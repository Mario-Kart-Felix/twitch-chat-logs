[0:01:28] <ScreamLord> Yeah, fun times with Grandpa Farm
[0:01:31] <siennakhan> ghost busting time
[0:02:41] <heytakeiteasyterry> howdy eli
[0:03:06] <examplez0> And we're back
[0:03:24] <BillieNoMates> howdy Plague
[0:03:38] <heytakeiteasyterry> hows kentucky?
[0:03:39] <BillieNoMates> Back to more griping!
[0:03:45] <examplez0> All 6 of us
[0:03:51] <KaiserMario> Someone's dressing up for the stream...
[0:04:16] <ScreamLord> My internet also died yesterday
[0:06:21] <ScreamLord> Remember to Rotate your saves
[0:06:32] <+NmyLogan> sup plague
[0:06:39] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Don't you wish there was a "save materia equipped slot" feature?
[0:06:44] <+CrimsonDio11> so did you beat Bahamut? Kappa
[0:07:03] <siennakhan> spooking time
[0:07:15] <%Samex_Comex> Wowie zowie!
[0:07:19] <+NmyLogan> what chapter are you on?
[0:07:43] <siennakhan> ch 14?
[0:08:03] <siennakhan> or ch 15
[0:08:13] <%caramello_man> Wow plague, your streaming hours are coconuts
[0:08:22] <ScreamLord> 16
[0:09:22] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes What's the best way to level Materia?
[0:10:19] <C24U> Is it because limited materia and mastering doesn't birth copies?
[0:10:27] <siennakhan> your streams help me focus when drawing. thanks. :D
[0:10:41] <examplez0> No counter materia either
[0:10:59] <Incognitohat> All materia reduced the damage of spells in the original as well, but yeah, there's not enough blue materia in this game
[0:11:00] <+HawkGoggles2> Got to go unlock that AP up Kappa
[0:11:01] <examplez0> And of course no double AP slots
[0:11:03] <Incognitohat> Only one magnify really, really sucks
[0:11:33] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> IS IT TIME PLAGUE
[0:11:59] <BillieNoMates> well you attack much faster now
[0:13:49] <+whiskywolfe> Sounds like an extremely well balanced mana mechanic
[0:13:51] <BillieNoMates> Its basically an efficiency materia
[0:14:08] <examplez0> So basically it's worthless
[0:14:18] <GiygasDrillBreak> MP is more valuable in this game than OG
[0:14:21] <+whiskywolfe> Yeah it's complete garbage.
[0:14:26] <ScreamLord> With those numbers It might as well not be in the game at all
[0:14:36] <+swaggopotamus> Sounds like they were trying a little too hard to keep things balanced.
[0:14:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> level 50 here, 82 MP. level 50 in OG was like 300 MP
[0:14:49] <examplez0> One thing I really hate is that you cannot sell the vast majority of materia
[0:14:52] <%Heiwajima_Nero> Heiwajima_Nero subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I don't come here often but have some love during these dark times.
[0:15:43] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, the cutscene booby traps
[0:15:49] <Futurecity10> plague
[0:15:50] <+HawkGoggles2> Free item use.
[0:15:52] <Futurecity10> what the fuck
[0:15:57] <Futurecity10> its 2am
[0:16:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> SE is bad at realtime game design, shocker
[0:17:21] <SuperVaderMan> atb seems essential to everything, I'm not surprised that the most effective build is regaining it fast as possible
[0:17:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> the devs realized how OP everything was and decided to bind it all to ATB
[0:18:25] <+Neoripo> Yeah, after all ATB is how you did attacks before, so it seems normal ATB attacks would be a priority
[0:18:40] <BillieNoMates> our man Pat
[0:18:45] <+HawkGoggles2> Just as round.
[0:18:49] <+whiskywolfe> A Japanese developer changing the story from "Wutai learns to accept loss" to "Wutai was wronged" really bothers me.
[0:18:50] <mrgaster8> wha
[0:19:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> OG game actually said ShinRa tried to build a reactor at Wutai, Wutai said no, Shinra invades
[0:19:28] <%Samex_Comex> Go up the down escalator fight the machine!
[0:19:32] <+Neoripo> Did you get purple pain?
[0:20:21] <+whiskywolfe> Yeah but Wutai was the Japan stand in and the clear analogy was WW2, and a generation learning to accept loss.
[0:20:44] <SuperVaderMan> Who's been tickling my butt cheeks again
[0:20:47] <+whiskywolfe> Now it's like "Actually maybe we'll win this time, like we always should've!"
[0:20:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah but there was no evidence in OG that Wutai deserved the war
[0:20:51] <mrgaster8> lol
[0:21:05] <+whiskywolfe> Deserving it has nothing to do with it.
[0:21:09] <majeser> there's no china stand in lol
[0:21:30] <Jay444111> Hey Plague, How ya doing?
[0:21:46] <+Neoripo> Men don't ask for directions @PlagueOfGripes
[0:22:06] <ScreamLord> Cloud has a bunch a funny indignant moments
[0:22:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> the original still made it clear wutai was the defending belligerant
[0:22:15] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Say, if you ever got hired to write a story for "Star Trek", would you favor your own ideas, or try to appease the fanbase by giving them what they expect?
[0:22:24] <+whiskywolfe> It was a reflection of post-war Japsn, now it looks like it'll be nationalist wish-fulfillment.
[0:22:26] <siennakhan> prostitute?
[0:22:35] <Jay444111> This world has weird tech
[0:22:45] <%Samex_Comex> Photo copy your butt and send it to shinra
[0:22:48] <BillieNoMates> Don't respond to psychos
[0:22:50] <ScreamLord> Beta Max died even harder than VHS did
[0:22:58] <+Neoripo> SOLDIER's are weird. Don't make eye contact
[0:23:06] <+whiskywolfe> I grew up in Northern Ireland. I could do that with entire towns.
[0:23:06] <examplez0> I've done that
[0:23:10] <+Neoripo> Also yeah, it's fucking weird
[0:23:15] <Maids4lyfe> yeah
[0:23:33] <jo_vo> I loved after hours at school when everyone left.
[0:23:37] <examplez0> In high school we'd always duck into empty computer rooms to play CS 1.6
[0:23:46] <+GreenCMD> being in school out of regular hours feels like your in fallout.
[0:23:57] <+RagnvaldPM> I didn't know you streamed sweet
[0:23:58] <siennakhan> o the rooster teeth thing
[0:24:22] <+HawkGoggles2> Use the anime boy or the giant black man.... go with giant man.
[0:24:26] <examplez0> Isn't this remake supposed to fix the plotholes of the original, not create even more?
[0:24:40] <BillieNoMates> Not really
[0:24:44] <siennakhan> no
[0:24:47] <BillieNoMates> This remake is it's own thing
[0:24:49] <Sokumotanaka> Ib4 black joke
[0:24:51] <jo_vo> There's only one Twisty's I know and it ain't a person
[0:25:02] <+Neoripo> No, it's not EU
[0:25:03] <+CrimsonDio11> yeah the weirdest name like Boivan @PlagueOfGripes Kappa
[0:25:16] <+Neoripo> it vaguely sounds italian tho
[0:25:29] <+Mekhet09> How have you enjoyed the game so far just asking I haven't seen your streams on this because I just beat the game.
[0:25:39] <BillieNoMates> Cloud wants to sniff the seats
[0:25:39] <ScreamLord> AND?
[0:25:41] <+whiskywolfe> Tifa we're here to murder people for fuck's sake who cares about the bathroom.
[0:25:46] <turbofolk> What the fuck plague is 1 in the morning
[0:25:46] <$vampireinarm> we finishing tonight?
[0:26:02] <+HawkGoggles2> But boys. cooties.
[0:26:03] <$vampireinarm> its barely 11:40
[0:26:13] <SuperVaderMan> Just dress cloud up in drag again and it'll be fine. Dress Barret in drag too
[0:26:15] <%Samex_Comex> I can go into any bathroom I want
[0:26:19] <+ratreborn> lmfao
[0:26:21] <examplez0> She's read enough doujins to know where this is going
[0:26:21] <BillieNoMates> Are there no doors?
[0:26:22] <turbofolk> its 1:40 am where i am
[0:26:26] <+whiskywolfe> wait did Barrett just say he wanted to show them his dick
[0:26:29] <BillieNoMates> h they are just open
[0:26:31] <+Neoripo> He has a lot of Gripes with the game, so yeah, Plague is enjoying the videogame in his own way
[0:26:39] <london_flexing> Honestly, we need a new name for remakes that cause majors parts of the Canon, or will that give too much a way?
[0:26:43] <terminusterminal> Japan bathrooms are like that
[0:26:43] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[0:26:44] <$vampireinarm> its a snobby corporate building bathroom
[0:26:48] <$vampireinarm> they probably dont even use it
[0:26:52] <+HawkGoggles2> did the game save, I remember people having soft locks with the air ducts.
[0:27:01] <%Samex_Comex> Yup
[0:27:03] <+ratreborn> Damn, people are still complaining about the game?
[0:27:04] <+GreenCMD> the long style urinals are a horror
[0:27:04] <rib64> it's called not wanting to sit
[0:27:08] <jo_vo> Yup
[0:27:12] <examplez0> Wait what
[0:27:19] <jo_vo> SHotgun in the corner of the handicap toilet
[0:27:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> i can vouch, i cleaned bathrooms for Target
[0:27:25] <$vampireinarm> My GF used to work as a janitor at a mall, ive heard the horror stories of the women's bathroom
[0:27:27] <turbofolk> Elementary boys restrooms where i live are a fucking biohazard
[0:27:27] <BillieNoMates> Women are gross in general
[0:27:30] <+Neoripo> Sounds like a woman's bathroom alright
[0:27:30] <jo_vo> With TP piled on top of it
[0:27:31] <SuperVaderMan> It's my chance, now I can explode
[0:27:41] <HiddenPorpoise> Shit on the ceiling is something that just happens in women's bathrooms and no one knows how or why
[0:27:43] <heytakeiteasyterry> ive had to clean both in my life and in my experience womens restrooms tend to be dirtier ive had to clean alot of feces and period blood and other liquids in my time
[0:27:44] <+whiskywolfe> Back when I worked my side job in a Starbucks a lady gave birth in our bathroom. We only found out when blood dripped out under the door.
[0:27:46] <Jay444111> Yep. Womens bathrooms are horrifying.
[0:27:51] <arkv01> yeah tifa you're gonna get pregnant if you stay in the mens washroom too long
[0:27:52] <rittergeist> I've had to pick up so many used maxi pads it's not even funny.
[0:28:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> men's bathrooms = overrall filth, women's bathrooms = one super nasty death landmine
[0:28:04] <examplez0> @whiskywolfe Haha oh wow
[0:28:12] <Dementedpenguin> I can attest to having cleaned women's restrooms. The toilet seat is disgusting.....
[0:28:16] <+Neoripo> Here only 1 HP up materia
[0:28:21] <Sokumotanaka> Awww no barret in the vents this time
[0:28:21] <+CrimsonDio11> man Plague you and Max are in the general same area and its fucking me up trying to figure out who to watch

[0:29:31] <$vampireinarm> did he never get the Mythril sword?
[0:29:33] <+ratreborn> so does Plague know the spoilers? Or are yall just shouting out future stuff?
[0:29:33] <+GreenCMD> which gender's bathroom is do combo and which one is big number?
[0:29:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:29:36] <gunsrlove> Ay. it's Gripesman stream again
[0:29:37] <heytakeiteasyterry> tifa don't want no five minute man now cloud
[0:29:40] <KaiserMario> This is no MGS
[0:29:50] <+Neoripo> Realistic vent controls. This man is no gordon freeman
[0:29:53] <TheWe4pon> unreal engine?
[0:29:58] <arkv01> these employees fuckin?
[0:30:04] <turbofolk> oh hey japanese office room

[0:30:05] <+whiskywolfe> Honto ne?!
[0:30:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeh unreal engine
[0:30:07] <%Samex_Comex> Makeout!
[0:30:12] <examplez0> If you go in and out of the vent 6 times can you see Scarlet in her panties?
[0:30:15] <$vampireinarm> @GreenCMD Men's is big combo because its consistent, women's is BIg number because it spikes in disgusting
[0:30:28] <tokenreefer> did he go stairs or elevator?
[0:30:40] <+Neoripo> They could fit 3 barrets
[0:30:42] <examplez0> Stairs
[0:30:46] <arkv01> "we may work on ff7r-2 and ff8r simultaneously
[0:30:55] <tokenreefer> good stuff
[0:30:59] <+Neoripo> i hope not
[0:31:01] <+ratreborn> they never said that
[0:31:18] <Sokumotanaka> Reeve is the director right?
[0:31:28] <examplez0> I hope they remake FF6 and go full Nomura mode on it just to troll the 6 fanboys
[0:31:29] <+Neoripo> Everytime SE does more then 1 thing at the same time, shit gets delayed
[0:31:37] <TheWe4pon> what about the gay men pool scene?
[0:31:50] <Sokumotanaka> @examplez0 fuck you leave ff6 alone
[0:31:52] <turbofolk> Plague do you think nomuira will try to tie FF7R into the new KH saga?
[0:31:53] <tokenreefer> you gotta remake ff10
[0:32:01] <arkv01> kinda nuts when you think about the timespan they pumped out ff7 - ff9
[0:32:17] <arkv01> let's just go back to pre-rendered backgrounds and blocky limbs
[0:32:24] <examplez0> Back when The Gooch was there to keep everyone on track
[0:32:36] <+Neoripo> Gotta say, FF8 would greatly benefit from voice acting and game balance
[0:32:40] <gunsrlove> Clang clink kachunk clang
[0:32:46] <%Samex_Comex> Good thing your sword fits
[0:32:56] <$vampireinarm> !uptime
[0:32:56] <@Nightbot> 33 minutes 8 seconds
[0:33:09] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Movement may be restricted to avoid clipping
[0:33:12] <arkv01> I love ff8 but I never want to hear that cast talk into my ears
[0:33:23] <turbofolk> MOMMY SCARLET!! WHENS HER SFM MODEL
[0:33:29] <Futurecity10> Does heidiger ever get it?
[0:33:38] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> STOP TRYING TO TELL ME ANYTHING THAT ISNT VIOLANCE
[0:33:42] <examplez0> Remake FF8 but make Laguna the main character
[0:33:46] <Sokumotanaka> so no change from the old game where reeve and hojo are the only smart ones
[0:33:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> 10 gil = $1 in 1997 = $2 today. Sector 7 cost LESS than 1 World Trade Center
[0:33:53] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It baffles me that Shinra thought destroying 2/16ths was worth killing 6 people. Especially since it only killed 3 of them with the surviving 3 being their biggest threats
[0:34:11] <+whiskywolfe> What does President Shinra even want Reeve to say here? He knows what he's going to say and shuts him down each time.
[0:34:14] <+ratreborn> so can we expect any Scarlet art from Plague?
[0:34:15] <tokenreefer> just make ff16 and not have it suck
[0:34:16] <+Neoripo> In FF9 they even outsorced a ton of the backgrounds
[0:34:18] <arkv01> prez, just having the ancient isn't a surefire plan
[0:34:22] <seth45er> Super DISNEY LAND REEVE!
[0:34:23] <$jamarartdoodles> America in a nutshell lol
[0:34:29] <terminusterminal> Reeve is too sensible for this Board of Directors
[0:34:35] <arkv01> reeves trying to lay down raw reason
[0:34:36] <+Neoripo> Reeve, the only human
[0:34:43] <+GreenCMD> prez, you can't build a city on a gofundme
[0:34:43] <turbofolk> No time for humanarism
[0:34:47] <seth45er> PURE BLOOD muther
[0:34:47] <tokenreefer> reeve is not evil enough
[0:34:49] <TheWe4pon> Hot
[0:34:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> in OG, Shinra actually RAISES Reeve's budget, despite shutting him down
[0:34:49] <+whiskywolfe> Japan, Plague, Japan.
[0:34:52] <arkv01> they been inbreeding for thousands of years
[0:34:59] <arkv01> and aerith is the product
[0:35:05] <turbofolk> Well pure as close as it going to get
[0:35:07] <Futurecity10> ancients are immune to inbreeding
[0:35:14] <+CrimsonDio11> god why did I always get Ifalna and Lucretia mixed up @PlagueOfGripes
[0:35:18] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the whole room lights up at the mention of torture
[0:35:19] <tokenreefer> i mean she does think flowers are speaking to her
[0:35:19] <SuperVaderMan> Tee hee, torture 4Head
[0:35:19] <ScreamLord> That tree was a straight line
[0:35:20] <Sokumotanaka> Ewwww still bad
[0:35:31] <turbofolk> Oh boy red rocket
[0:35:33] <$vampireinarm> theres still creepy stuff
[0:35:40] <arkv01> B R E E D
[0:35:41] <$vampireinarm> YEAH BREED
[0:35:46] <+ratreborn> BREED
[0:35:49] <Sokumotanaka> KNOTTED
[0:35:50] <turbofolk> LIKE A DOG
[0:35:51] <arkv01> wow, thats reasonable hojo
[0:35:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's no reason Aeris's father wasnt an ancient, he just died too soon. Shinra just implied it right now because Ifalna didn't die in the lab, but Aeris's father could have
[0:35:52] <+ratreborn> G
[0:35:55] <+ratreborn> G TYPES
[0:35:55] <arkv01> where's the doggos?
[0:35:55] <tokenreefer> aerith go a couple extra chromosomes
[0:35:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> S = Sephiroth, G = Genesis
[0:36:02] <+whiskywolfe> Nomura...
[0:36:03] <+CrimsonDio11> Genesis types
[0:36:03] <turbofolk> Remember Genesis??
[0:36:03] <+Mekhet09> CC
[0:36:04] <+ratreborn> G.....GENESIS!
[0:36:11] <arkv01> oh NO GENESIS IS CANON
[0:36:16] <terminusterminal> Oh no it IS Sephiroth and Genesis types
[0:36:17] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the fact that they acknowledge gackt is dumb as fuck
[0:36:20] <terminusterminal> whyyyyyyyy
[0:36:26] <TheWe4pon> breed her, breed her, breed her!
[0:36:32] <Futurecity10> Lol genesis is canon?
[0:36:32] <BrachyZoid> They were poor, for these guys they didn't count as people
[0:36:39] <tokenreefer> bread her
[0:36:40] <$vampireinarm> something is getting shoved up someones butt
[0:36:42] <Sokumotanaka> To be fair bestially is gross
[0:36:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> good news is Genesis and Weiss dont appear in this game
[0:36:46] <examplez0> Yeah the Sega Genesis is canon
[0:36:47] <MartiusGW> of course genesis is canon
[0:36:48] <+Neoripo> Genesis who? That does not exist nuh-uh
[0:36:49] <seth45er> GACKT TYPE!
[0:36:54] <+Mekhet09> Get ready for the nomura roller coaster.
[0:36:56] <seth45er> lol
[0:36:59] <tokenreefer> mother....
[0:37:02] <heytakeiteasyterry> tell me why tell me what you want idk why idk why you came
[0:37:03] <$jamarartdoodles> They killed people but breeding is icky lol
[0:37:04] <+ratreborn> Nojima rollercoaster*
[0:37:08] <BrachyZoid> NotLikeThis
[0:37:14] <+GreenCMD> it's the RE G-Virus type
[0:37:15] <mrgaster8> MOTHER
[0:37:17] <gunsrlove> Release The Gackt Cut
[0:37:17] <arkv01> aeris probably wouldn't object to fuckin gackt seeing as how cloud and gackt look similar
[0:37:20] <%Samex_Comex> Wash your hands
[0:37:26] <examplez0> Safer Sephiroth had one black wing and six white ones
[0:37:30] <Maids4lyfe> shinra bathroom better than my entire house
[0:37:37] <Futurecity10> Was gachkts character Genesis?
[0:37:38] <turbofolk> Yeah fancy restroom smell terrible sometimes
[0:37:38] <tokenreefer> JEN...O...VA
[0:37:50] <BrachyZoid> Such a bountiful mine
[0:37:51] <tokenreefer> mother....
[0:37:55] <Rodzzila> what a rat face LUL
[0:37:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> Hojo's face-rigging is so bad
[0:38:08] <+Neoripo> Hojo WOULD talk to himself
[0:38:16] <arkv01> I thought the one winged thing was some kind of religious reference for a while
[0:38:19] <BrachyZoid> Edge
[0:38:19] <examplez0> After he became the Demonic Angel
[0:38:23] <seth45er> fallen angle
[0:38:25] <examplez0> Because Nomura
[0:38:27] <+Mekhet09> Symbolism.
[0:38:29] <tokenreefer> edgey bby
[0:38:31] <+whiskywolfe> Yes. It's because it's a neat visual.
[0:38:34] <Maids4lyfe> it looks like they're part divine
[0:38:37] <+axenred> Nomura loves sephiroth
[0:38:40] <%LordSDB> I think it got pushed really hard after KH1
[0:38:42] <BrachyZoid> Japan LOVES the bible
[0:38:43] <gunsrlove> hot take: Sephiroth always looked goofy to me ;/
[0:38:44] <examplez0> And in Kingdom Hearts, Sephiroth was the Darkness in Cloud's heart
[0:38:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> in CC, 1-wing = 2 seperate halves of a perfect being
[0:38:44] <%bettysharkface> His mouth is too big and makes me kinda recoil
[0:38:50] <siennakhan> it was his design in kh
[0:38:54] <CursedNobleman> the virgin one winged angel vs the chad aroused kefka
[0:38:55] <+CrimsonDio11> because one winged angel is their most successful song
[0:38:56] <BrachyZoid> Even Riku in Kingdom Hearts had the one wing thing
[0:38:56] <tokenreefer> shadow the hedgehog syndrome
[0:39:00] <Sokumotanaka> His wings were upsidedown too, kefkas
[0:39:05] <+Mekhet09> Because nomura.
[0:39:09] <siennakhan> they add it to his design
[0:39:16] <@Nightbot> @sad_toast_ -> Jackpot! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:39:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura REALLY LOVES KFC
[0:39:22] <examplez0> YOU GET A WING AND YOU GET A WING AND YOU GET A WING
[0:39:25] <+Neoripo> Jenova should have wings then
[0:39:26] <+CrimsonDio11> @Mekhet09 I dont think Nomura worked on Crisis Core though
[0:39:33] <BrachyZoid> Think of Nomura as every High Schooler. They have their edgy half angel OCs
[0:39:33] <+CrimsonDio11> or Advent Children
[0:39:42] <Maids4lyfe> Ultimate Kars
[0:39:43] <examplez0> Nomura was directed by Tabata
[0:39:44] <TheWe4pon> wasn't his song name one winged angle?
[0:39:45] <tokenreefer> jen...o...va
[0:39:56] <tokenreefer> mother....
[0:40:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's always the same 6 men at SE
[0:40:04] <examplez0> So to be fair Nomura isn't the only cancer killing Final Fantasy
[0:40:08] <examplez0> But it started with him
[0:40:11] <arkv01> despite all the stupid shit from nomura's wild ride, it does get people talkin even if we're shitting on him
[0:40:12] <Sokumotanaka> I feel like in advent children got too popular and they latched onto that and tried to expand on things that make ff7 worse and worse than it already was
[0:40:17] <+valiard> Icrisis core basically said it was a side effect of the soldier program
[0:40:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nojima, Nomura, Tabata, Kitase, Toriyama, Hashimoto
[0:40:37] <+ratreborn> people meme Nomura as the sole reason why somethings bad, when Nojima is the main writer.
[0:40:41] <arkv01> jenovo cells are in energy drinks ScaredyCat
[0:40:41] <+ratreborn> for almost all of the spin offs
[0:40:43] <Sokumotanaka> Redbull gives you wings!?
[0:40:47] <examplez0> Advent Children was cool when I was 14 but just gets worse and worse and worwse upon every rewatch
[0:40:49] <BillieNoMates> Jenova sorta has wings in the chamber
[0:40:56] <BillieNoMates> But after that it changes
[0:40:58] <terminusterminal> Sephiroth is pat and drank a lot of redbull
[0:41:00] <Sokumotanaka> @examplez0 For real right?
[0:41:01] <+Mekhet09> This is nomura's vision of the game and he's the head director.
[0:41:02] <arkv01> nomura loves wings n shit
[0:41:04] <BrachyZoid> I love me my cronenberg monsters
[0:41:10] <Maids4lyfe> I blame Jojo
[0:41:13] <examplez0> @ratreborn And Motomu "I want to lick Lightning's armpits" Toriyama
[0:41:13] <tokenreefer> bull sperm
[0:41:23] <kuzokai> I think it's a kingdom hearts thing
[0:41:28] <+ratreborn> Nomura mostly just does art and KH
[0:41:37] <arkv01> I will take nomura over toriyama 9.5 times out of 10
[0:41:42] <examplez0> @Sokumotanaka Funnily enough I actually liked Advent Children before I got into FF7 proper
[0:41:44] <kuzokai> that's the first time I remember it being made a big deal
[0:41:55] <tokenreefer> jenova = bull sperm
[0:41:58] <+whiskywolfe> Oh you dump exposition when you're alone?
[0:42:02] <examplez0> But the more I became a fan of OG FF7 the more I grew to hate AC and the rest of the compilation
[0:42:09] <TheWe4pon> who was the original writer for ff7?
[0:42:11] <Sokumotanaka> @examplez0 Oh you poor person that must of sucked with age
[0:42:14] <+ratreborn> Nojima
[0:42:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF7 had committee writing
[0:42:25] <heytakeiteasyterry> "i want to bend cloud over"-jessie
[0:42:30] <$vampireinarm> its convenient design for the imagery
[0:42:43] <examplez0> @TheWe4pon Nojima, Nomura, Sakaguchi and Kitase
[0:42:44] <sad_toast_> Scientist guy reminds me of that guys with the same glasses from Devil may Cry 4
[0:42:45] <+Neoripo> Maybe the wing is a manifestation of jenova-infused people believing thenselves gods and mutating to achieve that. Just my asspull though
[0:42:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura and Kitase wrote, Toriyama arranged scenes
[0:42:50] <tokenreefer> rain on me cloud"-jessie
[0:43:01] <ScreamLord> The only reason Jenova looks human is because it took the form of a Centra and went dormant half way through turning into a Cronenburg
[0:43:04] <+Mekhet09> I do.
[0:43:06] <$vampireinarm> they look impractical as all fuck
[0:43:08] <CursedNobleman> wouldnt work for me LUL
[0:43:10] <tokenreefer> rain on my face cloud- jessie
[0:43:11] <Sokumotanaka> I love ozzy ozborn
[0:43:11] <BrachyZoid> Immediately think evil
[0:43:11] <examplez0> @Sokumotanaka You get used to it after a while
[0:43:17] <sosuke5> Hard to pull off
[0:43:17] <GiygasDrillBreak> i hate circular glasses, even Lord Il Palazzo cant make them work
[0:43:22] <sad_toast_> oooh yeah I dig them
[0:43:24] <+Neoripo> Sign of evil
[0:43:25] <CursedNobleman> "long drawn out faces" Okay, might work for me LUL
[0:43:26] <mrgaster8> i have a pair and it make me look like a stoner
[0:43:28] <%bettysharkface> You need skeleton face to pull it off
[0:43:29] <MartiusGW> i wonder if Toriyama will add Lightning in next part
[0:43:35] <jggoryl> convenient if you hate drawing eyes
[0:43:39] <sad_toast_> egg man glasses
[0:43:44] <%bettysharkface> But big circle glasses look cute on round faces
[0:43:45] <seth45er> i wore some and it made me looked like butterball from hell raiser
[0:43:46] <examplez0> Lightning is already canon to every FF universe
[0:43:58] <twenty112> John Lennon pulled them off
[0:43:58] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes hey can't you pair cloud with some else or automatic arieth?
[0:43:59] <arkv01> you'll get used to the spankings
[0:44:16] <cyberblueneon> hojo looks like the main character from comix zone
[0:44:32] <mrgaster8> o wait
[0:44:34] <tokenreefer> these next parts are the worst
[0:44:38] <CursedNobleman> salazar giggle run LUL
[0:44:38] <arkv01> if they default to aeris only in the next episode, there gonna be some beef
[0:44:39] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes good i hate areith
[0:44:43] <examplez0> Oh no the same enemies you've already been fighting
[0:44:45] <+CrimsonDio11> ah yes the cthulu monster fight
[0:44:47] <+Neoripo> Hojo is a crazy asshole
[0:44:48] <+spacehouse> now he just saunters away OH NO
[0:44:51] <+Mekhet09> They aren't generic.
[0:44:53] <SuperVaderMan> This is my monster button
[0:44:59] <examplez0> @tokenreefer Not until Hojo's puzzles
[0:45:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> Aeris was default in OG, she started with the highest score for the date
[0:45:09] <%Samex_Comex> What the fuck is that!?
[0:45:09] <Sokumotanaka> That's a mass effect creature!
[0:45:09] <+Neoripo> That is a good question
[0:45:09] <+axenred> remember this is the man that makes Kingdom Hearts, don't question bad directing here
[0:45:16] <tokenreefer> yeah that part
[0:45:16] <+spacehouse> If only there was some1 with magic or a GUN that could stop him from WALKING INTO AN ELEVATOR
[0:45:23] <arkv01> I need to see that cloud and barret scene on the gondola in this remake
[0:45:24] <CursedNobleman> definitely cthulu-ey but good design i think
[0:45:25] <Sokumotanaka> Agreed
[0:45:27] <ScreamLord> Berret is awesome
[0:45:36] <+spacehouse> Barret and Marlene best in game
[0:45:38] <tokenreefer> but hearts and darkness...
[0:45:39] <suitangi021> Barret is the greatest part of the game
[0:45:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> Barret is what happens when Mr T evolves into Black Isrealite Mr T
[0:45:48] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes shes too nice and she got better character development but i don't like her as a character
[0:45:50] <sad_toast_> I was going to go to sleep but I want to see Grapes reaction to things to come 🤔
[0:45:56] <arkv01> suddenly KPOP
[0:46:05] <BrachyZoid> Yeah kind of out of nowhere
[0:46:14] <+ratreborn> Aerith is cute at the Corneo Mansion
[0:46:15] <$vampireinarm> The dance scene is 100% fourth wall breaking fan service that will never be referenced again
[0:46:16] <kingra> Still all high eh?
[0:46:17] <+Neoripo> It was not willingly tho
[0:46:19] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I don't him have any strong feelings towards Aerith, I always thought she was about the same level aas Quistis from 8...
[0:46:25] <examplez0> She's nowhere near as annoying as she was in Crisis Core
[0:46:29] <tokenreefer> get ready to swap materia every 15 mins
[0:46:30] <examplez0> That game fucked her character so badly
[0:46:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> Aeris's dresses for Corneo range from ratty skank to $2 skank
[0:46:46] <+Mekhet09> Yeah it's this boss.
[0:47:00] <+Mekhet09> They switch it around.
[0:47:00] <+whiskywolfe> This is it's name
[0:47:01] <CursedNobleman> specimen 512 sounds right
[0:47:07] <+ratreborn> @examplez0 CC was pretty good
[0:47:08] <BrachyZoid> LUL
[0:47:10] <arkv01> red's got materia in deez nuts
[0:47:17] <+ratreborn> if not pretty epic
[0:47:20] <arkv01> also his tail's on fire
[0:47:21] <Maids4lyfe> red rocket materia
[0:47:23] <Sokumotanaka> Maybe so you didn't have to buy one?
[0:47:26] <examplez0> @ratreborn Eh nah not really
[0:47:35] <+ratreborn> simple straight forward 20 hour game
[0:47:37] <cyberblueneon> cloud having a musical number where he sings about his feelings would have been better than a dumb dance number
[0:47:40] <examplez0> It could have been good if not for Genesis and Angeal
[0:47:46] <+ratreborn> Angeals good
[0:47:51] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes you been drinking enough orange juice and staying healthy during this outbreak i hope
[0:47:52] <examplez0> And if it didn't flanderize the fuck out of the original characters
[0:47:52] <+ratreborn> Genesis is just why
[0:48:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> Cloud came from a boring mountain town, his mom trained him to be in a boy band. It was the 90s.
[0:48:12] <arkv01> angeal was good until he overstayed his screen time
[0:48:12] <tokenreefer> the fact that they lock a music disc pisses me off
[0:48:16] <+Neoripo> The problem with Aeris is she has so much sass that sometimes it's hard to know if she means some of the things she says
[0:48:23] <examplez0> I remember Angeal being very bland and just a walking plot device for Zack to inherit the buster sword from
[0:48:31] <ScreamLord> I don't like how enemies focus 95% on the characters you take control of. It makes the Provoke Materia nearly worthless and it makes encounters more annoying than they need to be
[0:48:33] <Sokumotanaka> Why is Vilgax here?
[0:48:36] <examplez0> But yeah Genesis is the worst the worst the absolute worst
[0:49:04] <+GreenCMD> this is quite the resident evil final boss design
[0:49:10] <%Samex_Comex> Give me the omnitrix Cloud!
[0:49:20] <tokenreefer> gotta use provoke materia
[0:49:27] <+Neoripo> The thing is, the focus on player character can be abused by regularly switching
[0:49:28] <arkv01> this boss's design is quite faithful to the original
[0:49:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> provoke doesnt work
[0:49:32] <samuelfisk> “For you there is no tomorrow”
[0:49:36] <Sokumotanaka> @Samex_Comex XDDD
[0:49:42] <NineBall3D> aerith is super manipulative in this game, i guess thats one reason why ppl hate her
[0:49:44] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:49:45] <tokenreefer> WHAT?!
[0:49:49] <+ratreborn> whens Red XIV comin out
[0:49:56] <examplez0> @NineBall3D She was always like that
[0:50:21] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes hope that thing happens to areith again...don't spoil it though
[0:50:25] <tokenreefer> aerith just doesnt feel like shed put out
[0:50:27] <examplez0> Except in Crisis Core she was just some bimbo airhead
[0:50:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> why is he Red XIII, there was never a Red I through Red XII
[0:50:39] <arkv01> brain powrd!
[0:50:39] <TheWe4pon> man I hate the summon limitations in this game
[0:50:43] <terminusterminal> His brain just gets bigger and bigger
[0:50:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> Aerith was only like, 17 in CC
[0:50:56] <+Neoripo> I would not say manipulative, but more like playful. But the way Aerith interacts can't be discussed until the end of the game
[0:50:58] <Maids4lyfe> increase brains
[0:50:58] <+ratreborn> she was also younger in CC
[0:51:01] <+Mekhet09> Yeah it sucks.
[0:51:03] <%Samex_Comex> Now you have to make new numbers
[0:51:10] <+Mekhet09> Staggering you is bullshit.
[0:51:13] <tokenreefer> so how old is cloud? he needs some too
[0:51:17] <NineBall3D> @examplez0 thats why ppl hate her in your opinion?
[0:51:21] <heytakeiteasyterry> @plagueofgripes this boss is a huge ork and is colorblind since you say he has big brains must be an oddboy be careful plague
[0:51:23] <examplez0> He;s 21 in this game
[0:51:32] <examplez0> @NineBall3D I don't know why people hate her
[0:51:33] <tokenreefer> and aerith?
[0:51:38] <+Neoripo> 1 year old Kappa
[0:51:43] <tokenreefer> lmao
[0:51:50] <+Neoripo> Aerith is 22-23
[0:51:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> Cloud is 21
[0:51:55] <+ratreborn> 23
[0:52:00] <%caramello_man> Live and Learn!
[0:52:02] <arkv01> the tentacle beard is a nice touch
[0:52:06] <tokenreefer> he should get some booty
[0:52:11] <%Samex_Comex> Go my babies
[0:52:17] <tokenreefer> tifa is the only option
[0:52:41] <ManNamedQ> Cloud could be drowning in booty if he wanted. He has options.
[0:52:47] <+Neoripo> Babies going nuts
[0:52:49] <+Mekhet09> Blizzard sucks
[0:52:53] <+ratreborn> this section is so long
[0:52:53] <heytakeiteasyterry> oh god everyone is poisoned now
[0:53:00] <tokenreefer> nah you cant get.
[0:53:02] <+Mekhet09> It misses like 90% of the time because of how it works.
[0:53:08] <NineBall3D> best girl for cloud is his mom Kreygasm
[0:53:17] <tokenreefer> cant get booty from npcs
[0:53:18] <+Neoripo> Yeah, blizzard having delay is terrible
[0:53:25] <heytakeiteasyterry> aren't clouds parents dead
[0:53:30] <+ratreborn> yes
[0:53:36] <tokenreefer> cloud = odeipus
[0:53:46] <+Neoripo> Blizzard should slow movement to compensate
[0:53:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> ironically, Cloud's father is a complete unknown
[0:53:53] <+Mekhet09> Tifa staggers.
[0:53:53] <+ratreborn> i know who is father is
[0:53:57] <+ratreborn> me
[0:54:01] <ManNamedQ> So you're saying Cloud is into incestuous necrophilia
[0:54:06] <tokenreefer> mother....
[0:54:17] <sad_toast_> EZ
[0:54:23] <tokenreefer> jen...o...va
[0:54:26] <TheWe4pon> weapon maybe in lab
[0:54:26] <$vampireinarm> yeah its weird as fuck
[0:54:31] <+Neoripo> Terrible
[0:54:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> blizzard/aero animations were probably made in 2015 for turn-based
[0:54:37] <Huntercd> Did I miss cat dog?
[0:54:44] <+Neoripo> could be
[0:54:45] <+Mekhet09> Aero has better delay.
[0:54:51] <+Neoripo> shhh
[0:54:52] <+Neoripo> no
[0:54:55] <heytakeiteasyterry> would you play an ff8 remake?
[0:54:59] <+Mekhet09> But yeah.
[0:55:08] <+MrPervSan> @heytakeiteasyterry I would
[0:55:10] <+GreenCMD> ice is the worst in that regard
[0:55:10] <+Mekhet09> I can hit things with aero.
[0:55:13] <tokenreefer> its almost like its the same game engine
[0:55:18] <+firmlygraspi1> at least spells feel different from each other, unlike Bioshock Infinite
[0:55:18] <$vampireinarm> @GiygasDrillBreak its not even that, you throw the spell out instantly, but once it gets to the target it has a delay to proc the damage
[0:55:21] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes dont leave the room you can see red in there
[0:55:33] <+CrimsonDio11> red xiii I mean
[0:55:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> i thought that was the animation
[0:55:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> cuz CC has the same problem where the ice lump floats too long and the enemy walks away
[0:56:00] <examplez0> It wouldn't be so bad if attacking wasn't the only way to fill up the gauge
[0:56:10] <+Neoripo> oh boy
[0:56:11] <examplez0> Especially against enemies with invincibility phases
[0:56:13] <NineBall3D> LUL
[0:56:19] <$vampireinarm> you throw out the ice at them, it them makes the lump when it hits the enemy and later pops
[0:56:25] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I think ATB doesn't need to be used when using items
[0:56:29] <arkv01> theres the boi CorgiDerp
[0:56:34] <Sokumotanaka> MY BOY!
[0:56:35] <terminusterminal> What is Red XIII andyways?
[0:56:39] <$jamarartdoodles> Would love a FF8 remaster but it don't have that love like FF7 does :(
[0:56:40] <+Neoripo> nah
[0:56:41] <%Samex_Comex> With radical rocker hair
[0:56:41] <heytakeiteasyterry> game critics were saying this game is too easy imagine that
[0:56:43] <Explodincatz> what time is it?
[0:56:45] <$vampireinarm> or item usage should be non interruptable
[0:56:46] <Huntercd> Did Hojo try to get him to fuck?
[0:56:47] <Explodincatz> its yiffing time
[0:56:48] <theloganbrand> I think the kids pronounce it dojacat
[0:56:51] <tokenreefer> just wait till hard mode
[0:56:53] <GiygasDrillBreak> Red XIII actually says what he is, soon
[0:56:55] <examplez0> So can Aerith take the knot or not?
[0:57:00] <SenkoFluff> they did items since in ff15 items negated every fight
[0:57:06] <+ratreborn> @heytakeiteasyterry they said EASY mode was too EASY
[0:57:06] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Yeah and it shouldn't be that way I worded that previous comment wrong
[0:57:07] <$vampireinarm> or instant from the menu
[0:57:09] <+Mekhet09> refocus.
[0:57:11] <+GreenCMD> I'd like to see more in depth build in sequels but to do so they'd need to reduce the importance of element weakness.
[0:57:17] <theloganbrand> That's closer to XIII tbh
[0:57:27] <sad_toast_> mad scientist AF
[0:57:30] <examplez0> "Y'all bout to learn predictable!" Oh man
[0:57:31] <KaiserMario> @heytakeiteasyterry Thing is, with 8, the time travelling, timeline changing shenanigans, actually makes sense and is part of the plot
[0:57:32] <+Neoripo> Items being ATB free would break the game, just buy 100 grenades and win
[0:57:38] <NineBall3D> @examplez0 only if she casts regen while its going in
[0:58:02] <$vampireinarm> Items should still use ATB, but be non interruptable
[0:58:02] <+Neoripo> yep
[0:58:03] <Huntercd> He's jerking off right now
[0:58:12] <sad_toast_> @neoripo unlimited ammo
[0:58:18] <TheWe4pon> someone look up where cloud and aeriths last weapons are
[0:58:20] <sosuke5> Having a attack ATB and a item ATB might be a solution
[0:58:26] <examplez0> That was a quick one
[0:58:27] <heytakeiteasyterry> eh enjoy your water plague drink a whole gallon
[0:58:40] <+ratreborn> Aeriths last weapon is a Steal from the Eligor Chariot boss
[0:58:48] <+ratreborn> its the double speared staff
[0:58:50] <+GreenCMD> obviously we should be using Wizard101 pips
[0:58:51] <$vampireinarm> Cloud's last weapon is in an upcoming section, you cant miss it if you go down each corridor
[0:58:54] <+ratreborn> Clouds last weapon is coming up
[0:58:57] <+Mekhet09> That's her fourth weapon.
[0:58:57] <tokenreefer> nah she gets another one
[0:58:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> how about we slow down all the combat animations slightly, instead of the "animate everything on 2's"
[0:58:58] <+CrimsonDio11> do you think it would be better to just abandon the atb system?
[0:59:02] <+Mekhet09> Not her last weapon.
[0:59:04] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Hopefully SE will figure something out
[0:59:10] <examplez0> Use magic on the shield guys
[0:59:12] <tokenreefer> they are pretty obvious
[0:59:16] <Explodincatz> the ATB itself was a non turn based systam standin for the turn based nature of JRPG's
[0:59:22] <+Neoripo> I would add more ATB and if the spell is not launched, not lose ATB or MP
[0:59:26] <theloganbrand> Does remake of a new game +?
[0:59:33] <theloganbrand> have a***
[0:59:33] <+ratreborn> i just wish u didnt need ATB to use items
[0:59:35] <GiygasDrillBreak> ATB is basically a general cooldown
[0:59:38] <+GreenCMD> ATB is the best part of the game, even with its issues
[0:59:40] <heytakeiteasyterry> gotta get every character best weapon for that new game plus stuff
[0:59:44] <+CrimsonDio11> what if it recharged faster?
[0:59:49] <tokenreefer> yeah they have a new game + but it sucks
[1:00:00] <+ratreborn> its very risk to be low hp and have zero atb built up and having to attack to build it up
[1:00:04] <heytakeiteasyterry> i hope Vincent Valentine makes an appearance again
[1:00:08] <KaiserMario> "But Plague, you get a chapter select after you beat the game, and getting those items don't matter anymore..."
[1:00:12] <+Neoripo> Still better balance that FF8 junction Kappa
[1:00:12] <tokenreefer> cant use items in new game+
[1:00:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> i prefer CTB, less jank, and Atlus just kept running with it
[1:00:35] <examplez0> Use magic
[1:00:46] <$vampireinarm> You HAVE to get cloud's final sword, the ability it gives you is crucial for the last 2 boss fights
[1:00:53] <$vampireinarm> its BS
[1:01:02] <+ratreborn> its not that crucial
[1:01:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> where is it?
[1:01:10] <+ratreborn> i beat both of the last ones without it
[1:01:13] <examplez0> The twin stinger?
[1:01:18] <SenkoFluff> Woooo space ghooosts
[1:01:23] <$vampireinarm> its in a hallway in an upcoming section, as long as he looks around he cant miss it
[1:01:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> HOJO SUUUUUURF
[1:01:30] <Explodincatz> wow
[1:01:31] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, the time ghosts are kidnapping him
[1:01:32] <tokenreefer> space ghost to coast
[1:01:33] <terminusterminal> What eh thethet fuck?
[1:01:34] <sad_toast_> plot ghooooosssts
[1:01:35] <+Neoripo> Should have chapter select once you beat a chapter
[1:01:35] <%bettysharkface> WHat
[1:01:44] <arran_throttle> nah nah nah! 20 hours to early!
[1:01:47] <+Neoripo> could be patched
[1:01:48] <gunsrlove> What if the ghosts are actually GACKT
[1:01:49] <$vampireinarm> no creepy breeding section
[1:01:49] <+spacehouse> aww we just skip red rocket
[1:01:54] <TheWe4pon> oh, no breeding. :(
[1:01:56] <doggieo> BOOO
[1:01:59] <Huntercd> Hojo spent the entire conversation jerking
[1:02:05] <sad_toast_> Mechy bois
[1:02:09] <Sokumotanaka> GUNDAMS!
[1:02:13] <+ratreborn> these guy are SICK
[1:02:15] <$vampireinarm> watch out for their self destruct
[1:02:16] <$jamarartdoodles> Yee
[1:02:22] <$vampireinarm> it deals a ton of damage
[1:02:29] <+GreenCMD> that's a straight up Gundam design wow
[1:02:31] <sad_toast_> indeed neat designs
[1:02:33] <tokenreefer> oh they are but fun-ish
[1:02:33] <+HawkGoggles2> Mech suits are pretty cool.
[1:02:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah they kept the roller skates!
[1:02:39] <SuperVaderMan> Lookit him go LUL
[1:02:44] <+stephentoostronk> they kept the slender guy inside!?
[1:02:50] <thecrazyanbu> The guy has rollerblades
[1:02:53] <$vampireinarm> did plague never get the mythril saber?
[1:02:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> he did
[1:03:01] <Sokumotanaka> That dude literally JUST input read you
[1:03:06] <+Neoripo> Running around at the speed of sound!
[1:03:13] <sad_toast_> awww yes roller blading assassin's
[1:03:19] <+ratreborn> Mythril Saber sucks for C-Loud
[1:03:26] <+ratreborn> who uses magic on Cloud
[1:03:26] <+firmlygraspi1> EVERYBODY JUMP
[1:03:29] <tokenreefer> got places to go!
[1:03:32] <GiygasDrillBreak> shame, mithril saber so aesthetic
[1:03:39] <+ratreborn> it looks great
[1:03:44] <+ratreborn> bad weapon for Cloud
[1:03:53] <terminusterminal> He was more dangerous skating around than he was in the armor
[1:03:56] <sad_toast_> 😅🤣👌
[1:03:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> cuz magic sucks in this game? yeah
[1:04:09] <+ratreborn> nah Magic is OP
[1:04:18] <tokenreefer> yea magic is good
[1:04:18] <$vampireinarm> mythril saber carried me through the final 2 boss fights, at least the ability it gives
[1:04:24] <+ratreborn> Thundaga melts anything
[1:04:33] <$vampireinarm> if you do it point blank with high magic statit melts ANYTHING
[1:04:43] <tokenreefer> buster sword elemental materia
[1:04:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> well that would be helpful right now
[1:05:01] <sad_toast_> "F you I'm fabulous" lol skater bois
[1:05:02] <examplez0> Cloud begins third wheeling right now
[1:05:14] <tokenreefer> magnify + barrier
[1:05:20] <sad_toast_> Suddenly Red 13
[1:05:20] <+Neoripo> I am sorry plague for what is to come
[1:05:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah... red xiii doesnt make sense for... a while, for some reason we'll never know
[1:05:33] <NineBall3D> lol
[1:05:35] <tokenreefer> the worst is coming
[1:05:41] <examplez0> Time ghosts are no big deal
[1:05:41] <+firmlygraspi1> Don't let that thing on the couch!
[1:05:47] <+GreenCMD> we'll cats were the only normal animal in the slums
[1:05:51] <examplez0> But a talking lion dog whoa that's messed up
[1:05:52] <TheWe4pon> aight so is the weapon in this are?
[1:05:55] <TheWe4pon> area
[1:05:56] <$vampireinarm> so how do you get more limit breaks? i never got any through my whole playthrough
[1:06:03] <+CrimsonDio11> plague I highly suggest taking the time to add materia to Aerith now
[1:06:03] <Sokumotanaka> To be fair after seeing everything attack you in this place the one animal that does and runs makes you wuestion thingd
[1:06:05] <+ratreborn> Colloseum
[1:06:27] <+ratreborn> they kinda hide it from u after u get one though
[1:06:32] <tokenreefer> time to swap materia constantly
[1:06:35] <$vampireinarm> oh yeah you want all 4 of them well equipped for the upcoming stuff
[1:06:39] <realitywinnerz> how far into the game are we?
[1:06:40] <+ratreborn> forgot i add the 2nd Cloud Limit cause i never went into the Battle Settings
[1:06:42] <+Neoripo> People say the ending is the problem. And it's ludicrous, don't get me wrong. But to me the worst part of the game is the next section
[1:07:11] <+ratreborn> yeah ill agree with that
[1:07:12] <tokenreefer> ff15 had the same problem
[1:07:14] <+ratreborn> its tedious
[1:07:32] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes to save you some heartache you should probably add materia to Aerith
[1:07:38] <gunsrlove> Despite kinda knowing things, I'm still hoping for Gackt
[1:07:39] <+Neoripo> yeah, chapter 13 i think
[1:07:44] <penitentpentwitch> The next part is a bit rough since you have to 'play as everyone'. So if you don't have materia on everyone, its sucks.
[1:07:47] <gunsrlove> just for shits
[1:07:50] <CursedNobleman> ooh, business jargon materia
[1:08:06] <+ratreborn> Genesis will come back, hopefully not with Gackt attached
[1:08:19] <+ratreborn> hes the reason we wont ever get a HD ver of Crisis Core
[1:08:21] <CursedNobleman> Synergy materia facilitates quality impact through coordinated leveraging of coworker efforts.
[1:08:26] <examplez0> No thanks, we don't need Genesis again ever
[1:08:31] <examplez0> Even once was too much
[1:08:39] <+ratreborn> too bad
[1:08:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> it aint quality cuz Synergy costs ATB and MP
[1:08:42] <+ratreborn> hes coming back
[1:08:43] <+Neoripo> Plague, stuff ALL slots full of materia
[1:08:44] <ahaegotrigger> NICE
[1:08:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> and it wont cast a higher level spell
[1:08:49] <+ratreborn> plus Dirge is canon too
[1:08:55] <examplez0> Roche will replace Genesis anyway
[1:09:01] <+ratreborn> i wish
[1:09:03] <+ratreborn> Roche is cool
[1:09:13] <sad_toast_> "it will make her waste ATB" ... leaves it equiped? 🤔
[1:09:14] <+GreenCMD> I swear synergy must have been a leftover from the CC2 build of the game. It doesn't fit this current system at all.
[1:09:14] <+Neoripo> It's a LAZY materia
[1:09:14] <Explodincatz> was it in the old game?
[1:09:15] <arran_throttle> Genesis better then Sap Kappa
[1:09:19] <+Neoripo> no
[1:09:39] <tokenreefer> materia did not function the same way
[1:09:43] <Explodincatz> must have been a quota thing
[1:09:47] <+Neoripo> Things like ATB up and the like did not exist
[1:09:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> Synergy is like being told "buy 1 get 1 free" but it turns out it's just "buy 1 then another 1"
[1:09:59] <TheWe4pon> remember when mime was a thing?
[1:09:59] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes you should equip materia to Aerith
[1:10:07] <+ratreborn> oh wow hes got quite a bit of maxed materia
[1:10:12] <+Neoripo> And Magnify was ALL materia, to target everyone
[1:10:41] <+Neoripo> yes
[1:10:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's alot in this game from the CC2 alpha
[1:10:46] <$vampireinarm> how long are you planning on going tonight ?
[1:10:53] <tokenreefer> hes going to get frustrated swapping materia
[1:10:57] <CursedNobleman> go for the eyes boo
[1:11:13] <Kejang> nanaki gotta nut
[1:11:14] <arkv01> yeah in the original red was chewing out hojos neck
[1:11:19] <gunsrlove> Guh, uhhh, mouth breathing
[1:11:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> CC2 made all the dotHACK games, that was originally who was making this game, and they got fired
[1:11:29] <sad_toast_> and Red 13 is just your pal now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[1:11:31] <examplez0> We include him but we'll explain absolutely nothing about him
[1:11:34] <+Neoripo> Yeah, that was a very dumb statement
[1:11:35] <examplez0> Thanks Nomura
[1:11:39] <$vampireinarm> trying to keep sephiroth a secret would be some dumb shit
[1:11:42] <tokenreefer> sephorith didnt T pose though
[1:11:43] <TheWe4pon> brainwashing!
[1:11:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> did she cure his BERSERK?
[1:11:56] <kingra> He now KNOWS what happens
[1:12:05] <CursedNobleman> quality ear waggles
[1:12:11] <CursedNobleman> he can talk!
[1:12:12] <+Neoripo> Aerith transmiting info
[1:12:13] <+whiskywolfe> Red always knew he was never going to attack Aeris - why did they have her do that to him.
[1:12:16] <sad_toast_> I do like his design 😏
[1:12:17] <%Samex_Comex> It's Charmander!
[1:12:21] <arkv01> but that tail tho
[1:12:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> wow it's like he's really an edgy 14 year old
[1:12:23] <+spacehouse> A Talking Dog Best friend
[1:12:25] <arkv01> EXPLAIN YOUR TAIL RED
[1:12:28] <Sokumotanaka> and that tail too
[1:12:28] <Explodincatz> dude his voice is so swave
[1:12:34] <tokenreefer> aerith casts charm
[1:12:35] <+ratreborn> theres the pose
[1:12:36] <gunsrlove> his mane looks dumb
[1:12:38] <$vampireinarm> theres a few potato textures in the game
[1:12:41] <NineBall3D> TIFA WANT DAT KNOT
[1:12:44] <sad_toast_> he's like "I'm a cat dog thing... deal with it 😎"
[1:12:52] <KaiserMario> ORGANIZATION XIII??
[1:12:53] <$vampireinarm> ive seen the pictures
[1:12:56] <GiygasDrillBreak> also they totally didnt mocap a dog for him, and it shows
[1:13:05] <examplez0> What did his mother look like?
[1:13:11] <arkv01> mah grandpappy always taught me to wrap it up
[1:13:15] <+whiskywolfe> No he IS the ball.
[1:13:19] <tokenreefer> mother....
[1:13:29] <$vampireinarm> Do you think were gonna get Hojo on the beach in the next part? or aws it someone else?
[1:13:33] <tokenreefer> jen...o...va...
[1:13:36] <+Neoripo> I bet the ball will be antigravity moped
[1:13:37] <doggieo> Will there be a jail scene I wonder
[1:13:41] <CursedNobleman> microwave corridor!
[1:13:42] <+firmlygraspi1> MGS4 oven room?
[1:13:47] <penitentpentwitch> Another 'microwave corridor' scene
[1:13:56] <%Samex_Comex> Cloud is a robot!?
[1:13:56] <CursedNobleman> oooooooooooh, semeeeeeeeeeee @firmlygraspi1
[1:14:03] <CursedNobleman> *Japanese warbling*
[1:14:09] <tokenreefer> mother....
[1:14:15] <+ratreborn> this part is actually masterfully crafted
[1:14:19] <gunsrlove> Ga - cku- to choooir raaaaaah daaaaah
[1:14:20] <+ratreborn> the filter
[1:14:22] <kingra> Yep
[1:14:24] <sad_toast_> hmmmmuther
[1:14:25] <+ratreborn> the dumb walk
[1:14:27] <+Neoripo> Actually Latin
[1:14:32] <$vampireinarm> MUdeeer
[1:14:33] <+whiskywolfe> Look at how important this plot device character is
[1:14:34] <+some_brave_apollo> lel
[1:14:34] <arkv01> this is fanservice sephiroth
[1:14:35] <examplez0> I'd give him a 2
[1:14:38] <kingra> He's fanfiction Sephiroth
[1:14:46] <examplez0> He's Nomura's wet dream
[1:14:46] <sad_toast_> anime man...
[1:14:50] <Huntercd> Why should we care about him?
[1:14:50] <tokenreefer> sephiroth with bde
[1:14:52] <+stephentoostronk> it's not the real sephiroth, just the one in cloud's head
[1:14:58] <arkv01> damn jenova you got some curves guuuurl
[1:15:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> Sephiroth is not a real character, though, he never was. he was bland until he finds out his life was a lie and, understandably, goes genocidal
[1:15:04] <CursedNobleman> show bobs
[1:15:13] <examplez0> Everyone was just standing there
[1:15:26] <Sokumotanaka> Wow completely shat on nanaki's introduction
[1:15:31] <sad_toast_> 🤔😏
[1:15:35] <tokenreefer> aeriths fantasy
[1:15:36] <$vampireinarm> genocide gets you vacation day in the turks
[1:15:45] <Explodincatz> i still dont know
[1:15:46] <mrgaster8> LET GOOO
[1:15:47] <arkv01> sepha who? rogan?
[1:15:56] <tokenreefer> 6ft long SWORD
[1:16:08] <CursedNobleman> yeah no.
[1:16:16] <mrgaster8> bad man
[1:16:17] <Huntercd> They are still scumbags
[1:16:18] <+some_brave_apollo> what is pacing?
[1:16:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> to date, there is no explanation why Sephiroth has a 6 foot katana
[1:16:28] <examplez0> Rude looks like my dad
[1:16:30] <+ratreborn> does it matter?
[1:16:33] <+Neoripo> There is a theory of why Sephy is characterized the way he is. But it will make you Plague go genocidal
[1:16:33] <$vampireinarm> they turned sector 7 into car fuel and electricity for their lamps
[1:16:41] <gunsrlove> Washing Pole dex spammer
[1:16:42] <tokenreefer> BIG **** ENERGY
[1:16:44] <+spacehouse> Makes sense for Kotor2
[1:16:45] <arkv01> rufus planning behind the scenes
[1:17:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> they keep Seph a blank slate because he's a husbando to japanese consoomers
[1:17:10] <SuperVaderMan> OhMyDog
[1:17:10] <arkv01> oh wow
[1:17:18] <jo_vo> "Nani?"
[1:17:18] <penitentpentwitch> So was 'JENOVA' humanoid, or was it implied the body is some Cetra that absorbed the 'most JENOVA'?
[1:17:19] <$vampireinarm> her prison cell
[1:17:19] <%Samex_Comex> A RE save room
[1:17:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> Jenova was a Lavos
[1:17:28] <+stephentoostronk> wasnt she in icicle inn when she was born?
[1:17:29] <$vampireinarm> you CANT miss the weapon here
[1:17:29] <tokenreefer> my mother watched me destroy our room
[1:17:29] <Huntercd> So that's why the younglings died
[1:17:30] <arkv01> oh right, when she was with ifalna
[1:17:31] <terminusterminal> Damn the Hard Edge don't look too good
[1:17:32] <+ratreborn> Jenova was a calamity
[1:17:33] <ScreamLord> And for some reason Shinra never touched this room
[1:17:51] <arkv01> the hard edge had a hard life
[1:17:53] <mrgaster8> i find this cool tho
[1:17:57] <KaiserMario> Oh look, she's Rapunzel... daaawwww
[1:17:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> why would they, they knew she was coming back, lol
[1:18:02] <sad_toast_> yep Red is just suddenly their new friend now like whatever ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[1:18:10] <%CyberDingus> "Shut up tits!
[1:18:25] <StromkoPenguin> The gang always wanted a talking dogcat
[1:18:30] <Explodincatz> this whole losing party members is stupid to have for a video game
[1:18:58] <Explodincatz> combo'd with having points of no return
[1:18:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> dang i forgot Gast
[1:19:10] <tokenreefer> max level? dang dude
[1:19:39] <+Neoripo> Who wouldn't flee from Hojo's creep aura?
[1:19:44] <$vampireinarm> she was Child years old
[1:19:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> Elmyra's flashback was 15 years before present, so Aeris would have been 6
[1:20:03] <Maids4lyfe> kitty-dog
[1:20:05] <mrgaster8> 7 around thier
[1:20:06] <Huntercd> How did Ifana survive the world ending enough tho
[1:20:08] <+Neoripo> Oh boy
[1:20:09] <+machina777> Good sassy boy
[1:20:09] <%Samex_Comex> Do you need the whole couch Barret

[1:20:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> Red XIII is the Larsa of this game
[1:20:33] <mrgaster8> nooo
[1:20:35] <sad_toast_> Youll see 🤭
[1:20:35] <Sokumotanaka> How do you people think it's a dog? I see a female lion made into a male
[1:20:45] <arkv01> she could levitate when she was younger, like all children
[1:20:45] <+Neoripo> Plague is going to be so happy with the revelaiatons
[1:20:46] <+ratreborn> its neither'
[1:20:48] <examplez0> The power of the ancients
[1:20:48] <Maids4lyfe> children can climb Plague
[1:20:49] <Explodincatz> dont worry about it
[1:20:49] <penitentpentwitch> I'm worried they'll make the other 'side characters' will get the same treatment in the future
[1:20:49] <+firmlygraspi1> jetpack
[1:20:49] <robobro333> you look like broden from aunty donna
[1:20:51] <sosandstorm> ladders though
[1:20:52] <$vampireinarm> its a dog cat thing
[1:20:56] <$vampireinarm> malnourished as fuck
[1:20:59] <+HawkGoggles2> With the power of magic. Kappa
[1:21:00] <troytaco1> there is a ladder to the left ;3
[1:21:02] <sosandstorm> there could have once been one
[1:21:05] <don_fluffle> On the shoulders of giants
[1:21:06] <Maids4lyfe> children can climb when you're not looking
[1:21:07] <Zulrez> figured her mother drew it for her
[1:21:07] <%Samex_Comex> With her one wing
[1:21:08] <+GreenCMD> there is a small one
[1:21:13] <Maids4lyfe> that's how they hurt themselves
[1:21:16] <terminusterminal> She grew one wing
[1:21:16] <arkv01> she paid shinra grunts in exposure to draw it for her
[1:21:17] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes there is a latter you literally stared at it for a second
[1:21:19] <xeros720> saw a stepladder, yeah
[1:21:25] <$vampireinarm> plague theres a ladder to the left
[1:21:26] <penitentpentwitch> Temple of the ancients in the top left corner
[1:21:29] <gunsrlove> They needed the ladder for something else
[1:21:31] <sad_toast_> should have a rollie library ladder 🤔
[1:21:32] <locobo98> aeris has one wing?
[1:21:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's too short for a 6 year old girl
[1:21:34] <$jamarartdoodles> Tangled FF7
[1:21:50] <tokenreefer> its the latter
[1:21:55] <sad_toast_> latter 😒
[1:22:05] <examplez0> Impressive she was able to climb a smooth vertical surface
[1:22:08] <+ratreborn> its Loo-kret-sia
[1:22:08] <Maids4lyfe> you forget being children yourselves y'all
[1:22:10] <locobo98> church of ladder day saints
[1:22:11] <+CrimsonDio11> my bad I cant spell sometimes lol
[1:22:20] <xeros720> there's some other rooms for subjects outside this one too, this one is bigger tho, for no real reason
[1:22:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> there IS a church, ya know
[1:22:25] <locobo98> its the bibble

[1:22:35] <arkv01> pastor barret
[1:22:39] <tokenreefer> the bible is fairy tales
[1:22:42] <penitentpentwitch> I always assumed the Cetra meant 'The Lifestream' when they referred to paradise
[1:22:53] <ahaegotrigger> True
[1:23:00] <mrgaster8> @Maids4lyfe hahah

[1:24:09] <%bettysharkface> Oh my fucking god
[1:24:11] <gensoukaizou> ah yes I completely understand
[1:24:13] <+UnwoundCaesar70> They read the script
[1:24:15] <SuperVaderMan> "Holy shit, did that dog just talk"
[1:24:15] <CursedNobleman> red the magical injun
[1:24:19] <+HawkGoggles2> Is the meta narrative not obvious enough. Fuck, let me explain it.
[1:24:20] <Zinax7> like capital d double d?
[1:24:21] <JoeBecomesJoe> Good boy
[1:24:21] <Kejang> visions of lightning
[1:24:21] <terminusterminal> I think I hate this.
[1:24:24] <rib64> someone tell mufasa to stfu
[1:24:28] <oniwahoo> What the fuck is this?! lol
[1:24:29] <%bettysharkface> Oh my god
[1:24:30] <sad_toast_> FATE .. Destiny!!? buzzwords!! Nomura!!
[1:24:30] <Explodincatz> this is stupid
[1:24:33] <%bettysharkface> This is stupud
[1:24:34] <tokenreefer> destiny with the D***?
[1:24:39] <arkv01> nomura posessing red exorcist style
[1:24:40] <%Samex_Comex> Namora is the planet?
[1:24:41] <gunsrlove> Gackt is Desitny , he sends his idol ghosts
[1:24:41] <Huntercd> Time travel is dumb
[1:24:44] <Mexrage> that's Nojima, not nomura
[1:24:45] <sosandstorm> Tellem Barret
[1:24:50] <+some_brave_apollo> The sad thing is it's not just Nomura, this is just how Squeenix is
[1:24:52] <sad_toast_> 🤣
[1:24:53] <xeros720> rare moment of plot lucidity
[1:24:56] <+spacehouse> No, Youre ADORABLE
[1:24:57] <penitentpentwitch> Plot-ergeists.
[1:24:59] <terminusterminal> You fucking what?
[1:25:02] <oniwahoo> WOW
[1:25:09] <jggoryl> the hell does that even mean
[1:25:11] <examplez0> Bravo Nomumbo
[1:25:13] <rib64> LUL
[1:25:14] <Kejang> bruh i just know shit
[1:25:18] <xeros720> "fuckin lifestream, i dunno"
[1:25:21] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:25:26] <arkv01> nomura's been waiting 20 years to nut in our faces like this
[1:25:26] <+HawkGoggles2> It's a good reflection effect tho.
[1:25:28] <mrgaster8> i love this
[1:25:30] <GiygasDrillBreak> lifestream lesson: remake something after its creator died
[1:25:32] <majeser> they're just hanging out in the background lol
[1:25:33] <oniwahoo> I just magically know, bitches
[1:25:36] <+GreenCMD> source: this was revealed to me in a dream.
[1:25:36] <locobo98> cloud looks like such a babydace
[1:25:41] <examplez0> Noooo it wasn't Nomura's fault it was all Nojima not Nomura he's a good boy who dindu nuffin
[1:25:46] <Zinax7> i get excited
[1:25:48] <sad_toast_> Nomura bottles his own Farts to smell later...
[1:25:50] <arkv01> this is full anime
[1:25:51] <rib64> "these thirsty bois"
[1:25:53] <tokenreefer> the ending is so ridiculous
[1:25:53] <CursedNobleman> Planescape Shadows! LUL
[1:25:58] <Explodincatz> the ghosts show her the script
[1:26:00] <%Samex_Comex> Ring around the rosie
[1:26:01] <StaticEntry> oh its going alright
[1:26:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura is the artist with no self-doubt
[1:26:07] <SuperVaderMan> Nomura just full-on masturbating
[1:26:07] <sosandstorm> WHAT
[1:26:10] <Huntercd> This is stupid
[1:26:11] <oniwahoo> Aeris has Meta knowledge
[1:26:14] <%bettysharkface> Whar
[1:26:14] <arkv01> uh tifa is STRONG
[1:26:15] <sosandstorm> wait you can just DO that?
[1:26:16] <+ratreborn> im glad we're getting new shit
[1:26:22] <%bettysharkface> What the fuck
[1:26:22] <rib64> tifa knows how to handle thirsty bois
[1:26:23] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes These Time Ghost are literally Nomura's stand in for the FF7 fanbase SCREAMING at him "Not Canon!"
[1:26:24] <xeros720> he really needs editors
[1:26:28] <arran_throttle> so basicly - Wispers are DM's from DnD?
[1:26:30] <MKUltima> Nomura got Kojima'd
[1:26:32] <danielm427> filler
[1:26:36] <CursedNobleman> Jerking off the nomura dick with energy arms LUL
[1:26:37] <examplez0> Every scene where a character grabs another character's hand has been a Nomura scene
[1:26:37] <+spacehouse> isn't that basically all JRPG stories?
[1:26:38] <tokenreefer> numora went full kojima
[1:26:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> We need to link this to Kingdom Hearts
[1:26:42] <+some_brave_apollo> the timeline ghosts don't even look good, either. Totally uninspired design
[1:26:45] <rib64> *nah nah nah*
[1:26:48] <+Neoripo> Follow destiny or fight against it is what it's saying
[1:26:58] <sosandstorm> @arran_throttle shitty DMs maybe
[1:27:01] <oniwahoo> Ah yes, the man on the inside
[1:27:06] <TheWe4pon> fuck off
[1:27:07] <%Samex_Comex> Yay Wedge is back!
[1:27:10] <BillieNoMates> Wedge just solo'd Shinraa
[1:27:11] <gunsrlove> GHOSTS KILL HIM NOW
[1:27:13] <+spacehouse> Where's all the time ghosts now?
[1:27:13] <majeser> we smelled the food court
[1:27:14] <BillieNoMates> What an absolute unit
[1:27:16] <SuperVaderMan> Wedge eats food 4Head
[1:27:16] <terminusterminal> Seriously with the Time Ghosts around why isn't Wedge dead?
[1:27:17] <tokenreefer> eyes on the inside
[1:27:18] <sosuke5> SeemsGood
[1:27:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> you fell 70 feet, Wedge, you should be dead
[1:27:22] <penitentpentwitch> Wedge is going to bait all the Plot Ghosts
[1:27:27] <JoeBecomesJoe> Haha, hes fat. Good character
[1:27:31] <rib64> "maybe you should have planted bombs somewhere and dropped the lisp"
[1:27:32] <sosuke5> HE'S FAT, GET IT
[1:27:34] <xeros720> @spacehouse i mean yeah, but you don't see floating stagehands physically moving stuff for DESTINY
[1:27:48] <xeros720> until now, that is
[1:28:06] <MartiusGW> nomura knows better
[1:28:11] <Explodincatz> not anymore
[1:28:12] <IntrepidEye> shut up tho
[1:28:14] <thecrazyanbu> Fatty's gonna die of a heart attack now
[1:28:15] <Hasuke> Oh no a ghost induced heart attack
[1:28:20] <+Saggitori> they are now baybee
[1:28:20] <gensoukaizou> how else will they tie wutai in
[1:28:33] <ahaegotrigger> Hell Yeah
[1:28:37] <%Samex_Comex> I love being strong
[1:28:39] <rib64> brony energy?
[1:28:40] <MartiusGW> i like that flower in back
[1:28:40] <sad_toast_> lol @intrepideye yeah... but.. shut up tho lolol
[1:28:41] <penitentpentwitch> Rainbow Horse?
[1:28:43] <Maids4lyfe> jenova horse
[1:28:44] <+spacehouse> wearing clothes like a hussy
[1:28:45] <GiygasDrillBreak> the horse is Kujata
[1:28:45] <BillieNoMates> Aeris was an MLP fan
[1:28:46] <examplez0> It's been farting rainbows
[1:28:46] <ahaegotrigger> I LOVE BEING STRONG
[1:28:47] <Zinax7> wasn't it real in ff7 before crisis?
[1:28:50] <CursedNobleman> its a fairy horse.
[1:28:50] <StaticEntry> chimera horse?
[1:28:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Secret Summon
[1:28:50] <Huntercd> Four people plus Barret
[1:28:51] <sosuke5> I bet Data drew that horse.
[1:28:53] <$vampireinarm> early in the game they called themselves a cell of avalanche, so at least they tried to cover their ass storywise
[1:28:58] <penitentpentwitch> Temple of the Ancients in the top left
[1:29:01] <rib64> hippy shit
[1:29:01] <tokenreefer> you like shoehorns? cause we shoehorned your shoehorn
[1:29:02] <+Neoripo> Plague only believes in the old scriptures
[1:29:10] <examplez0> Okay those two stags are actually really nice looking
[1:29:11] <gunsrlove> They took drugs, had some visions, wanted to become one with the planet
[1:29:15] <arkv01> so summons are just aeris' OCs?
[1:29:26] <sad_toast_> she's a prisoner but they give her all this lead based paint 🤔
[1:29:28] <+Saggitori> @plagueofgripes do you call guts gattsu
[1:29:28] <penitentpentwitch> Put materia on everyone, you'll be using everyone next section
[1:29:36] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:29:57] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Populate ALL the slots
[1:30:09] <$vampireinarm> the game is gonna do this a lot coming up, you want all 4 of them fully equipped since itll do it mid battle and you wont be able to rearrange materia
[1:30:10] <IntrepidEye> I probably should check out this compilation shit so I'm more in the loop but I really don't want to. A lot of it sounds terrible
[1:30:26] <BillieNoMates> Because CONSOOM is the norm
[1:30:28] <Futurecity10> dont forget RE3
[1:30:40] <locobo98> hopefully people will learn that making a new thing isnt bad
[1:30:43] <arkv01> this is still leagues better than picard or STD LUL
[1:30:46] <+ratreborn> RE3 was missing shit, not adding new shit
[1:30:49] <BillieNoMates> and all of media since copyright became a thing is "well I could write this but I think this would be cooler"
[1:30:51] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF13 was bad, though
[1:31:00] <+Saggitori> probably because the directors didn't want to make the same damn thing
[1:31:02] <penitentpentwitch> FF15 was a money sink
[1:31:12] <xeros720> a lot of extended ff7 stuff was real bad too, this isn't the worst offender
[1:31:19] <penitentpentwitch> You'll be using everyone, equip all materia
[1:31:21] <+Neoripo> I prefer that they remake FF7 that another 13
[1:31:46] <tokenreefer> ff7 has the same problem of ff15. last 3rd is doo doo
[1:31:49] <TheWe4pon> any chance of Normura getting a heartattack and dying before 2?
[1:31:50] <$vampireinarm> you want all 4 of them equipped or youre gonna get wrecked later
[1:32:07] <Sokumotanaka> I keep saying the problem with new ff games besdies nomura is that the ff13 team are the new heads of the company so it's gonna be bad for a while
[1:32:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> SE is learnding, FF7R isn't as bad as FF15, and nowhere as bad as FF13, there wont be an FF16 for a looooong time
[1:32:08] <Maids4lyfe> 2 is already almost finished
[1:32:09] <+ratreborn> was literally a 4 hours game
[1:32:10] <BillieNoMates> Because it wasn't anywhere as good as RE2make
[1:32:11] <Explodincatz> did anyone ever?
[1:32:12] <+ratreborn> no one cares
[1:32:17] <examplez0> @xeros720 Yeah I mean this is still better written and directed than Advent Children but that's only a testament to who irredeemably awful AC is
[1:32:20] <BillieNoMates> Plus RE2 was always a bigger fanbase
[1:32:21] <+spacehouse> Cuz it's less of everything
[1:32:24] <+HawkGoggles2> FF7 cam in real quick, I can't blame RE3 for that.
[1:32:28] <sosandstorm> RE2 had a whole meme economy
[1:32:33] <sad_toast_> it's cuz it wasn't that great
[1:32:36] <terminusterminal> Seriously might wanna equip materia on everyone
[1:32:38] <+Saggitori> ff16 is new kingdom hearts
[1:32:43] <xeros720> you're right as well, it could be better
[1:32:44] <Explodincatz> ive only heard people loving RE4 and thats pretty much it
[1:32:58] <IntrepidEye> I'm conflicted. While I can't wait for part 2 I'm not sure that I want FF7 to be all the Final Fantasy we're likely to get for the next 10 years
[1:32:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> There is a reason there is Remake in this game's title
[1:33:05] <sad_toast_> RE4 is a classic 👌
[1:33:06] <examplez0> Hot take: RE4 is the best one and the only one that holds up today
[1:33:07] <%Samex_Comex> He smells like hot pockets
[1:33:15] <+ratreborn> RE3 literally feels like RE2 DLC
[1:33:16] <Hasuke> It's a Universal Studios ride for RE
[1:33:20] <ScreamLord> the FF13 games were just an excuse for Motomu Toriyama to jack off to Lightning
[1:33:26] <GiygasDrillBreak> good news, by the time they move on FF7 Remake, one of the directors will be dead
[1:33:28] <BillieNoMates> Well they did develop both at the same time
[1:33:28] <+Neoripo> RE3 didn't even attept to remake
[1:33:30] <jbrachob> RE4 test demo
[1:33:30] <+ratreborn> its good but not worth the price
[1:33:34] <xeros720> i agree with that, re2 dlc
[1:33:37] <penitentpentwitch> RE3 is 'filler' until RE4 and RE8.
[1:33:41] <Sokumotanaka> there goes scooby and the gang
[1:33:42] <+firmlygraspi1> sounds like a faithful remake to me
[1:33:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura is already over 50
[1:33:48] <sad_toast_> mediocre mid grade
[1:33:52] <tokenreefer> re4 remake is goi ng to suck
[1:33:54] <arkv01> hes the smelly boi
[1:34:04] <NineBall3D> re5 cause sheva is too hawt Kreygasm
[1:34:05] <Explodincatz> Ridley?!?
[1:34:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> wait, 49, close though
[1:34:10] <examplez0> Oh boy more experiments
[1:34:12] <sad_toast_> Red 13 "Everything is smelly..."
[1:34:14] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[1:34:16] <+ratreborn> Unreal Asset monsters
[1:34:17] <SuperVaderMan> So they just never acknowledge Red, he's just part of the group now
[1:34:21] <Explodincatz> the ultimate jobbers
[1:34:26] <+stephentoostronk> sephiroth failures?
[1:34:26] <arkv01> their nomura enemies
[1:34:26] <GiygasDrillBreak> ah their wings are on their left, that means they're from Genesis
[1:34:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I mean the original RE3 was kinda the same thing, just another rushed installment after a succesful one
[1:34:27] <Huntercd> If RE2R was a 9 RE3R is an 8
[1:34:40] <sad_toast_> it's a Heartless Nobody!!!
[1:34:42] <+ratreborn> RE2 was a solid 8
[1:34:47] <xeros720> yeah, seph failures, they redid the design tho
[1:34:48] <+ratreborn> RE3 was a 7
[1:34:52] <+Saggitori> they look like chaos from sonic
[1:34:55] <kiwicoffin> When does the Norting begin
[1:34:58] <+ratreborn> maybe 6.5 cause the missing shit
[1:34:59] <IntrepidEye> so is that why they look like power ranger mooks
[1:35:04] <+Neoripo> Eh, i'll give them a pass. FF7 has some weird shit
[1:35:06] <BillieNoMates> Ahahaha
[1:35:09] <Explodincatz> hah
[1:35:15] <arkv01> cmon dawg, up high!
[1:35:19] <sad_toast_> no clock tower 😒
[1:35:20] <terminusterminal> Red hates black people.
[1:35:20] <BillieNoMates> Barret found his fursona and it hates him
[1:35:29] <gunsrlove> Considering the total Final Fantasy aesthetic , 15, 14, they could fit...It is a generic MMO-y monster enemy deisgn
[1:35:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Barrett goes out of his way to make friends with Doggo
[1:35:35] <StaticEntry> Too bad red isnt playable
[1:35:37] <+zo_fuutaku> zo_fuutaku subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:35:41] <+ratreborn> what if Barret had Big Smokes voice
[1:35:41] <xeros720> they were blue demon/gremlins in design before
[1:35:52] <arkv01> I mean this game was always linear in midgar, but the remake camera focus is atrocious
[1:35:56] <Medo3G> focus testing
[1:35:57] <examplez0> To force replayability
[1:36:01] <%zo_fuutaku> rooHappy
[1:36:03] <Explodincatz> its not a game its an experience
[1:36:05] <+HawkGoggles2> The game can only load so much.
[1:36:05] <+Neoripo> Yeah
[1:36:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's Unreal Engine, so the developers are incompetent
[1:36:09] <BillieNoMates> Its probably a loading method
[1:36:16] <NineBall3D> CONSOLE PROBLEMS
[1:36:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> also PS4 is a dinosaur
[1:36:26] <+Saggitori> definitely loading
[1:36:26] <IntrepidEye> I mean we are on decade old hardware.
[1:36:26] <sad_toast_> I don't think anyone gives Red head Pat's 😔
[1:36:29] <Kyni> It's very likely a loading issue
[1:36:29] <penitentpentwitch> It's a shortcut for processing power
[1:36:34] <xeros720> that makes sense, lets them preload next area
[1:36:39] <BillieNoMates> It normally happens after a cutscene and the PS4 is already dated
[1:36:46] <examplez0> And despite all that the game still looks crap for a 2020 PS4 game
[1:36:47] <+Neoripo> It's their second UE4 game, they may have run into problems
[1:36:52] <BillieNoMates> It's why Im shocked it didn't get a PS5 launch release
[1:36:56] <Sokumotanaka> @NineBall3D Sure lets start THAT flame war
[1:37:01] <+Neoripo> Or the testers where pretty dumb
[1:37:03] <BillieNoMates> It'd be a "good" reason to buy one
[1:37:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> PArt 2 will be PS5
[1:37:12] <+ratreborn> as much as i wish Red XIII was playable, it wouldnt make sense to develop it for the last 3 hours of the game
[1:37:16] <BillieNoMates> They said its all on PS4 I think
[1:37:19] <Liquid_In_Silico> 2nd game HAS to be open world like ff15. I'ma pissed if not
[1:37:21] <TheWe4pon> remember when they used to make there own engines?
[1:37:26] <Medo3G> I think it has decent asset streaming now
[1:37:27] <NineBall3D> @Sokumotanaka =]
[1:37:29] <tokenreefer> blacksona + fursona = plagueFace
[1:37:32] <+ratreborn> @Liquid_In_Silico why would u want that
[1:37:37] <gunsrlove> You can make anything, it's not really an engine limitation
[1:37:40] <+ratreborn> XV open world was empty
[1:37:43] <penitentpentwitch> I assume RE7R2 will be 'open world' a la FFX
[1:37:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> they're incompetent
[1:37:48] <+ratreborn> looked great but it was empty
[1:37:52] <+Neoripo> FF7 has a lot of unique models
[1:37:57] <BillieNoMates> I expect FFX style
[1:38:09] <+Neoripo> NO Plague
[1:38:13] <arkv01> yeah never again luminous
[1:38:15] <BillieNoMates> What engine did FFXV run on?
[1:38:17] <tokenreefer> engines are costly
[1:38:19] <GiygasDrillBreak> dont tell SE to get a new engine, they always changed engines each game until Luminous
[1:38:22] <Zinax7> it was linear on the original too, ( your average ff7 fan defense)
[1:38:23] <xeros720> get that kojima engine
[1:38:25] <Sokumotanaka> @NineBall3D XD
[1:38:26] <gunsrlove> Plus there is a graphic budget, can't have it look too good and be super open and run at decent fps on current consoles
[1:38:26] <Liquid_In_Silico> @ratreborn because FF7 had an open world as soon as you got out of Midgar? doesn't have to be MASSIVE
[1:38:29] <arkv01> you press the booton tiffies
[1:38:32] <+Neoripo> A new engine for SE means 5 more years of delays
[1:38:36] <Medo3G> it could be possibly due to story triggers as well
[1:38:40] <gunsrlove> At least that's what i think, Unreal is not that limited at all
[1:38:43] <penitentpentwitch> ELevator to Jenova
[1:38:48] <%Samex_Comex> gasp a feather
[1:38:52] <+ratreborn> im expecting a FF10 style open world
[1:38:58] <xeros720> yup, jenova big
[1:38:59] <examplez0> This is where the fun stops
[1:39:01] <+ratreborn> airship points
[1:39:07] <tokenreefer> its the same engine. its industry standard
[1:39:08] <MartiusGW> im expecting gumi ships
[1:39:10] <kiwicoffin> I like how Aerith touched Red and now he knows all the plot points
[1:39:11] <penitentpentwitch> Omnicharacter Marathon coming up, last chance to put Materia on everyone
[1:39:30] <Liquid_In_Silico> 12 style plain maps would be fine too I guess
[1:39:36] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah OG sephiroth made 0 appearance in Midgar
[1:39:37] <RedAhoge> Did ya hear about the castle super beast FF7 remake Anti retcon Ghost theory?
[1:39:39] <BillieNoMates> Well it wouldn't destroy it since Jenova's cells are in all SOLDIER and a bunch of randoms
[1:39:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Oh you're gonna fucking hate this filler section
[1:39:51] <arkv01> dark secret huh
[1:39:54] <RedAhoge> @plagueofgripes yes
[1:39:56] <+ratreborn> i wish they kept her old design
[1:39:58] <arkv01> her eye nipple
[1:40:02] <+ratreborn> looks to squigly
[1:40:02] <Sokumotanaka> Sephiroth died when cloud plunged him into the lifestream
[1:40:03] <tokenreefer> get ready for the pain train
[1:40:04] <SuperVaderMan> Free Jenova's nipple
[1:40:05] <+Neoripo> 1 eye nipple
[1:40:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> WHERE ITS DAMN HEAD THIS IS STUPID
[1:40:07] <xeros720> seph is hanging out in the lifestream at north crater too
[1:40:08] <+UnwoundCaesar70> The nipple that looked like an eye ball
[1:40:09] <tokenreefer> mother...
[1:40:09] <+HawkGoggles2> Censorship??!!! Kappa Kappa Kappa
[1:40:10] <+dawsfloss> Plague make your bed LUL
[1:40:13] <penitentpentwitch> An alien that looks humanoid
[1:40:14] <gunsrlove> Jehova\
[1:40:14] <jo_vo> Wasn't Jenova's nipple an eye?
[1:40:14] <MartiusGW> i mean, you could use jenova parts to spawn sepiroth from cloud?
[1:40:20] <arkv01> ! FANSERVICE !
[1:40:20] <mrgaster8> yeyeeeyey
[1:40:21] <BillieNoMates> He's pretty
[1:40:23] <RedAhoge> Eyeball nip
[1:40:26] <BillieNoMates> he has eye shadow too
[1:40:27] <Liquid_In_Silico> for kisses with mother
[1:40:28] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Inhismemoriesheisbeautiful
[1:40:36] <BillieNoMates> I dont think we'll get it
[1:40:39] <+spacehouse> Pretty much
[1:40:42] <sosandstorm> What
[1:40:44] <BillieNoMates> I expect it to be brushed over
[1:40:45] <arkv01> yeah, they gon did the kalm flashback dirty
[1:40:46] <jo_vo> Kalm flashback is going to be a recap of the story so far
[1:40:47] <shiny_prinny> if there still is a flashback
[1:40:49] <+ratreborn> wheres Jenovas puss puss at
[1:40:55] <Huntercd> Why does he have weird cat eyes?
[1:40:56] <gunsrlove> MOUTH BREATHING NOISES
[1:40:56] <+ratreborn> id hit it
[1:40:56] <gensoukaizou> it's...
[1:40:57] <examplez0> They completely ruined the mystique and buildup the original established so well
[1:40:58] <kingra> WHO???
[1:41:02] <jo_vo> 1 hour long cut scene
[1:41:03] <Explodincatz> i am that new player
[1:41:06] <+UnwoundCaesar70> No come on you know who Sephiroth is
[1:41:06] <+stephentoostronk> im still waiting to see how they do the dynamic music part "I'm going to see my mother"
[1:41:12] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He;s just the War Hero
[1:41:16] <+ratreborn> its in his head dude
[1:41:17] <Tikigod784> such a lust for revenge? WHOOOOOOOO
[1:41:19] <RedAhoge> Nnnyghn Muthurr
[1:41:22] <majeser> so the giant snake corpse scene isn't gonna be in the next game?
[1:41:26] <availablethor> @Explodincatz What's your opinion on the game?
[1:41:29] <MartiusGW> i guess remake is made for people like me who never played 7 but watched advent children
[1:41:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> did Sephiroth do this?
[1:41:35] <xeros720> one of the numbered clones is my guess
[1:41:37] <examplez0> Time traveler Sephiroth
[1:41:40] <+Neoripo> No
[1:41:40] <jo_vo> Holding that geostigma arm of his, huh?
[1:41:41] <%Samex_Comex> Christopher Lambert!?
[1:41:43] <Medo3G> eat shit
[1:41:43] <+ratreborn> no its not
[1:41:45] <mrgaster8> suck my cook
[1:41:47] <FessBC> this is Kingdom Hearts's Seth
[1:41:49] <+HawkGoggles2> He Said the thing!
[1:41:52] <+some_brave_apollo> he's a witcher
[1:41:52] <BillieNoMates> Because he was meant to be inhuman
[1:41:53] <+HawkGoggles2> Clap.
[1:41:53] <ScreamLord> Because evil
[1:41:54] <VroomSoon> he's a feisty feline
[1:41:54] <mrgaster8> cloud
[1:41:57] <Liquid_In_Silico> Byeeee
[1:41:58] <Maids4lyfe> because it looks evil
[1:41:58] <Tikigod784> cat eyes are spooky
[1:41:58] <penitentpentwitch> As long as Seph doesn't cast 'Sin Harvest'
[1:42:01] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> So how does Aerith know Jenova again? Just because?
[1:42:04] <jo_vo> Oh fuck outta here Hojo
[1:42:07] <tokenreefer> the cat to reds dog
[1:42:08] <Explodincatz> @availablethor a whore trying to suck everyone off at once
[1:42:09] <terminusterminal> They have cameras down there?
[1:42:18] <+ratreborn> its made for people who played FF7, and knows at least somewhat of whats going on in the compilation
[1:42:24] <examplez0> They have cameras but still can't catch AVALANCHE
[1:42:29] <Huntercd> He has not washed his hands
[1:42:29] <kiwicoffin> @fillmydarksoulwithlight I think the time ghosts whisper spoilers to Aerith
[1:42:39] <$vampireinarm> The Mayor is fucking with the cameras
[1:42:44] <penitentpentwitch> Isn't it implied the 'Arbiters of Fate' are dead Cetra talking to Aerith?
[1:42:56] <SuperVaderMan> better hurry :|
[1:42:58] <examplez0> Oh yeah I forgot lol
[1:43:05] <jo_vo> Because Sephiroth's washing pole cleaned house
[1:43:06] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes There ARE three Sephiroths! There's Lozz, Yazoo and Kadaj!
[1:43:09] <+spacehouse> Complete lie
[1:43:15] <arkv01> new fans be like what the fuck, but kingdom hearts fans fit right in
[1:43:27] <+ratreborn> i wouldnt recommend this to any new players
[1:43:32] <availablethor> @fillmydarksoulwithlight Sephiroth and Aeris are both know the metaplot here, for some reason. Plague haven't caught that though, Pat noticed it.
[1:43:36] <Explodincatz> very true
[1:43:37] <+ratreborn> its straight up a sequel
[1:43:39] <IntrepidEye> A lot of it doesn't make sense even if you did play 7
[1:43:40] <MartiusGW> but muh graphics
[1:43:40] <$vampireinarm> NEWBIES GET OUT REEEEE
[1:43:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> KH fans understand everything about this game already, didnt you get the memo
[1:43:47] <mrgaster8> RIP ME WHO did that
[1:43:48] <arkv01> I can confirm this with my younger bro, he loves KH and is having the time of his life with this
[1:43:48] <BillieNoMates> and thats their main market
[1:43:49] <Liquid_In_Silico> My SO enjoyed watching the story. Didn't care for the combat parts, she's never seen the orig game
[1:43:50] <Medo3G> this game which was released in 97
[1:43:50] <TheWe4pon> are those kolm pods and monsters?
[1:43:53] <Explodincatz> they keep moving to new set pieces way to fast
[1:43:54] <$jamarartdoodles> That or watch a lore of FF7 on youtube
[1:43:59] <xeros720> i'm rereading a lp of 7 to figure this shit out now and i played the og as well
[1:44:00] <BillieNoMates> Remember kids generally want to play Fortnite
[1:44:05] <+Saggitori> your the time ghost plague
[1:44:05] <jo_vo> Oh look, the monster pods
[1:44:07] <gunsrlove> Yes. hello, that's me. Never actually played any FF game LUL
[1:44:11] <BillieNoMates> Well you just walked over them with monsters in
[1:44:21] <$vampireinarm> Clouds final weapon is around here, The Drum Floor 3
[1:44:24] <KaiserMario> "But Plague... They made this for the fans..."
[1:44:28] <+Neoripo> So in the original, after saving Aeris, you go up, get captured by the turks, talk to shinra, get thrown into a cell, wake up with everyone DEAD and the jailcell open, then you go up, find president Shinra Impaled, fight Rufus, split into 2 and go down
[1:44:38] <RedAhoge> Muh Fetiah
[1:44:44] <arkv01> human mako batteries maybe
[1:44:44] <Dereh0g> So are all the fucking terrible compilation games canon now?
[1:44:48] <+ratreborn> the pods are packin Angeal clones
[1:44:50] <penitentpentwitch> It bathes living subjects with Mako
[1:44:53] <Maids4lyfe> science!
[1:44:56] <%JailShmixRemix> SCIENCE!
[1:44:57] <CursedNobleman> @penitentpentwitch correct.
[1:44:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah Hojo secretly put people in them when he wasnt supposed to
[1:45:02] <xeros720> hojo loves making monsters
[1:45:08] <kiwicoffin> what?
[1:45:10] <penitentpentwitch> Which is why they always show up in reactors
[1:45:14] <BillieNoMates> Drum Level 3
[1:45:16] <BillieNoMates> Not 4
[1:45:17] <tokenreefer> keep going. you're fine
[1:45:34] <ScreamLord> Hojo: What'll happen if I stick people in a pod full of Planet Soul Juice?
[1:45:35] <london_flexing> never played the original. But plot makes sense to me up until this point
[1:45:35] <RedAhoge> Monster girl goop
[1:45:37] <+ratreborn> this whole section is linear, id recommend rushing it
[1:45:41] <Huntercd> shits and iggles
[1:45:42] <NineBall3D> hojo took his pokemon fetish too far
[1:45:53] <tokenreefer> you'll get it later
[1:45:58] <mrgaster8> rush this bit
[1:46:04] <BillieNoMates> Beecause Avalanche attacked?
[1:46:04] <CursedNobleman> I just wanted my own mamono musume
[1:46:08] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes God bless your soul. Welcome to the WORST part of the game. May your soul be able to resist Hojo's funhouse
[1:46:16] <Liquid_In_Silico> sometimes shit happens
[1:46:23] <$vampireinarm> the avalanche attack
[1:46:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> is this chamber the literaly drum on the front of Shinra HQ?
[1:46:52] <xeros720> i assumed hojo just never cleans up his messes
[1:46:53] <penitentpentwitch> Filler, with mandatory participation by all characters
[1:46:53] <$vampireinarm> yeah this whole section is a drag
[1:47:02] <examplez0> It's just gone full Nomura now
[1:47:04] <arkv01> and the time ghosts getting an actual name
[1:47:11] <Liquid_In_Silico> the "worst" part
[1:47:13] <gnollAUS> Most likely wreaked by the large bridge that cat eyes just cut and let drop down into this area. That most likely did a bit of damage.
[1:47:13] <arkv01> back into your cage nomura
[1:47:21] <Zinax7> could one also attribute it to the localization too?
[1:47:28] <BillieNoMates> Doggo joins!
[1:47:33] <+shootbang_exe> I described it to a buddy as "Cloud passes out in chapter 16 and wakes up in a Nomura fanfic"
[1:47:46] <Zinax7> cuz there are some questionable decisions
[1:47:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> This ghost was great. I used to call him Little Jani Hotpockets I swear to god, he'd make your remake look like Kingdom Hearts, he was terrific, he was the best and he did it for a Sony exclusive too.
[1:47:51] <+Neoripo> I find this worst that the ending, because at least the gameplay is fun in the ending
[1:47:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> honestly no spoilers but i feel like this whole chapter just sucked for me
[1:47:52] <mrgaster8> take his full gurth
[1:48:16] <arkv01> if we can have red as a guest member, how about we get some johnny up in this bitch
[1:48:19] <FinalAce12> he will give them his red rocket
[1:48:27] <kiwicoffin> Remake is another word for fuck it
[1:48:32] <availablethor> I saw the ending as both very interesting and very insulting, depending on approach. Mixed feelings.
[1:48:36] <+stephentoostronk> Get your Kingdom Hearts out of my Final Fantasy
[1:48:51] <penitentpentwitch> Even the janitors fear this place, they fear they'll become part of his JENOVA impregnation fetish.
[1:48:57] <JoeBecomesJoe> Weird thing is he has a full moveset. Like can cast spells and do limits and everything
[1:49:08] <BillieNoMates> Everyone was on the bridge
[1:49:14] <+HawkGoggles2> Attack animation is all we got. Mechanics....? we spent that on Cait Sith's model.
[1:49:15] <BillieNoMates> and its Shinra quality
[1:49:19] <Liquid_In_Silico> when you're the only one here who enjoyed the ending of this game and is a fan of orig FF7 cyrHands
[1:49:26] <Sokumotanaka> Oh we found red
[1:49:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah well you'll fucking see
[1:49:38] <+ratreborn> the ending is a kino filter
[1:49:42] <arkv01> @JoeBecomesJoe I imagine they didn't have time to polish up his player controlled movement since he's a quadraped
[1:49:42] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:49:42] <availablethor> @Liquid_In_Silico I get you.
[1:49:44] <+Neoripo> They have to patch this game to either Add Red or streamline this section
[1:49:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah red is animated poorly
[1:49:59] <JoeBecomesJoe> @arkv01 You're probably right
[1:50:02] <tokenreefer> you'll notice it
[1:50:05] <Sokumotanaka> They never told us whar Red's race is called I hope they change that
[1:50:09] <penitentpentwitch> I enjoy stories that include elements in this ending, but they have to be build around those elements. Adding it afterward, makes in Fanfic-y.
[1:50:13] <TheWe4pon> @plagueofgripes after Barret is when you need to look
[1:50:32] <gunsrlove> LUL
[1:50:36] <arkv01> sephy go bishy bishy hahaha
[1:50:40] <+Neoripo> Actually no
[1:50:58] <gunsrlove> Sephiroth's deisgn always look goofy to me
[1:51:00] <xeros720> then he adorably jumps on the lever
[1:51:03] <kiwicoffin> You sense the Japanese boners tenting in their sailor suits as we speak
[1:51:29] <%JailShmixRemix> Sephy is so cool
[1:51:31] <+Neoripo> Sephiroth looked better low poly
[1:51:36] <arkv01> it's fine, tifa's weapon was just bikini armor and bare fists
[1:51:42] <JoeBecomesJoe> You miss purple pain too eh?
[1:51:51] <xeros720> he's a very good boy
[1:51:51] <Sokumotanaka> Does Red's race have rights or do people treat them like animals?
[1:51:52] <gunsrlove> Do cats count as goodbois?
[1:52:10] <gunsrlove> It's the Prometheus aliens!
[1:52:14] <+Neoripo> Hojo funtoys
[1:52:18] <suitangi021> Couldn't Cloud just grab the grating and shimmy across?
[1:52:19] <+firmlygraspi1> arent those the monsters from like 15 minutes ago?
[1:52:21] <penitentpentwitch> Hopefully Hojo's early comment about 'meeting the offspring of Aerith/Sephiroth' is not foreshadowing
[1:52:23] <+some_brave_apollo> aren't they the jenova monstermen like in the flashback
[1:52:40] <xeros720> they are
[1:52:40] <+Neoripo> It's basically FREE
[1:52:43] <mrgaster8> sweeet
[1:52:44] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:52:48] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You imagine how mad you'd be if they put a Keyblade in this game
[1:52:50] <xeros720> they just had a redesign
[1:52:55] <kiwicoffin> the unsung vending machine hero
[1:53:00] <arkv01> just slice the machine apart and take the stuff cloud
[1:53:03] <penitentpentwitch> You'd think with the constant discounts, there's something wrong with the 'taste' of those items
[1:53:09] <JoeBecomesJoe> Hojo does it, this is his gamer mini fridge
[1:53:10] <mrgaster8> its like free potions
[1:53:14] <availablethor> I bet it's Shinra Middle Manager
[1:53:21] <+terry_quest> you fought them befor
[1:53:27] <kiwicoffin> I think those are the experimental monsters
[1:53:28] <Kyni> I'm kinda curious where in the Shinra Building this whole Area is supposed to be.
[1:53:43] <tokenreefer> they're those guys
[1:53:45] <mrgaster8> aliens
[1:54:01] <penitentpentwitch> The Hojo's lab seems to vertically take up at least 4 floors of space.
[1:54:07] <arkv01> barret never drops kayfabe LUL
[1:54:18] <Explodincatz> camera plz
[1:54:27] <Sokumotanaka> Eyyyy red fights good
[1:54:34] <+Neoripo> Hojo's lab makes no sense
[1:54:44] <+terry_quest> also they are not aliens, look like but those are human experiments
[1:54:52] <tokenreefer> you can steal iron maiden from moth unit
[1:55:06] <xeros720> barret can wreck these at least
[1:55:27] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A lot of the enermies in the game get annoying, even if you put the time into grind out your weakness, Fuck you, immunity states
[1:55:41] <penitentpentwitch> The enemies sometimes have the 'Dyansty Warrior' mook problem of constantly circling you, doing nothing
[1:55:44] <+terry_quest> ohh boy he is in for a treat
[1:55:52] <xeros720> they really want you to magic
[1:56:04] <arkv01> it's more about how our attacks don't track like in KH and miss often cause they move all over the place
[1:56:20] <tokenreefer> you can steal from moth unit
[1:56:46] <%Samex_Comex> Wait what about X's in names?
[1:57:09] <xeros720> point blank?
[1:57:09] <$vampireinarm> plagueGripes_BN this was a good use of my channel points plagueGripes_BN
[1:57:18] <Explodincatz> like all FF games really\
[1:57:55] <tokenreefer> you can steal equips from that enemy
[1:58:00] <CursedNobleman> max is at the finale, bets up to see if hes gonna meltdown LUL
[1:58:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I feel like the roll is an illusion, you're suppose to take this damage, just block scrub
[1:58:09] <Sokumotanaka> BOYZ NIGHT
[1:58:27] <arkv01> max is gonna fellate this game no matter what at this point
[1:59:05] <TheWe4pon> don't know max much, he that kinda guy?
[1:59:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Max liked that Bike section,Max's fanboyism is marring his common sense
[1:59:16] <arkv01> "this nomura cum is good for my skin mmm yes"
[1:59:33] <%JailShmixRemix> Everyone is going to be that way
[1:59:34] <xeros720> looks like max just beat it, i'll have to watch his vod later
[1:59:39] <snowmanse> You put that image in my mind, and he was wearing a lightning cosplay.
[1:59:46] <penitentpentwitch> It really should have let you replay chapters the moment you finish it
[1:59:51] <%JailShmixRemix> The majority of people won't mind this game
[1:59:54] <FessBC> in original you were following bloodbath trail, can't have blood in new one
[2:00:01] <sosandstorm> is barrett equipped with stuff?
[2:00:21] <BillieNoMates> Remember to equip barry
[2:00:22] <arkv01> @JailShmixRemix this is true, the majority of people will have the gwaffix wool pulled over their eyes
[2:00:26] <availablethor> @FessBC that might ACTUALLY be the answer lol
[2:00:33] <locobo98> equip barret
[2:00:49] <penitentpentwitch> Counterstance counters magic too, I think?
[2:00:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Counterstance is better parry
[2:00:55] <+terry_quest> best ability
[2:00:57] <%JailShmixRemix> @arkv01 It's the sad truth
[2:00:57] <arkv01> it looks like an ffxiv weapon
[2:00:58] <+some_brave_apollo> that's a kingdom hearts sword
[2:00:58] <BillieNoMates> Its a superior parry
[2:01:31] <xeros720> it's a lot stronger and works on most things
[2:02:00] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah it's fucking dumb
[2:02:02] <penitentpentwitch> They're trying to make you equip everyone with materia
[2:02:02] <+ratreborn> comin up
[2:02:03] <+CrimsonDio11> Max just got to the ending and his chat is a warzone right now lol
[2:02:07] <tokenreefer> dont play plague like that
[2:02:16] <sosandstorm> yeah when Barrett and red were lifting the thing
[2:02:20] <Kyni> you had 1 fight with her whiel barret and red were lifting debris
[2:02:25] <BillieNoMates> You will be bouncing back and forth I imagine
[2:02:27] <tokenreefer> he gonna swith constantly
[2:02:28] <arkv01> dangling the aeris carrot
[2:02:34] <arkv01> you wan sum ancient? too bad!
[2:02:43] <gunsrlove> He's at it
[2:02:48] <gunsrlove> it is a big cry fest as expected
[2:02:53] <+HawkGoggles2> Max in on a honeymoon right now.
[2:02:54] <penitentpentwitch> Max is gushing
[2:02:55] <arkv01> max plays the game like he's super sponsored by squenix
[2:02:59] <xeros720> haha, nice way to put it
[2:03:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Max is in the final area, he;s heading into the final sequence
[2:03:10] <+CrimsonDio11> no he hasnt beaten it yet but he's about to start the final fight
[2:03:11] <gunsrlove> Yeah , Max is high on FF7 fumes rn
[2:03:17] <gunsrlove> and he does not seem very unhappy
[2:03:20] <Explodincatz> i dont expect him to be honest
[2:03:28] <StaticEntry> He's high right now
[2:03:31] <%Samex_Comex> He dose have a Cloud shrine
[2:03:35] <%JailShmixRemix> Maximillian handjobs?
[2:03:36] <arkv01> max is going to name his child an ff7 character soon
[2:03:44] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i mean hype is his business, being upset doesnt keep momentum
[2:03:47] <gunsrlove> I don't think his opinion can be dramatically swayed on FF7. he loves it too much
[2:03:57] <penitentpentwitch> I don't blame him for enjoying it, but a dirty pleasure can make you blind to its flaws
[2:03:58] <IntrepidEye> Its FF7. Non stop fellatio is to be expected regardless
[2:04:13] <%JailShmixRemix> I don't blame anyone for liking the game tbh
[2:04:15] <+ratreborn> The complaints to the ending are overblown
[2:04:25] <+ratreborn> out of context it seems worse than it is
[2:04:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Hey the game looks and sounds good, that's pretty on brand for a Final Fantasy Game
[2:04:27] <arkv01> and finding out they eat children
[2:04:30] <Medo3G> the feeling is "why the fuck"
[2:04:39] <tokenreefer> equip new weapon
[2:04:41] <Explodincatz> second guessing
[2:04:50] <arkv01> like its kinda fucked up and repulsive but I guess we're still friends
[2:05:03] <penitentpentwitch> The ending feels like a declaration of 'we defeated the spectre of canon so I can do whatever in the next games'
[2:05:09] <IntrepidEye> I like the game and my reaction was 'but..but why? That stupid
[2:05:15] <zincowl> is he talking irl or the game i just got here
[2:05:17] <xeros720> yeah
[2:05:29] <+ratreborn> the ending is the least of its problem
[2:05:29] <gunsrlove> He doesnt seem to, he is very enamoured wirth it
[2:05:35] <+CrimsonDio11> we will find out in an hour when he beats the final boss
[2:05:40] <arkv01> yeeeea gurls!
[2:05:41] <tokenreefer> youre forgetting the new weapon
[2:05:48] <%JailShmixRemix> Lol
[2:05:51] <IntrepidEye> Yeah the little interactions are the best
[2:05:53] <penitentpentwitch> Leveled up the new weapon, didn't equip it
[2:05:54] <JoeBecomesJoe> The fans are the whispers and nomura is going to break the characters free
[2:06:07] <xeros720> i spent a few days even rationalizing it in the canon, but it feels so nonsensical
[2:06:08] <arkv01> feels bad for the real writer when nomura starts editing his script
[2:06:09] <BurdRightsActivist> I'm watching max's stream and mods are banning subs who say Nomura or Kingdom hearts jokes
[2:06:13] <+HawkGoggles2> Yeah, 15 was really good with character interactions as well.
[2:06:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Nojima putting in work
[2:06:31] <tokenreefer> NEW WEAPON
[2:06:36] <arkv01> @BurdRightsActivist oof, that's tyrannical
[2:06:38] <penitentpentwitch> Good gameplay, stilted storytelling
[2:06:40] <gunsrlove> Genius Norumbo
[2:06:46] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LOL
[2:06:50] <JoeBecomesJoe> My take on it is that it's good but not great. Just fine
[2:06:57] <NeroIscariot12> Kazushige Nojima? he was the OG writer as well. But he also worked on KH and other dumb shit as well. So theres no consistency
[2:07:01] <BurdRightsActivist> @arkv01 Desenters banned, only "HURR PURISTS" circlejerks allowed
[2:07:06] <Monstergelo> @JoeBecomesJoe booringest take
[2:07:07] <BurdRightsActivist> It's pretty bad
[2:07:08] <arkv01> the dog turd was kinda uh mmmm salty
[2:07:22] <examplez0> Nojima gave us the blitzball bomb
[2:07:22] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura telling us we liked FF7 for the wrong reasons
[2:07:32] <xeros720> the frustrating bit is there's a good amount of decent storybeats and then that happens
[2:07:36] <BurdRightsActivist> Hold up did I miss Red XIII fucking Aerith super hardcore?
[2:07:39] <Maids4lyfe> what about the new sword?
[2:07:46] <arkv01> kitase was like NAW I AIN'T DON SHIT LUL
[2:07:54] <JoeBecomesJoe> @Monstergelo I know stupid people have to say it's either amazing or the worst thing ever but thats just not how life works
[2:08:00] <TheWe4pon> yeah @burdrightsactivist missed the knot and all
[2:08:07] <gunsrlove> FUCK THE POWA
[2:08:08] <penitentpentwitch> The Sacredness of The Role of Leadership
[2:08:17] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i feel the not speaking ill is why nomura is allowed to go crazy
[2:08:28] <BurdRightsActivist> @TheWe4pon Damn. I wanted to see Ancient v Dog Knotting action
[2:08:33] <BurdRightsActivist> "GUYS IT'S NOT NOMURA, IT
[2:08:44] <penitentpentwitch> Game version of 'Not Editing George Lucas'?
[2:08:46] <BurdRightsActivist> "IT'S NOMINBO OR WHATEVER. GET BANNED, IDIOT"
[2:08:48] <IntrepidEye> Max is looking not very entertained right now
[2:08:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> even bad ideas arent allowed to be shot down, and ihave a genuine feeling nomura over not getting verus 13 has been fucking with games
[2:09:03] <+UnwoundCaesar70> "Nomura is just the director guys"
[2:09:11] <arkv01> nomura with red's body
[2:09:11] <BurdRightsActivist> @IntrepidEye DARKNESS WITHIN DARKNESS AWAITS YOU CLOUDS
[2:09:12] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:09:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> but he got 13 Versus, that's what FF15 is
[2:09:16] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo Max's chat is shitting all over the Nomura-inspired Finale
[2:09:18] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes but here's what I will say even though it was all Nomura this is probably the best Nomura has done yet and this is coming from someone who's played every kh game
[2:09:23] <NeroIscariot12> I mean even outside Nomura, the co-director is Motomu "FFX-2, XIII trilogy, 3rd birthday" Toriyama. This was going to happen LUL
[2:09:24] <danielm427> i love "nomura the dog"
[2:09:27] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LUL
[2:09:29] <examplez0> Nomura did nothing wrong it's everyone else's fault
[2:09:36] <NineBall3D> LUL LUL LUL
[2:09:41] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh Nomura LUL
[2:09:41] <don_fluffle> Not speaking ill of superiors get's you morally questionable experiments done to POW
[2:09:45] <Explodincatz> LUL
[2:09:50] <theloganbrand> Big fan of this 10 minute dog shiting on ice cream monologue
[2:09:50] <mslizard> I will never think of dog shit the same
[2:09:56] <+HawkGoggles2> The ice cream shitting dog will be a new sitcom.
[2:09:58] <locobo98> KAPOW
[2:10:01] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's still no new blood at SE
[2:10:06] <Medo3G> I am not a fan of this analogy
[2:10:08] <+HawkGoggles2> Call him scoop.
[2:10:09] <%Samex_Comex> I don't want icecream anymore
[2:10:31] <tokenreefer> plagueFace
[2:10:32] <xeros720> we can argue about the volume of shit, but we have to agree to keep that dog out of the room
[2:10:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> to be fair, the giant DRUM on the front of the building now has a purpose
[2:10:37] <ahaegotrigger> https://clips.twitch.tv/ResilientCorrectCodEagleEye
[2:10:40] <arkv01> good thing I finished all my ice cream last night
[2:10:49] <Huntercd> HoJo still jerking it
[2:10:52] <penitentpentwitch> An unfortunate moment for my favorite ice cream to be cookies and cream. I guess that would be birds rather than dogs?
[2:10:54] <ahaegotrigger> I hope I spelled that name right
[2:11:11] <+whiskywolfe> More padding than Yuffie's bra.
[2:11:12] <MilkingEdge> Hojo data creep
[2:11:13] <%JailShmixRemix> Nomura :p
[2:11:20] <ahaegotrigger> thank you
[2:11:20] <Sokumotanaka> We doing saw now?
[2:11:21] <Medo3G> it's funny how obvious padding is in this game
[2:11:33] <arkv01> was that the codec noise
[2:11:37] <tokenreefer> equip weapon
[2:11:50] <Maids4lyfe> what about your new sword?
[2:12:01] <arkv01> red's got some sticky paws
[2:12:03] <penitentpentwitch> Equip weapon and Barret materia?
[2:12:14] <%Samex_Comex> Who put feathers on his head?
[2:12:17] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes Dont patronize red
[2:12:21] <arkv01> reds looking at you like he wants you to enjoy his poopies
[2:12:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's Red who had shit on his ice cream
[2:12:25] <Maids4lyfe> he put the feathers in his own hair
[2:12:30] <gunsrlove> More of a feline imo
[2:12:31] <%JailShmixRemix> Feces?
[2:12:32] <penitentpentwitch> If nothing else, they did top notch with their 'likeable animal' designs
[2:12:34] <examplez0> He's whatever you want him to be
[2:12:36] <gunsrlove> a scroungy feline
[2:12:41] <MilkingEdge> Lionwolf
[2:12:42] <+HawkGoggles2> Red's a lot o things don't think about it.
[2:12:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> he has feline nose, but canine body
[2:12:44] <Explodincatz> the son of Catdog
[2:12:44] <xeros720> he's big like a wolf
[2:12:47] <ScreamLord> Wolion
[2:12:52] <smugfox95> He definitely looks more feline
[2:12:56] <mslizard> I wish I could animate the dog shit in ice cream speech
[2:12:57] <examplez0> Woolieon
[2:12:58] <arkv01> don't jest at red's poopies!
[2:13:15] <$jamarartdoodles> lol
[2:13:16] <xeros720> he clearly shits rainbows
[2:13:18] <tokenreefer> now you can re equip materia
[2:13:20] <jiin6> Eat hair
[2:13:22] <examplez0> I want to eat Tifa's golden brown
[2:13:22] <Sokumotanaka> You right, I'm sorry plague
[2:13:27] <mrgaster8> yum ymuy ymu
[2:13:32] <MilkingEdge> Eat hair to grow hair
[2:13:33] <arkv01> yeah cloud's been muttering mmmm dogshit in his sleep
[2:13:33] <+stephentoostronk> mmm hair plagueFace
[2:13:34] <%Samex_Comex> That's why Plague is bald he ate his hair
[2:13:40] <SuperVaderMan> Deep fried tifa hair
[2:13:41] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes so since we know this isnt a 1:1 recreation of the og game would a better name in stead of FF7 Remake have been FF7 Retold?
[2:13:42] <Sokumotanaka> What abotu Barret ladies!?
[2:13:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> remember, this is all worth it when we see Red standing on his hind legs in a shinra uniform
[2:13:45] <TheWe4pon> He has to be a dog if he has a knot, unless you think he has a barber dick.
[2:13:48] <jiin6> she will explode
[2:13:48] <BurdRightsActivist> Man, Max's chat is just a circlejerk of Consoomers. Holy shit lmao
[2:13:52] <theloganbrand> What if Aerith and Tifa kissed right now
[2:13:52] <examplez0> So at least that's accurate to the original
[2:14:02] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague got hungry and ate his own hair plagueFace
[2:14:04] <arkv01> to lure in more children ScaredyCat
[2:14:08] <jiin6> Child experiments duh
[2:14:09] <theloganbrand> Hojo said fuck them kids
[2:14:18] <Dao_Puppy> Shinra might hate the planet, but they realllly hate children.

[2:20:31] <xeros720> want hints based in the original game?
[2:21:04] <penitentpentwitch> Don't forget to equip your new sword too
[2:21:28] <MilkingEdge> Nomura likes your suffering plague

[2:25:24] <examplez0> Pick number 3
[2:25:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> They need Ward 3 open
[2:25:56] <tokenreefer> you can just look for them in game
[2:26:01] <examplez0> Pick number 3 my lord
[2:26:14] <penitentpentwitch> It's a 'puzzle'
[2:26:17] <tokenreefer> they did tell you
[2:26:21] <tokenreefer> lmao
[2:26:27] <sosandstorm> they mentioned in dialogue, streamer tax
[2:26:31] <+whiskywolfe> Jesus this is so slow.
[2:26:55] <xeros720> real series of speedbumps
[2:26:59] <penitentpentwitch> Welcome to the padding section, 4 cup sizes and growing
[2:27:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Tifa has a snappy wheel kick
[2:27:26] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> this chapter really killed the pacing of the last chapter
[2:27:29] <sosandstorm> speaking of chopped and screwed lore, 40k!
[2:27:31] <tokenreefer> duck doger in the 21st and 1/2 century
[2:27:32] <+CrimsonDio11> so plague just a fair warning I am also watching max play the final sequence and um dont die during any of final boss sequences cause there's no checkpoints apparently
[2:27:46] <mrgaster8> max just died a little
[2:27:51] <Medo3G> ez
[2:27:52] <tolloponik> max is at the end what a load of horse shit
[2:28:05] <penitentpentwitch> Max has been a little conservative with healing the last couple of sections, not that much of a surprise
[2:28:07] <mrgaster8> inside
[2:28:11] <examplez0> Now this I gotta see
[2:28:18] <tokenreefer> combat is horrible in corridors/stairs
[2:28:23] <+Slaardacity> there are checkpoints
[2:28:32] <shiny_prinny> it's ok when it makes sense but this game uses it everywhere
[2:28:44] <TheWe4pon> knot time?
[2:28:59] <Tikigod784> that animation
[2:29:07] <Sokumotanaka> He wanna give tifa that knot

[2:29:13] <theloganbrand> horny
[2:29:14] <Sokumotanaka> Berzerk?
[2:29:15] <tokenreefer> combat gets wonky on stairs

[2:29:27] <%hgtarras> hgtarras extended their Tier 1 subscription through May! 
[2:29:31] <Explodincatz> super horny
[2:29:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:29:38] <MilkingEdge> He 's loaded up on that mako juice
[2:29:40] <%Samex_Comex> Do what!?
[2:29:40] <seth45er> Cause the scene need him to be a wild animal
[2:29:44] <Tikigod784> Thirteen Times as Horny as most humans
[2:29:45] <penitentpentwitch> He had no reason to believe they weren't part of Shinra until Aerith mind melded him?
[2:30:04] <Tikigod784> quick, get the viagra materia
[2:30:04] <Explodincatz> i thought she did
[2:30:09] <sosandstorm> shit, you're right
[2:30:19] <MilkingEdge> Jesus Aeris
[2:30:22] <Tikigod784> Viag, Viagra, Viagaga
[2:30:22] <tokenreefer> she connected his
[2:30:31] <penitentpentwitch> Fake tention
[2:30:31] <danielm427> for no reason
[2:30:36] <penitentpentwitch> *tension
[2:30:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> "Red XIII? What's that?" - Nomura
[2:30:40] <tokenreefer> she connected his left/right hemispheres
[2:30:51] <Sokumotanaka> Because nomura wanted it
[2:31:07] <mrgaster8> meh
[2:31:13] <jo_vo> FF7 world plot is just Chrono Trigger without the time hopping
[2:31:21] <examplez0> Until now
[2:31:25] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:31:25] <jo_vo> Yep
[2:31:27] <Sokumotanaka> You kinda do sometimes but the red point IS a good topic to bring up
[2:31:32] <BurdRightsActivist> As someone who never watched Enagneleon is
[2:31:36] <penitentpentwitch> Critical thinking, in my nostalgia? Less likely than you think!
[2:31:36] <BurdRightsActivist> " it's a great plot, just like the rebuild of Evangelion"
[2:31:38] <BurdRightsActivist> a joke?
[2:31:38] <arkv01> doggo go brrr haha
[2:31:41] <xeros720> red 13 is cool dog thing, yes
[2:31:56] <GiygasDrillBreak> cool rat dog, yes
[2:32:01] <TheWe4pon> I'll have you know I like my consumptions to be of quality.
[2:32:03] <sosandstorm> My assumption wouldn't have been that she gave him speech, but it would totally make sense for someone to think that
[2:32:03] <Tikigod784> Nomura is like Kojima but he enjoys working at the company he's at
[2:32:09] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> its kind of what bothers me about hojo. for most people ohh mad scientist but i just wanna know whats his motivation. what the fuck happened to make him so crazy
[2:32:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura also lacks embezzlement skills that Kojima has
[2:32:35] <Medo3G> break his bones fairly quickly
[2:32:37] <mrgaster8> dog cat go moo
[2:32:42] <examplez0> Embezzlement? Do tell.
[2:33:02] <MartiusGW> @GiygasDrillBreak even after ff13 versus?
[2:33:07] <BurdRightsActivist> At this point we should forgive the shit Kojima has done, at least he tries whacky nonsense as opposed to the same, tired old au/timetravel fan-fiction bullshit
[2:33:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF13 versus didnt cost as much as FF13
[2:33:27] <penitentpentwitch> 'Rubber Neck Potential'?
[2:33:32] <Dao_Puppy> They fail upwards from the lower ranks where everyone specializes in one thing. Or something.
[2:33:39] <arkv01> haha remember kojima and silent hills
[2:33:42] <arkv01> wew, dodged a bullet
[2:33:43] <examplez0> It never was
[2:33:43] <+firmlygraspi1> MGS2 ending tho
[2:33:44] <ahaegotrigger> it shouldnt be
[2:33:47] <Medo3G> H o t T a k e
[2:33:50] <theloganbrand> Kojima likes to tell instead of show
[2:33:53] <danielm427> not after death stranding
[2:33:55] <Sokumotanaka> SAme thing goes for america writers too it's just we dont pay attention to them COuGH Miles luna, David cage
[2:34:00] <BurdRightsActivist> Nah koji's not the best writer, I'm just glad he's actually willing to try new whacky shit
[2:34:01] <GiygasDrillBreak> brand new movie theater in a brand new studio, on Sony's dime. "you need a movie theater to make your game, why?" is what Sony didnt ask
[2:34:12] <BurdRightsActivist> THE VIRGIN NONUMBO VS CHAD KOJUMBO
[2:34:18] <Dao_Puppy> ...but "princess beach".
[2:34:19] <examplez0> He was great back when he had Tomokazu Fukushima as a co-writer
[2:34:20] <MartiusGW> @GiygasDrillBreak maybe if we count cost of ff15
[2:34:31] <theloganbrand> Tifa was trying to seduce it
[2:34:33] <tokenreefer> director of platinum games?
[2:34:34] <majeser> swery?
[2:34:35] <Dereh0g> After Kojima's cowriter left the team writing went downhill fast
[2:34:38] <examplez0> Unlike Kojima, Nomura never had a "good period"
[2:34:41] <%hgtarras> I think it showed with death stranding that his ideas are crazy and can just make whatever and people will buy it
[2:34:49] <BurdRightsActivist> Jesus christ Tifa is busted
[2:34:57] <examplez0> @Dereh0g Yep MGS4 was when the series well and truly jump the shark
[2:34:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> they built FF15 with assets of FF13 Versus, which was built on FF13's software
[2:35:01] <+Slaardacity> the slow walking is the worst man
[2:35:07] <examplez0> He already did it's called MGS4
[2:35:08] <theloganbrand> He's been trying to make a movie since mgs3
[2:35:10] <+firmlygraspi1> Kojima should make movie trailers
[2:35:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF13 Versus was from the FF13 budget
[2:35:12] <+spacehouse> Kojima wants to be Harvey Weinstein's best buddy
[2:35:13] <penitentpentwitch> Poor Kojima if he succeed in making a movie
[2:35:28] <Explodincatz> its so damn slow
[2:35:28] <Sokumotanaka> Again david cage
[2:35:33] <tokenreefer> swery and suda 51 100%
[2:35:33] <%LordSDB> Death stranding is already a 9hr movie
[2:35:35] <TheWe4pon> he would make a 20hr movie. and not cut up.
[2:35:44] <examplez0> It's like he turned in a first draft and they just went with that
[2:35:48] <+CrimsonDio11> the issue is I remember seeing something where Kojima said that he would never make a movie because he prefers the Video Game medium
[2:35:55] <arkv01> very evocative but then strands and beaches
[2:35:59] <mxt8420> whine whine whine
[2:36:02] <examplez0> So basically MGS4
[2:36:03] <Sokumotanaka> So rwby bascially
[2:36:03] <%hgtarras> Death stranding perfect example. The gameplay doesn’t exist
[2:36:09] <Medo3G> david lynch
[2:36:09] <+whiskywolfe> David Lynch
[2:36:11] <penitentpentwitch> It would come with a 40 page explanation pamphlet?
[2:36:12] <+spacehouse> David Lynch
[2:36:15] <mxt8420> must happen a lot
[2:36:16] <TheWe4pon> Princess Beach
[2:36:22] <mxt8420> you whiny brainlet
[2:36:32] <%hgtarras> Whole new world and people start throwing out terms that were never introduced
[2:36:39] <arkv01> david lynch yeah
[2:36:42] <jo_vo> I wonder if Tifa is gonna show off her big ol chest scar in the Kalm recounting
[2:36:49] <MilkingEdge> Top 10 anime brain betryals
[2:36:59] <Dao_Puppy> Right now the best japanese writer is that polish guy who did "World of Horror".
[2:37:02] <xeros720> nah, death stranding's gameplay exists and works, but it has a more narrow appeal
[2:37:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> Kojima actually went to university for making movies, but immediately directs MSX video games
[2:37:10] <examplez0> Go around and open the door
[2:37:11] <tokenreefer> later
[2:37:13] <mrgaster8> do u plan on finishing tomorrow
[2:37:15] <Fredcome2bed> thoose two are not even closely comparable
[2:37:26] <MilkingEdge> Kojama
[2:37:29] <xeros720> komura?!
[2:37:31] <examplez0> But without the quality writing
[2:37:32] <arkv01> kojima used to be force fed movies when he was a kid
[2:37:33] <gazdropish> @plagueofgripes ff7r is a story about a story. Not about a planet, life or whatever. That's the worst part, it's mindless fanservice
[2:37:38] <tokenreefer> you forget swery and suda 51
[2:37:45] <TheWe4pon> What if Kojima made a Policenauts remake?
[2:37:50] <arkv01> NOPE
[2:37:57] <jo_vo> omfg Policenauts
[2:37:59] <+spacehouse> @PlagueOfGripes I dont get why ppl want Kojima to do Silent Hill, like he wouldn't piss all over it
[2:37:59] <examplez0> @gazdropish Same goes for Advent Children
[2:38:04] <jo_vo> He would, wouldn't he
[2:38:11] <Fredcome2bed> interested in the new dume series at all?
[2:38:12] <MilkingEdge> Fall tifa
[2:38:21] <mrgaster8> @jo_vo was so funng
[2:38:23] <Dao_Puppy> @TheWe4pon VR Game with soft body physics.
[2:38:27] <mrgaster8> funny
[2:38:35] <Sokumotanaka> KNOTTED
[2:38:36] <+firmlygraspi1> Aerith just splats
[2:38:39] <arkv01> @spacehouse people aren't thinking it through, they think of a silent hill with modern graphics and a big name director like kojima and they go wooohooo
[2:38:45] <MilkingEdge> Pies could handle the weight of tifas nboobs
[2:38:50] <MilkingEdge> pipes
[2:38:54] <Josshoo> @gazdropish I dont think the story is great, but its more charitable to say its a story about fate, destiny, and truth
[2:40:20] <arkv01> I love the pairing in this section though, tifa aeris tifa power couple
[2:40:41] <Trinity5> hey plague
[2:40:42] <JoeBecomesJoe> blanka ball
[2:40:46] <Trinity5> hope you're doing aight
[2:40:51] <MilkingEdge> Rollout
[2:40:57] <sosandstorm> PT
[2:41:04] <tokenreefer> dont forget ladder chest
[2:41:30] <cyberblueneon> kojima wouldnt necessarily ruin silent hill, as long as they didnt put him in charge of the story, he has strengths as a game creator like attention to detail and creative ways of designing gameplay.
[2:41:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> problem there, Kojima never works with a project he didn't write
[2:41:58] <examplez0> Kojima is a brilliant game designer but a mediocre at best writer
[2:42:04] <Trinity5> the dick makes it cuter
[2:42:08] <sosandstorm> "ruin silent hill" is a hilarious idea with all the dumpster fires that have come out of that IP
[2:42:17] <penitentpentwitch> The beauty of a 'lean story'
[2:42:20] <TheWe4pon> Plague did you do anything with Aerith's new weapon?
[2:42:29] <jo_vo> Square in the late 90s had a real hardon for angels. Parasite Eve... Woof.
[2:42:30] <+CrimsonDio11> people forget that he was working with Guillermo Del Torro who I believe was co writing it
[2:42:31] <theloganbrand> Nothing gets the girls wetter then industrial piping.
[2:42:32] <arkv01> just like how they "ruined" front mission FeelsBadMan
[2:42:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> "This isn't FF7, this is only a tribute."
[2:42:41] <gazdropish> @Josshoo i don't agree. it's literally about the fact that final fantasy 7 happened and some people don't want to change anything about it. it doesn't stand on it's own.
[2:42:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> thanks ark, reminding me of Left Alive
[2:42:58] <Explodincatz> what
[2:43:00] <theloganbrand> Y'know, it makes me glad the N64 zelda games on the 3ds are as good as they are
[2:43:02] <arkv01> 90 squares was peak, even now they're trying to live up to that era
[2:43:17] <jo_vo> Parasite Eve 2 though
[2:43:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> FF7 Remake could have been Left Alive, that's how lucky we are
[2:43:48] <sosandstorm> Stagomancy
[2:43:57] <xeros720> they really let videogames be videogames, not weird anime things
[2:44:13] <xeros720> in the 90s i mean
[2:45:07] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes will the vod for today's stream be viewable on twitch or youtube?
[2:45:33] <arkv01> I don't think plague uploads streams to youtube yeah?
[2:45:47] <mrgaster8> twitch
[2:46:06] <%caramello_man> he puts all his streams on youtube eventually
[2:47:15] <JoeBecomesJoe> Sounds like a stephen king book
[2:47:16] <penitentpentwitch> "Write what you know" taken to its logical extreme?
[2:47:31] <examplez0> Oh shit I didn't know you wrote a novel
[2:47:35] <sosuke5> You mean how every webcomic MC is either in college or works in a coffee shop?
[2:47:36] <gazdropish> that's sad but understandable
[2:47:37] <examplez0> What's it called?
[2:48:11] <MilkingEdge> anime within anime
[2:48:32] <arkv01> 4th wall in your 4th wall
[2:48:41] <arkv01> 16 walls
[2:48:50] <xeros720> self-referencing?
[2:49:17] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I agree, but I wonder if it's the best approach for FFVIIR. Either you do the same as we already know, or soft reboot it, keep the familiar but swtill provide more mystery and engagement for a well established lore
[2:49:22] <tokenreefer> basically all isekais
[2:49:23] <examplez0> Sounds like the writing for the Sonic Boom cartoon
[2:49:35] <Dereh0g> The main thing is that if you take out all meta elements it still should be a good story
[2:49:38] <arkv01> what if amy ate sonic and felt horrific guilt about it
[2:49:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:49:45] <+crowmium> LUL
[2:49:47] <seth45er> dark thoughts a meta deconstruction
[2:49:54] <+firmlygraspi1> what if I'm Toby Fox?
[2:50:00] <mrgaster8> oo no
[2:50:01] <Trinity5> LUL
[2:50:03] <arkv01> oh NO PLAGUE NOT THIS

[2:50:07] <arkv01> LYL
[2:50:08] <sosandstorm> YUP
[2:50:09] <MilkingEdge> What if sonic fucked pikachu
[2:50:15] <Trinity5> that like two days in freshman year high school
[2:50:15] <thecrazyanbu> But I AM the only person who exists
[2:50:17] <Sokumotanaka> I never had that honestly
[2:50:25] <examplez0> I still have it
[2:50:27] <hellfirejefe> maybe I'm the only person who doesn't exist?
[2:50:29] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague, I am a genius though :)
[2:50:30] <spiritofmojave> I'm special meeeee :)
[2:50:30] <%Samex_Comex> This is my world I made it me!
[2:50:38] <penitentpentwitch> Benefits of empathy, understanding other people feel. Problems with projection, thinking everyone goes through the same thing.
[2:50:42] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I had a kid in my class who thought he was only real person in the world
[2:50:45] <xeros720> toby fox i think went through the worst parts in his earthbound hacks
[2:50:54] <arkv01> we are all kings and queens
[2:50:55] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:51:01] <arkv01> but I'm the only emperor LUL
[2:51:16] <+UnwoundCaesar70> What if its friendship
[2:51:18] <mrgaster8> BibleThump
[2:51:19] <mihajlovelikii> hello plague never did i imagine seing your face but hey it had to happen eventualy
[2:51:21] <penitentpentwitch> He writes for the audience he most identifies with?
[2:51:24] <theloganbrand> "My story is like the Matrix...but better some how"
[2:51:29] <jo_vo> What if WE are the shades of grey?
[2:51:32] <MilkingEdge> THe darkness within us all
[2:51:41] <tokenreefer> you forget to equip clouds new weapon
[2:51:48] <gazdropish> watching this stream and maximilians at the same time and i feel insane
[2:51:52] <tolloponik> at the end and what is there even left to do with this game, also its likee watching someone play with action figures
[2:52:02] <+firmlygraspi1> those thoughts didn't make me think I was smart, it was more of a deep sorrow
[2:52:17] <xeros720> yeah, the creative process
[2:52:19] <Trinity5> yeah that sounds like paige
[2:52:22] <Medo3G> shots fired
[2:52:40] <xeros720> hell, old people will do that
[2:52:40] <doggieo> I like how Red is always looking up at you
[2:52:42] <mrgaster8> baby steps
[2:52:48] <Dereh0g> What if all my thoughts and actions are infinitely small and amount to nothing?
[2:52:54] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> no plague you dont understand, i have a big brain and everyone else has a small brain
[2:52:59] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> My Game Design teachers drilled the phrase into us: "Your ideas are shit"
[2:53:03] <MilkingEdge> big gamble mindset
[2:53:07] <penitentpentwitch> Pulling one resets others
[2:53:09] <gunsrlove> @PlagueOfGripes Kojima already did kind of make his attempt at a movie with DeathStranding. He loves Mad Max Fury Road, and I think DS was his attempt to ROUGHLY follow the same structure in his weird and very awkward way
[2:53:28] <Trinity5> you can't
[2:53:33] <xeros720> grandpa learns to email and next thing he's telling you about his brilliant business idea
[2:53:41] <Hydrapissed> lol
[2:54:04] <Futurecity10> I've slowly been writing a book for like, 6 years
[2:54:10] <arkv01> "lissen up sonny, if we pretend to be nigerian princes through this email thingamajig..."
[2:54:16] <Trinity5> except for that one dude who looked at ffxv and was like "hey i could make a game out of this"
[2:54:19] <%bettysharkface> People with ADD/ADHD have a tendency to get overly enthusiastic about things and then burn themselves out...
[2:54:26] <Vaiire> I think a good take away someone recently said to me was "don't let perfection get in the way of being good enough."
[2:54:36] <Hydrapissed> snake eeaatterrrr
[2:54:39] <Hydrapissed> dunnn dunn dun
[2:54:46] <Sokumotanaka> yup
[2:54:52] <gunsrlove> Unless you repeat your own antics all the time, like Nomura
[2:54:57] <arkv01> sometimes you gotta eat a treefrog
[2:55:05] <+firmlygraspi1> younger or drunk
[2:55:05] <examplez0> Yes
[2:55:06] <Trinity5> when pikachu cried for ash
[2:55:06] <BatQuest> You would think so, but then you end up with things like Kingdom Hearts.
[2:55:07] <Trinity5> i felt that
[2:55:10] <mrgaster8> yes
[2:55:15] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> no being cute allowed
[2:55:16] <BatQuest> Time doesn't heal all bad ideas.
[2:55:22] <xeros720> i tutor science at a local college, i'm practically screaming at people to adding things to their first experiment they make
[2:55:34] <xeros720> to stop, that is
[2:55:43] <jo_vo> JJ Abrams fears conclusions
[2:55:56] <jo_vo> But MAN people want to hire him.
[2:56:00] <tolloponik> this game sucks man
[2:56:15] <hellfirejefe> everyone has that monster of a universe they created that they don't want to let go of
[2:56:26] <MilkingEdge> HUGEEE

[2:56:50] <xeros720> the NWF is coming back too with cloud and jessie
[2:56:51] <$RC_S3kshun8> @PlagueOfGripes "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take"
[2:56:52] <gnollAUS> Quests are fun as hell
[2:57:13] <Hydrapissed> so nomura hey ohhhhhhhh
[2:57:15] <penitentpentwitch> The weird power of things that you don't care enough to be paranoid about quality control.
[2:57:16] <jo_vo> I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream
[2:57:18] <examplez0> Alec Guiness
[2:57:21] <tolloponik> collage tought me thateverytime I went for an a
[2:57:22] <+some_brave_apollo> Alec Guinness
[2:57:29] <Ghostduck01> did I miss much?
[2:57:31] <tolloponik> I got a C+
[2:57:33] <%bettysharkface> Is the lesson...don't be afraid to get stupid with it?
[2:57:49] <$RC_S3kshun8> Sir Alec Guinness
[2:58:04] <jo_vo> Haaaaaa
[2:58:06] <Ralfclogs> The big projects that are successful are group projects
[2:58:06] <Futurecity10> downtown abby?
[2:58:07] <Medo3G> he's not wrong tho
[2:58:11] <examplez0> The Bridge on the River Kwai
[2:58:12] <$RC_S3kshun8> "Whoa shit this stuff is lucrative. I'm in."
[2:58:12] <KaiserMario> He was right, tho... but... asshole move...
[2:58:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> Lawrence of Arabia, HAH
[2:58:26] <xeros720> given how they saved star wars in the editing, i don't blame his opinion
[2:58:31] <sosandstorm> Oh shit he WAS in Lawrence of Arabia
[2:58:39] <thecrazyanbu> Doctor Zhivago too
[2:58:54] <jo_vo> Oh man, to see the Original Star Wars edit that Lucas had cobbled together
[2:58:56] <thecrazyanbu> Granted I had to look up what he did
[2:59:18] <examplez0> The first season of TNG is the worst first season I've ever sat through
[2:59:23] <KaiserMario> That's "in character" for Picard
[2:59:25] <+firmlygraspi1> he said "You motherfuckers are gonna kill my career!"
[2:59:34] <gunsrlove> Stewart does have ..uuh....X-men? WHich might be more known to younger generations
[2:59:35] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> And now we have Picard
[2:59:43] <BillieNoMates> Will Wheaton was a child actor with no talent. patrick stewart was in other shit for years
[2:59:45] <gunsrlove> He was in Dune, briefly
[2:59:47] <gnollAUS> There are heaps of successful media that the makers hated. I think Sherlock Homes is one example. The maker of that hated that sequence of books but they raked in so much cash. So all there other books that they liked making never made that much but that line did.
[2:59:49] <examplez0> Will Wheaton (Wesley's actor) quit the show because his character was despised and he kept getting shafted
[2:59:56] <+Nicos143> I still don’t know what else Rikers actor did
[3:00:07] <penitentpentwitch> The draw of the broadest appeal
[3:00:12] <thecrazyanbu> I thought Patrick Stewart was pretty fond of playing Picard
[3:00:13] <gnollAUS> Touch so many people
[3:00:14] <Fredcome2bed> "I am not spook"
[3:00:22] <thecrazyanbu> Same with Leonard Nimoy
[3:00:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> Wheaton thought he got a movie deal, acted like getting fired would improve his career. so he didnt get fired, he got put in awful shoots and scripts
[3:00:33] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> rimers actor was in that mystery show
[3:00:34] <xeros720> no wonder the continuations of later Holmes stories are awful
[3:00:39] <arkv01> so like stargate SG-1?
[3:00:42] <+whiskywolfe> Well said.
[3:00:43] <$RC_S3kshun8> Shatner hated Trek I think, but I thought Stewart rather enjoyed it
[3:00:51] <GiygasDrillBreak> then Wheaton's movie career didnt take off
[3:00:57] <$RC_S3kshun8> But Shatner is also a massive cuntrocket, so YMMV
[3:00:58] <examplez0> Stargate SG-1 had a great first half and a tedious second half
[3:00:59] <jo_vo> Sounds like Shrine of Amana, but for writing
[3:00:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> so Wheaton got stuck with jack
[3:01:00] <Hydrapissed> comfyUhh
[3:01:03] <+firmlygraspi1> That message sucks Plague!
[3:01:05] <%bettysharkface> Things people relate to, without poetry.
[3:01:08] <kuzokai> unga LuvUok
[3:01:16] <Hydrapissed> what about giant sword proof
[3:01:18] <Hydrapissed> CLOUD GO
[3:01:37] <Ralfclogs> Why does undertale work then?
[3:01:47] <BillieNoMates> The way to descirbe it is simply throw more shit at a wall and you are likely to make a success
[3:01:48] <arkv01> nomura was the 13th apostle
[3:01:49] <Trinity5> nomura hated god because he talked about light and darkness first
[3:01:52] <Trinity5> and he didnt' even do that
[3:01:56] <BillieNoMates> Regardless of what you think will succeed
[3:02:08] <Hydrapissed> hmmm two two links
[3:02:10] <Hydrapissed> thats neat
[3:02:11] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The kitchen sink ideas are the worst
[3:02:12] <thecrazyanbu> There have been some pretty out there stories that have managed to walk the walk. Stalker (the movie) comes to mind
[3:02:17] <Dereh0g> The bible is a narrative within a narrative, change my mind
[3:02:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> Stewart got to be Professor X, so he's famous for that more than Picard
[3:02:53] <tokenreefer> steal from it
[3:02:56] <$RC_S3kshun8> CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE
[3:03:00] <$RC_S3kshun8> fuck yeah
[3:03:05] <thecrazyanbu> I'd say Picard is his most well known role
[3:03:08] <spiritofmojave> SLOPPY!
[3:03:13] <JoeBecomesJoe> Punish mode me daddy
[3:03:27] <mihajlovelikii> what the fuck is clouds stance
[3:03:34] <$RC_S3kshun8> Cloud: UGH, GOD I HATE THIS SO MUCH. Tell me I'm the coolest plz
[3:04:27] <MilkingEdge> Hojo I got many sex toys
[3:04:28] <$RC_S3kshun8> And then he goes and takes a massive dump, leaving his microphone on.
[3:04:35] <$RC_S3kshun8> Man I miss the Naked Gun series.
[3:04:39] <JoeBecomesJoe> Lots of mp though
[3:04:45] <xeros720> physical yeah
[3:04:49] <gunsrlove> That sword design looks horrible
[3:04:52] <Trinity5> hardedge got the big number for physical ye
[3:04:57] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Yeah Hardedge is the best DPS, Buster is the most balanced
[3:05:06] <Hydrapissed> Counter stance OP op
[3:05:08] <Hydrapissed> bout it
[3:05:09] <gunsrlove> It looks like a trophy you'd buy from a sketchy gift shop
[3:05:11] <%Demirose41> the ability is really good
[3:05:19] <xeros720> in hard mode, def and the reprieve skill are real useful
[3:05:21] <Trinity5> i gotta say i do like the ability system in this game
[3:05:24] <TheWe4pon> 4 materia shown. wow
[3:05:30] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> dont forget to upgrade the sword
[3:05:33] <arkv01> but plague you're HUEGE
[3:06:05] <penitentpentwitch> It's nice that you don't have to heal your guest characters
[3:06:05] <arkv01> for the fleas
[3:06:08] <xeros720> you can see the materia on it, yeah
[3:06:10] <Hydrapissed> they shoulda added like a option in the vendors to just fuse potions or something lol
[3:06:21] <MilkingEdge> Doggie collar
[3:06:35] <theloganbrand> At least it's not a dagger like every other game dog
[3:06:45] <Sokumotanaka> Barret mad
[3:06:49] <jo_vo> Fire+all, Sense?
[3:06:59] <$jamarartdoodles> Or fuse materia for higer stats
[3:06:59] <%Samex_Comex> Shoot harder!
[3:07:04] <arkv01> oh NO!
[3:07:05] <jo_vo> BOOOOOOOO
[3:07:07] <sosandstorm> it WAS pretty cool looking
[3:07:18] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Well you don't stop shooting when you have endless clip on
[3:07:22] <Hydrapissed> Brain pods?
[3:07:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> Noooo not my Red Legoshi-rini
[3:07:24] <Sokumotanaka> Magic pots
[3:07:26] <spiritofmojave> Brain Pods
[3:07:39] <tokenreefer> Braun pods
[3:07:42] <jo_vo> Brain Pod
[3:07:53] <Hydrapissed> I love the access on those guys to btw
[3:07:58] <Hydrapissed> the description is bat shit insane
[3:08:05] <xeros720> i like how cartoony they are
[3:08:15] <Sokumotanaka> Where's the weird target monster?
[3:08:16] <Liquid_In_Silico> They're annoying af so good...
[3:08:33] <Hydrapissed> does plague have access on? I wana see him read the text on these guys lol
[3:08:36] <Hydrapissed> its nuts
[3:08:59] <TheWe4pon> different char
[3:09:02] <Hydrapissed> awww
[3:09:36] <penitentpentwitch> Now to shotgun 10 hipotions
[3:09:45] <examplez0> Literal whack a mole
[3:09:46] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> NO YOU NEED TO LEARN THE MECHANICS THOUGH!
[3:09:49] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> this game seems to have a lot of unfun fights
[3:10:06] <tokenreefer> brain pods
[3:10:06] <arkv01> barret used his pastor holy healing tech
[3:10:08] <Hydrapissed> but yah anyway those sledge worms if u access them apparently they can bend space time to go threw holes
[3:10:23] <penitentpentwitch> In an attempt to make things 'difficult' in the end game, they made enemies that are 'annoying'
[3:10:25] <arkv01> yeah you had to feed elixirs
[3:10:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> Magic Pot get elixer to give you lots of AP, Movers gave you even more AP because 2 or 3 per fight
[3:10:56] <KVD22> HOLY SHIT A TALKING DOG
[3:10:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> 3 Movers was like 600 AP
[3:11:03] <mrgaster8> how do u think of the dodging in the game
[3:11:17] <penitentpentwitch> Hojo walked 'to the right'
[3:11:25] <tokenreefer> North is progress
[3:11:39] <Sokumotanaka> After all this how are they gonna rationalize letting hojo live on that beach scene?
[3:11:44] <Trinity5> does plague not want the minimap on intentionally?
[3:12:03] <Hydrapissed> yahhh its odd
[3:12:07] <penitentpentwitch> Spam item use out of battle?
[3:12:07] <arkv01> I'd like a mode that lets me play the entire game as a frog
[3:12:10] <arkv01> including cutscenes
[3:12:22] <DaiRyuseii> The first strike materia should help with that
[3:12:36] <Hydrapissed> mana pots all ya need
[3:12:50] <Trinity5> honestly yeah mana pots and phoenix downs
[3:12:57] <MilkingEdge> ghost
[3:12:57] <Hydrapissed> I guess they are there to try and make up for the fact if u dont have a certain ele type maybe?
[3:13:02] <Vaiire> I don't like status ailments in an ARPG anyway since they take control away from the player.
[3:13:05] <Hydrapissed> like fire bombs if u dont have firega or what ever
[3:13:26] <MilkingEdge> big brain
[3:13:51] <Hydrapissed> gata get hit
[3:13:57] <tokenreefer> don't waste atb
[3:13:57] <penitentpentwitch> You have to be hit to trigger counterstance
[3:14:07] <JoeBecomesJoe> If you get hit you do big number
[3:14:13] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Get hit with counterstance and do big damage. Only good thing about that sword
[3:14:27] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Aughh
[3:14:28] <smugfox95> nuhh arghh
[3:14:37] <MilkingEdge> graoning
[3:14:52] <tokenreefer> use barrettes ground punch
[3:14:55] <penitentpentwitch> Hit the one with the 'Davy Jones' head?
[3:15:21] <Sokumotanaka> Dont let Zone find these grunts
[3:15:41] <xeros720> stardust ray, was that a red limit break?
[3:16:12] <Hydrapissed> yah
[3:16:18] <Trinity5> counterstance pretty useful against the turks
[3:16:26] <Jrockoni> that sword actually looks pretty alright
[3:16:27] <xeros720> neat
[3:16:31] <Hydrapissed> parries are always busted lol
[3:16:56] <xeros720> really feels like red is half finished
[3:17:01] <Hydrapissed> also yah did they hype her chamber up at all in the orginal
[3:17:02] <Sokumotanaka> I was about to ask about Tifa and Aerith
[3:17:11] <Hydrapissed> didnt jenova just get yoinked off screen lol
[3:17:25] <arkv01> but then jesus symbolism
[3:17:32] <MilkingEdge> Jerry Springer: Darth you are not the father
[3:17:41] <penitentpentwitch> Funnily, you can cheese Counterstance. If you activate ATB, and see you're about to get hit, you can Choose Counterstance to punish enemies instead.
[3:17:47] <Vaiire> They're making Shinra HQ feel like a sanatorium with all this goddamn padding.
[3:18:03] <xeros720> you saw jenova in a tube, got a creepy look at it in fmv, but then walk off
[3:18:10] <Hydrapissed> yah
[3:18:12] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's okay, now Rey is the bestest Jedi and chosen one
[3:18:17] <Hydrapissed> this is screaming vader syndrom to
[3:18:19] <examplez0> SEPHIROTH SHOWED UP AND I CLAPPED
[3:18:21] <arkv01> this is true
[3:18:22] <Hydrapissed> u just saw her tube nad left lol
[3:18:25] <arkv01> cloud even calls sephiroth daddy
[3:18:27] <Sokumotanaka> yup
[3:18:27] <TheWe4pon> but worse?
[3:18:28] <Hydrapissed> and*
[3:18:29] <tolloponik> I'll say
[3:18:40] <Hydrapissed> also god why the actual one wing
[3:19:25] <spiritofmojave> now everytime Sephiroth is on screen everyone should be asking 'why's he there'
[3:19:28] <gunsrlove> Artwork and writing for entertainment will always be focused on popularity, it has to be
[3:19:33] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> sepiroths entire personality is just the one winged angel theme now and nothing else
[3:19:34] <examplez0> Because it's symbolic of the darkness in Cloud's heart being Sephiroth\
[3:19:41] <penitentpentwitch> Sephiroth's character arc: Further and further Oedipus complex?
[3:19:47] <examplez0> Yes that is an actual thing in Kingdom Hearts
[3:20:02] <Hydrapissed> hes not heavy enough lol
[3:20:06] <+psydaku> morning plague
[3:20:07] <TheWe4pon> was Kingdom Hearts the first thing to show Seph with one wing outside 7?
[3:20:13] <examplez0> Yes
[3:20:20] <gunsrlove> THE HEARTLESS DARK LIGHTNESS???
[3:20:21] <penitentpentwitch> Was it in Advent Children?
[3:20:24] <KVD22> it's the ballas
[3:20:29] <examplez0> Also yes
[3:20:29] <Hydrapissed> that actual one wing thing is dumb as shit
[3:20:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> the one wing in FF7 was hinged to Sephiroth's shoulder socket, it wasn't a back wing like in KH
[3:20:59] <examplez0> I wouldn't hate Advent Children so much if it wasn't so badly written
[3:21:00] <kiwicoffin> They're just chilling at the other phone
[3:21:05] <spiritofmojave> OH NO
[3:21:06] <arkv01> ohnu!
[3:21:10] <Hydrapissed> oh no
[3:21:15] <penitentpentwitch> Advent Children seemed built on spectacle
[3:21:20] <sosandstorm> Ah come on
[3:21:25] <MilkingEdge> Girls just chillin gossiping
[3:21:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Power rangers was my childhood
[3:21:33] <arkv01> I was still a wee lad when morphin rangers was on tv, so I got suckered in LUL
[3:21:33] <Sokumotanaka> The only thing I ike about Advent children were the outfits
[3:21:43] <smugfox95> the two boy guys
[3:22:16] <xeros720> i was 6 or so, so me too
[3:22:17] <Fredcome2bed> LUL
[3:22:18] <MilkingEdge> quality dubbing
[3:22:19] <examplez0> I tried watching the first episode on Netflix and it was so unwatchably bad
[3:22:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> Bulk and Skull... whose actors became real life best friends
[3:22:24] <spiritofmojave> That is perfection
[3:22:26] <tokenreefer> dads gone boyz
[3:22:29] <xeros720> still love the snes game too
[3:22:32] <Sokumotanaka> Why did they do Red13 like that?
[3:22:35] <arkv01> oh my god I just remembered that scene, it was A PLUS LUL
[3:22:49] <MilkingEdge> Tifa Boobhart
[3:23:01] <tokenreefer> dads gone lets look at naked ladies
[3:23:22] <tokenreefer> tifaz knockers
[3:23:35] <arkv01> plague's gone to collect milkies from the sheepsies
[3:23:52] <tokenreefer> milks from tifa

[3:24:54] <BatQuest> Entertainment from insomnia.
[3:24:54] <KVD22> THIS ONE'S FOR YOU MORF
[3:25:01] <DaiRyuseii> You call her Aeris too? Glad to see people of culture still exist.

[3:25:09] <PsychicKirby> 5:35am
[3:25:11] <locobo98> plague of gripes 2020
[3:25:24] <arkv01> whack a mole monsters
[3:25:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> Aeris keeps teetering close to being the princess in Drawn Together
[3:26:05] <DaiRyuseii> This is why turn based combat is better
[3:26:08] <+psydaku> no. time it better.
[3:26:09] <arkv01> ATB interruption feelsBADman
[3:26:11] <jo_vo> Haa Princess CLara
[3:26:23] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Ehh, just need to remember to stun before doing long build up attacks
[3:26:25] <jo_vo> And her Octopussoire or whatever
[3:26:43] <examplez0> Plague finally chose Tifa over Aerith
[3:26:47] <IntrepidEye> In totally unrelated news XCOM snek lady brothels are canon as of the new game
[3:27:03] <TheWe4pon> nice
[3:27:33] <tokenreefer> you almost ded
[3:27:36] <MilkingEdge> Sakter bois
[3:27:47] <PsychicKirby> irritating = challenging
[3:27:51] <tokenreefer> she said see ya later boi
[3:27:52] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Tifa vs Yuri on Ice
[3:27:59] <Trinity5> red'

[3:28:04] <Trinity5> losing health
[3:28:07] <Trinity5> you know how it do
[3:28:49] <arkv01> wishful thinking? Let me crush that for you - nomura
[3:28:56] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> its too bad reds not playable considering hes present in combat so much
[3:29:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:29:46] <penitentpentwitch> Sounds abusable as cloud with counters
[3:29:48] <MilkingEdge> Nomura gameplay
[3:29:55] <+psydaku> but why not just use the provoke materia.
[3:30:08] <PsychicKirby> woolieDATTEBAYO
[3:30:19] <tokenreefer> tifa is pretty badass though
[3:30:22] <xeros720> yeah, provoke works great
[3:30:23] <+crowmium> Umm, excuse me, but your tail is on fire
[3:30:26] <arkv01> that monster lad screamed THANK YOOOU as it fell

[3:31:02] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Quite
[3:31:04] <jo_vo> That's cuz America has 50 states.

[3:31:13] <Sokumotanaka> yup
[3:31:14] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I'll take a nutter butter
[3:31:15] <PsychicKirby> yes
[3:31:17] <%bettysharkface> What is a nutter butter
[3:31:17] <gensoukaizou> nutter butter Kreygasm
[3:31:18] <hellfirejefe> god i love nutter butters
[3:31:18] <doggieo> They are delicious
[3:31:20] <sosandstorm> yeah... eat a fruit instead
[3:31:20] <BatQuest> What's worse are the ones who still won't realize it.
[3:31:21] <TheWe4pon> NUTTER BUTTERS
[3:31:23] <spiritofmojave> Good choice
[3:31:24] <Trinity5> nutter butters are aight
[3:31:24] <tokenreefer> europe < america
[3:31:26] <tolloponik> credits rolled what the fuck?!
[3:31:26] <+KawaiiJetty> they give the nut a good taste
[3:31:28] <+crowmium> Peanut Butter Snacky Wackies
[3:31:28] <Trinity5> you got teddy grahms tho?
[3:31:30] <Eger007> max just finished the game
[3:31:30] <KaiserMario> I nut on nutts, but i've never heard of that one
[3:31:30] <MilkingEdge> Nut
[3:31:32] <xeros720> im all about bad choices and uses of time
[3:31:33] <Ophiuchas> I've heard of them , but American chocolate is pretty gross
[3:31:34] <arkv01> nutter butter for 200 please, alex
[3:31:37] <vonmaultke> No
[3:31:38] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes Max just beat the game and he called it incredible but idk if he means it in a good way yet
[3:31:42] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> We call them :Heart attacks" here
[3:31:44] <DaiRyuseii> Sounds diabetically delicious
[3:31:54] <Sokumotanaka> Unhealthy is the name
[3:31:56] <%bettysharkface> I don't think I've ever had anything like that in Australia
[3:31:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> hershey owns ALL american chocolate
[3:32:03] <+whiskywolfe> American chocolate is dogshit.
[3:32:07] <MilkingEdge> Diabetes dileious
[3:32:15] <%bettysharkface> Closest we might have is something called a Picnic bar.
[3:32:16] <Trinity5> hating chocolate isn't even that weird
[3:32:17] <jiin6> oh um...ok
[3:32:18] <majeser> all.chocolate is bad honestly
[3:32:20] <Trinity5> yeah american chocolate is ass
[3:32:23] <spiritofmojave> American chocolate is like American cheese, horrific
[3:32:24] <+CrimsonDio11> milk chocolate or dark chocolate?
[3:32:31] <theloganbrand> It gets all stuck in your teeth as well
[3:32:33] <+Slaardacity> im interested in where the plot is going after beating it myself tbh
[3:32:37] <Trinity5> american cheese is amazing you shut your mouth
[3:32:38] <jo_vo> A buddy of mine moved to Hungary and he lost 20lbs without really changing his diet. Likely because his food isn't infused with sugar and trans fats
[3:32:39] <+KawaiiJetty> i can't stand american sweets tbh
[3:32:44] <penitentpentwitch> As I've grown older, I've found myself enjoying vanilla more and more
[3:32:52] <KVD22> pasteurized milk
[3:32:57] <$jamarartdoodles> American milk chocolate taste like pure shit
[3:32:57] <Ophiuchas> the first time I was given a Hershey's I thought it had gone off, it has a slight comity smell
[3:32:58] <+UnwoundCaesar70> WHAT
[3:33:02] <Eger007> palm oil is the worst thing ever
[3:33:04] <tolloponik> huh?
[3:33:07] <KVD22> first time I ate american chocolate I thought it had gone bad
[3:33:08] <Ophiuchas> vomit-y*
[3:33:10] <sosuke5> I've tried American bread, it's sweet and awful.
[3:33:11] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> MMM vomit bars
[3:33:16] <kiwicoffin> that bitter acidic flavor?
[3:33:17] <PsychicKirby> It was a mass production decision
[3:33:24] <Futurecity10> diabetic so I have no stake in your chocolate shit throwing
[3:33:27] <KaiserMario> "reverse diaherrea"
[3:33:30] <Hydrapissed> yahh its bad here
[3:33:35] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Are Toberlone made in America
[3:33:37] <sosandstorm> That's Hershey's specifically though
[3:33:40] <sosandstorm> i thought
[3:33:44] <tolloponik> it's kinda bitter
[3:33:44] <penitentpentwitch> Take overseas chocolate in small doses. It can be overpowering.
[3:33:47] <%bettysharkface> I will send you a care package.
[3:33:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> hershey went out of its way to buy OTHER chocolate companies to make THOSE chocolates also vomit
[3:33:50] <sosandstorm> the horrible acidic shit
[3:33:52] <jo_vo> White chocolate is just condensed milk with extra fats
[3:33:58] <xeros720> white choco is essentially cream
[3:34:08] <arkv01> choco ASMR Kreygasm
[3:34:11] <Trinity5> i really do like red's voice here
[3:34:13] <Sokumotanaka> White chocolate is the devil's torture
[3:34:15] <jiin6> more fats
[3:34:16] <availablethor> "american bread" lol, such an european concept. You can buy sour bread in any random Safeway.
[3:34:17] <PsychicKirby> The better American chocolates are like Ghirardelli
[3:34:18] <%JailShmixRemix> :(
[3:34:21] <xeros720> lol
[3:34:28] <Zinax7> man max crying tears of happiness at the ending
[3:34:30] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Does even dark chocolate taste like puke?
[3:34:33] <jiin6> you know it can't, you're in TOO DEEP
[3:34:33] <Zinax7> who would've thunk
[3:34:50] <Ophiuchas> agree with you on peanut butter 😉
[3:34:57] <xeros720> sugar+peanut butter is cheating, i swear
[3:35:04] <+crowmium> Ghirardelli legitimately competes with European chocolate
[3:35:06] <%JailShmixRemix> Of course he won't be, he's too emotional about it
[3:35:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> wonderbread is cake, american chocolate is vomit, american cheese is for making cheeseburgers look photogenic
[3:35:10] <kiwicoffin> I imagine this is the part where you would enjoy playing with Red XIII if it were a thing
[3:35:15] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LULLUL
[3:35:16] <london_flexing> I mean he was crying. he was never critical
[3:35:18] <+EpicureanIguana> he did say he wouldnt care if the rest of the game was floppy dicks hitting his face LUL
[3:35:18] <Hydrapissed> max had fun
[3:35:19] <tolloponik> @PlagueOfGripes it was Magic to him
[3:35:19] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LUL
[3:35:40] <%JailShmixRemix> He had fun and cried, I can respect that
[3:35:44] <Monstergelo> who max?
[3:35:49] <Zinax7> at least someone's happy
[3:35:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> Aeris got better when she got a Kamehameha
[3:35:53] <Trinity5> ray of judgement is pretty good, if you manage to pull it off
[3:35:55] <spiritofmojave> He had fun with what they gave, which fair enough yknow
[3:35:56] <JoeBecomesJoe> Her magic damage is some good shit
[3:35:56] <BurdRightsActivist> Man, I wanted max to HATE IT
[3:35:58] <%JailShmixRemix> Maximillan Dood @Monstergelo
[3:36:04] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes are you going to give the sequels to this a chance or are you done with FF7 Remake after this one
[3:36:05] <sosandstorm> yep, glad Aerith will be with us forever
[3:36:06] <tolloponik> it's the reaction that I feel the devs wanted everyone to have
[3:36:15] <Zinax7> it'd suck that when he plays part 2 and it' just kingdom hearts 4
[3:36:17] <KaiserMario> Asking for Max's opinion on this, is like asking your mom if she thinks you're good-looking...
[3:36:21] <penitentpentwitch> It's hard to hate on his hype
[3:36:22] <+EpicureanIguana> It's ok chat, what matters is that we hate it SeemsGood
[3:36:30] <BurdRightsActivist> I wanted Max to hate it, so I can watch his SOUL leave his BODY. ):
[3:36:30] <sosandstorm> It feels a bit like Plague is putting everyone on blast tonight for some reason
[3:36:32] <%JailShmixRemix> i don't hate it
[3:36:34] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @epicureaniguana lol
[3:36:59] <DaiRyuseii> I can't really stand the remake myself. I just don't like the graphical style despite me loving the original to death
[3:37:02] <spiritofmojave> @epicureaniguana Yep. Just finished it a few hours and holy shit, lotta hope dashed in a couple hours
[3:37:03] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> aerith with all her abilities. becomes tower defense. atb boost plus shield plus doublecast makes jer pretty undamageable and can just spam spells
[3:37:07] <spiritofmojave> *ago
[3:37:08] <Dereh0g> Nostalgia is poison to the mind
[3:37:10] <penitentpentwitch> What was your favorite section(s) of FF7 Original?
[3:37:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> everything that happens to you between 12 and 20 is the most emotional attachment to you, and it's all downhill from there
[3:37:26] <+EpicureanIguana> @spiritofmojave at least the soundtrack was good LUL
[3:37:28] <jo_vo> Comparison is the theft of joy you mean?
[3:37:35] <DaiRyuseii> Nomura
[3:37:35] <Trinity5> okay but where you do you stand on mint ice creme
[3:37:38] <Hydrapissed> was me :)
[3:37:41] <KVD22> tetsuya nomura did
[3:37:43] <%JailShmixRemix> Who cares, ice cream is still ice cream :)
[3:37:47] <spiritofmojave> @epicureaniguana at the very least, made it bearable lmao
[3:38:09] <TheWe4pon> "I happen to like dog shit"
[3:38:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> mint ice cream is like oatmeal raisin, you have to hate yourself to like both
[3:38:21] <kiwicoffin> Gotta switch to the boys
[3:38:22] <tokenreefer> go back to the terminal
[3:38:26] <Trinity5> lp tax
[3:38:29] <Trinity5> it's real
[3:38:36] <Medo3G> open the door for cloud
[3:38:40] <TheWe4pon> switch parties
[3:38:40] <Medo3G> and switch
[3:38:41] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Do switch for door, change char
[3:38:44] <jiin6> i like mint choc tho...fuck you
[3:38:50] <tokenreefer> PHS
[3:38:54] <WaifusSansFrontieres> hello, I desperately need to watch a stream of this game by someone who thinks and is not just how on emotion fumes entertain me you beautiful bald cynical man you
[3:39:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> i hate myself, so i like mint chip
[3:39:09] <DaiRyuseii> Now Trials of Mana or Xenoblade Chronicles's remakes are more faithful to the original styles and I like their visuals more due to that.
[3:39:18] <+EpicureanIguana> LUL
[3:39:26] <jiin6> Xenoblades a remaster tho
[3:39:27] <Trinity5> mint chip is great
[3:39:29] <kiwicoffin> The PS4 framerates do it no favors
[3:39:32] <tokenreefer> tifa is a cutie
[3:39:36] <Trinity5> oatmeal raisin sucks
[3:39:39] <Trinity5> but raisin bran is tight
[3:40:07] <%Samex_Comex> Hojo got his mojo
[3:40:20] <tokenreefer> a cookie 8s a cookie
[3:40:20] <MilkingEdge> Plague nutted on the floor
[3:40:22] <%caramello_man> what idiot came up with the name nutter butter?
[3:40:22] <+rapt0r_lg> fix your bed duuudee
[3:40:24] <Ophiuchas> <3 mint chocolate chip <3
[3:40:24] <xeros720> hojo ruined your nutter butter
[3:40:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> the bran in raisin bran is really good, but getting a sponful of only raisins in the milk is offputting
[3:40:33] <WaifusSansFrontieres> where does this rank on your list of stretch mechanics? you like this stretching more or less than the mecha arms?
[3:40:38] <+KawaiiJetty> love me some crunchy mint
[3:40:41] <gunsrlove> Max has been in a trance for like 20 minutes now LUL
[3:40:49] <tokenreefer> your buttered nutt-erd
[3:40:51] <jiin6> milk and raisins are pure no for me
[3:40:59] <seth45er> Tifa loves some nutter-butters
[3:41:00] <gunsrlove> Max is great but boy his opinion on FF7 is not to be trusted
[3:41:06] <%Samex_Comex> Fuck it up more
[3:41:11] <Trinity5> fuck it up more
[3:41:15] <jiin6> bed looks a lot better than mine

[3:41:24] <Trinity5> lmfaooooooo
[3:41:25] <WaifusSansFrontieres> max is too emotionally invested to think about FF7, it was clear he was gonna love whatever they did
[3:41:29] <xeros720> lol
[3:41:30] <KVD22> forsenKek
[3:41:33] <+KawaiiJetty> bed needs more torture

[3:41:36] <DaiRyuseii> Hahahah if only you knew how bad it gets
[3:41:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague don't read the script LUL

[3:42:30] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[3:42:36] <Hydrapissed> sephiroth as a party member
[3:42:36] <kiwicoffin> You'll probably fight the evil incarnation of Cloud, Cloud Black
[3:42:39] <tolloponik> do you like Dragon Ball Z plague?
[3:42:39] <spiritofmojave> they blew it yet STILL wanna milk it more, which how they don't see the conflict there idk
[3:42:41] <%Samex_Comex> Wait one Sephiroth has one wing and another Sephiroth has the other wing

[3:42:50] <arkv01> tifa's titters were the true evil
[3:42:50] <Medo3G> Do you think they wrote the entire remake saga, or are they writing it part by part?
[3:42:51] <Hasuke> The stupid fucking clones from advent children, that'll be it
[3:42:52] <Hydrapissed> oh no plague
[3:42:53] <kuzokai> HE CRACKED THE CODE

[3:43:13] <Hydrapissed> ZACK and cloud vs SWARMS of sephiroths
[3:43:15] <DaiRyuseii> Sephiroth-Xehanort
[3:43:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> the real twist of Remake will be: Aerith is Jenova, Cloud is Sephiroth
[3:43:16] <Trinity5> instead of the 1000 heartless fight its the 1000 sephiroth fight
[3:43:16] <kiwicoffin> A musou of Sephiroths
[3:43:16] <KVD22> agent smith sephiroth

[3:44:06] <Medo3G> sephiroth the hedgehog
[3:44:09] <waifoong98> that's literally Max in a nutshell heh
[3:44:13] <availablethor> Sephiroth becomes a party member in the final one, and you fight WITH him.
[3:44:16] <%Samex_Comex> Reverse color Sephiroth
[3:44:18] <KaiserMario> I mean... Did you see the roster in Dragon Ball FighterZ? How many Gokus?
[3:44:18] <kingra> SEPHNADO
[3:44:19] <Trinity5> if aerith doesn't die then i'm 1000% seeing this remake as a negative
[3:44:20] <examplez0> IT SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATIONS

[3:46:48] <DaiRyuseii> -THE HEART-
[3:46:49] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes Stop you are making me cringe.
[3:46:50] <%JailShmixRemix> LOL PLAGUE if you're right
[3:46:50] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> you'll fight on the meteor probably
[3:46:53] <Ophiuchas> don't spoil - we're waiting for the reaction
[3:46:55] <examplez0> LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:46:55] <Verdenfert> no it'll literally be the kingdom hearts gate
[3:46:57] <Hydrapissed> CHADLY will throw a rock
[3:46:57] <+UnwoundCaesar70> it's the heart of the Kingdom Hearts
[3:46:59] <JoeBecomesJoe> Thats where ff7 did end
[3:47:00] <%caramello_man> plagueFace
[3:47:01] <kiwicoffin> The black materia is a door VisLaud
[3:47:01] <%JailShmixRemix> LOL LOL LOL LOL
[3:47:05] <Medo3G> into the sephiro-verse
[3:47:07] <kingra> CHADLEY IS A SEPHIROTH CLONE
[3:47:08] <xeros720> i think the cosmic lifestream exists in the EU already
[3:47:09] <arkv01> the entire crew travels to twilight town in KH1 and it all fits snugly into the nomuraverse
[3:47:15] <kingra> IT'S WHY HIS HAIR IS WHITE
[3:47:16] <theloganbrand> Would you like to fight a vr knights of the round?
[3:47:18] <Fredcome2bed> I love how they present content like that family guy bit where the guy shows you pictures of his kids by beating your face with it.
[3:47:20] <jiin6> just like Donald duck
[3:47:22] <Trinity5> it'd be fuckin' tight if they kiil chadley and in the second game bring in bradley
[3:47:26] <DaiRyuseii> SPINNY FISH
[3:47:28] <examplez0> Chadley was the real Sephiroth in disguise the whole time
[3:47:33] <arkv01> SAW 4
[3:47:34] <spiritofmojave> It's the DMC3 fish/worm thing
[3:47:36] <examplez0> Sword Dancer
[3:47:41] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah Sword Dance
[3:47:46] <Xithamas> what if the whole game is just chadleys vr simulation?
[3:47:51] <penitentpentwitch> Assess time?
[3:47:54] <kiwicoffin> Localized for your pleasure
[3:48:01] <Trinity5> gotta eat this nut
[3:48:02] <Trinity5> ter butter
[3:48:03] <Hydrapissed> hes done
[3:48:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> literally every wacky enemy from OG got turned into a boss
[3:48:15] <Hydrapissed> ah k
[3:48:17] <MilkingEdge> SWORDI PEEN
[3:48:17] <Trinity5> okay but did you know that goofy dies in kh2?
[3:48:25] <penitentpentwitch> It's appreciated that you lean back
[3:48:25] <Hydrapissed> ASMR time im cool with it
[3:48:29] <arkv01> eating is ASMR
[3:48:29] <gunsrlove> So how do you talk to Pat then ?
[3:48:41] <Ophiuchas> I do like how they've reimagined the monsters this time round
[3:48:41] <WaifusSansFrontieres> plague I need you to be a force for logic and reason in the life of pat and woolie
[3:48:48] <+KawaiiJetty> Pat will chew louder
[3:48:53] <Trinity5> it's go the zip zap
[3:49:05] <Ophiuchas> loud gulping of water is more annoying
[3:49:07] <arkv01> @WaifusSansFrontieres plague and woolie would overpower pat's insanity and he would shrink into a pebble
[3:49:07] <Handsome0ne> God, you should never hear Pat play live then...
[3:49:11] <Hydrapissed> Flying oh boi.....
[3:49:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:49:52] <kiwicoffin> They've been glorified for nostalgia's sake
[3:49:54] <mxt8420> why is this whiny cunt still playing lmao
[3:49:59] <jo_vo> They should have made that thing smaller
[3:50:00] <kylecoolperson> The boss fights seem like hell in this.
[3:50:03] <jo_vo> ANd more numerous
[3:50:07] <jo_vo> Not bigger and singular
[3:50:10] <arkv01> why didn't they keep the original name for this long boi :(
[3:50:25] <KVD22> DansGame
[3:50:26] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I have spend several days now being told that I am just a purist and only wnated a 1:1 remake and should stop being so negative and let people enjoy the game
[3:50:26] <Trinity5> honestly you throw down an arcane ward and blast him with a -ga spell
[3:50:30] <Trinity5> done deal
[3:50:52] <+azure22900> tbh the weird ones with this battle system seem to work better as a boss fight rather than common enemy, imagine having to fight this as a common enemy you'd get pissed off after the 3rd fight.
[3:50:55] <SilverRoddo> Look at this Mega Man X enemy.
[3:50:59] <WaifusSansFrontieres> to which I have to point out if me pointing out issues with the story impacts your enjoyment of the story, that means your enjoymen is dependant on you being able to ignore issues, which is not good
[3:51:05] <jo_vo> Sword Dance was so much cooler
[3:51:14] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i dont think changing it was the problem, id be fine if it didnt have so many problems and a marketing campaign that mislead people
[3:51:17] <jo_vo> Swordipede just sounds descriptive
[3:51:31] <Hydrapissed> I DID that to every time lol
[3:51:34] <Hydrapissed> Morph lol
[3:51:41] <Ophiuchas> @waifussansfrontieres well that's what I expected when they said remake but well what do I know
[3:51:45] <Trinity5> i def did not lock on for this fight
[3:51:46] <%JailShmixRemix> TBH, I love FF7R just for all the dumb people and shit that has come out of it LUL
[3:51:49] <WaifusSansFrontieres> listen changes are fine, putting in leslie ad novel characters is fine, tkaing only the non gackt bits from crisis core is fine, kngdom hearts time travel ghosts are not fine
[3:52:02] <+UnwoundCaesar70> YOU TO CLOSE MON
[3:52:13] <+CrimsonDio11> @Ophiuchas they said from the beginning that this wasnt going to be a 1:1 recreation
[3:52:15] <KaiserMario> Hey! Don't choke Wyclef!
[3:52:25] <arkv01> so plague was the machete guy woolie met in grenada...
[3:52:26] <Hydrapissed> GOT EM tifa
[3:52:35] <%JailShmixRemix> People cant criticize the game at all LUL
[3:52:40] <WaifusSansFrontieres> there is several kilometers of wiggle room between a 1:1 remake and inserting the multiverse theory into it
[3:52:52] <Trinity5> let red be a good boi SwiftRage
[3:53:12] <jo_vo> 1:1 would be impossible because of the scope. Like, the cameras thing needed some explanation when they were coming in the tower, because charging in to storm the castle would be suicide.
[3:53:27] <Trinity5> so would you say Roche doesn't work at all
[3:53:33] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[3:53:33] <Trinity5> cause as lame as he is
[3:53:38] <MilkingEdge> HOJO CLIMAXING
[3:53:41] <Trinity5> i thought he was pretty good
[3:53:41] <KVD22> I hear the jenova theme I know what that is
[3:53:43] <Hydrapissed> Remebmer that part btw plague
[3:53:44] <Hydrapissed> for later
[3:53:46] <Hydrapissed> just sayin
[3:53:48] <DaiRyuseii> TAKE A NOTE OF CLOUD STRUGGLING HERE TO OPEN A DOOR
[3:54:04] <kingra> Kappa
[3:54:05] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @JailShmixRemix yes any negative critique towards the game, in my experience has been shut down by a mob of very emotionally based fans
[3:54:08] <+illoonar> Kappa
[3:54:09] <Trinity5> cloud using the buster sword to whack against a door got me pretty good lmao
[3:54:12] <spiritofmojave> 99 Sephiroths on Mars
[3:54:12] <jiin6> flying drones?
[3:54:12] <tolloponik> Oh BOY
[3:54:14] <WaifusSansFrontieres> not a lot of logical arguements to be found though
[3:54:16] <xeros720> sephiroth took a solid hour to get jenova out of that tube
[3:54:20] <kiwicoffin> Space Sephiroth lol
[3:54:29] <jo_vo> UnSafer Sephiroth
[3:54:35] <kingra> 37 SEPHIROTHS ON SATURN
[3:54:40] <Vaiire> You mean like a skyscraper, Plague?
[3:54:43] <Ophiuchas> @crimsondio11 ya I admit I wasn't following the news on the subject as I never really asked or wanted a remake. and I thought they'd expand on a lot of things but well.. the ending.. wasn't for me 😅
[3:54:44] <kuzokai> yeah...
[3:54:46] <Hydrapissed> SEPHIROTH VOLTRON
[3:54:54] <jo_vo> The ship
[3:54:56] <Trinity5> honestly, the amount of doors blocking progress and the 5 ft tall ladders cloud has to climb is baffling lol
[3:54:59] <xeros720> yup
[3:55:03] <ellis4432> the hell house was ligit hell
[3:55:04] <%bettysharkface> Can you pet that dog?
[3:55:06] <WaifusSansFrontieres> well as several people have told me, there was no other way to do this, people have adamantly argued this to me
[3:55:11] <Trinity5> like, cloud can cut through buildings, he can't cut through the door?
[3:55:15] <kiwicoffin> Nomura has no interest in just kissing the tip Plague
[3:55:16] <+croxeye> did he already beat this? or is he still playing through it?
[3:55:23] <tolloponik> majin Sepheroth at max power
[3:55:23] <Hydrapissed> he dont kiss no tips
[3:55:23] <MilkingEdge> !uptime
[3:55:23] <@Nightbot> 3 hours 55 minutes 35 seconds
[3:55:25] <DaiRyuseii> 40k with 20 Primarch Sephiroths and the Sephiroth Emperor of Sephirothkind
[3:55:26] <smugfox95> But you gotta have darth sephiroth
[3:55:31] <jo_vo> Ugh, this game needs a machete cut of it's storyline
[3:55:31] <Hydrapissed> HE GRABS the BALLS
[3:55:37] <+CrimsonDio11> @Ophiuchas thats understandable I didnt expect it to be this huge change but Im intrigued on where it goes more than anything
[3:55:52] <Hydrapissed> yep
[3:55:59] <WaifusSansFrontieres> no plague, then people would ask "where is sephiroth"
[3:56:05] <DaiRyuseii> They ruined the mystery of Sephiroth and what made him an interesting antagonist early on
[3:56:05] <+azure22900> Well isn't that whats happening now? Save Aerith, maybe punch Shinra President in the face and evac?
[3:56:14] <Hydrapissed> where is da sephwioth
[3:56:14] <SilverRoddo> The meteor tho.
[3:56:27] <arkv01> nomura MUST cream before we do
[3:56:30] <gunsrlove> It was never going to be that @PlagueOfGripes , it's too well known to be that.
[3:56:41] <KaiserMario> I really hate their excuse of "but everybody knows Sephiroth, so there's no point in saving him for later" kinda thing...
[3:56:49] <WaifusSansFrontieres> listen people have taken hard stances and chosen hills to die on saying that "because everyone already knows sephiroth its totally fine to just parade him like a mascott"
[3:57:01] <MilkingEdge> AVALANCHE BAND
[3:57:07] <jo_vo> She knows the future
[3:57:08] <+illoonar> I fucking love hearing Plague talk, it's insane. <3
[3:57:12] <Hydrapissed> I mean I guess technically she would be as well cause of how cloud is acting
[3:57:15] <KaiserMario> @WaifusSansFrontieres LUL echo there
[3:57:21] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> no, they moved barret out of the group, how could they
[3:57:22] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @KaiserMario exactly that, its so aggrevating, no one thinks about this as a story
[3:57:23] <spiritofmojave> Yeah I hated that too
[3:57:27] <+azure22900> holy shit lvl 50 already
[3:57:28] <spiritofmojave> it just kicks him out
[3:57:32] <xeros720> aeris kind of treats him like a child i feel
[3:57:35] <DaiRyuseii> Despite me loving FF7, I hate all the fanboying and crap this remake gets, its not that good
[3:57:53] <TheWe4pon> player choice, in this game.
[3:57:57] <TheWe4pon> ha
[3:58:00] <Trinity5> i definitely would've been perfectly fine not seeing sephiroth until the end of this game
[3:58:04] <Trinity5> which is how it should've been'
[3:58:20] <jo_vo> It's got that Squenix money and polish, but MAN does it lean heavy on the original. It's a companion piece.
[3:58:20] <kiwicoffin> This is a game for a modern age and it shows in the beats and rhythm of the story
[3:58:21] <KaiserMario> I mean, Advent Children is trash, nut at least the Sephiroth build up and reveal there are very good
[3:58:58] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PlagueOfGripes how did you like them doing the walk into fire in the first hour of the game
[3:59:08] <%Samex_Comex> Purple stuff
[3:59:14] <Ophiuchas> @crimsondio11 intrigued is the right word, but I'm now of the mind: well if you want to go down this route you better commit, and things that should happen don't and they better not half arse it
[3:59:23] <MilkingEdge> JENOVA JUICE
[3:59:25] <jo_vo> Jenova blew outta that thing like a bat out of hell
[3:59:28] <DaiRyuseii> >Removed the trail of blood for freaking purple drank
[3:59:32] <+EpicureanIguana> what's actually sad is the way Sephiroth gets introduced to new players. They wont get the wank material and will just be confused af
[3:59:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> but then who was sord in shinra
[3:59:46] <+EpicureanIguana> i'd like to know what someone new to the franchise got out of the story
[4:00:03] <jo_vo> Seph's sword was recovered in the cover-up, no?
[4:00:04] <WaifusSansFrontieres> yes plague but sephiroth carrying around a corpse is a good visual
[4:00:04] <penitentpentwitch> Wasn't it implied Sephiorth 'possessed' Jenova's body?
[4:00:10] <WaifusSansFrontieres> and blood trails are good visuals
[4:00:13] <DaiRyuseii> That was legit scary to me as a kid with the Trail of Blood theme in the background
[4:00:19] <arkv01> its shark week, tough times
[4:00:21] <xeros720> jenova juice
[4:00:29] <MilkingEdge> WHAT'S THAT SMELL IT'S BLUUD
[4:00:32] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes the reason it leaves this version of blood because if it was regular blood this game would instantly be rated M
[4:00:35] <kuzokai> tis only a flesh wound
[4:00:44] <Trinity5> "be warned, this is hard progress cloud"
[4:00:46] <+croxeye> @EpicureanIguana same, i would especially love to see what they think of the ending to this game without having the context of the OG FF7
[4:00:51] <WaifusSansFrontieres> ok this is the 3rd time there was no turning back
[4:00:51] <penitentpentwitch> I prefer bluntness here over 'whoops' missed a turn
[4:00:51] <spiritofmojave> NOWS THE TIME FOR PROMPT
[4:00:57] <+KawaiiJetty> Once you get inside, you can't pull out
[4:00:58] <rdddy> omfg that was horribler
[4:00:59] <arkv01> thank you red, I will check my sidequest menu
[4:01:06] <jo_vo> Shinra shows up after Nibelheim burns, sweeps the town, rebuilds, bandages up the reactor and takes Seph's sword? I could see Shinra keeping it in his office.
[4:01:31] <@PeachSaliva> Eli I sent u a spider
[4:01:37] <WaifusSansFrontieres> oh yeah its shit isn't it?
[4:01:40] <jo_vo> Hey Paige
[4:01:42] <jo_vo> Err Peach
[4:01:47] <MilkingEdge> Paige
[4:01:48] <+KawaiiJetty> Spider Paige
[4:01:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> yo paige
[4:01:52] <arkv01> this track is fantastic though
[4:01:54] <WaifusSansFrontieres> but damn us we are just being negative purists who want a 1:1 and hate on everything
[4:01:56] <TheWe4pon> pig paige
[4:01:59] <spiritofmojave> Paige!
[4:02:02] <arkv01> it's an HD rendition without too much remix fuckery
[4:02:03] <tokenreefer> whaddup dog
[4:02:04] <jiin6> Paige sending death spiders?
[4:02:04] <nexusj13> Max just finished this and he's gushing over the stupid new shit
[4:02:07] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> FFVIIR is absolutely a companion piece/alt story that benefits a lot from playing the original. I'm surprised Squeenix didn't bundle this with a remaster.
[4:02:15] <mxt8420> head to the roof you whiny cnt
[4:02:16] <Trinity5> W H A T
[4:02:16] <arkv01> ScaredyCat
[4:02:17] <Hydrapissed> always with the porn
[4:02:19] <spiritofmojave> oh my
[4:02:22] <@PeachSaliva> I take it Plague does not like what is occurring?
[4:02:22] <Ophiuchas> as soon as the really important points of the game were released so early I knew that they were clearing the way for a different story
[4:02:23] <kiwicoffin> that's very specific
[4:02:24] <Hydrapissed> lol
[4:02:27] <mxt8420> stop whining keep going
[4:02:28] <WaifusSansFrontieres> of course max is gushing over the new shit
[4:02:28] <@PeachSaliva> I diiid

[4:02:37] <DaiRyuseii> HAH
[4:02:39] <EcoFreak07> This remake is just a testament to never allowing Nomura have any input in a storyline..... as if KH wasnt enough already
[4:02:41] <@PeachSaliva> oh my god

[4:03:50] <+EpicureanIguana> I wouldnt have an issue with the new shit if it didnt suck ass LUL
[4:03:51] <SilverRoddo> Destiny is destiny.
[4:04:02] <MilkingEdge> Shadow sephiroth
[4:04:05] <+KawaiiJetty> the best muffet art is still the one with Rom
[4:04:09] <Hydrapissed> thats how women walk plague
[4:04:09] <arkv01> its tough to walk on 3 tentacles
[4:04:12] <DaiRyuseii> Did you even get captured by Shinra in this game?
[4:04:13] <MilkingEdge> DRUNK ON MAKO
[4:04:17] <penitentpentwitch> Nice foreshadowing there
[4:04:17] <@PeachSaliva> Plague he’s an alcoholic man
[4:04:23] <Vaiire> Plague, it was the time ghosts.
[4:04:29] <Vaiire> They put the bloodstuffs there.
[4:04:32] <jo_vo> Yeah he's drunk, drunk with power
[4:04:53] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes Max didnt like the plot ghosts
[4:04:54] <jo_vo> Be a contrarian, go up the other stairs
[4:05:02] <KaiserMario> Man, I have to say this is the worst looking sword Cloud has...
[4:05:06] <jo_vo> Yes
[4:05:07] <jo_vo> Thank you
[4:05:12] <DaiRyuseii> Where are the dead bodies?
[4:05:13] <shevan123> is it bad that i still dont know jack shit about sephiroth since the first game came out?
[4:05:33] <@PeachSaliva> Listen
[4:05:44] <+KawaiiJetty> All you need to know about Sephiroth: he uses a lot of shampoo
[4:05:51] <+EpicureanIguana> hyper realistic graphics with cartoon blood ResidentSleeper
[4:05:51] <jo_vo> Listen as best I can read
[4:05:57] <penitentpentwitch> He jumped through the window?

[4:07:15] <+OnTheDonner> Mike Stoklasa: "IT BROKE NEW GROUND!!!"
[4:07:16] <MilkingEdge> SHINRA
[4:07:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> long live the king
[4:07:21] <jo_vo> He doesn't have a squeaky voice
[4:07:21] <penitentpentwitch> So he was thrown out the window, broke the railing, then grabbed the side
[4:07:22] <+KawaiiJetty> why would you help
[4:07:25] <theloganbrand> Palmer is rounder

[4:08:02] <jiin6> edgey blood
[4:08:02] <sosandstorm> He's so strong holy shit
[4:08:07] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> it was just a body in fhe way
[4:08:08] <%JailShmixRemix> FF7R seems far to directed to people who have already played a loved FF7
[4:08:09] <penitentpentwitch> Hojo was bad mouthing President Shinra to JENOVA?
[4:08:11] <theloganbrand> It was bored of being in a shinra cage
[4:08:16] <SilverRoddo> Beefy boi
[4:08:20] <@PeachSaliva> Hey @mxt8420 we get it

[4:08:53] <Ophiuchas> see now what was the point of this scene
[4:08:57] <+crowmium> I mean taking him has a prisoner for interrogation would be way better
[4:09:04] <rdddy> @mxt8420 shut up donkey
[4:09:08] <+OnTheDonner> @jailshmixremix Sephiroth is just some dude that does bad stuff apparently to someone who's only played the remake
[4:09:10] <kiwicoffin> Barret has constantly failed to accomplish anything
[4:09:14] <jo_vo> Ooooh boy, someone is tilted by criticism. So fragile.
[4:09:16] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @mxt8420 somebody wants attention, huh?
[4:09:17] <Daskolin> YEYEYE GEt em PAIGE!
[4:09:27] <+UnwoundCaesar70> He was big mad
[4:09:31] <@PeachSaliva> Sorry, it was the spamming.
[4:09:32] <shevan123> god barret you lovable oaf
[4:09:36] <jiin6> Barret: and also an island
[4:09:41] <jo_vo> She's doing a good job is what she's doing
[4:09:44] <silenthillbookofmammaries> WHITE GUN VS BLACK GUN
[4:09:45] <+KawaiiJetty> glad Barret is still stupid. gotta have some flaw into him
[4:09:47] <KaiserMario> Baby came over to bitch and moan
[4:09:48] <jiin6> oh no one gun
[4:09:49] <Hydrapissed> D: A GOLDEN GUN
[4:09:53] <+OnTheDonner> "He's got a gun!!"

[4:09:57] <shevan123> you goober barret why
[4:09:57] <@PeachSaliva> I’m holding my teddy bear :3
[4:09:59] <+azure22900> Golden gun rules
[4:10:05] <+OnTheDonner> "You idiots.. we've ALL got guns!"
[4:10:06] <jo_vo> That's what I call heavily armed
[4:10:06] <mrgaster8> skullface? va
[4:10:06] <Trinity5> white man holding a black man at gun point, my how times have not changed
[4:10:08] <%bettysharkface> @PeachSaliva Pat?
[4:10:10] <jiin6> yes he would
[4:10:11] <theloganbrand> That's a cutscene gun though
[4:10:12] <smugfox95> AS if barrett hasnt been shot a hundred times already
[4:10:15] <arkv01> might be a materia spellgun
[4:10:16] <WaifusSansFrontieres> the plot ghosts make no sense in what they do and what they want
[4:10:17] <tokenreefer> shoulda deleted him
[4:10:19] <jo_vo> Seriously, a gold gun would be fucking heavy
[4:10:28] <WaifusSansFrontieres> like the ghosts should be here right now
[4:10:31] <+KawaiiJetty> @theloganbrand the strongest type
[4:10:31] <%JailShmixRemix> As a stand alone game a really do think FF7R is really lacking
[4:10:37] <WaifusSansFrontieres> the ghosts should have stabbed shinra at this point
[4:10:45] <jiin6> Shinra: i'm EVVVVIIIIL
[4:10:48] <kiwicoffin> The ghosts pick and choose the story beats
[4:10:51] <JoeBecomesJoe> Hohoho, I'm so evil
[4:10:51] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> the plot ghosts are just the in game representation of FFVII purists, lol
[4:10:55] <jo_vo> I bet money "Seph" comes outta nowhere and impales the dude a la Aerith
[4:10:55] <@PeachSaliva> Bad man is bad
[4:10:57] <kiwicoffin> Because they know the script
[4:10:57] <jo_vo> YUP
[4:10:58] <spiritofmojave> of course
[4:10:59] <sosandstorm> Oh no...
[4:10:59] <TheWe4pon> wat
[4:11:01] <tokenreefer> he ded
[4:11:01] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @kiwicoffin thats the issue
[4:11:03] <+crowmium> TIME SEPHIROTH
[4:11:03] <+OnTheDonner> Censorship dust
[4:11:03] <penitentpentwitch> The legendary sword of plot death
[4:11:05] <MilkingEdge> Stabby stabby
[4:11:06] <sosandstorm> WHAT
[4:11:07] <seth45er> ghost sword!
[4:11:07] <shevan123> that should jenova
[4:11:10] <sosandstorm> Why is he mad?
[4:11:11] <+EpicureanIguana> oh no no no PepeLaugh
[4:11:14] <+KawaiiJetty> That was a ghost sword
[4:11:18] <GilliamYaeger> It's because JENOVA overheard how President Shinra wanted to drain the Promised Land of mako. It feeds off mako. So when it heard that Shinra was going to take it's food, it broke out and killed him.
[4:11:18] <Trinity5> he remember when plague was talking about fighting jenova
[4:11:19] <sosandstorm> WHAT?
[4:11:20] <jo_vo> Wait, what now?
[4:11:21] <+KawaiiJetty> i saw it DansGame
[4:11:24] <WaifusSansFrontieres> like why do the ghosts hate this? shinra dying is right so why do the ghosts hate this?
[4:11:25] <rdddy> yep he just randomly manifested like in a shitty horror movie
[4:11:26] <jo_vo> Excuse me?
[4:11:28] <tokenreefer> lose his other arm
[4:11:29] <arkv01> walk it off, barret

[4:11:56] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> just Phoenix down
[4:11:57] <+crowmium> Does that mean TIME SEPHIROTH can't kill anyone?
[4:11:59] <@PeachSaliva> Have aerith pray on him or whatever
[4:12:00] <sosandstorm> i can't fucking believe how hamfisted this is
[4:12:03] <+OnTheDonner> Except when they don't and let Wedge live
[4:12:06] <Trinity5> HEY GET READY FOR JENOVA
[4:12:08] <BrachyZoid> Unclear
[4:12:10] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I just cant wrap my head around how an army of streammers will clap at and praise the idea of these time ghosts
[4:12:18] <Hydrapissed> lol
[4:12:19] <jo_vo> Oh, that was def a Jenova illusion
[4:12:20] <tokenreefer> hug your daughter with two gun arms
[4:12:26] <Ekaelis> So Barret can sit this boss fight out
[4:12:29] <shevan123> okay goor
[4:12:31] <Hydrapissed> SourPls
[4:12:36] <jo_vo> Good call, Plague
[4:12:39] <mrgaster8> the thing?
[4:12:41] <jo_vo> Nomura was listening
[4:12:43] <sosandstorm> Woah we're in DMC5
[4:12:44] <rdddy> its a tentacle porn illusion
[4:12:53] <+OnTheDonner> Hold onto your butts Plague. you're about to enter a world of fuck
[4:12:54] <penitentpentwitch> Assess time?
[4:12:54] <+croxeye> plague you haven't even gotten to the best bits tho XD
[4:12:56] <+spacehouse> Now Future Barret is gonna bring stabbed Barret into the future to get Norted
[4:12:57] <@PeachSaliva> Welp there’s definitely porn of this
[4:12:57] <spiritofmojave> this really is the Urizen throne place
[4:12:59] <+KawaiiJetty> surprised they showed this fight in trailers uh
[4:13:02] <tokenreefer> is all an allegory
[4:13:06] <sosandstorm> ah, that's why you couldn't pick Barrett
[4:13:06] <GilliamYaeger> Barret got stabbed because otherwise you'd have four party members and that's a no-no
[4:13:10] <jiin6> if you know Nomura you can predict his Juice Flow
[4:13:10] <MilkingEdge> Jenova porn
[4:13:12] <@DCN2049> You guys be nice now. I come back again, it's zero tolerance
[4:13:12] <silenthillbookofmammaries> welcome to fuckin metroid prime apparently
[4:13:14] <TheWe4pon> better be porn
[4:13:14] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PlagueOfGripes barret had to temporarily die so the game doesnt have to give you a partymember selection menu
[4:13:16] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> ah the typical jrpg doujin boss
[4:13:17] <jo_vo> If there's not porn of it yet, there will be soon.
[4:13:21] <Hydrapissed> pc release is gana have a HAY DAY with this game
[4:13:23] <Trinity5> @KawaiiJetty honestly with how many times marketing has a fucked a game over, i'm not really lol
[4:13:24] <xeros720> japan trailers give no fucks
[4:13:27] <%Samex_Comex> Oh dream weaver, I believe you can get me through the night!
[4:13:27] <+CrimsonDio11> @WaifusSansFrontieres what streamers are you watching not one streamer I have seen has praised the ghosts
[4:13:31] <BrachyZoid> All things considered
[4:13:42] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @CrimsonDio11 Pat, Woolie, Max
[4:13:46] <jo_vo> Imagine skull-banging Jenova's actual skull
[4:13:48] <Trinity5> jenova dreamweaver sounds like a sick band name btw
[4:13:49] <+crowmium> Are there doujins of Jenova tentacle'ing the girls? Asking for a friend.
[4:13:51] <rdddy> sounds like a shitty WoW 5 man dungeon boss
[4:13:53] <+KawaiiJetty> @Trinity5 yeah true...
[4:13:56] <jo_vo> There's even a mouth cavity
[4:13:59] <kiwicoffin> Jenova is a pokemon
[4:14:02] <DaiRyuseii> This game is a fucking hallucination
[4:14:02] <+EpicureanIguana> lidl Nashandra LUL
[4:14:03] <arkv01> ah yes, jenova dreamweaver the scourge of mid 2000s newgrounds
[4:14:04] <+CrimsonDio11> idk about woolie and pat but Max straight up said he didnt like the ghosts
[4:14:09] <Hydrapissed> its nomuras excuse
[4:14:09] <sosandstorm> "You'll wake up and this game will all have been a dream"
[4:14:11] <Hydrapissed> hes ace in the hole
[4:14:12] <MilkingEdge> Jenova high on that kush
[4:14:18] <jo_vo> This game is a fever dream at this point
[4:14:24] <jiin6> Jenova Juices are a category 10 on nomura juices
[4:14:25] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @CrimsonDio11 have you seen maxs current stream? he is gushing and crying about this game
[4:14:27] <majeser> was that ever a power of jenova? I can't remember.
[4:14:27] <sosuke5> Woolie and Pat haven't reached the end yet
[4:14:28] <+croxeye> also does anybody else feel that the in-game cutscenes look better than the pre-rendered ones?
[4:14:36] <+OnTheDonner> @crimsondio11 Max was crying during the credits cause he thought it was amazing
[4:14:37] <+KawaiiJetty> now i am guessing how the ship fight with Jenova is gonna play out NotLikeThis
[4:14:50] <%bettysharkface> Everyone has everything, we're all holding hands, and it, is, fine.
[4:15:00] <availablethor> Plague enough, the whole game is CG. NotLikeThis
[4:15:04] <%caramello_man> plagueGripes
[4:15:04] <Trinity5> @croxeye i think it's because you're so used to the ingame cutscenes that seeing the cgi just hits you a little weird
[4:15:04] <+croxeye> Pat's in chapter 14
[4:15:06] <Daskolin> psaSmug
[4:15:08] <jo_vo> Will they even keep the Junon ship thing intact in any way at this point?
[4:15:09] <+azure22900> Nah side quests before shinra
[4:15:13] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> dammit bart whyd you die with the materia you nonce
[4:15:14] <WaifusSansFrontieres> yes but on the podcast he praised the ghost idea and the game being evangelion rebuild
[4:15:15] <Hydrapissed> pat died
[4:15:17] <@PeachSaliva> He’s pretty far behind you
[4:15:18] <WaifusSansFrontieres> maybe its gonna change idk
[4:15:22] <spiritofmojave> he hasn't journeyed to Shinra Tower yet even
[4:15:23] <tokenreefer> sephiroth is like watching jojo part 3 without 1 and 2
[4:15:27] <jiin6> Pat's always in the sewers...no wait
[4:15:27] <penitentpentwitch> Pat is stitching together the Plate gameplay, because twitch died and lost the footage
[4:15:43] <Trinity5> pat did say he was interested in what was going to happen and was down for it, unless it sucked
[4:15:45] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes You skipped half a week and you're still beating Pat's progress
[4:15:47] <Trinity5> so there you go lol
[4:15:54] <+justianxix> Just got here, when did Plague start streaming? and where did he start in the game?
[4:16:00] <availablethor> Pat is after the plate falls. He found Wedge.
[4:16:06] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Plague also streams longer though
[4:16:07] <Hydrapissed> 4 hours @justianxix
[4:16:11] <+OnTheDonner> You can dodge the time stop, btw
[4:16:11] <+CrimsonDio11> I literally heard max say "I dont like the plot ghosts"
[4:16:14] <+crowmium> It's FF14 all over again
[4:16:15] <tokenreefer> pats also playing 3 other games
[4:16:17] <sosandstorm> @tokenreefer you can totally do that, you lose like, a bit of context on just how bad dio is, it's more like watching part 4 without 3
[4:16:19] <Eger007> it's a wow fight
[4:16:22] <Sokumotanaka> It looking like that makes my skin crawl
[4:16:25] <Ophiuchas> well nows a good time to use aeris's ability
[4:16:29] <Trinity5> he says that now
[4:16:31] <MilkingEdge> !uptime
[4:16:31] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 16 minutes 43 seconds
[4:16:35] <WaifusSansFrontieres> oh yeah wedge, I love how he gets hit by the debris, and then wind sup in a underground glass cage several miles away from where the debris fell on him
[4:16:40] <Trinity5> tbf i thought this boss was fine, fighting it
[4:17:10] <availablethor> Maybe he walked there in a delirious state then collapsed.
[4:17:10] <Trinity5> what are the rules on t rated game with blood btw, i would've liked jessie and biggs to be a little more fucked up than they were
[4:17:21] <+KawaiiJetty> i still wish you had some sort of controls with the AI partners
[4:17:27] <arkv01> WEW
[4:17:28] <jo_vo> They really go to some lengths to hide blood in this game
[4:17:30] <KaiserMario> Honestly, this game doesn't have many major problems, but the real issue is that future installments will be DUMB AF
[4:17:30] <WaifusSansFrontieres> I like how all the AI partners will just eat AOEs
[4:17:31] <+OnTheDonner> @waifussansfrontieres It's fine, the time ghosts dug a hole for him
[4:17:39] <%bettysharkface> Das a big boy
[4:17:40] <xeros720> our beautiful boy
[4:17:40] <Hydrapissed> scalies unite
[4:17:48] <tokenreefer> @sosandstorm i did that lol. watched the 90s version then part 3,4,5 and decided i should watch 1 and 2 lol
[4:17:48] <jo_vo> I mean, Seph's sword was smoking to cover up any wounds in Shinra and BArret
[4:17:53] <Hydrapissed> SourPls
[4:18:00] <seth45er> YOU DID THE THING!!
[4:18:06] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> yo what how do you get bahamut
[4:18:07] <+azure22900> Well didn't know he was unlockable bugger, wanted that.
[4:18:08] <BillieNoMates> So why arent the time ghosts fighting Jenova here?
[4:18:09] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @OnTheDonner and some people will unironically say that and tell you thats a good explanation and be completely deaf to how thats bad writing because of da emotions
[4:18:12] <Trinity5> @BlueEyesWhiteFatass vr missions
[4:18:23] <Trinity5> YES TIFA
[4:18:27] <Hydrapissed> she trained to fight eldrch horros
[4:18:28] <Trinity5> THIS, YOU TRAINED FOR
[4:18:30] <jo_vo> Specifically for this
[4:18:35] <spiritofmojave> That Jenova mastery LUL
[4:18:37] <jiin6> Tifa Trained against the DrUGS
[4:18:37] <sosandstorm> @tokenreefer yeah it always feels like 1 and 2 are one thing, then 3 onwards is a whole nother with the same characters
[4:18:39] <Trinity5> zangan must have been a badass holy shit
[4:18:41] <jo_vo> SHe has a tentacle effigy in her back room
[4:18:45] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> its 6:30 am and we're all just waiting to see eli flip shit together
[4:18:50] <arkv01> trained for these cosmic horrors
[4:19:00] <MilkingEdge> Tifa hentai doujin trained her
[4:19:12] <jo_vo> I've seen enough tentacle porn...
[4:19:13] <kiwicoffin> hentai intensifies
[4:19:15] <jiin6> time for hentai
[4:19:16] <jo_vo> To know where this is going
[4:19:18] <+CrimsonDio11> @fillmydarksoulwithlight my thoughs exactly
[4:19:21] <shevan123> hmm
[4:19:22] <WaifusSansFrontieres> plague I expect a thorough reviewand analysis of this game
[4:19:24] <+CrimsonDio11> thoughts*
[4:19:30] <Sokumotanaka> Red look sick
[4:19:32] <Hydrapissed> simba GO
[4:19:36] <xeros720> tentacle time
[4:19:38] <smugfox95> IMMUNE LUL
[4:19:40] <jo_vo> XIII Gon give it to ya!
[4:19:40] <Eger007> immune
[4:19:41] <arkv01> wait no red what are you doing
[4:19:42] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> red nooooo
[4:19:42] <jiin6> RED SLAM DUNK
[4:19:44] <MilkingEdge> IMMUNE
[4:19:46] <%bettysharkface> Yaaaay
[4:19:54] <theloganbrand> There's nothing in the rulebook that says Nanaki can't play basketball
[4:20:06] <tokenreefer> @sosandstorm i always tell people to start with part 3 so they would follow through with the show
[4:20:10] <@PeachSaliva> I love Red
[4:20:17] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> good job bahamut
[4:20:21] <Hydrapissed> Triple slash is great on the tentacles
[4:20:27] <JoeBecomesJoe> Tripple slash or whatever was fun with these tentacles
[4:20:30] <penitentpentwitch> Usual boss gag, kill adds to make boss vulnerable
[4:20:31] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Red is good. He is a good boy
[4:20:32] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> theres an image floating around from the old tifa flash but instead of a dick being the focal point its just a butterfinger
[4:20:38] <WaifusSansFrontieres> legit I didnt figure out this phase, eventually it just died, not sure what I had to do
[4:20:40] <tokenreefer> @sosandstorm in my opinion part 3 is superior
[4:20:40] <Sokumotanaka> Should've summoned fat chocobo
[4:20:49] <sosuke5> FF15 Bahamut is coolest Bahamut. But he's also a huge asshole.
[4:20:50] <jo_vo> Oh wow
[4:20:51] <gnollAUS> Throws nuke "Immune"
[4:21:03] <Trinity5> sorcerous storm is pretty good
[4:21:06] <+OnTheDonner> @waifussansfrontieres Just kill the tentacles whenever they show up
[4:21:09] <@PeachSaliva> But is he immune to the power of friendship?
[4:21:13] <Trinity5> same with barret's groundpound aoe
[4:21:17] <Hydrapissed> no one is peach
[4:21:19] <Hydrapissed> no one is
[4:21:20] <jo_vo> I believe in a thing called Love
[4:21:23] <sosandstorm> @tokenreefer 3 is probably the best, 2 I have a soft spot for but that's mostly because of young joseph
[4:21:26] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @OnTheDonner but then jenova enters counter/reflect state
[4:21:27] <+EpicureanIguana> this is such a shitty boss fight
[4:21:29] <arkv01> I don't think jenova would escape unscathed if barret did a divekick
[4:21:31] <@Nightbot> @Ophiuchas -> Nightbot one, bad guys zero. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:21:31] <tokenreefer> @peachsaliva with thier powers combined
[4:21:37] <@PeachSaliva> Isn’t Barret just like, bleeding to death over to the right?
[4:21:37] <spiritofmojave> imagine dropping Dalamud on some dork, and you just see a giant immune icon pop up
[4:21:42] <+SpiritRoads> maybe Genova needs a hug?
[4:21:42] <+justianxix> Soooo, what was the stupidest thing Plague has seen or commented yet?
[4:21:46] <+OnTheDonner> @waifussansfrontieres Never happened for me.
[4:21:48] <jo_vo> No, Peach, no blood.
[4:21:51] <Hydrapissed> barret is being time healed
[4:21:52] <kuzokai> magix maybe?
[4:21:53] <Hydrapissed> or what ever
[4:21:55] <kuzokai> idk
[4:21:56] <@PeachSaliva> @justianxix well he breathed lol
[4:21:58] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @peachsaliva shhhhh he sleeping
[4:22:01] <+CrimsonDio11> @PeachSaliva no the plot ghosts are healing him
[4:22:02] <tokenreefer> @peachsaliva its an illusion
[4:22:03] <jo_vo> He is just waiting for a phoenix down
[4:22:09] <%caramello_man> no the ghosts healed him, he'd fiiiiiine
[4:22:09] <TheWe4pon> Time ghosts are healing him
[4:22:10] <@PeachSaliva> @crimsondio11 oh Jesus
[4:22:18] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Just wait for cutscene
[4:22:22] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the infinte sephiroth with a million masamunes was pretty dumb
[4:22:23] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PeachSaliva no the plot ghosts is taking care of him
[4:22:29] <MartiusGW> i hear boss fights are highlight
[4:22:33] <sosandstorm> This is how ALL RPG bossfights are, it's just in real time now
[4:22:42] <sosandstorm> and man does it feel worse
[4:22:45] <%Samex_Comex> Reminds me of a fight from Dragon dogma
[4:22:55] <Trinity5> i think it's only if the enemy itself is moving?
[4:22:56] <EcoFreak07> has anyone noticed the plot ghosts are literally "time wraiths" from CW Flash? LOL
[4:22:56] <Ophiuchas> they're feeding Barret potions on at a time that's why it's taking so long
[4:22:58] <Trinity5> i could be wrong
[4:23:06] <tokenreefer> this is how i imagine all my bossfights
[4:23:19] <jo_vo> The time ghosts have to build ATB and give him pots
[4:23:22] <Hydrapissed> SourPls
[4:23:25] <WaifusSansFrontieres> ah yes the fun "no stagger is over now" boss mechanics
[4:23:28] <tokenreefer> my fights with my boss
[4:23:28] <smugfox95> eew slime
[4:23:34] <jo_vo> GEOSTIGMA

[4:25:27] <%JailShmixRemix> Guess im not sleeping tonight
[4:25:33] <Hydrapissed> nope
[4:25:34] <+OnTheDonner> You know why Plague.... you know.
[4:25:38] <penitentpentwitch> Aerith is really good for this fight, just because you don't have to wander into melee
[4:25:39] <+croxeye> damn i'm just now looking at your HP and MP and stuff and how much grinding did you do?
[4:25:39] <spiritofmojave> it's super funny when she LBS and dies immediately after LUL
[4:25:51] <Medo3G> Is it even possible to stagger?
[4:26:00] <Trinity5> it si
[4:26:01] <Hydrapissed> he got one stagger
[4:26:01] <penitentpentwitch> He "Grinded a bit offscreen" until level 50
[4:26:03] <TheWe4pon> @croxeye max
[4:26:04] <availablethor> He's lvl 50
[4:26:31] <@PeachSaliva> You can never have enough tentacles.
[4:26:34] <+OnTheDonner> watch out for the stuff falling from the ceiling that does 1 dmg each
[4:26:38] <sad_toast_> wow I just had the must vivid dream with cars and a house and my X
[4:26:40] <WaifusSansFrontieres> Red 13 howling at the moon, like the cat he is
[4:26:41] <+PleasantLee> isnt 3 tentacles enough?
[4:26:50] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> There is never enough
[4:26:56] <MilkingEdge> more tentacles
[4:26:59] <Trinity5> LOL
[4:26:59] <Handsome0ne> I am surprised Pat and Paige never got a dog at the end and called it Red.
[4:27:03] <Trinity5> nice air cloud
[4:27:04] <Djinnazz> that looked cool
[4:27:17] <sosandstorm> @Handsome0ne Elmo would get eaten, to juicy of a cat
[4:27:18] <+croxeye> i see, he'll be a bit depressed to see the message after the credits about the XP and AP boosts once you beat the game
[4:27:19] <Ophiuchas> Marco!
[4:27:19] <Hydrapissed> the NEIGHBOR
[4:27:22] <BillieNoMates> It was all Marco all along!
[4:27:22] <@PeachSaliva> @handsome0ne the end?
[4:27:22] <Hydrapissed> membembebmemrermme
[4:27:24] <spiritofmojave> Look it was that one neighbor man!
[4:27:25] <Trinity5> it was marco THE WHOLE TIME
[4:27:25] <Eger007> marco
[4:27:26] <xeros720> just a clone
[4:27:28] <@PeachSaliva> Oh wow
[4:27:28] <DaiRyuseii> SephiROSS
[4:27:30] <doggieo> How did he get there
[4:27:32] <Eger007> marco polo
[4:27:36] <kuzokai> anotha one
[4:27:46] <TheLucidChiba> Blowing the Sephiroth was in the first game seems so wrong
[4:27:48] <Hydrapissed> helicopter CHAN
[4:27:48] <+PleasantLee> did sephiroth wrap Jenova up in a sexy ripped blanket?
[4:27:50] <TheLucidChiba> wad*
[4:27:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> remember when sephiroth was your neighbor one time
[4:27:55] <Trinity5> it's the OG avalanche
[4:27:58] <GilliamYaeger> Why is Sephiroth carrying JENOVA
[4:28:00] <+azure22900> I mean the reunion dudes needed to be used other than black blobs that moan and groan.
[4:28:04] <+justianxix> LOook LUL
[4:28:05] <sosandstorm> GOD DAMN IT
[4:28:05] <smugfox95> Bye seph

[4:28:14] <+KawaiiJetty> LUL
[4:28:14] <Eger007> my planet needs me
[4:28:15] <BillieNoMates> If Barret had died
[4:28:16] <shevan123> WHY
[4:28:20] <majeser> he does do that in the original
[4:28:21] <GilliamYaeger> Wasn't "Sephiroth" meant to be a shapeshifted JENOVA while the real Sephiroth is in the Crater?
[4:28:21] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> goodbye jojo
[4:28:21] <BillieNoMates> I think i could have forgiven it
[4:28:23] <kiwicoffin> The time ghosts love Barret too

[4:28:35] <kingra> F A T E
[4:28:37] <jo_vo> Its' like it never happened OOOOOOooooOOOoooOooo
[4:28:38] <Ekaelis> I guess they stabbed Barret for the purpose of You not having full party in a fight
[4:28:42] <kingra> D E S T I N Y
[4:28:43] <+OnTheDonner> @gilliamyaeger Yeah, you never meet Seph until the very end of the game
[4:28:43] <TheLucidChiba> Fucking Nomura -_-
[4:28:44] <sosandstorm> Red just, can't make eye contact with Aerith right now
[4:28:45] <Medo3G> fuck off game

[4:29:01] <jiin6> tonight...you
[4:29:03] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PlagueOfGripes but arent you impressed by the bold move to fake out barrets death and the interesting meta narratve of preserving canon through a manifest destiny plot device? so stunning and brave
[4:29:06] <theloganbrand> What if the time ghosts cause Aerith's fate.
[4:29:08] <@PeachSaliva> @handsome0ne Oh we def still want one and were planning for one, but with all the hullabaloo we gotta wait :(
[4:29:12] <jo_vo> Wait, is that the script?!
[4:29:14] <doggieo> How did the ghosts fail to kill Wedge
[4:29:19] <+justianxix> I don't think the writers know how bad this added Plot armor is bad for the story, I swear
[4:29:20] <sad_toast_> the question is How any
[4:29:26] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Remember, ghosts = FFVII purists ;)
[4:29:27] <waifoong98> @jo_vo those ghost, basically yeah
[4:29:32] <Eger007> they don't have balls to kill aerith

[4:31:12] <arkv01> "come over here and fuck me yourself, coward"
[4:31:14] <smugfox95> He's sephiroth, the bad guy
[4:31:14] <jo_vo> WHY?!

[4:31:23] <tokenreefer> shadow weapon is your blacksona
[4:31:23] <Hydrapissed> I guess
[4:31:25] <kingra> ORGANIZATION 13
[4:31:29] <spiritofmojave> OOPS all reunion clones
[4:31:32] <Verdenfert> the time ghosts giveth, and the time ghosts taketh away
[4:31:38] <Ophiuchas> sephiroth is exerting his will over the clones I guess
[4:31:39] <sad_toast_> "stop it" 🥺😖 lol cute
[4:31:39] <+croxeye> I think in an interview Nomura mentioned that they didn't bother explaining him in this game "because everyone knows who he is"
[4:31:40] <+azure22900> Or Jenova uses these pawns
[4:31:45] <WaifusSansFrontieres> the story cant decide if it wants to be for people who know or for people who dont know
[4:31:47] <jiin6> all the S units
[4:31:49] <xeros720> well, it might just be different now
[4:31:55] <Trinity5> whos manz
[4:31:58] <Hydrapissed> Snaps finger
[4:32:00] <+EpicureanIguana> wank material has been established
[4:32:01] <arkv01> he was the one who got away
[4:32:02] <Eger007> he's better without glasses
[4:32:09] <@PeachSaliva> No wonder people who never played the original are so confused
[4:32:11] <jo_vo> WOW
[4:32:11] <+PleasantLee> I think they're writing it so Jenova, Sephy clones and sephiroth are interchangable
[4:32:12] <Hydrapissed> mike?
[4:32:13] <SnickSnack666> I preferd my thory that jenova commin in contact with cloud is what woke up jenova
[4:32:14] <%Samex_Comex> Mike
[4:32:15] <+azure22900> Mike
[4:32:15] <availablethor> I think we can assume at this point that every "Sephiroth" has been 1: Cloud's crazy imagination 2. A reunion clone
[4:32:16] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> ff7r has the batman problem. we all know how batman became batman. the problem is that ff7r just assumed sephiroth is so popular that how could you not know his whole story
[4:32:16] <GilliamYaeger> HERE COMES GUN VERGIL
[4:32:18] <sosandstorm> and they drop a THIRD plate muhahaha

[4:33:11] <arkv01> mike killed kadaj in advent children
[4:33:11] <+OnTheDonner> He's also blond now for some reason
[4:33:12] <Ophiuchas> not enough belts 🥴
[4:33:12] <sosandstorm> That... some final fantasy shit
[4:33:13] <TheWe4pon> what the fuck are with his clothes.
[4:33:14] <BillieNoMates> He played DMC 5 and decided he needed belts
[4:33:14] <jo_vo> Yep, tentacle dog
[4:33:15] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> he did have belts
[4:33:18] <SnickSnack666> This Rufus is really bad ass tho
[4:33:19] <TheWe4pon> fuck this game
[4:33:20] <sad_toast_> that's a Nomura amount of belts
[4:33:20] <+EpicureanIguana> Nomura says 'more belts!'
[4:33:20] <waifoong98> @PeachSaliva he is now lol
[4:33:21] <shevan123> what happened nomura, why are you like this
[4:33:21] <spiritofmojave> He also has a shotgun atleast
[4:33:21] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PlagueOfGripes time ghosts show up and take his belts cause its different
[4:33:22] <MilkingEdge> Nomura BELTS
[4:33:24] <availablethor> This is FINAL FANTASY, things must have belts
[4:33:25] <jo_vo> He had three pieces of clothing
[4:33:25] <jiin6> Nomura loves belts
[4:33:29] <spiritofmojave> B E L T S
[4:33:30] <kingra> Where's his suit? Why's he so STUPID looking?
[4:33:30] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the belts was the first thing i noticed back when i played
[4:33:35] <gunsrlove> God that dress looks FUCKING HORRIBLE
[4:33:36] <jiin6> Crisis core?
[4:33:38] <Tikigod784> Meanwhile Sephiroth is Vergil
[4:33:39] <sad_toast_> but does he have Zippers???
[4:33:40] <jo_vo> His dress, his shirt and his jacket
[4:33:43] <theloganbrand> Barret and Cloud Relationship good
[4:33:43] <Trinity5> monkaS
[4:33:45] <TheLucidChiba> Him fighting alone made way more sense in the original :/.
[4:33:46] <+PleasantLee> @PeachSaliva he's been blonde since advent children. no redheads for you. but redxiii is red, that makes up for it right?
[4:33:49] <Hydrapissed> I mean
[4:33:52] <arkv01> it MUST be unbuttoned as the cops carry the time ghost away
[4:33:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> Rufus is wearing unbuttoned chaps on top of his pants
[4:33:58] <+UnwoundCaesar70> WHAT?!
[4:34:01] <Hydrapissed> the pedometer rings true
[4:34:01] <GeltonZ> That would be me. I'm that time ghost.
[4:34:04] <spiritofmojave> WHAT LUL
[4:34:05] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> ff7r is gingerwashing
[4:34:07] <Tikigod784> COMPLETE GLOBAL TIME GHOST SATURATION
[4:34:08] <WaifusSansFrontieres> would any of you go as far as call the time ghosts insulting to fans of the original story?
[4:34:08] <BillieNoMates> Just wait till they find out Remake Yuffie is a transvestite
[4:34:08] <xrolenks> time for any annoying ass boss
[4:34:12] <%caramello_man> WutFace
[4:34:16] <+PleasantLee> he would be SO warm
[4:34:17] <sad_toast_> "slootification""
[4:34:20] <Trinity5> guess what
[4:34:21] <Hydrapissed> time for more anime battles
[4:34:22] <arkv01> mmmm thats some hot rufus ass
[4:34:25] <Trinity5> it's gonna be another anime battle
[4:34:26] <Tikigod784> @WaifusSansFrontieres That's literally what they are
[4:34:27] <MilkingEdge> Soldier First Class
[4:34:27] <+PleasantLee> oh Eli....YOU WANNA SEE SOME ANIME!?
[4:34:28] <+OnTheDonner> Hold onto your butt Plague

[4:34:42] <TheLucidChiba> Yeah Rufus seems bland now
[4:34:42] <arkv01> just us, you and my dog
[4:34:44] <+KawaiiJetty> In the original he just had a shotgun
[4:34:44] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Who names their kid "Rufus" anyway?
[4:34:54] <jo_vo> lol Darkstar
[4:34:56] <Ophiuchas> "takes too much to do it like my old man"
[4:34:56] <+justianxix> At least he has a cool vergil fight
[4:34:59] <Medo3G> snuff him
[4:34:59] <DaiRyuseii> Darkstar? ITS NAME IS DARK NATION
[4:35:02] <+PleasantLee> god this fight is annoying
[4:35:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> someone who has a red-head child, would name their kid Rufus
[4:35:05] <shevan123> nice combo rufus
[4:35:05] <GeltonZ> Can we just appreciate that his dog is named DARKSTAR? Because I love that.
[4:35:06] <mrgaster8> @gunsrlove oooooooooo boy
[4:35:06] <smugfox95> Hes got dog combos? why cant this guy be the player character
[4:35:07] <+OnTheDonner> @kawaiijetty Naw he had the dog too

[4:35:15] <BillieNoMates> This guy has some balls tho. He knows you are SOLDIER and still wants to throw down with his companies super soldier
[4:35:17] <+theComradGeneral> this game assumes you've seen the movies
[4:35:17] <arkv01> ok I gotta give rufus style points
[4:35:19] <sosandstorm> oh man i hate rpg fights
[4:35:21] <+PleasantLee> anyone want to see some input reading?
[4:35:25] <availablethor> Giga Drill Dogger

[4:35:34] <+KawaiiJetty> @onthedonner oh sorry i mean a plain shotgun. nothing stylish
[4:35:34] <%JailShmixRemix> this game assumes you know all about the ff7

[4:35:57] <penitentpentwitch> Until Dog goes down, it'll keep healing Rufus
[4:36:02] <%Samex_Comex> Dog combos
[4:36:02] <sad_toast_> that happened to me once 😔
[4:36:04] <+croxeye> @JailShmixRemix yep it's unfortanate for ppl who haven't because you'll miss a lot of context in this game
[4:36:08] <+EpicureanIguana> the real question is who names his dog 'Darkstar' LUL
[4:36:08] <arkv01> this doggo is TOUGH
[4:36:09] <jo_vo> To corkscrew or knot to sorkscrew, that is the question
[4:36:18] <arkv01> oh my god this sexual tension

[4:36:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> BUT ITS SO DUMB BUT ITS SO COOL
[4:36:50] <+OnTheDonner> This vice president of an electric company has coins that turn into lasers
[4:36:52] <@Nightbot> @Solid_Stro -> Nightbot one, bad guys zero. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:36:57] <@PeachSaliva> He’s so rich, he uses money to literally kill you.
[4:36:58] <shevan123> i love you guilty gear
[4:36:59] <+UnwoundCaesar70> You gotta be a badass before you become President
[4:37:03] <WaifusSansFrontieres> no seriously I cna already hear this figh being talked about in nothing else but the context that it is cool looking
[4:37:10] <+thewordofhelix> MUH LAZER!!
[4:37:12] <arkv01> I can't even argue with that, what else would you buy if you had money?
[4:37:12] <jo_vo> I have cash to burn and coins to shoot, don't test me
[4:37:16] <MilkingEdge> Rufus makin it rain GIL
[4:37:17] <TheWe4pon> power_of_money.gif
[4:37:18] <WaifusSansFrontieres> man no one I talk to or watch thinks about this story even for a second
[4:37:18] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Of Shinra Electric Company
[4:37:22] <spiritofmojave> it's a good use of mon!
[4:37:23] <+PleasantLee> is that coin what Gil looks like?
[4:37:24] <enpassantpassader> is plagueofgripes a potion hoarder?
[4:37:24] <Trinity5> nice
[4:37:28] <sosandstorm> @WaifusSansFrontieres yeah, but it IS cool looking though
[4:37:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> "I will jkill you with a quarter!"
[4:37:36] <+justianxix> I agree, a better president for Shrina should know how to fire Railguns
[4:37:36] <Trinity5> "potion hoarder" this game just showers you with potions
[4:37:38] <jiin6> he is a Shinra
[4:37:39] <DoctorToast_> everything staggers in this fight
[4:37:51] <%Samex_Comex> Gas coins too
[4:37:52] <BillieNoMates> Rufus harder than Jenova LUL
[4:37:53] <availablethor> Vice-President Capitalism literally shoots you with his money.
[4:37:54] <jo_vo> He wants to be Conner from Detroit: Become Human
[4:37:55] <+thewordofhelix> fkn david blaine over here
[4:38:01] <arkv01> I gotta say this fight is a lot cooler than OG
[4:38:01] <BillieNoMates> "Why do we need SOLDIER again?"
[4:38:10] <majeser> he's just using spare change
[4:38:20] <GilliamYaeger> Stop using Punisher mode
[4:38:25] <Trinity5> remember punisher parry can't block ranged attacks
[4:38:28] <WaifusSansFrontieres> well you are suing the "no bullets blocking stance" against bullets
[4:38:30] <+theComradGeneral> you could try dodging them
[4:38:30] <WaifusSansFrontieres> thats on you
[4:38:32] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[4:38:34] <availablethor> It also reminds me of Lady Maria of the Astral Clocktower for some reason.
[4:38:37] <BillieNoMates> Cloud vs V
[4:38:38] <jo_vo> WHAT THE FRAGGING WHAT?!
[4:38:38] <xeros720> yeah, it wants you to dodge here
[4:38:39] <+PleasantLee> best. boss.
[4:38:44] <+PleasantLee> ...
[4:38:44] <mrgaster8> f
[4:38:44] <GilliamYaeger> Punisher parry can't block guns
[4:38:49] <Hydrapissed> I bet u can dodge it either
[4:38:49] <+thewordofhelix> dude is using sick GUN magic
[4:38:50] <+PleasantLee> he gets worse
[4:38:50] <WaifusSansFrontieres> counter stance cant block bullets
[4:38:53] <Hydrapissed> cant*
[4:38:53] <Ophiuchas> ya gotta be aggressive and fast and use counters
[4:38:54] <GilliamYaeger> Counterstance can't counter explosions
[4:38:54] <+croxeye> counter-stance and parries only activate on melees
[4:38:56] <xrolenks> his lazers can't be blocked
[4:38:57] <@PeachSaliva> Fuck
[4:38:57] <penitentpentwitch> Switch cure materia onto Cloud?
[4:38:58] <+theComradGeneral> wow
[4:39:00] <sosandstorm> Drop your shield plague
[4:39:01] <jiin6> punisher can't block
[4:39:03] <spiritofmojave> lasers definitely can't be blocked
[4:39:06] <sad_toast_> announcer ""looks like he doesn't have many healing potions Chip.. that's going to really hurt him in the 3rd quarter let's see if he can make it work!""
[4:39:08] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Don't worry about Rufus. Just doggo
[4:39:09] <+justianxix> Counter only works with physical tho, he use a gun
[4:39:10] <+theComradGeneral> why even have a dodge button
[4:39:13] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> ARE YOU READY FOR THE GUN MAGE DRESS SPHERE FIGHT
[4:39:18] <+PleasantLee> input reads you like a book
[4:39:18] <kuzokai> I'm having yakuza 1 final boss flashbacks
[4:39:24] <+EpicureanIguana> Rufus Shinra Darkstar of the edge lives by the rule of cool
[4:39:36] <+thewordofhelix> have you tried punching him in the dick?
[4:39:40] <Trinity5> didn't put a healing materia on
[4:39:46] <Trinity5> did he?
[4:39:47] <penitentpentwitch> At least it drops you before the boss fight so you can switch materia
[4:39:58] <Hydrapissed> 420 damage
[4:40:08] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> lol
[4:40:17] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> bad rufus
[4:40:19] <+PleasantLee> hey @PeachSaliva Aeris or Tifa?... oh and Yuffie I guess
[4:40:34] <spiritofmojave> why can't you be more like your dog, gee
[4:40:39] <penitentpentwitch> How... logical of him
[4:40:44] <Medo3G> rude
[4:40:49] <KattenBertil> anime?
[4:40:49] <+justianxix> The rule of cool
[4:40:49] <+PleasantLee> maybe the coin is filled with MAKO?
[4:40:49] <BillieNoMates> Assess him and find out if it tells you
[4:40:50] <Trinity5> yeah but it's cool so fuck it
[4:40:52] <GilliamYaeger> They're probably one-use attack items
[4:40:53] <Hydrapissed> chocobo sam coins
[4:40:53] <availablethor> It's a railgun.
[4:40:54] <arkv01> nomura guns SHHH
[4:40:55] <Trinity5> in this case i give it a pass
[4:40:58] <kuzokai> nomura logic
[4:40:58] <+azure22900> Railgun thing
[4:41:00] <arkv01> its fuckin cool
[4:41:01] <jo_vo> BUllshit
[4:41:02] <MilkingEdge> STyle points
[4:41:07] <+thewordofhelix> twist his dick off!
[4:41:08] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Does this fight have a square equip prompt at the start of the cutscene? I can't remember
[4:41:08] <mrgaster8> trigun
[4:41:13] <TheWe4pon> does his gun split into 2 guns then back to one?
[4:41:13] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> did you rike it
[4:41:18] <BillieNoMates> You didnt land the counter
[4:41:21] <arkv01> I can imagine woolie creaming to this whole fight
[4:41:24] <kuzokai> if nomura thinks it's cool, he will ignore all else
[4:41:26] <availablethor> A railgun is a gun that accelerates a piece of hot metal at very high speeds.
[4:41:40] <medril07> try me bitch
[4:41:41] <availablethor> He' doing a LITERAL rail gun.
[4:41:46] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> oh that makes a little more sense
[4:41:50] <Tikigod784> @TheWe4pon Yeah, it's a RWBY shotgun now
[4:42:00] <+OnTheDonner> I only beat this boss cause my limit took off like 90% of his health
[4:42:02] <WaifusSansFrontieres> @PlagueOfGripes for reasons no one can explain counterstance does not break doggo chain, only punisher counter does, i guess it's because counterstance is an optional ability
[4:42:10] <+KawaiiJetty> if it makes you happy there is a no damage on rufus video i guess
[4:42:19] <jo_vo> A railgun uses magnets
[4:42:21] <+thewordofhelix> lol
[4:42:23] <xrolenks> heal up since you dont have any healing materia
[4:42:31] <+PleasantLee> atleast he loves his pupper in this one and doesnt let it die
[4:42:37] <Trinity5> i can't believe plague has 12 elixirs lol
[4:42:39] <penitentpentwitch> Now phase 3!
[4:42:40] <BillieNoMates> No doggo, it's time to get KERAZY
[4:42:44] <+PleasantLee> ANIMEEEE
[4:42:45] <availablethor> Yeah. He doesn't use magnets, he uses ANIME.
[4:42:46] <Hydrapissed> Gun boost
[4:42:53] <FrostedZaibatsu> Rufus dressed like a PSO2 character
[4:42:54] <TheWe4pon> WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT
[4:43:00] <spiritofmojave> look at this gunbreaker shit
[4:43:00] <GilliamYaeger> Hit him with Braver while he's reloading
[4:43:02] <TheWe4pon> BULLSHIT
[4:43:04] <TheLucidChiba> The FUck
[4:43:07] <sosandstorm> no, it's cool
[4:43:08] <Trinity5> tbf it's so stupid it's kinda dope
[4:43:11] <jo_vo> Oh so he is now too light for the gun to recoil appropriately
[4:43:12] <+thewordofhelix> slide to win bby
[4:43:12] <MilkingEdge> Gun boosters
[4:43:13] <shevan123> i love this stupid shit
[4:43:14] <Hydrapissed> hellll yeh
[4:43:18] <kuzokai> it's not just stupid, its nomura
[4:43:18] <Tikigod784> literally RWBY
[4:43:18] <theloganbrand> Tf2 Soldier looking ass
[4:43:19] <Hydrapissed> go dumber awww yeh
[4:43:20] <+justianxix> Nah Its Cool
[4:43:20] <mrgaster8> yeyeyey
[4:43:21] <sosandstorm> you're right, but that's what makes it so cool
[4:43:22] <+theComradGeneral> god fuck you namura
[4:43:25] <TheLucidChiba> He's a frickin bureaucrat, the fuck is he so strong for?
[4:43:26] <jo_vo> It's just an armored core boost overdrive now
[4:43:27] <%JailShmixRemix> TBH the stupid shit is cool
[4:43:27] <+KawaiiJetty> At least he is not pulling an actual massive railgun out of his butt
[4:43:35] <+crowmium> yeah he's too Weskar it's not even funny
[4:43:35] <jiin6> if Rwby took inspiration, NOMURA TAKE IT
[4:43:38] <availablethor> I like it. Rufus is a lame and stupid character in the original too.
[4:43:39] <%Samex_Comex> What a lazy fuck, I bet that's how he gets around his house too
[4:43:41] <Zundelle> that is incredibly stupid but I'll allow it I'm a fan
[4:43:41] <JoeBecomesJoe> Yeah you can count his shots
[4:43:42] <+PleasantLee> yeah when he reloads
[4:43:44] <+OnTheDonner> Cloud can go faster when he slices the air in half and removes friction
[4:43:45] <+EpicureanIguana> to be honest this is the kind of stupid shit i can get behind, unlike the narrative
[4:43:49] <FrostedZaibatsu> R for reload
[4:43:50] <sad_toast_> I like it!!!! using the gun for momentum is very Anime and very cool 👌
[4:43:50] <+PleasantLee> too many belts
[4:43:51] <%Demirose41> I mean Barret is just some guy and he can shoot fricken Lazer beams
[4:43:54] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> You can put him to sleep too
[4:43:59] <Firaga64> Braver when he's reloading
[4:44:03] <sosandstorm> sooooo cool
[4:44:05] <sad_toast_> yeah it's LAME!! and I LOVE it!!!!
[4:44:08] <spiritofmojave> but I just think it's neat :)
[4:44:19] <+PleasantLee> its projectiles, you cant counter
[4:44:20] <sosandstorm> Man what a badass
[4:44:28] <peterthepanda115> Don't know But I am from the school of "it's cool, because its stupid" of Nomura City
[4:44:29] <TheLucidChiba> This seems like a poorly made fight :/
[4:44:36] <Medo3G> spells?
[4:44:36] <+justianxix> wait, did plague scan him yet?
[4:44:39] <Trinity5> no
[4:44:39] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> eh its cool dumb. there are a lot of dumb problems but having a cool duel is worth it i guess
[4:44:41] <GiygasDrillBreak> he's vulnerable after he sprays you
[4:44:42] <JoeBecomesJoe> Count his shots and predict the reload
[4:44:44] <SeBigBoss> attack during reload?
[4:44:47] <+OnTheDonner> This ceo is like the strongest dude in the world
[4:44:48] <+PleasantLee> he input reads like a chode, only attack when he is reloading
[4:44:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> he's open when he reloads
[4:44:50] <examplez0> Use your atb moves
[4:44:58] <availablethor> That health bar seems a bit excessive though.
[4:45:15] <shevan123> cuz iz kewl
[4:45:15] <penitentpentwitch> Use an ATB attack when he's reloading. It's hard to get in on him though.
[4:45:19] <jiin6> Rufus' an edgelord
[4:45:21] <reiface08> i thought his name was dark nation
[4:45:21] <sad_toast_> @pleasantlee your so right
[4:45:25] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Magic until stun, then sword. Also attack on reload.
[4:45:27] <BillieNoMates> I think you use Focused Thrust to abuse his reload
[4:45:29] <+EpicureanIguana> Darkstar reeks of furry
[4:45:47] <+OnTheDonner> Attack during the 1 1/2 seconds he's open on the other side of the arena
[4:45:48] <xeros720> supposedly you can instantly stagger him with a certain move
[4:45:51] <penitentpentwitch> Combat reload allows him to counter you
[4:46:09] <+PleasantLee> if you use assess on him its real coy and says "MAYBE IF YOU ATTACK HIM AT A CERTAIN TIME WITH A CERTAIN MOVE! what could it beeeeeee?"
[4:46:10] <sosandstorm> yeah but it's an awesome spectacle
[4:46:13] <JoeBecomesJoe> I liked this fight. Had a bit more going on than mash it out to win
[4:46:21] <Tikigod784> you just gotta git gud, get anime, get down
[4:46:23] <jiin6> this is on the test fight
[4:46:25] <+justianxix> What fights do you like? or Bosses should I say?
[4:46:29] <Trinity5> yeah i thought this fight was actually neat
[4:46:37] <+KawaiiJetty> Yeah i don't mind this fight
[4:46:43] <jiin6> i really liked this fight
[4:46:46] <+PleasantLee> big lame fight
[4:46:48] <sosandstorm> pretty great
[4:46:48] <Tikigod784> squeenix does good on the human-sized fights
[4:46:53] <+PleasantLee> practically a puzzle fight
[4:47:01] <examplez0> Nomura gonna Nomura
[4:47:02] <+Kaask> apparently the only move that staggers him is limit break
[4:47:10] <arkv01> doggos expendable
[4:47:10] <+Kaask> counterstance did massive damage for me though
[4:47:15] <+azure22900> Dog accidently back jumped off the side
[4:47:15] <examplez0> no pun intented?
[4:47:17] <jiin6> he marathroned RWBY
[4:47:19] <sosandstorm> naw he's making money moves
[4:47:23] <+thewordofhelix> bye doggie
[4:47:24] <sad_toast_> "SHOT GUN FARTS" 🤣🤣🤣
[4:47:24] <%Samex_Comex> He's farting away!
[4:47:28] <+EpicureanIguana> he wears 20 belts what did you expect
[4:47:35] <Hydrapissed> oh yah he will
[4:47:35] <Trinity5> woolie too
[4:47:36] <shevan123> oh yeah he was a huge coward in the original
[4:47:41] <Hydrapissed> the copter escape to
[4:47:49] <Medo3G> that heavy sword aint helping
[4:47:54] <JoeBecomesJoe> She has a point
[4:47:56] <Trinity5> "yeah that's all fine and dandy tifa but help me the fuck up"
[4:47:57] <TheWe4pon> "man up bitch"
[4:47:57] <KaiserMario> I can hear the "HE'S SO COOL" already
[4:47:58] <+theComradGeneral> tifa is still love tifa is stil life
[4:48:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> this would be so much easier if he didnt have a 200lb sword
[4:48:00] <Hydrapissed> 3 days
[4:48:01] <penitentpentwitch> Pat'll be very afraid when Barret gets stabbed
[4:48:02] <GilliamYaeger> About an hourish
[4:48:02] <sad_toast_> oh Pat's gonna flip he loves Stoopid crap like that
[4:48:02] <BillieNoMates> not much
[4:48:04] <Trinity5> 2 hours?

[4:48:07] <+OnTheDonner> You have like.. 3 hours left
[4:48:07] <penitentpentwitch> 3 more boss fights
[4:48:09] <+justianxix> At least 1:30 - 2 hours

[4:48:10] <+terry_quest> 2-3h

[4:48:28] <TheLucidChiba> Just don't let Aerith heal it
[4:48:38] <Huntercd> Why does he look wet?
[4:48:38] <examplez0> When you were climbing up to the Shinra building in like chapter 13
[4:48:43] <Hydrapissed> it was gold
[4:48:45] <arkv01> oh we didn't have the scene where we meet the turks in the helicopter

[4:49:22] <examplez0> This is so dumb

[4:49:28] <Trinity5> the lad
[4:49:28] <Ophiuchas> for cheeseburgers too!
[4:49:32] <examplez0> Why couldn't they just let him die before?
[4:49:33] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I need me that home made pizza in the sequel
[4:49:34] <kingra> No :)
[4:49:34] <penitentpentwitch> Hungry lad defeated!
[4:49:34] <%Samex_Comex> Come on Wedge you can do it!
[4:49:34] <GilliamYaeger> They threw him down the elevator shaft
[4:49:35] <availablethor> Jessie is dead. The ghosts decided that her thirst was too much.
[4:49:35] <Hydrapissed> and they threw him off the building
[4:49:37] <Hydrapissed> and we didnt see it
[4:49:37] <shevan123> you didnt wedge sorry

[4:51:08] <Trinity5> yes
[4:51:08] <JoeBecomesJoe> He can

[4:54:37] <%theComradGeneral> everythings gotta have a stupid auto target teleport floor ability trash
[4:54:38] <%caramello_man> Melee attacks, both characters are ranged
[4:54:38] <Trinity5> how the fuck are you supposed to hit them with melee lol
[4:54:39] <TheWe4pon> Arsenal Gear!?
[4:54:42] <Trinity5> i just noticed this
[4:54:45] <Trinity5> wait huh?
[4:54:49] <kiwicoffin> Red XIII is perfect for this oh wait
[4:54:54] <shevan123> BUT THATS THE GIMMICK OF THIS BOSS WH6
[4:54:55] <+OnTheDonner> Quick, switch to your melee charac... oh
[4:54:57] <Djinnazz> Velocity
[4:54:57] <Trinity5> how the fuck did i beat this boss the first time
[4:55:00] <+justianxix> @OnTheDonner Same. Thought he would have more t say and think on then just I CLAP WHEN I SEE THE SEPHIROTH. I CLAPPED.
[4:55:20] <+crowmium> "The Arsenal" sounds fucking dumb
[4:55:27] <waifoong98> @justianxix "it exceeds expectation" urghhh
[4:55:30] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i just spammed thundaga in the doublecast bubble
[4:55:32] <shevan123> why the fuck wod you make a boss about ranged attacks and then make enemies invulnerable
[4:55:39] <jo_vo> Heidegger named it
[4:56:02] <shevan123> EXACTLY
[4:56:03] <BillieNoMates> NANAKI GOOOOOOO
[4:56:03] <GilliamYaeger> Red has melee attacks
[4:56:08] <Trinity5> really makes you think huh
[4:56:14] <%caramello_man> no fuck you
[4:56:15] <+PleasantLee> shoot the drones then shoot the wheels, then shoot the cannon
[4:56:16] <spiritofmojave> Nanaki do your thang!
[4:56:17] <DaiRyuseii> SHAME RED ISN'T FUCKING CONTROLLABLE
[4:56:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's not that bad with ranged and magic, you're also Lv 50
[4:56:29] <+OnTheDonner> The drones go down really fast, honestly
[4:56:32] <Medo3G> maybe no effect on stagger
[4:56:34] <+justianxix> LUL
[4:56:36] <%theComradGeneral> HAHAA
[4:57:15] <+justianxix> nice
[4:57:23] <+PleasantLee> red is a goodboy
[4:57:24] <Trinity5> god job doggo
[4:57:31] <sad_toast_> even though 13 can talk and is intelligent you can tell him what to do because he's still a Wild Animal
[4:57:41] <shevan123> wh6 are there even bosses that dont take advantage of a games system
[4:57:42] <Ophiuchas> reds a real cutie pie
[4:57:45] <+PleasantLee> I bet you'll have to play red a lot in remake part 2
[4:58:29] <Ophiuchas> aeris's shield can protect against the little attacks
[4:58:30] <+EpicureanIguana> i hear big chunky healthbars make for fun boss fights
[4:58:40] <Trinity5> big chonker
[4:58:42] <%caramello_man> Feel the CHUNK
[4:58:47] <%Samex_Comex> It's huge!
[4:58:47] <Thorlnn> Oh my lerd
[4:58:48] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Chonkobo
[4:58:54] <Handsome0ne> Big boned chocobo
[4:58:55] <sad_toast_> how Rude 😒
[4:59:00] <MilkingEdge> KFChonk
[4:59:09] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i would cuddle that chonk
[4:59:15] <Trinity5> D:
[4:59:15] <+crowmium> what are his abilities?
[4:59:42] <%Samex_Comex> It just starts unloading on the chocobo ripping it to shreds
[5:00:26] <shevan123> okay so that description was a lie, this isnt as bqd ws i thought
[5:00:33] <Trinity5> wedge is that you?
[5:00:45] <sad_toast_> time to be fat!!!
[5:01:14] <BillieNoMates> Thats what Familiar added
[5:01:22] <+thefakeh> havent you learned yet plague? first you have the "immune to fuckin everything phase", and then you get the "moves around the arena so fast you cant hit the cunt"
[5:01:40] <Trinity5> yeah this boss sucked lol
[5:02:07] <WaifusSansFrontieres> quick hide behind fat chocobo, the arsenal is gonna take at least 30 seconds to fully penetrate its flesh
[5:02:18] <+PleasantLee> hit them when the shields are down I think
[5:02:41] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Ugh I remember waiting for Red to do attacks on the wheels
[5:02:55] <BillieNoMates> "What do You have to shoot the wheels when its not shielded
[5:02:58] <JoeBecomesJoe> It cast wall of flame
[5:02:59] <+OnTheDonner> I just ignored the wheels
[5:03:11] <GilliamYaeger> Full heal revive
[5:03:16] <BillieNoMates> Full Heal revive
[5:03:17] <+PleasantLee> arise gives full heal rez
[5:03:22] <%caramello_man> Chicken arise!
[5:03:32] <TheWe4pon> sounds familiar
[5:03:37] <+justianxix> The one use ear ring?
[5:03:40] <penitentpentwitch> It looks like the wheels lose their shields when you stagger him by shooting him the weak point on his back
[5:04:06] <GilliamYaeger> Aero did 6000 damage, wow
[5:04:36] <Trinity5> i had WAY more trouble with this boss than rufus
[5:04:57] <+PleasantLee> wheels
[5:05:08] <sad_toast_> a good boss fight is Challenging and enjoyable
[5:05:47] <+PleasantLee> arcane ward + refocus = 6 thundaga casts
[5:05:51] <%bettysharkface> I love Barret being like "watch and learn" and then he shoots da gun
[5:06:02] <Trinity5> it doesn't help that ai aerith tends to fuck off from the ward
[5:06:09] <Trinity5> but yeah 6 thundaga casts is pretty tight
[5:06:29] <shevan123> maybe because it lifts her into the air a bit
[5:06:33] <DaiRyuseii> That looked like Ungarmax
[5:06:41] <Trinity5> get a full up squad on that ward and a one way train to pound down
[5:06:49] <penitentpentwitch> This fight makes good use of switching characters
[5:07:05] <Trinity5> perfectly timed
[5:07:18] <Trinity5> oh right this is the part of the fight that i hated
[5:07:20] <+justianxix> kill or die
[5:07:24] <penitentpentwitch> DPS race
[5:07:29] <Trinity5> damn if only plague had limit
[5:07:32] <+PleasantLee> ATTACKKKKK
[5:07:39] <MilkingEdge> IMMA FIREIN MAH LAZER
[5:07:41] <Trinity5> FUCK EM UP
[5:07:41] <sad_toast_> kill it before but BLOWS!!!!
[5:07:50] <Trinity5> ayyy okay nice
[5:07:56] <+PleasantLee> huh that move was called "cry havoc"
[5:07:59] <shevan123> cool fight
[5:08:04] <Medo3G> rip arsenal gear
[5:08:06] <kiwicoffin> damn it's good to be a gangster
[5:08:08] <Zulrez> pretty sure you were supposed to use barrets melee weapons on its wheels
[5:08:10] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Wheels slow the thing down and do semi decent damage. Useful for when you're not Lv 50. lol
[5:08:11] <+KawaiiJetty> That is good Red
[5:08:14] <DaiRyuseii> TIME FOR PHASE 2
[5:08:16] <%Samex_Comex> I'm dead
[5:08:26] <MilkingEdge> emo red
[5:08:33] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> no theyre not the time ghosts would shove potions in their asses
[5:08:44] <MilkingEdge> were all dead on the inside
[5:08:44] <jo_vo> Red being a cold mufuka is pretty faithful
[5:08:49] <sad_toast_> red is so eno 🙄
[5:08:50] <Trinity5> yeah there's too many invincible cutscene transitions
[5:08:56] <Trinity5> like, WAYYYY too many
[5:09:06] <shevan123> yeah the cutscenes are obnoxious
[5:09:08] <%caramello_man> it also removes stagger which is fucking stupid
[5:09:23] <+justianxix> Notice there is no truck
[5:09:23] <kiwicoffin> Suddenly
[5:09:24] <DaiRyuseii> There was a 2nd boss to the Arsenal fight in the original
[5:09:25] <Zulrez> its nice though that your summon ults dont trigger during cut scenes
[5:09:31] <%bettysharkface> Wait...did you unbutton your shirt to go pee?
[5:09:31] <sad_toast_> he comes. . he fights.. he dies no Bull
[5:09:36] <Trinity5> @Zulrez true
[5:09:38] <MilkingEdge> soldier first class
[5:09:47] <examplez0> Yeah he pisses through his nipples
[5:09:49] <%Samex_Comex> He pees from his nipples
[5:09:50] <+PleasantLee> thats where the pee comes from, sharkface
[5:09:57] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The only annoying thing about mid boss cutscenes is that they become immune if you destroy them too hard. So some attacks become pointless depending
[5:09:59] <Medo3G> time ghosts get him
[5:10:00] <GilliamYaeger> This sorta happened in the original game
[5:10:05] <kiwicoffin> The time ghosts are very picky about the things allowed
[5:10:08] <+justianxix> Exactly
[5:10:10] <BillieNoMates> haha
[5:10:10] <GilliamYaeger> Except the soldiers were OUTSIDE the building
[5:10:13] <+spacehouse> a matter of Ghost you mean
[5:10:13] <jo_vo> Oh wow
[5:10:15] <shevan123> 6ep
[5:10:17] <Eger007> so he's a dog
[5:10:20] <GilliamYaeger> Barret ran out, shot at them, then ran back in
[5:10:24] <Medo3G> gottem
[5:10:25] <Trinity5> i do like the delivery on "local florist"
[5:10:35] <+justianxix> also a cat
[5:10:36] <+PleasantLee> barret should deliver the jerk off gesture with his gunarm
[5:10:37] <DaiRyuseii> So they had the rufus scene with heidegger instead for the other characters that aren't cloud?
[5:10:43] <BillieNoMates> I thought that Red XIII was important too?
[5:10:46] <penitentpentwitch> Really brings into question how he has kids in the distant future
[5:10:55] <shevan123> YEYEYE HERE IT COMES
[5:10:58] <+PleasantLee> ruiiiiined
[5:10:58] <xrolenks> cloud here to save the day like usual
[5:10:59] <+thefakeh> DANTE?
[5:11:09] <+PleasantLee> needs the music, needs the bouncing wheel on the stairs
[5:11:10] <kiwicoffin> Unless the time ghosts already know what's going to happen next, so they don't interfere
[5:11:12] <DaiRyuseii> Yeah this just isn't doing it for me
[5:11:12] <sad_toast_> cloud 😎
[5:11:13] <examplez0> QUICK MEN STAND THERE AND DON'T SHOOT THEM
[5:11:35] <availablethor> cloud is doing a roche
[5:11:36] <examplez0> Nomura is the eternal 13 year old
[5:11:37] <Ageingyoungrebel> LUL
[5:11:38] <Trinity5> the door still opens the other way too
[5:11:40] <Trinity5> good job
[5:11:40] <%Samex_Comex> Yeah go Kup!
[5:11:41] <+PleasantLee> I imagine you have this truck on your farm somewhere
[5:11:46] <JoeBecomesJoe> Why did she pick that one?
[5:11:48] <jo_vo> It was a righthand drive, wasn't it?
[5:11:51] <jo_vo> Huh
[5:11:51] <vonmaultke> I prefer the old way that actually made sense
[5:11:53] <jo_vo> Weird
[5:11:58] <DaiRyuseii> AND THEY HAD TO HAVE THE MONEY SHOT
[5:12:00] <+PleasantLee> tifa could have got literally any other vehicle, it would have been better
[5:12:02] <Ageingyoungrebel> PogChamp
[5:12:02] <+KawaiiJetty> so cool though
[5:12:03] <Trinity5> CLOUD WAS NEVER THIS COOL
[5:12:06] <DaiRyuseii> Okay this is fucking stupid
[5:12:09] <+crazyboynph> i had to log in just to say, can u stop bitching, holy fk, this stream, biggest whining bitch on twitch
[5:12:10] <Ophiuchas> cringe
[5:12:11] <TheLucidChiba> Not sure if they added anythingin the Remake, but I loved how Cloud was so good with that bike despite never riding one in his life before
[5:12:12] <shevan123> yeah?
[5:12:12] <sosandstorm> fuck that hurts my shoulder
[5:12:13] <TheWe4pon> STOP
[5:12:17] <NineBall3D> I JUST REALIZED THT GUYS VOIC IS MARCUS FENIX
[5:12:17] <gunsrlove> ANIMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[5:12:19] <jo_vo> These motorcycle scenes are stupid
[5:12:19] <TheWe4pon> FUCKING STOP
[5:12:20] <Medo3G> you should probably switch that sword when you get the chance
[5:12:20] <jo_vo> Jesus
[5:12:20] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA STYLE
[5:12:31] <%bettysharkface> Ok first on all
[5:12:36] <shevan123> just dont tm
[5:12:37] <%bettysharkface> The weight of that bike?
[5:12:38] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @crazyboynph you must be new here. lol
[5:12:39] <examplez0> And don't use shakycam either
[5:12:42] <+crowmium> that's a really common kind of truck in Japan
[5:12:46] <+crazyboynph> yes and now im leaving :D
[5:12:56] <DaiRyuseii> Cloud, that wasn't essential
[5:12:59] <Handsome0ne> Slowmo works well with Deadpool!
[5:13:01] <+spacehouse> Cloud Missed
[5:13:03] <DaiRyuseii> Nomura'd
[5:13:05] <waifoong98> yes
[5:13:07] <Trinity5> i thought people have been doing that for years lol
[5:13:09] <DaiRyuseii> Sounds good to me
[5:13:09] <+PleasantLee> ok, hmm
[5:13:10] <+justianxix> I wish
[5:13:16] <%bettysharkface> Oh fuck off
[5:13:16] <shevan123> lack of brevity?
[5:13:17] <kingra> I like that the sword you have is different in cutscenes
[5:13:20] <JoeBecomesJoe> But we already have Kojumbo
[5:13:21] <smugfox95> Im down for that
[5:13:22] <DaiRyuseii> So much of that scene wasn't necessary
[5:13:23] <+OranHexthief> i mean nomura wasn't the writer on this game he was director
[5:13:31] <+PleasantLee> "wow, I just read twilight and I've never seen worse nomura in my life"
[5:13:32] <+crowmium> Seemed very Michael Bay
[5:13:33] <mrgaster8> dont we all ready do that
[5:13:33] <+PleasantLee> yeah it works
[5:13:35] <Whyverns> Nomura is the ultimate 8 year old
[5:13:41] <+EpicureanIguana> trash writing and belt/zipper fetish
[5:13:43] <sad_toast_> ""nomura moment""
[5:13:44] <vonmaultke> Yes, this got Nomura’ed
[5:13:50] <+PleasantLee> PROTECT THAT SMILE
[5:13:55] <Trinity5> PROTECC
[5:13:56] <MilkingEdge> WE JUST GOT NOMURAED
[5:13:57] <Medo3G> gotta hide the B
[5:13:58] <kingra> <3
[5:14:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> LEGOSHI SMILE
[5:14:01] <%bettysharkface> Aw
[5:14:07] <%bettysharkface> Aw poor Red noooo baby
[5:14:10] <TheLucidChiba> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[5:14:14] <BillieNoMates> The Time Jannies are doing something again
[5:14:14] <london_flexing> depends if it feels like he wrote it. ALOT of shit writers out there. Remember David Cage
[5:14:15] <%Samex_Comex> Ghosts!
[5:14:15] <mrgaster8> yaaaaaaaaaaa
[5:14:16] <smugfox95> ok red is cute
[5:14:17] <Trinity5> here we go baby
[5:14:17] <seth45er> you predicted this!
[5:14:18] <availablethor> what are they up to now?
[5:14:18] <Ophiuchas> Barret and red ard so cute
[5:14:28] <Whyverns> THIS WHOLE BUILDING ISNT CANON ANYMORE
[5:14:28] <Trinity5> just oozing with nomura
[5:14:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It's about to get all stupid up in here
[5:14:32] <DaiRyuseii> Nomura mold
[5:14:34] <kiwicoffin> The writers might come up with the scenarios but the director decides how we experience them
[5:14:36] <sad_toast_> millions of plot Ghosts 😵
[5:14:38] <Trinity5> no the building is extra canon, now
[5:14:40] <+OnTheDonner> I've beaten the game, and I have no idea what the ghosts are doing
[5:14:40] <jo_vo> Nomura has to fellate the tower
[5:14:41] <+justianxix> The ghost are like: FUCK! PLOT IS FUCKED!
[5:14:43] <GilliamYaeger> Now you have the highway and THE NOMURA DIMENSION
[5:14:45] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA GHOST
[5:14:47] <Medo3G> there's a reason they don't allow you to record this
[5:14:47] <+crowmium> I don't remember ff7s plot that well apparently
[5:14:47] <theloganbrand> I heard some bad things about this chapter
[5:14:58] <+PleasantLee> nomura is at the base of the shinra hq, best over, pants on ankles, unleashing an unending wave of fart gas in a howling swirling vortex
[5:15:01] <mrgaster8> about that
[5:15:05] <availablethor> The canon is fine though. The ghost are overreacting.
[5:15:09] <vonmaultke> Nomura ghosting the Shinra building
[5:15:13] <JoeBecomesJoe> Nah those whispers are the fans, getting angry about stuff not being canon
[5:15:15] <Trinity5> pyreflies
[5:15:16] <sosandstorm> ... so time clansmen
[5:15:19] <Dalthine> They look like dementors.
[5:15:19] <+EpicureanIguana> they should all have Nomura's face instead
[5:15:20] <Medo3G> harry potter dementors
[5:15:21] <jo_vo> They look like Heartless Nocturnes/ Operas, w/e
[5:15:23] <smugfox95> Halloween decorations
[5:15:25] <Trinity5> @sosandstorm bruh LUL
[5:15:32] <+PleasantLee> DO IT
[5:15:35] <Huntercd> Complete global saturation
[5:15:38] <examplez0> Dew it
[5:15:39] <Ophiuchas> do it!!
[5:15:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> Cosplay
[5:15:41] <mrgaster8> do it
[5:15:42] <+PleasantLee> DO IT!
[5:15:42] <+crowmium> do it you won't
[5:15:44] <Ophiuchas> awww
[5:15:45] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Timeline is fine but events aren't. So like purists, they go rabid insane
[5:15:45] <Eger007> do the ghost cosplay
[5:15:47] <%bettysharkface> Aw boo
[5:15:48] <+spacehouse> TIME GHOST COSPLAY
[5:15:50] <MilkingEdge> They should be nomura
[5:15:53] <+spacehouse> GENIUS
[5:15:56] <+PleasantLee> why'd you bring it up, you obviously want to do it
[5:15:57] <GilliamYaeger> God damn I hate Rufus's stupid belt skirt
[5:16:00] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> give us the time jannie cosplay
[5:16:04] <sad_toast_> makes it that much more "Nomura'
[5:16:05] <Canadian312> Acquire plot armor
[5:16:10] <availablethor> Huh
[5:16:12] <DaiRyuseii> These ghosts are sucking away the good writing
[5:16:13] <BillieNoMates> Plot relevant people only see the ghosts
[5:16:15] <+PleasantLee> too many belts
[5:16:20] <availablethor> So Rufus can see them, but Tseng can not?
[5:16:23] <vonmaultke> DansGame belt skirt
[5:16:24] <Trinity5> yeah @availablethor
[5:16:25] <Medo3G> not enough belts
[5:16:26] <Huntercd> Could they see the time ghosts?
[5:16:28] <Trinity5> that's what the scene is getting at
[5:16:28] <BillieNoMates> He didnt even have that in AC
[5:16:29] <mrgaster8> hmmmm
[5:16:30] <+PleasantLee> I hate it so much I might do a redesign
[5:16:32] <BillieNoMates> He just wore a suit
[5:16:34] <MilkingEdge> IT'S SO NOMURA
[5:16:41] <%bettysharkface> He had a chat with Lulu?
[5:16:41] <gunsrlove> Only plot people can see ghosts, Tseng and normies cannot
[5:16:42] <Ophiuchas> his original long coat was elegant and tailored
[5:16:43] <%LordSDB> He got A kh coat one,look at all thos belts
[5:16:49] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> More belts = more status
[5:16:53] <+shootbang_exe> Nomura...moron...Nomoron?
[5:16:55] <Trinity5> what ARE they doing
[5:16:56] <availablethor> I like how he's like "I guess I'm crazy, better not talk about it"
[5:17:04] <BillieNoMates> Wedge is fighting all of them
[5:17:05] <Monstergelo> it's for all the dogs that died for him
[5:17:06] <GilliamYaeger> This is Nomoronic
[5:17:12] <Trinity5> @BillieNoMates eating*
[5:17:14] <mrgaster8> hes fine
[5:17:14] <DaiRyuseii> Wedge will eat his way out of the building
[5:17:15] <shevan123> is it wedge?
[5:17:19] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> it doesnt make sense but thats ok because visualsssss
[5:17:26] <Huntercd> Just give him a dress if its going to be that long and dumb
[5:17:26] <+PleasantLee> this is the start of the confusion
[5:17:27] <FrostedZaibatsu> I hated what they did to Wedge
[5:17:31] <Ophiuchas> 🤫 wait and see
[5:17:32] <smugfox95> theyre swooshing
[5:17:33] <availablethor> Oh, right, Wedge is alive, that's not canon.
[5:17:36] <+KawaiiJetty> The ghosts are eating Wedge
[5:17:42] <+PleasantLee> but it doesnt make sense apparently. had to watch a video about it
[5:17:43] <BillieNoMates> Wedge is too powerful so they need to kill him
[5:17:44] <+KawaiiJetty> takes time though
[5:17:45] <Trinity5> they need that many ghosts to stop wedge
[5:17:49] <Trinity5> he's so fucking fat
[5:17:50] <Huntercd> Why would they need some many ghost for Wedge?
[5:17:51] <gunsrlove> Wedge is eating the ghosts
[5:17:53] <GilliamYaeger> Roche never appears again
[5:17:59] <mrgaster8> @KawaiiJetty haha
[5:17:59] <GilliamYaeger> He shows up exactly once
[5:18:00] <DaiRyuseii> NO PLAYABLE BIKECHASE?
[5:18:02] <BillieNoMates> But Wedge is the single largest reservoir of life energy possible
[5:18:08] <Trinity5> twice @GilliamYaeger
[5:18:10] <vonmaultke> Ghosts are seducing Wedge
[5:18:14] <Medo3G> this is some road rash BS
[5:18:24] <examplez0> We Advent Children now
[5:18:26] <+AnthraxJohnson> These guys cant aim for shit
[5:18:31] <vonmaultke> With a bacon double cheese
[5:18:31] <examplez0> Controls are in the top left anyway
[5:18:35] <seth45er> don't worry i saw their parachutes!
[5:18:35] <Ophiuchas> controls top left
[5:18:46] <Trinity5> is cloud like kiryu
[5:18:50] <Trinity5> does he never kill anyone ever
[5:18:53] <+PleasantLee> this bike sequence is alot better than the first
[5:19:00] <Ophiuchas> better
[5:19:05] <gunsrlove> no
[5:19:05] <BlueEyesWhiteFatass> red hates it
[5:19:08] <+justianxix> Kiryu has never killed anyone. ANYONE
[5:19:11] <Trinity5> on new game plus you can skip the first oen @PleasantLee
[5:19:15] <Trinity5> one*
[5:19:21] <gunsrlove> Cloud is never as cool as Kiyiu
[5:19:25] <+PleasantLee> yeah but its date time with jessie ya know
[5:19:28] <gunsrlove> Kiryu*
[5:19:30] <Trinity5> i feel that
[5:19:34] <+PleasantLee> I aint gonna turn that down
[5:19:36] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Unless you want that trophy for Jessie, yeah you can skip
[5:19:39] <mrgaster8> got to admit this bit fun
[5:19:42] <%caramello_man> Nah saejima didn;t kill anyone lol
[5:20:00] <gnollAUS> They are pushing you forward despite the fact you were going that way anyway. Like them just popping up to yell at you. "Hey, don't buy mini carrots at the store today." Just look at them. "Was not planning to but thanks for telling me anyway." Levels of dipshitery
[5:20:04] <Trinity5> why is the camera so close?
[5:20:06] <Ophiuchas> this but was fun but it went on a bit
[5:20:07] <gnollAUS> The ghosts are
[5:20:47] <jo_vo> THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN ON THESE MILES AND MILES OF HIGHWAY
[5:20:52] <Dalthine> ...They really called the motorcycle a Hardy-Daytona?
[5:20:58] <Zinax7> i wish you could ride the ghosts
[5:21:02] <Zinax7> while on the motorcycle
[5:21:05] <+PleasantLee> it was called that in the original too
[5:21:06] <Trinity5> i get big fast and furious 5 vibes run these big segments
[5:21:08] <Zinax7> so we can fly
[5:21:11] <examplez0> HARDY DAYTONA LET'S GO AWAY
[5:21:11] <Trinity5> how fucking long are these highways
[5:21:15] <%caramello_man> That 3 wheeler is not designed to go 120 kph, it would fucking eat shit
[5:21:15] <Eger007> is it reference to harley davidson?
[5:21:23] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Harley Davidson + Daytona USA maybe?
[5:21:25] <BillieNoMates> our shields will stop this 200mph truck
[5:21:45] <umbilicalsky9> what were the soldiers going to do if we slammed into them
[5:21:53] <Trinity5> you know if you could switch to tifa and barrett in the car, that actually would've been kinda neat
[5:21:57] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[5:21:58] <Trinity5> he did
[5:22:02] <+PleasantLee> the dog pushed drugs on you
[5:22:03] <mrgaster8> yea
[5:22:03] <shevan123> good dog
[5:22:03] <BillieNoMates> best dog
[5:22:04] <waifoong98> good pupper
[5:22:05] <Ophiuchas> scooby snacks
[5:22:06] <Trinity5> one drugs, please
[5:22:06] <Daskolin> He is good boi
[5:22:08] <+justianxix> Dog Drugs
[5:22:09] <Monstergelo> @umbilicalsky9 makes them guilty of murder
[5:22:15] <TheWe4pon> Drug Dog
[5:22:26] <Zulrez> goodest doggo, giving you drugs while you operate heavy machinery
[5:22:29] <NineBall3D> dog-cat nip
[5:22:33] <Trinity5> red xiii got into the gysahl greens again
[5:22:34] <Huntercd> yes
[5:22:39] <gnollAUS> YES
[5:22:43] <DaiRyuseii> Motorball incoming
[5:22:58] <BillieNoMates> Motorballu
[5:23:19] <DaiRyuseii> They better have kept its name. Motorball is one of the cooler bosses in ff7
[5:23:22] <Trinity5> yeah this part of the segment didnt' need to happen honestly
[5:23:34] <+PleasantLee> imagine how butt hurt cloud must have been to leave the hardy daytona behind at the end of the highway
[5:23:49] <+spacehouse> welcome to the longest highway in the final fantasy multiverse
[5:23:53] <examplez0> DAYTONA
[5:23:56] <examplez0> LET'S GO AWAY
[5:23:56] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> It slightly bothers me that the ball isn't actually moving
[5:24:11] <vonmaultke> The original would be done by now Jebaited
[5:24:24] <smugfox95> Has there even been any turn offs from this hiighway?
[5:24:30] <Trinity5> i like how aerith, tifa and barret have combat barks but aren't doing shit
[5:24:30] <vonmaultke> No
[5:24:31] <DaiRyuseii> Yeah even Motorball would have been done by now
[5:25:04] <Trinity5> the little slug ray that could
[5:25:05] <%caramello_man> aww he got a hit in tho
[5:25:17] <Trinity5> MORE DRUGS
[5:25:20] <BillieNoMates> more dog drugs
[5:26:02] <DaiRyuseii> I'd think they'd be done with WARNING SHOTS By now
[5:26:09] <MilkingEdge> GET TO TTHA CHOPPA
[5:26:16] <Dalthine> So wait. This is how things were supposed to go, but the whole party would have just died there?
[5:26:21] <BillieNoMates> SOLDIER BIKE FIGHT
[5:26:29] <NineBall3D> time ghosts are actually from a fanfic?
[5:26:40] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA FANFIC
[5:26:43] <DaiRyuseii> Yeah this game is a fanfic
[5:26:46] <waifoong98> basically
[5:27:11] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> No, certain things have caused a ripple effect going forward, so some events are starting to change. The ghosts are trying to preserver the OG timeline
[5:27:26] <majeser> I liked this segment from the original but it's kinda dragging a bit.
[5:27:38] <TheWe4pon> wish they would do their job better then.
[5:27:47] <waifoong98> @majeser it will drag even more then you want then
[5:28:00] <Trinity5> yeah it ain't done yet lol
[5:28:29] <%caramello_man> good job plague you fuckwit
[5:28:29] <BillieNoMates> time ghosts save us again
[5:28:32] <BillieNoMates> Can't breach canon
[5:28:38] <%Samex_Comex> With the power of RAGE!!
[5:28:44] <%caramello_man> omg i said plague when i meant cloud
[5:28:49] <+EpicureanIguana> oh boy
[5:28:52] <Dalthine> Dalthine subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:28:53] <+justianxix> Fucking Destiny
[5:28:55] <DaiRyuseii> MOTORBALL TIME
[5:29:05] <+PleasantLee> aeris gave him the good pets
[5:29:14] <+PleasantLee> hehehe
[5:29:24] <Trinity5> never gonna ignore that red called barret a 300 pound sack of shit LUL
[5:29:25] <+PleasantLee> love that. calls his a giant sack of shit
[5:29:28] <smugfox95> its just banter dont get mad
[5:29:28] <+KawaiiJetty> Red how do you explain this in Cosmo Canyon
[5:29:30] <MilkingEdge> AERIS UNLOCKED HIS INNER NOMURA
[5:29:31] <kiwicoffin> I assume Aerith infected Marlene with plot knowledge too
[5:29:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:29:38] <+PleasantLee> red a sassy boy like all red heads
[5:29:44] <Huntercd> Head pats let him read the script
[5:29:51] <TheWe4pon> aeirth show red the script
[5:30:02] <TheWe4pon> godammit
[5:30:06] <smugfox95> I want this section to end its so boring
[5:30:14] <Medo3G> stagger that car
[5:30:32] <waifoong98> another hp sponge
[5:30:34] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes Aerith does know, you've just been filtering that for some reason. When she proposes to save Marlene, she shouldn't even know Marlene's name. Aerith is totally the Rei of this Rebuild.
[5:31:08] <Medo3G> !uptime
[5:31:08] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds
[5:31:24] <seth45er> they haven't even mentioned that they should leave the city
[5:31:26] <Zulrez> pretty sure she hears tifa say marlene while they are in the warehouse
[5:31:36] <TheWe4pon> maybe its so fucking stupid
[5:32:18] <kiwicoffin> You never know what's supposed to be happening in real time or in the character's head when flashbacks happen
[5:32:21] <+EpicureanIguana> Its the time ghosts again, looping us infinitely until we kill the boss and complete canon
[5:32:22] <availablethor> She also shows Cloud an alternative way into the sector, for no reason, which into canon, and then the team uses that to go back and find Wedge.
[5:32:35] <umbilicalsky9> this boss feels like such a filler
[5:32:52] <gnollAUS> Each time less of its wheels work
[5:33:07] <availablethor> Aerith and Sephiroth/Jenova are both Q-ing this.
[5:33:15] <+PleasantLee> I love all these dumb mecha designs, and then I realise Scarlet is incharge of R&D and must be a sentai fan herself
[5:33:48] <Trinity5> scarlet is actually the biggest nerd
[5:34:08] <kiwicoffin> We have no money to go to space, but giant big wheels with arm cannons?
[5:34:15] <availablethor> @Trinity5 I accept that headcanon as fact.
[5:34:30] <+KawaiiJetty> I mean, this is supposed to be the final boss of Midgar section in original,no?
[5:34:44] <availablethor> Yes.
[5:34:46] <TheWe4pon> yes
[5:35:15] <sad_toast_> do da spin
[5:35:22] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @kiwicoffin makes more sense then you think. Money tends to be spent on military assets more than anything else. Just look at real life for that. Especially during/around wartime
[5:35:48] <sad_toast_> I think Red 13 will heal you???
[5:35:50] <+PleasantLee> I love her, sure hope she isnt violenrly stabbed one day
[5:35:56] <kiwicoffin> @Dunder_Mifflinz Oh yeah I forgot there was a war involved in all this
[5:36:02] <Trinity5> i wiped here too
[5:36:11] <Trinity5> luckily it just starts you at the boss
[5:36:14] <sad_toast_> if you get close to truck I think they heal you 🤔
[5:36:18] <TheWe4pon> Jesus, no checkpoint
[5:36:44] <umbilicalsky9> press [options] to skip battle!
[5:38:06] <mrgaster8> @TheWe4pon just you wait it gets wores
[5:39:29] <TheWe4pon> it's just that this boss is such a time waster boss
[5:39:31] <gensoukaizou> This game is so much fun
[5:40:33] <Trinity5> yeah this segment in general is just unnecessarily long
[5:41:18] <waifoong98> how much worse would this be in hardmode
[5:41:18] <penitentpentwitch> The boss design problem of 'invincibility phases'
[5:41:49] <Ophiuchas> good riddance
[5:41:49] <Matrixvingian> Nice of Shinra to clear the highways for this epic battle.
[5:41:50] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> The problem is that sword is a little weak, Buster maxed has 75/75 attack with some defences while Twin has 58/58. You just lose 1 materia slot
[5:41:53] <kiwicoffin> Finally we can let Nomura get us to the next set piece
[5:42:06] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> 2*
[5:42:20] <smugfox95> Remember that time clud couldnt cut through a door?
[5:42:33] <BillieNoMates> Hi Cloud. Been 5 minutes
[5:42:35] <Matrixvingian> SepeRICK
[5:42:38] <Ophiuchas> da da daaaaaaa!
[5:42:39] <GilliamYaeger> time to enter the nomura dimension, where nomura is law
[5:42:45] <examplez0> This is it
[5:42:50] <waifoong98> oh boy
[5:42:53] <examplez0> THIS is when the game goes completely batshit
[5:42:54] <+PleasantLee> here we go
[5:42:54] <waifoong98> here goes nothing
[5:42:57] <ovan20> Now we use nostalgia to push our new story into the weebs Kappa
[5:42:59] <+PleasantLee> get all your shit in order
[5:43:03] <Zinax7> so apparently max doesn't see the problem in the story and nomura blaming
[5:43:03] <Medo3G> sword
[5:43:07] <Medo3G> change your sword
[5:43:07] <Zinax7> cuz nomura is not the writer
[5:43:13] <bluefooddye1> Oh it's way beyond stupid
[5:43:13] <penitentpentwitch> Hard save
[5:43:17] <+PleasantLee> do all your materia and weapons and thingie
[5:43:20] <BillieNoMates> Theres a bench and vendor
[5:43:20] <sad_toast_> get ready ...
[5:43:21] <Ophiuchas> keep an eye out for the menu icon during cutscene
[5:43:26] <gazdropish> REALLY stupid part
[5:43:28] <+thefakeh> save
[5:43:29] <BillieNoMates> Thats been the marker for bullshit
[5:43:29] <+spacehouse> no no, use ur bike to crush sephy
[5:43:30] <kingra> Kappa
[5:43:35] <Ophiuchas> it's easy to miss
[5:43:38] <+PleasantLee> you do have 1 more chance after this coming cutscene
[5:43:44] <examplez0> Now this is where Nomura wanks Sephiroth harder than ever
[5:43:44] <kiwicoffin> Nomura is like a conductor who gives zero fucks the notes on the page
[5:43:48] <gensoukaizou> it's a deep remaking of the story!
[5:43:55] <ovan20> I'm an artisty...i can't just make a remake...i'll improve it Keepo
[5:43:57] <waifoong98> lol
[5:43:57] <Huntercd> So Barret and dog still have no idea who Sephoroth?
[5:44:05] <sad_toast_> 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[5:44:15] <BillieNoMates> So why would you stop driving?
[5:44:16] <Trinity5> @ovan20 i mean i'd be fine with it if they actually y'know
[5:44:17] <gazdropish> i don't understand why some people are excited about the changes
[5:44:19] <Trinity5> improved it
[5:44:19] <Zinax7> i would like to see a podcast ff7 remake discussion between you and pat or max
[5:44:20] <waifoong98> @Huntercd honestly, nobody but Cloud does lol
[5:44:22] <Djinnazz> i sure he has writers.
[5:44:24] <Eger007> ouuu plague you'll LOVE this
[5:44:26] <+PleasantLee> yet
[5:44:27] <Ophiuchas> maybe he feels like he made it he can unmake it
[5:44:28] <DaiRyuseii> HAHAHAHAHAHAH
[5:44:28] <GilliamYaeger> He's going to have it
[5:44:30] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Certain cutscenes give you a chance to enter the equip menu, just hit square when it shows in the bottom left
[5:44:31] <KattenBertil> HAHAHAH
[5:44:31] <availablethor> Ahahaha
[5:44:35] <silvcrest> he doesn't know
[5:44:36] <examplez0> Just wait
[5:44:36] <Whyverns> JUST WAIT FOR HIM TO GROW IT
[5:44:37] <Zulrez> @waifoong98 doesnt tifa know him though?
[5:44:42] <ovan20> because cool visuals Keepo
[5:44:43] <DaiRyuseii> HE DOESN'T KNOW
[5:44:43] <sad_toast_> how much of a butt head you gotta be 😆
[5:44:44] <seth45er> he's part bird
[5:44:45] <+OranHexthief> i m4ean that would be funny for the meme @PlagueOfGripes but nojima the original creator wrote all of this and is writing the next piece
[5:44:47] <Matrixvingian> BISHI hitting the fan.
[5:44:54] <%caramello_man> they know sepiroth is a war hero
[5:44:57] <waifoong98> @Zulrez hmmm, yeah may be her
[5:45:01] <BillieNoMates> Inb4 Aerith just headbutts him
[5:45:03] <Shardlab> But Nomura didn't write this. Nojima did.
[5:45:06] <smugfox95> All that driving and youre like a mile from shinra tower
[5:45:06] <mrgaster8> big wrong
[5:45:06] <GilliamYaeger> @OranHexthief Nojima is also the guy who wrote FFX 2.5
[5:45:07] <Huntercd> And not in a good way
[5:45:11] <+justianxix> All he says is gibberish
[5:45:13] <sosandstorm> well.... she's right about that
[5:45:14] <+EpicureanIguana> she is right Pog
[5:45:17] <gensoukaizou> clouded eyes? old ff7 fans?
[5:45:19] <examplez0> "Everything about you is wrong" yep that sounds about right
[5:45:19] <+OranHexthief> correct and dirge @GilliamYaeger
[5:45:24] <GilliamYaeger> KINGDOM HEARTS INTENSIFIES
[5:45:26] <MilkingEdge> EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU YOU IS NOMURA
[5:45:28] <Hydrapissed> comfyUhh
[5:45:31] <+AnthraxJohnson> Strap in boys
[5:45:32] <+PleasantLee> THE FART GHOSTS, OMG
[5:45:38] <KattenBertil> A recent interview stated that Nomura had a big hand in the story
[5:45:39] <Huntercd> What are they talking about?
[5:45:40] <shevan123> NOMURA NO
[5:45:41] <ovan20> @PlagueOfGripes where did Sephirot came from? did i miss a chapter?
[5:45:45] <gazdropish> @don't you know? they said the did this because now everyone knows who Sephiroth is. So they can't slowly build him up anymore LUL
[5:45:51] <Zinax7> @PlagueOfGripes max said that nomura is not the writer so he's not held responsible
[5:45:51] <Ophiuchas> the music is as bombastic as the dialogue
[5:45:55] <kingra> David ca- I mean Nomura is here
[5:45:55] <GilliamYaeger> @ovan20 he came from the future
[5:45:55] <BillieNoMates> The time jannies are trying to ban him
[5:45:55] <kiwicoffin> Just hit that bitch with a zettaflare
[5:46:00] <sad_toast_> Gawrdh
[5:46:01] <MartiusGW> where donald?
[5:46:05] <Eger007> this game is KH ff7 segment made into a game
[5:46:08] <Trinity5> HERE WE GO
[5:46:14] <GilliamYaeger> TIME FOR THE WORST RETCON EVER

[5:46:35] <Hydrapissed> yo whos that guy chat
[5:46:36] <mrgaster8> no idea
[5:46:36] <Shardlab> Welcome to Crisis Core
[5:46:39] <noremac0uo> whoooooo
[5:46:39] <Hydrapissed> whats he do?
[5:46:41] <+EpicureanIguana> Who was this made for? Fans hate this wank material and new people dont even know whats going on
[5:46:42] <ovan20> this i Zack, i never played FF7 but i watched the prequel anime
[5:46:45] <%bettysharkface> Uhh, Nathan...
[5:46:52] <Sunstalker> Is that regular Cloud, not super saiyin? Pog
[5:46:52] <Matrixvingian> Aren't those PHatnoms from A Spirit Within?
[5:46:52] <EcoFreak07> More shitty writing
[5:46:54] <MartiusGW> crisis core babe
[5:47:01] <availablethor> Yeah this make no sense whatsoever.
[5:47:02] <+PleasantLee> nomura really made this game like no one in the world HADNT played the original game and crisis core and all that other bs
[5:47:03] <Whyverns> crisis core sucks ass
[5:47:07] <BillieNoMates> So why is he not a fucked up mess thatt can barely move Cloud?
[5:47:08] <waifoong98> also they retconned the sword again
[5:47:10] <DaiRyuseii> SHOOT HIM ALREADY
[5:47:10] <+KawaiiJetty> He's Zack from Kingdom Hearts where he tries to bang Aqua
[5:47:13] <Ophiuchas> dark hair light skin = east Asian
[5:47:17] <gazdropish> why are there time ghosts if this is alternate universe
[5:47:18] <MilkingEdge> GONGAGA
[5:47:18] <noremac0uo> yikes his voice
[5:47:19] <Matrixvingian> OH no.. dreams.
[5:47:27] <sad_toast_> shhhhh🤫 representation
[5:47:27] <+PleasantLee> hojo nicked his materia
[5:47:31] <GilliamYaeger> He doesn't need materia, he has slot machines
[5:47:31] <cyberblueneon> freedom isnt free
[5:47:31] <gunsrlove> He's vaguely race-less, possibly asian
[5:47:32] <kiwicoffin> His base stats are so good
[5:47:34] <MilkingEdge> COME AND GET SOME
[5:47:37] <sosandstorm> so we just... get to "know" about that?
[5:47:42] <BillieNoMates> Not the time jannies!
[5:47:43] <Tikigod784> he's vergil
[5:47:44] <GilliamYaeger> SEPHIROTH OPENS A PORTAL TO NOMURALAND
[5:47:44] <mrgaster8> virgil
[5:47:44] <Zinax7> man i hate how it has to be either you're a purist for not liking the ending, or nomura dick sucker for liking it
[5:47:45] <availablethor> Vergil sword, of course
[5:47:46] <Hydrapissed> hes number is HUGE!
[5:47:49] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> We starting to get into it now!
[5:47:50] <shevan123> hey vergil
[5:47:53] <Apolonm> Nomura atpSuspect
[5:47:58] <+PleasantLee> I hate that, sephiroth jsut straight up doing a vergil dimensional slice
[5:47:59] <ovan20> @gazdropish because time is changing and the ghosts are trying to stop it...i think.
[5:48:02] <TheWe4pon> did he just cut dimensions?
[5:48:07] <Matrixvingian> What's the issues with the magic dude?
[5:48:08] <Tikigod784> did they make sephiroth gay this time
[5:48:11] <waifoong98> now time for bullshit dimension
[5:48:12] <seth45er> you'd think sepi would want things to play out different
[5:48:18] <Hydrapissed> I mean the sex part would be awesome
[5:48:19] <GilliamYaeger> @Tikigod784 he is extremely gay in this game
[5:48:20] <smugfox95> sephiroth sounds like his VA hasnt slept in a week
[5:48:21] <+Ataerus> @Tikigod784 this time? xD
[5:48:23] <+NukeDaHippies> This is so dumb
[5:48:25] <GilliamYaeger> He walked straight out of a yaoi doujin
[5:48:29] <+KawaiiJetty> But tbh Zack/Cloud first meeting in Crisis Core was nice
[5:48:32] <gensoukaizou> no don't go!
[5:48:36] <sad_toast_> he's basically asking you to fallow him
[5:48:36] <examplez0> Prepare yourself for more Nomura dialogue
[5:48:39] <Tikigod784> 1997 was too early for anything except vague implications, but this time he's pretty blatant about it
[5:48:48] <DaiRyuseii> Wondering if Aeris created this alternate timeline or some shit
[5:48:49] <+AnthraxJohnson> “I see your cock is as big as mine”
[5:48:52] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Yeah! break out of that canon timeline!
[5:48:53] <+EpicureanIguana> stop this NotLikeThis
[5:48:55] <ovan20> Aerith is our plot device in this scene
[5:48:56] <Tikigod784> although since it's Jenova, it's not gay
[5:48:57] <examplez0> She's the Kairi and Namine rolled into one
[5:49:00] <availablethor> By the way if anyone still doubts that Aerith knows what's going on, just listen to this scene.
[5:49:01] <Eger007> save the wifu
[5:49:04] <+OnTheDonner> She made it white. that means it was a good thing that she did
[5:49:06] <GilliamYaeger> Why does Aeris know all this shit? She had no idea what was going on in the original
[5:49:08] <+PleasantLee> someone could pull out a fucking key blade right now and do the world locking animation thing and no one in the game would bat an eyelash
[5:49:08] <%caramello_man> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[5:49:09] <Hydrapissed> aerith can see all the TIME LINES
[5:49:10] <Hydrapissed> calling it
[5:49:11] <Matrixvingian> Shinra's not reacting to a fuck huge hughway portal?
[5:49:14] <gazdropish> destiny is destiny though
[5:49:14] <Medo3G> is that the script on the floor
[5:49:14] <+rhydwings> useless white materia does it again
[5:49:14] <+justianxix> Destiny this, Fate that, fuck this shit
[5:49:16] <GilliamYaeger> Because Nomura
[5:49:19] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> nomura isnt sure either tbf
[5:49:19] <BillieNoMates> Because he's the sacred cow
[5:49:21] <sosandstorm> it's crazy how different the dialogue feels when the characters are talking to each other vs ABOUT THE PLOT
[5:49:22] <noremac0uo> is this what the game is? just sephiroth appears, makes everyone trip balls and then leaves? then no one says anything?
[5:49:25] <Hydrapissed> yep
[5:49:27] <Eger007> because fuck you that's why
[5:49:28] <Matrixvingian> The GTA Sandbox Dimension.
[5:49:31] <Tikigod784> It's not gay if it's a Jenova
[5:49:31] <gunsrlove> Is that Plague's PS4 making the big noise in the background or what?
[5:49:32] <examplez0> Because he's too cool and awesome and epic and he can just cut them with his masamune
[5:49:34] <shevan123> nomura plz
[5:49:38] <Huntercd> What is going on?
[5:49:38] <Verdenfert> every particle effect is bits of the script
[5:49:39] <gensoukaizou> sephiroth has a dick too big for destiny
[5:49:40] <+EpicureanIguana> just stab her already DansGame
[5:49:44] <+NukeDaHippies> As soon as the filler content starts the writing takes a NOSE DIVE
[5:49:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:49:51] <DaiRyuseii> The Black Wind Howls
[5:50:06] <Medo3G> it's meant to evoke emoshun
[5:50:06] <Matrixvingian> I would love to see a character in game call Sephiroth out on that.
[5:50:10] <DaiRyuseii> *Words with more meaning despite having much less lines*
[5:50:13] <examplez0> What the fuck is she even saying at this point
[5:50:14] <Huntercd> Why is this destiny shit here?
[5:50:24] <TheWe4pon> man Tseng really needed to back hand her.
[5:50:27] <BillieNoMates> For fucks sake. I don't even dislike the whole time ghosts thing but Nomura can't write for shit
[5:50:30] <+NukeDaHippies> WHy is she talking liek she knows him!?
[5:50:31] <kiwicoffin> If we don't kill Sephiroth, this game won't get a sequel
[5:50:31] <Hydrapissed> wait what
[5:50:32] <Trinity5> i wanna this like
[5:50:33] <Hydrapissed> how?
[5:50:33] <sosandstorm> she might as well hold a megaphone right now
[5:50:35] <Trinity5> the planet speaking through aerith
[5:50:37] <Tikigod784> Aeris did a fusion dance with her future self
[5:50:40] <Matrixvingian> What the hell Flower Girl?
[5:50:42] <Eger007> what are you saying
[5:50:43] <Hydrapissed> she shouldnt know this
[5:50:43] <Trinity5> because it doesn't SOUND like her?
[5:50:44] <seth45er> there is alot more elipsies when nomura dialogue
[5:50:48] <Sergiroth> It's just bullshit fluff dialogue.
[5:50:51] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA IS THE THREAT
[5:50:52] <+EpicureanIguana> NotLikeThis what is this nonsense
[5:50:53] <BillieNoMates> He did. He claimed the planet was sacred and that it was the Ancients
[5:50:54] <Tikigod784> just like Nomura peed all over this game
[5:50:58] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> See if the story changes were well-written with meaning behind it then Id be game, but this is vapid
[5:51:00] <mrgaster8> flat earth
[5:51:02] <+NukeDaHippies> Sephiroth doesn't even know who cloud IS when he first meets him
[5:51:04] <Hydrapissed> she can see timeline bs watch
[5:51:06] <smugfox95> shut up aerith just let anime boy fight the katana man
[5:51:06] <examplez0> She's a magical space fairy it just works
[5:51:06] <sad_toast_> ""he's actually a good guy or something""
[5:51:10] <sosandstorm> CHANGING MORE THAN FATE
[5:51:12] <waifoong98> she is a fortune teller bc hurdur the plots needs one
[5:51:14] <Matrixvingian> Wait what? They're gonna be rewriting her damn fate?
[5:51:14] <MartiusGW> but in ac he wanted to use planet as space ship?
[5:51:16] <Verdenfert> but then *why* stop cloud in the first place?!
[5:51:16] <Tikigod784> Sephiroth joining the party confirmed
[5:51:21] <DaiRyuseii> God this is so fucking shit
[5:51:22] <kiwicoffin> REEEE
[5:51:23] <gnollAUS> She is just mumbling about dumb shit.
[5:51:36] <+AnthraxJohnson> Jesus christ just go through the portal
[5:51:37] <DaiRyuseii> Time ghosts are screaming to get on with it
[5:51:39] <Matrixvingian> "You said it yourself" Plague.
[5:51:40] <gazdropish> deeestiny
[5:51:45] <gazdropish> faaaaate
[5:51:53] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> because he is wroooooong
[5:51:54] <Daskolin> NOMURA MUST BE STOPPED!
[5:51:54] <kiwicoffin> Didn't he just fuck off to another dimension? So what's the issue
[5:51:54] <gazdropish> kill me someone
[5:51:55] <Matrixvingian> Wait wasn't time travel FF8?
[5:51:56] <+justianxix> I really hate how destiny and fate is the main story now, its shit
[5:52:01] <Hydrapissed> lol
[5:52:01] <waifoong98> @Matrixvingian it is
[5:52:04] <Medo3G> stop using the shit sword
[5:52:05] <gnollAUS> Mumble grumble toil and fumble
[5:52:09] <Tikigod784> FF8 was time compression
[5:52:09] <sad_toast_> "we gotta stop Nomura"
[5:52:11] <sosandstorm> "the vending machine will have everything you need"
[5:52:12] <ovan20> Plague literally pissed off LUL
[5:52:14] <TheWe4pon> FF7;RREEEEEEEEEE
[5:52:18] <GilliamYaeger> >Strange and terrible things may be waiting on the other side Hell yeah, Nomura's writing is both strange AND terrible
[5:52:19] <Tikigod784> FF7 is Time Ghosts
[5:52:20] <Matrixvingian> So there's Time Witches in our Alien Lavos invader story?
[5:52:24] <waifoong98> @Matrixvingian it is even dumber, all the character came from the same orphanage, yet none of them remember lol
[5:52:25] <gnollAUS> This game is so bad
[5:52:29] <gnollAUS> What even is the story
[5:52:29] <$jamarartdoodles> Yes Time compression in FF8
[5:52:33] <BillieNoMates> I still think they should have given this game to Yoko Taro and let him have his way with it
[5:52:34] <gazdropish> this is so stupid
[5:52:35] <penitentpentwitch> All hail the Ultimate Vending Machine!
[5:52:42] <Tikigod784> @BillieNoMates yes
[5:52:46] <Tikigod784> that
[5:52:47] <sad_toast_> yeah yeah FF 7 REEEmake
[5:52:49] <Matrixvingian> Is the vending machine the new MArauder Shields?
[5:52:49] <GilliamYaeger> I want Yoko Taro to do this to Drakengard 1
[5:52:53] <kiwicoffin> Nomura would have nothing to change if he remade ff8
[5:52:55] <Matrixvingian> VEND O FATE
[5:52:56] <sosandstorm> @BillieNoMates that would have been a trip
[5:52:58] <GilliamYaeger> Time travelling Caim
[5:53:03] <Huntercd> Tifa and Aeris would have ass for months
[5:53:05] <jo_vo> Jesus Nomura, did you have to desecrate the body after butchering it like that?
[5:53:18] <Tikigod784> get rid of Nomura and just put Yoko Taro in an office with a coloring book
[5:53:19] <gensoukaizou> this is it the final battle!
[5:53:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> It isn't 100% nomura
[5:53:22] <Tikigod784> make games based on it
[5:53:22] <sad_toast_> FF 7 Nomura edition
[5:53:24] <gensoukaizou> of midgar..
[5:53:27] <Matrixvingian> The final battle of this part?
[5:53:28] <+Ataerus> the parallels between this and RE3R are staggering, and shows how corrupted by nostalgia games 'journalists' are
[5:53:28] <+EpicureanIguana> If you are annoyed at this nonsense imagine a new player with 0 context going through this LUL
[5:53:31] <majeser> I still think the blitz ball bomb is worse, but this is still pretty bad.
[5:53:37] <Matrixvingian> THE END (Of disc 1)
[5:53:37] <+NukeDaHippies> I don't understand why people are ignoring this crap. it's not simply different, it's incoherent and dull.
[5:53:39] <KaiserMario> Everyone who says it's ok to change and there's no point to a 1:1 to remake, are completely missing the point as to why this whole thing sucks now... Oh just you wait for part 2... boy
[5:53:40] <gazdropish> i mean, if your main themes are going to be that bullshit, shouldn't some characters, or plot points, or even the setting reflect that?
[5:53:56] <ovan20> LUL

[5:54:39] <ovan20> this sound like a theme park ride LUL
[5:54:41] <kiwicoffin> The vending machine has a copy of the original FF7 but it's stuck in the springs

[5:55:17] <+LemanRusk> Everything this game says sounds like the start of a Soul Calibur fight
[5:55:19] <jo_vo> The closer you stand to light, the bigger the shadows grow
[5:55:21] <BlackSunBlood> I dunno...
[5:55:22] <arkv01> yes, we must merge into one amorphous blob to surviev this...
[5:55:29] <BlackSunBlood> MURICA

[5:57:15] <+NukeDaHippies> They're using both aerith and sephiroth
[5:57:19] <arkv01> tifa, destiny lives in your honkers
[5:57:20] <BlackSunBlood> -- random 1 liner ---
[5:57:21] <Eger007> thay don't know shit
[5:57:21] <Trinity5> this is like one step aside from "destiny is destiny"
[5:57:21] <sosandstorm> Barrett save us!
[5:57:23] <examplez0> By "they" you just mean Nomura right?
[5:57:30] <noremac0uo> aerith is clearly a xehanort
[5:57:32] <Matrixvingian> Whoever this asshole is he made a big hole. We better help her out!
[5:57:36] <MilkingEdge> DESTINY IS NOMURA
[5:57:38] <kingra> Destiny is Destiny

[5:58:32] <Sunstalker> Would Jessie lust after Zach too? vadeHm
[5:58:38] <Hydrapissed> we are da MARLNE
[5:58:47] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Not going to lie, I half expected the door to close when Barret was talking
[5:58:50] <Trinity5> give it a second plague
[5:58:52] <@Nightbot> @Krimxon -> Too easy. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[5:58:53] <Monstergelo> Cloud would be cucked by Zack next game
[5:58:56] <smugfox95> oh god its so strange and terrifying
[5:58:57] <+KawaiiJetty> It's ok, ff7 doesn't have a glorious story anyway

[5:59:12] <Trinity5> HERE WE GO

[5:59:17] <+PleasantLee> pretty sure you are in the place where the langoleers go
[5:59:17] <noremac0uo> why would barrett risk his life and potentially leave Marlene with no one to "change destiny"
[5:59:20] <Eger007> look at this destiny monster, which is totaly not heartless
[5:59:22] <arkv01> behold, KINGDOM HEAAAARTS

[5:59:59] <BillieNoMates> At least they have a reason to go to Neo Midgar now
[6:00:00] <Trinity5> cloud can do everything in this next cutscene but he gets stopped by a door
[6:00:02] <Krimxon> I'd be happier if it was a sharknado instead
[6:00:04] <+NukeDaHippies> Yea, but somehow people are calling the haters for this bad writing butthurt purists
[6:00:05] <arkv01> whole party's like OH SHIT WE DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR TORNADO JO BUDDIES ON CRAIGSLIST

[6:00:19] <Daskolin> Time to defeat Mickey Mouse
[6:00:22] <Dementedpenguin> I wonder what the va actors were thinking at this part.
[6:00:24] <Hydrapissed> id rather be at the lab at this point
[6:00:25] <Hydrapissed> honestly
[6:00:25] <sad_toast_> weeeeeeeeeeeee

[6:01:11] <ovan20> isn't this the entire game? confusion? LUL
[6:01:11] <GilliamYaeger> It's Darkside from Kingdom Hearts!
[6:01:17] <Tikigod784> Got places to go gotta
[6:01:23] <Trinity5> confusion is conflated with depth
[6:01:24] <availablethor> That's fitting because Sephiroth is basically Aizen at this point.
[6:01:25] <Tikigod784> "kill off my fanbase"
[6:01:26] <gnollAUS> Just re-bar though the chest and your dead
[6:01:27] <Matrixvingian> Holy shit that's a heartless?
[6:01:29] <arkv01> ITS YA BOI, timegod
[6:01:30] <Krimxon> Yup, Nomura confuses confusion with depth
[6:01:30] <Trinity5> YESE
[6:01:31] <gunsrlove> That is a problem with a lot of Japanese Media
[6:01:32] <waifoong98> basically LUL

[6:01:35] <Eger007> hell yeah a destiny monster
[6:01:37] <Eger007> hell yes
[6:01:39] <KaiserMario> I'm sure it makes sense in his head
[6:01:41] <penitentpentwitch> Enjoy fighting Time Weapon
[6:01:43] <arkv01> oh fuck its LAVOS
[6:01:44] <waifoong98> btw don't die lol

[6:01:51] <Sunstalker> the Dahaka PogChamp
[6:01:53] <Krimxon> STOP WRITING THE FUTURE PLAGUE!
[6:01:55] <Matrixvingian> Where's Kamen Rider when you need him?
[6:01:56] <Tikigod784> The Darkness within Plague's Heart
[6:01:57] <+NukeDaHippies> Not enough people call him out for it......Thats why he'll never learn
[6:01:58] <arkv01> this was the chrono trigger all along!
[6:01:58] <sad_toast_> fighting Destiny itself
[6:02:00] <Dementedpenguin> Stop lying, you wrote this remake.
[6:02:01] <Hydrapissed> that is so a heartless
[6:02:02] <Apolonm> atpCap atpCap
[6:02:03] <sosandstorm> fuck what a good design to waste on a fucking meta narrative device
[6:02:03] <shevan123> eeeyup
[6:02:06] <Trinity5> it even moves like darkside lol
[6:02:10] <Tikigod784> The funny part is that Square Enix is only good at Human-sized bosses
[6:02:11] <Matrixvingian> What in the waste of development dollars is this?
[6:02:12] <+PleasantLee> it might aswell have the heartless symbol
[6:02:13] <MilkingEdge> THIS JUST WENT FULL NOMURA, NEVER GO FULL NOMURA
[6:02:13] <hellfirejefe> isn't this game supposed to be like the first 10% of the original why is there a god monster
[6:02:15] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i fell asleep during the whole motorcycle segment
[6:02:15] <Hydrapissed> YEP
[6:02:16] <+NukeDaHippies> Yes
[6:02:17] <GilliamYaeger> yes

[6:02:21] <Coffee_JD> yup
[6:02:22] <OmegaChev4> he is using confusion to create interest in future title to see how it plays out. lmao KH has zero enemy like that
[6:02:23] <Kyni> much worse
[6:02:24] <+KawaiiJetty> Oh welp
[6:02:25] <DaiRyuseii> Remember when cloud couldn't slice through a safe door earlier?
[6:02:26] <arkv01> we're at the half erect point, yes
[6:02:26] <waifoong98> It's gonna turn super advent children even
[6:02:26] <$doomp12> this is the sonic generations final boss
[6:02:28] <%caramello_man> NotLikeThis
[6:02:31] <+EpicureanIguana> oh you know it LUL
[6:02:34] <availablethor> So can someone tell me why SE lets Nomura do this?
[6:02:34] <Huntercd> why?
[6:02:34] <+PleasantLee> remember when cloud couldnt cut through a pipe lid earlier in hojos lab?
[6:02:35] <%Dalthine> I'm relaying this secondhand, but supposedly Nomura said in an interview that the most important thing in a script is to surprise people.
[6:02:37] <majeser> didn't plague call.this yesterday? cloud flying through the air?
[6:02:38] <Hydrapissed> plague u can sleep now ya dont gata do this
[6:02:42] <EcoFreak07> It's Darkside from the beginning of KH1... it even moves the same. Lol
[6:02:44] <arkv01> slidy widy!
[6:02:44] <Tikigod784> Cloud cuts the train in half later
[6:02:47] <Sokumotanaka> @DaiRyuseii Or a wife fence
[6:02:49] <noremac0uo> really seemed like Nomura wanted to make ff7 into his series, his idea and his work here.
[6:02:50] <mrgaster8> take a deep breath boys
[6:02:51] <Tikigod784> S A D
[6:02:55] <BillieNoMates> this is dumber than just letting us fight Sephiroth
[6:02:55] <sad_toast_> (Kingdom Hearts Noises) 💔
[6:02:56] <examplez0> You haven't even seen the Advent Children part yet
[6:03:08] <GilliamYaeger> I hope you didn't like Barret because this is the last time you're going to use him in the game
[6:03:10] <+Ataerus> lmao!
[6:03:13] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[6:03:13] <Matrixvingian> Arbiter? We FF12 naow?
[6:03:17] <+NukeDaHippies> If the new stuff was interesting and not dumb, i'd be fine with something new
[6:03:17] <Trinity5> tifa "I've trained for this"
[6:03:17] <+EpicureanIguana> should have turned the console off after beating motor ball LUL
[6:03:23] <Eger007> you don't know what arbiter of fate looks like
[6:03:26] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[6:03:27] <Krimxon> I knew Max would go one way and Plague the complete other LUL
[6:03:31] <BillieNoMates> The ELemental Jannies
[6:03:31] <+Kaask> fists, guns, sword, who could these be
[6:03:32] <+Slaardacity> watching both you and Max go through all this and having vastly different takes on this is pretty amusing
[6:03:33] <waifoong98> assess them lol, it's real dumb
[6:03:33] <Tikigod784> fight the same boss 4 times
[6:03:36] <+NukeDaHippies> Watch out! It's a thing!
[6:03:37] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Apparently these are representation of yourself in the OG timeline?
[6:03:37] <ovan20> @PlagueOfGripes fighing to prevent the original game from happening, maybe? LUL
[6:03:38] <+jiggy_snipe> Final Fantasy 13 and Chrono Cross
[6:03:38] <smugfox95> once fate is dead nomura can be free to shit all over the rest of FF7
[6:03:40] <kingra> CORNEO KILLS THE PARTY

[6:04:22] <+NukeDaHippies> I thought they were just uninspired enemies
[6:04:24] <Ophiuchas> yellow= whisper Barret
[6:04:25] <Tikigod784> ARE YOU A GIRL OR A BOY?
[6:04:25] <+jiggy_snipe> these whispers are intersting they fight with a sword, gun, and fists, hmmmmmm
[6:04:27] <TheWe4pon> asses is on aeriths guys
[6:04:32] <hellfirejefe> this feels like the biggest unnecessary nut bust
[6:04:38] <gunsrlove> Necrontyr are gone, and the C'tan are even like this
[6:04:53] <kiwicoffin> Their names are their colors but after digging deep into a thesaurus
[6:04:56] <Krimxon> you can still view the info though
[6:04:56] <gunsrlove> Also Cat 13 is just
[6:04:58] <Krimxon> with touchpad
[6:05:02] <+NukeDaHippies> It's the BIGGEST nut burst. years premature
[6:05:02] <Whyverns> he just named them fancy names for colors
[6:05:05] <arkv01> if only this was the C'tan
[6:05:06] <gunsrlove> not in the party? or ? Like just being there
[6:05:16] <Trinity5> he's not there rn
[6:05:19] <sad_toast_> the have similar weapons to your characters 🤔
[6:05:19] <Trinity5> he's with aerith
[6:05:21] <Hydrapissed> Correction
[6:05:22] <Trinity5> in big fuck off land
[6:05:35] <arkv01> red ghost, blue ghost, yellow ghost
[6:05:44] <+PleasantLee> one of the Arbiter of Fates attacks should be called "umm actually!"
[6:05:48] <Trinity5> yeah lol
[6:05:48] <Matrixvingian> So there's going to be 5 meta bosses in addition to the original ones?
[6:05:49] <gunsrlove> Gun ghost, sword ghost....uh..arm ghost?
[6:05:50] <Hydrapissed> lol yah
[6:05:52] <kiwicoffin> And no follow up
[6:05:53] <+NukeDaHippies> Yea, i face palmed so hard
[6:05:56] <Hydrapissed> in a horrible tragic scene to
[6:05:58] <Trinity5> dude every streamer i saw was so confused lmfao
[6:05:59] <Hydrapissed> and then cute animal
[6:06:02] <+Gigagoat> reminds me of the ff13-2 end boss, but ghosts instead of dragons
[6:06:04] <+PleasantLee> *cat panicing in irish*
[6:06:06] <+Slaardacity> yeah that was weird
[6:06:06] <Trinity5> that shit got me super hard
[6:06:10] <Sokumotanaka> He's the final boss silly
[6:06:12] <+jiggy_snipe> lol if you didn't play the original, that meant nothing to you
[6:06:12] <+NukeDaHippies> Angry Joe saw it and was like WTF WAS THAT!?
[6:06:15] <seth45er> why does it have to be so big?
[6:06:16] <gensoukaizou> remember roche?
[6:06:23] <kingra> No
[6:06:23] <waifoong98> @gensoukaizou who
[6:06:25] <KaiserMario> Remeber when FF7 original plot acyually mattered?
[6:06:26] <noremac0uo> someone needs to rip the game and see how many individual grunt sounds there are, Cloud_Grunt62.mp3
[6:06:26] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> That moment there was apparently showing the characters and their counterparts
[6:06:35] <Krimxon> i would've rather have more time with Roche than this end
[6:06:36] <+Slaardacity> do we not like Roche here?
[6:06:45] <Trinity5> i love roche
[6:06:45] <arkv01> I'm watching on SD resolution and I keep reading it as Whisper Rectum
[6:06:49] <Trinity5> he's so fucking stupid
[6:06:50] <waifoong98> @Slaardacity discount Majima is discount Majima
[6:06:52] <Huntercd> If Reeve knew about the plate falling, why didn't he warn people?
[6:06:56] <+jiggy_snipe> if you did, then you can surmise the Reeve was trying to help or something
[6:07:00] <+justianxix> I like roche, but I know he is stupid
[6:07:19] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Roche could be a decent majima spinoff. Maybe
[6:07:21] <bluefooddye1> Roche is dumb, but he's the fun kind of dumb
[6:07:21] <gunsrlove> Whisper NinkomidirinondidrakhiblandiBlardGlar
[6:07:24] <+Gigagoat> Roche was fightsexual
[6:07:24] <+justianxix> He's just Motorcycle Dante
[6:07:27] <Hydrapissed> if we get him working
[6:07:28] <hellfirejefe> video games were a mistake
[6:07:29] <KaiserMario> LUL
[6:07:30] <TheWe4pon> man, all this shit is making me depressed.
[6:07:36] <+KawaiiJetty> I'm ok with Roche, he is too horny for Cloud though
[6:07:36] <Krimxon> Roche is fine imo, he perpetuates the "SOLDIER are crazy unstable oddballs"
[6:07:42] <Matrixvingian> Plague's going full Lucas Plinkett on this.
[6:07:43] <KaiserMario> SHUT UP GEORGE
[6:07:47] <kiwicoffin> Look at all these squares
[6:07:51] <gazdropish> @thewe4pon same
[6:07:55] <+PleasantLee> solve all problems with gun, even your predetermined destiny
[6:08:01] <+PleasantLee> and rocks
[6:08:13] <gunsrlove> Lol, never gonna happen
[6:08:17] <+Gigagoat> Just shot destiny
[6:08:18] <seth45er> ass sliding on asphalt
[6:08:18] <Sokumotanaka> they're gonna let him
[6:08:23] <Matrixvingian> SHAMFUR DISPRAY
[6:08:23] <waifoong98> they asked him to be the lead lol
[6:08:25] <Eger007> future timeline
[6:08:25] <gunsrlove> They love these tho
[6:08:26] <arkv01> pay the gooch whatever you must to come back, HE WON'T
[6:08:26] <+EpicureanIguana> too late 2nd game is already in production
[6:08:30] <penitentpentwitch> Give game 2 to Yoko Taro
[6:08:31] <+PleasantLee> the idea of nomura being intimidating in an office is weird
[6:08:36] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> nomura brings in the phat money stacks man
[6:08:36] <MilkingEdge> COMMIT SUDOKU
[6:08:39] <+PleasantLee> hes way too jpop for htat
[6:08:42] <KaiserMario> Oh, you KNOW he's already working on the second one!
[6:08:43] <BillieNoMates> this has already out sold FF13 and 15. It's not going to get him canceled
[6:08:56] <+PleasantLee> rebrum! rebrum!
[6:09:01] <sad_toast_> did you analysis the BiG Demon thing too?
[6:09:01] <Sokumotanaka> @penitentpentwitch He's not any better with his story telling
[6:09:01] <arkv01> episode 2 with 300% more musicals
[6:09:04] <Huntercd> So are the time ghosts going to stop them from meeting Vincent and Yuffie?
[6:09:19] <+NukeDaHippies> People excited to see what happens next, have never played Kingdom Hearts and payed attention
[6:09:21] <Tikigod784> the young fanbase that eats all of Nomura's shit up are fine with being abused with bad content. Why do you think the Kingdom Hearts Mobile game is a moneymaker?
[6:09:22] <waifoong98> @Huntercd eh, you will see
[6:09:23] <kingra> @PlagueOfGripes They let THREE Lightning games exist. Do you think they care?
[6:09:25] <Hydrapissed> we staggerd FATE
[6:09:25] <arkv01> the time ghosts are already unbuttoning yuffie, she'll be fine
[6:09:28] <Hydrapissed> kk combo FATE
[6:09:33] <arkv01> they might have to kill vincent off cause of dirge of cerberus
[6:09:39] <penitentpentwitch> @Sokumotanaka This is true, but if it's already off the rails might as well go full throttle
[6:09:43] <+PleasantLee> owie my Hand of Fate!
[6:09:43] <+jiggy_snipe> I mean Nomura gets too much blame. Nojima is the writer (look at his credits) and Toriyama is co-director and (look at his credit). People should spread the blame
[6:09:45] <Krimxon> this guy isn't even the worst part
[6:09:45] <gunsrlove> HELP ME GOOFY
[6:09:46] <Sokumotanaka> @BillieNoMates Outselling 13 isn't a feat but 15? yeah
[6:09:47] <+KawaiiJetty> The team let him do it, this is also selling like hotcakes so i don't think Nomura is going lol
[6:09:48] <GilliamYaeger> Say goodbye to Barret
[6:09:52] <MilkingEdge> FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC
[6:09:54] <GilliamYaeger> You're not going to play him again ever
[6:09:58] <+PleasantLee> bad end?!?!?!
[6:10:00] <sad_toast_> OOOWWWCHHHIIIEEEE
[6:10:03] <Coffee_JD> I clapped when I saw it
[6:10:09] <waifoong98> clap clap clpa
[6:10:12] <+KawaiiJetty> Advent Children lol
[6:10:15] <arkv01> red 13 FUCKS
[6:10:17] <+justianxix> Great. I hate it
[6:10:22] <TheWe4pon> remember when they restarted development cause they didn't like how it was coming out? I bet it was better than this shit
[6:10:22] <+OnTheDonner> We have to stop that from happening!! Cause..
[6:10:23] <+NukeDaHippies> Did you guys know......that ff7 was the bad route all along??
[6:10:24] <kingra> TIME TRAVEL
[6:10:26] <Sergiroth> No children allowed.
[6:10:29] <Whyverns> WE CANT ALLOW RED 13 TO BE HAPPY
[6:10:29] <+jiggy_snipe> that was the last scene from FF7 OG
[6:10:30] <Hydrapissed> okay so the OG ff7 cant happen now?
[6:10:31] <+PleasantLee> red must be happy hes gonna get to fuck
[6:10:36] <arkv01> red must not be allowed to fuck!
[6:10:38] <Huntercd> Two kids
[6:10:47] <Dementedpenguin> Is this game gonna end with Cloud being teleported to Tactics? NotLikeThis
[6:10:47] <sad_toast_> darkness darkness light fat destiny hearts darkness darkness
[6:10:51] <waifoong98> they want you to watch all the materials even
[6:10:53] <shevan123> yeah its nothing
[6:10:53] <Eger007> why?
[6:10:56] <penitentpentwitch> The dread fate... of parenthood!
[6:10:58] <waifoong98> "for newcomers" my ass
[6:11:00] <+justianxix> Imagine all the shitposting now that the OG game and the ending is now the "Bad End" GOD
[6:11:01] <Monstergelo> red just doesn't want kids
[6:11:02] <Sokumotanaka> we dont really see the kids it's way to blurry
[6:11:02] <Whyverns> WE CANT ALLOW RED TO FUCK WHITE GIRLS
[6:11:04] <arkv01> @Dementedpenguin holy fuck I totally forgot about that LUL
[6:11:20] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> This is why I wish this came with a FFVII remaster. FFVIIR is a companion piece/alt story
[6:11:25] <+Gigagoat> why do they even care, they met Red like, 2 hours ago
[6:11:27] <+NukeDaHippies> Yea, I played this as if i were a newcomer, and theres so much pandering to fans, it's confusing
[6:11:30] <Ophiuchas> all I've midgar exploding? 🤔
[6:11:33] <kingra> WATCH DREAM DROP TO UNDERSTAND 2
[6:11:33] <sad_toast_> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[6:11:33] <Coffee_JD> KH fans love this crap
[6:11:34] <Krimxon> @PlagueOfGripes I feel that constantly
[6:11:36] <GilliamYaeger> Max sucked the dick of this ending something fierce
[6:11:39] <penitentpentwitch> You are living in a world of crazy people
[6:11:41] <Eger007> It got positive feedback on metacritic
[6:11:42] <majeser> what if the old ending was actually bad?
[6:11:43] <Huntercd> Plus, Aeris looks at Red so it kinda implies She and Red fucked
[6:11:43] <noremac0uo> furry boi must not reproduce, guess we'll take him to the vet tomorrow
[6:11:44] <Basteksamplastek> Clown World
[6:11:45] <waifoong98> the world is full of crazies
[6:11:48] <+jiggy_snipe> Plague, people don't. You are way critical than most people
[6:11:50] <Dementedpenguin> @arkv01 With all this teleporting nonsense, it's the first thing that came to mind. LUL
[6:11:51] <Djinnazz> Meh, I'm fine with it. I want to see how it play out..
[6:11:51] <Sir__Nova> You're not the only one Plague
[6:11:53] <bluefooddye1> We musn't let the good story come to pass, we have to make the nomuraverse prevail
[6:11:54] <gazdropish> @plagueofgripes they don't. people love it
[6:11:56] <Eger007> it got overall positive reception
[6:11:56] <Whyverns> JUST EAT DA POPO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
[6:11:56] <shevan123> im a fan of kh and this shit is BAD
[6:11:57] <sad_toast_> let it out gripes I feel yuh
[6:11:58] <Hydrapissed> plague u need to wake up plague
[6:12:00] <Ekaelis> Stop ruining people enjoyment Plague LUL
[6:12:01] <hellfirejefe> this is so detached from everything they could've added new stuff without going completely off the deep end
[6:12:02] <gunsrlove> It's just teenagers getting hype at dumb anime things don't worry about it
[6:12:02] <Trinity5> isn't that how a lot of people view critical people
[6:12:04] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> about 66% of ppl like the ending i would say
[6:12:06] <Hydrapissed> plague wake up COME BACK to us plague
[6:12:07] <+NukeDaHippies> @PlagueOfGripes I've been getting alota crap for my feeling on this game so far
[6:12:07] <Krimxon> CONSOOM PRODUCT THOUGH
[6:12:09] <+PleasantLee> we respect you, Eli. you arent alone
[6:12:09] <KattenBertil> "Just go play the original"
[6:12:10] <Eger007> they don't
[6:12:11] <Trinity5> i mean it don't
[6:12:14] <DaiRyuseii> this world is crazy for thinking this game is good, this is shit.
[6:12:15] <waifoong98> LUL
[6:12:15] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes i literally have friends who tell me to stop bringing it up its great
[6:12:17] <MilkingEdge> YOU MUST EMBRACE THE NOMURA PLAGUE
[6:12:17] <ovan20> @PlagueOfGripes nah, this game will receive praises because pretty visuals
[6:12:18] <examplez0> DON'T ASK QUESTIONS JUST CONSUME PRODUCT THEN GET HYPED FOR NEXT PRODUCT
[6:12:18] <Daskolin> People are more stupid than coes
[6:12:19] <Hydrapissed> he luved it
[6:12:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> You are just gwumpy wumpy
[6:12:26] <seth45er> me too! so is this what like when doves cry?
[6:12:29] <+EpicureanIguana> 'hurr durr you are afraid of change, different is good u mad' is what is basically boils down to
[6:12:30] <KaiserMario> Shut up, don't ask questions, consume product, then anticipate next product
[6:12:34] <+Kiiper> He cried in joy
[6:12:35] <+NukeDaHippies> HE WAS. Blind fanboy. But thats in his character
[6:12:36] <Hydrapissed> yep thats right
[6:12:37] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Max is hype for the unknown
[6:12:39] <ralphfromdk> Max fucking loved it, and is super exited for the future
[6:12:39] <arkv01> dw plague we're here to help you dispose of nomuras body
[6:12:41] <frostycrinkle> Nah he was slurping this all right up
[6:12:46] <+EpicureanIguana> Max is a goofball, its part of his appeal. Dont pin it on him
[6:12:46] <Trinity5> isn't the metacritic score already out?
[6:12:47] <+spacehouse> Why do Americans not want free healthcare while living in a pandemic?
[6:12:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Max is very hype for the unknown
[6:12:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> Being positive about stuff isn't harmful, the original game is available anywhere
[6:12:51] <waifoong98> he slurp it real hard
[6:12:53] <DaiRyuseii> Oney was right, this game is a true blackpill.
[6:12:54] <GilliamYaeger> Nah, IGN called this Kingdom Hearts crap
[6:12:54] <Krimxon> 87% metacritic
[6:12:55] <Hydrapissed> he had watched a vid on the story after words btw lol
[6:12:56] <+justianxix> IGN didnt surprisely
[6:12:56] <gunsrlove> most people love it....This has 300 viewers , Max at the end had 30K , and they weren't very negative
[6:12:57] <Verdenfert> man, all i've seen just makes me want to try the original FF7
[6:12:57] <SnickSnack666> This ending opens so many plot holes in the story
[6:12:58] <%LordSDB> Max has been doing theory talk for about a hour now
[6:12:59] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> assuming any game outlets are even finishing it
[6:12:59] <Apolonm> yes Max was happy
[6:13:06] <kingra> Oh boy time for THIRD BIRTHDAY
[6:13:08] <+KawaiiJetty> Let some time pass
[6:13:08] <Ekaelis> Plague is to FF7 Remake what Mauler is to Disney Star Wars
[6:13:08] <law240> except for you our hero
[6:13:09] <+capykami> Why do people give 2 shits about what a paid shill kike Max has to say?
[6:13:13] <availablethor> @fillmydarksoulwithlight That.
[6:13:19] <ralphfromdk> Look at it this way. This is a chance to experience the same feeling of a new game all over again, instead of just playing the same game 23 years later.
[6:13:19] <noremac0uo> what the hell, now I love IGN
[6:13:21] <+PleasantLee> jeez plague stop plaining all the time gawd
[6:13:26] <kiwicoffin> I think this game proves your favorite characters are just pieces to placed and removed to manipulate you
[6:13:26] <+AnthraxJohnson> Nomura could fire out a massive log onto Max’s chest and he’d still tear up and thank him
[6:13:28] <+Kaask> nomuras crazy, this shits crazy. yet, im invested. i want to see what happens next, and how they continue to adapt the rest of the game. its just a shame it's so kingdom hearts, and i like kingdom hearts.
[6:13:30] <MilkingEdge> EVERYONE SUCKING ON THAT NOMURA DICK HARD
[6:13:30] <%LordSDB> Also I think the general feeling for this game has be a 8 outta 10 plague
[6:13:41] <DaiRyuseii> the people who like it are wrong honestly.
[6:13:42] <+PleasantLee> umm actually
[6:13:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> I like Nomura's works
[6:13:46] <GilliamYaeger> @ralphfromdk I'd rather not play a new Nomura game, they are universally bad
[6:13:50] <sad_toast_> Tiffa "aite I'ma head out"
[6:13:58] <+UnwoundCaesar70> "ACTUALLY"
[6:13:59] <GilliamYaeger> Advent Children was awful and so is this ending
[6:14:02] <arkv01> tifa's done with this bullshit
[6:14:03] <GilliamYaeger> In much the same way
[6:14:03] <gazdropish> @conlin_arts_ why
[6:14:04] <Trinity5> yeah game is an 7/10 imo but i'm enjoying playing it a lot
[6:14:05] <arkv01> she's got a bar to rebuild
[6:14:06] <Hydrapissed> also getting a little heavy handed on the fan thing nomrua
[6:14:07] <SnickSnack666> Combat wise I like this game but there is so much wrong with this game
[6:14:10] <+ConLin_Arts_> I just like it!
[6:14:12] <FrostedZaibatsu> Nomura didnt write this soo.. tf are yall going on about
[6:14:15] <Sokumotanaka> @capykami That's kinda unfair dude. Just cause he likes it doesn't mean he;s a paid shill he just likes it let's not toss insults at a person who didn't earn them.
[6:14:17] <peterthepanda115> Cmon, admit you're the complaining guy, it's literally your channels name
[6:14:22] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> See, if they did a FFVII remaster, with the original, but in 1080P and attached it to this, I feel like FFVIIR make a lot more sense.
[6:14:25] <+NukeDaHippies> @PlagueOfGripes I'm just glad to hear someone was having my exact through process going through this. It at least puts me at ease that i'm not simply over thinking things
[6:14:27] <Krimxon> @capykami I think that's highly reductive, Max isn't paid or he would have to state so. He is however a positive guy and a huge fanboy
[6:14:32] <Medo3G> it should've been called retcon
[6:14:38] <GilliamYaeger> @FrostedZaibatsu Nomura is the director and he's gone on record as saying he has DIRECTLY written the scripts of every KH game since 2.
[6:14:39] <noremac0uo> so wait, who wrote this?
[6:14:42] <sad_toast_> (adjusts Fedora) let me tell you how it really is
[6:14:44] <gazdropish> @conlin_arts_ what do you like about them
[6:14:48] <arkv01> max isn't a paid shill, he's genuinely shilling from the heart
[6:14:51] <KaiserMario> It's fucked up, because the game itself is good, but it shits on the original while jerking off the fans at same time...
[6:14:57] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes its canon that FF7 cloud from the future nail batted the grenade back at jessie to kill her.
[6:15:04] <+PleasantLee> just keep swinging
[6:15:04] <BillieNoMates> Hit the sttaggered enemy
[6:15:09] <GilliamYaeger> Hit the dead whisper
[6:15:10] <Hydrapissed> hit stunned guy
[6:15:18] <+capykami> Max was literally invited to Square events. Paying streamers this big to advertise their games is common practice.
[6:15:35] <DaiRyuseii> @nukedahippies you should check Oney out, he's a major ff6 fan who hates the remake too.
[6:15:37] <+Gigagoat> I hate it when the camera pulls away during gameplay, feels bad
[6:15:39] <FrostedZaibatsu> @GilliamYaeger what does KH have to do with this? The original writer for FF7 wrote this. Complain about him and get off of Nomura's dick
[6:15:40] <+ConLin_Arts_> I like the characters, designs, the stories might be all over the place but it has heart, I just like how they are!
[6:15:47] <DaiRyuseii> ff7*
[6:15:48] <sad_toast_> I think every time you kill one of the 3 it just hurts him?
[6:15:49] <Trinity5> @Gigagoat hard agree
[6:15:51] <+PleasantLee> weeeeeee, that looks fun to do
[6:16:02] <Trinity5> if it's gonna be an action game you gotta give me some agency on my actions lol
[6:16:07] <+jiggy_snipe> @GilliamYaeger Nojima is the writer and he's the primary writer for Kingdom Hearts. Spread the blame bro. Give some to Toriyama too cuz he's a co-director
[6:16:14] <arkv01> @capykami I mean it's kinda like how pat got a free early copy, they're not paid to sing it's praises but if they want to be in squenix's good graces for the future
[6:16:18] <SnickSnack666> This entire boss fight on hard was one big cluster fuck
[6:16:18] <+justianxix> Noruma is still the Director, and the game still has the whiff of his dick ALL OVER IT
[6:16:20] <Hydrapissed> wow he reaches that
[6:16:22] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[6:16:23] <+ConLin_Arts_> Like I rather have someone go bonkers with a passion for the project instead of just making stuff like a machine
[6:16:32] <+NukeDaHippies> I've had heated arguments as to why KH3 is one of the worst written stories ever. Yes, someone refutes that claim
[6:16:37] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> maxes hype kinda died before getting to the end, i feel like he knows that hos ability to keep covering events is dependent on criticism and getting people to buy into the series, but thats all pointless speculation at best
[6:16:43] <Trinity5> who the fuck is defending kh story LUL
[6:16:48] <GilliamYaeger> @jiggy_snipe Yeah, that's true. Nomura, Nojima and Toriyama is like a trifecta of shit - the three men responsible for the absolute WORST of Square's output over the last few decades
[6:16:49] <Whyverns> nojima and nomura write the same kind of stupid bullshit
[6:16:50] <Macfine> i wonder if would dislike this more or less than the original. I have almost no reverence for the original, I only played it a few years a go for the first time, in my...30s
[6:16:51] <+Kaask> Nomura doesn't write, per se, but he still had pretty much all creative control over the story.
[6:16:54] <+ConLin_Arts_> I really liked KH3, sure 2FM is better but I still like it!!
[6:16:57] <Daskolin> Max throwing video of DOC BROWN
[6:17:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> I'm just a positive lad that likes what I like!
[6:17:16] <+NukeDaHippies> No, thats the bad ending, we don't want it!
[6:17:18] <Hydrapissed> what lol
[6:17:21] <FrostedZaibatsu> The game is good. Yall just sheep for Plague and cant think for yourself
[6:17:22] <GilliamYaeger> Barret's gone forever now
[6:17:27] <+NukeDaHippies> FF7 was a mistake!
[6:17:28] <GilliamYaeger> goodbye barret
[6:17:32] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[6:17:33] <Whyverns> remember when nojima wrote about tidus cheating on yuna and then blowing up after kicking a mine thinking it was a blitz ball?
[6:17:34] <Trinity5> time for barret and red to fuck off
[6:17:35] <+PleasantLee> no one knows
[6:17:35] <Eger007> now it is
[6:17:36] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> No fate but what we make
[6:17:37] <sosandstorm> bitch
[6:17:38] <Sokumotanaka> HE SAID BITCH
[6:17:40] <waifoong98> literally this fanfic is
[6:17:43] <Macfine> those things look like bayformers
[6:17:46] <+justianxix> Wasn't the OG about Life and Death and dealing with grief
[6:17:53] <shevan123> the greeks did it best
[6:17:53] <Zohare> Why didn't they just change the story? This entire part the story didn't need to exist
[6:17:54] <noremac0uo> please stop with the quips
[6:17:59] <+gothvomit_> i think it’s flawed, but i enjoyed the game quite a bit
[6:17:59] <sad_toast_> yes ,😒
[6:18:01] <+jiggy_snipe> here comes Lightning with: Destiny is destiny Kappa
[6:18:01] <Hydrapissed> lots of faliure in ff7
[6:18:02] <law240> except for the time ghost
[6:18:02] <+PleasantLee> I completed the game and have no clue if the game is about changing the future or preserving it, or why the ghosts are here, or how sephiroth is fucking shit up
[6:18:03] <Sokumotanaka> Why did red go with barret? Are they friends now?
[6:18:05] <Hydrapissed> VOLTRON
[6:18:06] <sosandstorm> OH they look like bionicles!
[6:18:06] <arkv01> is this whole defying fate thing just aeris screaming I DON WANNA DIE FAM
[6:18:09] <GilliamYaeger> GATTAI
[6:18:10] <Trinity5> @gothvomit_ yeah that's where i'm at with it
[6:18:11] <waifoong98> @Zohare to spit on people face
[6:18:18] <smugfox95> Time Janny Bahamut
[6:18:20] <+spacehouse> TRI FUSION WAIFU
[6:18:20] <availablethor> It's about Nomura defying the fan's wishes to remake FF7 instead of rewriting it. The ghosts are the fans.
[6:18:21] <Macfine> wow literally a bayformer
[6:18:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> Is this flawed? Yes, do I hate it? No!
[6:18:23] <kingra> @FrostedZaibatsu It is good. It's just everything with the ghosts that is shit
[6:18:25] <+PleasantLee> use real bahamut on him
[6:18:26] <Trinity5> like there's a lot to hate but there's a lot i ended up liking
[6:18:26] <Medo3G> is this a megazord
[6:18:26] <smugfox95> This game is fuckin stupid
[6:18:27] <Hydrapissed> gata reuse that model
[6:18:28] <BillieNoMates> Bring in your OWN!
[6:18:30] <kiwicoffin> @Zohare this part exists to justify it existing. Very Nomura logic
[6:18:31] <GilliamYaeger> Summon your own Bahamut!
[6:18:33] <sad_toast_> magic dance!
[6:18:34] <Huntercd> They don't know what their fates are yet They can't change what they don't know
[6:18:35] <MilkingEdge> SUMMON BAHAMUT
[6:18:35] <+NukeDaHippies> Heres the thing....If they really wanted to change the story so bad....then just do it.You don't need this dumb plot ghost sub plot
[6:18:37] <@Nightbot> @gunsrlove -> Questionable judgement. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[6:18:38] <+Kaask> I agree that it's a good game. I'm completely fine with an original story, even if it uses the original game as a precursor and setup to tell it. I just don't think it needed to be Kingdom Hearts 4, or that marketing should have lied to us about the game.
[6:18:40] <Hydrapissed> also why bahumut
[6:18:41] <DaiRyuseii> this remake makes fights look so damn tedious
[6:18:43] <Zohare> I guess so
[6:18:47] <+gothvomit_> i kinda wish the whispers were more smoothly integrated into the story
[6:18:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> the original had its stupid moments as well
[6:18:52] <+gothvomit_> they feel a little forced
[6:18:55] <Krimxon> @FrostedZaibatsu Liking something =/= having no complaints, that's just blind consumerism
[6:18:58] <GilliamYaeger> slow motion shot of dragon crotch
[6:18:59] <gazdropish> @conlin_arts_ did you play the original
[6:19:01] <+gothvomit_> not even a little at times
[6:19:04] <kiwicoffin> Plague is expecting real Bahamut damage
[6:19:18] <+EpicureanIguana> Why would anyone play this shit story about time travel and fate defiance when you have stuff like legacy of kain that does it much better and actually makes sense
[6:19:19] <Hydrapissed> she fall down
[6:19:24] <gunsrlove> There is such a thing as too much lights and shiny particles
[6:19:26] <gunsrlove> This is it
[6:19:29] <+ConLin_Arts_> I haven't finished it myself, but it has been part of my youth a lot due to osmosis!
[6:19:34] <Dereh0g> I like the idea of defying fate and shit but the exeqution is bizzare and not very good
[6:19:40] <EcoFreak07> FF7R is like Star Wars Phantom Menace.... if you remove literally everything about Jar Jar and Midiclorians (Time ghosts here).. then its pretty decent.... but those things exist so its just awful.
[6:19:41] <+ConLin_Arts_> my friend played it a bunch and I watched most of it
[6:19:41] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Krimxon i didnt say the game had no faults riooCool
[6:19:44] <kiwicoffin> @EpicureanIguana It bait and switches you the last 2 hours
[6:19:45] <arkv01> dragon fight PogChamp
[6:19:49] <gunsrlove> Doodi calls
[6:19:51] <gazdropish> @conlin_arts_ figured as much
[6:19:56] <Trinity5> one of em has to change
[6:19:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Like I know most of the story and stuff!
[6:19:57] <+justianxix> I am only hating the story so hard because I like every other part of the game and its good. Its just the story turning to shit is SO BAD.
[6:20:08] <arkv01> oh its the same monster model LIL
[6:20:11] <+NukeDaHippies> Whisper bahumat looks like the doller store knockoff
[6:20:15] <+Slaardacity> Max is explaining timelines and looking at back the future clips he's going crazy over snack bags and shit.
[6:20:15] <+Kaask> also if you game over here, you have to redo the entire segment from the beginning. was great to find out.
[6:20:16] <noremac0uo> also remove most of the sephiroth over exposure.
[6:20:18] <+ConLin_Arts_> But I have never gotten motivated to finish it myself
[6:20:19] <MilkingEdge> WHO WORE IT BETTER BAHAMUT OR WHISPER BAHAMUT
[6:20:21] <Krimxon> @FrostedZaibatsu No but you immediately accused anybody with complaints of sucking Plague dick
[6:20:25] <Sokumotanaka> If that's true nomura isn't a bad writer for including the ghost, he;s worse he's a petty asshole cause instead of remastering ff7 he wants to kick and scream cause he didn't get to scrible all over an already established game
[6:20:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> 9 is the only one of the PS1 games that I really got into
[6:20:35] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i think the shittier thing is the time ghots being the original ff7 charecters. it shits on them and makes them look willing to let a lot of people die
[6:20:35] <sad_toast_> looks like one of us will have to DIE
[6:20:39] <Hydrapissed> provoke I guess
[6:20:40] <+NukeDaHippies> But it doesn't work on bosses lol
[6:20:43] <Hydrapissed> idk
[6:20:43] <+Gigagoat> Wish they gave aerith some new voice lines for the final bosses, seems silly :P
[6:20:43] <Macfine> Here's the question though, was the original ever that good, or were you 12 when you played ... Its a good game. But Everyone's favorite final fantasy is the first one they play. And they get worse after that
[6:20:45] <SnickSnack666> Provoke is way to flimsy, half the time it wont work
[6:20:58] <Djinnazz> Provoke doesn't work on bosses.
[6:20:59] <Kyni> good thing the provoke materia doesn't work on bosses^^
[6:21:03] <BillieNoMates> Game telling Eli how to play as well LUL
[6:21:08] <arkv01> tifa whispering the r word she was denied earlier
[6:21:11] <+NukeDaHippies> I appreciated FF7 more as an adult
[6:21:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Krimxon i was talking about the blame on Nomura... want to be wrong some more?
[6:21:28] <+gothvomit_> the big issue for a lot of people seems to be that squenix lied about what the game would be
[6:21:33] <availablethor> The whole game feels like a commentary on its own development. The changes that didn't happen were the changes the Nomura wanted to make, the ghosts are the people who stopped him from doing them. This is him overcoming all that and becoming the lead writer of the story, and saying that now he can do whatever he wants.
[6:21:35] <Krimxon> @FrostedZaibatsu Want to retcon your statement some more?
[6:21:35] <Macfine> I played it for the first time as an adult..it was..ok, but weird,
[6:21:37] <+Slaardacity> @macfine that's not true at all. my first was 7 and my favorite is 9 and 12
[6:21:41] <silvcrest> tthe original not being perfect makes it fine to shit all over it and those who enjoyed
[6:21:51] <+gothvomit_> perhaps my perception is different because i didn’t really keep up with the games rumor mill or hype stuff
[6:21:52] <Macfine> @Slaardacity congrats your the exception to the rule
[6:22:06] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[6:22:10] <+Kaask> 7 is generally the "best" like Ocarina of Time and Mario 64 are the "best." They were the first real 3D games in their series and revolutionized the series as a whole. It's what makes them so memorable. FF7 was good though, and it offered a huge wealth of content and silly side stuff to do, that no future entry actually competes with.
[6:22:13] <gunsrlove> Whisper Mickey get in there
[6:22:15] <FrostedZaibatsu> @Krimxon Person of the internet. Leave me alone
[6:22:15] <+NukeDaHippies> You thought this boring fight was over?
[6:22:30] <+jiggy_snipe> i will say that one of the benefits of FF7R is that it doesn't attempt make original obsoletete. Most remakes make their OGs sorta obsolete (Twin Snakes, FF4, FF3, RE Remake, etc.)
[6:22:32] <Krimxon> @FrostedZaibatsu GG, bow out and begone
[6:22:32] <+Slaardacity> @macfine I highly doubtful I'm the only one how feels that way but ok
[6:22:33] <BillieNoMates> I was hoping Nomura was going to pull a Stick of Truth moment and summons would counter each other
[6:22:38] <Huntercd> @availablethor I can see that and that might be right
[6:22:39] <Medo3G> dude they are literally dahakas
[6:22:39] <BillieNoMates> but nope
[6:22:41] <Dementedpenguin> Don't jinx it.
[6:22:44] <Hydrapissed> oo0o0 jesus idk kinda interested on how stupid that would get
[6:22:46] <waifoong98> good god pls no
[6:22:49] <shevan123> but why
[6:22:50] <Trinity5> okay but unironically that sounds kinda amazing
[6:22:52] <+justianxix> Well OoT has time travel, so it would make sense there
[6:22:54] <ditrak> stfu dude
[6:22:55] <hellfirejefe> if people who played the original don't like the changes and people who haven't won't understand what's happening then who is this for?
[6:22:57] <+JamesCorck> You haven't replayed Mario 64 lately, have ya? XD
[6:22:59] <+jiggy_snipe> sure why not lol
[6:23:03] <+ConLin_Arts_> I see this more as a companion game to the original, the original is out on everything and is super cheap
[6:23:04] <Macfine> @Slaardacity you don't have to be the only one, but in most cases, from my experiences its very True, hell I played 6 first its my fav.
[6:23:10] <Tikigod784> this is for the FANFIC WRITERS
[6:23:12] <+NukeDaHippies> So this remake doesn't have the same story or gameplay
[6:23:12] <+jiggy_snipe> im always down for nonsense
[6:23:15] <KaiserMario> @Macfine I only played the original way later and have no love for lt, it's simple, sure, but this feels like Nomura jerking off... It insults my intelligence that he'd think this is good...
[6:23:16] <Sokumotanaka> You might savea da planet mario!
[6:23:18] <Tikigod784> Nomura wanted to show off his fanfic
[6:23:24] <Tikigod784> and abused company dollars for it
[6:23:35] <+gothvomit_> i dislike making the argument of “just play the original” but honestly i don’t find the idea of a 1:1 remake very interesting
[6:23:41] <+gothvomit_> but maybe i just have brain worms
[6:23:43] <Macfine> @KaiserMario is it worse fanfic than FF4 the after years though?
[6:24:02] <law240> AC
[6:24:03] <+NukeDaHippies> That actually doesn't happen. Sephiroth didn't have his shirt off
[6:24:06] <+PleasantLee> that was the from the start of the advent children movie that recaps the game
[6:24:06] <Whyverns> the omnislash at the end of the game
[6:24:07] <KattenBertil> Advent children
[6:24:07] <gunsrlove> LUL
[6:24:13] <+justianxix> I see people that want to see something different from FF7 or want to change shit like Aerith's death be more receptive of the ending
[6:24:14] <Hydrapissed> no way thats advent lol
[6:24:15] <+KawaiiJetty> I prefer XII with the whole Defy Fate/Gods" whatever
[6:24:16] <law240> it's the very beginning of AC
[6:24:17] <gunsrlove> "We did it! K. "
[6:24:18] <sad_toast_> pew pew pew
[6:24:21] <BillieNoMates> Sephiroth was bare chested in the final omnislash
[6:24:22] <availablethor> It didn't have to be an 1:1 remake but the execution of this final battle is atrocious.
[6:24:24] <noremac0uo> this is the marketable ff7 square always wanted.
[6:24:24] <Monstergelo> well thats easy
[6:24:26] <Huntercd> AC
[6:24:27] <wsazasz> They just imported footage from Advent Children
[6:24:28] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes this game is a sequal to AC
[6:24:34] <hellfirejefe> I was really liking what they added until the plot ghosts became the star of the show
[6:24:38] <Sokumotanaka> That's from advent childrend and I can't believe they're just using old ass footage as a placeholder
[6:24:40] <waifoong98> also this FF12 song
[6:24:44] <KaiserMario> @Macfine irrelevant, this is shitty fanfic, it shouldn't be like this. It's like he thinks he's too smart for the original...
[6:24:46] <waifoong98> sounds really ff12
[6:25:01] <+Slaardacity> I feel the same @gothvomit_ I'm fine with things being different
[6:25:07] <Macfine> @KaiserMario I'm just asking because the after years was shitty fanfic, but i still enjoyed it overall
[6:25:07] <sosandstorm> dw that wasn't important
[6:25:11] <arkv01> where's this sequel to AC stuff coming from?
[6:25:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> But yeah what I'm most interested in is where this will lead!
[6:25:15] <+gothvomit_> yeah idk
[6:25:28] <+gothvomit_> if anything i think the scale of this game is my largest issue
[6:25:28] <+PleasantLee> "I'LL SHOOT IT AGAIN!"
[6:25:31] <Sokumotanaka> What is red doing?
[6:25:32] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I dont mind changes, but this is just nomura jacking off that he can make changes. Its meaningless
[6:25:32] <Djinnazz> BUffing
[6:25:32] <BillieNoMates> his limit breajk
[6:25:32] <Hydrapissed> hes limit I guess
[6:25:33] <snowmanse> moral support
[6:25:34] <+gothvomit_> it feels insanely linear
[6:25:34] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> FFVIIR is just a soft reboot of FFVII, it's acknowledging the original and it's events and trying to do something different while re-treading the events of the early game
[6:25:37] <Macfine> Red is being a cameo
[6:25:37] <law240> his limit break
[6:25:37] <Whyverns> GACKT IS GOING TO COME BACK AND YOU WILL LIKE IT
[6:25:37] <waifoong98> "emotional support"
[6:25:37] <+Gigagoat> his best
[6:25:43] <+jiggy_snipe> he's using his limit break "Stardust Ray"
[6:25:43] <noremac0uo> get hype for final hearts iii guys
[6:25:43] <smugfox95> Hes the mascot, hes just there for moral support
[6:25:43] <availablethor> This is nothing yet.
[6:25:44] <Ophiuchas> it's official aeris ain't dying
[6:25:44] <Krimxon> the sequel stuff is from these enemies being Tifa, Cloud and Barret from the future somehow
[6:25:44] <Tikigod784> "I'll never be just a memory" @arkv01
[6:25:46] <sosandstorm> Barrett has such a good supporting cast for his game
[6:25:47] <frostycrinkle> I think he's fire augmenting Barret's gun or something, I dunno
[6:25:49] <gunsrlove> Final boss: 14 GACKTS
[6:25:56] <+PleasantLee> just shoot it with aeris
[6:25:57] <shevan123> yes
[6:25:57] <+NukeDaHippies> It's so boring
[6:25:58] <Trinity5> yeah it's not great
[6:26:00] <Hydrapissed> oh yah its nothing
[6:26:02] <KaiserMario> @Macfine It's not like this game isn't enjoyable, but as I said before, it feels insulting to me, so I just get pissed at it
[6:26:05] <waifoong98> yeah
[6:26:09] <arkv01> @gunsrlove I'm already butternutting Kreygasm
[6:26:13] <Hydrapissed> no threats no nothing this fight
[6:26:18] <waifoong98> and you have to do it all over if you die at any phase
[6:26:20] <+Kaask> The big issue again is, everyone was asking for a remake for years. They finally announced it, and that's not what we got. The game is fine, but it's not what people expected, or were expressly told they were getting.
[6:26:20] <+NukeDaHippies> It's so out of place too
[6:26:21] <+ConLin_Arts_> I think I read that the expanded FF7 stuff will only be slight mentions, never fully shown, only one that is in is like Kyrie that was from one of the novels
[6:26:26] <frostycrinkle> you don't like fighting the same 3 enemies over and over with cutscenes that pull the camera away mid fight?
[6:26:31] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> sephiroth is a time traveler and they show AC stuff its kind of implied that its the same Seph post everything that went down after AC
[6:26:33] <sad_toast_> yep
[6:26:38] <Sokumotanaka> I hope cait sith comes back with a gun
[6:26:39] <+jiggy_snipe> well tbf most of the boss fights are set pieces if you really think about the multiple stages of each boss
[6:26:44] <seth45er> Defeat the heart of darkness!
[6:26:47] <Macfine> @KaiserMario I'm sure that's a valid opinion. I just didn't hold the original to very high regard to begin with. So i am trying to place myself and where i may fit into enjoying it
[6:26:52] <Tikigod784> wait for it
[6:26:53] <Hydrapissed> oh yah
[6:26:53] <+sin_grimmly> Red is doing stardust ray
[6:26:55] <Tikigod784> waaaaaaait for it
[6:26:56] <Hydrapissed> its a 180 of it
[6:26:58] <sad_toast_> "THEY FLY NIW"
[6:26:59] <+Gigagoat> the whisper bosses are super uninteresting deisgn wise.
[6:27:10] <+NukeDaHippies> yup......Betrayed is the only word that comes to mind
[6:27:11] <Krimxon> If this game had still ended with them sat outside the city talking about what comes next it would have been fine
[6:27:12] <kiwicoffin> I wonder where Don Corneo is now
[6:27:16] <+EpicureanIguana> why, do you not like it when your characters are replaced with meta commentary robots?
[6:27:21] <gunsrlove> " Why dont we have our current weapons"
[6:27:23] <Sergiroth> Just something that is happening because reasons and padding
[6:27:25] <Dereh0g> What's with Cloud's face?
[6:27:26] <waifoong98> lol
[6:27:28] <sad_toast_> FMV!
[6:27:30] <Hydrapissed> god yah go plow him
[6:27:31] <+NukeDaHippies> This next part is ever worse
[6:27:35] <arkv01> come fuck me urself, coward
[6:27:36] <SnickSnack666> The worst part is if you die at anypoint during the boss fight you start over at the bridge, its way to long
[6:27:41] <KaiserMario> @Macfine Honestly Your enjoyment is only up to you, don't let us grumps make you feel like you shouldn't like it or something...
[6:27:41] <Huntercd> Why What?
[6:27:47] <noremac0uo> don't keep ur girl waiting
[6:27:49] <waifoong98> bullshit, barrett, bullshit
[6:27:50] <Sokumotanaka> DEAD
[6:27:52] <+justianxix> Just spoiler all the cool parts of the later game will yeah
[6:27:54] <Tikigod784> nah, this is supernova materia
[6:27:55] <sosandstorm> Red actually looks good though
[6:27:55] <arkv01> is that the fucking meteor
[6:28:00] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Sephiroth is just Dio over heaven now
[6:28:04] <BillieNoMates> time ghost counter !
[6:28:07] <arkv01> time GHOSTS ASSEMBLE
[6:28:09] <+PleasantLee> Hey Eli. Remember when you said the game would go Advent Children? well...here you go. The lighting, the moves, the animations are exact. EXACT!
[6:28:09] <gnollAUS> If you killed the time ghost boss. Can we please have no more of those dumb ass ghosts?
[6:28:10] <Hydrapissed> PEOPLE who are new are gana be so confusseeddd lol
[6:28:12] <BillieNoMates> Get fucked Sephiroth
[6:28:14] <BillieNoMates> Wait
[6:28:14] <Macfine> @KaiserMario oh I'm not, i,m just gauging reactions to better form my prediction so to speak
[6:28:16] <+Kaask> we advent children now
[6:28:17] <BillieNoMates> He absorbed them
[6:28:22] <arkv01> he became lavos!

[6:28:40] <+NukeDaHippies> Get ready for the worst fan service bullshit you've EVER seen
[6:28:40] <Dementedpenguin> They're acting like Sephiroth is Death Vader at this point. "You just know him" Kappa
[6:28:40] <sad_toast_> he absorbed it's Power
[6:28:41] <ovan20> Plague, are you fighting the erase the original story? D:
[6:28:46] <Dementedpenguin> *darth
[6:28:47] <Hydrapissed> REMEBMER that door he couldnt cut
[6:28:48] <+PleasantLee> fucked up midgar, all grey and shit
[6:28:49] <fluffy_sauce> Nomura -"Oh, you haven't played FF7 before? Well fuck you."
[6:28:49] <Coffee_JD> More is BETTER
[6:28:49] <Whyverns> BUT CANT YOUR CHARACTER BEAT METEOR EMPOWERED SEPHIROTH WITH GENOVA CELLS AND GEOSTYGMA POWERS
[6:28:51] <+PleasantLee> sephiroths stance
[6:28:54] <+PleasantLee> moves
[6:28:55] <%caramello_man> man it bums me out people are impressed by this
[6:28:57] <+PleasantLee> its all the same
[6:28:58] <penitentpentwitch> That Sephiroth boss fight your predicted
[6:28:58] <+justianxix> Exactly . HOW
[6:28:59] <waifoong98> you know
[6:29:00] <Ophiuchas> less is less more is more 🤭
[6:29:01] <waifoong98> THAT
[6:29:07] <KaiserMario> @Macfine If you don't care much for the original though, I'd say you wouldn't care much for this one too... It was clearly made FOR the fans
[6:29:09] <arkv01> ITS HAPPENING PLAGUE
[6:29:11] <+EpicureanIguana> Nomura is just like Kojima
[6:29:13] <gunsrlove> With more bullshit. You one up things with scale as a lot of japanese media shows us
[6:29:14] <Huntercd> Why was there a train
[6:29:18] <waifoong98> LUL deal with it
[6:29:19] <Tikigod784> CHOO CHOO
[6:29:21] <seth45er> its the music for that one thing!
[6:29:26] <sad_toast_> Nomura Nut..
[6:29:29] <SnickSnack666> you can do this in alot of boss fights
[6:29:33] <Hydrapissed> poison sephiroth lol
[6:29:35] <Macfine> I'm guessing you can;'t suplex that train :(
[6:29:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:29:51] <+NukeDaHippies> This entire game has 0 subtly. Every time theres a red herring, there may awsell be a neon sign saying, "THIS IS IMPORTANT"
[6:29:53] <Tikigod784> I C L A P P E D
[6:29:56] <+PleasantLee> deadly dodge is good, just dodge and mash attack midroll
[6:30:02] <frostycrinkle> Imagine how lame the Midgar Zolom reveal will be after all this
[6:30:07] <+jiggy_snipe> @EpicureanIguana well Kojima is a hack but I love his nonsense lol
[6:30:07] <hellfirejefe> sepiroth nut has been busted so hard
[6:30:08] <+justianxix> Are we going to fight Sephiroth in Space with fucking Mech like Gurren Lagan in the final boss of the last remake
[6:30:09] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> ... Do I detect a hint of Save Wizard? lol
[6:30:10] <penitentpentwitch> Cure?
[6:30:11] <+Kaask> yeah you just attack while rolling. never found much use for it though.
[6:30:11] <SnickSnack666> you spent way to much time farming some materia
[6:30:14] <arkv01> yeah I don't understand how the midgar zolom is going to do shit after this
[6:30:17] <+Gigagoat> steal :3
[6:30:18] <Hydrapissed> lol yah wtf are they gana do at the big moments in the og
[6:30:23] <Sokumotanaka> @Tikigod784 When did you clapped/
[6:30:30] <Hydrapissed> are the weapons gana be like flying around the universe?
[6:30:32] <Krimxon> Farmed all that materia when it's easier postgame LUL
[6:30:37] <waifoong98> clap clap clap
[6:30:37] <+Kaask> i spammed parry on tifa a lot just to get around
[6:30:38] <TheWe4pon> man I hope the high ups that made this game get covid
[6:30:42] <Tikigod784> clap
[6:30:47] <fluffy_sauce> AT-ST! AT-ST!
[6:30:47] <Trinity5> noooooo he has not
[6:30:48] <+NukeDaHippies> I feel like nomura is turning this into star wats
[6:30:50] <seth45er> IT BROKE NEW GROUND!!
[6:30:50] <Hydrapissed> AT ST
[6:30:51] <Tikigod784> Dab on 'im Cloud
[6:30:54] <arkv01> but you know they gotta, kingdom hearts is a big franchise :)
[6:30:55] <+PleasantLee> memberberries, member advent children?

[6:31:08] <Tikigod784> er, Rogue One
[6:31:08] <Krimxon> @TheWe4pon ever think you're taking video games too seriously?
[6:31:09] <MilkingEdge> ROGUE ONE
[6:31:10] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> the thing that is actually anmoying is for all the padding they couldnt take 5 minutes to talk about sephiroth, like i get why they didnt in the original but this game onteoduced jok in chapter 2 and made him the final boss
[6:31:10] <sosandstorm> Rogue one was alright
[6:31:15] <+justianxix> Atleast that kinda made sense
[6:31:19] <arkv01> rogue one just a buncha nobodies LUL
[6:31:19] <+NukeDaHippies> Red Letter Media??
[6:31:21] <Ophiuchas> you know you're going to have to go off on 2hours tangents of sub questing before you're even allowed to get to midgar zolom
[6:31:25] <examplez0> The RedLetterMedia review is infinitely more memorable than the movie itself
[6:31:31] <+firmlygraspi1> I despised it
[6:31:32] <seth45er> ITS BROKE NEW GROUND!!!!
[6:31:35] <Trinity5> yeah rogue one was fine
[6:31:38] <+jiggy_snipe> that's why this is a sequel
[6:31:40] <examplez0> HOLY SHIT HE HAD A RED LIGHTSABER AND HE USED THE FORCE
[6:31:43] <Tikigod784> Vader had more establishing scenes in that than Sephiroth did in this
[6:31:43] <gnollAUS> Rogue one
[6:31:47] <BlackSunBlood> i love video game!
[6:31:50] <+NukeDaHippies> THEY BROKE NEW GROUND!! O_o
[6:31:51] <seth45er> rouge Juan
[6:31:51] <arkv01> rogue one was a lot more fine than solo
[6:31:52] <Coffee_JD> shaddup
[6:31:55] <waifoong98> "eh mah gawd vader made a pun"
[6:31:55] <+JamesCorck> Plague, what is the level of Memberberries of this game?
[6:31:59] <shevan123> oh my god
[6:31:59] <MilkingEdge> SHUT UP
[6:31:59] <+firmlygraspi1> is that Kingdom Hearts Cloud?
[6:32:01] <KaiserMario> Hey how about bringing the Emperror back... that'd be stupid! Oh wait...
[6:32:01] <kiwicoffin> Shut up, bitch
[6:32:03] <+EpicureanIguana> @jiggy_snipe oh, i meant that they are both awful at keeping it subtle. At least Kojima explains his nonsense, in detail and repeatedly LUL
[6:32:11] <arkv01> oh boy that sephiroth hp bar
[6:32:26] <Sokumotanaka> Stand? STAND!? JOOOOOOOOOOOJO
[6:32:35] <+jiggy_snipe> @EpicureanIguana hmm good point, maybe thats why I like him lol
[6:32:40] <waifoong98> shhh don't question it
[6:32:40] <KaiserMario> This matches exactly Advent Children
[6:32:44] <GilliamYaeger> About level 15-20 in the original
[6:32:48] <Trinity5> yeah it'd be way better if cloud and party got stomped and this was the end of the game
[6:32:53] <fluffy_sauce> well, you did level grind to 50
[6:32:56] <BillieNoMates> Levels are a game mechanic, not a story theme.
[6:32:56] <Tikigod784> huh
[6:32:58] <arkv01> cloud absorbed all his AC powers the moment he crossed the portal
[6:33:02] <Huntercd> Shouldn't the fate talk be when Cloud finds out he's an experiment?
[6:33:02] <reiface08> huh
[6:33:04] <Tikigod784> Whoever you choose appears in this boss fight first
[6:33:08] <reiface08> tifa showed up first for me? that's weird
[6:33:08] <+NukeDaHippies> We're Dragon Ball Z now
[6:33:13] <+justianxix> Its annoying
[6:33:13] <Tikigod784> Max and others got Tifa in that first scene
[6:33:13] <Kyni> huh i got tifa first
[6:33:18] <+NukeDaHippies> Our candidate can do no wrong
[6:33:23] <+Kaask> maybe its who you pick up first in the sewers
[6:33:25] <shevan123> and.thats terrible
[6:33:32] <Sokumotanaka> How do you get barret first?
[6:33:35] <Trinity5> i bet it's based on what resolution you get in chapter 14
[6:33:37] <Kejang> WATCH THE MOVIE PLAGUE
[6:33:44] <TheWe4pon> he picked tifa first in the sewers
[6:33:51] <BlackSunBlood> there's so much happening in every frame!
[6:33:55] <Macfine> slamming action figures together
[6:33:58] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @Kaask nope, I picked Tifa but got Aerith too
[6:34:01] <+Kaask> ah, no idea then. i dont remember who i got
[6:34:02] <waifoong98> god now I can't imagine how much worse Versus 13 is now lol
[6:34:12] <+thefakeh> aerith is a tie fighter now
[6:34:13] <+EpicureanIguana> yall can keep your Tifas and your eereths i will claim barret for myself
[6:34:19] <Trinity5> see why couldn't every boss fight have had a move after the stagger
[6:34:23] <Trinity5> and then you keep the stagger
[6:34:24] <Trinity5> ffs
[6:34:26] <+NukeDaHippies> Max's entire stream was "i clapped when i saw it", I was hoping people would see the crap that is this ending
[6:34:30] <arkv01> aeris stay back, this man is dangerous to your well being ScaredyCat
[6:34:43] <KaiserMario> Plague, please search fo Cloud vs Sephiroth in Advent Children! I swear to god!
[6:34:44] <BlackSunBlood> le epic
[6:34:46] <+PleasantLee> why are they fighting?
[6:34:48] <MilkingEdge> GOING FULL NOMURA
[6:34:50] <waifoong98> u wish
[6:34:51] <+Kaask> i hope so
[6:34:55] <arkv01> yes
[6:34:58] <SnickSnack666> Dont diss fanfiction, some ive read is way better then this
[6:34:59] <Huntercd> Ojno
[6:35:02] <availablethor> What ever was that that wing by the way? In the original.
[6:35:05] <arkv01> cloud has the BIGGEST beef with sephiroth in KH
[6:35:07] <Trinity5> about to bring dissidia in
[6:35:10] <arkv01> and theres NO backstory behind it
[6:35:10] <seth45er> this could of been a sword fight on the highway ending when Sephi dies the sunrise's
[6:35:12] <kiwicoffin> All this started in Kindom Hearts
[6:35:13] <penitentpentwitch> The 'Third' game may just be Final Fantasy: Chrono Cross
[6:35:14] <Sokumotanaka> I want Cait Sith to come with a gun and shoot sephiroth and step on his neck and put a few bullets in his head and then be the final boss.
[6:35:22] <+NukeDaHippies> @PlagueOfGripes Oh crap.....you could be 100% right...that would explain alot
[6:35:26] <+jiggy_snipe> i mean wany ork of fiction can be alternative dimension if you want it to be
[6:35:32] <arkv01> final fantasy started at Kingdom Hearts
[6:35:35] <+KawaiiJetty> Kingdom Hearts 2 had Cloud and Sephiroth fight dimension away lol
[6:35:35] <SnickSnack666> only charecter usefull in this fight is cloud
[6:35:46] <KaiserMario> Chadley is the real final boss
[6:35:52] <Huntercd> How does he even fly with one wing?
[6:35:55] <+NukeDaHippies> He homes in on you harder then anytrhing before
[6:36:02] <GilliamYaeger> rip aeris
[6:36:05] <@Nightbot> @Hydrapissed -> Who the heck are you? My evil twin? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[6:36:12] <hellfirejefe> goddammit I wish this was just a jenova fight and not this bizarre cinematic bullshit
[6:36:12] <%LordSDB> Kh move
[6:36:16] <gunsrlove> NO BRAIN ONLY FIGHT
[6:36:18] <arkv01> this looks rad though
[6:36:19] <+justianxix> NotLikeThis LUL
[6:36:23] <reiface08> anyone else felt this was unearned and had no build up
[6:36:25] <Macfine> it feels like this was thrown in, incase they didn't make more
[6:36:28] <SnickSnack666> he wanted to kill aerith again
[6:36:35] <availablethor> @reiface08 yes
[6:36:38] <waifoong98> @reiface08 this earn something? LUL
[6:36:44] <Sokumotanaka> UGH
[6:36:45] <%LordSDB> Just press the traingle prompt Kappa
[6:36:58] <Sergiroth> This is a mess...
[6:37:00] <+NukeDaHippies> Look at the level of dragon ball Z fight. No one here has any stake in this fight. Possibly not even cloud
[6:37:02] <+justianxix> Such a good fake out
[6:37:05] <arkv01> the demo was a honeypot
[6:37:05] <Dementedpenguin> Simpler times
[6:37:06] <+PleasantLee> why couldnt you jsut make to the end of the highway, sephiroths theres for realsies this time and everyone else can see him, you fight abit but he gets away. and then clouds like "I'm going after him" and then everyone shrugs and goes "whats the deal with sephiroth?"
[6:37:09] <Kejang> revel in the nomura juice
[6:37:09] <SnickSnack666> it was all it needed to be
[6:37:10] <+justianxix> Just like MGS2
[6:37:12] <+EpicureanIguana> I remember you asking if it got worse than time ghosts LUL
[6:37:16] <availablethor> It was literally a lie
[6:37:16] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> this bossfight exists because even they knew time ghosts was too weak to end on
[6:37:25] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Y'know, a Tri-Fusion of Tifa, Aerith and Jessie might be in order
[6:37:29] <Ekaelis> This is such a different experience compared to watching Max play LUL
[6:37:30] <availablethor> SE packaged this Rebuild as a Remake
[6:37:36] <Sokumotanaka> Why is barret now treated like the second dog and paired off with red and disappears as long as red does?
[6:37:46] <Ophiuchas> well first time aeris meets sephiroth it's the last time, now it's the first of many
[6:37:48] <+Kaask> waifus
[6:37:54] <sosandstorm> they should have ended with the Decepticon we fought earlier
[6:38:03] <Daskolin> Yes. They should call this game Final FAntasy VII: Kingdom Nomura
[6:38:10] <Happy_Karl> @justianxix Holy shit you're right. The demo was just the tanker level.
[6:38:11] <Macfine> @Sokumotanaka i assume because he isn't in the party
[6:38:11] <+JamesCorck> This music wasn't made to be looped, good grief.
[6:38:12] <+NukeDaHippies> I couldn't believe that max didn't bat an eye lash at this part at all.
[6:38:22] <+NukeDaHippies> I was simply stunned
[6:38:27] <Trinity5> you couldn't?
[6:38:28] <reiface08> this is nomura's crater now
[6:38:29] <noremac0uo> I think the comment that Nomura doesn't know how many games the remake will be tells me he hasn't written the whole story yet.
[6:38:32] <waifoong98> @NukeDaHippies don't listen to Max opinion on RPG lol
[6:38:40] <Trinity5> he's been riding for the game pretty hard
[6:38:41] <+EpicureanIguana> Oh... it just clicked in my head, this game was never intended for newcomers or ff7 fanboys. Its all about the KH fans
[6:38:51] <Ryan1016> How dare Max like something
[6:38:59] <kiwicoffin> Max knew what this was
[6:39:06] <GilliamYaeger> Save the limit
[6:39:07] <+justianxix> @Happy_Karl In the long run, I don't know how well recieved this will be compared to MGS2, but I'll still hate the story
[6:39:11] <examplez0> You're doing far better at this than I am
[6:39:11] <GilliamYaeger> There's a damage race at the end
[6:39:21] <availablethor> capitalism kills art
[6:39:29] <+NukeDaHippies> @waifoong98 But max isn't stupid y'know? I guess thats jsut blind fandom for ya
[6:39:43] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @noremac0uo Yeah pretty sure nomura is just throwing shit at the wall and he will figure it out later after feedback
[6:39:44] <Phoenixianstyle> I do actually like this wants you to switch back and forth like that adds the anime factor lol
[6:39:47] <waifoong98> @NukeDaHippies I know, but he doesn't even play a lot of RPG anw
[6:39:56] <TueDuffCity> Nomura isn't the writer
[6:40:06] <Happy_Karl> @justianxix We'll just have to wait 5 years to see how it ends.
[6:40:07] <Sokumotanaka> They said they also wanted to remake ff6 and 9 and yeah I think they should leave them alone
[6:40:08] <GilliamYaeger> Summon Bahamut now
[6:40:10] <Ophiuchas> I don't think max wants to wreck the relationship he's got with SE over a game, which makes sense
[6:40:21] <arkv01> how many times does this guy have to summon meteor IN DISC 1
[6:40:25] <Ryan1016> OR
[6:40:26] <valriot> Man theres some boomer energy in here
[6:40:26] <Macfine> does he do the attack where he destroys the whole solar system for 300 dmg?
[6:40:26] <+jiggy_snipe> Seph just too strong for fate like Jiren can't be stopped by time
[6:40:28] <+justianxix> People just don't actually care about writing quality or good storytelling, they Just like to clap when they see the thing
[6:40:30] <law240> he's controling the ghosts
[6:40:32] <noremac0uo> @chester_goes_berserk and also so the remakes can be drawn out for as long as square wants
[6:40:38] <Ryan1016> OR, he just likes it, shocking
[6:40:40] <Ryan1016> Christ chat
[6:40:41] <+KawaiiJetty> It's the happy sound of Meteor
[6:40:41] <Krimxon> @Ophiuchas I don't think that's it though, because he goes so hard in the other direction praising it
[6:40:52] <Krimxon> @Ophiuchas I think he's just fanboying hard right now
[6:40:53] <Bustahhwulf> seph sucked in plot ghosts and took their power
[6:40:56] <+PleasantLee> this is why you always equip magnify to heal
[6:41:02] <arkv01> this might be dangerous plague
[6:41:08] <hellfirejefe> I hope in the next game they pretend this just didn't happen
[6:41:09] <SupportWriter> @Ryan1016 Max is totally a game of the week twitch character
[6:41:12] <frostycrinkle> watch out for those mmo raid aoes
[6:41:15] <Trinity5> is there only one magnify materia in the game?
[6:41:18] <reiface08> pls don't die plague we don't want this to start over
[6:41:24] <SupportWriter> Like his on and off relationship with Guilty gear
[6:41:34] <valriot> Imagine not liking a game, that suddenly you shit talk Max. Holy shit.
[6:41:36] <Ryan1016> FF7 has been a favorite of his for forever
[6:41:36] <Sokumotanaka> @Ryan1016 No I agree but there's no winning here, just ignore them and talk about something that wont annoy you
[6:41:37] <Ophiuchas> @krimxon oh I believe that's an element too
[6:41:42] <arkv01> megapot it up
[6:41:50] <arkv01> oh fuck
[6:41:52] <+NukeDaHippies> I think thats a win
[6:42:02] <+PleasantLee> you did it!
[6:42:04] <arkv01> DO IT YOU GLORIOUS DRAGON
[6:42:06] <examplez0> Noice
[6:42:06] <kiwicoffin> Bahamut wins fuck you
[6:42:12] <GilliamYaeger> This part is so cheesy
[6:42:18] <SnickSnack666> its like why are the ghost helping sephirote
[6:42:19] <+PleasantLee> red is too dignified for head pats
[6:42:21] <+NukeDaHippies> Red XII would be SO confused
[6:42:21] <cerazor01> he will not get headpats
[6:42:22] <Kejang> noooooo
[6:42:24] <waifoong98> the script
[6:42:26] <Tikigod784> CANON ISN'T CANON
[6:42:28] <+KawaiiJetty> Amazing strats LUL
[6:42:28] <arkv01> you can (not) pet the dog in ff7
[6:42:30] <KaiserMario> MAKE IT WRONG
[6:42:33] <sendart> Yes she read the script
[6:42:35] <Dementedpenguin> Oh god, this is the Goku Black arc now
[6:42:38] <Eger007> course she did
[6:42:40] <BillieNoMates> Advent Children prequel
[6:42:42] <Medo3G> wtf
[6:42:43] <arkv01> aeris be like heheh how about this time tifa dies
[6:42:43] <kiwicoffin> Everyone gets face time for the finale
[6:42:44] <Macfine> why is space?
[6:42:47] <Ryan1016> The plot ghosts literally showed them the future
[6:42:49] <BillieNoMates> Not FF7 remake LUL
[6:42:51] <+NukeDaHippies> FF7 is wrong people! We can make it right! We can make it nomura
[6:42:52] <+PleasantLee> I think...THINK he is some how controlling them
[6:42:53] <Phoenixianstyle> what am I looking at here?
[6:43:01] <hellfirejefe> oh god aeris isn't going to die is she?
[6:43:01] <noremac0uo> so why should the cast be threatened of sephiroth in the next games when they've seemingly beaten him here
[6:43:02] <Kejang> This truly is Final Fantasy 7 Re;Make
[6:43:03] <examplez0> Final Fantasy fans have even lower standards than Dragon Ball fans
[6:43:05] <kingra> It's FF7 remade
[6:43:06] <GilliamYaeger> He's probably controlling them after you weakened them
[6:43:06] <kiwicoffin> He was the ghosts the whole time?
[6:43:06] <arkv01> the fuck
[6:43:08] <Dereh0g> He is the time ghosts
[6:43:13] <Tikigod784> FF7 Birth By Sephiroth
[6:43:16] <reiface08> is nomura just the zack snyder of JRPGs
[6:43:17] <+jiggy_snipe> it seems like Sephiroth is controlling the ghosts
[6:43:17] <cerazor01> They're trying to stop you from fighting him.
[6:43:18] <wsazasz> He vroomed them after you beat the big one
[6:43:18] <Sokumotanaka> Where's goku?
[6:43:19] <law240> you killed most of the ghosts
[6:43:20] <sosandstorm> It's a ghost sephiroth... i think?
[6:43:20] <Bustahhwulf> sephiroth already sucked in the ghosts power when he did the supernova
[6:43:20] <penitentpentwitch> And everyone became a Timelord
[6:43:21] <Huntercd> So will Aeris fuck Red now?
[6:43:22] <Ophiuchas> I hope those ghosts are well and truly laid to rest and they just get on with the same game
[6:43:22] <+JamesCorck> Now Plague, it doesn't matter how much you don't like this game, at least it will not be as insulting as Star Trek Picard.
[6:43:24] <Macfine> Sephiroth is the ghosts you met along the way
[6:43:27] <arkv01> stargate SG1!
[6:43:28] <Whyverns> look at that jimmy neutron brain blast
[6:43:31] <+NukeDaHippies> Yep....
[6:43:37] <Dementedpenguin> Kiss
[6:43:38] <cerazor01> They're gonna hold hands
[6:43:38] <waifoong98> fujoshi bait
[6:43:38] <Sokumotanaka> KISS
[6:43:39] <GilliamYaeger> HOW ROMANTIC THEY'RE HOLDING HANDS
[6:43:44] <GilliamYaeger> KAWAII UGUU
[6:43:45] <Ryan1016> moon2L
[6:43:48] <Kejang> Star Trek been dead for years though
[6:43:49] <Ophiuchas> damn* game
[6:43:50] <Sir__Nova> Just turn your brain off, it's not worth it
[6:43:51] <+Gigagoat> :3
[6:43:51] <arkv01> careful now, you're in the lemon dimension now
[6:43:55] <+justianxix> At least the game is still fun to play
[6:44:05] <Handsome0ne> Fights have been going for so long already that I forgotten completely the orinigal plot...
[6:44:07] <+NukeDaHippies> This is so fuckin....*sigh*
[6:44:09] <waifoong98> you kid but
[6:44:10] <+PleasantLee> I really hate they didnt change your weapon to buster sword for this cutscene
[6:44:12] <waifoong98> ...
[6:44:12] <arkv01> ye he looking at kingdom hearts
[6:44:12] <Whyverns> fuck you
[6:44:13] <sosandstorm> IT'S ACTUALLY KINGDOM HEARTS
[6:44:13] <+Gigagoat> No kingdom hearts isn't allowed sexual tension
[6:44:15] <examplez0> Cue the yaoi fanfics
[6:44:16] <Ophiuchas> i do love the ancients theme
[6:44:17] <availablethor> Kingdom Heart was a mitake.
[6:44:19] <BillieNoMates> This is how empty Nomura's head is
[6:44:21] <smugfox95> blurry space jpg
[6:44:22] <Dereh0g> This is the Square offices
[6:44:27] <arkv01> the EDGE of our dimension, we must ride the gummi ship to new worlds
[6:44:28] <Sokumotanaka> Wait techically this is Jenova right? So it's not gay
[6:44:30] <Macfine> join me on the darkside
[6:44:32] <Medo3G> we haven't created any more environments
[6:44:33] <Tikigod784> Cloud I am your father because we're owned by Disney
[6:44:34] <+NukeDaHippies> wait for it
[6:44:37] <Kejang> but destiny is destiny tho
[6:44:39] <kingra> He's not Darth Vader Nomura
[6:44:41] <+KawaiiJetty> Sephiroth thinking about the shower scene with Cloud
[6:44:41] <SnickSnack666> I noticed something was wrong with the game when cloud knew he killed sephirote in Nibelheim
[6:44:43] <arkv01> destiny is destiny
[6:44:44] <+terry_quest> why does he keep saying nomura is the writer``?
[6:44:44] <snowmanse> The Nail Bat would've been great here.
[6:44:55] <KaiserMario> oh no the quick cuts...
[6:44:59] <Huntercd> What destiny?
[6:45:00] <+jiggy_snipe> Sephiroth is such a jackass, did he forget that he murdered Cloud's family?
[6:45:02] <Macfine> cloud is yoda
[6:45:02] <waifoong98> clap clap clap
[6:45:05] <BillieNoMates> BLEACH
[6:45:06] <+PleasantLee> animeee
[6:45:07] <kiwicoffin> I saw someone go in with the nail bat out of spite
[6:45:07] <arkv01> he doing ghetto omnislash
[6:45:13] <Sokumotanaka> Anime!
[6:45:14] <Kampler21> this fanfic getting insane
[6:45:15] <Ophiuchas> so basically here's your fan service, here's your OG game, now get lost
[6:45:20] <+NukeDaHippies> This is so pandery it hurts
[6:45:21] <fluffy_sauce> what is this dragon ball teleporting shit?
[6:45:29] <Sokumotanaka> Let us just play the game
[6:45:32] <+KawaiiJetty> Except no shirtless Sephiroth
[6:45:35] <arkv01> not yet cloud, no cumming yet
[6:45:35] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> "no fate but what we make" That's right, Terminator
[6:45:39] <+PleasantLee> no no no
[6:45:40] <Handsome0ne> It´s like the end of Avengers Endgame movie
[6:45:41] <+PleasantLee> dont count
[6:45:42] <Huntercd> They can't rebel if they they don't know what they are rebelling against
[6:45:42] <GilliamYaeger> This references how long it takes Sephiroth to kill Aeris
[6:45:42] <waifoong98> he is grabbing Cloud arse
[6:45:46] <Phoenixianstyle> @arkv01 LMAO ghetto Omnislash
[6:45:47] <+PleasantLee> its like DIOs stopped time
[6:45:51] <Macfine> avengers endgame end was earned
[6:45:52] <smugfox95> Anime seconds
[6:45:57] <arkv01> breathing down clouds neck Kreygasm
[6:45:57] <GilliamYaeger> It's seven seconds from him appearing to him stabbing Aeris
[6:46:04] <BillieNoMates> So did sephiroth just imply that Cloud is a quick shot?
[6:46:06] <+justianxix> or how long it takes Metor to hit Midgar
[6:46:11] <KaiserMario> THE PLOT
[6:46:14] <kingra> Get this design outta my face
[6:46:15] <Sokumotanaka> Sephiroth throws a road roalla on cloud
[6:46:17] <waifoong98> he has the yaoi sensor
[6:46:22] <GilliamYaeger> We truly were the Final Fantasy Seven Seconds
[6:46:22] <smugfox95> "Where the fuck is my dog?"
[6:46:23] <penitentpentwitch> A bit of an oddly paced wrap up
[6:46:25] <Happy_Karl> "there's some fuckery out there."
[6:46:25] <availablethor> That's scene change was a whiplash.
[6:46:27] <noremac0uo> oh yeah, the actual plot.
[6:46:29] <sosandstorm> fuck i just got whiplash from that scene change
[6:46:32] <BillieNoMates> Hi pat
[6:46:34] <+gothvomit_> least the Rufus fight was pretty cool
[6:46:35] <kiwicoffin> The writers had already gone home by that point
[6:46:39] <reiface08> what does palmer do exactly?
[6:46:39] <Huntercd> Did Rufus dream that?
[6:46:43] <arkv01> mmm tidders
[6:46:48] <+NukeDaHippies> This game is so weird.....You think they understand the game at time, then other times it shows complete lack of understanding of the themes
[6:46:50] <Ophiuchas> lol Palmer's such a creep 😂 love it
[6:46:52] <Coffee_JD> things can still get dumber
[6:46:55] <+jiggy_snipe> @reiface08 Head of HR
[6:46:55] <smugfox95> Time Froth
[6:47:02] <penitentpentwitch> ChronoRoth?
[6:47:02] <Huntercd> Fuck Reeve and them
[6:47:03] <+Gigagoat> Rufus's fanfiction reading wasn't well received
[6:47:03] <arkv01> we're all frothing now
[6:47:04] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> palmer nods and gets excited about torture so they keep inviting him to meetings
[6:47:06] <+TDotGoat> hmmph
[6:47:10] <reiface08> LOL the creep is the head of HR
[6:47:12] <MilkingEdge> HMMPH
[6:47:16] <examplez0> I KNOW WHAT THAT IS
[6:47:31] <GilliamYaeger> Hojo's entire thing is pretending he knows what's going on
[6:47:32] <Eger007> you should go on the next csb podcast and ruin their fun
[6:47:34] <hellfirejefe> who cares about jenova when you have sephiroth and time ghosts
[6:47:34] <waifoong98> here is BS
[6:47:35] <availablethor> He's jut crazy.
[6:47:36] <Coffee_JD> oh by the way
[6:47:38] <Sokumotanaka> "She's trying to get outta playing child support again!"
[6:47:38] <arkv01> hojo's in on this anime bullshit
[6:47:39] <penitentpentwitch> The guard just ignoring him in the background
[6:47:39] <+NukeDaHippies> THEY BROKE NEW GROUND!!!
[6:47:44] <Huntercd> Hojo just climaxed
[6:47:44] <Ophiuchas> watch the doggy
[6:47:47] <reiface08> STAMP
[6:47:47] <waifoong98> and his voice is so bad now
[6:47:51] <Lucier921> palmer straight up looks like a killer klown from outer space minus the clown makeup
[6:47:55] <arkv01> NEW STAMP
[6:47:58] <+PleasantLee> I swear the dogs name was stump at the start of the game
[6:47:59] <BillieNoMates> Zack remembered his potions this time
[6:48:04] <%LordSDB> OG timeline
[6:48:12] <+NukeDaHippies> I'll be honest.....I could go for more zack...not like this tho
[6:48:17] <availablethor> There he is.
[6:48:18] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> @Eger007 Ooo that would be a great spoilercast
[6:48:19] <Macfine> It's vegeta cloud
[6:48:19] <snowmanse> This part is incredibly weird. It's like they just wanted to tell people "Hey, Zack got a happy ending somewhere"
[6:48:20] <Kejang> whyyyy
[6:48:24] <GilliamYaeger> WHY DID MIDGAR EXPLODE
[6:48:24] <smugfox95> clouds boyfriend
[6:48:25] <BillieNoMates> Midgar just got nuked
[6:48:26] <BillieNoMates> LUL
[6:48:27] <law240> "Just google it"
[6:48:29] <cerazor01> why does he have no blood or bullet wounds?
[6:48:30] <BillieNoMates> WUTAI FOREVER
[6:48:32] <wsazasz> This was the crisis core version
[6:48:33] <Ryan1016> Plot ghosts go boom
[6:48:36] <+NukeDaHippies> Angry Joe didn't understand ANY OF THIS
[6:48:36] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Who is this I didn't play FF7OG
[6:48:37] <+Kaask> you beat the ghosts, so they didnt make zack die
[6:48:51] <%LordSDB> There were whispers but now there all gone @PlagueOfGripes
[6:48:52] <Bustahhwulf> they then get in a truck that gets stopped by 2 scouts and zack gets capped to death LUL
[6:48:54] <+JamesCorck> Oh fuck, I forgot the word geostigma existed.
[6:48:54] <waifoong98> magical horseshit
[6:48:55] <cerazor01> the time ghosts left
[6:48:55] <availablethor> wait what?
[6:48:57] <Sokumotanaka> Well barret, aerith, tifa and red are dead now
[6:49:00] <+justianxix> Wait, how did Angry Joe react to any of this?
[6:49:03] <Ophiuchas> it's a terrier type now so we've.. splintered that timeline into a new branch, so the beagle type stamp still exists which I'm guessing is that original game
[6:49:04] <law240> you killed time ghost
[6:49:06] <gnollAUS> *Looks up* There are plenty of clouds.
[6:49:06] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Kappa
[6:49:06] <Tikigod784> ghosts weren't gonna let Zack in
[6:49:15] <Tikigod784> now he's gonna hit the town
[6:49:15] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA FIELD
[6:49:15] <+terry_quest> you defeated the plot ghosts
[6:49:16] <+JamesCorck> Fucking hell Plague, I think I hate this now XD you had to remind me of the word geostigma XD damnit.
[6:49:19] <+terry_quest> and no he cant
[6:49:24] <Ryan1016> He doesn't see them
[6:49:24] <+OnTheDonner> We killed the will of the planet guys!! We did it!!!
[6:49:24] <Djinnazz> you klled the time ghosts.
[6:49:25] <+PleasantLee> go sleep Eli, you've earned it
[6:49:25] <+jiggy_snipe> i don't think he actually say them
[6:49:28] <kiwicoffin> It doesn't matter now because you beat them. And Sephiroth or something
[6:49:32] <Huntercd> Recon ghosts died?
[6:49:32] <Eger007> You should ruin this game for pat and woolie
[6:49:34] <arkv01> pats gonna gush
[6:49:35] <+Kaask> pats going to tear this apart
[6:49:36] <Daskolin> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[6:49:37] <necrensha> yeah
[6:49:37] <availablethor> I do not understand what Nomura wants to do here. I kind of understand the rest on a metanarrative level but what is this Zack shit about?
[6:49:37] <+JamesCorck> Pat already is.
[6:49:39] <Tikigod784> Woolie will love the Rufus fight
[6:49:44] <arkv01> woolie's gonna chuckle
[6:49:45] <Kejang> and they shit on Kingdom Hearts LUL
[6:49:47] <penitentpentwitch> Now that the time ghosts are defeated, everyone gets a happy ending. Especially Sephiroth, who can time travel without punishment now!
[6:49:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:49:50] <+jiggy_snipe> idk Pat hates FF13 and KH
[6:49:51] <GilliamYaeger> Look! Nobody died!
[6:49:52] <+justianxix> Pat already knows the plot so yeah
[6:49:52] <Daskolin> They allready are
[6:49:54] <+Legato_Ambrose> I mean honestly would you rather it just be the exact same game?
[6:49:54] <SeBigBoss> thats woolie to a tee
[6:49:55] <+JamesCorck> Yeah, they're gonna call you things, bleh.
[6:49:56] <+NukeDaHippies> I hate the mindset. It's ignoring the fact that no one new would understand it.
[6:49:58] <examplez0> It subverted my expectations 10/10 best game ever
[6:49:58] <+PleasantLee> I wanted REMAKE. just the game with extended stuff
[6:49:58] <+KawaiiJetty> Well Pat is liking the ghosts
[6:49:59] <sosandstorm> WOAH those I beams are super heavy
[6:50:00] <FrankieFalls> Holy shit how did those guys lift that steel?
[6:50:00] <cerazor01> Go on the podcast and argue with them then
[6:50:01] <BillieNoMates> Zack's world I assume
[6:50:01] <Phoenixianstyle> I'm just confused what's happening?
[6:50:02] <hellfirejefe> pat will probably fall off at the huge time ghost
[6:50:02] <Sokumotanaka> Let's not jump to conclusions
[6:50:03] <Tikigod784> this is Nomura's world now
[6:50:03] <Eger007> SHUT UP THO
[6:50:04] <arkv01> oh fuck its CHRONO TRIGGGGER
[6:50:05] <+jiggy_snipe> Zack's world is more in the past
[6:50:07] <snowmanse> I will say, it's hilarious watching you and Pat stream this simultaneously
[6:50:09] <%LordSDB> Timeline 2 yeah
[6:50:09] <Ophiuchas> this is the new unknown world
[6:50:09] <kiwicoffin> I can already hear Woolie yelling "Yoooo" at Rufus and his gun boosting
[6:50:10] <+thefakeh> as someone who never played ff7, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
[6:50:12] <sosandstorm> i can't believe that guy just through it on his shoulder
[6:50:16] <+jiggy_snipe> OH PAT HATES CHRONO CROSS
[6:50:18] <+EpicureanIguana> 'hmm tasted like ff7 before, now it tastes like shit. I love it!'
[6:50:18] <+PleasantLee> but since we're on this train of alternate timelines now, it'll be interesting to see the differences I guess
[6:50:19] <Macfine> I think so far from the last podcast, Woolie and pat both understand why people dont like it
[6:50:22] <+Kaask> its ya boi
[6:50:22] <+JamesCorck> Their opinion, your opinion, in the end it doesn't even matter-.
[6:50:23] <GilliamYaeger> Jessie's glove on the desk
[6:50:23] <Sokumotanaka> Giostigma@
[6:50:24] <waifoong98> @thefakeh fanfic
[6:50:25] <GilliamYaeger> She survived
[6:50:26] <umbilicalsky9> zack was never dead, he was just outside in the original timeline, everybody knows that
[6:50:28] <Trinity5> biggs big chillin
[6:50:29] <TheWe4pon> wat
[6:50:29] <fluffy_sauce> How dare you not pull square enix's corporate line!
[6:50:30] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> implying jessie might be alive too
[6:50:30] <availablethor> @thefakeh I played it and I don't know either.
[6:50:31] <cerazor01> BIGS IS OKAY??
[6:50:34] <+JamesCorck> What matters is how much money Squeenix makes.
[6:50:34] <Happy_Karl> They're already criticizing you in another dimension Eli.
[6:50:43] <Sokumotanaka> NO NO jessie plese!
[6:50:44] <arkv01> cool, no one dies, thanks nomura!
[6:50:47] <%theComradGeneral> only jesse gets murdered
[6:50:47] <kingra> That's too HARD PLAGUE
[6:50:48] <BillieNoMates> jessie actually died on camera
[6:50:50] <Sokumotanaka> GOOD
[6:50:51] <%theComradGeneral> fuck this game
[6:50:52] <availablethor> Bigg is alive, THIRST is dead.
[6:50:55] <smugfox95> Jessie dead as fuc
[6:50:55] <Huntercd> Where the fuck is Jessie then?
[6:50:56] <+Kaask> yeah that was her glove on biggs desk
[6:50:57] <penitentpentwitch> Plague is really good at reading Nomura's scripts
[6:50:58] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Zack's was a different timeline where he lived. Stamp being different shows that. SO he's alive in one timeline
[6:50:59] <+Legato_Ambrose> Biggs also "died" on camera tho
[6:51:02] <Macfine> Cue the doctor "Everybody lives!
[6:51:04] <+capykami> why would changing fate even bring back dead people?
[6:51:05] <+jiggy_snipe> didn't Biggs die on camera?
[6:51:05] <+Gigagoat> sent to the simp dimension
[6:51:06] <+NukeDaHippies> This feels like KH 3. Everyone comes back to life, without any reasoning. Ignoring the impact their deaths had previously
[6:51:07] <cumurasame> I believe the scan shows that the Harbinger exists in all timelines, so killing them in one kills them in all
[6:51:09] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes her stuff was on the desk she might be fine due to shenanigans
[6:51:10] <+justianxix> tHEY'RE GONNA MAKE YO WORK TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS SHIT THEIR THROWING AT YOU
[6:51:11] <Sokumotanaka> O
[6:51:12] <arkv01> daddys a thirsty little plant now
[6:51:14] <GilliamYaeger> Jessie's glove was on the desk next to Biggs's bed, she probably survived
[6:51:14] <BillieNoMates> Barret is using the Force
[6:51:15] <+TDotGoat> miles away
[6:51:15] <Ophiuchas> Jessie's the one who carried Biggs to safety 😬
[6:51:15] <Tikigod784> i mean so did Biggs, if you consider sighing and moving your head to be a death scene
[6:51:15] <ditrak> @jamescorck they throw so much resource to make this game look great so theres no cashgrab
[6:51:16] <+Ataerus> I gotta say, I am glad I didnt pay money for this
[6:51:17] <MilkingEdge> MARLENE
[6:51:19] <kiwicoffin> I think Marlene can hear the planet's bullshit too
[6:51:20] <Sokumotanaka> I'm so confused
[6:51:26] <heroicspiritavenger> I hate this game because it's removed itself too goddamn far from the original storyline, and thus giving us a faithful fucking updated version of the game was a bold fucking faced lie. Meanwhile, this game doesn't have enough going on to justify it's own existance as a sequel to the story. It pleases no one in my eyes.
[6:51:26] <majesticfail> They do mention who zack was earlier in the game
[6:51:26] <arkv01> they're on the world map now
[6:51:31] <availablethor> Were they not on a highway?
[6:51:33] <Kejang> FUCK IF I KNOW TIFA
[6:51:35] <BillieNoMates> Fuck knows because noone can predict Nomura
[6:51:36] <arkv01> insert disc 3, tifa
[6:51:37] <+PleasantLee> @GilliamYaeger dont get my hopes up
[6:51:42] <%theComradGeneral> notice how much bigger tifas tits are in the CGI
[6:51:46] <SnickSnack666> Evrey time Aerith shake her head I want to punch her
[6:51:47] <Tikigod784> snuggle his feathers, Cloud
[6:51:50] <Handsome0ne> This is all way too stupid and absurd
[6:51:57] <sosandstorm> They just force the buster sword onto your back
[6:51:58] <Sergiroth> Sephiroth is a beautiful bird.
[6:52:05] <Eger007> we can what?
[6:52:07] <+jiggy_snipe> @heroicspiritavenger alot people like it
[6:52:08] <+NukeDaHippies> He never has a black wing in the original game. The black wing is totally Kingdom Hearts
[6:52:08] <Macfine> "This plot is absurd as my hair" Cloud
[6:52:08] <Huntercd> What the hell is going on?
[6:52:09] <%laserbeaming> But Sephiroths are trees
[6:52:14] <arkv01> we can avert my inevitable death, says aeris
[6:52:15] <Daskolin> SEPHIROTO INFINITUM!
[6:52:15] <Sokumotanaka> What's with the zack stuff?
[6:52:16] <reiface08> the nomura timeline
[6:52:16] <Eger007> what are they all talknig about?
[6:52:19] <KaiserMario> OH MY GOD Sephiroth is not that character! This isn't what he was!!!
[6:52:24] <noremac0uo> so there's three now
[6:52:28] <Eger007> does he?
[6:52:28] <heroicspiritavenger> @jiggy_snipe A lot of people voted Trump too
[6:52:29] <+KawaiiJetty> They're gonna continue like in the original, searching for Sephiroth i guess?
[6:52:29] <TueDuffCity> Wing is AC
[6:52:31] <Phoenixianstyle> she was dead so what does she know about that they won? lmao
[6:52:36] <kiwicoffin> Aerith said so and that's all they have to go off of
[6:52:37] <Eger007> how do you know?
[6:52:39] <BillieNoMates> Not even Sephiroth knows if he's going to destroy the planet yet
[6:52:41] <Ryan1016> The plot ghosts showed the meteor
[6:52:42] <+OnTheDonner> An enemy of earth is an enemy of us!!
[6:52:43] <noremac0uo> jenova, livestream and time travel. also clones.
[6:52:46] <smugfox95> aewrith petter barrett and now he knows
[6:52:46] <Handsome0ne> Spoilers Barret!!!
[6:52:49] <+justianxix> Aerith was very vague and unclear
[6:52:50] <+Kaask> hey its raining like when zack died
[6:52:52] <hcsarg1986> Aerith what do you mean we? You die remember?
[6:52:52] <MartiusGW> maybe barret played ff7
[6:52:53] <+OnTheDonner> literally just destroyed the will of the planet
[6:52:57] <waifoong98> LUL
[6:52:57] <+GoldenJive> lmao
[6:52:59] <Sokumotanaka> WHAT!?
[6:53:00] <noremac0uo> theres like 20 of them at least
[6:53:00] <arkv01> screw this remake plot I'm just going to replay the original LUL
[6:53:01] <law240> hi crazy :)
[6:53:02] <FrankieFalls> Wut
[6:53:03] <Dementedpenguin> wtf is this
[6:53:07] <ovan20> what's that on the ground? is that the script...
[6:53:09] <Dementedpenguin> oh
[6:53:10] <+NukeDaHippies> I agree. Kingdom Hearts 3 was the same. FF 15 too
[6:53:11] <MilkingEdge> HURPA DURP
[6:53:14] <wsazasz> Timelines
[6:53:14] <Tikigod784> @jiggy_snipe A lot of people did things, and thanks to that this game sold millions of copies
[6:53:16] <Whyverns> DIFFERENT MEANS GOOD BECAUSE NEW
[6:53:17] <+Kaask> destinys crossroads
[6:53:19] <examplez0> I hope episode 2 bombs
[6:53:19] <Phoenixianstyle> wait?! yeah they don't know that the planet is actually dying til they meet Red13s granddad?
[6:53:22] <+PleasantLee> does cloud have different pauldron on?
[6:53:23] <+Ataerus> jesus christ delete this
[6:53:24] <Sokumotanaka> Zack LIVED!?
[6:53:24] <examplez0> Or at least sells half as much
[6:53:24] <+jiggy_snipe> this is a past alternative timeline
[6:53:25] <sosandstorm> Why is it like this
[6:53:26] <+AnthraxJohnson> Tifa please fart in my mouth
[6:53:28] <Ophiuchas> Zack died in the rain, now he's alive
[6:53:32] <%LordSDB> No past timeline
[6:53:37] <+justianxix> I hate timeline bullshit
[6:53:38] <BillieNoMates> I MISS THE PIZZA
[6:53:42] <+jiggy_snipe> Zack has to still be dead for these characters
[6:53:44] <examplez0> Why does she miss it?
[6:53:46] <Eger007> what does that mean
[6:53:46] <shevan123> welp
[6:53:47] <hellfirejefe> now aeris can have two boyfriends
[6:53:47] <MilkingEdge> THE NOMURA SKY
[6:53:47] <availablethor> There are also several Clouds in the sky right now, and they are crying. VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[6:53:47] <law240> BRUH are you being obtuse on purpose
[6:53:49] <fluffy_sauce> i hate this song
[6:53:49] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> They broke "Destiny" for ALL timelines.
[6:53:50] <Dementedpenguin> LUL
[6:53:51] <+OnTheDonner> The whispers were the will of the planet. they destroyed the whispers
[6:53:56] <Dereh0g> Aerith was 15 when Zack was alive btw LUL
[6:53:57] <TheWe4pon> plz no
[6:53:59] <arkv01> this is a nice credits song though
[6:53:59] <+PleasantLee> it was all going great till about the 80% mark
[6:54:00] <kiwicoffin> THE FIRST NAME
[6:54:00] <Eger007> more farts to smell
[6:54:03] <DaddyVamp777> Wow hahaha
[6:54:03] <waifoong98> destiny is not destiny something something
[6:54:05] <reiface08> he's using the same text effects in KH....
[6:54:07] <Longerbone_ghm> REMOVE NOMURA PLZ
[6:54:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Do you rike it?
[6:54:08] <examplez0> I was expecting you to have a stroke during the ending
[6:54:11] <Ophiuchas> /console @plagueofgripes
[6:54:12] <Coffee_JD> Part 2 gonna be called the unknown journey
[6:54:17] <mrgaster8> yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[6:54:17] <+PleasantLee> these credits are very long btw!
[6:54:24] <+EpicureanIguana> thanks Nomura for saving FF7
[6:54:24] <valriot> Nojima wrote it though, and Directors have less control than producers in Japan
[6:54:24] <SnickSnack666> I really come to despise Nomure and wish he would just quit gaming
[6:54:26] <kingra> TORIYAMA?
[6:54:31] <kiwicoffin> Did you rike it?
[6:54:33] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes just one final question, did you rike it
[6:54:33] <kingra> NOJIMA?
[6:54:34] <Sokumotanaka> If zack lived then cloud would have never do anything
[6:54:36] <arkv01> "did you enjoy my turd stew?"
[6:54:36] <TueDuffCity> Nojima wrote it
[6:54:38] <cumurasame> Is the problem that they lied it was a Remake or do you just dislike the direction overall?
[6:54:41] <+NukeDaHippies> The problem is people are happy to get soemthingnew.....But it's something new written by nomura. All new stuff is so bad, i don't like the next ones chances
[6:54:43] <Whyverns> NOMURA TORIYAMA AND NOJIMA
[6:54:43] <+jiggy_snipe> Toriyama is a co-director, yes
[6:54:44] <snowmanse> He went from Yoda to Scooby Doo.
[6:54:50] <Handsome0ne> Wait, that´s it???
[6:54:51] <Whyverns> WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED THIS TRAGEDY
[6:54:53] <Eger007> he's like kojima but for some reason people take him seriously
[6:54:55] <Zohare> You didn't expect me shitting in your icecream, did you?
[6:54:59] <gazdropish> it's horrible
[6:55:03] <fluffy_sauce> Nomura, please stick to character design....only!
[6:55:03] <+PleasantLee> did you like 80% of it?
[6:55:03] <Ophiuchas> it wasn't subtle about where it was going
[6:55:05] <examplez0> If they wanted something new then WHY THE FUCK WOULD THEY BE HYPED FOR A REMAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE
[6:55:06] <arkv01> I don't think nojima had as big a hand in this, mostly nomura and toriyama cocaine sessions
[6:55:07] <valriot> Plague liking anything LUL
[6:55:13] <+JamesCorck> I'd be bothered that you tore the game a new one, but you've saved me $60 so, thanks Plague <3
[6:55:13] <+KawaiiJetty> Thanks Nojima too
[6:55:14] <kiwicoffin> I at least respect Kojima's open disdain for his fans who take his work seriously
[6:55:18] <noremac0uo> so yeah remake still never going to happen.
[6:55:33] <waifoong98> they can change plot but the fate shit can fuck right off
[6:55:37] <Macfine> it should expand not rewrite
[6:55:38] <Apolonm> Kojima is jealous now
[6:55:43] <+jiggy_snipe> @arkv01 he is the writer and maybe he's with them during their benders lol
[6:55:50] <+NukeDaHippies> Train graveyard is where shit started going really wrong for me
[6:55:50] <valriot> But i already played it
[6:55:54] <+NormenKD> why should it have to be? :(
[6:55:57] <+terry_quest> so people are just mad because its called remake you say?
[6:55:58] <cerazor01> You could make a Video Essay about it
[6:56:01] <Happy_Karl> So they should have RE1 Remake-ified it?
[6:56:04] <+PleasantLee> I liek the bonus quest with jessie and the extended trip to reactor 5, shit like that
[6:56:07] <cerazor01> Or wait until it's all done, but that would be eons away
[6:56:10] <Trinity5> huh i would've thought you hated the combat more than that
[6:56:15] <Eger007> how about boss fights?
[6:56:19] <hcsarg1986> Why does this game not have four party slots?
[6:56:22] <examplez0> The lack of i-frames in the dodge roll
[6:56:27] <duffmd1> kingdom hearts 7 is terrible
[6:56:27] <Ophiuchas> I really wanted to explore other sectors in the game and learn more about shinras influence on the daily lives of the people
[6:56:33] <gensoukaizou> load out sets would be nice
[6:56:33] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Okay now a Tifa, Aerith and Jessie Tri-fusion? ;)
[6:56:34] <cumurasame> Do you think that Part 2 and 3 could change your opinion of this? Even if you think it'd be a long shot?
[6:56:36] <Trinity5> lack of i frames in the dodge roll is a big one
[6:56:38] <noremac0uo> wasnt this just ffxiiis story? the rebelling against fate and all that.
[6:56:38] <Ophiuchas> not chase rats cats and dogs
[6:56:42] <+Kaask> i dont like bosses or quest enemies. the way they instantly change target to YOU when you switch characters, you constantly get knocked down by the lightest hits interrupting all your combos. the combat and characters are fun, but the ai doesnt let you have fun.
[6:56:56] <waifoong98> @noremac0uo at least cloud hasn't become god yet
[6:57:13] <Macfine> stagger has been the focus for a while now..doubt that will change
[6:57:15] <+EpicureanIguana> @PlagueOfGripes did you really expect the big black blob of destiny fight, KH Sephiroth battle at the end of time or whatever the fuck? Cause i sure as hell didnt think they'd bone this game so hard
[6:57:21] <Huntercd> Cloud and two first names
[6:57:31] <+PleasantLee> ahahaha
[6:57:37] <Kejang> side quests sure were ass
[6:57:44] <Sokumotanaka> Whatever happened to wedge?
[6:57:45] <examplez0> I would have thought Genesis is the Tingle of this universe
[6:57:45] <Ophiuchas> yes Jessie's house was great
[6:57:47] <+NukeDaHippies> I didn't like the part after jessies house. It goes way too crazy for what it was suppose to be
[6:57:49] <cumurasame> @noremac0uo to be fair I believe like half the Final Fantasy's actually use Change Fate as a plot point. 12 subverts that intentionally though?
[6:57:57] <SnickSnack666> Underground Labritory was fine as well
[6:58:03] <reiface08> Wedge's characterization still sucks
[6:58:23] <noremac0uo> well i guess ff1 was a time travel plot huh.
[6:58:26] <+justianxix> it was better then nothing for wedge
[6:58:31] <+NukeDaHippies> Which is VERY unlike nomura.....
[6:58:35] <SupportWriter> @cumurasame Only 1 and 8 use that as a major plot
[6:58:35] <arkv01> yeah the fleshing out of the cast's relationship is probably the best part
[6:58:36] <+OnTheDonner> Thank you Plague. Everyone else I've been watching has been creaming their pants over the ending, and I was starting to feel insane.
[6:58:40] <hcsarg1986> @examplez0 Don't worry I'm sure Genesis will show up :P
[6:58:41] <Trinity5> very linear yeagh
[6:58:43] <arkv01> even the bonding with jessie biggs and wedge
[6:58:49] <NineBall3D> BOIFU DANCE SCENE
[6:58:58] <+capykami> the orginal Midgar was also completely linear
[6:59:01] <Ryan1016> Probably linear on purpose just because the next game would be open world leaving midgar
[6:59:06] <Ophiuchas> this game took linear to a whole new level
[6:59:10] <cumurasame> @SupportWriter Defying Fate is 1, 8, 12 and 13, perhaps 10 as well? Time Travel is just 1 and 8 and now 7R
[6:59:24] <+KawaiiJetty> Well it's Midgar, can't do much about linear.
[6:59:26] <hellfirejefe> music is good
[6:59:34] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA ICE CREAM
[6:59:35] <Ophiuchas> @plagueofgripes lol
[6:59:38] <Happy_Karl> It won't die from those 1000 papercuts because of the hyper-armor.
[6:59:39] <+JamesCorck> So a bowl of ice-cream you don't wanna try.
[6:59:42] <Trinity5> that's honestly more positive than i'd thought you'd end up lol
[6:59:42] <arkv01> 9 had aliens, don't forget!
[6:59:45] <+nooseygoosey> its a microwaved donut
[6:59:47] <kiwicoffin> @cumurasame I think 10 can be included for having time ghosts of a sort
[6:59:50] <+EpicureanIguana> Ice cream glaced by Nomura's cum
[6:59:50] <+NukeDaHippies> I think 8 is all i can give it
[6:59:53] <+JamesCorck> That's pretty high, Plague.
[6:59:54] <+justianxix> The level design remembers me too much of FF13 for its own good with all its shitty hallways
[6:59:54] <Ophiuchas> 5/5 I'm just confused
[6:59:54] <valriot> "I hate it, 8.1" LUL
[7:00:00] <Ophiuchas> 5/10
[7:00:05] <+EpicureanIguana> err glazed*
[7:00:07] <+JamesCorck> I expected you to hate this a bunch more than a 8.1
[7:00:08] <cumurasame> Do you think it can be good in your opinion in the further parts?
[7:00:15] <+NukeDaHippies> It felt like nomura had very little influence on most the game....
[7:00:23] <arkv01> score almost feels too generous, but it's understandable since we'll need to judge the final product as a whole when we get our old age pensions
[7:00:31] <Sokumotanaka> @justianxix that's cause the ff13 team are the new heads of square
[7:00:33] <Trinity5> yeah, okay
[7:00:36] <Ophiuchas> I think the more you think on it you'll drop a point of two
[7:00:37] <+NukeDaHippies> I replayed on Hard and Skipped all the time ghost and sephiroth parts, and enjoyed it more
[7:00:38] <TheWe4pon> I wonder what the original remake was like before they restarted it. @plagueofgripes
[7:00:41] <kingra> Fuck the pretension ghosts
[7:00:41] <valriot> I mean its basically a sequel
[7:00:43] <law240> it's you, you're time ghost
[7:00:43] <+justianxix> The plot ghosts are stuffed in almost every important cutscene
[7:00:46] <Trinity5> wow plague you definitely could have fooled me lmfao
[7:00:49] <cumurasame> If the New Timeline was optional - would you like the game?
[7:00:55] <examplez0> I'm not angry at you Nomura, just disappointed
[7:01:04] <+PleasantLee> even for the stuff thats just directing and scenery, its all good. but not 100 what I want. like the bike reveal with cloud and some sector layouts, mostly wall market
[7:01:18] <Zohare> They didn't need to make them changing the story a whole story point
[7:01:20] <arkv01> but who do they replace him with? toriyama who made the shitshow that was 13?
[7:01:23] <valriot> Good, do something new
[7:01:25] <+PleasantLee> also the cross dressing quest is jsut a haze of blah
[7:01:25] <Ophiuchas> if they'd have said Reboot instead of Remake a lot of problems would have been fixed
[7:01:28] <+jiggy_snipe> Plague, Nojima is the writer and Toriyama is a co-director. They do stuff like this too
[7:01:33] <+PleasantLee> you just do it cause the game wants you to
[7:01:33] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Well the interesting thing is that certain things are needed for huge plot points to happen. Which are now avoided with changing "destiny". So that's somewhat interesting
[7:01:39] <Trinity5> it's definitely for people who played the original
[7:01:40] <+EpicureanIguana> the only concern here is how to tie in KH to this game
[7:01:44] <Trinity5> like what the HELL marketing
[7:01:53] <Kaede_Viz> @PlagueOfGripes now you know about the time ghost. you think they're going to "save" aeris? is that where we're going?
[7:01:54] <+thackattack00> This was my first time with FF7 and i had no idea what the fuck was going on in the final chapters
[7:02:04] <Trinity5> a joke that will be 4 hours long
[7:02:06] <kingra> @PlagueOfGripes Toriyama FUCKED third birthday with time ghosts
[7:02:11] <+justianxix> You just faught Endgame Sephiroth too
[7:02:25] <Ophiuchas> oh aeris is totally living, if they kill her what was the point of all this fighting destiny crap
[7:02:26] <Trinity5> @PlagueOfGripes oh yeah, what about the msuic
[7:02:27] <simplybumbling> We have to stop Sephiroth! ...BTW who is he?
[7:02:28] <Trinity5> music*
[7:02:31] <SnickSnack666> I think we will start part 2 with the flashback
[7:02:33] <+jiggy_snipe> the Kalm flashback isn't really important imo. The party already fought him whereas in OG, he was this mysterious legendary soldier who was thought dead
[7:02:36] <waifoong98> man can you imagine Cid reaction lol
[7:02:40] <arkv01> as bad as nomura is, the demon that is toriyama needs to be caged
[7:02:42] <+NukeDaHippies> It also establishes him as an ALLY and you got to see how scary he was oni YOUR side
[7:02:43] <penitentpentwitch> FF7R2 should start with the player controlling Sephiroth attacking a dragon.
[7:02:47] <cumurasame> @Ophiuchas To gut punch that you can't defy fate like in 15 or something
[7:03:01] <valriot> I mean they have more motivation now, everyone tagged along cos "i guess, im bored"
[7:03:08] <+NukeDaHippies> Music was alright....But most of it lacks the charm of the original
[7:03:08] <Phoenixianstyle> I forsee it's either not going to be a flashback or they'll try to use it in the original fashion of it explaining things... but who knows
[7:03:13] <Kejang> got a feeling this is gonna burn in dev hell cause the direction and no idea where to go
[7:03:14] <Darksword64> Wasn't the OG point to chase sepiroth, thats what they're doing still even after the whole time jannies shit.
[7:03:21] <+OnTheDonner> Hip-Hop-De-Chocobo is fucking abysmal
[7:03:22] <Trinity5> yeah the remix of oppressed people i can see being controversial
[7:03:30] <+jiggy_snipe> Masashi Hamauzu is a really good composer. I love the dude
[7:03:35] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Hip Hop de Chocobo?
[7:03:39] <+NukeDaHippies> The collapsed tunnel
[7:03:47] <Phoenixianstyle> that new chocobo song goes hard af you're all wrong if you disagree lol
[7:03:49] <examplez0> The collapsed tunnel area?
[7:03:53] <+OnTheDonner> the one by seventh heaven, that sounds like it's made with a fucking balloon
[7:03:57] <Trinity5> yeah the collapsed tunnel area
[7:04:00] <SupportWriter> Dude, lol, Cutscenes!
[7:04:01] <arkv01> fair, the techno shit is sometimes too far removed from the mood of the originals
[7:04:04] <Ophiuchas> my view now is: fine you wanna do this rewrite fate? fine. do it. commit no half arsing
[7:04:23] <Ophiuchas> the music was half the game in the OG
[7:04:28] <heroicspiritavenger> Honestly, they shouldn't have bothered making this as a game. They should have just made this a series of films. So they could justify their auteur bullshit, and changes.
[7:04:31] <arkv01> the moment you hit that world map and the music plays Kreygasm
[7:04:32] <+NukeDaHippies> Most of the music was unnoticable. The old shinra tower music palys when you go backwards down the floors....It's so much better
[7:04:46] <waifoong98> I feel the music is over orchestrated and some try too hip with the kids
[7:04:50] <Trinity5> thematically disconnected
[7:04:57] <Sokumotanaka> Dont insult persona like that
[7:05:02] <+PleasantLee> thank you eli
[7:05:03] <+OnTheDonner> No, give us more Plague.
[7:05:04] <Dementedpenguin> Sure.
[7:05:07] <Vaiire> You can finally rest now, Plague.
[7:05:11] <SnickSnack666> I would say if there was one think that AC did really well it was the remix of OC music
[7:05:11] <SupportWriter> @PlagueOfGripes What about dem cutscenes
[7:05:13] <mrgaster8> yes
[7:05:14] <SnickSnack666> OG*
[7:05:14] <Trinity5> yeah plague get some rest
[7:05:16] <Eger007> How about bosses?
[7:05:17] <Trinity5> or you know don't
[7:05:19] <+KongolComet> a lot of the tracks don't have the same energy either
[7:05:21] <theloganbrand> I want more monologues about dog shit
[7:05:27] <cumurasame> Do you think you could enjoy the new content done effectively?
[7:05:30] <hcsarg1986> How do you think they'll handle the other party members?
[7:05:36] <valriot> I think it depends what you wanted out of it. I dont care, old game still good, i just wanted something new
[7:05:37] <gazdropish> thanks plague. thank gid i'm not crazy
[7:05:38] <+justianxix> @PlagueOfGripes Do you think they will follow the events after Kalm at all closely?
[7:05:39] <Kampler21> are you gonna make a vid about this lol @plagueofgripes
[7:05:40] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Now do spoilercast with Pat and Woolie xD
[7:05:40] <+NukeDaHippies> My issue is this is how people will see the original......
[7:05:45] <+OnTheDonner> KH is one of their best selling franchises. Stupidity is a seller
[7:05:47] <+jiggy_snipe> so its a sequel
[7:05:52] <cerazor01> @PlagueOfGripes this is not neccessarily just a FF7R question, but would you make any changes/improvements to Sephiroth as a character?
[7:05:55] <Ryan1016> @PlagueOfGripes Do you not see this as a sequel or whatever at this point?
[7:05:58] <Sokumotanaka> Remember when Cait Sith showed up for no reason for a second?
[7:05:59] <arkv01> just no more dirge of cerberus, lord have mercy
[7:06:00] <gnollAUS> Ya did good Gripe. Got though it and are mostly sane despite the time ghosts.
[7:06:22] <Cole_PK> they didnt want to make this game an exact copy of the OG, they wanted to make it something new
[7:06:33] <+justianxix> Dude, this whole power move is SUPER ARROGANT
[7:06:37] <valriot> Well the main issue with that was the engine and thinking they could do that
[7:06:45] <Ophiuchas> i don't think it would have been the same game without it
[7:06:52] <+KawaiiJetty> Rest Plague. Also my fav remain X and XII, VII had the fun characters hoing for me
[7:06:58] <kingra> Again for the third time LUL
[7:07:03] <+PleasantLee> that makes sense, because 7 is a really janky game. and for it to be heralded as a masterpiece, yeah the would get arrogant
[7:07:08] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes That's what happens to popular things without an original author with a vision, Plague. Becaue the only langauge capitalism understands is money, and these will make money regardless of how they are written, they have no means of knowing if they have fucked up and will only fuck up further.
[7:07:08] <arkv01> LORD NO
[7:07:10] <noremac0uo> I don't get what this is, it's not a remake, it's not a reboot, it's not a remaster.
[7:07:14] <arkv01> no more dirge PLEASE
[7:07:22] <MartiusGW> square need to remake vincent phone game
[7:07:23] <SnickSnack666> I hope to god Dirge of Cerberus is a game ill never see again
[7:07:26] <cumurasame> @noremac0uo REQUEL
[7:07:30] <heroicspiritavenger> CRISIS CORE RE:RIVAL
[7:07:31] <+justianxix> Its more of an adaption
[7:07:33] <silvcrest> its a sequel
[7:07:34] <+NukeDaHippies> What i hate, is parts of this game makes you think they have. But, when it shows they haven't gives me a bad feeling in my gut
[7:07:34] <hcsarg1986> How do think they'll handle the other party members?
[7:07:34] <valriot> The writer of this game wrote the ORIGINAL, people....cmon dude
[7:07:34] <Ophiuchas> that's my worry, that they'll just rehash other games now
[7:07:35] <Sokumotanaka> Just remove the whole team and replace them with a fresh new skilled team and drop ff7r and move onto ff16
[7:07:36] <Cole_PK> Nomura didnt write the story tho
[7:07:39] <heroicspiritavenger> BEFORE CRISIS RE:CHARGED
[7:07:41] <kiwicoffin> I'm sure the FF7 Remake theme park in japan will be fantastic
[7:07:44] <SyLuX45> Fantastic more FF7 oversaturation
[7:07:49] <examplez0> Everything went downhill when The Gooch left
[7:07:49] <+jiggy_snipe> Nojima still wrote this tho lol
[7:07:55] <heroicspiritavenger> DIRGE OF CERBERUS RE:GURGITATED
[7:07:56] <availablethor> Exactly.
[7:07:58] <SyLuX45> Make something with the other FF
[7:08:00] <valriot> This is the original writer Plague LUL
[7:08:01] <cumurasame> but weren't most of the team of the original were on this one?
[7:08:03] <+NukeDaHippies> It's like the simpsons
[7:08:06] <peterthepanda115> But the team is already there minus Sakaguchi
[7:08:08] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Would you say that this should've been similar to RE2 remake, instead of some smart-ass fanfic?
[7:08:11] <valriot> IT IS THOUGH LUL
[7:08:25] <umbilicalsky9> not even fans
[7:08:29] <+PleasantLee> almost all the way through voyager, its just really average. rarely an episode where you you're like WOW
[7:08:29] <valriot> The writer has wrote all the FF7 canon since the original
[7:08:35] <Ryan1016> The only writer credited to FF7 that isn't on remake though is Sakaguchi
[7:08:39] <+justianxix> The same writers that had Titus Head blown off in a fucking novel
[7:08:45] <valriot> Sakaguchi hasnt done shit for 15 years
[7:08:49] <Dez_Rambler> With squeenix it's hard for me to think of a single game they've made that didn't go through development hell
[7:08:57] <Sokumotanaka> @cumurasame Lol no they're gone dude, this is a new team of the ff13 creators, designers etc
[7:09:04] <+samirrsp> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to FF7 remake castlesuperbeast spoilercast?
[7:09:11] <cerazor01> MM9 was made by an arrogant man
[7:09:12] <Vaiire> Your fears can only be confirmed. Japan fellates the idea of age = respect. With where Nomura sits now as being "the old guard", he ain't getting kicked off any time soon.
[7:09:18] <cerazor01> *MN9
[7:09:20] <examplez0> Are you going to buy the next episode?
[7:09:32] <Ophiuchas> @plagueofgripes will we see any FF7R art?
[7:09:35] <hcsarg1986> How do you think they'll handle the other party members?
[7:09:40] <+jiggy_snipe> Nojima is still the same writer and he wrote alot of stuff in Comp
[7:09:47] <cumurasame> Do you think the next games could surprise you positively?
[7:09:49] <cerazor01> although Megaman crashed because Capcom got so greedy that their creations started to blend together and compete.
[7:09:55] <+NukeDaHippies> Woolie has too many projects going on in his basement
[7:10:11] <availablethor> @Vaiire This stupid hit. Age was respect when surviving to an old age was an actual accomplishment in the middle ages. Now ever idiot lives o the ripe and destructive age of 90.
[7:10:19] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes To be fair, Nomura didn't do it alone, but we can't underestimate how much control jp directors have over their work...
[7:10:27] <SyLuX45> This one of the few FF were some party members are non important
[7:10:33] <valriot> Why are people ignoring that its the same writer LUL The only guy whos not on the project is Sakaguchi, but he honestly didnt do much post FF6, and left
[7:10:36] <peterthepanda115> "Scenario Write:Kazushige Nojima" Kappa Kappa
[7:10:36] <Vaiire> It's a Japanese culture thing, man.
[7:11:12] <ditrak> its easy to critizise than making a game Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[7:11:13] <%caramello_man> @valriot different director, different staff changes a lot man
[7:11:33] <+thefakeh> now that the games done, onto the more important topics: aerith/tifa lewds when
[7:11:33] <valriot> @caramello_man The producer is the old director, and producers have more control
[7:11:38] <TheWe4pon> @plagueofgripes so the Writer for this game was the writer for the KH games. and the Co director for FF7R was the designer for parasite Eve 3
[7:11:41] <ditrak> easy to talk better than making a game lul
[7:11:47] <examplez0> FF7 was a fluke in the truest sense
[7:11:53] <+EpicureanIguana> This is all just preparation for the eventual bankrupcy/disney acquisition. Gotta tie in that sweet Kingdom Hearts lore
[7:11:55] <%caramello_man> @valriot yeah that's fair
[7:11:56] <examplez0> So are you going to buy the next episode Plague?
[7:11:56] <Monstergelo> @thefakeh redxiii lewd
[7:11:57] <arkv01> in that sense I gotta respect capcom for their REmakes doing as well as they have, even if they also have flaws
[7:11:57] <+NukeDaHippies> What a piece of shit.... - AVGN
[7:12:02] <+jiggy_snipe> @TheWe4pon co-director Toriyama is Mr. FF13 :)
[7:12:07] <dmian07> Taht is exactly why is different. Remake is a subtitle, as many people are calling it now this game is a REquel
[7:12:12] <kiwicoffin> Cloud at 1 HP says it all
[7:12:13] <Ryan1016> @caramello_man Kitase was the director of 7 and is the right hand man to nomura in remake, Nomura thought Kitase was director earlier in the production cycle according to an interview
[7:12:14] <+justianxix> FF7 was a real collaboration effort
[7:12:17] <examplez0> I don't blame you
[7:12:31] <arkv01> back to the depths, ff7
[7:12:34] <Kampler21> You gonna try hard mode
[7:12:40] <+NukeDaHippies> There won't be. Too many people are letting this crap slide
[7:12:40] <+justianxix> Didn't they just release an article?
[7:12:43] <NineBall3D> nomura gets ronavirus
[7:12:45] <KaiserMario> I doubt it, they are very proud of it and are getting a lot of praise for it
[7:12:50] <Shardlab> FF& Recreation
[7:12:52] <Cole_PK> in an the interview, the direction of the game wasnt decided by one person, EVERYONE agreed to it
[7:12:55] <SeBigBoss> i mightve gone too far in a few places
[7:12:56] <SyLuX45> FF7 was popular cause it was one of the few first titles for the PS1. Hell most PS1s came with FF7
[7:13:03] <Shardlab> FF7 Recreation and Redo
[7:13:07] <MilkingEdge> NOMURA WILL GO SUPER SAIYAN
[7:13:12] <Ophiuchas> the choices have been made they have to move forward.
[7:13:25] <%caramello_man> @Ryan1016 that just makes it seem like the whole project was confused from the start
[7:13:26] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes I'll say though, the original was a lightning in a bottle. They threw every weird shit they could think of together and it just sort of worked. It might be a case of Star War 1. That's why they can't recreate it. It was never a product of an intentional application of skill.
[7:13:32] <+jiggy_snipe> @SyLuX45 also 1st FF to come out in Europe
[7:13:35] <cumurasame> Are you open to the idea it COULD be good?
[7:13:37] <arkv01> schlock, but maybe it'll be entertaining
[7:13:41] <Ophiuchas> if they backtrack I actually think it would be worse
[7:13:43] <hcsarg1986> How do you think they'll handle the other party members?
[7:13:45] <waifoong98> will there be a video?
[7:13:55] <+EpicureanIguana> more zippers, more belts, more time ghosts.
[7:14:09] <xxdragoneyesxx> wow
[7:14:10] <+jiggy_snipe> hey man Mode 7 was cool
[7:14:17] <Ryan1016> @caramello_man I mean probably they both showed it way earlier than they wanted and canned Cyberconnect2 during development and went full in house
[7:14:21] <Phoenixianstyle> I want Yuffie and Vincent to make sense in the game and not be characters lol
[7:14:28] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I'm interested to see how certain events play out now that "destiny" has changed. Certain big ones needed to happen to help with things
[7:14:28] <+crown_clown22> Im all for it and also am afraid where it can go
[7:14:51] <+jiggy_snipe> I remember talking about how great the graphics looked lol
[7:14:52] <Dementedpenguin> I remember the news actually covered the FF7 launch
[7:15:17] <arkv01> big blocky 3D
[7:15:22] <Ophiuchas> @plagueofgripes exactly that
[7:15:29] <+gothvomit_> did you see all the original FMV cutscenes from FF7 got ripped off of a DVD in surprisingly high quality? @plagueofgripes
[7:15:36] <+jiggy_snipe> only 3 FFs had came out in NA and none had come out in Europe
[7:15:40] <availablethor> So LITERALLY Star Wars? It was a technical marvel?
[7:15:57] <KaiserMario> The west had only got 1,4 and 6
[7:16:06] <+KawaiiJetty> From 7 it spread better. I still have my og copies of 7 and 8
[7:16:23] <Ryan1016> Peak viewership hours
[7:16:40] <$doomp12> just like star wars, it was Purdy and was revolutionary for its time
[7:16:49] <+KawaiiJetty> My dad even bought a statue of Cloud with his motorcycle
[7:16:57] <+jiggy_snipe> 6 is too low
[7:17:12] <arkv01> 7-8ish
[7:17:14] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Like if there was a Tri-Fusion of Tifa, Aerith and Jessie, it'd blow up! lol
[7:17:31] <dmian07> A lot of newcomers love it. So nostalgia is not really what makes it
[7:17:34] <+jiggy_snipe> i think 8 is very fair maybe 9.
[7:17:43] <examplez0> I'd give it a 7
[7:17:44] <+justianxix> I wish I could forget this
[7:17:44] <Ryan1016> Man you haven't seen the discourse then apparently
[7:17:52] <Kyni> weil on a nor,mal 1 to 10 scale a 6 would be above average, but we are talking video game scales^^
[7:17:53] <examplez0> 3 points off because of Nomura bullshit
[7:17:58] <+PleasantLee> I'm hoping the pc version will be heavily moddable
[7:17:59] <yreva777> Agreed
[7:18:01] <arkv01> 9 would be judging it purely from a visual standard
[7:18:02] <cumurasame> You don't think the game will be so controversial it'll stay?
[7:18:04] <availablethor> What if they asked Nomura to fuck it up so it'd be remembered for that? Because negative press is press too.
[7:18:12] <+crown_clown22> 9/10 for me its has its flaws
[7:18:20] <examplez0> FF7 OG was a better game for its time than FF7 R was for its time
[7:18:24] <Vaiire> Did you clap when you saw it?
[7:18:25] <+EpicureanIguana> well, it is a remake. It was always going to rely heavily on nostalgia
[7:18:27] <Ophiuchas> 5/10 for me I'm nuetral
[7:18:31] <hcsarg1986> What do you think they'll do with the other party members?
[7:18:32] <Tikigod784> clap
[7:18:33] <+justianxix> Would rather they focus on FF16
[7:18:34] <+PleasantLee> I agree 7 was a better game for its release time, but I think thats unfair for 7r because games in general are more competent now
[7:18:34] <MilkingEdge> PLAY THE ORIGINAL PLAGUE
[7:18:36] <arkv01> I got the biggest hardon to replay the original now
[7:18:39] <Ryan1016> @PlagueOfGripes Do you not see this as a sequel or whatever at this point?
[7:18:40] <%caramello_man> well done eli, have a good one!
[7:18:41] <examplez0> I'm gonna wait out the sequel
[7:18:43] <gazdropish> thanks plague
[7:18:47] <+terry_quest> 9 for me loved it and embrace the way its going
[7:18:48] <+jiggy_snipe> i think they did a good job on the battle system tbh. if they are gonna make FFs real time, this is the way to do it not FF15
[7:18:51] <+NukeDaHippies> I keep telling people that it doesn't pander to new comers.
[7:18:52] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> thanks for streaming plague
[7:18:54] <umbilicalsky9> wow chapter selection
[7:18:55] <Kampler21> you gonna make a video out of this @plagueofgripes
[7:18:56] <SupportWriter> What you think about the cutscenes
[7:18:56] <+terry_quest> i didnt expect a faithful remake
[7:18:56] <+Slaardacity> tifa best girls?
[7:18:59] <+DiabloDeAzul> If everything is the same but the time jannies were gone, would it be better?
[7:18:59] <examplez0> How would you rank the FF games you've played?
[7:19:03] <majeser> thanks for streaming
[7:19:05] <+EpicureanIguana> thanks for playing this through to the end on stream SeemsGood
[7:19:08] <arkv01> I think we all want to thank you for the earnest and genuine commentary during this playthrough instead of the usual fellating among all the other streamers
[7:19:09] <tolloponik> if you wanna keep playing this save befor you close it or you'll have to do all that again
[7:19:10] <%LordSDB> Thanks for Streaming dude!
[7:19:11] <availablethor> best girl was clearly Cloud
[7:19:18] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> its a game that demonstrates that nomura should be banned for anything that isnt kingdom hearts
[7:19:29] <SeBigBoss> "oh look, is that the script?" will always be my favorite
[7:19:30] <MilkingEdge> ITS ALL NOMURA
[7:19:38] <cumurasame> I enjoy the game for what it is rather than what it isn't. I do find the lying was dumb and kinda malicious but I have faith it can be great
[7:19:39] <examplez0> Nojima
[7:19:47] <+NukeDaHippies> I'm not a fan of the idea that, people will let this game paint the OG as a nomura like game
[7:19:53] <+jiggy_snipe> idk Plague, Nojima's credits are kinda wacky lol
[7:19:57] <+justianxix> What do you think it would take to have a game that affects the industry and people FF7 did?
[7:20:01] <DaddyVamp777> I still have my original FFVII Ps1 cds and the memory card
[7:20:04] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I think that if their intention was to go into a remaking of the original story, instead of a remaking of the game, they should've been more blatant about it...
[7:20:07] <+jiggy_snipe> FF7, FF8, FF10, FF10-2, KH lol
[7:20:08] <Sokumotanaka> I'm still not certain what the whole zack thing's about
[7:20:23] <cerazor01> yay my question
[7:20:26] <Trinity5> you don't know why sephiroth is so bad, not really
[7:20:30] <Sokumotanaka> Eh ff7 is also overhyped the ff7 fans tend to get overaggressive over what your favorite is, this it has no flaws. If people asked for suggestions it's always 7 despite their being other great ff titles like again 6 or 9 are but that's my opinion.
[7:20:30] <theloganbrand> why was sephiroth even in this game
[7:20:31] <arkv01> I think most of our original 7 CDs are dead from CD rot though
[7:20:33] <hcsarg1986> What do you think they'll do with the other party members?
[7:20:33] <+NukeDaHippies> Sephiroth is the one character thats simply wrong
[7:20:43] <Trinity5> dude WHY was sephiroth in this game at alllll
[7:20:47] <+justianxix> I wish he had an actual character
[7:20:47] <waifoong98> @theloganbrand brand recognition lol
[7:20:51] <Kyni> Oddly enough i think a lot about how this game will be remembered depends ons the next part. If the Story of teh next part blows, people will look back on this ending as the point where it all went wrong.
[7:20:53] <+EpicureanIguana> that Sephiroth is KH Sephiroth. There is no other rendition with the dumbass wing. That's Nomura's baby
[7:21:09] <+NukeDaHippies> weapon
[7:21:10] <gunsrlove> Never played the original. This one seems like a decent 7/10 with good animations, big budget and some decent moments. At the end I had no idea what anyone was doing over nonsense dialogue.
[7:21:13] <gazdropish> @sokumotanaka you have no idea what you're talking about
[7:21:15] <Bustahhwulf> FF highlander Kappa
[7:21:17] <Eger007> property
[7:21:23] <KaiserMario> He was Raiden from MGS2
[7:21:27] <+jiggy_snipe> I always loved Sephiroth's characterizaion for flashbacks
[7:21:32] <arkv01> yeah that was the most sympathizable part of sephiroth's character and now we have this
[7:21:32] <Apolonm> Homelander Sepiroth
[7:21:36] <availablethor> so Homelander
[7:21:38] <+PleasantLee> even in universe of 7 sephiroth is famous for being famous
[7:21:42] <Bustahhwulf> homelander* whoops
[7:21:51] <Ophiuchas> sephiroth is one step away from levitating and spewing vomit whilst his head spins. I just can't take him seriously in this one
[7:21:56] <Sokumotanaka> @gazdropish ask me if I care the answer may surprise you.
[7:22:04] <Zohare> @EpicureanIguana The wing is in both Crisis Core and Advent Children
[7:22:06] <NineBall3D> Sephiroth=Albert wesker
[7:22:11] <+jiggy_snipe> THE CHOSEN ONE
[7:22:15] <+AgroHatesWater> I agree but you cant fit that into Midgar, I woulld hope to see that for sure in the next or so parts since they did set him up as a DV as you say.
[7:22:15] <Coffee_JD> nah hes a time travelling, dimension hopping wizard with a black wing who goes on trips to the edge of creation
[7:22:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I like that it is now part of Sephiroths character that his motivation is maybe not even to really win, so long as he doesn't get fuckassed like before
[7:22:18] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> I hope we see more of that in the sequel, especially now that all the chars know of him but nothing else
[7:22:18] <+KawaiiJetty> Yeah then Jenova fell apart
[7:22:28] <Vicker9192> hi chat, just opened the stream? has Plague finished it yet?
[7:22:35] <waifoong98> @Vicker9192 yes
[7:22:37] <Sir__Nova> Going by the flashback, it's implied he was a real good guy before going insane.
[7:22:54] <Vicker9192> damn, I missed the start of his post game thoughts then
[7:22:54] <arkv01> we saw glimpses of pre-insanity sephiroth in crisis core and that was actually really cool
[7:22:55] <availablethor> Wesker might be another example of a japanese property doing this aizenification to their villain.
[7:22:55] <Kampler21> Are you gonna make a video out of this @plagueofgripes
[7:22:56] <KaiserMario> They turned him into Aizen
[7:22:59] <dmian07> We have not seen Sephiroths backstory in remake yet tho
[7:23:01] <+justianxix> Sephroth wasn't ever the greatest villian, but he had something at least. Not now
[7:23:02] <+jiggy_snipe> at worst he was a little cold in the past
[7:23:05] <+NukeDaHippies> Sephiroth doesn't even know who cloud is, for the most part of ff7
[7:23:16] <Ophiuchas> sephiroth always felt different like he didn't fit in, he was also an outsider
[7:23:23] <Sokumotanaka> They were never gonna make him tragic it's ff7 they failed that in the og they failed it here
[7:23:28] <availablethor> @KaiserMario Is there an even older example of it than Aizen?
[7:23:36] <majeser> making the original ending bad seems a bit weird.
[7:23:39] <tolloponik> @PlagueOfGripes if your gonna play more of it offline then save on this screen or else your gonna have to do all of that again
[7:23:41] <arkv01> time for remake of 8!
[7:23:51] <+therawk> early riser plague?
[7:23:51] <+gothvomit_> there’s shit going around that alludes to Sephiroth’s seven seconds to the end line being about the time it takes in the original to descend and kill Aerith
[7:23:57] <availablethor> an 8 remake would be fine because it's already timefuckery
[7:23:58] <+gothvomit_> which is exactly seven seconds
[7:24:00] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> They soft rebooted it
[7:24:02] <+jiggy_snipe> it expanded for better and padded some things that ran a little long
[7:24:03] <+crown_clown22> Its a requel, remake-sequel
[7:24:04] <+gothvomit_> thought it was neat
[7:24:05] <+EpicureanIguana> Advent Children was directed by Nomura lads, winged Sepiroth is Nomura's child
[7:24:11] <Eger007> go to CBS next week @PlagueOfGripes
[7:24:11] <arkv01> how many entries in the series can we fuck over until the fans come burn out HQ down, heheh!
[7:24:13] <+jiggy_snipe> Sequel Reboot
[7:24:15] <%caramello_man> plagueChirei plagueChirei plagueChirei
[7:24:16] <KaiserMario> @availablethor Oh there are plenty, some even more accurate... but Aizen is iconic
[7:24:16] <+NukeDaHippies> Like the plate dropping? And pretty much everyone living? what a tragedy.......
[7:24:22] <Vicker9192> has Plague mentioned whether or not he trusts the writers on the plot of the next sequels?
[7:24:25] <Trinity5> I'm having a fun time
[7:24:26] <ditrak> u suck dude u talking too much critizise too much
[7:24:29] <Trinity5> honestly
[7:24:29] <Ryan1016> Hard mode isn't too bad
[7:24:31] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> @plagueofgripes do you think they'll save aerith and zack?
[7:24:43] <Trinity5> you can't use ethers
[7:24:43] <ditrak> im leaving ur logical dumb mind here

[7:25:57] <KaiserMario> DO IT
[7:25:57] <SnickSnack666> The Hard mode was actully kind fun
[7:25:58] <+DiabloDeAzul> Thanks UE4!
[7:26:01] <examplez0> You should play OG FF7 so you can feel good about FF7 again
[7:26:03] <+jiggy_snipe> well im hoping the next part isn't chapter based or too cutoff
[7:26:03] <DensityD> more rocks
[7:26:09] <waifoong98> lol
[7:26:09] <Happy_Karl> Let's stare at more bricks, yes.
[7:26:11] <Trinity5> LUL
[7:26:11] <+justianxix> LUL
[7:26:12] <+jiggy_snipe> OG Midgar was linear too
[7:26:15] <+JamesCorck> we're never going to get to the fireworks factory
[7:26:21] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes HHave you ever played Dragons Dogma?
[7:26:28] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes Do you thikn they'l lever make the next one open world, or will they streamline it?
[7:26:37] <examplez0> How would you rank the FF games you've played?
[7:26:44] <+DiabloDeAzul> Max dood already did and he loves it
[7:26:51] <Sokumotanaka> Just replay OG FF7
[7:26:57] <+britishmarsh> Hey Plague, looking good, hey chat !
[7:27:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> OG midgar was literally nothing but hallways
[7:27:03] <GilliamYaeger> FF7 is easier to mod than ever
[7:27:03] <TheWe4pon> 76hrs total
[7:27:06] <Kampler21> @plagueofgripes are you gonna make a video of out this
[7:27:07] <+jiggy_snipe> yea but FF15 showed they can open stuff
[7:27:09] <GilliamYaeger> So best time to play it is now
[7:27:11] <+NukeDaHippies> It's a waste of potential, and that's the real shame
[7:27:13] <gonzalogp98> i wouldnt take max's opinion as subjective tbh
[7:27:15] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes That's my issue. I think they next one will just be city to city. Not even a world map.
[7:27:16] <Ophiuchas> og 7 replay 👍
[7:27:23] <%caramello_man> @PlagueOfGripes do you think a lot of people will replay this game? Pr is this one of those 1 and done deals?
[7:27:28] <SnickSnack666> I platinum in the same time as you beat the game lol
[7:27:29] <arkv01> you can never leave LUL
[7:27:31] <Vicker9192> @PlagueOfGripes I don't know if you've said your thoughts on this yet, but do you think that SE writers will be able to come up with a good sequel for this?
[7:27:32] <gnollAUS> Dragons dogma is good
[7:27:41] <+crown_clown22> Midgar section was a hallway tho
[7:27:41] <SupportWriter> Max is a game equivalent of a corporate tool
[7:27:43] <+justianxix> OG Midgar was just screens, open screens that allowed you to go places that weren't progression
[7:27:52] <arkv01> plague will you be uploading this to youtube?
[7:28:01] <+bear_breaker20> dragons dogma's got problems but its open for sure
[7:28:04] <medril07> to be fair, it's a remake and not a remaster
[7:28:07] <Trinity5> idk I thought your list of stuff at the end was reasonable and we'll thought out
[7:28:09] <+OldWorldFool> I have never played FF7 :)
[7:28:22] <DensityD> frothing is my fetish, it comes through Kreygasm
[7:28:25] <BlackSunBlood> Make Final Fantasy Great Again
[7:28:25] <+gothvomit_> i mean the game’s got problems, but i still liked it and i’m interested in seeing where it goes
[7:28:25] <%CyberDingus> Same for Killary tbh
[7:28:35] <+terry_quest> @SupportWriter what does that even mean he enjoyed the game for what it was and got into detail after beating it
[7:28:36] <+jiggy_snipe> I will be highly disappointed if they don't take FF15 cues and recreate an open world for the next part
[7:28:37] <medril07> smelling their hair
[7:28:37] <fluffy_sauce> lol
[7:28:38] <Trinity5> I take that plague isn't voting in the election Kappa
[7:28:41] <arkv01> american boomer politics
[7:28:41] <+NukeDaHippies> I'm sick of hearing the "it's a remake not a remaster". Thats not the issue. The bad writing is the biggest problem
[7:28:46] <yreva777> Alot of what you said is valid though
[7:28:49] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I'd rather argue about the ending than over best girl
[7:28:51] <Sokumotanaka> Since my family is black we;d beg to differ
[7:28:55] <TheWe4pon> when I talked about writers I meant crap all around.
[7:29:02] <arkv01> tribal as hell
[7:29:10] <arkv01> live and die by the tribe
[7:29:12] <+bear_breaker20> i dont think anyones on nomura's side with this one lol
[7:29:15] <Sokumotanaka> fuck trump
[7:29:16] <+JamesCorck> that's called the Yahztee Crossaw effect.
[7:29:18] <+PleasantLee> you make that video for hte views
[7:29:20] <examplez0> Zidane Tribalism
[7:29:20] <+PleasantLee> IMAGINE THE VIEWS
[7:29:21] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Join the spoilercast maybe?
[7:29:22] <Trinity5> you would be surprised @bear_breaker20
[7:29:22] <%caramello_man> eli you're a good boy plagueChirei
[7:29:26] <examplez0> How would you rank the FF games you've played?
[7:29:26] <+PleasantLee> dozens of thousands
[7:29:31] <cerazor01> but that's every era
[7:29:32] <gonzalogp98> it can also be the danganronpa effect
[7:29:32] <+jiggy_snipe> @NukeDaHippies yea especially when other remakes generally don't make wild changes, see FF3, FF4, RE, Twin Snakes etc.
[7:29:33] <Trinity5> gnight plague
[7:29:37] <Fenlig> Another Dark souls LP :D
[7:29:37] <Vaiire> Get some rest.
[7:29:39] <waifoong98> that's all, take a rest
[7:29:40] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[7:29:46] <arkv01> thank you bestest boy plague
[7:29:46] <gonzalogp98> where some people pretend they like a franchise
[7:29:47] <+PleasantLee> thanks for the good times Eli
[7:29:48] <SupportWriter> @terry_quest Max is a game of a week dude that will drop a game as quickly as it loses air and wow unless he gets something out of it like his time with killer instinct
[7:29:51] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> night eli
[7:29:51] <cerazor01> it would get views because of how angry it would make people
[7:29:52] <+JamesCorck> Draw more Freya stuff Plague 8 |
[7:29:52] <Sokumotanaka> Go replay FF7 OG
[7:29:55] <gonzalogp98> just because they like one character
[7:30:00] <DirErmine> 5 raiders from DirErmine have joined! 
[7:30:01] <+JamesCorck> also get some sleep too
[7:30:02] <+PleasantLee> you have to chapter select I think
[7:30:02] <Ophiuchas> @plagueofgripes thanks for the play through
[7:30:04] <Ryan1016> It loads you back into the menu until you pick a chapter
[7:30:20] <%LordSDB> Will you be streaming any other game in the future?
[7:30:20] <cerazor01> Max was crying during the finale
[7:30:21] <+terry_quest> ok sure i let you think that
[7:30:26] <waifoong98> a whopping 1 hp
[7:30:29] <SnickSnack666> They should have just added the VR missions on the menu after beating the game
[7:30:33] <DirErmine> Heeey there, You're most welcome my dude, how are you this day?
[7:30:37] <medril07> does the colleseum have new stuff?
[7:30:39] <+crown_clown22> Complaining is all i hear omg
[7:30:42] <CheyMix> yo!
[7:30:52] <examplez0> That's exactly what happened
[7:30:53] <+britishmarsh> At least we got quality models of Tifa and Aerith
[7:30:54] <Trinity5> I mean the cyberconnect game looked kinda ass
[7:30:56] <+NukeDaHippies> He was crying......I couldn't understand. his entire chat was getting hype for the nonsensical sephiroth fight....
[7:30:59] <+justianxix> Cyper connect gameplay isn't the greatest, probably something with that
[7:30:59] <TheWe4pon> I wanna see cyberconnects version
[7:31:00] <Whyverns> cyberconnect is trash so I doubt it
[7:31:10] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Would you be this annoyed with the story if it was named Re: FF7?
[7:31:12] <%LordSDB> Cyberconnect games are pretty, but gameplay can be pretty bad
[7:31:23] <arkv01> gnight! Uh, morning, but rest well!
[7:31:27] <xhell_box> Your the first person I seen to have so much negative stuff to say about this game
[7:31:35] <+PleasantLee> speedruns are fun, GDQ are assholes
[7:31:36] <Ophiuchas> GN all
[7:31:36] <Kampler21> imagine a ff7r speedrun
[7:31:37] <+EpicureanIguana> gnight man, have fun Nomura dreams
[7:31:37] <CheyMix> oh....welp
[7:31:38] <+NukeDaHippies> i do too, is the big event actually on?
[7:31:45] <DensityD> thanks for streaming plague, bye bye
[7:31:51] <gonzalogp98> what baffles me about max is that he's like HURR DURR ANIME but since this is FF7 he goes WOOO THAT'S COOL
[7:31:54] <Whyverns> the best thing this game did was give us better models for 3d porn
[7:31:59] <Bustahhwulf> lied like kojima and mgs2 LUL
[7:31:59] <Vicker9192> yeah, that's what I'm upset about
[7:32:16] <examplez0> The most hurtful thing is that they will get away with it because Final Fantasy fans are consoomers
[7:32:17] <+NukeDaHippies> The DEMO was a 1:1 recreation of the bombing run. They advertised this falsely
[7:32:23] <+DiabloDeAzul> And we thought them editing the Don Corneo arc was the worst part :)
[7:32:24] <DensityD> t teeth of a liar
[7:32:25] <Ophiuchas> omg so I didn't imagine them saying that!
[7:32:32] <examplez0> See you later
[7:32:34] <DensityD> taste of a liar
[7:32:34] <Trinity5> later bossman
[7:32:36] <+jiggy_snipe> they also said this would a good thing for newcomers to experience FF7 but I think newcomers should still play the OG to feel the impact of alot moments
[7:32:37] <%caramello_man> @Whyverns Kreygasm Kreygasm
[7:32:38] <Dementedpenguin> Bye.
[7:32:39] <waifoong98> alright laters
[7:32:40] <Trinity5> damn he admitted it
[7:32:41] <xhell_box> Oh your name is PlagueOfGripes I get it now it’s your gimmick
[7:32:42] <KaiserMario> Good night and good job!
[7:32:42] <+PleasantLee> draw red xiii's mate
[7:32:45] <Fenlig> Byeeee
[7:32:46] <gonzalogp98> byee
