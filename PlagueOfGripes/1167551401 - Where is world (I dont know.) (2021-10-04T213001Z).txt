[0:12:24] <cap_bon> so old :(
[0:12:39] <%boatzndhoez> You need to move , you do deserve a normal internet before we all die
[0:12:52] <JimmyRuss> flashbacks to 2003 and a shared dialup for the house
[0:13:02] <+Camrinin> I learned about bag phones from Yakuza 0
[0:13:03] <%Samex_Comex> My Aunt had a car phone
[0:13:15] <%Mizaiya> Money changes everything~
[0:13:19] <%boatzndhoez> I hear you, I've been having the same problem
[0:13:22] <+Mekhet09> Yeah probably.
[0:13:41] <%Heart0fInk> i forgot about bag phones
[0:13:45] <DJDontPanic> i can't wait to finally get out of college and the recession hits again -_-
[0:13:45] <cap_bon> whhaaa you dont wanna permanently rent for the rest of your life and never own anything
[0:13:50] <+Mekhet09> "Corporations" You mean hedgefunds.
[0:14:10] <%Samex_Comex> Are houses the new stock market?
[0:14:17] <verseon1> they sadly want a renters society
[0:14:28] <The_Slag_Bag> This lowfi music fits with the pitter patter of the rain outside
[0:14:33] <%Heart0fInk> @Samex_Comex they always have been
[0:14:44] <%Bigchill___> Plague time

[0:14:58] <%PleasantLee> economy go brrrrrrr right now though...right?
[0:15:02] <%saw6boy> Hey plague, how're ya today?
[0:15:07] <%Heart0fInk> income will never go up.
[0:15:26] <%boatzndhoez> Yeah we might go to war
[0:15:36] <verseon1> issues is putting it lightly
[0:15:53] <cap_bon> Is it true that minimum wage isnt enough to even rent anywhere in the states
[0:16:04] <%Mailboy> some places
[0:16:04] <+Mekhet09> Haven't they just wasted a shitload of money making homes no one uses?
[0:16:08] <acridpaladin> the tofu dreg stuff isnt helping either
[0:16:47] <The_Slag_Bag> Didn’t Japan do something with real estate that messed them over in the 80-90s
[0:16:58] <%silvery_cricket> A bunch of money is connected that really shouldnt be
[0:16:58] <%PleasantLee> and to top it all off, you cant get the M1 app in UK
[0:17:03] <+Mekhet09> Don't worry the invisible hand of the free market will provide.
[0:17:20] <Fenlig> Just learn how to clean water SeemsGood

[0:17:53] <The_Slag_Bag> Kitty!
[0:18:00] <%Heart0fInk> sounds fine
[0:18:06] <Jetsfantasy> Until the "american dream" thing happened
[0:18:13] <%PleasantLee> until boomers got their 2nd homes
[0:18:25] <Totalabyss> oh shit i forgot plague had a vtuber avatar lol. nice
[0:19:10] <+Leodude> Did he say Zone?
[0:19:15] <%KellBeII> so like a smaller house on a larger property?
[0:19:39] <Totalabyss> its a price drop on the land not the house
[0:19:40] <%Mizaiya> Its not ugly it just has alot of character
[0:19:44] <Dalek_V> speaking of housing lol
[0:19:44] <Fenlig> Im sure its got a beautiful personality
[0:20:02] <+Mekhet09> Have you ever tried getting a bad house but negotiating for much much low.

[0:20:33] <%Heart0fInk> @Fenlig LMAO!! good joke
[0:20:38] <Totalabyss> 115k is nice and cheap
[0:21:02] <+daveronald> they live there ironically
[0:21:02] <scott_greatest> I like how your vtuber avatar captures your weeryness towards life
[0:21:03] <%silvery_cricket> Is Survival really living?
[0:21:04] <+Mekhet09> Do you need 3 bedrooms?
[0:21:16] <JimmyRuss> Me in BC seeing 400sqft apartments going for 300k CAD
[0:21:19] <Julkson> hello
[0:21:26] <Dalek_V> hope you dont have trees around if trying for starlink
[0:21:30] <Totalabyss> no in bc its over 2 mill for 300 SF
[0:21:35] <%PleasantLee> build a house on a patch of land a live there until someone from the government says to leave
[0:21:41] <Totalabyss> near vancouver
[0:21:47] <scott_greatest> There needs to be an HGTV show for finding dirt cheap horrible places to live
[0:21:58] <Jetsfantasy> Mine got delayed until next year. Ended up just getting a 5G router and adding an unlimited plan instead
[0:22:03] <verseon1> wood is expensive
[0:22:05] <+polypolipauli> They are better people though
[0:22:07] <Fenlig> I did it in minecraft seemed pretty easy
[0:22:10] <+daveronald> lumber is crazy, but going down
[0:22:17] <Julkson> Youtube started recommending me videos of muscular anime girls and I blame you
[0:22:17] <+Milo_san> Elon musk is buying my shitty town piece by piece
[0:22:18] <cap_bon> How long do shipping containers even last
[0:22:19] <%Heart0fInk> Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat? Silicone valley has the new tech and no one else? Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[0:22:22] <scott_greatest> Forgive me if this is getting too personal but does your family own your farm land?
[0:22:32] <%Samex_Comex> Meat house
[0:22:34] <cap_bon> 3 bedrooms* except two of the bedrooms are actually 1 bedroom with a wall added
[0:22:47] <Totalabyss> buy a tent live on the land steal mcdonalds wifi. Be a man!
[0:22:50] <+Kenzo2000> Builders are powered by meat
[0:22:56] <verseon1> beautiful
[0:22:56] <%JailShmixRemix> it was a pretty good segway
[0:22:57] <Sal0k> We live in the worst timeline
[0:23:15] <vonmaultke> a defacto meat monopoly?
[0:23:16] <flangodferny> Hello Plague, just stopping by to say hello. Have a nice day
[0:23:18] <+NekoStar> segue
[0:23:20] <+Mekhet09> Meat's expensive because a bunch of people got sick and forced shutdowns.
[0:23:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Seguey
[0:23:41] <%boatzndhoez> it does
[0:23:42] <%PleasantLee> I watched a show on netflix last year about nice unique homes being made. after ahile I was just disgusted by the wealth these people clearly had to rent a crane to lift a piano into their 2 floors apartment on top of a building
[0:23:48] <cap_bon> also who the fuck wants to work in a meat factory when you can do minimum wage literally anywhere else LUL
[0:23:49] <vonmaultke> we have the same thing with super markets, food prices are going crazy right now
[0:24:19] <%Samex_Comex> Neo USA
[0:24:19] <%PleasantLee> go by colour of signs like license plates and stuff
[0:24:20] <%boatzndhoez> you have to get as close as possible to the picture
[0:24:20] <Ghastlygrapher> and america makes two!
[0:24:22] <%boatzndhoez> yeah its ez
[0:24:25] <christmasinnormandy> united states 2
[0:24:42] <Julkson> Because they must always be better than everyone else
[0:24:44] <%Samex_Comex> Upside down USA
[0:24:59] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Stream dying for everyone?
[0:25:06] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Yep, noticed.
[0:25:12] <JovianGargoyle> Just for a sec
[0:25:29] <scott_greatest> There's an apple+ Show about homes like that, most of the episodes were about crazy european homes with things like greenhouses in treetops but one episode was about this Hong Kong architect who specializes in making modular small spaces, that one was actually good
[0:25:36] <christmasinnormandy> priorities for an empire
[0:25:42] <Totalabyss> usa is hundreds of tillions in dept suprised they can aford anything
[0:25:47] <scott_greatest> Lots of sliding panels to make the most of the space
[0:25:51] <%Mizaiya> We cant put fiber in the ground i need it for my poopies
[0:25:53] <Sal0k> "afford" doesn't mean "waste money in"
[0:26:00] <Jetsfantasy> It's been fine for me
[0:26:02] <cap_bon> Hey now the fiber was paid for! its jsut that ISP took the money and didnt put anything down LUL
[0:26:14] <+Mekhet09> @Totalabyss Literally every major country is in debt right now. We
[0:26:16] <%PleasantLee> but guuuuys, the bdget for the military was only 686 billion last year
[0:26:19] <doc_branny> It’s okay, I also live in nowhere America. I feel your pain
[0:26:26] <+Mekhet09> 've literally have all always been in debt.
[0:26:33] <Jetsfantasy> You've dropped practically no frames according to my end
[0:26:34] <+Mekhet09> for the last 20+ years.
[0:26:37] <%KellBeII> used to do that a lot in high school
[0:26:42] <Coystick> As long as I'm near water, I'm pretty happy
[0:26:43] <scott_greatest> Just tell the bank that you were the one that came up with the worldwide trifusion art meme
[0:26:45] <%KellBeII> needs to be cold
[0:26:48] <Coystick> Must look at water
[0:26:51] <%Samex_Comex> I would do that with Google maps
[0:26:55] <Ashboldt> Welcome to Colorado, Plague
[0:27:04] <%boatzndhoez> you need a city-town hybrid :D
[0:27:33] <cap_bon> Frame-chan is a cruel mistress
[0:27:36] <Totalabyss> lol the car killed my internet
[0:27:45] <Ashboldt> Tree limbs drive like assholes
[0:27:49] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> 'Murrakan internet is bad because the Government created an oligopoly with the few providers that already existed. This is what the government does, like with NY's metropolitan system (the stuff for trains): there were private competitors, the Gov tried to get in with their "moves", failed and basically stole the business from the privates by making it illegal to dare to say "no screw you this is my tunnel!".
[0:28:06] <scott_greatest> Those low population towns in the italy countryside seem really cool
[0:28:25] <Coystick> Move next door to P&P, be their inverted Kramer.
[0:28:35] <Ashboldt> None of this is wrong
[0:28:46] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> @scott_greatest I live in Trieste. The old, max 8 stories buildings are nice. The newer, giant ones are a punch in the eye.
[0:28:49] <+polypolipauli> Didn't used to be this way
[0:29:01] <+polypolipauli> Our state government is stupid (CA)
[0:29:04] <%Heart0fInk> "whenever California is burning" so like once a year?
[0:29:08] <Dalek_V> how do those work?
[0:29:12] <Totalabyss> Canada where the internet is good and the housing is expensive unless you want to move out side of the major citysd.
[0:29:30] <%GardenHills> I'm in Cali, it does indeed burn and smell burnt
[0:29:35] <cap_bon> there goes frame chan
[0:30:07] <%boatzndhoez> You heard Facebook and Gmail and shit are down?
[0:30:14] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Isn't California the country where a earthquake basically slurped a river underground and desertified everything?
[0:30:26] <Sal0k> Too late I have this image in my head now, why are you like this, plague ?
[0:30:35] <Totalabyss> cali will stop burning soon, All the trees will be gone and nothing left to burn
[0:30:37] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> My retinas got jumpscared by white pixels.
[0:30:40] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> I'm blind.
[0:30:55] <JovianGargoyle> Not just down but huge chunks of data are just gone.
[0:31:33] <scott_greatest> @scott_greatest I do hope that those programs succeed. Both Japan and Italy have those aging population towns and there's so many people elsewhere who can't afford to live where they are but could rebuild the community
[0:31:33] <cap_bon> Good
[0:31:57] <cap_bon> let facebook burn
[0:32:23] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> internet ded
[0:32:50] <%Samex_Comex> Lather rinse repeat, always repeat
[0:33:07] <+tussletoes> zucc got him.
[0:33:11] <Fenlig> Must have been a really big squirrel
[0:33:14] <%FingaLights> Huh, I wonder if that's why my Oculus wasn't showing any apps
[0:33:23] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Maccaroni Zuccemberg.
[0:33:31] <%JailShmixRemix> F
[0:33:33] <+daveronald> did he poop on the antenna?
[0:33:40] <Totalabyss> he had to go ouside and move a cow away from his internet signal
[0:33:45] <%KellBeII> the antenna pooped on eli
[0:33:49] <cap_bon> what happens if facebook just decides oneday to say fuck the oculus does it just become a brick
[0:34:15] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> @cap_bon Basically.
[0:34:33] <%FingaLights> There are probably ways to still use it as a PC vr head set
[0:34:46] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Meanwhile the IBM office PC that I got for €15 with windows XP still works and I can casually play WINquake on it XD
[0:34:47] <cap_bon> I sure love the future were we own nothing
[0:35:04] <~PlagueOfGripes> will return once ISP is done recycling
[0:35:50] <Jetsfantasy> We're back
[0:36:18] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Mildred crashed the internet.
[0:36:19] <%silvery_cricket> Jimmy Comcast
[0:36:44] <~PlagueOfGripes> isp still doing its thing
[0:36:49] <cap_bon> need a really long stick so you can just poke the guy running the isp
[0:37:28] <%IsaacClarkeANCAP> Oligopoly = no need to compete = shizen service but you're forces to chose one of us so pay XD
[0:37:34] <~PlagueOfGripes> isp guy is basically running tests because the connection was unstable
[0:37:56] <The_Slag_Bag> Aww man
