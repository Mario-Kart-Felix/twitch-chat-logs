[0:08:19] <%PleasantLee> could use a 10minutemail
[0:09:49] <Totalabyss> 80 dollar gaming keyboard with rgb controlers = LIGHT SHOW
[0:09:53] <%boatzndhoez> Sorry I meant how many slots are you allowed :D
[0:09:59] <Panopticon01> Cheer500 Hey plague, love your work, has the lure of the success of your previous animations ever led you to make a decision you think ever violated your artistic integrity in order to attract more of an audience or do you think you've stayed true to your self in your works?
[0:10:10] <%Samex_Comex> You only get one free jerk
[0:11:00] <Totalabyss> whats that smell? oh its blood~~
[0:11:02] <The_Slag_Bag> What the fuck is integrity
[0:11:34] <Totalabyss> north korea
[0:11:47] <jackmcslay> Definitely korean writing
[0:11:47] <Dalek_V> s korea
[0:11:50] <%PleasantLee> korea, famouse for its little orange seats in brick huts
[0:11:54] <Ariddic> few mountains, just hills
[0:12:05] <Panopticon01> that could be literally ANYWHERE in rural south korea... jfc
[0:12:06] <%Samex_Comex> Bus stop cubby
[0:12:15] <Coystick> Chyna
[0:12:21] <countyarc216> Gobi Desert?
[0:12:35] <%boatzndhoez> you gotta guess :D
[0:12:42] <Panopticon01> Thats korean writing!
[0:12:44] <ghekre> korea
[0:12:48] <+ThomasOfTroy> The characters look korean
[0:12:48] <%Mizaiya> Florida
[0:12:51] <+polypolipauli> Circles = Korean
[0:12:53] <Vlad_Tech> Greetings Plague, how goes the stalker simulator?
[0:13:05] <Fenlig> Definitely Korea, their characters have the circles in them
[0:13:10] <Totalabyss> its america totaly america
[0:13:19] <Julkson> My one rule is "if it has circles, it's korean". Not sure if that is correct
[0:13:30] <Panopticon01> this is friggin impossible - this is sooo friggin stereotypical of korean countryside in winter
[0:13:31] <%Samex_Comex> It's the Earth Kingdom
[0:13:45] <Shiptia> Looks like Italy to me. Or maybe athens?
[0:13:45] <+daveronald> korean has lots of little circles in the writing
[0:13:48] <%GardenHills> imagine being able to travel
[0:13:48] <+NewGnu> no way, man. that's wisconsin
[0:13:48] <%boatzndhoez> I hope you visit a lot of cities :D
[0:13:50] <Schuhart> Oh no! This whole thing is super cozy!
[0:13:52] <%PleasantLee> the sign itself does have american stylings
[0:13:53] <+DeadStage> I'm the same man, grew up all my life in Wales.
[0:14:24] <Panopticon01> "J names" in korean.... oh boy
[0:14:37] <%PleasantLee> theres a key word in that sign that would help alot
[0:14:38] <+TipsyND> Okay but which Korea?
[0:14:52] <Panopticon01> well there are roads and electricity so its south
[0:14:53] <Vlad_Tech> It's not pathetic at all bittieDerp People have finances and social necessities that keep them from traveling. The majority of people don't travel far from their homes in their life time. bittieDerp
[0:15:26] <Ariddic> well, there was a beach nearby
[0:15:26] <Fenlig> Landmine resistant animals
[0:15:36] <Dalek_V> so it being full of landmines is bull or are they simply lucky?
[0:15:49] <%PleasantLee> says beach
[0:15:50] <Vlad_Tech> A bit of both.
[0:15:52] <+Amakuni1> Pretty sure they don't allow google map vehicles in North Korea
[0:15:56] <Panopticon01> tons of landmines are magnetic or only a certain weight triggers them
[0:15:58] <Coystick> Isn't there something like that happening in Chernobyl, cuz the animals are pretty fine with a little radiation?
[0:16:06] <jackmcslay> I think small animals can't trip landmines
[0:16:14] <The_Slag_Bag> It says Jangho on the sign
[0:16:27] <leinadtonu> My country's passport is so puny I can only travel to other hellholes...
[0:16:37] <Vlad_Tech> oof
[0:16:46] <Coystick> Hero rats detecting landmines in SA is some of the sweetest stuff you can read about.
[0:16:47] <Ariddic> pretty close
[0:17:07] <%PleasantLee> haha, fuck you, trees
[0:17:11] <Ariddic> we need a sign

[0:23:40] <%Murphio_GS> Ukraine aka country from stalker
[0:23:46] <JoshManVGH> Nice of you yo enhance his buttcrack when passing by though.
[0:23:47] <jetpack_rorschasch> We learned that people have buttcracks in Russia/eastern europe. How fascinating!
[0:23:49] <ChrisPlaysThing> super russia
[0:23:52] <%Bigchill___> Syr-lic?
[0:23:54] <+king_wragles> the 2nd one I believe
[0:23:55] <+tussletoes> pripyat 2
[0:23:55] <+SpongeTGS> @SpongeTGS yeah but you can't... there's leaderboards, rankings, handmade maps with collections of locations that would take one player hours to even play one 100th of if they had to keep going to maps.google to play the game by themselves
[0:23:55] <dukenux> I love geo guesser tho
[0:23:56] <AlyphHelix> just put a detective hat over your regular hat
[0:23:56] <Ariddic> I know the country, the crosswalk signs give it away
[0:23:58] <Teras_ode> acryllic
[0:23:58] <%Murphio_GS> I pronounce it Syr-ilic
[0:23:59] <ChrisPlaysThing> Cyrillic
[0:23:59] <dukenux> Cyrillic
[0:24:00] <lloyddboy> Seared Illic
[0:24:00] <+ConLin_Arts_> oh fun! I really love Vinesauce Joel's Geoguessr streams, they are always chill and fun

[0:24:06] <+twohitgood> instrumen
[0:24:07] <jackmcslay> more cyrillic
[0:24:12] <ErikFeral> no it's too late.  facebook already died today. i need the parasocial online interactions
[0:24:14] <+twohitgood> Cyrillic. sirillic
[0:24:18] <ChrisPlaysThing> Might be Dutch Kappa
[0:24:18] <Laecerelius> These kinda things tend to pick the same general areas a lot.
[0:24:21] <+Shadian> it's all ugly brutalism
[0:24:24] <+keyoray> was that a wendy's?
[0:24:24] <baltazar758> Cyrillic script
[0:24:28] <tanarath> very little
[0:24:28] <+tussletoes> brutalism PRETTY
[0:24:28] <tylko_olimpia> yellow-white crossing zone is in Russia , not in Ukraine
[0:24:30] <rReizs> it would just be east europe to some degree
[0:24:33] <Medo3G> website links in ads
[0:24:36] <jetpack_rorschasch> That sign was a clue. Check the writing.
[0:24:37] <+ThomasOfTroy> This is either Russia or Belarus, Ukrainian has more latin-esque symbols
[0:24:37] <+king_wragles> sir-rill-ic
[0:24:38] <%Murphio_GS> Ukraine is radioactive, whereas Russia isn't (mostly)
[0:24:39] <Coystick> It's all beautiful Brutalism
[0:24:42] <andre11dr> Russia and Ukraine are basically the same shit
[0:24:47] <+BinaryFireball> like cyrus
[0:24:48] <alg1dus> just say sissylyric
[0:24:48] <Mister_McDerp> all those eastern slavic countries are pretty similar

[0:42:31] <Fenlig> Vaseline explosion
[0:42:34] <+strakillias> I don't think it would be England b/c parking is on the right side of the road.
[0:42:36] <dukenux> Algorithm censored naughty tr**s
[0:42:38] <+VashSyndicate> Germany!
