[0:09:18] <+LTKonnor> !uptime
[0:09:18] <@Nightbot> 9 minutes 27 seconds
[0:09:18] <Burningskull01> Wedge is fat.
[0:09:20] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> MERC
[0:09:21] <%JantDarvus> Okay, being completely serious, is it just me thinking Wedge kind of looks like a fat woman
[0:09:25] <rubbishbinge> Wedge is pretty cool here
[0:09:26] <Burningskull01> No one interacts with fat people
[0:09:31] <+SirGO0SE> he's the bull
[0:09:33] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Power bottom
[0:09:37] <rubbishbinge> He dies or something
[0:09:37] <+silvery_cricket> he is the face
[0:09:40] <+jiggy_snipe> I like Wedge
[0:09:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> He's the emotional support
[0:09:40] <CurrySauseBandit> He's the good vibes.
[0:09:43] <+BopBeep> Wedge does have some eye liner
[0:09:46] <+silvery_cricket> he is the one that recruits people
[0:09:50] <+silvery_cricket> with the flyers
[0:09:50] <$sleepy_coffee> Wedge probably smashes all the puss
[0:09:50] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Wedge is the power bottom
[0:09:51] <studleydoorite> he's the Wedge, holds the door open
[0:09:54] <FuqBoiSlim> Wedge is the team mascot
[0:09:58] <filialpails> tifa's all up-front
[0:09:59] <nesbitt22> Barret is the tough guy

[0:10:26] <Valis77> Top Heavy if you will
[0:10:32] <+silvery_cricket> Wedge standing at the corner of a street handing out flyers "Do you wanna join Avalanche?"
[0:10:32] <RamirezGloom> Lord Plague! :3
[0:10:44] <defaultname3887> jesus christ plague i just realized i didn't follow you here

[0:10:58] <defaultname3887> hows the demo thou
[0:11:01] <+tymetak> whoa cloud has a stinger
[0:11:01] <Burningskull01> how did you get the mini map active?
[0:11:03] <nesbitt22> Rufus
[0:11:07] <rubbishbinge> Rufus
[0:11:12] <Burningskull01> i just played the demo earlier and didn't have a minimap
[0:11:13] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> Uncle Ruckus
[0:11:16] <+Estuko> imagine naming your son Rufus
[0:11:17] <Pnutz409> woofus
[0:11:18] <Valis77> ^
[0:11:22] <xiccy> panther
[0:11:26] <WhackyChiraqi> all dogs are special
[0:11:29] <RamirezGloom> combat looks kinda... stilted.. its not "smooth" action combat like Tales of Vesperia...
[0:11:31] <$sleepy_coffee> The people who will treat this as a dmc lite game will be destroying controllers
[0:11:32] <Zjay87> barrier
[0:11:37] <Pnutz409> does he pet the dog?
[0:11:37] <arkv01> not sure about the retcon of trying to absolve avalanche of bioterrorism by making the bomb a dud
[0:11:39] <nesbitt22> Dog is God
[0:11:43] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> is the stagger system basically persona weakness stuff?
[0:11:48] <DaKnightWarrior> smart dog
[0:11:49] <arkv01> oops ecoterrorism
[0:11:50] <rubbishbinge> you can only kill dogs in this game
[0:11:50] <$sleepy_coffee> Spell dog
[0:11:51] <+SirGO0SE> my dog cast sit :)
[0:11:51] <+LTKonnor> bruh
[0:11:51] <+thackattack00> @Burningskull01 I think you hit one of the shoulder buttons for the minimap
[0:11:54] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes That "dpg" looks more like a mutant Panther
[0:11:55] <Triblade1992> Plague there is Red XIII clones in the vein of XIV and XV as well.
[0:11:55] <+Typhaeon> Panther tentacle dog
[0:12:03] <+Estuko> That swing arc Kreygasm
[0:12:04] <+thackattack00> I dont quite recall tho
[0:12:04] <ScreamLord> *"dog"
[0:12:05] <$sleepy_coffee> Cat dog
[0:12:05] <Burningskull01> @thackattack00 thanks i'll try that later :)
[0:12:10] <Valis77> girl will love that Panther ^_^
[0:12:11] <WhackyChiraqi> (/\) Dio Mode
[0:12:12] <%JantDarvus> So did you ever figure out the deal with the dogs or are they legit just a million times beefier than the soldiers?
[0:12:16] <Valis77> as a pet
[0:12:23] <arkv01> the puppers a mean boy now but when he's in the break room with his handlers, he's a treat
[0:12:28] <laserbeaming> I kind of wish the dogs just fled instead of dying
[0:13:04] <+Estuko> @laserbeaming I spent so much points in FO4 just to tell dogs to piss off with that animal'intimidation perk instead of gunning them down lol.
[0:13:04] <arkv01> rufus's panther?
[0:13:09] <Triblade1992> Probably @PlagueOfGripes There is XIV and XV in the remake
[0:13:13] <bear_breaker20> not a fan of slow time?
[0:13:23] <nesbitt22> The Final version of Guard dog
[0:13:25] <Triblade1992> So it might be XVI that is Shinra dog
[0:13:34] <arkv01> "oops, no power for you"
[0:13:37] <$sleepy_coffee> They shall call him big rog
[0:13:37] <+Typhaeon> He of legendary stream endurance
[0:13:45] <Valis77> yeah
[0:13:47] <laserbeaming> @Estuko War Groove, an Advance Wars like game has Dog Units. They flee combat when defeated instead of dying.
[0:13:47] <mikukojitsu> oh shit i caught the plauge! stream
[0:13:49] <+SirGO0SE> 20 yr old spoilers LUL
[0:13:50] <Valis77> i rei was there
[0:13:55] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> smashing baby red puppers makes me more sad
[0:14:03] <+thackattack00> He also talked about chapter 7 with the air buster and shit
[0:14:03] <Valis77> max explains alot in that stream
[0:14:06] <nesbitt22> AirBurster as well
[0:14:08] <+Typhaeon> Differences
[0:14:13] <arkv01> oh my god I hope tifa has grapple moves
[0:14:17] <+MeatBomb> Does this game feel accessible for us slower folks?
[0:14:17] <arkv01> suplex the shit outta things
[0:14:21] <+LTKonnor> Grappler Tifa
[0:14:22] <Burningskull01> everything he said tho sounds like it'll make the story better
[0:14:27] <+LTKonnor> rxtroS
[0:14:28] <Valis77> yes change is very noticable
[0:14:29] <+Estuko> @arkv01 did they give her a flash step like in Dissidia 012
[0:14:48] <$sleepy_coffee> Oh nice
[0:14:49] <TheAsylumCat> color me curious about the revamped story
[0:14:49] <Triblade1992> Yes, Motomu Toriyama and Nomura are putting in what they wanted to make it "Midgar Section: The Game" back in the original 1997 game
[0:15:02] <%JantDarvus> Barret needs to chill the fuck out my god
[0:15:04] <arkv01> probably not a straight up flash step, just an ultra quick strafe
[0:15:04] <Valis77> did you see the part in max's video where people were backseat gaming? i have that clip
[0:15:20] <Valis77> man it was so what we streamers feel
[0:15:23] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> it's smart since this "part 1" has to be a complete story for people. if it cut off after midgar without any extra story stuff it'd be super weird
[0:15:29] <$sleepy_coffee> Jessie splorching
[0:15:36] <Burningskull01> Jessie is a 12
[0:15:43] <+Grayhammatter> jessie is splooshing hard
[0:15:43] <MoulesFritz> mopey emo cloud was fanon'd so hard it became canon
[0:15:49] <arkv01> doesn't barret's black factor just keep decreasing as the game goes on?
[0:15:50] <nesbitt22> I love Barret and Cloud back and forth
[0:15:51] <BurdRightsActivist> PLAGUE STREAMS??
[0:15:53] <Valis77> slooshing Kapp a
[0:15:58] <bear_breaker20> was she always a hoe?
[0:15:59] <+MeatBomb> Is Wedge just a ghost?
[0:16:01] <arkv01> like by the time we get to disc 2 barret just talks like everyone else
[0:16:02] <TheAsylumCat> Barret is exactly and more of what I expect
[0:16:03] <CurrySauseBandit> Cloud will probably grow in more as they get farther in with Tifa and such.
[0:16:10] <rubbishbinge> Jessie is PARCHED
[0:16:11] <BurdRightsActivist> I'm the COOLEST
[0:16:13] <DaKnightWarrior> PogChamp
[0:16:18] <trianglehat> remember it for the rest of your life
[0:16:20] <$sleepy_coffee> We call that the back splash
[0:16:24] <Snirtax> Never miss an occasion to drop a good one liner
[0:16:35] <Burningskull01> I wonder if you will be able to turn off tutorials on the main game.
[0:16:35] <+kyh9> Cloud being a tryhard is the only true canon interpretation of his character in FF7.
[0:16:36] <xiccy> I recall that the original Japanese Cloud was alot closer to the mopey Cloud that people don't like
[0:16:40] <vincerocmm> set bullets to sting
[0:16:45] <nesbitt22> Is Cloud Shadow the Hedgehog?
[0:16:56] <arkv01> is this cloud's VA the same one from AC?
[0:17:00] <Valis77> yeah
[0:17:02] <+jorgamund> man, this ATB system is just as innovative as ever Kappa
[0:17:03] <arkv01> been like 15 years
[0:17:05] <nesbitt22> No
[0:17:09] <TheAsylumCat> random guard-"who the fuck is this dork with the compensation sword?"
[0:17:15] <nesbitt22> Why
[0:17:18] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> fuck that box
[0:17:19] <j0ustar> but it always was-
[0:17:22] <FuqBoiSlim> I thought the whole caste were new VAs
[0:17:28] <$sleepy_coffee> Global terrorists
[0:17:28] <Pnutz409> wait it is?
[0:17:29] <+Risingxiv> Barret said "fuk this box!"
[0:17:31] <jellssssss20> Her boob armour is so pointy
[0:17:35] <arkv01> uh you mean a terrorist cell?
[0:17:36] <Burningskull01> the whole VA cast is new
[0:17:44] <vonmaultke> I mean they operate out of a shitty basement in a slum, why is it global?
[0:17:47] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:17:48] <Valis77> metal pointy boobs mean that her breast are large
[0:17:50] <Triblade1992> I want the part where Zack fought an army back in Crisis Core to the death to fix a WHOLE lot of issues with the original FF7
[0:17:50] <$Rshiners> in base game it's implied to be much bigger, but it kind of petered out and this is all thats left
[0:17:51] <+tymetak> perky boob metal
[0:17:51] <j0ustar> I mean in the original it's implied that most of cosmo canyon were rebels though. you do meet them
[0:17:56] <+Estuko> @Valis77 points
[0:17:57] <Snirtax> If they're an independed cell how does that change literally anything ?
[0:18:02] <Coystick> Avalanche is a global organization that resists Jessie charms, destined to fail
[0:18:07] <BurdRightsActivist> AVALANCHE operates over the Dark Web selling captain planet DVDs.
[0:18:08] <nesbitt22> So not like Star Wars Rebels
[0:18:11] <jellssssss20> Maybe you will meet them in this version?
[0:18:12] <arkv01> T H I R S T
[0:18:19] <gordieda20> doodOuch
[0:18:22] <+SirGO0SE> jess wants the pp
[0:18:26] <NoHueManatee> weren't they part of a network of small groups with different names in the original?

[0:19:40] <BurdRightsActivist> PREACH BRUDDHA
[0:19:41] <arkv01> plague if your dad has a gun arm
[0:19:43] <laserbeaming> I really, really like this Barret
[0:19:43] <Ardyn_1zunia> Your dad sounds like a black preacher?
[0:19:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Best line in the game
[0:19:51] <ahaegotrigger> DAMN
[0:19:51] <j0ustar> makes no sense that Heidegger wouldn't recognize cloud's uniform considering it's the official Soldier First class one but hey videogames
[0:19:52] <Valis77> Church time
[0:19:55] <FuqBoiSlim> can we get an amen from the congregation?

[0:19:58] <bear_breaker20> ironic of cloud to say get help
[0:19:59] <Pnutz409> i pity the fool!
[0:20:01] <%JantDarvus> I still love Cloud's reaction honestly.
[0:20:01] <TheAsylumCat> Barret is wakkas descendant
[0:20:03] <Exiliator> woolieSMUG
[0:20:04] <ahaegotrigger> I love Cloud in this
[0:20:07] <$sleepy_coffee> Them con trails shitting out the gay frog chemicals
[0:20:11] <BurdRightsActivist> Isn't Berret a boomer?
[0:20:13] <nesbitt22> The Planets drying Brrrt
[0:20:14] <Valis77> jessie was like "This is Hot"

[0:20:15] <roytingtwitch> we're all boomers here
[0:20:21] <+LTKonnor> tfw boomer dad rxtroYamero
[0:20:25] <+thackattack00> PlagueofBoomers
[0:20:36] <Bossingtonhuggermugger> Berret is fighting for the planet, that's the most anti Boomer shit
[0:20:40] <bear_breaker20> @BurdRightsActivist not even in the meme way boomer wouldnt be out of the house
[0:20:47] <BurdRightsActivist> People like your dad are the reason why Chemtrail became a demon in SMT 4
[0:20:47] <Valis77> Im Xennial
[0:20:49] <Triblade1992> Well I don't go with that for the game. It has to be in game like a Datalog in FF13 or something
[0:20:50] <+Estuko> Jessie's cute, I like her a lot.
[0:20:51] <+Taglog7> and breast ....plate
[0:20:51] <MoulesFritz> she has ANIME eyes

[0:20:52] <ahaegotrigger> DAMN
[0:20:53] <joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> flat ass
[0:20:54] <%kyh9> Her worst quality is her resistance to bullet, or lack thereof
[0:20:55] <Burningskull01> wrong. her best quality is her red hair....
[0:20:56] <%JantDarvus> Jesse's best quality is being an unsubtle tutorial.
[0:20:57] <j0ustar> Jessie's best quality is Jessie
[0:20:57] <$sleepy_coffee> False move and Barret will shoot turrets
[0:20:57] <+Grayhammatter> yehehe
[0:20:58] <Coystick> No it's her ponytail
[0:21:02] <+reiface08> sharp polygonal titty armor
[0:21:03] <arkv01> are they making jessie ultra thirsty to make her death sad later?
[0:21:03] <Valis77> her hair is a good feature
[0:21:04] <laphyrion> Barret: "One false move, and I'll cover your back!"
[0:21:09] <Madbearv> Doesn't Cloud have super human strength
[0:21:16] <Valis77> but her being slinder is more then enough to love her
[0:21:22] <Coystick> Have you not seen fumoffu, the ponytail is a lost art
[0:21:26] <$sleepy_coffee> Stealth mission? Need reflective titty armor
[0:21:29] <TheAsylumCat> @madbearv yup
[0:21:50] <FuqBoiSlim> it's not real armor. it's some cosplay piece she picked up from a thrift shop because avalanche could get the money for real armor
[0:21:54] <TheAsylumCat> @sleepy_coffee gotta dazzle em somehow
[0:21:54] <DaKnightWarrior> this angle is strange at times.
[0:22:00] <roytingtwitch> plague you should play dirge of cerberus some day for fun
[0:22:00] <heartlesshealer> maybe edge of screen weirdness
[0:22:12] <Burningskull01> if you are trying to move the camera while locked on it'll switch targets.
[0:22:14] <arkv01> was there any mention of a world map?
[0:22:28] <Valis77> intruder alert! Intruder alert! SHUT UPP! - Batman Forever
[0:22:34] <MoulesFritz> excited to watch jessies armor tiddies for the next hour or so
[0:22:37] <TheAsylumCat> @roytingtwitch oh god my guilty pleasure game
[0:22:51] <+zaibatsu_member_333> o_0
[0:22:53] <%JantDarvus> USE YOUR INTELLECT, EVADE MY BLOWS
[0:23:04] <roytingtwitch> @TheAsylumCat haha i do want to check it out just out of interest
[0:23:05] <BurdRightsActivist> @FuqBoiSlim She picked it up from a Con, and the Vender had to answer in-character when she asked if it blocks bullets.
[0:23:23] <Watumean> hey plague!!!
[0:23:29] <Burningskull01> i think if you shortcut someone elses spells it lets you tell your party members what to do without having to use the command menu
[0:23:31] <arkv01> thought it was kinda weird they switched up cloud's spells into barret
[0:23:38] <arkv01> guess they won't be havint that materia tutorial talk
[0:23:49] <bear_breaker20> did you see all the extra laser quotes?
[0:23:50] <+zaibatsu_member_333> run into it
[0:23:51] <MoulesFritz> if the lasers are so deadly why din't they use laser guns?
[0:23:52] <rubbishbinge> fetish time
[0:23:54] <%JantDarvus> You would think that if you're using lasers as a security system you would just have them stay on?
[0:23:58] <TheAsylumCat> @roytingtwitch it's bad, but I love it for some reason. imagine a poorly done DMC clone in ff7 land
[0:24:00] <laserbeaming> I don't remember, can you switch Cloud out of the party freely in the original FF7?
[0:24:00] <trianglehat> so thirsty
[0:24:05] <$sleepy_coffee> It’ll shave your hair spikes
[0:24:07] <Dao_Puppy> Can I hit L+R to backflip through them though?
[0:24:07] <+SirGO0SE> do fetish
[0:24:07] <%JantDarvus> And not also have gaps so big someone could just slip through
[0:24:24] <Triblade1992> Me neither
[0:24:24] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Plague Just go the Jessie route
[0:24:27] <%kyh9> Safety lights
[0:24:27] <Coystick> Praise me more mommy
[0:24:28] <+SirGO0SE> aww you havent seen fetish huh?
[0:24:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Please
[0:24:31] <Jimevera> Christmas lights
[0:24:32] <Valis77> CLessie is cannon :P
[0:24:32] <codycurry52> Give her the Buster sword!
[0:24:40] <+Risingxiv> Left the chrismas lights up
[0:24:48] <rubbishbinge> Underground Christmas
[0:24:50] <arkv01> these lasers are to filter out the strong from the weak among new hires
[0:24:51] <trianglehat> LUL
[0:24:52] <+SirGO0SE> let yourself get hit a bunch more
[0:24:56] <+MeatBomb> It's Chistmas, in MAKO, and I'm feelin' good...
[0:24:56] <$sleepy_coffee> Gotta get the Christmas streamer lights
[0:24:57] <+jorgamund> oww, my hubris!
[0:24:59] <serpenttucker> The engineers that work down here all the time were just bored as hell and put them up to spruce up the place
[0:25:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> They put them up for the Christmas party and forgot to take them down
[0:25:06] <Valis77> i wonder if the relationship effects the lazer
[0:25:08] <Burningskull01> funny note... the final laser thing flashes 7 times before pausing
[0:25:13] <+tymetak> less effective than an actual chainlink fence
[0:25:16] <Coystick> If you get his there's a 00.1% chance Jessie will say "Ara ara"
[0:25:22] <Coystick> hit*
[0:25:22] <TheAsylumCat> I assume the Christmas lights are for power outages and are linked to a backup generator
[0:25:23] <Valis77> yes she does say that cloud has a leser fetish if you keep doign it
[0:25:25] <+Risingxiv> yea those 2 guys were difficult
[0:25:29] <+zaibatsu_member_333> lies an slander
[0:25:36] <MoulesFritz> looks like bees
[0:25:43] <+SirGO0SE> sawlthf
[0:25:46] <BurdRightsActivist> Tchryophobia monkaS
[0:25:46] <zocano> You just use magic on them and they die, don't think they were very difficult
[0:25:49] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @Coystick don't play with my heart NotLikeThis
[0:25:50] <laserbeaming> Touch da mesh
[0:25:50] <Pnutz409> Man. this brings me back... getting the ff7 demo playing that forever

[0:26:02] <Valentinius_Anodyne> trypophilia more like

[0:26:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I gotta find out if Jess says ara-ara now..

[0:28:28] <Coystick> Jessie just trying to get laid but their dorking makes it so hard
[0:28:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Cloud/Berret FUCK in the ferris wheel
[0:28:29] <kiwicoffin> she's lithe
[0:28:29] <arkv01> they wouldn't dare retcon out the barret cloud date

[0:29:11] <Valis77> you can camera angle her in this part

[0:29:15] <+Taglog7> Kreygasm pancake ass
[0:29:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> yuffie has the body of a child compared to Jess

[0:30:00] <Explodincatz> amEEEzing
[0:30:01] <Coystick> She wants you to succ her mind
[0:30:02] <$sleepy_coffee> Oh no
[0:30:03] <bear_breaker20> why do they have to sexualize the character we know is dead
[0:30:08] <+Deft_Thought> "These assholes BEEP BOOP BOP BOP"
[0:30:09] <+zaibatsu_member_333> go back to Jessiie Nhooooooo
[0:30:12] <Burningskull01> in other words. she's ok if you date Tifa and keep Jessie on the side.
[0:30:14] <TheAsylumCat> Jessie is ovulating right now
[0:30:15] <arkv01> @Betofall now I'm seeing cloud rawdogging the reactor and looking up at Jessie
[0:30:37] <Valis77> Jessie wants Makop babies
[0:30:39] <MoulesFritz> the only game where the terror cell causing a nuclear meltdown are the goodies
[0:30:40] <Betofall> Jessie It's not working!
[0:30:40] <Valis77> mako
[0:30:45] <Valis77> yeah speed runs lol
[0:30:47] <arkv01> wait so Mako is literally a juice now?
[0:30:52] <arkv01> I thought mako was green vapors
[0:31:06] <Valis77> Or if that one guy levels up to 100 in this spo only
[0:31:06] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> people are going for the longest possible playthrough, apparenmtly Max is at 14 hours
[0:31:10] <Krimxon> what about the tech once game gets a PC release and the degens get hold of those models KappaPride
[0:31:10] <Burningskull01> i have a problem of saving my atb for when the enemy becomes preassured ><
[0:31:12] <TheAsylumCat> @bear_breaker20 there's a sliiim chance that won't be it. paper thin slim
[0:31:14] <+thackattack00> You can sprint through the entire laser section if you time it right
[0:31:17] <DaKnightWarrior> Fire spell dose big damage if you hit the robots back with it.
[0:31:25] <+fingalights> Mako has different forms. It is a liquid in many parts, but comes in vapor a lot
[0:31:36] <+Heart0fInk> I look forward to the nude mods!
[0:31:40] <殺害者> Considering this game was in development since Adam and Eve walked the Earth. I wonder how it'll be recieved on launch
[0:31:42] <$sleepy_coffee> Naw it’ll stay the same
[0:31:45] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Heart nhoo
[0:31:46] <StaceMcGate> Part 2 travelling the world with different party members
[0:31:54] <Krimxon> I want Cloud model put in DMC5
[0:31:55] <JoeBecomesJoe> Mako is probably not very dense
[0:32:08] <arkv01> yeah those people uh
[0:32:11] <Burningskull01> will you upload your playthrough to youtube so it can be viewed for eternity?
[0:32:13] <arkv01> missing a few neural connections
[0:32:19] <Pnutz409> First
[0:32:21] <kiso52> i still havent finished death stranding and managed to not get spoiled
[0:32:22] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> Iv ebeen playing god of war for like 3 years

[0:32:26] <jacewolf_is_the_best> do da jerb
[0:32:27] <kiso52> good thing its kinda niche
[0:32:29] <Coystick> I play games at a glacial pace these days it's terrible
[0:32:33] <Triblade1992> I don't. I'm a person who has platinum'd games (like FF13 and FF15) so taking my time has been a good thing
[0:32:35] <StaceMcGate> I need one Young Blood
[0:32:42] <usurper_sos> Deep throated, hard R
[0:32:42] <kiso52> FULL THROATED HARD R
[0:32:45] <arkv01> who would be most likely to drop the hard R
[0:32:45] <Pnutz409> lol
[0:32:48] <kiso52> lollll
[0:32:48] <arkv01> reno?
[0:32:49] <+SirGO0SE> there are no N's in mother fucker Plague monkaS
[0:32:50] <TheAsylumCat> @joebecomesjoe I mean, its soul energy, I dunno what state of matter it would take
[0:32:50] <arkv01> definitely reno
[0:32:51] <Coystick> Just one n-word Barret pleeeeeeease
[0:32:56] <+Heart0fInk> From Barrett or at him?
[0:32:56] <+Taglog7> JIVE TURKEY
[0:32:57] <MoulesFritz> is this still the point where tifa told them you did everything zach did?

[0:33:04] <vincerocmm> hard R deep trout cloud
[0:33:08] <vonmaultke> I want one "White boy"
[0:33:09] <Pnutz409> M bomb. hard R?
[0:33:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:33:12] <Coystick> Call me a cracker for the love of gawd
[0:33:18] <%kyh9> 4
[0:33:20] <codycurry52> Marlene drops Hard R n-bomb
[0:33:20] <kiso52> or cracker
[0:33:20] <%kyh9> minutes
[0:33:21] <zmuno> @kyh9 lol
[0:33:26] <FennecZephyr> 20 minutes is still way too much time
[0:33:33] <Pnutz409> cocky ey
[0:33:36] <jacewolf_is_the_best> Boy you more white than a white chocobo
[0:33:38] <HollowMan190> what would he say that Sazh Katzroy isn't in this game
[0:33:38] <MattoBii> wonder what the difference will be in the final game
[0:33:42] <StaceMcGate> LUL
[0:33:43] <weissguard> I'm happy that Barret can actually do the victory fanfare after a fight. Makes me excited for hearing other characters do it.
[0:33:44] <FennecZephyr> They should really just have the timer continue to count down during the cutscenes
[0:33:44] <arkv01> marlene has the honorary privilege of dropping hard Rs
[0:33:45] <TheAsylumCat> Easter egg then
[0:33:47] <arkv01> daddy taught her right
[0:33:51] <JoeBecomesJoe> @TheAsylumCat Yeah it seems like when it clumps together it's a liquid but when you throw it into the air it vaporises easy
[0:33:55] <FennecZephyr> Also yeah, starting it now
[0:33:56] <Burningskull01> it did
[0:33:57] <Triblade1992> No you are not
[0:33:58] <+fingalights> I think so?
[0:33:59] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Barret isn't Samuel L Jackson eli
[0:34:01] <StaceMcGate> no, it started after
[0:34:05] <+Heart0fInk> no you're right
[0:34:06] <kiso52> WHAT IN THE HELL
[0:34:07] <arkv01> godFUCKING dammit this boss looks too good
[0:34:11] <Burningskull01> however there is a timer for Airbuster.
[0:34:14] <Explodincatz> i honestly think the full release will start the start before ths boss
[0:34:15] <kiso52> come on barette
[0:34:17] <TheAsylumCat> @joebecomesjoe is shinra ran by necromancers?
[0:34:19] <$sleepy_coffee> What if they had the timer upside down and it was 30 seconds?
[0:34:23] <kiso52> i want one "bitch are you for real?"
[0:34:27] <arkv01> what are the bosses in the rest of the game going to do? make me nut instantly?
[0:34:33] <Burningskull01> so since this is the first boss they probably removed the timer cause your just getting used to the mechanics
[0:34:44] <+fingalights> It would be 3 seconds then @sleepy_coffee
[0:34:46] <StaceMcGate> I'm looking at the original boss fight, timer started after you killed scorpion
[0:34:52] <+fingalights> Or E?
[0:35:06] <arkv01> the urge to cut its tail off tho
[0:35:11] <jacewolf_is_the_best> plagues learning
[0:35:13] <$sleepy_coffee> Yes E is enough time
[0:35:20] <JoeBecomesJoe> @TheAsylumCat They dont bring people back from the dead but they do use life energy and consume it so...liches?
[0:35:25] <kronostorm34> The level 1 hard playthroughs are gonna be incredible
[0:35:29] <+Heart0fInk> Will Hellhouse be in this?
[0:35:39] <usurper_sos> me :)
[0:35:50] <ahaegotrigger> hell yes
[0:35:52] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Lol LUL
[0:35:57] <zmuno> hit it on the cortachurro
[0:36:00] <kiso52> SOULJA BOI
[0:36:01] <StaceMcGate> have they confirmed lvl 1? You start off lvl 6
[0:36:03] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the second game will just be a hellhouse fight
[0:36:07] <BonemanJohn> Soulja boy
[0:36:09] <TheAsylumCat> @joebecomesjoe you also have Hojos fucked up sexperiments
[0:36:10] <Triblade1992> Cloud is stuck on the tanks back leg
[0:36:19] <arkv01> hellhouse is probably going to be the boss at the end of the destroyed road corridor
[0:36:24] <+Qsmash_> its targeting me :)
[0:36:28] <JoeBecomesJoe> @TheAsylumCat They better not gloss over that
[0:36:41] <kiso52> apparently a kotaku dude couldnt finish the demo
[0:36:46] <DaKnightWarrior> yeah, max beat it in 5 mins
[0:36:46] <+Heart0fInk> Hows the game feel to play? any good?
[0:36:47] <kiso52> or some game journo
[0:36:49] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> yeah if you stagger it by taking out the legs its prone to elemental attacks from the rear
[0:36:49] <$sleepy_coffee> Lol the laser targeter is that a suggestion
[0:37:02] <+Heart0fInk> I've never in my life played an FF game
[0:37:04] <StaceMcGate> they are 100% gonna retcon Hojo's sexperiments
[0:37:08] <jacewolf_is_the_best> i pity the fool that uses mako
[0:37:08] <codycurry52> Combats deep it's really fun once you learn how it works
[0:37:10] <+fingalights> Oh, i didn't even see the target lock
[0:37:11] <arkv01> I'm still kinda mad they didn't just replace cloud's model with lightning for the cornea bit
[0:37:11] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I'll take it Plague never played FF12
[0:37:14] <TheAsylumCat> @joebecomesjoe thank you team four star for" thiiis is my ffffffetish!"
[0:37:22] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I bet you'v eplayed ehrgiez though
[0:37:40] <jacewolf_is_the_best> get that robutt
[0:37:43] <usurper_sos> The generator is vulnerable to fire
[0:37:50] <DaKnightWarrior> @heart0fink super good. you should check out the demo.
[0:38:14] <+Heart0fInk> @DaKnightWarrior is it on Xbox or is it exclusive?
[0:38:19] <%JantDarvus> By the way Plague, see the inevitable 'kotaku journalist cannot into gaming' tweet for the boss fight?
[0:38:40] <+YelloGek> This all looks pretty darn great. Was this what FF15 brought about?
[0:38:52] <Triblade1992> This is basically the Stagger meter from FF13
[0:38:57] <supersugoisenpai1> I noticed that Barret's focus shot will stun it when it jumps on the wall, and will prevent the rocket attack
[0:39:03] <+fingalights> HA
[0:39:05] <MarylandJutsu> So Plague how does the fighting system feel to you?
[0:39:15] <Burningskull01> except the stagger system is better than FF13 cause it doesn't fall off
[0:39:17] <%kyh9> You program XII
[0:39:20] <Burningskull01> at least not in the demo so far
[0:39:20] <+Nobrev> just turn gambits off 4Head
[0:39:21] <arkv01> what kinda shitty laser can't cut through debris?
[0:39:22] <+Deft_Thought> "You don't want to get hit. Don't get hit!"
[0:39:24] <Pnutz409> hah
[0:39:25] <+OmegaWeltall> yea you program 12 and it goes by its self
[0:39:25] <+Deft_Thought> Okay, Cloud
[0:39:26] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> cloud reads gamepro
[0:39:35] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Alright I stand corrected
[0:39:50] <MarylandJutsu> Also the voice actor for Cloud is DOING A FANTASTIC JOB
[0:39:52] <StaceMcGate> Barret dead
[0:39:53] <Rodzzila> "don't get hit and then hit them" Cloud is a pro!
[0:39:53] <MarylandJutsu> big fan
[0:40:00] <+SirGO0SE> i honestly havent played a ff since 9 bc theyre all boring as hell but im real happy everyone is excited for this game
[0:40:05] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> how about metal skin
[0:40:06] <+YelloGek> Barret havin' his say during the slow-mo.
[0:40:16] <+fingalights> Stuck in the hallway sucks with missiles
[0:40:21] <zocano> @sirgo0se basically where I stand
[0:40:26] <StaceMcGate> Items requiring an action point fixed FF15's item abuse system
[0:40:33] <usurper_sos> You're hording potions
[0:40:33] <+Deft_Thought> This fight could use some telegraphing on the boss attacks
[0:40:42] <zocano> Nice to see ppl excited, I just couldn’t care less about FF
[0:40:43] <Valis77> Imagine the Ruby, Daimond and Emerald weapons will be like.
[0:40:49] <subnet255> can you change AI teammate behavior?
[0:40:58] <+Heart0fInk> Do they still let you name your party members?
[0:41:01] <Burningskull01> i think items will be much more important in the main game. MP seems to be a VERY limited resource
[0:41:01] <usurper_sos> 200
[0:41:02] <+fingalights> 200
[0:41:02] <StaceMcGate> 200 damage
[0:41:09] <arkv01> @Valis77 no thanks, I'll be middle aged by then FeelsBadMan
[0:41:14] <Valis77> ^%
[0:41:14] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the ruby weapon will just be a knock at your door, and a large man slugs you in the face when you open it
[0:41:17] <Valis77> ^
[0:41:20] <+zaibatsu_member_333> 200 <3 TakeNRG
[0:41:20] <Valis77> yeah
[0:41:22] <codycurry52> I was indifferent before this demo but the combats so good, it changed my mind.
[0:41:34] <Valis77> not to mentionknghts of the round that would be great
[0:41:52] <zocano> I found the combat wanting
[0:42:01] <+Heart0fInk> Yeah combat doesn't look half bad
[0:42:03] <arkv01> I think they might bring in KOTR a little earlier like they did with leviathan to keep the hype train alive after episode 1
[0:42:04] <zocano> was hoping it would be ... more action oriented than it is
[0:42:07] <zocano> More KH
[0:42:10] <StaceMcGate> means he is talking @PlagueOfGripes
[0:42:10] <+fingalights> ??
[0:42:14] <AlandAlice> is it finialy out?
[0:42:19] <+thackattack00> Demo
[0:42:26] <Burningskull01> you get the buff icon when you hold square during punisher mode
[0:42:27] <codycurry52> It's not ff15 which is good
[0:42:33] <arkv01> I mean OF COURSE it's got nanomachines son
[0:42:42] <+Shindeil> @plagueofgripes You talking about the fangs icon when you hold square in punisher mode?
[0:42:49] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> how many words can you speak in the frozen time
[0:42:50] <+MeatBomb> If Barret is Knuckles, and Cloud is Sonic, who is Miles?
[0:42:51] <Triblade1992> The combat is more FF13 x Kingdom Hearts
[0:42:59] <Valis77> Jessie
[0:42:59] <DaKnightWarrior> lytJEEZ
[0:43:12] <Valis77> tifa can be tails
[0:43:12] <arkv01> it's technically not frozen time, more max payne time
[0:43:15] <zocano> The combat is still very much ATB with more action oriented framing
[0:43:15] <supersugoisenpai1> No way they are giving us KOTR before the last episode. Bahamut though...
[0:43:15] <laserbeaming> Cloud is Tails. Tifa is Sonic
[0:43:22] <ThoughtTeaAnna> miles? yuffie?
[0:43:23] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Live an Learn
[0:43:27] <Valis77> ^
[0:43:31] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> hey frozen glass still moves
[0:43:32] <zocano> which ends up being pretty boring to me
[0:43:33] <Valis77> also from sonic advanture
[0:43:45] <+Heart0fInk> Tails would be sephiroth. obviously.
[0:43:48] <AlandAlice> not to complain but any reson they switch to real time?
[0:43:58] <+fingalights> Wooo
[0:44:02] <DaKnightWarrior> nice
[0:44:05] <StaceMcGate> that is a dramatic finish?
[0:44:05] <arkv01> @AlandAlice product of our era
[0:44:23] <+Skyebaker> Most moern gamers dont like turn based
[0:44:32] <arkv01> most people (read: zoomers) can't deal with turn based rpgs anymore
[0:44:32] <+Skyebaker> action real time appeals to a wider audience
[0:44:39] <Duke_of_HI> @plagueofgripes will you be scrapping all the bricks on full release?
[0:44:43] <Burningskull01> i wonder if enemies will respwan in the main game out side the first reactor
[0:44:46] <+MeatBomb> Sepriroth is definately Biggs the Cat.
[0:44:51] <AlandAlice> i would love it was the old one just better graphic and voice actiong and bit retooling
[0:44:52] <StaceMcGate> turn based is now reserved for below average JRPGs and Larian studio
[0:44:54] <laserbeaming> There's probably respawning enemies after this section
[0:44:58] <ThoughtTeaAnna> that run animation
[0:45:01] <ThoughtTeaAnna> lmao
[0:45:09] <zocano> That's cause strictly turn based menu combat is boring tpYGOkuriboh
[0:45:12] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It's so obvious that Cloud is TRYING to be cool but just can't quite succeed
[0:45:15] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it certainly does a better job of keeping tension or impetus
[0:45:15] <+Qsmash_> Dirge of Cerberus anyone?
[0:45:22] <+Qsmash_> anyone?
[0:45:29] <arkv01> man I liked dirge of cerb
[0:45:30] <Coystick> just...90% in?
[0:45:34] <StaceMcGate> Dirge of Ceberus is a 3rd person shooter
[0:45:36] <arkv01> like when it first came out
[0:45:39] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> after an hour of fighting gilgamesh and losing I can relate
[0:45:45] <+Heart0fInk> Yeah. push forward and mash attack AND parry Kappa
[0:45:47] <+SirGO0SE> and yet there arent enough character action games
[0:45:58] <Burningskull01> abilites and spells?
[0:45:59] <zocano> @SirGO0SE I know ):
[0:46:04] <Triblade1992> well Final Fantasy has been turn based for FF1-10 and FF13. MMO design with FF11, 12 and 14 with only FF`15 being action combat
[0:46:06] <Burningskull01> Focused Slash
[0:46:06] <+SirGO0SE> :(
[0:46:08] <StaceMcGate> focused slash?
[0:46:11] <BonzoBeanMachine> Just play as Vincent in the next FFVIIR game instead of Dirge of Cerberus
[0:46:11] <+fingalights> Stinger
[0:46:14] <zocano> All games are made better with just frame mechanics
[0:46:20] <Daxalog> Look at the bottom left side of the screen. Seeing the pulsing attack thing seems telling
[0:46:21] <zocano> and air dashing
[0:46:22] <Coystick> Jessie gettin S M A S H E D
[0:46:22] <arkv01> braver no longer a real limit break FeelsBadMan
[0:46:26] <codycurry52> Turn-based is great, it's trying to mixed turn-based and action that fucks everything up.
[0:46:29] <Explodincatz> way to many
[0:46:29] <+SirGO0SE> name 10
[0:46:39] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> bujingai
[0:46:43] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Jessie was amazing in that Boss fight!
[0:46:45] <cap_bon> MOAR
[0:46:47] <Animorphimagi> Yeah name 10
[0:46:47] <StaceMcGate> nwf
[0:46:48] <arkv01> braver kinda looks like shit now tbh
[0:46:48] <codycurry52> oh they fuckin
[0:46:49] <+Heart0fInk> My Hero! academia...
[0:46:50] <+TheSniperJoe> Jessie's glow up is impressive, Erica Lindbeck being best girl once again.
[0:46:50] <Coystick> no promises
[0:46:54] <AlandAlice> whats funny is i never new she was a girl based on her charater model
[0:46:54] <DaKnightWarrior> I love turn-based rpgs.
[0:46:54] <+NYCrownlessKing> the fun implementation with the character playstyles is maybe tifa does play like a character action game.
[0:46:54] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> rygar
[0:46:57] <+fingalights> The reactor is about to blow, you guys wait till later
[0:46:59] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I don't think Cloud quite knows what sex is yet
[0:46:59] <$sleepy_coffee> Jesses femur is sticking out
[0:47:00] <%JantDarvus> Wait so was Jesse even a non-super-minor character in FF7? I barely even remember she existed.
[0:47:04] <+NYCrownlessKing> but maybe aerith plays like a rhythm game
[0:47:06] <vonmaultke> you got 20 spare minutes, you can if you want
[0:47:12] <HollowMan190> yeah but there are like 5 well made ones
[0:47:13] <cap_bon> weee
[0:47:17] <zocano> Pretty sure I could but they're nearly all from the same two ppl and Darksiders 2 LUL
[0:47:18] <+MeatBomb> Gotta sing Snake Eater for climbing.
[0:47:19] <StaceMcGate> Jessie has about 12 minutes of screen time before she dies in first 6 hours of FF7
[0:47:21] <WarchiefGoldva> It's kinda hard to say "Whee" when climbing stairs because gravity doesn't help you say it.
[0:47:22] <usurper_sos> You have more than enough time, you can just walk
[0:47:23] <kiso52> das lewd plague
[0:47:28] <+Punishedkaiger> I'd clip into Jessie's body
[0:47:29] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> god of war, ninja gaiden, devil may cry, bayonetta, vanquish, metal gear rising, rising zan
[0:47:32] <bear_breaker20> yes
[0:47:32] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes Does he? He spent his teens in a tank
[0:47:33] <ScreamLord> Yesd
[0:47:33] <arkv01> I mean uh, he's sterile yeah?
[0:47:33] <+TheSniperJoe> Cloud knows what sex is, which is why he started off SUPER weak.
[0:47:34] <Triblade1992> YES
[0:47:34] <SuperVaderMan> absolutely
[0:47:34] <+Skyebaker> yea
[0:47:35] <codycurry52> yes
[0:47:35] <+fingalights> Yes
[0:47:35] <+zaibatsu_member_333> lol "shut up an Climb"
[0:47:35] <+TheSniperJoe> YES
[0:47:36] <kingra> Yes
[0:47:37] <Madbearv> god yes
[0:47:37] <heartlesshealer> Yes
[0:47:37] <undagi> yes
[0:47:37] <+not_crabby> 100
[0:47:38] <殺害者> Yes
[0:47:38] <vonmaultke> YES
[0:47:39] <+Meteo__> Yea
[0:47:39] <zocano> Don't forget Darksiders 2 @Big_Bang_BIitz
[0:47:41] <DaKnightWarrior> Y E S
[0:47:41] <+not_crabby> 100%
[0:47:42] <arkv01> cloud's PP works but he shoots blank no?
[0:47:43] <+TheSniperJoe> Zack, not a virgin though.
[0:47:44] <+SirGO0SE> hes a virgin to ladies ;0
[0:47:46] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> anddd darksiders 3
[0:47:55] <+fingalights> I mean, there are older ladies in town
[0:47:55] <WarchiefGoldva> He was trying too hard to Soldier but only Grunted instead.
[0:47:59] <kiso52> soulja boi
[0:48:00] <JoeBecomesJoe> I dont really think it matters much to him
[0:48:04] <+Heart0fInk> Is Red13 a virgin? asking the real questions.
[0:48:04] <Burningskull01> depending on how you treat Tifa it's strongly hinted at that they slept together before you go down into the North Crater in the original one.
[0:48:05] <StaceMcGate> Cloud was in a lab tank from age 17-21. no way did he lose his virginity
[0:48:07] <$doomp12> indefinitely
[0:48:08] <codycurry52> well not after the bathhouse
[0:48:12] <Triblade1992> I think most protags in FF are virgins outside of Cecil who actually did fuck
[0:48:15] <DaKnightWarrior> BabyRage
[0:48:17] <usurper_sos> S rank your Virginity
[0:48:19] <heartlesshealer> He's more like "gotta be Zack! Zack was the coolest so I need to be cool too!"
[0:48:20] <+ziggityzaq> He got penetrated by sephiroth
[0:48:20] <%JantDarvus> Plague I feel personally attacked
[0:48:22] <+TheSniperJoe> Was Squall a virgin?
[0:48:23] <bear_breaker20> n-no
[0:48:24] <askalta> yeah no way
[0:48:24] <AlandAlice> straight up vergain. plus lot this game is about finding your self
[0:48:26] <+thackattack00> lol
[0:48:27] <+tymetak> yea haha monkaS
[0:48:28] <+fingalights> He might have gotten some Midgar Strange when he first joined
[0:48:28] <HollowMan190> ummmm
[0:48:28] <+SirGO0SE> BAA-BAKA
[0:48:31] <+TheSniperJoe> In fact, which Protags are canon virgins?
[0:48:32] <殺害者> Everyone here will be a virgin till death
[0:48:33] <+Slaardacity> yeah hahahaha
[0:48:37] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> 1 out of 5 of your viewers poop in the shower
[0:48:38] <+YelloGek> FF7 world seems pretty unconcerned about that sort of thing.
[0:48:38] <+Slaardacity> not me
[0:48:42] <+Heart0fInk> I'm no virgin! I fap to furry porn!
[0:48:42] <arkv01> naw dawg squall def got laid with that t-rex
[0:48:44] <+Heart0fInk> wait...
[0:48:45] <Madbearv> why do you need someone else to reaffirm your masculinity plague?
[0:48:48] <weissguard> I'm glad I wasn't drinking water when you said that.
[0:48:57] <dakkster> I won't lose my virginity because I never lose
[0:49:06] <zocano> I just don't care for menu oriented combat unless it's in a tactics grid
[0:49:11] <StaceMcGate> Woolie refused to use lightning magic during his stream
[0:49:12] <BonemanJohn> like a real gamer vargGamerd
[0:49:26] <ScreamLord> I have absolutely know problem admiring that at 28 I am still a virgin. I'm not opposed to sex I'm just ambivalent to it
[0:49:33] <+Heart0fInk> It sounds like they kept Cloud as an emo boi. LAME!!!
[0:49:36] <zocano> FFTactics and XCOM are lovely and wonderful
[0:49:38] <arkv01> @StaceMcGate some kind of holdover from his church days about summoning lightning from heaven?
[0:49:40] <%JantDarvus> I'm not opposed to sex, girls just have cooties.
[0:49:48] <+Freelance7> @Heart0fInk absolutely not
[0:49:57] <bear_breaker20> @StaceMcGate becasue hes a try hard?
[0:49:57] <StaceMcGate> @arkv01 darlington, you using dem devil materia?
[0:50:00] <Triblade1992> That's why I like Kingdom Hearts and Devil May Cry
[0:50:00] <Animorphimagi> Examples
[0:50:03] <zocano> But give me standard FF and I start ResidentSleeper
[0:50:03] <arkv01> LUL
[0:50:04] <+tymetak> I wish this played more like a metal gear rising, but I understand why it doesn't
[0:50:05] <BonemanJohn> Cloud is a dork
[0:50:13] <+Risingxiv> Wth character action games are you talking about?
[0:50:19] <DaKnightWarrior> @screamlord good on you man lytTHUMBSUP
[0:50:19] <+NYCrownlessKing> are u referencing ur favorite game DMC
[0:50:19] <usurper_sos> Did you play DMC5 Plague?
[0:50:20] <+Heart0fInk> @Freelance7 he keeps saying 'Whatever' as a combat bark.
[0:50:20] <+NYCrownlessKing> Kappa
[0:50:23] <zocano> I was hoping this would have more of the movement of KH
[0:50:26] <FennecZephyr> @Risingxiv DMC DmC
[0:50:27] <StaceMcGate> @bear_breaker20 nah, I think just RPG inept. His mind goblins are command menus
[0:50:29] <+not_crabby> LUL
[0:50:31] <zocano> but it's way stiffer than I thought
[0:50:36] <zocano> kinda killed any interest I had
[0:50:38] <Triblade1992> Neir Automata kiind of has that same problem since the combat is really simplistic but much more refiined
[0:50:40] <arkv01> just giving us more fuel for the barret cloud lemons
[0:50:42] <Madbearv> I can be cool
[0:50:42] <+Freelance7> @Heart0fInk He's more indifferent than emo. He shows off sides of being a dork in this same demo.
[0:50:42] <kiso52> Barret: "come on cloud girls are watching"
[0:50:45] <zocano> and I didn't have much interest to begin with
[0:50:46] <Madbearv> I just don't want to
[0:50:48] <BonemanJohn> asshole LUL
[0:50:48] <+MeatBomb> Yeah, poorly thought out Rock Paper Scissors mechanics can really ruin a game for me.
[0:50:49] <arkv01> on top of the thousands that hav already been written
[0:50:58] <+Risingxiv> @FennecZephyr ooh the bad one, go figure
[0:51:07] <BonemanJohn> i wonder if we'll hear Cunt in the full game
[0:51:07] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I was hoping there would be dmc dlc that would be an rma or mgr, but I was sol
[0:51:09] <+Heart0fInk> @Freelance7 i'll have to see for myself.
[0:51:17] <StaceMcGate> I want a Monsoon style boss in this game
[0:51:18] <zocano> I gave FF7 like 10 hours of my time before I got bored and put it down
[0:51:22] <$sleepy_coffee> Do you think cloud is secretly swooning over Barret
[0:51:29] <heartlesshealer> two shock troopers
[0:51:30] <WarchiefGoldva> Two shock troopers, surprisingly tough to deal with.
[0:51:38] <arkv01> yeah I could not understand why the "combatants" were so fucking mobile
[0:51:46] <zocano> I actually finished FFX but I still don't think much of that game
[0:51:49] <zocano> same with 4
[0:52:01] <BonemanJohn> PogChamp Parry?
[0:52:05] <arkv01> like these guys have soldier tier mobility
[0:52:06] <+Neoripo> Why everyone i watch play this forgets using magic?
[0:52:08] <StaceMcGate> 4 was revolutionary for its time, but appears super fucking generic by todays standards
[0:52:24] <zocano> Ya I played the DS version when it came out
[0:52:26] <+Freelance7> Tifa has to be a lot of fun to play
[0:52:38] <zocano> Finished it but found it incredibly plain
[0:52:41] <StaceMcGate> FALSE FLAG
[0:52:42] <+fingalights> Tifa looks fun as hell
[0:52:44] <zmuno> @Freelance7 honkers?
[0:52:46] <Triblade1992> I not only finish all the main number FF games (outside of the MMOs), but I have platinumed FF13 and FF15.
[0:52:51] <Burningskull01> i would prefer to be able to play as one character only. but the ai is stupid and wont kill the laser turrets ><
[0:52:52] <arkv01> TIME TO ABSOLVE AVALANCHE OF CRIMES
[0:52:58] <StaceMcGate> I don't like this Retcon
[0:52:58] <+YelloGek> Nice smartphone.
[0:53:01] <BonemanJohn> PogChamp iPHONE 69
[0:53:02] <JoeBecomesJoe> I do want to see how Tifas roulette stuff will work
[0:53:04] <+Freelance7> It's not a retcon
[0:53:06] <+MeatBomb> Yo, Heidigger looks rad.
[0:53:10] <xxshadowxx416> you just attack them when they attack
[0:53:10] <Burningskull01> @StaceMcGate not a retcon
[0:53:19] <$sleepy_coffee> Pulls out his iphone
[0:53:21] <zocano> See I love tactics and strategy games
[0:53:22] <arkv01> this is absolutely a retcon
[0:53:23] <ScreamLord> Look at his weird Cyberpunk SmartPhone
[0:53:30] <zocano> but I find standard JRPG menu games boring as sin
[0:53:34] <+Heart0fInk> Did they just blow up their own reactor?
[0:53:39] <StaceMcGate> Not a retcon? Shinra just blew up their own reactor to make Avalanche seem worse
[0:53:40] <Burningskull01> in the original Jessie hints that the explosion was to big when you talk to her in the hideout
[0:53:43] <+Freelance7> Jessie talks about not expecting the explosion to be that big in the original game
[0:53:47] <codycurry52> how is this not a retcon?
[0:53:47] <+jiggy_snipe> wasn't there a convo between Cait Sith and Barrett about Avalanche's terrorism?
[0:53:48] <BonemanJohn> He's so cool he got his eyes closed
[0:53:49] <zmuno> @Heart0fInk yes
[0:53:50] <ThoughtTeaAnna> I wonder if vincent will be able to change into chaos form
[0:53:56] <Ipsenscastle> retcon is retroactive continuity, it doesnt apply to a remake, this is just something added, it doesnt supercede the original game
[0:53:58] <StaceMcGate> The game is defending eco terrorists
[0:53:58] <BurdRightsActivist> @Heart0fInk MAKO CAN'T MELT STEAL BEAMS. Reactor was an INSIDE JOB
[0:54:02] <Ipsenscastle> and they hinted at it there too
[0:54:02] <kiso52> 4X games require too much time for my liking since i can only get into them with friends in multiplayer
[0:54:07] <arkv01> they're trying to downplay the terrorism yeah
[0:54:07] <+Heart0fInk> That's.... really dumb..
[0:54:08] <heartlesshealer> Yeah, they did blow up their own reactor. They made it less subtle than it was in the original
[0:54:09] <%lovebass4stuff> lovebass4stuff subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:54:14] <arkv01> keep in mind this game was released before 911
[0:54:16] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:54:21] <MattoBii> there's just that one throwaway line from Jessie, but that was kind of it
[0:54:26] <StaceMcGate> sploosh
[0:54:28] <kiso52> jessie sploosh
[0:54:31] <Animorphimagi> Max is just plain wrong
[0:54:33] <kiso52> hahahah
[0:54:48] <cap_bon> Having never played the original I have no strong feelings either way
[0:54:48] <BonemanJohn> Advent children vibes from this
[0:54:52] <arkv01> less subtle? there is NO scene where shinra sends in their bots to blow it up rambo style
[0:54:56] <arkv01> it just shows the reactor blowing up
[0:54:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Max was saying that Shinra straight up says that they were using to blow up stuff. Idk where that is in the game
[0:55:02] <heartlesshealer> There's a line from Jessie though
[0:55:06] <arkv01> which for all we knew was just the bomb we set
[0:55:07] <+jiggy_snipe> using you*
[0:55:18] <$Rshiners> yea it felt that the world was shitty enough where people didn't care
[0:55:24] <Pnutz409> they do mention that they didn't think the bomb was gonna do that much damage
[0:55:25] <StaceMcGate> Shinra also destroyed a whole town to kill avalanche and blame them
[0:55:29] <Coystick> I like that they characters are still over acting with their gestures
[0:55:36] <+jorgamund> my eco-terrorist can't possibly be this cute uWu
[0:55:44] <codycurry52> Barret is to justify it to himself in the original, they were totally Terrorist
[0:55:55] <StaceMcGate> You can blame the phone game for them knowing what Avalanche is already
[0:55:58] <Triblade1992> Like how Zack Fair's death and how he dealt with Cloud has a lot of plot holes? And how Crisis Core fixed that part up in the end of that game?
[0:56:05] <ScreamLord> "Cloud's head is the logo" - Pat
[0:56:14] <ThoughtTeaAnna> it would make more sense given shinra's technology that they know abt avalanche tho
[0:56:17] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> ok, but when does cloud get his sword that turns into 7 swords
[0:56:18] <+Freelance7> Besides, we haven't seen Barret directly after this chapter. He could straight up say the collateral was worth it
[0:56:19] <+Heart0fInk> A plot point is that they have a vague idea where they were.
[0:56:24] <$sleepy_coffee> Aww yeh you beat the whole game
[0:56:27] <WarchiefGoldva> They STILL did do eco-terrorism. Shinra would never have had blown up the generator if Avalanche didn't do the bombing run.
[0:56:28] <BonemanJohn> yes :)
[0:56:34] <Jigokuro> 400 viewers and no mods? I can tap in if you want (I'm a long time mod for Nic.) Though tbh this chat seems pretty alright...
[0:56:37] <+Freelance7> Of course, war makes a lot of money
[0:56:41] <arkv01> I think they know its mostly adults who are playing this game now and that said adults would now realize you were doing big terrorist explosions as opposed to when kids played this and thought "damn, that's cool"
[0:56:48] <StaceMcGate> no hard mode?
[0:57:01] <bear_breaker20> i thought shinra were trying to tie avalanche to another force they were actually at war with
[0:57:01] <+azure22900> Well with this it seems they're after the guys attempting assassination.
[0:57:03] <professorno> why is it called final fantasy even th
[0:57:04] <+fingalights> Normal can be pretty tough
[0:57:14] <Coystick> Look at her LIPS
[0:57:16] <Madbearv> blowing up my own city to own the libs
[0:57:17] <kentrix11> As is tradition with Nomura games, hard mode will probably be added later, although maybe not.
[0:57:17] <+tymetak> Ill play this when the 3000$ complete edition with all 20 episodes releases. Il be 82 years old
[0:57:17] <Triblade1992> To be fair, the original FF7 almost became "Midgar Section: The Game"
[0:57:18] <ralphwiggum16> Hi Plague!
[0:57:21] <+MeatBomb> Profit... Profit never changes...
[0:57:23] <ralphwiggum16> It's me, Ralph
[0:57:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Im sure they'll think of a new reason why they fucked the PLATE
[0:57:31] <Burningskull01> in the original they say they are not going to repair the plate.
[0:57:33] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it's for the LIFE CYCLE
[0:57:35] <kentrix11> It's fine they have a lot of money plague.
[0:57:41] <StaceMcGate> Something something Mako energy is your explaination for that
[0:57:45] <Burningskull01> to they make money but not having to spend money on upkeeping it
[0:57:47] <JoeBecomesJoe> It's about sending a message Kappa
[0:57:47] <ralphwiggum16> Shinra is more money than god.
[0:57:49] <red_blaster> They would probably not repair the sector
[0:57:50] <kentrix11> Besides who cares they are leaving the planet from their perspective.
[0:57:52] <heartlesshealer> Dollars? But they are the energy company
[0:57:53] <cap_bon> are they using mako as natural gas
[0:57:57] <ralphwiggum16> And God is super rich.
[0:58:00] <Zjay87> I think the idea is that they wanted to focus on neo midgar maybe
[0:58:02] <+azure22900> Yeah but they were prepping to transcends so fuck midgar
[0:58:07] <arkv01> so is mako a gas or a liquid?
[0:58:08] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes And isn't most of the area outside the walls basically blasted wasteland?
[0:58:13] <Triblade1992> Yeah Shinra was just a greedy organization who wanted to make more money
[0:58:14] <+Heart0fInk> Yeah that feels very contrived
[0:58:17] <+Qsmash_> I took it as they meant to explode the reactor but the bomb was a dud
[0:58:19] <+fingalights> Is water a gas or a liquid
[0:58:22] <WarchiefGoldva> @PlagueOfGripes The only thing I truly want from this remake is for them to expand on that whole plot point because I think you're absolutely right. Why drop the plate? It makes no sense.
[0:58:23] <arkv01> hmm...
[0:58:24] <+hgtarras> He’s playing the demo again ?
[0:58:27] <+eanscrale> They're REALLY angular
[0:58:28] <StaceMcGate> Polygons are hard
[0:58:30] <KaliasTV> Now that the slums are crushed under the plate, it's time for gentrification
[0:58:31] <Jigokuro> Her hair is the same not-brown-but-not-blonde that I have...
[0:58:32] <heartlesshealer> water is a mercurial substance
[0:58:32] <Explodincatz> the models look great
[0:58:33] <ralphwiggum16> IT's a really hard style.
[0:58:33] <kentrix11> Don't draw them correctly just draw them as you can.
[0:58:38] <+Heart0fInk> what about now? can you draw them now?
[0:58:39] <BonemanJohn> PogChamp WOAH
[0:58:41] <ralphwiggum16> What's his name who designed them is kind of a genius.
[0:58:43] <heartlesshealer> changes depending on situations
[0:58:43] <$Rshiners> fuckin pizza
[0:58:44] <JoeBecomesJoe> Also they have that big promised land plan so I dont really know how much they care about Midgar
[0:58:45] <Coystick> Oh I think you could manage a good Jessie HINT HINT
[0:58:45] <DaKnightWarrior> lytMOTIVATED
[0:58:46] <StaceMcGate> and then the hidden 9th reactor underground Kappa
[0:58:50] <+hgtarras> I can’t believe this game is timed exclusive for a year
[0:58:59] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I remember a line of Jesse when they are in 7th heaven: "Did we do that? Oh god"
[0:59:18] <ralphwiggum16> Plague is this your first time playing this?
[0:59:24] <+Neoripo> Also 1 sector is being built
[0:59:31] <StaceMcGate> Jessie was just surprised her bomb was that strong
[0:59:31] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> cant wait for hd 7th heaven
[0:59:36] <cap_bon> Can you supplex a train in this one
[0:59:58] <codycurry52> I can't wait for them to finish this garbage to get to the real game.... with Squall Leonhart
[0:59:59] <Burningskull01> in the pinball room she says she must have mad a miscalculation but she just made it like the computer told her to.
[1:00:12] <arkv01> ok so we have actually hit peak FMV
[1:00:13] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> naw the real game is the chocobo racing
[1:00:24] <+hgtarras> What’s the lot for sephiroth again ? All special spoilers have his dna or something
[1:00:25] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes what confuses me is Aerith's mom flashback scene, when Jessie and Biggs come back from Wutai war and appear to be a couple
[1:00:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> wonder how the breeding will work
[1:00:28] <arkv01> gameplay finally looks like FF13 era FMVs
[1:00:28] <+Neoripo> Yeah, if you compare the translations to the original it really loses a lot of nuance
[1:00:32] <Triblade1992> I wonder if they will fix that translation mistake of how "Sephiroth was actually being controlled by JENOVA" in the Japanese version
[1:00:32] <+fingalights> Where the fan theory that it was an inside job comes,
[1:00:39] <+Qsmash_> couldn't Shinra just fix a 'disabled' reactor?
[1:00:41] <JoeBecomesJoe> When I was younger I figured she was talking about it blowing up too soon. Like they almost get caught in it
[1:01:05] <+fingalights> Yeah, I'd like a little more grey
[1:01:11] <Triblade1992> @arkv01 The game is co directed by Nomura and Motomu Toriyama. Toriyama was the one who directed the Midgar section of FF7 as well as FF10 and FF13 games
[1:01:18] <red_blaster> I mean, they still kill a million guards, so they're still terrorists
[1:01:31] <Burningskull01> also... who want's to constantly pick up items after every battle
[1:01:31] <StaceMcGate> but they were "evil" guards
[1:01:35] <heartlesshealer> good way to handle that with so much knockback going around
[1:01:36] <+fingalights> Guards aren't people Kappa
[1:01:37] <arkv01> @Triblade1992 oh no
[1:01:43] <codycurry52> I felt in the og Barret was just wreckless, and bent on revenge
[1:01:45] <kentrix11> In trailers Tifa does question what they do so hopefully they don't downplay it.
[1:01:54] <cap_bon> checking corners doesnt exist in this universe
[1:01:54] <WarchiefGoldva> Shinra blew up the reactor only because Avalanche attacked it, though. It still makes them very much responsible for the deaths of hundreds.
[1:01:58] <+azure22900> well to be fair the characters act like the reactor was supposed to blow up like that.
[1:01:59] <Triblade1992> @arkv01 It's a good thing because the two of them have made this game shine well\
[1:02:06] <kingra> @PlagueOfGripes Notice how they don't show Wedge Jumping over the rail
[1:02:08] <StaceMcGate> No DMG run
[1:02:10] <ralphwiggum16> combat looks like platinum
[1:02:10] <+Freelance7> @codycurry52 We haven't seen enough of him after this. He might still be.
[1:02:10] <arkv01> yeah if it was toriyama prior to ff13
[1:02:13] <heartlesshealer> also simulates the "just getting the items" post-battle thing that was in classic
[1:02:14] <arkv01> man's a freak after that
[1:02:22] <ralphwiggum16> guarantee they got Platinum on this.
[1:02:25] <bear_breaker20> fuck wedge
[1:02:27] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes This game kind of expects you to take hits, kinda like a regular rpg.
[1:02:37] <nerdblase> Reset!
[1:02:38] <red_blaster> They make a reference to Before Crisis in this game, so I guess the fact that Rufus created Avalanche is still canon?
[1:02:44] <+fingalights> Avalanche bombs can't melt steel beams. It's obviously an inside job
[1:02:46] <Triblade1992> @arkv01 Nah, the main entry games he directed are decent. And you can tell it transfered over to the remake
[1:02:51] <+Freelance7> Yeah. You're gonna take hits. This ain't completely character action
[1:03:01] <Coystick> They're WASHROOMS
[1:03:03] <StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes How do you think they'll powerscale between part 1 and 2? Just revert you back to lvl 1?
[1:03:05] <heartlesshealer> Oh yeah, the play and that thing with the Banora White apples
[1:03:05] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> thats where they play melty blood in the off hours
[1:03:07] <+Diabetic> I left yesterday and he was looking at those guard bathrooms, good to be back lol
[1:03:16] <cap_bon> monster closet for when a hero comes by
[1:03:19] <ralphwiggum16> Are there any goblins in this game?
[1:03:22] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Challenge can you find the bathrooms?
[1:03:25] <heartlesshealer> That's an appreciated detail
[1:03:32] <+MeatBomb> I keep my turlets well guarded.
[1:03:34] <+Heart0fInk> They could have shitters in the guard posts. makes guarding easier.
[1:03:37] <+Freelance7> There's a lot of love in this demo
[1:03:41] <Coystick> Those pants look like they'd be comfy
[1:03:43] <+hgtarras> Are you getting this on ps4 or waiting until it’s on pc?
[1:03:52] <Burningskull01> i wonder how much stuff they will add between Kalm and the Chocobo Ranch
[1:03:56] <StaceMcGate> I want them balls
[1:03:58] <arkv01> no roll cancelling PunOko
[1:04:01] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I think it the original Avalanche's aim was to destroy the reactor, they just did not expect it to explode (Implying Jesse is not ready for this, which she demonstrates again with the security pass). I this i think their aim is to permanently deactivate it safely thanks to inside info, but Shinra make it explode
[1:04:02] <BurdRightsActivist> I WANT THOSE BALLS
[1:04:12] <+Risingxiv> Sounds like Baltheir's voice actore
[1:04:12] <arkv01> we're done wedge
[1:04:14] <Coystick> PlagueOfPre-Orders
[1:04:20] <Happy_Karl> Pre consumed product already eh?
[1:04:23] <+MeatBomb> Does Wedge even exist?
[1:04:23] <StaceMcGate> Does Cloud have spikey pubes?
[1:04:26] <arkv01> if anything wedge isn't FAT ENOUGH
[1:04:26] <+zaibatsu_member_333> he wouln't even be Biggs
[1:04:26] <+fingalights> He'd be Bishi bishi
[1:04:27] <zocano> probably like Badger
[1:04:28] <supersugoisenpai1> I bought the 1st Class edition like a crazy person
[1:04:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Maybe he's look like Barrett.
[1:04:39] <Victory_Boss> Smalls
[1:04:40] <cap_bon> That other guy is really handsome WTF
[1:04:42] <arkv01> hello jessie my eyes are up here
[1:04:45] <MattoBii> ribbon cables
[1:04:48] <+Neoripo> Serial cables
[1:04:56] <+fingalights> Well, it is like a 20's/80's world
[1:04:58] <Betofall> pata cable
[1:04:59] <+Neoripo> yeah
[1:05:00] <Coystick> Clicky clacky electronics are gone and sorely missed
[1:05:00] <StaceMcGate> Barret is glistening
[1:05:02] <arkv01> cereal cables for transferring breakfast
[1:05:04] <+Heart0fInk> He looks like the main character in a fat bastard hentais
[1:05:10] <ChibiChem> they are called "don´t stick your dick in it" cables, I have that on good authority
[1:05:10] <+Silurius> like SCSY?
[1:05:12] <殺害者> Tbh, I actually forgot this game was releasing until the demo dropped
[1:05:13] <nerdblase> 25 pin parallel.
[1:05:13] <WarchiefGoldva> There's something fascinating about "sci-fi" tech that looks like old-ass tech.
[1:05:15] <Triblade1992> The 90's design is REALLY sticking out
[1:05:17] <arkv01> wedge, I'll pay you
[1:05:20] <+hgtarras> I’m thinking of just waiting a year until it’s on Xbox and more “episodes” are out
[1:05:46] <arkv01> @hgtarras earliest 2022 for episode 2, and so on
[1:05:48] <殺害者> It seemed more like a meme than an actual thing when I first geard of an FF7 remake centuries ago
[1:05:53] <+thackattack00> Stories get a lot harder to write well the more advanced the tech is
[1:05:54] <StaceMcGate> I keep him fat so he can't run away from me
[1:05:54] <JoeBecomesJoe> Must protect his smile
[1:05:56] <+zaibatsu_member_333> o_0
[1:05:57] <Coystick> It's sucha nostaliga trip playing RE2make cuz of all the 90s in it and I never even played RE2
[1:06:01] <ChibiChem> he does look like he would be a feeder, yes
[1:06:01] <Happy_Karl> I got a buddy who looks like what Wedge would if he was thin.
[1:06:04] <+Heart0fInk> Wedge has cushin for the pushin
[1:06:05] <+Qsmash_> Wedge is sensitive despite being an eco terrorist
[1:06:07] <ScreamLord> But then with Cloud he's ready to explode at the slightest provocation LUL
[1:06:08] <+thackattack00> "Why couldn't this character just pull out a cellphone and solve the problem"
[1:06:15] <+fingalights> A little in screenshots.
[1:06:18] <Burningskull01> there are screenshots of the materia menus
[1:06:18] <+hgtarras> @arkv01 might as well wait for the year timed exclusive then.
[1:06:21] <cap_bon> Look at that fart gas
[1:06:23] <StaceMcGate> yup, weapon upgrading
[1:06:31] <+fingalights> YE, I like that
[1:06:33] <arkv01> uh what?
[1:06:35] <heartlesshealer> <3
[1:06:37] <JoeBecomesJoe> I like it
[1:06:37] <apolitenoob> No kidding? That sounds sick
[1:06:45] <vonmaultke> like the green dot in that sword right there
[1:06:47] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Like Rave Master Got it *wink*
[1:06:47] <StaceMcGate> each sword has a different ability attached, like KH3
[1:06:50] <ChibiChem> oh god, this is going to have a more convoluted upgrading system like demon souls?
[1:06:51] <+fingalights> They have different attacks too,
[1:06:53] <arkv01> they changed it to have spells bound to weapons?
[1:06:54] <Burningskull01> supposedly once you master the skill of the weapon you can use that skill on other weapons
[1:06:55] <mogode> masamune > everything
[1:06:55] <kentrix11> Yeah kinda like KH3 there's way to make older weapons relevant, I guess.
[1:07:02] <Coystick> Buster Sword best fits his character model why wouldn't you
[1:07:23] <StaceMcGate> SHOOT DOG
[1:07:26] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Because there are other Weapons Coy
[1:07:33] <kentrix11> @ChibiChem don't worry if it's like KH3 it's way more easy going.
[1:07:36] <arkv01> you (cannot) pet the dog in FF7R
[1:07:43] <mogode> playing this is 10000x better than watching it
[1:07:46] <apolitenoob> Bork: Busted
[1:07:48] <Betofall> nothin personnel pupper
[1:07:49] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Is that also why Cloud can swing around a 8x4 slab of metal with his toothpick arms?
[1:07:49] <Coystick> Other weapons a illegal
[1:07:50] <+Joeisyourhero> can any knowledgeable person in chat tell me, if I should buy a PS4 slim or Pro to play JUST this. I heard this game will be locked at 30 FPS, is that true?
[1:07:51] <殺害者> Plague, you gonna drop a Discord link at the end btw?
[1:07:57] <WarchiefGoldva> Those dogs look like Displacer Beasts from D&D.
[1:08:03] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> "Never doubted I could kick that dog's ass"
[1:08:04] <+fingalights> Baby Choco's
[1:08:11] <ChibiChem> @kentrix11 that´ s a bit reassuring
[1:08:12] <+MeatBomb> You can't have HORROR without COMMUNICATION provided by internet discourse. ISOLATION is classic horror.
[1:08:13] <locobo98> actual dog pets for combat
[1:08:14] <heartlesshealer> Oh, like that second Tales of Symphonia game?
[1:08:18] <Betofall> pretend your summons are pets
[1:08:20] <+fingalights> Use baby choco's as Bait
[1:08:25] <nerdblase> Disposable characters, like an Aeris then?
[1:08:32] <JoeBecomesJoe> @WarchiefGoldva They really do, just one tentacle missing
[1:08:35] <+fingalights> You have base ps4?
[1:08:46] <+Freelance7> I have base PS4, and it still runs pretty well
[1:08:50] <Explodincatz> everything needs to be PC first
[1:08:53] <ChibiChem> yeah, the PS4 on launch was a doggie doodoo
[1:09:06] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes This'll like be ported to PS5
[1:09:06] <Happy_Karl> This gets frame drops on my pro too.
[1:09:06] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> just gonna wait a year. Wish I had with XV
[1:09:07] <Coystick> You doubt console optimization
[1:09:07] <kentrix11> PS5 seems like it will run it great and it's backwards compatible so if you don't wanna doble dip that's a choice.
[1:09:11] <殺害者> I reckon FF7 remake will be finished once they're at the Ps9
[1:09:12] <+fingalights> I wish Square would push pc faster
[1:09:12] <Burningskull01> the only slow down i notice on my base ps4 is on ladders ><
[1:09:22] <mogode> this still looks amazing
[1:09:34] <+Joeisyourhero> can you imagine how F*cking sexy this game would be 144 FPS on 1080p with max settings on PC dafranYea
[1:09:34] <locobo98> were reaching a plato
[1:09:39] <cap_bon> Did FF7 have to do all kind of crazy shit like crash bandicoot to get all its shit on the screen?
[1:09:39] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also pc will likely run at 60frames
[1:09:43] <ChibiChem> the fan was shit, it overheated constantly, the memory capacity was shit and the controller cables were short as hell
[1:09:47] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> eventually, if not immediately
[1:10:07] <arkv01> WHOSSA GOODBOY, cmere for your reward Wowee
[1:10:19] <locobo98> i like the spartks
[1:10:22] <amused_platypus> plague in ff14 apple did a thing
[1:10:24] <+MeatBomb> Stop petting that puppy!
[1:10:25] <kentrix11> PS5 is said that it will sell at a lose to compete with microsoft like the ps3, since their digital services did so grat in ps4 they might actually do it, so good price for us.
[1:10:26] <+fingalights> I heard they were trying for 60, but couldn't get it stable so have it locked to 30
[1:10:36] <heartlesshealer> pet him with your sword
[1:10:40] <Burningskull01> in an interview they said don't expect any PS5 exculsivity for the remake cause the PS5 would be backwards compatible.
[1:10:41] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> itd never work at 60 so, yeah good idea
[1:10:55] <arkv01> @cap_bon nah, one of the advantages of being a slow turn based rpg with blocky ass character models and pre-rendered backgrounds
[1:10:57] <agadejobi> So little kids playing this are probably going grow up having a crush on Jessie b y the end of this
[1:11:07] <theloganbrand> Also the Tifa nude mod
[1:11:17] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> tifa physics mod
[1:11:18] <arkv01> why would you make tifa nude, gross
[1:11:19] <+Heart0fInk> And it'll have nude mods on PC!!
[1:11:22] <WarchiefGoldva> Tifa's Breasts Enlargement Mod
[1:11:24] <arkv01> tifa is HOT with clothes on
[1:11:25] <+fingalights> Communists Kappa
[1:11:29] <ChibiChem> since we are killing doggos, we can call it "the castrater"
[1:11:32] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> no, her hair physics
[1:11:34] <+Neoripo> The only game that didn't do that was Crysis
[1:11:38] <+Neoripo> and well

[1:11:42] <+Heart0fInk> I want a nude mod for Red13
[1:11:49] <SvenHolgersson> Why is that a hold button
[1:11:56] <+fingalights> Shaved Red would be horrifying

[1:12:05] <Burningskull01> pfft i'm 35 and had a crush on jessie at the end of the demo lol. they really did well with her character
[1:12:05] <codycurry52> Barret nude mods gonna be interesting

[1:12:15] <Chatterbox1991> Is Umatsu working on this?
[1:12:20] <Murphio_GS> No we're just animals
[1:12:22] <+fingalights> It's not right
[1:12:22] <+Neoripo> yes
[1:12:23] <殺害者> How many episodes is this game going to be by the end?
[1:12:24] <ChibiChem> a shaved bear would be hilarious
[1:12:24] <+Freelance7> @Chatterbox1991 Yes
[1:12:27] <+MeatBomb> Wedge disappeared!
[1:12:30] <agadejobi> I've seen a shaved bear
[1:12:31] <arkv01> fuck I wish we had persona style goof answers
[1:12:33] <agadejobi> They don't look great
[1:12:33] <+fingalights> Shaved bears are scary
[1:12:35] <+thackattack00> I wish I looked like a shaved animal
[1:12:36] <+Freelance7> Wedge is waiting at the bridge
[1:12:38] <Explodincatz> every time i look in a mirror
[1:12:42] <+thackattack00> instead I look like a silverback gorilla
[1:12:52] <heartlesshealer> her shape is armor
[1:12:55] <Animorphimagi> Draw some hairless animal women Plague
[1:12:55] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> she look slike iria
[1:12:58] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Featherless Owls look like alien monsters
[1:12:58] <+Neoripo> Uematsu composed the ending for this chapter and supervised the remake's OST
[1:13:02] <ChibiChem> boob armour tho
[1:13:05] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> iria from the zieram animation
[1:13:06] <NorthernDaddy> Why is Barret such an asshole in the remake
[1:13:07] <codycurry52> shes aerodynamic
[1:13:09] <heartlesshealer> yeah she looks great
[1:13:14] <Jimevera> scandalous

[1:13:27] <+MeatBomb> LEWD
[1:13:29] <+Heart0fInk> EXPOSED FLESH!!
[1:13:30] <Burningskull01> she also looks like she's wearing panties on the outside of her pants
[1:13:30] <arkv01> absolute succubus
[1:13:47] <WarchiefGoldva> I think that's an uzi in her hands.
[1:13:49] <Kaede_Viz> headband + ponytail band is a little weird to me. double head accessory
[1:13:54] <NorthernDaddy> Wait. Since when was Jessie a girl??????
[1:14:01] <ChibiChem> bra armour, because when you fight someone who wanna give them something to aim at
[1:14:02] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[1:14:03] <KaliasTV> Biggs got the same headband, same leg exposure
[1:14:03] <Sagacious7165> this game is phenominal
[1:14:07] <agadejobi> Oh man. People are not going to take what happens to AVALANCHE well, after this remake
[1:14:13] <Animorphimagi> Evalanche?
[1:14:14] <+jiggy_snipe> it's probably a "uniform"
[1:14:21] <+MeatBomb> You think Wedge designed the outfits?
[1:14:22] <codycurry52> blood in blood out
[1:14:24] <arkv01> red headband being the equivalent of red shirts
[1:14:25] <Sagacious7165> they did awesome with the remake... cant wait to see summons
[1:14:32] <ChibiChem> making it rain? who´ s stripping?
[1:14:35] <+not_crabby> yes
[1:14:36] <+fingalights> Yes
[1:14:39] <JoeBecomesJoe> Blind him with our tears men
[1:14:40] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> pc mods
[1:14:40] <Coystick> Funny that the Avelance palette is the same colour as the soldiers uniform/goggles
[1:14:44] <Explodincatz> hard murder
[1:14:45] <+jiggy_snipe> yes he's just Guts
[1:14:50] <NatetheHunter> Berserk level gore
[1:14:53] <BurdRightsActivist> Just watch Berserk for that shit
[1:14:53] <amused_platypus> blood mod wen
[1:14:54] <WarchiefGoldva> This place should've exploded in people chunks.
[1:14:56] <Triblade1992> It's a giant slab of metal Plague. It's basically Guts blade
[1:14:58] <kentrix11> It's fine they just go back to the lifestream.
[1:15:02] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I bet the leaders have of Avalanche also where Red head bands Leader Red Headbands
[1:15:04] <+SirGO0SE> she looks like she gives a very enthused blow job
[1:15:13] <agadejobi> Biggs looks like he's right out of Aliens
[1:15:14] <Jimevera> Sword is way too big for how its animated, lacks weight and impact imo
[1:15:18] <+fingalights> What?
[1:15:20] <heartlesshealer> They all have the exposed upper shins thing going on aside from Barret
[1:15:26] <Daxalog> I assume its mostly blunt damage cause of the magick armor. Your probably getting a nasty bruise at worse when your KO'd
[1:15:30] <JoeBecomesJoe> Just like how we trained you
[1:15:41] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:15:43] <ChibiChem> load a supersoaker up with piss, make it a golden supersoaker
[1:15:46] <+KR_Black> Is that how they trained Wang Lo ???
[1:15:48] <arkv01> yeah PUSH THAT BUTTON YOU MANSLUT
[1:15:48] <+zaibatsu_member_333> stop pushing her buttons!
[1:15:49] <+Heart0fInk> Mmmm Tight security
[1:15:49] <+fingalights> Sploosh
[1:15:50] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> typ ein g_saberrealisticcombat 3
[1:15:51] <Burningskull01> she want's you to puhs her button
[1:15:51] <+SirGO0SE> omg he did itttt im gonna splooo
[1:15:52] <Coystick> The button is yonic imagery for clit
[1:15:54] <cap_bon> infect your goons with blood based shit so when the hero bisects them he gets infect
[1:15:54] <Happy_Karl> I look at Jessie's face and all I see Is Claire from the old Resident Evils.
[1:15:56] <codycurry52> sheAhoe
[1:15:57] <agadejobi> She's testing them waters
[1:15:58] <BurdRightsActivist> I wish he would push MY BUTTONS TOO
[1:15:58] <DaKnightWarrior> lytCANDY
[1:16:01] <Betofall> my exact reaction when girls talk to ne
[1:16:02] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Rememeber!
[1:16:03] <+Diabetic> "Step on my fingers you spiky haired dong lord"
[1:16:04] <amused_platypus> shes into tifa?
[1:16:10] <arkv01> tifa and I... we did it with our clothes on
[1:16:12] <Triblade1992> threeway
[1:16:12] <+Heart0fInk> Tifa pegs Cloud for sure
[1:16:18] <Madbearv> no, I played marvel instead
[1:16:22] <+zaibatsu_member_333> 1 an 1/2???
[1:16:28] <Coystick> Just joking haha
[1:16:30] <theloganbrand> Aerith pegs.
[1:16:31] <hatsaki92> i mean with that sword, one and a half isnt that unlikely
[1:16:31] <Coystick> haha
[1:16:34] <NatetheHunter> pvpFATTERZ
[1:16:39] <ChibiChem> @Madbearv if some twitter thots got what they want, yeah
[1:16:47] <+fingalights> Best boy
[1:16:47] <agadejobi> They did a good job fleshing out the rest of the gang though
[1:16:49] <arkv01> THEY HAD SECURITY CAMERAS through the entire reactor
[1:16:54] <+Diabetic> Jessie: "Circumsized or sportin a cap?"
[1:16:59] <Chatterbox1991> @PlagueOfGripes is it me or does Shinra look like Ted Turner?
[1:17:00] <arkv01> fucking weird fetish, prez shinra
[1:17:03] <heartlesshealer> so many lines for wandering into environmental hazards
[1:17:03] <Betofall> is heidegger going to punch his troops when hes angry like the original?
[1:17:05] <BurdRightsActivist> UNLESS..?
[1:17:07] <SuperVaderMan> haha just kidding... unless?
[1:17:08] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes do you think they are referring to the Sephiroth Clones when he is talking about "the attempt on President Shinra's life"?
[1:17:12] <+illoonar> LUL
[1:17:13] <+Diabetic> ...I thought it was "May-Ko"
[1:17:26] <Animorphimagi> Need to see sexy Rufus Shinra asap!
[1:17:26] <ChibiChem> oh god Barret´ s VA is terrible
[1:17:29] <+not_crabby> what if we had a threesome in the mako lake haha... unless 😳
[1:17:33] <+Neoripo> Barret has been hamed up, although i the original he was also very mad at first
[1:17:37] <JoeBecomesJoe> Thats how they got into this mess, they are all too awkward to say they dont want to blow the place up
[1:17:40] <+Heart0fInk> Mako is Aku. Don't @ me
[1:17:42] <Burningskull01> always said Mah-ko my self
[1:17:43] <red_blaster> Yeah, it's from Before Crisis
[1:17:50] <arkv01> remember BC is now playable!
[1:17:51] <+fingalights> Oh no,
[1:17:52] <fist_wizard_jay> Im glad they kept Barret acting like a batshit crazy old man
[1:17:52] <+jiggy_snipe> Barret has always been over the top
[1:17:54] <+SirGO0SE> avabranche
[1:17:57] <+reiface08> sounds terrible
[1:17:58] <+fingalights> Gact is cannon
[1:18:00] <agadejobi> I'm just really glad that the remake actually seems to remembered what the characters are like, unlike the post content
[1:18:01] <Betofall> please ignore we never see this movement in ff7
[1:18:06] <heartlesshealer> crisis core still canon
[1:18:07] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Thanks Crisis Core SeemsGood
[1:18:11] <agadejobi> No more HOLY MAIDEN CHOSEN BY HEAVEN Aeris
[1:18:12] <red_blaster> Yeah, and according to Before Crisis Avalanche was created by Rufus, which is lame.
[1:18:14] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> they have social media in this version
[1:18:14] <heartlesshealer> there's a poster for that Loveless play
[1:18:16] <nesbitt22> Barret: The Planet drying Brrrt
[1:18:17] <arkv01> oh man genesis shows up at the end of disc 1
[1:18:18] <+jiggy_snipe> Before Crisis Kappa
[1:18:24] <mexicansunglasses> The graphics and production value only highlight how laughable the writting is. JRPG's man LUL
[1:18:25] <Talionshadow1138> BRRT
[1:18:26] <+fingalights> i mean, power is kinda cool
[1:18:27] <agadejobi> Stop breaking the 4th wall Jessie
[1:18:31] <+Diabetic> I really hope that those sunglasses are for a tactical reason, otherwise Barrett must be LITERALLY blind."
[1:18:34] <+Freelance7> blud
[1:18:36] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Elii Nhooooooooo
[1:18:38] <+SirGO0SE> hehe
[1:18:40] <+zaibatsu_member_333> >:L
[1:18:41] <Betofall> its barret
[1:18:43] <+fingalights> Tehe
[1:18:44] <ChibiChem> that´ s probably just Barret
[1:18:46] <arkv01> jessie bangs dogs?
[1:18:49] <kentrix11> Some people do hate them though, namely the ones with reactors that exploded.
[1:18:50] <+SirGO0SE> brap
[1:18:53] <JoeBecomesJoe> Thats just Barrets musk
[1:18:54] <+Qsmash_> Did you ever see the upper plates with the rich people in the OG FF7?
[1:18:54] <Jimevera> Honestly i would resent avalanche for this bombing raid even without the giant explosion, just for all the people they kill
[1:18:58] <fist_wizard_jay> lol
[1:19:03] <heartlesshealer> Barret let his gun barrels overheat
[1:19:06] <+jiggy_snipe> hmmm
[1:19:08] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Do not tease the Bea
[1:19:11] <arkv01> ok I'm a little apprehensive about barrets portrait having the shades
[1:19:14] <arkv01> is he ever taking those off?
[1:19:16] <+SirGO0SE> is this dmc 2?
[1:19:30] <+Heart0fInk> She should have been in the Red13 breeding pen. just saying.
[1:19:32] <+jiggy_snipe> there's art without the shades so I hope he takes them off
[1:19:33] <+Neoripo> You only passed throu upper plate after bombing this in OG FF7
[1:19:40] <ChibiChem> god, I´ m just waiting for Barret to call Cloud a cracker
[1:19:43] <Murphio_GS> Berret is pretty hot isn't he?
[1:19:47] <agadejobi> Here's a joke I heard from Pat's channel: Jessie's such a thot, she got smashed by all of Sector Seven
[1:19:54] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @Heart0fInk Listen here buddy,
[1:20:01] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> eject oil pan
[1:20:04] <BurdRightsActivist> INITIATING MOISTURE
[1:20:10] <+Diabetic> Jessie: Have you ever heard of an eiffel tower? Me neither, unless...
[1:20:15] <WarchiefGoldva> Barret's looking like a daddy in this game. MY womb's coming down.
[1:20:19] <kentrix11> I do remember Max saying lock on had a few issues and he did tell the devs, so hopefully they ironed that out after making the demo.
[1:20:21] <+fingalights> Everyone is hot
[1:20:21] <+reiface08> even wedge?
[1:20:22] <arkv01> @agadejobi I'd believe it, but its more dark than funny
[1:20:25] <rcand9> barret is strong
[1:20:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> PunOko
[1:20:30] <+Freelance7> It's a Square Enix game, of course everyone is hot
[1:20:34] <+not_crabby> hes still a big fat moron
[1:20:35] <+fingalights> Palmer isn't hot
[1:20:36] <+Neoripo> Gyahahahaha
[1:20:41] <+reiface08> corneo isn't hot
[1:20:44] <$Rezca> why are the lasers timed?
[1:20:47] <heartlesshealer> being a bumbling idiot with the lasers gives you so many banter lines
[1:21:02] <WarchiefGoldva> Jessie talks mad shit if you walk into the lasers constantly. It's great.
[1:21:05] <+Qsmash_> wait til you see the crack whores in sector 75
[1:21:08] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes is this your first time playing the demo?
[1:21:09] <+Qsmash_> *5
[1:21:11] <+Diabetic> Jessie: Does it feel humid in here to you or is it just me? Oh, it's just ME!
[1:21:11] <cap_bon> Imagine your work place having fucking lasers just set up in the staff room that you have to navigate
[1:21:12] <agadejobi> Damn, why is Jessie so impressed with this guy
[1:21:13] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Don Corneo is always hot
[1:21:17] <arkv01> jessie is really objectifying cloud as a piece of meat
[1:21:23] <+not_crabby> its not cloud thats for sure
[1:21:26] <ChibiChem> god, that´ s patrenizing
[1:21:28] <Coystick> it's you, the player!
[1:21:29] <+reiface08> corneo
[1:21:29] <+ShinHadokenman> Jessie is the hottest fite me
[1:21:29] <agadejobi> Tifa looks amazing
[1:21:29] <+fingalights> Palmer
[1:21:30] <Betofall> we haven't seen cait sith yet
[1:21:32] <Burningskull01> Red XIII is the hottes... he's litterally on fire...

[1:21:41] <JoeBecomesJoe> Red13

[1:22:02] <arkv01> PALMER wins
[1:22:12] <+Punishedkaiger> Bungholio
[1:22:18] <ChibiChem> ED209?
[1:22:24] <+fingalights> Hojo gets all the ladies
[1:22:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> danny devito mod for corneo
[1:22:25] <WarchiefGoldva> But thanks to Corneo, we got a ton of Tifa doujins. Does that increase his value?
[1:22:27] <arkv01> cait sith is hot for sure
[1:22:31] <arkv01> luscious fur
[1:22:33] <+King_floppy> Vincent is gonna make me big NUT
[1:22:37] <+King_floppy> I just know it
[1:22:40] <Burningskull01> i kinda wish they would just remove cait sith
[1:22:46] <+King_floppy> ESPECIALLY flashback Turk Vincent
[1:22:50] <amused_platypus> what if they make it hot somehow D:
[1:22:58] <rcand9> we all know hell house is the hottest character
[1:22:58] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the same way he shows up in Dirge of Cerebus
[1:23:00] <agadejobi> I'd like to see to see the remake warm me up to Cait Sith, because I do not like this character at all
[1:23:02] <heartlesshealer> it's gonna be magical
[1:23:03] <+Qsmash_> it'll probably look as weird as the Moogles in this
[1:23:05] <somelurker> its gross
[1:23:06] <Coystick> It'll be fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[1:23:06] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> omit him entirely
[1:23:09] <Explodincatz> Joker from DMC3
[1:23:12] <+fingalights> Does he?
[1:23:14] <kentrix11> It will be a cartoon cat in top of a plushy. Since it was meant to be fake to begin with the can take some liberties.
[1:23:17] <DuoMaxwell64> I was never really feelin' Cait Sith
[1:23:19] <Betofall> they didn't even bother with the mog in advent children
[1:23:20] <Burningskull01> he's in the honey bee inn
[1:23:23] <ChibiChem> one word for Cait Sith, hot DP action
[1:23:23] <Burningskull01> but you can miss him
[1:23:37] <+fingalights> OH, yeah
[1:23:42] <heartlesshealer> yup
[1:23:48] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> Trade Cait Sith for Setzer
[1:24:03] <Burningskull01> @Betofall but put the mog doll for cait sith in the Advent children complete version... in the opening anyway
[1:24:04] <rcand9> cat shit is everyones least favourite team member
[1:24:17] <rcand9> THOUGH U FULLA SHIT
[1:24:23] <Explodincatz> its the best
[1:24:40] <Coystick> Honky cracker merc
[1:24:51] <+Qsmash_> "use magic" "this guy's a shit head"
[1:24:54] <Explodincatz> its player reminding and character lore in one
[1:24:56] <ChibiChem> wouldn´ t water be better to fuck up electricity tho?
[1:25:01] <rcand9> what a brave boy
[1:25:13] <+not_crabby> LUL
[1:25:14] <Burningskull01> wonder if they will give cloud a lighting wig if you do well at the squat mini game
[1:25:22] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> they just made barret like barret from final fantasy abridged
[1:25:23] <+Qsmash_> I like this interaction
[1:25:24] <Korgororo> jrpg blaxploitation Barret is SeemsGood
[1:25:27] <agadejobi> Cloud's been exposed as a big dork
[1:25:31] <$Rezca> oh shi- the cracks in the lies are forming
[1:25:31] <Daxalog> Wouldnt you be mad future you didnt give you lottery numbers?
[1:25:32] <DuoMaxwell64> I love Barret
[1:25:32] <Betofall> baby cloud
[1:25:32] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it was a good idea though
[1:25:32] <JoeBecomesJoe> Sick burn bro
[1:25:33] <kentrix11> I like the delivery in that "I uh"
[1:25:42] <theloganbrand> Hanging on the edge of tomorrow
[1:25:45] <codycurry52> Got'em
[1:25:47] <rcand9> barret is insane
[1:25:55] <LunarRemix> Maybe it makes more sense in japanese?
[1:25:58] <agadejobi> I thought the implication is that he's a clone or something
[1:25:59] <ChibiChem> Barret is drunk?
[1:26:03] <+Qsmash_> I guess he thinks they're test tube experiments
[1:26:05] <WarchiefGoldva> Maybe it's him doing a mockery?
[1:26:08] <sothatsprettybrutal> the Planet told him
[1:26:11] <Coystick> Barrett's had a big day man
[1:26:13] <DuoMaxwell64> I'm guessing Barrett is suggesting that SOLDIERS are artificial humans grown in a vat, I dunno
[1:26:15] <BurdRightsActivist> HANGING ON THE EDGE OF TOMORROW
[1:26:21] <Burningskull01> meaning that's hinting at Soldier's beeing genetically modified?
[1:26:23] <DaKnightWarrior> Barret is trying to be mean to cloud...i think.
[1:26:25] <Burningskull01> maybe*
[1:26:29] <codycurry52> He has to get plastered before the missions
[1:26:34] <+Heart0fInk> Yes. My mom..
[1:26:34] <Betofall> i'm quite sure you're insanse when you graft a gun to your arm in response to your village burning
[1:26:38] <Coystick> I have a friend like that and it hurts but I like him.
[1:26:43] <ChibiChem> I would expect them to burst out laughing afterwards tho
[1:26:56] <amused_platypus> @Betofall thats the most sane thing to do
[1:26:58] <Deimos002> Yeah, people do that to me all the time Jebaited
[1:26:59] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I just avoid mirrors now
[1:27:00] <Explodincatz> he has to double down
[1:27:03] <+fingalights> Welp, that's me
[1:27:07] <LunarRemix> A guy on the supermarket once told me out of nowhere that he was buying a Funnel to feed his wife milkies.
[1:27:14] <Solokaldaka> poordeHey woopsHey chat
[1:27:16] <zk_nails> now he just needs to say "Hanging on the edge of tomorrow."
[1:27:18] <+fingalights> That makes scense
[1:27:36] <ChibiChem> he´ s an all-out, balls out introvert at joking
[1:27:39] <+crown_clown22> Barret is big teddy bear who is acting tough because he is hurt deep inside with his past

[1:29:07] <ChibiChem> @twohitgood that makes me laugh more than it should XD
[1:29:11] <Deimos002> No way, fam
[1:29:13] <kentrix11> On the plus side it's a nice tell so you don't forget.
[1:29:17] <codycurry52> Sex should include more wrestling moves
[1:29:20] <nesbitt22> LIVE AND LEARN Hanging on the Edge of Tomorrow
[1:29:26] <kentrix11> On the not plus side it can get a bit annooying.
[1:29:30] <+Heart0fInk> Jessie stop fucking yourself with that all materia
[1:29:34] <ChibiChem> when the Heartbreak Kid became the Neckbreak Kid
[1:29:41] <+fingalights> Dyne loved the Coal
[1:29:49] <Burningskull01> it's funny how cloud says "no the pump would suck us back up" yet that didn't happen with Sephiroth ><
[1:30:00] <Zjay87> lol
[1:30:02] <codycurry52> Girl Ima give a vertebreaker
[1:30:05] <Happy_Karl> I love you drug.
[1:30:12] <WarchiefGoldva> To be fair, maybe Barret DID need drug for the gun. I mean, morphine is technically a drug.
[1:30:20] <theloganbrand> Barret is getting off on this
[1:30:26] <+Heart0fInk> So is FF7 set on an alternate earth or...?
[1:30:36] <BurdRightsActivist> monkaS
[1:30:37] <ChibiChem> @theloganbrand wouldn´ t you?
[1:30:39] <+fingalights> 3-5 years right? Cause how ever old Marline is right?
[1:30:47] <+Neoripo> Aaaand banned from youtube Kappa
[1:30:50] <elsdragon007> I might be wrong.. but I think this might ne a boss room....
[1:30:50] <Burningskull01> @Heart0fInk alternate universe technially
[1:30:57] <$Rezca> what's a stamp?
[1:31:11] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> his intense aura of anger burns them off
[1:31:12] <LunarRemix> The explosion of the second reactor
[1:31:16] <Betofall> jumping off the bridge into the overworld?
[1:31:16] <+fingalights> He takes them off to wipe a single tear
[1:31:18] <+Freelance7> @Rezca A fictional dog from a show or movie in the game's universe
[1:31:18] <BurdRightsActivist> @Rezca Stampy is like an in-universe propoganda from SOLDIER about a little Dog named Stampy
[1:31:18] <LunarRemix> The scene when he's shooting the gate.
[1:31:25] <+game_imp> stamp is a dog
[1:31:28] <+Freelance7> Or what Burd said
[1:31:29] <agadejobi> Stamp is a children's book character in this game
[1:31:35] <agadejobi> It's on one of thoe posters
[1:31:37] <s1rcuit> Stamp apparently is a Shinra mascot comic of a dog
[1:31:39] <kentrix11> @Rezca In the demo you can see some posters for it, it's a tv show about a dog, Barret probably watches it with his daughter, which a superb detail.
[1:31:46] <+Shindeil> @heart0fink They call it “the Planet” and “Gaia” in the original, IIRC.
[1:31:52] <+Neoripo> I miss the 1997 on the pipes
[1:31:54] <MattoBii> there's a poster with Stamp on it somewhere early on in the demo
[1:32:03] <Happy_Karl> I'm kinda surprised they didn't put some sort of hook thing on Cloud's back for his sword. Just floats there.
[1:32:07] <$VoxFoxWatch> I want to make a ff7 parody quote. It would be funny for how dramatic Barret is.
[1:32:12] <codycurry52> he callled you a pussy
[1:32:14] <+fingalights> Enough time for ya
[1:32:18] <Burningskull01> @PlagueOfGripes if you pick 30 he just says "that enough time for ya"
[1:32:23] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> "You kno wthat thing explodews, right?"
[1:32:30] <superspartaxyZED> What?
[1:32:40] <elsdragon007> a REAL MAN can do this in 5 mins...
[1:32:41] <ChibiChem> it really HAS a butthole!
[1:32:43] <+fingalights> The robot is mad cause of hemorrhoids
[1:32:51] <ChibiChem> now I can´ t unsee it!
[1:32:55] <rcand9> the mech scorpion is very shy about it's butthole
[1:32:56] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> all robots have buttholes in the future
[1:32:58] <+Deft_Thought> Can cloud use his counter against the missiles?
[1:32:59] <$VoxFoxWatch> @chibichem LET THE PERVY FANART COMMENCE!
[1:33:03] <+Heart0fInk> Jessie is jilling off to it's red glowing butthole
[1:33:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:33:19] <superspartaxyZED> omg I SAW IT
[1:33:23] <+fingalights> Only melee attacks can be countered
[1:33:24] <+themightiestmonarch> the robot is angry because it poops missles
[1:33:48] <$Rezca> one step away from Muh Planet
[1:33:53] <kentrix11> Steelskin is pretty good here since you can just tank the missiles.
[1:33:54] <+MeatBomb> My hemorrhoids glow like that. Needed two mirrors, and a bold can do attitude.
[1:34:00] <cheerioohs> b-but the planet... we get it barret
[1:34:08] <kentrix11> Also I might sugest hititng the legs to stun it.
[1:34:18] <ChibiChem> wait, shouldn´ t the timer be running while this fight is now?'
[1:34:23] <+SirGO0SE> @MeatBomb what a soldier
[1:34:36] <Happy_Karl> Doesn't the lock on always go for who you're controlling?
[1:34:38] <+themightiestmonarch> if Barrett was so concerned about the planet wouldn't he not use materia? Kappa
[1:34:44] <superspartaxyZED> uh oh
[1:34:48] <ChibiChem> ..... I got nothing
[1:34:52] <$VoxFoxWatch> @chibichem He didn’t get to hit the button, he was about to, then the robot with the blowing bunghole came in.
[1:34:53] <Explodincatz> Barret reminds me of Beat from TWEWY
[1:34:53] <AnacondaVirtue> Give it the Ol' Spicy Butthole, Plague
[1:34:56] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> usually lightning magic
[1:35:01] <DaKnightWarrior> Fire in the hole
[1:35:04] <rcand9> spicy buthole is a status effect
[1:35:29] <$VoxFoxWatch> LET THE FANART COMMENCE OF THE SCORPION ROBOT AND ITS GLOWING BUTTHOLE!
[1:35:40] <+themightiestmonarch> Mr Spicy Butthole is the evil twin of Mr Poopy Butthole
[1:35:47] <+MeatBomb> This fight reminds me that I just had Taco Bell....
[1:36:07] <+fingalights> there kind of is
[1:36:08] <+Neoripo> Orange FF14 AoE
[1:36:26] <Jigokuro> bitterLOL
[1:36:32] <JoeBecomesJoe> I hope we get a cool cross over event for this on ff14
[1:36:46] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> It's basically a monster hunter enemy
[1:36:52] <+themightiestmonarch> I hope they have a boss rush mode at gold saucer so Tifa can kick the robot in it's glowing butthole
[1:36:54] <WarchiefGoldva> Do you think it's possible to Counter-attack the boss' melee hits with Cloud?
[1:37:05] <$VoxFoxWatch> Jeeze barret. Language.
[1:37:08] <+MeatBomb> You stubborn PIZZA shit. I know the feel.
[1:37:21] <ChibiChem> I think the question is, can you counter-attack the butthole?
[1:37:30] <arkv01> dont get hit dummy
[1:37:32] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> maybe they cleaned it up 3 months after
[1:37:42] <+Cook_4_Souls> Hey plague
[1:37:47] <kentrix11> You can just shoot it while it does it's laser.
[1:37:52] <rcand9> you could counter attack the butstomps in punisher mode before stage 3
[1:37:59] <arkv01> are there demo speedruns up yet?
[1:38:15] <arkv01> how fast are people dunking on scorpion guard?
[1:38:20] <+Deft_Thought> I guess the telegraphing for attacks is through the move notifications on the UI
[1:38:29] <Explodincatz> who cares about speedruns
[1:38:30] <Burningskull01> to dodge electromagnetic field you have to be watching the move name above the bosses name
[1:38:34] <+MeatBomb> Despite watching Plague play, I'm still having trouble believing this game is actually coming out...
[1:38:43] <+Deft_Thought> But it'd be better to telegraph moves with a longer visual
[1:38:44] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> yeah it just says above the enemy what its doing if its scanned
[1:38:50] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> or maybe if its not even
[1:39:01] <+themightiestmonarch> this game and r3make are coming out a week apart
[1:39:13] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> yeah but doom though
[1:39:18] <arkv01> like RE is big but capcom maybe don't fuk wit ff7
[1:39:28] <+Deft_Thought> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah
[1:39:39] <+Deft_Thought> It's a weird middle ground they're striking, design wise
[1:39:57] <+themightiestmonarch> I'm taking the day off for this so I can have a 3 day weekend to play
[1:39:59] <Burningskull01> i just wish guarding and doging had priorty and would cancel your attack animations
[1:40:01] <+MeatBomb> Imagine if this remake team gets their hands on a GOOD Final Fantasy. Kappa
[1:40:20] <+Deft_Thought> So is the stagger a timer with a damage threshold?
[1:40:20] <+themightiestmonarch> I want ff6 remake next plz thx
[1:40:30] <+fingalights> May just have to block on that
[1:40:32] <+Deft_Thought> Looks like hitting it while its staggered makes the bar drop faster
[1:40:36] <kentrix11> This is kinda weird cause there are tells but usually just reading the text works better cause attacks are too quick.
[1:40:39] <skleido> we'll get a ff9 remake around 2030
[1:40:42] <DaKnightWarrior> ff6 is amazing
[1:40:42] <+themightiestmonarch> but they're probably going to do 8
[1:40:47] <rcand9> 6 doesn't need a remake its perfect
[1:40:55] <ralphwiggum16> This game is so '90s it hurts
[1:40:57] <Burningskull01> stagger is a meter you build up and when it triggers it drains to let you do more damage during that draining period
[1:40:59] <+themightiestmonarch> I want one anyways Kappa
[1:40:59] <kentrix11> I like how the music climaxes here.
[1:41:02] <+Deft_Thought> They just need to remake Zidane grabbing Garnet's ass
[1:41:04] <+Deft_Thought> Nothing else matters
[1:41:06] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> remake ehrgiez like this
[1:41:09] <ralphwiggum16> This is even more '90s than RE2
[1:41:10] <s1rcuit> idk who this dev team is, but they're doing a great job so far
[1:41:12] <+SirGO0SE> i want new games with new plots and new mechanics t.t
[1:41:17] <+themightiestmonarch> remake einhander KappaPride
[1:41:26] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> they did in kingdom hearts 3
[1:41:28] <+themightiestmonarch> threads of fate remake
[1:41:28] <WarchiefGoldva> Flashy finish!
[1:41:30] <kentrix11> Stylish finish
[1:41:44] <ralphwiggum16> you are a good boy, Plague.
[1:41:52] <King_thunder365> You did the big finish
[1:41:53] <+themightiestmonarch> vagrant story would be cool af to see remade all kidding aside
[1:42:00] <+SirGO0SE> LUL
[1:42:01] <Burningskull01> i'll be honest... i waste my limit when he staggers.
[1:42:03] <+fingalights> was the bomb even necessary after that
[1:42:08] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the gummi ship parts were by the einhander team, and you could even make the same ship, and fight einhander bosses
[1:42:09] <JoeBecomesJoe> It's a bit long
[1:42:19] <kentrix11> It's a bit too long and some attacks are a bit unforgiving.
[1:42:19] <arkv01> the absolute state of gaming journalism
[1:42:20] <superspartaxyZED> it did take a while
[1:42:27] <s1rcuit> the mako for some reason seems to me like it'd be super flammable
[1:42:34] <+Heart0fInk> Reviewers complaining? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:42:35] <ChibiChem> video game journos
[1:42:37] <arkv01> ah yes the mythical "centrist" LUL
[1:42:45] <+Deft_Thought> There's no such thing as a middle ground, fuck yooooou
[1:42:46] <+aqua_mashu> Once you know the weaknesses it’s pretty fast
[1:43:02] <+Neoripo> Just DO the mechanics
[1:43:03] <+Deft_Thought> Souls games either need an easy mode or you can die
[1:43:10] <+HistorysGr8estMonster> "secret" pervert.
[1:43:19] <skleido> it's a little long. Perhaps you'll be able to grind a little before fighting it in the final product
[1:43:26] <kentrix11> It's a demo so it kinda can't be helped with giving you little time.
[1:43:27] <rcand9> its a big up tick in difficulty of course
[1:43:39] <+SirGO0SE> if its too hard for you --> it not for you
[1:43:46] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> it might be built with speedrunning in mind
[1:43:50] <+jiggy_snipe> yea it's a boss Kappa
[1:43:51] <TalkingObject> "boss is hard"
[1:44:06] <Kaede_Viz> Classic mode is journalist mode
[1:44:08] <+themightiestmonarch> I figured out Cloud gets berserk after landing the hold down attack in punisher mode in two encounters and was like "oh that's useful"
[1:44:09] <ChibiChem> it´ s called strategies
[1:44:09] <TalkingObject> isn't that the point?
[1:44:17] <ralphwiggum16> they should've thrown in some goblins to get the player into it
[1:44:25] <arkv01> is there an option to just leave jessie?
[1:44:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> dont think its gonna be much longer int he game it self
[1:44:32] <+Doc1790> Time has stopped during cutscenes
[1:44:41] <arkv01> leave the thirsty wench to her fate
[1:44:41] <rcand9> difficulty doesn't have to be a steady incline id argue, spikes are reasonable.
[1:44:45] <ThirdPersonPhil> it feels like they are rushing to get to a more open part of the game
[1:44:46] <ralphwiggum16> no, Plague they have to be goblins.
[1:44:54] <+Heart0fInk> See? You did help get Jessie's rocks off... her.
[1:44:56] <skleido> Heard the air buster is crazy difficult. You need to nerf it prior to the battle, otherwise it's near impossible to beat
[1:44:59] <Zebroneath> Fighting two Sweepers at once would have been a nice lead in.
[1:45:07] <+fingalights> I guess the demo kinda helps with that
[1:45:10] <+AbnormalVoid> SNIIIIIFFFF
[1:45:10] <superspartaxyZED> nice.

[1:45:14] <+SirGO0SE> BRAP
[1:45:17] <+Neoripo> They should add an enemy that forces the use of magic
[1:45:17] <+SirGO0SE> brraaaaaap
[1:45:22] <+Deft_Thought> MAKO FLUIDS
[1:45:23] <+themightiestmonarch> I wanna see how they're going to handle the elevator fight at shinra tower

Look out, took out, book out, winge. Won’t be surprised if people make Scorpion robot glowing butthole NSFW art CRINGE. Not gonna lie, wanted to make that joke when everyone was saying it and was coming up with the words when you beat that thing in record time. Love it when your rare streams come on.
[1:45:38] <+Neoripo> A lot of streamers i have seen NEVER using magic
[1:45:39] <Mister_McDerp> it can be both
[1:45:42] <WarchiefGoldva> Since this game has an attack button, I've seen people barely use skills at all.
[1:45:42] <Coystick> SNIIIIIFFFFFFF
[1:45:45] <powerlessimp0> he got soulja boy wit him
[1:45:46] <MattoBii> who's in the mood for omelettes
[1:45:46] <ChibiChem> Taco Bell
[1:45:49] <+themightiestmonarch> and I -REALLY- wanna see how they're going to handle the missing number fight in shinra mansion
[1:45:52] <superspartaxyZED> ovulation you say?!
[1:45:53] <$Rezca> the smell of ovulation
[1:45:57] <Burningskull01> to be honest there is very little mp to make a enemy that forces magic
[1:46:06] <amused_platypus> i louve all these soulja boy references
[1:46:15] <DaKnightWarrior> Crank Dat Cloud
[1:46:18] <superspartaxyZED> thats how long the fight was lmao
[1:46:25] <+AbnormalVoid> I kinda wish the telegraphing messages for enemy attacks were larger and not a tiny message above their health bar, which you may or may not be looking at
[1:46:25] <ChibiChem> you assume ovulation and taco bell ain´ t the same thing?
[1:46:26] <elsdragon007> LUL
[1:46:41] <VoxFoxWatch> I’m a fool, I know.
[1:46:44] <rcand9> anal ovulation

[1:47:06] <+fingalights> I like em when they stay still
[1:47:11] <schmoopen> nigga
[1:47:12] <powerlessimp0> gotta say that transition between party members is kinda jarring
[1:47:14] <+themightiestmonarch> crank dat focused thrust
[1:47:14] <Coystick> nice
[1:47:15] <+AbnormalVoid> his FAT DICK
[1:47:16] <Mr_Strut> bullet
[1:47:19] <rcand9> his gunarm
[1:47:20] <+not_crabby> gun
[1:47:20] <DaKnightWarrior> :)
[1:47:21] <+Neoripo> Boolets
[1:47:22] <arkv01> his bullet pinecones
[1:47:27] <WarchiefGoldva> When the game's like "USE SKILLS, IDIOT" and journalists are like, "game's too hard", it makes me tilt my head like I'm witnessing something magical.
[1:47:37] <Burningskull01> it doesn't if you do it right....
[1:47:37] <superspartaxyZED> you know what plague, you know what.
[1:47:46] <CirclesForever> adumN1 adumN2
[1:47:48] <Burningskull01> not that i menat that to sound bad
[1:47:53] <SammySe7en> Your comedic skills are the only reason I'm watching this, I really dislike FF7
[1:47:57] <+MeatBomb> Barret has a potty mouth.
[1:48:17] <+themightiestmonarch> re3 demo tomorrow plz Capcom
[1:48:26] <ChibiChem> Barret´ s using his pronouns
[1:48:45] <+AbnormalVoid> I love Barret being a dork, it's perfect
[1:48:46] <rcand9> shinra bulletproof shelf tech
[1:48:52] <Mr_Strut> Environment geometry is always hilarious
[1:49:07] <+themightiestmonarch> I hope the demo ends with an unwinnable nemesis encounter you can't escape from and all you can do is die and then it's like buy game now
[1:49:09] <+MeatBomb> Brave Fencer Mushashi remake please, Bliz.
[1:49:24] <+themightiestmonarch> they did that on PS2 Kappa
[1:49:26] <theloganbrand> FF XII was the same away
[1:49:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> it becomes the optimal way
[1:49:37] <laserbeaming> How many apples can you eat in stopped time?
[1:49:37] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> I got nothing to do with that man
[1:49:38] <superspartaxyZED> a potion cooldown would probably solve that issue
[1:49:41] <skleido> it breaks the immersion if you have to heal from the menu
[1:49:42] <+Neoripo> It breaks difficulty
[1:49:45] <rcand9> punisher modes counter eats shocktroopers up
[1:49:47] <+fingalights> Dumb apples
[1:49:50] <kentrix11> Punisher mode is fun against those enemies.
[1:49:52] <Mr_Strut> Hardly seems like an exploit if it's outside of battle
[1:50:03] <+bigmogame> I support a Brave Fencer Musashi remake, but only if it comes with a demo of Final Fantasy 8 Remake
[1:50:03] <+themightiestmonarch> punisher mode is fun
[1:50:08] <+ShinHadokenman> it wouls be nice if the demo had a free roam mode for funs
[1:50:10] <ralphwiggum16> I miss "da na na na na, nuh na, na na naaaaa
[1:50:10] <+bigmogame> You know.. for the complete experience
[1:50:12] <+vandesdelca0> it's fine as long as it's out of combat healing
[1:50:12] <skleido> no reaching lvl 99 at bombing mission this time
[1:50:31] <+AbnormalVoid> I wish non-controlled allies' AI was more configurable
[1:50:43] <+AbnormalVoid> hopefully that'll be in the full version
[1:50:57] <+themightiestmonarch> maybe they'll put in gambits KappaPride
[1:51:00] <JoeBecomesJoe> Like the gambits in ff12
[1:51:01] <DaKnightWarrior> great demo
[1:51:02] <+AbnormalVoid> yeeeaaahhh
[1:51:03] <JoeBecomesJoe> Yeah
[1:51:11] <rcand9> I cant wairt
[1:51:16] <+fingalights> Think about the final boss in the final game
[1:51:23] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> what if they let you use EVERY party member at once
[1:51:26] <amused_platypus> big brain meter will be expended
[1:51:27] <rcand9> my tiny brain is up to the challenge
[1:51:32] <rcand9> shut up tho
[1:51:33] <Betofall> they seemed to allow them blowing up the stupid reactor
[1:51:36] <yoyoyoseph> All acorrding to kinkaku
[1:51:36] <%JJCheeker> howdy bitterAyy
[1:51:37] <Coystick> BoomerOfGripes
[1:51:38] <LunarRemix> Nah I think the RPG mechanics will just allow you to costumize a character to be more of a generalist
[1:51:39] <ralphwiggum16> there really are not enough goblins in this game
[1:51:42] <+AbnormalVoid> it's one of the many issues with this change to the plot
[1:51:50] <+Neoripo> They might be useful to pin more shit on them later
[1:51:52] <Mr_Strut> Maybe Shinra was just planning to lie, but Avalanche happened to be there anyway.
[1:51:53] <+AbnormalVoid> it pisses me off
[1:51:54] <skleido> I feel the AI was configured that way to force players to cycle through all characters more frequently. But ATB charges faster as levels increase I think
[1:51:57] <rcand9> midgar need an enemey
[1:52:00] <+fingalights> It would have been simpler if this was a fuck up on Avalanche
[1:52:03] <superspartaxyZED> barret hates elevators too it seems
[1:52:06] <arkv01> japanese logic baby
[1:52:07] <+MeatBomb> They always wanna blame a black man.
[1:52:13] <+kegkilla187> what was changed
[1:52:14] <kentrix11> I wonder if it will tie into the wutai plot line they are setting up.
[1:52:16] <+Doc1790> I want to live out my terrorist fantasies in this game.
[1:52:18] <ralphwiggum16> but they're cool terrorists
[1:52:21] <powerlessimp0> well ... yes
[1:52:25] <superspartaxyZED> Id be down for that.
[1:52:26] <@Nightbot> @SirGO0SE -> cmonBruh [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:52:27] <rcand9> hey dont do alan more like that
[1:52:27] <+AbnormalVoid> probably mostly due to them struggling to stretch out a 6 hour area into a 40 hour game
[1:52:28] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes I think Shinra's goal was to eliminate the slums for new projects and blame Avalanche
[1:52:28] <+BubbaRands> I mean if there
[1:52:29] <arkv01> jessie welcomes the tentacle gods
[1:52:34] <+RayDaug> Because you can't play as bad people in a major Japanese RPG
[1:52:37] <+vandesdelca0> I mean it was the 90s
[1:52:37] <TheAsylumCat> freedom fighters not terrorists Kappa
[1:52:40] <SammySe7en> Bubasti was great
[1:52:45] <ralphwiggum16> Bubastis was old, man
[1:52:46] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> there was no other way plague, he needed the bait
[1:52:46] <+BubbaRands> I mean if there's enough tentacles...
[1:52:49] <Burningskull01> i wont forgive how boring the Watchmen was
[1:52:51] <ralphwiggum16> she lived a long life
[1:52:54] <+bigmogame> Shinra and Ozymandias are basically the same person.
[1:53:12] <+SirGO0SE> i liek big plots
[1:53:13] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> the only thing manhatten ever cared about was funny cat videos from the future
[1:53:15] <TheAsylumCat> mind you this was before 911 it didn't have the impact then like it would now
[1:53:21] <+fingalights> It may all come together, but idk
[1:53:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:53:22] <arkv01> I mean theres a lot less need to retcon out atrocities after midgar
[1:53:25] <skleido> in the original it jessie clearly says the explosion shouldn't have been that large
[1:53:35] <theloganbrand> Looking forward to the Don Corneo dick sucking minigame
[1:53:43] <+AbnormalVoid> It would have been better if they just kept a sensible scope and made the game a proper remake instead of a reimagining
[1:53:49] <+SirGO0SE> same
[1:53:56] <superspartaxyZED> is this the end?
[1:54:02] <$studleydoorite> Cheer100 good luck on this boss fight
[1:54:09] <rcand9> flower cloud is best cloud
[1:54:10] <arkv01> rest of midgar looks A
[1:54:16] <+fingalights> I think they had the scenario writers of the og
[1:54:20] <powerlessimp0> well that's definitely going to happen
[1:54:22] <arkv01> I need DLC that lets me dress up cloud as lightning for corneo
[1:54:31] <arkv01> and just black the screen out as corneo fucks cloud
[1:54:32] <ralphwiggum16> Plague tell us more stories
[1:54:32] <kentrix11> That will be a DLC for the final game and you will get to use 6 swords at the same time.
[1:54:35] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> that guy looks strong
[1:54:38] <FennecZephyr> Can't you already fight in the sky?
[1:54:41] <+fingalights> Ew
[1:54:42] <superspartaxyZED> who?
[1:54:43] <+CutsAknife> maybe they might add some kind of hotbar that has quick-actions for each party member
[1:54:43] <ralphwiggum16> say one of your catchphrases!
[1:54:44] <+fingalights> Gross
[1:54:44] <VoxFoxWatch> Cheer100 Cheer100 good thing you’re not fighting that one robot with the fire-tiger-wolf and the cleric. To quote my favorite FF7 parody line: Barret “Now I don’t know what battle experience y’all have, but just follow my lead” (shoots the robot, doing some damage) “there, not you try something!” Tiger-Wolf “I’lL cAsT fIrE!” (Does minimal damage) Barret “FIRE DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO ROBOTS.” Cleric “I’ll try something!” (Heals robot) (Barret screams in anger.)
[1:54:44] <+SirGO0SE> i just want cloud to be a pretty little girl
[1:54:47] <MattoBii> what a sellout
[1:54:50] <Mr_Strut> What a loser
[1:54:51] <+vandesdelca0> I kinda wish this combat system was just used for a new game
[1:54:53] <laserbeaming> Pat be Shilling
[1:54:53] <studleydoorite> when are you going to settle down and become a shill, Plague?
[1:54:56] <WarchiefGoldva> diRTy shilL
[1:54:58] <arkv01> cmon plague you know pat will fuck anyone for money uh I mean play anything
[1:55:05] <JoeBecomesJoe> I hope that flower on cloud is like the kick me sign from God Hand and the game will have flowr runs
[1:55:06] <rcand9> spill wants that dirty money good for him
[1:55:08] <skleido> check out the new gameplay with the air buster
[1:55:13] <+BubbaRands> Gotta fund that redbull somehow
[1:55:16] <skleido> it's dope
[1:55:34] <ralphwiggum16> the kick-me sign challenge is absurd
[1:55:34] <%Samex_Comex> He needs to buy more fidget spinners
[1:55:36] <Stillchr> FF7 Machinma
[1:55:41] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> probably final fantasy abridged
[1:55:44] <+AbnormalVoid> Team Foreskin
[1:55:50] <laserbeaming> Yeah, it's the Team Four Star one
[1:55:53] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes The only change i really don't like is that in the OG Aeris was a Tomboy(ish) and Tifa was more girlish in contrast with their fighting style. I this they seem to have gone the stereotype route
[1:55:54] <+AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[1:55:54] <arkv01> TFS gonna need to finish up the rest of their series before april LUL
[1:55:55] <+not_crabby> PLAY AGANE
[1:55:55] <VoxFoxWatch> TFS.
[1:55:58] <ralphwiggum16> Final Fantasy House When?
[1:55:59] <Zjay87> one more time
[1:56:01] <superspartaxyZED> do whatever you want
[1:56:08] <heartlesshealer> dump on Pat's stream whenever you do finish
[1:56:12] <skleido> watch the Air Buster gameplay, and then play again
[1:56:14] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> see, aeris is cleric
[1:56:17] <arkv01> I think you're good on the playthroughs fam, now play original FF7 midgar section
[1:56:24] <Jigokuro> Send us all to Franz, he'd shit his pants @PlagueOfGripes
[1:56:29] <VoxFoxWatch> @big_bang_biitz I could not remember her name.
[1:56:30] <hatsaki92> wasnt she supposed to be a geomancer? whatever thats supposed to be
[1:56:34] <+AbnormalVoid> gotta go fast
[1:56:36] <arkv01> yeye speedrun mode
[1:56:36] <WarchiefGoldva> SpeedPlague
[1:56:36] <laserbeaming> Speedrun!
[1:56:39] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> its aerith
[1:56:51] <+MeatBomb> gdqWingLeft gdqSanic gdqWingRight
[1:56:56] <superspartaxyZED> oh?
[1:56:57] <arkv01> yeah aeris fucks... dogs
[1:56:57] <+AbnormalVoid> you mean Jessie?
[1:56:58] <theloganbrand> Aerith pegs
[1:56:59] <rcand9> she's also a bit of a literal god
[1:57:00] <+fingalights> Yeah she does, you think she makes money on just flowers
[1:57:11] <+Doc1790> AERITH FUCKS
[1:57:12] <kentrix11> I mean you can just let her fight on her own and she can just beat the shinra soldiers on her own.
[1:57:13] <%JJCheeker> She bangs she bangs
[1:57:20] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:57:23] <superspartaxyZED> ohhhh?
[1:57:24] <%Samex_Comex> plagueGripes
[1:57:28] <+treemanfour> Consenting Dog
[1:57:31] <Mr_Strut> So she fucks dog?
[1:57:35] <laserbeaming> Something Something Harkness Test
[1:57:35] <+Neoripo> She lives in the slums, defeating mutants all day on her way to take care of the church flowers
[1:57:36] <kentrix11> There's that one part were tseng defeats her but your whoe party has troubles with Reno alone so it makes sense she would lose there.
[1:57:37] <arkv01> red xiii don't want NONE of that human puss
[1:57:38] <+AbnormalVoid> she visits Red Rocket Town
[1:57:41] <LunarRemix> Yeah she fucks Cloud with strap-ons
[1:57:43] <Mr_Strut> Dog singular
[1:57:47] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> hm
[1:57:49] <JoeBecomesJoe> The dogs have to be smart enough to understand it's wrong, thats what does it for her
[1:57:51] <arkv01> 1 gil PogChamp
[1:57:53] <laserbeaming> Nanaki totally passes the Harkness Test
[1:57:53] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> how about 2 gil
[1:57:56] <+fingalights> Dog jin shiis
[1:58:08] <%JJCheeker> Cloud likes to get pegged
[1:58:09] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah, they throw grenades
[1:58:10] <theloganbrand> He did throw a grenade
[1:58:17] <arkv01> in this playthrough we let enemies exhaust their movelist
[1:58:20] <VoxFoxWatch> Aah yes. The FANART dictates all.
[1:58:24] <+fingalights> Isn't nanaki like 16 in his catdog age?
[1:58:28] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah, it's too much of an RPG to not have them
[1:58:40] <+AbnormalVoid> they should be subtle though, it's not an MMO or anything
[1:58:44] <rcand9> people are really mad about the grunting in this game but i welcome them Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:58:48] <arkv01> yeah nanakis in heat all the time
[1:58:53] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> thats a cool skip transistion
[1:58:56] <Knarkeberger> LUL
[1:58:56] <superspartaxyZED> ok calm down there plague
[1:59:06] <Mr_Strut> Jessie is just a step away from dry humping Cloud
[1:59:09] <VoxFoxWatch> Pianist.
[1:59:15] <+AbnormalVoid> I'm Jessie and i'm going to gargle Cloud's balls at the earliest convenience
[1:59:18] <Happy_Karl> Mad for the penis.
[1:59:18] <arkv01> jessie can you please discard your used condoms instead of keeping them in the basement hideout
[1:59:21] <+TQuick101> SADISTIC
[1:59:26] <rsg220> this is quite the video game
[1:59:34] <+fingalights> Fun Fact, all the doggo's you fight are Nanaki puppers from Hojo experiments
[1:59:36] <rcand9> beat that tentacle dog good
[1:59:45] <+AbnormalVoid> I want Wedge to make a joke about smoking Meth
[1:59:53] <+TQuick101> I do appreciate that backswings do hit enemies behind you
[1:59:55] <superspartaxyZED> honestly this doesnt look too bad for all the lack of good games we had in 2019
[1:59:56] <VoxFoxWatch> Remember kids, if you want to get past a bad word filter, just say “pianist”
[1:59:59] <%JJCheeker> Why do dogs like to park for no reason
[2:00:06] <arkv01> wuuf wuuf Wowee
[2:00:07] <%JJCheeker> BARK
[2:00:15] <%zk_nails> zk_nails subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:00:20] <+AbnormalVoid> I hate parries after 1
[2:00:27] <Cameony> I wonder if they're gonna have the shit that was dummied out in the original in this
[2:00:29] <VoxFoxWatch> @jjcheeker TOO LATE, THEY LOVE TO PARK CARS!
[2:00:30] <skleido> 5 millisecond, you mean
[2:00:53] <$Rezca> but can he truffle shuffle?
[2:00:54] <%JJCheeker> No that's not what I meant no :(
[2:01:01] <+Neoripo> Strong doggo
[2:01:04] <rcand9> parries don't have to be precise in a non pvp game
[2:01:04] <skleido> that's a great wedge impression lmao!
[2:01:09] <WarchiefGoldva> Souls would be infinitely better if From didn't "balance" things with PVP in mind. No one likes PvP and it doesn't work. Balancing for it only fucks up the entire game for everyone else.
[2:01:17] <kentrix11> I think my favorite "parry" might be blocks in KH3, the counters you do there feel great, particulary with critical counter.
[2:01:33] <VoxFoxWatch> @jjcheeker This is now in the lore! HOJO TAUGHT HIS DOGS HOW TO PARK CARS! MAKING THEM A DEADLY FORCE TO BE RECKON WITH!
[2:01:37] <%JJCheeker> Julius Caesar
[2:01:42] <+fingalights> Ending to BraveHeart, he cries like a bitch
[2:01:42] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> you will stil be forgotten in time
[2:01:52] <+AbnormalVoid> you just shit your pants
[2:01:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> So Leon from RE?
[2:02:00] <arkv01> aren't the only confirmed non-virgins in ff7 president shinra and hojo?
[2:02:03] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:02:06] <rcand9> EEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHH
[2:02:14] <%zk_nails> this is my fetish
[2:02:15] <superspartaxyZED> this is a ramble
[2:02:18] <Explodincatz> BRAP:
[2:02:19] <Jigokuro> Whatever I'm dead. Life was good.
[2:02:22] <+AbnormalVoid> I mean, if you were gonna die, then it doesn't really matter
[2:02:23] <+Neoripo> So like Geralt in book Withcher?
[2:02:24] <CrowbarFacelift> a lifetime of work, ruined
[2:02:29] <+fingalights> @arkv01 And Cornholio
[2:02:31] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> well that seems reasonable considering
[2:02:31] <laserbeaming> You farted in a frequency only women can hear
[2:02:31] <+AbnormalVoid> you already got all the best from life
[2:02:32] <+MeatBomb> same
[2:02:40] <Mr_Strut> Is this an aristocrats joke?
[2:02:42] <rsg220> You alright, Plague?
[2:02:43] <%Samex_Comex> That's one bad day
[2:02:44] <rcand9> did this happen in your first life plague?
[2:02:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> why would you care you are dead now
[2:02:57] <arkv01> @fingalights nah there's no HARD evidence corneo did anything to the girls who went into his room
[2:02:59] <Korgororo> plague you don't need to double down just stop LUL
[2:03:00] <+AbnormalVoid> just gotta understand before then that nothing mattered anyway
[2:03:01] <%JJCheeker> Could be worse
[2:03:07] <arkv01> they just played playstation!
[2:03:07] <+TQuick101> doodoo pants cry adventure
[2:03:16] <+AbnormalVoid> No :)
[2:03:19] <Mr_Strut> Sounds pretty fucking sweet
[2:03:20] <superspartaxyZED> rhetoric, one might say
[2:03:20] <laserbeaming> yeah, it be bad
[2:03:22] <+AbnormalVoid> it's be great :)
[2:03:24] <rcand9> i could get over it
[2:03:25] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> this happens to old people all th etime
[2:03:25] <+fingalights> @arkv01 You're asking for some real HARD evidence then, lol
[2:03:40] <superspartaxyZED> no, thats just my usual dream
[2:03:41] <%Samex_Comex> Marvels what if Ironman shit his pants
[2:03:50] <Mr_Strut> I think Spiderman did die like that once.
[2:04:00] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> Ironman has shit his suit on at least a few occasions cannonically
[2:04:00] <%JJCheeker> Sound a lot like my life
[2:04:09] <ThirdPersonPhil> Stop playing on my insecurities plague
[2:04:17] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> one time while very drunk
[2:04:19] <%JJCheeker> Sometimes you gotta go
[2:04:21] <arkv01> jessie the pied thot
[2:04:25] <hatsaki92> omnicrap
[2:04:26] <+fingalights> You can't tell me he didn't
[2:04:27] <$Rezca> Plague, asking the hard questions
[2:04:30] <WarchiefGoldva> Oh, but I'm sure he did. Omnishits.
[2:04:35] <rcand9> what if tifas boobs were fists?
[2:04:36] <NatsuDFTRev30> at 60/70 does it matter any more??
[2:04:39] <Mr_Strut> He's shitting his pants to assert dominance.
[2:04:40] <Explodincatz> Shitaroth
[2:04:40] <arkv01> he doesn't even have swords
[2:04:42] <%JJCheeker> he had food poisoning
[2:04:42] <superspartaxyZED> wtf
[2:04:46] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> thats what gives the move the power it has
[2:04:48] <arkv01> its just 13 poop ejections
[2:04:49] <+MeatBomb> Omni-SPLASH
[2:04:53] <%JJCheeker> This is very specific
[2:04:55] <kentrix11> IDK if a human can have that much shit on them.
[2:04:58] <%JJCheeker> ...
[2:04:59] <VoxFoxWatch> It would be the best scene ever.
[2:05:02] <Mr_Strut> Plague, have you been browsing scat threads?
[2:05:06] <+Heart0fInk> What if Cloud filled his diaper? wouldn't that be funny!? haha!
[2:05:07] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> hes shouting OYAJI
[2:05:07] <laserbeaming> You kind of lost me somewhere around Jesse shaming Cloud
[2:05:08] <VoxFoxWatch> I would die laughing.
[2:05:10] <NatsuDFTRev30> I feel cloud pooping in battle is an alternate bad ending
[2:05:12] <CrowbarFacelift> plague pls
[2:05:13] <arkv01> cloud had a hard life
[2:05:18] <ThirdPersonPhil> Is this the reason your viewers are just dropping?
[2:05:21] <+Yukasmarvin> Stop it Plague, I can't breath. that's too funny
[2:05:21] <+reiface08> i'm ready to jump ship
[2:05:23] <Korgororo> Jesus Christ LUL
[2:05:25] <arkv01> sephiroth spared him cause it was too gross
[2:05:27] <Mr_Strut> Was Tifa watching?
[2:05:33] <VoxFoxWatch> Some of it flies into sepherophs, who ends up kicking him harder.
[2:05:34] <+fingalights> Tifa saw it all
[2:05:34] <theloganbrand> Jessie and the Pumps have something in common
[2:05:37] <+jiggy_snipe> I'm assuming he still kills Sephiroth
[2:05:39] <+LordSDB> Plague please, this sounds like a newsground video NotLikeThis
[2:05:47] <$Rezca> Cheer450 I think I have had enough of questioning things
[2:05:47] <arkv01> yeah actually barret is shooting blood bullets right?
[2:05:49] <laserbeaming> Someone transcribe this and upload it to a fanfiction website
[2:05:56] <+AbnormalVoid> that's the kind of guy Barret is
[2:05:58] <Mr_Strut> The shit talk is for HIM
[2:06:12] <kuzokai> you have some strange fantasies
[2:06:17] <superspartaxyZED> well cloud is there too
[2:06:19] <+AbnormalVoid> yes I do :)
[2:06:23] <superspartaxyZED> maybe barret is gay?
[2:06:31] <superspartaxyZED> you ever think of that?
[2:06:33] <rcand9> its not even a real robot its a camera with a gun on it and barret is mad at them
[2:06:41] <+not_crabby> barret has a kid
[2:06:41] <hudson_Jak> yay ff7 remake with gripes
[2:06:42] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also why is it thunder, its the lightning that does damage, its not even that loud
[2:06:43] <+not_crabby> and wife
[2:06:56] <+AbnormalVoid> the kid's another dude's
[2:06:59] <+AbnormalVoid> and his wife is dead
[2:07:04] <+AbnormalVoid> so he could be gay still
[2:07:05] <superspartaxyZED> see
[2:07:07] <arkv01> barrets a good guy
[2:07:08] <superspartaxyZED> gay!
[2:07:09] <+MeatBomb> DOOKIE.... DOOKIE never changes.... Man, I'm lazy with th ejokes tonight.
[2:07:15] <WarchiefGoldva> Jessie likes to be in danger.
[2:07:21] <+TQuick101> Jesus Jessie
[2:07:21] <%JJCheeker> Maybe he bi
[2:07:31] <superspartaxyZED> more like
[2:07:32] <superspartaxyZED> tri
[2:07:37] <+Heart0fInk> Jessie has a fat prolapse
[2:07:47] <+AbnormalVoid> "Hey Cloud, use your Focused Strike on my butthole, lol"
[2:07:48] <+fingalights> I think if you stay on Jessie, you make it
[2:08:00] <arkv01> barret is pretty much confirmed closet gay, married just cause he came from a mining village and had to fulfill dated expectations
[2:08:06] <%Samex_Comex> Cloud is skinny enough to just slide in between the lasers
[2:08:21] <arkv01> almost got into that sweet blonde bussy at gold saucer
[2:08:30] <+AbnormalVoid> Nobody likes cute women
[2:08:45] <+AbnormalVoid> they're the pariahs of the modern age
[2:09:54] <superspartaxyZED> slightly above average!
[2:10:19] <theloganbrand> I want women with resting bitch face
[2:10:23] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> killing th eenemy is the quick way to defeat it
[2:10:32] <+AbnormalVoid> this conversation is actually really good
[2:10:42] <+AbnormalVoid> great way of glossing over Cloud not exactly knowing his age
[2:10:44] <+fingalights> Yes Berret, Live and Learn
[2:10:47] <%zk_nails> Hangin on the edge of tomorrow
[2:10:47] <arkv01> good dad jokes
[2:10:47] <superspartaxyZED> yeah that was pretty stupid
[2:10:57] <+AbnormalVoid> it's appropriate cause Barret is kinda dumb
[2:10:59] <superspartaxyZED> also he gotta know cloud is legal
[2:11:04] <+AbnormalVoid> and Cloud is kinda dumb
[2:11:04] <superspartaxyZED> see, he is gay!
[2:11:05] <+fingalights> Cloud can't say anything back either,
[2:11:06] <+ShinHadokenman> Its so stupid its perfect
[2:11:11] <superspartaxyZED> thats why he asked!
[2:11:44] <+AbnormalVoid> damn, you're right
[2:11:47] <%JJCheeker> Might be right about that
[2:11:59] <+AbnormalVoid> politicians are pretty ugly, usually
[2:12:03] <arkv01> more sexual tension
[2:12:22] <Huntercd> Hillary isn't bad
[2:12:29] <arkv01> I want the stinger to be biggs hitting on cloud even more than jessie
[2:12:36] <arkv01> and wedge getting physically aggressive
[2:12:37] <+fingalights> Jessie dies with a Bullet "Dang it, I was hoping it was you that would penetrate me"
[2:12:41] <arkv01> everyone wants a piece of the cloud ass
[2:12:43] <+AbnormalVoid> :) I want some more
[2:12:54] <+Heart0fInk> What if Jessie was a trap. PrideGasp
[2:13:02] <+AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm
[2:13:24] <Highwang> Cloud took some notes from Dante i see
[2:13:28] <superspartaxyZED> gotta get that bussy
[2:13:39] <kentrix11> The camera doesn't seem to be able to go through walls and make them transparent.
[2:13:39] <+AbnormalVoid> like Cloud
[2:13:43] <rsg220> why plague
[2:13:44] <rsg220> why
[2:13:47] <+fingalights> Hourglass Penis
[2:13:48] <PlayPerfectlyBad> This is why I love plague
[2:13:49] <+not_crabby> flower wreath of hair on the base
[2:13:51] <+AbnormalVoid> her and Cloud would match then
[2:13:52] <superspartaxyZED> very feminine indeed
[2:13:52] <+ShinHadokenman> I like when "random battles" are difficult enough too have lasting consequences aised from just game overs
[2:13:55] <+not_crabby> :)
[2:13:55] <marklarphd> Good questoin
[2:13:59] <WarchiefGoldva> Isn't that the clitoris?
[2:13:59] <kentrix11> Plague are you in a mood today?
[2:13:59] <arkv01> it IS cute
[2:14:01] <LunarRemix> Good ideas today.
[2:14:07] <Rezca> its blossoming
[2:14:10] <BurdRightsActivist> Prehensile Jackal clit 4Head
[2:14:14] <arkv01> cocky, huh barret Kreygasm
[2:14:19] <+Heart0fInk> Flower pubes
[2:14:20] <theloganbrand> Pretty Penisy, aint ya?
[2:14:26] <Huntercd> If Jessie wore panties it would be fine
[2:14:31] <Murphio_GS> "It's cute"
[2:14:40] <superspartaxyZED> right up the butt!
[2:14:44] <+AbnormalVoid> SourPls
[2:14:50] <arkv01> mr. scorpion guard, your anus is leaking..
[2:14:59] <+AbnormalVoid> Don't over-do Jessie
[2:15:05] <superspartaxyZED> do you think barret believes in the feminine penis?
[2:15:32] <PlayPerfectlyBad> So I've played this a few times now. Once you get the ATB management down you can start to juggle enemies.
[2:16:02] <+AbnormalVoid> I'm so happy there's a liberal amount of swearing
[2:16:06] <+karenxw> Barret's voice is tragically hilarious
[2:16:07] <+karenxw> I love it
[2:16:19] <+karenxw> He sounds like RDJ in Tropic Thunder
[2:16:24] <%JJCheeker> What if she Had a vagina and 2 balls
[2:16:26] <Huntercd> Yea terrorists kill the bug
[2:16:28] <+AbnormalVoid> it wouldn't be the same if Barret was all like "Gee Whillickers, Cloud, we gotta beat this big nasty."
[2:16:47] <superspartaxyZED> how embarassing
[2:16:58] <superspartaxyZED> kukuku
[2:17:01] <+AbnormalVoid> I'll say
[2:17:06] <Rezca> I can't wait for Cid's tea scene
[2:17:13] <+AbnormalVoid> GODDAMN TEA
[2:17:17] <ToeBeanHeaven> I can't wait to play as Yuffie/Cid/Vincent/Tifa.
[2:17:29] <hatsaki92> also sephiroth in that 1 battle
[2:17:32] <+fingalights> He gets ATB easy with overshot, so he can do more it feels
[2:17:33] <ToeBeanHeaven> Mostly Tifa because I loved The Bouncer.
[2:17:33] <+AbnormalVoid> Why not use any shortcuts, Plague?
[2:17:53] <superspartaxyZED> this fight is still taking like 10 minutes
[2:17:57] <+fingalights> Red and Cait sith will be weird
[2:17:59] <arkv01> definitely excited to do big combo with tifa
[2:18:11] <arkv01> and quarter circle inputs
[2:18:11] <+AbnormalVoid> they do have pre-sets
[2:18:13] <Huntercd> Yuffie and Don Corneo scenes are going to grimey
[2:18:23] <+AbnormalVoid> and holding L1 shows you the shortcuts you have set
[2:18:26] <Huntercd> I cant wait
[2:18:34] <+JailShmixRemix> Man this game looks prettty
[2:19:15] <+Heart0fInk> When does this game come out?
[2:19:23] <%JJCheeker> I see Pat is having Internet issues
[2:19:25] <+fingalights> 4/10
[2:19:38] <Highwang> man that stagger state does NOT last long
[2:19:46] <+fingalights> little over a month
[2:20:14] <Explodincatz> the stagger bar goes down in the mini cutscene
[2:20:37] <+fingalights> Yeah, i think they want you to block more
[2:20:40] <honeyman18> when you popping that limit break?
[2:20:53] <%JJCheeker> This is an interesting design for a robot
[2:21:09] <deviljhojho_> i love videogames
[2:21:13] <+themightiestmonarch> yes it has a glowing Butthole
[2:21:32] <%JJCheeker> It's like a crab scorpion
[2:21:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Berret kicks a rhomba to death "THAT ONE'S FOR DA PLANET."
[2:21:55] <+Heart0fInk> It's like a robot robot
[2:22:04] <+AbnormalVoid> I wish they'd just show you this shit
[2:22:06] <honeyman18> I want enemy Info always
[2:22:08] <+themightiestmonarch> robot robot revolution
[2:22:11] <+AbnormalVoid> it's so pointless to hide it
[2:22:29] <Explodincatz> ^
[2:22:52] <+fingalights> Yeah, i get it for weaknesses though
[2:23:06] <+AbnormalVoid> not grinding, you usually get the level 2 spells by Corel or Cosmo Canyon
[2:23:33] <honeyman18> he fall
[2:23:37] <Rezca> Insurance fraud
[2:23:49] <+fingalights> They are the insurance company though
[2:23:53] <+PhysicsLB> "fuck you, i'm out!"
[2:24:00] <+radda343> they're trying to make AVALANCHE look worse
[2:24:14] <+AbnormalVoid> I wonder what the hell the Moogle Medals will be for
[2:24:14] <+MeatBomb> Fission Mailed.
[2:24:17] <arkv01> actually better question is where does barrets funds come from?
[2:24:18] <Explodincatz> wait out the 20min to see what happens
[2:24:26] <+themightiestmonarch> I usually had one lightning and fire and maybe a restore upgraded by Costa del Sol without actually grinding but I spend some time in shinra tower getting carbon Bangles and hard edge
[2:24:37] <Explodincatz> i wonder is theres even a game over screen for it
[2:24:45] <Animorphimagi> Final Flaaaaaaash
[2:25:01] <theloganbrand> Is Cloud mondo cool? Y/N?
[2:25:12] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> so that their shareholders dont withdraw
[2:25:13] <Mr_Strut> It's all about the long con
[2:25:13] <arkv01> hey, they're generating new jobs in recontrucction!
[2:25:21] <+themightiestmonarch> he was emo before emo
[2:25:27] <+PhysicsLB> but then they can charge themselves a higher premium and make more profits
[2:25:49] <+AbnormalVoid> they have a kind of justification
[2:25:54] <+AbnormalVoid> they want to make Neo Midgar, remember?
[2:25:58] <Jigokuro> He does
[2:26:00] <Huntercd> Futaba?
[2:26:02] <+Big_Bang_BIitz> also money laundering
[2:26:05] <+fingalights> Most people do from the back
[2:26:08] <+Binary_Fireball> bloomin onion 2smul
[2:26:10] <PlayPerfectlyBad> Shinra wants to restart the war with Wutai and pin the destruction of the reactor on Avalanche and tell the public they are affiliated with Wutai.
[2:26:19] <+PhysicsLB> dude this music is soooo good
[2:26:22] <MoulesFritz> yes
[2:26:23] <+fingalights> yes
[2:26:24] <+not_crabby> 100%
[2:26:25] <superspartaxyZED> jessie is gonna become ugly
[2:26:26] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah, she'd like that
[2:26:26] <arkv01> absolutely
[2:26:28] <Explodincatz> very
[2:26:28] <+spoji> wtf...
[2:26:28] <Whiteowlsmith> absolutely
[2:26:36] <+fingalights> wait, when was that established
[2:26:43] <+themightiestmonarch> i really hope they let you play as Sephiroth when you're having the Nibelheim flashback
[2:26:43] <arkv01> 5 seconds is all he needs
[2:26:47] <rsg220> plague stop
[2:26:48] <+EyeFarted> She likes being choked???
[2:26:53] <theloganbrand> More then enough time to kill anyone that moves
[2:26:59] <+fingalights> I hope not, they don't in OG for a reason.
[2:27:06] <Animorphimagi> His only good move
[2:27:06] <+themightiestmonarch> and not just make you be Cloud and he is AI that you can't switch to
[2:27:20] <arkv01> a lot of cloud's battle soundclouds just sound off
[2:27:27] <arkv01> oh god what
[2:27:30] <arkv01> *soundbites
[2:27:36] <theloganbrand> I hope they make just enough little changes to piss people off
[2:27:54] <WarchiefGoldva> @PlagueOfGripes Maybe it's faster to save Cloud's Limit Break to use on the second sweeper.
[2:27:54] <Explodincatz> they alreasy are
[2:28:15] <Huntercd> do combo
[2:28:28] <PlayPerfectlyBad> You can't save limit breaks between battles
[2:28:36] <+themightiestmonarch> giant boss fights in areas that were originally tiny, like missing No. in the shinra mansion.
[2:28:38] <PlayPerfectlyBad> I imagine for balance purposes
[2:28:40] <+PhysicsLB> AMAZING
[2:28:49] <+MeatBomb> Are they saying "boomer altert?
[2:28:57] <+rytyoung> Hey @plagueofgripes did you get Paige and Pat into watching Beastars? if so thanks for getting them interested in it to then get me interested in it!
[2:29:01] <arkv01> balance shmalance, thats what easy mode is for
[2:29:15] <arkv01> just make bosses piss hard in normal mode
[2:29:38] <+PhysicsLB> i kinda wish 15 was more like this
[2:30:06] <+fingalights> Use it or you lose it
[2:30:06] <+spoji> nice frame drops
[2:30:08] <+themightiestmonarch> at least Castlevania season 3 comes out in a couple days. something to eat up some time till doom eternal comes out
[2:30:16] <arkv01> wow did pat give up on shilling already?

[2:30:28] <+rytyoung> @arkv01 the stream fucked up
[2:30:52] <arkv01> thats not gonna go over well with the shill daddies
[2:31:02] <+AbnormalVoid> lot of shit missing from 13
[2:31:09] <+not_crabby> you should try through classic mode
[2:31:14] <+AbnormalVoid> it's a really roughly designed game
[2:31:15] <+not_crabby> so we can sees it
[2:31:15] <+rytyoung> his sponsor is blowing in the wind
