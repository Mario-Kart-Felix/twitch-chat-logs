[0:06:00] <SaltyDavid> What does "Has" mean?
[0:06:14] <Dahvix> "Has" means someone has something else inside it
[0:06:17] <%bettysharkface> Yey

[0:06:42] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Your gohan video was really nice and I binged totally not marks videos right after it. Can you recommend more channels like this? Doesn't have to be about dragonball.
[0:06:42] <DillionPHCO> Oh no
[0:06:45] <+D4C_Trice> you mean pregnancy?
[0:06:49] <%glasphemy> a minime
[0:06:51] <+dybia> There are two rocks inside of you. Both of them are gay.
[0:06:53] <+craftyraichu> So a deranged Russian stacking doll?
[0:06:54] <%maledictus_faust> that would be pretty dandy
[0:06:55] <Dragovus> tiny cloned babies aren't those children
[0:06:57] <%DaKnightWarrior> sounds cool
[0:06:58] <TheKeaDane> Sounds like something Karl Pilkington would theorize
[0:06:59] <+EyeFarted> Soak your rock in rocks
[0:07:02] <+Nexoosen> if it inherits memories that'd be OP
[0:07:04] <%bettysharkface> Maximum asexual life
[0:07:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> Tbh I feel so much Joy watching plague streams
[0:07:10] <SaltyDavid> I hate that the only example of that I can think of is Rick and Morty

[0:07:15] <%glasphemy> Maximise virginity

[0:08:15] <alrobot2014> oh god now i see it, but it looks more like a nipple
[0:08:18] <JakeIsNotGross> What is love without a penis?
[0:08:18] <$studleydoorite> how else would it animate besides having a penis
[0:08:22] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes I think you need to jerk off quick
[0:08:23] <+EyeFarted> looks like an inverted ass to me
[0:08:23] <cap_bon> Love Is Penis

[0:08:52] <+Nexoosen> the boxee will help
[0:09:00] <silentorbweaver> everything that "melt" is melted by "hot"
[0:09:17] <+dybia> Box is you, because box is not melt
[0:09:19] <Prism_Wing> Everyone thinks you're the plague expert, perhaps Kappa
[0:09:21] <%KevinsLunchbox> love doesnt melt stuff, it melts on contact to hot stuff
[0:09:29] <$studleydoorite> classic Plauge, trying to boil Love down to 1s and 0s
[0:09:40] <dumdumdeeditty> love in the air ?
[0:09:42] <+psydaku> LUL
[0:09:45] <+jiffyrustle> is this a dark souls mod?
[0:09:54] <%maledictus_faust> everyone knows that you need soap to make love and water mix
[0:10:00] <+Cucamabungabu> But who is Baba?
[0:10:11] <fallenverto81> Just bought this the other night while on sale. Breeze through the tutorial levels.
[0:10:29] <fallenverto81> It is fun. It is like pretending to be a coder.
[0:10:31] <Dragovus> box is melt?
[0:10:42] <ConfusedCultist> Love is box? So box is melt
[0:10:44] <TheAsylumCat> every one asks who is baba, but no one asks how is baba.
[0:10:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> he cant access the melt statement while hes inside the water @Dragovus
[0:10:56] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Do you also sometimes look in the mirror and think: "Man, what a sack of shit"
[0:11:00] <Solokaldaka> woopsHey chat
[0:11:03] <+dybia> Box is not melt, so box can go outside
[0:11:13] <SaltyDavid> You somehow have to melt box

[0:21:05] <whittacre> @CrimsonDio11 I think that one's implicit

[0:24:27] <redrix_3> hey plague have you ever heard of a game called snakebird?
[0:24:27] <%bettysharkface> Consumer has Cell, gotta melt Consumer to get the good Cell
[0:24:28] <ckkc1> Do the chowder thing
[0:24:41] <ckkc1> where you keep the design static
[0:24:44] <SaltyDavid> They could just do that Chowder thing yeah
[0:24:45] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Extra details like that suck to draw when making cells
[0:25:02] <%KevinsLunchbox> Box Gib Flag
[0:25:10] <DrFaustMD> what about like in the show Chowder where patterns move on the character
[0:25:36] <%KevinsLunchbox> yeah the sound design is fun
[0:25:37] <+zafooru> It reminds me of old PS1 games like metal gear
[0:25:44] <%bettysharkface> The little puff puffs are satisfying for the movement
[0:25:47] <%SilverRoddo> I feel a plaid Cell would have been best.
[0:25:51] <chronoxgp> Hey Plague, I was wondering for Pikachu Libre if there was an alternate BDSM costume and was it a sex thing?
[0:25:58] <ÊÆ∫ÂÆ≥ËÄÖ> Plague is a ohnBox
[0:26:09] <+arancet> just move box is you string down one
[0:26:14] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Love is Love

[0:26:46] <%KevinsLunchbox> it doesnt matter if love melts tbh @SpaghettiPuncher because Box Has Flag
[0:27:03] <SaltyDavid> Plague might sound composed right now but deep down his inner monologue is "BUT BABA"
[0:27:21] <Garden_Hills> Baba Butt
[0:27:32] <%SilverRoddo> Love is a battlefield, if we‚Äôre honest.
[0:27:34] <Garden_Hills> Butt IS Touch
[0:27:38] <+SpaghettiPuncher> @KevinsLunchbox I was thinking he could be both again and melt the box while moving both objects
[0:27:47] <+arancet> need water hot and box push
[0:27:48] <+zafooru> You can do it, Mr. Of Gripes

[0:29:39] <%JJCheeker> I believe in you
[0:29:58] <Varadox> Twitch plays ads regardless on mobile.
[0:30:00] <%glasphemy> kinki is me?
[0:30:03] <%SilverRoddo> Just allocate all of you time into animationz?
[0:30:07] <%bettysharkface> Would you consider streaming your animation sessions, or are you concerned about spoiling it?
[0:30:17] <+zafooru> deep
[0:30:18] <%KevinsLunchbox> even if you have ads disabled I think twitch will auto play ads when people come to a stream during primetime hours

[0:30:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> Keke is nice tbh
[0:30:54] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:31:24] <%KevinsLunchbox> oh, Beastars is on netflix now so i watched the whole thing. very good
[0:32:15] <%bettysharkface> I spat my water
[0:32:18] <%bettysharkface> Gdi
[0:32:25] <%JJCheeker> That gave me the giggles
[0:33:02] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Baba is you is a pretty good english gramamr teaching tool

[0:33:46] <+Cucamabungabu> @Fenlig how can one man be so wrong. Keke is poopoo
[0:33:47] <%SilverRoddo> Beastars was a good. I could go for some MMD with Legoshi‚Äôs character model.
[0:33:47] <+dybia> keke does not have love
[0:33:47] <+TIME_PUNCHER> if text floats does it float over walls?
[0:33:48] <+zafooru> <3
[0:34:05] <alrobot2014> can love sink?
[0:34:12] <ThirdPersonPhil> Box is YOU
[0:34:15] <+zafooru> text is magic
[0:34:20] <ÊÆ∫ÂÆ≥ËÄÖ> Floats across water?
[0:34:22] <MonstarGrrrl> but bababaaaa
[0:34:27] <Ericgi231> Text can sink if it is not float
[0:34:29] <Emjit> Text is float prevents you from sinking water with it
[0:34:30] <+TIME_PUNCHER> text floats 1mm high
[0:34:31] <+zafooru> Text passes over water, wall, but not box
[0:34:35] <+Nexoosen> text sink if not float
[0:34:35] <%bettysharkface> Because you can't use it to delete water
[0:34:37] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Why is you not big dicks and fast animate?
[0:34:41] <+dybia> Keke sinks, but keke does not have love
[0:34:49] <jifbua> text dont sink if float
[0:34:50] <chronoxgp> love is push love is box
[0:34:53] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Maybe cause water is sink?
[0:34:55] <TheAsylumCat> are we gonna turn the river into love, being a river of love?
[0:35:02] <$Valdorick> Now kill Kiki?
[0:35:03] <Phob05> does text float over wall?
[0:35:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> box is kiki? and you?
[0:35:12] <+shadowace2400> kiki is push?
[0:35:31] <+zafooru> Team magma represent!
[0:35:34] <Alseid> WATER MUST BE DESTROYED
[0:35:42] <chronoxgp> you still have to go inside the walls
[0:35:47] <+Nexoosen> the first objective is to get into the room
[0:35:48] <chronoxgp> might as well make that step 1
[0:35:49] <+dybia> keke is push
[0:35:51] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Ford the river!
[0:35:56] <+shadowace2400> box is kiki?
[0:36:07] <TheImmortal70> Oh I have an insane idea
[0:36:10] <+shadowace2400> OH GOD BOX IS KIKI
[0:36:15] <+shadowace2400> I just realized
[0:36:20] <+Nexoosen> what are the rules on suggestions?
[0:36:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> you can turn BOX into another KEKE right? dunno if that helps
[0:36:37] <%glasphemy> plague will either ignore you or be mad at you
[0:36:41] <%bettysharkface> He's not really asking for suggestions, just talking out loud
[0:36:47] <%glasphemy> roll the dice at your own risk
[0:36:48] <+shadowace2400> it will destroy the water?
[0:36:56] <%bettysharkface> Don't answer him unless he explicitly asks
[0:37:09] <+shadowace2400> kiki has love?
[0:37:16] <zmuno> what float does?
[0:37:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> KEKE is LOVE AFTER THAT
[0:37:29] <+Nexoosen> why do you need love?
[0:37:34] <+shadowace2400> box has kiki?
[0:37:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> Make another keke get in then make love out of keke
[0:37:43] <+dybia> Spawn love, then love is push
[0:37:43] <$Valdorick> 5
[0:37:43] <%SilverRoddo> First comes love üé∂
[0:37:45] <+TIME_PUNCHER> @zmuno it lets text float over water and love
[0:37:46] <+shadowace2400> kiki has box
[0:37:50] <%bettysharkface> If he says "chat what do I need to do" tell him, but otherwise he's just thinking out loud
[0:37:53] <+MMetas> Heyo plague, have a good time streamin
[0:38:07] <chronoxgp> just push the box on the puddle for us
[0:38:08] <Alseid> "Love is immutable"
[0:38:09] <zmuno> @TIME_PUNCHER thanks o/
[0:38:15] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Why is love needed if love is defeat?
[0:38:16] <+TIME_PUNCHER> np
[0:38:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you can enter there the solution is probably in there
[0:38:23] <TheAsylumCat> what if you become love?
[0:38:23] <+Nexoosen> i dont know
[0:38:24] <+shadowace2400> love isn't needed
[0:38:30] <+Nexoosen> can you repeat the question
[0:38:33] <Panboy> can you push something accross so something is wall
[0:38:36] <%bettysharkface> "Yes no, maybe, I don't knoooow, can you repeat the question~"
[0:38:43] <%SilverRoddo> *tongue cluck*
[0:38:57] <+shadowace2400> kiki has box has kiki has box has kiki
[0:39:05] <TheImmortal70> This one is fun
[0:39:14] <TheImmortal70> You ARE box
[0:39:20] <ThirdPersonPhil> BOX has you?
[0:39:45] <+MMetas> make keke push instead
[0:39:47] <+shadowace2400> box is kiki
[0:39:49] <$Valdorick> Nah, box has you kills you
[0:39:55] <+shadowace2400> then destroy water
[0:40:05] <+dybia> Love has love, then love is push
[0:40:07] <chronoxgp> i jus noticed the walls and tree trunks are moving
[0:40:07] <%bettysharkface> Big water murder
[0:40:08] <+shadowace2400> then make kiki has box
[0:40:11] <ThirdPersonPhil> making 2 kekes give you access to LOVE, HAS and BOX that could be usefull
[0:40:15] <%SilverRoddo> plagueGripes_LH is RPGPhatLoot
[0:40:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> ... that could work
[0:40:36] <%bettysharkface> Shrug emoji
[0:40:39] <$Valdorick> Does "love is push" make love not kill you?
[0:40:44] <@dcn2049> kiki is not float
[0:40:57] <+Wafflum> Even if you could do it, "___ HAS YOU" doesn't actually do anything iirc
[0:40:58] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Does push override defeat?
[0:41:00] <%bettysharkface> Dacon is green today
[0:41:02] <Fenlig> peebroDerp
[0:41:06] <BlabeXTheMHunter> does text push the boes?
[0:41:11] <@dcn2049> I change colors randomly
[0:41:12] <JonnyJug> Love Is War
[0:41:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> what happens if you manage to make has combine with what ever you are?
[0:41:15] <BlabeXTheMHunter> boxes*
[0:41:33] <Dutchpotato> Love will set u free dutchpCheer
[0:41:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> does that make you invencible cause you spawn after you kill yourself?
[0:41:38] <%bettysharkface> What, no loyalty to red?
[0:41:48] <@dcn2049> I have loyalty to nothing
[0:41:54] <+shadowace2400> OH OH
[0:41:55] <%bettysharkface> Aw
[0:42:01] <%bettysharkface> How lonely
[0:42:02] <+shadowace2400> love has box
[0:42:04] <+MMetas> Plague try turn you into box and keke into push, push keke into the water then make it so box has keke
[0:42:04] <+shadowace2400> box has love
[0:42:08] <+MMetas> then run into the water
[0:42:11] <+shadowace2400> love is push
[0:42:13] <@dcn2049> It's a living
[0:42:17] <Panboy> its recursive!
[0:42:17] <+shadowace2400> box is push
[0:42:18] <KitsuneManami> Ew what are these graphics, why arent they realistic AAA? only AAA are good games
[0:42:20] <zmuno> push box is push
[0:42:25] <+shadowace2400> yeah yeah
[0:42:26] <KitsuneManami> psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:42:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> Can you make what ever you are HAS what ever you are so when you die you respawn int eh same spot?
[0:42:39] <Zekuu69> psaElmo
[0:42:46] <gunsrlove> Baba is just programming without tpying things and using arguments and functions with brackets and shit
[0:42:57] <$Valdorick> What if... you make yourself box, push Keke into water, take the worse love and has with keke is push, and... no... not enough works to make Box is Flag is win... and then you'd not be box, so lose anyway... damn
[0:43:02] <chronoxgp> box has box
[0:43:04] <chronoxgp> come on now
[0:43:07] <$Valdorick> words*
[0:43:09] <%bettysharkface> I think the m&m group would have words about that @dcn2049
[0:43:09] <+TIME_PUNCHER> I think I see it. I need to buy this game
[0:43:16] <%glasphemy> delicious snackrifice
[0:43:21] <+MMetas> YOu can alternate keke and box using "Has"
[0:43:34] <+MMetas> so every time you run into water a new ting spawns
[0:43:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> F
[0:43:41] <@dcn2049> M&Ms hurt my throat, so I care not for what those little knife covered chocolates have to say
[0:43:48] <+Qsmash_> h-he's doing it monkaS
[0:44:12] <ThirdPersonPhil> Make 2 KEKES enter the room bring BOX and HAS out, turn into Box agains and then "Box Has Box is You"
[0:44:15] <%bettysharkface> Morons and Mercs ya silly @dcn2049
[0:44:21] <chronoxgp> box has love, box has kiki
[0:44:23] <+MMetas> make is so keke has love
[0:44:27] <ThirdPersonPhil> Box has Box is you
[0:44:27] <+MMetas> make love have push
[0:44:35] <@dcn2049> Hahaha, well yeah. That's a bit different
[0:44:42] <%bettysharkface> There ya go
[0:44:46] <ThirdPersonPhil> BOX HAS BOX IS YOU
[0:44:48] <LittleBigQuebec> Box Has Keke -> keke is box -> box is you?
[0:44:52] <LittleBigQuebec> maybe?
[0:45:11] <+MMetas> Make Love pushable
[0:45:25] <TheImmortal70> Infinity
[0:45:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> BOX HAS BOX MAKES BOX IMORTAL, right?
[0:45:34] <$Valdorick> Box Has Box?
[0:45:35] <chronoxgp> box has box
[0:45:40] <chronoxgp> push them into water
[0:45:45] <%KevinsLunchbox> youre good plague
[0:45:53] <EDFscout> oof
[0:45:56] <%bettysharkface> He ain't asking you guys, come on
[0:45:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> fug
[0:45:58] <gsoto83> have you asked Peach?
[0:46:04] <%bettysharkface> Just let him do it
[0:46:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> paige hasnt gotten this far
[0:46:07] <gsoto83> Also hi!
[0:46:07] <EDFscout> BUT BABA
[0:46:10] <zmuno> @ThirdPersonPhil Uhhhhhmmmmm
[0:46:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> you had the set up for box has box is you
[0:46:17] <@dcn2049> Yeah he likes to do this himself
[0:46:18] <RumonGray> but BABA...
[0:46:25] <$Valdorick> Peaches Spirit has been summoned, and apeased.
[0:46:26] <%KevinsLunchbox> @ThirdPersonPhil dude come on
[0:46:26] <gsoto83> BBBAAAAAABA
[0:46:28] <Panboy> if only keke could jump
[0:46:29] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you box and box has box when box die box comes out
[0:46:48] <+Lizard0TM> Brute smarts it
[0:46:50] <Dutchpotato> But if keke is you then what is baba????
[0:46:57] <gsoto83> make love with box...
[0:46:57] <Ericgi231> baba is dead
[0:46:58] <%bettysharkface> Let him figure it out himself
[0:47:04] <TheImmortal70> Where is baba?
[0:47:05] <$Valdorick> baba ceases to be
[0:47:06] <%bettysharkface> Don't be just posting it
[0:47:10] <TheImmortal70> Baba isnt you
[0:47:15] <Dutchpotato> Baba ceases to be
[0:47:15] <rendroken> no
[0:47:22] <EDFscout> I'm just curious what he thinks "HAS" does
[0:47:24] <ThirdPersonPhil> i tough he was reading it, he was taking advice earlier wasnt him?
[0:47:34] <%bettysharkface> No
[0:47:40] <%bettysharkface> He just thinks out loud
[0:47:49] <%KevinsLunchbox> @ThirdPersonPhil blurting out the answer ist advice you troglodyte
[0:47:51] <%bettysharkface> If it lines up with what you say, is just coincidence
[0:47:53] <@dcn2049> Love can't save you
[0:48:04] <+MMetas> OH plague iuse the text and two boxes to push has out
[0:48:13] <$jobbedbone> where we're going we don't need love
[0:48:14] <+MMetas> Er two kiki I mean
[0:48:15] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Love, like in real life, is a red herring
[0:48:19] <Dutchpotato> Love LUL what a worthless emotion, I‚Äôm glad baba proves that :)
[0:48:22] <$Valdorick> In the words of old time "banging you tonight" songs - what has love got to do with it?
[0:48:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> i was just thinking out loud too... solutions in this game does sound like nonsense
[0:48:32] <chronoxgp> he keeps doin the later steps first
[0:48:38] <chronoxgp> just work on getting in the room first
[0:48:43] <chronoxgp> instead of crossing the river
[0:49:01] <EDFscout> Can't sacrifice text to pass the river
[0:49:02] <JonnyJug> If the text didn't float, you could push it into the water to remove it
[0:49:06] <%bettysharkface> He will only sometimes read chat, and even then, do you honestly think he'll be glad you spoiled the solution?
[0:49:07] <+SpaghettiPuncher> It's so you can't destroy the text in water
[0:49:09] <%KevinsLunchbox> text is float to prevent words from brute forcing water
[0:49:15] <JakeIsNotGross> Otherwise you could use text to break river
[0:49:28] <+dybia> Push enough text to get an is to flag
[0:49:30] <%maledictus_faust> its fun watching chat lose their mind while watching plague. this is true entertainment
[0:49:30] <chambatron> I Think it means the text won't sink if placed over water
[0:49:41] <ThirdPersonPhil> i was also repeating cause i was still working out it in my head to see if it worked, i dont even know if x has x makes it imortal or just results in some other weird stuff
[0:49:41] <TheAsylumCat> I think you make a bridge of words to change the property of water
[0:49:44] <EDFscout> F for Keeks
[0:49:52] <RiverBirch> !!!
[0:50:05] <$jobbedbone> ohhhh
[0:50:07] <chronoxgp> jesus christ plague
[0:50:13] <RiverBirch> I have, a crazy idea.
[0:50:17] <$Valdorick> oooo
[0:50:17] <$jobbedbone> same
[0:50:20] <chronoxgp> you're killing me
[0:50:26] <@dcn2049> hahahaha
[0:50:28] <+dybia> Love is also defeat
[0:50:33] <%maledictus_faust> this is the best
[0:50:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> has is a schrodingers statement tbh. the love inside doesnt exist unless you acknowledge it
[0:50:44] <chronoxgp> 4
[0:50:45] <+SpaghettiPuncher> Breaking has give object
[0:50:45] <$jobbedbone> THIS IS PAIN
[0:50:48] <chronoxgp> you have 4
[0:50:48] <Alseid> Figured it out
[0:51:03] <%bettysharkface> If you aren't able to watch him play the game, without screaming your ideas or solutions at him, probably you need to just calm down and keep your thoughts inside
[0:51:09] <gsoto83> Push your self to be the best Plauge
[0:51:09] <+TQuick101> Man you all take this way too seriously
[0:51:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:51:12] <rendroken> no one cares
[0:51:35] <%KevinsLunchbox> this is great
[0:51:36] <+shadowace2400> box has kiki is box
[0:51:37] <+TQuick101> love is love is love is love
[0:51:38] <chronoxgp> we've been watching since 11:37 who cares
[0:51:39] <Zedimonx5> Plague is win PogChamp
[0:51:42] <+SpaghettiPuncher> But if object give love, but then love destroy, is love good?
[0:51:43] <RiverBirch> I have an idea.
[0:51:54] <%maledictus_faust> it's so great how his mind just tap dances around the solution
[0:51:59] <chronoxgp> box x box
[0:51:59] <+Lizard0TM> keke is love?
[0:51:59] <+shadowace2400> Plague, Box has Kiki is Boxc
[0:52:00] <+Nexoosen> you're close, you can do it
[0:52:06] <$Valdorick> Try EVERYTHING.
[0:52:06] <EDFscout> !
[0:52:08] <RiverBirch> What if
[0:52:10] <RiverBirch> Box has box?
[0:52:13] <Alseid> love is...
[0:52:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> not screaming jsut failing at doing cammel case some times
[0:52:16] <$jobbedbone> lol
[0:52:18] <+ChipZafari> lmao
[0:52:20] <$jobbedbone> YES
[0:52:20] <%KevinsLunchbox> we DID IT
[0:52:21] <TheImmortal70> Infinite
[0:52:22] <warmnoid> LUL
[0:52:22] <$Valdorick> u did
[0:52:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> KEKW
[0:52:24] <@dcn2049> heh
[0:52:24] <RiverBirch> BOX HAS BOX IS GREAT.
[0:52:25] <+MMetas> nice job!
[0:52:25] <+Lizard0TM> wow
[0:52:26] <%bettysharkface> Ya did it
[0:52:27] <warmnoid> recursion baybee
[0:52:27] <%maledictus_faust> PokCroagunk
[0:52:28] <chronoxgp> yeah bro nice try
[0:52:30] <RumonGray> that was great x3
[0:52:31] <+swaggopotamus> I WAS RIGHT
[0:52:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> why not?
[0:52:33] <+Gamenoob11> box has box
[0:52:36] <Rumbutt> You've invented infinite box
[0:52:38] <Alseid> ok, not what I was thinking of but yeah
[0:52:40] <$Valdorick> "That should not have worked" is this game's logic puzzles in a nutshell.
[0:52:40] <Dutchpotato> It makes perfect sense
[0:52:40] <+MMetas> nah it was fine plague you have another you in you
[0:52:41] <+SpaghettiPuncher> It's a bottomless box
[0:52:41] <Rumbutt> cats love it
[0:52:46] <%maledictus_faust> infinibox
[0:52:48] <+ChipZafari> technically I think turns "continue" even after you die
[0:52:51] <$jobbedbone> the other box was always in there, these rules don't care about time
[0:52:51] <Emjit> Death doesnt end the game
[0:52:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> the box died and instantly another box appeared
[0:52:52] <+Audega> Well, now you know, I guess
[0:52:54] <+Gamenoob11> Cat has butter on back drop cat infinite energy
[0:52:56] <+arancet> you dont "die" you just lose your objeect
[0:52:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> exactly
[0:53:04] <JonnyJug> This game is all about figuring out which this occurs first
[0:53:07] <@dcn2049> this game has a lot of puzzles built on you not knowing how shit works until you stumble across it
[0:53:07] <Dutchpotato> It‚Äôs just a slightly smaller box inside
[0:53:11] <ThespianBarrage> Why not?
[0:53:11] <TheAsylumCat> oh God it's a schrodinger's statement
[0:53:12] <TheImmortal70> It makes too much sense, as there is no failure state
[0:53:14] <JakeIsNotGross> It runs all options until next possible input.
[0:53:16] <%bettysharkface> I think this section is teaching you "your guts contain infinite secret babies"
[0:53:18] <+SpaghettiPuncher> @PlagueOfGripes Well the game keeps going if you remove the word YOU
[0:53:19] <warmnoid> there's a slightly different solution to that one i think
[0:53:25] <Ericgi231> Box touches water and both die at the same time, box then spawns another box
[0:53:25] <@dcn2049> ew babies
[0:53:26] <ThespianBarrage> It is very literal. =P
[0:53:28] <+SpaghettiPuncher> You just can't move
[0:53:29] <$studleydoorite> Baba preys on your assumptions
[0:53:34] <$jobbedbone> HAS is powerful
[0:53:36] <TheImmortal70> Theres only states where theres nothing you can move
[0:53:39] <+Nexoosen> most puzzles have multiple solutions
[0:53:43] <@dcn2049> Like a teleporter!
[0:53:44] <rendroken> it's like musou tensei
[0:53:46] <%KevinsLunchbox> Plague. how many times are you willing to kill yourself to reach a obtainable goal in Baba? because the answer is not zero
[0:53:53] <$Valdorick> Recrusive Immortallity! Become as Jellyfish!
[0:53:58] <JonnyJug> It's basically Cell
[0:53:59] <%glasphemy> just minime again
[0:54:01] <+Gamenoob11> kiki is god
[0:54:04] <+Qsmash_> your body was containing a second body
[0:54:05] <%Panda_Knight> Panda_Knight subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:54:06] <chambatron> Sounds like a Monday to me
[0:54:10] <ThespianBarrage> The problem is assumptions. The game makes none, it does exactly what it says.
[0:54:17] <$Valdorick> Its like fi you die and you become a skeleton
[0:54:21] <Dutchpotato> Makes sense
[0:54:35] <TheImmortal70> And then the car pops out a box
[0:54:38] <coldarmracer> that logic would have helped in the area 51 invasion
[0:54:44] <Skeletonmanners> hey plague hope you have great time and people don't backseat too much
[0:54:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> the world of Baba doesnt follow our universe pshyics
[0:54:57] <TheImmortal70> Created nor destroyed
[0:55:04] <TheImmortal70> Just converted
[0:55:06] <%maledictus_faust> yes you can
[0:55:07] <@dcn2049> It can't be created from nothing
[0:55:08] <+swaggopotamus> Cant be created nor destroyed just transformed
[0:55:09] <%bettysharkface> If ya'll be spoiling this one I don't care I'm tired I'm gonna fall asleep listening to Plague get confused about science and Baba. Night night.
[0:55:10] <ThirdPersonPhil> Smash has Nuke?
[0:55:15] <Panboy> yes and you can, thats what a proton accelerator does
[0:55:18] <+Audega> Plague's about to solve the mysteries of the universe
[0:55:19] <@dcn2049> Cya Betty
[0:55:20] <$Valdorick> In theory you could, yeah. Consider Lighting is plasma, and plasma is a state of matter.
[0:55:23] <+Gamenoob11> so, contain a nuke's energy and make kiki
[0:55:30] <+swaggopotamus> 'ITs a transformation.
[0:55:31] <Rumbutt> but energy eventually becomes matter
[0:55:32] <%maledictus_faust> matter is energy
[0:55:33] <Skeletonmanners> there's leftovers
[0:55:34] <%glasphemy> matter and energy are interchangeable, can't be a profit
[0:55:36] <%KevinsLunchbox> thats transformation, not destruction
[0:55:38] <gsoto83> In theory you can, the hard part I believe is making the energy take permanent form
[0:55:40] <%kyh9> Energy disperses, so you'd have to exert energy to concentrate energy back into matter
[0:55:40] <StencilOST> its not destroyed its transformed. it can be converted back
[0:55:42] <coldarmracer> the particles that make up the matter still exist
[0:55:50] <TheImmortal70> A proton accelerator doesnt create protons does it?
[0:55:50] <Palmtuna> You tell 'em, Plague
[0:55:51] <TheAsylumCat> slow down plague my nose is bleeding
[0:55:51] <Garden_Hills> I think its semantics
[0:55:57] <%glasphemy> as a fizzy cyst I am grabbing you by the shoulders
[0:55:58] <Fenlig> Do trees convert energy to matter?
[0:56:00] <%glasphemy> why are you like this
[0:56:00] <%kyh9> matter = energy, they're not different
[0:56:07] <+swaggopotamus> At least the good ones.
[0:56:08] <FennecZephyr> @Fenlig Yes, actually
[0:56:10] <%KevinsLunchbox> 16 year old Stephan Hawking would kick your ass for this
[0:56:13] <arkv01> his quantum edged knife
[0:56:19] <$Valdorick> They'd pull out their energy knife, that creates a blade with energy, and stab you.
[0:56:22] <gsoto83> BUT BaBA
[0:56:23] <+Gamenoob11> draw man outwits physicists, more on this at 5
[0:56:23] <arkv01> cut your electrons apart
[0:56:28] <Garden_Hills> now theres an idea, Semantics the game
[0:56:35] <%kyh9> HE KNOWS TOO MUCH
[0:56:39] <TheImmortal70> The metaphysical knife
[0:56:53] <+dybia> key is box
[0:56:54] <an_old_story> It‚Äôs the bonds between electrons and neutrons and protons being destroyed that creates energy not the destruction of matter
[0:57:01] <RumonGray> I bet they all call their knives "occam's razor"
[0:57:02] <$studleydoorite> the theoretical knife physicist already knows the answer
[0:57:03] <%maledictus_faust> schrodinger's knife
[0:57:05] <$Valdorick> The omniknife, that exists in all states of matter, and energy.
[0:57:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> ooh man, i remember this puzzle
[0:57:35] <Zedimonx5> Bitch is weak, physicist is bitch
[0:57:36] <Panboy> there is an and !
[0:57:40] <Xarvoss> He needs to think with portals
[0:57:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> AND is so strong
[0:57:56] <cham52> baba is you and box?
[0:57:58] <Fenlig> Brain is smooth
[0:58:02] <gsoto83> Baba is WEAK BITCH
[0:58:03] <+MMetas> Baba is a weak punk bitchz!
[0:58:14] <Garden_Hills> Smooth brain is scrotum
[0:58:19] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[0:58:19] <warmnoid> heh
[0:58:22] <gsoto83> GET WEAK BITCH
[0:58:23] <@dcn2049> lol
[0:58:24] <EuropanLamprey> Baba is Suicidal
[0:58:27] <%KevinsLunchbox> WEAK
[0:58:28] <+Gamenoob11> ankle breaker
[0:58:29] <YakumoYomi> Our eyes have opened
[0:58:30] <TheImmortal70> WEAK
[0:58:40] <xrolenks> my boi baba
[0:58:42] <Ericgi231> The grass has a KNIFE
[0:58:55] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> Baba is box and you?
[0:58:59] <chronoxgp> box is baba
[0:59:00] <EuropanLamprey> Baba is Quarantined
[0:59:02] <Antarctician> you are box, you are key
[0:59:17] <cham52> What about Baba is you and key?
[0:59:27] <+Audega> Baba Has Key?
[0:59:34] <%KevinsLunchbox> remember your training Plague
[0:59:36] <$Valdorick> Lets see... Baba has key, and key is you?
[1:00:07] <Panboy> oh i think i gets it, the last level trained us for this
[1:00:41] <+Gamenoob11> you has key?
[1:00:55] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you die on a tile and you has you where do you spawn?
[1:01:24] <gsoto83> Baba must consume BABA
[1:01:26] <+dybia> I think weak only goes one way so it can go down
[1:01:38] <%maledictus_faust> the ourobaba
[1:02:10] <+lion_oh> Key and Baba is You?
[1:02:11] <StencilOST> baba has keay adn box?
[1:02:15] <ralphwiggum16> hi plague
[1:02:15] <TheImmortal70> Paige never did go back to baba did she
[1:02:23] <+MMetas> baba can only ever be baba
[1:02:28] <Dutchpotato> Nope, it‚Äôs a shame
[1:02:29] <ralphwiggum16> man have I ever told you guis how much I hate bunnies?
[1:02:44] <%KevinsLunchbox> BABA IS BABA
[1:02:47] <TheImmortal70> You need the brain goo
[1:02:52] <JakeIsNotGross> You're wasting your AND at present.
[1:03:00] <Dutchpotato> Tbf these later levels might have killed Paige so it‚Äôs for the best
[1:03:09] <$Valdorick> Baba seems killable and required to die in this puzzle? Or... hmmm...
[1:03:16] <EuropanLamprey> Time to play the game of "Can I beat this map before Plague?"
[1:03:22] <spardanwarrior> Is "X AND HAS X" a valid statement?
[1:03:30] <%KevinsLunchbox> no
[1:03:46] <TheImmortal70> If it were Has would override and
[1:03:50] <$Valdorick> Oh... yes. Okay.
[1:04:08] <+MMetas> Baba is you and has box
[1:04:08] <Emjit> X is you and has x would be valid @spardanwarrior
[1:04:08] <Dutchpotato> Does Has work with You?
[1:04:09] <+Lizard0TM> box is baba on top doesn't work?
[1:04:12] <TheImmortal70> Because thatd change what kind of word And is
[1:04:37] <chronoxgp> it's not poetry dude
[1:04:43] <ralphwiggum16> how does anything benefit you?
[1:04:46] <+MMetas> then make box is you from the top
[1:04:54] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Hi @plagueofgripes how is the plague of paranoia and quaratines treating you
[1:04:56] <+dybia> You can make baba weak going down I think
[1:05:09] <FennecZephyr> Maybe Baba Has Box + box has key?
[1:05:31] <+MMetas> "Baba you and has box"? then from you top "box is you"?
[1:05:33] <+KityLinn> wow chat, get with it
[1:05:39] <+TQuick101> get exposed, chat
[1:05:48] <+LunarLancaster> Can you interact with the trees? Like can you put "is Box" next to a tree?
[1:05:55] <%KevinsLunchbox> no
[1:06:00] <xivilian> baba is you and weak baba has box. box is you mgiht work.
[1:06:02] <Dutchpotato> No text only
[1:06:03] <%KevinsLunchbox> there is no Tree word
[1:06:15] <+datKado> do you need the word "and"?
[1:06:22] <%KevinsLunchbox> yeah of course
[1:06:24] <$Valdorick> Key and Baba is you - Baba has box, kill baba, box has key?
[1:06:43] <dandy_alpha> Box is weak, box has key
[1:06:57] <+KityLinn> but baba needs to be weak
[1:07:02] <+KityLinn> in order to be broken
[1:07:06] <+Aeoneth> baba is you and box, box has key
[1:07:10] <Fenlig> But baba is box and box is you
[1:07:11] <FrankysDream> baba has box, box is key?
[1:07:21] <+LunarLancaster> But Baba
[1:07:21] <$Valdorick> No wait, my version kills baba before key spawns, so you lose.
[1:07:33] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[1:07:43] <arcadethehedgehog> All I want to say Plague is that I totally agree with you on Krillin is a little Shit in your 3 girl fusion stream.
[1:07:47] <Fenlig> Leave baba to die and accent to box state
[1:07:50] <FrankysDream> or baba has box and key is box and weak
[1:07:54] <an_old_story> ‚ÄúSave the weak for later‚Äù plague 2020
[1:08:07] <%KevinsLunchbox> BOX IS WEAK
[1:08:12] <$Valdorick> Brute smarting
[1:08:28] <+MMetas> Oh I got it, start with "Baba is you and weak" then "baba has box" from the left and then "Box is you" from the middle
[1:08:28] <+LunarLancaster> Baba too strong
[1:08:32] <weatherreport240> Have "Weak Baba is box and has key" " been considered
[1:08:40] <$Valdorick> Box and Baba is you, Baba is weak, box has... nope.
[1:08:44] <Fenlig> Your need to swap your idea of baba and boc
[1:08:50] <TheAsylumCat> not good with cooperative puzzle solving so I'm just gonna fart around
[1:09:29] <Fenlig> Baba is box and box is you
[1:09:32] <$Valdorick> Nope
[1:09:39] <Emjit> Yes you can
[1:09:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> i love this game. its a damn shame the people who made it didnt get the recognition it deserves
[1:09:48] <coldarmracer> omg how do you play this game. listening to you suffer is hurting me
[1:09:49] <$Valdorick> You can, bu... OH! THAT WAY
[1:09:57] <TheAsylumCat> @fenlig no because baba is baba
[1:10:01] <Emjit> Not that it's useful
[1:10:03] <+KityLinn> lol
[1:10:04] <+firmlygraspi1> Pog
[1:10:07] <ahaegotrigger> amazing
[1:10:11] <Fenlig> Ahhh
[1:10:12] <xivilian> @Emjit shhht :D
[1:10:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[1:10:23] <+MMetas> Box is you
[1:10:24] <+MMetas> fromt he top
[1:10:26] <+Audega> Box is Key
[1:10:30] <razerwo1f> Mind blown
[1:10:34] <+Wafflum> Can I Haz Box? HahaCat
[1:10:40] <ahaegotrigger> what about key
[1:10:52] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you are on top of a stop tile can you walk off of it?
[1:10:52] <TomFrank> box is key and run into door
[1:11:04] <ahaegotrigger> baba is you and has key?
[1:11:05] <Emjit> Yes @thirdpersonphil
[1:11:11] <Zedimonx5> The rules haven‚Äôt changed, just more fog of war has been lifted Jebaited
[1:11:34] <+MMetas> "Baba is you and has box" and then from the top do "box is you " from the top
[1:11:43] <+Wafflum> @thirdpersonphil Usually yes.
[1:11:52] <alrobot2014> but box is not you
[1:12:09] <Frogwash> Yeah you can
[1:12:11] <+MMetas> no no like a T you have a 2nd box and is
[1:12:30] <+MMetas> UPside down T
[1:12:31] <TheAsylumCat> much like science a revelation has been made and now the world is more complicated and a bigger headache
[1:12:32] <+TQuick101> ew
[1:12:32] <RevolverOcelot16> BABA is weak?
[1:12:38] <$Valdorick> Box is weak and has key?
[1:12:40] <+datKado> can you turn a word into a box?
[1:12:44] <%dantejoestar21> does Baba is you AND has Key not work?
[1:12:49] <spardanwarrior> @MMetas But you also need "Baba is weak" to destroy Baba and make a box
[1:13:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> teach your nieces how to play baba is you off stream. grow those brain muscles early
[1:13:06] <TomFrank> box has key and is you
[1:13:15] <EuropanLamprey> Solved it, this puzzle requires steps
[1:13:19] <RevolverOcelot16> BABA is weak and Box is Key
[1:14:14] <+MMetas> If you can first turn yourself into a box, you have two boxes to work with to replicate it
[1:14:20] <Fenlig> Baba is pregnart
[1:14:21] <+Aeoneth> YOu need Box is you
[1:14:27] <weatherreport240> Why is weak required? Can't you say "Box is Baba, Baba is you and has box" or has key?
[1:14:34] <+MMetas> So you can link both baba and box to "you" with "is"
[1:14:40] <+Aeoneth> Baba has box and box is key
[1:14:44] <$Valdorick> Baba is immutable
[1:14:47] <weatherreport240> you can't just change baba into a box?
[1:14:50] <$Valdorick> Baba can only be baba
[1:14:53] <weatherreport240> oh right
[1:15:18] <%dantejoestar21> Baba and Box is you, is Weak, Box has Key
[1:15:25] <xivilian> box is you baba has box baba is you and weak.
[1:15:39] <Emjit> So thats the 3rd time he tried the same thing?
[1:15:57] <Chatchito> Baba has box and key + Box is Baba?
[1:16:18] <weatherreport240> @plagueofgripes @dantejoestar21 comment looks promising
[1:16:28] <Antarctician> BABA IS God
[1:16:33] <+LordSDB> Baba is key? Also hey Plauge
[1:16:35] <illTemperedSeaBass> But if Baba is you, then who. was? phone???
[1:16:56] <+Billyuppercut0> Baba is key and you
[1:17:03] <EuropanLamprey> How much does Plague read chat? How much of the solution is safe to say?
[1:17:22] <TomFrank> why arent you using key
[1:17:23] <+Splatterfest> brain work slow
[1:17:35] <Palmtuna> Bad chat
[1:17:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> bad chad
[1:17:44] <EuropanLamprey> I mean, I just solved it in my own game, which is why I'm asking
[1:17:48] <%dantejoestar21> but i only just got here
[1:17:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> Chat is Simplistic
[1:17:55] <$jobbedbone> the and distributes across and when you use two nouns, so it was trying "baba is box" before
[1:18:00] <+Aeoneth> Box is key
[1:18:03] <RevolverOcelot16> ^
[1:18:05] <+Aeoneth> Baba has box
[1:18:08] <+Aeoneth> box is you
[1:18:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> wait.... does baba is you and is key works?
[1:18:23] <RevolverOcelot16> ?
[1:18:28] <Panboy> cant do box is you cause baba is baba
[1:18:29] <+Aeoneth> make a box into a key
[1:18:35] <+Aeoneth> so the box can ram the door
[1:18:35] <weatherreport240> "Baba is you and weak, baba is box, box has key looks" good to me
[1:18:37] <+MMetas> start with "baba is you and weak" "box is you" from the middle up "Baba has box" from the left down
[1:18:45] <Futurecity10> I don‚Äôt even aee@a box
[1:18:51] <Lelfro> baba is key, you walk to door?
[1:18:53] <StencilOST> has he tried baba has box and key
[1:18:58] <ThirdPersonPhil> ...And is Key
[1:18:59] <$jobbedbone> its hard when you don't have it in front of you to experiment with
[1:19:04] <+swaggopotamus> Is "Baba and Box is You" the same as "Baba is You and Box"?
[1:19:06] <+Aeoneth> if baba is key then baba will disappear
[1:19:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Lelfro that wont work. key doesnt automatically open doors unless KEY IS OPEN
[1:19:16] <ThirdPersonPhil> And is just like and has
[1:19:21] <+dybia> Does is have to be 'blank' is you, or can you just use an is to make you is box and use the and for something else
[1:19:27] <ThirdPersonPhil> and has worked right?
[1:19:43] <$jobbedbone> @KevinsLunchbox key is open top left
[1:19:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> but key is open
[1:19:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> yeah but then there is no baba
[1:20:16] <%dantejoestar21> Box is You, Box has Key and Baba?
[1:20:18] <weatherreport240> @thirdpersonphil but baba is baba, so you're stuck as baba
[1:20:23] <%bettysharkface> Waking up to point out this is what I mean cause I may be tired, but I got energy to be petty
[1:20:24] <alrobot2014> but key is not you
[1:20:39] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh wait right key is a object and not a property.... i am stupid
[1:20:43] <StencilOST> baba has key and box?
[1:20:57] <spardanwarrior> Box is you!
[1:20:58] <Chatchito> Box is Baba has Key and Box
[1:20:59] <EuropanLamprey> You need to make Baba into a Box and then the Box into a Key
[1:20:59] <xivilian> box is you!
[1:21:00] <+dybia> You is box
[1:21:06] <+MMetas> put box is you from the middle
[1:21:10] <+dybia> You have another is
[1:21:13] <+Aeoneth> box is you
[1:21:20] <+swaggopotamus> Box is Key? what does that do?
[1:21:22] <TheAsylumCat> its seems like were cloning sheep
[1:21:24] <EuropanLamprey> You have two 'is's, use them!
[1:21:24] <ThirdPersonPhil> still think the solution is die on a wall and turn into a box and then just hop inot the other side... key is useless
[1:21:30] <Chatchito> Box is you
[1:21:34] <Dutchpotato> Box is you from the top?
[1:21:34] <+MMetas> There's a 2nd is on the left you're not using
[1:21:36] <%bettysharkface> I put on my glasses to type that. Good night.
[1:21:41] <%dantejoestar21> @plagueofgripes Box is you, box has Baba and Key, Box is weak
[1:21:41] <+Aeoneth> box is you gives you control of any boxes in the level
[1:21:42] <+dybia> You is box, not box is baba
[1:21:52] <alrobot2014> infinite suffering
[1:21:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh you cant hop off
[1:21:56] <+MMetas> lol
[1:21:57] <+KityLinn> lol
[1:22:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> @ThirdPersonPhil that wouldn't work because wall is stop is unless you break that statement nothing can go onto the same tile as wall
[1:22:04] <spardanwarrior> Box is you, but do it on top of you
[1:22:05] <EuropanLamprey> If only you could put words ontop of the sentence
[1:22:06] <xivilian> box is you
[1:22:07] <JohnLemonede> Can you push words after you've become a box?
[1:22:08] <ThirdPersonPhil> no wait box cant be made not to be weak
[1:22:12] <gsoto83> oh great, here comes the minut speak
[1:22:15] <dandy_alpha> Test it on the door instead and put "box has key" when doing that.
[1:22:27] <theamazingroberto> baba is key?
[1:22:31] <gsoto83> Aren't we all like boxes mannnnnn
[1:22:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> but when you die onto a object and has spawn that thing on top of it
[1:22:35] <rendroken> bruh
[1:22:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh not on wall
[1:22:43] <ThirdPersonPhil> because stop?
[1:22:52] <mizamar> hey Plague!
[1:22:58] <ThirdPersonPhil> cause bush not stop
[1:22:58] <+Aeoneth> cuz wall is stop
[1:23:00] <EuropanLamprey> You need to become a box while Box is You
[1:23:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> .... this game is great
[1:23:28] <StridentSong> Baba is quantum state box
[1:23:30] <EuropanLamprey> I can't wait for the bonus levels
[1:23:41] <+Aeoneth> wall is stop, but bush is not stop
[1:23:59] <TheAsylumCat> would it be safe to say that this game doesn't actually have a fail state just a soft lock system
[1:23:59] <%KevinsLunchbox> that is why there is a WAIT ABUTTON
[1:24:00] <spardanwarrior> Box is Baba is You doesn't work like you think it does
[1:24:01] <EuropanLamprey> Box is not you
[1:24:03] <JonnyJug> Box is Baba
[1:24:03] <%KevinsLunchbox> WAIT button*
[1:24:07] <Chatchito> Because Box is Baba
[1:24:08] <gsoto83> OH CAN THIS BEEEEEE
[1:24:21] <EuropanLamprey> Because Box is Baba, but Box is not You
[1:24:22] <Dutchpotato> Baba is you but not box, baba ceases to be
[1:24:26] <Frogwash> (box is (baba) is you)
[1:24:29] <spardanwarrior> Box is Baba is you is not the same as Box is Baba AND you
[1:24:34] <+Aeoneth> yeah , you need to move that box is to be above you
[1:24:36] <arkv01> it's time, the box is horny and baba is box
[1:24:37] <%KevinsLunchbox> Plague, please remember there is a WAIT button on your controls
[1:24:39] <+Aeoneth> so you have control of the box
[1:24:39] <arkv01> tr
[1:24:44] <+LordSDB> Maybe Box is weak, and key, then maybe push the second box word into the wall.
[1:24:50] <@Nightbot> @Don2323 -> What? Did you think I was gone forever? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:24:57] <+RenoDeGeneric> Make Box is key and just run into the door
[1:24:58] <Autistic_Fish> become box then move bottom box to above is kay?
[1:25:03] <+Don2323> damn that bot is quick lol
[1:25:05] <spardanwarrior> Take the "box is" and move it on top of "you"?
[1:25:08] <+KityLinn> TableHere
[1:25:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> wait doesnt apply to only MOVE
[1:25:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> cant you be key instead of box and do that weird thing in front of the door?
[1:25:23] <EuropanLamprey> Doing the level before Plague is working out great for me, I've almost lost all of my hair
[1:25:31] <Huntercd> Is this the game that broke Paige?
[1:25:33] <+Aeoneth> that won't make any difference
[1:25:35] <Chatchito> Did you try Box is You?
[1:25:43] <+MMetas> 1 down "Baba has box" 1 across "Baba is you and weak" 3 up "Box is you"
[1:25:48] <+Aeoneth> move the "box is" thats over baba to be over you
[1:25:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> baba walked into the wall and drops a box. hit the wait button. box turns into baba. because time moving forward is a property in this game. important property later
[1:26:16] <Dutchpotato> You are you, you are not baba
[1:26:36] <EuropanLamprey> He's super close but keeps going in the wrong direction
[1:26:41] <+MMetas> Plague move box and is over two
[1:26:44] <+MMetas> the top ones
[1:26:53] <%KevinsLunchbox> this game has given you controls and property of those controls and it's gonna stretch those concepts as far as possible. when you forget about something simple like a wait button, your later puzzles are fucked
[1:26:59] <EuropanLamprey> HUZZAH
[1:27:00] <+MMetas> THANK YOU
[1:27:02] <+Aeoneth> because box is you
[1:27:02] <marshallventure> hey plague and chat, how are yall?
[1:27:11] <EuropanLamprey> Now for step two of the puzzle
[1:27:14] <+Aeoneth> box has baba and key now
[1:27:15] <+MMetas> You did it
[1:27:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> congrats on achieving your dreams
[1:27:31] <+LordSDB> VoHiYo @marshallventure
[1:27:36] <+dybia> Box and key is you now
[1:27:36] <Huntercd> Like a cat
[1:27:38] <+Aeoneth> SNAAAAAAKE
[1:27:42] <+KityLinn> lol
[1:27:47] <Ageingyoungrebel> wtf is this game

[1:34:10] <TheAsylumCat> oh no the timeline
[1:34:11] <$jobbedbone> you distributed has across and
[1:34:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[1:34:13] <ahaegotrigger> become keyfinite
[1:34:15] <EuropanLamprey> Well, that's one way to solve the puzzle, you are supposed to turn box into key and then make Key have baba while baba is you
[1:34:17] <Zebroneath> talk about a fever trip
[1:34:19] <alrobot2014> then the box was immortal and birthed key children
[1:34:23] <JonnyJug> Oh no

[1:35:03] <$jobbedbone> forever ababa
[1:35:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> that HAS up against the wall at the time fucked me up so hard when i did this
[1:35:06] <+Splatterfest> make a key
[1:35:15] <YakumoYomi> Well...at least you've got personality.
[1:35:18] <laserbeaming> what does weak do?
[1:35:20] <%KevinsLunchbox> att he top*
[1:35:21] <TheAsylumCat> game discriminates against the love impaired
[1:35:40] <approachingdeath> Baba is key of infinite cosmos
[1:35:40] <$jobbedbone> weak breaks you open, revealing what you have
[1:35:41] <+Splatterfest> @YakumoYomi if you can call it that
[1:35:44] <laserbeaming> Change it to Love is Weak
[1:35:46] <chambatron> Is plague gonna streamt the nindies event?
[1:35:48] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @plagueofgripes how are you holding up? Is the quaratine treating you alright?
[1:36:06] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Oh god quaratine chan
[1:36:11] <+dybia> Box is key, key has box
[1:36:12] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> What have i done
[1:36:25] <+MMetas> box has key and box?
[1:36:31] <marshallventure> hes name is literally plague. hes gonna be fine
[1:36:36] <+Unicorn_AIDS> He STARTED the plague monkaS
[1:36:38] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> neat
[1:36:39] <+firmlygraspi1> hopefully normal people will become more relatable after a few weeks indoors
[1:36:43] <%KevinsLunchbox> Plague how much toilet paper do you have tho?
[1:36:46] <$Valdorick> Oh, yeah, this one is kinda easy?
[1:36:46] <chambatron> @PlagueOfGripes will you stream the nintendo indie event?
[1:36:55] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @firmlygraspi1 we can only hope
[1:37:01] <+LunarLancaster> Plague is an introvert in a small town in the middle of nowhere. He will out last us all.
[1:37:02] <$jobbedbone> plague has the antibodies but won't share them with anybody
[1:37:13] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @kevinslunchbox nah man just shower after you shit
[1:37:19] <%KevinsLunchbox> OOF
[1:37:39] <+Splatterfest> dont worry plague when the whole world is infected ill make a trip to your house so you dont feel left out
[1:37:41] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> What is a post shit shower but a bidet with extra steps
[1:37:46] <laserbeaming> did that box place a box on the same space it's occupying?
[1:37:47] <+ElrongMcbong> ElrongMcbong subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:37:52] <+MMetas> "Box has jey and box" then "key is push" infinite keys
[1:37:54] <%KevinsLunchbox> @laserbeaming yes
[1:38:06] <EuropanLamprey> This one's simple at least
[1:38:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> toilet paper is weak
[1:38:36] <EuropanLamprey> So of course Plague is going to overthink this and get stuck for 20 minutes
[1:38:54] <+TQuick101> @EuropanLamprey with how the game is, can you blame him?
[1:38:57] <%KevinsLunchbox> i wish i was a plumber tbh. when the toilet paper runs out and people start flushing paper towels and breaking their plumbing. fuckin gold mine waiting to happen
[1:39:19] <+Branwulf> also you'd be busy installing bidets for everyone
[1:39:25] <alrobot2014> can you make an infinite key and box spawn?
[1:39:29] <laserbeaming> Oh, I think I get it
[1:39:38] <EuropanLamprey> Simple puzzles always get people because people think they are harder than they actually are
[1:39:41] <+dybia> Push box is weak up and use and to make Box has key and box
[1:40:00] <+Branwulf> box is key and push?
[1:40:36] <+TQuick101> The game has been tricking players the whole time to never think the simple solution is the right now
[1:40:43] <+TQuick101> right one*
[1:41:11] <+MMetas> move is push to key
[1:41:13] <EuropanLamprey> One more step
[1:41:16] <$jobbedbone> oh god
[1:41:26] <+dybia> Now key is push
[1:41:27] <$jobbedbone> so many keys
[1:41:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> but wait. THERES MORE
[1:41:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> the game logic runs on a tick ?
[1:41:46] <laserbeaming> infinite keys!
[1:41:46] <EuropanLamprey> HALLELUJAH
[1:41:48] <%KevinsLunchbox> yes!
[1:41:49] <$Valdorick> Yeah, that's a shockingly easy one.
[1:41:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> this game has a tick system
[1:41:54] <JonnyJug> lol
[1:41:54] <alrobot2014> infinite key spawn
[1:41:56] <EuropanLamprey> OH NO
[1:42:03] <+Branwulf> hackerman
[1:42:04] <ThirdPersonPhil> you gonna get stuck
[1:42:15] <EuropanLamprey> Plague is Key Drunk again
[1:42:21] <+MMetas> THE KEY IS TOO POWERFUL
[1:42:23] <ahaegotrigger> hell yes
[1:42:23] <%KevinsLunchbox> well
[1:42:23] <SaltyDongs> nice
[1:42:25] <alrobot2014> too many key children
[1:42:27] <$Valdorick> BABA Doesn't Like that!
[1:42:33] <laserbeaming> INFINITE KEYWORKS
[1:42:35] <+dybia> Its creating new keys every time you take a step
[1:42:37] <$jobbedbone> it can handle it
[1:42:39] <StridentSong> I love these key-based shenanigans
[1:42:46] <$jobbedbone> people have made game of life
[1:43:18] <gsoto83> wait???
[1:43:19] <ThirdPersonPhil> A wait?
[1:43:29] <+Don2323> I now miss plague having 4 hours in dark souls talking about a stack of bricks....
[1:43:34] <%KevinsLunchbox> i was going nuts in here like 20 mins ago about the wait button
[1:43:35] <%Samex_Comex> Woop woop!
[1:43:37] <+Splatterfest> ghost is move
[1:44:09] <$Valdorick> A** Wait!
[1:44:13] <JonnyJug> Pinky!
[1:44:14] <+Splatterfest> pacman gohsts
[1:44:18] <$Valdorick> ... that just seems like I said ass wait
[1:44:20] <ShineTheDiamond> Aren't you the guy who makes fun of Pat? Followed!
[1:44:41] <+TQuick101> Everyone makes fun of Pat
[1:44:45] <+KityLinn> ^
[1:44:46] <+Don2323> but everyone makes fun of pat
[1:44:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> how do we break the SKULL IS DEFEAT statement? find out
[1:44:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> does't everyone makes fun of Pat?
[1:44:57] <$jobbedbone> pat makes fun of pat
[1:44:59] <ShineTheDiamond> True, but Plague has it down to an art
[1:45:11] <+Don2323> even pat makes fun of pat
[1:45:14] <+KityLinn> if you had the N word?
[1:45:17] <+Splatterfest> what does move is push do
[1:45:26] <+KityLinn> kaitOMG
[1:45:27] <EuropanLamprey> Does Plague know the Ghosts can push words?
[1:45:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> .... you are definitely not wrong
[1:45:29] <+MMetas> Got it use the ghosts to push "is push" so it says "skull is push" vertically
[1:45:38] <+LunarLancaster> I wasn't listening, and my brain heard "If I had the n-word I can do this"
[1:46:04] <+bitstorm_> i figured it out i think
[1:46:08] <Emjit> Oh no, he has the wrong idea about 'push'
[1:46:12] <+MMetas> move ghost it push down one and you'll be in optimal position
[1:46:24] <+arancet> maybe they will push skulls?
[1:46:42] <$jobbedbone> text is always push,
[1:46:49] <+Splatterfest> the ghosts should push the skull yes
[1:46:52] <EuropanLamprey> You don't need to break up Skull is Defeat
[1:46:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> plague is using his brain juices
[1:47:04] <$jobbedbone> defeat is only for player
[1:47:06] <$Valdorick> I think Defeat only effects *you*
[1:47:12] <Daxalog> The Ghost have started to Move!
[1:47:21] <+MMetas> no but once you have "skull is move" you can actually move them yourself
[1:47:30] <%KevinsLunchbox> DEFEAT only affects things that are YOU
[1:47:31] <+MMetas> without losing
[1:48:09] <+Splatterfest> 2 skulls are looking different way
[1:48:37] <EuropanLamprey> You can't break up Skull is Defeat
[1:48:52] <+MMetas> naw they collide with text
[1:48:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> does the ghosts and with move walk back when they hit a wall?
[1:49:10] <$jobbedbone> ghost is push lets you move ghost, not lets ghost push other things
[1:49:12] <+MMetas> text has collision with items
[1:49:13] <%KevinsLunchbox> anything thats moving goes back and forth
[1:49:28] <EuropanLamprey> Yes, they gave you two ghosts for a reason
[1:49:41] <$Valdorick> ... Ghost is move, move ghosts infront of is and push, move them until they reach skull is push, push means you can't 'touch' skull, so just push skulls?
[1:49:44] <+MMetas> You can push words over there
[1:49:47] <bevyrage> 'move' is based on facing direction?
[1:49:50] <$jobbedbone> text is always push
[1:49:58] <%KevinsLunchbox> @bevyrage yes
[1:50:04] <Lelfro> wall is stop
[1:50:09] <$jobbedbone> because its up against the wall
[1:50:12] <+MMetas> SKullis against a wall
[1:50:14] <%KevinsLunchbox> WALL IS STOP
[1:50:17] <EuropanLamprey> Because it's against a wall
[1:50:30] <+MMetas> you can push the wors over there to make a sentence
[1:50:45] <+Splatterfest> move is push
[1:50:48] <+bitstorm_> can you push move thru
[1:50:49] <EuropanLamprey> How many people here are playing along in their own game?
[1:50:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> i love the baba is you music tbh
[1:50:50] <+MMetas> defeat is only defeat if you collide with it but if you push the skull you wont be defeated
[1:51:04] <+Don2323> find a way to push up over?
[1:51:06] <Chatchito> Skull is Push
[1:51:12] <TomFrank> make them move but not push
[1:51:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:51:18] <EuropanLamprey> Don't forget, you're here forever
[1:51:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> please make skull is move... that would be fun xD
[1:52:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> LMAO
[1:52:45] <%KevinsLunchbox> that was a good idea
[1:52:48] <%KevinsLunchbox> but its not gonna fly
[1:53:06] <+MMetas> Plague try having them push "is" and "push" so it reads "skull is push" down
[1:53:06] <bevyrage> what about
[1:53:19] <laserbeaming> Plague is Gripe
[1:53:23] <+MMetas> then you can remove move to stop them
[1:53:39] <Chatchito> Make them push IS PUSH under SKULL
[1:53:51] <+thackattack00> I doubt this is relevant to the puzzle but why are two skulls facing an opposite way than all the other skulls
[1:53:58] <+MMetas> Plague if you break the sentence like ghost is move then the action stops
[1:54:01] <laserbeaming> that's the solution, but let him figure it out
[1:54:05] <%KevinsLunchbox> the shame about not playing this game is you forget earlier leves like this. remember wireless? moving robots to build statements?
[1:54:22] <bevyrage> okay what about ghost is push, push ghost to be on level with skull is defeat, then remove push from ghost, then ghost is move, put ghost into skull is defeat
[1:54:22] <TomFrank> ghost is is
[1:54:31] <bevyrage> oh neat
[1:54:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> words are pushed always
[1:54:41] <$jobbedbone> push modifies the object, not what it CAN push
[1:54:46] <$jobbedbone> it should be PUSHABLE
[1:54:47] <whiteTigr> i think i got it :)
[1:54:47] <+MMetas> ye
[1:54:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> cause push is a property for them not for other tiles
[1:54:59] <bevyrage> so just ghost is move, then have them push 'is push' to 'skull'
[1:55:05] <%KevinsLunchbox> thats why the entire game there hasnt been a "TEXT IS PUSH" statement. text is always pushable
[1:55:12] <ThirdPersonPhil> text is always push
[1:55:13] <+MMetas> Yes do that one
[1:55:20] <EuropanLamprey> Anything that can move can push words
[1:55:26] <+MMetas> I wanna see the skull deathwall
[1:55:35] <$jobbedbone> you have five words so you could keep one statement with you
[1:55:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> now you know the power of Push
[1:55:57] <bevyrage> don't you need them on the other side?
[1:56:02] <DraxTD> Baba is who, @PlagueOfGripes ?
[1:56:20] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[1:56:37] <EuropanLamprey> Plague is Dog
[1:56:42] <bevyrage> that expression is the same you're making
[1:56:48] <bevyrage> become one with ghost dog
[1:56:49] <oAznoUta> you okay there buddy?
[1:56:51] <$jobbedbone> oh no
[1:57:37] <bevyrage> HUZZAH
[1:57:41] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> BLUE
[1:57:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> because its push
[1:57:44] <+MMetas> Nah you can push away defeat!
[1:57:47] <bevyrage> you can't overlap ergo you're saved from defeat
[1:57:53] <$jobbedbone> defeat is for when you occupy the same space
[1:57:58] <$jobbedbone> push prevents that
[1:57:59] <Daxalog> Kill is only on Overlap. Push dosnt cause overlap
[1:58:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> DEFEAT only kills if you go on top of it. you cant go on top of it if you're pushing it
[1:58:06] <EuropanLamprey> Skull is only Defeat if you occupy the same space as skull, push stops that from happening
[1:58:10] <Chatchito> You're not IN skull
[1:58:20] <%maledictus_faust> if you can't intersect the skull, it can't defeat you. just like drowning in water
[1:58:21] <bevyrage> woo!
[1:58:29] <whiteTigr> is it possible to do with same way, but with "skull is move"? :)
[1:58:29] <+MMetas> it's works fiiiiiiine
[1:58:30] <%KevinsLunchbox> WRONG
[1:58:30] <+Saggitori> nice feet
[1:58:36] <bevyrage> you can't enter skull when it's push, so YOU are incorrect plague
[1:58:39] <warmnoid> push has precedence over defeat and a lot of other words
[1:58:40] <+thackattack00> but you have to occupy the same space for defeat
[1:58:41] <TomFrank> the interactions seem very arbitrary
[1:58:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> Plague you're making wrong assumptions
[1:58:42] <laserbeaming> defeat triggers when you occupy the same space as the thing
[1:58:46] <+bitstorm_> prolly only one action and push has high priority
[1:58:51] <laserbeaming> It's VERY abstract
[1:58:53] <Korgororo> plague rejecting reality again CarlSmile
[1:58:54] <+arancet> yes, it is
[1:58:57] <laserbeaming> Abstract is the word
[1:58:58] <LustrousDust> certain commands have priority, its weird
[1:59:00] <bevyrage> you're equating 'touch' to 'enter'
[1:59:08] <$jobbedbone> the baby talk has surprises hidden in it :)
[1:59:13] <%maledictus_faust> baba is defeat
[1:59:19] <%KevinsLunchbox> DEFEAT only kills things on the same tile. you cannot go onto the tile as it at the same time if you're pushing it
[1:59:20] <ThirdPersonPhil> the words are not literal they are specific property, and the name is just for bumb talking
[1:59:21] <EuropanLamprey> Is Defeat only kills you if you occupy the same space as what is Defeat, push stops you from occupying the same space, it does work
[1:59:22] <Korgororo> fair enough LUL
[1:59:25] <Infeirno23> ok pat Kappa
[1:59:25] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh right the indie stuff
[1:59:26] <+arancet> yeah but nothing interesting yet
[1:59:34] <Zebroneath> Some indie games, I think.
[1:59:36] <+Saggitori> mistakes into miracles
[1:59:37] <LunarRemix> Wait baba is a girl?
[1:59:37] <$Valdorick> Vore or Peg?
[1:59:47] <Palmtuna> IT MUST BE DRAWN @PlagueOfGripes
[1:59:48] <alrobot2014> keke is a chest burster
[2:00:02] <Daxalog> Who would want KEKE? Lets be real
[2:00:08] <Chatchito> They make sense. Just gotta let go of wrong assumptions
[2:00:09] <LunarRemix> Open and ready to mate.
[2:00:15] <+LunarLancaster> KEYKEY
[2:00:27] <%maledictus_faust> fingerprint scanner
[2:00:30] <$jobbedbone> I like how only baba's eyeballs switch which one is on top
[2:00:40] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Chatchito is right. the game makes sense. if you're confused. its because you have a wrong assumption in your head
[2:01:34] <+Saggitori> push block into keke?
[2:02:05] <$jobbedbone> I think there is some disparity here; its a game based on language, but it purposefully uses inadequate vocabulary
[2:02:22] <$jobbedbone> to keep it a fun game
[2:02:39] <Daxalog> Huh!?
[2:03:00] <%bettysharkface> It's 4:11am, and for some reason, I had a dream to remind you all that retail workers are expendable, weird how that works out.
[2:03:10] <Daxalog> Baba has Moved (On) :(
[2:03:28] <cap_bon> but baba
[2:03:39] <Infeirno23> maybe try and get baba to move over the water while not being you?
[2:04:32] <Infeirno23> ok i get the has
[2:05:10] <Infeirno23> when he dies he drop a keke because he "has" one on hin
[2:05:26] <Daxalog> in*
[2:05:40] <Infeirno23> yeah
[2:06:28] <Infeirno23> maybe keke has baba?
[2:06:30] <bevyrage> just become keke after you cross both water and door?
[2:07:23] <alrobot2014> keke has baba then baba has keke after ?
[2:08:39] <Pappajimbo> baba is keke?
[2:09:15] <bevyrage> remember plague that you have both sides of that wall to shepherd your second baba
[2:11:40] <%KevinsLunchbox> just be more careful around that wall when moving both babas
[2:11:48] <+JD_Lars> Exit The Gungeon got announced and is out today
[2:12:06] <Daxalog> !uptime
[2:12:07] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 12 minutes 17 seconds
[2:12:50] <%bettysharkface> Anxiety is a layer where things that shouldn't matter do
[2:13:17] <Korgororo> never been much for puzzles of any kind LUL prefer unga bunga entertainment SMOrc
[2:13:40] <scud24> But I thought you love walls!
[2:13:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> do what you did earlier, get a baba to appear on the other side of the water and then just careful of how you move to change the statements utilizing the wall
[2:13:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> you were on the right track earlier
[2:13:57] <Chatchito> You already had it earlier. Didn't need to start over.
[2:15:30] <%KevinsLunchbox> Billy Mays: and I'm not done yet!
[2:16:26] <%KevinsLunchbox> we DID IT
[2:16:54] <Chatchito> PJSalt
[2:17:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> if thats bothering you you're going to LOVE the later puzzles
[2:17:06] <Korgororo> clap nice work
[2:17:11] <$jobbedbone> its like setting up a mario maker level
[2:17:29] <warmnoid> if you hated that one, the bonus level for this world is going to take you for a ride
[2:17:36] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[2:18:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> WALL IS STOP
[2:18:05] <ThirdPersonPhil> this is a great one
[2:18:07] <%KevinsLunchbox> ROCK IS PUSH
[2:18:14] <ThirdPersonPhil> push and stop
[2:18:21] <laserbeaming> you have to be inside wall to win
[2:18:22] <shadow1man9> Yep
[2:18:23] <PoisonFrame> your not entering the blocks
[2:18:23] <warmnoid> push and stop take priority
[2:18:23] <$jobbedbone> yes
[2:18:24] <MillaMoks> yes
[2:18:25] <alrobot2014> this is the problem you had with the skulls
[2:18:28] <EuropanLamprey> You can't oberlap with anything with push or stop
[2:18:30] <+jepupu> You can't get in the same tile. Wall doesn't let you in, rock moves out of way
[2:18:37] <%KevinsLunchbox> in order to WIN you have to go onto the same tile, you cant go onto the same tile if its STOP
[2:18:43] <MillaMoks> push and stop are top level commands, they take priority over win
[2:18:48] <%KevinsLunchbox> stop having wrong assumptions!
[2:18:51] <StridentSong> You have to be able to overlap the WIN tile
[2:18:53] <$jobbedbone> you have to intersect with something to win
[2:19:00] <laserbeaming> Wall is Rock would let you do something
[2:19:09] <+DiabloDeAzul> push it to the wall
[2:19:23] <$jobbedbone> push and stop prevent intersection in different ways
[2:19:27] <ThirdPersonPhil> the goal is to win... what you asking for is the solution
[2:19:53] <$jobbedbone> rock is push
[2:19:53] <resloxxx> IT DOES THO LUL
[2:19:55] <%KevinsLunchbox> but wait! THERES MORE
[2:20:11] <scud24> Now you are FREE!
[2:20:14] <%KevinsLunchbox> FREEDOM
[2:20:18] <laserbeaming> you can make baba into rock?
[2:20:20] <Korgororo> plague is too smart for his own good
[2:20:30] <+bread_assassin> A Baba army
[2:20:40] <StarlitStunner> Baba is sbfpRage
[2:20:52] <scud24> Rock is you?
[2:20:58] <+fingalights> I remember doing this one, but i don't remember how to do this one
[2:21:02] <ThirdPersonPhil> this is fucking brilliant... assuming there is a solution which i would expect to be
[2:21:05] <arkv01> become the wind, baba
[2:21:12] <Chatchito> Rock is...
[2:21:12] <Emjit> He really gets frustrated easily
[2:21:23] <%bettysharkface> What's that smell? It's anxiety
[2:21:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> get fucked brain
[2:21:41] <%KevinsLunchbox> you can actually pinpoint the moment his BRAIN breaks in half
[2:21:51] <laserbeaming> The logic is consistent, it's just VERY abstract
[2:21:51] <Korgororo> just try some stuff out SeemsGood
[2:21:52] <Emjit> The logic is consistent, you just dont understand it
[2:21:58] <PoisonFrame> the skull level
[2:22:06] <+fingalights> You always win when you are inside the thing
[2:22:14] <+HarryWizard> well ya can't touch it to win cuz you're pushing it right
[2:22:31] <Dragonfighter46> push is win?
[2:22:31] <Saterion> "YOU" is the only important here
[2:22:35] <scud24> If rock is win, you must become win, then you will be winner
[2:22:53] <+Splatterfest> you is win
[2:23:14] <laserbeaming> Rock can be Baba
[2:23:20] <EuropanLamprey> You can't remove the Ice, you need to solve this with only the words
[2:23:24] <Saterion> You can be ROCK
[2:23:29] <arkv01> become rock lee
[2:23:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> baba can be you and win right?
[2:23:36] <$jobbedbone> remember how you stacked the keys @PlagueOfGripes
[2:23:49] <scud24> You is Fence
[2:23:50] <resloxxx> He literally just said the answer LUL
[2:23:55] <DraxTD> Think like Paige, @PlagueOfGripes , you can DO IT
[2:23:55] <GarbageQueenEllie> push away wall?
[2:23:56] <EuropanLamprey> You can win this without manipulating any object, just the words
[2:23:59] <+burgerdicks> rock is you?
[2:24:08] <+mankeyfigh> Oh he‚Äôs so close
[2:24:09] <laserbeaming> Well, Rock is You is valid, specially if Rock is also Win
[2:24:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> we've got 2 IS words
[2:24:30] <Korgororo> testing stuff to see what happens always helps - no penalty
[2:24:32] <scud24> Fence is Love, Fence is Life
[2:24:34] <Chatchito> Rock is You + Rock is Win huggRainbow
[2:24:41] <%Samex_Comex> Rock on!
[2:24:47] <DraxTD> do... do they want you to complete the wall?
[2:24:50] <arkv01> the year is 20XX...
[2:24:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> you can push the rocks
[2:24:56] <+mankeyfigh> There IS only a few viable combinations you can try
[2:25:01] <SvenHolgersson> Hi Plague how's your apocalypse going
[2:25:01] <%KevinsLunchbox> but
[2:25:04] <%KevinsLunchbox> you can push the wors
[2:25:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> words*
[2:25:21] <%KevinsLunchbox> ICE IS STOP
[2:25:24] <%KevinsLunchbox> that ice aint moving
[2:25:38] <%bettysharkface> Every problem makes more sense after facing something hardeer
[2:25:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> i love this
[2:25:56] <Frogwash> This one sucks
[2:25:56] <+burgerdicks> wall is win?
[2:26:11] <scud24> Wall is wall
[2:26:12] <+stephane3012> can you push the rock unto you?
[2:26:41] <%KevinsLunchbox> nah
[2:26:49] <%KevinsLunchbox> ICE isnt going anywhere
[2:26:56] <Chatchito> Playing this while tired is hardcore difficulty
[2:27:16] <Luizabd> Can't you make rock is wall?
[2:27:17] <+mankeyfigh> Just start trying crap
[2:27:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> words are pushable tho
[2:27:24] <EuropanLamprey> You don't need to move the rocks, Ice or Wall to win, just the words
[2:27:26] <scud24> Just start trying things even if nothing seems to work. You‚Äôll figure something out
[2:27:37] <%KevinsLunchbox> interact with the words
[2:27:43] <JakeIsNotGross> True change starts with YOU.
[2:27:51] <Luizabd> rock is wall then wall is win no?
[2:27:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you have win you can win
[2:27:54] <exglebster> that's a DSP moment if I ever seen one
[2:28:02] <$jobbedbone> rocks to baba?
[2:28:20] <EuropanLamprey> Move the rocks into a shape of a penis to show the game who is boss
[2:28:26] <%KevinsLunchbox> im having a lot of fun tbh. this is delicious
[2:28:30] <alrobot2014> can rock is you?
[2:28:33] <PulverKong> you can make a rock penis
[2:28:33] <+Splatterfest> put is above you and win above i
[2:28:35] <arkv01> can Baba... birth rock?
[2:28:36] <scud24> @exglebster DarkSidePlague
[2:28:44] <Luizabd> Change the wall to win
[2:28:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Luizabd WRONG
[2:28:52] <Luizabd> it's not a real wall
[2:28:54] <Chatchito> Rock is You + Rock is Win
[2:28:57] <Luizabd> really?
[2:28:57] <laserbeaming> Rock is You, Rock is Win
[2:28:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> you can move the is's, right? Maybe make a vertical thing
[2:29:03] <+Splatterfest> win is you
[2:29:11] <EuropanLamprey> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[2:29:17] <SvenHolgersson> how can this be
[2:29:19] <+saltytyrz> Wall is...
[2:29:26] <Dragonfighter46> can you make something with push?
[2:29:31] <%KevinsLunchbox> im smiling big smiles
[2:29:49] <arkv01> ohhh
[2:29:51] <ladylow101> wooliePOYO
[2:29:54] <laserbeaming> I think he's ignoring us to punish our backseating
[2:30:02] <EuropanLamprey> This one is so simple and Plague is overthinking it so freakin' hard
[2:30:05] <+AbnormalVoid> walk into the wall then wait
[2:30:07] <alrobot2014> that's cool
[2:30:16] <alrobot2014> the wall constantly alternating
[2:30:23] <+AbnormalVoid> oh, didn't see the stop under the chat lmao
[2:30:25] <arkv01> ba ais wall?
[2:30:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> i didnt see that when i did this puzzle
[2:30:32] <Korgororo> plagues brain is so huge it's killing him BibleThump
[2:30:35] <warmnoid> i can't blame him for overthinking it since you don't normally win in the way this level wants you to
[2:30:37] <bevyrage> rock is baba?
[2:30:38] <scud24> Plague has successfully made yet another Fence...
[2:30:39] <Luizabd> Oh i didn't see the rules down there
[2:30:45] <EuropanLamprey> If only there was two spaces above You to interact with
[2:30:47] <+burgerdicks> wall is you, baba is you?
[2:30:57] <laserbeaming> Rock is You, Rock is Win
[2:31:01] <arkv01> rock is isis ScaredyCat
[2:31:13] <Chatchito> ROCK IS YUUUUU
[2:31:15] <+fingalights> Rock is not not win
[2:31:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, Mighty ISIS
[2:31:21] <Solokaldaka> rooOWO I think i got it
[2:31:22] <SvenHolgersson> win is possible
[2:31:29] <SvenHolgersson> Plague is strong
[2:31:39] <$jobbedbone> maybe if you get two babas stacked and then change them to rocks and then make rock is win while you're rock?
[2:31:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> we've got 2. count em 2 IS words to use
[2:31:43] <ladylow101> Plague please
[2:31:50] <laserbeaming> now do Rock is Win
[2:31:53] <warmnoid> LUL
[2:31:54] <+Splatterfest> lol
[2:31:56] <+AbnormalVoid> YOU ARE THE ROCK, ROCK IS WIN
[2:31:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:31:57] <Korgororo> LUL
[2:31:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> Baba is win
[2:31:58] <EuropanLamprey> YES IT DOES
[2:31:58] <+Splatterfest> plague you smarty
[2:31:59] <arkv01> I REFUSE LUL
[2:32:02] <%KevinsLunchbox> YES IT DOES
[2:32:02] <laserbeaming> It doeS!
[2:32:02] <+AbnormalVoid> YES IT DOES
[2:32:03] <+fingalights> Plague, you've won like that before
[2:32:06] <%KevinsLunchbox> STOP HAVING WRONG ASSUMPTIONS
[2:32:09] <+Infernal_Dalek> Rock is You and You is win
[2:32:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> YOU'VE WON MULTIPLE PUZZLES LIKE THAT
[2:32:14] <+DiabloDeAzul> you ARE the win statement
[2:32:15] <warmnoid> there's a few levels before this where you had to win like that
[2:32:16] <scud24> Fence is you
[2:32:17] <bevyrage> to WIN you only need YOU on WIN
[2:32:17] <Artista_AF> i man you won, so it worked LUL
[2:32:19] <EuropanLamprey> Rock is You and You is Win
[2:32:20] <GilfEnthusiast> You occupy the same space as win
[2:32:20] <Luizabd> You are win
[2:32:20] <+mankeyfigh> Ha
[2:32:25] <laserbeaming> Literally one of the first puzzles requires you to be win
[2:32:25] <arkv01> this makes sense on primary school imagination bullshit kinda way
[2:32:26] <ladylow101> Win is win
[2:32:29] <+FadingEmber> Rock = Win; You = Rock;
[2:32:30] <+LunarLancaster> Because you are on the same tile as something with a win condition
[2:32:35] <+Splatterfest> i told you plague
[2:32:39] <%KevinsLunchbox> @PlagueOfGripes do you remember an earlier puzzle where you made BABA IS YOU and YOU IS WIN
[2:32:39] <Korgororo> plague really is rejecting reality LUL
[2:32:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> its the exact same
[2:32:42] <+craftyraichu> If rock is win and you are rock, then you win
[2:32:43] <exglebster> dude's a writer and an artist but got creativity of a roach NotLikeThis
[2:32:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> you is a end statement... they are marked witht he backgrop
[2:32:50] <EuropanLamprey> You're gonna love this one
[2:32:50] <laserbeaming> It makes sense plague! You are just thinking in very concrete terms
[2:32:53] <+FadingEmber> oh no this one
[2:32:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> *backdrop
[2:32:55] <+arcturusblade> oh god this puzzle
[2:32:57] <$jobbedbone> every square which is a rock = win
[2:32:59] <+DiabloDeAzul> the stop command prevents you from touching the wall, the push command prevents you from touching the rock
[2:32:59] <warmnoid> here we go with this one
[2:33:00] <+AbnormalVoid> because you is a descriptor not an actor @PlagueOfGripes
[2:33:01] <Chatchito> I bet you've done it before with Baba is Win
[2:33:07] <+burgerdicks> multiple bubbled boxes cant set conditions
[2:33:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Oh, I see. So Win has to be A, and You has to be A as well.
[2:33:10] <EuropanLamprey> How can Plague win and still have Johns?
[2:33:11] <+mankeyfigh> This will only get worse
[2:33:11] <Emjit> 'everything i dont get is bad'
[2:33:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> Plague is hitting WOOLIE levels of wrong assumptions
[2:33:18] <+AbnormalVoid> you can't transform a descriptor with another descriptor @PlagueOfGripes
[2:33:26] <+fingalights> But you then are win
[2:33:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> the game is about breaking components
[2:33:31] <+DiabloDeAzul> You should approach it as a programmer rather than a designer
[2:33:32] <arkv01> this game is an exploration in the insanity of the developer
[2:33:33] <$jobbedbone> trust the dev, he knows how to keep you on the rails
[2:33:37] <+Splatterfest> plague's crazy talk
[2:33:42] <Korgororo> it's always humanizing to see someone you respect be so wrong
[2:33:56] <laserbeaming> Its internal logic is consistent
[2:34:00] <%KevinsLunchbox> its not arbitraru
[2:34:00] <SvenHolgersson> Plague is angry
[2:34:01] <+AbnormalVoid> it's all been established earlier on, it's very consistent lmao
[2:34:01] <bevyrage> you're getting frustrated because you're trying to apply old rules to new puzzles
[2:34:06] <Luizabd> It's the same rules since the start of the game
[2:34:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Baba and Keke is bukake?
[2:34:14] <alrobot2014> if two babas touch the world ends
[2:34:18] <%KevinsLunchbox> @PlagueOfGripes the logic of the game is consistent. you're making wrong assumptions
[2:34:25] <+Splatterfest> monty python bunnies
[2:34:32] <SvenHolgersson> Just like in Frisky Dingo
[2:34:36] <+fingalights> now THIS one I hate
[2:34:38] <SvenHolgersson> WHERE ARTE THE KNIVES?!
[2:34:40] <Emjit> If he struggles with the previous puzzles he is never going to solve this one
[2:34:44] <arkv01> just watch plague is going to smash this one
[2:35:08] <+fingalights> I liked the last one, This one is the one I hate
[2:35:15] <+Splatterfest> smashed it
[2:35:23] <warmnoid> i love and hate this one
[2:35:27] <scud24> Roving bands of death machine rabbits... I sense another Plague animation in the works!
[2:35:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> think of you as a invisible object on top of the thing you are controlling
[2:35:35] <%KevinsLunchbox> so an hour ago I tried to explain how wait works thinking about this puzzle. this is going to be a doozy
[2:35:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Huck Yuk, I love MURDER
[2:35:55] <+MMetas> Make it so baba is push and push them over?
[2:35:57] <Chatchito> I got stuck on this for a long while
[2:35:59] <SvenHolgersson> Goofy laugh
[2:36:00] <EuropanLamprey> Plague is reaching Salt levels Woolie could only dream of
[2:36:02] <+Jaysky> Baba is Baby, Baby is Loss
[2:36:04] <+MMetas> then make babas into keke
[2:36:09] <PoisonFrame> baba is push
[2:36:19] <arkv01> yas
[2:36:21] <Korgororo> I like how plague falls deeper into insanity reaching a new level of sanity but then descends further
[2:36:31] <+MMetas> no wait
[2:36:32] <+mankeyfigh> Yay
[2:36:34] <+MMetas> baba can only be baba
[2:36:45] <+FadingEmber> BABA is BABA tho
[2:36:54] <%KevinsLunchbox> if you're playing baba is you and you haven't realized the game has an internal tick system this puzzle is a game ender
[2:37:30] <arkv01> you is baba?
[2:37:31] <+mankeyfigh> Internal tick system?
[2:37:35] <+FadingEmber> LUL
[2:37:38] <Korgororo> LUL
[2:37:41] <SvenHolgersson> LMAO
[2:37:54] <Chatchito> LUL
[2:37:55] <Cakesenemy> Oh shit, this was actually the level i got stuck on
[2:37:55] <ThirdPersonPhil> and early he was saying the devs didnt tough the leves correctly XD
[2:38:03] <Arth__> yankee
[2:38:18] <Emjit> @mankeyfigh the game processes actions in 'turns'
[2:38:25] <arkv01> time to remove the poor bean ribs
[2:38:25] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:38:28] <laserbeaming> Rib is Gone
[2:38:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> Remeber that time Johnny Joestar had to learn to kill himself in order to win the fight? Thats this puzzle.
[2:38:28] <+Jaysky> I thought Baba was sheep?
[2:38:33] <Korgororo> LUL LUL
[2:38:37] <+AbnormalVoid> Baba sucks Self
[2:38:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Keke, you are not me, are you crying
[2:39:04] <+fingalights> I almost got it once
[2:39:18] <+Infernal_Dalek> Creepy uncle joe gonna feel up on you
[2:39:27] <laserbeaming> Plague gets political when he's mad? That's a new one for me
[2:39:33] <+FadingEmber> Pushing objects won't cause defeat
[2:39:37] <Korgororo> LUL
[2:39:41] <+MMetas> YOu can push away defeat!
[2:39:41] <Frogwash> You don't touch them since you push them
[2:39:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> this again?
[2:39:42] <+AbnormalVoid> cause you have to stand on them for them to defeat you
[2:39:47] <SvenHolgersson> WHAT DO YOU MEANNN
[2:39:49] <Arth__> medicare for all, is that even possible with those insane prices for medicine and healthcare? In other countries healthcare and medicine are a right and profit on it is limited.
[2:39:49] <LunarRemix> You aren't touching them, Plague the last two puzzles taught you that.
[2:39:50] <+AbnormalVoid> it's why you can't win when something is push
[2:39:51] <laserbeaming> Plague has gone mad
[2:39:52] <alrobot2014> same as with the rocks with win
[2:39:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> and defeat is GRASS. not baba
[2:39:54] <+MMetas> HOW CAN THIS BE
[2:39:57] <Korgororo> it's the same way you can't win if you push something
[2:39:58] <PoisonFrame> your not on the same space as them
[2:39:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> you dont stand on baba if you push baba
[2:39:59] <+Infernal_Dalek> You gotta be on top of them for defeat
[2:40:03] <+AbnormalVoid> IT MAKES SENSE
[2:40:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> you dont touch it its the force
[2:40:07] <Luizabd> you're techiniclly not on the same square as baba
[2:40:10] <PoisonFrame> its been like that for 5 levels now
[2:40:12] <EuropanLamprey> DEFEAT IS ONLY DEFEAT IF YOU OVERLAP WITH THEM PUSH MEANS YOU CANT OVERLAP
[2:40:14] <+AbnormalVoid> YOU'RE NOT ON IT, YOU'RE NEXT TO IT
[2:40:16] <resloxxx> Pepega
[2:40:18] <laserbeaming> Defeat and Win only trigger when you are inside the thing
[2:40:24] <arkv01> ride that sheep
[2:40:28] <+AbnormalVoid> yeehaw
[2:40:33] <alrobot2014> you can ride sheep?
[2:40:34] <SvenHolgersson> I BET YOU DID
[2:40:36] <arkv01> man I would love to ride sheep...
[2:40:37] <Korgororo> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:40:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> awesome
[2:40:43] <laserbeaming> That's fucking adorable
[2:40:57] <Korgororo> that's pretty cool
[2:40:57] <sangi53> I'm gonna use a giant sheep in my shadowrun campaign, thank you for the idea
[2:40:58] <arkv01> oh lawd
[2:41:04] <exglebster> probably
[2:41:07] <+Jaysky> Bleep bleep
[2:41:09] <Korgororo> yeah I'm sure CarlSmile
[2:41:23] <Chatchito> That explains a lot
[2:41:47] <PoisonFrame> does baba touching it ount as win
[2:42:08] <ThirdPersonPhil> only if baba is you
[2:42:25] <+craftyraichu> Could they move "Flag is Win" over to you?
[2:42:38] <Korgororo> push is grass ?
[2:42:38] <+psydaku> why not baba is push is you
[2:43:07] <Korgororo> PogChamp PogChamp
[2:43:24] <+mankeyfigh> I don‚Äôt think he can touch keke is you at all
[2:43:46] <+fingalights> Do you know about the Waiting button?
[2:44:27] <ahaegotrigger> you insta lose I think
[2:44:31] <ThirdPersonPhil> that is not rabbit, that is baba
[2:45:43] <+Jaysky> Baba is not Defeat, Baba is Best is Baba
[2:45:48] <%Samex_Comex> I want to touch baba
[2:46:07] <arkv01> can you push baba?
[2:46:35] <Explodincatz> it gets worse later
[2:46:36] <laserbeaming> Plague, the rules are consistent
[2:46:50] <LunarRemix> They super are.
[2:47:08] <+AbnormalVoid> they're set up in a way where you need to figure out the rule, that's the puzzle
[2:47:13] <Emjit> You are supposed to remember the rules for future puzzles
[2:47:23] <+AbnormalVoid> because you're being unreasonable Kappa
[2:47:39] <+mankeyfigh> You‚Äôve gotta remember the rules
[2:47:49] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:47:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> You're making wrong assumptions
[2:47:52] <arkv01> you guys are standing on that high ground of having solved and knowing the rules, when you haven't figured it out yet it's a different world
[2:47:55] <Korgororo> that's what unreasonable people say CarlSmile
[2:47:56] <+cinder_chan> I think he got away with it plague
[2:47:59] <laserbeaming> Ok, no dickwaddery
[2:48:04] <Sielas> It's a puzzle game so it's made to frustrate you Kappa
[2:48:06] <theidealheight> Only in the subredits, guys
[2:48:13] <Sielas> Big Paige Energy
[2:48:21] <GarbageQueenEllie> hmm, maybe tell the babas to move over and take flag function
[2:48:22] <+mankeyfigh> It‚Äôs frustrating seeing you frustrated
[2:48:23] <sangi53> "when you don't get mad you lose twice"
[2:48:27] <%KevinsLunchbox> are you prepared to kill yourself to achieve victory?
[2:48:28] <EuropanLamprey> You need to not be you and be pushed across the grass then set it up to make Keke you again once you're on the otherside
[2:49:17] <arkv01> what happens when baba touches flag?
[2:49:23] <warmnoid> nothing
[2:49:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> Johnny Joestar: Now I know where to aim! *shoots self in head*
[2:49:28] <+cinder_chan> cant you push the babas over and then make baba and keke you?
[2:49:57] <warmnoid> you're on the right track
[2:49:59] <GarbageQueenEllie> holy shit you did it
[2:50:06] <+fingalights> Life continues even when you die
[2:50:10] <%KevinsLunchbox> REMEMBER THAT TIME I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE WAIT BUTTON
[2:50:11] <alrobot2014> that's pretty cool
[2:50:13] <EuropanLamprey> DING DING DING
[2:50:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> fucking shit!
[2:50:16] <Sielas> @fingalights that's deep

[2:50:27] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:50:30] <ThirdPersonPhil> ooh look an epiphany
[2:50:34] <theidealheight> It always worked like that!!!!
[2:50:46] <EuropanLamprey> Plague, I don't think we're the ones being adversarial
[2:50:51] <sangi53> why is kiki is flag bad?
[2:50:53] <+mankeyfigh> It‚Äôs not new it‚Äôs new to you
[2:50:59] <Korgororo> plague is feeling spirited again SeemsGood
[2:51:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:51:20] <theidealheight> Antagonizing is chat and win
[2:51:27] <arkv01> I dunno it does sound like you guys are ganging up on him just cause you know the solution
[2:51:37] <+AbnormalVoid> no keke is flag, you are still keke
[2:51:41] <+AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[2:51:43] <sprintmucho> Human//animal frustrations are fascinating//intriguing.
[2:51:56] <+craftyraichu> Kiki is Flag, Flag is Win?
[2:52:02] <cap_bon> But Baba!
[2:52:06] <Emjit> @arkv01 He's just making unreasonable assumptions about the game and getting frustrated because the game doesn't live up to those assumptions
[2:52:07] <Luizabd> what if you push the babas one square down?
[2:52:07] <+fingalights> This game drains your brain.
[2:52:10] <PulverKong> isn't it fun sitting solving puzzles with a bunch of smug knowitalls who are looking at a walkthrough?
[2:52:10] <EuropanLamprey> Hey, I was able to beat this puzzle faster, that makes me a better human being than him thus I must let him know
[2:52:34] <+AbnormalVoid> that'd do it
[2:52:38] <Huntercd> Does that say eat def ass?
[2:52:40] <%KevinsLunchbox> @PulverKong implying some of us already played through these levels
[2:52:42] <+mankeyfigh> He‚Äôs pretty close to solving it know
[2:52:43] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[2:52:50] <+fingalights> Yeah, that happens to me to. I can only play this 2 or 3 hours
[2:52:52] <theidealheight> I havent even got to this part lmao
[2:52:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> BUHH
[2:52:53] <+MMetas> LUL LUL
[2:52:54] <sangi53> nice
[2:52:55] <warmnoid> lmao
[2:52:56] <%KevinsLunchbox> LUL
[2:52:58] <%Samex_Comex> plagueChirei
[2:52:59] <EuropanLamprey> I'm not on Youtube, I'm doing it in my own game as you play
[2:52:59] <$jobbedbone> I am like that :)
[2:52:59] <KinataKnight> Primaries are delayed for me in my state wolskComfy
[2:52:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> why you assume we are all cheaters?
[2:53:00] <spongeofmystery> I love you man
[2:53:00] <+AbnormalVoid> He's onto us
[2:53:04] <+Jaysky> I got nothing from what you just said
[2:53:07] <Korgororo> plagues doing fine but he just thinks too much without even trying things
[2:53:07] <%KevinsLunchbox> tbh it took me like 40 mins to solve this puzzle
[2:53:07] <laserbeaming> It's not a game to play for long periods of time
[2:53:10] <theidealheight> I cant belive eyou did a perfect imitation of us
[2:53:12] <+FadingEmber> This legit took me a couple of hours
[2:53:17] <+mankeyfigh> I‚Äôm not even trying to solve it as I watch
[2:53:20] <Sielas> Plague is malding so hard
[2:53:28] <PulverKong> Paige made this game famous
[2:53:30] <arkv01> chat what did we say about not spitting when you scream PunOko
[2:53:42] <PulverKong> and you are all being Pats
[2:53:43] <EuropanLamprey> To be fair, the actual solution I found seems like a mistake, so IDK
[2:54:02] <GarbageQueenEllie> perhaps remove middle baba?
[2:54:15] <vincerocmm> brain blast
[2:54:16] <Hoanui> this game is weird because you're not really controlling YOU, you're sending commands out to the universe, and then it's filtering those through the established rules
[2:54:17] <arkv01> yeah it looks like theres one baba too many here
[2:55:17] <Sielas> ahreleChung
[2:55:21] <+AbnormalVoid> shikka shikka shikka
[2:55:22] <%Samex_Comex> Ew
[2:55:22] <theidealheight> Yeah rub it good
[2:55:26] <Sielas> Not for long with that agressive rubbing
[2:55:28] <PulverKong> ASMR with plague here
[2:55:30] <arkv01> get some food baba
[2:55:39] <+AbnormalVoid> we're here for the rubbing, not the game
[2:55:45] <Hoanui> plague is eat
[2:56:10] <+AbnormalVoid> you are not keke
[2:56:11] <Sielas> You're not the flag
[2:56:11] <sangi53> because keke is you not flag is you
[2:56:12] <+AbnormalVoid> you are you
[2:56:12] <laserbeaming> nothing is you
[2:56:14] <+fingalights> You are not Keke
[2:56:17] <+AbnormalVoid> nothing is you
[2:56:18] <alrobot2014> no because You do not exist
[2:56:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> you not flag
[2:56:22] <+MMetas> because you are NOT flag
[2:56:24] <Luizabd> You are nothjing
[2:56:27] <%KevinsLunchbox> YOU is nothing
[2:56:27] <+MMetas> you are YOU not Keke
[2:56:27] <+craftyraichu> Not, Kiki is flag, you are nothing
[2:56:28] <Frogwash> keke is not you
[2:56:29] <arkv01> keke is dead
[2:56:29] <laserbeaming> you are nothing right now
[2:56:30] <warmnoid> you don't control anything so you lose
[2:56:34] <sangi53> yes
[2:56:51] <Sielas> @PlagueOfGripes lose the concept of self, it's meaningless without the rest of the world
[2:56:51] <PGFontana> i'm stuck in this stage too
[2:56:58] <Sielas> real nihilism hours
[2:57:02] <Dragonfighter46> You is flag is win?
[2:57:06] <+fingalights> Did I even beat this one?
[2:57:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> this is a toughie
[2:57:17] <%KevinsLunchbox> this puzzle is not easy
[2:57:25] <sangi53> yeah I honestly don't know how to do this
[2:57:30] <OzzySnek> Oh hello. I have stumbled upon a cool stream.
[2:57:37] <PulverKong> this is like 1 paige and 233 Pat's smugly commenting on it
[2:58:03] <Sielas> @PulverKong chat already smugly comments on Paige's gameplay tho
[2:58:07] <sangi53> oh fuck
[2:58:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> Do what Johnny Joestar did and kill yourself to achieve victory
[2:58:12] <sangi53> I think I just got it
[2:58:21] <PulverKong> @Sielas they do but Pat out-smugs them
[2:58:23] <+fingalights> I didn't LUL, I gave up on this level and did half of the rest of the game
[2:58:27] <Sielas> Plague is Defeat
[2:58:33] <sprintmucho> <baba//meme//plague> is hungry. Solution: acquire sustenance//fuel
[2:58:35] <laserbeaming> You + Defeat makes the stuff die
[2:58:40] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes How are you?
[2:58:51] <Frogwash> Can baba move keke if it's not you?
[2:58:53] <+FadingEmber> @PulverKong so are you a Pat or Paige then
[2:58:55] <laserbeaming> Babas are You and Defeat at the same time, deleting them
[2:59:06] <$jobbedbone> THE SUN IS DOWN
[2:59:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> SUN is DOWN
[2:59:11] <PulverKong> @FadingEmber somewhere in the middle because i've never played this game
[2:59:18] <Korgororo> it's called being tired CarlSmile
[2:59:18] <+AbnormalVoid> this game is honestly more about testing hypotheses than anything
[2:59:21] <arkv01> I tihnk you need a minifridge and microwave in your room
[2:59:28] <SpookyBeef7> To be fair, this game is taxing mentally.
[2:59:29] <+AbnormalVoid> it's a very good science game
[2:59:30] <Sielas> Is there a new Plague Sundowning meme I don't know?
[2:59:37] <%KevinsLunchbox> that and you are piling up wrong assumptions in your head which s hurting you long term
[2:59:39] <cap_bon> Baba is You slowly smooths your brain as you play it
[3:00:00] <$jobbedbone> @Sielas bleedover from Paige's stream
[3:00:04] <GarbageQueenEllie> Does punching your brain make it less smooth, thus making you smarter?
[3:00:17] <alrobot2014> can you become flag while not existing?
[3:00:19] <vincerocmm> you can become baba
[3:00:22] <+Jaysky> Can confirm it does @garbagequeenellie
[3:00:39] <+MMetas> @vincerocmm You explode when you become baba
[3:00:39] <+Jaysky> At least I think so NotLikeThis
[3:00:42] <vincerocmm> wait may be not
[3:01:12] <cap_bon> Im Baba *explodes*
[3:01:20] <+cinder_chan> I feel like plague is overthinking the ending here
[3:01:52] <$jobbedbone> just ride baba across Kappa
[3:02:11] <+MMetas> is there a way you can make yourself not you and get pushed accross?
[3:02:36] <%KevinsLunchbox> that wall being there is preventing an easy solution ,keep trying other places
[3:02:36] <+ThePayphone> a relaxing stream
[3:02:48] <vincerocmm> can baba push flag?
[3:03:05] <%KevinsLunchbox> @vincerocmm FLAG cannot move because FLAG IS PUSH isnt in the puzzle
[3:03:12] <cap_bon> some puzzles are really really restrictive in how they want you to solve them
[3:03:16] <Fdrank> pretend it's a farm
[3:03:24] <vincerocmm> hmmmm
[3:03:48] <+fingalights> I never solved this one, I went to most of the other levels and forgot about this one.
[3:03:49] <arkv01> can we become flag?
[3:03:55] <warmnoid> there's 2 ways to solve this one that i know of
[3:04:04] <EuropanLamprey> Many later puzzles have a specific solution
[3:04:08] <+Jaysky> Uh ACHTUALLY
[3:04:09] <+MMetas> Oh plague I got it, stagger it so you push you off of the bottom then havt the baba's push you and the words accross so the line up together on that back wall
[3:04:10] <sangi53> LUL
[3:04:11] <missingangle> Oh, Plague, if only you were as smart as I Kappa
[3:04:12] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL
[3:04:14] <warmnoid> LUL
[3:04:16] <arkv01> TPFufun hell yeah
[3:04:50] <%KevinsLunchbox> tbh having 200 people in here is a distraction. I solved this alone in a dark room muttering to myself for 40 mins
[3:04:59] <+Jaysky> Baba's eat grass
[3:05:00] <+MMetas> sorry not back wall, the far right wall
[3:05:01] <%Samex_Comex> Gr Ass
[3:05:37] <Dragonfighter46> What if you use baba to move keke from you and use push in keke?
[3:05:39] <+MMetas> the far indent can be used to make them line up again
[3:05:46] <EuropanLamprey> You can't win by manipulating the flag or the win statement, you need to get Keke over the grass without dying
[3:06:01] <+MMetas> so long as you push the bottom out the babas could push you yeah?
[3:06:04] <%KevinsLunchbox> DEFEAT only affects things that are YOU
[3:06:10] <delta278899> baba is you?
[3:06:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> so what if you killed yourself and became nothing?
[3:06:17] <PulverKong> What kind of insane minds think up these puzzles
[3:06:24] <alrobot2014> if baba is you then baba explode
[3:06:39] <EuropanLamprey> Is this the puzzle that teaches you the revive technique?
[3:06:45] <+ThePayphone> RICK is PICKLE
[3:06:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> @EuropanLamprey yes
[3:06:56] <+AbnormalVoid> cause baba is defeat
[3:07:00] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> if you are defeat what you is expode
[3:07:03] <+Jaysky> But what if... Explode?
[3:07:14] <laserbeaming> They explode because Baba is Defeat. If something is You and is also defeat, it explodes
[3:07:25] <+AbnormalVoid> and any thing that is you that is defeat explodes
[3:07:27] <ThirdPersonPhil> Keke is tired
[3:07:28] <+MMetas> Can you use the baba's to move "you" back into place?
[3:07:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> I'd be more comfortable calling that the "Reborn" technique
[3:07:35] <vincerocmm> ba ba is ke ke?
[3:07:37] <+Jaysky> What if the puzzle is teaching us to accept Baba's imminent death as Baba only lives for so long?
[3:07:40] <%KevinsLunchbox> this is a revive technique
[3:07:44] <Dragonfighter46> What if you push keke to the other side without being you?
[3:07:45] <sangi53> this is where I would give up and just look it up usually, I admire your patience
[3:07:48] <alrobot2014> baba cannot be keke
[3:07:52] <alrobot2014> baba is immutable
[3:07:57] <vincerocmm> shit
[3:08:06] <+AbnormalVoid> Baba is Defeat and Baba is You
[3:08:07] <silverira> Baba is Keke is You????
[3:08:11] <EuropanLamprey> Baba is You Baba is Defeat
[3:08:15] <sprintmucho> Go rest <plague> your human//animal flaws//shortcomings are increasing at regular intervals. Acknowledge//Submit!
[3:08:18] <vincerocmm> fuck i goit
[3:08:26] <Korgororo> your doing a mediocre job plague - keep it up SeemsGood
[3:08:28] <+AbnormalVoid> only YOU can be defeated, so when Baba is YOU, then Baba is defeated @PlagueOfGripes
[3:08:33] <+MMetas> oh you're right damn
[3:08:35] <warmnoid> you're getting the right idea
[3:08:50] <+Jaysky> Plague do you have a dog in your room?
[3:08:52] <+AbnormalVoid> :thumbs_up:
[3:09:01] <vincerocmm> turn the baba in to kekes on the other side
[3:09:06] <laserbeaming> it's a hard puzzle
[3:09:12] <arkv01> can the grass be moved?
[3:09:12] <EuropanLamprey> The Revive Technique is the solution
[3:09:12] <cap_bon> Only Plague can be defeated no one else
[3:09:14] <+AbnormalVoid> :thumbsup:
[3:09:16] <+AbnormalVoid> damnit
[3:09:24] <+fingalights> @vincerocmm Baba is Baba
[3:09:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> oh man you're gonna be FUCKIN PISSED
[3:09:26] <+AbnormalVoid> could've sworn that's a bttv emote
[3:09:28] <%KevinsLunchbox> if you solve it
[3:09:32] <vincerocmm> right
[3:09:39] <Korgororo> when success is more upsetting than failure LUL
[3:09:44] <vincerocmm> untill its nnot
[3:09:47] <ThirdPersonPhil> but that is why its there
[3:09:54] <%KevinsLunchbox> thats why that wall exists
[3:09:56] <+FadingEmber> oh I just remembered and it WILL definitely make you angry
[3:10:00] <%KevinsLunchbox> to prevent you from doing it the easy way
[3:10:01] <+fingalights> Not isn't in this puzzle
[3:10:18] <locobo98> Game too Hard BaBa is Done Better watch Out BaBa has Gun
[3:10:24] <Dragonfighter46> can you push keke without you to move it to the other side to put you in keke with baba?
[3:10:55] <EuropanLamprey> You have to line up the words and stagger the Baba's in a specific way, Plague will be much upset
[3:11:01] <+FadingEmber> Here is a hint. Keke will need to reach the flag.
[3:11:02] <%KevinsLunchbox> Life continues with or without you
[3:11:13] <+AbnormalVoid> oh shit, I just figured it out lol
[3:11:34] <SpookyBeef7> He got a leg cramp.
[3:11:40] <+AbnormalVoid> it's actually super simple lmao
[3:11:46] <delta278899> baba is pushed through the grass to move in the other side.
[3:11:48] <warmnoid> make the babas push keke's cold corpse
[3:12:12] <Hoanui> I wonder if the hypothetical version of this game made by plague would be easier or not
[3:12:35] <+Jaysky> rawr
[3:13:01] <+Jaysky> You don't need us? BibleThump
[3:13:15] <LunarRemix> Older boyfriend breaks up with you asmr
[3:13:16] <+AbnormalVoid> okay, it's very easy to overthink this, but I'll let you know, the solution is very simple
[3:13:20] <+FadingEmber> Keke is push
[3:13:20] <Korgororo> unga bunga action > puzzle lames
[3:14:25] <EuropanLamprey> Keke needs to cross the grass
[3:14:28] <Dragonfighter46> can you move keke (not the state) to the other side without you?
[3:14:42] <Korgororo> you got this plague SeemsGood
[3:14:49] <+AbnormalVoid> what can Baba be
[3:14:52] <arkv01> my brains smoothing as well
[3:14:53] <HelghastTroop> its not unheard of for plague not having mental energy
[3:15:04] <arkv01> I can feel my neurons merging
[3:15:11] <locobo98> thats a migrane eli
[3:15:27] <Korgororo> how do we feel pain if not with our brain CarlSmile
[3:15:34] <%Samex_Comex> We need thinking food
[3:15:45] <+AbnormalVoid> go oonnnn
[3:15:53] <+AbnormalVoid> oh shit wait
[3:15:56] <+AbnormalVoid> cause baba is baba
[3:16:12] <arkv01> plague if you can't solve this, biden will recover from his dementia
[3:16:16] <locobo98> baba is you
[3:16:19] <+FadingEmber> Keke has to make it to the other side of grass
[3:16:20] <locobo98> BABA IS YOU
[3:16:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> just stop then
[3:16:30] <+AbnormalVoid> baba is you is defeat
[3:16:32] <supersugoisenpai1> This game does that to me too
[3:16:32] <+fingalights> Baba is defeat, so you die Locobo
[3:16:33] <Rodzzila> What level is this?\
[3:16:33] <delta278899> Keke is flag
[3:16:35] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> but baba ...
[3:16:37] <Korgororo> you sound like it dude - maybe take a break
[3:16:39] <+Jaysky> Pass out stream hype
[3:16:48] <arkv01> get some food for reals dude, we'll be here
[3:16:59] <honeyman18> Hooray, brain suffering
[3:17:05] <+fingalights> Skip this one
[3:17:10] <Chatchito> One solution is to push all the words, Babas and Keke to that opening on the right
[3:17:11] <locobo98> BABA IS PUSH
[3:17:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> skipping puzzles is what cowards do
[3:17:16] <Emjit> switching to another level helps
[3:17:16] <+fingalights> I did and I'm a hero
[3:17:17] <ThirdPersonPhil> i tough games were suppose to make us have fun
[3:17:19] <Korgororo> so you'll due on this hill then NotLikeThis
[3:17:23] <locobo98> baba is push so you can move the sheep
[3:17:26] <EuropanLamprey> Stop trying to use Flag is Win, it's not part of the solution
[3:17:34] <Dragonfighter46> keke can cross the grass without you?
[3:17:45] <+ThePayphone> plague is the most liked youtube uploader i know of who I hide from my subscription feed
[3:17:51] <Flamethrowerman09> Why Is You BaBa?
[3:17:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> can yo change the place of babas?
[3:18:15] <missingangle> Anarchy!
[3:18:19] <locobo98> baba is push
[3:18:29] <+Jaysky> Baba is Chaos
[3:18:45] <Korgororo> nice work SeemsGood
[3:18:47] <arkv01> baba is brain is flatenning
[3:18:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> Can you cange the DIRECTION baba's move?
[3:18:55] <EuropanLamprey> Now let me just say the solution in the chat so you can ignore it
[3:19:04] <bevyrage> can baba push grass?
[3:19:30] <laserbeaming> only if grass is push @bevyrage
[3:19:33] <EuropanLamprey> Plague is Angry
[3:19:35] <bevyrage> ah right right
[3:19:44] <gunsrlove> I'm not even on my headphones, and I can hear Eli making strange voices, how much did the game/chat piss him off LUL
[3:19:45] <%KevinsLunchbox> @laserbeaming grass cannot be changed or moved
[3:19:50] <+AbnormalVoid> grass can't be anything, cause it's blocked on it's descriptor accepting sides
[3:19:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Baba is win?
[3:20:00] <+AbnormalVoid> by wall and is defeat
[3:20:04] <Dragonfighter46> can baba pus keke?
[3:20:07] <Korgororo> plague groans Kreygasm
[3:20:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> baba is grass?
[3:20:17] <+fingalights> There are two other stages you can do now i think, I stopped this one and moved on to another.
[3:20:19] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Dragonfighter46 KEKE IS PUSH would need to happen for that to happen
[3:20:27] <+FadingEmber> Reassembly on the other side is required Kappa
[3:20:27] <honeyman18> I just end up staring for minutes blinking at these really.
[3:20:51] <%JJCheeker> Baba can push your buttons
[3:20:54] <+AbnormalVoid> oh shit, I think I got it
[3:21:01] <Emjit> It's one of the most difficult puzzles in the early game so maybe skip it for now
[3:21:09] <gunsrlove> Baba is PUMOHVE Kappa
[3:21:16] <reonome> Plague is PISSED
[3:21:16] <%KevinsLunchbox> I like how abnormalvoid has said that like 5 times during this puzzle alone
[3:21:22] <+AbnormalVoid> LUL right?
[3:21:24] <locobo98> PLAGUE is WIN
[3:21:28] <+AbnormalVoid> this time, I think I do, though
[3:21:43] <+Jaysky> I think he does too
[3:21:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> Can you make a baba move up?
[3:21:45] <MillaMoks> I wonder, can you push the words through he grass? If so, is there enough word blocks on the screen to push something like "baba is" up against the "flag is winn"
[3:21:48] <EuropanLamprey> How many people have the game open in chat?
[3:21:49] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes what happens if BABA is PUSH and MOVE?
[3:21:51] <vincerocmm> so move is win to you?
[3:21:59] <Mister_Teatime> keke is push?
[3:22:06] <EuropanLamprey> Just me?
[3:22:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> can you turn them?
[3:22:39] <+AbnormalVoid> nah, they only turn if you push them
[3:22:40] <locobo98> baba is push
[3:22:45] <locobo98> then push the rabbits over
[3:22:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> Baba is Grass?
[3:22:46] <EuropanLamprey> You only need the words you can manipulate right now to win
[3:22:47] <MillaMoks> oh yea, baba is flag is win should work
[3:22:58] <%KevinsLunchbox> @MillaMoks WRONG
[3:23:05] <MillaMoks> no? oh because of baba is baba, damn
[3:23:09] <%KevinsLunchbox> ye
[3:23:20] <locobo98> this is just coding
[3:23:21] <MillaMoks> what about move is flag?
[3:23:24] <%KevinsLunchbox> no
[3:23:25] <arkv01> plague do you want a noncommittal hint?
[3:23:26] <+AbnormalVoid> many babas for many simultaneous pushes
[3:23:51] <reonome> you can push a bunch of babas over to the right, and then make baba is you
[3:23:59] <Fodderbot> do they move in the direction of the sentence?
[3:24:00] <Mister_Teatime> the trap is overthinking!
[3:24:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> @reonome nope
[3:24:14] <reonome> :(
[3:24:19] <EuropanLamprey> Overthinking is the strongest Baba is you boss
[3:24:28] <arkv01> Baba is Quarantine
[3:24:33] <bevyrage> @Fodderbot nah they move in the direction of their facing, which currently is all three baba horizontal
[3:24:35] <Dragonfighter46> have you tried moving everything to the otherside?
[3:24:39] <+Jaysky> Baba is Cure
[3:24:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> quarantine is you
[3:24:52] <arkv01> Baba ignores social distancing
[3:24:52] <Emjit> Defeat overrides win
[3:24:59] <EuropanLamprey> Baba is Defeat overrides Win
[3:25:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> Keke is win?
[3:25:26] <%KevinsLunchbox> thats not the solution tho so dont worry about it
[3:25:27] <cardboardboots> bits and bobs
[3:25:35] <+AbnormalVoid> baba is pyrrhic victory
[3:25:38] <EuropanLamprey> @Dragonfighter46 No he hasn't and that's the solution
[3:25:41] <+D1ABOL1K> What's a Baba
[3:25:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> ... no you don't
[3:25:54] <reonome> What's a You
[3:26:00] <arkv01> Baba is dad who went out for cigarettes ten years ago :(
[3:26:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> Why don' we use one to push something up
[3:26:11] <+FadingEmber> Can you make BABA push KEKE (your character) ?
[3:26:16] <Emjit> I'd recommend coming back to this puzzle later in the game
[3:26:20] <+AbnormalVoid> only if keke is push
[3:26:21] <laserbeaming> What is a Baba? A misarable little pile of puzzles!
[3:26:23] <warmnoid> FadingEmber yep
[3:26:27] <PGFontana> PLAGUE is TIRED and ANGRY
[3:26:33] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Emjit nah. skipping is cowardly
[3:26:35] <arkv01> yeah this puzzle is a doozy of a fuck
[3:26:41] <+Jaysky> Baba is Lewd
[3:26:51] <+FadingEmber> @warmnoid its called a hint -_-
[3:27:03] <Emjit> @kevinslunchbox I doubt he'll solve it in a reasonable amount of time so
[3:27:04] <delta278899> Baba is flag
[3:27:10] <arkv01> get some food plague, be comfortable
[3:27:15] <PGFontana> baba is pain
[3:27:15] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Emjit thats just the way of the road my friend
[3:27:24] <reonome> I guess you're supposed to use MOVE somehow
[3:27:43] <warmnoid> @FadingEmber sorry i couldn't read the intent underneath your question
[3:27:48] <Emjit> Alright, well its good content watching someone mald over a puzzle
[3:28:20] <+FadingEmber> @warmnoid I'm sorry to that came off more dickish than I intended
[3:28:29] <laserbeaming> does this involve the babas pushing a keke that is not you and then making keke you in the way back?
[3:28:40] <%KevinsLunchbox> @laserbeaming :)
[3:28:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> all 3?
[3:29:00] <Dragonfighter46> can keke be moved by statements?
[3:29:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> only if KEKE IS PUSH
[3:29:21] <laserbeaming> Well, if that's the case I can't figure out how you'd do that
[3:29:39] <EuropanLamprey> @Dragonfighter46 Yes, so long as Keke is Push
[3:29:46] <Mister_Teatime> has he ttried pushing keke over?
[3:29:52] <EuropanLamprey> no
[3:29:57] <luckevalentine> baba can't be flag if baba is baba right?
[3:30:02] <%KevinsLunchbox> right
[3:30:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Why don't you have one move up and down and do baba is flag?
[3:30:10] <%Samex_Comex> Pizza rolls are done
[3:30:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> BABA IS BABA
[3:30:33] <EuropanLamprey> BABA IS BABA BABA CANNOT BE FLAG
[3:30:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> baba is move is push?
[3:30:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:31:15] <arkv01> keke is cheating on baba D:
[3:31:26] <+The_Timo> Was it ever working in the first place?
[3:31:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> baba art thee
[3:31:51] <laserbeaming> At least you are aware your brain is breaking. Well, that might actually make it worse for you.
[3:31:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> or wouild it be thou
[3:31:55] <+AbnormalVoid> baba is baba so no keke
[3:31:58] <alrobot2014> baba is keke don't work
[3:32:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> You is win?
[3:32:10] <+FearEngine> Plague's brain shut down is when the playthroughs get good
[3:32:14] <alrobot2014> keke is baba is the death one
[3:32:15] <Korgororo> plagues brain is squeezing out his ears BibleThump
[3:32:20] <+MrPervSan> Your Gohan analysis video is great @PlagueOfGripes
[3:32:24] <+AbnormalVoid> you is a descriptor
[3:32:28] <+D1ABOL1K> Spaghetti is Reseti
[3:32:31] <+AbnormalVoid> descriptors can't be descriptors
[3:32:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> okay
[3:32:41] <ThirdPersonPhil> yes... things with backdrops seems to be just properties and not objects
[3:32:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> BABA BE MEMES
[3:32:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> Worth a shot
[3:33:02] <arkv01> I enjoy the all the frustrations and jubilations but don't break down, we need you alive for the festival
[3:33:09] <Dragonfighter46> What if keke is you and push and baba is move?
[3:33:19] <Laecerelius> Can you use the IS for two different statements, one going up and down and one going left and right?
[3:33:34] <EuropanLamprey> Painful for you? How do you think we feel?
[3:33:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> @Laecerelius yes but that doesnt matter for this
[3:33:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> worth a shot
[3:34:00] <+mankeyfigh> I had to leave and come back
[3:34:28] <cap_bon> Baba is you secretly stealing brain cells
[3:34:33] <EuropanLamprey> Keke will never reach the flag, that is the power of Baba Requiem
[3:34:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> baba is win
[3:34:41] <theidealheight> These puzzles can, in fact, inflict physical damage on you
[3:34:48] <StonerStan101> So what is the end goal of the game?
[3:34:51] <+AbnormalVoid> baba is bites the dust
[3:34:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> @StonerStan101 win
[3:34:57] <nooogets> I remember beating this level a month ago but now I have no memory of how to beat it
[3:35:01] <+The_Timo> Just keep trying shit as opposed to just talking it through all the time lol. Do you have any other current puzzle options? Go to something else and come back with a fresh mindset later
[3:35:02] <arkv01> but plague why not food?
[3:35:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> FAKE IT UNTIL YOU MAKE IT
[3:35:11] <arkv01> you need brain fuel
[3:35:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> baba is Grass?
[3:35:19] <EuropanLamprey> Keke needs to make it over the grass
[3:35:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> brute force it
[3:35:25] <%KevinsLunchbox> the state of mind plague is in is where I was when I stopped playing during the space levels
[3:35:32] <+AbnormalVoid> well, you have PUSH and MOVE
[3:35:32] <Emjit> That's when you give up and go to a different level
[3:35:56] <+AbnormalVoid> PUSH for repositioning, and MOVE for automated movement
[3:35:59] <+AbnormalVoid> what can be done with that
[3:36:06] <Fodderbot> three baba
[3:36:13] <alrobot2014> but then you are not keke
[3:36:19] <ThirdPersonPhil> You is flag does not work really? i tough there was no such thing as reverse order as long as you link a object to a property
[3:36:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why are still here? just to suffer
[3:36:31] <arkv01> you're kinda on the right track, everything has to happen on the lower half of the screen :)
[3:36:40] <%Samex_Comex> You can do it
[3:36:44] <$jobbedbone> I can feel my baba
[3:36:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> @arkv01 i did it in the top half of the level tho
[3:36:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> no
[3:36:54] <+AbnormalVoid> you can't be flag cause the wall is in the way of the statement being moved over there
[3:37:01] <EuropanLamprey> You can do it on the top half to, you just need three flat spaces
[3:37:13] <warmnoid> @arkv01 you can do it on the top or lower
[3:37:18] <+AbnormalVoid> also, the descriptor needs to be below, or to the right of the noun
[3:37:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> Okay but we need push there first
[3:37:59] <+The_Timo> I think you can
[3:38:01] <EuropanLamprey> I think we can see
[3:38:06] <+The_Timo> By all those exhausted sighs lol
[3:38:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> YOU CAN DO IT
[3:38:10] <arkv01> anxiety man
[3:38:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> WE BELIEVE IN YOU
[3:38:16] <arkv01> you're going into keto
[3:38:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> kill them all plague
[3:38:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> Don't lose your waaay
[3:38:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> Is move push
[3:38:43] <+The_Timo> Lol Jesus christ man it's just a fucking game lol
[3:38:51] <ThirdPersonPhil> just make sure to stop before you die
[3:39:03] <Emjit> Local man dies playing video game
[3:39:03] <Laecerelius> Sounds like you need to eat
[3:39:04] <+Saltyjub> Plague
[3:39:05] <+The_Timo> Lol ffs
[3:39:10] <+Saltyjub> The rock
[3:39:18] <+doc_ock_rokc> you pushed you
[3:39:21] <EuropanLamprey> Keke is Flag
[3:39:21] <+AbnormalVoid> because nothing is YOU
[3:39:23] <alrobot2014> there is not in existence
[3:39:24] <arkv01> you is not connected
[3:39:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> we suffer
[3:39:32] <+AbnormalVoid> How can this beee
[3:39:37] <Hoanui> flag is not you
[3:39:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> it ceases to be
[3:39:45] <EuropanLamprey> Plague has tried everything except the solution
[3:39:48] <theidealheight> That block over there was made to prevent Flag is You
[3:40:04] <coldarmracer> lol
[3:40:06] <+AbnormalVoid> Plague is Defeat LUL
[3:40:07] <arkv01> its okay to hate the game, its not for everyone
[3:40:07] <+D1ABOL1K> mmmm dick nugget
[3:40:08] <warmnoid> LUL
[3:40:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> Get some rest
[3:40:16] <+The_Timo> Because you're bad at it? lol Calm the fuck down haha
[3:40:17] <Emjit> Theres 3 different solutions
[3:40:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Plague is rest
[3:40:18] <cardboardboots> impossible puzzle
[3:40:18] <EuropanLamprey> Remember, Baba is You is "Galaxy Brain Horseshit"
[3:40:27] <theidealheight> The solution was the friends we made along the way
[3:40:31] <coldarmracer> the real solution was the non solution we never got
[3:40:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> baba is win?
[3:40:54] <$jobbedbone> the brain cells we lost along the way BibleThump
[3:40:57] <MillaMoks> can you use the push block in place of the 4th baba?
[3:40:58] <alrobot2014> baba cannot be win because baba is defeat
[3:41:04] <arkv01> 4 babas standing behind one keke on the couch
[3:41:08] <+craftyraichu> Baba is Flag; Flag is Win?
[3:41:10] <+Saltyjub> What if you push over the statements separately? Like not all of them has to go at the same time
[3:41:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> baba is move is keke is flag is win
[3:41:15] <EuropanLamprey> Flag is Win is not part of the solution
[3:41:17] <+FadingEmber> You need to build a boat to bring KEKE across the grass
[3:41:20] <ThirdPersonPhil> Plague is Defeat
[3:41:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Birds... In the sky carry this words for me....
[3:41:33] <Dragonfighter46> i think you dont need to touch flag is win at all
[3:41:49] <EuropanLamprey> You don't need to manipulate or add to it to win
[3:41:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> "Why are we still here just to suffer? Everynight I can feel the Baba I've lost.
[3:41:53] <MillaMoks> wait, does the screen loop like pacman?
[3:42:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> @MillaMoks no
[3:42:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Keke I've lost it's like they all still here
[3:42:17] <+MMetas> Sorry I just got back but Plague can the baba's push keke accross when you arent keke? or do they go through you?
[3:42:18] <MillaMoks> okay
[3:42:19] <Laecerelius> No they bounce at the edges and turn around
[3:42:43] <+craftyraichu> Wait. what is KiKi is Push, but you stagger a rabbit to push Kiki across, while lining up another rabiit to fix KiKi is You?
[3:42:44] <+D1ABOL1K> Bake Bake
[3:43:06] <arkv01> yeah LP tax
[3:43:09] <EuropanLamprey> Baba Speak
[3:43:15] <theidealheight> Double damage
[3:43:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> I've belive it
[3:43:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> we know it, that is the fun part of it
[3:43:25] <+Jaysky> I love Baba speak
[3:43:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> @craftyraichu thats a good idea!
[3:43:27] <alrobot2014> it all comes across as nonsense
[3:43:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> True
[3:43:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> But... IF BABA...
[3:43:29] <+The_Timo> Just move to a different puzzle and come back to it later lol
[3:43:29] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes I hope you are staying safe and health with all the Corona scare going about.
[3:43:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> BUT BABAAA
[3:43:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> IT ceases to be!
[3:43:54] <$jobbedbone> a dark room with 1000 broken AIs screaming at eachother 24/7
[3:44:04] <EuropanLamprey> You can trust me, I literally have the game open in another window on this puzzle right now already solved
[3:44:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> Push against a wall
[3:44:09] <Vaatura> if KeKe is push and BaBa is move, can they touch you without you dying?
[3:44:20] <+The_Timo> try different options!
[3:44:23] <+Saltyjub> Can babas share the same space as a word, and THEN you make the statement "BABA IS PUSH"?
[3:44:47] <arkv01> plague you don't need to solve this to reward yourself with food, food is baba
[3:44:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Flag is Push?
[3:45:00] <+MMetas> see look at the right side bottom wall, you can use that to line the words back up if you make a line of babas, you in the middle and then the line "keke is you" then push keke forward so it's one space ahead
[3:45:03] <vincerocmm> make a cross
[3:45:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> nevermind it won't work
[3:45:14] <TheImmortal70> Damn you Brain, solve the puzzle
[3:45:19] <vincerocmm> throw the is to hell
[3:45:23] <theidealheight> Im trying as hard as i can
[3:45:28] <+MMetas> then keke wont be you until they all align against the right wall? no?
[3:45:29] <EuropanLamprey> I'm trying to help :( you keep ignoring my advice
[3:45:31] <Vladimir_Lemon> Baba PogChamp
[3:45:33] <LunarRemix> Don't cry Plague
[3:45:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Arigato Lamprey San
[3:45:53] <$jobbedbone> have keke pushed across while not you
[3:45:55] <Emjit> Hint: you need to stop being YOU for a while
[3:45:58] <+The_Timo> Which is normal for you apparently lol
[3:46:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> then take a break
[3:46:07] <+AbnormalVoid> use the baba push as a switch statement for descriptors
[3:46:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Then let's talk through monkey noises and shitfliging
[3:46:11] <warmnoid> LUL
[3:46:14] <+Saltyjub> Hey Eli. Babas and words can share the same space, right?
[3:46:14] <bevyrage> plague is rest
[3:46:16] <+AbnormalVoid> or baba move
[3:46:16] <+Jaysky> Brain is Stop is You, Baba is Defeat, Win is Food
[3:46:17] <coldarmracer> plague are you having fun? if not move on.
[3:46:25] <+D1ABOL1K> Baba is Bullshit
[3:46:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> have baba push keke across the grass
[3:46:28] <arkv01> someone said reassembly after pushing it all over? probably the best hint so far
[3:46:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> OOH OHH OOH AH AH *throws shit*
[3:46:37] <+The_Timo> Then fucking stop?
[3:46:46] <arkv01> why ya gotta brute force it this hard BIbleThump
[3:46:48] <+MMetas> break the line that says "Keke is you" so it says "keke is" the babas will push you across witht he words and then on the otherside it will line up again
[3:46:53] <+AbnormalVoid> Plague Honey, it's time for your 4pm Baba Stream
[3:46:56] <+AbnormalVoid> Yes Dear
[3:47:00] <+MMetas> you just need the bottom wall
[3:47:05] <+Reaverund> Sleep stream
[3:47:17] <Vladimir_Lemon> BibleThump
[3:47:18] <+The_Timo> THEN STOP Lol, in what fucking world is this fun for anyone?!
[3:47:23] <+AbnormalVoid> Baba is CBT
[3:47:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> this kind of thing is hard to talk about without diagrams
[3:47:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> oof an worse IQ than koko the gorilla thats bad
[3:47:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fun has nothing to do with it
[3:47:49] <ThirdPersonPhil> they can come back if they hit a wall
[3:47:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> Baba facing the other direction?
[3:47:59] <+The_Timo> If you have one on either side of the word they will
[3:48:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> He is doing for his sayian pride Timo
[3:48:00] <warmnoid> yes
[3:48:02] <+MMetas> down
[3:48:03] <Emjit> Yes
[3:48:05] <+MMetas> yes
[3:48:06] <arkv01> everything on the left side needs to be moved by the rabbits
[3:48:06] <+charlie2089> yes
[3:48:07] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah
[3:48:07] <Mister_Teatime> yes
[3:48:22] <EuropanLamprey> All words and Keke needs to make it to the other side of the grass
[3:48:30] <+MMetas> all of it
[3:48:36] <+MMetas> and you at the same time
[3:48:40] <Dragonfighter46> Can disconnect keke from you and reconnect it on the other side with baba?
[3:48:45] <arkv01> everything, including keke
[3:48:45] <Mister_Teatime> all of it and keke
[3:48:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> OH I GET IT NOW
[3:48:50] <warmnoid> you don't have to move all of it
[3:49:05] <+MMetas> use the rightside wall as a guide
[3:49:07] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you push it against a wall you can disable it and as it squeze it agaisnt the wall it will reenable it
[3:49:11] <Hoanui> all of them, with a stagger, so they line back up on the other side of the grass
[3:49:15] <+ClericOfSparda> keke is flag?
[3:49:16] <Emjit> Hint: The game doesnt end if nothing is You
[3:49:16] <+MMetas> get them all to go into the right side wall
[3:49:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Okay you have to push it all the the right most wall
[3:49:32] <+charlie2089> I rotated it, it was complicated.
[3:49:36] <EuropanLamprey> Everything can be pushed by three Baba's, words can push words
[3:49:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> !uptime
[3:49:37] <@Nightbot> 3 hours 49 minutes 47 seconds
[3:49:40] <+MMetas> plague line up keke is you and the babas
[3:49:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[3:49:47] <arkv01> you're right, give up on the four rabbits line of thought. everything has to be pushed by 3 rabbits
[3:49:54] <+AbnormalVoid> babas move to the other side, then place keke is you into their path after they're across
[3:49:55] <+Jaysky> Tell me about the Baba's George
[3:49:55] <+MMetas> then make the move and run down to YOU in keke is you and move that out
[3:50:05] <Vladimir_Lemon> Come for the Baba; stay for the gripes 4Head
[3:50:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Baba is the devil
[3:50:18] <BestTeaMaker> is plague.exe dead
[3:50:26] <ThirdPersonPhil> 3 babas can push that entire sentence (keke is you) against a wall which will ensure it is lined up even if you disalign it
[3:50:33] <ThirdPersonPhil> so you can temporarely disable it
[3:50:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> okay
[3:50:37] <BestTeaMaker> oh wow that outputted as a link lol
[3:50:40] <+The_Timo> Then fucking look it up
[3:50:42] <%KevinsLunchbox> oh boy. im allowed to talk
[3:50:46] <vincerocmm> seeya later
[3:50:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean have you tried hard enough tho
[3:50:50] <LunarRemix> Have you though?
[3:50:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:50:52] <+D1ABOL1K> Then shit in your dick?
[3:50:52] <+MMetas> You can do it plague I believe!
[3:51:13] <%KevinsLunchbox> also i just resolved the puzzle to refresh me memory of it, its a doozy
[3:51:17] <+MMetas> basically what you wanna do is find a flat spot on the wall
[3:51:18] <Emjit> Hint: stop being YOU temporarily
[3:51:18] <+AbnormalVoid> gotta have it switch back to you from move after keke is across somehow
[3:51:24] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:51:26] <Rodzzila> How precise do you want us to be on the tips?
[3:51:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah man don't look at me I don't know shit about puzzle games I'm only here to shitpost
[3:51:26] <+The_Timo> Just look it up, how is that any different than one of us explaining it to you?
[3:51:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> yeah 9h
[3:51:32] <arkv01> oh god LUL
[3:51:48] <arkv01> oh no BibleThump
[3:51:49] <bevyrage> would the solution become easier to see if you pushed 'keke is you' north one space?
[3:52:03] <+MMetas> no no you have to beb etween them
[3:52:08] <%KevinsLunchbox> k, thats a good start
[3:52:10] <arkv01> you've still got stuff on the right side
[3:52:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> stay in the middle of them and disable you
[3:52:13] <arkv01> *left
[3:52:18] <+charlie2089> I made keke is you is win.
[3:52:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> make them push you with it
[3:52:22] <+AbnormalVoid> nah, not that, the other thing
[3:52:25] <+brightman42> I love this one
[3:52:32] <Dragonfighter46> ignore flag is win
[3:52:34] <+AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[3:52:36] <+techhunter80> keke is flah is win
[3:52:36] <capedbaldie> My favorite "Baba is you" channel
[3:52:43] <EuropanLamprey> I think I'm the only one here with the game open too. You need to have the Baba's push all the words and Keke in such a way that Keke is not you while going over the grass then becomes You once over there. The Baba's need to move every word and Keke at once
[3:52:51] <+MMetas> Almost had it
[3:52:52] <%KevinsLunchbox> @charlie2089 you lying? why you lying?
[3:52:56] <+MMetas> when they move to the back wall
[3:53:02] <+charlie2089> no
[3:53:05] <+MMetas> run down amd move one of the words out
[3:53:07] <+MMetas> yes!
[3:53:07] <Dragonfighter46> kinda
[3:53:08] <+brightman42> big brain time, think several steps ahead
[3:53:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> yes
[3:53:13] <Emjit> @europanlamprey there is multiple solutions though
[3:53:15] <%KevinsLunchbox> no
[3:53:15] <ThirdPersonPhil> Yes... sorry keke int he middle
[3:53:23] <%KevinsLunchbox> KEKE isnt in the middle
[3:53:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> No
[3:53:28] <ThirdPersonPhil> disable the you so keke aint you so you dont die
[3:53:29] <Ipsenscastle> oh i figured it out
[3:53:32] <%KevinsLunchbox> giant cluster of shit. YES
[3:53:32] <+MMetas> no no they will line up when they hit the far right wall
[3:53:41] <+brightman42> there's a few ways to do this but a cluster can work
[3:53:48] <+doc_ock_rokc> Put Player!keke between you and you
[3:53:48] <ThirdPersonPhil> all of it will be pushed against the wall and the sentence will be re aligned
[3:53:48] <Dragonfighter46> like that but diferent
[3:53:51] <+MMetas> What a mysterious game
[3:53:55] <EuropanLamprey> You need two statements pushed over that change once you're over there
[3:53:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> kust keke needs to be inn between
[3:54:00] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes If BABA is PUSH and MOVE you can have them move KEKE over grass
[3:54:03] <+AbnormalVoid> VERY CLOSE
[3:54:09] <%KevinsLunchbox> seriously, if you havent solved this puzzle, quit throwing out your ideas. hes getting closer but you're fucking it up chat
[3:54:12] <+AbnormalVoid> sorta
[3:54:15] <+MMetas> You're on the cusp of success!
[3:54:27] <+AbnormalVoid> baba's need to be used to change descriptors
[3:54:34] <+AbnormalVoid> on keke
[3:54:35] <warmnoid> it's hard to explain this through the chat since you have to be exact on how you set it up and time it
[3:54:47] <Emjit> If you're frustrated by chat not being clear, why dont you just look up the solution?
[3:54:51] <+brightman42> set up automation, cause ego death, wait, be revived, win
[3:54:51] <Chatchito> It's starting to look right
[3:55:01] <+doc_ock_rokc> Baba is move Keke is !player <push you
[3:55:03] <+AbnormalVoid> yeah, it's very timing based, so it's really hard to explain lol
[3:55:12] <Dragonfighter46> no
[3:55:12] <ThirdPersonPhil> Just keke not the text
[3:55:14] <+brightman42> you will touch flag
[3:55:21] <%KevinsLunchbox> KEKE IS YOU is correct, thats a good spot for it as is
[3:55:25] <WhackyChiraqi> has anyone ever licked your bare head?
[3:55:26] <EuropanLamprey> Baba is Move and Keke is Push needs to become Baba is Push and Keke is You once you are over the grass
[3:55:27] <+MMetas> Line of babas move right and left but they cant pull, the words keke is you is only valid when keke and you are lined up. so you have to break keke is you to make it so youc an be pushed accross safely by the line of babas
[3:55:29] <bevyrage> @ThirdPersonPhil keke touching the grass will defeat
[3:55:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> keke ends up on the other side without dying and then keke is you gets fixed in the corner
[3:55:43] <+MMetas> the right wall will line the words keke is you back up
[3:55:44] <Rodzzila> If you want a tip, just look what happened when Baba is Move and Keke is Push is in front of a Baba. If not I can just give you the answer
[3:55:57] <ThirdPersonPhil> @bevyrage keke wont be you during the push
[3:56:02] <Dragonfighter46> you need to move keke to the other side with baba
[3:56:02] <+brightman42> have babas push keke who isn't you, over grass in a way that will end with them also correcting the words so keke is you
[3:56:31] <Vladimir_Lemon> Keke can‚Äôt be Defeated if he isn‚Äôt You. If Keke doesn‚Äôt have You, he can safely cross the grass. Once Keke crosses the grass, he can become You again and take the flag.
[3:56:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> THEY DO IT TO SPITE YOU PLAGUE
[3:56:52] <+MMetas> X X
[3:56:58] <+MMetas> woops
[3:56:58] <+AbnormalVoid> just win
[3:57:00] <Emjit> Just look it up then dude
[3:57:00] <EuropanLamprey> Keke is You can stay on the right side, everything else needs to be to the left
[3:57:01] <+AbnormalVoid> 4Head
[3:57:13] <ThirdPersonPhil> You have to make baba is move and before they get to keke is you, you stand in teh middle and break keke is you horizontally, it will eventually fix it self agaisnt the wall
[3:57:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> Baba is move Keke isn't you when they hit the right wall keke is you
[3:57:29] <+The_Timo> Please just look it up and stop whining
[3:57:33] <WhackyChiraqi> boy this is my first time looking at this game
[3:57:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> and during the push keke wont be you so it wont get defeated on grass
[3:57:36] <WhackyChiraqi> it's very interesting
[3:57:57] <Chatchito> You're trying to move Keke to the other side
[3:58:00] <+The_Timo> I mean sounds harsh but I love watching your stuff on the good days lol, but this is brutal
[3:58:02] <warmnoid> the best i can explain one way to do this is that you line up the "is" in "keke is you" with "flag is win" and have two babas push "keke" and "you" while having the other push keke itself to the flag and timing it so that "keke is you" forms when keke itself is on the flag
[3:58:06] <+MMetas> B K W B W B W
[3:58:10] <+MMetas> crap woops
[3:58:12] <%KevinsLunchbox> tbh I wouldn't stream puzzle games either
[3:58:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> Plague does baba push Non you Keke?
[3:58:15] <+brightman42> have the babas push everything to the right...
