[0:02:29] <+Zerodyne90> KonCha SantaHat
[0:02:42] <Gaagaagi> I hate when I come back to a game and forget all the controls
[0:02:50] <+griff4823> Too early for villain monologues
[0:03:50] <+onlypuppet> It’s not even 5am yet lol, Gmorning! OWL2019rally
[0:04:21] <+griff4823> She said his friend used the dark side
[0:04:41] <+PleasantLee> RAVE TIME
[0:04:52] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[0:05:06] <+Zerodyne90> push/pull them around
[0:05:09] <+silvery_cricket> look at him hovering over that edge
[0:05:14] <+silvery_cricket> that is greast jedi power
[0:05:14] <+Zerodyne90> rgtCreep
[0:05:16] <@dcn2049> classy
[0:05:20] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[0:05:28] <+PleasantLee> they look like puppys too short to jump up on the couch
[0:05:45] <+onlypuppet> This is the first I’m seeing of the new game
[0:05:56] <+griff4823> No wonder it’s so easy to mind trick stormtroopers
[0:06:12] <ziggyjesus> darn you plague, your inconveniant streaming hours are overruled by my need to sleep
[0:06:31] <+silvery_cricket> Why does that droid have a flash light on the back of his head
[0:06:46] <@dcn2049> sounds fine
[0:06:46] <+PleasantLee> pretty good
[0:06:47] <Kurudan> Its fine
[0:06:47] <+Zerodyne90> seems fine
[0:06:53] <LordSDB> sounds good
[0:07:00] <+griff4823> Good
[0:07:15] <+PleasantLee> if I had to nitpick I'd say your voice needs to be a smidge louder
[0:07:36] <+PleasantLee> like a short hair louder
[0:07:46] <+silvery_cricket> I wish there was a Star Wars game where you lose your light saber in the first 5 minutes, so your Jedi runs around with a wooden stick that he beats people to death with.
[0:08:09] <@dcn2049> sounds dumb
[0:08:28] <+onlypuppet> Fantastical
[0:08:37] <Thegreatmopking> sounds like kotor
[0:08:40] <+griff4823> They stay lit unless they get a little wet though
[0:08:49] <St33l_Titan> I wish there was a Star wars game set in the underworld where you play as a young Boba fett early in his career...
[0:09:20] <axivate_> Anyone else read the stream title like the tekken "get ready for the next battle!"?
[0:09:21] <+PleasantLee> I dont have speakers I have a bean can with a string
[0:09:22] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> sounds like a great project that would never get canceled @St33l_Titan
[0:09:28] <+silvery_cricket> Imagine Yoda running around with like a wooden club bapping people on the head
[0:09:37] <axivate_> WOW
[0:09:39] <St33l_Titan> @theoverwhelmingshotgun Kappa
[0:09:45] <@dcn2049> haha what the fuck
[0:09:48] <+onlypuppet> sipsipHellmo
[0:10:37] <+silvery_cricket> OH NO THE HOLE IS 1 INCH TO SMALL
[0:10:43] <cbdg> time stop
[0:10:43] <TheWe4pon> The goat masturbates to the Rat getting cucked
[0:10:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:11:16] <+silvery_cricket> Are Jedi allowed to masturbate
[0:11:22] <Thegreatmopking> even pat could fit through that hole
[0:11:32] <Kurudan> they forgot to add MHW mechanics where you can pus through flimsy vines
[0:11:38] <Kurudan> push*
[0:12:12] <+silvery_cricket> Are the droid's limbs arms or legs?
[0:12:19] <+Zerodyne90> yes
[0:12:27] <+PleasantLee> jedi temple is why
[0:12:32] <Ether101_Prime> Yay. I know the reason.
[0:12:56] <Ether101_Prime> No spoilers.
[0:13:50] <skelfae> trust only in the force
[0:14:36] <+PleasantLee> that robo looks cool
[0:14:46] <skelfae> blue are pull
[0:14:50] <Ether101_Prime> You want to know why?
[0:15:11] <+silvery_cricket> Shouldn't these ancient droids worship this Jedi
[0:15:25] <+onlypuppet> Oh dear
[0:15:35] <skelfae> nah these are the zeffo droids. not jedi
[0:15:38] <Ether101_Prime> The people that built this place where pre-Jedi group.
[0:15:46] <Skeletonmanners> its always great when heavy enemies lose all their weight on death and ragdoll around
[0:15:50] <AnacondaVirtue> Spoilers: These ones are only affected by Force Pull....for some stupid reason
[0:15:53] <+silvery_cricket> shouldnt these droids shit their pants over force users
[0:16:39] <+Kotokaname> climbing hard.
[0:16:56] <+silvery_cricket> Jetpacks
[0:17:21] <+silvery_cricket> THEY ARE SITH VINES
[0:17:32] <Skeletonmanners> plants absorb light :v
[0:17:36] <+Kotokaname> vines are made of ceratanium xd
[0:17:51] <cbdg> so using a lightsaber on a plant will make it grow bigger?
[0:17:54] <Ether101_Prime> Why doesn't Master Sword that bends time and space not work on everything?
[0:17:59] <+silvery_cricket> Is this game just Dark Souls with block puzzles?
[0:18:03] <+askalta> so lightsabers are actually lightmachetes
[0:18:04] <Ryksen> LUL
[0:18:09] <Skeletonmanners> rip that guy
[0:19:02] <+Kotokaname> zoneNugget
[0:19:09] <Ryksen> LUL
[0:19:18] <+silvery_cricket> Is Vine Swinging bad in literally every game
[0:19:28] <ahegotrigger> yes
[0:19:31] <Ether101_Prime> I wish everything wasn't over a damp pit.
[0:19:57] <Ryksen> MrDestructoid bleep bloop
[0:20:14] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[0:20:20] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[0:20:22] <Kurudan> alright rick
[0:20:23] <+silvery_cricket> cuckrat
[0:20:32] <+silvery_cricket> or rat cuck
[0:20:47] <ahegotrigger> newest marvel mcu movie
[0:21:22] <+onlypuppet> My rat’s name is Buffy, she’s a very sweet little lady
[0:21:23] <+silvery_cricket> I want a game where you play a overally flirty jedi, but everyone makes fun of him because all Jedi are virgins supposedly
[0:22:50] <Ether101_Prime> Who knows, maybe they flew in.
[0:23:28] <+silvery_cricket> YURI LOWENTHAL
[0:23:57] <+onlypuppet> Rats can get all kinds of places, but sometimes they can get stuck too
[0:24:00] <+PleasantLee> he used the force to make that trooper vanish
[0:24:15] <+silvery_cricket> rope plague they used rope
[0:24:20] <Schlongalong> maybe they were birthed on that rock too
[0:24:33] <+PleasantLee> are their clothing options to cover the characters head?
[0:24:39] <+PleasantLee> maybe change his voice?
[0:24:52] <+silvery_cricket> He was practicing plague
[0:24:54] <Kurudan> awesome speaker systems
[0:24:57] <ahegotrigger> hes really good at projecting his voice
[0:25:00] <Ether101_Prime> That seems to be a common buge.
[0:25:24] <Lapinelis> Oh neat, which planet is Plague on?
[0:25:52] <DC0118> zeffo
[0:26:06] <+silvery_cricket> KICK HIM IN THE NUTS
[0:26:20] <Kurudan> be careful he has high ground
[0:26:40] <Kurudan> he....abandoned...the high ground..
[0:26:56] <Schlongalong> now you take the high ground
[0:27:04] <DC0118> I just force slow these clowns. fuck it
[0:27:10] <Cyral_Drive> I exploited this guy by making him jump up and down the ledge
[0:27:21] <+Zerodyne90> I always push them over the edge :D
[0:27:25] <jbees7> is this ng+?
[0:27:47] <Ether101_Prime> There is no NG+ yet.
[0:27:53] <+silvery_cricket> Can you use the helicopter lightsaber hilts in this game
[0:28:00] <DC0118> nope
[0:28:33] <ahegotrigger> yes
[0:28:34] <+silvery_cricket> a hallway with turns
[0:28:51] <jbees7> how do you have an Orange saber then?
[0:28:52] <DC0118> you get; single, double, and twin lightsabers
[0:28:53] <Lapinelis> I've found that just being aggressive is the best way to deal with the purge troopers. Just attack them until they attack you, then parry
[0:28:56] <cbdg> it turns into a puzzle because everyone wants to overthink things
[0:29:15] <+silvery_cricket> You sure did it
[0:29:19] <ahegotrigger> he did it
[0:29:22] <Schlongalong> he did it
[0:29:27] <DC0118> he did it
[0:29:31] <Cyral_Drive> he did it
[0:29:52] <DC0118> @plagueofgripes you have to ride it
[0:30:24] <DC0118> @plagueofgripes you got it
[0:31:11] <Ether101_Prime> No only some Jedi do that like Ezra.
[0:31:13] <+silvery_cricket> RAT FIGHT
[0:31:15] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[0:31:29] <ahegotrigger> yeah hes eatin good tonight
[0:31:30] <+silvery_cricket> Can you just run past him
[0:31:37] <+silvery_cricket> like do you actually need to fight him
[0:31:54] <Kurudan> what can you expect from someone who forgot all the jedi basics including mere forc pushing and pulling
[0:32:09] <+StrawHatPat_> Orange is from the pre order right?
[0:32:16] <DC0118> ya
[0:32:21] <ahegotrigger> I like how he forgot puch and pull but remembered za worldo
[0:32:26] <+Zerodyne90> or origin premier
[0:32:37] <+silvery_cricket> He did his signature move
[0:32:39] <+onlypuppet> I got Buffy free when she was small. She had a cough, but she’s doing much better now
[0:33:03] <ahegotrigger> plague the goat racist
[0:33:06] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[0:33:08] <+silvery_cricket> Why does it have a beak
[0:33:20] <+silvery_cricket> does it use the beak to crack nuts
[0:33:36] <DC0118> he eats stormtroopers
[0:33:38] <Skeletonmanners> nah goats would climb that
[0:33:39] <Skeletonmanners> goats are magic
[0:33:46] <lewdnekojam> its like looking in the mirror too real
[0:33:52] <ahegotrigger> he scraped the rocks for minerals with his horrific goat beak
[0:34:21] <+silvery_cricket> Like im really interested in what the space goat's beak does more than the story
[0:34:21] <Ether101_Prime> The Sith flirting is really weird.
[0:34:23] <Kurudan> no
[0:34:27] <ahegotrigger> I meqan you guessed it
[0:34:34] <Kurudan> i remember the clone troopers being badass
[0:34:44] <Kurudan> never storm troopers
[0:34:46] <ahegotrigger> yeah I miss that
[0:34:47] <Lapinelis> Stormtroopers are weaker than a goat here.
[0:34:49] <Skeletonmanners> yea it was generic nazi uniform guys then stormtroopers
[0:34:59] <Skeletonmanners> but stormtroopers were such jobbers it makes sense they made them the default
[0:35:08] <ahegotrigger> stormtropers weaker than spiders and rats here
[0:35:26] <+silvery_cricket> turn off the vent\
[0:35:32] <+Runetoxin> woot
[0:35:33] <+onlypuppet> I don’t know much about Star Wars, but I keep hearing references to it in passing
[0:35:40] <DC0118> most expanded universe sith always talk like supreme fart huffers @plagueofgripes
[0:35:51] <+silvery_cricket> and you broke the puzzle
[0:36:14] <Ether101_Prime> I don't think that's how your supposed to do that.
[0:36:49] <ahegotrigger> it grows so good too
[0:36:51] <Skeletonmanners> plague wanted shenaningans, he got his shenaningans
[0:37:07] <ahegotrigger> he did it so good
[0:37:12] <Skeletonmanners> fwoo woo woo?
[0:37:14] <Skeletonmanners> what was that
[0:37:17] <+silvery_cricket> I like micheal jackson jedi supreme voice
[0:37:24] <Kurudan> cause you killed their rat famlis
[0:37:27] <Kurudan> families*
[0:37:43] <lewdnekojam> amazing work EA
[0:37:48] <+silvery_cricket> ITS THE CUCKRATS
[0:38:09] <ahegotrigger> an entire family of cuckrats
[0:38:17] <Skeletonmanners> no blud
[0:38:21] <lewdnekojam> the hardest enemy in this entire game
[0:38:27] <DC0118> force pushing them off the cliff is kinda fun
[0:38:39] <+onlypuppet> Experience farming?
[0:38:39] <+silvery_cricket> Here come the cuck troopers
[0:38:45] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[0:38:57] <lewdnekojam> lel
[0:39:04] <+silvery_cricket> Ever notice all these storm troopers are dudes
[0:39:16] <lewdnekojam> his manhood?
[0:39:19] <Ether101_Prime> I'm upset that was worked.
[0:39:24] <+Runetoxin> the medichlorians exploded
[0:39:25] <+silvery_cricket> real sausage fest in the empire
[0:39:36] <ahegotrigger> idk someone shot something
[0:39:49] <Ether101_Prime> Grenade. One of them threw a grenade.
[0:39:51] <fusedforms> is the MC supposed to be bad at banter
[0:39:57] <+onlypuppet> OWL2019Mercy dammit
[0:40:03] <lewdnekojam> males are the lemmeings of society
[0:40:27] <Lapinelis> It kinda made sense with the clone wars. Because they were literally one dude cloned over a million times
[0:41:12] <+Zerodyne90> this part took me some time for some reason, the last jump
[0:41:17] <+silvery_cricket> go back outside and walk over the root
[0:41:46] <ahegotrigger> the storm troopers are the same clone army I thought
[0:41:58] <DC0118> if there were female stormtroopers, it would fuck with the escapism because people would get naturally more upset at killing disposables women. bad press etc etc
[0:41:58] <+silvery_cricket> Black Manta
[0:42:03] <lewdnekojam> steve?
[0:42:03] <TehBrickz> Jedi have no souls! Only the blood of the young
[0:42:09] <Skeletonmanners> black manta?
[0:42:16] <ahegotrigger> Black manta
[0:42:17] <Ether101_Prime> Black Man.
[0:42:17] <skelfae> black manta
[0:42:18] <TehBrickz> Black manta ?
[0:42:21] <lewdnekojam> ginger steve?
[0:42:49] <Schuhart> Please don't exit my patrol box, jedi
[0:43:00] <+silvery_cricket> This guy makes sure to drink his blue milk in the morning
[0:43:08] <lewdnekojam> pranked
[0:43:14] <Ether101_Prime> Hahah.
[0:43:22] <TehBrickz> LUL
[0:43:28] <fusedforms> you cannot escape the cuckrats
[0:43:46] <+silvery_cricket> Shouldnt these guys just start running away at some point
[0:43:46] <TehBrickz> " SO i was takin a piss then next thing i knew the piss weas behind me and i was flying! "
[0:44:14] <lewdnekojam> eli the bully
[0:44:24] <TehBrickz> Uhhh...
[0:44:28] <+silvery_cricket> HE WAS A JEDI ALL ALONG
[0:44:33] <InsanityMethods> So did EA rush this game out against Respawn wanting to work on it a bit longer?
[0:44:34] <Ether101_Prime> Force Unleashed 2 had a lot of that stromtrooper banter.
[0:44:35] <TehBrickz> Guess he said fuck this i'm out
[0:45:02] <+silvery_cricket> Go to the root outside
[0:45:11] <Schuhart> He rolled poorly on his Perils of the Warp when he tried to force jump.
[0:45:49] <+onlypuppet> Oh cmon, everyones a bully sometimes
[0:46:04] <Lapinelis> Jedi's pullout game weak
[0:46:21] <Cyral_Drive> @InsanityMethods No doubt they wanted it out in time with the movie
[0:47:04] <+silvery_cricket> No the root where you fought the storm troopers
[0:47:06] <SolidusA> FORCE WILL GUIDE YOU
[0:47:28] <+silvery_cricket> looked like you could run across it
[0:47:38] <DC0118> you can make the jump
[0:47:42] <SolidusA> jump from the top to right
[0:47:51] <Lapinelis> I honestly don't remember this being tricky
[0:47:59] <Lapinelis> but I don't remember what I did here
[0:48:20] <DC0118> @plagueofgripes climb to the very top of the pillar and you'll just barely make the next one
[0:48:24] <Lapinelis> Try jumping from the other side?
[0:48:25] <Ether101_Prime> Has anyone seen the theory about how Satian's nephew is actually her secret son with Obi-wan?
[0:48:47] <SolidusA> next jump took me some trying thou
[0:49:21] <+silvery_cricket> This Jedi looks like he masturbated with the force one to many times
[0:49:44] <+onlypuppet> Figure 8s maybe? Amber said to control the air, but I don’t dance
[0:49:58] <Ether101_Prime> There's a reason for it but it isn't a good one.
[0:50:35] <Ether101_Prime> This wasn't created by the Jedi.
[0:50:44] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:51:09] <Ether101_Prime> The temple is deprecated and falling apart.
[0:51:59] <SolidusA> Well resting re spawns enemies so is not running from it being game
[0:52:05] <+silvery_cricket> They are here to touch your bum and tickle your balls
[0:52:16] <DC0118> the Zeffo made it. They had the force, ita probably a test
[0:52:17] <+tymetak> well it quacks like a dark souls
[0:52:27] <fusedforms> when the Empire sees holes, they fill them with Stormtroopers
[0:52:38] <Lapinelis> You jumped at the wrong bit
[0:52:51] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> This star wars game is still doing the light good dark bad thing
[0:52:52] <lewdnekojam> the jedi are known pranksters. how do you think they earn cridits? by holotube shows ofcourse! press like and subscribe
[0:53:04] <Cyral_Drive> You barely missed it
[0:53:08] <+onlypuppet> I’m here to kill some time before the folks need me
[0:53:25] <Ether101_Prime> It was created by the Zeffo to train their people in Life Wind aka the Force.
[0:54:09] <Ether101_Prime> Force dump.
[0:54:12] <lewdnekojam> your brain wasnt wrinkley enough for their imagination
[0:55:46] <Krimxon> yo! seems like an odd pick for Plague. Wanted something to shit on?
[0:56:00] <+onlypuppet> I’m kind of afraid of purple people too
[0:56:07] <DC0118> FORCE PULL
[0:56:07] <Schuhart> Dropped my lightsaber hot
[0:56:11] <lewdnekojam> oh god that face
[0:56:13] <DehiDehi> not only is the character dumb but he looks dumb too
[0:56:20] <Ether101_Prime> It depends on the style of saber.
[0:56:36] <fusedforms> they should put Wiimote bands on those things
[0:56:40] <Lapinelis> Young cal always looked just wrong to me. Like that's an adults head that got shrunk down
[0:57:00] <+onlypuppet> Maybe it’s just autism?
[0:57:00] <lewdnekojam> work those fingers boomer
[0:57:12] <Schuhart> Aah, the good old Jedi teachings of "this weapon is your life"
[0:57:30] <sasparillatango> he looks like nosferatu
[0:58:07] <+tymetak> thanks force jesus
[0:58:13] <Krimxon> that bit seemed staged as if we weren't supposed to know he could do that
[0:58:23] <Solokaldaka> that's was just force connivance
[0:58:53] <Ether101_Prime> It was wrapped around the branch.
[0:59:26] <DC0118> it's a force unleashed with uncharted gameplay sort of
[1:00:46] <lewdnekojam> thank you for scareing my cat
[1:01:01] <+Zerodyne90> ScaredyCat
[1:01:05] <Krimxon> move faster, hit harder, more hp?
[1:01:13] <Ether101_Prime> That's one of the best moves.
[1:01:25] <Ether101_Prime> Bye.
[1:01:45] <+askalta> it works well in coridors
[1:02:09] <Lapinelis> The pull ability is honestly the best damn thing
[1:02:12] <Krimxon> oh no, did Ether turn up not knowing?
[1:03:11] <KitsuneManami> Can you feel it Plague? Theres a awakening
[1:03:36] <Krimxon> hey look, an inordinate number of stormtroopers wielding melee weapons!
[1:03:52] <+Zerodyne90> the other guy fell down in fear LUL
[1:04:24] <+Zerodyne90> neat
[1:04:27] <KitsuneManami> You just Crushed your hand dude
[1:04:30] <Solokaldaka> force splat
[1:04:53] <Schuhart> Poor Yuri Lowenthal
[1:04:57] <KitsuneManami> Tutorial stupid AI
[1:05:09] <+onlypuppet> Is this sodalite?
[1:05:14] <Sunstalker> vadeAww Plague stream. Hope you're doing well, Eli. Your tweet sounds like you've had a rough year.
[1:05:27] <KitsuneManami> Force Awaken fan?
[1:05:43] <HornetMom> what if that was the point?
[1:05:57] <DC0118> @plagueofgripes cal is like the dweeb padawan of his generation
[1:06:03] <HornetMom> is this dark souls?
[1:06:09] <KitsuneManami> @HornetMom yes
[1:06:17] <Krimxon> it wishes it was Dark Souls
[1:06:25] <HornetMom> huh
[1:06:33] <HornetMom> it was my first time seeing gameplay
[1:06:44] <Krimxon> it sometimes also wishes it was Uncharted
[1:06:53] <KitsuneManami> Feels like you can accidently jump to your death a LOT in this game
[1:07:11] <KitsuneManami> "so fast" LOL
[1:07:29] <KitsuneManami> i cant play this game thanks to the Enemy banter lol
[1:07:32] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[1:07:34] <Samsaz> LuL
[1:07:35] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[1:07:35] <Lapinelis> Pull is just a kill a sub-purge trooper enemy
[1:07:43] <Tubit> the tables have turned, muhahahaa
[1:07:46] <Krimxon> perfect
[1:07:51] <HornetMom> LuL
[1:07:51] <+Zerodyne90> really careful
[1:07:59] <Aydarkzero> he's strong w/ the force monkaS
[1:08:07] <SolidusA> Its strange how Mario 64 nailed 3d movement and games even now struggle
[1:08:15] <InsanityMethods> Have you ever played any of the Legacy of Kain games, Plague?
[1:08:19] <KitsuneManami> dont have the double jump yet?
[1:08:20] <Tubit> calculated
[1:08:41] <DC0118> game broke
[1:08:53] <+onlypuppet> I really liked his recent monster girls, I hope I can talk to some of the real natives from this area to learn some local legends from before the gold rush
[1:09:48] <DC0118> it's too bad enemies dont have limb damage w/ specific dialogue
[1:09:57] <+Zerodyne90> uhm
[1:10:01] <KitsuneManami> go left
[1:10:04] <Aydarkzero> never saw that one
[1:10:07] <Solokaldaka> i think it sad X to push in that droid pull
[1:10:11] <+Zerodyne90> cool
[1:10:49] <KitsuneManami> Can you turn off the moronic dialog? lol
[1:10:51] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:11:08] <Sokumotanaka> force push his ass
[1:11:11] <+Zerodyne90> :D
[1:11:14] <HornetMom> how can he block a lightsaber with a metal handle?
[1:11:21] <Aydarkzero> oof
[1:11:44] <+askalta> H
[1:11:49] <Sokumotanaka> F
[1:11:59] <DC0118> @hornetmom cortosis maybe? I don't know if that's cannon anymore
[1:12:05] <Aydarkzero> @HornetMom something something magic metal
[1:12:22] <HornetMom> oh it's just magic silly me
[1:12:27] <Tiny_Axolotl> who?
[1:12:29] <Cyral_Drive> what did he do?
[1:12:31] <KitsuneManami> Yea they really should have made him silent and CaC
[1:12:48] <Evanwells37> god hates him too. that's why hes a readhead
[1:13:04] <Sokumotanaka> @KitsuneManami Well then they may as well make another kotor game
[1:13:14] <Sokumotanaka> which people did want btw
[1:13:16] <KitsuneManami> Please?
[1:13:53] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka it would need good writers. that was a different era
[1:14:01] <Sokumotanaka> @KitsuneManami We wont be that lucky
[1:14:22] <KitsuneManami> Its the Force PULLING you Ahah.....
[1:14:29] <+askalta> can you like, flick the analog stick the other way when he does it
[1:14:38] <Sokumotanaka> @DC0118 I keep saying just partner up with obsidian and it'll work
[1:15:34] <+onlypuppet> I just got a notification about Disney apparently disturbing the Force, and that’s disappointing
[1:15:55] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka yeah, they could do it
[1:16:21] <Aydarkzero> i don't like that the difficulty changes the parry window
[1:16:47] <Schuhart> Oh yeah, Steve Blum as well
[1:17:16] <fusedforms> "my training will aid me" I fucking hope so
[1:17:23] <Aydarkzero> you did the thing
[1:17:30] <KitsuneManami> wish he'd go "SON OF A BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII" as they fall
[1:18:03] <SolidusA> They trained him bad on purpose as a joke
[1:18:03] <$ATastyPizza> This zone looks nice!
[1:18:14] <KitsuneManami> it's like they took Star Killer and made himc ompletely ass
[1:18:19] <Lapinelis> I'd like to play one of these as like darth sidious or shit. Just forcepush tankers
[1:19:16] <Sokumotanaka> @DC0118 I keep saying the perfect kotor sequel would be obsidian and platinum working on combat and them taking time on character/race customization. All the races from the online game should be available. (Also make another jade empire too)
[1:19:34] <TehBrickz> widepeepoHappy
[1:19:39] <AnacondaVirtue> Plague, it doesn't regenerate at all. You only get Force from hitting enemies
[1:19:39] <KitsuneManami> Arent you like a Padawan?
[1:19:44] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka hard agree
[1:20:17] <Lapinelis> You are a padawan that was stuck as a scrapper 5 years, broken away from the force
[1:20:19] <Skeletonmanners> if i had to guess they prolly made force regen shit on purpose so you get an upgrade to it later
[1:20:49] <+onlypuppet> How important is instinct?
[1:21:00] <KitsuneManami> come on plague hehe
[1:21:13] <Lapinelis> I was stuck on this for a while
[1:21:16] <critfumble_> he's a good storm trooper he's practicing his aim
[1:21:18] <Solokaldaka> whatever they are shooting at they aren't hitting it
[1:21:24] <TehBrickz> they Should be shooting at the wildlife
[1:21:30] <Aydarkzero> Force Ghosts clearly Kappa
[1:21:31] <Sokumotanaka> I just realized. have the cathar appeared in any star wars media besides the kotor games?
[1:22:02] <+onlypuppet> I thought they were given faulty guns
[1:22:13] <Lapinelis> There used to be bush there, that you have since burned off, with that
[1:22:18] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka just the kotor comics, that doesn't really count
[1:22:50] <Sokumotanaka> @DC0118 Hmm makes me wonder if they're in the canon verse then
[1:23:45] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka the rule seems to be nothing is canon until it specifically appears in a disney property
[1:24:36] <Sokumotanaka> I have no idea what that means
[1:24:53] <+onlypuppet> Now I see, thanks!
[1:25:15] <Sokumotanaka> Away
[1:25:43] <critfumble_> force rope
[1:25:47] <critfumble_> intangible
[1:25:50] <DC0118> @sokumotanaka the movies, and clone wars are the only things canon prior to the disney purchase. and then everything disney makes afterwards
[1:25:50] <critfumble_> or something
[1:26:20] <Sokumotanaka> Ah that makes more sense but is also fustrating
[1:26:57] <DC0118> yeah they were brutal and ruthless to the old expanded universe
[1:27:08] <Dkuehn486> i smellllll like beef
[1:27:11] <critfumble_> goats are good at getting into shit they shouldn't be in
[1:27:13] <Dkuehn486> stiiiiiiiiiinkkyyyyy
[1:27:37] <fusedforms> balls worship banned
[1:27:44] <critfumble_> if it was any other animal I'd have the same problem but goats are asshole escape artists
[1:28:26] <Lapinelis> Oh, you're using a different button layout?
[1:28:41] <Lapinelis> I thought pull was RT or something
[1:28:54] <Wynzler> Pull is LT
[1:28:58] <Wynzler> Push is RT
[1:30:25] <Wynzler> Yes, *very* weird
[1:31:09] <+Zerodyne90> HahaShrugMiddle
[1:31:29] <deligador> You need to enable magnet and throw fire ball in it.
[1:31:36] <TheWe4pon> grab candle go to ledge slow it jump then grab ?
[1:31:40] <Lapinelis> This is a stupid puzzle I got stuck at for too long
[1:31:40] <Wynzler> Dont spoil the answer to the puzzle dude
[1:31:42] <Wynzler> Litcherally wtf
[1:31:57] <Lapinelis> Also your button layout is fucking with you
[1:32:08] <Lapinelis> You should be able to pull and push without time stop.
[1:32:52] <$pennykettle_> Imagine being stuck here IRL and your robot made to help you offers to help and you say "no shut up I wanna figure it out"
[1:32:56] <Wynzler> No one said Cal was the most capable force user
[1:33:06] <deligador> You can push thing without time stop.
[1:33:11] <deligador> things*
[1:33:13] <Sunstalker> This is fine. vadeAYA You'll never be as bad at a puzzle as SBF's were in God of War. vadeLUL
[1:33:16] <+onlypuppet> Poor candles
[1:33:36] <+Zerodyne90> seems tricky with face buttons :D
[1:33:54] <$pennykettle_> LUL
[1:33:58] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[1:34:00] <Scrub_of_scrubs> LUL
[1:34:16] <deligador> You can push thing in your hands with same button you pulled it.
[1:34:29] <+Zerodyne90> LUL
[1:34:49] <Wynzler> You *really* don't
[1:34:50] <deligador> NotLikeThis
[1:35:13] <Sunstalker> No, I saw someone else just freezing them in mid air and then jumping across.
[1:35:23] <kipxart> NotLikeThis pogonaWut
[1:35:46] <+Zerodyne90> dont know if this doable with using the face buttons
[1:35:58] <Wynzler> Does he not know you can walk while you have things in your force grip
[1:35:59] <+Zerodyne90> with shoulder buttons you could hold it, aim and then push
[1:36:01] <Lapinelis> It might not be
[1:36:04] <$pennykettle_> bavKEK
[1:36:14] <deligador> Is this some sort of challenge? To use push and freeze instead of pull-push?
[1:36:23] <+onlypuppet> Well, rabbits aren’t really known for their wisdom
[1:36:24] <deligador> Same button.
[1:36:38] <deligador> NotLikeThis
[1:36:39] <+KgKid51> Lol
[1:36:44] <Cyral_Drive> dont freeze just push
[1:36:46] <AnacondaVirtue> You can grab and push something at the same time
[1:37:05] <deligador> Use same button that you used for push.
[1:37:10] <deligador> Pull*
[1:37:11] <kipxart> SwiftRage
[1:37:24] <deligador> No, use pull button when you pulled it
[1:37:27] <Wynzler> Because using the same button for both is impossible
[1:37:34] <Lapinelis> Don't release pull, push while pulling?
[1:37:40] <Cyral_Drive> it will target the branch
[1:38:02] <PirateCanvas> Hey Plague :3
[1:38:12] <kipxart> no push only throw Kappa SwiftRage SwiftRage
[1:38:45] <deligador> I think someone missed hints when he got that pull. Kappa
[1:39:37] <deligador> I think you got bug then, pull-pull worked well for me.
[1:39:37] <+Zerodyne90> the problem is that I think you let go of the pull button in order to push
[1:40:01] <+Zerodyne90> if you would hold LT while pushing with RT it should push where you are aiming
[1:40:18] <Cyral_Drive> you need to get closer or hold and then push yeah
[1:40:26] <+Zerodyne90> yeah :D
[1:41:30] <PirateCanvas> I imagine your pain.
[1:42:00] <deligador> You need to use force, this game only for jedi.
[1:42:06] <Aydarkzero> default b o i s
[1:42:07] <+Zerodyne90> LU
[1:42:23] <Andele1503> this is why all games should be played on kb&m
[1:42:26] <+onlypuppet> I am but a lowly PC MercyMain, and my head is starting to hurt OWL2019punch
[1:42:27] <PirateCanvas> The light saber is the weapon of a Jedi LOL XD
[1:42:33] <Aydarkzero> @Andele1503 gross
[1:42:51] <Wynzler> You can walk with the candle in your hand
[1:42:54] <+Zerodyne90> yay braxtoYay
[1:42:57] <+B_Stevens> Or you can just revert to the default for just this part
[1:44:18] <PirateCanvas> Kinda reminds me of Castlevania Lords of Shadow
[1:44:22] <Andele1503> its exposition dumps
[1:44:24] <+onlypuppet> This is still a very new game, right? Perhaps future patches will help
[1:44:25] <Treuan> I guess the true reward was the friends we made along the way
[1:44:26] <PirateCanvas> the whole switch puzzles
[1:45:01] <PirateCanvas> Why do developers overlook that?
[1:45:06] <$pennykettle_> I hate his face
[1:45:10] <$pennykettle_> baby boy
[1:45:14] <Treuan> His jaw is just crooked enough to make me uncomfortable
[1:45:19] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Cal has such a punchable face
[1:45:24] <deligador> Home alone kid in SW.
[1:45:44] <PirateCanvas> It's 2019 and they still haven't gotten the camera to work properly
[1:45:51] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> I hoped this game would have some balls and allow you to be a gray jedi
[1:45:56] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> He looks like a hairless monkey.
[1:45:59] <Wynzler> Because it has to be all mystical and stupid
[1:46:00] <Treuan> Counter Argument: Rei is just your Jedi Academy character with a different name and face
[1:46:03] <Skeletonmanners> Zeffo really doesnt sound like a race name
[1:46:08] <Skeletonmanners> it sounds like some rando fat guy
[1:46:14] <Skeletonmanners> like Jettster Dexter tier
[1:46:27] <$pennykettle_> Requiem mods are somehow "lovecraftian" to the devs
[1:46:42] <KisaSatoma> shiaLUL
[1:46:46] <$pennykettle_> the devstream yesterday was really disappointing
[1:46:49] <mortelkilll> why doesnt hieroglyph make sense?
[1:46:54] <Andele1503> Warframe lich mods are "idiots port of QTE sequence" to warframe
[1:47:21] <PirateCanvas> SPEAK ENGLISH LOL XD
[1:47:24] <mortelkilll> oh you mean not providing translation?
[1:47:39] <+B_Stevens> Oof is the energy in this channel indicative of what it is right now?
[1:47:47] <+FadingEmber> Did you see the new Railjack stuff they showed off?
[1:47:56] <Wynzler> Padawen
[1:48:01] <Wynzler> Not padawan
[1:48:02] <mortelkilll> i just expect that other civilisations wouldnt just use letter replacement
[1:48:20] <Cyral_Drive> she needed it raised so they could reach it via their wallrunning platforms
[1:48:35] <mortelkilll> some current scociety dont write wit hthe roman alphabet
[1:48:45] <PirateCanvas> I didn't know you were playing Tomb Raider the Last Jedi
[1:48:48] <+onlypuppet> Did they skimp on love?
[1:49:02] <mortelkilll> not providing translation is pretty dumb trough il lagree
[1:49:14] <CrmznOgre> How far are you in the game and how has it been so far?
[1:49:15] <Skeletonmanners> this game is both better and worse than i expected
[1:49:52] <mortelkilll> we could just bomb the writing
[1:49:58] <+onlypuppet> I’m so confused
[1:50:07] <$Valdorick> No no, that was the C-team, they were just lost.
[1:50:09] <+B_Stevens> Oh my bad . I'm an idiot it's literally called a plague of gripes
[1:50:13] <deligador> I would like to hack someone.
[1:50:36] <Sunstalker> Hieroglyphs are only good if they're purely visual. Like the precursor markings in Jak and Daxter vadeHeart
[1:50:45] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:51:09] <+onlypuppet> OWL2019200iq OWL2019Sombra OWL2019gg ... scary
[1:51:13] <PirateCanvas> But Plague it's a masterpiece of a game - Star Wars Fanboy
[1:51:50] <mortelkilll> can you guys explain whats the issue with hieroglyph? is it just the lack of translation?
[1:52:22] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> That run looks so weird.
[1:52:41] <PirateCanvas> Hieroglyphs try to make it seem ancient and mysterious but it's such a cliche now
[1:52:44] <deligador> You will lose many plain ponchos.
[1:52:48] <mortelkilll> ok so overused
[1:53:02] <mortelkilll> i tought it was just to show non roman languages
[1:53:10] <+onlypuppet> There doesn’t seem to be a translation key, maybe they don’t mean anything
[1:53:10] <$pennykettle_> @mortelkilll because talking with pictures is shitty. if a civ can build crazy shit and travel across space, they will have a better language than the language equivelant of a child's comic book
[1:53:24] <mortelkilll> you do realize japan exist?
[1:53:45] <mortelkilll> or yo umean litteraly talkign with pictures
[1:53:51] <+silvery_cricket> Klingons would hate Star Wars
[1:53:53] <mortelkilll> did egypt actually do that?
[1:54:14] <$pennykettle_> I'm not familiar with japanese writing but I assume its more complicated than heiroglyphs
[1:54:34] <mortelkilll> japanese writing is basiquelly small words and syllables
[1:55:05] <PirateCanvas> Most Egyptians speak Modern Standard Arabic
[1:55:08] <deligador> OwO
[1:55:16] <+silvery_cricket> im talking about what media Klingons would hate, and I think they would hate Star Wars
[1:55:19] <mortelkilll> sure
[1:55:31] <+onlypuppet> I have a hard enough time memorizing Spanish grammar sipsipGears
[1:55:36] <mortelkilll> just meant that im not sure ancient egypt language was as simplistic as you say it was
[1:55:55] <mortelkilll> but i agree that a language would need to have a lot of nuance and not just be pictures
[1:55:58] <PirateCanvas> I like how he runs with the light saber
[1:56:24] <mortelkilll> but alphabet not the only way to make an advanced language
[1:56:28] <Andele1503> Kanji (and the other 2 katakana and the gana thingymajig) are MUCH MUCH quicker to write down than egyptian hieroglyphics were and express more
[1:56:30] <PirateCanvas> He runs like a kid with light saber toy
[1:56:38] <+Phoenixianstyle> "hit him already!"... "yeah I got him" lol at least he's his own cheerleader
[1:56:42] <$pennykettle_> Are there and amputee jedi with lightsabers for legs
[1:56:59] <deligador> PogChamp
[1:57:00] <mortelkilll> dont think lightsabers legs would work
[1:57:17] <Andele1503> issue with japan (and much more with china till numerous standardization attempts) were the regional accents/phrases
[1:57:19] <PirateCanvas> It froze
[1:57:31] <mortelkilll> make sense
[1:57:32] <deligador> LUL
[1:57:34] <$pennykettle_> LUL
[1:57:35] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[1:57:41] <ZetsubouxSensei> gottem
[1:58:06] <$pennykettle_> I'm sure some languages are far more optimal than others
[1:58:43] <PirateCanvas> It's the Merch from RE 4
[1:58:52] <deligador> Bounty hunter i think.
[1:59:53] <deligador> gottem [2]
[2:00:00] <$pennykettle_> So you had to lose?
[2:00:11] <Aydarkzero> the plot demands it
[2:00:12] <ZetsubouxSensei> wow that was really forced
[2:00:17] <deligador> You can't win in this fight actually.
[2:00:41] <mortelkilll> checked a bit and cuneiform/hieroglyph see mt ohave started simple and gradually became closer to using simbols to represent sounds
[2:01:28] <mortelkilll> the hieroglyphs that most people see are the really old one
[2:02:38] <Aydarkzero> a slab of metal
[2:03:43] <$pennykettle_> Interesting tech they have here where wires will stretch across the room
[2:04:09] <mortelkilll> really convoluted way to lock a door
[2:04:16] <+Phoenixianstyle> soooo this guy's an electrician right? lol
[2:04:34] <Cyral_Drive> he was a scrapper
[2:04:45] <$pennykettle_> LOL
[2:04:58] <+onlypuppet> Year of the Boar?
[2:05:09] <mortelkilll> most fantasy and sci fi dont realise beign huge isnt a good thing, you need way mroe food
[2:05:31] <mortelkilll> also breeding is way harder
[2:05:39] <mortelkilll> they would alway be underpopulated
[2:08:43] <+Phoenixianstyle> RPGAyaya that droid is so cute!! RPGAyaya
[2:09:12] <+silvery_cricket> flavor
[2:11:08] <mortelkilll> oh sweet an arena
[2:11:19] <jiin6> Farewell plate
[2:11:21] <ovan20> your plate isn't allowed here sir! rooCop
[2:11:25] <Sunstalker> vadeAYA This soundtrack
[2:11:33] <$Valdorick> Man, even our games have tournement arcs now?
[2:11:53] <+onlypuppet> It’s been awhile
[2:12:34] <jiin6> Shounen tournament arcs can be a series death sentence
[2:12:43] <mortelkilll> so where they waiting for us to escape?
[2:13:02] <$pennykettle_> They wanted you to escape and plug puzzles in?
[2:13:04] <+Ikari_Sunshine> what is this music
[2:13:20] <Ipsenscastle> this is some prequel-ass shit
[2:13:21] <mortelkilll> probably a rancor
[2:13:36] <jiin6> "we were expecting a jedi in this tournament arc
[2:13:40] <mortelkilll> i like colliseum, they have ambiance
[2:14:10] <mortelkilll> but yeah its funny how forced this is
[2:14:32] <mortelkilll> fun music
[2:14:33] <Impeachedpear3> Hello Plague, how're you doing this morning?
[2:15:01] <+onlypuppet> Aww they’re cute
[2:15:39] <Ariddic> some infighting, or anything between them would be cool
[2:15:39] <jiin6> Aw no infighting?
[2:15:40] <ZetsubouxSensei> i like how the spider looks :)
[2:15:40] <Ariddic> but nah
[2:15:53] <morkelebmink> the thing that irritates me in dark souls games is . . . why don't the differentt enemies and mosnters ONLY attack you, why don't they kill each other?
[2:16:05] <mortelkilll> because gameplay
[2:16:22] <Cyral_Drive> @morkelebmink they do sometimes
[2:16:37] <mortelkilll> infighting ennemeis are really easy to exploit
[2:17:08] <jiin6> A kiwi
[2:17:23] <Ipsenscastle> @morkelebmink at least BB addressed that
[2:17:38] <jiin6> Escape
[2:17:39] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Why?
[2:17:49] <mortelkilll> daww its already over
[2:17:50] <Andele1503> @morkelebmink In DS1 and BB they actually did do that often enough. Weird how its a thing in the good from games but not the rest
[2:17:53] <$pennykettle_> that happened I guess
[2:18:00] <jiin6> See ya tournament arc
[2:18:01] <+Razputin217> SHOCKER
[2:18:02] <Daxalog> ok
[2:18:08] <ovan20> is this DLC?
[2:18:29] <ZetsubouxSensei> they get away scot free?
[2:18:29] <+CursedNobleman> yuyu hakusho had the best tournament arcs LUL
[2:18:45] <+onlypuppet> Maybe it was filmed
[2:18:45] <ovan20> @CursedNobleman Toguro rooGasm
[2:18:59] <ClaymoreJesus> Cere is just constantly monkaS
[2:19:11] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> god, her eyes
[2:19:19] <+theman515> but drama Plague, gotta have drama
[2:19:29] <mortelkilll> i only care about murder
[2:19:32] <ovan20> the bug eyes lady scared me rooBooli
[2:19:33] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> But what about the Wookie planet?
[2:19:48] <InsanityMethods> Pug eyes is back
[2:19:48] <mortelkilll> doing things can be fun sometime
[2:20:01] <jiin6> No one should care about the wookies
[2:20:02] <+CursedNobleman> @ovan20 the mermaid girl referee was my teen crush, and probably explains my love of monstergirls LUL
[2:20:02] <Cyral_Drive> find ancient thing, find another ancient thing
[2:20:12] <mortelkilll> i like his cheek hair
[2:20:26] <+CursedNobleman> mutton chops sir
[2:20:37] <mortelkilll> those are epic chops
[2:20:54] <+CursedNobleman> hiccupburp? LUL
[2:20:58] <+onlypuppet> Errand boi Ginger lad?
[2:21:01] <+theman515> I'm honestly most let down that that character isn't voiced by Danny Devito
[2:21:18] <+Phoenixianstyle> waitasecond... did this fuck sell him out to the bounty hunter?
[2:21:48] <mortelkilll> yeah that was really dumb
[2:21:54] <Daxalog> Dude the force
[2:21:59] <Daxalog> lmao
[2:22:03] <mortelkilll> they l;itteraly were waiting for you to escape
[2:22:20] <+theman515> The way I heard it put is that this is the best Star Wars game to come out in a decade and that's the most depressing part
[2:22:24] <Cyral_Drive> that felt like a deluxe edition side mission that they shoved in
[2:22:25] <jiin6> Its simple, but also dumb
[2:22:33] <Ipsenscastle> the story is clearly an afterthought when it should've been top priority
[2:23:23] <kipxart> sounds like a Disney movie
[2:23:39] <mortelkilll> were following the game design, not the story
[2:23:40] <jiin6> "lets make uncharted, but with star wars"
[2:23:48] <InsanityMethods> Sounds like he suffers from "most SW protags at the moment"
[2:23:49] <mortelkilll> its kind of like bloodborne, i go places but i have no idea why
[2:23:54] <AnacondaVirtue> You're trying to find the holocron with the list of Force-Sensitive children
[2:24:09] <+onlypuppet> Just along for the ride, pick your motivation
[2:24:24] <+Phoenixianstyle> maybe they're trying to say because he has nothing to give him a reason, he doesn't need a reason to help out with his "new life" lol
[2:24:50] <mortelkilll> this is more a series of level than a story
[2:25:29] <jiin6> Chris hansom wants that Zeffo fella to take a seat
[2:25:35] <mortelkilll> ive seen games do that kind of thing way better
[2:25:37] <SinnerBeta> I'm here to hear Plague complain about Star Wars, did I make it in time?
[2:25:39] <+CursedNobleman> all these fancy space metals and COPPER LUL
[2:25:48] <mortelkilll> yup, still plenty of complaining to see
[2:26:21] <mortelkilll> at least they didnt randomly rename copper to make it soudn fancier
[2:26:26] <mortelkilll> warframe does that a lot
[2:26:37] <mortelkilll> copperium
[2:26:43] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:26:57] <SinnerBeta> good, good, let the hate flow through him. or rather annoyance and gripes over annoying petty details
[2:27:14] <mortelkilll> plague is falling into the dark side of the gripes
[2:27:21] <jiin6> Fixed there elevators
[2:27:36] <+onlypuppet> Cisco gave me some copper yesterday, I want to make a necklace pendant with the sodalite
[2:28:06] <jiin6> The empire attack on the wookies tho
[2:28:10] <Lapinelis> He knows where it is. He said the destination going out.
[2:28:13] <mortelkilll> could be on tatooine
[2:28:21] <mortelkilll> could be in darth sidius ass
[2:28:27] <InsanityMethods> It's all on Dantooine
[2:28:48] <+CursedNobleman> nar shadda is the best planet. fight me LUL
[2:28:52] <mortelkilll> darth sidius is such a huge asshole, you ll never find it
[2:29:28] <mortelkilll> and we hate ourselves
[2:29:36] <InsanityMethods> And ugly
[2:29:53] <jiin6> She got them shojo eyes
[2:30:15] <mortelkilll> horrid goblin man representation Kappa
[2:30:24] <Lapinelis> Doesn't help that Cal is a shit too
[2:30:37] <InsanityMethods> I'd be afraid to surprise her out of fear of her eyes falling out of their sockets.
[2:30:46] <+onlypuppet> OWL2019Ana
[2:30:51] <jiin6> 2d Disney character
[2:31:06] <Daxalog> Shes non-barbaric
[2:31:10] <ittla> jedi jedi force empire jedi lightsaber
[2:31:16] <@Nightbot> @Schuhart -> Back to square one. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:31:25] <Ipsenscastle> so much of new star wars has exactly this problem
[2:31:28] <mortelkilll> at least we have horrid to describe him
[2:31:33] <Daxalog> Shes no-nonsense I assume
[2:31:53] <mortelkilll> rather a heart of pyrite
[2:31:57] <+CursedNobleman> What does the space black lady. LOOK LIKE?
[2:32:00] <Lapinelis> Describe Cal now.
[2:32:14] <+onlypuppet> Lil Cal?
[2:32:27] <jiin6> And cal's actor played the joker that one time
[2:32:40] <SirMcSlushy> Looks like a hotdog
[2:32:44] <InsanityMethods> Not-Joker
[2:32:54] <+onlypuppet> Ouch my head
[2:33:05] <mortelkilll> man these wookies are horrifying
[2:33:10] <jiin6> Horrible ginger joker
[2:33:11] <Lapinelis> Why does everything here have to have three Ys
[2:33:14] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[2:33:19] <$pennykettle_> oh lord
[2:33:40] <ZetsubouxSensei> arent wookies suppose to be bigger?
[2:33:42] <mortelkilll> battlefront?
[2:33:47] <Mister_McDerp> battlefront 2
[2:33:48] <Cyral_Drive> battlefront
[2:34:12] <mortelkilll> wookies are supposed to look adorable not horrifying
[2:34:22] <mortelkilll> by ea too
[2:34:29] <Mister_McDerp> both are made by dice
[2:34:36] <lennyrager> Sup yall
[2:34:37] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[2:34:44] <Ipsenscastle> The problem is that every time I try and point out how badly written the new characters are, people argue back that I 'just don't like them because they're a woman/whatever' which is so awful and missing the point. The casting is fine, they deserve better material, but it's not going to happen while people keep going to bat for trash all the time
[2:34:46] <jiin6> Galatic Battlefield?
[2:35:20] <ittla> the star wars in this game is very disney-brand star wars
[2:35:21] <DC0118> @ipsenscastle preach
[2:35:23] <Jdrockefeller> I probably couldn't tell you what's popular on tv these days
[2:35:24] <mortelkilll> i ofte nmake the point that rey could have been a good character, she just isnt
[2:35:30] <mortelkilll> same with the others
[2:35:35] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[2:35:37] <mortelkilll> they have good basis but not developpement
[2:35:39] <SirMcSlushy> GG
[2:35:41] <Samsaz> LuL LuL
[2:35:41] <SirMcSlushy> >3>
[2:36:14] <Ipsenscastle> @mortelkilll yup
[2:36:41] <AnacondaVirtue> They're hired by the Emperor, not that guy
[2:36:50] <AnacondaVirtue> Empire*
[2:37:03] <ZetsubouxSensei> is combat in this game always so abysmal?
[2:37:22] <Samsaz> Ramslug Kreygasm
[2:37:25] <+onlypuppet> Baby!!
[2:37:28] <jiin6> Yes
[2:37:34] <Mister_McDerp> its the perfect animal
[2:37:39] <Aydarkzero> it banged the slugs monkaS
[2:37:40] <SirMcSlushy> Can you look at it in some kind of beastiary menu?
[2:37:57] <Aydarkzero> yeah it has that
[2:38:34] <ZetsubouxSensei> i need to see the justification of a ram-slug if it has one
[2:38:59] <ittla> this game seems to focus on a whole lot of the unnecessary details of star wars world building but without actually doing anything interesting with them like a kotor game
[2:39:32] <Ipsenscastle> OG poncho is the best one, it's stupid
[2:39:40] <Cowctus> man, the more realistic games look, the more awkward character customization screens are
[2:40:08] <Ipsenscastle> There needs to be a Man With No Name poncho
[2:40:50] <lennyrager> Too on the nose
[2:41:13] <Aydarkzero> least it isn't Frost
[2:41:23] <Ipsenscastle> 'Thanks videogame' is the 'OK Boomer' of bad game design
[2:41:33] <ittla> it's almost as if this is a bit of a rushed title that is outside of respawn's expertise
[2:41:37] <lennyrager> Bad optimization
[2:43:00] <ittla> murder the wildlife like a real Jedi :tm:
[2:44:20] <ittla> i'm getting flashbacks to the tarzan world of kingdom hearts 1
[2:44:44] <+onlypuppet> I find a lot of things endearing in their own way
[2:45:08] <Ipsenscastle> The one thing I've really liked about the new Star Warses is Old Luke, he had drama and an interesting arc, and actually did some new things within the setting that still felt very Star Warsy.
[2:45:43] <ZetsubouxSensei> oh wow
[2:45:44] <SirMcSlushy> lol
[2:45:46] <Mister_McDerp> LUL
[2:45:46] <ittla> nice
[2:45:48] <lennyrager> Ty ipsen
[2:45:51] <Ipsenscastle> uhhh
[2:46:00] <ZetsubouxSensei> watch it softlock
[2:46:10] <jiin6> He's fine
[2:46:37] <SirMcSlushy> What a magic trick
[2:46:37] <+onlypuppet> Oh
[2:46:38] <Ipsenscastle> problem solveddd

[2:48:19] <Ipsenscastle> Meaningless Resistance should've been the title of Last Jedi
[2:48:30] <InsanityMethods> oof
[2:48:35] <SirMcSlushy> Imagine if BD was the baby from death stranding
[2:48:51] <malickaistorm> Can you choose to be dark or light?
[2:48:52] <Cyral_Drive> They didn't bother with that at all
[2:49:16] <Daxalog> +5 points. Game has Infighting
[2:49:40] <ittla> either respawn isnt fit for this kind of game or they just phoned it in because EA told them to make a star wars game
[2:49:49] <Ipsenscastle> It kind of reminds me of PS1 platformers like Crash Bandicoot, where you can see the obstacles waiting for you in the distance, existing just to be bopped
[2:50:06] <Mister_McDerp> the empire hates slugs
[2:50:18] <+CarlosEoM> what a champ
[2:50:25] <SirMcSlushy> He tried to rocket jump
[2:50:28] <+Punishedkaiger> He wanted to rocket jump
[2:50:45] <lennyrager> Damn Florida man
[2:50:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:51:16] <ittla> as a florida man i can confirm this is florida
[2:51:16] <Holycow8498> Hello
[2:51:37] <Holycow8498> Do you have the duel bladed lightsaber?
[2:51:44] <+onlypuppet> Take care in rezzing
[2:51:48] <%Samex_Comex> Good morning
[2:52:00] <malickaistorm> henlo sam
[2:52:26] <SirMcSlushy> Tiz the ron weesely of star wars.
[2:52:42] <Holycow8498> So how have you been feeling about the game
[2:52:59] <InsanityMethods> Ron was better though.
[2:53:16] <malickaistorm> I'd like to see plague play death stranding if he was into it and talk about a pile of rocks or bricks like he did in his dark souls playthrough
[2:53:31] <$pennykettle_> the tone feels like a 2010 tie in game
[2:53:42] <Ipsenscastle> I'd love getting to play as an alien for once. Even a Twi'lek would do, although I'd prefer something insane like a Rodian or that tiny bat alien from the cantina
[2:53:47] <ittla> it would suck if respawn got pigeon holed into doing star wars
[2:53:48] <SirMcSlushy> Gotten me all nostalgic about demon souls now
[2:54:10] <InsanityMethods> I feel like Respawn were a little rushed to be honest.
[2:54:39] <Daxalog> Can you spec for force regen?
[2:54:51] <+silvery_cricket> and i thought
[2:54:54] <+silvery_cricket> it
[2:54:57] <+silvery_cricket> smelled bad
[2:54:57] <+onlypuppet> Honey?
[2:55:00] <+silvery_cricket> on the outside
[2:55:33] <%Samex_Comex> Ew
[2:55:34] <SirMcSlushy> Holy shit those things can stretch
[2:56:11] <SirMcSlushy> "This whole forest wants maaah diiiick"
[2:56:24] <Zalthin> vore forest
[2:56:26] <Holycow8498> Saw is a dick
[2:56:30] <Ipsenscastle> they're aiming suspiciously low
[2:56:33] <SirMcSlushy> God that is funny though watching that thing stretch out
[2:56:34] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no not the Wookies again
[2:56:37] <InsanityMethods> This whole force echo power seems kind of like an excuse for Rey's powers tbh.
[2:57:28] <Holycow8498> Cal has the same ability as Quin Lin Vos
[2:57:44] <ChrisM341> Hello everyone
[2:57:50] <Ipsenscastle> The only Star Wars thing since the 90s that made me genuinely interested in the characters was the book Lost Stars, it was really excellent
[2:57:57] <kipxart> thats a mod idea
[2:58:13] <mortelkilll> to be fair, the original characters wouldnt have been nearly as good if it wasnt for the actors
[2:58:13] <Schuhart> Haha, but that would be nasty, haha. Who'd want that. hahaha
[2:58:20] <Holycow8498> I think they are dead
[2:58:21] <ZetsubouxSensei> it'd make this game intersting at least
[2:58:26] <SirMcSlushy> I think they killed them
[2:58:27] <$pennykettle_> I really wish you could hide shit like that without the ESRB rating giving it away. It would catch attention for a star wars game to be labelled containing violent sexual encounters
[2:58:27] <mortelkilll> new actors arent bad but they arent really going beyond script
[2:58:30] <Daxalog> They alll got used up aready
[2:58:36] <%Samex_Comex> While whimsical star wars music plays
[2:58:48] <SirMcSlushy> Top tier gameplay
[2:59:06] <Daxalog> It did like 40% of his hp
[2:59:09] <Ipsenscastle> niceee
[2:59:14] <ittla> this game has that modern star wars problem of having details in place of character
[2:59:30] <Ipsenscastle> @ittla that's a good way of putting it
[2:59:53] <SirMcSlushy> I want that booooty
[3:00:00] <Daxalog> Do you think they share when the suck? Just a thought
[3:00:04] <InsanityMethods> Style over substance you mean?
[3:00:33] <SirMcSlushy> The symbiote of the goatslug and the really uncomfortably big spider.
[3:00:36] <%Samex_Comex> A slug goat?
[3:00:39] <Daxalog> The Beasts have formed a truce
[3:00:44] <+ZalgoTheWickedGod> Is that a fuckin goat slug?
[3:00:48] <+onlypuppet> Oh my goodness
[3:01:24] <Sunstalker> Warframe raknoids?
[3:01:25] <Holycow8498> It seems this game has the opposite problem of the force unleashed
[3:01:27] <SirMcSlushy> Its eyes are on its horns
[3:01:31] <Lapinelis> The force powers are for stoping an enemy from attacking
[3:01:34] <Daxalog> Thstd s a cute spider
[3:01:36] <Lapinelis> Not an actual attack
[3:01:54] <+Super_General_Guy> You don't have enough midichlorians to use the good powers
[3:01:59] <SirMcSlushy> You wanna lightning people
[3:02:07] <Aydarkzero> of course
[3:02:09] <+silvery_cricket> I cant wait
[3:02:09] <Ipsenscastle> They're sensory hairs so you can detect Flowers trying to grab your goodies
[3:02:15] <SirMcSlushy> Why hasn't anyone made a lightrifle yet-
[3:02:17] <+onlypuppet> Spiders are good for pest control
[3:02:23] <+silvery_cricket> I hope palpatine is like Roshi
[3:02:23] <Betofall> hate that hes back
[3:02:41] <ChrisM341> What if this game was KOTOR?
[3:02:47] <InsanityMethods> Plague has anyone requested you guest on EFAP by any chance?
[3:02:55] <Ipsenscastle> the prophecy was always shit writing
[3:03:04] <mortelkilll> i like the idea that bot hjedi and sith needed to die
[3:03:10] <ittla> but then they had to bring back the empire vs rebellion because starwars is creatively bankrupt
[3:03:23] <Jdrockefeller> remember that Vader is evil jesus
[3:03:34] <Ipsenscastle> but I think the prophecy maybe referred to the purge of the Jedi?
[3:03:38] <Jdrockefeller> no daddy but just born anyway
[3:03:51] <+onlypuppet> Wait he’s actually evil?
[3:03:52] <ittla> star wars just needs to be a fantasy adventure in space
[3:03:52] <MarylandJutsu> yeah Grey Jedi are the normal people with Force
[3:04:00] <Betofall> he got better
[3:04:04] <+silvery_cricket> Palpatine has been coming back for decades
[3:04:22] <+Super_General_Guy> Sidious made a Force cocoon and slept for several years in space I guess
[3:04:23] <Holycow8498> Maybe its one of the Palpatine clones from the old EU
[3:04:23] <lennyrager> He could be a ghost
[3:04:27] <Lapinelis> The only thing vader did was nearly kill out the "light"
[3:04:29] <MarylandJutsu> Ben?
[3:04:32] <InsanityMethods> Kylo gets yeeted off a cliff and dies.
[3:04:32] <MarylandJutsu> Kylo
[3:04:33] <Jdrockefeller> obviously sidius can fly like in the final boss in those SNES star wars games
[3:04:34] <Holycow8498> Not Jacen Solo
[3:04:35] <ittla> ben swolo
[3:04:37] <ChrisM341> V
[3:04:41] <InsanityMethods> It's all Rey.
[3:04:43] <ZetsubouxSensei> nice float
[3:04:43] <InsanityMethods> Kylo
[3:04:44] <JonseyMcDanes> we talkin fan fics bitterSip
[3:04:45] <Holycow8498> Kylo Ren
[3:04:54] <+onlypuppet> The dude in the report
[3:04:57] <Ipsenscastle> I always thought it was a dramatic irony thing where 'bringing balance' meant destroying the overwhelming Jedi institution
[3:05:00] <AnacondaVirtue> Kylo Ren
[3:05:11] <SirMcSlushy> Look at the goatslug's horns closely
[3:05:15] <MarylandJutsu> Also your thoughts on the new robot boy?
[3:05:17] <InsanityMethods> Have you read the leaks, Plague?
[3:05:23] <MarylandJutsu> I mean Luke was pretty bland tbh
[3:05:26] <JonseyMcDanes> Guy-lo Ben
[3:05:30] <mortelkilll> in 4 luke was bland
[3:05:34] <mortelkilll> he got better in 5
[3:05:37] <Betofall> jedi can't count unfortunately
[3:05:37] <MarylandJutsu> yeah
[3:05:39] <%Samex_Comex> Why can't you ride the goat slug
[3:05:52] <Ipsenscastle> Rey could've been good if they maintained the Scavenger aspect and skills beyond her intro
[3:05:52] <+silvery_cricket> I love Kylo
[3:05:52] <ittla> luke was your hero's journey good boy and that's all he needed to be
[3:05:55] <Holycow8498> Luke was kind of a winy brat in 4
[3:05:56] <+silvery_cricket> he is such a dweeb
[3:05:56] <+onlypuppet> I see reflections almost everywhere
[3:06:11] <ittla> especially back in the 70s when nobody made big dumb space movies
[3:06:12] <mortelkilll> i liek the idea that luke had to understand the dark side to accomplish himself
[3:06:22] <MarylandJutsu> oh I dont think anyone is defending Kylo's lightsaber
[3:06:29] <mortelkilll> a normal crossguard would have been fine
[3:06:29] <Ipsenscastle> Have her solve the problem with scavenger knowledge sometimes, instead of brute plot force
[3:06:37] <+silvery_cricket> Plague the explination for his lightsaber is he made it to look cool thats it
[3:06:40] <InsanityMethods> Did you read the leaks, Plague?
[3:06:41] <MarylandJutsu> I did like Bitter grumpy old man Lukethough. I had fun with that
[3:06:47] <Betofall> I always assumed his lightsaber was made poorly, but its never stated so w/e
[3:06:50] <mortelkilll> having rey learn stuff would be good instead of just havign it when she need
[3:07:08] <+Super_General_Guy> The saber works well cause Kylo is an edgy teenager and he thought it would look cool
[3:07:15] <MarylandJutsu> i mean @mortelkilll its also s problem with having different writers for different episodes
[3:07:15] <InsanityMethods> Rey has the same Force Echo power Cal has, so she can just download skill.
[3:07:16] <Jdrockefeller> maul's double ended already seemed extremely dangerous
[3:07:47] <MarylandJutsu> Thougs on this small Robot boy Plauge?
[3:07:50] <Daxalog> It wouldnt be as striking though
[3:07:58] <MarylandJutsu> thoughts
[3:08:05] <mortelkilll> i have no idea why they have different writers
[3:08:11] <mortelkilll> it break all unity
[3:08:18] <MarylandJutsu> Yeppppp
[3:08:22] <Lapinelis> To be absolutely fair, there is absolutely nothing about lightsabers that isn't stupid.
[3:08:29] <mortelkilll> they could just admit that some designs are dumb and edgy
[3:08:49] <JonseyMcDanes> tbh I dont know why anyone had any expectations for the disney starwars movies after the pre-qs
[3:08:52] <Betofall> I gave up after seeing the helicopter lightsabers
[3:08:56] <jersmall> THE REAL MISSTAKE IS MAKING THE FREAKIN GAY KID FROM SHAMELESS A FKING JEDI
[3:09:02] <jersmall> NO THX
[3:09:12] <ChrisM341> Just think, if Kingdom Hearts continues, we may eventually see a Keyblade Light Saber
[3:09:15] <+silvery_cricket> my favorite lightsaber is the ones with teh cord
[3:09:18] <ittla> it's an appropriate weapon for a scary monster man but the problem is that maul has literally no character
[3:09:23] <SirMcSlushy> Are those suppolsed to be fuckin' bouncey pads?
[3:09:29] <Holycow8498> At least its not a light whip
[3:09:30] <mortelkilll> maul kidn fo worked without character
[3:09:34] <Betofall> I mean kingdom hearts shamelessly have a character use lightsabers
[3:09:39] <mortelkilll> he was a big monster to fight
[3:09:50] <mortelkilll> no lightsaber force users would be cool
[3:10:01] <SirMcSlushy> Force people who use guns
[3:10:04] <JonseyMcDanes> so the double bladed light saber meta is "ah-ha you thought I'd have a smart weapon but I instead had a dumb one! I outsmarted your outsmarting!"
[3:10:05] <mortelkilll> force guns
[3:10:13] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> or they just beat the shit out of them with their fists.
[3:10:14] <ittla> i just want a star wars story that isnt obsessed with star wars details
[3:10:15] <Lapinelis> There are force users who don't use lightsabers
[3:10:16] <Betofall> It would have been neat if different alien species in the jedi council used other weapons besides the laser sword
[3:10:17] <ChrisM341> didn't someone in Boruto have something akin to a lightsaber as well?
[3:10:20] <mortelkilll> throw the gun and shoot it whiel not holding it
[3:10:22] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Basically,, I want D&D monks as force users
[3:10:27] <ittla> just write a good adventure and fill in the blanks with star wars stuff
[3:10:27] <Ipsenscastle> I want to see someone beaten up with just force manipulation martial arts
[3:10:31] <+onlypuppet> I use string, but not to hurt people
[3:10:32] <ZetsubouxSensei> this kid really needs an air dash
[3:10:37] <SirMcSlushy> Force the gun away from your hand and fire and aim it like 20 feet away from you.
[3:10:59] <mortelkilll> coudl do a lot of flanking by force controlling guns around
[3:11:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:11:02] <+silvery_cricket> I liked that Ashoka turned her blade backwards so she didnt fight like literally every other character
[3:11:04] <KellBeII> mornin Eli
[3:11:11] <$pennykettle_> If Lightsabers are just swords, I want more modern force tech. Force Tank. Force B20 Bomber
[3:11:22] <Lapinelis> I still can't take it that a lightsaber strike isn't just an instant kill
[3:11:33] <Lapinelis> Like a spider shouldn't be need to be bisected 20 times to die
[3:11:43] <mortelkilll> game balance
[3:11:50] <JonseyMcDanes> sab its juicy boody
[3:11:56] <mortelkilll> require skill to make a game where everythign die in one hit
[3:11:58] <SirMcSlushy> Yep :p
[3:12:23] <Holycow8498> Man the Wookies have really dumb naming conventions
[3:12:24] <%Samex_Comex> It's much better then a giant spider
[3:12:26] <ChrisM341> Call it a Slam
[3:12:43] <Ipsenscastle> Call a rabbit a smeerp
[3:12:57] <Holycow8498> Can the Wookie's speak English or do they just make the wookie growls
[3:13:02] <+l3sovikk> looks cooler, though
[3:13:05] <Aydarkzero> but it looks cool Kappa
[3:13:12] <ittla> the real test for star wars is "what do you have left when you take the star wars stuff out"
[3:13:13] <VelkHarone> was always the fan of the pike myslef
[3:13:14] <JonseyMcDanes> I liked how the assassination droid from knights of the old republic pointed out using mines against jedi is useful because they run up to you
[3:13:17] <%Samex_Comex> Star killer did it
[3:13:19] <mortelkilll> lightmace
[3:13:23] <+0range_> just use grenades
[3:13:29] <+CarlosEoM> lightsaber armor
[3:13:30] <mortelkilll> i guess non light weapons
[3:13:33] <SirMcSlushy> Light Laser Eyes
[3:13:37] <VelkHarone> lightsaber pikes were a thing
[3:13:39] <mortelkilll> or force guns
[3:13:39] <Betofall> The Jedi and Sith are oddly obsessed with laser sticks
[3:13:42] <VelkHarone> they just dont use em often
[3:13:42] <ittla> the closes thing to Something New was donnie yen in rogue one, but he didnt do anything
[3:13:43] <kipxart> the backward thing would only be for danger combat. or just bs points
[3:13:49] <%Samex_Comex> Light Ax
[3:13:52] <Ipsenscastle> lightchuks
[3:13:55] <Holycow8498> Didn't the temple guards have light pikes?
[3:13:58] <JonseyMcDanes> light club
[3:14:05] <Ipsenscastle> lightknuckledusters
[3:14:06] <VelkHarone> yeah temple guards did have pikes
[3:14:06] <Lapinelis> It's kinda the anime power problem. All fights get reduced to sword fights because sword fights are the rule of cool
[3:14:08] <Holycow8498> I feel like light pikes do exist
[3:14:09] <JonseyMcDanes> light slingshot
[3:14:25] <mortelkilll> feel like force guns really would be it
[3:14:33] <JonseyMcDanes> light lock in a sock
[3:14:37] <SirMcSlushy> Light Saber, but its a literal boomerang.
[3:14:42] <ChrisM341> Lightcondom
[3:14:51] <JonseyMcDanes> light after pill
[3:14:54] <SirMcSlushy> So like a Kukri
[3:14:55] <%Samex_Comex> Feel the force
[3:15:00] <mortelkilll> can force users just use punches and kicks?
[3:15:04] <mortelkilll> force kong fu
[3:15:06] <ittla> plague how do you feal about the Dark Saber lol
[3:15:08] <+Barpity> I understand your an important jedi with stuff to do but why are you running around killing animals?
[3:15:08] <lennyrager> There is a boss in force unleashed that uses a light spear
[3:15:35] <SirMcSlushy> Just cover your body in a shield of the shit light sabers project, and then hug people.
[3:15:39] <Lapinelis> @Barpity He kinda isn't an important jedi and he doens't have anything important to do
[3:15:42] <+silvery_cricket> light trident
[3:15:43] <ChrisM341> Captain Jedi and his LightShield
[3:15:52] <JonseyMcDanes> the tusin raiders had light muskets and the wookies had light crossbows, when do we get light blow guns
[3:15:55] <+silvery_cricket> light trident with a light net
[3:16:05] <Betofall> they need to optimize that poke capability
[3:16:10] <+Barpity> 'ight fair enough
[3:16:11] <+l3sovikk> from below, maybe?
[3:16:14] <mortelkilll> light knucles
[3:16:33] <ittla> star wars is too busy trying to sell its brand that they forgot how to make things compelling
[3:16:42] <mortelkilll> speaking of boring, i dont find the stormtrooper super fun
[3:16:44] <+Barpity> But still wheres space peta?
[3:16:47] <mortelkilll> the droids were better
[3:16:54] <mortelkilll> more funny, more threathening
[3:16:59] <JonseyMcDanes> is there a reason why almost no one uses regular guns in star wars? I know there were normal guns in the lore
[3:16:59] <bazz_tv> i miss Kyle Katarn and Mara Jade
[3:17:02] <ChrisM341> Light Yagami, I just want Jedi and Sith just swinging around his body in fights
[3:17:03] <mortelkilll> depending o nthe numbers and types
[3:17:15] <mortelkilll> i feel like force users could use force guns
[3:17:39] <mortelkilll> or even normal guns and use their power to guide their shots
[3:17:57] <+onlypuppet> Manipulating Light that much sounds like a bad idea
[3:18:42] <bazz_tv> has Plague given an overall opinion of the game yet? most people have say is ok but meh
[3:18:55] <JonseyMcDanes> @mortelkilll hell they can use force choke, why not force brain squeeze?
[3:18:56] <mortelkilll> gameplay is fine but story is dumb so far
[3:18:56] <Holycow8498> They are just watching you derp around
[3:19:19] <Holycow8498> Imagine those 3 schmucks just watching you fucking derp around
[3:19:25] <$pennykettle_> Force Pinch Your Intestines
[3:19:29] <+onlypuppet> Lmao
[3:19:39] <mortelkilll> @JonseyMcDanes just killing people with force attacks? that would be deadly
[3:19:40] <ZetsubouxSensei> it's awful
[3:20:09] <Sunstalker> You were asking if they wrote this internally earlier. Chris Avellon worked on the writing for this game.
[3:20:24] <JonseyMcDanes> @mortelkilll u right, most we can hope for is force no-no touch
[3:20:40] <Holycow8498> Yeah Chris Avelon did do some writing for the game
[3:21:19] <mortelkilll> could se eforce users just creating force showckwaves by punchign and kicking
[3:21:22] <Lapinelis> Well, this is the first game the studio released that has melee combat
[3:21:25] <Lapinelis> afaik
[3:21:34] <bazz_tv> whenever I see wall running it just makes me want to play Prince of Persia
[3:21:48] <mortelkilll> sure its dumb rule of cool stuff but its not lightsabers
[3:21:52] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no the wookies
[3:21:59] <Holycow8498> I still don't understand how the wookies look so bad
[3:22:07] <Holycow8498> How do you fuck up the Wookies
[3:22:16] <JonseyMcDanes> ape man legs look dum skinny
[3:22:17] <Betofall> their fur texture isn't very good
[3:22:26] <$pennykettle_> How does a lightsaber work submerged in water
[3:22:29] <Holycow8498> Tarful has 3 dicks
[3:22:29] <ittla> the concept of The Wookie should've just stayed as han's dog copilot
[3:22:35] <mortelkilll> they use textures instead of rendering hair
[3:22:42] <ittla> but then lucas decided that there should be a whole planet full of screaming dog men
[3:22:49] <+onlypuppet> Try fish oils maybe
[3:22:52] <Betofall> I think the brown one's head is too big
[3:22:57] <bazz_tv> @pennykettle_ kitt fisto did it in Genndy's clone wars
[3:22:58] <+l3sovikk> His fur is combed out better
[3:23:03] <mortelkilll> thye look like people in costumes
[3:23:09] <mortelkilll> 'even more than the actual people in costumes
[3:23:13] <Holycow8498> It looks like somebody put a dog in water and then just left it there
[3:23:32] <mortelkilll> also they dont move in interesting ways
[3:23:36] <bazz_tv> the lightsaber was constantly boiling the water around it making it look cool
[3:23:38] <JonseyMcDanes> poor slugmun
[3:23:52] <JonseyMcDanes> he just wannaa do a slither
[3:24:05] <mortelkilll> god why is the holiday special canon
[3:24:24] <mortelkilll> oh right, its to punish humanity for their hubris
[3:24:56] <ittla> but it's a cool force push!!!
[3:25:05] <ittla> isnt the force cool????
[3:25:06] <+goatseatingcoins> maybe as a defense skill?
[3:25:24] <llukemiller> U just suck
[3:25:25] <bazz_tv> man it makes God of boy controls feel like Devil May cry in comparison
[3:25:29] <bear_breaker20> didnt think plague would play this game, you just like that cameron monaghan booty Kappa
[3:25:37] <ChrisM341> Maybe you can push them back to heal?
[3:25:39] <llukemiller> The games fine
[3:25:56] <ChrisM341> That's the only thing I can think of with that
[3:26:03] <bazz_tv> certainly not a stinger
[3:26:10] <mortelkilll> feel like most force powers are utilitary
[3:26:19] <mortelkilll> not super useful for direct combat
[3:26:23] <mortelkilll> more for precisio nstuff
[3:26:36] <@Nightbot> @SirMcSlushy -> You done? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[3:26:48] <bazz_tv> to be fair force speed was almost broken in jedi outcast
[3:26:49] <SirMcSlushy> squidSMRT
[3:27:22] <Betofall> odd way to mourn
[3:27:35] <ChrisM341> I never really got into Star Wars. are there any games that you all would suggest I try?
[3:27:43] <mortelkilll> yeah doesnt sound like a language
[3:27:48] <SirMcSlushy> Suddenly its Sekiro water explorarion, but probably more.
[3:27:49] <ittla> screaming dog men
[3:27:54] <Betofall> kotor 1 and 2 are fun rpgs
[3:27:55] <+TQuick101> I wonder of Wookie's have accents
[3:28:16] <mortelkilll> chewbaka mostly communicated trough his movement
[3:28:18] <bazz_tv> @chrism341 Jedi Outcast and Academy for jedi stuff
[3:28:27] <ittla> kashyyyk in kotor 1 is such a fucking nightmare because it's just wookie screams for hours
[3:28:38] <Betofall> when do you carry emma?
[3:28:42] <bazz_tv> rouge squadron for flight
[3:28:47] <ittla> never put the wookie planet in a dialogue-heavy game
[3:28:50] <bazz_tv> Kotor for story
[3:28:55] <ChrisM341> I'll look then all up, thanks for the suggestions
[3:28:58] <bearalin> @chrism341 republic commando for some first person shooting
[3:29:03] <SirMcSlushy> Wow
[3:29:16] <bazz_tv> Star Wars pod racing for F Zero esque racing
[3:29:25] <mortelkilll> cant make non videogame map for such a videogamey level
[3:29:37] <mortelkilll> hot take, pod racing was kind of amazing
[3:29:42] <SirMcSlushy> xD
[3:29:44] <mortelkilll> wait is that unpopular?
[3:29:46] <ChrisM341> I think the only star wars games I've played/like was Battlefront 2 (ps2) and Force Unleashed (the psps version)
[3:30:12] <bazz_tv> be warn n64 podracing usually has a lot of framedrops
[3:30:24] <bazz_tv> Dreamcast versión is better
[3:30:30] <ittla> i liked the pod racing video game when i was a literal child
[3:30:36] <bazz_tv> but the sequel wasn't as good
[3:30:46] <mortelkilll> i also liked the underwater scenes as useless as it was
[3:30:55] <mortelkilll> wit hthe giant fishes
[3:31:10] <mortelkilll> i also liked qui gon, he was like this really weird kind of bad teacher
[3:31:11] <+onlypuppet> Oh, my heart
[3:31:36] <bazz_tv> jedi power battles in the ps1 was good too
[3:31:37] <ittla> 'funny alien waving its arms and then an explosion' pretty much describes every action scene from the prequels
[3:31:44] <ChrisM341> I'm no stranger to frame drops, played like 60% of deadpool on pc despite how slow the game was due to how bad my pc is
[3:31:46] <mortelkilll> made sense that qui gon was pretty much hated by the other jedis but he also wasnt as dogmatic as them
[3:32:00] <Betofall> why are they fighting them, just walk away
[3:32:21] <+zero_g_toad> how are you hating or liking fallen ginger?
[3:32:31] <bazz_tv> and the GBA had two good Star Wars games, the Star Wars Trilogy unisoft game and the episode III beat em up
[3:32:38] <ChrisM341> @bazz_tv I remember playing that at a friends house when I was little
[3:32:57] <ChrisM341> And forgot the gba ones, I enjoyed the Episode 3 one but got stuck on a level
[3:33:01] <ittla> storm troopers that die in two hits and beasts that ignore mechanics, A+ design
[3:33:02] <+zero_g_toad> are you jealous he has a full head of hair? @plagueofgripes
[3:33:15] <ZetsubouxSensei> I think they mean for you to parry them for an instant kill or somthing, rather than making the monsters fun
[3:33:47] <Betofall> when luke meets his very best friend before they go to the death star
[3:33:48] <bazz_tv> what was the empire strike back issue?
[3:34:19] <ittla> the problem is that star wars was just supposed to be a silly fantasy adventure in the early 80s
[3:34:29] <Krimxon> yeh but podracing tho Kappa
[3:34:32] <ittla> but then it all fell apart when lucas tried to explain every little detail
[3:34:39] <mortelkilll> i realise i liekd a lot of phantom menace
[3:35:14] <mortelkilll> i liked the trade alliance, pod racing, qui gon, the gungan (exept jar jar), the sea monsters scene
[3:35:20] <mortelkilll> even the stupdi war at the end
[3:35:21] <bear_breaker20> prequels are the Evanescence of the cgi era
[3:35:23] <mistermastergreg> PAT IS A FUCK
[3:35:33] <Betofall> The new movies give me no context to how the rebels/first order affect the rest of the galaxy. Like they feel like two small group of assholes who feel like they are more important than they actually are
[3:35:34] <%Samex_Comex> Oh boy here they come
[3:36:03] <bazz_tv> the best thing about the prequels was Genndy Tartakovsky's Clone wars
[3:36:12] <mortelkilll> rebel and first order are just ripoffs of the empire and rebels
[3:36:14] <ChrisM341> ForceSaber
[3:36:24] <mortelkilll> exept worse and more non sensical
[3:36:25] <+onlypuppet> They remind me of the boys that think lesbian means bi
[3:36:33] <ittla> genndy's star wars is easily the best modern star wars
[3:36:42] <ChrisM341> ForceChokeJerk
[3:36:50] <mortelkilll> killing people is good, chocking is wrong
[3:36:52] <bazz_tv> Jedi Outcast
[3:36:53] <+polypolipauli> Hey chat, I watched Abraham Lincoln fight Kahless last night, it was rad
[3:36:55] <Schuhart> Kyle was a maverick bad-ass
[3:37:15] <mortelkilll> man i hate the self richeousness of jedi
[3:37:15] <ittla> 'so uncivilized' - obi wan kenobi after not using a god damned laser sword
[3:37:29] <bazz_tv> Kyle was a jedi yet he could Force Choke and Force Lightning
[3:37:32] <Betofall> George tried to warn us what happens when volcels get too powerful
[3:37:35] <Krimxon> when's Mara Jade?
[3:37:37] <+onlypuppet> Uhhh who’s being sacrificed not?
[3:37:40] <mortelkilll> id say the gun is way less barbaric than the freakin sword
[3:37:48] <+onlypuppet> *now
[3:37:56] <bazz_tv> hell Luke could do force lightning in the novels
[3:38:39] <bazz_tv> they had mandalorian jet packs
[3:38:41] <mortelkilll> most videogames dont think this far
[3:39:04] <bazz_tv> and the run out of fuel right when you arrived
[3:39:34] <ChrisM341> How did he talk underwater?
[3:39:46] <ChrisM341> Is that a thing people can do?
[3:39:51] <Betofall> with the force, duh
[3:39:57] <T_Sasquatch> !uptime
[3:39:58] <@Nightbot> 3 hours 40 minutes 8 seconds

[3:40:09] <mistermastergreg> "Darth Cindy"
[3:40:21] <ChrisM341> Force Talk
[3:40:26] <mortelkilll> jedi handjobbing mostly
[3:40:28] <RedKnightEmiya> What's up Plague!!!
[3:40:36] <mortelkilll> the jedi were mroe tyrants than hope
[3:40:40] <T_Sasquatch> It's so uncharted in it's movement , It hurts
[3:40:57] <+onlypuppet> Mom says my boy name would’ve been Luke, but I knew a boy named Luke and his friends called him Lucifer. I remember facepalming hard, but that was a long time ago
[3:41:32] <bazz_tv> sounds like "WE WERE NOT TEMPLARS THIS INQUISITORS ARE BAD"
[3:41:39] <bear_breaker20> wha but "theres is no source material"
[3:42:05] <RedKnightEmiya> star wars was always bad
[3:42:10] <mortelkilll> the luke handjobs are so annoying
[3:42:15] <+eanscrale> Palpatine is back again though.
[3:42:49] <mortelkilll> palpatine back alright
[3:42:51] <bazz_tv> Han's novel kids were alright though
[3:43:02] <%Samex_Comex> Oh man this is getting hot
[3:43:43] <ChrisM341> "You're gonna die here" - Mark
[3:43:47] <T_Sasquatch> I was never really mad at the last Jedi but man as a trilogy its awful
[3:43:59] <Betofall> its ogre now
[3:44:02] <$pennykettle_> hes cartoonishly colored
[3:44:03] <+Shotgundam009> Darth Shrek
[3:44:09] <+CursedNobleman> SOME BODY ONE TOLD ME THE FORCE WAS GONNA ROLL ME
[3:44:15] <+onlypuppet> I didn’t watch any of the movies until like last year, and I still don’t get it
[3:44:16] <seth45er> the Vong
[3:44:19] <ittla> lol
[3:44:20] <+TQuick101> Was he even able to hear her? She was pretty far away
[3:44:21] <mistermastergreg> but then they forgot all of the new things they did, I mean there's a comic about the knights of ren
[3:44:25] <ChrisM341> I ain't the sharpest Sith in the Shed
[3:44:28] <DC0118> the thrawn books were the only post return of the jedi thing I'll defend
[3:44:37] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Looking forward to this ride in DisneyWorld.
[3:44:42] <bazz_tv> did they retcon Cortosis and the Valley of the Jedi?
[3:44:59] <mortelkilll> i dont really care about any part of the star wars universe
[3:45:13] <seth45er> yuzhan vong i think
[3:46:03] <T_Sasquatch> Thrawn saved the rebels animated series
[3:46:19] <Krimxon> LUL
[3:46:21] <ChrisM341> This reminds me of Ride with Norman Reedus on AMC
[3:46:22] <mortelkilll> it totally is
[3:46:28] <ZetsubouxSensei> LIVE AND LEARN
[3:46:31] <T_Sasquatch> Its an auto scroller LUL
[3:46:32] <+Shotgundam009> We'll escape from the swamp
[3:46:43] <Betofall> lets escape from kashyyk
[3:46:43] <%Samex_Comex> You got to escape Eggman
[3:46:48] <Krimxon> this game looks like classic AAA all polish no soul gaming
[3:46:48] <+eanscrale> Yeah I only got into sci-fi through TNG. I mostly thought of starwars of "hey cool, robots"
[3:46:53] <+Shotgundam009> Follow me set me free
[3:46:54] <bazz_tv> is literally the sonic adventure 2 forest level
[3:46:57] <Betofall> wtf
[3:47:07] <Betofall> that looked odd
[3:47:13] <%Samex_Comex> Did that dragon just explode?
[3:47:16] <+Shotgundam009> lol
[3:47:18] <ittla> im feeling second hand embarrassment at this sonic the hedgehog sequence
[3:47:22] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:47:33] <T_Sasquatch> Respawn sigh. I expected more
[3:48:10] <T_Sasquatch> I don't think this game has a single unique thing about it
[3:48:12] <AnacondaVirtue> Nah she's still alive
[3:48:19] <$pennykettle_> "Sopping Wet Poncho"
[3:48:23] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Green
[3:48:26] <+CursedNobleman> taupe LUL
[3:48:29] <mortelkilll> bronzium Kappa
[3:48:30] <mistermastergreg> I bet than water smells
[3:48:32] <mistermastergreg> that
[3:48:33] <T_Sasquatch> Bronzy
[3:48:36] <+Shaggnar> Yes
[3:48:38] <ChrisM341> Open it up and it's the Zora Suit
[3:48:39] <mortelkilll> just freaki ncall it plastic
[3:48:42] <Aydarkzero> thats dumb
[3:48:43] <$pennykettle_> Plastisteel is a cool word tho
[3:48:45] <Betofall> waxed in woodoo hide
[3:48:50] <+eanscrale> It's Pleel the strongest of pletals
[3:48:59] <Aydarkzero> Plasteel would sounded better
[3:49:03] <%Samex_Comex> Ooooh my bone marrow
[3:49:10] <mortelkilll> bronzium, because just making freaki nbronze is beneath you
[3:49:25] <mortelkilll> i get that some new metal may show up in space but dotn just make the mripoff of real ones
[3:49:29] <lennyrager> Tbf star trek has transparent aluminum
[3:49:34] <bear_breaker20> almost as cool as unobtanium
[3:49:36] <Aydarkzero> wut
[3:49:41] <AnacondaVirtue> Well what would you call it, then
[3:49:45] <Betofall> according to lore, his suit is so needlessy shitty because palpatine though it would be funny
[3:49:49] <snipers_legacy> maplewPepegaATST maplewPepegaATST
[3:49:54] <Finchit> wow this game is busted.
[3:49:55] <Krimxon> Shelob!
[3:50:03] <mrpopoison> Pathing... the only weakness of the giant spider
[3:50:05] <mortelkilll> its fun when thigns are aknowledged to be shit in canon
[3:50:06] <Aydarkzero> didn't palpatine also make his suit really weak to electric attacks
[3:50:08] <ChrisM341> Unobtanium, I've heard that before, where is that from?
[3:50:13] <mortelkilll> avatar
[3:50:19] <T_Sasquatch> Loooool
[3:50:28] <mortelkilll> they litteraly called the precious metal they were looking for unobtainium
[3:50:40] <+eanscrale> They let you make Revan, I don't see what the big deal is
[3:50:41] <+Shaggnar> I just wish he didn't walk like he shat himself
[3:50:47] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:50:48] <Mrbaconator> it would be better if you were just playing as arnold swarzenegger
[3:50:53] <bear_breaker20> @Betofall he made it shitty incase vader ever rebelled Kappa
[3:50:55] <$pennykettle_> I dont want to talk about Sekiro but the game could have been better if it werent a half ass character
[3:50:55] <+onlypuppet> Ideas for the future
[3:51:09] <T_Sasquatch> Wow that's rough
[3:51:12] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> You can do it little guy!
[3:51:12] <ChrisM341> @mortelkilll Thanks
[3:51:22] <mortelkilll> you mean this or sekiro ?
[3:51:22] <+Shaggnar> katieDerp spoder
[3:51:25] <+CursedNobleman> i like spiders, but that maks me uncomfortable
[3:51:27] <ittla> motion blur hell
[3:51:28] <mortelkilll> i found wolf to be decent i nsekiro
[3:51:28] <mistermastergreg> @PlagueOfGripes I wanna play as a big tittied bug sith lady thing but the game doesn't let me
[3:51:29] <Finchit> woah these dashes are nuts
[3:51:41] <bazz_tv> bring up the dancing spiders
[3:51:54] <+CursedNobleman> @mistermastergreg you want to play as lightsabre devorah LUL
[3:51:54] <mortelkilll> this guy is super bland trough
[3:51:59] <T_Sasquatch> Ledges, the final boss
[3:52:05] <mistermastergreg> yeah pretty much
[3:52:07] <Kiraklene> twerk
[3:52:31] <bear_breaker20> id say they needed more qa time
[3:52:41] <ZetsubouxSensei> definitely a lack of qa
[3:52:43] <+TQuick101> because dark souls did it
[3:52:57] <bazz_tv> the spiders are drunk
[3:53:32] <ChrisM341> Still think Slam would be a better name for a Slug Ram combination
[3:54:01] <ittla> a combat designed for fighting humans in a game full of beasts
[3:54:33] <+onlypuppet> So cute though
[3:54:40] <$m0pyz> Cheer1 I give one bit cuz im poor
[3:55:03] <bazz_tv> inb4 they say the did it on purpose because Jedi aren't suppose to fight nature
[3:55:20] <XombiePunkTV> Whaddup Plague
[3:55:43] <Betofall> take our word for it, its intricate
[3:55:45] <+l3sovikk> Plague, why do you play games you hate?
[3:55:52] <mortelkilll> shadow of war at least modeled al lthe artifacts
[3:55:58] <+eanscrale> Isn't it all just ponchos
[3:56:00] <XombiePunkTV> I take it Plague doesnt care much for this game so far?
[3:56:04] <mortelkilll> plagues love to gripes
[3:56:11] <T_Sasquatch> His name is plague of gripes, what do you expect LUL
[3:56:11] <$pennykettle_> I hope to god one of the ponchos has a big Star Wars logo on the chest
[3:56:13] <mortelkilll> hes lukewarm
[3:56:31] <+CursedNobleman> id rather play an outlaw star video game LUL
[3:56:33] <XombiePunkTV> @mortelkilll lukeskywalkerwarm Keepo
[3:56:44] <ittla> lmao are you for real
[3:56:47] <mortelkilll> slowly gettign worse trough
[3:56:50] <ittla> a codec entry for a god damned crate
[3:56:55] <SophisticHades> high quality game
[3:57:21] <mortelkilll> his final opignon probably gonna sway a lot depending o nthe final boss quality
[3:58:04] <mistermastergreg> @l3sovikk I think he's just trying to find something he likes rather
[3:58:17] <+l3sovikk> fair
[3:58:22] <mortelkilll> id say since the story the big focus and its the worst part, probably gonna end more negative than positive
[3:58:48] <mortelkilll> also its more fun to complain than praise a middle of the road game
[3:58:48] <ittla> at least this game's design isnt lazy enough to just give you a double jump
[3:59:01] <bazz_tv> shouldn't force user be able to pacify/manipulate wild life?
[3:59:28] <mortelkilll> kashick at least loo kpretty nice
[3:59:34] <mortelkilll> not all planet have this much life
[4:00:02] <ittla> rip darth shrek
[4:00:20] <Kiraklene> As long as the character isn't impaled they're probably alive is what i go by
[4:00:20] <Betofall> I'm assuming she survived
[4:00:23] <+ShogunNoonto> hello
[4:00:43] <Betofall> its easy to survive explosions in video games and movies
[4:00:48] <mortelkilll> because yo uare the protagonist
[4:00:56] <ittla> is video game
[4:01:06] <mortelkilll> protagonist attract everything o nsight
[4:01:09] <ittla> dont ask questions just consume game
[4:01:12] <T_Sasquatch> ??
[4:01:13] <mortelkilll> whut
[4:01:15] <+TQuick101> oh look, madman's knowledge
[4:01:24] <Schuhart> Seamless
[4:01:26] <Finchit> what a fucking loser this kid is
[4:01:28] <$pennykettle_> oh lord digusting ginger kid
[4:01:40] <ChrisM341> The Healing Stems are kicking in
[4:01:41] <Longerbone_ghm> Good! KEEP FAILING. XD
[4:01:47] <Betofall> Jaro Tapal wrote alot of feel good books
[4:01:48] <ittla> omfg
[4:01:52] <ittla> i spoke too soon
[4:01:55] <Sunstalker> Oh, god he looks like the ginger snitch from that cartoon about schoolkids and the playground
[4:01:56] <+zero_g_toad> RISE UP JEDI GAMERS yugwhaWeird
[4:01:57] <%Samex_Comex> The Jedi flip
[4:01:58] <bazz_tv> oh no the younglings
[4:02:03] <$pennykettle_> so wait he forgot how to do this until now
[4:02:08] <ittla> congratulations now all platforming is ezpz
[4:02:09] <mortelkilll> does flipping actually give you more air?
[4:02:17] <mortelkilll> i feel like thats game bullshit
[4:02:30] <mortelkilll> probably explaiend at the last minute
[4:02:43] <Betofall> is there helicopter shrapnel lodged in his brain?
[4:02:49] <Aydarkzero> he said he cut himself off b/c he felt to strong or w/e
[4:03:00] <Kiraklene> Group hug
[4:03:00] <+zero_g_toad> stormtrooper gangbang
[4:03:03] <SophisticHades> gangbang time
[4:03:09] <bazz_tv> @mortelkilll if something makes no sense, its usually the force
[4:03:26] <+ShogunNoonto> force gangbang ?
[4:03:26] <AnacondaVirtue> Lack of use, mostly. Didn't want to reveal himself
[4:03:49] <mortelkilll> do you have a spin attack?
[4:04:00] <$pennykettle_> that looks retarded LUL
[4:04:00] <mortelkilll> the gangbang would only be useful if you can spin attack
[4:04:16] <bazz_tv> they should give you a Bayonetta dodge
[4:04:29] <bazz_tv> with Witch Time and everything
[4:05:00] <ChrisM341> And BD gives Cal lollipops for health items
[4:05:17] <ChrisM341> I think I mixed up games for a second there
[4:05:22] <bazz_tv> they can call it Midiclorian Time
[4:05:29] <ChrisM341> Maybe thinking of lollipop chainsaw
[4:05:38] <+zero_g_toad> would have been better if they called the stim packs "injectus" or somerhing
[4:05:47] <+askalta> I'll make plague some lunch. utah fried chicken
[4:05:48] <bazz_tv> bayo also has lolipops chris
[4:05:49] <Betofall> the animations on that thing are screwy
[4:05:58] <RiverBirch> Whats that Monster Hunter Wyvern dropping in on Starwars?
[4:06:11] <ChrisM341> Ah okay, I haven't played it in a while so thought I was mixing it up
[4:06:59] <bazz_tv> people tend to forget because using consumable items is a big no no in character action games
[4:07:04] <Betofall> kino
[4:07:19] <mortelkilll> they want yo uto appreciate the world design
[4:07:33] <mortelkilll> its not the worst looking level in the game
[4:07:48] <Betofall> the movies need more jedi falling on their asses
[4:07:59] <mistermastergreg> I bet the whole planet smells
[4:08:02] <AnacondaVirtue> Then...just wait? Those things were right in front of you
[4:08:08] <+onlypuppet> Something about dragon kin? Sorry my connection went weak
[4:08:38] <mortelkilll> and now that yo ustolen it the dragon god will attack again
[4:08:38] <bazz_tv> how are you suppose to know where are you going anyway?
[4:08:42] <mortelkilll> you doomed the wookies
[4:08:47] <ChrisM341> Dragon born Poncho
[4:09:55] <$pennykettle_> can someone remind me why we are even here? I feel like i blacked out since the battle arena
[4:10:10] <mortelkilll> climb the bigass tree
[4:10:20] <mortelkilll> because progress is there
[4:10:32] <mortelkilll> also help defend wookies and pretty girl i guess
[4:10:49] <$pennykettle_> Can jedi force parachute out of a ship onto the top of the tree
[4:10:55] <mortelkilll> nope
[4:10:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:11:03] <+onlypuppet> Double jump?
[4:11:12] <Betofall> no but they can force teleport when the fuck up
[4:11:13] <ChrisM341> Star Wars: Jedi Falling
[4:11:29] <Lapinelis> Watching this made me want to install kotor 2, lol
[4:11:50] <mortelkilll> man this tree tall
[4:11:57] <mortelkilll> feel like we ve been climbing for a while
[4:12:14] <mistermastergreg> so how does this level design compares to something like prince of persia?
[4:12:53] <RiverBirch> This level has a nice Aesthetic.
[4:12:54] <Betofall> well in prince of persia it always feels like its my fault and not the game when i fall
[4:12:58] <RiverBirch> And yes, it does
[4:13:06] <mistermastergreg> hmmm...
[4:13:10] <+askalta> it looks exactly like one
[4:13:31] <+onlypuppet> Air and earth?
[4:13:45] <srkAres> could make a good hammer out of those horns
[4:13:48] <$pennykettle_> weve been slaughtering all animals, now we find one with a fucking thorn in its paw and we help it and it flies us to the top, fucking whoopee
[4:13:51] <ChrisM341> Just Force Choke it to let you know you mean no harm
[4:13:58] <+rdark_ksu> this bird is a bitch
[4:14:10] <+askalta> im sure youd love to go jogging with a steak knife in your shin
[4:14:12] <ittla> the first animal he didnt murder
[4:14:12] <+onlypuppet> Bye baby
[4:14:14] <mortelkilll> welp now to fight zombies girl
[4:14:24] <mortelkilll> or some other rando mboss
[4:14:25] <Betofall> you have to remove more ship splinters later
[4:14:31] <RiverBirch> So we're going with the RE:4 Dog approach to healing random animals in the forest?
[4:14:42] <+MurlinDurl> naboo starfighter
[4:14:46] <+Bonerlord911> very naboo starfighter
[4:14:55] <+onlypuppet> Whoops, it’s a long story
[4:15:05] <+Bonerlord911> that's not black that's chrome!
[4:15:05] <%Samex_Comex> bumblebee ship
[4:15:34] <ittla> this game sure is a hallway
[4:15:48] <+zero_g_toad> endo cordova more like endo after the first sentence
[4:15:48] <mistermastergreg> pick the black one, the one that has black on it
[4:15:52] <zero_g_toad> yugwhaWeird
[4:16:03] <SuperVaderMan> I see we have one of those Avatar dragon bird things
[4:16:06] <+MurlinDurl> that animal could of taken you anywhere
[4:16:13] <mortelkilll> it kind of work i nthis level since yo uclibm a tree
[4:16:20] <%Samex_Comex> The never ending story!
[4:16:22] <mortelkilll> some other levels look really artificial
[4:16:23] <ChrisM341> Flying Minigame?
[4:16:30] <$pennykettle_> OH GOD the closer clouds were in FRONT of the bird wings
[4:16:42] <SuperVaderMan> does it have transparent bug wings???
[4:16:42] <+MurlinDurl> you are the beast lord
[4:16:43] <ittla> are you impressed by the Star War
[4:16:47] <RiverBirch> I wanna take off that bird's head and use it as a helmet in MHW
[4:16:50] <%Samex_Comex> Falkor!
[4:16:53] <Zalthin> i feel empty
[4:16:56] <+onlypuppet> I feel encroaching doom
[4:16:57] <+Bonerlord911> when eno cordova speaks i only hear Khadgar from world of warcraft
[4:17:11] <ChrisM341> Harry Potter did it better Kappa
[4:17:19] <ittla> just like the movies huh
[4:17:22] <Aydarkzero> what a mystical creature
[4:17:25] <Tiny_Axolotl> jarrasic park?
[4:17:29] <mortelkilll> lets be honest, n oammount of set up could make me feel for baby face jedi
[4:17:29] <+zero_g_toad> i feel like i need to poop
[4:17:34] <+MurlinDurl> this bird builds lightsabers
[4:18:04] <Tiny_Axolotl> Does that moment constitute as artificial empowerment?
[4:18:04] <$pennykettle_> Premium Content
[4:19:09] <$pennykettle_> yes
[4:19:23] <+onlypuppet> Depends how you construct it, the tools are important
[4:19:24] <mortelkilll> i like tape, make it look like we repaired it ourselves
[4:19:29] <+Bonerlord911> i like the Eno Cordova emitters cause they look like Obi Wan's
[4:19:31] <Tiny_Axolotl> What's the point of customizing the handle we can barley see it, no?
[4:19:34] <mortelkilll> and we suck as repairing
[4:19:45] <Betofall> your red hair makes you the rudolph of the jedi
[4:20:08] <+Bonerlord911> you can literally get white plastic later
[4:20:11] <+CarlosEoM> plasticium doesnt sound as good
[4:20:14] <+Bonerlord911> stormtrooper armour lightsaber
[4:20:23] <mortelkilll> look like wood
[4:20:39] <mortelkilll> a wood lightsaber could be cool
[4:20:47] <mortelkilll> whos this guy?
[4:20:55] <+Bonerlord911> he climbed with tarfful
[4:21:15] <+MurlinDurl> ancient wookiee secret Kappa
[4:21:15] <Aydarkzero> it's that guy!
[4:21:23] <Murphio_GS> Da force
[4:21:24] <+Bonerlord911> climbing the tree is a rite of passage for brave wookiees
[4:21:25] <SuperVaderMan> Tarrful gave him a piggyback ride :)
[4:21:29] <+Bonerlord911> tarfful probably saw it there himself
[4:21:44] <%Samex_Comex> All praise the force
[4:22:10] <Betofall> your dragon uber
[4:22:11] <ChrisM341> ^ Darth Vader Died for our sins
[4:22:13] <Murphio_GS> Star wars dinosaur
[4:22:28] <mortelkilll> should have known
[4:22:35] <Betofall> at least she has a backup ship
[4:22:39] <SuperVaderMan> Time to fight large lady
[4:22:44] <AnacondaVirtue> He took the one here. Gotta go to Dathomir to find one for yourself
[4:22:50] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh hey, it's those dumb spinny things
[4:22:51] <ChrisM341> The Sith start coming and they don't stop coming
[4:22:52] <+rdark_ksu> she has a gammy foot
[4:22:59] <Murphio_GS> Largelady sith PogChamp
[4:23:01] <+onlypuppet> Oh jeez lady
[4:23:03] <mistermastergreg> Bra'tac my bro
[4:23:13] <bear_breaker20> sounds like frieza's henchmen
[4:23:17] <SuperVaderMan> "You're not worth my time" what else do you have to do that's so important, more important than fighting one of the last remaining jedi
[4:23:29] <mortelkilll> girl stuff
[4:23:34] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why are the inquisitors all Women club?
[4:23:50] <mortelkilll> theyr like a cult/coven
[4:23:52] <Murphio_GS> I can't believe they put Liz in star wars
[4:24:00] <bear_breaker20> not allowed in vaders boys club
[4:24:16] <mortelkilll> i think their group meant to be liek a witches coven
[4:24:16] <%Samex_Comex> it's no use!
[4:24:17] <ittla> gotta make the Star Wars hard like the Dark Souls
[4:24:25] <auhsojnala> Only just popping in. Is this Kashyyyk or another planet?
[4:24:31] <mortelkilll> are male witches a thing?
[4:24:35] <Tiny_Axolotl> How do you sign up to become an inquisitor anyway?
[4:24:39] <+Bonerlord911> phase 2
[4:24:45] <Aydarkzero> dual blade!
[4:24:45] <mortelkilll> think theyr called warlock but i dont see much of them
[4:24:55] <+MurlinDurl> needs a yo mama joke Kappa
[4:24:57] <mortelkilll> and not usually within witch covens
[4:25:04] <ChrisM341> Playground Insults
[4:25:04] <+killfrost11> OHH~ its the stuipd spin saber
[4:25:07] <Betofall> them iframes
[4:25:08] <+ratchetex> god I hate chonky alien designs like that
[4:25:19] <+Bonerlord911> eli, you know you can heal, right?
[4:25:22] <mortelkilll> heh i like having some body diversity
[4:25:30] <mortelkilll> i hate when all the aliens just look like reskinned humans
[4:25:42] <mortelkilll> its not even that far from humans, humans can get chonky
[4:25:47] <Tiny_Axolotl> @mortelkilll me too
[4:25:56] <Aydarkzero> dismemberment only happens if let it Kappa
[4:26:04] <plsletmemakeaccount> I kinda wish they emphasized the political ideologies more with the character dialogue
[4:26:05] <+ratchetex> no totally but so many times it's just a big human
[4:26:09] <mortelkilll> good point
[4:26:17] <+onlypuppet> I heard the fairies were going extinct, I hope that’s not true
[4:26:22] <Betofall> hmm
[4:26:25] <+Bonerlord911> jump!
[4:26:26] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh noooo
[4:26:28] <Tiny_Axolotl> Dark magic?
[4:26:34] <mortelkilll> i get it ratchet, she is kind of just a larger and taller human proportion wise
[4:26:37] <+killfrost11> no space magic
[4:26:39] <bear_breaker20> fart gas will getcha
[4:26:41] <AnacondaVirtue> Heal man
[4:26:43] <+Bonerlord911> eli are you refusing to heal out of some sort of honour system
[4:26:45] <mortelkilll> its not that far from human proportions, just slighly wider
[4:26:49] <Betofall> force shock wave, dammit ds2
[4:26:51] <+BlockingDisabled> Is he going for a no-heal run?
[4:27:13] <ChrisM341> SnuSnu sister
[4:27:14] <mortelkilll> to be fair if they were different human species, slighly different proportions would make sense
[4:27:42] <+askalta> manlet arms need buff
[4:27:48] <mortelkilll> but with aliens you expect stuff to look very different
[4:28:06] <mortelkilll> star wars too often doesnt go far enough, same with star trek
[4:28:10] <auhsojnala> @mortelkilll That's why I like wookies, ithorians, rodians, and other such various aliens over the zabraks, twi'leks, etc. They're much more properly *alien* that someone who's just human + horns, or human + head tentacles
[4:28:17] <mortelkilll> to be fair they need their aliens to be costumes for actors
[4:28:26] <BillieNoMates> Most alien species in series outside Star Control tend to be humanoid
[4:28:33] <BillieNoMates> Its a weird and boring species
[4:28:42] <mortelkilll> my favorite mass effect aliens are the pink jellyfish ,the tiny guys
[4:28:42] <Betofall> the thing with star wars is they have to be humanoid because they all use laser swords for some reason
[4:28:47] <auhsojnala> Mass Effect, outside of the Asari, has some nice alien designs imo
[4:28:47] <mortelkilll> and the elcors
[4:28:52] <ChrisM341> First Try
[4:28:53] <mortelkilll> a shame those 3 are never ennemies
[4:29:05] <%Samex_Comex> She is a Skywalker!
[4:29:06] <Aydarkzero> she's been disarmed Kappa
[4:29:07] <BillieNoMates> She's a masochist
[4:29:09] <mortelkilll> imagine fighting the volus and their bastard tiny selves
[4:29:15] <SuperVaderMan> eh she's already lost a foot, she's used to it
[4:29:18] <BillieNoMates> That suit will need to be dry cleaned
[4:29:24] <mortelkilll> or the huge elcors
[4:29:27] <Tiny_Axolotl> no pain?
[4:29:28] <Aydarkzero> wait is she actually missing a foot?
[4:29:32] <mortelkilll> or the hanar hi pin ktentacles
[4:29:33] <Aydarkzero> never noticed
[4:29:44] <SuperVaderMan> ye she's got a robot foot
[4:29:44] <Finchit> I have to say. this lady aint really threatening, idk why
[4:29:46] <mortelkilll> but the only aliens we fight in mass effects are humanoid
[4:29:47] <+rdark_ksu> yo nice orange lightsaber
[4:29:51] <+MurlinDurl> totally not dead
[4:29:53] <Cyral_Drive> torture good nice things bad
[4:29:55] <mortelkilll> and harvester
[4:29:57] <BillieNoMates> yes
[4:29:57] <+Bonerlord911> yeah all the inquisitors are tortured and mind broken
[4:30:00] <Tiny_Axolotl> can you force crush someone?
[4:30:06] <BillieNoMates> They are all shitty padawans
[4:30:14] <+Bonerlord911> she actually is dead now btw
[4:30:17] <rytisone> She's totally dead
[4:30:21] <mortelkilll> like i said , i understadn that i nstar wars and star trek, most aliens have to be done by human actors
[4:30:29] <+ratchetex> what
[4:30:30] <Betofall> it skin is plasticeel
[4:30:31] <mortelkilll> make it hard to have weird proportions
[4:30:34] <+Bonerlord911> nope you blasted her off the tree
[4:30:36] <+Bonerlord911> she is dead
[4:30:37] <BillieNoMates> you threw her through a bunch of sticks
[4:30:38] <$pennykettle_> Not dead "Defeated"
[4:30:38] <+dumbnamettv> Our noble hero can't possibly kill someone
[4:30:40] <BillieNoMates> Shes dead
[4:30:44] <+onlypuppet> What is death in Star Wars?
[4:30:46] <BillieNoMates> Jedi's real weakness
[4:30:52] <+Bonerlord911> yeah well we can't all be perfect
[4:30:58] <mortelkilll> or if the bird ate her
[4:31:02] <ChrisM341> She exited stage right. By smash rules, she's dead
[4:31:02] <Tempmael> hey its the plagueofgripes! cheers
[4:31:02] <Betofall> thats not the jedi way(sometimes)
[4:31:04] <+ratchetex> even a good stab
[4:31:05] <rytisone> but Disney
[4:31:05] <Aydarkzero> but thats not the Jedi way Kappa
[4:31:06] <%Samex_Comex> But your the hero
[4:31:06] <AnacondaVirtue> No, some of them were masters or full knights
[4:31:09] <mortelkilll> i vote for the bird ate her
[4:31:14] <mortelkilll> that would be gruesome
[4:31:15] <ittla> star wars is for kids haha
[4:31:17] <Aydarkzero> i'll get you next time Jedi!
[4:31:19] <auhsojnala> She's gonna come back a la Shadow of Mordor "You cut off my arm!"
[4:31:26] <Cyral_Drive> Falling off screen = absolutely not dead
[4:31:27] <AnacondaVirtue> You pushed her off, Plague
[4:31:38] <+Bonerlord911> maybe she comes back in the sequel :)
[4:31:44] <+tussletoes> Mickey Mouse Daigo parries your brutal kill. jumps out of a portal and bodyslams you
[4:31:44] <+killfrost11> ohhh no you killedd me how will i ever recover from falling from this silly high when i was pretty much float falling like 10 mins ago
[4:31:51] <mortelkilll> to be fair if it wasnt for tropes, falling from high usually is deadly
[4:32:02] <BillieNoMates> You mean like the Jedi Knight series?
[4:32:03] <mortelkilll> yeah more nuanced heroes and vilains
[4:32:08] <+bitstorm_> EEVVVVIIILL
[4:32:10] <AnacondaVirtue> ...did you watch the same cutscene as we did, Plague
[4:32:11] <Highwang> EVIL gets me FOLLOWERS
[4:32:13] <mortelkilll> no dark and light bs
[4:32:16] <Finchit> I mean its a story for kids who
[4:32:17] <Dao_Puppy> Thought the last one was doing that with the arms trade scene but it got forgot about pretty quick...
[4:32:22] <ChrisM341> Star wars is the battle of 2 religions?
[4:32:23] <+Bonerlord911> didn't they literally canonize a "light-side" which flies in the face of lucas's plan of "there is no light side, there is the force and the dark side which is like a cancer"
[4:32:24] <+rdark_ksu> Evil gives me the big peepee
[4:32:26] <+onlypuppet> Science fantasy vs scifi?
[4:32:49] <+eanscrale> Buh whuddabouda balance
[4:32:53] <Murphio_GS> Didn't they already have that in Kotor?
[4:32:57] <%Samex_Comex> Gold team rules!
[4:33:01] <Cyral_Drive> poncho man good red person bad
[4:33:04] <mortelkilll> balancer is getting rid of both side and have peopel instead of sects
[4:33:10] <Tiny_Axolotl> we alsoneed more weapon types other then light sabers
[4:33:20] <+onlypuppet> ??? sipsipSipsipblind
[4:33:22] <mortelkilll> really would be cool to have a non sith vilain
[4:33:25] <BillieNoMates> Poor bug
[4:33:38] <+ratchetex> yeah in ktor 2 they were like this is dumb, it's just the force
[4:33:56] <auhsojnala> Kreia in KotOR 2 kinda pushed the whole "don't give in to light or dark, extremes suck" thing
[4:34:13] <+killfrost11> or skywalkers can be done at last hopefully
[4:34:17] <Tiny_Axolotl> isn't star wars at a dead end as a series?
[4:34:18] <mortelkilll> non sith vilaisn would be a good start
[4:34:19] <+ratchetex> exactly she was pragmatic
[4:34:25] <mortelkilll> like an anti force person
[4:34:31] <mortelkilll> or an evil jedi
[4:34:39] <Dao_Puppy> ...and then skywalker's great great great grandchildren just happen to be jedis.
[4:34:40] <+Chronospasm> GET IN THE HIKE
[4:34:42] <+Chronospasm> hole*
[4:34:43] <+tussletoes> I honestly won't give a shit unless it's Republic Commando 2, and that'll never happen.
[4:34:45] <Betofall> plague goes to the ball pit
[4:34:53] <ChrisM341> That Storm trooper didn't hear shit
[4:35:06] <Dao_Puppy> Oh, skylwalker's cousin a jedi. His dog is a jedi...
[4:35:15] <mortelkilll> i really hate the heridity stuff
[4:35:18] <mortelkilll> too eugenic
[4:35:42] <mortelkilll> if jedi and sith lose all power they cant contro lthe force
[4:35:46] <AnacondaVirtue> "How dare this thing that wants to kill me try to kill me"
[4:35:48] <mortelkilll> so sort of balance
[4:35:49] <+Bonerlord911> Lucas's idea of "balance in the force" is no sith and no dark side
[4:35:52] <Murphio_GS> Even in the canon (now non canon) version of kotor 1 Revan isn't really fully the ideal jedi
[4:35:56] <+Bonerlord911> he viewed the dark side as what unbalances the force
[4:36:13] <srkAres> yeah, just keep the magical sword guys but get the pseudo-philosophy out there
[4:36:32] <+eanscrale> Honestly star wars has always had a huge problem with legacy that's really crippled its writers.
[4:36:33] <mortelkilll> havign a story about people caugh betwee nthe sith and jedi war could be cool
[4:36:42] <+Chronospasm> tbh my preferred interpretation of the Force was that it was more emotion against control
[4:37:04] <+Chronospasm> and that the dark side users were just those fuckers that always throw tantrums when things don't go their ways
[4:37:14] <mistermastergreg> @mortelkilll cough cough kotor2
[4:37:19] <+Chronospasm> but you don't exactly want to be an emotionless machine
[4:37:24] <mortelkilll> i heard of kotor 2
[4:37:28] <Betofall> how do you know he just doesn't huff paint?
[4:38:10] <mortelkilll> luke was a nice start since hes a jedi that learned the dark side
[4:38:12] <+MurlinDurl> he was pretty much a grey jedi in the old republic
[4:38:17] <mortelkilll> and was able to see the flaws of the light side mentality
[4:38:20] <ChrisM341> What's the Storm Trooper name from that Robot Chicken Star Wars special? I want a full movie about him
[4:38:24] <mortelkilll> but it kind of ended there
[4:38:25] <+Chronospasm> yeah didn't EU Luke learn darker stuff?
[4:38:34] <Murphio_GS> Yeah he died pretty stupidly
[4:38:41] <mortelkilll> even original trilogy luke went dark for a bit
[4:38:50] <+eanscrale> what I didn't know about that
[4:38:56] <+eanscrale> I only played kotor 1
[4:38:58] <ittla> the force is just a story telling tool. star wars used to use its details to tell stories instead of using stories to explain details.
[4:39:01] <aeravon> Jolee Bindo
[4:39:55] <Murphio_GS> Jolee and Kraia are two sides of the same coin in a way
[4:40:00] <+onlypuppet> I know people like that
[4:40:04] <mortelkilll> grey sith an interestign term
[4:40:21] <+CrimsonDio11> hi hello new but isnt everything to do with Kotor and the grey jedi and stuff no longer canon cause fuck disney?
[4:40:22] <RiverBirch> What then would be a Grey Force User?
[4:40:27] <srkAres> just meditating next to the toxic sewage pit, nice
[4:40:33] <+onlypuppet> Everyone wants their xmas bonus
[4:40:34] <Murphio_GS> Grumpy old man
[4:40:38] <RiverBirch> Or would it even be "Grey" at all
[4:40:38] <mortelkilll> luke kidn of was
[4:40:39] <auhsojnala> selfishness isn't dark side, going out of your way to be oppressive or murdering folks is dark side
[4:40:47] <RiverBirch> somebody who understands and practices both?
[4:40:52] <+MurlinDurl> always loved jolee and kreia, had them in both parties the whole game
[4:41:10] <+Chronospasm> that's these guys tho
[4:41:13] <mortelkilll> yeah, need what i call medium-large foes
[4:41:21] <mortelkilll> slighly beefy but stil leasy
[4:42:10] <mortelkilll> the empire also a very generic vilain
[4:42:16] <mortelkilll> wish there were more factions in star wars
[4:42:18] <Murphio_GS> Wasn't there a cartoon episode about a creature of the force that wasn't light or dark?
[4:42:21] <mortelkilll> the trade federation was cool
[4:42:41] <mortelkilll> but like is the empire the only warmonger in the galaxy?
[4:42:50] <%Samex_Comex> Run droid run!
[4:42:56] <BillieNoMates> Wait. DId you begin naruto running then?
[4:43:16] <ittla> donnie yen in rogue one was almost that
[4:43:20] <ittla> but he did nothing then died
[4:43:22] <Murphio_GS> Amen, eli
[4:43:23] <+MurlinDurl> man wish they would make a game on the ancient galaxy, like during the xim wars, but rip legends eu
[4:43:32] <mortelkilll> oh force aliens
[4:43:51] <mortelkilll> anthropocentrism at its peak
[4:43:53] <BillieNoMates> Some aliens in the EU were absolutely force incapable
[4:43:56] <Murphio_GS> The force within the galaxy I guess
[4:43:58] <Betofall> palpy's got reach
[4:44:00] <ittla> plague, the force is just space magic. trying to explain it just turns star wars into a god damned mess
[4:44:02] <BillieNoMates> So it might be that galaxy
[4:44:16] <bear_breaker20> everyone got goosebumps for that one sec
[4:44:37] <Skeletonmanners> Zippo
[4:44:38] <+onlypuppet> Ripples are weird
[4:44:39] <Cyral_Drive> zipper
[4:44:41] <Triblade1992> The Force is just space magic. Trying to explain the Force is always a bad idea. Otherwise we get the prequels.
[4:44:47] <RiverBirch> Zipper man
[4:44:52] <Apolonm> is like the micelian network Kappa
[4:44:53] <RiverBirch> sticky fingers
[4:44:56] <mortelkilll> dont need to explai nthe force , just show different usage of it
[4:45:01] <mortelkilll> different motives than evil and good
[4:45:11] <mortelkilll> different factiosn than rebels and empire
[4:45:15] <+Chronospasm> also, it's funny how it's perfectly okay for Jedi to manipulate minds and memories
[4:45:23] <mortelkilll> yeah tahts kind of fucked up
[4:45:25] <+CrimsonDio11> but what about the Wisps or whatever Lucas wanted the Force to be from or whatever
[4:45:25] <%Samex_Comex> The food that Ned's newt eats?
[4:45:27] <+Chronospasm> but lightning is a no-no
[4:45:28] <Murphio_GS> I like that you just kill space bees without even mentioning them
[4:45:38] <ittla> the force isnt scientific so you can only really use it emotionally in your story telling
[4:45:42] <ittla> and it's a good tool for that
[4:45:44] <Triblade1992> This is why I like the KOTOR 2 way of explaining the Force. Hell, even TLJ had a clipnotes version of this EXACT explaination
[4:46:10] <mortelkilll> yeah use ti to flesh out characters and motives
[4:46:24] <mortelkilll> have non jedi and non sith characters to develop the setting and stories
[4:46:26] <BillieNoMates> Eat your potatoes
[4:46:26] <Murphio_GS> It is, it's the best part of starwars
[4:46:30] <BillieNoMates> Blue potatoes
[4:46:37] <+onlypuppet> A lot of bees won’t sting if you’re gentle with them
[4:46:38] <mortelkilll> there barely been anti-force people
[4:46:44] <ChrisM341> Steak and slime
[4:46:47] <Betofall> mutha fuckin salt
[4:46:49] <RiverBirch> Why havent we flown away?
[4:46:59] <rytisone> moar salt
[4:47:00] <%Samex_Comex> Dinner with the family
[4:47:02] <ittla> this is so awkward
[4:47:03] <Triblade1992> Darth Vader
[4:47:03] <+eanscrale> That looks very unapitizing
[4:47:07] <Kiraklene> More salt please
[4:47:08] <$pennykettle_> the joke is that he has parkinsons
[4:47:15] <+MurlinDurl> was it vader PogChamp
[4:47:17] <RiverBirch> He has shaky hand syndome D:
[4:47:20] <RiverBirch> poor Alien.
[4:47:23] <ittla> he
[4:47:26] <mortelkilll> sto psalting you meat
[4:47:26] <BillieNoMates> He had a stroke
[4:47:26] <ittla> he's still shaking
[4:47:29] <+Mythicalbrit> why was he smiling the entire time
[4:47:30] <Murphio_GS> That alien's hair is way too giggly
[4:47:32] <+CrimsonDio11> why the fuck is his hair flowing in the wind
[4:47:35] <+BlockingDisabled> "Why can't we have just ONE DINNER without drama!"
[4:47:43] <bear_breaker20> PJSalt Kreygasm
[4:47:43] <%Samex_Comex> your report card came today
[4:48:15] <BillieNoMates> Its weird because its like a really shitty Kyle Katarn
[4:48:26] <RiverBirch> Was Kyle Katarn a good character?
[4:48:31] <Triblade1992> The Inquisitors are Ex Jedi so they have to either be killed by Padawans who are not brainwashed by the Old order or Sith Lords
[4:48:33] <+eanscrale> He's a dumb impressionable teen whadaya spect
[4:48:34] <BillieNoMates> He was decent enough
[4:48:49] <Betofall> restart the cult baby
[4:48:52] <mortelkilll> so they cant be kidnapped
[4:48:53] <Triblade1992> I think to destroy it?
[4:48:54] <mortelkilll> i guess
[4:48:55] <Skeletonmanners> kyle is entertaining in a cartoon kinda way
[4:49:05] <ittla> starrr warrrr
[4:49:14] <kiwicoffin> This was all Cere's idea, despite the man she respects jumping through flaming hoops to hide it
[4:49:27] <ittla> save the dreaaam
[4:49:37] <Triblade1992> Mara Jade had the right idea of being a good character with a good use of the Force and conflict.
[4:49:44] <RiverBirch> what the hell are these spaceships.
[4:49:49] <AnacondaVirtue> Rebuild the Order, allegedly
[4:49:52] <mortelkilll> totally gonan happen
[4:50:12] <mortelkilll> i still dont think much of you
[4:50:21] <Betofall> this devito alien is a hoot
[4:50:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:50:54] <Murphio_GS> Very eastern accent whatever it is
[4:51:03] <mistermastergreg> this alien fuck reminds me of Pat
[4:51:10] <+onlypuppet> He’s seen some stuff for sure
[4:51:25] <mortelkilll> at least hes not as boring as everyone else
[4:51:29] <mortelkilll> he has a personality
[4:51:30] <BillieNoMates> Its star wars
[4:51:31] <mortelkilll> hes just shitty
[4:51:39] <kiwicoffin> I'd describe it as undercooked
[4:51:39] <ittla> it exists
[4:51:43] <+rdark_ksu> uninspired?
[4:51:45] <ittla> the story does make things happen
[4:51:47] <Skeletonmanners> gray paste
[4:51:56] <Cyral_Drive> It's not remotely interesting
[4:52:01] <+eanscrale> It is starwars
[4:52:04] <canisdyluna> so.. mah?
[4:52:13] <ittla> there's definitely a sequence of events
[4:52:30] <rytisone> a story for mass audience
[4:52:57] <+averagelyre> The story were the friends we made along the way
[4:53:11] <Murphio_GS> aight
[4:53:12] <ittla> a very fun star war
[4:53:12] <kiwicoffin> @averagelyre Literally ture
[4:53:15] <kiwicoffin> *true
[4:53:31] <+rdark_ksu> reach is nice
[4:53:32] <Tempmael> ooh
[4:53:33] <aeravon> Good stream. It was a nice time, thank you Plague
[4:53:36] <Betofall> have you played other halos?
[4:53:43] <%Samex_Comex> Thanks for the stream
[4:53:48] <+MurlinDurl> HeyGuys
[4:53:50] <+CarlosEoM> later plague
[4:53:50] <Murphio_GS> you too Eli
[4:53:53] <mistermastergreg> ok bye plague, tell Pat he's a fuck
