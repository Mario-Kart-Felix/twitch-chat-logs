[0:00:42] <slix3431> First
[0:02:27] <+DocIrving> Man, dangle grandpas, dangit rambo, what else is there?
[0:02:29] <$Bigchill___> plague time
[0:02:31] <dp4k> dingdong roomba
[0:02:42] <Axza95> greetings fellow gamer
[0:03:03] <+Mekhet09> so i played one because of this stream. that dispair versus hope bullshit was bad. it was baby's first nihilism but otherwise it was fun.
[0:04:29] <%caramello_man> yeah spyro time, oh wait
[0:04:49] <+DocIrving> It does make you wonder why they didn't make them *fully* independent
[0:04:56] <franctastic_> hi everyone
[0:05:13] <+Mekhet09> i just thought they were pretentious in the classical sense of the word.
[0:05:21] <scott_greatest> Hi POG
[0:05:37] <YakumoYomi> I thought it was an upside-down egg
[0:05:40] <+DocIrving> You don't?
[0:05:48] <dp4k> i never really got pretentious from the game, more just kinda goofy dumb
[0:06:01] <haydenthygreat> this is my favorite chapter plaque of gripes
[0:06:12] <+Promessa_EX> back to the good game
[0:06:14] <+not_crabby> hes floating
[0:06:27] <cerazor01> @PlagueOfGripes You might like the series that Spike Chunsoft made before Danganronpa.  Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Zero Escape... that series also went to shit too.
[0:06:44] <cerazor01> Oh god his shadow is off.
[0:06:48] <YakumoYomi> Siddhi?
[0:07:08] <YakumoYomi> Bodhisatva?
[0:07:16] <dp4k> god he so lanky
[0:08:35] <kylecoolperson> HUGE
[0:10:03] <Oscarthemowerman> zaheer
[0:10:32] <cerazor01> lol the chat beat Plague to it
[0:10:41] <Futurecity10> oh boy, I needed this stream of plague bitching about this shit game whilst save scumming rolls in disco
[0:11:04] <dp4k> girls always keep you down
[0:11:15] <CozyCoat> free'd from horny jail
[0:11:34] <Oscarthemowerman> you can fly if you choose the way of the volcel
[0:11:39] <Futurecity10> The ancient paradox from stargate
[0:11:48] <cerazor01> isnt Korra herself an earthly attachment?
[0:11:56] <%Demirose41> We talking about how amon sucks ass
[0:11:56] <cerazor01> Since he wants to kick her ass.
[0:12:14] <+Amakuni1> Amakuni1 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:12:26] <+JailShmixRemix> If you have nothing then you have everything dekillMix
[0:12:36] <%Amakuni1> The 1 is silent
[0:13:06] <SuperVaderMan> Comfortable, relaxing anger
[0:13:10] <Oscarthemowerman> well those desires would be like money and material goods, not the desire to do good
[0:13:21] <+realm_forge> My earthly desires are pretty fuckin rad
[0:13:57] <Oscarthemowerman> it is weird that they include personal relationships on the same level as one of those desires tho
[0:14:21] <scott_greatest> the baby is the best unit of measure \
[0:14:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:14:56] <HiddenPorpoise> Factually the best season ending
[0:15:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Hooray!
[0:15:23] <KaiserMario> That's hilariously cruel
[0:15:53] <YakumoYomi> To be fair, I think Korra was poisoned prior to fighting Zaheer
[0:16:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> I'm starting to think Eli is a sadist
[0:16:24] <Oscarthemowerman> best enjoyed when head empty
[0:16:46] <haydenthygreat> I think the monomi minigame is fun
[0:17:30] <+pheblorganzardo> plug of grebs
[0:17:41] <cerazor01> FailFish
[0:17:43] <multimiles10> are these streams getting archived? I want to hear plague be grumpy about all these games

[0:18:13] <SuperVaderMan> Shame this lad for his no-ass
[0:18:33] <+vanareus> timing it during Paige's stream so she cant donate, nice
[0:19:00] <haydenthygreat> you can say how danganronpa is bad but the soundtrack is a banger
[0:19:23] <Oscarthemowerman> what's going on with the perspective and the train
[0:19:23] <SuperVaderMan> Can't have enough ice cream
[0:19:53] <Oscarthemowerman> yeah like a nerd version of gohan - oh wait

[0:20:32] <periphylla> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[0:20:40] <SuperVaderMan> Why no option to go get ice cream
[0:20:42] <+realm_forge> Vageta is the far superior father figure

[0:21:55] <SuperVaderMan> Anime skynet
[0:21:58] <$Bigchill___> I cant think of a worse spelling of a word then Colonel.

[0:28:54] <Sperbus> The Japanese one is REAL good
[0:29:06] <+sumrand0> Castration would help but its a bit extreme for a stream
[0:29:13] <Neoripo> If i remember correctly, Monokuma's VA in japanese is the Doraemon VA
[0:29:14] <inorwise> that marge sounded like a crack head

[0:30:15] <+mostdumbname> Paige would you actually die if you got on a rollercoaster
[0:30:15] <LVL1_Scumbag> I just don't trust carny construction/maintenance
[0:30:17] <+Carquar> @PeachSaliva Hey! What is the mic that you use?
[0:30:17] <PleaseCallMeSugar> roller coasters remind you how your body is just a sac of organs and blood

[0:31:05] <Agami23> i basically want to be a robot version of doc oct from spiderman
[0:31:06] <+Promessa_EX> i like the servitors that are a floating skull the print out of their mouth
[0:31:21] <cerazor01> I'd want to be the Turn A Gundam. Because it has a giant moustache.

[0:32:04] <PleaseCallMeSugar> "cleanse the outies" - plague

[0:32:12] <+SveriSageAdvice> its been phased out
[0:32:13] <Berendenn> thems the rules paige
[0:32:17] <PleaseCallMeSugar> actually some doctors literally ask which you want your child to have
[0:32:20] <RyuuAoi> Outtie was a mistake
[0:32:26] <@PeachSaliva> When I was a kid i thought all boys had outies
[0:32:36] <@PeachSaliva> jeez
[0:32:37] <+HawkGoggles2> Is and outtie a sign of a back cut?
[0:32:39] <+realm_forge> It’s literally pat in animatronic form

[0:33:03] <@PeachSaliva> his voice is nasal
[0:33:05] <@PeachSaliva> put it in your nose
[0:33:08] <+sumrand0> Society should enforce a midriff mandate to root out the evil
[0:33:09] <+Carquar> I remember always running away from a kid in my neighborhood who had an outie when he'd have his shirt off
[0:33:12] <+Carquar> It's awkward
[0:33:18] <Sperbus> Why does this entire soundtrack slap so hard
[0:33:21] <+Promessa_EX> gotta go louder and higher
[0:33:25] <SuperVaderMan> look at the tiny monokuma creeping in the top left
[0:33:38] <%heartlesshealer> nekomaru why

[1:54:17] <%heartlesshealer> the only reason water closet is a term that sticks around is because of the WC abbreviation popping up

[2:15:11] <TheMoenia> calling it now, the rooms moved
[2:15:16] <hcallahan_2211> The whole world moves
[2:15:28] <+lordericter> maybe the elevator just rotates 180 degrees
[2:15:32] <+cosmicleviathan18> ugh lord no
[2:15:32] <+lordericter> oh this is worse
[2:15:45] <+realm_forge> The doors open and they all get ducked out into space
[2:16:26] <+cosmicleviathan18> I want to go back screw grape house
[2:16:46] <TheMoenia> thats probably it
[2:16:59] <+cosmicleviathan18> that would be hilarious

[2:17:53] <SuperVaderMan> Akane just immediately rips someone in half right now LUL
[2:18:10] <+lordericter> wow this game is just forcing the murders

[2:18:28] <+Kungfuski> oh no the grape house
[2:18:30] <TheAntiNihilist> almost like there's some unknown motive...
[2:18:35] <+cosmicleviathan18> are they trying to force cannibalism
[2:19:13] <TheMoenia> all the juicy ones are dead
[2:19:13] <hcallahan_2211> You don't have to kill someone, just take an arm or leg and eat it
[2:19:20] <+lordericter> oh right Mechomaru is the only one who doesn't have a motive now
[2:19:25] <@TheDropOutDragon> That's a nice vtuber model on the left there Plague.

[2:22:36] <+lordericter> its a yakuza way of speaking
[2:22:48] <+lordericter> referring to non-gang/non cops as civilians
[2:22:54] <SuperVaderMan> Nekomaru having Phantom Pain of no ass

[2:23:32] <+realm_forge> He ejects hyper dense metallic alloy cubes at supersonic velocity
[2:24:26] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Btw can we just talk about how drill goatees are top tier
[2:24:55] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Hmm
[2:25:05] <Phob05> this feels like a detail that will come up last in the trial as a last second bombshell
[2:25:08] <+cosmicleviathan18> so why are we in fruit halls again?
[2:25:22] <TheMoenia> he even said that the wall are only colored because of the lights
[2:25:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @cosmicleviathan18 Because Monomi likes fruit, I guess
[2:25:35] <SuperVaderMan> It'll probably be like "oh they were murdered over here" but no they're the same location
[2:26:45] <Coystick> The setting is an awful wallpaper
[2:26:57] <A_CD_By_Thomas> It definitely likes to get as many details as it can with the final recap at the end of the trials
[2:27:32] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn
[2:28:04] <Coystick> She got that kuudere game on lock
[2:28:23] <TheAntiNihilist> oh hell yes. it's only a japan thing
[2:28:31] <sougoe> I've heard there's a pervasive "it can't be helped" attitude in japan
[2:28:37] <+HawkGoggles2> I mean, useless is a catchphrase so it might as well be a japan thing.
[2:29:19] <+realm_forge> It’s pointless to submit your resume when you just fill out the same info on the next Paige if the job application
[2:29:49] <+lordericter> all alone with Nagito...and his right hand
[2:29:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Kappa
[2:29:58] <+cosmicleviathan18> where's big bob lady?
[2:30:09] <BizzzarO00> I like to hate him.
[2:30:18] <+cosmicleviathan18> nvm LUL
[2:30:29] <TheAntiNihilist> "you don't trust me".  says man who only talks about how he wants to do a perfect murder
[2:30:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I feel bad for Nagito cuz it's clear he has very obvious problems, but sometimes his attitude just doesn't help
[2:30:48] <Oscarthemowerman> akane would 100% eat those hamsters
[2:30:49] <SuperVaderMan> You imbecile. You stupid moron. You fucking mongoloid.
[2:31:11] <TheMoenia> the hamster are just gonna eat their own young
[2:31:58] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Called it Kappa
[2:32:05] <arkv01> she has to eat all the eggs
[2:32:10] <Johnmaddened> :)
[2:32:11] <+cosmicleviathan18> oh jocatLewd
[2:32:12] <Coystick> I like that illustration a lot.
[2:32:17] <Coystick> go back
[2:32:26] <TheAntiNihilist> she hasn't been like this the whole game tho
[2:32:32] <SuperVaderMan> there's a point where a joke goes too far
[2:33:26] <sopdog21> Anime take character tropes to the next level
[2:34:24] <+FackinCrazy> i wonder if were going to get a robocop remake body horror scene with mechamaru
[2:34:44] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:35:19] <Oscarthemowerman> monocolor ptsd
[2:35:21] <Coystick> Oh good, back to grape rape
[2:35:27] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Kappa
[2:35:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> She's Monomi
[2:35:45] <Awesomewtf> Lol
[2:35:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> That's how
[2:36:26] <TheMoenia> even monokuma is more usefull than monomi
[2:36:53] <Oscarthemowerman> that's at least more funny than "is the exit food"
[2:37:06] <solracc25> monomi did it case closed
[2:37:24] <sosuke5> 3 feet?
[2:37:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> The anime's kinda make them around that little dog size, yeah.
[2:37:32] <TheAntiNihilist> 2-3 feet in the anime
[2:37:35] <Oscarthemowerman> 3 ft seems right
[2:38:27] <+cosmicleviathan18> don't cut yourself on that edge Gundham
[2:38:29] <solracc25> Like 3 ft. Depends on how monokuma wants it to be
[2:39:12] <fridayfuntime> please be my ASMR for tonight
[2:39:37] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Hot take maybe, but honestly Gundham's my favorite DR2 character. Chris Tergliafara's performance just carries him or me.
[2:39:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> *for
[2:40:11] <sosuke5> Chiaki has been Hall Wugging
[2:40:18] <TheAntiNihilist> well the map isn't exactly trustworthy
[2:40:25] <fridayfuntime> ugh this tower bs was really annoying
[2:40:39] <+realm_forge> Color me shocked
[2:40:40] <SuperVaderMan> Oh I thought the "same building" thing was gonna be more clever than that
[2:41:02] <Phob05> Why the life, why not just use the door?
[2:41:07] <Phob05> lift
[2:41:27] <A_CD_By_Thomas> FRUITS PogChamp
[2:41:40] <fridayfuntime> I hate the color scheme of this place
[2:41:46] <SuperVaderMan> Baby's first murder mystery
[2:41:49] <Phob05> babby's first death game
[2:42:01] <TheAntiNihilist> but ignore Japanese symbolism? BLASPHEMY
[2:42:01] <Oscarthemowerman> blues clues: can you tell me where the grape room is? Good job it's behind the grape door!
[2:42:52] <fridayfuntime> why did they choose green
[2:43:10] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Nothing else to do, so
[2:43:20] <fridayfuntime> purple would have worked so much better
[2:43:46] <paltar4> Damn i missed the stream
[2:44:06] <fridayfuntime> how old is akane?
[2:44:10] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah, a lot of the characters are great.
[2:44:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Design-wise, anyways
[2:44:20] <@PeachSaliva> Eli love her boobie
[2:44:49] <fridayfuntime> the green is so obnoxious I can't stand it why did they choose green grapes
[2:45:51] <+realm_forge> P,ague literally figured out the level gimmick an hour ago lol
[2:45:51] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @PlagueOfGripes Do you feel like Asahina did Akane's tropes better or nah? I know they're not one-to-one copies, but they have a lot of overlap
[2:46:11] <TheMoenia> cant they just push over one of the pillars?
[2:46:19] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah
[2:46:54] <fridayfuntime> that's robo-phobic
[2:47:42] <fridayfuntime> check your pet
[2:47:58] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Seems like it, yeah
[2:48:23] <+Promessa_EX> i see that you hit max coins.
[2:48:44] <Coystick> or her weirdo studded tie
[2:48:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Bun
[2:49:10] <Dlent_> Does this not count as littering?
[2:49:56] <TheAntiNihilist> stop with your fetish Plague
[2:50:16] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Dlent_ I feel that would imply more leaving it in the ocean or in the grass, not just on the floor
[2:50:24] <+realm_forge> The robot could burn the shut fir fuel. Everybody wins!
[2:50:25] <+ratchetex> that is how those fetishes start
[2:50:26] <TheAntiNihilist> ....
[2:50:26] <Oscarthemowerman> talk about it a lot for it not being your fetish
[2:51:03] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah LUL
[2:53:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah, there are times when DR feels like it plays its hand too obviously, and then takes way too long for the cast to catch it.
[2:53:44] <rib64> issac asimov gets cock blocked
[2:54:19] <+Promessa_EX> .. it’s the only way
[2:55:14] <LordSDB> Wait what are you teaching this sweet himbo?

[2:56:39] <%Sweetangy021> Aren't the laws usually used in stories to say they would never work?
[2:56:40] <solracc25> You can program it to do  whatever
[2:56:43] <LordSDB> I am in the wrong chat
[2:56:56] <arkv01> time to bust out flux, plague :(
[2:57:11] <paltar4> Plague is adorable what do you mean @lordsdb
[2:57:21] <TheAntiNihilist> maybe she was sheltered and also watched the movie I, robot
[2:57:21] <LordSDB> That is true Plague is adraoble
[2:57:30] <paltar4> golden64Brazil golden64Brazil
[2:57:49] <arkv01> now would be a good time to backhand gundham

[2:58:37] <A_CD_By_Thomas> LUL
[2:58:42] <rib64> how long is that dude's neck?
[2:58:43] <arkv01> sonia lets no good deeds go unrewarded :)
[2:59:52] <TheAntiNihilist> way more believable tho
[2:59:57] <+realm_forge> Holy shit I was on the edge of my seat since plague figured his out an hour ago
[3:01:07] <+Promessa_EX> is this better or worse than them not having evidence in the last case

[3:04:53] <+realm_forge> Just expose them to Twitter for 48 hours
[3:05:03] <TheAntiNihilist> who is supposed to be dumber, Sonia or Akane?
[3:05:21] <+MisterRockett> There's a reason Monokuma wants to leave less to chance here.
[3:05:25] <SockPuppetNinja> Let's eat the robot
[3:05:45] <QuietSandshrew> They All Belong to Me
[3:05:49] <SockPuppetNinja> I'd die first

[3:06:39] <vladtet909> I'd trust no one, and be on guard at all times. I'd also try to kill if threatened.
[3:06:41] <Lelfro> wouldn't it take just wait until everyone is asleep?
[3:06:44] <4213dead> But Plague, that's a smart idea!
[3:06:47] <SockPuppetNinja> I can't believe they made Among Us into an anime
[3:06:53] <QuietSandshrew> Actually were gunna spilt up, i need time to setup my Schemes

[3:07:35] <TheAntiNihilist> I just realized something, in the entirety of the series I don't think a murder was ever committed in self-defense. which is VERY weird

[3:51:41] <QuietSandshrew> After i learn the technique to make him shit his pants
[3:51:47] <Explodincatz> @kiriagi862 reddit helped me and I threw the node outside of the US to Germany and it works now

[3:56:05] <SoFarFetched> geefThink I mean I guess? Since the first game had Sakura kill herself.
[3:56:06] <paltar4> Doesn’t monokuma have a despair fetish he probably would still like suicides
[3:56:18] <SoFarFetched> But Im sure monokuma would somehow mess with the case to make it easier

[4:09:16] <solracc25> drink that water
[4:09:21] <Lelfro> there's also the bathrooms, so there's water there

[4:10:35] <QuietSandshrew> That sounds Crazy
[4:10:47] <arkv01> yeah definitely some kind of electrolyte supplement otherwise its a ticket to organ and brain damage
[4:10:52] <vladtet909> Eat Fat Byakuya

[4:15:20] <arkv01> barely any body fat
[4:15:30] <SoFarFetched> Yeah they do eat meals in smaller portions.
[4:15:38] <Lelfro> maybe their internal clocks are so bad, 10 days have passed?
[4:15:42] <+spongeofmystery> You can eat wood, right?
[4:15:56] <paltar4> You can eat leather
[4:15:57] <arkv01> ohhh... shit that wasn't part of the scenario ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[4:16:04] <SoFarFetched> Or if someone had a heart condition and suddenly seeing a dead body caused them to have a heart attack and die.
[4:16:30] <SoFarFetched> then suddenly "second" body during a murder
[4:16:44] <QuietSandshrew> GAMING
[4:16:52] <SoFarFetched> you now have to go into his medical history on why they had the heart attack
[4:16:54] <TheMoenia> was monokuma cruising for dudes?
[4:17:06] <SuperVaderMan> You can honestly skip these theater sections and not miss anything of value
[4:17:38] <QuietSandshrew> Hes Cruising For A Bruising
[4:18:17] <TheMoenia> they are behaving like they have been here for weeks

[4:19:15] <QuietSandshrew> In the arms of the angels
[4:19:29] <SoFarFetched> Japan has a lot of terms for *very* specific things
[4:19:42] <$Rezca> you die at your desk, you die a saint
[4:19:45] <SoFarFetched> Like I think they have one  for overworking yourself to death too.
[4:19:55] <QuietSandshrew> AMAZING
[4:20:07] <untrustful> humans = lots of fat
[4:20:08] <arkv01> not enough Kappa
[4:20:15] <+spongeofmystery> @SoFarFetched I'd remind you that English has a specific term for tricking people into watching a Rick Astley music video
[4:20:16] <Pawllo0o> hajime is a snacc
[4:20:28] <QuietSandshrew> YEA
[4:20:30] <SoFarFetched> @spongeofmystery this sounds sus geefThink

[4:20:41] <Eger007> sure go ahead
[4:20:43] <TheMoenia> chocolate cake from germany
[4:20:53] <arkv01> I'd gladly eat ass but only with consent InuyoFace
[4:20:54] <sopdog21> She wants your Makango
[4:20:55] <QuietSandshrew> jaboodyPray
[4:20:58] <SoFarFetched> also I remembered the term for overworking yourself to death is Karoshi.
[4:21:02] <+not_crabby> i wonder how much nutrients cum has
[4:21:09] <+spongeofmystery> It's like "zakkertorte"
[4:21:20] <QuietSandshrew> I WAS GUNNA FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LIGHT
[4:21:24] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, who could've seen this coming, oh nooooooo

[4:21:47] <bleugh> dong romp
[4:21:52] <SuperVaderMan> I can't believe nekomura shit himself to death, just like Plague's pet
[4:22:11] <arkv01> the shit just built up so much pressure and shot his head right off
[4:22:20] <arkv01> eat your greens kids
[4:22:27] <SuperVaderMan> Monokuma should've built him an ass to shit with
[4:22:35] <QuietSandshrew> Damn hes dead tho

[4:23:36] <+not_crabby> but it just seems like it was hamster man
[4:23:37] <%KgKid51> 👷🏽♀️
[4:23:39] <SoFarFetched> monokuma probably farted it out
[4:23:40] <A_CD_By_Thomas> But why would he go to all the trouble of making it look like a murder if that could lead them to getting executed in the trial?
[4:23:49] <Explodincatz> he got banned from life
[4:23:57] <+spongeofmystery> This is like the robot version of auto-erotic asphyxiation
[4:24:07] <SuperVaderMan> Aw dang, the one who died is the only one we can't eat
