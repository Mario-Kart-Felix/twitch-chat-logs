[0:01:28] <%Rezca> Time to get the beer ready
[0:01:29] <Triblade1992> I'm playing FF7R right now and the game is pretty good remake. isn't a 1 to 1 game of the oirignal. If I wanted to play FF7, then I would play FF7
[0:02:43] <+JantDarvus> i saw a dog i want more dog
[0:03:40] <ralphwiggum16> hi plague
[0:04:20] <+Dresdran> So what did I miss last time?
[0:04:47] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, do you think about goblins ever?
[0:04:56] <ralphwiggum16> 'Cuz i think i might have a medical condition.
[0:05:10] <%Samex_Comex> It's you!?
[0:05:34] <ralphwiggum16> aw you don't have to be on cam, buddy!
[0:05:50] <%Samex_Comex> He looks like Hope
[0:05:52] <dukenux> who? Cloud?
[0:06:01] <+Dresdran> Brachy?
[0:06:03] <dukenux> InCase Kreygasm
[0:06:12] <%Samex_Comex> I think that's the name of the kid from 13?
[0:06:13] <DrFaustMD> she punch
[0:06:14] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, why do you respond to me?
[0:06:19] <+Dresdran> Them too.
[0:06:55] <ralphwiggum16> Tifa is a little too hot in this game.
[0:07:00] <ralphwiggum16> but i suppose everyone is.
[0:07:30] <Rodnock> They nerfed her boobs from the first game though it looks like
[0:07:32] <dukenux> Everyones hot, and yet they all yearn for Cloud's p
[0:07:50] <%Samex_Comex> Lol they way she just starts wailing on the monster
[0:07:56] <+Dresdran> No one can resist his hair spikes.
[0:08:05] <Skeletonmanners> hope you have a good time with spiky hair adventures
[0:08:18] <ralphwiggum16> they kinda niered this up
[0:08:28] <ralphwiggum16> which is really really wierd the more i think about it.
[0:08:31] <dukenux> i love how NPCs look like normal people
[0:08:39] <%PlebianNoob> maybe he runs based on health.
[0:08:55] <TomFrank> Tifa Kreygasm
[0:08:55] <dukenux> and main characters are anime con cosplayers
[0:09:08] <dukenux> Tifas already hot as it is
[0:09:11] <+Dresdran> She should have some more honing abilities.
[0:09:12] <+PleasantLee> yeah this guy is abit tough
[0:09:27] <%Samex_Comex> Shake it off Tifa
[0:09:31] <dukenux> although yes, id appreciate mire beef
[0:09:37] <+PleasantLee> wish the gameover was the film reel
[0:09:42] <+TaterBurglar> Oh I thought FF7 was a turn based game
[0:09:52] <+Dresdran> I mean, the original could be.
[0:10:06] <+PleasantLee> front load annoyance
[0:10:09] <@dcn2049> Do it again
[0:10:14] <ralphwiggum16> you don't annoy us plague, we love you
[0:10:24] <ralphwiggum16> you're our hero
[0:10:26] <+TaterBurglar> front load and back load annoyance
[0:10:32] <$daveronald> your looking extra sexy today
[0:11:09] <%Samex_Comex> Where is the moon?
[0:11:31] <@dcn2049> One way to find out
[0:11:58] <+PleasantLee> if you want to get the biker boy trophy you cant retry from last battle, you have to redo the whole bike part
[0:12:09] <ralphwiggum16> Plague stop it, we think you're the coolest
[0:12:56] <ozuma35> Hi, Plague. Just a quick question. Have Woolie or Pat not invited you onto the podcast? I miss having you on it.
[0:13:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:13:37] <+PleasantLee> if you click in R3 you'll look on
[0:13:40] <+PleasantLee> lock on*
[0:13:48] <ralphwiggum16> Thoughts on similarities to Automata?
[0:14:20] <%Samex_Comex> Ultra combo!
[0:14:42] <SunsetJack> You tried experimenting on the camera settings? I think I saw that you can zoom out or something.
[0:14:47] <+PleasantLee> hes a pretty princess
[0:15:35] <%PlebianNoob> so are there different combos that happen when you swap characters or is it just whoever you feel like attacking with at that moment?
[0:15:37] <@dcn2049> Neir Android Waifu
[0:15:45] <cap_bon> I remember FF7 being a huge ass game does this really have the same amount as content
[0:15:49] <%Samex_Comex> She has a big butt
[0:16:02] <TheGuesty> @Samex_Comex THE big butt
[0:17:29] <+PleasantLee> BOX ATTACK!
[0:17:50] <ralphwiggum16> he's such a rascal, that cloud
[0:17:54] <+PleasantLee> you use ALOT of potions
[0:18:32] <cap_bon> how much hp does this thing have
[0:18:35] <+PleasantLee> you have to be really aggresive too. cant use items without atb stocked
[0:18:38] <+PleasantLee> so running doesnt work
[0:19:15] <TheWe4pon> damn i missed 20 min
[0:19:32] <Ace_Kuper> So is this just a short stream or Plague just forgot to tweet about this happening?
[0:19:54] <+PleasantLee> auto-cure has saved me afew times
[0:20:46] <Triblade1992> Auto-cure is something taken out of FF13 and FF15. It gets rid of the hassle of "Go into the screen, find the cure item/spell, and keep using it constantly".
[0:20:50] <Triblade1992> It can get really annoying
[0:22:11] <Triblade1992> 80 hours are most likely people tryinig to platinum it
[0:22:38] <+nooseygoosey> those dead eyes
[0:22:39] <+PleasantLee> those 2 guards are adorable
[0:22:43] <TheWe4pon> what did she say?
[0:22:53] <+PleasantLee> I hope they eventually go on a date
[0:23:27] <cap_bon> The orb
[0:23:31] <+PleasantLee> materia in the hand is like the size of a baseball
[0:23:46] <TheWe4pon> more like softball
[0:23:48] <ralphwiggum16> plague has magic powers?
[0:24:23] <Triblade1992> I thought Jesse gave you a cure material that was that small Plague?
[0:24:28] <+PleasantLee> well they are crystalised liquid, maybe they get smaller
[0:24:29] <Triblade1992> Because it looked pretty small to me
[0:24:32] <+nooseygoosey> pokeball rules
[0:24:50] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes Did you forget to tweet about the stream happening or is it just twitch not sending the auto-tweet?
[0:25:33] <+PleasantLee> did clouds motel room door's texture fail to load properly for anyone else? everytime I go there it looks like PS1
[0:26:10] <cap_bon> its not truely a ps1 texture unless it vibrates
[0:26:11] <+nooseygoosey> is this some space exploration game menu?
[0:26:17] <+PleasantLee> animation takes too long. hard to tell what you're hovering over, shit moves and gets confusing
[0:26:25] <+Dresdran> I looked away and got super confused.
[0:26:26] <Ace_Kuper> people said that this menu is similar to FF13, but i'm not sure.
[0:26:36] <Triblade1992> Why does this look like a terrible version of the Crystarium from FF13? The Crystarium at least LINKED THE DAME CRYSTAL BIT
[0:26:40] <+PleasantLee> you get more cores the more it levels
[0:26:41] <Triblade1992> Man that looks terrible
[0:26:43] <+Dresdran> Now THIS is style over substance.
[0:26:54] <cap_bon> what am I looking at? some kind of skill maze?
[0:27:06] <Triblade1992> And it wasn't pitch black on the behind
[0:27:10] <+Dresdran> The Path of Exile skill map is more intuitive than this.
[0:28:17] <+nooseygoosey> i only see one from 18 hours ago on your twitter
[0:28:40] <+PleasantLee> I wouldnt dislike it if the menu for it was better
[0:28:49] <JonesMcFly> Looks like ffX, right?
[0:28:55] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes Huh, strange the last tweet it shows for me is 18 hours ago.
[0:29:22] <Triblade1992> Yeah, why did they make the backdrop black? The backdrop in FF13 is white and the crystals were connected. It felt good.
[0:29:29] <+PleasantLee> I think its supposed to remind us of bugenhagens model solar system
[0:29:29] <Triblade1992> This looks BAAAAAD
[0:30:12] <+PleasantLee> when you get a new weapon for a character equip it right away, get its skill then hang it up in the cupboard and go back to the big number go up
[0:31:26] <+silvery_cricket> FF7R feels like a series where a director will "leave" and someone else will take over and try and fix everything.
[0:31:47] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes That's a pretty good stream layout
[0:31:52] <%laserbeaming> Is your childhood dead already?
[0:32:21] <+silvery_cricket> I hate this Menu it is so not Final Fantasy
[0:32:30] <+silvery_cricket> especially this is very reliant on nostalgia
[0:32:32] <+PleasantLee> if you had enough SP I wish it would let your buy out cores wholesale
[0:32:45] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes I just decided to ask about the tweet, since i remember that Journey stream that was muted and no one said anything for hours.
[0:32:53] <Kirby_Sauce> ff7 bad
[0:33:34] <overkrustice> What up bois, how we liking the game
[0:33:45] <+PleasantLee> I think a bunch of enemies coming up are weak to ice
[0:33:56] <Kirby_Sauce> CHACKRA materoa?
[0:34:02] <+silvery_cricket> Man look at all that nice bright cheerful sunlight when the plater is fully built over this area.
[0:34:04] <+TQuick101> I certainly can't read it
[0:34:08] <cap_bon> I didnt know chat was even on screen
[0:34:08] <+Punishedkaiger> I see us, up in the shame corner
[0:34:11] <SuperVaderMan> Put chat directly over your face
[0:34:12] <Kirby_Sauce> time to naruto
[0:34:16] <+LiteralBear> didnt even notice it
[0:34:17] <+silvery_cricket> and the sky is blotted out by horrible smog
[0:34:30] <+silvery_cricket> ha ha lighting engine shown off even though it makes no sense
[0:34:37] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:34:49] <+PleasantLee> but now it covers Aeris
[0:35:05] <+PleasantLee> hehe 420
[0:35:12] <%laserbeaming> Has Gackt made a cameo yet? Kappa
[0:35:18] <JonesMcFly> nice
[0:35:20] <overkrustice> My only gripe about this game is them locking the hard mode. other than that 7 out of 5
[0:35:45] <+silvery_cricket> borderline?
[0:35:45] <SuperVaderMan> aw shucks
[0:35:47] <%laserbeaming> share the porn plague
[0:36:06] <overkrustice> Nipple band aids huh. I got all the info I need
[0:36:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:36:30] <bordingcrazy> Walked in
[0:36:40] <+PleasantLee> your honour it wasnt "porn" it was very close to being porn
[0:36:43] <+silvery_cricket> Man crazy how all this nice sunlight gets through that dense sky blotting fog.
[0:36:49] <bordingcrazy> First thing i hear is nipple band aids
[0:36:51] <+silvery_cricket> smog*
[0:36:56] <+PleasantLee> I was thinking the same thing about her boots earlier
[0:37:03] <+TQuick101> I mean I don't see that but okay
[0:37:04] <+PleasantLee> they look too big and soft
[0:37:10] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes Her last name is Caligula
[0:37:13] <overkrustice> Silly sure? Looks good though.
[0:37:21] <JonesMcFly> go on...
[0:37:32] <Triblade1992> well that's what happens when you remake a 20 year old game Plague
[0:37:34] <bazz_tv> hi Plague, never took you for the live cam type of streamer
[0:37:39] <+PleasantLee> I do think they ruined her design a fair bit, tits aside
[0:37:44] <+silvery_cricket> Looks better than all the original character designs.
[0:38:15] <bazz_tv> who made you do it then?
[0:38:19] <SuperVaderMan> Plague needs all the humanization he can get
[0:38:22] <TheWe4pon> plague is human?
[0:38:28] <%laserbeaming> A likeable asshole though
[0:38:28] <arran_throttle> come on Plague we know that you are not a human
[0:38:35] <+LiteralBear> beast man was harrier
[0:38:42] <+HawkGoggles2> Plague is people too. Kappa
[0:38:44] <+PleasantLee> you can buy music from some of these vending machines
[0:38:52] <+PleasantLee> and sitting on the blue bench heals
[0:38:59] <Spartanxp117> @plagueofgripes you remind me of Kain from command and conquer
[0:39:03] <+PleasantLee> and you get to look at cloud looking like goober
[0:39:12] <Triblade1992> I prefer compelling, fascinating and believable when also looking at personality. I am not a fan of "likeable, relatable, sympathetic"
[0:40:21] <SuperVaderMan> This is the bird creature enclosure
[0:40:34] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[0:40:36] <+PleasantLee> ADVENT
[0:40:38] <+PleasantLee> CHILDREN
[0:40:42] <JonesMcFly> wow that lool
[0:40:44] <+nooseygoosey> these kinds of reactions are why cam is fun
[0:40:44] <cap_bon> Anime fighter time
[0:40:45] <%laserbeaming> This is Dissidia levels of dumb sky fights
[0:40:46] <@Nightbot> @law240 -> You wanna dance? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:40:48] <bazz_tv> liking the game so far? Oney has been complaining about it
[0:40:49] <%PlebianNoob> What? I was tabbed out.
[0:40:50] <vonmaultke> ANIME
[0:40:50] <+HawkGoggles2> The KH is coming out.
[0:40:54] <JonesMcFly> wow that looks bad
[0:41:01] <+PleasantLee> also breaks the context of the game. "oh no a waist high fence, gotta go back"
[0:41:02] <Arth__> Tifa fanart when?
[0:41:04] <vonmaultke> What the fuck is gravity?
[0:41:04] <BillieNoMates> Can't wait till later
[0:41:18] <kingra> Oh boy. You will HATE what happens later
[0:41:24] <law240> But it's okay in the orignal Tifa was power bomding tanks
[0:41:27] <$Rivalshotzgp> Did you see the final battle spoilers?
[0:41:34] <arran_throttle> don't think about it, its anime, dont you think as a reasonable aduilt
[0:41:39] <+PleasantLee> fighting flyers is pretty shit with no range party member
[0:41:39] <law240> use your magic
[0:41:48] <bazz_tv> maybe if it was more DMC like
[0:41:51] <@dcn2049> How does this feel?
[0:41:54] <+silvery_cricket> Welcome to a Nomura game
[0:42:03] <+PleasantLee> use your triple slash
[0:42:07] <+silvery_cricket> where everything is overdesigned and feels bad
[0:42:07] <SuperVaderMan> Cool camera
[0:42:12] <%PlebianNoob> I can imagine. You have to jump to hit it but if you miss the imputs just have you attacking in place.
[0:42:34] <law240> Assess it?
[0:42:38] <@dcn2049> The power of "gun" looks appealing now
[0:42:42] <+PleasantLee> hahahaah
[0:42:45] <cap_bon> Its like im watching Magneto/doom in Marvel vs Capcom 3
[0:42:47] <arran_throttle> LUL
[0:42:47] <Triblade1992> I like how FF7R combat is FF13 combat meets Kingdom Hearts
[0:42:48] <+PleasantLee> its body landed on the roof
[0:42:54] <+Dresdran> Should Tifa have been designed as a heat-seeking missile?
[0:43:03] <law240> well if you Assessed it
[0:43:06] <+Dresdran> You just can't escape from her.
[0:43:09] <bazz_tv> where is up trick when you need it?
[0:43:14] <+PleasantLee> could with a gun
[0:43:15] <+Dresdran> But she doesn't hit super hard.
[0:43:16] <+PleasantLee> buster gun
[0:43:26] <+nooseygoosey> hopefully this isnt one of those special fights where they introduce monster that soon becomes regular enemy
[0:43:29] <arran_throttle> mod bigger titts!
[0:43:33] <+Dresdran> So an overhaul mod?
[0:43:34] <+Joebuzzy> does the game feel weird?
[0:43:39] <vonmaultke> Remove all the spoiler visions
[0:43:43] <bazz_tv> Dante laughs in swordtrickswordguntrick....
[0:43:50] <@dcn2049> "Nomura Delete"
[0:44:04] <Triblade1992> Eh, Remakes aren't suppose to be a 1 to 1 recreation of the original. Remakes aren't a replacement to the original
[0:44:29] <bazz_tv> man look at this not anime looking lady
[0:44:31] <@dcn2049> They're not supposed to be dogshit in several places either
[0:44:36] <TheWe4pon> man fuck this bitch
[0:44:43] <arran_throttle> what?
[0:44:45] <$daveronald> why is shy talking so loud
[0:44:55] <+Dresdran> Oh sure they are.
[0:44:56] <cap_bon> She says infront of shinra guards
[0:45:11] <%laserbeaming> owo
[0:45:12] <+PleasantLee> I really like clouds armoured glvoe
[0:45:17] <vonmaultke> Remaster is cleaning up the original code and updating it. Remake is to remake its code and make improvements upon the original while remaining to to it
[0:45:23] <vonmaultke> This does neither
[0:45:32] <@dcn2049> haha
[0:45:33] <vonmaultke> True*
[0:45:43] <+PleasantLee> you can check your sidequests on the map menu
[0:46:00] <bazz_tv> was this place so getto like in the original?
[0:46:05] <JonesMcFly> GILF
[0:46:21] <Triblade1992> Eh, an FF7 remake would have to expand on things like Midgar Section big time. The game would have to become what Motomu Toriyama almost turned the original game into: "Midagar Section: The Game"
[0:46:21] <cap_bon> that texture streaming is Shinras doing
[0:46:21] <%PlebianNoob> Wait the buster sword can change or is that a completely different sword?
[0:46:37] <+silvery_cricket> Look at the woman covered in jewelry in this CRIME SLUM
[0:46:38] <TheWe4pon> shes saying FUCK ALREADY
[0:46:38] <+Dresdran> He is as confused as you are, Plague.
[0:46:57] <+HawkGoggles2> It takes all of one day for Could to big the biggest rep of the slums.
[0:47:01] <bazz_tv> she wants a grandson
[0:47:13] <Triblade1992> yes
[0:47:18] <+PleasantLee> hey Cloud, this water filter is giving me trouble, can you help?
[0:47:22] <TheWe4pon> they were water filters
[0:47:23] <sosuke5> EGG
[0:47:29] <Triblade1992> that's what a slum is Plague
[0:47:46] <+logoth_> e g g
[0:47:48] <LordoftheBadgers> psykenWave
[0:47:52] <%caramello_man> man i would love to live in a baseball stadium
[0:47:58] <bazz_tv> wouldn't air quality be worse the higher you are?
[0:48:01] <BillieNoMates> Tifa definitely would eat all the eggs without bitching
[0:48:03] <+PleasantLee> sleep here is just heal
[0:48:06] <BillieNoMates> Got to get those lean gains
[0:48:17] <law240> check your stink
[0:48:23] <+PleasantLee> there is another prompt later to go to the next day
[0:48:32] <+PleasantLee> the game is very clear about this stuff
[0:48:34] <rdddy> will there be more mount&blade gameplay in the future?
[0:48:35] <law240> look at your sink
[0:48:54] <law240> the sink
[0:48:55] <bazz_tv> is Pat liking this game? or has activated some mind goblins?
[0:48:56] <+PleasantLee> Eli-chan trusted me PogChamp
[0:49:11] <+PleasantLee> its a water filter
[0:49:16] <+Dresdran> Water filter.
[0:49:24] <BillieNoMates> Its a water filter
[0:49:29] <TheWe4pon> they are water filters
[0:49:36] <BillieNoMates> They mention it the moment you get there
[0:49:38] <Triblade1992> water filter
[0:49:44] <BillieNoMates> The water tastes like eggy farts
[0:49:47] <+PleasantLee> look at her shit
[0:49:54] <oshkeet41> in fairness a good filter will make the water less eggu smelling too
[0:50:02] <+PleasantLee> pirated dvds
[0:50:19] <oshkeet41> bootleg CDs, cause she'd by those from a dodgy seller. thats a nice touch.
[0:50:19] <+PleasantLee> I swear that disc says "Darude Sandstorm"
[0:50:24] <rdddy> 2girls1cup
[0:50:27] <BillieNoMates> Pirated CDs for rebellion against Shinra
[0:50:29] <+PleasantLee> 2/4
[0:50:44] <conchubar11> because even Eco Terrorism needs a soundtrack for hype
[0:50:52] <Tgach> 'Documentation 2/4' ?
[0:51:02] <+PleasantLee> now tell her to put her best fishnets on
[0:51:03] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[0:51:08] <@dcn2049> are her eyes red?
[0:51:09] <BillieNoMates> Just wait for Jessie and her shit later
[0:51:12] <%laserbeaming> Tifa, your eyes are fucking huge
[0:51:14] <+HawkGoggles2> She wants to fuck. She's doing her best.
[0:51:15] <rdddy> why are her titts so big
[0:51:35] <+Dresdran> LIES.
[0:51:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> why not?
[0:51:36] <%PlebianNoob> LIES
[0:51:41] <jakekrow> cause they were bigger and they toned them down
[0:51:41] <oshkeet41> she's being extra bubbly cause she want clud to open up
[0:51:41] <TheWe4pon> LIES
[0:51:42] <bazz_tv> those are some big beeferonies
[0:51:45] <+PleasantLee> yeah, some things are about money
[0:51:46] <SuperVaderMan> Unless we're talking about Jessie, who is extremely horny all the time
[0:51:51] <%laserbeaming> Tell that to Freud
[0:52:04] <%PlebianNoob> Look at her tits and tell me it's not about sex
[0:52:11] <law240> MATURE pick MATURE
[0:52:19] <BillieNoMates> SHUT UP TIFA
[0:52:22] <BillieNoMates> I HAVE KILLED PEOPLE
[0:52:34] <+Dresdran> Cloud immediately puts on a dress.
[0:52:39] <rdddy> lets trap up and hit the town
[0:52:43] <+Dresdran> Just, "Deal."
[0:52:49] <bazz_tv> oh boy
[0:52:56] <LunarRemix> Mature is classic blue FYI
[0:53:02] <law240> MATURE
[0:53:03] <LunarRemix> Or puple, whatever
[0:53:05] <BillieNoMates> Women also don't like to hear what you want them to wear
[0:53:12] <TheWe4pon> heres the dresses
[0:53:14] <BillieNoMates> They want to hear what she wants to wear
[0:53:14] <+PleasantLee> what would you say to her Eli?
[0:53:15] <TheWe4pon> https://i.imgur.com/VyUo0iw.png
[0:53:33] <+PleasantLee> "shut up and put clothes on bitch"
[0:53:33] <+HawkGoggles2> It's Japan, I'd go with mature. They love that.
[0:53:39] <%laserbeaming> It should probably say Classy instead of mature
[0:53:39] <rdddy> here are 3 wrong answers im gonna be pissed either way, so pick one already
[0:53:45] <manwithaxe> she needs to go even sportier
[0:53:52] <BillieNoMates> "Im wearing my SOLDIER get up"
[0:53:55] <BillieNoMates> "Fuck you"
[0:53:59] <manwithaxe> 2 pairs of spats
[0:54:04] <SuperVaderMan> What IS cloud wearing btw? Like a sleeveless turtleneck? LUL
[0:54:20] <oshkeet41> Cloud's lingering dread of Being Known #relatable
[0:54:20] <BillieNoMates> Tifa, arent you meant to be delivering water filters atm?
[0:54:26] <+Dresdran> Cloud runs home desperately trying to find another identical uniform.
[0:54:30] <jakekrow> is tifa a female simp?
[0:54:34] <LunarRemix> That's one change I'd be on board.
[0:54:35] <BillieNoMates> Why are we cutting out our job to go and get drunk?>
[0:54:36] <rdddy> youtube closeups in tripple a
[0:54:37] <+PleasantLee> go stick your finger in the clones butt
[0:54:48] <JonesMcFly> GILF
[0:54:52] <ThirdPersonPhil> you are reading too much star wars crap
[0:54:56] <BillieNoMates> "Oh did you spit or swallow, Tifa?"
[0:54:58] <bazz_tv> Cloud ever heard the tale of Darth Sidious?
[0:55:09] <dukenux> OR ELSE
[0:55:11] <oshkeet41> You know Marle had like 5 husbands
[0:55:21] <law240> Your room is also rent free
[0:55:23] <rdddy> she ate 3 of them
[0:55:25] <%caramello_man> not one person has said "mercenary", they all say "merc"
[0:55:25] <dukenux> Marle killed all her ex husbands
[0:55:28] <+Dresdran> They all died from dehydration.
[0:55:29] <Phoenixianstyle> lol everyone knows an old lady like her doe
[0:55:42] <dukenux> theyre buried under her aparrment
[0:55:54] <bazz_tv> dew it
[0:55:57] <oshkeet41> honestly Marle is literally my old superintentdent and nosy as hell i love her
[0:56:01] <+PleasantLee> love this song
[0:56:06] <+Dresdran> For some reason all I can think of is the monk from Diablo 3 and some of his moves. Like the attack that teleports to nearby enemies.
[0:56:07] <rdddy> she keeps them under her bad for worse days
[0:56:08] <+PleasantLee> as the kids say, it bops
[0:56:11] <thesanderdc> simp
[0:56:27] <BillieNoMates> The stock is probably to prevent you farming them and trivialising the awful gameplay
[0:56:28] <SuperVaderMan> buy up all their toilet paper
[0:56:36] <+Dresdran> Just have Tifa with those kind of moves that have built in homing.
[0:56:54] <oshkeet41> i figured limited tuff is to keep you from grinding too early
[0:56:59] <law240> Press L2 and R2 for the mini map!
[0:57:11] <snowmanse> I miss the original where the sector 7 slum vendors threatened you
[0:57:57] <rdddy> it has similar gameplay to 15 right?
[0:57:59] <oshkeet41> plus they started giving you more magic options right when you got flying enemies
[0:58:04] <bazz_tv> if i never played the original is this worth my time?
[0:58:27] <Triblade1992> It's more of the jumping rather than the ground combat.
[0:58:27] <@dcn2049> That's the question
[0:58:38] <Phoenixianstyle> oh is plague talking about the dissidia air combos? lol
[0:58:39] <@dcn2049> Is this a game just for people that have played the original?
[0:58:44] <howimaginary> hello luvlys
[0:59:09] <bazz_tv> i see
[0:59:17] <law240> it's fun either way
[0:59:32] <law240> if you're new or not
[0:59:32] <oshkeet41> she's really poseheavy, but i guess it kinda makes sense if shes putting up a front
[0:59:36] <Triblade1992> If I want to play the original again, I will play the original again
[0:59:42] <oshkeet41> then again everyone is kinda poseheavy
[1:00:00] <BillieNoMates> friend zoned
[1:00:04] <law240> you can't do these missions after
[1:00:06] <thevilmen> she is training you
[1:00:14] <howimaginary> hmm...
[1:00:37] <@dcn2049> maintaining social niceties to keep the mood level
[1:00:38] <oshkeet41> Tifa's... Anxious Heart -sunglasses-
[1:00:39] <howimaginary> true
[1:00:40] <rdddy> the wants the ti-bone
[1:00:48] <$daveronald> anxious fucking
[1:00:49] <bazz_tv> she seems a bit clingy though
[1:00:55] <terminusterminal> AND HE'S TALKING ABOUT TIME GHOSTS NOW
[1:01:06] <howimaginary> the Fuk
[1:01:15] <Phoenixianstyle> what I've seen is that there's some stuff that's really just fanservice and "HEY REMEMBER THIS?!" but there's also some new stuff that's fresh but to me kinda like... umm what?
[1:01:17] <howimaginary> what kinda fun?
[1:01:17] <+HawkGoggles2> I would agree if the game didn't have blatant romance options.
[1:01:23] <oshkeet41> Barret with his kid is adorable
[1:01:36] <silenthillbookofmammaries> marlene is adorable
[1:01:47] <law240> she is showing around new pat of town how is that clingy you're basically coworker
[1:02:00] <BillieNoMates> Nah. They are incompetent
[1:02:03] <silenthillbookofmammaries> TITS
[1:02:06] <bazz_tv> that pinball table should be playable

[1:02:33] <silenthillbookofmammaries> drink this piss
[1:02:41] <$daveronald> taste sophisticated
[1:02:42] <BillieNoMates> She literally shook a pointless drink
[1:02:50] <oshkeet41> Cloud is absolutely the kind of guy who would drink dank ass whiskey to look cooler
[1:02:53] <terminusterminal> Look at these dynamics shots
[1:02:55] <BillieNoMates> "Im a retard, Tifa. Stop trying to get me drunk"
[1:03:07] <bazz_tv> is that dr pepper?
[1:03:12] <snowmanse> Yeah, an avalanche member wouldn't know the name of the place where Avalanche was founded.
[1:03:17] <+jetjagger222> tastes like cough medicine
[1:03:17] <BillieNoMates> Well it IS the slums
[1:03:19] <silenthillbookofmammaries> drink this penzoil cloud
[1:03:27] <rdddy> is it me or does this feel like a japenese sitcom?
[1:03:29] <BillieNoMates> Probably cherry
[1:03:31] <LunarRemix> Why not both?
[1:03:40] <SuperVaderMan> oh boy, it's time for horny
[1:03:42] <Phoenixianstyle> "GASP SHE SAID COSMO CANYON" I think that was their idea but it might also just be a Cosmopolitan lol
[1:03:57] <+silvery_cricket> She is a show dancer
[1:04:02] <BillieNoMates> She's an "actress" at the local bar
[1:04:08] <terminusterminal> Jesus Jessie.
[1:04:17] <+silvery_cricket> She is a not stripper
[1:04:17] <BillieNoMates> tifa just killed herself

[1:10:37] <bazz_tv> she really wants to get you drunk
[1:10:46] <+HawkGoggles2> Go play some original content.

[1:12:25] <+HawkGoggles2> Anxiety horny is dangerous.
[1:12:36] <bazz_tv> is Cloud dissacioating on purpose or is he just akward

[1:13:18] <+aittzu> what
[1:13:19] <oshkeet41> Plus Cloud is a safe target for teasing which is why i think Jessie goes in as much as she does
[1:13:20] <rdddy> cringe
[1:13:22] <Phoenixianstyle> huh I never thought about that, maybe she is just having issues with the fact that they put the world on their shoulders...
[1:13:23] <+PleasantLee> Barret is WORRIED!
[1:13:23] <vonmaultke> awkward as hell
[1:13:24] <BillieNoMates> Nowhere else to go

[1:13:33] <BillieNoMates> Shinra paid avalanche
[1:13:40] <+PleasantLee> did you know we're the phantom thieves?
[1:13:42] <BillieNoMates> Water filters can't make that much money
[1:13:49] <notanegg8> we are avalanche and we blew up a reactor!
[1:13:51] <bazz_tv> the fat one's voice sounds familiar
[1:13:58] <oshkeet41> Breaking Bad
[1:14:09] <LunarRemix> Wouldn't they be the anti-Nomura ghosts though?
[1:14:18] <CyberDingus> They are done talking. They will sit SILENTLY now.
[1:14:22] <bazz_tv> yeah but i feel i heard him somewhere else
[1:14:24] <BillieNoMates> Sorry, Wedge is fat.

[1:14:30] <+PleasantLee> he screams about his ass later
[1:14:37] <notanegg8> nah he's a fat character he's gotta

[1:16:27] <+PleasantLee> good ol' stump/stamp
[1:16:51] <BillieNoMates> Shit-tastic
[1:18:15] <overkrustice> So if that hasn't happened in this version how doesn't it make sense?
[1:18:26] <law240> Just go with it
[1:18:56] <BillieNoMates> Well it seems to change it so Shinra organises the reactor bombings so they can just deploy troops everywhere
[1:19:20] <dukenux> Tunnel Snakes Rule

[1:20:03] <overkrustice> I really don't see a lot of people irl with chest hair. Seem like a regional thing
[1:20:03] <+PleasantLee> when you scan them it says its some kind of dragon insignia
[1:20:18] <SuperVaderMan> You're required to walk like a doofus when you're a bad guy
[1:20:33] <hypersongi> In the original, I don't think they even had an insignia
[1:20:33] <rdddy> did they shit their pants?
[1:20:38] <dukenux> gangbang hole
[1:20:38] <law240> when you scan them you can look at the models

[1:22:51] <law240> ASSESS
[1:23:04] <+PleasantLee> you should really scan them with the assess thingy
[1:23:11] <%PlebianNoob> Are they dead papa plague?
[1:23:14] <BillieNoMates> I think seeing a guy with a 8ft giant sword is enough warning that the guys a member of SOLDIER
[1:23:15] <oshkeet41> theyre fine they didnt turn to magic dust right
[1:23:18] <law240> Killer
[1:23:42] <CyberDingus> They have half of their bones BROKEN desu
[1:23:45] <Triblade1992> @rdddy Oh god no. FF12 combat was slow, monotonous and annoying. I like how thiis combat plays a million times more
[1:24:05] <BillieNoMates> Nah. Jessie is here for benis
[1:24:05] <cap_bon> It was just a rubber sword they didint die

[1:25:13] <ralphwiggum16> plague i don't understand what you're trying to say, could you be less vague
[1:25:13] <BillieNoMates> "I need the cock, Cloud. And Barret has a machinegun there now"
[1:25:16] <+illoonar> Kappa
[1:25:22] <CyberDingus> something WILL get harder
[1:25:24] <Triblade1992> @rdddy You say that like DMC is a bad thing. =/
[1:25:28] <CyberDingus> that's her plan at least.
[1:25:38] <terminusterminal> Where the hell did she get Ifrit?
[1:25:45] <@dcn2049> It's like a jelly
[1:25:58] <BillieNoMates> From all the chafing, Term
[1:26:00] <+PleasantLee> summon materia has its own special slot
[1:26:02] <BillieNoMates> She's VERY active
[1:26:16] <overkrustice> @rdddy Button mashing will get you kill really fast.
[1:26:28] <law240> all weapons have one materia slot
[1:26:46] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 dmc are great games for what they are
[1:27:04] <Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes I believe you gain a slot specifically for summoning materia
[1:27:06] <CyberDingus> ''Can't go there - an another woman is nearby"
[1:27:09] <overkrustice> People made the texture load in sound like a major issue.
[1:27:11] <cap_bon> the texture streamin is a bit agressive some time
[1:27:11] <+PleasantLee> if you want to impress jessie I suggest making a save here
[1:27:28] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 for some reason in 2020 everything has to be hacknslash...
[1:28:12] <law240> she is
[1:28:24] <CyberDingus> ''WHAT DO YOU WANT, WOMAN?!"
[1:28:35] <+PleasantLee> if you do the next bit of the game without losing more than 20% of your health you impress Jessie and gain access to her magical cave
[1:28:45] <CyberDingus> huehuehue
[1:28:47] <cap_bon> what if she really justs wants that D
[1:28:52] <Triblade1992> @rdddy I feel like this game is FF13 combat meets KH combat. I guess you kinda have a point
[1:29:19] <overkrustice> Maybe she's using this "front" to hide how thirsty she is?
[1:29:23] <Huntercd> Charlie Sheen from Hot Shots
[1:29:29] <CyberDingus> Mr Handsome and Mr Fatguy
[1:29:31] <CyberDingus> best lads
[1:29:38] <jakekrow> our parents died in the bombing we did
[1:29:47] <cap_bon> why does biggs remind me of charlie sheen from two and a half men
[1:29:52] <+PleasantLee> look who's coming to dinner
[1:30:02] <overkrustice> GIVE ME MOTORCYCLE SEGMENT
[1:30:09] <overkrustice> every game should have one
[1:30:11] <terminusterminal> Why have his sword out now
[1:30:11] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 i honestly hated ff15 and i wont buy this, this type of gameplay isnt what i personaly expect from a ff game, not that that matters since the last games have been more busy with jpop and telling any interesting stories anway
[1:30:14] <BillieNoMates> Because you have to catch those tax dodgers
[1:30:30] <+HawkGoggles2> Just listen to that beat.
[1:30:37] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 instead of*
[1:30:53] <BillieNoMates> At least the bike isnt his Advent Children retardaton bike
[1:30:59] <BillieNoMates> So Nomura held back a bit
[1:31:09] <SilverRoddo> The sword is for bike balancing.
[1:31:10] <rdddy> that bike was best bike kek
[1:31:21] <BillieNoMates> Just wreck Biggs bike
[1:31:24] <+PleasantLee> square for left slash circle for right
[1:31:25] <SilverRoddo> What, astral chain?
[1:31:27] <BillieNoMates> Trap the blade in the spokes
[1:31:31] <Triblade1992> @rdddy I said the game was FF13 meets KH, not FF15. FF5 combat is KH like but with tryiinig to slow it down via Monster Hunter
[1:31:38] <terminusterminal> What happens if you just ram biggs off the road?
[1:31:45] <CyberDingus> Jessie CONTAIN yourself!!
[1:31:47] <+PleasantLee> ramps are only in the middle
[1:31:49] <cap_bon> Man the Ride to Hell renamke looks way better
[1:31:56] <+terry_quest> top left
[1:31:57] <overkrustice> R2 Accelerate
[1:31:58] <+PleasantLee> R2 to go forward
[1:31:59] <ZigZagaroo> Wait a minute, Plague’s real? Like he actually exists in this reality?
[1:31:59] <Huntercd> Horny Futaba here
[1:32:04] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 i know i mentioned ff15 because it was the lastest release
[1:32:11] <CyberDingus> Cloud is moody but he knows how to speak with hoes.
[1:32:11] <law240> top left for controls
[1:32:19] <+Dresdran> Not even an ocean could slake her thirst.
[1:32:20] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 latest*
[1:32:34] <ZigZagaroo> I always put him on the same level as a folk tale boogeyman
[1:32:42] <+PleasantLee> L1 is lock on, then press triangle
[1:32:43] <overkrustice> Honestlly I wish this could just be a straight up racing segment
[1:33:07] <overkrustice> I wanna drift as cloud
[1:33:08] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 also 13 was horrible ~~
[1:33:27] <SilverRoddo> Damn boxes.
[1:33:47] <Triblade1992> @rdddy Nah, I fond FF13 to be a 7/10 and FF15 a 7.5/10 (decent and mostly good with extremely questionable decision making)
[1:34:05] <+PleasantLee> triangle while not holding lock on is an AOE spin attack
[1:34:10] <BillieNoMates> Designed the bike with that in mind
[1:34:21] <+terry_quest> fyi u can guard
[1:34:40] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:34:40] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 thats your opinion mine is that it sucked gameplay and storywise :p
[1:35:11] <+PleasantLee> I feel tou'll fail to impress Jessie
[1:35:16] <overkrustice> THERE HE IS
[1:35:18] <overkrustice> my boy
[1:35:20] <rdddy> @Triblade1992 and im not even gonna touch 15 with a ten foot pole after just seeing the combat
[1:35:31] <+PleasantLee> this guy is just the guitar guy from KH2
[1:35:35] <SilverRoddo> Cool guy
[1:35:40] <LunarRemix> Demyx
[1:35:47] <LunarRemix> But this one's cool instead of lame
[1:36:03] <+Tyonidus> oh yeah Plague's favorite part of the game right here boys :)
[1:36:07] <+QuasartheHero> Dance water Dance
[1:36:11] <overkrustice> HE GREAT
[1:36:12] <+QuasartheHero> bitterShook bitterShook bitterShook
[1:36:28] <overkrustice> I love how he moves his bike.
[1:36:34] <overkrustice> I dislike his english VA though
[1:36:42] <CyberDingus> that bike's seat is wet now.
[1:36:48] <+PleasantLee> I feel so sorry for these dudes
[1:37:00] <cap_bon> Biggs gettin in the way of that D
[1:37:10] <+PleasantLee> spinning slash move is just triangle when not holding L1
[1:37:12] <overkrustice> you just hit triangle when it's charge
[1:37:20] <overkrustice> LOOK AT HIM
[1:37:31] <+PleasantLee> THIS GUY IS AN ASSHOLE
[1:37:33] <overkrustice> "It's not cool" get out
[1:37:37] <law240> Ban him
[1:37:37] <CyberDingus> Does he fuck bikes at his free time?
[1:37:39] <+Tyonidus> atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner
[1:37:41] <SilverRoddo> So, i’m guessin’ Jesse has a crush, i think it’s just me.
[1:37:42] <LunarRemix> NO HE'S COOL
[1:37:44] <overkrustice> IT'S AWESOME
[1:37:44] <%PlebianNoob> What a chad
[1:37:49] <%JailShmixRemix> That guy looks super cool dude 4Head
[1:37:50] <+HawkGoggles2> The flippy-est of dips.
[1:37:53] <oshkeet41> Getting Chrono Trigger vibes
[1:37:55] <oshkeet41> from this guy
[1:38:03] <rdddy> go find a barber kevin omfg..
[1:38:20] <SilverRoddo> erinpl1Sailormoon sorry
[1:38:28] <CyberDingus> this is VERY Japanese.
[1:38:30] <overkrustice> COOL AS SHIT
[1:38:42] <Murphio_GS> Speeen
[1:38:45] <ZigZagaroo> Papa Roche?
[1:38:55] <+PleasantLee> slow down when he does lightning
[1:38:59] <overkrustice> Roads... tend to be long
[1:39:16] <cap_bon> Biggs doin his best
[1:39:17] <+QuasartheHero> Almost like he's supposed to be lame?
[1:39:19] <oshkeet41> you stop at the end and you're in Junon with no gas enough to get back
[1:39:23] <+theparisreview> What anime is this?
[1:39:33] <SilverRoddo> Roads are paved with the COOLEST of intentions
[1:39:39] <Triblade1992> What Plague, you don't like "Nomura's Wild KINO ride"?
[1:39:45] <+PleasantLee> slooooow down
[1:39:52] <CyberDingus> He fucks his bike. Yes.
[1:39:52] <TomFrank> are these the new chocobos?
[1:40:07] <%caramello_man> this section is bad holy shit
[1:40:17] <+terry_quest> guard
[1:40:22] <+PleasantLee> its easy to avoid his lightning attacks if you slow down
[1:40:32] <law240> WEave
[1:40:41] <oshkeet41> i sucked at the OG mtorocycle minigame so i cant talk
[1:40:47] <+QuasartheHero> I think this bit is cool, just going on a bit long
[1:40:48] <overkrustice> Plague can't handle a true alpha male.
[1:40:49] <+PleasantLee> dont hold accelerate when he casts lightning shit
[1:40:58] <SilverRoddo> I hope Lightning shows up, whenever, to show-up this guy.
[1:40:59] <law240> his sword turns white
[1:41:08] <+PleasantLee> you failed to impress Jessie BTW
[1:41:11] <kuzokai> we have achieved peak nomura
[1:41:17] <CyberDingus> Wait, guys, is this Jojo?
[1:41:25] <Jrockoni> hes kinda fun
[1:41:26] <+Shotgundam009> yeah
[1:41:30] <Flamethrowerman09> His voice actor and dialogue suck
[1:41:30] <overkrustice> @CyberDingus It's even better than Jojo
[1:41:36] <SilverRoddo> He’s dance-ridin’.
[1:41:40] <+terry_quest> almost like this game is a fantasy g
[1:41:53] <snowmanse> It would've been better if he started out bored, and gradually ramped up to this crazy.
[1:41:54] <ZigZagaroo> Did this fucker just exclaim “Vroom”?
[1:41:57] <oshkeet41> if this was sqwuall he'd just hit the breaks and watch the dude ride off
[1:41:59] <%PlebianNoob> No he said to the death
[1:42:03] <kuzokai> remember advent children
[1:42:05] <SilverRoddo> Yes. Plot damage.
[1:42:10] <+Tyonidus> bye Evil Kinevil
[1:42:13] <+QuasartheHero> Think we'll get sa villan like kefka again?
[1:42:13] <Flamethrowerman09> he is a total filler character
[1:42:23] <cap_bon> why arent we finishing him off right now
[1:42:26] <overkrustice> I hope this game sells a billion copies and he comes back in the sequel
[1:42:31] <+PleasantLee> WHAT
[1:42:35] <ZigZagaroo> You did nothing
[1:42:40] <+PleasantLee> You lost so much health
[1:42:43] <law240> yea with summon materia
[1:42:44] <+PleasantLee> how did you pass
[1:42:47] <overkrustice> Jessie butt, good butt
[1:42:54] <Huntercd> She is grinding on the bike
[1:42:58] <+PleasantLee> wait, this is different
[1:42:58] <Kampler21> imagine roche being a playable character in the later parts
[1:43:01] <+HawkGoggles2> What's this music?
[1:43:14] <overkrustice> If she's 15 then I'm 15
[1:43:16] <+PleasantLee> wow theres 3 ending for the bike battle
[1:43:16] <CyberDingus> Clingy Japanese Girlfriend cliche
[1:43:18] <Huntercd> That seat needs to be washed
[1:43:26] <Relinfearous> no way, homo
[1:43:27] <SilverRoddo> Theme of Tease
[1:43:27] <ZigZagaroo> -_-
[1:43:29] <arran_throttle> Cloud: No way Fam
[1:43:33] <Phoenixianstyle> I just wanna know how cloud jumped and stayed in front of the moving motorcycle...
[1:43:34] <overkrustice> Wash the seat with your tongue
[1:43:35] <+Dresdran> Make muscles.
[1:43:38] <oshkeet41> tbh it's Cloud's fate to be teased mercilessly by women
[1:43:44] <Jrockoni> NO WAY FRIEND
[1:43:47] <gunsrlove> Was she hot tho
[1:43:50] <sosuke5> FAT
[1:43:52] <cap_bon> Cloud doesnt even know what sex is stop wasting our time jessie
[1:44:02] <Relinfearous> PedoBear
[1:44:15] <ZigZagaroo> Get it?
[1:44:18] <+PleasantLee> you'll meet him again in the next hour or so
[1:44:18] <Huntercd> Jessie's off to change clothes
[1:44:20] <overkrustice> IT WAS ME
[1:44:23] <+Dresdran> Clearly every woman should have the instinctive need to tease him.
[1:44:23] <ZigZagaroo> He’s the fat one
[1:44:24] <Relinfearous> monkaS
[1:44:26] <overkrustice> HE'S GREAT
[1:44:34] <law240> megamoS
[1:44:38] <LunarRemix> Would you honestly say that 11 year old you wouldn't like this guy?
[1:44:44] <Kampler21> isn't that just Nomura Kappa
[1:44:51] <Kampler21> Ban nomura
[1:44:53] <+Dresdran> Just relentlessly tease cloud fro being a dork that is trying to be a stoic badass.
[1:45:00] <+muzzle_roar24> I think he is cool in an uncool way rooSip
[1:45:22] <overkrustice> Nah, i'd hate him at 9 but now, I love him
[1:45:39] <law240> yeah
[1:45:40] <overkrustice> You literally becomed 10x cooler with every flip
[1:46:03] <law240> but they were just middle management
[1:46:05] <oshkeet41> fairness, Edge is pretty fast for a fat dude
[1:46:06] <+PleasantLee> wow 1 minute?
[1:46:12] <+PleasantLee> thats a fast poty
[1:46:19] <overkrustice> ALright chat let's put this to rest
[1:46:24] <cap_bon> so are we gettin paid with that red orb or is this all for free
[1:46:27] <+MeTaylor> the trick is to use the bathroom and get something to drink at the same time
[1:46:29] <Phoenixianstyle> he's so over the top that he ends up making himself uncool to me, less sometimes is more I suppose
[1:46:33] <SilverRoddo> Yes, fan arts?
[1:46:34] <overkrustice> Roache, Great character, or best character?
[1:46:39] <ZigZagaroo> Can’t wait for Dunkey to give this a -5/10
[1:46:46] <Relinfearous> No way, Jessie LUL
[1:46:47] <oshkeet41> that Now Way Fa* meme redone but its Jessie and Cloud
[1:47:01] <SilverRoddo> Where can i submit, or does he just finds them?
[1:47:09] <law240> Wedge has the luck Materia on thats why he survived @PlagueOfGripes
[1:47:09] <+PleasantLee> Roche is a character that never showed up in crisis core but somehow escaped and made it here
[1:47:21] <kuzokai> ^
[1:47:22] <overkrustice> Roach is a blessing is what he is
[1:47:24] <+Dresdran> Those guys remind me of emo goth villains, which make it really hard for me to take them seriously.
[1:47:32] <Triblade1992> @ZigZagaroo Dunkey is such a poser. "UUUUGH JAPANESE WRTIER BAAAAD! WESTERN WRITER GUUUUUD!!!"
[1:47:33] <LunarRemix> Eh, I think he's fine. If he was in the original no one would bat an eye.
[1:48:01] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Eli, redraw that NWF meme with these two please
[1:48:03] <oshkeet41> "Hey Cloud wanna blow up in my reactor core? Its bubbling right now" "No Way Scag"
[1:48:06] <ZigZagaroo> @triblade1992 k
[1:48:16] <law240> CRIT %
[1:48:23] <+PleasantLee> looking at the Shinra hierachy on twitter. why is palmer on the same tier as scarlet, hojo and stuff
[1:48:31] <+PleasantLee> reeve too
[1:48:34] <TheWe4pon> crit chance and steal rate i think?
[1:48:39] <overkrustice> It's a decent meme
[1:48:42] <sosuke5> "Please fuck me, Cloud" "No chance, avalanche"
[1:48:47] <+Dresdran> This just reminds me that I need to do more stuff involving one of my favorite characters for the game I GM, the antagonist turned friend.
[1:48:57] <CyberDingus> Close Enough
[1:48:59] <ZigZagaroo> Congrats Plague you birthed a monster
[1:49:01] <+Dresdran> It practically happened.
[1:49:04] <+PleasantLee> if you impress her fully she gives you a smooch
[1:49:12] <CyberDingus> warp?
[1:49:12] <oshkeet41> Nomura's obviously a plague fan
[1:49:12] <Phoenixianstyle> lmao no chance avalanche
[1:49:20] <CyberDingus> Do we need inquisitors now?
[1:49:20] <+Dresdran> Warhammer 40K.
[1:49:21] <+HawkGoggles2> It's being drawn by the void right now.
[1:49:26] <+Dresdran> Do you feel it overtaking you?
[1:49:39] <+Dresdran> Company town.
[1:50:17] <law240> You aren't automatically taken care of it's money were you live your business I'm guessing
[1:50:20] <overkrustice> @PlagueOfGripes I could see them setting up a section that's better than the usual residential areas?
[1:50:34] <SuperVaderMan> lookit that scoot LUL
[1:50:35] <CyberDingus> the fat run
[1:50:39] <+PleasantLee> thats pretty much how he ran in original
[1:50:41] <SilverRoddo> Be wary of Snickers bars.
[1:50:47] <LunarRemix> I'm convinced they took Goofy's run cycle from Kingdom Hearts.
[1:51:03] <oshkeet41> it looks like theyre worried he's gonna clip into his own model
[1:51:45] <KaiserMario> You mean something like Kingpin would be fine, but someone like Wedge is not?
[1:51:53] <+Dresdran> Wedge feels like he should be a small NPC.
[1:51:54] <sadboy_otoroshi> Just draw a circles and squares with hats on them for secondary characters.
[1:51:57] <cap_bon> All fat guy characters must be as menacing as Heart from fist of the north star
[1:52:04] <oshkeet41> i think they get away with it cause wedge had such a simple model to begin with but yeah
[1:52:06] <+PleasantLee> its called a suburb
[1:52:19] <+PleasantLee> no way friend
[1:52:42] <snowmanse> basketball minigame is gold saucer, so hopefully in part 2
[1:52:43] <oshkeet41> gilgamesh comes back this court on the 3 game with six baseballs and you shoot hoops with him
[1:53:05] <law240> L2 R2 fo minimap
[1:53:16] <+PleasantLee> yes
[1:53:19] <+PleasantLee> it does
[1:53:24] <overkrustice> You can always see real ass cloud, he's the main character.
[1:53:42] <Jrockoni> can cloud dunk?
[1:53:43] <SilverRoddo> I feel Cloud could dunk a basket like the way Heero Yuy did.
[1:53:47] <+xShenzi> Fat man like food!
[1:54:00] <+HawkGoggles2> Wedge is her favorite.
[1:54:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> The planet would be spinning uncontrollably and the weather would be a mess.
[1:54:16] <overkrustice> Me like path
[1:54:22] <overkrustice> pipe
[1:54:31] <KaiserMario> I'm curious about this next bit
[1:54:33] <+PleasantLee> you'll know
[1:54:43] <CyberDingus> Just wait?
[1:54:49] <+Punishedkaiger> They're telling you to be a loner again
[1:54:55] <+Dresdran> You know what to do: brood.
[1:55:03] <SilverRoddo> Did she say that phrase before?
[1:55:29] <+HawkGoggles2> This game loves cats.
[1:55:33] <overkrustice> Their tounge was too bright
[1:55:34] <SilverRoddo> HahaCat
[1:55:39] <ThorW> Because someone at Square realy loves cats
[1:55:41] <oshkeet41> i thought he was talking seriously to the cats
[1:55:42] <+xShenzi> Got their priorities straight
[1:55:42] <SuperVaderMan> Wedge designed those cats
[1:55:47] <ZigZagaroo> CAT GRAPHICS
[1:55:52] <overkrustice> The had to practice cats to make red 13
[1:56:01] <%PlebianNoob> Then you find out that wasn't the signal
[1:56:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> That's why it took 7 years to make, perfect cat graphics.
[1:56:04] <law240> ????
[1:56:09] <jackdulahan> LUL
[1:56:10] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Eli, don't judge a horny young woman
[1:56:12] <overkrustice> Why would you say what?
[1:56:12] <%Rezca> The Cat Signal
[1:56:25] <+PleasantLee> stand by the kitchen door for great dialogue about how Jessie's mum knows not to consider Wedge as potential partner for her daughter
[1:56:30] <KaiserMario> God... I've had that talk with an ex... it sucks...
[1:56:41] <SilverRoddo> What’s this mission?
[1:56:59] <KaiserMario> Plague, why u so real...?
[1:56:59] <overkrustice> What do you guys got against some roleplay
[1:57:02] <+PleasantLee> you fool
[1:57:17] <SuperVaderMan> jesus jessie
[1:57:19] <+PleasantLee> snoop around
[1:57:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> *akward stlaking*
[1:57:25] <%Rezca> ICU Dad
[1:57:28] <Jrockoni> steal this dying mans morphine!
[1:57:29] <LunarRemix> FYI don't rush this part or you lose some dialogue
[1:57:31] <law240> MAko megamoCry megamoS
[1:57:32] <sadboy_otoroshi> stalking*
[1:57:33] <ZigZagaroo> Ok
[1:57:39] <oshkeet41> search the poop for potions
[1:57:47] <+PleasantLee> shes soooo cute
[1:57:47] <KaiserMario> @overkrustice There's roleplay, and then there's some weird issues that you'd rather not touch ever
[1:57:50] <SuperVaderMan> Cloud, I want you to rob my comatose father
[1:57:51] <oshkeet41> the best hiding place
[1:57:52] <+PleasantLee> look at her holding a wrench
[1:57:59] <law240> you still think he works for shinra?
[1:58:00] <CyberDingus> Jessie has a reason why she is so thirsty all the time it seems
[1:58:01] <ZigZagaroo> We just gonna rob this comatose man?
[1:58:07] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Do yellow suit last
[1:58:16] <ZigZagaroo> Steal candy from a baby and what not?
[1:58:19] <overkrustice> Yeah it's really nice to see more of her.
[1:58:21] <SilverRoddo> Jesse’s mom probably has that thick braid of hair that drapes over her shoulder in front of her.
[1:58:25] <+PleasantLee> Wedge calls Jessie's mum Mrs. R
[1:58:25] <+HawkGoggles2> This is a new Jessie, more character, more horny.
[1:58:35] <%Rezca> standard office phone
[1:58:41] <+PleasantLee> the one on the floor is safe
[1:58:46] <Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes look at the yellow suit last
[1:58:50] <+PleasantLee> dont inspect the jump suit yet
[1:58:51] <law240> too much life in the lower plate
[1:58:53] <Triblade1992> Slums are known for being a mish mash of things though
[1:58:58] <SilverRoddo> Letter from Ultros?
[1:58:58] <law240> you goofed already
[1:59:01] <sadboy_otoroshi> It would be funny if they had dial wheel phones.
[1:59:06] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes I said yellow suit last
[1:59:12] <overkrustice> Get cutscened
[1:59:14] <Void_The_Dark> You ruined it
[1:59:32] <Void_The_Dark> ah.
[1:59:38] <Void_The_Dark> can still read this one at least
[1:59:52] <cap_bon> HAHA you fool you fell right into my critical path trap
[1:59:55] <%Rezca> This cover story seems suspect
[2:00:00] <+PleasantLee> RASPBERRY!
[2:00:06] <Fancycuffs> "Wait... Jessie's a girl?"
[2:00:08] <+PleasantLee> I LOVE IT
[2:00:10] <SilverRoddo> I like the Persona font.
[2:00:10] <Triblade1992> I like the cutscene heavy stuff like in FF10 and FF13.
[2:00:23] <terminusterminal> As if this day couldn't get any worse
[2:00:40] <oshkeet41> Maybe she plays the dragon?
[2:00:49] <overkrustice> Maybe, but this isn't the original game.
[2:00:52] <%Rezca> PERFECT COVER STORY
[2:01:02] <+PleasantLee> no they pull the people from the crowd just for cloud and aeris because they won a contest
[2:01:05] <jiggydoo> Hello Plague!
[2:01:09] <overkrustice> So it could be a real role in this version.
[2:01:09] <oshkeet41> i thought she was just BSing and didnt wanna tell her folks about the terrorism
[2:01:10] <law240> you goofed
[2:01:14] <Fancycuffs> It's an actor's job to fake it
[2:01:20] <Jrockoni> I think shes lying to her parents. not like they can actually go to the gold saucer and check on it.
[2:01:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> Saving face in front of everyone?
[2:01:21] <Phoenixianstyle> plague shut up, you know they thought no one remembers lol
[2:01:25] <KaiserMario> Yeah
[2:01:26] <red_blaster> She has pictures of her on stage on the walls, so I guess she really is an actress. Or was.
[2:01:40] <$SomeNEET> Has it started getting DUMB yet?
[2:01:43] <ZigZagaroo> “Your done here” Pulls the plug
[2:01:54] <law240> I guess you'll find out then
[2:01:56] <Jrockoni> like going out to LA and saying your working in film when your just a coffee guy
[2:02:07] <+PleasantLee> Cloud and Aeris got pulled from the crowd because they were the 1 millionth people to walk through the door or some shit
[2:02:18] <sosuke5> Why does the back door have a welcome mat?
[2:02:22] <overkrustice> They aren't flipping them off, just making it different from how they remember
[2:02:23] <+PleasantLee> so jessies roll is probably real
[2:02:34] <SuperVaderMan> MORE
[2:02:53] <Fancycuffs> Give me more POWER
[2:02:58] <cap_bon> my defining character trait is food how did you know jessies mom
[2:03:24] <red_blaster> Jessie = Horny Actress. Wedge = Fat. Biggs = ???
[2:03:25] <Fancycuffs> Wedge is the big guy, but isn't named Biggs
[2:03:28] <%Rezca> clumsy oaf
[2:03:34] <overkrustice> Biggs=hot
[2:03:40] <red_blaster> For clothes
[2:03:40] <+PleasantLee> sex rack
[2:03:41] <oshkeet41> laundry rack
[2:03:43] <CyberDingus> it's for clothes
[2:03:44] <overkrustice> Cloths dryer?
[2:03:44] <+Punishedkaiger> Laundry
[2:03:45] <sosuke5> clothes rack
[2:03:45] <law240> work bench
[2:03:46] <sadboy_otoroshi> Fiat + volkswagen?
[2:03:47] <$WoRabbit> for drying clothes
[2:03:48] <oshkeet41> drying
[2:03:49] <+xShenzi> it's to hang your clothes to dry
[2:03:50] <$SomeNEET> Sex Table™
[2:03:51] <CyberDingus> Plague pls
[2:03:52] <cap_bon> Biggs is to hot for this group
[2:03:54] <sadboy_otoroshi> oh
[2:04:08] <CyberDingus> Plague move on :v
[2:04:08] <oshkeet41> saves space
[2:04:09] <KaiserMario> The "fat goof" trope is lazy and kinda of offensive when you think about it... Often common too...
[2:04:09] <sosuke5> city thing
[2:04:11] <$WoRabbit> it's for if you don't have a real back yard
[2:04:13] <oshkeet41> my aunt had one
[2:04:13] <LunarRemix> Because city Plague.
[2:04:13] <red_blaster> I have one of those
[2:04:15] <overkrustice> Not japanese I got one
[2:04:20] <red_blaster> THEY HAVE GUNS
[2:04:23] <+Punishedkaiger> If it's next to the car it could be for a stretcher thing, but I have one of those for my clothes
[2:04:23] <+PleasantLee> WHO PUT THESE BRICKS HERE?
[2:04:27] <cap_bon> because space
[2:04:33] <Fancycuffs> Is that Squall?
[2:04:39] <red_blaster> THEY HAVE GUNS AND ARMOR, LADY
[2:04:44] <+PleasantLee> maybe get a rubber mat instead of plastic
[2:04:47] <KaiserMario> Yeah I thought that was Squall too!
[2:04:53] <SuperVaderMan> "Jessie, why are you and your friends wearing body armor and bandoliers?"
[2:04:57] <red_blaster> OH WEDGE
[2:04:59] <oshkeet41> oic "i work really far away where you cant find me and see me blowing up buildings"
[2:05:02] <$SomeNEET> Is wedge the meth friend from Breaking Bad?
[2:05:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> Totally normal clothes to wear right?
[2:05:05] <Jrockoni> jessie claims to be an actress yet shows up home in body armor with guys with guns.
[2:05:05] <$SomeNEET> he sounds super familiar
[2:05:09] <+Punishedkaiger> Poor Wedge
[2:05:11] <overkrustice> I'm... actually super curious what's in the midgar special
[2:05:11] <KaiserMario> Final Fantasy characters and their MCs with Karen haircuts
[2:05:16] <overkrustice> Oh, now I'm hungry
[2:05:23] <ZigZagaroo> HE EATS
[2:05:33] <SilverRoddo> I can be tempted with more.
[2:05:35] <%JailShmixRemix> HE EATS
[2:05:40] <%Rezca> that is future raspberry problems
[2:05:45] <sosuke5> If I saw Cloud just standing out in public at night, I'd assume he's waiting for a gay hookup
[2:06:02] <+PleasantLee> remember to use assess materia and triple slash
[2:06:10] <overkrustice> @sosuke5 If I saw Cloud standing out in public, I would be the gay hookup
[2:06:10] <law240> company security really isn't that good
[2:06:12] <CyberDingus> Perky Steel Titties
[2:06:19] <KaiserMario> Did he punch his dick?
[2:06:35] <$SomeNEET> oh man wedge totally IS the meth head from breaking bad
[2:06:58] <%JailShmixRemix> He is
[2:07:11] <LunarRemix> They all are, they are terrorists.
[2:07:17] <cap_bon> Handsome Briggs needs his own game
[2:07:27] <KaiserMario> Same actor
[2:07:39] <sadboy_otoroshi> Wait a second... Wouldn't just Shira notice that one of his employees that it's in a comatose state suddenly registered his keycard somewhere?
[2:08:01] <overkrustice> I think that picture was just her talking an interests in her fathers work?
[2:08:02] <KaiserMario> Shut up, don't ask questions, consume product
[2:08:12] <+HawkGoggles2> I'd blow things up for that.
[2:08:24] <jiggydoo> Is Wedge Badger??
[2:08:33] <+PleasantLee> MAKO POISONING KILLED MY CHEF!
[2:08:33] <KaiserMario> Yes, same actor
[2:08:45] <Jrockoni> wedge must consume the make himself
[2:08:49] <CyberDingus> Small hoe can't hurt anyone
[2:08:50] <%JailShmixRemix> Wedge's Va also played hector in Bobs burgers
[2:08:50] <LunarRemix> If the planet sucks mako then it won't produce food for me to eat!
[2:08:57] <terminusterminal> "If I turn off Mako Reactors I can eat the Lifestream myself!"
[2:08:57] <overkrustice> I think the point is that her reason is well researched and probably true
[2:09:02] <Fancycuffs> Wedge was a wedge of cheese turned human through mako poisoning
[2:09:06] <LunarRemix> If shinra*
[2:09:14] <CyberDingus> some shonen anime
[2:09:27] <+PleasantLee> he'll get a grain of personality
[2:09:29] <KaiserMario> Some off-brand Metal Gear rip-off kinda game, but yeah
[2:09:48] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah, now that you mention it
[2:09:54] <+Neoripo> Biggs is pathologically clean
[2:09:55] <LunarRemix> You change his colors and he becomes Snake
[2:10:08] <+PleasantLee> go right
[2:10:18] <+PleasantLee> stop
[2:10:21] <overkrustice> I really don't think the sephiroth scenes at the start will confuse people much. They are pretty basic.
[2:10:29] <oshkeet41> i guess cause Biggs whole thing is the "calm" one but with cloud here now it feels weird
[2:10:33] <%bettysharkface> Good morning
[2:10:37] <+PleasantLee> training room
[2:10:42] <%bettysharkface> How are the time ghosts this morning?
[2:10:43] <+PleasantLee> its weird that its here
[2:10:47] <CyberDingus> Charlie Sheen is right
[2:10:56] <sadboy_otoroshi> There aren't like cameras everywhere? Oh right, consume product...
[2:11:23] <oshkeet41> ..oh dang. The benches have a Save Point logo on it.
[2:11:40] <+PleasantLee> training centre
[2:11:50] <%JailShmixRemix> I'm pretty sure he's crazy
[2:12:05] <overkrustice> I'll say more than a little
[2:12:27] <+PleasantLee> you can buy music from some vending machines too
[2:12:30] <KaiserMario> This game is pretty great, it's just a shame it has some excess Nomura in it
[2:12:45] <oshkeet41> why does this feel like youll run into a yellow hazard BOSS FIGHTIN COMIN sign
[2:12:45] <Fancycuffs> Stop for a coke and a talisman
[2:12:47] <overkrustice> This game is great and restored my faith in Nomura
[2:12:55] <%Rezca> ah, picking up a nice bulletproof vest from my local vending machine
[2:13:14] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:13:15] <KaiserMario> @overkrustice Did you finish it already?
[2:13:43] <@Nightbot> @law240 -> I do what I must. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[2:13:47] <overkrustice> Yep, played without items too.
[2:13:55] <CyberDingus> oh hey
[2:13:58] <+PleasantLee> A FAN !
[2:13:58] <CyberDingus> Tifa time
[2:14:00] <kingra> Why?
[2:14:01] <+PleasantLee> JUST LIKE HOME
[2:14:03] <KaiserMario> Ok then...
[2:14:09] <CyberDingus> before she was a titty monster
[2:14:14] <law240> doodRage
[2:14:15] <SuperVaderMan> baby cloud
[2:14:23] <%bettysharkface> Nice mullet faceface
[2:14:26] <oshkeet41> Cloud sounds so nervous and awkward i love it
[2:14:26] <law240> doodThirst
[2:14:41] <CyberDingus> explains the HUGE sword
[2:14:48] <smile64> i like how the kid forms still have the adult voices
[2:15:07] <overkrustice> Nah, you hear about him from chapter 2 as you should.
[2:15:26] <CyberDingus> Promise me to save me. I have a vagina. Remember it.
[2:15:27] <sadboy_otoroshi> Puberty hit them early.
[2:15:31] <@dcn2049> younger Tifa knew she was gonna get into some shit
[2:15:34] <Triblade1992> Plague, EVERYONE has heard about Sephiroth at this point. 20 years of hammering it in that Sephy is the bad guy does that to the general public
[2:15:45] <+HawkGoggles2> I know this is baby Tifa but older Tifa still wants this. That's why I say she wants to fuck.
[2:15:50] <%JailShmixRemix> Who's Sephiroth
[2:16:09] <kingra> But Sephiroth is NOT the bad guy.
[2:16:16] <overkrustice> I really don't think some basic flashbacks are that confusing.
[2:16:18] <kingra> It's genova
[2:16:23] <overkrustice> Most people will follow pretty easily
[2:16:30] <oshkeet41> id definately shit some of the cutscenes around timing wise
[2:16:33] <oshkeet41> *shift
[2:16:55] <law240> I feel like more people have seen Advent Childen than play the original
[2:17:19] <Triblade1992> Does that make Kefka the Emperor of Fiinal Fantasy?
[2:17:20] <oshkeet41> Seph was a lot more downplayed and rare in the orignial game until much later
[2:17:21] <CyberDingus> No guts? Awwww
[2:17:22] <+PleasantLee> that guy got knocked out real hard by that gun bullet
[2:17:27] <oshkeet41> he's too marketable now i guess
[2:17:28] <%PlebianNoob> I need a history lesson on this shit. I have only heard about sepheroth and watch advent children, but I was supper confused by it.
[2:17:47] <overkrustice> gun is useful when you can't use a meter wide sword
[2:17:48] <@dcn2049> haha advent children
[2:18:07] <overkrustice> I think that people will think "This mysterious guy did something to cloud in the past" I don't think there will be "confusion" per say
[2:18:16] <KaiserMario> Abusing iconic imagery for the sake of nostalgia fondling is something Star Wars did a lot in recently...
[2:18:20] <+PleasantLee> use triple slash
[2:18:53] <law240> ^
[2:18:58] <overkrustice> It's a lot easier to sneak inside when you make the 50 guards come outside.
[2:19:40] <CyberDingus> all those seeking missiles. NONE has hit the target.
[2:20:24] <overkrustice> Guns are there so you can have cool bullets flying the background, not for offense
[2:20:36] <CyberDingus> Was just about to say it.
[2:20:40] <KaiserMario> @overkrustice Yeah, I suppose people could think that, but it's still jaring, and there are other ways to do exposition like that
[2:20:50] <Triblade1992> @KaiserMario Eh, Prequels era did that a long time ago too. George Lucas and his poetry caused a lot of "Look at this iconic scene! it's a dark reflection of that scene!"
[2:21:41] <overkrustice> @KaiserMario Don't get me wrong I think there are more impactful ways they could have handled it. I'm just saying it's not confusing.
[2:21:55] <KaiserMario> @Triblade1992 True, but in terms of plot, George didn't really lean too hard on past stuff, which is way there are a lot of inconsistencies with the original stuff
[2:22:00] <Triblade1992> Me neither. There is a difference between repetition and repetitiive
[2:22:29] <$Rivalshotzgp> Plague confirmed hated Spirit Circle
[2:22:54] <overkrustice> I think it's a great technique but you gotta do it in ful ways that flow well
[2:23:02] <overkrustice> *fun ways
[2:23:13] <KaiserMario> @overkrustice I wouldn't go so far as to say it's not confusing, because I know who he is... I'd have to ask someone who never played it
[2:23:40] <sadboy_otoroshi> Sure it's nice to know when something is trash.
[2:23:41] <%JailShmixRemix> Is cloud a boss character to the generic soldiers atamThink
[2:24:10] <sosuke5> but it rhymes though
[2:24:12] <LunarRemix> Meanwhile Palpatine Palpatine Palpatine
[2:24:14] <LunarRemix> lol
[2:24:25] <overkrustice> Yeah if it's stopping unique things from happening it sucks, but I think it's often done in great ways.
[2:24:29] <overkrustice> sometimes
[2:24:31] <+HawkGoggles2> Repeating elements is fine just show a contrast or something.
[2:24:44] <Triblade1992> I like that main line entry Final Fantasy relegate that to just a one off reference and then being done with it. Every FF post 7 has the obligatory FF7 reference and then gets away from it.
[2:25:00] <+forgetme000> It was done realy badly in sw
[2:25:26] <+Dresdran> It would be more fun if he had a bunch of stances.
[2:25:26] <jiggydoo> As long as it's not overdone it's fine
[2:26:00] <+PleasantLee> I think if you want to learn the triple slash ability you need to use it in battle a few times
[2:26:02] <overkrustice> Hearing the same note a thousand times sucks but you can use a leit motif to excellet effect.
[2:26:21] <+Dresdran> A really fast one for closing in, a medium one for mixed combat, and then Punisher mode for crowds/bosses.
[2:26:42] <%JailShmixRemix> Wedge got this!
[2:26:43] <+PleasantLee> NOOOO! MY ASS, WHERE THE FOOD I EAT COMES OUT OF
[2:26:47] <sosuke5> What a hero!
[2:26:50] <%bettysharkface> The joke is he's fat
[2:26:52] <%bettysharkface> Get it
[2:26:55] <sadboy_otoroshi> Fast meat
[2:26:55] <+HawkGoggles2> Wedge is putting in work.
[2:26:56] <LunarRemix> F A T G U Y
[2:27:02] <terminusterminal> This jarring tone is just like the old game
[2:27:03] <oshkeet41> I wanna laugh but honestly he runs faster than I do
[2:27:06] <LunarRemix> HES FUNNY 'CAUSE HES FAT
[2:27:08] <Jrockoni> and then wedge was mauled to death
[2:27:08] <Fancycuffs> We're he running with all that cake?
[2:27:08] <Triblade1992> Eh, kind of in line with him jumping out of the fiire in the first FF7
[2:27:12] <KaiserMario> LUL that Plague knowingly expression LUL
[2:27:23] <overkrustice> Come on guys let him have this one moment where he's not talking about good
[2:27:25] <+PleasantLee> heeeeal
[2:27:31] <Keelan1990> Why would it die?
[2:27:39] <%JailShmixRemix> This song atamThink
[2:27:40] <+PleasantLee> dont let wedges ass go to waste
[2:27:54] <%Rezca> juicy thicc
[2:27:56] <Keelan1990> Peoples expectations are so low nowadays it's depressing
[2:27:57] <@dcn2049> he smells of bacon
[2:27:57] <+Dresdran> Why do they hate fat people?
[2:27:59] <overkrustice> He would be though
[2:28:04] <+PleasantLee> hahhahaha, Wedges underwear says "Juicy" on it
[2:28:05] <%JailShmixRemix> because its japan
[2:28:10] <SilverRoddo> He’s just Pumbaa.
[2:28:11] <+Dresdran> Or do the Japanese find him hilarious?
[2:28:15] <@dcn2049> Nomura hates fat people confirmed
[2:28:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> If Mario Kart has teach me something is that weight means higher to speed.
[2:28:21] <LunarRemix> Japan has a thing for hating more than usual fat people
[2:28:31] <oshkeet41> Oh im sure they genuinely like Wedge
[2:28:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> top speed*
[2:28:36] <oshkeet41> doesnt mean he isnt comic relief
[2:28:53] <+PleasantLee> you switch to operator mode if you dodge roll
[2:28:59] <overkrustice> I think the stance change is pretty clear
[2:29:28] <%JailShmixRemix> Wedge isn't even that fat
[2:29:42] <+PleasantLee> ok
[2:29:45] <overkrustice> He is though?
[2:29:46] <sadboy_otoroshi> The guy is bulking.
[2:29:46] <%caramello_man> no one else is as fat as wedge
[2:29:51] <+PleasantLee> I have to look up who wedges VA is
[2:29:52] <+ragerunner2020> ragerunner2020 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:30:05] <CyberDingus> Those things have BOLTERS
[2:30:05] <%JailShmixRemix> Wedges VA is Matt L jones
[2:30:07] <antaresprt> Wedge sounds like that dude from Megas XLR
[2:30:12] <LunarRemix> Heideigger is just as if not more and he's got the whole daddy thing going on
[2:30:16] <%JailShmixRemix> @PleasantLee
[2:30:16] <KaiserMario> LUL Is Wedge the ONLY fat guy in this game?
[2:30:28] <xstormyone> im starting to feel like this might be the worst dialogue nomura has ever done
[2:30:32] <KaiserMario> I don't remember seeing even an NPC like him...
[2:30:38] <+PleasantLee> Matt Jones looks NOTHING like you'd expect
[2:30:40] <law240> maybe save cossslasher
[2:30:41] <$doomp12> @kaisermario palmer should be here, I think
[2:30:42] <$Pantsravaganza> cheerwhal300
[2:30:43] <%ragerunner2020> Poor Wedge
[2:30:44] <oshkeet41> nah domino and palmer
[2:30:47] <+PleasantLee> lard in the tea
[2:30:55] <eyezehuhh> ah yes, the fat evil
[2:31:04] <@dcn2049> are these supposed to be refurbished steam trains
[2:31:05] <KaiserMario> Oh yeah... oof, totally safe TWO fat guys
[2:31:35] <bestwaifuritsu> nah, the animation just takes slightly longer at each level
[2:31:37] <%JailShmixRemix> I really am starting to think japan doesn't like fat people
[2:32:02] <KaiserMario> What are you talking about? They LOVE sumo
[2:32:15] <overkrustice> @JailShmixRemix Easier to stay healthy in Japan so they do tolerate it less
[2:32:36] <+aspirationdeath> damn yall are sensitive. as if it was some sort of virtue to have lots of fat characters
[2:32:37] <CyberDingus> they eat seaweed and raw fish. You gotta eat a lot to get fat on that.
[2:33:06] <+PleasantLee> GUESS WHAT TIME IT IS
[2:33:08] <oshkeet41> nah, just a lot of processed food
[2:33:12] <LunarRemix> Someone explained it to me that in Japan they see being fat as being ill. Say you go to a doctor and you are overweight, he will tell you like it's an illness that you have to fix urgently.
[2:33:13] <overkrustice> HEREE WE GOOOOO
[2:33:15] <%JailShmixRemix> It's not that, its the fact that the only other fat person is a walking I'M FAT joke every five seconds
[2:33:17] <law240> LUL
[2:33:19] <+xShenzi> YEEEES!
[2:33:20] <sosuke5> IT'S MEE
[2:33:21] <+PleasantLee> yes
[2:33:23] <@dcn2049> oh no
[2:33:23] <+PleasantLee> YES
[2:33:25] <+PleasantLee> the eye roll
[2:33:40] <CyberDingus> Now it is very silent
[2:33:41] <law240> REMEMBER MEEEEE
[2:33:42] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's me, That Guy.

[2:34:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> What a douche
[2:34:03] <@dcn2049> Hell.
[2:34:05] <CyberDingus> Homoerotica!
[2:34:06] <sadboy_otoroshi> Sumo wrestlers aren't fat because of grease food, they eat a lot, a lot of healthy food and actually exercise.
[2:34:06] <%JailShmixRemix> I like his evil goatee
[2:34:06] <devil_may_cum_> Love this guy
[2:34:06] <oshkeet41> honeslt its the most normal looking sword
[2:34:10] <SuperVaderMan> cool anime line
[2:34:12] <bestwaifuritsu> scan him and youll know
[2:34:14] <SilverRoddo> Oh yeah PogChamp PogChamp
[2:34:16] <law240> it's a normal SOLDIER sword
[2:34:17] <+PleasantLee> if you scan him it says he is 3rd
[2:34:17] <Miikaaeeel> that guy's VA is horrible
[2:34:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:34:20] <CursedNobleman> LUL

[2:34:28] <+Neoripo> ASSES
[2:34:37] <devil_may_cum_> 3rd class i think
[2:34:38] <CyberDingus> No plague - when he was to buttsex
[2:34:47] <CyberDingus> wants*
[2:34:48] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath Nah... not really sensitive, just makes one question what kinda world has such low levels of obesity in their population, I guess it's because their world has little food...
[2:34:57] <eyezehuhh> ah yes, the fuck fight
[2:35:00] <law240> 3rd Class
[2:35:03] <+Dresdran> Is he a samurai cowboy?
[2:35:08] <+PleasantLee> I think the C is Class
[2:35:10] <Jrockoni> that looks like Zack's other sword
[2:35:15] <$doomp12> c is short for class
[2:35:20] <+Queenemereldas> i assume tht means 3rd class
[2:35:23] <overkrustice> Now there's a real man. even heals you.
[2:35:23] <%JailShmixRemix> C probably stands for class plague
[2:35:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:35:36] <law240> just 3rd Class
[2:35:40] <Triblade1992> Third Class
[2:35:40] <+Neoripo> 3 class
[2:35:42] <+PleasantLee> we may never know
[2:35:47] <APsaull> oh Roche, I love this idiot
[2:35:54] <%ragerunner2020> I really know nothing about FF7 so forgive me but what class is/was cloud
[2:36:00] <+PleasantLee> I think its Class
[2:36:01] <law240> kay :)
[2:36:03] <KaiserMario> Don't ask questions, consume product
[2:36:04] <SilverRoddo> Sunflower class?
[2:36:06] <%JailShmixRemix> We'll know when we find someone else to scan I guess
[2:36:10] <Huntercd> Does Roche have a mullet?
[2:36:17] <+PleasantLee> if I bump into other soldiers and scan them I'll let you know
[2:36:27] <sadboy_otoroshi> He's just a tryhard.
[2:36:28] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It could, but we have no reason to belive that C is sub level from prior dialogue
[2:36:30] <%caramello_man> @ragerunner2020 first i think
[2:36:32] <LunarRemix> NG+
[2:36:32] <law240> replays
[2:36:34] <+PleasantLee> new game +
[2:36:35] <xstormyone> @ragerunner2020 ive never played it but ive heard he wasnt really a soldier
[2:36:35] <APsaull> new game + maybe?
[2:36:37] <+aspirationdeath> @kaisermario they just eat healthier, in smaller portions and excercise more.
[2:36:38] <+Neoripo> NG+
[2:36:39] <Triblade1992> NG+
[2:36:44] <$doomp12> cloud never said anything about letters, just 1st class
[2:36:45] <Sokumotanaka> OOOOOH so THIS is kunsel!
[2:37:00] <+PleasantLee> you're welcome darling
[2:37:01] <law240> Hard mode too
[2:37:03] <Triblade1992> yeah one of the trophies is "beat the game on hard mode"
[2:37:07] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath Oh, is that so? For 99.9% of the population?
[2:37:18] <oshkeet41> time to squash this Roach
[2:37:37] <law240> it's a counter battle
[2:37:38] <+lethallylactic> Give it to him
[2:37:43] <+PleasantLee> not sure how I feel about Cloud starting the game with fire materia instead of lightning
[2:37:46] <oshkeet41> Revolver Ocelot soundin mofo
[2:37:46] <KaiserMario> And I'm not talking about Japan here, I mean Midgard
[2:37:49] <jacksawjack> Weak to Fire....Too much hair product?
[2:38:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Has crossdress cloud happened yet?
[2:38:11] <CyberDingus> >casually walks around
[2:38:20] <+Dresdran> Nope.
[2:38:20] <LunarRemix> Not yet.
[2:38:26] <+PleasantLee> lock on
[2:38:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Cool guys walk around
[2:38:30] <sadboy_otoroshi> I just thought the he was about to spout slam poetry that wrote on his sword.
[2:38:44] <stratfel112> I love that he thinks so high of himself when he's basically the yamcha of the group
[2:38:52] <sund0wner> Schmacked
[2:39:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Love me some ff7 battle theme
[2:39:19] <+aspirationdeath> @kaisermario midgard is a fictional place dreamt up by japanese dudes. obviously japanese cultural influence is to be expected
[2:39:19] <%JailShmixRemix> That did a ton of damage
[2:39:23] <sund0wner> Noice.
[2:39:25] <+lordericter> Got it memorized?!
[2:39:25] <%Rezca> wow, is he coated in oil?
[2:39:28] <Chaoko99> was there a hell house at some point?
[2:39:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> lots of things are weak to fire really
[2:39:33] <%JailShmixRemix> Too much hair spray
[2:39:39] <cap_bon> Is he dead
[2:39:40] <CyberDingus> Not a single scratch on his clothes
[2:39:41] <bestwaifuritsu> Third Class Soldiers are shitty entry level soldiers, theyre BACKUP for the grunts and do shitty missions. He isnt even Mako powered yet.
[2:39:41] <+PleasantLee> MY COCK IS LIKE A BIKE FOR YOU BERSERKER!
[2:39:42] <+Dresdran> Cloud, kill him.
[2:39:47] <terminusterminal> I wonder if Fira would have just blown him up
[2:39:56] <sund0wner> Oldsmobile bots
[2:39:59] <%caramello_man> is this guy majima? does he keep showing everywhere?
[2:40:02] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath Absolutely, but we can still question it...
[2:40:04] <+ninja_galt> oi
[2:40:14] <$doomp12> when in Roche, as they say
[2:40:16] <overkrustice> LOOK AT HOW HE FLIPS THAT FUCKING BIKE
[2:40:16] <SuperVaderMan> sweepers are both doofy and plausibly threatening
[2:40:17] <+lethallylactic> The absolute madman
[2:40:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kill the guy with the sword
[2:40:19] <Chaoko99> why though
[2:40:21] <%JailShmixRemix> Why
[2:40:24] <overkrustice> My daughter and I agree ROACHE IS AWESOME.
[2:40:24] <CyberDingus> wait WHAT?
[2:40:25] <%JailShmixRemix> Did he do that
[2:40:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> NANDATO
[2:40:33] <sund0wner> Majima-esque
[2:40:37] <cap_bon> WHY
[2:40:38] <+xShenzi> Papa Roche is the real hero
[2:40:40] <sadboy_otoroshi> Wow
[2:40:41] <Chaoko99> Is this Jetstream Sam
[2:40:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Security guys just watching
[2:40:45] <sund0wner> Haha, truth.
[2:40:45] <CyberDingus> Homoerotica goes OUT of control
[2:40:52] <+PleasantLee> "you aided terrorists in their attack on a shinra compound, you're fired"
[2:40:52] <HyperBomb21> lol, you'd kinda have to be
[2:40:56] <SuperVaderMan> oof, that flip looks pretty bad
[2:41:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Okay he fucked up our robots guess we will just look
[2:41:01] <+Dresdran> The mako-infusion process makes everyone into a weirdo.
[2:41:03] <%Rezca> yeah, kinda would like to see more Soldiers
[2:41:06] <professorbic> I think all soliders are weird ass holes
[2:41:07] <Chester_goes_Berserk> the dev team 100% played yakuza
[2:41:09] <sadboy_otoroshi> He just deserted for no reason?
[2:41:10] <+Queenemereldas> that theyre kinda lunatics
[2:41:10] <stratfel112> Oh no! Ed-209!
[2:41:11] <LunarRemix> Zack was normal though.
[2:41:11] <+Dresdran> Damages their minds.
[2:41:12] <SilverRoddo> Stylin’
[2:41:13] <CursedNobleman> fuck you physics! LUL
[2:41:14] <Chaoko99> I like how he's so stunned about Roche that it took him a second to realize that he's being shot at
[2:41:19] <oshkeet41> ther was that random NPC wo talked about mako junkies so yeah, i think theyre implying mako = nutters
[2:41:21] <sund0wner> Long enough
[2:41:22] <+lordericter> you have to be some amount of crazy to survive mega doses of lifestream and battle conditioning
[2:41:34] <Rodzzila> physics has leave the building
[2:41:37] <+PleasantLee> alot of people are being KNOCKED OUT for her to steal some explosives

[2:42:03] <stratfel112> How are they accurate firing chains but not bullets?

[2:42:15] <Chaoko99> He's not there yet.
[2:42:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pat loves roaches
[2:42:18] <Guardiansaiyan> @heartlesshealer I am SURE he has mods
[2:42:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[2:42:22] <reinbachthe3rd> Eli, Roche is cool.
[2:42:24] <@dcn2049> jesus the time outs
[2:42:26] <+aspirationdeath> @kaisermario the writing in jrpgs has always been tropey. tropes are all over most of japanese media consumed by the west. seems silly to take particular issue with some 1 dimensional fat character.
[2:42:27] <getinthetent> raid SUCKA
[2:42:34] <+PanicSwytch> RAID
[2:42:37] <overkrustice> THis guy hate roache, sick him.
[2:42:39] <arkv01> in before crisis
[2:42:40] <coffeeabomination> Roche is the coolest loser i've seen so far this game.
[2:42:41] <+Remery_> Roche just needs to scream about pizza to become Dante
[2:42:42] <heartlesshealer> @Guardiansaiyan I'm sure too, but we all get dumb when we're excited
[2:42:43] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Ah, fake AVALANCHE
[2:42:43] <+CelioHogane> On the Zack prequel
[2:42:44] <Triblade1992> Before Crisisi
[2:42:45] <law240> cause it makes sense
[2:42:45] <+cvp5127> in the phone game
[2:42:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Terrorists and terrorist problems
[2:42:47] <+toastybites> Before Crisis
[2:42:50] <+Dresdran> Why would Avalanche be more than a couple people?
[2:42:50] <+coffincomrade> Roche is cringe
[2:42:53] <Tha_Mik> Another game nobody played
[2:42:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> TOO EXTREME
[2:42:54] <SoFarFetched> @Guardiansaiyan unfortunately one mod and nightbot
[2:43:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> I lean you killed civilians
[2:43:05] <j0ustar> Before Crisis and it's hinted in Cosmo Canyon in the original that avalanche is way larger
[2:43:06] <+Dresdran> It is setting in.
[2:43:07] <asurite_warrior> They said that there was a few in the old games but they never showed them.
[2:43:08] <TalisKanju> Why would Cloud know or care?
[2:43:09] <overkrustice> @coffincomrade Your taste is cringe
[2:43:09] <CyberDingus> this is getting Deus Ex
[2:43:13] <YakumoYomi> SWAT Cats is rad, though
[2:43:22] <Chaoko99> Which is to say, this versus literally one sentence
[2:43:24] <+king_wragles> I STILL don't understand all that Wootai shit
[2:43:26] <Chaoko99> Wedge got chained up
[2:43:26] <asurite_warrior> Old guard saved them
[2:43:30] <arkv01> wedge got captured is now a booty slave
[2:43:31] <+coffincomrade> @overkrustice but I'm right ~
[2:43:31] <JumbleJams> what chapter is this
[2:43:33] <asurite_warrior> Damn plague
[2:43:33] <SuperVaderMan> Other avalanche dudes helped him up
[2:43:33] <%Rezca> Unless those chains dug deep into his flesh, I do not know
[2:43:34] <+sourceofall> because if there aren't more than 1 it isn't a cell?
[2:43:36] <+Bane_Kaikyo> hims booty got bit by doge
[2:43:36] <zombie_goasts> He had a heart attack
[2:43:37] <coffeeabomination> His butt was bit
[2:43:40] <reinbachthe3rd> He got shot in the ass like Forrest Gump.
[2:43:40] <CyberDingus> Wedge is a good boy! He would never vore enemies!
[2:43:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> The one who eats
[2:43:41] <+king_wragles> @PlagueOfGripes he got squeezed so hard his belly ate his lungs
[2:43:42] <+polypolipauli> wedge is detained by pp inspector
[2:43:43] <oshkeet41> Wedge secret reveal is to be the Blue Mage
[2:43:45] <derap41> Wedge is a lot deepe r than that
[2:43:45] <oshkeet41> casts devour
[2:43:46] <asurite_warrior> Going a little kindergarden
[2:43:47] <xstormyone> wedge is a beastars villain
[2:43:47] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> They had to expand AVALANCHE since its apparent that 5-8 dudes opposing a multinational corporation only makes sense when you're 8
[2:43:49] <zombie_goasts> He had a diabetes attack
[2:43:51] <+xShenzi> He eats and he's jolly
[2:43:53] <Fancycuffs> Eating is frowned upon in Japan
[2:43:53] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath Oh man... don't make me go there... I have way too many gripes with how japanese authors use their tropes... I went off for some 4h complaining to a friend of mine about FUCKING BATHHOUSE EPISODES
[2:43:57] <+ninja_galt> the soldiers are going to WEDGE his cheeks open and have their way
[2:43:57] <bestwaifuritsu> There always were other branches of Avalanche, it wasnt Barrets team that tried to assassinate President Shinra before the events of 7. They just never elaborated on it.
[2:44:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> No
[2:44:04] <YakumoYomi> "LOL Fat man eats"
[2:44:07] <derap41> Oh how little you know
[2:44:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wedge only eats
[2:44:09] <zombie_goasts> He farted to death
[2:44:10] <+Neoripo> just wait
[2:44:12] <+Bane_Kaikyo> SLUM THOT!!
[2:44:19] <YakumoYomi> No Way Friendo
[2:44:20] <+PleasantLee> I would help Jessie get rid of a body
[2:44:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hi girl who ks gonna die in a really sad way
[2:44:24] <Chaoko99> I suppose it would explain the events currently undergoing better @Justin_k_killed_a_woman LET'S SECTOR SEVEN 8 PEOPLE
[2:44:29] <+polypolipauli> when wedge is not on screen ppl should ask, "where's wedge?!"
[2:44:34] <aidoru_jam> They seriously just dumped Wedge there
[2:44:37] <CursedNobleman> NWF
[2:44:39] <arkv01> I still don't get why they dump him like that
[2:44:44] <+cvp5127> no only fat
[2:44:47] <arkv01> why not take him home and use his butt?
[2:44:48] <+Tyonidus> atpSpiner atpSpiner atpSpiner I legitimately hate how they handled his character, as a fat man I am appaled.
[2:44:49] <+xShenzi> That truck would have imploded upon colliding with Wedge's mighty frame
[2:44:50] <zombie_goasts> Its how fat people fall
[2:44:52] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> The truck hits Wedge and just launches into the air
[2:44:52] <CyberDingus> >has grenades but never uses them
[2:44:54] <+ninja_galt> wedge is badger from breaking bad. thats his defining characteristic
[2:44:54] <CyberDingus> why?!
[2:44:58] <mrjplays2k9> this stream is boring, theres not enough talk of paiges vagina
[2:45:00] <law240> wait

[2:46:18] <zombie_goasts> Time jannies
[2:46:20] <kuzokai> what about roche
[2:46:24] <Fancycuffs> Big sword, bigger ego
[2:46:26] <+Neoripo> Timecop ghosts

[2:46:27] <bestwaifuritsu> at least Genesis isnt in it.
[2:46:32] <JumbleJams> gotta double-down plague
[2:46:36] <Johnmaddened> Loss ghosts
[2:46:37] <+PleasantLee> I'm really enjoying it so far. but I know the time ghosts are gonna flip my shit at some point
[2:46:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> But babies don't have souls, we all know that.
[2:46:41] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> Time jannies
[2:46:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Really the security guys dont know their faces
[2:46:46] <aidoru_jam> Just ignore the terrorists walking by
[2:46:48] <Chaoko99> we could make a detour
[2:46:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> GTFO
[2:46:55] <+xShenzi> That just makes it less suspicious
[2:46:58] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath fucking bath house and those damned hot springs GARBAGE... God, see what you did??? I'm fuming here...
[2:47:00] <zombie_goasts> History Nggaz
[2:47:00] <TalisKanju> Just ignore the guy with the HUGE SWORD on his back
[2:47:11] <overkrustice> The ghosts are the physical embodiment of complaining fans
[2:47:20] <%JailShmixRemix> She's my next door neighbor
[2:47:29] <+PleasantLee> Jessies mother still thinks shes an actress even though she came to dinner wearing armour and has a gun and wearing matching terrorist bandanas with her terrorist friends
[2:47:31] <CaptHat211> Wedge's run is somethng special
[2:47:33] <tolloponik> time ghost would stop them
[2:47:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hi Jessie Its gonna be really sad when they kill you for the feels
[2:47:38] <mrjplays2k9> the ghosts might as well be saying REEEEEE 1:1 REMAKE
[2:47:41] <SuperVaderMan> Yes, I do desire the pie
[2:47:44] <CyberDingus> The THOT smells LIE
[2:47:47] <%caramello_man> wedge has shit in his pants
[2:47:52] <Chaoko99> I love how dumb it is tbh
[2:47:52] <HyperBomb21> @zombie_goasts I got perma-banned from Pat's stream-chat because I said "time jannies
[2:47:52] <+aspirationdeath> @kaisermario if you dont like cliches most anime and jrpgs are untouchable. largely why i dont consume much of it
[2:47:54] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Chou Genki Awesome-da!
[2:47:58] <aidoru_jam> Don't worry all that equipment was just props for her next play Kappa
[2:48:01] <oshkeet41> honestly i thought the dementor lokin fucks were those cloak dudes
[2:48:09] <CaptHat211> Try running like Wedge.
[2:48:10] <sad_toast_> "the girl with the anatomically correct breast plate?? never seen her..."
[2:48:20] <+Neoripo> Materia behind you
[2:48:21] <law240> You have to let the pawns set things on motion like come on you know they were plotting from the first mission
[2:48:27] <+PanicSwytch> MATERIA BEHIND U
[2:48:33] <Sokumotanaka> It's in line of ff7 tbh
[2:48:40] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> They're also clearly protagonist characters
[2:48:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Anatomically correct breastplate gives her more protection
[2:48:53] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I sure love being a Phantom Theif
[2:48:53] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Even the other terrorists dont dress like this
[2:48:54] <oshkeet41> i mean they also literally go around with bandoliers and grenades on them
[2:48:57] <law240> Yeah and the KKK are still around
[2:48:58] <+SaphronBlackbourne> *Thief
[2:49:01] <+MisterRockett> They might change the reason they drop the plate on them.
[2:49:03] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Get ready for some Point Break shit!
[2:49:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah it aint woman

[2:49:24] <law240> You missed a revive materia
[2:49:25] <+MisterRockett> Remember, Avalanche is bigger than our crew in this game.
[2:49:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> TOP GUN
[2:49:31] <CaptHat211> THe WedgeXCloud fans are losing it
[2:49:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> I HAVE A NEED
[2:49:34] <oshkeet41> ....missed an opportunity not strapping Jessie to Cloud
[2:49:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> A NEED FOR SPEED
[2:49:46] <overkrustice> But I want to ride the bike MORE
[2:49:47] <sad_toast_> music sounds like they just one this big game in 1987
[2:49:47] <+Dresdran> God.
[2:49:49] <mrjplays2k9> jesse is the one wearing the strap
[2:49:50] <+PleasantLee> D

[2:49:59] <CyberDingus> JESSIE NOT NOW
[2:50:00] <+PleasantLee> I love Jessie
[2:50:00] <Rada150> to much japanese body language
[2:50:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nah she wants dick

[2:50:04] <+PanicSwytch> Sure
[2:50:04] <Huntercd> The thirst
[2:50:05] <+Bane_Kaikyo> SLUM THOT
[2:50:05] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> ST ELMO'S FIRE!
[2:50:06] <vonmaultke> She wants the D so bad
[2:50:06] <+Tyonidus> LMFAO
[2:50:10] <Chaoko99> HA
[2:50:14] <+Dresdran> Wedge destroyed.
[2:50:16] <CyberDingus> She plans to ride that dick.
[2:50:16] <wolftundra> I am liking Jessie so far
[2:50:21] <%JailShmixRemix> She's going to give cloud a new sword!
[2:50:25] <mrjplays2k9> shes gonna show him her form fitted vagina armor
[2:50:25] <+lordericter> just don't pull the chute, wedge would break the fall
[2:50:33] <Chaoko99> it is
[2:50:34] <+Eddy21forsaken> the "normal" kind of summoning material
[2:50:35] <overkrustice> it is fun
[2:50:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is wedge fat tho?
[2:50:36] <TalisKanju> Jessie wants the Deathblow Materia
[2:50:36] <HyperBomb21> It is
[2:50:37] <derap41> Don't you dare talk ill about my boy Wedge
[2:50:39] <TG_Cid11> she is going to give him the clap
[2:50:41] <+sourceofall> I think the idea is that they DO know, they are just keeping you around as convenient reasons to lock down whatever they want without anyone protesting
[2:50:43] <sadboy_otoroshi> Cloud at least could use a double bass case to hide his sword you know.
[2:50:47] <+UnwoundCaesar70> he's fat did you know his motivation is food
[2:50:47] <CyberDingus> You did fine, fatman.
[2:50:47] <HyperBomb21> I though he grabbed clouds ass for a second
[2:50:48] <sad_toast_> she's got young charlie sheen on her back but noooo I want the girly boy 😁
[2:50:49] <CaptHat211> Don't go there, Eli
[2:50:49] <overkrustice> Should have been clouds hand
[2:50:49] <CyberDingus> You were good.
[2:50:50] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath The problem is I consume way too much of it to the point I start seeing just the repeat tropes, and there are way too many of them in EVERY piece of media... Oh it kills me!
[2:50:53] <mrjplays2k9> real life summoning materia is just cum
[2:50:54] <+HawkGoggles2> That was the plan.
[2:50:56] <aidoru_jam> They got a taste of it at least
[2:50:59] <ohyouwouldntbelieveme> well marbled
[2:51:01] <%caramello_man> "boy cloud, you really did a number on my ass"
[2:51:04] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah he's succulent >:3
[2:51:05] <%Rezca> dogs like eating ass, I will be honest
[2:51:08] <JumbleJams> for a second i thought that was cloud's hand on his ass
[2:51:11] <Chaoko99> man, all would take is for someone to look up.
[2:51:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> Mah aess
[2:51:13] <+Dresdran> God.
[2:51:14] <%JailShmixRemix> YAY
[2:51:15] <heartlesshealer> loving this 80's-ass music
[2:51:18] <law240> me too :)
[2:51:21] <+Dresdran> The tone.
[2:51:22] <Fredcome2bed> SeemsGood
[2:51:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> This girl is gonna die so goddamn hard
[2:51:25] <CyberDingus> Jessie pls, contain yourself!
[2:51:27] <@dcn2049> There are no innocents
[2:51:31] <TalisKanju> Being in a coma = dead
[2:51:32] <sad_toast_> mass destruction HOOORAYY!
[2:51:32] <+whiskey_wolfe_> They have no CHOICE Plague!
[2:51:32] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "The only way I can feel alive anymore is through carnage!"
[2:51:33] <law240> lul
[2:51:35] <HyperBomb21> lol
[2:51:35] <wolftundra> This feels like credits should start rrolling
[2:51:36] <CaptHat211> YAY TERRORISM
[2:51:38] <Chaoko99> Why did the choose the BRIGHT RED CHUTES, imagine just having someone look up and go "HEY THERE THEY ARE" and it's just a game of skeet at that point.
[2:51:41] <+Dresdran> How many red flags can you raise in the cutscenes?
[2:51:43] <tiger_guard> since how long has he been playing? :O
[2:51:46] <overkrustice> They aren't innocents they are complacent in murder of the planet
[2:51:47] <sadboy_otoroshi> The term is Voluptuous Plage
[2:51:54] <SHLD_b> will bombing ppl bring your hair back to life??
[2:51:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> REALLY
[2:52:03] <@dcn2049> What the hell
[2:52:04] <sad_toast_> they wanted to cap it off like and Anime Arch
[2:52:06] <Chaoko99> fucking igor pose
[2:52:11] <+PleasantLee> he admires Cloud so much
[2:52:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> You did a number on my butt cloud
[2:52:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:52:19] <mrjplays2k9> wedge isnt a person
[2:52:21] <JumbleJams> he's got a man crush
[2:52:22] <$doomp12> you think the ghost thing was bad before? oh the bitching yet to be bitched.
[2:52:24] <CyberDingus> I feel bad for the fatguy
[2:52:25] <+PleasantLee> "Cloud, if I eat you....could I become you?"
[2:52:27] <oshkeet41> the 2d anime posing with the hyperrealistic 3d models feels v odd
[2:52:31] <HyperBomb21> Wedge is trying his best
[2:52:31] <overkrustice> Sometimes people are just jokes
[2:52:36] <sad_toast_> "I'm fat and my butt hurts!!" character development
[2:52:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He's a grown man wearing jorts and a baseball cap.
[2:52:41] <@dcn2049> Why haven't you killed him yet
[2:52:49] <JumbleJams> hi chad
[2:52:50] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @plagueofgripes his skill is eating
[2:52:51] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's literally him and John Cena doing that.
[2:52:54] <Fancycuffs> Is that kid Hope?
[2:52:57] <+silvery_cricket> HE'S FAT
[2:53:00] <HyperBomb21> "Chad:ley
[2:53:01] <+PleasantLee> still cant tell if the thing on his shoulder is a well trained butterfly or a bow
[2:53:06] <HyperBomb21> """Chad"""ley
[2:53:13] <oshkeet41> Jorts and a baseball cap, by Nomura standards, is p reserved
[2:53:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> You hate Chadley cause he is a Chad
[2:53:15] <overkrustice> Why do we hate chadley?
[2:53:17] <+arancet> chaldey needs to die, horribly
[2:53:19] <vonmaultke> That kid is Hope from FF13, He's 9S from Nier
[2:53:19] <ohyouwouldntbelieveme> It's the Google Glass. sets you on edge
[2:53:20] <CaptHat211> If I was Wedge I'd wear a breastplate. No joke, but that gut is too much of a target.
[2:53:21] <terminusterminal> But he is the Great Devourer
[2:53:22] <Chaoko99> who is chadley?
[2:53:24] <Fredcome2bed> At least he's not fat SeemsGood
[2:53:25] <%caramello_man> any other name woulda been fine, but fucking "chadley"
[2:53:27] <oshkeet41> Chadley gives me unfortunate Chocolina vibes
[2:53:32] <vonmaultke> He is a shitty japanese white haired trope
[2:53:36] <sadboy_otoroshi> That could qualify as abuse if he's not really aware of his actions.
[2:53:41] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Jorts at least kinda make sense if you're running a lot, no cuffs to get caught on all that slum wreckage
[2:53:42] <mrjplays2k9> hes a simp for jessie as well
[2:53:48] <TalisKanju> Chadley's concept is that he has two names horribly mashed together
[2:53:54] <sad_toast_> NO BOYS ALOUD 😤
[2:54:03] <CyberDingus> no simps allowed!
[2:54:05] <+PleasantLee> GO IN
[2:54:09] <@dcn2049> this body language
[2:54:09] <sund0wner> Sounds like Josh Gad with laryngitis
[2:54:11] <+coffincomrade> Wedge when did you get caught
[2:54:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gossip
[2:54:13] <+PleasantLee> I bet the girls let Wedge in
[2:54:14] <oshkeet41> "Dont go into the lesbian dormitory Cloud, they'll think you're a hot butch"
[2:54:18] <sad_toast_> "actress"
[2:54:18] <+whiskey_wolfe_> SLUM THOT

[3:00:40] <%JailShmixRemix> He has to clean his place up
[3:00:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> SWEEP THE DIRT

[3:00:50] <+Typhaeon> Gotta get the dirty dirt out, and just leave the clean durt on his doorstep
[3:00:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE DIRT CAN BE CLEANER
[3:00:53] <+walternatorz> avalanche spy code signals
[3:00:53] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He's THINKING

[3:00:58] <TalisKanju> @arkv01 Phone Jessie WHILE Cloud is giving Tifa the whatfor
[3:00:58] <KaiserMario> The attention to detail in this game is AMAZING
[3:00:58] <@dcn2049> He doesn't know how to be normal
[3:01:00] <FinalAce12> is he pat?
[3:01:03] <hcsarg1986> He's
[3:01:04] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> he needs to have that dirt clean
[3:01:07] <sad_toast_> he's having a panic attack shut up
[3:01:08] <Triblade1992> Poor Biggs
[3:01:17] <catalystoffire> In New York, there are weirdos who do this.
[3:01:20] <TalisKanju> You saw him survive the jump, Biggs
[3:01:25] <mrjplays2k9> i would be embarrassed if someone found me like that
[3:01:32] <heartlesshealer> Maybe keeping the flammable garbage in the dirt away from his house?
[3:01:40] <CaptHat211> "I wanted to be partnered w/ Wedge"
[3:01:40] <mrjplays2k9> so biggs is autism
[3:01:45] <overkrustice> There's good dirt and bad, trash filled dirt
[3:01:49] <arkv01> biggs is... a simp?
[3:01:52] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "Need to clean this dirt just like I'll clean the earth of Shinra"
[3:01:59] <%JailShmixRemix> yet
[3:01:59] <sad_toast_> we've all done that at a job tho.. nothing to do so you pretend to sweep
[3:02:04] <LunarRemix> He overthinks stuff. That's his character trait.
[3:02:06] <CaptHat211> Drink some water, you thirsty dope
[3:02:07] <+TDotGoat> have to aerate that dirt
[3:02:11] <asurite_warrior> wonder if the story is gonna stay the same there
[3:02:15] <oshkeet41> i think biggs and jess are just old/neverquiteflames who are just bros now tbh
[3:02:20] <HyperBomb21> My neighbor rakes dirt around his yard to get rid of sharp objets
[3:02:22] <+PleasantLee> too far
[3:02:24] <KaiserMario> Next to the clicnic
[3:02:28] <reinbachthe3rd> That's Biggs' 35 square feet of dirt. He wants it clean.
[3:02:31] <oshkeet41> not everythin about bonin'
[3:02:31] <+PleasantLee> no
[3:02:32] <+PleasantLee> wtf
[3:02:40] <sad_toast_> he live on the corner of Idont and Care
[3:02:40] <+Dresdran> You need a nice map.
[3:02:42] <+Neoripo> Must lowres the textures more
[3:02:44] <+Dresdran> Gives context to places.
[3:02:53] <Victory_Boss> She shrivels up
[3:02:57] <+PleasantLee> she shits on the floor
[3:03:03] <mrjplays2k9> she probably says just kidding or some thot shit
[3:03:05] <HyperBomb21> She shrinks like burning plastic
[3:03:14] <sad_toast_> she shreeks like a banshee
[3:03:17] <asurite_warrior> You simping plauge?
[3:03:17] <DonatelloJose> She actually just explodes
[3:03:24] <+ninja_galt> she commits seppuku
[3:03:24] <law240> GHOST SPOCKY
[3:03:28] <+whiskey_wolfe_> You're good.
[3:03:30] <mrjplays2k9> MAKE SURE TO WASH YOUR BALLS FREQUENTLY
[3:03:32] <CaptHat211> The moon crashes on the 3rd day
[3:03:32] <HyperBomb21> You know whats coming
[3:03:35] <+UnwoundCaesar70> The game ends of you simp for Jessie
[3:03:38] <garrnk> she is disapointed and says basically "you dont like my apporaches? i will have to try a diffrent approach"
[3:03:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> She actually implodes and turn into a blackhole
[3:03:41] <@dcn2049> The bed is a mimic
[3:03:44] <TheLoneUnicorn> Just explodes into confetti
[3:03:44] <+cvp5127> strap in for nomuras wild ride
[3:03:49] <+Solid_Stro> If you sleep, you’ll be asleep
[3:03:50] <+Neoripo> Morgana says to go to sleep already
[3:03:51] <+Eddy21forsaken> she says she has to try harder, then you can hear her cry through the window
[3:04:01] <sad_toast_> I like the burning plastic one too that's fooney
[3:04:04] <+ninja_galt> Game Over. You simped.
[3:04:05] <hcsarg1986> Don't judge her She flirts because she is sad about her dad
[3:04:07] <$doomp12> tommorow in game is gonna be completely bullshit
[3:04:16] <CaptHat211> Biggs was sweeping the dirt b/c he failed to confess his true feelings for Jessie yet again.
[3:04:23] <arkv01> would you like to sleep, or lay in your bed eyes wide open until morning?
[3:04:32] <asurite_warrior> Simping for Sephy
[3:04:35] <fluffy_sauce> ummmmm
[3:04:38] <HyperBomb21> oh boy, here come the canon jannies
[3:04:40] <terminusterminal> Sephiroth is a sleep paralysis demon now
[3:04:44] <law240> LUL megamoLUL
[3:04:49] <Fancycuffs> I hope I don't lift the covers and Sephiroth is there
[3:04:50] <+Solid_Stro> You didn’t reach a high enough affinity with Tifa, Mission Failed. Bad Ending
[3:04:50] <+ninja_galt> sephiroth is a metaphor for clouds big gay
[3:04:54] <arkv01> its REWARD time Kreygasm ??
[3:05:01] <HyperBomb21> Oh its next scene actually
[3:05:06] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Tifa pulls off her face like a mask and its just Sephiroth
[3:05:12] <sad_toast_> I only watch Pat to hear Paige Sass up a storm
[3:05:14] <arkv01> old friend, tight spot, excellent cloud you're learning
[3:05:16] <Naho_Saenoki> The fact that he sleeps with his goshdarn boots on is so... ugh.
[3:05:20] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> And it was him the whole time, even back in the mountains
[3:05:30] <Djinnazz> He IS an Anime Villian
[3:05:32] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Am I incorrect to assume that despite your many gripes, you are enjoying the game so far?
[3:05:38] <asurite_warrior> @PlagueOfGripes What would of made you happy with this.
[3:05:39] <arkv01> hard edge wow, these weapon drops
[3:05:40] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Tifa's Tifas should be bigger. Just SLIGHTLY bigger. But bigger.
[3:05:44] <+PleasantLee> time for bed, later gang, later Eli
[3:05:49] <Chaoko99> WEIRD LAUGHTER
[3:05:50] <+azure22900> Well this not Sef, is more like Cloud having a mental disorder.
[3:05:54] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud had a hard edge to begin with?
[3:05:56] <%Rezca> she is stretching waaay too much
[3:05:57] <overkrustice> They should also jiggle
[3:05:57] <+ninja_galt> Tifa is best girl. Kung fu waifu
[3:06:00] <arkv01> whoa, its pretty late, lemme help you outta those suspenders
[3:06:02] <sad_toast_> brimming with it
[3:06:06] <CaptHat211> Confession: I never found Sephiroth interesting. He has a great theme song.
[3:06:07] <HyperBomb21> Tifa is Cloud's wife
[3:06:08] <TheLoneUnicorn> Sephiroth wasn't an anime villain to begin with Kappa
[3:06:16] <+Venhammer> oh god
[3:06:17] <+cvp5127> what outfit did plague choose?
[3:06:19] <+muzzle_roar24> Plot Ghost rooScream

[3:06:35] <SuperVaderMan> Actual dementors

[3:06:37] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Wow, he wasnt kidding, they really are sleep paralysis demons
[3:06:41] <@dcn2049> that seems contradictory
[3:06:44] <%JailShmixRemix> damn plot condoms

[3:06:59] <@dcn2049> oh hell
[3:06:59] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "These trash bags started appearing all over the palce!"
[3:07:02] <peachteagaming> looks like AHH-SS!
[3:07:02] <asurite_warrior> Is this even the real sephy or is it what cloud has in his mind
[3:07:06] <asurite_warrior> no
[3:07:07] <Djinnazz> no
[3:07:09] <hcsarg1986> What's wrong with Sephiroth?

[3:07:14] <+UnwoundCaesar70> DEMENTORS
[3:07:15] <j0ustar> not really?
[3:07:16] <+whiskey_wolfe_> DEMENTORS
[3:07:17] <+Dresdran> Why couldn't they be like D&D? Have dragons that know when people have fucked with time?
[3:07:17] <Victory_Boss> G-G-G-Ghosts???
[3:07:17] <arkv01> is this a dream? why are the ghosts attacking?
[3:07:18] <sad_toast_> dream AF 🙄
[3:07:20] <TalisKanju> "They're trying to put excessive zippers on our clothes!"
[3:07:21] <fluffy_sauce> ya, i thought this was a dream
[3:07:21] <FunkyWaters> It's the robots from the MAtrix
[3:07:23] <Chaoko99> PUNCH THE GHOSTS
[3:07:23] <LunarRemix> What would you do, really?
[3:07:24] <%JailShmixRemix> This better be a dream
[3:07:26] <+coffincomrade> PUNCH GHOST
[3:07:28] <Fancycuffs> Shoot the ghosts like it's the X-Files
[3:07:29] <KaiserMario> Noooo Riku!!! Don't let the Darkness control you!!!
[3:07:30] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> They're literally sheet ghosts but just black!
[3:07:31] <$doomp12> just call the fucking ghost busters Jesus avalanche
[3:07:33] <+Neoripo> yes
[3:07:33] <AlexDaGr8> why does it look like day for night
[3:07:34] <+Dresdran> Its not, Jail.
[3:07:34] <Johnmaddened> LUL just fight them
[3:07:35] <CaptHat211> I'm getting Matrix Revolution flashbacks!
[3:07:40] <Morsuzado> oh hey I remember advent c hildren
[3:07:46] <arkv01> fuck this, it's time to call in Blade
[3:07:51] <j0ustar> In a world full of monsters, ghosts? Not that weird.
[3:07:52] <cap_bon> why is the sky full of death eaters
[3:07:54] <%ragerunner2020> this is terrible
[3:07:55] <@dcn2049> this is terrible
[3:08:03] <vonmaultke> Who you gonna call
[3:08:05] <overkrustice> THese things represent the gans angry about change, You have to kill them.
[3:08:06] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> Thanks nomura
[3:08:09] <@dcn2049> hahaha
[3:08:10] <+Venhammer> Nomura is a cancer in square enix
[3:08:10] <%JailShmixRemix> Thanks nomura
[3:08:11] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[3:08:11] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LOL
[3:08:12] <overkrustice> *fans
[3:08:14] <+ninja_galt> they gotta pad it out somehow
[3:08:15] <vonmaultke> Ghost busters!
[3:08:16] <Triblade1992> Eh the ghosts are the "we need to dictate this instead of creating branching paths" I think this will disapear more after the first game.
[3:08:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> A bunch of dementors
[3:08:21] <CaptHat211> Nomura's voice is quirky
[3:08:22] <Victory_Boss> Genius Norbungo
[3:08:22] <+illoonar> lol the camera
[3:08:23] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, Nomura ghosts knocked over your camera
[3:08:26] <sad_toast_> I hear the community is calling them Time Yannies? Jannie's?
[3:08:26] <hcsarg1986> But his art is good
[3:08:29] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Goblin Nomura
[3:08:29] <asurite_warrior> OK Plague I'mma duck out hope you enjoy this
[3:08:37] <+Venhammer> As someone who used to like kingdom hearts nomura is an active detriment to Square
[3:08:37] <law240> use MAKO wink wink
[3:08:38] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> oh plague, yo're a marvelous creature
[3:08:43] <+Dresdran> Nomura is a gremlin confirmed.
[3:08:45] <+Neoripo> I think not even KH fans defend Nomura's writting after KH2
[3:08:45] <%JailShmixRemix> Nomura and his continuity condoms
[3:08:48] <+cvp5127> that but in japanese
[3:08:55] <+Dresdran> They keep feeding him after midnight.
[3:09:01] <CaptHat211> It'd be funny if he flailed his arms like that too.
[3:09:14] <antaresprt> Tifa punching these ethereal ghosts is amazing.
[3:09:16] <$doomp12> why does every interview sound the same coming from plague?
[3:09:16] <hcsarg1986> The ghosts are an allegory for the fans
[3:09:23] <+Daniel_Is_I> Ah yes, the ghost-nado
[3:09:24] <sad_toast_> this is totally a friggin dream
[3:09:25] <Triblade1992> Tetsuya Nomura is a quiet but powerful man though Plague.
[3:09:38] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[3:09:39] <vonmaultke> Its a fucking plot ghost tornado LUL it is stupid
[3:09:39] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 Kinda... depends, when he keeps it in his pants and he tones down the zippers and the "edge", his art is mostly fine
[3:09:41] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> The time ghosts, to me at least, present a real difficult question of ethics, in that if they have to make events progress a certain way doesnt mean it was necessary for the world to get its asshole fucked inside out by Jenova and everything related to it?
[3:09:42] <Johnmaddened> LUL this IS stupid
[3:09:44] <jon651> Cloud you are aware TY
[3:09:45] <+Neoripo> Cloud knows
[3:09:47] <CyberDingus> HE IS SELF AWARE
[3:09:47] <%JailShmixRemix> That was intentional
[3:09:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:09:48] <CaptHat211> Cloud has become self-aware
[3:09:53] <AlexDaGr8> THANKS CLOUD LUL
[3:09:56] <+Venhammer> @Neoripo I certainly don't defend, I fucking hate what nomura did with the story in kingdom hearts, especially 3
[3:09:57] <sad_toast_> cloud saw the script
[3:09:59] <%JailShmixRemix> the music is dramatic af though
[3:10:00] <%Rezca> Fira?
[3:10:01] <+DAURAGON_C_MIKADO> Even they know how stupid this is lmao
[3:10:06] <CaptHat211> Cloud, at least this isn't FF13
[3:10:08] <overkrustice> It's fine
[3:10:20] <+illoonar> getting KH3 vibes right now don't know why Kappa
[3:10:22] <cap_bon> wait is that the script floating away in the background
[3:10:22] <+ninja_galt> FF13 was dogshit
[3:10:28] <+Venhammer> @illoonar same
[3:10:29] <$doomp12> cloud is eli's spirit anime.
[3:10:30] <Triblade1992> @cap_bon FF13 is decent. =/
[3:10:30] <+Dresdran> The only justification for this kind of shit is when time travel tears wholes in time and starts fucking things up drastically.
[3:10:31] <Chaoko99> I think in general this game has a bit of the MGS5 issue, what with the explaining of things that.. really don't need explaining as they worked fine on their own
[3:10:34] <sad_toast_> it's ok Sora will come save you soon!!
[3:10:56] <%Rezca> Organization 13 has gotten to new heights
[3:11:00] <%JailShmixRemix> All these heartless have invaded FF7
[3:11:02] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario Yoshitaka Amano's work? I don't think it's bad but it makes everyone look like porcelion dolls.
[3:11:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> how can you stagger a ghost
[3:11:20] <+illoonar> Didn't even played the DLC for KH3 tho, but saw some of that so... yeeeeeaaah
[3:11:22] <sad_toast_> it's now organization 13,000
[3:11:22] <+Venhammer> FF7R is the crossover of Kingdom Hearts and Harry Potter that the fans always wanted
[3:11:22] <KaiserMario> @ninja_galt More like bullshit, rather, dogshit is a bit much
[3:11:29] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Augh, they puff up like a burnt marshmallow when you kill them.
[3:11:41] <TalisKanju> Oh, this turned into Devil May Cry so quickly
[3:11:42] <+cvp5127> retcon ghosts
[3:11:46] <+sourceofall> but the future refuses to change so it's fine
[3:11:50] <overkrustice> So the ghosts are plague
[3:11:57] <+Neoripo> Still prefer Nomura writing over Motomu Toriyama writing. At least Nomura cares about what he is writing
[3:11:58] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, ghost hurricane
[3:12:06] <oshkeet41> are they hiding a loaning screen
[3:12:09] <%Rezca> I'd shop at Dude
[3:12:13] <AlexDaGr8> belldood LUL
[3:12:20] <xstormyone> pull my devil trigger
[3:12:22] <+Daniel_Is_I> Barret is great in this game
[3:12:26] <TalisKanju> They have to be hiding a loading screen
[3:12:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah shoot the ghosts
[3:12:37] <stratfel112> Things are getting pretty Prisoner of Azkaban
[3:12:39] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 No Amano has an art Noveau thing going on, and it's very unique, Nomura is very uninteresting compared to him
[3:12:40] <CaptHat211> Who wrote the FFX novel about Tidus exploding on a beach after mistaking a bomb for a blitzball?
[3:12:40] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo You do realize that Toriyama iis a co director picked by Nomura though?
[3:12:48] <Johnmaddened> the memes are GREAT
[3:12:49] <+Daniel_Is_I> This song's pretty good
[3:12:49] <+Neoripo> I KNOW
[3:12:55] <cap_bon> watched somone trying fight off ghosts with a Klob is something I thought i'd never see
[3:12:55] <sad_toast_> dam I'm all out of ghost bullets!!!
[3:13:07] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @capthat211 Didn't Nomura right that
[3:13:09] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:13:12] <PsychicKirby> So I can safely presume that ghosts were not a part of the original?
[3:13:19] <mrjplays2k9> SO I dont really hate this like some people do, Im starting to know how kingdom hearts fans felt all these years
[3:13:23] <%Rezca> will there even be an All materia?
[3:13:23] <+Neoripo> Why do they keep giving Toriyama power over important things!
[3:13:24] <Djinnazz> npt like this
[3:13:25] <hassanico2> @PsychicKirby only trainyard ghosts
[3:13:34] <oshkeet41> There were weird cloaked fuckos you kept running into but i dont know if these are intended to bethe same guys
[3:13:44] <overkrustice> @PsychicKirby Nah, the ghosts are stand ins for fans that complain about change
[3:13:46] <cap_bon> Apparently the tornado of ghosts isnt worthy of a summoning
[3:13:47] <oshkeet41> you neevr fought em if anything
[3:13:50] <+sourceofall> what about mega-all? remember mega-all?
[3:13:51] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "But how can you fight the future when the present is always dying and the past is already dead?" is a line I expect to spawn from this game.
[3:13:51] <%JailShmixRemix> @Neoripo Toriyama is for dragon ball dekillMay ....
[3:14:02] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo Because he makes Decent FF titles. I still enjoy FF10 and FF13 very much over thtings like FF8, FF12, etc
[3:14:04] <+Daniel_Is_I> Ifrit is scared of ghosts, don't you know?
[3:14:07] <jon651> Look it's the Enigmatic Spectre!!
[3:14:17] <sad_toast_> alarm clock starts going off...
[3:14:19] <+Neoripo> Motomu Toriyama. Guy who created and wanted to bang Lightning
[3:14:23] <PsychicKirby> Alright because I heard a lot of people were upset but I never played the original.
[3:14:27] <tolloponik> your breaking away from the atumus
[3:14:29] <%JailShmixRemix> Ay ok
[3:14:39] <%Rezca> did you scan the Enigmatic spectre?
[3:14:42] <hassanico2> Is that a Gravity spell?
[3:14:43] <%JailShmixRemix> Lighting wasn't THAT bad
[3:14:44] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario I don't think unique by itself is enough to be better Like I said it's not bad but I think Nomura's artwork captures the spirit of the games better.
[3:14:49] <mrjplays2k9> people are upset because its not a 1:1 remake
[3:14:52] <+Daniel_Is_I> Do combo
[3:14:54] <+Neoripo> FF13 is trash, and 10 he did not cowrite
[3:14:54] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo And Kamiya created Bayonetta to be his waifu. What is your point?
[3:14:58] <+cvp5127> shes dps girl
[3:15:08] <sad_toast_> "I'ma punch every ghost in the face!!!
[3:15:19] <CaptHat211> Give Tifa some Nth metal knuckle dusters.
[3:15:25] <+Neoripo> That Kamiya gabe us a character and not a plank of wood
[3:15:34] <mrjplays2k9> people wanted "MEMBER DIS SCENE" in hd and are mad because its not what they got
[3:15:45] <PsychicKirby> @mrjplay2kp I could see that. I reserve judgement until I see more.
[3:15:47] <cap_bon> instead we got ghost tornado
[3:16:00] <overkrustice> I love going up in the air though
[3:16:01] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats the thing, the game IS MEMBER DIS SCENE
[3:16:04] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo So basically you only care about skin deep nonsense instead of character writing? Okay, weird flex but I see otherwise
[3:16:08] <hassanico2> Fights with aerial enemies get very silly looking
[3:16:22] <mrjplays2k9> @JailShmixRemix until its not like right now
[3:16:27] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 I disagree on that point, Amano always enticed my imagination, Nomura is more of a "what you see is what you get", and very anime circa 2003, doesn't do that much for me really...
[3:16:32] <oshkeet41> it works in KH cause among other reasons everyone is cartoony lookin
[3:16:46] <%JailShmixRemix> Right now it's doing something weird, wouldn't call it bad yet
[3:16:46] <%Rezca> nice Shoryuken
[3:16:47] <Valorzard> oh my god you look like your avatar
[3:16:51] <AlexDaGr8> so are barret and jessie just chilling in the back during this?
[3:16:52] <TalisKanju> Aerial battle with Cloud looks fine, with Tifa it looks kind of ridiculous
[3:16:54] <overkrustice> @oshkeet41 It works in DMC and that's realistic looking, it also works here.
[3:17:03] <PsychicKirby> I was one of those people who were way more into Square Ips like Dew Prisim (Threads of Fate USA) and avoided FF.
[3:17:09] <BillieNoMates> Got to keep canon inline
[3:17:09] <+cvp5127> begone thot
[3:17:11] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Her thottiness disrupts the timestream
[3:17:15] <+Neoripo> Lightning has no character. Bayo has a defined character, even if over the top
[3:17:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes I like to call them Scripts
[3:17:19] <powerprotoman> they hit her with their limit "the crippler"
[3:17:20] <+Daniel_Is_I> Has Plague been spoiled?
[3:17:25] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> literally thot begot
[3:17:26] <terminusterminal> Wait a minute, all they wanted was to kill Jessie?
[3:17:28] <+shootbang_exe> oh boy the retcon dementors are here'
[3:17:33] <Run44forrest> why do the ghosts look like dicks
[3:17:34] <TalisKanju> Ok, this is kind of stupid
[3:17:36] <+BigCoffee> @PlagueOfGripes Jessie needed to get hurt in the original story, now she wasnt, so this was corrected
[3:17:46] <arkv01> weird shit huh
[3:17:52] <professorbic> yeah waht coffee siad
[3:17:52] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario Fair enough but I think there is something to be said for more simplistic artwork
[3:17:55] <+Dresdran> I really can't stand time travel.
[3:17:59] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo if she had no character, nobody would have cared for her like how she's a Japanese fan favorite. Try looking at Lunafreya or Ashe for an example of bad female characters with no characterization
[3:18:01] <+xShenzi> explanation: Sum weird shit
[3:18:08] <stratfel112> Gettin a Duke nukem vibe from barret
[3:18:12] <Chaoko99> wELP I basically just poured water straight into the USB my tablet usually plugs into.
[3:18:14] <Chaoko99> F.
[3:18:17] <arkv01> jfc wedge
[3:18:22] <sad_toast_> she got bit .. she's going to slowly turn into a plot ghost
[3:18:24] <SuperVaderMan> So did the civilians just see avalanche flailing about, because the ghosts are usually supposed to be invisible
[3:18:25] <Fancycuffs> Chop the leg so it doesn't spread
[3:18:25] <powerprotoman> much like a horse her legs are broken and now we need to put her down
[3:18:27] <Shardlab> "I don't remember this." Remake instead of Remaster.
[3:18:27] <overkrustice> @Dresdran This game doesn't really do time travel, more future visions.
[3:18:28] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Wedge why werent you helping them fight the ghosts?
[3:18:28] <%Rezca> bum leg, time to put ol' Jesse down
[3:18:31] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> he had to carry her like a potato sack
[3:18:32] <arkv01> guess you'll have to lick it til its better wedge
[3:18:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> They really wants us to care for this girl that cleqrly has death written all over her
[3:18:34] <mrjplays2k9> I dont see this as time travel I see it as defying fate being the main theme of the game
[3:18:40] <TalisKanju> The ghosts tried to prevent her from making a bomb? What?
[3:18:41] <AlexDaGr8> I'm fine! *leg explodes*
[3:18:44] <ZigZagaroo> Sorry Jessie but this game is written by Nomura
[3:18:46] <snowmanse> They did it to force them to have to bring Cloud
[3:18:48] <+Dresdran> Hasn't a certain someone travelled?
[3:18:49] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> why
[3:18:51] <cap_bon> Biggs was busy sweeping dirt during all this
[3:18:59] <+BigCoffee> In the original she was hurt, now she wasnt, plot is forced back on the rails
[3:18:59] <+Neoripo> JP cares about Lightning BC she is female Advent children Cloud for those who don't remember Cloud
[3:19:01] <+arancet> if she NEEDED to be hurt in the OG why wasnt she just hurt like in OG
[3:19:01] <law240> on going injury
[3:19:05] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 There is for sure!
[3:19:06] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yup. This is SO needless.
[3:19:10] <SuperVaderMan> Re-scripting ghosts LUL
[3:19:10] <arkv01> this feels like a circuitous excuse to get the time ghosts doing stuff
[3:19:11] <mrjplays2k9> they are doing the opposite of rescripting sequences
[3:19:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> I like to name the Time ghosts "Scripts" until they get an offical name
[3:19:20] <sosuke5> such a lust for terrorism
[3:19:22] <%Rezca> Isn't that money coming out of Marlene's college fund?
[3:19:27] <TalisKanju> Ok THAT is some stupid garbage
[3:19:27] <+BigCoffee> @doc_ock_rokc Time Janitors
[3:19:29] <BillieNoMates> I WILL EAT THEM ALL
[3:19:32] <mrjplays2k9> they are making sure everything goes how the script is
[3:19:34] <Chaoko99> Can't accidentally create a moveset for Wedge.
[3:19:34] <AlexDaGr8> maybe Barret knows he's going to stiff him later?
[3:19:36] <kuzokai> but we haven't even met red 13 yet
[3:19:43] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "Your gigantic ass can shield Jessie from future time ghost attacks"
[3:19:44] <%JailShmixRemix> You're kidding
[3:19:44] <sad_toast_> "no wedge.. you got a Hole in your Butt"
[3:19:44] <$daveronald> fuck those countries
[3:19:54] <PsychicKirby> I mean I would ask if they ever end up explaining the ghosts, but that's spoilers so don't worry about it.
[3:19:57] <powerprotoman> the continuity condoms need to wrap the changes up fast or else jesse will get time pregnant
[3:19:57] <Run44forrest> nah it still works
[3:19:58] <SuperVaderMan> Imagine being a country that is wrong
[3:19:58] <Chaoko99> YOUUUU
[3:20:02] <overkrustice> up in this hoooo
[3:20:04] <arkv01> we ain't square til we do karaoke of poker face, barret
[3:20:05] <CaptHat211> Crank that
[3:20:07] <+MalekDracarus> yoouuu
[3:20:10] <+coffincomrade> shipping cloud and barret now
[3:20:14] <sad_toast_> wedge is his last name his first name is Potatoe
[3:20:14] <%Rezca> Soulja Boi
[3:20:14] <%zk_nails> SE can edit it so he flips the bird in those countries
[3:20:16] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes The story has been great so far, except for the parts where it takes steep nose dives into being stupid
[3:20:29] <cyberblueneon> since youre canonically not supposed to lose in the original story, why dont the ghosts just prevent you from losing every fight in the game?
[3:20:30] <%JailShmixRemix> LOL
[3:20:30] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> @PlagueOfGripes They are literally Ghost ReWriters
[3:20:31] <arkv01> forget about jessie, tifa's in CRITICAL condition
[3:20:34] <+UnwoundCaesar70> The ghost red the script
[3:20:36] <%Rezca> HA HA HA
[3:20:37] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario Yeah it's always nice to have insightful discussions while still having disagreements
[3:20:38] <fr3shcutcabbage> did you teach yourself art???
[3:20:56] <+Dresdran> Why do people like Nomura?
[3:20:59] <TalisKanju> That jukebox music is awesome
[3:21:00] <overkrustice> What if both the good and the bad is Nomura
[3:21:02] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He injects his own padding and filler.
[3:21:05] <SuperVaderMan> Upside-down S LUL
[3:21:07] <arkv01> it's a reversed N
[3:21:07] <oshkeet41> Nomura = actual Tonberry body
[3:21:10] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[3:21:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> Can you make and S upside down?
[3:21:14] <mrjplays2k9> I still think if no one knew nomura was on the crew for this and it was the same it wouldnt be this big of a deal
[3:21:14] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Gremlin Nomura
[3:21:21] <CaptHat211> Sounds like Rian Johnson
[3:21:24] <TalisKanju> Upside down S looks like an S
[3:21:26] <oshkeet41> instead of DOINKing with a knife its a pen and he kills the plot
[3:21:30] <BillieNoMates> He's a good art director
[3:21:36] <arkv01> apparently people in japan absolutely eat up his stuff though
[3:21:36] <+shootbang_exe> mmmmmyes nomura and nojima, the tag team from hell
[3:21:36] <BillieNoMates> and has a good "vision"
[3:21:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[3:21:46] <berserkfan93> so Nomura is japanese JJ abrams
[3:21:46] <+silvery_cricket> Eh I often feel his character designs are over developed
[3:21:50] <sad_toast_> but he's as creative as a wet napkin
[3:21:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> But muh waifus Plague-Nomura
[3:21:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> @CaptHat211 Rian johnson was never good and doesn't have anything really supporting him beyond his cult of journalists
[3:21:57] <Djinnazz> meh
[3:21:57] <overkrustice> Nah, I like Nomura's story
[3:21:59] <+HawkGoggles2> FF VSXIII and KH3 say otherwise.
[3:22:03] <arkv01> nojimas fine cause he writges some batshit entertaining stuff, but nomura is WEW lad
[3:22:09] <frownystar> I hear you but raise you a ff15
[3:22:11] <+Neoripo> Nomura needs a talented editor
[3:22:12] <sad_toast_> creative as stale white bread
[3:22:14] <xGeneralDOOM> the right garbage Kreygasm
[3:22:15] <vonmaultke> bad fan fiction at that
[3:22:20] <Triblade1992> Sorry Plague, people love Nomura's wild KINO ride. I can tell you a LOT of people like his Kino ride
[3:22:24] <mrjplays2k9> @doc_ock_rokc Knives out, the most highly rated episode of breaking bad and Brick all prove you wrong
[3:22:26] <+BigCoffee> Nomura isn't the writter he's the director
[3:22:35] <Valorzard> wait whats his opinion is there a command for that?
[3:22:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Some peopple want to ride Nomura's wild ride
[3:22:38] <vincerocmm> PIZZA
[3:22:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> This aint Kino fam
[3:22:51] <CyberDingus> Pizza is the code word for Pussy
[3:22:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> You dont know what kino is
[3:22:57] <arkv01> yes, breathe for us tifa...
[3:23:06] <PsychicKirby> It's been very insightful for me being an outsider with no powerful investment.
[3:23:12] <+BigCoffee> The writer for ff7r is actually the original writter, who also worked on 8 and 10
[3:23:15] <sad_toast_> he's all about super unbelievably power bad guys that you can't possibly defeat without love and friendship right?
[3:23:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> @mrjplays2k9 Brick all didn't make money. The breaking bad episode was written by someone else and the best scene was a COMPLETE ACCIDENT and Knives out is highly rated by again his cult
[3:23:41] <+ninja_galt> I enjoyed 8 a lot
[3:23:45] <CaptHat211> @mrjplays2k9 He can only handle his own original stories. He is a hack w/ everything else he has touched.
[3:24:04] <arkv01> yeee rise up my 8 brothers
[3:24:10] <+ninja_galt> triple triad!
[3:24:13] <+HawkGoggles2> It's written like it is.
[3:24:16] <Explodincatz> it sure feels that way
[3:24:31] <+Punishedkaiger> Oh man I love gumbo
[3:24:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> people who like 8 also think 9 is a good game Kappa
[3:24:45] <+ninja_galt> yes
[3:24:47] <PsychicKirby> Did the original game have a unified vision then?
[3:24:50] <Triblade1992> For example, Motomu Toriyama wrote the entire Midgar section and almost turned FF7 original into "Midgar Section: The game"
[3:24:54] <arkv01> 9 is universally beloved and I'm not even a huge fan of it LUL
[3:24:55] <CaptHat211> When I say "original stories" I'm talking about projects that aren't connected to established universes/franchises like SW.
[3:24:56] <sad_toast_> story gulosh
[3:25:15] <adimcorner> they're playing a Smashing Pumpkins cover for the release trailer
[3:25:18] <CaptHat211> It was saved in editing.
[3:25:51] <KaiserMario> Star Wars is VERY applicable to FF, just watch the opening scene for FF XII and it looks like a SW fanfic
[3:25:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> What final fantady was being released in the Deus Ex universe? 47 I think
[3:26:08] <arkv01> they gotta sleep
[3:26:12] <vincerocmm> its uncal lol
[3:26:13] <Explodincatz> he aged overnight
[3:26:14] <BillieNoMates> he slimmed down and grew a beard
[3:26:15] <KaiserMario> @Triblade1992 Honestly, that doesn't sound too bad...
[3:26:16] <+Neoripo> That was Sakaguchi. he wanted FF7 to be a detective kinda game set exclusively in Midgar
[3:26:21] <notanegg8> the kid's future is changing as he dedicates himself to his task
[3:26:21] <oshkeet41> 10 hours in the kid will be level 50 and wielding the pipe to help you in battle
[3:26:31] <+Daniel_Is_I> Avalanche is still a terrorist group
[3:26:40] <+Dresdran> The kid is a summon.
[3:26:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Lucas wrote the first one with edits based on actors and stuff. The rest of the trilogy was written by the directors of the others with input from lucas
[3:26:48] <+ninja_galt> pipe kid is OP
[3:26:50] <KaiserMario> LUL
[3:26:56] <CaptHat211> The problem is that over time people forgot about that editing team they gave all the credit to Lucas and saw no problem w/ him doing 1 draft for the Prequels. Lucas is still a great idea man, but he only works when his ideas are in the hands of people like Dave Filoni and his team.
[3:26:59] <BillieNoMates> Oh Im goddamn sure it was Nomura
[3:26:59] <adimcorner> it was Bullet with Buterfly wings BTW
[3:26:59] <KaiserMario> Here he is!
[3:27:06] <+Daniel_Is_I> Speaking of smelling Nomura
[3:27:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> Avalanche are super terrorist that broadcast themselves openly. How shinra has not squashed em baffles me
[3:27:07] <+BigCoffee> Kazushige Nojima is the FF7r Scenario writer
[3:27:13] <sad_toast_> we don't care the pitch forks are still aimed at him
[3:27:16] <+Neoripo> Motomu Toriyama wrote the events of the Honey Bee inn, and the majority of them got cut for being too extreme
[3:27:19] <AlexDaGr8> there's an actual real character named chadley???? LUL
[3:27:21] <vonmaultke> Nomura's stupid writing is distinctive
[3:27:21] <KaiserMario> Pat loves him, because he is os terrible
[3:27:22] <law240> you haven't done any of his battle intel
[3:27:26] <+arancet> nomuras the director, even if it wasnt his hand doing it its his resopnsibility
[3:27:27] <hcsarg1986> What is he wearing?!
[3:27:28] <adimcorner> is secretly a android?
[3:27:28] <%Rezca> Senpai noticed him
[3:27:38] <cap_bon> how has a kid like that not been mugged in an area like this
[3:27:49] <oshkeet41> i think Chadleys that deliberately/annoying 'funny NPC who shows up everywhere' like the old dude in 10, or Chocolina or Tingle
[3:27:49] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 That's that Nomura classic design at work
[3:27:54] <arkv01> aerith only needs one stick :)
[3:27:56] <sad_toast_> (Eric Andre meme)
[3:28:01] <Triblade1992> @KaiserMario yeah it's another reason I like his number titles. All the major ideas he couldn't do in Midgar Section went into FF10 and to a certain extend FF13
[3:28:02] <AlexDaGr8> if Hell House isn't in this game then no sale
[3:28:03] <silverpoyozo> Cloud already has a pretty good stick for her
[3:28:09] <PsychicKirby> Perhaps I need more exposure to the games, but I always had a feeling that generally the writing in FF wasn't stellar. I'm willing to accept suggestions and recomendations to counter that though.
[3:28:10] <adimcorner> I bet we're going to find out that kid is a Robot Plant
[3:28:13] <catalystoffire> bitches love sticks
[3:28:37] <+Dresdran> I don't think it was fantastic, but the direction was interesting.
[3:28:38] <overkrustice> I love the plot of this game Nomura and all. My real issue is some of the acting of the english VA's
[3:28:44] <arkv01> berry groovy
[3:28:44] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario I don't remember any of the designs being this bad other than Tidus
[3:28:49] <CaptHat211> Whenever Cloud runs it looks like his sword is gonna knick his left heel.
[3:28:56] <BillieNoMates> bottles? You don't drink your well water?
[3:29:03] <arkv01> biggs is sweeping the ground, tifa
[3:29:05] <vonmaultke> FF7's story made sense for the most part but it had big holes in it
[3:29:14] <+Neoripo> FF writing is ok to good. A lot gets lost in translation from 4 onwards
[3:29:19] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 Then you haven't seen enough of it LUL that is 100% his work
[3:29:29] <overkrustice> Is there any point of point of using those channel points? does it actually help anything
[3:29:35] <BillieNoMates> Noone says shit about the guy with a chaingun on his arm
[3:29:36] <arkv01> hide your fucking arm, barret
[3:29:58] <stratfel112> Arm turrets are a local fashion
[3:30:09] <BillieNoMates> Fair enough
[3:30:14] <+ninja_galt> flouride free is the way to be
[3:30:18] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "A reactor! I'll explode it! NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW!"
[3:30:25] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 Have you played The World Ends With You? It's a... weird game, some people love it, some hate it, but that's one of his too
[3:30:36] <BillieNoMates> Just shouting it in the bar
[3:30:41] <BillieNoMates> and everyone heard
[3:30:43] <PsychicKirby> I mean no one is going to pay attention to the chick that dive kicks people, the guy with the gun-atm, and the dude with a sword bigger than his body.
[3:30:44] <mercado94> they send a very angry letter
[3:30:45] <arkv01> so... another scorpion?
[3:30:46] <LunarRemix> Calling cards, posters
[3:30:50] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Do you piss on them so you don't have to go to the bathroom
[3:30:54] <LunarRemix> Probably posters.
[3:30:57] <adimcorner> they write it on a bunch of cans and then litter all over the place
[3:31:05] <overkrustice> I'm sure there are tons of simple explanations so I wouldn't questiosn it.
[3:31:06] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario I will admit the costumes are sometimes off but I still think the characters themselves look decent
[3:31:09] <Valorzard> is there any japanese writers who you do like?
[3:31:10] <AlexDaGr8> phantom thief-style calling card sent to the reactor
[3:31:28] <MSGlukles> Not to the company, the reactor specifically
[3:31:28] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "might"
[3:31:33] <BillieNoMates> "might stand out"
[3:31:37] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Revenge and Cloud dick
[3:31:41] <Explodincatz> very
[3:31:43] <BillieNoMates> "Im the one black guy in Midgar"
[3:31:47] <PsychicKirby> Barett you stand out wherever you go.
[3:31:48] <thepiefoot> They are MCs, they have to stand out Kappa
[3:31:55] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[3:31:58] <vincerocmm> LOOK ASS
[3:31:58] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's the only black man in Midgar, and he has a machine-gun arm.
[3:31:59] <overkrustice> Yeah they should have more people with swords
[3:32:00] <+chattychocobo> LUL
[3:32:07] <arkv01> shhh 1990s logic
[3:32:07] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 There's something to be said about the 3d artists and animators, they do a lot of the work to makes his art look good! So they deserve some credit for that too
[3:32:11] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @billienomates not only that but has a fucking minigun as a hand
[3:32:12] <adimcorner> a soldier, a preacher and waitress walk onto a train
[3:32:12] <AlexDaGr8> everyone will be looking, but hot girls get away with anything
[3:32:19] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[3:32:20] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Yeah Cloud is literally dressed like someone on the Shinra payroll, how mnay guys could that be who aren't enlisted"
[3:32:22] <jon651> IT IS
[3:32:24] <%JailShmixRemix> LUL
[3:32:24] <arkv01> LUL
[3:32:26] <mercado94> nah this one is hotter
[3:32:29] <+chattychocobo> holy shit it is
[3:32:30] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[3:32:32] <silverpoyozo> LUL LUL LUL
[3:32:33] <arkv01> the tornado is all you need to know
[3:32:33] <AlexDaGr8> is that the guy from mulan next to her????
[3:32:37] <thepiefoot> The "Spirits Within is underrated" girl
[3:32:39] <jon651> lol
[3:32:41] <KaiserMario> Look at these Sonic 06 people
[3:32:57] <CyberDingus> she has what in her where?
[3:33:04] <vonmaultke> no hobo? FeelsBadMan
[3:33:17] <arkv01> holy shit i NEVER knew that
[3:33:19] <thepiefoot> I didn't knew that, i never stopped to talk to people
[3:33:20] <+Neoripo> no hobo, nor thief
[3:33:20] <+ninja_galt> murder hobo
[3:33:25] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Literal hobo.
[3:33:38] <PsychicKirby> Maybe thought it was too much? idk
[3:33:38] <+ninja_galt> hobo with a shotgun
[3:33:43] <BillieNoMates> "Barret is bullying random people"
[3:33:51] <AlexDaGr8> of course plague feels a kinship with the train hobo
[3:34:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:34:18] <arkv01> I dunno, tifa looks like she's from wutai tbh
[3:34:20] <+ninja_galt> Barret is spreading subversive avalanche propaganda among the proletariat
[3:34:23] <%Rezca> No Wutai in Midgar
[3:34:26] <reiface08> somewhat asian ?
[3:34:27] <notanegg8> we're all hobos on the train of life
[3:34:29] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario True but I still think the basic character sketchs look good if a bit much Although I will admit I'm not a professional artist I imagine you know a lot more about then me
[3:34:32] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> They could still be bigoted against Wutai culture
[3:34:39] <BillieNoMates> Well Barret is the only black guy in the world. He's more like a reverse zebra than an ethnic group
[3:34:41] <thepiefoot> Tifa's waist to bust ratio is insane
[3:34:48] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Though if that happens it would probably just be Shinra members
[3:34:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:34:56] <arkv01> @thepiefoot she's trained her whole life to support those honkers
[3:35:03] <Victory_Boss> Should we be worried about the dude with a gun for an arm?
[3:35:05] <+Neoripo> Materia
[3:35:08] <SuperVaderMan> Middle Manager-san PogChamp
[3:35:08] <thepiefoot> @arkv01 Not complaints from me LUL
[3:35:11] <AlexDaGr8> "SOLDIERs are trained to ejaculate quickly, not my fault"
[3:35:13] <overkrustice> Being from soldier would probably define you a lot
[3:35:20] <MSGlukles> What's with this guy
[3:35:21] <thepiefoot> Look at this salary man LUL
[3:35:23] <oshkeet41> he still dont get a name tho
[3:35:24] <stratfel112> This dude has balls when you think about it
[3:35:24] <CyberDingus> good lord
[3:35:25] <sad_toast_> why won't you date me 😩 .. I'm from solider
[3:35:25] <%JailShmixRemix> Shinra Middle Manager is my favorite character
[3:35:26] <BillieNoMates> Debating the 8ft, 300lb black guy with a chaingun hand
[3:35:33] <AlexDaGr8> who's this fuckin kiryu lookin ass
[3:35:34] <PsychicKirby> I have to file so much more paperwork now!!!
[3:35:37] <adimcorner> it smells, the Hobo probably leftbut
[3:35:41] <BillieNoMates> I love this shinra guy
[3:35:42] <j0ustar> I have a big hunch about this guy but that I'll keep to myself
[3:35:42] <snowmanse> I can't believe this tiny japanese man thinks he can threaten Barret
[3:35:42] <CyberDingus> angry manlet walk
[3:35:42] <adimcorner> left it
[3:35:44] <arkv01> MOVE 2 SEATS AWAY LUL
[3:35:45] <overkrustice> @BillieNoMates Salary men are strong and fearless
[3:35:46] <+HawkGoggles2> I told him, I sure did. Kappa
[3:35:55] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "Dont engage hotep mode, Barret"
[3:36:02] <BillieNoMates> Ahahaha
[3:36:03] <vincerocmm> what are the gohst
[3:36:05] <SuperVaderMan> Aw shucks, ghost
[3:36:09] <BillieNoMates> free materia
[3:36:11] <arkv01> i really want barret to be punished for these 4th wall crimes
[3:36:12] <sad_toast_> BuT tHe TiMeLiNes
[3:36:14] <overkrustice> It's a shinra theme song
[3:36:14] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 Don't sweat it man, you're not wrong about liking his art. It's a taste kinda thing. Though, having a lot of references certainly tinges my opinion quite a lot...
[3:36:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's the jingle for Mako Cola
[3:36:17] <+Neoripo> But the VA knows
[3:36:22] <silverpoyozo> love the slide
[3:36:23] <Huntercd> I like how that guy only cares about the reactor and not the people harmed
[3:36:24] <+shootbang_exe> do the time ghosts feel like a cheap spiteful meta-commentary to anyone else?
[3:36:26] <AlexDaGr8> what the hell did he even hum
[3:36:29] <BillieNoMates> "I'm from SOLDIER"
[3:36:30] <thepiefoot> Ahh it's that thing the guys do in FF15, right ?
[3:36:34] <%JailShmixRemix> I have nothing more to say to you, as he continues to talk to you
[3:36:42] <BillieNoMates> His viewpoint is legitimately well done
[3:36:47] <SuperVaderMan> Middle Manager is my favorite
[3:36:48] <oshkeet41> I'd love if his title evolved over time as you talk to him, from generic to an actual name
[3:36:50] <PsychicKirby> I never saw that singular unique black man in my life!
[3:36:56] <overkrustice> @shootbang_exe I love em, Makes me feeling like I'm chopping up all the complaining fans
[3:36:59] <oshkeet41> propogrand
[3:37:00] <vonmaultke> marketing
[3:37:00] <BillieNoMates> dogmas?
[3:37:00] <adimcorner> propaganda
[3:37:02] <Victory_Boss> Dogma?
[3:37:02] <MSGlukles> Dogma?
[3:37:06] <vincerocmm> motto/?
[3:37:08] <Triblade1992> propaganda?
[3:37:09] <overkrustice> Creed?
[3:37:12] <+TheSaintJohn> doctrine?
[3:37:16] <vincerocmm> OTHA
[3:37:17] <sad_toast_> "believe in your government... nothing wrong here"
[3:37:26] <hcsarg1986> @KaiserMario Thanks for being so polite It's nice having conversations like this
[3:37:29] <+ninja_galt> propaganda
[3:37:30] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It feels sort of Japanese that he's a middle manager who has these opinions, too. From what I've heard the company ethics get forced on those guys more than the higher ups.
[3:37:32] <arkv01> brainwashing?
[3:37:51] <+Dresdran> Nature worshipers.
[3:37:52] <MSGlukles> 'company culture'
[3:38:03] <sad_toast_> interesting 🤔
[3:38:09] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[3:38:12] <%JailShmixRemix> But I like Sephy's penis
[3:38:13] <arkv01> you must sniff this evil dick and join me!
[3:38:16] <KaiserMario> @hcsarg1986 psaUp All good dude!
[3:38:22] <stratfel112> I'm more impressed he challenged a guy with a gun arm
[3:38:25] <overkrustice> But I like anime
[3:38:28] <sad_toast_> "be evil and wear mascara"
[3:38:33] <Djinnazz> I don't think the ghosts are with him.
[3:38:38] <adimcorner> well, he did know him, but Clowd forgot
[3:38:44] <arkv01> yeah imma be honest I would also simp sephy's peepee
[3:38:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Threat Level: Midnight
[3:39:09] <BillieNoMates> I assume its to make Avalanche FEEL like they are having an effect
[3:39:15] <+Kaadu> He can swing that giant sword in here?
[3:39:21] <arkv01> oh god no the train BibleThump
[3:39:25] <+TheSaintJohn> Threat level critical: send in our smallest bots!
[3:39:28] <BillieNoMates> Otherwise you'd just send a SOLDIER 1st to clear them out
[3:39:37] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I wonder if the drones are designed NOT to shoot Shinra employees?
[3:39:56] <LunarRemix> @BillieNoMates There are no 1st class Soldiers left.
[3:40:02] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Like they are really fuckin that rrain up.
[3:40:18] <arkv01> wow that was... cool
[3:40:24] <%JailShmixRemix> Shinra Middle Manager actually has a character arc
[3:40:25] <arkv01> middle manager kun might be all right
[3:40:26] <stratfel112> Middle manager is the best
[3:40:30] <asurite_warrior> A lot of the more dramatic scenes seem a little forced in this game dont they
[3:40:34] <sad_toast_> left or right .. a life is a life
[3:40:34] <oshkeet41> there's gonna be a hostof Acendended Minor Bit characters i thik
[3:40:38] <j0ustar> Yup hunch got bigger on that guy
[3:40:48] <overkrustice> It's japan, ofcourse they support the guys that are just doing their job
[3:40:53] <arkv01> he's probably going to turn out to be reeve's secretary or assistant
[3:41:02] <+jessedouglas> so far the middle manager has more character then Wedge
[3:41:16] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> rip barrett
[3:41:18] <BillieNoMates> Thats why you heard the crumple
[3:41:18] <PsychicKirby> He's dead
[3:41:18] <TonberryLives> LUL
[3:41:19] <Explodincatz> dead
[3:41:24] <Run44forrest> is barrett dead ?
[3:41:24] <arkv01> barrett has the power of GOD
[3:41:24] <AlexDaGr8> you have to roll, idiot
[3:41:32] <sad_toast_> well Berret is like 2 miles back
[3:41:32] <stratfel112> Barrett does what Barrett do
[3:41:33] <arkv01> HONK
[3:41:34] <vonmaultke> middle manager has more character development then Biggs and Wedge
[3:41:39] <+0ni0n_L0rd> KISS! x24
[3:41:43] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Yeah we gotta slam our hips together to distribute force or something, gurl
[3:41:44] <notanegg8> yeah no it makes more sense cuz look at that
[3:41:45] <Run44forrest> does barrett have gun legs now
[3:41:47] <Victory_Boss> Barret fucking died
[3:41:48] <vincerocmm> rolll
[3:41:54] <derap41> This game is so fucking Horny
[3:41:55] <%JailShmixRemix> Middle manager might be the most developed character so far
[3:41:56] <+Dresdran> I'm Commander Cloud and this is my favorite train in Midgar.
[3:42:04] <thepiefoot> Didn't this turrents only attacked you if you went back in the tunnel ?
[3:42:05] <overkrustice> But, you told him to fly
[3:42:05] <+jessedouglas> @vonmaultke yeah you're are right I forgot to include Biggs
[3:42:32] <+Dresdran> Maybe she should have been a grappler.
[3:42:39] <thepiefoot> I also hate KH combat
[3:42:41] <AlexDaGr8> what if we kissed in an aerial rave?
[3:42:42] <Korgororo> Biggs and wedge are "those two guys"
[3:42:50] <+Dresdran> Just mount an enemy and then pummel them no matter where they went.
[3:42:53] <overkrustice> KH2 combt is fantastic though
[3:42:58] <hcsarg1986> I hope Middle Manager becomes Reeve Tuesti's aide
[3:42:58] <+chattychocobo> there are so many effects
[3:43:03] <sad_toast_> leave the air combos for the demon hunters ...
[3:43:04] <BillieNoMates> Barret screaming because he dislocated both shoulders and legs
[3:43:06] <+muzzle_roar24> I liked KH2 combat
[3:43:15] <vonmaultke> Wonder how they tackle the evalator boss fight?
[3:43:17] <Morsuzado> how DARE they break the realism of this world, ruining cloud swinging around a 100 lb sword.
[3:43:17] <CyberDingus> PLAGUE
[3:43:21] <%JailShmixRemix> I wouldn't say fantastic, but it did fit the games really well
[3:43:23] <stratfel112> Do it!
[3:43:30] <CyberDingus> Save the big black man!
[3:43:33] <oshkeet41> Might lose Tifa Points, if theyre still doing that
[3:43:34] <arkv01> middle manager is gonna make it!
[3:43:35] <CyberDingus> He is too good to die!
[3:43:37] <Sokumotanaka> To be fair it makes fighting flying enemies less annoying
[3:43:42] <overkrustice> My only issue with the aerial combat here is I want more control
[3:43:50] <PsychicKirby> I would rather have this active combat system than turn-based but that's just me.
[3:44:01] <BillieNoMates> The guys with the wrong IDs
[3:44:03] <Korgororo> bitchin time pvpFATTERZ
[3:44:11] <KaiserMario> Crossed fire, Plague
[3:44:11] <arkv01> but I imagine shinra wants collateral deaths to blame on avalanche
[3:44:12] <Dr_Mooose> shoot first sort it out later
[3:44:13] <+Neoripo> Collateral damage
[3:44:20] <BillieNoMates> Well the other guys need to avoid the guy with the gun and swinging a human sized sword
[3:44:23] <+Neoripo> yeah
[3:44:29] <Sokumotanaka> Plague cloud has a big sword and Barret has a gun they need space
[3:44:36] <+Neoripo> They may use the IDs
[3:44:38] <CaptHat211> Unfortunately decent combat is not sufficient enough to distract one from the embarrassingly awful writing that is the KH series.
[3:44:46] <oshkeet41> years later, Manager-san gonna be helping pilot the Highwind
[3:44:47] <BillieNoMates> Cya Barret
[3:44:50] <BillieNoMates> You die now
[3:44:50] <%JailShmixRemix> Tifa's bazoons :)
[3:44:51] <PsychicKirby> I assuma anyone with a valid ID is not targeted, but cross-fire is a thing. So they pushed them into the other car.
[3:45:03] <thepiefoot> Anyone know if this combat has depth ? All i've seen was streamers mashing square
[3:45:04] <overkrustice> she wanted you to say YOU'RE THICC
[3:45:08] <+chattychocobo> wow that guy doesn't sound evil at all!
[3:45:11] <sad_toast_> time for some mustache twirling
[3:45:12] <BillieNoMates> Wow
[3:45:12] <KaiserMario> Oh man, I can't unsee this MGS1 control room! LOOK AT IT
[3:45:15] <Sokumotanaka> @BillieNoMates Barret will return in Avengers 18
[3:45:17] <BillieNoMates> RETURN IT
[3:45:20] <BillieNoMates> IT
[3:45:24] <Run44forrest> jumping off the train seems like a terrible idea
[3:45:24] <wolftundra> But why do that?
[3:45:24] <CaptHat211> "Are we the baddies?"
[3:45:28] <cap_bon> I have the script right here...whered it go
[3:45:34] <BillieNoMates> They need videos
[3:45:40] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[3:45:40] <CyberDingus> Scape goatrs
[3:45:42] <Triblade1992> They need someone they can scapegoat
[3:45:46] <+chattychocobo> no shut up though
[3:45:47] <BillieNoMates> and its easier to go after scape goats
[3:45:49] <sad_toast_> avalanche takes the blame tho
[3:45:53] <Djinnazz> No, but if they're already is one.
[3:45:54] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It looks better if they are leaks or porblems, though
[3:45:55] <+Dresdran> It only works if you don't control everything.
[3:46:00] <overkrustice> They don't need them but avalanche totally makes it more believable and less likely for them to get caught
[3:46:00] <AlexDaGr8> more convincing if someone is doing it in earnest?
[3:46:00] <IntrepidEye> They probably just want the videos of them in the reactor for credibility
[3:46:02] <+Neoripo> Avalanche already exists
[3:46:02] <Run44forrest> but plague then there'd be no game
[3:46:03] <%ragerunner2020> Nice teeth
[3:46:04] <Morsuzado> so I just did the math, that sword would weigh about 100 lbs lol
[3:46:08] <corpsegoo> I mean if you already have the group there's the publicity of public executions
[3:46:09] <SaltyDongs> you use what you got
[3:46:17] <+Dresdran> If they were really powerful but not basically government it might work.
[3:46:19] <+Caidezes> Avalanche already exists and were going to bomb the reactors anyway.
[3:46:19] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Like this way they have legitimate terroriss to execute as well
[3:46:21] <arkv01> LUL
[3:46:21] <KaiserMario> Yeah... but they DO exist though... So might as well, right?
[3:46:22] <oshkeet41> ~BUT TEH LORE~
[3:46:31] <overkrustice> Why is plague so bothered by being wrong
[3:46:34] <@dcn2049> The five novels before this game explained everything, duh
[3:46:46] <xDartuzax> You need to go on their website and read the lore
[3:46:46] <thepiefoot> Unpopular opinion, FF7 didn't need spin off games or movies
[3:46:48] <Triblade1992> Crisis Core had the best change with how Zack Fair's death was handled IMO on the Compilations. Fixed A LOT of plot holes to the original Zack death
[3:46:55] <@dcn2049> He's not bothered by it, it's just something buttchuggers keep doing.
[3:46:55] <HyperBomb21> Maybe The Shinra wants to record them planting the bomb to show the public, make a boogie man out of AVALANCHE
[3:46:57] <reiface08> tifa is so fun to play
[3:47:00] <arkv01> and then 15 spinoff novels about tifa's children from a previous marriage
[3:47:21] <overkrustice> @thepiefoot That's a very popular opinion. But just because it didn't need them doesn't mean they weren't great
[3:47:23] <Djinnazz> faceless enemies only last so long. need a face.
[3:47:44] <arkv01> really? on the stairs tifa?
[3:47:45] <PsychicKirby> When talking about FF lore, the playbook is kinda flexable. In that there is sometimes holes you can drive a Baret into.
[3:47:45] <notanegg8> shinra breaks its windows from the inside and plants graffiti written on posterboard
[3:47:54] <+aspirationdeath> @thepiefoot thats not an unpopular opinion at all. some people like crisis core but its pretty unanimous that most of that stuff is garbage
[3:47:56] <thepiefoot> @overkrustice Fair enough, i never played any of the spin offs tho. I just happen to dislike any FF spin off game out of principle
[3:47:56] <Sokumotanaka> Can we NOT make the black guy a joke in every ff game?
[3:48:19] <Morsuzado> zoneGasm
[3:48:26] <%JailShmixRemix> tklkSword plagueFace
[3:48:30] <thepiefoot> I just prefer to go to the next FF with new story, characters and settings. That was the appeal to me
[3:48:40] <arkv01> yeah the aerial combat is iffy, as everyone else already chimed
[3:48:42] <+Dresdran> They should only have flying enemies while Baret is in the party.
[3:48:51] <arkv01> just give cloud a gun ehhhhh
[3:48:53] <adimcorner> they might have a bigger trap to catch them all ahead, and if one of them is caught the terrorists might leave
[3:48:56] <sad_toast_> are your upgrades up to snuff?
[3:48:59] <+Dresdran> Or give Tifa the ability to jump up, grapple them, and then just start punching.
[3:49:02] <CyberDingus> his bullets make -1 damage
[3:49:05] <BillieNoMates> Barret is more fun
[3:49:05] <hcsarg1986> @Sokumotanaka The Japanese think black people are funny
[3:49:09] <BillieNoMates> GODDAMMIT BARRET
[3:49:15] <Morsuzado> did he just do the victory theme?
[3:49:19] <BillieNoMates> This is why the ghost came
[3:49:23] <thepiefoot> @Dresdran So give Tifa a Devil Buster ?
[3:49:24] <HyperBomb21> haHA I unDERsOod that RefeERENCE
[3:49:25] <jacksawjack> Barret needs to lower his equip load. He's fat rolling everywhere.
[3:49:26] <wolftundra> Lol Cloud's grunt at that
[3:49:29] <BillieNoMates> Its Barrets victory theme
[3:49:29] <Morsuzado> game of the year
[3:49:30] <+aspirationdeath> @thepiefoot again that appeals to most fans of ff. spin offs are widely disliked or tolerated at best
[3:49:32] <+Neoripo> Optional
[3:49:37] <CaptHat211> Roadblock + Mr. T=Barret
[3:49:40] <%ragerunner2020> Tifa and Barret look like they're more fun than cloud
[3:49:45] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Shit's no longer locked!
[3:50:02] <thepiefoot> @aspirationdeath I might have gotten the wrong impression from the FF7 (only) fanboys then. I thought i was in the minority
[3:50:03] <Sokumotanaka> @hcsarg1986 *Sigh* They aren't the only ones, I also don't really need it explained to me I am black
[3:50:04] <TalisKanju> This area is awesome
[3:50:31] <Sokumotanaka> We on plan W
[3:50:41] <arkv01> her cup size?
[3:50:55] <Run44forrest> why is barrett loving this
[3:50:58] <TalisKanju> THE MUSIC IS TOO INAPPROPRIATE
[3:51:02] <CyberDingus> Her cup size is important for the plot
[3:51:10] <CaptHat211> "Oh there's an Auntie Anne's at the station"
[3:51:15] <stratfel112> Nice to know the most gung ho member actually thinks ahead
[3:51:27] <notanegg8> maybe they should have focused less on padding the plot and more on padding her chest Kappa
[3:51:29] <hcsarg1986> @Sokumotanaka Oops Sorry if I sound condescending Didn't know you knew that
[3:51:45] <thepiefoot> I hope they didn't ruin my guy, Rufus.
[3:51:45] <Run44forrest> hahaha he has a scope on the gun arm
[3:51:45] <arkv01> you gotta check out meryls ass
[3:52:09] <HyperBomb21> Heidigger is stupid and wants the satisfaction of beating them
[3:52:11] <LunarRemix> Plague you don't know if there's a reason why they are doing why they are doing it.
[3:52:12] <Sokumotanaka> @hcsarg1986 No you're fine it's just the state of japanese games and black characters is...annoying at times
[3:52:15] <Victory_Boss> Who provides cell service in Midgar?
[3:52:17] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[3:52:21] <Korgororo> maybe it's just me but Tifas bobs are a good size for being noticeable but not jarring
[3:52:22] <thepiefoot> We actually have a lot of more of Heidegger now
[3:52:45] <Sokumotanaka> Wow just like EVERY politician
[3:52:46] <CaptHat211> Scars across/around eyes the most badass type of scars.
[3:52:46] <Run44forrest> why is he russian
[3:52:48] <HyperBomb21> is that john dimagio?
[3:52:52] <BillieNoMates> Just hire Cloud
[3:52:53] <stratfel112> Barrett reminds me alot of big bo
[3:52:55] <+Dresdran> Evil McTwirlyStache.
[3:52:58] <sad_toast_> he's got a hairy everything
[3:53:04] <Relinfearous> He doesn't care about human lives, that's how you know he's the bad guy! Tifa cares about them, you know she's good!
[3:53:06] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It does sound like Dimaggio
[3:53:12] <thepiefoot> Did Heidegger really need more screen time tho ?
[3:53:25] <sad_toast_> it is DiMaggio!!!!!!!
[3:53:45] <CaptHat211> Thought so
[3:53:47] <HyperBomb21> Is is Dimaggio, I just checked
[3:53:57] <arkv01> plot ghosts was a coward move
[3:54:02] <TonberryLives> But Nomura tho
[3:54:04] <hcsarg1986> He's an interesting question Who's your favorite Shinra executive guys? Can we make a poll?
[3:54:06] <+aspirationdeath> moments like that help the story not feel rushed.
[3:54:07] <+Caidezes> Time ghosts are always needed.
[3:54:20] <+wjones0415> wjones0415 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:54:21] <thepiefoot> IMO all this separating into three games just bloats each part way more when they didn't needed it
[3:54:25] <AlexDaGr8> wait, are they actually time ghosts or is that just the meme
[3:54:26] <sad_toast_> Pat's really digging the ghosts 😏
[3:54:45] <Run44forrest> plagueFace . o O ( c805Kawa c805Tachi )
[3:54:51] <arkv01> stamp is the resistance doggo?
[3:54:57] <Triblade1992> I think there needs to be SOMETHING that allows the player to make choices in future games though. I would like an option to either try and save Aerith or keep aerith dying her iconic death for example. Gets away from the "LOL AERITH RESSURECTION" DLC
[3:55:29] <sad_toast_> yeah get upgrades up to snuff
[3:55:43] <+aspirationdeath> i think they have a decent sense of pacing. just a shame much of the plot is nonsense, but thats an issue of most jrpgs
[3:55:44] <+Punishedkaiger> Barret seems really good at making things stagger quickly
[3:55:51] <+Neoripo> Stamp is Shinra's mascot, but Avalanche use it as a guide
[3:56:02] <CursedNobleman> but its preeeeeetty
[3:56:05] <+Neoripo> But Cristarium tho
[3:56:11] <AlexDaGr8> skyrim lookin ass menu
[3:56:12] <Sokumotanaka> Oh plague live alittle
[3:56:24] <+aspirationdeath> i like it :)
[3:56:25] <notanegg8> first time i entered this menu i thought i was getting a gacha pull
[3:56:27] <sund0wner> EXTRA dimensional sphere bullshit grid
[3:56:29] <sad_toast_> they took one look at Skyrim 9 years ago "oooh oh let's do that for upgrade!!"
[3:56:29] <Triblade1992> This is literally a terrible version of the Cyrstarium from FF13 and as a fan of that game I am offended with how bad this iis
[3:56:30] <hypersongi> Its sounds dumb. But people WANT to see spreadsheets okay.
[3:56:31] <PsychicKirby> Just wanted to do fancy FFX sphere grid? idk
[3:56:41] <CaptHat211> Don't think, Eli. Its bright and colorful!
[3:56:44] <tukds> Am I watching Pat suffer through RE6? Literally every word out of your mouth is a complaint about something no matter how inconsequential because it can do no good by you. Its kind of funny to see the suffering part 2
[3:56:49] <CursedNobleman> its a valid criticism. but PRETTY GRAPHICS
[3:56:53] <arkv01> I most definitely do not understand, I want more explanations
[3:56:56] <+ninja_galt> FF menu's get crazier with every console gen
[3:56:57] <markdreizehn> The Time Police WILL stop you if you break canon Ellie
[3:56:58] <Relinfearous> peepoLeave
[3:57:03] <PsychicKirby> I mean it's fancy, but not accessability friendly.
[3:57:03] <cap_bon> No talk more about the UI
[3:57:05] <HyperBomb21> NOOOO you can't criticize this video game!!
[3:57:11] <Sokumotanaka> Oh I dont wanna stop you but I also think it's a silly complaint
[3:57:19] <CursedNobleman> haha, plague of gripes go GRRRRRRR
[3:57:19] <KaiserMario> I enjoy the so called "griping", it's why I'm here
[3:57:19] <arkv01> nooo its perfect you can't shit on final fantasy its sacrilegeee nooo!
[3:57:20] <sund0wner> "MAKE EVERYTHING PRETTY"
[3:57:28] <xDartuzax> he's falling for our reverse psychology
[3:57:29] <%Samex_Comex> I'm back from work
[3:57:29] <sund0wner> "But what about accessibility?"
[3:57:30] <sad_toast_> today I learned his name is Eli 🤔 I'm no where near a true fan apparently 😔
[3:57:34] <sund0wner> "FUCK YOU"
[3:57:39] <Sokumotanaka> We could be fixing the actual problems like the simping girl characters
[3:57:39] <+aspirationdeath> @tukds thats his shtick tho. malding spectrum warrior complains about media
[3:57:50] <LunarRemix> If anything it only makes me think why they made they spin around. It only makes it more confusing.
[3:57:54] <+Neoripo> This is a bad version of the cristarium design wise (utility wise it's much better), which in turn was a bad copy of the sphere grid
[3:58:00] <@dcn2049> imagine watching someone named plague of gripes, and complaining about him griping
[3:58:01] <CursedNobleman> its okay, lp handicap
[3:58:02] <Korgororo> don't lie plague LUL
[3:58:03] <+ninja_galt> SNES FF3 is still best FF
[3:58:09] <CursedNobleman> @ninja_galt TRUTH.
[3:58:10] <Run44forrest> Kappa
[3:58:11] <RazHarvey> Uh huh
[3:58:27] <arkv01> I really still don't understand if they're trying to make the sci-fi space shit canon in this remake
[3:58:28] <KaiserMario> Weapons gain SP equally
[3:58:30] <+ninja_galt> kefka would body sephiroth in one hit
[3:58:32] <Korgororo> don't be ashamed of being bad at Gamez pvpSK
[3:58:32] <CursedNobleman> actually, tactics might be best, but FF3 is the best mainline
[3:58:43] <+aspirationdeath> that and his uplifting stories of farm life
[3:58:45] <arkv01> @ninja_galt sure, so would goku
[3:58:45] <+Neoripo> FF9 is the best or tied with 6 as the best
[3:58:48] <jon651> You get 5 SP every time you lv up I think
[3:58:51] <TonberryLives> @dcn2049 It's a self-sustaining economy Kappa
[3:59:06] <%Samex_Comex> Yup
[3:59:09] <cyberblueneon> i could not stand 6 with the random encounters every 4 seconds
[3:59:11] <KaiserMario> Excuses, excuses... tsk tsk...
[3:59:18] <HyperBomb21> depends on how much you're talking
[3:59:25] <RazHarvey> Exactly
[3:59:26] <Triblade1992> @CursedNobleman are you talking about FF6 (American FF3)? because FF3 is the one with Cloud of Darkness
[3:59:28] <CursedNobleman> @cyberblueneon just spam autocrossbow and use the emulator speedup LUL
[3:59:37] <CursedNobleman> FF6, i liked FF3 though
[3:59:41] <+Neoripo> If you think 6 had a lot of encounters, you did not play 1
[4:00:11] <+aspirationdeath> @neoripo its relative. and yeah 1 is painful to play.
[4:00:12] <+ninja_galt> I punched so many brontosauruses to get to level 99
[4:00:12] <reiface08> chocochick?
[4:00:18] <Triblade1992> Chocobo?
[4:00:23] <Korgororo> FOREHEADBUNCLE
[4:00:31] <arkv01> their foreheads are frightening
[4:00:38] <reiface08> it's in the options menu
[4:00:40] <General_Terro> menu>system>dlc
[4:00:41] <CursedNobleman> chocogirl?
[4:00:44] <Triblade1992> Carbuncle worked out in the library
[4:00:46] <CursedNobleman> chocolina?
[4:00:53] <Triblade1992> He has big brain energy
[4:01:06] <+Neoripo> FF1 loves to drop you in a single square room in dungeons and making you fight 1 encounter per step until you reach the exit door
[4:01:20] <PsychicKirby> I don't know why but after Golden Sun: Dark Dawn I grew a bit tired of turn-based random-encounter jrpgs...
[4:01:22] <CursedNobleman> marsh cave...
[4:01:45] <+Neoripo> yeah, hallway of 1step encounter
[4:01:57] <cap_bon> bulletproof vest apparently has zero stats in this world LUL
[4:01:58] <CursedNobleman> my favorite turn based RPG is probably BOF4, and i dont care to play it nowadays LUL
[4:01:59] <LunarRemix> That's just old RPGs
[4:02:05] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes go to options system dlc
[4:02:09] <+ninja_galt> fix yo screen
[4:02:35] <sad_toast_> he said it wouldn't take long ...
[4:02:42] <hypersongi> the train passes by when you cant get hit. thats cool
[4:02:45] <CursedNobleman> this part is waaaaaaay too long i think
[4:03:01] <+Neoripo> no, the encounter rate in that hallway was on purpose. someone in Squaresoft was bored that day
[4:04:03] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes did you already download the preorder dlc? if so then in systems menu
[4:04:42] <LunarRemix> That's why game with good systems make it so it's 2.5 times instead of just double, to make it worth it
[4:04:56] <Triblade1992> BIG BRAIN ENERGY!
[4:05:00] <CursedNobleman> cactuar! cactuar! cactuar!
[4:05:01] <+Neoripo> Full-on Nomura design
[4:05:15] <HyperBomb21> Galaxy bain
[4:05:20] <KaiserMario> Cactuar always looks fine
[4:05:29] <possiblehero> You're awesome Plague
[4:05:43] <CursedNobleman> might be gamebreaking?
[4:05:52] <CursedNobleman> 4head
[4:05:54] <Run44forrest> 5Head
[4:05:58] <PsychicKirby> tomatoBrain
[4:05:59] <Triblade1992> He worked out at the library
[4:06:05] <Korgororo> 6Head
[4:06:06] <+House_0f_Rage> Hey Ho Plague
[4:06:14] <Run44forrest> has5
[4:06:19] <+Neoripo> Looks gamebreaking with being maxed and all
[4:06:22] <KaiserMario> What's it called again? Hydroencephalitis?
[4:06:42] <Run44forrest> yes
[4:06:45] <TheOneUpWarrior> what's up plague!? having a good night I hope. just started my run on ff7 Remake. so far it looks and feels amazing
[4:06:55] <+Neoripo> Stamp
[4:08:14] <PsychicKirby> Very dumb question, but what is Mako?
[4:08:27] <Triblade1992> @TheOneUpWarrior I like how the game level design feels natural instead of "LOL Open world" and the combat being a combo of FF13 and KH combat.
[4:08:29] <sad_toast_> like my dad 😁
[4:08:32] <%Samex_Comex> Damn Albed
[4:08:33] <Korgororo> the tears of the planet
[4:08:35] <+Neoripo> Processed Lifestream
[4:08:51] <hypersongi> Isn't it nice when you properly blame ***ALL*** your problems on just one source?
[4:09:00] <PsychicKirby> Ah, so the company's run-off?
[4:09:07] <+northsouthmiddledakota> Like Pat and mind goblins
[4:09:14] <notanegg8> to my understanding, mako is the lifeblood of the world which the shinra corporation is draining for power
[4:09:18] <Run44forrest> mako is soylent green
[4:09:41] <PsychicKirby> Okay, thanks.
[4:10:29] <+Neoripo> It's as if you took the greek river stix, souls and all and used it to power your TV. that is Mako. Compressed Mako turns into materia, but materia can occur naturally
[4:10:32] <AlexDaGr8> doesn't auto-cure expend MP though? might get used when you don't wait it to
[4:10:33] <BillieNoMates> just threw it in Tifas face
[4:10:44] <LunarRemix> That's too much cobweb.
[4:11:15] <PsychicKirby> So Mako if the plot Micguffin that everyone wants. Or Baret ust wants to put back.
[4:11:43] <TheOneUpWarrior> did you find a crap load of Google medals in the beginning or is it just me?
[4:11:50] <TheOneUpWarrior> moogle*
[4:11:52] <LunarRemix> It's not reallya micguffin. It's more like a background thing to the story.
[4:12:17] <PsychicKirby> Hmmmm, okay
[4:12:50] <SuperVaderMan> oh no, hydralisks
[4:12:53] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[4:12:57] <Victory_Boss> Just need to pull back their shells to see Angeal's face
[4:13:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:13:11] <%JailShmixRemix> Hot
[4:13:17] <notanegg8> it's the setting's power source. barrett would like you to stop using it because taking it is killing the planet.
[4:13:33] <%Samex_Comex> Like my penis
[4:13:48] <LunarRemix> Slow
[4:14:02] <notanegg8> again never played this game so i could be off base
[4:14:10] <+Neoripo> In this universe ythe planet is a gigatic living thing, and spirit energy/lifestream is it's blood. If Mako (processed energy) is extracted in unsustainable quantities, the enviroment loses the capacity to sustain life
[4:14:17] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> No that's pretty accurate.
[4:14:28] <notanegg8> ff7 is only half a year older than me
[4:14:35] <+Neoripo> That is why the slums don't have flowers,
[4:15:15] <PsychicKirby> But it basically helps develope the setting and world. Was it used to make the Soilders? I'm afraid to ask because people are on spoiler lockdown.
[4:15:34] <+justianxix> Isn't Mako literally the dead memories of all life
[4:15:35] <%Samex_Comex> Look at him go
[4:15:39] <LunarRemix> Yeah Soldiers are infused with Mako.
[4:15:44] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> In a way. Soldiers are "exposed" to mako energy as a way to enhance their abilities.
[4:15:46] <CursedNobleman> oh cactuar, everyone loves you
[4:15:46] <LunarRemix> The higher your class, the more Mako.
[4:16:07] <+Neoripo> Yes, Mako was infused in humans to create soldiers. Basically it overcharges humas with life
[4:16:15] <PsychicKirby> Okay, and that makes it relevent to Cloud too.
[4:16:22] <AlexDaGr8> two queen grashtrikes? true lesbian icons
[4:16:32] <PsychicKirby> Plot making way more sense
[4:16:38] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Yes, I'm not sure if they say it here, but in the original game, people comment that Cloud has different eyes due to mako exposure.
[4:16:49] <+Neoripo> Yeah, Cloud's eyes hinda glow because of the MAKO
[4:16:51] <notanegg8> hope all these explanations aren't more than you bargained for when you asked that, lol
[4:17:00] <LunarRemix> Here Cloud mentions it a few times.
[4:17:01] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> And I believe initially its used to explain his connection to Sephiroth.
[4:17:29] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Like, that's how they ease into that fork in the story.
[4:17:40] <PsychicKirby> For, me it's fine. FF7 is as old or slightly younger than me. Really my fault for never playing.
[4:17:47] <+Neoripo> In fact, i the bike section with Jessie you could see how Cloud's eyes kinda glow
[4:18:34] <LunarRemix> Yeah you can.
[4:18:36] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I mean they ARE soldiers, still.
[4:18:39] <PsychicKirby> Still doesn't explain the ghosts so I get why people are eeeeehhhhhhh
[4:18:48] <+whiskey_wolfe_> They don't believe it, but that doesn't matter.
[4:18:48] <CursedNobleman> it feels like barrets personality changes over the first 10 hours
[4:18:49] <%JailShmixRemix> You totally can, people do it all the time
[4:18:51] <+TheBigO75> Can you not hear the earth crying?
[4:18:53] <CursedNobleman> hes much less hardass now
[4:18:59] <LunarRemix> The same way some people belive everyone in the goverment is in the conspiracy and no one ever snitches.
[4:19:05] <+Neoripo> Yeah, Ghosts are new and not explained
[4:19:15] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> These guys aren't janitors or conductoirs.
[4:19:30] <+aspirationdeath> @lunarremix or that anyones ever on the same page
[4:19:32] <notanegg8> the soldiers are just doing their job and shinra's letting avalanche eat their lunch, despite not needing avalanche
[4:19:39] <PsychicKirby> These security guards are tools of the MAN!
[4:20:09] <PsychicKirby> I mean I'm weak to being set on fire
[4:20:09] <%Samex_Comex> Fire hot
[4:20:16] <+Neoripo> Heidegger doesn't care if they die, did not even warn then, the bastard
[4:20:51] <cap_bon> I guess if you set their backpack on fire that would be a weakness
[4:21:24] <Run44forrest> i havent played the original i just took the ghosts as a result of the mako storage getting blown up
[4:21:25] <+Neoripo> Backpack goes boom
[4:21:31] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I feel like at this point Plague has traversed almost as much underground tunnels as he has actual above-ground settlements.
[4:21:57] <Run44forrest> wu tang ?
[4:22:07] <saw6boy> Hi Plague!
[4:22:09] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> WUTAI AINT NOTHIN TA FUCK WIT
[4:22:13] <CursedNobleman> Tunnel snakes RULE
[4:22:17] <notanegg8> ......what does sparing your enemies have anything to do with reports
[4:22:22] <PsychicKirby> @Run44forrest But that might make too much sense. LUL
[4:22:22] <+Neoripo> Ghosts are completely new
[4:22:23] <%Samex_Comex> John DiMaggio?
[4:22:48] <Triblade1992> Heidegger isn't the brightest bulb to screw in
[4:22:50] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I guess the idea was they analyzed wether Avalanche has to be killed outright instead of captured?
[4:22:50] <AlexDaGr8> heidegger confirmed pissy baby all the time
[4:22:55] <+0ni0n_L0rd> He just likes the sound of his own voice
[4:23:00] <HyperBomb21> Relax, heidigger, you havent even won yet
[4:23:19] <+Neoripo> Shinra soldier: Ignore him, just ignore him and all will be fine!
[4:23:24] <LunarRemix> BIg strong man no think no good.
[4:23:27] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> No but see after they blow up the reactor he has to murder them super hard.
[4:23:34] <BillieNoMates> Remember that Shinra wants a reason to move everything to Neo Midgard
[4:23:37] <PsychicKirby> He wants the public glory of taking them down?
[4:23:41] <Gavaline> Seemed more like he didn't really care what their abilities were - simply get it done and stop wasting my time mentality
[4:23:45] <HyperBomb21> He wants the public glory
[4:23:49] <notanegg8> this has about as many plot holes as my writing
[4:23:58] <KaiserMario> You're overthinking Plague, you've gotta do like Pat and just enjoy more cutscenes and fancy graphics!
[4:24:05] <vonmaultke> The plot makes no sense, the Shinra grunts know it and are concerned with their management
[4:24:16] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I think Heidegger is just increasing the death tally of Avalanche
[4:24:34] <collind99> Maybe final fantasy was never really good
[4:24:36] <BillieNoMates> Deploy the bioweapon
[4:24:54] <notanegg8> why increase their death tally when you can just make one up
[4:24:59] <PsychicKirby> @vonmaultke Let's start a union! LUL
[4:25:13] <+Neoripo> Pat wiped here
[4:25:15] <Explodincatz> Pat died here
[4:25:32] <vonmaultke> They should LUL
[4:25:39] <CursedNobleman> starting a union in a locale with one employer and they have a police state 4Head
[4:25:56] <collind99> @kaisermario thats dumb and gives pat too little credit
[4:26:21] <KaiserMario> @collind99 LUL yeah I know!
[4:26:23] <vonmaultke> Well if you ARE the police in the police state you can force it 4Head or destroy shinra from the inside
[4:26:42] <PsychicKirby> @CursedNobleman But we desurve dental, we're being opressed!
[4:27:15] <sadboy_otoroshi> Tifa can just punch people high into the air with er arm-noodles.
[4:27:22] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> When everyone gets turned into Sephiroth thralls they won't need dental. You know that guy has perfect teeth.
[4:27:41] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[4:27:43] <vonmaultke> perfect hair too
[4:27:46] <CursedNobleman> they might be dogteeth, but yes, good dental
[4:27:51] <BillieNoMates> I like the banter
[4:27:52] <+DERGONS86> Should I play the original or just get the new version of this?
[4:28:00] <%JailShmixRemix> Both
[4:28:04] <+Neoripo> Yep
[4:28:13] <stratfel112> Cloud with Dry humor? not bad
[4:28:18] <%JailShmixRemix> So far they are two different experiences
[4:28:22] <notanegg8> depends on whether you want to play a turn-based rpg or a
[4:28:23] <+Neoripo> Stamp theme song
[4:28:26] <Run44forrest> SourPls
[4:28:30] <HyperBomb21> SourPls
[4:28:31] <notanegg8> enter key
[4:28:32] <CursedNobleman> i dont dig the pacing in this personally
[4:28:35] <%JailShmixRemix> This is my jam
[4:28:46] <KaiserMario> @collind99 But... I do think Pat is enthralled but how fancy the game looks and by all the extra cutscenes, and also he takes a lot of enjoyment by cringeworthy scenes. He just laughs off things that are really bad
[4:28:47] <Gavaline> You know you want to buy the song
[4:28:51] <Triblade1992> Tthat's cute
[4:29:04] <LunarRemix> They put efford.
[4:29:09] <+whiskey_wolfe_> This is like French Canada's favourite cartoon
[4:29:11] <stfn893> stfn893 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[4:29:21] <Fredcome2bed> yes!
[4:29:21] <PsychicKirby> I wonder how many of these Shinra guards are going to be thrown into the wood chipper before they're like, "Maybe that Baret guy has a point."
[4:29:22] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It's good OP music.
[4:29:22] <stfn893> Why did I do that
[4:30:05] <HyperBomb21> It's time to Assess the situation
[4:30:36] <Run44forrest> how do you level up materia. does it just happen through fights?
[4:30:40] <BillieNoMates> Barrier, reflect , wall
[4:30:41] <Fredcome2bed> deflect?
[4:30:41] <BillieNoMates> I think
[4:30:44] <Fredcome2bed> reflect
[4:30:47] <LunarRemix> Shell I think.
[4:30:53] <LunarRemix> Yeah wall.
[4:30:56] <CursedNobleman> wall?
[4:30:59] <LunarRemix> Wall which was both physical and magical.
[4:31:09] <BillieNoMates> I never used it because Mighty Guard was vastly better
[4:31:33] <PsychicKirby> @Run44forrest From what I've seen, equip, use, level
[4:32:17] <graemecrackers2> Shouldnt barrets gun do more damage?
[4:32:35] <graemecrackers2> Then tifas punching
[4:32:43] <%JailShmixRemix> Fists hurt
[4:32:56] <cap_bon> fire hot
[4:33:06] <LunarRemix> Barret's bullets are probably magical in some form because he doesn't have to reload.
[4:33:36] <stfn893> hm this looks linear Just how I like it
[4:33:39] <PsychicKirby> @graemecrackers2 Given that it's a gun, one would think but.
[4:33:54] <arkv01> hey, salute those warriors who did
[4:33:54] <+DERGONS86> Maybe the workers get lost easily?
[4:33:56] <stratfel112> Nah it's fine
[4:34:00] <Fredcome2bed> yeah
[4:34:05] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:34:05] <CursedNobleman> i dont question fallout new vegas graffiti, why would i question this? LUL
[4:34:16] <PsychicKirby> We got to get our tag on. We're Get'n Up.
[4:34:20] <+BonewheelVanguard> TIME FOR CRAB
[4:34:22] <cap_bon> you look like a boss battle
[4:34:32] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague spoiled himsefl
[4:34:34] <graemecrackers2> Not just a gun but fully automatic
[4:34:38] <CursedNobleman> CRAB. BATTLE.
[4:34:49] <Sokumotanaka> Plague read the script
[4:34:52] <BillieNoMates> The fact it was the same tone as the background items made it misleading
[4:34:55] <PsychicKirby> Quick tag it's camera with spray paint!
[4:34:59] <+Punishedkaiger> ATTACK THE WEAK POINT FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE
[4:35:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:35:04] <Run44forrest> 🦀
[4:35:06] <+BonewheelVanguard> Lightning wrecks legs
[4:35:12] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> ases the leggies
[4:35:20] <+Neoripo> old Scorpion guardian
[4:35:22] <BillieNoMates> Wutai was the last war
[4:35:29] <+Neoripo> Wutai war
[4:35:31] <BillieNoMates> Well they are a political power
[4:35:35] <+MisterRockett> They are.
[4:35:35] <Fredcome2bed> Music is great
[4:35:49] <+MisterRockett> They're a power company that owns the planet.
[4:35:54] <arkv01> I can't wait til they use all this tech for X-ATM in ff8
[4:35:54] <LunarRemix> But they are. They made the Soldiers who won the war.
[4:35:55] <stfn893> Whens the lightning cameo
[4:35:56] <CursedNobleman> theyre weird, a corporate government
[4:35:57] <PsychicKirby> Well I mean it seems like they basically have a millitary state so.
[4:36:05] <graemecrackers2> I like Tifas thigh game
[4:36:13] <BillieNoMates> I think it's slow
[4:36:14] <CursedNobleman> its surprising wutai remotely stands a chance against them. hell. its a wonder they dont own the world
[4:36:22] <BillieNoMates> and it just affects the ATB meter
[4:36:39] <arkv01> the devs knew bewbs we're in trend anymore and everyone who played the original grew up into leg degens
[4:36:50] <BillieNoMates> Wutai was filled with magic bullshit and super ninja
[4:37:15] <CursedNobleman> and killer lightning birds. fair point
[4:37:18] <+Cthulos> Sorry for calling you a nerd
[4:37:19] <LunarRemix> The typical east vs west / nature vs technology
[4:37:29] <BillieNoMates> Pretty much
[4:37:34] <stfn893> Man barret is so cool
[4:37:45] <+LordSDB> That symbol was for stop
[4:37:53] <arkv01> BIG shottie!
[4:38:04] <PsychicKirby> And in fairness Barret does look great in this
[4:38:16] <%JailShmixRemix> All the models look great
[4:38:26] <HyperBomb21> Barret got treated nicely in this remake
[4:38:29] <+LordSDB> Though can you get stop this early?
[4:38:30] <HyperBomb21> H's great
[4:38:37] <+Neoripo> I think it's more Wutai being islacionist and having a defined central power, unlike the rest of the planet
[4:38:50] <arkv01> did they just combine?
[4:39:01] <notanegg8> mad because adds
[4:39:05] <+BonewheelVanguard> That's one angry crab
[4:39:09] <%JailShmixRemix> Cactuar time'
[4:39:09] <CursedNobleman> i mean if you think of how much power and armies shinra has, the political structure makes no sense
[4:39:24] <CursedNobleman> shinra has an army, a navy, and a bare airforce
[4:39:36] <BillieNoMates> How so? Shinra is a megacorp that has the power of a country
[4:39:36] <LunarRemix> Hopefully it's something that they expand on the Remakes.
[4:39:40] <SchroedingersFerret> Summon Hypetuar
[4:39:43] <arkv01> it's the standard cyberpunk paradigm where big corp is the govt
[4:39:44] <LunarRemix> Many things don't make much sense in the original.
[4:39:50] <LunarRemix> Like how people travel between cities and stuff.
[4:40:15] <BillieNoMates> they probably dont
[4:40:29] <LunarRemix> Like a simple thing like going from Midgar to the Golden Saucer. It's a journey and a half for Cloud and Co, I can't imagine normal people making that journey
[4:40:32] <CursedNobleman> midgard zolom LUL
[4:40:32] <BillieNoMates> Most midgard people probably live and die there
[4:40:52] <BillieNoMates> Well Golden Saucer was super luxury so probably only super rich people went
[4:40:57] <Huntercd> But cars exist
[4:41:06] <BillieNoMates> and they have aircraf
[4:41:06] <LunarRemix> Cars exist but roads don't.
[4:41:11] <BillieNoMates> aircraft*
[4:41:15] <CursedNobleman> what FF7 town would you want to grow up in? Cosmo canyon for me
[4:41:21] <Huntercd> That makes no sense
[4:41:21] <arkv01> yeah it'll be interesting how they deal with the world map travel in the next few installments
[4:41:25] <HyperBomb21> Zodiac age improved them a bit
[4:41:33] <%caramello_man> ff12 is all about quickenings isnt it?
[4:41:36] <PsychicKirby> Honestly chat that's why I worried when Plague said so many contributed to the writing in the original. Was it cohesive? Was it's identity compromised? Did it know where it's going?
[4:41:47] <arkv01> I think we have the tech now to implement a world map that makes sense
[4:41:51] <LunarRemix> It was cohesive for a PS1 game.
[4:42:01] <arkv01> cohesive for the 90s
[4:42:03] <+LordSDB> Yeah in OG 12 quickening were way better for use than any summon
[4:42:12] <HyperBomb21> 7 wasnt as cohesive as 6 was
[4:42:19] <BillieNoMates> 3003
[4:42:21] <PsychicKirby> Okay, I can dig those as answers.
[4:42:27] <+LordSDB> Plus turning the party from 3 to 2 sucked, but Zodiac age fixes all those issues
[4:42:31] <CursedNobleman> do diesel/steampunk games have to make sense in a world?
[4:42:32] <+Neoripo> Yeah, in the old game Shinra is the closest to a central government that you get. Government in FF7 planet seems to be limited to the village. So no presidents or armies, just Mayor at most. The only place with something resembling an army was Wutai
[4:42:35] <KaiserMario> @caramello_man You can do without, but yes, quickening would do bonkers dmg
[4:42:39] <LunarRemix> FF7 came out in 97, RPGs weren't as in-depth as they were today
[4:42:56] <CursedNobleman> like arcanums world... kinda makes sense, but its much more homogenous
[4:42:59] <ZigZagaroo> !uptime
[4:43:00] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 43 minutes 11 seconds
[4:43:02] <LunarRemix> Most if not all RPGs of that era were you in a journey to save the planet.
[4:43:11] <Hellarussian> big smelly metal crab
[4:43:13] <BillieNoMates> ROADROLLER
[4:43:17] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> "Gotta get these crystals"
[4:43:18] <LunarRemix> Not much "How do people eat" or "How do people get around"
[4:43:23] <HyperBomb21> He looks like a cool robot
[4:43:41] <+aspirationdeath> @psychickirby the original was shlock too. it seems like new plot details are just added contrivances rather than clarifying or shoring up anything
[4:43:43] <sad_toast_> Train Head
[4:43:51] <CursedNobleman> where do midgar people get food?
[4:44:01] <+Neoripo> FFXIV attack
[4:44:02] <CursedNobleman> kalm or choco ranch makes sense, but you dont see any trade routes
[4:44:26] <+Dresdran> I would assume power for food with the nearby villages and towns.
[4:44:41] <LunarRemix> It was a '97 PS1 RPG, you didn't ask those kinds of questions back then.
[4:44:49] <+Dresdran> Midgar produces the fancy shit, the surrounding provides the basic resources.
[4:45:00] <PsychicKirby> Okay, cause I always loved FF art and style but was always put off from investing in them.
[4:45:35] <arkv01> you're generally supposed to turn off your higher investigative brain functions when playing jrpgs
[4:45:40] <+aspirationdeath> @psychickirby this does add more character moments which are way more important than plot in these games, imo
[4:45:42] <CursedNobleman> midgar cant develop their own food because of the mako they drain, thats why the land is barren for a giant radius outside
[4:45:55] <notanegg8> i like to claim i'm a big turn-based rpg fan but i've never managed to play a ff game for more than a little bit lol
[4:45:56] <HyperBomb21> So far, the Time Jannies and Sephiroth are the only parts of the remake's story I would actually call "bad"
[4:45:56] <arkv01> you have less fun exposing all the cracks the first time around
[4:46:43] <Huntercd> How does a electric company attack a country like Wutai?
[4:46:49] <CursedNobleman> i struggle to enjoy the pacing in this compared to the original
[4:46:55] <+Neoripo> A lot of JRPG's are more about the journey, and that is where the resources where put. So worldbuilding had to be cut somewhat
[4:46:56] <PsychicKirby> I ironically made the mistake of digging my grave with KH though. Kappa
[4:47:01] <CursedNobleman> @Huntercd pro clod, highwind, subs
[4:47:26] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> By the time of Wutai they already had Sephiroth
[4:47:36] <HyperBomb21> Battle's end too quickly for Limit
[4:47:41] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> And...those other guys
[4:47:46] <arkv01> @CursedNobleman that's fair, the remake segments in the original could be done in 2-3 hours
[4:47:50] <arkv01> this is stretched to 30ish
[4:48:10] <stfn893> Thats miguel I mean carlos' va
[4:48:10] <Huntercd> So there must have been a government before they got big
[4:48:26] <PsychicKirby> No but fight the demon though.
[4:48:30] <arkv01> yo das a cool phone
[4:48:31] <CyberDingus> casually using a phone
[4:48:40] <stfn893> The president is not on his fav 5
[4:48:52] <notanegg8> i like magic smartphones, i think they're cool
[4:48:54] <arkv01> yes, he's also an ex-turk, but no problems at all!
[4:48:56] <CursedNobleman> hmm... maybe shinra started out a town, invested in science, they became a nationalized power-nation-state
[4:48:59] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Yeah, presumably. I never got into the Compilation material so I don't know if they expand on how Shinra consolidated power.
[4:49:03] <+Dresdran> Shinra will now switch over to Argent Energy.
[4:49:15] <+Neoripo> He wants to beat them onhis own instead of using the president's plan. I think
[4:49:26] <arkv01> yeah those parts are stupid but enjoyable in a stupid way LUL
[4:49:27] <CyberDingus> He won't use lube
[4:49:28] <CyberDingus> WON'T.
[4:49:29] <BillieNoMates> inb4 this guy is Johnny Sasaki
[4:49:30] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> I always assumed Midgar was like Nibelheim for years and it was very slow going until someone made a breakthrough with mako research.
[4:49:45] <arkv01> heidegger would cut nuts off
[4:49:46] <Bacon_Rage> Bacon_Rage subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[4:49:47] <Victory_Boss> I wonder if he is the bad guy?
[4:49:48] <vonmaultke> EVIL LAUGHTER
[4:49:58] <stfn893> Heidegger is like Hauk
[4:49:58] <Run44forrest> does he get paid just to laugh
[4:50:02] <LunarRemix> If you want to get stupid, FF7 is a sequel to FFX.
[4:50:12] <LunarRemix> Let's not get into this rabbit hole.
[4:50:15] <+Neoripo> true
[4:50:16] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> That was just a joke.
[4:50:18] <PsychicKirby> ..... WHAT
[4:50:23] <LunarRemix> Let's not.
[4:50:25] <heroicspiritavenger> Hey Plague, what do you think about the fact that it's clear that with the next Final Fantasy 7 entry, they will drop the word Remake and instead use a different Re word; like Reunion, Rememberance, etc
[4:50:32] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> It's not like FF9 and FF1.
[4:50:37] <Huntercd> But FFX-2 is a sequel to X
[4:50:40] <CursedNobleman> the ff7 wiki covers the history of shinra quite well actually
[4:50:49] <CaptainFrankincense> i can think of a few more re words
[4:51:00] <+Neoripo> @heroicspiritavenger don't spoil
[4:51:01] <Run44forrest> FInal Fantasy REVALAITONS
[4:51:03] <TonberryLives> @LunarRemix Let us not blaspheme NotLikeThis

[4:51:38] <arkv01> gackt MUST win
[4:51:53] <heroicspiritavenger> @Neoripo It's literally just a matter that this series the first entry of the FF7 revisits is Entry 1: Remake
[4:51:54] <HyperBomb21> As far as I am concerned, "if it's not in the OG, it's not canon". I feel this way about most series
[4:52:08] <+Neoripo> Interesting
[4:52:09] <CursedNobleman> NEVER STOP WRITING. 4Head
[4:52:11] <%Gogogolem> But i love the garbage.
[4:52:15] <LunarRemix> Some people totally do though.
[4:52:21] <PsychicKirby> Big freak'n oof
[4:52:26] <suitangi021> God Tifa looks so good in this game. I only wish she had more muscle definition.
[4:52:33] <+Neoripo> Like Gackt
[4:52:37] <stfn893> Man do I need to watch advent children before this
[4:52:39] <TonberryLives> I was really hoping they were going to drop the compilation crap. They did not need it.
[4:52:39] <heroicspiritavenger> @Neoripo Like Remake is the subtitle for this specific game, and the next Entry won't be called FF7 Remake
[4:52:43] <LunarRemix> Star Wars?

[4:54:42] <Huntercd> If Lucas planned Luke and Leia to be siblings, why were they kissing in the first place?
[4:54:46] <stfn893> Is this the twin snakes type or remake
[4:54:47] <CursedNobleman> @sadboy_otoroshi you just want an anime orc waifu

[4:54:59] <+Neoripo> No
[4:55:11] <BillieNoMates> Lucas has kinks, Huntercd
[4:55:15] <PsychicKirby> I would just like to thank chat for being so accomedating to my lack of FF7 knowledge.
[4:55:18] <BillieNoMates> and he WILL force them on you
[4:55:22] <arkv01> welcome to cloud's twin snakes
[4:55:26] <+Neoripo> it seems more like an EVA rebuild type of remake
[4:55:33] <CursedNobleman> more like rebuild of FF7
[4:55:39] <+Neoripo> yeah
[4:55:53] <stratfel112> revenge had its moments, menace had maul and it's score and attack of the clones...yeah i got nothing
[4:56:02] <CursedNobleman> i havent seen rebuild. im echoing statements LUL
[4:56:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> @CursedNobleman I just want her to not have arm-noodles, she shouldn't have that much upper body strength with those shoulders.
[4:56:13] <+Dresdran> Episode 2 has the animated series.
[4:56:20] <LunarRemix> It can be fixed on the PC.
[4:56:20] <CaptainFrankincense> yeah
[4:56:24] <LunarRemix> Everything can be fixed on the PC.
[4:56:25] <+UnwoundCaesar70> PORN
[4:56:27] <TonberryLives> Butts
[4:56:27] <stfn893> Is this gonna get a pc
[4:56:31] <+Neoripo> I think if they stick the landing, the remake FF7 games will be ok
[4:56:39] <+aspirationdeath> @huntercd conflict. discovering that they are siblings is a lot less dramatic if there is nothing about the revelation that creates conflict
[4:56:42] <HyperBomb21> I want Tifa to put me ina headlock
[4:56:49] <+Dresdran> The fluff I can understand.
[4:56:52] <suitangi021> @Neoripo that's the third time I've heard someone say that. I've seen rebuild but I'm not drawing the line of comparison
[4:56:59] <CursedNobleman> we do nithing but fluff nowadays LUL
[4:57:03] <+Dresdran> Hell, giving more context, character, and backstory makes things interesting.
[4:57:05] <stfn893> People are really eating up the fluff
[4:57:08] <+Dresdran> The other stuff...
[4:57:09] <%Samex_Comex> April moon
[4:57:11] <+Dresdran> Well, its only begun.
[4:57:14] <stfn893> And thats okay
[4:57:24] <HyperBomb21> I kinda like the fluff.
[4:57:28] <PsychicKirby> @CursedNobleman fair point LUL
[4:57:42] <arkv01> that bed looks righteous
[4:58:02] <Run44forrest> 5Head
[4:58:03] <%Samex_Comex> You don't sleep
[4:58:04] <TonberryLives> EXACTLY
[4:58:08] <LunarRemix> Are you for real?
[4:58:08] <PsychicKirby> THANK YOU!
[4:58:10] <%Bacon_Rage> true
[4:58:11] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Plagues Right
[4:58:14] <LunarRemix> It looks ugly.
[4:58:15] <HyperBomb21> I make my bed because it's Aesthetic
[4:58:15] <SchroedingersFerret> Or Pat
[4:58:15] <arkv01> foolishness, you only regenerate
[4:58:17] <Tornadobear> It's more for if you have people over
[4:58:19] <CaptainFrankincense> i love the cube
[4:58:21] <CursedNobleman> or if you have a signifcant other that complains about your unmade bed LUL
[4:58:23] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Wait what are we talking about
[4:58:38] <CaptainFrankincense> no dont look down nooooo
[4:58:43] <Run44forrest> it looks like a jpeg
[4:58:56] <stfn893> I dont even want them to see my bed
[4:58:57] <corpsegoo> cubes are nice to sleep in, but god, I do not have the time or patience to maintain a cube
[4:58:59] <HyperBomb21> it probably is
[4:59:06] <JohnClaggart> making your bed or having more than one pillow is dumb
[4:59:06] <Explodincatz> i love Jpeg City
[4:59:07] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[4:59:07] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague doesn't care about us chat :(
[4:59:08] <LunarRemix> But didn't your mother beat into you a sense to do the right thing!?
[4:59:16] <KaiserMario> Jesus always knows
[4:59:17] <HyperBomb21> You know, this Remake is actually pretty faithful to the ps1. it makes use of pre-rendered backgrounds
[4:59:19] <arkv01> jesus will never want to touch my wee wee again :(
[4:59:21] <LunarRemix> Mine did to me.
[4:59:21] <CaptHat211> Excuse you, Plague?
[4:59:22] <Mr_Strut> judging you
[4:59:23] <+whiskey_wolfe_> A bed needs to be comfy and not have any living thing in it except me. That's all it needs.
[4:59:28] <TonberryLives> Jesus? No far worse. SANTA
[4:59:48] <HyperBomb21> Santa sucks
[4:59:53] <Triblade1992> Santa is ALWAYS watching
[5:00:01] <%Samex_Comex> Look up her skirt
[5:00:12] <CursedNobleman> Jeff Bezos cares about me BibleThump
[5:00:16] <PsychicKirby> My parents tried to teach me to make my bed, and it worked. But then I got on my own.
[5:01:09] <Naho_Saenoki> Apparently, making your bed is actually less hygienic than not. Something about it being a better environment for dust mites, which contributes to allergy and asthsma problems.
[5:01:35] <suikudo> THANK YOU
[5:01:35] <CursedNobleman> i just nest on my best like a condor
[5:01:42] <corpsegoo> the skirt is cute though
[5:01:42] <CursedNobleman> nest on my bed*
[5:01:47] <+Neoripo> @suitangi021 EVA rebuild is like a retelling of the old series but with differing outcomes. Except that there are a lot of subtle (and not so subtle) details pointing at the movies happening AFTER the series. Original series sea was normal them turned red in the ending. In the rebuild sea is red from the start
[5:01:48] <HyperBomb21> Safety shorts are for more refined men of culture
[5:01:48] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Skorts are back in season
[5:01:55] <suikudo> God i can always count on Plague to say some real ass shit
[5:01:58] <CursedNobleman> spats.
[5:02:06] <@Nightbot> @notanegg8 -> Are you finished? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[5:02:31] <+Neoripo> yep
[5:02:42] <arkv01> ehm cheaper reak estate
[5:02:54] <PsychicKirby> Taalk'n bout that slum realestate
[5:03:13] <+Dresdran> Slum Dog Midgardair
[5:03:24] <CursedNobleman> 2000 gil is approx $20. i wonder how much real estate is worth in FF7 LUL
[5:03:27] <PsychicKirby> LUL LUL LUL
[5:03:27] <%Samex_Comex> I hope they have giant light bulbs
[5:03:41] <sosuke5> sometimes
[5:03:43] <CaptainFrankincense> i might oooooo
[5:03:44] <+Neoripo> Always
[5:03:45] <HyperBomb21> Abocve my bed
[5:03:46] <TonberryLives> Of course
[5:03:47] <+Dresdran> Emergency supplies.
[5:03:49] <arkv01> just in case
[5:03:50] <%JailShmixRemix> Adventures need potions too
[5:03:51] <Triblade1992> Hey someone just found out on Hard mode in NG+, you can't use items at all during battle or outside of it. Just Materia.
[5:03:51] <CursedNobleman> no, they have to loot my fridge.
[5:03:54] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yes
[5:03:55] <LunarRemix> Yeah along with my tape recordings.
[5:03:56] <Ynkubus18> nah, just a mimic
[5:03:59] <$doomp12> no I don't geo cache
[5:04:00] <PsychicKirby> It's better than them coming in and breaking all your pots.
[5:04:01] <%Bacon_Rage> i try to have my treasure hidden from the main charaters camera
[5:04:03] <+ninja_galt> It would be cool if FF had mimics
[5:04:03] <Explodincatz> i make my chests into Mimics
[5:04:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> First aid kits. Random boxes full of supplies.
[5:04:10] <+0ni0n_L0rd> ect
[5:04:16] <arkv01> good job poochie!
[5:04:17] <+arancet> no, but some shit kid keeps throwing around my pottery
[5:04:18] <notanegg8> if people want free stuff from me they have to kill me for my drops
[5:04:22] <Triblade1992> NOPE
[5:04:32] <+Neoripo> That is ridiculous
[5:04:35] <Triblade1992> NOT ONCE
[5:04:38] <Explodincatz> thats stupid
[5:04:42] <sadboy_otoroshi> They should get burns by being that close to artificial suns.
[5:04:49] <Triblade1992> Materia only for a Hard mode run
[5:05:06] <+Neoripo> Hair physics
[5:05:09] <CursedNobleman> Numbers and Pain =/= Difficulty! LUL
[5:05:11] <Sol_Install> true
[5:05:18] <arkv01> she uses umbrella hair products
[5:05:33] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Oh she has money. Just don't ask how she gets it.
[5:05:36] <PsychicKirby> I know it's probably for game play, but they let the wildlife get all up on their reactors.
[5:05:36] <+aspirationdeath> its all orphan lard
[5:05:45] <Triblade1992> The "no items run" reminds me of that stupid "No items secret dungeon" from FF15 and hated that crap
[5:06:02] <CursedNobleman> no reactor maintenance crews LUL
[5:06:18] <%Samex_Comex> Maybe that magic metra matra stuff is a good conditioner?
[5:06:18] <JohnClaggart> it increases the amount it'll be used
[5:06:51] <PsychicKirby> Tifa uses Herbal Essence
[5:07:24] <+Neoripo> To be honest, the plate is so ridiculously huge in this game that seems normal for wildlife to start inhabiting relatively abandoned zones of it
[5:07:25] <suikudo> LUL
[5:07:26] <Run44forrest> paige of gripes
[5:07:33] <+MisterMusashi> sbfpPatschwitz
[5:07:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> How close it Plague to Paige?
[5:07:35] <CursedNobleman> SwiftRage leave her on read
[5:07:37] <%Bacon_Rage> stay at home blues jermaPluto
[5:07:45] <graemecrackers2> I hope we see yuffie
[5:07:52] <+MisterMusashi> they're powered down, they OBVIOUSLY won't come back online lilyFine
[5:07:56] <+SPplayer> how linear has the game been so far?
[5:08:03] <CursedNobleman> @graemecrackers2 youre too old for yuffie probably LUL
[5:08:04] <+Neoripo> They don't have juice
[5:08:19] <+MisterMusashi> mendoHuh
[5:08:21] <Run44forrest> he saw it on facebook
[5:08:25] <graemecrackers2> Damn ok
[5:08:31] <+ninja_galt> barret is a prophet, he hears the cries of the earth
[5:08:38] <PsychicKirby> @SPplayer From what I've seen it's pretty linear.
[5:08:39] <sadboy_otoroshi> Retroactive Storytelling plage....
[5:08:41] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It was new info back then
[5:08:45] <notanegg8> this will never elevate you to the level of gackt
[5:09:04] <+ninja_galt> gaktophobia
[5:09:07] <stratfel112> Barrett whats that in your turret hand is that the script?
[5:09:09] <+MisterRockett> Isn't Barret's hometown like, the first place that got SUPER fucked up by Shinra? He probably physically SAW it.
[5:09:12] <corpsegoo> Gast sure was elevated with that point blank shotgun
[5:09:14] <LunarRemix> For all we know Barret could be full of bullshit and just making stuff up.
[5:09:23] <arkv01> yeah that is rooough
[5:09:28] <+justianxix> it would look better if it was night
[5:09:35] <Triblade1992> Plus Unreal Engine 4 as well
[5:09:42] <+MisterMusashi> Just make it for PC, Squeenix stripREE
[5:09:44] <arkv01> I guess if you take aijr pollution into account
[5:09:46] <Run44forrest> 6
[5:09:49] <CaptainFrankincense> its fine but its poo poo
[5:09:51] <+anhero64> ehh...aigh/10
[5:09:59] <Triblade1992> Kind of a 4/10 then?
[5:10:07] <notanegg8> i rate this a doo doo out of poo poo
[5:10:11] <stfn893> THis game has high resd textured urinals
[5:10:18] <+SPplayer> @PsychicKirby how has it worked out so far? do you just run down a tunnel and get into scripted fights?
[5:10:22] <+Neoripo> could have been a super-low res model hidden with fog
[5:10:37] <PsychicKirby> At least it's not chugging like Dark Souls and Blight Town?
[5:11:00] <+ninja_galt> It's a skybox texture, no geometry in that town below at all
[5:11:06] <+Dresdran> Quadruple tapping.
[5:11:31] <xGeneralDOOM> barret the new plato Kappa
[5:11:31] <Triblade1992> #Barrethive
[5:11:33] <arkv01> thats a good daddy
[5:11:35] <CursedNobleman> MODERN GAME DESIGN. LUL
[5:11:42] <+Neoripo> Daddy Barret
[5:11:44] <CursedNobleman> reuse assets in mazes
[5:11:45] <PsychicKirby> @SPplayer Some areas have you move around locally doing side-quests, but when you hit progression it's linear.
[5:11:58] <+Dresdran> If they had stuck to FF7 it would be pretty good.
[5:12:06] <Triblade1992> @Dresdran
[5:12:06] <stfn893> For a remakes sake it fills all the boxes
[5:12:07] <graemecrackers2> Story time is big picture
[5:12:07] <+Dresdran> But they didn't.
[5:12:24] <+Dresdran> Stuck with the overall arch.
[5:12:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Yeah continuity condoms were actually dumb
[5:12:46] <stfn893> uh uh uh no no no
[5:12:47] <xGeneralDOOM> but everybody knows the story
[5:12:54] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Plot Ghosts are so clunky and ill-fitting that they MUST be someone's passion project.
[5:12:55] <sadboy_otoroshi> They have to behave like humans acting instead of characters whose medium is a box of text that gets read like a script.
[5:12:58] <CaptainFrankincense> changebad ghosts
[5:13:00] <LunarRemix> Wouldn't that be creatively bad for the creators?
[5:13:00] <Johnmaddened> but the expectations HAVE to be subverted!
[5:13:00] <HyperBomb21> I think they're too scared of botching a 1:1 Remake of FF7
[5:13:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:13:05] <+Neoripo> Instead of ghosts, some weird scenes to give a clue that some thing was going on
[5:13:16] <Triblade1992> @Dresdran The problem is that if they diid that, they would have to start cutting things. And the creators didn't want to cut things
[5:13:20] <CursedNobleman> red13 on the boat! LUL
[5:13:26] <LunarRemix> Like, if you had the option to go back to one of your works and told you could change some stuffs, wouldn't you?
[5:13:32] <Huntercd> Like Red in a uniform
[5:13:33] <hcsarg1986> You missed item boxes
[5:13:46] <+MisterRockett> I like the idea of plot ghost making sure the story is told correctly because when told in a more cinematic, realistic lens and expanded upon, some aspects of the plot don't make sense.
[5:13:53] <HyperBomb21> This is a big section
[5:13:54] <CursedNobleman> @LunarRemix most people would say their old shit is crap and not do anything
[5:14:02] <Huntercd> But then again people put clothes on dogs all the time
[5:14:03] <stratfel112> Great pacing this game has
[5:14:06] <+ninja_galt> Tifa Lockhart cat girl fan art when?
[5:14:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> Does Plague even read chat at all?
[5:14:16] <+MisterRockett> Like, yeah why DIDN'T Jessie and Wedge come with you on this second attack? I honestly forget if that's ever brought up.
[5:14:28] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Plot Ghosts are almost certainly the new Cloaked Figures that end up being Sephiroth clones acting under his influence. He's just being more direct this time.
[5:14:54] <xGeneralDOOM> LUL
[5:14:55] <Explodincatz> haha
[5:14:55] <CursedNobleman> DETOUR
[5:14:59] <Run44forrest> hahahahahahaha
[5:15:02] <HyperBomb21> JEBAITED
[5:15:03] <stfn893> Not for you, yet
[5:15:16] <HyperBomb21> It's a very good materia too
[5:15:19] <Run44forrest> cloud can jump that
[5:15:20] <arkv01> it's so pwetty...
[5:15:24] <sadboy_otoroshi> "The shortest route is a detour"
[5:15:30] <Triblade1992> "give me that materia! Don't video game me!" - Plague of Gripes
[5:15:35] <+ninja_galt> one materia to rule them all
[5:15:39] <stratfel112> just jedi jump over the chasm of death
[5:15:40] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Cutscene Cloud could make that jump
[5:15:45] <PsychicKirby> I think that I would enjoy this system more, but maybe I'll watch an FF7 playthrough to get perspective.
[5:15:52] <%Samex_Comex> Ahhh flying fish!
[5:16:10] <HyperBomb21> m o i s t
[5:16:16] <Run44forrest> nah gameplay cloud has like a 12 foot vertical
[5:16:19] <CursedNobleman> a tonna people did recent FF7 playthroughs
[5:16:23] <PsychicKirby> LUL
[5:16:25] <notanegg8> yeah it depends on whether you're more in the mood to play an action game or a turn-based rpg
[5:16:31] <xGeneralDOOM> Mutant magical fish
[5:17:00] <CursedNobleman> cat piss! LUL
[5:17:03] <Huntercd> Just use pee
[5:17:39] <sadboy_otoroshi> That mercury poisoning.
[5:17:39] <+MisterMusashi> Tifa is the real damage
[5:17:43] <+MisterMusashi> rooGasm
[5:17:51] <PsychicKirby> "Cloud what can you asses about the enemy?" "IT'S A FISH!"
[5:17:57] <hcsarg1986> Please get the item boxes
[5:18:16] <TomFrank> PISS
[5:18:18] <arkv01> I think tifa was designed to be fun for button mashers AND technical players
[5:18:20] <%Rezca> Smelling Piss is just not as marketable as Smelling Salts
[5:18:38] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He slapped Janet once and that's all he's known for.
[5:18:42] <xGeneralDOOM> more like hank pimp Kappa
[5:18:42] <Triblade1992> And make Ultron too Plague
[5:18:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Then Mark Millar turns him into a fucking psycho.
[5:18:49] <Triblade1992> So he did TWO fuck ups
[5:18:50] <hcsarg1986> He hit her by accident though
[5:18:54] <%JailShmixRemix> NO FEAR
[5:18:55] <HyperBomb21> NO SAFETY STANDARDS
[5:18:55] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Hey that was only the Ultimate universe I think
[5:18:59] <stratfel112> Hank Pym also created ultron which MCU Tony made instead
[5:19:00] <+Neoripo> Flanderization
[5:19:07] <Huntercd> Plus Barret only has one arm
[5:19:08] <CursedNobleman> SwiftRage OSHAAAAA!
[5:19:08] <sadboy_otoroshi> @arkv01 She as giver ; )
[5:19:13] <Run44forrest> barrett youre the heaviest

[5:19:45] <Triblade1992> Hank Pym: Beats his wife while creating killer sentient AI robots like Ultron
[5:19:46] <Rodzzila> Tifa character always looked boring to me. But her animations look amazing
[5:19:46] <+Dresdran> I was kind of hoping Cloud would just walk normally.
[5:19:46] <xGeneralDOOM> 5Head
[5:19:48] <Run44forrest> 🤔
[5:19:53] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud thinks he can survive the fall
[5:19:57] <TomFrank> hes brave enough to admit hes afraid
[5:20:02] <Run44forrest> NOOO
[5:20:03] <ahaegotrigger> Fair enough
[5:20:08] <arkv01> oooh thats a big jpeg

[5:20:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Spats are cute! CUTE!
[5:20:37] <+Punishedkaiger> But Plague, they're form fitting shorts
[5:20:40] <%Samex_Comex> I like shorts
[5:20:42] <+Dresdran> Cloud really is dumb fearless.
[5:20:56] <Run44forrest> clumbo
[5:21:02] <xstormyone> But it is absolute territory
[5:21:06] <ahaegotrigger> nice
[5:21:09] <+0ni0n_L0rd> That's fine too
[5:21:11] <+Dresdran> The best.

[5:21:13] <+lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[5:21:15] <CaptainFrankincense> enough for me
[5:21:15] <+Punishedkaiger> That's even better
[5:21:15] <Run44forrest> i can work with that
[5:21:16] <+MisterRockett> hawt

[5:21:18] <jbrachob> hot
[5:21:19] <arkv01> yes, just like this Kreygasm
[5:21:22] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Or she's just got a meaty dong.
[5:21:22] <+0ni0n_L0rd> They are
[5:21:25] <TalisKanju> Orthopedic Underwear maybe?
[5:21:26] <+MisterRockett> What if she's wearing the Shota briefs?
[5:21:28] <CursedNobleman> plague, the guys in chat probably havent seen an unrelated woman in a month LUL
[5:21:31] <Run44forrest> hasLost
[5:21:33] <+lethallylactic> Spats are erotic Kappa
[5:21:33] <+Neoripo> Orthopedic panties
[5:21:34] <stratfel112> what if tifa pads her chest?
[5:21:36] <+MisterMusashi> also I remember you saw them for sure in the pre-rendered cutscene when the big explosion happened when they wer eon the deck of the Highwind, the one with the super jiggle physics
[5:21:48] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Stop BAITING ME into looking at your SPATS, thot
[5:21:58] <+MisterMusashi> at the time, it was the best pre-rendered cutscene of jiggles of all time
[5:22:11] <arkv01> uh tifa whoa
[5:22:26] <Triblade1992> Tifa does a lot of research
[5:22:29] <Run44forrest> i thought she was making fun of barrett
[5:22:30] <%Samex_Comex> We parked the car at H0 -1
[5:22:32] <arkv01> I did get a fear boner
[5:22:33] <+MisterMusashi> Manly voice Tifa rooGasm
[5:22:35] <TalisKanju> Screw Jessie, Tifa is the REAL actress
[5:22:47] <+Neoripo> President Tifa is the best
[5:22:52] <PsychicKirby> Little known fact that Tifa does mean impressions.
[5:23:01] <+MisterMusashi> Purple anda blue
[5:23:03] <arkv01> tifa is MY president (queen)
[5:23:10] <Run44forrest> jessies just a stage hand FeelsBadMan
[5:23:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> they run off battery
[5:23:24] <sadboy_otoroshi> run of
[5:24:16] <%JailShmixRemix> "Watch and learn" "I'll hang back"
[5:24:19] <+MisterMusashi> Barret is in an endless cycle of trying to save face
[5:24:27] <Triblade1992> I miss the integration of buffs and debuffs in combat like 10 and 13. I loved it when the game forced me to actual rethink my strategies.
[5:24:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> Talk shit get hit Barret.
[5:25:07] <PsychicKirby> I-is Cloud the Leon Kennedy of the group?
[5:25:32] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud is the Squall of the group
[5:25:33] <Triblade1992> He exudes the "No way ***" energy when itt comes to the girls
[5:25:41] <Triblade1992> Jail. no
[5:25:46] <%JailShmixRemix> lol
[5:25:52] <PsychicKirby> That's what I'm saying
[5:26:01] <thepiefoot> Why does Tifa squint so much ?
[5:26:54] <sadboy_otoroshi> @thepiefoot she's Asian
[5:27:08] <PsychicKirby> Tifa's just show'n some cleavage and Cloud's haing none of it.
[5:27:55] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud's just too embarrassed to do anything about it
[5:28:11] <notanegg8> the voice crack really sold that "mostly"
[5:28:21] <LunarRemix> I think in some extra material they say Soldiers are steriles.
[5:28:21] <sad_toast_> RE4 Leon
[5:28:24] <%caramello_man> leon is more sassy
[5:28:26] <PsychicKirby> LOL
[5:28:28] <Triblade1992> "No way BRO!" - Cloud Strife
[5:28:33] <siient_one> Hello. how long have you been playing?
[5:28:36] <LunarRemix> So that's a reason why Cloud is kind slow with girls.
[5:28:38] <+MisterMusashi> My question is - where are Tifa's abs?
[5:28:38] <stratfel112> but does cloud have one liners?
[5:28:50] <arkv01> cloud's more like "This is a bathtub and I am not having fun"
[5:29:16] <%Samex_Comex> Leon talking with Salazar is the best
[5:29:17] <sad_toast_> cloud is short for "Chasity belt"
[5:29:24] <PsychicKirby> @statfel112 "I'm not your bro, bro.
[5:29:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> @MisterMusashi where our hopes and dreams are, nowhere to be seen.
[5:29:36] <PsychicKirby> Cloud
[5:29:43] <sad_toast_> I'm not your buddie guy
[5:30:02] <Triblade1992> @arkv01 Oh no I just remembered that dumb comic parody of Ada and Leon recreating the lifeguard porno parody.
[5:30:04] <notanegg8> speen
[5:30:06] <SuperVaderMan> they try spinning, because it's a good trick
[5:30:14] <arkv01> that's the one :)
[5:30:30] <sad_toast_> SPIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
[5:30:34] <Triblade1992> @arkv01 "We aren't at the beach" -Leon Kennedy to Lifeguard Ada Wong
[5:30:37] <Rodzzila> There is water in the clouds, that aquatic enough Kappa
[5:30:58] <SuperVaderMan> good, Barret
[5:30:58] <+MisterMusashi> gennaLUL
[5:31:04] <sad_toast_> @supervaderman VADER man would use a star wars reference
[5:31:10] <notanegg8> tifa should be the one who does that
[5:31:47] <+MisterMusashi> I want this game to come out on PC so people can mod Tifa to have chiseled abs
[5:31:52] <PsychicKirby> Actual could earlier in the game: "I HAVE SKILLS!!!"
[5:32:01] <Run44forrest> lmao
[5:32:02] <PsychicKirby> *Cloud
[5:32:02] <+MisterRockett> @notanegg8 Why? She's not the high energy chipper one. That'd be Aerith.
[5:32:24] <+MisterMusashi> go back I think, thjere was something else? anuThink
[5:32:32] <notanegg8> @MisterRockett because it would be cute!!!
[5:32:36] <+Neoripo> You can always check the map
[5:32:37] <+MisterMusashi> oh
[5:32:44] <Run44forrest> didnt tifa have abs in one of the trailers
[5:32:46] <LunarRemix> More money means better crossdressing clothes.
[5:32:54] <+MisterMusashi> I think there was another way near that switch
[5:32:58] <LunarRemix> That's the real endgame.
[5:33:06] <+MisterRockett> @notanegg8 fair
[5:33:16] <+MisterRockett> @notanegg8 wait is it not cute when barret does it?
[5:33:26] <HelghastTroop> wait theres more than one sword in this i didnt even know that
[5:33:30] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:33:31] <notanegg8> @MisterRockett well sure but i'm not horny for that one
[5:33:46] <HelghastTroop> i laways thought that he only carried the one sword the whole time
[5:33:57] <Sol_Install> nice pun
[5:34:10] <+Dresdran> Some rich guy with too much money.
[5:34:20] <%Samex_Comex> Mr Burns
[5:34:20] <+Dresdran> I always assumed the slums were undergroud.
[5:34:22] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's not a problem until you try to overrationalize it.
[5:34:23] <PsychicKirby> Couldn't possibly cause problems.
[5:34:25] <TonberryLives> Because METAPHORS
[5:34:25] <TalisKanju> Why do they have giant sun lamps in the first place?
[5:34:39] <+Dresdran> Built into an existing cavern network or something.
[5:34:39] <TalisKanju> Why not just expand the city?
[5:34:52] <Huntercd> Building up for lack of space? Or it's like that in Japan?
[5:35:11] <+whiskey_wolfe_> There's so much space though.
[5:35:16] <sadboy_otoroshi> @PlagueOfGripes In order to have a distopic society.
[5:35:20] <TalisKanju> In the original Midgar is like in the middle of nowhere
[5:35:32] <+Dresdran> I'm reminded of Hong Kong from the Deus Ex games.
[5:35:40] <+Neoripo> Cities built on top of other cities do exist. They just.. buried the old city instead of keeping it
[5:35:50] <Huntercd> The devs are Japanese so that's their reference point?
[5:36:01] <arkv01> shhh dont ask
[5:36:25] <CursedNobleman> this is dieselpunk shadowrun
[5:36:40] <PsychicKirby> Don't get Barret started about how Shinra holds themselves above others.
[5:36:43] <+MisterMusashi> Two big ladies
[5:37:13] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Two Queens? Yaaaaaaaasss.
[5:37:25] <Huntercd> If Shinra mades so much money why are they so cheap?
[5:37:25] <Triblade1992> Barrettt is a loveable bastard
[5:37:41] <Rodzzila> ESPECIALLY if they are dumb animals
[5:38:12] <stratfel112> "Mind over matter!!!" *Death sounds*
[5:38:26] <arkv01> these monster redesigns are horrifying
[5:38:28] <+Neoripo> I guess building a raised city keeps non-flying monsters at bay. Or that might have been the theory
[5:38:43] <arkv01> just throw these bad boys into RE4 remake
[5:38:51] <Huntercd> They have 40k-esque bug horrors in their infastructure
[5:38:56] <sadboy_otoroshi> In the original game, was the buster sword the weakest weapon tha cloud used or you could upgrade it?
[5:39:09] <MKUltima> Buster was the starter weapon and weakest
[5:39:20] <%JailShmixRemix> F

[5:39:59] <LunarRemix> And the worst part is that you couldn't even sell it.
[5:40:01] <+Neoripo> still you cold not sell it
[5:40:13] <sadboy_otoroshi> @Neoripo oof
[5:40:53] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> use cactuar

[5:44:06] <+Solid_Stro> psaUp
[5:44:29] <sadboy_otoroshi> Imagine how fun this game would be with friendly fire (i fear that square inflates the difficulty by doing this)
[5:44:57] <LunarRemix> Literally at the end of the game
[5:44:57] <Huntercd> I hope dog is in this
[5:44:59] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> meh
[5:45:54] <mrgaster8> BibleThump
[5:46:08] <Triblade1992> nope
[5:46:09] <mrgaster8> no
[5:46:20] <%JailShmixRemix> You have two lightnings?
[5:46:32] <Glassbrain> Lightning like ff13. Haha get it because hallway design and staggering battle mechanics?
[5:46:36] <LunarRemix> But there's Air now, right?
[5:46:44] <LunarRemix> Air wasn't in the original game I think.
[5:46:47] <ValenAlvernYT> Aero is in but Quake is out, lame
[5:46:51] <Glassbrain> Get it? I’m aggressively trying to see if you get it.
[5:46:53] <Triblade1992> I think earth will show up in the next game
[5:47:35] <sadboy_otoroshi> @MisterMusashi September?
[5:47:53] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> well if you change a letter in the aeris name it becomes air in spanish
[5:48:29] <+Solid_Stro> I prefer Aerif doodMako
[5:48:31] <ValenAlvernYT> Did they keep Bio? I always liked using that one
[5:48:48] <Glassbrain> So is this as much of a series of fight arenas joined by hallways as it looks?
[5:50:01] <sadboy_otoroshi> You can change their approach in commands i think?
[5:50:06] <Triblade1992> Beyblade, let it RIP
[5:50:20] <@Nightbot> @MisterMusashi -> AAhhh... much better! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[5:50:34] <+MisterMusashi> Reee, I only used 4 emotes woopsTsun
[5:50:36] <%JailShmixRemix> Good nightbot
[5:50:43] <+MisterMusashi> I just did 4 rooGun emotes
[5:50:53] <mrgaster8> lol
[5:51:01] <%JailShmixRemix> 0 emotes is the maximum
[5:51:14] <Glassbrain> Nightbot demands blood.
[5:51:18] <Triblade1992> nightbot going on a rampage with no survivors
[5:51:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> No fun allowed!

[5:52:47] <%Samex_Comex> What?
[5:52:48] <sadboy_otoroshi> LUL
[5:52:50] <+MisterRockett> You have to go on a DATE WITH HER
[5:52:50] <%JailShmixRemix> You think they will ever explain the continuity condom ghosts?
[5:52:52] <Triblade1992> Nomura's wild KIINO ride
[5:52:59] <kingra> That's not fucking real
[5:53:01] <Thenuclearwalrus> LUL
[5:53:03] <+arancet> and they created a massive disruption to do that
[5:53:04] <+lethallylactic> Final Fantasy 7: Rebuild LUL
[5:53:04] <+Dresdran> It really is dumb.
[5:53:06] <LunarRemix> That's some Xehanort tier shit and I love it!
[5:53:06] <ahaegotrigger> True
[5:53:08] <+MisterRockett> You have to have AVALANCHE ADVENTURES
[5:53:09] <+MisterMusashi> So time shenanigans is the theme of the remake?
[5:53:16] <CaptHat211> Nomura: I r riter
[5:53:20] <EuropanLamprey> Just got here and Plague's bitching, how onbrand
[5:53:22] <vonmaultke> FF7: ravaged
[5:53:24] <+Dresdran> FF7R, prepare to be confused edition.
[5:53:26] <Victory_Boss> Cloud needs to beat the time ghosts so Aerith won't die
[5:53:28] <Triblade1992> What Lunar said! Nomura wild Kino Ride!
[5:53:29] <notanegg8> no no no it's all gonna come together and make perfect sense nomura's kino. he's gackted
[5:53:44] <EuropanLamprey> PREPARE FOR THE TIME JANNIES!
[5:53:47] <+Dresdran> Kuno doesn't care!
[5:53:50] <+MisterMusashi> Yeah I get the feeling they're gonna try to change the timeline
[5:54:09] <+MisterMusashi> Twitch Plays FF7R, there, Plague
[5:54:10] <+Urgoslav> how do walk
[5:54:23] <Triblade1992> I think there has to be something to allow the player for future titles to changes the direction of the story (branching)
[5:54:27] <+Solid_Stro> Cloud doesn’t push Sephiroth down the hole, ghosts do. doodDerp
[5:54:29] <stratfel112> Like i said great pacing
[5:54:30] <%caramello_man> you wont remember this area probably
[5:54:35] <arkv01> sakaguchi disowned, gackt is my new dad now :)
[5:54:55] <Explodincatz> wasnt that the case in the original?
[5:55:03] <TonberryLives> No I don't
[5:55:06] <+MisterMusashi> Ghosts go up Aerith's butt zentreDerp
[5:55:09] <ahaegotrigger> I felt that
[5:55:12] <Explodincatz> forgetting how bad areas were?
[5:55:16] <Triblade1992> I don't see linear as the problem. directionless is the real problem
[5:55:24] <Triblade1992> That can get annoying
[5:55:37] <Run44forrest> PogChamp
[5:55:44] <+MisterMusashi> zoneSweat
[5:55:45] <ahaegotrigger> yeah sure
[5:55:45] <+MisterMusashi> uhhh
[5:55:52] <+MisterMusashi> I know they have "section ending" confirmation
[5:55:58] <ahaegotrigger> Barret makes me question it
[5:55:58] <+SPplayer> I think id say yes, just to be sure
[5:56:01] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes This seems very aggressive about the "points of no return"
[5:56:02] <+MisterMusashi> but that's weird to have if you already got it
[5:56:03] <+Neoripo> Oh shit the summon!
[5:56:03] <+Daniel_Is_I> I feel like they wouldn't stop you if you grabbed it
[5:56:06] <stratfel112> thanks a lot barrett now we're here forever
[5:56:08] <+Solid_Stro> The one in the fan?
[5:56:10] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[5:56:10] <+Neoripo> You missed it!
[5:56:16] <Omnislash195> There is a summon materia, isn't there?
[5:56:26] <Triblade1992> They do that with Tifa too.
[5:56:32] <sadboy_otoroshi> Seriou question: ¿How hard would be for a writer to make a story for a videogame, i know that the show not tell is very successful, but often enough rpg and games with no lineal progression get the short end in this regard? you opinisons chat.
[5:56:33] <+lethallylactic> Ah yes, there is one you missed.
[5:56:38] <Triblade1992> Yes you did
[5:56:38] <+Neoripo> yes
[5:56:42] <EuropanLamprey> You don't get this message if you get everything
[5:56:42] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes nooo shit my chat fucked up, you messed a summon materia

[6:03:07] <+MisterMusashi> Theeeere we go
[6:03:09] <+Deakirino> Yes!
[6:03:12] <+MisterMusashi> that's gotta be it
[6:03:17] <%JailShmixRemix> Chat sucks
[6:03:18] <+MisterMusashi> people wer ementioning that elevator
[6:03:18] <sad_toast_> eventually
[6:03:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> @EuropanLamprey "Life Goals"
[6:03:28] <Run44forrest> has5 🍷 mayhaps
[6:03:29] <JohnClaggart> plague is so smart
[6:03:40] <JohnClaggart> too smart
[6:03:42] <EuropanLamprey> Yes, that is completely it
[6:03:43] <+MisterMusashi> People kept trying to point out that lift woopsTsun
[6:03:43] <TonberryLives> Of course it is
[6:03:45] <+aspirationdeath> chat is mr af
[6:03:48] <+aspirationdeath> yep
[6:03:49] <+Deakirino> no, i got it on my run#
[6:03:51] <+MisterMusashi> Barret wtf
[6:03:53] <Apolonm> atpCap
[6:03:55] <+MisterMusashi> gennaLUL
[6:03:57] <EuropanLamprey> The entire chat is "One Guy"
[6:03:58] <%JailShmixRemix> Chat sajamErnie
[6:04:00] <+aspirationdeath> thats how chat operates
[6:04:00] <%hgtarras> I’ve haven’t played it so I’m not suggesting it
[6:04:00] <oniwahoo> Barret, dude LUL
[6:04:02] <Triblade1992> Barrett is just a gud boi
[6:04:12] <%hgtarras> brownBACKSEAT
[6:04:14] <+Punishedkaiger> He owns up to his silly shenanigans, it's great
[6:04:30] <scribbledguy> but I didn't say anything other than the "Gripe summon" I just made up ;-;
[6:04:32] <+Neoripo> Problem is, you where askin how to get it, and whe were responding from where to see it
[6:04:35] <sad_toast_> 🤦
[6:04:36] <corpsegoo> hope you like timed battles
[6:04:42] <EuropanLamprey> OH, it's this room, Plague will love this psaLiz
[6:04:45] <stratfel112> Barrett must make his presence known at all times it's the law
[6:05:06] <%JailShmixRemix> Its to increase efficiency
[6:05:13] <Johnmaddened> time them for maximum productivity
[6:05:14] <oniwahoo> Why are their pants around their ankles at work?
[6:05:15] <+LordSDB> I guess it's service or die
[6:05:22] <sad_toast_> just push button again it's fine probably
[6:05:27] <EuropanLamprey> Time is money, and Shinra is incredibly cheap apparently
[6:05:29] <corpsegoo> just win this battle then go back reset the timer and do it again, second round has weaker enemies than the first
[6:05:53] <+Neoripo> you can reset
[6:05:57] <stratfel112> cheese it times almost up
[6:06:04] <stevo_scar> enjoying?
[6:06:12] <sad_toast_> a time limit to service a giant dangerous industrial fan 😂🤣
[6:06:41] <Triblade1992> I thiiink it's to mess with fans
[6:06:42] <%JailShmixRemix> Yeah this seems pretty useless
[6:06:44] <+Neoripo> Shinra are assholes
[6:06:46] <EuropanLamprey> Gotta earn that cute chocobo
[6:06:58] <corpsegoo> a) spam blizzard b) just kill it without worry about the time limit, leave and come back to fight weaker enemies
[6:07:04] <Run44forrest> SourPls
[6:07:08] <%caramello_man> the game is actively making exploration difficult, amazing!
[6:07:09] <stratfel112> wait is there death animation of getting cut up by the fan?
[6:07:13] <stevo_scar> hes enjoying it
[6:07:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> The dangers of automation, doesn't take care of the bug infestations.
[6:07:14] <sad_toast_> @triblade1992 your not wrong it is to mess with the. Fan 🤔
[6:07:33] <CursedNobleman> engaging gameplay!
[6:07:34] <stevo_scar> he loves it
[6:07:35] <corpsegoo> I do not believe so, thank god
[6:07:41] <+Neoripo> That would be very stupid
[6:07:54] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes there is a bench in the control room. Take a rest there afterwards.
[6:07:56] <corpsegoo> very few things comeplete fuck you over for being bad the first time in this game from what I've seen
[6:07:58] <sad_toast_> it's just something to bang your head on a wall for a while 😃
[6:08:01] <Run44forrest> NotLikeThis
[6:08:05] <+aspirationdeath> i dont know. rewarding competence doesnt seem so bad lol
[6:08:07] <+SPplayer> that reminds me of the massage in FFX2, if you complete it on the first try, you get a worse item than if you get it the second try
[6:08:21] <stevo_scar> momentum?
[6:08:37] <oniwahoo> Don't you hate when you keep missing trying to touch a computer?
[6:08:49] <sadboy_otoroshi> @SPplayer bruh
[6:08:51] <%JailShmixRemix> then the materia falls off
[6:08:55] <+MisterMusashi> Yufie stole it gloryBustin
[6:08:59] <sad_toast_> slight momentum and wieght
[6:09:14] <Triblade1992> Barrett is gonna be disapoinited
[6:09:21] <scarboardalive> Hey Mr Gripes, big fan of your stuff
[6:09:29] <+Neoripo> Black man gets Chicken summon LUL
[6:09:29] <Mr_Strut> thicc chocobo
[6:09:33] <Triblade1992> I think the fat one is in the game
[6:09:46] <EuropanLamprey> Summons the fat chocobo and it instantly has a heart attack on the battledfield
[6:09:57] <sad_toast_> soooo it's better?
[6:10:18] <oniwahoo> @europanlamprey Well then you're guaranteed dinner at least
[6:10:19] <+MisterMusashi> At least there's a bench, too
[6:10:24] <+Daniel_Is_I> The garbage chocobo hiphop?
[6:10:27] <arkv01> 🐔
[6:10:41] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Looking forward to KPOP de Chocobo.
[6:10:41] <+MisterMusashi> I think you have but they didn't inflict it
[6:10:45] <+Neoripo> Nah, the good chocobo song
[6:11:07] <+Neoripo> Fishes inflicted sleep, but you destroyed them
[6:11:23] <+MisterMusashi> ^
[6:11:33] <sad_toast_> probably one uniform shop system
[6:11:45] <%Samex_Comex> This song always makes me think of old Legendary Frog cartoons
[6:11:46] <sadboy_otoroshi> Standard prices everywhere, the only thing good about a world government.
[6:12:35] <+Neoripo> it should?
[6:12:41] <+MisterMusashi> It says which elements the materia works it
[6:12:44] <+MisterMusashi> with*
[6:12:49] <+MisterMusashi> the blue one says it
[6:12:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:13:36] <sadboy_otoroshi> Poison being a good in a video game? in this day and age?
[6:14:24] <%JailShmixRemix> Chats always right?
[6:14:33] <Ynkubus18> nothing
[6:14:34] <oniwahoo> That Plague is salty at the fans?
[6:14:35] <Shutupandpick> pee is stored in the balls
[6:14:42] <CrowbarFacelift> look at the fan you'll figure it out
[6:14:43] <%caramello_man> plague is sooooooo smart
[6:14:53] <sadboy_otoroshi> Not to tell you things if actually don't know our shit.
[6:15:15] <JohnClaggart> i learned that habitualism is a crime
[6:15:25] <TheWe4pon> to be fair the path showed on the map i just didnt know that it was on a diffrent level
[6:15:34] <+Neoripo> it's problematic to guide someone when the map is so big, so you just point to the nearest landmark
[6:15:43] <+MisterMusashi> There is one later, I think
[6:16:00] <+MisterMusashi> In the frozen time anuDIO
[6:16:05] <Johnmaddened> vargDio
[6:16:07] <Triblade1992> I like the linear because the game shouldn't be forced to be open world. That would completely screw with the poinit of Midgar
[6:16:59] <EuropanLamprey> Wait, Plague gave lightning to cloud and chocobo to Berret too? Oh no, Plague is channeling Pat
[6:17:14] <notanegg8> tifa looks & sounds like she's really satisfying to play...
[6:19:03] <TalisKanju> Loading screen
[6:19:13] <sad_toast_> analogy??
[6:19:22] <+Rannos> barret is lowkey smart and lowkey dumb
[6:19:35] <Triblade1992> exactly
[6:19:43] <notanegg8> didn't know you shipped them, surprising
[6:19:46] <EuropanLamprey> Berret's a crazy conspiracy theorist who happens to be %100 right
[6:19:50] <+Solid_Stro> @rannos It’s a delicate balance
[6:19:52] <Triblade1992> Barrett is Earth, Aerith is Wind, Tifa is fiire
[6:19:56] <sad_toast_> LIGHTNING comes out of Clouds Duh 🙄 lol
[6:20:02] <+Neoripo> Plague is so right
[6:20:08] <EuropanLamprey> Oh no, he really is channeling Pat, that's exactly what he said
[6:20:11] <Mr_Strut> Ice works with cloud
[6:20:11] <sad_toast_> 🌩️🌩️🌩️
[6:20:47] <sad_toast_> ice comes out of Clouds too 🤔🌨️❄️
[6:20:51] <oniwahoo> Barret you tried to hug him with your giant gun arm
[6:21:01] <+Solid_Stro> Barrett gets no love
[6:21:09] <+Neoripo> hugs Barret
[6:21:26] <arkv01> damn these grapples are COOL
[6:21:28] <+Rannos> barrett has my favorite romance scene at the golden saucer
[6:21:39] <+Rannos> he just cannot sleep and asks if you wanna hang out
[6:21:40] <kuzokai> say you think if we didn't have all the additions, we would have met arith by now?
[6:21:50] <+MisterMusashi> stripHmm
[6:21:52] <+MisterMusashi> naaaah
[6:21:53] <sad_toast_> 🤔🤨😏
[6:21:55] <+MisterMusashi> that'd never happen
[6:22:02] <oniwahoo> I wonder what he could mean
[6:22:06] <+Solid_Stro> Not gonna happen
[6:22:09] <Triblade1992> Plague, you can't do that! The Change BAd ghosts won't let you!
[6:22:15] <Deviantviking6669> He talks about cloud dateing Marlen
[6:22:20] <arkv01> something something undying love for you spikyboy
[6:22:21] <+Rannos> you have to go out of your way to annoy several characters to get him.
[6:22:29] <sad_toast_> ghosts will catch him? 🤔🤷
[6:22:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> ¿Can someone explain me what's the deal with Orthopedic Underwear?
[6:22:36] <TheWe4pon> "Cloud i want you to fuck me in the butt"
[6:22:37] <arkv01> TARGET ON HONKERS
[6:22:39] <+Daniel_Is_I> Evil business man
[6:22:39] <arkv01> ACQUIRED
[6:22:43] <Johnmaddened> look at all those skin pores
[6:22:47] <Triblade1992> The Change Bad Ghosts would steal the grappling hooks
[6:22:50] <sad_toast_> WHATS THAT SMELL???!!!
[6:22:51] <+MisterMusashi> Heidegger is much less fat in the remake
[6:22:52] <Run44forrest> woopsHmm
[6:22:58] <oniwahoo> Shinra incompetence baby~
[6:23:10] <hcsarg1986> Arbiters of fate helped them I guess
[6:23:16] <Deviantviking6669> Plagues chat being weird? no.
[6:23:17] <+Rannos> not only that it got off the ground but that they seem to have taken the time to do it right.
[6:23:17] <sad_toast_> 🤣
[6:23:20] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes for 'the most fertile' she ought to have even bigger boobs
[6:23:22] <Triblade1992> LUL
[6:23:23] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hmmmm, what's that smellllll
[6:23:26] <+Rannos> I have only talked about my waifu barrett
[6:23:28] <Shutupandpick> I got some seeds need plantin
[6:23:28] <gordieda20> LUL
[6:23:29] <%Samex_Comex> :(
[6:23:31] <xGeneralDOOM> my dick dats why
[6:23:33] <notanegg8> just because she was scientifically engineered to invoke primal breeding instincts in all viewing subjects
[6:23:35] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> can we see the new gun?
[6:23:35] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Is it? BLOO-Mako
[6:23:35] <+Neoripo> It's the stomach zone. it's so toned
[6:23:35] <mizamar> who is she modeled after?
[6:23:38] <+MisterMusashi> If she had fur on her you would'nt be complaining lobosKek
[6:23:40] <@Nightbot> @scribbledguy -> Come on! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[6:23:41] <+UnwoundCaesar70> ay if you not simping for Tifa you a simp
[6:23:42] <thecrazyanbu> No love for Barrett? Modeled to be the most fertile man in the universe.
[6:23:44] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague said simp....?!
[6:23:44] <sad_toast_> where's muh chute?!?
[6:23:52] <+OneGorillionDollars> you cant stop the thirst, NONE OF YOU CAN
[6:24:06] <KaiserMario> Which one is more fertile? Tifa or Gwynevere?
[6:24:07] <oniwahoo> Remake Barret is fantastic
[6:24:10] <+Rannos> all of us are really simping on barrett to be fair.
[6:24:11] <Mr_Strut> We love ecoterrorism!
[6:24:29] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud's such a dork
[6:24:31] <+Solid_Stro> @plagueofgripes you either get to choose Tifa, the dead one, scary black man, or underaged girl.
[6:24:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Tifa is NOT the most fertile women ever. Too top heavy.
[6:24:32] <ValenAlvernYT> Barret and Tifa have fun, and Clouds like "eh, do this shit all the time"
[6:24:33] <arkv01> cloud's just screaming NO IM NOT A PUSSY
[6:24:39] <scribbledguy> Mmmm look at Barret's magnanimous buns dafranB
[6:24:40] <hcsarg1986> There's Tifa's chest :p
[6:24:40] <sadboy_otoroshi> wait no, they should have tripped in the tubes joints.
[6:24:46] <+Neoripo> same but blue
[6:24:48] <retardeddoggo> thought you were totalbiscuit for a second
[6:24:50] <sad_toast_> the moooney 💰💸💵
[6:24:51] <SonofStranger> why can't you choose marco #49
[6:24:54] <CyberDingus> no such thing as TOO BIG
[6:24:55] <Run44forrest> i want barrett to pop my head like a grape
[6:25:10] <arkv01> maybe we can hijack it like a gundam and wreck the reactor?
[6:25:21] <SonofStranger> I want barrett to crush my entire pelvis
[6:25:22] <TechDragon_Z> Why not disable the murder machine now just in case?
[6:25:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> She's 16 yeah.
[6:25:28] <+Neoripo> yes
[6:25:29] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[6:25:29] <Deviantviking6669> Yuffie is 15
[6:25:32] <vonmaultke> wouldn't it be smart to disable it now then?
[6:25:33] <retardeddoggo> if it bleeds it breeds
[6:25:35] <arkv01> "I did NOT kiss her officer, I did not"
[6:25:36] <sad_toast_> 🤪
[6:25:36] <notanegg8> i want tifa to bash my skull in, completely unprovoked and unwarranted
[6:25:36] <oniwahoo> How old is Cloud even?
[6:25:38] <Shutupandpick> Dnt 4get the new wepin
[6:25:40] <SonofStranger> It's legal in japan
[6:25:42] <Huntercd> Yuffie is 16
[6:25:43] <sadboy_otoroshi> In Italy.... ouh
[6:25:43] <ahaegotrigger> damn
[6:25:44] <+Solid_Stro> FBI!!!
[6:25:44] <KaiserMario> I wonder what Tifa does for her chronic back pain?
[6:25:45] <VERDAXY> RULE 34 IS ALL LEGAL
[6:25:45] <TalisKanju> The United States of Midgar
[6:25:46] <Deviantviking6669> Cloud 22
[6:25:50] <EuropanLamprey> But not in California, so it's still a universal sin
[6:25:50] <thecrazyanbu> Push it to the limit! Walk along the razor's edge
[6:25:50] <+MisterMusashi> Tifa is MOM Material lilyOkay
[6:25:52] <CyberDingus> her THIGHS are not THICK enough
[6:25:53] <xGeneralDOOM> 14 is legal here
[6:25:55] <%JailShmixRemix> Not legal in the big city
[6:25:55] <+LordSDB> Barett is the only thick one here
[6:25:55] <fluffy_sauce> wait, yuffie was one of the options for the date?
[6:25:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Perfectly legal!
[6:25:58] <+OneGorillionDollars> its never good when you have the say the "technically"
[6:25:59] <+aspirationdeath> legal dont mean moral
[6:26:02] <Huntercd> The legal age in Japan is 18
[6:26:08] <Mr_Strut> I cannot wait for the bimbo tifa mods on pc
[6:26:09] <JohnClaggart> you can date cait sith
[6:26:13] <Deviantviking6669> Yeah but Yuffie is hard to get for the date
[6:26:14] <%JailShmixRemix> @Huntercd depends on the prefecture
[6:26:25] <EuropanLamprey> @aspirationdeath That argument can do both ways, careful
[6:26:26] <+Rannos> good ole Z targeting though
[6:26:27] <retardeddoggo> reminder that the age of consent in nigeria is 11
[6:26:37] <fluffy_sauce> i thought it was only between, tifa, aeris and barret
[6:27:01] <+Rannos> that does sound like japan
[6:27:05] <%JailShmixRemix> ^
[6:27:09] <kingra> That sounds like something that happened
[6:27:09] <+Neoripo> so weird
[6:27:11] <Huntercd> It's all 18 I was stationed there. I also spoke to to Japanese nationals they confirmed it was 18
[6:27:12] <ahaegotrigger> the smell?
[6:27:13] <oniwahoo> I think that Korea had the same thing for a while
[6:27:14] <vonmaultke> From the moment you release your nut LUL
[6:27:25] <Shutupandpick> I thought that was a Chinese thing and the way I heard it, you were counted as 1 year old at your birth
[6:27:26] <sad_toast_> asking when a woman is due for birth is like asking "when y'all bang??!"
[6:27:27] <+aspirationdeath> @europanlamprey whos arguing for the morality of preying on the emotionally underdeveloped?
[6:27:31] <oniwahoo> Like you're technically born at 1
[6:27:45] <%JailShmixRemix> @Huntercd Interesting, thanks for informing me
[6:28:04] <+Neoripo> In the original FF7 this one also seemed newish due to not having broken parts
[6:28:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> Too bad that legal age doesn't reflect maturity but how much everyone is willing to deal with your mistakes.
[6:28:17] <SonofStranger> I believe minimum "age of consent" in Japan is 13, but "obscene acts" are illegal until you're 18
[6:28:19] <EuropanLamprey> @aspirationdeath Those who say it doesn't take until 18 for one to be emotionally developed
[6:28:44] <sad_toast_> idk man I don't mess with girls under 21 🤷
[6:28:57] <%JailShmixRemix> Factually the brain isn't fully developed until around 25
[6:29:05] <SonofStranger> The joke is well past suspension of disbelief at this point
[6:29:10] <xGeneralDOOM> @sad_toast_ DansGame
[6:29:21] <Run44forrest> @xGeneralDOOM daphWeird
[6:29:25] <arkv01> I don't fuck wit women under 30 :)
[6:29:34] <+aspirationdeath> @europanlamprey its more the age differential thats the determining factor
[6:29:38] <+Neoripo> 13 is nationwide, but region-side the age of consent (which overrules national) is always much higher
[6:29:46] <Triblade1992> At least he isn't showing up in person and not giving barrett the chance to just shoot
[6:29:53] <Triblade1992> him that is
[6:29:53] <desmond_whoa> Clearly not
[6:30:06] <EuropanLamprey> @aspirationdeath I'm just saying, Legal =/= Moral can work both ways
[6:30:22] <Triblade1992> "Ahh, Avalanche, we fiinally meet - " *BANG*
[6:30:23] <xGeneralDOOM> a real man never deny a woman the pleasure of his penis when she wants it Kappa
[6:30:24] <+Neoripo> it's not legal either way
[6:30:35] <Triblade1992> *barrett looking over* "dumb idiot"
[6:30:40] <stratfel112> I like how one mention of yuffie starts a whole debate on age of consent
[6:30:41] <+Jake_Protagonist> I do appreciate a lot of the ideas behind expanded story (not the new elements but the elaborated existing ones), but it spends WAY too much time telling you so little
[6:31:19] <%Samex_Comex> Arise chicken, chicken arise
[6:31:28] <+MisterMusashi> ARISE CHICKEN
[6:31:36] <+MisterMusashi> CHICKEN ARISE
[6:31:37] <sad_toast_> I was 19 and my GF was 23 she said I was "too young" then years later I'm 23 dating a 19 year old like "oooh. I get it now"
[6:31:38] <Triblade1992> I think something that isn't the Changebad ghosts could have established that the plot wasn't going to go in the same direction and allow you to change things
[6:31:45] <+MisterMusashi> PowerUpL lteddyDERP PowerUpR
[6:31:48] <EuropanLamprey> "Need to move over there, better signal"
[6:31:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> @Jake_Protagonist I couldn't have said it better.
[6:32:01] <Triblade1992> I see WHY the change bad ghosts exist, however they should have been something different
[6:32:11] <SonofStranger> imo men should only be allowed to date girls who are taller than them
[6:32:12] <+Jake_Protagonist> I just got to chapter 8 and it’s starting to feel like that one Kotaku hack was right about his feeling that “expanding the midgar section” was more a business decision than an artistic one. The pacing feels neutered thanks to all this padding. A lot of mandatory added battle sequences too.
[6:32:19] <KaiserMario> I don't think we should be debating what's legal here, there are people from different countries watching, and this game is japanese, so dif places, dif laws... Also, morality varies depending on culture, history and circumstance... soo... meh?
[6:32:20] <+ninja_galt> nyan cats that poop rainbows would be better
[6:32:32] <EuropanLamprey> @SonofStranger I'm 6'3" you bastard
[6:32:42] <sad_toast_> plot Ghosts makes the game different or it would be a beat for beat retread
[6:32:49] <SonofStranger> @EuropanLamprey I'm 6'4
[6:33:03] <+Neoripo> This reactor is so blue
[6:33:05] <sad_toast_> I'm 7 foot flat 🤣
[6:33:08] <EuropanLamprey> Oh, so your kamekazeing?
[6:33:10] <+ninja_galt> the world building they added is pretty great tho
[6:33:19] <+Jake_Protagonist> @triblade1992 my friend who didn’t play the original thought the ghosts were the planet literally fighting back. As dumb as that sounded it was such a better idea
[6:33:22] <Triblade1992> @sad_toast_ I like the idea that future games you can branch out and create situations you couldn't beforehand in the originial
[6:33:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:33:25] <arkv01> and then some of them are stamped with a big N
[6:33:34] <ValenAlvernYT> Wow look at this boss walkway
[6:33:37] <+Jake_Protagonist> It’s impossible to define yeah
[6:33:45] <JohnClaggart> sexy cowboy outfit
[6:33:52] <Run44forrest> why is she dressed like that
[6:33:52] <MKUltima> When all yee but no haw.
[6:33:53] <oniwahoo> This is real early for these cutscenes
[6:33:56] <sad_toast_> 🤠🤠🤠
[6:34:01] <ahaegotrigger> I fucking love that Cowgirl outfit
[6:34:03] <Run44forrest> PogChamp VERGIL
[6:34:05] <%Samex_Comex> Cowboy?
[6:34:05] <SonofStranger> that's a big-ass katana
[6:34:06] <EuropanLamprey> "Fuck Sephiroth, Fuck Shinra, and Fuck You!"
[6:34:10] <+Jake_Protagonist> But with all this padding it makes me lean toward this decision to have midgar be its own game be more of a business decision
[6:34:11] <$SomeNEET> Has the NOMURA started happening yet?
[6:34:12] <ahaegotrigger> wow she sure can handle that masamune
[6:34:13] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @plagueofgripes when you finish this do you think this deserves a dragonball Esque long video
[6:34:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> Thirst.....Rising
[6:34:16] <Deviantviking6669> How do her heels not fall through and twist her ankle
[6:34:19] <arkv01> that cowboy outfit firmly cements tifa as a ranch girl
[6:34:38] <sad_toast_> 🤨🤔
[6:34:39] <+Jake_Protagonist> @someneet it starts every time Sephiroth and the ghosts show up
[6:34:46] <+ninja_galt> Tifa doesn't twist an ankle, the catwalk is twisted by her ankle instead
[6:34:59] <%Samex_Comex> Yeehaw lets blow this popsicle stand!
[6:35:04] <oniwahoo> I wonder if Jessie made that one "special"
[6:35:05] <JohnClaggart> but remote controls have a set distance
[6:35:06] <ahaegotrigger> it could go off in my pocket even
[6:35:10] <ahaegotrigger> Kreygasm
[6:35:11] <C__Lab> LUL
[6:35:12] <JohnClaggart> and are blocked by walls
[6:35:17] <Run44forrest> wait is this gonna fall on the city
[6:35:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> The power of cutscenes is boundless.
[6:35:30] <EuropanLamprey> IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE
[6:35:31] <+Jake_Protagonist> Speaking of padding
[6:35:35] <+Jake_Protagonist> Enjoy these hallways
[6:35:37] <oniwahoo> "Where you going?" He says to the inanimate object
[6:35:39] <Run44forrest> daph2head we're being watched whaaaaaaaaaaat
[6:35:40] <thesoothe> What
[6:35:43] <+Daniel_Is_I> METAL GEAR
[6:35:48] <sad_toast_> Tifa ... cloud said there was cameras 🤦
[6:35:48] <Run44forrest> KEKW
[6:36:06] <+Dresdran> That ain't dieselpunk.
[6:36:09] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> Plague they have the ability to turn souls into a petroleum product.
[6:36:09] <xGeneralDOOM> its magic
[6:36:11] <+Jake_Protagonist> You think THATS top advanced? Wait till Sector 5
[6:36:11] <+ninja_galt> they have 1950's cars
[6:36:13] <Triblade1992> President Shinra loved the EMperor's hologram scene from Star wars plague
[6:36:13] <+MisterMusashi> Well that's what they're using IN THE SLUMS zoneSmug
[6:36:15] <EuropanLamprey> You're comparing Shinra to Slums
[6:36:16] <+Jake_Protagonist> too*
[6:36:21] <$SomeNEET> Would it be cool if the robots were constantly spraying mist so it's visible?
[6:36:26] <+MisterMusashi> The SLums only get 20 year old tech
[6:36:29] <ValenAlvernYT> Oh way to advanced, I thought he was gonna start complain how Heidegger is skinny
[6:36:30] <frownystar> He’s rich
[6:36:30] <+MisterMusashi> or something like that
[6:36:38] <xGeneralDOOM> makograms
[6:36:41] <arkv01> oh shit reality tv
[6:36:42] <Justin_k_killed_a_woman> They have gene-splicing technology that is (mostly) good to go.
[6:36:43] <sad_toast_> government hoards the really cool technology like here in the real world 🤷
[6:36:46] <+Neoripo> Shinra cellphones are Iphone 20 tho
[6:36:57] <+Daniel_Is_I> Well Cloud wasn't shown
[6:37:06] <+MisterRockett> WE have holograms, Plauge. Like, our modern tech is fucking up semi-future tech.
[6:37:07] <+Daniel_Is_I> Barret's fucked though
[6:37:09] <+Jake_Protagonist> They don’t really
[6:37:12] <arkv01> I mean to be fair
[6:37:14] <KaiserMario> Hey was that BRuce Lee?
[6:37:18] <arkv01> bombings are kinda an asshole move
[6:37:24] <SonofStranger> wait if there's a bomb threat then why are there people STANDING RIGHT OUTSIDE
[6:37:26] <%JailShmixRemix> current holograms really really aren't that good
[6:37:27] <arkv01> maybe just assassinate shinra?
[6:37:28] <notanegg8> and now they're trying to...blackmail them into...not doing what they want to frame them to do???
[6:37:31] <+UnwoundCaesar70> We gotta stop the Oklahoma city bombings
[6:37:39] <ValenAlvernYT> Why is Bigg Boss talking down to Cloud and Co?
[6:37:44] <sad_toast_> crises actors tisk tisk
[6:37:54] <arkv01> what do you mean 60%?
[6:37:57] <+MisterMusashi> pfffffff
[6:37:57] <arkv01> which bad boy is READY
[6:38:00] <Run44forrest> LUL
[6:38:02] <CyberDingus> I AM ON AIR
[6:38:09] <Triblade1992> Heidegger, you big ape!
[6:38:09] <+MisterMusashi> NARUTO RUNNERS
[6:38:12] <+MisterMusashi> uniiMonka
[6:38:15] <+Dresdran> KILL THEM.
[6:38:17] <%Samex_Comex> WTF are those
[6:38:23] <KaiserMario> "a little bit too much" describes a lot of the issues with this game
[6:38:23] <stratfel112> what is this area 51?
[6:38:24] <vonmaultke> LUL Naruto ninjas
[6:38:25] <sad_toast_> @valenalvernyt cuz he's a mustache twisting villan!!!
[6:38:29] <arkv01> yo being a combatant shock trooper must be RAD
[6:38:30] <sadboy_otoroshi> Hope Barrett teached his child to not watch TV.
[6:38:35] <arkv01> naruto run all day in power suit
[6:38:36] <C__Lab> hobbKEK
[6:38:46] <Huntercd> If they have to bring them alive why are they using lethal force?
[6:38:49] <+Neoripo> Naruto runners after the Area 51 raid
[6:39:25] <+Neoripo> They are delaying them
[6:39:27] <sad_toast_> use Ninjitsu on em or something...
[6:39:29] <hcsarg1986> Are the shock troopers robots?
[6:39:38] <jbrachob> scan them ?
[6:39:48] <%JailShmixRemix> No scans for you
[6:39:53] <jbrachob> ...
[6:39:55] <+Neoripo> no, they are drugged-up humans
[6:40:01] <Deviantviking6669> Wonder how they will handle the suggestive Aerith Red 13 part
[6:40:16] <ValenAlvernYT> iirc Heidegger was large as Wedge and had a cigar, I was really hopping for him to say "got ya now" while blowing holographic smoke at them like a huge dick that he is
[6:40:28] <+SPplayer> you were so easily convinced cloud
[6:40:36] <ahaegotrigger> hell yeah theyre gonna power up there Jo Crystal on live TV
[6:40:36] <sad_toast_> again Wedge's first name is Potatoe
[6:40:37] <hcsarg1986> @Neoripo Why are they so frail?
[6:40:56] <arkv01> this does seem poorly thought out
[6:40:58] <+Neoripo> Because Plague is good at staggering
[6:41:00] <EuropanLamprey> To be fair, they didn't air video of Cloud
[6:41:00] <arkv01> at this point
[6:41:07] <law240> it was in the original tho
[6:41:09] <kuzokai> because this is how they remember it
[6:41:09] <jbrachob> the time ghosts will protect you
[6:41:10] <+MisterRockett> By this point in the story President Shinra DID know who you were.
[6:41:12] <+Daniel_Is_I> Maybe Barret puts on a false mustache
[6:41:12] <Huntercd> It's not the poor people watching
[6:41:14] <Triblade1992> Cloud didn't show up iin the vide plague
[6:41:15] <+Jake_Protagonist> It’s so weird that they’re also like “oh yeah here comes the boss guys you ready”
[6:41:16] <Run44forrest> why dont they wear masks
[6:41:16] <sad_toast_> they know what avalanche is but not spasifuck members? 🤔
[6:41:19] <+MisterRockett> Like, President Shinra is THERE.
[6:41:21] <+Soulbishop> what chapter is this?
[6:41:29] <JohnClaggart> nomura retcons zack as cloud just dying his hair
[6:41:30] <+Neoripo> Yep, Cloud still not shown in the footage
[6:41:39] <arkv01> time to murder innocent grunts :(
[6:41:50] <+Daniel_Is_I> Cloud and Tifa weren't shown, but Barret stands out like a sore thumb
[6:41:59] <+Daniel_Is_I> How many 7-foot ripped black men exist in Midgard?
[6:42:05] <Run44forrest> its not murder they just "passed out"
[6:42:23] <Triblade1992> Yeah the video only showed Barrett, Jesse, Biggs and Wedge. It cut out right before showiing Cloud
[6:42:23] <TeethandHunger> Tifa is 20 in this game, Cloud is 21, Barret 35,
[6:42:38] <CyberDingus> YAY
[6:42:43] <+Neoripo> If they desintegrate into green particles, yeah they ded
[6:42:56] <+Jake_Protagonist> Fira also hits enemies around them
[6:43:21] <Huntercd> It looks stupid
[6:43:35] <arkv01> I don't see why not
[6:43:36] <law240> ???
[6:43:41] <arkv01> all would be easily applicable to just target all tagets
[6:43:48] <+Jake_Protagonist> Don’t mnow
[6:43:52] <HyperBomb21> It's kind of a FF staple to have multi hitting attacks,
[6:43:52] <+Jake_Protagonist> know*
[6:43:54] <sad_toast_> different name for it 🤔
[6:43:58] <law240> Assess is all when you Max it out
[6:44:02] <+Neoripo> dunno
[6:44:04] <+MisterMusashi> There might be an AoE improvement material, or a multi-cazst thing?
[6:44:13] <arkv01> could be like a cone instead of auto-target all enemies
[6:44:14] <sad_toast_> it's like ultima or something...
[6:44:21] <ValenAlvernYT> Depends how the ra and agas work in this game
[6:44:22] <+Daniel_Is_I> There's not an all materia but there''s a materia that boosts AoE
[6:44:23] <+Neoripo> yep
[6:44:23] <+Jake_Protagonist> @law240 really? Weird
[6:44:27] <law240> or targets all
[6:44:32] <+aspirationdeath> doesnt magnify do that?
[6:44:34] <MKUltima> It's like Turkish coffee
[6:44:40] <Triblade1992> Maybe Materia is liike Jello
[6:44:44] <+Daniel_Is_I> Yeah Magnify is the replacement for All
[6:45:12] <sad_toast_> you turn it back into a liquid and vape it 😁
[6:45:13] <+MisterMusashi> Are there other options?
[6:45:14] <KaiserMario> You know... The more I think about it, I'm not 100% on board for the whole "Onee-chan" thing Tifa's got going on...
[6:45:25] <%Samex_Comex> Looks like a mech from armoured core
[6:45:35] <+Daniel_Is_I> You're not wasting anything
[6:45:38] <+MisterMusashi> Make a Save
[6:45:52] <sad_toast_> technically everything looks like a mech from armour core 🤔
[6:45:57] <Huntercd> The only one Tifa is big sister to is Marlene
[6:46:03] <+MisterMusashi> where's the item going?
[6:46:05] <%caramello_man> why would this use up a keycard? how many keycards do they have?
[6:46:09] <+Neoripo> console
[6:46:56] <arkv01> of course, they're creeps who love to watch
[6:46:58] <sadboy_otoroshi> @KaiserMario Why?
[6:46:59] <KaiserMario> @Huntercd It's the "childhood friend"/"big sister" trope she's got, I've seen enough of it to spot it....
[6:47:01] <arkv01> buncha fuckin weirdos
[6:47:06] <MKUltima> Quick Barret start swearing so they have to cut the feed
[6:47:09] <VERDAXY> everyone's watching that ass
[6:47:24] <MKUltima> @VERDAXY Cloud doesn't have an ass though
[6:47:29] <MKUltima> Kappa
[6:47:34] <Triblade1992> "BITCH ASS MOTHERFU-" *camera cuts*
[6:47:35] <VERDAXY> berret does
[6:47:35] <oniwahoo> What does Tifa think "they have cameras everywhere" means?
[6:47:51] <law240> Dose chakra take mp?
[6:47:53] <Sokumotanaka> Well blame the new FF 13 team that now are the head creators of final fantasy games now for making hallway simulators
[6:47:57] <KaiserMario> @sadboy_otoroshi It's one the many anime romantic relationship tropes they always do... Gets old man...
[6:48:12] <arkv01> it's just tifa's PTSD from her brazzers days
[6:48:24] <+Jake_Protagonist> “We’ll allow it”
[6:48:25] <Sol_Install> chew her leg
[6:48:30] <%Samex_Comex> I miss Jessie and Wedge
[6:48:42] <Triblade1992> @Sokumotanaka You say that like FF10 and FF13 linear design is a bad thing. I enjoy that design over bland open world that most rpgs are beinig forced to be
[6:48:43] <+Neoripo> TBH FF7 was also linear, the map just makes it obvious
[6:48:50] <arkv01> I dunno I could really replace wedge with middle manager at this point
[6:48:52] <+muzzle_roar24> Jessie's leg was sacrificed for this slyO7
[6:48:52] <sad_toast_> "big brother" government sub plot cuz modern times or whatever
[6:49:16] <+Neoripo> It's not the linearity, but how you disguise/vary it
[6:49:18] <Huntercd> The childhood friend trope is used in America too
[6:49:21] <ValenAlvernYT> Does the game still "birth" materia?
[6:49:22] <+MisterMusashi> Make a Save
[6:49:32] <+Jake_Protagonist> @neoripo oh for sure. The difference in going from one location to another in this game though is like 2 hours. It’s like they took the line and stretched it
[6:49:45] <sadboy_otoroshi> @KaiserMario The devil is on the details, in this case the lack of them. It can be done, but her relationship with cloud is spread thin with her non-approach approach.
[6:49:56] <arkv01> I appreciate the stretch because midgar was always too short on replays
[6:49:57] <sad_toast_> @mistermusashi I second that been a wile since last SAVE
[6:50:02] <+MisterMusashi> SAVE
[6:50:03] <+Daniel_Is_I> Less magic juice
[6:50:09] <VERDAXY> ai slows down cool downs?
[6:50:12] <+EpicureanIguana> Did i get here in time to watch the Nomura show? With live horror reactions and all
[6:50:15] <VERDAXY> AI*
[6:50:26] <arkv01> no, the nomura show was earlier, but we may get an encore
[6:50:38] <+EpicureanIguana> FeelsBadMan
[6:50:42] <+Neoripo> FF13 was very bad at disguising linear maps and did not have variety like towns and the like. 10 was a little better about it
[6:50:50] <+Jake_Protagonist> @arkv01 I disagree. If midgar was any longer it’d overstay it’s welcome and overshadow the rest of the world you’re trying to save.
[6:51:12] <ValenAlvernYT> Wait they merged Cure and Regen
[6:51:39] <sad_toast_> @valenalvernyt CuRegfn
[6:51:47] <Triblade1992> @Neoripo To be fair, I wasn't tricked by the camera angle stuff from FF10 and knew it was linear. I don't mind them not hiding it because hiding it doesn't work for me
[6:51:55] <sadboy_otoroshi> Regenure
[6:51:58] <+Neoripo> To be honest, due to Midgard being bigger, the longer, more streched hallways are kinda warranted
[6:52:07] <+Jake_Protagonist> Though I wouldn’t mind the stretch either of they things they placed in the stretched line were more interesting. I did enjoy chapter 6’s segment tho
[6:52:08] <Sokumotanaka> @Triblade1992 You're right but I can only walk down one pathway with badly written boring characters and at least ff x had branching paths you can miss. FF13 was a hallway with really dumb annoying enemies they say you can run from but there's not escape function and literally the hallways are too small to avoid sleep inducing battle. What I'm saying is there's such a thing as too restrictive I hate open worlds that are pointless too DA:I anyone?
[6:52:18] <sad_toast_> triggered
[6:52:21] <TalisKanju> Create-Your-Own Boss Battle
[6:52:35] <KaiserMario> @sadboy_otoroshi Thing is, it's done, it has been done, and they still do... It's one of those that you pick up a brand new manga to read, and there it is! You pick up a new anime, and there it is! Even if this one is slightly different than most, it's not so dif that it doesn't bother me
[6:53:18] <Livelinne> Hello Eli
[6:53:22] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[6:53:23] <arkv01> LUL
[6:53:25] <oniwahoo> Just some Quality Assurance guy just going, this isn't supposed to be here, let's fix this
[6:53:26] <ValenAlvernYT> Barret is his own hypeman
[6:53:27] <Triblade1992> @Sokumotanaka greatly diisagree with the character writing. I focus on personality, compelling, facinating and/or believeable. I don't care about likeable, relatable and sympathetic
[6:53:28] <vonmaultke> LUL
[6:53:29] <sad_toast_> he's going full Alex Jones
[6:53:29] <Run44forrest> LUL
[6:53:33] <+EpicureanIguana> I dont really mind the combat in this game, some missions including all the side garbage and Nomura writing were my main issues with it
[6:53:35] <+aspirationdeath> most ff games are linear until you get to the world map. even then its lots of nothing between dungeons and towns youll likely get to anyway following the critical path
[6:53:38] <EuropanLamprey> No Berret, you can't Gol D. Roger yourself
[6:53:39] <arkv01> 1000 gil, you stingy piece of poop clodd
[6:53:44] <TalisKanju> Barret is the butt of the joke AGAIN
[6:53:50] <%Samex_Comex> Greyfox!
[6:54:04] <+MisterMusashi> He's using his CHAKRA FEET
[6:54:05] <arkv01> are you SHITTING ME, they have mag boots
[6:54:15] <+Jake_Protagonist> A lot of the new character dialogue is overall a success at least
[6:54:20] <+Neoripo> Yeah, 13 had 1 corridor nonstop with some short branching paths leading to a chest, 10 had that, but also 2 routes to end in the same place and towns. That kep things more varied
[6:54:21] <arkv01> shinra is packing these guys to the brim with tech
[6:54:28] <Livelinne> woolieSMUG
[6:54:32] <sad_toast_> they shitalk like your not the protagonist of a JRPG 😁
[6:54:35] <+Jake_Protagonist> I’ve REALLY enjoyed Aeirsu’s company so far
[6:54:50] <+Jake_Protagonist> even though she just told me to do more awful side missions
[6:54:57] <+MisterMusashi> Leg drop me, Tifa rooGasm
[6:54:58] <arkv01> LUL was that the grunt's line?
[6:55:24] <EuropanLamprey> Aerith sounds like Paige
[6:55:28] <sad_toast_> LUL
[6:55:29] <Triblade1992> Prayer girl archetype
[6:55:33] <+Neoripo> She does
[6:55:34] <%badbloodbear> What are your thoughts on the game no longer being turn based ?
[6:55:35] <arkv01> yeah I'm pretty worried too, paige can do a 1:1 impression of her and its fucking with the plot in pats playthrough LUL
[6:55:46] <+Jake_Protagonist> Don’t worry she’s not a shrine maiden in either language thank GOD
[6:55:49] <sadboy_otoroshi> @KaiserMario I see. I said that if it was well set and in character is not a trope but a feature. But again, you can see which manga are done for paying the bills and the products of personal expression.
[6:55:52] <+Jake_Protagonist> She’s Genki if anything
[6:55:56] <Sokumotanaka> @Triblade1992 You can have all the above if you write well which the ff13 writers dont know how to and it's widely known but both ff13 and non ff13 fans. But hey to each their own.
[6:56:14] <+Jake_Protagonist> The only one they completely failed it seems is Sephiroth
[6:56:20] <+Jake_Protagonist> Which is expected after KH
[6:56:21] <Triblade1992> Lunafreya was the WORST of that archytype. She was just a checklist of all that crap
[6:56:23] <+aspirationdeath> shes a shrine maiden but also a goofy dork
[6:56:27] <sad_toast_> I loved hearing Paige take the piss out of Aerith
[6:56:44] <+aspirationdeath> hate her voice tho
[6:56:52] <arkv01> it depends on the audience, but sephiroth has succeeded in making the portion of consumers who want him inside them gush
[6:57:02] <Sokumotanaka> I mean if they show sephiroth throw a materia at cloud and A pose over him they'll save it
[6:57:06] <+Jake_Protagonist> Honestly Tifa at least talks more like a shrine maiden in this game so far.
[6:57:19] <Triblade1992> @Sokumotanaka I don't think what you are sayiing is true given how the chracters (especially in Japan) were positively received. Compare that to FF12's cast of mixed to boring reception and you see what I mean
[6:57:28] <+aspirationdeath> @arkv01 theres a lot of homoeroticism in this. kinda into it honestly
[6:57:37] <KaiserMario> @sadboy_otoroshi Normally I wouldn't judge too hard, but the usage of tropes is so prevalent in their media that even if it has some artistic intent, it still gets tired
[6:57:37] <+Neoripo> TBH, real Sephiroth is still not in this game
[6:58:25] <+Jake_Protagonist> Jenova Sephiroth didn’t act like itachi tho. At least from what I remember.
[6:58:34] <sad_toast_> you know what this game needs? more belt buckles and zippers 🤔🤔🤔
[6:58:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> @KaiserMario The negative association runs deep, now i get it.
[6:58:56] <+Jake_Protagonist> @neoripo sadly I’ve heard that’s not true :(
[6:58:58] <MartiusGW> you know what it needs? toriyama waifu
[6:59:00] <KaiserMario> The softly spoken, bishie, sultry anime villain is so common that sometimes it feels like a parody, even when it isn't
[6:59:04] <+Neoripo> :(
[6:59:08] <JohnClaggart> do AI again
[6:59:11] <%JailShmixRemix> Ai again
[6:59:12] <Sol_Install> Ai
[6:59:13] <MKUltima> AI
[6:59:13] <Triblade1992> Ai agaiin
[6:59:14] <PurestKanadaJin> AI
[6:59:20] <ValenAlvernYT> How many keys you still got, you picked up 2 right?
[6:59:21] <+Neoripo> Stun is the worst
[6:59:21] <SonofStranger> sl
[6:59:21] <+Punishedkaiger> One to AI and one to Big Bomber
[6:59:26] <oniwahoo> @martiusgw You get out of here right now LUL
[6:59:29] <+Jake_Protagonist> I got rid of the bomb shells cause fuck the muzzle damage in this game
[6:59:30] <Sokumotanaka> @Triblade1992 I really dont care what you think is true it's not my horse or my race, but I've seen way more reviews in both japan and america that shat it's awful. Idk how you're on a plague stream associated with pat and think ff13 is cool.
[6:59:31] <+MisterMusashi> M-Units sounds like it gives you LOOT kimpleGoldbreb
[6:59:37] <+Jake_Protagonist> missle*
[6:59:41] <EuropanLamprey> OKay, so Krakatoa just erupted, happy 2020
[6:59:57] <Sokumotanaka> How to you get rid of the whole robot?
[7:00:05] <sad_toast_> pantaloons
[7:00:08] <%Rezca> Oh shi- what?
[7:00:12] <arkv01> get in the fuckin robot, cloud
[7:00:19] <kuzokai> you think there might be a bonus if you beat the big bad robot at full power?
[7:00:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> Plague saying something in Spanish that doesn't sound gringo, wow.
[7:00:34] <EuropanLamprey> You're just destroying GLADOS's personality cores at this point
[7:00:44] <Triblade1992> @Sokumotanaka What reviews are you seeing? I have not seen that majority of the time and I do a lot of research into production and development of games.
[7:00:57] <sad_toast_> "get in the robot" 🤔 what's that from I know it's something recent...
[7:01:07] <CitrousCt> So, how goes the game?
[7:01:07] <+Neoripo> Yeah, pretty good spanish pronunciation
[7:01:22] <arkv01> but no murder tho :)
[7:01:31] <C__Lab> Evangelion?
[7:01:39] <arkv01> avalanche only uses 9mm tranqs
[7:01:40] <oniwahoo> How many executions have you been too, Barret?
[7:01:48] <+MisterMusashi> BULLSHIT, CLOUD, YOU DANCE
[7:01:49] <+Neoripo> God dammit!
[7:01:50] <Run44forrest> booooo
[7:01:51] <oniwahoo> Dance, Cloud
[7:01:57] <Huntercd> He's trying to lighten the mood
[7:02:01] <Sokumotanaka> Booo this man
[7:02:05] <thecrazyanbu> Cloud can mash potatoes. And do the twist.
[7:02:06] <hcsarg1986> I wish the Shinra executives had full names
[7:02:08] <sadboy_otoroshi> Wasted Potential right there OH MY GODS!!!
[7:02:10] <AvidLite> Get in the damn dress, Cloud
[7:02:13] <arkv01> tifa weapon?
[7:02:18] <sad_toast_> ladies love Confidence 😁 but it does boarder on stupidity
[7:02:22] <CitrousCt> So, is the remake good or naw?
[7:02:26] <stratfel112> cloud you wet sock at least have smidgen charm
[7:02:43] <CitrousCt> Story-wise, I've kinda come to accept it
[7:02:46] <stratfel112> *a smidgen of charm
[7:02:50] <arkv01> remakes good for most people, there are some who don't jive with it but for mostly... esoteric reasons
[7:02:53] <+Neoripo> Good when it's being a remake
[7:02:57] <ValenAlvernYT> How is there weapons for Barret? "Boy I sure hope a man with a missing arm likes attaching guns..."
[7:03:02] <+MisterMusashi> There are some INSAAAANE unique weapon abilities
[7:03:11] <+MisterMusashi> One of Tif'a future ones is nuts
[7:03:15] <CitrousCt> @ValenAlvernYT Isn't the gun arm a story thing as well?
[7:03:24] <+Jake_Protagonist> The stat differences are not accurate until you upgrade them
[7:03:47] <oniwahoo> 1000000 different weapons, this is the future I want
[7:04:01] <+Neoripo> F no
[7:04:09] <ValenAlvernYT> @CitrousCt Yea, in the original, and its kinda goofy
[7:04:09] <+aspirationdeath> @citrousct it gives you more time with characters that were kinda glossed over in og, music remixes are phenomenal for the most part and combat system is leagues better than 15s
[7:04:14] <sad_toast_> lightning seems very effective
[7:04:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> If all weapons are special, none of them are!
[7:04:39] <sad_toast_> @sadboy_otoroshi real Syndrome hours
[7:05:04] <Triblade1992> the anti crystarium. Ugh
[7:05:08] <ValenAlvernYT> Wait, weapons have sphere grids
[7:05:08] <VERDAXY> wtf is this?
[7:05:12] <+Neoripo> I have 1000 identical weapons in AC Odyssey and i have to periodically spend 20 minutes cleaning up inventory to have space for more shitty weapons
[7:05:15] <oniwahoo> Well this is interesting
[7:05:39] <heroicspiritavenger> That's just a Sphere Grid isn't it?
[7:05:47] <+Neoripo> Fucking Ubisoft -_-
[7:05:49] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Honest question, do you have any suggestions to improve this UI?
[7:05:56] <arkv01> yeeeah lets get that hero reception!
[7:06:00] <arkv01> or they shoot us
[7:06:01] <sadboy_otoroshi> @Neoripo Sounds like the dream.
[7:06:10] <+Neoripo> it's not
[7:06:13] <Triblade1992> @heroicspiritavenger No, it's the anti crystarium. literally taking the crystarium and doing everything WRONG about it
[7:06:19] <oniwahoo> I imagine the people in the Slums just hate Shinra and the upper city people in general
[7:06:21] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario make it a simple menu -.-
[7:06:23] <framewindowcleaner> So Plague, are you enjoying that Midgar is now an unecessary 30 hour section?
[7:06:26] <Sokumotanaka> why would they care tho? They can just walk away
[7:06:49] <+eanscrale> It's pretty hard to pick people out of an actual slum, but it's a little hard not to when they look like a bunch of cosplayers
[7:06:54] <EuropanLamprey> Don't worry, the Time Jannies will stop you from going to far off the rails
[7:07:19] <Huntercd> I mean are poor people watching the broadcast? Also they aren't the ones harmed by Avalanche
[7:07:21] <+Neoripo> you can't even sort them except for level, and level indicates nothing except basic raw strenth
[7:07:30] <sad_toast_> @europanlamprey sir in this chat we refer to them as "Plot Ghosts" 😁😁😁
[7:07:35] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ Sure... but what do you mean "simple", you mean a list? A table of contents? A circle? Just say make it simpler isn't a good answer...
[7:08:12] <arkv01> this is true
[7:08:16] <heroicspiritavenger> Convolution Spooks
[7:08:23] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario well I could be like all the other menus ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[7:08:25] <arkv01> shoot first, talk later
[7:08:37] <oniwahoo> but options that make you harder to kill also have the same effect
[7:08:38] <framewindowcleaner> Remember how the originla materia system was based around managing stat drops more than stat buffs? Man, what an interesting idea, would be a shame if it was ignored.
[7:09:04] <Triblade1992> lol.
[7:09:05] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ but then you run into a different problem of all the menus looking the same...
[7:09:13] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario they took a look at the Skyrim level up system like "OOOH let's do that!!"
[7:09:16] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I hope someone makes a mod to make tifa's tits bigger.
[7:09:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> That would be nice
[7:09:21] <arkv01> I can't wait to force my grand nephews to consume this on their VR chat PS4 emulators
[7:09:34] <sadboy_otoroshi> Presentation wasn't all after all.
[7:09:37] <Sokumotanaka> IT's fine
[7:09:38] <@dcn2049> haha
[7:09:50] <Explodincatz> Ted Talk in WWE form
[7:09:51] <KaiserMario> You know... This actually look like a Mass Effect 2 galaxy map
[7:10:00] <+aspirationdeath> what a bizarre and convoluted analogy plague
[7:10:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> An i like it that way
[7:10:26] <Triblade1992> I hate this because it looks like a terrible version of the crystarium. from backdrop to how the crystals are used to the disconnected natture.
[7:10:30] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario but yo I do agree it would be another boring menu this does "spice" it up just a little .. but you just said it's a mess and I'm typing this 😂🤪
[7:10:31] <%caramello_man> the colours on this menu make no sense, it's just like a blast of different shit and then black cos "space'
[7:11:15] <hntronium> Where's Plague at?
[7:11:19] <CrowbarFacelift> LUL
[7:11:26] <Crunkle_Dunkle> this game looks garbage
[7:11:26] <hntronium> Oh, Road to Reactor 5
[7:11:50] <EuropanLamprey> entire episodes of a still screen while they talk about Jedi philosophy
[7:11:55] <framewindowcleaner> Oh look, it's the padded out "make the boss last less time" dungeon.
[7:12:00] <sad_toast_> "hey we got a few Gs of spare memory power or whatever what do we spend it on?" oh I know a neat looking nonsense upgrade menu!!
[7:12:03] <+aspirationdeath> @crunkle_dunkle nice contribution :)
[7:12:06] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ I don't dislike this, but I don't think it's good either... I was just curious if there was a way to do the same theme in a less... obnoxious way
[7:12:09] <%ragerunner2020> Damn I fell asleep and you're still streaming must be enjoying the game yeah?
[7:12:09] <CrowbarFacelift> I can't really think of many other games where I don't mind 90 straight minutes of dialogue, though. KotOR II is great.
[7:12:38] <Sokumotanaka> To be fair it's gotten better and its' mostly V's fault of sitting there and explaining it to him rather than letting him do it
[7:12:43] <CitrousCt> So, we are killing people right? Not just knocking them out?
[7:12:47] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario just a dumb old talent tree ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
[7:12:51] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[7:12:51] <+SPplayer> did you end up going through re3? I remember you asking about it on twitter
[7:12:52] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ Also, they've been doing these weird upgrade screens since FF X
[7:13:16] <Sokumotanaka> @CitrousCt Oh we're still knowing them out....of the gene pool
[7:13:28] <arkv01> he's gone full mr. t
[7:13:34] <+aspirationdeath> @citrousct canonically dont think they kill anyone, but we know the truth
[7:13:36] <sad_toast_> @kaisermario I've barely touched any FF game so I have no idea 😅
[7:13:37] <Triblade1992> All he needs to do is start swearing every 5 seconds
[7:13:39] <arkv01> he was only at 25% prior to this
[7:13:50] <ValenAlvernYT> When you like new Barret but also miss Barret who chews out Cloud every step of the way
[7:13:56] <CitrousCt> I mean, the bodies turn into lifestream tho
[7:13:57] <+valiard> Does all materia exist?
[7:14:01] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ Oh man, some of these get really upsetting LUL
[7:14:05] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes goodnight dafranB
[7:14:06] <+aspirationdeath> @citrousct shhhh
[7:14:13] <sad_toast_> Barrett knows he's got an audience now so he CRANKS IT UP TO 11!!!
[7:14:45] <heroicspiritavenger> At the end of the day, what's really the difference between Pat and Paige anyway
[7:14:46] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes You ever thought of streaming Kotor
[7:14:52] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yeah I love that
[7:14:57] <arkv01> that sounds RAD though
[7:14:57] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[7:15:00] <arkv01> but bad for his LP tax
[7:15:05] <KaiserMario> That's a plus in my book
[7:15:07] <gnollAUS> That means your having a good conversation
[7:15:12] <stratfel112> So when you leave this section is everyone not going to mess with you because you guys are bad-asses ?
[7:15:17] <EuropanLamprey> 40 minutes of why the Jedi order is full of a bunch of bitches while Fann Y'Pakk stares at a wall
[7:15:35] <GenericTwitchAcc1> more podcasts for the podcast god
[7:15:41] <oniwahoo> @heroicspiritavenger One has zero constitution the other should have zero constitution
[7:15:41] <KaiserMario> CHEAT
[7:15:44] <%caramello_man> cheat away bro
[7:15:46] <sad_toast_> warning in the video discripcion "we take breaks to pod cast while playing"
[7:15:51] <arkv01> sure, whats wrong with cheating on a 15 year old game?
[7:15:58] <CursedNobleman> kotor 2 combat s boring anyhow
[7:16:02] <SuperVaderMan> Unfortunately, level-up cheats just makes the enemies level up with you
[7:16:06] <SuperVaderMan> in kotor 2
[7:16:07] <arkv01> yeah sometimes V does become a gamefaqs guide
[7:16:18] <Murphio_GS> I do like the dialogue stuff though
[7:16:20] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I love very talkly lets plays especally like for a game like KOTOR where the actual gameplay loop is the least intresting part of it.
[7:16:21] <CrowbarFacelift> There's unfortunately a lot of interesting stuff to miss based on skill checks
[7:16:26] <ValenAlvernYT> Movement Units?
[7:16:28] <CyberDingus> M issiles?
[7:16:32] <GeltonZ> Materia Units?
[7:16:33] <Triblade1992> looks like missles
[7:16:37] <sad_toast_> awww kotor... when BioWare gave a crap
[7:16:42] <+ButtMcChuggles> M Units gave Ethers on my go at it
[7:16:46] <Sokumotanaka> I would have enjoyed you going through KOTOR 2 or maybe jade empire
[7:16:46] <oniwahoo> Didn't Barret tell you to hurry up last time, but now he's saying take your time?
[7:17:01] <+Neoripo> m units give you items
[7:17:06] <Sokumotanaka> HK should be in FF7 remake
[7:17:11] <+Neoripo> ethers i think
[7:17:17] <sad_toast_> boxxes full of missiles 🤷
[7:17:23] <Sokumotanaka> Statement: Time to die Sephiroth
[7:17:28] <KaiserMario> What was really stupid, is that they work to get Force Lighting so they can crush enemies and then LittleV says: "Maybe we should change your lightsaber to hands, because the game is too easy now..." Like, wtf? Why did you build a broken char then???
[7:18:01] <sad_toast_> HK should be in every game at that point 😁
[7:18:10] <+aspirationdeath> maan im kinda looking forward to the prospect of vincent maybe being an actual character this time around
[7:18:11] <TheWe4pon> to be fair woolie was gunning for a punch jedi for awhile
[7:18:20] <Sokumotanaka> Statement: Your hairgel is cheap and flammable!
[7:18:26] <ValenAlvernYT> Get rid of AI and it just sits there
[7:18:36] <EuropanLamprey> Woolie wanted to be a punch boy and force lightning means he won't gimp himself too much doing so now
[7:18:51] <framewindowcleaner> Vincent will get his Dirge of Cerberus bullshit
[7:18:57] <arkv01> we're going to find vincent in the forest and yuffie in the coffin LUL
[7:18:58] <%caramello_man> @TheWe4pon woolie is always looking for "punch-thing"
[7:19:01] <Triblade1992> Wutai has been tied in with this remake too
[7:19:04] <Sokumotanaka> Didn't he used to be a turk?
[7:19:04] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath Dude! Vincent is what scares me the most... Boy that Dierge of Cerberus... ooooohh boy...
[7:19:04] <+EpicureanIguana> oh god no dirge of cerberus
[7:19:20] <Triblade1992> they are mentioning A LOT about Wutai this time around
[7:19:24] <sad_toast_> I remember Pockets 😔
[7:19:26] <framewindowcleaner> There's Dirge of Cerberus references in this game, soooo...
[7:19:31] <+aspirationdeath> @kaisermario they have to know everyone hates that shit though
[7:19:41] <oniwahoo> Dirge of Cerberus should get remade before they continue this game Kappa
[7:19:52] <$jamarartdoodles> Yeah didn't he use to be a turk
[7:19:53] <CursedNobleman> @oniwahoo i concur
[7:20:03] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath I'm sure they knew how people felt about Advent Children too, and yet here we are...
[7:20:16] <Sokumotanaka> I just hope they actually you know NAME nanaki (red 13) Race this time
[7:20:22] <+EpicureanIguana> well... tbh it doesnt get much worse than time police and edge of creation shenanigans, Dirge of cerberus is tame in comparison
[7:20:30] <sad_toast_> Derge of Cerberus had a great idea just poor execution
[7:20:39] <CursedNobleman> hmm, shinra tats are a thing LUL
[7:20:43] <SleepyMaribo> imagine buying a shinra t shirt as a souvenir only to get gunned down by a big angry man with a gun arm.
[7:20:45] <framewindowcleaner> Can't wait to fight Internet Hojo
[7:21:00] <Triblade1992> Omega wasn't the problem. The bad guys attached to it were the major problem
[7:21:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> For those who remember ¿Eli used to be a novel writer o r a screenplay writer?
[7:21:22] <DoppyDanny> so has plague been enjoying game?
[7:21:25] <hntronium> Eli did try writing a novel
[7:21:33] <+UnwoundCaesar70> LOL
[7:21:35] <GeltonZ> XD Plague nailed it.
[7:21:39] <Gavaline> Plague
[7:21:39] <Sokumotanaka> No no dirge of cerberus GAKT may want to come back and ruin ff7
[7:21:40] <KaiserMario> Hey guys... How excited are you for that shoehorned Lightning optional boss fight? LUL
[7:21:42] <sad_toast_> that's fair understand
[7:21:42] <GenericTwitchAcc1> with no paroles
[7:21:50] <%JailShmixRemix> Dirge of Cerberus is not worth playing under any circumstance
[7:21:52] <Gavaline> You're veering dangerously close to defending Dirge
[7:21:54] <%caramello_man> shit diarrhea doodoo
[7:21:57] <sad_toast_> they tried *
[7:22:11] <KaiserMario> @aspirationdeath This game is way better than anything FF7 since the original
[7:22:13] <framewindowcleaner> Oh, you mean like Sephiroth appearing since Chapter 2?
[7:22:14] <Triblade1992> Omega at least made sense as a last resort weapon. the bad guys were the thing that made it diarhea doo doo.
[7:22:19] <hntronium> @sadboy_otoroshi He talks about it in WWFIO Reklaw
[7:22:20] <GeltonZ> @KaiserMario I am disappointed there's no way you can just make cross dressing Cloud dress as Lightning.
[7:22:29] <KaiserMario> LUL
[7:22:42] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[7:22:44] <oniwahoo> Wow
[7:22:47] <sad_toast_> LUL
[7:22:51] <Sol_Install> It was the PLOT GHOST
[7:22:52] <ValenAlvernYT> Someone had to send it up for whatever reason
[7:22:53] <Triblade1992> LUL
[7:22:57] <VERDAXY> HE TANKS THE DAMAGE Salutes
[7:23:01] <Sokumotanaka> @KaiserMario Lightning? Say sike right now!
[7:23:02] <+Neoripo> Plot armor
[7:23:08] <$jamarartdoodles> lol
[7:23:09] <GenericTwitchAcc1> good ole Dark Souls interaction invincibility
[7:23:12] <framewindowcleaner> The ghosts did it
[7:23:15] <CitrousCt> Squall meanwhile is sitting in a corner
[7:23:16] <KaiserMario> @GeltonZ I'll be waiting for the PC mod
[7:23:16] <hntronium> Lightning? This isn't 3rd Birthday
[7:23:34] <+EpicureanIguana> PC mod that fixes the ending Kreygasm
[7:23:36] <KaiserMario> @Sokumotanaka I'm joking of course... ... OR AM I?????
[7:23:51] <Sokumotanaka> *screams*
[7:23:58] <oniwahoo> I love this Barret
[7:24:03] <hntronium> Oh Barret, such a dork
[7:24:09] <CyberDingus> Veto :C
[7:24:13] <hntronium> I bet he does
[7:24:14] <KaiserMario> LUL
[7:24:21] <GeltonZ> Friendly reminder that the guy behind FF13 straight up tried to say Lightning is the Final Fantasy equivalent of Arslan from Lion Witch and the Wardrobe/Narnia.
[7:24:23] <+lordericter> he wants to make sure the Ginyu force pose is on point
[7:24:23] <Triblade1992> Please have hiim do that
[7:24:26] <CursedNobleman> yessss
[7:24:28] <EuropanLamprey> Berret's as much of a dork as Cloud, he's just more open about it
[7:24:29] <sad_toast_> @hntronium agreed! but he's our dork 😁
[7:24:33] <+muzzle_roar24> rooDab
[7:24:42] <CursedNobleman> psaDab psaDab
[7:24:50] <oniwahoo> Cloud play along for fucks sake, I want to see where this goes
[7:25:00] <+EpicureanIguana> lightning is a failed cloud clone is what she is
[7:25:14] <GeltonZ> @EpicureanIguana Yup
[7:25:18] <sadboy_otoroshi> @hntronium Thank you, i think Eli that critiques things like a writer of a specific like genre o medium (i don't know about).
[7:25:22] <CitrousCt> Man, when will Final Fantasy villains realize that big mechanical monstrosities don't work against teenagers?
[7:25:23] <hntronium> Just use Lightning magic I guess plague
[7:25:45] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I need Tifa to call someone a bitch
[7:25:50] <arkv01> dirtier tifa, I need DIRTIER
[7:25:55] <sad_toast_> i do love these robot designs 👌👍
[7:26:12] <GenericTwitchAcc1> very Mean Girls-esque
[7:26:24] <sad_toast_> it's like if a tractor came to life and started killing
[7:26:29] <hntronium> Tiffers is a sweetie pie, she wouldn't call someone a bitch. If you want that, go to Aerith
[7:26:30] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I just want Tifa to all of a sudden get really nasty. Just come after someone's whole life out of nowhere.
[7:26:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> Mining claws are underused in mecha designs.
[7:26:48] <sad_toast_> Sexcellent 👌
[7:27:21] <oniwahoo> Maximum Overdrive: a Shinra production
[7:27:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Well all know Aerith HAS to call someone a bitch by the end of the game.
[7:27:27] <KaiserMario> The real FF7 remake was Egoraptor's "Awesome FF7" flash bit
[7:27:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It has to happen or this whole game is a failure.
[7:27:39] <+EpicureanIguana> hadnt noticed the weird christmas light decor on the stair railings
[7:27:50] <arkv01> big chub
[7:27:56] <hntronium> Can you change materia and equips mid-fight?
[7:27:57] <sad_toast_> lightning build 👌
[7:28:19] <framewindowcleaner> I mean... they basically lose
[7:28:22] <sad_toast_> hyping it up man
[7:28:24] <GenericTwitchAcc1> as do we all
[7:28:31] <arkv01> except you, middle manager
[7:28:38] <oniwahoo> Except Biggs and Wedge and Jessie, they won't make it home
[7:28:49] <framewindowcleaner> LUL Was thinking the same exact thing
[7:28:49] <$Rivalshotzgp> Plot ghosts will ruin the day
[7:28:52] <%caramello_man> @hntronium nah
[7:28:52] <Triblade1992> Barrett is turning around
[7:28:55] <%Samex_Comex> Nooo not wedge!
[7:29:00] <thecrazyanbu> Cloud's allowed one good line
[7:29:06] <sad_toast_> "but I'm still about duh moooneys" 💰💸💵
[7:29:11] <sadboy_otoroshi> They have total control of the facility and they don't turn the elevators.
[7:29:12] <hntronium> Try to progress
[7:29:15] <arkv01> cloud doesn't even need to pay rent, whys he fixated with money?
[7:29:24] <KaiserMario> I think it's adorable that Barret wears sunglasses during missions to conceal his identity
[7:29:25] <impartialcredit> sealed for flavor
[7:29:40] <framewindowcleaner> Well... ghosts do appear
[7:29:41] <Triblade1992> Dont worry, they won't do that
[7:29:42] <@dcn2049> A plot ghost appears and just pulls out a gun
[7:29:47] <CitrousCt> @KaiserMario Because no one is gonna notice the 7ft muscle man with an arm gun
[7:29:53] <sad_toast_> plot ghost pushes Cloud off a cliff
[7:29:57] <GeltonZ> FAULTY COMPONENTS?!?!?!?! FUCK YEEEAH!!!
[7:29:59] <KaiserMario> @CitrousCt Precisely
[7:30:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> @arkv01 To be a petty bitch for no reason other than E D G E.
[7:30:12] <sad_toast_> BONK TIME!
[7:30:19] <arkv01> this is one of those dumb 90s tropes that looks dumb as hell now LUL
[7:30:37] <framewindowcleaner> WHY KEEP THIS
[7:30:40] <hntronium> I appreciate that they kept it
[7:30:57] <sad_toast_> @framewindowcleaner nostalgia 👌
[7:31:16] <Triblade1992> oh thank god it doesn't mess it up
[7:31:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> Tiny girl with big controls, why am i aroused.
[7:31:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Because you know what's good in life
[7:31:34] <%JailShmixRemix> because you're horny
[7:31:41] <KaiserMario> Well, I'm sure some military grade security measures have simultaneous key switching, look silly af tho...
[7:31:41] <oniwahoo> I wonder if they make you fail the first time
[7:31:44] <sad_toast_> @sadboy_otoroshi boi I feel yuh
[7:31:53] <arkv01> without barret's stellar VA this would be a dry af sequence
[7:32:01] <%JailShmixRemix> Horniness begone atamSpray atamStare
[7:32:02] <hntronium> What's problematic?
[7:32:19] <EuropanLamprey> Black man loves murder, robbing, and his chicken summon
[7:32:32] <GeltonZ> One up one down
[7:32:35] <framewindowcleaner> If Shinra weren't cartoony levels of evil, Avalanche would be pure evil guys
[7:32:37] <arkv01> shake it off PogChamp shake it off
[7:32:38] <VERDAXY> god dammit
[7:32:52] <sad_toast_> @jailshmixremix you did it .. hornyness is no more
[7:32:54] <CitrousCt> Avalanche is what GreenPeace wishes they were
[7:32:58] <%JailShmixRemix> Finally
[7:33:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> rising....
[7:33:06] <oniwahoo> They definitely could have been more clear about that
[7:33:07] <sad_toast_> 😂
[7:33:10] <sadboy_otoroshi> again--
[7:33:17] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[7:33:29] <hntronium> It's super clear though
[7:33:32] <KaiserMario> Super in-depth, genre defining, gameplay right here boys! Making the legacy of FF7 proud!
[7:33:44] <EuropanLamprey> Avalanche is a terrorist group lead by a murderous theologically insane man who just happens to be %100 right
[7:34:00] <hntronium> OH
[7:34:13] <hntronium> These lose conditions are great
[7:34:14] <%JailShmixRemix> That's a good voiceline
[7:34:16] <SuperVaderMan> do you do it on the green flash?
[7:34:16] <sad_toast_> 😏
[7:34:17] <oniwahoo> I love Barret
[7:34:20] <Triblade1992> oh no
[7:34:23] <sadboy_otoroshi> joystick minigame?
[7:34:24] <arkv01> barret is a legend now
[7:34:29] <+professormorrigan> psaSmug
[7:34:38] <arkv01> og barret was just "the black guy" and now he's the main man
[7:34:38] <thecrazyanbu> Barret did it for the vine
[7:34:47] <hcsarg1986> Hardest boss fight in the whole game
[7:34:56] <+SPplayer> it looks like its flashing orange when its time, that or its when you are doing it
[7:34:57] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[7:34:59] <+EpicureanIguana> Tifa was the problem all along NotLikeThis
[7:35:00] <sad_toast_> what if every failed attempt robots swarmed the room 🤔
[7:35:10] <Explodincatz> "faithful"
[7:35:16] <framewindowcleaner> In the OG game, this took 1 minute
[7:35:22] <CitrousCt> Aren't people watching us?
[7:35:23] <KaiserMario> This is the true Dark Souls
[7:35:23] <thecrazyanbu> Keep in mind this is being streamed live
[7:35:24] <hntronium> Oh, Barret's great
[7:35:26] <oniwahoo> Aaaa Vaaa Lanche!
[7:35:48] <+schlager087> you done did it!
[7:35:54] <sad_toast_> 😳😳😳
[7:35:55] <hntronium> This is how Shinra will defeat Avalanche
[7:35:56] <sadboy_otoroshi> It should have locked up by so many failed attempts already.
[7:36:00] <Explodincatz> the people start to feel sorry for the terrorists
[7:36:02] <Triblade1992> Just like the TRUE FF7 experience Plague
[7:36:04] <hntronium> With timing puzzles
[7:36:04] <GenericTwitchAcc1> SOUJABOIIII
[7:36:14] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud can't dance
[7:36:36] <+SPplayer> its like the peg game from prequel, where it had like 6 different dialogues
[7:36:37] <hntronium> Magic Up
[7:36:39] <sad_toast_> cloud ain't got rythum 😏
[7:37:10] <+Neoripo> push button
[7:38:13] <Triblade1992> yes
[7:38:15] <+schlager087> is this a blind playthrough?
[7:38:17] <sad_toast_> just stuff ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[7:38:19] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[7:38:23] <hntronium> Kind of
[7:38:25] <framewindowcleaner> Stuff to sell
[7:38:26] <VERDAXY> LOOT?
[7:38:39] <hntronium> I think Plague's seen a few bits and pieces from Pat's stream
[7:38:40] <+schlager087> but what about them leaks?
[7:38:43] <KaiserMario> When so much of this game can be solved with proper timing and exploiting enemies weakness, stats become way less important than in the original...
[7:38:54] <+schlager087> ah ok, just wondering if any leaks were read or not
[7:39:49] <framewindowcleaner> The OG game's arrangements were purposeful, with weird synths and percussion. This OST is just a mish mash
[7:39:58] <MartiusGW> oh, another thing pulled out form 13
[7:40:08] <SupportWriter> 👻
[7:40:09] <CitrousCt> Hey
[7:40:13] <CitrousCt> It's that trailer scene
[7:40:22] <KaiserMario> But Plague, is this any better than Ergheiz?
[7:40:35] <sad_toast_> let's get ready to RUUUMMMBBBLLLLLEE!!!
[7:40:44] <Triblade1992> at least the hologram gets rid of thte plot hole as to why barrett didn't just shoot President Shinra
[7:40:52] <arkv01> it was always kinda dumb in the og for the pres to show up in preson
[7:40:53] <arkv01> easy shot
[7:40:54] <CrowbarFacelift> is that Skull Face?
[7:40:57] <+aspirationdeath> @framewindowcleaner the stuff that makes it into gameplay is all stellar. the jukebox stuff is hit or miss
[7:41:00] <framewindowcleaner> HOW DOES NOT ONE IN SHINRA POINT OUT THIS GUY WAS NEVER A SOLDIER FIRST CLASS ?
[7:41:16] <CrowbarFacelift> oh that's definitely Skull Face
[7:41:18] <TalisKanju> Hey, he uses the weapon you equip in cutscenes
[7:41:42] <framewindowcleaner> @aspirationdeath I kinda disagree, I dislike the orchestral arrangements of some pieces, but I'm also a nitpicking asshole
[7:41:49] <sadboy_otoroshi> It's nice to see that customization carries on the cutscenes.
[7:41:53] <hntronium> @framewindowcleaner He hasn't said First Class to anyone in Shinra yet. Just Ex-Solider
[7:42:06] <hntronium> *Soldier
[7:42:08] <sad_toast_> y'all can't use all the oil! we're I mean the MAKA!!!
[7:42:20] <KaiserMario> Everyone one of these villain speeches sound like that ProZD skit... "This world is imperfect..."
[7:42:25] <framewindowcleaner> @hntronium He said it to Barret and Roche
[7:42:42] <hntronium> Yeah, Barret and some 3rd class punk
[7:42:46] <+MisterRockett> I mean, you can VISUALLY see that Mako Reactors kill all surrounding environments they're placed on. It's idiotic that people WOULDN'T put 2 and 2 together.
[7:42:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> Finally, big brain move.
[7:42:53] <+EpicureanIguana> Nomura FeelsWeirdMan
[7:42:58] <+MisterRockett> And if people DON'T know then how does BARRET know?
[7:42:58] <Sokumotanaka> I hope this still isn't live
[7:42:58] <stratfel112> this hologram stuff was tired when it first showed up this is tedious
[7:43:00] <GenericTwitchAcc1> ?????
[7:43:07] <oniwahoo> What's the point of telling them your plans here?
[7:43:15] <Huntercd> How does an Electric company have enemies? Did Wutai try to sell solar panels?
[7:43:23] <+MisterRockett> They want the footage of them being killed by the air buster and the timer would make the panick.
[7:43:31] <Gavaline> ALL I'M SAYING IS, GIVE WAR A CHANCE
[7:43:34] <%Rezca> Wutai needs another war
[7:43:35] <Triblade1992> Wutai needs to be tied better
[7:43:36] <+lordericter> Wutai is for the kids
[7:43:45] <Sokumotanaka> I'm guessing Yuffile is a freedom fighter in the remake
[7:43:49] <+valiard> But the drama plague Kappa
[7:43:50] <framewindowcleaner> Why does Shinra destroy its own property just to frame Avalanche?
[7:43:52] <+MisterRockett> Well Yuffie has gone from optional to mandatory so Wutai is more important now.
[7:43:54] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Call him a bitch Tifa! Do it!
[7:43:59] <sadboy_otoroshi> Oh sicko mode Tifa!!!!
[7:44:00] <%JailShmixRemix> Too many
[7:44:10] <arkv01> FIGHT BACK
[7:44:19] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Isn't she tired of being nice? Doesn't she wanna go apeshit?
[7:44:20] <EuropanLamprey> ARISE CHIKEN ARISE
[7:44:25] <CitrousCt> That hologram in the background looks so goofy
[7:44:44] <KaiserMario> @Huntercd Thing is, it's not just electric company, they are also a oil company, a food company, and so on... They control most, if not all, mako energy resources
[7:44:45] <Sokumotanaka> How did Tifa destroy that robot in an instant and still lost her death battle to that stupid blonde?
[7:45:01] <GeltonZ> @Sokumotanaka Which stupid blonde?
[7:45:05] <C__Lab> Scan?
[7:45:05] <CitrousCt> Robots are like cannon fodder to FF protags
[7:45:16] <hntronium> @GeltonZ That rwby girl
[7:45:18] <CitrousCt> It's not really impressive anymore to beat robots with your robots
[7:45:21] <CitrousCt> Fists*
[7:45:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> A Robot that can fart, brilliant, weaponized flatulences.
[7:45:22] <GeltonZ> @hntronium AH
[7:45:44] <sadboy_otoroshi> ... to introduce my self
[7:45:49] <Sokumotanaka> @GeltonZ Look up deathbattle on youtube tifa vs and watch it's bad and I dont even like ff7
[7:46:02] <hntronium> @Sokumotanaka Because of popularity bias. RWBY was still pretty popular at the time of the match iirc. Same way Toph can somehow snap Gaara's neck
[7:46:48] <GenericTwitchAcc1> LUL
[7:47:01] <sad_toast_> 😳😬
[7:47:09] <CitrousCt> I wonder if there's any reward for fighting this thing without handicaps
[7:47:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> Thank you daddy!!! I wasn't the only one whoe heard her say that right.
[7:47:30] <Huntercd> That robot looks so dumb
[7:47:45] <KaiserMario> deathbattle is VERY misguided in almost everything they do... very bad
[7:47:47] <Sokumotanaka> @hntronium Okay with Toph there's a feasible reason she can beat Gaara but the other one is a series that's been out at that time for like one year and Tifa fight against god like beings but still lost to an angry one dimensional teen? pfffy
[7:48:06] <Sokumotanaka> Death battle is weird
[7:48:22] <hntronium> Not with how she actually did it. With a neck snap against the very superhuman ninja?
[7:48:23] <CitrousCt> I mean, okay
[7:48:35] <heroicspiritavenger> You have to remember that Death Battle isn't unbiased
[7:48:43] <WMGreywind> Well can't go against your employers, yeah?
[7:48:47] <Sokumotanaka> @hntronium The animation is just for fun
[7:48:49] <CursedNobleman> POSE
[7:48:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> Chickem Nuggies
[7:48:54] <+MisterRockett> GUARD
[7:48:55] <KaiserMario> Stan Lee solved death battle years ago when he said "the one who wins, is the one the writer WANTS to win"
[7:48:57] <Tikigod784> Death Battle goes on the creator's favorite shows lol
[7:49:14] <Flamethrowerman09> Death Battle frustrates me to no end
[7:49:14] <hntronium> @KaiserMario That's such a cop-out
[7:49:19] <Sokumotanaka> @hntronium not accurate but yeah death battle is bias
[7:49:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> @KaiserMario Amen to that.
[7:49:22] <Tikigod784> @KaiserMario and the deathbattle writers are bad
[7:49:26] <WMGreywind> Don't forget about Master Chief and Doomguy.
[7:49:27] <CitrousCt> I never get why people get up and about these fantasy matchups
[7:49:36] <Sokumotanaka> All out attack!
[7:49:37] <hntronium> Because someone is wrong
[7:49:43] <KaiserMario> @hntronium but it's true, and that's why their videos often don't make any sense
[7:50:05] <Huntercd> It silly like a knight vs a samurai
[7:50:09] <Tikigod784> It always triggers fans when a youtube channel tries to do shit from a supposed position of authority
[7:50:13] <+aspirationdeath> because those that get caught up in fandoms are stupid dum dums
[7:50:17] <Frankomancer> if you are watching death battle for any reasons besides the animation i feel sorry for you. That seems frustrating
[7:50:20] <TalisKanju> Airbuster turned into Carry Armor for a minute there!
[7:50:24] <sadboy_otoroshi> @CitrousCt They want their own personal fantasy to win and not the actual established character.
[7:50:25] <Sokumotanaka> @WMGreywind Wait they did master chief vs doomguy and I missed it!?
[7:50:25] <CitrousCt> Most of these matchups pit individuals with ridiculous feats that usually operate under their own rulesets to begin with
[7:50:26] <Flamethrowerman09> Wonder Woman vs Thor is one of the worst in recent memory.
[7:50:34] <WMGreywind> That was a while ago. Back when they used 2d animations.
[7:50:38] <KaiserMario> Like how a god Goku, whose punches can shake galaxies will still lose to Superman no matter what... like... sure man, whatever you say
[7:50:44] <WMGreywind> Before we got Doom 2016.
[7:50:45] <hntronium> Oh, I agree that DeathBattle is full of bias and their videos don't make sense. But I'll maintain that 'whoever the author wants to win will win' is a copout
[7:50:54] <Tikigod784> but just because you post it in video format doesn't make it better than any ol' forum post. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[7:51:02] <hntronium> Because that shit is mega-stupid when taken into context with Marvel comics
[7:51:17] <CitrousCt> Right. But surely one can see that these matchups are dumb to begin with
[7:51:29] <Sokumotanaka> ^
[7:51:34] <hntronium> It's just a way to sidestep the fact that its continuity is shit and none of the writers try to keep things consistent
[7:51:37] <+aspirationdeath> neeeeeeerds
[7:51:39] <Huntercd> One would think
[7:51:50] <WMGreywind> The only difference between school kids talking about who would win and death battle is one has money somehow being thrown behind it.
[7:51:52] <+SPplayer> wow, it even labeled it as a tank buster
[7:51:54] <CitrousCt> Marvel is a real bad example, cause dudes like the Punisher have slaughtered their way through super powered freaks
[7:52:07] <Tikigod784> @aspirationdeath we run on internet salt
[7:52:14] <sadboy_otoroshi> @CitrousCt try telling that god doesn't exist to a christian and you get the gist of it.
[7:52:19] <hntronium> Its a relevant example because Stan Lee was the person who said that.
[7:52:30] <%JailShmixRemix> Thanks tifa
[7:52:30] <hntronium> And how that line is fucking stupid at times
[7:52:33] <CitrousCt> Oh from Stan Lee, yeah makes sense
[7:52:37] <Sokumotanaka> awww I missed it!
[7:52:38] <GeltonZ> @WMGreywind And Death Battle has money being thrown at it FOR THIS EXACT REASON! People eat that shit up! I don't watch it but I cannot escape hearing about it!
[7:52:39] <Triblade1992> Tifa is a good girl
[7:52:43] <KaiserMario> @hntronium You can't accurately make an analisys of fictional characters like that because the writing is inconsistent. Every author changes the rules, and bend logic to make the story work. If a writer decides Batman can beat Superman, he will, unfortunately that's how it works...
[7:53:01] <MartiusGW> who is stronger, goku or superman?
[7:53:05] <CitrousCt> @sadboy_otoroshi Can't say that's a good analogy honestly.
[7:53:22] <Sokumotanaka> @MartiusGW Let's not start that flame war!
[7:53:24] <Explodincatz> u wish
[7:53:28] <Frankomancer> @martiusgw thats up to the writer of the battle to decide
[7:53:41] <WMGreywind> Similar to Deadliest Warrior.
[7:53:54] <Flamethrowerman09> Most of their matchups make no sense. Most of their matchups are just 2 characters that a vaguely similar character trait to the other.
[7:54:07] <CitrousCt> Deadliest Warrior is weird in that there could be a good argument to be made since there is real life precedence to the candidates
[7:54:09] <Tikigod784> Who is stronger, Plague or Plague's Spiteful derision of the time ghosts?
[7:54:19] <WMGreywind> Yeah but remember, Ninja vs Spartan.
[7:54:26] <Flamethrowerman09> Also they have one of the worst depictions of Deadpool i've ever seen
[7:54:29] <hntronium> @KaiserMario I can't make an accurate analysis, but I can try to keep things a bit consistent compared to say, Punisher doing stupid shit like surviving against all those superpowered heroes somehow.
[7:54:29] <WMGreywind> And then Zombies vs Vampires as the last episode.
[7:54:54] <Gavaline> @Tikigod784 Depends - are we at Plague at the beginning of remake, currently, or after beating the game?
[7:54:55] <+aspirationdeath> @citrousct hes just saying fandoms are dogmatic
[7:54:58] <Tikigod784> vampires make zombies in some depictions though.... man, I'm glad I don't watch em any more
[7:55:02] <KaiserMario> I'm sure Plague's Heartless could beat Plague's Nobody...
[7:55:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> @CitrousCt Weak choice on my side right? Is going against what the other person believes the truth to be.
[7:55:18] <Tikigod784> @Gavaline Plague's spite post FF7 Remake in its entirety
[7:55:20] <CitrousCt> But at the same time, most of the candidates in Deadliest Warrior operate under extremely different warfare doctrines that make it difficult to compare in the first place
[7:55:27] <%JailShmixRemix> Use tifa's limit
[7:55:30] <Tikigod784> It will eclipse the sun like in huge quest
[7:55:51] <Naho_Saenoki> The only DeathBattle video I watched that I actually liked was the Lion-O Vs. He-Man fight.
[7:55:52] <Gavaline> @Tikigod784 ENTIRE remake as in this game or all of the sequels?
[7:56:27] <%caramello_man> celebrity deathmatch is better than all that dumb nonsense
[7:56:47] <GeltonZ> @Gavaline From my understanding this is Plague's first playthrough but he knows about the ending
[7:56:48] <+aspirationdeath> @citrousct but alm based on perfectly measurable criteria like materials, body size, diet etc
[7:56:51] <+StreamStopA> Hi all. Did he fight the time ghosts yet?
[7:56:57] <Naho_Saenoki> I mean, Celebrity Deathmatch doesn't even pretend to take itself seriously.
[7:56:59] <%JailShmixRemix> yes
[7:57:00] <WMGreywind> Celebrity Deathmatch is dumb nonsense.
[7:57:03] <WMGreywind> Which is why it's infinitely better.
[7:57:14] <%caramello_man> exactly
[7:57:16] <KaiserMario> @hntronium You can, but for instance, there a Spider-man video that they say he can lift upwards of 50 tons because of the famous lifting debris moment, when on his Marvel official profile says his limit is 10 tons, so it's not going to work, if you want to rely on consistency
[7:57:17] <+aspirationdeath> also*
[7:57:24] <Triblade1992> ouch
[7:57:28] <GeltonZ> Well we're still here
[7:57:32] <@dcn2049> yeah that might be on your end
[7:57:34] <hntronium> @KaiserMario Which makes it bad.
[7:57:41] <Tikigod784> @Gavaline all the parts, dlc, and post-credits secret cutscene
[7:57:46] <%JailShmixRemix> :(
[7:58:16] <Explodincatz> Limit breaks can whiff so much in the remake
[7:58:19] <Tikigod784> featuring dante from devil may sparda
[7:58:28] <KaiserMario> Also, DC has the Flash, who just breaks everything... It's pointless to even argue when they have "faster than light" man as a character
[7:58:38] <sadboy_otoroshi> We are banging our head against the wall to other peoples boundless idiocy. Please stop...
[7:58:55] <hntronium> @KaiserMario Something that comes to mind is that I also try to take story tone into context so I can excuse things. It's only when it's really really egregious that I voice my annoyance.
[7:59:01] <sad_toast_> ending stream?
[7:59:13] <Triblade1992> cool
[7:59:20] <arkv01> I'm kinda disappointed by cloud's english VA, everyone else is super good
[7:59:27] <%JailShmixRemix> but it broke anyway
[7:59:29] <arkv01> whereas in the japanese dub everyone is shit EXCEPT cloud's VA
[7:59:32] <sadboy_otoroshi> good morning i guess.
[7:59:32] <Triblade1992> yay!
[7:59:36] <hntronium> And yes, how any Comics handle speedsters is horrible.
[7:59:36] <Quiet__Viking> was that boss fight fun? it looked so monotonous
[7:59:36] <CyberDingus> Barret grabbed her like a small girl
[7:59:45] <hntronium> Not yet
[7:59:45] <Frankomancer> i jjst had an ad, what just happened
[7:59:48] <Sokumotanaka> you say that...
[7:59:50] <SupportWriter> 👻
[7:59:52] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I mean. He still fell.
[7:59:53] <KaiserMario> @hntronium Yeah, I hear you... But these poor writing decisions just make reading comics a nuisance
[7:59:53] <hntronium> Just an explanation for now
[7:59:55] <Triblade1992> explaining how he survived the fail
[7:59:59] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hundreds and hundreds of feet
[8:00:07] <+EpicureanIguana> Here it comes chat PepeLaugh
[8:00:08] <Tikigod784> time ghosts broke his fall

[8:00:10] <Triblade1992> i guess the original couldn't do that
[8:00:10] <%JailShmixRemix> PLOT CONDOMS
[8:00:12] <Gavaline> @Tikigod784 Post remake 1, his spite towards plot ghosts is stronger due to maximum plot ghost saturation and direct comparison to the original story. Post EVERYTHING, Plague is stronger due to Nomura writing and direction making us fondly remember the time ghosts as being not so bad compared to what it becomes
[8:00:15] <sadboy_otoroshi> Expecto patronum
[8:00:16] <+aspirationdeath> @sadboy_otoroshi thats just the tragedy of human communication innit?
[8:00:19] <+muzzle_roar24> Plot Ghost LuvPeekR

[8:00:38] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Oh! I was about to say!
[8:00:41] <arkv01> yeah I thought it was zack
[8:00:43] <MartiusGW> why two clouds?

[8:00:45] <arkv01> super weird
[8:00:49] <oniwahoo> Zack, go home, you're fuckin dead
[8:01:01] <hntronium> It's not Zack, but it's totally Zack
[8:01:02] <GenericTwitchAcc1> Kreygasm selfcest

[8:01:40] <KaiserMario> Oh HERE COMES JESUS
[8:01:43] <Flamethrowerman09> Sephiroth has never been the same since after the original game.
[8:01:44] <Tikigod784> is Rude about to use his wrestling moves on Plague?
[8:01:45] <MartiusGW> who is Sephiroth?
[8:01:51] <Sokumotanaka> Sephiroth: I'm gonna clap them cheeks cloud
[8:01:53] <+lordericter> oh its THE church
[8:01:58] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's fucking Aeris goddamnit.
[8:01:59] <ahaegotrigger> I would kinda love a sephiroth everywhere system because itd hilarious
[8:01:59] <TalisKanju> Yes it is
[8:02:00] <Jrockoni> the Sephiroth everywhere system! brought to you by Squar Enix

[8:02:26] <Run44forrest> i hate her already
[8:02:28] <Triblade1992> It's correct in thte west. Aeris in Japan. Aerith in America. Tina/Terra and Eclair/Clair (Lightning) Farrron do this too
[8:02:30] <+Daniel_Is_I> I'm really not fond of her voice.
[8:02:33] <Owkono> my game says Aeris so that's cannon to me
[8:02:39] <stratfel112> flowers broke his fall eh?
[8:02:43] <oniwahoo> Yeah.... did the flowers cushion his fall, Aerith? Is that how he survived?
[8:02:48] <Explodincatz> Paige does a good impression of her
[8:02:58] <SpookyCookieMonster> now this is a stteam
[8:03:01] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's Aeris in Europe so you hotdog eaters can shut it.
[8:03:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> The church from advent children holy f*ck!!!
[8:03:07] <Tikigod784> was that a Flash Forward?

[8:03:11] <kurific> m64Perfect
[8:03:12] <%JailShmixRemix> WTF PLAGUE, SPOILERS
[8:03:12] <GenericTwitchAcc1> SPOILERS
[8:03:12] <+MisterRockett> They seemed to imply it was in her ribbon but I couldn't see it.
[8:03:12] <Tikigod784> are we alternate timelines now?
[8:03:12] <CaramelTaffy> Plauge! How could you
[8:03:14] <CrowbarFacelift> RUINED
[8:03:18] <KaiserMario> Oh god... I feel NOTHING for this character...
[8:03:19] <arkv01> no shutup she lives in our balls!
[8:03:19] <Run44forrest> oh NO
[8:03:20] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I CAN SEE THE FUTUREEE
[8:03:24] <ahaegotrigger> I heard she fell for Sephiroth
[8:03:24] <MKUltima> Plot twist, Cloud dies in this version
[8:03:25] <hntronium> Paige's impression flipflops from just right to a wee bit too low
[8:03:26] <Shemegory> Ahhh.. good old aersdies, spent my teenage users using that website
[8:03:28] <Huntercd> She sucked compared to Tifa
[8:03:31] <+muzzle_roar24> Nomura change the timeline evo19MindBlown
[8:03:35] <stratfel112> Wait shouldn't she know he's a terrorist now? the whole last level was broadcasted everywhere
[8:03:36] <CaramelTaffy> can't die in this game if you don't go to the temple
[8:03:40] <KaiserMario> YA THINK????
[8:03:41] <TalisKanju> CLOUD CAN SEE THE FUCKING FUTURE?!
[8:03:44] <sadboy_otoroshi> She ded
[8:03:44] <kurific> i hate nomura
[8:03:47] <Run44forrest> we're in another timeline NotLikeThis
[8:03:49] <+StreamStopA> It falls on what?
[8:03:55] <+EpicureanIguana> pls Nomura sir have mercy on my poor soul NotLikeThis
[8:03:56] <GeltonZ> @Huntercd And Jessie. This game makes me like Jessie a lot.
[8:03:57] <sad_toast_> she dies? not if the Plot Ghosts have anything to say about it!!!
[8:03:58] <MartiusGW> save xxxx dlc coming soon?!
[8:03:59] <Frankomancer> nomura is a massive hack
[8:04:04] <KaiserMario> Oh yes! PLEASE GO OFF ELI!!!
[8:04:10] <+Daniel_Is_I> A good story is still good even if the entire plot's been summarized for you.
[8:04:12] <Owkono> nomura ruins everything he touches
[8:04:17] <Run44forrest> NotLikeThis fuck it i dont care just keep jessie around
[8:04:18] <EuropanLamprey> "Cloud becomes the strongest in the universe but still doesn't do craaaaaap"
[8:04:23] <hntronium> Nothing wrong with that
[8:04:23] <Frankomancer> he has the writing abilites of a 12 year old
[8:04:26] <oniwahoo> He's fan service
[8:04:29] <Tikigod784> Vader shows up earlier in Rogue One
[8:04:30] <GenericTwitchAcc1> nice.
[8:04:30] <MKUltima> Nomura's the new Kojima
[8:04:32] <Gavaline> It's not foreshadowing if you flat out write the plot points in psychic premonitions
[8:04:35] <Tikigod784> he scares the general science man
[8:04:38] <arkv01> the handjob is real to me dammit
[8:04:40] <MartiusGW> what if this cloud just jumped from kingdom heart?
[8:04:40] <sadboy_otoroshi> *Magic Fingers*
[8:04:44] <+professormorrigan> YUP
[8:04:46] <MartiusGW> nomura multiverse!
[8:04:48] <Triblade1992> Kojima did this in Metal Gear Solid 4 too
[8:04:48] <hntronium> Fuck them though
[8:04:49] <KaiserMario> You mean Darth Vader holding his breath for a jump scare?
[8:04:51] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes they've gone past ham they're now at the whole hog
[8:04:55] <+professormorrigan> Never played, super confusing :)
[8:04:56] <Explodincatz> i never plated 7, but always heard she died
[8:05:00] <thecrazyanbu> Darth Vader showing up at the end of Rogue One does tie it into A New Hope though
[8:05:13] <Tikigod784> "don't CHOKE on your ambitions Director."
[8:05:14] <sad_toast_> 23 friggin years ago
[8:05:17] <hntronium> Sure you can
[8:05:24] <hntronium> FF7R is doing it right now
[8:05:25] <oniwahoo> Clearly you can because that's what they did lol
[8:05:29] <C__Lab> Yeah I have no idea what’s going on
[8:05:30] <EuropanLamprey> It's almost like a remake should be able to stand on it's own two legs
[8:05:35] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Oh there's going to be some SHIT, son.
[8:05:41] <hntronium> OH MAN
[8:05:45] <Triblade1992> okay, cya Plague
[8:05:47] <hntronium> JUST BATTLES AWAY
[8:05:49] <sadboy_otoroshi> o well
[8:05:50] <+UnwoundCaesar70> ooo we saving this
[8:05:50] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Like IMMEDIATELY.
[8:05:51] <+EpicureanIguana> the trailers dont even show the half of it, you are in for a surprise LUL
[8:05:52] <Gavaline> The fact that they remade it in the first place is due to fan and pop culture directly influencing and causing the story
[8:05:53] <sad_toast_> cliff hanger 👌😎
[8:05:58] <Run44forrest> gn daphSlep
[8:05:59] <KaiserMario> There are MANY people who will play this game and were born MUCH after the original was released
[8:06:00] <oniwahoo> Alright, have a good night, y'all!
