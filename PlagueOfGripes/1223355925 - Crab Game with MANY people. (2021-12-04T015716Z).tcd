[0:25:32] <ThereIsNoJustice> this was made by 1 guy. He's got a 15 min youtube vid on how he made it
[0:27:04] <CaerwynMontale> And I bet he made a decent amount on it by now too
[0:27:12] <Arashidrgn> I can already tell this has better movement than Fall guys in that you're not momentum sliding all over the place
[0:27:18] <CaerwynMontale> Hanging off the popularity of Squid Games
[0:27:28] <ThereIsNoJustice> he's using networking provided through steam, so it should be pretty good

[0:28:28] <+kachucho> fall guys pre season stuff was peak fall guys
[0:28:53] <ThereIsNoJustice> @PlagueOfGripes the bridge games are all about speechcraft. You wait until there's 40ish seconds and say something like "it takes 40 seconds to cross, we gotta go now!" and stuff like that
[0:29:00] <+kachucho> then crowns became worthless, and gameplay became repetitive
[0:29:03] <ThereIsNoJustice> it's all about sales. Get the plebs to cross

[0:35:27] <Arashidrgn> is it proximity voice?
[0:35:43] <+king_wragles> they do realize they're all doomed right?
[0:36:04] <%bettysharkface> Oh no explosion water
[0:36:09] <Arashidrgn> it might be proximity depending on the game mode
[0:36:24] <+king_wragles> "lol" "lmao"
[0:36:26] <ThereIsNoJustice> if you can't swim, you explode when you touch water. That's why you take swimming lessons as a kid
[0:36:38] <CaerwynMontale> Oh no, TruNoom? I hope he's matured since I last saw him.
[0:36:54] <+kachucho> @thereisnojustice fish from the depth actually explode on the surface
[0:37:22] <%bettysharkface> Cuddle puddle let's goooooo

[0:40:33] <%cosmicleviathan18> push someone out
[0:41:29] <%bettysharkface> So this is basically what if Fall guys was toxic
[0:42:22] <ThereIsNoJustice> it's funny because fall guys was already squid game before squid game

[1:13:11] <%studleydoorite> I think it's been 3 years for me
[1:13:32] <ThereIsNoJustice> nobody knows how the actual squid game works tho
[1:13:40] <Samex_Comex> Eggs!
[1:13:46] <ThereIsNoJustice> which would make playing it pretty funny
[1:13:58] <+Scevda> Sperm balls
[1:13:59] <%bettysharkface> I am allergic to lava
[1:14:08] <+king_wragles> well, that was a good effort
[1:14:13] <%bettysharkface> it gives me very bad kin irritation

[1:14:26] <Samex_Comex> I have not seen these stages
[1:14:28] <cap_bon> hot hot hot
[1:14:54] <cap_bon> I dont think alot of people did alright on this map
[1:15:15] <%bettysharkface> Would you play it with Whinery folks?
[1:15:52] <biglomix> you need to scream more to be more popular
[1:16:32] <%bettysharkface> I think it would be more fun to play with a smaller group of not screaming people
[1:17:47] <biglomix> I miss stickys from gears of war
[1:17:59] <marlowe86> Why are screamy streamers popular? Are there that many preteens on here?
[1:18:34] <biglomix> ya appeals to younger, more younger people on here
[1:19:07] <biglomix> I had thanksgiving with a 3 yr old, my god they are weird
[1:19:39] <%bettysharkface> Yeah yeah trash
[1:20:16] <biglomix> did someone throw this game together with unity assets?
[1:20:26] <%bettysharkface> Oh man
[1:20:33] <marlowe86> Yeah. That young they have no filter yet so they just yell everything they think of or see.
[1:20:44] <ThereIsNoJustice> it is made with unity. There's a vid on youtube by the guy who made it
[1:20:45] <+daveronald> its ice so you slide
[1:21:11] <+Scevda> *Baby noises*
[1:21:24] <Samex_Comex> Betrayal!
[1:21:37] <%bettysharkface> Yeah looks like cover works
[1:21:44] <%bettysharkface> I wouldn't trust it too much though
[1:21:47] <cap_bon> well this will be a short game at least
[1:21:49] <%bettysharkface> Game is jank
[1:22:35] <cap_bon> I like the ones with a bit of tension
[1:22:44] <PhelixNaamun> Grove Street
[1:22:56] <%bettysharkface> oof
[1:22:57] <marlowe86> Seems like the kind of game that by its very nature is jank on purpose.
[1:23:03] <%bettysharkface> I do like the fake out
[1:23:20] <Samex_Comex> Mmm human jerky
[1:23:23] <biglomix> like a civil war doctors tent

[1:26:29] <KitsuneManami> Still incredibly loud :P
[1:26:45] <%bettysharkface> Speed run let's gooooo

[2:24:30] <Oprender> LUL

[2:26:01] <KitsuneManami> torso
[2:26:04] <%bettysharkface> I think it might be a torso
[2:26:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> it's the funny bone plagueLUL
[2:26:33] <%Explodincatz> I like the falling flatforms one the best
[2:26:43] <+king_wragles> that removed a crown from play too
[2:26:45] <KitsuneManami> xD
[2:26:49] <%bettysharkface> Woof
[2:26:57] <KitsuneManami> I need to play this with a Duke Nukem soundboard
[2:27:20] <+king_wragles> oh, no it's there lol
[2:27:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> duke nukem soundboard sounds awesome
[2:27:48] <KitsuneManami> HAHA
[2:27:55] <%cosmicleviathan18> he had it last
[2:28:33] <%bettysharkface> Some people seem to be raging out
[2:28:42] <KitsuneManami> stop STARING at Plague Dark
[2:29:35] <KitsuneManami> Hate when Jump decides to not work
[2:29:42] <%bettysharkface> Oooh, we sweatin'
[2:29:55] <KitsuneManami> Field of View seems to help a bit
[2:30:13] <KitsuneManami> scared me >_>
[2:30:19] <+roderick_legend> Yo plague, how the Genshin adventure is going?
[2:30:24] <whispersilk001> Oh they changed that, it used to be even if 13/13 got on that platform, they could get knocked off.
[2:30:35] <%bettysharkface> Yeah I could never get past the mountain style courses
[2:30:42] <KitsuneManami> Who do you have so far in Genshin?
[2:30:50] <KitsuneManami> Ninguang? shes awesome
[2:31:12] <KitsuneManami> Ninguang at c6 is super strong
[2:31:23] <%bettysharkface> The thing about genshin is that I have no idea what the story is, people only ever talk about which waifu they have, and that concerns me
[2:31:28] <KitsuneManami> China~
[2:31:34] <theanora1> Noelle
[2:31:36] <+roderick_legend> Noelle
[2:31:40] <KitsuneManami> Noelle? her and Nignuang together are Strong
[2:31:44] <+V3RTIGO_222> OH SHIT
[2:32:07] <KitsuneManami> Yoiymia
[2:32:10] <KitsuneManami> oh Xiangling
[2:32:22] <theanora1> the Spiral Abyss
[2:32:30] <$SWFanatic> the furtive genshin, so easily forgotten
[2:32:33] <theanora1> that's not too hard actually
[2:32:33] <KitsuneManami> You got  Yae fox girl and Shenhe coming soon
[2:32:46] <KitsuneManami> RIGHT!?
[2:32:52] <KitsuneManami> Wait till you get to the Ice Mountain
[2:32:53] <Samex_Comex> All I know is people want to eat piemon, who is not a digimon
[2:32:54] <%cosmicleviathan18> cook girl sounds cute
[2:33:00] <HeroToxiko> she is an hm slave basically
[2:33:03] <Teewood_Flam> amber has utility
[2:33:06] <+roderick_legend> she is usefull in later maps as well, exploration wise, is pretty useful
[2:33:08] <theanora1> Amber is fine until you get something better later
[2:33:25] <theanora1> If you can get Yanfei, she's SUPER strong
[2:33:34] <KitsuneManami> learn the quick menu key to change Characters, you'll be doing it a lot to do the Puzzles lol
[2:34:10] <%Explodincatz> its why i never picked it up
[2:34:15] <Samex_Comex> Dosh got the dosh
[2:34:20] <KitsuneManami> oh those are people wanting to take your Special Materials that have a day or two timer
[2:34:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> Chad mindset
[2:34:24] <+PatNTheHat> The community is kinda toxic
[2:34:37] <+PatNTheHat> They really like the N word and blasting music in VC
[2:34:37] <%bettysharkface> I think Dacon is playing it, might be able to help you
[2:34:42] <HeroToxiko> the randos are trying to steal your resources
[2:34:43] <KitsuneManami> @PatNTheHat just the loud minority on twitter
[2:34:49] <KitsuneManami> @HeroToxiko exactly
[2:34:51] <theanora1> I don't think there's a way to not menu hard swap on PS4/5
[2:35:01] <+roderick_legend> farmin primo gets easier the longer you go, events tend to be very generous giving away the thing
[2:35:13] <KitsuneManami> Yea
[2:35:20] <KitsuneManami> Rip
[2:35:21] <%bettysharkface> Huh
[2:35:23] <HeroToxiko> well
[2:35:29] <Samex_Comex> Time to dance
[2:35:30] <KitsuneManami> Do some rolls on genshin

[2:36:10] <%bettysharkface> Yeah, I think it'd be fun
[2:36:19] <KitsuneManami> Borderline impossible if u get those rock stages
[2:36:23] <KitsuneManami> unless they decrease the rocks
[2:36:24] <%bettysharkface> With a smaller group I think you'd actually get to talk to people more
[2:36:30] <theanora1> it might be fun with the normal crew
[2:36:46] <+DZiffer> Hey Plague, what conclusion did you reach on Smolstackmon?
[2:36:47] <KitsuneManami> you'll be surprised how many people enjoy watching that lol
