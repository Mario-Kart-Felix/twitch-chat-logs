[0:06:27] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes atleast you have talents to fall onto, Pat dont
[0:06:31] <Void_The_Dark> If the masturbation is missing then the entire life style falls apart.
[0:06:31] <hntronium> JESSIE
[0:06:33] <cochramd1992> now there's a chunky boy
[0:06:34] <$cardboard_boxy> Imagine all the time you could free up if you were allowed to masturbate while streaming.
[0:06:37] <hntronium> I LOVE YOU JESSIE
[0:06:39] <Sir_stride> but shut up tho
[0:06:41] <BillieNoMates> Its so they dont get sand in their boots Eli
[0:06:42] <$SGrim> Plague is a man of culture. Mostly the cultures growing on his socks, but culture none the less.
[0:06:44] <BillieNoMates> Jeez

[0:07:13] <Solidus_113> not yet
[0:07:15] <+TheGenieA1> why is wedge the best final fantasy character
[0:07:21] <LunarRemix> You could in the original, but it would call you just EX-SOLDIER, no?
[0:07:23] <$sleepy_coffee> The form fitting titty armor keeps them from clapping and alerting guards
[0:07:26] <adambrycethomas> god the sine on thast swords edge
[0:07:27] <BillieNoMates> Probably unlock them as you progress
[0:07:33] <+TheGenieA1> PHYS X
[0:07:34] <+Diabetic> He's got a materia in slot 1
[0:07:38] <joylent_blue> box physics PogChamp
[0:07:40] <$cardboard_boxy> Cloud's titties don't even have armor
[0:07:41] <BillieNoMates> Shinra grade boxes
[0:07:41] <adambrycethomas> that music
[0:07:44] <Solidus_113> The demo is very controlled and will slowly give you the options
[0:07:44] <laserbeaming> Punish the boxes
[0:07:48] <BillieNoMates> Stronger than giant ass super soldier sword
[0:07:49] <+not_crabby> is there dmpster physics

[0:08:19] <joylent_blue> they just really hate Cloud
[0:08:21] <Sir_stride> because shut
[0:08:22] <+personamanthing> anime
[0:08:23] <Monkeyweed21> The Shinra helmets were designed badly on purpose
[0:08:25] <BillieNoMates> You saw them behind them
[0:08:26] <goose_attack_almanac> Because they aren't as bishi
[0:08:31] <+TheGenieA1> they only have eyes for cloud's abs
[0:08:37] <+joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> It's no secret, I am a full out pervert
[0:08:46] <Solidus_113> options button
[0:08:47] <BillieNoMates> Cant touch Barret. Race relations etc
[0:08:57] <YakumoYomi> Can't give the black man no grief
[0:08:57] <j0ustar> I make it my own headcannon that the shinra helmets are trash so they can't see shit
[0:08:58] <BillieNoMates> Attack Gast*
[0:09:00] <Murphio_GS> Woah
[0:09:03] <$doomp12> my guess is they are just anti-aryan

[0:09:16] <+Regular_Obbi> This is gonna be like, Kingdom Hearts combat isn't it
[0:09:19] <$sleepy_coffee> Would of been silly if swinging a large sword would only hit one person
[0:09:20] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes You got the Potion already
[0:09:22] <Sir_stride> HE SHOULD HAVE 2
[0:09:23] <+Regular_Obbi> hold Square to Win
[0:09:28] <BillieNoMates> Cloud doesnt loot the dead now
[0:09:29] <+TheGenieA1> the guns look cool why dosent cloud have a gun
[0:09:30] <Ether101_Prime> Just wait until you see what's in the next room.
[0:09:41] <+RoByte2> You are SOLDIER 1st class after all, you should be a badass :)
[0:09:44] <cochramd1992> @TheGenieA1 because sword
[0:09:47] <KitsuneManami> he "dropped" the potion
[0:09:48] <adambrycethomas> wow its literally just a japanese train station
[0:09:55] <Murphio_GS> I remember when you complained that you love final fantasy seven because you played it as a baby
[0:09:56] <hntronium> No thunder?
[0:09:58] <+TheGenieA1> @cochramd1992 be like bloodborne have a sword and gun
[0:09:59] <jo_vo> You don't knock out the dude with the potion. It's a gimme.
[0:10:04] <+Diabetic> He's got a materia there so you may not have the option yet?
[0:10:05] <Ether101_Prime> Crisis Core reference.
[0:10:11] <$pennykettle_> Is this the start of the game or is the demo a bit in
[0:10:12] <hntronium> God I love Jessie
[0:10:15] <Monkeyweed21> Is there a Skinship option that lets me use the touchpad to rub Cloud's butt?
[0:10:21] <TheAsylumCat> plagues gonna be nit picky as fuck because that's how he has fun.
[0:10:35] <j0ustar> Jessie please survive this time around
[0:10:40] <+TheGenieA1> Theres a mini game where you condition cloud's hair

[0:11:08] <Solidus_113> you have one pip
[0:11:15] <Triblade1992> The Co Director on this (Motomu Toriyama) was the leading director of the Midgar section of FF7, FF10 games and FF13 games. This game is going to be Miidgar Section The Game which the original FF7 was almost turned into by Motomu Toriyama
[0:11:19] <BillieNoMates> NICE
[0:11:22] <Sir_stride> it's a ability
[0:11:22] <hntronium> nice
[0:11:25] <BillieNoMates> Cloud just talking shit as he goes

[0:11:46] <+shinji_ifrit> indeed
[0:11:49] <$cardboard_boxy> There is an FF15 stank here already, but it's a better stank
[0:11:51] <Deadbulky> Youll see
[0:11:54] <Sir_stride> punisher does more damage but you move slower
[0:11:55] <joylent_blue> it'll tell you

[0:13:22] <BillieNoMates> Purchase game is the only option Square wants

[0:13:49] <Triblade1992> Yeah this is DEFINTELLY going to be Miidgar Section: The game. guess they loved what Motomu Toriyama almost turned the original FF7 into so much they made the Remake to be like it
[0:13:54] <+FunkyRot> FF9 is better

[0:14:20] <Monkeyweed21> SHINING FINGER
[0:14:24] <studleydoorite> I like your voice, the things you say not always so much
[0:14:25] <KitsuneManami> It's the Demo man =\

[0:14:55] <MartiusGW> oh no
[0:14:55] <joylent_blue> we should have the option to make the menu BLIND you upon opening it
[0:15:02] <TheAsylumCat> @daxalog sounds like something kojima would do
[0:15:06] <YakumoYomi> May Yevon bless you, brudda
[0:15:11] <Monkeyweed21> Inherited the hopes of Gackt
[0:15:13] <KitsuneManami> It's saying ZAAAAAAACK without Spoiling it
[0:15:19] <j0ustar> Not sure if cloud's hair is SPIKIER or less spiky
[0:15:19] <Hydrapissed> nah its a boss wep made from zacks soul
[0:15:20] <BillieNoMates> Because of cost
[0:15:21] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[0:15:24] <+shinji_ifrit> "those who fight" love it
[0:15:24] <Coystick> You think the pointy anime facial traits are weird on a realistic looking person, what if they stylized the characters to look like FF7's concept art?
[0:15:28] <$cardboard_boxy> Bronze socks
[0:15:28] <trianglehat> bronze is brilliant
[0:15:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> seems spikier to me
[0:15:30] <BillieNoMates> Bronze isn't as cheap as steel
[0:15:34] <LunarRemix> Isn't bronze super soft though?
[0:15:36] <BillieNoMates> Nope
[0:15:38] <joylent_blue> demoted
[0:15:38] <TheAsylumCat> @j0ustar more fluffy
[0:15:39] <Sir_stride> nope
[0:15:42] <Sir_stride> yup
[0:15:43] <Triblade1992> I think it's because pretty much EVERYONE knows the plot of FF7 at this point though
[0:15:43] <Sedrelic> i mean is just shiny copper
[0:15:44] <manwithaxe> Buster Sword is really more Getsuga Tensho than dragonslayer here
[0:15:44] <hntronium> OMINOUS SYMBOL
[0:15:45] <$SGrim> Toggle Paige? Why would you ever want Paige turned off?
[0:15:46] <Vohs_Bru> because coppper got expensive
[0:15:47] <+Heart0fInk> Probably for the demo
[0:15:48] <+TeethMuncher> You're brave enough from the get go
[0:15:51] <Deadbulky> MENACING
[0:16:01] <Solidus_113> You needed something for a heavy attack
[0:16:03] <Sir_stride> just jump
[0:16:07] <Sir_stride> das ir
[0:16:10] <Sir_stride> it*
[0:16:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah...make sure to be close enough to the target for that shit
[0:16:13] <Hydrapissed> me getting up in the morn is my limit break
[0:16:45] <Vohs_Bru> Plague sleeps with his sexy phone tonight
[0:16:45] <+Hobojo153> Yeah
[0:16:52] <TechDragon_Z> Thundaga and Firaga I think
[0:16:52] <pureotome> yup
[0:16:53] <+psydaku> yep
[0:16:54] <Sir_stride> bolt and ice
[0:16:58] <KaironFortressKnight> Bolt and Ice
[0:16:59] <TechDragon_Z> Or was it ice
[0:17:01] <Murphio_GS> Cloud = lightning
[0:17:02] <Masterchiefaron> @plagueofgripes Hello hello
[0:17:02] <j0ustar> @TheAsylumCat it really is which makes it more amazing
[0:17:04] <Murphio_GS> makes sense
[0:17:05] <Monkeyweed21> They need to get as far away from Lightning as possible
[0:17:06] <+Scevda> Bolt and Ice
[0:17:06] <+TeethMuncher> I mean, he's got spiky yellow hair
[0:17:09] <+Hobojo153> No it was Thunder
[0:17:12] <Sir_stride> bolt and cure was given to barret
[0:17:12] <j0ustar> and lightning really is just femcloud
[0:17:13] <SummonerMagno> thunderhead
[0:17:13] <ScreamLord> Also water
[0:17:14] <laserbeaming> Thunderhead!
[0:17:14] <Ether101_Prime> In this demo Barret has Thunder.
[0:17:15] <joylent_blue> KH shortcuts
[0:17:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I know I did
[0:17:26] <jo_vo> Lightning Cloud
[0:17:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kept using the commands menu
[0:17:33] <Solidus_113> Enemies have a stagger gauge you'll fill by attacking them. When it fills they'll get knocked down and take extra damage for a bit
[0:17:34] <TheAsylumCat> @murphio_gs when you spell it out like that its blinding obvious
[0:17:37] <$sleepy_coffee> ...quacktions
[0:17:40] <jo_vo> Cumulo Fracto Nimubs
[0:17:45] <Pechugaman> Is this as bad as twitter says it is?
[0:17:45] <+Hobojo153> I know you couldn't in the original but does it bother anyone else that you can't jump
[0:17:45] <hntronium> look for little easter eggs
[0:17:46] <j0ustar> HAIR TONIC
[0:17:47] <Monkeyweed21> Gackt Brand Hair Tonic
[0:17:48] <+TeethMuncher> Love the cat poster
[0:17:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> twitter says its bad?
[0:17:57] <Sir_stride> like TEXAS over 7th heaven
[0:17:59] <+arfafax> Classic Plague, spending an hour looking at bricks on the wall LUL

[0:18:50] <BillieNoMates> Its fashion
[0:18:52] <LunarRemix> Just like in real life?
[0:18:52] <Hydrapissed> so all bags

[0:18:59] <+arfafax> Wall Market lobosQ
[0:19:04] <BillieNoMates> Night vision lens?
[0:19:09] <Sir_stride> well this is a capitalistic wasteland
[0:19:10] <Monkeyweed21> Make your own Cait Sith kit
[0:19:12] <+Hobojo153> I think that's exactly what it is
[0:19:13] <+TeethMuncher> I thought it was a movie poster
[0:19:14] <KaironFortressKnight> Cat eye cameras
[0:19:14] <Hydrapissed> oh its cait
[0:19:17] <BillieNoMates> That would be a big hit on youtube

[0:19:29] <$cardboard_boxy> hooman music
[0:19:29] <+psydaku> probably a night cam
[0:19:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the fuck are these ads?
[0:19:32] <Ether101_Prime> Banora White are the apple's from Crisis Core.
[0:19:32] <LunarRemix> We are humans. We like music.
[0:19:36] <j0ustar> NO. I REFUSE
[0:19:40] <KoryMccool> ive never hear someone describe a cats movement as crawling
[0:19:40] <+Hobojo153> Blue apples
[0:19:41] <Monkeyweed21> DUMBAPPLES
[0:19:41] <joylent_blue> that looks like a Yakuza NPC
[0:19:42] <j0ustar> RETCON BANORA
[0:19:44] <+not_crabby> LUL
[0:19:46] <+RealPT1> What is AIIIIRRRRRR?
[0:19:47] <Vohs_Bru> made by Banore White
[0:19:49] <$sleepy_coffee> Gotta make sure those feline hussies don’t get perginant
[0:19:54] <$pennykettle_> thats red I think you are colorblind
[0:19:54] <+not_crabby> gmo apples are the FUUUTURE
[0:19:55] <Pechugaman> Apples can be blue in FF
[0:19:55] <dmysta3000> dumbapples baby
[0:19:56] <$cardboard_boxy> I thought that was a Brazilian flag
[0:19:58] <GreyFoxHoundDD> God damn dumb apples making a comeback
[0:19:58] <KaironFortressKnight> crisis core apples
[0:19:58] <+psydaku> those are dumbapple
[0:19:59] <Coystick> I love my juicey!!
[0:19:59] <laserbeaming> There's the blue apples in Crisis Core
[0:20:01] <BillieNoMates> Elis never had midgar, materia infused apples
[0:20:05] <TheAsylumCat> shinra plague shinra
[0:20:05] <+Torei_san> This guy over here doesn't even like blapples
[0:20:09] <lordyuka> RaccAttack
[0:20:09] <Vohs_Bru> drop your metal slab
[0:20:10] <Ether101_Prime> Genesis and Angeal confirmed.
[0:20:11] <Hydrapissed> fat guy in last
[0:20:16] <+Hobojo153> They're too distracted by the bishi
[0:20:20] <BillieNoMates> they have a 30 degree of vision
[0:20:23] <hntronium> The guy with the big sword is more dangerous
[0:20:24] <Triblade1992> Dark Souls!
[0:20:29] <alyss988> Dark Souuuuls
[0:20:37] <jo_vo> It's no blue waffle, that's for sure
[0:20:40] <BillieNoMates> and to be honest, Cloud has a giant ass sword and not some fat guy and cute girl
[0:20:40] <joylent_blue> the lock-on system also kinda threw me off
[0:20:42] <j0ustar> Angeal was ok. Genesis and the whole clone stupidity can be lost to oblivion
[0:20:42] <Kirbachev> They probably recognise the fuckhuge sword as a SOLDIER thing and decided he's the main threat.
[0:20:43] <Coystick> Maybe they'll have a "Souls" pad config in the final release?
[0:20:47] <zk_nails> Dark Souls PogChamp
[0:20:49] <+Meteo__> can you change buttons, or have you tried that already? came here recentish
[0:20:50] <YakumoYomi> He said the name of the thing!
[0:20:50] <+FunkyRot> nop
[0:20:58] <KaironFortressKnight> nope
[0:20:59] <joylent_blue> Meteo__ not in the demo don't think
[0:21:00] <Hydrapissed> oh man wonder how crazy the sephrioth part is gana be when u get to play as him
[0:21:04] <+not_crabby> camera looks kinda wonky
[0:21:06] <+Hobojo153> I don't think you can change the buttons
[0:21:07] <+Meteo__> @joylent_blue fair
[0:21:09] <BillieNoMates> Seems you auto loot as well
[0:21:11] <Coystick> The move assist is a bit much
[0:21:18] <laserbeaming> Concept Art!
[0:21:18] <Hydrapissed> I heard there was delay combos btw
[0:21:28] <Triblade1992> Sounds like what FF15 did
[0:21:30] <+Hobojo153> I think holding is AoE but I'm not sure
[0:21:37] <$sleepy_coffee> They fart out green glitter
[0:21:38] <Coystick> Briiiiiiiiicks
[0:21:45] <$Rezca> can we get a Bricks emote?
[0:21:46] <maddragon249> Holding attack causes an aoe yeah.
[0:21:49] <Vohs_Bru> Marlow Bricks
[0:21:57] <jo_vo> Awww enemies don't fly apart via polygons. I hope the bosses at least shake uncontrollably and turn red before fading out of existence.
[0:21:59] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I wonder is Cloud is gonna be a goofy weirdo trying to be cool or a broody-bishonen man
[0:22:00] <BillieNoMates> The bricks arent flat. Lazy ass brickies
[0:22:09] <BillieNoMates> Hitler beagle
[0:22:10] <j0ustar> The uniform is what the shinra units are recognizing as SOLDIER by the way. That's the official first class uniform
[0:22:10] <joylent_blue> weird ass dog
[0:22:12] <Triblade1992> beagle with an army hat
[0:22:14] <Hydrapissed> HAIL
[0:22:17] <$pennykettle_> hes saluting with a bottle of water in his ahnd
[0:22:18] <YakumoYomi> Jar Head Beagle
[0:22:24] <+Hobojo153> Doggo says join solder
[0:22:25] <Sir_stride> Hail shines!
[0:22:28] <Coystick> Enlist your doggo in the water wars, citazen
[0:22:36] <ZE_Count> Good old SEC
[0:22:41] <AmaranthSparrow> When you salute a general they salute back.
[0:22:42] <$jobbedbone> WAR EAGLE
[0:22:45] <j0ustar> The sword was just angeal and zack not a soldier staple
[0:22:59] <+NWR_James> but they love a bunch of dogs
[0:23:01] <YakumoYomi> What? Tell me more about the evil thing.
[0:23:01] <Sir_stride> incredibly subtle
[0:23:04] <laserbeaming> College Sports are pretty evil
[0:23:08] <+Hobojo153> That's pretty good
[0:23:11] <joylent_blue> people are an afterthought
[0:23:23] <$jobbedbone> Final Fantasy: Roll Tide
[0:23:32] <+walternatorz> we work hard for the money
[0:23:39] <alyss988> LUL
[0:23:42] <Triblade1992> That's something both Nomura and Motomu Toriyama would do though Plague. I've played FF10, FF13 and the KH series. They do this ALL the time
[0:23:43] <+kingboro> its a gay mako reactor
[0:23:43] <Monkeyweed21> We work hard we genocide hard
[0:23:45] <$cardboard_boxy> Finally, we've created hard
[0:23:47] <alyss988> Workin 9 to 5
[0:23:48] <jo_vo> Cartman dressed as a plantation owner talking to the head of the NCAA about their players is a vivid memory
[0:23:50] <Vohs_Bru> We built this city
[0:23:50] <ToeBeanHeaven> This is the part where the reactor goes boom while plague is busy reading posters.
[0:24:03] <$sleepy_coffee> The#a the fuck rooms
[0:24:06] <+Hobojo153> They probably knew people wouldn't comb through it like this
[0:24:07] <+psydaku> I know Jesse's cute ass creates MY hard
[0:24:09] <Ether101_Prime> Given the Shinra are Al Bhed who go on to be blamed for everything for making money does that mean something.
[0:24:13] <Triblade1992> Kinidom Hearts did this. Yes
[0:24:15] <laserbeaming> "Barret, why did you bring me to a Gay Mako Reactor?"
[0:24:19] <+masked_hero_lucky> Triangle has a function in fights
[0:24:19] <xeros720> probably, interact prompts
[0:24:25] <+NWR_James> not on the upper plate
[0:24:28] <studleydoorite> you can't afford the rent
[0:24:28] <Monkeyweed21> Not until Advent Children
[0:24:29] <Vohs_Bru> only JAy and Mike can live in there
[0:24:32] <$pennykettle_> this looks like a good spot to find ingredients
[0:24:36] <BillieNoMates> Eli's dumpster fetish will never be fulfilled
[0:24:37] <YakumoYomi> "Cloud...I...I don't know! Look away!"
[0:24:42] <$jobbedbone> Gayfuel Mako Reactors would be too powerful
[0:24:45] <xeros720> try to break shit
[0:24:52] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes So is your full FF7 play through gonna be 4500 hours long?
[0:24:53] <AmaranthSparrow> The original has some scooby doo running through doors and popping up somewhere else.
[0:25:07] <ZE_Count> walk thru that stuff to the chest
[0:25:08] <j0ustar> Eli stares at bricks Requiem
[0:25:14] <Ether101_Prime> Don't forget the chest.
[0:25:18] <Sir_stride> chest
[0:25:28] <KitsuneManami> w ecan tell :P
[0:25:29] <+Functional_Platypus> Chest in the corner
[0:25:30] <BillieNoMates> JAPANESE?
[0:25:32] <RahnalH102> there the dog again
[0:25:33] <+Diabetic> It was young Plague's dark souls
[0:25:33] <Highwang> cool, Loveless is still around
[0:25:33] <MrHappyFunshine> These trainstations are very nice
[0:25:35] <BillieNoMates> Lazy translators
[0:25:36] <Deadbulky> Doggo
[0:25:36] <Ether101_Prime> Don't miss the chest.
[0:25:36] <ZE_Count> the dog again
[0:25:38] <jo_vo> 34 full hour and a half videos for each chapter of the game
[0:25:41] <laserbeaming> Oh no, Loveless
[0:25:42] <Deadbulky> OhMyDog
[0:25:45] <BillieNoMates> The dog is shitting
[0:25:46] <Monkeyweed21> Japarica
[0:25:49] <Triblade1992> yikes. I platninum games like FF13 and FF15 and even I think that is TOO much Plague
[0:25:55] <Ether101_Prime> Shin-Ra are Al Bhed.
[0:26:00] <MillaMoks> Man plague continually walking towards the chest and not breaking the stuff in the way and instead just turning around is driving me nuts.
[0:26:01] <+JamesCorck> You're playing the game just the way I'd play it, Plague. Keep it up with the details <3
[0:26:02] <$Rezca> keep Wutai down
[0:26:05] <+Nobrev> chest missed monkaS
[0:26:06] <AmaranthSparrow> Mash them

[0:26:09] <Deadbulky> Mash them with ur smell
[0:26:11] <LunarRemix> Shinra bad. Shinra boxes bad.
[0:26:12] <wrightlight94> you said mash

[0:26:23] <+FunkyRot> mako shart
[0:26:25] <+Qsmash_> absorb the mako into your skin
[0:26:29] <+NWR_James> A shard of a medium sized shark
[0:26:32] <manwithaxe> shard of shark
[0:26:32] <laserbeaming> Grenades!
[0:26:33] <xeros720> chunks of materia?
[0:26:36] <Sir_stride> if you're low on mp, it gives you more
[0:26:36] <jo_vo> Wakka would be foaming at the mouth
[0:26:42] <Malpheryon> Is it true that they retconned the reactor explosion into being a Shinra falseflag?
[0:26:44] <pillowwasp> Shark fragment
[0:26:45] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes Did you play Crisis Core?
[0:26:47] <xeros720> since materia is comdensed mako

[0:27:07] <Triblade1992> More like the environments from FF13.
[0:27:09] <+JamesCorck> Looking forward to whatever picture you get to draw inspired by this demo <3
[0:27:09] <laserbeaming> It's kind of Shadow Moses-ey
[0:27:14] <+Hobojo153> It does kinda look like that MGS remake that guy was making for a second
[0:27:15] <joylent_blue> Malpheryon i mean it was basically canon originally, its just more obvious now
[0:27:17] <$jobbedbone> WAY PAST COOL

[0:27:35] <Malpheryon> @joylent_blue It wasn't at all, Barret blew up the reactor. The falseflag was the plate drop
[0:27:38] <+TeethMuncher> @jobbedbone freezing
[0:27:42] <ToeBeanHeaven> Y'know...Is all this haze and fog commentary for the way things are in China's Modern Industry?

[0:29:09] <Ether101_Prime> I can't wait to hear Plauge's thoughts on what's to come.
[0:29:09] <Malpheryon> @joylent_blue That could be possible but it was still AVALANCHE that pulled the trigger. I hope they kept that because it contributes to Barret's character arc
[0:29:09] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes I think he has body armor under neath thats why he looks fat.
[0:29:10] <Coystick> Skinnyfat gangly teen

[0:30:21] <pillowwasp> Some nice hairspray
[0:30:22] <BillieNoMates> Did the steam move?
[0:30:24] <InfamousShephard> clap
[0:30:25] <alyss988> OWO
[0:30:25] <Hydrapissed> yes
[0:30:26] <+Hobojo153> Probably
[0:30:27] <+Qsmash_> I'm clapping at the screen
[0:30:28] <Hydrapissed> that is the whole game
[0:30:29] <BillieNoMates> It looked stationary
[0:30:29] <+TQuick101> the steam does move
[0:30:30] <ScreamLord> yes
[0:30:31] <Pechugaman> Most likely
[0:30:35] <ToeBeanHeaven> Yoooo, but are we gonna get Fort Condor?
[0:30:36] <Sir_stride> I'm ok with that
[0:30:36] <+Hobojo153> Did everyone clap
[0:30:37] <laserbeaming> Look at the trains instead
[0:30:39] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Now you have to RP as a lone wolf
[0:30:39] <AmaranthSparrow> Just wait until he meets Mukki.
[0:30:40] <Coystick> The giant structure is a metaphor for PENIS
[0:30:49] <joylent_blue> Malpheryon i will say that, from what i could tell, it kinda looked like the bomb failed to blow, so the shinra lasers did the job instead? but Barret and crew were none the wisers
[0:30:50] <+not_crabby> yeah in the next game cloud is gonna look at sepharoths guiant cock
[0:30:54] <j0ustar> I love this timeline we're in
[0:31:01] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes This isn't Bethesda
[0:31:03] <$jobbedbone> where the z fighting at
[0:31:06] <laserbeaming> I want untextured surfaces!
[0:31:08] <Ether101_Prime> Time to go, have fun.
[0:31:09] <+Hobojo153> They probably spent a long ass time making sure you don't
[0:31:09] <Betofall> i hope the demo isnt the best part
[0:31:11] <joylent_blue> nonethewiser*
[0:31:12] <+TQuick101> I don't like that "resume" is the options button
[0:31:14] <$pennykettle_> ever since playing souls games ive gotten used to finding at least 1 flat untextured area over a cliff
[0:31:21] <joylent_blue> fuck it BabyRage
[0:31:27] <KoryMccool> @Betofall nervous sweats
[0:31:35] <awalr> bust that borker
[0:31:40] <Solidus_113> goodbye pupper
[0:31:46] <Hydrapissed> that dog is beffy
[0:31:48] <+TeethMuncher> that's not how you pet dogs
[0:31:52] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Pretty tough dog
[0:31:54] <+not_crabby> this game is the darksouls of final fantasy!
[0:31:54] <KaironFortressKnight> accidental murder
[0:31:56] <KellBeII> no doggie!
[0:31:56] <+Torei_san> You can "Pet" the dog in FFVII R Demo
[0:31:58] <Triblade1992> Dark Souls tier doggo
[0:31:59] <Highwang> oh neat, the dogs have the same tentacle thing as Rufus' dog
[0:32:01] <hntronium> strong dog
[0:32:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's fine, use away. The ATB doesn't carry over
[0:32:07] <+JantDarvus> Why is the dog the fucking boss fight?
[0:32:11] <jorniev> BUST THAT PUP
[0:32:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> between combat
[0:32:13] <+Hobojo153> This dog is taking more damage then the people
[0:32:14] <Coystick> BORK BUSTER SWORD
[0:32:15] <Kirbachev> Dogs: The most irritating fucking mooks in every videogame, ever. EVER.
[0:32:17] <Hydrapissed> is this on like the hardest difficulty ?
[0:32:17] <+NWR_James> PET THE DOG
[0:32:18] <ZE_Count> tough doggo
[0:32:19] <BillieNoMates> Looks like you need to mix in the moves
[0:32:21] <+templar010> bioweapon
[0:32:24] <j0ustar> PUPPER POPPED
[0:32:25] <+TeethMuncher> give the dogs guns
[0:32:31] <Solidus_113> Punish the pupper
[0:32:31] <MrHappyFunshine> Omnislash that pupper
[0:32:31] <YakumoYomi> TUFF Puppy
[0:32:33] <joylent_blue> Hydrapissed normal is the hardest, in the demo anyway
[0:32:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Hydrapissed you mean normal? Yes.
[0:32:34] <+NWR_James> Pup snuffers
[0:32:35] <$jobbedbone> every day is leg day so they never have to take a break
[0:32:39] <+Jontman42> Snuff those pups
[0:32:51] <+Jonesman64> not as annoying as dark souls dogs at least
[0:32:52] <alyss988> FrankerZ FrankerZ FrankerZ
[0:32:53] <Hydrapissed> wow this is normal jesus shit is not gana die on higher modes
[0:32:55] <+Hobojo153> For a 1up
[0:32:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Hydrapissed there's normal, easy, and classic.
[0:32:58] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Two of these dogs and the reactor would be fine
[0:32:59] <$doomp12> dogs are immune to terrible guts cosplayers
[0:33:05] <j0ustar> Lightning doggos when
[0:33:05] <Solidus_113> block in punisher mode
[0:33:05] <Coystick> I barely guarded
[0:33:15] <hntronium> try using your abilities?
[0:33:23] <KaironFortressKnight> if you're in punisher mode and you guard melee, you perform a counter
[0:33:27] <ZE_Count> *Pats Doggo Head* YOU CAN FIT SO MUCH MAKO INTO THIS BAD BOY!
[0:33:39] <KitsuneManami> LUL
[0:33:45] <Triblade1992> yeah more advanced version of FF13 combat.
[0:33:45] <$jobbedbone> but are dogs immune to fan expectations
[0:33:46] <+Hobojo153> Cloud would absolutely talk to himself like that
[0:33:47] <+Jonesman64> starting out with over 1k Hp.. o the number porn is going to be HUUUGE
[0:33:48] <j0ustar> I wonder how bad fighting Tonberries is going to be
[0:33:50] <Coystick> I really don't like how you auto-magnetize to enemies from so far away.
[0:33:51] <ToeBeanHeaven> Now, question. Is that Green Materia in your sword the only one slotted into it right now?
[0:33:53] <BillieNoMates> Alot of lived in
[0:33:53] <awalr> the only thing better is casually kicking ragdolls like dark souls
[0:33:56] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Well Cloud IS crazy
[0:34:01] <joylent_blue> ToeBeanHeaven yeah
[0:34:03] <LunarRemix> Cloud shaves his armpits.
[0:34:05] <AmaranthSparrow> @ToeBeanHeaven Yep, it's fire.
[0:34:06] <LunarRemix> Huh.
[0:34:08] <+Hobojo153> That's right other Berry
[0:34:15] <j0ustar> SHHHH
[0:34:16] <laserbeaming> THEY MUST NOT ESCAPE
[0:34:18] <BillieNoMates> got to stop the raccoons
[0:34:19] <+Functional_Platypus> Free range dumpsters
[0:34:19] <+TeethMuncher> free range dumpters
[0:34:21] <alyss988> PixelBob
[0:34:25] <ZE_Count> gotta stop them homeless
[0:34:26] <+NWR_James> Free the dumpstesr
[0:34:26] <+Jontman42> Cloud is so hot
[0:34:26] <+Hobojo153> Hold more garbage
[0:34:27] <Highwang> Shinra's very anti-homeless, hence jailed trash bins
[0:34:28] <Betofall> dumpsters store mako silly
[0:34:29] <PowerfulBlackGangs> If those doggos get into the dumpsters, they're tear 'em apart
[0:34:35] <BillieNoMates> Organic free range non- gmo dumpsters?
[0:34:35] <studleydoorite> we can feed the army on cage-free dumpsters
[0:34:36] <ZE_Count> hot rods
[0:34:38] <+TQuick101> bars
[0:34:38] <hntronium> free-range dumpsters
[0:34:38] <LeChevaliere> Dumpster liberation front
[0:34:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> construction bullshit
[0:34:41] <jorniev> i hope this game is not a giant opening hour and then it sizzelz out
[0:34:41] <SleepyMaribo> scaffolding
[0:34:41] <+Jonesman64> free range dumpsters
[0:34:42] <+NWR_James> scafolding
[0:34:42] <$daveronald> scafolding
[0:34:43] <TehBrickz> Scaffolding
[0:34:48] <raichu1972> this actually looks pretty good
[0:34:49] <MrHappyFunshine> scaffolding
[0:34:49] <+kingboro> fences they havent put up
[0:34:50] <j0ustar> Eught
[0:34:54] <j0ustar> Right
[0:34:58] <Sir_stride> barret has it
[0:35:03] <+Hobojo153> I really wish you could combo swing on the boxes like that
[0:35:06] <ToeBeanHeaven> Oh neat, so does that mean that Ragnarok and the like with more than 2 slots will actually have an array of materia slots near the hilt?
[0:35:09] <TehBrickz> LUL
[0:35:11] <alyss988> Good job
[0:35:21] <+Hobojo153> Probably ToBean
[0:35:25] <Deadbulky> Lightings nice
[0:35:30] <+Qsmash_> orange and blue
[0:35:32] <+TQuick101> thats hot
[0:35:32] <RothurThePaladin> That looks good!

[0:35:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> I'm Batman
[0:35:41] <Coystick> Hair lighting porn
[0:35:43] <+TeethMuncher> Turn of the century
[0:35:43] <j0ustar> A++ lighting
[0:35:43] <YakumoYomi> 900 years old
[0:35:47] <TehBrickz> And the scale of everything is rather nice
[0:35:50] <hntronium> the power of money
[0:35:51] <+NWR_James> 9000 year old myth dragon
[0:35:54] <ToeBeanHeaven> Ultima weapon should have 8 slots divided into 4 union pairs.
[0:36:00] <laserbeaming> Ah yes I remember when I got my PS4 in 1995
[0:36:01] <TehBrickz> John Carmac is probably jealous of that light tech
[0:36:02] <Sir_stride> for a 100 year old console. its incredible
[0:36:02] <KaironFortressKnight> Console of the old world
[0:36:06] <alyss988> LUL
[0:36:07] <j0ustar> GOOD
[0:36:10] <Pechugaman> Biggs looks like a more handsome Snake
[0:36:10] <Highwang> is that a dog bat?
[0:36:12] <+JantDarvus> That is clearly a cat, not a dog.
[0:36:13] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes they are Cat Dogs
[0:36:13] <alyss988> Oof
[0:36:14] <Sir_stride> he looks like Charlie sheen
[0:36:20] <KaironFortressKnight> hah
[0:36:23] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Quote from man mauled by dog
[0:36:23] <+JantDarvus> Crossover with Monster Hunter, security officers have a Nargacuga.
[0:36:25] <+Kriptin> Dog looks like a panther with big ass ears
[0:36:25] <+Jonesman64> it does really great work for a century old console
[0:36:26] <+Jontman42> Why do the dogs have neck tails
[0:36:27] <+not_crabby> maybe its time to take a pot
[0:36:32] <FaultyBreaker> Biggs is basically Kurt Russel in Big Trouble in Little China.
[0:36:42] <Coystick> Mince that mongrel
[0:36:58] <laserbeaming> Use a Grenade?
[0:36:59] <DandyMackeroos> Snuff that pupper
[0:36:59] <Johnmaddened> Whatever.
[0:36:59] <alyss988> Whatever
[0:37:00] <Highwang> wow, Cloud stole Squall's schtick
[0:37:02] <KitsuneManami> Dodging is better
[0:37:09] <KaironFortressKnight> punisher + guard does a melee counter
[0:37:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> operator is the simple faster one
[0:37:16] <cap_bon> Are modern games just embarrassed to be associated with turn based combat these days
[0:37:18] <+Torei_san> These guard dogs sure do have neck tails
[0:37:21] <Deadbulky> It will tell u
[0:37:23] <joylent_blue> punisher is big damage
[0:37:26] <spardanwarrior> Operator is mobility, punisher is damage
[0:37:27] <KoryMccool> punisher is stronger
[0:37:31] <j0ustar> These doggos are regular ass monsters btw they're everywhere and annoying in the original/ Just wait for LIGHTNING DOGGOS
[0:37:34] <+TeethMuncher> @cap_bon yeah, it's for nerds
[0:37:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Heavy and light
[0:37:34] <+enterprise900> There will be a tutorial popup latter
[0:37:36] <wrightlight94> Punisher is stronger but cloud moves slow
[0:37:37] <+Jonesman64> these dogs are REALLY sturdy
[0:37:37] <+primax104> they'll tll you in a bit
[0:37:39] <hntronium> operator is for operating
[0:37:41] <LoneFonte> animation is longer but the combo is bigger
[0:37:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> punisher is the "strong attack". Operator is the faster
[0:37:48] <pureotome> you're slower and but stronger in punisher mode
[0:37:49] <Daxalog> @cap_bon Real time is in now
[0:37:50] <Jaller101514> crowd controo and 1v1
[0:37:54] <+thackattack00> It will give you a tutorial
[0:37:54] <Sir_stride> yes
[0:37:57] <MillaMoks> My guess is punisher is better on staggered targets.
[0:37:58] <+thackattack00> eventually
[0:37:59] <+TQuick101> and when they say slow, they MEAN slow
[0:37:59] <LoneFonte> yep
[0:38:02] <TehBrickz> Yar
[0:38:03] <wrightlight94> YEs
[0:38:05] <Deadbulky> Say if u stagger
[0:38:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz I played it already foo
[0:38:07] <RothurThePaladin> Yes
[0:38:09] <+Hobojo153> Dodging puts you back to operator too
[0:38:09] <+Nobrev> YES
[0:38:09] <Sir_stride> YES
[0:38:09] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes Operator = Multipul Enemies
[0:38:09] <+TeethMuncher> Day 1 Tech
[0:38:09] <KaironFortressKnight> punisher is big damage but you can only walk. if you block melee while in punisher, you counter
[0:38:10] <LoneFonte> uh...
[0:38:10] <+thackattack00> yes
[0:38:10] <+enterprise900> Yeah
[0:38:10] <KoryMccool> honestly punsher seems faster to me, just you have to walk aroynd
[0:38:11] <pureotome> yes
[0:38:11] <AntChodeny> punisher is slow and does more damage, but you can't block
[0:38:12] <$pennykettle_> yes
[0:38:13] <Deadbulky> Yes
[0:38:14] <+Hobojo153> maybe
[0:38:15] <wrightlight94> Yeah actually
[0:38:16] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes Punisher, 1 left
[0:38:17] <+FunkyRot> the demo is like 1 hour tops
[0:38:17] <spardanwarrior> Yeah, guarding against melee attacks with punisher does an auto-counter. And yes.
[0:38:18] <AntChodeny> yes
[0:38:18] <Sir_stride> IM STILL PLAYING IT
[0:38:18] <+JantDarvus> One is the Ifrit Gauntlets, one is Alastor
[0:38:19] <PowerfulBlackGangs> N-no
[0:38:20] <Triblade1992> I haven't played it yet. So I am watching it first timie
[0:38:21] <RothurThePaladin> LUL
[0:38:23] <+BioHunter> no ps4 so...
[0:38:25] <hntronium> b-baka
[0:38:29] <+TQuick101> you people are ENJOYING a video game?!
[0:38:30] <DandyMackeroos> Oh no chats a bunch of nerds
[0:38:31] <tanarath> plague!
[0:38:32] <TehBrickz> Grenade lol
[0:38:33] <$jobbedbone> look
[0:38:41] <studleydoorite> jermaOneguy I know everything
[0:38:53] <+enterprise900> No you were in punisher
[0:39:00] <Sir_stride> no
[0:39:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so far I haven't experience that yet
[0:39:01] <KoryMccool> not in demo
[0:39:02] <+thackattack00> no?
[0:39:02] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes they start you up at 7
[0:39:03] <wrightlight94> No
[0:39:03] <Deadbulky> Not in the demo
[0:39:04] <pureotome> no
[0:39:06] <$doomp12> no
[0:39:06] <LoneFonte> i don't think so
[0:39:06] <TehBrickz> Dang
[0:39:07] <+thackattack00> Not in the demo
[0:39:08] <studleydoorite> jermaOneguy fuck idk
[0:39:08] <Triblade1992> no
[0:39:09] <PowerfulBlackGangs> I hadn't noticed any
[0:39:12] <+Hobojo153> No Mihn
[0:39:12] <hntronium> well, you did just level up to 7 earlier
[0:39:17] <korth367> this demo is a corridor so we don't know
[0:39:17] <+HiddenPorpoise> It's a demo
[0:39:17] <+Nobrev> not in this part at least
[0:39:17] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so I'm guessing no so far.
[0:39:25] <TehBrickz> How else can you commit genocide ?!
[0:39:26] <awalr> people take 9 months to spawn
[0:39:26] <Ner234> MILLIONS Dead
[0:39:28] <BillieNoMates> You do that anyway going by Advent Children
[0:39:29] <+Hobojo153> By blowing up the reactor
[0:39:29] <AmaranthSparrow> Need to hit level 99 before leaving Reactor.
[0:39:29] <jorniev> EXECUTIONS POINTS
[0:39:31] <hntronium> no minh-mazing for you
[0:39:38] <BillieNoMates> Mako sickness for everyone
[0:39:38] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes OMG Imagin if you had to sit and watch a baby age till you can kill it
[0:39:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe in the actual game, random encounters on the world map?
[0:39:49] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Now I miss playing the old FF VIII demo from pizza hut
[0:39:54] <VoidGar> Why do you have to hold tri to pull a lever?
[0:39:54] <$jobbedbone> but does he LOVE love tifa
[0:39:55] <+Jonesman64> how are are supposed to get to lvl 99 in the damn demo if they dont respawn
[0:39:57] <YakumoYomi> You're having too much fun, Eli.
[0:40:03] <+JantDarvus> Plague you're reminding me of that god-damn Penny Arcade strip, 'spawn camping'.
[0:40:09] <+TeethMuncher> Wedge looks like such a frat boy
[0:40:11] <KitsuneManami> hes VERY CLEAN
[0:40:11] <+Hobojo153> He's helping
[0:40:15] <+TQuick101> are we proud?
[0:40:16] <pureotome> He's doing it!
[0:40:21] <Betofall> his mamma made it for him
[0:40:23] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Nice set of a shoulders for a doughboy
[0:40:24] <AmaranthSparrow> They hired you to do the fighting, too.
[0:40:25] <+Hobojo153> Hygiene is important
[0:40:26] <Sir_stride> wedge is a good boi
[0:40:31] <BillieNoMates> Wedge was hired the same day as the attack
[0:40:36] <TehBrickz> He put on his clean gear for the big raid
[0:40:36] <awalr> also he's mocap-fat like enzo in bayo
[0:40:40] <BillieNoMates> He was literally bullied into it by Barret
[0:40:46] <awalr> just mocap a random guy and fatten up the model
[0:40:46] <cap_bon> its his first day on the job dont be mean to him
[0:40:55] <Betofall> can't believe sakaguchi didn't let us see that
[0:41:01] <Triblade1992> Like I said: Nomura + Motomu Toriyama = Gold
[0:41:05] <AntChodeny> but everyday is Wedge's first day
[0:41:08] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes His mom made that outfit for his ecoterrorism, do you really think he's going to ruin it ?
[0:41:10] <+TeethMuncher> o1
[0:41:11] <studleydoorite> I like how Plague judges games based on what he can see reeeeally far away, and bricks
[0:41:13] <VoidGar> Tht's what the slash is for???
[0:41:15] <j0ustar> Yes?
[0:41:15] <cerazor01> I like the woman avalanche woman person
[0:41:16] <Triblade1992> They are the ones responsible for this game
[0:41:26] <AmaranthSparrow> Toriyama isn't involved in this at all, though, is he?
[0:41:31] <BillieNoMates> MAKO?
[0:41:35] <hntronium> I thirst for Jessie
[0:41:37] <+JantDarvus> There's no Mako in storage, he's dead :(
[0:41:45] <BillieNoMates> Holy shit Barret. This guy is working for you
[0:41:47] <Samsaz> MUTT
[0:41:47] <AmaranthSparrow> Oh, right, Toriyama is producing now I think.
[0:41:48] <BillieNoMates> and you shit talk him
[0:41:50] <$jobbedbone> Math teachers HATE zero-fill because it can be confused for empty set
[0:41:50] <studleydoorite> do you think his arm got cut off, or he's just got a weird short arm behind that minigun
[0:41:51] <ThatGuyThere03> Why is Barret such an asshole?
[0:41:54] <AntChodeny> Jessie Kreygasm
[0:41:55] <+Jonesman64> MAKO?
[0:41:59] <+Hobojo153> Barret is great isn't he
[0:42:00] <+TeethMuncher> @ThatGuyThere03 idealogy
[0:42:01] <+not_crabby> who is the va for cloud?
[0:42:02] <Triblade1992> @AmaranthSparrow Yes he is. He's the co director with Nomura. Nomura chose him because he was the lead director of hte Midgar Section
[0:42:05] <+Jonesman64> that's almost as bad ram-uh
[0:42:07] <zanzibarian_hamster> I can hear barret's voice actor repress the urge to say well shiieeet
[0:42:11] <korth367> barret is the best shit
[0:42:11] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes That Sound effect is the same from Advent Children
[0:42:19] <j0ustar> oh? memory shenanigans from the start?
[0:42:20] <jorniev> hoooly shit that made sense
[0:42:20] <AmaranthSparrow> @Triblade1992 Makes sense
[0:42:21] <Ner234> LUL
[0:42:23] <Triblade1992> @AmaranthSparrow So Motomu Toriyama is half responsible for the FF7 remake

[0:43:26] <+TeethMuncher> don't want your boobs to chafe against each other
[0:43:27] <BillieNoMates> Just wear a cotton shirt like Cloud
[0:43:28] <awalr> HACKERMAN
[0:43:29] <$sleepy_coffee> Everyone’s boobs look weird
[0:43:32] <Betofall> the underboob has the strongest metal
[0:43:32] <KoryMccool> that typing
[0:43:33] <pureotome> LUL
[0:43:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Biggs belongs in Contra
[0:43:38] <+kiwiredgrave> biggs fucks
[0:43:39] <@Nightbot> @SaltyAzteca -> MrDestructoid [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:43:39] <+Gogogolem> the armor would also collapse easier due to its bad shaping.
[0:43:40] <+FunkyRot> thot
[0:43:40] <Sartastic> she didn't design it, she's a victim of capitalism
[0:43:40] <xeros720> she is threatened by tifa
[0:43:42] <+Qsmash_> it is Nomura's vision
[0:43:42] <cap_bon> *walks up to a random npc* "your boobs look weird mam"
[0:43:43] <pureotome> he's a handsome boi
[0:43:44] <LoneFonte> Tom Cruise biggs
[0:43:48] <Triblade1992> @AmaranthSparrow it was announced 6 months ago. He was part of the project for a LONG time. He's also working on part 2 of the FF7 remake as well.
[0:43:48] <+thackattack00> Look at em slappin the keyboard
[0:43:48] <ThoughtTeaAnna> titties can point outwardly, trust me I'm an expert
[0:43:51] <AntChodeny> right? I never figure Biggs would be hot
[0:43:52] <Mr_Strut> It IS a square game.
[0:43:57] <RothurThePaladin> LUL
[0:43:57] <timbroome> He's Hot Shots Charlie Sheen
[0:43:59] <+Hobojo153> Why is everyone hot in this game
[0:44:00] <FaultyBreaker> I told you. He's Kurt Russel
[0:44:06] <studleydoorite> that makes me feel good because I look like Biggs, besides the hair and the face
[0:44:08] <+kiwiredgrave> and blonde
[0:44:08] <xeros720> it started with a padded bra and got out of hand
[0:44:08] <Coystick> He's such a DWEEEB AAHHHH
[0:44:10] <awalr> man cloud looks good
[0:44:14] <+Xogar> Plague is going to ditch both Aeris and Tifa for Biggs
[0:44:17] <+Jonesman64> Biggs > Cloud
[0:44:18] <Dumple_Roe> Biggs is some guy, he got more handsome
[0:44:23] <BillieNoMates> You'd think they'd radio forward that a member of fucking SOLDIER was attacking the reactor
[0:44:27] <eluded_> they are going with the Advent Children version of Cloud, uh?
[0:44:27] <+Jonesman64> biggs for protagonist
[0:44:28] <cerazor01> The Camera is really uncomfortably close
[0:44:30] <$cardboard_boxy> Biggs x Cloud
[0:44:32] <cerazor01> jesus
[0:44:36] <Mr_Strut> battle theme seems alright
[0:44:40] <+Jontman42> How long does Cloud spend every morning to do his hair and apply the eyeliner and whatnot
[0:44:41] <+JantDarvus> Making it rain, baby.
[0:44:45] <pillowwasp> I miss the cloud that nobody took seriously
[0:44:47] <j0ustar> Why am I getting so many lightning vibes from THIS cloud?
[0:44:51] <AntChodeny> @BillieNoMates and Cloud is still wearing his old uniform
[0:44:55] <AmaranthSparrow> @cerazor01 You can adjust camera settings in the menu
[0:44:55] <ToeBeanHeaven> It's the BAT
[0:44:57] <KitsuneManami> WHY?
[0:45:02] <Triblade1992> Arkham Knight has SUCH a bad GTA clone design
[0:45:03] <Coystick> Arkham Knight is solid and no one wants to admit it
[0:45:07] <+eanscrale> Oh I don't know how to feel about that
[0:45:25] <TheAsylumCat> I like the idea Cloud is actually a dork who thinks he's cool.
[0:45:25] <jorniev> ex ex ex and the wy wy wy
[0:45:43] <+eanscrale> Cloud is the BIGGEST dork
[0:45:57] <+Hobojo153> They're smart doors you see
[0:45:58] <Deadbulky> Jessie such a flirt
[0:45:59] <+TeethMuncher> One of those fancy blood doors
[0:46:00] <AntChodeny> @TheAsylumCat so just Cloud?
[0:46:00] <wolfman_jack21> Oh, it's Punisher because you punish enemies with counter attacks
[0:46:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> "Please stop calling me that, Cloud"
[0:46:03] <BillieNoMates> So Biggs is Solid Snake?
[0:46:09] <TheAsylumCat> @antchodeny yup
[0:46:10] <wolfman_jack21> And it's Operator because Cloud is a certified surgeon
[0:46:11] <TehBrickz> Almost looks like a young snake in that lightening
[0:46:12] <Chatterbox1991> Shepard
[0:46:14] <Chatterbox1991> Wrex
[0:46:15] <jorniev> why does he reminds me of kyle reese
[0:46:29] <$jobbedbone> WOW shes cute
[0:46:29] <+Hobojo153> Is that someone Cait
[0:46:32] <YakumoYomi> Agreed
[0:46:36] <pureotome> yup
[0:46:38] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes I think Biggs made her armor
[0:46:40] <j0ustar> Yep
[0:46:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> she's STILL extremely flirtacious
[0:46:46] <DandyMackeroos> Yeah
[0:46:46] <+jiggy_snipe> she is still flirtaous here too
[0:46:49] <ToeBeanHeaven> Jessie is best girl, you leave her and her tiddy armor alone, you bully.
[0:46:49] <Mr_Strut> and then she dies
[0:46:51] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Like you wouldn't flirt with Cloud
[0:46:51] <Coystick> such a honey-sweetie flirtlord
[0:46:52] <Sartastic> the boob goes like THIS
[0:46:52] <MillaMoks> Doors opening when the soldiers die can maybe make sense in context. Maybe the mako tech absorbs them as they disperse into life force and it powers back up the doors so they open.
[0:46:54] <+AlastorSlain> her thirst sabotages the second mission :D
[0:46:56] <+Jontman42> Put a hardhat on
[0:47:00] <laserbeaming> Well, she was talking about how hot Cloud was
[0:47:01] <%JantDarvus> JantDarvus subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[0:48:00] <korth367> someone worked on those potion eatting animations
[0:48:05] <Coystick> Jessie's gym clothes under military wear is DOING IT.
[0:48:07] <Solidus_113> it's more for balance I'd suppose
[0:48:07] <korth367> better watch them
[0:48:13] <KitsuneManami> Mako
[0:48:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Mako
[0:48:14] <+Jonesman64> eating one million potions
[0:48:14] <BillieNoMates> The organs of children

[0:48:34] <j0ustar> That was a very.....kingdom hearts effect honestly

[0:48:40] <+Jekado> i have one it tasted terrible
[0:48:46] <+Jonesman64> uncanny folding chair
[0:48:56] <+Hobojo153> Does he have a Jack Skeleton tattoo

[0:52:02] <Monkeyweed21> They don't know where Avalanche is based
[0:52:03] <Solidus_113> don cornholio
[0:52:05] <+ahdurian> you should draw those pretty eyes as a furry
[0:52:05] <xeros720> i think shinra only learned about them after this
[0:52:07] <L0rdD4ndy> kromiaSip
[0:52:07] <Sartastic> don't look at them
[0:52:08] <BillieNoMates> Jessie, PERSONAL SPACE
[0:52:09] <Coystick> Anime grunt
[0:52:09] <jacewolf_is_the_best> hope nothing happens to her
[0:52:10] <ZComiX> i think the implication is they dont know who they are. They are looking into who they are now.
[0:52:11] <RothurThePaladin> LUL
[0:52:12] <+Qsmash_> does Cloud's sword reach?
[0:52:12] <Mr_Strut> Jesus she's thirsty
[0:52:12] <VidulaSaix> They know WHO they are, but not WHERE they are
[0:52:13] <KaironFortressKnight> get that girl some water cuz jessie is thirsty af
[0:52:14] <AmaranthSparrow> Yes they absolutely did. Shinra assassinated the leader of Avalanche six years before FFVII.
[0:52:15] <InfamousShephard> im glad jessie is getting pushed hard
[0:52:15] <TheAsylumCat> small thing, apparently this remake will take in account the "expanded lore" from the other games, so plot holes abound
[0:52:15] <+Hobojo153> I mean, can you blame her
[0:52:15] <Ner234> I mean ...
[0:52:15] <jorniev> i mean
[0:52:16] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Look at him
[0:52:17] <+Jontman42> I mean I would've
[0:52:18] <+HypotheticalWalrus> i mean who wouldnt
[0:52:19] <Deadbulky> She likes strong and edgy
[0:52:19] <Highwang> I wonder if they'll keep to Jessie's plot 1:1
[0:52:20] <laserbeaming> I would have decided that too
[0:52:20] <wolfman_jack21> You would too
[0:52:21] <pureotome> can't blame her
[0:52:22] <TehBrickz> Lookin at him like " this is mine payment "
[0:52:23] <+not_crabby> lots of people want to bang on sight
[0:52:25] <BillieNoMates> Jessie is probably the Midgar bicycle
[0:52:25] <hntronium> I mean, I would have too
[0:52:26] <DandyMackeroos> Jessie pretty
[0:52:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> uunh...mmm...grunt.
[0:52:29] <coffeecar> Jessie best girl
[0:52:29] <SaltyAzteca> But he's hot
[0:52:29] <+Razputin217> T H I R S T
[0:52:31] <Coystick> Why do animes make so many little vocal noises?
[0:52:31] <FinchBot> i wanna bang loud too, jess
[0:52:32] <xxshadowxx416> he should be bigger
[0:52:34] <Exadata_> wouldn't you?
[0:52:35] <Highwang> ...his last name was Wallace?
[0:52:35] <Pechugaman> She is gorfeous
[0:52:36] <cap_bon> you mean you havent decided to bang cloud already?
[0:52:38] <Ner234> G U N
[0:52:39] <Pechugaman> all of them are
[0:52:39] <+Qsmash_> his last name is Wallace?
[0:52:45] <+Jontman42> Gun man
[0:52:47] <$cardboard_boxy> Cloud plays a bit like Gladio did in that 15 dlc
[0:52:47] <juxtest> Barret is gun
[0:52:47] <YakumoYomi> Ya'll didn't know that?
[0:52:49] <jorniev> OVERCHARGE
[0:52:54] <+jiggy_snipe> yes his last name has always been Wallace
[0:52:54] <%JantDarvus> That screen condensed: 'barret has a gun'
[0:52:58] <Deadbulky> LUL
[0:52:58] <KitsuneManami> LUL
[0:53:01] <laserbeaming> BARRET!
[0:53:01] <Coystick> Hahahaa go Barret
[0:53:02] <wolfman_jack21> Hey, that's clever!
[0:53:05] <TheAsylumCat> Cloud is beautiful and I'm glad the cross dressing bit is in the game
[0:53:05] <BillieNoMates> Whats the commands?
[0:53:05] <ToeBeanHeaven> OOOO I BEEN SHOT
[0:53:06] <Aydarkzero> Bullets can hurt me also!
[0:53:07] <+Hobojo153> Wallace Wisdom number 38 always take out the snipers first
[0:53:10] <+arfafax> Didn't you guys read the manual? LUL
[0:53:15] <Explodincatz> camera bad
[0:53:16] <Pechugaman> Barret should one shot everything
[0:53:18] <Kirbachev> That camera is atrocious
[0:53:22] <+ultrachibi> might want to adjust the camera in settings @PlagueOfGripes
[0:53:22] <Betofall> barret just flexes for guarding
[0:53:23] <iamtheTwitchghost> did he just start?
[0:53:24] <spardanwarrior> Camera wigs out here a lot
[0:53:25] <coffeecar> OVERCHARGE
[0:53:26] <VidulaSaix> Camera isnt bad, Plague just isnt moving it
[0:53:26] <+jiggy_snipe> what's a manual Kappa
[0:53:27] <+Jontman42> The camera feels a little claustrophobic
[0:53:31] <+masked_hero_lucky> Barret has tunder fyi
[0:53:34] <jorniev> holding a button to guard i kinda dont like that
[0:53:36] <+masked_hero_lucky> Thunder even
[0:53:39] <BillieNoMates> So Mash triangle?
[0:53:40] <VidulaSaix> You can pull the camera out in Settings
[0:53:41] <j0ustar> Actual reloading. huh.
[0:53:46] <Pechugaman> Damn that camera looks like shit
[0:53:49] <+Jekado> look at this RE6 camera angle
[0:53:54] <xeros720> the BIG SHOT
[0:53:55] <+enterprise900> Its not a stance switch
[0:54:00] <+Nobrev> no just press it
[0:54:02] <VidulaSaix> Then dont?
[0:54:02] <TehBrickz> Mash to win
[0:54:02] <+Hobojo153> Mash button
[0:54:04] <%Samex_Comex> Samex_Comex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Yippy skippy
[0:54:05] <KoryMccool> what
[0:54:07] <+thackattack00> you dont mash
[0:54:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just press
[0:54:11] <xeros720> or as max says, the BIG SHIT
[0:54:12] <Maids4lyfe> but that is what games are
[0:54:22] <KoryMccool> mashing is radicle, how dare you plague\
[0:54:25] <DandyMackeroos> Mashing is dum
[0:54:26] <+ahdurian> hey chat i dont know if this is a "spoiler" but anyone know how long this demo is?
[0:54:26] <+masked_hero_lucky> It's a big attack every now and then, and you can press, not mash, triangle when it's not available to charge
[0:54:29] <Deadbulky> Barret has abilities 2
[0:54:34] <Solidus_113> all this ATB
[0:54:35] <laserbeaming> It should make you jack off your controller like No More Heroes
[0:54:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wasted ATB
[0:54:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Cloud does nothing and walks aroound menacingly
[0:54:57] <+Qsmash_> I wonder if Cid is still gonna be a wife beater
[0:55:02] <BillieNoMates> Probably get 4 members
[0:55:04] <VidulaSaix> It didnt
[0:55:09] <DandyMackeroos> Just gotta damage my wrist’s constitution for this video game, no problem.
[0:55:11] <+not_crabby> it did
[0:55:12] <jacewolf_is_the_best> beep bop
[0:55:12] <Solidus_113> Dpad can switch targets when you're solo
[0:55:13] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Lock on
[0:55:13] <Triblade1992> D pad was just for movement in the original FF7
[0:55:20] <Coystick> RTWP unf
[0:55:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> slowmo not pause.
[0:55:33] <KitsuneManami> Cid isnt a wife beater in japanese, bad translations
[0:55:33] <xxshadowxx416> cure best magic
[0:55:39] <Coystick> Effectively pause
[0:55:48] <Triblade1992> Needs to learn from Hope or Prompto to HEAL YOUR ALLIES
[0:55:50] <GKannel> Abilities are only used if you tell them to
[0:55:51] <+QuadraticGravity> plague help you've been on full ATB for two minutes aaaaaa
[0:55:56] <GKannel> it's not KH
[0:55:58] <j0ustar> I hated those
[0:55:58] <+masked_hero_lucky> Nah, seems like you have to manually do everything for each character, which I'm not cray about
[0:55:59] <+FunkyRot> i cant wait for the pc mods for this game
[0:56:07] <laserbeaming> Huh, he can Terminator through attacks with Steelskin
[0:56:16] <Solidus_113> The game gives you so much ATB for free. It really wants you to use it often
[0:56:19] <+jiggy_snipe> you can set who's the lead character
[0:56:19] <YakumoYomi> Did Barrett say "Get yo ass banned"?
[0:56:21] <TheAsylumCat> Technically Barret has been being an ass to Cloud lately so his lack of heals makes sense
[0:56:22] <xxshadowxx416> yes
[0:56:23] <Aydarkzero> you can set a leader
[0:56:24] <+thackattack00> yep
[0:56:24] <AmaranthSparrow> You can change your leader in the menu
[0:56:26] <+auctober_> i think you can switch in the main menu
[0:56:27] <Explodincatz> weird
[0:56:30] <Triblade1992> Did it say R2 you could switch?
[0:56:30] <BillieNoMates> Well at least till disc 3 Kappa
[0:56:40] <+FunkyRot> @PlagueOfGripes you cant switch in the start menu thingy
[0:56:41] <DougintheTrench> !uptime

[0:56:55] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> ye
[0:56:55] <Firststrike_OW> ???
[0:56:55] <+TeethMuncher> We talking bout fish nets?
[0:56:55] <wrightlight94> Yeah sorta
[0:56:55] <+Qsmash_> sure
[0:56:56] <+thackattack00> i can see it
[0:56:56] <laserbeaming> I want to squish it
[0:56:56] <TheAsylumCat> yes
[0:56:56] <KellBeII> absolutely
[0:56:56] <DougintheTrench> I can see it.
[0:56:56] <wolfman_jack21> Yeah
[0:56:57] <Sacksquatch> Yeah
[0:56:58] <+ckangaroo15k> sure
[0:57:00] <BillieNoMates> The mesh or the hanging cloth?

[0:57:01] <red_blaster> s-sure
[0:57:02] <Johnmaddened> yep
[0:57:02] <+masked_hero_lucky> Yeah
[0:57:03] <+Kriptin> Wear the mesh
[0:57:05] <TehBrickz> Skirt for buildings lol
[0:57:07] <InfamousShephard> i have trypophobia
[0:57:08] <@Nightbot> @Teyaric -> I can do this all day... [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:57:08] <+Jontman42> It looks like it hangs well
[0:57:12] <jorniev> yes
[0:57:15] <YakumoYomi> Agreed. I have a need to touch mesh clothing that I see in stores
[0:57:18] <+Jonesman64> yes.. love the mesh
[0:57:19] <BillieNoMates> Draw Jessie in a mesh outfit
[0:57:25] <+thackattack00> nightbot takes no prisoners
[0:57:35] <+NWR_James> Nightbot hates your symbols
[0:57:36] <BillieNoMates> Safety lighting
[0:57:37] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[0:57:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> safety lights?
[0:57:38] <TehBrickz> Christmas lights probably
[0:57:39] <VidulaSaix> It's festive LUL
[0:57:43] <GKannel> LUL
[0:57:45] <+TeethMuncher> safety lighting
[0:57:49] <Mr_Strut> Shinra mandated festivities
[0:57:49] <voltvexen> I didn't even notice the seiling
[0:58:01] <Monkeyweed21> Even Shinra loves holidays
[0:58:02] <j0ustar> Makes sense
[0:58:03] <jorniev> safety?
[0:58:04] <alyss988> sylessOwO
[0:58:08] <BillieNoMates> Alot of little neat things that mean nothing
[0:58:14] <RahnalH102> certain patterns are just inherently aesthetically pleasing
[0:58:15] <TheAsylumCat> its probably for black outs
[0:58:22] <numinouswastaken> Or Maybe it's a reference to Parasite Eve and Christmas... christmas lights... yeah, I got nothing
[0:58:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yup...lasers
[0:58:28] <VoidGar> Why not just leave them on all the time?
[0:58:29] <Coystick> Here she goes being cute again!!!
[0:58:29] <jorniev> dont get hit
[0:58:30] <GKannel> yep, these lasers are silly
[0:58:30] <+thackattack00> this part makes 0 sense
[0:58:34] <+Jonesman64> maybe they're emergency lights incase the power goes out
[0:58:35] <+not_crabby> hey! amaaazing~
[0:58:37] <voltvexen> I actually like Cloud's voice
[0:58:39] <Deadbulky> Shinra
[0:58:39] <Triblade1992> Shinra does
[0:58:40] <BillieNoMates> This is to stop toilet breaks :)
[0:58:42] <+TeethMuncher> So the workers don't take too many bathroom breaks
[0:58:42] <VidulaSaix> She literally said it was a security system
[0:58:43] <+ckangaroo15k> She's so wet for cloud.
[0:58:43] <%Samex_Comex> Laser tag room
[0:58:44] <GKannel> and they are all misalligned
[0:58:44] <Iggeh0> amazon to shoot down employees on toilet breaks
[0:58:45] <+NWR_James> Jeff Bezos probably
[0:58:45] <AmaranthSparrow> More importantly, why would you have them turn off every 5 seconds.
[0:58:47] <+jiggy_snipe> Shinra hates their employees
[0:58:49] <+masked_hero_lucky> Well Shinra's cray.
[0:58:50] <+StolenPixels> StolenPixels subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:58:52] <Coystick> Someone stop Jessie being perfect.
[0:58:53] <Teyaric> It's a global holocaust factory, made of omnicide?
[0:58:53] <+Jonesman64> RE4 Time? PogChamp
[0:58:56] <TheAsylumCat> shinra doesn't give a shit
[0:58:56] <Deadbulky> Remember this is shinra were talking about here LUL
[0:58:56] <+masked_hero_lucky> Crazy
[0:58:58] <+MariMcMega> why would they time out in the first place?
[0:59:00] <juxtest> Gotta keep people out of the bathroom somehow
[0:59:01] <$cardboard_boxy> They could turn off the grid during work hours
[0:59:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I assume they're in place in off work hours?
[0:59:04] <AmaranthSparrow> "The security lasers are there for YOUR protection."
[0:59:06] <+Qsmash_> is anyone working at this time of night?
[0:59:07] <wolfman_jack21> Nothing like a walk through the incineration grid during a day at work
[0:59:11] <LeChevaliere> It has been [6] days since the last employee bisection.
[0:59:13] <+CoalSavoie> Those lasers could really use some fairly lights to warn us of them
[0:59:15] <cap_bon> What kind of PPE do you need for laser grids
[0:59:16] <+Jonesman64> I'm assuming the works have KEYS
[0:59:22] <+Jontman42> You'll get used to the rhythm after a few months
[0:59:23] <Explodincatz> get hit by the lazer
[0:59:28] <+TQuick101> I mean they probably turned them on after they saw you were there
[0:59:32] <jorniev> aaaaamazing
[0:59:37] <BillieNoMates> Try?
[0:59:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[0:59:40] <studleydoorite> @cap_bon +2 diffraction amulet
[0:59:41] <+jiggy_snipe> do it
[0:59:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you don't die
[0:59:44] <+thackattack00> it does barely any damage
[0:59:49] <reinbachthe3rd> Sup, Plague!
[0:59:51] <Mr_Strut> Barret teleported
[0:59:52] <jorniev> what a a weiird ass security sistem
[0:59:54] <BillieNoMates> Barret just ran through it
[1:00:01] <BillieNoMates> Did you hear the crackle? LUL
[1:00:08] <Solidus_113> I don't think Cloud needs all this positive reinforcement
[1:00:10] <BillieNoMates> Well its so you can see where to grab
[1:00:11] <+TeethMuncher> It just shows off where the railing is
[1:00:12] <+Kriptin> "You're making me too wet Cloud"
[1:00:13] <alyss988> HolidayLog HolidayLog
[1:00:15] <Darikethe> something for the workers
[1:00:16] <jorniev> yeah
[1:00:21] <+not_crabby> corporate sanctioned holiday

[1:00:38] <dailylifewithry> Shinra wacky doodle pizza time lasers
[1:00:39] <+TeethMuncher> that's dangerous
[1:00:39] <jorniev> imagine a security camera that turns off every 10 seconds
[1:00:40] <voltvexen> mako reacter?
[1:00:43] <VidulaSaix> Dont damage equipment
[1:00:44] <Mr_Strut> That's WAY too much work
[1:00:46] <Iggeh0> it's literally impossible you're crazy
[1:00:47] <+HypotheticalWalrus> maybe its like emergence escape lights to point out the stairs if the power goes out
[1:00:48] <VidulaSaix> yoU MUST walk
[1:00:48] <jorniev> yeah
[1:00:49] <BillieNoMates> Cant get your Soldier issue pants dirty
[1:00:49] <KellBeII> perhaps to illuminate the hand rail for workers who need it to get up and down stairs
[1:00:50] <KaironFortressKnight> no its covered in poison
[1:00:50] <studleydoorite> you can't walk past that barrier, there's a cone!
[1:00:54] <+jiggy_snipe> that's not osha certified
[1:00:56] <Solidus_113> Cloud can't jump
[1:01:11] <+Jontman42> The laser system is useless if you just move a couple crates
[1:01:16] <%Samex_Comex> This is one crazy rave
[1:01:24] <Sartastic> good job Cloud!
[1:01:26] <Darikethe> "Hey frank do you remember for the second laser grid on floor 5?"
[1:01:27] <xeros720> we need to gift plague a copy of dreams and ask him these questions

[1:01:31] <$cardboard_boxy> fuck it up tho

[1:02:13] <Solidus_113> LUL
[1:02:14] <OtakuHunterD> I'm starting to see how Midgar is gonna last for 60 hours...
[1:02:17] <Sartastic> u suc
[1:02:18] <alyss988> Too late
[1:02:26] <Darikethe> it's weird to think one of the most famous RPGs had SE go like "This needs more simple timing puzzles"
[1:02:30] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Honestly if I worked here I would probably just tank the 11 damage rather than wait for everyone
[1:02:30] <VidulaSaix> If you think this game is gonna last 60 hours you're insane
[1:02:31] <Coystick> She will no longer unsling her clam fro you
[1:02:32] <AmaranthSparrow> Here
[1:02:34] <VidulaSaix> 30 at best

[1:03:32] <VidulaSaix> 0/10 game throw it in the trash compactor
[1:03:36] <Mr_Strut> Why not activate more?
[1:03:36] <Coystick> Some of the monsters are going to look loopy in a realistic setting
[1:03:45] <BillieNoMates> Can you thunder it?
[1:03:47] <+Jontman42> He says as he's already rushed in

[1:04:30] <Triblade1992> FF13 combat coming back in
[1:04:31] <juxtest> Who gives Barret all the materia
[1:04:35] <wolfman_jack21> Oh, it's like Turn Press from SMT
[1:04:54] <VidulaSaix> Oh the demo doesnt tell you this but hit Touch pad when targeting an enemy @PlagueOfGripes
[1:04:58] <joshuaswagmastersweat> Imagine choosing to play as anyone but Cloud
[1:05:04] <HoroHoroKororo> very much like sekiro
[1:05:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah touch pad gives info
[1:05:19] <Animorphimagi> Lol better stream than Pat. Hes still talking
[1:05:35] <Solidus_113> Abuse the ATB spells more
[1:05:39] <AntChodeny> @joshuaswagmastersweat the game does have Tifa
[1:05:45] <+thackattack00> Pat literally started 3 minutes ago, ofc he's still talking
[1:05:55] <Highwang> god, the music renditions are on point
[1:05:59] <laserbeaming> Yeah, the game probably wants you to use ATB more often
[1:06:05] <+Jonesman64> O its like the thing from Xenoblade Chronicles
[1:06:18] <+Jonesman64> the trip and toppling
[1:06:19] <FrankishAxeman> Why does Cloud makes my pp so hard?
[1:06:30] <Triblade1992> Looks like we have gone from Persona 3 combat to FF13 combat to FF7 R combat
[1:06:46] <AntChodeny> @FrankishAxeman you have a thing for blondes?
[1:06:49] <Solidus_113> Don't forget Cloud's skills too, you can use the triggers to command them
[1:06:59] <wolfman_jack21> @Triblade1992 Honestly, I didn't see the last one coming.
[1:06:59] <+TQuick101> big ol' stinger
[1:07:00] <Solidus_113> you don't have to switch characters
[1:07:02] <cyberblueneon> imo this version of the song sounds too triumphant compared to the original which felt dark and mysterious
[1:07:13] <+enterprise900> You're in Punisher
[1:07:17] <+JumiElazul> FYI you can press R2 to instantly go into other chars menu :)
[1:07:24] <RahnalH102> hitting L2 and R2 swaps to the other's menu without you having to sweitch characters
[1:07:24] <+TeethMuncher> smooth brain syndrome

[1:08:48] <Verriand> unf, jessie
[1:08:50] <ZComiX> He asked Cloud his age, and Cloud gave an Robo Response of "Uhhh soilder first class" before blushing at his lack of social skills
[1:08:51] <King_thunder365> "For the last time Marlene, no. Tifa is not your mother!"
[1:08:52] <cardboardboots> berrett isnt worried that the man he hired to kill people cant remember his age
[1:08:54] <AntChodeny> oh shit I just remember Barrets backstory
[1:08:54] <$RC_S3kshun8> Hey Eli, how are you liking it so far?

[1:09:57] <Highwang> more like the dethstream lol
[1:09:58] <Explodincatz> magma
[1:09:58] <Solidus_113> Smells like magic
[1:10:02] <Mr_Strut> It's called oil
[1:10:03] <Darikethe> Isn't that what Lava is?
[1:10:05] <+not_crabby> id try to drink it
[1:10:07] <+Kriptin> Oil
[1:10:09] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I mean I wouldnt be psyched about it
[1:10:10] <Maids4lyfe> what does it taste like
[1:10:11] <Triblade1992> It's called Oil
[1:10:11] <jacewolf_is_the_best> summon captain planet
[1:10:12] <+Jinandguice> Magma?
[1:10:14] <voltvexen> indeed it is oil
[1:10:15] <ToeBeanHeaven> Nukes confirmed to be Weapons from the Planet.
[1:10:17] <doggieo> Lava is basically blood
[1:10:19] <LunarRemix> That's just Oil.
[1:10:19] <+not_crabby> oil is dinosaur blood
[1:10:21] <$WoRabbit> oil is crushed up Dino, not planet blood
[1:10:22] <laserbeaming> Lava is pretty much Planet Blood I guess
[1:10:23] <TheAsylumCat> its bluud!
[1:10:23] <+not_crabby> not planet blood
[1:10:23] <zk_nails> I thought that was Mountain Dew was
[1:10:24] <Explodincatz> Oil is more like zits
[1:10:24] <+AlastorSlain> in yo ass
[1:10:25] <+Jonesman64> what if... you pee on the life stream?
[1:10:28] <ToeBeanHeaven> VAPE THE MAKO, PLAGUE
[1:10:28] <+jiggy_snipe> oil comes from fossils
[1:10:29] <King_thunder365> I thought Mako was basically energy made from peoples' souls and/or ghosts
[1:10:29] <cap_bon> Imagine your one of NPC and every time you tell cloud to follow you he turns in the opposite direction to look for boxes
[1:10:29] <Maids4lyfe> I bet it's spearmint
[1:10:30] <+ahdurian> she'll get it stuck in Cloud's asscheeks
[1:10:32] <voltvexen> lava?
[1:10:38] <jacewolf_is_the_best> cocaine baby
[1:10:38] <AntChodeny> @Solidus_113 smells like dead souls
[1:10:41] <+Tr1pkT12> Earth has blood, oil and lava
[1:10:42] <CaptainFrankincense> look at all that juice!
[1:10:44] <AmaranthSparrow> Cars are way cooler when you realize they're powered by dead dinosaurs.
[1:10:45] <FrankishAxeman> Isn't that just chlorophyll?
[1:10:46] <KaironFortressKnight> slather it on some ribs
[1:10:52] <+TQuick101> is that 1 light flickering purposely?
[1:10:54] <TheAsylumCat> Jesse has nwf energy
[1:10:57] <Triblade1992> Barret was a living cartoon ini the original game
[1:11:01] <+ahdurian> Barret = Leon confirmed
[1:11:03] <wolfman_jack21> Incredible LUST for Eco-Terrorism
[1:11:12] <ToeBeanHeaven> "No thanks, BRO..."
[1:11:14] <Triblade1992> Moogle Medal
[1:11:16] <AmaranthSparrow> FFVII really does have some proto-survival horror game stuff going on.
[1:11:17] <Verriand> hurray, a new item
[1:11:19] <+FunkyRot> cloud got the downs
[1:11:20] <Triblade1992> KH3 incoming!
[1:11:28] <FrankishAxeman> Berret more like Barry
[1:11:30] <Kirbachev> It's great and I'm glad they followed through on him, rather than making him more milquetoast and palatable. He's always been anime Mr. T.
[1:11:31] <Burningskull01> collection side quest in main game incoming
[1:11:33] <jacewolf_is_the_best> 2d baby
[1:11:34] <laserbeaming> It's cute!

[1:12:15] <Verriand> the B
[1:12:18] <+RittiFruity> mind break
[1:12:20] <Kirbachev> Goddamn Jessie, hold it in girl LUL
[1:12:24] <voltvexen> goddamn horny as FUCK
[1:12:24] <studleydoorite> that wasn't suggestive, that was a command
[1:12:26] <King_thunder365> She's SPLOOSHING
[1:12:26] <jacewolf_is_the_best> wants that 1st class baby
[1:12:31] <AntChodeny> I'd drink her bathwater
[1:12:32] <+jiggy_snipe> just splooshing all over the place
[1:12:32] <Triblade1992> Motomu Toriyama and Nomura really loved that double meaning stuff in the original FF7
[1:12:32] <Highwang> Dieselpunk
[1:12:35] <+TQuick101> gawdy
[1:12:36] <AmaranthSparrow> Dieselpunk
[1:12:36] <laserbeaming> Dieselpunk
[1:12:37] <+ahdurian> evilpunk
[1:12:38] <Kirbachev> Like Dieselpunk, but green
[1:12:38] <dailylifewithry> Jessie be like “looking good JOKER”
[1:12:39] <wolfman_jack21> Dieselpunk, yep
[1:12:39] <KaironFortressKnight> GREEN
[1:12:40] <King_thunder365> Tech punk
[1:12:40] <Coystick> Dieselpunk
[1:12:41] <MrHappyFunshine> She thirsts for first class
[1:12:41] <Darikethe> Sorta the FF version of Shadowrun
[1:12:41] <+CoalSavoie> Dieselpunk
[1:12:42] <Murphio_GS> Grimy
[1:12:43] <MillaMoks> Magic punk
[1:12:44] <juxtest> Gimy industrial hell
[1:12:44] <ToeBeanHeaven> Smash her eggs, Plague.
[1:12:45] <+Jontman42> Dieselpunk
[1:12:46] <Darikethe> But only for Midgard
[1:12:48] <Triblade1992> Diieselpunk
[1:12:49] <%Samex_Comex> Akira like?
[1:12:49] <studleydoorite> Ponypunk
[1:12:51] <jacewolf_is_the_best> mako punk
[1:12:53] <Darikethe> the rest of the game is more traditional fantasy
[1:12:53] <dailylifewithry> Industrial Fantasy
[1:12:53] <TheAsylumCat> cloud I'm ovulating right now! cloud -nwf
[1:12:55] <Coystick> Dieselpunk with lasers
[1:12:56] <DandyMackeroos> Magipunk?
[1:12:57] <AmaranthSparrow> In the remake she doesn't get her foot stuck, she slips.
[1:12:59] <wolfman_jack21> Dieselpunk is the more grimy, oily variant
[1:13:02] <CaptainFrankincense> magitek
[1:13:02] <Animorphimagi> FuturePunk
[1:13:15] <+CoalSavoie> Although Dieselpunk usually depicts this kind of tech as a positive thing
[1:13:17] <$pennykettle_> Does the whole game look this depressing? never touched FF
[1:13:18] <King_thunder365> Future Love Sex Sounds
[1:13:33] <wolfman_jack21> Anime Dieselpunk is a STRONG aesthetic. That's the aesthetic of the first wave of Digimon, and that shit was cash.
[1:13:38] <TheAsylumCat> @pennykettle_ first half
[1:13:40] <Kirbachev> @pennykettle_ Mainly just Midgar. It's the big oppressive cityscape setting of the game.
[1:13:42] <Highwang> what's our whatever counter at?
[1:13:57] <$pennykettle_> gaspunk, a genre where the world became dependent on natural gasses
[1:14:06] <wolfman_jack21> Makopunk
[1:14:12] <KaironFortressKnight> Clouds counter only works on melee
[1:14:16] <Triblade1992> they were. They were just on the ground
[1:14:21] <Verriand> Feels like Cloud's hair is smaller then what it would have been
[1:14:37] <jacewolf_is_the_best> No barret. I'm not that high
[1:14:41] <+jiggy_snipe> this banter
[1:14:51] <wolfman_jack21> I feel like Mako would just melt you
[1:14:54] <Solidus_113> yes
[1:14:56] <+thackattack00> yes
[1:14:56] <cap_bon> barret wants to fuck the core
[1:15:00] <+CoalSavoie> I guess the Nibelheim pump was broke
[1:15:01] <Highwang> woah they got the eyeball plants what?
[1:15:06] <laserbeaming> You get to have a shared mako dream about your identity
[1:15:08] <+thackattack00> ATB doesn't carry between battles
[1:15:14] <Solidus_113> the game wants you to abuse ATB skills
[1:15:17] <Solidus_113> BOOOOOOOOOO
[1:15:17] <Kirbachev> LUL
[1:15:17] <+TQuick101> BARRET
[1:15:17] <Highwang> oh my god Barret
[1:15:18] <Johnmaddened> LUL

[1:15:21] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[1:15:22] <matouci> LUL
[1:15:22] <jacewolf_is_the_best> please remove that game
[1:15:23] <ToeBeanHeaven> No
[1:15:23] <Firststrike_OW> LUL
[1:15:23] <+ahdurian> YOU DONT MAKE SENSE SHUT UP
[1:15:24] <Coystick> Neeeeeerd
[1:15:24] <pureotome> LUL
[1:15:24] <Triblade1992> Prompto syndrome came out
[1:15:25] <+Bobert213> YES!
[1:15:25] <+arfafax> LUL
[1:15:26] <karl_rex> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:15:26] <ToeBeanHeaven> That's a YUFFIE thing
[1:15:26] <KellBeII> breaking the 4th wall
[1:15:28] <+CoalSavoie> I love it
[1:15:28] <Verriand> hmmmm
[1:15:28] <+RittiFruity> LUL
[1:15:31] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Barret invented that music
[1:15:31] <+not_crabby> he leveled up
[1:15:33] <wolfman_jack21> The song was in Barrett's mind! New canon!
[1:15:34] <ToeBeanHeaven> GODDAMNIT
[1:15:34] <supersugoisenpai1> Thanks Barret
[1:15:34] <snowmanse> Barret hears voices.
[1:15:35] <cerazor01> Shut up Plague. That's great! LUL LUL
[1:15:36] <+CoalSavoie> You never invented your own theme song?
[1:15:36] <Highwang> should be his Cell Phone ala the movie
[1:15:38] <xiccy> don't worry about it
[1:15:40] <+TheSaintJohn> Barret made the theme: confirmed
[1:15:42] <+CharredChord> is he imitating it?
[1:15:42] <pureotome> he never did that when i played
[1:15:46] <johnnybelmont_95> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:15:50] <AmaranthSparrow> Honestly it's just kind of generally industrial. Actually a hint of retro futurism and art deco with the 50s style vehicles.
[1:15:58] <AntChodeny> Kreygasm
[1:15:58] <wolfman_jack21> Damn, he THICK
[1:16:03] <Firststrike_OW> Kreygasm
[1:16:05] <numinouswastaken> dat ass KappaPride
[1:16:09] <DandyMackeroos> Oh yeh
[1:16:09] <Mr_Strut> wut
[1:16:09] <pureotome> Kreygasm
[1:16:11] <Burningskull01> i've heard this demo is from like november but some people got to play a more completed version a few weeks ago.
[1:16:11] <jacewolf_is_the_best> nothing here but these sweaty balls baby
[1:16:12] <Coystick> i love those gems
[1:16:13] <Johnmaddened> vargNut
[1:16:13] <+jiggy_snipe> what
[1:16:14] <FrankishAxeman> Berret needs serious help
[1:16:17] <Highwang> Gem in a butthole just means they have a buttplug
[1:16:18] <Solidus_113> you can hold run for faster ladder ascending/descending
[1:16:19] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes This is what happened in FF15 with Prompto where he flat out sang the victory song too. It was like 'the FUCK?'
[1:16:20] <Highwang> so you're still reminded
[1:16:24] <DandyMackeroos> Barret you jes full of surprises
[1:16:31] <jacewolf_is_the_best> planet goo
[1:16:31] <Andele1503> >gems, GEMS >not buttplug covers
[1:16:38] <lordofludo> Lokkit all that life juice
[1:16:40] <FrankishAxeman> He's hearing things
[1:16:40] <$RC_S3kshun8> What's the story for why Barrett has a gattling for an arm?
[1:16:43] <Darikethe> Has the texture of jello that hasn't set
[1:16:44] <$pennykettle_> ...ass gems?
[1:16:47] <zanzibarian_hamster> What would planet blood taste like?
[1:16:59] <Coystick> Salty milk coins
[1:17:00] <dailylifewithry> @rc_s3kshun8 Dass biggggggg story spoilers
[1:17:01] <wolfman_jack21> @zanzibarian_hamster Mercury, but refreshing.
[1:17:02] <laserbeaming> @Andele1503 oh... is that what he meant? Send Plague a fancy Buttplug
[1:17:02] <$pennykettle_> its passable
[1:17:03] <AmaranthSparrow> There's a timeline for the series in the International edition bonus disc.
[1:17:11] <AntChodeny> you can tell it's just ghost jizz
[1:17:15] <Mr_Strut> Mako is just fantasy oil
[1:17:15] <+Jonesman64> not really great looking "water"
[1:17:22] <snowmanse> I mean... they make materia out of it, they have to know it's magical somehow.
[1:17:27] <AmaranthSparrow> Er, not the series, but the game. It has a full timeline going back a thousand years.
[1:17:28] <Daxalog> Did they ever go into why some people have super human (by our standards) strength and durability? Cause I want to know.
[1:17:38] <jacewolf_is_the_best> law of conservation
[1:17:41] <+hobo13> what does it taste like
[1:17:43] <DandyMackeroos> Spooky ghost energy
[1:17:43] <+WerewolfoftheAncientland> @PlagueOfGripes Isn't that what we do with oil?
[1:17:51] <+not_crabby> LUL
[1:17:52] <RothurThePaladin> LUL
[1:17:57] <laserbeaming> LUL
[1:18:03] <Triblade1992> LUL
[1:18:08] <DandyMackeroos> Oil is made of previously living things
[1:18:11] <wolfman_jack21> @snowmanse I suppose you could liken it to burning coal, where processing and refining a material doesn't mean you necessarily understand WHY it burns, and so on.
[1:18:11] <AmaranthSparrow> I wonder if it smells bad.
[1:18:19] <+PleasantLee> Plague "Shinra did nothing wrong" Gripes
[1:18:20] <Pappajimbo> acceptable terrorism
[1:18:22] <jacewolf_is_the_best> people want their tv and vrrrm machines
[1:18:23] <AmaranthSparrow> That room must reek of the smell of mako, whatever it smells like.
[1:18:30] <jacewolf_is_the_best> souls be damned
[1:18:37] <wolfman_jack21> I feel like the room smells like metal and ozone.
[1:18:38] <AmaranthSparrow> Probably smells like farts. Ghost farts.
[1:18:40] <wolfman_jack21> Like a thundestorm.
[1:18:52] <DandyMackeroos> Shinea is just a bunch of world conquering capitalists, I think...
[1:18:57] <Highwang> Stamp?
[1:19:02] <dailylifewithry> I think it might be a thing where mako does regenerate eventually after being used as energy, but the rate at which humans are using it is depleting it’s short-term usability, and state of the planet and life
[1:19:06] <jacewolf_is_the_best> blow dis sucka up
[1:19:07] <AmaranthSparrow> The Shinra mascot dog.
[1:19:22] <RahnalH102> pouty Cloud
[1:19:27] <wolfman_jack21> @dailylifewithry Yeah, if deaths add to the Lifestream, then it must replenish - just not fast enough
[1:19:33] <Verriand> "Do it so I canw atch you, to see you dont screw us over"
[1:19:34] <Darikethe> Holy shit does Cloud have the Echo?
[1:19:36] <Coystick> Pouty with a chance of huff
[1:19:36] <Triblade1992> Sephiroth is here
[1:19:41] <$pennykettle_> dodedamjwb
[1:19:45] <AmaranthSparrow> Cloud has the Shining.
[1:19:53] <Highwang> 20 minutes. Nut up
[1:19:54] <DandyMackeroos> Makes sense
[1:19:58] <+PleasantLee> DONT BE A PUSSY!
[1:19:58] <Triblade1992> Cloud seeing a one winged angel
[1:19:59] <Mr_Strut> 10 minuts
[1:20:00] <HoroHoroKororo> ooohhh interesting
[1:20:00] <+FunkyRot> theres none
[1:20:00] <+Mekhet09> NUT UP
[1:20:00] <sosuke5> 10 minutes
[1:20:00] <wolfman_jack21> 10 minutes
[1:20:01] <+arfafax> 10 minutes
[1:20:02] <superbla25> difference is ten minutes
[1:20:02] <MESeele> 20m run faster
[1:20:02] <+HypotheticalWalrus> One makes you a coward
[1:20:05] <+jiggy_snipe> he says different things
[1:20:06] <AmaranthSparrow> 20 minutes for a secret ending.
[1:20:07] <Sedrelic> 10 minutes
[1:20:07] <+FunkyRot> DO 20
[1:20:07] <Kirbachev> the difference is 10 minutes, jeez
[1:20:07] <+ahdurian> 10 minutes
[1:20:08] <AntChodeny> he calls you a coward if you choose 30
[1:20:09] <KellBeII> give people more time to escape
[1:20:09] <Burningskull01> in the demo there isn't one
[1:20:13] <+ahdurian> no 10 minutes is the difference
[1:20:14] <ToeBeanHeaven> 20 minutes or no balls.
[1:20:15] <KaironFortressKnight> you get an extra scene at 20 but its minor
[1:20:15] <Johnmaddened> 2 minutes :)
[1:20:16] <+PleasantLee> set it off now
[1:20:16] <jacewolf_is_the_best> they are saying the difference
[1:20:17] <+PleasantLee> to make sure
[1:20:18] <Triblade1992> 20 minutes gets more stuff
[1:20:19] <Mr_Strut> The difference is 10 minutes
[1:20:19] <King_thunder365> FIVE MINUTES
[1:20:21] <juxtest> Barret's social link will go up more
[1:20:23] <+FunkyRot> DO 5
[1:20:23] <wolfman_jack21> It's precisely a 10 minute difference
[1:20:27] <+FunkyRot> do five mins
[1:20:28] <zk_nails> thats the difference, Plague Kappa
[1:20:29] <Burningskull01> except what Barrett says to you after you set the timer
[1:20:29] <Solidus_113> Barret calls you a coward for making it 30 minutes
[1:20:31] <Daxalog> 30-20 = Difference of 10 Smug face
[1:20:33] <AntChodeny> 20 minutes for big dick energy
[1:20:46] <Rodzzila> "I don't trust you, so ahead and arm the bomb" Yep, make sense
[1:20:47] <Coystick> Gaaaaamer
[1:20:48] <studleydoorite> we've all seen it
[1:20:49] <supersugoisenpai1> 20 minutes is more than generous, you also get an extra scene
[1:20:51] <dailylifewithry> Cloud would totally be cocky right now and choose the short answer
[1:20:51] <HoroHoroKororo> gotta prove that gamer cred
[1:20:52] <ToeBeanHeaven> Plague caving into peer pressure
[1:20:52] <Highwang> 5 days would be a great way to establish an alibi
[1:20:52] <zk_nails> Plague, true gamer
[1:20:58] <DandyMackeroos> Fuking about is nice
[1:20:59] <xiccy> it's very big
[1:21:00] <Coystick> Barret wears MANY belts
[1:21:01] <wolfman_jack21> "Got a big COCK, don'tcha?"
[1:21:02] <Verriand> "Really looking to kill us huh? Nice"
[1:21:02] <dailylifewithry> GAMER
[1:21:02] <AmaranthSparrow> "We need to prove how big our e-penis is." "Pretty cocky."
[1:21:08] <juxtest> Guess who
[1:21:11] <cardboardboots> 20 was the origional time right?
[1:21:12] <jacewolf_is_the_best> wack it
[1:21:15] <jacewolf_is_the_best> bop it
[1:21:17] <studleydoorite> why does he immediately think he's been crossed when he hears -a- noise
[1:21:17] <+Jonesman64> new from apple: the ePeen
[1:21:19] <Mr_Strut> Hit it really hard
[1:21:21] <+not_crabby> shock t6he fuck outof it
[1:21:23] <zanzibarian_hamster> ATTACK WHILE ITS TAIL IS UP
[1:21:32] <+arfafax> Original time was 10 mins
[1:21:35] <AntChodeny> @cardboardboots yes
[1:21:39] <+thackattack00> This thing kicked my ass when I played the demo
[1:21:39] <DandyMackeroos> Oh boy, scorpion fella. Better attack when it’s tail is up
[1:21:52] <Highwang> oh no the tiny arm grabbed me!
[1:22:01] <Verriand> Attack when it's tail is up! -And it will counter attack
[1:22:16] <gordieda20> LUL
[1:22:17] <+HypotheticalWalrus> Barrets such an asshole i love it
[1:22:20] <Highwang> YEAH YOU SEE THAT BIG NUMBER?
[1:22:23] <Coystick> No damage
[1:22:26] <Highwang> highwa1BIGNMBR
[1:22:37] <RahnalH102> you can get interrupted
[1:22:39] <+jiggy_snipe> you can be interrupted
[1:22:44] <jacewolf_is_the_best> unlimited ammo
[1:22:54] <+not_crabby> cloud gonna die
[1:22:56] <Triblade1992> Plague, Cloud is dying
[1:22:59] <AmaranthSparrow> When augmented reality comes out I want it to show damage numbers whenever you hit something.
[1:23:04] <DandyMackeroos> Where does all the ammo from Barret’s gun come from?
[1:23:10] <Solidus_113> triggers to command cloud
[1:23:23] <Verriand> Barret is like Dante. Blood ammo
[1:23:28] <studleydoorite> I have functionally infinite pp
[1:23:30] <Verriand> or wait, not Dante, fuck
[1:23:30] <Coystick> Meanwhile Jessie is just fapping up a storm from the balcony
[1:23:30] <wolfman_jack21> @DandyMackeroos An Ammo Materia in his elbow, duh
[1:23:44] <DandyMackeroos> @wolfman_jack21 Oh I see, so magic.
[1:23:54] <jacewolf_is_the_best> man she gonna have so much porn of her
[1:23:57] <+PleasantLee> I wouldnt be surprised if this demo has different recovery rates for battle mechanics
[1:24:08] <wolfman_jack21> @DandyMackeroos Given the evil crab robot, I'm willing to bet even the guns are functionally magic, yeah.
[1:24:24] <AmaranthSparrow> Shoot it in the butthole.
[1:24:29] <DandyMackeroos> Gun magic sounds pretty radical
[1:24:33] <cosmeleon> soulja boy
[1:24:35] <ToeBeanHeaven> SOULJABOI
[1:24:38] <ToeBeanHeaven> YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[1:24:40] <Solidus_113> grenades are pretty good
[1:24:46] <+not_crabby> literally in the asshole
[1:24:47] <SuperVaderMan> poke its butt until the shield turns off LUL
[1:24:48] <xxshadowxx416> 8n his ass
[1:24:51] <AmaranthSparrow> @DandyMackeroos You would love Final Fantasy Unlimited.
[1:25:04] <wolfman_jack21> @DandyMackeroos In the SMT games, Gun is its own element, so your Demons literally learn Gun-type spells. It's silly as hell.
[1:25:10] <AmaranthSparrow> It has a guy who shoots espers out of his gun.
[1:25:35] <AmaranthSparrow> And his Bahamut is a giant gun dragon.
[1:25:42] <DandyMackeroos> @wolfman_jack21 Persona follows similar rules, so yeah it’s pretty silly
[1:25:43] <Deimos002> Ah yes, the ancient forbidden magic: Gun
[1:25:57] <DandyMackeroos> @amaranthsparrow For real
[1:26:07] <Valfar45> what an ominous symbol
[1:26:17] <tacostarvedbeast> Why do I want a butterfinger now?
[1:26:21] <AmaranthSparrow> Yeah, it's an early 2000s anime. Actually pretty bad, but has some pretty interesting animation.
[1:26:22] <xxshadowxx416> kingdom hearts
[1:26:33] <jacewolf_is_the_best> is light
[1:26:35] <dailylifewithry> @toebeanheaven CRANK THAT
[1:26:35] <Triblade1992> Kingdom Hearts + FF13 combat
[1:26:35] <Solidus_113> you can just use the triggers to command your party to use skills, you don't need to switch to them
[1:26:48] <wolfman_jack21> @DandyMackeroos Exactly. In SMT it gets even dumber; one of the highest damage Gun spells, that shows up in most of the games, is called Riot Gun. The implication being that your Demon mows someone down with an AA-12 or something.
[1:27:11] <UncleRuckus99> why did Sephiroth stay indoors? Because there was too many Clouds outside
[1:27:22] <DandyMackeroos> @wolfman_jack21 That sounds pretty hilarious
[1:27:33] <+TQuick101> magic
[1:27:47] <johnnybelmont_95> Look at this monster hunter game
[1:27:54] <Darikethe> To me it seems like the instinct is to treat it like Monster Hunter, but without the combos or battle flow
[1:27:54] <xxshadowxx416> pat playing bye
[1:28:02] <+PleasantLee> I wish I had a giant tv and good sound system to play this on
[1:28:03] <Darikethe> so it's like you gotta be methodical here
[1:28:04] <laserbeaming> You would make more damage if you used your ATB as soon as you get it I think?
[1:28:06] <superbla25> combat is kinda awkward
[1:28:17] <wolfman_jack21> @DandyMackeroos Yeah, the SMT games are so grim and serious that any tonal dissonance feels silly as hell. You can play most of them on emulators, too, so if you liked the Persona games, try playing SMT IV. You'll like it a lot.
[1:28:17] <+jiggy_snipe> it's like FF15 x FF13
[1:28:19] <AmaranthSparrow> It's easier when you use your ATB
[1:28:20] <MESeele> Riot Gun in smt is a localized translation of Freikugel-- the bullets given by the devil
[1:28:35] <dailylifewithry> What is Tifa’s j-pop idol name? Queen LaTifa
[1:28:38] <Coystick> I haven't played a Final Fantasy since 8 so it's all new to me.
[1:28:41] <DandyMackeroos> @meseele That’s pretty metal
[1:28:47] <Triblade1992> @jiggy_snipe Morel like FF13 x KH combat. Since it's Nomura and Motomu Toriyama co directing
[1:28:50] <Solidus_113> you still have potions and ethers
[1:29:13] <+PleasantLee> hit it in the robot anus
[1:29:13] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Oh, so they localize that, but Megidolaon - which is a vague reference to a mountain from the Bible - just gets to rock forever? Translation decisions, man.
[1:29:24] <+not_crabby> the camera is really fucked in this game
[1:29:32] <MESeele> I know, localization is weird sometimes
[1:29:35] <AmaranthSparrow> You can adjust the camera settings pretty freely
[1:29:47] <+jiggy_snipe> @Triblade1992 yea more KH1 than the future ones I think
[1:29:52] <chhdez> ♪
[1:29:58] <Coystick> These fully 3D polygonal final fantasies you youngsters rummage around it frighten me.
[1:30:04] <+Mekhet09> It's almost like not using the MAGIC that is supposed to be use to makes it more annoying.
[1:30:18] <+yoshi_754> @Mekhet09 lol
[1:30:19] <Coystick> Back in my day backgrounds were pre-rendered and that's the way we liked it!
[1:30:24] <+jiggy_snipe> so isn't it weird how much damage the scorpion does the reactor lol
[1:30:26] <+TQuick101> slow-ass barret
[1:30:34] <Triblade1992> you kind of dicked around there Plague. That was more your fault
[1:30:35] <DandyMackeroos> Ruh roh
[1:30:39] <chhdez> If you feel like you're about to die, don't
[1:30:43] <johnnybelmont_95> Guard the reactor by blowing it up
[1:30:51] <Elroux_> that was kinda your fault tbh
[1:30:54] <AmaranthSparrow> Use your abilities and spells dude. :/
[1:30:56] <Cyral_Drive> Is this hardmode?
[1:30:58] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Amen. They changed True Lobotomy to Fatal Sword when they revamped Strange Journey over to Strange Journey Redux, and it's like the biggest downgrade a name for an attack has ever had. Mortal Jihad became Flurry of Blows or something too, just huge losses.
[1:31:02] <HoroHoroKororo> can you jump over his lightning aoe?
[1:31:10] <Solidus_113> there's no free jump
[1:31:10] <dailylifewithry> @chhdez You’re gonna die? Yeah just don’t do that
[1:31:18] <HoroHoroKororo> bummer
[1:31:40] <+SleeplessRhythme> you should use more abilities
[1:31:46] <DandyMackeroos> @dailylifewithry Dying is for losers anyways
[1:31:46] <MESeele> Strange Journey Redux had more content, but felt like a step back in so many ways
[1:31:51] <+Parlsain> Barret had his limit break, didn't it say?
[1:32:00] <Solidus_113> he does
[1:32:05] <johnnybelmont_95> Fantasy souls
[1:32:08] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Once more, amen. Did like the New Chaos ending a lot in theory, tho.
[1:32:11] <+not_crabby> barret has a limit break
[1:32:12] <chhdez> @dailylifewithry Just hold those thoughts
[1:32:20] <Solidus_113> gotta get used to looking at the meters at the right
[1:32:32] <MESeele> Atlus needs to lay off the rerelease waifus
[1:32:37] <+skiassassin> @plagueofgripes Hi PLAGUE, how has your day been?
[1:32:39] <+jiggy_snipe> Big Shot
[1:32:40] <Ictiam> Thunder count: 1
[1:32:42] <+Genericmistake> anyone else dropping frames like mad?
[1:32:44] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele It
[1:33:01] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele It definitely always happens to include a new QT, yeah.
[1:33:07] <+skiassassin> I hope it has been good
[1:33:16] <Burningskull01> they really could make the limit gauge flash rainbow colors like in the original when it's full
[1:33:26] <AmaranthSparrow> @Burningskull01 It does...
[1:33:35] <dailylifewithry> @chhdez https://youtu.be/KR-OtYjWLB4 Sums it up pretty nicely
[1:33:38] <Burningskull01> looked like it was just flashing yellow
[1:33:39] <MESeele> Funny enough, the only rerelease waifu I liked was feMC from P3P
[1:33:48] <+yoshi_754> focus on exhausting him
[1:33:50] <wolfman_jack21> This bossfight, uh, taking a minute.
[1:34:02] <Solidus_113> staggers are important
[1:34:09] <Solidus_113> you have ethers
[1:34:15] <AmaranthSparrow> @wolfman_jack21 He hasn't really been using his abilities, that's why.
[1:34:21] <+garbocardboardington> Never once have I played a final fantasy game, but this looks hype AF
[1:34:24] <MESeele> Plague wants a no magic win I guess
[1:34:37] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Alex was especially questionable, because like, you either kill her or make her not exist. No matter what.
[1:34:37] <+Jonesman64> was kind of hoping would regen a little bit on its own...
[1:34:43] <+yoshi_754> exhaust him
[1:34:47] <johnnybelmont_95> You know the small talk during combat is cool but I can tell it’s gonna get old real fast
[1:34:48] <wolfman_jack21> @AmaranthSparrow Yeah, I figured.
[1:34:50] <AmaranthSparrow> Abilities are your main source of damage in this game, the melee/ranged combat is just to fill the aTB gauge.
[1:34:54] <+Genericmistake> @wolfman_jack21 I have only been watching for a few minutes and he seems to be hardly using ATBs which seems to be where most of your damage comes from. I
[1:35:02] <+PleasantLee> its not easy being a lifeless automaton with no room to grow as a person. maybe get a new job, buy a boat
[1:35:08] <ALTRNico> he's getting tired of that shit
[1:35:09] <+jiggy_snipe> I love how Barret is tired of this LUL
[1:35:11] <Coystick> I like his glove sleeve thing running up his robot arm, sells it.
[1:35:13] <Kirbachev> Barret's fed up with this, and I don't blame him
[1:35:29] <+yoshi_754> @Genericmistake pretty much, and Barret has the one where you can increase the exhaust meter
[1:35:35] <+yoshi_754> stagger sorry
[1:35:49] <wolfman_jack21> @Genericmistake Yeah, and I figured it would be that way. Reminds me of KH, where your spells were way more potent than melee attacks but were, of course, locked behind MP.
[1:35:56] <Solidus_113> Cloud has Fire magic
[1:35:57] <cerazor01> Cloud is SWORD man
[1:35:58] <MESeele> @wolfman_jack21 lol yeah. Alex took away so much atmosphere, and had no purpose. Like PQ games always being a dream
[1:36:03] <cerazor01> not GUNSWORD man
[1:36:27] <+Genericmistake> @wolfman_jack21 it seems that auto attacks are probably only about 10-20% of your damage
[1:36:51] <+jiggy_snipe> you can change bindings I think
[1:36:56] <Coystick> Just button bash the button basher
[1:37:29] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele I think Alex's big problem is that she had to, like, give the obvious argument that makes your Law/Chaos bro make a rational choice instead of being crazy. The angle of Lucifer's time-travelling daughter is very cool, but she was so underdeveloped, even for Strange Journey, a very characterization-light SMT game.
[1:37:36] <Solidus_113> just use the triggers to command allies
[1:37:53] <wolfman_jack21> @Genericmistake I'm getting that exact feeling.
[1:37:53] <AmaranthSparrow> You can set the abilities to shortcuts also
[1:38:01] <Explodincatz> yay u did it
[1:38:10] <AmaranthSparrow> So you can use them freely in combat without the menu.
[1:38:26] <Burningskull01> you should try Classic mode Plague
[1:38:30] <Burningskull01> it was pretty fun
[1:38:35] <johnnybelmont_95> Nightmare slain
[1:38:39] <Triblade1992> during
[1:38:44] <RahnalH102> Yeah give CLassic mdoe a try
[1:38:44] <HoroHoroKororo> probably for the better
[1:38:49] <ALTRNico> I mean considering that you also have to pay attention to the meters
[1:38:50] <MESeele> @wolfman_jack21 agreed. Lucifer daughter was cool in the other one... Can't remember the name off the top of my head. Old game though.
[1:38:53] <Solidus_113> Easy-only Classic mode woolieMIRIN
[1:38:57] <+not_crabby> take this time to heal
[1:38:59] <jacewolf_is_the_best> where baby girl at
[1:39:01] <chhdez> Classic Wdgie
[1:39:01] <+not_crabby> Kappa
[1:39:07] <AmaranthSparrow> Only thing about Classic Mode is it also defaults to Easy, so the enemies die really fast.
[1:39:24] <AmaranthSparrow> Although I think time to kill for easy mode is also pretty satisfying to be honest.
[1:39:27] <+Genericmistake> It might actually be playable to me now LUL. Even as a kid I get board of combat systems in straight turn based RPGs. Almost no game there . Though I love SRPGs.
[1:39:27] <Cyral_Drive> ditched
[1:39:32] <RahnalH102> He gone
[1:39:38] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele I'll give SMT IV this, it's a hard upgrade in almost all areas Strange Journey was lacking. SMT V's got a lot to live up to.
[1:39:42] <MESeele> One of the big reasons I don't want Atlus trying to make a smt3 remake. You know plot important waifus are incoming
[1:39:43] <zindilly> hold R1 to slide down ladders and go up them bery slighly faster
[1:39:46] <jacewolf_is_the_best> baby girl nooooo
[1:39:47] <Solidus_113> using sprint is slightly faster
[1:39:52] <+PleasantLee> SAVE JESSE
[1:39:59] <+PleasantLee> best girl
[1:40:04] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Featuring Hatsune Miko from the Annoying Robot Music series.
[1:40:09] <+jiggy_snipe> gotta help Jesse
[1:40:10] <MESeele> lol
[1:40:15] <Quinnotetiquan> i bet they will have cast time reduction skills or maybe armor when using skills
[1:40:23] <Burningskull01> in the original if you try to run past Jessie she hollers at you and you have to talk to her.
[1:40:23] <jacewolf_is_the_best> she's the one
[1:40:27] <ALTRNico> that's the same dialogue she uses in the original
[1:40:52] <MESeele> smt5 better not follow smt4a...... so... dissapointing. So very, not smt
[1:40:54] <KellBeII> moogle medal
[1:40:59] <jacewolf_is_the_best> yeah, look up
[1:41:15] <MillaMoks> The game does have temp party members you cannot control. His name is red xiii
[1:41:20] <jacewolf_is_the_best> ooooo soft
[1:41:36] <Meowbringer> firmly grasp it.
[1:41:52] <ToeBeanHeaven> Souljaboiiiiii
[1:41:57] <jacewolf_is_the_best> murder time

[1:42:00] <ALTRNico> wammy u
[1:42:00] <+illoonar> LUL
[1:42:05] <doggieo> Tell em!!
[1:42:08] <jacewolf_is_the_best> that man had a family
[1:42:28] <+not_crabby> not anymore
[1:42:30] <MESeele> But 4a did have improved mechanics...at least
[1:42:31] <+PleasantLee> he and his family will be one in the planet
[1:42:36] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele Apocalypse had great presentation, a lot of new art that I didn't like design-wise as much as Kaneko's work, and a really weak story. Thank god the intro states it's an alternate timeline, not the canon events after SMT IV.
[1:42:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:42:40] <jacewolf_is_the_best> not if they suck up his mako
[1:43:24] <wolfman_jack21> I'm so excited to fight Hell House
[1:43:34] <+TQuick101> yes
[1:43:38] <MESeele> @wolfman_jack21 yup. No atmosphere, ehh story, really nice wrapping
[1:43:44] <Explodincatz> mental stance switching
[1:43:48] <Explodincatz> as i call it
[1:43:51] <Cyral_Drive> No because I am pro elite gamer
[1:43:54] <Burningskull01> i hope that in the main game blocking and doging will cancel your attack animations better.
[1:44:17] <AmaranthSparrow> Did Barret just say "I'll make your eyeballs pop, HOOH!" ???
[1:44:28] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele And Dagda's English VA barely had an accent. Lad, why would you give us an Irish wisdom god and barely give him a brogue? I wanna hear those r's roll gratuitously.
[1:44:36] <jacewolf_is_the_best> bang bang
[1:44:47] <MESeele> @wolfman_jack21 I'd be happier if they announced a new Devil Survivor or Raidou. I look forward to smt5, but theres a lot of red flags lately
[1:45:11] <jacewolf_is_the_best> hope Cid is an absolute beast
[1:45:34] <jacewolf_is_the_best> special ability: tea time
[1:45:34] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele We can dream. A new Raidou game seems so far away. Hell, a Digital Devil Saga remake might be cool too, a lotta people never touched those.
[1:45:41] <+Mekhet09> Why don't you use fire on cloud?
[1:46:03] <+PleasantLee> and also despite it being a demo that'll end soon
[1:46:10] <Triblade1992> you can miss attack plague
[1:46:24] <wolfman_jack21> Cloud's sword is made of sparks.
[1:46:30] <+not_crabby> man the stream kinda dying
[1:46:31] <+jiggy_snipe> yea positioning matters
[1:46:47] <Solidus_113> Buster Sword built with flint
[1:46:52] <MESeele> DDS was super fun. On the raidou note, I admit I'm looking forward to P5scramble
[1:47:06] <Burningskull01> "can you imagine of those lasers were still up" just wait plague
[1:47:14] <Triblade1992> No Cloud, "Whatever" is what Squall says
[1:47:38] <+doctor_piranha> What're your thoughts on it so far Plague?
[1:47:38] <+PleasantLee> Cloud said it first
[1:47:39] <wolfman_jack21> @MESeele No shame in wanting an SMT action game. But yeah, a new Devil Survivor would also be great, it was a nice remix on the same traditional SMT ideas.
[1:48:16] <MESeele> yup yup
[1:48:24] <wolfman_jack21> I want to see a blast wave kill the party if you take too much time. I want to feel the fuck-up.
[1:48:51] <MESeele> Does that happen in the original? I never waited around that long
[1:49:07] <wolfman_jack21> Nor have I, actually.
[1:49:32] <wolfman_jack21> The turrets reproduce like rabbits.
[1:49:45] <RahnalH102> "big bang"
[1:49:58] <+jiggy_snipe> falseflag lol
[1:49:59] <+not_crabby> smert phern
[1:50:02] <+arfafax> Shina did 9/11? fhaeThink
[1:50:03] <+illoonar> whooo smartphones
[1:50:10] <Solidus_113> inside job
[1:50:13] <AmaranthSparrow> Avalanches can't melt steel beams
[1:50:18] <Triblade1992> conspiracy to make it so that Shinra look like the good guys
[1:50:22] <studleydoorite> he had a macro that made the robots go nuts?
[1:50:24] <LunarRemix> I'd be embarassing if it were terrorists.
[1:50:28] <LunarRemix> It*
[1:50:29] <Cyral_Drive> sleep
[1:50:31] <+PleasantLee> this could be false flagging with ALOT of evidence to prove its real
[1:50:33] <wolfman_jack21> "You didn't win!"
[1:50:42] <jacewolf_is_the_best> baby girl
[1:50:45] <MillaMoks> This should be the first
[1:50:52] <tanarath> plague, 1st reactor
[1:50:55] <cerazor01> Shinra knows Avalanche, because in the phone game iirc they blew up a reactor
[1:50:55] <wolfman_jack21> I think this is SOLELY to remove some of the guilt from your team literally being terrorists.
[1:51:02] <Solidus_113> It was mentioned there was an attempt on Shinra's life earlier
[1:51:15] <Triblade1992> I guess "one little bomb blowing up a reactor" was considered too unrealistiic
[1:51:15] <+SinOmenRoll> its for the insurance money
[1:51:32] <+jiggy_snipe> SPLOOSH
[1:51:36] <+PleasantLee> I love Jessie
[1:51:38] <ToeBeanHeaven> MMMM
[1:51:41] <ToeBeanHeaven> MUH EGGS
[1:51:43] <+not_crabby> aw cloud is kind of a cutie
[1:51:44] <+213372bu> I think Barret did something with the Turks regarding a reactor
[1:51:44] <+ahdurian> yeah he has some Levis
[1:51:45] <ToeBeanHeaven> JUST ONE DROP CLOUD
[1:51:49] <Triblade1992> Plague, this isn't the Redfiield family line
[1:51:56] <+RittiFruity> cooming
[1:52:00] <vonmaultke> LUL
[1:52:07] <lordofludo> Why would you speech such accursed words?
[1:52:08] <studleydoorite> so that's what it sounds like when a woman cums
[1:52:09] <karl_rex> Whoops there goes a hospital or something
[1:52:14] <ToeBeanHeaven> And on that day, the air around midgar got a little saltier
[1:52:22] <jacewolf_is_the_best> fuck all other girls. Only need Jessie
[1:52:30] <+213372bu> the compressed audio on this part si so weird
[1:52:42] <wolfman_jack21> Oh yeah, the audio is really bad.
[1:52:43] <wolfman_jack21> Woah.
[1:52:45] <chhdez> He's a hippie, shoot him!
[1:52:52] <+PleasantLee> precious flower
[1:53:03] <Triblade1992> Hi Sephiroth
[1:53:05] <+fingalights> Flower boy cloud
[1:53:08] <YakumoYomi> Gasp!
[1:53:09] <+HypotheticalWalrus> PogChamp Its that guy
[1:53:11] <+not_crabby> GAPS
[1:53:13] <Sedrelic> there he is
[1:53:17] <PinkCatHime> I know who that is! I clapped!
[1:53:19] <Solidus_113> BUY NOW
[1:53:22] <+illoonar> Sefrof?
[1:53:22] <HoroHoroKororo> Remember Griffith?
[1:53:25] <wolfman_jack21> He's protecting his virginity from legions of strapping soldier men
[1:53:25] <Triblade1992> BUY IT!
[1:53:26] <+jiggy_snipe> now buy it
[1:53:27] <RothurThePaladin> BUY 5!
[1:53:31] <MESeele> I hope Vincent's transformations don't suck this time
[1:53:31] <studleydoorite> choices matter PogChamp
[1:53:35] <YakumoYomi> CONSUME PRODUCT!
[1:53:36] <+jiggy_snipe> buy it piggie
[1:53:40] <+Arkanrais> there's probably a load of people who would flip their shit if there was no sephiroth in the first remake game
[1:53:40] <RothurThePaladin> they look so bad
[1:53:43] <AmaranthSparrow> Nice of them to default the cursor to the standard edition.
[1:53:46] <Triblade1992> Carbuncle has been working out in the library
[1:53:51] <+213372bu> Might be exclusive
[1:53:53] <deadrottenbird> consoom
[1:53:59] <$doomp12> remember that sephiroth conditions and as she his hair twice a day canonically
[1:53:59] <Triblade1992> Carbuncle has big brain energy
[1:54:05] <+213372bu> I think their materia is very bad though, something like 1 weak buff
[1:54:08] <+PleasantLee> not sure how I feel about Sephiroth being shown this early. I know we all know hes in it. and they know we all know that we know. but I would like it if it was presented like a new player is playing
[1:54:09] <+JamesCorck> Remember Star War-I mean Final Fantasyyyy!?!?!?!
[1:54:10] <+jiggy_snipe> yep
[1:54:13] <tanarath> But Plague, be hype! PRODUCT!
[1:54:13] <$doomp12> washes*
[1:54:14] <peachteagaming> was FF7 good?
[1:54:17] <Cyral_Drive> seff roff
[1:54:17] <+Mekhet09> Yeah.
[1:54:18] <+not_crabby> man when you started playing it differently at the end this stream became waaay more enjoyable
[1:54:19] <Burningskull01> you should try classic mode plague. might help you get better at the combat system
[1:54:22] <+JamesCorck> Don't ask questions!
[1:54:24] <YakumoYomi> I hate how Carbuncle and Choco Chick look in the remake.
[1:54:24] <+JamesCorck> Get excite!
[1:54:25] <wolfman_jack21> @doomp12 Dude must got through at least a gallon a week.
[1:54:27] <chhdez> How many swords does he have
[1:54:29] <RahnalH102> Thank you for riding FF7 Remake. Please make your way to the exit which is exclusively at the other end of this gift shop.
[1:54:38] <AmaranthSparrow> The first time you see him is playing as him, isn't it?
[1:54:48] <+jiggy_snipe> yea
[1:55:00] <Triblade1992> yeah but thanks to 23 years of content later that people already know who Sephiroth is at this poinit
[1:55:04] <+fingalights> Yeah, I'd like if seph wasn't in this part at all
[1:55:06] <AmaranthSparrow> Midgardsormr
[1:55:35] <chhdez> It's long haired Gohan blanco
[1:55:35] <+PleasantLee> I think its a fucked translation of jormungandr
[1:55:44] <MESeele> wait your turn
[1:55:53] <MESeele> Combat must be orderly
[1:56:03] <peachteagaming> kingdom hearts combat?
[1:56:05] <AmaranthSparrow> No, Midgardsormr. Midgar wurm.
[1:56:54] <MESeele> midgard is earth tho. So world serpent either way]
[1:56:59] <+PleasantLee> time for bed, night night
[1:57:08] <LunarRemix> Nope.
[1:57:12] <jacewolf_is_the_best> Jessie all the way
[1:57:12] <LunarRemix> Pretty rad.
[1:57:12] <+FunkyRot> its okay
[1:57:13] <+arfafax> Good
[1:57:13] <sosuke5> it was fine
[1:57:14] <Explodincatz> i never played this game before
[1:57:16] <+TQuick101> boss fight was a bit annoying
[1:57:18] <+jiggy_snipe> it's good
[1:57:19] <Triblade1992> I haven't. Look like FF13 x KH combat. Which is a good thinig.
[1:57:22] <+FunkyRot> its not as boring as ff15
[1:57:22] <+jiggy_snipe> boss is a little long
[1:57:28] <peachteagaming> stream Doom 3?
[1:57:29] <YakumoYomi> I'm committed to buying it now.
[1:57:32] <+arfafax> Characters are all hot. Good game.
[1:57:41] <MESeele> Barret's seems cool
[1:57:44] <RahnalH102> Watching people play, a lot of them seem to have similar issues wrapping their head around the combat system during the boss fight at least.
[1:57:46] <+fingalights> it's ok...
[1:57:49] <Quinnotetiquan> will probably be skills that prevent interupt or shorten cast time
[1:57:51] <+Arkanrais> I arrived in time to not see any gameplay, so that was some great timing
[1:57:52] <+CutsAknife> better than 15 combat. 15 was boring as hell. looked coll though
[1:57:53] <Burningskull01> better off never plyaing FFXV
[1:57:58] <Happy_Karl> Am I the one person who enjoyed 15?
[1:58:02] <+jiggy_snipe> 1 year latter I believe
[1:58:03] <Explodincatz> OH BOY a full year
[1:58:05] <+jiggy_snipe> later*
[1:58:06] <+FunkyRot> lets make plague mods for ff7r
[1:58:07] <+Arkanrais> april 10th 2021 is the end of exclusivity period
[1:58:18] <xiccy> @happy_karl no, I loved 15 too
[1:58:21] <CaptainFrankincense> better than ff15 is like saying better than a stubbed toe
[1:58:23] <Explodincatz> god damnit japan
[1:58:37] <Stillchr> @PlagueOfGripes Is it bad that i want it to be turn based, and no action gameplay
[1:58:38] <Triblade1992> I thought it was that Japanese people in general don't like working on PC stuff
[1:58:39] <deadrottenbird> ff15 port isnt that bad
[1:58:44] <+Mekhet09> The full game is like 100 gigs right?
[1:58:45] <peachteagaming> PS2 - 32mb of RAM
[1:58:48] <cyberblueneon> i agree, playing on pc sucks
[1:58:50] <+Mekhet09> I'm going to have to get it physically
[1:58:59] <+jiggy_snipe> it's weird cuz Nier came out on consoles and PC around the same time
[1:59:03] <chhdez> Delays because of COVID?
[1:59:05] <Triblade1992> FF15 was a more grounded KH combat
[1:59:07] <+not_crabby> 2020 not 21
[1:59:17] <MESeele> Nier so good
[1:59:19] <+Arkanrais> ff15 was a mess because it had its story completely gutted
[1:59:22] <Meowbringer> ff12 literally played itself :3
[1:59:27] <Triblade1992> April 2020 is comes out
[1:59:27] <zamzoph> all combat in FF15 is won through attrition
[1:59:51] <Burningskull01> in classic your characte moves and attacks on it's own so your atb fills as fast as normally
[1:59:55] <+Arkanrais> so much of ff15 ended up being "just polish this and push it out" after the 13 years of development hell
[1:59:56] <peachteagaming> ps1 texture warping
[2:00:00] <MESeele> Thanks for the stream Plague!
[2:00:06] <peachteagaming> play it again
[2:00:08] <KellBeII> \o/
[2:00:11] <LunarRemix> You could try speedrunning it.
