[0:00:21] <mrgaster8> @PlagueOfGripes hey plague twitch is playing up when i was watching pats stream finished i went to his vod to catch up but it didnt saved to his vods and he lost 2 hours
[0:00:24] <FinchBot> hooray!
[0:00:25] <OToole42> yay
[0:00:28] <+HRDSalami654> Indeed it did.
[0:00:30] <red_blaster> Sound, yes
[0:00:31] <jggoryl> aw yeah
[0:00:47] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh, I see the hightlights, and the point use, there we go.
[0:00:55] <rudiciuscaesar> see, told you, used it to go for the batchroom
[0:01:11] <+HRDSalami654> American internet is the best.
[0:01:12] <Livelinne> Bit are like twich's original change currency. You can throw them to streamers and make their day a bit better
[0:01:26] <%CyberDingus> HELLO
[0:01:31] <%CyberDingus> Eli, what happened?
[0:01:31] <arkv01> we took your cookies plague :)
[0:01:33] <+HRDSalami654> It was me Plague.
[0:01:36] <rudiciuscaesar> @Livelinne how does one acquire bits? Literally just signed up for Twitch yesterday.
[0:01:37] <Sokumotanaka> IT was me I took the cookies
[0:01:38] <+HRDSalami654> I stole your cookies.
[0:01:55] <Sokumotanaka> Yup
[0:02:02] <arkv01> america is held together by duct tape
[0:02:12] <Livelinne> @rudiciuscaesar you purchase them with real money
[0:02:33] <rudiciuscaesar> @Livelinne Thank you.
[0:02:36] <+ErrorinBluescreen> People literally can't fucking stay indoors to save lives
[0:02:41] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Watching America respond to this from another country has been like "Yikes lads, maybe catch on there."
[0:02:42] <Shwepie> You acquire bits by converting real money to bits. Or watch a bunch of ads to get a pittance amount.
[0:02:44] <arkv01> gotta wait til all the boomers are dead
[0:02:53] <arkv01> you saw those biden vs bernie numbers
[0:02:59] <+HRDSalami654> I really hate our country.
[0:03:02] <Livelinne> @rudiciuscaesar you’re welcome! VirtualHug
[0:03:04] <rudiciuscaesar> Plague's gonna accidentally start a revolution.
[0:03:23] <+HRDSalami654> How can we be a first world country and have the actually worst healthcare.
[0:03:25] <rudiciuscaesar> America does suck. Though I think we're more stuck in like 1992.
[0:03:28] <TheWe4pon> Kill all the boomers?
[0:03:31] <%CyberDingus> you poor poor americans. Living in 1st world, having more money and army forces than the rest of the planet combined :C
[0:03:36] <+HRDSalami654> The answer is we can't.
[0:03:37] <rudiciuscaesar> like the Soviets folded and we stopped updating
[0:03:40] <+Pyroclase> America is attempting to run on dreams and patriotism, which is terrible for your infrastructure
[0:03:42] <Sokumotanaka> Mmmm this Tea!
[0:03:51] <arkv01> the latter most likely
[0:03:52] <rudiciuscaesar> or until Char Aznable drops Axis onto earth, I mean....
[0:04:07] <BillieNoMates> Thats all you do tho, Eli
[0:04:13] <+HRDSalami654> But Plague, America was the best in the 50s!
[0:04:20] <Livelinne> Welcome back!
[0:04:21] <+Pyroclase> Awww man, I missed Cloud sitting on a bench?!
[0:04:23] <+ErrorinBluescreen> So uhhh
[0:04:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> awww
[0:04:27] <arkv01> kittty!
[0:04:34] <rudiciuscaesar> idk, the Soviets were cool back in the 1950s too. "cool" might be the wrong adjective.
[0:04:42] <%CyberDingus> ice cool
[0:04:43] <jiin6> thats story is funked up
[0:04:43] <+not_crabby> :<
[0:04:43] <+HRDSalami654> Even though the only reason we were the best is because we were the only country that wasn't bombed to shit.
[0:04:44] <MrHappyFunshine> I wonder if America would split into each stat self governing
[0:04:49] <Livelinne> CoolCat
[0:04:52] <+HRDSalami654> Fucking hate these people.
[0:04:55] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Who's looking into what qualifies as moving to Europe as a refugee when trump is voted immediate emergency powers
[0:05:00] <SupportWriter> HISTORY JANITORS
[0:05:07] <+ErrorinBluescreen> and establishes the first galactic empire
[0:05:10] <jiin6> most FF games are stupid, especially the modern ones
[0:05:10] <arkv01> ok WHAT
[0:05:12] <+stephane3012> this scene is so stupid
[0:05:15] <arkv01> THE FUCK
[0:05:15] <rudiciuscaesar> I actually want to follow my friends into the desert states.
[0:05:17] <arkv01> they're RIGHT THERE
[0:05:18] <Livelinne> plagueGripes PJSalt
[0:05:21] <itsbullzie> still not on?
[0:05:22] <+Pyroclase> It's like a 3 hour sequence bloated up to 30 hours, it was always gonna be weird
[0:05:23] <+HRDSalami654> YAY, GOOD JOB AMERICA, YOU WERE LUCKY!
[0:05:23] <oshkeet41> Its also just similar enough that when they do add something you just kind of handwave/accepted before its like 'why mention that then'
[0:05:23] <arkv01> this is the dumbest
[0:05:24] <%CyberDingus> excuse you Nomura, what the fuck!?
[0:05:26] <Sol_Install> how do they not see them
[0:05:40] <BillieNoMates> Barret ass slam
[0:05:40] <rudiciuscaesar> and that dude's spine is broken.
[0:05:42] <%CyberDingus> BARRET YOU IDIOT
[0:05:44] <Sol_Install> this is stupid
[0:05:45] <arkv01> it was dumb, now it's hilarious
[0:05:46] <OToole42> wish that was me
[0:05:52] <Mr_Strut> Maybe it was a bluff?
[0:06:04] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah but all black guys look the same to Midgardians.
[0:06:05] <Huntercd> Why are the vehicles stuck in the 40s but they got holograms and shit?
[0:06:11] <+Pyroclase> if you murder everyone who sees you it is technically still sneaking
[0:06:14] <oshkeet41> It doesnt help you got someone like Barret who is... immediately identifiable. 'hey look for the big dude with a gun literally grafted on his arm'
[0:06:17] <arkv01> steampunk logic
[0:06:23] <rudiciuscaesar> did they know what they were doing back in the original?
[0:06:27] <jiin6> no JRPG protag does
[0:06:33] <BillieNoMates> they were incompetent in 7 as well tho
[0:06:35] <+Pyroclase> @Huntercd it's just the style, I assume. They can look old-fashioned and still be modern
[0:06:38] <rudiciuscaesar> there it is, no JRPG protag does, right on.
[0:06:39] <oshkeet41> Hologram nonsense feels very new-Nomura
[0:06:42] <kentrix11> They are really going off the seat of their pants, it kinda fits with how much of a ragtag team they are.
[0:06:45] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:07:03] <arkv01> things were a lot more forgivable back in the 90s cause everyone was kinda feeling their way while blind
[0:07:03] <oshkeet41> came up SOMETIMES in the old game mostly in a shrugging 'we dont have the polygons to do something more complicated' deal
[0:07:16] <oshkeet41> that too
[0:07:18] <jiin6> why would a president ever go near terrorists?
[0:07:26] <kentrix11> Plague if they see you are gonna counter they do that, you gotta not counter wait until he attacks then press the button when their animation starts, you know like a regular parry.
[0:07:34] <+Pyroclase> to sneak into the building
[0:07:36] <Sokumotanaka> Cloud barret couldn't control himself falling off the truck
[0:07:36] <Huntercd> So why isn't the fashion and weaponry in that style aswell? @Pyroclase
[0:07:40] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, that scene with President Shinra confronting you directly at Reactor 5 was kinda dumb.
[0:07:47] <rudiciuscaesar> it could have been Heidegger.
[0:07:56] <+Pyroclase> Parking Garages always have personnel entrances.
[0:07:58] <BillieNoMates> Time Jannies will rebuild the ENTIRE lobby for you
[0:08:00] <KessOrangeSoda> because they already had parking garage assets
[0:08:02] <+Pyroclase> @Huntercd I mean, cars and weapons can have different styles...
[0:08:03] <arkv01> we know they modeled the lobby from pre-release screenshots, so more padding I guess?
[0:08:06] <turbofolk> Shut up plague shut up tho
[0:08:13] <%True_Nexus> True_Nexus subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:08:20] <turbofolk> Dont question nomura
[0:08:26] <+Pyroclase> Sieze them, with your guns!
[0:08:34] <arkv01> also more scenes to play remixes of those who fight
[0:08:39] <BurdRightsActivist> Wow this combat looks fun, but it doesn't look like it has enough enemies interrupting your moves. We should fix that!Q
[0:08:48] <kentrix11> We are going thorugh here because it's the only other opening besides the front door.
[0:09:02] <mapimb> cloud really ate shit there
[0:09:03] <Livelinne> LUL
[0:09:06] <kentrix11> Plague that's a range attack.
[0:09:12] <%CyberDingus> Tifa is a good girl.
[0:09:13] <arkv01> fighting these 3Cs is pretty cool
[0:09:13] <+BigCoffee> those soldiers kinda suck ass compared to Roche
[0:09:16] <KessOrangeSoda> I've got pornographic evidence that says otherwise
[0:09:22] <kentrix11> Why do you blame Cloud for trying to parry a range attack?
[0:09:24] <%CyberDingus> @KessOrangeSoda do share
[0:09:28] <BillieNoMates> Tifa doesnt suck, hence Yuffie is the best girl. She sucks professionally
[0:09:32] <@Nightbot> @mrgaster8 -> Justice delivered! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:09:50] <Shwepie> If they really wanted to sneak in they should just dress up like maintenance workers and walk right in the front door.
[0:09:58] <mrgaster8> booo
[0:10:02] <MrHappyFunshine> Yuffie is a bad girl cause she is bad at everything
[0:10:08] <arkv01> got lost, time to motorboat tifa
[0:10:37] <Shwepie> No minimap?
[0:10:38] <Huntercd> She also a teenager who are dumb by their nature
[0:10:43] <BillieNoMates> Is it not that gap between the truck and box?
[0:10:43] <+stephane3012> that was the right way
[0:11:02] <rudiciuscaesar> God, this battle theme sounds so good. Niiicceee.
[0:11:03] <itsbullzie> I suck at figuring out simple details
[0:11:14] <OToole42> just want to go at clouds hair with a comb, make him look like a normal human
[0:11:31] <BillieNoMates> Can't do that. Mako gel is impossible to remove
[0:11:45] <+Pyroclase> nothing wrong with attention to detail
[0:12:04] <Djinnazz> Ocea regulations
[0:12:06] <jiin6> security detail
[0:12:06] <+Pyroclase> This music really sounds like star wars.
[0:12:27] <BillieNoMates> Did he do the Chadley bosses yet?
[0:12:33] <turbofolk> "those who fight further" remix is cool tho
[0:12:39] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah me
[0:12:41] <sosuke5> I think I said it once.
[0:12:53] <BillieNoMates> The best remix so far is Airbuster
[0:12:59] <Huntercd> Bond Villians
[0:12:59] <BurdRightsActivist> BIG PUNCH THE DOG
[0:13:00] <Sokumotanaka> Team rocket is still alive
[0:13:02] <BillieNoMates> But there's a great one later
[0:13:09] <law240> so Easy mode
[0:13:19] <MrHappyFunshine> Barret "Pupper puncher" Wallace
[0:13:19] <Ravenian96> When you can impose your will upon them :D
[0:13:26] <kentrix11> When they are brain dead?
[0:13:32] <GeltonZ> That reminds me: I still want Final Fantasy Musou. (Especially if it was Ivalice Musou! But I'd take Dissidia too)
[0:13:38] <%caramello_man> @BillieNoMates he did leviathan but didn't finish bahamut
[0:13:55] <itsbullzie> I feels like the developers didn't really care for the story or the fights but the fan base of FF7
[0:13:59] <SilverRoddo> The Joker from Dark Knight said, “go get em,” when Batman approached him. But not verbatim.
[0:14:04] <kentrix11> Everything you say makes it seem like you just want sandbags to beat on without really thinking about how to open them up?
[0:14:07] <Djinnazz> then it'd just be a series of rooms
[0:14:11] <leeboo1211> Loading times?
[0:14:11] <Dark_Wint3r> Guess they didn't want big empty rooms
[0:14:11] <KessOrangeSoda> makes it feel more labyrinthine and thus longer
[0:14:25] <arkv01> japanese etiquette dictates you not step over boxes
[0:14:33] <+stephane3012> same level design as ff13
[0:14:57] <FinchBot> this game seems like it needs some kind of aggro management
[0:14:59] <kentrix11> Fire makes quick work of...I'm getting tired of saying this
[0:15:04] <+CrimsonDio11> plague is having massive frame drops now huh
[0:15:07] <BurdRightsActivist> MANY SHIT ON SCREEN = BETTER GAME. wow this is so good, thanks max!
[0:15:13] <GeltonZ> I'm sure there was a beta where the enemies DIDN'T target the player controlled character and it went poorly.
[0:15:53] <GeltonZ> The question is: When the enemies targetted other party members, did it make it too hard because you couldn't keep track of them or too easy because you could just murder them from behind?
[0:16:01] <turbofolk> Max is fully nostalgia blinded, dont think he is gonna admit to the games faults anytime soon
[0:16:24] <sosuke5> 'gripes', one might say
[0:16:24] <GeltonZ> You mean your PLAGUE of GRIPES?
[0:16:29] <+Pyroclase> I expect this game's reception to cool a liiiittle bit after it comes out. 8/10 sounds about right.
[0:16:41] <turbofolk> Truly we are the plague of gripes
[0:16:45] <itsbullzie> I like it when you criticize though.
[0:16:50] <BurdRightsActivist> FORCE the world out of the honeymoon phase. BE THE CHANGE YOU WANNA BE
[0:16:51] <arkv01> this escalator Kreygasm
[0:16:52] <KessOrangeSoda> I want there to be elevator music here
[0:17:00] <Sokumotanaka> Make a video maybe you might bring out some insights into design flaws some people may agree with
[0:17:05] <OToole42> all the time
[0:17:05] <ToeBeanHeaven> ME
[0:17:05] <@DCN2049> sometimes
[0:17:05] <Sokumotanaka> Yes
[0:17:06] <rudiciuscaesar> No, I too worry about that.
[0:17:06] <Thatdan> god yes
[0:17:06] <Djinnazz> ALL THE TIME
[0:17:06] <arkv01> sometimes
[0:17:07] <jiin6> all the time
[0:17:07] <itsbullzie> yep
[0:17:07] <+ComradePenguin> all the time
[0:17:08] <turbofolk> When i was 9 yeah
[0:17:08] <Apolonm> no
[0:17:08] <IntrepidEye> yes
[0:17:10] <Rainphoon> all the time!
[0:17:13] <Monstergelo> shoelace?
[0:17:14] <Sokumotanaka> That's my biggest fear!
[0:17:16] <GeltonZ> Jokes on you! I DON'T WEAR SHOELACES! HA!
[0:17:17] <Huntercd> Yea kinda
[0:17:18] <kentrix11> no
[0:17:18] <mrlastchance1> My girlfriend does. She has to have like 2 spaces in front of her and behind her while on an escalator
[0:17:22] <rudiciuscaesar> I know a girl who lost 2 toes cuz of that when we were in kindergarten
[0:17:23] <+Pyroclase> There's a very infamous video of someome being dragged into an open escalator panel
[0:17:24] <Livelinne> Yea kind of
[0:17:25] <arkv01> I mean I could always fling my shoes off
[0:17:32] <Djinnazz> Those are in foreign countries mostly
[0:17:33] <KessOrangeSoda> there's a video of a Chinese woman getting EATEN by an escalator and only has time to throw her child to safety
[0:17:37] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes No escalators? Not even in the wild?
[0:17:40] <srkAres> if youre wearing shoes w/o shoelaces then its irrational, yeah
[0:17:43] <BurdRightsActivist> The last time I saw an escalator was when I went to Alberta, that was fucking ages AGO
[0:17:43] <rudiciuscaesar> WOAH
[0:17:44] <Shwepie> When I was like four my jacket got caught in one.
[0:17:52] <Vaiire> Escalators, escalators, escalators! Eels...
[0:18:03] <jiin6> escalator is just another form of thresher
[0:18:09] <vonmaultke> I have seen a lot of people getting laces and clothes stuck in escalators where i work
[0:18:13] <arkv01> lobby?
[0:18:13] <GeltonZ> @KessOrangeSoda Holy crap that has to be a shitty escalator design flaw! There's no way that could happen normally! I refuse to believe it!
[0:18:24] <arkv01> feels amazing man
[0:18:25] <BurdRightsActivist> Bruh this shinra interior is classy as hell
[0:18:32] <Victory_Boss> barret plans 9/11
[0:18:39] <KessOrangeSoda> @GeltonZ it was literally breaking apart right as they reached the top
[0:18:45] <jiin6> stairs are optional
[0:18:46] <rudiciuscaesar> @KessOrangeSoda Jesus Christ dude, now I'm glad the mall near me was closed by the state police lol.
[0:18:50] <GeltonZ> @KessOrangeSoda Oh wow.
[0:18:52] <ToeBeanHeaven> >Expecting choice in this day and age
[0:18:53] <ToeBeanHeaven> HAHAHAHAH
[0:18:59] <ToeBeanHeaven> Yeah, nah.
[0:19:00] <BurdRightsActivist> @Victory_Boss Mako can't melt steel beams!
[0:19:05] <+Pyroclase> they clearly wanted to show off every last bit of content. I can't blame them, with so much money poured into every inch of this game.
[0:19:07] <Nenatab> @kessorangesoda I saw that one. Scary stuff.
[0:19:12] <+MrPervSan> Expecting choice in a Nomura game OMEGALUL
[0:19:15] <sosuke5> Giving it to Tifa is CANON
[0:19:16] <OToole42> I always gave it to marlene
[0:19:23] <Dark_Wint3r> Did the choices really have that much of a significance in the original?
[0:19:24] <OToole42> for that barret date
[0:19:31] <Djinnazz> True, but most of that stuff doesn't have a pay off till after Mifgar.
[0:19:39] <itsbullzie> Why not give it too Jessie?
[0:19:39] <Sokumotanaka> We'll have to fight the ghost for choice
[0:19:45] <rudiciuscaesar> SEE, Shinra shouldn't have this fucking tech!
[0:19:47] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah that's too beyond
[0:19:50] <TheWe4pon> inb4 railroaded gold saucer date
[0:19:50] <turbofolk> Shut up plague you dont know
[0:19:51] <+Pyroclase> Weren't there holograms in Crisis Core?
[0:19:56] <rudiciuscaesar> they have like, shitty terminators at best.
[0:19:56] <Monstergelo> it's magic force field
[0:20:06] <+Pyroclase> it looks pretty
[0:20:06] <kentrix11> Isn't that just barrier materia?
[0:20:06] <KessOrangeSoda> It's a Protect spell
[0:20:07] <ToeBeanHeaven> It's "Magic" Eli, Kingdom Hearts "Magic"
[0:20:07] <jiin6> yeah they had combat holograms
[0:20:09] <Djinnazz> i think it's just glass.
[0:20:09] <mrlastchance1> Didn't they have fore fields when red tries to fuck aerith?
[0:20:12] <Josshoo> They have fully functioning combot robots, they're pretty far
[0:20:13] <BurdRightsActivist> @Pyroclase There was a VR room, that's i
[0:20:15] <kingra> Magitek is cool
[0:20:18] <rudiciuscaesar> fascinating with this tech, belts, and bad hair designs.
[0:20:21] <Huntercd> It gets turned off by a computer
[0:20:21] <Monstergelo> it's magic vr
[0:20:21] <Dark_Wint3r> Could it be magic?
[0:20:22] <arkv01> I like sci-fi but yeah these technological retcons kinda throw things for a loop
[0:20:23] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Because it's the same small team of high-level creatives.
[0:20:24] <Hydrapissed> its cool?
[0:20:28] <Livelinne> Because it’s shinyyyyyy...
[0:20:33] <Tikigod784> wall materia installed in the desk
[0:20:33] <GeltonZ> Well to be fair, the Nokia cell phones were new (and sponsored) at the time.
[0:20:35] <jiin6> hexagons are a strong shape
[0:20:39] <Livelinne> Sooo fancyyyy
[0:20:39] <Huntercd> It looks jarring
[0:20:41] <Sokumotanaka> It's because they wanted to probably throw all this in ff25 but because no one liked it they stuffed all the assets in this
[0:20:43] <arkv01> shiny is the most likely correct answer
[0:20:45] <kentrix11> @ToeBeanHeaven no KH tech is just the matrix on crack.
[0:20:46] <CaptHat211> Hello, strangers. How's it going?
[0:20:56] <TreesDontTalk> BUT SPIRITS WITHIN HAD DA SPACE SHIPS ,PLAGUE
[0:21:02] <+Risingxiv> Why does Tifa punch while Shinra troops shoot guns at her?
[0:21:04] <KessOrangeSoda> Take the stairs
[0:21:05] <rudiciuscaesar> @CaptHat211 what up, Plague just got into Shinra HQ
[0:21:14] <arkv01> fukk da stairs
[0:21:14] <Huntercd> If feels like some people don't belong in their own world
[0:21:19] <rudiciuscaesar> those cafeteria chairs are amazing!
[0:21:20] <ToeBeanHeaven> Kingdom Hearts, where every pills is Tutti Frutti.
[0:21:26] <Hydrapissed> D:
[0:21:28] <kentrix11> They wanted the garage so you could have some kinda gameplay in betweent eh cutscenes.
[0:21:30] <arkv01> take the elevators that they could probably disconnect and drop you to your deaths
[0:21:33] <Josshoo> Heartless monsters
[0:21:36] <rudiciuscaesar> We didn't even have cushions at the one in my unviersity!
[0:21:37] <CaptHat211> @rudiciuscaesar Hmmm *nods head pretending to know what that is*
[0:21:47] <KessOrangeSoda> Avalanche: Making life better for the little guy by making their job harder through petty vandalism
[0:21:52] <arkv01> this lobby is hella comfy
[0:21:54] <mrlastchance1> This is pretty gorgeous
[0:21:57] <BurdRightsActivist> AVALANCHE! Mildly inconveniencing Shinra a CHAIR AT A TIME
[0:21:59] <arkv01> I'd love to explore it naked, don't ask why
[0:22:04] <turbofolk> That's the problem with anachronistic setting made up by japanese writers they never explain whyy things of 20 years ago share the space with future scifi shit
[0:22:32] <jiin6> Clouds JRPG eyes work
[0:22:35] <Huntercd> Exactly
[0:22:38] <SilverRoddo> Corporations have the coolest stuff, it’s a thematic commentary on conglomerates? I assume the story writers had that in mind.
[0:22:39] <kentrix11> @turbofolk Doesn't FF7 have mechs in anyway?
[0:22:44] <BurdRightsActivist> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
[0:22:48] <turbofolk> Remember naruto had shit of of feudal japan but shit mixed up like computers and FLAT TV's
[0:22:53] <+Neoripo> Yes
[0:22:56] <Hydrapissed> lighter then cloud no way
[0:22:58] <jiin6> Bio droids
[0:23:01] <CaptHat211> Damn, Eli
[0:23:02] <%CyberDingus> Eli let the BOOBS speak!!
[0:23:10] <jiin6> ONLY THEN
[0:23:10] <+Pyroclase> this is 1000% padding, sadly
[0:23:15] <arkv01> Really? When the whole game's already full of padding?
[0:23:21] <+some_brave_apollo> I really don't like how Cloud's classic design is prefectly recreated, but Tifa and Barret have been updated to wear more modern materials
[0:23:22] <arkv01> thats ballsy
[0:23:22] <mapimb> wait it hasnt already started
[0:23:23] <KessOrangeSoda> TRUE
[0:23:25] <arkv01> they tripled down on the padding
[0:23:26] <CaptHat211> And she punches things too, Eli
[0:23:27] <+BigCoffee> shes still better then aerith
[0:23:27] <mrlastchance1> Hey! She kicks good!
[0:23:27] <%CyberDingus> HUGE tracks of land
[0:23:29] <Huntercd> Tifa doesn't need padding
[0:23:29] <FinchBot> cloud is so much prettier than the girls characters
[0:23:29] <rudiciuscaesar> she has red eyes!
[0:23:31] <Tikigod784> she's got tekken combos
[0:23:31] <Hydrapissed> I mean she owned a bar that was kinda cool
[0:23:32] <rudiciuscaesar> Like Lulu!
[0:23:32] <leeboo1211> I got no problem with Tifa's character traits
[0:23:34] <rudiciuscaesar> and black hair!
[0:23:37] <rudiciuscaesar> Like Lulu!
[0:23:38] <jiin6> not the side quest or the plot ghosts? only Shinra building, that fella's blind
[0:23:41] <TreesDontTalk> Fucking hardline 90's phone surrounded by a high tech forcefield
[0:23:41] <turbofolk> SHE IS PLAGUE I WILL FIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET OVER IT!!!
[0:23:44] <arkv01> that sounds like woolie's favorite kinda gal LUL
[0:23:45] <Dark_Wint3r> You hate that Tifa doesn't talk, but also when she does
[0:23:46] <%CyberDingus> and she is a childhood friend. She is a GOOD girl. Good girls have HUGE boobs
[0:23:46] <tolloponik> in boruto the hidden leaf became New York and naruto has an I pad
[0:23:48] <+whiskey_wolfe_> No she has TRAUMA because she HAD a bar.
[0:23:50] <leeboo1211> That's the ONLY trait Tifa needs
[0:23:51] <+Neoripo> No, that happens later. What happens now is what happened in the original trying to go from floor to floor
[0:23:52] <CaptHat211> Aeirth likes flowers and being impaled
[0:23:52] <ToeBeanHeaven> Man, is it bad that part of me wishes they just didn't bother with a Remake unless it was gonna be Resident Evil REmake tier? I'm not diggin' this "Reimagining" thing at all.
[0:23:52] <Djinnazz> lol
[0:23:55] <BurdRightsActivist> The only reason why she's best girl is because Aerith is just a pre-corpse, and you wouldn't want to commit pre-necro would you?
[0:23:57] <rudiciuscaesar> LMAO FUCKING DEAD
[0:23:57] <Hydrapissed> wtf are those even
[0:24:00] <Sokumotanaka> This is giving me anxeity cause she can die
[0:24:03] <arkv01> and tifa's soft tushy
[0:24:06] <Hydrapissed> what are those for real ?
[0:24:09] <SilverRoddo> A bar is awesome to have tho.
[0:24:14] <+some_brave_apollo> oh hey there's the car they're goiing to escape in
[0:24:16] <TheWe4pon> He Eli was it a bad sign when we couldn't assign names to characters?
[0:24:22] <Hydrapissed> for real wtf
[0:24:26] <mrlastchance1> They're big fancy couches
[0:24:27] <+some_brave_apollo> its got the lights on and everything
[0:24:28] <jiin6> its a display
[0:24:30] <Dark_Wint3r> Aren't those like seats?
[0:24:31] <Sokumotanaka> Good thing these temperpetdic mattresses were here.
[0:24:38] <arkv01> memory foam couches
[0:24:39] <Hydrapissed> mattress display?
[0:24:39] <turbofolk> they have them in city offices lobbys farm boi
[0:24:40] <kentrix11> Honestly this lobby looks really good.
[0:24:41] <Josshoo> They're for Shinra orgies
[0:24:42] <+Neoripo> I have seens those things TBH
[0:24:45] <Huntercd> The batteries on those cars should be dead
[0:24:47] <CaptHat211> FF6 reference?
[0:24:49] <Hydrapissed> o0o0o0o0 yah it will
[0:24:52] <BurdRightsActivist> HE HAS NO IDEA.
[0:24:55] <Hydrapissed> tifa is gana jump A PLANET
[0:24:58] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, the train does look like it's from FF6
[0:24:59] <KessOrangeSoda> "I thought I was dead!"
[0:25:08] <ToeBeanHeaven> >Advent Children bullshit fightscenes in this REmake
[0:25:11] <Djinnazz> That's EVERY FF.
[0:25:13] <tolloponik> Power Scaling
[0:25:13] <arkv01> she gained new tech from the end of 7 to AC LUL
[0:25:14] <ToeBeanHeaven> IT'S DISC 1 WHAT THE FUCK!?
[0:25:19] <FinchBot> at least in kh sora is always bullshit
[0:25:19] <ToeBeanHeaven> GODDDDAMNIT
[0:25:21] <IntrepidEye> Flash back to that part where they could get over a chainlink fence
[0:25:24] <Josshoo> There's less gravity in cutscenes
[0:25:25] <kingra> Nooooooo Kappa
[0:25:26] <turbofolk> But its always been like that plague
[0:25:26] <Fredcome2bed> ...
[0:25:26] <Dark_Wint3r> I honestly cannot think of a jrpg that doesn't have the cutscene issue
[0:25:28] <+Neoripo> Guys, easy with the spoilers
[0:25:31] <GeltonZ> It's almost like Plague has been spoiled or something XD
[0:25:33] <IntrepidEye> *couldn't
[0:25:37] <TreesDontTalk> Jessie fell down one stair to hurt her leg..... doodWesker And Tifa just fell 15 feet onto her tailbone
[0:25:43] <Dark_Wint3r> Except Yakuza has the reverse problem
[0:25:47] <kentrix11> It's the end of KH2 were Sora can suddenly cut skyscrappers.
[0:25:58] <KessOrangeSoda> Open up the hood of each car in the lobby and steal the spark plugs
[0:26:00] <Hydrapissed> Future force shields old trains
[0:26:01] <Hydrapissed> huh
[0:26:05] <OToole42> you're a cute little model plague <3
[0:26:16] <arkv01> sora can cut skyscrapers? I don't remember that cutscene but I'll take your word for it since nomura loves destroying infrastructure
[0:26:18] <kentrix11> @TreesDontTalk wasn't Jessie also attacked by the time ghosts?
[0:26:21] <Victory_Boss> Aerith is trapped in Honda HQ!
[0:26:21] <SuperVaderMan> It would be impolite to cross the rope barrier
[0:26:28] <KessOrangeSoda> @arkv01 end of KH2 iirc
[0:26:29] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Keep on the look out for a large framed picture
[0:26:30] <Tikigod784> jump on one of the trucks
[0:26:37] <law240> ??????
[0:26:41] <mrlastchance1> SORA UNLOCK THAT DOOR
[0:26:42] <oshkeet41> I think thats also what bugs me about the fancier tech. the diesel/train stuff seems like someone on the design team loves that stuff. the new tech just feels like scifi for scifi's sake
[0:26:47] <Hydrapissed> it is
[0:26:47] <turbofolk> Thats a lady restrooms
[0:26:49] <mrlastchance1> That's actually kind of cool
[0:26:49] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Use the mirror's edge skills
[0:26:50] <Huntercd> That the bathroom
[0:26:50] <Hydrapissed> SORA is in there
[0:26:52] <%laserbeaming> KINGDOM HEARTS ARE BATHROOMS
[0:26:54] <terminusterminal> Did you just assume that bathroom's gender?
[0:27:04] <ToeBeanHeaven> Use yer keyblade, Eli, ya gotta shine their dark souls in liiiiiiight
[0:27:04] <+some_brave_apollo> WOMEN ARE JUST SHITTY LOCKS AM I RIGHT FELLAS
[0:27:06] <kentrix11> @arkv01 You literally throw skyscrappers to a mecha dragon to open it up to attacks in the end of KH2, it's great.
[0:27:10] <arkv01> the heartless lurk in the dirtiest urinals
[0:27:27] <+Neoripo> There was
[0:27:33] <TreesDontTalk> @kentrix11 yeah. But I like to think they just made her twist her ankle
[0:27:36] <turbofolk> Big brain plague
[0:27:36] <law240> WAIT
[0:27:40] <Hydrapissed> wheres my giant neir ladder
[0:27:44] <law240> there is a weapon
[0:27:45] <SlimeBoogey> wait go back down the ladder
[0:27:46] <law240> here
[0:27:51] <Hydrapissed> billions
[0:27:52] <+Neoripo> 2
[0:27:53] <SlimeBoogey> there's a chest across the way
[0:27:54] <BurdRightsActivist> @some_brave_apollo COCK LOCKS 4Head
[0:27:57] <%laserbeaming> at least 2
[0:28:03] <+whiskey_wolfe_> you already had leslie
[0:28:03] <arkv01> cloud's face melts off and it's just sora
[0:28:04] <jiin6> its fucking nomura ITS all KH references
[0:28:11] <+CrimsonDio11> plague please dont miss that chest
[0:28:11] <+Risingxiv> The whispers are Organization XIII
[0:28:14] <turbofolk> Just you wait plague Donald and goofy will show up in FF7R 2
[0:28:15] <Sol_Install> I like that they can't just
[0:28:17] <Thatdan> more then there needs to be i'm sure
[0:28:17] <jiin6> did he get the purp chest?
[0:28:19] <Sol_Install> you know, PUNCH the door?
[0:28:21] <ToeBeanHeaven> Real talk, I'm expecting the end of this "REMAKE" to FUCKING SHOEHORN IN XIII Versus with Yazora and Sora and ALLLLL that bullshit.
[0:28:24] <ToeBeanHeaven> Fucking Nomura...
[0:28:25] <Sol_Install> or SHOOT the door?
[0:28:28] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes It's fanservice, come on Kappa
[0:28:28] <+some_brave_apollo> lel
[0:28:30] <kentrix11> OG FF7 had a fair number of this stuff though, so it's just being faithfull in some ways.
[0:28:33] <oshkeet41> i wish i had some wings
[0:28:33] <Hydrapissed> sephiroth has the key to clouds heart
[0:28:34] <law240> purple chest
[0:28:35] <Sol_Install> cut it for godsake
[0:28:38] <CaptHat211> Okay in all seriousness what is Tifa's personality BESIDES her love for punching things and having breasts?
[0:28:39] <SilverRoddo> Mirror’s Edge Tifa
[0:28:50] <arkv01> the key to your heart cloud... is in my tight leather pants
[0:28:53] <FinchBot> by part 3 all the characters will just speak in vague heart jargon
[0:28:53] <Huntercd> How does he fly with one wing?
[0:28:54] <TheWe4pon> So much padding that you start to doubt the real size of Tifa's tits. @PlagueOfGripes
[0:29:09] <Hydrapissed> yahhh
[0:29:10] <+Finalknightmare> true
[0:29:12] <Hydrapissed> and it was a flesh wing thing
[0:29:13] <KessOrangeSoda> No, Crisis Core retconned that
[0:29:18] <+Pyroclase> yeah, that's 100% from KH
[0:29:19] <BurdRightsActivist> Max is CUMMING right now. This padding is SO HOT
[0:29:21] <+some_brave_apollo> yeah but it looks cool
[0:29:22] <Hydrapissed> it is dumb
[0:29:23] <rudiciuscaesar> OH GOD CRISIS CORE
[0:29:25] <turbofolk> I kinda expect nomura will incorporate FF7r into the new KH saga
[0:29:26] <ToeBeanHeaven> I'll eat my own ass if this "remake" doesn't end in a Kingdom Hearts CircleJerk Extravaganza
[0:29:28] <TreesDontTalk> 2020, the year of Remakes with skorts doodCap
[0:29:28] <kentrix11> That was Crisis Core.
[0:29:29] <jiin6> no thats Crisis core
[0:29:33] <%LordSDB> Yeah that KH fault
[0:29:35] <IntrepidEye> I thought they started pulling Final Fantasy away from Kingdom Hearts a lot
[0:29:37] <arkv01> the one wing motif is cool shutup, nomura said
[0:29:38] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, fan fiction, Plague is right. Zack was hallucinating those wings due to brain damage.
[0:29:41] <GeltonZ> Well that was because people in SOLDIER were ALSO turning into dumb monsters.
[0:29:51] <jiin6> JRPG logic man
[0:29:53] <rudiciuscaesar> the wings look awful.
[0:29:55] <Huntercd> What purpose would one wing serve?
[0:29:55] <mrlastchance1> OH she'll get off alright
[0:30:00] <CaptHat211> I saw so much of that one wing nonsense in art from Middle School and High School.
[0:30:04] <oshkeet41> like if you wanna add in that iconggaphy, just put it on a jacket as an emblem or something, not literal.
[0:30:10] <Sol_Install> yep
[0:30:11] <Hydrapissed> OGGLE that tifa
[0:30:12] <+Neoripo> YES
[0:30:12] <KessOrangeSoda> Crisis Core: the one with Gackt portraying himself in Final Fantasy
[0:30:16] <CaptHat211> *DING DING DING*
[0:30:17] <rudiciuscaesar> fan service Tifa moment.
[0:30:18] <+Pyroclase> I don't understand the cutscene of them actually flyinbg with just the one wing
[0:30:19] <turbofolk> oh yeah
[0:30:20] <jiin6> look at her short shorts
[0:30:20] <arkv01> the funniest part about the one wing is it actually flaps and lets him fly
[0:30:24] <%CyberDingus> I am entertained!
[0:30:26] <arkv01> full anime logic
[0:30:28] <SupportWriter> If only she kept her short skirt
[0:30:33] <+Neoripo> Look at Tifa's belly sequence
[0:30:34] <kentrix11> This theme is comfy.
[0:30:39] <Hydrapissed> shoulda been a pole she worked to open the door
[0:30:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine faling the jump again and having to repeat this sequence 4Head
[0:30:41] <rudiciuscaesar> this theme is nice, that is true.
[0:30:42] <Hydrapissed> bayo style lol
[0:30:50] <rudiciuscaesar> speed run annihilator
[0:30:52] <Void_The_Dark> This takes so long. monkaS
[0:30:55] <Vaiire> Oh, man. It's my favourite part from the original: getting to the receptionist's desk. Oh, wait--
[0:30:56] <Sokumotanaka> That's the issue with several years of ff7 getting fanficed for the sake of being "kool"
[0:30:59] <+Neoripo> Also rope callback
[0:31:00] <arkv01> I super look forward to speedruns of this
[0:31:02] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> When they talk about padding, some people talk about the added content, i refer to this shit
[0:31:05] <Hydrapissed> the speed run is turning off the game
[0:31:05] <+Pyroclase> glitchless runs tho
[0:31:13] <arkv01> I want to see this game crunched in 5 hours
[0:31:17] <+some_brave_apollo> speedrunners have no shame, people will play this whole segment over and over in search of secret strats
[0:31:18] <rudiciuscaesar> woah what is she evne on?
[0:31:24] <rudiciuscaesar> is that just a string of lights?
[0:31:26] <KessOrangeSoda> I am SURE speed runners will be looking to skip this tedious bullshit ASAP
[0:31:27] <turbofolk> GAIN MOMETUM
[0:31:29] <CaptHat211> This is a better Tomb Raider game than the last 3 TR games.
[0:31:33] <Sol_Install> god the padding
[0:31:45] <arkv01> ok but how do you get out tifa?
[0:31:46] <law240> you missed a weapon
[0:31:47] <rudiciuscaesar> *victory fanfare*
[0:31:48] <BurdRightsActivist> inb4 BOSS FIGHT
[0:31:54] <arkv01> ah yes, beep boop keyboard
[0:31:55] <IntrepidEye> awesome gameplay right here
[0:32:01] <Hydrapissed> I guess its to show shinra hogging the wealth and tech from the poor? maybe idk
[0:32:03] <kentrix11> Honestly my biggest complain is not being able to skip this in replays but overall I didn't mind much.
[0:32:05] <TreesDontTalk> With Windows 95
[0:32:07] <rudiciuscaesar> Shinra Christmas lights.
[0:32:08] <Sokumotanaka> RUN
[0:32:10] <Sol_Install> The fact they lower it
[0:32:13] <ToeBeanHeaven> How come Shinra Security hasn't just nuked that floor yet?
[0:32:19] <ToeBeanHeaven> This is ridiculous...
[0:32:22] <Monstergelo> wait can't they jump from the start?
[0:32:23] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Remember Bugenhagen had a holgraphic projector
[0:32:23] <arkv01> cmon shinra you erect a forcefield but dont set a password on your consoles?
[0:32:26] <+some_brave_apollo> there's only 15 hours left of the game, don't worry
[0:32:29] <Sol_Install> after tifa did all of that is fuking why
[0:32:30] <rudiciuscaesar> Yeah, don't say that, you'll get banned.
[0:32:31] <KessOrangeSoda> Hope you like 59 flights of stairs padding!
[0:32:31] <+BonewheelVanguard> psa1guy
[0:32:32] <Hydrapissed> some wep for tifa is around there I think
[0:32:33] <SilverRoddo> Now, enhance.
[0:32:34] <ThatGuyThere03> spoilers: cloud does the thing
[0:32:34] <oshkeet41> I really hope they dont learn so hard on every remotely imposing villain also being totally omniscient
[0:32:34] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> you actually did miss a weapon for tifa that isnt a joke
[0:32:35] <+Neoripo> Also, you really missed a chest
[0:32:42] <+Risingxiv> @PlagueOfGripes you missed the ending back there
[0:32:43] <+stratibario> but there is a weapon in here
[0:32:46] <arkv01> bugenhagens planetarium for kids!
[0:32:47] <rudiciuscaesar> planetarium?
[0:32:48] <+Hallucinagenic> ITS A TRASH TIFA WEAPON FROM MEMORY, DONT STRESS
[0:32:49] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes you actually did miss a weapon go back to the car room there's a chest
[0:32:53] <+Hallucinagenic> soz caps
[0:32:59] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> you had to get it during that segment as tifa to get it
[0:33:00] <Josshoo> @arkv01 Cmon man, what if we forgot the password!
[0:33:03] <law240> you missed a purple chest with a weapon in it
[0:33:05] <BurdRightsActivist> ITS A TRASH TIFA WEAPON FROM MEMORY, DONT STRESS
[0:33:15] <kentrix11> @arkv01 "we didn't expect people to simply go from above the force field"
[0:33:18] <fluffy_sauce> well cid did have a rocket ship
[0:33:18] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, Plague is a completionist though.
[0:33:24] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes Climb onto the truck hood in the lobby, hop onto the structure behind the display, and follow the hidden path to reach this chest
[0:33:24] <CaptHat211> Eli, you may dislike Tifa, but she's better than Aerith b/c Aerith always came across as too wispy, boring, and oblivious.
[0:33:30] <rudiciuscaesar> he gets everything in Dark Souls, uses only a few weapons.
[0:33:34] <+BonewheelVanguard> The Planetaboratory
[0:33:34] <+Pyroclase> There are planes. There's a sunken cargo plane you can visit.
[0:33:39] <+Neoripo> And Helicopters
[0:33:43] <rudiciuscaesar> oh and no space suits for their rockets.
[0:33:44] <MKUltima> A bunch of scientists got high on peyote and Cosmo Canyon and the Space Program were the result
[0:33:44] <ThatGuyThere03> doesn't Cid have a plane?
[0:33:45] <Hydrapissed> woulda been cool if wutai had planes and didnt share the tech lol
[0:33:47] <kentrix11> Poorly written setting?
[0:33:47] <jggoryl> every jrpg has gotta go to space
[0:33:50] <BurdRightsActivist> They have planes, remember the lil bronco?
[0:33:51] <jggoryl> it's the law
[0:33:56] <+CrimsonDio11> its on top of the train cases
[0:33:59] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> look up
[0:34:04] <+some_brave_apollo> it's even weirder now, where everyone dresses like they shop at GAP
[0:34:04] <mrgaster8> hes not
[0:34:04] <arkv01> 7 is a mix of steampunk and cyberpunk, at least in midgar
[0:34:07] <turbofolk> Im telling you plague Japanese can't write anachronistic settings for shit
[0:34:07] <Tikigod784> he's not lying, you do the platforming thing to get it
[0:34:12] <mrgaster8> look up
[0:34:17] <Hydrapissed> PLatforming awww yeh
[0:34:17] <TheWe4pon> Climb onto the truck hood in the lobby, hop onto the structure behind the display, and follow the hidden path to reach this chest
[0:34:19] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> it is
[0:34:25] <Tikigod784> welp
[0:34:28] <Tikigod784> that's that
[0:34:28] <+shootbang_exe> it was during tifa parlour segment
[0:34:31] <rudiciuscaesar> no joking around, can Plague still get it?
[0:34:31] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> you qould have to reload its on a train case
[0:34:32] <Hydrapissed> oh yah thats that
[0:34:39] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes There is a chest on top of the displays that you have to use Tifa to get to, just continue
[0:34:41] <kentrix11> I think there's a boss that you can steal a weapon from.
[0:34:45] <OToole42> fuck it
[0:34:47] <arkv01> is the level cap 50?

[0:35:43] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> its dumb as fuck, i missed it on my first run too, and had to redo this whole part, its really bad design
[0:35:49] <rudiciuscaesar> Sorry Plague!
[0:35:49] <Shwepie> Did Plague do all the the side quests in chapter 14?
[0:35:50] <TreesDontTalk> brucegPickitup doodRage brucegPickitup
[0:35:50] <arkv01> run ruined, reset time
[0:35:51] <kentrix11> Remember how the Zack flashback which is crucial to Cloud's backstory was optional?
[0:35:52] <BurdRightsActivist> Tbh, don't mind ultimate weapons missing. They're like secret shit anyways
[0:35:53] <+Pyroclase> can you try to parkour again?
[0:36:10] <rudiciuscaesar> losing content.
[0:36:10] <+some_brave_apollo> yeah I feel that
[0:36:21] <IntrepidEye> theres a couple materia later on you can easily miss from not doing some obscure shit
[0:36:22] <arkv01> I mean stopping completely is a bit over the top, but taking a break is fair
[0:36:30] <+Neoripo> There is also a bangle only sold in Sector 7 weapon shop, so if you want all the gear start all over
[0:36:31] <thecrazyanbu> Is it Flight of Icarus by Iron Maiden?
[0:36:32] <law240> I mean you still have the Hard Edge
[0:36:34] <+BigCoffee> there will prolly be a vending machine
[0:36:38] <rudiciuscaesar> like in FF8, you get a second chance to draw the summons.
[0:36:38] <ToeBeanHeaven> I feel the same way if I miss special dialogues or items and then it's like "WHOOPS, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME~"....fucking hell.
[0:36:41] <BurdRightsActivist> dude you FOUND A WHOLE BAND inside a chest? PogChamp
[0:36:45] <CaptHat211> yes
[0:36:46] <+some_brave_apollo> no doubt
[0:36:46] <BillieNoMates> yes
[0:36:47] <arkv01> yes
[0:36:47] <+BigCoffee> yes
[0:36:47] <Sol_Install> yes
[0:36:48] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> easilly
[0:36:48] <MKUltima> Ye
[0:36:48] <OToole42> oh it sure was
[0:36:48] <FessBC> yes
[0:36:49] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah
[0:36:49] <SlimeBoogey> absolutely
[0:36:49] <FinchBot> probably
[0:36:50] <IntrepidEye> yes
[0:36:52] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah i sometimes i will just cold turkey quit a game for like a week to month if that shit happens
[0:36:54] <+stephane3012> yes
[0:36:54] <+Finalknightmare> Yes
[0:36:56] <mrgaster8> kinda sad
[0:36:56] <arkv01> ff7r is an okay game indeed
[0:36:57] <+Pyroclase> FF7 was really ahead of its time. This is good but it's mostly just money.
[0:36:57] <rudiciuscaesar> FF7 OG was revolutionary at its time.
[0:36:57] <+Nekheny> yes
[0:36:57] <Huntercd> Yes
[0:36:59] <Fredcome2bed> yes
[0:37:01] <TheWe4pon> yes
[0:37:03] <arkv01> but then most games are okay these days
[0:37:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Shut up this game is PERFECT. Max said so! #Hype! LET'S GO
[0:37:04] <%LordSDB> This is a 7-8 out of 10
[0:37:04] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Oh goodness yes, this is all padding and fanservice. The story is a mess and the experience is muddy water.
[0:37:05] <ToeBeanHeaven> It's an okay game, I'm more excited for Trials of Mana than this by far.
[0:37:07] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes WAIT YOU CAN TAKE THE STAIRS
[0:37:10] <BillieNoMates> This game suffers because its some Kingdom Hearts version of FF7, including how it's written
[0:37:11] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> i like how they made the combat active but still made the magic slow as shit
[0:37:12] <Owkono> yes and its also a complete game
[0:37:13] <rudiciuscaesar> this game isn't breaking anything, nothing is revolutiionary
[0:37:16] <kentrix11> It was revolutionary so that's hard to top off.
[0:37:20] <arkv01> maybe it's just cause nothing tingles our neurons anymore like when we were kids
[0:37:20] <+stephane3012> itsnot better than persona
[0:37:22] <+some_brave_apollo> though saying that I feel that FF7 still looked kind of crappy compared to other PS1 games at the time
[0:37:23] <ToeBeanHeaven> Even that Xenoblade Chronicles Switch Port is lookin' good.
[0:37:24] <+Neoripo> This one deffinitely has pacing problems
[0:37:25] <rudiciuscaesar> except the dancing scene, that's a blessing.
[0:37:30] <IntrepidEye> This is a good game but it has a ton of annoying minor issues that build to hurt my enjoyment a lot
[0:37:33] <turbofolk> Max has compared FF7R to a yakuza and if it is the case this BAD yakuza game
[0:37:37] <ToeBeanHeaven> Can't wait to be REALLY feelin' the Monado.
[0:37:37] <Monstergelo> ff not meant for action
[0:37:39] <rudiciuscaesar> missing content is a failure of game design.
[0:37:40] <+Risingxiv> @PlagueOfGripes Does it feel like the devs didn't want to make this game?
[0:37:44] <SlimeBoogey> there's no items on the stairs just FYI
[0:37:45] <%JailShmixRemix> The dancing scene made this game a 8/10
[0:37:48] <MrHappyFunshine> it is a good game but it isn't something that people should look at as a gold standard for modern games
[0:37:52] <+Pyroclase> was there a side door?
[0:37:55] <oshkeet41> IDK i think you can have personal hype for agame in how it make ya feel and have that be seperate from knowing the mechanical issues objectively
[0:37:57] <SlimeBoogey> it's just additional dialogue
[0:37:57] <SupportWriter> @ToeBeanHeaven Not really a port when they are doing a full overall of the graphics and adding in an epilogue
[0:37:59] <jiin6> FF7 has and will always be Overrated
[0:38:00] <BurdRightsActivist> If tifa's breasts were to enlarge, would that mean tifa would become smarter in that case?
[0:38:02] <+Hallucinagenic> dont take the stairs to 59, its liter rally just some extra dialouge
[0:38:02] <fluffy_sauce> its funny because Goldeneye 007 actually won GOTY back in '97
[0:38:04] <atgithursdays> As someone who never played the OG, is it a good game?
[0:38:18] <CaptHat211> Did a girl who looked like Tifa break your heart in grade school, Eli?
[0:38:18] <arkv01> like we agreed on just now, ff7 is good for it's era
[0:38:19] <+some_brave_apollo> that is not good lighting for progress
[0:38:19] <%JailShmixRemix> The OG is a good game
[0:38:29] <+Neoripo> Welcome to actually fun
[0:38:34] <+BigCoffee> @PlagueOfGripes I'l give you this, gameplay and everything alone WITHOUT STORY this game is a solid 8/10 action rpg. Including the bait and switch scam story it's a 6/10. If you dont care about a rpg story I'd tell anyone to play this. If you care about it, I'd say wait for a discount.
[0:38:37] <KessOrangeSoda> 59 flights of padding
[0:38:46] <rudiciuscaesar> should have said die from a stroke.
[0:38:49] <arkv01> smoll bless
[0:38:52] <BillieNoMates> I wonder if they'll have a skip
[0:38:54] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao battle theme for the stairs!
[0:38:55] <kentrix11> @atgithursdays OG ff7 holds up incredebly well in a number of ways, the looks of the game not so much.
[0:38:56] <mapimb> FUCK
[0:38:59] <red_blaster> This is the one place where padding is acceptable
[0:39:00] <arkv01> 8.5
[0:39:04] <IntrepidEye> its a solid 8.5
[0:39:04] <BillieNoMates> 8.8
[0:39:04] <BurdRightsActivist> FF7/10 4hEAD
[0:39:04] <jiin6> prober 7
[0:39:05] <arkv01> yeee
[0:39:05] <BurdRightsActivist> 4Head
[0:39:06] <turbofolk> Make barret die of hearth stroke
[0:39:08] <+Neoripo> 8.5, yeah
[0:39:10] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's a 2 out of 5, we all know it.
[0:39:12] <ToeBeanHeaven> Real talk, I wish they would have waited to release the REmake in its entirety than this episodic bullshit.
[0:39:12] <mrgaster8> ill say 8
[0:39:13] <BillieNoMates> Twilight princess of Final Fantasy
[0:39:13] <+some_brave_apollo> is she going to call him a retard
[0:39:15] <turbofolk> its a 7.5
[0:39:17] <Fredcome2bed> Can't think on an instant where a remake of a classic had as much impact as the classic had relative to it's time
[0:39:20] <rudiciuscaesar> I give it a 10 out of 10 and solely because it's just DeviantArt fan fiction manifest, and I am highly biased.
[0:39:24] <BurdRightsActivist> @turbofolk Hearth
[0:39:27] <rudiciuscaesar> and admit my biased.
[0:39:29] <kentrix11> Man this got really negative all of a sudden.
[0:39:32] <Sol_Install> 8 just cause the gameplay hods it up
[0:39:34] <CaptHat211> yes?
[0:39:36] <Sol_Install> holds*
[0:39:36] <BurdRightsActivist> STILL IN A DREAM
[0:39:37] <+Neoripo> It had a blue ligh plague, come on Kappa
[0:39:43] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, Barret hauling ass up those stairs.
[0:39:48] <jiin6> well you commited now
[0:39:48] <+BigCoffee> Tifa's personality is = Caring
[0:39:52] <fluffy_sauce> you're losing the race!
[0:39:55] <turbofolk> FLAVOR DIALOGUE DONT YOU LOVE IT
[0:39:56] <+some_brave_apollo> "'c'mon barret"
[0:39:59] <jiin6> Tifa is team mom
[0:40:07] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes there is a weapon on the mayor's floor
[0:40:08] <kentrix11> This section i suppossed to talk in here plague may wanna pause the game.
[0:40:16] <+Neoripo> Get to climbing Plague, you are still on floor 10!
[0:40:18] <Huntercd> Tifa smokes them both
[0:40:18] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> its an 8.whatever for sure. if they covered the whole first disk I would appreciate this more. Even with all the extra stuff added they didn't make Midgar more interesting.
[0:40:21] <mapimb> WHAT
[0:40:27] <rudiciuscaesar> to be fair, that's a really outdated word now.
[0:40:29] <+some_brave_apollo> close enough i guess
[0:40:34] <BurdRightsActivist> HACK ME BARRET Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:40:35] <%CyberDingus> Tifa is mommy-ing you two
[0:40:35] <IntrepidEye> Her real personality is only being mildly thirsty
[0:40:37] <Sol_Install> tifa suck a mom
[0:40:37] <mapimb> she said that
[0:40:38] <+Neoripo> NO
[0:40:40] <rudiciuscaesar> sometimes people don't even want us to use special needs.
[0:40:41] <Sol_Install> such*
[0:40:41] <turbofolk> no
[0:40:45] <rudiciuscaesar> say special needs*
[0:40:51] <mapimb> awww
[0:40:51] <+CrimsonDio11> no this is all just for shits and giggles
[0:40:52] <+Neoripo> Tifa is winning!
[0:41:01] <oshkeet41> guys, its less about the word use and more the intensity of her tone
[0:41:07] <%JailShmixRemix> Barret ily hggGasm
[0:41:15] <CaptHat211> Tifa needed to have a personality more like Midna
[0:41:17] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, he literally does though, he's missing a hand.
[0:41:22] <+some_brave_apollo> he's got a very small head in proportion to his body
[0:41:22] <GeltonZ> @rudiciuscaesar We should stop using words and just grunt and hiss at eachother! :D
[0:41:24] <MKUltima> It was a weapon for Red XIII I think
[0:41:24] <GoopyEuclid> I mean, she could just call him a dumbass at that point or something
[0:41:27] <+Pyroclase> How is Barret not in amazing shape? He's a tank witha minigun for an arm.
[0:41:27] <mapimb> thought it was gonna be another gohan momeny
[0:41:37] <rudiciuscaesar> @GeltonZ people do that in my area for real lol.
[0:41:38] <mapimb> moment*
[0:41:40] <arkv01> keep an eye on that daddy booty
[0:41:43] <mrgaster8> hehe
[0:41:48] <GeltonZ> @rudiciuscaesar Oh. Oh I'm so sorry.
[0:41:51] <@Nightbot> @TreesDontTalk -> Terminated! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:41:52] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes Stairs = dialoge, elevator = cutscene + 2 fights
[0:41:58] <+Neoripo> Tifa in floor 30
[0:42:04] <rudiciuscaesar> I had a lady try to throw a 20 dollar bill at me at work cuz she didn't want to touch me, and I just laughed and then she growled like a dog, it's weird.
[0:42:15] <%JailShmixRemix> Bark
[0:42:17] <arkv01> but the best limit break was barrets level 3
[0:42:18] <+some_brave_apollo> that's the materia system for you
[0:42:30] <Owkono> cloud tifa barret was my team
[0:42:30] <GeltonZ> @rudiciuscaesar XD You know...I wonder...
[0:42:33] <+Risingxiv> That was my biggest issue with FF7, every character was the same until that one bar filled
[0:42:39] <MKUltima> Not his ultimate but one called Behemoth Horn apparently
[0:42:40] <BillieNoMates> Didn't most of the level 4s multi-hit?
[0:42:41] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> Cloud tifa vince was my dream team
[0:42:41] <rudiciuscaesar> legit dude. But then again, I work a gas station.
[0:42:44] <+Neoripo> Losing to Barret, for shame
[0:42:52] <arkv01> no, only cloud's did multi-hit IIRC
[0:42:56] <$doomp12> already winded? I guess you could say he can, Bare-ett, ha.
[0:42:56] <arkv01> and cid's highwind
[0:42:57] <rudiciuscaesar> I've had to kick out junkies, drunks, and now I have to call the police if someone without a mask comes in
[0:42:59] <CaptHat211> If you fall behind Tifa will yell "HURRY THE F*CK UP, YOU SLOWPOKE SPIKY-HAIRED R*TARD!"
[0:43:00] <Sol_Install> oh
[0:43:02] <oshkeet41> yup, means your muscles are gonna ache like hell after till the acid drains off your muscle
[0:43:06] <arkv01> barret's level 3 did like 20 hits though
[0:43:36] <rudiciuscaesar> Tifa can only hit like 9 times, right?
[0:43:44] <turbofolk> Game Audio is starting to sound like ass plague
[0:43:52] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats the game
[0:43:54] <+Neoripo> That is normal
[0:43:55] <rudiciuscaesar> Cid's hit like 18 times, but the damage is only like 60% of his normal hit.
[0:43:58] <OToole42> thats just the game
[0:43:58] <jiin6> thats intent
[0:43:59] <arkv01> I never used tifa, totally forgot LUL
[0:43:59] <+some_brave_apollo> oh jeez
[0:44:01] <oshkeet41> IIRC Yuffie and Rei had a weaker multihit that ended up being better
[0:44:03] <oshkeet41> *red
[0:44:10] <+CrimsonDio11> @turbofolk reset the twitch player
[0:44:11] <TheWe4pon> Man they better not fuck up Cid in this remake
[0:44:12] <Sokumotanaka> Wait it only starts to burn fat AFTER that!? I have to work harder?
[0:44:14] <MKUltima> Greased Lightning
[0:44:17] <BurdRightsActivist> Angermax is still the best, fuck Omnislash 4Head
[0:44:18] <oshkeet41> Doom of the Living?
[0:44:18] <+Neoripo> Cloud is tired
[0:44:20] <OToole42> lunatic rush
[0:44:22] <oshkeet41> one of those.
[0:44:22] <%Samex_Comex> I'm home!
[0:44:26] <OToole42> can't recall
[0:44:27] <+Neoripo> Music is getting tired
[0:44:28] <rudiciuscaesar> but if you get Cloud's attack to 255 and his strength to 255, you'd get 9999 with each Omnislash hit.
[0:44:30] <WoodenTarkus> Even the music is tired
[0:44:34] <turbofolk> Ah really
[0:44:35] <rudiciuscaesar> and Doom of the Living and Blood Harvest.
[0:44:36] <turbofolk> ?
[0:44:39] <rudiciuscaesar> for Yuffie.
[0:44:39] <ToeBeanHeaven> All you need for this part is Groose's Theme
[0:44:42] <ToeBeanHeaven> Perfect Fit.
[0:44:42] <kentrix11> No that's intended
[0:45:00] <TreesDontTalk> rendering 59 floors of stairs is hard
[0:45:01] <kentrix11> Oh hey Cloud admited he was trying to make a joke wow.
[0:45:08] <rudiciuscaesar> Yeah, one is just a more hitting version.
[0:45:12] <mapimb> gotta load all the padding with some walking
[0:45:20] <rudiciuscaesar> I think Doom of the Living hits like 10 times while Blood Harvest only hit like 5
[0:45:30] <BurdRightsActivist> more like Furrybrand am I right 4Head
[0:45:33] <ToeBeanHeaven> Why limit break when you can just Quad-Magic Knights of the Round with Mimic on your party Kappa ?
[0:45:33] <rudiciuscaesar> and Red's Stardust move...was it called Stardust?
[0:45:33] <+Neoripo> The stairs was in the original
[0:45:36] <rudiciuscaesar> I refuse to Wiki this.
[0:45:37] <IntrepidEye> The one thing I do really like in this is the occasional bouts of shit talking
[0:45:40] <CaptHat211> Hey Chat and Eli who is your favorite FF female character?
[0:45:42] <arkv01> stardust yeah
[0:45:45] <Sol_Install> this is just one giant loading screen tbh
[0:45:46] <+CrimsonDio11> man I just realized the stairs would be great for the spedometer materia
[0:46:02] <BillieNoMates> Barrets was definitely a multi-hit
[0:46:07] <rudiciuscaesar> @CaptHat211 Aeris is my waifu and I acknowledge that and accept that I have a problem.
[0:46:14] <Tommyrats> Yuffie is ez best ff7 girl
[0:46:15] <BurdRightsActivist> SAY THE LINE TIFA
[0:46:17] <rudiciuscaesar> Barret has 3 multi hit
[0:46:22] <examplez0> I want to hear Tifa call him a retard
[0:46:24] <+Neoripo> LUL
[0:46:29] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:46:29] <rudiciuscaesar> Ungermax, Satellite Beam and Catastrophe.
[0:46:37] <arkv01> barret's huffing and puffing is great here
[0:46:42] <ToeBeanHeaven> My favorite was/is Jessie >Elena > Yuffie.
[0:46:44] <SuperVaderMan> aw, cloud's gettin pooped
[0:46:45] <rudiciuscaesar> Vincent's limits are the WORST
[0:46:47] <OToole42> cloud looking tired, poor kid
[0:46:48] <TreesDontTalk> @capthat211 I like Lulu
[0:46:51] <turbofolk> Cloud is really slowing down
[0:46:51] <kingra> Put the sword down Cloud
[0:46:55] <arkv01> cloud you can't be tired, you're first class!
[0:46:58] <+HawkGoggles2> You should be able to run here this is odd.
[0:47:03] <+Pyroclase> he's holding his head lower, I think
[0:47:03] <MKUltima> I like Vincent's level 2 because you become Frankenstein
[0:47:11] <OToole42> he is slouched, throwing his arms more
[0:47:12] <%Samex_Comex> Me and my brother climbed up 47 stairs once, it sucked
[0:47:16] <rudiciuscaesar> well remember at the beginning, Cloud staggers when Sephiroth is screwing with him.
[0:47:19] <mapimb> @neoripo im pretty sure they took the elevator
[0:47:24] <arkv01> vincent's LB's weren't great for gameplay, but cool in concept
[0:47:25] <Sol_Install> @Samex_Comex why?
[0:47:32] <SuperVaderMan> Barret LUL
[0:47:33] <red_blaster> Vincent's limit break sucks because it lead to Dirge of Cerberus' plot
[0:47:39] <Huntercd> Vincen't limits were moster theme and took control way
[0:47:40] <mrgaster8> haha love it
[0:47:44] <%Samex_Comex> We thought we could beat the elevator to the top
[0:47:46] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao a sucking that keeps on giving.
[0:47:47] <kingra> Barret is SO GOOD in this game LUL
[0:47:54] <WoodenTarkus> The music LUL
[0:48:05] <arkv01> they had to mocap for tired barret LUL
[0:48:06] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, is he fucking singing?
[0:48:07] <mapimb> this is how they lose
[0:48:11] <turbofolk> This is great
[0:48:12] <Sol_Install> this the best part of the game
[0:48:18] <+Neoripo> Poor Barret
[0:48:24] <kentrix11> They can only load a lot to look this good.
[0:48:25] <arkv01> barret should just be belting out karaoke all the time
[0:48:26] <rudiciuscaesar> can't see those Dark Soul tree textures.
[0:48:26] <MKUltima> Stair Simulator VII
[0:48:40] <BillieNoMates> I don't think super soldiers would actually care about walking up stairs tho
[0:48:41] <BurdRightsActivist> SHE DIDN'T SAY THE LINE ):<<<
[0:48:44] <arkv01> was that actually 59 flights
[0:48:44] <rudiciuscaesar> why wasn't this just a cut scene?
[0:48:44] <CaptHat211> Tifa: *vomits*
[0:48:48] <BillieNoMates> Yes
[0:49:02] <mrgaster8> i didnt know this bir
[0:49:04] <TreesDontTalk> doodHey Retard
[0:49:05] <rudiciuscaesar> a 45 second one, like just show their feet, hauling ass, and have them give their dialogue.
[0:49:05] <mrgaster8> bit
[0:49:10] <oshkeet41> rudi: because the joke in the original is it was waste of time
[0:49:13] <IntrepidEye> I think she said something about you looking up her skirt maybe
[0:49:16] <WoodenTarkus> Didn't she say that to prevent you looking up her skirt?
[0:49:21] <oshkeet41> 'player, why didnt you just use the elvator'
[0:49:23] <red_blaster> I think it was becasue she was wearing a skirt, and the other two could look up?
[0:49:27] <Sokumotanaka> I think she's going "UGH GO ON!
[0:49:29] <rudiciuscaesar> HOOTERS
[0:49:31] <CaptHat211> There'd be an insufferable Kotaku article about it.
[0:49:32] <+some_brave_apollo> this is weird
[0:49:34] <rudiciuscaesar> wait
[0:49:35] <Huntercd> Someone call HR
[0:49:36] <%CyberDingus> I WANT TO TAKE HIS PLACE
[0:49:36] <turbofolk> AH yeah mommy scarlet
[0:49:36] <BillieNoMates> He got his dream job
[0:49:36] <BurdRightsActivist> look at me i'm evil tifa, I have TITS TOO
[0:49:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Of course Scarlet has a big dumb chair.
[0:49:38] <rudiciuscaesar> was he getting a rectal exam!?
[0:49:44] <+HawkGoggles2> I'm Scarlet I also have big boobs I'm into S&M
[0:49:44] <rudiciuscaesar> Ohhhhhh
[0:49:46] <+Neoripo> He LOVES it!
[0:49:49] <Sokumotanaka> Of course
[0:49:51] <SupportWriter> We can't sexualize Tifa, but she's okay!
[0:49:51] <arkv01> YES MAAM
[0:49:51] <oshkeet41> At least Scarlet's already leaned hard into the Anime Villain thing back in OG.
[0:49:51] <GoopyEuclid> Christ that evil lady looks so fucking evil
[0:49:55] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Wait, is she resting her feet on somebody?
[0:50:04] <%CyberDingus> good lord
[0:50:05] <arkv01> that LUCKY GRUNT
[0:50:07] <+Neoripo> yes
[0:50:10] <%CyberDingus> lucky security guy
[0:50:11] <rudiciuscaesar> these guys are comically evil, like I can't take them serious.
[0:50:17] <rudiciuscaesar> at least President Shinra is just Stalin.
[0:50:19] <mapimb> Tifa gonna have an adult gohan moment
[0:50:20] <arkv01> guy on the console is mad jelly
[0:50:20] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> how the fuck does shinra function as a company with such psychotic uncaring people running it
[0:50:22] <turbofolk> She looks like she would she would tease your tiny penis like in a redmoa animatio
[0:50:23] <BillieNoMates> She was always just sorta there
[0:50:32] <TreesDontTalk> Need that FF7R Part 5 with that Tifa v Scarlet slap match!
[0:50:32] <rudiciuscaesar> she's getting off to this
[0:50:33] <+HawkGoggles2> That cat fight was worthless but it was there.
[0:50:34] <BillieNoMates> errrrrrr
[0:50:35] <+some_brave_apollo> I don't even remember what her job is
[0:50:40] <WoodenTarkus> @fillmydarksoulwithlight You say that as if that doesn't happen constantly IRL
[0:50:41] <%CyberDingus> ouch
[0:50:42] <BillieNoMates> Welp, summon materia busted
[0:50:44] <BurdRightsActivist> GONNA CUM ON THOSE MATERIA
[0:50:45] <TechDragon_Z> I remember that slapfight. Somehow, Tifa can lose that.
[0:50:47] <rudiciuscaesar> THAT GUY DID NOTHING TO HER, it wasn't his fault.
[0:50:48] <CaptHat211> Harry Kim?
[0:50:49] <Sokumotanaka> She dies too
[0:50:50] <kentrix11> I like how they made her as campy a villain as before, just sadist evil.
[0:50:51] <ZE_Count> Still crawling
[0:50:57] <BillieNoMates> hahaha
[0:50:57] <GoopyEuclid> Oh no Mewtwo's gonna escape
[0:50:58] <+Neoripo> LUL
[0:50:58] <rudiciuscaesar> wow that voice did not fit that guys face
[0:51:00] <+claudesavegely> just in case you didn't realize she's EVIL
[0:51:01] <IntrepidEye> I think they planned on her having a boss fight in this but cut it.
[0:51:01] <arkv01> WHY IS HE STILL CRAWLING
[0:51:01] <kingra> LUL
[0:51:02] <%CyberDingus> the doggy guy
[0:51:04] <oshkeet41> I mean her whole thing was being the only lady baddie on the team of big shinra bodies, standard anime dickflattener noblewoman.
[0:51:07] <Sokumotanaka> Mewtwo agan
[0:51:10] <Sokumotanaka> XDDD
[0:51:16] <+whiskey_wolfe_> This hall looks like all the other halls.
[0:51:17] <%CyberDingus> I would not wash my back for a week after that
[0:51:22] <+Neoripo> He LOVES it!
[0:51:22] <turbofolk> HE HAS TOO
[0:51:24] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes he is now
[0:51:24] <gnollAUS> It's job
[0:51:25] <arkv01> actually it's a pretty good job...
[0:51:25] <rudiciuscaesar> oh wait are these real plants!?
[0:51:25] <Sokumotanaka> It wasn't human it was a bitch
[0:51:25] <ZE_Count> Dont kinkshame
[0:51:27] <BurdRightsActivist> woof woof me soldier step on me
[0:51:27] <TreesDontTalk> FrankerZ
[0:51:28] <SuperVaderMan> cartoon villain wasting the lives of their underlings, good
[0:51:28] <TechDragon_Z> His rank is mutt.
[0:51:28] <jggoryl> crawling is in his contract
[0:51:31] <Nenatab> I would hesitate to call someone willingly doing that human.
[0:51:32] <ToeBeanHeaven> AT LEAST....With the Existence of FF7R there is a shooting star's worth of hope that they'll remake Parasite Eve Kreygasm
[0:51:34] <rudiciuscaesar> thought Shinra couldn't grow them
[0:51:35] <MrHappyFunshine> oh hi doggy
[0:51:35] <ToeBeanHeaven> That's the GOOD shit.
[0:51:36] <arkv01> good benefits, fun hours...
[0:51:38] <$jamarartdoodles> Dickflattening
[0:51:41] <Sokumotanaka> That's all he knows now @PlagueOfGripes
[0:51:48] <turbofolk> LOOK HOE HARD OUR ARTISTS WORKED
[0:51:49] <rudiciuscaesar> Parasite Eve would also be nothing but fetish fan fiction in reality
[0:51:49] <ZE_Count> I hope he got kneepads.
[0:51:58] <CaptHat211> Barret: "Damn fools. I pity them."
[0:52:03] <ToeBeanHeaven> Couldn't be any worse than 3rd birthday
[0:52:06] <BurdRightsActivist> HOE HARD
[0:52:12] <MKUltima> Would a Regen Ring in this setting offset Arthritis
[0:52:24] <arkv01> encouraging NG+ I guess
[0:52:29] <Victory_Boss> Was there a dude in the seat back there?
[0:52:30] <+Neoripo> I think you can buy it later
[0:52:36] <WoodenTarkus> What is he talking about?
[0:52:38] <kentrix11> That's very FF7-ish.
[0:52:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Shut up this game is GREAT.
[0:52:43] <rudiciuscaesar> that's why the added that chapter select, was probably a last minute add on
[0:52:47] <+stephane3012> NO GOING BACKSIES
[0:52:50] <BurdRightsActivist> 77/10 Genius Nonumbo
[0:52:51] <TreesDontTalk> rEplAyABiliTy pLaGue
[0:52:53] <IntrepidEye> Wait until you hear about how obnoxious the 100% runs are
[0:52:54] <BillieNoMates> Information areas I assume
[0:52:54] <arkv01> but yeah OG ff7 had stuff lying on the ground you could just miss, like barrets ultimate weapon
[0:52:59] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes btw there is a weapon on the mayor's floor. will explain later
[0:53:12] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I may be wrong, but i think you can actually buy it later
[0:53:14] <GeltonZ> @WoodenTarkus There was a Tifa platforming section that had a hidden weapon in it and he can't go back.
[0:53:15] <MKUltima> "Beginning colon scan, please remain still."
[0:53:19] <SlimeBoogey> kiosk
[0:53:23] <kentrix11> Honestly that's just bad regardless of if the OG did it.
[0:53:38] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, are you guys serious about a weapon for him to get? If so, pop off when he's getting close, remember the Twitch delay.
[0:53:41] <turbofolk> oh hey those NPC's wont question strangers walking around
[0:53:41] <+some_brave_apollo> mass effect kind of thing
[0:53:43] <GeltonZ> @Neoripo Well this is pretty much the end of the game now.
[0:53:43] <BurdRightsActivist> HOLOGRAMS??
[0:53:44] <rudiciuscaesar> and this hologram is bullshit
[0:53:44] <FinchBot> i like this song, dunno if it fits tho
[0:53:51] <+Pyroclase> just say 60-63
[0:53:52] <Sokumotanaka> You only get in deeper if you say a sick burn that gets you alot of poggers
[0:53:58] <TreesDontTalk> Friggin Red Queen over here
[0:53:59] <+Neoripo> yep
[0:54:03] <GeltonZ> @rudiciuscaesar They tried.
[0:54:04] <+claudesavegely> security is important
[0:54:06] <Sokumotanaka> Id hit it
[0:54:06] <arkv01> holo alexa
[0:54:07] <Huntercd> Why does she have pixie cut?
[0:54:09] <kentrix11> It's just a recorded message.
[0:54:09] <BillieNoMates> Yes. It's about making shit as inefficient as possible
[0:54:10] <WoodenTarkus> LUL
[0:54:14] <BurdRightsActivist> Padding, Berret
[0:54:18] <oshkeet41> Barret has some great meta-lines
[0:54:19] <+Neoripo> you will see
[0:54:20] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao Robot Masters show up
[0:54:22] <ZE_Count> I remember Red human grandpa had a hologram of the solar system or somthing.
[0:54:31] <+Neoripo> It makes sense
[0:54:39] <jiin6> JRPG
[0:54:40] <mrgaster8> have fun plague this bit is a grind
[0:54:40] <BurdRightsActivist> Game's perfect btw
[0:54:41] <BillieNoMates> But FF7 had shitloads of "padding" to get through the upper levels
[0:54:44] <arkv01> their sticking that padded first right up our poopers
[0:54:44] <kentrix11> I mean I do remember the Shinra building being fairly long.
[0:54:54] <turbofolk> Remember this is NOT PADDING according to max
[0:55:03] <oshkeet41> Padding is weird cause if you wanted to delay the player, all you did was add rewards to the bullshit to tempt you into doing it. not just force em to do it.
[0:55:04] <yodajr99> hey plague how are you liking this game?
[0:55:09] <WoodenTarkus> How is this padding lol
[0:55:18] <examplez0> To be fair this is the first time the padding has been accurate to the original
[0:55:19] <TreesDontTalk> 1 Midgar Puzzle Room
[0:55:20] <ZE_Count> I liked the shinra propaganda
[0:55:21] <rudiciuscaesar> it's super dark, kinda wish more lights were on.
[0:55:22] <+Neoripo> It's not padding really
[0:55:31] <TreesDontTalk> and the vent room
[0:55:35] <WoodenTarkus> Let's add new content to a 30 hour game because we HAVE to extend it by 1 hour or people will complain
[0:55:39] <TreesDontTalk> and the Mayor riddle floor
[0:55:46] <+some_brave_apollo> How is it not padding? The entire game is padding out a six hour segment
[0:55:47] <examplez0> I'm still pissed off by how long the train graveyard dragged on for
[0:55:52] <rudiciuscaesar> oh shit, there's the theme.
[0:55:52] <examplez0> And the sewer levels
[0:56:08] <jggoryl> ah let the nostalgia flow
[0:56:12] <red_blaster> This game should have been 15 hours long, but then people would complain
[0:56:17] <rudiciuscaesar> the Train Graveyard really hung it up
[0:56:36] <rudiciuscaesar> it was too long, you have a major emergency to deal with but first, DO THIS DUNGEON
[0:56:40] <examplez0> QUICK WE HAVE TO SAVE EVERYONE IN SECTOR 7 BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
[0:56:43] <+some_brave_apollo> it shocked me, the train graveyard was just two screens before
[0:56:44] <turbofolk> How did pat ACTUALLY reacted to them ghosts tho
[0:56:44] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes So are you gonna join pat and woolie for that spoilcast on this game?
[0:56:50] <examplez0> But first let's hang out with ghost children
[0:56:56] <+some_brave_apollo> or three., maybe
[0:56:58] <examplez0> Because we have to
[0:56:59] <+Neoripo> There is no padding in the Shinra building until a VERY SPECIFIC point
[0:57:06] <WoodenTarkus> Frankly they should have removed everything but the cutscenes, the video game part is padding doodSmug
[0:57:06] <turbofolk> in stream he was positive about them just to piss us off
[0:57:13] <rudiciuscaesar> the Train Graveyard could have been how they got out of Sector 7.
[0:57:16] <arkv01> I don't think woolie's started on this yet
[0:57:17] <SlimeBoogey> to be honest this game could've EASILY gone up to the junon boat
[0:57:19] <examplez0> That's a preety flimsy reason
[0:57:20] <+Pyroclase> He clearly was, they can see the platform explodinbg
[0:57:25] <examplez0> Exactly lol
[0:57:25] <SupportWriter> Pat got a copy from se so I bet he can't voice his disdain
[0:57:29] <rudiciuscaesar> like, when the plate fell, that could be where they were forced to evacuate through.
[0:57:44] <SlimeBoogey> the "added sections" of midgar were honestly not that substantial
[0:57:46] <+Neoripo> Yeah, train graveyard destroys pacing sadly
[0:57:49] <examplez0> Pat going out of this way to shill this game no matter how much he denies it
[0:57:49] <mrgaster8> why not
[0:57:53] <Sokumotanaka> They should
[0:57:53] <TreesDontTalk> Elmo is a guest on the podcast
[0:57:55] <turbofolk> Woolie is too busy on dokapon to care aboutany other game
[0:57:58] <BurdRightsActivist> You heard it from plague, no Podcast guests allowed. Confirmed
[0:58:00] <rudiciuscaesar> Train Simulation sounds...nefarious
[0:58:02] <kentrix11> Wait isn't the whole graveyard bit that Ghosts literally don't wanna let you go and you don't kill them cause they are children and Aerith is being nice tot hem?
[0:58:03] <BillieNoMates> Woolie has the best taste
[0:58:05] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> no guests anymore not after last time lol
[0:58:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> Floor 49 has training "holo suite"
[0:58:07] <SlimeBoogey> all they did was pad out sections that normally took 20-30 minutes and turned it into a 2 hour dungeon
[0:58:07] <MrHappyFunshine> Yeah SOLDIER have a holodeck
[0:58:09] <BillieNoMates> Pat is a consoomer
[0:58:14] <+BigCoffee> Pat enjoys dumb things
[0:58:14] <BurdRightsActivist> "Pat doesn't think" you're right.
[0:58:21] <yodajr99> pat thinks with his goblins
[0:58:22] <Sol_Install> yep
[0:58:22] <arkv01> he consume product
[0:58:23] <jiin6> pat liked RE3remake
[0:58:23] <+some_brave_apollo> Pat's opinion of this is bizarre to me because he thinks its like Eva Rebuild, and he hates Eva Rebuild
[0:58:24] <arkv01> and poops
[0:58:24] <terminusterminal> Consoomer
[0:58:28] <%CyberDingus> he consooms
[0:58:29] <arkv01> coomsoomer
[0:58:40] <TreesDontTalk> Consume product. Look forward to consume more product.
[0:58:40] <ZE_Count> hologram gave ya card for the doors so you can do the tour
[0:58:41] <turbofolk> Frankly i stopped caring about it im sick of dokapon
[0:58:44] <BillieNoMates> Woolie just grades things on the waifus
[0:58:48] <GeltonZ> Give them time. Give them ALL time.
[0:58:49] <dildozerfred> Conboomer? LUL
[0:58:50] <BurdRightsActivist> So what you're saying is Virgin Pat vs Chad Woolie?
[0:58:54] <Livelinne> woolieSMUG
[0:59:03] <Sol_Install> Dokapon was so good today
[0:59:07] <examplez0> Too bad for Woolie that Yuffie doesn't appear this episode
[0:59:15] <TreesDontTalk> CON brucegBoomer
[0:59:23] <arkv01> what's the dokapon blood pool up to?
[0:59:23] <+Neoripo> Red means nono
[0:59:30] <jiin6> good for woolie he doesn't go to jail
[0:59:31] <Sol_Install> I swear they made the 10th level of hell with so much salt today
[0:59:32] <BurdRightsActivist> @Sol_Install How far behind is Dokapon on the channel?
[0:59:32] <Shwepie> Is Woolie really falling into the Dokapon hole?
[0:59:46] <rudiciuscaesar> well, @PlagueOfGripes you're also an artist, you break things down from an artist's standpoint, like, all your old how to really draw videos or whatnot. That's just my opinion, I too, live off filthy art commissions, so i know where you're coming from.
[0:59:47] <Sol_Install> @BurdRightsActivist pretty far
[0:59:50] <Futurecity10> well yes, the blood pool is like 1k now
[0:59:51] <turbofolk> Hes been at it for like 2 damn months now
[0:59:52] <arkv01> I dunno I expected more security TBH
[0:59:53] <BillieNoMates> Barret has never held a job
[1:00:00] <BillieNoMates> He's just been a perpetual rebel
[1:00:02] <GeltonZ> @Shwepie Yup. People are loving it. They're donating money as a prize for whoever wins.
[1:00:03] <yodajr99> whats the name of this track
[1:00:06] <+Neoripo> Missed the escalator
[1:00:10] <+some_brave_apollo> its a bit late in the story for Barret to backtrack on his opinion of Cloud
[1:00:11] <examplez0> He's a professional token
[1:00:11] <rudiciuscaesar> Yes, that's what I meant.
[1:00:16] <+claudesavegely> I remember working in an office and having to deal with getting a keycard and updating permissions and bullshit
[1:00:17] <TheWe4pon> are there vocals playing?
[1:00:28] <arkv01> yeah this bgm track is hella smooth
[1:00:32] <+CrimsonDio11> so are you saying that all artists are assholes? Kappa
[1:00:33] <Lobster_Lord> @BillieNoMates Shinra killed his family and destroyed his whole village
[1:00:34] <rudiciuscaesar> @PlagueOfGripes sorry, I meant it that way. Your natural disposition led you to that.
[1:00:41] <Shwepie> @GeltonZ Shame it will be a year or more before it ends. The campaign is... insane.
[1:00:44] <Futurecity10> I've started valuing woolies opinion on stuff more than pat recently
[1:00:50] <arkv01> heeey its our boy
[1:00:59] <examplez0> She's cute
[1:01:03] <rudiciuscaesar> sorry, I'm tired as hell, no word form good.
[1:01:06] <arkv01> reeves has a hottie thotty?
[1:01:07] <EliahNebb> tags: office lady
[1:01:09] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Look at this necessary scene
[1:01:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> Good guy Reeve
[1:01:10] <rudiciuscaesar> FURSONA
[1:01:11] <BillieNoMates> Excuses. Tifa owns a bar
[1:01:21] <+Neoripo> Reeve is a good man
[1:01:23] <TreesDontTalk> Cloud and friends running around all these normal ass folk has the same energy as Mario running around normal folk in New Donk City
[1:01:28] <Huntercd> Why does reeves wait so long do he his job?
[1:01:30] <oshkeet41> beat the humdum bordeom of coperate life by building your own heroic fursona
[1:01:32] <+claudesavegely> TEN BILLION GIL
[1:01:38] <ToeBeanHeaven> Reeve "I wish I was a fucking cat" Tuesti.
[1:01:41] <Sokumotanaka> Did you know TIFA OWNS A BAR AND WE'RE THE PHANTOM THEIVES!?
[1:01:47] <rudiciuscaesar> WOW, her mouth moves awful!
[1:01:51] <VERDAXY> shes a spy
[1:01:52] <yodajr99> @huntercd do he his job?
[1:02:04] <Huntercd> His dumb ass should have had inspections long before this
[1:02:04] <arkv01> that unbuttoned collar is telling me she definitely fuckin him
[1:02:05] <BillieNoMates> He's perving on the assistant
[1:02:07] <MrHappyFunshine> I can't help but analyse everything
[1:02:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> Mayor Domino's Pizza
[1:02:10] <ThatGuyThere03> fuck yeah
[1:02:12] <GeltonZ> OH YEAH! Max actually came up with reason for Cait Sith to be in that cutscene with the dropping of the plate: Reeve was using it to try and stop the plate behind the scenes. It's a good excuse.
[1:02:16] <turbofolk> Boi she really is NPC lady she is meant to say more dialogue beyond that
[1:02:21] <BillieNoMates> Inb4 the Mayor is Sephiroth
[1:02:31] <%Samex_Comex> Yay Dinosaurs
[1:02:34] <BillieNoMates> A MUSUEM
[1:02:35] <BurdRightsActivist> IT'S THE GACKT MUSUEM
[1:02:35] <BillieNoMates> TO THE MAN
[1:02:37] <arkv01> pure gold huh
[1:02:38] <mrgaster8> cuz wha not
[1:02:39] <%Samex_Comex> Awww
[1:02:39] <ZE_Count> Time for that sweet sweet propaganda
[1:02:39] <+Neoripo> YEP
[1:02:40] <+claudesavegely> so shinra can flaunt his massive throbbing ego
[1:02:40] <turbofolk> @GeltonZ Oh thats trash fuck off max
[1:02:40] <fuu_underrated> movie time
[1:02:41] <GeltonZ> As a side note, Dirge of Cerberus may have just turned Cait Sith and Reeve into my favorite characters.
[1:02:43] <rudiciuscaesar> A perfect, golden man!
[1:02:45] <red_blaster> There is a Final Fantasy X easter egg in the picture with the group of founders
[1:02:47] <+HawkGoggles2> Barret: Fuck all of this.
[1:02:50] <ToeBeanHeaven> Now Museum, now you don't Kappa
[1:02:50] <Sokumotanaka> So he can sniff his balls
[1:02:54] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, memorial museum, he isn't dead.
[1:02:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> imagine DIO's museum
[1:02:54] <TechDragon_Z> The Hall of Narcissism
[1:02:55] <OToole42> shoot the knees barret!
[1:03:01] <tolloponik> pleas fight the gold statue
[1:03:09] <GeltonZ> @turbofolk Hey! It makes it slightly less stupid! I'll take what I can get because BOY was that scene so stupid it was Sonic!
[1:03:10] <+Pyroclase> wouldn't the statue be of a younger version of him?
[1:03:17] <+Pyroclase> He seems too vain to include the wrinkles
[1:03:23] <arkv01> @GeltonZ that makes more sense than anything, I like it better than juts random robocat watching plate fall
[1:03:25] <ToeBeanHeaven> President Shinra - "I invented GUN."
[1:03:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Piss, shit and CUM on his floors. DOIT
[1:03:32] <rudiciuscaesar> the Mayor is clearly just a Civil War General.
[1:03:35] <examplez0> Mayor: "Can you believe this shit?"
[1:03:36] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes there's a picture in this room you should take a long look at
[1:03:37] <%Samex_Comex> Geese?
[1:03:45] <GeltonZ> @arkv01 Exactly! Max is a high level apologist at the very least so kudos on that one!
[1:03:47] <+Neoripo> ye
[1:03:50] <rudiciuscaesar> oh is that Midgar on it?
[1:03:50] <TreesDontTalk> Picturing Cloud and President Shinra ripping off their shirts to expose their fully tattooed backs to have a Yakuza style fistfight at the top of Shinra tower
[1:03:55] <Monstergelo> if it is off hour why the power still on?
[1:03:55] <Sokumotanaka> Cait sith's coffin
[1:03:56] <BillieNoMates> Some award for killing the planet
[1:03:57] <+some_brave_apollo> it's SYMBOLIC because Shinra are killing the planet
[1:03:57] <TonberryLives> What the hell LUL
[1:03:57] <examplez0> The coffin is very appropriate symbolism
[1:03:58] <rudiciuscaesar> like the seal looks like Midgar from the bird's eye
[1:03:59] <BillieNoMates> What a true honour
[1:04:00] <ThatGuyThere03> now go look at the baby shoes
[1:04:07] <BillieNoMates> LAVOS?
[1:04:11] <rudiciuscaesar> the first Mako drill
[1:04:13] <fatalDestiny> Drill bit?
[1:04:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> drill bit
[1:04:16] <rudiciuscaesar> drill bit.
[1:04:17] <Fredcome2bed> drill
[1:04:27] <BillieNoMates> Preisdent Shinra
[1:04:30] <+BigCoffee> rufus
[1:04:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's Rufus
[1:04:33] <GeltonZ> @TreesDontTalk I wish Tifa would rip her shirt off and have-HOLY CRAP YES! DO THE SLAP FIGHT SHIRTLESS IN THE RAIN!
[1:04:36] <rudiciuscaesar> That's supposed to be Shinra himself!?
[1:04:38] <mrgaster8> their more
[1:04:38] <Fredcome2bed> modest beginnings
[1:04:43] <+Neoripo> Totally Shinra
[1:04:43] <BillieNoMates> Nah. he's using it right. He's a TF2 grade engineer
[1:04:47] <ZE_Count> I DID THIS
[1:04:50] <BurdRightsActivist> "tools used by SHINRA HIMSELF"
[1:04:54] <red_blaster> You can see Shinra from Final Fantasy X in one of the pictures, making the VII and X connection canon
[1:05:00] <ZE_Count> Theres ffx2 shinra
[1:05:00] <+Neoripo> Museum continues
[1:05:03] <+some_brave_apollo> oh easter egg photo
[1:05:05] <examplez0> COME SEE THE GOLDEN TOILET PAPER OUR PRESIDENT WIPED HIS ASS WITH
[1:05:05] <+HawkGoggles2> All of the money went to the gold statue.
[1:05:06] <Livelinne> LUL
[1:05:07] <TreesDontTalk> @geltonz doodGood
[1:05:10] <GeltonZ> @red_blaster Wait really?!
[1:05:11] <GiygasDrillBreak> that was a joke, red, dev said it was a silly name reference
[1:05:12] <+claudesavegely> is that wesker?
[1:05:13] <BillieNoMates> Gas mask?
[1:05:14] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Why is there Wutai stuff here when Wutai is the enemy?
[1:05:19] <BillieNoMates> Gask mask
[1:05:24] <examplez0> That's a FFX-2 reference
[1:05:24] <+HotBloodedHero> This is the best shitty museum I've seen in a while
[1:05:26] <GeltonZ> @whiskey_wolfe_ War trophies
[1:05:26] <+some_brave_apollo> i think its meant to be to the X2 guy
[1:05:29] <BurdRightsActivist> Look harder, you'll see GACKT
[1:05:30] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes You want to know who that mask guy is?
[1:05:31] <ZE_Count> FFX-2 Shinra
[1:05:34] <MrHappyFunshine> FFX-2
[1:05:34] <BurdRightsActivist> REFELENCE
[1:05:36] <red_blaster> Gas mask kid is a Final Fantasy X-2 character
[1:05:37] <turbofolk> LOOK AT THAT MOTHERFUCKER IN THE GAS MASK HOLY SHIT
[1:05:39] <BillieNoMates> Its FFX-2 plague
[1:05:40] <BurdRightsActivist> FFX-2 SHINRA
[1:05:45] <examplez0> According to Nojima, FFX and VII share the same universe
[1:05:45] <BillieNoMates> Shinra was in that too
[1:05:49] <Huntercd> That makes no sense
[1:05:51] <BillieNoMates> What
[1:05:55] <oshkeet41> thats a joke, not canon
[1:05:55] <Daigrey> FFX-2 Shinra
[1:05:56] <BillieNoMates> Is that true?
[1:05:56] <+Neoripo> It's progress
[1:05:56] <examplez0> Yep
[1:06:00] <Futurecity10> Plague, that picture makes this game a sequel to FF10
[1:06:03] <BillieNoMates> Thats stupid
[1:06:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's a joke
[1:06:10] <Huntercd> FFX had a more advance world
[1:06:11] <rudiciuscaesar> Sorry, what did I miss, my mum needed me. Wait, Mask?
[1:06:14] <rudiciuscaesar> al-Bhed!?!?
[1:06:15] <examplez0> Yeah you're better off not knowing
[1:06:21] <MrHappyFunshine> there was a kid called Shinra in FFX-2 who is canonically the ancestor to the Shinra family
[1:06:23] <turbofolk> @Futurecity10 NO fuck off that can't be true
[1:06:24] <Futurecity10> Shinra from FF10 was in that picture
[1:06:25] <oshkeet41> folks gotta learn what's a cute funny ref and whats intended as serious canon
[1:06:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> at least this HQ has more than 2 elevators
[1:06:28] <+jiggy_snipe> that's probably a joke reference because that's too stupid
[1:06:29] <rudiciuscaesar> May Yevon spit on their graves, bruddah
[1:06:35] <+claudesavegely> SHIT GAME
[1:06:39] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:06:46] <ThatGuyThere03> that's a safety hazard
[1:06:47] <+stratibario> saaaaaame
[1:06:47] <%caramello_man> it should let you go down but you don;t move
[1:06:49] <BillieNoMates> Kojima would allow it and have you prat fall
[1:07:06] <BillieNoMates> Kojima should make a Final Fantasy
[1:07:11] <ThatGuyThere03> cloud is afraid of them
[1:07:13] <SlimeBoogey> do you have 10,000 gil to spare plague?
[1:07:14] <arkv01> clodd its absolutely okay to ride the escalatorin the wrong direction
[1:07:18] <examplez0> According to the FFVII Ultimania Omega it's true
[1:07:24] <mrgaster8> face first
[1:07:27] <%Samex_Comex> Don't get you shoelace stuck
[1:07:28] <SlimeBoogey> you'll need it for the next missable weapon
[1:07:29] <+CrimsonDio11> plague you have to go through the museum
[1:07:35] <BillieNoMates> Well it is Asia-tech. Im sure people have seen those webms of chinese escalators
[1:07:35] <ThatGuyThere03> dude have you seen when an escalator fucks up?
[1:07:39] <ThatGuyThere03> shit's scary
[1:07:43] <ZE_Count> gotta finish the tour
[1:07:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> escalators are fatal machines, no joke
[1:07:51] <mrgaster8> it is
[1:07:56] <BillieNoMates> They consume people for lubricant
[1:07:59] <+claudesavegely> gotta save aerith but first CHECK OUT THE EGO ROOM
[1:08:17] <rudiciuscaesar> oof, inauspicious to bring up those escalator accidents. Bad luck.
[1:08:28] <+Neoripo> It's actually pretty important
[1:08:42] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, hitboxes
[1:08:48] <turbofolk> Yakuza is like that too
[1:08:59] <BillieNoMates> recruitment?
[1:09:05] <mrgaster8> u will later
[1:09:06] <BillieNoMates> We can rejoin!
[1:09:19] <BillieNoMates> awww
[1:09:23] <BillieNoMates> Recreation :(
[1:09:26] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao where's HR
[1:09:27] <+CrimsonDio11> so what happens is you have to conduct a tour of the floors you're going up
[1:09:34] <+Neoripo> There are things on the floors, behid the keycard doors
[1:09:35] <BillieNoMates> theres no HR in Shinra
[1:09:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> Turks are HR
[1:09:37] <GoopyEuclid> But plague u don't get it it's supposed to be a metaphor for opulence and excess. /s
[1:09:40] <BillieNoMates> Fuck relations
[1:09:48] <+claudesavegely> SNN
[1:09:52] <rudiciuscaesar> the Turks are HR, holy shit, that's great, that's so true.
[1:09:55] <BillieNoMates> Probably too close to CNN
[1:09:56] <BurdRightsActivist> SIN
[1:10:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> Shinra Information Network, Shinra News Network
[1:10:11] <rudiciuscaesar> SIN = Shadoloo Intelligence Network?
[1:10:11] <arkv01> SIN is too on the nose I guess LUL
[1:10:24] <ZE_Count> Shinra News Network and Entertainment?
[1:10:33] <Huntercd> Why do these rich fucks care about the slums?
[1:10:34] <+some_brave_apollo> yeah but it is convenient
[1:10:41] <+claudesavegely> it was a convenient scapegoat
[1:10:43] <+BigCoffee> yeah but letting actual avalanche alive is still kinda dangerous
[1:10:45] <examplez0> Was it ever explained why there was a war with Wutai in the first place?
[1:10:55] <rudiciuscaesar> I think they would just make moves against Wutai again.
[1:10:56] <BillieNoMates> No. They already planned to move to Neo Midgard
[1:10:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> dont forget, there's TWO Avalanches, Shinra wants both hated by the public
[1:10:59] <BillieNoMates> gar*
[1:11:01] <+BigCoffee> @examplez0 I think it is in Crisis Core
[1:11:10] <+some_brave_apollo> yeah they're going to do Buenos Aires next
[1:11:15] <+Neoripo> For those who don't know, OG FF7 also had a lot of floors you could go by but not enter because you did not have the correct keycard
[1:11:16] <rudiciuscaesar> cuz Shinra never actually got possession of the land, they won, but not an unconditional win
[1:11:19] <IntrepidEye> There was still that other Avalanche cell that randomly popped up that one time
[1:11:20] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't ask question consoom product
[1:11:31] <+HotBloodedHero> They control the media, so they'd just blow it up anyway and blame it on them anyway
[1:11:41] <rudiciuscaesar> Pre-Crisis....
[1:12:08] <rudiciuscaesar> 60?
[1:12:11] <+Neoripo> Makes more sense then just 4 people
[1:12:18] <rudiciuscaesar> the floor with hologram girl? Is that right?
[1:12:22] <Sokumotanaka> Like the end of the dark brotherhood in skyrim
[1:12:26] <Lobster_Lord> FF7 is a pro terrorist game
[1:12:39] <tolloponik> I feel that they found out about berrets avalanche and used them as a controlled device to give the proper avalanche bad pr
[1:12:47] <ZE_Count> must consume propaganda
[1:12:49] <%caramello_man> FF7 encourages global terrorism
[1:12:51] <Jigokuro> bitterLurk
[1:12:58] <ZE_Count> go back
[1:13:02] <peachteagaming> can i rub your head?
[1:13:08] <kentrix11> Man going from Max's stream to this one is giving me whiplash, this one is overlly negative and the other one overlly positive.
[1:13:09] <+CrimsonDio11> floor 60 is the museum
[1:13:19] <examplez0> Yep exactly
[1:13:22] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, I agree with Plague.
[1:13:24] <rudiciuscaesar> Fan fiction.
[1:13:26] <suitangi021> gakt fanfic
[1:13:26] <kingra> Yep
[1:13:27] <+Neoripo> Plague can't stop avoiding the museum
[1:13:29] <kentrix11> Fanfiction from the creators?
[1:13:29] <arkv01> the turks stuff is pretty good though
[1:13:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Genius NONUMBO
[1:13:40] <%Samex_Comex> Can I be in it too?
[1:13:44] <rudiciuscaesar> I only think FF7 and Advent Children are canon. Well, Crisis Core is at least a fun game.
[1:13:50] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @kentrix11 but that's the best part
[1:13:51] <ZE_Count> memorial the one you want
[1:13:55] <jiin6> ah yes remake is defined as fanfiction, brilliant
[1:14:00] <examplez0> They did the exact same thing to FF10 with the blitzball bomb story
[1:14:04] <Lobster_Lord> fuck advent children
[1:14:05] <+Pyroclase> You're in the Shinra building
[1:14:11] <suitangi021> @rudiciuscaesar Modulating phase was fub?
[1:14:15] <+Neoripo> Plague got lost in the mall AGAIN
[1:14:25] <BillieNoMates> remake takes Compilation into it's plot. It's already fanfiction.
[1:14:25] <examplez0> Advent Children is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, no hyperbole
[1:14:26] <mrgaster8> your going backwards
[1:14:26] <rudiciuscaesar> kinda. It was fresh back then
[1:14:32] <examplez0> And I say that as a huge FF7 stan
[1:14:38] <ZE_Count> 60
[1:14:40] <BillieNoMates> I think FF7 being FFX is actually less retarded than compilation
[1:14:42] <rudiciuscaesar> oh yeah, Advent Children is FAN SERVICE.
[1:14:42] <%caramello_man> archives
[1:14:57] <rudiciuscaesar> but it has more of a connection than Crisis Core does.
[1:15:02] <Shwepie> @examplez0 Worse than Final Fantasy: Spirits Within?
[1:15:04] <rudiciuscaesar> like, Angeal, FUCK Angeal.
[1:15:06] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Enter the museum Plague
[1:15:20] <rudiciuscaesar> lol I saw Spirits Within on OPENING day
[1:15:23] <rudiciuscaesar> it was....
[1:15:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> he's trying to find the museum lol
[1:15:27] <rudiciuscaesar> "memorable."
[1:15:34] <jiin6> worse than the FFXV movie?
[1:15:40] <suitangi021> Ypu mean turning the buster sword into a regift
[1:15:48] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's not supposed to be fancy
[1:15:54] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, fuck Angeal
[1:15:57] <rudiciuscaesar> and his two white wings!
[1:15:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> OG shinra building had hokiness to it
[1:16:04] <mrgaster8> this one
[1:16:08] <examplez0> @Shwepie Spirits Within was just bland, generic and boring
[1:16:11] <Sokumotanaka> It doesn't but we have those irl
[1:16:14] <rudiciuscaesar> Genesis is bullshit, GACKT as a musician is super cool.
[1:16:17] <suitangi021> He's better than gackt loveless and dumb apples
[1:16:18] <BillieNoMates> indoctrination
[1:16:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> Hojo's plan to RE-segregate baseball
[1:16:25] <%Samex_Comex> More like Shit ra
[1:16:29] <+Neoripo> Welcome to the brainwashing tour
[1:16:30] <arkv01> scarlet is mommy
[1:16:31] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes no Eli - she is EVIL SEXY BOOBS
[1:16:32] <BillieNoMates> Nah. She's mommy bewbs
[1:16:36] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, does Scarlet have materia between her tits!?
[1:16:40] <BurdRightsActivist> BOOBS v BOOBS: Dawn of Justice
[1:16:45] <examplez0> Advent Children literally ruins the legacy of the original FF7 in addition to being poorly directed and poorly written
[1:16:45] <+claudesavegely> and then there's Palmer
[1:16:46] <jiin6> Tit materia
[1:16:48] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Heidegger has EIGHT BELTS.
[1:16:49] <+HawkGoggles2> He's so round.
[1:16:52] <BillieNoMates> Palmer is just Pat
[1:16:54] <mrgaster8> info dump
[1:16:54] <OToole42> "I wish I was in my robot cat right now......."
[1:16:56] <arkv01> THEY EACH HAVE GYM BADGES
[1:17:03] <BurdRightsActivist> You mean "Hoyo" ?
[1:17:03] <rudiciuscaesar> LMAO GYM BADGES!!
[1:17:04] <IntrepidEye> Did Palmer ever do anything?
[1:17:04] <ZE_Count> he a big ol creepo that hojo
[1:17:05] <Lobster_Lord> Cant wait for the mud wrestling scene with Tifa and Scarlett
[1:17:05] <BillieNoMates> President Chad
[1:17:08] <kingra> Hojo should be weird looking
[1:17:10] <+CrimsonDio11> I feel like they made hojo look like shit on purpose man
[1:17:18] <+eanscrale> Hojo looked like a normal grump before, but now he looks like he hasn't bathed in ten years
[1:17:21] <BillieNoMates> I think thats the point
[1:17:22] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah
[1:17:26] <Gairhard> ??
[1:17:26] <ZE_Count> yeah
[1:17:26] <arkv01> it's intended yeah
[1:17:31] <+Neoripo> It's on purpose
[1:17:33] <IntrepidEye> Hojo looks like a fucking thin man. Its creepy
[1:17:36] <GiygasDrillBreak> these came from Crisis Core
[1:17:36] <turbofolk> "exciting adventures!"Like planning the genocide on our people to justify war!
[1:17:41] <BillieNoMates> mommy tits
[1:17:46] <rudiciuscaesar> Scarlet's Materia boobs
[1:17:48] <examplez0> They're fake as fuck
[1:17:49] <ckkc1> haha broobies
[1:17:49] <oshkeet41> Hojo's always had that weird look of Japanese-goblin / american carictature of some ww2 propoganda
[1:17:51] <rudiciuscaesar> wait
[1:17:55] <rudiciuscaesar> is that ED209!?
[1:18:03] <+Neoripo> Check Hojo's
[1:18:03] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao it's Pat.
[1:18:03] <arkv01> it's just pat
[1:18:05] <BurdRightsActivist> It's Pat
[1:18:06] <ZE_Count> Palmer got that Pat bod
[1:18:08] <BillieNoMates> Goddamn it Pat
[1:18:14] <arkv01> this is pats future
[1:18:21] <BillieNoMates> This is Pat's present
[1:18:23] <examplez0> This is Pat 30 years from now
[1:18:23] <+HawkGoggles2> What shitty microphone recorded this?
[1:18:27] <Void_The_Dark> Just like Seath, ain't got no legs
[1:18:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> Sweepers are cool because they are Marauder 3R
[1:18:32] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> palmer look like he about to tell you he killed fiddy men
[1:18:36] <rudiciuscaesar> Paige is gonna swoon at this scene lmao jk.
[1:18:36] <mrgaster8> it pat
[1:18:51] <BillieNoMates> Shouldn't you invest in expansion of capability when you have EXCESS resources?
[1:18:59] <Owkono> that was the best take
[1:19:01] <examplez0> It's a mannequin
[1:19:03] <BillieNoMates> it's just a Soldier 3
[1:19:05] <ckkc1> what chapter is this
[1:19:05] <oshkeet41> bold of you to imply they wouldnt just taxidermy a dead solider
[1:19:06] <arkv01> it just a mummified 3C ScaredyCat
[1:19:06] <examplez0> I think
[1:19:06] <+some_brave_apollo> its a dummy, you dfummy
[1:19:07] <turbofolk> A frozen NPC
[1:19:10] <Sokumotanaka> HELP HIM
[1:19:11] <ZE_Count> Hojo just killed a guy for that
[1:19:12] <kingra> FREE HIM BibleThump
[1:19:15] <ThatGuyThere03> Soldier 2nd class iirc
[1:19:17] <GiygasDrillBreak> well it's a very cheap way to put a mannequin
[1:19:17] <rudiciuscaesar> Taxidermy
[1:19:17] <$jamarartdoodles> lol
[1:19:18] <%caramello_man> "now stand REAL still Billy"
[1:19:23] <+Neoripo> Knowing Hojo, it probably is
[1:19:28] <+eanscrale> they have shifts I imagine
[1:19:38] <Sokumotanaka> THAT'S KUNSEL!!
[1:19:39] <+claudesavegely> and there's this asshole
[1:19:40] <BillieNoMates> It's like those guards at Buckingham Palace
[1:19:44] <rudiciuscaesar> comically evil
[1:19:48] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Thanks Hojo.
[1:19:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> Kunsel looks like every other 3rd Class
[1:19:49] <BillieNoMates> Except its in Shinra HQ and they wear less retarded hats
[1:19:50] <turbofolk> I love bestiality- hojo 2020
[1:19:53] <+some_brave_apollo> Hojo's voice doesn't sound old enough to me
[1:20:03] <Void_The_Dark> Why would they put this out here
[1:20:04] <IntrepidEye> is that any worse than the guy who has to be Scarlets dog and footrest
[1:20:04] <oshkeet41> This is the sort of dude who'd claim to be sapiosexual
[1:20:05] <BillieNoMates> "I have fetuses to inject"
[1:20:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> No HR department would let that through
[1:20:07] <Lobster_Lord> Daddy Hojo Kreygasm
[1:20:16] <samuelfisk> I love that all the Shinra elite are super uncomfortable to be talking to people outside their comfort zones.
[1:20:23] <+HawkGoggles2> "You stupid motherfucker, go home."
[1:20:25] <sporeian94> its under construction
[1:20:28] <rudiciuscaesar> I always thought Hojo had way more power than his position would allow him. Like, he had shadow power, like, behind the scenes but obviously known, and that's why Scarlet and Heidegger had to accept him.
[1:20:29] <arkv01> mommy scarlet soon Kreygasm
[1:20:39] <BillieNoMates> the bike
[1:20:39] <Void_The_Dark> He did even less
[1:20:41] <oshkeet41> this is a weird infodump sequence when you could just use some NPCs gossip-shittalking in the background
[1:20:44] <GiygasDrillBreak> the museum is for visitors for business, it's an intimidation technique before a negotiation
[1:20:45] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> no hr department would let shinra exist. it seems like the only way you get hired is I REALLY LIKE TORTURE THOUGH
[1:20:50] <Shwepie> They have a PR department, but the PR department doesn't have the balls to stand up to the people in charge and reign them in.
[1:20:51] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, that a Predator?
[1:20:57] <+Neoripo> Look, a GARDEN!
[1:21:01] <turbofolk> Look at all those frozen NPC on their defaults poses
[1:21:05] <arkv01> dat some neo midgar?
[1:21:05] <BillieNoMates> That'd be interesting to see as the Neo Midgar
[1:21:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> NEO MIDGAR
[1:21:07] <+claudesavegely> Neo Midgard
[1:21:11] <Lobster_Lord> Chad Hojo cucked virgin Edward Cullen
[1:21:12] <rudiciuscaesar> OH MY GOD Balamb Garden
[1:21:16] <arkv01> neo midgar is just esthar
[1:21:18] <jggoryl> it'll be balamb garden
[1:21:18] <TheWe4pon> is that a garden?
[1:21:23] <BurdRightsActivist> This is that one shitty meme image people use of "THIS IS HOW OUR FUTURE WOLD LOOK LIKE"
[1:21:25] <examplez0> Looks like Numara from Lost Odyssey
[1:21:25] <+Pyroclase> Neo Midgar is so omptimistic
[1:21:29] <+eanscrale> It looks sooooo impractical
[1:21:29] <+Neoripo> yep, a garden
[1:21:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> of course Midgar looks like garbage, it was built in the 1970s
[1:21:34] <BillieNoMates> FF7 and FF8 are intertwined anyway Kappa
[1:21:38] <Fredcome2bed> venus project LUL
[1:22:05] <Huntercd> That is a damn lie
[1:22:11] <rudiciuscaesar> Reeve always pissed me off. How did he get that far on the ladder? He was clearly evil enough to get up that far, something isn't right.
[1:22:21] <Huntercd> The Infrastructure is falling apart
[1:22:38] <jumbomanlive> Reeve got his position because he was that good
[1:22:40] <oniwahoo> Look, Shinra's got their plate full >.>
[1:22:41] <arkv01> but why is the ARM
[1:22:44] <jumbomanlive> so that shinra could yuse him
[1:22:48] <ZE_Count> look at this cool arm!
[1:22:49] <BillieNoMates> BIG O. It's SHOW TIME
[1:22:54] <+Neoripo> Construction robot?
[1:22:54] <BurdRightsActivist> A R M S
[1:22:56] <Huntercd> Not to mention horrible bug creatures
[1:22:56] <GoopyEuclid> It feels like the arm is a boss or something
[1:22:59] <kingra> The arm is for fisting the Weapons
[1:23:01] <rudiciuscaesar> you think so about Reeve? That his merit alone? Idk, Shinra doesn't seem to value merit.
[1:23:02] <+NormenKD> First of it's kind! Behold!
[1:23:09] <GiygasDrillBreak> here's a protip: midgar pizza is really an oil rig purpose
[1:23:13] <turbofolk> no
[1:23:15] <rudiciuscaesar> well, idk. Sephiroth got what he did by merit, I guess.
[1:23:23] <Lobster_Lord> Not all corp execs are evil i guess
[1:23:28] <BurdRightsActivist> Holy shit this padding is ATTROCIOUS
[1:23:40] <+Neoripo> Brainwashing ad
[1:23:50] <jggoryl> no progress until you watch our propaganda
[1:23:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> fun fact: midgar's diameter is the length of 2 supercarriers bow to stern
[1:23:57] <turbofolk> OH MY GOD LOOK AT THOSE BETA MAPS
[1:24:02] <rudiciuscaesar> having met my old CEO after he got 55,150,00 in severance and I, a manager, got less than 1,000, I am unsure if they're good people at the top of ANY company.
[1:24:04] <+Solid_Stro> WATCH o__O
[1:24:10] <rudiciuscaesar> RIP TRU.
[1:24:12] <jumbomanlive> i really like this part to be honest
[1:24:40] <rudiciuscaesar> @jumbomanlive me too. I love model trains and this type of stuff, this installation art.
[1:24:40] <+Neoripo> Limitless
[1:24:46] <+Pyroclase> How inefficient are mako reactors, that you need eight of them just to power one city?
[1:24:48] <arkv01> its the theme
[1:24:50] <oniwahoo> Physics don't exist here
[1:24:53] <Shwepie> And over here we are torturing the souls of the dead to make a neat virtual image of our city!
[1:24:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> they ACTUALLY built a 1/10000 scale model of Midgar
[1:24:57] <Fredcome2bed> There is this famous japaneese inventor, who makes every visitor watch a 30min film about his achievments before meeting him
[1:25:03] <ZE_Count> Use the afterlife as fuel for your car!
[1:25:11] <rudiciuscaesar> is that Sephiroth's theme?
[1:25:11] <jumbomanlive> i love how stark of a contrast this place is compared to the underplate of Midgar
[1:25:16] <arkv01> oh shit, we doing fossil fuel commentary
[1:25:18] <$jamarartdoodles> Limitless I don't think so. Just like Oil
[1:25:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> very efficient actually, they STORE the mako
[1:25:26] <Sokumotanaka> Wait wait wait if they had this level of technology like holograms and shit, why didn't reeve make a more useful robot to tag along with cloud's gang!?
[1:25:30] <bloodybacon> Oooh, helloooo
[1:25:34] <oniwahoo> @pyroclase I mean look at how much is just shooting out of the top, Shinra is incredibly wasteful
[1:25:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> mako has a higher energy density than petroleum
[1:25:41] <+claudesavegely> I just did that stupid puzzle like 2 hours ago
[1:25:51] <rudiciuscaesar> SHINRA SCHOLAR
[1:25:53] <Lobster_Lord> Cloud is a climate change denier
[1:25:57] <jggoryl> 2 hour degree baby
[1:26:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> 9 mako reactors = Shinra has monopoly on portable energy
[1:26:00] <sporeian94> THIS IS THE COOLEST CUTSCENE IN THE GAME
[1:26:00] <oshkeet41> 'thats where we keep the animes'
[1:26:01] <+Neoripo> Brainwashing continues
[1:26:01] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao @Lobster_Lord
[1:26:05] <rudiciuscaesar> that's the best
[1:26:05] <BurdRightsActivist> The fucking padding ResidentSleeper
[1:26:12] <%Samex_Comex> When do we get to the gift shop
[1:26:13] <+some_brave_apollo> why is this part of the main quest
[1:26:19] <+whiskey_wolfe_> What is it with Japan and idealizing childlike voices for things like robots and holograms?
[1:26:25] <$Rivalshotzgp> If drugs that made people happy but infertile, would cloud support them
[1:26:26] <+XxBTExX> Cutscenes Done Slow
[1:26:30] <arkv01> yeah I am going to love speedruns of this
[1:26:35] <Owkono> just mashing forward in frustration
[1:26:36] <kingra> That sounds hillarious
[1:26:36] <arkv01> break this game
[1:26:40] <examplez0> This would be the point where they give up
[1:26:40] <BurdRightsActivist> FINAL HALLWAY 7: RE:MAKE
[1:26:40] <rudiciuscaesar> Cosmos Theatre better be an adult theatre
[1:26:41] <OToole42> there will for sure be a warp glitch
[1:26:48] <turbofolk> Bring back Shitty games done slow
[1:26:53] <%CyberDingus> stay there bitch
[1:26:56] <+Neoripo> You WILL be brainwashed
[1:26:57] <+HawkGoggles2> Wall collision tech will become so strong. Rubbing their faces on every wall.
[1:27:00] <+XxBTExX> I miss Shitty Games Done SLow
[1:27:02] <kingra> Stop it cunt

[1:27:08] <bloodybacon> @rudiciuscaesar Sexy, sexy planets!
[1:27:10] <examplez0> Oh look the buster sword
[1:27:18] <arkv01> I want cloud to just start kpopping again
[1:27:19] <ZE_Count> LOVE THEM CUTSCENES
[1:27:31] <+claudesavegely> NO
[1:27:34] <Tikigod784> cosmo canyon shit
[1:27:34] <+claudesavegely> GO HARDER
[1:27:41] <rudiciuscaesar> is this where Bugenhagen got this tech?
[1:27:42] <Lobster_Lord> how are they floating?
[1:27:46] <rudiciuscaesar> woah, wait
[1:27:46] <+UnwoundCaesar70> No more is more
[1:27:46] <kingra> BIGGER IS BETTER
[1:27:47] <GiygasDrillBreak> ahahaha it's FF4
[1:27:48] <examplez0> The Avatar sequel is looking great
[1:27:50] <BurdRightsActivist> ROCK MIDGAR LUL
[1:27:51] <+Neoripo> Eorzea
[1:27:52] <+stratibario> then you get to mgs5 which barely had anything
[1:27:53] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, the Cetra!?
[1:27:53] <turbofolk> Ancient Midgar>
[1:27:55] <turbofolk> ?
[1:27:57] <+jiggy_snipe> I swear that was FF9
[1:27:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> literally SNES FF
[1:28:02] <tolloponik> this Civilization Cut scene
[1:28:06] <+Pyroclase> I do love the Shinra revisionist bullshit
[1:28:10] <+HRDSalami654> Nomura restrain himself? What?
[1:28:13] <+XxBTExX> Ancients confirmed for being a bunch of hippies
[1:28:14] <oniwahoo> I didn't understand the instructions: built an entire 1 to 1 scale of Earth for a game that takes place in a 5 block area
[1:28:15] <+Solid_Stro> The ancients were actually black
[1:28:17] <arkv01> no they just airbended it LUL
[1:28:26] <Livelinne> Telling that to Square? bitterShrug
[1:28:27] <+BigCoffee> bullshit PR
[1:28:39] <Lobster_Lord> @Solid_Stro lmao
[1:28:51] <BurdRightsActivist> Wow this makes me want to play FF4. Like a GOOD GAME
[1:28:52] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, Shinra just straight up believes 1 passage from the Cetra bible?
[1:28:54] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Guys I think this game was written by a bunch of dumbos.
[1:29:00] <rudiciuscaesar> oh a meteor....
[1:29:02] <Huntercd> It was a world ending event, there shouldn't be survivors. How is Aeris a descendant? I
[1:29:12] <oshkeet41> dunno about believes. long as it fits into their propoganda its all good
[1:29:14] <rudiciuscaesar> The Calamity that Fall from the Skies. We gonna see it?
[1:29:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> lol Barret loves this
[1:29:27] <+some_brave_apollo> this is a cool visual but idk that it fits in FF7
[1:29:29] <turbofolk> Oh look how they started midgar
[1:29:38] <CursedNobleman> pah, my damn hair trimmer died with 10% of my hair left to cut
[1:29:40] <TonberryLives> The VR tech just seems totally at odds with the industrial steampunk world
[1:29:42] <+XxBTExX> I mean havent some wars begun like that? Like the Crusades n shit?
[1:29:42] <rudiciuscaesar> that looks amazing, those flowers are great.
[1:29:43] <sporeian94> FF7 came out before Halo...
[1:29:50] <rudiciuscaesar> like this is at least visually stunning
[1:29:54] <IntrepidEye> Not really how things went down in Halo.
[1:29:56] <+jiggy_snipe> Shinra is so dumb
[1:29:57] <bloodybacon> The Promised Land is being one with Mako. Wowee.
[1:29:57] <oniwahoo> Was that Balamb Garden?!
[1:30:05] <Lobster_Lord> ff8 world
[1:30:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> plague... they cant fly into space
[1:30:07] <turbofolk> FF7 beat halo by like 4 years
[1:30:09] <+Nicos143> Was that actually how the war in halo started?
[1:30:12] <BurdRightsActivist> WHO THE FUCK
[1:30:13] <rudiciuscaesar> wait
[1:30:14] <+RaveBV> here comes the bullshit
[1:30:14] <+Neoripo> It's propaganda
[1:30:17] <turbofolk> WAIT WHAT
[1:30:17] <rudiciuscaesar> are they ALL SEEING THIS!?
[1:30:20] <samuelfisk> I’m not sure they all do. Some still seem like cynical bastards.
[1:30:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> they almost went to space and failed
[1:30:21] <+RaveBV> organization 13
[1:30:23] <Sokumotanaka> are they hobos if they lived in houses?
[1:30:24] <oshkeet41> Might be an allusion to all the bizzare mysticism nazi/ww2 era folks were into
[1:30:25] <BillieNoMates> Just cast reflect
[1:30:26] <jggoryl> aw nuts
[1:30:26] <Futurecity10> So what I gleamed from that plague is that you know nothing about halo
[1:30:27] <+XxBTExX> Destruction porn
[1:30:30] <kingra> KINGDOM HEARTS
[1:30:35] <BurdRightsActivist> A flashforward of a GOOD GAME PogChamp
[1:30:38] <turbofolk> OH NO
[1:30:39] <IntrepidEye> The war in Halo started because the Prophets were assholes
[1:30:40] <arkv01> man this give up machine is not doing my boner any favors
[1:30:42] <GeltonZ> Shinra! WHY WOULD YOU RENDER THIS!
[1:30:45] <rudiciuscaesar> oh wait, this is just what Cloud is seeing
[1:30:46] <suitangi021> great timeline ghost interference
[1:30:46] <kingra> WHO?????
[1:30:50] <kiwicoffin> He's too anime to be stopped
[1:30:53] <tolloponik> wait is barret and tifa seeing what cloud is seeing now?
[1:30:55] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Look at this excellent storytelling for plot beats that won't exist until 3 games from now.
[1:30:55] <SilverRoddo> It’s secret land, hidden in between, reality, or something.
[1:30:55] <+some_brave_apollo> Everyone knows who Sephiroth is, duh
[1:30:56] <Shwepie> Ancients confirmed for hollow earthers.
[1:30:57] <turbofolk> OH MY GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!
[1:30:58] <%Samex_Comex> Christopher Lambert!?
[1:31:00] <BillieNoMates> Pats back
[1:31:01] <+RaveBV> Plague is right though. The aliens in halo misinterpreted what the halo rings were used for.
[1:31:02] <+some_brave_apollo> he's like Batman
[1:31:03] <BurdRightsActivist> Sephiroth is just a fucking crazy person LUL
[1:31:03] <+claudesavegely> Cloud doesn't explain who sephiroth is until you LEAVE midgar
[1:31:05] <FinchBot> i sure as hell dont
[1:31:06] <CursedNobleman> mmn, lard tea LUL
[1:31:08] <+XxBTExX> I have no idea whats going on and I played the original
[1:31:09] <arkv01> an entire generation only knows sephiroth from Kingdom Hearts
[1:31:13] <+Pyroclase> There's a new interview where the writers explain how they didn't explain him because "everyone knows who Sephiroth is!"
[1:31:14] <BillieNoMates> NO
[1:31:16] <rudiciuscaesar> he looks like a fat Jack Nicholson Joker.
[1:31:17] <BillieNoMates> HES SO TALL!
[1:31:18] <examplez0> And to think Square Enix were advertising this as a good jumping on point for newbies
[1:31:19] <turbofolk> OH FUCK OFF
[1:31:20] <BillieNoMates> and has long hair!
[1:31:22] <Huntercd> This fat fuck
[1:31:23] <Lobster_Lord> Palmer did nothing wrong,protect him
[1:31:27] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Yeah I feel like this game is not made for new people
[1:31:27] <+BigCoffee> @PlagueOfGripes They recently did an interview with the devs post release. You will shit yourself. They assume literally everyone knows who sephiroth is and made the game according to that knowledge.
[1:31:27] <rudiciuscaesar> that's the REAL one!?
[1:31:31] <rudiciuscaesar> well, "real" one?
[1:31:31] <arkv01> palmer wasn't even worth cutting down
[1:31:33] <ThatGuyThere03> WAIT WHAT
[1:31:36] <examplez0> Same energy
[1:31:36] <rudiciuscaesar> was that mama?
[1:31:39] <+MrPervSan> Palmer is a shape, not a person.
[1:31:40] <+jiggy_snipe> wait was Seph just walking around?
[1:31:49] <rudiciuscaesar> "As long as I've got my mama!"
[1:31:50] <+Kyros_v76> So the Violater got a cushy desk job after his time in Hell
[1:31:50] <GiygasDrillBreak> palmer is literally least evil exec #2
[1:31:51] <heroicspiritavenger> Part of the problem @PlagueOfGripes is this is clearly not made to be accessible to someone dipping their toe into the franchise for the first time
[1:32:09] <+BigCoffee> Ok but to be fair, they only care about Japan
[1:32:15] <rudiciuscaesar> Japan is culturally tone deaf to anything that isn't Japan.
[1:32:17] <+BigCoffee> everyone else is second fiddle
[1:32:18] <BillieNoMates> Because its almost all mountains
[1:32:19] <+some_brave_apollo> they don't give a shit about non-Japanese people
[1:32:22] <+some_brave_apollo> except Capcom
[1:32:23] <+UnwoundCaesar70> If we didn't make it we won't use it
[1:32:26] <+XxBTExX> There is beer up north
[1:32:28] <examplez0> And the Okinawan islands
[1:32:29] <rudiciuscaesar> the Ainu
[1:32:38] <CursedNobleman> HOKKAIDO DA
[1:32:38] <rudiciuscaesar> oh yeah, the Ryukyu/Liuqiu Islands.
[1:32:40] <TonberryLives> It's a highly conservative and isolationist viewpoint
[1:32:43] <Tikigod784> Ainu got cucked
[1:32:46] <turbofolk> Hey we can thank mac arthur for keeping that part of japanese culture intact
[1:32:47] <Sokumotanaka> Sounds like america
[1:32:57] <+HawkGoggles2> An island nation.
[1:32:57] <tolloponik> their slowly learning
[1:33:02] <rudiciuscaesar> does kinda sound like America now...
[1:33:02] <+jiggy_snipe> very set in their ways
[1:33:02] <Livelinne> They’re living in a island!!
[1:33:04] <+HRDSalami654> Kind of like Native Americans.
[1:33:06] <+some_brave_apollo> Businesses are all owned by old men
[1:33:07] <+whiskey_wolfe_> No, it doesn't sound like America, and I say that as a non-American. That's a lazy-ass analogy.
[1:33:07] <+XxBTExX> @Sokumotanaka true. the coasts full of people and everyone in the middle is whatever
[1:33:12] <arkv01> I mean it's fair, they forcus on the domestic market first because it's big enough
[1:33:15] <BurdRightsActivist> Even japan doesn't know who Sepphy is, Sephiroth is just a crazy person, that's all he is. 4Head
[1:33:18] <Livelinne> A cultural Galapagos
[1:33:19] <IntrepidEye> Pat talked about this earlier. He tried talking to some people what they thought about the changes but they never played the original because they are only 20
[1:33:20] <examplez0> That's a problem with the entire compilation
[1:33:25] <examplez0> Especially Advent Children
[1:33:27] <Lobster_Lord> Well Japan was an evil empire less than 100 years ago so...
[1:33:28] <Tikigod784> there's a method to their madness, but it's still stupid
[1:33:34] <Huntercd> That is bad writing
[1:33:36] <rudiciuscaesar> I like that they haven't explained shit about him.
[1:33:38] <examplez0> Tune in to episode 2 to find out
[1:33:40] <jumbomanlive> dont they explain sephiroth after midgar?
[1:33:44] <+BigCoffee> You know? I wish I could tlak japanese, just to see the 2chan boards and see japan's reaction to the game.
[1:33:47] <jumbomanlive> like
[1:33:48] <arkv01> sephiroth is here for mans booty
[1:33:48] <+XxBTExX> @whiskey_wolfe_ self centered assholes that live in their own little bubble and care little for everyone else? Doesnt that sound like people from California or NY?
[1:33:49] <rudiciuscaesar> he just gets thrown in as surprise
[1:33:50] <kingra> When Sephiroth is not on screen people should be asking "Where's Sephiroth?"
[1:33:53] <suitangi021> Cultural and circumstantial assunptions make for great writing
[1:33:53] <rudiciuscaesar> I mean, in this scene.
[1:33:57] <nubnova> isnt that fine? less is more.
[1:33:58] <BurdRightsActivist> NO IT'S A GOOD GAME MAX SAID SO ITS PERFECT
[1:33:59] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes GaijinGoombah fucking hates it LUL
[1:34:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> city dwellers ARE self-centered, yes
[1:34:03] <TonberryLives> OH BOY
[1:34:04] <FullmetalGeist> How's Sephiroth?
[1:34:04] <+BigCoffee> @kingra HAH
[1:34:05] <+Pyroclase> They grasped a lot of what made the characters great, but struggled with the actual plot
[1:34:08] <examplez0> Yeah I mean it still seems like a masterpiece compared to the rest of the compilation but it's still a hot mess
[1:34:09] <oshkeet41> The other problem is people assume everyon is gonna consume all the side content too, since they expect that of their audience too
[1:34:09] <ZE_Count> Yeah the last hour is a bit crazy.
[1:34:11] <+jiggy_snipe> yes
[1:34:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> @XxBTExX America is at the very least a nation of immigrants, not a xenophobic island-state.
[1:34:25] <turbofolk> We know the sequels to FF7R wont be FF7 their are gonna be something else
[1:34:25] <rudiciuscaesar> and then use Sepiroth as a stinger, seeing Shinra dead
[1:34:28] <arkv01> time ghosts REALLY should not have been in the first episode
[1:34:29] <+jiggy_snipe> like the original?
[1:34:34] <Lobster_Lord> Ya but they need Sephi for the marketing. Gotta hype up the fujoshis
[1:34:35] <+BigCoffee> Last boss could be Jenova
[1:34:36] <+some_brave_apollo> But they can't make FF& without the universally famous Sephiroth
[1:34:37] <arkv01> I could tolerate it for episode 2
[1:34:38] <examplez0> And have Sephiroth mentioned and appear in flashbacks
[1:34:40] <+BigCoffee> in ff7r1
[1:34:52] <+HawkGoggles2> Escape?
[1:35:00] <rudiciuscaesar> Shina's death, the major spoiler death, and then part 3, final boss, Sephiroth's defeat?
[1:35:04] <BurdRightsActivist> @rudiciuscaesar Sephiroth stingers President Shinra and does a SSS combo on him
[1:35:10] <+RaveBV> The hydra?
[1:35:12] <suitangi021> @PlagueOfGripes So you mean the pacing of the original games first arc
[1:35:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes, they put Sephiroth in remake JUST FOR japanese fans of Sephiroth, because "everyone is a fan of Sephiroth" said japanese people
[1:35:25] <IntrepidEye> The time ghosts aren't a bad concept but they should have been used very sparingly and kept mysterious until the next game
[1:35:34] <TonberryLives> I'm calling it now Eli; you are not going to like the ending lolol
[1:35:35] <heroicspiritavenger> The first part of the game, should plot wise revolve heavily around Mortality and how mankind use technology to push against Natural Order including Death; but you can't avoid absolutes.
[1:35:36] <rudiciuscaesar> OH THAT'S GOOD, and Sephiroth killing the Midgar Zolom later, that's symbolic
[1:35:39] <BurdRightsActivist> "major spoiler death" bruh they're showing flash forwards to her death IN THIS GAME 4Head
[1:35:39] <TheWe4pon> not pulling up the roots ofa weed ?
[1:35:44] <Lobster_Lord> Plague is thinking too hard about this.They just want to make cool anime flippy dippy shit like advent children
[1:35:44] <suitangi021> Japanese games don't want to look at systemic problems just blame individuals
[1:35:49] <arkv01> spread that propaganda!
[1:35:51] <turbofolk> But its not sephiroth tho THIS IS KH SEPHIROTH
[1:35:51] <Jigokuro> Bic loved the ending but I bet you won't bitterLOL
[1:36:00] <+XxBTExX> @GiygasDrillBreak they know that Sephiroth is basically the most known FF character
[1:36:09] <rudiciuscaesar> Deputy Mayor?
[1:36:15] <Melchior_the_Wise> Is this the guy from the Matrix?
[1:36:16] <oniwahoo> Literally telling people to go out and spread the good word about Shinra lol
[1:36:18] <Owkono> colonel sanders?
[1:36:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's the assumption Eli is talking about, that only Sephiroth is the most important character
[1:36:29] <fluffy_sauce> lol
[1:36:30] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes hope you have 10k gil for a weapon
[1:36:31] <examplez0> I agree
[1:36:32] <+claudesavegely> wonder if the mayor gives you an elemental materia
[1:36:32] <rudiciuscaesar> oh shit that beard is great
[1:36:37] <kiwicoffin> I've only heard confusion
[1:36:41] <+Pyroclase> Nothing wrong with having low standards for JRPGs.
[1:36:41] <BurdRightsActivist> Max is going to like it
[1:36:42] <examplez0> People that like the ending are stupid
[1:36:42] <oniwahoo> If the ending is great for idiots, I'll probably like it
[1:36:44] <Dez_Rambler> why is he dressed as a leprechaun?
[1:36:47] <+jiggy_snipe> there is a decent amount of people who enjoy it
[1:36:50] <Tikigod784> give him gil lol
[1:36:51] <sporeian94> I thought the music was good in the ending
[1:36:53] <CursedNobleman> whats the matter Colonel Sanders? Chicken? LUL
[1:36:58] <+claudesavegely> I liked the ending, which apparently makes me a nomura cuck
[1:37:10] <+XxBTExX> Its a goddamn miracle they didnt include Lightning in this given how hard they pushed FF13
[1:37:10] <examplez0> He looks like the King on the playing cards
[1:37:11] <BurdRightsActivist> @claudesavegely Nonumbo cuck
[1:37:11] <+RaveBV> That fucker looks like he wants to sell me some chicken.
[1:37:12] <+ChaosEmralds> I liked it too
[1:37:13] <+BigCoffee> It's dead to me
[1:37:15] <Lobster_Lord> They will for sure
[1:37:16] <rudiciuscaesar> I love how we can just use Nomura as an adjective.
[1:37:20] <CursedNobleman> @claudesavegely CUCK CUCK! LUL
[1:37:22] <suitangi021> It'll make money so it'll happen
[1:37:23] <+some_brave_apollo> I would LOVE if this never got any sequels
[1:37:27] <+eanscrale> Well I've got some bad news then...
[1:37:30] <ScreamLord> To bad
[1:37:32] <arkv01> these robots look really sad :(
[1:37:33] <+RaveBV> I love how we can tell which things were Nomura tropes.
[1:37:34] <examplez0> It will be it's own thing from the next episode onwards
[1:37:39] <examplez0> That's what the ending implied
[1:37:40] <+HRDSalami654> You're going to get more of it though.
[1:37:42] <turbofolk> Too bad plague you are going to get FF7R 2.22!
[1:37:45] <+HRDSalami654> In about 20 years.
[1:37:47] <Tikigod784> @PlagueOfGripes you gonna do a gripe rant thing after you beat this?
[1:37:47] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, Nomura needs to be pulled back a bit
[1:37:49] <+Pyroclase> this is a really pretty library
[1:37:49] <Lobster_Lord> Sad robots? Nier Automata?
[1:37:49] <IntrepidEye> Part 2 will hopefully be better since its a lot more open
[1:37:50] <+BigCoffee> as a librarian this is cool
[1:37:50] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I liked the ending, but it made me very scared. I am not worry with the characters being butchered, but with Nomura Noraing it up from now
[1:37:50] <$Rivalshotzgp> Just make ff16 in a similar setting
[1:37:53] <Sokumotanaka> Well if that did happen which it wont I'd like ff16!
[1:37:59] <%JailShmixRemix> Can't wait till FF8 REMAKE
[1:38:01] <rudiciuscaesar> I think since his sexual climax of FF10, he's been too spent.
[1:38:05] <theloganbrand> This game already has so much compilation stuff in it
[1:38:05] <FinchBot> ff7r 3 will be kh4
[1:38:07] <rudiciuscaesar> FF8 Remake will be amazing
[1:38:08] <+Pyroclase> Dirge of Cerberus remake when
[1:38:08] <Huntercd> Why is it hidden?
[1:38:09] <oniwahoo> FF7R Final Mix
[1:38:10] <+eanscrale> Everyone ready for Gackt to come back???
[1:38:11] <+ChaosEmralds> ff6 remake
[1:38:12] <ThatGuyThere03> why though?
[1:38:16] <rudiciuscaesar> OH GOD, wait, wait wait, it's gonna be like Star Wars
[1:38:19] <ToeBeanHeaven> Strap in, Plague. We've got FF7R ReMember 2..14159265359 Final Mix
[1:38:20] <BurdRightsActivist> ZOOMERS ResidentSleeper
[1:38:21] <ScreamLord> I actually wouldn't mind a rehash of Dirge
[1:38:21] <TonberryLives> Ehhhhhh I'd actually be surprised if they touched the Compliation again
[1:38:23] <ThatGuyThere03> Everybody agrees the compilation shit is terrible
[1:38:26] <examplez0> I just watched that scene in Crisis Core where a Genesis troop eats Zack's hair and almost cringed themselves to death
[1:38:27] <sporeian94> Remake FF9!
[1:38:29] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:38:30] <+XxBTExX> Im ok with a FF6 or a FFT remake of sorts
[1:38:30] <+Pyroclase> What if they remade 6?
[1:38:32] <%JailShmixRemix> FF8 is ok.... :(
[1:38:33] <examplez0> And yes that actually does happen
[1:38:34] <GiygasDrillBreak> I like FF8 and i know it's garbage
[1:38:35] <Tikigod784> Disney now owns FF7 BibleThump
[1:38:35] <OToole42> 8 hurts my soul
[1:38:36] <tolloponik> so what fallout fans are dealing with now
[1:38:36] <Livelinne> I as a Japanese, I think it’s more like Nomura thing...
[1:38:37] <Owkono> don't worry they are too busy playing fortnite
[1:38:37] <mrgaster8> this is literally me im 20 so i had always heard ff7 was a great game so when i heard their remaking this game i was happy to play ff7 but after i finished this game i had to watch a video to get more context to make sens
[1:38:42] <arkv01> yeah 8's got issues and I still love it :D
[1:38:43] <BurdRightsActivist> I just want to see a decent port of FF6, that's ALL I WANT
[1:38:44] <MrHappyFunshine> Time ghosts would actually make sense in 8
[1:38:44] <Sokumotanaka> I'M tired of people talking about the orignal!
[1:38:46] <Kraidn> Why didn't you like FF8?
[1:38:47] <$Rivalshotzgp> FFX and X2 remakes, the 4 parter
[1:38:47] <suitangi021> Barret is great
[1:38:53] <bloodybacon> REALLY?
[1:38:57] <arkv01> forced camera focus bullshit again
[1:38:57] <ScreamLord> Barret is the best character
[1:39:00] <bloodybacon> Jesus christ
[1:39:01] <BurdRightsActivist> FINAL HALLWAY 7 RE:MAKE ELECTRIC NONUMBO
[1:39:01] <kiwicoffin> I wouldn't mind an 8 remake since it was a strange time travel cluster anyways
[1:39:02] <kingra> TIME GHOSTS SAYS NO
[1:39:04] <CursedNobleman> Final Fantasy Tactics with TIME GHOSTS LUL
[1:39:05] <Lobster_Lord> im already seeing pushback against this game
[1:39:15] <examplez0> I think a FF8 would actually improve on the original since it already had time travel
[1:39:22] <examplez0> *FF8 remake
[1:39:23] <tukds> absolutely seething
[1:39:25] <GiygasDrillBreak> Time Ghosts are smalltime, the white Stop Sign is the real enemy
[1:39:26] <Tikigod784> FF9 remake will hurt
[1:39:27] <Livelinne> LUL
[1:39:27] <+XxBTExX> @CursedNobleman I'd take it. I jsut want that delicious battle system
[1:39:29] <+RaveBV> Remember when people complained about FF13's railroad to the end? I wonder how biased towards this people will be.
[1:39:34] <Tikigod784> FFX-2 plays great
[1:39:38] <examplez0> They should make a game out of X-2.5
[1:39:38] <Kraidn> It's crap like this where you feel like you get some freedom of movement, and it just takes you RIGHT the fuck outta control FailFish
[1:39:39] <turbofolk> Hell im sure after this game toriyama will also want to remake FFXIII
[1:39:39] <%Samex_Comex> The intro was cool
[1:39:40] <Tikigod784> that's about it
[1:39:40] <GiygasDrillBreak> DOMINO'S PIZZA
[1:39:41] <arkv01> no shuddup X-2 is great :D
[1:39:42] <rudiciuscaesar> I actually LOVE FF8 and you're right. It has some major problems, mainly the battles are boring as piss. I have more enjoyment watching others LP it, than me playing it. Though I was just in high school when it came out, so the school atmosphere really captivated me.
[1:39:42] <GeltonZ> YEAH! I want an X-2 remake!
[1:39:42] <Lobster_Lord> They are making X-3 tho
[1:39:44] <+SunnyRmuffins> is that even posable ?
[1:39:45] <bloodybacon> @PlagueOfGripes "The Script says: NO."
[1:39:48] <Sokumotanaka> They should remake ff 13
[1:39:49] <sporeian94> make FFX-2.5 a gane!
[1:39:52] <+HawkGoggles2> He's looks as kooky as I'd expect.
[1:39:53] <ScreamLord> His mustache is awesome
[1:39:54] <Huntercd> Mr. Monopoly here
[1:39:54] <oshkeet41> i think a general 'devs wanting to show off their work' feeling to games over what the players might anna do
[1:39:56] <+Pyroclase> is it me or is his voice mixed too low
[1:39:58] <oniwahoo> Can't make the story of X-2 or it's other works any worse
[1:39:58] <Katorskay> for a second i thought we were talking about megaman, i was about to say x2 was good tho
[1:40:00] <Tommyrats> but they took the stairs!
[1:40:04] <CursedNobleman> @XxBTExX Delita fights fate to keep *spoiler #1 and SUPERSPOILER #2 alive*
[1:40:07] <BurdRightsActivist> Look at all these cutscene screenshots PogChamp
[1:40:12] <IntrepidEye> Just remake XIII-3 while they're at it. Wanna see if its possible to make it worse
[1:40:17] <rudiciuscaesar> what was that phone hand gesture!?
[1:40:17] <+Neoripo> It's funny how plague always trips the "You can't go that way" barrier seconds before that barrier dissapearing
[1:40:24] <arkv01> BIG retcon lol
[1:40:25] <GeltonZ> My big issue was that FFX-2 had some really bad animations. High detail better animated X-2 would be right up my alley.
[1:40:27] <ToeBeanHeaven> Oh god, this is SO AWFUL
[1:40:28] <+some_brave_apollo> that's fucking dumb
[1:40:28] <turbofolk> AWWW YEAH
[1:40:29] <ToeBeanHeaven> MAKE IT STOP
[1:40:36] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It would be nice if we had any agency in any of those decisions.
[1:40:37] <+RaveBV> Oh plague, his position as a mole is going to make less sense.
[1:40:42] <BurdRightsActivist> Max: "Oh shit this is genius woww1!!"
[1:40:43] <Jigokuro> Was he?
[1:40:47] <GiygasDrillBreak> the mayor did all that in the original too, they only added the avalanche part here
[1:40:48] <TheWe4pon> nooo, thats bad
[1:40:48] <Jigokuro> I don't think that is known
[1:40:48] <+Pyroclase> he probably went to Avalance because he hates Shinra, it makes sense
[1:40:56] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, didn't Shinra just build Midgar?
[1:41:01] <+XxBTExX> Dicks were rubbed
[1:41:06] <%JailShmixRemix> Max is max
[1:41:08] <examplez0> Max is too caught up in his love for the original
[1:41:09] <Kraidn> To be honest, I wasn't expecting them to change the story this much
[1:41:10] <+HRDSalami654> Many people are.
[1:41:10] <IntrepidEye> I think he's in denial.
[1:41:10] <Tikigod784> According to Before Crisis, Rufus was the real man on the inside, but I don't know if that's still canon.
[1:41:10] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes SuperButterBuns like it too
[1:41:10] <heroicspiritavenger> Who the fuck gives a shit about that overrated limp dick bitch Max
[1:41:12] <+Pyroclase> I think Midgar is 15 years old at the start of the game
[1:41:14] <kiwicoffin> Max is in love and ready to get his childhood flattened
[1:41:14] <oniwahoo> Wouldn't that give him more reason to help Avalanche? He was the most powerful man around and now he's pretty much nothing
[1:41:18] <GeltonZ> Simmons beat it and it ended with a double facepalm.
[1:41:23] <rudiciuscaesar> I actually like this, the Mayor did really not like being Shinra property
[1:41:29] <%JailShmixRemix> @heroicspiritavenger shutup
[1:41:29] <examplez0> Who is Simmons?
[1:41:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> shinra built reactors for 8 towns, the 8 towns consolidated into midgar, Domino became mayor of the new city
[1:41:33] <+some_brave_apollo> i think a lot of it is post-purchase rationalisation. People were gushing about Outer Worlds for about a month
[1:41:34] <Sokumotanaka> WAIT why isn't reece the man on the inside!?
[1:41:35] <rudiciuscaesar> though Reeve is the inside man, I thought.
[1:41:35] <Katorskay> He's in deep cover, shut up tho
[1:41:37] <turbofolk> I really want max to die on stream by the end of the game
[1:41:39] <Huntercd> The guy only cares because he is salty
[1:41:40] <heroicspiritavenger> @JailShmixRemix No, fuck off
[1:41:41] <Kraidn> Mayer then got on "No that ain't. Get fired" LUL
[1:41:41] <cerazor01> Super Butter Buns hangs out with CLemps
[1:41:42] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeltonZ Show me the double facepalm I want to see it
[1:41:44] <cerazor01> shes annoying
[1:41:44] <+RaveBV> This dweeb is mad that he's the mayor in name only and doesn't have any real status or control over anything, only to now tell us he has enough to keep their presence in the building a secret DESPITE them being caught already
[1:41:46] <+Pyroclase> this does look like a mayor's office yes
[1:41:49] <examplez0> THEY DON'T EVEN INVITE ME TO THEIR BIRTHDAY PARTIES
[1:41:56] <GeltonZ> @examplez0 Max's friend who likes RPGs and plays Dr.Doom.
[1:42:00] <CursedNobleman> i like this douchey old man rant LUL
[1:42:01] <rudiciuscaesar> he was very cartoony in the original
[1:42:08] <examplez0> Oh
[1:42:12] <terminusterminal> If he was a glorified librarian how did he have the authority or power to cover Avalanche's tracks?
[1:42:16] <clouddresshot> :(
[1:42:16] <ToeBeanHeaven> THIS IS ALL SO UNNECESSARY
[1:42:16] <rudiciuscaesar> look how shinny Barret is, that rage sweat.
[1:42:17] <+jiggy_snipe> Im going to treat this as the Mayor recently joined Avalanche cuz he hates Shinra so now he's on the inside
[1:42:18] <+RaveBV> Exactly
[1:42:21] <ToeBeanHeaven> GOD it's infuriating...
[1:42:23] <Explodincatz> its funny hearing barret saying that when hes the one always raging
[1:42:25] <examplez0> He looks like the king on the playing cards
[1:42:26] <+XxBTExX> I played this so long ago I dont even remember him
[1:42:29] <oniwahoo> This version of Barret is amazing
[1:42:31] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Bitterbits (Nic) finished the game yesterday and liked it, but Spy MAY share your sentiment
[1:42:35] <%JailShmixRemix> Alot of people are going to like the remake just because it's FF7
[1:42:36] <+RaveBV> How did he have the power to hush everyone of their presence if he's just the name in title alone.
[1:42:36] <examplez0> Barret is pretty over the top compared to the original too
[1:42:37] <+BigCoffee> Domino is a fun little addition
[1:42:52] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Too be fair, 99% of people that hate Shinra are better people than them by default
[1:42:58] <Lobster_Lord> God Clemps sucks. He just summarizes games in his "reviews"
[1:42:59] <oniwahoo> Fantastic
[1:43:00] <+whiskey_wolfe_> god fuck jesus cunt christ
[1:43:03] <mrgaster8> eheh
[1:43:08] <+RaveBV> Looks like the monopoly guy
[1:43:16] <Jigokuro> Nic has a huge attachment to the original
[1:43:17] <amused_platypus> mayor man is sad cause no power
[1:43:17] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, original Mayor was just a random incompetent dude off the street they gave a job and a suit to
[1:43:24] <rudiciuscaesar> at least how I feel about it.
[1:43:26] <+BigCoffee> Vinny likes it, but is critical to a lot of stuff.
[1:43:38] <Sokumotanaka> Nick landis?
[1:43:42] <TonberryLives> You can still like this for what it is
[1:43:47] <examplez0> Yeah I mean it's pretty tolerable compared to Advent Children, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core aside from the time jannies
[1:43:49] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nobody proofread Nojima's 1000-page script
[1:43:55] <examplez0> Until the final chapter
[1:43:56] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Are you gonna even bother with Part 2
[1:44:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Don't think, don't ask questions, just consume product and then get excited for next products
[1:44:07] <turbofolk> i kinda dislike how max always keeps his chat on sub only mode all the time
[1:44:09] <rudiciuscaesar> this is creating Star Wars Original Trilogy fans vs Prequel Trilogy Fans.
[1:44:16] <+Neoripo> My gripe is, you didn't really need the plotghosts
[1:44:18] <examplez0> It's so they can keep milking it
[1:44:31] <Lobster_Lord> Nojima was always a hack. He tried to connect FFX-2 to FF7 as a joke
[1:44:34] <examplez0> Same reason why Peter Hackson made three movies out of a single book
[1:44:36] <%JailShmixRemix> max has to keep sub only because he'd have too many people chating
[1:44:40] <rudiciuscaesar> the plot ghosts....
[1:44:40] <oshkeet41> Hell, with modern tech you could have lESS padding, with voiceover stuff you can keep walking and exploring while hearing. or bypass entirely.
[1:44:46] <rudiciuscaesar> they better, BETTER say what they are.
[1:44:47] <%JailShmixRemix> If he wants to be able to read chat
[1:44:49] <amused_platypus> plague do you think yuffie will steal all our materia, and thats why we will start with none
[1:44:50] <+RaveBV> It only has padding because part 1 of this multiple part game needs to feel longer and justified as a PART 1.
[1:44:51] <Huntercd> plot ghosts don't add anyingthing
[1:44:52] <rudiciuscaesar> what if they're the spirits of the Cetra?
[1:44:52] <suitangi021> If it were paced like the original without padding this game would be 6 hours top and people would riot
[1:44:56] <+BigCoffee> @Lobster_Lord thats not fair there are a lot of writers, it,s not nomura's fault
[1:45:00] <turbofolk> At least i wouldnt see so many fucking emotes spam all the time
[1:45:04] <mxt8420> whine whine whine
[1:45:05] <examplez0> How the hell does Nojima still have any credibility as a writer after the blitzball bomb?
[1:45:09] <CursedNobleman> but without padding we would need more SICK 3d ASSETS LUL
[1:45:14] <GiygasDrillBreak> japanese writing can never be graded an A
[1:45:18] <Lobster_Lord> @BigCoffee i said nojima
[1:45:20] <rudiciuscaesar> Blllitttzzzballl
[1:45:29] <ToeBeanHeaven> They literally just needed to show the Mayor looking at the monitors, rub his beard like Birkin rubs his chin and then move Avalanche along. Done.
[1:45:32] <rudiciuscaesar> urban planning
[1:45:34] <+Neoripo> MAKO
[1:45:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> guess what MINIGAME is going to happen
[1:46:02] <tukds> what a nerd
[1:46:09] <CursedNobleman> @GiygasDrillBreak TRIPLE TRIAD?! LUL
[1:46:18] <Lobster_Lord> Video games dont have good writing. just read a book gamers
[1:46:19] <+claudesavegely> he gave you the materia if you got it right the first try
[1:46:24] <GiygasDrillBreak> i would shit down my own neck if Part 2 adds a card game
[1:46:27] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:46:27] <examplez0> The King of Harts
[1:46:33] <+Neoripo> Money you say?
[1:46:39] <ThatGuyThere03> Mayor
[1:46:41] <bloodybacon> @PlagueOfGripes Plotghosts, and Plotholes. A lovely combination.
[1:46:45] <TechDragon_Z> He doesn't tell you the password. Just how to do the puzzle. Waste of money, lol
[1:46:53] <+HRDSalami654> What is wrong with his mouth.
[1:46:56] <+HRDSalami654> ?
[1:47:03] <LaMystika> I’ve been lurking, but I think the real reason why they expanded a section of the game that only took about 5 or 6 hours originally is because they can’t stop chasing high end graphics
[1:47:03] <rudiciuscaesar> Mr. SHAKEDOWN
[1:47:05] <GiygasDrillBreak> PIZZA HUT and DOMINO'S PIZZA, get it?
[1:47:06] <Shwepie> Anyone else looking forward to the retelling of Part 1 with Triple Triad for combat coming to the Switch before Part 2 comes out?
[1:47:07] <arkv01> PAY ME
[1:47:14] <amused_platypus> mayor mccheese mod when
[1:47:22] <mrgaster8> @PlagueOfGripes im very curios to see maxs reacting to the end chapters cuz so far hes loving the game
[1:47:41] <+RaveBV> Who do you think would win in a fight? The Mayor or his assistant?
[1:47:43] <GiygasDrillBreak> SE has too many asset creators and not enough software designers
[1:47:45] <examplez0> Has The Completionist finished it yet?
[1:47:46] <kiwicoffin> Unlike the dirty hobos all over Shinra
[1:47:53] <examplez0> I want to know his reaction to the ending as well
[1:47:59] <rudiciuscaesar> EKG CANNON!?! Like the heart procedure!?
[1:48:05] <arkv01> this gun arm socket was made for me
[1:48:11] <rudiciuscaesar> I had one done in February, freaked me out....
[1:48:12] <oniwahoo> You mean to tell me that someone likes to visit the recreational floor to destress.... I am shocked
[1:48:14] <+ButtMcChuggles> Wew I never paid him, i didnt know he gave a weapon
[1:48:14] <CursedNobleman> thats a cool design
[1:48:18] <BillieNoMates> If Tifa complained? "Heres a breast implant"
[1:48:21] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist *checks* Okay not as much of a facepalm as I remember but that ending sure was a thing.
[1:48:23] <turbofolk> @mrgaster8 I really want him to die on the inside but he will probably bit his teeth and be "cautiously optimistic"
[1:48:52] <amused_platypus> the old man was carrying a piece
[1:48:55] <+jiggy_snipe> Max's reaction will be interesting because he doesn't really like the compilation
[1:48:58] <+XxBTExX> Caligula's Bracelet?
[1:49:10] <+forgetme000> they are kinda stingy on the link slots
[1:49:11] <Lobster_Lord> the gameplay works well and the game is pretty.its not like the original had good writing anyways lol
[1:49:17] <LaMystika> though I’m bitter towards this game for a different reason: my PS4 literally died trying to play this game
[1:49:18] <mrgaster8> @turbofolk i dont but who know
[1:49:23] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> but you barely need link materia in this game though
[1:49:25] <+XxBTExX> What do links do again? I forgot
[1:49:25] <+CrimsonDio11> gets new weapon doesnt equip it
[1:49:27] <arkv01> I don't think anyone really likes the compilation at this point, before crisis is cool though
[1:49:32] <GiygasDrillBreak> in OG, you had effectively nothing to work with in terms of gear, in Midgar
[1:49:36] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, @LaMystika
[1:49:39] <+TysonSirius> Hardedge is obnoxiously cool looking
[1:49:42] <rudiciuscaesar> what you mean? Did your PS4 break!?
[1:49:43] <amused_platypus> @LaMystika having played the original i can agree with that
[1:49:45] <Explodincatz> sorry to her that LaM
[1:49:47] <GiygasDrillBreak> so it makes sense all the equipment still sucks
[1:49:53] <turbofolk> @jiggy_snipe he hasn't reacted to the compilation shit on ff7R so he probably doesn't remember well
[1:49:57] <Tommyrats> I thought Barret was avalanche HQ
[1:49:59] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes weapon
[1:50:05] <LaMystika> @jiggy_snipe I’m surprised Max even likes this game at all. I feel like he’s never really played any other RPG in his life
[1:50:05] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes not gonna check out the gun?
[1:50:21] <rudiciuscaesar> @PlagueOfGripes EKG Cannon
[1:50:30] <$jamarartdoodles> You got 1/4 of your money back lol
[1:50:31] <Sokumotanaka> Take one
[1:50:37] <arkv01> cutie robots!
[1:50:39] <%Samex_Comex> Free the robots!
[1:50:43] <Sokumotanaka> Take them with you
[1:50:44] <turbofolk> @LaMystika because he hasn't he a fgc boi just like woolie they dont play a lot of games that aren't FGs
[1:50:49] <samuelfisk> I figured Avalanche HQ was just Barett’s basement or something.
[1:50:51] <+jiggy_snipe> @LaMystika so funny thing, makes actually doesn't really like JRPGs that much. He has played alot on PS1 but before FF7 he thought they were for nerds lol
[1:50:53] <Lobster_Lord> Sad robot game directed by Yoko Taro
[1:50:56] <LaMystika> @rudiciuscaesar yeah, my PS4 honestly doesn’t work anymore. Every game I try to download to it is “corrupted” now :/
[1:50:59] <+jiggy_snipe> Max*
[1:51:05] <+Neoripo> Upgrade it
[1:51:14] <Shwepie> Barret the Paladin
[1:51:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> how about looking at the upgrades for EKG cannon
[1:51:16] <kiwicoffin> Point blank seems kinda cool
[1:51:19] <ScreamLord> Looks like a BFG
[1:51:20] <rudiciuscaesar> @LaMystika dude, I am so sorry, can you get that fixed? Like, under warranty?
[1:51:40] <rudiciuscaesar> this is why I stopped at PS3 era and went to PC, I'm ok with switching out broken parts.
[1:51:41] <arkv01> @LaMystika soz dude that sucks to hear, I've also been constantly afraid my ps4 will die midway while playing this
[1:52:05] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, why? Is the game not meant to be played on a PS4 or is it just THAT taxing?
[1:52:15] <LaMystika> @rudiciuscaesar no longer under warranty, unfortunately. and my work hours have been reduced so I don’t have any disposable income atm
[1:52:25] <rudiciuscaesar> or was it a next gen game that they scaled down to make it fit into the aging PS4?
[1:52:34] <TonberryLives> Chadley's just a materia dipenser to me
[1:52:42] <arkv01> can't say for sure but my ps4 runs pretty hot while playing this
[1:52:46] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @PlagueOfGripes hi plague, love your stuff, how are you likeing the remake so far?
[1:52:51] <rudiciuscaesar> @LaMystika I am so sorry dude.
[1:53:02] <vonmaultke> if only they deleted Chadely
[1:53:07] <Lobster_Lord> just wait for the ps5 version that will include part 2, and be 60fps
[1:53:16] <Explodincatz> u should be able to respec anywhere
[1:53:21] <rudiciuscaesar> Chadley is probably just Nomura
[1:53:22] <Explodincatz> and not need chadle
[1:53:26] <arkv01> or if only chadley was a a 7 foot mr shakedown
[1:53:35] <rudiciuscaesar> Mr. SHAKEDOWNNNN
[1:53:39] <LaMystika> @rudiciuscaesar it’s fine. lessons were learned. good thing the Trials of Mana remake is on Switch, and Nojima isn’t writing it
[1:53:42] <mrgaster8> @arkv01 haha
[1:53:53] <mrgaster8> LUL
[1:54:03] <+Neoripo> Get asses
[1:54:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> damn, reports say PC port of this in May... 2021
[1:55:04] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes I think the robots are references to FF brooms
[1:55:33] <rudiciuscaesar> As an essential worker, I'm forced to see my best friend and her kids rely on unemployment, and whatever I can give them, so @LaMystika you have my sympathies on the PS4 front and the work front. Sorry to get all like, human and emotional.
[1:55:49] <rudiciuscaesar> WOAH HOJO looks like he's made out of leather.
[1:55:49] <+Neoripo> Oh no, this cutscene
[1:55:51] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa!
[1:55:59] <+XxBTExX> Lucretia + Hojo doujin when?
[1:56:01] <rudiciuscaesar> wait do you guys hear the theme.
[1:56:03] <+HawkGoggles2> How did anyone fuck Hojo?
[1:56:07] <rudiciuscaesar> they're just playing it now!?
[1:56:12] <turbofolk> YE YE YE YE YE GET THAT RED ROCKET GIRL
[1:56:16] <Huntercd> He don't wash his hands
[1:56:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> believe or not, Hojo was young once
[1:56:18] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Hojo looks even more shitty than he did in the OG and Dirge of Cerberus
[1:56:34] <SilverRoddo> OhMyDog
[1:56:50] <BillieNoMates> Hojo is amazing
[1:56:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> he's in his 50s and never took care of himself... also his face rigging is borked
[1:56:52] <TonberryLives> JESUS HOJO
[1:56:53] <arkv01> they made him giga creepy, good
[1:56:54] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> lucrecia was supposed to have been raped by hojo originally but they toned it down
[1:56:55] <ZE_Count> what a creepo
[1:56:55] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, wait how did they get her body?
[1:56:55] <+XxBTExX> he probably kept the pussy around as an onahole
[1:56:56] <Jigokuro> Hojo is still super skeezy
[1:56:56] <oniwahoo> Why is he rocking his hips? Dude
[1:56:57] <turbofolk> oh jesus
[1:57:01] <theloganbrand> Is Hojo a Simp?
[1:57:02] <Huntercd> He's getting off right now
[1:57:02] <f0rgeman> oh shit he gonna bust
[1:57:03] <rudiciuscaesar> Elmyra finds Aeris AND her mum.
[1:57:07] <xGeneralDOOM> he got a boner right now
[1:57:08] <Lobster_Lord> This chad cucked vincent
[1:57:10] <ScreamLord> It's his fffffffffffFFFFFFFFFETISH
[1:57:19] <+some_brave_apollo> lel
[1:57:24] <BillieNoMates> "The dog is warmed up"
[1:57:26] <TonberryLives> LUL
[1:57:27] <arkv01> LUL
[1:57:31] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, she took that like a champ.
[1:57:31] <+TheBigO75> lmao
[1:57:32] <Sol_Install> God I hate that with hotpockets
[1:57:32] <Explodincatz> LUL
[1:57:33] <PiCheese> LUL
[1:57:33] <arkv01> it's definitely an oven timer beep
[1:57:35] <Sokumotanaka> @Lobster_Lord We don't talk about dirge
[1:57:38] <antaresprt> She could smell him through the glass
[1:57:40] <oshkeet41> aeris: 'shit i was hungry too i want a hot pocket'
[1:57:42] <turbofolk> THE KNOT IS READY
[1:57:43] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Yeah @plagueofgripes sounded like a microwave
[1:57:43] <heroicspiritavenger> WE ARE PREPPING THE RED ROVER RIGHT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
[1:57:44] <rudiciuscaesar> pretty late, she called it.
[1:57:44] <TheWe4pon> was Hojo this creep in the original?
[1:57:45] <+XxBTExX> @Lobster_Lord yup... feelsbadman
[1:57:46] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Hojo looks like a child molester
[1:57:50] <@DCN2049> Every time hot pockets come up, I think of Jim Gaffigan's skit
[1:57:55] <oshkeet41> Hojo's always been super creepy
[1:58:01] <+Neoripo> Not so creep
[1:58:07] <SilverRoddo> 6 more FLoOrS
[1:58:09] <+Neoripo> but pretty creep
[1:58:09] <KaiserMario> Now guys, remember when you meet him chilling at the beach and you can't even punch him?
[1:58:16] <oniwahoo> @screamlord I mean, would that surprise you if he was?
[1:58:23] <Shwepie> Wait, was that a black guy? What's he doing up here?
[1:58:24] <arkv01> hojo is like that one crazy japanese dude who was abroad and went full cannibal on a woman
[1:58:26] <IntrepidEye> Hojo does try to force Aerith to fuck a catdog thing so yeah of course he's a creep
[1:58:29] <ScreamLord> @oniwahoo No
[1:58:45] <theloganbrand> It's a bolt-gun arm and a giant wrench obviously
[1:58:46] <rudiciuscaesar> Cloud could fit in, cuz he has a SOLDIER uniform on, Tifa could be considered a hooker but Barret with the firearm....
[1:58:52] <+UnwoundCaesar70> Yeah how is barret allowed anywhere with his gun arm
[1:58:55] <oshkeet41> Dude's always had an obvious Unit 731 vibe to him
[1:58:58] <arkv01> yeah barret is the sorest thumb
[1:59:00] <Sokumotanaka> Oh PLEASE let the weird springboard enemy still be here
[1:59:00] <%Samex_Comex> It's a nail gun
[1:59:01] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, sorry, an escort. Tifa looks like an escort.
[1:59:16] <arkv01> good idea, should be a decent stopping point soon
[1:59:21] <Vaiire> You'll get out when the cutscenes let you out.
[1:59:24] <oniwahoo> And into the habit of 12 hour streams *finger guns*
[1:59:25] <+Neoripo> yeah
[1:59:27] <Lobster_Lord> Tifa is canonically a hooker
[1:59:28] <LaMystika> Square Enix: maybe we shouldn’t have tried to push the envelope on graphics as much as we did. Also Square Enix: remakes a fragment of a game and makes it 88GB
[1:59:31] <rudiciuscaesar> Chapter Select should be active once you complete that chapter.
[1:59:49] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, wait, FF7R is 88GB?!
[1:59:54] <@DCN2049> Lengthy streams like that rob your logic and sanity and ruin your health. You don't need to go for long.
[1:59:56] <BillieNoMates> yep
[1:59:58] <rudiciuscaesar> my moded Skyrim is like 60GB
[1:59:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes, uncompressed art assets
[1:59:59] <turbofolk> no its 100 GB
[2:00:03] <jon651> You missed purple pain?
[2:00:04] <BillieNoMates> Itsa big game
[2:00:12] <+Neoripo> yes
[2:00:16] <Monstergelo> we fight rufus yet?
[2:00:16] <@DCN2049> no, it's 85.823 gb
[2:00:23] <rudiciuscaesar> save bloat it looks like.
[2:00:29] <@DCN2049> stop spouting the media's lies.
[2:00:32] <+XxBTExX> Ghastly
[2:00:38] <TonberryLives> The physical edition comes with two discs: a data disc that installs first then a play disc
[2:00:40] <mrgaster8> yes
[2:00:42] <Lobster_Lord> FF7 would be boring without Hojo
[2:00:45] <GiygasDrillBreak> undertale named Gast after FF7 Gast
[2:00:49] <LaMystika> it was 87-88 for me. and I thought 50 for Nier Automata was big before.
[2:00:55] <BillieNoMates> Probably a reference to FF7
[2:00:58] <rudiciuscaesar> Wait, @TonberryLives it's a two disc game?
[2:01:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes Undertale, the game built on referencing video games, references FF7, how shocking
[2:01:14] <Jigokuro> Nah, Gaster is G. Aster, it is a font thing like the others.
[2:01:19] <SuperVaderMan> RED LORD
[2:01:21] <@DCN2049> I'm looking at the download now. it's 85.823
[2:01:24] <ZE_Count> wanna drink da sweet sweet Redlord
[2:01:26] <+jiggy_snipe> EXTREME
[2:01:33] <Explodincatz> EXPLOSIVE FLAVOR
[2:01:33] <BillieNoMates> I like the adverts/brands
[2:01:34] <rudiciuscaesar> shoot the glass
[2:01:38] <heroicspiritavenger> Should have called it BOMB ASS ENERGY
[2:01:38] <arkv01> crimson comet drink
[2:01:40] <+Neoripo> You don't
[2:01:40] <TonberryLives> No not really. This first one just does the install
[2:01:41] <oshkeet41> FF7 Gast's named after a family restaurant. So its ike the Domino joke.
[2:01:49] <oshkeet41> It'd be like calling him professor Applebees.
[2:01:52] <samuelfisk> Crimson King Cola
[2:02:09] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao Professor Applebees is awesome.
[2:02:14] <%Samex_Comex> Oh boy food
[2:02:17] <rudiciuscaesar> why ain't none of these women thicc.
[2:02:22] <+jiggy_snipe> LOL
[2:02:24] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I think FF7R is more of a soft reboot and less of a remake
[2:02:29] <Lobster_Lord> The generic NPCs look so bad and out of place
[2:02:40] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's a sequel
[2:02:53] <examplez0> Undertale Gaster's theme was inspired by FF's "Who are you?" theme
[2:03:04] <mrgaster8> you can buy weapons their
[2:03:05] <GiygasDrillBreak> Heidigger really should have been voiced by Brian Blessed
[2:03:07] <fillmydarksoulwithlight> how does anyone even believe him
[2:03:08] <turbofolk> Dont the main characters models look bigger than the generic NPC's
[2:03:11] <antaresprt> Dude looks like Bluto
[2:03:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> he doesnt even laugh, they messed up Heidigger
[2:03:21] <+zackalan> "Here with me today: Kilgore McMurderface."
[2:03:22] <oshkeet41> IIRC his offical name is Gast Fametsu, so its literally GUsto the Family Restaurant
[2:03:27] <mrgaster8> later
[2:03:31] <LaMystika> I don’t even know how to feel about Undertale
[2:03:55] <+HawkGoggles2> How's the Mayor? Mayo? *walks away*
[2:03:58] <arran_throttle> well, yeah, he is a black guy
[2:04:07] <+jiggy_snipe> yea these npcs don't look great lol
[2:04:14] <LaMystika> other than I don’t like the whole “here’s multiple paths you can take” then telling you there’s only one “correct” way to play
[2:04:21] <rudiciuscaesar> this reminds me of the city hospital near me, being up on the 10th floor, looking out onto the city, it's kinda pretty
[2:04:22] <+jiggy_snipe> he's stressed
[2:04:24] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah but having bodies to point to helps plague like cloud and them exist and it helps when people say "where the people?"
[2:04:24] <mrgaster8> sad boy
[2:04:25] <turbofolk> Sonic 2006 npc's
[2:04:35] <antaresprt> That janitor dude in the restaurant seems suspicious
[2:04:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> I said THE MAYOR
[2:05:02] <Livelinne> But why dress them normally?? woolieREMEMBERS
[2:05:03] <mrgaster8> hahaha
[2:05:04] <examplez0> FFX had better looking NPCs
[2:05:06] <turbofolk> oh boi another place for max to pad out his stream
[2:05:15] <Shwepie> All the background characters are kind of dirty/muddy looking despite not actually being covered in filthy.
[2:05:18] <rudiciuscaesar> FFX did have good looking NPCs, ridiculous ones but good ones
[2:05:20] <GeltonZ> They call this combat sim "The Grinding Area"
[2:05:31] <oniwahoo> Ava-Lanche!
[2:05:36] <rudiciuscaesar> can't move the tables though....
[2:05:38] <oshkeet41> Ava-lawnchair
[2:05:43] <vonmaultke> Avalanche Chair war LUL
[2:05:51] <rudiciuscaesar> look at that dude's shoes.
[2:05:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> remember when Aeris slammed a chair on a guy? good times
[2:05:59] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:06:00] <oshkeet41> p sure i wouldnt wanna go to any floor in the Shinra Building called 'the grinding area'
[2:06:02] <samuelfisk> Well Hell House shot chairs
[2:06:07] <examplez0> It's the guy outside the VR simulation
[2:06:09] <+some_brave_apollo> As in mare
[2:06:13] <oniwahoo> Mayor Mare
[2:06:13] <ScreamLord> Wait, Horses exist in FF7?
[2:06:16] <vonmaultke> LUL maybe the mayor is horse faced?
[2:06:18] <arkv01> juicy theme
[2:06:20] <turbofolk> japanese pun that only on japanese i bet
[2:06:25] <+HawkGoggles2> Scarlet's theme? Horny day is over.
[2:06:25] <examplez0> Giant flying seahorses exist
[2:06:31] <examplez0> So why not regular horses
[2:06:35] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:06:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> yes, aint you see the Odin summon? horses exist
[2:06:47] <ScreamLord> Toadstools tho
[2:06:52] <%Samex_Comex> I will never sit again :(
[2:06:52] <rudiciuscaesar> couldn't even tell you the gender of the person you're looking for.
[2:06:54] <examplez0> That guy in front of the door is the informant
[2:06:59] <examplez0> Is the guy you're looking for
[2:07:03] <Owkono> mushrooms are just tiny stools
[2:07:06] <+CrimsonDio11> plague the item shop should have a cloud weapon
[2:07:07] <examplez0> Of the blue dome
[2:07:09] <oniwahoo> Tifa is actually the informant
[2:07:12] <turbofolk> example had enough
[2:07:30] <TheWe4pon> There are unique accessories in the combat sim if you care
[2:07:36] <+whiskey_wolfe_> holy shit a black guy
[2:07:40] <+jiggy_snipe> and kicking chairs
[2:08:00] <%CyberDingus> leave NO CHAIR untouched!!
[2:08:06] <ZE_Count> item shop upstairs
[2:08:07] <arkv01> LUL this is the most sus way to find an informant
[2:08:10] <oshkeet41> Emergent Gameplay: CHAIRS
[2:08:14] <%caramello_man> These chairs have NO honour!
[2:08:15] <oniwahoo> Chairish these memories
[2:08:17] <examplez0> Chadley should be around here somewhere
[2:08:18] <Lobster_Lord> FF7 validates false flag conspiracy theories
[2:08:30] <+Neoripo> not yet
[2:08:35] <turbofolk> What was the point of having physic enable objects if you aren't gonna be using them to do shit, fucking DOOM had the same problem
[2:08:39] <mrgaster8> colder
[2:08:41] <+Neoripo> Chad will spawn SOON
[2:08:54] <examplez0> Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
[2:09:10] <+XxBTExX> guessing on the 2nd floor or one of the guys lying down
[2:09:29] <%caramello_man> Gotta catch 'em all
[2:09:31] <OToole42> anti social scrubs
[2:09:44] <%CyberDingus> DON'T FUCK CHADLEE
[2:09:53] <OToole42> what if they retcon it so chadley is controlling cait sith?
[2:09:56] <Shwepie> @turbofolk Physics objects are just considered a standard feature of games now. It's the curse of progress.
[2:10:03] <arkv01> these office workers are fighting bahamut in the simulator
[2:10:04] <seth45er> oh get some caramel slice
[2:10:09] <OToole42> I'd just go live in the woods behind my house
[2:10:17] <examplez0> Oh Chaddy where art thou
[2:10:34] <%caramello_man> @seth45er yeah love that caramel slice
[2:10:36] <OToole42> cut myself off from all worldly posessions and communication
[2:10:39] <+Neoripo> Oh, so you can not buy Tifa's weapon
[2:10:46] <TheWe4pon> wait thats the stuff you win in the sim
[2:11:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> Part 1 has bracers with 2+1+1, the power creep means Part 2 will have bracers with 2+2+2+2+2+2 slots
[2:11:16] <arkv01> thats for the "fuck materia" fights
[2:11:41] <crusader_raul> How many hours in are ya?
[2:11:59] <turbofolk> @Shwepie They are cancer, i rather disable them than accidentally kick them and hear how they start bashing against the games floor, the noise they make is annoying
[2:12:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> better yet, Part 2 throws a curveball, introduces 3-link slots
[2:12:07] <mrgaster8> your so close
[2:12:13] <mrgaster8> yeaa
[2:12:17] <oshkeet41> haha
[2:12:27] <+some_brave_apollo> this fucking busywork
[2:12:31] <Shwepie> @GiygasDrillBreak That or they'll just not transfer anything over to Part 2 and you'll start from scratch.
[2:12:35] <mrgaster8> have fun
[2:12:35] <%caramello_man> "haha, now fight!"
[2:12:36] <+jiggy_snipe> lol
[2:12:40] <+HawkGoggles2> "Do you know how long it's been since you've been in a fight" Kappa
[2:12:41] <%Samex_Comex> Bitch we fought Hell house!
[2:12:42] <OToole42> Chet
[2:12:45] <rudiciuscaesar> Chad-san
[2:12:49] <+whiskey_wolfe_> pad pad pad
[2:12:50] <+jiggy_snipe> Chadworth Kappa
[2:12:51] <+zackalan> I love that they have a combat simulator right next to the JambaJuice
[2:12:53] <crusader_raul> XMen Danger Room??
[2:12:54] <+Neoripo> I hope chair accompany you
[2:12:55] <examplez0> Any excuse to keep padding the fuck out of the game
[2:12:59] <turbofolk> they'll metroid you when FF7R 2 launches
[2:13:02] <+Neoripo> DAMMIT!
[2:13:02] <mrgaster8> he a bob
[2:13:05] <+some_brave_apollo> nah holodecks can do it
[2:13:07] <%caramello_man> nah they give you a controller
[2:13:17] <+RaveBV> Yeah, he's more of a Chet or Chadworth. He fits the template of Chad but never realized the potential of a Chad.
[2:13:19] <arkv01> why do they have a combat simulator and not a sex holodeck
[2:13:28] <arkv01> the hell are these office workers doing
[2:13:35] <turbofolk> Im telling DONALD and GOOFY will be in part 2
[2:13:40] <oniwahoo> It's bigger on the inside, y'all, don't worry about it
[2:13:50] <turbofolk> at this point anything goes
[2:13:52] <oshkeet41> the sexlouge is probably a special keycard
[2:14:01] <+Neoripo> It may use Holodeck tech
[2:14:02] <oshkeet41> im not even sure im joking about that being plausible
[2:14:08] <OToole42> when you want to just deck Jimmy from Accounting, but want to avoid HR. TRY A COMBAT SIM
[2:14:11] <GiygasDrillBreak> FYI, simulators are supposed to be neural, not star trek replicators
[2:15:35] <+Neoripo> You can do more combat after this
[2:15:50] <oshkeet41> he just looks like someone who'd cut.

[2:16:38] <+Neoripo> Chad is creeping
[2:17:12] <arkv01> you may try to escape nomura's grasp, but he has a firm grip on your flaccid pp
[2:17:13] <oniwahoo> No one will notice Chad meeting with BARRET because he totally blends in this environment
