[0:07:16] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah me neither
[0:07:35] <Spagheddies> Listen, when you can afford a tablet, you gotta learn to use what you have.
[0:07:43] <DragoniusMaximus> Ive seen some legitimately professional tier artists draw with mouse, its something else
[0:08:19] <%Murphio_GS> The spongebob squarepants of the world
[0:08:24] <%Zig95> you should stream on here more plague. picarto freezes a lot on my phone.

[0:09:20] <+JohntheBarbarian> ironmouseWow
[0:09:50] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah, sounds about right
[0:09:55] <Angerest> tech is fast
[0:09:59] <WFN_Art> Time to finish chapter 2 ! Perhaps ! Maybe ! Unlikely.
[0:10:21] <$SGrim> My god
[0:10:21] <reonome> its in minutes

[0:10:45] <DragoniusMaximus> Berdly is the horrible bird man
[0:10:59] <Coystick> The queen's amazing butt
[0:11:19] <DragoniusMaximus> Im sure rule 34 artists are already having a field day with her
[0:11:47] <dakotachipmath> Cummies
[0:11:53] <WFN_Art> I'd say a good 3-4 hours left ?
[0:12:07] <dakotachipmath> Skullfucking?
[0:12:08] <%KellBeII> Choo Chooo HypeTongue
[0:12:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> A hole for "mice"
[0:12:41] <DragoniusMaximus> even though im not the biggest fan of these games, the soundtracks never fails to be amazing
[0:13:41] <dakotachipmath> Mmm mmm.
[0:13:43] <%Murphio_GS> Skull moon cummies
[0:13:48] <dakotachipmath> UwU
[0:13:52] <Broand> There's two ways to solve that puzzle
[0:14:15] <ManfredA> this chapter is a bit more like Undertale in certain ways
[0:15:42] <dakotachipmath> Yeah the designs are way more out there.
[0:15:48] <+vague_ex> White-mage-ish?
[0:15:51] <DragoniusMaximus> yeah they definitely went really out there with the designs in this chapter
[0:15:53] <terrasonny1> Kinda what?? lol
[0:15:53] <%Murphio_GS> Flowey white dress
[0:15:59] <Futurecity10> more of a priestest vibe
[0:16:03] <ManfredA> It's definitely intentional
[0:16:04] <DragoniusMaximus> i heard toby hired a couple of guest artists to design some too
[0:16:21] <DragoniusMaximus> like i think those three music dudes were a guest design?
[0:16:33] <%Murphio_GS> Her dad is sick
[0:16:35] <ManfredA> her dad's sick and noone knows why
[0:16:38] <+vague_ex> I think he's just "sick"
[0:16:57] <dakotachipmath> Holy Feces
[0:17:19] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah clowns are just kinda lame
[0:17:28] <Broand> You weren't clown adjacent, and you weren't also around during the clown golden age
[0:17:51] <%Murphio_GS> Internet clown memes also help
[0:17:57] <+RoosterSauces> Clowns are sophisticated humor
[0:18:06] <Broand> Doe they?
[0:18:35] <%Murphio_GS> LOOK
[0:19:06] <Broand> Right is progress
[0:19:08] <ManfredA> apparently the next 3 will be a package deal so it's possible that aspects of part 2 were just very intensive, assets-wise
[0:19:31] <+vague_ex> NYOMP
[0:19:35] <%Murphio_GS> Deer likes purple dinosaur
[0:19:39] <dakotachipmath> Sousaphone
[0:19:49] <Broand> that chalky fresh breath...
[0:19:50] <Coystick> Sir pls
[0:20:07] <%Murphio_GS> Look at ralsei be cute
[0:20:15] <+vague_ex> I've never enjoyed cotton candy
[0:20:21] <Broand> Side path to the left fyi
[0:20:30] <dakotachipmath> Who's the most fuckable Deltarune character tho
[0:20:39] <%Murphio_GS> Cotton candy from the fair is always awesome even though most other fair foods suck
[0:21:04] <DragoniusMaximus> i do really like the design of the wire dudes
[0:21:06] <+vague_ex> Remember you can use shift to go faster~
[0:21:08] <dakotachipmath> @Murphio_GS fair food should be good. Maybe the fairs you've been to just had shit food :o
[0:22:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:22:24] <dakotachipmath> Who ARE you lol
[0:22:25] <theloganbrand> The virgin coded girl next door
[0:22:57] <DragoniusMaximus> they know each other so well thats why they had no interactions in chapter 1 lol
[0:22:57] <Broand> where does the goatboy come into the equation
[0:22:57] <ManfredA> what about Ralsei
[0:23:09] <%Murphio_GS> Abstract concepts are kinda hot ngl
[0:23:16] <dakotachipmath> Ralsei is the soft twink everyone pegs and uses as a foot stool.
[0:23:17] <dakotachipmath> or something
[0:23:58] <cap_bon> fluffy boy will never betray us D:
[0:24:26] <ManfredA> Kris isn't really implied to be a wholesome person before I guess
[0:24:30] <%Murphio_GS> I like this joke
[0:24:36] <Khester824> We will have to obliterate Ralsei
[0:25:42] <thelonechris> The humor is so stupid, I love it
[0:25:46] <Bennett_Fracture> hey you got a white mage... they're useful...
[0:25:51] <Streamers_Psychosis> FEET
[0:25:54] <%Murphio_GS> Foot looker
[0:25:55] <cap_bon> I like Queen way more as an antagonist than that other guy
[0:26:14] <DragoniusMaximus> this design reminds me of a game id play in elementary school teaching me about medicine
[0:27:11] <Broand> side path to the left, or progress south
[0:27:13] <%Murphio_GS> Go back and then down
[0:27:40] <dakotachipmath> OHHH. I kept lowering the quality of the stream thinkin it was on my end.
[0:27:57] <cap_bon> Frame chan please
[0:28:00] <%Murphio_GS> I meant back from the street sorry
[0:28:34] <Randomdoodbro> You can look at the ferris wheel sign.
[0:29:01] <Broand> Make grazing easier
[0:29:40] <Broand> To the right, south exit in the room with the dude selling shoes
[0:31:13] <%0ni0n_L0rd> oh shit. he's doing it
[0:31:20] <%Murphio_GS> No, I am not a cat
[0:31:33] <%Mizaiya> Not if its packing peanuts
[0:31:35] <Broand> the ikea special
[0:31:44] <cap_bon> Theres always spiders in there even if you think its empty
[0:31:57] <+YabbaTroll> xenomorph
[0:32:01] <+YabbaTroll> ye
[0:32:31] <%Mizaiya> for japan i imagine its wwwwwww
[0:32:34] <%0ni0n_L0rd> Yeah it's great
[0:32:39] <+blastyoboots> it's extrapolating fancy Elizabeth II hair from a queen playing card into, like, the entire head shape, thus xenomorph somehow
[0:32:42] <+YabbaTroll> oh god I thought that was my computer shitting itself
[0:32:59] <dakotachipmath> Quality seems fine. Audio isn't hiccuping at all either. Its just visuals stuttering ocas.sionally
[0:33:08] <%Murphio_GS> For french it's Mrrdrr
[0:33:13] <%Murphio_GS> and variations of that
[0:33:13] <theloganbrand> The sitcom? Smartboy?
[0:33:41] <%0ni0n_L0rd> YES.
[0:34:02] <%Murphio_GS> Would you with Queen?
[0:34:04] <dakotachipmath> Wut
[0:34:07] <Broand> THAT AINT FALCO
[0:34:23] <dakotachipmath> Why is that buff gold duck wearing a diaaper
[0:34:30] <falyden> omg he's got crocs
[0:34:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kreygasm
[0:34:42] <dakotachipmath> NO NOT THE CROCS
[0:34:44] <%Garrtoon> I had the same exact reaction in this scene, boss
[0:34:46] <+blastyoboots> Yeah, that would be pretty strange!
[0:34:53] <+RoosterSauces> Be the change you want to see in the world
[0:34:53] <%Mizaiya> Nah it just cuts to a live action cutscene
[0:34:58] <DragoniusMaximus> Yeah that would be pretty funny haha
[0:35:17] <+Prince_Kaboom> you could drtaw it for them
[0:35:55] <+YabbaTroll> he wearing crocs too
[0:36:04] <FirewallStorm> nice IQ diaper
[0:36:08] <+ConLin_Arts_> You can only dream of having nipples
[0:36:10] <ryderbootz> wouldnt it be a little quirky if the game just told you your full name, address, and social security number?
[0:36:32] <+silvery_cricket> VIDEDOGAMES
[0:36:36] <DragoniusMaximus> I have never experienced such a punchable character in a long time, good job bird man
[0:36:43] <Coystick> Come back hot Shodan
[0:36:52] <Coystick> hotter* Shodan
[0:36:53] <+vague_ex> :)

[0:37:27] <StencilOST> Dont be jealous of the ideal man
[0:37:28] <DragoniusMaximus> why is he wearing a diaper
[0:37:36] <+ThomasOfTroy> I think toes
[0:37:36] <Spagheddies> It's up to interpretation.
[0:37:37] <loukemia83> Why is he wearing a diaper?
[0:37:39] <Streamers_Psychosis> cankles
[0:37:46] <+YabbaTroll> maybe he has that type of leg?
[0:37:46] <+ConLin_Arts_> Gamer Diaper
[0:37:52] <+YabbaTroll> like goat style
[0:37:57] <StencilOST> how often do you think about daipers
[0:37:59] <Broand> it's the stringy armed music crew
[0:38:02] <+YabbaTroll> i forget the name but I feel like you would know
[0:38:26] <+silvery_cricket> Mine says "Pog Lmao"
[0:38:40] <Broand> Extra comfort at the most trying of moments, Gamer Diapers
[0:38:50] <falyden> speed tech diapers
[0:39:09] <loukemia83> ooooooo they built that
[0:39:12] <%Murphio_GS> Healing items
[0:39:29] <Broand> Christmas racism
[0:39:31] <+BlueLunecy> That's what Pat said
[0:39:33] <sosuke5> a little
[0:39:33] <%Murphio_GS> I hope so
[0:39:36] <Srthunda> it might be a little racist
[0:39:38] <loukemia83> Holiday
[0:39:41] <loukemia83> right?
[0:39:47] <terrasonny1> Dude leave the car with feet alone
[0:39:50] <%maelyll> Very
[0:39:55] <+silvery_cricket> NO DONT WALK INTO TRAFFIC
[0:40:24] <+silvery_cricket> Oh she is a "white" mage
[0:40:26] <%Murphio_GS> NO NOELLE DONT SAY IT
[0:40:42] <Refermaned> noelle action
[0:40:45] <Broand> It's a generic action that is enemy specific
[0:41:10] <%Murphio_GS> maybe they do tho
[0:41:13] <%Murphio_GS> ever tried it?
[0:41:13] <cap_bon> So is there any reason to not jsut avoid as much combat as possible
[0:41:29] <StencilOST> they do keep appearing.
[0:41:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> you do get money
[0:41:48] <+ConLin_Arts_> to use for items and stuffs
[0:41:48] <Refermaned> you still get money for completing fights
[0:41:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> ye
[0:41:55] <17sevens> @cap_bon you get money, and also recruit enemies up until a certain point for sparing
[0:42:15] <%Murphio_GS> Just one shoe lol
[0:42:23] <+blastyoboots> i mean hooves
[0:42:26] <Broand> she's hoofing it
[0:42:27] <vilecrois> it's HOOVES
[0:42:30] <loukemia83> Hoves are like shoes but it's your toenails
[0:42:42] <+silvery_cricket> If this was a real city there be shattered glass everywhere on the ground from rogue drunks
[0:42:52] <TheAntiNihilist> You will get so much money you might as well impulse buy everything you want
[0:43:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:43:22] <+silvery_cricket> Oh look a weapon you will never use
[0:44:04] <+silvery_cricket> Might as well let the player duel wield shields if you just never will allow them to attack
[0:44:21] <+YabbaTroll> I think some weapons increase def
[0:44:31] <StencilOST> i think weapons might have some useful skills
[0:44:40] <cap_bon> hmmm
[0:44:57] <cap_bon> Haha
[0:44:57] <Refermaned> ???
[0:44:59] <TheAntiNihilist> ???

[0:48:49] <+silvery_cricket> try and walk between the graffiti and the dumpster
[0:48:55] <Broand> go up
[0:48:56] <%Murphio_GS> Go up
[0:48:58] <+blastyoboots> the special notes on the deltarune website had Toby saying that the game is full of garbage and you'll find him sleeping at the bottom of the trash
[0:48:59] <+silvery_cricket> probably an invisible wall or some stupid shit like that
[0:49:05] <+blastyoboots> so that was this probably
[0:49:22] <TubeMan642> go up and right
[0:49:32] <TheAntiNihilist> interesting because I called the phone right here as well
[0:49:48] <%Murphio_GS> Dollar, not collar
[0:49:49] <+JGardner03> Dollar
[0:49:52] <+blastyoboots> Dogecoin
[0:50:19] <Broand> Nah you can go up from the redcarway
[0:50:20] <+silvery_cricket> Can you walk between traffic?
[0:50:24] <+JGardner03> Go up left first
[0:50:55] <sosuke5> no, up
[0:51:00] <+silvery_cricket> No Plague everything Toby makes is magical and perfect, stop having criticsm
[0:51:04] <%Murphio_GS> I suggest going up on the red car road instead
[0:51:04] <FistTheWizard> you can go up at the red cars
[0:51:07] <Broand> keep going up on the red car way
[0:51:17] <+JGardner03> That was for the secret, actual path is top left first
[0:51:18] <+silvery_cricket> Because Quirky Plague
[0:51:27] <Khotgor> Did you find your muffet yet to make your fanart over? HypeWho
[0:51:30] <Broand> NO I mean further up

[0:51:40] <LunarRemix> Right up
[0:51:41] <+BigCoffee> up and then right
[0:51:41] <FistTheWizard> right
[0:51:47] <+silvery_cricket> walk up yellow traffic
[0:52:15] <vilecrois> exit is up right but you have to get there by a sorta roundabout way
[0:52:17] <+silvery_cricket> there will be no cars on the white lines
[0:52:24] <Refermaned> up left up right
[0:52:29] <Broand> Go up on the red side
[0:52:31] <sosuke5> up the road with red cars
[0:52:36] <LunarRemix> Go back left and then up right
[0:52:53] <+JGardner03> You actually cannot go that way at all, go further up from the stop with 2 buttons
[0:52:55] <Puhff> Red car side
[0:53:05] <TheAntiNihilist> dig up stupid
[0:53:35] <+silvery_cricket> So Quirky hahahahaha
[0:53:43] <TheAntiNihilist> ME TOO

[0:54:27] <+whim5> haha yeah memorable...
[0:54:34] <LunarRemix> It's good.
[0:54:35] <Khotgor> Undertale generally lacks substance HypeWho
[0:55:25] <17sevens> press down on any of the lights to release the mice
[0:55:32] <Broand> Nah you can just press down when you're moving the things around
[0:57:00] <+mrzimmer5> lmao ive never seen that

[1:02:04] <Coystick> You could live in, uh, Canada -hurk-
[1:02:05] <jerree66> You could be in Mississippi
[1:02:06] <Khotgor> Yeah. you could be living in California acidsp1Sip
[1:02:07] <laserbeaming> As long as it's not Ohio
[1:02:12] <+Mendin> Could be ohio
[1:02:13] <%Murphio_GS> That's also a general american problem tbh
[1:02:18] <+Mendin> oh ffs

[1:02:26] <fluffy_sauce> Could be worse. It could be living in mississippi
[1:02:34] <fluffy_sauce> He could*
[1:03:00] <+mrzimmer5> *cries in TX heat*
[1:03:04] <Futurecity10> bro same
[1:03:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> What humidity though?
[1:03:07] <TheAntiNihilist> Columbus is fancy. Cleveland is hell.  and the weather always is not quite right.  Welcome to Ohio
[1:03:09] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah same
[1:03:15] <Khotgor> Dry Heat is better than Humid Heat. But the cold is superior
[1:03:16] <%Murphio_GS> I wouldn't mind moving to Canada
[1:03:16] <fluffy_sauce> 29C
[1:03:19] <Coystick> That's too fucking warm mate
[1:03:21] <jerree66> christ
[1:03:21] <rittergeist> What about Oklahoma, everybody forgets about Oklahoma.
[1:03:23] <fluffy_sauce> which is hot
[1:03:29] <+mrzimmer5> damn 80? I have mine set to 75 and im in TX
[1:03:32] <Broand> 20c is hot temperature in ireland
[1:03:33] <laserbeaming> 42 C would be unbearably hot
[1:03:35] <+mrzimmer5> id die with 80
[1:03:44] <+Ravendusk> 42 C is way too much
[1:03:49] <Coystick> 29c is a smidge above comfy temp
[1:03:54] <GnollAUS> 42c, I have been in that sort of heat here in Australia.
[1:04:03] <Happysobek> 42C aussie summer
[1:04:13] <Mathochism> It was like, 110F here last week. Good times.\
[1:04:17] <fluffy_sauce> anything above 20C is hot
[1:04:18] <wolfen091> invest in a window unit maybe?
[1:04:50] <%Murphio_GS> I remember Where the Red Fern grows, loved that book as a kid
[1:05:04] <+Mendin> If you wanna move from hot farmland in the  middle of nowhere to colder farmland in the middle of nowhere, I recommend west-central PA
[1:05:27] <GnollAUS> I have gone to New Zeland and America from Australia.
[1:05:33] <TheAntiNihilist> Lol timed
[1:05:39] <wolfen091> ever thought of moving up near pat and paige?
[1:06:05] <LunarRemix> You can do the puzzle while he talks
[1:06:06] <Coystick> Sometimes I think video games have completely dulled my desire to travel, because my dad could never sit still, but I've never felt a single pang of wanderlust.
[1:06:09] <TheAntiNihilist> Ignore him…
[1:06:12] <laserbeaming> You can solve it while he speaks
[1:06:15] <%Murphio_GS> Dont read his dialogue just do it
[1:06:18] <Khotgor> It's solveable, you just aren't solving it LUL
[1:06:28] <LunarRemix> They are
[1:06:30] <laserbeaming> they are completable
[1:06:32] <TubeMan642> yes
[1:06:34] <%Murphio_GS> Sent them to her
[1:06:34] <Khotgor> PAige solved all of these puzzles, BTW
[1:06:41] <shabayum> Kentucky brain
[1:06:48] <TubeMan642> they are
[1:06:48] <+Mendin> Plague you're turning into Paige
[1:06:58] <+Mendin> how can this be?
[1:07:01] <TheAntiNihilist> Understandable
[1:07:14] <Refermaned> the bottom wall has arrows
[1:07:20] <k_tyke> Would've been cool if Deltarune was about trying to spare enemies while managing a party member that goes in for the kill
[1:07:36] <laserbeaming> no one ever reads that. Don't worry you didn't miss much
[1:07:45] <laserbeaming> just Berdly being annoying
[1:07:56] <%Murphio_GS> Berdley is being a bitch
[1:08:01] <Khotgor> @Mendin This is an incorrect sentence; Paige did it all perfectly Kappa
[1:08:07] <Ardailec> Berdley 3rd wheeling all over your date
[1:08:21] <+RoosterSauces> Same
[1:08:22] <+faytthepally> Yum yum protein
[1:08:24] <Khotgor> Yes, and sheep can also eat meat
[1:08:25] <copyritetm> I've seen horses do that to baby chicks as well
[1:09:07] <+faytthepally> cute > edge
[1:09:11] <Broand> DARK EDGY ALT UNIVERSE PAPYRUS
[1:09:26] <Broand> Snark was always the enemy
[1:09:26] <Khotgor> Hey look, a Mimic enemy acidsp1Sip
[1:09:32] <Treasure_Vault> Anyone mention how close the name Toby Fox is to Tony Hawk?
[1:09:41] <Treasure_Vault> Probably the same dude, tbh
[1:10:21] <+Mendin> Oh hey one of those pop-up was an amalgam face
[1:10:32] <k_tyke> @Treasure_Vault Is that a Game Theory?
[1:10:35] <Mastahopo> just yer everyman
[1:10:52] <Khotgor> Mimic enemies are useless
[1:11:03] <Treasure_Vault> Chest Mimics and Mimics are entirely different species
[1:11:11] <Treasure_Vault> Mimics mimic chests.
[1:11:20] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah
[1:11:21] <Treasure_Vault> Chest mimics live in chests.
[1:11:35] <+blastyoboots> he was saying that HE would solve the trap and save her
[1:11:37] <Treasure_Vault> Like Sea horses live in the sea.
[1:11:46] <Treasure_Vault> And seagulls live in the sea.
[1:12:00] <+mrzimmer5> Berdly is being tricked into thinking he's the hero and he's saving Noelle from Kris
[1:12:00] <TheAntiNihilist> Yup
[1:12:06] <Broand> He's falco
[1:12:21] <+mrzimmer5> and Noelle has a microscopic spine so she can't explain anything on her own
[1:12:29] <cooldude69xx> Thats how I felt about Soda boy
[1:12:44] <ArcanaArcade> He's a douchie character
[1:12:46] <%Artista_AF> yeah that's basically his whole character
[1:12:52] <peachy996> Great theme though
[1:12:57] <Khotgor> Falco characters are overrated. Why are all blue birds such assholes? LUL LUL LUL
[1:13:01] <%Murphio_GS> He uses tonados because he's a bird
[1:13:09] <%Murphio_GS> and bird=wind
[1:13:12] <+vague_ex> 👀
[1:13:29] <Khotgor> At least he isn't trying to use his wings to somehow shoot a fucking bow LUL LUL LUL
[1:13:36] <Refermaned> watch your heart
[1:15:02] <+blastyoboots> it's less "bird is tornado" and more "Storm Eagle from Megaman X", his falco suit also half-resembling X power armor upgrades
[1:15:19] <ArcanaArcade> wow it had text because of how quick you got rid of his team lol
[1:15:20] <jerree66> only if you do the other run
[1:15:22] <%Murphio_GS> you can kill them if you want to, that's it
[1:15:24] <+vague_ex> :)
[1:15:27] <copyritetm> It depends on whether you want to be a jerk or not
[1:15:28] <TheAntiNihilist> Yes. There is no point to spare reeeally
[1:15:29] <Mastahopo> :( ...
[1:15:30] <Refermaned> if you want to do a no spare run
[1:15:31] <+mrzimmer5> yes, but that way is spoilers
[1:15:32] <Khotgor> Please kill Berdly LUL LUL LUL
[1:15:34] <jerree66> too late for that
[1:15:35] <Captain0Punz> yes
[1:15:38] <17sevens> You get stronger for losing them, and also alternate route
[1:15:39] <Randomdoodbro> It can make them tired sometimes
[1:15:43] <Broand> Is that a question you want an answer for?
[1:15:46] <TheAntiNihilist> You can’t kill in this game!!!
[1:15:47] <Spagheddies> You can tire them if you do enough damage to them, but besides that, it's just for the other run.
[1:16:04] <+mrzimmer5> but in pacifist you can damage enemies to make them tired
[1:16:22] <Khotgor> The Spare/Kill element in undertale is just another variant of the same moral system of good/evil used in other games. It's generally meh
[1:16:30] <copyritetm> Don't worry Plague, the whole mechanic is a fake out in this game for the actual alternate route
[1:16:33] <+blastyoboots> I didn't think it served a point either, but changed my mind a bit
[1:16:39] <Mastahopo> there is a way for the story to get F'd up  but i would try to not analyze this game LIKE undertale
[1:16:45] <+blastyoboots> @copyritetm you don't have to give specific details
[1:16:53] <TheAntiNihilist> I killed berdly here. Doesn’t change the story
[1:16:56] <copyritetm> @copyritetm I wont
[1:17:12] <ArcanaArcade> I mean it's an option to play how you wanna
[1:17:21] <shiny_prinny> in Ch 1 fighting enemies just made them run, won't really know if that matters until the game is fully out i think
[1:17:52] <ExpressNode> It is pretty hard. Tried the touhous and the wrecked me real good
[1:18:15] <copyritetm> Shmups are just hard mode versions of that board game Operation
[1:18:26] <Khotgor> Undertale/delta is a lot easier than some Japanese shooters for sure
[1:19:23] <+BedHome> whats stream policy on spoilers that explain options
[1:19:38] <+BedHome> like things that exist but the game *does not* tell you
[1:19:49] <+BedHome> they are watching you, personally
[1:19:55] <%Murphio_GS> Yes knitting caps are for dumbos
[1:20:07] <Khotgor> Were your hats based off of the Legend of Zelda? acidsp1Sip
[1:20:22] <Coystick> Oh no, Halberd, Berdly. I hate it
[1:20:37] <shiny_prinny> oh i didn't even realize that
[1:20:41] <+blastyoboots> I mean, Japan uses a bunch of English word puns all the time
[1:20:45] <+blastyoboots> and we use Spanish puns and such
[1:20:50] <Khotgor> Well, Bird is the Word after all Kappa
[1:20:52] <%Murphio_GS> Supposedly it used to be brid
[1:20:53] <MugenSandan> I love to wake up and hear the robins go BIRD BIRD BIRD BIRD
[1:21:00] <%Murphio_GS> and the i and r got switched
[1:21:12] <+BedHome> Halbard in japanese is "Haarubaado"
[1:21:13] <TheAntiNihilist> Stick it to all the Japanese games that do the same to the rest of the world
[1:21:25] <+BedHome> so that works fine
[1:21:32] <+silvery_cricket> Fun fact any joke about healthcare in the US has to be changed in foreign releases, because no other country has frame of reference for how bad the medical system is
[1:21:58] <DragoniusMaximus> id believe it, our healthcare sucks
[1:22:01] <+BedHome> answereing that could be a spoiler
[1:22:07] <+ConLin_Arts_> Kappa
[1:22:07] <Treasure_Vault> You want spoilers or no?
[1:22:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:22:13] <+BedHome> like either way thats a spoiler lmao
[1:22:23] <shiny_prinny> ultimate gamer berdly
[1:22:36] <%KELTHUZAD9999> a nightmare
[1:22:38] <Randomdoodbro> Yeah I think this might just have a "jerk" ending and not anything worse.
[1:22:42] <DragoniusMaximus> Berdly probably plays league of legends and PUBG competitively
[1:22:44] <Khotgor> If she had some kind of spine, she wouldn't be in such awkward situations Kappa
[1:22:52] <+BedHome> i think child me would have phyiscally attacked berdly by now honestly
[1:22:58] <17sevens> a fair bit left
[1:22:59] <peachy996> More
[1:22:59] <TheAntiNihilist> 50%
[1:23:07] <+dylin456> if you do the super boss your about 50%
[1:23:07] <FistTheWizard> 40%
[1:23:09] <Spagheddies> About hour and a half.
[1:23:16] <+BedHome> maybe like 40% to 60% depending on what you do and how you play
[1:23:23] <peachy996> Lots of af0xygMoar left
[1:23:29] <ArcanaArcade> The face on that box is literally :)
[1:23:31] <+BedHome> it took paige like 4 or more hours from this part, but some people can finish the game in 3 hours flat
[1:23:37] <Treasure_Vault> I dunno your spoiler policy, so I'll only say what happens if plague specifically asks for it
[1:23:39] <DragoniusMaximus> im half convinced toby named her Queen just so berdly could go "MY QUEEN"
[1:23:42] <shiny_prinny> i love Queen's dialogue sound effect
[1:23:42] <Refermaned> wtf is a gamer pie
[1:23:54] <Khotgor> If he wanted to make Gamer's Delight, it should have just been a massive monster can joke
[1:24:12] <TheAntiNihilist> Gamer stuff is connected to this being Cyber World episode
[1:24:37] <DragoniusMaximus> kris get the banana
[1:24:47] <%Murphio_GS> Queen is awesome yeah
[1:25:02] <+teriyaki_drinker> lytLEERY
[1:25:07] <+BedHome> its unclear
[1:25:10] <%Murphio_GS> Gamers
[1:25:17] <+BedHome> but based on one thing one of the robots said, the cars might BE people
[1:25:21] <DragoniusMaximus> its all Berdly clones
[1:25:33] <TheAntiNihilist> No.. it’s for dis
[1:25:38] <Khotgor> Hey look, it's David Lynch
[1:25:42] <peachy996> Hey it's the best guy
[1:25:42] <Randomdoodbro> Time for the BIG SHOT!
[1:25:42] <DragoniusMaximus> oh no its this guy
[1:25:43] <Mastahopo> THE MAN
[1:25:43] <Broand> HEY   EVERY   ITS HIM
[1:25:47] <vilecrois> hey chat do you want to be a [BIG SHOT]
[1:25:52] <DragoniusMaximus> its tumblr sex man
[1:25:52] <Coystick> It's PatLynchsAt
[1:25:54] <+silvery_cricket> HOW QUIRKY
[1:26:04] <+silvery_cricket> Im sure he will have a mountain of pornography
[1:26:05] <TheAntiNihilist> This WILL BE LONG
[1:26:15] <DragoniusMaximus> I legit dont understand why people wanna fuck him
[1:26:15] <%Murphio_GS> Time to be a [BIG SHOT]
[1:26:15] <peachy996> Think of him as Billy Mays
[1:26:16] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yes
[1:26:20] <+ThomasOfTroy> Because I agree
[1:26:21] <peachy996> It's ok to be wrong
[1:26:21] <shiny_prinny> that's fine
[1:26:21] <Khotgor> Most of Delta/Under is cringe
[1:26:22] <vilecrois> it's okay to have abd taste
[1:26:26] <JovianGargoyle> yup
[1:26:32] <copyritetm> If you tell me you hate spamton then yeah its not ok
[1:26:38] <Treasure_Vault> B I G   S H O T
[1:26:40] <peachy996> We're wrong everyday. Being wrong is fun
[1:26:42] <MugenSandan> Now's Plague's Chance to be a Big Shot!
[1:26:50] <Refermaned> you have rights to your own opinions
[1:26:51] <+blastyoboots> "NOW'S YOUR CHANCE TO BE A BIG SHOT! BE A BIG BE A BIG BE A BIG shot"
[1:26:53] <DragoniusMaximus> For some reason the characters in this chapter in particular compared to Undertale/chapter 1 of deltarune really ramped up the "woah so quirky uwu" characterization
[1:26:54] <+mrzimmer5> Plague is a real medium shot imo
[1:27:36] <ArcanaArcade> I think this is the only real bad song on the soundtrack. It's like a 1 min looped song.
[1:27:43] <Broand> Nows your chance to be a big shot!
[1:27:45] <TheAntiNihilist> Prepare to SUFFER
[1:27:52] <peachy996> Oh this one minute song rules
[1:28:06] <disgustingmage> Wanna be a big shot?
[1:28:07] <peachy996> and then there's that other one..
[1:28:25] <DragoniusMaximus> its fitting for the fight but id never listen to it on my own
[1:28:31] <reonome> SourPls
[1:28:44] <Khotgor> Why does this song give me some shitty version of "Don't Hug Me, I'm Scared"?
[1:29:16] <+BedHome> iirc you can actually press f1 for help here
[1:29:21] <disgustingmage> press F1 on your turn for a heal
[1:29:22] <+BedHome> on my laptop, f1 is bound to shut it down
[1:29:28] <+BedHome> so it was quite annoying
[1:29:45] <DragoniusMaximus> wtf is kromer
[1:29:55] <laserbeaming> If you Check him, it tells you to not give him money
[1:29:59] <cooldude69xx> The game did say not to give him money
[1:30:26] <+silvery_cricket> I dont know why but this feels racist?
[1:30:41] <DragoniusMaximus> racist to whom lmao
[1:30:43] <+silvery_cricket> Toby is actually stealing all your bitcoin
[1:30:44] <copyritetm> Its Spamtoms favourite year
[1:30:44] <darklion125> was that when vista camme out?
[1:30:46] <%Explodincatz> it was the prime age of the 90's kids
[1:31:03] <ArcanaArcade> @silvery_cricket what.
[1:31:20] <DragoniusMaximus> god i really hate this guy
[1:31:28] <Broand> Nobody knows about 1997, but it IS the date the first touhou game came out
[1:31:32] <disgustingmage> god i love this guy
[1:31:39] <DragoniusMaximus> fair enough lol
[1:31:51] <eyezhasplumberscrack> LUL
[1:32:02] <laserbeaming> there's one pretty girl by the end. Pretty much.
[1:32:05] <TheAntiNihilist> :(
[1:32:07] <+dylin456> only noellle suzzy and queen
[1:32:07] <disgustingmage> oh you'll get the pretty girl
[1:32:10] <Spagheddies> I know where one is.
[1:32:11] <DragoniusMaximus> oh but plague, do you not wanna draw tumblr sexy man?
[1:32:12] <+Magnet_Toa> you'll find her
[1:32:12] <copyritetm> Don't worry there is a pretty girl later
[1:32:12] <Smiss_Splattered> who needs pretty girls when you can be a [BIG SHOT]
[1:32:12] <Khotgor> You don't like Queenie? LUL LUL LUL
[1:32:13] <+silvery_cricket> No Plague you dont get them because Toby got pissed everyone drew porn of their characters
[1:32:14] <Waypastfuture> have patience plague, you will find her
[1:32:15] <majeser> there's only like one at the end LUL
[1:32:25] <+BedHome> id say two at least because queen counts imo
[1:32:30] <muetank> There is a REALLY good one later
[1:32:34] <%Explodincatz> theres a pretty girl later on
[1:32:45] <%maelyll> Noelle?
[1:32:52] <DragoniusMaximus> i think they're talking about tasque manager
[1:33:08] <+silvery_cricket> Deltarune Chapter 3 will have all characters be genderless sexless floating cubes
[1:33:12] <disgustingmage> noelle is a little to young
[1:33:16] <Smiss_Splattered> no there is some logic behind it
[1:33:17] <Coystick> Really sexy Queen art drawn out of spite would really teach Toby a lesson, just saying.
[1:33:19] <laserbeaming> Take Deal, Don't Give Money
[1:33:21] <+silvery_cricket> to escape pornography being drawn of Toby's characters
[1:33:22] <Refermaned> use check
[1:33:22] <Treasure_Vault> Do the CHECK first
[1:33:26] <+blastyoboots> if you check him he says "Take Deal, Don't Give Money"
[1:33:30] <GnollAUS> He don't care about money
[1:33:35] <DragoniusMaximus> what age are the main characters anyways?
[1:33:36] <DragoniusMaximus> high school?
[1:33:37] <GnollAUS> Just the DE4L
[1:34:09] <TheAntiNihilist> @dragoniusmaximus Yeah teenagers
[1:34:34] <+silvery_cricket> Can we get through this bossfight before he starts talking about NFTs?
[1:34:51] <disgustingmage> he gets wider
[1:35:00] <Treasure_Vault> It's weird to see people not CHECK. I checked first every time I saw a new enemy
[1:35:04] <TheAntiNihilist> I did this too
[1:35:05] <laserbeaming> game says no
[1:35:13] <+silvery_cricket> might have to Plague
[1:35:24] <DragoniusMaximus> idk if anything does happen but do it 100 times out of spite plague
[1:35:33] <%Murphio_GS> Maybe Toby hates you
[1:35:46] <Khotgor> Toby does hate you Plague; you drew too much Under-Porn Kappa
[1:36:04] <TheAntiNihilist> You can ignore him
[1:36:15] <laserbeaming> it gets worse
[1:36:16] <+blastyoboots> I mean that's your channel's motto
[1:36:21] <DragoniusMaximus> its okay plague, waifus are ahead, just plow forward
[1:36:34] <Ardailec> lack of bell means it was written over a year ago
[1:36:42] <GnollAUS> I love Sampton
[1:36:46] <GnollAUS> His so fun
[1:36:59] <disgustingmage> get the banana
[1:37:11] <TheAntiNihilist> Nope all pointless
[1:37:41] <+silvery_cricket> Pee on Noel?
[1:38:36] <Coystick> She sounds like a posh ohohohodere
[1:39:01] <laserbeaming> wao wao
[1:39:06] <%Murphio_GS> Rewowr
[1:39:36] <+RoosterSauces> Noelle got hops
[1:39:48] <Broand> the first letter is D
[1:40:00] <%Murphio_GS> Abudee abudie
[1:40:32] <laserbeaming> I don't think the town has a name
[1:40:40] <DragoniusMaximus> toby definitely focuses on characters rather then worldbuilding

[1:48:28] <%Murphio_GS> Don't stotes eat sheep?
[1:48:31] <+RoosterSauces> The best animals are murderous
[1:48:33] <Treasure_Vault> I hope Kris has a Schrodinger's penis, where it's only there half the time.

[1:51:28] <Refermaned> fried chicken
[1:51:35] <DuoMaxwell64> What kind of Bird is Berdly?
[1:51:42] <disgustingmage> Twitter
[1:51:50] <laserbeaming> Berdley is a Blue Jay, I think
[1:51:51] <%Explodincatz> man so many people hate birdly
[1:52:07] <catloafffing> i dont think anyone likes berdhgly
[1:52:15] <ArcanaArcade> I mean, he sucks arcana17LUL
[1:52:16] <+twohitgood> i took to calling him beardly
[1:52:16] <Treasure_Vault> Berdly is an anagram for ******
[1:52:20] <disgustingmage> i like burghlely?
[1:52:33] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah Berdley sucks
[1:52:47] <catloafffing> he sucks so bad
[1:53:23] <copyritetm> Berdley is a bro
[1:54:05] <DragoniusMaximus> berdly probably wears tshirts like "eat sleep game"
[1:54:15] <copyritetm> Do you like Susie Plague?
[1:54:23] <+RoosterSauces> I thought you were joking about the hat thing
[1:55:00] <+blastyoboots> Isopropyl Alcohol = rubbing alcohol
[1:55:04] <%Explodincatz> I tried to clean out my Jtrap recently but ABS pipes suck and it still leaks

[1:59:54] <%Murphio_GS> press up
[2:00:20] <%Murphio_GS> Gotta be fast here
[2:00:42] <tanarath> You're not running
[2:01:16] <laserbeaming> Ralsei is best cheerleader
[2:02:02] <Spagheddies> They won't, because it's DE, not because it's Warframe.
[2:02:14] <+blastyoboots> you can keep most of the charge if you use Zenurik instead of losing half
[2:02:16] <Spagheddies> Far be it from me to "dev-bash", though.
[2:02:30] <Coystick> rael human bean
[2:02:43] <DragoniusMaximus> shes literally blushing and staring at her ass hahahaha
[2:02:50] <tanarath> DE listens to its players sometimes.
[2:03:04] <tanarath> Which is nice, I guess.
[2:03:23] <Spagheddies> Very infrequently.
[2:03:33] <Futurecity10> You're kinda almost there?
[2:03:34] <DragoniusMaximus> about 66 to 75%
[2:03:36] <Futurecity10> like 65%
[2:03:37] <%Murphio_GS> a bit more than half way at this point
[2:03:39] <laserbeaming> You're a few hours away from the ending?
[2:03:39] <Refermaned> yes you are
[2:03:41] <tanarath> 80%?
[2:03:46] <Spagheddies> You just have the castle left, so, like, 30 to 45 minutes.
[2:03:50] <%Explodincatz> u still got another stream left
[2:03:59] <muetank> like 2/3 or 3/4 of the way through
[2:04:14] <DragoniusMaximus> I still have no idea what her head is
[2:04:16] <TheAntiNihilist> 25% left ish. Depends on the epilogue talking stuff
[2:04:20] <DragoniusMaximus> is it supposed to be a mouse?
[2:04:30] <+BlueLunecy> Coding is a job for masochists
[2:04:50] <%Murphio_GS> Please say no Noelle

[2:07:07] <disgustingmage> man what if my gaming chair is the toilet
[2:07:14] <%Murphio_GS> @Murphio_GS yes
[2:07:25] <Khotgor> @tanarath Pat would lose his fucking shit if he wore diapers
[2:07:26] <Coystick> THE LAFF
[2:07:36] <Spagheddies> E E Y U P
[2:07:49] <$Rezca> Its beautiful
[2:07:54] <laserbeaming> yes, it's the Windows XP background
[2:07:55] <%Murphio_GS> This is the worst thing about the internet
[2:07:57] <tanarath> Toilet gamer
[2:08:14] <tanarath> Pat is pure toilet
[2:08:14] <DrAntoineLove> @plagueofgripes any plans to play any souls games leading up to elden ring?
[2:08:34] <DragoniusMaximus> wheres the copious amount of futa porn this isnt accurate
[2:08:37] <%Murphio_GS> The horn is in every room I think
[2:09:10] <%silvery_cricket> What would the Queen do if Kris just started shitting on the floor
[2:09:48] <%silvery_cricket> reflect the lasers with the cd
[2:09:53] <TheAntiNihilist> Really? So easily forgotten
[2:09:59] <%silvery_cricket> GOD NO
[2:10:40] <+reiface08> which meme was this?
[2:10:43] <+blastyoboots> yeah the new meme
[2:10:47] <marcomatame> what's old is new again
[2:10:52] <ralphwiggum16> Hey Plague!
[2:10:52] <copyritetm> That was a reference?
[2:10:55] <%Artista_AF> wait it was a Meme?
[2:11:39] <marcomatame> didnt even know it was a reference tbh. i assumed it was meme-inspired, which, obviously, but a direct reference no
[2:12:13] <Spagheddies> A double-ended cucumber
[2:12:25] <vilecrois> I seen that video
[2:12:35] <+RoosterSauces> That cucumber is ribbed for flavor
[2:12:57] <vilecrois> BOOO
[2:13:07] <+BedHome> he is like, what, 10 years old?
[2:13:16] <+BedHome> maybe
[2:13:22] <+blastyoboots> several specific implications from it-- "how to use magic" humans can't use magic, "summer vacation when" Asriel comes home on summer vacation
[2:13:28] <ArcanaArcade> teenager
[2:13:28] <marcomatame> kris? he in highschool
[2:13:31] <laserbeaming> I think that might be a reference to the Piano Puzzle in Undertale
[2:13:40] <%silvery_cricket> What if Kris put the horn to his ass and just let off a fat fart
[2:13:42] <+BedHome> isnt he one class up from kindergarten with toriel
[2:13:43] <marcomatame> *they
[2:13:52] <+BedHome> their school has two classes
[2:13:55] <ralphwiggum16> No, we don't.
[2:13:58] <DragoniusMaximus> all the time plague
[2:13:59] <vilecrois> at the same time?
[2:14:07] <+RoosterSauces> Not intentionally
[2:14:12] <%Artista_AF> that's literally the whole Vuvuzella thing
[2:14:18] <copyritetm> I only scream when I finish
[2:14:21] <ArcanaArcade> @BedHome There are schools that go all the way through 12 years
[2:14:36] <%Murphio_GS> Poor peachboy
[2:14:42] <Refermaned> no
[2:15:21] <marcomatame> Berdly is a menace to humanity
[2:15:40] <%Murphio_GS> Which tracks because he's a bird
[2:15:48] <%Murphio_GS> birds are menaces to humanity
[2:15:56] <Treasure_Vault> Birds aren't even real
[2:16:24] <Treasure_Vault> It makes sense that he doesn't have nipples. Birds don't have nipples.
[2:16:34] <TheAntiNihilist> Birdly reminded me, when is the next Danganronpa stream?
[2:17:05] <Khotgor> Berdly wished he has nipples, since the thought of her mommy vomitting her milk from her throat after digesting the food seems less attractive than a big fluffy bosom LUL
[2:17:55] <+blastyoboots> it's story stuff about Kris by implication
[2:18:02] <+blastyoboots> he doesn't want to know
[2:18:41] <Mathochism> SHADOW PUZZZZZZZLESSSS

[2:20:54] <Refermaned> this one is a bit trickier
[2:21:30] <laserbeaming> this one took me a while
[2:21:40] <+BlueLunecy> These puzzles don't even open the way out you're solving them just to prove a point
[2:22:03] <%silvery_cricket> purple triangle in the top corner
[2:22:12] <Refermaned> @silvery_cricket shh
[2:22:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:22:25] <%Explodincatz> Eli...
[2:22:59] <laserbeaming> That solution was different than mine, but I guess it has multiple solutions
[2:23:02] <%silvery_cricket> This duck clearly wants to call you the N word
[2:23:06] <+logoth_> psaBig
[2:23:16] <%Murphio_GS> Berdley legit has a complex
[2:25:04] <DragoniusMaximus> yes they can overlap
[2:25:11] <DragoniusMaximus> thats how you solve it
[2:25:39] <Refermaned> stop giving help guys
[2:25:55] <%Explodincatz> its FatTwitter
[2:25:59] <+logoth_> Susie solved it
[2:26:46] <%silvery_cricket> That duck is gonna say it
[2:26:50] <%silvery_cricket> he is gonna say the n word
[2:26:52] <DragoniusMaximus> berdlys gonna call susie the gamer word
[2:27:14] <copyritetm> His crybaby backstory is nonsense don't worry
[2:27:16] <+logoth_> lol
[2:27:20] <DragoniusMaximus> LMAO plague
[2:27:22] <+logoth_> Thats exactly whats going to happen
[2:27:23] <DragoniusMaximus> I reacted the same way
[2:27:30] <%silvery_cricket> Yeah we already knew your entire backstory without having it read out to us
[2:27:52] <spyder_casual> What is this game?
[2:27:54] <+blastyoboots> she couldn't spell her sister's name? maybe because her sister was...????
[2:28:07] <+logoth_> You cant just have your characters ANNOUNCE how they feel! That makes me feel *ANGRY*
[2:28:09] <laserbeaming> unkown
[2:28:15] <Broand> We haven't seen anything about december until now
[2:28:21] <laserbeaming> unknown*
[2:28:28] <+blastyoboots> yeah it's really just Noelle backstory
[2:28:34] <DragoniusMaximus> what a highly relatable backstory lmao
[2:28:37] <%silvery_cricket> Wow he peaked in highschool
[2:28:56] <%Murphio_GS> Yes
[2:28:59] <%Murphio_GS> He is
[2:29:16] <%silvery_cricket> Oh he is a parasite
[2:29:24] <DragoniusMaximus> he reminds me of my old roommate
[2:29:24] <%silvery_cricket> hope we dont have to be forced to forgive him
[2:29:33] <laserbeaming> I think that's the intent
[2:29:45] <TheAntiNihilist> Birdly: Hello I'm unredeemable!
[2:29:48] <+logoth_> "can get much worse"
[2:30:02] <ArcanaArcade> The really weird part is he somehow gets worse and worse as the chapter goes
[2:30:20] <%silvery_cricket> Did he actually say the word "Im sorry"?
[2:30:28] <DragoniusMaximus> uh oh
[2:30:43] <DragoniusMaximus> he found his gamer grill
[2:30:48] <DragoniusMaximus> its done for
[2:30:56] <+BlueLunecy> Just make fun of him for not having the nipples he wants
[2:31:11] <copyritetm> I don't think he is ever meant to be likable
[2:31:12] <%silvery_cricket> This bird is gonna lie about this and say how he outsmarted everyone on four chan when he gets home
[2:31:16] <%Murphio_GS> Buff bird waiters are chad

[2:33:07] <+Frost_Quill> The suit guys  are supposed to be paint swatches I think.
[2:34:08] <+RoosterSauces> Everything he does is shitty
[2:34:24] <%Murphio_GS> CAFE
[2:34:31] <+twohitgood> (push him the other way)
[2:34:33] <cooldude69xx> They're called swatchlings
[2:34:34] <Spagheddies> @PlagueOfGripes About 30 to 45 minutes.
[2:34:38] <TheAntiNihilist> 20%
[2:34:38] <Refermaned> you're at the final part
[2:34:40] <laserbeaming> I doubt he's going back to the dark outfit
[2:34:48] <laserbeaming> Last Dungeon. But it takes a while
[2:34:56] <Eightgutter> 2 hours at least if you plan on doing optional boss
[2:34:56] <DragoniusMaximus> oh yeah this LMAO
[2:34:57] <Broand> This is the bottom of the part 3/3
[2:35:03] <+Frost_Quill> It's weak but it's a group heal.

[2:37:41] <warandpens> don't people still do that tho?
[2:37:42] <+mrzimmer5> roulx has some affinity for worms
[2:37:44] <DragoniusMaximus> I think doctors would perscribe meth for weight loss or something in the 50s/60s too
[2:37:51] <DragoniusMaximus> and market it towards women
[2:37:52] <cooldude69xx> Nothing hotter than w o r m s

[2:50:27] <+blastyoboots> @PlagueOfGripes look up some of the concept art of Tasque Manager she's a ten
[2:50:40] <%Murphio_GS> Domimatrix I guess
[2:50:44] <+blastyoboots> the pixel art doesn't do her justice
[2:51:08] <Spagheddies> That's true, but, consider: She has THIGHS.
[2:51:08] <+blastyoboots> the artist posted it on twitter
[2:51:14] <Refermaned> the person who came up with tasque manager's design posted the ref
[2:51:14] <Broand> the artist posted her character concept art, the artist is the same artist who did the designs of the musical trio btw
[2:51:15] <laserbeaming> this dungeon is kinda long
[2:51:26] <laserbeaming> You'll probably fall asleep before the end
[2:51:37] <ChrisPlaysThing> Fear the thicc
[2:52:11] <laserbeaming> To the right is the optional superboss thing, if you prefer to skip that
[2:52:14] <ChrisPlaysThing> Taste failure
[2:52:26] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah there's already a lot of art of her, as one can imagine
[2:52:36] <ralphwiggum16> 'Cuz he's a childish fuckwit!!!!
[2:52:41] <ChrisPlaysThing> No press
[2:53:53] <laserbeaming> I like the ChainMail description
[2:54:51] <laserbeaming> yes
[2:54:53] <%Murphio_GS> if you watch the hacker guy he changes at the point where it is
[2:55:04] <+blastyoboots> the hint is hacker guy
[2:55:17] <+blastyoboots> his head changed
[2:55:32] <Spagheddies> Ah, I saw it. Not a bad gag.
[2:55:34] <Krasis404> Right of the teacup
[2:55:53] <+blastyoboots> it's a hidden object game
[2:56:16] <%Murphio_GS> thank god queen's legs
[2:56:22] <laserbeaming> that thing you unlocked is for the optional superboss
[2:56:42] <Spagheddies> @PlagueOfGripes FYI, that way's the hidden Superboss, which you don't have a key to access, and would lengthen this chapter a fair bit.
[2:56:49] <laserbeaming> you probably don't want to fight the superboss
[2:57:28] <laserbeaming> susie wakes up and chooses violence
[2:58:58] <%Murphio_GS> Yes nubert is awesome
[2:59:03] <+BlueLunecy> Hell yeah Nubert
[2:59:10] <laserbeaming> Nubert rules
[2:59:11] <Broand> Nubert's fucking sick
[3:03:01] <Treasure_Vault> Haha, they're Servers
[3:04:24] <%silvery_cricket> OH GOD DAMMIT
[3:04:46] <%silvery_cricket> ITS SERGES' TRASH PUZZLE FROM POKEMON
[3:05:53] <$Rezca> Living next door to a neighbor's dog who does nothing but bark when they are away is annoying
[3:07:23] <laserbeaming> the final section can be quite lengthy
[3:10:51] <Spagheddies> Swatches.
[3:11:01] <laserbeaming> last dark world was cards. This one is computer stuff
[3:11:47] <Spagheddies> Knight, I'm guessing, is just a title.
[3:11:49] <%Murphio_GS> Knight was mentioned int he first game too
[3:12:43] <laserbeaming> *romantic swan boat ride time*
[3:14:14] <tanarath> huh, they turn blue
[3:14:32] <%KellBeII> ralsei is such a good boi
[3:14:46] <laserbeaming> you can probably finish it tomorrow? Or later? It's still like an hour or more until the finish line
[3:14:58] <%Murphio_GS> It is true, Ralsei is a good boi
[3:20:16] <%Murphio_GS> Now kiss the goat
[3:20:22] <laserbeaming> hold hands with the goat boi
[3:20:46] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague Cat, so cute.
[3:21:11] <+ToeBeanHeaven> B-Baka
[3:21:24] <%Murphio_GS> this one sucks not gonna lie
[3:21:42] <Spagheddies> Nah, he eascaped when you entered the world.
[3:21:46] <laserbeaming> he escaped your pocket when you entered the dark world
[3:22:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:22:22] <+ToeBeanHeaven> It's a LANDMASTER.
[3:22:44] <laserbeaming> it's from Chapter One
[3:24:20] <%Murphio_GS> he also starts doing more tho
[3:24:28] <laserbeaming> you generate TP when bullets graze you
[3:25:27] <%Murphio_GS> No
[3:25:28] <Spagheddies> You only take one house.
[3:25:58] <Treasure_Vault> You can block him off, too.
[3:26:33] <Spagheddies> You can close him in.
[3:26:40] <Spagheddies> Ah, yeah, you did it. Stream delay.
[3:26:44] <bepbopdrn> You can block his progress with a barrier, try to leave him with very little space, the game stops when one can-t advance anymore, but doesnt necessarily lose.
[3:26:47] <laserbeaming> he can capture diagonally
[3:27:20] <laserbeaming> it's still a guaranteed win for you. He can't claim more houses than you now
[3:27:26] <%Murphio_GS> so he can checkers
[3:28:51] <%Murphio_GS> it ended when he couldnt place more
[3:28:55] <laserbeaming> it ends when either player can't capture more houses itseems
[3:28:58] <Spagheddies> It ended because you occupied the last house he could occupy.
[3:29:00] <zhukis> it ended because he couldn't place more houses
[3:29:23] <ralphwiggum16> Goodnight Plague, I'll miss you.
[3:29:33] <laserbeaming> not a lot of swearing. Susie does most of it.
[3:29:33] <Spagheddies> I don't know, someone said "fuck" earlier.
[3:29:36] <ZComiX> deltarune has a bunch of cursing for some reason
[3:29:57] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Which is worse? Swearing or Murder? The whole thing has had copious amounts of MURDER.
[3:30:08] <laserbeaming> HUG
[3:30:13] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Say Fuzzy Pickles!
[3:31:17] <%Murphio_GS> id have my head turn to stone
[3:31:21] <laserbeaming> head first
[3:31:22] <Spagheddies> I mean, if your head turns to stone, you're virtually, actually dead.
[3:31:24] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Well, stone the brain, the body will just become tissue. stone the body and your agony will be insurmountable.
[3:31:31] <%Murphio_GS> at least then i'd be unconscious for whatever happenes
[3:32:40] <sosuke5> "the moon is beautiful tonight"
[3:33:10] <Spagheddies> A "content" creator? Or a content creator?
[3:33:24] <Spagheddies> Or a -content- creator?
[3:33:29] <laserbeaming> I like that she says "All the time" like she wants Susie to pick on her
[3:34:40] <Spagheddies> It ain't time for Susie to clap cheeks yet.
[3:35:13] <%kyh9> This is big gay
[3:35:18] <Waypastfuture> ah his act animation has him pointing with hearts
[3:35:22] <%Murphio_GS> The big gay
[3:35:23] <Spagheddies> 100% Homo
[3:35:28] <Samex_Comex> Makeout!
[3:35:33] <laserbeaming> Turbo Homo
[3:36:00] <Spagheddies> I guess the stream couldn't handle the gay.
[3:36:04] <Spagheddies> Or the wholesome.
[3:36:06] <zhukis> f?
[3:36:10] <laserbeaming> did the stream die?
[3:36:12] <laserbeaming> F
[3:36:13] <%Murphio_GS> Oh?
[3:36:16] <Spagheddies> Eeyup it did.
[3:36:29] <%Castle_Reverie> NotLikeThis
[3:36:38] <%Murphio_GS> there it is
[3:36:41] <Spagheddies> We back?
[3:36:41] <+ThomasOfTroy> bqck
[3:36:41] <laserbeaming> it's back!
[3:36:43] <JovianGargoyle> we back
[3:36:44] <%HawkGoggles2> was getting too hot an heavy for Twitch
[3:36:44] <Spagheddies> We're back.
[3:37:12] <Broand> Don't forget to save a second save file inside the castle so you can go back for optional content
[3:37:34] <+ToeBeanHeaven> We need to get Plague that Starlink Internet via satellites.
[3:37:58] <copyritetm> I don't think those people are actually nice
[3:38:08] <Spagheddies> It's the Nice Guy Paradox.
[3:38:09] <Mathochism> Welp, that explains hanging out with Pat, lol.
[3:38:44] <%Murphio_GS> I try to be as nice as possible, but I also try to be honest. I haven't really been in a situation that calls for me to lie to someone. Not that I haven't lied tho
[3:38:51] <%Murphio_GS> I was a shit kid that lied all the time
[3:39:02] <Tracazoid> It was probably made within 10 minutes of an artist seeing this scene
[3:39:26] <laserbeaming> She says the same thing no matter what you choose
[3:39:35] <%Johnmaddened> LUL
[3:40:08] <Spagheddies> I love this scene.
[3:40:16] <Spagheddies> It's sappy as hell, but I love it.
[3:40:16] <laserbeaming> it's a cute scene
[3:40:56] <Spagheddies> KEKW OF COURSE
[3:41:05] <Spagheddies> Cucked by Berdly.
[3:41:07] <Samex_Comex> Falco?
[3:41:28] <%Explodincatz> its the hero we deserve
[3:41:56] <%Murphio_GS> No he is
[3:41:58] <Spagheddies> OH YOU WAIT
[3:41:59] <sosuke5> wait for it...
[3:42:10] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Well, I for one hope it does come out sooner, I'm sad that the good commentary streams are always interrupted by shoddy net.
[3:42:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:42:39] <Spagheddies> THERE HE IS
[3:42:41] <%Murphio_GS> I also used to be like that as a kid too
[3:42:55] <%Murphio_GS> where i'd make up drama in my head and project it on others
[3:43:14] <Spagheddies> Berdly is such a chad he cucks Susie AND Noelle.
[3:43:34] <%silvery_cricket> KILL HIM NOELLE
[3:43:35] <%Explodincatz> RIP AND TEAR
[3:43:41] <%silvery_cricket> THROW HIM FROM THE HIGHEST TOWER
[3:43:48] <sosuke5> sorta, I thought he was a pretentious prick. He was probably an ok guy but I didn't much care for him
[3:43:57] <hattrick61> noelle chokes the chicken
[3:44:01] <laserbeaming> Two more Last Fights!
[3:44:07] <laserbeaming> 3 actuallyu
[3:44:28] <%Explodincatz> u should save the rest for another stream
[3:44:29] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Haha, how unfortunate for Ralsei, having his face crushed by Susie Ass. Hahahahahaha, what a terible thing to happen.
[3:44:35] <%Murphio_GS> Not much till the end now yeah
[3:45:03] <%Murphio_GS> Except I guess the big portion at the very end with no fights
[3:45:05] <%an4lpr0> plagueFace
[3:49:15] <laserbeaming> last 2 fights!
[3:49:49] <Samex_Comex> Oh no Falco!
[3:51:30] <%Murphio_GS> Cum chalice
[3:52:24] <%Murphio_GS> She stompy
[3:53:14] <laserbeaming> you can revive with regular healing
[3:53:24] <Spagheddies> @PlagueOfGripes You can use a healing item on dead party members. HP goes to the negatives for a reason.
[3:53:29] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah you can just heal him
[3:54:42] <%Murphio_GS> Ress items just do a lot of healing
[3:54:42] <laserbeaming> resurrection items heal them back up to 100% HP
[3:54:46] <Spagheddies> Resurrection items generally heal to full HP. Except for the dust for some reason.
[3:55:27] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes all healing (items or characters ressurrects)
[3:55:43] <Spagheddies> Dead characters also regain a % of their HP each turn.
[3:56:07] <tanarath> Dead characters heal a bit every turn.
[3:56:48] <%Murphio_GS> It's the wire thing from the original werewire
[3:57:39] <laserbeaming> you can go back to the bar and buy ButJuice
[3:58:12] <bepbopdrn> Collection
[3:58:17] <bepbopdrn> for now
[3:58:19] <%Murphio_GS> Yup completionist thing
[3:58:23] <+stoutfish> or you can just go to 1f
[3:58:25] <%Murphio_GS> It's right there
[3:58:30] <laserbeaming> There's the 3F thing
[3:59:35] <zhukis> oof, that's a lot of frames
[4:00:35] <%Murphio_GS> Ralsei is a wet towel
[4:02:43] <ape_tero> When I look at the queen I'm reminded of the movie "Coneheads"
[4:03:39] <bepbopdrn> Thanks to this chapter, I have her face burned on my retina and cant stop hearing MJ voice when there is complete silence.
[4:04:34] <+stoutfish> dual heal my dude
[4:04:47] <Spagheddies> Subsequent toasts increase the shield drain by 1.
[4:07:10] <%Johnmaddened> Plague cat looks so defeated
[4:07:17] <zhukis> hope the rule of 3 works and this is the last
[4:07:56] <laserbeaming> Undertale fights are usually endurance tests. But that's fine by me
[4:08:48] <apathetic_sociopath> you have the patience of a saint. I would have stopped playing this crap a long time ago. still entertaining though.
[4:08:56] <Spagheddies> Having a couple of ButJuices won't do you any harm.
[4:09:05] <laserbeaming> Just buy a lot of ButJuice
[4:11:15] <+stoutfish> Yes there is another fighter
[4:11:31] <+stoutfish> I think you should just take a break
[4:11:52] <%Explodincatz> u should really finish this next stream
[4:16:20] <%Murphio_GS> you can tell Toby really likes twitter
[4:17:19] <%Murphio_GS> Fair enough
[4:17:52] <sosuke5> The house taking mini-game was fun.
[4:18:35] <KitsuneManami> Heey its the meme game everyones playin
[4:18:38] <KitsuneManami> i hope its good
[4:19:08] <Spagheddies> Like I said earlier, subsequent toasts ncrease shield drain by 1.
[4:19:22] <+BigCoffee> group loosen should do it
[4:19:49] <Spagheddies> yeah that's kind of what this battle comes down to.
[4:19:57] <Shwepie> In endurance based combat that means you won.
[4:21:22] <%Murphio_GS> no
[4:21:24] <laserbeaming> I'm not sure
[4:21:26] <+BigCoffee> You're at the end game after this
[4:21:27] <laserbeaming> I think not
[4:21:41] <%Murphio_GS> oh wait, I thought there wasnt
[4:21:44] <%Murphio_GS> woops
[4:21:53] <tanarath> A 1-2 more sections left.
[4:21:58] <Spagheddies> Final battle. And I actually kinda like this one.
[4:22:00] <laserbeaming> You're right in one of those 3
[4:22:07] <bepbopdrn> Funny enough, apparently you can actually kill him
[4:22:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:22:16] <%Explodincatz> final boss has the best music I cant stop listening to it
[4:22:43] <bepbopdrn> But thats a different path
[4:23:28] <Spagheddies> Queen is good. I like Queen.
[4:23:47] <%Murphio_GS> It's sonic
[4:23:56] <Shwepie> All I see is Sonic.
[4:23:56] <zhukis> is that sonic
[4:24:35] <Spagheddies> No shields, don't you worry none.
[4:24:58] <+BigCoffee> megaman music
[4:25:11] <%Explodincatz> yeyeye its the music
[4:25:46] <Samex_Comex> Nyan
[4:26:06] <Spagheddies> It is a she.
[4:26:06] <laserbeaming> Tasque Manager
[4:26:09] <copyritetm> She is the Tasque Manager
[4:26:30] <Spagheddies> So remember Punchout?
[4:26:32] <laserbeaming> I hope you like Punch Out
[4:26:45] <%Explodincatz> SourPls SourPls
[4:26:47] <%Murphio_GS> Her robot got nice legs ngl
[4:26:50] <laserbeaming> you can only attack
[4:26:58] <sosuke5> You actually have to fight now
[4:27:03] <bepbopdrn> The hot polygon girl, all she needed was 1 fight to melt everyone, apparently.
[4:27:07] <laserbeaming> gotta attack
[4:27:12] <zhukis> punchout, huh
[4:27:14] <Spagheddies> EEYP
[4:27:20] <Shwepie> It's just Punch-Out?
[4:27:21] <Spagheddies> This is literally just Punchout.
[4:27:54] <laserbeaming> Violence is the answer in this one occasion
[4:28:21] <BappoTheMighty> this song slaps
[4:28:37] <%Explodincatz> god i love this song SourPls
[4:28:49] <Samex_Comex> You got this Little Mech
[4:29:24] <+stoutfish> you should attack
[4:29:45] <sosuke5> Doing better than Paige.
[4:29:52] <Spagheddies> Defending to build TP and using the combat phase to counter is honestly not a bad strategy.
[4:30:12] <%Murphio_GS> new move
[4:30:30] <Spagheddies> Like, if you can keep Laser Mode on, you get more out of defending and countering.
[4:30:33] <tanarath> Specials, @plagueofgripes don't go so hard. Press back for the wheels
[4:30:48] <+BigCoffee> you ca n just attack her
[4:32:07] <%Murphio_GS> PEW PEW PEW
[4:33:02] <laserbeaming> it's not a bad idea to defend though. You get more effective HP
[4:33:42] <Spagheddies> Yep, pretty much.
[4:33:47] <%Explodincatz> also notice her animation speeds up every round
[4:34:10] <tanarath> Punch the standing still ones or dodge?
[4:34:20] <+theRx_> How Waif Queen doin
[4:34:26] <zhukis> did queen teabag
[4:34:27] <tanarath> Dodge left or right to where there are gaps.
[4:34:32] <laserbeaming> I like that she teabags you when she wins
[4:34:49] <jillsandwichrpd> mommy gets punchy when she's had her juice
[4:34:51] <%Murphio_GS> Yes
[4:34:52] <Spagheddies> It does.
[4:34:58] <laserbeaming> it does count
[4:35:11] <Captain0Punz> yes normal attacking will make the battle faster
[4:35:13] <Spagheddies> All you have to do is deplete her HP.
[4:35:28] <tanarath> Yes! You can't mercy this fight.
[4:36:20] <+theRx_> Oh, I just realized that's a different had from what I had in this fight
[4:36:26] <+theRx_> S'neat
[4:37:10] <laserbeaming> I think the head depends on which one you choose in Chapter 1. This one is the defaut
[4:37:21] <%Explodincatz> I just realized she was Tbagging u
[4:37:29] <+BigCoffee> the head depends on chapter 1 yeah, Paige's head was a duck
[4:37:32] <flamingkm> plague looks like he's questioning his life
[4:37:33] <laserbeaming> yes, she does teabag you
[4:37:38] <+theRx_> Ahhh I see
[4:37:39] <%Murphio_GS> Man I wanna play punchout now
[4:37:42] <smallheals> dident peach do this without dieing ?
[4:37:59] <%Explodincatz> yup Peach never died at all
[4:38:01] <laserbeaming> maybe paige is just really good at punchout
[4:38:03] <%Murphio_GS> yeah but peach is randomly good at random things
[4:38:21] <%Explodincatz> Pat helped a lot as well
[4:38:43] <tanarath> Peach suffered horribly & had a massive backstock of healing items
[4:39:04] <laserbeaming> I like that the "mech" has little pawpads
[4:39:09] <zhukis> is this the end?
[4:39:15] <laserbeaming> it's kind of the end
[4:39:15] <+stoutfish> yeah you can just use a butjuice every turn, it's not too bad
[4:39:31] <Samex_Comex> Dancing like a fly, bite like a mosquito!
[4:40:32] <%Murphio_GS> Gotta dodge on time
[4:40:45] <Spagheddies> Faster attacks means you have to either be frame perfect, or have Laser Mode on.
[4:40:52] <+theRx_> I think half of my attacks in stage 3 were the ACT one lol
[4:41:01] <zhukis> Is there a difficulty select or something?
[4:41:03] <+stoutfish> it would be really funny if this took you 3 hours
[4:41:08] <tanarath> The last string is a combo string
[4:41:12] <%Murphio_GS> @zhukis nope
[4:41:15] <%SlightlySychotic> SlightlySychotic subscribed with Prime. 
[4:41:32] <+stoutfish> @zhukis it gets slightly easier each time you lose, you can unlock a round skip for 3
[4:41:49] <zhukis> Well, you are getting the hang of it Plague
[4:42:20] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:42:28] <tanarath> The 'ting' sounds tell you how many combos she'll do @plagueofgripes
[4:44:11] <zhukis> I assume it adds a few frames of dodge
[4:44:29] <Spagheddies> @zhukis And makes the dodges come faster.
[4:45:47] <tanarath> you're probably getting 60 frames per second, so 100,000,000,000 frames would make you invincible
[4:48:11] <+theRx_> Ayyyyyy
[4:48:20] <zhukis> looks like the end
[4:48:24] <laserbeaming> yay
[4:48:30] <%Murphio_GS> Pretty sure you got this over with
[4:48:31] <flamingkm> get fucked robo bitch
[4:48:33] <valiard> this looks like a fun final fight
[4:48:41] <%Explodincatz> gg
[4:48:56] <+theRx_> Reindumpy
[4:49:07] <Spagheddies> Well, there you go. You have your drawing, Plague.
[4:49:09] <+stoutfish> I had a ton of fun with it
[4:49:10] <flamingkm> that or she pooped herself
[4:49:18] <zhukis> That sonic face is a nightmare fuel
[4:49:24] <tanarath> She punched through the torsi
[4:49:30] <wolfen091> baby got back
[4:49:49] <DaoistNeko> yeah it looked pretty miserable
[4:50:39] <tanarath> Yes Plague, depression CAN be solved by not being depressed.
[4:51:47] <Spagheddies> THIS CREATURE
[4:52:55] <laserbeaming> he probably should have
[4:53:21] <%Explodincatz> gotta kill
[4:54:08] <Spagheddies> P sure this is the switch for the "Goatboy gonna betray us" bait laid at the start of the chapter.
[4:54:25] <zhukis> joining this in medias res, what the fuck is going on. Lol
[4:55:07] <flamingkm> does this game have a light-dark racism thing going on?
[4:55:10] <laserbeaming> she did explain it during the first bossfight
[4:55:24] <flamingkm> wow this game is dumb
[4:55:33] <BigBanterCorbin> you dont like the characters or the gameplay..... do you like the game? LUL
[4:56:34] <laserbeaming> she won't drop the dream bullshit
[4:56:34] <JovianGargoyle> Sorry your waifu hunt went so poorly. I had high hopes myself.
[4:56:42] <Spagheddies> Less dumb, more naïve, methinks.
[4:56:57] <+trashmanasam> did he become a big shot?
[4:57:02] <Spagheddies> No
[4:57:04] <Mathochism> Tasque Manager as close as you're getting, sadly.
[4:57:07] <sporeian94> Plague do you know about the alternative route to this chapter?
[4:57:13] <zhukis> does chris have a character at all?
[4:57:22] <laserbeaming> Deltarune Chapter 1 didn't have that many waifus either. Ralsei is a good boi though
[4:57:35] <tanarath> Not the whip lady?
[4:58:04] <%Explodincatz> yea Im not liking the chapter aspect
[4:58:12] <flamingkm> am I wrong or does plague like cartoon tomboy thicc and curvy women which can beat his ass and crush his head with their thighs
[4:58:29] <tanarath> He does
[4:58:49] <%Explodincatz> reminds me of the half life 2 episodes
[4:58:57] <tanarath> Or, at least, it's more interesting to him.
[4:59:01] <Mathochism> I don't think Toby's gameplay design carries over well into a longer-form game. Three to five hours for the whole narrative was sort of the sweet spot.
[4:59:07] <+theRx_> I feel like it's more going to be exploring different Lightners each chapter, or at leas the early ones?
[4:59:13] <%Murphio_GS> You can interact with them in a sec
[4:59:42] <zhukis> will you play more deltarunes after this?
[4:59:55] <zhukis> or is this the end of deltarune for  you
[5:00:06] <tanarath> You're not wrong about it being flat.
[5:00:21] <MortalSandWitch> I'm interested to see what the next update looks like. Apparently he's gonna put chapters 3-5 out at once, so that might allow for a more "cohesive" presentation
[5:01:13] <%Explodincatz> Toby did say not to expect these to be greater than Undertale
[5:01:35] <%Murphio_GS> Susie a dum dum
[5:01:42] <tanarath> Oh, she is.
[5:01:43] <zhukis> susie is kinda endearing
[5:02:37] <copyritetm> Honestly I was thinking that this chapter was a little weaker until I found out about the third route
[5:02:52] <GnollAUS> You can go and save the game by going back to school and jumping down.
[5:03:03] <+BioHunter> I should check out some books
[5:03:10] <+BioHunter> u*
[5:03:31] <Happysobek> hospital?
[5:04:19] <+theRx_> It Is A Mystery
[5:04:52] <flamingkm> So I'm guessing this is from the undertale people
[5:05:12] <flamingkm> it's chaos from warhammer
[5:05:24] <laserbeaming> he's talking about the Turtle guy from Undertale. Gerson
[5:05:30] <Samex_Comex> Gonna have a graveyard smash
[5:05:47] <Futurecity10> The hammer turtle from Understale, also a reference to tolkien
[5:05:49] <GnollAUS> The old turtle from Undertale.
[5:05:54] <GnollAUS> Who sells stuff
[5:06:05] <+theRx_> Older BroAsriel, yep
[5:06:07] <%Murphio_GS> Yeah Asriel is in college
[5:06:08] <Spagheddies> Asriel IS in college.
[5:06:10] <laserbeaming> Yes, Asriel is in college
[5:06:10] <Futurecity10> He's in college yes
[5:06:19] <Mathochism> Yessir, that;s why the college calendar was in Kris's prison room, too.
[5:06:19] <zhukis> yoshi
[5:06:41] <zhukis> he sacrificied yoshi for a higher jump, lol
[5:06:44] <tanarath> Super Mario
[5:07:09] <%Murphio_GS> Gay knights
[5:07:15] <Spagheddies> 100 homo
[5:08:36] <+theRx_> Tem
[5:09:14] <Broand> I feel like deltarune is kind of like the homestuck, to undertales' Problem sleuth
[5:09:25] <Samex_Comex> Was that bold and brash on the door?
[5:09:33] <GnollAUS> Can save in here tho
[5:10:01] <tanarath> Plague can
[5:10:39] <Broand> It became a bizarre loop of endless references
[5:10:40] <JovianGargoyle> damn right
[5:10:45] <zhukis> homestuck is a thing of internets past I don't understand and never interacted with
[5:10:48] <%Explodincatz> many things we like are sunk cost
[5:10:49] <+ScatterCatt> Nah, Plague, I went to conventions where Homestuck fans had panels and were fucking crazy for it.
[5:10:55] <tanarath> Undertale is better than this, but I still like it.
[5:11:12] <Shwepie> The best parts of Homestuck were the parts that avoided the main cast(s). Now it's just an abomination.
[5:11:12] <jacobknight13> God I just came in and I see plague is a purple farmer Kitty
[5:11:51] <Broand> A throwaway joke from Problem sleuth became a core and important plot point in Homestuck
[5:12:01] <+theRx_> Idk I bailed when the past Trolls were introduced as teens
[5:12:04] <Broand> Repeat that ad nauseum
[5:12:15] <+ScatterCatt> Homestuck: The Worst Isekai
[5:12:30] <Spagheddies> @ScatterCatt You forger SAO
[5:12:32] <Shwepie> It ended and then it unended and kept going.
[5:12:43] <tanarath> SAO was worse
[5:12:50] <+ScatterCatt> Nah, SAO is only slightly better than Homestuck. Barely better.
[5:13:14] <+theRx_> Blocked off because Undyne
[5:13:37] <Spagheddies> I don't think Homestuck had multiple, extremely pointless r <3 <3 e scenes, TBH.
[5:13:50] <+lordericter> its probably Toriel
[5:13:51] <%Murphio_GS> Toriel is one of the teachers
[5:14:01] <Spagheddies> But place, time, etc... so, I'll drop it.
[5:14:27] <+ScatterCatt> Nah, see I hate SAO. SAO is garbage. I have a passionate hate for SAO. Homestuck makes me feel nothing. Therefore, SAO accomplished more than Homestuck did.
[5:14:32] <%Explodincatz> "Blue Lives Matter" - Undyne
[5:14:32] <+ScatterCatt> And is therefore slightly better.
[5:14:39] <+theRx_> Yeah that sounds accurate
[5:14:45] <%HawkGoggles2> Hot AU Undertale fanficton for everybody
[5:14:50] <Broand> It's mostly stuff like the teenage drama which makes me think of homestuck
[5:15:07] <Broand> That and unreliable narration
[5:15:39] <ChortlesJ1> So what demon am I supposed to worship to so Muffet will finally appear in one of these chapters for just 2 seconds?
[5:16:02] <+theRx_> Gotta Blook out
[5:16:05] <Spagheddies> @ChortlesJ1 God that is such a fucking good question, I want to know this too
[5:16:10] <%Explodincatz> SourPls
[5:16:21] <+lordericter> thank you napsta
[5:16:59] <Samex_Comex> The nudity was drawn over in the manga at my school when I was a kid, the weird one was Goku's dick was just cut out the page
[5:17:28] <+theRx_> Gamer Dad yeee
[5:17:36] <Spagheddies> For whatever's worth, I like these two.
[5:17:52] <Spagheddies> Noelle and her dad? Real wholesome stuff. Gives me the happy chemicals.
[5:18:07] <%Murphio_GS> die instantly
[5:18:31] <Spagheddies> I mean, I have the feeling that it's going to happen eventually. Not sure when, but, I have a hunch.
[5:18:57] <tanarath> Maybe Noelle's mom is the mayor
[5:19:02] <Satokko> Is her mother the mayor by chance? Your neighbour and a 'she' stripThink
[5:20:18] <copyritetm> I think they talk about Kris like that cause they are supposed to be whatever gender you want
[5:20:21] <%HawkGoggles2> That's just Japanese sentence structure. This game is just trying to be "mysterious"
[5:20:27] <%Murphio_GS> adopted
[5:20:28] <Spagheddies> Not yet.
[5:20:33] <GnollAUS> Adopted
[5:20:34] <Spagheddies> Keyword being -yet-
[5:20:46] <+stoutfish> this chapter hints to it a lot
[5:20:54] <Broand> The thing is that Kris is supposed to know all of that stuff already so there's no explanation for the player
[5:21:00] <+theRx_> Yeah, there's a book in the library that hints at adoption, I think
[5:21:07] <+lordericter> yeah still weird that your dad is Asgore and not Frisk from what the game is putting down
[5:21:23] <Spagheddies> Like other people are saying, it's hinted, but there's not a clear response.
[5:21:34] <+stoutfish> you can just go home
[5:21:44] <%Explodincatz> I warned u man, to save it til next stream
[5:21:54] <Shwepie> This is the prequel-AU to Undertale where the humans were driven under ground and the human came up from underground.
[5:22:07] <Samex_Comex> It's him!
[5:22:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:22:15] <Spagheddies> JEBAITED
[5:22:16] <%Murphio_GS> Funny skull fan
[5:22:21] <+theRx_> I mean yeah he is???
[5:22:34] <Spagheddies> I do!
[5:22:36] <Samex_Comex> It's the Mii costume guy
[5:22:39] <Shwepie> It's Nass Deltarune!
[5:22:44] <bepbopdrn> literally
[5:22:46] <Spagheddies> Yes they are.
[5:22:48] <+theRx_> Yep
[5:22:49] <GnollAUS> Yes
[5:22:50] <%Explodincatz> its bad time AND bad husband
[5:22:51] <Futurecity10> Yes
[5:22:51] <+lordericter> ouch
[5:23:07] <thybattleborn> ooof
[5:23:12] <KnightOfTrousers> Is this near the end of the chapter?
[5:23:37] <zhukis> I expected "hard whisky"
[5:23:49] <KnightOfTrousers> Any favorite characters for this chapter, Plauge?
[5:23:51] <Shwepie> @KnightOfTrousers This is the end of chapter walk around and talk to everything part.
[5:23:51] <%Explodincatz> @KnightOfTrousers depends how much u want to skip
[5:24:06] <KnightOfTrousers> Goootcha
[5:24:07] <Spagheddies> @KnightOfTrousers Queen is the closest thing to that.
[5:24:11] <GnollAUS> I feel sad for Asgore
[5:24:16] <+lordericter> Kris your family is a mess
[5:24:22] <+theRx_> Realest dude
[5:25:06] <antthegoon> Sad dad energy
[5:25:40] <%Murphio_GS> yeah she very was
[5:25:43] <%Explodincatz> she was very very sad
[5:25:51] <coffeebearCafe> she cry
[5:26:05] <+DakotaMacDoodle> She may have cried
[5:26:13] <tanarath> She was incredibly angr-sad.
[5:26:17] <Spagheddies> Thick goth cat wyf
[5:28:50] <+lordericter> I can relate gingerbread man
[5:28:56] <theloganbrand> George from Seinfeld
[5:29:02] <zhukis> fried pickles?
[5:29:04] <%Murphio_GS> just eat the pickle out of the jar
[5:29:08] <Shwepie> You know Paige though, right?
[5:29:11] <+theRx_> You fry the WHOLE pickle? G'damn
[5:29:41] <tanarath> a good brined pickle is great
[5:29:49] <wolfen091> really?  I'm the opposite, its kind of weird when the whole spear is fried
[5:30:01] <Spagheddies> That guy was in the hospital last episode.
[5:30:11] <ChortlesJ1> That damned monster was hospitalized in Chapter 1 BTW
[5:30:29] <ChortlesJ1> LOSER
[5:30:42] <+lordericter> oh nooooo
[5:30:55] <Spagheddies> This guy's great.
[5:31:00] <Samex_Comex> Pizza girlfriend
[5:31:08] <johnakachoobie> bruh... she perfect
[5:31:57] <Broand> Fried pickles is a piece of american lore I don't know what to do with
[5:32:15] <tanarath> Talk to the other pizza next to the chef guy
[5:32:21] <%Murphio_GS> in chapter 1 alphys talks about a cat she sets the bowl of milk for
[5:32:44] <Spagheddies> She knows.
[5:32:53] <Spagheddies> This lady browses the internet.
[5:33:32] <JovianGargoyle> Best girl.
[5:34:26] <+theRx_> Yeah, that was her bother
[5:34:29] <%Explodincatz> gotta walk your sibling every day
[5:34:30] <+theRx_> *brother
[5:35:02] <%Murphio_GS> that's nice
[5:35:09] <+theRx_> Just chillin'
[5:35:18] <zhukis> brooding at the beach date
[5:35:20] <%HawkGoggles2> where's my lo-fi hip hop to study to?
[5:35:22] <+lordericter> the wind howls
[5:35:25] <madpuppy2424> I love Susie’ hair
[5:35:34] <Spagheddies> It is technically Autumn in the game, right?
[5:36:29] <+theRx_> MTT time yeee
[5:36:47] <Spagheddies> You might be.
[5:36:48] <Mathochism> Mettaton prolly.
[5:36:50] <%Explodincatz> always have been
[5:36:59] <copyritetm> It's Mettaton
[5:37:07] <%Artista_AF> Eli was Metaton all along
[5:38:32] <Spagheddies> Tasque Master
[5:38:36] <Spagheddies> Obviously.
[5:38:44] <Broand> Ah yes, Susie, Noelle and Berdly
[5:38:51] <Spagheddies> KEKW
[5:38:59] <%Murphio_GS> Where's Queen in this equation?
[5:39:10] <Spagheddies> You'll see.
[5:39:14] <baronouroboros> This is a sequel to Undertale, right?
[5:39:19] <%Murphio_GS> I think Susie is a hobo
[5:39:22] <Broand> These are all questions that we don't know
[5:39:24] <Spagheddies> @baronouroboros Unrelated.
[5:39:27] <baronouroboros> Ah
[5:39:33] <%Explodincatz> @baronouroboros no one knows not even Toby
[5:39:35] <+theRx_> I mean. She drinks the Alleyway Milk.
[5:39:40] <Broand> Like the amount of basic facts about the overworld that's been revealed so far is very low
[5:39:50] <madpuppy2424> So heartwarming to see Susie wide eyed here
[5:39:54] <+Havictos> @baronouroboros Just think of it as an alternate universe
[5:39:59] <baronouroboros> I know nothing about these games, but the art style's identical so I figured
[5:40:05] <baronouroboros> got it
[5:40:16] <Spagheddies> Fun fact: Undertale, Unrelated, and Deltarune are all anagrams of each other. And that's not a coincidence, maybe.
[5:40:23] <Samex_Comex> Give us pie!
[5:40:27] <%kyh9> All the students don't exist in Undertale
[5:40:35] <Broand> Except temmie
[5:41:02] <+lordericter> I hope Toby doesn't go full Anno
[5:41:05] <+Havictos> Toby is a good boy he would never throttle us
[5:41:10] <Broand> Theres a bunch of characters who don't exist in undertale
[5:41:15] <%Explodincatz> Toby would throttle us
[5:41:24] <%kyh9> Jerk it to Purple Dragon Girl abs
[5:41:25] <SonofStranger> you can call the phone
[5:41:57] <+Havictos> your bathroom maybe?
[5:41:59] <Spagheddies> Oh that is foreshadowing, isn't it?
[5:42:00] <%Murphio_GS> uh oh
[5:42:17] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:42:25] <%Explodincatz> Toby is already halfway to becoming a Yoko Taro
[5:42:27] <KgKid51> monkaS
[5:42:32] <zhukis> what
[5:42:36] <%HawkGoggles2> got to rip that out for a bit
[5:42:36] <+lordericter> ohh
[5:42:47] <%kyh9> Jumping out the window?
[5:42:56] <%Murphio_GS> I also lock away my heart when I take a shower
[5:43:08] <zhukis> what the hel
[5:43:16] <%HawkGoggles2> this boy is wasting water
[5:43:17] <+Havictos> don't like that no sir
[5:43:34] <%Artista_AF> wasting water like a true villain
[5:43:34] <+theRx_> Not concerning at all!
[5:43:50] <dakotachipmath> Delta Womb
[5:43:55] <Spagheddies> Are you under the sink? Or are you outside? Who are you, even?
[5:43:59] <baronouroboros> Is Kris dead?
[5:44:18] <%HawkGoggles2> He's gonna be when Toriel sees that water bill
[5:44:22] <bepbopdrn> Of all places, having a normal-size window on your bathroom
[5:44:25] <baronouroboros> I hope this build isn't a multi-story
[5:44:28] <baronouroboros> building
[5:44:30] <zhukis> this is endearring
[5:44:36] <zhukis> more than schmups
[5:44:45] <%kyh9> What the heck was he doing out there, the scamp
[5:44:47] <+LordSDB> Okay that line did make me laugh tho
[5:44:51] <zhukis> Is this euthemism for jacking off in the shower?
[5:44:52] <%Murphio_GS> They jerked off real fast
[5:44:57] <+theRx_> Mysterious Outside Activities
[5:44:57] <%kyh9> Motherfucker opened up another Dark Fountain
[5:44:58] <+lordericter> wonder if he killed someone
[5:45:00] <ChortlesJ1> Ehhhh, I'd think you'll only want to do this suspenseful stuff 2, maybe 3 times max in a chapter
[5:45:14] <+Havictos> Did they just murder someone?
[5:45:24] <Broand> ITS SYMBOLIC, YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN OF WHATEVER HE DID
[5:45:34] <%Murphio_GS> Get it, your hands are clean
[5:45:42] <Spagheddies> You'll see.
[5:46:02] <valiard> this is a prequel?
[5:46:05] <bepbopdrn> He just wants to play a little game with you
[5:46:07] <Mexrage> talking to people seem to imply he is the "creepy child" since he was very young
[5:46:13] <%KELTHUZAD9999> hard to say, the people in the town do say he is a weirdo
[5:46:18] <%Murphio_GS> @valiard no this is unrelated
[5:46:22] <bepbopdrn> or them* However you like
[5:46:34] <+Havictos> @valiard Think of it as an alternate universe
[5:46:35] <Shwepie> It's probably something that's been happening for a while. Chapter 1 presented Kris as a troubled child, at least since Asriel left.
[5:46:41] <%HawkGoggles2> All of us? ...okay
[5:46:49] <theloganbrand> Her ex got sent to the couch a lot, didn't it?
[5:47:11] <SonofStranger> confirmation that susie has had a sleepover before
[5:47:18] <%kyh9> Very innocent sleepover with girl
[5:47:32] <Broand> I think the fact that the players perspective follows the heart, rather than follows Kris is significant
[5:47:40] <%Murphio_GS> well Toriel is also gonna be there, so I assume
[5:47:44] <+Havictos> Hell Busters is GREAT name
[5:47:48] <%kyh9> Dog?
[5:47:50] <zhukis> this is better than everything else in the game, lol
[5:47:50] <SonofStranger> it has a tail
[5:48:04] <Shwepie> Is Plague going to draw a movie posted for "Invasion of the Cat Petters"?
[5:48:05] <Spagheddies> It looks like a human, but it appears to have a tail, so I'm not sure.
[5:48:19] <%Murphio_GS> yup
[5:48:24] <bepbopdrn> A monkey
[5:48:25] <%kyh9> I don't think Susie has put it together yet
[5:48:29] <+theRx_> Yeah, don;t think she knows that
[5:48:34] <%kyh9> That all these people in Dark World are basically just objects
[5:48:37] <Mexrage> i doubt susie understand the mechanics around it
[5:48:37] <%Murphio_GS> Susie is dense as fuck
[5:48:54] <%kyh9> What do they call it?  Shared Delusion?
[5:48:57] <+theRx_> I mean Lancer is still in your inventory rn
[5:49:03] <bepbopdrn> She is barney, you have to teach her
[5:49:14] <SonofStranger> it's interesting that susie's good traits are completely accidental
[5:49:27] <Samex_Comex> Bacon pancakes
[5:49:32] <%kyh9> I kinda liked the Old susie portraits more
[5:49:43] <SonofStranger> @PlagueOfGripes if you check your pocket the cards should still be there
[5:50:01] <%kyh9> YOU
[5:50:03] <%Murphio_GS> Ralsei is a good boy
[5:50:13] <Spagheddies> I shut up for this one.
[5:50:13] <BigBanterCorbin> "..."
[5:50:13] <%kyh9> SUSIE IS THE THE GIRL
[5:50:15] <Mexrage> no best choice, sorry
[5:50:17] <%stotans> SUSIE
[5:50:18] <ChortlesJ1> Edgy ... boi
[5:50:18] <%Explodincatz> goat
[5:50:19] <%KELTHUZAD9999> you
[5:50:19] <JovianGargoyle> You
[5:50:20] <bepbopdrn> Eating worms while petrified
[5:50:22] <Mathochism> ralsei
[5:50:23] <MortalSandWitch> the goat
[5:50:23] <Shwepie> I bet this decision has a hook for something later.
[5:50:26] <+theRx_> Just polycule it
[5:50:27] <Meister_dukakis> ...
[5:50:32] <madpuppy2424> Def Susie
[5:50:34] <zhukis> you?
[5:50:42] <%kyh9> SUSIE BROS
[5:50:56] <%kyh9> WE HAVE TO DO IT FOR HER, SUSIE BROS
[5:51:00] <Broand> Even stuff like what day of the week it is in game is obscured
[5:51:12] <Mexrage> as an ace person, why no "..."?
[5:51:20] <+Havictos> music's sounds a bit warped seems concerning
[5:51:28] <Spagheddies> Hey I went Noelle. Just because I couldn't go "..." but still.
[5:51:31] <Broand> the game is purposefully hiding surface level information to throw you off
[5:51:33] <Captain0Punz> Noelle is reserved for Susie
[5:51:38] <SonofStranger> the people who vote ralsei want noelle to go with susie
[5:51:39] <Shwepie> @Mexrage Cause you can go as friends.
[5:51:49] <+Havictos> Gives me a forshadowing feeling
[5:51:49] <vonmaultke> no "..." option FeelsBadMan
[5:51:54] <Samex_Comex> No L, No L, Santa's name has no L
[5:52:01] <+theRx_> WOOO KAIJU
[5:52:12] <%kyh9> tags: giantess
[5:52:13] <Mexrage> wouldn't ultraman count as giant human?
[5:52:14] <+Havictos> Those actually exist
[5:52:21] <copyritetm> Giant Human movie is just attack on titan
[5:52:23] <vonmaultke> I want a refund!!! roar!
[5:52:25] <%Explodincatz> Japan has those movies
[5:52:27] <+theRx_> Attack of the 50-Foot Woman?

[5:53:24] <+theRx_> MonkaW
[5:53:25] <+Walopoh> @Havictos Suzie's dinosaur snores
[5:53:56] <%Murphio_GS> This last part is the most fucked up thing
[5:53:57] <+yoshkosh20> neck break gang
[5:54:12] <+Havictos> 😨 😨
[5:54:15] <zhukis> so what's happening here?
[5:54:21] <bepbopdrn> asgore is gonna take the shot, I'm sure
[5:54:23] <%HawkGoggles2> that's where my heart is
[5:54:30] <%kyh9> OH
[5:54:33] <%kyh9> He opened the door
[5:54:34] <+theRx_> @kyh9 NOW he's opened another Dark Fountain
[5:54:37] <+Walopoh> revCursed
[5:54:40] <+yoshkosh20> WICKED
[5:54:49] <ChortlesJ1> God that's so cool
[5:54:58] <%kyh9> @theRx_ Opened a fountain but with an open door so there's nothing to keep it constrained
[5:55:00] <Mexrage> why leave the door open, though
[5:55:11] <Spagheddies> Guess who's back?
[5:55:12] <+Walopoh> :)
[5:55:12] <%kyh9> Are we gonna see flower on the tV?
[5:55:16] <copyritetm> @Mexrage So Undyne can be in the next chapter too
[5:55:17] <bepbopdrn> so others can enter
[5:55:18] <%kyh9> POTASSIUM
[5:55:23] <zhukis> oh flowey smile
[5:55:28] <tanarath> To let the smoke out @mexrage
[5:55:33] <%kyh9> Flowey maybe?
[5:55:35] <+InternetShis> Jevil 2!
[5:55:39] <KityLinn> lol
[5:55:40] <Spagheddies> Ghaster.
[5:55:44] <%Murphio_GS> WD Gaster
[5:55:50] <%kyh9> Didn't look like Gaster to me tho
[5:56:00] <tanarath> Flowey.
[5:56:06] <sporeian94> PRobably next boss of chapter 3, likely they are gonna do a TV world in vien of this internet world
[5:56:14] <+Walopoh> The noises were part of the Ghaster stuff in Undertale IIRC
[5:56:14] <Spagheddies> I mean, WD Gaster is Rouxls Kaard, no?
[5:56:15] <%kyh9> You get it from the super-boss
[5:56:16] <ZipperMan56> That smile belongs to Spamton
[5:56:17] <Mexrage> obviously, it is yoko taro's emil mask smile
[5:56:18] <%Explodincatz> Gaster dont have teeth
[5:56:18] <copyritetm> Its apparently the same smile as sans, or almost the same
[5:56:26] <%kyh9> The Super Bosses allude to the Gaster stuff
[5:56:26] <vonmaultke> this choppy song isn't the best
[5:56:31] <+Havictos> Gaster exists outside of time and space so he could be involved somehow maybe
[5:56:39] <sporeian94> Well see you in 2 years
[5:56:40] <ZipperMan56> People data mined the game and found that out
[5:56:44] <%kyh9> Yeah, I think the Chapter structure is weird for this
[5:56:44] <Broand> 7 chapters
[5:56:45] <$around_40_jobbers> in the "weird" run of this chapter it's more paced out, funny enough
[5:56:47] <+Walopoh> I am lol
[5:57:07] <KityLinn> zero of the waifus
[5:57:09] <+stoutfish> You don't like Tasque Master?
[5:57:13] <%Explodincatz> Underlife 2 Episode 2
[5:57:14] <Spagheddies> I still insist on the Tasque Manager.
[5:57:14] <%KellBeII> no waifu for lifu
[5:57:15] <Refermaned> only like 2 new ones
[5:57:17] <zhukis> is susie a waifu?
[5:57:18] <bepbopdrn> maybe he is worried that there is little action sometimes
[5:57:19] <%kyh9> Queen, Task Manager?
[5:57:20] <SonofStranger> when you look for a waifu but they end up with each other
[5:57:27] <tanarath> Yeah, I enjoyed the game more, but you aren't wrong Plague.
[5:57:32] <SonofStranger> spamton
[5:57:36] <+yoshkosh20> Can't go wrong with susie
[5:57:37] <tanarath> You found the Goth Cat.
[5:57:44] <Spagheddies> The goth cat!
[5:57:53] <Broand> Don't believe anything you see on TV!
[5:57:53] <%Explodincatz> draw Goth mom yea
[5:57:55] <Samex_Comex> The crazy cat with milk
[5:58:01] <%kyh9> I wonder what you and Paige and PAt will think of a Noelle playthrough?
[5:58:06] <%kyh9> Azumanga Daioh reference?
[5:58:12] <Refermaned> I don't think anyone has
[5:58:15] <ChortlesJ1> I honestly don't think anyone has
[5:58:32] <bepbopdrn> Secret boss, eventually?
[5:58:37] <ChortlesJ1> Plenty of 'art' of Tasgue Master though
[5:58:53] <tanarath> Secret boss never for Plague.
[5:58:57] <+LordSDB> PLAGUE RAID!
[5:59:09] <+yoshkosh20> ironmouseRAID ironmouseRAID ironmouseRAID ironmouseRAID ironmouseRAID ironmouseRAID
[5:59:09] <+theRx_> Spreading the Plague
[5:59:15] <vonmaultke> SeemsGood thanks for the stream boss
[5:59:15] <bepbopdrn> Yeah, makes sense, he did say he is in for the narrative.
[5:59:16] <muetank> psaGib LuvHearts
[5:59:16] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Thanks for the Stream!
[5:59:18] <%Explodincatz> we can vomit on his hoes

[5:59:32] <+theRx_> G'night!
[5:59:32] <ChortlesJ1> I am ready for whatever ending Toby nightmares into exitance
[5:59:38] <tanarath> Night, Plague.
[5:59:42] <%Murphio_GS> See ya later, Eli
[5:59:49] <%KELTHUZAD9999> good luck

[5:59:57] <tanarath> The ads also absorb good content.
