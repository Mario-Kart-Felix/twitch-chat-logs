[0:03:01] <Ralfclogs> The “Uhhh actually” ghosts
[0:03:17] <CaptHat211> Hello, strangers!
[0:03:28] <@dcn2049> Looked like there was an obtuse amount of Wendy fanart for a bit there. OBS has preferences
[0:03:56] <+silvery_cricket> What do you like the most about the remake, and what do you dislike the most?
[0:04:19] <Deadbulky> Nomuraaaaaaaaaa
[0:04:24] <TheWe4pon> Time for more bad game?
[0:04:55] <@dcn2049> What's your opinion on god, the universe, and everything?
[0:04:57] <+cursedwithadhd> Leon's face is the best, makes me laugh every time I see it
[0:04:59] <+silvery_cricket> That is just the sum total of all human interaction.
[0:05:23] <SuperSmashIke> I want a Resident Evil 4 remake, I would love to play that game with not garbage controls
[0:05:37] <Deadbulky> It was just enouth
[0:05:40] <cap_bon> Oh is it time for interesting character moments to be interrupted by nomura waving his dick around
[0:05:52] <+justianxix> just the right amount of spice
[0:06:13] <Ralfclogs> Are you going to go on CastleSuperBeast to slam on ff7R?
[0:06:21] <notanegg8> hi folks! thanks for streaming, i've been enjoying these
[0:06:44] <CaptHat211> I had a friend on Twitter tell me about the changes in FF7R. I publicly apologized to George Lucas for criticizing him for the changes in the special editions.
[0:06:56] <SuperSmashIke> What the hell are channel points, I haven't used Twitch in forever
[0:07:12] <@dcn2049> Woolie fears guests
[0:07:13] <+silvery_cricket> Close the window to keep the wifi in
[0:07:17] <Sergoflight> @SuperSmashIke you get points for watching
[0:07:22] <@dcn2049> Good bye forever, Plague
[0:07:24] <Ralfclogs> That’s fair
[0:07:25] <CaptHat211> See you in a bit.
[0:07:28] <+cursedwithadhd> lets hope
[0:07:28] <SuperSmashIke> @Sergoflight Thank you
[0:07:34] <TheWe4pon> PANIC!
[0:07:36] <@dcn2049> haha
[0:07:37] <Ralfclogs> Bai Plague
[0:07:38] <cap_bon> channel points are an amazing idea twtich had that allows people to steal emotes for some reason
