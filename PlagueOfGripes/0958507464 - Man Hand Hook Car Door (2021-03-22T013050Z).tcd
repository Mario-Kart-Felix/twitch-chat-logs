[0:02:30] <EdictEngine> Whack
[0:02:33] <bettysharkface> The burden of success
[0:02:45] <+rawringkhris> danganronpa is stupid trash but its my favorite trash garbage
[0:02:52] <KineticZen> Boss Hogg's Internet Shack no more
[0:03:03] <$vehementvadr> the internet is all we have this year to be fair
[0:03:04] <+MarshallLee67> good nom nom nomming!

[0:03:38] <ScreamLord> the Eldrich Farmer returns!
[0:03:43] <bettysharkface> Nasty dipe baby
[0:03:56] <+MarshallLee67> monomi's diaper is awful but it's funny in the context of monokuma doing it to bully her
[0:03:59] <marshallventure> we will help u plague
[0:04:12] <marshallventure> remember their names that is, not with the trial
[0:04:25] <layZman> v3 essentially

[0:04:43] <+MoistBananaPudd> sugoiPino2
[0:05:00] <bettysharkface> Kendo
[0:05:06] <Fluffy_Tamamo> What the sweet hell is that in the corner, and tell me you actually wore it. ewicaZoom

[0:05:26] <KineticZen> Best girl maxed
[0:05:33] <B1ak3N1k05999> You filled out best girl
[0:05:34] <+MoistBananaPudd> I love the characters of V2 so much
[0:05:40] <layZman> I'd pay any amount of money to see plague do a danganronpa style execution animation
[0:05:46] <+MarshallLee67> Boss Baby Fuyuhiko
[0:06:18] <ralphwiggum16> OMG Plague
[0:06:29] <ralphwiggum16> I wished you still looked like a kitty.
[0:07:07] <blackskulldragon18> Ok guys let not spoil the fun for Plague
[0:07:11] <+gupa5240> Hello Plague. Have you made any headway on the Vtuber rig or did you scrap the idea altogether?
[0:07:35] <bettysharkface> So fucking convoluted
[0:07:40] <bettysharkface> So stupid
[0:08:04] <+MarshallLee67> that sure is a theory let's see how this goes!
[0:08:08] <Zebroneath> Given it's Danganronpa, it's nothing is far fetched
[0:08:26] <ralphwiggum16> Plague = cutest kitty, don't @ me
[0:08:26] <+MarshallLee67> nagito's so slimy
[0:08:29] <kentrix11> I love how no matter what everyone has strong emotions for Nagito.
[0:08:43] <B1ak3N1k05999> Nagito is a mixbag
[0:08:45] <jertagadlafrata> Hand Door Hook Door Car tho
[0:08:50] <Solokaldaka> ferretSURPRISE
[0:08:51] <blackskulldragon18> it would make sense because we see peko wet when Hajime and Soda saw her.

[0:15:47] <+MarshallLee67> "I SEE"
[0:15:56] <blackskulldragon18> PowerUpL OSFrog PowerUpR

[0:16:11] <B1ak3N1k05999> See
[0:16:13] <twieetcha> Hey plague how’s this game compared to the last one?
[0:16:29] <B1ak3N1k05999> All of the main male characters sucks in Danganronpa
[0:16:46] <+MarshallLee67> hiyoko's funny specifically because of how awful she is yeah
[0:16:49] <bettysharkface> Smelly goblin child
[0:16:59] <CalderGaming> I despise her which I assume is working as intended
[0:17:03] <B1ak3N1k05999> Adopt her?
[0:17:12] <Solokaldaka> SMOrc all bark no bite
[0:17:12] <+lemonsakee> I like that shes mean

[0:17:59] <+lemonsakee> nagitos voice in english always throws me off
[0:18:04] <BlueLunecy> Ibuki is good in moderation
[0:18:13] <bettysharkface> She has 2000s syndromes
[0:18:16] <blackskulldragon18> PowerUpL chewyKEK PowerUpL
[0:18:18] <B1ak3N1k05999> Ibuki is good

[0:18:27] <Johnmaddened> Ibuki is alright
[0:18:32] <+MarshallLee67> i didn't get the "c you next tuesday" joke until watching someone stream it and i blacked out
[0:18:34] <+pheblorganzardo> "I like x, but i wouldn't want to hang out with them" - plague about everyone he likes in danganrompa
[0:18:34] <+lemonsakee> Monokuma!
[0:18:42] <+ninja_galt> gungeon grandpas
[0:18:54] <+pheblorganzardo> dungle rumbo

[0:19:17] <+SkookumHime> skooku2Coffee
[0:19:19] <layZman> i'm surprised it worked past censors but it probably went something different in japanese
[0:19:21] <+MarshallLee67> i call fuyuhiko "boss baby"
[0:19:25] <B1ak3N1k05999> @vladtet909 No Ramsey

[0:20:13] <@PeachSaliva> Fuck u Eli
[0:20:14] <+SkookumHime> sbfpSetIn
[0:20:16] <Arancet> streamers throwing around subs to each other just feels like a bezos donation
[0:20:19] <sosuke5> Eat your hamburgers, Apollo
[0:20:20] <@PeachSaliva> I do what I want
[0:20:26] <+xiccy> I still don't know which Paul is which
[0:20:40] <@PeachSaliva> @arancet it’s called supporting your friends, it’s pretty fun
[0:20:41] <KaiserMario> Plague complaining about generosity is really on-brand
[0:20:45] <bettysharkface> The nasty dipe rabbit let him out
[0:20:56] <+boriss96> i beat the game and i forgot almost everything
[0:21:16] <Solokaldaka> @PlagueOfGripes how happy where you when Byakuya got killed?
[0:21:23] <+SkookumHime> Akane has some huge bazonkers
[0:21:28] <ChrisM341> Mauri
[0:21:34] <KaiserMario> Honey boo-boo
[0:21:35] <+MarshallLee67> honey boo-boo? something stupid like that?
[0:21:36] <+ninja_galt> probably one of those teens on jerry springer
[0:21:44] <+lemonsakee> it was a jerry springer girl
[0:21:44] <@PeachSaliva> bitch i might be
[0:21:46] <slix3431> Akane is wonderful. She has spirit.
[0:21:51] <+MarshallLee67> yeah honey boo-boo
[0:21:53] <sosuke5> Sgetti and butter
[0:21:55] <+lemonsakee> honey booboo
[0:21:55] <@PeachSaliva> it’s my hot body, i do what I want
[0:22:07] <+SkookumHime> you tell em
[0:22:07] <ehStuGatz> fun fact: honey boo boo's mom's bf  was a rampant pedophile
[0:22:09] <@PeachSaliva> No no that’s honey boo boo
[0:22:15] <KaiserMario> Then Token created a show for Cartman called "Fatty doo-doo"
[0:22:17] <+Jumpie8> same Plague
[0:22:28] <vladtet909> I'll never forget that that show was on The Learning Channel
[0:22:29] <+JailShmixRemix> I SEE
[0:22:30] <impulse255dj> damn it I was happy forgetting happy booboo was a thing.
[0:22:33] <+MarshallLee67> I SEE
[0:22:43] <Johnmaddened> naruhodo
[0:23:11] <Arancet> @PeachSaliva and thats fine, i'm genuinely glad, not singling you out, just observing that subs going back and forth keeps giving amazon more cuts of the same cash
[0:23:13] <KaiserMario> But they cancelled the Honey Boo boo vs Fatty doo doo fight thanks to James Cameron raising the bar
[0:23:14] <@PeachSaliva> eli where is your purple cat
[0:23:29] <B1ak3N1k05999> Cause she’s bored
[0:23:37] <+NlghtSprites> gtiJim gtiHand Howdy.
[0:23:44] <+ninja_galt> Elon Musk Starlink
[0:23:50] <@PeachSaliva> No I probably shouldnt be watching this lol
[0:23:50] <+ninja_galt> satellite internets
[0:23:54] <+JailShmixRemix> Kuzuryu PogChamp
[0:23:55] <+SkookumHime> I can't wait for Eli to be full Vtuber
[0:24:04] <SirFancySwank> the real question is how much peach will actually remember if she does play it
[0:24:10] <+JailShmixRemix> 0
[0:24:21] <lemoan> "It's just a fucking game!"
[0:24:22] <MightyPsychoBat> I was just wacthing your dark souls playthru, i almost forgot you have a twicth account
[0:24:29] <+MarshallLee67> paige will somehow manage to remember everything she sees here
[0:25:12] <+MarshallLee67> this is like the only case where the names are kinda confusing so thankfully it's not a problem after this
[0:25:23] <+JailShmixRemix> D:
[0:25:24] <+ninja_galt> Paige Pat and Plague should do a Valheim stream
[0:25:34] <+JailShmixRemix> D: dont call him baby face
[0:25:35] <kingra> Literally boss baby
[0:25:43] <bettysharkface> Hamming it up
[0:25:45] <sosuke5> he LOVES it!
[0:25:53] <+MarshallLee67> bryce is so good as nagito
[0:25:55] <vladtet909> Bryce Papenbrook
[0:26:00] <JohnClaggart> is it not the same va as the main character from 1?
[0:26:01] <Johnmaddened> he's great
[0:26:03] <BlueLunecy> A voice you can just punch in the throat
[0:26:04] <B1ak3N1k05999> Bryce boyyyy
[0:26:05] <+MisterRockett> Oh thank god you're playing it in English.
[0:26:13] <KaiserMario> Man, I really dislike the art in these games...
[0:26:15] <%SkookumHime> SkookumHime subscribed with Prime. 
[0:26:17] <+traximus_s> dude bro
[0:26:43] <+JailShmixRemix> @JohnClaggart Pretty sure it is yes
[0:26:45] <+lemonsakee> I like some of the english voices but i never liked nagito
[0:26:59] <%SkookumHime> senpai noticed me
[0:27:00] <+JailShmixRemix> Because he's a chunni
[0:27:01] <slix3431> GUN HAM
[0:27:03] <BlueLunecy> It suits him though
[0:27:05] <layZman> because he's anime
[0:27:05] <+MarshallLee67> gundham's a good boy
[0:27:06] <lemoan> @kaisermario Really? That's what of the better things about this game.
[0:27:10] <JoshManVGH> N8n
[0:27:13] <+MisterRockett> I think it's literally meant to be a Gundamn reference
[0:27:15] <+lemonsakee> Tanaka is great
[0:27:20] <+JailShmixRemix> D:
[0:27:21] <JoshManVGH> ninja rather
[0:27:23] <BigBanterCorbin> ?
[0:27:28] <+JailShmixRemix> shes saying shit
[0:27:37] <+MarshallLee67> "ibuki's crazy, moving on"
[0:27:41] <layZman> just ibuki things
[0:27:42] <+ninja_galt> Gundam Wang
[0:27:44] <+MarshallLee67> either a pun or an old reference
[0:27:45] <Johnmaddened> adhd strikes again
[0:27:58] <KaiserMario> @lemoan Yeah, I hate how every piece of clothing has thousands of random folds and the anatomy is really bad
[0:28:37] <dk_scrub> truly some amazing voice acting from bunny-chan
[0:28:47] <+ninja_galt> is he having a siezure?
[0:28:52] <+ninja_galt> or fapping?
[0:28:56] <slix3431> Junko?
[0:28:59] <+lemonsakee> peko peko
[0:29:00] <+MarshallLee67> usami --> monomi, yeah
[0:29:03] <+JailShmixRemix> ye
[0:29:15] <lemoan> @kaisermario really? I mean the anatomy is generic anime. But the thicker outline style is pretty nice.
[0:29:16] <chidory000> is this the first case?
[0:29:18] <layZman> the english voices on some of these characters are hit or miss
[0:29:28] <TheGuesty> a whole minute+ to decide
[0:29:31] <layZman> luckily her jp va isn't that much better
[0:29:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:29:44] <AlonZombi> hi plague, hi chat HeyGuys
[0:29:53] <+JailShmixRemix> Hi Alon HeyGuys
[0:29:55] <+russianlaunchcodes> hm yes the E girl deserved it then
[0:30:07] <+lemonsakee> Monokuma's JP voice being doraemon was really amazing, its too bad she had to retire before 3
[0:30:17] <layZman> their replacement was pretty solid
[0:30:21] <+lemonsakee> yea she was good
[0:30:27] <+MisterRockett> I think this trail is like, the trail I remember the least of the entire goddamn series.
[0:30:29] <+JailShmixRemix> He looks like a bird
[0:30:37] <+Jumpie8> I was think that
[0:30:41] <$SGrim> I say toilet brush, but sure
[0:30:41] <+Promessa_EX> nagito is shinji
[0:30:42] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[0:30:43] <BlueLunecy> Very bristly looking. In a good way I think
[0:30:51] <TropiusHunter> wait where is makoto?
[0:30:54] <+ninja_galt> there is a hedgehog hugging his head
[0:30:55] <bettysharkface> Hahahaha
[0:31:00] <+lliniumen> @misterrockett  that's surprising to read
[0:31:03] <xeros720> i agree, it's too rough to be a paint brush
[0:31:07] <TropiusHunter> lmaoooo
[0:31:07] <+JailShmixRemix> @TropiusHunter different game
[0:31:09] <xeros720> maybe clean a grill?
[0:31:24] <+JailShmixRemix> Diagrams PogChamp
[0:31:26] <KaiserMario> @lemoan Thicker outline is pretty simple, nothing really special about that, but the overall thing gives off an impression of someone who can't really do volume in 2D and so over does the details
[0:31:28] <$Rshiners> was that fat byakuya
[0:31:29] <+Promessa_EX> best girl made a map
[0:31:33] <BlueLunecy> The ever reliable Chiaki
[0:31:37] <+MisterRockett> @lliniumen I literally forgot who the culprit in this case killed until I played V3 last year. I forgot she had died.
[0:31:53] <+lemonsakee> tfw no gamer girl gf
[0:31:53] <TropiusHunter> never played dn2, only dn1
[0:32:01] <jowi_time> plague of gripes?! streaming!?!?! It has been an AGE!!
[0:32:01] <layZman> v3 was a trip and a half
[0:32:09] <filialpails> locked room mystery!
[0:32:17] <+IceBreak08> Have you played Digimon Story Cyber sleuth? I just remembered that game because they have the same music composer from Danganropa
[0:32:20] <+lemonsakee> every single act 3 of these games sucks
[0:32:34] <Johnmaddened> thanks Chiaki
[0:32:34] <TropiusHunter> celeste was fun
[0:32:39] <xeros720> did the original wolfenstein not have automap?
[0:32:40] <+JailShmixRemix> D:

[0:35:19] <$Rshiners> volume is good

[0:35:22] <Zebroneath> volume is fine
[0:35:23] <bettysharkface> Volume is fine
[0:35:25] <Arancet> is fine
[0:35:25] <+Promessa_EX> i never finished v3 and yeah
[0:35:30] <Johnmaddened> Volume's good
[0:35:56] <+MisterRockett> @Promessa_EX I did, it literally makes no sense for these characters to look alike and apparently have the same special talent????
[0:35:57] <TropiusHunter> oohh maybe the killerr is hifumi
[0:35:58] <arkv01> gotta wear the swimsuit while doing murders
[0:36:09] <KaiserMario> @lemoan Can't really argue your tastes, it's just I think the characters look terrible, kinda like something you'd see from some cheap "how to draw anime" magazine from the 90s
[0:36:14] <xeros720> just remembered this part now
[0:36:20] <+Promessa_EX> @MisterRockett huh aw man

[0:37:11] <layZman> haha the chef's X is a knife and fork
[0:37:16] <layZman> subtle
[0:37:16] <+JailShmixRemix> @Jinrya_Geki the not crazy looking one
[0:37:43] <+Promessa_EX> The loud one is always right
[0:37:51] <cap_bon> Remember that locked room muder? it was me Barry!
[0:37:53] <+Promessa_EX> danganronpa pro tip
[0:37:54] <Jinrya_Geki> they all look crazy with the ahegao dead eyes
[0:38:19] <TropiusHunter> @cap_bon dang it he broke the speed force again
[0:38:26] <+traximus_s> @cap_bon  he he
[0:38:30] <%Void_The_Dark> @PlagueOfGripes how are you liking this game's first chapters compared the first game?
[0:38:34] <vladtet909> It begins
[0:38:34] <KgKid51> LUL
[0:38:35] <Darkred28> I can't believe my eyes
[0:38:35] <sosuke5> gameplay!
[0:38:41] <cap_bon> I used the speed force to vibrate through the wall and kill her
[0:38:43] <kingra> Here we go
[0:38:45] <+JailShmixRemix> Unironically love this song
[0:38:47] <BlueLunecy> We didn't sign up for gameplay in this video game
[0:39:12] <saw6boy> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[0:39:25] <vladtet909> Scrum debate is hands down the best Dangan Ronpa song
[0:39:33] <@Nightbot> @MarshallLee67 -> Oops, I did it again! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:39:44] <xeros720> so, "go through the entrance hall", the "other 4 girls," and "sound of window" shattering
[0:39:45] <TropiusHunter> HER NOSE LMAOOO
[0:39:51] <+JailShmixRemix> Scrum debate is amazing
[0:39:53] <+MarshallLee67> mrfeel1Monokumafloss
[0:39:58] <+lemonsakee> noses go large when you act proud in japan
[0:40:02] <bettysharkface> The broken vase! She went in the window next door instead?
[0:40:07] <+Promessa_EX> Has anyone ver made a really good mix of all the versions of this song?
[0:40:21] <+Promessa_EX> i'm always afraid to google danganronpa

[0:40:23] <SeValentine> marthSad everytime someone plays this game, is just sad to see
[0:40:28] <+lemonsakee> I love the one in VT
[0:40:31] <+lemonsakee> V3
[0:40:32] <+Taglog7> KomodoHype dungeon grandpa
[0:40:33] <Jinrya_Geki> is that an auditorium?
[0:40:44] <+lemonsakee> Dont look up anything about the game it will spoil you
[0:40:48] <+MarshallLee67> it's a music room @Jinrya_Geki
[0:40:50] <+ninja_galt> I would never play this game lol
[0:40:54] <Darkred28> Pretty much
[0:40:57] <SeValentine> this is pretty much like phoenix wright so ... true leftiAyaya
[0:40:58] <+lemonsakee> when v3 came out I had to avoid youtube for a while
[0:41:04] <Dlent_> The secret passage is behind the curtain! KomodoHype
[0:41:13] <+Promessa_EX> i've somehow done very well, V3 is the only thing i haven't finished
[0:41:13] <Darkred28> SeValentine Not really, Phoenix Wright has a good story
[0:41:13] <vladtet909> Googling Dangan Ronpa at all is like asking to be spoiled
[0:41:17] <+JailShmixRemix> ITS THE MEAT ON THE BONE PogChamp
[0:41:25] <Jinrya_Geki> shattered to make it seem like they either came in or out
[0:41:28] <layZman> phoenix is good up until apollo justice
[0:41:28] <TropiusHunter> never played 2 but dont care about spoilerinos
[0:41:37] <layZman> then it gets too goofy for its own good imo
[0:41:42] <+Promessa_EX> one time i knew that a charcter was alive, didn't end up being a big deal though. huge spoil potential
[0:41:57] <SeValentine> I mean in matter only of evidence and stuff. this is weeb storyline & giggles
[0:41:59] <+Promessa_EX> it was a thumbnail too
[0:42:11] <Johnmaddened> I remember this segment giving me a lot of trouble
[0:42:22] <Darkred28> Who has Plague waifud?
[0:42:23] <+MarshallLee67> "Crap!"
[0:42:28] <+MarshallLee67> @Darkred28 he maxed out akane already
[0:42:49] <Darkred28> Akane, huh?
[0:43:01] <+JailShmixRemix> Tsumugi best girl
[0:43:01] <TropiusHunter> are we at the beginning of this case or close to the end?
[0:43:03] <Darkred28> Figured he'd be a Chiaki guy
[0:43:11] <+MarshallLee67> @TropiusHunter this is the first non-stop debate
[0:43:14] <+JailShmixRemix> @TropiusHunter more or less the beginning
[0:43:14] <+Promessa_EX> what's on the map
[0:43:25] <TropiusHunter> ok cool thx guys
[0:43:58] <+cyborgkiwigent> cyborgkiwigent subscribed with Prime. 
[0:44:20] <sylphyyyy> omfg plague what led you to play this
[0:44:28] <+Promessa_EX> ah i wish i could figure it out for the first time but i think i remember this one
[0:44:29] <+JailShmixRemix> Waifus
[0:44:45] <JohnClaggart> wasnt there something else from that game this morning?
[0:44:58] <JohnClaggart> in the secret scenarios
[0:45:07] <420mangojuice> 5am rare plague stream FeelsGoodMan
[0:45:07] <bettysharkface> The vase?
[0:45:14] <StrawberryLion> Am I having a stroke?
[0:45:28] <+JailShmixRemix> if u can type coherently, probably not
[0:45:28] <TropiusHunter> ding dong bing bong
[0:45:44] <+MisterRockett> Doesn't iiiiit?
[0:45:44] <Darkred28> Damn
[0:45:47] <Johnmaddened> NotLikeThis
[0:45:53] <Darkred28> Plague's a fucking genius
[0:45:55] <layZman> danganronpa's logic is more circular than a mobious strip
[0:45:55] <xeros720> phoenix wright does the same thing a lot, poke a single hole to get somewhere
[0:45:56] <+JailShmixRemix> NO THATS WRONG
[0:45:56] <BlueLunecy> It's all about loose threads for these games. Keep pulling til something appears
[0:45:58] <+MarshallLee67> NO THAT'S WRONG mrfeel1Monokumafloss
[0:46:04] <+Promessa_EX> Sore ha chigauyo!
[0:46:07] <SeValentine> Objection leftiGrowl
[0:46:09] <LunarRemix> I suppose is a way to continue conversation?
[0:46:13] <TropiusHunter> wow hinata already seems less annoying than makoto
[0:46:26] <$Rezca> Vazz
[0:46:37] <%SkookumHime> smarty
[0:46:38] <+shaidot> V3 is still the best in the series
[0:46:47] <+MarshallLee67> @TropiusHunter yeah makoto is easily the worst protag of all the DR games
[0:46:53] <+JailShmixRemix> Easily
[0:46:55] <+lemonsakee> Hinata is just a more abrasive but insecure Naegi
[0:46:55] <+Mickerus> Ibuki was mistaking "vase" for "bass"
[0:47:01] <StrawberryLion> Only a complete rascal would break a vase
[0:47:11] <cerazor01> Hinata is worse
[0:47:21] <+EyeFarted> Is vazz male or female?
[0:47:23] <B1ak3N1k05999> 2 is where Danganronpa peaked. Well that and it’s spin off.
[0:47:27] <BigBanterCorbin> @Mickerus i never got that joke thank you
[0:47:27] <LunarRemix> A red herring
[0:47:40] <JohnClaggart> is Vâse male or female?
[0:47:41] <+Promessa_EX> ... tabun
[0:47:43] <xeros720> and Nagito is such a smug fuck that he already knew
[0:47:52] <+lemonsakee> you really think ultra despair girls is where it peaked
[0:48:18] <TropiusHunter> its just trying to present simple evidence in an exciting way
[0:48:21] <+ArchimerCXV> lots of characters overthinking with underthinking characters
[0:48:24] <xeros720> at least in this one you get the feeling Nagito is doing it on purpose
[0:48:30] <Darkred28> Electricity
[0:48:32] <bettysharkface> It bugs me
[0:48:32] <+MarshallLee67> i always saw it as electricity yeah
[0:48:32] <@DCN2049> it's terrible whatever it is
[0:48:32] <Eger007> yes
[0:48:32] <TropiusHunter> haki
[0:48:34] <glass_marcus> I beleive so
[0:48:34] <BlueLunecy> Spirit energy I bet
[0:48:36] <LunarRemix> Mainly spiritual energy
[0:48:38] <+JailShmixRemix> Haki
[0:48:40] <+EyeFarted> long gray hairs
[0:48:42] <%SkookumHime> its sheer will
[0:48:42] <+Promessa_EX> he is very powerful
[0:48:43] <+shaidot> Nagito is this game's Kyoko: He already figured out the trial he just wants the protagonist to do it
[0:48:43] <sosuke5> very long, blue eyebrow hairs
[0:48:44] <Zebroneath> pure energy
[0:48:45] <+lemonsakee> its manliness
[0:48:48] <SeValentine> electronic whiskers leftiKEKW
[0:48:52] <StrawberryLion> That's his spiritual pressure.
[0:48:53] <JoshManVGH> pipe cleaners
[0:49:11] <%SkookumHime> he has pink eye in the wrong color
[0:49:41] <+reiface08> can you spell the word knife?
[0:49:44] <+Solid_Stro> sabert14Sip
[0:49:44] <Johnmaddened> show your work
[0:49:47] <vladtet909> Thank you Nekomaru
[0:49:48] <BlueLunecy> It's fun how pissy he gets when people don't play along with his forced murder games
[0:49:51] <bettysharkface> Wh...
[0:49:52] <+lemonsakee> I like to shit too
[0:49:55] <SeValentine> game needs plot marthRage
[0:49:55] <TropiusHunter> patrick seitz?
[0:49:55] <LunarRemix> Who doesn't?
[0:49:58] <JoshManVGH> see pipe cleaners
[0:49:58] <+Solid_Stro> Me too buddy
[0:50:00] <layZman> 100% right
[0:50:01] <+MarshallLee67> that's correct
[0:50:02] <+ArchimerCXV> Nekomaru 'i'm gonna shit' Nidai
[0:50:05] <%SkookumHime> that bear is..... the worse
[0:50:05] <B1ak3N1k05999> Monakuma is a pissant
[0:50:06] <sosuke5> "What did the killer have for breakfast?!"
[0:50:07] <+lemonsakee> he's right
[0:50:08] <+JailShmixRemix> atleast 45%
[0:50:18] <+Promessa_EX> is that pat?
[0:50:20] <Johnmaddened> Ultimate Shitter
[0:50:27] <B1ak3N1k05999> @promessa_ex Yes
[0:50:36] <impulse255dj> sbfpSetIn
[0:50:47] <HelghastTroop> why is eli talking like scooby doo?
[0:50:51] <+Solid_Stro> Eh, imagine his execution based on his dialogue Nekomaru. shotoEww
[0:50:54] <+lemonsakee> yeah they do cute shit with the x's now
[0:50:58] <HajimeNoStream> roobiroo
[0:51:00] <$Rshiners> is that fat byakuya
[0:51:02] <+ninja_galt> this game does some crazy stuff with sprites
[0:51:03] <+MarshallLee67> yeah 2 and V3 have unique drawings on some of the dead pictures, it's neat
[0:51:06] <Darkred28> MEAT ON THE BONE
[0:51:13] <+lemonsakee> ON THE MEAT BONE
[0:51:13] <+JailShmixRemix> ON THE MEAT BONE
[0:51:13] <+ArchimerCXV> really is a back-to-back 'you've proved i was there, can you prove i WASN'T there?'
[0:51:15] <+reiface08> that minigame sucks
[0:51:19] <+Promessa_EX> fat byakuya is such a good character
[0:51:25] <Johnmaddened> THE MEAT ON BONE
[0:51:27] <sylphyyyy> LUL you'll be seeing more of it
[0:51:28] <+JailShmixRemix> MEAT ON THE BONE
[0:51:33] <%SkookumHime> sbfpSetIn
[0:51:39] <+lemonsakee> MEAT BONE ON THE
[0:51:48] <+JailShmixRemix> THE BONE ON MEAT
[0:52:02] <Johnmaddened> oh boy this one
[0:52:02] <HajimeNoStream> thats too big to be ashit
[0:52:04] <Darkred28> LUL
[0:52:05] <+MarshallLee67> good taste
[0:52:09] <TropiusHunter> wow gundham is actually amazing
[0:52:17] <+lemonsakee> gundham is the best character
[0:52:25] <HelghastTroop> gravel in a sock
[0:52:32] <HelghastTroop> perfect murder weapon
[0:52:33] <Darkred28> Sonia is best girl
[0:52:42] <TheWarpedPixel> May I also counter with just: Ibuki.
[0:52:44] <HajimeNoStream> Sock in a cock
[0:52:48] <+lemonsakee> sonia is a slut, its great
[0:52:54] <+JailShmixRemix> Tsumugi is the best
[0:52:56] <Darkred28> Sonia is just horny
[0:52:57] <+JailShmixRemix> how dare you
[0:52:59] <+lemonsakee> oh i just remembered what the murder weapon was hahaha
[0:53:30] <bettysharkface> Watch it be the fucking fish or something
[0:53:36] <bettysharkface> The fish is missing
[0:53:41] <TropiusHunter> sleeping with the fishes
[0:53:44] <BigBanterCorbin> frame goblin PepeHands
[0:53:46] <+JailShmixRemix> There were goldfish in the tank
[0:53:51] <+JailShmixRemix> they ate her D:
[0:53:51] <kylecoolperson> the backround music slaps!
[0:53:57] <+lemonsakee> hold
[0:54:06] <CalderGaming> oh THIS fucking trial
[0:54:09] <Johnmaddened> this one feels like such a leap in logic
[0:54:11] <Darkred28> This part is a pain in the ass
[0:54:25] <cerazor01> this game is stupid
[0:54:25] <xeros720> yeah, i recall this one being really awkward
[0:54:29] <Dlent_> This one was the worst in the game for me
[0:54:30] <%SkookumHime> 10 gal tank with water is legit about 100lbs
[0:54:32] <+MarshallLee67> this is the part that trips a lot of people up
[0:54:33] <+lemonsakee> it pains me that i know the answer
[0:54:35] <+JailShmixRemix> ye this one is a stretch
[0:54:37] <TheWarpedPixel> I am remembering now why I love watching someone play this and not replaying it.
[0:54:53] <BigBanterCorbin> this one's hard
[0:55:05] <Darkred28> Good point
[0:55:13] <ehStuGatz> the trash can or the bat?
[0:55:22] <TropiusHunter> YOOO
[0:55:26] <%SkookumHime> the bat did
[0:55:26] <TropiusHunter> PLZ BE TRUU
[0:55:27] <mellorolo> hello
[0:55:30] <HajimeNoStream> bounced head off piano
[0:55:36] <+lemonsakee> how did i even figure this out
[0:55:38] <Darkred28> Oooh boy
[0:55:44] <Jinrya_Geki> bashed head off piano?
[0:55:47] <%SkookumHime> the fish tank is a distraction
[0:55:48] <+smtpyrojack> Oh man, the fish tank description just clicked
[0:55:50] <+MarshallLee67> just look through all the bullets you have and think real hard
[0:55:52] <glass_marcus> I remember being stuck on this for a while, and then watching a friend be stuck on this for a while. basically, this section has been seared into my brain.
[0:55:58] <xeros720> feel lucky i got spoiled on this one singular part before i played
[0:56:12] <TropiusHunter> you got this plague, i believe in you
[0:56:26] <LunarRemix> That's what I'm thinking
[0:56:29] <%SkookumHime> it was part of the fight
[0:56:30] <LunarRemix> She was pushed into the fish tank
[0:56:34] <+lemonsakee> oh god
[0:56:38] <Run44forrest> Has plague played dangan ronpa 1 on stream?
[0:56:42] <+Promessa_EX> just gravel and water scattered
[0:56:47] <+JailShmixRemix> I dont believe so
[0:57:08] <HelghastTroop> trash can, it was frank reynolds that did it
[0:57:16] <%SkookumHime> skooku2POG
[0:57:37] <+Promessa_EX> i think they are asking you to have the answer already
[0:57:38] <TropiusHunter> OOHHH
[0:57:46] <TropiusHunter> i think ive got it
[0:57:52] <+smtpyrojack> I think I figured it out, can't wait to see Plague's reaction if I'm right
[0:57:55] <+lemonsakee> I know it but I cant saaaaay
[0:57:57] <Johnmaddened> watching this while knowing the solution already is rough
[0:58:08] <ehStuGatz> honestly piano might work as a weapon
[0:58:11] <%criticalinked> criticalinked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 22 month streak! How goes
[0:58:14] <sosuke5> i do, too
[0:58:24] <HajimeNoStream> I thought you already picked that one
[0:58:29] <+JailShmixRemix> Dumb logic PogChamp
[0:58:33] <+Promessa_EX> it's a good idea, but you would need some way to hold it together
[0:58:34] <Darkred28> hehehe
[0:58:41] <Eightgutter> this is the hardest nonstop debate in the game imo
[0:58:45] <+lemonsakee> how did i even figure this out its so dumb
[0:58:46] <sosuke5> you typically don't use the same bullet twice
[0:58:47] <SilverRoddo> A gym sock full of gravel 🤔
[0:58:49] <+xerioes> oh this game looks infuriating
[0:58:53] <Johnmaddened> gravel on the bone
[0:58:56] <+JailShmixRemix> not really
[0:59:05] <bettysharkface> Maybe...she got her head smashing into the window?
[0:59:18] <Dlent_> Force fed gravel until dead. Messed up.
[0:59:18] <+JailShmixRemix> most of the none stop debates are pretty simpl;e
[0:59:27] <xeros720> well, in both cases, i think there'd be blood
[0:59:30] <%SkookumHime> skooku2Sleep good night Plague! good luck!!
[0:59:30] <cerazor01> SeemsGood
[0:59:37] <ehStuGatz> killer killed the victim by crushing her head with the piano door then broke the fishtank to wash way the blood
[0:59:37] <+MarshallLee67> if you haven't figured this out by the time you get here this is probably the hardest question in the game
[0:59:46] <HajimeNoStream> idasu
[0:59:58] <+ninja_galt> fisted
[1:00:12] <raveous> Ibuki LUL
[1:00:13] <+Promessa_EX> I'm getting triggered by Ibuki's voice, that's was Carol in vesperia
[1:00:26] <kingra> Ibuki...
[1:00:26] <GreaterPantsu> I remember being stuck on this for like 30-45 mins
[1:00:35] <@PeachSaliva> She died from a bad dye job
[1:00:40] <LunarRemix> If the fishtank was used to kill her wouldn't the body be wet?
[1:00:47] <+MarshallLee67> you REALLY need to make a leap in logic to figure this out- the game does not lead you on here
[1:00:48] <+Promessa_EX> It's pepto bismal
[1:00:50] <Johnmaddened> you're kinda right
[1:00:52] <BigBanterCorbin> youre gonna be upset with the answer probably LUL
[1:00:54] <SirFancySwank> do you want the answer
[1:01:00] <Sapphire_Breeze> now I feel like a big weirdo for figuring this one really fast LUL
[1:01:02] <HajimeNoStream> upset stomach, diahrea
[1:01:07] <StrawberryLion> Wash the blood from the gravel?
[1:01:09] <+Promessa_EX> there's another
[1:01:16] <+lemonsakee> why did i figure this out im such a loser
[1:01:18] <@PeachSaliva> did she diahrrea to death?
[1:01:20] <kingra> How bullshit is the answer?
[1:01:21] <HajimeNoStream> Just call the beanie stupid again
[1:01:32] <+shaidot> oh i just remembered what it was
[1:01:39] <+JailShmixRemix> LOL
[1:01:45] <+Promessa_EX> @kingra it actually kind of makes sense
[1:01:46] <josh3sain> have you ever watched full metal jacket?
[1:01:58] <+JailShmixRemix> Dysentery is a serious issue
[1:02:07] <HajimeNoStream> The big guy was
[1:02:08] <SilverRoddo> Maybe she was wrestling and bladed too deep?
[1:02:10] <sosuke5> not so much bullshit, but there's really not much of a link between the answer and bullet
[1:02:23] <SeValentine> at least the music its helping SourPls
[1:02:26] <josh3sain> they beat the guy with sockssssssss filled with stuff right
[1:02:27] <+MarshallLee67> the answer does make sense the game just doesn't lead you to it basically at all
[1:02:30] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls the music helps
[1:02:33] <TropiusHunter> walkthrough time?
[1:02:34] <@DCN2049> chrollo logic
[1:02:38] <GarbageNirvana> Broken glass = broken vase?
[1:02:39] <bettysharkface> Pff
[1:02:39] <+Promessa_EX> nothing was covered with blood, so maybe it left the room?
[1:02:41] <Johnmaddened> yeahh this part is rough
[1:02:58] <heartlesshealer> How about beating her with gravel instead?
[1:02:58] <+shaidot> how would you contain all that gravel?
[1:03:01] <SirFancySwank> do you want a hint
[1:03:04] <HajimeNoStream> Im going crazy over chat saying the answer is logical while the game provides no logical link between the answer and the clues. Thats not how logic works
[1:03:05] <bettysharkface> Maybe try the escape route? Smash her head in the window?
[1:03:06] <layZman> its weird when you know the answer, because it doesn't make sense, except you know why it makes sense
[1:03:16] <GarbageNirvana> Imma be real I completely forgot what it was here
[1:03:26] <Sapphire_Breeze> it makes danganronpa sense
[1:03:39] <layZman> yeah it makes danganronpa sense
[1:03:52] <HajimeNoStream> Cool so it doesn't make sense
[1:03:54] <Darkred28> If he only knew
[1:03:56] <+shaidot> ...
[1:03:57] <filialpails> if only
[1:03:58] <+FxyDEV> ibuki is a cutie
[1:03:58] <layZman> not remotely
[1:04:02] <+Promessa_EX> well if you like it
[1:04:03] <+JailShmixRemix> She used the vase full of gravel PogChamp
[1:04:05] <+lemonsakee> yeah gravel doesnt make sense 1eyGoob
[1:04:17] <Johnmaddened> haha yeah if only it was
[1:04:22] <Run44forrest> the water from the fish tank washed the blood away hggHmm
[1:04:29] <+Promessa_EX> i love that the default answer is kill hinata
[1:04:33] <+lemonsakee> lets goo
[1:04:45] <+shaidot> I really just wanna give you the answer
[1:04:47] <CursedNobleman> ahh, chapter 2
[1:04:49] <SirFancySwank> i can say if you wamnt
[1:04:49] <Darkred28> The answer doesn't make sense either
[1:04:51] <layZman> plague's going to be so mad when he gets it
[1:04:53] <SeValentine> even the restart gives you plot AppaK
[1:04:58] <HajimeNoStream> You block heads already have he is just ignoring you
[1:05:07] <+MisterRockett> Does this game still have the agree mechanic? Or the topic steal?
[1:05:09] <+lemonsakee> can we give you half the answer
[1:05:11] <+MarshallLee67> do you want us to tell you the bullet or statement?
[1:05:14] <+MarshallLee67> like just one
[1:05:22] <SirFancySwank> swimsuit + gravel
[1:05:23] <layZman> this one is total danganronpa logic
[1:05:30] <xeros720> there's agreeing in this one, but topic steal must've been in 3
[1:05:33] <josh3sain> full metal jacket logic
[1:05:35] <heartlesshealer> broken glass broken vase idk
[1:05:35] <+lemonsakee> letsagoo
[1:05:38] <Darkred28> No
[1:05:39] <+shaidot> no
[1:05:41] <Dlent_> Topic steal is in this game
[1:05:42] <HajimeNoStream> Shoved the swimsuit in their ass and swung gravel around
[1:05:45] <layZman> no
[1:05:45] <+MarshallLee67> wrong bullet
[1:05:59] <josh3sain> filled the sock with stuff to beat someone
[1:06:02] <Johnmaddened> wrong bullet yeah
[1:06:02] <+Promessa_EX> it may be school swimsuit
[1:06:03] <+JailShmixRemix> wrong bullet
[1:06:13] <+lemonsakee> chigau
[1:06:13] <+JailShmixRemix> you did
[1:06:15] <bettysharkface> = A= Unless he asks, I don't thing you guys should be saying so much
[1:06:24] <heartlesshealer> can you close up a swimsuit into a sack?
[1:06:25] <Johnmaddened> vineSchut
[1:06:28] <+shaidot> it's the swimsuit
[1:06:29] <CursedNobleman> danganronpa in a nutshell. i dont know what to do, so imma shoot everything LUL
[1:06:37] <Run44forrest> hggGun
[1:06:38] <+JailShmixRemix> u used fish tank on everything
[1:06:41] <ChungusQuest> Just got here, is the MC a Snork?
[1:06:43] <Dlent_> So anyway, I started blasting
[1:06:43] <layZman> so i started blasting their arguments
[1:07:02] <TropiusHunter> i wonder what sonia's favorite nirvana album is?
[1:07:11] <+shaidot> swimsuit
[1:07:14] <Dlent_> What about broken glass, mother fucker?!
[1:07:16] <+JailShmixRemix> chat
[1:07:21] <CalderGaming> I always had a feeling this was a bad puzzle but I never had a large enough sample size of players to confirm
[1:07:23] <BigBanterCorbin> chat dont tell him what to do if he doesnt explicitly ask
[1:07:25] <layZman> go the opposite of common sense
[1:07:27] <+JailShmixRemix> PogChamp watch me solve this case
[1:07:28] <bettysharkface> Shut the fuck up
[1:07:33] <KgKid51> oh I see lol
[1:07:34] <+shaidot> alright
[1:07:38] <CursedNobleman> i forget, blue targets are to reinforce arguements and yellow are to contest right?
[1:07:46] <sosuke5> ok, woolie
[1:07:46] <+Promessa_EX> but the game makes you get it right lol
[1:07:50] <KgKid51> full metal jacket logic
[1:07:50] <+MarshallLee67> @CursedNobleman yeah, consent vs contradict
[1:07:50] <GarbageNirvana> If it makes you feel any better you're not the only one who's frustrated with this part of the game's logic
[1:07:51] <+JailShmixRemix> She used the fish tank gravel to beat her with a vase made of fish tank PogChamp
[1:08:01] <+lemonsakee> seesaw effect
[1:08:08] <+JailShmixRemix> Seesaw effect dekillASoul
[1:08:16] <sosuke5> ...
[1:08:18] <Johnmaddened> beaten with fists coated in gravel
[1:08:21] <+MarshallLee67> this is the hardest question to figure out in this game imo
[1:08:23] <CursedNobleman> oh right. now i remember this answer LUL
[1:08:25] <+Promessa_EX> m64Cry m64Cry m64Cry
[1:08:29] <Sapphire_Breeze> meat in the bone
[1:08:31] <Darkred28> Here we go, boys
[1:08:32] <+Promessa_EX> fuck
[1:08:35] <layZman> we established already that the vase was used to draw attention to the murder
[1:08:41] <+lemonsakee> SWIMSUIT GRAVEL
[1:08:42] <+JailShmixRemix> Swimsuit gravel
[1:08:45] <+MarshallLee67> swimsuit gravel
[1:08:45] <Darkred28> Ibuki gravel, swimsuit
[1:08:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> swimsuit gravel
[1:08:45] <Johnmaddened> gravel in the swimsuit.
[1:08:46] <+Promessa_EX> correct bullet
[1:08:48] <bettysharkface> Now you assholes can say
[1:08:48] <SirFancySwank> sweimsuit plus gravel
[1:08:55] <dlocke1991> swimsuit gravel
[1:08:55] <SeValentine> the most unexpected random shit marthComfy
[1:08:56] <BigBanterCorbin> +}
[1:08:57] <ChungusQuest> I'm picturing this process play out in real time like Morty using the crystal to win in court via sounding out random words
[1:08:58] <Darkred28> LUL
[1:08:58] <StrawberryLion> Cause of death was drowning, not a blow to the head?
[1:09:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:09:01] <+FxyDEV> CONSENT
[1:09:02] <AlonZombi> pocket gravel
[1:09:02] <Johnmaddened> YUP LUL
[1:09:06] <layZman> this fucking section man
[1:09:08] <+MarshallLee67> I AGREE WITH THAT
[1:09:10] <+JailShmixRemix> like a sock
[1:09:11] <CursedNobleman> blackjack someone
[1:09:11] <naoi0> Why would you use a swimsuit though
[1:09:12] <raveous> use it like a bludgeon
[1:09:13] <Johnmaddened> fuck that section
[1:09:15] <+Promessa_EX> you liked it on the first viewing and dismissed it lol
[1:09:15] <LunarRemix> The body wasn't wet, thus the cause of death wansn't used on the murder
[1:09:19] <Zebroneath> this one was really obtuse
[1:09:22] <SeValentine> SourPls right ....
[1:09:22] <LunarRemix> Dang
[1:09:23] <Luizabd> the swinsuit was in a bag
[1:09:23] <heartlesshealer> fill cloth with object
[1:09:23] <@DCN2049> that's really not an effective means of holding gravel either
[1:09:23] <Eightgutter> no blood
[1:09:23] <xeros720> this one is really indirect compared to every other one
[1:09:24] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:09:24] <SirFancySwank> pretty much
[1:09:26] <Yrefe> this is fanfic at this point
[1:09:28] <Darkred28> Welcome to Danganronpa!
[1:09:29] <LunarRemix> I mean the fishtank wasn't used as a weapon since the body wasn't wet
[1:09:30] <+MisterRockett> The evidence is the lack of any other weapon.
[1:09:31] <SeValentine> in what planet LMAO marthLUL
[1:09:32] <layZman> its one of those times its most danganronpa
[1:09:33] <SilverRoddo> Buureku
[1:09:39] <+Promessa_EX> it's the item that's missing
[1:09:43] <+MarshallLee67> nothing else in the room had blood on it so nothing in the room was used to kill her
[1:09:43] <+Promessa_EX> that would have had blood
[1:09:44] <Run44forrest> If you put the coins in the sock it doesn’t leave a bruise chat Kappa
[1:09:47] <heartlesshealer> yeah it's not as tight as Phoenix Wright
[1:09:48] <+lemonsakee> well it was hers
[1:09:52] <ChungusQuest> But then how does the game happen?
[1:09:57] <+MisterRockett> @HajimeNoStream No shut up tho.
[1:10:04] <naoi0> This is pretty much exactly wht happened.
[1:10:06] <layZman> its not the worst though
[1:10:06] <+reiface08> it's like they know
[1:10:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> no blood I guess
[1:10:17] <layZman> theres like one or two even worse
[1:10:20] <Sapphire_Breeze> but that's still dumb
[1:10:22] <lemoan> @heartlesshealer think that's an understatement
[1:10:22] <+lemonsakee> its danganronpa
[1:10:23] <+Nightweaver20xx> Oh my god Plague is streaming? Is it the end of the world?
[1:10:24] <SeValentine> ibuki with the big brain guesses
[1:10:24] <CalderGaming> this game does not deserve excuses
[1:10:25] <xeros720> i had to help someone with this part when the game came out
[1:10:25] <TropiusHunter> this song slaps tho
[1:10:27] <Andele1503> Well, it points out that the onahole can be randomly "correct"
[1:10:27] <+MisterRockett> @HajimeNoStream You providing?
[1:10:32] <CursedNobleman> the last murder case in this game is amazing tho LUL
[1:10:33] <+MarshallLee67> @layZman nah this is the worst by far
[1:10:34] <kentrix11> Some of there are just bad, not all the time but some.
[1:10:35] <KessOrangeSoda> I suspect you'd prefer the Sherlock Holmes games.
[1:10:35] <@DCN2049> knock it off guys
[1:10:37] <vladtet909> You know it's an asspull when the game acknowledges it as that..
[1:10:54] <layZman> @MarshallLee67 I'd disagree but depends on what difficulty you played and your logic process
[1:10:57] <SeValentine> Trueeeee leftiAyaya
[1:11:01] <Johnmaddened> uh huh sure thing Ibuki
[1:11:01] <naoi0> When the murder weapon is more convoluted than Clue
[1:11:06] <Run44forrest> How do you even fill the swimming suit with gravel it has like 5 holes
[1:11:20] <+MisterRockett> @Run44forrest It's cloth you can just twist it.
[1:11:22] <naoi0> Just use a sock
[1:11:22] <+reiface08> unless it's one of those one piece school japanese swimsuits
[1:11:26] <CursedNobleman> mikan best girl LUL
[1:11:33] <+Promessa_EX> i think they show a picture of the idea
[1:11:37] <bettysharkface> Well...I mean...swimsuits have a sort of pocket layer in the crotch...
[1:11:40] <xeros720> if it was like, "they found the swimsuit in a trashcan with gravel in it" or something needed to be evidence
[1:11:43] <heartlesshealer> japanese girl's swimsuit is a bunch of effort to keep the gravel in
[1:11:48] <CursedNobleman> @bettysharkface cmonBruh
[1:11:59] <bettysharkface> Nevermind it's stupid
[1:12:01] <naoi0> That looks like a crumpled candy wrapper
[1:12:03] <layZman> this is so out of the way rediculous
[1:12:04] <@DCN2049> yeah this was dumb
[1:12:06] <+Promessa_EX> that's the picture
[1:12:06] <Yrefe> or just use a sock
[1:12:07] <+ArchimerCXV> ' ' 'effective ' ' '
[1:12:08] <SeValentine> NotLikeThis the logic its ... unreal
[1:12:10] <+JailShmixRemix> @bettysharkface cmonBruh
[1:12:12] <kingra> Wow this IS stupid
[1:12:15] <+MarshallLee67> monokuma also said the murder weapon was something shown in the game
[1:12:16] <+reiface08> but aquariums too heavy plague
[1:12:18] <naoi0> FANTASTIC IDEA
[1:12:21] <BigBanterCorbin> yep that one is very dumb
[1:12:22] <heartlesshealer> like, how do you even get it to be tied like that?
[1:12:23] <Yrefe> the amount of effort in that knot is ridiculous
[1:12:23] <HajimeNoStream> Lmfao it makes sense
[1:12:24] <+MisterRockett> I think the point was to obfuscate the murder weapon to avoid getting caught xD
[1:12:26] <+lemonsakee> ace attorney would just contact the bitches ghost
[1:12:28] <HajimeNoStream> Okay game
[1:12:30] <+Promessa_EX> or lots of little stones!
[1:12:38] <bettysharkface> I understand a lot of you have never seen inside a girls swimsuit
[1:12:38] <+JailShmixRemix> I mean
[1:12:42] <JoshManVGH> A book. Piano Wire, a flute, a music stand
[1:12:43] <Yrefe> is so stupid it MUST be truth
[1:12:51] <Run44forrest> hggHmm
[1:12:54] <Arancet> its so convoluted it MUST be smart
[1:12:59] <HajimeNoStream> lmfao
[1:13:00] <@DCN2049> hahaha
[1:13:00] <CursedNobleman> 🍆✊ yeah, videogame is so genius LUL
[1:13:00] <SeValentine> leftiS its anime so i guess anything can be used as an item
[1:13:01] <bettysharkface> But there is a layer of material in the crotch area
[1:13:05] <Johnmaddened> LUL LUL LUL
[1:13:08] <+LordSDB> I super forgot this case

[1:46:55] <Andele1503> ebenso*
[1:46:56] <CursedNobleman> haribo sugarfree gummies use a laxative as a sweetener.

[1:47:39] <terminusterminal> I've never really seen any games translate voice acting across the pond well. COD doesn't do well in japanese voice acting and jap games don't do well with english.
[1:47:39] <omenesia> The whole trial pivoting on yellow gummi
[1:47:40] <YakumoYomi> I dislike piss-flavored gummies

[1:47:57] <+JailShmixRemix> DCN PogChamp
[1:48:05] <+FxyDEV> they didn't sign the brand contract
[1:48:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> all conjecture
[1:48:15] <SeValentine> quite a bummer you can't show badge as in phoenix AppaK
[1:48:22] <kiwicoffin> once you buy into children arguing to kill each other, you gotta loosen your standards of evidence
[1:48:24] <Ozavic> But really, Hiyoko needs to die
[1:48:24] <omenesia> No exclusivity deal like Pepsi got for the soda
[1:48:29] <+JailShmixRemix> rude
[1:48:33] <Ozavic> Fuyuhiko is right af
[1:48:34] <layZman> projection
[1:48:38] <+MisterRockett> You have to have a LOT of confidence in this person ONLY ever eating one brand of gummy bears.

[1:49:06] <layZman> the shit in the toilet!
[1:49:20] <holis_craiolis> I like how these games make possible cases,but when you think about it they are TOO possible they are very obviously manufactured to be solved
[1:49:29] <+Promessa_EX> "died instantly"
[1:49:41] <bettysharkface> Yeah she died straight away
[1:49:43] <Futurecity10> I hope the goblin isnt guilty
[1:49:54] <kiwicoffin> "manufactured" is very good word for this series
[1:49:59] <CursedNobleman> mikan best girl.
[1:50:09] <+JailShmixRemix> Nah she just died
[1:50:14] <layZman> @kiwicoffin thats why I like the Zero Escape series
[1:50:18] <omenesia> of course, someone built monokuma @kiwicoffin
[1:50:20] <terminusterminal> "Nah Mahiru died as she lived. Like a buster."
[1:50:25] <Ozavic> Akane is best girl, Nekomura is best boy
[1:50:26] <xeros720> your relationship will be stronger from this

[1:55:26] <+lemonsakee> this minigame is better in 3, the hangman stays forever though
[1:55:27] <+Promessa_EX> CU/T
[1:55:28] <+JailShmixRemix> ALLOW ME TO CUT THROUGH, YOUR WRONG
[1:55:30] <+MajorCrasher> they repeat for like 10-20 minutes. you're not meant to figure it out on the first rotation
[1:55:31] <+MisterRockett> This one comes back and it has the exact same issue I don't know why it was popular enough to get a second chance.
[1:55:45] <bettysharkface> This game has waaaaay too much padding
[1:55:47] <+ArchimerCXV> Stab. Lie.

[1:56:41] <kiwicoffin> the spell has been broken
[1:56:45] <thealsian> I only played V3, but I thought rebuttal showdown was fun as heck. Maybe because you don't have a cut limit and I spammed the focus gauge.
[1:56:53] <+lemonsakee> oh yeah this is when she was stinky
[1:56:54] <Ouimjuips> Stick Goblin

[1:59:46] <xeros720> just like how they made a plot point of her being stinky
[1:59:47] <Garrison27> ... I'll allow it
[1:59:49] <Ozavic> Ibuki is also top tier
[1:59:53] <xeros720> perverts all the way down
[1:59:54] <+JailShmixRemix> @HajimeNoStream nah
[1:59:57] <+ArchimerCXV> you know for a fact if you had to present the red herring you'd have to do some trike-brain gymnastics to prove it
[1:59:58] <+MisterRockett> A red herring up until this moment.
[1:59:58] <omenesia> Remember Mikan's embarassing pose?
[2:00:09] <bettysharkface> She's the only one willing to dress me

[2:00:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:00:40] <+lemonsakee> again, the uncensored shower scene exists
[2:00:40] <omenesia> I think they're all of age, at least in Japan. @HajimeNoStream
[2:00:43] <GarbageNirvana> @Ozavic Calm down son, it's just a drawing
[2:00:44] <+JailShmixRemix> LOL
[2:00:45] <+not_crabby> LUL
[2:00:48] <layZman> LUL

[2:01:00] <HajimeNoStream> @omenesia Wow fantastic defense buddy
[2:01:07] <+Promessa_EX> hiyoko is of age but mahiru nah
[2:01:16] <+JailShmixRemix> Why is there a tennis ball
[2:01:19] <+JailShmixRemix> in the background
[2:01:20] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:01:22] <HajimeNoStream> "Theyre of age in Nairobi"
[2:01:24] <YakumoYomi> LUL
[2:01:24] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[2:01:42] <kiwicoffin> they're of age in fake danganronpa land
[2:01:45] <+ArchimerCXV> Nagito looks like the kinda guy who would spend 5 hours trying to convince you homestuck is genius
[2:01:45] <bettysharkface> Gdi hahaha
[2:01:47] <+MajorCrasher> LUL LUL
[2:01:48] <+SWindleFeD> A great big clue
[2:01:49] <kiwicoffin> except the ones that aren't
[2:01:51] <tacostarvedbeast> Same tbh
[2:01:51] <layZman> looks like monami is just swinging
[2:01:54] <Lan_Ran> "Hey could you explain everything now that the player did all the logic puzzles?"
[2:01:58] <YakumoYomi> I hope this doesn't awaken something in me...
[2:02:02] <+Grossly_Incandescent_> i have a such a hard clue right now
[2:02:07] <tacostarvedbeast> I hope it does
[2:02:13] <+JailShmixRemix> she cant help it
[2:02:21] <Ozavic> Hiyoko is the worst character in the series IMO
[2:02:23] <tacostarvedbeast> Browser history needs more spice
[2:02:29] <layZman> I hate that they changed ibuki's middle finger but kept FUCK in the game
[2:02:31] <+not_crabby> LUL
[2:02:39] <CursedNobleman> back to the dumpster lying goblin
[2:02:42] <YakumoYomi> Yes, because getting caught in MULTIPLE lies in a murder trial doesn't arouse suspicion
[2:02:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Ozavic that's wrong!
[2:02:43] <layZman> seems a bit disjointed in censorship
[2:02:45] <+JailShmixRemix> krab PogChamp
[2:03:05] <Ozavic> @Sapphire_Breeze You're right, I forgot about Himiko in V3
[2:03:09] <terminusterminal> Which has better music these games or ace attorney?
[2:03:10] <SeValentine> SourPls the jams
[2:03:11] <CursedNobleman> i think they sign letters with the full names in japan.
[2:03:13] <+JailShmixRemix> Himiko is great
[2:03:15] <+JailShmixRemix> how dare you
[2:03:16] <layZman> ace
[2:03:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> @Ozavic now with this I can agree
[2:03:33] <holis_craiolis> actually everyone in the game has the samejand writing since the art team didnt knew how to make different ones
[2:03:35] <bettysharkface> Yeah
[2:03:36] <+JailShmixRemix> Angie is much worse than himiko
[2:03:40] <Ozavic> @Sapphire_Breeze I'm glad you settled this
[2:03:53] <CursedNobleman> @JailShmixRemix I AGREE!
[2:03:58] <+lemonsakee> mahiru would
[2:03:59] <tacostarvedbeast> Plague is part dragon? I always suspected
[2:04:04] <TropiusHunter> @terminusterminal these games, but ace attorney has the best track between the two
[2:04:19] <bettysharkface> No no
[2:04:21] <Ozavic> @JailShmixRemix Angie is annoying too, but Himiko is worse IMO because 'it's magic'
[2:04:25] <bettysharkface> Mahiru
[2:04:40] <Ozavic> Let's be fair, V3 doesn't have a great cast :/
[2:04:42] <+JailShmixRemix> @Ozavic Atleast himiko can get better, angie just gets worse for me
[2:04:46] <+MajorCrasher> it literally showed you that it added it LUL
[2:04:49] <TropiusHunter> @Ozavic honestly i think toko is the worst
[2:04:59] <+JailShmixRemix> V3 has 3-4 good characters
[2:05:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Someone set em up
[2:05:13] <SuperVaderMan> ah, so the text in the graphic is exactly the same, because they were lazy, got it
[2:05:26] <Ozavic> @TropiusHunter I wanted to like her, but god damn she's just babies first feminist strawman
[2:05:48] <bettysharkface> Peko sure has been quiet since the gummy bear thing
[2:06:03] <+JailShmixRemix> Shes taking a SHIIIT
[2:06:04] <thealsian> Toko or Tenko?
[2:06:04] <+ArchimerCXV> thinking about another big shit
[2:06:05] <CursedNobleman> friggin hiyoko lying all the time and has no cred
[2:06:08] <+Grossly_Incandescent_> i hope they show more of that red herring Kreygasm
[2:06:13] <kingra> LUL
[2:06:27] <Johnmaddened> wait till v3
[2:06:28] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:06:30] <kingra> I think that happens in this
[2:06:33] <layZman> v3
[2:06:35] <LunarRemix> They'd just lose?
[2:06:45] <$Rshiners> plague IS the main character
[2:06:49] <+JailShmixRemix> jphSad
[2:06:52] <Ozavic> Byakuya would have killed someone if 2 people didn't die in case 3 IMO
[2:06:52] <TropiusHunter> hiro, hifumi, leon, toko and mondo
[2:06:54] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:07:01] <tacostarvedbeast> Hina would have gotten everyone killed obviously
[2:07:02] <Ouimjuips> Wait... Contrails won't kill you?
[2:07:11] <layZman> what is a contrail?
[2:07:13] <+FxyDEV> mondo is smart emotionally
[2:07:14] <+JailShmixRemix> hes lying
[2:07:18] <CursedNobleman> @layZman airplane trail
[2:07:20] <+JailShmixRemix> Contrails are venomous
[2:07:21] <+Promessa_EX> @scrimbim1 it's just ice
[2:07:27] <CrimsonFox777> Everything kills you.
[2:07:28] <kiwicoffin> wow he really contributed there
[2:07:32] <layZman> oh they aren't called chemtrails?
[2:07:38] <omenesia> It's the opposite of a protrail, @layZman
[2:07:40] <holis_craiolis> @PlagueOfGripes it would be like being in a group with 10 paiges
[2:07:53] <CursedNobleman> @omenesia spyWhy
[2:07:53] <layZman> I've heard of the chemtrail conspiracy
[2:08:06] <kiwicoffin> a question I will not answer
[2:08:24] <tacostarvedbeast> Feels like a lot more competent people in DR2 for sure
[2:08:38] <TropiusHunter> for anyone thats played this game, are we close to the end? sleep time is around the corner
[2:08:45] <+JailShmixRemix> Uh
[2:08:46] <omenesia> A lot fewer airheads in DR2
[2:08:48] <+RunoEddie> yeah, this time the "Byakuya" is actually smart
[2:08:50] <+JailShmixRemix> Not really?
[2:08:54] <+lemonsakee> theres still a whole thing to go through
[2:08:56] <Ozavic> @tacostarvedbeast No spoils, but the game cleans up the cast nicely towards the end
[2:08:56] <kiwicoffin> so...evil
[2:08:57] <+RunoEddie> while also being a dick
[2:08:58] <omenesia> @TropiusHunter Very far away
[2:09:02] <holis_craiolis> @TropiusHunter mope neither close of this case nor the game
[2:09:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> She is dead goblin
[2:09:10] <holis_craiolis> nope*
[2:09:11] <YakumoYomi> Oh no! Anyway...
[2:09:17] <+JailShmixRemix> We've got maybe 45 minutes left? or an Hour
[2:09:18] <layZman> this dude is a dickhead
[2:09:18] <TropiusHunter> i meant the case
[2:09:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:09:22] <TropiusHunter> not the game
[2:09:23] <Ozavic> HOPE IS DOPE
[2:09:29] <sosuke5> but hope tho
[2:09:30] <kiwicoffin> that's actually an interesting detail. Why WOULDN'T they check in on this black horse?
[2:09:30] <omenesia> Doing it for da Hope
[2:09:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> based hopeman
[2:09:33] <+lemonsakee> hope
[2:09:34] <VroomSoon> it would result in a lot of despair
[2:09:36] <+lemonsakee> hopeman
[2:09:40] <holis_craiolis> wer are like half way through this case
[2:09:40] <+JailShmixRemix> HOPE BONER
[2:09:43] <+RunoEddie> the ultimates have to shine! otherwise what's the point
[2:09:44] <+MajorCrasher> oh boy you don't even know yet
[2:09:49] <+YabbaTroll> he just likes hope tho
[2:09:49] <glass_marcus> this dude loves Danganronpa
[2:09:53] <kingra> Hope Chadman
[2:10:00] <SuperVaderMan> Oh you don't get killed for being an accomplice in this game's logic? Wow
[2:10:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jails are cool
[2:10:01] <+JailShmixRemix> I mean atleast they tried to tie him up
[2:10:03] <Johnmaddened> LUL LUL
[2:10:07] <+JailShmixRemix> Rather than just let him be
[2:10:07] <kiwicoffin> *looks at the script on his wrist*
[2:10:08] <YakumoYomi> LUL
[2:10:11] <+Promessa_EX> well
[2:10:13] <layZman> when even Ibuki is fed up with you, you fucked up
[2:10:17] <+YabbaTroll> hmmmm
[2:10:19] <tacostarvedbeast> Nagito balances out the fact there are more smart people this time around
[2:10:20] <+zepelinnn1> last blow
[2:10:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> hmmmm
[2:10:22] <+zepelinnn1> probably
[2:10:23] <kiwicoffin> lightly beating him for 30 hours
[2:10:24] <Ozavic> Whoever lands killing blow I suppose
[2:10:25] <+ArchimerCXV> simultaneous dropkick
[2:10:25] <BlueLunecy> Take turns beating him to death so you can all go home
[2:10:28] <CrimsonFox777> Only whoever dealt the killing blow.
[2:10:28] <JohnClaggart> multiple people killed in the first one didnt they?
[2:10:28] <CursedNobleman> LUL i wonder if multiple people kill someone.
[2:10:29] <kingra> Who delevered the killing blow
[2:10:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dont worry about it
[2:10:29] <sosuke5> you'll find out later...
[2:10:31] <+JailShmixRemix> Everyone shoots him at the same time
[2:10:33] <+lemonsakee> theyd still have to do the trial
[2:10:36] <+MajorCrasher> The last person to touch him is the killer
[2:10:38] <layZman> guess whoever got the killing blow
[2:10:40] <+RunoEddie> the rules is that it can't happen, only one is the killer
[2:10:40] <+lemonsakee> its last person
[2:10:44] <TropiusHunter> alright have fun plague
[2:10:45] <omenesia> CarlSmile murder science
[2:10:50] <+YabbaTroll> videogame killfeed rules
[2:10:50] <SuperVaderMan> I guess it's like Return of the Obrah Dinn, where it's the one guy that shot him amidst the firing squad LUL
[2:10:51] <Garrison27> Hot Potato rules
[2:10:53] <CrimsonFox777> Alright, who wailed on the liver?
[2:10:53] <YakumoYomi> Whoever had the best DPS
[2:10:54] <Ozavic> There has to be a cause of death, everyone else just softened them up
[2:10:55] <tacostarvedbeast> It’s mmorpg rules, last hit gets the exp
[2:10:57] <+ArchimerCXV> yeah, whichever student had the biggest number explode of their body, whoever had the highest deeps
[2:10:58] <+JailShmixRemix> yeah...dont worry about it...
[2:10:59] <thealsian> One with the killing blow is the blackened
[2:10:59] <Solokaldaka> et tu brute him
[2:11:06] <TheAntiNihilist> In that case HE DIED OF A LONELY HEART
[2:11:11] <+not_crabby> sniff
[2:11:12] <+JailShmixRemix> PogChamp Cyanide
[2:11:15] <holis_craiolis> it takes the killing blow not the ones that did damage,dr1 mentiones it I think
[2:11:20] <terminusterminal> Why not just start with that? Why not just say that somebody knocked you out?
[2:11:20] <Daxalog> "Does this smell like Chloroform"?
[2:11:20] <kingra> She smelled herself
[2:11:22] <CursedNobleman> chloroform
[2:11:22] <+MajorCrasher> Cholorform
[2:11:23] <BlueLunecy> Chloroform?
[2:11:23] <CrimsonFox777> Chloroform?
[2:11:24] <YakumoYomi> Chloroform doesn't work
[2:11:28] <terminusterminal> Why say you fell asleep
[2:11:35] <CrimsonFox777> It takes a couple minutes for it to work.
[2:11:35] <YakumoYomi> Several minutes
[2:11:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Smell that ether
[2:11:36] <xeros720> anethesia is a hard science
[2:11:36] <Ozavic> Takes like 10  minutes
[2:11:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> you need like 5 minutes
[2:11:43] <kingra> IMAGINE THE SMELL
[2:11:46] <heartlesshealer> it needs time to circulate
[2:11:47] <+skraem_0> holy shit ur online, is it just time zone diff or do u barely stream?
[2:11:49] <layZman> nobody answer this with full confidence :|
[2:11:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> also you can die from it I think
[2:11:58] <omenesia> all the smells, kingra
[2:12:04] <+boriss96> Is super dangerous too
[2:12:04] <Dlent_> I would have loved if Sakura had just killed literally everyone in the first game before monokuma made the rule specifically to stop her from doing that.
[2:12:11] <+ArchimerCXV> Goblin Bitch Medicine
[2:12:17] <MelBrooksKA> My brain forgets things even when I was young
[2:12:18] <kiwicoffin> Kinda true
[2:12:21] <+RunoEddie> Sakura would NEVER
[2:12:25] <+not_crabby> yah
[2:12:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> I already hate her
[2:12:27] <kingra> Yeah?
[2:12:29] <omenesia> Poor Mikan
[2:12:29] <+Promessa_EX> menhera
[2:12:30] <layZman> yup
[2:12:31] <CursedNobleman> a sexy sexy abuse victim
[2:12:31] <Ozavic> Mikan is bad mmkay
[2:12:34] <+lemonsakee> she likes it
[2:12:34] <+JailShmixRemix> Did you do her events yet plague @PlagueOfGripes
[2:12:37] <+MajorCrasher> hoo boy just wait...
[2:12:41] <kentrix11> Well they do use it to make you feel for her.
[2:12:49] <holis_craiolis> OH you DONT even know how much of an abuse victim she is
[2:12:51] <kentrix11> So idk if it's for funnies all the time.
[2:12:57] <+JailShmixRemix> Oh okay
[2:13:03] <+JailShmixRemix> Yeah
[2:13:07] <layZman> school mode is a godsend
[2:13:23] <Ozavic> Gotta pick a fav and max them out
[2:13:24] <kiwicoffin> what if I told you that's the point
[2:13:27] <SeValentine> overtime
[2:13:28] <omenesia> You have to play through the school mode to get to know people
[2:13:30] <+Promessa_EX> it's kind of a side effect of having to kill them off
[2:13:30] <+lemonsakee> what about fat byakuya
[2:13:31] <holis_craiolis> school mode in this game is actually entertaining
[2:13:36] <+JailShmixRemix> One of my least favorite parts of any of the games, you either have to shotgun a single person and hope they dont die or just give up
[2:13:41] <+JailShmixRemix> and wait till after game
[2:13:47] <kentrix11> The autor as a drooling fetish I'm pretty sure.
[2:13:48] <+RunoEddie> probably not, but did you do a free time event with Nagito before he revealed himself as crazy?
[2:13:57] <+ArchimerCXV> Reall want to hear Hiyoko call someone a 'ratchet-ass ho'
[2:14:02] <kiwicoffin> If you forget you friends, is it any different from forgetting who you are?
[2:14:05] <+RunoEddie> because if you didn't, it's locked forever
[2:14:07] <tacostarvedbeast> Who does plague like in this group I wonder, hiyoko first obviously
[2:14:10] <thealsian> Would you perfer it if you could hang out with as many people till the next plot point?
[2:14:18] <omenesia> Akane, @tacostarvedbeast
[2:14:20] <layZman> plague the underwear hunter
[2:14:31] <Arancet> yep
[2:14:33] <+Promessa_EX> i just look up what gifts people really like
[2:14:34] <+JailShmixRemix> yeah, its really shit
[2:14:48] <tacostarvedbeast> Ahh akane duh
[2:14:50] <+JailShmixRemix> Honestly just waiting to school mode is ideal
[2:14:52] <GarbageNirvana> People have made spoiler-free optimal walkthroughs out there
[2:14:55] <+lemonsakee> they killed leon and the idol girl first because the artists were sick of drawing them
[2:15:03] <johngamefreak> that's why they have dating sim mode as a postgame
[2:15:03] <SuperVaderMan> She's a horrible goblin, but she's not a killer
[2:15:04] <syanplague> you can replay the same chapter and the free time events still count
[2:15:11] <+JailShmixRemix> 68 year old
[2:15:11] <+Promessa_EX> her age just doubled lol
[2:15:11] <kingra> What a sad 62 year old BibleThump
[2:15:15] <layZman> upset 200 year old goblin
[2:15:20] <+Stunstark> I'm guessing your early impressions aren't that great so far?
[2:15:20] <blackskulldragon18> 120 year ol
[2:15:21] <arkv01> she'll be a granny by the time this trial is over VoHiYo
[2:15:22] <BlueLunecy> Gottem
[2:15:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> This loli was old when the world was young
[2:15:29] <heartlesshealer> bitches are not human, got it
[2:15:30] <+Heart0fInk> Good one
[2:15:30] <Sapphire_Breeze> sus

[2:15:36] <+MajorCrasher> LUL LUL
[2:15:37] <Ozavic> Gottem
[2:15:38] <+ArchimerCXV> fuckin' gottem
[2:15:39] <+RunoEddie> I tried so hard to talk to Nagito during the game, but I never did his first free time during the first chapter, so I just wasted my free time events doing so
[2:15:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[2:15:47] <+MajorCrasher> holy fuck plague LUL
[2:15:48] <CrimsonFox777> Holy shit LUL
[2:15:53] <+Promessa_EX> it's all about hope
[2:15:55] <kiwicoffin> To kill one guy
[2:16:00] <layZman> HOPE
[2:16:00] <+not_crabby> nagaito is a stupid cunt
[2:16:02] <+not_crabby> hes the besty
[2:16:03] <+lemonsakee> hope
[2:16:05] <omenesia> The big hope boi
[2:16:05] <+JailShmixRemix> Touch my HOPE HAJIME
[2:16:07] <+Promessa_EX> KIBOU
[2:16:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Maybe you sister should have fought back Kappa
[2:16:15] <+lemonsakee> get used to hearing about hope
[2:16:16] <terminusterminal> Nagito shut up, you're not interesting
[2:16:20] <+Promessa_EX> morally grey
[2:16:28] <CursedNobleman> @not_crabby hes good, but he aint got nothing on the stupid midget in V3 LUL
[2:16:28] <+JailShmixRemix> But the ladies love him plague
[2:16:30] <+ArchimerCXV> dont call this moral gray, i will shit so hard dangan
[2:16:31] <blackskulldragon18> Hope Biscuit
[2:16:36] <omenesia> morally absent
[2:16:39] <TheAntiNihilist> Nagito is best boy. prove me wrong
[2:16:39] <+not_crabby> i mean in this game
[2:16:40] <bettysharkface> SOggybees
[2:16:43] <Ozavic> But HOPE Is DOPE
[2:16:46] <Ouimjuips> It is
[2:16:46] <+JailShmixRemix> more or less correct
[2:16:48] <SuperVaderMan> Just mindless monologuing
[2:16:49] <layZman> hes not morally grey he's morally transluscent
[2:16:50] <+HawkGoggles2> But that's all this series has.
[2:16:53] <+lemonsakee> they will do it every single trial till the end of the series
[2:16:54] <YakumoYomi> Agreed
[2:17:03] <theloganbrand> The Light NEEDS the Darkness
[2:17:15] <lemoan> Sling her like a mace
[2:17:16] <tacostarvedbeast> I do enjoy when they point it out in the incredibles movie
[2:17:17] <TheAntiNihilist> might want to quit this series then
[2:17:18] <YakumoYomi> "We're not so different, hero!"
[2:17:19] <+Promessa_EX> 希望と絶望
[2:17:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Whip En
[2:17:27] <Daxalog> Same when characters start talking about "the nature of humans"
[2:17:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Whip Em both
[2:17:31] <Ouimjuips> Is Plague a Cracker?
[2:17:35] <vladtet909> Why does the rope keep vanishing?
[2:17:42] <+JailShmixRemix> Plague's a dragon
[2:17:43] <lemoan> nope
[2:17:46] <lucky_icarus> Thats why the Nagito of V3 is WAY better. he doesn't monologs of abstract bullshit
[2:17:50] <layZman> ha I remember that marketing
[2:17:54] <layZman> I'm old
[2:17:54] <+ArchimerCXV> the bitter truth of being 5' 11" fuyuhiko?

[2:18:10] <+JailShmixRemix> fuyuhiko is far from 5'11
[2:18:11] <+RunoEddie> @lucky_icarus really? I thought he was a lot more annoying
[2:18:15] <Ozavic> Love this song more than I should
[2:18:18] <SuperVaderMan> I hate these bear designs btw
[2:18:22] <bettysharkface> Bathroom break~
[2:18:23] <CursedNobleman> HALFWAY POINT!

[2:18:57] <layZman> two man japanese comedy shows
[2:19:00] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls
[2:19:00] <TheAntiNihilist> @plagueofgripes how do you like the music?
[2:19:03] <theloganbrand> Monomi's theme slaps
[2:19:06] <orochisdayoff> Nanu
[2:19:11] <+lemonsakee> Manzai comedy
[2:19:13] <+boriss96> The music  is great
[2:19:15] <terminusterminal> It's like they're trying to be a japanese game show
[2:19:16] <+alphonseisbest> probably a reference to a JP tv show
[2:19:20] <lucky_icarus> @runoeddie We'll he doesn't halt the trail to talk about literally nothing, so he def beats Nagito in my book
[2:19:21] <omenesia> Absurdist comedy
[2:19:21] <CursedNobleman> the despair island theme is my favorite
[2:19:24] <+JailShmixRemix> Japanese humour SourPls
[2:19:27] <+lemonsakee> The music is really fantastic in this one
[2:19:29] <kentrix11> Sometimes is Kodaka bitching about society.
[2:19:35] <omenesia> My favorite is way at the end. BibleThump
[2:19:41] <tacostarvedbeast> Maybe it’s a language barrier thing?
[2:19:46] <TheAntiNihilist> I see that
[2:19:49] <+SWindleFeD> I really dislike Monomi's look
[2:19:50] <CursedNobleman> chocobo fart rap LUL
[2:19:50] <+ArchimerCXV> got it, hate due recompense
[2:19:55] <omenesia> Gold Saucer theme, oh god
[2:20:14] <LunarRemix> Isn't it the point? To sound artificial, industrial?
[2:20:25] <TheAntiNihilist> true but I like the electronic remixes best personally
[2:20:29] <+ArchimerCXV> all i hear is Nanully...and it's awful
[2:20:29] <Ozavic> IMO the Monokuma bits is him laughing at you, the situation, etc. Like he can just say nonsense and you can do nothing about it. He's in control and there's no point into reading into his actions
[2:20:39] <tacostarvedbeast> Due recompense dough
[2:20:39] <+SWindleFeD> I'm thinking the killer is that bionicle looking shitbird
[2:20:40] <orochisdayoff> Fart rap LUL

[2:25:09] <terminusterminal> This is a winning formula right here.
[2:25:10] <+derg0ns> They made it slightly beter in 3
[2:25:12] <+JailShmixRemix> this one is great PogChamp
[2:25:16] <+JailShmixRemix> yes

[2:25:21] <+hrbeck_> Cowabunga
[2:25:22] <glass_marcus> sonic level actually
[2:25:22] <bezzy_benz> logic dive is the least annoying min game imo
[2:25:23] <kingra> It is
[2:25:26] <thealsian> It's not that hard.
[2:25:26] <+Promessa_EX> i think you just run over the letters
[2:25:31] <CursedNobleman> the action games in DGN are just boring. the thinky games are actually interesting
[2:25:34] <+JailShmixRemix> Have you ever played Hexagon? PogChamp
[2:25:37] <bettysharkface> God this sounds so stupid lets go
[2:25:40] <CrimsonFox777> Pretty much
[2:25:44] <Teyaric> oh man grandpa 2. the end section of the plot is amazing but the anime stupid is off the charts
[2:25:53] <omenesia> It's a mental construct
[2:25:57] <+Ragnakawaii> don't you play minigames when you think
[2:25:57] <CrimsonFox777> Thinking and connecting the dots is hard.
[2:25:57] <thealsian> It's a tunnel skateboarding thing.
[2:25:59] <CursedNobleman> its a metaphor about looking deep ins-SHUT UP
[2:25:59] <+teriyaki_drinker> are we playing runner 2
[2:26:03] <VroomSoon> Is this what gets changed into the driving in 3?

[2:26:14] <+JailShmixRemix> they give u a lot of time actually
[2:26:15] <xeros720> yeah, the brake is crucial to be able to read
[2:26:18] <+MisterRockett> They actually do.
[2:26:21] <+MicCloud> this is how hajime's brain works
[2:26:22] <+teriyaki_drinker> flash game time
[2:26:24] <+lemonsakee> the brake was never used once
[2:26:25] <tacostarvedbeast> It’s your fault for thinking you wanted to play a new mini game right about now
[2:26:26] <+SWindleFeD> Just cheese it by pausing the game every time you see the road split
[2:26:32] <+JailShmixRemix> seriously a flash game

[2:29:26] <Ozavic> Oh awesome
[2:29:37] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:29:37] <+JailShmixRemix> Lol
[2:29:40] <+not_crabby> nice
[2:29:40] <bettysharkface> Is this supposed to be...fun...
[2:29:44] <Samex_Comex> SSX tricky
[2:29:47] <bettysharkface> It seems like a waste of time
[2:29:54] <xeros720> it's pretty dumb
[2:29:55] <kingra> Yeah
[2:29:55] <+JailShmixRemix> yeah pretty much
[2:30:08] <+not_crabby> man the post processing hates this shit
[2:30:08] <CursedNobleman> i concur
[2:30:08] <Ozavic> Welcome to dangganpoppa @bettysharkface
[2:30:13] <+JailShmixRemix> it has to make it a game somehow LUL
[2:30:13] <xeros720> nonstop debates are pretty much the only thing that works
[2:30:15] <TheAntiNihilist> INTERACTIVE
[2:30:16] <LucentWulf> its the information superhighway
[2:30:21] <Dlent_> This is just happening in Hinata’s head at all times
[2:30:25] <+JailShmixRemix> Nonstop debates also barely work tbh
[2:30:26] <kingra> BRAINBLAST
[2:30:32] <GarbageNirvana> The beach
[2:30:33] <LunarRemix> It's weird because Ace Attorney does it fine with just dialogue
[2:30:34] <GarbageNirvana> The killer was a crab
[2:30:36] <xeros720> yeah, it'll drop you if you're wrong
[2:30:36] <tacostarvedbeast> Would you feel better if you were in a car instead ?
[2:30:40] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:30:42] <CursedNobleman> @kingra i was just thinking that
[2:30:44] <+JailShmixRemix> you die if ur wrong
[2:30:45] <xeros720> and force you to redo part of the track
[2:30:45] <+derg0ns> Phoenix seems slightly better in that regard but the minigame are very few and far between
[2:30:46] <SuperVaderMan> Ace attorney never had this problem, right?
[2:30:48] <+Promessa_EX> 3 has a little car
[2:30:48] <omenesia> You'll know if you get it wrong
[2:30:49] <LunarRemix> It's all about pacing I guess
[2:30:49] <+Promessa_EX> lol
[2:30:56] <CursedNobleman> @tacostarvedbeast and picking up floozie evidence!
[2:31:04] <terminusterminal> That's the truest shit I ever heard Hiyoko
[2:31:05] <Shadope342> something something mind palace
[2:31:08] <blackskulldragon18> Called out
[2:31:10] <+lemonsakee> ace attorney also manages to be stupid but work
[2:31:11] <Solokaldaka> LUL
[2:31:18] <LunarRemix> I mean
[2:31:22] <Ozavic> ...Okay that's a good line, even if I hate her
[2:31:23] <+JailShmixRemix> japanese please
[2:31:29] <LunarRemix> If you're going to write an anime video game you might as well get stupid sometimes
[2:31:33] <tacostarvedbeast> I imagine plague always has that face
[2:31:33] <Samex_Comex> Oh shit the MC is Doug Funnie!
[2:31:37] <theloganbrand> unless....

[2:31:53] <RadioRaptor> LUL
[2:31:58] <heartlesshealer> gee I wonder where
[2:31:59] <bettysharkface> Ace Attorney feels a lot better in terms of game play, and ridiculous plot points
[2:32:06] <Arancet> crap!
[2:32:17] <+JailShmixRemix> Plague PogChamp
[2:32:21] <Ozavic> *cough* Bodydoor

[2:34:30] <+lemonsakee> nanami my gamer wife...
[2:34:36] <CursedNobleman> these are paper thin anime waifus plague.
[2:34:40] <Samex_Comex> They are thin anime people
[2:34:44] <+not_crabby> they kinda are
[2:34:48] <xeros720> you got it, pretty sure the writers weren't aware how big those actually are
[2:34:50] <+lemonsakee> theyre the size of a japanese woman
[2:34:53] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:34:53] <Ozavic> The cases are big
[2:34:54] <Teyaric> tiny anime people. they totally are.
[2:34:54] <bettysharkface> Plague, these people are clearly 2d, lol
[2:35:04] <+lemonsakee> technically they are 2D
[2:35:04] <+Promessa_EX> they've always been paper
[2:35:06] <+shaidot> lmao
[2:35:06] <+thatdamncoyote> Everyone in this game is 2 dimensions
[2:35:08] <xeros720> they are made to hold surfboards and not much else
[2:35:11] <+JailShmixRemix> I mean, we can check the characters heights lol
[2:35:15] <Pippinitus> Maybe its a case for multiple surfboards or something stupid
[2:35:16] <TheAntiNihilist> JAPAN SIZED PEOPLE THO
[2:35:18] <+SWindleFeD> Well I mean the surfboard case wouldn't have to have been fully closed for someone to hide in it
[2:35:21] <theloganbrand> They scissor
[2:35:22] <+JailShmixRemix> they scissor each other
[2:35:23] <+derg0ns> oragami
[2:35:24] <RadioRaptor> LUL
[2:35:25] <tacostarvedbeast> So the killer was Mario?

[2:35:28] <+lemonsakee> lmao
[2:35:28] <+Promessa_EX> they scissor
[2:35:29] <Daxalog> Like how they do in Snipper Clips
[2:35:31] <heartlesshealer> you pull the tab to activate the pop up feature
[2:35:31] <LucentWulf> scissoring is a lot more dangerous
[2:35:32] <CrimsonFox777> why
[2:35:38] <Johnmaddened> they roll up together, I dunno
[2:35:43] <Garrison27> Its like a pop up book
[2:35:46] <silverira> they get stacked like a house of cards
[2:35:47] <Samex_Comex> They peal off each other each other like stickers
[2:35:58] <CursedNobleman> ahh. just like tinder.
[2:36:04] <$Rezca> art and numbers do not mix well
[2:36:06] <TheAntiNihilist> oh right lol
[2:36:07] <xeros720> that's why all male protags are 180 cm
[2:36:09] <kingra> IMAGINE
[2:36:13] <+lemonsakee> THE GRAY MAN
[2:36:17] <heartlesshealer> THE FEET DON'T EVEN FIT
[2:36:18] <+JailShmixRemix> 7ft tall like americans, but also able to fit in a japanese home
[2:36:20] <terminusterminal> Is he just fucking with her
[2:36:20] <silverira> LUL
[2:36:24] <bettysharkface> This is just...
[2:36:29] <Johnmaddened> it's him mr. grey culprit man
[2:36:31] <+JailShmixRemix> because its danganronpa
[2:36:33] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:36:35] <xeros720> but yeah, that's already double the size of an actual surfboard case
[2:36:39] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[2:36:47] <+hrbeck_> HE DOESNT EVEN FIT IN THE PICTURE
[2:36:47] <bettysharkface> Ibuki...please
[2:36:48] <CursedNobleman> god. i can smell my breath wearing a mask. imagine being stuck in a surfboard container.
[2:36:49] <TheAntiNihilist> horror?
[2:36:53] <+sasparillatango> none of these things make sense
[2:36:59] <Dlent_> There he is! The killer is that gray man!
[2:37:07] <+not_crabby> so i see shes taking a vow of silence
[2:37:10] <+lemonsakee> but remember miss sato likes white rice
[2:37:17] <kingra> THAT gray MAN
[2:37:19] <+HawkGoggles2> No, you have to "think"
[2:37:23] <+lemonsakee> the gray man
[2:37:25] <thealsian> Hiyoko checked the shower room?
[2:37:30] <heartlesshealer> how would someone fit in there with clothes on adding that extra bulk?
[2:37:32] <MelBrooksKA> I know I've said some stupid shit when I repeat things I've heard
[2:37:38] <kentrix11> D gray man
[2:38:01] <+hrbeck_> Ah, high school bullying- the lens of the greatest despair
[2:38:07] <Solokaldaka> but scene clean up takes time
[2:38:09] <+JailShmixRemix> @heartlesshealer Tiny paper people
[2:38:10] <TheAntiNihilist> yuuuup
[2:38:12] <$Rezca> that is some among us tactics

[2:38:44] <bettysharkface> I like that logic
[2:38:55] <+lemonsakee> I want to be punched!
[2:39:06] <Samex_Comex> What?
[2:39:07] <terminusterminal> lol so random
[2:39:10] <kentrix11> Reference.
[2:39:11] <layZman> japanese shows
[2:39:12] <+JailShmixRemix> same monokuma
[2:39:41] <Ouimjuips> That we know of
[2:39:46] <wolfen091> yay plague time
[2:39:46] <Ozavic> You didn't mention it either though Plague-kun
[2:39:48] <CrimsonFox777> Hiyoko and Soda
[2:39:51] <bettysharkface> Jumpsuit
[2:39:55] <heartlesshealer> can man
[2:40:01] <Johnmaddened> Pepsiman
[2:40:04] <Ouimjuips> Murder, japense girl, and the one who "found" her
[2:40:08] <xeros720> they are all pun names, probably
[2:40:12] <terminusterminal> Akane maxed out. To no surprise
[2:40:15] <bettysharkface> Goblin, kendo, and jumpsuit
[2:40:16] <Teyaric> oh yeah. the death game mechanics are a lot bigger a deal in this one
[2:40:28] <Daxalog> Why is her star full? Is she sick?
[2:40:42] <heartlesshealer> might be cumulative....
[2:40:42] <CrimsonFox777> Doesn't have to be at the same time.
[2:40:44] <xeros720> i think it's cumulative yeah
[2:40:45] <bettysharkface> Or maybe...yakuza?
[2:40:47] <wolfen091> kill em all let God sort em out
[2:40:49] <+JailShmixRemix> its cumulative
[2:40:49] <Maids4lyfe> it's full of pee or something
[2:40:54] <tacostarvedbeast> Maybe it was Jesus ?
[2:40:56] <+lemonsakee> among
[2:41:08] <Ouimjuips> S U S
[2:41:21] <+JailShmixRemix> hes just making up the rules now LUL
[2:41:22] <Maids4lyfe> teaSus
[2:41:33] <Shadope342> LUL
[2:41:35] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[2:41:36] <terminusterminal> ??????
[2:41:39] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[2:41:45] <TheAntiNihilist> dual personality = 2 people?
[2:41:52] <kingra> ;U;
[2:41:52] <layZman> @JailShmixRemix he's always making up rules, there are no rules in these games besides what monokuma makes up
[2:41:55] <kingra> LUL
[2:41:57] <Ozavic> Because Monokuma is a bitch
[2:42:05] <+MisterRockett> Didn't DR1 use it for a deduction like, twice?
[2:42:05] <+JailShmixRemix> @layZman pretty much
[2:42:05] <YakumoYomi> Dumb Bear Cuck LUL
[2:42:18] <+JailShmixRemix> @MisterRockett multiple times yes
[2:42:22] <layZman> literally he has suspended this rule and changed every rule at least once in the series
[2:42:42] <bettysharkface> It's gotta be yakuza
[2:42:46] <SuperVaderMan> So the rule can just arbitrarily include the killer? Huh??
[2:42:49] <CrimsonFox777> So Hiyoko, Soda, the murderer, and one more.
[2:42:56] <Ozavic> For those confused, they miscounted once in DR1, that's why that scene exists
[2:42:59] <+JailShmixRemix> IT WAS THE PLAYER
[2:43:15] <cerazor01> So then It was Yakuza boy
[2:43:15] <bettysharkface> Yakuza was gonna meet with Mahiru and saw she was dead
[2:43:16] <Daxalog> Can the person who was killed count as knowing they died as they were being killed?
[2:43:17] <layZman> d2 is full of consistency jabs at d1
[2:43:21] <cerazor01> Like we said Last stream
[2:43:22] <tacostarvedbeast> Kazuhira Miller?
[2:43:22] <+MisterRockett> @SuperVaderMan I actually have no idea why he answers this way cause not including the killer would give the killer away.
[2:43:24] <CrimsonFox777> @JailShmixRemix Body announcement sounded before the player discovered the body.
[2:43:26] <+SWindleFeD> @bettysharkface I agree, because he was also being really aggressive, maybe to throw attention away from himself
[2:43:29] <bettysharkface> Remember he met with the others outside the diner and left
[2:44:05] <+JailShmixRemix> they'll bring it up when its important LUL
[2:44:08] <heartlesshealer> they're kids, they get to be stupid I guess
[2:44:08] <+not_crabby> LARGE
[2:44:08] <bettysharkface> It's why Yakuza suspected goblin, he probably saw her inside
[2:44:10] <layZman> hampsters!

[2:46:34] <xeros720> it's due to the difficulty settings

[2:46:47] <bettysharkface> Those bottles
[2:46:50] <xeros720> they'll actually reduce how many bullets are available on easier modes
[2:46:58] <xeros720> of course, for trophies and crap, you need to do it on max difficulty

[2:52:09] <MelBrooksKA> Evening Paige
[2:52:11] <+lemonsakee> nice
[2:52:11] <@PeachSaliva> Aw man
[2:52:12] <cerazor01> cmonBruh
[2:52:13] <Ozavic> Hello mustard queen
[2:52:18] <+lemonsakee> hey peach
[2:52:22] <@PeachSaliva> Eli laugh about doo doo again
[2:52:24] <%MajorCrasher> hey Paige
[2:52:32] <Ouimjuips> How know no water bottles?
[2:52:35] <@PeachSaliva> ahoy
[2:52:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> what about the container
[2:52:59] <Ouimjuips> ...no
[2:53:03] <heartlesshealer> ....
[2:53:04] <Johnmaddened> ???
[2:53:04] <$Rezca> uhh???
[2:53:05] <layZman> this whole game is a logical fallacy
[2:53:06] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:53:06] <bettysharkface> It's...not...
[2:53:08] <Phob05> what
[2:53:16] <Samex_Comex> They washed off in the toilet
[2:53:24] <duriannights> hi silly funny lady
[2:53:27] <cerazor01> FailFish
[2:53:28] <Ozavic> Canada water
[2:53:28] <kiwicoffin> ah you're right
[2:53:33] <+HawkGoggles2> You don't know what that word means, lady
[2:53:45] <Arancet> theyre just imagining it
[2:53:46] <Solokaldaka> mind pictures
[2:53:48] <+lemonsakee> its a giant hologram screen
[2:53:52] <CrimsonFox777> I like to imagine it's pictures that show up in their handbooks.
[2:53:52] <$Rezca> pretend there is a massive holoprojector in the middle of the room
[2:53:58] <kentrix11> They have like the tablets no?
[2:54:00] <xeros720> they kind of do a better job of making it clear that you papers and pictures in phoenix wright
[2:54:08] <layZman> they all have the same evidence on their phones
[2:54:19] <Phob05> Those water bottles couldnt have been filled with water, that's a fallacy?
[2:54:29] <layZman> that's weirdly one of the key aspects of the game, everyone has access to the same evidence once it's gathered
[2:54:35] <xeros720> of course, sometimes, that means phoenix wright also takes a giant inflatable balloon out of his pocket though
[2:54:55] <+polypolipauli> Hooray! I'm so happy to see you plague!

[2:56:40] <heartlesshealer> oh wait, were her glasses still on?
[2:56:41] <+HawkGoggles2> You were wet, you did it.
[2:56:49] <Ozavic> @BlueLunecy I'm as straight as a diamond studded rainbow, but even I agree
[2:57:11] <+JailShmixRemix> I wonder
[2:57:13] <Ouimjuips> "That's my wifu"
[2:57:14] <Daxalog> Hes the protagonist of his own game
[2:57:16] <theloganbrand> simp
[2:57:16] <+JailShmixRemix> maybe he loves her
[2:57:19] <%EyeFarted> EyeFarted subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! WFT is this game even?
[2:57:38] <filialpails> when there was only one set of footprints, that's when jesus committed the murder
[2:57:42] <silverira> he helped her
[2:57:43] <YakumoYomi> You mention this NOW?
[2:57:45] <silverira> yes
[2:57:46] <+MicCloud> I guess no one did it then
[2:57:47] <cerazor01> Yes
[2:57:50] <Ouimjuips> Has to be
[2:57:52] <cerazor01> I've been saying this for a while
[2:57:53] <Ozavic> Don't spoil chat
[2:57:54] <silverira> 3 people found the body right
[2:57:55] <layZman> :V
[2:57:58] <xeros720> with regards with what Nagito asked before
[2:58:00] <+JailShmixRemix> He's in love
[2:58:00] <xeros720> probably
[2:58:01] <Johnmaddened> :)
[2:58:03] <+HawkGoggles2> Is he a liar or a perv?
[2:58:05] <silverira> how is that a spoiler i never played
[2:58:09] <TheAntiNihilist> duh.
[2:58:11] <BigBanterCorbin> chat its a rhetorical question hes not actually asking you LUL
[2:58:11] <Teyaric> you're on A Track
[2:58:12] <SuperVaderMan> Wait, do accomplices get killed too, or not in this game's logic?
[2:58:22] <+JailShmixRemix> they get killed too
[2:58:22] <layZman> look there's a big screen
[2:58:29] <CrimsonFox777> @SuperVaderMan Accomplices die. Only the actual killer gets to live.
[2:58:31] <+JailShmixRemix> Everyone except for the killer dies
[2:58:39] <Dlent_> Don’t spoil that the real killer is chat :)
[2:58:41] <+JailShmixRemix> there is 0 reason to be an accomplice
[2:58:49] <Johnmaddened> we're two hours in it's TOO SOON
[2:58:49] <layZman> if you don't accurately deduce the killer everyone else dies
[2:58:50] <xeros720> yeah, iirc, only the killer gets to leave if they get away with it right? even if they have an accomplice
[2:59:01] <+lemonsakee> half these characters can probably pick up a car
[2:59:05] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 60 months! ooooo, more Dungeon Grandpas. destroy your classmates with facts and logic! also yay for 5 years of plague
[2:59:38] <TheAntiNihilist> clearly he is
[2:59:44] <YakumoYomi> Just punch him in the face
[2:59:53] <silverira> its the perfect crime
[2:59:57] <+JailShmixRemix> Guess I'll die
[3:00:07] <+SWindleFeD> I think mafia boy is made to be this way just so most of the evidence can be used
[3:00:41] <TheAntiNihilist> she climbed on the shoulders of her simp army
[3:00:48] <+JailShmixRemix> Only for big boys and girls
[3:00:57] <SuperVaderMan> This is like a two story bathroom
[3:00:58] <%Scarnehu> pat could never have helped her out of the window!
[3:01:01] <xeros720> aha, i never noticed how small that door i
[3:01:03] <heartlesshealer> those walls are so fucking high
[3:01:04] <Ouimjuips> but it's from the POV of a 2ft tall Japanese child
[3:01:17] <CursedNobleman> plague already married LUL
[3:01:20] <bettysharkface> [Borats in the distance]
[3:01:22] <GarbageNirvana> Mah waaief
[3:01:24] <%MajorCrasher> he can't have boosted her because then he'd have left footprints when he left himself
[3:01:29] <silverira> well cant you stand on the sink?
[3:01:29] <+Promessa_EX> so an anime character can just jump
[3:01:32] <YakumoYomi> She could have jumped off his shoulders?
[3:01:34] <+JailShmixRemix> yeah pretty much
[3:01:45] <+hrbeck_> Real 5’11 problems
[3:01:55] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:06] <+JailShmixRemix> a rope jphSad
[3:02:07] <SuperVaderMan> Use the manlet as a grappling hook
[3:02:14] <+Promessa_EX> she could do something silly like stand on her sword
[3:02:14] <Zebroneath> it's the only way!
[3:02:19] <BlacSoul> just walked in, i dont like boss baby character
[3:02:22] <CursedNobleman> like the utility baby in that trogdor adventure game
[3:02:33] <silverira> she used Kuz saggy balls as rope
[3:02:40] <+JailShmixRemix> She made the wetsuits into a grappling hook
[3:02:43] <+JailShmixRemix> OF COURSE
[3:02:53] <+twohitgood> why would you follow a school rule if you're going for murder?
[3:02:59] <layZman> YUP
[3:03:06] <layZman> get used to this
[3:03:12] <xeros720> i think that rule exists more so monokuma can just destroy evidence outside
[3:03:13] <CrimsonFox777> Littering is prohibited. Pat would be the first to die in this game because of that.
[3:03:18] <Dlent_> Just eat the rope
[3:03:24] <BaronVonThule> Get away with murder, arrested for littering FeelsBadMan
[3:03:31] <+JailShmixRemix> Hide it in your Pekos duh
[3:03:31] <+twohitgood> keister the rope?
[3:03:37] <+HawkGoggles2> "Man we really are dumb aren't we guys."

[3:03:53] <Samex_Comex> She let down her hair
[3:03:54] <xeros720> that 44 yr old child just can't stop
[3:04:05] <Teyaric> its Peko. what's her gimmick?
[3:04:06] <SuperVaderMan> Bend over Peko, we have to be sure

[3:08:54] <+YabbaTroll> you weren't looking at the sword I guess
[3:08:54] <Samex_Comex> I thought it was a sandel
[3:08:56] <Daxalog> Wont let you jerk it
[3:08:58] <grandchickenlord> This was always such a weird part of the game to me. Like I want to simulate solving a murder mystery and debating, not this weird space invader scrabble.
[3:08:59] <+JailShmixRemix> "A shinai (竹刀) is a Japanese sword typically made of bamboo used for practice and competition in kendo"

[3:19:02] <+teriyaki_drinker> Pout
[3:19:08] <grandchickenlord> It’s Japanese, it all comes back to “justice”. To be fair I think it’s a bit of a translation issue. Because “justice” has a more general meaning in Japanese.

[3:22:51] <Johnmaddened> :)
[3:22:51] <+derg0ns> SHUT UP
[3:22:51] <vladtet909> You have no idea what V3 has in store for you
[3:22:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> lol
[3:22:54] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[3:22:55] <MightyPsychoBat> There is a wigging out killer in the room and they have a comical scene...
[3:22:56] <DarkaiXeno> No
[3:22:57] <sosuke5> you
[3:22:58] <Teyaric> they twist on the concept hard actually
[3:22:59] <RadioRaptor> uh weeeeell
[3:23:00] <SirFancySwank> find out when you play
[3:23:04] <+thatdamncoyote> V3 is a study in contrasts
[3:23:08] <thealsian> Spoilers if I say?
[3:23:08] <+lemonsakee> by the way this series ends with a terrible anime called danganronpa 3
[3:23:09] <tukds> You have no idea how formulaic this series is
[3:23:14] <BaronVonThule> V3 is fun :)
[3:23:14] <+Promessa_EX> i mean she's only acting like this to hide her actual motive
[3:23:27] <layZman> v3 takes place after anime @lemonsakee
[3:23:30] <+Promessa_EX> if you don't care
[3:23:31] <layZman> I thought
[3:23:32] <+lemonsakee> yea
[3:23:37] <Johnmaddened> speaking of clocking out, v3's finale was that for me
[3:23:39] <+lemonsakee> but this story ends at 3
[3:23:44] <layZman> fair
[3:23:45] <bettysharkface> That...counts as being an accomplice...
[3:23:46] <+lemonsakee> v3 is an afterthought really
[3:23:57] <+twohitgood> covering up a murder is enabling a murder...that's pretty much murder, yes?
[3:23:58] <bevyrage> in the original text of the game instead of saying 'evil' they say 'criminals'
[3:24:02] <Teyaric> V3 is MGS2
[3:24:05] <layZman> i was confused as shit seeing v3's ending after the anime's ending like WHY WOULD THIS BE HAPPENING!?
[3:24:11] <%MajorCrasher> oh yeah I clocked out hard on v3's ending
[3:24:20] <+lemonsakee> i loved v3s ending
[3:24:28] <bettysharkface> Maybe she thinks the revenge is justified?
[3:24:29] <+SWindleFeD> Peko just keeps saying empty shit that doesn't really explain her motive
[3:24:31] <layZman> its good if you ignore anime's ending
[3:24:31] <+lemonsakee> I hate danganronpa 3
[3:24:41] <+lemonsakee> remember this was cooler in japanese
[3:24:42] <SuperVaderMan> JUSTICE JUSTICE JUSTICE
[3:24:43] <thealsian> V3 is Kodaka going "Yes this series is over go somewhere else please..."
[3:24:51] <terminusterminal> We've been in a cycle of her saying justice and a character reacting for a while now.
[3:24:59] <+teriyaki_drinker> Babi
[3:25:04] <YakumoYomi> "Just get to the goddamn point" is an issue I've had with a lot of JRPGs lately
[3:25:06] <+LaserCat006> is this undertale now?
[3:25:06] <+eyezehuhh> I love her outburts LUL
[3:25:07] <SuperVaderMan> Animeeeeee
[3:25:08] <bevyrage> retreading the same ground to drill trivial info into your head is the crux of the game. you're guaranteed to be clocked out
[3:25:14] <tukds> @layZman Why are you talking about the third games story at the second trial of the second game
[3:25:15] <+JailShmixRemix> HAHAHAHAHA
[3:25:21] <+eyezehuhh> next bit Peko
[3:25:26] <thealsian> Peko has a cute laugh.
[3:25:31] <layZman> because other people are?
[3:25:37] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:25:38] <CrimsonFox777> Time to make a comic book!
[3:25:40] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:25:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> SourPls
[3:25:45] <Teyaric> the funny thing is - your response is deliberately what she's going for
[3:25:49] <tukds> MAX NUT
[3:25:49] <+JailShmixRemix> love this song
[3:25:50] <Johnmaddened> SourPls
[3:25:50] <Puhff> "I hate (the) Japanese." - PlagueofGripes 2021
[3:25:50] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls
[3:26:03] <Johnmaddened> best minigame, best song
[3:26:28] <Dlent_> Why do they think it’s peko when it’s obviously that gray guy
[3:26:32] <GarbageNirvana> There's text at the top if you hover over these icons
[3:26:33] <+SWindleFeD> "Pretty"
[3:26:52] <xeros720> there being less choices helps a lot with doing it, but it's still pretty tedious
[3:26:52] <CrimsonFox777> HE SAID IT
[3:26:54] <Teyaric> @dlent_ Samurai / retainer tropes
[3:26:54] <Puhff> I love how everyone bleeds bubblegum in this universe.
[3:27:08] <+JailShmixRemix> gross plague
[3:27:15] <SirFancySwank> lemon booger
[3:27:19] <MightyPsychoBat> Wait a minute.. how is it Justice to frame someone else for the murder!!??
[3:27:30] <YakumoYomi> I guess that's a CERO thing (making the blood pink to avoid a higher rating)?
[3:27:31] <+MisterRockett> They don't really perfect these until V3.
[3:27:35] <+JailShmixRemix> btw, all the fake/duplicate images are taken from the existing potraits
[3:27:40] <+JailShmixRemix> if u didnt realize already
[3:27:54] <+Promessa_EX> look how cute chiaki is
[3:28:13] <xeros720> did the first one even have a selectable difficulty?
[3:28:17] <tukds> The timer isn't even necessary anymore
[3:28:20] <CrimsonFox777> Didn't the first game give you like 20 minutes for this?
[3:28:48] <Johnmaddened> Mahiru got slimed
[3:28:55] <grandchickenlord> Are there any good games that have like a simulate concept to this or ace attorney: debating mysteries with evidence.  But like, with actually good writing?
[3:29:17] <Teyaric> it's not possible to do so, sadly
[3:29:19] <%MajorCrasher> @grandchickenlord HAHA NO
[3:29:22] <layZman> spike chunsofts earlier Zero Escape series is amazing
[3:29:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> shitting on danganronpa is part of the fun
[3:29:29] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:29:34] <+JailShmixRemix> Lol
[3:29:36] <+lemonsakee> zero escape i hear is good
[3:29:37] <layZman> but its not murder mystery as much as survival horror time traveling reality bending drama
[3:29:39] <+lemonsakee> never played it before
[3:29:40] <+shaidot> zero escape is escape rooms tho
[3:29:42] <layZman> zero escape is amazing
[3:29:43] <Johnmaddened> SourPls
[3:29:47] <%MajorCrasher> if there was I wouldn't have played this entire series @grandchickenlord
[3:29:48] <+SWindleFeD> None of this explains the motive tho....
[3:29:48] <+JailShmixRemix> Zero Escape is not great
[3:29:52] <+Stunstark> Zero escape is great but less murder mystery
[3:29:53] <tukds> The only good thing about this series is the art
[3:29:54] <+zepelinnn1> zero escape also has a LOT of dumb shit
[3:29:56] <+teriyaki_drinker> SourPls jam time
[3:29:56] <+zepelinnn1> A LOT
[3:29:59] <+xerioes> zero escape begins good then gets fucking stupid
[3:30:01] <+zepelinnn1> and i like them
[3:30:02] <layZman> that's what makes it amazing
[3:30:04] <theloganbrand> Goichi Suda PogChamp PogChamp
[3:30:06] <+Promessa_EX> everything is bad nothing is good enjoying things is for losers
[3:30:08] <+shaidot> I think it's good but the plot is just ads dumb
[3:30:10] <Johnmaddened> Zero Time Dilemma LUL
[3:30:11] <layZman> it goes beyond stupidity and into astounding logic
[3:30:19] <+JailShmixRemix> if ur annoyed about the dumb shit in this game, you will also be annoyed about the dumb shit in Zero Escape
[3:30:19] <+lemonsakee> gray man...
[3:30:22] <layZman> last game especially
[3:30:23] <tukds> My motives are...complex...
[3:30:25] <+JailShmixRemix> 999 is the best in the series though
[3:30:27] <YakumoYomi> ゴゴゴゴゴ
[3:30:27] <layZman> is amazing
[3:30:33] <+JailShmixRemix> the first game
[3:30:36] <layZman> yeah first game is the best just like dangan
[3:30:41] <filialpails> angry about videol games? sounds like a motive for murder
[3:30:46] <YakumoYomi> Is that Smeagle？
[3:30:49] <+shaidot> VLR is good but it's really long and gets repetitive
[3:30:49] <+Promessa_EX> if you can't do a sudoku you won't like it
[3:30:50] <thealsian> @JailShmixRemix Is Zero Escape just as dumb?
[3:30:52] <layZman> spike chun seems unable to continue plot as sequels go on
[3:30:58] <SuperVaderMan> Grey-kun is such a scamp
[3:31:00] <%MajorCrasher> VLR is silly but still my favorite in the series
[3:31:04] <+doctor_piranha> Boy you're gonna HATE the third trial
[3:31:06] <layZman> zero escape is more dumb and less dumb
[3:31:15] <redial_nick> dammit gundamrompa
[3:31:15] <+thatdamncoyote> How often do these teenagers check their vacation mail?
[3:31:15] <layZman> all the puzzles make logical sense
[3:31:16] <+JailShmixRemix> @thealsian at times, worse, most of the dumb shit is saved for after the first game though
[3:31:21] <layZman> but the plot is absolutely batshit
[3:31:27] <kingra> Cute
[3:31:28] <+xiccy> Ace Attorney gets like this sometimes but barely. Makes it so much more tolerable.
[3:31:30] <+JailShmixRemix> the second game is fine, still has its dumb shit but the overall return is good
[3:31:32] <tukds> V3 is the best it just sucks that its last and highlights ho  repetitive it is
[3:31:35] <+xerioes> 999 was pretty sound until you get to whats actually goin on, then its just nonsense
[3:31:36] <+JailShmixRemix> the last game is...well
[3:31:38] <+JailShmixRemix> a game
[3:31:38] <CursedNobleman> does this smell like chloroform?
[3:31:39] <+Promessa_EX> all of these are cute
[3:31:41] <+shaidot> the plot to ZTD is hilarious
[3:31:44] <layZman> without spoiling, to beat the third game you have to completely randomly lose it at some time
[3:31:50] <bevyrage> chlorophorm is a thing though
[3:32:04] <+JailShmixRemix> 999 is easily the best in the series, and the least dumb shit, its a pretty solid singular story if u want to take it as such
[3:32:09] <SuperVaderMan> haha, logic
[3:32:09] <+teriyaki_drinker> How did she get it though
[3:32:12] <YakumoYomi> Chloroform takes multiple minutes to render someone unconscious
[3:32:15] <Johnmaddened> ZTD is so bad it becomes a comedy
[3:32:19] <layZman> 999 could easily be a singular story
[3:32:20] <bevyrage> not in anime logic
[3:32:23] <bettysharkface> A lot of this seems to rely on people being idiots
[3:32:25] <syanplague> I mean she thinks everyone else is stupid so
[3:32:26] <+thegamekirby98> How far is this in?
[3:32:29] <layZman> yeah 2-3 are so bad it's actually funny and amusing
[3:32:34] <bevyrage> not only does anime treat it like an uncontrolled substance but also as a super sedative
[3:32:38] <+shaidot> but its fun to watch, especially an LP
[3:32:39] <+JailShmixRemix> 2 has its upsides
[3:32:40] <CursedNobleman> tiny baby boy cannot life a bat.
[3:32:46] <tukds> @layZman this is the second game...
[3:32:49] <CrimsonFox777> BONK
[3:32:53] <The_marinader> B O N K
[3:32:56] <Daxalog> Why would the ultimate swordsman use a metal bat and not a sword?
[3:32:56] <layZman> @tukds zero escape not this
[3:33:07] <CursedNobleman> 'this iz ze scout. rainbows make me cry. Over!'
[3:33:19] <tukds> @layZman oh sorry
[3:33:22] <Teyaric> Ken do strike - suitable for blunt or edged
[3:33:32] <tukds> Planned?
[3:33:33] <xeros720> and they called everyone over for a beach party, so she'd have to run into the party!
[3:33:34] <+HawkGoggles2> Got to gamify my murder
[3:33:40] <cerazor01> WutFace
[3:33:47] <Johnmaddened> :)
[3:33:48] <BakaSurvivah> their built different
[3:33:56] <grandchickenlord> “This is so convoluted” welcome to danganronpa
[3:33:58] <tukds> If this game didn't have this art it would be irrideemable
[3:34:01] <Solokaldaka> no one cared who she was until she put on the mask
[3:34:01] <+derg0ns> super market
[3:34:03] <layZman> such a good idea to leave a calling card if you want to go undiscovered
[3:34:09] <$Rezca> doesn't this cout as littering?
[3:34:11] <+Onionchamp> Haven’t you come up with an elaborate murder with multiple pieces of set up during your morning shower
[3:34:14] <+MisterRockett> Convivence store most likely.
[3:34:18] <+AlvinTheLiar> has multiple copies too
[3:34:19] <+twohitgood> if you're gonna be a serial killer with a calling card, you'll have extras on hand. never know when you might need to kill soemone.
[3:34:21] <xeros720> yeah, it's an examinable earlier like derg0ns said
[3:34:22] <Shadope342> an OMMM of anger
[3:34:24] <+doctor_piranha> @tukds Music is dope too though
[3:34:32] <Sapphire_Breeze> yeah isn't this littering
[3:34:45] <bettysharkface> Justice
[3:34:46] <YakumoYomi> @Onionchamp Of course not! I need to be on the can to do that kind of thinking.
[3:34:52] <CursedNobleman> SPLOOSH.
[3:34:53] <Phob05> If she just cares about killing for justice why did she try to frame gremlin woman?
[3:34:58] <xeros720> they were properly disposed in a trashcan
[3:35:00] <+eyezehuhh> !discord
[3:35:05] <layZman> all the murder plots seem rushed because almost all of them are murders of convenience structured around monokuma's meddling of the day
[3:35:12] <+eyezehuhh> worth a shot
[3:35:14] <funwashere> dont ask reasonable questions just accept it as truth
[3:35:18] <The_marinader> Oh man
[3:35:20] <layZman> also bad writing
[3:35:22] <funwashere> LUL
[3:35:24] <+MaxeusTheFirst> Cold shower
[3:35:31] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:35:32] <+derg0ns> tropical heat made it all evaporate
[3:35:34] <Samex_Comex> :(
[3:35:41] <+Promessa_EX> @Phob05 to make the case more difficult to teach mafia boy how to survive trials
[3:35:48] <+hrbeck_> Why didn’t peko just use her diamond-like nipples to cut a hole through the wall?
[3:35:50] <+eyezehuhh> LUL
[3:35:53] <Johnmaddened> who needs a million channels anyway
[3:35:59] <+not_crabby> the BASTARDS
[3:36:04] <tukds> Make it STOP, just end it already
[3:36:14] <+not_crabby> no please dont add more channels
[3:36:27] <+Promessa_EX> no she had to leave the gummy bear
[3:36:28] <+YabbaTroll> to hide the gummi
[3:36:30] <layZman> but the gummi bear
[3:36:31] <CrimsonFox777> Gotta plant that evidence
[3:36:35] <layZman> the all important planted evidence
[3:36:42] <+heavenlygunner> Leaving is far to small minded. Big brained thought processing is hiding in the room.
[3:36:48] <+Promessa_EX> hiyoko likes gummy bears
[3:36:50] <+YabbaTroll> hiyoko would have sniffed them out
[3:36:52] <heartlesshealer> THEY HAD TO FEEL SMART
[3:36:57] <YakumoYomi> "Ooo! Piece of candy!"
[3:36:59] <+AlvinTheLiar> She'd smell them
[3:36:59] <tukds> She would have eaten them
[3:37:01] <+HawkGoggles2> I'm surprised they were still dripping wet after getting out of the bad.
[3:37:02] <SuperVaderMan> Hiyoko would've just gobbled all the gummis like an animal
[3:37:06] <Sapphire_Breeze> isn't leaving gummi bears littering?
[3:37:07] <SuperVaderMan> like a horrid goblin
[3:37:10] <CursedNobleman> let me oooout! let me ouuuuuuuut!
[3:37:12] <Samex_Comex> Would the gummy bear be littering?
[3:37:21] <+MaxeusTheFirst> They wanted the movement of the body to frame the Pig Tail.
[3:37:25] <thealsian> That look of fear is intense...
[3:37:28] <Johnmaddened> BURST
[3:37:29] <heartlesshealer> oh no, she's using her burst attack
[3:37:33] <CursedNobleman> @thealsian oh yeah, thats legit.
[3:37:42] <tukds> AAAAAHHH
[3:37:44] <+JailShmixRemix> PogChamp she used her burst now shes gonna die
[3:37:49] <Phob05> Gremlin girl couldnt just told the truth and the gummy plan wouldve been worthless
[3:37:53] <+YabbaTroll> HMPH
[3:37:53] <terminusterminal> That fucking gummi bear
[3:37:54] <SuperVaderMan> So how did Peko leave without leaving footprints
[3:37:57] <layZman> gysh
[3:38:00] <+YabbaTroll> GYSH
[3:38:01] <+Promessa_EX> and she got the gummy bear wrong
[3:38:02] <tukds> laughing out loud
[3:38:02] <Ouimjuips> Gysh
[3:38:02] <layZman> that's a sound I've never heard
[3:38:05] <+heavenlygunner> ONE gummy bear can kill a man
[3:38:06] <Johnmaddened> gysh
[3:38:08] <YakumoYomi> GYSH
[3:38:10] <Dlent_> That’s the gummy sound effect
[3:38:14] <SuperVaderMan> oh yeah the window
[3:38:19] <+YabbaTroll> MM OMB?
[3:38:20] <%MajorCrasher> @supervaderman through the shower window. it leads out onto grass
[3:38:21] <+hrbeck_> Stupid like a fox
[3:38:23] <+Reaper_Hunter> This is a game about alien-robot-deman teddy bears that took over the world kidnapping children who are famous for being good at 1 thing. Logic takes a huge back seat-here.
[3:38:25] <+heavenlygunner> That gummy is very meancing.
[3:38:30] <CalderGaming> Get Your SHinebox
[3:38:30] <+JailShmixRemix> I can do this :)
[3:38:31] <CursedNobleman> MM OMM
[3:38:36] <CalderGaming> YUP
[3:38:37] <tukds> "Turn your brain off bro"
[3:38:41] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:38:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> yes
[3:38:46] <+Onionchamp> There’s such a huge amount of padding in these cases when you look at it more than the bare minimum
[3:38:46] <Johnmaddened> YEAP LUL
[3:38:49] <CursedNobleman> 'this case is so stupid.' you aint seen nothing yet plague LUL
[3:38:50] <BaronVonThule> Yes
[3:38:57] <Sloavon> JUSTICE
[3:38:57] <TheAntiNihilist> it only gets worse
[3:38:59] <SirFancySwank> the next one is even dumber
[3:39:09] <+shaidot> Game is telling you to stfu
[3:39:09] <vladtet909> I assure you, they get dumber
[3:39:10] <layZman> 100% of the time in attempts to conceal their identity they end up convoluting what would be an unsolvable murder without forensic science
[3:39:11] <$JobbedBone> but they panicked in the moment bro, murder is stressful
[3:39:18] <+JailShmixRemix> I can do this PogChamp
[3:39:28] <+heavenlygunner> Okay now that is very stupid
[3:39:30] <Samex_Comex> Could have also put blood on her shoes
[3:39:31] <YakumoYomi> Fwoosh! DA-DU!
[3:39:32] <layZman> like just beat someone to death
[3:39:37] <heartlesshealer> that doesn't work
[3:39:39] <layZman> how can they prove WHO did it?
[3:39:40] <filialpails> volumptuous?
[3:39:42] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[3:39:43] <+Promessa_EX> look how cute
[3:39:45] <DarkaiXeno> I mean you really think people will come up with perfect scenario murders 100% of the time in real life?
[3:39:50] <+Promessa_EX> chiaki cute
[3:39:52] <+Reaper_Hunter> Just wait for the cases that only bring evidence DURING the trial to that they can pull anything out here ass.
[3:39:55] <heartlesshealer> use something you're holding as a step-stool?!
[3:39:57] <Sloavon> Booba Justice
[3:39:59] <+MisterRockett> @layZman There's one in V3 where the killer would have objectively gotten away with it super cleanly if they hadn't done literally everything they did after murdering the person.
[3:40:02] <+JailShmixRemix> The skirt dealy?
[3:40:05] <tukds> nah
[3:40:07] <+lemonsakee> nanamis nanamis...
[3:40:09] <syanplague> those are cute
[3:40:09] <Phob05> "The killer also only weighs about 5 pounds so the sword didn't break when a human being stood on it!"
[3:40:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> yeah
[3:40:12] <+alphonseisbest> ew
[3:40:20] <+heavenlygunner> so a expert in the matter huh plague?
[3:40:21] <+JailShmixRemix> but you are leering?
[3:40:22] <bettysharkface> Oh geez
[3:40:24] <KainZero0> yet
[3:40:26] <+HawkGoggles2> Didn't dry right away, spend a while in a bag.
[3:40:27] <bevyrage> you're not 40 but you ARE leering
[3:40:28] <+derg0ns> dressed in a spyro costume
[3:40:28] <layZman> i know it makes no sense they all literally overthink the situation
[3:40:32] <Johnmaddened> @misterrockett SEESAW
[3:40:34] <YakumoYomi> You don't deny the leering, though
[3:40:38] <+doctor_piranha> BONK
[3:40:39] <CrimsonFox777> Peko Peko
[3:40:43] <thealsian> Honestly the bullshit needed to make the games work is the simple fact that without forensic equipment, there's no real reason for someone to do anything than just kill someone and run without anyone noticing.
[3:40:53] <grandchickenlord> Plague has been 40 years old since he was born
[3:40:57] <bevyrage> hey wait is this the reason why that rabbit vtuber peko has the pigtail design and overall crazy attitude?
[3:40:59] <TheAntiNihilist> foiled if she just said lol no
[3:40:59] <layZman> just drown a fucker
[3:41:01] <tukds> PSP game

[3:41:52] <%MajorCrasher> I think the fact that this game has a character named Peko Pekoyama should tell you that none of this is meant to be taken seriously
[3:41:53] <tukds> More padding
[3:42:03] <YakumoYomi> @bevyrage It's possible, but I think Pekora herself has said she's crazy on stream because she's really shy IRL

[3:49:42] <+YabbaTroll> its kinda wack
[3:49:44] <+MisterRockett> The timeline will become INCREDIBLY clear by the end of the game.
[3:49:45] <filialpails> big hmmm
[3:49:46] <+JailShmixRemix> Peko originated from the spanish language
[3:49:50] <+lemonsakee> they made it jack for no reason
[3:49:51] <tukds> Genocide Jack was killing before the tragedy
[3:49:52] <%MajorCrasher> idk what does fat byakuya tell you about the first game?
[3:49:53] <+shaidot> its explained
[3:50:00] <Johnmaddened> oh you'll know eventually
[3:50:00] <tattleworm> hmm!
[3:50:04] <+lemonsakee> genocider was a killer before danganronpa 1
[3:50:09] <Maids4lyfe> they wanted to make it sound like jack the ripper
[3:50:09] <heavenlygunner> Best girl Chiaki!
[3:50:12] <+MisterRockett> @tukds Yes but her gender was unknown.
[3:50:16] <kentrix11> IDK if Jack was confiermed to be a woman before 1 though.
[3:50:16] <+JailShmixRemix> No
[3:50:17] <DarkaiXeno> No there was a book about genocide jack in the 1st danganronpa as well to
[3:50:22] <syanplague> I mean Genocide Jack was murdering people way before

[3:50:25] <Ouimjuips> Donde esta la bibliotecha
[3:50:27] <bevyrage> while genocide jack was killing before the tragedy, the first game is the only point where we get public information that she was a woman

[3:50:27] <Johnmaddened> based Chiaki

[4:00:50] <Sloavon> heyzeusFine that's a nice plan you got there.
[4:01:01] <BlueLunecy> I'm sure there's something in there
[4:01:07] <YakumoYomi> It's mostly because they don't bring criminals to try unless they're SURE they can get a conviction
[4:01:07] <+xiccy> Boy am I glad I didn't decide to play this. Cause this nonsense would've driven me crazy.
[4:01:10] <+shaidot> isn't the US conviction rate over 90% also?
[4:01:10] <MightyPsychoBat> Legal Eagle did videos about that
[4:01:10] <silverira> I'm so tired of this japanese bs
[4:01:15] <+lemonsakee> kodaka mostly just wants to make fun of anime and do epic references
[4:01:15] <tukds> The writer is an idiot it only shows with each passing game especially in the anime
[4:01:15] <YakumoYomi> Trial, rather.
[4:01:32] <BlueLunecy> 🅱️
[4:01:32] <+crowmium> Is Monokuma still *her* in this?
[4:01:40] <+JailShmixRemix> we dont know
[4:01:43] <bettysharkface> Eeeeeergghhhhh
[4:01:56] <BlueLunecy> He's a bear
[4:01:56] <@PeachSaliva> Who is this bear
[4:01:56] <+lemonsakee> monokuma is me
[4:01:56] <layZman> a bear
[4:01:59] <+not_crabby> b for BITCH
[4:02:00] <SuperVaderMan> It's Monokuma literally just Jigsaw?
[4:02:01] <+crowmium> Which makes no fucking sense
[4:02:01] <thealsian> That's spoilers
[4:02:02] <heavenlygunner> He is clearly a Gummy Bear Plague
[4:02:06] <+not_crabby> Kappa
[4:02:06] <DarkaiXeno> Monokuma is whatever you want it to be, baby
[4:02:06] <+JailShmixRemix> Plague is monokuma
[4:02:12] <Johnmaddened> monokuma is monokuma
[4:02:12] <+Promessa_EX> he's amogus
[4:02:12] <CalderGaming> he's amogus
[4:02:14] <+teriyaki_drinker> B for gettin bitches lytJACKPOT
[4:02:15] <@PeachSaliva> Eli is a bear
[4:02:20] <Maids4lyfe> he's 10 jars of mayo
[4:02:20] <YakumoYomi> Gummy Bear Plague?!
[4:02:21] <CalderGaming> @Promessa_EX LMAO
[4:02:23] <+crowmium> monokuma is just the personification of human evil tbh
[4:02:24] <%MajorCrasher> Monokuma is an idea and philosophy
[4:02:26] <+xiccy> The real Monokuma was in us all along
[4:02:29] <bettysharkface> Eli is a grumpy cat
[4:02:37] <bettysharkface> Or a sleepy owl
[4:02:57] <terminusterminal> You are a tool, but for unrelated reasons.
[4:02:58] <wolfen091> I prefer the creepy spyro myself @bettysharkface
[4:02:58] <bevyrage> this series is just sweaty internet arguments
[4:03:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> Alien?
[4:03:06] <+JailShmixRemix> Good point
[4:03:11] <CalderGaming> but the PLANE... on the TREADMILL
[4:03:13] <grandchickenlord> No, you’re both
[4:03:14] <+ratchetex> I only killed them because someone told me to, I did nothing wrong
[4:03:16] <ammobasket> Send that piano to the electric chair!
[4:03:18] <+twohitgood> no voting for the metal bat
[4:03:22] <silverira> if she was a tool she was discarded
[4:03:22] <Johnmaddened> Peko is acting like a tool right now
[4:03:24] <bettysharkface> It's the guns don't kill people argument but stupid
[4:03:26] <ducellion> just kill her already oh my god game
[4:03:27] <grandchickenlord> You’re human, but I can guarantee your an absolute tool
[4:03:31] <Solokaldaka> true HahaThink
[4:03:33] <heavenlygunner> I always hated this conversation.
[4:03:36] <RadioRaptor> a people Kappa
[4:03:39] <+ratchetex> I couldn't have not killed them, they asked me nicely
[4:03:43] <YakumoYomi> @bevyrage What'd you just say, you bastard?! I'LL KILL YOU!
[4:04:09] <layZman> :V
[4:04:10] <+JailShmixRemix> Baby sword
[4:04:10] <+ratchetex> oh fuck you

[4:04:14] <BlueLunecy> Baby knife
[4:04:14] <silverira> FUCK THIS
[4:04:15] <Dlent_> Make sure to take note of the baby with a sword.
[4:04:16] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[4:04:18] <+JailShmixRemix> Man I love that image
[4:04:19] <CalderGaming> like a Yakuza game, we get a sob story
[4:04:21] <heartlesshealer> baby tanto
[4:04:23] <YakumoYomi> Wait...is Peko just Haku (from Naruto)?
[4:04:23] <SuperVaderMan> Baby with a baby sword
[4:04:25] <+JailShmixRemix> ITS SO GOOD
[4:04:26] <heavenlygunner> Baby sword
[4:04:27] <Johnmaddened> actual boss baby
[4:04:28] <SirFancySwank> this series has really bad baby art
[4:04:28] <+HawkGoggles2> We aren't childhood friends, together for ever.

[4:04:39] <+JailShmixRemix> ITS SO GOOD
[4:04:40] <RadioRaptor> SeemsGood
[4:04:42] <Samex_Comex> She was born with it
[4:04:42] <+SWindleFeD> This sooo fucking dumb, I actually can't
[4:04:44] <Srthunda> love this game
[4:04:44] <Maids4lyfe> MASTERED THE BLADE AT 2 MONTHS OLD
[4:04:46] <TheAntiNihilist> so good
[4:04:48] <Shadope342> babby odachi
[4:04:49] <bevyrage> she's got the wakazashi in the top left image
[4:04:53] <omenesia> yeah, should have started with a gun for the baby
[4:04:55] <+JailShmixRemix> I was a master of the blade at 1
[4:04:56] <+ratchetex> I mean you didn't have to
[4:04:58] <JohnClaggart> weren't their memories wiped though?
[4:04:58] <%EyeFarted> BABY WITH A SWORD mader me laugh hard
[4:04:59] <heavenlygunner> What kind of baby needed another baby with a knife to protect a baby.
[4:05:00] <MightyPsychoBat> I was born by the sword... I was molded by it
[4:05:01] <Andele1503> she isnt a tool, she is a shitstain
[4:05:02] <+crowmium> This is why I never played #2 or 3
[4:05:02] <%MajorCrasher> I love how dumb these games are LUL
[4:05:04] <silverira> JAPAN
[4:05:05] <thealsian> Plague she needs to bond with it to  make her powerful with the sword yknow.
[4:05:06] <Ouimjuips> Do the Japanese not understand metaphors?
[4:05:08] <bettysharkface> I'm angry
[4:05:11] <RadioRaptor> LUL
[4:05:13] <Samex_Comex> When can we date again?
[4:05:14] <$JobbedBone> they just told the artist "make 500 scenes we'll pick which ones to use for what"
[4:05:14] <Sloavon> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[4:05:15] <KainZero0> LUL
[4:05:18] <silverira> ughhhhhhhh
[4:05:20] <Ouimjuips> C U M
[4:05:22] <+ratchetex> abuse is a bitch but you could have run away...
[4:05:24] <@PeachSaliva> Golly!!!
[4:05:25] <Johnmaddened> vineNut vineNut vineNut
[4:05:26] <+HawkGoggles2> Oh man, just great writing by giving me information I could have never know. So clever.
[4:05:27] <terminusterminal> I'm gonna coom.
[4:05:40] <tacostarvedbeast> I’m glad your enjoying the story :)
[4:05:53] <layZman> imagine the waste of pursuing her and then hearing she was only under orders
[4:06:01] <bevyrage> wait didn't their memories get wiped
[4:06:06] <SuperVaderMan> tool tool tool
[4:06:10] <bettysharkface> Please just die already
[4:06:10] <bevyrage> how... how do we have a childhood backstory
[4:06:14] <Johnmaddened> yeah this is... not super great looking back.
[4:06:14] <$JobbedBone> I wonder if anyone has ever made this UI in rainmeter
[4:06:17] <+JailShmixRemix> Rude
[4:06:18] <+ratchetex> she is a tool, but not in the way she thinks
[4:06:20] <layZman> you know what peko's favorite band is? Tool
[4:06:21] <CalderGaming> @bevyrage just the school memories
[4:06:21] <Ouimjuips> Worm food
[4:06:28] <bevyrage> ah okay
[4:06:45] <CrimsonFox777> you
[4:06:56] <heavenlygunner> 3 hour case to figure out why can't I remember what was taken from me.
[4:06:59] <silverira> they did the memory thing again? they do that in all games?
[4:07:14] <+JailShmixRemix> pretty much
[4:07:30] <+genowyn> Yea
[4:07:32] <+crowmium> That's how this series goes
[4:07:39] <thealsian> Sorta in V3, but not really at the same time.
[4:07:51] <+JailShmixRemix> thats pretty much how 1 was too, atleast to a degree
[4:07:52] <SuperVaderMan> palpatine-level foresight and planning LUL
[4:07:57] <+crowmium> Monokuma is apparently the world's greatest master of psychological manipulation
[4:07:58] <heavenlygunner> Dangan might as well be gaslighting the game.
[4:08:29] <bevyrage> it's on par with most detective stories
[4:08:30] <%MajorCrasher> this is the first time that scene was shown
[4:08:34] <$JobbedBone> what does his hair feel like
[4:08:39] <bevyrage> revealing information that the reader didn't get
[4:09:10] <bettysharkface> Yeaaah...I don't think I need to see any more of this game. It's...just dumb...
[4:09:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:09:27] <bevyrage> yeah it's like 'they speak of eye for an eye but one must learn to turn the other cheek'
[4:09:29] <TheAntiNihilist> eye for an eye is muslim actually...
[4:09:32] <+ratchetex> people do like to do that
[4:09:35] <+HawkGoggles2> You don't have to read the whole bible. you don't even have to read the whole verse.
[4:09:37] <Yuroshi> people taking bible versus out of context?
[4:09:39] <+SinisterBroccoli> doesn't it literally say like an eye for an eye leaves the world blind or something?
[4:09:45] <Yuroshi> never heard of that befor
[4:09:48] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:09:53] <grandchickenlord> Good old j dog specifally  says “turn the other cheek”
[4:09:55] <+teriyaki_drinker> Just dont rely on bible quotes
[4:09:57] <heavenlygunner> Pottery is a killable offense.
[4:10:04] <+JailShmixRemix> Yes
[4:10:08] <Maids4lyfe> it means revenge is stupid and don't do it
[4:10:08] <+shaidot> key aspect of being religious is cherry-picking context
[4:10:42] <Sloavon> heyzeusFine imagine reading a book to figure out how to be normal
[4:10:55] <heavenlygunner> SWATing at its finest.
[4:10:57] <Ouimjuips> I N C E L
[4:11:00] <+JailShmixRemix> i mean, he is a bitch
[4:11:05] <silverira> heh people died for less I guess
[4:11:07] <TheAntiNihilist> sounds legit
[4:11:24] <Johnmaddened> I guess videogames really do cause violence
[4:11:39] <$JobbedBone> tarentino character looking mf
[4:11:39] <bevyrage> 'got any proof?' 'bastard' 'you bastard' 'got any proof?' 'got any proof?'
[4:11:42] <Ouimjuips> I ordered the hitman, but didn't actually want to go through with it
[4:11:56] <Maids4lyfe> he got so mad he shat his diaper clean off
[4:11:57] <terminusterminal> Mahiru waited there the whole time for peko to show up?
[4:12:06] <+HawkGoggles2> I was gonna home run her face in, but I called in a pinch hitter.
[4:12:09] <+Promessa_EX> yes yes, and she's lying because she took the bat and did it voluntarily
[4:12:12] <+JailShmixRemix> hot
[4:12:16] <$JobbedBone> Kreygasm
[4:12:19] <+lemonsakee> whys he smiling lmao
[4:12:27] <Futurecity10> This game kinda sucks
[4:12:32] <Ouimjuips> Did he make her strip too?
[4:12:33] <+JailShmixRemix> oh 100%
[4:12:36] <+teriyaki_drinker> Hot
[4:12:51] <+crowmium> calling it now, Monokuma is going to say that the boy still killed her because she was a tool
[4:12:55] <bevyrage> you're also reading a story that's written by a heavily depressed nihilist
[4:12:55] <+Promessa_EX> the black and white cookie
[4:12:56] <Shadope342> ass
[4:13:00] <+lemonsakee> hes sexy
[4:13:01] <Ouimjuips> ass
[4:13:02] <silverira> piece of candy
[4:13:03] <+JailShmixRemix> the games not great, but I can enjoy stupidity every once and a while
[4:13:03] <bevyrage> peeps?
[4:13:04] <%MajorCrasher> delicious??
[4:13:04] <Johnmaddened> booty
[4:13:05] <heartlesshealer> peeps?
[4:13:05] <+shaidot> licorice?
[4:13:05] <Samex_Comex> Peeps
[4:13:05] <theloganbrand> peeps
[4:13:05] <JohnClaggart> peeps
[4:13:06] <bevyrage> peeps
[4:13:06] <CalderGaming> danganNOMpa
[4:13:10] <heavenlygunner> Peeping
[4:13:10] <Ouimjuips> Peeps
[4:13:12] <Maids4lyfe> peeps
[4:13:13] <MightyPsychoBat> He looks like a smore
[4:13:14] <$JobbedBone> why do half the girls in this series look chipmunks?
[4:13:16] <heartlesshealer> yes marshmallow and sugar
[4:13:21] <panic_rabbit> marshmallow peeps
[4:13:28] <Samex_Comex> Looks like half a oreo
[4:13:28] <CursedNobleman> peeps are disgusting
[4:13:31] <Futurecity10> Never had a peep, they look disgusting
[4:13:33] <$JobbedBone> look like*
[4:13:35] <+HawkGoggles2> There for five hours, still soaking wet.
[4:13:38] <Phob05> right
[4:13:39] <SuperVaderMan> So did Peko lift the manlet up through the window too
[4:13:45] <+lemonsakee> they dont
[4:13:56] <ammobasket> The Secret Spaniard!
[4:13:56] <bevyrage> sparkling justice is referenced in ultra despair girls
[4:13:57] <+shaidot> danganronpa gets really weird after this one
[4:13:58] <Jakerham_Lincoln> MARSHMALLOW PEEPS
[4:14:02] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[4:14:03] <sosuke5> Justice will sparkle on!
[4:14:03] <CursedNobleman> por que no los dos?
[4:14:07] <Johnmaddened> aw man if only
[4:14:10] <bettysharkface> Skip skip skip skip
[4:14:11] <Phob05> like, she WAS the killer and she wanted them to think she was
[4:14:12] <+lemonsakee> the next in the series is the terrible anime series not v3
[4:14:19] <+JailShmixRemix> No
[4:14:22] <$JobbedBone> the rules were vague so we'll allow it LUL
[4:14:29] <+shaidot> the anime ending is hilarious
[4:14:33] <layZman> v3 is literally not connected to the rest of the series
[4:14:37] <+crowmium> The point is Monokuma wants to have fun and this would be *less* fun
[4:14:38] <layZman> its almost stand alone
[4:14:41] <JohnClaggart> wait, but then they all die either way
[4:14:46] <CursedNobleman> i mean, if i was a douche, id let them make that argument then shank em
[4:14:47] <+shaidot> (kinda)
[4:14:47] <+Promessa_EX> well that would mean that fuyuhiko wins
[4:15:04] <CursedNobleman> STRANDING.
[4:15:05] <fran031> hopeism
[4:15:05] <+JailShmixRemix> Eastern writing?
[4:15:06] <+Promessa_EX> everyone else would die, always a possible outcome in games logic
[4:15:07] <sosuke5> waffle?
[4:15:09] <bevyrage> droning is a good term for it
[4:15:11] <+lemonsakee> waffling
[4:15:13] <bettysharkface> Compulsive wank?
[4:15:21] <+HawkGoggles2> Must dispose of the killer and their tool, no littering, right? That's a guess
[4:15:23] <$JobbedBone> so monokuma is like John Saw, but you can reason with him?
[4:15:26] <+Onionchamp> Padding?
[4:15:26] <+JailShmixRemix> HOPE
[4:15:31] <SuperVaderMan> ResidentSleeper
[4:15:33] <Johnmaddened> KIBOU
[4:15:35] <Ouimjuips> Another hour of arguing over who the killer Really is
[4:15:39] <thealsian> Nagito getting erect again over HOPE
[4:15:41] <+Pixel_Matt> This case is literally a battle to play to the judge
[4:15:41] <KgKid51> LUL LUL
[4:15:43] <Samex_Comex> Drag on grampa telling us about tieing a onion to his belt
[4:15:55] <JohnClaggart> tools do need to shit, plague
[4:15:56] <bevyrage> tools don't have hope so proving you have hope means you're not a tool
[4:15:57] <%MajorCrasher> LUL LUL
[4:15:58] <+teriyaki_drinker> lytBODIED uuuuugh JUST KILL HER
[4:15:59] <Shadope342> LUL
[4:16:02] <layZman> this whole game revolves around shitting at some point or another
[4:16:04] <SuperVaderMan> Tools don't clog toilets!
[4:16:06] <+JailShmixRemix> Tools need maintenance
[4:16:09] <BlueLunecy> Seeing a theme here tonight
[4:16:13] <LVL1_Scumbag> I mean, chainsaws have exhaust
[4:16:37] <+hrbeck_> Tools can fart, they cannot shit
[4:16:39] <JohnClaggart> it's been like 7 hours
[4:16:44] <+crowmium> I do really hate how little Danganronpa has for the player.
[4:16:44] <JohnClaggart> for this one chapter
[4:16:45] <SuperVaderMan> Drag-ass-ronpa
[4:16:49] <Phob05> I HAVE to assume this plays differently in Japanese because I cant believe a person wrote this
[4:16:50] <bettysharkface> !uptime
[4:16:51] <@Nightbot> 4 hours 17 minutes 2 seconds
[4:16:57] <+crowmium> It feels the need to tell us things again we just learned less than an hour ago
[4:17:02] <$JobbedBone> if you replace every tool from a murder gradually until none of the original tools are left, is it the same murder?
[4:17:05] <+JailShmixRemix> yeah
[4:17:09] <+JailShmixRemix> hes a little bitch
[4:17:24] <thealsian> Like Byakuya?
[4:17:26] <SirFancySwank> this game is known for having a bad localization
[4:17:42] <Samex_Comex> We are both tools
[4:17:49] <bevyrage> the bad localization only adds to the bad writing
[4:18:05] <Ouimjuips> It's not worth the braincells
[4:18:08] <bevyrage> the games aren't even well liked in japan either btw
[4:18:09] <bettysharkface> Wank...it's just wanking
[4:18:10] <Johnmaddened> lotta repeating
[4:18:13] <TheAntiNihilist> one killer still
[4:18:14] <+ratchetex> if she is a tool isn't she just an extension of him meaning they are both guilty and voting for her is voting for him?
[4:18:16] <ducellion> wat
[4:18:24] <+JailShmixRemix> pretty much
[4:18:28] <+twohitgood> he's charles manson
[4:18:32] <bevyrage> he was smiling last time
[4:18:38] <+JailShmixRemix> it did
[4:18:40] <CalderGaming> yes
[4:18:40] <Ouimjuips> yup
[4:18:40] <+crowmium> yes
[4:18:42] <+twohitgood> charles manson never actually killed someone himself but planned and prompted others to kill fo rhim.
[4:18:43] <+zepelinnn1> it was fake
[4:18:45] <YakumoYomi> Yes
[4:18:45] <$JobbedBone> what if murder had dumb bureaucracy LUL
[4:18:46] <+shaidot> her persepctive vs his
[4:18:58] <SirFancySwank> she lied about how he reacted originally
[4:19:22] <thealsian> She almost Mondo'd him.
[4:19:23] <SuperVaderMan> Shouldn't Monokuma just like... pick the option he thinks is the most fun? Because he's a psycho like that? So he could easily continue the game by making an arbitrary ruling, just kill them both
[4:19:25] <TheHauntedTank> would a hit-man be considered a tool?
[4:19:33] <+MisterRockett> Characters in this serious can come up with complex schemes quickly.
[4:19:38] <+MisterRockett> series*
[4:19:44] <%MajorCrasher> He planned the murder, but she also knew about it
[4:19:46] <+Promessa_EX> the preperation was just to get mahiru here for this confrontation about fuyuhikos sister
[4:19:56] <+zepelinnn1> ok blade wolf
[4:20:01] <Johnmaddened> the rumor come out, does fuyohiko is gay?
[4:20:02] <sosuke5> Kuzco's tool
[4:20:02] <heavenlygunner> Apparently this tool doesn't follow order and acts on her own.
[4:20:04] <tukds> anime
[4:20:07] <bevyrage> tool for a tool
[4:20:08] <terminusterminal> Perhaps we can get a thesaurus and find a couple other synonyms  for tool.
[4:20:11] <supergoblinpunch> sweet
[4:20:11] <+MisterRockett> Could she get me a girlfriend?
[4:20:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> yes pls
[4:20:14] <YakumoYomi> That's the American dream, isn't it?

[4:20:35] <ducellion> tfw no tool gf Kreygasm
[4:20:36] <Phob05> This is my waifu, there are many like it but this one is mine!
[4:20:37] <syanplague> I would just look her in the eye and say "you are sick, get some help"
[4:20:38] <tanarath> Why even kill anyone?
[4:20:39] <heartlesshealer> I'd rather have a guy who would cuddle and be willing to help me learn how to cook
[4:20:44] <Ouimjuips> Tool's come up with plans?
[4:20:51] <SuperVaderMan> Weren't the water bottles in the shower prior to the murder
[4:21:02] <+Onionchamp> This is quite the fucking tool
[4:21:09] <tukds> was the body strap there before
[4:21:09] <funwashere> Now I see why I never got into these games LUL
[4:21:11] <bettysharkface> Well...she knew about the serial killer prior
[4:21:21] <thealsian> So did she plan it this whole time?
[4:21:25] <+JailShmixRemix> no
[4:21:25] <tanarath> ok, soooooooo
[4:21:39] <heartlesshealer> but they gotta feel smrt
[4:21:43] <Shadope342> young master she HAS to be against a DOOR
[4:21:44] <CrimsonFox777> Gotta implicate Hiyoko somehow.
[4:21:45] <tanarath> Who killed the people?
[4:21:45] <Phob05> So gremlin's in the closet in this shot yes?
[4:21:46] <+shaidot> tbf I think this is the only one this bad
[4:22:16] <+shaidot> akane exists
[4:22:23] <+MisterRockett> This series doesn't take that into account xD
[4:22:31] <tukds> nagging coomer
[4:22:31] <+JailShmixRemix> I do D:
[4:22:33] <bevyrage> you say that but have you seen who lives?
[4:22:42] <RadioRaptor> wraithStab wraithStab wraithStab
[4:22:46] <bevyrage> and then look at how much porn there is of the survivors compared to the ones who died
[4:23:00] <CalderGaming> the FIRST EXECUTION in the last game was a girl
[4:23:04] <syanplague> She not evil, she is hot so is moraly gray
[4:23:13] <TheAntiNihilist> nooope
[4:23:13] <bevyrage> it was a fake execution calder
[4:23:18] <bettysharkface> ResidentSleeper Just let someone die so I can stop watching
[4:23:20] <YakumoYomi> The what?
[4:23:29] <+JailShmixRemix> go to sleep betty
[4:23:29] <tukds> How long was this trial?
[4:23:35] <CalderGaming> @bevyrage oh no I meant the trial execution
[4:23:37] <+shaidot> he was thinking about it
[4:23:40] <BlueLunecy> He can do whatever he wants
[4:23:51] <layZman> realistically monokuma could just kill them all on a whim
[4:23:51] <grandchickenlord> Bold of you to assume they need to be alive for doujinshi
[4:23:52] <+teriyaki_drinker> I think this ones pretty cool
[4:23:57] <+HawkGoggles2> I wasted all of your time, as a joke.
[4:24:06] <CursedNobleman> uhhhhhhhh
[4:24:09] <TheHauntedTank> pinocchio is a real boy now
[4:24:11] <tanarath> What if we killed the bear?
[4:24:15] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:24:16] <bevyrage> oooh
[4:24:16] <$JobbedBone> so monokuma is implied to NOT be omniscient?
[4:24:17] <tukds> V3 or 3?
[4:24:17] <+lemonsakee> 3 is an anime
[4:24:19] <bevyrage> nah she wasn't hot enough
[4:24:21] <%MajorCrasher> no
[4:24:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[4:24:24] <+shaidot> the anime takes place both before and after
[4:24:25] <+JailShmixRemix> you'll find out
[4:24:26] <redial_nick> sort of
[4:24:26] <fran031> 3 is half a prequel and half a sequel
[4:24:29] <CursedNobleman> well, we know theres at least 3.
[4:24:30] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[4:24:34] <+xiccy> By 3 do you mean the anime, the other anime, or the game
[4:24:35] <+Promessa_EX> Guess what you'll have to watch the animes
[4:24:36] <fran031> V3 is just a sequel
[4:24:40] <cerazor01> There's also a Danganronpa 0
[4:24:40] <tattleworm> there are two spinoffs
[4:24:41] <heavenlygunner> The anime is forgettable in all its shite
[4:24:41] <+Promessa_EX> required viewing
[4:24:45] <+lemonsakee> the anime is the ending, v3 isnt related to this storyline
[4:24:47] <Futurecity10> apparently 3 split the community
[4:24:47] <+doctor_piranha> Don't watch the anime you'll likely fuckin hate it
[4:24:49] <Johnmaddened> the anime is.... a thing
[4:24:51] <+crowmium> Also, is it ever explained what happens to the characters after 1? Wasn't the world like post-apocalyptic at the end?
[4:25:00] <+HawkGoggles2> ???
[4:25:04] <+xiccy> all 3's suck tho
[4:25:05] <+shaidot> Ryoko Otonashi could've been more important
[4:25:09] <SuperVaderMan> Sorry that I'm the worst person imaginable, peko
[4:25:09] <tanarath> DESPITE BEING Y A K U Z A
[4:25:11] <+Promessa_EX> @crowmium it's in the anime

[4:25:25] <cerazor01> ResidentSleeper
[4:25:29] <+crowmium> Promessa_EX lame
[4:25:31] <heavenlygunner> The pottery did it\
[4:25:33] <syanplague> in 3 the anime there a screen of another killing game, but it was just everybody killing everybody
[4:25:36] <+JailShmixRemix> LUL murders are the most kind hearted people

[4:30:11] <CursedNobleman> ... LUL
[4:30:18] <$JobbedBone> so monokuma has infinite money/resources
[4:30:21] <SirFancySwank> he didnt
[4:30:21] <Ouimjuips> f r o t h
[4:30:36] <ducellion> he isnt sadly
[4:30:38] <+JailShmixRemix> Pain Peko
[4:30:40] <+lemonsakee> monokuma bought a shitload of bitcoin in 2007
[4:30:47] <bettysharkface> Ugh
[4:30:48] <YakumoYomi> I don't like Domino's.
[4:30:53] <SuperVaderMan> Where did this happen, how did it happen, what's going on, who even knows
[4:31:13] <tanarath> pfffff
[4:31:13] <CursedNobleman> learn to make oven pizza?
[4:31:20] <TheAntiNihilist> the Execution Dimension is probably one of the biggest problem for the narrative. WAAAY too much style over substance
[4:31:20] <+shaidot> pizza hut is pretty good here
[4:31:21] <Maids4lyfe> pizza hut is worse
[4:31:24] <+kewlmyc> I feel that. Pizza Hut vs Domino's seems like cat piss vs dog shit.
[4:31:25] <tanarath> pizza hut is a void zone
[4:31:26] <Phob05> why is anyone updet over this
[4:31:29] <heavenlygunner> There is only one thing to do.
[4:31:30] <Phob05> upset
[4:31:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> There's an italian place in my town that has great pizza, but it takes like 30 minutes and I gotta go pick it up
[4:31:32] <+doctor_piranha> Pizza Hut is gross. Waaaaaaaaaay too greasy
[4:31:33] <heavenlygunner> Manage the pizzahut
[4:31:44] <tacostarvedbeast> “Technically” have a Pizza Hut?
[4:31:49] <SuperVaderMan> "Friends" is an incredibly strong word
[4:31:55] <YakumoYomi> Agreed. Little Caesar's seems to be the safest bet around here but...it's still pretty mediocre.
[4:31:56] <JackPot_ALX> Dominoe’s only sounds like a special type of hell
[4:31:57] <+JailShmixRemix> Wait, hes crazy!? D:
[4:32:07] <omenesia> Always has been
[4:32:20] <RadioRaptor> Shut up soggy-toe! SMOrc
[4:32:27] <CalderGaming> a plush robot?
[4:32:27] <Owkono> Frozen pizza is good enough for me, and cheaper than delivery
[4:32:37] <+Promessa_EX> he's a fnaf
[4:32:39] <SirFancySwank> he is a robot
[4:32:39] <+MisterRockett> He's teddy bare shapped.
[4:32:45] <tukds> probably wrapped in cotton
[4:32:47] <cerazor01> @PlagueOfGripes give this douche a noogie
[4:33:01] <SuperVaderMan> Mr stark I don't feel so good
[4:33:01] <+Tommyrats> Yeah hes not sposed to look like that
[4:33:04] <heavenlygunner> Oh shit I see it
[4:33:04] <bettysharkface> Pixel hell
[4:33:06] <+lemonsakee> spike chunsoft are not good at making games
[4:33:10] <heavenlygunner> Now I can't unsee it and It hurts
[4:33:12] <+lemonsakee> they made those terrible shounen jump games
[4:33:15] <tukds> They didn't expect you to see it on the psp
[4:33:28] <bettysharkface> I dunno, the shading looks kinda fucky too
[4:33:31] <omenesia> And those awful Dragon Quest games too
[4:33:32] <tanarath> They copied and flipped it?
[4:33:42] <+JailShmixRemix> PogChamp He lived
[4:33:53] <terminusterminal> Just a cockroach
[4:33:54] <+JailShmixRemix> ye
[4:34:02] <heavenlygunner> He is in a dumpster
[4:34:02] <bettysharkface> I...I can't watch this any more
[4:34:02] <SirFancySwank> fuyuhiko is the best
[4:34:03] <+JailShmixRemix> hes right next to them
[4:34:08] <SuperVaderMan> Why do they care? Why
[4:34:10] <+HawkGoggles2> Movement is a free action.
[4:34:13] <YakumoYomi> Spuhk...!
[4:34:17] <tukds> why
[4:34:17] <CursedNobleman> LIVE. LUL
[4:34:19] <+JailShmixRemix> @bettysharkface have a nice day sharky HeyGuys
[4:34:19] <cerazor01> FailFish
[4:34:24] <tukds> WW2
[4:34:25] <tanarath> No, the murderer is going to die
[4:34:32] <fran031> It's related to buddhism
[4:34:35] <skelfae> same with Naruto writer
[4:34:36] <tanarath> let him fucking die
[4:34:37] <CursedNobleman> good old-old testament justice
[4:34:40] <+JailShmixRemix> D:
[4:34:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Don't you want this noble yakuza to live?
[4:34:42] <skelfae> and studio Ghibli
[4:34:45] <tukds> Nank-
[4:34:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> WW2
[4:34:48] <heavenlygunner> To think that being cut with a sword from the crotch upward. He is still alive, also after being stabbed by robots with Peko
[4:34:51] <+lemonsakee> lmao that snake guy in naruto is still alive
[4:34:51] <grandchickenlord> It’s okay not to forgive
[4:34:55] <Maids4lyfe> it's because the criminal justice system doesn't forgive anyone
[4:34:55] <+lemonsakee> same with frieza
[4:34:58] <+zepelinnn1> what is a naking
[4:35:00] <+Onionchamp> Would malpractice be considered murder in this game?
[4:35:06] <sosuke5> it's not just japanese writers at this point.
[4:35:06] <Solokaldaka> No
[4:35:08] <SirFancySwank> he didnt actually murder anyone both in game and the fake game
[4:35:08] <Arancet> think its more not 'disrupting society' more than dealing with the criminals
[4:35:09] <CursedNobleman> japan... was not the worst outcome.
[4:35:12] <Maids4lyfe> guilty until proven innocent, and then forced to commit suicide by public shame
[4:35:18] <Futurecity10> Idk, a good nuke here or there could solve a few problems
[4:35:24] <TheAntiNihilist> but suicide bombers are A-okay
[4:35:30] <+kewlmyc> "eh fuck him"
[4:35:33] <tukds> lynch him!
[4:35:34] <+JailShmixRemix> Finish him off
[4:35:34] <CursedNobleman> GUN.
[4:35:39] <Shadope342> LUL
[4:35:41] <SuperVaderMan> Just step on him LUL
[4:35:42] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[4:35:43] <heavenlygunner> There would be causalities every 5 minutes.
[4:35:45] <layZman> they'd kill each other in the first day
[4:35:47] <explodedpoet> what about if they were canadian students?
[4:35:48] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[4:35:50] <kiwicoffin> just leave him here
[4:35:58] <CursedNobleman> @tukds miiiiiight want to refrain from using that word in the future. problematic.
[4:36:00] <Solokaldaka> by the power of GUN I pronounce him dead
[4:36:00] <Furrymessiah> Good evening Plague
[4:36:02] <%MajorCrasher> if they were american students they'd all be dead in 48 hours of the beginning of the game
[4:36:04] <+JailShmixRemix> American students wouldnt be able to solve any murder cases
[4:36:06] <Ks201> therr would be multi murders day one
[4:36:10] <RadioRaptor> LUL killing game  would just be a school shooting Kappa
[4:36:14] <Maids4lyfe> no pee is sterile
[4:36:20] <Ks201> with obvious suspects
[4:36:23] <YakumoYomi> Doody?
[4:36:29] <+derg0ns> I mean american schools areabout likely to fill you with holes as monokuma island is
[4:36:29] <Maids4lyfe> gotta shit in the wounds
[4:36:37] <heavenlygunner> Shit heals all wounds.
[4:36:41] <LVL1_Scumbag> Urine is sterile. Poop would work, but the toilet clogger is already dead.
[4:36:43] <kiwicoffin> He's litter if he's a corpse

[4:37:14] <kiwicoffin> boring ass rule 6
[4:37:50] <SirFancySwank> monokuma has to follow the rules
[4:37:50] <$JobbedBone> didn't it say if ONLY?
[4:37:56] <+JailShmixRemix> So he can have a badass scar
[4:38:00] <syanplague> well i need to go
[4:38:05] <+Promessa_EX> it's so he could have an eyepatch eli
[4:38:07] <Maids4lyfe> to make you feel bad
[4:38:07] <$Rezca> it was a good tease though
[4:38:09] <Shadope342> Punished Boss Baby
[4:38:10] <syanplague> thanks plague for the stream
[4:38:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Just to get your hopes up
[4:38:11] <OzeanSusceptor> by that logic, couldn't they just leave him to die and accuse monokuma of breaking his own rules?
[4:38:18] <+JailShmixRemix> SourPls
[4:38:23] <heavenlygunner> I mean saving him and keeping him alive are two different things
[4:38:24] <SirFancySwank> it was dramatic for the characters arc
[4:38:30] <$JobbedBone> photoshop truck monkaS
[4:38:43] <YakumoYomi> LUL

[4:39:39] <ZComiX> You think this whole thing was so the artist could draw an ambulance? Bc it was super detailed
[4:39:40] <CursedNobleman> perfectly round
[4:39:41] <heavenlygunner> Its anime tiddy logic. It just works
[4:39:41] <+kewlmyc> Assuming she's wearing a bra

[4:41:04] <TIME_PUNCHER> "We nee unity right now"
[4:41:08] <+JailShmixRemix> Because its dumb
