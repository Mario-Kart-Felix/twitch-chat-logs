[0:07:23] <Skawtzilla> Good evening plague, hope you're doing ok
[0:07:31] <JoshManVGH> How do they make monsters...
[0:07:49] <+ToeBeanHeaven> V-Tubers should have taken off, I can't browse the internet without bumping into debuts, established models or some VTuber Merchandise.
[0:07:55] <defaultname3887> we all know plague is gonna fall for tasque master
[0:08:10] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Sure have taken off, even. My mind typed one thing and I internally said another.
[0:08:54] <Puhff> Yeah Paige streams have gone up by 300% since the Vtuber debut
[0:08:55] <+ToeBeanHeaven> As a fat fuck myself, I wouldn't mind having a Vtube-Sona.
[0:09:09] <SuperVaderMan> I'd imagine it's nice being able to web-cam but not really
[0:09:43] <Puhff> Yeah Plague is streaming more than Paige, what a horrifying world
[0:09:51] <kinetikpaws> internet's been better recently for ya?
[0:10:09] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague, I'd imagine you'd stream a fuckton more if you actually had access to a proper, dedicated ISP. I can't imagine the amounts of headaches you get from that detriment alone
[0:10:39] <kinetikpaws> i jinxed it
[0:10:45] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Good job, Paws.
[0:10:55] <Puhff> Plan in one hand; shit in the other. See which fills up first
[0:11:20] <Bullethead1010> How are things plague?
[0:11:28] <Puhff> Good internet is the only thing keeping us from PlagueofGripes OnlyFans
[0:11:54] <jerommal> howdy plague
[0:12:38] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Puhff knows what's up.
[0:13:19] <jerommal> it's always fun to see experienced artists draw... you make pretty clean and good looking art in what seems like a really short time
[0:13:23] <joe724> I can understand the internet thing satellite internet is my only option out in the sticks. I couldn't imagine needed it for my job with my data cap.
[0:13:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Honestly, the movie thing is better than I thought it'd be
[0:13:52] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague if I ever win the Lottery/find myself receiving a metric fuckton of additional income, I'd buy you a pizza.
[0:14:01] <+Archphronimos> oh snap I was just watching your vod of "THE APE" with Paige
[0:14:14] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I just don't want ya to get slapped even though they're public domain movies.
[0:14:35] <kinetikpaws> yea isn't there like a 24/7 rifftrax twitch channel always showing that stuff?
[0:14:55] <+lordericter> oh man drawin the Snuffy Milf
[0:15:14] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Snuffy knows her audience, that's for goddamned sure.
[0:15:38] <vonmaultke> It takes me a while but I think it’s mainly because I have to go back and correct everything a couple times
[0:15:42] <+ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, sometimes out loud too. It's not great
[0:15:44] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague's cat is so into the work that it looks like its having a perpetual seizure.
[0:15:46] <Puhff> Oh yeah. Sometimes brain voice straight lies too LUL
[0:15:46] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Cute.
[0:15:48] <vonmaultke> All the time

[0:16:14] <+lordericter> snuffMask
[0:16:25] <Puhff> That's why I loved Disco Elysium so much; my brain more or less works the same way as Harry's
[0:16:26] <%KellBeII> cute snuffy
[0:16:37] <mike2hands> hello there
[0:16:38] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I told myself I'd get more projects I want to do done once my company secures a patrol vehicle for my current job site. But as it stands, I'm much too fucking tired after work everyday to do anything extra.
[0:16:57] <$JobbedBone> I cannot make myself skip getting five starts on everybody, so its a big ordeal
[0:16:59] <%KellBeII> i require bad movies
[0:17:04] <$JobbedBone> five stars*
[0:17:07] <Puhff> I got nabbed by ghost hands as soon as the tutorial was over for Death Strando and shut down my console in a panic
[0:17:09] <JovianGargoyle> never
[0:17:17] <Puhff> Never went back
[0:17:36] <+ToeBeanHeaven> How bold of you to assume we possess any normal level of intelligence, we're a chaotic cognitive collective.

[0:25:03] <+ToeBeanHeaven> "That man is creeping me the fuck out...LEMME JUST MOVE 2 FEET OVER, THAT'LL STOP IT!"

[0:26:37] <+ToeBeanHeaven> 1944 according to Google.
[0:26:39] <%Heart0fInk> Nah. just an old pedo
[0:26:41] <Glasphemy> murdergram
[0:26:41] <+ToeBeanHeaven> So, Puhff wins.

[0:27:24] <arkv01> plague you just did an ahegao with your kitty LUL
[0:27:30] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I'm sure most performance artists these days have some sort of therapy expert on staff for safety reasons.
[0:27:31] <vonmaultke> Frankstein sends his regards
[0:27:39] <%Heart0fInk> Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh fuck this guy..

[0:28:46] <%impulse255dj> 1944 for those who were placing bets.
[0:28:47] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Ogling, I've always liked that word.
[0:28:49] <+Dakuu75> there is NOT a difference between staring and ogling
[0:29:03] <%Heart0fInk> Is snuffy standing next to MLP cum jars? what are those?
[0:29:10] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague should apply the use of Ogling into his day-to-day lexicon more.
[0:29:39] <%lemoan> @Heart0fInk MILK
[0:29:41] <+Betofall> I hate it when my doorman doxxes me

[0:35:37] <+Dakuu75> I mean... you made the bars big enough that he can reach through them... that's pretty dangerous
[0:35:47] <JoshManVGH> It's not as though he could reach THROUGH the bars, or anything...
[0:35:48] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague trying to induce boners and laughter with his multi-projection stream content.
[0:36:00] <+Jrockoni> ...does he just drug the gorilla all day?
[0:36:03] <$JobbedBone> pretending to be something inhuman is the height of acting Kappa
[0:36:10] <%impulse255dj> "We paid for the suit and by god were going to get our moneys worth. Now write in a gorilla!"
[0:36:14] <JoshManVGH> Aww good puppers
[0:36:14] <%Heart0fInk> He looks like a bitch is what he looks like
[0:36:18] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Maybe his lower hair is just greyed/whited so it looks like a fade.
[0:36:25] <JovianGargoyle> God forbid we have an orangutan in the lab once in awhile.
[0:36:26] <%ralphwiggum16> The dog's name is Ace the Wonder Dog.

[0:37:12] <$JobbedBone> dat Ahoge
[0:37:20] <lewdnekojam> he is going to marry the monkey?
[0:37:23] <JoshManVGH> Uh...

[0:38:30] <JoshManVGH> Acrogmaolgy?
[0:38:30] <+ToeBeanHeaven> PLague has a bottle of ALL the drugs.
[0:38:31] <+Dakuu75> more like, aggro-my-gollie
[0:38:37] <+ToeBeanHeaven> In case of fire, ya know?
[0:38:42] <%impulse255dj> act casual
[0:38:44] <+storebrandcandy> Acromegaly is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone, causing body tissues and bones to grow more quickly. Over time, this leads to abnormally large hands and feet, and a wide range of other symptoms.
[0:39:08] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Oh Jesus, that sounds serious, Store.
[0:39:16] <JoshManVGH> Why is he being cage with his thirsty receptionist who already knows his dark secrets?
[0:39:45] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I love rotary phones.
[0:39:57] <+Dakuu75> is he trying to drug him, after he died?
[0:40:04] <JoshManVGH> "Whelp, better make it look like he was on drugs, so I can get away with that self defense defense"
[0:40:06] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Used to have one in the first house I was raised in. It was in the wash room on the wall.
[0:40:48] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Don't worry about it, just come and pick up your father...alone and unarmed with no police, please.
[0:40:55] <JoshManVGH> "You should TOTALLY come get him... alone... wear something nice"
[0:41:00] <+ToeBeanHeaven> ^
[0:41:17] <+Dakuu75> is he trying to make him seem drunk? i'm so confused
[0:41:26] <%lemoan> @ToeBeanHeaven "and be sure to make yourself EXTRA kidnappable"
[0:41:32] <+ToeBeanHeaven> The Brapomatic, makes the squeakiest braps you ever heard.
[0:41:40] <JoshManVGH> How long is she going to have to cook drugs for this evil man?
[0:41:52] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague, people STILL do that.
[0:42:09] <%Heart0fInk> They smoked like chimneys
[0:42:12] <Dunmarkh> smoking on fuckin airplanes
[0:42:12] <lewdnekojam> 40% US economy was based on cigars alone in 40s
[0:42:14] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I saw a homeless guy snort a line of the white powder across the street from the uni just last Thursday.
[0:42:27] <+Faustgesicht> Shove tapeworms up my ass while drinking cocaine soda
[0:42:31] <JoshManVGH> This is Igors Indecent Proposal.
[0:42:42] <%Heart0fInk> We put your dad in the ape cage
[0:42:52] <+ToeBeanHeaven> That's a HUGE fuck.
[0:42:58] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Steve.
[0:43:00] <+Dakuu75> Steve, I think
[0:43:03] <%Heart0fInk> he got over his murder pretty well..
[0:43:08] <Moldy_Giraffe> Steven Steel
[0:43:14] <+ToeBeanHeaven> You got a man named IGOR MARKOFF...and his ASSISTANT!....Steve.
[0:43:16] <+Dakuu75> "Meet my assistant... Steve."
[0:43:31] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Hahaha indeed
[0:43:34] <+theRx_> How's it going drawing Snu- *leans in* Smilfy?
[0:43:41] <JoshManVGH> He may act werid... on account of the drugs.
[0:43:55] <+hrbeck_> chekov's ape
[0:43:56] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I'm just waiting for the...Ape Escape Kappa
[0:44:07] <JoshManVGH> Chekolves Ape
[0:44:28] <+KingKrampus> what is Plague watching?
[0:44:30] <+Dakuu75> They probably drugged that animal, to get it to act like that
[0:44:38] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Monster Maker from the 1940s.
[0:44:44] <lewdnekojam> the ape could be the lawyer for all we know
[0:45:13] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Markoff kinda looks like a rounderfaced Robert Downey Jr.
[0:45:13] <JoshManVGH> Oh he just had a bottle of a pathogen in his office.
[0:45:24] <windchaser_711> if I may say love your content and vibes syerniHype itsque4Love
[0:45:35] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Dr. Markoff's secret is that he downs half a bottle of Absinthe before every surgery.
[0:45:49] <+Dakuu75> uhh... ok...
[0:45:54] <JoshManVGH> And just injected it into his stalkiees father.
[0:46:05] <+ToeBeanHeaven> BITCH!

[0:46:12] <%Heart0fInk> stop!
[0:46:27] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Oh so she has a room now.
[0:46:46] <+Dakuu75> Man, they really did smoke a ton in the 50's or w/e
[0:46:48] <JoshManVGH> "Just need to go down to the market for a cup of Police, be back soon!"
[0:46:50] <%Heart0fInk> wemen. im i rite?
[0:47:04] <%KellBeII> directors are still stupid assholes

[0:47:27] <JovianGargoyle> Rebecca Cunningham, there I said it.
[0:47:46] <+Dakuu75> You know how pissed I'd be if someone in my house was playing the piano at 3 am
[0:48:02] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Depends on what kind of music was being played.
[0:48:12] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I can fall asleep to piano jazz.
[0:48:19] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Now if he did that shit, I'd get my gun.
[0:48:26] <TimetodiveLTX> of the Hot Sluts presented to us by the Trickster Dog,
[0:48:29] <TimetodiveLTX> not finishing this
[0:48:46] <+ToeBeanHeaven> "I'll save your father's career if you suck my dick"
[0:48:49] <lewdnekojam> ah yes the ancient plauge of going bananas
[0:48:58] <%Heart0fInk> the sausage finger-itus
[0:49:06] <+Dakuu75> lol, these deflections are so bad

[0:49:47] <%TheLordOfTheScrubs> bad case of Gigantostupiditus
[0:49:53] <+Dakuu75> He probably drinks too much 50's Coke-Cola
[0:50:00] <%Heart0fInk> If i had the ability to make peoples hands and feet bigger i would. just to fuck with them
[0:50:03] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Well....I mean in this instance even a small increase of joint size seems to just fuck up their ability to perform so...imagine if he did his mojo on a Precision Surgeon or something...
[0:50:42] <%Puhff> Ah yes of course, of the Manhattan Kruger's.
[0:50:42] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Rare, yes. Unless INDUCED. Not that I'd know about that....
[0:51:04] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Does Acromegaly(sp) affect the heart?
[0:51:12] <%Heart0fInk> It makes your penis bigger...
[0:51:13] <%Puhff> Makes sex feel real weird man
[0:51:19] <+ThomasOfTroy> Is it Igor Markov??

[0:52:20] <JoshManVGH> oh neat, Dopamine is part of the treatment.
[0:52:24] <+Dakuu75> imagine a disease where only ONE PERSON on the fucking planet knew anything about it
[0:52:33] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Hypertension is among the most common complications of acromegaly.
[0:52:39] <%Heart0fInk> This is like that anthrax guy isn't it?
[0:52:48] <JoshManVGH> "No thanks, I'll just die"
[0:52:53] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I can't imagine have a house more than 1-floor.
[0:53:00] <+ThomasOfTroy> I have relatives named Igor, I feel attacked

[1:03:35] <lewdnekojam> i can imagine her ankles right now
[1:03:36] <+hrbeck_> yeah, it was considered cleaner and fashionable
[1:03:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> Calling it now, the weird gorilla thing is his wife who's in the late stages of acromegaly, which is why he's an expert and why he hasn't shared any data on his work trying to cure her
[1:03:45] <%theloganbrand> an unmarried naked lady? what a whore!

[1:07:53] <JoshManVGH> @lewdnekojam They haven't named it, but he admitted to infecting his wife wifh the growth disease, so my money is on monkey wife
[1:07:58] <Heyestus> In the 40s having lots of houseplants was a status symbol in the US
[1:08:00] <+Dakuu75> that gorilla put a lot of stats into stealth
[1:08:03] <%Heart0fInk> I will name him Bobolo-Bimblo

[1:14:22] <+ThomasOfTroy> I doubt they put the thought into it, but if Markov is slavic, he might have been using the term sanatorium in the slavic sense of a health resort
[1:14:22] <%Heart0fInk> the door is a chocolate bar

[1:30:53] <JoshManVGH> I can't beleive that Paige isn't here for The Screaming Skull
[1:30:58] <RiftRulerRaust> killing 233 viewers by streaming this movie surely must be against Twitch TOS? Kappa

[1:31:19] <+Dakuu75> I'm like... overly curious about who played "Steve" in the last movie and to know if he was in anything else. But, no enough to look into it
[1:31:25] <+hrbeck_> that car is half the budget
[1:31:27] <JoshManVGH> THE COOLEST MOST IMPRACTICAL OF DOORS!
[1:31:27] <Maids4lyfe> twitch staff would also die from the screaming skull so it balances out
[1:31:53] <jaypeesan> oh look a cock

[1:37:39] <%RykerSkies> Mickey is clearly very stable, I forsee no issues
[1:37:56] <jowi_time> I wonder how dark that make up actually was to have it show up on film
[1:38:04] <sirion_mercvr> true
[1:38:27] <%RykerSkies> they used to use blue makeup for that reason iirc
[1:38:37] <%Bigchill___> I SWEAR I THOUGHT HE HAD A VAPE WHEN HE WAS BITING HIS FINGER
[1:38:45] <+Mrbaconator> are you suggesting they had to use make up so dark it might as well be black face for it to show up
[1:38:49] <sirion_mercvr> uh hoh.......

[2:33:22] <+tussletoes> i love crow features
[2:33:25] <thefishofwar> I love this stream for real
[2:33:46] <%RykerSkies> what a let down that was
[2:33:51] <marklarphd> Sounds hot
[2:33:55] <%FingaLights> That was such a let down
[2:33:56] <+Shaggnar> That movie made me loose hope for good tittles
[2:34:01] <+lordericter> she beast was also kinda watery

[2:35:25] <%EyeFarted> penetrating
[2:35:29] <$SGrim> We must penetrate space!
[2:35:30] <L4nc3murdock> penatrate that vastness
[2:35:38] <%PleasantLee> this is pretty dope looking so far
[2:35:40] <JoshManVGH> Penetrating!
[2:35:42] <thefishofwar> Penetrate space, daddy
[2:35:44] <+tussletoes> The future...
[2:35:45] <+Shaggnar> @tussletoes It was for MacArthur LUL
[2:35:45] <%EyeFarted> PENETRATE THE NIGHT
[2:35:46] <%FingaLights> The Future of 1978
[2:35:51] <DimBulb999> ah, mysterious future
[2:35:54] <JoshManVGH> Thrusting again and again... into SPACE!
[2:36:03] <+Berrsy> Just you wait as soon as money is found in space, things will get exciting again
[2:36:04] <marklarphd> The composer for this movie did the soundtrack for Women of the Prehistoric Planet
[2:36:07] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes the 40's, 50's, and 80's had a future.
[2:36:13] <$SGrim> 60*
[2:36:16] <theanora1> and now their kids are destroying our future
[2:36:18] <%PleasantLee> uh oh. this movie has a 3.7 on imdb, screaming skull had 3.9
[2:36:24] <+tussletoes> @Shaggnar that wacky macarthur!!! what a goof
[2:36:26] <+Berrsy> Planet of the goblin gurls
[2:36:27] <%FingaLights> NotLikeThis
[2:36:28] <%impulse255dj> Ohhh just you wait untill you see the creature
[2:36:33] <+Cevune> "we didn't do anything" I'm literally watching an anime eyed purple cat drawing a portrait of a half racoon half human woman, in real time, from half a nation away. I beg to differ
[2:36:42] <%Pappajimbo> eh we got the internet porn. more smut thany ine could have dreamed of
[2:36:43] <thefishofwar> I hope this movie has the skull content I crave
[2:36:46] <%Bigchill___> zooom
[2:36:47] <JoshManVGH> Wha!? The beginning!?
[2:36:56] <+lordericter> eventually we will invent a deep sim that let's you explore a less boring universe and then we can all give up on actual life
[2:36:56] <%FingaLights> I love these opening narrations. They need to bring that back
[2:37:03] <$SGrim> @Cevune We chose a different, forsaken, path to the future.
[2:37:06] <Dunmarkh> what are those flight suits?
[2:37:15] <DimBulb999> the planet of no-tech effects
[2:37:19] <%PleasantLee> I'm liking the production of this so far
[2:37:20] <JovianGargoyle> Title still says screaming skull.
[2:37:37] <JoshManVGH> United States SPACE FORCE Lunar Base 1, thank you very much
[2:37:46] <Ruonation> It's quiet and lonely out here. *looks longingly at co-pilot*
[2:37:48] <thefishofwar> "space travel is as lame as this set"
[2:37:57] <+tussletoes> in space we only have each other...
[2:38:18] <+tussletoes> oh no popeyes chicken
[2:38:26] <JoshManVGH> Wow they really didn't have the engineers jargon down at this point huh
[2:38:30] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:38:30] <thefishofwar> YES
[2:38:31] <%PleasantLee> waaaah
[2:38:38] <JoshManVGH> Star Trek really blazed a trail there
[2:38:40] <+Shaggnar> Grunting harder makes the ship move more gooder
[2:38:50] <JoshManVGH> Farted out the title
[2:38:59] <+Berrsy> They need to be careful, if they run out of gas they might need to get out and push
[2:39:09] <Schuhart> You deserve the joy, Plague
[2:39:21] <L4nc3murdock> little rocks on strings
[2:39:47] <DimBulb999> interstellaar chicken nuggets
[2:40:08] <+Berrsy> oat clusters
[2:40:15] <+Shaggnar> The oat chunks
[2:40:15] <%impulse255dj> oat clusters
[2:40:25] <DimBulb999> ort clusters
[2:40:28] <%PleasantLee> eat the healthy cereal, just corn flakes and nothing else
[2:40:36] <marklarphd> Just eat oatmeal instead
[2:40:37] <+Berrsy> @DimBulb999 Well done
[2:40:38] <%JayCantDo> Raisin Bran Pretty good
[2:40:40] <L4nc3murdock> why is cereal bad for ya?
[2:40:46] <+tussletoes> is there any good healthy cereal. or is it just the ones that suck ass
[2:40:56] <Ruonation> Because cereal was made to stop you from touching yourself.
[2:40:59] <Ruonation> So it's bad for you.
[2:41:06] <+tussletoes> mind you "healthy" means "not horribly bad for you" to me
[2:41:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:41:18] <%Explodincatz> I love this outer wilds plot
[2:41:24] <L4nc3murdock> @Ruonation That's just Corn flakes
[2:41:36] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:41:41] <marklarphd> @Explodincatz That reminds me that the Outer Wilds DLC comes out in 2 days
[2:41:57] <Ruonation> HE SAID IT
[2:42:10] <%Explodincatz> cableble
[2:42:12] <thefishofwar> This was unironically someone's favorite movie at some point
[2:42:15] <+Cevune> It's weird to consider sci-fi space craft manned by current era dress uniform wearing officers
[2:42:17] <$SGrim> @tussletoes Humans can eat basically anything in moderation. Unless your gorging yourself on them, most commercial cereals is fine.
[2:42:25] <+FilthyHereticHorus> It's TV's Steve Carrel!
[2:42:27] <DimBulb999> nice
[2:42:32] <+Berrsy> Is that a still suit?
[2:42:45] <+tussletoes> @SGrim yeah true!
[2:42:49] <thefishofwar> "Frank, people actually for real died"
[2:43:09] <DimBulb999> thought it was nick adams
[2:43:26] <Blak3_Nikos> Frank almost sounds like Anthony Nelson from I Dream Of Jeannie
[2:44:02] <%Heart0fInk> its a womb tattoo
[2:44:08] <%Murphio_GS> Oh no
[2:44:16] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes it might be the deathly hallows symbol from Harry Potter
[2:44:53] <thefishofwar> The phantom planet is holding two branches
[2:45:01] <%RykerSkies> i think it is just a warning symbol
[2:45:45] <vonpimpenstein> god damn that's a tired cat
[2:45:47] <%Heart0fInk> got me some pizza
[2:46:19] <%Pappajimbo> lighting rods would beg to differ
[2:46:24] <marklarphd> It might technically be true if you consider the expansion of the universe
[2:46:57] <%PleasantLee> whats the warning for?
[2:47:11] <$SGrim> meaty whores?
[2:47:14] <DimBulb999> nuggets ahoy
[2:47:22] <%Heart0fInk> honey bunches of death
[2:47:26] <thelonechris> Watch out for those JPEG's
[2:47:30] <$SGrim> @PleasantLee bomb-ass pussy
[2:47:34] <%RykerSkies> space granola nooooo
[2:48:44] <Ruonation> more art thieves goin around, watch out plague
[2:49:30] <+wumpy3d> do you like payne from ffx-2, plague?
[2:49:35] <thefishofwar> "space drills"
[2:50:32] <Daxalog> This beat is pretty good
[2:50:44] <+tussletoes> space timbs
[2:50:48] <+Berrsy> They gotta push there rocket to the next space station
[2:51:00] <L4nc3murdock> Just pretend they're magnetic boots
[2:51:03] <%Heart0fInk> magnetic leather boots
[2:51:04] <%PleasantLee> that gas sure is noisy
[2:51:09] <JovianGargoyle> Sure is noisy in space
[2:51:13] <thefishofwar> Leather boots are magnetic if you think about it
[2:51:14] <%RykerSkies> it's centrifugal, the spaceship is doing really fast flips you just can't see it
[2:51:24] <thelonechris> LUL
[2:51:30] <thefishofwar> space slapstick!
[2:51:35] <%PleasantLee> this is 1961 too so well before hte lunar landing
[2:51:47] <Dunmarkh> oh he immediately suffocated
[2:52:05] <Dunmarkh> and then fell over from gravity?
[2:52:10] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:52:13] <ToneBacas> oh nooooo
[2:52:16] <L4nc3murdock> oh no
[2:52:22] <thefishofwar> oh no! space murder!

[2:52:42] <Ruonation> murica
[2:52:47] <%PleasantLee> no safety wires. this aeronautics organisation is a health and safety nightmare
[2:52:49] <+Berrsy> Good to know Jesus is in space
[2:52:54] <marklarphd> God is angry that he left the atmosphere
[2:52:55] <Schuhart> Should have had some rudimentary personal-vernier to get back.
[2:53:02] <thefishofwar> space hell is my favorite part of Event Horizon
[2:53:07] <L4nc3murdock> just pray and space Jesus will save you
[2:53:13] <thelonechris> Jesus is an alien
[2:53:17] <+BubbaRands> He'll get to meet space god which is better than regular god iguess?
[2:53:35] <thefishofwar> Do you think god ever gets jealous of space god
[2:53:35] <%Heart0fInk> Spesus if you will.
[2:53:46] <+Berrsy> You're right that's what that movie Prometheus told us right?
[2:54:03] <+Berrsy> Jesus was from space, and he made the xenomorphs
[2:54:05] <luftkrake> I knew microgravity is fake news
[2:54:29] <xilofone> how far up you guys think heaven is?
[2:54:35] <thefishofwar> oh no a space asteroid!
[2:54:38] <+tussletoes> too far
[2:54:50] <+Berrsy> It's okay jesus is his copilot
[2:55:11] <+Berrsy> Close up it appears to be fried chicken
[2:55:12] <L4nc3murdock> Jesus take the wheel!
[2:55:22] <lewdnekojam> hey guys i went to the bathroom and their this gaint ball of toxio plasmus sphere the size neptune stalking me should i be worried?
[2:55:36] <thefishofwar> Space LA looks just as shitty as normal LA

[2:55:42] <%lemoan> @lewdnekojam naaaah
[2:55:48] <+Berrsy> "I help those who help themselves" space jesus
[2:55:50] <L4nc3murdock> Oh no, not space commies
[2:56:08] <JoshManVGH> Oh sweet made it in time for a "zero g" space walk!

[2:56:53] <thefishofwar> man they're really space milking this scene
[2:57:00] <+tussletoes> what happened to him...
[2:57:03] <JoshManVGH> Is the phantom planet drugs?
[2:57:18] <+tussletoes> these edibles ain't sh-
[2:57:26] <+Berrsy> His last thoughts are people lecturing him...how sad
[2:57:34] <JoshManVGH> This isn't a space program... they're testing LSD!!
[2:57:37] <thelonechris> What the fuck
[2:57:43] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wait, what the fuck
[2:57:44] <+tussletoes> HAHA

[2:58:01] <thefishofwar> space leprechauns
[2:58:06] <+tussletoes> This is a 1950s kink vessel
[2:58:08] <Dunmarkh> they aren't that handsome
[2:58:14] <xilofone> because a space monter would be TOO farfetched, obviously

[2:58:50] <+tussletoes> imagine crashing in a distant planet and you just see a bunch of tiny zara employees wearing polos
[2:58:56] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague wants to anal vore the handsome smurfs.
[2:58:59] <thefishofwar> they're talking in space tongues!

[3:00:19] <%Heart0fInk> Ah yes the planet where you shrink. a favorite among the vore fetish people
[3:00:21] <thefishofwar> I can't believe they can all see his space junk
[3:00:34] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Tiny hands touching BIG HELMETS.
[3:00:44] <%Heart0fInk> Small and in another world?
[3:00:46] <+Berrsy> It must be cold in space, that is some serious shrinkage

[3:01:42] <%Heart0fInk> Ah these aliens speak English. thats good
[3:01:46] <+Dakuu75> I'm never a fan of cults, in movies. It always creeps me out
[3:01:50] <Dunmarkh> "little society"
[3:01:52] <%EyeFarted> meant to boo Berrsy for their bad joke
[3:01:53] <thefishofwar> oh of course, tiny space beaurocracy
[3:01:54] <JoshManVGH> So are women people in this society or are they 1940s women?
[3:02:01] <+ToeBeanHeaven> All the drugs.
[3:02:05] <+tussletoes> back when white people drugs hit different
[3:02:11] <DimBulb999> damn action distracted me and i missed the chain bending
[3:02:21] <+ToeBeanHeaven> I read that as Chain Breeding.

[3:02:31] <+LordSDB> cottonwLaff
[3:02:33] <L4nc3murdock> it was the 40's, everyone in hollywood was on drugs

[3:02:52] <+Dakuu75> did Plague draw the chain, link by link? or was it a brush? (I'm kinda in'n out)
[3:02:53] <DimBulb999> ah, sexy space babes
[3:02:56] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Frank Chaplain.

[3:04:15] <Dunmarkh> shit happens
[3:04:18] <JoshManVGH> enormous gravitational force of the tiny planet?
[3:04:24] <xilofone> me neither
[3:04:26] <+Berrsy> Space works via maritime law, smaller vessels need to give way for larger ones
[3:04:32] <lewdnekojam> space is like two whole texases
[3:04:32] <marklarphd> @JoshManVGH Could be really dense
[3:04:45] <JoshManVGH> This is the writers way of saying "fuck off with your questions"
[3:04:52] <EuropanLamprey> Well that's the shortest trial ever
[3:04:52] <+ToeBeanHeaven> @lewdnekojam Ya gotta say Howdy twice when ya fly by

[3:06:03] <kennethraptor> why do feel like all space women want the one eye space snake lol
[3:06:14] <+ToeBeanHeaven> My brain interpreted that as something lewder, plague.
[3:06:22] <DimBulb999> all our males are sterile
[3:06:23] <%PleasantLee> but that does mean watching harry potter
[3:06:25] <+ToeBeanHeaven> You're not...LEWD...are you?
[3:06:28] <%RykerSkies> it's cruel to tease us like that plague
[3:06:43] <DimBulb999> ... so we need ...

[3:09:03] <+squishy_777> sounds like modern day
[3:09:08] <%traximus_s> oof
[3:09:10] <stranger59> This is where America pretends working people to death is COOL
[3:09:16] <JoshManVGH> Ah yes the "Amazon is good, actually" argument
[3:09:20] <EuropanLamprey> Swing and a Miss
[3:09:22] <+NecDW4> lol
[3:09:34] <%PleasantLee> "people started fighting about stuff, so instead of hearing out the issues in case they had merit, we just killed the robots"
[3:09:48] <thefishofwar> salt
[3:09:50] <Dunmarkh> Eat the bugs, live in a pod, get in the wagie cage

[3:10:18] <thefishofwar> immersion broken, no realistic zipper
[3:10:19] <stranger59> A whole planet just to argue how good Capitalism is, despite all evidence to the contrary
[3:10:32] <%Heart0fInk> the perfect woman
[3:10:34] <+tussletoes> This is absolutely a sex pervert film
[3:10:38] <JoshManVGH> But... she just....what
[3:10:40] <Ruonation> I think it's just the one woman.
[3:10:46] <stranger59> Wait, then who can't speak?
[3:10:47] <Dunmarkh> No, the black hair one is the mute one
[3:10:50] <DimBulb999> only zeta

[3:11:00] <%impulse255dj> its just the brunet that cant speak
[3:11:05] <stranger59> She should have spoke up
[3:11:11] <thefishofwar> She's sad she's in a bad movie
[3:11:12] <Ruonation> "your bread food"
[3:11:17] <+Berrsy> She just ditched her hubby for the first alien that lands on her asteroid
[3:11:17] <xilofone> see her uterus?
[3:11:25] <%PleasantLee> the writer/director clearly hates how "easy" the gen Xers have it and hates when women talk
[3:11:40] <%Explodincatz> we eat the air ok
[3:11:47] <Dunmarkh> Wait how the fuck do atoms work?
[3:11:49] <stranger59> Oh, so they're like Maximals and Predicons, smaller to use less energy.
[3:11:53] <marklarphd> It's a lie. She's about to eat him
[3:11:56] <JoshManVGH> We get our nutrients from the shrinking gas!
[3:12:08] <%Heart0fInk> tiny adorable easily insurted into an oriface people

[3:12:41] <xilofone> I wonder if they'll fuck hmm
[3:12:48] <Schuhart> Harry.S Atom
[3:12:54] <Dunmarkh> This movie started with a nuclear explosion with a narration about the atom
[3:13:02] <Dunmarkh> how, what
[3:13:20] <%impulse255dj> he named the atom after the atom bomb which ironically was not atomic.
[3:13:24] <xilofone> guys it's obvious, they get 1 normal sized bread for 1000 years every millenium for all the population
[3:13:28] <+BubbaRands> @xilofone not a question of if, but how many

[3:19:45] <thefishofwar> Raycon needs to return to its charging case
[3:19:58] <stranger59> Science is so dense, every equation has so much going on.
[3:19:59] <JoshManVGH> Plague's Stand: 「Policy of Truth」
[3:20:00] <+ItalianWaifu> just a few million or so

[3:21:13] <+ToeBeanHeaven> Plague, you do that all the time Kappa
[3:21:16] <%PleasantLee> maybe they can speak only if they give up the right to vote
[3:21:26] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[3:22:37] <%Explodincatz> are we dogs?
[3:22:50] <%Heart0fInk> so you have to beat the children savagely to calm them down
[3:22:57] <+ToeBeanHeaven> You can animate the weirdness but I don't want to you just shit uncontrollably, you'll fucking die from dehydration you dingus.

[3:24:29] <+ItalianWaifu> tongue duel
[3:24:29] <Dunmarkh> Isn't dueling legal in brazil?
[3:24:31] <JoshManVGH> Showing the results of a duel seems like a bad idea
[3:24:31] <+BubbaRands> Like Duel Monsters?
[3:24:40] <+ToeBeanHeaven> DISINTEGRATE.
[3:24:40] <marklarphd> Yeah, but then some kid stoll my YuGiOh deck
[3:24:41] <%PleasantLee> does fighting other kids at the bike lockup after school count?

[3:24:45] <Daxalog> Let me show you. *steps on it*
[3:25:05] <JoshManVGH> But only if someone waves their hand on it?
[3:25:09] <thefishofwar> "the gravity plate is gonna make his pants fall down and everyone will laugh"
[3:25:28] <JoshManVGH> We all saw what happened to The Rock.
[3:25:31] <Daxalog> I just realized Star Trek is this but with color.

[3:26:08] <%PleasantLee> both these ladies died in the 90s
[3:26:13] <thefishofwar> Combat broken piece of a hand cart
[3:26:15] <%Rezca> reverse tug of war?
[3:26:21] <%Bigchill___> isn't this suppose to be about being brave?
[3:26:22] <%Heart0fInk> we may as well be watching skeletons walking around
[3:26:33] <JoshManVGH> So it's reverse tug of war with a trolly lever
[3:26:34] <+tussletoes> what is going on.
[3:26:40] <%Bigchill___> they are so brave!
[3:26:40] <xilofone> to ban ghte daughter an dsave christmas

[3:27:07] <Ruonation> This is supposed to be a test of BRAVERY btw
[3:27:08] <JoshManVGH> Seems like you could side step and let your opponent fall forward into your plate pretty eaisly
[3:27:10] <marklarphd> Because Sumo was too gay
[3:27:30] <+tussletoes> he was... on the verge of death?
[3:27:31] <+BubbaRands> The women are malicious on this planet LUL

[3:28:01] <Ruonation> see her lick her lips
[3:28:06] <Ruonation> she parched
[3:28:26] <%impulse255dj> awww. Yeah she died in 1990, aged only 48 :-(
[3:28:27] <xilofone> murdering is hot tho
[3:28:29] <JoshManVGH> So his reward is a dressing down. If he went with mute girl he might have gotten snuu snuu
[3:28:31] <Dunmarkh> @JoshManVGH "I'm sure he'll miss on purpose, to show he's honorable"-
[3:28:36] <stranger59> "An AMERICAN never takes a life needlessly."
[3:28:37] <DimBulb999> get zeta for a threesome
[3:28:41] <xilofone> oh shit
[3:28:47] <JoshManVGH> @dunmarkh LUL

[3:29:08] <%KellBeII> being smol
[3:29:11] <thefishofwar> They lack empathy cause of their tiny hearts
[3:29:14] <xilofone> shes so tiny and just treis to make others tinier
[3:29:20] <+Dakuu75> teaching these aliens about "Man-Splanning"
[3:29:25] <Presence_Eternal> dun dun dun
[3:29:26] <%Bigchill___> he forced him self on me
[3:29:27] <stranger59> Is she being sinister or is that just how she talks?
[3:29:43] <%Heart0fInk> Oh Plague. everyone knows women can't kill
[3:29:46] <+BubbaRands> kinda hot ngl Kappa
[3:30:04] <+Dakuu75> he brought the knife out for the lols
[3:30:19] <+tussletoes> "Don't worry, women can't kill" sounds like something a woman about to kill me would say.
[3:30:32] <+ItalianWaifu> hey bro check out this cool knife i have also i have a plan
[3:30:42] <+tussletoes> big needs for big meats
[3:30:46] <%ralphwiggum16> If you think the story is so stupid Eli, WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A BETTER ONE?!?!
[3:30:55] <thefishofwar> I'm starting to get really annoyed by the constant and unchanging space theremin music
[3:30:56] <%Explodincatz> fuck yea shrinking AND inflation
[3:31:02] <xilofone> love OMEGALUL
[3:31:18] <JoshManVGH> So if one of them steps inside his ship, they become this planets equivalent of a Kaiju. Seems like a thing that would be handy
[3:31:27] <stranger59> I don't think he's alone just 2 nights a week...
[3:31:29] <%Bigchill___> how would he never know?
[3:31:39] <%Bigchill___> He could just go looking for him or his ship and they're gone
[3:31:45] <thefishofwar> "the space alarm!"
[3:32:02] <stranger59> They could all live on one pizza roll
[3:32:33] <stranger59> "I have no time to explain" is my favorite line from TROS
[3:33:00] <%Bigchill___> SpAaAaAaAcE~
[3:33:30] <stranger59> Could a giant Earth person just beat them up?
[3:33:35] <thefishofwar> they're normal sized, it's just cold in space
[3:33:49] <+BubbaRands> Theyre adorable !
[3:33:58] <%Bigchill___> hey look, they have time to explain
[3:34:07] <DimBulb999> nice eyes
[3:34:41] <JoshManVGH> A solid wall... that's also invisible. Isn't science fun!
[3:34:48] <thefishofwar> oho, space foreshadowing
[3:34:51] <stranger59> He could kill us all if he escapes, tee hee!
[3:34:58] <+ThomasOfTroy> If you locked molecules into a solid wall, the wall wouldn't be see-through then
[3:35:36] <%Explodincatz> clearly its a mirror that doesnt shatter
[3:35:37] <Daxalog> I thought that was a cat scream
[3:35:42] <kennethraptor> lol
[3:35:43] <+tussletoes> lmao the yelling
[3:35:45] <thefishofwar> oh god they're space burning to death
[3:35:48] <%PleasantLee> skreeeee
[3:35:55] <stranger59> They're just screaming in fear and pain, there was never an 'attack'
[3:36:03] <+tussletoes> nugget away
[3:36:04] <lewdnekojam> well that was easy
[3:36:08] <+BubbaRands> @ThomasOfTroy shhhhhhh don't ruin our science with science
[3:36:16] <%Explodincatz> they just wanted mercy killings
[3:36:16] <thefishofwar> This is the worst kfc ad I've ever seen
[3:36:22] <%Bigchill___> thats just how they talk
[3:36:24] <+tussletoes> it's so funny to half-watch this movie. what the fuck is happening
[3:36:24] <+ThomasOfTroy> @BubbaRands no u
[3:36:28] <DimBulb999> we just want to use the rest room
[3:36:43] <%Bigchill___> @tussletoes watching it fully wouldn't explain any more
[3:36:46] <%PleasantLee> "good shot, tacticle. Comms, are they screaming?" "yes captain, like frighten pigs"
[3:36:54] <+tussletoes> as i feared...
[3:37:24] <%Bigchill___> they have the ultra super mega space laser
[3:37:26] <%Bigchill___> as I feared
[3:37:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> I mean, those ladies WERE super hot for murder
[3:37:37] <+BubbaRands> BATTLE OH JOY
[3:38:03] <+ThomasOfTroy> Also, is it just me, or does the planet/asteroid just look like fried chicken
[3:38:09] <$SGrim> If they have universal gravity control, why not use the mass of the enemy ships to crush those inside?
[3:38:23] <%PleasantLee> sounds like they're using space winchesters
[3:38:25] <arussoltzm> Was it just me or did the fire people look a bit like magmar
[3:38:27] <+tussletoes> man the boulders! aim! fire!!!
[3:38:35] <DimBulb999> gunshot sounds in space

[3:39:01] <+ThomasOfTroy> I'm actually enjoying this movie, and not just because it's bad
[3:39:14] <Daxalog> This is the craziest run of FTL ive seen.
[3:39:14] <lewdnekojam> a literal cosmic shot
[3:39:17] <stranger59> That's a great pilot
[3:39:18] <%Bigchill___> wub wub wub wub
