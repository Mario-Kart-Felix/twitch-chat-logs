[0:02:02] <+JantDarvus> oh god a facecam i was not prepared for this
[0:02:06] <xxshadowxx416> you had hair what
[0:02:09] <j0ustar> oh no
[0:02:12] <Triblade1992> hello. Heard that REmake 3 was rushed out due to trying to ride on the coat tails on REmake 2. Good thing I went with FF7R instead
[0:02:50] <+JantDarvus> Okay so is this just you watching the news, Plague, or...?
[0:02:52] <xxshadowxx416> re 3 was good it more acton
[0:02:53] <NickHatesSnow> Howdy folks
[0:03:17] <%Rezca> oh my
[0:03:36] <j0ustar> The only thing I feel rushed in this game is the last sequence imo other than that it's pretty solid
[0:03:46] <Triblade1992> Is this a recreation of the Chinese government lying about how they could have prevented the Corona Virus?
[0:03:56] <NickHatesSnow> I really dig this cutscene reminds me of the OG resident evil opening
[0:04:11] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> aww yeah plague stream
[0:04:13] <+FunkyRot> heyyo hello
[0:04:23] <+FunkyRot> i didnt know there was a stream
[0:04:27] <extradopeness> Hey all you cool cats and kittens
[0:04:30] <+patriotrenegade> Oh boy are you in for it
[0:04:38] <+JantDarvus> I genuinely thought Jill had fuzzy vision from just waking up until I realised your facecam is also blurry so it's just the stream
[0:04:48] <xxshadowxx416> side story good for dlc
[0:05:09] <Triblade1992> Remake 3 was only rushed out to ride on the wave of REmake 2. They can't hide behind that excsue.
[0:05:21] <villainous_quel> ^

[0:05:25] <+FunkyRot> porn
[0:05:27] <Garden_Hills> I went to Art school
[0:05:28] <%Rezca> it says overpriced
[0:05:30] <Futurecity10> It saying to kill my wife
[0:05:37] <Triblade1992> at least FF7R being "Midgar Section The Game" is something that almost happened in the original FF7
[0:05:37] <YoOctober> mercenary mode would be nice
[0:05:39] <ElkRiverDog> I see bars
[0:05:41] <+jacewolf_is_the_best> the rising of the coomer
[0:05:43] <DillionPHCO> DillionPHCO subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! plagueChirei
[0:05:44] <NickHatesSnow> I looks like Jazz
[0:05:51] <extradopeness> It says 60 USD
[0:06:18] <Triblade1992> It just looks like a window with curtains. The circle being someone looking out of the window
[0:06:18] <NickHatesSnow> It just makes me think of Pink Panther
[0:06:23] <TomFrank> hey plagues face
[0:06:28] <approachingdeath> Asymmetrical symmetry
[0:06:30] <CraftofPaper> I like da ball
[0:06:39] <%Rezca> is this better or worse than talking about bricks?
[0:06:42] <DillionPHCO> What does it MEAN
[0:06:45] <digitaljeff> I like when the colors look good
[0:06:48] <TomFrank> Kreygasm
[0:06:50] <extradopeness> looks like it could be cover art for an obscure ambient album
[0:06:53] <Triblade1992> the fan too

[0:07:16] <CraftofPaper> You can close the window for no reason if you’d like

[0:07:37] <Presence_Eternal> It's important to keep your crazy conspiracy wall cooled off.
[0:07:37] <digitaljeff> You know I expected Plague to look more Plaguey
[0:07:42] <Triblade1992> ew

[0:08:22] <Futurecity10> Camisole?
[0:08:25] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> i wonder how good he is at timed dodging
[0:08:35] <DillionPHCO> The T in T Virus means Tree, the mystery is solved

[0:09:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Who is this 4chan
[0:09:15] <SilverRoddo> I guess i’ll draw Jill in that sweater blouse shirt, thing.
[0:09:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Does it say something about me that the most effective art critique to stay in my memory is the Strong Bad one where he teaches you to draw Trogdor?
[0:09:16] <cap_bon> buppy
[0:09:30] <extradopeness> Buppy doge

[0:10:38] <SilverRoddo> BLÜD
[0:10:40] <Triblade1992> Nice work developers
[0:10:41] <Presence_Eternal> It's the scary scene from Poltergeist.
[0:10:42] <DillionPHCO> Oh no! Not the Covids!
[0:10:43] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "It's a metaphor for childbirth."
[0:10:46] <extradopeness> Is she okay?
[0:10:47] <Presence_Eternal> Time to rip your face off.

[0:11:06] <ElkRiverDog> Ya didn’t social distance did ya?
[0:11:11] <Oleai> She's got a lil bit of that PTSD from Zombie House
[0:11:12] <DillionPHCO> It was all a dream
[0:11:17] <+NYCrownlessKing> CHRISSS
[0:11:23] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> why because it always has a predictable ending when dream sequences are involved?
[0:11:23] <digitaljeff> Its the PTSD
[0:11:25] <ThatGuyThere03> after RE1, probably
[0:11:25] <SilverRoddo> That is some Eternal Darkness tech.
[0:11:26] <extradopeness> Is that CHRIS
[0:11:34] <+NYCrownlessKing> of course PTSD, she was in a fucking mansion surrounded by zombies plague lol
[0:11:35] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Post Arklay PTSD
[0:11:39] <Triblade1992> Doggos are good
[0:11:41] <xxshadowxx416> you will
[0:11:41] <ThatGuyThere03> I have seen that dog picture somewhere else before
[0:11:42] <StonerStan101> Sorry.
[0:11:42] <scottishwolf> What about Zombie Puppers?
[0:11:44] <+zestyArsenic> carlos is a good dog
[0:11:45] <%Rezca> zombie puppos
[0:11:46] <EuropanLamprey> I've got some bad news Plague
[0:11:47] <YoOctober> hggMuffin hggGun hggGasm
[0:11:51] <digitaljeff> Hey its that dog
[0:11:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> a dog
[0:11:55] <cap_bon> No magic just vocal cord parasites
[0:11:57] <tolloponik> there's a cat corps somewhere
[0:12:01] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Just don't go to the bathroom yet to look at all the things
[0:12:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> oh no
[0:12:09] <+FunkyRot> an entire town worth of puppos gets evaporated
[0:12:10] <+whiskey_wolfe_> They ... all get away.
[0:12:12] <ThatGuyThere03> there are dogs you can interact with
[0:12:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> But the zambambos dogs
[0:12:24] <+RPG_CHICAGO> no LIVE doggos...
[0:12:28] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes you've never played any RE games have you?
[0:12:32] <Oleai> All the dead puppies died of happiness and overeating, completely unrelated to the apocalypse.
[0:12:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> It probrably was fast
[0:12:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> tbh
[0:12:57] <SilverRoddo> RalpherZ FrankerZ OhMyDog
[0:12:59] <Garden_Hills> someone ate a crow
[0:13:08] <YoOctober> isnt there like...only 4 dogs in the game?
[0:13:10] <DillionPHCO> Is that the first time they've ever called them Zombies in these games?
[0:13:11] <+RPG_CHICAGO> This is just what they've witnessed after the first game
[0:13:12] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> rats too they are what caused the spread
[0:13:13] <EuropanLamprey> I appreciate they just come out and call them zombies instead of avoiding the word like so many other works
[0:13:14] <+logoth_> Dr Phil
[0:13:14] <+whiskey_wolfe_> In fact they promod RE2make with a rat's eye view
[0:13:16] <DillionPHCO> I've never seen them say that
[0:13:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Goddamn raccoon city folk eating crows
[0:13:17] <SilverRoddo> crowreCaw crowreCaw crowreCaw
[0:13:24] <+sourceofall> well Jill isn't a scientist she probably just didn't think it all the way through
[0:13:30] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Irishmen
[0:13:32] <ThatGuyThere03> horses eat people?
[0:13:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> But crows fly fast
[0:13:37] <%Rezca> wait... Deer and Horses eat carrion?
[0:13:37] <+RPG_CHICAGO> HORSES ARE MONSTERS
[0:13:39] <Triblade1992> onmivores?
[0:13:40] <cap_bon> been seein a fair few rats waltzin around the streets since the lock down
[0:13:41] <Oleai> All "Herbivores" are opportunistic omnivores.
[0:13:41] <extradopeness> The Amish
[0:13:41] <approachingdeath> INFECTED ANTS/FLIES
[0:13:42] <Garden_Hills> The fuck
[0:13:44] <xxshadowxx416> what
[0:13:44] <TomFrank> like a baby?
[0:13:45] <SilverRoddo> Wumbuses?
[0:13:46] <+logoth_> Just like people
[0:13:48] <EuropanLamprey> Ever see the video of that Horse eating that baby chick
[0:13:50] <NickHatesSnow> That's rad
[0:13:51] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I took this as her just listing a few examples
[0:13:54] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> horses do that?
[0:13:55] <ElkRiverDog> Corvids and vultures
[0:14:03] <StonerStan101> There is a once a while thing when horse go and hunt after something.
[0:14:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Horses are assholes
[0:14:06] <Oleai> I've seen deer eat birds
[0:14:07] <+Peterbyte_> Okay I've literally just got here and already I've heard too much
[0:14:07] <YakumoYomi> I didn't even know horses ate mice.
[0:14:08] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> i thought they were herbivores
[0:14:09] <+DakotaMacDoodle> Rats are how it spread in raccoon city
[0:14:09] <+EyeFarted> Saw a clip of a horse eating a baby chick.
[0:14:10] <approachingdeath> Horses are scum
[0:14:11] <lambishly> Yet
[0:14:14] <ElkRiverDog> Elk do that too
[0:14:17] <NickHatesSnow> Horses are cool
[0:14:18] <Garden_Hills> I hate geese more
[0:14:22] <TomFrank> zombie horse is an idea capcom has never tried
[0:14:23] <Daxalog> Isnt that so they can make mares ready to mate again?
[0:14:25] <YakumoYomi> But centaurs, tho...
[0:14:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> goddamn
[0:14:30] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes I mean they planned to make zombie horse, but that was canned.
[0:14:32] <EuropanLamprey> Chirp chirp chirp chirp - *silence*
[0:15:04] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[0:15:12] <cap_bon> Carnivore horses would be horrifying
[0:15:21] <ElkRiverDog> Yes
[0:15:23] <+sal00nn> Oh no, I now know what plague looks like. The illusion is broken.
[0:15:24] <s1rcuit> yes
[0:15:26] <Oleai> RE2 and RE3 happen concurrently.
[0:15:27] <+EyeFarted> @EuropanLamprey No it's chirp chirp *crunch* *silence*
[0:15:29] <ThatGuyThere03> RE2 happens a few days from now at the precinct
[0:15:30] <sniffy77> I feel like special cop forces screaming about a zombie mansion would of been national news.
[0:15:33] <+RPG_CHICAGO> RE3 technically starts before 2
[0:15:34] <lambishly> Re 3 is like roughly the same week
[0:15:35] <+sourceofall> this start before RE2 but ends after it
[0:15:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> pretty much
[0:15:39] <Oleai> RE3 begins before RE2, and ends after RE2
[0:15:40] <+RPG_CHICAGO> and ends after 2
[0:15:43] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes RE1 was the Manshion. RE2 takes place in the same city Jill is in. They are just hours apart.
[0:15:45] <s1rcuit> I think RE2 happens like a day after RE3 in the timeline
[0:15:47] <+Heart0fInk> RE2 isn't happening yet
[0:15:49] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> i think its 1 hour or 2 between re3 and re2
[0:15:51] <CraftofPaper> It’s ok, it’s only game
[0:15:51] <ThatGuyThere03> somewhere in the midwest
[0:15:52] <+Heart0fInk> almost tho
[0:15:53] <ElkRiverDog> RE2 takes place in the middle of 3.
[0:15:53] <StonerStan101> Midwest
[0:15:53] <+RPG_CHICAGO> "MIDWEST"
[0:15:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> they happen at the same time
[0:15:54] <+EyeFarted> Montreal
[0:15:56] <+Functional_Platypus> Midwest city
[0:15:57] <Oleai> "Mid-west"
[0:15:57] <NickHatesSnow> Montreal
[0:15:57] <KatabolicRage> Raccoon is a "midwest valley city" of vagueness
[0:15:58] <+arancet> "midwest" is all we got
[0:16:00] <lambishly> It's moved a few times
[0:16:01] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I imagine it somewhere near Illinois
[0:16:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:16:03] <sniffy77> Northern Midwest I think.
[0:16:05] <+RPG_CHICAGO> It's Chicago now
[0:16:07] <YakumoYomi> Kansas?
[0:16:09] <+sourceofall> soemwhere it can be nuked without anyone knowing it had been nuked somehow
[0:16:13] <+clayisack> I thought midwest
[0:16:14] <+EyeFarted> hehehe
[0:16:14] <lambishly> Japan doesn't know what the midwest is
[0:16:18] <s1rcuit> I want to say towards the Rockys
[0:16:23] <KatabolicRage> some kinda midwest mountanious area
[0:16:23] <+clayisack> Not really
[0:16:26] <TomFrank> yea i think its colorado
[0:16:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Speaking as a forriner, the American Midwest is what - like Kansas, right?
[0:16:32] <+sourceofall> are the Arklay mountains a real mountain range?
[0:16:32] <TomFrank> near the rockies
[0:16:36] <+RPG_CHICAGO> SD Perry novels had it more in mid-Pennsylvania
[0:16:36] <EuropanLamprey> It's next to Springfield
[0:16:39] <cap_bon> Its located in Nowhere not to far from Courages farm
[0:16:41] <lambishly> Kansas sucks I grew up there
[0:16:43] <Humantrollerkaathe> Alot of fans say Springfield missouri
[0:16:57] <+lethallylactic> ZOMBIE POPE
[0:16:58] <+RPG_CHICAGO> BIG BLANKS
[0:17:03] <SilverRoddo> RaccAttack
[0:17:08] <+kiwiredgrave> Devil May Cry. Pope May Visit
[0:17:09] <lambishly> RE can't happen in Kansas because there's no mountains
[0:17:11] <+FrenchTact1cs> I forget how handsome plague is
[0:17:12] <Oleai> The Pope did a big Pope Speech inside a big glass box to an empty audience.
[0:17:13] <+SaphronBlackbourne> If only the pope came and you had to kill the zombified pope
[0:17:20] <cap_bon> me pope me want visit racoon
[0:17:27] <YakumoYomi> I think it's officially an "isolated mountain town in the midwestern United States"
[0:17:31] <digitaljeff> PokGardevoir FortOne
[0:17:31] <TomFrank> yea
[0:17:33] <KatabolicRage> seem sso
[0:17:35] <+RPG_CHICAGO> This is Jill
[0:17:36] <Oleai> This is Jill.
[0:17:38] <ClammShells> On google maps Raccoon city is actually in Kentucky!
[0:17:40] <%zk_nails> he patched unbathtized babies out of hell
[0:17:42] <cap_bon> That wasnt the pope Oleai that was a bloodborne boss
[0:17:46] <+RPG_CHICAGO> STARS = SWAT
[0:17:48] <YakumoYomi> SWAT
[0:17:48] <NickHatesSnow> swat team
[0:17:50] <+dylin456> chris wrote this I think
[0:17:51] <ElkRiverDog> Yes is Jill
[0:17:53] <KatabolicRage> Stars is some kinda bizarre "elite" force cross between swat and mountain rescue
[0:17:53] <digitaljeff> Theyre just SWAT
[0:17:53] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes STARS is super swat.
[0:17:54] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Fancy SWAT
[0:17:55] <Oleai> Special Tactics and Rescue Service. Basicly The RPD's SWAT team.
[0:17:56] <Humantrollerkaathe> Stars is like super swat team
[0:17:59] <+SaphronBlackbourne> It was a small town but they seemed to retcon it into a large city later on
[0:18:00] <+FrenchTact1cs> Fancy swat
[0:18:01] <+clayisack> super swat
[0:18:09] <ElkRiverDog> Yes
[0:18:10] <j0ustar> Ok you're going into this SUPER DRY huh
[0:18:10] <TomFrank> jill is salty she got fired so shes investigating herself
[0:18:12] <StonerStan101> RPD has SWAT team, and STARS is above them.
[0:18:14] <SilverRoddo> BEAS.T.A.R.S
[0:18:14] <+FrenchTact1cs> They are FANCY swat
[0:18:17] <+clayisack> because they are supoer
[0:18:17] <ThatGuyThere03> STARS was an emergency unit that was actually a cover for research on infantry vs bioweapons
[0:18:18] <ClammShells> It's not the swat... It's the SUPER swat
[0:18:19] <xxshadowxx416> they found ot first
[0:18:19] <Humantrollerkaathe> kinda its a pmc swat thing
[0:18:20] <digitaljeff> Theyre super ELITE SWAT
[0:18:21] <sniffy77> They're super cops
[0:18:22] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Part of cops but higher level
[0:18:24] <Jaller101514> Special Tactics And Rescue Squad
[0:18:26] <%Rezca> post Resident Evil, they are going incognito I guess
[0:18:26] <s1rcuit> STARS is LIKE SWAT not actual SWAT
[0:18:27] <Oleai> Because they encountered zombies and the their own police department denied it - then fired them. So they're looking into it solo.
[0:18:38] <ThatGuyThere03> Also Jill was Special Forces before the age of 23 somehow
[0:18:40] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Pepperoni pizza and a bowl of onion soup, like Americans like.
[0:18:42] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Umbrella trying to silence them since they escaped
[0:18:48] <+Heart0fInk> Jill has cheese pizza on her computer?
[0:18:48] <digitaljeff> They're like detectives but cooler
[0:18:50] <+Heart0fInk> OH!
[0:18:55] <+Heart0fInk> Actual pizza...
[0:18:58] <digitaljeff> ara ara
[0:18:58] <cap_bon> jill sandwich
[0:19:02] <+Heart0fInk> nevermind...
[0:19:03] <Shardlab> They got sent in, got too deep in a covered up outbreak, and found out too much
[0:19:07] <ThatGuyThere03> Well they weren't really SWAT
[0:19:08] <xxshadowxx416> yes
[0:19:09] <+FrenchTact1cs> Remember they are Japanese
[0:19:12] <+RPG_CHICAGO> pretty much
[0:19:14] <+Crimznking> hey everybody
[0:19:15] <Humantrollerkaathe> That asshat Brad is the guy who left everyone in the woods while he was safe in his chopper
[0:19:17] <+RPG_CHICAGO> JAPAN
[0:19:18] <NickHatesSnow> like swat/fbi
[0:19:20] <+sourceofall> special tactics and rescue squad
[0:19:21] <KatabolicRage> they're a cross between swat and mountain rescue, with an emphasis on ELITEness and wearing their fancy custom uniforms
[0:19:24] <TomFrank> special operations like rescuing people
[0:19:24] <+Jumpie8> fuckin Brad
[0:19:24] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes they're like special forces search and rescue
[0:19:25] <EuropanLamprey> It's a team of super cops, that's all it is
[0:19:26] <%Rezca> their members are REALLY elite
[0:19:30] <Jaller101514> Theyre a Super Cop Squad
[0:19:31] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes They are the Super Swat team.
[0:19:32] <+RPG_CHICAGO> YES
[0:19:34] <%zk_nails> its a Capcom story, they never make sense
[0:19:34] <NickHatesSnow> yes
[0:19:34] <+lethallylactic> Yes
[0:19:35] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah
[0:19:37] <digitaljeff> Thats what it is
[0:19:37] <+Jumpie8> yes
[0:19:38] <extradopeness> It’s not really SWAT they’re just supercops
[0:19:38] <+clayisack> yup
[0:19:39] <+RPG_CHICAGO> YESSSSSS
[0:19:40] <+dylin456> yep

[0:23:06] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Men, amirite?
[0:23:07] <NickHatesSnow> @EyeFarted I'm Canadian and I hate it
[0:23:12] <extradopeness> The fact it looks like a jug of bleach really alarms me more than the idea of Raccoon Milk
[0:23:14] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> before you had to have a scene where they have to explain why you can't have cell phones
[0:23:18] <arkv01> SHTARS
[0:23:19] <%zk_nails> Tom Nooks "milk"
[0:23:20] <+RPG_CHICAGO> @PatStaresAt but psaBig

[0:23:32] <NickHatesSnow> Breadboxes are super useful
[0:23:34] <arkv01> if he'll forgive me debt, I'll drink all his milk...
[0:23:35] <arran_throttle> wait, Plague has a body!?
[0:23:39] <+FrenchTact1cs> Surely this door will stop him
[0:23:41] <%Rezca> Homemade masks are better than nothing

[0:23:43] <+lethallylactic> YEET
[0:23:48] <cap_bon> it always mazes me to see characters still walk after being hit hard enough to be taken off their feet
[0:23:49] <ThatGuyThere03> warning labels
[0:23:49] <SilverRoddo> I wish he had a glittery stormtrooper helmet on
[0:23:53] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Warning tape
[0:23:53] <Djinnazz> caution tape
[0:23:57] <+Heart0fInk> I had to drink Tom Nooks milk to pay off my house...

[0:24:25] <+sourceofall> shits been popping off for hours and jill just didn't notice
[0:24:29] <+EyeFarted> He was in the boy scouis
[0:24:29] <Garden_Hills> No QTE
[0:24:34] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Then you won't be disappointed Eli
[0:24:34] <lambishly> Jills apartment complex has been on fire for 2 days
[0:24:36] <+FrenchTact1cs> Hentime
[0:24:37] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes you clearly underestimate the flammability of modern infrastructure
[0:24:43] <Mr_Wankman> That was a lot of ass in that shot
[0:24:43] <arkv01> jill's liver should've been ruptured the first time she got bodied
[0:24:47] <NickHatesSnow> Jill's fire detector is busted
[0:24:50] <SilverRoddo> He’s magic, he can cast fire? CurseLit
[0:25:02] <+EyeFarted> Any succulents?
[0:25:04] <+Th3SmartAlec> WELL BE RIGHT BACK

[0:25:13] <jiin6> Safety's hilarious
[0:25:14] <+FrenchTact1cs> Lotta wall burtsing
[0:25:15] <lambishly> having plants on the escape
[0:25:26] <arkv01> cmon nemesis if you've got her by the head, give her a hug too
[0:25:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Just like Brock Samson
[0:25:29] <+RPG_CHICAGO> That's the carborator
[0:25:46] <Samsaz> very convenient
[0:25:50] <SilverRoddo> I like these DoA stage transitions
[0:25:52] <DillionPHCO> So much rebar

[0:26:38] <extradopeness> Brad “True Hero” Vickers
[0:26:47] <+Binary_Fireball> its almost like people didnt stay inside
[0:26:48] <+Th3SmartAlec> Brad: "Wait! Don't go!"
[0:26:50] <Samsaz> I dont think the fires are all because of him
[0:26:56] <digitaljeff> Dont ask questions
[0:26:59] <Djinnazz> It's been like 4 days of esculation.

[0:27:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I love when car pileups just perfectly block streets like that.
[0:27:10] <NickHatesSnow> Jill is a VERY deep sleeper
[0:27:16] <+Pyr0_Fr0st> Socal Distancing gone wrong

[0:28:51] <Garden_Hills> Rubble, the new invisible wall
[0:28:52] <+arancet> on fire rubble

[0:30:03] <DillionPHCO> Costumes has been added...
[0:30:07] <%JJCheeker> hello people
[0:30:16] <nesbitt22> I hate runnning Zombo
[0:30:17] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> back when zombies became Nazis
[0:30:19] <+Binary_Fireball> the slow invincible zombies are best
[0:30:25] <+FrenchTact1cs> Jason?
[0:30:25] <+thackattack00> slow zombies are great
[0:30:25] <Triblade1992> You mean like how that one PS4 Zombie game everyone recently forgot about?
[0:30:27] <lambishly> He's tired
[0:30:28] <arkv01> very big tired murderer :(
[0:30:31] <Humantrollerkaathe> i liked the re2 method of we put 6 zombies on screen, it will never get better than this
[0:30:33] <GanktheGoat> that was a zombie? i thought it was a typical highschooler?
[0:30:35] <+Binary_Fireball> it allows tension to build
[0:30:36] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> a murderer but very lazy lol
[0:30:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Classic zombies lasted in a way that classic monsters didn't.
[0:30:43] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> It hsa a lot to do with how much stuff you can render on screen.
[0:30:43] <GarbageNirvana> The Dead Rising games were always good for that if nothing else
[0:30:44] <blightblues> better shot him to be safe
[0:30:44] <Enshrouded> Waddling away aggressively
[0:30:45] <YakumoYomi> Zombies sprinting is against the natural order
[0:30:49] <+Binary_Fireball> inside the gamer cube
[0:30:55] <arkv01> jill you fool, helicopters are a deathtrap in real time gameplay
[0:30:59] <EuropanLamprey> Part retreats to his cube
[0:30:59] <ThatGuyThere03> it is till it isn't
[0:31:00] <extradopeness> Safe inside his cube
[0:31:02] <lambishly> Something that is slow and unstoppable is scarier than something fast but very killable
[0:31:12] <cap_bon> Every time you go through a door I expect you to turn around to rubble LUL
[0:31:13] <+ThatButler> Somehow it feel slike every zombie could be avoided if you carried around a bunch of pocket jerky.
[0:31:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "Hoisted by my own petaaaaaaard~"
[0:31:17] <arkv01> SIR STOP RESISTING

[0:32:12] <Huntercd> Jill wuff wuff
[0:32:12] <Mr_Wankman> It's got to be an old refrigerator.
[0:32:14] <+Binary_Fireball> inside a pillar of a big building
[0:32:18] <Humantrollerkaathe> underground science lab?
[0:32:22] <ThatGuyThere03> I told you there would be dogs
[0:32:22] <circular7> a mine?
[0:32:23] <ComfyFox> gonna bite your butt
[0:32:25] <+arancet> jills languid escape
[0:32:25] <+Th3SmartAlec> No wait, the canon answer is a helicopter LUL
[0:32:27] <cap_bon> racoon city has alot of dobermans huh
[0:32:33] <GanktheGoat> Most bank vaults are thick enough and deep enough to survive the blast
[0:32:47] <arkv01> I dunno man, you'd need a HEAVILY lead fortified shelter to protect you from a nuke
[0:32:49] <extradopeness> Dobermans are always the SCARY dog
[0:32:52] <Triblade1992> Not really. Many of them are boring.
[0:32:54] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> I think the tops of buildings are under-rated. You can defend corridors, hop from building top to building top, form bands of survivors.
[0:32:55] <DehiDehi> No zombie shiba inus
[0:32:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah how
[0:33:01] <Fenlig> Slow moving Zombies are a great game mechanic
[0:33:02] <ThatGuyThere03> rats
[0:33:03] <Garden_Hills> IT was in the air
[0:33:04] <stfn893> Zombies are fun until they are filler
[0:33:05] <Djinnazz> lol
[0:33:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> wait for it
[0:33:08] <AnacondaVirtue> But Plague, humans are the REAL MONSTERS!!!
[0:33:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> rats we are the rats
[0:33:09] <+FrenchTact1cs> Went back and turned
[0:33:09] <jsikandere> a rt bit his toe dont think about it
[0:33:10] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He stuck his hand out to pick up someone's money.
[0:33:15] <circular7> he's very committed to the job Kappa
[0:33:20] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> He's not bitten, he's just on meth.
[0:33:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:33:28] <ThatGuyThere03> it has been at least a day man
[0:33:29] <arkv01> what can I say, jill is a big napper :)
[0:33:30] <+RPG_CHICAGO> Scratched lightly but still went to work
[0:33:30] <TechDragon_Z> It's been going on for a few days, Jill is on house arrest if I remember
[0:33:31] <+Binary_Fireball> jill is super late to the pandemic game
[0:33:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:33:32] <extradopeness> Yeah that’s just Terry
[0:33:33] <cap_bon> what a hero going to work during a zombie pandemic
[0:33:36] <Humantrollerkaathe> One of the fandom things that drive me insane is the difference between zombie dogs and a cerberus. the deciding factor is was it turned by a syringe i guess
[0:33:38] <lambishly> ADHD zombies
[0:33:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> But they like banging the fance
[0:33:42] <+arancet> then low frame animations get really bothersome in this game
[0:33:49] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah it wasn't minutes bro
[0:33:55] <TomFrank> shift is run space is dodge
[0:33:55] <+Binary_Fireball> you have that dash
[0:33:57] <Enshrouded> Just a lil peck
[0:33:58] <ComfyFox> shift for run, space for dodge
[0:34:01] <EuropanLamprey> it's been hours, Jill literally slpet through the apocolypse
[0:34:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> I believe it's over like 2 weeks, but Super escalated like the past day.
[0:34:03] <stfn893> Idk how quick you have to mash or its just useless
[0:34:06] <Daxalog> It sowed you how to run when you were looking at jesus
[0:34:08] <+FrenchTact1cs> I think wed make it out of an actual zombie outbreak
[0:34:20] <Huntercd> People are stupid this could happen in days
[0:34:20] <GanktheGoat> so are they actually biting her or just near miss?
[0:34:28] <ThatGuyThere03> they are actually biting
[0:34:34] <EuropanLamprey> non-canon bites
[0:34:37] <+FrenchTact1cs> I think the bites arent canon
[0:34:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Huntercd Having an infection and not informing others about it? Who would do that?
[0:34:46] <koffeemancer> theyre biting but non cut scenes bites dont count
[0:34:47] <arkv01> just lil love nibbles
[0:34:49] <hypersongi> learn to dodge. time it right and its effective
[0:35:23] <+Th3SmartAlec> @koffeemancer I believe this game implies that people with resistance to the virus can take a bite or two.
[0:35:29] <Huntercd> All bites non canon except for like one
[0:35:40] <SilverRoddo> Don’t toggle your crouching. Kappa
[0:35:54] <arkv01> all the protags have a layer of slime that protects them from bites
[0:35:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> correct
[0:35:55] <ComfyFox> how lucky that the elevator door just opened 2 inches
[0:35:58] <Humantrollerkaathe> if i remember right its like 1/10000 are immune to the t virus, but when a zombie is chewing on your guts, genetic immunity doesn't mean shit
[0:36:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> Well game's over, nice job
[0:36:05] <Triblade1992> Could have had some kind of cure syringe but NOOOOO
[0:36:08] <EuropanLamprey> The canon Doom story is the Speedrun
[0:36:10] <koffeemancer> @Th3SmartAlec True but the heros dont get bitten in canon i believe
[0:36:11] <Triblade1992> non canon bits
[0:36:13] <GanktheGoat> oh the helicopter blow up
[0:36:14] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I prefer crouch toggle
[0:36:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> well
[0:36:18] <+FrenchTact1cs> First chopper has to die. Its the rules.
[0:36:18] <+whiskey_wolfe_> whaaaat nooooo
[0:36:22] <TomFrank> you called it
[0:36:25] <cap_bon> also they are completely immune to normal infections from all the sewer water the walk through
[0:36:26] <lambishly> surely a helicopter 11 minutes into a videogame will be fine
[0:36:26] <+Binary_Fireball> just stay in the car dont try to drive
[0:36:30] <%Mr_y1096> they do not swallow a SINGLE cums
[0:36:30] <KatabolicRage> the game would be really short of it didn't blow up
[0:36:32] <jiin6> Called it
[0:36:32] <+Binary_Fireball> just wait
[0:36:34] <arkv01> jill has eaten SO much shit, she shouldn't be able to move
[0:36:34] <stfn893> Its me the trashman
[0:36:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> Gas gas gasssssss
[0:36:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sorry for what
[0:36:42] <+Binary_Fireball> it is
[0:36:44] <+Binary_Fireball> ahhhh
[0:36:45] <ComfyFox> thats ethan's car from RE7 LUL
[0:36:45] <SilverRoddo> Plot car
[0:36:50] <ComfyFox> or atleast the same lookin
[0:36:57] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "It's Becky, bitch"
[0:36:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> BAD DECISIONS
[0:36:58] <+nooseygoosey> god i wish that were me
[0:36:59] <blightblues> oh no he's going to do sick donuts
[0:37:01] <jiin6> RE7
[0:37:01] <Huntercd> Buckle up kids
[0:37:02] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes That car is the same car that you drive up in on RE7 so this existence creates a tme paradox
[0:37:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> I'm gonna take you for a ride!
[0:37:03] <GanktheGoat> When did Nemesis get into BDSM?
[0:37:06] <hypersongi> All helicopters are explosive. Its a fact.
[0:37:10] <+TQuick101> He looks like Juggernaut
[0:37:16] <GanktheGoat> He looks like a gimp
[0:37:17] <jsikandere> now he really DOES have a car engine in his chest
[0:37:17] <TechDragon_Z> No air bags? Unsafe vehicle
[0:37:21] <+Binary_Fireball> mummy dude
[0:37:26] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah like the guy from Kenshin
[0:37:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> @hypersongi Resident Evil helicopters are narrative glass cannons
[0:37:29] <+nooseygoosey> curse sealing?
[0:37:29] <+arancet> buddhist mummy?
[0:37:29] <DehiDehi> No seat belt
[0:37:30] <arkv01> he's a ninja in training
[0:37:30] <extradopeness> She called him a bitch tho that must have hurt his feelings
[0:37:30] <EuropanLamprey> Japanese Vampire
[0:37:31] <jiin6> Shaman?
[0:37:32] <arkv01> garbage ninja
[0:37:34] <s1rcuit> it's ghianghi or something like that
[0:37:38] <Huntercd> she should be dead
[0:37:40] <kronostorm34> Soul Eater?
[0:37:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> staaaaars
[0:37:46] <YakumoYomi> Jiangshi is Chinese, though
[0:37:51] <circular7> that was all the dangerous Jill
[0:37:51] <arkv01> that tentacle tho
[0:37:51] <+Binary_Fireball> Anima was my intro to that "style"
[0:37:52] <s1rcuit> some sort of Chinese ghost/vampire
[0:37:53] <Make_me_mad> Nemesis in this game is like Doomsday from the old DC comics.
[0:37:54] <stfn893> Look at my beautiful teet
[0:37:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> That tentacle is dexile
[0:37:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[0:37:54] <%Rezca> Lots of people in masks at WalMart
[0:38:03] <Make_me_mad> Starts off wrapped in a containment suit that gets stripped off as you go.
[0:38:03] <Humantrollerkaathe> its not as cool as the same scene in terminator 1 im sorry
[0:38:05] <arkv01> Squid1 Squid1
[0:38:09] <lambishly> he's tired
[0:38:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> reasons
[0:38:12] <InfamousShephard> dont worry about that
[0:38:13] <+thelonechris> Shhh
[0:38:14] <+thackattack00> it was on cooldown
[0:38:15] <ThatGuyThere03> because Carlos
[0:38:15] <arkv01> his tentacle was on cooldown
[0:38:18] <lambishly> ^
[0:38:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> shhhhh
[0:38:19] <+FrenchTact1cs> Hes a lazy murderer
[0:38:21] <Garden_Hills> He wanted to feel the big rocket
[0:38:22] <%Rezca> Why is Carlos increadibly Hot?
[0:38:25] <YakumoYomi> He wanted to look cool for Jill
[0:38:27] <Triblade1992> Nemesis isn't at all smart Plague
[0:38:27] <EuropanLamprey> Because the second one had sexual energy covering ti
[0:38:32] <Daxalog> Mana was low
[0:38:33] <blightblues> he's secretly rooting for you to survive
[0:38:33] <circular7> lol
[0:38:33] <+Lost_Zombie> sometimes you just wanna know how much damage something does
[0:38:33] <Humantrollerkaathe> i mean the tyrant from Re1 can backhand a rocket out the way
[0:38:34] <extradopeness> He noticed how hot Carlos was
[0:38:36] <cap_bon> grrr I hope that helped set the mode
[0:38:37] <SuperVaderMan> He learned from Mr. X and didn't explode into gore from that rocket
[0:38:42] <arkv01> I mean this was a ps1 game
[0:38:42] <+BioHunter> pacing is too fast
[0:38:42] <+Binary_Fireball> pacing is much faster
[0:38:43] <jiin6> Carlos and his non military haircut
[0:38:43] <TomFrank> i agree
[0:38:43] <Fenlig> Dudes wearing a wig
[0:38:45] <TechDragon_Z> No, pacing is really fast in the remake
[0:38:46] <%Rezca> 6 Feet
[0:38:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Accept the Carlos hug Jill
[0:38:55] <arkv01> YO I'D WATCH THAT
[0:38:57] <+Binary_Fireball> oh do you care about bobbleheads?
[0:38:57] <+arancet> its a prequel
[0:38:57] <Huntercd> UBCS has weird uniform regs
[0:38:57] <Garden_Hills> total Alien rip off
[0:38:58] <Humantrollerkaathe> id watch that movie
[0:38:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> This game's pacing is arguable too rushed
[0:39:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hell Suid Zeeeero
[0:39:03] <stfn893> You go through 45-1hr of re3 in 15 minutes
[0:39:05] <YakumoYomi> The Origin Story of Hell Squid!
[0:39:08] <ThatGuyThere03> they're a private force iirc
[0:39:10] <arkv01> hellsquid sounds rockin Squid1
[0:39:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:39:18] <+FrenchTact1cs> Lot of horror movies
[0:39:21] <Triblade1992> They are all references to old 90's movies
[0:39:23] <lambishly> Ask yourself that of our world Plague
[0:39:32] <Humantrollerkaathe> like Back to the future 2 and 3
[0:39:34] <arkv01> is that just jinroh?
[0:39:35] <+Th3SmartAlec> That's a bold move
[0:39:36] <+eanscrale> double feature?
[0:39:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Skull Talkers are reruns
[0:39:39] <Humantrollerkaathe> back to back
[0:39:41] <Daxalog> Pokemon Blue, Pokemon red
[0:39:41] <extradopeness> That’s a t-1000
[0:39:45] <jiin6> Double feature
[0:39:46] <EuropanLamprey> Leveloids
[0:39:47] <+FrenchTact1cs> It could be some double feature grindhouse thing
[0:39:50] <YakumoYomi> Mad Balls!
[0:39:56] <Triblade1992> I think it's a reference to that B movie about killer Tomatoes
[0:39:58] <seth45er> yeah mad balls!
[0:40:03] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> @plagueofgripes critters
[0:40:03] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Boglins?
[0:40:03] <NickHatesSnow> yeyeye
[0:40:10] <Humantrollerkaathe> i might remember that
[0:40:10] <asurite_warrior> Oh yeah I was a real little kid at the time
[0:40:10] <EuropanLamprey> You mean Leviloids?
[0:40:18] <asurite_warrior> some had their brains come out
[0:40:22] <extradopeness> Mad Balls were those awful collectible things yeah
[0:40:27] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> the monster furry ballz is critters
[0:40:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> How you do not know your bosses are evil Carlos
[0:40:30] <arkv01> oh yeah, the poop toys
[0:40:31] <rothgarbloodfire> oh god its his face! his beautiful face.
[0:40:34] <Humantrollerkaathe> yes i remember those
[0:40:34] <TomFrank> i never squeezed mad balls :)
[0:40:36] <+Th3SmartAlec> New dialouge!
[0:40:37] <jsikandere> jill cannot even
[0:40:38] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah like Boglins.
[0:40:38] <SilverRoddo> Bleetz Bols?
[0:40:38] <arkv01> poop comes outta their ass and slurps back in
[0:40:44] <extradopeness> Off that GPK vibe
[0:40:51] <+eanscrale> I blame the success of the garbage pail kids
[0:40:54] <+arancet> pfft what haircuts
[0:40:54] <+kiwiredgrave> or lack thereof
[0:40:56] <+nullC> Gak. Creepy Crawlers. Boglins.
[0:40:58] <+Th3SmartAlec> Okay. Fun fact, there's hidden dialouge
[0:40:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jill accept Carlos Brazilian charisma and excuses
[0:41:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> E
[0:41:12] <Triblade1992> Mega man!
[0:41:13] <jiin6> Dino BITE
[0:41:18] <+Th3SmartAlec> yeah
[0:41:19] <stfn893> DOnt worry
[0:41:20] <+Binary_Fireball> JUST meg man?
[0:41:20] <jiin6> Smalls
[0:41:25] <SuperVaderMan> Megaman is Capcom
[0:41:25] <+arancet> i wonder if long hair is gonna become a trend after covid keeps everyone from going to the barber...
[0:41:25] <YakumoYomi> Bad Box Art Mega Man
[0:41:25] <+thackattack00> bad box art megaman
[0:41:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Man Capcom better sue these guys.
[0:41:27] <BananaAssasine> what up boomers
[0:41:28] <Triblade1992> There is a store later on with Megaman. And a LOT OF HIM
[0:41:28] <arkv01> sure why not LUL
[0:41:36] <NickHatesSnow> yup
[0:41:37] <Humantrollerkaathe> bad boxart megeman is the best
[0:41:39] <+Th3SmartAlec> Zombies are CANON
[0:41:44] <+kiwiredgrave> they buy groceries
[0:41:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:41:48] <stfn893> Is that charles the third
[0:41:49] <TomFrank> RE: Zombies are comin to town
[0:42:02] <Humantrollerkaathe> its like a hunter xenomorph
[0:42:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> Last car
[0:42:04] <arkv01> in the subway
[0:42:04] <YakumoYomi> Zombies. They come to town. Come to save! The Princess Zelda!
[0:42:10] <GanktheGoat> So they have the concept of Zombies but had no way of telling what was happening in Raccoon city until it was too late?
[0:42:10] <+JamesCorck> Plague is baffled by the concept of Easter eggs.
[0:42:11] <%Rezca> Is Tales From the Crypt still going on?
[0:42:16] <sniffy77> I like that they actually say zombie, and not tip toe around the word.
[0:42:24] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes that got me harder than it should have
[0:42:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> new lactation
[0:42:29] <+arancet> you owuld
[0:42:31] <arkv01> the raccoon milks gotta come from somewhere
[0:42:41] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[0:42:42] <Humantrollerkaathe> wait a minute did Easter happen already?
[0:42:44] <+Th3SmartAlec> Does... that make Jill a captain?
[0:42:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> The berret symbolizes authority
[0:42:49] <+kiwiredgrave> uh oh, plagues going to borderline porn of the silhouette alien girl
[0:42:49] <+thackattack00> nah Easter is this Sunday
[0:42:55] <Humantrollerkaathe> ok
[0:42:57] <YakumoYomi> "New lactation" is on brand for this content creator
[0:43:01] <+GenesisKnight> Umbrella hires from all over the world
[0:43:02] <ThatGuyThere03> because he's privately contracted
[0:43:05] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He works for a private company Eli.
[0:43:08] <Humantrollerkaathe> i thought i had finally lost track of time
[0:43:09] <KatabolicRage> my russian friend pointed out this guy has two first names
[0:43:11] <jsikandere> i miss old shitty dialogue this new shitty dialogue no good
[0:43:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean when the soviet union fell a lot of military guys were out of a job
[0:43:25] <Enshrouded> Looks like they've rescued plenty, why the train is bopping
[0:43:27] <Huntercd> Umbrella recruits Europeans for most of their jobs
[0:43:29] <+Th3SmartAlec> Jill is so done with this
[0:43:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mercenary work kind of made sense
[0:43:31] <+sourceofall> Japan had weird ideas about how american corporations worke
[0:43:35] <jiin6> Umbrella and its diversity hires in the 90's
[0:43:37] <+forgetme000> why does he have two first names?
[0:43:39] <Triblade1992> @jsikandere I think the problem is that this game got rushed out. REmake 2 didn't have this problem
[0:43:42] <+whiskey_wolfe_> This city has so many amenities for 100,000 people.
[0:44:01] <+whiskey_wolfe_> A fucking subway.
[0:44:02] <extradopeness> HEY!! A GUY!,
[0:44:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> 1000000 people and they have metros
[0:44:04] <+GenesisKnight> More like 5
[0:44:05] <Futurecity10> like 6
[0:44:06] <suikudo> 5
[0:44:06] <Huntercd> This game isn't rushed
[0:44:08] <arkv01> yea, leon and leon
[0:44:09] <ThatGuyThere03> 4-8
[0:44:10] <sniffy77> Eh, 4ish
[0:44:10] <TechDragon_Z> Less than a hundred
[0:44:12] <jiin6> Like7
[0:44:13] <dracovastor> 6
[0:44:14] <Triblade1992> 5-6 people
[0:44:16] <Futurecity10> Leon, Sherry, Claire, Carlos, Jill
[0:44:17] <Shardlab> Less than ten
[0:44:19] <TechDragon_Z> Forgot the official number
[0:44:19] <+BioHunter> the outbreak too as well
[0:44:20] <suikudo> Claire sherry Lean Carlos and Jill
[0:44:21] <%Gogogolem> Seven i think?
[0:44:22] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> 6-9 people
[0:44:22] <ThatGuyThere03> and Hunk
[0:44:23] <asurite_warrior> more get out but like I think 1 in 10 of the cities population dies
[0:44:23] <dracovastor> hunk!
[0:44:27] <%Rezca> does the online one count?
[0:44:28] <arkv01> this isn't even a bathtub!
[0:44:30] <+kingboro> if you count outbreak
[0:44:30] <+Th3SmartAlec> Depending on when. Some Outbreak characters survive, so probably 1000 at MOST
[0:44:35] <cap_bon> so are those like regular ass civilians or like umbrella corp employees
[0:44:37] <+GenesisKnight> Six people you care about
[0:44:41] <YakumoYomi> Jill, Leon, Carlos, Claire, Sherry...who am I missing?
[0:44:48] <dracovastor> hunk
[0:44:48] <ElkRiverDog> Ada
[0:44:52] <+sourceofall> Ada
[0:44:52] <+whiskey_wolfe_> "I know what a radio is!" Jill said, overcompensating.
[0:44:52] <asurite_warrior> only a few Characters
[0:44:58] <asurite_warrior> survive
[0:45:02] <sonofthedeepsouth> And nobody in the american media ever asked what happened to raccoon city
[0:45:05] <jsikandere> nice
[0:45:06] <arkv01> give us your MILKIES
[0:45:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...they were wearing gloves
[0:45:11] <Humantrollerkaathe> i remember there are like military checkpoints and it confuses me how in the hell Leon and Claire made it into the city with all this shit going down
[0:45:13] <GanktheGoat> nah they used forks and knives
[0:45:17] <Triblade1992> See what I'm talking about when I say "rushed out"?
[0:45:21] <Enshrouded> What about the mini ones above the seats?
[0:45:22] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> lactate all day everyday
[0:45:22] <arkv01> well, he is
[0:45:23] <+kiwiredgrave> Zombies come to town. Jaunch mortars
[0:45:23] <jsikandere> just spreading the good word about public breastfeeding is all
[0:45:26] <+BioHunter> alyssa i believe canonically survives
[0:45:28] <jsikandere> japan is ahead of us
[0:45:31] <blightblues> in the end that's what's really important
[0:45:35] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes That's Dr. Light And Wily
[0:45:41] <SuperVaderMan> :|
[0:45:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:45:47] <arkv01> oh, of course
[0:45:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> super fighting robot
[0:45:56] <blightblues> we have to stop dr wiwi
[0:46:02] <+Th3SmartAlec> Megaman is fictional...but Dr Light is canon
[0:46:02] <sosuke5> JUST mega-man
[0:46:09] <YakumoYomi> W-Megaman
[0:46:11] <Triblade1992> The amount of Megaman "references" are WAAAAY too much in the beginning
[0:46:14] <ThatGuyThere03> no Carlos just wrote this
[0:46:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Mercenary
[0:46:15] <Humantrollerkaathe> PMC
[0:46:22] <+walternatorz> what you don't see is it's in comic sans
[0:46:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> just 2 gunpowder
[0:46:29] <cap_bon> just compress gunpowder in your hands to make bullets
[0:46:32] <arkv01> it leads me to believe all the megaman posters are foreshadowing for a reboot
[0:46:34] <+forgetme000> next mega-man games gonna be in the RE engine lol
[0:46:34] <+Binary_Fireball> why cant you just use 1 gunpowder?
[0:46:34] <SuperVaderMan> Just rub the gunpowders together and out comes the bullets :)
[0:46:35] <blightblues> and apparently the casing is included
[0:46:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Salt peter what is that shut up
[0:46:39] <+Th3SmartAlec> ...I'm such an idiot. I completely forgot about the MAG ammo
[0:46:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Casings???
[0:46:42] <ThatGuyThere03> headspace is a myth I tell you
[0:46:43] <Fuji_Apples> hahaha
[0:46:46] <Humantrollerkaathe> Umbrella must make a shitload of money off their drugs to afford all this shit
[0:46:47] <+arancet> crush it in your fist into a bullet
[0:46:49] <+crimsonharvest> like you do, just sitting on its little paper square
[0:46:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Just gunpowder
[0:46:54] <Enshrouded> Just a pinch of gunpowder, lightly season
[0:46:55] <SilverRoddo> Maybe they are setting up a Mega Man reboot. HahaThink
[0:46:56] <YakumoYomi> Megaman Legends 3 in RE engine could be sick...
[0:47:01] <suikudo> At least in the original game she had a reloading tool
[0:47:02] <jiin6> Smoosh it into bullet SMOOSH IT GOOD
[0:47:03] <NeonBleu> i thought you press it really hard to form the shell.....
[0:47:04] <wagasez> legit lold at this idea
[0:47:06] <WierdDino> who is this handsome man i see on my screen?
[0:47:13] <TomFrank> not a lot of mag ammo
[0:47:15] <peachteagaming> chad ammo
[0:47:20] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> When they try to make silly game elements diegetic, they kind of lose me.
[0:47:20] <GarbageNirvana> Didn't people make saltpeter from pissing on hay
[0:47:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Humantrollerkaathe They most have sold bootleg BOWS to somebody for overpriced
[0:47:21] <arkv01> @YakumoYomi I'm thinkin about it and getting very excited
[0:47:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> KOL
[0:47:30] <GarbageNirvana> or something
[0:47:33] <rubbishbinge> big capital letters for big ammo
[0:47:40] <SilverRoddo> Nyotengu?
[0:47:50] <jiin6> Fish heads got the best bits
[0:47:50] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> It was okay.
[0:47:51] <xxshadowxx416> ska
[0:47:56] <arkv01> 90s is dumb fun music, 80s is true patrician taste
[0:48:00] <+Binary_Fireball> whats your favorite genre?
[0:48:05] <+whiskey_wolfe_> A familiar Japanese name: KOL
[0:48:05] <peachteagaming> 90's Death metal is okay
[0:48:06] <GarbageNirvana> Some of it's good
[0:48:11] <asurite_warrior> For me there was some BIG hits but mostly misses
[0:48:12] <+forgetme000> I was 2 at this tme
[0:48:13] <Humantrollerkaathe> @Th3SmartAlec but thats another thing no one knows bows exist yet. this is like a new development
[0:48:14] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> You mean like today?
[0:48:14] <YakumoYomi> I was born in 84, and most of my music appreciation comes from the beep-boops of NES and SNES games
[0:48:15] <+sourceofall> I was born in 1990, but I like 80s music and classic rock
[0:48:15] <+crimsonharvest> I'm only a year older, there wasn't a lot to envy in music at the time unless you were a michael jackson fan
[0:48:16] <+SaphronBlackbourne> Synths are good fucka u
[0:48:16] <Huntercd> Tears for Fears was good
[0:48:19] <theaudacityofthisb> nice shirt
[0:48:22] <xxshadowxx416> but the ska
[0:48:28] <+whiskey_wolfe_> In Ireland we had Britpop. Oasis, Blur.
[0:48:29] <ECRead> Nirvana is about it for me, and that was early
[0:48:34] <SilverRoddo> You’re crazy Eli, Smashing Pumpkins / were / are still great.
[0:48:35] <GarbageNirvana> '90s hip hop was fun
[0:48:41] <arkv01> britpop's the good shit
[0:48:41] <NickHatesSnow> the 90's is easily one of the worst decades of music.
[0:48:52] <theshillman> Resident Plague
[0:49:00] <jiin6> Too sexy for my shirt was my bane in da 90's
[0:49:03] <blightblues> a horse probably did it
[0:49:05] <Humantrollerkaathe> I don't know i feel like they should be playing Celine Deione over all the radios
[0:49:09] <asurite_warrior> @PlagueOfGripes You cant tell me a guy like you doesnt love him some ska man
[0:49:11] <KatabolicRage> I dunno, being bitten by a human is arguably worse than a dog, humans carry human diseases
[0:49:14] <arkv01> mmmm MANs butt
[0:49:19] <peachteagaming> MAN MEAT
[0:49:20] <jiin6> Mutant horses
[0:49:22] <ChetTheRipper> Man steak Kreygasm
[0:49:24] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Humantrollerkaathe the public, yes. but otherwise the canon plays real loose with how often different viruses get passed around different facilities (granted, this is moreso after Raccoon City)
[0:49:27] <+Crimznking> that's called burying the lead Plague
[0:49:32] <YakumoYomi> Man meat if FILTHY, tho...
[0:49:35] <extradopeness> Whoa Ska fans in chat DansGame
[0:49:44] <StrawberryLion> Plague looks awefully happy today, what's wrong?
[0:49:54] <NickHatesSnow> the only genre that thrived in the 90's was hip-hop and even then there was so much bad songs from the genre
[0:50:04] <arkv01> this box will steal your soul ScaredyCat
[0:50:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> Good ol RE7 boxes
[0:50:17] <+Crimznking> thrash metal in the 90's
[0:50:18] <KatabolicRage> not gon knife the obvious box?
[0:50:19] <arkv01> not since globalization
[0:50:19] <+Th3SmartAlec> RE8 desperately needs to make new assets
[0:50:30] <sosuke5> something something music theory. I don't know
[0:50:33] <InfamousShephard> """puzzle"""
[0:50:34] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes jam your gun in it
[0:50:34] <YakumoYomi> The prevalence of the internet probably had a hand in that
[0:50:38] <jiin6> Knife da box
[0:50:41] <+Binary_Fireball> colonization unified a lot of music with western bullshit
[0:50:44] <blightblues> knife is always the answer
[0:50:46] <+sourceofall> it happened before the internet
[0:50:46] <Humantrollerkaathe> @Th3SmartAlec I mean that it appears nobody has ever used the bows before. wouldn't it be really obvious if a bunch of reptile men slaughtered an entire platoon in combat?
[0:50:48] <theshillman> use GUN
[0:51:00] <peachteagaming> Clown Fart Music
[0:51:06] <+SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[0:51:07] <jsikandere> i dont like player characters with personality
[0:51:12] <TomFrank> where are the old sound effects? re3 had em
[0:51:14] <PabuPanda> You gotta play Bejeweled to open that damn thing.
[0:51:15] <arkv01> you put the herb into the pipe... and light it FeelsGoodMan
[0:51:15] <Humantrollerkaathe> Not really puzzle but a fancy key
[0:51:16] <TomFrank> re2 *
[0:51:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:51:34] <Huntercd> Drugs
[0:51:38] <NickHatesSnow> LUL
[0:51:40] <theshillman> here in the big leagues we cook our own meth
[0:51:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah fuck field medics and all
[0:51:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Humantrollerkaathe That's fair.
[0:51:46] <NickHatesSnow> Mix your weed
[0:51:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> Field Medics what are those??
[0:51:58] <PabuPanda> In the Big Leagues, we are all alchemists.
[0:52:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> No blue herbs this game
[0:52:08] <NickHatesSnow> sticky icky and thaat skunk weed
[0:52:09] <xxshadowxx416> yellow
[0:52:10] <TomFrank> yellow
[0:52:10] <suikudo> Yello1
[0:52:11] <+thackattack00> and yellow
[0:52:12] <approachingdeath> Sounds like Somali child soldiers league
[0:52:12] <sniffy77> Yellow and blue
[0:52:14] <arkv01> Atelier Jill
[0:52:14] <+Th3SmartAlec> RE4 is yellow
[0:52:15] <+sourceofall> blue was for poison
[0:52:17] <Humantrollerkaathe> yes
[0:52:22] <TechDragon_Z> Yellow are in 4 and... I think the Resistance game that was packed in this
[0:52:22] <+forgetme000> it was blue green in this game originaly
[0:52:22] <Huntercd> yellow for europe
[0:52:26] <TomFrank> red looks kinda purple now
[0:52:26] <Djinnazz> Purple
[0:52:27] <asurite_warrior> I remember a white herb
[0:52:27] <DillionPHCO> Imagine joining a police squad and they're all going "Yeah we make/mix our own drugs"
[0:52:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Blue for poison but not here
[0:52:38] <extradopeness> Here in the BIG LEAGUES we starve if we don’t hunt and gather our own goods
[0:52:38] <+sourceofall> sweet sciency magic
[0:52:39] <suikudo> Wait no i remember yellow being in the original RE3
[0:52:39] <theshillman> mix gunpowder and cocaine to make you child soldiers strong
[0:52:44] <+Functional_Platypus> Dont forget yellow box
[0:52:46] <+Th3SmartAlec> The T Virus is so dumb once you realize the herbs are canon
[0:52:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean if raccoon city had this miracle herbs why wasn't umbrella selling this miracle plant for the world
[0:52:56] <Humantrollerkaathe> i keep thinking its the same music as re2r
[0:53:08] <s1rcuit> imagine how much tougher b.o.w.'s would be if Umbrella focused more on herb research
[0:53:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> I have a green herb that can cure Zambies
[0:53:13] <+sourceofall> thats because the locations are basically completely different from the original
[0:53:22] <+Master_Quincey> the music budget went into resistance Kappa
[0:53:25] <PabuPanda> Of course it doesn't ring any bells. You ain't in the clock tower.
[0:53:30] <arkv01> do we taunt the dead with F?
[0:53:31] <+Th3SmartAlec> @s1rcuit Cultivate herbs into Senzu Beans for your BOWS
[0:53:32] <TomFrank> yea the original re3 had a lot more sets
[0:53:35] <milk2b> save music is pretty much the same as original
[0:53:51] <DillionPHCO> I've never seen someone put WASD as AWDS before
[0:53:58] <extradopeness> Press F to disrespect
[0:54:04] <cap_bon> jesus does the T-virus turn zombie skulls into concrete
[0:54:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> @cap_bon I know right
[0:54:14] <peachteagaming> RUN! RUN LIKE A PUSSY!
[0:54:15] <s1rcuit> @Th3SmartAlec not even RE5 had an aerosol
[0:54:17] <PabuPanda> You can't taunt the dead. They have no feelings. Screw 'em.
[0:54:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pretty much I think
[0:54:27] <Humantrollerkaathe> re3 was the 2nd re game i played and the first original style and i'll just say it it was not memorable
[0:54:35] <hypersongi> Dodge through them like a pro.
[0:54:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> People shit on 9mm but you ain't walking after one enters your head
[0:54:42] <+Binary_Fireball> slow burn
[0:54:44] <+Master_Quincey> it's moving too slowly
[0:54:46] <Humantrollerkaathe> then i played remake and im like this is way better
[0:54:47] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> aiming for the legs seems more optimal than the head
[0:54:50] <Triblade1992> Go into the store Plague
[0:54:50] <EuropanLamprey> It looks slow
[0:54:53] <TomFrank> youre noticing the small pattern it has
[0:54:53] <SilverRoddo> CurseLit CurseLit
[0:54:54] <PabuPanda> That fire would like fine if you stood in it.
[0:54:56] <Chatterbox1991> you wanna see weird framerate fires go play Bishock 1 again
[0:55:04] <asurite_warrior> can you knife them
[0:55:20] <+Binary_Fireball> knife is trash
[0:55:23] <+Binary_Fireball> super trash
[0:55:38] <%Rezca> what a potty mouth
[0:55:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:55:39] <TomFrank> knife is useful for floor zombies
[0:55:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Carlos really wants some of that jill ass
[0:55:54] <+Th3SmartAlec> It's funny, later in the game you'll be running through fire that bad
[0:55:57] <theshillman> needs CRANK
[0:56:01] <Aussie_Manny> Get a dog to pee on it.
[0:56:10] <cap_bon> quick check to make sure to see if the fire is hot
[0:56:11] <+walternatorz> how considerate
[0:56:16] <Triblade1992> go into the store Plague. it will be funny to see your reaction
[0:56:16] <+Master_Quincey> it did it's best Kappa
[0:56:18] <TomFrank> it was only a matter of time
[0:56:19] <xxshadowxx416> Carlos know what sex not like chris
[0:56:19] <+Th3SmartAlec> It's trying its best ok
[0:56:25] <Aussie_Manny> nomnom
[0:56:27] <s1rcuit> that was NOT designed to keep them out
[0:56:28] <asurite_warrior> melee combat plague
[0:56:36] <theshillman> if only there was a RED BARREL you could use for ARE DAMAGE
[0:56:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> bye jill

[0:56:50] <TomFrank> LUL
[0:56:51] <Aussie_Manny> Mouth lasers.
[0:56:54] <+forgetme000> lol
[0:56:59] <theaudacityofthisb> it's now annoying
[0:57:00] <cap_bon> I think its the exact moment they attack you get the good dodge
[0:57:00] <+Risingxiv> timing LUL
[0:57:03] <SilverRoddo> Hitbox, unclear
[0:57:04] <+BigCoffee> I mean you could move
[0:57:06] <Aussie_Manny> Bye, Eli!
[0:57:13] <Aussie_Manny> Hi, Eli!
[0:57:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> This dodge is pretty essental to learn
[0:57:16] <Triblade1992> This game really is showing it's cut corners
[0:57:24] <Triblade1992> Remake 2 didn't show this
[0:57:24] <cap_bon> start*
[0:57:33] <PabuPanda> Just tiger drop them when they attack.
[0:57:41] <+sourceofall> wow, the difference in your health between difficulties is really big
[0:57:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Zombies cant go up stairs got it
[0:57:58] <cap_bon> The game really wants the player to dodge
[0:58:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> Red barrel = explody
[0:58:25] <theshillman> is plague doing like a no boxes run?
[0:58:35] <Aussie_Manny> snort it
[0:58:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> barrel?
[0:58:39] <Aussie_Manny> become gun
[0:58:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> Nope
[0:58:43] <mslizard> Hallo Plague
[0:58:45] <Humantrollerkaathe> is bigboy like a california thing? cuz that shit aint over here
[0:58:46] <milk2b> does not compare to jail zombie
[0:58:53] <Huntercd> Hot zombie isn't is this game it sucks
[0:59:13] <blightblues> the amount of raw gunpowder that is in Raccoon City is crazy
[0:59:14] <rubbishbinge> #1 is pee
[0:59:16] <TomFrank> that was pretty odd
[0:59:22] <Longerbone_ghm> You can just use mousewheel to cycle through
[0:59:25] <+sourceofall> the slots are set to those numbers, you can move them around
[0:59:31] <peachteagaming> you can rebind them?
[0:59:59] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[1:00:01] <ThatGuyThere03> they did
[1:00:07] <arkv01> hey, walmart's cool :)
[1:00:08] <Explodincatz> so Walmart
[1:00:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> They did which is why Bio Weapons don't make any sense
[1:00:16] <Humantrollerkaathe> like uh who makes the baby oil?
[1:00:18] <Triblade1992> nah, it would be china because relavent
[1:00:20] <arkv01> so more like Johnson and Johnson?
[1:00:21] <ThatGuyThere03> well the Bio Weapons were for big dosh
[1:00:22] <blightblues> the R and D department did good work
[1:00:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> The hair product alone would make more money I bet
[1:00:26] <Humantrollerkaathe> Johnson and Johnson thats it
[1:00:28] <ElkRiverDog> So Walmart?
[1:00:29] <ThatGuyThere03> so that Spencer could fund a eugenics program
[1:00:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> @sonofthedeepsouth To be fair, the Umbrella founders are also pyschos
[1:00:44] <DillionPHCO> Best Choice?
[1:00:46] <$doomp12> umbrella also have a private militia
[1:00:47] <arkv01> didn't spencer just want immortality?
[1:00:56] <arkv01> what the hell was he doing with eugenics?

[1:04:01] <milk2b> there's back + stab
[1:04:05] <blightblues> no that's strictly a stabbing knife
[1:04:08] <SuperVaderMan> I guess they learned from RE2 that swipes do too much damage LUL
[1:04:10] <Huntercd> Jill thrusts
[1:04:16] <Aydarkzero> stabby only
[1:04:17] <arkv01> this knife is for stabbing steaks
[1:04:26] <+Th3SmartAlec> You can stab on ground, from behind
[1:04:31] <+sourceofall> boxes
[1:04:33] <Aydarkzero> frame bug LUL
[1:04:33] <+Binary_Fireball> knife is poop
[1:04:34] <ThatGuyThere03> for body checking
[1:04:36] <+sourceofall> its for boxes
[1:04:37] <+Binary_Fireball> poop knife
[1:04:38] <arkv01> maybe its a stealth kill knife?
[1:04:38] <Longerbone_ghm> knives ain't great in this one
[1:04:45] <TomFrank> its easier if they dont have legs
[1:04:54] <Triblade1992> to break crates
[1:04:56] <GanktheGoat> box opener
[1:04:56] <TechDragon_Z> Perfect dodge then knife, otherwise it's just to open boxes
[1:05:00] <SilverRoddo> They have a wide ranged command grab
[1:05:01] <Aydarkzero> i use it the same way i do in re4 on knockdown
[1:05:11] <+Functional_Platypus> Knife breaks yellow boxes
[1:05:11] <Humantrollerkaathe> RE4 was great shoot a guy in the eye, roundhouse kick him, then stab his dick
[1:05:15] <kurejichi> rweakimng Crates + witch tim stabs
[1:05:21] <ThatGuyThere03> seriously, use it to check if something is actually dead
[1:05:21] <theshillman> so we getting feet or?
[1:05:21] <kurejichi> breaking
[1:05:24] <ThatGuyThere03> and opening crates
[1:05:42] <Longerbone_ghm> Capcom saw how the knife was used in the RE 2 remake and though "Nah no more of that"
[1:05:45] <+MrWrann> But not metal boxes, only wood
[1:05:49] <arkv01> boxes are weak to sharp pieces of metal
[1:05:52] <Brunothebodyguard> knife is for gripping skateboard
[1:06:00] <+Th3SmartAlec> also, if you stab on ground, go for legs, not for head
[1:06:12] <theshillman> Plague, try to remember some of the basics of CQC
[1:06:13] <+Th3SmartAlec> RE1 REmake
[1:06:15] <Humantrollerkaathe> REmake 1

[1:07:01] <Triblade1992> LOL
[1:07:03] <Humantrollerkaathe> is it like niquil?
[1:07:03] <ThatGuyThere03> it is
[1:07:06] <mslizard> The crimson heads
[1:07:14] <+thackattack00> we'll remember for you
[1:07:16] <blightblues> and not obvious to any random thief
[1:07:27] <SuperVaderMan> I hate that headshots don't even make zombies flinch
[1:07:27] <Piemono> 937
[1:07:29] <arkv01> chat memorize it, we'll be plague's code bank
[1:07:30] <ThatGuyThere03> try shooting their legs
[1:07:31] <Triblade1992> 9 right, 3 left, 7 right
[1:07:31] <Huntercd> Why is she wearing stockings with a swimsuit?
[1:07:31] <SilverRoddo> Pharmacy Queen
[1:07:32] <+Th3SmartAlec> The no staggering is a fair complaint
[1:07:34] <theaudacityofthisb> he's definitely getting up
[1:07:46] <EuropanLamprey> *plague is typing*
[1:07:47] <Brunothebodyguard> 937 on a cop
[1:07:47] <Humantrollerkaathe> oh they are like steroid juice
[1:07:50] <arkv01> we gotchu plague, we'll bring it up for ya
[1:07:52] <SilverRoddo> Chat will ‘member
[1:07:53] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PlagueOfGripes I eventually just started firing center of mass at zombies unless they were far away or not moving
[1:08:16] <+DeaconBluesClues> headshots are like, a bonus in my view more than necessity
[1:08:17] <+Th3SmartAlec> Water hydrant thingy
[1:08:37] <theshillman> @PeachSaliva hey peach, what's good in the hood?
[1:08:47] <ThatGuyThere03> yes
[1:08:48] <Triblade1992> LOL
[1:08:48] <arkv01> wow
[1:08:49] <SuperVaderMan> That's the tapeworm storage :)
[1:08:52] <+Th3SmartAlec> When you say it like that...
[1:08:52] <Triblade1992> AMAZING
[1:08:52] <suikudo> Its about to get stupid
[1:08:52] <+DeaconBluesClues> ...yep thats a mental image that didn't occur to me
[1:08:55] <+thackattack00> just put it in your pockets
[1:08:58] <arkv01> magic pocket dimension itembox
[1:09:00] <Huntercd> Just put it in your pocket
[1:09:00] <$doomp12> deep rope jill
[1:09:01] <serpenttucker> Just shove the whole thing up your ass
[1:09:01] <TomFrank> i wonder where she puts it
[1:09:02] <ThatGuyThere03> ...maybe heal
[1:09:03] <theshillman> yup, stores neatly in yyour guts
[1:09:04] <TechDragon_Z> To be fair she rolled it up
[1:09:06] <milk2b> you're missing out on crit head pops tho if not aiming at head
[1:09:11] <arkv01> she's just dragging the firehose behind her
[1:09:21] <arkv01> like a mario raccoon tail
[1:09:25] <cap_bon> rub that gunpowder together until it makes bullets
[1:09:26] <+Blucarot> Hey PLague hows your experience so far?
[1:09:33] <Brunothebodyguard> firehose is a fashion accessory
[1:09:35] <+forgetme000> Big league pokets
[1:09:43] <+DeaconBluesClues> @milk2b yeah but you're missing out on not getting eaten
[1:09:46] <Triblade1992> This isn't an RPG though
[1:09:51] <+Th3SmartAlec> The rules for item size is pretty odd in this game
[1:09:58] <milk2b> @DeaconBluesClues fair
[1:10:06] <arkv01> it's very ps1 item size logic
[1:10:14] <arkv01> don't think about it cause we only have 32mb of RAM
[1:10:27] <SuperVaderMan> Blast the lock off with water PogChamp
[1:10:35] <ThatGuyThere03> because
[1:10:37] <theshillman> use BANANA on the METRONOME
[1:10:39] <+thackattack00> you can reassign them
[1:10:41] <GanktheGoat> who keeps a hand gernade in their locker?
[1:10:42] <Triblade1992> REmake 3 wasn't thought out
[1:10:43] <+dontgiveupskeleton> plague just rebind them
[1:10:43] <+Th3SmartAlec> Plague, you can choose your quick select
[1:10:47] <cap_bon> What subway keeps grenades in their lockers
[1:10:58] <SilverRoddo> I guess i’ll draw Jill with a hose bandolier-wrapped around her.
[1:11:20] <+Th3SmartAlec> Ammo wasted RIP
[1:11:23] <s1rcuit> this guy's clearly crazy since he trusts a picture of a model more than his wife
[1:11:24] <ThatGuyThere03> a magical bobblehead
[1:11:27] <Huntercd> Japanese version of america must have a lot of guns
[1:11:40] <TomFrank> @SilverRoddo ONLY a hose bandolier
[1:11:48] <Triblade1992> extra security
[1:11:51] <SilverRoddo> HahaThink
[1:12:06] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes at least it's not RE6
[1:12:20] <arkv01> we don't talk about RE (redacted)
[1:12:27] <+Th3SmartAlec> "Puzzle"
[1:12:37] <theshillman> Yeah I'd eat one of those
[1:12:38] <Huntercd> Wasted donuts
[1:12:39] <Charlie99993> Oh god, it's his real face
[1:12:40] <TomFrank> t virus donuts
[1:12:45] <SuperVaderMan> Someone spent a good amount of time modeling and texturing those donuts
[1:12:46] <Triblade1992> Kind of have
[1:12:50] <+nooseygoosey> that mug is too tall with too small a handle
[1:12:58] <outis94> i have around xmas
[1:12:58] <insaneintentionsyo> Krispy Kreme though
[1:12:59] <Charlie99993> Is Plague a real human being or something
[1:13:01] <+thackattack00> chocolate ice cream is the worst
[1:13:03] <IntrepidEye> The donuts were modeled better than that coffee maker
[1:13:11] <Garden_Hills> I like chocolate as an accent, not the base
[1:13:11] <ThatGuyThere03> traitors
[1:13:12] <theshillman> plague, you live in the south. isn't that donut central?
[1:13:13] <ZeeJiggle> Well this is Moon's Donuts we're talkin' about, they know what's up
[1:13:13] <+muzzle_roar24> I prefer vanilla
[1:13:14] <%Rezca> I guess he has not bought a full dozen Krispy Kreme donoughts for himself
[1:13:14] <ThatGuyThere03> the lot of you
[1:13:15] <Brunothebodyguard> dunkin or kripsy?
[1:13:15] <SilverRoddo> Don’t shoot locks, the shrapnel will hurt Jill.
[1:13:29] <NickHatesSnow> So a spiced cookie?
[1:13:33] <asurite_warrior> Plagues attitude with most things makes me want to tell him to smile more I dont know.
[1:13:33] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> i'm so hungry now
[1:13:34] <Aydarkzero> do it Kappa
[1:13:36] <cap_bon> So did things break down in a few hours or days in racoon city because the damage and notes make it sound like it happened over days.
[1:13:47] <insaneintentionsyo> peanut butter cookies though
[1:13:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> cookie hipster
[1:13:52] <Garden_Hills> What about ginger snaps
[1:14:01] <+thackattack00> snickerdoodles
[1:14:07] <Brunothebodyguard> snickerdoodle
[1:14:10] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> ginger caramel cookies are amazing
[1:14:10] <+Th3SmartAlec> that's something you can use the knife for
[1:14:24] <NickHatesSnow> these cars are massive
[1:14:31] <seth45er> ANZAC biscuits are great
[1:14:40] <s1rcuit> I hate macadamia cookies
[1:14:43] <seth45er> if there soft
[1:14:54] <Brunothebodyguard> shortbread cookies are pretty flame
[1:15:00] <insaneintentionsyo> plague wants that zombie box
[1:15:08] <cap_bon> excuse me sir but could you please at least stagger when I shoot your indestructible skull
[1:15:17] <seth45er> sweet chili and peanut are nice
[1:15:29] <NickHatesSnow> seriously every care is taller or as tall as jill wtf?
[1:15:33] <NickHatesSnow> car
[1:15:45] <asurite_warrior> @PlagueOfGripes did your parents also put nuts into everything?
[1:15:51] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> snickerdoodle is just a fucking sugar cookie, how deprived are you in hicotwn?
[1:15:59] <SilverRoddo> So, no Pocky?
[1:16:00] <Humantrollerkaathe> I actually really like oatmeal raisin cookies
[1:16:05] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:16:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:16:11] <arkv01> peanut butter if you've all been good boys and girls :) :)
[1:16:13] <s1rcuit> I like oatmeal cookies, I don't like oatmeal raisin
[1:16:13] <Brunothebodyguard> you don't got the multitude of trollhouse
[1:16:14] <asurite_warrior> I got lucky with my hometown it was rural but like an hour away from a city
[1:16:20] <GanktheGoat> planking zombie
[1:16:22] <arkv01> nutella if you've been REALLY good boys and girls
[1:16:29] <Aydarkzero> he's vibin
[1:16:31] <Brunothebodyguard> cardio zombie
[1:16:35] <Charlie99993> uh oh
[1:16:39] <mslizard> Easter cookies ?
[1:16:45] <+Th3SmartAlec> ayyyy
[1:16:51] <arkv01> you got [DRAGON DILDO]
[1:16:52] <insaneintentionsyo> banana ice cream is my favorite
[1:16:59] <+Th3SmartAlec> PISTOL
[1:17:04] <Charlie99993> Huh, I entered it a different way
[1:17:09] <%Rezca> can't let my wife find out I am a gun nut
[1:17:09] <LunarRemix> Not even a pistol?
[1:17:10] <asurite_warrior> put on gun
[1:17:12] <TomFrank> combine with handgun
[1:17:13] <LunarRemix> Just an attachment?
[1:17:29] <Humantrollerkaathe> is this guy from the south? cuz a laser dot sight being your treasure sounds about right in that case?
[1:17:34] <+Th3SmartAlec> You can
[1:17:42] <+PR0swagonist> Hi plague
[1:17:45] <arkv01> combine firehose with gun
[1:17:51] <arkv01> hydro blast
[1:17:53] <+Th3SmartAlec> Hose
[1:17:55] <TomFrank> fire alley
[1:18:00] <IntrepidEye> Convenient he just happened to have a red dot sight compatible with that type of glock
[1:18:05] <GanktheGoat> intelligent inventory design in a resident evil game is asking too much
[1:18:06] <+MrWrann> Why it wasn't a laser sight instead of a red dot is odd
[1:18:07] <SilverRoddo> Alittle o dis, little of that, there, dakka SMOrc
[1:18:08] <+Th3SmartAlec> don't worry about that
[1:18:09] <Charlie99993> Do you think we don't have every single piece of gun anything that can be got in the south?
[1:18:16] <TechDragon_Z> Hose will work
[1:18:18] <ZeeJiggle> Nah Jill will just use her massive muscles
[1:18:20] <TheZearGuy> Don’t overthink it
[1:18:20] <Humantrollerkaathe> use your super jill strength
[1:18:26] <insaneintentionsyo> we all know you're using the nude mod off stream
[1:18:27] <+dontgiveupskeleton> the game completely overlooks
[1:18:28] <Huntercd> Jill has gorrilla strength
[1:18:32] <arkv01> jill can bench 500 easy
[1:18:36] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @PlagueOfGripes My lord your wastelings have arrived
[1:18:39] <Humantrollerkaathe> who needs a wrench to turn a valve when you have jill hands
[1:18:41] <Brunothebodyguard> sorry plague but krunk is dead
[1:18:52] <ZeeJiggle> Dude, my grandma had one of those
[1:18:53] <+nooseygoosey> someone modeled that
[1:18:57] <ZeeJiggle> can confirm, was creepy
[1:19:03] <+Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:19:03] <insaneintentionsyo> lol
[1:19:04] <Humantrollerkaathe> jester or harlequin?
[1:19:05] <TomFrank> rip
[1:19:07] <ComfyFox> that thing was in re2 remake too
[1:19:10] <Huntercd> creept clown was in RE 2 remake as well
[1:19:10] <milk2b> rude
[1:19:18] <insaneintentionsyo> "no stories"
[1:19:34] <Humantrollerkaathe> why does everyone in the city have to be rude as shit i swear
[1:19:52] <Humantrollerkaathe> that sounds hilarious
[1:20:03] <theshillman> ah, a portal to a horror movie
[1:20:10] <theshillman> 死
[1:20:13] <%Rezca> taxidermy and art dont seem to go together
[1:20:15] <s1rcuit> HMMMMMMM MMMMMEEEEEE
[1:20:19] <GanktheGoat> jill sandwich
[1:20:20] <SilverRoddo> Mortis
[1:20:22] <+plus_on_black> I guess that is one Slay Fox huh?
[1:20:31] <+nathandiel> Wow Plague is bad!
[1:20:37] <Humantrollerkaathe> oh my
[1:20:39] <Futurecity10> you didnt save
[1:20:41] <+Th3SmartAlec> Not quite
[1:20:42] <blightblues> yay check points
[1:20:46] <aeravon> SO maybe use the green herb when you hit red and then dont die
[1:20:50] <theshillman> plague contemplates death
[1:21:01] <theshillman> missed loot
[1:21:02] <seth45er> what part of the neck is the part that is like a steak?
[1:21:02] <SilverRoddo> Speedrun it, play a song?
[1:21:07] <GanktheGoat> hey you know the code now atleast
[1:21:10] <TomFrank> 937
[1:21:13] <TheZearGuy> Could lower difficulty I guess
[1:21:20] <Humantrollerkaathe> damn i didn't think the checkpoints were that wide apart
[1:21:21] <+nathandiel> Imagine Nemesis with boobs
[1:21:27] <Aydarkzero> is he on normal?
[1:21:37] <theshillman> if you dont get angry after a loss, you already lost twice.
[1:21:42] <+nathandiel> Play assisted
[1:21:43] <Garden_Hills> Ninja would disagree
[1:22:22] <theshillman> you want to be like big stream daddy ninja, right plague?
[1:22:23] <+dontgiveupskeleton> play assisted with infinite rocket launcher
[1:22:34] <TomFrank> or dodge, dodging is fun
[1:22:41] <arkv01> Jill is the city hunter
[1:22:43] <Huntercd> They give you plenty of ammo
[1:23:04] <s1rcuit> zombie cop: sssstooooppp resistinnnnnnnng
[1:23:09] <GanktheGoat> Check the donut shop?
[1:23:38] <theshillman> plague got that old man aim
[1:24:52] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Infinite ammo place the difficulty on killiing the enemy, not on having shit and conserving resources.
[1:25:04] <Garden_Hills> Im the kind of person to use Cheatengine to have fun
[1:25:12] <Triblade1992> I like the game to have tough but fair difficulty. I only play the hardest difficulty (ME2 Insanity mode or Witcher 3 highest difficulty) to get the last trophy for the plat
[1:25:23] <TheZearGuy> I hear ya. It would be a better game if it didn’t have enemies. Totally agree.
[1:25:52] <Triblade1992> 9 right, 3 left, 7 right
[1:25:53] <theshillman> drunk on the job
[1:26:00] <+ThatButler> yes, time stopes
[1:26:05] <+ThatButler> you enter the Puzzle Dimension
[1:26:15] <GanktheGoat> Matrix zombies
[1:26:20] <theshillman> is the aiming that jank?
[1:26:32] <+nathandiel> Plague is a bad American with that aim
[1:27:40] <CandyCoatedConfection> doughnut shop has a save room
[1:28:48] <arkv01> sure you can, it's all magnets!
[1:28:48] <Amarky> If by cute, your mean cursed. Sure
[1:28:49] <Triblade1992> Resident Evil logic
[1:28:54] <Huntercd> Jill has gorilla strength
[1:28:56] <+MrWrann> She used her huge muscles to open the valve
[1:28:56] <Charlie99993> There's a save room right here
[1:28:57] <+unclekulikov> That's how it works in the city, plague. You wouldn't know.
[1:28:58] <SilverRoddo> Base of the fire, Jill
[1:29:04] <+ThatButler> There you go, expecting things and common sense in zombie game
[1:29:10] <InfamousShephard> Don't those things have a massive kick behind them?
[1:29:18] <+scarletdye> Guess the 90’s fire hydrants were looser
[1:29:34] <Triblade1992> The developers are mocking you
[1:29:35] <arkv01> they do, but jill has baboon strength
[1:29:42] <blightblues> you did it
[1:30:02] <TheZearGuy> Well you don’t HAVE to
[1:30:02] <+nooseygoosey> nope
[1:30:03] <LehranSF> Not the right key item for that
[1:30:04] <blightblues> too strong a lock
[1:30:05] <ThatGuyThere03> not on locks
[1:30:07] <Triblade1992> try the knife
[1:30:08] <+MrWrann> It's for chains
[1:30:13] <ovan20> bolt vutters are for chains
[1:30:13] <arkv01> that bolt is way too thicc
[1:30:15] <GanktheGoat> cut the chain
[1:30:16] <SilverRoddo> No backtrack run, eff it.
[1:30:23] <Triblade1992> it's for the chain
[1:30:26] <+ThatButler> You can't bolt cut a lock with a key on it. That'd be a crime
[1:30:28] <TechDragon_Z> Bolt cutter for chains, lockpick for the locks
[1:30:39] <asurite_warrior> dude the looks big enough to break that cutter
[1:30:44] <Charlie99993> Yeah, it's weird, I tired the same thing
[1:31:02] <Huntercd> She's deaf now
[1:31:04] <SilverRoddo> Oh, it’s the number that appears in media.
[1:31:16] <arkv01> different russian
[1:31:17] <dukenux> thats Nikolai
[1:31:20] <ovan20> this is Nicolai
[1:31:21] <blightblues> different foreign agent
[1:31:23] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes they look alike
[1:31:29] <dukenux> russian Bill stayed on the train
[1:31:48] <ovan20> that wounded soldier is Mikail
[1:31:50] <xxshadowxx416> go back get the shotgun
[1:31:58] <Laecerelius> That guy is the evil Russian not good Bill Russian
[1:31:59] <arkv01> so is mikail bitten?
[1:32:08] <C24U> Biting through clothes doesn't mean body fluids transmitted though
[1:32:18] <SuperVaderMan> So do zombie bites turn you into a zombie in Resident Evil or not? The protagonists get bitten all the time
[1:32:26] <+MrWrann> Oh, he's a D-Class
[1:32:27] <%Gogogolem> Wait twenty?
[1:32:43] <SilverRoddo> He’s the Punisher?
[1:32:55] <%Gogogolem> Thats like too many.
[1:32:55] <dukenux> @supervaderman "canonically" none of the protagonists ever got bitten afaik
[1:33:06] <SuperVaderMan> that's dumb
[1:33:08] <theshillman> does anyone else shave one leg and rub it against the other one while in bed so it feels like you are sleeping with a girl?
[1:33:13] <dukenux> so if you want to pull off a canon run - git gud
[1:33:17] <GanktheGoat> powder
[1:33:22] <TomFrank> save grenades
[1:33:24] <C24U> 10% are resistant/immune to it lore wise
[1:33:29] <xxshadowxx416> gunpower
[1:33:33] <C24U> No
[1:33:34] <ovan20> no yellows
[1:33:35] <LehranSF> No
[1:33:43] <+dontgiveupskeleton> Np
[1:33:49] <LehranSF> The ranks are only time-based
[1:33:49] <dukenux> there's a scoring system?
[1:33:50] <Huntercd> Its all time based
[1:33:51] <ovan20> scoring is based on game time and number of saves
[1:33:52] <C24U> S rank is 5 save max
[1:34:01] <MrHappyFunshine> Gunpowder i'd say
[1:34:04] <dukenux> oh riiight
[1:34:15] <Futurecity10> shotgun
[1:34:16] <+thackattack00> you can get the shotgun it was chained
[1:34:17] <blightblues> you can get shotgun
[1:34:18] <xxshadowxx416> shotgun
[1:34:22] <ovan20> there's 2 more places with chains
[1:34:25] <TechDragon_Z> Shotgun, an locked store.
[1:34:27] <Charlie99993> Shotgun, two doors
[1:34:29] <asurite_warrior> shotty
[1:34:29] <LehranSF> There's a door with chains across from toy store
[1:34:40] <dukenux> then you should be able to discard these
[1:34:48] <TomFrank> store on right has chains
[1:35:23] <dukenux> hey now the game is already short as it is
[1:35:36] <Void_The_Dark> They move
[1:35:38] <C24U> They can open certain doors
[1:35:41] <theshillman> run RUINED
[1:35:56] <Triblade1992> Linear isn't the problem. REmake 2 was linear. the problem is that REmake 3 seems very copy pastted
[1:35:56] <Charlie99993> Also across from the doughnut store, opposite end of the road from the pharmacy
[1:35:57] <C24U> Zombies reset position if you leave their area
[1:35:58] <LehranSF> The AI is super abusable behind doorsin this game
[1:36:05] <GanktheGoat> Plague, delivering the good word of bullets
[1:36:23] <dukenux> turns out backtracking actually makes RE
[1:36:29] <Void_The_Dark> they only crowd around doors they can open
[1:36:31] <dukenux> *better
[1:36:37] <LehranSF> They straight-up walk back to their original spot if you leave a room.
[1:36:44] <Charlie99993> Right from the donuts is a chained door
[1:36:55] <ovan20> oh yeah, sorry, 3 places with chains :P
[1:37:02] <ovan20> that alley is one of them :P
[1:37:03] <arkv01> i-frame time
[1:37:40] <ovan20> you don't need to stagger them, you have the dodge now
[1:37:41] <C24U> There stagger was reduced from RE2R
[1:37:43] <Triblade1992> cut corners because REmake 2 had the stagger system
[1:37:54] <GanktheGoat> stab them while they are down
[1:37:55] <+ThatButler> RE3 Definitely feels like it had less time than 2 did
[1:37:55] <+nooseygoosey> this was the B-team game, right?
[1:38:02] <jiin6> B team's work
[1:38:02] <Triblade1992> It didn't in Remake 2
[1:38:02] <arkv01> it's pretty, but the combat is iffy
[1:38:06] <+scarletdye> For the town being completely overrun there’s like... a small convenience store size amount. Thought raccoon city had a huge population
[1:38:10] <+ThatButler> It feels like they cut 6 months of development
[1:38:12] <SilverRoddo> It’s almost like this game should reward players for aiming for the head
[1:38:14] <Triblade1992> second grenade
[1:38:17] <LehranSF> Hand grenade and handgun bullets
[1:38:19] <Explodincatz> shot ammo
[1:38:33] <LunarRemix> Would you say this could be an expansion rather than a standalone game?
[1:38:42] <Void_The_Dark> one more door and cabinet with shotgun
[1:38:51] <+scarletdye> It feels like a DLC for $20-$30 usd
[1:39:10] <Charlie99993> Well it does come with Resistance
[1:39:11] <sosuke5> That's one fancy box
[1:39:28] <Void_The_Dark> pointless box
[1:39:31] <Triblade1992> LOl
[1:39:50] <TomFrank> those are the crystal shards from kirby 64
[1:39:53] <+scarletdye> I wasn’t impressed with the multiplayer... then again every game I had was laggy.
[1:39:53] <C24U> Suspension of Disbelieve. Chug as much of it as you can
[1:39:57] <Void_The_Dark> just store the gem.
[1:40:04] <SilverRoddo> Chug that swamp
[1:40:18] <ralphwiggum16> Hi Plague
[1:40:37] <DraxTD> Start Pre shooting survivors, Plague, just keep them from turning early
[1:40:50] <+scarletdye> Remember when grenades had its own sub weapon inventory?
[1:40:52] <ralphwiggum16> when i think of RE2/RE3, I like to imagine the one normal Umbrella executive who is just hearing about all of this bioweapon stuff.
[1:41:07] <+KosParasite> Omg facecam
[1:41:18] <C24U> Jill's hat?
[1:41:22] <Void_The_Dark> aiming closer to the ground lets you roll grenades
[1:41:40] <Triblade1992> the toy store is going to make you groan
[1:41:44] <Void_The_Dark> You'll learn about the sparking thing later
[1:41:50] <chambatron> Do you like this game so far @PlagueOfGripes
[1:42:09] <Triblade1992> Told ya
[1:42:29] <DraxTD> technicly the lock made him grown
[1:42:47] <GanktheGoat> The railway control office is where the shotgun is
[1:43:02] <Void_The_Dark> Railway office
[1:43:09] <Void_The_Dark> has shotgun cabinet
[1:43:13] <+KosParasite> Have you played other res?
[1:43:29] <chambatron> Are you looking forward to FF7R?
[1:43:30] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes everytime
[1:44:00] <GanktheGoat> the shot gun has the kick back you are wishing for
[1:44:08] <Triblade1992> Well FF7R is a REMAKE, not a remaster
[1:44:12] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes are you excited for things?
[1:44:48] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, why do you think Dr. Li didn't save Raccoon City?
[1:45:28] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> there's no side quest in them notes
[1:45:37] <+Splatterfest> hey its your face
[1:46:00] <+thackattack00> I wonder if people would write survivor diaries irl during a crisis
[1:46:02] <+KosParasite> I miss the itchy tasty days
[1:46:02] <Void_The_Dark> you got it
[1:46:11] <SuperVaderMan> I'd imagine from a writing perspective, a fictional suicide note should have some emotional impact
[1:46:19] <ralphwiggum16> I miss when there were goblins in this game.
[1:46:24] <TomFrank> hey dont shoot the fuse boxes thanks :)
[1:46:47] <GanktheGoat> stab the dogs
[1:46:47] <Void_The_Dark> Wowee
[1:46:54] <blightblues> pupper killed mission failed
[1:46:59] <+swaggopotamus> woof woof
[1:47:00] <ralphwiggum16> Miyazaki hate dogs
[1:47:06] <Huntercd> There are only four dogs this game
[1:47:07] <coldarmracer> WTF is high voltage current?
[1:47:15] <+KosParasite> Dogs in games DansGame
[1:47:15] <Void_The_Dark> Think they are all reused
[1:47:41] <Amarky> The dogs use to scare the crap out of me when I was younger. Worst part of any RE game for me.
[1:47:42] <TomFrank> this part is pretty intense coming up
[1:47:48] <Huntercd> Jill must be dehydrated
[1:47:51] <Void_The_Dark> just explodes from a tap
[1:47:53] <Void_The_Dark> LUL
[1:48:06] <coldarmracer> its a complaint
[1:48:06] <ralphwiggum16> everything was scarier back in the '90s
[1:48:15] <ralphwiggum16> sounds like a gripe.
[1:48:34] <Huntercd> It Rev 1 jill pees on herself
[1:48:40] <Void_The_Dark> did it just skip back foe anyone?
[1:49:29] <+KosParasite> did you play re2r?
[1:49:51] <+Splatterfest> rock for me plague
[1:49:59] <s1rcuit> I think it's for the subway
[1:50:07] <ralphwiggum16> plague. sing for us
[1:50:13] <paladincustodio> RE3R is pretty bad
[1:50:22] <ovan20> no, the 4 breakers are ahead.
[1:50:38] <Huntercd> It isn't a bad game
[1:50:39] <+KosParasite> theres a secret in this room
[1:51:52] <blightblues> strangely enough that was there before the outbreak
[1:52:26] <ralphwiggum16> omg...
[1:52:33] <ralphwiggum16> nice dog ref
[1:52:58] <+KosParasite> outbreak scaled exponentially after the lab leak but it started a few days earlier actually
[1:53:00] <GarbageNirvana> Sounds like they just jumped back out
[1:53:06] <+scarletdye> Grandma works for Umbrella
[1:53:10] <+KosParasite> at least thats whats implied
[1:53:13] <GarbageNirvana> They got a whiff of that green and were like "nah fuck this"
[1:53:16] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes face hugger, but green herb killed them I guess
[1:53:34] <+nooseygoosey> herby fully loaded
[1:53:38] <+KosParasite> look at the top of the shelf there @plagueofgripes
[1:54:01] <ralphwiggum16> Where's Plague from again?
[1:54:12] <Huntercd> That company is super cheap
[1:54:16] <ralphwiggum16> Tennessee?
[1:54:17] <BrachyZoid> 18 raiders from BrachyZoid have joined! 
[1:54:25] <cap_bon> lockpicks are not something you can just pick up and use
[1:54:37] <blightblues> A lockpick is just a piece of metal
[1:54:56] <%Rezca> are all these employees former locksmiths?
[1:55:01] <s1rcuit> situations like that they'd just cut the lock
[1:55:10] <BrachyZoid> brachy1Brabuns lunarHi
[1:55:11] <ralphwiggum16> Dude, she's the master of unlocking
[1:55:15] <ralphwiggum16> She needs her lockpick
[1:55:19] <+Splatterfest> need a key for a lockpick case so you can pick a lock
[1:55:33] <+Splatterfest> yo we heard you like complex key puzzles
[1:55:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:56:07] <+Splatterfest> collectors
[1:56:11] <ralphwiggum16> Master of unlocking unlocked!
[1:56:13] <rubbishbinge> Poorly maintained lockpick
[1:56:13] <s1rcuit> the case is nicer than the lockpick
[1:56:20] <Amarky> That’s a fancy AF case
[1:56:21] <s1rcuit> the high voltage door @PlagueOfGripes
[1:56:25] <cap_bon> so everyone on staff knows how to use that thing to open padlocks onsite
[1:56:35] <+rei0> press the item, and then change it there
[1:56:37] <AJusticeLemon> go on the pistol in the inv
[1:56:37] <Void_The_Dark> click the gun in the inventory box
[1:56:38] <Djinnazz> you cahnage it on the item box
[1:56:48] <s1rcuit> @cap_bon traditional japanese padlocks
[1:56:55] <+KosParasite> just hold it and you can change it
[1:57:02] <Longerbone_ghm> @PlagueOfGripes Click the item in your inventory hit the shortcut option
[1:57:10] <+nooseygoosey> celrS
[1:57:13] <GanktheGoat> This scene was brought to you by fan-art! For fan-art!
[1:57:33] <coldarmracer> Is picarto some type of art based streaming site?
[1:57:40] <s1rcuit> something like that
[1:57:41] <+Splatterfest> plague quick draw a sexy rendition of that scene
[1:57:42] <Huntercd> She needs Plan B
[1:57:43] <arkv01> Squid1
[1:57:50] <gonzalogp98> eat a herb
[1:58:08] <Longerbone_ghm> Nah just your inventory

[1:58:40] <+zajoestar> this next part fuckin sucks
[1:58:43] <arkv01> insect penis, grossss!
[1:58:43] <+Splatterfest> there it is
[1:58:46] <Charlie99993> To be fair there was an entire note that implied something like this might happen
[1:58:52] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes didn't you find a note warning specifically about that thing?
[1:58:54] <arkv01> but then jill started loving the insect penis...
[1:59:07] <peachteagaming> how is the audio work on this game?
[1:59:09] <+Draylle> zap
[1:59:14] <blightblues> bug zapper

[1:59:32] <+KosParasite> this part is so annoying
[1:59:35] <rubbishbinge> This must be that zapping system I've heard of
[1:59:38] <GanktheGoat> aren't these guys infected fleas?
[1:59:46] <peachteagaming> are you easily scared by bugs?
[2:00:04] <cap_bon> how lnog was this growing down here

[2:00:36] <peachteagaming> some of it is
[2:00:51] <+TheyTookMyBeard> are these the throat fucker enemies?
[2:01:04] <TimetodiveLTX> throat fuckers are not your enemies
[2:01:04] <+KosParasite> yup
[2:01:26] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Eck it looks like a giant louse

[2:03:37] <Charlie99993> You walked past it before
[2:03:39] <GanktheGoat> back near the ladder
[2:03:47] <Void_The_Dark> 4th one is the first one you missed by the ladder you went up
[2:03:55] <CyberDingus> They will spawn endlessly. Your bullets are finite. Cease this tomfoolery.
[2:04:23] <+KosParasite> funny how the company did nothing about this
[2:04:24] <@Nightbot> @darkgareth01 -> Who the heck are you? My evil twin? [stop spamming emotes] [warning]

[2:05:16] <+scarletdye> So how fast do you think they made this hive,
[2:05:41] <+KosParasite> not instantly but definetly it was noticeable

[2:17:23] <SenTheScaleless> Imagine surviving a punch from Nemesis
[2:17:29] <Charlie99993> You've got an assault rifle now
[2:17:34] <+KosParasite> damm never saw the stomp before
[2:17:49] <LunarRemix> It's like sub 1 second from him showing up to him attacking you
[2:17:54] <+Splatterfest> lmao
[2:17:54] <+scarletdye> Nemesis is an anime villain
[2:17:55] <jiin6> HAHAHA
[2:17:58] <Djinnazz> He jumped in.
[2:17:58] <terminusterminal> He just noclips in there like he's doom
[2:18:05] <+rytyoung> WEIRD
[2:18:05] <VERDAXY> no destruction or anything
[2:18:07] <blightblues> spider nemesis spider nemesis
[2:18:07] <+Crimznking> no clip to area
[2:18:12] <Explodincatz> spiderman webswing
[2:18:40] <terminusterminal> He hits that pole at his mass so fast and it just tanks him and doesn't budge
[2:18:42] <+Crimznking> rubberband to player position X
[2:18:42] <SilverRoddo> The background assets didn’t even move.
[2:18:52] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> thats how programmingworks, yes
[2:18:54] <SenTheScaleless> He's using the mhw slinger
[2:19:05] <Charlie99993> Has he noticed the assault rifle
[2:19:06] <+scarletdye> So if he’s so fast and can basically naruto jump from out of nowhere... why’s he still so slow when he’s on screen
[2:19:07] <jiin6> oh capcom...two steps forward, tumble off the mountain into the ocean
[2:19:07] <+KosParasite> this game should have come out next year
[2:19:08] <GanktheGoat> shotgun is in that building
[2:19:10] <xxshadowxx416> go get shotgun
[2:19:13] <jiin6> they look fresh
[2:19:21] <VERDAXY> wtf?
[2:19:22] <Charlie99993> It's from easy mode
[2:19:23] <blightblues> for easy mode
[2:19:23] <Mister_McDerp> from the assist mode
[2:19:24] <Dragon_RW> Assisted mode
[2:19:26] <Djinnazz> When you clicked Easy mode
[2:19:27] <+KosParasite> assisted mode
[2:19:33] <koffeemancer> You get it for free in assisted mode
[2:19:34] <conchubar11> where did you come from plague?
[2:19:37] <Futurecity10> Pick up the shotgun
[2:19:38] <+dontgiveupskeleton> assisted mode
[2:19:45] <Charlie99993> You clicked yes for easy mode

[2:20:37] <Guardiansaiyan> @PlagueOfGripes Just mash it!
[2:20:47] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes you might want to screenshot that for later
[2:21:17] <+dontgiveupskeleton> FA -> FA -> SA
[2:21:21] <+KosParasite> its on the wall in front of you
[2:21:30] <+dontgiveupskeleton> FA -> RA -> SA
[2:21:31] <Charlie99993> Pull back, it's on a big chart on the wall
[2:21:31] <TechDragon_Z> If you back out you can look at the wall
[2:21:35] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes make sure to do the smaller panels to the right
[2:21:51] <peachteagaming> BIG BRAIN
[2:22:13] <SilverRoddo> bitterBrain
[2:22:18] <+dontgiveupskeleton> look at the circled items on the map
[2:22:22] <+Splatterfest> just play dark souls again
[2:22:22] <frunkAF> that's the possible
[2:22:26] <frunkAF> puzzle*
[2:22:28] <arkv01> this is hilarious, my city's subway only has one line and it loops
[2:22:42] <Dragon_RW> Fox park
[2:22:43] <Charlie99993> Pull out of this screen, look at the wall
[2:22:44] <blightblues> fox park
[2:22:51] <TechDragon_Z> There's a chart on the wall if you back out of this screen
[2:23:01] <arkv01> bad boomer instruction manuals
[2:23:01] <Dragon_RW> It's easy
[2:23:11] <GanktheGoat> there is a map on the wall, the one in front of you is a red herring
[2:23:14] <frunkAF> if you fail it once it will show you the answer on the next screen
[2:23:18] <+Risingxiv> Plague just back out and look at the wall in front of you
[2:23:22] <+rytyoung> Confirm it and you'll receive more info
[2:23:23] <Dragon_RW> Want me to tell you the correct order?
[2:23:37] <+dontgiveupskeleton> plague the answer is on the map, just look at the markings
[2:23:39] <Dragon_RW> Use numbers on the right
[2:23:44] <arkv01> big mash
[2:23:45] <Dragon_RW> Press right
[2:23:45] <xxshadowxx416> fa 02
[2:23:47] <Brunothebodyguard> RA->RA->rasputin
[2:23:49] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> the Paige way of solving puzzles
[2:23:50] <Ki_Memento> first 2 letters of each block in order
[2:23:55] <+Draylle> brute smarts
[2:23:55] <arkv01> mashing may not be the smartest way but it gives me the most satisfaction
[2:24:01] <frunkAF> wow. such great puzzle Kappa
[2:24:02] <+rytyoung> @brunothebodyguard what a guy
[2:24:20] <s1rcuit> fa 02 Ra 03 Sa 02 and F0 02 I think @PlagueOfGripes
[2:24:24] <xxshadowxx416> ra 03
[2:24:37] <+dontgiveupskeleton> that's FA not RA
[2:25:06] <peachteagaming> Plague daddy is smart!
[2:25:11] <Charlie99993> Merely pretending to be retarded
[2:25:24] <Guardiansaiyan> RA 03
[2:25:32] <+dontgiveupskeleton> change the second FA to RA
[2:25:34] <Guardiansaiyan> T_T
[2:25:36] <blightblues> fix third option
[2:25:51] <Charlie99993> He did it again
[2:25:58] <SenTheScaleless> Amazing
[2:25:59] <rubbishbinge> lul
[2:25:59] <Sneaky_Canuck> look at me
[2:26:03] <xeros720> montreal has a lot of trains plague
[2:26:06] <Brunothebodyguard> BINGO
[2:26:09] <Mister_McDerp> NotLikeThis
[2:26:13] <Explodincatz> im losing it
[2:26:13] <Charlie99993> BRAIN INJURED
[2:26:18] <+rytyoung> LUL
[2:26:28] <+Risingxiv> big brain puzzels LUL
[2:26:33] <peachteagaming> BIG BRAIN!
[2:26:43] <blightblues> less of a puzzle and more trying to read poor instructions
[2:26:49] <frunkAF> BIG BRAIN
[2:27:02] <Brunothebodyguard> COUNTRY BRAIN
[2:27:03] <+Splatterfest> brain in critical condition
[2:27:05] <+dontgiveupskeleton> plague it was the first two letters of each station
[2:27:15] <+Draylle> its more of a connect the dots than it is a puzzle
[2:27:15] <peachteagaming> BIG BRAIN
[2:27:21] <frunkAF> don't worry. this is the last really bad "puzzle"
[2:27:23] <GanktheGoat> go back for the shot gun!
[2:27:32] <Charlie99993> RIP shotgun
[2:27:38] <+dontgiveupskeleton> SHOTGUN
[2:27:40] <frunkAF> F Shotgun BibleThump
[2:27:44] <xeros720> F shotty
[2:27:50] <peachteagaming> head exploding is normal
[2:27:51] <Sneaky_Canuck> wait whys he have an AR
[2:28:03] <Brunothebodyguard> the snicker cut off enough oxygen to plagues brain to make his weaker
[2:28:10] <+Splatterfest> ^
[2:28:14] <+rytyoung> oh noooo
[2:28:22] <+rytyoung> LUL
[2:28:35] <+rytyoung> I've never seen him duck into here before
[2:28:35] <Korndogg10> kow kind of him to duck down the door
[2:28:43] <%Samex_Comex> Honey I'm home!
[2:28:58] <+Splatterfest> hes actually straight from marvel vs capcom
[2:29:05] <Charlie99993> You don't really NEED a shotgun in an RE game
[2:29:07] <+Draylle> rawr
[2:29:11] <+dontgiveupskeleton> MONSTER HUNTER SCREAM
[2:29:12] <terminusterminal> Nemesis seems like he's barely a speedbump
[2:29:12] <+thackattack00> monster hunter roar
[2:29:13] <xeros720> with how much he wrecks the environment in the first hours, you wouldn't expect him to respect doors
[2:29:18] <Korndogg10> fus ro dah
[2:29:19] <mslizard> Bad breath nemesis
[2:29:19] <HyperBomb21> Jill needs HG Earplugs
[2:29:26] <+Splatterfest> @Charlie99993 you only need it
[2:29:37] <+rytyoung> waiting for my Nemesis monster hunter world fight
[2:29:54] <Charlie99993> I can't let this game drag me like this
[2:29:55] <GanktheGoat> look out the window
[2:30:18] <SenTheScaleless> Nemesis waiting patiently for Jill to finish reading
[2:30:23] <GanktheGoat> he just waits outside
[2:30:24] <xeros720> the alternate world where bad box art megaman is loved
[2:30:28] <NickHatesSnow> Cool Ghost and Goblins poster
[2:30:35] <Charlie99993> He will get the mod for the shotgun though, that's good
[2:30:40] <Explodincatz> fancy clicking
[2:30:44] <xeros720> lol
[2:30:45] <+dontgiveupskeleton> YES THERE IS A MAP
[2:30:46] <conchubar11> I M M E R S I O N
[2:30:47] <LunarRemix> Oh hey it's Megaman
[2:30:48] <Huntercd> ha
[2:30:50] <+rytyoung> touch pad
[2:30:55] <+rytyoung> oh wait keyboard
[2:30:56] <marlowe86> Hi Plague!
[2:30:57] <NickHatesSnow> I never saw this map lol
[2:31:02] <Charlie99993> He's using KB+M
[2:31:18] <BeNiceImShy> Is Nemesis just...chilling outside? "Hey man, gotta let 'im read his comics."
[2:31:23] <xeros720> did plague get the "tall glass of water" line from carlos?
[2:31:32] <+nooseygoosey> red means items still in area
[2:31:35] <frunkAF> Plague, did you play RE2 Remake?
[2:31:50] <Sneaky_Canuck> F
[2:31:56] <conchubar11> ganked
[2:32:07] <Charlie99993> Man, the gammas are going to annihilate him
[2:32:18] <xxshadowxx416> go get shotgun
[2:32:38] <+dontgiveupskeleton> Space bar to Skip
[2:32:42] <LunarRemix> His attack animation looks weridly slowed down.
[2:32:49] <GanktheGoat> also if you find all three jewels you get more inventory slots
[2:32:49] <LunarRemix> Weirdly*
[2:32:49] <NickHatesSnow> People seem too like this game a lot when they have a rocket launcher
[2:32:56] <mslizard> Nemesis is cheap
[2:33:05] <Charlie99993> @xxshadowxx416 The shotgun is a figment of your imagination, plauge's a confident young woman who don't need no shotgun
[2:33:10] <LunarRemix> Like some test players complained and they just slowed the attack animation by like 8%
[2:33:14] <+dontgiveupskeleton> there is in fact another one
[2:33:39] <+Risingxiv> damn teleporting
[2:33:43] <Charlie99993> He's slower because the difficulty is on easy
[2:33:54] <+Risingxiv> LUL landed on a zombie
[2:34:08] <+rytyoung> the dodge timing is weird, Pat seemed to be insanely good at pulling it off
[2:34:10] <+dontgiveupskeleton> USE THE CLOCK
[2:34:13] <xeros720> my experience in the demo gave me the impression that attacks need to by dodged in the correct direction
[2:34:24] <+Draylle> a grenade of course
[2:34:26] <xeros720> nem's attacks tend to be more generous, oddly enough
[2:34:36] <+nooseygoosey> oh goodie
[2:34:38] <+dontgiveupskeleton> NO SHOTGUN
[2:34:45] <GanktheGoat> it was back at the railstations
[2:34:54] <Charlie99993> He can't go back for it now
[2:35:00] <Charlie99993> No way out of the rail station
[2:35:08] <+nooseygoosey> walked right by it
[2:35:10] <GanktheGoat> yeah
[2:35:47] <xeros720> is this now shotgunless run?
[2:35:48] <Charlie99993> Bolt cutter is now trash, I wonder if he'll ever take it out of the inventory
[2:36:06] <+Splatterfest> thats kinda funny no shotgun
[2:36:20] <Charlie99993> It would, but you never cut the chain on the shotgun
[2:36:30] <TomFrank> that shotgun does a lot of damage, you might want to go back and get it
[2:36:33] <Sneaky_Canuck> you missed some uses for it
[2:36:41] <+swaggopotamus> this is the first run im seeing someone miss the shotgun.
[2:36:43] <LunarRemix> God those alpha strong men are so sexy. God I wish I was like them.
[2:36:45] <conchubar11> is he German, is he Russian? Ambiguous European Accent Man
[2:37:03] <NickHatesSnow> he's ruusian
[2:37:04] <Charlie99993> @TomFrank He can't unless he restarts the game because he already saved over his old save
[2:37:19] <TomFrank> @Charlie99993 yea
[2:37:36] <+Splatterfest> Pat never got around to teaching Plague how to rotate saves
[2:37:41] <Dragon_RW> Get the item
[2:37:44] <+dontgiveupskeleton> THE BOX
[2:37:52] <Dragon_RW> He dropped a box
[2:37:57] <Sneaky_Canuck> lmao
[2:38:20] <+swaggopotamus> this one's special
[2:38:24] <+dontgiveupskeleton> it was an upgrade to the handgun
[2:38:24] <+swaggopotamus> I gotta say
[2:38:37] <+swaggopotamus> perfect storm so far
[2:38:50] <blightblues> the best stage of any RE game
[2:39:01] <+Splatterfest> hahahahaha
[2:39:02] <Charlie99993> You can combine there 100%
[2:39:04] <Dragon_RW> Point over the green to combine
[2:39:07] <+Splatterfest> love this shit
[2:40:55] <+Splatterfest> what? I was sure you were enthralled by it
[2:41:15] <+dontgiveupskeleton> time for bitch arms
[2:41:27] <Charlie99993> Plauge's gonna get vored now
[2:41:31] <%Samex_Comex> Fish people! :O
[2:41:33] <Charlie99993> Called it
[2:41:46] <+nooseygoosey> nice touch on the backwards spine break fold
[2:41:48] <LunarRemix> Someone's going to have some fun with those models.
[2:41:58] <SenTheScaleless> Konosuba reference
[2:42:00] <+dontgiveupskeleton> what would a reverse hunter gamma look like
[2:42:06] <+dontgiveupskeleton> extremely long arms and bitch legs
[2:42:08] <+ThatButler> People should NOT bend that way!
[2:42:11] <Charlie99993> Someone's already had their fun with all this ryona
[2:42:17] <EscourtMission> Did you not get the grenade launcher yet? It makes this area much easier
[2:42:35] <TheWallowingWeeb> The fucking balls on you
[2:42:38] <BrachyZoid> well so much for that wall
[2:42:38] <+nooseygoosey> this is a special kind of playthrough
[2:42:39] <EscourtMission> They're in the original game too
[2:42:46] <xxshadowxx416> did he walk past it
[2:43:10] <Charlie99993> He did, but he won't be able to walk back around it probably
[2:43:21] <+dontgiveupskeleton> but he has the grenade launcher now
[2:43:48] <Charlie99993> Don't they talk about why that is on page 1 of this note
[2:43:53] <BrachyZoid> For science
[2:43:59] <blightblues> it'll probably work itself out
[2:44:12] <Brunothebodyguard> Umbrella King
[2:44:21] <+nooseygoosey> an umbrella is wildly successful without the whole monster thing
[2:44:23] <LunarRemix> Maybe they think it's cute.
[2:44:25] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Maybe Umbrella got bought out by another company who wanted to cut costs, and then the monsters came?
[2:44:33] <Brunothebodyguard> Joe Nemesis
[2:44:58] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Like, they used to be really good, hence the amazing science, but then the new guy is like "we can't keep paying for these safety precautions."
[2:45:12] <Charlie99993> @cereal_box_conspiracy Umbrella cut this project, so these scientists hid them on the sewers to try and sell it elsewhere
[2:45:27] <terminusterminal> I wish there was somebody in the background just calling all of this out like Chris laughing at Wesker's dumb giant.
[2:45:49] <+nooseygoosey> this is the series where people do not have the forethought about what theyll do after becoming a horrible monstrosity
[2:46:54] <+dontgiveupskeleton> shoot when it opens its mouth
[2:47:37] <Djinnazz> Yeah, kinda
[2:47:55] <+Splatterfest> oh the waste
[2:48:02] <+dontgiveupskeleton> STOP it was already deaaaaad
[2:48:03] <Charlie99993> Plauge throwing grenades at already dead enemies
[2:48:06] <Brunothebodyguard> it's all nemesis using the toilet
[2:48:20] <SuperVaderMan> king doody
[2:48:22] <kingofnymphs> King Dodongo?
[2:48:26] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes Dodongo
[2:48:45] <blightblues> that thing takes up twice as much space as a fire hose
[2:49:07] <GarbageNirvana> RE4 doesn't really need remade
[2:49:14] <GarbageNirvana> Polished up a bit, maybe
[2:49:17] <Brunothebodyguard> ha
[2:49:23] <Dragon_RW> Reload
[2:49:24] <+Splatterfest> the hair is bad in this game
[2:49:54] <Dragon_RW> Combine
[2:50:05] <Dragon_RW> Combine on pick up
[2:50:11] <Deitylight> Hello
[2:51:04] <Dragon_RW> You can combine on pick up
[2:51:19] <Dragon_RW> There is loot
[2:51:21] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes those umbrela scientists are monsterfuckers. Explains a lot.
[2:51:28] <Dragon_RW> Red ^
[2:51:55] <NickHatesSnow> good dodge
[2:52:01] <Charlie99993> You click the thing you want to combine with
[2:52:04] <Dragon_RW> Just put mouse over the other gun powder
[2:52:04] <CyberDingus> also - stop abusing the Iframes
[2:52:10] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> oh jesus that was close
[2:52:23] <EuropanLamprey> Alright I'm back, did Plague snuff the puppers yet?
[2:53:05] <SilverRoddo> If Jill were an animal, what would see be?
[2:53:06] <Dragon_RW> Get the battery
[2:53:10] <CyberDingus> wait, why Plague has that m16 thingy?
[2:53:36] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> game went on easy mode on him after too many deaths
[2:53:56] <Charlie99993> He clicked yes for easy mode because he wasn't paying attention
[2:54:03] <Melchior_the_Wise> Does Jill have her classic costume?
[2:54:04] <CyberDingus> Oh.
[2:54:19] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> no her original outfit no.
[2:54:53] <Brunothebodyguard> is this the game they got pissy about the skirt/shorts thing
[2:54:57] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> her og out was a skirt, the pre order gives a look alike but shes just swearing shorts that look like a skirt.
[2:55:12] <Chatterbox1991> Blonde Jill best jill
[2:55:22] <+Splatterfest> ^
[2:55:32] <%Samex_Comex> Ewww
[2:55:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:55:34] <Charlie99993> Weak taste
[2:55:41] <critfumble_> ugh terrible taste
[2:55:44] <Charlie99993> Wetsuit Rev 1 Jill
[2:55:51] <LunarRemix> She moves too fast for her animation while holding it
[2:55:55] <Heartless_01> cute squeak
[2:56:07] <SuperVaderMan> wonder where he found that flamethrower
[2:56:08] <Deitylight> STARS
[2:56:20] <Chatterbox1991> I conceed the Eddie Murhpey-Esque purple tract suit is a bit much
[2:56:29] <Korndogg10> why'd he let you go though LUL
[2:56:33] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> anime logic, could crush her head like an egg. no just toss her
[2:56:37] <+Splatterfest> blonde jill will come back when wesker comes back and she will have an even bigger butt you'll all see
[2:56:47] <Tersalus> but...that flamethrower just slows him down, hes stronger just suplexing you into dust
[2:56:53] <+nooseygoosey> nemmy has manners
[2:57:01] <SilverRoddo> RPGEmpty
[2:57:08] <Brunothebodyguard> nemesimps
[2:57:10] <Korndogg10> nemesis is surprisingly kind
[2:57:22] <Tersalus> a sporting laddie
[2:57:27] <Heartless_01> gentle giant
[2:57:39] <Charlie99993> Isn't A+A acid?
[2:57:52] <Melchior_the_Wise> plague, you look like somebody famous
[2:57:54] <Tersalus> is nemesis enjoying himself during this? I like to think that hes just here for a good time :)
[2:57:58] <Melchior_the_Wise> but I can't place it
[2:58:11] <SenTheScaleless> STOOORS
[2:58:13] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> this game is definitely rushed
[2:58:25] <$vampireinarm> its my favorite bald man
[2:58:31] <LunarRemix> what
[2:58:33] <LunarRemix> What was that for?
[2:59:10] <+Splatterfest> everythings on fire but this nice path for jill
[2:59:21] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> like the whole building is covered in gasoline
[2:59:39] <Heartless_01> i laughed when i saw this save room
[2:59:42] <Brunothebodyguard> it's made of 1930's barn wood
[2:59:50] <Booveman> I’d like to know how metal catches on fire from a flamethrower
[2:59:55] <Tersalus> spoiler, but in the end credits you can see that nemesis became a professional potter after this, and has ceramics displayed in the Louvre
[2:59:56] <mirainousagi> good old game room, nemesis cant enter here cause reasons
[3:00:03] <Charlie99993> @Booveman Napalm
[3:00:03] <$vampireinarm> Nemesis in this game is a great example of an incompetent threat
[3:00:04] <Brunothebodyguard> @booveman 9/11
[3:00:57] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> like visually, yes this nemesis is cool. but so pathetic in this game.
[3:01:03] <NickHatesSnow> it is
[3:01:04] <ahaegotrigger> it can be for sure
[3:01:08] <Heartless_01> women need alone time in save rooms
[3:01:13] <+nooseygoosey> wait until you see the "replay" value
[3:01:28] <Korndogg10> is that how fire works ?
[3:01:42] <Deitylight> Nemesis doesn't give you personal space in higher difficulty. He's also super fast
[3:01:47] <Brunothebodyguard> jill has to buy more wood from mernards after this
[3:01:54] <NickHatesSnow> he looks cool at least
[3:01:59] <Tersalus> i spiwwed aww of my fiwah :(
[3:02:34] <SuperVaderMan> nyoom
[3:02:34] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> from what we see from the redos plague does. he's not fast just glitch warping. that's just cheap
[3:02:53] <SuperVaderMan> he scootin
[3:02:54] <marlowe86> yeah the top 2 difficuly levels are pretty frustrating
[3:03:15] <Tersalus> oh
[3:03:15] <+rytyoung> He's got some Wesker esque dodges when it comes to shooting him with a grenade launcher
[3:03:22] <%Samex_Comex> He just wants stars :(
[3:03:39] <Tersalus> well that's the end of HIM! R)
[3:03:39] <Melchior_the_Wise> She got strong grip
[3:03:40] <Booveman> I thought this Nemesis was supposed to be more threatening but he seems pretty chill
[3:03:45] <critfumble_> what's even exploding this while thing is polythene sheets and rebar
[3:03:51] <+nooseygoosey> i applaud nemmy's interest in astronomy
[3:03:52] <critfumble_> whole*
[3:03:57] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:04:02] <%Samex_Comex> Gold star stickers
[3:04:06] <MKUltima> He's mad at the light pollution of Raccoon City
[3:04:07] <Melchior_the_Wise> What if it's like he's king kong and he just loves Jill?
[3:04:11] <$vampireinarm> nemesis here only shows up in scripted bits, hes a WAY less threatening Mr.X
[3:04:12] <+Splatterfest> no mars plague
[3:04:17] <Tersalus> "there are billions and billions of STAAAARRSSS"
[3:04:20] <BeNiceImShy> Just a massive fan of astronomy
[3:04:21] <terminusterminal> He has a bit of autism that harms his communication skills, but his passion is genuine.
[3:04:21] <+Splatterfest> you cant leave this planet
[3:04:25] <Booveman> Get ur ass to mars!
[3:04:26] <BrachyZoid> Get your ass to MAAAARS
[3:04:29] <Heartless_01> he's a pokemon that wants to study astronomy
[3:04:31] <Booveman> Lol
[3:04:36] <Booveman> Jinx
[3:04:39] <seth45er> so nemesis is Elon musk just less of a monster?
[3:04:43] <Ynkubus18> Go. Live. Mars.
[3:04:44] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes maybe he's trying to request S.T.A.R.S. assistance
[3:04:44] <LunarRemix> Does he dream about re-re-making cosmos?
[3:04:46] <NickHatesSnow> normal sized cars
[3:04:53] <critfumble_> tasteful heavy wood paneling
[3:04:58] <Chatterbox1991> gotta love 70s style paneling
[3:05:05] <critfumble_> "tasteful"
[3:05:08] <LunarRemix> Oh wait this is the 90's
[3:05:10] <%Rezca> about the last time I saw that a family vehicle was just a Van
[3:05:13] <LunarRemix> So just remake cosmos
[3:05:20] <Melchior_the_Wise> I'm glad most of the styles from the 70s went away
[3:05:30] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> oooh plague the police car at the rpd gate is fucking enormous to jill
[3:05:42] <critfumble_> if in doubt, Wesker did it
[3:05:46] <SilverRoddo> I wish they made cars out of wood, again.
[3:05:47] <CyberDingus> She likes chunky guys.
[3:05:51] <Heartless_01> lewd
[3:05:54] <NickHatesSnow> LUL
[3:05:56] <%Samex_Comex> This is getting hot
[3:06:00] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> compared to the other cars shes normal sized but the pokice car by the gate is huge
[3:06:02] <CyberDingus> Lewd!
[3:06:05] <Booveman> doodCap Linear thinking linear gameplay
[3:06:10] <Brunothebodyguard> zombilingus
[3:06:14] <LunarRemix> I mean this is Zombie Movie - The Video Game. Not really expecting deep character motivations here
[3:06:17] <Goergorion> lewd zombos
[3:06:21] <BrachyZoid> The acceptable one
[3:06:22] <Tersalus> eating ass transcends death itself
[3:06:28] <BrachyZoid> Zombie Jesus would've been disappointed
[3:06:37] <Brunothebodyguard> would they eat ass in time like this
[3:06:38] <critfumble_> STAAAAARbucks
[3:06:44] <peachteagaming> buy a girl starbucks
[3:07:01] <Booveman> What she can’t pick a simple lock?
[3:07:13] <SilverRoddo> Get two wrenches, and break the lock.
[3:07:15] <+rytyoung> yup
[3:07:24] <NickHatesSnow> master of unlocking my ass
[3:07:38] <peachteagaming> RE 3 happens before RE 2
[3:07:38] <Booveman> No wonder she’s just a sandwich
[3:07:41] <terminusterminal> How old is Jill in remake? She looks almost thirty-ish here but I thought she was 20 something
[3:07:55] <terminusterminal> Or not? I can't tell
[3:07:57] <Sunstalker> Was he gonna shout don't move to a zombie?
[3:07:57] <Goergorion> Hello Kendo, just looting your store.
[3:07:59] <%hgtarras> Is your body ready for ff7 remake. Or have somethings you heard about make you upset?
[3:08:13] <NickHatesSnow> You can just break it without picking
[3:08:17] <critfumble_> a rake will sort out most padlocks tbh
[3:08:22] <+EyeFarted> 2020 just keeps getting worse
[3:08:38] <+BioHunter> same guy
[3:08:40] <Booveman> I want Kendo’s original lines back from RE2
[3:08:43] <Goergorion> listen at the door
[3:08:46] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes ...he does
[3:08:47] <critfumble_> eat the plant
[3:08:47] <Brunothebodyguard> that's post apocalyps anthony fantano
[3:08:49] <xxshadowxx416> say for a second
[3:08:49] <codycurry52> To be fair to this game, assisted mode really doesn't show off the really fun stuff this game does. The story mode is good it's just lacking as a whole.
[3:09:16] <Dragon_RW> There is a locker to your left
[3:09:19] <Heartless_01> dont be silly
[3:09:27] <codycurry52> there's a box
[3:09:30] <Charlie99993> If only there was a locker less than 3 feet from you right now
[3:09:32] <Sunstalker> Load more grenades in?
[3:09:34] <Booveman> This remake is more a reimagining of RE3. Its cut out so much
[3:09:49] <Goergorion> Listen at the door
[3:09:57] <LunarRemix> Funny that it came around the time of FF7R
[3:10:07] <LunarRemix> People are going to have a big talk about remakes and changing stuff.
[3:10:09] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> yeah i heard you dont even fight the gravedigger in this game
[3:10:12] <Charlie99993> Easy mode
[3:10:36] <terminusterminal> How much of FF7 Remake will you be streaming Plague? Is it possible to request all of it, or is that too much?
[3:10:39] <Booveman> I never played FF7 so I can’t say anything about it but it looks pretty
[3:11:04] <Explodincatz> im done with remakes/remasters/re-whatever
[3:11:21] <Booveman> Cash grabs
[3:11:23] <Heartless_01> i miss auto-discard
[3:11:25] <%Samex_Comex> Dear diary, a giant zombie yelled stars and tried to burn me
[3:11:25] <codycurry52> You can throw it away
[3:11:33] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> if there was any game that needs a remake is xenogears
[3:11:36] <peachteagaming> they animated that whole damn thing
[3:11:37] <codycurry52> Trashcan Icon
[3:11:45] <+TheHomieChrisParks> plague you can click on it and discard when it has the trash icon on it
[3:11:48] <HyperBomb21> The Time Jannies!
[3:11:53] <EuropanLamprey> I just call em Time Fucks
[3:11:56] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa what!?
[3:11:57] <LunarRemix> You know they call them Changebad ghost on some parts on the net?
[3:12:02] <MKUltima> WOAH WOAH WOAH
[3:12:06] <MKUltima> Red XIII doesn't wear pants
[3:12:12] <+rytyoung> Funny you should say that...
[3:12:14] <Brunothebodyguard> ghost ghostface killa
[3:12:28] <ECRead> this went 0 to 100 real quick
[3:12:30] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> i don't get this ghost thing
[3:12:31] <BrachyZoid> What Ghost we talking about?
[3:12:37] <codycurry52> If a item has a trash can icon on it you can throw it away
[3:12:41] <HyperBomb21> FF7 remake
[3:12:43] <Sunstalker> I want Id Software to make a Hellboy game isntead of another Doom next. FeelsBadMan
[3:12:44] <EuropanLamprey> ! Dark Spirit Time Jannie has invaded !

[3:13:45] <Brunothebodyguard> @eyefarted swing log sweet jenovah
[3:13:47] <+forgetme000> I feel like theres gonna be an internet war over FF7 no matter what
[3:14:11] <Booveman> He should sing long talk sally
[3:14:12] <HyperBomb21> its inevitable. fanbys gonna rage as awlasy
[3:14:22] <Booveman> Tall*
[3:14:33] <%Samex_Comex> His head is a anus
[3:14:36] <LunarRemix> At least there will be high quality official models for the FF7 cast.
[3:14:40] <Tersalus> MWUAH!! ;p
[3:14:55] <EuropanLamprey> What Dark Souls thing?
[3:15:07] <HyperBomb21> atpRstd
[3:15:14] <Booveman> Hiding behind corners
[3:15:18] <HyperBomb21> atpRtsd4
[3:15:23] <Goergorion> Corner camping
[3:15:37] <ahaegotrigger> theyre like preedged
[3:15:39] <MKUltima> Creepers
[3:15:41] <Booveman> Surprise mothafucka
[3:15:44] <critfumble_> it's cheap but doing it too much is lazy imo
[3:15:45] <Sunstalker> Monster wallflowers?
[3:15:50] <terminusterminal> Placed explicitly to hit the player and not because it makes sense for them to be there?
[3:15:52] <Brunothebodyguard> monster credenza
[3:15:54] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:16:05] <Goergorion> Leg shots
[3:16:11] <HyperBomb21> more like monster port-a-potties
[3:16:13] <codycurry52> Shotgun
[3:16:22] <+Queenemereldas> shoot it in the body
[3:16:24] <+Eddy21forsaken> shoot the body
[3:16:26] <Sunstalker> Dodge?
[3:16:31] <HyperBomb21> Just kill it
[3:16:38] <+dontgiveupskeleton> maybe if you had the shotty
[3:16:47] <BrachyZoid> Gotta love playing games one hates
[3:16:48] <mizamar> papa Plague livecam?! PogChamp
[3:16:51] <Goergorion> knee cap
[3:17:00] <+forgetme000> good thing theres so little of it lol
[3:17:06] <@Nightbot> @SilverRoddo -> I'm not scared. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[3:17:33] <SilverRoddo> I forgot the 4 ‘mote night bot
[3:18:04] <+Eddy21forsaken> don't worry plague if you decide to try the harder difficulty, you'll despise the game even more
[3:18:08] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh he found a new toy
[3:18:20] <Goergorion> that was his Flamer, he threw it
[3:18:24] <+forgetme000> that was the flame thrower
[3:18:37] <SilverRoddo> Rocket guitar case?
[3:18:48] <+Eddy21forsaken> just hold up
[3:19:07] <critfumble_> that box opening animation was pretty funny
[3:19:14] <+Eddy21forsaken> these nemesis sections are just hold up
[3:19:55] <@Nightbot> @ThatButler -> Sometimes I even amaze myself. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[3:19:57] <NickHatesSnow> yep
[3:20:02] <%Samex_Comex> It was cool once
[3:20:06] <SuperVaderMan> it's like "ooh, look at this cool rocket model for a second"
[3:20:09] <%MajorDub> gives you enough time to see all the imperfections in the shot
[3:20:10] <Yummy_Nukes> are you saying the matrix is lame and stupid?
[3:20:10] <critfumble_> love to just have an infinite ammo rocket launcher, how's he loading it that fast
[3:20:11] <mizamar> SlowChamp no way
[3:20:40] <xstormyone> its usually hard to tell that it is slow motion when its done well
[3:20:41] <NickHatesSnow> slow motion works in comedy I guess
[3:20:44] <alextrebeken> if it involves some kind of kata its cool but RE aint that kinda game
[3:20:48] <SilverRoddo> I love the slowed-down sound effects as well.
[3:20:49] <EuropanLamprey> It's only supposed to be used to let the audience catch details too fast to see normally, not to make an action scene look cooler
[3:20:50] <HyperBomb21> slow motion needs to be used sparingly
[3:20:53] <critfumble_> this game has big shut up it's cool energy
[3:20:55] <+ThatButler> Nah this game did a very poor job with pacing and suspence
[3:20:57] <+forgetme000> depends on how its done
[3:21:03] <BrachyZoid> Lack of suspension of disbelief
[3:21:13] <LunarRemix> Because Nemesis is so fast I feel like I would feel anxiety if anything. When he shows up there's not much time to think about what to do.
[3:21:13] <HyperBomb21> pfft
[3:21:17] <HyperBomb21> thats too silly
[3:21:19] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:21:20] <Yummy_Nukes> RUN INDIE
[3:21:23] <SuperVaderMan> that looks so bad LUL
[3:21:25] <GarbageNirvana> Don't lose your HEAD, Eli
[3:21:27] <+Eddy21forsaken> LUL
[3:21:32] <shevan123> what the fuck was that about
[3:21:35] <Explodincatz> east mode slowed it down
[3:21:45] <Sunstalker> The boulder rolling down in Dragons Dogma looked better LUL
[3:21:46] <ahaegotrigger> LUL god slow motion DOES looks SO cool
[3:21:47] <Explodincatz> its WAY faster on harder modes
[3:21:49] <Yummy_Nukes> i blame the happenings
[3:21:53] <critfumble_> that does kinda blow, if only resident evil protagonists ever broke into more than a light jog
[3:21:54] <+ThatButler> The ear just disappeared while rolling
[3:22:08] <critfumble_> oh but she can run in cutscenes
[3:22:12] <codycurry52> easy mode didn't slow that down lol I'll defend this game , but that is bad
[3:22:18] <HyperBomb21> he put that mine
[3:22:32] <%MajorDub> i don't know, i just can't find a giant monster with a rocket launcher scary
[3:22:32] <shevan123> this is slightly upsetting
[3:22:37] <+Eddy21forsaken> how'd Jill not trip that claymore mine
[3:22:49] <EuropanLamprey> The story is janky
[3:22:57] <HyperBomb21> Carlos is hot so he's cool in my book
[3:23:05] <CyberDingus> Carlos is hairy.
[3:23:10] <Charlie99993> @Eddy21forsaken you see it turn on after she passes it, so he must have turned it on remotely
[3:23:10] <+ThatButler> The bad start, he hit on her, she rebuked him
[3:23:13] <$doomp12> did they just lead nemesis to all the civilians on the train? again?
[3:23:13] <critfumble_> the whole of re story is janky LUL
[3:23:26] <LunarRemix> Lol
[3:23:26] <EuropanLamprey> He is hot
[3:23:30] <xxshadowxx416> Carlos cool
[3:23:31] <CyberDingus> 8 inches eh?
[3:23:37] <arkv01> 8 inches huh :)
[3:23:37] <%MajorDub> oh yeah, don't think too much about the plot of re
[3:24:09] <HyperBomb21> Okay~
[3:24:10] <LunarRemix> I want someone to write a good story where all the characters are just ugly. Like a Shounen that's really interesting but everyone is butt-ugly.
[3:24:13] <%Samex_Comex> Get a haircut Carlos
[3:24:17] <TheImmortal70> woolieless would be a tragedy
[3:24:20] <arkv01> woolieless BibleThump
[3:24:23] <+Eddy21forsaken> LUL
[3:24:27] <HyperBomb21> I want carlos to tease me
[3:24:28] <Chatterbox1991> An Eliless World is a true lovecraftian dystopia
[3:24:29] <TheImmortal70> WOO lie less
[3:24:31] <Yummy_Nukes> an eli-less world would be a sad one
[3:24:34] <TheImmortal70> It just is fun to say
[3:24:34] <critfumble_> look at all these civies we've saved
[3:24:39] <srkAres> man, a woolie-less world would suck. no one to make fun of
[3:24:40] <critfumble_> in this train car
[3:24:48] <Sunstalker> Carlos is the master of fisting danK
[3:25:06] <Charlie99993> eliless
[3:25:30] <CyberDingus> Funny how TWO Russian men spoke privatelly, with each other, in English.
[3:25:41] <shevan123> im evil and russian, oh no
[3:25:42] <CyberDingus> Suppose they want to practice 24\7
[3:25:44] <Yummy_Nukes> that's why I put a - in between them
[3:25:48] <arkv01> HIS Squid1 CAN DO THAT?
[3:25:52] <SilverRoddo> Nemesisness
[3:25:57] <%MajorDub> was that...a call out to air force one?
[3:25:58] <TheImmortal70> He's so angry and happy at the same time
[3:25:58] <mizamar> they always make the russian the evil one smh
[3:26:06] <Goergorion> Get off my lawn!
[3:26:07] <+ThatButler> They're just Rushing these story beat moods.
[3:26:09] <EuropanLamprey> "Welp, I'm dead, better go out cool"
[3:26:14] <Charlie99993> But the good one was also russian
[3:26:15] <+forgetme000> why does Nemesis grab him?
[3:26:15] <shevan123> i wish they kept in the idea of defeating him would get you pieces of a gun
[3:26:18] <Jinrya_the_Red_Wizard> more than the original game
[3:26:25] <critfumble_> I like how it's on sight for Jill she was about to just run up and throat punch nem
[3:26:28] <HyperBomb21> Gotta at least get inside the police station
[3:26:37] <ECRead> it would be too!
[3:26:51] <$vampireinarm> well he is
[3:26:51] <CaptainFrankincense> gramps needs pussy too
[3:26:52] <HyperBomb21> They succeeded

[3:27:03] <mslizard> He needs a haircut
[3:27:06] <Explodincatz> i love his hair
[3:27:06] <%MajorDub> i'm sorry, i'd still be chasing puss even as an old man over wanting to die in an explosion
[3:27:07] <ElkRiverDog> To be fair it is a kick ass thing for a tombstone
[3:27:14] <+rytyoung> It reminds me of my haircut LUL
[3:27:15] <Chatterbox1991> same -_-
[3:27:15] <%Rezca> Oh god, Plague used to be gd Hot

[3:27:22] <mizamar> Plague used to have hair?
[3:27:22] <SuperVaderMan> Carlos is literally Eli, got it

[3:29:14] <BrachyZoid> "Probably some angry ex girlfriend"
