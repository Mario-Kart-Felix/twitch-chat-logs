[0:06:25] <arkv01> I guess the apocalypse sped things up
[0:06:37] <%JantDarvus> I think there must have been a delay between last game and this one to have time for them to start the argent energy shit again or whatever caused SUDDENLY DEMONS on Earth
[0:06:42] <+Manjove> i thought the UAC was a government agency?
[0:06:47] <arkv01> did we meet hayden yet?

[0:11:26] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> d
[0:11:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> the rip and the tearing
[0:11:34] <hntronium> So is everything still complicated so far or have you finally gotten into the groove of things?
[0:11:45] <arkv01> touch and lick everything
[0:11:47] <jsikandere> do you suppose anyone will ever have the heart to make a hdoom mod for this?
[0:11:48] <arkv01> leave nothing unslobbered
[0:11:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> How hard is Doom Slayer through all of this adventure
[0:12:16] <TheAsylumCat> @sonofthedeepsouth maximum
[0:12:32] <hntronium> He is always at maximum hardness for the demon killing
[0:12:43] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> oh that does not look good
[0:12:44] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> jesus
[0:13:11] <+Punishedkaiger> Ow, oof, my bones

[0:13:35] <hntronium> It gives you the hardest boner
[0:13:57] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> i haven't watched much, were there many of these slow sections
[0:13:59] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> ?
[0:14:23] <TheAsylumCat> one would think fighting for your life would give you one hell of a erection
[0:14:45] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueImoya no talking about boners chat
[0:14:48] <+heroicspiritavenger> I’m surprised to see you have the coordination to play this @plagueofgripes you seem to prefer slower, more methodical, and calculated gameplay
[0:14:52] <sonofthedeepsouth> yup
[0:14:58] <TheAsylumCat> probably were blood lust comes from
[0:15:01] <Daksaysso> Slimer?!

[0:17:52] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Protip, all secrets are usually solvable when you encounter them

[0:24:28] <rdddy> is this dark souls?
[0:24:44] <arkv01> hes gonna chill
[0:24:46] <arkv01> for another few decade
[0:25:49] <rdddy> what difficulty is he playin on?
[0:25:58] <+kiwiredgrave> impregnation is more apt
[0:25:58] <SadisticAphid60> this is starting to look like halo
[0:26:27] <sosuke5> Silently...with a lot of noise!
[0:26:28] <arkv01> yeah I'm not a super big fan of this level's design
[0:30:40] <Probablyhenrik> I think the skull floor is just decorative
[0:31:48] <CaptHat211> Hello strangers
[0:32:06] <HelghastTroop> oh hey what up!
[0:32:25] <Jrockoni> everybody's still debating on what the symbol of evil should be.
[0:32:36] <Jrockoni> gotta make it cool to convert the kids
[0:32:47] <HelghastTroop> its a picture of jeff bezoz Kappa @Jrockoni
[0:33:05] <Probablyhenrik> a cross made with L's
[0:33:41] <Sorvadi> @Probablyhenrik oh you
[0:33:44] <+twohitgood> the shield guys kinda look like the old zombie sergeants (shotgun guys).
[0:34:07] <jsikandere> go o where the cool dumb thing was
[0:34:12] <HelghastTroop> yea preety much the idea was to replicate the look as many of old doom eneimies as possible
[0:35:00] <HelghastTroop> @PlagueOfGripes fair warning there are alot of parts in this game where you have to jump around sides of cliffs
[0:35:37] <Jrockoni> everytime I see doom guys hands I feel like hes hitting the point of buff where bathroom time becomes....a new kind of challenge.
[0:36:12] <GaspidarIII> finally. got a notification you were live but didnt see you anywhere
[0:36:22] <HelghastTroop> doom guys muscels make me think of chris red field in resi 5
[0:36:36] <arkv01> his ass is probably similarly muscularly so he won't accidentally rip and tear
[0:37:11] <Jrockoni> boy needs that charman ULTRA STRONG
[0:37:27] <HelghastTroop> doom guy dont got time for shits, hes so efficent he doenst make any waste with his food
[0:37:31] <outrage_swampert> gotta spin back on the monkey bar
[0:38:47] <HelghastTroop> there are alot of video game going on huh
[0:39:20] <HelghastTroop> im a big fan of that spped boost
[0:39:26] <HelghastTroop> you so damn fast
[0:39:40] <arkv01> absorb the demon energies
[0:40:01] <howimaginary> yo
[0:40:29] <HelghastTroop> @PlagueOfGripes g key is default to switch
[0:41:05] <Jrockoni> anyone else hoping the cube from doom 3 comes back?
[0:41:41] <HelghastTroop> @Jrockoni you did see it in the last game
[0:41:48] <HelghastTroop> it wa on haydens desk
[0:42:23] <Jrockoni> oh yeah. but now we must wield the devils Rubics cube.
[0:42:50] <howimaginary> snap there necks >:)
[0:43:49] <HelghastTroop> the rocket launcher looks goofy as fuck with the big skull on the side
[0:44:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:44:28] <arkv01> roombas?

[0:44:46] <fluffy_sauce> doom slayer sort of killed vega; not really though
[0:45:17] <HelghastTroop> eli wants to read a 5 page store on why the doom mouser exists
[0:45:35] <Dingo_Eejit> Shit I'm late, were there just Scutters?
[0:45:48] <Sorvadi> Well if you read the novelization of DOOm you'll find the Roombas have a rich lore
[0:47:25] <Jrockoni> will plague draw the doom snek?
[0:47:28] <HelghastTroop> okay i just lost breath with laughter over "gentle lad"
[0:47:30] <zepie__> Do a barrel roll.
[0:48:25] <ProfessorLuigi> Watch the life leave your enemy's eyes?
[0:50:00] <khotgor> Missed the baby spider demons
[0:50:35] <HelghastTroop> you talkin about the trikes from doom 3?
[0:50:48] <HelghastTroop> those was gross me out
[0:50:50] <khotgor> No, but those were also adorable
[0:51:15] <HelghastTroop> they just a head with little bug legs stikin out
[0:51:53] <khotgor> Imagine the faces being porcelain dolls walking around with 8 mini-hands
[0:52:01] <+Cook_4_Souls> hello
[0:52:15] <HelghastTroop> thats too much head for me
[0:53:17] <khotgor> Don't like the idea of soul-stealing eyes clapping around with spider-like baby hands with its soulless expression?
[0:54:55] <HelghastTroop> its always ammusing watching the hamster wheel in plagues mind begin to rotate
[0:56:19] <aduvan11> did you sacrifice a goat today, perhaps?
[0:56:19] <+HarbingerWolf117> Any wall climb panels?
[0:56:31] <SirMcSlushy> On the right?
[0:56:34] <+Punishedkaiger> You probably need one of the other rune upgrades
[0:56:41] <+lorekoo> Just time your double jumps and dashes better. Patience
[0:56:58] <HelghastTroop> its just eli having one of his boomer moments LUL
[0:57:21] <stfn893> plagueFace
[0:57:22] <+HarbingerWolf117> But better :V
[0:57:43] <+HarbingerWolf117> KILL EM ALL
[0:58:15] <stfn893> What is with the maylay being so non existent
[0:58:18] <HelghastTroop> they dont mind being blasted to pieces
[0:58:24] <HelghastTroop> they love it infact XD
[0:58:34] <sad_toast_> not even a second thought lol Cultist s? well y'all gotta die
[0:59:10] <+HarbingerWolf117> wtf are those things? Besides what Jester summons in DMC3
[0:59:14] <SirMcSlushy> Hawt
[0:59:21] <+Punishedkaiger> They fear the shotty
[0:59:32] <+HarbingerWolf117> Read da item descriptions :V
[0:59:40] <Waypastfuture> what stage is this?
[0:59:49] <Waypastfuture> or mission idk the terminology
[0:59:50] <sad_toast_> pump and double barrel
[0:59:52] <HelghastTroop> time to for plague to go get the family shotgun from the barn
[0:59:57] <khotgor> Keep the super shotgun, replace the regular shotgun with a plasma shotgun
[0:59:58] <+twohitgood> like the song goes "traditioooon"
[1:00:09] <SirMcSlushy> Shenanigans
[1:00:09] <khotgor> Regular Shotgun is just subpar Super Shotgun
[1:00:26] <sad_toast_> make it more confusing and ad a level action shotgun
[1:00:38] <$doomp12> WARNING-this area sucks
[1:01:52] <HelghastTroop> all this little boy wants is to saw i giant brain spider in half
[1:01:56] <+HarbingerWolf117> If you do get 3 dont waste it on a mancubus, the animation is really anti climatic
[1:02:45] <r14x> hell thought they were nifty
[1:02:48] <+HarbingerWolf117> I think they use them to to transfer fuel or some shit
[1:02:52] <khotgor> Looks like cueball is just a zombie that inhaled too many canisters
[1:03:07] <+twohitgood> the demons liked the aesthetic and decided to do it to more humans.
[1:03:18] <+HarbingerWolf117> It explained in the codex, interestingly they seem to retcon the spectre's codex entry
[1:04:09] <r14x> they just grabbed canisters and ran to the nearest human about to demonized just bc they thought it was funny
[1:04:47] <+HarbingerWolf117> I keep forgetting to dash before i grab it
[1:05:08] <SirMcSlushy> Ah videos games, always a question of 'who designed this shit'
[1:06:14] <khotgor> Time for monocle plague?
[1:06:30] <Make_me_mad> I had a similar problem playing Nioh 2. Playing it in the morning and started having trouble focusing, then got a blind/distorted spot right in the center of my vision. Followed by a huge migraine and lots of vomiting, so you know. Hopefully yours doesn't get that bad.
[1:07:30] <+HarbingerWolf117> Ooooo boi you're gonna need more armor later on
[1:08:10] <+HarbingerWolf117> I went for max ammo but it still seems half of what you had in doom 2016
[1:08:22] <MrHappyFunshine> Utility is always uesful
[1:09:20] <cap_bon> Are you enough of a gamer to do one of our challenges? there soooo hard
[1:10:25] <khotgor> This game looks more colourful/arcady than Doom 2016. Which is strange since Doom 2016 felt like that
[1:10:40] <EuropanLamprey> Plop
[1:11:15] <Make_me_mad> This feels like Darksiders and Far Cry: Blood Dragon had a baby.
[1:11:43] <r14x> this movement looks really fun actualy
[1:11:59] <cap_bon> god this is some video game shit
[1:12:19] <MrHappyFunshine> Appreciate the demon designs in this compared to 2016
[1:12:34] <+RandomDefault> howdy ho, Plague
[1:12:44] <+RandomDefault> How you finding the game some far?
[1:12:47] <khotgor> 2016 demons felt like World of Warcraft designs
[1:12:54] <+HarbingerWolf117> They done a real good job modernising some of the retro ones
[1:13:20] <r14x> i liked the 2016 deisngs
[1:13:56] <+HarbingerWolf117> I think the possessed soldiers looked way better in 2016
[1:14:14] <cap_bon> Oh its this bit from the trailer
[1:14:27] <+HarbingerWolf117> They went from acid attack zambo demons to 80's jobber
[1:14:31] <r14x> DOOT
[1:14:44] <Waypastfuture> yeah iluminist movement made a bunch of shit up to denounce how bad the churcj was
[1:14:54] <khotgor> I'd play a Doom game where you were just a Revenant
[1:15:02] <MrHappyFunshine> The possesed soldier designs in 16 weren't bad, them and the summoners i'd say were the best designs
[1:15:08] <+HarbingerWolf117> no
[1:15:26] <+HarbingerWolf117> For battle mode
[1:15:31] <+RandomDefault> Those are for the multiplayer battle mode
[1:15:36] <+HarbingerWolf117> you can play as all sorts of demons
[1:15:51] <khotgor> I remember when Revenants were high-tier enemies. They were never the same post-2
[1:16:00] <cap_bon> more sub systems
[1:16:17] <+RandomDefault> PLague
[1:16:28] <+RandomDefault> Thjose controls are for Battlemode
[1:17:26] <khotgor> Quake is just better doom
[1:17:30] <r14x> that would have
[1:17:40] <+HarbingerWolf117> Speaking of Quake, have you been in Doomguys private quarters yet?
[1:18:04] <cap_bon> Tribes now thats a game I havent thought about in years
[1:18:46] <r14x> is there no vertical thrust?
[1:19:04] <+HarbingerWolf117> Jetpack up to the floaty platform
[1:19:26] <+HarbingerWolf117> You hold the button down
[1:19:51] <+HarbingerWolf117> Its like Halo Reach's jetpack
[1:20:01] <r14x> hes such a good boy
[1:21:16] <cap_bon> is this bullet storm now
[1:22:15] <khotgor> Those are literal monster closets
[1:22:29] <+HarbingerWolf117> Do you reckon they were fuckin in there?
[1:22:35] <khotgor> Yes
[1:22:49] <+RandomDefault> Yes
[1:23:27] <khotgor> ... why does the cueball demon feel like a birthday cake
[1:23:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:24:03] <cap_bon> damn flying idiot bubbles
[1:24:23] <hypersongi> this is doom. You are not allowed to stand around and leave anything alone. its always kill every demon.
[1:24:24] <LunarRemix> I want to watch you Plague but ProjectMelody is also streaming and she's a novel new thing I am curious about.
[1:24:57] <khotgor> Happy birthday demon
[1:25:12] <cap_bon> nooo my boney arms dont jam them into my mouth
[1:25:25] <NatsuDFTRev30> doomslayer stripping
[1:27:33] <turbofolk> i con of sin?
[1:27:35] <khotgor> That looks like some Doom 3 architecture
[1:27:40] <cap_bon> why did we build a hallway with falling axes again ?
[1:29:12] <turbofolk> How do you like Doom eternal so far plague??

[1:31:49] <+Punishedkaiger> You missed a secret in that room
[1:31:54] <Fenlig> Plague, if you had to draw something from the doom universe what would it be?
[1:32:39] <khotgor> Hentai is coming from the floor
[1:32:46] <cap_bon> "Yes and over here is where I want my crusher hallway to be installed"
[1:34:30] <khotgor> Don't want to draw Doom 3's Vagary?
[1:35:41] <ralphwiggum16> hi plague!
[1:35:47] <ralphwiggum16> You are SO COOL
[1:35:56] <ralphwiggum16> It's... dare I say...
[1:36:04] <ralphwiggum16> amazing?
[1:36:30] <cap_bon> Is the recharging flamethrower and chainsaw the games way of having the design benefits of regenerating health without actually saying its regenerating health
[1:36:50] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, can you please kill more monsters? I'm beginning to think you're not cool anymore.
[1:37:43] <hypersongi> I thought the point was to cycle weapons. "this one is good against the spikey ones. and this one is real good against the penis ones." sort of thing
[1:38:07] <%not_crabby> no you just use whatever weapon has ammo in it
[1:38:10] <ralphwiggum16> Classic Plague, overthinking everything.
[1:38:22] <Stillchr> Animal crossing is looking pretty cool
[1:38:36] <r14x> rip and tear poopy butthiole
[1:38:37] <Fenlig> Plague have you seen the goofie looking fish creatures in this map?
[1:38:38] <alphonseisbest> Yeah hugo nerfed the super shottty cuz he said he hated howplayers could solo 2016 with just
[1:39:09] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes This took me forever, you have to activate the thing below you
[1:39:52] <Fenlig> @PlagueOfGripes theres a funny secret on the right side cliff there
[1:40:03] <%not_crabby> is it this cliff?
[1:40:10] <%not_crabby> not the beginning cliff?
[1:40:17] <Fenlig> Theres multiple
[1:40:27] <khotgor> Mancubus is bloated with sex appeal
[1:40:28] <ralphwiggum16> Holy shit, man. You're 100% right.
[1:40:45] <ralphwiggum16> This has always been my problem with Doom, not enough sexy monsters
[1:40:46] <+personmanthingg> hi im johnny doomguy i like long walks on the beach AND RIPPING AND TEARING DEMONS TILL THERES NONE LEFT

[1:41:05] <cap_bon> Wheres Khan I dont wanna be taunted by no skeleton fucker I want her or it
[1:42:31] <ralphwiggum16> Say it
[1:42:52] <hypersongi> Doomguy seems like a really understandable person. He's only got 1 personality
[1:43:12] <Futurecity10> further right
[1:43:17] <Fenlig> other side
[1:43:34] <ralphwiggum16> he's somewhat 1-dimensional but he gets the job done
[1:43:41] <Fenlig> Hes too powerful for you

[1:45:28] <cap_bon> Sequence breaking is the height of game design
[1:45:57] <khotgor> Climbing up the wall seems demonic
[1:46:04] <+twohitgood> it seems very spider-y when he climbs.
[1:46:26] <hypersongi> Wall climbing is from not-Doom. But they added it because reasons.
[1:46:30] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, do you identify with Doomguy?
[1:46:34] <Streetshark_> I dont know if this is better than H-doom
[1:47:17] <khotgor> Does that mean that doomguy is four-headed?
[1:48:00] <ralphwiggum16> nah, it's gonna turn out he's just the guy from Doom 1
[1:48:12] <cap_bon> wait hes not the original doom guy whos been stuck in hell until time reset?
[1:48:21] <ralphwiggum16> the plot in these games is always satire like that.
[1:48:24] <+polypolipauli> Picard would realize this is all just force field projection, holography, and transporter effects. Why can't doom guy solve this in a court room?
[1:48:29] <CaptHat211> *BOING BOING*
[1:48:57] <ralphwiggum16> that monster is pretty sexy
[1:49:01] <CaptHat211> My grandmother has the same kind of door.
[1:49:08] <Streetshark_> hell has great dental
[1:50:02] <CaptHat211> Shove his staff up where the sun don't shine
[1:50:03] <peachy996> "Protect me in my time of need minions"
[1:50:09] <peachy996> Brave Deag
[1:50:18] <hypersongi> Just because you're a demon doesnt mean you can neglect flossing.
[1:50:24] <Streetshark_> Thanks Oscar
[1:50:30] <cap_bon> Dare you enter my piss yellow magical realm Doom Slayer
[1:50:33] <+PleasantLee> Eli would be my most favourite doom slayer. so indignant to the enemy. "there, I beat you now. you special princess"
[1:50:48] <Ardyn_1zunia> Coin for much rip and many tear
[1:51:27] <CaptHat211> I KICK ASS FOR THE LORD
[1:51:49] <Ardyn_1zunia> Game is going to have you playing the piano on your keyboard by the end of this game with it's many keybinds
[1:51:58] <khotgor> Maybe Doomguy (angry marine) turning into the Doomslayer(alien special cornflakes marine) was a Bethesda thing
[1:52:19] <Ardyn_1zunia> No spoilers but that gets answered later in the game
[1:52:48] <Streetshark_> maybe doomslayer is secretly gohan
[1:53:04] <CaptHat211> They're no longer men.
[1:53:15] <khotgor> Doomslayer is actually dragonborn
[1:53:16] <cap_bon> Never being allowed to use your super shooty because you need shotgun grenades for idiot bubbles sucks
[1:53:31] <peachy996> Tactical Scope is a wonder in this game so far. Not what I expected
[1:53:50] <%deeschlemp451> hey guys. how goes the infernal summer camp?
[1:54:08] <peachy996> Looks like Haste
[1:54:14] <whiteZORA> the secret make you faster
[1:55:00] <+Heart0fInk> You uploading this to UToob Plague?
[1:55:01] <khotgor> Secret = Haste
[1:55:24] <CaptHat211> Who would you say is your favorite kind of Hell's minions to kill, Eli?
[1:56:03] <+Heart0fInk> Because marketing
[1:56:03] <khotgor> Because its easy and doesn't require thought, plague
[1:56:05] <CaptHat211> MONEY
[1:56:15] <alphonseisbest> Thats nit canon tho
[1:56:21] <Streetshark_> cuz you can make a lot of stuff and you dont have to set it up
[1:56:23] <alphonseisbest> Not
[1:56:25] <%Gogogolem> Its basically so writers can write and not have to worry about other writers.
[1:56:27] <+Heart0fInk> Multiverses are fucking stupid
[1:56:28] <peachy996> And now I must leave because everyone is further than me now
[1:56:33] <hypersongi> Because it allows "creative IP"
[1:56:35] <DuoMaxwell64> Multiple versions of Spider-Men teaming up has always been a thing, it was a even a story arc in the original 90s Spider-Man TAS. *cough*
[1:56:38] <approachingdeath> TIME is convoluted....and shit
[1:56:49] <cap_bon> but what if the character was evil wooooo
[1:56:49] <theamazingroberto> i WISH it would revolve around my dick
[1:56:50] <hypersongi> and you can remove and add which ones are good and bad
[1:56:54] <khotgor> Timetravel and Multiverses are the worst
[1:57:07] <+Heart0fInk> How you liking the game so far?
[1:57:09] <%deeschlemp451> The only comics I like and I don't know if they have multiverse counterparts are lobo and spawn
[1:57:18] <alphonseisbest> But my dick is bigger and stronger
[1:57:51] <DuoMaxwell64> Fair enough
[1:58:05] <+Heart0fInk> The multiverse thing has always felt really 'Fanfic-y' to me
[1:59:05] <khotgor> Frosty
[1:59:47] <%deeschlemp451> combining the respawning barrels with the barrels dropping stuff feels like a good combo
[1:59:54] <hypersongi> The dash upgrate for speed runners maybe
[2:01:07] <r14x> liar
[2:01:16] <cap_bon> I wonder if there would ever be an option/difficlut that made the loop more similar to 2016
[2:01:30] <DoostCola> not stupid!
[2:01:34] <khotgor> I bet there are doom minecraft mods
[2:01:38] <LunarRemix> I remember being 10 and showing a ride I made to my irl friend and being so happy that I made something
[2:01:44] <+Jumpie8> wait you played minecraft?
[2:02:42] <FaceRekt> Uhh, yeah
[2:02:42] <+Punishedkaiger> Absolutely
[2:02:44] <RiverBirch> I mean
[2:02:48] <LunarRemix> If the pay is good.
[2:02:51] <RiverBirch> If i wasnt gonna get set on fire
[2:02:52] <khotgor> Does the factory require me to parkour and climb up walls every day?
[2:02:57] <RiverBirch> sure
[2:03:03] <%deeschlemp451> only if the coffee machine was a human ribcage
[2:03:06] <hypersongi> Skulls are cool. Lets try and build ALL THE ARCHITECTURE with skulls.
[2:03:16] <+Jumpie8> it's still better then where I work Kappa
[2:03:46] <ralphwiggum16> How do you feel about the fact that there aren't any goblins in the game?
[2:04:00] <+Punishedkaiger> It's the weapon points you bought
[2:04:01] <RiverBirch> Upgrades?
[2:05:40] <cap_bon> Does it feel kinda weird to have 1 ups in doom
[2:06:36] <ralphwiggum16> is that solaire?
[2:06:46] <ralphwiggum16> if so fuck him
[2:06:51] <tigerd23> yes
[2:06:53] <ralphwiggum16> The sun fucked me over.
[2:07:12] <khotgor> Solaire is giving away demon coins instead of sun coins
[2:07:27] <Ardyn_1zunia> Remember to use your weapon upgrade coins
[2:07:48] <ralphwiggum16> I think they're cute
[2:08:04] <Ardyn_1zunia> And the other coin next to it are Mastery tokens that let you skip the final weapon challenge to fully upgrade a gun. You won't get them till endgame
[2:08:28] <ralphwiggum16> COOL
[2:08:59] <ralphwiggum16> Plague this is the coolest fight ever will you be my dad?
[2:09:25] <khotgor> Pinky's in this are just pigs in gladiator armor
[2:12:45] <ralphwiggum16> Watching this battle is making me rethink my perspective on life.
[2:12:59] <ralphwiggum16> This right here, this is what's important
[2:13:23] <BillieNoMates> Thats the same as 2016
[2:13:31] <BillieNoMates> Early on, ammo was a bit rough
[2:13:58] <+OBrew> !uptime
[2:13:59] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 14 minutes 8 seconds
[2:14:12] <khotgor> So Doomslayer is from the dinosaur era. Does that make him reptilian?
[2:14:15] <theaudacityofthisb> How are you finding the "this gun solves this problem mechanic"?
[2:16:07] <FaceRekt> Sounding more and more like Warhams 40k as we go along
[2:16:13] <jellssssss20> Hi Plague how's things going?
[2:16:14] <ralphwiggum16> It's gonna turn out to be bullshit.
[2:16:29] <+cinder_chan> PLAAAAAAGUE
[2:16:33] <+cinder_chan> <3
[2:16:40] <khotgor> Hey look, a Necron Destroyer
[2:17:03] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, who do you think best personifies your idea of rage?
[2:17:05] <jellssssss20> Just came from Pat doing this same level lol
[2:17:22] <YakumoYomi> Pat's about to finish up, so expect a big influx of people in the next 10 minutes or so.
[2:17:25] <j0ustar> jumping from Rip & Tear to Rip & Tear
[2:18:15] <ralphwiggum16> i'm gonna call him florpy
[2:18:23] <+cinder_chan> am I the only one a little sad we didn't get to fight our way out of hell for the first level?
[2:19:04] <ralphwiggum16> yeah where does this game take place?
[2:19:16] <Victory_Boss> erf
[2:19:28] <khotgor> Necron Destroyer
[2:19:30] <jellssssss20> Earth
[2:19:35] <+TIME_PUNCHER> @ralphwiggum16 earth and some other planets
[2:19:38] <ralphwiggum16> hopefully it's some type of goblin
[2:19:57] <%JJCheeker> psaGoblin
[2:19:59] <ralphwiggum16> like is this earth?
[2:20:24] <+TIME_PUNCHER> nah, doom 2016 lore planet
[2:20:32] <jellssssss20> This is like, Antartica or the Arctic yeah
[2:20:40] <+TIME_PUNCHER> wait it is?
[2:20:47] <+TIME_PUNCHER> derp
[2:21:57] <MassConnect> i find the lack of gripes disturbing
[2:22:11] <jellssssss20> That popping sound when you got the headshot lol
[2:23:19] <MyNameIsRasus> These names are kind of silly
[2:23:31] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:24:07] <chhdez> Bill Hellgates
[2:24:38] <jellssssss20> See, somehow it's in both polar caps at once
[2:25:10] <khotgor> Doom Bethesda
[2:25:10] <MyNameIsRasus> "Which polar cap do you want your fortress on?" "Yes"
[2:25:14] <Rada150> they are running aprotection racket but double cross you in the end
[2:25:17] <Maids4lyfe> hell is like a living organism, demons are hell's antibodies
[2:25:19] <ralphwiggum16> there's a bunch of animals and they're all having a little tea party in a field.
[2:25:28] <khotgor> Doom Bethesda's world seems more confusing and dumb than any of the previous versions
[2:25:32] <ralphwiggum16> one of them spilled some tea, and it turned into Doom
[2:25:33] <MKUltima> This is just Gnosticism brought to its logical conclusion
[2:26:02] <Maids4lyfe> Bethesda didn't write anything
[2:26:08] <Maids4lyfe> this was made by iD
[2:26:10] <CygnusRoboticus> Confession: I came from pat's stream. The lack of story depth in this game is seriously hurting my enjoyment
[2:26:15] <MyNameIsRasus> Except for the Lusty Argonian Maid
[2:26:24] <friozen> plague, drawn some naughty things
[2:26:38] <CygnusRoboticus> It seems to be more of a videogame-ass videogame and it IRRITATES me to an extreme degree
[2:26:54] <Victory_Boss> Air slow down for style
[2:26:54] <ralphwiggum16> Cygnus, I think the point is the story isn't important
[2:27:23] <khotgor> The story isn't important, but forces the player to deal with not-optimus prime in his office room during 2016
[2:27:26] <CygnusRoboticus> @ralphwiggum16 I don't like that
[2:27:57] <j0ustar> This game is just like Doomguy = RIP&TEAR first, care for context second if at all
[2:28:16] <jellssssss20> Rosario Dawson has been cast as Ahsoka Tano in season 2 of Mando
[2:28:21] <ralphwiggum16> we know
[2:28:39] <CygnusRoboticus> I like of liked the story of 2016, and if eternal decides "lol videogame" the entire way through I'll be really upset
[2:29:11] <cap_bon> does this game have a weapon choice slow down like enter the gungeon ?
[2:30:46] <+fizzguy47> @cap_bon yes
[2:31:02] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, what do you think of the more religious implications of this game?
[2:31:14] <cap_bon> cool thats a good feature
[2:31:42] <ralphwiggum16> Dude, this game is SO COOL
[2:33:33] <Victory_Boss> very pungent delivery
[2:33:47] <khotgor> Just rescure lobsters and send them to pat's
[2:33:59] <whittacre> it's because if you don't they're poisonous
[2:34:04] <SleepyMaribo> @PlagueOfGripes what difficulty are you playing on? i started on nightmare and boy wasi not ready.
[2:34:04] <RiverBirch> I read a weird article saying that Lobsters have a sort of immortality to them.
[2:34:11] <Rada150> that happens to all slaugher animals hough
[2:34:29] <cap_bon> Nature really wants to evolve crabs for some reason
[2:34:53] <Cosbones> I actually had trouble enjoying the 2016 Doom levels because I was always worrying about where the secrets were.
[2:35:26] <Victory_Boss> Can you shoot the claw at climbable walls?
[2:35:41] <khotgor> Crabs are cool
[2:36:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's pretty neat how that circular platform caught your fall every time, nice design that
[2:37:59] <khotgor> I can't wait until the next doom game has dragons in it
[2:38:06] <arkv01> I hope doombaby didn't rip n tear outta the uterus
[2:38:32] <Exadata_> I like it better when it was a really pissed of guy killing demons because they killed his rabbit
[2:38:37] <InterestingTitle> Born via D-section
[2:39:03] <khotgor> Doomguy probably has a bunny fursuit
[2:39:12] <cap_bon> "Its me I hope you saved shotgun ammo for my dumb flying ass"
[2:39:24] <ralphwiggum16> I'm sure Doomguy is a lovely person who treats his mother very well
[2:39:36] <InterestingTitle> Most likely tbh
[2:40:04] <InterestingTitle> Nice fellow unless you’re a demon or a superior officer ordering him to harm civilians
[2:40:55] <Rada150> that's a warhammer 40k thing
[2:40:56] <ralphwiggum16> skulls are cool
[2:40:58] <Rada150> skull droids
[2:40:59] <khotgor> the skull droids are the empire's probe droids from strike's back
[2:41:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's like trigger and drills, you just gotta
[2:41:22] <+Punishedkaiger> Fear the old blood
[2:41:24] <ralphwiggum16> yharnam is pretty cool too
[2:41:29] <bloodlusthonour> we need the lore significance of the footpath tiles m8
[2:41:41] <ralphwiggum16> Thanks Steve Jobs
[2:41:43] <+Gifferjesus> you are
[2:41:54] <cap_bon> gonna feel so good to remove that guys head
[2:41:56] <khotgor> You aren't. Doomguy =/= Doomslayer
[2:42:02] <LunarRemix> How could this be the same guy who was just a marine who went against orders to shoot civilians?
[2:42:27] <DickChapyGaming> Doomguy actually is the Doomslayer. this game refers to him as both interchangeably
[2:43:39] <ralphwiggum16> the same could be said for a lot of people, Plague
[2:43:41] <Cosbones> Spend a possibly infinite amount of time in Hell and alternate realities killing demons and you get changed.
[2:43:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't give up skeleton
[2:43:51] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:44:14] <cap_bon> who filled those lasers with burn hurting energy
[2:45:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> intense music in the background as you wait for a laser to stop
[2:45:25] <cumurasame> Eli is playing a game instead of drawing furries? What timeline is this?
[2:45:29] <Victory_Boss> Kellogs Crusadero's
[2:45:37] <ralphwiggum16> Solaire's crunch
[2:45:39] <+Nightshade1356> coin crunch?
[2:45:51] <khotgor> Steroids in you puffs
[2:46:08] <ralphwiggum16> I don't know if that phrase is kid friendly
[2:46:26] <cap_bon> when was my pee pee chromed
[2:47:05] <cumurasame> I think by then everyone would be playing RE3 of FF7 on repeat, heck people are kind of doing that already with their demos alone
[2:47:20] <cap_bon> gonna stream ff7 renamke or jsut enjoying it off stream?
[2:47:57] <cumurasame> These snakes can do reppukens!?
[2:48:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this game almost has as many skulls as the darksiders games, impressive
[2:48:42] <khotgor> These sneks are not doing it for me.
[2:48:43] <+Punishedkaiger> Weapon points to upgrade your guns
[2:49:11] <cap_bon> these sneks lack waifu potential
[2:50:01] <silenthillbookofmammaries> heat blast is pretty nice
[2:50:16] <khotgor> A lot of the weapon upgrades at times feels like subpar options in comparison to other ones
[2:50:45] <silenthillbookofmammaries> try a lower difficulty if you're not having fun
[2:50:52] <silenthillbookofmammaries> we wont judge you
[2:51:22] <tigerd23> yep fishyLIT
[2:51:37] <cap_bon> dont worry they built a special sand pit for you to have fun in the doom tower
[2:52:06] <silenthillbookofmammaries> talk about it for 30 minutes
[2:52:52] <Rahsed> Donkey Kong Eternal Kappa
[2:53:02] <silenthillbookofmammaries> be a gymnast plague
[2:53:07] <silenthillbookofmammaries> thats what doom is all about
[2:53:20] <+fizzguy47> ledge
[2:53:30] <+Punishedkaiger> There's ledge space next to you plague
[2:53:42] <khotgor> overthinking too much
[2:53:46] <silenthillbookofmammaries> scamper like a spider monkey
[2:54:01] <bordingcrazy> You will be fine on the edge
[2:54:04] <+fizzguy47> right
[2:54:15] <silenthillbookofmammaries> YAY
[2:54:32] <silenthillbookofmammaries> its so obvious, jump in the red death lightning
[2:55:04] <khotgor> hug the red lightning. It longs to course your body
[2:55:07] <silenthillbookofmammaries> grab that commemerative plate
[2:55:42] <+TreeeFOX> this game. is kinda bad sometimes
[2:55:43] <silenthillbookofmammaries> yep
[2:56:01] <Korndogg10> !uptime
[2:56:01] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 56 minutes 10 seconds
[2:56:08] <silenthillbookofmammaries> head back dawg
[2:56:10] <Rahsed> Well this was a secret so this is just to get back I guess?
[2:56:20] <+fizzguy47> towards the green thing
[2:56:46] <medril07> hello
[2:56:51] <khotgor> Yey, necron destroyer
[2:56:58] <jellssssss20> His arm looked pimply
[2:56:58] <Rahsed> LUL
[2:57:14] <khotgor> Ok, this is like the fifth, sixth fucking time they showed off necron demon before tossing him away
[2:57:15] <creed_tactical_genius> no skin care for demons BibleThump
[2:57:49] <silenthillbookofmammaries> the result of plague's genetic farm experiments
[2:57:53] <+fizzguy47> secret in this area
[2:58:02] <+TreeeFOX> that UI looks like its straight out of XBOX.
[2:58:06] <silenthillbookofmammaries> the metal age is every age in doom
[2:58:25] <Rahsed> I guess Metal Age is something else than our Iron Age?
[2:58:30] <+DakotaMacDoodle> not our metal age
[2:58:37] <silenthillbookofmammaries> skull ruins
[2:58:59] <+lordericter> Doom Hoonter
[2:59:03] <khotgor> The Metal Age was when heavy metal was born into the world
[2:59:08] <Rahsed> LUL
[2:59:15] <samuelfisk> The cultists built a temple over Jesus’s painbin
[2:59:24] <khotgor> HM Bands were pop-culture millions of years ago
[2:59:43] <Fenlig> Look Up
[2:59:45] <+fizzguy47> a bit more
[2:59:53] <CrimsonAle> look up in the hallway
[2:59:56] <silenthillbookofmammaries> try and break that adamantine glass
[3:00:06] <solid_stro> Green button on the ceiling above the steps
[3:00:23] <+fizzguy47> 180
[3:00:35] <CygnusRoboticus> I came from Pat
[3:00:48] <silenthillbookofmammaries> get that pat figurine
[3:00:58] <RiverBirch> Youre not pat, I'm pat.
[3:01:02] <Basteksamplastek> how is the game so far ?
[3:01:29] <solid_stro> @silenthillbookofmammaries Pat would be an Imp
[3:01:32] <silenthillbookofmammaries> uh oh its that borg queen
[3:01:42] <Rahsed> This guy's finest work SUCKS
[3:01:50] <+Javaa01> Hey, it was frozen in a slab of ice for like a couple thousand years, give him a break
[3:01:53] <Fenlig> Hes super Quake
[3:01:57] <Rahsed> Hey, it worked for Robocop Kappa
[3:02:13] <+Javaa01> Don't bother dealing with the shield, spam rockets at the sled
[3:02:14] <cap_bon> Oh a necron destroyer
[3:02:15] <silenthillbookofmammaries> fight this frosty water buffalo
[3:02:16] <$doomp12> bitch ain't even got legs
[3:02:23] <khotgor> Necron Destroyer, yey
[3:02:24] <Rahsed> Ain't even got legs
[3:02:30] <silenthillbookofmammaries> aint even got that crystal shit
[3:03:02] <silenthillbookofmammaries> aint even got these extra lives that make me doubly immortal
[3:03:44] <+Javaa01> They're one of the three main miniboss enemies in the game
[3:04:27] <silenthillbookofmammaries> health pack right
[3:06:00] <Rahsed> Finest creation btw
[3:06:09] <silenthillbookofmammaries> you gave em the business
[3:06:23] <+Javaa01> Okay now multitask
[3:06:31] <solid_stro> Boy it would really suck if you had to fight two of them
[3:06:39] <chowdah101> skyBruh
[3:07:06] <tigerd23> NotLikeThis
[3:07:36] <theaudacityofthisb> looks like we've reached the end of the line boys
[3:08:10] <CygnusRoboticus> this boss enemy seems almost like a necron ememy
[3:08:16] <cap_bon> doesnt feel like much of a weakpoint if it makes them faster and stronger
[3:08:23] <CygnusRoboticus> the idea of "we're so strong and smart" seems to overpower the actual enemy's competency
[3:08:35] <bordingcrazy> Bonk bonk
[3:09:19] <Rahsed> Doom Guy skipped arm day apparently
[3:09:29] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Yeah, the punch is wet paper, they want you to use the blood punch
[3:10:08] <+Javaa01> Honestly, if you just want a quick top up, burn them and instantly go for a chainsaw, a point of armor is just as valuable as a point of health
[3:11:31] <Rahsed> Truly a marvel of demonic engineering
[3:11:46] <solid_stro> You done son
[3:11:46] <Rahsed> Also Doom Guy does not negotiate
[3:11:54] <silenthillbookofmammaries> PLAGUE: try the flamethrower to regen health instead of glory kills
[3:12:23] <jellssssss20> Doesn't flamethrower give your armor not health?
[3:12:27] <Rahsed> He needed that first guy's head to get into their dumb meeting
[3:12:39] <cap_bon> his looks like a grineer
[3:12:45] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Yes, but they're basically interchangeable
[3:13:14] <khotgor> Fortress of DOOOOOOOOOOOOM
[3:13:22] <silenthillbookofmammaries> with the glory kills you have to be a lot more careful about not killing dudes
[3:13:33] <jellssssss20> Lotus?
[3:13:47] <arkv01> theres something very unfuckable about her
[3:13:48] <+Javaa01> It's just God
[3:13:56] <+Javaa01> Don't overthink this stuff
[3:14:05] <jellssssss20> Thanks for the heads up
[3:14:10] <Rahsed> Well, Europe is screwed
[3:14:18] <silenthillbookofmammaries> the angels and demons in this game are basically allied
[3:14:21] <+Javaa01> As well as in the game
[3:14:23] <LunarRemix> Meanwhile Australia is still fine.
[3:14:24] <cardboardboots> in the super gore nest
[3:14:26] <silenthillbookofmammaries> and are trying to fuck over Earth
[3:14:39] <arkv01> and you're right
[3:14:42] <RiverBirch> Its alot more Arcady?
[3:14:45] <arkv01> this one is trying to be too many things
[3:14:47] <Rahsed> Well now they're trying to build the DOOM UNIVERSE
[3:14:47] <cap_bon> the initial invasion was in Bosnia ?
[3:14:48] <+arancet> this one is quake
[3:14:50] <chowdah101> Wheres sam hayden at?
[3:14:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it seems very sequel-y
[3:14:53] <silenthillbookofmammaries> you have to read a lot of the lore to understand story context
[3:14:57] <BillieNoMates> They are trying to add a story to doom outside A MAN IS ANGRY
[3:15:00] <khotgor> Incorrect. Alien Demons AND Angels
[3:15:09] <transporterthesequel> Holy crap @PlagueOfGripes You're matching up with the Waypoint crew then
[3:15:10] <solid_stro> Hell isn’t the afterlife, it’s just another alternate dimension in these games.
[3:15:12] <khotgor> How special and mysterious
[3:15:23] <+SpiceMustF1ow> oh you mean the gameplay? The most important part?
[3:15:33] <arkv01> the alien segue is too much, just show us cool demon lords n shit
[3:15:38] <+Punishedkaiger> It's basically the gauss
[3:15:41] <+Javaa01> It's basically the same thing but with different upgrades
[3:15:42] <Rahsed> Well this is pretty much DOOM Gauss
[3:15:44] <+TreeeFOX> you know what the game should be about? it should be about killing shit. the whole god thing is fucking dumb.
[3:15:52] <khotgor> ^
[3:16:04] <silenthillbookofmammaries> they put 80% of the story in the lore documents, I think they were going for a Souls-y strategy
[3:16:11] <BillieNoMates> Every Doom game has that, Plague
[3:16:12] <arkv01> the god thing isn't terriblee but they're just aliens
[3:16:14] <BillieNoMates> OUtside 3
[3:16:15] <+Punishedkaiger> Can you do anything with the Sentinel batteries Plague?
[3:16:20] <Rahsed> Ammo is just a crutch
[3:16:21] <arkv01> if it was just satan it'd be fine
[3:16:22] <faykeyfake> u mad bro?
[3:16:41] <cap_bon> The game wants to have regenerating health but also not, so it constantly wants you to regain hp armour with recharging subsystems
[3:16:42] <+TreeeFOX> YES
[3:16:45] <Futurecity10> this game is meant to emulation Doom 2
[3:16:54] <Futurecity10> Which is meh
[3:16:57] <silenthillbookofmammaries> stop them before they do the monster mash
[3:17:06] <BillieNoMates> Doom 2016 did it better. The story was completely pointless and did nothing but give you negligible objectives
[3:17:06] <Rahsed> Contrary to what game is trying to say, demons are NOT people
[3:17:17] <khotgor> Trying to be Doom 2 whilst shoving 2016 customization in it
[3:17:21] <+TreeeFOX> 9.5/10 from all the outlets tho
[3:17:38] <+Javaa01> Bowser's Castle has in fact invaded earth
[3:17:45] <silenthillbookofmammaries> It's trying to say they're people??!
[3:18:06] <BillieNoMates> MP stuff
[3:18:06] <+Javaa01> It's for the main menu, and multiplayer
[3:18:10] <jellssssss20> Multiplayer
[3:18:13] <silenthillbookofmammaries> these are like overwatch emotes basically
[3:18:58] <Rahsed> Angry dooting
[3:19:01] <BillieNoMates> You'd be angry with no skin too
[3:19:07] <silenthillbookofmammaries> fight with trumpet Nito
[3:19:09] <+Javaa01> And multiplayer
[3:19:21] <BillieNoMates> Revenant in MP is the doot revenant
[3:19:28] <khotgor> I am disappointed with the Doot Revenant. All of his noises should be clown honking noises
[3:19:28] <silenthillbookofmammaries> night plague
[3:19:31] <%JJCheeker> Thank you Eli for the stream
[3:19:39] <+lordericter> it was neat
[3:19:41] <AncelDeLambert> I think they tried to hard to make it a crayon drawing
[3:19:43] <Basteksamplastek> do you like the game thou?
[3:19:57] <Fenlig> Well you pretty much always have a chainsaw ready
[3:20:03] <AncelDeLambert> they overdid making the game goofy and it didn't need to be goofy
[3:20:07] <%JJCheeker> Everybody have a good night bitterSweet
[3:20:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> story seems a bit sequel-y otherwise it looks more or less fun, and yeah ammo probably
[3:20:12] <silenthillbookofmammaries> they're trying to breath of the wild it to encourage weapon variety
[3:20:37] <silenthillbookofmammaries> Untitled Doot Game
[3:20:52] <+lordericter> ahh neat bitterbits
[3:20:55] <%JJCheeker> Goodnight you
[3:20:55] <silenthillbookofmammaries> nighty plague
