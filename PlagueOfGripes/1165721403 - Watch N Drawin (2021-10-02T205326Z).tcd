[0:16:56] <%KellBeII> open your tummy and do a gutty pull
[0:17:04] <TwoStarPlayersNik> It rhymes with FloodPorn

[0:17:37] <deadstrat> ok
[0:17:45] <Dunmarkh> @deadstrat soon.
[0:17:51] <deadstrat> nooo
[0:18:05] <+MindWebby> one day
[0:18:22] <capnbluebeard1> HeyGuys
[0:18:35] <%Bigchill___> plague time
[0:18:39] <ThisGuyx85> the purple kitty looks grumpy
[0:19:03] <+nishi_xia> sleepy cat plague
[0:19:11] <deadstrat> it all makes chronological sense now
[0:19:29] <00kama00> ooooo first time catching your stream plague
[0:19:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Hey Plague, I recently lost motivation for content creation because of stuff in my private life that really brought me down. Do you have any tips for how to find your way back to wanting to create stuff after you haven't done it for a while?
[0:20:02] <Dunmarkh> rain?
[0:20:12] <%Samex_Comex> Damn it's really coming down
[0:20:36] <heytakeiteasyterry> damn dude alot of rain water
[0:20:40] <Presence_Eternal> I like rain+fire+coffee shop. Which is rather odd since I don't like actually being in coffee shops.
[0:20:46] <deadstrat> You should know by now
[0:21:16] <+RogueEwok> it's very loud
[0:21:20] <deadstrat> very loud,but i am wearing headphones
[0:21:33] <Presence_Eternal> Doesn't seem that loud to me. Maybe I have problems hearing rain correctly.
[0:21:38] <elaboratebagel> Sounds fine
[0:21:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I don't think it's all that lound
[0:21:48] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I'm also wearing headphones, but I thought it was fine
[0:21:52] <deadstrat> its gone
[0:21:53] <bigb00gi3> I'd say it was louder than the music, but it's totally gone now ye
[0:22:06] <elaboratebagel> Sounded fine before you muted it
[0:22:17] <Presence_Eternal> I cannot hear it.
[0:22:19] <JovianGargoyle> nope
[0:22:20] <%Badpest> nope
[0:22:21] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I cannot hear it
[0:22:21] <+theenigmaticdude> no
[0:22:38] <JovianGargoyle> there it is
[0:22:40] <bigb00gi3> very very faintly now
[0:22:40] <+Metballs> Verfy low
[0:22:42] <+theenigmaticdude> yes
[0:22:51] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I still can't hear it
[0:23:16] <bigb00gi3> ah, that's right on the money I think
[0:23:24] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Now it's audible.
[0:23:29] <deadstrat> its good for atmosphere
[0:23:40] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Yeah this is fine for me
[0:23:56] <Presence_Eternal> I hope everyone has been getting enough real rain.
[0:24:15] <Coystick> Instantly hit with vibe
[0:24:18] <deadstrat> What happened?
[0:24:21] <bigb00gi3> nyannComfy
[0:24:29] <Streamers_Psychosis> a hooontah must hoont
[0:24:31] <JovianGargoyle> Lady Maria, I hear it. Plip plop
[0:24:36] <%Bigchill___> I think its very sweet, Eli.
[0:25:21] <Coystick> From's concept art is beautiful to look at, but can be really messy. Probably a nightmare to model off.
[0:25:23] <Redne22> hello i heard we were drawing bloodborne
[0:25:31] <+KiwiRedgrave> buttborne? Pog
[0:25:35] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I like the one without the coat better
[0:25:42] <bigb00gi3> if they're not the same, they're extremely close
[0:26:08] <deadstrat> the pants are dif
[0:26:16] <Coystick> they're both called "Hunter Garb" in game, they're the same model except for the cape
[0:26:30] <deadstrat> oooh
[0:26:55] <Skatedeandre> What’s stopping men from looking like this
[0:27:05] <bigb00gi3> comfort and common sense
[0:27:06] <Skatedeandre> And women too
[0:27:12] <JovianGargoyle> I was always partial to the charred hunter set myself.
[0:27:33] <TwoStarPlayersNik> The vest with the excessive amount of buckles is one thing, but men still wear swank overcoats
[0:27:43] <%Bigchill___> I'm guessing this is Gura?
[0:27:51] <Coystick> My go to was the Yharnam Hunter set
[0:27:55] <%Heart0fInk> No moobies today?
[0:27:56] <%Bigchill___> or just a blood borne draw?
[0:28:29] <%Samex_Comex> Some day the camera can capture food so we can see that cat model have food throw in it's mouth
[0:28:32] <+MindWebby> It's Nanners I believe
[0:28:34] <bigb00gi3> squinting at the layers on the side, this might be a vei and nyan duo nyannComfy
[0:28:57] <+MindWebby> Nyanners
[0:29:26] <%ralphwiggum16> Plague, how come you never draw goblins?
[0:30:10] <%Heart0fInk> @ralphwiggum16 the fuck you talkin about? He's drawn Yordles. (or however you spell it)
[0:30:11] <bigb00gi3> man, sometimes they really do pull some dirty tricks for dmca claims
[0:30:15] <%ralphwiggum16> It's always a journey of discovery and adventure with you, Plague!
[0:30:24] <%Samex_Comex> It's me I own the sound of rain I also own the sound of leaf crunches
[0:30:40] <deadstrat> Yordles are not goblins
[0:31:06] <deadstrat> !!
[0:31:17] <%Heart0fInk> @deadstrat Prove it
[0:31:34] <%Samex_Comex> Goblin light?
[0:31:41] <Dunmarkh> the rain has stopped, the sun has come
[0:31:43] <deadstrat> They are not green Q:E:D
[0:31:57] <pixelpaggos> wholesome art? am I watching the right plauge?
[0:32:22] <Presence_Eternal> It's probably based on the Wesley Willis song.
[0:32:27] <%Bigchill___> Does RansomGram count as a goblin?
[0:32:29] <Dunmarkh> it's fine
[0:32:31] <Redne22> i hope this movie is so bad its good
[0:32:32] <Coystick> This is one of them tax ride off movies I bet
[0:32:59] <%Heart0fInk> Nah. it sounds about perfect
[0:33:12] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I woke up this morning and thought "I'd really like to watch a Frank Strayer movie today"
[0:33:42] <%Samex_Comex> I hope it has a screaming skull
[0:33:58] <Coystick> What was that Venus planet of the women one last time? With the muppet dinosaur god and Johnny Robot? 10/10
[0:34:01] <deadstrat> How do you find these ?
[0:34:03] <Jetsfantasy> I'm already learning stuff from watching you work
[0:34:11] <Redne22> hey plague did you ever do lady Maria?
[0:34:13] <TwoStarPlayersNik> No lie, you can still watch a Buster Keaton movie from the 1920's today and it's legitimately funny
[0:34:25] <deadstrat> It means Mayor in german
[0:34:33] <%Samex_Comex> He hates toys
[0:34:40] <Down10_> Hi Plague & chat
[0:34:53] <%Heart0fInk> oh god..
[0:35:02] <Redne22> hello
[0:35:05] <%Heart0fInk> i didn't even think about that
[0:35:09] <deadstrat> THE BATS
[0:35:43] <Coystick> HP Lovecraft was alive when this was made.
[0:35:51] <%Heart0fInk> An outbreak of the common vampirism

[0:36:31] <deadstrat> all bats are evil and not cute
[0:36:46] <electro_cola> dunkpires
[0:36:57] <%Heart0fInk> No. i've seen a bunch of bats tho. had one in our house once too.
[0:37:06] <Redne22> this is a great movie
[0:37:17] <Dunmarkh> Have only seen a few bats around here, they usually go after mosquitos, guess they get the blood by proxy
[0:37:18] <Presence_Eternal> Only if they have enough dots in the Protean discipline.
[0:37:23] <%Samex_Comex> Some times there would be a bat napping outside all the wall at Walmart I was a cartman at
[0:37:27] <deadstrat> I hate bats

[0:41:35] <%fithfire> Plagues avatar looks as tired as he sounds XD
[0:41:39] <electro_cola> she fears nothing, except fear itself
[0:42:00] <Daxalog> Plague do you ever have an issue with getting Text to work in Paint Tool Sai? Or do you just handraw the letters yourself?
[0:42:13] <Redne22> the sound is so bad you can heard the crackle

[1:16:46] <DatGreyMind> Dog-faced Hermans

[1:19:21] <%Samex_Comex> Oh god they did do more to Herman's corpse
[1:19:32] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Kind of a dick move to stake Herman through the heart off-screen
[1:19:41] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I wanted to see that damnit
[1:19:45] <DatGreyMind> What a cop out
[1:19:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> "Bury me with my gussy"
[1:20:03] <+dakarplaugas> They just commit murder and naw its all good
[1:20:08] <Redne22> poor herman
[1:20:14] <DatGreyMind> Well he might have been a vampire. Justified!
[1:20:26] <%Samex_Comex> Now who will take care of the bats
[1:20:32] <Dunmarkh> Everyone needs human blood
[1:20:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I mean they need blood in order to withdraw blood
[1:20:52] <Presence_Eternal> Black sausage.
[1:21:02] <DatGreyMind> Nobody could possibly be so thirsty
[1:21:20] <Redne22> no use for blood
[1:21:27] <DatGreyMind> Morosely smokes pipe
[1:21:44] <DatGreyMind> No, not the POISON sleeping tablets!
[1:21:46] <TwoStarPlayersNik> did that bottle say "Poison sleeping pills"?
[1:21:48] <deadstrat> I like how the protagonist is completely clueless all the movie through
[1:21:50] <%Samex_Comex> Mmm poison
[1:22:11] <+KiwiRedgrave> its gonna say poison on the tablet before he takes it i bet
[1:22:19] <DatGreyMind> That would really be fantastic
[1:22:26] <Redne22> do drugs
[1:22:40] <Presence_Eternal> ...sodium cyanide? Wait a dang minute here!
[1:22:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I think we have a vampire gussy on our hands

[1:23:29] <Redne22> hes gonna accidentally solve this
[1:23:47] <+KiwiRedgrave> to beyd

[1:28:03] <deadstrat> what is THAT
[1:28:10] <DatGreyMind> Uh... proto-vampire?
[1:28:27] <Presence_Eternal> Later on the vampire would attempt to redeem himself through police detective work.
[1:28:29] <DatGreyMind> I love this dude's expressions
[1:28:31] <%Murphio_GS> that face lmao
[1:28:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> we have created pure, lab-distilled gussy, a type of gussy never before seen by man

[1:29:05] <deadstrat> Oh really
[1:29:09] <DatGreyMind> Outplayed!
[1:29:12] <Schuhart> He didn't eat the P̶o̶i̶s̶o̶n̶ Sleeping Tablets?!

[1:29:53] <Redne22> haha
[1:30:24] <TwoStarPlayersNik> is this... the big climax of the movie?
[1:30:32] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:30:45] <Schuhart> That Pocket Hammerless doing some work
[1:30:49] <Presence_Eternal> Man, turns out you could kill vampires with guns all along.
[1:30:54] <Redne22> solved it!
[1:31:02] <DatGreyMind> Just a shadowy guy
[1:31:06] <Redne22> jobs done
[1:31:10] <deadstrat> A meat bun
[1:31:11] <%Heart0fInk> no
[1:31:15] <TwoStarPlayersNik> humanity was the true monster all along
[1:31:25] <Redne22> it wasnt a monster
[1:31:32] <DatGreyMind> There really was no vampire
[1:31:32] <deadstrat> Come on
[1:31:36] <%Samex_Comex> Damn that gussy be moving
[1:31:41] <stevenellis386> booo
[1:31:44] <%Down10_> It was the doctor, not a bat
[1:31:47] <deadstrat> What an ending
[1:31:49] <Schuhart> At least the gussy made it through
[1:31:54] <%Samex_Comex> Poor Herman
[1:31:55] <stevenellis386> herman died in vain
[1:31:58] <Redne22> it was good
[1:32:00] <DatGreyMind> Herman suffered for nothing
[1:32:04] <+Shaggnar> Yeah
[1:32:05] <RKO_MamaDank> Something about people are the real monster.
[1:32:06] <%Down10_> It was another time
[1:32:15] <Presence_Eternal> The soap flakes creature.
[1:32:18] <%Samex_Comex> This better have a snow creature
[1:32:21] <deadstrat> Once again I implore everyone to never say gussy again
[1:32:22] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Unforgivable that Herman got staked through the heart off-screen
[1:32:26] <+Shaggnar> Didn't we already do that one?
[1:32:56] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Horror movie rules say that if a character is killed off-screen, they didn't really die. This movie got it all wrong
[1:32:56] <%Samex_Comex> Is this the one where they dunk the witch
[1:33:07] <%Murphio_GS> No that's She witch
[1:33:11] <%Down10_> Plague, can I ask where your accent is from?
[1:33:13] <%Murphio_GS> She beast
[1:33:29] <%Samex_Comex> Right that was Shebeast
[1:33:59] <+Shaggnar> KY is one of those northern most southern states like MD and WV
[1:34:04] <%Samex_Comex> The screaming homeless woman they kept knocking out

[1:47:49] <Dunmarkh> @TwoStarPlayersNik it's probably in a mountain range
[1:47:55] <stevenellis386> they must be driving 15 mph
[1:48:28] <+CalderGaming> "tell me dear, what do you think about letting children play with gasoline"

[1:50:09] <+SkookumHime> Good Evening Plague!
[1:50:09] <HR_Freud> The true horror experience
[1:50:09] <TwoStarPlayersNik> He's so cool

[1:51:22] <Schuhart> The gussy too stong. Mario has to stay
[1:51:26] <Presence_Eternal> When the walking std is more tasteful than the music.
[1:51:33] <TwoStarPlayersNik> "Bullshit."  starts blasting screaming opera
[1:51:34] <+SkookumHime> This music is gonna give me a migraine
[1:51:43] <Coystick> This feels like a musical choice A24 Pictures would put in some shit.
[1:51:50] <elaboratebagel> Is this the unedited doom eternal soundtrack
[1:51:52] <Chaos_Aether> shes a witch
[1:51:55] <+CalderGaming> Actual Gaslighting

[1:52:10] <+InhumanMilitia> it was the spin meme in chorus
[1:52:10] <Chaos_Aether> burn at the stakes
[1:52:53] <%vizardrob> what shitty movie is this?
[1:53:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> you can't run, the music is inside you
[1:53:12] <stevenellis386> turnupthevolume SingsNote
[1:53:17] <Schuhart> Horrible noise music is the main character of the movie.
[1:54:03] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Another Torgo
[1:54:10] <%Murphio_GS> It's Igor
[1:54:13] <Ziegsy> Do you think he shaves his pubes like his mustache?
[1:54:14] <thelazy_god> why do they have so many quiet spots in older films that are not for atmosphere.. it's just dead quiet spots..
[1:54:16] <Tahzani> "Froderick"
[1:54:24] <+CalderGaming> @vizardrob The Witches Mountain (1972). No, there is no apostrophe in the title

[1:54:34] <HR_Freud> Every new character is hotter than the last
[1:54:43] <%vizardrob> @CalderGaming cheers
[1:54:56] <+CalderGaming> @Ziegsy no one shaved down there in the 70s
[1:55:19] <%Samex_Comex> I hope Igor lives
[1:55:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I want a cut of this movie where they replace the screaming music with Rollin' by Limp Bizkit
[1:56:16] <%Bigchill___> My favorite joke like that is the one where its a guy selling a car and the customer points at the car and says "cargo space?" and the salesman says "no, car no go space, car go road."
[1:56:19] <NireFuster> Is this movie like not copyrighted or something so that you can watch it and show it on stream like this or..?

[2:04:49] <Futurecity10> MAAAAAARIOOOOOOOOOO
[2:05:04] <RickyRelucent> oh god it really is him
[2:05:24] <+Mrbaconator> this guy could play wario
[2:05:24] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Cheer1
[2:05:26] <Redne22> yes
[2:05:30] <elaboratebagel> And igor, voiced by jack black
[2:05:32] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This will be the plot of the Mario movie, Mario wants to get away from his bitch wife so he starts creeping on Bowsette on a beach somewhere
[2:05:40] <%Samex_Comex> Mario looks like this old man I used to clean a bank with
[2:05:48] <%Murphio_GS> oh god
[2:05:48] <%Bigchill___> It feels like it
[2:05:57] <+CalderGaming> well i WASN'T worried about that, but NOW,
[2:05:58] <%sandrews> I didn't even think of that and now I have a fear
[2:05:59] <rosemon5001> you know it will be that 99%
[2:05:59] <+Mrbaconator> he's absolutely not gonna be doing an accent regardless of anything
[2:05:59] <+Dakuu75> I wasn't, until now
[2:06:02] <Dunmarkh> And then fucking peach in mario's body like omikron
[2:06:05] <+Mrbaconator> it's just gonna be chris pratt talking
[2:06:10] <+Mrbaconator> in marios body
[2:06:11] <%lemoan> everything about that movie worries me
[2:06:13] <Redne22> course it is
[2:06:18] <%sparklinghallow> now that's a fear I have, thanks
[2:06:19] <zaibatsu_member_333> I'll be to watching for Lugi's performance
[2:06:22] <SilverRoddo> I want it to be “Real Steel” but Mario
[2:06:23] <Shwepie> It'll be a sequel to the 1993 movie.
[2:06:31] <+emperordread> oh neat, is  that Vei and Nyan?
[2:06:33] <Krasis404> Man,I have a feeling it's gonna be like those Jumanji remakes, but with Mario
[2:06:34] <+MightyDuckShoes> So just JUMANJI 3?
[2:06:35] <+Mrbaconator> it doesn't matter what the plot is it will just be chris taliking
[2:06:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:06:58] <%Samex_Comex> Where's the witch
[2:07:16] <+Mrbaconator> where is the mountain
[2:07:20] <SilverRoddo> It blows my mind that the guy wrote Real Steel also did When Dreams May Come.
[2:07:27] <%Murphio_GS> There's two mountains
[2:07:31] <%Bigchill___> Everyone asks where is the witch, but no one asks, how is the witch.
[2:07:46] <+Mrbaconator> who is the witch, why is the witch
[2:07:47] <TwoStarPlayersNik> hahaha
[2:07:50] <%Samex_Comex> Is Igor the mountain witch
[2:07:51] <%sandrews> oh is that nyanners?
[2:07:55] <SilverRoddo> Is it cold on the V V itch’s Mountain?
[2:07:59] <%Bigchill___> THERE IS NO NEED TO SHOUT!
[2:08:01] <RickyRelucent> movies are like that, lots of rank and file movies few disasters
[2:08:04] <%Heart0fInk> whatd i miss?
[2:08:05] <Coystick> LUNCH. NOW. FUCKO,
[2:08:06] <RickyRelucent> random smash hits out of nowhere
[2:08:13] <Dunmarkh> chameleon man should learn how to read lips
[2:08:16] <Cozy90> they both look like they have glass eyes
[2:08:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> He's no Torgo
[2:08:26] <+Mrbaconator> it's a mountain of madness
[2:08:26] <%Bigchill___> Take care AND be awful careful?
[2:08:40] <%lemoan> why is he dubbed over??
[2:08:41] <RickyRelucent> often under the same director
[2:08:56] <%Murphio_GS> Igor doesn't serve steak
[2:09:05] <%Murphio_GS> Igor serves goat
[2:09:06] <%Bigchill___> I'm just now noticing the utter lack of background noise or music
[2:09:15] <%Heart0fInk> sex appeal
[2:09:15] <RickyRelucent> and depending who you ask a certain director might be a godsend or a cretin
[2:09:15] <+BlackStarAura> Mmm steak
[2:09:31] <%Bigchill___> goatsss
[2:09:31] <%Samex_Comex> Goats!
[2:09:35] <+Mrbaconator> the goats are witches
[2:09:37] <Redne22> good times
[2:09:41] <CubicPhantom> oh you know why they zoomed on the goats
[2:09:45] <%Heart0fInk> sex appeal
[2:09:46] <Julkson> It's an establishing shot. The goats will be important
[2:09:48] <SilverRoddo> 🐐
[2:09:57] <%sandrews> Looks Italian or Spain Spanish
[2:09:58] <+BinaryFireball> geo guesser is fun
[2:10:01] <%Bigchill___> Are yo ugood at it?
[2:10:04] <Dunmarkh> that could be cool
[2:10:05] <+Mrbaconator> geo is good
[2:10:13] <%Heart0fInk> idk what that is
[2:10:24] <+Mrbaconator> geo is good till you get some place in russia then you have to yolo cuz you aren't gonna get it right
[2:10:26] <%Murphio_GS> Geography quizzes are also cool
[2:10:27] <SilverRoddo> Neo Geo Kappa
[2:10:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Was he looking at that person through binoculars like 10 feet away?
[2:10:36] <CubicPhantom> sounds entertaining then
[2:10:40] <%Bigchill___> Probably better than me
[2:10:44] <Dunmarkh> @Heart0fInk you basically get dropped into a spot on google streetview and have to figure out where you are
[2:10:46] <Jetsfantasy> @Heart0fInk You're dropped into a random spot on Google Maps and have to guess where you are by 'walking' around
[2:11:01] <%vizardrob> sounds fun
[2:11:02] <%Samex_Comex> That's sounds cool
[2:11:05] <+Mrbaconator> @PlagueOfGripes ok but also do it with paige i feel like that's golden content
[2:11:09] <theultrabunnydog> nyanners <3
[2:11:12] <%MelBrooksKA> That sounds impossible
[2:11:25] <Presence_Eternal> Language on sign + side of road cars are on will get you some of the way there.
[2:11:26] <+Mrbaconator> wait his NAME IS MARIO
[2:11:30] <Cozy90> did they leave the keys in the car???

[2:12:24] <RickyRelucent> well i prolly do but i couldn't name em, no frame of reference
[2:12:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> Then again i've been working on it
[2:12:31] <Schuhart> Goat stole the car
[2:12:32] <%cooldude69xx> Does Mario not feel like a real name anymore to anyone else?
[2:12:42] <+Mrbaconator> do you have asshole shephard neighbors
[2:12:51] <SilverRoddo> This film was produced in a time where you can just leave your keys in the ignition.
[2:12:58] <%Heart0fInk> His Name Is mario!? hahaha Where's Zelda then!?
[2:13:12] <%Heart0fInk> god i'm so clever
[2:13:19] <+Mrbaconator> clearly she's the legend of zelda
[2:13:25] <+BinaryFireball> nipplestache johnson
[2:13:28] <%Samex_Comex> She's Luigi
[2:13:32] <+BinaryFireball> thats what they call me
[2:13:35] <%Murphio_GS> Mrs. Legend of Zelda
[2:13:36] <RickyRelucent> such a moustache has to be a nightmare to do anything with
[2:13:39] <RickyRelucent> kiss, drink, eat
[2:13:42] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I'm only here for the gussy. I need it. It's like a hunger. A thirst.
[2:13:50] <+Mrbaconator> someone left their alien noises mix tape in the car
[2:13:53] <RickyRelucent> smokers have it worst that way
[2:14:08] <RickyRelucent> *fffftttt*
[2:14:09] <%MelBrooksKA> Damn car stealing goats!
[2:14:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Im trying to get some kids to understand the importantance of thumbnailing but they ether put TOO much effort or time into it or not enough. Do you have any idea how I can make them reach a middle ground?
[2:14:31] <RickyRelucent> oh its actually not that bad
[2:14:34] <Presence_Eternal> Better check under the hood for a toad bomb.
[2:14:42] <+SveriSageAdvice> and they leave the keys AGAIN
[2:14:42] <SilverRoddo> Alright, i would probably accept a moustache ride from him.  I guess, idk, maybe
[2:14:46] <ThisGuyx85> Hey is that skull to play pranks with?
[2:15:00] <Coystick> Love the dude's jacket
[2:15:11] <RickyRelucent> moustache ride?
[2:15:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> I guess
[2:15:18] <+Mrbaconator> @doc_ock_rokc are you perchance asking how you could reach these keeds
[2:15:19] <%MelBrooksKA> What's thumbnailing?
[2:15:36] <+BinaryFireball> ^^
[2:15:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> Yeah Im a fletchling professor
[2:15:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thumbnailing is the "art" of making a quick compozition
[2:15:58] <SilverRoddo> Don’t google it
[2:16:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> comp
[2:16:05] <RickyRelucent> fully fledged professor? nice
[2:16:06] <+Mrbaconator> this woman is definitely not a witch
[2:16:19] <+Mrbaconator> plot twist mario was the witch all along
[2:16:19] <+doc_ock_rokc> Not fully im in trial
[2:16:25] <%vizardrob> it smells like sulfur
[2:16:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> teaching kids animation and concept art
[2:16:36] <%Murphio_GS> What a nice babushka
[2:17:07] <RickyRelucent> the yellow pant suit is a weird pick
[2:17:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> THAT is a thumbnail
[2:17:14] <RickyRelucent> it stands out so blatantly
[2:17:21] <+doc_ock_rokc> basically
[2:17:35] <RickyRelucent> >soup
[2:17:44] <RickyRelucent> i'd consider it a stew
[2:17:57] <Presence_Eternal> Witch's Brüe
[2:17:57] <SilverRoddo> She’s like a totally-spy.
[2:18:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> Basically thumbnails are SUPER ROUGHS your supposed to churn out real quickly so you can put down ideas
[2:18:14] <Dunmarkh> A man if culture
[2:18:24] <Dunmarkh> of culture, fuck
[2:18:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thing is when I get them to move quickly htye draw like third grade school children
[2:19:09] <+BinaryFireball> so do you usually thumbnail as the first thing? and then do rough sketch, then inking after?
[2:19:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> YES
[2:19:16] <ThisGuyx85> that's the only thing you need to take pictures of to be called a photographer
[2:19:38] <+doc_ock_rokc> Thumbnails are in physical medums around the size of your thumbnails
[2:19:39] <CubicPhantom> they just decided out of the blue to stay in a village that has literally only 1 resident
[2:19:52] <Schuhart> MOEAGARE MOEAGARE
[2:19:55] <Presence_Eternal> My favorite part is when it stops.
[2:19:58] <+CalderGaming> this singing is still better than the other bits
[2:20:05] <%vizardrob> 2 spoopy
[2:20:06] <%Bigchill___> its adds to the HORROR~
[2:20:09] <RickyRelucent> i guess because the visuals are meh they uhh
[2:20:11] <RickyRelucent> tried some stuff
[2:20:13] <RickyRelucent> music wise
[2:20:13] <%Murphio_GS> yeah the instrumental isn't great
[2:20:19] <RickyRelucent> think it goes for alot of older movies
[2:20:31] <ThisGuyx85> that was werid
[2:20:31] <+doc_ock_rokc> basically its about making refrence for your artwork
[2:20:37] <RickyRelucent> montage teim
[2:20:40] <+realm_forge> Still better than the kingdom hearts pat
[2:20:43] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[2:20:53] <+SveriSageAdvice> odd choice to even have music at all like this in a horror movie
[2:20:54] <+Mrbaconator> hey igor tried his best
[2:20:58] <SilverRoddo> One can make a sweet remix album from this.
[2:21:05] <RickyRelucent> inb4 it was the sound mixer who did it
[2:21:12] <+BlackStarAura> The hell is that noise
[2:21:17] <$livlinn> EEEEHHH EEEEHH EEEEEEHHEEEEHHEEEH shiaSing
[2:21:18] <Glasphemy> with the sleepy eyes you look liek you're having an exorcism
[2:21:23] <sauceboss310> sugoiYu sugoiRi
[2:21:33] <Coystick> This is what IBS sounds like
[2:21:34] <+Mrbaconator> is this what every guy on the street in the 90s had when they were trying to push their mix tape
[2:21:34] <%Murphio_GS> It's expression of Igor's soul
[2:21:36] <Maids4lyfe> this was the original brain power
[2:21:38] <+realm_forge> ABBA’s new stuff sucks
[2:21:40] <SilverRoddo> bitterPasta
[2:21:41] <%Samex_Comex> Sick came back for some dank tunes
[2:21:44] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This is peak 70's Italian Eurovision
[2:21:47] <%Bigchill___> gotta feel the power in the lyrics
[2:21:54] <Presence_Eternal> Do you think this won a granny award?
[2:22:01] <Schuhart> Gussy award
[2:22:16] <Maids4lyfe> the song never ended we all went deaf instead
[2:22:21] <%Samex_Comex> Is she the witch
[2:22:39] <%sandrews> I think it was us that was the witch all along
[2:22:55] <%Murphio_GS> why would you say such a thing, babushka would never do witch things
[2:23:05] <%Samex_Comex> I guess we have to burn chat
[2:23:18] <ThisGuyx85> he was eaten by a were wolves at this point
[2:23:34] <CubicPhantom> I kind of hope there is another witch on the mountain - just a series of ever more obvious evil mountain women culminating in a super-witch
[2:23:48] <ThisGuyx85> no we can't look for him. he a goner
[2:24:00] <%vizardrob> i'm OLD
[2:24:04] <%Samex_Comex> He is more moustache then man
[2:24:24] <ThisGuyx85> just some witch mice don't worry
[2:24:26] <%sandrews> can it be a series of the witches that are just higher elevation than the last one
[2:24:35] <%sandrews> and then witch 10 is in space
[2:24:54] <%Murphio_GS> she'll become a witch
[2:25:16] <ThisGuyx85> wow she can fall asleep while sittling stright up
[2:25:18] <RickyRelucent> can't imagine them having complex camera tripods yet
[2:25:23] <RickyRelucent> to perk up inside cars etc
[2:25:40] <RickyRelucent> they prolly just lighted it with the one light in the car
[2:25:47] <MarylandJutsu> what if we the viewer was the witch this whole time?
[2:25:49] <Coystick> HERE IT COMES
[2:25:58] <+SveriSageAdvice> what plot
[2:25:59] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This is about as visible as that Winterfell fight scene in GoT season 8
[2:26:07] <+CalderGaming> oh shit, CATHOLICS
[2:26:10] <$SGrim> Sleepy music
[2:26:12] <Dunmarkh> Italy was a mistake
[2:26:15] <%Samex_Comex> But it's funny that you have to listen to it
[2:26:16] <RickyRelucent> and a little bit better plot wise

[2:26:38] <TwoStarPlayersNik> haaha
[2:26:43] <%sandrews> italy wasn't a mistake. Italy filmmaking was
[2:26:45] <+Mrbaconator> that was important plot development
[2:26:49] <LVL1_Scumbag> But if we skip through all the padding, the movie will be over!
[2:27:00] <TwoStarPlayersNik> every scene transition should be an abrupt scream
[2:27:12] <%sandrews> just hit the 2x speed
[2:27:29] <ThisGuyx85> that old ladies hair looks like the hair they used for the fake Santa in the Santa Clause 3

[2:38:18] <kingofnymphs> kitty plague's disappointed eyes are my favorite
[2:38:20] <+Mrbaconator> im telling ya, laser mission pops off
[2:38:23] <+SveriSageAdvice> this speaks of a filmmaker who sniffed his own farts lol
[2:38:37] <%Murphio_GS> Remember the Ape
[2:38:46] <%Samex_Comex> The movie did have booba and a bit of booty
[2:38:46] <RickyRelucent> who'd of thought we'd go from big handlebar moustaches and bushy ass lumberjack bears
[2:38:50] <Redne22> is this over yet?
[2:38:53] <Coystick> I dunno, it has an almost Blair Witchian atmosphere
[2:38:57] <%sandrews> I will say when the movie isnt dark I can at least tell what is happening in the screen
[2:38:58] <ThisGuyx85> that's it he's daed and she becomes a witch
[2:38:58] <RickyRelucent> to pedostaches and the bicycle helmet strip
[2:39:30] <+SveriSageAdvice> "im not sure why i was drawn to this person lurking in a dark doorway just staring at me"
[2:39:49] <%vizardrob> no lol
[2:39:52] <RickyRelucent> i'd have mad respect for some 16 year old with backhair for growing such a stache and just rocking it
[2:39:52] <+SveriSageAdvice> nah
[2:39:54] <Schuhart> Eh
[2:39:59] <+Mrbaconator> i mind 😠
[2:40:00] <%sandrews> she used her witchy ways
[2:40:07] <%sandrews> witchy woman
[2:40:08] <CubicPhantom> she was entranced into a cave by... is that awful music diegetic? was the doorway calling her soul?
[2:40:36] <kingofnymphs> Santa?
[2:40:41] <%Samex_Comex> The singing makes me want to shit my organs more then the screaming skull
[2:40:43] <Redne22> santa?
[2:40:43] <Schuhart> SANTA! I HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT MY GIFT!
[2:40:47] <Presence_Eternal> I demand better presents in my stocking this year!
[2:40:49] <+SveriSageAdvice> did he even try the doorknob?
[2:41:02] <%MelBrooksKA> Not my girl friend lady, I just saw a dude that yelled "Rawr" at me
[2:41:04] <%sandrews> lmao
[2:41:07] <+Mrbaconator> someone is shitting
[2:41:13] <RickyRelucent> good music they recorded as best they can
[2:41:14] <+sherdest> its so scary watching people would around with a ear piercing yolding woman in the background XD
[2:41:16] <%Samex_Comex> Kitty

[2:41:26] <+Mrbaconator> GOD someone edit in salems lines from the show
[2:41:30] <kingofnymphs> why do old movie cats sound so in pain
[2:41:31] <Cozy90> hey ur no sabrina

[2:41:49] <ThisGuyx85> that darn cat
[2:41:55] <+SteveSouth> watch out for that witch's wormhole
[2:41:57] <TwoStarPlayersNik> oh no the lady got turned into a cat
[2:42:19] <TwoStarPlayersNik> for some men this is considered an improvement
[2:42:20] <RickyRelucent> i'd actually vape instead of the shit wasn't so expensive
[2:42:32] <RickyRelucent> if it wasn't so expensive*
[2:42:42] <RickyRelucent> i used to make my own coils etc
[2:42:51] <RickyRelucent> never got one without the blow up chip tho
[2:43:16] <Presence_Eternal> The cat is scared the music will start back up.
[2:43:23] <%cooldude69xx> Bloodborne likes it's moons
[2:43:25] <%Bigchill___> @PlagueOfGripes you could have one of the little puppet guys down there holding up something
[2:43:27] <ThisGuyx85> Moon shine! the mother load
[2:43:43] <+Mrbaconator> the cat just has a faulty carborator
[2:43:43] <+ALazo> cat is making airplane noises
[2:43:45] <%sandrews> what did they do to this cat to make it sound like this
[2:43:47] <+CatastropheCorvid> Never owned a Siamese?
[2:43:50] <RickyRelucent> it might if its like 13 kg and u grab it by the scruff
[2:43:55] <LVL1_Scumbag> Get off me, woman!
[2:43:56] <%Down10_> wtf
[2:43:57] <+Mrbaconator> JUDO THROW
[2:44:01] <Coystick> Uuuuh
[2:44:03] <+CatastropheCorvid> Fuck my Siamese was a chatty little prick. I loved that cat.
[2:44:06] <%Samex_Comex> Yo the cat was a hot lady!
[2:44:07] <%sandrews> oh she was the cat
[2:44:08] <%Bigchill___> Judo is strong against the witch
[2:44:08] <+austing22> what is this swat cats
[2:44:08] <Schuhart> Cat woman
[2:44:16] <RickyRelucent> >heaving woman
[2:44:16] <%sandrews> wtf
[2:44:17] <%Down10_> huh?
[2:44:20] <CubicPhantom> i was hoping
[2:44:21] <RickyRelucent> >WERE SANTA DOE
[2:44:21] <Schuhart> She ate santa!?!
[2:44:22] <%Down10_> This is a weird movie
[2:44:22] <Cozy90> in my mouth?
[2:44:27] <%Heart0fInk> where is Santa?
[2:44:42] <$SGrim> The witches killed my truck!
[2:44:46] <+SveriSageAdvice> considering how old the movie is, i wouldn't be surprised if they for real tortured a cat to get the audio for the movie
[2:44:47] <Presence_Eternal> Oh no, the car has a bad plot device.
[2:45:05] <CubicPhantom> I'm surprised the movie even remembered he took that out earlier
[2:45:07] <ThisGuyx85> that what you get when you leave your radio on all night long
[2:45:10] <RickyRelucent> way to ruin old movies for me
[2:45:25] <RickyRelucent> i got 13 of the fuckers
[2:45:26] <KineticZen> I rather doubt it
[2:45:30] <TwoStarPlayersNik> and they all lived happily ever after. the end
[2:45:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Bye witch mountain
[2:45:40] <RickyRelucent> and a dog
[2:45:45] <Julkson> This movie can be described with the phrase "That was pointless"
[2:45:49] <kingofnymphs> The End
[2:45:59] <Schuhart> Santa was never found again
[2:46:01] <+SveriSageAdvice> wow this is for real the end? nothing really happened?
[2:46:04] <%sandrews> what a fun time.
[2:46:05] <RickyRelucent> but look where we filmed
[2:46:12] <Presence_Eternal> But what happened to the elves?
[2:46:16] <TwoStarPlayersNik> I barely even know why he's there in the first place
[2:46:17] <RickyRelucent> and it does look nice
[2:46:18] <+BinaryFireball> i dont get how movies run out of money
[2:46:21] <+BinaryFireball> you have funding
[2:46:31] <+BinaryFireball> like they cant budget?
[2:46:32] <RickyRelucent> guess ppl weren't sure how to write scripts yet
[2:46:43] <TwoStarPlayersNik> "Welcome to Silent Hill"
[2:46:43] <RickyRelucent> some ppl focus on the bigger picture
[2:46:45] <CubicPhantom> endings are hard, and money runs out
[2:46:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:46:46] <RickyRelucent> others the details
[2:46:56] <%Samex_Comex> What if one of Plague's cats is a witch that comes by for free food
[2:47:05] <%Down10_> Expenses can go up, especially if you run out of time or something disrupts filming
[2:47:06] <Presence_Eternal> Let's definitely leave the safety of the vehicle.
[2:47:49] <KineticZen> Make sure you deplete your battery by leaving the headlights on all night
[2:47:58] <RickyRelucent> and maybe its a different standard too
[2:48:25] <+Mrbaconator> it will be big sex with tons of music
[2:48:28] <+Mrbaconator> the best of both worlds
[2:48:31] <Julkson> Don't worry, we'll tell you if something happens
[2:48:32] <RickyRelucent> like tim curry
[2:48:34] <Presence_Eternal> Strangely enough I think lost time will likely be a plot point.
[2:48:36] <RickyRelucent> just have a big cat head
[2:48:37] <KineticZen> Hahahaha
[2:48:40] <kingofnymphs> oh, I guess they're in a WHOA
[2:48:40] <RickyRelucent> and let it attack someone
[2:48:41] <+Mrbaconator> I WAS RIGHT
[2:48:41] <Cozy90> turn into a bag of cocaine so he can snort it
[2:48:43] <%Samex_Comex> What the fuck!
[2:48:43] <Schuhart> Horny police! Keep your hands where I can see them!
[2:48:43] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> LUL
[2:48:44] <Dunmarkh> wtf
[2:48:48] <Presence_Eternal> Wait, that isn't boobs.
[2:48:51] <Cozy90> ?????????
[2:48:52] <%vizardrob> oh good they're here
[2:48:52] <%cooldude69xx> Oh man this is great
[2:48:53] <CubicPhantom> transitions are for the weak I guess
[2:48:53] <$SGrim> SUDDENLT
[2:48:58] <$SGrim> SUDDENLY
[2:48:58] <%Down10_> catJAM
[2:48:59] <+Mrbaconator> this songs actually not too bad
[2:49:02] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wait, what the fuck
[2:49:06] <%Samex_Comex> The no sex witches are here
[2:49:09] <%MelBrooksKA> What the fuck
[2:49:12] <DaoistNeko> catJAM
[2:49:18] <+SveriSageAdvice> where did they come from, how did they get there, we will never know
[2:49:21] <+ofblueair> catJAM
[2:49:21] <+Mrbaconator> watching the sex
[2:49:22] <Redne22> what is happening
[2:49:24] <RickyRelucent> stonehenge rituals
[2:49:28] <Schuhart> This movie seems adapted from a stage musical
[2:49:28] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Cock blocking
[2:49:36] <TwoStarPlayersNik> smash his head with a rock
[2:49:37] <+SteveSouth> is that a face down sacrifice?
[2:49:37] <%Samex_Comex> There are the drums falling down the stairs again
[2:49:50] <Redne22> this is a musical now
[2:49:53] <TwoStarPlayersNik> here I go stabbin again
[2:50:02] <RickyRelucent> wack dynamite
[2:50:05] <KineticZen> Good thing we have the Internet to keep witches from murdering people nowadays
[2:50:09] <Cozy90> those witches have great voices
[2:50:22] <+SveriSageAdvice> they just had this all set up ready to go nearby?
[2:50:34] <KineticZen> What the hell is happening
[2:50:46] <+Mrbaconator> i see tiddy
[2:50:49] <%Samex_Comex> I'm scared
[2:50:56] <+ofblueair> I'm guessing there will be no answers by the end of this either
[2:51:00] <+Mrbaconator> these drums are unironically sick
[2:51:04] <CubicPhantom> so the movie just isn't going to explain those ghost-time photographs then? okay, i guess the lithe people dance is more important
[2:51:05] <RickyRelucent> even more questions
[2:51:07] <kingofnymphs> I wonder if any of the actors enjoyed working on this or if it was just a massive chore for them
[2:51:14] <RickyRelucent> end musical
[2:51:14] <Redne22> are we killing them?
[2:51:20] <Cozy90> i want this to turn into cirque du soleil
[2:51:27] <+ofblueair> is someone dying?
[2:51:38] <Redne22> what is happening
[2:51:39] <Presence_Eternal> This is an example of what happens when a collapsing building tries to produce a movie.
[2:51:39] <Krasis404> Man, Middsomar isn't as good as everyone says it was
[2:51:43] <RickyRelucent> >i now bear your children
[2:51:44] <+SteveSouth> DS3 style wedding
[2:51:47] <+Mrbaconator> sansa is a witch what i am SHOCKED
[2:51:51] <+Mrbaconator> shocked
[2:52:08] <TwoStarPlayersNik> This teaches us that all women are potential witches
[2:52:09] <Cozy90> i now pronounce you corpse and wife. you may not bury the corpse
[2:52:24] <%sandrews> this feels like it would be creepier without the music
[2:52:42] <Redne22> is he dead?
[2:52:53] <Presence_Eternal> The horror. The horror.
[2:52:55] <+Mrbaconator> EH
[2:52:56] <Dunmarkh> wtf

[2:53:09] <+bladewolf_7> @PlagueOfGripes Hey Gripes, how long have you been doing art for?
[2:53:09] <Dunmarkh> that guy was in a dream
[2:53:21] <RickyRelucent> igor vant zex
[2:53:21] <%sandrews> they sapped that man's brain
[2:53:23] <+SveriSageAdvice> i cant even tell whats going on from the weird cuts
[2:53:25] <KineticZen> Why did they leave him alive
[2:53:29] <Redne22> what is happening?
[2:53:40] <+ofblueair> Celia explain what's happening
[2:53:44] <%Samex_Comex> Was another movie happening during this one
[2:53:48] <Dunmarkh> What the fuck
[2:53:52] <Julkson> It's like every scene was written by a different writer, and none of them talked to each other
[2:53:54] <+ofblueair> huh
[2:53:54] <Schuhart> CELIA! WHERE IS SANTA!
[2:54:00] <Dunmarkh> She just did a gamer suicide
[2:54:06] <+SveriSageAdvice> oh she ran off a cliff
[2:54:08] <Redne22> well she fell
[2:54:13] <+ofblueair> the end
[2:54:15] <+SveriSageAdvice> like the old lady from earlier said not to do
[2:54:18] <Redne22> and he left her?
[2:54:22] <%MelBrooksKA> What the fuck
[2:54:30] <Redne22> haha wtf
[2:54:30] <+ofblueair> see ya
[2:54:31] <kingofnymphs> Fuck this shit, I'm out
[2:54:33] <TwoStarPlayersNik> she became witch, then she fell and become bird. cry
[2:54:35] <%Down10_> "Peace, I'm out"
[2:54:37] <+ofblueair> that's fair
[2:54:46] <Presence_Eternal> So, anyway, a movie that makes less sense than Holy Mountain.
[2:54:51] <Julkson> "And that's how I met your mother"
[2:54:57] <%Samex_Comex> I miss Igor
[2:55:00] <RickyRelucent> vesuvius?
[2:55:00] <Schuhart> "Well. Time to burn the house down"
[2:55:04] <+ofblueair> fire yes, of course
[2:55:08] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> But why?

[2:55:21] <%MelBrooksKA> I am so confused
[2:55:26] <%impulse255dj> I arrived late although I am figuring that isn't going to impact on the confusion level of this movie?
[2:55:31] <%Down10_> Abstract filmmaking
[2:55:32] <Redne22> no
[2:55:34] <TwoStarPlayersNik> We can't stop here, this is witch country

[2:56:06] <RickyRelucent> babushka convention
[2:56:07] <Presence_Eternal> Still better than Knowing.
[2:56:09] <%Down10_> this is when I walk into any party
[2:56:12] <%sandrews> is this just italian wickerman?
[2:56:13] <CubicPhantom> that's an appropriate reaction to have to this
[2:56:14] <%Samex_Comex> Mario and his harem of witches
[2:56:15] <Dunmarkh> wow this movie was dogshit.
[2:56:16] <+ofblueair> let's all stare at each other, la la la
[2:56:19] <Cozy90> WHAT PLAGUE!?

[2:56:50] <elaboratebagel> Awesome
[2:56:51] <%Down10_> Time for some Italian horror
[2:56:52] <+ofblueair> I am left feeling bewildered and empty
[2:56:53] <KineticZen> The dung pile
[2:56:55] <+dakarplaugas> Man why do the italians even try
[2:56:56] <Presence_Eternal> I have to admit. I really loved that it ended.
[2:56:59] <%Samex_Comex> Hopefully the snow creature dose not have giant booba
[2:57:06] <%Down10_> there's a whole bunch on Amazon Prime Watch Party
[2:57:20] <$SGrim> The Monster Walks
[2:57:20] <Redne22> snow!

[2:57:22] <+Mrbaconator> snow creature
[2:57:23] <Dunmarkh> snow creature
[2:57:25] <%Bigchill___> The monster walks
[2:57:26] <%vizardrob> little shop of horrors
[2:57:28] <+ofblueair> snow creature!
[2:57:32] <Chaos_Aether> Little shop
[2:57:32] <RickyRelucent> little shop
[2:57:32] <kingofnymphs> Snow Creature sounds cool
[2:57:33] <%Down10_> The Monster Walks? Sounds cool
[2:57:33] <Redne22> snow creatures
[2:57:33] <%sandrews> hmmmm
[2:57:33] <Coystick> Last Man on Earth
[2:57:34] <DaoistNeko> wild cat because its about a wild cat
[2:57:37] <%sandrews> that's tough
[2:57:40] <TwoStarPlayersNik> but Little Shop of Horrors is an actual good movie
[2:57:40] <Schuhart> We gotta wait for Paige to rant about musicals with Little shop of horrors
[2:57:41] <%caramello_man> Little shop of horrors
[2:57:42] <TwoStarPlayersNik> oooh, ok
[2:57:49] <%impulse255dj> Little Shop featueing a very young Jack Nicholson

[2:58:02] <%sandrews> halloween mask
[2:58:05] <+ofblueair> yeah let's do it!
[2:58:05] <wolfen091> watch it just be the yeti from Rudolph
[2:58:10] <+Mrbaconator> watch the witch's mountain a second time Kappa
[2:58:12] <Redne22> i hope its a man in a parka
[2:58:21] <+ofblueair> I would still watch it if it was the yeti from Rudolph
[2:58:22] <$SGrim> TIBET
[2:58:22] <%sandrews> oh this old old
[2:58:28] <%sandrews> tibet
[2:58:31] <%MelBrooksKA> Tibet!? Banned in China
[2:58:34] <$SGrim> FREE TIBET
[2:58:35] <+ofblueair> oh yeah it's probably racist
[2:58:39] <+Mrbaconator> the mightiest mountain range THE WITCHES MOUNTAIN RANGE
[2:58:43] <RickyRelucent> but to what degree
[2:58:47] <RickyRelucent> and how blatantly
[2:58:56] <kingofnymphs> plant life?
[2:59:01] <+ofblueair> lol plant life?
[2:59:03] <rittergeist> I'll bet we'll hear the word "Chinamen" ant least once.
[2:59:05] <$SGrim> Oh no
[2:59:10] <$SGrim> Those are racism words
[2:59:11] <+dakarplaugas> OH NO
[2:59:17] <KineticZen> I guess as much as Bone Tomahawk was racist
[2:59:19] <Schuhart> Music and narrator giving me the TOS feels again
[2:59:20] <%Down10_> i dunno
[2:59:22] <%MelBrooksKA> Or don't, it could be worser
[2:59:24] <CubicPhantom> wow time-to-"primitive" was like 2 minutes
[2:59:31] <+dakarplaugas> "CRUDE AND PRIMITIVE"
[2:59:37] <%Down10_> here come that title

[3:00:48] <+Mrbaconator> yo he got a big ass
[3:01:06] <%Samex_Comex> I hope he dose not parish
[3:01:22] <CubicPhantom> what university is paying for this expedition? just go look for plants, maybe you'll find something cool
[3:01:40] <+Mrbaconator> the far flung future of 1975
[3:01:41] <Schuhart> They doing an attack for the summit
[3:01:41] <%Down10_> nah, it was filmed in Californa
[3:01:48] <%Down10_> with matte paintings
[3:02:00] <+ofblueair> lol yeah
[3:02:01] <+dakarplaugas> OH THEY DO
[3:02:03] <KineticZen> As long as they're paying
[3:02:11] <RickyRelucent> "ahh,n
[3:02:14] <RickyRelucent> fuck
[3:02:20] <RickyRelucent> "ahh, the main coarse"
[3:02:23] <Redne22> it pays the bills
[3:02:24] <%MelBrooksKA> They do, it's also really dangerous for them
[3:02:24] <+dakarplaugas> Man more fucking white people whose bodies we can't bring back
[3:02:35] <Cozy90> go home gringo rofl
[3:02:35] <%impulse255dj> To the snowy peaks of the Himalayas in search WCW legend.. THE YETTAY!!
[3:02:40] <%Down10_> oof, the reviews for this are not kind
[3:02:41] <RickyRelucent> "who's gonna be the final girl"
[3:03:03] <%Heart0fInk> Aww man! I missed the end of witch mountain!?
[3:03:16] <Schuhart> Really bad in a really good way
[3:03:19] <RickyRelucent> are the companies dead
[3:03:22] <Redne22> yes we dont know what happened
[3:03:22] <+Shaggnar> Bad in a good way if you're lucky
[3:03:24] <Presence_Eternal> The only good thing about the end of Witch Mountain was that it was the end of Witch Mountain.
[3:03:29] <%Down10_> You know it's bad when it only comes in dvd sets, not alone
[3:03:30] <+ofblueair> movies you can riff to
[3:03:30] <+Mrbaconator> any good movies get held behind the mickey mouse corrupt governement line
[3:03:34] <Sergiroth> Sadly, some stuff is just trash.
[3:03:35] <%impulse255dj> @Heart0fInk it's ok, the movie also missed the end.
[3:03:37] <+Mrbaconator> where the govt pushes copyright law back more
[3:03:38] <%Samex_Comex> I want the sherpas to carthwheel down the mountain like in the Simpsons after he dies
[3:03:54] <%Heart0fInk> I have a DVD box set of shitty old B movies
[3:03:56] <+ofblueair> oddly there are no plants out here in the snow
[3:04:04] <%MelBrooksKA> Spaceballs is good
[3:04:06] <Cozy90> man they could never do a spaceballs anymore
[3:04:31] <KineticZen> People always say that, I'm sure something will come along
[3:04:39] <%Heart0fInk> I love Spaceballs is ok
[3:04:42] <RickyRelucent> crunchy m&ms r yummy
[3:04:43] <Cozy90> i hope im wrong
[3:04:51] <%Heart0fInk> that was... a misclick...
[3:05:02] <JovianGargoyle> There are Bajorans in this movie?
[3:05:10] <+Mrbaconator> it's some kind of snow creature!
[3:05:12] <Presence_Eternal> I'm not ready for the yeti.
[3:05:21] <%Samex_Comex> Mine now
[3:05:24] <RickyRelucent> yetillin me
[3:05:27] <%Heart0fInk> Do you know what Yeti's eat?
[3:05:30] <RickyRelucent> sorry that was bad
[3:05:39] <+BlackStarAura> Always the first to go
[3:05:47] <%Heart0fInk> they eat Yeti spaghetti..
[3:05:48] <leinadtonu> yeeted be the teti
[3:05:54] <leinadtonu> yeti
[3:05:56] <%sandrews> This is ultra day for night.
[3:06:03] <%Down10_> The director W. Lee Wilder is apparently the "talentless brother" of actor/director Billy Wilder
[3:06:16] <Redne22> yeti!
[3:06:28] <%impulse255dj> @PlagueOfGripes given the age will it be 'Yeti' or 'Abominable Snowman'?
[3:06:47] <RickyRelucent> "ice bigfoot"
[3:06:57] <RickyRelucent> "arctic wendigo"
[3:07:00] <%impulse255dj> ahh
[3:07:19] <Redne22> they tell him yeti and hes like fk off and they are like ok bye
[3:07:29] <%impulse255dj> Yeoooo!
[3:07:48] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:08:18] <Julkson> "No one has seen one" says the foreigner that just arrived to the native with experience
[3:08:52] <leinadtonu> A woman is missing tho, That could be a PR disaster.
[3:09:18] <%Down10_> these movies are usually cautionary tales, more or less
[3:09:20] <%Samex_Comex> It's Yeti's wife now
[3:09:21] <bear_breaker20> village idiots somehow survives to passes on his genes to another horror movie
[3:09:47] <warandpens> @Samex_Comex OG beauty and the beast lol
[3:09:56] <%Heart0fInk> whos gonna get diddles by a yeti first?
[3:10:15] <+BlackStarAura> They’re rightfully getting the fuck out
[3:10:42] <%Samex_Comex> Sound like they are planning on taking a toboggan down the mountain
[3:10:52] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:10:53] <%impulse255dj> haha
[3:10:55] <+ofblueair> roxmLUL
[3:10:55] <+Mrbaconator> GOTTEM
[3:11:05] <Cozy90> why was he so quick to kill everyone?
[3:11:17] <+BlackStarAura> Silly white man
[3:11:19] <%Heart0fInk> well they are white...
[3:11:20] <Dunmarkh> this movie might be alright
[3:11:23] <warandpens> The locals have been through this crap before
[3:11:25] <Cozy90> i mean i guess that happens at my work so its accurate
[3:11:39] <$SGrim> @Cozy90 because rich white men would likely not view Nepalese Sherpa as people.
[3:11:45] <Schuhart> Call in an air-strike
[3:11:57] <Redne22> lol
[3:12:15] <%Samex_Comex> But his name is perish
[3:12:18] <warandpens> He's monologuing from Hell
[3:12:28] <Dunmarkh> what if he narrates his death and it's really meta
[3:12:57] <Dunmarkh> the real snow creature was white people
[3:12:59] <marklarphd> The Yeti was the friends we made along the way
[3:13:03] <leinadtonu> maybe he is the yeti's new wife
[3:13:04] <%Heart0fInk> you forgot to change the title @PlagueOfGripes
[3:13:07] <%Down10_> This movie was the "first and the worst" Yeti movie
[3:13:14] <%impulse255dj> there's a little yeti in all of us.
[3:13:28] <%Samex_Comex> The blue yeti is not that bad
[3:13:32] <RickyRelucent> royalty free wind sounds
[3:13:38] <+BlackStarAura> The Thing is actually good
[3:13:38] <Schuhart> That's what i thought when I saw the barren, frozen cliffs in the beginning
[3:13:49] <+emperordread> The real Yeti was the friends we made along the way
[3:13:55] <kingofnymphs> Havent been WHAT?
[3:14:04] <+ofblueair> wow
[3:14:05] <Schuhart> Gods, The Thing is such a fantastic movie
[3:14:07] <%Heart0fInk> This is like the thing. only stupider
[3:14:19] <+ofblueair> the thing is so good
[3:14:34] <warandpens> Suba is the best
[3:14:35] <+Mrbaconator> LUL
[3:14:38] <RickyRelucent> don't worry, the fear of the yeti will have them eating themselves from the inside out
[3:14:41] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[3:14:41] <%Samex_Comex> What
[3:14:47] <+ofblueair> fuck your radio
[3:14:49] <%Heart0fInk> LOL
[3:14:50] <Schuhart> First minister Shakaar. When the walls fell.
[3:14:54] <warandpens> This man is literally a legend
[3:14:56] <kingofnymphs> Why cut off the only comms?
[3:15:01] <%Heart0fInk> I love his fuckin laugh
[3:15:06] <Cozy90> that wipper snapper
[3:15:20] <+BlackStarAura> Suba is the real hero
[3:15:33] <+dakarplaugas> Suba is amazing
[3:15:54] <%Bigchill___> Cap off the night
[3:16:16] <%Bigchill___> To make is sound normal
[3:16:18] <Cozy90> they have alot of resonance rings in that area. they should pull in some phantoms for help
[3:16:20] <%Bigchill___> I guess
[3:16:23] <+ofblueair> time to drink
[3:16:52] <%Samex_Comex> Get the yeti drunk
[3:16:53] <RickyRelucent> i should hold back on the scotch
[3:17:03] <+ofblueair> it looks so good
[3:17:04] <%Murphio_GS> Proportions hard
[3:17:06] <%impulse255dj> Because it warms you before bed. Its from the era when people wore caps to bed.
[3:17:11] <%Heart0fInk> yee
[3:17:14] <+emperordread> art is basically magic
[3:17:28] <elaboratebagel> I don't understand how you draw like that and don't go insane
[3:17:33] <leinadtonu> I don't understand art, you guys are like magicians to me.
[3:17:37] <RickyRelucent> no its just tens of thousands
[3:17:42] <RickyRelucent> or hundred thousands
[3:17:44] <Schuhart> Absolutely. I'm lazy and do way too few  rounds of lines
[3:17:45] <RickyRelucent> of tiny ass
[3:17:50] <RickyRelucent> mini strokes
[3:18:09] <RickyRelucent> like plague says, layers
[3:18:13] <RickyRelucent> : 3
[3:18:27] <+ofblueair> yeti's wearing crocs
[3:18:28] <Presence_Eternal> Oh man, someone owns Moon Boots!
[3:18:51] <%Murphio_GS> What if the yeti is cute?
[3:18:55] <%Murphio_GS> and not scary
[3:19:00] <+Mrbaconator> the yeti got a thicc dumpy
[3:19:02] <+ofblueair> uwu yeti
[3:19:06] <leinadtonu> Yetii have no toes to avoid frostbite
[3:19:17] <$SGrim> @Murphio_GS Then we make crossbreeding the aim of the mssion.
[3:19:19] <RickyRelucent> i dont dig the moses desert track they have going rn
[3:19:21] <$SGrim> mission*
[3:19:26] <+ofblueair> Yeti just has one big block of foot
[3:19:29] <%Murphio_GS> Do they just have elephant stumps? lmao
[3:19:34] <warandpens> This weirdly reminds me of Uncharted 2 that had the yeti in it
[3:20:09] <RickyRelucent> yeti's are evolved mammoths
[3:20:17] <RickyRelucent> and bigfoot is one who migrated to forests
[3:20:26] <%Murphio_GS> Where in the Himalayans is this even
[3:20:39] <Schuhart> Much like the Best of the Worst movies!
[3:20:39] <%Murphio_GS> Is it Tibet? Bhutan?
[3:20:41] <%Heart0fInk> Can't be more than the last movie
[3:20:41] <%cosmicleviathan18> walking around is about 90% of these kinds of movies LUL
[3:20:42] <%impulse255dj> Tibet
[3:20:42] <%Samex_Comex> At least the music is not horrible
[3:20:45] <+ofblueair> filler filler filler
[3:20:54] <BisoromiBear> Japanese Tibet
[3:20:56] <kingofnymphs> I cant wait for the yeti to be revealed and it looks awful
[3:21:02] <RickyRelucent> alot of establishing shots
[3:21:08] <RickyRelucent> ahh here we go
[3:21:14] <warandpens> Lawrence of Arabia but worse and with Mountains
[3:21:18] <Schuhart> LIGHT UP THE NIGHT!
[3:21:33] <%MelBrooksKA> Instead of making scenes they just had the actors walk to the next place and just filmed it
[3:21:35] <kingofnymphs> Even Subara could not fight the darkness without the Keyblade
[3:21:39] <%Heart0fInk> Suba the keyblade weilder
[3:21:46] <%Heart0fInk> FUCK
[3:21:54] <+ofblueair> spbO3

[3:22:35] <%Samex_Comex> Dave the native
[3:22:51] <%Down10_> Too late, we recorded the dialog already
[3:22:51] <%cooldude69xx> I dont think the writer knew any tibetan names
[3:22:53] <+ofblueair> the fucking traveling music in these old movies cracks me up
[3:23:00] <%Heart0fInk> he's white. he doesn't care about a natives name
[3:23:06] <%Down10_> heyyyyy
[3:23:08] <%Samex_Comex> The yeti has long limbs like me
[3:23:13] <+ofblueair> LUL
[3:23:16] <RickyRelucent> convenient paths to walk on in the himalayas
[3:23:19] <RickyRelucent> no death gorges
[3:23:22] <RickyRelucent> or anything
[3:23:22] <leinadtonu> Is he Willy E. Coyote?
[3:23:26] <RickyRelucent> wet stone steps
[3:23:27] <%impulse255dj> That was his name, Native McGillicuddy.
[3:23:27] <RickyRelucent> nuttin
[3:23:34] <%Heart0fInk> he's gonna bonk their noodles
[3:23:43] <wolfen091> he just got out of hibernation, he ain't no fat bear thats for sure

[3:25:33] <+Mrbaconator> he has madoka posters on his cave walls
[3:25:34] <%Murphio_GS> Maybe you should draw a bunch of pirates to practice your tricorn skills?
[3:25:44] <Cozy90> like hello kitty bed cute?
[3:25:44] <%Heart0fInk> that... was mistake. ignore that
[3:26:15] <+ofblueair> sexy clouds

[3:40:02] <Dunmarkh> It will job to some scientist like that gorilla
[3:40:23] <+SveriSageAdvice> i have a vague memory but i swear there was a Goosebumps book that based itself off this movie?
[3:40:31] <JovianGargoyle> ah, no Yetis on a Plane
[3:40:35] <+SveriSageAdvice> The Snowman of Pasadena i think?
[3:41:03] <Presence_Eternal> That's also what the non natives call him.
[3:41:16] <Dunmarkh> yes.

[3:41:34] <+CalderGaming> ah but this is in LA so there's nothing to climb
[3:41:35] <+ofblueair> snow kong
[3:41:37] <%Heart0fInk> pretty much
[3:41:48] <+CalderGaming> the yeti will have to settle for jumping on a lot of cars
[3:41:56] <%Murphio_GS> Glass is expensive
[3:41:58] <+ofblueair> it's a meast
[3:42:02] <+Mrbaconator> where's the yetis green card
[3:42:09] <Daxalog> Im glad hes in there.

[3:43:10] <%Murphio_GS> Science is for dorks who like doing things. Unlike me, mr. judgmental for no reason man
[3:43:15] <%Murphio_GS> Igor was amazing
[3:43:19] <+Mrbaconator> like i said igor was the best part
[3:43:22] <%impulse255dj> Twist. The movie becomes a civil rights court drama.
[3:43:41] <%Samex_Comex> Herman, Igor, and the Yeti
[3:43:56] <wolfen091> offers him a cigarette...  imagine if he offered him a vape stick
[3:43:56] <%Murphio_GS> "It's for your health"
[3:44:00] <+ofblueair> just constant chimney
[3:44:26] <%Murphio_GS> god everyone must've smelt like shit

[3:45:42] <+CalderGaming> WhAt??
[3:45:44] <%MelBrooksKA> Chicken wings done
[3:45:45] <leinadtonu> HE HATES THE HORNY!
[3:45:45] <+Mrbaconator> i need that with a cartoon sound effect
[3:45:46] <%silvery_cricket> Okay I got here late, how is this related to communism
[3:45:58] <%silvery_cricket> and how communism is SPOOOOKY
[3:46:04] <+ofblueair> the yeti's a commie
[3:46:16] <leinadtonu> Long-armed commies
[3:46:27] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no he got another wife
[3:46:28] <%silvery_cricket> @ofblueair See from this era of film making it could be, so I cant tell if you are pulling my chain.
[3:46:42] <%Murphio_GS> Yeti is a representation of chinese imperialism on tibet,... or it's just a yeti
[3:46:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:47:07] <+CalderGaming> well the yeti is from the himalayas which is NEAR China, even though the "locals" there were Japanese because crappy B movie I guess
[3:47:29] <%silvery_cricket> I look forward to them shooting the Yeti dead and finding a hammer and sickle on him
[3:47:45] <Presence_Eternal> I wonder what the Yeti's Dunbar Number is.
[3:47:54] <%Murphio_GS> He's so shapely
[3:47:55] <%silvery_cricket> Yeti be thick
[3:48:06] <wolfen091> yeti has a picture of lennin in his wallet
[3:48:07] <+ofblueair> trial and error kinda thing
[3:48:11] <%MelBrooksKA> I love how the yeti ominously fades into the darkness after it kills
[3:48:18] <%KellBeII> lotta them just walking around
[3:48:23] <RickyRelucent> i like the scp they feed old horror movies
[3:48:25] <%Murphio_GS> I like the idea of the yeti having a wallet
[3:48:30] <RickyRelucent> cuz they're scared of letting him have cthulu ass shit
[3:48:45] <%silvery_cricket> How is this Yeti sneaking around so well, shouldnt the sounds of his ass cheeks clapping alert the guards?
[3:48:45] <+ofblueair> there's an scp they feed old horror movies?
[3:48:56] <%Murphio_GS> nice
[3:49:02] <wolfen091> nah hes gangly, his ass don't cla0
[3:49:05] <wolfen091> clap
[3:49:06] <+SveriSageAdvice> i cant believe there were people who used to faint seeing this kind of stuff in movie theaters
[3:49:11] <+ofblueair> his ass flops
[3:49:13] <leinadtonu> This is a very Batman-like Yeti.
[3:49:14] <Presence_Eternal> There's so many scps. I think one is a haunted graphics card or something.
[3:49:33] <%Murphio_GS> Batyeti
[3:49:44] <+CalderGaming> @SveriSageAdvice just like how people thought The Mind's Eye and Reboot looked amazing in the 90s
[3:49:52] <wolfen091> yetis moms name is martha
[3:49:58] <Cozy90> ill kill that yeti so hard that he dies
[3:50:00] <+ofblueair> LUL
[3:50:02] <Presence_Eternal> Turns out the yeti is a furry.
[3:50:17] <leinadtonu> A wife killed his parents... Now he hunts wives
[3:50:18] <Presence_Eternal> Just get him some fox ears and he'll calm down.
[3:50:21] <%MelBrooksKA> "Is the yeti a commie?"
[3:50:24] <%silvery_cricket> "Tell everyone to remain calm we have a communist yeti on the lose... again"
[3:50:28] <+ofblueair> really proactive strategy there
[3:50:29] <%Heart0fInk> Even hookers
[3:50:50] <+CalderGaming> "We'll get him, right after our three martini lunch that consists entirely of vodka"
[3:51:03] <Presence_Eternal> Don't answer the door if you hear loud roaring.
[3:51:14] <%silvery_cricket> "He might be a communist so stay away"
[3:51:22] <+ofblueair> we were dumb and brought this creature from the Himalayas to here and it has escaped as expected
[3:51:26] <wolfen091> a dangerous killer beast is at large... his name is patty ohulighan
[3:51:34] <%silvery_cricket> "He may try and unionize the work force so keep your doors locked tight"
[3:52:04] <smile64> yur words bore meh
[3:52:10] <+ofblueair> yer werds
[3:52:24] <+ofblueair> I only want to hear your farts from now on
[3:52:35] <%silvery_cricket> "If I am not fucking a woman that sounds like fat albert having a stroke, then I dont want you"
[3:52:37] <zevenmillion> "He may tempt you with wild fantasies like Womens Rights, please do not be swayed"
[3:52:43] <smile64> something about old movie scores just warms my heart
[3:52:46] <%Murphio_GS> Yeti knows how to pick em
[3:52:48] <%MelBrooksKA> I thought that siren was the lady screaming
[3:53:25] <Presence_Eternal> The yeti was just looking to get hooked up with some benadryl.
[3:53:29] <%silvery_cricket> "He tried to hand her a flyer about worker's rights"
[3:53:34] <classical_gomez> When is the Snow Creature going to be in Dead by Daylight?
[3:53:36] <smile64> to get in a 45 minute line to pick up my meds
[3:54:01] <wolfen091> @classical_gomez dude get some old school campy monsters in, im down
[3:54:23] <%silvery_cricket> The idea of the Yeti just being a hardcore communist makes me chuckle
[3:54:23] <%impulse255dj> 1954
[3:54:27] <smile64> 1954 according to my 5 second internet search
[3:54:53] <elaboratebagel> This track is actually a reference to witch mountain
[3:54:54] <%Murphio_GS> He has a giant something or other
[3:55:30] <%silvery_cricket> "Beware of a communist Yeti attempting to impregnate our men and educate our women!"
[3:56:07] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @silvery_cricket Yeti? chonkyyCult
[3:56:22] <%Samex_Comex> Is he turning people into yeti's?
[3:56:30] <%silvery_cricket> @FilthyHereticHorus Yes that communist is a Yeti
[3:56:34] <+ofblueair> really? a yeti without wings?
[3:56:50] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @FilthyHereticHorus chonkyyDisgust
[3:56:52] <Presence_Eternal> Plot twist: TWO yetis!
[3:56:52] <Zebroneath> walking around in an oil barrel
[3:57:11] <+ofblueair> sus
[3:57:26] <%MelBrooksKA> Beware of a commie Yeti trained by the Russian Spetsnaz!
[3:57:27] <%silvery_cricket> HE IS GONNA TRY AND UNIONIZE THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT
[3:57:28] <warandpens> Yeti played Arkham Asylam
[3:58:17] <%MelBrooksKA> He's evolving far faster than we could have predicted!
[3:58:30] <wolfen091> the funny thing is, they don't keep those charts on storm drains or anything past 3 years
[3:58:32] <Goergorion> just wait for it to rain alot and flood the drain
[3:58:39] <kingofnymphs> Did I miss anything?
[3:58:56] <%KellBeII> seems like a british name
[3:58:56] <smile64> that being said walkie talkies are awesome
[3:59:09] <smile64> the talker walker
[3:59:14] <+BinaryFireball> the boogie woogie bugle boy of company b
[3:59:18] <+ofblueair> well walk talk is stupid
[3:59:23] <%silvery_cricket> "Communist yetis in the sewers, reminds me of the war"
[3:59:28] <Dunmarkh> Must have been invented by a british person
[3:59:38] <%MelBrooksKA> Should have named it the iTalk
[3:59:40] <%Heart0fInk> A Speaky Trotty
[3:59:50] <kingofnymphs> Is this a new movie?
[4:00:05] <+ofblueair> yes
[4:00:07] <%MelBrooksKA> Wait, are they going down there with no guns?
[4:00:11] <%Heart0fInk> @kingofnymphs Yes. Made in the year of our lord of 2021
[4:00:23] <+ofblueair> where's our boy?
[4:00:27] <kingofnymphs> lol forget it
[4:00:38] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes the actual name is Handheld Transceiver, but the English nicknamed them Walkie-Talkies and it stuck.
[4:00:44] <+ofblueair> it's "Snow Creatures" 1959
[4:00:46] <%Down10_> I didn't put on "The Snow Creature" to see things that are not a snow creature
[4:00:52] <+ofblueair> 1954*
[4:00:59] <Goergorion> where is da boi
[4:01:07] <kingofnymphs> Oh this is still snow creature? Fucking weird
[4:01:33] <+CalderGaming> yeah they flew from the himalayas to LA for the second half
[4:01:36] <+ofblueair> it's never a good thing when they go in the sewer
[4:02:25] <%MelBrooksKA> "The sewers, my natural habitat!" - Tibetan Yeti
[4:02:31] <+ofblueair> walking, so much walking, and talking
[4:02:41] <Presence_Eternal> It may have a crappy plot, but at least the special effects are impressive.
[4:03:14] <%Down10_> this movie is designed to be played late at night and put you to sleep
[4:03:21] <Cozy90> "hey boys i just saw a glowing red man running around. He made some weird follow me gestrures."
[4:03:48] <%KellBeII> DB cooper
[4:03:59] <%MelBrooksKA> I feel like they've reused that shot of the yeti coming in and out of the darkness like 5 times
[4:03:59] <Cozy90> kellbell holy fuck that was fast
[4:04:01] <+lordericter> I have arrived for the tail end of this it seems, art gripe today was great plague
[4:04:20] <SanderDCastle> That was a great story told by Rich Evans
[4:04:26] <%KellBeII> im always prepared for big foot vs db cooper
[4:04:33] <+lordericter> funny to see Paige defend fuckin Birdly
[4:04:34] <%Heart0fInk> Anderson Cooper
[4:05:21] <+FilthyHereticHorus> @PlagueOfGripes W. Lee Wilder directed this
[4:05:50] <%Samex_Comex> In the darkness out the darkness in the darkness out the darkness

[4:06:27] <$SGrim> Dies to a .38? Lame!
[4:06:30] <%Down10_> that would be a hell of a plot twist
[4:06:31] <+lordericter> what a tiny handgun
[4:06:32] <+ofblueair> well that was anticlimactic
[4:06:47] <+ofblueair> not fair, yeti doesn't have a gun! D:
[4:06:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:07:04] <%Down10_> that tiny short range pistol falls the Yeti. bad ending

[4:07:28] <+dakarplaugas> People have died
[4:07:29] <+ofblueair> well that's it, end of the movie
[4:07:39] <+dakarplaugas> The fuck is wrong with these people
