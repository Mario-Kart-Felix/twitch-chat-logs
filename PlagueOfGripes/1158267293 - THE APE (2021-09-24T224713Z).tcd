[0:08:19] <mrundisclosed2> I feel like the fur could be darker but otherwise it's clearly got a lot more face for a lot more expression.
[0:08:23] <+KenAshcorp> I was thinking Serval for the long ears
[0:08:24] <whittacre> yay lynx! awesome cats who scream like girls

[0:09:46] <SoFarFetched> voobers
[0:09:51] <moonsaber99> this may be a little esoteric, but it does not really feel like "you" it's really cutsie and you have a different vibe
[0:09:58] <+legioned247> fangs long fangs
[0:10:00] <GalacticaBantam> are you keeping the hat?
[0:10:02] <Jetsfantasy> @KenAshcorp Draw him in the drip pose, that's how
[0:10:03] <%DeadlyPeaks> Have creepyporpoise do it. Her model is great
[0:10:10] <SoFarFetched> pretty much it seems
[0:10:12] <whittacre> you're right, not enough grungy robot vubers
[0:10:17] <SoFarFetched> since you got groups and they "graduate"
[0:10:18] <MLGprokactus> omg yess caught a live stream
[0:10:26] <SoFarFetched> like AKB48 has idols that graduate.
[0:10:31] <+Tr1pkT12> Vtubers also do some idol singing stuff, the popular ones
[0:10:37] <SoFarFetched> and then you got the side AKB groups that aren't AS important

[0:11:20] <%DeadlyPeaks> You have a beautiful voice
[0:11:22] <+KenAshcorp> "not well known for being a beautiful human being" Many may disagree with this statement
[0:11:22] <wolfen091> please do
[0:11:28] <SoFarFetched> If I ever did Vtubing it would just be my character. Human I feel would be odd.
[0:11:36] <+legioned247> I want to pet Eli lynx form

[0:13:44] <whittacre> same here. it's a very hard habit to break
[0:13:51] <Jetsfantasy> Yeah. The whole "family doesn't pay family" thing my family does didn't help me with the same thing
[0:14:00] <+KenAshcorp> Please remember that your worth as a human being is far more than you think. I really do hope you can be financially stable
[0:14:41] <tanarath> Plague, I wish you'd had $ earlier, but I'm glad you have it. You're a real person.
[0:15:09] <tanarath> Plague, furry porn.

[0:16:08] <+KenAshcorp> Regardless I do hope you can make a living, more to support yourself
[0:16:17] <+legioned247> your pokemon were so good
[0:16:33] <+SkookumHime> skooku2Yikes
[0:16:48] <+legioned247> but your complaints are valid
[0:17:07] <$saw6boy> my man, I feel that... I have such an ingrained fear of spending money that my first year of college in almost started because I didn't want to spend money on food
[0:17:08] <locobo98> just gave a banner that links people to the patron
[0:17:25] <$saw6boy> starved not started
[0:17:31] <%Bigchill___> I feel that
[0:17:40] <+legioned247> my internet bad
[0:17:56] <tanarath> Lets watch the Ape!
[0:17:58] <locobo98> monke
[0:17:59] <+legioned247> but I still trying to watch
[0:18:12] <whittacre> vote for snow creature
[0:18:13] <%Bigchill___> They all sound old-era amazing
[0:18:13] <SoFarFetched> Vampire bat intrigues me
[0:18:14] <+SkookumHime> cheer20
[0:18:18] <+legioned247> witness ape
[0:18:31] <+starhammer_games> @PlagueOfGripes is there a reason you picked your avatar to be a purple cat?
[0:18:38] <SkookumHime> c:
[0:18:43] <%Bigchill___> are you a princess of Skookum?
[0:18:43] <%waffle_stache> A lot of youtube channels start of being popular with negativity then it loses steam and they just want to be themselves
[0:18:48] <lewdnekojam> you were saying words
[0:19:02] <locobo98> working nightshifts always makes me super depressed, but getting to watch the stream helps a lot, thank you Eli, this means a lot to me
[0:19:04] <Samex_Comex> Mmm blitz ball
[0:19:07] <warandpens> How do you compartmentalize the two personalities?
[0:19:15] <+legioned247> I mean I think of it as a different opinion
[0:19:15] <%PleasantLee> I love that blitzball video
[0:19:18] <+Jekado> When is Blitz Ball gonna be in FFXIV...
[0:19:38] <whittacre> I think the blitzball ep was a perfect example of your "character"
[0:19:42] <Stillchr> so plague is actually cat
[0:19:43] <Laecerelius> Plague's a grumpy kitty
[0:19:55] <locobo98> a but more cuddly
[0:20:18] <wolfen091> its a good icon though
[0:20:25] <locobo98> could have just used that icon
[0:20:31] <%waffle_stache> Very Iconic
[0:20:52] <%DeadlyPeaks> I like the kitty & the plaid
[0:21:12] <+starhammer_games> I think it's interesting and different
[0:21:14] <locobo98> so go to his patreon Yall
[0:21:26] <locobo98> fling money wildly towards plague
[0:21:33] <%Bigchill___> I remember your making emotes video back in the day
[0:21:36] <locobo98> pelt him with your spare change every moth
[0:21:37] <SoFarFetched> oh for emotes? yeah
[0:21:44] <%waffle_stache> Same I got paid to do some and they came out very off
[0:21:45] <SoFarFetched> you can't go TOO much detail or you end up squinting
[0:22:00] <locobo98> by only checking a dollar a month it helps feed him a can of fancy feast
[0:22:05] <SoFarFetched> like Im a fan of these ones I use because they are pretty clean and simple on details geefBlank
[0:22:08] <SkookumHime> plague, your style would lend to making vtuber models
[0:22:20] <SuperVaderMan> lynxes have big goofy paws and they're cute :3
[0:22:39] <whittacre> don't forget the screaming!
[0:22:42] <JovianGargoyle> Big ol legs
[0:22:49] <%Bigchill___> this song sounds very humming urban stereo
[0:23:00] <lewdnekojam> spooky skeleton
[0:23:06] <SkookumHime> Lynx make funny noises tho
[0:23:39] <Xunvia> F L O O F. bo8Comfy
[0:24:02] <%Bigchill___> Dantan does good stuff crendorFrog1
[0:24:12] <Getseriasss> hey plague, loved the new video
[0:24:49] <Samex_Comex> I want to know how to make the animated emotes
[0:25:32] <+legioned247> wait you made a new video
[0:25:35] <cooldude69xx> Liking the cool colors for an evening shot
[0:25:39] <+legioned247> cool
[0:26:13] <Stillchr> silvermom
[0:26:28] <%Bigchill___> @PlagueOfGripes I never saw Iron mouse respond to your strong pic of her, did she like it?
[0:26:50] <locobo98> let's draw some phat tiddies
[0:26:53] <%HaunchPaunch> "Artistic liberties" if you will
[0:26:59] <SuperVaderMan> one piece girls are always a treat
[0:27:15] <lemoan> oh cool. the cute squirrel mink
[0:27:15] <SoFarFetched> ironically Im getting commissioned a reference pic for my character cause my drawing skills haven't been great. So wanted something clean if I ever do commissions.
[0:27:17] <%Bigchill___> ahh
[0:27:31] <Samex_Comex> Her hair gives her super strength
[0:27:37] <madiethemagepc> hi plauge love your gripe vids
[0:28:41] <locobo98> Z list celebrity
[0:28:52] <SuperVaderMan> I think you're a solid B SeemsGood
[0:28:57] <SoFarFetched> You got that weird, you're either TOO known for a very specific thing but also not TOO well known.
[0:29:00] <jaypeesan> Is that a proctology exam drawing?
[0:29:12] <Samex_Comex> A big D
[0:29:18] <SoFarFetched> Like how the vtubers reacted to your pokemon video.
[0:29:39] <%vizardrob> hello
[0:30:19] <wolfen091> its a hard pill to swallow, but we've all been toxic at some point in our lives, its how you learn and grow from that experience that defines you
[0:30:27] <Namboto> this is why I want to go the Toby Fox route and just be as little of a public figure as possible if I gain any sort of audience
[0:30:39] <dk_scrub> will I have to hide my screen from my music students during this stream?
[0:30:39] <jaypeesan> good one XD
[0:30:47] <jonnyjargon> who is this character from
[0:30:54] <SoFarFetched> looks One Piece
[0:31:11] <cooldude69xx> That sounds like the sweet spot of fame, imo
[0:31:21] <MortalArrowGames> from one piece
[0:31:27] <Samex_Comex> "Sex and stake my favorite pair, I have them both very rare"
[0:31:27] <lemoan> @jonnyjargon Trisha from One Piece
[0:31:34] <%waffle_stache> Once I found the Picarto and start trek stuff I Finally understood who Eli was vs Plauge
[0:31:47] <MortalArrowGames> side character that helps heal up team during current arcs every once in while with chopper
[0:32:18] <darthlordbambi> Oooh Plague got a V-tube avi, nice
[0:32:27] <%vizardrob> I first saw your resident evil animation for 2 best friends
[0:32:27] <SoFarFetched> Its like a weird not quite "one hit wonder" but with "memes" thing.
[0:32:29] <Indigoblade> bill cosby
[0:32:38] <warandpens> Sounds like Shane Dawson lol
[0:32:49] <madiethemagepc> thoughts on one peice character design?
[0:32:56] <Xunvia> I found you through your GW2 video about Kormir. LUL
[0:33:04] <locobo98> you're a good person plague, just dont roofy people
[0:33:08] <Xunvia> Or was it GW1...
[0:33:15] <Xunvia> I think GW1.
[0:33:18] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, I often worry about how angry and perverted you are.
[0:33:30] <ralphwiggum16> That's the first thing I think of, all these years.
[0:34:10] <ralphwiggum16> Awwww. Plague's talking about bullying.
[0:34:37] <ralphwiggum16> Well, I'll always support you Plague. I don't know why, but I will.
[0:35:16] <SkookumHime> I'm a nobody so no worries about what I'm known for lol
[0:35:17] <%Bigchill___> triangle girl and tour guide nixon?
[0:35:38] <dk_scrub> tour guide nixon cemented the plague love
[0:35:50] <ralphwiggum16> The first time I ever saw you was Dark Souls, I think, but I believe that I saw your art somewhere years earlier because I remembered your name.
[0:35:56] <%waffle_stache> Eli has given me a lot of things to think about and consider since I found his art gripes first THEN I saw the animations
[0:35:59] <ralphwiggum16> Were you on newgrounds ever?
[0:36:05] <%silvery_cricket> Oh hey its Milky
[0:36:05] <Samex_Comex> I remember the chat helped picking what stupid things to put of Pat's gun for the terminator intro
[0:36:11] <%Bigchill___> THE DEVILSSS PITTT
[0:36:24] <%Bigchill___> kids love the devils pit
[0:36:43] <%DeadlyPeaks> I liked predator college
[0:37:11] <whittacre> to paraghrase Joe Pera "it calms me down to think that one day I will die and nobody will remember me"
[0:37:11] <%Bigchill___> the huge quest?
[0:37:29] <+Scevda> Evening Eli.
[0:37:33] <+legioned247> cool
[0:37:49] <+Scevda> You still peruse tg or qst?
[0:37:51] <+legioned247> dam it
[0:37:53] <lewdnekojam> honesty being respected by your peers is more worth it than general fame
[0:38:00] <+legioned247> really
[0:38:26] <%PleasantLee> gauged could be on some archive site
[0:39:18] <+legioned247> I be honest your pokemon blood born and sonic rouse video got me
[0:39:19] <%boltman_37> you have so many interesting stories
[0:39:46] <whittacre> it's so dumb, I love it
[0:39:52] <+legioned247> it the blood
[0:39:57] <whittacre> "What's that smell?" It's Blood!
[0:40:00] <cooldude69xx> It doesn't have to, absurdity is great sometimes
[0:40:03] <SkookumHime> I actually had this conversation and I said I didn't care if I made it "famous" I just wanted a nice dedicated community whether its 10 people or more. its just nice to know someone is waiting for ya.
[0:40:03] <+Scevda> Bloodbank is the stand out.
[0:40:06] <SuperVaderMan> Just repeat the same phrase over and over again, that's peak comedy
[0:40:08] <%Bigchill___> I remember another early one was the Game Grumps one where Arin hung him self
[0:40:11] <%silvery_cricket> The joke ITS BLOOD is better than the actual video
[0:40:13] <+legioned247> this is a blood bank sir
[0:40:17] <%PleasantLee> hey 'just two things' tshirts were all the rage
[0:40:20] <wolfen091> its blud, thats what it is
[0:40:25] <jaypeesan> This is basically my reaction to most of the stuff on youtube
[0:40:27] <%waffle_stache> The internet loves shit that makes no sense
[0:40:39] <whittacre> oh, it's just a snickers bar... Wait! there's blood inside!
[0:40:39] <Drakelash> I thought I was looking at Nurse Joy for a hot second
[0:41:02] <Samex_Comex> That should be a thing just putting to random things together and playing it straight
[0:41:02] <+legioned247> Eli every time I get my blood drawn at the doctor I play your blood born video
[0:41:06] <+Scevda> The ff 10 ripping was fucking hilarious.
[0:41:26] <+legioned247> and random yell it the blood
[0:41:29] <ralphwiggum16> I'm disturbed, personally.
[0:41:31] <Laecerelius> Man that FF10 video was a trip
[0:41:32] <$JobbedBone> I lost it at the mental break joke LUL
[0:41:38] <+legioned247> lol
[0:41:39] <ralphwiggum16> Everyone else, you're all disturbed, right?
[0:42:39] <+legioned247> Eli I could never be myself I too weird
[0:42:43] <ralphwiggum16> I would rather you try to be somebody else, Plague.
[0:42:49] <+Scevda> I think plenty of animators are in that same ball park.
[0:42:51] <+crowmium> everyone feels that way tbh
[0:42:51] <%boltman_37> what's the music in the background, sounds nice
[0:42:52] <%PleasantLee> yup. got a friend like that
[0:43:03] <%waffle_stache> Yeah i'm a weirdo too
[0:43:05] <%PleasantLee> "20 minutes, I want to shower first" 1 hour later
[0:43:09] <lewdnekojam> i enjoy you as you are honestly
[0:43:09] <%silvery_cricket> Is this the secretly try and get Paige into One Piece stream? Are we gonna talk about Brook alot?
[0:43:15] <+legioned247> I yell it the blood while getting my blood drawn
[0:43:23] <Angerest> once 5min became 14 hours
[0:43:26] <+crowmium> we have mores and folkways to normalize behavior among all of our oddities
[0:43:34] <whittacre> I sold my friend on watching the blitzball vid by saying "it's about 10 minutes of ffX summary then 30 minutes of shitting on the Goers"
[0:43:36] <+legioned247> what that smell
[0:43:41] <%boltman_37> thank you!
[0:43:43] <+crowmium> so we all reign it in
[0:43:48] <+Scevda> Hellen Heller lol
[0:43:51] <%Garrtoon> You're the funniest weirdo I know, boss.  Keep it up
[0:43:54] <lemoan> @silvery_cricket oh yeah she probably would like brook
[0:43:54] <+legioned247> it the blood your drawing from me it the blood
[0:44:13] <+Scevda> I am reminded of Tem tem for this one.
[0:44:28] <%Bigchill___> I loved it
[0:44:32] <whittacre> it's so good
[0:44:35] <+crowmium> it did
[0:44:41] <+crowmium> it's great
[0:44:46] <+legioned247> lol
[0:44:55] <%PleasantLee> it works. you analyze the setting, and shit all over the goers
[0:44:56] <+Scevda> The tirade got me silent laughing for doing so so harf.
[0:45:31] <Samex_Comex> I like Graav
[0:45:37] <+crowmium> she's smart enough to get the joke I think
[0:45:45] <whittacre> I think it helped a bunch of people realize how nonsense the story is, but people still love it despite that
[0:45:57] <ralphwiggum16> I remember one time I wrote a letter to you on reddit, and everyone liked it, but then I said "hey Plague, here's my letter, now we can be friends!" and you said you would never read it.
[0:46:11] <+legioned247> I agree with your breath of the wild video eli after 40 hours of playing it having your weapon breaks suck
[0:46:29] <+Scevda> Same, i can’t pick up on the humor “wavelength” of others.
[0:47:01] <ralphwiggum16> I think you actually did read it and referenced it later.
[0:47:10] <lewdnekojam> we live in honk honk society and not everyone in the circus is a clown
[0:47:27] <$JobbedBone> its a broken system because content isn't required to tag sampled material upon ingest, so you get remix trolls trying to compete with the original work for claims
[0:47:35] <+Bucketman42> Cheer100 I feel I owe you this after so many hours of content. Thank you
[0:47:35] <ralphwiggum16> Oh man, same here!
[0:47:41] <+Scevda> I just enjoy the 1 in 1000 when my off the cuff joke hits just right with whom im talking about.
[0:47:42] <%Bigchill___> You do it to Paige alot
[0:47:45] <+legioned247> the game needed a better mechanic
[0:47:53] <SuperVaderMan> Seeing this side character girl reminds me, have you seen the unnamed giant fox lady from the recent chapters of My Hero Academia?
[0:47:58] <Samex_Comex> zoneBurg
[0:48:11] <el_r0berto> if you have a cigarette you need to extinguish: who do you call?
[0:48:18] <%vizardrob> the hero we deserve
[0:48:20] <whittacre> "There's a slight drip under my sink, WHAT DO I DO?!?"
[0:48:27] <SanderDCastle> lol
[0:48:33] <%Bigchill___> My work here is finished
[0:48:34] <+legioned247> I got to poop give me your bucket 🪣
[0:48:42] <+Scevda> Bucket of many things.
[0:49:06] <+legioned247> Bucketman scream noooo
[0:49:06] <+Scevda> Odo’s favorite hero.
[0:49:08] <+Jekado> SharkOfGripes
[0:49:13] <%boltman_37> 100= 1$
[0:49:18] <+Jekado> er SnarkOfGripes
[0:49:21] <el_r0berto> it's close to 100=$1
[0:49:24] <$JobbedBone> 1 bit one cent
[0:49:39] <whittacre> twitch tax
[0:49:46] <cooldude69xx> So, do you think they'll do anything to Jack Blacks voice when he's bowser? I hope they do nothing at all and bowser sounds like the guy from tenacious D the whole time
[0:49:52] <$JobbedBone> ehh you just pay to get the bits into the system
[0:49:55] <+Jekado> 100 = a dollar to you but when we buy it its different
[0:50:02] <+Taglog7> I wasn't aware of this Character. Thanks, Plague.
[0:50:03] <Bucketman42> I feel it's the cost for twitch fun bucks
[0:50:07] <+Scevda> I wish these stupid points could be converted to bits for to give you.
[0:50:20] <%vizardrob> Star Lord as Mario will be fun.
[0:50:26] <SanderDCastle> I laughed histerically at that reveal
[0:50:27] <+Taglog7> It's a me, Chris Pratt
[0:50:30] <+Scevda> 7k of these things
[0:50:43] <lemoan> @plagueofgripes NONE of the cast sounds like the characters.
[0:50:48] <+Jekado> @Scevda that would be broken because i think the streamer sets the rate they are given out?
[0:50:50] <Bucketman42> The casting is some strange choices
[0:50:52] <$JobbedBone> charlie day is going to be great, hes good at stuttering
[0:50:58] <moonsaber99> I mean you would never expect cumberbatch would voice smaug
[0:51:07] <+Scevda> @jekado ah! I never realized
[0:51:10] <cooldude69xx> Joy for better or worse
[0:51:10] <SanderDCastle> Why don't they hire voice actors for the roles?
[0:51:11] <MaybeThePotato> it was some fever dream shit
[0:51:13] <+Taglog7> It was a response
[0:51:15] <smile64> i hope jack black does a dennis hopper impression
[0:51:27] <+lordericter> DK laughing with Seth Rogan's voice may cause me to puke
[0:51:29] <lemoan> @sanderdcastle literally because Hollywood
[0:51:34] <SuperVaderMan> Everyone agreed it was the worst, and because it was the worst, it was the best for some people
[0:51:41] <+Scevda> Its illumination its gonna be memes and only some good ones.
[0:51:41] <+Taglog7> He's got the Metal Chops
[0:51:49] <smile64> @SanderDCastle marketing ploy, ever since aladdin they've done this. especially after shrek
[0:51:56] <LunarRemix> They could be all humans, not CGI creatures
[0:51:59] <%silvery_cricket> Jack Black just needs to be a dick and think he is hilarious with a deep filter, and it be pretty good.
[0:52:01] <%Garrtoon> If there isn't a Neo Dino New York and a convoluted plot about fungus, count me out
[0:52:06] <%Bucketman42> Bucketman42 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:52:15] <+Taglog7> I hope Kyle get a small role
[0:52:18] <+starhammer_games> Sonic is the longest Olive Garden commercial ever
[0:52:19] <%silvery_cricket> Will Chris Pratt do a racist italian accent
[0:52:27] <%silvery_cricket> thats the real question
[0:52:32] <%Bucketman42> I brought another bucket
[0:52:38] <%silvery_cricket> MAMMA MIA THATS A SPICY MEATBALL
[0:52:39] <lemoan> @silvery_cricket boy i hope so
[0:52:41] <+Scevda> I think it only worked because sonic falls in that limbo already.
[0:52:41] <lewdnekojam> degemon emo band movie sounds like fun
[0:52:47] <$JobbedBone> theres a clip of chris pratt saying its a me mario from a long time ago
[0:52:55] <SanderDCastle> Bucketman is a hardcore The Boys type hero who crams people into his bucket
[0:53:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:53:08] <wolfen091> bucketmans secret identity is a bag salesman
[0:53:13] <jaypeesan> kinda like a babushka bucket
[0:53:14] <+legioned247> bucketman there a leak in my apartment bucketman god dam it not again
[0:53:15] <cooldude69xx> @silvery_cricket I hope he blacklists himself from the whole country by commiting too hard
[0:53:23] <SuperVaderMan> Is the bucket just Bucketman's whole costume
[0:53:35] <+Scevda> The 2 buckets guy scampering on the car is a classic vid!
[0:54:02] <LunarRemix> Even the RPGs have silly stories like that
[0:54:03] <lazylazzer> Seeing mario talk is going to be weird.
[0:54:15] <%silvery_cricket> Odyssey was about Mario and Peach's relationship being dealt with
[0:54:20] <+legioned247> does bucketman wear the bucket on his head with eyes cut out like the first iron man suit
[0:54:25] <%silvery_cricket> Mario is in love with her but she isnt interested
[0:54:42] <+Scevda> Nurse bedside manner? Im in.
[0:55:09] <SuperVaderMan> The nurse is getting ready to extract some fluids. Which ones, though, who knows
[0:55:28] <+Scevda> @supervaderman novelty sized syringe
[0:55:35] <%silvery_cricket> Milky wants to bang a Reindeer
[0:55:45] <%silvery_cricket> not a Mink but a full on reindeer
[0:55:47] <+Scevda> Ass goes here.
[0:55:48] <%silvery_cricket> isnt that wild
[0:56:18] <%silvery_cricket> Scary Milky?
[0:57:07] <lemoan> @silvery_cricket not really. chopper is still half human
[0:57:18] <SuperVaderMan> Humans have not evolved to look at each other from below
[0:57:35] <%silvery_cricket> @lemoan When he is in his hybrid form, but whehn he is in his base form he is full reindeer he just looks weird
[0:57:54] <%JailShmixRemix> double human
[0:58:13] <%silvery_cricket> As far as we know he Minks are just furry humans
[0:58:16] <+Scevda> Ascend to godhood
[0:58:30] <warandpens> The Sengoku ate a human human fruit model Buddha I believe
[0:58:33] <+chance_h> More Human than Human ~Rob Zombie
[0:58:39] <%silvery_cricket> The fruit makes you your ideal you
[0:58:40] <$JobbedBone> blossom into a beautiful butterfly
[0:58:49] <SuperVaderMan> So some animal that ate the human-human fruit in the past had A LOT of kids and started the mink civilization
[0:58:55] <+Scevda> The most complete asshole.
[0:58:55] <SuperVaderMan> of course
[0:59:15] <%silvery_cricket> Fruits can sometimes just have bad results
[0:59:18] <%silvery_cricket> and some are just bad
[0:59:18] <$JobbedBone> it reminds me of the springs from ranma LUL
[0:59:36] <+lordericter> Ono sure knows how to handle a snout
[0:59:40] <lemoan> @plagueofgripes Oda also confirmed that mink lineage is mixed. Like two deer minks can have a fox baby. Their children can be any possible mammal
[0:59:40] <LunarRemix> One Piece characters are all freaks
[0:59:44] <RiverBirch> God
[0:59:53] <+Scevda> Those arms need a sandwich or 3.
[0:59:58] <%silvery_cricket> Yeah the Minks are just furry humans
[1:00:06] <%silvery_cricket> the animal features are just facial features
[1:00:11] <RiverBirch> I feel like if I got back to watching One Piece, I'd just be swamped with a bunch of stuff to wade through
[1:00:12] <lemoan> @lunarremix yeah it's great
[1:00:36] <%silvery_cricket> I think they are rotten fruit from Idun's garden
[1:00:41] <+Scevda> Oh ya totally can happen. Dont worry that our baby came out a panda.
[1:00:52] <+Scevda> Oh ya definitely plot devices.
[1:00:54] <%silvery_cricket> but I am obsessed with One Piece being norse
[1:01:04] <%silvery_cricket> They are also rotten as fuck
[1:01:23] <+lordericter> didn't smoke man also experiment with body modification that was pretty extreme too back in Punk Hazard
[1:01:25] <%silvery_cricket> Paramecias can make you concept people
[1:01:25] <RiverBirch> Is it ever said that you need to completely eat a Devil Fruit to gain power?
[1:01:27] <Angerest> Early versions of the story had magic not fruits
[1:01:34] <Dunmarkh> Remember that a gun ate a fruit that turned the gun into a gundog???
[1:02:00] <warandpens> @Dunmarkh Bruh I forgot that. That was funny as heck lol
[1:02:09] <lemoan> @riverbirch nah. one bite eaten and it's yours.
[1:02:20] <%silvery_cricket> Now we are getting into the idea of awakening Plague, where you get a power boost when you figure out every single use of your fruit.
[1:02:31] <%silvery_cricket> So there are limited things you can do
[1:02:37] <ralphwiggum16> Sounds like a shitty writer.
[1:02:39] <RiverBirch> @lemoan Faaaiiir... subsequent question was, has anyone like, turned a devil fruit into a pie, or done cooking with them
[1:02:43] <lemoan> @dunmarkh yup. and a sword ate the elephant fruit
[1:03:02] <$JobbedBone> I like to think they're an attempt at encapsulating pure essences or Forms ala Plato
[1:03:10] <warandpens> Oda is tricky cause he is super detailed while also not caring about some other aspects
[1:03:22] <flangodferny> Hey Plague, just dropping by to say hello. Have a nice day.
[1:03:26] <SuperVaderMan> Just don't think 4Head
[1:03:29] <%silvery_cricket> I think Wano is on the back of a whale
[1:03:29] <+Scevda> Some people see it as narrative “meta gaming”. They dont like that.
[1:03:32] <flangodferny> Also don't forget to not care what people think
[1:03:39] <%silvery_cricket> and there are some people that do not like that
[1:03:49] <%vizardrob> is it like the Broodwich?
[1:03:49] <lemoan> @supervaderman nah that's the fun of eat
[1:03:56] <%silvery_cricket> You can cook them it doesnt matter
[1:04:03] <%silvery_cricket> one bite and its yours
[1:04:05] <%silvery_cricket> and no one elses
[1:04:16] <+chance_h> What happens if you make the fruit into a fruit salad?
[1:04:30] <Danroy230230> ^ then it tastes better
[1:04:33] <%silvery_cricket> @chance_h If you eat a part of the Devil Fruit its yours
[1:04:37] <%silvery_cricket> and yours alone
[1:04:52] <lemoan> @danroy230230 nah apparently the fruit taste like shit
[1:05:00] <%silvery_cricket> @lemoan tastes like rotted fruit
[1:05:06] <Danroy230230> i know
[1:05:19] <ralphwiggum16> I believe in time travel.
[1:05:19] <%silvery_cricket> Time travel does exist in One Piece
[1:05:24] <%silvery_cricket> but you can only go forward
[1:05:28] <Danroy230230> watch the one piece be the devil fruit of friendship
[1:05:30] <+MightyDuckShoes> I think it's money.
[1:05:30] <%silvery_cricket> AS FAR AS WE KNOW
[1:05:47] <+Scevda> @mightyduckshoes one can hope.
[1:05:49] <SanderDCastle> Oda only needs to introduce a fruit that does the same as Toki's but in reverse, and we have time travel
[1:05:54] <Tracazoid> Frankenstein
[1:06:05] <ralphwiggum16> Boris Karloff made a great movie called Targets
[1:06:14] <%silvery_cricket> Is this the recruit Paige into One Piece plan?
[1:06:17] <whittacre> Wa Wa
[1:06:20] <%EyeFarted> I thought Zentreya had a dragon ass...

[1:06:58] <RiverBirch> A Paige is never late.
[1:07:05] <%silvery_cricket> Paige would love Brook he makes Papyrus looks like a D list skeleton
[1:07:10] <LunarRemix> She sounds fine on the stream
[1:07:26] <+Scevda> Shes fine on my end as well.
[1:07:37] <+MightyDuckShoes> Paige can do her Pirates of the Caribbean song
[1:07:37] <%silvery_cricket> PAIGE IS IN THE WALLS

[1:10:37] <%silvery_cricket> sounds like Paige needs to read One Piece
[1:10:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> Isn't it basically waterworld?
[1:10:41] <lemoan> @joviangargoyle woof
[1:10:51] <$JobbedBone> HahaShrugLeft PokChandelure HahaShrugRight its a mystery
[1:10:53] <%sparklinghallow> lol, that's more than what I know about it

[1:10:57] <+MightyDuckShoes> Don't give it up, Nami!
[1:11:10] <lewdnekojam> its basicly the philpinese
[1:11:14] <+MightyDuckShoes> Don't give it up, Zoro!
[1:11:39] <%silvery_cricket> BECAUSE THATS ILLEGAL PAIGE
[1:11:42] <RiverBirch> Think, Great Library of Alexandria x1 million
[1:11:43] <%silvery_cricket> REMEMBERING IS A CRIME
[1:11:46] <+MightyDuckShoes> They killed History with a gun
[1:11:50] <TIME_PUNCHER> One Piece is Adventure Time?
[1:12:00] <%silvery_cricket> @TIME_PUNCHER Kinda but on water
[1:12:02] <Angerest> 800 years ago
[1:12:10] <+legioned247> history lives forever
[1:12:12] <+lordericter> the powers are anything basically
[1:12:13] <+Scevda> in a land comprised of mostly water
[1:12:22] <jaypeesan> Loosing an ability I never had in the first place..ok...I am a pirate too then
[1:12:25] <Danroy230230> ability of spring
[1:12:27] <Snookasaurus> he can drown but he can run on  water
[1:12:34] <Dunmarkh> He still can't swim, but most skeletons can't so it's fine
[1:12:38] <$JobbedBone> Megaman Legends worldbuilding made a big deal about how little land there is but you never get a good depiction of it
[1:12:39] <%silvery_cricket> Yes Brook can kiss
[1:12:40] <LVL1_Scumbag> He can bump teeth I guess
[1:12:42] <+legioned247> history lives in the present to attack the future
[1:12:43] <+lordericter> he can still do the most important thing Paige, poop
[1:12:43] <$saw6boy> not exactly that they cant swim its just that water drains their stamina
[1:12:51] <lemoan> sure paige
[1:12:57] <lewdnekojam> his superpower is to be a Halloween dacoration
[1:13:00] <lemoan> he can try paige

[1:13:06] <lemoan> he rubber
[1:13:06] <+lordericter> he's a rubber boy
[1:13:16] <+lordericter> he's more like Elastic Man
[1:13:20] <Dunmarkh> more like plastic man
[1:13:23] <+Scevda> Luffie lol
[1:13:36] <%silvery_cricket> Luffy is a stretch armstrong
[1:13:36] <whittacre> just a regular human

[1:15:11] <RiverBirch> Hockey!
[1:15:12] <RiverBirch> :D
[1:15:18] <%silvery_cricket> Think of it like Ki from Dragon Ball
[1:15:24] <lemoan> @riverbirch Haki
[1:15:27] <+Scevda> How is it spelled?
[1:15:32] <+Scevda> Oh haki?

[1:15:48] <%silvery_cricket> its called the Ox Ox No Mi Horse Model
[1:15:49] <+Scevda> I would like the Colorado Avalanche haki.

[1:15:53] <warandpens> Luffy can actually make his dickus bigger with Gear 3rd. Oda confirmed it
[1:15:54] <RiverBirch> @lemoan Yeah, Hockey
[1:15:54] <whittacre> you can't share
[1:16:02] <$JobbedBone> its an atomic operation
[1:16:12] <%silvery_cricket> You explode
[1:16:31] <Dunmarkh> The knife might get the power
[1:16:39] <SanderDCastle> no no, you can cut them
[1:16:48] <%vizardrob> didn't long nose from cp9 cut his banana fruit and eat it with a fork? from water 7
[1:16:54] <SanderDCastle> Kaku frombthe cp9 cut and ate his
[1:16:55] <Dunmarkh> @SanderDCastle what about the sword that ate a fruit
[1:17:05] <warandpens> Remember guys, Kaku cut his devil fruit with a knife and ate it with a fork
[1:17:07] <+lordericter> I think that's how blackbeard got his power yeah
[1:17:10] <SanderDCastle> we don't know that yet
[1:17:11] <%JailShmixRemix> I dont believe its ever questioned
[1:17:20] <+Mailboy> kalifa cut into hers

[1:17:30] <%silvery_cricket> any fruit
[1:17:33] <%Artista_AF> Devil's Ketchup
[1:17:34] <+Scevda> The blade of the knife wins.
[1:17:34] <SanderDCastle> yess
[1:17:34] <%KELTHUZAD9999> if cut it still is the one who eat it first who gets the power
[1:17:43] <%silvery_cricket> Tomatos are fruit
[1:17:46] <Dunmarkh> A gun ate a fruit.
[1:17:49] <Rhetco> corn is my favourite fruit
[1:17:50] <whittacre> vegetables are just a plant that you eat
[1:17:57] <Angerest> First come, first served no matter how you dice it
[1:17:57] <+Scevda> Nightshades ahoy.
[1:17:58] <Rhetco> root tubers
[1:18:00] <%Bigchill___> Tubars?
[1:18:14] <whittacre> potatos are tubers, carrots are taproots
[1:18:15] <Snookasaurus> rootfruit

[2:21:01] <$JobbedBone> meant the "royal" form of you, but yeah LUL most of it is grosser than that. Ticks are arachnids
[2:21:03] <RickyRelucent> NotLikeThis
[2:21:08] <+lordericter> she probably just tongued some balls on a guy who wipes wrong
[2:21:09] <%Bigchill___> was it called Mountain Doo back in the day?
[2:21:19] <+Heart0fInk> two doctors one cup
[2:21:19] <MarylandJutsu> Is having a conversation with Paige usually like talking to a 10 yo Plague?
[2:21:20] <generalve> "FREAKY" LUL
[2:21:22] <%vizardrob> good stream y'all
[2:21:30] <eyeobject> I injected her with a liter of cocaine and now her feet work

[2:21:34] <generalve> hahahahaah
[2:21:40] <%EyeFarted> EATIN ASS IS SECOND BASE TO ME
[2:21:40] <%lemoan> @lordericter the idea of "wiping wrong" is somehow very stupid funny to me
[2:21:54] <%Explodincatz> what even is 3rd base?
[2:21:58] <Angerest> shes 3 10 year olds
[2:22:09] <MarylandJutsu> in a trenchcoat?
[2:22:13] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Drawing a Mink, huh
[2:22:14] <lewdnekojam> dont forget the crunch corn drops
[2:22:14] <atgithursdays> down to the ROOT
[2:22:15] <generalve> Kappa
[2:22:17] <%SoFarFetched> Is this what they mean by 'talk dirty to me?"
[2:22:20] <$JobbedBone> Children would have large groups of friends, physically play with each-other all day long, and obviously not wash their hands much, its not hard to see how it spread back then
[2:22:21] <%lemoan> AAAAAAAHHHHH Eli that was so bad lol
[2:22:36] <+lordericter> @lemoan I mean back then you'd be lucky if they gave it more than one pass with a leaf
[2:22:37] <generalve> that's fucking insane
[2:22:43] <$JobbedBone> ye
[2:22:44] <JovianGargoyle> She'll become a spinal fluid vampire.
[2:22:46] <+lordericter> or some news print
[2:22:49] <RickyRelucent> grinding down teeth for calcium
[2:22:53] <$JobbedBone> yes it destroys parts of your body
[2:22:53] <+Heart0fInk> @Angerest 3 10 years olds in a big person costume
[2:23:00] <generalve> polo sucks by the way
[2:23:03] <MarylandJutsu> Does she become Mobius but with spinal fluid instead of PLASMA
[2:23:06] <eyeobject> They discovered that communism caused polio
[2:23:10] <generalve> being inside a tube for all your life.....
[2:23:11] <+lordericter> maybe in India
[2:23:15] <+Scevda> Drink clean water you fucks!
[2:23:15] <%Explodincatz> polo does suck yea

[2:23:22] <Angerest> @Heart0fInk well she says shes tall
[2:23:23] <JovianGargoyle> Oh, yeah. There's an ape.
[2:23:23] <%lemoan> THESE KIDS GOT GUNS
[2:23:24] <+Heart0fInk> Anti vaxx kids probably
[2:23:29] <%SoFarFetched> Im still thinking about that time my state had a measles outbrain on the train geefBruh
[2:23:32] <SoFarFetched> outbreak*
[2:23:40] <+Reverend_Roscoe> it's the suburban sasquatch!
[2:23:40] <Vulgar_Prophet> Fucking kids. Poor Harambe.
[2:23:44] <RickyRelucent> drinking bottled water is nothing when you have to pass shitcreeks when you exit your domicile
[2:23:47] <+Reverend_Roscoe> RUHR RUHR
[2:23:55] <nip_nips> cant trust those people in polioville
[2:23:59] <generalve> I prefer ass eating at Madden Town Kappa
[2:24:24] <MarylandJutsu> wow look at this very caucasian town
[2:24:24] <%lemoan> Wait wait wait. Did the doctor just let the gorilla go?
[2:24:37] <%Explodincatz> bang bang
[2:24:45] <generalve> I DID NOTTTTTT
[2:24:46] <%lemoan> @MarylandJutsu and the only black man was in a circus off
[2:24:50] <RickyRelucent> im from yonkers
[2:24:50] <Vulgar_Prophet> Dont "Ape me" at home, ma!
[2:24:51] <Sphincter_Spelunker> isn't a .22 a varmint rifle? how'd you kill an ape with that
[2:24:55] <MarylandJutsu> why are they fine with these children having a GONE
[2:24:56] <MarylandJutsu> GUN
[2:24:56] <%EyeFarted> i can't stand kids
[2:25:04] <generalve> that kid is like 19 acting like a 10 year old
[2:25:05] <MarylandJutsu> @lemoan sighhhh of coures
[2:25:09] <+Heart0fInk> They shot a cow? What?
[2:25:12] <MarylandJutsu> I hope that ape beats up the kids
[2:25:15] <%lemoan> @MarylandJutsu I think those are bebe guns
[2:25:16] <+lordericter> that ape just cannot escape
[2:25:20] <MarylandJutsu> oh ok
[2:25:23] <MarylandJutsu> so its fine
[2:25:26] <eyeobject> We're eating ape steak tonight boys!
[2:25:27] <RickyRelucent> the ape costume looks good
[2:25:28] <%EyeFarted> That ape just wanted to eat ass like the rest of us...
[2:25:44] <%Murphio_GS> It's not a bad assumption
[2:25:54] <Angerest> its our primal urge to poke a monkey with a stick
[2:25:56] <MarylandJutsu> the ape is a were ape that lives on spinal fluid
[2:26:02] <MarylandJutsu> and ass
[2:26:12] <+Scevda> Those kids must be REALLY fucking stupid
[2:26:14] <+lordericter> a .22 is a very low cal gun yeah, generally the biggest thing you can kill with it is a person.  Most large animals will only get injured.
[2:26:23] <MarylandJutsu> @Scevda so just kids then
[2:26:26] <%EyeFarted> "sniffin ape"
[2:26:37] <+Heart0fInk> did you know most zoo's have a "Kill on sight" policy for Chimps if they escape? Not for lions tigers or bear or even gorillas. but for chimps.
[2:26:47] <MarylandJutsu> Id be done with all this. all these white people, apes
[2:27:06] <%Murphio_GS> Never be old
[2:27:12] <+Scevda> Your vr rig also looks done with it.
[2:27:14] <%lemoan> @Heart0fInk not an excuse but chimps probably carry a lot more dieseases
[2:27:29] <eyeobject> Paige is going to end up as a head in a jar
[2:27:35] <MarylandJutsu> don't tell anyone, my fragile masculinity couldn't handled being called a chicken
[2:27:48] <+Heart0fInk> @lemoan It's because chimps are fuckin murder hungry psychos
[2:28:00] <IrishWeegee> ew no
[2:28:03] <MarylandJutsu> Paige.....no
[2:28:03] <Sphincter_Spelunker> it's in the lungs, Paige
[2:28:14] <nip_nips> is paige worried about catching it from pat that way?
[2:28:21] <lewdnekojam> one way to find out
[2:28:22] <%lemoan> @Heart0fInk oh yeah that too. Chimapnzee are fucked. Not far off from primal children
[2:28:23] <$JobbedBone> chimps are strong and curious
[2:28:27] <+Scevda> No it doesn’t survive the gestation tract paige.
[2:28:29] <Samex_Comex> You can still have your fart parties
[2:28:34] <MarylandJutsu> Scientific expert Peach Salivia
[2:28:36] <$JobbedBone> like 10x the strength of a person iirc
[2:28:36] <MarylandJutsu> back at it
[2:28:41] <eyeobject> Can I get covid from eating ass?
[2:28:42] <RickyRelucent> pinkeye and covid in one shot just fart on their pillow
[2:28:43] <Vulgar_Prophet> Are people farting in public without pants?
[2:28:47] <%Bigchill___> doing your facebook 'research'
[2:28:49] <+Heart0fInk> You dingle honey
[2:29:01] <generalve> paige could totally rock that hair style
[2:29:14] <nip_nips> the power of fart
[2:29:23] <+Heart0fInk> Are farts contagious?
[2:29:27] <+Lobsterdinner> Just tuned in to a PlagueofGripes stream, Peach asks a question about disease transmission via flatulence. Glad I wasn't too late.
[2:29:28] <+Scevda> How about overalls?
[2:29:33] <generalve> Jesus Christ calm the fuck down old man
[2:29:36] <%Murphio_GS> now move it move it
[2:29:40] <kirijotakeharu> shit, are you telling me I gotta mask up over my face AND my asshole?
[2:29:42] <%lemoan> This fucking ape has only been in this movie for about 15% of it
[2:29:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> Walk damn you!
[2:29:48] <RiverBirch> RACE ME AROUND THE LIBRARY
[2:29:53] <%Explodincatz> are they trying to get this cripple to walk thru spiral power?
[2:29:53] <generalve> DUCK THIS OLD GUY

[2:29:55] <Samex_Comex> Move you dumb ass eater!
[2:30:01] <MarylandJutsu> INJECT SPINAL FLUID RIGHT INTO THE VEINS
[2:30:04] <+lordericter> Danny
[2:30:05] <%Murphio_GS> MOAWRR
[2:30:06] <Julkson> When did this movie called The Ape stopped being about The Ape?
[2:30:07] <+lordericter> is his name
[2:30:08] <$JobbedBone> plenty of people who don't care if it works and just wear it so they don't get hassled
[2:30:10] <RickyRelucent> co2 filters for your asshole
[2:30:11] <Vulgar_Prophet> They need to play that girl some krunk music.
[2:30:15] <+Scevda> MOAR
[2:30:16] <RickyRelucent> just insert it like a spiral
[2:30:18] <generalve> hahahahah
[2:30:22] <nip_nips> shes trying to spread her polio
[2:30:47] <Sphincter_Spelunker> atpCap
[2:30:51] <MarylandJutsu> PAIGE
[2:31:01] <MarylandJutsu> your search history is forever
[2:31:04] <Vulgar_Prophet> Eating Ass is....pretty godamn classic.
[2:31:05] <%SoFarFetched> "WHEN DID MAN EAT ASS"
[2:31:06] <$JobbedBone> "the history of analingus"
[2:31:09] <generalve> they had no baby wipes back than by the way WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2:31:10] <silverpoyozo> It was a health fad probably
[2:31:12] <nip_nips> "when did they invent eating ass"
[2:31:13] <+Heart0fInk> who was the first human to eat ass?
[2:31:17] <%EyeFarted> Adam ate Eve's ass
[2:31:18] <Sphincter_Spelunker> PAIGE
[2:31:20] <kirijotakeharu> Hey Google, who was the first person to eat ass?
[2:31:27] <$JobbedBone> THE JAMES JOYCE LETTERS LUL
[2:31:28] <nip_nips> he sure did
[2:31:28] <%Murphio_GS> Mozart is a sigma male
[2:31:43] <+Scevda> It is definitely more a modern development because of sanitation conditions.
[2:31:46] <impulse255dj> @JobbedBone YES!!!!
[2:31:46] <+Heart0fInk> @EyeFarted That was the forbidden fruit of knowledge.
[2:31:50] <generalve> think meryall hate Johnny ass  ?
[2:31:54] <MarylandJutsu> Paige, I know back in the Restoration period, there was a musical/play about dildos
[2:31:57] <+flechet> Thomas jefferson LOVED farts
[2:32:00] <Vulgar_Prophet> All artist's are broken inside.
[2:32:15] <%Murphio_GS> have it squirt
[2:32:25] <generalve> Im pretty sure what William Shakespeare made tossing salad jokes back than
[2:32:32] <%Murphio_GS> Eirsh
[2:32:37] <+Heart0fInk> @Vulgar_Prophet you could have stopped at broken..
[2:32:55] <eyeobject> Eating ass was invented by Colonel Angus Buttmunch during the war of 1812
[2:32:57] <+Scevda> Paige Joyce
[2:33:07] <+flechet> ALSO you could pay for a LARGE selection of fart based services at brothels
[2:33:37] <+Heart0fInk> They're M'lady-ing all over the place.
[2:33:47] <%Bigchill___> back in them days, you wore your hat when you went outisde
[2:33:47] <%lemoan> damn that man was short
[2:33:48] <$JobbedBone> apparently there is pottery of hetero eating ass from 1000 CE
[2:33:50] <Vulgar_Prophet> Plague, you might try a Panama style hat. Might suit you.
[2:34:03] <+Scevda> Balding was still a thing to “hide” back then i guess
[2:34:04] <Sphincter_Spelunker> streamuh
[2:34:05] <Vulgar_Prophet> She wanted to know if his dad ate ass.

[2:34:23] <JovianGargoyle> Yes
[2:34:27] <eyeobject> We're talking about eating assuh
[2:34:29] <kirijotakeharu> I believe it was JFL who popularized not wearing hats, he didn't like em so people followed suit
[2:34:29] <RickyRelucent> poor pat
[2:34:35] <Skatedeandre> yeah excruciatingly so
[2:34:41] <kirijotakeharu> *JFK
[2:34:44] <%lemoan> I don't know about pat's dick problems
[2:34:49] <+Scevda> And ass problems.
[2:35:04] <Samex_Comex> I hope the ape wins
[2:35:24] <%lemoan> @Samex_Comex the ape might as well not even exist in this movie anymore
[2:35:29] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> in the end, humans were the real apes all along
[2:35:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> LuvPeekR
[2:35:38] <+Heart0fInk> APE CRIMES!

[2:37:59] <RickyRelucent> and stumbling
[2:38:01] <+Reyvierno> Will the ape force itself upon the paralyzed woman? The chances are higher than you'd like.
[2:38:06] <jaypeesan> they were pretty racist agains ape people back then
[2:38:12] <el_r0berto> "can an apex defeat a paralyzed woman" is plague describing the movie or Paige & pat?
[2:38:22] <eyeobject> To be fair, Pat is perfect ass eating height
[2:38:24] <+Lobsterdinner> They're going to open the door and the ape is drinking liquor to dull the pain
[2:38:27] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> ape down! ape down!

[2:44:32] <+Heart0fInk> That... doesn't work..
[2:44:33] <silverpoyozo> it runs in the genes
[2:44:36] <tanarath> Pat's family is a bunch of winos.
[2:44:46] <eyeobject> Pat and his dad are bred to be perfect ass eating height
[2:44:50] <+RealThiele> hes more likely to be short cause his mom drank
[2:44:59] <+Scevda> Pat is now genetically predisposed to being ass eating height.
[2:45:16] <lewdnekojam> lol
[2:45:16] <+lordericter> holy shit Plague
[2:45:17] <+Lobsterdinner> Perfected evolution for ass eating
[2:45:19] <%SoFarFetched> PAIGE IS KISSING A POO MAN
[2:45:20] <Dunmarkh> WutFace
[2:45:22] <%SoFarFetched> geefGasp
[2:45:24] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> so he claims that polio genetically altered his dad enough to pass on shortness?
[2:45:24] <RickyRelucent> perfect
[2:45:28] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Lobsterdinner by the by, milk chocolate is like 40% chocolate. actual chocolate isn't sweet at all
[2:45:35] <+RealThiele> @Sebbers_and_Eggs somehow, yes
[2:45:41] <RickyRelucent> Tbh i wouldn't even be into it
[2:45:52] <%SoFarFetched> Its one way to get your salad paige......a "tossed salad" if you will geefPlz
[2:45:54] <Samex_Comex> If he can eat ass then he can eat my bad food
[2:45:55] <+Heart0fInk> he participated in a cow pie eating contest.
[2:45:58] <eyeobject> If you eat ass, do you talk shit?
[2:46:00] <tanarath> Everyone g
[2:46:00] <+rdark_ksu> Sense of superiority?
[2:46:01] <+Lobsterdinner> @Sphincter_Spelunker I buy a different % every time just try new stuff! Not in order though, stupidly enough.
[2:46:13] <+Jekado> @SoFarFetched are you saying eating ass is Vegan?
[2:46:15] <Skatedeandre> EWWW
[2:46:15] <+buff_shiba> I came in at science should eliminate buttholes. Not even surprised.
[2:46:15] <tanarath> Everyone has a butthole, Paige.
[2:46:19] <+Scevda> *Pat liked that*
[2:46:19] <Sergiroth> 100% energy efficiency.
[2:46:21] <RickyRelucent> it happened
[2:46:28] <Skatedeandre> oh its ok
[2:46:32] <RickyRelucent> its not for my enjoyment either
[2:46:34] <%SoFarFetched> DID JESUS EAT THE FIRST ASS OF MAN?
[2:46:37] <+RealThiele> poophole loophole tho
[2:46:38] <%Murphio_GS> Jesus never signed off on eating ass
[2:46:44] <+Heart0fInk> She had a broken ass Paige!
[2:46:49] <+Heart0fInk> it wasn't fine
[2:46:54] <Skatedeandre> hopefully nothing
[2:46:54] <+lordericter> no
[2:46:55] <+Lobsterdinner> It doesn't say anything about NOT-eating ass.
[2:46:55] <Chartalord> Jesus was a big fan of eating ass
[2:46:56] <+DeaconBluesClues> @tanarath my dad used to say "see a pretty girl? she probably has a pound of shit inside her at any given time"
[2:46:57] <%EyeFarted> unused butthole, $500 or best offer
[2:46:58] <tanarath> Is that Paige?
[2:46:59] <%SoFarFetched> remember loopholes
[2:47:03] <el_r0berto> if Jesus didn't want us to eat ass he shouldn't have made them so tasty
[2:47:04] <PlebianNoob> Do you think Jesus was an Ass guy or a tits guy?
[2:47:06] <RickyRelucent> does it limit itself to just sex for procreation
[2:47:06] <Angerest> Get SALTED
[2:47:06] <%Murphio_GS> Homeysexuality
[2:47:06] <Sphincter_Spelunker> ask the priests
[2:47:08] <+RealThiele> John 420:69 : Eat ass every day
[2:47:09] <RickyRelucent> bjs allowed
[2:47:11] <$JobbedBone> epigenetic causes are rare, one of the only known cases was when there was a famine in the netherlands caused the next generation of kids to have increased rates of obesity
[2:47:13] <someweirdo227> Numbers almost definitely has some words on eating ass
[2:47:13] <RickyRelucent> eating ass allowed
[2:47:16] <Skatedeandre> homiesexual
[2:47:19] <eyeobject> And the Lord said, "Eat of my ass."
[2:47:22] <+Scevda> Probably included sodomy.
[2:47:22] <%Bigchill___> things were translated poorly from the bible
[2:47:23] <RickyRelucent> and its not like you'd have sex once
[2:47:24] <RickyRelucent> and stop
[2:47:27] <%SoFarFetched> give my homeys a kiss goodnight......in the asshole
[2:47:29] <RickyRelucent> so there'd be people around
[2:47:29] <JonnyJug> Get deep into the homeyhole
[2:47:32] <+Heart0fInk> Homogenizedsexual
[2:47:44] <Seth_Tek> All my homies love goodnight kisses!
[2:47:44] <+Reyvierno> Everyone was homiesexual back then
[2:47:45] <+Sebbers_and_Eggs> just guys helping each other out
[2:47:47] <+RealThiele> you eat his body just eat it ass first
[2:47:48] <%SoFarFetched> Jesus sacrificed himself to eat ass.
[2:47:49] <+Lobsterdinner> If it has chocolate filling yes
[2:47:50] <$JobbedBone> Theres a lot of ass eating in middle age folios, but its mostly comical in nature.
[2:47:57] <jaypeesan> the bread comes out of his ass
[2:48:02] <eyeobject> the ass part is a donut
[2:48:04] <%EyeFarted> THIS BAGEL IS MY BUTTHOLE
[2:48:04] <%Explodincatz> the ass was the first thing he gave
[2:48:09] <+Reyvierno> People eating Jesus' ass every Sunday at church
[2:48:10] <RickyRelucent> maybe he just had bread
[2:48:11] <Sphincter_Spelunker> if he's so great why's he dead
[2:48:15] <%Murphio_GS> He was betrayed by Judas, and when he was on the cross, he saw him with a legionnaire and cried a tear
[2:48:17] <RickyRelucent> and said some shit
[2:48:23] <+Heart0fInk> Gods always listening so ask him
[2:48:24] <RickyRelucent> BUT NO HE LITERALLYY
[2:48:29] <IrishWeegee> mmMMM good cookin
[2:48:30] <%SoFarFetched> Paige would ask Jesus if it was okay to fuck skeletons
[2:48:32] <%EyeFarted> IT'S NICE AND CHEWY
[2:48:34] <Angerest> and Polio
[2:48:40] <$JobbedBone> kissing an ass also had a loose connection with satanic influence, such that there are depictions of witches kissing satan's ass to seal the deal
[2:48:46] <%Murphio_GS> Bluud
[2:48:49] <+Lobsterdinner> You mean grape juice <:c
[2:48:51] <%lemoan> IT'S BLUUUUUUDDDD
[2:48:51] <Samex_Comex> Mmm blood
[2:48:54] <+rdark_ksu> Fun fact in Catholicism the change from bread to Jesus is called transubstantiation.
[2:48:59] <+DeaconBluesClues> @plagueofgripes didn't Martin Luther and Zwingli have a horrible falling out over this exact theological debate
[2:49:24] <%Badpest> wait so which part of the bread is the ass?
[2:49:26] <Angerest> Kermit wot
[2:49:29] <+RealThiele> The X are the crazy ones
[2:49:39] <%lemoan> @Badpest the whole bread
[2:49:40] <+Scevda> Gotta talk like kermit the frog.
[2:49:40] <Sphincter_Spelunker> holding sweating hands
[2:49:41] <IrishWeegee> LUL
[2:49:43] <%Murphio_GS> Paige did your priests speak latin for church?
[2:49:48] <someweirdo227> To be fair, every domination that isn't Catholic says the Catholics are the crazy ones.
[2:49:50] <+Lobsterdinner> Catholics have those stale chip things, other religions have better bread imo
[2:49:50] <+Scevda> Ceremony does make it better yet.
[2:49:53] <PlebianNoob> You have to be fit to go to a catholic mass
[2:50:01] <kirijotakeharu> LMAO
[2:50:07] <jaypeesan> how do u say ass in latin?
[2:50:09] <+Heart0fInk> Fun Fact! All variants of Christians are the crazy ones. I can say that because i used to be one..
[2:50:17] <eyeobject> I was an altar boy growing up. It really messed up my knees but my tonsils are worse.
[2:50:19] <+RealThiele> jesus, man that certainly knew latin and not hebrew or Aramaic
[2:50:20] <Angerest> Latin is OG muppet tounge
[2:50:22] <DaoistNeko> "its good for exercise" also page "you sit and you stand"
[2:50:23] <IrishWeegee> thats how they do it
[2:50:25] <%lemoan> @jaypeesan booty duh
[2:50:25] <Sphincter_Spelunker> ???
[2:50:35] <JonnyJug> Jesus did say if someone slaps you on your right cheek, you should turn them the other cheek as well
[2:50:35] <+Lobsterdinner> BECAUSE PLAGUE Kermit is an ordained Catholic Priest!
[2:50:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> THATS NOT HOW THEY DO IT PAIGE
[2:50:40] <%Murphio_GS> Jesus likely knew Hebrew and/or Aramaic
[2:50:43] <eyeobject> can confirm
[2:50:44] <%Murphio_GS> for sure
[2:50:46] <+Scevda> So how about dem Mormons!
[2:50:47] <Samex_Comex> Paige's church was just muppets
[2:50:47] <someweirdo227> Went to Catholic school, can confirm
[2:50:54] <%Bluwizard21> it is a norm for speaking in latin for seme reason
[2:50:55] <$JobbedBone> AngelThump do ri me voice
[2:50:55] <PlebianNoob> I want to disagree but she is not wrong
[2:50:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> mid west catholics atpCap

[3:30:44] <%Heart0fInk> Don't diddle the corpse
[3:30:50] <%silvery_cricket> @Julkson That dirty filthy perverted thieving drunk Romani is basically black by 50s standards
[3:30:51] <RickyRelucent> I wonder what year this movie, is from
[3:30:52] <+Scevda> Some view italians and irish as non-whites for some reason.
[3:31:06] <%Bigchill___> good job chat, you picked a good one
[3:31:12] <+RealThiele> gotta find that other to blame for your problems
[3:31:34] <%Explodincatz> scapegoating is fun

[3:31:54] <RickyRelucent> solid people, i know they come from here
[3:31:56] <%Murphio_GS> It's an older way of looking at things @Scevda , used to be that only anglo-saxons were true whites back before the revolutionary war. At the time they even considered germans as swarthy
[3:32:13] <RickyRelucent> italians i guess did have some fluctuations
[3:32:19] <+Scevda> Catapult woot.
[3:32:31] <JoshManVGH> They just pushed the whole damn thing into the lake!? For real?!
[3:32:53] <%silvery_cricket> Okay thats now how that worked

[3:33:25] <RickyRelucent> rather then over discriptive
[3:33:27] <%silvery_cricket> they had you give up shit that took up to much land and property
[3:33:41] <%silvery_cricket> so if you had endless fields you owned and did nothing with they reclaimed that land

[3:33:50] <+RealThiele> booo

[3:53:57] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Explodincatz they reversed the footage and used string
[3:53:58] <nip_nips> it was shot in reverse and they used a giant magnet to pull the sickle away, duh

[3:55:47] <JoshManVGH> @silvery_cricket That makes sense, but it looks so goofy

[4:19:27] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @HarryMasonSM I'm a speed typer on my laptop keyboard! ;)
[4:19:29] <%Heart0fInk> I agree that the FF7R was BORING
[4:19:39] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> I can type 55-70 WPM.
[4:19:42] <cap_bon> I dont think its controversial to say remakes time ghosts read like fanfiction LUL
[4:19:51] <%Murphio_GS> the voice acting does him justice I guess
[4:20:03] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Whatcha drawing?
[4:20:07] <nip_nips> shera
[4:20:12] <%Murphio_GS> Shebeast
[4:20:14] <lewdnekojam> her name was steve
[4:20:31] <nip_nips> he just wants you to sit down and drink your tea
[4:20:37] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Then Palmer gets Indiana Jones'd
[4:20:49] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Hey, Plague. Nice Fedora.
[4:21:07] <RickyRelucent> the fedora comes with a chinstrap
[4:21:18] <%Murphio_GS> It's a farmer's cap
[4:21:19] <%lemoan> @Bowler_Hat_Gamer It's a farmer hat. Also he's drawing Tristan from One Piece
[4:21:22] <+Ghostbuster216> Bucket hat.
[4:21:26] <RickyRelucent> its a trilby
[4:21:29] <eyeobject> bucket hat?
[4:21:31] <Sphincter_Spelunker> def not a bucket hat
[4:21:33] <marklarphd> I would call it a sun hat
[4:21:35] <HarryMasonSM> I call it. A hat!
[4:21:35] <Dunmarkh> Outback hat
[4:21:36] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Oh okay.
[4:21:36] <tanarath> b::
[4:21:39] <RickyRelucent> funnily enough the hat they call fedora
[4:21:41] <Dunmarkh> mountie hat
[4:21:41] <RickyRelucent> is a trillby
[4:21:41] <$JobbedBone> its a festival hat
[4:21:51] <%Gmanblue> @Garrtoon Thanks for the gift sub!
[4:21:57] <eyeobject> Plague is my favorite cat in a hat
[4:21:58] <%Murphio_GS> People are stupid and are ignorant of hat
[4:22:03] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> I mean, it resembles Freddy Krueger's hat minus the chinstrap.
[4:22:03] <That_Taxman> People just don't appreciate a good hat.
[4:22:07] <%Bigchill___> I wear a cabbie hat
[4:22:16] <+Ghostbuster216> @That_Taxman Agreed 100%.
[4:22:17] <+Scevda> Mr bucket hat.
[4:22:21] <+Scevda> There is?!
[4:22:21] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @That_Taxman I can attest to that. Good thing I wear a bowler! ;)
[4:22:22] <%Garrtoon> @Gmanblue Got ya boss
[4:22:32] <+DeaconBluesClues> the loss of hats is all JFKs fault @plagueofgripes he was the first president to forgo dress hats
[4:22:53] <%Heart0fInk> Hat reveal!
[4:22:54] <eyeobject> show hat
[4:23:00] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Plague, someone pointed out the syringe shouldn't be full if the plunger is pushed down :)
[4:23:02] <RickyRelucent> the only hat paige would look good in is a cowboy hat
[4:23:08] <+Scevda> ~meeeeeeee~
[4:23:08] <%Explodincatz> hats are dead cause baldies no longer feel shame
[4:23:14] <lewdnekojam> next movie!
[4:23:14] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Is the syringe full of Covid vaccine?
[4:23:25] <%traximus_s> plagueGripes
[4:23:30] <%Explodincatz> no its full of Polio
[4:23:38] <That_Taxman> @Bowler_Hat_Gamer High or low crown bowler?
[4:23:41] <%Murphio_GS> Polio flavored icecream
[4:23:46] <RickyRelucent> uncy plague is making gelatto
[4:23:49] <wolfen091> and then yall were in the mafia
[4:23:51] <nip_nips> what a nerd doing things right
[4:24:02] <+DeaconBluesClues> @plagueofgripes did you guys check out beastars season 2
[4:24:10] <cap_bon> thing? you mean the needle
[4:24:16] <RickyRelucent> food isn't right when it doesn't take days to make
[4:24:17] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @That_Taxman I believe it's a low crown. You'll need to see me wearing it on my stream to confirm.
[4:24:20] <%Heart0fInk> That needle goes right up the pee hole
[4:24:26] <RickyRelucent> carbonade, spaghetti sauce
[4:24:33] <RickyRelucent> some just freeze beautifully
[4:24:34] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @That_Taxman But you can also check my archives since it shows me wearing it. :)
[4:24:44] <lewdnekojam> chad move
[4:24:49] <%Murphio_GS> that's the attitude of the artist
[4:24:52] <cap_bon> "You draw? can you draw me" tomatoSmile
[4:24:56] <That_Taxman> @Bowler_Hat_Gamer Will take a lurk.
[4:25:09] <+Scevda> You did.
[4:25:10] <%Murphio_GS> We devalue our drawings and our own work
[4:25:15] <%Heart0fInk> you were drawing a DBZ character in a jacket
[4:25:17] <%waffle_stache> The Drafting Peaches video?
[4:25:19] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @That_Taxman Thanks! :) Be sure to follow if you like what you see. :)
[4:25:20] <Quiet__Viking> I drew kakashi once in school and wrote Goku on it and some guy got mad at me
[4:25:21] <marklarphd> Writing for the trash bin
[4:25:24] <HarryMasonSM> Thats true.
[4:25:33] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @Quiet__Viking Anime fans are like that, sadly.
[4:25:34] <Sphincter_Spelunker> @Quiet__Viking I love that
[4:25:37] <%Murphio_GS> @Quiet__Viking that sounds pretty funny
[4:25:39] <HarryMasonSM> Practice!!
[4:25:44] <RickyRelucent> she kinda looks like ninetails
[4:25:47] <eyeobject> 10/10 would get polio from lady
[4:25:50] <RickyRelucent> could work if u color it eggshell
[4:25:54] <RickyRelucent> or beige
[4:25:59] <%traximus_s> chopper is gonna strike out
[4:25:59] <+CursedNobleman> NICE.
[4:26:13] <marklarphd> Creating and planning to delete it is a good way to fight perfectionism
[4:26:13] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Anyone ever been to Akhibara?
[4:26:15] <%SoFarFetched> "Get your polio vaccine"
[4:26:17] <%SoFarFetched> THATS the title
[4:26:20] <%Explodincatz> should have drawn Naruto instead for the "accuracy"
[4:26:22] <+Ghostbuster216> Well, I'm gonna do a lurk, but I'm gonna keep this on for ambience; thanks again to @RobotCo_Op for sending me your way! TombRaid robotc2Rco robotc2Cog
[4:26:26] <HarryMasonSM> lol
[4:26:26] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Polio
[4:26:28] <%Murphio_GS> lmao
[4:26:29] <%Samex_Comex> She wants plasma
[4:26:32] <%Murphio_GS> Polio shot
[4:26:33] <+Scevda> Vaccinate all day long.
[4:26:42] <%Heart0fInk> COVID. in all caps
[4:26:46] <RickyRelucent> "Get your shots you plebeians."
[4:26:49] <HarryMasonSM> robotc2Rco robotc2Corps robotc2Cog
[4:26:50] <$JobbedBone> something something booster shot
[4:26:57] <%Murphio_GS> Fuck yeah, transhumanism
[4:27:03] <robotoken> Naw transfer our consciousness into smart toilets
[4:27:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> Mecha buttholes
[4:27:06] <%traximus_s> would you let her jab you with this mystery syringe
[4:27:11] <HarryMasonSM> Robot Co-op bodies!
[4:27:12] <Sphincter_Spelunker> fuckin hanzers
[4:27:12] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> We're still 100-200 years away before we can successfully transfer organic bodies into robotic bodies, Plague.
[4:27:13] <RickyRelucent> ehhhhhh
[4:27:14] <nip_nips> butthole luddites
[4:27:18] <%Bigchill___> hell yeah
[4:27:19] <Dunmarkh> YES
[4:27:21] <+skm742> we'll keep the buttholes for this purpose only.
[4:27:22] <%Heart0fInk> would you get a human robot body? or an inhuman robot body?
[4:27:23] <RickyRelucent> for alot of em its about not being forced to get a vaccine
[4:27:23] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> I mean robot buddies can help you live forever.
[4:27:29] <%Samex_Comex> We will have a radar that can find more buttholes
[4:27:33] <RickyRelucent> or taking a vaccine thats hasn't been tested
[4:27:34] <+CursedNobleman> Hmmmmmmmmm
[4:27:34] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> bodies! DAMMIT!
[4:27:41] <%Explodincatz> we will hang the buttholes in a museum
[4:27:43] <%cooldude69xx> Its the only sanitary way
[4:27:44] <RickyRelucent> or not effective enough
[4:27:53] <RickyRelucent> takes a few years to get vaccines right?
[4:27:56] <$JobbedBone> I'd become a robot if theres a trial period
[4:28:03] <RickyRelucent> like beyyond decades
[4:28:07] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> I'd become a robot if it means I can survive!
[4:28:10] <RickyRelucent> back in the day
[4:28:10] <mister_not_a_synth> The chat remembers
[4:28:24] <eyeobject> and then paige immediately forgot
[4:28:26] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> Don't get a robot body for cosmetic reasons. Galaxy Express 999 taught us that!
[4:28:29] <nip_nips> and then you forgot
[4:28:38] <Sphincter_Spelunker> twice, I was 2 then it happened again in 4th grade. I was staring at a couch then at a wall
[4:29:02] <cap_bon> Humans a dumb thats why we gotta be robots already
[4:29:04] <jaypeesan> How many times I recalled something from my youth and when I consulted photos it was nothing like i recalled it
[4:29:17] <%Murphio_GS> I think I might've used to have those kinds of memories, but then drugs happened and now I dont
[4:29:22] <RickyRelucent> IF we become robots it wont be us
[4:29:22] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> BE LIKE THE BORG!!!!
[4:29:23] <HarryMasonSM> @bowler_hat_gamer True. but we're all dying... might as well get that robot body. robotc2Rco
[4:29:26] <RickyRelucent> itt'l be like that one game
[4:29:26] <%Murphio_GS> yayy drugs
[4:29:29] <RickyRelucent> fuck whats it called
[4:29:38] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @HarryMasonSM We're still 100 years away from that though. :\
[4:29:39] <RickyRelucent> its underwater and it deals with copies of yyour being
[4:29:45] <%Samex_Comex> Your memories are like a basement full of junk, it's in there somewhere
[4:29:45] <RickyRelucent> and the whole time u think ur a guy in a suit
[4:29:48] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The worst is when you remember a sound, but can't remember where it was from
[4:29:50] <Nenatab> Soma

[4:31:03] <RickyRelucent> i doubt its the charlie im thinking
[4:31:05] <Bowler_Hat_Gamer> @HarryMasonSM We need fully functional limbs and processors before we can adapt to our bodies comfortably. Otherwise, we risk handicap.
[4:31:08] <%Samex_Comex> Get in the zone
