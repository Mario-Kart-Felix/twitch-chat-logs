[0:05:33] <uncleholly> (medli)
[0:05:38] <TheMilhouseExperience> How you doin?
[0:05:40] <jkunblade> good balance so far
[0:05:57] <+payatanharkonnen> Serenade me
[0:06:07] <Murphio_GS> Very surprised that you chose twitch this time around
[0:06:19] <jack_s1n> what do you think they use the beak for? I like to think they slam their faces on nuts to crack them open
[0:06:20] <+FadingEmber> Wait this isn't Picarto
[0:06:23] <JohnClaggart> nah, gotta get that sub money
[0:06:43] <uncleholly> feed the art man
[0:06:49] <uncleholly> feed him your green stuff
[0:07:07] <uncleholly> you too can feed him for as little as one dollar
[0:07:46] <+Dao_Puppy> Does picarto let you change quality yet? I can't watch anything there without it slowing to molasses last time I tried.
[0:07:50] <JohnClaggart> i think you get more viewers on picarto nowadays
[0:08:00] <shinji_ifrit> Sadly the Picarto cellphone app is kinda bad.
[0:08:07] <uncleholly> lookit her how cute
[0:08:27] <$Heart0fInk> Picarto doesn't let the views lower quality of the stream if you have a shitty connection though. like me.
[0:08:33] <TheMilhouseExperience> Thank god picarto fixed their app. It’s not complete garbage anymore.
[0:08:42] <JohnClaggart> you can switch down to flash on picarto
[0:08:44] <OrangeGameCinema> Glad everyone voted for birb girl. Chat has good taste
[0:08:47] <+modmanawesome69> Plague of Gripes? More like Plague of Grapes
[0:09:01] <uncleholly> look at those little hands
[0:09:11] <IntrepidEye> Does Picarto have an archive? I keep hearing Pat and Paige talk about you guys watching Star Trek there? Been meaning to check it out
[0:09:19] <+MMetas> good choices
[0:09:20] <DemonicHoward> watching VODS on picardo is often jank
[0:09:21] <+modmanawesome69> It does have an archive.
[0:09:22] <Murphio_GS> eating gets me dehydrated usually
[0:09:24] <JohnClaggart> it has a video archive
[0:09:29] <ECRead> I'm waging war against bedbugs right now... God help me
[0:09:34] <OrangeGameCinema> Wow I never noticed those shoes until now
[0:09:40] <+payatanharkonnen> Just ate a giant ass
[0:09:41] <JohnClaggart> Ec, use a bugbomb
[0:09:43] <Murphio_GS> Oh god good luck EC
[0:09:43] <kylecoolperson> Socializing is annoying when you don't know anyone. Just a thought.
[0:09:45] <+payatanharkonnen> Me too Eli me too
[0:09:48] <DemonicHoward> maybe its the extra radiation from the over used bandwith that is drying you out
[0:09:56] <+modmanawesome69> the only thing with picarto is that the fucking full screen buffer bar when watching archive videos doesnt go away and its so annoying
[0:09:58] <kell_twit> Hi Eli
[0:10:00] <+Gondab> Did you see that Inceniroar girl on Twitter?
[0:10:07] <+Dao_Puppy> @ECRead don't even try. Sell the house, buy new clothes, spend the night naked in the cold jsut to be sure.
[0:10:12] <+trueavengercj> yooo,just caught the stream.didnt expect to hear john legend (my fave artist)
[0:10:12] <frunkAF> I hate that not socializing makes you seem rude
[0:10:13] <DemonicHoward> picardo archive only holds 12 videos
[0:10:23] <TheMilhouseExperience> I always thought Medli had fe awakening feet.
[0:10:35] <+FadingEmber> I enjoyed you on the Woolie's crushed hopes and dreams podcast
[0:10:49] <+Dao_Puppy> Why is that poor girl's face a dorito...?
[0:10:50] <$Heart0fInk> Youtube has a tantrum over it's own user base
[0:10:56] <Murphio_GS> I've been liking Woolie's little podcast thing so far
[0:11:00] <ccrida> What's this song called?
[0:11:04] <+payatanharkonnen> @fadingember The podcasts was honest good
[0:11:18] <VolatileCarbon> I'm gonna need you to add a few more inches to that girl's nose Plague volati1Demo
[0:11:21] <Wattermany> sup
[0:11:23] <uncleholly> But yall ever play Shadow Hearts tho?
[0:11:25] <Coystick> She is an adherent to the Church of Keighley
[0:11:26] <ECRead> I would bug bomb... but that would involve relocating my pets and then washing every scrap of fabric in the house
[0:11:37] <DemonicHoward> you could maybe upload them as audio only and tell people the episodes in the description
[0:11:37] <+trueavengercj> @ccrida coming home by john legend
[0:11:40] <DoubleDurian> This is already the Hatian Earthquake of twitch streams...
[0:11:42] <Turtle__Loner> big ol stikny toes
[0:11:44] <+FadingEmber> yeah I liked it. zwoolie should do more podcasts

[0:12:43] <frunkAF> you seem like the best person to bounce these hopes and dreams on so you can crush his spirit properly
[0:12:49] <+MMetas> He'll figure it out
[0:12:54] <ccrida> Have you guys talked about doing live recordings like the friendcast?
[0:13:06] <JohnClaggart> super cute radiation
[0:13:12] <+trueavengercj> biohazard birb
[0:13:15] <ccrida> Also that's bio-hazard symbol
[0:13:16] <+Rezca> Post Nuclear Apocalypse
[0:13:17] <+FadingEmber> Thats how she got the beak
[0:13:18] <Wattermany> young artist lookin for resources to help me lose my anime art addiction and have good anatomy, any advice
[0:13:23] <Murphio_GS> Because she's a mutant fish-bird humanoid creature
[0:13:28] <uncleholly> Is Medli Mrs. X?
[0:13:31] <Murphio_GS> that's why she has the radiation
[0:13:42] <TheMilhouseExperience> Mutation and Japan. Did you figure it out? Huh?
[0:13:44] <frunkAF> is this your "working on the farm" playlist, Plague?
[0:13:48] <+Dao_Puppy> @Wattermany porn. Serious answer.
[0:13:59] <Wattermany> ok
[0:14:05] <Wattermany> thanks
[0:14:12] <JohnClaggart> porn or gesture practice
[0:14:19] <JohnClaggart> really the only way
[0:14:20] <+trueavengercj> ^^^
[0:14:49] <vonmaultke> the irony
[0:14:56] <kell_twit> bless you
[0:15:01] <JohnClaggart> salud
[0:15:01] <uncleholly> We just gotta nuke it and start over
[0:15:01] <$MarcusTheBitMiner> bless ya
[0:15:03] <%Sewphee> :o Look at this fancy Plague
[0:15:04] <VolatileCarbon> You're free to contribute to the country's GDP
[0:15:09] <uncleholly> There's just too many people
[0:15:10] <%Sewphee> He has something other than black shirts.
[0:15:11] <TheMilhouseExperience> Bless you
[0:15:13] <Coystick> Compaaaared to? Britain? Fraaaance?
[0:15:13] <$Heart0fInk> Bless you
[0:15:15] <+Dao_Puppy> We're pretty free. You have to CHOOSE to be this paranoid about each other.
[0:15:21] <ccrida> @Wattermany porn commissions, no joke try to get furry commissions because they typically have money for it oddly enough
[0:15:24] <frunkAF> 'and of the free...with the highest incarceration rate per capita.
[0:15:31] <Wattermany> ill do it to the best the law letd me
[0:15:32] <+modmanawesome69> it has nothing to do with too many people, its about population density and geography more than that
[0:15:38] <+Punishedkaiger> As shitty as America is these days, I'm glad I'm here and not in France
[0:15:44] <uncleholly> yeah.
[0:15:48] <+Punishedkaiger> Or anywhere that's europe
[0:15:50] <uncleholly> nuke the high population centers
[0:15:52] <Wattermany> thanks
[0:15:54] <uncleholly> Just do it already
[0:16:03] <uncleholly> we gotta hit refresh on this chrome tab
[0:16:09] <frunkAF> nuclear fallout will solve everything
[0:16:12] <Insanity97> what country has more freedom?
[0:16:15] <uncleholly> don't be a coward, just push the button
[0:16:16] <ccrida> At-least we can play our fortnites unlike commie china saying they're banned
[0:16:16] <valdorick> Just, stay away from the really strange porn commissions. If you're trying to drop an anime style, it won't help to draw a chibi futa horse person tit banging itself
[0:16:17] <Wattermany> also how do we join the discord
[0:16:20] <Murphio_GS> Everywhere has it's problems
[0:16:26] <+trueavengercj> @ccrida as a furry, I can't comfim it personally..but all my friends get art commissions all the time :/ so IM the only poor furry,lol
[0:16:27] <Coystick> I'd rather be in America than anywhere else in the world, aside from Australia or NZ
[0:16:33] <uncleholly> yeah, just nuke it all
[0:16:44] <uncleholly> Medli is telling us
[0:16:50] <uncleholly> high radiation is the key to everything
[0:16:52] <Wattermany> @trueavengercj dont stress
[0:17:01] <Coystick> [sweats in Gascoigne]
[0:17:07] <Wattermany> youll get some
[0:17:07] <%Sewphee> Chat is pretty gloomy right now.
[0:17:08] <frunkAF> I don't care. I have no frame of reference for living anywhere else but here.

[0:52:02] <%Gogogolem> @uncleholly You know they had a special trap they put in Vietnamese prostitutes during the vietname war. They were just razor blades that did harm the woman but owuld tear men apart.
[0:52:02] <brambobelurkin> gotta find a fun way to do it.
[0:52:03] <$Wattermany> smh
[0:52:03] <uncleholly> Liz escaped the HUGE FACILITY
[0:52:03] <%Sewphee> Liz is an orc, that's why she does the exercise
[0:52:07] <valdorick> Exercise is just work without a paycheck.
[0:52:08] <TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah we’re awful. Be better than us.
[0:52:08] <kylecoolperson> I want a monster girl encyclopedia. ..For a friend of course.

[0:52:56] <uncleholly> remember the lust punishment in se7en
[0:52:56] <PistonLiz> idk when you basically train for a living its almost second nature
[0:53:05] <uncleholly> I'll play ball
[0:53:13] <PistonLiz> you essentially become the soreness
[0:53:34] <valdorick> I think that's called Stockholm syndrome.
[0:53:34] <$Wattermany> i forgot se7en existed
[0:53:45] <uncleholly> how did you do that, it's a great film.
[0:53:48] <$Wattermany> 6ix ass name
[0:53:55] <PistonLiz> stockholm syndrome with training?
[0:54:01] <$Wattermany> good movie thi
[0:54:02] <HanPaul> I kinda miss that about retail
[0:54:05] <kylecoolperson> Yamada kun and the seven witches is a good anime.
[0:54:05] <Prism_Wing> Duck Sauce is another awesome Future Funk artist.
[0:54:16] <%Sewphee> I walk something like 5km a shift.
[0:54:18] <TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah “exercise”
[0:54:27] <uncleholly> I lift jeans for a living
[0:54:30] <$Wattermany> MACROSS 82-99's pretty good
[0:54:31] <PistonLiz> yeah exercise is what i call my boo, clearly
[0:54:35] <uncleholly> i pick up boxes full of jeans
[0:54:36] <Saiyza> I believe Nursing is a valid form of exercise work.
[0:54:40] <$Wattermany> and Flamingosis
[0:54:43] <PistonLiz> hes holding me at gunpoint to get bigger
[0:54:46] <HanPaul> you lift bodies as a nurse
[0:54:51] <PistonLiz> im joking please dont call the cops
[0:54:56] <uncleholly> can you bench press me, liz?
[0:55:01] <PistonLiz> IDK MAYBE
[0:55:06] <uncleholly> 196?
[0:55:16] <kylecoolperson> I walk everyday because it is like a meditation of sorts. Walking in a snowstorm is best to be honest with you.
[0:55:22] <HanPaul> sounds like a good weekend
[0:55:23] <PistonLiz> thats gotta be pretty boring imo...
[0:55:24] <Prism_Wing> I partake i n that Flamingosis from time to time. 😎
[0:55:25] <%Sewphee> Is...that depression?
[0:55:35] <JohnClaggart> nah
[0:55:36] <$Wattermany> sounds like me after exams
[0:55:41] <PistonLiz> oh...
[0:55:46] <$around_40_jobbers> I had a few months like that after I got out... those weeks blended together in a scary way
[0:55:49] <+barretzm> Sounds like university
[0:55:52] <uncleholly> plague reminds me to not blast myself
[0:55:54] <HanPaul> this is an eclectic playlist
[0:55:58] <Saiyza> The most dangerous thing you can do with a sedentary lifestyle is buy a minifridge.
[0:56:04] <$Wattermany> @prism_wing my ni🅱🅱a
[0:56:09] <JohnClaggart> plague bought two
[0:56:15] <PistonLiz> when i couldnt train i wanted to stab myself in the thigh i swear
[0:56:24] <Saiyza> Forget not leaving the house, it becomes not leaving a single room
[0:56:26] <HanPaul> @PlagueOfGripes how shit was Woolie's game idea, for realsies
[0:56:30] <uncleholly> right in the juicy thigh bits

[0:57:28] <JohnClaggart> gross
[0:57:31] <Prism_Wing> @pistonliz I have an injured knee, and it ruins my dance practice. Feels like I'm significantly less alive lol.
[0:57:45] <PistonLiz> told ya, it makes you rot from inside
[0:57:47] <Saiyza> I love Plague current art style. It looks amazing in the details, but probably sucks for animation.
[0:57:53] <uncleholly> my trigger finger still operates, so i'm good
[0:58:00] <$around_40_jobbers> My favorite part about plague is that he has the moral fortitude to understand Janeway did nothing wrong.
[0:58:07] <$Wattermany> welcome back to freedom radio
[0:58:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[0:59:24] <Saiyza> @kylecoolperson Night! Good luck being you,
[0:59:33] <valdorick> Hottake - Everyone wants to animate like they're plague, when they should set their expectations to Studio Pierrot.
[0:59:42] <%Gogogolem> This reminds me of she-ra on netflix.
[0:59:56] <+dragoon001914> Ann and Nancy Wilson. Ann's the lead singer and her sister Nancy is the guitarist.
[0:59:57] <uncleholly> didn't pierrot make one good show though?
[1:00:13] <valdorick> I mean, math says they'd have to, right?
[1:00:17] <Saiyza> I love that as She-Ra progresses, the transformation sequence shortens.
[1:00:22] <Samex_Comex> Hello
[1:00:28] <$Wattermany> set thier expectations to Berserk 2017
[1:00:28] <TheMilhouseExperience> Have you decided on a day or night setting?

[1:05:09] <$Wattermany> emergence
[1:05:17] <uncleholly> it's cause you don't exercise the most important muscle
[1:05:19] <uncleholly> the brain

[1:05:21] <Rezca> Math is being too sexy for my mind
[1:05:28] <PistonLiz> my brain is a bit broken, dont worry about it
[1:05:30] <%Gogogolem> we've confused plague with sex math.
[1:05:31] <$Wattermany> for emergence
[1:05:57] <uncleholly> would you say you have had a mind break?
[1:05:58] <EmeraldSage> cheer13 13 The legal sex number in japan *aroused face*
[1:06:07] <OrangeGameCinema> 1800- is another sex number
[1:06:10] <raskole> The computer automated voice puts me to mind of The Last Broadcast (1998). I kind of want to rewatch it now.
[1:06:15] <$Heart0fInk> brownBAN
[1:06:31] <LixFury> 13 for minors wasnt it?
[1:06:34] <$Wattermany> The nhentai link for Emergence, the super fucked up hentai

[1:06:54] <+barretzm> Depends on the area
[1:06:59] <thelovingfool> 13, but ONLY if youre under 18
[1:07:04] <$Heart0fInk> They changed it from 13 to 3 Kappa
[1:07:04] <uncleholly> gotta bump those birth rate numbers up
[1:07:07] <valdorick> Rule 1 of Animemes, don't talk about the forbidden numbers.
[1:07:16] <Prism_Wing> I don't want to live on this planet anymore!
[1:07:19] <$Wattermany> @valdorick he gets it
[1:07:20] <raskole> "It's pre-conception now."

[1:07:26] <OrangeGameCinema> The numbers on the clock are sex numbers. im done

[1:07:36] <uncleholly> NOT FREE HAM SANDWICH DAY
[1:07:40] <Saiyza> Japan is weird, 13 is basically the sex age for any area in Japan outside of an established society.
[1:07:59] <Saiyza> In other words, 13 is the sex number in the wild.
[1:08:02] <Murphio_GS> lol

[1:09:19] <JonKhan> It's hard not to like this song
[1:09:44] <Saiyza> Ah, yes, up on Mexican Lucky. This song confused me for a long time.
[1:09:49] <$Wattermany> you should check out tuxedo's do it
[1:09:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This song is forever associated with the release of that porn game. You know the one.
[1:09:57] <raskole> It already gets weird when you consider leap year kids. I graduated Highschool with a 4 year old.

[1:13:37] <$Heart0fInk> She has a cloaca
[1:13:51] <PistonLiz> i just noticed...does she have two mouths?
[1:14:02] <uncleholly> God i hope so
[1:14:08] <valdorick> No, the beak is just a nose
[1:14:13] <TheMilhouseExperience> She died like that ghost zora chick.
[1:14:14] <Prism_Wing> who doesnt?
[1:14:17] <$Wattermany> @pistonliz ...dammit

[1:14:24] <PistonLiz> you totally see it
[1:14:24] <Saiyza> Don't worry, it's just a pyramid nose beak

[1:14:48] <valdorick> King of Red Lions, ruining everything.

[1:15:02] <$Wattermany> anime nose
[1:15:04] <uncleholly> just a boat
[1:15:09] <PistonLiz> cause the lower part is technically supposed to be a jaw
[1:15:09] <$around_40_jobbers> Remember when the triforce of power was a McGuffin to grant wishes?
[1:15:32] <raskole> Is it a real nose?
[1:15:38] <Risingxiv> people being murdered in the background
[1:15:44] <uncleholly> Nah, it's just cosplay
[1:15:47] <Saiyza> @raskole Fortunately, yes. Kappa

[1:20:04] <$around_40_jobbers> I wonder if Plague really only ever draws wholesome art and (big twist!) we were the monsters all along
[1:20:22] <valdorick> How is that a twist?
[1:20:31] <uncleholly> @around_40_jobbers and Alice was a real girl all along
[1:20:33] <Saiyza> Plague can't sandbag the thighs he drew on Hekapoo.
[1:20:48] <EmeraldSage> i like being a monster tho
[1:21:00] <$around_40_jobbers> @valdorick I'd post that simpsons gif of "That's the joke" but I can't do that here
[1:21:11] <valdorick> Touche

[1:25:24] <Spydurman> Really liked you on Woolie's podcast, I think you really nailed it with their idea and creative projects in general
[1:25:25] <$Wattermany> oooooooooooooooooh
[1:25:32] <bursky00> I can hit that note but boy I can't sing at all
[1:25:47] <$Wattermany> drop that mixtape🅱
[1:25:58] <JohnClaggart> the harder note is the end of the arpeggio after going up
[1:26:06] <+dragoon001914> I heard Meatloaf is notoriously bad live.
[1:26:28] <$Wattermany> lol all rappers now
[1:26:31] <sylphyyyy> I saw them with my mom and her siblings one time. Good time.
[1:26:37] <Coystick> Morrissey always puts on a show when he's live, when he doesn't cancel.
[1:26:41] <+barretzm> Most bands are bad live. Some that are good are accused of faking it
[1:26:43] <$Wattermany> live soundin like
[1:26:50] <%Sewphee> I dunno, you're at least in tune when you try, that's more than some people have.
[1:26:50] <JohnClaggart> you can develop a mastery of your range though, plague
[1:26:56] <$Wattermany> UHMUNUHMUNUHUH
[1:27:10] <JohnClaggart> you dont need the alto range
[1:27:25] <raskole> I won't see my favorite band live. I won't say their name but the lead singer is notorious for being smashed on stage when they perform.
[1:27:36] <+silvery_cricket> whats with the slow fuckin music?
[1:27:43] <JohnClaggart> slow?
[1:27:53] <JohnClaggart> this is like 122
[1:28:05] <$Wattermany> bed creaking in the background
[1:28:06] <+barretzm> Drunk singing has to be bad
[1:28:07] <sylphyyyy> This is a bop
[1:29:04] <$around_40_jobbers> If the bpm isn't higher than snoop than how is he supposed to draw?!
[1:29:18] <sylphyyyy> Hahaha
[1:29:30] <+silvery_cricket> Ever think about how the red lion is a dude
[1:29:33] <+spiceyweasle> oh my god plauge added a cam

[1:29:57] <$Wattermany> KevinTurtle

[1:31:12] <%Sewphee> Oooh, we swinging now
[1:31:18] <raskole> Because I would imagine the King works like a Lich with a Phylactory and all.
[1:31:18] <sylphyyyy> octoImpacto
[1:31:45] <%Sewphee> We getting rowdy
[1:31:54] <+barretzm> Because people spend money on random things
[1:31:57] <JohnClaggart> humphry bogard
[1:31:57] <%spiceyweasle> I had a job once Ill probably have a job again no worry's it's only a pack of smokes I shouldn't smoke
[1:32:10] <Morkardar> thats some nice artistry right there
[1:32:17] <EmeraldSage> is this what the kids are listening to these days? it is quite hip if i might say.
[1:32:18] <sylphyyyy> Man just watching him makes me miss my computer, I really want it to come back from the shop already octoSad
[1:32:41] <%Sewphee> Kick out those gams, pump up the jams.
[1:33:05] <sylphyyyy> LUL LUL LUL do you?? You’re really good at it for someone who hates it
[1:33:22] <sylphyyyy> The proportions are believable even if you’re bullshitting them.
[1:33:44] <sylphyyyy> God reference picture hell.
[1:33:59] <TheMilhouseExperience> Oh no
[1:34:08] <Coystick> cel shading best shading
[1:34:21] <+silvery_cricket> Doesn't the king of hyrule drown himself to death at the end of Windwaker?
[1:34:29] <$Wattermany> I cant talk in the discord
[1:34:45] <raskole> Yes.
[1:34:47] <$Wattermany> sorry
[1:34:49] <Dastardry> It was very nice of Boat dad to drive Link and his bird girlfriend to their first dungeon date.
[1:35:08] <madpuppy2424> Does anyone know what this song is called?
[1:35:13] <sylphyyyy> Warp that just a little, plague.
[1:35:16] <%Sewphee> Contact Conclave member Dacon, he's going by Dac Skellington at the moment @Wattermany
[1:35:32] <$Wattermany> @sewphee thanks
[1:35:34] <TheMilhouseExperience> Before link just dumps and leaves her there.
[1:35:44] <raskole> I'm convinced that is the King's phylactory.
[1:36:31] <valdorick> "Hey burd gurl, wanna like, go out or whatever? I know this place some people died. We could rave there or whatever." - Link, Probably.
[1:37:23] <Dastardry> Link is very good at tossing birds
[1:38:12] <+silvery_cricket> "Hey Medli, I just got like. A new Slingshot wanna go like... kill some seagulls with me?" - Link Probably
[1:38:28] <$Heart0fInk> I clapped when i heard the ratchet. I Clapped!
[1:38:33] <Murphio_GS> huh
[1:38:35] <+barretzm> It'd make a pretty tombstone
[1:39:12] <Samex_Comex> Yeehaw!
[1:39:27] <+silvery_cricket> Plague are you just defaulting back to Deviantart, or are you gonna use stuff like ghost or behance?
[1:39:30] <%spiceyweasle> lol while it's kind of on the subject of spending monies on being supportive of youtube/internet people I once traveled thousands of miles to see a youtube video premier lol
[1:39:34] <TheMilhouseExperience> Yeah ever clear.
[1:40:14] <+silvery_cricket> that amazing was well timed
[1:40:21] <%Sewphee> Oh lordy this song
[1:40:22] <gamma_wavve> yesss
[1:40:25] <%Sewphee> Been a while
[1:40:32] <gamma_wavve> like the desets missed the rain
[1:40:39] <gamma_wavve> deserts
[1:41:14] <%spiceyweasle> if anyone is curious it was auralnauts ep. 6 the last laser master
[1:41:16] <TheMilhouseExperience> This song reminds me of the Chris kattan mango skits.
[1:42:08] <gamma_wavve> you could put any early 90s dance hit with cthat and itd work
[1:42:21] <$Heart0fInk> Ever play wind waker plague?
[1:43:19] <+silvery_cricket> Aside from the 10 minute demo I never played WW
[1:44:04] <valdorick> Is this song the prequal to Africa?
[1:44:40] <+silvery_cricket> Put on Pinball Wizard and lets all have a good time
[1:45:18] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> stayhyBottle Welcome to SHBv5: Mod+ can now type !emotehydrate to toggle emote mode when sending hydration reminders. Also your settings may now be changed from my chat while you are offline.
[1:45:49] <EmeraldSage> are we still doing the sex numbers things? I still have some leftover bits.
[1:45:55] <JohnClaggart> thanks hydration bot
[1:46:00] <TheMilhouseExperience> !emotehydrate
[1:46:01] <Samex_Comex> I wish I was tough enough
[1:48:46] <raskole> I was going to rewatch Battle Royale tonight but Plague's chill stream kind of did something warm and fuzzy to my heart so I don't want to watch it tonight.
[1:49:12] <%Sewphee> Hahaha
[1:49:40] <kell_twit> such an annoying angle
[1:49:43] <+IMDRanged> Eli's forehead gives us a sense of calm
[1:50:05] <raskole> Me: "Plague's chill stream." Plague: "I hate this." Me: *awkward stare at monitor.*
[1:50:18] <%Sewphee> It was great timing.
[1:50:38] <Coystick> maaaaaan it's been a while since I heard five for fighting
[1:51:19] <%spiceyweasle> @raskole we are with ya
[1:52:53] <%Sewphee> Where have I heard this before...
[1:53:02] <JohnClaggart> you heard the translated one
[1:53:06] <raskole> I came to the realization that the Studio that owns the rights to produce an American adaptation of Battle Royale most likely won't because they won't want it confused with Fortnite. or they'll use the name like G-Force" and make it a FortNite movie.
[1:53:37] <%Sewphee> Oh he's a big angry art bear.
[1:53:45] <Murphio_GS> Man I know that feel
[1:53:46] <Samex_Comex> You can do it
[1:54:04] <%Sewphee> Gaaaooo
[1:54:27] <Huntercd> But Fortnite has zombies and building, it's not strictly battle royal shooter
[1:54:30] <JohnClaggart> i like gaoo more than grr as an onomonopeoia
[1:54:57] <raskole> Gaaooo Gaarrooomps
[1:55:58] <BillieNoMates> All alone tonight, Plague? No Paige to harass?
[1:56:43] <+tussletoes> What song is this?
[1:56:53] <gamma_wavve> dreams by fleetwood mac
[1:57:10] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:57:11] <+tussletoes> Thanks!
[1:57:19] <Coystick> da mac
[1:57:25] <$Heart0fInk> you can't drain me
[1:57:26] <Saiyza> This is dreams from the heart. <3
[1:57:46] <Murphio_GS> So when you playing Fortnite, Plague? *dabs*
[1:58:00] <forgetme000> wow i've caught two streams in a row
[1:58:18] <raskole> Takeshi Kitano voice: Life is a Gaayumn!"
[1:58:19] <JohnClaggart> you guys think fleetwood mac would play fortnite?
[1:58:23] <$Heart0fInk> Plague is going to dethrone Ninja Kappa
[1:59:02] <+barretzm> YouTube rewind could've dethroned him
[1:59:26] <raskole> I tried playing the CS:GO BR mode and my penis began shouting at me, "Why don't you just punch me directly in the face instead of playing this. It would be easier on both of us."
[1:59:52] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @plagueofgripes stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:00:06] <$Heart0fInk> you have an odd relationship with you penis
[2:00:10] <%Sewphee> Big thank water boy
[2:00:16] <raskole> We have our weekly talks.
[2:00:23] <raskole> Partners need that.
[2:00:36] <$Heart0fInk> Thanks borderline virus hydration bot!
[2:00:49] <JohnClaggart> her hair is also a weird auburn
[2:00:57] <+MMetas> goodnight plague, have a good night and sleep well
[2:00:59] <raskole> Speaking of the Rewind video though.
[2:01:08] <TheMilhouseExperience> He. 8oz? I’m on 32oz.
[2:01:09] <$Heart0fInk> @MMetas Gnight
[2:02:01] <+barretzm> Night Plague
[2:02:11] <raskole> Youtube pretty much just summed up it's feelings on animators in it, didn't it? They have all the popular "stars" staring awkwardly at the animators like, "Who invited you?" It was a little too meta.
[2:03:14] <TheMilhouseExperience> Better than last year where they got shoved in at the end. Like it was last minute.
[2:03:43] <$Heart0fInk> you think youtube will ever get it's act together? or do you think it'll die first?
[2:03:58] <$Heart0fInk> My vote is on die.
[2:04:16] <Coystick> Do they exist in 3D?
[2:04:17] <gamma_wavve> somethings gotta dethrone it first though
[2:04:22] <raskole> I keep holding out for Disney/Maker to start its own Creator-centric platform for the Maker contracts if it is even still a thing.
[2:04:31] <EmeraldSage> Yea, i like them Yandere eye colors too.
[2:04:44] <Coystick> muh gypsies
[2:04:46] <JohnClaggart> red eyes only exist on albinos
[2:04:49] <TheMilhouseExperience> It’ll probably change hands a few more times before getting its act together. Or it’ll be replaced. Either or.
[2:04:51] <raskole> I like this take on the coloring better.
[2:04:53] <thick_tofu12> Great artist how many years have you been drawing ??
[2:04:55] <Risingxiv> Google owns Youtube so I dont think it will ever die
[2:04:56] <$Heart0fInk> Purple eyes tho. brownRAYGASM
[2:05:05] <Saiyza> Makes her look capable. Almost like she was born with purpose.
[2:05:26] <Risingxiv> If anything I think Twitch or some version of it will slowly just take more popularity
[2:05:37] <Coystick> probably something about red being the color of fruit/flush skin
[2:05:41] <$Heart0fInk> It can die. if it costs more to keep up than it's worth google with cut ties with it
[2:06:39] <Risingxiv> amazing that Newgrounds just blew up again off of Tumblr's corpse
[2:06:47] <%spiceyweasle> huge was inspirational for me
[2:06:59] <$Heart0fInk> and 8 years from now you'll say what you draw now is garbage
[2:07:02] <Explodincatz> i just wish NG had a better art page layout
[2:07:03] <Mr_Strut> Porn finds a way
[2:07:05] <raskole> Tumblr punched itself in the winky-dink.
[2:07:05] <+irrationalsound> i was going to say, huge was a masterpiece
[2:07:08] <Huntercd> RIP Tumblr I will miss the ladies
[2:07:08] <EmeraldSage> One man's garbage is another man's treasure.
[2:07:30] <JohnClaggart> purple with orange highlights
[2:07:32] <Coystick> Albino girls
[2:07:38] <Risingxiv> or yellow eyes, Werewolf eye color
[2:07:39] <valdorick> Red Eyes take Warning... IN MY PANTS! Hue hue hue
[2:07:50] <Saiyza> Yes, because the red eyes will glow and she will stare with iris fully visible.
[2:07:50] <valdorick> Idontknowwhatimdoingwithmylife
[2:07:56] <sosuke5> Red eyes? Like the dragon?
[2:08:00] <TheMilhouseExperience> They’re secretly black dragons.
[2:08:02] <%spiceyweasle> lol I had lasik recently my eyes were fairly red after that
[2:08:04] <$Heart0fInk> what about yellow eyes?
[2:08:21] <raskole> I want to get lasik but the f*ing Simpson's scared me from it
[2:08:28] <Endocrom> A girl with goat eyes <3
[2:08:33] <Mr_Strut> Delicious eye scabs
[2:08:36] <%spiceyweasle> thats jandice @Heart0fInk
[2:08:46] <EmeraldSage> Hyuga eyes are sexy
[2:08:54] <+irrationalsound> jaundice is yellow skin
[2:08:57] <raskole> That scene with blind Ned and Homer goes, "What happens?" "Oh I should of waited for more research on the lasik before I got it done."
[2:09:07] <TheMilhouseExperience> @raskole final destination did that for me.
[2:09:11] <TheButtravage> @PlagueOfGripes Hey Eli, decided to listen to your dark souls podcasts to get through work, thanks for the work you do.
[2:10:02] <raskole> It is criminal we live in a world in which there is a Grudge vs. Ring crossover fight film but no Final Destination vs. SAW
[2:10:10] <Murphio_GS> Yes
[2:10:18] <Murphio_GS> very criminal
[2:10:24] <Coystick> I binged Frealed's Odyssey on my third screen at work all last month
[2:10:27] <Rezca> How... how would such a movie work?
[2:10:40] <Saiyza> I wonder if people who talk too much enjoy content where others talk terribly long.
[2:10:49] <valdorick> Its made from her feathers maybe?
[2:10:52] <Saiyza> Gonna make it gray?
[2:10:54] <%Sewphee> Isn't it darker?
[2:10:54] <TheMilhouseExperience> That’s like man vs god in who can create the best elaborate death test.
[2:10:55] <Explodincatz> ??its slightly more gray
[2:11:00] <raskole> We'll put Top Men on it.
[2:11:01] <+InkblotBlues> Maybe it is made from lesser bird people?
[2:11:02] <Murphio_GS> Make it slightly darker or something
[2:11:06] <Coystick> It's made from the skin of her mother
[2:11:07] <JohnClaggart> gamecube only had 15k colours
[2:11:12] <sosuke5> I mean, beige is close to white skin colour
[2:11:16] <%spiceyweasle> @irrationalsound I think it's yellow white in your eyes also ( thanks for spelling correctly also) ;)
[2:11:59] <raskole> But that wasn't a joke. There really was a Ring vs. Grudge movie made.
[2:12:20] <raskole> Possible plans on an American adaptation.
[2:13:11] <Saiyza> @raskole So, basically there was a tv on in a haunted house, and there was a duel on who would have to get out of bed to turn it off?
[2:13:12] <Rezca> No, we need Human Centipede vs Saw
[2:13:40] <raskole> Like, if you look up the trailers for it on Youtube it is the hypest shit.
[2:13:47] <+Ryosuke91> yoo how u been plague
[2:13:51] <raskole> Grudge ghost just straight up shatters one of the VHS tapes.
[2:13:57] <raskole> in it's hand.
[2:14:05] <EmeraldSage> sadako is best girl
[2:14:50] <Risingxiv> SeemsGood
[2:15:36] <raskole> But I think the premise was playing one of the tapes in the Grudge house and put the spirits into a fight to the... uh... undeath?
[2:16:09] <+D4C_Trice> So what has led to medli being drawn?
[2:16:10] <Saiyza> Huh. Not a huge fan of the green for some reason. Maybe the shading will even it out in my head.
[2:16:22] <mikk_ad> Just entered The stream, what song is this?
[2:16:33] <+Ryosuke91> is this a particular character hes drawing?
[2:16:59] <Huntercd> Are either of those ghost girls over 18?
[2:17:03] <TheButtravage> @Ryosuke91 It's a legend of zelda the windwaker side character.
[2:17:06] <Bluewolf94> its from legend of zelda wind waker
[2:17:16] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:17:21] <Dragonfighter46> hello
[2:17:21] <raskole> huh, I think the film was called Sadako vs. Kayako
[2:17:24] <+Ryosuke91> ohh got it
[2:17:25] <Saiyza> @ryosuke91 It's Medli from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker
[2:17:41] <JohnClaggart> ah yes, my favourite dixie chicks song
[2:17:46] <+Ryosuke91> thats interesting that she has basically a biohazard symbol on her garment
[2:18:16] <%spiceyweasle> do any of you guys like sigur ros?
[2:18:28] <Saiyza> Yeah, the symbol looks better with the orbs inside the divits
[2:18:36] <Saiyza> divots*
[2:19:04] <+Ryosuke91> i wonder if it's a coincidence, but her beak is like those beaks that the old plague doctors use
[2:19:07] <gamma_wavve> sigur ros is great
[2:19:13] <+Ryosuke91> so that with the biohazard symbol kinda matches
[2:20:00] <%spiceyweasle> if i need to chill fleetwood mac and sigur ros are my go to
[2:20:11] <+RevolverOcelot16> I love this Stevie Nicks song
[2:21:40] <Coystick> Go-Betweens and Waterboys are my go to chill bands
[2:21:43] <%spiceyweasle> I was watching vanilla sky on tv a couple weeks ago and the end credits was a sigur ros song it totally threw me off
[2:21:48] <Saiyza> I hate having to pause in my work between songs playing. Just throws me off.
[2:22:10] <%Sewphee> I got fancy cookies.
[2:22:27] <JohnClaggart> the shortbread ones?
[2:22:45] <%Sewphee> Nah they came in a big fancy tin
[2:22:55] <%Sewphee> All different kinds of weird cookies
[2:23:01] <valdorick> The stale Christmas cookies!?
[2:23:04] <%Sewphee> Apparently they're european
[2:23:09] <CasulPants> Cheer50
[2:23:29] <JohnClaggart> post in discord
[2:23:41] <%Sewphee> Must I?
[2:23:49] <JohnClaggart> yarp
[2:24:00] <Jontman42> Morning from Finland
[2:24:03] <%Sewphee> Fine, fine, one moment.
[2:24:18] <%spiceyweasle> I just started playing D2 again and fancy cookies made me think of Gjallardoodles lol
[2:24:49] <SanguineXIII> Are we talking about grandma's cookie tin of random keys, tacks, and other sharp, non-cookie objects?
[2:25:03] <Samex_Comex> Leave Jiren to me
[2:25:06] <valdorick> Who will defeat Jiren - the song
[2:25:12] <Saiyza> I was not expecting this song...
[2:25:16] <TheButtravage> That was a tone shift.
[2:25:23] <JohnClaggart> "this is my time" ~tien before losing
[2:25:27] <valdorick> Hurt myself laugh coughing.
[2:25:41] <TheButtravage> I mean, it's closer to my personal taste so I can't complain.
[2:25:48] <$CasulPants> cheer50
[2:25:53] <TheMilhouseExperience> Isn’t this from jstars?
[2:25:59] <+donpatrondx> *Tien singing this at karaoke while crying*
[2:26:02] <raskole> This song reminds me I need to register for Funimation so I can finish watching SSSS.Gridma-- I mean Dragon Ball. Clearly Dragon Ball.
[2:26:08] <EmeraldSage> Ultra instinct powers activate!
[2:26:12] <+MagickBurritoh> love butt rock no matter what language
[2:26:16] <%Sewphee> There, I posted cookies
[2:26:31] <Samex_Comex> What luck Jiren is allergic to humans
[2:26:54] <valdorick> But the real question is... How strong is Jiren?
[2:27:59] <raskole> I would say at this point power levels mean nothing since they're all essentially God Tier.
[2:28:13] <raskole> Which makes sense as to why Ultra Instinct is so different.
[2:28:13] <Saiyza> Ah, this song has a nice build-up and drop.
[2:28:41] <TheButtravage> What was the best thing Super brought us? I personally vote Kefla.
[2:28:53] <EmeraldSage> You guys should watch Plauge's videos on power levels in his Dragonball channel
[2:28:53] <$Heart0fInk> And with that i'm off to bed. Later nerds! brownSLEEP
[2:29:01] <valdorick> I read that as Kefka...
[2:29:08] <Samex_Comex> Monaka
[2:29:16] <valdorick> Which, considering the Clown god, also not wrong.
[2:29:31] <TheButtravage> @EmeraldSage Too busy listening to his Dark Souls podcast to watch his Dragon ball channel atm.
[2:30:46] <jggoryl> jammin tunes hot damn
[2:31:58] <raskole> I think I will watch it. Of cours ethe last time I watched one of Plague's videos this late I fell asleep and had some weird dreams.
[2:33:20] <valdorick> Horrifying monsters of the dream scape weird dream, or chased by thicc, beautiful horrors that want to do unspeakable things to your ribcage weird dreams?
[2:33:51] <EmeraldSage> and also the one about Japan doesn't like Tien
[2:33:52] <Murphio_GS> Man, I love windwaker
[2:34:10] <Murphio_GS> Is it because Tien reminds them of China?
[2:34:29] <raskole> Sort of.
[2:34:32] <EmeraldSage> Watch the video and find out
[2:34:40] <Saiyza> Those lines give Medli crow's feet. Really changes her tone.
[2:34:55] <Murphio_GS> I've watched his video, it's been a while
[2:35:14] <TheButtravage> I wish I enjoyed Windwaker more than I did.
[2:35:34] <TheButtravage> My personal favorite Zelda is Majora's Mask though.
[2:35:45] <valdorick> @Saiyza She speaking in a thick southern accent and says "massa" an uncomfortable amount of times? As voiced by Disney.
[2:36:41] <Saiyza> @valdorick Nah, just give her a life action remake, and churn her through the Netflix movie filter.
[2:36:53] <Coystick> Ayyy those are some wind waker waves
[2:37:25] <valdorick> Ah, so she's from Seattle and sells drugs for a living.
[2:37:54] <Saiyza> The beak is replaced by a giant nosering
[2:39:16] <%Sewphee> Plague have you ever been on a boat?
[2:39:39] <+tknot21> Sup, I heard this song for the first time outside of Eli's stream at work today.

[2:41:06] <%Sewphee> Yeah, I was thinking about how you ain't really had much to do with a lot of water.
[2:41:18] <TheButtravage> @OrangeGameCinema That rabbit hole is beyond depressing.

[2:46:14] <valdorick> There it is, that's the other sex number
[2:46:55] <valdorick> Well, yeah, unless someone has some kinda loli bird nun fetish.
[2:46:58] <OrangeGameCinema> But the egg. it's implying
[2:47:17] <Saiyza> Any and all sexual energy is stored in her amber stare.
[2:47:19] <+InkblotBlues> Maybe they were talking about the boat? Mmm, splinters.
[2:47:22] <+tknot21> So we have had a couple pics of hay rides, a boar ride (the implication), when will we get a sleigh ride?
[2:47:25] <TheMilhouseExperience> It’s wholesome except it’s not anything.
[2:47:26] <+tknot21> boat*
[2:47:38] <Saiyza> Luckily, the shine just makes her cute.
[2:48:03] <Samex_Comex> I'm dead
[2:48:22] <Murphio_GS> Did he just say "I hope you sure arn't gay"?
[2:48:26] <OrangeGameCinema> Draw an island of in the distance, with a ninja on it
[2:48:49] <%spiceyweasle> dead its a modest mouse cover

[2:54:42] <+The4winds> gimme pitou
[2:55:01] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Is your content still allowed on Tumblr?
[2:55:23] <%Sewphee> That's a bit better
[2:55:32] <+tknot21> Yeah, but hes migrating...to Newgrounds? Amazing its coming back into the limelight
[2:56:00] <deathsaw> that and twitter are getting tumblr migrants
[2:56:01] <TheButtravage> So what are you primarily going to use?
[2:56:11] <Samex_Comex> Everything by everyone
[2:56:21] <Coystick> Tumblr more like Bumblr lmao
[2:56:23] <jeecay> Drawing's comming along well
[2:56:40] <Coystick> good looking waves
[2:56:55] <deathsaw> I remember when newgrounds was "the problems of the future:today"
[2:57:08] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:57:25] <Coystick> @deathsaw that's some slogan nostalgia
[2:57:26] <jeecay> Ah Newgrounds. It was the perfect fit for my edgy hormonal teenaged self
[2:58:03] <Coystick> whackin' it to dress up bulma flash games, those were the days
[2:58:11] <TheButtravage> Oh, Pitou was in the vote? I didn't think Plague was aware of the character.
[2:58:33] <deathsaw> playing Skull Kid was my nostalgia for the site
[2:58:38] <deathsaw> that and the porn flashes
[2:59:03] <Samex_Comex> lol
[2:59:05] <valdorick> One thing
[2:59:09] <Murphio_GS> Oh god
[2:59:10] <+tknot21> Interesting take
[2:59:12] <Murphio_GS> this again
[2:59:14] <%Sewphee> Ahaha
[2:59:22] <jeecay> fascinating.
[2:59:28] <valdorick> 10/10
[2:59:31] <Coystick> It's starts wif waaaaaaaan
[2:59:33] <deathsaw> rip chester

[2:59:42] <Murphio_GS> Pitou would've been a good pick
[2:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @plagueofgripes stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.

[3:40:10] <jeecay> do any of the zelda bird people become the chozo?
[3:40:18] <+tknot21> yeah, it is a really weird fowl color
[3:40:28] <laserbeaming> Isn't Zelda race design wildly inconsistent across games?
[3:41:00] <TheMilhouseExperience> R.E.M.

[3:44:23] <%Sewphee> Periodically Plague looks directly into the webcam, and it;s like, oh no.
[3:44:29] <Huntercd> Yo

[3:46:01] <%Sewphee> I'm getting a cold.
[3:46:06] <%Sewphee> Trying to stay awake.
[3:46:09] <jeecay> This album was my whole fuckin world 2 decades ago
[3:46:20] <Coystick> This mashed up with September by Earth, Wind, And Fire is elite.
[3:46:21] <Huntercd> The video for this song, blue skin women yea.
[3:46:24] <@dcn2049> Oh no, more sneezing?

[3:47:43] <Samex_Comex> More pizza please
[3:48:09] <EmeraldSage> cheer78 here are my last bits. Hope its enough for a snack.
[3:48:11] <jeecay> I wish I could eat pizza. Lactose intolerance is a gift form the devil
[3:48:12] <TheMilhouseExperience> Did you drink water while eating? most people don’t.
[3:48:16] <Fluxraw> Nutrition B.I.G.
[3:48:24] <OrangeGameCinema> day old cold pizza > hot fresh pizza
[3:48:42] <valdorick> Whore myself out to ads
[3:48:42] <Grandma_Amari> You can buy them outright I think
[3:48:43] <laserbeaming> You can buy them
[3:48:45] <Murphio_GS> you pay for them
[3:48:48] <OrangeGameCinema> buy or watch ads
[3:48:52] <valdorick> You can also just buy 'em for an awful exchange rate
[3:49:06] <%Sewphee> What are they even for, what do you use them to do?
[3:49:15] <TheMilhouseExperience> Buy or watch ads on mobile.
[3:49:18] <jeecay> eat ass for 12 bits
[3:49:20] <Fluxraw> what eli trys to say @emeraldsage is: Thank you.
[3:49:21] <valdorick> Hey! I don't suck dicks for anything less than a twitch nickle!
[3:49:24] <OrangeGameCinema> 1 bit = 1 cent to streamer. 1 to 1 ratio
[3:49:29] <EmeraldSage> Yea i gave a lot of blow jobs for these bits
[3:49:33] <%Sewphee> Huh
[3:49:35] <Samex_Comex> Can I pay my bills with bits
[3:49:38] <OrangeGameCinema> however the buy rate is like 1 to 1.02 or something
[3:49:55] <SaltyDongs> 2 blowjobs for 300 bits what a steal
[3:50:04] <Murphio_GS> I like music with people arguing in the background
[3:50:10] <Grandma_Amari> Have you drawn Pat as a cube
[3:50:10] <valdorick> 1 to 1.4
[3:50:40] <gamma_wavve> 187 viewers how appropriate to this song
[3:51:22] <valdorick> I like music with people arguing in the background too... It reminds me of home.
[3:51:24] <laserbeaming> Well, it's still a better ratio than subscriptions
[3:51:42] <jeecay> @gamma_wavve LOL
[3:52:05] <Murphio_GS> Damn
[3:54:12] <Fluxraw> what would you call eli's spotify playlist ?
[3:54:21] <jeecay> good
[3:54:21] <Coystick> Hungry for bird ass
[3:54:42] <valdorick> That flutist does seem to be just having a ball.
[3:54:59] <Coystick> Give me a Souls game with Wind Waker cel shading.
[3:55:09] <TheMilhouseExperience> You really outdid yourself plague. Nice work.
[3:55:21] <Murphio_GS> I really like this one
[3:55:23] <Grandma_Amari> @Coystick Isn't that Ashen, sorta? I mean maybe not really
[3:55:47] <Coystick> From what I've seen of it, a bit.
[3:55:51] <Tampaoster> Hi Plague, how are you doing today?
[3:55:57] <EmeraldSage> BotW is a cell shaded Dark Souls in desguise
[3:56:24] <DukeMoose> oh man. that look. thats the "i genuinely enjoy our time together" look
[3:56:35] <Grandma_Amari> I'm really interested in Ashen, I saw it pitched as Souls meets Journey with that sort of cell-shaded Absolver art style.
[3:56:52] <+MisterCrimson> I was thinking it was more of a "Hi Link, I've seen your balls, you know."
[3:57:02] <+tknot21> @EmeraldSage Not even close, no
[3:57:05] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:58:25] <TheMilhouseExperience> Every t shirt you buy makes Eli die a little on the inside.
[3:58:49] <+tknot21> I would buy this one
[3:58:52] <EmeraldSage> or makes Pat grow in seize
[3:59:20] <Grandma_Amari> Or makes Woolie stop stealing pies
[3:59:29] <Grandma_Amari> (No he wont)
[3:59:39] <EmeraldSage> good times
[3:59:49] <+tknot21> Joke be dead as Eli's smiling muscles
[3:59:50] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @plagueofgripes stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:59] <Grandma_Amari> I miss those dumb adverts for their t-shirts they put at the end of videos.
[4:00:01] <%Sewphee> Take a siiiiiip
[4:00:06] <Samex_Comex> But a shirt and get out
[4:00:15] <TheMilhouseExperience> That’s actually about the time I started watching Sbfp.
[4:00:16] <valdorick> Speaking of sucking chodes … THANKS HYDRATED BOT!
[4:00:21] <laserbeaming> Hydration Bot demands you drink!
[4:00:25] <Murphio_GS> Groovy jams time
[4:00:26] <laserbeaming> Kappa
[4:01:22] <jeecay> maybe Eli's part camel?
[4:01:44] <laserbeaming> Maybe he can gather humidity from the air
[4:01:48] <suikudo> Sheeeet!
[4:02:03] <Coystick> Song name?
[4:02:04] <Tampaoster> Hydration bot was ignored summarily
[4:02:09] <Grandma_Amari> Plague is basically Quiet
[4:02:14] <+MisterCrimson> this crimson shading says, "I just clawed my way out of Jabu-Jabu's belly."
[4:02:34] <laserbeaming> Jabu-Jabu deserved it
[4:02:51] <+Cook_4_Souls> and the lead singer from the Gap Band
[4:02:52] <%Sewphee> Gaaaooooo

[4:03:50] <jeecay> @tknot21 How dare you. I"m an alien and I'll thank you not to call me a human again :P
[4:03:53] <madpuppy2424> You look more like an E
[4:04:03] <%Sewphee> Crack open the false tooth, exit life.
[4:04:14] <Samex_Comex> Dance Robo

[4:08:11] <BrachyZoid> Love how this is coming along, Plague
[4:08:12] <valdorick> Oh good, the raid has custom ass emotes. We don't need to tone ourselves down as to not scare them away.
[4:08:14] <Samex_Comex> Panties!
[4:08:37] <BrachyZoid> For the Brachydios and zoid because I had no idea what to put there
[4:08:48] <BrachyZoid> Also I suck at names
[4:08:48] <Artista_AF> brachy1Brabuns octoNut2
[4:08:59] <BrachyZoid> koboldLul
[4:09:05] <+tknot21> My fave was Stegosaurus as well.
[4:09:20] <Samex_Comex> Ankylosaurus is cool
[4:09:32] <+InkblotBlues> Kentrosaurus is neato.
[4:09:40] <Tampaoster> Eli the farmer artist
[4:09:40] <BrachyZoid> I'm a simple bitch who loves Velociraptors
[4:10:05] <Coystick> For me, it's Yutyrannus. The Feathered Tyrant.
[4:10:09] <jeecay> my name is mud
[4:10:09] <+tknot21> Thats a-okay. @BrachyZoid
[4:10:11] <%Sewphee> Cannot understand a word, tbh.
[4:10:30] <+BritishMarshmallow> Hey Chat, hey Plague
[4:10:35] <Murphio_GS> There's some really cool dinosaurs out there
[4:10:41] <Tampaoster> emonPraise
[4:10:46] <+MisterCrimson> Shit. I tried to google that stegosaurus and I found an article about some allosaurus fossils that show that it died from a stegosaurus spike to the dick.
[4:10:54] <Murphio_GS> What about the buck-toothed Dinosaur?
[4:11:00] <+tknot21> Thats rough buddy @MisterCrimson
[4:11:25] <+MisterCrimson> Prehistoric sounding was lethal
[4:12:12] <Raconteur999> @PlagueOfGripes hey, you're cool with people coloring in your line art, right?
[4:12:21] <%Sewphee> There's an unsettling amount of moths outside.
[4:12:37] <%Sewphee> Oop, and my stream died.
[4:12:43] <Grandma_Amari> Moths want that birb
[4:12:53] <Tampaoster> I really like the Giant sloths we had here in Brazil after the reptilian age They found some fossils and they were huge!
[4:12:59] <+MisterCrimson> suspicious egg? Kakyoin, did you lay this egg?
[4:13:05] <@dcn2049> moths are just fuzzy butterflies
[4:13:15] <+tknot21> I believe it was either Stego + T-Red or Triceratops and T-Rex @PlagueOfGripes
[4:13:22] <%Sewphee> Oh there we go
[4:13:25] <Murphio_GS> Yeah, most popular dinos are from totally different Era
[4:13:32] <laserbeaming> Plot Twist: The King of Red Lions laid the egg
[4:13:34] <doodruid> you can still find dens of the giant ground sloths
[4:13:43] <Murphio_GS> There's tons of cool Giant Sloths
[4:13:46] <doodruid> like they are still intact and just huge long tunnels
[4:13:52] <%Sewphee> Imagine riding a giant sloth like a horse
[4:13:54] <Murphio_GS> There was an aquatic Sloth
[4:14:16] <Coystick> Soft lighting makes her look fluffy
[4:15:00] <+MisterCrimson> @Sewphee a DnD group I was in had giant sloth mounts
[4:15:04] <+tknot21> mmm golden
[4:15:06] <laserbeaming> She looks much fluffier than in the game, a welcome improvement
[4:15:07] <%Sewphee> Noice
[4:15:24] <Raconteur999> hey, chat, I lost the audio right when he might have answered my question. Did he respond?
[4:15:34] <+tknot21> Having upper eye lids helps
[4:15:39] <laserbeaming> @MisterCrimson 10 feet land speed, 5 feet climb speed? Kappa
[4:15:41] <%Sewphee> Were you asking about colouring lineart?
[4:15:49] <Raconteur999> yes I did
[4:16:00] <%Sewphee> Yeah he said he didn't care
[4:16:01] <gamma_wavve> yeah hes cool with it
[4:16:17] <Raconteur999> thanks, sorry for the repeat
[4:16:26] <+MisterCrimson> @laserbeaming you bet. really got us through that dense forest fast

[4:21:19] <Grandma_Amari> A nose that demands to be honk'd
[4:21:27] <EmeraldSage> booped
[4:21:36] <Grandma_Amari> Booped AND honk'd
[4:21:56] <+tknot21> Or right, i guess since solid, you wouldn't be really able to kiss her huh?
[4:22:11] <arkv01> its just a maple leaf
[4:22:12] <arkv01> but green
[4:22:19] <Raconteur999> so does this mean she stole the King of Red Lions from Link?
[4:22:27] <jeecay> the only weed plague sees are the ones he rips out of the ground
[4:22:36] <%Sewphee> :O Plague has seen meth?
[4:22:40] <gamma_wavve> @jeecay lol
[4:22:42] <%Sewphee> With your real eyes?
[4:22:45] <EmeraldSage> 420 Praise it
[4:22:48] <%Sewphee> I've never seen meth.
[4:22:56] <suikudo> Its windy
[4:23:01] <jeecay> where there is poverty and boredom you can find meth
[4:23:08] <Murphio_GS> Slow sail
[4:23:09] <Huntercd> Meth induced psychosis sounds horrible
[4:23:13] <+tknot21> Like Fresno
[4:23:13] <arkv01> meth is just powdery snow
[4:23:16] <Blayde_Keller> meth isn't too uncommon in the Midwest is it plauge
[4:23:18] <arkv01> soon meth will rain from the skies
[4:23:20] <Murphio_GS> Wave Riding
[4:23:22] <valdorick> It smells like skunk, I know this because WA just plops those greenhouses anywhere! Even next to residential areas! But can't have a bakery near those, might offend people's noses with the smell of fresh bread..
[4:23:31] <Samex_Comex> They lost the sail and Link is pushing
[4:23:31] <%Sewphee> I've seen a bunch of weed, and I've seen e
[4:23:33] <suikudo> Yea its windy and link is changing sail types while she sits on her ass smiling
[4:23:35] <%Sewphee> And lsd
[4:23:41] <laserbeaming> It's a magic talking boat, I can suspend my disbelief for a missing sail
[4:23:42] <Coystick> Dad Boat installed a propeller
[4:23:44] <i_am_therydon> where's the handle to steer the boat?
[4:23:47] <valdorick> Okay, I say WA, I just mean my town... in both cases... oof
[4:24:03] <Tampaoster> Drugs are for losers. Don't Do School, Eat your drugs and go to vegetables kids!
[4:24:06] <%Sewphee> Aaaah, spores
[4:24:22] <jeecay> WA likes the weed. almost as much as colorado
[4:24:40] <Murphio_GS> She's watching Link fall overboard
[4:24:40] <arkv01> washington's too close to vancouver
[4:24:43] <arkv01> weed capital
[4:25:06] <cowunstoppable> so what is last dessert people have had here? mine was nuttella
[4:25:26] <%Sewphee> I had a caramel pudding

[4:25:32] <laserbeaming> Ice Cream
[4:25:32] <jeecay> it was terrible
[4:25:42] <%Sewphee> With ice cream and custard
[4:25:44] <Murphio_GS> Mine was ice cream
[4:25:44] <Grandma_Amari> I'm not sure if peanut butter and jelly sandwiches count as dessert in a pinch
[4:25:53] <Tampaoster> I eat ice cream yesterday and it was delicious
[4:26:01] <arkv01> pound cake
[4:26:05] <cowunstoppable> @jeecay from a restaurant?
[4:26:07] <Murphio_GS> Green it up a bit
[4:26:08] <Tampaoster> ate ice cream
[4:26:10] <laserbeaming> It's so fucking hot down here that it's hard to sleep. I wish I had more ice cream
[4:26:13] <jeecay> NOPE
[4:26:24] <arkv01> hot in december?
[4:26:27] <%Sewphee> This song reminds me of that song where he talks about loving the sea and how he can't be with the pretty barmaid
[4:26:35] <+tknot21> @PlagueOfGripes If you want to go the yellow-ish it will look like a salvage point in the game
[4:26:35] <laserbeaming> Southern Hemisphere @arkv01
[4:26:35] <cowunstoppable> @sewphee pudding cup or cake and all?
[4:26:41] <jeecay> It was in the discount section of a grocery store. and not from the bakery department
[4:26:42] <%Sewphee> Cake and all

[4:26:47] <jeecay> aka red flag number 1
[4:26:51] <%Sewphee> And egg
[4:26:55] <Murphio_GS> It's part of the boat

[4:27:34] <Tampaoster> Whoa i love this song !
[4:27:44] <+Rocky117XBL> Link laid an egg?
[4:27:48] <jeecay> @arkv01 it's what I get for being poor and wanting things
[4:28:00] <Grandma_Amari> How dare you want things
[4:28:03] <+tknot21> @Rocky117XBL YOU DAFT BOI?
[4:28:03] <Tampaoster> Disco Inferno!
[4:28:25] <laserbeaming> Disco is not dead. It's just kind of a zombie.
[4:28:33] <jeecay> @Grandma_Amari my audacity is as deep as it is profound.
[4:28:34] <+Rocky117XBL> I just want to know if that's an egg or part of the boat
[4:28:35] <cowunstoppable> now i want an ice cream sandwich
[4:28:43] <jonnyjargon> what was the last song that played
[4:28:50] <Tampaoster> Necromance that shit up then @laserbeaming
[4:29:00] <gamma_wavve> anytime i hear this i just think of the scene in "hobo with a shotgun" where the two brothers burn down the bus with kids in it
[4:29:19] <+tknot21> It be an egg son
[4:29:20] <arkv01> jeecay I feel ya man but better poor and healthy than food poisoning and hospital bills
[4:29:20] <Tampaoster> Yeah that scene is fucked up
[4:29:44] <Raconteur999> hey, chat, anyone have more recommendations for artists who do line arts and don't mind third-party colorists?
[4:29:52] <jeecay> @gamma_wavve I like the callback to that scene later in the movie
[4:30:01] <Murphio_GS> lol
[4:30:10] <Coystick> Why is the egg suspicious?
[4:30:13] <OrangeGameCinema> No! That drawing is dank
[4:30:16] <%Sewphee> @PlagueOfGripes Can we listen to Brandy?
[4:30:17] <laserbeaming> The Egg is a metaphor. I don't know what a metaphor is.
[4:30:26] <EmeraldSage> But lewds is what makes wholesome stuff better.
[4:30:31] <cowunstoppable> @raconteur999 probably a lot on deviantart. don't know any offhand
[4:30:35] <Grandma_Amari> Good job, Plague!
[4:30:36] <Coystick> a metaphor for a balanced breakfast
[4:30:43] <jeecay> MISSION COMPLETE
[4:30:49] <Coystick> gg
[4:30:57] <Grandma_Amari> What time is for you, Plague?
[4:31:00] <gamma_wavve> @jeecay yeah its a good callback
[4:31:20] <vonmaultke> the metaphor is don't be afraid to sleep with anything humanoid and intelligent no1BOLD
[4:31:20] <%Sewphee> He sinking
[4:31:21] <Murphio_GS> Plague melt
[4:31:23] <laserbeaming> Plague is in Central US time, so it's 2 am there I think?

[4:31:29] <%Sewphee> Help Plague
[4:31:31] <Grandma_Amari> Oh so same as me :>
[4:31:33] <$valdorick> cheer250
[4:31:33] <jeecay> Melty plague
[4:31:34] <Raconteur999> @cowunstoppable tumblr's implosion is sending my usual sources off to other sites
[4:31:37] <laserbeaming> probably
[4:31:45] <cowunstoppable> plot twist, this is alternate version of Kratos and egg is BOY
[4:31:51] <arkv01> is it that bad on tumblr these days? What about the non-porn stuff?
[4:31:53] <Murphio_GS> Feet is too lewd
[4:31:54] <Samex_Comex> Uh oh a naked foot
[4:32:04] <MrHappyFunshine> I watch a streamer that plays video games with his feet so i guess not
[4:32:11] <gamma_wavve> career over
[4:32:16] <valdorick> I sucked a lot of Advertiser's D's for that blood money.
[4:32:29] <laserbeaming> Foot Fetishists RISE UP
[4:32:35] <arkv01> @valdorick the advertisers didn't say stop
[4:32:39] <vonmaultke> I think i prefer Picarto streams Jebaited if only they informed me when it starts
[4:32:44] <@dcn2049> those'll give you the shits
[4:32:46] <jeecay> I'd eat them
[4:32:49] <Grandma_Amari> Wait is there a fridge right off camera lol
[4:32:50] <EmeraldSage> why not both?
[4:32:55] <gamma_wavve> no on the white castles
[4:32:57] <arkv01> throw in some veggies plague
[4:33:01] <arkv01> get your fiber
[4:33:03] <MrHappyFunshine> It's pretty damn impress considering he will play two games at the sametime
[4:33:04] <valdorick> Apparently they did, because they said they don't have anymore 'ads' for me... TODAY.
[4:33:10] <gamma_wavve> unless you wanna painful shit
[4:33:13] <%Sewphee> Hmm
[4:33:21] <%Sewphee> None of those...sound good
[4:33:27] <jeecay> use the pizza rolls as replacement for fries alongside the white castle things.
[4:33:32] <TheMilhouseExperience> Neither have steak.
[4:33:32] <MrHappyFunshine> yay cancer
[4:33:35] <arkv01> but plague you must keep your body pristine... for us
[4:33:37] <Raconteur999> it's my observation that the best artists are the one's that have the most frequent output. nothing stokes output like lewds. Hence, some of the best artists do a lot of lewds
[4:33:43] <+InkblotBlues> Try it you'll like it!
[4:33:48] <jonnyjargon> nice
[4:33:55] <cowunstoppable> noct, i mean plague better get some cup noodles
[4:33:56] <Coystick> Excuse you.
[4:33:59] <valdorick> 'strokes output' eh?
[4:33:59] <+brindlebull> wow major progress since I last saw it, when it was koala talk
[4:34:07] <+tknot21> Brandy

[4:34:26] <KingKrampus> Ahoymehoy
[4:34:29] <%Sewphee> Thank you Plague
[4:34:47] <%Sewphee> Doesn't feel like a Plague stream without Brandy
[4:34:53] <+tknot21> Gawd I love eli's take on hairs everytime
[4:34:55] <Raconteur999> don't bring that koala stuff up again, I just finished repressing it

[4:35:07] <Grandma_Amari> Same, @tknot21
[4:35:31] <Grandma_Amari> Looks so THICK, I lovei t.
[4:35:37] <TheMilhouseExperience> How often has everyone came across a huge festering pile of pap.
[4:35:45] <jeecay> that cheap cake is hurting my tummy
[4:35:58] <arkv01> pepto?
[4:36:06] <jeecay> it'll prolly pass
[4:36:36] <Grandma_Amari> The answer is discount pepto that is actually just powdered pink chalk.
[4:36:36] <cowunstoppable> @jeecay i see what you did there
[4:37:07] <arkv01> you say that but my local superchain has their own brand of pepto
[4:37:17] <arkv01> and it tastes suspiciously powdery
[4:37:20] <Raconteur999> "you;ll go blind!"
[4:37:32] <%Sewphee> Looks like ocean
[4:37:48] <Grandma_Amari> RUDE

[4:38:00] <laserbeaming> jerks off furiously
[4:38:00] <%Sewphee> Looks like the sea near here actually
[4:38:01] <Grandma_Amari> Thanks for streaming, Plague.
[4:38:02] <TheMilhouseExperience> The ocean is really blue when you get out there
[4:38:07] <+InkblotBlues> Thanks for the stream!
[4:38:10] <valdorick> You can't just play ALL your favorite songs! Then we have no reason to come back!
