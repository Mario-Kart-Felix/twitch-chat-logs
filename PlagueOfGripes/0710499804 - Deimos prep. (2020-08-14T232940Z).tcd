[0:00:55] <%Void_The_Dark> Hey Eli
[0:01:01] <+arancet> yay turd
[0:01:06] <%Void_The_Dark> How is everyone?
[0:01:14] <+Taglog7> Any new furry waifu?
[0:01:22] <$VoxFoxWatch> Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 it’s been SO LONG!
[0:01:24] <+Taglog7> waifus*
[0:01:55] <%Void_The_Dark> Big problems, big questions, small answers
[0:02:02] <+Demonstrandum> Holy moly, a stream I can catch! Suck it, timezones
[0:02:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> Sup eli
[0:02:20] <%TheZanic> TheZanic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! hey plague thanks for introducing me to hololive. my life is now ruined.
[0:02:35] <+durthknight> Plague, Pat is being crazier than normal tell him to stop
[0:02:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Im also trying to learn how to stream
[0:02:49] <+stinkomeanie> Jesus Christ your warframe looks like an ancient religion.
[0:02:50] <%Void_The_Dark> You had an art stream recently?
[0:03:07] <+EpicBigchill> plague time!
[0:03:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Hmmmm
[0:03:54] <e_maginary> i didn't really likes steel path
[0:03:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> That would be wise
[0:04:02] <HorribleHog> I just shut down the PC
[0:04:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> no it isn't
[0:04:10] <HorribleHog> It's the only way to make sure
[0:04:19] <e_maginary> they are kinda lack of creativity this warframe been
[0:04:45] <+stinkomeanie> Don’t show care for your computers, it shows a bad precedent.
[0:04:51] <CyberDingus> zentreWOAH Hello grumpy farmer man
[0:04:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> Bios is always last step
[0:04:59] <+Demonstrandum> Stare into the Dark Abyss of Windows 10 settings
[0:05:14] <e_maginary> window 10 is quite mess
[0:05:23] <+alpharius88> hey get the umbra pedestal from baro...
[0:06:08] <+Demonstrandum> I guess my hoarding of every frame I've ever owned finally pays off ? Still feels bad to burn them :-/
[0:06:15] <The_Grey_Ghost> hey Eli, was curious if I could use your explanation of the Ki system as the basis of a combat thingy I'm making?
[0:06:15] <+Korzodin> Just buy them all for like 500 bucks
[0:06:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes did you clean your regestry?
[0:06:47] <+Korzodin> Pay the game so you don't have to play it
[0:07:10] <HorribleHog> I love how steel path and arbitration amps it up
[0:07:11] <+ThePayphone> god i remember playing this game around the first event, arid fear
[0:07:17] <+Demonstrandum> I suppose you are opposed to trading for plat and just buying a Khora ? Because that might save you dozens of hours
[0:07:37] <HorribleHog> The problem sounds like your basic Win10 bullshittery
[0:07:45] <TwoStarPlayersNik> Equinox? I see you are a fellow man of culture!
[0:08:27] <%Void_The_Dark> kinda bad
[0:08:33] <raveous> this looks pretty bad
[0:08:34] <+Demonstrandum> Compression is having a rough time
[0:08:35] <mutantlunchbox1> grainy
[0:08:38] <The_Grey_Ghost> blehhh
[0:08:40] <+Korzodin> Looks like low bitrate, movement makes everything blurry
[0:08:42] <raveous> bit rate is just nonexistent
[0:08:48] <+ThePayphone> i played warframe for 1892 hours before uninstalling it 2 or so years ago
[0:08:56] <TheFuriousMilkman> Hey plague, how do you feel about the new ability draft lol
[0:09:04] <+Korzodin> Hack your modem to give yourself better internet
[0:09:05] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes It isn't that sometimes a regestry file fs up just run a basic scan and it eleminates majority of the problems. even new computers get messed up
[0:09:17] <+stinkomeanie> Spirit Energy
[0:09:45] <+ThePayphone> did you play back when the grineer had english voice lines and told eachother to stay close to the walls?
[0:09:52] <The_Grey_Ghost> I purposefully dropped my stream to 480p and it looks like something from the ps1 days at points on my end
[0:09:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is the video grannular to you guys alaso?
[0:10:03] <+Demonstrandum> Doesn't Vaykor Hek give Health+ though ?
[0:10:13] <raveous> that's what really matters
[0:10:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Evil Plague
[0:10:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> Glad you like it!
[0:10:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:10:42] <Ashenik1> @PlagueOfGripes What do you enjoy about Wraframe? I thoguht you prefer more defensive aproach to gameplay
[0:11:05] <The_Grey_Ghost> "I don't know what you guys are talking about, on my end it looks great"
[0:11:24] <+ThePayphone> i think my ghost clan dojo had multiple event statue things even though i was the only member
[0:11:31] <The_Grey_Ghost> (I know you're joking)
[0:11:56] <+stinkomeanie> I blame computers.
[0:13:06] <cap_bon> holy shit my stream is just artifacting like crazy. Twitch really struggles with warframe huh.
[0:13:19] <The_Grey_Ghost> so any more ranty "this anime fucking sucks/is hypocritical as fick" videos planned?
[0:13:22] <+stinkomeanie> Welcome to PlagueOfTechSupport stream
[0:13:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> better?
[0:13:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> dunno
[0:13:57] <The_Grey_Ghost> definitely looks solid now
[0:14:20] <cap_bon> Is railjack playable now
[0:14:34] <+Demonstrandum> So, looking forward to doing Defection for Harrow again ?
[0:14:38] <The_Grey_Ghost> (I'm on 480p tho on a 2 heat old phone so don't take my opinion as law)
[0:14:53] <The_Grey_Ghost> 2 gen old*
[0:15:06] <laserbeaming> OwO
[0:15:23] <Huntercd> What did they impove?
[0:15:32] <%kyh9> kyh9 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to make a proper Raid for Warframe. I guess too many mechanics to balance?
[0:16:07] <laserbeaming> Warframe is far from methodical. It's more about going guns blazing in all directions
[0:16:19] <+stinkomeanie> I haven’t played Warframe in years, before it’s first major patch. Last frame I played was I think called Trapmaster or something but I loved it.
[0:16:20] <HorribleHog> It seems a lot for that particular game
[0:16:35] <%kyh9> Truly the Xenoverse of action games
[0:16:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> What about the far cry series?
[0:17:13] <HorribleHog> Turn yourself off, *and* turn yourself on!
[0:17:59] <cap_bon> Thats why I liked Kuva farm just running around nuking shit mindlessly
[0:18:04] <Huntercd> The space capitalists deserve to die
[0:18:09] <wettowel12> Which frame is that?
[0:18:20] <AegisREDflector> I feel that. I like looking at an artistically cool game and keeping my hands busy. I like games for relaxation, I don't want to have to concentrate too much.
[0:18:20] <+alpharius88> equinox
[0:18:48] <CynosZilla> Nezha also has damage reduction.
[0:19:06] <cap_bon> for like a solid 2-3 years rhino was the only thing that could survive in high level shit
[0:19:25] <Huntercd> I like Mirage I never liked the idea of Rhino
[0:20:03] <cap_bon> I think my most played frame is still Trinity because I really enjoy giving everyone infinite energy and seeing them go nuts
[0:20:11] <+Demonstrandum> Love me some Health Conversion on Nezha or Rhino
[0:20:16] <+KROmega> I feel like if Rhino could reset Iron Skin without his 2 aug then he'd be strictly fine. Keep in mind it frees a whole mod slot in most high end builds so DE might not want to do that.
[0:20:22] <TheAsylumCat> I like the idea behind vuban and ivara being utility characters, but that doesn't amount to much compared to nuke characters
[0:20:56] <laserbeaming> Well, now there's the Shield Gating thing that will make it harder for you to get one-shot
[0:21:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> though, ivara is much better as far as utility goes compared to booben, plus she's a fantastic solo frame
[0:21:15] <+Demonstrandum> Also Nezha can shield allies, which I really like (mostly for Radiation sorties)
[0:21:31] <HorribleHog> Soon all frames will have a solid option to get infinite energy and survivability will only matter in bossfights
[0:21:40] <cap_bon> and giving people overcharged shields with energy vampire is also fun
[0:22:00] <+KROmega> Rhino actually scales off of damage taken as well it's just not as good because he has his 1 aug
[0:22:07] <laserbeaming> wait, what solid option for Energy? Is it coming in Deimos?
[0:22:20] <HorribleHog> the warframe splicing
[0:22:44] <Daxalog> All warframes suck. Octavia is kay
[0:22:46] <laserbeaming> which energy ability is available?
[0:22:52] <+KROmega> Also taking lots of damage isn't a good way to scale unless you have something like a turret that buffs enemy damage big but can be permanently destroyed so it can't be used against you again.
[0:22:57] <HorribleHog> Gara's with her augment
[0:23:14] <laserbeaming> oh right, Spectrosiphon or something like that
[0:23:16] <TehMud> That's me with my Rhino build. I have the Charge into extra armor augment and live for days.
[0:23:23] <HorribleHog> ayup
[0:23:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> wisp has been my favorite since she came out. Nice team support, damage, and if you fuck up just jump
[0:23:37] <+QuasartheHero> Hydro and reaper
[0:23:39] <Huntercd> Mirage is squishy but I like her
[0:23:50] <cap_bon> on those level 100 sorties if your not immune to damage you jsut sorta melt
[0:23:54] <laserbeaming> I love Harrow
[0:24:01] <TehMud> Protea is nice on Defense but otherwise eeehhhhh
[0:24:24] <%Samex_Comex> Yay Plague stream!
[0:24:29] <HorribleHog> I love Harrow's Deluxe + the hood from Graxx
[0:24:29] <+Nomenanza> I see warframe hasn't change since last time I played ~6 months ago, still farming the same map bitterThought
[0:24:30] <laserbeaming> since the Shield Gating thing, it's easier to use Harrow
[0:24:42] <AegisREDflector> I've only played for around 260 hrs., and Gara is really crazy tanky for almost no energy cost. Her and Rhino hard carried me.
[0:24:57] <defaultname3887> ey plague already got the true endgame umbral pedestral ?
[0:25:08] <HorribleHog> I love Harrow because he can do everything
[0:25:21] <HorribleHog> Heal, Energy, Damage, shields for survival
[0:25:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is thi infinite mode or something?
[0:25:33] <TehMud> I don't know exactly how many hours I've put in this game since I forget to close it too often
[0:25:37] <laserbeaming> that's a Nyx
[0:25:39] <CynosZilla> I have to agree. Harow needs all his abilities up all the time and I just can press all these buttons all the time.
[0:25:44] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> a wild nyx LUL
[0:25:46] <TehMud> Nyx is still a thing?
[0:26:00] <Huntercd> Nyx deluxe looks so good
[0:26:02] <+Sirsquizz> nyx is surprisingly in a kinda decent place right now
[0:26:17] <HorribleHog> I was so bummed to realise that you can't equip two augments for the same skill
[0:26:18] <cap_bon> Member back when they could walk around super slow but invincible and then DE changed it so allies could drain all their energy instantly LUL
[0:26:22] <+alpharius88> nyx is good in steel path for interception
[0:26:26] <laserbeaming> Nyx is actually half decent now that Spychic Bolts are a thing. As long as you avoid getting hit
[0:26:26] <HorribleHog> My nyx dream went out the window
[0:26:30] <TehMud> True. I haven't used Nyx in forever though
[0:26:30] <CynosZilla> Nyx is ok. Defense strip, and enough shields to abuse Arcane Aegis a bit.
[0:26:50] <+cephalon_nyt> Nyx has been useful fo rme on Steel Path
[0:27:12] <cap_bon> People wanna run around and make rooms of enemies explode instantly
[0:27:12] <TehMud> Mag
[0:27:17] <GarrisonWaifu> "Hey guys, want another CC frame?"
[0:27:21] <HorribleHog> Nekros (:
[0:27:23] <defaultname3887> they will never get quite there i think, disagreement on what warframe is i think
[0:27:38] <+Nomenanza> I just wonder if my Valkyr is still viable
[0:27:38] <laserbeaming> Adaptation was a Godsend
[0:27:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> plagueGripes_TK
[0:27:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> I'm quite proud of myself
[0:27:56] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ah yes, farming khora aka suffering
[0:27:58] <+Sirsquizz> rng is rng
[0:28:02] <HorribleHog> Especially when most "harder" enemies are based in ignoring warframe abilities
[0:28:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> plagueGripes_TK
[0:28:05] <TehMud> I've still got my popcorn ready to see how much Helminth breaks the game
[0:28:06] <+Demonstrandum> So, trading for plat and buying one is not an option ?
[0:28:17] <CynosZilla> Give your valkyr a nikana and a daikyo. Go eternal war. have fun :v
[0:28:36] <cap_bon> Can you show your Harrow
[0:28:40] <cap_bon> fashion frame ho
[0:29:04] <HorribleHog> I love the Equ augment that splits a buddy out for you
[0:29:05] <Antero_legion> Hello Plague!
[0:29:17] <+KROmega> We really won't blame you after Rest and Rage becomes generic with Deimos.
[0:29:21] <+Nomenanza> @CynosZilla I used to run with a warcry spam melee with Gara's glasshammer, the other one was just focusing on staying in berserk iirc. That was months ago though
[0:29:28] <Huntercd> Ugh its too much
[0:29:35] <laserbeaming> Night Equinox is good to farm some stuff
[0:29:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> It's seems that rewards you to grind
[0:30:01] <HorribleHog> I agree in that Focus promotes warframes that nuke... but it's "fine"
[0:30:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> and grinding sucks
[0:30:04] <+Sirsquizz> pog wall time
[0:30:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> GRINDING SUCKS
[0:30:12] <+alpharius88> nidus
[0:30:19] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nidus is awesome, but slow
[0:30:42] <+KROmega> Nidus really wants to stand in one spot and just build and that's not a thing that we need to do.
[0:30:48] <DensityD> hello plague
[0:30:49] <TehMud> Nidus is super fun, but yeah it takes a while. Once he snowballs though on defense it's crazy
[0:31:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> thats a final fantasy character
[0:31:14] <DensityD> yummy
[0:31:14] <Huntercd> Is Railjack soloable now?
[0:31:15] <defaultname3887> pogcham helminth
[0:31:16] <TehMud> Can you still clip into him?
[0:31:19] <+Nomenanza> oh they added a mouth to it now
[0:31:22] <laserbeaming> I love Helminth
[0:31:23] <sasparillatango> august 23rd?
[0:31:25] <GarrisonWaifu> just give it a little smooch bitterKiss
[0:31:28] <+alpharius88> pog wall
[0:31:30] <Huntercd> Its a talking cyst
[0:31:33] <cap_bon> What is that Nurgle shit
[0:31:39] <TheAsylumCat> feed me Seymore
[0:31:41] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:31:46] <Daxalog> So its been growing all this time?
[0:31:52] <+Demonstrandum> I liked the Ahegao eyes on Helminth
[0:31:59] <DensityD> that's a great harrow
[0:32:00] <+Nomenanza> are those fucking bats
[0:32:02] <laserbeaming> That's a Tennogen Harrow
[0:32:04] <+Nomenanza> you edgy boi
[0:32:07] <cap_bon> fancy
[0:32:13] <TheAsylumCat> he's a mean Green mother from outer space
[0:32:15] <laserbeaming> Harrow is good in Disruption
[0:32:15] <DensityD> batface the rouge
[0:32:16] <Huntercd> Priest man
[0:32:18] <+Rada150> do you use him for eidelon farming
[0:32:26] <%Samex_Comex> Never ending bats
[0:32:35] <sasparillatango> get another nidus yet?
[0:32:37] <DensityD> complete the collection
[0:32:40] <+Demonstrandum> Need some help / company with that farming ? Could use some old frames myself
[0:33:08] <+Rada150> i made my volt look like the Flash
[0:33:15] <cap_bon> I stopped playing like 3 years and every now and again I come back but get overwhelmed with got no clue what to do
[0:33:19] <+DeweySalt> Volt just needs duration and efficiency for Eidos
[0:33:34] <GarrisonWaifu> Poor Volt, I only use him for Eidolon hunting these days
[0:33:46] <sasparillatango> I'm thinkin 4 needs to be built for range
[0:33:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @cap_bon how dare you not watch every single devstream like a good boy
[0:33:52] <sasparillatango> so that it bounces
[0:34:12] <+KROmega> in ESO it's about timing. Volt's 4 scales off population so you want to use it right after the game spawns lots of enemies.
[0:34:15] <+Rada150> remember when golem was a thing
[0:34:17] <TehMud> Oh god my original grind for Atlas was such a pain
[0:34:18] <HorribleHog> 300% strength + augment for 1st ability for Voltyboi
[0:34:28] <+Nomenanza> I like that Vauban over there is designated as Suck
[0:34:29] <cap_bon> theres just so much content thats been released and I got no clue what to do,
[0:34:35] <+Nomenanza> havent changed much I see
[0:34:36] <$Rivalshotzgp> Rush the arcanes for removing operator death debuffs and magnetic invulnerability arcanes and then eidelon farming can be fun
[0:34:49] <laserbeaming> chroma is also one of the ones you would want to send to Helminth
[0:34:55] <sasparillatango> chroma's subsumed is trash anyways
[0:34:56] <AegisREDflector> And a sayrn part. Oof
[0:34:59] <CynosZilla> baruk is a little monster
[0:35:17] <Huntercd> Yep Fortuna farming suck
[0:35:20] <Di0_brando> for subsuming rhino is easily the best first choice
[0:35:22] <GarrisonWaifu> I really like Baruk, I'd have to farm up another, cuz I'm not feeding my current one to wall mouth
[0:35:25] <TheAsylumCat> I like how my Meza looks like a Bloodborne hunter but it's not meta
[0:35:27] <+Nomenanza> Fortuna farming when it came out just made me quit
[0:35:31] <+Nomenanza> I really didn't like it
[0:35:32] <+Rada150> i hope they do make the werewolf warframe
[0:35:36] <HorribleHog> Never had problem farming toroids o_0 Nekros ftw i guess
[0:35:53] <Di0_brando> yeah jordas golem
[0:36:17] <jowi_time> RAID
[0:36:18] <asurite_warrior> Looks just like you. I am the precursor to the pat raid
[0:36:23] <+ArchimerCXV> god i still dont have grendel
[0:36:25] <CynosZilla> Grandel farm is P A I N
[0:36:26] <TehMud> I don't have Grendel either
[0:36:33] <TehMud> Yeah PAIN
[0:36:34] <+Demonstrandum> God, the Grendel missions are such a pain in the ass. That was a plat purchase for me
[0:36:37] <$Rivalshotzgp> I have a feeling all of the ability transfers will just be the 25 energy lightning bolt type ones
[0:36:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> what does the wall mouth give you if you feed him?
[0:36:37] <+cephalon_nyt> RIP
[0:36:39] <+Rada150> have fun doing arbtration
[0:36:43] <Huntercd> Does Gara still have her codpiece?
[0:36:47] <+Rada150> yeah only one person needs the piece
[0:36:48] <GarrisonWaifu> i said fuck it to Grendel farm and just bought him, one of the few times i've done that
[0:36:55] <laserbeaming> I mean, you have 9k platinum, maybe it's worth it to buy Grendel, Khora and maybe Ivara?
[0:37:02] <defaultname3887> void keys
[0:37:16] <sasparillatango> I still need grendel
[0:37:20] <CynosZilla> It still is P A I N
[0:37:20] <sasparillatango> I have the key on europa
[0:37:21] <defaultname3887> and yeah just buy them dude u have 9plat e.e
[0:37:26] <+KROmega> They're not hard they're just really boring.
[0:37:29] <+cephalon_nyt> it is a pain
[0:37:40] <+cruciferouskale> you don't need a build
[0:37:43] <+KROmega> And if you have 4 people they're trivial even without Octavia.
[0:37:44] <ECRead> ... I use Octavia
[0:37:45] <+alpharius88> no MODS
[0:37:47] <defaultname3887> nidus is greeat for the survival
[0:37:49] <+ArchimerCXV> hildryn gets mentioned a bunch for those, and i dusted my week 1 hildryn for being week 1 hildryn
[0:37:55] <$Rivalshotzgp> Ivara has 4 good abilities so that’s worth a farm
[0:37:56] <CynosZilla> Octavia, probably the best frame of the game. No one likes to use her. :v
[0:38:00] <laserbeaming> Farming the Harrow Systems is PAIN
[0:38:03] <HorribleHog> I use octavia for stealth on sorties
[0:38:11] <+ArchimerCXV> there's a number od reasons im not entertaining this new system
[0:38:24] <Huntercd> Sailor moon
[0:38:27] <DensityD> strange
[0:38:29] <sasparillatango> he's a dainty boy
[0:38:30] <GarrisonWaifu> twink
[0:38:32] <defaultname3887> alien head sailor moon
[0:38:38] <+ArchimerCXV> he shoulda been the last prime yeah
[0:38:39] <CynosZilla> I can imagine nezha outside his delux skin. :v
[0:38:43] <CynosZilla> *cant
[0:38:48] <laserbeaming> Twink Prime
[0:38:49] <+KROmega> Nezha is an actual child in lore so that's why he's so thin and has implied shortness
[0:38:50] <+alpharius88> Grendel missions are misions with NO MODS thats the pain
[0:38:54] <DensityD> RIOT!!!!
[0:38:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> his prime better be chonky
[0:38:56] <sasparillatango> male/female cycle
[0:39:02] <Huntercd> Sailor Moon prime
[0:39:06] <HorribleHog> will he be twink or deluxe prime?
[0:39:12] <defaultname3887> hopefully it will be adult nezha
[0:39:13] <GarrisonWaifu> "just golden my shit up fam"
[0:39:20] <Just_Ori> I love his deluxe skin
[0:39:20] <sasparillatango> how amazing is liger?
[0:39:28] <laserbeaming> I think the male/female cycle was broken with Wukong Prime
[0:39:30] <+ArchimerCXV> given the feedback on base nezha i think prime is gonna have the big penor to stop people being ocnfused
[0:40:02] <+ArchimerCXV> and i just LOVE they stuck Inaros prime's design on the weapons that came with him instead of actually appropriately designing the weapons
[0:40:14] <RichAtArt> Don't diss the FemBoy DRIP!!!!!
[0:40:20] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nezha prime is just empyrean but with an even bigger bulge, god bless
[0:40:20] <+Apathiae> So is it like a pool where the power has unlimited uses or is it a one time use thing and you have to feed it again to put the power on another frame?
[0:40:37] <+ArchimerCXV> it's a pool you build up
[0:40:45] <~PlagueOfGripes> https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1212921-the-helminth-dev-workshop/
[0:40:45] <HorribleHog> I hope they do something different tbh, we can afford one cute manboy, we have enough machos
[0:40:58] <+KROmega> Once you put in the warframe you have access to that power forever.
[0:41:03] <+Demonstrandum> TL:DR: Participate in vore, gain power
[0:41:05] <VroomSoon> Eat frame get it's power
[0:41:34] <laserbeaming> finally, a use for Gallium
[0:41:40] <+alpharius88> secretions
[0:42:08] <sasparillatango> thats *fine* depending on cost
[0:42:09] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh god that does sound like them, oh noo
[0:42:12] <+DeweySalt> Well, they did say it's meant to be an endgame system
[0:42:21] <DeltaPangaea> It really does.
[0:42:25] <+ArchimerCXV> my HUGEST concern with the helminth system is the death of a rework criteria, wher enow DE can point to an underwhelming frame and go 'maybe use helminth room!' and im here like "no please continue giving frames functional kits"
[0:42:40] <+OwlLightningMage> I really don't want to get Railjack resources for this system at all
[0:42:46] <+Apathiae> At least you don't have to keep farming them
[0:42:57] <DeltaPangaea> Like the sole point one could have besides 'grind more' for needing to gild zaws and kitguns
[0:43:07] <DeltaPangaea> Is if ungilged ones could be disassembled
[0:43:09] <RahnalH102> mmmm hammer
[0:43:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Fragor Prime is so much fun
[0:43:20] <DeltaPangaea> But they can't, so it's just grindmore kek
[0:43:23] <DensityD> 2 mill
[0:43:38] <Huntercd> Nothing beats crushing a skull with a big hammer
[0:43:48] <DensityD> argon spawns in the ass
[0:43:54] <cap_bon> Do your sorties and get your rivens...or ELSE
[0:44:29] <+ArchimerCXV> i think rivens were the last system i opposed day one and hell i still dont agree with it
[0:44:30] <Huntercd> Maroo's Ayatans?
[0:44:38] <+OwlLightningMage> I still can't believe they're giving out Roar
[0:44:57] <cap_bon> every single riven has been a pain to unlock and contained garbage :(
[0:45:15] <HorribleHog> I remember farming built forma in void tileset back in the day
[0:45:22] <HorribleHog> 1 guaranteed per day
[0:45:22] <+ArchimerCXV> and it fed a nasty randomroll statstick mafia
[0:45:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Rivens will always be the worst
[0:46:00] <+Creggamonsta> is warframe 3rd person Diablo 3?
[0:46:08] <HorribleHog> basically
[0:46:09] <TehMud> Outside of Prime missions yea
[0:46:11] <VroomSoon> Void capture is really good for relics
[0:46:12] <+Creggamonsta> i tried to get into but it never stuck
[0:46:31] <Just_Ori> I bring farming Nekros to a low lvl Void defense and can get 4-6 argon crystals
[0:46:31] <+Creggamonsta> warframe that is. i played a lot of d3
[0:46:37] <rcand9> this is the most wacky woohoo pizza looking gameplay
[0:47:01] <HorribleHog> enemies can drop argon
[0:47:22] <DeltaPangaea> I heard they backed off on giving Roar
[0:47:30] <+Basteksamplastek> another dread for collection
[0:47:41] <Huntercd> I wish the randomized stalker with the other versions. I have too many scythes and bows
[0:48:02] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no is your space kitty okay?
[0:48:30] <Huntercd> Vampire cats still too weak?
[0:48:37] <HorribleHog> I'd hope some good details so that Roar on, say, Valkyr would sound like her voice... But I doubt they'll do that.
[0:48:43] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm glad you don't have to stupid Pet stasis system anymore. Just switch them
[0:48:58] <+ArchimerCXV> @HorribleHog that is the most work for the least effect
[0:49:17] <Huntercd> Chonk pets
[0:49:22] <+Creggamonsta> no f the player. how dare they have fun
[0:49:26] <HorribleHog> Idk, I liked the pets spawning rationalized within the gameworld
[0:49:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> plagueGripes_TK
[0:49:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Pets also just need buffs in general
[0:49:49] <ScreamLord> Argon is so annoying to farm
[0:49:52] <+QuasartheHero> I like how 14 does Birbs
[0:50:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh it's ass
[0:50:30] <+OwlLightningMage> The Syndicate system is terrible
[0:51:04] <ScreamLord> Arbiter Tramp Stamp
[0:51:11] <RahnalH102> It's like the two main Shattrath reps for those that have played WoW, except 6
[0:51:18] <Huntercd> But why are they enemies? Why does Cressa Tal have beef with the space hippies?
[0:51:27] <+Creggamonsta> Syndicate the game?
[0:51:33] <+Creggamonsta> anyone rember that noise
[0:51:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> I think everyone hides them on the back, like maybe 2 of them even have cool designs
[0:51:56] <HorribleHog> Huntercd I could see that space hippie nazis don't like steel meridian because they're not pure humans
[0:51:58] <cap_bon> So many shitty half baked systems left by the way side.
[0:52:03] <TehMud> Yeah they never really touched Syndicates much
[0:52:06] <puse9> does Ordis even bave a mouth?
[0:52:16] <puse9> *have
[0:52:41] <ScreamLord> He used too
[0:52:41] <+OwlLightningMage> It's why I'm not excited for Mechs. They look cool, but new systems always LOOK cool until DE abandons them
[0:53:13] <+ArchimerCXV> for what it's worth, it's supposedly on their table of shit to rework 'when their plate is clear' which given they're about to launch their 3rd timesink open world
[0:53:29] <+ArchimerCXV> not likely
[0:53:52] <jasper_rouge> yeah need tabs for the syndicate sigils
[0:54:08] <puse9> like steel meridain and red Veil
[0:54:41] <TardigradeRex> Ever thought about becoming a game dev? :D
[0:54:51] <cap_bon> and the have the fucking nerve to send guys after during missions becuase fuck you
[0:54:55] <%Samex_Comex> Go butt bats seek my enemies
[0:55:02] <sasparillatango> dont set it on the character set it on the syndicate UI
[0:55:03] <+OwlLightningMage> As bad as the Syndicate affinity stuff is having missions where you need to collect those stupid medals is even worse
[0:55:47] <+OwlLightningMage> That would be much better LUL
[0:55:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> no eli, that would be logical, de doesn't do logic
[0:55:51] <+Sirsquizz> have that on the syndicate page
[0:56:00] <sasparillatango> run a "Champion" setting through the syndicate UI would be best ya
[0:56:01] <DensityD> layered
[0:56:01] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague fixing the game in 5 minutes
[0:56:02] <VroomSoon> No. You must set it on every single one. Sorry.

[0:56:47] <+Aleate> You don't have to tell us otzConcern
[0:56:52] <AncelDeLambert> the syndicate system needs an overhaul still, huh?
[0:56:52] <metalsiren31> Yee, and I cannot stress this enough, haw
[0:56:52] <AFlyingTaco1> No that is difficult Plague
[0:56:53] <heartlesshealer> Thanks for explaining syndicates for people who don't know you pick either 3 or the other 3
[0:56:55] <ha2ken> We space ninjas
[0:56:56] <$Valdorick> No, you gotta brand you frame.
[0:56:57] <faithless_zealot> Quiet*
[0:56:59] <KaiserMario> GOD, what frame is this?
[0:56:59] <+OwlLightningMage> You're super right Plague

[0:57:02] <mike2hands> we malding?
[0:57:09] <+NoMoreHero51> got sent here at the best time XD
[0:57:25] <EuropanLamprey> Raiding halfway into a Plague angery rant is super on brand
[0:57:25] <HorribleHog> Don't deal with Canada problems in Canada?
[0:57:27] <AFlyingTaco1> Are you in Canada now!?
[0:57:29] <de1ete_forever> what timeline did i stumble into?
[0:57:30] <dalishprince> 😔
[0:57:30] <+half_awake1> you're not wrong
[0:57:31] <+OwlLightningMage> DE needs to abandon more systems that people need to play the game
[0:57:34] <CalderGaming> [loud whispering] that's not something americans bother with either
[0:57:34] <heartlesshealer> Isn't Warframe Canadian?
[0:57:35] <+IncredibleMeh> america deals with C problems but then protends the A problems are features
[0:57:41] <+Demonstrandum> Warframe sure is a rich banquet of good stuff with some really stinky, vile turds sprinkled inbetween
[0:57:41] <+BubbaRands> boop
[0:57:43] <chhdez> "We'll just shoot our problems away"
[0:57:44] <aeronauticaljon> getting owned
[0:57:52] <gentlemanboxer> ON NO PAT'S CRACK
[0:57:59] <heartlesshealer> ah, argon farming
[0:58:01] <GeneralSCPatton> "Would you like a hard mode that makes everything into bullet sponges for +1% rewards instead?"
[0:58:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat doesn't care about this game anymore
[0:58:11] <AncelDeLambert> you should probably grab the guy before hunting argon
[0:58:18] <heartlesshealer> NO
[0:58:21] <AncelDeLambert> oh... UNprime
[0:58:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes best place to farm argon is Sabagtoge on the void t3 I think
[0:58:27] <AncelDeLambert> I uh... threw those out long ago
[0:58:29] <ScreamLord> "Soon" can be 2 years from now if Umbra is any clue
[0:58:30] <heartlesshealer> I am not feeding my frames I put fucking work into them
[0:58:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Roar for all.
[0:58:35] <+SinisterBroccoli> holy shit the bitrate dies on this game
[0:58:39] <Huntercd> Oh I like my lady frames tho
[0:58:40] <+ArchimerCXV> i can't tell you how hard i was laughing that they refused to say 'open world' so hard during the demo
[0:58:46] <xxshadowxx416> they all look like dicks
[0:58:49] <AFlyingTaco1> But I don't want to vore my Warframes
[0:58:51] <heartlesshealer> this sounds shortsighted
[0:58:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> join the club
[0:58:56] <AncelDeLambert> turn ANY frame into Oberon because we've given up!
[0:58:58] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited to give Roar to every Warframe LUL
[0:59:04] <AFlyingTaco1> Also that does sound fucking sick
[0:59:05] <+Aeoneth> I knew saving all my non primes would pay off one day
[0:59:11] <+doc_ock_rokc> oh no the meatballs
[0:59:18] <Dragonfighter46> Hehe another sistem that i won't be able to use
[0:59:19] <+BubbaRands> finally, hydroid has a 2 LUL
[0:59:22] <cap_bon> can I give energy vampire to any frame PogChamp
[0:59:24] <AncelDeLambert> did you get rid of your Ash because you finally grabbed a prime Ash? HAHA get fucked! - DE
[0:59:33] <Huntercd> You did side with space hippies
[0:59:35] <TardigradeRex> I hate to say it but we've got plenty of stuff like this in the software i'm working on at work where there are obvious quality of life upgrades that could be made but we're constantly working on stability issues/upgrades and the "ease of use" upgrades just get to take a back seat.
[0:59:39] <+OwlLightningMage> Valkyr is fucking dead since you can give Eternal War to other better Warframes
[0:59:42] <IntrepidEye> Trying to think of what ability to give to my rage Kitty
[0:59:51] <heartlesshealer> I usually just scrub the whole level
[0:59:53] <TGKodama> Valkyr spanks liches tho
[1:00:02] <heartlesshealer> Yeah those lip jumps suck
[1:00:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> I want that hydron prime
[1:00:03] <VroomSoon> Ledges LUL
[1:00:08] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh it's the fucking worst

[1:00:34] <DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[1:00:36] <+doc_ock_rokc> the target escaped
[1:00:36] <LunarRemix> Yeah you'd think they try to make everything super smooth so you can wallrun and jump everywhere
[1:00:38] <OldOnyx> Wow
[1:00:40] <+ArchimerCXV> thanks Jaun Gai
[1:00:40] <+D00msDayDan> oh yeah he'll totally bleed out if you leave him for too long
[1:00:43] <+OwlLightningMage> Someone killed the target LUL
[1:00:43] <+Demonstrandum> They might've gotten to run away. Incredible
[1:00:45] <Monkeyweed21> no one killed the target
[1:00:56] <Emperor_Machinus> psa1guy
[1:01:07] <OldOnyx> Thats only slightly less embarrassing
[1:01:07] <+Aeoneth> again?
[1:01:17] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I miss the old wall run animation where you ACTUALLY wall run instead of that dumb bunny hop you do now
[1:01:20] <Monkeyweed21> DE Pablo makes those ledges just to fuck with people
[1:01:25] <puse9> farm now rant later
[1:01:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> no thats SUPER old

[1:01:35] <IntrepidEye> Yeah I miss the old wall run. that was the shit
[1:01:39] <Monkeyweed21> you know you can disable those lines
[1:01:46] <cap_bon> is that just a normal ass vault
[1:01:47] <+BubbaRands> I love when everyone's down with ship shenanigans and sway in tandem LUL
[1:01:50] <TardigradeRex> Since 1993? LUL
[1:01:54] <OldOnyx> Thats an old line. I've hear it enough before turning op coms off
[1:01:56] <cap_bon> volt*
[1:01:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Do you have Keyface Plague?
[1:01:59] <silverlieutenant> At last catch one of this, Hi everyone, Hi plague, how is your day? LuvPeekR KonCha
[1:02:00] <Monkeyweed21> remember Stamina

[1:02:04] <+blistexthief> I miss Excalibur's super jump

[1:02:14] <OldOnyx> *heard
[1:02:16] <heartlesshealer> remember Artifacts?
[1:02:21] <Monkeyweed21> remember old melee
[1:02:22] <+realm_forge> Did you play it in a house? Did you play it with a mouse?
[1:02:32] <Monkeyweed21> remember void keys
[1:02:37] <YakumoYomi> I care
[1:02:46] <heartlesshealer> remember rainbow modding
[1:02:56] <+alpharius88> i played whe loki was a starter...
[1:03:10] <Monkeyweed21> the old wallrun sucked ass tho
[1:03:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Is Railjack still terrible?
[1:03:16] <cap_bon> The beta mod system was cursed
[1:03:19] <GarrisonWaifu> i do not miss coptering
[1:03:30] <+ArchimerCXV> I Miss DE modeling prime weapons after their house design and not the frame it's releasing with
[1:03:44] <ScreamLord> Remember when Warframe abilities were mods?
[1:03:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> mmmm mmm
[1:03:55] <+BubbaRands> mmmmmmm..... thicc
[1:03:56] <+alpharius88> railjack is a lot better but still needs work
[1:04:03] <+madtalon> I played over 100hrs of Waframe around two years ago and I didn't even get far. I was confused on how to get anywhere. I am kinda afraid to come back with all these new systems.
[1:04:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Railjack was so disappointing LUL
[1:04:30] <turbofolk> plague wheres your fat ass/Top heavy frames
[1:04:36] <+ArchimerCXV> you can describe a lot of current warframe with 'better but still needs work, no wait come back and finish making it'
[1:04:38] <heartlesshealer> that used to matter a little bit
[1:04:44] <+IncredibleMeh> tenno skoom bring stick of boom
[1:04:48] <TehMud> At least I can still run WF on my toaster despire all the upgrades
[1:04:55] <cap_bon> Stay close to the walls!
[1:04:57] <VroomSoon> box cutter man
[1:04:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Warframe looks more confusing than it actually is.
[1:05:01] <IntrepidEye> remember when you could parry EVERYTHING including explosions?
[1:05:02] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes yeah I remember starting out warframe was all stratagy then when you get to the end its all big number
[1:05:06] <$Valdorick> As a Limbo main, can confirm, that's all true
[1:05:07] <+OwlLightningMage> Limbo isn't even good food
[1:05:11] <cowardlord> I like limbo
[1:05:13] <Futurecity10> Limbo sucks
[1:05:16] <+UberWolfman> Zephyrs have no rights
[1:05:18] <LunarRemix> Stealth as a thing.
[1:05:21] <Monkeyweed21> cant wait to put banish on troll Loki
[1:05:29] <lemoan> used to be more focused on stealth didn't it?
[1:05:30] <OldOnyx> Loki used to be useful
[1:05:34] <heartlesshealer> I still play methodically when I'm playing solo and stealth around with a silent sniper weapon
[1:05:55] <heartlesshealer> bullet jumps used to not exist and you had to use the Dual Zoren bug
[1:05:58] <+StrudleBum> I love bullet jump, but I hate the new wall hopping, I miss old wall running
[1:06:10] <OldOnyx> Frost also had a purpose back then
[1:06:13] <%Samex_Comex> "No, boy stop, It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!"
[1:06:23] <Huntercd> Yeah that was hard for me
[1:06:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> mmmm
[1:06:27] <Monkeyweed21> the old wall run was fun but useless 99% of the time
[1:06:30] <AFlyingTaco1> Yeah I remember that shit, that was annoying
[1:06:38] <heartlesshealer> puzzle platforming was fun
[1:06:47] <+Sirsquizz> Loki was so much more useful at the time because of the old parkour system
[1:06:53] <+IncredibleMeh> have a hallway without any floors, bam
[1:07:00] <Monkeyweed21> Real players just coptered through everything @PlagueOfGripes
[1:07:04] <KaiserMario> "Oregon farming?"
[1:07:14] <+omegasis> I have the same sentiment but with monster hunter when comparing world and old-gen
[1:07:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Monkeyweed21 coptering is dead
[1:07:17] <TehMud> I do use Loki for Spy sometimes on specific tilesets but I generally know them well enough unless it's an underwater mission. I am terrible at Uranus missions and no its not a pun
[1:07:18] <+UberWolfman> Chad Ivara vs virgin Loki
[1:07:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Loki has one good power. He will be happy to get literally anything else
[1:07:29] <puse9> i also hate how argon decays
[1:07:42] <+Nomenanza> remember when this game was like "yo stealth tho"
[1:07:45] <ScreamLord> Argon, Cryonics, and a few other materials are a pain in the ass too farm
[1:07:56] <cap_bon> Is there a reason for Argon to decay besides "fuck you grind new resource hahaha"
[1:08:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> Loki is great stealth and support
[1:08:11] <TehMud> A nice little stasis thing for Argon would be nice
[1:08:14] <$Valdorick> "But you could just be ivara!"
[1:08:15] <LunarRemix> Meta ruins video games.
[1:08:19] <+IncredibleMeh> back in the day there weren a good crowd of special folk who didn't want bullet jumping because it would make coptering obsolete
[1:08:19] <heartlesshealer> I always liked Banshee
[1:08:21] <+BubbaRands> loki is spy missions
[1:08:22] <xxshadowxx416> but ash
[1:08:25] <Monkeyweed21> daily reminder that being invisible triples melee damage
[1:08:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> Banshee is the boss
[1:08:37] <AFlyingTaco1> I always go with Ivara for stealth
[1:08:40] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Loki Prime looks like a Devil Trigger for Vergil
[1:08:40] <RevenTheLight> Not Ivara?
[1:08:41] <LunarRemix> "It's not the very best option, why are you not playing the optimal way?!"
[1:08:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Eternal War Loki though
[1:08:49] <heartlesshealer> Ivara is current
[1:08:52] <OldOnyx> Ash can stealth nearly as well and can aslo kill things. Same with Ivara
[1:09:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> @ScreamLord if you have that one helmet that fans outwards yes
[1:09:15] <+AgniBrandt> Argon farming? I usually wait for an Orokin survival rift
[1:09:16] <+IncredibleMeh> optimal warframe is extremely boring
[1:09:29] <Monkeyweed21> shouldn't have ranted about ledges
[1:09:30] <+ArchimerCXV> @PlagueOfGripes it's been seven years and they're going in such a place where even the simplest of pleasures are getting lost and nothing i've done is really accounting for much
[1:09:34] <puse9> non meta weapons are really fun
[1:09:35] <Huntercd> I like doing spy missions slowly zipping through the level is boring to me
[1:09:43] <OldOnyx> problem is everything else Loki had aside from Invis aged like milk
[1:09:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> That was a thing for the fish one
[1:09:59] <Monkeyweed21> smeeta kavats can give you argon
[1:10:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> they removed it
[1:10:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague start suggesting good ideas
[1:10:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> it highlighted contaners
[1:10:23] <+arcielardor> hello plague!
[1:10:25] <cap_bon> remember when only one companion could hoover up shit
[1:10:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> Shrine hunting
[1:10:29] <+OwlLightningMage> That would be great
[1:10:30] <heartlesshealer> true, I don't even remember what Loki actually -does- aside from invisibility and I think disarming???
[1:10:37] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:10:42] <+Aeoneth> I would imagine the game doesn't know as it doesn't roll what the loot is until the container/Ai is destroyed
[1:10:48] <Monkeyweed21> the question is how would it prioritize it
[1:10:56] <OldOnyx> yeah, loki had disarm and teleport
[1:11:00] <+StrudleBum> it's the duct inside I think
[1:11:04] <+ArchimerCXV> DE has a real problem with things that help you scout stuff out because they have issue with people running (even more) braindead cause and i quote 'we're afraid people wont appreciate the tiles' (that we've all seen 4 billion times)
[1:11:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> @heartlesshealer switch teleport and decoy decoy is ueless but switch teleport is boss
[1:11:10] <Arweynn> base of the stairs then up
[1:11:10] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes 10 Argon is up there I bet
[1:11:10] <TehMud> Oh god I searched for Skulltulas for days as a kid
[1:11:18] <Emperor_Machinus> The hall way
[1:11:20] <OldOnyx> still does but they're useless in the current game
[1:11:27] <heartlesshealer> thanks @doc_ock_rokc
[1:11:33] <+StrudleBum> there's a duct at the staircase in that room , if I remember correctly
[1:11:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Replace Decoy with Roar for your theoretical teammates
[1:11:46] <+doc_ock_rokc> Limbo is good
[1:12:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> I also enjoy doing that with noise arrows and ivara
[1:12:25] <+OwlLightningMage> The freedom of doing nonoptimal things is fun
[1:12:30] <silverlieutenant> Frank was gonna retire next year NotLikeThi
[1:12:33] <puse9> i love how paranoid enemies getting killed by nothing
[1:12:33] <OldOnyx> I do that all the time whenever I run spy.. with ash
[1:12:39] <Monkeyweed21> you can do that with octavia
[1:12:53] <KaiserMario> I always enjoyed playing limbo, bending my back and going under the bar is really fun!
[1:12:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Octavia is so broken and no one cares LUL
[1:13:03] <LunarRemix> The Meta.
[1:13:04] <silverlieutenant> min-maxers
[1:13:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> I always like looking up weird ass builds in warframe
[1:13:12] <+Nomenanza> the game does promote big number tho
[1:13:14] <cap_bon> God imagine fighting an enemy thats 100% invisible and isnt an honour dipshit like the predator.
[1:13:15] <LunarRemix> Hate those kinds of players.
[1:13:20] <Mrbaconator> ignis prime might be my favorite weapon
[1:13:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> Fair
[1:13:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Actually most players hate being optimal.
[1:13:34] <heartlesshealer> Banshee's Silence is good for opening a room with stuns
[1:13:38] <VroomSoon> You must walk while invisible :)
[1:13:39] <Huntercd> It's her ass, its too phat
[1:13:48] <+billyhahalolxd> hi whats the best warframe to play
[1:13:57] <AFlyingTaco1> Exactly! I always play solo!
[1:13:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Whatever frame you want
[1:14:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> they failed
[1:14:01] <+Nomenanza> oh wow
[1:14:02] <silverlieutenant> its also kinda on the game, developer make its so people arent "Bored". balance gamplay!? that dosnt sell
[1:14:05] <+Nomenanza> and this is an easy one too
[1:14:15] <+IncredibleMeh> they betray their nubile nature
[1:14:22] <heartlesshealer> Ivara's better for the open world parts with her wire arrows
[1:14:38] <raveous> that's why you play on controller :P
[1:14:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she cute tho
[1:14:42] <OldOnyx> well everyone's getting stealth now since you can shoot invis arrow at your sentinel
[1:14:49] <+Fooguwu> Octavia is best stealth frame
[1:14:51] <+Demonstrandum> If you regard Warframes movement as one of it's biggest draws, then Ivara is just awful
[1:14:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes i always thought ivara should gecome more visible faster but if she stops she turns invisible
[1:14:56] <+StrudleBum> gotta rebind that roll man, screw the default sprint/roll
[1:14:56] <$Valdorick> "What about teabagging to the beat on Octavia!?"
[1:15:00] <puse9> is titania any fun?
[1:15:00] <Mrbaconator> best stream eli
[1:15:04] <Mrbaconator> you're doing great eli
[1:15:05] <KaiserMario> Who's Eli?
[1:15:10] <+Sirsquizz> wonderful stream eli
[1:15:10] <jasper_rouge> I made a nikana saw recently and just dashing around with the dash slash is great.
[1:15:12] <raveous> I really enjoy titania personally
[1:15:13] <cap_bon> Did they release any more Graxx skins because those skins are awesome
[1:15:19] <+yappy_water> you can mod her bow to be pretty good but her stealth is so eh
[1:15:22] <+Kenzo2000> Thanks Eli. Good stream
[1:15:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> Titania is fucking fun as hell
[1:15:23] <LunarRemix> Well Loki is ancient by now
[1:15:24] <Mrbaconator> any nerf to a warframes ass is a bad nerf
[1:15:31] <+billyhahalolxd> so whats the point of this game
[1:15:33] <snow_bush> Would you say its ArGone?
[1:15:33] <heartlesshealer> She's overpowered, but then lag
[1:15:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> Octavia is the best frame and thus nobody plays her
[1:15:42] <+FadingEmber> do you have steel path ? better argon drops
[1:15:44] <raveous> Mesa prime has a good ass
[1:15:45] <+Aeoneth> It's argonaot here
[1:15:50] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited for the Mechs to be disappointing like every new thing they add and don't fix
[1:15:58] <Huntercd> I kinda wish Ivara Prime didn't have jelly fish lingerie
[1:15:59] <Flamecap1> Concentrated Arrow
[1:15:59] <TheTakkster> I only ever had Nyx prime
[1:16:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> YEAH concentrated arrow!
[1:16:12] <heartlesshealer> the exploding arrow mods
[1:16:15] <+Fooguwu> I've mained octavia from day one, bought her cuz I loved her so much. I write a ton of music for her and everything
[1:16:16] <Emperor_Machinus> Valkyr is best stealth frame. Scream way into victory
[1:16:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Concentrated Arrow is fun but it drains all the energy
[1:16:20] <puse9> eidolon ivara seems to be a thing
[1:16:25] <CynosZilla> Go max efficiecy with her. :v
[1:16:27] <+Demonstrandum> It's so specific. Like, there's so many good explosion weapons
[1:16:34] <+StrudleBum> jellyfish butt though
[1:16:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Fun though
[1:16:45] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes ANother annoying thing is that you HAVE to wait for everyone else to get to the EVAC in order to leave a mission without loosing your loot. It's especially bad for infinite missions
[1:16:46] <+Aeoneth> I just like piloting her arrow
[1:16:51] <CynosZilla> however, max efficiency kills all her other skills, so...
[1:16:53] <+BubbaRands> hey! guys! Garuda's still fun...Right?
[1:16:56] <+Nomenanza> I see they redid the stat screen finally
[1:17:03] <LunarRemix> That's video games in a nutshell, fun but pointless
[1:17:07] <+UberWolfman> my friend somehow got 1800% accuracy
[1:17:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> My favorite build for saryn can be outclassed by 4 spam saryn
[1:17:08] <silverlieutenant> he, why all have our own kinks Kappa
[1:17:17] <cap_bon> The hell is parazon
[1:17:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Garuda isn't even fun. I want to like Garuda but she's too awkward to use
[1:17:26] <+FadingEmber> you can play wisp and jump everywhere
[1:17:38] <puse9> parazon is assassins creed blade
[1:17:41] <+realm_forge> He’s got them Tim Carrey legend horns
[1:17:42] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Did you try the new Well of Life? Its GREAT
[1:17:44] <Just_Ori> Molt > Decoy
[1:17:45] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm excited to give Loki literally anything else
[1:17:47] <+Nomenanza> I expected Garuda to be a new Valkyr but was disappointed to see it wasnt the case
[1:18:02] <+arcielardor> wisp was the first one I bought outright. fun as shit
[1:18:02] <+Demonstrandum> It's the greatest trolling ability
[1:18:03] <puse9> your Loki Prime looks amazing!
[1:18:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> Decoy-switch teleport
[1:18:11] <VroomSoon> griefing team members
[1:18:12] <+OwlLightningMage> You can give Garuda Eternal War now
[1:18:12] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> switch with someone on a dargy to be a troll
[1:18:15] <Apolonm> Swith teleport pre nerf was awesome
[1:18:19] <silverlieutenant> hey, there is always that one person that somehowmake the dumbest skill work, at least in a trll way LUL
[1:18:19] <brainstrainz> my only loki build was for speed and mobility before gauss came out, hes just so outdated nowadays
[1:18:29] <silverlieutenant> Troll*
[1:18:30] <Apolonm> such troll ability
[1:18:33] <raveous> so you're saying there should be a Loki rework
[1:18:38] <heartlesshealer> switch places with Zephyr mid-air
[1:18:38] <DisGuyOvahEre> hey plague i stopped playing warframe cause it was really grindy, now im really bored of what im currently playing and need a single player game. is it still a grind?
[1:18:40] <GarrisonWaifu> switch teleport the defense target outside the map
[1:18:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> Loki teleporting Demolists used to be a thing
[1:18:43] <+Demonstrandum> You can bypass Spy lasers with switching with your decoy, but that's so fringe
[1:18:48] <cap_bon> So is this new deimos thing just giving skills to a different frame
[1:18:56] <raveous> Warframe is literally THE grind
[1:18:59] <Sunstalker> Mesa does it better
[1:19:03] <+StrudleBum> can't remember last time I had to use radial disarm since the raid got removed
[1:19:04] <CalderGaming> Loki was one of the first 3 warframes and BOY does he need an update
[1:19:05] <Twoiis> Kinda miss the game. it's been awhile for me.
[1:19:06] <CynosZilla> an people still call Loki the best stealth frame in the game. :v
[1:19:10] <heartlesshealer> Cowboy Limbo
[1:19:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> BLOODBORN!
[1:19:11] <+krimbisch> Pissing off your teamates is a limbo specialty
[1:19:13] <+Aeoneth> Why does your Limbo look like a Mesa
[1:19:18] <MilkingEdge> BLOOOOOD
[1:19:20] <+Fooguwu> it's batman
[1:19:20] <+burgerdicks> It's 12 pm, did I get it right?
[1:19:21] <heartlesshealer> TEAMS HATE LIMBO
[1:19:23] <VroomSoon> Honest work
[1:19:35] <+LittleBigQuebec> he's also good at making your team angry
[1:19:42] <+krimbisch> There was time i legit quit if i saw anyone playing limbo
[1:19:59] <+BubbaRands> I don't hate Limbo,I just hate people who can't play limbo good.
[1:20:00] <+OwlLightningMage> To be fair, Rift Search Limbo is pretty fun on you're own
[1:20:01] <+Demonstrandum> You can type in the faction name to find available ones, I think
[1:20:14] <+D00msDayDan> i just search by the percentage
[1:20:18] <+krimbisch> An ability that stops teamates from playing is awful
[1:20:20] <AFlyingTaco1> No shut up that's hard
[1:20:21] <silverlieutenant> ALL THE EDGE! nicobYareYare
[1:20:27] <Sunstalker> Wouldn't it be nice if you could equip any of them and just get the bonus of the highest one? vadeSmile
[1:20:31] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes That's stupid Eli. Why would ANYONE do it like that?
[1:20:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Syndicates suck ass. Collecting medals suck ass
[1:20:57] <heartlesshealer> you gotta get all up in enemy asses to steal energy
[1:21:00] <Andele1503> Its "Roll or use the augment"
[1:21:03] <Sunstalker> I roll everywhere. vadeLUL It does suck though
[1:21:04] <laserbeaming> Ivara, the Stealthy Tumbleweed
[1:21:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Rolling isn't a good way to move around
[1:21:26] <silverlieutenant> you cant use to wisch ON and OFF? that is bad desing
[1:21:27] <MilkingEdge> SPIN2WIN
[1:21:29] <heartlesshealer> Rolling is shit! I gave that up in Ocarina of Time
[1:21:33] <silverlieutenant> switch*
[1:21:38] <puse9> its better to zip around
[1:21:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague is super right LUL
[1:21:43] <+krimbisch> I personally like the invis to be invincible on survival when i last played it was possible for it to last like 10 mins
[1:22:00] <+FadingEmber> I mean do we need vacuum modes?
[1:22:15] <+OwlLightningMage> No they wouldn't Plague
[1:22:21] <DisGuyOvahEre> anyone who uses forums regularly are stupid
[1:22:24] <heartlesshealer> NotLikeThis
[1:22:24] <+BubbaRands> Mesa's butt was SSS priority at the time tho LUL
[1:22:25] <laserbeaming> What would you do then, to make it so Ivara doesn't invalidate Loki?
[1:22:31] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> NotLikeThis
[1:22:33] <puse9> those guys are fuckin elitists
[1:22:33] <silverlieutenant> NO IT WONT! LUL SKINS ar the priorities, lets be real here nicobBang
[1:22:37] <Sunstalker> It's not fair if other people dont have to suffer what I had to suffer, Plauge vadeRee /s
[1:22:37] <Andele1503> If anything a nice chunk of them need to be buffed
[1:22:43] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 11 months! Give big damage.
[1:22:45] <$Valdorick> I like the offical fourm threads of "I stay at MR 4 for the memes and prove how skilled I am, but I'm locked out of this new system!"
[1:22:51] <DisGuyOvahEre> elitists use broken weapons and frames, not asking for nerfs
[1:22:51] <Sunstalker> Stat sticks are garbage designs
[1:22:54] <cowardlord> Limbo is cool
[1:22:55] <+Demonstrandum> From what I understand of DE's company culture there are some people who are really dug into their opinions about certain systems and have enough "influence" to stop things from changing
[1:22:59] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Warframe is a PVE game. Why shouldn't you be over powered?
[1:23:02] <+IncredibleMeh> radical idea here, absolutely crazy but hear me out, what if when helminth abilites are OP you just nerf helminth
[1:23:12] <puse9> i prefer a fun warframe then a meta one
[1:23:23] <heartlesshealer> it's PvE, why
[1:23:28] <Andele1503> I mean, atlas has around 68% of khoras damage, its just actually range limited
[1:23:29] <Shardlab> Overwatch mentality
[1:23:30] <+FadingEmber> Nyx is fine if you use mind freak Kappa
[1:23:34] <Apolonm> Vauban is overpowered
[1:23:34] <heartlesshealer> argon get
[1:23:46] <silverlieutenant> Man, For this all is why i stop playuing any Online game, no worth the hassle, single player for me! PrideLaugh
[1:23:48] <+LittleBigQuebec> meanwhile i'm just happy Excal can get warcry to replace radial blind
[1:23:48] <cap_bon> Just let any frame have any skill fuck it just go nuts and full fashion frame
[1:23:49] <+StrudleBum> they deserve it
[1:23:55] <DisGuyOvahEre> no joke i prefer hearing you complain than playing games and having to study meta whats your stream schedule
[1:23:59] <puse9> someone even wanted to make another guy quit because he uses grendel
[1:24:03] <ScreamLord> Eli farts his way through the solar system
[1:24:11] <Sunstalker> ignis was a mistake vadeMald Just see people vacuum flamethrower very box in the level, not moving along
[1:24:11] <OldOnyx> Meh, Gas was pretty decent before the status overhaul. Shit now though
[1:24:13] <+OwlLightningMage> Grendel is fun though
[1:24:13] <+Fooguwu> limbo
[1:24:16] <laserbeaming> You mean Limbo?
[1:24:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> fair
[1:24:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> LIMBO
[1:24:27] <heartlesshealer> blue star get
[1:24:29] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Limbo dude, not Loki
[1:24:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> Limbo is....okay
[1:24:32] <CynosZilla> Loki is a frame that you play when you don't want anyone elso to play.
[1:24:32] <ECRead> he means limbo ya
[1:24:35] <+burgerdicks> why is loki good at opening crates?
[1:24:36] <+Fooguwu> over and over
[1:24:39] <+Fooguwu> lol
[1:24:39] <CynosZilla> dang it! LIMBO!
[1:24:41] <%Samex_Comex> Everybody Limbo

[1:24:52] <+FadingEmber> Its okay everyone hate Loki
[1:24:52] <silverlieutenant> You really Hate the word "Loki" LUL
[1:24:53] <heartlesshealer> Limbo Prime
[1:24:56] <+OwlLightningMage> Laku
[1:24:56] <$Valdorick> Limbo Main - you just build range to max and open boxes. You're alerady meta, Plague.
[1:24:58] <heartlesshealer> you'll see it
[1:25:04] <VroomSoon> new frame: Ligma
[1:25:06] <Andele1503> @FadingEmber fun fact, in 1 and a half minutes a mind freak heavy attack redeemer fueled steel path heavy gunner cant kill another heavy gunner

[1:25:08] <puse9> like laku?
[1:25:14] <DisGuyOvahEre> doesnt like loki and limbo has lokilimbo prime
[1:25:14] <usotaku013666> Sup nerds? How goes it?
[1:25:16] <+burgerdicks> Introducing the new frame, Latass
[1:25:22] <+MegaCorpltd> Next Warframe Ligma confirmed
[1:25:22] <ECRead> YEEEEEEEEEEEEAH
[1:25:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> Ligma another Engineer frame?
[1:25:33] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> "oh that's just old Eli, he rants about loki opening boxes, but he means limbo"
[1:25:33] <+Fooguwu> efficiency makes me hot
[1:25:35] <+OwlLightningMage> He's so good at opening boxes
[1:25:39] <+D00msDayDan> limboki
[1:25:39] <Luizabd> Is he really just a box opener?
[1:25:42] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:25:48] <jbrachob> lOMBO
[1:25:49] <+FadingEmber> @Andele1503 Yes. I also watched Brozime test that on stream LUL
[1:25:50] <Sunstalker> What if we just had no boxes and put all the resources inside the enemies and mission rewards? vadeHm
[1:25:50] <+Senotaki> Lokimbo?
[1:25:51] <Badpest> Badpest subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:25:55] <IamGrapes> damn Lumba open dem boxes
[1:25:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> LIMBKI
[1:25:59] <TehMud> Let us not forget old Vaunban bounce houses
[1:25:59] <Luizabd> He looked like a cool cowboy guy
[1:26:00] <+burgerdicks> What boxes is he talking about?
[1:26:02] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Limboki is a beast on Christmas morning
[1:26:06] <+IncredibleMeh> can you reach it before the other person kills it though?
[1:26:07] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PlagueOfGripes TBH , all of limbo's kit exists to make your team angry if you don't build to open crates
[1:26:10] <Coldfoxvii> The hell kind of rant did I walk into?
[1:26:12] <+burgerdicks> relics?
[1:26:12] <LunarRemix> Banish.
[1:26:21] <+Demonstrandum> Switches people into the other dimension
[1:26:22] <laserbeaming> Limbo's 1 will put people in the Limbo Realms
[1:26:22] <+doc_ock_rokc> Banishes them to your SAFE SPACE
[1:26:23] <silverlieutenant> Open 3 boxes in 1.5 seconds! LUL
[1:26:26] <+StrudleBum> kicks them into the timeout zone
[1:26:27] <LunarRemix> And that's his helmith ability lol
[1:26:31] <+krimbisch> I really am lost loki or limbo?
[1:26:50] <Sunstalker> 'Loki's' 1 is You Can't Touch this
[1:26:51] <CalderGaming> Now thinking about Limbo in a hi-vis jacket and hard hat working in a shipping/receiving department
[1:26:51] <OldOnyx> Corrosive, Viral, Radiation, and Gas, all had a place before the status rework. Now it's mostly Viral/Slash hybrid builds on everything
[1:26:54] <Coldfoxvii> FortBush
[1:26:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> For real they need to make it so that people in the limbo world are more visibly in it
[1:26:56] <ScreamLord> Loboki banishes them Into the shame dimension
[1:26:56] <IntrepidEye> You still have Operator voices on?
[1:26:56] <Andele1503> @FadingEmber oh i didnt mean the cheaty tests with cat and mind bullets helping with regular gunners, i mean actual steel path earth gunner vs earth gunner
[1:27:01] <silverlieutenant> well, someone has to take it seriously LUL
[1:27:07] <$Valdorick> Yes
[1:27:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> YES
[1:27:11] <heartlesshealer> yes
[1:27:14] <ScreamLord> Shame on you
[1:27:15] <cowardlord> AWWWW
[1:27:18] <OldOnyx> and innate slash on a weapon is worthless now unless it's 90% of the profile
[1:27:18] <Zombrocom> Hi, Hello limbo main here
[1:27:19] <+OwlLightningMage> Limbo is fun though LUL
[1:27:22] <Treuan> I know what his 4 does, that's enough for me
[1:27:22] <cap_bon> Limbo is sit in bubble and cast stop time then profit
[1:27:23] <+StrudleBum> Limbo is the Excavation frame :P you use him for steelpath easy excavation
[1:27:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> It can do some shit
[1:27:27] <Andele1503> I mean i do, its just boring-ish
[1:27:27] <$Valdorick> You hit 2, then 4, then 3, then 4 again, then you walk away and laugh at your team.
[1:27:30] <+Senotaki> I love Limbo, but his 1 is useless.
[1:27:30] <Treuan> He's a more complicated frost
[1:27:31] <CynosZilla> Limbo open crates. That is his job
[1:27:33] <sasparillatango> press 4 press 2, sit on top of defense objectives
[1:27:34] <+OwlLightningMage> Every Warframe is fun LUL
[1:27:34] <sasparillatango> solved
[1:27:38] <+burgerdicks> Limbo's kit go brrr -Digital Extremes
[1:27:41] <+FadingEmber> @Andele1503 thats even worse LUL
[1:27:49] <Relinfearous> Isn't Mankind a pro wrestler?
[1:27:52] <+Birdigalore> WE are all Mankey inside
[1:27:54] <%Badpest> No one knows
[1:27:56] <deepFr0sty> DE don't even understand how Limboki works.
[1:27:57] <Andele1503> his 1 is yeet enemies into space, 2 is stop enemy from shooting, 3 is re-yeet enemies into space, 4 is make space bubble
[1:28:02] <Zombrocom> You don't use his 1, you just put down cataclysm and stop time, and trivilize every mission
[1:28:06] <sasparillatango> operator ability
[1:28:08] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> didn't they nerf limbo recently so he went from kinda good to bad?
[1:28:09] <silverlieutenant> just label him "The OC of one of the developers" LUL
[1:28:19] <+StrudleBum> those were hell before bullet jump
[1:28:24] <+IncredibleMeh> monkey make rock to break more rock to make better rock
[1:28:28] <Zombrocom> Limbo is literally one of, if not the most OP warframe in the game
[1:28:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Limbo is fine. it's just a meme to hate him
[1:28:30] <+doc_ock_rokc> @KosOrSomeSayKosm_ no he is just niche as ehll
[1:28:30] <Huntercd> Really? Like shitty pinatas?
[1:28:32] <$Valdorick> Yeah, they reduced his statis duration in half and keep adding enemies that just ignore rift.
[1:28:37] <Sunstalker> The magician frame. What does he? Timestop. Is that all? Yes. vadeSmile
[1:28:43] <MilkingEdge> 2 argon
[1:28:53] <LunarRemix> Isn't Frost good on defense and excavation?
[1:29:01] <+FadingEmber> Frost and Nyx are in their own special tier
[1:29:05] <+OwlLightningMage> For real though, no jokes, Nyx is hands down the worst Warframe
[1:29:06] <Sunstalker> its right there
[1:29:07] <+doc_ock_rokc> I still like doing the "Rift surge crowd control" thing on my low duration loki
[1:29:08] <Sunstalker> at the corner
[1:29:10] <$Valdorick> Yeah, but Limbo is better
[1:29:11] <+valiard> how do younprep for deimos?
[1:29:12] <Emperor_Machinus> Cat gift?
[1:29:17] <$Valdorick> so Frost doesn't even have that going for him
[1:29:19] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Frost Prime is such a joke design. They just took Frost and put a bird cage on his head. LUL
[1:29:20] <xxshadowxx416> you know how the hard frame rhino
[1:29:30] <OldOnyx> @LunarRemix Nowhere near as good as Gara
[1:29:34] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @doc_ock_rokc that is also true
[1:29:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Collecting medallions is the worsr
[1:29:44] <Zombrocom> Nyx is actually great at steel path because 100% armour strip + Invincibility
[1:29:48] <$Valdorick> And yeah, Gara is just infintely better Frost
[1:29:49] <+StrudleBum> Limbo has 2 uses, opening crates, and total enemy lockdown on non-corpus missions
[1:29:50] <laserbeaming> can't medallions spawn any place where a crate can spawn?
[1:29:52] <%Badpest> Oh god no... I know what you mean
[1:29:52] <heartlesshealer> YEAH
[1:29:54] <CalderGaming> AUGH I HATE THAT ONE
[1:29:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> I FUCKING HATE THAT
[1:29:59] <cap_bon> wait for that heart of deimos shit im gonna have to get a nidus just to get in that room again.
[1:30:00] <%Badpest> That's 100% bullshit
[1:30:06] <Treuan> Ugh medallions
[1:30:13] <Sunstalker> They can spanwn inside the blue orbs too to scan @PlagueOfGripes
[1:30:24] <laserbeaming> I don't even do sindacate mission, but I'm mad at that medallion
[1:30:25] <Andele1503> Ah, the earth and lua tileset
[1:30:25] <+OwlLightningMage> They need to get rid of finding medallions
[1:30:25] <+Demonstrandum> There's some absolute bullshit medallion locations
[1:30:27] <+doc_ock_rokc> NO
[1:30:35] <ScreamLord> Amazing
[1:30:40] <Sunstalker> harka
[1:30:41] <heartlesshealer> everything and its grandma having knockback is silly though
[1:30:49] <Zombrocom> Harka is great
[1:30:54] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:30:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> It is sexy
[1:30:58] <+FadingEmber> the demon looking one?
[1:31:02] <+UberWolfman> I also use his prime because he was a free
[1:31:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Frost isn't bad, there's just very little reason to ever use him
[1:31:12] <Sunstalker> It's great because it looks like he's wearing a fuckboi dress with a low cut. vadeLewd
[1:31:13] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a lotta weewee
[1:31:26] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[1:31:27] <LunarRemix> I thought he was good at excavation and defense
[1:31:28] <%Samex_Comex> Okay?
[1:31:33] <+IncredibleMeh> wow I'm one of every man in the world
[1:31:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> Im saving my plat for that Hydroid Deluxe skin. Mostly so I can have that FUCKING COAT
[1:31:40] <$Valdorick> He craves the frozen jizz
[1:31:41] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> labase1Skepdick
[1:31:41] <+D00msDayDan> are all your warframe streams this good?
[1:31:43] <Zooperton> impressive
[1:31:50] <+OwlLightningMage> Frost is arguably the best at excavation, that's about it
[1:31:53] <+Herbpudding> this is pog content glad I tuned in
[1:31:57] <Coldfoxvii> An amazing duck tape and Popsicle stick sculpture
[1:31:57] <OldOnyx> Frost can't even do that anymore because he lost his mouth
[1:31:59] <DoostCola> titania best frame
[1:32:00] <Andele1503> What Owl Lightning Mage said, hypothetically decent, no use right now (his 1 damage and 4 aug need to be buffed really hard)
[1:32:05] <+StrudleBum> Frost eats ass
[1:32:06] <$Valdorick> He craves the frozen puss
[1:32:07] <laserbeaming> The subbiest frame
[1:32:21] <Puhff> now THAT'S what I call inclusivity!
[1:32:22] <$Valdorick> Frost - Tags: water play
[1:32:30] <+Demonstrandum> I like frost with range for aoe damage. Unfortunately for bubble to be good you need low range, which is lame
[1:32:31] <heartlesshealer> like Nidus
[1:32:33] <YakumoYomi> Someone has to stimulate those clitorises (clitorii?)
[1:32:36] <Sunstalker> He makes his egg ovulate and all the enemies try to get at it like little sperms
[1:32:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> peenor AND bogania? wow
[1:32:40] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes People are still butthurt that Excalibur Prime is unavailable and the few founders that have him are butthurt at them for wanting it. Excal P looks even worse than Frost P they just glued a voide key to his face
[1:32:44] <+MegaCorpltd> Rock hard alien nipples
[1:32:46] <CyberDingus> zentreWOAH Alien what?
[1:32:49] <lockhead45> Okay this was the best moment to join in confirmed
[1:32:49] <laserbeaming> 193 Crates Opened
[1:32:53] <Puhff> little a alien genital, as a treat
[1:32:56] <CynosZilla> There are no bad frames. Only useless ones. :v
[1:33:00] <+OwlLightningMage> Gara and ironically Limbo are better at protecting a single defense point
[1:33:00] <%Samex_Comex> My floobflabber?
[1:33:07] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PlagueOfGripes what about deffection
[1:33:07] <Zombrocom> Everyone stopped giving a shit about excal prime when umbra happened
[1:33:11] <laserbeaming> Gara is Better Frost
[1:33:13] <IamGrapes> sounds like Frost is the frame for me then. i wanna get my genitiles serviced
[1:33:25] <+Kenzo2000> it was 193 crates
[1:33:32] <OldOnyx> and even if he could, who wants a cold blowjob? I ask you that
[1:33:34] <cap_bon> excavation is why I dont have trinity prime
[1:33:36] <+StrudleBum> Defection? more like Defecation amirite LUL
[1:33:36] <heartlesshealer> interception... >:
[1:33:43] <$Valdorick> No Gapes, frost is only servicing, he never gets to complete.
[1:33:47] <Zombrocom> Nova makes solo interception pretty breezy
[1:33:53] <+doc_ock_rokc> Umbra is cooler anyway
[1:34:00] <+Demonstrandum> Mobile Defense is so much fun
[1:34:02] <Treuan> intercept is the worst
[1:34:11] <TheAsylumCat> archwing missions drive me up the wall
[1:34:14] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PlagueOfGripes i find that a well cordinated team team with a good genital licker can grind relics super fast in excavation
[1:34:16] <Zebroneath> Isn't there an Excalibur Umbra Prime?
[1:34:19] <Sunstalker> Primed Chamber rereleasing and people crying over it was hilarious vadeLaugh
[1:34:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes actually Barro now sells the loatus Ephemera
[1:34:22] <laserbeaming> no systems
[1:34:22] <Andele1503> Disruption? Disruption is one of the best game modes, its just shit in steel path because of badly designed DR, what is pure shit are interception and defection (the escort one)
[1:34:23] <heartlesshealer> circuits
[1:34:26] <DoostCola> it has been years and i STILL dont have Ivara
[1:34:29] <+Sirsquizz> missing systems
[1:34:30] <laserbeaming> TIME TO DO VAY HEK
[1:34:34] <heartlesshealer> gotta farm for hydroid systems
[1:34:36] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> SYSTEMS
[1:34:37] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm building a Nidus right now just so I can put Larva on everything
[1:34:42] <+Apathiae> Having Excal P, he does indeed look like shit
[1:34:42] <+UberWolfman> OH BOY VEY HEK RUNS
[1:34:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh YEAH, time for SCREAMY BOI
[1:34:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> @DoostCola I'll help you get one I got most of her prime parts
[1:34:45] <Zombrocom> VAY HEK TIME OH BOY
[1:34:45] <$Valdorick> HEK
[1:34:46] <heartlesshealer> ENJOY
[1:34:47] <laserbeaming> Time to breathe Vay Hek's Air!

[1:34:54] <CalderGaming> make the parts now so you don't waste the argon...
[1:34:54] <MilkingEdge> build the parts
[1:34:55] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[1:34:58] <ECRead> MY AIR
[1:35:04] <heartlesshealer> Reasons I've never built Hydroid to this day
[1:35:04] <cap_bon> acutal star chart boss grind LUL
[1:35:04] <+StrudleBum> lol
[1:35:05] <CalderGaming> TIME FOR PAT
[1:35:06] <+valiard> Come on MAGGOT
[1:35:06] <+UberWolfman> BREATH HIS AIR
[1:35:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Why are you building Hydroid? Why do you tempest barrage? LUL
[1:35:07] <sinbad2058> hek hek hek
[1:35:08] <anon_1307> one shot him with chroma
[1:35:10] <+Demonstrandum> You probably know this, but you can skip all teh Vey Hek phases and just go to the end
[1:35:12] <boredlands> NOT PURE!
[1:35:14] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Need help?
[1:35:18] <Sunstalker> Remember how shit Alerts were? I got a Vauban Prime together before I got a regular one built despite joining back when Ash Prime was new.
[1:35:20] <KaiserMario> That's the correct sound
[1:35:21] <heartlesshealer> LUL
[1:35:21] <Slim_Lipid> Just like the good ol' days
[1:35:23] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm skipping Hydroid for now
[1:35:28] <Treuan> Worst assassination target or second worst?
[1:35:40] <heartlesshealer> mostly weapons I think
[1:35:41] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah fuck Hildryn and Baruuk
[1:35:42] <laserbeaming> Wanna do Steel Path Vay Hek?
[1:35:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> He is easy
[1:35:49] <+FadingEmber> How many frames is he farming?
[1:35:50] <mellorolo> what? want a hacked-in item?
[1:35:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Getting Hildryn is worse
[1:36:09] <YakumoYomi> Ah, the struggles of trying to build normal Booben...
[1:36:18] <+OwlLightningMage> You have to do arguably the worst boss fight in the game
[1:36:20] <heartlesshealer> she needs mining
[1:36:21] <laserbeaming> those toroids are not that hard to farm
[1:36:22] <cap_bon> Can you explain how deimos is gonna work
[1:36:41] <heartlesshealer> you can build wisp now
[1:36:43] <CalderGaming> same, but I make an exception for argon parts
[1:36:44] <heartlesshealer> Extractors
[1:36:45] <+Sirsquizz> extractors

[1:38:25] <+Demonstrandum> C what you made me do

[1:38:27] <Ekaelis> Halikar is Grineer weapon, right?

[1:45:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> Just because Space mom has started dating again doesn't mean she doesn't love you
[1:45:05] <Splash1029> yo im still new to the game what warframes should i get?
[1:45:06] <Emperor_Machinus> double wukong
[1:45:09] <Sunstalker> Warframe lore is just drunk devs throwing darts
[1:45:27] <ScreamLord> Excalibur's a solid frame
[1:45:34] <DisGuyOvahEre> it looks like a pterodactyl and a pelican from halo had an aborted child
[1:45:35] <$Valdorick> Then you ride him like a bull into the bugzapper
[1:45:37] <+doc_ock_rokc> @Splash1029 Volt is a good early frame to get
[1:45:39] <laserbeaming> You need to use your amp to damage his shield
[1:45:41] <+Herbpudding> what is the checklist for deimos?
[1:45:41] <laserbeaming> I think
[1:45:48] <Zombrocom> Operator , pop it shields, ride him into it
[1:45:48] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes Operator to get rid of shield
[1:45:54] <+OwlLightningMage> I was grinding Nidus yesterday and actually found people in the mission doing the same thing
[1:45:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Battling the mighty Ropopalips
[1:46:00] <$Valdorick> You have him beam the bug zapper first, then mount him
[1:46:02] <OldOnyx> ah, wukong makes this fight trivial af
[1:46:18] <+LittleBigQuebec> this fucker has operatpr sheilds
[1:46:22] <Splash1029> @doc_ock_rokc any other reccomendations?
[1:46:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nope you have to hurt them first
[1:46:24] <Goergorion> damage then botton
[1:46:26] <Zombrocom> Break thing
[1:46:27] <laserbeaming> you have to hit its weak points?

[1:51:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> What the fuck is this UI suddenly
[1:51:13] <Zombrocom> It's 1 in 4, so it will take 20 tries
[1:51:14] <Sloavon> :) that sounds fun
[1:51:17] <xxshadowxx416> do you buy wise blueprint
[1:51:18] <Zebroneath> Wouldn't be Warframe if that wasn't the case
[1:51:23] <Andele1503> ah yus boss
[1:51:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> wait you're farming wisp?
[1:51:36] <%Samex_Comex> I did not know there was bosses I thought you just flew through corridors in this game
[1:51:44] <fruit_pie_the_magician> wisp is so fucking broken
[1:51:48] <CynosZilla> alright. Didn't know that.
[1:51:48] <Treuan> Gotta check the list twice
[1:51:50] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes DE has some of the most bullshit, gobbledygook names for stuff I've ever seen. Final Fantasy has nothing on Warframe
[1:51:54] <$Metal_Slime_King> 22.5% chance means you need to do it 20 times before it drops in Warframe
[1:51:59] <Goergorion> when do we factory reset mom?
[1:52:04] <Paralurx> "Why was I programmed to be depressed?!"
[1:52:06] <YakumoYomi> Bitch eggs?

[1:52:34] <AFlyingTaco1> Wait which frame is Plague using right now?
[1:52:36] <$JobbedBone> my ears BibleThump
[1:52:44] <afronooch> My rope-a HNG -lopies
[1:52:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Wisps weird hovering garbage is hilarious to abuse, especially with the telos boltace
[1:52:45] <Zombrocom> Plague is playing wukong
[1:52:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> Someone send space mom to space theropy
[1:52:53] <DisGuyOvahEre> MOAs are cool i want one in game that isn't a hologram
[1:52:53] <$Valdorick> NEXT BIT
[1:52:53] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes A warframe with a big ass is your goal
[1:52:56] <Paralurx> Forgetting what's going on, focusing too hard on ropalopeys
[1:53:03] <Carnadan> why are you so fast dang
[1:53:05] <$JobbedBone> this is a dark future
[1:53:11] <xxshadowxx416> wukong not did not need a rework
[1:53:19] <Sloavon> Reminds me of Cortana in Halo 3
[1:53:22] <ScreamLord> The Ropest
[1:53:23] <Nickdick96> Turgid Passion Play
[1:53:40] <Paralurx> The legendary ropalopey?! But it's said that he only appears once every 1000 years!
[1:53:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> wukong used to be stupid
[1:53:55] <Treuan> I want to see Alad's turgid monster
[1:54:03] <+LittleBigQuebec> Eli you might ass well make all 3 lamps open at first, they stay open for the rest of the fight
[1:54:05] <fruit_pie_the_magician> stupid and boring, unless you abused the iron vault shit
[1:54:13] <Zombrocom> BONK
[1:54:14] <xxshadowxx416> wukong used to be immunity
[1:54:38] <ScreamLord> I remember one Prime Operator outfir that makes you look like Voldo from Soul Calibur
[1:54:38] <+LittleBigQuebec> he was doing it earlier
[1:54:40] <boredlands> "Sorry, i cant come to work today. Caught a bad case of the ropaloids"
[1:54:42] <chainedwolfstress> He finished, I believe.
[1:54:42] <@PeachSaliva> Oh! Shit that’s now? Crap
[1:54:46] <Zombrocom> New wukong is so much better than old wukong
[1:54:50] <+UberWolfman> That was earlier
[1:54:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I thought you were talking about Bob Ross
[1:54:56] <@PeachSaliva> Ah yeah. I figured we should look into it
[1:54:58] <@PeachSaliva> Ah sorry
[1:54:58] <+LittleBigQuebec> @PeachSaliva you actually missed it
[1:55:00] <afronooch> they've been done for a little while
[1:55:04] <$Valdorick> Alad's zanuka project getting invested into by the Ropalopes
[1:55:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Yes, Bob Ross LUL
[1:55:07] <+Demonstrandum> Man, I forgot how fun Plague streams are. Good shit, good shit
[1:55:08] <Jazz_Cannon> Bob Ross or Rubber Ninja? I don't know any other rosses?
[1:55:10] <@PeachSaliva> Well balls @littlebigquebec I’ll catch it on YT
[1:55:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Rubber Ross
[1:55:21] <ZComiX> which Ross?
[1:55:24] <Jazz_Cannon> Ross Geller?
[1:55:27] <+LittleBigQuebec> i'll probably do the same because VInny was in it
[1:55:27] <@PeachSaliva> @demonstrandum he’s the best!
[1:55:31] <Paralurx> Ross from Friends?
[1:55:32] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> alot of good rosses
[1:55:36] <Sloavon> ross from game grumps?
[1:55:40] <+OwlLightningMage> yes
[1:55:41] <$Valdorick> Ross from Game Grumps, yes.
[1:55:50] <+RenoDeGeneric> The word Turgid is bad change my mind
[1:55:52] <Zombrocom> No one has killed his synoviaS
[1:56:04] <Jazz_Cannon> what if Bob Ross, Rubber Ninja, Ross from Friends and Ross from Game Grumps all played a survival horror?
[1:56:11] <+Demonstrandum> @PeachSaliva I like you and Pat quite a bit as well. Unfortuately timezones make catching streams live and interacting in chat quite difficult.
[1:56:14] <+eanscrale> If only !
[1:56:16] <+walternatorz> is this an attempt to unload Paige?
[1:56:17] <Zombrocom> Someone shoot his weak point
[1:56:19] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> if only
[1:56:37] <@PeachSaliva> @demonstrandum Aw shucks thanks! Can’t blame ya
[1:56:38] <Jazz_Cannon> Z-Target his teeny arms!
[1:56:49] <@PeachSaliva> Eli why do you want me not to watch you
[1:56:52] <@PeachSaliva> :(
[1:56:53] <+OwlLightningMage> I didn't know he could do that
[1:56:53] <Sloavon> Shadow Plague
[1:56:59] <AFlyingTaco1> Punished Plague
[1:57:03] <Paralurx> Paige this is actually LIquid Plague
[1:57:09] <mellorolo> Si, pero ¿Puedes decirme por qué a los niños les encanta el sabor del Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[1:57:09] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Those are its testicles you're shooting
[1:57:17] <+OwlLightningMage> This fight still isn't worse than Exploiter
[1:57:18] <+LittleBigQuebec> she's mad because being in the warp made her barren
[1:57:19] <sinbad2058> dont be mean to mom
[1:57:21] <Puhff> is that Wukong?
[1:57:22] <ZComiX> if this frame breaks the encounter why is it allowed?
[1:57:36] <DisGuyOvahEre> you've heard of big zam now get ready for little zam
[1:57:39] <Sloavon> because it has to be
[1:57:40] <Huntercd> So Lotus just wants to get knocked up?
[1:57:42] <+OwlLightningMage> She's mad because her poorly defined motivations
[1:58:19] <theloganbrand> dumbass moth
[1:58:19] <+FadingEmber> this boss is super buggy
[1:58:33] <$Valdorick> This boss debuffs you when you're kiddo. He hates it.
[1:58:42] <cerazor01> *All they fear is you* plays
[1:59:05] <Zombrocom> There is a poorly explained mechanic where natah nullifies your operator mode in this fight, makes it feel like it is bugging out
[1:59:06] <+LittleBigQuebec> SYndicate
[1:59:11] <+FadingEmber> Sydicate weapon
[1:59:12] <CynosZilla> a Syndicate proc?
[1:59:14] <+tussletoes> I like this fight but are the animations still all bugged the fuck out when playing with other players?
[1:59:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Boltor is mediocre
[1:59:26] <+LittleBigQuebec> I'm working to get the vaykor hek
[1:59:37] <YakumoYomi> Roppaloppa?
[1:59:39] <+tussletoes> That is a huge mistake.
[1:59:41] <Andele1503> No no, its ropealoli, just as its gauss not goss
[1:59:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Ropadopa
[1:59:52] <ScreamLord> There are so many fucking things named Blank-Lyst
[2:00:13] <Zombrocom> He has his shield
[2:00:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ropopalypse. And I use it exclusively because nailing people to walls is fun. However, the Acrid is super fucked
[2:00:58] <+tussletoes> So wait, Lotus is a farmer girl? Hm...
[2:01:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Chicken with a guy LUL
[2:01:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It reminds me of the timesplitters turkey men
[2:01:10] <+Demonstrandum> @fruit_pie_the_magician If you like its impaling mechanic, you might enjoy the Stahlta.
[2:01:33] <+FadingEmber> When is Plague farming Grendel? Kappa
[2:01:39] <Zombrocom> Stahlta is pretty much just boltor 2.0
[2:01:43] <+tussletoes> I wish we had more to do in open worlds than the bounties. The bounties are rough
[2:01:45] <+OwlLightningMage> Grendel farming is hell
[2:01:47] <DisGuyOvahEre> ropapopamon
[2:01:51] <+Solutha> which boss fight isnt
[2:02:15] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you are a chew toy now, congrats
[2:02:15] <+tussletoes> I saw the Grendel farm drain the life out of Brozime's body, in real time
[2:02:18] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes The Sentients should really be called Sapients when you think about it. Everyone get's the terms confused
[2:02:21] <Sloavon> new content released for ffxiv plague Kappa
[2:02:23] <+cvp5127> the clone likes to watch
[2:02:27] <+realm_forge> The art style for the sentents I’d cool as fuck
[2:02:33] <+Demonstrandum> Grendel farm ? You mean buying him for plat ?
[2:02:40] <+Demonstrandum> Yeah, rough one
[2:02:45] <Zombrocom> He was under the platform LUL
[2:02:50] <+OwlLightningMage> I totally just bought Grendel for plat
[2:02:59] <+tussletoes> I really like the designs of the weird new Warhammer race of people in Deimos. Whatever they're called
[2:03:04] <DoostCola> dont kink same eli
[2:03:16] <Zombrocom> He really likes to hug you
[2:03:44] <Andele1503> If you want plague, i got all 3
[2:03:53] <+tussletoes> Do you have the sanity for Grendel's farm?
[2:03:56] <+Demonstrandum> I have all locators, but boy those missions..
[2:04:02] <CynosZilla> I don't know what locator i have.
[2:04:10] <+FadingEmber> I have them all but it would make me terribly sad
[2:04:12] <Sloavon> nice poem lotus :)
[2:04:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Those missions are literally the worst though
[2:04:21] <Treuan> So nice they farm them twice
[2:04:23] <Goergorion> isn't it faster to farm the Plat?
[2:04:32] <+OwlLightningMage> it's easier
[2:04:32] <+tussletoes> I've watched other's suffering. I refuse to farm Grendel even once. I'd rather farm for a Prime, sell it and just buy his ass with plat.
[2:04:54] <KaliasTV> The sigil rep system can eat a dick
[2:05:06] <+tussletoes> Everybody *loves* rep caps
[2:05:21] <Andele1503> OR nag pablo for 3 months
[2:05:41] <+OwlLightningMage> DEs biggest problem is that they don't play the game
[2:05:56] <+tussletoes> Poor Pablo.
[2:05:57] <+Demonstrandum> DE needs some dedicated "Game Players" at the company
[2:05:57] <+Solutha> need to build more steves
[2:06:03] <+OwlLightningMage> Poor Pablo LUL
[2:06:21] <Andele1503> Nagging pablo is how titania got her first 2 rounds of fixes and buffs
[2:06:23] <LunarRemix> Doesn't Rebecca play the game too?
[2:06:24] <boredlands> BOLTOR
[2:06:29] <Sloavon> :) what a good dev team
[2:06:31] <+tussletoes> He still botched that Atlas augment I was hyped for, but, I respect Pablo.
[2:07:14] <+tussletoes> All the dredge washes up on Reb's end...
[2:07:16] <SleepyMaribo> wth, how the hell are you doingthat?
[2:07:17] <CynosZilla> do you... do you lose the locator when you get the Grendel part?
[2:07:32] <Huntercd> She wants her eggs back
[2:07:34] <Vexed_Algides> wukong has always been braindead tbh
[2:07:43] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> kinda like playing wisp
[2:07:53] <cerazor01> Merging with their creator?
[2:07:55] <KaliasTV> Movement is my favourite part of the game, then wukong deletes it to install a noclip flight
[2:07:55] <cerazor01> wat
[2:07:58] <+UberWolfman> Oh boy rando voices
[2:08:06] <Vexed_Algides> I find that the only frame I don't go braindead playing is Protea
[2:08:12] <+Demonstrandum> A person that uses voicechat in Warframe ? What in tarnation
[2:08:15] <Zombrocom> Hey, Atlas is great
[2:08:21] <cowardlord> I love that rhino's colors
[2:08:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Oberon's passive is such a fuck you these days.
[2:08:21] <+tussletoes> I will defend Atlas my whole life, but sometimes, even I am powerless
[2:08:21] <+BubbaRands> but...atlas punch tho...
[2:08:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Atlas has two good powers. That's it
[2:08:35] <+tussletoes> Atlas big punch... I enjoy the large punching very much...
[2:08:36] <Emperor_Machinus> He makes people rock hard though
[2:08:45] <CynosZilla> Only way I had fun with Atlas, was when I built him for Ore Gaze.
[2:08:51] <laserbeaming> Atlas punches. That's all I need
[2:09:01] <CynosZilla> His 1 is... meh
[2:09:07] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm shocked they're giving out Pretrify on him
[2:09:12] <$Valdorick> Ew, talkers
[2:09:16] <Sloavon> stop talking please :)
[2:09:23] <OldOnyx> Bingo, Reb can only nag somebody to slightly better effect then we and that often doesn't work. Even Pablo has to ask for the ok for a change to actually make it to mainline even if the change is a simple one
[2:09:26] <+tussletoes> I want to debrief everyone on the fucking roadmap to making Atlas good, great even, but no one has time for that, so I give up
[2:09:29] <cerazor01> plague we don't like talkers, please stop
[2:09:35] <OldOnyx> *then we can
[2:09:36] <laserbeaming> yeah, I thought Atlas would give his 2 instead of petrify
[2:09:45] <Andele1503> Issue with atlas is people forget to use his 3 constantly, which is half of his damage
[2:09:53] <+OwlLightningMage> His two is so bad
[2:10:02] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Is he supposed to clip through the grounds like that?
[2:10:10] <+tussletoes> Petrify is decent CC, it baffles me some people try to use his 1 without it but even on its own, landslide can do great dmg
[2:10:19] <+OwlLightningMage> It's almost like Lotus is a bad character
[2:10:20] <Huntercd> Something about not getting pregnant and her regrets
[2:10:23] <Andele1503> other than that he has around 3/4ths of khoras damage and slightly more with augment
[2:10:24] <Zombrocom> She is pretty much just telling the big ropey bird to die for no reason
[2:10:27] <+tussletoes> Specially with the double dmg augment or w/e it's called.
[2:10:28] <KaliasTV> This fight has an operator disabling mechanic, it's bad so it feels like a bug
[2:10:38] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:11:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> f
[2:11:05] <+OwlLightningMage> The only thing good about Lotus is that she has Reb's voice.
[2:11:06] <Sloavon> LUL
[2:11:06] <+Demonstrandum> I'm looking forward to the Garuda altars, love me a good dash and heal
[2:11:07] <laserbeaming> who uses the voice chat?
[2:11:25] <LunarRemix> Why do you even have voice chat on?
[2:11:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Cool Voiceman
[2:11:32] <laserbeaming> I kinda like this boss
[2:11:40] <Zombrocom> Blood altar heals nekros shadows, pretty cool build to do with Deimos
[2:11:42] <$Valdorick> You only need to fight one Ropalyst
[2:11:48] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's shorter, so better
[2:11:59] <+tussletoes> Eidolons are cool to look at, at least the Ropalolyst fight doesn't overstay its welcome (unless you're farming it, which is what this game asks from you 90% of the time)
[2:12:16] <+tussletoes> Ooh boy I've met some talkers.
[2:12:24] <ScreamLord> Arcolf's voice is pure sex energy
[2:12:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Filthy gross extroverts
[2:12:31] <Sloavon> i wanna talk plague :)
[2:12:43] <+UltraViolet371> are there extraverts that play warframe?
[2:12:49] <jasper_rouge> I've run into French players in voice chat and it was fun to just listen to them shooting the shit.
[2:13:00] <+tussletoes> By the time you get to the third Eidolon it looks like a Fortnite concert.
[2:13:08] <broaches> eidolon fights are eye cancer, but duration wise it can be optimized down to really low kill times
[2:13:09] <ECRead> buggy Roly Poly Oly
[2:13:09] <$Valdorick> God, the second Edilon is such a fucking mess of light effects
[2:13:13] <cerazor01> Hugged by Raparopalisto
[2:13:34] <+tussletoes> Or second, yeah. Warframe loves its particles, and it has plenty to spare
[2:13:41] <$Valdorick> The third one is bad too if you get fucked by the EMP waves
[2:13:44] <ScreamLord> no
[2:13:45] <laserbeaming> Any reason for Djinn? Or did you just want to blow the dust off it?
[2:13:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> naah
[2:13:47] <cerazor01> no
[2:13:48] <ZComiX> yes
[2:13:50] <Zombrocom> I am SO GLAD that scarlet spear came along and let me farm every single arcane so I never have to do eidolons again
[2:13:50] <IcanConfuse> nope
[2:13:52] <+tussletoes> Yes.
[2:13:54] <SleepyMaribo> 2
[2:13:54] <ECRead> 2
[2:13:55] <ZComiX> 1
[2:13:55] <+REDtheBEAST> 2

[2:13:57] <Twoiis> 2
[2:13:57] <+tussletoes> 1
[2:13:58] <+UltraViolet371> a bp that un-makes wisp
[2:13:58] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> 2
[2:13:59] <cerazor01> 2
[2:13:59] <Kain5707> 3
[2:13:59] <KaiserMario> 2

[2:14:00] <CynosZilla> 2
[2:14:00] <ScreamLord> 2
[2:14:00] <+OwlLightningMage> I think you have to buy it?
[2:14:02] <Zombrocom> 1
[2:14:02] <laserbeaming> 2
[2:14:02] <squidking96> 2
[2:14:05] <Sloavon> 1 :)
[2:14:08] <+tussletoes> Negative nancies over here
[2:14:11] <+tussletoes> You're probably right though
[2:14:25] <CynosZilla> RNG in this game is evil
[2:14:27] <ECRead> i win :D
[2:14:28] <Kain5707> 3 for maybe OpieOP
[2:14:30] <ZComiX> :D
[2:14:30] <YakumoYomi> Stop making fun of the way I talk, Plague
[2:14:38] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> mmmmmmm yes I win
[2:14:42] <ScreamLord> I'll take my billions of dollars now
[2:14:47] <+tussletoes> If you chose 2 you're a coward, but that's okay because 2 also meant safety.
[2:15:02] <FieldMedic4077> It's because of the people who voted 2 that you got it
[2:15:06] <broaches> syndicate system 2.0 one day LUL
[2:15:13] <laserbeaming> She's too racist towards grineer to like Steel Meridian
[2:15:25] <broaches> just like all the other 2.0s they'll be doing for literally all the systems they've added ever
[2:15:34] <TehMud> Decided to stick through a Defense mission to Wave 20 for the drops. Nature said no and knocked out the block's internet for an hour. Could've been worse but ffffffff
[2:15:42] <$Valdorick> No, tramp stamp your warframe with the brands
[2:15:46] <+tussletoes> I wish I wasn't locked to only half of the syndicates in the game at any given time, and if I want to try the others I have to basically start all over again
[2:15:50] <cowardlord> wouldn't waste a decal slot
[2:15:55] <+OwlLightningMage> Stop being logical Plague
[2:16:30] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> ^
[2:16:34] <LunarRemix> We'll stop sending death squad
[2:16:36] <broaches> just add level locks like monster hunter world guiding lands
[2:16:37] <$Valdorick> "We'll even sell our garbage specters to you"
[2:16:44] <+Solutha> remove a layer of grinding? cant do that
[2:17:17] <+tussletoes> We're bloodthirsty children!!! Send treats our way.
[2:17:17] <masterreviewer1000> So basically it's "Shut up and take my money" but with force?
[2:17:17] <+FadingEmber> LUL you think you can kill me
[2:17:23] <MilkingEdge> Spice things up a little
[2:17:27] <cerazor01> PogChamp
[2:17:28] <laserbeaming> There was that one time in Steel Path a New Loka Death Squad killed me
[2:17:29] <TehMud> Naw final mission should be stealing all their stuff and burning it all to the ground in a glorious rage full of fire and destrution.
[2:17:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Friends murder friends for training. It's like shonen anime
[2:17:43] <ScreamLord> Futaframe
[2:17:48] <+Demonstrandum> Wisp compensates for her lack of legs with a massive schlong
[2:17:57] <laserbeaming> Futaframe is indeed a thing
[2:18:00] <+OwlLightningMage> The world isn't ready for a Frame so power
[2:18:08] <+PowerArmorMeow> yeah the syndicate balancing act is annoying
[2:18:13] <laserbeaming> Hydroid! Vay Hek!
[2:18:18] <+OwlLightningMage> Only an adult operator can use that frame
[2:18:49] <laserbeaming> Do you still need the keys for Mesa?
[2:19:04] <+FadingEmber> Infested Salvage for Nidus
[2:19:04] <laserbeaming> the Alad V Coordinate thing?
[2:19:05] <+Solutha> infested salvage
[2:19:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> farming nidus is a miserable experience
[2:19:17] <+OwlLightningMage> I had fun farming Nidus
[2:19:17] <+KTDelgado> go farm nidus
[2:19:18] <$Valdorick> Its such a fucking bullet sponage
[2:19:19] <+tussletoes> The Vay Hek is a confusing blur. At some point, it just ends.
[2:19:30] <Sunstalker> Shoot his face right in the balls
[2:19:33] <CynosZilla> you shoot the glowy thing. That is it
[2:19:37] <SpookyBeef7> It doesn't work because the weak point is only open for half a nanosecond.
[2:19:40] <+Demonstrandum> There's just a glowing weak spot
[2:19:45] <+Demonstrandum> and you can skip to the end
[2:19:46] <+tussletoes> Some of the bosses have that problem. Where the hell do you even shoot most of them!?
[2:19:46] <$Valdorick> ... Its a contender
[2:19:51] <laserbeaming> Vay Hek is indeed the worst boss
[2:19:52] <+PowerArmorMeow> having to builds Warframe to feed the helminth is not great either...
[2:19:54] <+OwlLightningMage> No
[2:19:54] <CalderGaming> Jordas Golem
[2:19:55] <AFlyingTaco1> But are you still breathing his air?
[2:19:57] <+tussletoes> Leave the sargeant alone.
[2:19:59] <+OwlLightningMage> Exploiter is
[2:20:00] <$Valdorick> Jordas, yeah
[2:20:01] <+Solutha> Sorite vay hek
[2:20:01] <laserbeaming> Jordas is a close second
[2:20:04] <SpookyBeef7> Eh, Scarlet Spear was just grindy.
[2:20:06] <cerazor01> Vor?
[2:20:07] <$Valdorick> Exploiter sucks ass too
[2:20:07] <+tussletoes> Jordas has to be the one.
[2:20:07] <+PowerArmorMeow> agreed the vay held bad
[2:20:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Jordas or Exploiter
[2:20:16] <SpookyBeef7> Jordas is literally noithing.
[2:20:27] <CalderGaming> oh no what have I done
[2:20:37] <Andele1503> Are people confusing exploiter for profit taker here?
[2:20:42] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm so glad I saved my Atlas
[2:20:45] <+tussletoes> DE please just give him an exalted weapon.
[2:20:50] <laserbeaming> For Jordas, it's better to bring Odanata, strangely enough. The fire damage from its 1 helps make the fight faster
[2:20:51] <+deviljhojho_> ah, the rare plaguestream
[2:20:53] <+UltraViolet371> How many frames have you potato'ed
[2:20:54] <+OwlLightningMage> Exploiter takes too long.
[2:20:55] <cerazor01> ResidentSleeper
[2:20:56] <$Valdorick> They should rework Atlas and give him his FISTS as a summon weapon
[2:21:04] <cap_bon> Make sure you have the right tramp stamp before the missions tarts LUL
[2:21:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Profit Taker can at least be done fast
[2:21:18] <laserbeaming> what archgun do you have?
[2:21:19] <$Valdorick> Profit Taker is at least fun.
[2:21:22] <+tussletoes> It's kinda neat until you get to the boss.
[2:21:25] <Sunstalker> Atlas needs big ghost fists that punch shit for him
[2:21:26] <+PowerArmorMeow> i remember vay hek being easier with tonkor
[2:21:29] <+deviljhojho_> molases on ice
[2:21:29] <laserbeaming> PHERLIAC PODS
[2:21:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Profit Taker is also more fun
[2:21:45] <+tussletoes> Atlas Prime has normal walking speed, btw
[2:21:53] <ScreamLord> I remember when Excalibur had Super Jump instead of Exalted Blade
[2:21:53] <Andele1503> @OwlLightningMage its a fixed amount of ammo and you can massively speed it up by shooting the cans just as they would hit, profit taker meanwhile is filled with "use rhino/nezha or get bounced around" while having same amount of mechanics
[2:21:55] <+tussletoes> Must be that caboose he's packing that's slowing him down.
[2:22:03] <laserbeaming> He's a Cephalon that got infected by the infestation
[2:22:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> assisted suicide
[2:22:17] <Andele1503> tho both are "ok" imo, especially compared to vhek
[2:22:22] <+KTDelgado> he wants to stop himself from pulling in more ships
[2:22:29] <$Valdorick> Oh, yeah, I always confuse Exploiter and profit taker
[2:22:40] <$Valdorick> Fuck the first one, the frozen one is okay.
[2:22:41] <+PowerArmorMeow> the muralist strain of the infection
[2:22:58] <+PowerArmorMeow> *mutalist
[2:23:41] <Sunstalker> Plauge nejoys being a dung beetle. vadeAww
[2:23:51] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes Shoot the booster
[2:23:52] <cap_bon> The infestation sounds like Umbrela Corp levels of backfire
[2:23:58] <Sunstalker> Shoot his ass. Like all warframe stuff
[2:23:59] <+tussletoes> Hope your arch gun is good.
[2:24:06] <+PowerArmorMeow> duh b hole
[2:24:06] <+OwlLightningMage> I super don't remember this LUL
[2:24:21] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm so glad I saved my regular Atlas
[2:24:25] <laserbeaming> there's more archgun mods now
[2:24:31] <+Solutha> still dislike the new archwing flight
[2:25:01] <+tussletoes> Are they done with the "Archwing rework"? I'm still hoping the movement gets an overhaul.
[2:25:02] <cap_bon> Hey we made a weapon that infests everything and makes it go crazy. Wont that infest us to? ah who cares
[2:25:05] <+FadingEmber> Nevermind you were already doing it
[2:25:17] <+tussletoes> Since you know, they had to audacity to cite Zone of the Enders as inspiration for a rework
[2:25:19] <ECRead> Pultra-lookin-ass boss
[2:25:41] <+PowerArmorMeow> @cap_bon different strain of infection
[2:25:42] <+OwlLightningMage> The Sacrifice explains why we don't get infected
[2:25:48] <laserbeaming> This fight used to take forever, before good Archgun mods
[2:25:52] <LunarRemix> I mainly use the Larkspur on normal regular missions after a few rivens
[2:26:11] <Andele1503> Nah, its because of the armor squish, jordas lost like 70% of his EHP
[2:26:22] <KaiserMario> Only 2? You sure about that?
[2:26:25] <+tussletoes> That's optimistic.
[2:26:30] <+OwlLightningMage> You mean like 8
[2:26:41] <cap_bon> whats that bottom arch wing gun
[2:26:48] <$Valdorick> XxXMyChemicalStalkerXxX has messaged you "While you were killing bosses, I studied the blade, kiddo."
[2:26:52] <+tussletoes> Vandal is the "meta" archgun, whatever that means. Supposedly.
[2:26:55] <+OwlLightningMage> What actually IS Stalker?
[2:27:07] <+tussletoes> Far as I'm concerned it's good enough
[2:27:34] <+FadingEmber> Stalker is a sentient
[2:27:40] <$Valdorick> What is Stalker? An edge lord.
[2:27:49] <Andele1503> @OwlLightningMage Probably a operator that was loyal to orokin and forgot about being a operator, much like primal/rabid rhino from rhino prime lore
[2:27:50] <+tussletoes> Oh haha the menu still bugs out like that
[2:27:57] <$Valdorick> Oh my god, he has a personal letter LUL
[2:28:09] <+OwlLightningMage> I guess that makes sense
[2:28:11] <laserbeaming> Stalker and Jordas were drinking buddies
[2:28:13] <+tussletoes> Amass the hate mail for maximum gains.
[2:28:45] <laserbeaming> Stalker is a Tenno that kind of forgot he's a Space Kid
[2:28:46] <broaches> stalker is a reminder we'll never get dark souls invasions in warframe
[2:28:47] <+tussletoes> The game hates that
[2:28:53] <Andele1503> Nah, we got no lore about who the other 8 subjects are that ballas transformed into umbra frames
[2:28:56] <cap_bon> Its a good thing you dont get archwing rivens from normal sorties that shit would be awful
[2:29:00] <+OwlLightningMage> Maybe Stalker is Umbras kid we see in Sacrifice
[2:29:04] <Andele1503> (since Umbra is subject 9)
[2:29:07] <OldOnyx> Think he's a Tenno that got stuck in his frame but I don't know it thats still cannon
[2:29:08] <+OwlLightningMage> idk
[2:29:17] <ScreamLord> Remember when Stalker was cool?
[2:29:33] <Andele1503> Stalker is still cool, Shadow stalker tho is a prissy bitch
[2:29:33] <$Valdorick> Remember when stalker was a threat to you?
[2:29:35] <+FadingEmber> hmmm might need to restart WF
[2:29:40] <$Valdorick> and then he upgraded, and became WEAKER!?
[2:29:42] <Zooperton> why he get so mad when you kill anyone?
[2:29:55] <+PowerArmorMeow> stalker is a former dax soldier
[2:29:57] <+tussletoes> There's like a billion codex entries, I don't remember much though. He was a Tenno I think
[2:29:59] <$Valdorick> Remember when he could do crit bleeds on you with 360 no scope bow shots?
[2:30:02] <+tussletoes> Ah nevermind
[2:30:03] <+Demonstrandum> Wasn't Stalker a tenno that didn't get stasised after the void incident ?
[2:30:09] <+OwlLightningMage> He's less of a threat than a high level lich
[2:30:11] <Andele1503> Regular form is still a threat, he is even a bigger threat since melee rework since his scythe now guarantees slash procs
[2:30:12] <+BubbaRands> Stalker is the Bass to your Megaman. Your SHadow to your Sanik
[2:30:14] <Sunstalker> the only danger Stalker poses is if he spawns in a weird spot and then telports you to him froma cross the map because he was too slow to spawn in
[2:30:15] <LunarRemix> Aren't they planning on doing something like a PvP mode where players get to control a Stalker or something like that?
[2:30:15] <cap_bon> He was a threat for a small time when people didnt understand how his absorb skill worked LUL
[2:30:24] <LunarRemix> I remember something like that in a Dev stream or something
[2:30:26] <Andele1503> its his sentient bitch mode thats weak
[2:30:32] <laserbeaming> I liked that brief bug that made Stalker's Feet appear instead of his face in the portrait when he's all "YOUR JUDGEMENT IS DEATH"
[2:30:33] <$Valdorick> And yeah, they want to add a Stalker mode
[2:30:44] <+tussletoes> Stalker mode will never come out. Mark my words
[2:30:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:31:09] <OldOnyx> They're too chicken to pull the trigger on stalker mode
[2:31:11] <+OwlLightningMage> Fire Blast is terrible though
[2:31:29] <+tussletoes> You were talking about weird weak spots?
[2:31:30] <$Valdorick> I liked the bug where Stalker could spawn in Archwing missions and was HUGE
[2:31:32] <+tussletoes> Enjoy!
[2:31:33] <Emperor_Machinus> Shoot the back
[2:31:34] <+OwlLightningMage> shout the glowy part
[2:31:37] <Andele1503> they slowly open up based on his AI RNG
[2:31:49] <+tussletoes> I think one's his arm, another is his back?
[2:31:50] <laserbeaming> Shoulder, back, chest
[2:32:01] <cap_bon> people keep nuking our bosses so lets make him invulnerable for 99% of the time LUL
[2:32:03] <OldOnyx> It makes perfect sense with steel path being a thing but their too afraid of the bitching that would come with stalker mode
[2:32:11] <+BubbaRands> Remember when Bosses just head health bars and not hard to find gimmicks? Kappa
[2:32:12] <OldOnyx> *they're
[2:32:24] <+FadingEmber> Just keep shooting til he is dead
[2:32:44] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[2:33:04] <+Demonstrandum> From what I understand, you shoot the blue / white glow whenever you see it. It appears whenever he does a move
[2:33:05] <laserbeaming> use your 3 on the barricade
[2:33:22] <+tussletoes> You just wait for someone who knows how to do it to do it for you!
[2:33:25] <+OwlLightningMage> You scream into his open butthole and he will fall down in shame
[2:33:33] <laserbeaming> It's pointless!
[2:33:35] <laserbeaming> I love it
[2:33:39] <+tussletoes> It goes from like 5 to 6 damage or something.
[2:33:47] <+tussletoes> It's cute, though. I like the shiny bulwarks.
[2:33:55] <cap_bon> frost :)
[2:34:00] <Emperor_Machinus> summon rock goblins
[2:34:05] <TehMud> Well at least you didn't blow all your Void Traces on one drop that the game still refuses to give you.
[2:34:09] <No3rdImpactPlz> "Look mommy! I made a pillow fort with my rocks!"
[2:34:44] <+tussletoes> Warframe: Stolen Valor
[2:34:45] <cap_bon> becuase you were very close to having fun in an archwing and the game cant allow that.
[2:34:58] <$Valdorick> That's big thinking
[2:35:08] <+OwlLightningMage> Those mechs are gonna be terrible
[2:35:12] <+tussletoes> Having the biggest number is my one joy as Atlas...
[2:35:34] <TehMud> I do still like Warframe overall but yeah it definitely has plenty of issues
[2:35:40] <+Demonstrandum> That glow is what you want to hit
[2:35:58] <+OwlLightningMage> I love Warframe. That's also why I love complaining about it
[2:36:09] <TehMud> Same
[2:36:10] <+PowerArmorMeow> shoulders and back
[2:36:22] <No3rdImpactPlz> Getting pushed under geometry increases the drop rate of the thing you want by 250%
[2:36:27] <$Valdorick> True love is complaining so it might be better.
[2:36:42] <laserbeaming> Stairs, the natural enemy of the Tenno, second only to those little boxes that raise from the floor in Orokin Towers
[2:36:48] <+BubbaRands> for now...
[2:36:56] <+OwlLightningMage> We got fire Blast
[2:37:43] <AFlyingTaco1> Why he hef to be mad
[2:37:48] <TehMud> Yet Stalker still won't drop WAR for me
[2:37:50] <$Valdorick> I love his fucking letter heading
[2:37:56] <laserbeaming> he might have used GIMP!
[2:37:58] <+tussletoes> He worked so hard on his forum banner. Leave him alone
[2:38:03] <$Valdorick> XxXNothingPersonalKiddoXxX
[2:38:05] <cap_bon> you must be punished for killing that *checks notes* mass murdering monster
[2:38:10] <+OwlLightningMage> You're killing all Stalkers DnD party
[2:38:26] <+OwlLightningMage> That Golem was his cleric.
[2:38:28] <+UltraViolet371> cap_bon LUL
[2:38:29] <+PowerArmorMeow> edgecalibur
[2:38:38] <$Valdorick> That's a good tits
[2:38:39] <laserbeaming> I behold!
[2:38:40] <+OwlLightningMage> Pretty
[2:38:42] <laserbeaming> she's pretty
[2:38:43] <TehMud> Okay that is nice
[2:39:10] <chidory000> hey Plague do you have the warframe that makes the music?
[2:39:24] <cerazor01> makes dah musik
[2:39:28] <laserbeaming> I kinda wish Warframe had better skyboxes
[2:39:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Octavia. The more boring Warframe in existence
[2:39:36] <cap_bon> warframes got alot of good designs but its ships are kinda eh
[2:40:02] <KaiserMario> "Phalic pods?"
[2:40:08] <laserbeaming> PhErLiaC PoDs
[2:40:17] <+tussletoes> I like the landing craft designs. Weird animal ships.
[2:40:23] <TehMud> The new Nightwave ship looks nice but grinding up to 30 eeeehhhhh
[2:40:34] <No3rdImpactPlz> It's like you're playing as Puck, but with a gun
[2:40:46] <DisGuyOvahEre> is it worth farming egg for dog or should i get one of the flying R2D2s
[2:40:47] <+PowerArmorMeow> @tehmud I get what ya mean
[2:40:48] <+tussletoes> Ah, you must mean Pakku.
[2:40:50] <$Valdorick> Tiny noise with much death coming from it
[2:40:55] <+tussletoes> Gattsu's companion
[2:41:04] <JohnClaggart> he means aotans
[2:41:06] <No3rdImpactPlz> GATS
[2:41:10] <$Valdorick> attack his weak point for massive damage
[2:41:11] <+tussletoes> Nuttz
[2:41:25] <cap_bon> I wish I could just give titania energy vampire so I can be tiny all the time
[2:41:43] <TehMud> I had to be carried to actually grind Atlas the first time
[2:41:53] <+OwlLightningMage> You can give her the energy dispensary
[2:41:56] <+PowerArmorMeow> I'm at tier 20
[2:42:00] <$Valdorick> DAMAGE
[2:42:01] <cap_bon> Im not willing to put the effort into archwing becuase it sucks ass
[2:42:04] <JohnClaggart> melted
[2:42:11] <KaiserMario> Hi hi hi hi
[2:42:13] <+tussletoes> I had to carry many people through this fight in order to brainwash them into playing Atlas
[2:42:16] <No3rdImpactPlz> "Now that's a lot of DAMAGE!"
[2:42:27] <+tussletoes> Kinda sad, it's pretty easy now.
[2:42:33] <LunarRemix> There's no squad queue either
[2:42:33] <$Valdorick> He must now go through ALL RP
[2:42:38] <$Valdorick> Oh good
[2:42:42] <alextrebeken> Tf? thing takes me like 5 mins normally
[2:42:42] <laserbeaming> I don't think you are meant to kill him this fast
[2:42:48] <KaiserMario> Lucky bastard
[2:42:50] <TehMud> Welp my arch-gun is definitely a piece of crap
[2:42:51] <cap_bon> Does archwing still have super fucked up units of measurements?
[2:42:52] <cerazor01> cmonBruh
[2:42:54] <+tussletoes> That's what Vandal do
[2:43:04] <Dragonfighter46> i remembered when i did this with the initial gun without mods because i didn't know where to get mods and it took me like an hour
[2:43:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I need to build the corvas
[2:43:11] <$Valdorick> That a riven'd Imp?
[2:43:17] <+tussletoes> Seriously though, back then it was easily 5-10 minutes for most people.
[2:43:27] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[2:43:28] <+PowerArmorMeow> dig this new screen
[2:43:42] <KaiserMario> Do you never play solo?
[2:43:56] <+tussletoes> Playing solo might trick the confused matchmaking into working.
[2:43:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Atlas needs work
[2:43:59] <+UltraViolet371> Did the recent update cut Simaris' costs yet or is that going to happen with Deimos itself?
[2:44:02] <+FadingEmber> try solo maybe?
[2:44:05] <+PowerArmorMeow> I would help @plagueofgripes but I'm on console.
[2:44:06] <cap_bon> you had to much fun in archwing so the mission is on cooldown LUL
[2:44:21] <Zombrocom> Atlas was the first warframe I tried to farm. All I had was mag and basic gear. Standard imperator, no mods. It was a NIGHTMARE.
[2:44:23] <+tussletoes> Time for the live dissection
[2:44:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Simaris got his costs cut already
[2:44:37] <TehMud> YES
[2:44:37] <+OwlLightningMage> It went through early
[2:44:39] <+siffles> So how do you feel about HoD stuff they've shown? Anything particularly you like or dislike
[2:44:39] <Srthunda> ya
[2:44:49] <+OwlLightningMage> YOOOOO PLAGUE PogChamp
[2:44:57] <+OwlLightningMage> THAT WOULD BE SICK
[2:44:57] <+tussletoes> It's so sad that they got rid of his weird lanky abs in his Prime.
[2:45:04] <+OwlLightningMage> YOU GENIUS
[2:45:09] <+PowerArmorMeow> they made atlas into 1 lunch man
[2:45:09] <KaiserMario> Pai Mei?
[2:45:10] <+tussletoes> Atlas, to me, will always be swole tiny head man
[2:45:18] <+tussletoes> Shikoro helmet is the best
[2:45:19] <+BubbaRands> Fucking sick! PogChamp
[2:45:19] <+OwlLightningMage> THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA
[2:45:25] <cap_bon> Muscle Wizard atlas
[2:45:27] <Zombrocom> Cant wait for Deimos to drop atlas's stupid wall for Larva
[2:45:35] <+kahryez> So he'd have Rhino's 4? except as a punch?
[2:45:40] <AFlyingTaco1> Man I had so much trouble with this asshole the first time through
[2:45:42] <+valiard> is it bad that I just want to play Tyl regor
[2:45:42] <Zombrocom> Zoop em up in a ball and punch the fuck outta them
[2:46:04] <+StrangeCoincidence> dame da ne
[2:46:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Unironically hire Plague to fix Warframe LUL
[2:46:16] <+tussletoes> Hammer time, etc etc
[2:46:18] <Huntercd> Why have cape? It covers up the ass
[2:46:23] <$Valdorick> I love Tyl Regor
[2:46:26] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm so ready for Atlas to be Whiteboard
[2:46:27] <$Valdorick> I want them to use him more.
[2:46:33] <+tussletoes> I feel so bad for those poor Tubemen.
[2:46:37] <+OwlLightningMage> Whitebeard
[2:46:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> lol when he goes behind that door up there, you can use hallowed ground and then reckoning him while hes on the other side
[2:46:39] <Zombrocom> THE TOOOOOBMEN
[2:46:40] <$Valdorick> Instead we've gotten 2 years of hearing copus assholes
[2:46:41] <laserbeaming> I love his little Naruto Run
[2:46:57] <+PowerArmorMeow> *punch
[2:47:15] <+tussletoes> I want Tyl Regor to come back with an eyepatch over his mask, and a beard
[2:47:21] <+FroggoPrince> General Kenobi
[2:47:31] <+OwlLightningMage> He should become a kuva lich or something
[2:47:46] <$Valdorick> Tyl "Punished Toobman" Regor
[2:47:55] <+tussletoes> For reasons?
[2:47:58] <+BubbaRands> for reasons
[2:48:01] <+FadingEmber> for reasons
[2:48:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Obvious reasons
[2:48:09] <+UltraViolet371> oh yay you levelled perrin sequence
[2:48:11] <ScreamLord> for good reasons
[2:48:30] <+OwlLightningMage> Workshop Atlas Whitebeard
[2:48:38] <+tussletoes> Tyl Regor is just a good time, I think sometimes I'd just play the mission and let him ramble
[2:48:50] <+tussletoes> So I have a backlog of Equinox parts
[2:48:54] <Zombrocom> Equiniox makes me wish we could feed primes to helminith, equinox prime is so much easier to get
[2:48:58] <laserbeaming> "gimme forma" -- Red Veil guy
[2:49:13] <Huntercd> I hate the perrin sequence bunch fart smelling rich assholes
[2:49:16] <Zombrocom> Jesus 10k plat my god
[2:49:23] <CynosZilla> feed them kavats
[2:49:23] <+tussletoes> He has use for your suffering
[2:49:25] <cap_bon> His junk
[2:49:25] <Treuan> Gotta forma their dark dagger
[2:49:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always want to say "Regor you moron a live dissection is a vivisection"
[2:49:26] <$Valdorick> "We were going to forma our DICKS"
[2:49:27] <+OwlLightningMage> They eat it
[2:49:29] <JohnClaggart> they use it as a doorstop
[2:49:36] <cap_bon> Imagine putting forma on your dick
[2:49:38] <DoostCola> BLOOD
[2:49:51] <+tussletoes> Gotta grind for that dick
[2:49:59] <laserbeaming> if you type Red Veil you'll get all their sigils
[2:50:14] <KaiserMario> Yee-haw
[2:50:16] <CynosZilla> can't you just search them by key word?
[2:50:24] <Huntercd> fire and blood
[2:50:33] <CynosZilla> the regalia, I mean.
[2:50:33] <+PowerArmorMeow> just search red veil and all the red veil symbols show
[2:50:37] <cap_bon> Im still on that Graxx skin train
[2:50:43] <Zombrocom> Mesa Prime is so good looking
[2:50:50] <Huntercd> flesh armor
[2:50:58] <lemoan> dem thighs
[2:51:11] <Puhff> Have you spent any RL money on Warframe?
[2:51:11] <TheAsylumCat> warframes are meat robots
[2:51:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Trinity is queen thighs
[2:51:18] <CynosZilla> No it still suck, I agree, but at least no need to suffer more than it is needed.
[2:51:31] <KaiserMario> What do you think of Valkyr?
[2:51:34] <cap_bon> Is Zepthry still garbo
[2:51:35] <+tussletoes> Game must be freaking the fuck out seeing people beat Jordas in seconds. Just doesn't know how to process it.
[2:51:39] <Fodderbot> thankfullly I kept the hard to farm frames as I got the primes
[2:51:47] <laserbeaming> I could use a Snickers Bar right now
[2:51:50] <Fodderbot> so all I have left is the stuff I have to buy from simaris
[2:52:02] <OldOnyx> God I don't think Jordas has been touched since people still played Frost
[2:52:10] <Vexed_Algides> p r o t e c
[2:52:26] <+OwlLightningMage> It's weird that we don't have a samurai Warframe in a space ninja game
[2:52:27] <AFlyingTaco1> Oh god it's t he crab all over again
[2:52:36] <+tussletoes> Oh I got an entire Bible written about how to play Frost too, don't tempt me
[2:52:48] <Huntercd> Excal is the samurai
[2:52:54] <+OwlLightningMage> eh
[2:52:55] <lemoan> stop bullying them
[2:53:03] <+OwlLightningMage> He's more a knight
[2:53:11] <Huntercd> Same thing
[2:53:13] <+tussletoes> Meatheads like us gotta learn from Gauss, weaponizing our constant running into walls
[2:53:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Eh
[2:53:20] <+OwlLightningMage> I guess
[2:53:45] <+UltraViolet371> I like how the corpse pops into the air like an elder scrolls ragdoll
[2:53:46] <silverlieutenant> nicobBang
[2:54:01] <CynosZilla> Gaus is cool, and good
[2:54:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Guass is fun
[2:54:32] <KaiserMario> Plague, do you play Valkyr?
[2:54:47] <cap_bon> Time to die tennoo...oh god, oooooh my health, god what did you do
[2:54:52] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I think DE uses words without thinking what they mean too. Because during Plague Star events Lotus will talk about the tumor going into "Peristalsis" but when you learn what that word means she's basically saying it's taking a big shit
[2:55:06] <+tussletoes> Arch guns are genuinely pretty fun, don't care about you meta freaks. Too bad they're such a nightmare to rank up
[2:55:08] <KaiserMario> LUL
[2:55:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Valkyr needs help
[2:55:27] <$Valdorick> Lets be honest though, the plague star looks like an anus, they likely knew what word to use.
[2:55:43] <Huntercd> Mag's faster cousin
[2:55:44] <+OwlLightningMage> And since you can give Eternal War to other frames there's even less reason to use her
[2:55:53] <+tussletoes> Tennogen is being made for him I think, his model was released recently
[2:56:05] <cap_bon> Nova has some sick skins
[2:56:15] <CynosZilla> He is a bit too "mechanical" for my taste, but I like how he looks.
[2:56:16] <+OwlLightningMage> It worked PogChamp
[2:56:30] <+tussletoes> I like the Nova Deluxe's cool arm animations
[2:56:37] <+OwlLightningMage> You push 4 and then you push one.
[2:56:50] <Zombrocom> The Eris tileset is the worst
[2:57:01] <CynosZilla> Open space? On a old tileset? What is that?
[2:57:15] <Huntercd> I wish there were voice options for Ordis I am tired of his simp attitude
[2:57:16] <+tussletoes> Old tilesets could be in a survival horror game.
[2:57:24] <+tussletoes> So Gauss' worst nightmare
[2:57:43] <Zombrocom> Brt
[2:57:51] <cap_bon> I miss tiny archwing already
[2:58:11] <+tussletoes> Imagine using the Soma. Pathetic
[2:58:14] <JohnClaggart> squeaky chair
[2:58:18] <+D00msDayDan> i still miss the gorgon's original sound
[2:58:30] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It sounds like when you make rapid fire gun noises with your mouth.
[2:58:40] <Huntercd> Grineer weapons are fun war crimes
[2:58:46] <cap_bon> I'll always have a soft spot for Gratakas
[2:58:47] <+OwlLightningMage> Weapon feel is important. I use to like Phantasm before they fucked up the effects on it
[2:58:50] <LordTailor> Wow you did that so quick wtf
[2:58:52] <+tussletoes> Zarr is still the best gimmick weapon
[2:59:08] <KaiserMario> No head for u
[2:59:21] <LordTailor> I haven’t played warframe for a couple years
[2:59:42] <Srthunda> I remember that
[2:59:46] <cap_bon> "capture" them as they scream in agony
[2:59:57] <+tussletoes> Fucking obliterated
[3:00:00] <+Demonstrandum> Being digitised can't be fun
[3:00:19] <Treuan> Do you think me a sadist?
[3:00:25] <CynosZilla> This regalia system really is terrible.
[3:00:33] <silverlieutenant> teleport thoring people int pieces? :Library of Ruina flashback intensifies: nicobFear
[3:00:39] <CynosZilla> I just forgot because I stoped caring about it
[3:00:43] <+OwlLightningMage> Workshop Atlas as Whitebeard
[3:00:49] <Huntercd> Did Lotus 'interrogate' them?
[3:01:02] <laserbeaming> I love Gauss
[3:01:05] <+OwlLightningMage> Lotus probably eats them
[3:01:12] <+tussletoes> I think half of my playtime is me scrolling over two different color pallettes
[3:01:20] <ScreamLord> Kinda curious what Gauss Prime would look like
[3:01:22] <Huntercd> Good for her
[3:02:12] <kesler031> man, i took some shady med yesterday, and now my throat feels pretty weird and dry
[3:02:36] <Andele1503> >doesnt do much damage, is 3/4ths of a khora You might want to reword that to "dealing the big damage with it is quite inconvenient"
[3:02:46] <cap_bon> someone got a space std
[3:02:56] <+BubbaRands> "Oh my god, shut up" - Warframe community to Ordis
[3:03:23] <Vexed_Algides> You could even ignore his petrify, just keep pressing 1
[3:03:32] <+OwlLightningMage> Interrupting Cephalons
[3:03:40] <Zombrocom> Give him a nice belly rub... with bullets
[3:03:55] <cap_bon> Grataka ammo pool go brrrrr
[3:03:57] <Paynelesor> Hey plague it’s been a while
[3:04:03] <+tussletoes> His Prime is decently tanky with adaptation thankfully, but OG Atlas really was "mash 1 or you die"
[3:04:10] <+tussletoes> Now it's just "Mash 1, and also press 3"
[3:04:13] <Zombrocom> As someone who plays atlas a lot, I never use his wall. Adaptation + Grace should cover you for all content
[3:04:32] <Vexed_Algides> Just adaptation is fine even
[3:04:33] <+PowerArmorMeow> well they changed atlas so he builds up armor now
[3:04:46] <+tussletoes> His wall I think I only use for Index or Mobile Defense.
[3:05:02] <+tussletoes> Which does work, but it's basically nothing
[3:05:04] <Zombrocom> His wall is for pushing people out of extraction
[3:05:20] <Zombrocom> His wall is garbage, just toss it out completely
[3:05:30] <Andele1503> Or make his augment default
[3:05:33] <ScreamLord> Do as the Cube demands
[3:05:42] <Vexed_Algides> or make it good, like a bigger wall to actually funnel enemies
[3:05:48] <+tussletoes> I just wish they gave his 2 decent damage. I know I still wouldn't kill things in enough time, but it's fun
[3:05:57] <Zombrocom> Tyl is on Uranus
[3:05:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> his wall is good for corridor camping though
[3:06:14] <KaiserMario> Wans't it in "Your Anus?"
[3:07:43] <Andele1503> His actual passive is "free prime sure footed while on ground"
[3:07:55] <+tussletoes> It drains so fucking fast. I wish it was more like Nidus, no idea why it deteriorates at all
[3:08:12] <+OwlLightningMage> LUL
[3:08:20] <KaiserMario> That's a funny image
[3:08:26] <+LittleBigQuebec> is Tyr Regor on break?
[3:08:31] <+tussletoes> But not having to worry about knockdowns is a feeling unlike anything else. A thrill
[3:08:46] <cerazor01> the tubes?
[3:08:48] <+PowerArmorMeow> i guess the idea with the rubble was to promote an active play style
[3:08:50] <KaiserMario> Spaghetti falling from his pockets as he trips and falls onto winning
[3:09:26] <$Valdorick> That's just Equinox though.
[3:09:29] <KaiserMario> They should give him Royalguard
[3:09:43] <$Valdorick> but its more like a hand thing you do when you stompy dance
[3:09:43] <+tussletoes> I wouldn't mind big punches, DE would probably make it drain armor but I'd live with that
[3:09:50] <+OwlLightningMage> The Whitebeard reality shattering punch
[3:10:02] <cap_bon> DE should keep Frost in its current state to make every thankful that their favorite frame isnt as bad as him Kappa
[3:10:03] <+PowerArmorMeow> but barruuk does that.
[3:10:28] <AKidNamedKiller> ash parts
[3:10:28] <+kahryez> ash stuff?
[3:10:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> ash pieces
[3:10:33] <Huntercd> Ash parts I think
[3:10:37] <CynosZilla> Baruk kills rooms
[3:10:37] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:10:45] <+tussletoes> I like Atlas and Baruuk both but they need to get their shit together. I'm sick of making sure my bar doesn't run out.
[3:11:05] <cowardlord> Limbo is the box opener
[3:11:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> i was referring that barruk does room clearing punches
[3:11:16] <Huntercd> Yea
[3:11:25] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes The cape makes Mesa look like a vampire hunter
[3:11:29] <+tussletoes> We're still pretty shady. Isn't Lick trading just trafficking?
[3:11:32] <+OwlLightningMage> It's not one punch though
[3:11:35] <Monkeyweed21> Oh god I have to farm equinox again
[3:11:43] <+tussletoes> *Lich trading. Not... lick trading
[3:11:44] <+PowerArmorMeow> agreed
[3:12:13] <+UltraViolet371> @tussletoes there's definitely a market for the other thing tho
[3:12:13] <+LittleBigQuebec> They really couldn't have put Equinox on a more annoying boss to grind
[3:12:13] <+OwlLightningMage> I'm glad I saved my regular Equinox
[3:12:36] <VroomSoon> Best passive
[3:12:51] <+tussletoes> I play Atlas a lot and you really feel the lack of knockdown immunity when you play anything else, so I can say that at least.
[3:13:05] <kdogg_is_god> make atlas punch into a large slam room clearer when enemies are petrified with massive damage would be cool
[3:13:06] <Andele1503> Now multiply those numbers by 80 because of melee stat stick without any riven
[3:13:21] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:13:32] <+tussletoes> Also, just build for as much elemental as possible, the primed Impact mod isn't really worth it anymore in my experience
[3:13:32] <FenrisWolfhowl> The landslide augment is great if you like that playstyle.
[3:13:42] <ScreamLord> Stalker's super butt hurt you killed that evil dictator/corporate sleazeball/literal mutated monstrosity
[3:13:53] <+tussletoes> Yeah the double damage augment is nuts for Atlas. Just... gotta keep up that rubble, which sucks
[3:13:54] <Andele1503> nah, landslide augment has time to petrify, just use his 3 after every 3rd punch
[3:14:32] <+tussletoes> He's my favorite. My terrible child
[3:14:46] <Andele1503> Plague, let me ask you, do you know what range does on atlas 1?
[3:15:05] <+tussletoes> Range helps, but I wouldn't sacrifice more than one mod slot on it. Just slap stretch
[3:15:26] <+tussletoes> The augment gives you extra range when you reach 1400 and you REALLY feel the difference
[3:15:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> slide further
[3:16:08] <NirvashTypeMQ> how is the pc version with controller? i dont really like playing with kbm if i dont have to
[3:16:08] <+PowerArmorMeow> or like a hemisph
[3:16:24] <Andele1503> Ah plague, here is the thing, Range doesnt influence his DASH range, it influences the range of the AOE on landslide (which is then tripled by combo duration
[3:16:30] <Andele1503> Range is literally his core stat
[3:16:39] <+tussletoes> Rumblers are, to put it as nicely as I can, a distraction
[3:16:46] <+PowerArmorMeow> @nirvashtypemq it's fine you can remap the buttons
[3:16:49] <Monkeyweed21> they did that
[3:16:50] <+tussletoes> The pvp augment came out, and hoo boy
[3:17:10] <Andele1503> Pvp augment forgot to have its values changed from pvp values
[3:17:17] <+UltraViolet371> @NirvashTypeMQ I didn't get much time in before my controller broke entirely, but I remember it being perfectly good
[3:17:20] <Andele1503> nah, it makes your numbers lower
[3:17:23] <+tussletoes> A lot of "this is bigger number, so why would I use smaller number?" I like him a lot but different playstyle for sure.
[3:17:55] <NirvashTypeMQ> hmmm i might try it then, thanks tenchiTogether tenchiForever
[3:18:01] <NirvashTypeMQ> tenchiSad
[3:18:20] <CynosZilla> No "pet" like power really works in this game. We can kill stuff faster then them, and when we can't, the "pets" do nothing.
[3:18:25] <+tussletoes> I think my main problem with Atlas is that you can't build around using all of his kit. You need decent range, decent damage AND decent duration for rumblers (if you even want that)
[3:18:36] <+PowerArmorMeow> maybe using land slide to destroy your own wall
[3:18:59] <+FadingEmber> Just give his fists exalted weapons and make his 1 a dash
[3:19:04] <kdogg_is_god> how about the wall is replaced with picking an enemy up as a shield lol
[3:19:11] <Monkeyweed21> thats why you bind recast to a mouse button
[3:19:15] <jestrfestr> make rumblers run at enemies explode into rubble for armor and a decent aoe
[3:19:18] <+tussletoes> Path of statues + nidus' 2 might do really well. I just use Dethcube for energy recovery and Naramon to build up combo, which makes a huuge difference
[3:19:18] <ScreamLord> Replace Rumblers with an Exalted Weapon
[3:19:21] <jestrfestr> friendly AI sucks
[3:19:34] <+tussletoes> A lot of people I see playing Atlas really underestimate how important combo is for him.
[3:19:41] <+GaspidarIII> make rubble actually stackable armor
[3:20:02] <+GaspidarIII> without decay
[3:20:13] <+tussletoes> Either increase the cap from 1500 to something higher, or stop it from deteriorating, imo.
[3:20:50] <CynosZilla> Over 1500 armor doesn't do much. Diminishing returns
[3:20:58] <+tussletoes> If either his 2 or his 4 get reworked, I hope they help him heal or get DR in some way.
[3:21:05] <CrowsSanctuary> space time! no paiges here.
[3:21:17] <+tussletoes> Rumblers will never kill anything, rework or not, so maybe they could help with healing or DR?
[3:21:22] <Andele1503> @tussletoes his 4 already heal him
[3:21:24] <jestrfestr> augment you can punch your own dumb rumbles to rubble
[3:21:27] <Zombrocom> Drop tectonics completely, it's worthless. Replace with some kinda defensive ability. Rework rumblers to be useful
[3:21:27] <Andele1503> you just double tap em
[3:21:41] <CynosZilla> however, if rubble gave damage reduction, then it would be a beter power.
[3:21:45] <+tussletoes> @Andele1503 Spamming his 4 is the only reason you'd use it right now, and it kinda works, but it uses a lot of energy
[3:22:16] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can use oberon to give the entire team like 7-800 armor permanently PLUS 100 health regen per second
[3:22:19] <Monkeyweed21> what if Rumblers took damage for you ala Shield of Shadows
[3:22:22] <+tussletoes> Old petrify was godawful hahaha
[3:22:25] <Zombrocom> I want rumbler to be a floating rock clone of atlas that follows him and mimics his actions
[3:22:37] <VroomSoon> that would be cool
[3:22:38] <Zombrocom> Might be too similar to wukong though
[3:22:49] <+GaspidarIII> his 4 should syn with rubble and make landslide shotgun burat walls he makes
[3:23:10] <+tussletoes> I fucking *adore* the tiny rumblers when you have really low ability strength
[3:23:30] <jestrfestr> too much dumb Ai for consoles
[3:23:33] <+GaspidarIII> like maggots?????
[3:23:41] <KaiserMario> That'd be very taxing on the ram
[3:23:48] <+tussletoes> Their AI sucks but that's why an AoE would work to fix that I think
[3:24:06] <Zombrocom> Add a hold function that makes all the rumblers you have generated to fly towards you and fuse into a giant boulder that you can hurl forward
[3:24:12] <+xeros720> oh, you can see what they wanted
[3:24:20] <+xeros720> they were married to "build wall, punch wall"
[3:24:29] <jestrfestr> make it so you can punch the wall for combo and rubble
[3:24:46] <+GaspidarIII> tectonics should be a shotgun burts with landslide
[3:24:58] <+tussletoes> I like the idea of some of his abilities draining rubble rather than it drain naturally over time.
[3:25:01] <+xeros720> just make a shit ton of walls
[3:25:04] <+tussletoes> Assuming they're good
[3:25:19] <+xeros720> just got a vision of katamari
[3:25:32] <+xeros720> make a shit ton of walls and they all roll up together and drag enemies with them
[3:25:32] <CynosZilla> maybe they could draw and accumulate damage, till they explode
[3:25:33] <+GaspidarIII> damage
[3:25:36] <LunarRemix> Give armor as a buff around them?
[3:25:56] <+tussletoes> Honestly the PvP augment should just be part of his kit, without the inability to parkour
[3:25:57] <+xeros720> roll around in them?
[3:26:10] <+tussletoes> Same with the bulwark augment, doesn't need to be an augment
[3:26:13] <Andele1503> Make walls hard taunt and make the ball suck enemies in
[3:26:17] <CynosZilla> then give something earthbender like to him.
[3:27:10] <+doc_ock_rokc> personally I perfer a cadamari kinda thing
[3:27:29] <Vexed_Algides> how about creating a wall to send projectiles flying in a cone in front of you?
[3:27:31] <cerazor01> meh
[3:27:34] <+doc_ock_rokc> you hit people and the bolder builds in size and damage for each petrified enemy hit
[3:27:53] <blueflamespirit> new augment: strike
[3:27:55] <jestrfestr> that'd be cool if it worked on landslide
[3:28:00] <+tussletoes> Oh like Rhino's 1 augment, that would work pretty well.
[3:28:27] <+GaspidarIII> rubble should give him stackable invulnerability however his 2 and 4 require set amounts of rubble to be used and have no decay on rubble. his has a percentage multiplier based on rubble amount
[3:28:40] <Murphio_GS> Hey Plague, you playing that shit game?
[3:29:06] <itsbullzie> itsbullzie subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:29:58] <+NmyLogan> hola plague
[3:30:26] <+tussletoes> Atlas can already do a big slam with the Rumbled augment, so they could use that to work off of
[3:30:33] <%itsbullzie> That sounds like a intresting
[3:30:37] <%itsbullzie> move
[3:30:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Rumbled is so bad
[3:31:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:31:03] <%itsbullzie> that honestly sounds like a Hunter x Hunter move
[3:31:05] <+tussletoes> I was so disappointed. Thought they were reworking his kit but it's just some clunky augment that doesn't even let you jump.
[3:31:15] <+tussletoes> At least it makes him tanky, but with my umbral Atlas I don't need that, even
[3:32:35] <%itsbullzie> you like detailed games like this Plague?
[3:33:13] <DeltaPangaea> And ain't it grand that there's so many ways Warframe could be better?
[3:33:16] <Andele1503> It would need to be over a 200x damage multiplier to make up the "no more stat stick no more combo counter melee no more its combo counter"
[3:33:16] <DeltaPangaea> How generous of them
[3:33:29] <LunarRemix> That's interesting. Most people don't even think about that kind of stuff when it comes to games
[3:33:32] <%itsbullzie> actually You talking is enjoyable
[3:33:48] <Monkeyweed21> so far your suggestions are giving him everything rhino and nezha have plus what he already has
[3:34:16] <cowardlord> I'm liking the workshopping
[3:34:37] <+tussletoes> It would really help for one of his abilities to give him DR, yeah. Better than just giving rumblers and bulwarks big numbers.
[3:34:47] <DeltaPangaea> Tap for quick jabs costing energy and hold to consume rubble for BIG PUNCH would be cool as heck
[3:34:54] <+tussletoes> I want a big dick well-rounded kit like Nidus
[3:35:04] <+OwlLightningMage> Nyx's loop is sadness
[3:35:19] <Monkeyweed21> why not tie damage reduction to rumblers ala Nekros?
[3:35:36] <DeltaPangaea> Petrify's still way better than it was when it was a channel at least. God it was bad.
[3:36:47] <cerazor01> You are talking like a Fighting Game Player.
[3:36:47] <Monkeyweed21> wouldn't tying damage reduction AND damage increase to a single ablity be wildly overpowered
[3:37:03] <cerazor01> Yes
[3:37:18] <Zombrocom> Well monkey, tell that to garas glass shield that is 90% DR and literally millions of DPS
[3:37:26] <Zombrocom> Gara is so OP LUL
[3:37:47] <DeltaPangaea> DE's game design is honestly so fucking wonky in so many ways.
[3:37:55] <+tussletoes> We solved Atlas
[3:37:57] <cerazor01> That sounds awful
[3:38:13] <DeltaPangaea> There's very few frames that are really tightly designed to the point every ability is good and useful.
[3:38:24] <Monkeyweed21> @Zombrocom yea but you only get that DPS by repeatedly using your 4 and 1, its not press once for huge DR, press again for huge damage increase
[3:38:25] <%itsbullzie> @zombrocom when you said Garra I thought of Naruto for some reason the show I mean
[3:38:30] <+tussletoes> Trust me, Atlas getting DR would not be overpowered. It would just help a lot
[3:38:33] <$Valdorick> Thank you for coming to Plague's TED talk.
[3:38:47] <cerazor01> No Problem.
[3:38:52] <Zombrocom> I feel like this loop is building up to a big payoff, but the big payoff is just... more resource generation. I would perfer some kind of big spend for big reward that you need to build back up to
[3:39:06] <Vexed_Algides> everything in warframe needs DR or else it gets destroyed. Either that or invisibility.
[3:39:14] <cerazor01> I wasn't talking to you Plague. But uh, no problem.
[3:39:23] <Monkeyweed21> instead of tying damage reduction to a clunky wall why not tie it to rumblers
[3:39:36] <LunarRemix> Some frames are just allowed to have everything so I don't see that much of a problem
[3:39:43] <+tussletoes> I'd rather get rid of his immunity and just give him good DR overall. Don't like to emergency mash 1 to survive when I'm playing base Atlas
[3:39:48] <Zombrocom> I still think you should scrap the wall completely, it's useless and jank
[3:39:49] <%itsbullzie> Cheer100 Cheer100
[3:39:57] <DeltaPangaea> They're 'allowed' to because DE is wonk as fuck.
[3:39:59] <+tussletoes> Wall is cool. Sorry. Has to stay.
[3:40:09] <Monkeyweed21> sometimes a wall can just be a wall
[3:40:14] <$Valdorick> Is that a party of 4 mesas?
[3:40:19] <DeltaPangaea> Like they pretend an energy economy is important, and then give free energy out the ass to people.
[3:40:19] <+tussletoes> hahaha, I still don't know what a Tubeman even is.
[3:40:23] <Zombrocom> I am 99% landslide makes you invincible during it because someone died during it in testing and it crashed the game, so that's going no where
[3:40:25] <+UltraViolet371> obsessed with tubemen and whether or not it's time for hammer
[3:40:30] <Monkeyweed21> not every ability needs to do 5 things
[3:40:50] <DeltaPangaea> I'm pretty sure that Landslide didn't make you invincible on release, so nah
[3:41:01] <+tussletoes> Tyl Regor and the Tubemen sounds like a rock outfit from the 60's
[3:41:22] <elquenosepuedepronunciar> I haven't seen warframe in the last 4 years, and is it just me, or it actually looks significantly better than I remember?
[3:41:31] <+UltraViolet371> Tyl doesn't respect the plat we spent to not be ugly
[3:41:39] <+tussletoes> Thing is, Atlas (Prime, at least) can stay alive well enough as it is, I just want that to come naturally rather than having to mash your abilities
[3:41:43] <Zombrocom> I am pretty sure landslide always made you invincible
[3:41:43] <%itsbullzie> Cheer355
[3:42:09] <DeltaPangaea> I coulda swore it didn't always. But then I'm also dumb so who knows!
[3:42:43] <$Valdorick> sucks a lot
[3:42:47] <Monkeyweed21> i feel like the simplest solution would just be to make rumblers cost rubble in exchange for the rumblers petrifying eneies and taking damage for you ala Nekros
[3:42:47] <Zombrocom> My memory isn't the greatest either. But I am pretty sure. I have been playing him for years now
[3:42:52] <%itsbullzie> ok this game kinda looked RPG like which is not my thing really. Yet this game looks fun honestly
[3:43:18] <cerazor01> It's still TOO much though.
[3:43:26] <+FadingEmber> Frost needs a rework worst than Atlas
[3:43:32] <DeltaPangaea> Slow down the animation and slap more rocks on it.
[3:43:33] <Zombrocom> It's a... MMORPGShooterGrindThing with optional fishing and space sim.
[3:44:07] <Andele1503> Rumblers already scale in size with power strength
[3:44:15] <cerazor01> But they do already?
[3:44:19] <DeltaPangaea> I wouldn't mind if you could like
[3:44:23] <rockywm> is this game good?
[3:44:26] <DeltaPangaea> Hold the rumbler button to make bigger ones.
[3:44:40] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is fun.
[3:44:50] <Monkeyweed21> Tectonics sucks but in an inoffensive way, he just needs DR and more rubble, both of which would make Rumblers an actually good ultimate
[3:44:51] <LunarRemix> It's okay?
[3:44:53] <DeltaPangaea> Warframe is the best worst game
[3:45:01] <DoostCola> it's the ultimate time sink
[3:45:04] <Flamethrowerman09> Last time i played this game was 5 or so years ago. I stopped playing this game when they made you start off in a ship
[3:45:08] <Zombrocom> The Best Worst game is a great description
[3:45:09] <DeltaPangaea> In so many ways it's shit. But it's entertaining so I guess it's good?
[3:45:20] <+OwlLightningMage> The Warframes are the most fun thing in WF. Everything else is kinda a mess
[3:45:34] <Zombrocom> There is a ton of things I hate about warframe, but also a ton of things I love
[3:45:43] <%itsbullzie> What about the story of the game, is it like other RPG game stories or...
[3:45:45] <Zombrocom> It's a glorious mess
[3:46:00] <cerazor01> The story has been so contradictory and vague.
[3:46:07] <DeltaPangaea> God I DESPISE Operators.
[3:46:09] <+OwlLightningMage> The problem with Atlas is while he's not bad, his kit is still disjointed to use.
[3:46:10] <Zombrocom> Much like the game itself, the story is both amazing and utterly terrible
[3:46:14] <DeltaPangaea> I hate them so much
[3:46:31] <DeltaPangaea> Well Atlas has pretty good armor, at least.
[3:46:33] <Flamethrowerman09> The only classes i ever had were Excalibur and Rhino
[3:46:34] <Zombrocom> The story peaks at about 70 hours in and then is kinda a mess
[3:46:41] <DeltaPangaea> So saying he doesn't have any DR is inaccurate.
[3:47:09] <Zombrocom> Atlas has one of the highest base EHPs in the game
[3:47:31] <+OwlLightningMage> Numbers don't equal fun. Look at Octavia LUL
[3:47:32] <Zombrocom> With adaptation you are covered for all content honestly
[3:47:33] <CynosZilla> A lot of frames have this "pre-parkour 2.0" design mentality.
[3:47:38] <%itsbullzie> "Giving numbers" sounds familiar
[3:47:41] <DeltaPangaea> And apparently DE is giving up on all their warframes having at least one dud ability by letting you slap something else on there.
[3:47:52] <DeltaPangaea> Even if some of them are duds too.
[3:47:57] <+OwlLightningMage> Octavia is really powerful and absolutely terrible
[3:48:04] <+tussletoes> Imo Atlas Prime is tanky enough, but I wish you didn't have to spam so much to keep your health up
[3:48:08] <Flamethrowerman09> I always thought that Oberon looked like Alphas from Zetman.
[3:48:09] <Zombrocom> I am slapping larva on atlas and never looking back
[3:48:15] <+ziplockfriday> is this on the steel path?
[3:48:30] <+tussletoes> I'd rather half of Atlas' useless kit could be geared more towards something other than dmg
[3:48:36] <DianaTheAscian> what frame upsets u the most btw?
[3:48:40] <DeltaPangaea> 100 is baseline for frames now since the rework a bit ago.
[3:48:42] <CynosZilla> armor is not that good. Damage reduction is more valuable in the game right now.
[3:48:44] <Vexed_Algides> it's a system that doesn't really apply anymore, when we're getting all 95% DR on things
[3:48:50] <DeltaPangaea> No frame has less than 100, which I believe is 25% damage reduction.
[3:49:06] <LunarRemix> It's interesting how shields don't even enter the discussion. Like building for shields on anyone but Hildryn is just impossible
[3:49:09] <Andele1503> Honestly, all i want from atlas is a better 1 augment than path of statues that lets him get energy manipulation/effective efficiency or cast it from rubble
[3:49:12] <%itsbullzie> So this game is more for Gameplay huh
[3:49:15] <DeltaPangaea> Nah, shields are alright now.
[3:49:23] <DeltaPangaea> 'Alright'
[3:49:28] <CynosZilla> there is little benefity between 200 and 1500 armor.
[3:49:28] <Zombrocom> Actually, since shield gating changes, shield builds are quite viable
[3:49:37] <DeltaPangaea> Between the quick recharge if they don't break and native 25% damage reduction, they're nice.
[3:49:40] <Zombrocom> On some frames at least
[3:49:41] <DeltaPangaea> And the gating yeah
[3:49:42] <+OwlLightningMage> Shields are much better
[3:49:51] <Andele1503> otherwise max range high efficiency 105 duration and 80-90% strength atlas does solid damage even if his game loop isnt very engaging
[3:49:53] <DeltaPangaea> Uh, little benefit between 200 and 1500?
[3:49:59] <Vexed_Algides> Protea works because of shield gating, shields right now are certainly better than before
[3:50:16] <Zombrocom> Arcane Aegis and other shield generation things let you explot the fuck outta gating
[3:50:18] <$Valdorick> The best boss? The Sargent.
[3:50:22] <$Valdorick> Just an HP pool
[3:50:23] <jestrfestr> if there weren't they would all be even more of a joke
[3:50:29] <+FadingEmber> Protea's 2 might be good for auto tracking the adds
[3:50:33] <+tussletoes> It's pretty funny how they try to stop you from doing too much damage every change they get
[3:50:37] <CynosZilla> from about 60% to 80%? yeah, not much benefit.
[3:50:42] <+tussletoes> So it just ends up being kind of a waiting game
[3:50:49] <Vexed_Algides> thing with armor is that it doesn't matter by itself because of enemy scaling
[3:51:01] <DeltaPangaea> 200 armor is 40% reduction, 1500 is 83%
[3:51:35] <+luftraumm1> live nezha especially deluxe
[3:51:43] <+luftraumm1> love *
[3:51:46] <Andele1503> nah, it works, valkyr can stick around for a short bit on steel path without shield gate abuse, trinity meanwhile needs her link or blessing (or both) up or abusing shield gate effects
[3:51:48] <+UltraViolet371> @itsbullzie imo the story is fantastic, consistently fascinating and surprising and cool, but "plot" only actively happens for a few quests deep in the game so you have to like the gameplay to even see any of it
[3:51:52] <+tussletoes> Nezha has a pretty good kit
[3:52:24] <%itsbullzie> @ultraviolet371 I have not played it so I will take your word for it.
[3:52:26] <+tussletoes> Wish DE took the positive feedback from his rework and do more, but I guess Vauban's and Ember's reworks were kind of a mixed bag for most
[3:52:35] <Zombrocom> With steel fiber and max rubble, you can easily break 2K armour, which puts you at almost 90% DR right there. Add adaptation to that and you as tanky as you will ever need to be.
[3:52:44] <cerazor01> What an odd Mark Hamill impression.
[3:52:50] <%itsbullzie> I am just trying to understand the game.
[3:52:51] <DeltaPangaea> Adaptation is so busted good.
[3:53:09] <+FadingEmber> those are some weak motes
[3:53:12] <+tussletoes> With umbral Atlas, his armor maxed + adaptation makes him really beefy. Again, though, you have to put the work in, and it can get tedious, which I get
[3:53:16] <DeltaPangaea> DE's just got no sense of balance. Hell, the single-effect Status mods stayed at FIFTEEN percent for YEARS
[3:53:18] <CynosZilla> by the way damage scales, going from 40 to 80% reduction from armor doesn't do much.
[3:54:23] <+luftraumm1> his kit is not conducive to his design
[3:54:27] <DeltaPangaea> Warframe balance discussions about 'that would be too strong' are moot because it's all over the place. Like Octavia getting to do whatever she likes, or everything with Gara.
[3:54:44] <DeltaPangaea> And DE's efforts to gate power behind fiddliness
[3:54:54] <+luftraumm1> if he's supposed to be a pugilist he's punching very little comparatively
[3:54:57] <Zombrocom> His kit is just 4 powers they thought sounded cool and threw together, they dont work together with synergy the way new warframes kits do
[3:55:00] <CynosZilla> most problems with warframe combat comes from how much damage we take from enemies. It is either nothing or instakill (pre shield gate)
[3:55:01] <cerazor01> Change Altas kit. Meta changes. Need to change Atlas's kit again.
[3:55:05] <ninetales8491> @PlagueOfGripes didnt think i would see you play war frame
[3:55:08] <LunarRemix> Adaptation is a godsent
[3:55:22] <+tussletoes> It's a lawless wasteland here in warframe land
[3:55:24] <DougintheTrench> Heya Plague.
[3:55:32] <jestrfestr> you buy main BP from store no?
[3:55:41] <+OwlLightningMage> Plague sold Pat on Warframe
[3:55:42] <+luftraumm1> equinox is the worst frame to craft
[3:55:45] <Monkeyweed21> I cant believe Pat got you into Warframe
[3:56:07] <DougintheTrench> Knowing more than Pat is a laudable and quite easy goal in life.
[3:56:09] <LunarRemix> You should apply to their twitch program so you can get free stuff lol
[3:56:10] <+ziplockfriday> you can buy the frame in the market for plat.
[3:56:12] <theloganbrand> What does the Tenno's bootyhole look like?
[3:56:12] <DianaTheAscian> did u invent warframe?
[3:56:15] <%itsbullzie> War Frame? That is what it's called? crap I heard so much but never listened to anyone about it.
[3:56:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Equinox is more complicated for reason
[3:56:17] <DeltaPangaea> Warframe is one of those things I get annoyingly annoyed over.
[3:56:17] <+tussletoes> Equinox's farm is a hell of a thing
[3:56:21] <+luftraumm1> day + night
[3:56:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Her
[3:56:22] <DeltaPangaea> Like I wish I got less annoyed.
[3:56:26] <Jodoxk1> Yeah but that costs plat @ziplockfriday
[3:56:31] <SunsetJack> Equinox Prime is easier...?
[3:56:33] <Zombrocom> It always feels weird when I see people I know from other things play warframe, I have been playing this game for so long, when it was still super niche. Can't get used to the fact it's one of the most popular PC games around now
[3:56:41] <+tussletoes> I get annoyed at Warframe, but out of love. Like Dark Souls. I love hating them.
[3:56:54] <DeltaPangaea> I get annoyed because I wish it was better.
[3:57:06] <+tussletoes> You ever see that steam review meme that's like "This is my favorite game. Not recommended"? Those are the best games.
[3:57:12] <+luftraumm1> I wish they put day in one boss and night in another
[3:57:21] <+OwlLightningMage> We complain because we want the game to be better
[3:57:32] <CynosZilla> Warframe is a fun game to play casually.
[3:57:35] <DeltaPangaea> I love inhuman faceless robotish things like frames, which is one reason the Operators aggravated me so much.
[3:57:43] <+luftraumm1> wf is always on the edge of greatness
[3:57:52] <+ziplockfriday> easier to farm plat than farm the frame
[3:57:56] <+tussletoes> That's this entire community
[3:57:57] <Zombrocom> Just turn your operator into a faceless robot
[3:57:59] <%itsbullzie> Atlas is a Titan God right?
[3:58:03] <DianaTheAscian> very true
[3:58:09] <DougintheTrench> Just cause you can spot a hole doesn't mean you can fill it.
[3:58:11] <SunsetJack> I stop playing Warframe cause I got burned out.
[3:58:16] <+tussletoes> I feel bad for DE sometimes, since they do tend to listen to feedback more than most devs, but EVERYONE has something to say
[3:58:18] <DeltaPangaea> Because not only are you dumping on any kind of tension due to your actual character being safe in an egg chair miles away, you're doing it with a goddamn boring-ass human
[3:58:21] <+luftraumm1> atlas is a titan yes
[3:58:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> atlas is great
[3:58:24] <DeltaPangaea> When you pulled people in with cool space robots
[3:58:27] <Andele1503> Correction: people that dont play something a lot are shitty at fixing the design issues with it
[3:58:55] <+tussletoes> And that's why bosses don't let you do damage.
[3:59:10] <DeltaPangaea> They focus on mechanical effectiveness rather than elegant and smart design, yeah.
[3:59:19] <pillowwasp> Balance always seemed like one of the shittiest tasks in game design
[3:59:20] <CynosZilla> I mean, so far the best buff DE gave to Trinity was to allow her to cast her skill on the air. :v
[3:59:37] <SunsetJack> God, I remember when Excal was a pain to farm before lol
[3:59:50] <$Valdorick> That is a very fabulous Excal
[3:59:55] <+TIME_PUNCHER> wish the colours weren't so limited
[4:00:36] <+tussletoes> Tigris will always be fun. At least Sancti is still good
[4:01:08] <+tussletoes> I just use a pet or weapon mod to heal Excal, too much of a bother otherwise
[4:01:45] <DeltaPangaea> I'm glad I got a full stack of Grace while Scarlet Spear was around.
[4:01:53] <Zombrocom> I managed to farm a complete 21 stack of every arcane during scarlet spear. Feels fantastic TBH
[4:01:58] <DeltaPangaea> So I don't gotta worry about that anymore.
[4:02:04] <+doc_ock_rokc> Excalibur!" "Excalibur!" "From the United Kingdom!" "I'm looking for Heaven!" "I'm going to California!
[4:02:09] <ezlo_86> Cheers from Scotland!
[4:02:09] <+BinaryFireball> plague what do you think of the art direction of warframe?
[4:02:11] <+TIME_PUNCHER> it's a bold move
[4:02:12] <jestrfestr> I play mirage
[4:02:13] <alextrebeken> aesthetis
[4:02:14] <jestrfestr> shes fun
[4:02:15] <LunarRemix> Clown fetish?
[4:02:15] <+TallTimber> Mirage for fashion frame
[4:02:18] <Monkeyweed21> I enjoy blinding people
[4:02:23] <CynosZilla> becase mirrage is a little monster
[4:02:25] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Have you seen Explosvie Leguredomain?
[4:02:27] <+PowerArmorMeow> kril needs a rework
[4:02:28] <Zombrocom> You play mirage for to make a weapon shoot three times
[4:02:35] <+Solutha> i play warframe for the guns, mirage gives more gun
[4:02:38] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Mirage reminds me of Apex. Remember Apex?
[4:02:56] <+TallTimber> ohhhh i remember this
[4:02:58] <+tussletoes> You only play for the guns? It's okay, you can say you play Inaros/Chroma.
[4:03:04] <+TallTimber> lech krill ass hat.
[4:03:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> @TIME_PUNCHER sounds like a titanfall knockoff
[4:03:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> mirage +boomstick = 4 boom sticks
[4:03:28] <+TallTimber> There is an orokitty on that platform.
[4:03:46] <Zombrocom> Excal = Press 4, swing blade. Sometimes press 2 if threatened. That's it.
[4:03:56] <LunarRemix> And ass.
[4:03:57] <CynosZilla> Umbra was quite a good choice for scarlet spear.
[4:04:01] <Sark_Eset> Or Map Nuke Mirage
[4:04:01] <DoostCola> mirage is CUTE
[4:04:01] <Monkeyweed21> i like blinding people
[4:04:02] <+tokenreefer> support is the way to go
[4:04:17] <+PowerArmorMeow> pretty much
[4:04:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> Same
[4:04:22] <+luftraumm1> you using the deluxe excal?
[4:04:29] <Zombrocom> Like liches? Why the hell can new players spawn liches.
[4:04:30] <+TIME_PUNCHER> I can't believe they added a mechanic that doubles grinding for frames, the madmen
[4:04:32] <+tussletoes> Being a Warframe "vet" makes me feel like I can unleash eldritch knowledge on new players whenever I want
[4:04:48] <+tussletoes> It is fun to take new players through the game, though
[4:04:51] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes I think new players are cool and all but I fear I cheese it to much for them to enjoy the game
[4:04:54] <+tokenreefer> I live on that friendship
[4:04:57] <OldOnyx> most mirage players I know play her to stare at her ass and then rationalize it with "big damage"
[4:05:03] <+UltraViolet371> Always get them in excavation missions and have to make sure I'm not imprisoning them
[4:05:11] <+TIME_PUNCHER> I'm a Tenno and This Is Deep
[4:05:18] <Monkeyweed21> mY WaRfraMe iS sTrOnG
[4:05:22] <Andele1503> Alternatively, give them a nikana or orthos prime and tell em "go learn shit, you can kill anything with this and pressure point, fury, reach, true steel and organ shatter
[4:05:23] <LunarRemix> Tumblr.
[4:05:24] <Vexed_Algides> yeeeah their quotes are c r i n g e
[4:05:26] <%itsbullzie> when I think of Excalibur, I think of the sword of Arthur Pentagon
[4:05:26] <+doc_ock_rokc> @OldOnyx but wisp exists
[4:05:30] <ninetales8491> LUL
[4:05:30] <+tokenreefer> warframe TUMBLR
[4:05:34] <KaiserMario> Don't make fun of his blog... He is trying his best!
[4:05:43] <+luftraumm1> makes a lot of sense operators are teens
[4:05:46] <Monkeyweed21> I turned off the operator
[4:05:50] <+tussletoes> "The grineer used to be builders. But now they only make war..."
[4:05:51] <+PowerArmorMeow> I like helping others so Play support frames when I teach my friends how to play
[4:05:52] <+doc_ock_rokc> 1 slash dash
[4:05:56] <%itsbullzie> Arthur Pendragon I meant
[4:05:57] <+doc_ock_rokc> and 3 stab stab
[4:05:58] <+ziplockfriday> deep
[4:05:58] <jestrfestr> turning off operator comms is like the first thing i did after second dream
[4:06:03] <+tussletoes> Okay kid, don't you have a To KIll a Mockingbird chapter analysis to do?
[4:06:07] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Tenno truly are the Henry Rollins of space
[4:06:07] <Zombrocom> His 1 is literally the same as atlas's 1
[4:06:09] <+tussletoes> Stupid operators.
[4:06:14] <Zombrocom> But worse
[4:06:14] <Monkeyweed21> only 1 hose at a time
[4:06:19] <+UltraViolet371> The corpus remind me of the orokin. Selfish. Greedy. *gasp* such truth
[4:06:26] <cerazor01> I don't like how the Weakpoints on the Bosses are very hard to identify
[4:06:29] <+luftraumm1> I think it's supposed to be damage type?
[4:06:57] <+tussletoes> Excal's 1 can do... SORT OF decent damage if you use exalted blade with a good build. It's a fun thing to do sometimes.
[4:06:59] <+tokenreefer> boss? where?
[4:07:08] <+doc_ock_rokc> OR BOTH
[4:07:28] <DeltaPangaea> I picked Volt when I started playing back in closed beta.
[4:07:30] <Sajnare> What's that UI colour scheme? Looks nice
[4:07:36] <DeltaPangaea> Shock was shitty back then too.
[4:07:39] <%itsbullzie> You know, I wish people could create a really funny game where you can pull pranks on people. Such as making them shit there pants and so on.
[4:07:50] <DeltaPangaea> Shock has never been good.
[4:07:52] <+tussletoes> That would be great.
[4:08:06] <cerazor01> For Completionist sake?
[4:08:11] <cerazor01> or for some shenangians
[4:08:11] <Monkeyweed21> people sleeping on thunder buff
[4:08:16] <+luftraumm1> you built umbrage though
[4:08:20] <jestrfestr> Fashion ecal
[4:08:21] <DeltaPangaea> That's not Shock being good
[4:08:21] <+PowerArmorMeow> I think I'll ignore this helminth system
[4:08:24] <jestrfestr> its the end game
[4:08:26] <DeltaPangaea> That's the augment being good.
[4:08:27] <+tussletoes> Keep your sanity, don't do Grendel. Just buy his ass.
[4:08:30] <jestrfestr> excal*
[4:08:30] <LunarRemix> You know I actually liked those Grendel missions
[4:08:36] <DeltaPangaea> Shock itself is garbo
[4:08:38] <%itsbullzie> Cool
[4:08:45] <+doc_ock_rokc> main bp?
[4:08:51] <Monkeyweed21> just run to the end
[4:08:52] <+PowerArmorMeow> I don't like the idea of subsuming warframes
[4:08:54] <+ziplockfriday> you dont lose the locator
[4:08:55] <+tussletoes> Maybe I'm biased from Brozime's streams but the Grendel missions look like distilled suffering
[4:09:11] <+tussletoes> Sybaris gang.
[4:09:12] <+luftraumm1> ugh sybaris
[4:09:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> gib build
[4:09:26] <Murphio_GS> God I hate how this game looks
[4:09:37] <%itsbullzie> You being angry is still more calm then my calmness. You are pretty tamed compared to most people I know.
[4:09:38] <cerazor01> yes
[4:09:44] <+PowerArmorMeow> it doesn't look bad?
[4:09:52] <Monkeyweed21> sybaris should work fine
[4:09:55] <jestrfestr> vectis
[4:09:59] <jestrfestr> or rubico
[4:09:59] <+TIME_PUNCHER> angry farmer dot com
[4:10:20] <+ziplockfriday> dread
[4:10:25] <%itsbullzie> @time_puncher isn't he an insane Farmer
[4:10:28] <+luftraumm1> Rubico is p good
[4:10:39] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:10:48] <+PowerArmorMeow> all my friends quit the game
[4:10:58] <+tussletoes> He's blowing up your DMs
[4:11:00] <+TIME_PUNCHER> @itsbullzie angry, insane, tomayto tomahto
[4:11:12] <DeltaPangaea> Why can we not block Stalker already for harassment
[4:11:20] <funwashere> Hows being a space ninja going?
[4:11:23] <+siffles> I still wish they'd give us a thing in Similaris where you can buy it and just get a shortcut directly to the simulacrum
[4:11:25] <+tussletoes> I always leave Stalker on read
[4:11:30] <+PowerArmorMeow> @deltapangaea cuz stalker hacks
[4:11:30] <+tussletoes> Just to increase his pain
[4:11:47] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It's cute that Stalker-kun thinks he's a threat
[4:12:04] <+tussletoes> Honestly Prisma Grinlok is lots of fun
[4:12:22] <%itsbullzie> @time_puncher hmm they aren't the same, then again it could be both. the Tomato Tamato
[4:13:33] <+PowerArmorMeow> kinda hope we get a quest to deal with stalker personally
[4:13:39] <%itsbullzie> I hate Sniper Rifles
[4:13:42] <cerazor01> I wonder if you could make Patrick Star in Warframe?
[4:13:59] <LunarRemix> PRobably
[4:14:00] <%itsbullzie> I hope Sniper Rifles Die
[4:14:01] <DeltaPangaea> I personally hope we get a quest to deal with our own operator personally. Lemme turn 'em into a void ghost or something
[4:14:17] <+ziplockfriday> no
[4:14:20] <+TallTimber> Is therere a differnce between a head and a critical spot?
[4:14:41] <VroomSoon> Magnetic procs
[4:14:45] <Zombrocom> He mag procs you
[4:14:47] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah. Mag procs
[4:14:57] <DeltaPangaea> He mag procs you CONSTANTLY, it's an absolute shit.
[4:15:05] <Zombrocom> Also, remember you don't need to fight his floating head form, you can just run to the mech part
[4:15:12] <+tussletoes> Stropha is great, better than Redeemer from experience
[4:15:23] <+tussletoes> I think you wanna do a charge attack build, but even without it, it can be good
[4:16:21] <+PowerArmorMeow> shattering impact
[4:17:32] <Zombrocom> Just a bit better
[4:17:42] <+ziplockfriday> berserk does that help heavy speed
[4:17:54] <cerazor01> looks like you are finger gunning people
[4:18:07] <Zombrocom> Yeah, attack speed improves the recoil part of the heavy animation
[4:18:14] <+tussletoes> Wow! That sounds awful!
[4:18:15] <Zombrocom> Charge speed makes it come out faster
[4:18:24] <CalderGaming> you can pick the normal mode too right?
[4:18:24] <+SoulDragonix> steel path vay hek?
[4:19:05] <DeltaPangaea> "Look brothers! TITS. AHAHAHAHAHA."
[4:19:17] <+tussletoes> I can't play with too many speed modifiers on, I don't want Volt's buffs
[4:19:25] <OperatorJo_> quiettHA
[4:19:29] <Vexed_Algides> "Why are these fools still breathing my air"
[4:19:33] <Zombrocom> I WILL PERSONALLY THROW YOUR BELOVED LOTUS, INTO THE SUN
[4:19:38] <+tussletoes> "Aaaeaeuaeueuuguh"
[4:19:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> Vey Hek is a bunch of ham of cheese
[4:19:56] <DeltaPangaea> "You tried to POP its GLISTENING MAGNIFICENCE!"
[4:19:59] <Zombrocom> He has a ton of good ones, yeah
[4:20:07] <+tussletoes> Vay Hek... gone too soon. Love you, baby.
[4:20:11] <IntrepidEye> TENNO MAGGOTS
[4:20:29] <Vexed_Algides> oh, someone got him early
[4:20:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> ARE YOU READYF OR A SACRIFICE!
[4:20:38] <%itsbullzie> maybe it is easier?
[4:20:54] <Vexed_Algides> yeah that's the line
[4:20:56] <Vexed_Algides> chicken time
[4:21:06] <+doc_ock_rokc> Super mega chicken!
[4:21:06] <+D00msDayDan> time for rules of nature
[4:21:23] <+doc_ock_rokc> yes
[4:21:26] <DeltaPangaea> Yeah, any time a boss finally gives up and drops their invuln phases they die instantly.
[4:21:32] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Speedy Gonzales
[4:21:41] <+tussletoes> They're just delaying the inevitable
[4:21:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes The main bp?
[4:22:05] <+TIME_PUNCHER> Look at them, they come to this place STILL BREATHING MY AIR
[4:22:16] <VroomSoon> Mag is really good against him
[4:22:16] <+ForlornCarton> Isn't the blueprint in the market?
[4:22:17] <+doc_ock_rokc> You get that in the market @PlagueOfGripes
[4:22:38] <VroomSoon> Magnetize makes all of your shots hit his weak points
[4:22:39] <DianaTheAscian> i do
[4:22:42] <+tussletoes> I- I play... m-m
[4:22:44] <+doc_ock_rokc> I play mag on the odd occasion
[4:23:03] <TheAsylumCat> I started with mag and it was terrible
[4:23:04] <+TIME_PUNCHER> i chose mag as my starter
[4:23:04] <Andele1503> Who plays the low duration high range high strength 334 nuke mag here in chat?
[4:23:18] <+tussletoes> Listen, I'll defend Mag, but choosing her as a starter? God save your soul.
[4:23:19] <CynosZilla> Mag was my starter frame. I like her, just can't play her.
[4:23:32] <+PowerArmorMeow> I occasionally play Mag
[4:23:41] <cerazor01> Vay Heks design makes me think they took some Moa technology.
[4:23:42] <+tussletoes> I remember Woolie picked her, and I was so confused because I'd never seen someone do that before.
[4:24:03] <+doc_ock_rokc> woolie likes casters apparently
[4:24:11] <CynosZilla> scan it
[4:24:20] <+doc_ock_rokc> eah a special canistor
[4:24:24] <DeltaPangaea> Evil characters that revel in being evil?
[4:24:39] <DeltaPangaea> Like zero restraint
[4:24:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> Vey hek is great a unrepentent asshat
[4:25:06] <%itsbullzie> me gonna fall asleep while watching
[4:25:09] <Nickdick96> they're basically enjoying their evil build, which happened to be themself
[4:25:26] <+tussletoes> Nef Anyo is a fun asshole too\
[4:25:58] <LunarRemix> The fact that he's screaming makes it funny lol
[4:25:59] <Vexed_Algides> nobody knows
[4:26:02] <Andele1503> nezha 2 (much like atlas 3) are crucial for their damage output
[4:26:03] <+tussletoes> Warframe is the bitrate killer.
[4:26:12] <+PowerArmorMeow> to be fare vay hek was fed to ghouls by Tengus
[4:26:23] <+PowerArmorMeow> *fair
[4:26:35] <+tussletoes> Even Lotus needed him to shut up
[4:26:57] <+TallTimber> Space mom FeelsBadMan
[4:27:11] <DeltaPangaea> I never cared for Lotus.
[4:27:27] <DeltaPangaea> Not in the slightest. Lemme just have Darvo all the time rather than just Clem-missions.
[4:27:50] <+UltraViolet371> Yes please, Darvo is precious
[4:29:21] <+tussletoes> Did they ever say when that "new player experience" thing was coming out?
[4:29:31] <VroomSoon> August 25th
[4:29:37] <LunarRemix> Going to kill her when you get the choice?
[4:29:41] <+tussletoes> Oh really? Okay, cool
[4:29:54] <+ziplockfriday> hate authority
[4:29:54] <+TallTimber> She was there when we woke up from the scary sleep BibleThump I needs her to hold my hand BibleThump
[4:30:12] <DeltaPangaea> I'm absolutely gonna kill her if I get the choice, but I'd rather off my Operator if I get the option.
[4:30:26] <DeltaPangaea> I'd do both if I can though!
[4:30:40] <Andele1503> On a completely different note, Plague since you kinda like some vtubers, did you hear that the slav adidas lion girl with the voice of a sporty little sister apparently likes Warframe too?
[4:30:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:30:58] <$Valdorick> and then he died.
[4:31:01] <LunarRemix> It will be seen as the bad choice but so many people will pick the kill everyone option lol
[4:31:31] <$Valdorick> Knock back McGoo
[4:31:32] <Andele1503> profit taker
[4:31:36] <Andele1503> aka bounce spam
[4:31:41] <+tussletoes> Oh god, the damage types on profit taker.
[4:31:44] <Zombrocom> Profit taker
[4:31:45] <DeltaPangaea> Profit Taker is such a PAAAAIN
[4:31:47] <Vexed_Algides> profit taker can go straight to hell
[4:31:55] <+doc_ock_rokc> Groffit
[4:31:56] <+PowerArmorMeow> profit taker
[4:32:12] <$Rivalshotzgp> What about the nekros farm fight
[4:32:16] <+PowerArmorMeow> supposedly there's 1 more orb mother?
[4:32:19] <$Valdorick> "Did you decide to play a frame that isn't immune to knockdowns? ENJOY NOT PLAYING THE GAME NOW!"
[4:32:44] <StarvingPenguinGod> chroma dmg buffs HahaDoge
[4:32:45] <Vexed_Algides> exploiter orb is way better
[4:33:17] <Andele1503> im ok with profit taker, but either the damage to shields or archgun parts need to be tweaked down (damage by combined elements taken or if you have the element on gun the gun deals all damage) or the orb itself should take damage from normal guns (even if reduced), but what 100% NEEDS to happen is to make prime sure footed block bounce effects ontop of knockdown/stagger
[4:33:26] <DeltaPangaea> There's one orb that's just sitting in a lake somewhere if I recall.
[4:33:28] <+PowerArmorMeow> profit taker sucks cuz there's so much going on
[4:33:32] <Andele1503> sorry for wall o text
[4:33:39] <Sajnare> Chroma's 4 gives extra money at the end
[4:33:54] <DeltaPangaea> If you removed the constant enemy spawning from Profit Taker it wouldn't be anywhere near as much of a pain.
[4:34:18] <+PowerArmorMeow> or atleast controlled spawning
[4:34:30] <Andele1503> I remember the first week when nekros could desecrate profit taker and then again the same happening with exploiter removing the nuke
[4:34:37] <+SarcFa> that's why every good profit taker group has at least one person dedicated to mob killing
[4:34:45] <+PowerArmorMeow> it feels like a war with all the enemies And I like that feeling
[4:34:50] <funwashere> Death by particle effects LUL
[4:34:51] <+Senotaki> Why are these fools still ready for a sacrifice?! This is unacceptable.
[4:35:15] <VroomSoon> He flies away
[4:35:15] <DeltaPangaea> "I killed his robot body and he just left I guess I win???"
[4:35:19] <Vexed_Algides> I'm pretty sure the grineer just keep cloning the bosses
[4:35:29] <huskarl_zap> Damn sic pauldrons brah
[4:35:47] <cerazor01> Is Vay Hek like DEAD dead?
[4:35:58] <cerazor01> or like the other Grineer characters who seem to keep coming back
[4:36:00] <+PowerArmorMeow> be nice if we had a way to manipulate the drops
[4:36:29] <huskarl_zap> New plan, Just start blasting.
[4:38:36] <huskarl_zap> Is this the guy you have to grind in the open world for?
[4:38:37] <blueflamespirit> what will you add to make it better?
[4:38:57] <VroomSoon> He isn't dead. He flies away
[4:39:05] <+D00msDayDan> you can see him detach and fly away during the death animation
[4:39:08] <DeltaPangaea> I mean you absolutely don't kill him. His core part ejects and flies off.
[4:39:21] <+gerahwar> You had the biggest gun
[4:39:30] <CynosZilla> damage to the adds?
[4:39:33] <+SarcFa> I'm guessing you did all the damage phase 2 in mech
[4:39:35] <Nickdick96> Ork Magik
[4:39:47] <DougintheTrench> You did most of the 0 damage.
[4:39:49] <Vexed_Algides> the plan worked
[4:40:05] <huskarl_zap> Le quirky ai voice over
[4:40:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> well did he kill anybody else
[4:41:11] <LeftOverPizza13> i'm not looking forward to getting that again
[4:41:18] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> yes, good, sacrifice them to the moistness
[4:41:31] <+northsouthmiddledakota> is this for the thing that eats powers?
[4:41:38] <+SarcFa> is this frame farming for that new ability switching thing?
[4:41:55] <LunarRemix> That Simaris is going to be a pain.
[4:41:59] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Do you find the fact that nidus give subsume larva pleasing master @plagueofgripes
[4:42:05] <LunarRemix> HIs stuff is like 50K per piece
[4:42:43] <OldOnyx> frosts 2 would be decent for nekros if it could reliably freeze (desecrate rolls twice on shattered enemies) but frost can't be allowed to be useful even as food
[4:42:53] <+xeros720> there was a 1 in front of all those zeroes
[4:42:56] <DeltaPangaea> ).1 damage seven million times.
[4:43:00] <DeltaPangaea> 0.1
[4:43:06] <DeltaPangaea> It's just rounding.
[4:43:30] <DeltaPangaea> Dispensary?
[4:43:32] <Vexed_Algides> close enough to suppository
[4:43:33] <+FadingEmber> Did you get a second Protea for Helmith?
[4:43:36] <+PowerArmorMeow> may they aren't zeroes, maybe they were decimals
[4:43:49] <LeftOverPizza13> ivara cute
[4:43:53] <Sajnare> Ivara is super nice for open world hunts
[4:44:02] <DeltaPangaea> Ivara can swooce past laser tripwires.
[4:44:08] <DeltaPangaea> With her Augment.
[4:44:18] <DeltaPangaea> So you can just waltz through spy vaults
[4:44:19] <Zombrocom> I only use ivara for that one riven challenge where you have to do a survival without killing someone
[4:44:37] <DeltaPangaea> Ivara's Stalk has ZERO REASON to restrict her to walking
[4:44:44] <DeltaPangaea> Since you can fuckin' roll to go faster anyway.
[4:45:02] <DeltaPangaea> So it's just fiddly bullshit
[4:45:10] <Zombrocom> More of a jump double jump roll actually
[4:45:17] <Vexed_Algides> or just wukong
[4:45:22] <$Valdorick> I can't wait to use Molt or Fire walking on Ivara
[4:45:22] <+tussletoes> Or just Ash, he's fun, at least.
[4:45:23] <ZComiX> is mag any kgood?
[4:45:26] <Zombrocom> Or you can just use Wukong, who can USE HIS CLOUD TO GO THROUGH LASERS TOO
[4:45:29] <+hellsquad2> See I just go Gauss and just Speed
[4:45:34] <$Valdorick> and move at normal run speed while invised
[4:45:38] <+FadingEmber> I just use Wisp her passive is great.
[4:45:44] <CynosZilla> but loki doesn't have sleep arrow :v
[4:45:45] <+tussletoes> The duration is rough, yeah.
[4:45:49] <Zombrocom> Fucking wukong man
[4:45:50] <+PowerArmorMeow> I just use ivara to fish and hunt
[4:46:01] <+tussletoes> Some people use stealth Wisp and I just can't keep up with that shit.
[4:46:10] <DeltaPangaea> Few games aggravate me in their game design decisions more than Warframe.
[4:46:16] <DeltaPangaea> Like it'd be SO EASY TO BE BETTER
[4:46:20] <DeltaPangaea> Why do they not
[4:46:27] <DeltaPangaea> Augh
[4:46:27] <$Valdorick> wait, how does Stealth Wisp work? She's only invised while in the air.
[4:46:29] <OldOnyx> could you imagine if Loki's teleport actually killed the enemy it targeted and is 4 just killed everything you could see?
[4:46:33] <%hellsquad2> hellsquad2 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:46:33] <Andele1503> Rolling guard is solid
[4:46:35] <CynosZilla> Ash invisibility is not that bad now. You have a few seconds once the skill ends where the enemies still don't see you.
[4:46:36] <OldOnyx> *his 4
[4:46:55] <CynosZilla> Still, he is more aimed to combat than stealth
[4:46:59] <+FadingEmber> @Valdorick you in the are most of the time anyways
[4:47:05] <+FadingEmber> *air
[4:47:10] <$Valdorick> fair
[4:47:15] <Andele1503> Ash, like Ivara, aint frames for you
[4:47:29] <Zombrocom> Stealth wisp, you can keep yourself in the air easier, but also, her 2 makes you invisible even on the ground for it's duration
[4:47:31] <cerazor01> why is he huddling like a fucking Gremlin?
[4:47:51] <+hellsquad2> See I remember back when I tried to play stealthy, then I just decided its much quicker to smash everything in my path like a mongoloid
[4:47:51] <Murphio_GS> To look like a ninja or some such bs
[4:48:31] <$Valdorick> She should just be slower, and let you sprint
[4:48:36] <OldOnyx> meh, I use the umbra katana for extra invis duration between casting 2 on Ash.
[4:48:57] <+tussletoes> Katana stealth with Ash's finishers is also wonky but totally works.
[4:49:03] <CynosZilla> Ivara is not very team friendly.
[4:49:03] <Murphio_GS> Thick thighs is why
[4:49:05] <+PowerArmorMeow> I raise her efficiency and duration and give her primed flow
[4:49:20] <OldOnyx> invis on 2, invis on kill with 3, invis on kill while in 2, ect
[4:49:25] <cowardlord> ye
[4:49:27] <Zombrocom> What ass?
[4:49:36] <%hellsquad2> Honestly the easiest way to play spy missions anyway is to be Limbo, since yaknow, Void invincibility
[4:49:58] <Sark_Eset> Shooting herself with her cloak arrow is usually the Ivara strat
[4:50:10] <Andele1503> She doesnt, but like most frames, playstyle is a massively important part in why someone likes a frame
[4:50:36] <OldOnyx> shooting her sentinal with invis arrow anyway
[4:50:49] <CynosZilla> Like her. But her gameplay is slow and methodical, and is not really what warframe is about today.
[4:50:55] <OldOnyx> and everybody will get that soon, yeah
[4:50:59] <VroomSoon> Do you have split flight on it?
[4:51:08] <$Valdorick> She clunk for that chunk
[4:51:33] <+PowerArmorMeow> I guess I just never found her clunky
[4:51:51] <+PowerArmorMeow> but I can understand what you're saying
[4:53:19] <Andele1503> Shall we talk about how valkyr rewards GOD DAMN COWARDICE with her signature ability? Now that, that is god damn actually bad design
[4:53:44] <$Valdorick> Sonic, you really move, Sonic, she's got that attitude
[4:53:56] <+PowerArmorMeow> @andele1503 cowardice?
[4:54:02] <$Valdorick> Sonic, she's the rollest thing ali~ive
[4:54:12] <CynosZilla> and invisible
[4:54:18] <+PowerArmorMeow> personally find Loki kinda boring....
[4:54:24] <YakumoYomi> Don't you shit on my baby Valkyr! I love ripping and tearing with her.
[4:54:30] <%hellsquad2> He's just heckin gone
[4:54:36] <$Valdorick> They should revamp Loki
[4:54:39] <$Valdorick> and shit on Wukong
[4:54:46] <CynosZilla> cameras dont get him, it is invisible enough for me. :v
[4:55:00] <%hellsquad2> Loki might actually become slightly better with Helminth system
[4:55:07] <%hellsquad2> but only slightly
[4:55:16] <Andele1503> @PowerArmorMeow Hysteria ramps its energy drain with time in hysteria instead of with time spent not killing/attacking, its damage store is easier to just run away in a corner to turn on and off instead of KEEP KILLING
[4:55:25] <CynosZilla> I use Loki a lot to open Lua Vaults :v
[4:55:31] <+Solutha> ash is pretty fun imo, just gotta spam smoke bomb more
[4:55:38] <+ziplockfriday> nyx is where its at
[4:55:48] <+SarcFa> and that's not even getting into the mess that is limbo
[4:55:49] <Andele1503> so yes, ill shit on ivara having shitty nerfed hysteria instead of Niers A2 berserk mode that tells you GO MURDER
[4:55:54] <Andele1503> valkyr*
[4:55:56] <$Valdorick> Wait, does Loki have digitigrade legs?
[4:56:01] <Andele1503> god damn plague now im saying ivara
[4:56:02] <%hellsquad2> To be a shittier Molt
[4:56:34] <@DCN2049> all of them suck in some way or another. Their ability systems are weird and can be too... quirky
[4:56:40] <+PowerArmorMeow> @andele1503 I think that has to deal with player skill in power management
[4:56:45] <YakumoYomi> Did Hysteria always work like that? I don't think I've played since before Eidolon was added to the game.
[4:56:49] <$Valdorick> Loki should steal weapons with his 4 and then give them to his Decoy - OOPS! They did that for the new frame.
[4:57:14] <+xeros720> he's supposed to be sneaky stabby right?
[4:57:38] <%hellsquad2> The Problem with Loki is that most of the abilities that would make him better were added into frames newer than him
[4:57:48] <$Valdorick> His 3 instantly needs to be useful beyond "I moved the defense target to the middle of this enemy pack, lawl"
[4:58:11] <Vexed_Algides> invisibility is in itself the second best survivabily available in the game rally
[4:58:11] <+PowerArmorMeow> he just disarms armed enemies
[4:58:48] <Andele1503> @PowerArmorMeow energy ramp to 7 energy a second with max efficiency for doing what you're supposed to be doing has nothing to do with resource management skills, it has to do with just bad design rewarding cowardice
[4:58:53] <%hellsquad2> See the way to make some of the abilities more useful would be to have his decoy be placed on an enemy that then gets targeted, but that ability was added to a different Frame
[4:58:59] <OldOnyx> If they weren't giving it away, decoy would actually be useful if it didn't die and was targetable by team mates
[4:59:14] <Vexed_Algides> yes, stray random million damage bullet will kill him, but he's got shield gating now, and there's quick thinking too
[4:59:22] <VroomSoon> Give him DR on invisibility :)
[4:59:24] <$Valdorick> Decoy should be invincable if its going to do no damage
[4:59:41] <$Valdorick> JUST LIKE MALLET (and that does damage!)
[4:59:42] <OldOnyx> Saryn isn't the only one that would like that but she'll have well of life so
[4:59:49] <+Solutha> clone jitsu
[4:59:58] <%hellsquad2> Or a massive increase in Crit chance on first shot out of invisibility
[4:59:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> I honestly dunno what to do to Loki's kit
[5:00:05] <Vexed_Algides> if he's to get DR, should be on exiting invisibility for a limited time
[5:00:13] <$Valdorick> Invincable and taunts enemies
[5:00:32] <Andele1503> @YakumoYomi Around second dream they nerfed her to ramp in energy cost with duration and only take damage she runs away like a bitch into a little room on the side, both parts of rewarding cowardice
[5:00:38] <+PowerArmorMeow> well explosive decoy?
[5:00:40] <+ziplockfriday> decoy duration base only maybe make affected enemy's crit damage multipler
[5:01:42] <Andele1503> Thats already kinda how it works if you place decoy into a location enemies cant reach...
[5:01:51] <Vexed_Algides> but if you're invisible, and you receive no damage, what's the point of it receiving the damage you take?
[5:02:43] <AzureFlame98> Decoy gives you stacking buff for something based on how much X damage its takes? or maybe it extends other abilities while its doing its job
[5:02:45] <$Valdorick> Invicable =/= invincable
[5:02:58] <+FadingEmber> maybe build the decoy into his invisibility?
[5:03:16] <%hellsquad2> Or make his decoy invincible with a much lower Duration where it explodes based on damage taken while out
[5:03:20] <+PowerArmorMeow> @plagueofgripes what about combining decoy and switch teleport?
[5:03:38] <CynosZilla> Just put his Decoy and Invisibility as one and the same skill. Like Zer0 from Borderlands.
[5:04:52] <%Rezca> decoy takes the damage
[5:05:13] <Sark_Eset> When you're visible it does damage, invis mitigates?
[5:05:32] <%JJCheeker> plagueGripes /
[5:05:39] <Vexed_Algides> why not add the DR to switch teleport?
[5:05:48] <+ziplockfriday> damage taken by decoy gives energy or health maybe oost crit damage
[5:05:49] <DougintheTrench> Maybe replacing yourself with an enemy makes more decoys? Or is that too much like mirage?
[5:05:50] <+Solutha> should leave a decoy
[5:05:51] <sec0nd_impact> switch with your decoy
[5:06:06] <Andele1503> Teleported enemy temporarily has your/lokis hp and shield values?
[5:06:21] <IcanConfuse> make it a normal teleport but if an enemy or decoy is targeted it does an aoe damage?
[5:06:22] <+SaintPyre> yes the mods are nice but the amoujnt of credits you have and the plat is like - crazy
[5:06:25] <+xeros720> how about just teleport?
[5:06:27] <psimon_> after you switch placss withthe enemy its accuracy is reduced by 40% for 8s
[5:06:29] <+Archphronimos> switch teleport with decoy?
[5:06:30] <+SaintPyre> i also may just be broke as hit
[5:06:36] <+PowerArmorMeow> you can use it on escort missions on plains of eidolon and that's the only thing I see use for it
[5:06:40] <AzureFlame98> Switch Teleport could help spawning more decoys and the whole thing is you just get an army of decoys with scaling benefits, I dunno.
[5:06:51] <cowardlord> Maybe become the enemy if you kill them with it?
[5:07:09] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Switch teleport puts a decoy on the enemy you switched with
[5:07:11] <+gerahwar> yea Ash rules of nature 4 ability
[5:07:15] <+PowerArmorMeow> bladestorm
[5:07:28] <+TallTimber> Get rid of it alltogether bring an ability that lets you disguise yourself as a targeted enemy
[5:08:11] <+PowerArmorMeow> I can see that working
[5:08:12] <+Archphronimos> each decoy present gives increasing buff?
[5:08:27] <+Archphronimos> or each decoy has an AOE debuff?
[5:08:38] <+xeros720> you can feel the age of his design
[5:08:46] <+PowerArmorMeow> Loki needs a damaging power
[5:09:33] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Mix Decoy with switch. When you switch with an enmy they look like you for a short period of time attracting friendly fire
[5:10:09] <+PowerArmorMeow> well if the enemies are disarmed they resort to melee. the decoys can explode upon being attacked?
[5:10:18] <AzureFlame98> Armor reduction based on number of clones along with clones casting radial disarm to extend its range so having more means larger coverage?
[5:10:37] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:10:42] <Vexed_Algides> thing with loki's current kit is that it's designed to divert enemy fire, or straight up negate it
[5:11:12] <OldOnyx> Teleport plants a grenade on the target that cause a radial blind and a aoe toxin tic and 4 hard stuns already disarmed or blinded enemies
[5:11:13] <$Valdorick> You steal their armor and shields for a while
[5:11:18] <+xeros720> yeah, that sounds good
[5:11:41] <Andele1503> Id rather have it "swap your and target stats" instead of merely armor strip
[5:11:43] <%hellsquad2> Switch Teleport forces Armor strip and Knockdown to allow Loki to Target High danger enemies
[5:11:52] <DougintheTrench> Loki taking your armored pants.
[5:11:53] <DianaTheAscian> what about stunning enemy's u switch teleport too?
[5:11:55] <+PowerArmorMeow> armor strips definitely nice
[5:12:00] <+xeros720> take their shit and use it against them sounds like a decent rebrand
[5:12:26] <+PowerArmorMeow> actually that's a good idea he steals the armor and applies that as damage mitigation
[5:12:34] <+xeros720> the playful, wacky trickster is that clown one
[5:12:47] <vazuryn> when u switch teleport u turn into the enemy that u switch with for a few seconds
[5:12:48] <DougintheTrench> Teleport switching Loki ties their shoe laces together.
[5:12:50] <%hellsquad2> Give him the ol bounce pads since Vauban doesnt have them anymore @PlagueOfGripes
[5:12:58] <+ziplockfriday> get a guaranteed drop from enemy ammo energy health from switched enemy
[5:13:00] <Vexed_Algides> @PlagueOfGripes Radial Disarm substitutes weapons for live grenades that explode.
[5:13:10] <+PowerArmorMeow> dear God no bounce pads
[5:13:10] <%hellsquad2> <-- Vauban Main
[5:13:13] <+xeros720> i was thinking of Mirage
[5:13:26] <%hellsquad2> Still Crying salty tears over Protea's existence
[5:13:39] <Sark_Eset> Hmm. Switch Teleport + Radial Disarm + new ability on a 3 piece swap?
[5:13:41] <+PowerArmorMeow> they replaced it with an accelerating boost pad
[5:13:50] <Sark_Eset> New ability to replace the slot opened by merge
[5:13:54] <+PowerArmorMeow> even more worse
[5:14:13] <Vexed_Algides> maybe switch teleport returns energy
[5:14:13] <$Valdorick> And Mariage already puts explosive into shit.
[5:14:19] <+xeros720> it was a TRICK SHOT
[5:14:26] <@Nightbot> @SaintPyre -> You done? [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[5:14:38] <@DCN2049> The bullet gave them cancer. They will die a slow death, five years from now
[5:14:39] <+Aeoneth> I always pictured debuffs as trickstery
[5:14:39] <Sark_Eset> Summon a giant flower that does gas damage?
[5:14:42] <+SaintPyre> oh the questionmark thing wasnt allowed, mb
[5:14:53] <@DCN2049> the SPAM isn't allowed
[5:15:23] <+SaintPyre> i assumed one message wasnt spam, but i see it wasnt - thats on me my bad
[5:15:29] <+doc_ock_rokc> stat stick it
[5:15:43] <+doc_ock_rokc> Decoy fires your equipted weapon
[5:16:35] <alextrebeken> returns enemy fire?
[5:16:40] <Andele1503> Lets go at this from the gameloop of players design point, Loki currently has 3 problems: Strength doesnt do anything, he has low efficiency against infested and being just the boomer stealth frame/doesnt have much if any gameloop depth other than "put decoy where enemy cant get to it, press 4"
[5:16:48] <%hellsquad2> Honestly what if they use that basically abandoned piece of the Ship system with the map, and he can kinda play "pranks" with switching security systems around on enemies or straight up sabotage causing areas to deal damage to enemies directly
[5:17:06] <CynosZilla> I think he shoul at least cast more than just one decoy at a time
[5:17:22] <arkv01> Plague, is your PC still rebooting without consent?
[5:17:33] <Vexed_Algides> what's loki's passive?
[5:17:57] <+SaintPyre> hasnt loki been just the "press 2 and become invis forever" frame? like yes it is single-track but also isnt his 2 one of the few 'literal stealth' thing in the game
[5:17:58] <Andele1503> He can wall latch for ages
[5:18:00] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Decoy can be plasced onto an enemy
[5:18:09] <%hellsquad2> Gains a stacking buff based on decoys out? @PlagueOfGripes
[5:18:13] <+PowerArmorMeow> agreed to that
[5:18:15] <%Rezca> so now he can party by himself
[5:18:20] <Vexed_Algides> ok, maybe his new passive is that he leaves a decoy after he uses an ability
[5:18:26] <%hellsquad2> Like 1=DR 2=damage buff 3=armor addition
[5:18:28] <$Valdorick> Yeah, its almsot like he needs a full rework, huh?
[5:18:31] <AnAnonymousGifter> An anonymous user gifted a Tier 1 sub to bettysharkface!  
[5:18:40] <Andele1503> So decoy spawns more decoys?
[5:18:43] <shioriou> each active decoy is 25% dr max 3 decoys
[5:18:47] <ZComiX> why not make it if you shoot a decoy you take damage?
[5:18:52] <OldOnyx> Well multiple Decoys and damage split does match his silver grove specter exactly
[5:18:52] <+ziplockfriday> build up a gauge to be used In other skills from decoy
[5:18:54] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes Harrow
[5:18:54] <Zombrocom> Nyx
[5:18:55] <@DCN2049> there are a few
[5:18:58] <+doc_ock_rokc> Nyx
[5:18:59] <%hellsquad2> Uh no there are a few that are more utility than anything
[5:19:04] <$Valdorick> Harrow does increased damage with his abilities though.
[5:19:08] <+PowerArmorMeow> replace his invisibility ability and just have switch teleport be the ability that let him turn invisible
[5:19:09] <Andele1503> Nyx and harrow have damage on 4 and 1
[5:19:20] <+PowerArmorMeow> he is the only 1
[5:19:23] <Vexed_Algides> even loki has damage, but he does so little of it
[5:19:30] <$Valdorick> Limbo psaSmug
[5:19:31] <Vexed_Algides> it's more like a fart
[5:19:33] <Andele1503> ah wait no harrow is just shield strength
[5:19:34] <+SaintPyre> im not familiar but does limbo have anything actually damaging
[5:19:36] <Zombrocom> Radial DIsarm technically does damage
[5:19:48] <CynosZilla> Nyx 4 absorbs and release the damage.
[5:19:54] <+PowerArmorMeow> she absorbs damage and sends it back
[5:19:56] <Zombrocom> Limbos 1 and 4 do damage, not much but damage
[5:19:59] <$Valdorick> Limbo does damage, but so little you might as well not.
[5:20:02] <shioriou> relic of older warframe
[5:20:04] <+ziplockfriday> damage gained from decoy can be expled in disarm to blow up their weapons
[5:20:21] <Andele1503> Disarm does damage against infested and melee enemies
[5:20:24] <Zombrocom> Against infested, it does. Technically.
[5:20:26] <+SaintPyre> i mean loki was initially a starter frame, and was prb ment to be one dimentional to be accessable to new players
[5:20:33] <Andele1503> aka enemies it doesnt do anything against otherwise
[5:20:36] <+SaintPyre> and in the sense of 'its for stealth' it makes sens e
[5:20:45] <+PowerArmorMeow> 500 impact damage
[5:20:50] <%hellsquad2> tbf Loki is one of the first warframes made for the game, so a rework wouldn't be out of the equation @PlagueOfGripes
[5:20:52] <Vexed_Algides> yep, a fart
[5:20:53] <$Valdorick> AMAZING
[5:21:05] <CynosZilla> hahaha
[5:21:07] <@DCN2049> the fart has confused them
[5:21:08] <Zombrocom> Wat
[5:21:10] <+PowerArmorMeow> it's just Loki slapping people's wrists
[5:21:27] <Vexed_Algides> that's an interesting bug
[5:21:31] <%Rezca> TRICKSTER
[5:21:32] <arkv01> that one just wants to go home
[5:21:46] <Zombrocom> This is amazing
[5:21:48] <+PowerArmorMeow> they're stuck on meleeing invisible loki
[5:21:51] <arkv01> they're getting closer ScaredyCat
[5:22:05] <$Valdorick> What's more Trickster than breaking the training room?
[5:22:09] <+xeros720> Loki forces everyone to dance, i see
[5:22:16] <YakumoYomi> They need a little room to breathe
[5:22:20] <arkv01> leaves one survivor to witness its comrades gone mad
[5:22:26] <+ziplockfriday> what a mysterious game
[5:22:31] <+PowerArmorMeow> hilarious
[5:22:33] <arkv01> waow
[5:22:34] <Zombrocom> SCIENCE
[5:22:44] <arkv01> maybe it's not a bug after all..
[5:22:55] <+PowerArmorMeow> that's Loki slapping sense out of them
[5:23:01] <Andele1503> Plague, try using a rapier for finishers
[5:23:04] <+ThomasOfTroy> Try it right next to them
[5:23:31] <Zooperton> does disarming the corpus walkers still cause them to grow stun sticks on their heads?
[5:23:33] <+BKNPham> but he's cool af
[5:23:50] <Vexed_Algides> no, but now they're stuck on that idle
[5:23:54] <psimon_> you need to be in melee range i think
[5:23:55] <arkv01> dance if you want to
[5:24:12] <Zombrocom> WAT
[5:24:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> ai is borked
[5:24:14] <DianaTheAscian> waoTHINK
[5:24:16] <+doc_ock_rokc> DE is being DE
[5:24:17] <Murphio_GS> HahaElf
[5:24:31] <arkv01> that's a lot of new features LUL
[5:24:40] <+PowerArmorMeow> Loki is so forgotten that this has happened
[5:24:45] <+Solutha> turning on melee ais
[5:24:49] <Andele1503> yup, it changes their AI from whatever weapon they were using to the butcher/prova ai
[5:25:08] <psimon_> thats his ability Kappa
[5:25:11] <Shwepie> Warframe AI vs One Gripey boy
[5:25:26] <Andele1503> And you know what they say, its terrible when players go "what the hell is wrong with the ai?"
[5:26:18] <Andele1503> well his 1 and 4 do
[5:26:36] <+PowerArmorMeow> garbagio to the nth degree
[5:26:38] <shioriou> so that they doint go after defense obective
[5:26:42] <$Valdorick> You can swap places with your decoy, but then BULLETS ARE GOING TOWARD YOU
[5:26:56] <+doc_ock_rokc> you can actually bypass a ton of stuff with decoy switching
[5:27:05] <+Zeuvin> @PlagueOfGripes what primary weapons would you recommend for a MR12 player?
[5:27:17] <Andele1503> tho theoretically his 1 and 4 ALSO have anti-synergy if you place it too well because melee ai actually understands pathing/walls unlike ranged ai
[5:27:20] <$Rivalshotzgp> Remember when swap was useful due to ai protection missions, gotta need him
[5:27:37] <+tussletoes> Zhuge!
[5:27:37] <%hellsquad2> lol the tubegun of doom
[5:27:38] <shioriou> mr 4
[5:28:06] <Treuan> Once you get a Hek you sto pgiving one
[5:28:21] <+tussletoes> Bowguns are an acquired taste.
[5:28:30] <+PowerArmorMeow> it's just repeating crossbow
[5:28:37] <Zombrocom> MR 12? That's when you unlock syndicate weapons. Use those. Waykor hek, Rakta cernos, synoid simular
[5:28:41] <Zombrocom> Those stuff
[5:28:44] <+serpenttucker> Do you think Nidus can parasitic link a decoy?
[5:28:47] <+doc_ock_rokc> I just want The Decoy to not PERMINANTLY LEVEL 1
[5:29:04] <splicerss> Plague how do I get into Warframe
[5:29:11] <splicerss> I don’t know what to do
[5:29:15] <+doc_ock_rokc> yeah they patched that out
[5:29:18] <+ziplockfriday> make the decoys massive
[5:29:18] <Zombrocom> You also get sybaris prime at MR12
[5:29:19] <sec0nd_impact> what if decoys explode and stun when you switch
[5:29:30] <Andele1503> @Zeuvin Vaykor Hek, Stahlta, Rubico Prime, Phantasma, Corinth, Prisma Grakata and Ignis Wraith, ofc also all of the kuva weapons
[5:29:38] <arkv01> getting huge for oneself
[5:29:40] <+serpenttucker> @splicerss complete the galaxy map. You will find your objective eventually
[5:29:40] <+doc_ock_rokc> @splicerss download game -> Try to complete starchart
[5:29:42] <+tussletoes> "How do you get into--" just go. Go.
[5:29:53] <%hellsquad2> I'm looking forward to Necramechs @PlagueOfGripes
[5:30:07] <splicerss> I have the same issue with Destiny 2 lol
[5:30:12] <Zombrocom> I am ready for necramechs to be underwhelming and forgotten about in a month
[5:30:18] <+Zeuvin> Thank you @Zombrocom and thank you @Andele1503 :)
[5:30:22] <splicerss> I don’t know what I’m supposed to do other than strikes
[5:30:24] <+TallTimber> I want excaliber prime :trollface:
[5:30:33] <+PowerArmorMeow> I really wish they would fix loki
[5:30:43] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah ignis wraith. That thing is easy to get and super strong
[5:30:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:30:57] <izaich> There is Irradiating Disarm, which is fun.
[5:31:02] <Andele1503> Infested used to literally be dismembered by Radial Disarm which made them hop on the ground in a very funny way
[5:31:11] <+PowerArmorMeow> it doesn't work on infested
[5:31:23] <+FadingEmber> So I just spent 15 minutes trying to solo a Grendel survival and I think I'm going to just farm the plat instead
[5:31:33] <$Valdorick> They'll shoot eachother for 4 whole seconds!
[5:31:35] <Shwepie> That's Radiation status, not damage.
[5:31:37] <+serpenttucker> Warframes should not be fixed by augs. They should be reworked.
[5:31:39] <+doc_ock_rokc> @PlagueOfGripes it makes them attack eachother
[5:31:41] <izaich> It's an automatic radiation proc, isn't it? They basically go crazy on each other.
[5:31:44] <Andele1503> Irradiating disarm iirc isnt even radiation status, but confusion like nyx
[5:31:50] <terminusterminal> Oof. I just joined in the middle of this and I'm super lost. Damnit, I play Warframe too.
[5:32:07] <$Valdorick> They'll be doing enemy to player damage numbers to eachother! So like... 200 damage to their 30K hp pools!
[5:32:10] <Andele1503> so its "useful" if you wanna sac a mod to get a extra condition overload stack
[5:32:11] <+PowerArmorMeow> @izaich augment
[5:32:17] <+serpenttucker> Maybe you can put the decoy in a empty part of the map? with savior decoy?
[5:32:27] <splicerss> Plague, thoughts on precum?
[5:32:29] <izaich> @PowerArmorMeow yep, that's what i was talking bout
[5:32:35] <$Valdorick> THEY will be invunl!?
[5:32:42] <$Valdorick> Why not YOU! The player!?
[5:32:51] <CynosZilla> People use it in sorties to protect the VIP on defense missions
[5:32:52] <+Solutha> make them invulnerable so you can die in their place LUL
[5:32:54] <arkv01> sow confusion in your own ranks to win the war
[5:32:55] <AzureFlame98> It also nullifies ancient auras because they are hostile to each other but you could just use any radiation AoE to get the same effect
[5:32:56] <CynosZilla> but it is too niche
[5:33:09] <Shwepie> Switch teleport Decoy so it is invincible forever and draws all aggro?
[5:33:10] <+serpenttucker> Does the invulnerability stack? If you had two loki's switching places with safeguard?
[5:33:16] <Andele1503> its 13~ish seconds with regular loki invis build
[5:33:26] <Andele1503> and yes the invul stacks and can be refreshed
[5:33:38] <+PowerArmorMeow> it's mostly to save someone
[5:33:51] <%hellsquad2> At that point why not make an augment for his invisibility that Makes anyone close enough to Loki invisible for the same duration @PlagueOfGripes
[5:33:59] <izaich> Personally I'd rather not get yoinked altogether, regardless of any buffs I'd get.
[5:34:05] <Andele1503> it would be 16 seconds with your current build
[5:34:24] <+doc_ock_rokc> Do Zepher next
[5:35:24] <+PowerArmorMeow> and now you understand why I hate Loki and hear the "Loki master race " meme
[5:35:26] <CynosZilla> It could work as nezha 2, prime the enemies to recieve more damage
[5:35:48] <+ziplockfriday> it needs synergies with his other skills
[5:35:48] <Andele1503> I know its derpy, but id love radial disarm to make you give their ammo to your party
[5:35:53] <Vexed_Algides> I mean, we already spend energy as a resource
[5:36:06] <+FadingEmber> Very troll ability
[5:36:23] <splicerss> I wish that Defiance 2050 wasn’t dead and boring
[5:36:23] <+serpenttucker> Switch teleport and the decoy don't work in a game where you are either jumping past all enemies, or deleting entire rooms one shot at a time.
[5:36:30] <splicerss> It has a lot of stuff I liked
[5:37:01] <+PowerArmorMeow> but what can the 3 be
[5:37:10] <CynosZilla> It could be just a teleport to anywhere he wants, no targets needed. Even then it wouldn't be that great
[5:37:18] <+serpenttucker> Was decoy ever invulnerable?
[5:37:19] <%criticalinked> criticalinked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 14 month streak! how's it going Plague? Twitch finally gave me a notification you were streaming for the first time in...a year.
[5:37:28] <GarbageNirvana> Is this stream on loop
[5:38:09] <+PowerArmorMeow> agreed
[5:38:13] <Andele1503> With duration or like ivara?
[5:40:02] <%hellsquad2> Chaos/Subterfuge? While invisible Gain increased Damage reduction while out of Stealth gain increased Critical change and Damage
[5:40:14] <+PowerArmorMeow> could have the decoy follow Loki's movements while invisible
[5:40:57] <%hellsquad2> I mean the Decoy Shouldn't follow Loki, because then its useless as a decoy
[5:41:03] <+PowerArmorMeow> sounds good to me
[5:41:25] <+PowerArmorMeow> well not follow Loki I mean mimic his movements
[5:42:07] <%bettysharkface> Holy smokes Plague, this is still going? I hope you've eaten some food
[5:42:21] <+serpenttucker> Maybe teleported enemy explodes for a certain amount of strength damage?
[5:42:29] <Andele1503> A booby trap/corpse explosion?
[5:42:34] <+PowerArmorMeow> @bettysharkface it's cuz Loki is that bad kit wise
[5:42:35] <GarbageNirvana> Why can't Loki shapeshift and fuck animals to give birth to new combat pets is the real question
[5:42:36] <+serpenttucker> Or Loki explodes?
[5:42:40] <%bettysharkface> Please eat like, a cracker or something
[5:42:54] <Andele1503> so when you teleport to someone (or decoy) so that it explodes based on damage taken like vauban 1 augment?
[5:43:13] <+doc_ock_rokc> Switch teleport person looks like loki while your disgised as the person you switched with and take 500% more friendly fire damage
[5:43:40] <+PowerArmorMeow> the Loki conundrum
[5:44:05] <+serpenttucker> With how little health the decoy has, it wouldn't be for very much
[5:44:42] <+ziplockfriday> too convoluted
[5:45:03] <+PowerArmorMeow> why not increase duration of the invisibility @plagueofgripes
[5:45:07] <+serpenttucker> Maybe decoy, switch teleport, and radial disarm all apply to a buff that gets cashed in with invis? Multiple stats gaining benefits?
[5:46:18] <+TallTimber> "What is my purpose?" "To fall forever in the void"
[5:46:40] <+PowerArmorMeow> rather than having to recast invisibility you can feed time to make it stay on longer
[5:47:30] <Vexed_Algides> switch teleport gives DR, Radial Disarm removes armor and ancient auras. Radial Disarm can shoot from your decoy. Decoy uses your weapons.
[5:48:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> yeah , just looking for that loop
[5:49:03] <Zombrocom> Athodai is just a better knell
[5:49:23] <+ziplockfriday> switch tele gives more health or damage to decoy
[5:50:02] <+serpenttucker> "Trickster aura"
[5:50:08] <%hellsquad2> Give loki a mayhem counter
[5:50:28] <Vexed_Algides> yeah such a good passive
[5:50:32] <RevenTheLight> Ha, I forgot too
[5:51:02] <Andele1503> DONT, wall latch loki is actually a legit option with some meme arcanes
[5:51:10] <+PowerArmorMeow> garbagio passive
[5:51:10] <+tussletoes> Jesus you can still see the cobwebs gathering up on that passive.
[5:51:10] <Andele1503> thats already nyx passive
[5:51:32] <Vexed_Algides> nyx reduces enemy accuracy
[5:52:01] <Andele1503> Ah, wait do you mean it then in the rakta dark dagger effect?
[5:52:25] <Vexed_Algides> what does "see" mean in the context of a game mechanic?
[5:52:31] <+PowerArmorMeow> nyx is a just an Excalibur barbie
[5:52:45] <Vexed_Algides> oh ok, so he's like translucent?
[5:52:47] <Andele1503> where enemy aggro cant happen for 5m more
[5:52:51] <OldOnyx> Oh, God, give him Planetside style stalker cloak as a passive. Less visable the slower you go. Kappa
[5:53:17] <OldOnyx> Ivara but actually bat actually infuriating
[5:53:21] <Andele1503> because usually enemies aggro from 38m to 15m depending on type and level with rakta dark dagger reducing it by 5m
[5:53:53] <OldOnyx> I swear I english gud
[5:53:59] <larrycapijja0> Ey Ey
[5:54:02] <larrycapijja0> The Game
[5:54:05] <$Rivalshotzgp> Just make it effect all npc’s again
[5:54:13] <+PowerArmorMeow> Loki is already pretty fast
[5:54:22] <DougintheTrench> Oh god I just hit my first cap on the FF14 free trial and it's a gathering class. My highest combat class is level 17. Send help.
[5:55:18] <+serpenttucker> Maybe his passive is to build "Confusion" which makes his abilities more effective based on abilities used? Decoy and switch teleport builds to it. Invis drains it, and radial disarm uses the entire stack, with higher stacks dealing damage.
[5:56:56] <Andele1503> Talk more about korone and botan
[5:56:59] <+PowerArmorMeow> it's just a mess
[5:57:07] <+TallTimber> Ash was what DE wanted when the made loki. :trollface:
[5:57:15] <psimon_> I don't even play the game and I like this
[5:57:43] <+PowerArmorMeow> Loki needs an overhaul
[5:59:03] <ZComiX> Night duderino
[5:59:05] <YakumoYomi> I enjoyed your 6 hour Warframe developer diary
