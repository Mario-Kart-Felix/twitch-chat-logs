[0:00:02] <WornyTheHun> The internet is bad out there. Probably some jackalopes chew the cables. Or something like that.
[0:00:10] <%octotasty> plagueWave @kaoseart
[0:00:17] <kaoseart> the link above
[0:00:19] <+KiwiRedgrave> yay
[0:00:24] <%octotasty> oh, I just saw it
[0:00:26] <%octotasty> ÑP
[0:00:28] <%octotasty> :P
[0:00:31] <PlebianNoob> We back
[0:00:32] <kaoseart> yes
[0:00:36] <%NKOrange> oop we back plagueTaps
[0:00:36] <Coystick> It's him!
[0:00:40] <%KellBeII> eyyy
[0:00:44] <%Heart0fInk> HE BAK!!
[0:00:55] <kaoseart> wb plague cat
[0:00:57] <Lusifee_> he's bacc
[0:01:19] <%Heart0fInk> So. The eldritch knowledge of Vtubers...?
[0:01:23] <Samex_Comex> I guess if was a vtuber my model would look like a beat'em up/fighting game character
[0:01:24] <%octotasty> A slime V-Tuber with a rig like that? might work
[0:01:35] <%octotasty> 3D or 2D?
[0:01:36] <HeroSolaire> Do you have any picture of your  pc/drawing setup, Plague?
[0:01:52] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Yay it is once again time for the internet goblins to attack plague’s computer
[0:02:00] <kaoseart> 2D
[0:02:09] <kaoseart> Mainly
[0:02:29] <kaoseart> I think It could work thanks to how simple the shape
[0:02:35] <Samex_Comex> Pet the modem call it a good boy
[0:02:39] <HeroSolaire> I always stuggle to get properly comfy using pc and drawing just wondering what a more experience artist like you draws at
[0:02:58] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> @plagueofgripes so we now get to experience you in powerpoint form yes?
[0:03:10] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> I enjoy powerpoint of gripes
[0:03:17] <%octotasty> @kaoseart it shouldn't be too hard to rig, the main challenge to make it look life like would be to add some jiggle to sell how ooze like they are
[0:03:39] <kaoseart> Indeed
[0:03:45] <kaoseart> Would be interesting to try
[0:03:52] <kaoseart> I could make different versions
[0:03:54] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> This looks wonderful
[0:03:59] <kaoseart> Slime girl with deep black man voice
[0:04:00] <kaoseart> lol
[0:04:16] <emptyantics> Your personal favourite artist?
[0:04:16] <TheAntiNihilist> Remake Our philosophy seems to be: MORE instruments means MORE emotions and BETTERER quality
[0:04:25] <+thereisneverenoughdakka> Large slime man with incredibly high pitched voice @kaoseart
[0:04:36] <kaoseart> Maybe
[0:04:39] <kaoseart> Not sure
[0:05:02] <Samex_Comex> Jelly Jiggler
[0:05:08] <kaoseart> @kaoseart But Yea Not sure how to make jiggle and ooze sounds
[0:05:13] <kaoseart> Maybe a voice filter
[0:05:16] <marklarphd> Imagine an RPG character who intermittently drops out of your party due to internet connection issues
[0:05:29] <kaoseart> That be great lol
[0:05:36] <HeroSolaire> Any advice to going from Photoshop to Clip Studio Paint? im preparing to make the transition lol
[0:05:55] <%octotasty> all modern V-Tuber software includes a form of Boob Jiggle. You can probably hack a way to make it Ooze jiggle
[0:05:58] <kaoseart> Sofar sounds good to me plague
[0:06:29] <HeroSolaire> Lower the resolution to 720p or 540p
[0:06:30] <%KellBeII> we can still hear you though
[0:06:30] <%octotasty> is that cat man ref posted somewhere?
