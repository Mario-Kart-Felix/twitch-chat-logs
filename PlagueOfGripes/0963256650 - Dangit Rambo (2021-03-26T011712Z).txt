[0:22:57] <@PeachSaliva> true
[0:23:05] <%impulse255dj> thank you @PeachSaliva
[0:23:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:23:08] <footloosepariah> I can’t believe Plague is playing Dangan Nabbit.
[0:23:12] <footloosepariah> Why?
[0:23:13] <NetherTable> we gotta put that gun on TRIAL
[0:23:13] <doublemasteramerica> Can't have crimes of passion in your mystery game. Who was the murderer? A man who simply got on two different busses and fled town within the hour
[0:23:32] <+reiface08> you gotta make murder fun eli
[0:23:49] <+Promessa_EX> don't forget to drop a yellow gummy bear
[0:23:51] <Restainly> hey sexy where u been all my life
[0:23:59] <$sleepy_coffee> But what if the projectile was fired from the rectum of the assailant instead of a gun?
[0:24:01] <Restainly> sorry wrong chat
[0:24:03] <zk_nails> Plague, this is very similar to something that happens in the 3rd game
[0:24:15] <NetherTable> that's a great impression
[0:24:29] <boatzndhoez> what the hell
[0:24:39] <Daxalog> Storm hit
[0:24:42] <%Arancet> nagito is the interfering asshole role of 2, like byakuya in 1 but even worse
[0:24:52] <CrispinColes> storm go bbrrrrrrrrr
[0:24:52] <cap_bon> So your saying the perfect murder would be just knocking on some ones door and saying "Garbage day" before shooting them
[0:24:53] <boatzndhoez> is this...like a new playthrough, I'm so confused
[0:25:01] <%Arancet> at least the interfering asshole in 3 is fun
[0:25:01] <Deadbulky> H o p e
[0:25:03] <+vanareus> stand on one, hit them with the other
[0:25:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> hopeman
[0:25:15] <Lord_Vance> @arancet true
[0:25:18] <+shaidot> @Arancet also super gay
[0:25:26] <+sumrand0> Caught upon the VOD just in time to  catch this live woo-hoo!
[0:25:28] <laserbeaming> He wants to be Tzeench
[0:25:34] <Jjaz_R> Nagito is fuckin annoying
[0:25:34] <laserbeaming> but falls short
[0:25:35] <franctastic_> yeah Nagito is super popular
[0:25:43] <%Arancet> @Arancet also yesa
[0:25:46] <Slice_of_Delicious_Life> It is weird how popular he is yeah
[0:25:57] <+sumrand0> he's the vanilla flavor
[0:25:59] <+YabbaTroll> he is a misunderstood uwu soft boi
[0:26:01] <zk_nails> just break his legs
[0:26:06] <+reiface08> i thought byakuya was the wrench thrower
[0:26:07] <franctastic_> I like Nagito, I used to not like him
[0:26:14] <Lord_Vance> I blame the kanye west meme
[0:26:19] <ehStuGatz> shining justice girl has some nice hips
[0:26:20] <+Fnir> isn't he like a f-up version of the protag of the first game ?
[0:26:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> Monokuma
[0:26:24] <Deadbulky> Gundham
[0:26:24] <+shaidot> tetsuya nomura
[0:26:24] <CalderGaming> that's their secondary Ultimate ability that they all share
[0:26:25] <glass_marcus> they just wake up and it's like that
[0:26:26] <+Promessa_EX> monomi
[0:26:41] <+JailShmixRemix> A plague stream at a resonible time? Impossible
[0:26:45] <arkv01> they've got hair goop to keep the shape intact
[0:26:45] <$sleepy_coffee> He probably gets swirlies
[0:26:45] <CrispinColes> princess wifey
[0:26:48] <%Arancet> @Fnir when i first started playing this is thought he WAS the portag of 1 for a minute
[0:26:48] <+sumrand0> Japanese teens IRL & in anime + games
[0:26:51] <+shaidot> she's totally into it
[0:27:11] <Lord_Vance> oh yeah this is chapter 3, the curse lives on.
[0:27:17] <+Mekhet09> Wait I missed this. Ibuki and hiyoko are dead?
[0:27:22] <+JailShmixRemix> She does succeed at being cute though
[0:27:24] <+YabbaTroll> ye
[0:27:30] <CrimsonFox777> Weeb Princess
[0:27:45] <+Rolandknight> What are you talking about? Their hair has always been that way since brith!
[0:27:47] <vladtet909> "X doesn't really need to exist" can be applied to a lot of Dangan Ronpa characters
[0:27:52] <+sumrand0> lol yup 0 personality she's the "acceptable outsider"
[0:27:56] <+Promessa_EX> every love live foreigner
[0:28:02] <ehStuGatz> but what if she's a dirty half breed like that girl from tokyo mirage sessions
[0:28:02] <CrispinColes> based nurse
[0:28:06] <franctastic_> @Fnir i thought this was a direct sequel, seeing chubby byakuya made me play these games
[0:28:26] <ralphwiggum16> Can I just say Zelda/Plague is confusing me in ways I'm not used to.
[0:28:56] <+sumrand0> @ralphwiggum16 its a confusing bone to be sure
[0:29:15] <wolfen091> the only thing missing is ds9 and paige squealing

[0:35:58] <+reiface08> that sounds too stupid to be true
[0:35:59] <%Arancet> i think Duck Tape is the brand, duct tape is the type of tape
[0:36:01] <laserbeaming> 🦆
[0:36:07] <CrispinColes> duck is a brand of duct tape
[0:36:08] <vladtet909> I thought Duck tape was a brand
[0:36:12] <Sapphire_Breeze> John Duck
[0:36:29] <arkv01> BibleThump
[0:36:31] <karakurikudos> duct tape is actually very shitty unless your using it for air ducts
[0:36:33] <+shaidot> WWII invention
[0:36:35] <Lord_Vance> duck tape is a brand yeah, has a cartoon duck on it.
[0:36:39] <ehStuGatz> you have it backwards plague

[0:37:01] <laserbeaming> she was also flattened
[0:37:01] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah, obi is meant to be tied in the back. The only people who tie in the front are prostitutes.
[0:37:08] <+reiface08> she looks like wallpaper plastered to the pillar in that shot
[0:37:30] <+sumrand0> Prostitutes you say?
[0:37:36] <ehStuGatz> titty typhoon is a good name for a bar
[0:37:43] <karakurikudos> 😳
[0:37:55] <+sumrand0> I'll need to confirm this before I believe it myself
[0:38:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> seeing hanged people can make you panic a little bit
[0:38:04] <zk_nails> he walked there and back
[0:38:29] <Deadbulky> Slice n dice
[0:38:41] <+sumrand0> fake body?
[0:39:01] <Lord_Vance> how much does she weigh? propping up a body cannot be easy.
[0:39:11] <karakurikudos> mmmmm, mac n cheese
[0:39:14] <%Arancet> cant we tie him up again?
[0:39:16] <thechodericky> I forgot how odd the art can look on this series

[0:39:40] <+sumrand0> he would like face farts
[0:39:53] <wolfen091> @lord_vance you've obviously never been duct taped to a wall
[0:39:57] <+sumrand0> thats y he has brown eyes
[0:39:58] <CrimsonFox777> @Lord_Vance Wiki lists her at 31kg/68lbs
[0:39:59] <Daxalog> The body is still warm

[0:41:18] <franctastic_> I kind love how Chiaki is just standing  there
[0:41:18] <+mostdumbname> You could probably fit Pat inside the 12-foot tall Home Depot skeleton and put a giant suit on it
[0:41:19] <Zyzx_> finally, dangan
[0:41:19] <+Promessa_EX> !dassault rafale

[0:43:18] <wolfen091> !nutmuffin
[0:43:21] <CrispinColes> bannanaNUT
[0:43:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:43:36] <+sumrand0> use your teeth so you don't leave fingerprints!
[0:43:44] <%Arancet> no ones letting him do it
[0:43:45] <CrimsonFox777> A guy searching a girl's dead body would be seen as a massive creep.
[0:43:56] <cap_bon> Becuase it would be creepy if he did it
[0:43:58] <CrimsonFox777> But then again, he kind of already is one so...
[0:44:05] <arkv01> shes the sheriff of the titty typhoon
[0:44:22] <Arancet> did plague declare his predictions for this case yet?
[0:45:07] <CrispinColes> @arkv01 titty sheriff, this shirt ain't big enough for the 2 of us
[0:45:11] <thechodericky> Will the people playing jazz please quiet down, some children are tryin to investigate
[0:45:13] <CrimsonFox777> I never thought about it, but do any of them have pajamas or are they all just stuck in the one set of clothes?
[0:45:51] <karakurikudos> i imagine they only have the one set with identical backups.
[0:46:02] <+sumrand0> I feel like Paige: confused and anxious about being confused.... and that's making me more anxious and thus more confused....
[0:46:06] <%Arancet> @CrimsonFox777 its anime, their clothes are part of their bodies, at least until its time for swimsuits
[0:46:10] <Jjaz_R> BLOOD OCEAN
[0:46:16] <sosuke5> Hajime has a bit of an imagination
[0:46:18] <+Promessa_EX> it'd be weird if someone was scared of blood
[0:46:43] <laserbeaming> hot pink blood
[0:46:47] <+hirohideki> scottfThinkle
[0:47:03] <+hirohideki> scottfOhno
[0:47:06] <karakurikudos> she was killed from the left?
[0:47:16] <CrispinColes> back, and to the left
[0:47:50] <+sumrand0> better theory than anything I've got
[0:48:16] <laserbeaming> it's for the ambiance
[0:48:23] <karakurikudos> it's to set the mood
[0:48:41] <thechodericky> Wait I missed the beginning of the stream who got murdered?
[0:48:47] <wolfen091> hemp bag... man that ain't no dime bag
[0:48:56] <CrimsonFox777> @thechodericky Ibuki and Hiyoko
[0:48:56] <sosuke5> Ibuki and Hiyoko

[0:49:01] <crunchycat_6> Hiyoko and Ibuki
[0:49:40] <Deadbulky> Big clue
[0:49:43] <wolfen091> sprinkles!
[0:49:46] <thechodericky> Oh...if only it was nagato maybe soon
[0:49:46] <+sumrand0> IDK y but I keep anticipating a random OBJECTION!
[0:49:47] <karakurikudos> FEET
[0:49:49] <arkv01> FEET?!
[0:49:53] <arkv01> D:
[0:49:59] <+sumrand0> No Phoenix here
[0:50:05] <+Tr1pkT12> ITS BLUD
[0:50:07] <arkv01> SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF ah yeah she's definitely dead
[0:50:13] <B1ak3N1k05999> Bluuuud

[0:50:51] <+derg0ns> blood on the souls of my infant
[0:51:16] <+Promessa_EX> well unless you do it right
[0:51:18] <+sumrand0> "Soul of the blood of the wolf"
[0:51:44] <OzeanSusceptor> I feel like Dangan tries to get away w/ Ace Attorney's convolutedness, which only barely works because cases are disconnected. Here, new and random objects will be introduced and only relevant to the case at hand which can feel unnatural cause it's a continuous story
[0:51:59] <CrimsonFox777> Doesn't the rope break the neck when the ladder is kicked out?
[0:52:15] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, have you ever been in a room with that many dead bodies?
[0:52:20] <+sumrand0> @crimsonfox777 not always even when its done right
[0:52:23] <thechodericky> Plus ace attorney has a lot more goofy charm to it
[0:52:25] <vladtet909> You need a very specific vertebrae to break for instant death to occur
[0:52:41] <LunarRemix> Yay Drunkenronpa!
[0:52:42] <terminusterminal> "only two"
[0:53:15] <%Arancet> why is the termostat 9 feet up?
[0:53:27] <karakurikudos> it's more like tightening a ziptie around your throat using your weight than Instantly snapping your neck.
[0:54:04] <+sumrand0> Based on perspective that thermostat is like more than 1'x1' lol
[0:55:01] <+sumrand0> shaddup and show me your hamsters YAYYYY
[0:55:14] <CalderGaming> is "Jum-P" a Zero Escape reference?
[0:55:22] <B1ak3N1k05999> I love him
[0:55:27] <%Arancet> chu UU UU
[0:55:28] <CrimsonFox777> Gundham is best boy

[0:58:03] <+sumrand0> "natural glue"

[0:58:38] <CrimsonFox777> It really is a "super" market
[0:58:41] <@PeachSaliva> eli no
[0:58:43] <+sumrand0> SUPERMARKET
[0:58:44] <Arancet> its a murder supply supermarket
[0:58:46] <sosuke5> understood
[0:58:48] <wolfen091> eli yes
[0:58:51] <+Promessa_EX> what if it works tho
[0:58:51] <+Rofiarf> that doesn't seem fun
[0:58:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> but it's cool
[0:58:55] <CrimsonFox777> Got it, do the big murder simply
[0:59:00] <+sumrand0> Nike: gunna kill?
[0:59:00] <+vanareus> good advice eli
[0:59:03] <$Rezca> Liquid Cyanide

[0:59:15] <cap_bon> Just shoot them and dont get seen
[0:59:16] <karakurikudos> k.i.s.s. keep it simple stoopid
[0:59:25] <wolfen091> contact poisons, very easy
[0:59:34] <+sumrand0> Randomized victims make motives impossible to determine!
[0:59:39] <CrimsonFox777> Plague hides all the bodies on his farm
[0:59:49] <laserbeaming> does monokuma require the murder to be convoluted?
[1:00:10] <+sumrand0> lol goddammit chat this is incriminating as shit hahaha
[1:00:19] <+sumrand0> AND DIED
[1:00:25] <$Rezca> sometimes you just want to get it Just before death

[1:01:55] <hamahiroyuki> wait WHAT?!
[1:01:59] <CrimsonFox777> @hamahiroyuki Does Plague still want to keep her in a handbag to bark at passerby though?
[1:02:01] <+sumrand0> she was a voice of reason
[1:02:10] <wolfen091> there's a clear difference in the hanged man and the hung man
[1:02:15] <+Promessa_EX> that's a damn lie nagitooo
[1:02:17] <$Rezca> Hanging Rope?
[1:02:18] <hamahiroyuki> fucking hiyoko!?

[1:03:54] <wolfen091> @sumrand0 nah, one is a bar in a game I'm drawing a blank on right now and the other is a gay bar on 31st and elm
[1:03:55] <%Arancet> @hamahiroyuki hates him, hes annoying

[1:04:28] <hamahiroyuki> @arancet SeemsGood ok, good im not crazy
[1:04:34] <Phob05> She should be covered in blood
[1:04:55] <hamahiroyuki> nagito always says how

[1:08:35] <Jjaz_R> I really hope Nagito dies.
[1:08:44] <+sumrand0> liver temperature decreases at very specific rate
[1:08:55] <+sumrand0> Used for TOD
[1:08:55] <+Mekhet09> It depends on if you have the tools.
[1:09:01] <%Arancet> i mean, i dont know dead bodies, but its a common problem with freezing foods
[1:09:25] <+sumrand0> @arancet meat is meat
[1:09:43] <Deadbulky> yes
[1:11:15] <Sapphire_Breeze> so you can theoretically kill everyone
[1:11:18] <%mikesapartment> you could not kill more than two
[1:11:28] <+AllamiNotSalami> yo its the gripe dude
[1:11:38] <+jorgamund> "kill them all, Plague!"
[1:13:05] <karakurikudos> isn't it like with multiple blackened it's whoever killed first?
[1:13:20] <+sumrand0> Common japanese writing problem: logic/laws are often unable to make sense when given more than a SINGLE thought.
[1:13:31] <themagic_conch> it takes 3 people to discover the body for the trial to start I think
[1:14:01] <+Promessa_EX> we gotta number one victory royale
[1:14:18] <+Heart0fInk> Plague Don't you know anything about the Japanese games? They're Fucking Stoopid..
[1:14:19] <warmnoid> dangan royale
[1:14:39] <Deadbulky> SUS
[1:14:44] <karakurikudos> gundam gonna wipe out tomato town
[1:14:58] <Artista_AF> yeah... that's why i feel Murder should have been a banned crime from this kill-game
[1:15:09] <+sumrand0> if 4 people kill 2 people yeah the games unfinished
[1:15:30] <zk_nails> update the rules I guess
[1:15:32] <+sumrand0> unfinishable
[1:16:24] <$Charlie99993> I'm the second killer
[1:16:51] <+sumrand0> I feel like hearing these ridiculous rules would've made me kill myself to avoid this logic mess
[1:16:52] <Carnadan> don't booli the bear
[1:16:56] <B1ak3N1k05999> Shut up
[1:17:17] <CalderGaming> "shut up though" - the writer
[1:17:19] <terminusterminal> Fucking rise up Chiaki
[1:17:19] <karakurikudos> the game's being made as you play it.
[1:17:20] <+jorgamund> I don't mean to cast aspersons on Mr Bear here, but I'm starting to think he's just making it up on the fly
[1:17:21] <SuperVaderMan> Gamer brain
[1:17:31] <+sumrand0> GAYMER BRAYNZ
[1:17:31] <$Bigchill___> Gamer Cave, GAMERS
[1:17:45] <Deadbulky> I bet that save smells of salt and despair
[1:17:53] <Carnadan> Gamer brains real thicc yeah
[1:18:07] <Phob05> That Movie, starring That Man
[1:18:09] <+sumrand0> 1.5 mill
[1:18:21] <+sumrand0> still a good deal tho
[1:18:34] <CrimsonFox777> Imagine paying $1.5M to not watch a movie.
[1:18:45] <%Arancet> sounds worth it for batman v superman
[1:18:49] <CalderGaming> yes she does
[1:18:55] <CalderGaming> wait what
[1:18:56] <Deadbulky> And suplex
[1:18:57] <+sumrand0> living body pillow
[1:18:59] <SuperVaderMan> very Yeetable
[1:19:03] <Jjaz_R> "huggable"
[1:19:05] <kingra> Toss the gamer
[1:19:06] <TurtleButter> Pomf?
[1:19:08] <CrimsonFox777> She seems like a comfy person
[1:19:09] <vonmaultke> Rugby throw
[1:19:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> pomf
[1:19:16] <@PeachSaliva> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:19:22] <+Promessa_EX> she just wants to play games with you
[1:19:23] <zk_nails> throw her on the rocks
[1:19:26] <+sumrand0> YES
[1:19:27] <%Arancet> ...no, but now im thinking about it
[1:19:31] <+dumemoto> Sprained ankles, every day
[1:19:36] <Sapphire_Breeze> and soft walls like in a mental ward
[1:19:38] <+sumrand0> ALL THE TIME
[1:19:38] <CalderGaming> there was a place like that at toon town in disneyland iirc
[1:19:38] <$Rezca> Not too often
[1:19:39] <SuperVaderMan> Literal Bouncy House
[1:19:45] <Artista_AF> yes, & yeah it would be annoying
[1:19:49] <B1ak3N1k05999> Maybe
[1:19:51] <%SirFancySwank> never be able to carry a drink
[1:19:53] <$Bigchill___> Just have hammocks
[1:20:01] <Artista_AF> ok the one room would be cool
[1:20:02] <+jorgamund> what if the trampoline was raised slightly in the middle, so that all the furniture gravitated towards the walls
[1:20:05] <LVL1_Scumbag> I'm good with floors
[1:20:17] <+sumrand0> Eli reading my mind
[1:20:18] <%SirFancySwank> trophy wife
[1:20:20] <%Arancet> shes not the brains around here
[1:20:37] <CrimsonFox777> No, but I've thought of a room that has nothing but dakimakuras piled everywhere. Does that count?
[1:20:38] <SuperVaderMan> just standing around, being strong and thinking about food. Literally a saiyan
[1:20:38] <B1ak3N1k05999> Love her Akane
[1:20:51] <Steezles> murder her so she can do a cute scream
[1:20:54] <+sumrand0> hey gurl u got a cute scream.....
[1:21:01] <Deadbulky> For science
[1:21:02] <+Heart0fInk> "She has a cute scream" Plague ~2021
[1:21:17] <B1ak3N1k05999> Danganronpa 2 has the best waifus
[1:21:17] <Phob05> I feel like Mikan is secretly a super murderer
[1:21:21] <+jorgamund> "squeal for me!" - Some farmer out in Kentucky, 2021
[1:21:45] <B1ak3N1k05999> and good guy characters. Except for the main one
[1:21:51] <zk_nails> God, I forgot the name of that place...

[1:24:17] <Steezles> Mahiru was really a vampire
[1:24:26] <+sumrand0> bug or clue hmmmmm
[1:24:41] <+sumrand0> POINTING!
[1:24:48] <%Arancet> more like everyone else got more insufferable

[1:26:03] <+sumrand0> pretty good sticker actually lol
[1:26:13] <+Heart0fInk> 5 Yen
[1:26:20] <CalderGaming> 150 million
[1:26:34] <vladtet909> Usually you just add two 00's to anything Yen related
[1:26:35] <+Promessa_EX> movie poster for a great game back there
[1:26:46] <%Arancet> apparently that sticker came with the collector's edition lol
[1:27:10] <+Heart0fInk> How do you defeat the bear?
[1:27:12] <+sumrand0> or C u die the no worries!
[1:27:24] <+sumrand0> then
[1:27:38] <fridayfuntime> oscar worthy movie incoming
[1:27:39] <+Heart0fInk> Like... do you gotta fist fight the bear?
[1:27:43] <+Promessa_EX> sigh alibi
[1:28:03] <+sumrand0> you know THE REASON
[1:28:11] <%Arancet> i assume its a translation foible.... i hope
[1:28:22] <@Nightbot> @karakurikudos -> Beep! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:28:24] <LunarRemix> I've seen people say it's a translation issue too
[1:28:35] <+sumrand0> not EVERYTHING  can be lost in translation
[1:28:46] <LunarRemix> Like they have a very specific word "That" actually has meaning besides just that
[1:28:58] <LunarRemix> Like it's half saying what that is
[1:29:05] <fridayfuntime> what
[1:29:10] <SuperVaderMan> ???
[1:29:16] <Phob05> I feel like your character is going to be framed for muder because they're the only one to see the video and the first to the crimescene and that ticket exists just for that
[1:30:02] <+sumrand0> yayyyyy no nagito
[1:30:11] <CrimsonFox777> "Naughty Bear"
[1:30:19] <+Promessa_EX> well yeah your ticket is evidence you couldn't be the copycat
[1:30:36] <+sumrand0> you canNOT reDo
[1:30:37] <%Arancet> "oh no, a school shooting?!"
[1:30:44] <%Arancet> how could THAT happen
[1:30:48] <LunarRemix> Even if shit happens on YOUR own schools you don't seem to mind very much
[1:31:08] <karakurikudos> school shooting causing mass panic >_>
[1:31:29] <+sumrand0> so Japan?
[1:31:31] <+Mekhet09> All you have to say is that this is because of liberals and half the nation will riot.
[1:31:52] <CalderGaming> eli are you monokuma? you have to tell us or it's entrapment
[1:31:56] <+sumrand0> lol nice
[1:32:25] <+xerioes> oh man that screen efffect is irritating
[1:32:30] <fridayfuntime> oscar worthy
[1:32:34] <SwagetronPrime> lol
[1:32:42] <Sapphire_Breeze> what a hero
[1:32:49] <arkv01> fair
[1:33:25] <fridayfuntime> this is just an rpg where the player is a psychopath
[1:34:02] <vilecrois> the standard D&D murderhobo group I guess
[1:34:05] <CrimsonFox777> A cinematic masterpiece!
[1:34:13] <LunarRemix> This must be like super funny for japanese folk
[1:34:17] <SwagetronPrime> now that's subverting expectations!
[1:34:18] <fridayfuntime> give this bear an oscar
[1:34:20] <LunarRemix> Comedy gold
[1:34:20] <Deadbulky> Based on a true story - direct by neil drukman
[1:34:26] <+jorgamund> did Man Of Steel rip off this plot?
[1:34:36] <%Arancet> not enough sads for neil
[1:34:37] <fridayfuntime> gpmBog gpmBog
[1:34:40] <karakurikudos> 6/10 needed more 3d
[1:34:48] <fridayfuntime> that line
[1:34:52] <TurtleButter> Imagine they watched that movie and no one decided to imitate it.
[1:34:56] <fridayfuntime> LUL LUL
[1:35:07] <Steezles> isn't it a real game?
[1:35:19] <CrimsonFox777> Cause they're a hack
[1:35:44] <%gnollAUS> Such a uninspired movie to imitate
[1:36:02] <wolfen091> justice
[1:36:18] <%SirFancySwank> chapter 3's murder was super dumb
[1:36:21] <vilecrois> cough souls cough
[1:36:27] <Phob05> Yeah Hyoko probably was killed first
[1:36:33] <$Rezca> Its like poetry, it has to rhyme
[1:36:55] <terminusterminal> Oh yeah Hiyoko was shot by arrows
[1:37:05] <terminusterminal> Oh wait no she wasn't
[1:37:07] <%gnollAUS> But no arrows
[1:37:08] <karakurikudos> she was shot?
[1:37:10] <$Rezca> Nailed to a tree
[1:37:10] <Phob05> uh
[1:37:11] <+Rofiarf> lion was tied to a tree
[1:37:12] <%gnollAUS> How does that work
[1:37:13] <+jorgamund> but the lion was pinned to the tree by arrows, where are the arrows?
[1:37:20] <%Arancet> hiyoko couldve been killed first, but iirc she wasnt taped up on the pole until after you see ibukis body the 2nd time
[1:37:23] <karakurikudos> tied to a tree/pole maybe?
[1:37:24] <CrimsonFox777> She's still pinned to a tree/pillar
[1:37:26] <+Heart0fInk> Tin
[1:37:41] <+Mekhet09> Pinned to a tree.
[1:37:48] <Jjaz_R> This seems like "because of reasons" the game.
[1:37:54] <SuperVaderMan> What if the imitator's just really bad at imitating
[1:38:24] <LunarRemix> The ultimate bad imitator
[1:38:34] <Phob05> Then who didnt have a heart?
[1:39:05] <fridayfuntime> hey why are you Zelda
[1:39:29] <wolfen091> the motel hotel
[1:39:43] <+sumrand0> well good luck Eli hope you ride out the storm alright
[1:40:13] <+Mekhet09> lol
[1:40:20] <fridayfuntime> damn right
[1:40:45] <%Void_The_Dark> motel
[1:40:47] <fridayfuntime> motel are small
[1:40:48] <CrimsonFox777> Yes
[1:40:49] <CalderGaming> holiday inn
[1:40:49] <+Mekhet09> motels are shit.
[1:40:52] <glass_marcus> it's a holiday inn
[1:41:33] <+Heart0fInk> seeping shit
[1:41:35] <+sumrand0> smelly
[1:41:36] <%Arancet> how does a rabbit doll/robot shit?\
[1:41:41] <+jorgamund> oh God why
[1:42:18] <karakurikudos> fecal funny
[1:42:47] <$Bigchill___> he ugly?
[1:43:10] <arkv01> please understand a needless convolution for western audiences is a brain tickle for the japanese consumer
[1:43:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:45:03] <+jorgamund> maybe they only killed the IDEA of Hiyoko
[1:45:16] <Sapphire_Breeze> sus account
[1:45:18] <Phob05> The real backdrop was hiding her body
[1:45:27] <%KgKid51> LUL LUL
[1:45:28] <+senoue> Does he have baby hands too?
[1:45:29] <+Heart0fInk> LOL He Does!
[1:45:30] <Jjaz_R> With this game's logic the murderer could literally be anyone.
[1:45:35] <%Arancet> hes already tiny
[1:45:44] <+senoue> Holiday inn
[1:45:44] <$Bigchill___> or hes a dummy of himself with a tv of himself in another location talking to you
[1:45:48] <+kujofire990> HOLIDAY INN
[1:45:49] <+jorgamund> it's "motel" using Waffle House signage
[1:45:51] <arkv01> MOTEL but actually licensed hotel :)
[1:46:02] <terminusterminal> Is the name of this place Vacancy?
[1:46:08] <+Heart0fInk> Call it the Don't Tell Motel.
[1:46:28] <%Arancet> he sent hamsters in to report?]
[1:46:31] <arkv01> he assumes pants pissing will become much more frequent from now on
[1:46:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> he sensed the dark aura
[1:47:01] <%Void_The_Dark> Did she follow you in?
[1:47:05] <CalderGaming> brooch
[1:47:09] <CalderGaming> too high detail
[1:47:09] <CaptHat211> Isn't that the doll from Bloodborne?
[1:47:23] <%KgKid51> @ehstugatz ty for the gift sub bro plagueChirei
[1:47:28] <terminusterminal> Wanna explain yourself there sony
[1:47:30] <CrimsonFox777> You hear that? A confession!
[1:47:48] <Janzer_> drangleic hambone
[1:48:45] <karakurikudos> a black mirror or readings?
[1:49:06] <+Heart0fInk> Ok
[1:49:11] <+Heart0fInk> Hang
[1:49:13] <+Heart0fInk> on
[1:49:41] <+Heart0fInk> WTF Is with the Japanese with "Despair" shit?
[1:49:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> zetsubou
[1:49:54] <+Heart0fInk> why is that in fucking everything?
[1:49:59] <karakurikudos> it's a very neat word.
[1:50:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> it gives them boners
[1:50:05] <%Arancet> dont forget JUSTICE
[1:50:23] <karakurikudos> or FRIENDSHIP
[1:51:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> fart sniffing?
[1:51:08] <$Bigchill___> You see, the fly only exist to feed the spider
[1:51:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> "ah yes, love is chemicals in our brain"
[1:51:12] <$Bigchill___> and the spider is my ego
[1:51:13] <LunarRemix> I think it has less to do with it being japanese and more just bad media in general
[1:51:25] <+Promessa_EX> despair is a literal phenomenon in this game universe. it just makes you dissociate and murder people
[1:51:52] <CrimsonFox777> She'd appreciate being larger than she is.
[1:52:04] <chidory000> like pontificating?
[1:52:08] <Samex_Comex> I'm awake
[1:52:47] <franctastic_> BibleThump
[1:52:55] <karakurikudos> untill it was revealed to be the disease
[1:53:05] <Phob05> Her name is Sonia Nevermind?
[1:53:09] <%Arancet> ...didnt hiyoko never wear a sash before this game?
[1:53:20] <terminusterminal> She said: "cope"
[1:53:38] <karakurikudos> ^
[1:53:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> :(
[1:54:17] <Phob05> Or let her use YOUR mirror
[1:54:18] <CrimsonFox777> You don't need to call me out like that, Sonia.
[1:54:18] <CalderGaming> i mean she did say she wanted to do it herself
[1:54:22] <$Charlie99993> She mentioned she didn't want help though
[1:54:22] <xeros720> "Hiyoko remembered that."
[1:54:29] <KELTHUZAD9999> but is in her nature to be a shitty person
[1:54:52] <+Mekhet09> She was an accessory to a murder.
[1:55:15] <+zepelinnn1> but she wanted to do it by herself
[1:55:15] <+Mekhet09> Hiding evidence makes you an accomplice plague.
[1:55:22] <Sapphire_Breeze> murder is more acceptable than being loud in Japan
[1:55:50] <arkv01> murder quietly
[1:56:11] <Jjaz_R> But, how did this bitch get in the locked room?
[1:56:25] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[1:56:34] <Phob05> Oh, Manley cut his own stomach which might be the blood on the floor in the titty typhoon
[1:56:39] <+zepelinnn1> she got in as you unlocked the door, the game does not make it very clear
[1:56:55] <sosuke5> she followed you in
[1:56:56] <Captain0Punz> She walked in after you
[1:57:06] <Sapphire_Breeze> she walked in with you?
[1:57:10] <SuperVaderMan> came up out of the toilet
[1:57:13] <Phob05> Manlet*
[1:57:15] <+Promessa_EX> she probably was meant to follow you, but it's fun if we say she vented
[1:57:24] <xeros720> everyone is just wandering around is how i felt when I played this
[1:58:22] <Jjaz_R> This dumb bullshit is rated "Overwhelmingly Positive" on Steam, BTW.
[1:58:22] <LunarRemix> Because he's a man?
[2:00:03] <Phob05> yeah thats what I figured
[2:00:41] <+Promessa_EX> may explain the black curtain
[2:00:51] <%Arancet> shes tiny next to that step ladder
[2:00:54] <Waypastfuture> so how has plague enjoyed DR2 so far?
[2:01:39] <+Promessa_EX> there's also two bags
[2:01:45] <$Charlie99993> @Arancet It's a PSP game, pls understand
[2:01:54] <sosuke5> Enjoyment is a tenuous way of putting it
[2:02:32] <xeros720> i thought the reason was Monokuma was the only one in control of the cameras so he can watch the murders and conduct the trials
[2:02:33] <LunarRemix> It looks like her arm is super tiny
[2:02:35] <CrimsonFox777> Didn't Soda say that they can't record?
[2:02:56] <%gnollAUS> foreshortening is not happening
[2:03:07] <Samex_Comex> Stop in the name of love
[2:03:24] <vonmaultke> the top and outside edge of the palm are both flat
[2:04:02] <+Heart0fInk> Hmmmmm Still closed...
[2:05:08] <%Arancet> soda has such a nothing personality, i think thats supposed to be the point to contrast his design, but hes dull
[2:05:39] <Phob05> Boy there sure are a lot of "No that cant be it because of this."
[2:07:00] <Samex_Comex> He taped clothes hanger to it
[2:07:01] <$Charlie99993> Talents are JUST super powers
[2:07:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> maybe he replaced the antenna
[2:07:21] <+Promessa_EX> he taped d batteryies to the antennas
[2:07:32] <+Promessa_EX> supercharge
[2:08:54] <xeros720> the tl;dr : camera M goes to tv M; camera H goes to tv H; there are no other tvs or cameras
[2:09:07] <Waypastfuture> yeah p much
[2:09:14] <%Void_The_Dark> You got it
[2:09:28] <CrimsonFox777> DO IT
[2:09:28] <LunarRemix> ALRIGHT YES
[2:09:29] <arkv01> yes honey ;(
[2:09:33] <LunarRemix> JUST SAY YES
[2:09:33] <+zepelinnn1> NWF
[2:09:35] <+ThomasOfTroy> I'm done
[2:09:42] <$Bigchill___> Hajime, why!?
[2:09:44] <hamahiroyuki> ok, I know why I hate hiyoko so much. I dont see her as just as a little abrasive, I see her as verbal abuser but it doesnt stick because most of ppl dont give a fuck about her.
[2:09:46] <+zepelinnn1> no way Jose
[2:09:46] <Phob05> Wow
[2:09:49] <+arcielardor> so is the kid dead yet?
[2:09:53] <Phob05> Fuck this MC
[2:09:53] <Samex_Comex> Akane never found out about your harem
[2:10:28] <terminusterminal> So this is obviously a clue
[2:10:57] <Jjaz_R> Hell yeah
[2:11:14] <+Heart0fInk> She doesn't bathe
[2:11:16] <$Charlie99993> She's a caveman
[2:11:19] <arkv01> oh god the smell
[2:11:21] <arkv01> SNIFFFFF
[2:11:21] <%Arancet> smelly waifu
[2:12:04] <vladtet909> Was
[2:12:44] <arkv01> hiyoko was a spicy one :(
[2:12:51] <+zepelinnn1> fuck those machinnes
[2:12:56] <+Heart0fInk> MRI and washing machine
[2:12:56] <+zepelinnn1> they are loud as fuck
[2:12:56] <CalderGaming> basically yes
[2:13:06] <CalderGaming> those things use helium but not like that
[2:13:09] <terminusterminal> I turned on her after she started insulting fuyuhiko and pekoyama in the middle of the stupidest murder of all times
[2:13:09] <arkv01> MRIs are pretty loud but kinda comfy
[2:13:16] <+arcielardor> It is natural to have small abrasive children
[2:13:21] <+arcielardor> hate
[2:13:27] <+arcielardor> not have
[2:13:34] <Jjaz_R> Being abrasive is better than being a murderer.
[2:13:43] <%theloganbrand> Love the Zelda Plague
[2:14:06] <%Arancet> at times it felt like she was frustrated at being one of the only sane people surrounded by crazies
[2:14:15] <%theloganbrand> Shinji did the unsspeakable here
[2:14:34] <xeros720> in commemoration of the fanservice, there is now a plaque detailing the event
[2:14:49] <CalderGaming> she was supremely unlikeable to me which made me not care about her death at all
[2:14:54] <%Arancet> i cant tell if its better or worse than spyro
[2:15:03] <arkv01> bad dragon plague was rocking it pretty good

[2:16:26] <MauroUnit1> 4 raiders from MauroUnit1 have joined! 
[2:16:31] <CalderGaming> distracted
[2:16:31] <AtomGenerator> RAID
[2:16:32] <MauroUnit1> I was drawing a Goku on stream and remembered you are basically a Dragon Ball channel now (? so i'm raiding, just for the meme mostly since it's only 4 viewers
[2:16:35] <+Promessa_EX> she's adorable it hurts
[2:16:35] <Samex_Comex> When she says "hey hey" I keep thinking of Krusty
[2:16:35] <+arcielardor> languid?
[2:16:38] <%Void_The_Dark> It looks like the curtain goes all the way across. Looks like a rail
[2:16:52] <CalderGaming> @arcielardor that too
[2:17:11] <Phob05> then how was it pitch black in the roo-aw fuck it
[2:18:34] <xeros720> light abolishing curtains, please use responsibly
[2:18:35] <%Arancet> theyre VERY good blackout curtains
[2:18:41] <LunarRemix> Not american curtains but japanese curtains would
[2:18:49] <xeros720> they are pretty much a d&d item
[2:18:54] <Phob05> Vanta Blackout curtains
[2:18:58] <blerrger19> Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2:19:11] <+Promessa_EX> the curtain was folded 1000 times
[2:19:14] <$Bigchill___> When is it a proper time to be a coward?
[2:19:18] <%mikesapartment> blood soaked fabrics
[2:19:30] <+Doemoe34> superior Nippon fabric folded over a thousand times
[2:19:45] <%Arancet> cant shit if you dont feed it
[2:19:49] <+Promessa_EX> it only shits when you get your steps in
[2:19:53] <Futurecity10> Holy shit why do you run like a cryptid
[2:19:58] <hamahiroyuki> yeah, even as someone with all japanese blood I wasnt taking any of that samurai shit thing between peko and fuyuhiko. maybe because I was also raised in brazil, the last country to abolish slavery.
[2:20:41] <LunarRemix> Oh boy
[2:20:44] <LunarRemix> 3K dying per day
[2:20:51] <arkv01> jesas
[2:20:54] <arkv01> whats going on in brazil?
[2:21:00] <LunarRemix> Death is going on, that's what.
[2:21:05] <arkv01> no masks?
[2:21:09] <LunarRemix> Well
[2:21:09] <%Arancet> theyre big on denial
[2:21:14] <LunarRemix> The president being what the president is
[2:21:29] <+Promessa_EX> none of this would have happened if all the celebrities just came to brazil like they asked
[2:21:32] <hamahiroyuki> we're getting petty 1st world problem while still being a 3rd world shithole
[2:21:38] <LunarRemix> Some people wear masks but of course it only takes a few dipshits to spread it around
[2:22:55] <hamahiroyuki> like, american twitter bullshit petty problems i say
[2:23:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:23:15] <%Arancet> and what if nekumaru is the killer?
[2:23:33] <LunarRemix> They smelled his shit and decided to commit suicide lol
[2:23:49] <%mikesapartment> it is in fact the most votes
[2:24:10] <LunarRemix> You'd think it's like Among Us
[2:24:13] <PleasantLeech> it's basically just among us
[2:24:23] <LunarRemix> If you know people know you are the killer, might as well vote for yourself
[2:24:24] <CrimsonFox777> amogus
[2:24:26] <+Promessa_EX> they keep debating
[2:24:35] <ducellion> sus amogus
[2:25:17] <Samex_Comex> Pig barf
[2:25:18] <%mikesapartment> pig barf
[2:25:32] <arkv01> she bullied her because she cared :(
[2:25:33] <$Bigchill___> she wasn't a toilet clogging bitch tho
[2:25:57] <hamahiroyuki> but I'll the current president isn't being as awful as I thought. no angry mob storming the congress. yet. Also sorry for blabbering about. I actually already know this game's storry.
[2:25:57] <PleasantLeech> it's her own fault for being so easy to bully
[2:27:07] <CursedNobleman> whos plagues suspect?
[2:27:10] <SeValentine> artist logic 101
[2:27:17] <Sapphire_Breeze> attempts to create depth?
[2:27:18] <arkv01> esoteric 2d aesthetic thing I guess
[2:27:22] <PleasantLeech> it's for style
[2:27:23] <+Spacemarine501> art lighting
[2:27:31] <SeValentine> NotLikeThis AMOGUS
[2:27:47] <+Pixel_Matt> monkaS AMOGUS
[2:27:53] <thealsian> Is he going crazy?
[2:28:01] <CursedNobleman> clever answer LUL
[2:28:03] <blerrger19> Maybe for indoors when their backs are to a wall?
[2:28:04] <Futurecity10> ah shit, is the gremlin dead?
[2:28:11] <SeValentine> everyone suspect, excluding the besto waifu
[2:28:19] <CursedNobleman> ibuki and hiyoko died @Futurecity10
[2:28:29] <CursedNobleman> cool voice tho
[2:28:40] <+doctor_piranha> Gundam is my favorite though
[2:28:47] <%mikesapartment> a robot???
[2:28:55] <ducellion> lmao
[2:29:03] <+Pixel_Matt> MrDestructoid
[2:29:09] <CursedNobleman> as long as neko can eat and shit, 'sall good
[2:29:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> roooar
[2:29:16] <CalderGaming> it's like a shitty royal rainbow
[2:29:20] <PleasantLeech> it's kinda like how mgs2 is kind of a repeat of mgs1 while still being technically different
[2:29:57] <%Arancet> but i want byakuya to be dead
[2:30:08] <Samex_Comex> Time to get revenge for Ibuki
[2:30:28] <hamahiroyuki> one last shit about this hellhole country of mine: it's all have been downhill ever since we kicked out the king. Sorry for blabbering.
[2:31:02] <LunarRemix> A couple hundred years ago yes. Same thing with Portugal.
[2:31:22] <CalderGaming> the colostomizer 5000
[2:31:32] <Samex_Comex> He's all robot but his anus
[2:31:42] <hamahiroyuki> the more you know brazil story the more embarrassing portugal looks
[2:31:48] <CursedNobleman> fun times LUL
[2:32:09] <LunarRemix> Not to say it's you guy's fault but our current president is basically Trump 2.0
[2:32:09] <CalderGaming> i can't believe music is dead forever
[2:32:16] <CursedNobleman> remember the time we became the worlds economic powerhouse by having everyone bombed back to kingdom come? LUL
[2:32:19] <+arcielardor> oh good
[2:32:29] <SeValentine> KaWutGuys not the musician grill
[2:32:45] <PleasantLeech> amongus!
[2:32:46] <+Pixel_Matt> monkaS AMOGUS
[2:32:48] <+Mossinoda> amogus
[2:32:49] <+doctor_piranha> amogus
[2:32:49] <Futurecity10> SHUT UP
[2:32:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> AMOGUS
[2:32:51] <Samex_Comex> It was the chef!
[2:32:58] <CursedNobleman> amogus LUL
[2:33:05] <+Spacemarine501> red dead
[2:33:14] <ducellion> GET OUT OF MY HEAD
[2:33:14] <wolfen091> remember the time our country was well thought of around the world?  I dont
[2:33:47] <thealsian> This is a long ass freaking trial so be prepared.
[2:33:51] <CursedNobleman> weather?
[2:33:54] <+Heart0fInk> 11:50PM over here
[2:33:56] <%Arancet> i like this track
[2:33:56] <SeValentine> the world may end up like this game, if this virus doesn't go away this year
[2:33:57] <xeros720> 10 minutes to monster hunter time
[2:34:05] <PleasantLeech> i'm guessing you have satellite internet
[2:34:14] <LunarRemix> So more Danganronpa for us?
[2:34:20] <CrimsonFox777> Trial time?
[2:34:31] <terminusterminal> Might still be a good idea to stop here anyways if this trial is as long as people say
[2:34:40] <CursedNobleman> oh right, im in cali, not... anywhere else in america with actual weather
[2:34:53] <%Arancet> silly meteorologists, cant predict the future at all
[2:34:57] <SuperVaderMan> Damn, my house isn't going to get destroyed by a tornado, now I have to play more danganronpa
[2:35:18] <SeValentine> 4Head drive
[2:35:37] <CursedNobleman> they really dont matter, though i like concentration or whatever
[2:35:53] <%Arancet> the important thing is you still have her panties
[2:36:04] <xeros720> they only really serve to make the minigames less bs
[2:36:12] <CursedNobleman> ... its fine that my girl died. i still have her panties? DansGame
[2:36:16] <SeValentine> but most of this stuff doesn't get fully unlocked on a single game attempt run. at least on a 2nd or 3rd run
[2:36:17] <%Arancet> there is a mid point break at least
[2:36:22] <xeros720> yeah, pretty much half of any chapter is the trial
[2:36:37] <Samex_Comex> Don't clean them
[2:36:48] <xeros720> i befriended Nekomaru first
[2:36:56] <xeros720> totally worth it
[2:36:59] <+Mekhet09> did you get his boxers?
[2:37:00] <Lan_Ran> Don't worry you're wearing them so no one will notice
[2:37:00] <+Spacemarine501> important mechanic
[2:37:16] <xeros720> Nekomaru is actually a briefs guy
[2:37:30] <arvym2> I really liked your video on Dangan Ronpa 1. For as much as I enjoyed playing the series, you had some good criticisms. Do you have any favorites in this game, so far?
[2:37:32] <+Pixel_Matt> D:
[2:37:45] <CursedNobleman> plagues wife LUL
[2:37:54] <LunarRemix> Good
[2:38:01] <%Arancet> wow, buttons couldnt handle that powerr
[2:38:12] <+Promessa_EX> that's a good hajime face too
[2:38:21] <+Spacemarine501> shirt way too tight
[2:39:29] <Samex_Comex> Hajime why do you have all our underwear pinned to your wall?
[2:39:47] <SeValentine> Hands down among us got inspired on this game KEKW
[2:40:00] <LunarRemix> Hajime why did we give you our underwear?
[2:40:36] <karakurikudos> but WHO was hanging?
[2:41:04] <+Spacemarine501> hajime you are the only one we can trust with the underwear
[2:41:47] <CursedNobleman> this is considered the weakest trial of DG2 aint it?
[2:41:48] <CrimsonFox777> But if that wasn't Ibuki on the video feed, then who was phone?
[2:41:58] <+Mekhet09> uh.
[2:43:18] <+FackinCrazy> Mikan is a proctologist
[2:43:25] <Lan_Ran> Fuyuhiko
[2:44:01] <SeValentine> Its sus
[2:44:09] <Sapphire_Breeze> sus
[2:44:26] <Lan_Ran> amogus
[2:44:33] <Waypastfuture> question is english komaeda voiced by shinji like japanese kommaeda is?
[2:44:35] <+Spacemarine501> very sus
[2:44:37] <ducellion> sus
[2:44:46] <LunarRemix> No but I would never lie!
[2:44:48] <Phob05> but then wheres the drama
[2:45:33] <SeValentine> No shoot 4Head
[2:45:41] <+LordSDB> Man this is a song I'd play DDR to woolieCHAN
[2:45:50] <vladtet909> At least the music is good during the trialss
[2:45:57] <+Promessa_EX> vita controls were nice
[2:46:21] <CrimsonFox777> Oh yeah, that one. My friend had some strong opinions on that one.
[2:46:53] <+Promessa_EX> nagito is throwing you a softball as a buddy
[2:47:04] <Phob05> gettin this one out of the way early
[2:47:08] <CursedNobleman> friggin mechanic is such a dumbass LUL
[2:48:10] <+Mekhet09> I wish there was a game where you were the mastermind and your job was to make a convoluted as fuck plot.
[2:48:46] <Jjaz_R> Goddamn, I hope Nagito dies. He's such a chode.
[2:48:52] <$Charlie99993> Don't movie tickets usually have dates?
[2:49:02] <xeros720> and times, yeah
[2:49:12] <xeros720> i think they were tailored per person in this scenario though
[2:49:14] <Lan_Ran> Seems like you could add extra complications with the tickets
[2:50:08] <+Promessa_EX> it's shinji's voice
[2:50:09] <SeValentine> ohhh the 4th wall breaking references aciddoUWU
[2:50:23] <Waypastfuture> yeah japanese is more softboy
[2:50:27] <Lan_Ran> Nagito sounds like a very pensive breathy Shinji Ikari
[2:50:37] <arkv01> I want to give nagito a vacation in the toilet bowl
[2:50:40] <Samex_Comex> I'll be your stepladder Akane
[2:50:43] <+zepelinnn1> they are almost 2 different characters in their delivery
[2:51:04] <CursedNobleman> @Samex_Comex shes like 6ft tall and mostly muscle, your frail nerd spine would snap LUL
[2:51:11] <%SirFancySwank> the VA for nagito is same as Makoto from danganronpa 1 in both english and japanese
[2:52:48] <SeValentine> sonia's voice its too damn clean
[2:52:59] <aflyingsh0e> danganronpa is bad with this
[2:53:12] <aflyingsh0e> "there's a hammer with red liquid on it... ok now lets find the murder weapon"
[2:53:21] <+LooglePlatinum> what Eli you actually play the danganronpa?
[2:53:45] <+LooglePlatinum> oh i saw
[2:54:07] <+LooglePlatinum> but didn't cross my mind you playing it now!
[2:54:36] <+LooglePlatinum> of course for "I am Monkuma"
[2:55:31] <+Spacemarine501> all cases need more globs
[2:55:41] <terminusterminal> What's got her smiling so much?
[2:55:57] <SeValentine> She's always MOTIVATED.
[2:56:07] <SeValentine> Like *always* aciddoUWU
[2:56:40] <+Promessa_EX> on vita you could just smush the rear touchpad like a dummy
[2:56:46] <%Arancet> look at my globs!
[2:56:52] <%heartlesshealer> oh no, Ibuki's dead before fuyuhiko
[2:56:56] <+LooglePlatinum> lol fun times psvita
[2:57:00] <Waypastfuture> hey aren't slimegirls semitransparent globs?
[2:57:10] <+LooglePlatinum> glue
[2:57:18] <xeros720> rubber cement is probably the better answer
[2:57:28] <CrimsonFox777> "It wasn't rubber at all. That semitransparent glob was probably rubber."
[2:57:51] <xeros720> wish we could actually look at all the stuff in the stores on the island
[2:57:58] <jellssssss20> I feel like common sense might suggest glue, but it’s a weird jump when it’s glowing green
[2:58:01] <+Who_lio42> no such thing as pink blood
[2:58:03] <%heartlesshealer> chiaki no
[2:58:05] <LunarRemix> ...What if it was semen
[2:58:06] <+Spacemarine501> only in Japan
[2:58:10] <+zepelinnn1> Chiaki eats glue confirmed
[2:58:20] <+LooglePlatinum> indeed lol
[2:58:21] <CursedNobleman> there is green glue, lookitup on amazon
[2:58:36] <Samex_Comex> Mmm glue
[2:58:48] <SeValentine> why green glue must exist marthSip
[2:58:48] <%heartlesshealer> green glue is more real than censor-magenta blood
[2:58:59] <+LooglePlatinum> Mikan my favorite character
[2:59:08] <+arcielardor> it was the gamer girl. it was her gamer gunk that acted like glue
[2:59:14] <CursedNobleman> @SeValentine its called locktite, you use it on applications you want to know when the glue breaks
[2:59:44] <%mikesapartment> i just want to hotglue chiaki
[3:00:06] <CursedNobleman> @mikesapartment she plays videogames, so she meets your high standards LUL
[3:00:07] <SeValentine> Ohhhhh marthPOG
[3:00:14] <+LooglePlatinum> we all fall for traps
[3:00:25] <SeValentine> alright that actually makes sense marthLUL thanks Nobleman
[3:00:29] <terminusterminal> Kill everyone
[3:00:31] <%heartlesshealer> monomi no
[3:00:37] <CrimsonFox777> That's not how it works Monomi
[3:00:37] <terminusterminal> Like a wild animal strike wildly at your surroundings
[3:00:39] <%Arancet> just ignore the diaper bunny
[3:00:41] <jellssssss20> Oh Impmon Fuyuhiko
[3:00:56] <+Who_lio42> there should be a button to just shoot monomi everytime she speaks
[3:00:57] <CursedNobleman> @SeValentine there was a huniepop meme about that; people picked the gamer girl... just because she played video games
[3:01:57] <Samex_Comex> Maybe it was in the dark?
[3:02:00] <SeValentine> damn (X marthSip
[3:02:23] <jellssssss20> Which magic power does Hajime have? Hope?
[3:02:26] <+Who_lio42> I think you could count on hajime to run and get help above anything else
[3:02:33] <+LooglePlatinum> Gundam Tanaka best
[3:02:37] <terminusterminal> Oh christ not the surfing game
[3:02:39] <terminusterminal> Oh wait
[3:02:45] <warmnoid> IMPROVED!
[3:02:46] <+LooglePlatinum> lol letter goblins nice love it Eli
[3:02:47] <jellssssss20> Nagito’s Luck still wins
[3:03:02] <%heartlesshealer> this minigame is so pointless
[3:03:14] <+LooglePlatinum> magnificent
[3:03:27] <+Mossinoda> But can you SPELL wallpaper? :)
[3:03:30] <arkv01> wallmart
[3:03:39] <SeValentine> waldo
[3:04:14] <+doctor_piranha> this mini game especially is dumb, no judgment here
[3:04:14] <CursedNobleman> ezpz
[3:05:11] <jellssssss20> I think 2 might have the worst mini games
[3:05:52] <Johnmaddened> oh dang Plague's been at this for three hours already? glad I didn't miss the whole trial at least
[3:06:18] <%Arancet> down plague down
[3:06:19] <+LooglePlatinum> here where im like how they combine two images with the actual evidence and just telling them use your mind to see
[3:06:58] <jellssssss20> What would you do with Super Ultimate Luck?
[3:07:01] <%Arancet> @Johnmaddened trial started recently, this was mostly investigating
[3:07:06] <CursedNobleman> LOGIC DRIVE? LUL
[3:07:13] <+LooglePlatinum> gamble lotteries
[3:07:20] <CursedNobleman> god yes LUL
[3:07:24] <Lan_Ran> 1080!!
[3:07:32] <SeValentine> Right....
[3:07:33] <+Promessa_EX> just don't call the game dumb when the answer becomes clear lol
[3:07:39] <%heartlesshealer> collect SKATE, but answers
[3:07:40] <+Promessa_EX> ah nvm
[3:07:42] <sosuke5> GAS GAS GAS
[3:07:47] <+Spacemarine501> SKATE
[3:07:48] <codizle> I LOVE YOU PLAGUE
[3:07:48] <+Mossinoda> ah yes i remember when i had to remember something and snowboarded through my mental headspace to solve the problem
[3:07:55] <jellssssss20> “Y’all remember this flash game?!”
[3:08:06] <LunarRemix> Those minigames are so weird. They're super simple, the developers weren't trying to do something new or unique, it had no passion or an idea behind it.
[3:08:15] <+LooglePlatinum> debate by scateboarding glad we didn't go for driving cars lol
[3:08:28] <LunarRemix> Swoop racing
[3:08:30] <Lan_Ran> Swoop Racing
[3:08:30] <CursedNobleman> paazak
[3:08:34] <%SirFancySwank> swoop race
[3:08:34] <%heartlesshealer> swoop
[3:08:36] <%gnollAUS> Swoop bike racing
[3:08:39] <Maids4lyfe> swoop
[3:08:45] <jellssssss20> Forward and back speeds up/slows down
[3:08:59] <jellssssss20> Swoopity swoop poop swoop
[3:09:05] <+Promessa_EX> there's evidence
[3:09:34] <+agumon9000> Incredibly obvious? Must be danganronpa
[3:09:38] <jellssssss20> This case is based on you not being able to walk around/view the crime scene
[3:09:45] <+LooglePlatinum> yup indeed
[3:09:45] <Johnmaddened> @Arancet ah thanks
[3:09:53] <xeros720> one of them isn't the ultimate painter are they?
[3:09:57] <+xiccy> That's one of the things I dislike about Dangan series. Their lives are supposed to be at risk and multiple characters play games with a gun to their heads.
[3:09:58] <jellssssss20> It’s pretty close
[3:10:03] <+agumon9000> Well you see they exist in a 2D paper cutout space not 3d silly
[3:10:38] <Jjaz_R> This is the dumbest shit NotLikeThis
[3:10:38] <+Promessa_EX> tape held the blood
[3:10:42] <+LooglePlatinum> or pool of blood coming out of pillar
[3:10:55] <jellssssss20> Wouldn’t the pillar be lumpy, like a body was in it?
[3:11:10] <+agumon9000> Its like double the size
[3:11:12] <jellssssss20> It’s like twice the diameter of the other
[3:11:34] <+Promessa_EX> he only looked into the room and ran out
[3:11:35] <%gnollAUS> A breeze could have broken the illusion
[3:11:46] <Samex_Comex> Geez they did the whole thing I thought they just cover her
[3:11:55] <xeros720> same
[3:12:03] <jellssssss20> No air moved in the room, no one breathed nor got close to it, lmao
[3:12:19] <+doctor_piranha> even though i love the series i get a kick out of you tearin it apart
[3:12:21] <+HawkGoggles2> "yeah, that makes sense" no, no it doesn't
[3:12:22] <%gnollAUS> Because game
[3:12:30] <+morphinepanda> now would that be fun?
[3:12:32] <Jjaz_R> I hate this so much
[3:12:33] <jellssssss20> It isn’t connected to the lighting though, how would they use the lighting?
[3:12:51] <LunarRemix> They should've done a Danganronpa like that before v3
[3:12:51] <+Spacemarine501> the plot demands convolution
[3:12:55] <jellssssss20> They only get to leave if they *get away with* killing them
[3:13:02] <+Onionchamp> Why would they even bother covering the pillar, this seems like it’s just to fucking waste time in the trial
[3:13:07] <wolfen091> I dozed off there for a second, alls I heard was hiyoko and pillar... is she a pillar man now?
[3:13:30] <masterdodo15> when can we get a friday night funkin mod from plague
[3:13:36] <%heartlesshealer> nagito no
[3:13:40] <+Who_lio42> only 15 foot tall wallpaper. not a big deal i guess
[3:13:49] <terminusterminal> "This is an imitation murder because they're both on a cylindrical object" lmao.
[3:13:53] <+Mossinoda> ........
[3:13:55] <+morphinepanda> @Onionchamp thats not what makes this dumb they explain that later
[3:13:55] <%Arancet> moss or moth?
[3:13:55] <wolfen091> @masterdodo15 id be totally down for that
[3:14:00] <+agumon9000> The fact you understand hyoko's body was hidden makes this entire portion entirely irrelevant
[3:14:08] <+LooglePlatinum> she has weird ball fetish
[3:14:12] <CursedNobleman> Marimo is a rare growth form of Aegagropila linnaei in which the algae grow into large green balls with a velvety appearance. The species can be found in a number of lakes and rivers in Japan and Northern Europe.
[3:14:17] <%heartlesshealer> a ball of moss
[3:14:20] <+Ashboldt> just a decoration
[3:14:32] <Maids4lyfe> a vegan pet rock
[3:14:38] <+HawkGoggles2> ACT
[3:15:08] <Samex_Comex> Fuck you Nagito
[3:15:10] <jellssssss20> The powers in this universe are broken, no matter what Nagito does, it’ll always turn out super well for him cause luck, I think Hajime just kinda has to exist generically? Maybe he’s the ultimate fate protag
[3:15:10] <LunarRemix> They really like movies
[3:16:15] <%heartlesshealer> this part feels like 999/VLR, but not as well done
[3:16:17] <jellssssss20> Yknow what’s easy? Putting rocks into a bodies pockets and dumping them into any part of the sea
[3:16:27] <+LooglePlatinum> no he the best
[3:16:42] <+Mossinoda> he had his one bit in the first trial and that's about it
[3:16:47] <+Ozymandias555> He’s a chuuni, let him have his fun
[3:16:50] <+Who_lio42> regardless hes a good boy
[3:17:04] <jellssssss20> He’s larp’ing
[3:17:29] <%mikesapartment> his parents were probably hamsters
[3:17:31] <@PeachSaliva> i hate the way he talks
[3:17:32] <jessegorilla> disappointed
[3:17:32] <+Who_lio42> not around
[3:17:35] <sosuke5> extreamly normal
[3:17:40] <LunarRemix> It's not larping when he actually acts like that 24/7
[3:17:44] <+Ozymandias555> Probably negligent
[3:17:48] <jellssssss20> If your parents liked anime probably Plague
[3:17:53] <%heartlesshealer> parents probably raised him on anime and naught else
[3:18:00] <+Spacemarine501> completly normal
[3:18:04] <CrimsonFox777> Chiaki has one of the most adorable pouts I've ever seen.
[3:18:06] <wolfen091> whats with the hamsters in his hands?
[3:18:18] <$Charlie99993> his parents were completely normal wolves
[3:18:19] <Maids4lyfe> he's a hamster breeder
[3:18:22] <+Who_lio42> hes the ultimate breeder
[3:18:22] <Maids4lyfe> that's it
[3:18:22] <+agumon9000> Don't you love how everyone has to speak in such a roundabout ways to make a single obvious question take 5 minutes
[3:18:27] <CrimsonFox777> @wolfen091 They're his "Four Dark Devas of Destruction" that live in his clothes.
[3:18:30] <jellssssss20> He’s ‘ultimate’ hamster breeder
[3:18:32] <+LooglePlatinum> they are his 4 DARK DEVAS OF DESTRUCTION
[3:18:34] <+Spacemarine501> so normal that he craves the bizzare
[3:18:59] <+Promessa_EX> CONSENT
[3:19:08] <+xiccy> Where's big man?
[3:19:09] <CrimsonFox777> Remember kids: Consent is cool!
[3:19:16] <$Charlie99993> @jellssssss20 any animal
[3:19:24] <+thatdamncoyote> She walked in blood, then on other things?
[3:19:27] <wolfen091> @crimsonfox777 really... hamsters... thats fucking weird
[3:19:30] <terminusterminal> Instantly?
[3:19:39] <+Who_lio42> I hope its not chris's blood...
[3:19:42] <%Arancet> maaaaybe if she stepped on splattered blood? but even then its smear with the next steps
[3:19:46] <+Ozymandias555> She could have been walking on blood splatters
[3:19:48] <%heartlesshealer> slice to neck, I wonder who has a -blade-
[3:19:50] <+Promessa_EX> @xiccy the big man is was taken away by monokuma after being injured
[3:20:08] <xeros720> oh, i always thought it was the, "they called for help before they died!" or something
[3:20:28] <Lan_Ran> Yeah throat slitting is already dying from either suffocation or liquid in your lungs at that point
[3:20:30] <jellssssss20> Oh that’s brutal yeah
[3:20:37] <+Spacemarine501> takes a few seconds at least
[3:20:44] <Lan_Ran> Or blood less
[3:21:02] <+xiccy> @xiccy Ah, forgot. Was wondering where the comments about shit were
[3:21:09] <terminusterminal> What?
[3:21:36] <+LordSDB> LUL Thats a good line
[3:21:49] <jellssssss20> Didn’t big guy like try to catch a missile or something
[3:21:58] <%heartlesshealer> Gundham, Ultimate Chuunibyo
[3:22:08] <@PeachSaliva> Is that Scott McNeil doing VO?
[3:22:11] <xeros720> look at that chunky boy on his shoulder
[3:22:23] <+LooglePlatinum> hai peach
[3:22:31] <wolfen091> gundham reminds me of pat, talk loud enough and it doesn't matter what you say
[3:22:35] <+agumon9000> Chris Tergliafera is Gundam's VA
[3:22:50] <+Ozymandias555> That might have been it though. All death really amounts to is hypoxia of the brain, so if all her blood left via the throat slash, it could be relatively quick
[3:23:00] <arkv01> remember the basics of BLUD
[3:23:00] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:23:11] <+Ozymandias555> Internal bleeding is the bad and slow one
[3:23:20] <+Damie904> ITS BLUD
[3:23:20] <xeros720> no, Tanaka is sounding stupid as hell right now
[3:23:23] <%gnollAUS> Blood on the ladder
[3:23:26] <TheAntiNihilist> 1573 IQ
[3:23:29] <+Promessa_EX> the tape
[3:23:31] <hamahiroyuki> I think the insta kill it's because also it's to avoid the mess of the crime scene of fighting victim. cuz THAT would be toooo hard to explain
[3:23:36] <xeros720> makes me wonder if a line of his is missing or something
[3:23:47] <@PeachSaliva> ye
[3:23:52] <+agumon9000> I think on the electronic ID everyone has the same evidence as you or something
[3:23:54] <Maids4lyfe> gundham acting like he's guilty
[3:23:57] <%Arancet> you have a photographic memory and your eye is a projector
[3:24:06] <wolfen091> look at this non existent photograph
[3:24:11] <%heartlesshealer> just imagine there's a monokuma screen in the center of the trial floor
[3:24:19] <xeros720> ^
[3:24:23] <+LooglePlatinum> exactly that my cringe of all these evidence scenes
[3:24:25] <jellssssss20> There are cameras everywhere so the producers pull it up for everyone
[3:24:40] <%Arancet> does it matter?
[3:24:47] <xeros720> someone was mentioning in an earlier stream that everyone has little tablets or something at their desks
[3:25:07] <jellssssss20> Oh, maybe they take pictures with their PDA’s
[3:25:13] <TheAntiNihilist> ....
[3:25:16] <vladtet909> That is not true at all
[3:25:27] <wolfen091> silly plague, gravity doesn't exist in japan
[3:25:34] <+Promessa_EX> she's upright
[3:26:04] <%Arancet> ...so?
[3:26:08] <jellssssss20> Yeah that’s just the explicit pressure from the heart that stops the massive splurts
[3:26:19] <+Who_lio42> Hiyoko is small, doesjnt have a lot of blood i guess
[3:26:30] <+Ozymandias555> @peachsaliva also, late but that’s Chris Tergliafera doing Tanaka
[3:26:35] <+agumon9000> Like logically if you were in the killing game you'd want to kill the smart people first and leave the dumb ones
[3:26:44] <xeros720> DR1 did that a lot, that stoner guy would just go on dumb tangents a decent amount
[3:26:58] <Lan_Ran> It feels like there's a wide gap between the smarter and dumber characters
[3:27:02] <TheAntiNihilist> yay. nagito talks
[3:27:10] <jellssssss20> But ghundam hasn’t done the one thing he’s in this story for yet
[3:27:30] <jellssssss20> He couldn’t just be useless, like other characters fully are lmao
[3:27:32] <@PeachSaliva> dispair? more like dis bear lol
[3:27:43] <TheAntiNihilist> greatest despair is suicide.
[3:27:51] <jellssssss20> Dis pair of goofs
[3:27:57] <+HawkGoggles2> What she didn't kill herself, no. Really?
[3:28:20] <Kunafish> whats your fave color plague?
[3:28:31] <+Ozymandias555> Monokuma also likes to bend the rules on a whim, if DR1 is any indication
[3:28:48] <Johnmaddened> magic plot disease
[3:28:48] <Maids4lyfe> despair disease what
[3:28:54] <+agumon9000> Aaaaaaanything could happen. Don't think about it
[3:29:14] <+Promessa_EX> so it's like star trek
[3:29:19] <arkv01> please andastand, crank suspension of disbelief up to 11 :)
[3:29:21] <Kierus_> I just got here and immediately hear someone say "despair disease."
[3:29:52] <jellssssss20> They always seem to reach a point in their plots where everyone more or less agrees to not kill each other and the plot has to bullshit and force them to, but I do think this part of 2 does it the worst
[3:30:02] <pillarsofsnow> That’s the point, it’s a rigged game, it’s not supposed to be  a “fair” outcome
[3:30:58] <Kierus_> Go back to the brown lady with big booba
[3:31:04] <Johnmaddened> @jellssssss20 oh you just wait LUL
[3:31:09] <pillarsofsnow> It’s Monkuma justifying sadism with “hope vs dispair”
[3:31:17] <jellssssss20> Oh he left thigh is soooo short yeah
[3:31:23] <Lan_Ran> The thighs are like 1/2 the size of the lower leg
[3:31:32] <xeros720> it looks like a 3d model tbh
[3:32:05] <jellssssss20> @johnmaddened Well I know, I’d say this despair disease is possibly the worst, except for the entirety of 3 as a whole but that’s a joke for another day
[3:32:09] <Kierus_> Due to how short my legs are, I'm very weak to hanging.
[3:32:12] <+LooglePlatinum> back to square one
[3:32:24] <funwashere> Feels like so much time has been wasted just to get to the point LUL
[3:32:24] <+LordSDB> I keep forgetting he has a fork and knife as his cross sign
[3:32:41] <+agumon9000> This entire trial hinges on the video only hajime ever sees
[3:32:49] <%SirFancySwank> thats mystery games in a nutshell, not just danganronpa
[3:33:02] <seth45er> why wouldn't a securtiy camera have a recording fuction? That so stupid!
[3:33:45] <jellssssss20> Then the footage would have a double layer of film grain and I dunno if this engine could handle it
[3:34:16] <+agumon9000> Headpat mode
[3:34:28] <Lan_Ran> Is the twist gonna be that Sonia has the weakest alibi?
[3:34:32] <jellssssss20> @seth45er You mean you don’t have strictly live streamed cameras around your house? Shit who put these here
[3:35:39] <TheAntiNihilist> she best girl
[3:36:56] <hamahiroyuki> it's almost 2:00 am here. thx for humor my ramblings. night night everyone
[3:38:13] <CrimsonFox777> Kreygasm
[3:38:16] <TheAntiNihilist> aka Milan has no alibi
[3:38:20] <+HawkGoggles2> Te-he
[3:38:28] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[3:38:29] <+LooglePlatinum> see why i like Mikan
[3:38:38] <TheAntiNihilist> because it's her alibi
[3:38:49] <+ribonodensetsu> new here, is there a way to see Plague's old streams for the beginning of this game?
[3:38:56] <CrimsonFox777> Cut her some slack, she's been watching over the sick and needs some sleep.
[3:39:11] <TheAntiNihilist> no...
[3:39:58] <+ribonodensetsu> awesome, I love this dumb game lol
[3:40:28] <pillarsofsnow> So we missed your reaction to big-kyuya?
[3:40:56] <Waypastfuture> fat byakuya
[3:40:56] <CursedNobleman> its a ball of algae
[3:40:57] <CrimsonFox777> Byaku-fat
[3:41:01] <CursedNobleman> native to japan
[3:41:03] <+shaidot> marimo
[3:41:09] <+agumon9000> The game literally wrote itself into a corner with a nonsense alibi segment which came out of no where and then when they went "welp that was pointless" Nagito just said up to say something random to actually move the plot along
[3:41:10] <Lan_Ran> "Hold on everyone, go take a piss break in the middle of this trial for our lives"
[3:41:10] <CalderGaming> marimo is the word, probably a lost in translation thing
[3:41:29] <CursedNobleman> does plague still think kuzu did it?
[3:41:34] <@PeachSaliva> There's a lot of sugar in milk tho
[3:41:37] <+Promessa_EX> milk is sweet
[3:41:41] <xeros720> yeah, the lactose
[3:41:43] <Maids4lyfe> milk tastes sweet though
[3:41:43] <+shaidot> I'd say it's sweet
[3:41:43] <LVL1_Scumbag> Lactose is a sugar
[3:41:44] <CursedNobleman> lactose is a sugar.
[3:41:48] <@PeachSaliva> yep
[3:41:49] <+Ozymandias555> Milk is sweet
[3:41:49] <%Arancet> you dont sugar your milk?!
[3:41:49] <+agumon9000> Also Moss Balls are a japanese thing you put in aquariums they are legit just green naturey balls
[3:41:51] <+shaidot> You can deep fry it too
[3:41:56] <blerrger19> Someone's never heard of cream
[3:41:59] <xeros720> probably talking about that condensed milk stuff though, that's super sweet right?
[3:41:59] <Zerotoad5> I didn't realize you were streaming 2 enjoyed the video on DR1
[3:42:00] <CrimsonFox777> Eh, it's kind of bland
[3:42:05] <+Promessa_EX> our pallettes are just screwed
[3:42:13] <xeros720> oh, try some whole milk some time if you get the chance
[3:42:16] <TheAntiNihilist> silly Plague. milk tastes sweet because it's from boobs. and boobs are sweet
[3:42:24] <xeros720> non-fat is really bland/watery in comparison
[3:42:29] <Lan_Ran> I love this spazzy dance song
[3:42:31] <+Ozymandias555> ^
[3:42:42] <@PeachSaliva> You drink raw milk?
[3:43:03] <dp4k> so who donnit plague?
[3:43:04] <xeros720> oh, curious how that is
[3:43:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:43:12] <+Ozymandias555> I switched to non-fat milk, got used to it, then tried whole milk, it was sweet as shit
[3:43:14] <wolfen091> yeah, non homo milk separates really quickly
[3:43:27] <vladtet909> Get yourself someone that looks at you the way Nagito looks at his right hand.
[3:43:36] <+LooglePlatinum> my night time partner so sorry to confuse you
[3:43:49] <Waypastfuture> he's reading the script whenever he looks at his hand
[3:44:06] <CrimsonFox777> "If only Left Hand-kun could be as awesome as you."
[3:44:38] <pillarsofsnow> @crimsonfox777 wow, just wow
[3:45:28] <$Rezca> Nails vs glue
[3:45:39] <Johnmaddened> 7.8/10 too much tape
[3:45:44] <%Arancet> shes a gamer, lowest score she can give is a 7
[3:45:44] <SuperVaderMan> "The imitator did a really bad job actually"
[3:46:00] <TheAntiNihilist> ...or maybe they aren't a psychopath
[3:46:01] <CrimsonFox777> NANI?!

[3:48:27] <Thewoodentree> If it aint the 5th I dont want anything to do with it
[3:48:45] <SuperVaderMan> The key was deep, deep inside
[3:48:57] <baronvonkame> a man of culture I see
[3:48:59] <+agumon9000> yes :)
[3:49:09] <Thewoodentree> If you really love your wife youll take her to court

[3:49:29] <SilverRoddo> plagueGripes_TK Shine on
[3:49:36] <Thewoodentree> low key wish she was more muscular.....
[3:49:39] <Mushroom_Master> I hated this
[3:49:54] <Johnmaddened> she too strong
[3:50:01] <CursedNobleman> grandpa plague and his frail button mashing NotLikeThis
[3:50:15] <SuperVaderMan> She's very loud, so therefore she's right
[3:50:20] <+Promessa_EX> it's all in the wrist
[3:50:21] <+Spacemarine501> and loud
[3:50:24] <dp4k> mashing sucks
[3:50:27] <Thewoodentree> peanut bridle fingers
[3:50:28] <Mushroom_Master> find me someone who has said out loud that mashing is fun
[3:50:54] <SilverRoddo> Never back down LuvPeekR
[3:51:06] <Thewoodentree> "Mashing is fun!"--Pat FuckBoivain Probably
[3:51:19] <$ethantheoutsider> My god this whole game makes me want to puke for several reasons
[3:51:24] <Phob05> Sonia says this only now
[3:51:45] <+Promessa_EX> leaves to go look at a mirror and dies

[3:53:10] <franctastic_> burn
[3:53:11] <baronvonkame> stop larping kid
[3:53:27] <ehStuGatz> so is tits mcgee the ultimate muscle or something?
[3:53:41] <CrimsonFox777> @ehStuGatz Ultimate Gymnist
[3:53:46] <TheAntiNihilist> the killer was prepping the noose and stuff
[3:53:57] <Jjaz_R> Akane is basically a Saiyan
[3:54:02] <Thewoodentree> Muscle Quest killed her
[3:54:03] <ehStuGatz> @CrimsonFox777 THAT is not the body of a gymnist
[3:54:04] <terminusterminal> All I know so far as "evidence" is that she made a shitty recreation of the lion thing
[3:54:47] <Johnmaddened> and they just killed her like that no problem yep
[3:55:00] <Thewoodentree> I mean she looked like she had a weak neck
[3:55:08] <CrimsonFox777> @ehStuGatz The game says she is. She's so good her body doesn't get in the way of things.
[3:55:20] <haydenthygreat> this trial sucks yeah lol
[3:55:42] <Waypastfuture> trial 3 is always kinda hsit
[3:55:44] <+agumon9000> the next one is uh
[3:55:46] <+agumon9000> yikes
[3:55:49] <Johnmaddened> 3rd trials are never really good
[3:55:49] <baronvonkame> supposition you say? in this game
[3:55:54] <Samex_Comex> Why the stupid movie angle?
[3:55:56] <CalderGaming> the last one wasn't great, this one isn't great...
[3:56:12] <Lan_Ran> If only there was evidence
[3:56:35] <terminusterminal> We don't need his help though?
[3:56:37] <TheAntiNihilist> they struggle to even make a murder timeline. it's pathetic
[3:56:39] <$Charlie99993> And the next one's the greatest
[3:56:52] <baronvonkame> idk i prefer 5 tbh
[3:57:00] <haydenthygreat> this is the worst trial in the series in my opinion
[3:57:46] <arvym2> the answer is yes Uncle Plague
[3:58:06] <Samex_Comex> She took the slippers off?
[3:58:47] <%gnollAUS> She took off her feet
[3:58:49] <%gnollAUS> OF COURSE
[3:58:51] <SuperVaderMan> just pop her feet off like an action figure
[3:59:07] <Thewoodentree> Another what and what situation?
[3:59:08] <Samex_Comex> She screamed really loud and floated
[3:59:28] <Thewoodentree> Walked on her hands
[3:59:44] <TheAntiNihilist> the shoes and suicide connection in japan?
[4:00:19] <Johnmaddened> she made a big jump
[4:00:31] <+agumon9000> "No bloodstains at all." Image clearly shows blood on the side
[4:00:43] <Samex_Comex> Ultimate MC
[4:00:50] <Johnmaddened> Ultimate Normal Guy
[4:00:53] <franctastic_> ultimate coward
[4:01:01] <$Charlie99993> Oh wait
[4:01:01] <+arcielardor> it's even more pathetic than you know
[4:01:03] <%Arancet> a step ladder!
[4:01:06] <Samex_Comex> Ultimate underwear collector
[4:01:10] <haydenthygreat> ultimate stupid head
[4:01:16] <$Charlie99993> I forgot about 4, 5 is the one I was thinking of
[4:01:35] <arvym2> no spoilers everyone
[4:01:44] <Thewoodentree> Super detectives always have photographic memory
[4:01:51] <+agumon9000> This whole case hinges on a video hajime only saw. What if Hajime is lying about the video?
[4:02:07] <dp4k> go surfing in YOUR MIND
[4:02:11] <Thewoodentree> Cuz killer taunt cop trope
[4:02:18] <Johnmaddened> everything
[4:02:21] <terminusterminal> No blood on the stepladder?
[4:02:22] <+Spacemarine501> hajume is the ulimate spoiler
[4:02:28] <warmnoid> style points for a sick murder
[4:02:33] <wolfen091> !raffle
[4:02:35] <haydenthygreat> This game is full of plot holes that's why
[4:02:43] <+arcielardor> the penis hanging out of the robe
[4:02:46] <Thewoodentree> what are the rectangles on the floor?
[4:02:47] <sosuke5> !raffle
[4:02:54] <terminusterminal> Too bad nobody dies to Judgement Cut End.
[4:03:27] <+Spacemarine501> the ends of the floor
[4:03:32] <+arcielardor> didn't she have painted nails?
[4:03:44] <haydenthygreat> shhhhhhhh
[4:04:00] <+arcielardor> oh
[4:04:14] <Johnmaddened> would you even be able to tell on a tiny monitor
[4:04:29] <TheAntiNihilist> @plagueofgripes why did you decide to play this series and review it in the first place?
[4:04:30] <haydenthygreat> Everything is suspicious
[4:04:52] <+LooglePlatinum> just so happens to be that one side huh
[4:05:36] <haydenthygreat> agreed
[4:05:55] <Johnmaddened> I can't unsee the thigh length
[4:05:55] <+SuspiciousJosh> suspicious indeed
[4:06:01] <seth45er> the ladder looks real.
[4:06:03] <+Promessa_EX> all objects in dr look like that
[4:06:05] <JeedyJay> It just looks weird in general
[4:06:15] <Thewoodentree> Game: Whats wrong with this drawing. Plauge: You suck and you should have tried harder.
[4:06:29] <$Charlie99993> It is a PSP game so it's a bit blown up from what it was
[4:06:34] <SuperVaderMan> Always have been
[4:06:42] <Futurecity10> Stop saying stepladder
[4:06:42] <dp4k> i love how the little pictures just freak out next time to them
[4:06:43] <Thewoodentree> only one step ladder exists on earth
[4:06:50] <haydenthygreat> im mad that ibuki died
[4:06:57] <+SuspiciousJosh> if I couldnt find one STEPLADDER where could I even find another stepladde
[4:07:00] <Thewoodentree> Help me step-lader im stuck
[4:07:03] <Johnmaddened> GAMING
[4:07:05] <calzonewithextracheese> ibuki was the only one i liked and she got killed smh
[4:07:07] <+agumon9000> no
[4:07:15] <+morphinepanda> where's my deduction skills?!
[4:07:19] <haydenthygreat> yep lol
[4:07:26] <+Spacemarine501> gamers rule
[4:07:33] <+agumon9000> Hangman's Gambit
[4:07:38] <haydenthygreat> Ibuki bae
[4:07:40] <+agumon9000> its a poor set up for Hangman's gambit
[4:07:41] <baronvonkame> OOF THE PRONOUNS
[4:07:43] <Johnmaddened> you know the thing
[4:07:47] <$Rezca> needs a comma somewhere
[4:07:47] <haydenthygreat> is that thing
[4:07:48] <+LooglePlatinum> as if Hajime already knows answer
[4:07:53] <CaptHat211> Is my Savior
[4:07:56] <SuperVaderMan> Time to spell knife
[4:07:56] <NashvilleSBA> language is my passion
[4:08:00] <franctastic_> OOF
[4:08:06] <Thewoodentree> da ting wit da murda
[4:08:15] <$Bigchill___> that place, at, that time
[4:08:15] <haydenthygreat> plaque of gripes do you enjoy this game?
[4:08:16] <franctastic_> Those ARE some words
[4:08:18] <+Promessa_EX> you can always prsss x
[4:08:28] <JeedyJay> People used to suggest these games to me back in the day, and I'm glad I never played them. If I played them when I was younger, I probably would have hated them to a hysterical degree.
[4:08:35] <%theloganbrand> Finger something
[4:08:46] <NashvilleSBA> how did plague handle meat on the bone?
[4:08:47] <+zepelinnn1> FIONE ON THE MEAT
[4:08:47] <Johnmaddened> fimger
[4:08:56] <+LooglePlatinum> anothervword for same
[4:08:56] <terminusterminal> film?
[4:09:02] <JeedyJay> "YOU GET TO MAKE A COMIC BOOK AFTER THIS!!"
[4:09:20] <baronvonkame> wow... I really repressed this trial huh? I dont remember any of this
[4:09:21] <haydenthygreat> Wooooo
[4:09:23] <+morphinepanda> Nah DR is cool
[4:09:39] <Johnmaddened> this minigame is really not great
[4:09:42] <+morphinepanda> this is just arguably the worst trial in the series
[4:09:49] <heart_raid_> oh yeah now i remember what this is supposed to be, this one is really dumb
[4:09:51] <haydenthygreat> This trial is forgettable I don't blame you
[4:09:54] <+agumon9000> Hangman's gambit is so fucking bad and especially for long shit
[4:09:55] <dp4k> nah you tripping morph
[4:10:02] <$Bigchill___> Filmers?
[4:10:03] <%Arancet> film-ing?
[4:10:06] <+LooglePlatinum> oh wait
[4:10:07] <+Ashboldt> oh gawd, it's one of those oversimplifications
[4:10:11] <+agumon9000> More letters might appear when you get the next letter
[4:10:11] <+StoicMoogle> filmed location maybe?
[4:10:12] <+shaidot> filming equipment?
[4:10:12] <baronvonkame> filming location?
[4:10:13] <sautong97> I think I figure out the answers
[4:10:14] <idkwayta> this is the first trial I see from the series
[4:10:16] <ducellion> filming
[4:10:18] <NashvilleSBA> isn't the third trial generally the worst in any of the games?
[4:10:19] <+Damie904> filming?
[4:10:23] <haydenthygreat> I forgot the answer lmao
[4:10:25] <$Charlie99993> I don't think he's reading chat
[4:10:26] <wolfen091> filming equipment sounds right
[4:10:32] <BigBanterCorbin> I M P R O V E D
[4:10:33] <Jakerham_Lincoln> filmore
[4:10:34] <franctastic_> filming?
[4:10:51] <franctastic_> TRIPOD
[4:10:53] <Thewoodentree> location?
[4:10:58] <+Ashboldt> it's like saying "the place is the place"
[4:11:00] <$Bigchill___> canister?
[4:11:05] <Johnmaddened> location probably
[4:11:08] <wolfen091> lighting
[4:11:11] <haydenthygreat> its location
[4:11:16] <+morphinepanda> @dp4k if this isnt what is? just tell me in numbers
[4:11:17] <%StridentSong> "You get to make a comic book after this!"
[4:11:17] <+not_crabby> is it literally the wors somewhere?
[4:11:19] <Johnmaddened> look at what is going on on this screen
[4:11:24] <+Promessa_EX> no one has ever completed it
[4:11:24] <wolfen091> limousine
[4:11:25] <Samex_Comex> So many C's
[4:11:25] <Johnmaddened> this is video game
[4:11:32] <+arcielardor> hope you like this game. you got like 12 more of these.
[4:11:53] <BurlyBeef> which trial is this
[4:11:56] <sautong97> before the minigame, I thought of the location being different but seeing so many letters also confused me too
[4:12:02] <franctastic_> "guys Is it me or Hajime is having a seizure right now?"
[4:12:07] <haydenthygreat> does he know you can concentrate?
[4:12:07] <+morphinepanda> This is 3
[4:12:10] <wolfen091> licorice
[4:12:16] <NashvilleSBA> isn't this what they called improved hangman's gambit?
[4:12:21] <+arcielardor> you can destroy some of those letters
[4:12:26] <Johnmaddened> """"improved""""
[4:12:27] <+Spacemarine501> good bye health
[4:12:34] <JeedyJay> You think is what's happening in Francis York Morgan's head when he's doing the chest tapping thing?
[4:12:36] <+shaidot> should be a crossword puzzle instead maybe?
[4:12:49] <haydenthygreat> "Improved"
[4:12:56] <haydenthygreat> lol
[4:12:58] <Thewoodentree> Would it be a valid strategy to just lock yourself in a room with a knife and let everyone else kill themselves?
[4:13:19] <NashvilleSBA> no because you need to attend and solve trials
[4:13:23] <SuperVaderMan> tfw you don't know if it's a plot point or if the game's just stupid LUL
[4:13:24] <Thewoodentree> ah
[4:13:28] <+Promessa_EX> the game should just not be on stores
[4:13:36] <BurlyBeef> LUL
[4:13:43] <haydenthygreat> thats smart never forgot about that
[4:13:48] <+SuspiciousJosh> they give you the sucker punch experience during the "hard parts"
[4:13:52] <haydenthygreat> thought
[4:14:13] <+arcielardor> much like trials in Japan
[4:14:17] <JeedyJay> Replacing them with QTEs would be dumb and nonsensical, but still an improvement.
[4:14:20] <SuperVaderMan> You could just be Ace Attorney LUL
[4:14:28] <haydenthygreat> Investigation minigames sound awsome
[4:14:39] <Thewoodentree> improv court
[4:14:46] <+Promessa_EX> i guess most players didnt mind
[4:14:53] <wolfen091> unless ur name is donald
[4:15:04] <Jjaz_R> This whole game should have just been a visual novel.
[4:15:12] <JeedyJay> My guess is that the aesthetic and style was doing all the heavy lifting, with these games
[4:15:15] <CrimsonFox777> Yeah, but if they all got their thoughts organized to make their case beforehand, Monokuma would get bored.
[4:15:16] <+morphinepanda> I hate trials but the overall game makes it worth
[4:15:21] <%gnollAUS> Well there is more then one curtain right?
[4:15:21] <terminusterminal> lmao
[4:15:23] <+zepelinnn1> TIME TO SURG
[4:15:24] <TheAntiNihilist> the "trial"= investigation, cross examinations, sentencing, and you also have every person in the court as a suspect and/or witness.  IT'S A GIANT GAME OF CLUE DURING A COURT CASE!
[4:15:26] <+zepelinnn1> *SURF
[4:15:29] <Thewoodentree> what the actual fuck
[4:15:39] <NashvilleSBA> what's that endless running game that this reminds me of?
[4:15:42] <terminusterminal> Oh my god I'm gonna soorf.
[4:15:55] <wolfen091> its the boarding level from reboot the game woolie hated
[4:15:55] <haydenthygreat> its called run
[4:16:18] <blerrger19> Are we still playing Danganronpa? Might need to change category
[4:16:35] <haydenthygreat> this trial is laughable
[4:16:36] <SoFarFetched> I always assume its you reaching with what sounds "logical" enough
[4:16:41] <Thewoodentree> The script is the only form of law i believe in
[4:16:43] <SoFarFetched> and working your way there
[4:17:03] <JeedyJay> God, this sucks
[4:17:10] <SoFarFetched> Like how Phoenix wright bluffs his way into guessing correctly
[4:17:32] <calzonewithextracheese> Danganronpa is just worse Phoenix Wright
[4:17:33] <haydenthygreat> danganronpa vs ace attorney
[4:17:33] <%Sweetangy021> Is it asking which camera or where the tampering took place?
[4:17:35] <+Promessa_EX> pheonix wright has literal ghosts
[4:17:43] <%Arancet> you dont remember mind surfing in your debate club?
[4:17:45] <Johnmaddened> do some rad debates on my digital snowboard
[4:17:52] <baronvonkame> god I rlly need to finish ace attorney, I'm on trial 3 game 1
[4:17:53] <+V3RTIGO_222> confused plague noises
[4:17:54] <+agumon9000> Simplify question "What did the Killer do with the Camera"
[4:18:01] <JeedyJay> Every time Phoenix Wright does something like this, the character has an internal monologue about how full of shit they are.
[4:18:06] <Thewoodentree> Court debate on motorcycles
[4:18:14] <blerrger19> Okay so if you pick the wrong choice you fall off the track, but there's no penalty for doing so. The choice is binary so you just get back on and pick the other choice
[4:18:25] <blerrger19> Without a fail state or penalty can you even call this gameplay?
[4:18:35] <JoshManVGH> You d
[4:18:43] <terminusterminal> Seems like you lose health for falling
[4:18:46] <+agumon9000> In Pheonix Wright the bluffs are mostly for an attempt to shake up the witness and get them to slip up and abuse that mistake
[4:18:54] <NashvilleSBA> there's health you lose when you get it wrong but the only penalty is starting from the begining of the minigame
[4:18:59] <haydenthygreat> It always happens
[4:19:07] <JoshManVGH> you do lose health. can you game over from that?
[4:19:13] <%StridentSong> If you end up doing V3, the translation team is different, and it's far better done. This game feels like they translated it based off an excel doc with no context
[4:19:18] <+Promessa_EX> The monitor was smashed at the venue
[4:19:20] <SoFarFetched> yeah you can game over when you lose health
[4:19:21] <terminusterminal> Man I hope so because otherwise you're super right
[4:19:28] <blerrger19> Okay so you can "fail" but this is actually just a huge waste of time
[4:19:47] <terminusterminal> But if somebody said I could play no other game but this surfer game I'd be done with gaming as a hobby.
[4:19:49] <funwashere> Basically, bs your way out of the trial LUL
[4:20:00] <blerrger19> The only point to these minigames is you HAVE to play through them in order to progress
[4:20:02] <CaptHat211> Boooo cut back to Owari!
[4:20:02] <JoshManVGH> Holy crap, mob kid became Majima
[4:20:04] <NashvilleSBA> yes the trials are mostly just frustrating unless things instantly click for you
[4:20:09] <Thewoodentree> aaaaaaand this is what happens when you let kids run a trial
[4:20:11] <+Promessa_EX> based on ITS IN PEICES
[4:20:17] <wolfen091> he ate it
[4:20:38] <SoFarFetched> Ah yes Titty Typhoon
[4:20:54] <+Promessa_EX> yea
[4:21:02] <blerrger19> I might actually be interested in this as a VN if the option to skip minigames and just read through the trials existed
[4:21:04] <haydenthygreat> this game has no logic
[4:21:05] <terminusterminal> But the camera is pretty big concealing it and putting it back would quite difficult
[4:21:17] <blerrger19> But the minigames are suffering
[4:21:42] <haydenthygreat> indeed
[4:22:06] <+agumon9000> HANGMAN'S GAMBIT AGAIN
[4:22:06] <Johnmaddened> MORE HANGMAN YEAH
[4:22:11] <SuperVaderMan> THAT place inside THAT building
[4:22:15] <haydenthygreat> WOOOOOOO
[4:22:19] <Thewoodentree> This tral would be over already if not for the mini games
[4:22:21] <NashvilleSBA> it doesn't help that dr2 has the worst minigame in the series
[4:22:21] <%KgKid51> RaccAttack my god
[4:22:22] <%gnollAUS> Eeeh, there is that second curtain
[4:22:28] <NashvilleSBA> ie this one lol
[4:22:28] <%gnollAUS> So whever ever that was?
[4:22:29] <%Arancet> ....just want the answer?
[4:22:31] <wolfen091> hahahaha the despair of plague
[4:22:31] <Samex_Comex> scottfPAINED
[4:22:44] <$Rezca> Blackout
[4:22:48] <sosuke5> 10 characters is too many to spell the word knife
[4:22:48] <%gnollAUS> No
[4:22:50] <+LordSDB> conference room?
[4:22:51] <+Spacemarine501> good bye rest of health
[4:22:52] <CrimsonFox777> Conference Room?
[4:22:56] <%Arancet> conference room
[4:22:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:22:59] <terminusterminal> hospitalll room
[4:23:01] <haydenthygreat> game over time
[4:23:18] <terminusterminal> Might as well burst them all to prevent overlap
[4:23:26] <baronvonkame> conference?
[4:23:29] <+shaidot> conference room
[4:23:31] <haydenthygreat> conference room
[4:23:33] <wolfen091> Confederate room
[4:23:55] <haydenthygreat> oh that rung a bell in my head
[4:24:02] <baronvonkame> god playing this minigame as boggle opposed to having an idea is suffering
[4:24:23] <wolfen091> confetti room
[4:24:23] <+agumon9000> Like in danganronpa where you are "time limited" to investigate and can only investigate once and everything needs to be solved at once in a trial. Destroying or moving evidence just seems so broken
[4:24:36] <+BloomingVillain> You can feed leftover letters to existing pairs
[4:24:57] <NashvilleSBA> i wonder if this minigame is better in japanese
[4:25:12] <haydenthygreat> I hope so
[4:25:24] <terminusterminal> Octoroon
[4:25:40] <haydenthygreat> this minigame is the worst
[4:25:41] <Johnmaddened> finally it's over
[4:25:45] <+shaidot> good save
[4:25:48] <Samex_Comex> Close one
[4:25:51] <+BloomingVillain> This makes N the big N
[4:26:02] <Thewoodentree> Theres a giant fucking tarp
[4:26:22] <+agumon9000> The only evidence that exists technically exists inside Hajime's brain
[4:26:42] <haydenthygreat> do you enjoy this game?
[4:26:52] <+agumon9000> Hajime's testimony is treated as fact because you the player saw it, but like no one asks what if hajime is lying about the video
[4:26:59] <Johnmaddened> imagine if Hajime went into another Hangman's Gambit again
[4:27:06] <funwashere> Evidence: Trust me bruh
[4:27:22] <+Promessa_EX> the player is doubted constantly, you actually get convicted in the first game
[4:27:23] <Thewoodentree> I like the aesthetic and all but that about it
[4:27:36] <+BloomingVillain> Also they dont have to prove anything, only convince
[4:27:42] <+agumon9000> The answer for this is super stupid
[4:27:48] <terminusterminal> lmao
[4:27:54] <Johnmaddened> NotLikeThis
[4:27:56] <SuperVaderMan> wow fuck off game LUL
[4:27:57] <Thewoodentree> ruh roh
[4:28:11] <haydenthygreat> the entire selling point for me are the charecters
[4:28:23] <ducellion> danganronpa moment
[4:28:29] <baronvonkame> im guessing whichever occured first if we have cause to believe either?
[4:28:31] <blerrger19> But Is IT ONE wAY oR tHE othEr?
[4:28:32] <%Arancet> everything is correct!
[4:28:35] <+BloomingVillain> One l
[4:28:36] <Johnmaddened> Consent with the stupid
[4:28:40] <just_3mpty> r o a s t e d
[4:28:40] <Zebroneath> EVERYTHING is true
[4:28:46] <Samex_Comex> Meat on the bone?
[4:28:49] <terminusterminal> I wonder if the second statement he makes is the one
[4:28:54] <haydenthygreat> Hajime is a stupid poopy head
[4:29:03] <blerrger19> YOu cAN'T uSE ReverSIbiLitY In eNGLISH tO MAkE thE saMe sENTENce bAckwArDs mEaN ThE SAME thinG LiKe YOU caN WitH eqUatioNs iN MatH--hURr DUrr
[4:29:10] <Thewoodentree> I think the curtain because you litterally have to remind them that they cant see whats behind the curtain
[4:29:21] <+Spacemarine501> the meat on bone
[4:29:43] <+LordSDB> I think the  "The conference room looked like the music venue" But yeah this is annoying
[4:29:55] <haydenthygreat> Pain
[4:30:05] <NashvilleSBA> i assume they want you to agree with the second kazuichi statement
[4:30:08] <terminusterminal> It might be the curtain on his second statement
[4:30:09] <+BloomingVillain> The existence of stupid characters and what they say in Japanese makes it hard
[4:30:20] <+agumon9000> @PlagueOfGripes You are trying to establish that the hospital is the filming sight not how its done
[4:30:25] <Maleicus> mmm
[4:30:35] <baronvonkame> wouln't the cvurtain be the evidence of the set?
[4:30:35] <Thewoodentree> Plauge sounding like a dad talking to his dumb ass kids
[4:30:36] <mef442> i would think its the music curtain on the set
[4:30:37] <Maleicus> i think camera will do it
[4:30:39] <baronvonkame> since they tore it down
[4:30:41] <+memento_mori2> all I feel is pain
[4:30:43] <Maleicus> if not the curtain
[4:30:54] <+arcielardor> there's no shame in using a guide
[4:30:57] <terminusterminal> It has to be the curtain right?
[4:31:06] <+SuspiciousJosh> curtain on the dudes second asnwerr
[4:31:08] <baronvonkame> cutrain set?
[4:31:12] <+RonizzleShizzle> music venue looks like the conference room
[4:31:13] <+Spacemarine501> its the paper
[4:31:17] <Thewoodentree> I think the curtain because they keep hammering about the location not being recognizable
[4:31:18] <haydenthygreat> I kinda think he should use a guide
[4:31:20] <Jjaz_R> I'm so glad it's not me playing this game.
[4:31:29] <mef442> ah mb
[4:31:30] <+SuspiciousJosh> on his second answer tho
[4:31:45] <%Arancet> consent to stupid
[4:31:46] <blerrger19> Try music venue curtain on look like the conference room
[4:31:46] <+RonizzleShizzle> you didn't try the second answer i think
[4:31:51] <Thewoodentree> this game will punish fun and you know it
[4:32:08] <+Spacemarine501> set implyes a third place?
[4:32:10] <paltar4> Just kill everybody these characters are insufferable
[4:32:21] <+agumon9000> @PlagueOfGripes You got the answer right first but the wording is reversed
[4:32:27] <+BloomingVillain> One looked like the other first?
[4:32:29] <%Void_The_Dark> There should be a button to hold to select buttons before the debate starts.
[4:32:35] <+RonizzleShizzle> @agumon9000 yep that's what i think too
[4:32:43] <+agumon9000> No you missed one
[4:32:48] <%Void_The_Dark> To select bullets＊
[4:32:53] <terminusterminal> You didn't try it on the second statement
[4:32:54] <%gnollAUS> The There is one you missed, when he swapps it
[4:32:59] <+agumon9000> You didn't do it on the second one
[4:33:00] <$Rezca> you didn't try on the second
[4:33:01] <+RonizzleShizzle> not the second
[4:33:03] <wolfen091> camera
[4:33:04] <+LooglePlatinum> no you didnt do the second one
[4:33:09] <+Spacemarine501> 2nd
[4:33:10] <+RonizzleShizzle> you didn't do the second one
[4:33:11] <NashvilleSBA> you haven't done the second one
[4:33:12] <blerrger19> Try curtain on look like conference room
[4:33:15] <+agumon9000> You just said they are the same but didn't actually do it
[4:33:16] <Johnmaddened> there you go
[4:33:18] <+SuspiciousJosh> mmmmm
[4:33:21] <haydenthygreat> wow
[4:33:29] <+SuspiciousJosh> mmmmmmmmmmm
[4:33:30] <+RonizzleShizzle> yep......
[4:33:35] <blerrger19> Wow that's completely ass backwards
[4:33:35] <ehStuGatz> you love it
[4:33:37] <Thewoodentree> Logic based entierly on reflexes
[4:33:43] <Johnmaddened> Danganronpa is awful I love it
[4:33:45] <+BloomingVillain> They arent the same technically
[4:33:51] <blerrger19> They used the curtain to make the conference room look like the venue, not the other way around. The hell?
[4:33:58] <+SuspiciousJosh> probably makes more sense in the japanese edit
[4:34:09] <haydenthygreat> I love danganropa cause it's awful
[4:34:21] <+Spacemarine501> love the tomgatche step counter the best
[4:34:32] <HelghastTroop> i always thought the appeal was just the weirdness of this series
[4:34:40] <blerrger19> DiD A look likE b, or did B LOOk liKe A? a = B tHEY'RE IdENtIcAL, buT wHICh one!?!
[4:34:45] <haydenthygreat> it basically is
[4:34:49] <+agumon9000> Ace Attorney has a similar issue but its like "No the answer is the evidence of the knife, its the PICTURE of the Knife"
[4:34:51] <%Arancet> yeah i enjoy this series but no getting around its fucking stupid in so many ways
[4:34:59] <Johnmaddened> gottem
[4:35:06] <Jjaz_R> I hate this so much, but I can't stop watching. It's like a train wreck.
[4:35:11] <SuperVaderMan> it's true, monokuma does look stupid
[4:35:24] <HelghastTroop> this sound track is vaguelly devil may cry almost
[4:35:30] <+Spacemarine501> trolling
[4:35:32] <terminusterminal> I've never seen flirting like that before.
[4:35:44] <Samex_Comex> How they hang it?
[4:35:45] <Thewoodentree> floor is floor
[4:35:47] <blerrger19> THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE
[4:35:54] <Maleicus> with a hanger
[4:36:06] <haydenthygreat> BOOBS
[4:36:15] <+LordSDB> Evidence that upgrades the FLOOR!
[4:36:34] <+Spacemarine501> But wait theres more
[4:36:40] <terminusterminal> Candle?
[4:36:42] <Thewoodentree> Doesnt matter, youll stumble to the truth and the killer will confess immediately
[4:36:55] <+LooglePlatinum> candle lighting
[4:36:59] <haydenthygreat> Curtain?
[4:37:05] <+not_crabby> rope?
[4:37:07] <@PeachSaliva> Pat talkin shit bout this on twitter
[4:37:24] <Thewoodentree> hi mustard queen
[4:37:39] <@PatStaresAt> y r u zelda
[4:37:42] <%Arancet> pat spoiling himself?!
[4:37:43] <+agumon9000> If you think too much and logically about trials then they fumble apart so just go with the flow
[4:37:47] <paltar4> My brain doesn’t have enough wrinkles to comprehend this high  iq game
[4:37:52] <BigManLugan> hi happy couple
[4:37:54] <%Arancet> hes a pretty pretty princess
[4:37:56] <Samex_Comex> Get it HANG up
[4:38:17] <Thewoodentree> but then we wouldnt have a plot
[4:38:22] <ehStuGatz> i lost track of what the fuck is going on since like an hour ago
[4:38:35] <Maleicus> im following it perfectly
[4:38:36] <baronvonkame> im glad i repressed this memory
[4:38:37] <%Arancet> its all just to confuse time of death it seems
[4:38:39] <haydenthygreat> it makes no sense at all
[4:38:43] <blerrger19> Sounds like the beach house all over again
[4:38:46] <SuperVaderMan> That seems to be a recurring thing. Spur of the moment murders that are also meticulously planned out
[4:39:08] <Thewoodentree> Perfect Murder: Stab a guy when no one is looking...then leave
[4:39:22] <Samex_Comex> They talk about so much none sense you forget what your even talking about
[4:39:28] <ehStuGatz> how bright was that candle unless it was the size of a road flare
[4:39:33] <+IDTheftVictim> A single candle will light up the room enough to let you know a candle is in the room
[4:39:33] <paltar4> Bash head with hammer throw body in dumpster one and done
[4:39:37] <Thewoodentree> Maybe its a GOOP candle?
[4:39:39] <%lettersofsky> maybe filmed in different places cause ibuki was dead long before hajime saw it?
[4:39:40] <+Spacemarine501> good smells
[4:39:47] <+Promessa_EX> ask johny young bosch
[4:39:52] <arkvc> LUL
[4:39:57] <Johnmaddened> the candle store
[4:39:58] <+FxyDEV> the candle store on island 1 of course
[4:40:01] <$Charlie99993> That's just what nero sounds like
[4:40:04] <CursedNobleman> maybe the monokuma store has candles
[4:40:04] <+RealThiele> yankee candle delivers
[4:40:07] <Jjaz_R> Is all Japanese writing this bad?
[4:40:10] <haydenthygreat> dead weight
[4:40:22] <+agumon9000> Btw Case 4 literally breaks instantly and before the murder even happens
[4:40:25] <SuperVaderMan> it should be no problem :)
[4:40:25] <Thewoodentree> They bought the Gwyneth Paltrow vagina candles in bulk
[4:40:27] <+FxyDEV> cant believe they kiled my wife
[4:41:04] <JoshManVGH> Oh no, they got the class president
[4:41:06] <+Promessa_EX> ah soda is knuckles... meme approved
[4:41:11] <sosuke5> there must be at least one
[4:41:13] <JoshManVGH> Makoto, whhhhhhhy
[4:41:15] <paltar4> Do the killers get something out of these overly complez murders like an occult thing
[4:41:15] <haydenthygreat> don't think its even possible
[4:41:21] <blerrger19> I just heard about a murder like that today actually
[4:41:34] <CursedNobleman> there are weirder DGR cases. actually, Dangan 2's case 5 is my favorite
[4:41:36] <Thewoodentree> like 99% of murders happen suddenly on the spot
[4:41:39] <MuskyMarauder> Yeah, there's this famous murderer out there. You may have heard of him - Hideo Kojima.
[4:42:02] <+lordericter> the games just have to have that one trial where people keep fucking with the evidence
[4:42:03] <CrimsonFox777> @paltar4 If they get away with the murder, they get to live. The complex stuff is completely their own thing though.
[4:42:04] <Johnmaddened> trial 2-5 might be the best one in the series
[4:42:08] <TheAntiNihilist> pretty sure murderers don't often try to make complex red herringa
[4:42:17] <baronvonkame> @CursedNobleman a man of culture i see
[4:42:40] <CursedNobleman> @baronvonkame its just so cool and insane!
[4:42:41] <Thewoodentree> jenga
[4:42:41] <+lordericter> black spine junka
[4:42:52] <+Spacemarine501> jenga
[4:42:56] <JoshManVGH> 4 teams of people wrote different parts of the same case or something.
[4:42:56] <baronvonkame> it's big stupid, I love it
[4:42:57] <haydenthygreat> true
[4:42:58] <CalderGaming> that's how normal jenga works too...
[4:43:08] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[4:43:20] <Johnmaddened> big ol' chest beefers
[4:43:21] <%Arancet> you have, many times
[4:43:21] <+Spacemarine501> love those episodes
[4:43:23] <CursedNobleman> @baronvonkame dangan V3 case 5 is good too, but i prefer 2-5
[4:43:27] <CrimsonFox777> Boingy boingy!
[4:43:33] <+BloomingVillain> Japanese production etiquette says make fast
[4:43:34] <+FxyDEV> 😳
[4:43:35] <haydenthygreat> Akane got those bongos
[4:43:37] <Thewoodentree> jinx
[4:43:40] <+lordericter> aww they killed off the scene girl, dang
[4:43:48] <+Damie904> So the main thing is when you dont have iron clad evidence for everything, you kind of need to at least work off an assumption, just to see where the logic might lead or could uncover.
[4:44:11] <Samex_Comex> Oh shit!
[4:44:16] <baronvonkame> @CursedNobleman yeah kinda same tbh, nothing against 3
[4:44:22] <+Damie904> And hopefully if the assumption is REALLY STUPID, it'll be proven so eventually.
[4:44:22] <+agumon9000> You did
[4:44:24] <SoFarFetched> this is slowly coming back to me
[4:44:29] <Thewoodentree> good thing they'er roughly the same height and size huh?
[4:44:37] <JoshManVGH> Uh huh... yeah. why is that a surprise for them here?

[4:44:58] <SuperVaderMan> Those dang math class ninjas
[4:45:00] <+agumon9000> @PlagueOfGripes Its like taking a math test that is filled with obvious answers yet the test says "Show your work"
[4:45:05] <Johnmaddened> LUL pretty much
[4:45:11] <haydenthygreat> Damn those math ninjas
[4:45:16] <Thewoodentree> only the strong will recieve a star sticker on their paper
[4:45:16] <JeedyJay> It's like figuring out what a game wants you to do before the tutorial wants you to get to that point, so you have to first show that you can walk first
[4:45:21] <CalderGaming> show your work by winning this episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple
[4:45:23] <Maids4lyfe> so it's like that episode from naruto
[4:45:32] <Thewoodentree> IMPOSSIBLE

[4:46:18] <wolfen091> @caldergaming run down the stairs through the temple gates into the shrine of the silver monkey

[4:46:42] <reonome> to trick you, the player
[4:46:44] <haydenthygreat> 3 sir
[4:46:45] <Jjaz_R> It could literally be anyone.
[4:46:46] <paltar4> The killer wants to have the top video on liveleak
[4:46:46] <JoshManVGH> It's like Hajime is... a prot‐ah-gone-est
[4:46:47] <CalderGaming> @wolfen091 but... but the answer is "four..."
[4:46:49] <%Arancet> @omniv_of_g0r 3, says in top left
[4:46:53] <+akumakid13> Pat sent me here. What chapter is this?
[4:47:02] <+RealThiele> that non-answer answer
[4:47:05] <haydenthygreat> this trial sucks pp
[4:47:08] <JeedyJay> "You've said no to too many reasonable things, and now I don't know which unreasonable thing to say so I can get back to reasonable options.."
[4:47:10] <+Spacemarine501> who do you think it is?
[4:47:12] <Maids4lyfe> ibuki's death
[4:47:16] <Thewoodentree> You good Sonia?
[4:47:19] <blerrger19> The stupid degree of convolution is the reason I hate most japanese anime and vn from the past decade or two
[4:47:21] <omniv_of_g0r> @omniv_of_g0r Thank you
[4:47:22] <%lettersofsky> so that ibuki's death looked like it occured later than it did probably
[4:47:30] <TIME_PUNCHER> Sonia intensifies
[4:47:41] <Thewoodentree> Sonia go brrrrrr
[4:47:53] <+BloomingVillain> Get fucked loser

[4:48:59] <CrimsonFox777> FeelsBadMan
[4:49:08] <haydenthygreat> thr game's logic is poop
[4:49:13] <+FxyDEV> im glad youre surprised at least
[4:49:17] <BurlyBeef> YEAH A LITTLE BIT
[4:49:21] <TheAntiNihilist> the murder was done earlier than you thought...
[4:49:21] <Garry_Guyface> tiiiime
[4:49:22] <reonome> >danganronpa >logic
[4:49:25] <Thewoodentree> Hey....confess so we can kill you please
[4:49:29] <Samex_Comex> Maybe she told Ibuki to do it?
[4:49:35] <Maids4lyfe> don't have an aneurysm please
[4:49:54] <SoFarFetched> well she was taking care of Ibuki
[4:49:55] <+morphinepanda> Applying real world logic to this series WILL kill u
[4:50:03] <SuperVaderMan> I correctly thought she was feigning confusion, so at least I guessed that right in this mess of a case LUL
[4:50:03] <haydenthygreat> it will
[4:50:09] <SoFarFetched> Titty Typhoon

[4:51:23] <TIME_PUNCHER> DONCHA THINK
[4:51:24] <wolfen091> tata tornado
[4:51:35] <JoshManVGH> Trap doors and other mystery clichés
[4:51:50] <+shaidot> the dagger they use to prove it was her had me stuck for awhile
[4:51:52] <+BloomingVillain> Dont try to prove you are smarter than a game, go for the ride and process later
[4:52:09] <blerrger19> Mikan didn't do it--she told Ibuki to do it, but that would make Ibuki a tool and tool's don't kill people. Therefore the TRUE killer is Mikan herself except we learned before that tool's CAN be responsible for murder and therefore its not Mikan--it is in fact Ibuki. Rather it WOULD be Ibuki except Mikan also killed Ibuki so she IS a killer too, and the only one left alive to be convicted!!
[4:52:16] <CursedNobleman> how does the logic in dangan compare to phoenix wright?
[4:52:41] <Thewoodentree> damn you artist model man
[4:52:49] <+FxyDEV> Was Fuyuhiko in the hospital ?
[4:52:51] <baronvonkame> I dont think Phoenix is AS anime
[4:52:51] <+shaidot> dangan really reaches a lot
[4:52:58] <BurlyBeef> Hacker Nurse
[4:53:14] <Samex_Comex> Did she choke Ibkui like she almost did with you when she was sleeping?
[4:53:17] <Johnmaddened> I don't remember Ace Attorney taking this many leaps in logic
[4:53:19] <Thewoodentree> the what disease?
[4:53:26] <Maids4lyfe> despair disease
[4:53:30] <CursedNobleman> plot disease LUL

[4:53:55] <BurlyBeef> +1
[4:53:57] <+xerioes> ace attorney can be just rediculous in premase but its evidence and logic is way mor sound than this circus
[4:53:58] <Maids4lyfe> it's like Junko became a virus
[4:54:00] <Maids4lyfe> or something
[4:54:02] <SuperVaderMan> I think I'm suffering from Despair disease, and it's called Danganronpa
[4:54:02] <paltar4> Despair disease what a creative name lol
[4:54:02] <Maids4lyfe> who knows
[4:54:05] <haydenthygreat> ha ha
[4:54:05] <+LordSDB> It was cured after the bodies was discovered cause Monakuma was glad someone died I think
[4:54:07] <+shaidot> bingo
[4:54:09] <terminusterminal> dabbed
[4:54:10] <Maids4lyfe> it's like Paranoia Agent
[4:54:14] <Maids4lyfe> Little Slugger
[4:54:21] <haydenthygreat> very funny
[4:54:21] <Maids4lyfe> mass hysteria
[4:54:29] <Laecerelius> They need to have the de-evolution disease from TNG
[4:54:34] <Thewoodentree> Doesnt that mean you can assume literally anyone killed literally anyone else for literally any reason
[4:54:37] <arkvc> nagito ain't fucking tonight
[4:54:37] <+agumon9000> There is literally nothing preventing Mikan from saying "How do we know YOU didn't do it Hajime"
[4:54:58] <+Promessa_EX> @Maids4lyfe i feel you but i think plague is just going to hate all of that anyway, and he's not gonna watch the anime
[4:55:06] <baronvonkame> nothing but ploit armor
[4:55:07] <SuperVaderMan> Danganronpa sucks huh
[4:55:08] <Thewoodentree> maybe a gas that gets airvented in?
[4:55:10] <TIME_PUNCHER> plot disease, plot cure
[4:55:14] <CursedNobleman> @agumon9000 the argument to disprove hajime was the first bullet
[4:55:21] <Thewoodentree> wench
[4:55:22] <Maids4lyfe> the anime is hot garbage anyways @Promessa_EX so no real loss there
[4:55:31] <haydenthygreat> there is no cure for this disease of a trial
[4:55:35] <Maids4lyfe> lmao

[4:55:59] <+Spacemarine501> sad noises
[4:56:06] <SuperVaderMan> How much you wanna bet she does an anime 180 and becomes a completely different character
[4:56:06] <franctastic_> WEEEEELLLL
[4:56:07] <paltar4> Don’t fall for her tricks she is a cold blooded killer
[4:56:09] <%KgKid51> JUSTICE
[4:56:13] <+xerioes> here comes an actual ninja
[4:56:17] <Thewoodentree> Tanaka straight up hates women
[4:56:21] <Maids4lyfe> but she's the kind of person that snaps and shoots up a park or someplace
[4:56:24] <warmnoid> "we have undeniable proof she's the killer but she's crying!"
[4:56:27] <+HawkGoggles2> I'm about to hate you
[4:56:30] <professorno> big titties stick together
[4:56:36] <Phob05> Mikan has 4 personalities and they're all murderers
[4:56:39] <baronvonkame> S I M P I N
[4:56:40] <TIME_PUNCHER> man she's milking it like the udder of immortality
[4:56:44] <jessegorilla> everyone disliked that
[4:56:45] <Thewoodentree> This is the America's Got Talent of Murder cases
[4:56:46] <+agumon9000> @CursedNobleman Hajime's innocence was predicated on the fact that they thought Saionji was killed after Ibuki and while Chiaki was with Hajime but since we now know both murders happened before Hajime's alibi has literally nothing
[4:56:52] <BurlyBeef> "Are you really trying to blame our milktruck of a nurse?"
[4:57:02] <TheAntiNihilist> the virus IS the twist...
[4:57:17] <BlueLunecy> Crazy eyes to the rescue once again
[4:57:24] <Maids4lyfe> oh my god
[4:57:33] <CalderGaming> "i wasn't paying attention but I read the script just now and,"
[4:57:34] <Phob05> If she killed because of the virus then wouldnt monokuma be the killer?
[4:57:36] <Thewoodentree> The Virus WAS the nurse all along
[4:57:40] <TIME_PUNCHER> YOU
[4:57:48] <haydenthygreat> Nagito carry
[4:57:51] <+agumon9000> Also him not seeing the movie has been proven to purely be chalked up to coincedence
[4:57:54] <Thewoodentree> please tell me he confesses himself
[4:58:09] <+HawkGoggles2> "I'm a fucking genius"
[4:58:12] <Johnmaddened> this ISN'T a video game
[4:58:12] <JoshManVGH> wow this is really pulling it out of it's ass, huh?
[4:58:13] <SuperVaderMan> ResidentSleeper
[4:58:22] <@Nightbot> @Chaos_kun -> Questionable judgement. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:58:37] <Chaos_kun> weegeeSleep weegeeSleep
[4:58:40] <haydenthygreat> My least favorite thing about danganronpa is how drawnout it is
[4:58:50] <CursedNobleman> damn criminals in the supermarket
[4:59:00] <JoshManVGH> They sell GUNS... and fresh market eggs
[4:59:07] <TIME_PUNCHER> Crime-mart
[4:59:09] <Thewoodentree> Im gonna head to 7/11 to get a gun and some cocaine, you guys want anything?
[4:59:17] <%Arancet> Bloodbath & Beyond
[4:59:27] <%mikesapartment> loopibooki
[4:59:34] <paltar4> The nurse is a renaissance woman she knows the hangman knot
[4:59:36] <JeedyJay> Does even Golden Sun drag shit out this long?
[5:00:00] <Jjaz_R> WHY THE FUCK WASN'T THAT A DISCOVERABLE CLUE THEN?
[5:00:06] <SuperVaderMan> Ropes are not that fragile
[5:00:07] <Thewoodentree> rope wont fray on human skin
[5:00:10] <CursedNobleman> i concur with eli
[5:00:12] <baronvonkame> it was rubbing on itself I guess?
[5:00:13] <$Rezca> Yeah... ropes are more resilient
[5:00:14] <Mushroom_Master> scratchy neck
[5:00:15] <Phob05> That's some quality stranglin
[5:00:18] <haydenthygreat> lol
[5:00:18] <Maids4lyfe> but it's ANIME rope
[5:00:19] <Lord_Siking> Here we go again atpCap
[5:00:20] <%gnollAUS> Or fray on itself
[5:00:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's superior nippon rope
[5:00:29] <+Spacemarine501> rope on rope?
[5:00:31] <+MisterRockett> How is it not the best option????
[5:00:32] <TIME_PUNCHER> rope physics
[5:00:33] <+Promessa_EX> she wears a spiked collar doesn't she
[5:00:37] <Thewoodentree> its hemp rope
[5:00:45] <CursedNobleman> damn low quality anime rope
[5:00:46] <+arcielardor> but look at all those piercings she's got
[5:00:51] <JeedyJay> It doesn't press deep enough
[5:00:53] <+arcielardor> it'll fray
[5:00:54] <Garry_Guyface> store-grade paper rope
[5:00:55] <JoshManVGH> The M Night Shamalan method of story telling. Dead end? Add a Surprise Twist!
[5:00:55] <Maids4lyfe> hemp is stronger material so it would fray even less
[5:01:02] <CursedNobleman> you want cord, not rope.
[5:01:02] <Maids4lyfe> EDUCATIONAL
[5:01:05] <haydenthygreat> funny rope clue
[5:01:22] <+tempestzephyr> weirdly specific knowledge...hmmm
[5:01:25] <TIME_PUNCHER> Eli the writer researching his murder plots
[5:01:29] <BlueLunecy> We'll make sure to implicate you when we kill someone Plague. Thanks for the info
[5:01:29] <Thewoodentree> just hit em with a brick and call it a day
[5:01:33] <JackPot_ALX> You need to know these things in Farmsville
[5:01:34] <Lord_Siking> can probably just crush the throat at an angle like that
[5:01:43] <vladtet909> If you pulled a rope hard to fray it on a persons neck you'd likely cause their head to pop off first.
[5:01:54] <+xerioes> man alot of things in this games is just slayed by "Thats not how it works"
[5:02:01] <Thewoodentree> Nagito are you high?
[5:02:12] <Maids4lyfe> rope burns on the killer's hands maybe?
[5:02:16] <haydenthygreat> yes
[5:02:18] <%mikesapartment> they make fun of this trial in the next game
[5:02:22] <Johnmaddened> the next ones get better
[5:02:23] <CursedNobleman> is this trial considered the worst in the series? LUL i think it is?
[5:02:23] <JeedyJay> Nagito, I am going to punch you in the ear
[5:02:28] <haydenthygreat> rope burns ha ha
[5:02:38] <+morphinepanda> Yes
[5:02:44] <%KgKid51> 🛌🛌🏾
[5:02:53] <SuperVaderMan> Hajime just over there making pew pew noises and finger guns 🔫
[5:02:54] <BurlyBeef> hey look is that the script
[5:03:02] <Johnmaddened> this moment was pretty good though I think
[5:03:11] <terminusterminal> People argue while plague makes blasting noises with his mouth
[5:03:14] <franctastic_> oh my god I think there's a reason why he looks at his hand
[5:03:41] <paltar4> Wouldn’t a suspension hanging have the same marks as a strangle by rope
[5:03:56] <Maids4lyfe> thickGUN
[5:04:01] <Maleicus> no?
[5:04:05] <+shaidot> focus on mikan
[5:04:09] <JoshManVGH> Did the nurse assess the body or something?
[5:04:09] <mef442> there might be more bullets?
[5:04:14] <+BloomingVillain> I think the killer was SUPPOSED to be Fuyuhiko but they didnt want to make his tragedy pointless. But then they would need to revise a lot.
[5:04:16] <NashvilleSBA> does any relate to mikan examinging the body?
[5:04:20] <franctastic_> a surveillance camera?
[5:04:20] <+Damie904> I missed it but did Mikan give any details only she knew as ultimate nurse lady?
[5:04:22] <wolfen091> @joshmanvgh thats my question
[5:04:23] <Samex_Comex> The rope was yellow in the video?
[5:04:38] <CursedNobleman> mikan couldnt give her usual time of death estimate because of the temperature of the room
[5:04:45] <NashvilleSBA> cause I think chiaki is implying a medical professional should recognize the difference
[5:04:45] <+shaidot> mikan lied
[5:04:47] <+xerioes> im thinking someones lie
[5:04:52] <Johnmaddened> consent with pepsiman
[5:04:54] <Thewoodentree> So your honor i just started blasting
[5:05:00] <TheAntiNihilist> lol
[5:05:01] <+not_crabby> good shot
[5:05:16] <SoFarFetched> "no doubt"
[5:05:33] <SoFarFetched> well no one questioned her because she's a nurse
[5:05:44] <Thewoodentree> Thats a paddlin
[5:05:48] <Phob05> even though she was the one doing the autopsy, also how strong is she?
[5:05:50] <SoFarFetched> so its like "well you're a nurse,I believe you"
[5:06:01] <JoshManVGH> You did a fibbin' Mikan.
[5:06:09] <Maleicus> updated autopsy report
[5:07:02] <CursedNobleman> bully mikan! LUL
[5:07:17] <wolfen091> why is a highschool kid the ultimate nurse, shouldn't it be some person in their 50s
[5:07:18] <+Damie904> Autopsy specialist can usually tell what's a cause of death and post death. But that's also an assumption of her skill.
[5:07:21] <baronvonkame> she did expressly confirm it tho didnt she
[5:07:25] <Maleicus> that was no omission she said it was hanging
[5:07:26] <+Damie904> So flimsy world logic
[5:07:35] <CalderGaming> CAN THEY??????
[5:07:42] <Thewoodentree> Get fucked Mikan
[5:07:45] <CrimsonFox777> How drunk we talking here?
[5:07:50] <TIME_PUNCHER> Time to get drunk and learn medicine to find out
[5:07:54] <BlueLunecy> I can't disprove that
[5:07:54] <JoshManVGH> I'm not sure that's true.
[5:07:56] <CursedNobleman> hanging is a broken neck, if you do it right
[5:08:07] <Maids4lyfe> the rope burn would have a different shape if she hung
[5:08:12] <$Rezca> tee hee
[5:08:14] <JoshManVGH> Medical Students aren't Sherlock Holmes analogs
[5:08:23] <+HawkGoggles2> Her guns
[5:08:24] <+RealThiele> ma ma
[5:08:25] <CrimsonFox777> LUL
[5:08:27] <%Arancet> are they lead?!
[5:08:29] <Lord_Siking> booba
[5:08:33] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[5:08:37] <+Damie904> Body Weight + tight rope And Tight rope around body, would leave different enough markings.
[5:08:40] <wolfen091> dropped from orbit
[5:08:46] <CursedNobleman> plot disease!
[5:08:53] <+Damie904> tight rope strangled around neck*
[5:09:07] <denastes> Kreygasm
[5:09:11] <Thewoodentree> Wow she immediatly flipped on her
[5:09:22] <Phob05> Why did she need to use her beefy man arms to strangle Ibuki?
[5:09:23] <+LooglePlatinum> here we go
[5:09:36] <+IDTheftVictim> How dare you not nurse me!
[5:09:40] <Maleicus> like he would care about that
[5:09:40] <+RealThiele> hidden subplot activate
[5:09:52] <+BloomingVillain> But his eyes are so hot
[5:09:55] <Thewoodentree> Your a killer but we all like you, so dont do it again okay
[5:10:06] <Samex_Comex> Yes go away Nagito
[5:10:10] <CrimsonFox777> Same FeelsBadMan
[5:10:14] <Jjaz_R> I hate Nagito so much
[5:10:14] <TIME_PUNCHER> death by motorboating
[5:10:22] <+IDTheftVictim> Why do they shake the picture but not the actual avatar?
[5:10:23] <baronvonkame> i pinky swear guys
[5:10:23] <CursedNobleman> its usually beat the [noun] out of you
[5:10:30] <+SuspiciousJosh> death by motor boating indeed
[5:10:36] <wolfen091> @time_puncher thats called suffocating
[5:10:46] <Thewoodentree> stop figuring out  the murder you meany
[5:10:50] <JoshManVGH> Ultimate (Malpractice) Nurse
[5:10:52] <haydenthygreat> they burned the script
[5:10:56] <warmnoid> this case almost made me stop playing the game
[5:11:00] <Maleicus> the avatar shaking probably looks too weird
[5:11:06] <CursedNobleman> death by suffocating. mans most desired death. second to death by snusnu
[5:11:14] <Lord_Siking> I believe everyone because im a good person :)
[5:11:16] <+shaidot> it is
[5:11:18] <Phob05> boy does it
[5:11:19] <terminusterminal> Liar Game did this doubt idea way better
[5:11:21] <+Spacemarine501> ultimate Angel of Death
[5:11:25] <Thewoodentree> let anime Jesus into your heart
[5:11:31] <NashvilleSBA> chiaki becoming the ultimate catholic
[5:11:31] <JoshManVGH> Forgive the ruthless killer
[5:11:32] <+V3RTIGO_222> oh god, this is japanime reasoning
[5:11:36] <ShockzNDrawe> "Just because you're right, doesn't make you correct"
[5:11:38] <SoFarFetched> Look Akane only focuses on food. big tiny words are deep for her.
[5:11:41] <+IDTheftVictim> Deep is relative
[5:11:43] <wolfen091> heart of the cards guys
[5:11:46] <TheAntiNihilist> no it's not.  you want to believe they wouldn't be capable of killing
[5:11:48] <JoshManVGH> Reference photo
[5:11:50] <CalderGaming> trust but verify Kappa
[5:11:51] <+Ashboldt> or faith or whatever
[5:11:52] <SuperVaderMan> Time of an anime monologue about nothing
[5:11:53] <Thewoodentree> WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYING YOU HIGH BITCH
[5:11:56] <Jjaz_R> NotLikeThis
[5:12:00] <TIME_PUNCHER> Oh good, the kids figured out reasonable doubt
[5:12:00] <+LooglePlatinum> last meat shield is gone, time to make a desperate struggle
[5:12:02] <terminusterminal> And hope leads to the dark side
[5:12:08] <+SuspiciousJosh> are they gonna have there anime laugh at the end of the trial
[5:12:09] <haydenthygreat> anime trash
[5:12:10] <Johnmaddened> you nailed the dialogue LUL
[5:12:12] <+FxyDEV> are?
[5:12:13] <JoshManVGH> Friendship
[5:12:15] <SoFarFetched> Akanes like "FINE doubt your friends"
[5:12:16] <Thewoodentree> just like that
[5:12:16] <SuperVaderMan> Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate... leads to suffering!
[5:12:21] <franctastic_> I actually kinda like Chiaki's speech here
[5:12:28] <CrimsonFox777> And she breaks
[5:12:29] <%KgKid51> oh no LUL
[5:12:29] <Johnmaddened> bitch mode on
[5:12:34] <+Ashboldt> She should have just kept playing the part
[5:12:35] <Thewoodentree> she almost got off the hook
[5:12:40] <Thewoodentree> and then immediatly confesed
[5:12:46] <paltar4> Come on this is dumb
[5:12:50] <+RealThiele> its YOUR fault i murder
[5:12:50] <SuperVaderMan> Is this where she does an anime 180 an d change character- there it is
[5:12:51] <+Promessa_EX> chiaki just said it's important to verify instead of believing blindly on faith
[5:12:52] <mef442> i feel like they should have said "faith" instead of belief
[5:12:54] <TIME_PUNCHER> what
[5:12:59] <SoFarFetched> the "breakdown"
[5:13:01] <SuperVaderMan> Caaaaaalled it
[5:13:02] <+IDTheftVictim> Ok, voice actors are having fun
[5:13:03] <wolfen091> its too long
[5:13:11] <CursedNobleman> worst trial in the series. its all uphill from here! LUL
[5:13:12] <NashvilleSBA> would you say it's the worst so far?
[5:13:15] <+Gameroftime12> Yeah this trial isn't very good
[5:13:19] <Phob05> this is also very japanese
[5:13:19] <TIME_PUNCHER> calm down, Fluttershy
[5:13:30] <+Gameroftime12> One of the worst in the series
[5:13:41] <ShockzNDrawe> the next couple trials are pretty all right
[5:13:42] <+FxyDEV> class 3 trials are not great
[5:13:44] <Mushroom_Master> case 3 curse
[5:13:47] <Thewoodentree> why are you mad that i killed someone, i said sorry
[5:13:54] <haydenthygreat> the celeste one was AWFUL
[5:14:03] <+BloomingVillain> Every game, yes
[5:14:38] <BrachyZoid> 15 raiders from BrachyZoid have joined! 
[5:14:38] <+Masterdoomsamus> birthday butt
[5:14:41] <Thewoodentree> Cuz hes a drama queen
[5:14:42] <BrachyZoid> Birthday Butt!!
[5:14:44] <baronvonkame> at least they gave us the apology letter of a next trial
[5:14:46] <franctastic_> @PlagueOfGripes what do you think about the voice acting?
[5:14:46] <%Sweetangy021> For a who done-it that sounds way worst than the Celeste case
[5:14:52] <+Ashboldt> there's still an issue???
[5:14:58] <ShockzNDrawe> Nagito's...
[5:15:00] <BrachyZoid> GOD I wish I was drawing
[5:15:01] <ShockzNDrawe> interesting
[5:15:03] <+morphinepanda> they are just high school students who are really good at something
[5:15:06] <wolfen091> we must fight off the raiders, protect the ship!
[5:15:15] <SuperVaderMan> So what the fuck was Nagito on about before? You were all doubting Mikan, and now you're back to doubting Mikan again. What did he accomplish
[5:15:43] <phatmac16> He’s a crazy wacky man
[5:15:54] <Artista_AF> thanks for streaming Brachy, happy birthday brachy1Pat
[5:15:58] <BrachyZoid> brachy1Brabuns
[5:15:58] <CursedNobleman> music helps this game a ton. its why i wasnt interested in gnosia
[5:16:02] <SoFarFetched> they'll get there "eventually"
[5:16:10] <+Ashboldt> can you? or you??
[5:16:19] <terminusterminal> We didn't prove anything on the road to this accusation why should she?
[5:16:27] <justcallmebobplease> That's not what Japan believes, Plague.
[5:16:28] <CalderGaming> hah, AMERICAN jurisprudence
[5:16:30] <TheAntiNihilist> not in Japan
[5:16:36] <+arcielardor> it is in Japan
[5:16:41] <ShockzNDrawe> Some trials really feels like they're really trying to force the narrative to go a certain way
[5:16:55] <TIME_PUNCHER> show me your... proof. yes, proof
[5:17:29] <%gnollAUS> Japan has a really high conviction rate. Like a lot of innocent people going to jail as there is no way they are that good at solving crimes. So long as someone is charged, crime solved right?
[5:17:53] <franctastic_> according to Judgement, Japan has a 99.9% conviction rate
[5:18:02] <Thewoodentree> yes.....yes she is
[5:18:08] <ShockzNDrawe> Yeah that's sort of a thing where after a certain point the culprit sharts losing their shit
[5:18:21] <ShockzNDrawe> and after that point there's never any kind of subversion
[5:18:22] <Maleicus> do it slave boy
[5:18:22] <+LooglePlatinum> this brad is emotionally unstable lol
[5:18:23] <%Sweetangy021> That line came straight out of the 50s
[5:18:26] <hazzy_o7> you play the mini game!
[5:18:28] <Samex_Comex> You can do it MC
[5:18:30] <+SuspiciousJosh> do everything for us hajime
[5:18:38] <+SuspiciousJosh> akane will knock mikan out of the park
[5:18:44] <Thewoodentree> Hajime i want ice cream
[5:18:45] <%mikesapartment> go ahead and tell them mako- hajime
[5:18:45] <TheAntiNihilist> Sonia is daydreaming right now. leave her alone
[5:18:49] <Samex_Comex> New wife
[5:18:50] <BlueLunecy> Akane would just jump her podium to attack her opponent. I'd watch that
[5:18:56] <SuperVaderMan> Why even bother with proving anything beyond this point? Everyone just votes on who they think did it anyway, no actual proof is required beyond just convincing them of who did it
[5:18:59] <Thewoodentree> no :)
[5:19:06] <TIME_PUNCHER> Forgive her for WHAT
[5:19:07] <+BloomingVillain> Yes?
[5:19:20] <haydenthygreat> FORGIVEEE MEEEE
[5:19:31] <baronvonkame> it's kinda amazing perjury isn't a thing until 3
[5:19:54] <CursedNobleman> this section is awful LUL
[5:20:46] <Thewoodentree> I activate crazy dame mode
[5:20:53] <CursedNobleman> this is tharja/razmi/etc
[5:21:00] <TIME_PUNCHER> candlelight?
[5:21:05] <Jjaz_R> Why couldn't it be Akane or Nagito?
[5:21:05] <TIME_PUNCHER> what
[5:21:06] <+shaidot> use memory
[5:21:13] <Maleicus> no
[5:21:18] <mef442> for someone that didnt see the video that sure is an ace discription
[5:21:18] <Maleicus> only hajime
[5:21:20] <terminusterminal> Are they doing the ace attorney thing? She knows a detail she shouldn't?
[5:21:22] <sosuke5> Oh it's one of these, this is going to take a while
[5:21:27] <haydenthygreat> I know the answer if you need it
[5:21:33] <+LooglePlatinum> nope
[5:21:41] <SuperVaderMan> We're so twisted up in Danganronpa logic that we just kinda have to go with it at this point
[5:21:45] <+LooglePlatinum> i wanna say but i cant spoil
[5:21:58] <CursedNobleman> hes gonna need a hint for this one LUL
[5:22:13] <+shaidot> memorize
[5:22:18] <+Spacemarine501> this one is tough
[5:22:25] <sosuke5> not exactly
[5:22:34] <haydenthygreat> its something involving camra angle
[5:22:38] <baronvonkame> wait is it acyually the angle
[5:22:41] <%Arancet> dont get a game over, or its back to the save point...
[5:22:47] <haydenthygreat> yes
[5:22:54] <Johnmaddened> so anyway I started blasting vineSchut vargTrash
[5:22:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:23:03] <baronvonkame> because of it blocking the sky outside?
[5:23:07] <%SirFancySwank> need to make a new bullet
[5:23:10] <+LordSDB> Oh fuck I forgot, you'd have to go back to the save point NotLikeThis
[5:23:23] <sosuke5> Hajime talking to himself at the end is your best hint.
[5:24:05] <+LooglePlatinum> copy a word maybe
[5:24:10] <+shaidot> I really wanna give it away, your pretty cold so far
[5:24:30] <haydenthygreat> Should I say the answer
[5:24:32] <SoFarFetched> Yeah I forgot about that a lot
[5:24:40] <jessegorilla> oh damn that's right you can yoink
[5:24:41] <Samex_Comex> No spoilers!
[5:24:49] <Jjaz_R> lol
[5:24:57] <haydenthygreat> alright I don't want a game over
[5:25:05] <+HawkGoggles2> I can always make out a body type. Kappa
[5:25:07] <ShockzNDrawe> ... how the fuck did I get this one my first shot when I played this. I can't remember shit
[5:25:18] <LVL1_Scumbag> Evil Mikan is kinda hot
[5:25:21] <SoFarFetched> thats cause you were ignoring the peanut gallery shockz
[5:25:56] <$Charlie99993> There's something about psycho bitches...
[5:25:57] <SuperVaderMan> Hajime just bails to go take a piss
[5:25:59] <+Promessa_EX> it's because the answers make sense
[5:26:00] <ShockzNDrawe> I tended to just sort of accept that whatever the characters most recently said was true so I'd just ignore shit
[5:26:07] <wolfen091> !raffle
[5:26:08] <dunkledubs> i think usually when your partner makes s contradictory point its meant to be used as the bullet point
[5:26:30] <%Arancet> doo doo dooo~
[5:26:40] <+LooglePlatinum> doo dee doo~
[5:26:42] <dunkledubs> the partner in this games case would be chiaki
[5:27:06] <sosuke5> !raffle
[5:27:11] <baronvonkame> chiaki or kirigiri?
[5:27:24] <+BloomingVillain> Gundham
[5:27:25] <ShockzNDrawe> okay I just looked it up yeah
[5:27:30] <CursedNobleman> V3s duo is the best
[5:27:30] <ShockzNDrawe> It makes more sense in context
[5:28:15] <SoFarFetched> I kinda remember how to answer this one.
[5:28:25] <CrimsonFox777> The hospital?
[5:28:39] <SuperVaderMan> is she wearing akane's smelly gown
[5:28:40] <blerrger19> Ar the shoes the same as in the picture?
[5:28:46] <CursedNobleman> im too mentally lazy to figure this one out. i always cheat LUL
[5:28:47] <Thewoodentree> Has anyone talked about why it doesnt make sense that someone commiting suicide would put abag on their head for no reason?
[5:29:01] <ShockzNDrawe> Plague, you've got tunnel vison rn. Make sure you check what every character is saying to you before making your decision.
[5:29:15] <+BloomingVillain> All of the evidence in the case is based around a video being made to show one person
[5:29:20] <TIME_PUNCHER> what candles is she even talking about
[5:29:24] <Samex_Comex> you think you would see the wraps on her left leg?
[5:29:33] <+clausover> killers mistake?
[5:29:34] <+shaidot> @TIME_PUNCHER bingo
[5:29:44] <dunkledubs> did hajime ever talk about the camera angle?
[5:29:49] <SoFarFetched> yeah you were kinda close Plague.
[5:30:00] <SoFarFetched> as long as chat isnt just blurting out answers.
[5:30:07] <terminusterminal> Maybe get some seconds back
[5:30:15] <blerrger19> The angle!
[5:30:22] <TIME_PUNCHER> i have no idea whats happening
[5:30:25] <blerrger19> What's being covered by this angle?
[5:30:45] <+Promessa_EX> hm it's yellow
[5:30:47] <dunkledubs> i wonder if everyone in the game completely forgot that hiyoko died at this point
[5:30:52] <SoFarFetched> You were on the right track earlier.
[5:30:58] <wolfen091> is it bag as you can't see print on ut
[5:31:06] <ShockzNDrawe> im trying to hint without flat out saying it but yeah it's one of those things where the game excepts you to be on the same page on what you're supposed to do here
[5:31:08] <$Charlie99993> Yeah, you can only copy yellow things
[5:31:12] <baronvonkame> is it the candle actually?
[5:31:21] <mef442> maybe absorb killers mistake?
[5:31:27] <+BloomingVillain> Reverse it
[5:31:43] <SoFarFetched> well if you hit "killers mistake" isn't that you're proving the killer didn't make a mistake?
[5:31:47] <$Charlie99993> @PlagueOfGripes Yellow means you're rejecting it if it hits by the way
[5:31:58] <CursedNobleman> eli is into murder pillow talk confirmed LUL
[5:32:00] <ShockzNDrawe> Well Mikan isn't the only one whos text you can copy here
[5:32:07] <@Nightbot> @LooglePlatinum -> Nightbot one, bad guys zero. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[5:32:16] <0rond> what is this archetype called? kuu-dere?
[5:32:23] <CursedNobleman> yandere
[5:32:25] <SoFarFetched> yandere
[5:32:28] <dunkledubs> maybe people would have liked mikan more if she talked like this normally
[5:32:32] <SoFarFetched> kuudere is "cool"
[5:32:36] <+withguac> Condescending cold and calm?
[5:32:39] <fridayfuntime> slow it down and absorb
[5:32:41] <Thewoodentree> implying the trick of the candlelight distorted the image?
[5:32:43] <SoFarFetched> like Rei Ayanami is kuudere I believe.
[5:32:46] <+BloomingVillain> Yes
[5:32:47] <DooWopShaBop> yes
[5:32:50] <+Spacemarine501> shoot purple?
[5:32:51] <baronvonkame> you have to contradcit mikan so yes
[5:32:51] <+LooglePlatinum> indeed yes
[5:32:52] <terminusterminal> Probably wants you to absorb the mistake and fire it where
[5:32:53] <franctastic_> YES
[5:32:59] <PinkCatHime> she's yan, not necessarily yandere, cause there isn't any dere there
[5:33:03] <ShockzNDrawe> you have to point out what is the mistake so yeah
[5:33:03] <fridayfuntime> purple is nothing
[5:33:04] <blerrger19> That's some timey whimey bullshit
[5:33:06] <ShockzNDrawe> I know
[5:33:09] <franctastic_> well
[5:33:10] <ShockzNDrawe> it's dumb
[5:33:12] <ShockzNDrawe> yes
[5:33:14] <dunkledubs> god this trial sucks
[5:33:15] <CursedNobleman> yep
[5:33:16] <0rond> but she hasn't actually showed any yandere tendencies yet, I mean how she speaks slowly and monotony until the end
[5:33:25] <SoFarFetched> well you see a bit more of the yandere,in the "dates" with her
[5:33:26] <brizzi_barks_in_the_chat> this is danganronpa
[5:33:28] <%Arancet> and yet
[5:33:32] <Samex_Comex> double mistake?
[5:33:33] <ShockzNDrawe> No you're showing them the evidence
[5:33:33] <+shaidot> yes but thematically you're contradicting mikan
[5:33:33] <$Charlie99993> To destroy yellow text with a bullet is to refute it, you don't want to refute killer's mistake
[5:33:34] <fridayfuntime> they are orange
[5:33:37] <ducellion> that so vague
[5:33:41] <+BloomingVillain> It IS a mistake
[5:33:42] <ShockzNDrawe> the evidence isn't the mistake
[5:33:46] <franctastic_> we truly are the danganronpa
[5:33:55] <+LooglePlatinum> words fill bullets yes
[5:33:55] <baronvonkame> you're refuting mikan with the premisde I guess?
[5:33:57] <%SirFancySwank> your pointing out which of her claims is the wrong one
[5:33:58] <ShockzNDrawe> You're pointing out what part of her argument IS the mistake
[5:33:59] <Johnmaddened> this "absorb other arguments" mechanic is really hard to follow
[5:34:00] <Thewoodentree> Your i honor i refuted his life  with my gun
[5:34:01] <0rond> mikan says "you can't tell from any of these things" and you say to her "you can tell from this"
[5:34:10] <mef442> i think its "yes thats the mistake" since she actually is trying to say this proves it wasnt her
[5:34:11] <terminusterminal> One minute 20 seconds
[5:34:13] <blerrger19> No no no no you have to absorb "truth" into your truth bullet to make it extra truthy
[5:34:16] <fridayfuntime> I don't really remember
[5:34:29] <radioactiveflan> Oh boy this part
[5:34:32] <ShockzNDrawe> remember if you buy one, you get another bag free
[5:34:32] <+BloomingVillain> Because info they couldnt know is CONTRADICTORY
[5:34:54] <$Charlie99993> Yeah, what can't be known here
[5:35:11] <haydenthygreat> YASSSSS
[5:35:16] <$Charlie99993> Thank god
[5:35:21] <dunkledubs> thank god no game over
[5:35:22] <franctastic_> PogChamp
[5:35:30] <haydenthygreat> its over boys
[5:35:35] <%lettersofsky> why would anyone but the killer know about the camera angle?
[5:35:38] <ShockzNDrawe> Like I said, the rest of the trials are better than this
[5:35:41] <$Charlie99993> She's commenting on the camera angle he never described
[5:35:46] <nerdypanda> ^
[5:35:52] <ShockzNDrawe> 4 is a bit rough in places but 5 is my favorite in the series
[5:35:58] <baronvonkame> mmm old man panties
[5:36:04] <calzonewithextracheese> but you could just say she assumed? this isnt proof
[5:36:05] <+RealThiele> I LIKE ANGLES
[5:36:06] <%Arancet> well, garland might
[5:36:08] <SoFarFetched> "oops I said the quiet part loud and the loud part quiet"
[5:36:19] <$Charlie99993> "There's no way you could have seen me with that camera angle I set up"
[5:36:25] <franctastic_> man cant wait for ultra despair girls
[5:36:39] <calzonewithextracheese> this is so flimsy
[5:36:41] <brizzi_barks_in_the_chat> she didnt describe anything in the shot
[5:36:45] <fridayfuntime> she never saw the video
[5:36:45] <baronvonkame> so why would she bother tossing out that idea btw?
[5:36:45] <haydenthygreat> how could you assume there was an angle?????!!!!
[5:36:53] <ShockzNDrawe> because she knew WHAT ANGLE the camera was at Plague
[5:36:54] <BurlyBeef> LUL
[5:36:54] <$Charlie99993> Ultra Despair Girls is pretty good
[5:36:55] <0rond> but she wouldn't know that it would be a hard angle to tell from
[5:36:59] <+shaidot> yeah but the one mikan used was special
[5:36:59] <fridayfuntime> she keeps screaming
[5:37:10] <blerrger19> Particular angle carefully used to hide the body type
[5:37:13] <dunkledubs> this is probably the worst trial in the trilogy
[5:37:13] <+shaidot> UDG is bad
[5:37:15] <calzonewithextracheese> are yall saying that you dont have camera angles when using a camera lmao
[5:37:18] <fridayfuntime> maybe if she stopped screaming at every accusation
[5:37:21] <Thewoodentree> Yeah but by implying that the camera angle COULDNT prove it was her, she let it out that she also saw the video
[5:37:23] <TheMoenia> at least the big titty gymnast girlfriend is still alive
[5:37:29] <NashvilleSBA> she didn't even describe the angle lmao
[5:37:31] <ducellion> celeste is too predictable
[5:37:32] <Whygod21> huh
[5:37:33] <fridayfuntime> huh
[5:37:34] <blerrger19> But any other detail about the video is just as valid
[5:37:39] <SoFarFetched> RELEASE THE BEES
[5:37:41] <franctastic_> I liked the main characters dynamic in UDG
[5:37:43] <$Charlie99993> @shaidot Nope!
[5:37:45] <calzonewithextracheese> yeah you guys are reaching she didnt even describe the angle
[5:37:56] <+admiral_of_crunch> Her... rattling things off implicates her focus in defending herself, I guess... That she was confident (or not) enough to bring it up... it's tenuous.
[5:38:01] <hazzy_o7> I do like Mikan's shenanigans this trial though
[5:38:06] <fridayfuntime> Im-paw-sible
[5:38:17] <+admiral_of_crunch> Sure is lucky she broke down when you mentioned it, eh?
[5:38:18] <0rond> how is horny boy soda not turned on by THIS of all things?
[5:38:19] <CursedNobleman> gaslighting! PogChamp
[5:38:19] <SoFarFetched> what do you mean "weirder by the minute" all you guys are weird
[5:38:19] <+shaidot> Danganronpa zero is better
[5:38:20] <Thewoodentree> I dare a murder suspect to talk like this during a trial
[5:38:28] <+xiccy> I think the point they're trying to make is that Mikan was talking about a specific angle when Hajime never said anything about which angle he saw the killer from. The problem is they never actually specify which angle so...
[5:38:29] <dunkledubs> this is dumb
[5:38:31] <+SuspiciousJosh> oooooh
[5:38:33] <SuperVaderMan> Again, they could just vote to kill her right now. They don't have to prove anything more.
[5:38:38] <+SuspiciousJosh> i get it
[5:38:43] <+SuspiciousJosh> The Movie theather
[5:38:50] <Thewoodentree> movie theater execution hoods huh?
[5:38:53] <TIME_PUNCHER> what the fuck is she talking about
[5:38:53] <warmnoid> have to pad this out
[5:39:10] <+admiral_of_crunch> Yeah but what if there is A TWIST?
[5:39:21] <fridayfuntime> she kept screaming at every single accusation so no matter what she says she's already proved herself guilty
[5:39:38] <calzonewithextracheese> ???? the fact that she knows what is in the video means she is guilty this is dumb
[5:39:39] <+Ashboldt> and she's just ironing in the video knowledge
[5:39:43] <dunkledubs> it would be really funny if the characaters just vote her in the middle of this speach
[5:39:55] <franctastic_> LUL
[5:40:06] <+admiral_of_crunch> She wants to throw in a last second alibi. Because gameplay...
[5:40:06] <hazzy_o7> Ok I forgive you, will you admit it now? LUL
[5:40:13] <+Promessa_EX> no ones claiming it's a  good defense
[5:40:13] <ShockzNDrawe> no shut up tho this proves everything
[5:40:18] <fridayfuntime> only hajime saw the video
[5:40:21] <+MisterRockett> Danganronpa can bounce back and forth between "Whodunit" and "How'dthedoit". Even after you've figured out who did it cornering them completely is still valuable.
[5:40:23] <+LooglePlatinum> last desperation, also everyone needs to vote so need killer to confess
[5:40:25] <Thewoodentree> Did he really call her out for desperatly trying to not get executed
[5:40:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> You need to TRUTH everything. Reveal the truth, therefore SOLVE THIS nonsense.
[5:40:40] <+BloomingVillain> I feel like there's major differences in japanese
[5:40:45] <0rond> serious, confident, increasingly psychotic Mikan is way too sexy and i'm upset Soda isn't reacting
[5:40:46] <fridayfuntime> I like this minigame
[5:40:55] <+LooglePlatinum> i love the beats in final battle
[5:40:58] <calzonewithextracheese> why arent they voting on her already
[5:41:05] <+Promessa_EX> just remember to put the 4 word phrase together
[5:41:09] <ShockzNDrawe> Yeah Danganronpa 2 is mistransleated in weird fucking areas on steam
[5:41:10] <dunkledubs> in the third game ts worse
[5:41:15] <SoFarFetched> BONE ON THE MEAT/MEAT ON THE BONE
[5:41:20] <%StridentSong> Yea, DR2 is riddled with translation errors
[5:41:29] <terminusterminal> w-what?
[5:41:29] <+RealThiele> love those flat jpegs
[5:41:35] <SuperVaderMan> Just press the diamond key 4Head
[5:41:40] <fridayfuntime> the button prompts are better on pc oddly enough
[5:41:46] <+Promessa_EX> MORE BAG THAN ONE
[5:41:46] <ShockzNDrawe> I need to know, did plague also fuck up the bone on the meat/ meat on the bone thing
[5:41:51] <hazzy_o7> They screwed up prompts on 3 too, but they did fix it eventually.
[5:41:53] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[5:41:53] <+LooglePlatinum> steam controller is wierd cause not ps
[5:41:54] <0rond> it was like that in the first one too
[5:42:15] <fridayfuntime> my steam controller broke a few weeks ago
[5:42:25] <fridayfuntime> I don't think you hold x
[5:42:28] <baronvonkame> god we still have rohan'd this case yet either have we
[5:42:45] <CrimsonFox777> Not just impossible for her to commit, but for ANYONE to commit.
[5:42:46] <fridayfuntime> yeah she lost it years ago
[5:42:47] <+BloomingVillain> Japanese game design vs western
[5:43:05] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:43:09] <Maids4lyfe> just like kiryu
[5:43:11] <Thewoodentree> what
[5:43:12] <+admiral_of_crunch> Hotter as she breaks down further, even.
[5:43:33] <$Rezca> this really is making it hotter
[5:43:33] <+Promessa_EX> you release on the beat
[5:43:42] <fridayfuntime> just spam fever
[5:43:55] <Samex_Comex> Party!
[5:44:09] <warmnoid> god i hate that part so much

[5:44:47] <franctastic_> I hate these
[5:44:47] <+Spacemarine501> on the meat bone
[5:44:48] <Thewoodentree> bogus lies
[5:44:49] <franctastic_> yeah
[5:44:49] <dunkledubs> imagine if fever didnt exist
[5:44:51] <Jjaz_R> This is awful
[5:44:52] <ShockzNDrawe> you buy one you get the second free
[5:44:52] <+BloomingVillain> Japanese language distinction

[5:45:09] <+admiral_of_crunch> Fuckin' localization, I swear
[5:45:10] <hazzy_o7> Can really feel the localization on these  LUL
[5:45:12] <terminusterminal> I think bonus theatre prize works to communicate the point too
[5:45:15] <Thewoodentree> One B Team the on
[5:45:15] <sopdog21> Beat on the mone
[5:45:20] <+RealThiele> ded
[5:45:24] <blerrger19> @CrimsonFox777 Huh???
[5:45:25] <fridayfuntime> Rip
[5:45:27] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> don't dead open inside
[5:45:29] <ShockzNDrawe> idk I didn't have problems with any of this maybe I'm just stupid and my brain is ruined by anime
[5:45:32] <+shaidot> V3 is the best I promise
[5:45:33] <fridayfuntime> this case isn't good
[5:45:35] <+FxyDEV> its all up from here!
[5:45:36] <Johnmaddened> it's more of the stuff near then end
[5:45:37] <franctastic_> it gets better AT THE END
[5:45:39] <Maids4lyfe> Chiaki is why
[5:45:40] <%StridentSong> 2 has better characters, 1 had better gameplay
[5:45:41] <CursedNobleman> more likeable cast? and case 5 is great
[5:45:42] <fridayfuntime> V3 is better
[5:45:44] <+MisterRockett> V3 is the best one
[5:45:46] <+FxyDEV> V3 is goat
[5:45:46] <+Spacemarine501> characters
[5:45:47] <%Arancet> V3 is a weird mix
[5:45:50] <+admiral_of_crunch> I swear it gets better from here on
[5:45:51] <dunkledubs> v3 is way better
[5:45:51] <comedeity> I like v3
[5:45:52] <NashvilleSBA> V3 is the best imo
[5:45:53] <+FxyDEV> people with no taste hate 3
[5:45:53] <BlueLunecy> V3 is great but divisive
[5:45:54] <blerrger19> @CursedNobleman Oh you mean hentai
[5:45:55] <%StridentSong> V3 has some of the best gameplay, and the worst story
[5:45:55] <+LooglePlatinum> V3 worst
[5:45:57] <baronvonkame> v3 isn't as bad if you're high on copium like I am
[5:46:00] <haydenthygreat> you haven't seen all the game though
[5:46:00] <SpiritOfThuggery> V3 is easily the best
[5:46:01] <+Spacemarine501> v3 best
[5:46:02] <Johnmaddened> v3 is certainly something
[5:46:03] <fridayfuntime> V3 is good but has a controversial ending
[5:46:05] <CursedNobleman> V3s overall plot does... things...
[5:46:06] <Maids4lyfe> it's all trash
[5:46:08] <+withguac> V3 was a troll of fans
[5:46:09] <TheMoenia> obviously ultra despair girls is best
[5:46:09] <+lolKnives> v3 is stylish at least
[5:46:09] <+Damie904> v3 has the worst story. Anyone who tells you it's good are crazy.
[5:46:12] <TheAntiNihilist> 2 will explain everything. but 1 explained very little
[5:46:14] <sosuke5> I assume people hate the V3 ending.
[5:46:16] <+shaidot> I love V3's ending
[5:46:22] <PinkCatHime> v3 has scrum at least and scrum has sick music
[5:46:22] <NashvilleSBA> V3 is love it or hate it
[5:46:23] <+FxyDEV> V3 has the best theme
[5:46:27] <CrimsonFox777> @blerrger19 She's suffered mental and physical abuse her whole life and has low self-esteem and some serious mental issues.
[5:46:29] <franctastic_> maybe by 3 they meant Ultra Despair Girls
[5:46:31] <+shaidot> kinda
[5:46:32] <fridayfuntime> you either love or hate v3
[5:46:34] <NashvilleSBA> but love it is the right position
[5:46:36] <dunkledubs> the fandom doesnt care for v3
[5:46:43] <fridayfuntime> I love v3
[5:46:48] <ShockzNDrawe> mean 3 and v3 are two very different things
[5:46:50] <dunkledubs> for the most part
[5:46:50] <+admiral_of_crunch> 2 has lategame cases that blow this nonsense out of the water
[5:46:55] <+Promessa_EX> enjoying things is still lame
[5:46:57] <CursedNobleman> V3s cast is generally poor.
[5:46:59] <+BloomingVillain> The fandom can fuck off
[5:46:59] <baronvonkame> it honestly took me some time to get over my playthrough
[5:46:59] <fridayfuntime> no more heroes reference
[5:47:06] <terminusterminal> Believe in the MURDER
[5:47:07] <+Ashboldt> what
[5:47:09] <$Rezca> believe that you lied to me
[5:47:12] <comedeity> lol
[5:47:14] <+RealThiele> believe in murder
[5:47:14] <CrimsonFox777> TIME TO MAKE A COMIC
[5:47:21] <+admiral_of_crunch> I FACE UP
[5:47:21] <dunkledubs> oh boy
[5:47:22] <Johnmaddened> you'll learn more after this
[5:47:22] <ShockzNDrawe> You'll find out soon
[5:47:25] <+Promessa_EX> finish the game
[5:47:26] <+LooglePlatinum> lol beliv3 in this concept
[5:47:26] <dunkledubs> you think that for now
[5:47:26] <%StridentSong> There's DR1, DR2, DR3 (the animes that wrap up 1 and 2's stories), DR:UDG and DR V3. DR3 has a decent story, but the format to watch it is stupid.
[5:47:26] <+zsDirtyHarry> Gonna be honest the Swim suit murder weapon thing was infuriatingly stupid
[5:47:26] <%SirFancySwank> nope
[5:47:27] <fridayfuntime> she's scizo
[5:47:29] <sopdog21> I hope plague watches the anime
[5:47:32] <SuperVaderMan> "I demand you confess" says man in Japanese court
[5:47:33] <+arcielardor> it's worse
[5:47:44] <Samex_Comex> I guess she could not take being called pig barf anymore
[5:47:44] <+shaidot> I feel like how much you like V3 is proportional to how critical you were of the other games
[5:48:03] <+admiral_of_crunch> Oh I hope she jerked it
[5:48:11] <+admiral_of_crunch> Ew
[5:48:14] <fridayfuntime> wallpaper
[5:48:23] <+zsDirtyHarry> I think these games work best if you turn your brain off and just enjoy the ride
[5:48:31] <fridayfuntime> wallpaper on the first one
[5:48:32] <+Promessa_EX> i'm calling plague is absolutely done with the series on v2's conclusion. he will totally hate every aspect of the ending
[5:48:36] <NintendoNinja64> In the anime of danganronpa, it shows how she became crazy
[5:48:38] <franctastic_> I just remember V3's first case being 3 HOURS LONG and I was so tired that I almost didn't care about who the culprit was
[5:49:17] <SoFarFetched> LUL you did that earlier
[5:49:35] <+MisterRockett> @Promessa_EX Haha yeah. I love how decisive that ending is.
[5:49:57] <+admiral_of_crunch> These games want you to turn off specific parts of your brain, and keep the others running, because these cases get 70-90% of the way to being solid and then things just get stupid.
[5:50:02] <CursedNobleman> i hate it when meta endings jack off over how clever they are
[5:50:13] <NashvilleSBA> the reason that i think dr2 and V3 are better than dr1 is that the last two have much clearer and stronger themes by the end
[5:50:59] <+zsDirtyHarry> Yeah tell em Nero
[5:51:04] <+MisterRockett> @CursedNobleman The meta ending is in service to the overall theme. The theme of hope doesn't work if we're constantly throwing teenagers into a grinder.
[5:51:09] <baronvonkame> Hajime is Joseph Smith confirmed
[5:51:11] <CursedNobleman> wait, hajime is nero?
[5:51:17] <franctastic_> Johnny Young Bosch doing his Johnny Young Bosch, I love him
[5:51:21] <+zsDirtyHarry> Yup same voice actor
[5:51:22] <CursedNobleman> mikan is voiced by kyrie
[5:51:24] <franctastic_> yup he is
[5:52:24] <franctastic_> that's pretty much the reason why I like Hajime, he's voiced by my favorite VA
[5:52:36] <CursedNobleman> hajime doesnt sound like steve blum LUL
[5:52:55] <+MisterRockett> Something important to remember about these is that the protagonist CAN get some minute details wrong because it's just their approximation of what happened.
[5:53:12] <+BloomingVillain> Nothing in it ever stated you needed mechanical expertise to operate a camera
[5:53:29] <SuperVaderMan> Hajime still being shitty for not trying to help
[5:53:37] <+MisterRockett> He'd need help getting the body down.
[5:53:55] <Phob05> well when you say it like that it sounds incredibly stupid
[5:53:56] <terminusterminal> A button lowers the railing so I don't think he'd need help with that
[5:54:17] <SoFarFetched> she was shoved to the side
[5:54:21] <+MisterRockett> Ah forgot about that. Then yeah he shoulda tried getting it down
[5:54:21] <SoFarFetched> in a sense
[5:54:26] <haydenthygreat> is there even a murder weapon for hiyoko
[5:54:30] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[5:54:30] <SoFarFetched> cause they were more focused on the camera thing
[5:54:42] <warmnoid> they barely talk about hiyoko in the case
[5:54:54] <+admiral_of_crunch> I forgot about the details of this case. I think I just cruise controlled through this one.
[5:54:56] <+BloomingVillain> This case is rewrite hell
[5:54:58] <+xerioes> they never explained when,how,and where hiyoko died
[5:55:00] <dunkledubs> they really just kinda rushed through hiyokos murder
[5:55:02] <+vanareus> the streams still on? dope
[5:55:05] <+Spacemarine501> dead body tends to draw attention
[5:55:15] <TheAntiNihilist> lol hell yeah. LIKE AN AMERICAN
[5:55:21] <+Gameroftime12> They just really wanted to have two deaths LUL
[5:55:28] <SuperVaderMan> They did the ancient goblin child dirty
[5:55:30] <+MisterRockett> The worst thing about Case 3 cases is that it's always 2 murders and one of them always feels kind of shafted.
[5:55:43] <haydenthygreat> exactly
[5:55:50] <+Promessa_EX> what's the point in doing puzzles to get out of escape rooms in 999
[5:55:51] <Thewoodentree> Anything is possible in anime
[5:56:01] <%StridentSong> Walking the Earth with Jeezus himself
[5:56:05] <+Promessa_EX> just bash your way out with a sledgehammer
[5:56:08] <%StridentSong> 2000 years old
[5:56:12] <TechnicalCultist> "disassembled" by stomping its shit
[5:56:12] <+MisterRockett> 1 probably did the best job of making them kinda sorta even but even that was mostly the Hifume Murder Mystery.
[5:56:13] <ShockzNDrawe> you mean the anime murder game with a robotic bear that plunge the world into an apocalypses is UNREALISTIC?!?
[5:56:19] <+akumakid13> if it means anything everyone points to this cause being the worse cause in the franchise
[5:56:45] <+akumakid13> case*
[5:56:49] <SoFarFetched> Look this game is already unrealistic,there's a Vita in there.
[5:56:56] <+MisterRockett> @akumakid13 You get double wammy'd with a bad case and losing the two best characters of the game.
[5:57:02] <terminusterminal> Hiyoko stumbled on the perfect time, when Mikan was strangling Ibuki instead of just telling her to hang herself and also while Mikan had a knife on her and lots of duct tape on hand too
[5:57:13] <+admiral_of_crunch> Don't forget, Danganronpa exists in an anime world with unclear mechanics. The killer could've Looney Tune-ed through the entire murder with Bugs Bunny precision.
[5:57:16] <0rond> I think this trial is the worst in 2
[5:57:34] <0rond> (no saying this based on this stream, I played all of 2)
[5:57:41] <NashvilleSBA> i think the consensus is that the third case is the worst in each
[5:57:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> If only
[5:57:48] <$Donutjulio> Ya the fact that you can kinda go everywhere instantly screws with any perception of time you can have
[5:57:54] <%SirFancySwank> not really
[5:57:54] <+BloomingVillain> He was supposed to
[5:58:11] <+MisterRockett> @admiral_of_crunch I would actually be more into murder mystery with Looney Tune physics instead of trying to make thing seems kind of plausible. Although I guess I'd still want it to be plausible within the world of Looney Tunes physics.
[5:58:13] <baronvonkame> tbh the entire series is predicated upon wunderkind children with godlike abilities, I just ignore it
[5:58:14] <TechnicalCultist> this MASTER SCHEME
[5:58:26] <Thewoodentree> Why is she in a JoJo pose
[5:58:28] <dunkledubs> mikan did all this in the time it took for hajime to run from one place and back AND made it to the hospital in time before Fuyohiko could have seen her running around
[5:58:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> Hot
[5:58:36] <hazzy_o7> Look at her, she can't have done it.
[5:58:54] <terminusterminal> If Hiyoko had showed up at any other time this plan would've been blown skyhigh.
[5:58:55] <Thewoodentree> soooo....what if she just denies it?
[5:58:55] <+MisterRockett> Oh god she has the worst execution too now that I remember.
[5:59:07] <+LooglePlatinum> lets all have a good laugh
[5:59:10] <+BloomingVillain> Not yet
[5:59:12] <+admiral_of_crunch> Do a 360, camera
[5:59:14] <baronvonkame> anxiety attack
[5:59:20] <+LooglePlatinum> there you go
[5:59:22] <+MisterRockett> @Thewoodentree It's due to vote so it doesn't actually matter.
[5:59:25] <SuperVaderMan> despair despair despair
[5:59:25] <+admiral_of_crunch> Dis pear, dude
[5:59:28] <Thewoodentree> ^o^
[5:59:37] <+Spacemarine501> Dispair!!!
[5:59:40] <haydenthygreat> let's laugh at how bad this trial was
[5:59:40] <Lord_Siking> dis pair of nutz
[5:59:43] <+HawkGoggles2> Plot time i guess
[5:59:43] <terminusterminal> There is no Japanese word for "pacing" is there?
[5:59:46] <franctastic_> SeemsGood
[5:59:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> She's a plant! Make a power plant out of her!
[5:59:48] <blerrger19> Uh, I think these kids got "despair" confused with a different emotion
[5:59:48] <Thewoodentree> @MisterRockett ah, thanks for the clarification
[6:00:02] <ShockzNDrawe> Plague is disappointed he did so WELL
[6:00:04] <Samex_Comex> B for boner
[6:00:05] <+admiral_of_crunch> B for bith
[6:00:06] <ducellion> how about you despair some bitches
[6:00:13] <Thewoodentree> B for blyat
[6:00:25] <+LooglePlatinum> indeed she is
[6:00:27] <+jambofatherandsongaming> Nooooo my waifus gonna get execution
[6:00:38] <+Spacemarine501> B for Dispair
[6:00:39] <+Who_lio42> B for buSploosh
[6:00:53] <+LooglePlatinum> oh Eli have you seen her alt costume?
[6:00:53] <$Donutjulio> You gonna play despair girls?
[6:00:55] <dunkledubs> nah thats for sure the orst one
[6:00:55] <NashvilleSBA> i don't think any is as bad as this from here on out
[6:01:06] <+MisterRockett> The next time you'll get a case even close to this bad is Trail 3 of V3 cause these are always the worst ones.
[6:01:11] <+admiral_of_crunch> This is a low point. The rest of this game is high points iirc, which I hope I do.
[6:01:12] <+BloomingVillain> Necromaru?
[6:01:19] <CursedNobleman> 'the trials are the worst part of these games' wow. that never occurred to me.
[6:01:25] <paltar4> Can you accuse the wrong person in this game or do you get railroaded
[6:01:35] <+MisterRockett> @paltar4 railroad
[6:01:44] <star_mod> Don't listen to people. @PlagueOfGripes
[6:01:47] <+Who_lio42> yeah instant game over if you choose wrong
[6:01:48] <SoFarFetched> the Danganronpa series is very divisive,people either say its really good or its really bad.
[6:01:50] <+BloomingVillain> It gets better "for us"
[6:01:53] <ShockzNDrawe> well
[6:01:53] <Thewoodentree> for a cover story?
[6:01:58] <+LooglePlatinum> because she was a nurse
[6:02:01] <ShockzNDrawe> maybe keep goin
[6:02:01] <%theloganbrand> So, Ace Attorney playthrough after this?
[6:02:03] <+MisterRockett> It's explained, hilariously enough.
[6:02:08] <+Spacemarine501> nurse instincts
[6:02:14] <dunkledubs> it doesnt make sense
[6:02:14] <SoFarFetched> Yeah theres a reason
[6:02:18] <+admiral_of_crunch> I dunno horny maybe
[6:02:22] <$Charlie99993> She's the nurse, it would be weird if she doesn't help them
[6:02:22] <TheMoenia> just press a pillow on his head
[6:02:28] <mef442> i like that its nagato
[6:02:34] <Thewoodentree> or just injects him with an empty syringe
[6:02:35] <%Sweetangy021> That makes too much sense
[6:02:40] <TIME_PUNCHER> something something mercy euthanasia
[6:02:41] <0rond> but like, why would she kill nagito? and how would you find evidence and gamify it?
[6:02:51] <%Arancet> yeah, thered have to be a trial
[6:02:57] <+LooglePlatinum> wait, plot coming in fast
[6:02:57] <0rond> her motives aren't really as simple as "I wanted to kill them"
[6:02:57] <terminusterminal> Just drop a screwdriver on the floor
[6:02:58] <%SirFancySwank> would that really count, she has no reason save them in the first
[6:03:03] <CrimsonFox777> There'd still have to be a trial and everything and she'd be the obvious culprit.
[6:03:11] <Thewoodentree> ah the ocean....hider of secrets
[6:03:18] <CrimsonFox777> No littering!
[6:03:24] <+admiral_of_crunch> She's have to yell at him really really loud to make his ears hurt, pushing him over the edge.
[6:03:24] <+shaidot> DESPAIR
[6:03:24] <+MisterRockett> There's an answer
[6:03:37] <+MisterRockett> Hmmmmm
[6:03:37] <+LooglePlatinum> despair happen
[6:03:38] <+admiral_of_crunch> Because horny?
[6:03:39] <SuperVaderMan> yeah, uh, what about motive
[6:03:39] <mef442> ding ding ding
[6:03:45] <+Spacemarine501> Dispair
[6:03:46] <Thewoodentree> Dont they have to kill for some reason, i dont know the plot very well
[6:03:55] <paltar4> She’s a sicko
[6:04:09] <+admiral_of_crunch> Uh oh
[6:04:11] <franctastic_> Mikan had it rough ok?
[6:04:12] <reonome> i mean in a way he is
[6:04:13] <+Promessa_EX> and that's why you will hate this
[6:04:13] <%Sweetangy021> Then why does she still have it during the trial?
[6:04:16] <Phob05> yes
[6:04:21] <SoFarFetched> well he didn't "murder" them himself.
[6:04:22] <NashvilleSBA> mens rea just isn't a thing in these games lol
[6:04:38] <CrimsonFox777> @Thewoodentree They're trapped and in order to get out, they have to kill someone and get away with it.
[6:04:38] <+Promessa_EX> serious hair boner
[6:04:38] <dunkledubs> technically monokuma is responsible for all the murders
[6:04:38] <SuperVaderMan> Ah but you see, even though Monokuma is responsible, he used Mikan as a tool, and tools are responsible for murder as established in the previous trial
[6:04:41] <%theloganbrand> His hair boner
[6:04:42] <baronvonkame> i almost put my dick in crazy
[6:04:43] <+admiral_of_crunch> Monokuma's a cheater, he wouldn't care
[6:04:46] <+BloomingVillain> In a way isnt he responsible for Every murder
[6:04:54] <+MisterRockett> Man that cowlick is doing some work
[6:04:56] <+Spacemarine501> lost of fans in here
[6:05:01] <Thewoodentree> This is Saw logic, "i dont kill people, i just put them in situations where they will definetly kill someone"
[6:05:03] <franctastic_> Haha....he had a boner
[6:05:04] <Shershah_AD> im surprised i didnt already follow plague
[6:05:07] <Shershah_AD> lol
[6:05:14] <+admiral_of_crunch> Aww man this insane murderer is so hot it'll be really weird when she dies brutally.
[6:05:16] <Thewoodentree> @CrimsonFox777 thanks
[6:05:31] <+MisterRockett> @Thewoodentree Eeeeeeeh the protagonist tend to blame Monokuma before their friends for all the killing so not really.
[6:05:32] <CalderGaming> good old righty
[6:05:45] <TheAntiNihilist> his design only gets better from here
[6:05:46] <terminusterminal> Is that why he hates his left hand?
[6:05:49] <franctastic_> WELP
[6:05:50] <+LooglePlatinum> ah right hand-kun you better than lefty
[6:05:52] <dunkledubs> maybe
[6:05:55] <TIME_PUNCHER> take my strong hand, child
[6:05:57] <4213dead> So in this game, anyone can just become a cold calculating killer at any time for no real reason?
[6:06:02] <SuperVaderMan> Look don't make fun of him because he hates his baby hand
[6:06:03] <+MisterRockett> @admiral_of_crunch Yeah. "Brutally." Lets get to that execution.
[6:06:07] <+Spacemarine501> right hand is best hand
[6:06:10] <+LordSDB> He did
[6:06:18] <TurtleButter> same size but aight
[6:06:21] <baronvonkame> well
[6:06:22] <franctastic_> Left hand is best hand tho
[6:06:35] <%lettersofsky> he said he turned off the disease after the body announcement ye
[6:06:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> Ugh
[6:06:39] <+Who_lio42> Rui Komatsuzaki is the artist from what it seems
[6:06:40] <$Donutjulio> I hate Nagito so muchj
[6:06:43] <+shaidot> kibou vs zetsubou!
[6:06:53] <+Who_lio42> "now my left hand"
[6:06:53] <%SirFancySwank> he simp for hope
[6:06:54] <+Promessa_EX> it's the whole thing
[6:06:54] <SuperVaderMan> :o
[6:06:57] <+Who_lio42> it is
[6:06:58] <Phob05> You should only kill for HOPE
[6:07:05] <CrimsonFox777> Add that to the fetish list.
[6:07:09] <franctastic_> I dunno man
[6:07:11] <+Spacemarine501> mmeeeee??

[6:08:26] <TheAntiNihilist> not really actually.
[6:08:33] <star_mod> fanservice until the end
[6:08:37] <+Ashboldt> happy birthday honey, double homicide
[6:08:37] <baronvonkame> implying that'd be revealed until the 11th hr
[6:08:38] <SoFarFetched> it takes awhile
[6:08:43] <SoFarFetched> so buckle up plague
[6:08:49] <SoFarFetched> or rather go to bed
[6:08:59] <TheAntiNihilist> hmmmmm
[6:09:00] <+BloomingVillain> Being crazy is a valid reason, but only for the crazy.
[6:09:09] <+admiral_of_crunch> This game likes to slow burn all the real answers, so... no comment
[6:09:11] <+BinaryFireball> big log
[6:09:15] <Thewoodentree> damn bro......are you a virgin?
[6:09:18] <star_mod> hahaha
[6:09:52] <paltar4> Is her beloved her hand?
[6:10:02] <TheAntiNihilist> she's the only one who's sane right now...
[6:10:16] <JeedyJay> This is the porniest artsyle I've seen being used for something that isn't porn
[6:10:24] <Thewoodentree> wow
[6:10:24] <+RealThiele> oops all diseases
[6:10:29] <Johnmaddened> yep
[6:10:31] <%Arancet> hell yeah it is
[6:10:33] <+Who_lio42> Diseases all the way down
[6:10:34] <Thewoodentree> I caught forget
[6:10:36] <baronvonkame> like mr burns's body tbh
[6:10:36] <%Sweetangy021> This disease nonsense is the worst plotline
[6:10:37] <CrimsonFox777> It is trash, and I love it
[6:10:41] <TIME_PUNCHER> oh no, memory STD's
[6:10:48] <+admiral_of_crunch> The motivation is nothing you could have possibly foreseen!
[6:10:56] <ShockzNDrawe> yeah
[6:11:01] <Thewoodentree> Altzheimers is a bitch and so is she
[6:11:02] <+BloomingVillain> Yes
[6:11:09] <sosuke5> it's a mystery!
[6:11:12] <+Ashboldt> Someone needs to pull Nagito aside and be like look, she crazy, let's move on.
[6:11:33] <franctastic_> @plagueofgripes are planning on streaming the rest of the game? And for that matter, also the other games?
[6:11:41] <JeedyJay> I'm craving a Chris reponse to this.
[6:11:56] <Thewoodentree> I chose to imagine shes saying all this while being dragged to a guillotine
[6:12:01] <+admiral_of_crunch> Fuckin' Japanese filler trash writing I love it
[6:12:16] <SoFarFetched> You need to babysit Pat and Paige
[6:12:17] <amonimis> this seems way worse than dr1, at least writing-wise
[6:12:17] <franctastic_> Understandable
[6:12:27] <CursedNobleman> mmn
[6:12:28] <+vanareus> something for Woolie eh?
[6:12:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> The rest of the game *does* actually have really good cases, I swear...
[6:12:42] <wolfen091> but who would draw the furries?!
[6:13:00] <+BinaryFireball> finally the sketch of woolie as a sheep that we have all been patiently been waiting for
[6:13:05] <Thewoodentree> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuture
[6:13:05] <Johnmaddened> MIRAI
[6:13:06] <baronvonkame> fuck we;; Im outta here after the execution I need to be up

[6:13:17] <franctastic_> mirai
[6:13:26] <SoFarFetched> The Foundation?
[6:13:27] <paltar4> She’s just blabbering to delay her execution
[6:13:32] <+vanareus> future foundation
[6:13:33] <%theloganbrand> Future Foundation
[6:13:35] <Thewoodentree> the coomers
[6:13:35] <franctastic_> The future’s future future NotLikeThis
[6:13:40] <+LooglePlatinum> organization XIII?
[6:13:52] <paltar4> All the names in this game are shit
[6:13:57] <+xerioes> Future foundation, they also had spiderman in that whit costume
[6:13:57] <wolfen091> future fornication
[6:14:27] <baronvonkame> it's a copout to say but it';s light novel material
[6:14:27] <Thewoodentree> blah blah blah illuminati
[6:14:45] <Johnmaddened> vineMAYbe
[6:14:46] <Dr_Servbot> LUL
[6:14:49] <TheAntiNihilist> YES THEY DO. prepare for Kingdom Hearts 2
[6:14:55] <wolfen091> keizaLewd
[6:15:00] <Cyral_Drive> amogus
[6:15:01] <Thewoodentree> oh my god just kill her already
[6:15:15] <reonome> there's still more game you need to play!
[6:15:17] <franctastic_> The prequel anime explains how it all started
[6:15:34] <+admiral_of_crunch> The prequel anime sure is mostly disappointing...
[6:15:52] <+admiral_of_crunch> Great opening, though.
[6:15:53] <baronvonkame> anime was a good laugh
[6:15:53] <Thewoodentree> fuck you
[6:16:17] <%SirFancySwank> crazy her is real her
[6:16:41] <wolfen091> this trial has been going on for like 4 hours
[6:16:54] <+Ashboldt> more like a patch
[6:17:01] <sopdog21> At least the anime gave Mukuro some screentime
[6:17:23] <Thewoodentree> So its just The Argonauts' Ship thought experiment then
[6:17:34] <%theloganbrand> If it's all based on genetics I was ruined by my dad's balls
[6:17:45] <BlueLunecy> Science says lots of things
[6:17:54] <arkv01> ScaredyCat ScaredyCat
[6:18:00] <TIME_PUNCHER> Science is a liar. Sometimes
[6:18:16] <%SirFancySwank> ready for thr WORST execution
[6:18:20] <Lord_Siking> Studies show, most studies are not correct
[6:18:23] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's nature + nurture to me until an alien descends from the heavens and tells me how it all works.
[6:18:24] <terminusterminal> How bad could it be?
[6:18:25] <Johnmaddened> oh this one
[6:18:25] <Thewoodentree> Death by cervix fracturing
[6:18:25] <+MisterRockett> Time for this idiotic bullshit
[6:18:38] <+admiral_of_crunch> Death by hentai bad end
[6:18:43] <%Arancet> yes theseus
[6:18:44] <NashvilleSBA> yes its theseus
[6:18:48] <%lol_Last> i got gifted i just realise plagueChirei
[6:18:50] <+Spacemarine501> yes
[6:19:04] <franctastic_> Welp we had a good run mikan i guess
[6:19:07] <+MisterRockett> This execution is so dumb there's a fan theory about what it ACTUALLY is I'll share it after it's done.
[6:19:12] <JeedyJay> "But it relies on-" is always a strech
[6:19:24] <arkv01> well that analogy is bust LUL
[6:19:34] <PinkCatHime> hence why locke's socks is superior
[6:19:42] <Artista_AF> well then, who knew there was an answer for the Theseus ship thingy
[6:20:11] <arkv01> yo this sucks BibleThump
[6:20:15] <arkv01> fuck this bear
[6:20:17] <%Arancet> this case killed all the waifus
[6:20:25] <arkv01> JESAS
[6:20:27] <Thewoodentree> uhhhhh
[6:20:30] <reonome> Kreygasm
[6:20:31] <JeedyJay> S E X
[6:20:33] <Samex_Comex> rocket punch
[6:20:34] <Johnmaddened> FEEST
[6:20:41] <ShockzNDrawe> one of these days
[6:20:43] <terminusterminal> What.
[6:20:45] <CrimsonFox777> "Fuck this, I'm going to space!"
[6:20:47] <Thewoodentree> fisted to death
[6:20:48] <ShockzNDrawe> pow, straight to the moon
[6:20:49] <+MisterRockett> So the fan theory is that this execution is actually a drug induced hallucination due to lethal infection.
[6:20:54] <Artista_AF> excuse me what?
[6:20:54] <TIME_PUNCHER> fucking what
[6:21:00] <Phob05> aight
[6:21:01] <SuperVaderMan> Uh, ok
[6:21:02] <Maya_Hett> She might even survive that.
[6:21:04] <%Arancet> fisted into the sky.... yes
[6:21:05] <arkv01> I think it was a shot of SEX
[6:21:09] <franctastic_> How ironic
[6:21:09] <paltar4> She’s with the aliens now
[6:21:09] <+HawkGoggles2> Fisting I get it.
[6:21:09] <arkv01> not cool monokuma
[6:21:13] <TIME_PUNCHER> she was yeeted into the moon Team Rocket style?
[6:21:15] <reonome> sai on ji
[6:21:17] <SoFarFetched> yeah thats about right
[6:21:18] <+admiral_of_crunch> She has escaped, I guess
[6:21:18] <+Ashboldt> fisted out to the sky is a sentence I hope to never hear again
[6:21:20] <CrimsonFox777> sigh-on-gee
[6:21:21] <Lord_Siking> launched off into a better game perhaps
[6:21:24] <CalderGaming> yeah you got it
[6:21:26] <Johnmaddened> she's fisting in heaven now
[6:21:30] <+MisterRockett> I'm not so sure since she's not the first or last character to be rocketed into space but it as never as goofy as someone just riding a rocket fist.
[6:21:40] <+Spacemarine501> good old tony
[6:21:43] <+not_crabby> anticlimactic kill
[6:21:48] <JeedyJay> That's the way you center yourself, yes
[6:21:52] <+MisterRockett> It didn't even explode.
[6:21:55] <%Arancet> i think these are weird names even for japanese maybe? silly animes love giving super stupid names to characters
[6:22:17] <+admiral_of_crunch> Kinda like Sigh-own-gee
[6:22:20] <+withguac> Prozd did a vid on American names by Japanese stakes
[6:22:25] <+Promessa_EX> Carter Conner Conrad
[6:22:44] <bipen38> ever see the nes game where a Japanese developer just made up English names for a roster?
[6:22:45] <reonome> american media has permeated the global consciousness enough that western names are easy to remember for everyone
[6:22:48] <JeedyJay> Or else she's one of those fanatic characters that will break character because someone loved them once
[6:22:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:23:08] <reonome> mainly first names
[6:23:13] <+MisterRockett> It might be fair at this point to say she joined the cult of Ultimate Despair at some point due to Junko.
[6:23:15] <+IDTheftVictim> Ok what is the best brainwashed storyline, because they are kinda meh
[6:23:19] <$Donutjulio> Nagito is the actual worst character in this franchise
[6:23:20] <SoFarFetched> yeah ProZD does a lot of Voice acting you've probably seen things of him
[6:23:30] <Thewoodentree> ultimate dumbass.....got em
[6:23:46] <+admiral_of_crunch> Nagito is both the worst and the best, because he's the worst. He's my favorite part of this game.
[6:23:47] <%Arancet> nagito is just annoying
[6:23:51] <TheAntiNihilist> it's true tho
[6:23:52] <Artista_AF> yeah Nagito izs kind of a dumbass dickwad
[6:24:04] <+KellBeII> he talks a lot but he doesnt say much
[6:24:07] <JeedyJay> Danganronpa's take on Hope VS Despair is RELENTLESSLY stupid
[6:24:18] <+Promessa_EX> you keep saying things
[6:24:23] <$Donutjulio> I hate that people in the fanbase like him so much it's fucking weird
[6:24:27] <%Sweetangy021> The "Huey" is a good character this is just grating
[6:24:27] <professorno> he's funny
[6:24:37] <JeedyJay> Like - just read old Superman comics. It'll be more fun.
[6:24:38] <+admiral_of_crunch> The game tries so hard to make his input seem important but he's just around being a shit. It's hilarious.
[6:24:42] <terminusterminal> Activation phrase
[6:24:47] <ShockzNDrawe> sleeper agent
[6:24:52] <+IDTheftVictim> trigger
[6:24:54] <terminusterminal> Trigger phrase
[6:24:55] <blerrger19> Its like describing someone as having more than one "side"
[6:25:00] <vladtet909> I don't believe the writers of Dangan Ronpa actually knew what Hope or Despair is
[6:25:23] <%Arancet> you thinking of mandela effect?
[6:25:25] <CrimsonFox777> Pavlovian Conditioning?
[6:25:50] <JeedyJay> Brainwashers saying "I just revealed who they REALLY were!" is such a tacky thing, and I hate when other characters in the story believe it.
[6:26:01] <$Donutjulio> I can't believe I thought this game was well written when I first played it
[6:26:07] <$Charlie99993> Monokuma's always been a freak
[6:26:09] <+crow114> They activated her Manchurian candidate trigger phrase
[6:26:11] <Artista_AF> Safeword lunarSmug
[6:26:12] <arkv01> probably lost in translation
[6:26:14] <Thewoodentree> Did this go through Google Translate?
[6:26:22] <Samex_Comex> What if a hobo did write this
[6:26:40] <%SirFancySwank> Nisa is notoriously bad at loacalization
[6:26:46] <+admiral_of_crunch> The localization is pretty poverty. It makes the whole shebang pretty nonsensical and garbage and lovable, I find.
[6:26:51] <%Arancet> bah, i mixed up mandela effect with Manchurian Candidate, thats the one about a brainwashed assassin
[6:27:08] <Samex_Comex> He's a head in a jar, no longer able to shit
[6:27:18] <+akumakid13> does he tap out
[6:27:18] <dunkledubs> whats the chance he gives up on playing the rest of this game after this next scene
[6:27:27] <+admiral_of_crunch> And now to fall back in love with the game again.
[6:27:29] <Thewoodentree> 3 of our friends died, i cant be happy another is fine
[6:27:40] <paltar4> I am filled with Hope it can’t get any worse
[6:27:43] <arkv01> I'm salty this weeb princess is still alive while all the waifus are dead PunOko
[6:27:48] <paltar4> Maximum cope
[6:27:55] <Johnmaddened> this game gets really weird from here it's great
[6:28:01] <Thewoodentree> boob tears are the most powerful
[6:28:18] <+crow114> Man I can't wait to see the finger curl on this monkeys paw
[6:28:27] <+admiral_of_crunch> Danganronpa 2 begins here...
[6:28:46] <reonome> LUL
[6:28:48] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[6:28:55] <star_mod> LUL
[6:28:57] <+Spacemarine501> LUL
[6:28:58] <+MisterRockett> I get how it sort of needs cool down moments that take some time so it doesn't feel like you're just speeding from beat to beat. But it's padding can feel too much like padding instead of flavor text.
[6:28:59] <SuperVaderMan> Jokes are real you know
[6:29:07] <+Damie904> LUL
[6:29:11] <bipen38> PepeLaugh
[6:29:15] <%SirFancySwank> he took dragon ball z damge
[6:29:27] <arkv01> the japanese mutant regeneration factor
[6:29:34] <arkv01> everyone's a mini wolverine
[6:29:42] <dunkledubs> man...
[6:29:42] <Samex_Comex> Booyah!
[6:29:49] <ShockzNDrawe> His VA IS Franky's VA
[6:29:49] <sopdog21> If the students failed the trial, would nekomaru also be executed even if he didn't participate ?
[6:29:53] <SuperVaderMan> Suuuuupeeeeerrrrr
[6:29:57] <+MisterRockett> God Plague you need to stop making these predictions.
[6:29:58] <+admiral_of_crunch> LUL
[6:30:04] <franctastic_> Kappa

[6:30:13] <Samex_Comex> Radical beam!
[6:30:22] <dunkledubs> its almosty like the game is too predictable
[6:30:28] <SoFarFetched> its a good pose
[6:30:33] <JeedyJay> Did the SniderCut make people aware of Cyborg? Because if so - HELL YEAH
[6:30:35] <SuperVaderMan> stahp
[6:30:35] <Thewoodentree> fingers crossed for putting his brain into a monkey body
[6:30:41] <ShockzNDrawe> This is gonna be the best shit im so excited
[6:30:47] <arkv01> its her ally of justice pose before she transforms into a power ranger
[6:30:52] <paltar4> Return to monke
[6:30:59] <Thewoodentree> Hes the palm tree
[6:31:07] <franctastic_> Oh boy
[6:31:13] <+akumakid13> does he tap out
[6:31:19] <JeedyJay> More people need to know how good Cyborg is
[6:31:21] <franctastic_> Here goes
[6:31:24] <warmnoid> LUL
[6:31:30] <arkv01> yeah that looks like a mecha boot
[6:31:33] <fridayfuntime> haha robot
[6:31:33] <SoFarFetched> akane looks so stilted
[6:31:48] <arkv01> IT?
[6:31:54] <arkv01> oh jesas...
[6:32:09] <NashvilleSBA> this is the worst art style in the game
[6:32:14] <Thewoodentree> an internal back message
[6:32:14] <franctastic_> Patrick Seitz doing his Patrick Seitz voice
[6:32:23] <%StridentSong> MECHAMARU
[6:32:24] <Samex_Comex> Oh my god
[6:32:27] <CrimsonFox777> PRAISE MECHAMARU
[6:32:27] <+xerioes> now he shits actual bricks
[6:32:29] <Johnmaddened> POOP ROBOT
[6:32:30] <fridayfuntime> robot
[6:32:32] <SoFarFetched> MECHAMARU
[6:32:36] <Phob05> Mechomaru
[6:32:36] <CursedNobleman> he cant shit anymore BibleThump
[6:32:37] <ShockzNDrawe> Nekomaru and Franky from OP share the same English VA
[6:32:37] <+MisterRockett> It is STRAIGHT UP a Franky reference.
[6:32:39] <Thewoodentree> I actually love how stupid that is
[6:32:40] <franctastic_> LUL
[6:32:43] <Maya_Hett> Is that s spiral from Gurren Laggan
[6:32:44] <amonimis> LUL
[6:32:51] <fridayfuntime> it could be a jojo reference
[6:32:55] <bipen38> QUICK predict the next trial
[6:32:56] <+admiral_of_crunch> Actual sentai robot
[6:32:58] <%Sweetangy021> You predicted so much last stream
[6:33:02] <SoFarFetched> he's got the ultraman eyes
[6:33:04] <fridayfuntime> that noise
[6:33:08] <Samex_Comex> He's a Metallikat!
[6:33:08] <franctastic_> It is most likely a reference to some old mecha anime
[6:33:16] <+MisterRockett> Also you should be well aware of where this island is at this point so it's not even that insane.
[6:33:20] <franctastic_> Like OLD old mecha anime
[6:33:22] <arkv01> mad hype cause she's a mecha merd
[6:33:30] <Indigoblade> hey look it's the gantz machine
[6:33:33] <Futurecity10> No how many people are even left
[6:33:38] <arkv01> wow this really is just the gantz ball
[6:33:39] <%Sweetangy021> You actually did predict Mikan being the killer due to the disease
[6:33:54] <TheMoenia> i was about to say, what is gantz doing here
[6:33:59] <SuperVaderMan> So can robot be killed
[6:33:59] <amonimis> so how long was this chapter, like 5 hours?
[6:34:00] <%Arancet> he threw out a lot of possibilities
[6:34:04] <%SirFancySwank> the original script fotr the game had yakuza baby as the killer in ch 3
[6:34:05] <ShockzNDrawe> well it WAS because of the disease
[6:34:08] <ShockzNDrawe> but it's also stupid
[6:34:10] <Thewoodentree> Doesnt the cyborg thing mean you can pretty much justify brining anyone back from the dead?
[6:34:13] <mef442> you called shes a despair
[6:34:21] <%Sweetangy021> She remembered due to the disease
[6:34:27] <CursedNobleman> it can only get better! LUL
[6:34:34] <terminusterminal> What the hell are you talking about hajime
[6:34:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> What a low note to end on.
[6:34:37] <+MisterRockett> Everyone was originally everything. They make conceptual executions for every character in the game.
[6:34:42] <BlueLunecy> I like his drill goatee
[6:34:57] <professorno> It gets much better but I can't promise it won't still be stupid
[6:34:58] <SoFarFetched> look that T-shirt had sentimental value
[6:35:02] <+admiral_of_crunch> The bulge now lives on in our hearts
[6:35:12] <+MisterRockett> The concept for Makoto's execution is one of my favorite unused ones.
[6:35:20] <CursedNobleman> if he shat as a robot id applaud
[6:35:27] <TheMoenia> to be honest, i would love a robo body
[6:35:31] <comedeity> i like his human mouth lol
[6:35:41] <%Arancet> but being a robot is too stupid to be real
[6:35:50] <%Sweetangy021> trash can bot
[6:35:59] <professorno> 70's anime robot
[6:36:01] <Maya_Hett> His head is terrible
[6:36:01] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's the little twist that makes the nonsense work.
[6:36:01] <arkv01> I think its on purpose
[6:36:03] <Indigoblade> i wouldn't mind being a terminator
[6:36:06] <arkv01> yeah this is like astroboy lineart
[6:36:06] <sopdog21> His head looks like The World
[6:36:12] <Indigoblade> But this ain't it
[6:36:19] <+MisterRockett> The appears to be clearly more comfortable drawing anime wifus over robots.
[6:36:21] <arkv01> oh I guess she's not a mecha fan...
[6:36:28] <+MisterRockett> The artist*
[6:36:36] <%ZiggySol> So did they scope up his brain and put it into the robot?
[6:36:57] <+MisterRockett> I feel like one of the few people who actually loves Soda.
[6:37:00] <TheAntiNihilist> she's being constantly retraumatized
[6:37:20] <Johnmaddened> vineHard
[6:37:22] <CalderGaming> hard surfaces
[6:37:31] <+MisterRockett> He's like if Leon was less of a douche and stuck around.
[6:37:37] <+admiral_of_crunch> Soda screams good
[6:37:39] <%Sweetangy021> Aren't guns notoriously difficult to animate?
[6:37:50] <arkv01> no more IT
[6:37:55] <Maya_Hett> Its okay, dick can be added later
[6:37:59] <TheMoenia> i bet he has a dick attachement
[6:38:10] <+Promessa_EX> probably cranking out about 50 of these for 16 characters, x2 for our boy here
[6:38:11] <arkv01> LUL
[6:38:13] <+admiral_of_crunch> The beard is now dick
[6:38:23] <seth45er> I mean a robo body doesn't suffer from IBS is a good deal.
[6:38:31] <SuperVaderMan> Stuff happens when you're alive MrDestructoid
[6:38:52] <terminusterminal> I still don't know what his head is shaped like.
[6:39:08] <Samex_Comex> Maybe his bones shatterd?
[6:39:11] <%Sweetangy021> Then he almost split his own stomache
[6:39:17] <+MisterRockett> The characters taking battle damage throughout the game is one of the neat things about DR2.
[6:39:25] <%Arancet> and he cant do one of those now
[6:39:28] <CursedNobleman> i respect that
[6:39:31] <Maya_Hett> jesus
[6:39:45] <JeedyJay> "reality"
[6:39:46] <reonome> LUL
[6:39:49] <+admiral_of_crunch> He was hit by a robofication ray. Like in Sonic the Hedgehog
[6:39:55] <+MisterRockett> You could say this is all him processing the trama of suddenly having a new body.
[6:39:57] <SuperVaderMan> Look at that reality
[6:39:58] <arkv01> is he really still alive without his PP ScaredyCat
[6:39:58] <terminusterminal> THIS IS NOT A GaME
[6:40:01] <+admiral_of_crunch> God, I hate those lines
[6:40:08] <+Spacemarine501> monkey
[6:40:23] <franctastic_> Oh yeah reality all over me Kreygasm
[6:41:03] <+admiral_of_crunch> Brain in a jar?
[6:41:21] <+admiral_of_crunch> Brain in a jar in a computer chip?
[6:41:29] <%SirFancySwank> AI wasnt chihiru just used himself as a visual ref
[6:41:42] <ahaegotrigger> its not a good one at all
[6:41:43] <+MisterRockett> Have they not dropped the super heavy hints on where this game is taking place right now?
[6:41:43] <arkv01> hes got a few more screws loose now
[6:41:53] <TheAntiNihilist> he's VERY attracted to him now
[6:42:07] <+MisterRockett> I feel like from the beginning I was like "Oh okay the game is taking place *blank*"
[6:42:08] <Johnmaddened> "don't think too hard about it"
[6:42:23] <CalderGaming> The Shit Of Theseus
[6:42:42] <arkv01> looney tunes technology
[6:42:52] <+admiral_of_crunch> Believe it or not, this all makes sense eventually.
[6:42:54] <terminusterminal> Oh yeah, why are they living in normal ass japan if they can do this?
[6:43:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:43:04] <SuperVaderMan> ???
[6:43:20] <Samex_Comex> He has a firehose now
[6:43:21] <arkv01> no penis, he's WORTHLESS PunOko
[6:43:27] <+AMadHollow> aw shit it's plague, hope you've been well. I wish I checked earlier
[6:43:29] <+FxyDEV> many ahoge
[6:43:30] <terminusterminal> There goes the buttons
[6:43:33] <ahaegotrigger> I love her chest
[6:43:37] <ahaegotrigger> so strong
[6:43:39] <+admiral_of_crunch> Nice Kappa
[6:43:42] <SoFarFetched> just leave it on this forever
[6:43:42] <+illoonar> TTours
[6:43:45] <CursedNobleman> its a grown up caulifla.
[6:44:01] <+admiral_of_crunch> I love the crazy hair in this series
[6:44:12] <Maya_Hett> nooo no the robot
[6:44:30] <$Charlie99993> Nah man, he's 100% Super Robot
[6:44:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> Kill the robot
[6:44:42] <+FxyDEV> Sakura couldnt even do that
[6:44:42] <franctastic_> Also all protagonist share one detail in their hairstyles
[6:44:45] <+MisterRockett> Plague the giant robots
[6:44:56] <parentheses8> It’d be hilarious if he just died there
[6:45:00] <SoFarFetched> his boner is just POPPIN out
[6:45:04] <SoFarFetched> for that robot
[6:45:10] <+FxyDEV> to eat food
[6:45:31] <CalderGaming> nekomarus die if they are killed
[6:45:32] <+m3chamike> that's very progressive
[6:45:33] <ahaegotrigger> how could he get murdered as he is now
[6:45:36] <franctastic_> He just fuckin explodes on the spot
[6:45:51] <+admiral_of_crunch> Robovirus!?
[6:45:54] <arkv01> wow that was some strong foreshadowing
[6:45:59] <Samex_Comex> He trips and falls on someone
[6:46:00] <arkv01> guess he's gonna go berserk?
[6:46:10] <SuperVaderMan> So if Nekomaru can just tank an anime blast from the bear, what if he just ignores the rules and kills everyone, just to see if the Bear can do anything about it
[6:46:11] <CursedNobleman> shes kinda dense.
[6:46:16] <TheMoenia> sonia is already missing the dick
[6:46:19] <JeedyJay> B U R D E N
[6:46:23] <+admiral_of_crunch> Sonia's in the nile
[6:46:25] <+FxyDEV> nekomaru as a toilet
[6:46:26] <ShockzNDrawe> he achieved Pat's ultimate dream
[6:46:27] <franctastic_> LUL
[6:46:31] <CursedNobleman> he cant shit tho
[6:46:35] <%ZiggySol> Can he shit as a robot?
[6:46:36] <arkv01> lose dick, become immortal :thinking:
[6:46:36] <+admiral_of_crunch> Can't shit
[6:46:36] <CursedNobleman> i think.
[6:46:42] <%Sweetangy021> Some people would argue the robot is hotter
[6:46:56] <terminusterminal> In 2077 they named my Island the-
[6:47:29] <TheAntiNihilist> this mood for would work if there weren't serious murder mysteries too
[6:47:32] <Samex_Comex> Now the island is weird
[6:47:38] <reonome> all around me are familiar faces
[6:47:41] <+admiral_of_crunch> The shittiness of the story is part of the fun! I makes the actual good bits stand out.
[6:47:51] <+FxyDEV> let the man shit!
[6:47:59] <+Tr1pkT12> You thought last trial is bad...
[6:48:06] <+Tr1pkT12> Wait till you see this one
[6:48:11] <+taltalheights> Were I a robot I could dispense from pants forever
[6:48:15] <arkv01> healthy wife you got there :)
[6:48:15] <SuperVaderMan> Of course Plague's wife is strong and loves food. She's practically a saiyan
[6:48:16] <CursedNobleman> that sums up her personality as well.
[6:48:33] <+admiral_of_crunch> Wait this is THAT trial, right? I remember this one being great.
[6:48:38] <+Spacemarine501> this one is amazing
[6:48:41] <CursedNobleman> maru is a circle
[6:48:42] <+FxyDEV> little kitty?
[6:48:52] <+MisterRockett> Probably like bein named Tiny.
[6:48:54] <TheAntiNihilist> IRONY
[6:48:56] <Maids4lyfe> maru also means man
[6:48:57] <JeedyJay> It's an "affectionate" form
[6:49:07] <arkv01> so he is a cyborg
[6:49:11] <Samex_Comex> He looks tough but he is soft like a kitten?
[6:49:15] <arkv01> got a tongue and all...
[6:49:15] <+AMadHollow> Lillie
[6:49:41] <+AMadHollow> little john was a big man not a small toilet
[6:49:47] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito should just not speak
[6:50:01] <TheMoenia> i love you, my perfectly manicured fingers
[6:50:07] <+admiral_of_crunch> He's such a worthless shit, love it.
[6:50:21] <franctastic_> Oh crap, you actually gonna stream this whole chapter too?
[6:50:44] <+admiral_of_crunch> The perfect woman
[6:50:57] <franctastic_> Ic ic
[6:51:21] <%Arancet> dont hear it, maybe with headphones you can
[6:51:54] <TheMoenia> maybe its like in "I have no mouth and I must scream"
[6:52:45] <franctastic_> Oh btw Monomi’s mini game is actually pretty sick
[6:53:03] <%SirFancySwank> its just a hint to 2 the class mode is non canon
[6:53:17] <UncleOliver> amogus
[6:53:24] <TheAntiNihilist> you don't even know this worlds logic yet Plague
[6:53:26] <+FxyDEV> sus
[6:53:50] <+admiral_of_crunch> It's, uh... Monokuma can cheat, and everyone else is running on anime rules.
[6:54:00] <TheAntiNihilist> the setting knows. you'll see
[6:54:04] <%Arancet> no, this series wallows in its own stupidity, luckily i enjoy that
[6:54:06] <TheMoenia> nagito speaking the truth for once
[6:54:22] <+Tr1pkT12> Remember this
[6:54:24] <+Promessa_EX> m64Cry m64Cry m64Cry
[6:54:25] <TheAntiNihilist> ..
[6:54:28] <+withguac> Lol
[6:54:49] <+withguac> This chat is so obvious lol
[6:54:59] <+admiral_of_crunch> Monokuma basically has God powers in these games, I find. Everyone else is either a superhuman or a regular human.
[6:55:16] <+admiral_of_crunch> The really crazy bullshit goes through him.
[6:55:24] <+FxyDEV> chat cant keep it in their pants for a 25 hour game
[6:55:27] <+admiral_of_crunch> Iirc
[6:55:28] <+FxyDEV> Sonia's headpat pose
[6:56:05] <+admiral_of_crunch> Super Shitting
[6:56:30] <Samex_Comex> Orange juice?
[6:56:31] <ShockzNDrawe> SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPEEEEEEEEEEEEEER
[6:56:33] <Samex_Comex> Oh

[6:56:39] <arkv01> mmm handy
[6:56:39] <SoFarFetched> Roy bas
[6:56:46] <arkv01> I'm impressed nekomaru
[6:56:58] <SuperVaderMan> What kind of soda is it
[6:57:00] <CursedNobleman> Rooibos, meaning "red bush"; is a broom-like member of the plant family Fabaceae that grows in South Africa's fynbos.
[6:57:00] <%lol_Last> Its franky like you said plague
[6:57:05] <SoFarFetched> he did say it was cola
[6:57:05] <Samex_Comex> No rocket punch BibleThump
[6:57:13] <SoFarFetched> so it could possibly be generic cola or like ACTUAL cola
[6:57:33] <%StridentSong> PepsiMaru
[6:57:45] <TheMoenia> its a chastity belt obviously.
[6:57:47] <Jjaz_R> The diaper is bolted on.
[6:58:04] <%Arancet> its a normal diaper bolted on im guessing
[6:58:06] <%SirFancySwank> i think its a fabric exterior for both monokuma and monomi
[6:58:14] <+admiral_of_crunch> Where does Mechamaru fit all his drank?
[6:58:35] <+admiral_of_crunch> The diaper stays on
[6:59:07] <SuperVaderMan> It's basically Saw, but worse somehow
[6:59:24] <ahaegotrigger> its saw but without the choices
[6:59:30] <%Arancet> delicious?!

[7:00:05] <SoFarFetched> Look this is monokuma
[7:00:07] <terminusterminal> Why are we looking at monomi's crotch
[7:00:10] <SoFarFetched> remember when he yelled "XANADU" in the first game
[7:00:15] <+EySoyCoco> that looked like... uhhh...
[7:00:15] <Cyral_Drive> babababa
[7:00:15] <+admiral_of_crunch> Spiral
