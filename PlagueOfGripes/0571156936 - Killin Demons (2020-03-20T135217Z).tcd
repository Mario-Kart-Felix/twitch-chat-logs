[0:33:28] <+Bonerlord911> Mission Information
[0:33:29] <Thelovelybison> it used to be left alt
[0:33:30] <+Bonerlord911> you went past it
[0:33:34] <Zhombiefood> just do it. press none. ffs
[0:33:34] <Cervarian> Should be L-Alt.
[0:33:54] <gsoto83> O Oh OH ITS MAGIC! You knowwwwwwww!
[0:34:02] <+zapper1234566> grenade launcher is god
[0:34:10] <Varadox> Yes it is.
[0:34:11] <Cowctus> Yooo
[0:34:13] <+zapper1234566> Yes, we tried to fight demons with mechs
[0:34:14] <Cowctus> That's fuckin rad
[0:34:16] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Humans went down swinging
[0:34:17] <gsoto83> Mech to fight the monster mechs
[0:34:18] <+silvery_cricket> Yeah boy
[0:34:21] <Viirus_Jones> Big dakka!
[0:34:22] <HorribleHog> can we get a game about those?
[0:34:25] <Thelovelybison> CYBERdemon
[0:34:28] <lordkyzer2> we 40k now
[0:34:29] <Skeletonmanners> there's cybernetics on demons but thats it
[0:34:32] <+Bonerlord911> its set in the 2100s
[0:34:39] <VectMachine> If I recall, Hugo Martin was one of the artists on Titanfall 2.
[0:34:40] <rabbitective> naaah
[0:34:46] <+KityLinn> lol
[0:34:47] <+zapper1234566> Imagine living on the giant pentagram summoning sigil
[0:34:48] <Fodderbot> fire.gif
[0:34:50] <+KityLinn> it's hell fire
[0:34:50] <Korndogg10> just dont look at it
[0:34:53] <brianthe12th> The director also worked on Pacific Rim, designing mechs
[0:34:55] <gsoto83> Hmmm, all tests are leading to the conclusion that... Doom might be cool
[0:34:55] <Amardeux> don't look at it too hard LUL
[0:34:55] <locatednin44> lol Doeman Kashu will save us in the year 2090.
[0:34:56] <brianthe12th> Hugo Martin
[0:34:57] <Blazeofflame> fire.png
[0:35:03] <friggnodin> you're not supposed to stop and stare at the assets LUL
[0:35:05] <HorribleHog> It's so weird, a lot of the visuals are worse than in 2016
[0:35:13] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Because demons
[0:35:27] <+KityLinn> you're supposed to look for like 5 seconds not 5 minutes
[0:35:32] <+Bonerlord911> turned him into a brainlet
[0:35:58] <donaghy> the director made the animators watch evil dead 2
[0:35:59] <cap_bon> Wait is he fighting around a mecha
[0:36:01] <HorribleHog> There are only so many animations you can pull off in 1st person
[0:36:03] <rabbitective> he turned into the huehue meme
[0:36:08] <brianthe12th> a lotta 'stop hittin yourself' ones
[0:36:10] <locatednin44> man's didn't touch it
[0:36:12] <+zapper1234566> you can gymnastics now
[0:36:15] <+KityLinn> lol
[0:36:17] <+Selectamo> he played Aladdin on SNES
[0:36:21] <Ghostars> There's your mecha stuff
[0:36:28] <rabbitective> monkey bar, we donkey kong now
[0:36:35] <+KityLinn> attack the weakpoint for massive damage
[0:36:45] <+KityLinn> yeah it does a red flashy when you hit it
[0:36:46] <Varadox> I think it's more like "If you hit the weakpoint" it'll tell you by making the enemy flash.
[0:36:54] <Blazeofflame> Doom Guy has many hobbies and talents he cultivates between holy murder sessions
[0:36:54] <seth45er> the glow red
[0:36:56] <Skeletonmanners> i love that they kept the stupid 90s monster names
[0:36:57] <+zapper1234566> you already passed 4
[0:36:58] <seth45er> they*
[0:37:06] <+NYCrownlessKing> the map will highlight the secrets for you.
[0:37:22] <ZippyPsycho> Did you get the standard or the deluxe edition?
[0:37:38] <+KityLinn> first death?
[0:37:50] <+KityLinn> it's fiiine
[0:38:00] <+Bonerlord911> @PlagueOfGripes you need to put the sticky bomb on the arachnotrons turret or it will KILL you
[0:38:03] <friggnodin> did he just reload by swapping out the whole gun
[0:38:13] <+Bonerlord911> @friggnodin there is no reloading in doom
[0:38:48] <awalr> a small amount of fuel magically regenerates over time
[0:38:49] <Korndogg10> how else do u get fuel ?
[0:38:55] <Haldosprime> It was still charging.
[0:38:59] <+Bonerlord911> @PlagueOfGripes the soldiers only require 1 but you had 0 fuel. it refills itself to 1 pip over time
[0:39:00] <+zapper1234566> it magicaly charges
[0:39:03] <Haldosprime> Gotta wait for the pip to charge
[0:39:04] <+KityLinn> you got one
[0:39:10] <+KityLinn> you get one free
[0:39:25] <+Bonerlord911> there are always fodder to use chainsaw on for ammo.
[0:39:26] <+Bonerlord911> always
[0:39:28] <+KityLinn> like deus ex
[0:39:28] <kiriagi862> man the difficulty is non-existent below nightmare thb
[0:39:35] <+zapper1234566> it gets better when you get like, 3 weapons
[0:39:40] <donaghy> full auto shotgun destroys your ammo early
[0:39:40] <Blazeofflame> I like that they added more obvious battle damage in this game
[0:39:43] <HorribleHog> I don't understand why cutscenes have to be a thing
[0:39:45] <+KityLinn> for sure
[0:40:07] <+zapper1234566> @HorribleHog people don't like standing in forced cut scenes. You can just mash space now
[0:40:11] <kiriagi862> I mean why not, they're skippable
[0:40:21] <+NYCrownlessKing> everything will do more damage, eventually.
[0:40:30] <+NYCrownlessKing> depends on the build you go for
[0:40:45] <brianthe12th> the cutscenes I've seen have been fairly brief, and most plot stuff you can read or ignore if you want
[0:40:50] <Korndogg10> you wail on the jobbers quite a bit and it does nothing
[0:40:50] <+KityLinn> show me your himitsus
[0:41:04] <+KityLinn> random bird cries
[0:41:14] <+KityLinn> plague is streaming from the forrest
[0:41:14] <+max_radical> waa me no likely cutscene :(
[0:41:26] <rabbitective> VIDEOGAME
[0:41:33] <awalr> eternal leans hard on pure videogame shit
[0:41:39] <Skeletonmanners> kinda amusing considering weapons didnt float in the 2d dooms
[0:41:42] <Korndogg10> i prefer first game weapon finding system as well
[0:41:51] <brianthe12th> It does have more cutscenes than 2016
[0:41:52] <Essixian> Those were hell switches, automaps were computer thingies.
[0:41:52] <+KityLinn> BAAA
[0:42:00] <HorribleHog> zapper1234566 I didn't like them either, but they already had the answer in 2016 intro, taking away player control is even further from what i like
[0:42:01] <brianthe12th> which I appreciate, but to each their own
[0:42:04] <gsoto83> Oh course theres sheep outside of Plauges place...
[0:42:16] <+silvery_cricket> feed them corn meal
[0:42:28] <Essixian> I haven't played Eternal yet, but it seems way more arcadey than 2016. Personally I don't mind.
[0:42:28] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes What was the wild beast you posted on twitter yesterday?
[0:42:34] <gsoto83> teach them to like the taste for DEMON FLESH
[0:42:37] <+silvery_cricket> Feed the sheep rice so they explode like pigeons
[0:42:38] <rabbitective> feed them the ps4
[0:42:44] <gsoto83> ^^^
[0:42:45] <Blazeofflame> Snapping turtle
[0:43:03] <+Cucamabungabu> I didn't know snapping turtles could be so smol and cute
[0:43:06] <+Pixel_Matt> you can't
[0:43:13] <HorribleHog> zapper1234566 when hayden's talking in the elevator and doomguy smashes the console for the title drop? that should've been every cutscene
[0:43:19] <awalr> don't bother right now, there's a drop that's too big to climb
[0:43:31] <Essixian> @PlagueOfGripes The map station reveals the level geometry, but secrets, pickups and such won't appear on the automap unless you go near them.
[0:43:40] <awalr> you get ways to return later
[0:43:42] <cap_bon> *Plants evolving to have as little nutrition as possible so they dont get eaten* Herbivores "dont mind if I do"
[0:44:04] <+max_radical> @HorribleHog stop playing the game, it's not for you. sorry
[0:44:12] <+KityLinn> that adoreable little green doom guy
[0:44:17] <Essixian> @cap_bon More like *Herbivores, being idiots* "STILL HUNGRY, EAT MORE."
[0:44:46] <HorribleHog> max_radical laeSusp which game?
[0:44:56] <+KityLinn> lol
[0:44:59] <+max_radical> both
[0:45:02] <Essixian> @HorribleHog Play the game if you want, don't listen to him. You're allowed to criticize things.
[0:45:04] <+KityLinn> the demons don't want you to go there
[0:45:13] <HorribleHog> max_radical if you say so dawg
[0:45:42] <HorribleHog> Essixian I'm aware but it bears spelling out
[0:45:44] <Guigondi> Let's take a moment to apreciate how much better the MAP in this game is better than the previous one
[0:45:45] <brianthe12th> They fix that actually, you'll see
[0:45:52] <HorribleHog> bares*
[0:45:54] <+max_radical> QQing in twitch chat about a game that come out like 10 hours ago doesn't scream "big fan" to me, chief
[0:45:57] <Essixian> Pop LUL
[0:45:57] <Blazeofflame> man, I had a dream where satan got runover on a country road and a frigging cow ate the corpse, so I had to kill this dumbass satan bovine
[0:46:00] <+KityLinn> wow
[0:46:06] <+KityLinn> that corpse freaked out for a second
[0:46:39] <+zapper1234566> secret up head, a real weird one
[0:46:41] <+KityLinn> praise the sun!
[0:46:49] <Essixian> EAT MY BLADE, DEMON TRASH tomatoKnife tomatoYell
[0:46:59] <cap_bon> Is this the "free glory kill" gun
[0:46:59] <PenguinPall> Im not up on my DOOM lore. Why are the demons fighting?
[0:47:07] <nutimik> from above I think
[0:47:13] <+KityLinn> demons are chaotic
[0:47:18] <Blazeofflame> F
[0:47:22] <+KityLinn> FIRST DEATH
[0:47:23] <awalr> demons are fighting because they're assholes
[0:47:24] <Korndogg10> kited LUK
[0:47:30] <+zapper1234566> for that secret, just go further left than the door
[0:47:30] <brianthe12th> you gotta sticky bomb the turret
[0:47:30] <+sunriser101> so when the little antropomorphic dog shows up?
[0:47:37] <seth45er> use the sticky bomb
[0:47:38] <rabbitective> he shot you with the meat ray
[0:47:43] <+Pixel_Matt> Grenade work better for the turrets
[0:47:50] <seth45er> on the little spiders gun
[0:47:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:48:02] <Essixian> Reminds me of that "I'M AT SOUP!" skit.
[0:48:05] <Skeletonmanners> wonder if enemies can infight in this
[0:48:06] <HorribleHog> every game i love is perfect in every way
[0:48:12] <splatterroomtacos> Look in the backgrounds for Mechwarriors
[0:48:13] <HorribleHog> Kappa
[0:48:15] <Doksumar> hell :)
[0:48:33] <+KityLinn> NICE
[0:48:41] <HorribleHog> that's weird
[0:48:55] <HorribleHog> i wonder if that is a difficulty thing
[0:49:01] <+KityLinn> discount cortana
[0:49:10] <+zapper1234566> go back out and to the right
[0:49:14] <PowerfulBlackGangs> They were in charge of everyone's energy
[0:49:35] <kiriagi862> nah, nightmare bottomless bits take off next to nothing as well
[0:49:38] <kiriagi862> pretty dumb
[0:49:48] <Fenlig> Use the truck
[0:49:55] <cap_bon> Fusion power isnt enough we need DEMON energy to power the future
[0:49:55] <+KityLinn> he knows
[0:50:06] <+KityLinn> lol
[0:50:14] <Essixian> You're supposed to jump from that other bus. :P
[0:50:24] <locatednin44> it's like you clipped up
[0:51:08] <HorribleHog> I wonder if it's the same team as in 2016
[0:51:26] <donaghy> @HorribleHog it is
[0:51:27] <hntronium> didn't you already find the doomguy doll?
[0:51:29] <splatterroomtacos> Too bad the demons cant die due to infighting
[0:51:32] <+zapper1234566> he did not
[0:51:37] <alphonseisbest> yup
[0:51:44] <hntronium> smh
[0:51:54] <$studleydoorite> I didn't take you as a yallow type of person
[0:51:58] <+zapper1234566> you get free one ups
[0:52:01] <cap_bon> you will look at all the fancy guns they rendered
[0:52:10] <hntronium> use those weapons
[0:52:10] <+zapper1234566> look up
[0:52:12] <Essixian> Nah, it's like a revive when you drop to 0 HP.
[0:52:13] <+zapper1234566> jumping puzzle
[0:52:15] <Fenlig> Health
[0:52:17] <kiriagi862> I think you can turn them off
[0:52:19] <alphonseisbest> hugo himself said that if u dont like switching weapons slot dont play new doom, on the no clip video @plagueofgripes
[0:52:20] <brianthe12th> one ups just let you revive on the spot
[0:52:25] <kiriagi862> which you probably should
[0:52:28] <splatterroomtacos> The other gamemode gives you 3 lives and its game over
[0:52:54] <hntronium> you'll take these video game and you'll like it
[0:52:57] <hntronium> gotta reach it
[0:53:21] <+KityLinn> I wonder if we're gonna see those.. hmmm
[0:53:40] <+zapper1234566> to be fair
[0:53:49] <Blazeofflame> can you beat this game with only the plasma cutter?
[0:53:49] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to get Bannerlord
[0:53:49] <+zapper1234566> if demons poured out of hell
[0:53:50] <splatterroomtacos> sounds about right
[0:53:55] <+TQuick101> it's actually just tomorrow
[0:53:57] <alphonseisbest> around there
[0:53:58] <+zapper1234566> I'd be getting baptized
[0:54:14] <brianthe12th> That last bit is a bit too real rn
[0:54:16] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes It comes out end of the month
[0:54:17] <Essixian> Chainsaw kills don't drop as much ammo either, I've noticed. In 2016 every chainsawing would pretty much top you up completely, here you gain like ~20% of your ammo pool.
[0:54:20] <locatednin44> @zapper1234566 I would be getting armed
[0:54:42] <locatednin44> @zapper1234566 cause God is no longer on your side at that point
[0:54:51] <kiriagi862> just another healthbar on top of many health upgrades
[0:54:59] <hntronium> oh believe me you're gonna worry about running out of health soon enough
[0:54:59] <HorribleHog> what a weird addition to a 1st person shooter
[0:55:02] <Essixian> But you also get way more chainsaw fuel, and the last pip of chainsaw fuel regenerates so you'll never NOT have access to it.
[0:55:03] <+zapper1234566> >implying guns can work against the forces of the devil
[0:55:05] <+KityLinn> there was fall damage in the last one
[0:55:08] <gsoto83> Your legs are like trucks, they don't take fall damage
[0:55:11] <lordkyzer2> in beta
[0:55:18] <HorribleHog> Or rather, what a weird addition to doom LUL
[0:55:19] <locatednin44> @zapper1234566 implying prayer would
[0:55:28] <Essixian> You have fists.
[0:55:32] <hntronium> @zapper1234566 They sure can if you juice them with argent energy
[0:55:34] <donaghy> chainsaw
[0:55:36] <+KityLinn> the fists don't do much
[0:55:37] <+zapper1234566> they fear the mark of the D O O M S L A Y E R
[0:55:42] <cap_bon> the lack of ammo capacity is unfortunate
[0:55:43] <kiriagi862> @hntronium I mean Plague will, I guess
[0:55:50] <locatednin44> let me thoughts and prayer these demons to death
[0:55:55] <locatednin44> lol
[0:56:01] <+illoonar> lole
[0:56:01] <Fenlig> Have you knocked the head into the ribcage?
[0:56:11] <+FadingEmber> I wouldn't be surprised if games got pushed back due to Covid hurting physical releases
[0:56:17] <Essixian> "urngh"
[0:56:20] <jiin6> the head donks great
[0:56:26] <hntronium> what difficulty is plague running? baby mode?
[0:56:30] <+KityLinn> baby mech
[0:56:32] <Korndogg10> looks like a mecha suit
[0:56:45] <awalr> terror-forming
[0:56:52] <hntronium> hellification
[0:56:58] <hntronium> in common parlance
[0:57:02] <+Punishedkaiger> Humans will fight back with our army of Steiner Scout Mechs
[0:57:09] <cap_bon> Wheres the EDF monkaS
[0:57:14] <gsoto83> You really need to put your brand on everything
[0:57:15] <hntronium> Probably wrecked
[0:57:25] <hntronium> Along with all the cool sci fi shit
[0:57:26] <+TQuick101> wow that looks jank
[0:57:32] <HorribleHog> oh god
[0:57:36] <HorribleHog> doomguy is knuckles
[0:57:37] <gsoto83> He punches the wall
[0:57:38] <+KityLinn> I can't
[0:57:42] <Skeletonmanners> those walls are not yellow enough
[0:57:46] <gsoto83> Big boi
[0:57:48] <+silvery_cricket> pat couldn't tell them apart
[0:57:49] <orphancrippler_> humans cant fight a virus we dont stand a chance with hell
[0:57:50] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Were there any sexy demons so far?

[0:58:25] <hntronium> Sure you can get them, mechwarrior got a thing didn't it
[0:58:28] <cap_bon> Earths defenders gave it their best at least
[0:58:29] <TheAsylumCat> I'm a weeb, but I prefer western mechs
[0:58:37] <HorribleHog> Ah, living legends...
[0:58:45] <hntronium> I prefer eastern mechs
[0:58:45] <locatednin44> And I will be killing demons in my Sandrock
[0:58:49] <alphonseisbest> yeah cuz most western mech design sux

[1:00:24] <HorribleHog> wow that looks really bad the zombie standing unaffected
[1:00:29] <cap_bon> Make it as slow as that one knife kill in saving private ryan
[1:00:35] <twenty112> Yes, the demons terraformed earth into a platforming dungeon
[1:00:38] <splatterroomtacos> go from the side on one of the standard zombie for a Bane-style backbreaker
[1:00:51] <+KityLinn> it's true platforming is a thing from hell
[1:00:58] <hntronium> you get those fucking rotation mario flame things later on
[1:01:05] <hntronium> its definitely a mario
[1:01:21] <alrobot2014> whatcha sellen

[1:06:17] <ovan20> LUL
[1:06:28] <brianthe12th> switch to shotgun sticky bombs and shoothim
[1:06:33] <Daxalog> You can use the shotguns grenade for it
[1:06:47] <+punit216> shotgun sticky also works
[1:06:49] <Blazeofflame> POP
[1:06:50] <Essixian> Plop LUL
[1:06:51] <+theobble> moon2O
[1:07:13] <lordkyzer2> why have they done this
[1:07:27] <Essixian> @lordkyzer2 VIDYAGAMES
[1:07:35] <+theobble> it's fine
[1:07:40] <+alucard929> You ever just punch a man so hard his head goes into his chest?
[1:07:52] <+theobble> can't have every videogame taking itself too seriouslyt
[1:07:55] <ovan20> can't wait for the 10am cartoon full of gore LUL
[1:08:03] <brianthe12th> yeah I think they explicitly said that they'e goin for more a saturday morning cartoon feel
[1:08:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:08:29] <twenty112> There's a good one from behind on the fireball boys. I think? Or the generic zomboid guys
[1:08:46] <+zapper1234566> use the shotgun grenade on the archanetron
[1:08:47] <+drabberfaun535> but is the video game ass cartoon identity good?
[1:08:48] <hntronium> the cannon scope is perfect for taking out those turrets
[1:09:17] <Skeletonmanners> kinda interesting how early arachnotrons are in this game considering they're one of the last enemies introduced in doom 2
[1:09:18] <hntronium> @drabberfaun535 yes
[1:09:30] <cap_bon> oh joy more spiders
[1:09:39] <HorribleHog> why did that cutscene need to happen
[1:09:52] <alphonseisbest> stick and move stick and move
[1:09:58] <+zapper1234566> No one cares about the cut scenes
[1:10:09] <kingbaconcrispy> In 2016 a punch would always put them into stun.
[1:10:20] <ovan20> it IS a shotgun, they are not known for accuracy.
[1:10:22] <splatterroomtacos> it screams
[1:10:24] <HorribleHog> nobody cares for the woods anymore
[1:10:29] <+TQuick101> It's MY arm now
[1:10:30] <+drabberfaun535> @HorribleHog because this is secretly DMC6
[1:10:37] <jiin6> no i don't want to hit myself
[1:10:39] <HorribleHog> drabberfaun535 laeOMG
[1:10:52] <hntronium> It only gets worse from here plague
[1:10:54] <PowerfulBlackGangs> "But I arm from there!"
[1:10:57] <Skeletonmanners> id imagine once you unlock more stuff its you who pressures instead
[1:10:58] <%Gogogolem> Gogogolem subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! 
[1:11:01] <Essixian> @hntronium *better
[1:11:10] <cap_bon> I do like how you can go from 10 hp no ammo to full HP full ammo super quick
[1:11:18] <hntronium> @Essixian Same thing
[1:11:27] <Blazeofflame> gogogolem is ready for birthing
[1:11:27] <+theobble> oh yeah tear off my horrible spider limb and stuff it into my eye socket, daddy moon2L
[1:11:40] <+Derbisol> this is one of the few shooters i think i would like better with a controller
[1:11:51] <hntronium> @Skeletonmanners You'd think, but the pressure the stronger enemies put on you is fucking strong
[1:11:59] <+zapper1234566> grenade is equipment launcher
[1:12:11] <awalr> grenade is already on middle mouse too
[1:13:29] <+theobble> moon2SUFFER

[1:14:37] <jiin6> so like Dis- i mean UAC
[1:14:37] <Ghost_riderr_29> didnt vega...die in the last game?
[1:14:48] <Blazeofflame> he got better
[1:14:50] <brianthe12th> you got his backup right before destroying him
[1:14:53] <+thackattack00> Slayer made a backup
[1:14:57] <jiin6> no vega was with doom guy
[1:14:58] <hntronium> Vega's a robot, he can't die
[1:15:03] <brianthe12th> a very brief moment, but a good one
[1:15:25] <Ghost_riderr_29> but wasnt his entire AI base destroyed tho?
[1:15:37] <jiin6> yes but back up tho
[1:15:41] <kingbaconcrispy> Nah backed up data
[1:15:41] <HorribleHog> nah his AI got backed up to a floppy don't worry
[1:15:44] <+justianxix> uses 6
[1:15:51] <splatterroomtacos> 6
[1:15:51] <brianthe12th> it was more like his control over the facility that got destroyed I guess
[1:15:53] <hntronium> 6 shots
[1:15:53] <Essixian> It uses 6 bullets.
[1:16:05] <HorribleHog> I wish it was a floppy that would've been funny.
[1:16:09] <twenty112> L O R E
[1:16:11] <hntronium> Its worth it
[1:16:14] <hntronium> Its strong
[1:16:14] <+justianxix> 6 shots in one
[1:16:15] <jiin6> its a powerful shot
[1:16:17] <Whyverns> hits like a truck tho
[1:16:20] <+NormenKD> it uses 6 :)
[1:16:25] <hntronium> Takes out arachno turrets in 1

[1:17:48] <HorribleHog> better dead than read chereshrin
[1:17:52] <HorribleHog> red*
[1:17:55] <otakon17> are we slallying Dooms?
[1:17:58] <fallenverto81> At best they should had sent up their most smartest, creative, and genetically superior into space.
[1:18:01] <HorribleHog> but also read
[1:18:04] <+justianxix> the Woolie Itis
[1:18:12] <jiin6> welcome to hentai
[1:18:15] <hntronium> Those tentacles are fucking cheap
[1:18:16] <otakon17> Kill it with fire!
[1:18:16] <splatterroomtacos> slap
[1:18:21] <brianthe12th> Is Woolie gonna be playing this?
[1:18:26] <hntronium> I think you do
[1:18:27] <otakon17> oh you know it
[1:18:28] <+theobble> John Doom is here to fix everything! By teaming off arms and sticking them into holes!
[1:18:45] <otakon17> did you see the "head mashed into the ribs" yet for the zombies?
[1:18:51] <Katorskay> Same
[1:18:58] <HorribleHog> he did and he loves it otakon17
[1:19:01] <hntronium> Shotgun ammo
[1:19:04] <brianthe12th> It was thanks to his LP that I got the slayers collection weeks ago and very eager to get this one
[1:19:06] <otakon17> it's great isn't it?
[1:19:07] <+zapper1234566> you didnt do the secret
[1:19:07] <Korndogg10> its called hentai and its art
[1:19:15] <otakon17> oh shit Cacodemons!
[1:19:18] <+zapper1234566> you got close enough to proc the alert
[1:19:26] <otakon17> the BLOOD MIST
[1:19:42] <hntronium> They want you under pressure
[1:19:58] <foreverN2dust> The last bit of gas recharges. Use it often.
[1:20:13] <alphonseisbest> gas gas gas step on the gas
[1:20:24] <hntronium> Its not indiscriminate if they're all demons
[1:20:31] <Skeletonmanners> i love those dopey little arms cacodemons have
[1:20:37] <hntronium> That's very much discrimination against the mortally challenged
[1:20:48] <gsoto83> with that barking, it made me think that DoomGuy is Tim allen
[1:20:52] <CaptainFrankincense> does the caco demon still have a butthole?
[1:21:12] <inebriated_llama1> use sticky bombs from your shotgun, the grenade isn't any use @plagueofgripes
[1:21:17] <Korndogg10> bruh
[1:21:21] <foreverN2dust> See? The gas already recharged in that time before you died.
[1:21:25] <Skeletonmanners> yea tomatoes were jerks in 2016, id imagine this is the same
[1:21:36] <+theobble> Yeah stinger grenade works too
[1:21:42] <+Punishedkaiger> Cocodemon a fuck
[1:22:12] <otakon17> leave them for medkits tehre Plague
[1:22:33] <hntronium> They are basically ammo and health pickups aren't they
[1:22:35] <+LiquidDinosaur> Ive been out of the loop. is Doom Slayer canonically Doomguy from the first game?
[1:22:43] <hntronium> @LiquidDinosaur Yes
[1:22:54] <otakon17> that cartoon Cacodemon never gets old
[1:22:56] <otakon17> no
[1:22:56] <hntronium> He's got the suit and everything from the first game
[1:22:59] <brianthe12th> do the cacodemons not spit balls anymore?
[1:23:05] <hntronium> They still spit em
[1:23:06] <otakon17> they're a diffferent character but the original Doomarine is referenced
[1:23:14] <donaghy> Use the sticky bomb shotgun mod on the cacodemons
[1:23:15] <otakon17> Spider tanks?!
[1:23:16] <brianthe12th> they seem to bite way more often
[1:23:18] <+LiquidDinosaur> i played through a bit of Doom 1. Like, the first act? I Just cant really get into it because playing that kind of "fake 3D" early FPS makes me dizzy
[1:23:24] <Haldosprime> Nice turret shot
[1:23:46] <cap_bon> I hope you can still get that Wesker style long range glory kill upgrade again
[1:23:50] <Whyverns> the shotgun sticky granade can also be used for the cacodemons
[1:24:12] <+zapper1234566> just use the grenade mod
[1:24:13] <hntronium> Did you see that fucking DMC door
[1:24:16] <+LiquidDinosaur> like when i move im acutely aware of how im not actually "moving" and the map is just sliding around me. Thats how those old games work right? thats why there couldnt be any "real" Z layers so you could take an elevator up or down but cant have a floor directly above another floor?
[1:24:23] <otakon17> ONE SHOT MAN
[1:24:32] <otakon17> pfthahaha
[1:24:34] <jiin6> DONK
[1:24:36] <Whyverns> yeah the long range glory kill is still in
[1:24:37] <rabbitective> im making it harder for myself Kappa
[1:24:39] <otakon17> it's the bug eyes
[1:25:00] <otakon17> so the chainsaw is on a cooldown now huh?
[1:25:02] <+LiquidDinosaur> put a banging donk on it
[1:25:03] <hntronium> Don't worry plague, you'll either get into that habit or die
[1:25:06] <otakon17> Remember when it's ready to refill
[1:25:22] <otakon17> it's an electric chainsaw obviously! with a rechargable battery!
[1:25:23] <Korndogg10> so the chainsaw has infinie fuel
[1:25:28] <jiin6> i mean yeah but videogames
[1:25:28] <+justianxix> I love the look they give you as their head gets stuffed into their chests
[1:25:32] <hntronium> The recoil sucks
[1:25:34] <otakon17> they rattle the bones
[1:25:37] <Whyverns> yeah they are ass
[1:25:39] <+sal00nn> yup
[1:25:48] <HorribleHog> i get those healthpacks are closer to the original but the yellow sheen looks kinda weird on 'em
[1:25:48] <CaptainFrankincense> so yeah use a ripsaw instead
[1:25:52] <Haldosprime> Its a vibrating chainsaw
[1:25:52] <awalr> video game chainsaws are lightsabers
[1:26:01] <+LiquidDinosaur> how long passed between Doom 2 and this
[1:26:02] <otakon17> and videogame shotguns are shit
[1:26:02] <Jimevera> This is a custom one made for mexican drug cartels
[1:26:02] <cap_bon> Chainsaws LOVE to get jammed
[1:26:04] <rabbitective> yeah but this is a future chainsaw
[1:26:05] <foreverN2dust> I used one once and it stuck in a tree. NotLikeThis
[1:26:11] <otakon17> except for THIS shotgun
[1:26:14] <+theobble> It's arcade style gameplay. Giving doom realistic gameplay is a dumb idea anyways.
[1:26:20] <HorribleHog> this is a fancy chainsaw restaurant!
[1:26:22] <otakon17> I think Woolie will probably progress around the same as you
[1:26:23] <hntronium> Woolie will have a hard time
[1:26:24] <brianthe12th> basically reality sucks
[1:26:25] <gsoto83> They are also hard to handle, you swing tha thing, IT will probably take a chunk out of your leg
[1:26:32] <hypersongi> chainsaws are unrealistically cool in vidya. IRL chainsaws are pretty meh~
[1:26:33] <kingbaconcrispy> Woolie is already betraying the UAC for a jetpack.
[1:26:36] <hntronium> There's so much shit you unlock
[1:26:38] <splatterroomtacos> Im gonna go with bad
[1:26:40] <+Punishedkaiger> Woolie is probably gonna have a bad time
[1:26:45] <+Qsmash_> depends how big the areas are cuz he gets lost easily
[1:27:00] <Skeletonmanners> prolly cuz those tentacles are like trees
[1:27:01] <HorribleHog> they remind you of the trees in your backyard
[1:27:11] <+LiquidDinosaur> in Warhammer, do you think people use chainswords for utilitarian purposes? Or maybe they use chain-axes for logging? Chainaxes are typically associated with Chaos, but really, a chainsaw and an axe are two tools designed for the same function so combining the two makes more sense than a chainsword
[1:27:11] <otakon17> No ammo? CHAINSAW!
[1:27:22] <BakaAkaKeri> enters stream. Hi how is every ... oh fuck right off with that in game hud.
[1:27:25] <brianthe12th> I like how you can have an actual collection of the figures you get through the game on display in the slayer's mancave
[1:27:37] <otakon17> So does the Mods use ammo too or recharge like the chainsaw?
[1:27:44] <hntronium> It's satisfying because those tentacles are cheap ass motherfuckers that always pop up and get hits in
[1:27:47] <otakon17> also the HUD seems like a downgrade to DOOM 2016
[1:27:49] <+LiquidDinosaur> "If we run out of bullets, they'll wish we hadn't"
[1:28:02] <%glasphemy> plague said goblins
[1:28:03] <kingbaconcrispy> Man the soundtrack slaps
[1:28:04] <alphonseisbest> yup thats a goblin alright
[1:28:08] <+justianxix> Everyone has their own personally goblins
[1:28:09] <brianthe12th> the icons for the gas and equipment should be bigger tbh
[1:28:09] <otakon17> Plague loves his shotty
[1:28:11] <rabbitective> you are the first person ive seen strugle this much for ammo
[1:28:15] <brianthe12th> i could barely tell when they're ready
[1:28:17] <Skeletonmanners> doom 2016 had ammo upgrades so im gonna assume this one does too
[1:28:21] <+theobble> It's got survival horror elements which you can love or hate
[1:28:23] <kingbaconcrispy> Do kids still say slap?
[1:28:34] <otakon17> oh goddammit
[1:28:37] <otakon17> ONE HP!
[1:28:41] <jacewolf_is_the_best> oh no
[1:28:43] <hntronium> Its not a death if you fall
[1:28:52] <hntronium> Just some damage and a reset
[1:28:53] <otakon17> that scree was nuts
[1:28:57] <+theobble> SCRAWWWWWW moon2H
[1:29:01] <hntronium> I really appreciate it
[1:29:06] <ambadev> reee
[1:29:16] <Whyverns> if you do a glory kill on its side it makes it go boom boom
[1:29:17] <brianthe12th> that noise is pretty faithful to its original death sound in doom 2
[1:29:18] <otakon17> so the machinegun has a sniper rifle mode now?
[1:29:21] <otakon17> also VEGA is back!
[1:29:31] <hntronium> If you run out of ammo just chainsaw and get it back
[1:29:36] <otakon17> I like the little plastic icon
[1:29:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Yeah, but the low max ammo means you aren't really stockpiling it either
[1:29:37] <Blazeofflame> it always did
[1:29:44] <awalr> chainsawing needs to be something you continuously do on reflect
[1:30:02] <otakon17> he IS moving though
[1:30:02] <brianthe12th> Huge incarnate
[1:30:03] <splatterroomtacos> slide to the left
[1:30:03] <cap_bon> The demons are terraforming earth into a video game level
[1:30:05] <HorribleHog> he's just dancin'
[1:30:11] <rabbitective> its a living
[1:30:17] <otakon17> I think it's a 2D
[1:30:23] <Melchior_the_Wise> More like Hella-Forming
[1:30:24] <jiin6> he got a big ol' hat on
[1:30:30] <kingbaconcrispy> Nah, it's 2d sliding I think.
[1:30:32] <Varadox> Could be a 3D model turned into a 2D sprite.
[1:30:33] <HorribleHog> oh yeah it is moving i thought it was just stomping in place
[1:30:36] <hntronium> I love all these huge fucking mechs
[1:30:39] <otakon17> it's just kinda "wobbling"
[1:30:58] <fallenverto81> @Melchior_the_Wise clever.
[1:31:05] <brianthe12th> 'Hell Priests'
[1:31:12] <Korndogg10> fire jpeg

[1:31:17] <HorribleHog> very cool

[1:31:21] <mizamar> thats so metal
[1:31:22] <Jimevera> Hes like the giant from time bandits
[1:31:24] <cap_bon> didnt they change their renderer this game so its easier to mod
[1:31:26] <+LiquidDinosaur> its like Cronus. or an emperor titan.
[1:31:36] <ambadev> werk werk werk
[1:31:41] <hntronium> It's more of a chaos titan
[1:31:46] <Cowctus> They work hard
[1:31:47] <HorribleHog> I'm sure that won't be a level
[1:31:51] <sad_toast_> Los Angeles looking better than it is today
[1:31:54] <brianthe12th> cronos and the temple of pandora vibes
[1:31:55] <otakon17> >mobile oppression palace
[1:31:55] <+RealPT1> they look like wh40k titans
[1:31:55] <HorribleHog> It's ok looking
[1:32:07] <hntronium> yes
[1:32:10] <alphonseisbest> lets the frames hit the floor
[1:32:16] <Cowctus> oh god
[1:32:20] <Cowctus> mongolian throat singers
[1:32:20] <+LiquidDinosaur> i mean, the only real major difference between a Chaos and Loyalist stuff is "are there spikes" and "are there human HEADS with the skin still on instead of just skulls?"
[1:32:22] <otakon17> ow my spirit! Kawaii Desu RIP AND TEAR

[1:34:52] <$doomp12> horned animals are all jerks
[1:34:53] <sad_toast_> it's not a Bethesda game with out fast traveling
[1:34:57] <cap_bon> Are sheep really as dumb and stubborn as you describe them as ?
[1:34:58] <hntronium> It pleases pat and his mind goblins
[1:34:59] <brianthe12th> Exactly, thats a big improvement
[1:35:07] <jiin6> its meant to pick up stuff

[1:35:21] <%Gogogolem> Hell carpenters.
[1:35:28] <kingbaconcrispy> Demons don't fuck arounds. They have hard working architechs

[1:35:33] <crusader_heide> Naga Sadow?!?!
[1:35:33] <otakon17> Deag Nilox huh?
[1:35:36] <%Gogogolem> the Hell Carpenters union is super strong.

[1:35:50] <LixFury> bread demons make bread
[1:35:52] <jiin6> lot of Artists in hell, they're made to be tortured Kappa

[1:36:03] <alphonseisbest> b-but doggie tho
[1:36:13] <crusader_heide> xbox original interface here
[1:36:24] <hypersongi> Hell is like they hated Heaven, so they became demons, but they only know how to build heavenly structures, but said, "okay, but well make it in our own eay."
[1:36:28] <hypersongi> i think thats cool
[1:36:28] <hntronium> Yes
[1:36:29] <Fenlig> helps get his dick hard
[1:36:33] <rabbitective> yes
[1:36:35] <+Lost_Zombie> Suffering motivates the work
[1:36:41] <hntronium> It could be more on fire
[1:36:43] <alphonseisbest> it amke him feel big plague, let him have this
[1:36:43] <brianthe12th> they make the titans invincible apparently
[1:36:44] <+justianxix> makes a guy feel good looking down
[1:36:47] <rabbitective> makes him horny
[1:36:48] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It's inspirational to the Demon soldiers 4Head
[1:36:50] <Nebuchadnezzar_II> supervision is vital
[1:36:57] <brianthe12th> only after killing the priest can they be killed it seems

[1:38:07] <hntronium> There's the lore in front of the door
[1:38:18] <hntronium> Goodbye missed lore
[1:38:18] <+BakiinPlaysStuff> Psychoanalyze the demon so that they become self conscious
[1:38:28] <+TQuick101> I'm just waiting for those background voices to say "starrrrs"

[1:40:47] <fallenverto81> Fortress of COOM
[1:40:49] <alphonseisbest> disk
[1:40:52] <rabbitective> fortress OF DOOM
[1:40:52] <alphonseisbest> disks
[1:40:55] <otakon17> let's see what a Slayer Gate is
[1:40:55] <hntronium> Challenges
[1:40:57] <cap_bon> Your performance was adequate you get nothing
[1:41:00] <Odaik> it's like the lego games and the red bricks
[1:41:03] <+plus_on_black> Shout out to my guy Plague, Good Afternoon to you.
[1:41:07] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I love that. Like it's the hideout for a Saturday morning cartoon villain
[1:41:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> MEANWHILE
[1:41:09] <Skeletonmanners> Lufia and the Fortress of Doom?
[1:41:23] <otakon17> Slayers Gates are basically extra combat scenarios
[1:41:38] <jiin6> it burbs fire at them
[1:41:45] <otakon17> You now have a rechargable flamethrower that gives you ARMOR
[1:41:48] <+theobble> moon2POGGYWOGGY üí® CurseLit urp
[1:42:04] <hntronium> You can set them on fire and still get health from melee kills
[1:42:08] <otakon17> Make sure you IMMOLATE then KILL for Armor charges
[1:42:10] <+NYCrownlessKing> dot that drops armor
[1:42:10] <jiin6> they pinata in armor
[1:42:15] <cap_bon> so another thing to manage while fighting
[1:42:17] <brianthe12th> you can glory kill enemies on fire and get health and armor
[1:42:22] <jacewolf_is_the_best> Doom
[1:42:24] <Nebuchadnezzar_II> just like in real life
[1:42:29] <hntronium> That's what it was for Pat's run
[1:42:29] <rabbitective> not really, you are just bad
[1:42:29] <ThirdPersonPhil> it probably has a non linear life bar
[1:42:31] <ScreamLord> What difficulty are yo on?
[1:42:33] <otakon17> Shoot to stagger
[1:42:35] <+drabberfaun535> just dont get hit
[1:42:40] <twenty112> Don't forget running!
[1:42:40] <hntronium> There's tons of gunplay
[1:42:41] <otakon17> you're gonna get hit
[1:42:49] <hntronium> You need to kill the enemy fast
[1:43:02] <otakon17> light on fire, shoot and then punch
[1:43:15] <hntronium> Look around
[1:43:52] <Odaik> how many mouse buttons do you have?
[1:44:03] <cap_bon> Australia looks like its getting fcked up on that map
[1:44:45] <Whyverns> australia is always getting fucked
[1:44:58] <jiin6> @cap_bon good
[1:45:24] <jiin6> australia = hell anyway
[1:45:33] <otakon17> lub the boof
[1:45:36] <otakon17> he wants lub
[1:45:39] <Odaik> ah isnt that the macro button? I've seen those but they're not really buttons they have macros that are programmable or are assigned to "burst"
[1:45:43] <lucidsplit> you gotta rebind that mouse button in the software i thnk
[1:45:48] <LixFury> There are collars for that
[1:45:49] <cap_bon> Its ok the Australian pm will be in Hawaii till this whole hell invasion thing blows over Kappa
[1:45:54] <crusader_heide> i want to simpsons strangle my neighbors dog so bad
[1:46:07] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes You don't get it man, he HAS to tell you when a fly farts
[1:46:31] <+sal00nn> Cats are better
[1:46:44] <otakon17> boost your armor?
[1:46:50] <hntronium> Find out later
[1:46:55] <seth45er> get ammo!
[1:46:59] <+arancet> youll get blood punch in about 5 min
[1:47:14] <Daxalog> You pick the ammo icon
[1:47:14] <hntronium> The ammo ones I guess
[1:47:18] <CaptainFrankincense> the buckshot icon
[1:47:18] <Whyverns> those are runes
[1:47:18] <donaghy> each bonus pick 2
[1:47:21] <+arancet> you choose hp/armor/ammo here
[1:47:21] <splatterroomtacos> its the shell icons
[1:47:24] <Amardeux> each of those of icons are the armor/health/ammo upgrade
[1:47:26] <+arancet> and match them to get the extra bonus
[1:47:35] <Daxalog> The other perks are elsewhere.
[1:47:35] <+Pixel_Matt> The bullet icons give ammo
[1:47:39] <Whyverns> this is like the argent cells
[1:47:47] <hntronium> There's more stuff later
[1:47:47] <gsoto83> well... just git gud
[1:47:49] <+zapper1234566> napalm belch tbh
[1:47:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:48:04] <hntronium> The argent suit upgrades are later
[1:48:06] <+theobble> Quickdraw belch looks good to me
[1:48:13] <splatterroomtacos> Shell icons give ammo
[1:48:23] <rilou501> Picking a symbol boosts that aspect
[1:48:23] <+sal00nn> Now that you can regen armor you'll be at max health more often?
[1:48:26] <+QuadraticGravity> One of the bullet icons
[1:48:29] <otakon17> HEALTH or ARMOR
[1:48:29] <rabbitective> you are still here?
[1:48:30] <Fenlig> Loot Magnet is pretty good!
[1:48:31] <Whyverns> whats important is the stat it gives you
[1:48:35] <otakon17> I would go ARMOR
[1:48:35] <hntronium> You'll encounter bigger demons a lot after a bit
[1:48:39] <Amardeux> loot magnet is pretty good
[1:48:39] <CaptainFrankincense> armour seems better
[1:48:57] <hntronium> Plague
[1:48:58] <awalr> i don't think you get the trait until you pick both upgrades
[1:48:59] <otakon17> Means you don't need to run for pickups
[1:49:01] <rabbitective> jesus
[1:49:03] <hntronium> You have no idea how good it is
[1:49:05] <otakon17> and you can get them from farther away
[1:49:05] <LixFury> Because enamie health drops
[1:49:11] <+corrosivePaladin> It would suck in the health and armor better?
[1:49:14] <+QuadraticGravity> If makes the spray of colorful ammo and health that you keep missing fly at you
[1:49:28] <hntronium> Choose wisely
[1:49:28] <Daxalog> Also you just got a more reliable way to get armor on demand
[1:49:34] <Whyverns> you get them all by the end anyways
[1:49:35] <donaghy> you unlock them all
[1:49:42] <+zapper1234566> just pick an ammo one
[1:49:44] <rabbitective> just chose one and move on
[1:50:08] <+theobble> JOHN DOOM SMASH
[1:50:12] <awalr> i think they just want to incentivize you to spread points around
[1:50:12] <Fraudbear> old man plague doesn't know how to play doom
[1:50:20] <hntronium> No he doesnt
[1:50:25] <hntronium> DOOMGUY canonized

[1:50:52] <otakon17> The Doomguy joke TOO
[1:50:55] <+LiquidDinosaur> Doomguy, welcome to the #Resistance
[1:50:57] <Nebuchadnezzar_II> that one guy who's doomed all the time, you know
[1:50:57] <otakon17> oh I love this game
[1:51:03] <twenty112> They leaned into the videogame so hard
[1:51:10] <otakon17> It's the guy that does what all the Dooming!
[1:51:13] <theredfox930000> so it's real now
[1:51:13] <GOOPAHIPHOP> he is doomguy forever
[1:51:19] <+LiquidDinosaur> Uh, if they deny he exists why is their news anchor tealking about him
[1:51:23] <otakon17> a literal ONE MANY ARMY
[1:51:28] <JoeBecomesJoe> Doomslayer was my fathers name, please call me Doomguy
[1:51:30] <otakon17> you are LITERALLY a one man army
[1:51:30] <Fenlig> But he's very cool though!
[1:51:35] <hntronium> Plague, he's a literal one man massacre
[1:51:35] <LixFury> He's killing the important ones
[1:51:35] <Whyverns> VERY GOOD AT KILLING
[1:51:35] <TomFrank> Bill doesnt have the same gravitas
[1:51:40] <hntronium> He killed a hell priest
[1:51:40] <Daxalog> Killing one hell priest reduced the hell force by 30 percent remember
[1:51:41] <gsoto83> Yeah, but none of them are doom guy
[1:51:45] <+corrosivePaladin> To be fair hes the only one that isnt bad at killing stuff
[1:51:46] <otakon17> you kill the leaders
[1:51:46] <rabbitective> he is the only one doing it
[1:51:51] <otakon17> the rest of the snake dies
[1:51:52] <twenty112> He's gonna kill the big important demons. Maybe?
[1:51:55] <crusader_heide> Too cool for hell.
[1:51:56] <theredfox930000> it's like how you saved dragon ball
[1:52:04] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Surgical strikes
[1:52:08] <crusader_heide> Is doom guy going to heaven, even though he has no faith?
[1:52:15] <rabbitective> he just killed a general that supervised the world invasion
[1:52:23] <+Pixel_Matt> I mean killing that Hell Priest reduced Earths corruption by 30%
[1:52:27] <+justianxix> look right

[1:57:12] <otakon17> Yes. In my best Dorn voice
[1:57:17] <+arancet> theyre blood packs
[1:57:55] <twenty112> Exultia OBLITERATE!!!
[1:58:10] <crusader_heide> Architecture reminds me little of naboo
[1:58:31] <JoeBecomesJoe> or the priests and I
[1:58:31] <+zapper1234566> These are old fantasy men
[1:58:43] <JoeBecomesJoe> They came north with the priests and I
[1:58:49] <TomFrank> theyre thinking that because of "them and I"
[1:58:50] <Nebuchadnezzar_II> i'ts a janky translation
[1:58:55] <+theobble> Yeah it's incorrect. It should be "They came North with I, DIO"
[1:58:58] <HorribleHog> either I, the priest if he is the priest
[1:58:59] <s1rcuit> would it have been accurate in old world texts?
[1:59:07] <hntronium> The priests came north with me
[1:59:07] <WierdDino> Your voice is very good to listen to while i play games, 10/10 would sleep to
[1:59:13] <crusader_heide> they call me the Priests
[1:59:13] <JoeBecomesJoe> Yeah thats just weird
[1:59:13] <HorribleHog> priests and I would be correct yeah
[1:59:33] <scrublordsamurai> its probably supposed to be a rough translation
[1:59:57] <ReNhoSoft1> the priests is just defining who "they" are
[2:00:50] <rabbitective> just read
[2:00:57] <hntronium> I can understand it just fine
[2:01:11] <hntronium> the demon's empire is the final hope
[2:01:13] <TomFrank> Did John Romero write this?
[2:01:16] <rabbitective> ResidentSleeper
[2:01:24] <gsoto83> They don't speak plauge, so...
[2:01:36] <HorribleHog> I don't necessarily enjoy how they're writing doomguy into this deep lore
[2:01:48] <HorribleHog> rabbitective change the channel if you don't like it smh
[2:02:02] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Boss guy was told to send Slayer and his bros to win a fight. lol it was a trap. Boss guy is mad at himself.
[2:02:03] <hntronium> gargoyles
[2:02:10] <LittleBigQuebec> they got sweet talked into sending Doomguy and a squad of demon slayer in the demon world, leaving them deffence less from something
[2:02:12] <rabbitective> @horriblehog no :)
[2:02:14] <Skeletonmanners> look at those wacky guys
[2:02:28] <+sal00nn> Use flamethrower
[2:02:33] <hntronium> He won't
[2:02:40] <brianthe12th> you wanted gargoyles ye? those are gargoyles
[2:02:40] <hntronium> Until the game makes him
[2:02:50] <otakon17> plagueImoya my precious lungs!
[2:02:58] <TomFrank> i enjoy the cartoony sound effects mixed in
[2:02:59] <jumboiiii> seeing plague have fun is nice
[2:03:19] <Korndogg10> are demon slayers a bunch of other doomguys ?
[2:03:20] <otakon17> Hellknight!
[2:03:20] <Fenlig> There's a cracked wall in this room

[2:03:54] <otakon17> What is THAT
[2:03:54] <JoeBecomesJoe> Mortal combat wolf

[2:04:15] <otakon17> Blood PUnch!
[2:04:17] <+Remnel> the uber fist
[2:04:37] <otakon17> Blood Punch has an AOE
[2:04:44] <cap_bon> Is it true have we finally found Hater Fistenator
[2:04:45] <otakon17> and is good for clearing groups it seems
[2:04:46] <hntronium> You're still resorting to glory kills to use this
[2:04:48] <Chatterbox1991> Are you enjoying the game, Plague?
[2:04:49] <+sal00nn> e
[2:04:51] <+arancet> BP meter is above armor
[2:04:52] <otakon17> Lower left
[2:04:54] <+justianxix> bottom left
[2:04:54] <otakon17> above the armor
[2:04:55] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Above armor
[2:04:56] <Fenlig> Over the heatlt
[2:04:57] <hntronium> Keep glory kiling
[2:04:58] <Whyverns> over your armor
[2:05:00] <LittleBigQuebec> right above armor
[2:05:04] <+justianxix> above health
[2:05:09] <+sal00nn> Middle Left?
[2:05:10] <Whyverns> the fist
[2:05:10] <+arancet> jsut above armor
[2:05:13] <Amardeux> not like this
[2:05:14] <otakon17> Lower LEFT Plague
[2:05:17] <twenty112> Above armor, bottom left
[2:05:17] <+corrosivePaladin> the icon isnt there yet
[2:05:31] <rabbitective> i dont think he reads the chat
[2:05:31] <hypersongi> its a new bar. fill all the vidya bars
[2:05:34] <Amardeux> the icon is there
[2:05:37] <+sal00nn> Aoe Punch?
[2:05:38] <Amardeux> lower left
[2:05:39] <otakon17> it is there it's just faint
[2:05:47] <otakon17> it takes TWO glory kills to charge it
[2:05:59] <otakon17> go back up
[2:06:03] <Amardeux> the blood punch icon is above your armor @PlagueOfGripes
[2:06:04] <otakon17> drop from above i seems
[2:06:05] <+Remnel> I love a big helmet that just says 1up above it
[2:06:28] <+JailShmixRemix> Don't tell plague where it is chat, its funnier that way
[2:06:41] <otakon17> The bars in the top right I think are secrets and the like you find
[2:06:55] <otakon17> you are a cruel Jail
[2:06:58] <Korndogg10> flame belch seems op
[2:07:05] <otakon17> he'll unstun
[2:07:13] <otakon17> now PUNCH HIM
[2:07:16] <cap_bon> Slowly turning into a sigil fighter hud
[2:07:16] <+sal00nn> You'll need that magnet upgrade, notice how armor doesn't fly to you?
[2:07:18] <+JailShmixRemix> @otakon17 thank you
[2:07:19] <hntronium> Flame belch is as essential as glory kills
[2:07:23] <otakon17> they'll die eventually
[2:07:35] <otakon17> RUNES! that enhance abilities
[2:07:39] <hntronium> There's at least 2 more systems
[2:07:57] <otakon17> THAT ONE seems good
[2:08:01] <otakon17> the long range GLory Kill
[2:08:09] <hntronium> The long range one is good
[2:08:09] <otakon17> Dazed seems good too
[2:08:17] <hntronium> It even works on enemies in the air
[2:08:20] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:08:25] <otakon17> thank you Nightbot
[2:08:27] <hntronium> Not right now
[2:08:45] <otakon17> Equipment Fiend and Saving THrow seem like really good ones
[2:08:49] <hntronium> They're all useful
[2:08:54] <otakon17> along with long range Glory Kills
[2:09:16] <Cyral_Drive> well that one is only useful once then you have to die
[2:09:34] <cap_bon> this game not nearly as mentally draining as Baba
[2:09:56] <otakon17> you only have 3 slots though
[2:10:16] <hntronium> He found it by accident
[2:10:27] <hntronium> It resets
[2:10:41] <otakon17> okay enter button I need you to START working
[2:11:05] <scrublordsamurai> spank me harder doom daddy!
[2:11:20] <Korndogg10> your just permanently going to have armour from now on LUL
[2:11:30] <hntronium> Find out later
[2:11:55] <+BurningLlama777> Fun Fact: I work at a grocery store and they gave me a flamethrower to guard the toilet paper.
[2:12:01] <Amardeux> oh you need to kill the guys you set on fire to get the fast recharge
[2:12:08] <otakon17> Blood PUnch!
[2:12:08] <Amardeux> for your flame belch
[2:12:18] <hntronium> @Korndogg10 You underestimate the enemy
[2:12:24] <walnut225> It seems very overwhelming on the sheer amount of things you end up getting
[2:12:31] <+sal00nn> Use Flame Belch
[2:12:48] <brianthe12th> is it me or are the hellknights smaller now
[2:12:51] <otakon17> turn around Plague!
[2:12:52] <+sal00nn> Other way
[2:12:53] <Jimevera> it doesnt help that they removed the inf ammo pistol as a fallback weapon
[2:12:54] <+zapper1234566> Other way
[2:12:59] <otakon17> they go the other way
[2:13:04] <+arancet> what IS it?
[2:13:04] <+TQuick101> that's some weird platforming for a FPS
[2:13:05] <hntronium> use your brain
[2:13:15] <+NormenKD> other way around looks closer
[2:13:16] <+zapper1234566> counterclockwise
[2:13:20] <otakon17> you go in a circle going UP
[2:13:20] <rabbitective> plague...your ape brain is wonderful
[2:14:05] <+TQuick101> lul
[2:14:10] <hntronium> LUL
[2:14:16] <otakon17> SEKRIT!
[2:14:28] <+NormenKD> that was it :)
[2:14:29] <Fenlig> full healthy and armor
[2:14:43] <cap_bon> The layout of these levels is waaay more video game than 2016
[2:14:50] <hntronium> Just use the sticky grenades
[2:14:57] <+JailShmixRemix> How has the soundtrack been so far chat?
[2:15:13] <ahaegotrigger> its good
[2:15:28] <otakon17> BLOOD PUNCH!
[2:15:36] <+Vestillion> you know what I think of when I think of DOOM? jumping puzzles. that's what comes to mind.
[2:15:37] <rabbitective> you can barely hear the ost
[2:15:49] <hntronium> You'd use a grenade for that because you're not smart enough to use a sticky grenade
[2:15:52] <otakon17> you'll get the rhythm eventually
[2:15:53] <cap_bon> so many systems to keep track off
[2:16:19] <brianthe12th> nice jumpshot
[2:16:21] <hntronium> Good, the game's doing its job
[2:16:22] <alphonseisbest> button mash fps to win
[2:16:27] <mizamar> !timeout @hntronium
[2:16:29] <ahaegotrigger> heh lighting enemies on fire is fun
[2:16:44] <TehMud> Good lord I am sick of the COD ads I just wanna watch the peoples while stuck at home.
[2:17:01] <donaghy> You can only destroy the weak point once
[2:17:10] <Amardeux> VIDEO GAMESSS
[2:17:11] <Amardeux> LUL
[2:17:17] <+JailShmixRemix> NOT ENOUGH MECHANICS
[2:17:17] <brianthe12th> there was a barrel right next to him you gotta keep those in mind
[2:17:17] <universaldove> Then you destroy the STRONG POINTS
[2:17:18] <+theobble> THE GOUGI SYSTEM
[2:17:23] <Fenlig> And it will all be on a the test!
[2:17:26] <otakon17> Weapon Mod boost
[2:17:32] <rabbitective> BibleThump please,please no more systems-plague 2020
[2:17:34] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Needs a Fingerless Glove meter
[2:17:35] <cap_bon> Doom: Sigil Edition
[2:17:37] <Korgororo> genuine question does plague like video games because I think he hates them all LUL
[2:17:47] <hntronium> Well, you were asking what those things were for earlier, you're getting the explanations now
[2:17:47] <Chatterbox1991> Do you not like the feature creep, plague?
[2:17:49] <+Pixel_Matt> NO SHUT UP THERE'S NO TIME! VIDEOGAME!
[2:17:52] <crusader_heide> @PowerfulBlackGangs Yes
[2:17:54] <otakon17> >Sticky Bombs
[2:17:56] <brianthe12th> that weapon point thing looks the same as 2016's, just more colors
[2:17:57] <TehMud> I've been playing Nioh 2 all week this has nothing on me :P
[2:18:05] <+Heart0fInk> is there a pizza skin like Halo 5?
[2:18:14] <+Vestillion> DOOM 2016 was beautiful in its simplicity. this game is bloated and too quake-y
[2:18:29] <otakon17> there does seem like a LOT of going on
[2:18:31] <Skeletonmanners> this is like a jrpg almost with how many systems this has
[2:18:40] <rabbitective> fupooDaisy poor plague, his brain is running out of space
[2:18:41] <otakon17> i love it
[2:18:43] <otakon17> MORE RPGS
[2:18:53] <hntronium> Its not that hard to take in
[2:19:10] <crusader_heide> no shut up tho
[2:19:14] <HorribleHog> I don't mind the added mechanics, the presentation is a lot less honed
[2:19:19] <alphonseisbest> plague having a boomer moment LUL
[2:19:34] <rabbitective> is real boomer hours
[2:20:01] <Korgororo> chat what's one of plagues favorite games?
[2:20:19] <HorribleHog> It's hilarious to me that the amount of upgrade-points you have is faded out in the screen you most need to see them
[2:20:45] <alphonseisbest> back to zoomer plague
[2:20:52] <otakon17> You have Equipment
[2:20:55] <otakon17> And Weapons
[2:20:55] <brianthe12th> the UI icons and bars are a bit too small
[2:21:04] <hntronium> The grenade that grenades
[2:21:08] <awalr> the UI design in general doesn't seem as good as in 2016
[2:21:12] <Chatterbox1991> this feels like Pete Hines told people MORE GUNS
[2:21:19] <hntronium> YOu're right, the UI is even better
[2:21:25] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Also BLUD Fist
[2:21:35] <Amardeux> dont forget about your blood punch
[2:21:39] <rabbitective> only 2 weapons
[2:21:42] <Amardeux> the icon above your armor
[2:21:42] <brianthe12th> is there an option to make those icons bigger
[2:21:46] <+Vestillion> This UI is ugly as sin
[2:21:51] <Cyral_Drive> This is more arcadey than 2016
[2:22:03] <alphonseisbest> the Ui is fine
[2:22:10] <+Vestillion> I don't like the pastel green and orange color scheme, it's garish
[2:22:12] <alphonseisbest> not great just fine
[2:22:17] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes doubles damage and gives an aoe to each melee.
[2:22:25] <Chatterbox1991> you got two guns so far....
[2:22:27] <rabbitective> you can change the color of the ui
[2:22:32] <Korgororo> plagues getting old pvpWhy
[2:22:33] <HorribleHog> it's ok but that's about it, sickly green ugly font
[2:22:42] <alphonseisbest> @vestillion that's doom tho
[2:22:48] <+JailShmixRemix> getting old?
[2:22:51] <Fenlig> I think it should always charge to atleast 1 fuel
[2:23:27] <otakon17> yo
[2:23:33] <otakon17> Pat posted about DOOM Eternal
[2:23:33] <HorribleHog> ah, it's changeable? why?
[2:23:34] <+Vestillion> @alphonseisbest It doesn't have to be that. you don't have to incorporate every aspect of the old games.
[2:23:39] <otakon17> mind if I link it?
[2:23:39] <alphonseisbest> play more gitgud
[2:23:46] <Fenlig> Not yet
[2:23:47] <+sal00nn> No
[2:23:47] <hntronium> can't do that yet
[2:23:54] <otakon17> https://twitter.com/PatStaresAt/status/1241032271706107906?s=20 enjoy
[2:23:57] <Jimevera> (It hurt to try)
[2:24:01] <Whyverns> green is cleared red is another fight
[2:24:12] <+sal00nn> Follow Sif
[2:24:14] <otakon17> "the hangy on thing!"
[2:24:26] <otakon17> scamper!
[2:24:34] <cinless> he climbs like a chubby cat!
[2:24:35] <alphonseisbest> @vestillion if ur gonna change shit why not make a new IP instead then?
[2:24:35] <otakon17> cool knight statue
[2:24:52] <rabbitective> an alien
[2:25:00] <alphonseisbest> kinda
[2:25:01] <hntronium> The big bad night sentinel
[2:25:02] <otakon17> he's LITERALLY CALLED a NIGHT SENTINEL
[2:25:04] <+Vestillion> @alphonseisbest 2016 changed things, but kept the cool things from the old series.
[2:25:24] <rabbitective> his brain is filled with systems
[2:25:27] <HorribleHog> I don't get it. he looks so different from the night sentinels his design clashes
[2:25:42] <+Vestillion> Hell, the UI was mostly blue in '16
[2:25:43] <otakon17> Dude have you tried a controller?
[2:25:51] <HorribleHog> i thought he was just an ally to them but not necessarily related to them in 2016
[2:26:01] <cap_bon> every time the music lowers im afraid a new sub system is being introduced
[2:26:03] <otakon17> I mean, it was probably designed with a controller in mind is all
[2:26:04] <alphonseisbest> @vestillion but they kept the iconic stuff, colours are iconic imo
[2:26:16] <otakon17> punch the chains!
[2:26:31] <+arancet> its a.... (drumroll please) NEW MECHANIC!
[2:26:32] <otakon17> the running man is YOUS
[2:26:34] <ovan20> if violence didn't fixed the problem, you didn't applied enough of it LUL
[2:26:34] <+sal00nn> Missed codex
[2:26:40] <Amardeux> rip that codex LUL
[2:26:40] <awalr> yeah I like how they just merged the use and melee button
[2:26:44] <ovan20> LUL
[2:26:44] <donaghy> LUL
[2:26:44] <otakon17> it's a powerup! you got a DASH
[2:26:49] <+Vestillion> @alphonseisbest and yet the game is mostly blue, while this game is ugly and pastel. explain.
[2:26:49] <BlacSoul> DODGE
[2:26:50] <alphonseisbest> LUL
[2:26:50] <+justianxix> Trickster time
[2:26:54] <otakon17> Doomslayer is goddamn MEGAMAN X
[2:27:00] <+sal00nn> Dash
[2:27:04] <otakon17> you got special weapons, and a dash and a WALL CLIMB
[2:27:08] <+JailShmixRemix> Dooman X
[2:27:18] <otakon17> Doom Man X!
[2:27:38] <HorribleHog> Mega Man X -> Doom Guy X
[2:27:40] <+Heart0fInk> Run Ruined!
[2:27:41] <Whyverns> you can still get it
[2:27:45] <awalr> if only you had some sort of dashing mechanic
[2:27:49] <$SGrim> @PlagueOfGripes you can go back up the way you came, then dash across the gap
[2:27:52] <alphonseisbest> @vestillion did we play the same game? 2016 was almost always orange, tothe point it got on my nerves
[2:27:55] <Whyverns> just jump on the box
[2:28:00] <otakon17> no
[2:28:03] <otakon17> that's your Blood PUnch
[2:28:04] <+arancet> thats the punch
[2:28:13] <otakon17> the segmented outline is how many charges
[2:28:22] <+Vestillion> @alphonseisbest the atmosphere is orangey-red. the UI is near universally blue.
[2:28:44] <rabbitective> ape brain moment

[2:30:12] <baronvonbirman> Chat, giving directional advice in a fps is close to pointless
[2:30:13] <HelghastTroop> is this the part where eli becomes a secret hunting goblin
[2:30:28] <ÊÆ∫ÂÆ≥ËÄÖ> I love watching dumbass backseaters heads explode ohnLUL

[2:31:09] <+Heart0fInk> That's why these emotes exist BabyRage brownBACKSEAT
[2:31:17] <coldarmracer> that map is cool
[2:31:20] <otakon17> Can you change direction midair?
[2:31:23] <HorribleHog> that's why most streamers don't allow backseating in the first place
[2:31:30] <HelghastTroop> when ever it comes to secrets people will just start yelling the answers
[2:31:34] <alphonseisbest> @vestillion ah the Ui, tho I thought the Ui was white, it's been a bit since i looked2016. I think we gonna have to agree to disagree about it. cuz this seems like silly thing to argue over :)
[2:31:34] <awalr> @otakon17 hell yeah you can
[2:31:36] <otakon17> oho it worked!
[2:31:38] <ÊÆ∫ÂÆ≥ËÄÖ> BabyRage is what I picture a backseater looks like
[2:31:46] <Fenlig> Gotta keep your chin up :D
[2:31:47] <+Heart0fInk> Wow. that worked

[2:32:16] <+JailShmixRemix> Plague stopping me from backseating? where else am i supposed to sit doodSad
[2:32:19] <ReNhoSoft1> Are you liking this more than the Doom 2016? If you liked that one to begin with
[2:32:24] <otakon17> And the violence is SEX
[2:32:24] <HelghastTroop> the ocd in poeple will erupt when someone oesnt do it the perfect way
[2:32:24] <Korgororo> "sick hops bro" FrankerZ
[2:32:24] <theredfox930000> plague you playing this on pc
[2:32:30] <otakon17> he is
[2:32:31] <cap_bon> Local ghost goes awoo
[2:32:42] <otakon17> God DoomSlayer is so chonky
[2:32:42] <rabbitective> @jailshmixremix in the front :)
[2:32:42] <awalr> backseaters get put in the trunk
[2:32:43] <+Vestillion> @alphonseisbest I swapped mine to red, and it's almost passable.
[2:32:44] <theman630> tomatoGrease sexy demons
[2:32:51] <+Heart0fInk> they're probably into butt stuff
[2:32:54] <otakon17> he don't care
[2:32:59] <otakon17> he gonna take it anyway
[2:33:02] <digsby> I think this is the level that opens up a very nice quality of life feature near the end. I wouldn't sweat missing secrets.
[2:33:17] <otakon17> DOOMSLAYER KNEELED?!
[2:33:19] <Chatterbox1991> @PlagueOfGripes please dont get down on stuff, plague, we all love you for what you do! :)
[2:33:27] <otakon17> what Chatterbox said
[2:33:31] <HorribleHog> nice beard
[2:33:36] <Ageingyoungrebel> lore LUL
[2:33:37] <HorribleHog> how much glue did you use
[2:33:37] <otakon17> Apparently this is SUPPOSED to happen
[2:33:40] <otakon17> and if you fiddle with it
[2:33:46] <HorribleHog> lore laeKEK
[2:33:48] <otakon17> Heaven is gonna hop in
[2:33:52] <Korndogg10> bruh
[2:33:55] <Korndogg10> what
[2:33:59] <HelghastTroop> so whats the headcannon on what doom slayer is
[2:34:00] <otakon17> and apparently Heaven is a bigger threat than Hell
[2:34:07] <cap_bon> The virgin ghost vs the chad slayer
[2:34:08] <digsby> Super weird that it cuts away from first person in this game.
[2:34:12] <BlacSoul> Time to BODY THE HEAVENS
[2:34:12] <Korgororo> it's not killing the other party LUL
[2:34:22] <otakon17> I want to make a prediction
[2:34:22] <+Heart0fInk> I keeps seeing it as Novak
[2:34:23] <ReNhoSoft1> Ive always been torn on the idea of having actual lore in a doom game
[2:34:24] <Vemok> That is not the dragon way, some holes should remain unfilled
[2:34:27] <otakon17> you fight HEAVEN eventually
[2:34:28] <+Heart0fInk> yes
[2:34:37] <Fraudbear> wait there's story on this shit
[2:34:38] <otakon17> You're an alien FROM the past
[2:35:01] <HelghastTroop> hes a ghost from christmas past of robotic future
[2:35:01] <ReNhoSoft1> Heaven you say? is doom guy bayonettas cousin now? Kappa
[2:35:13] <mizamar> stop spoiling lmao
[2:35:22] <otakon17> yeah, the Night Sentinels fought Hell and kept them in check, one of their own betrayed the order so Hell would bring back his dead son. Hell betrayed him and he in turn became THE DOOMSLAYER
[2:35:31] <otakon17> I'm not spoiling I'm guessing.
[2:35:37] <otakon17> I haven't played this
[2:35:44] <+justianxix> Isn't that stuff from Doom 2016
[2:35:46] <Korndogg10> sound like adeptus astartes
[2:35:47] <otakon17> yeah
[2:35:49] <Allrthur> space spartans
[2:35:50] <digsby> You're reading the Doom 2016 pretty much
[2:35:51] <otakon17> this is the sequel
[2:35:54] <Jimevera> thats weak compared to mad about dead rabbit
[2:35:56] <ReNhoSoft1> wait what
[2:36:01] <+Remnel> It's a good thing doom guy knows all this
[2:36:02] <Whyverns> no the betrayer is another dude
[2:36:05] <+Lost_Zombie> I mean the rabbit is in the game
[2:36:06] <otakon17> no
[2:36:08] <Whyverns> he made the slayers armor
[2:36:08] <kingra> It's implied but also there's stuff later on that impies otherwise
[2:36:09] <Tucker0603> SPESE MAHRINES!!!
[2:36:09] <otakon17> you're the Betrayer
[2:36:14] <JayCantDo> technoviking?
[2:36:14] <+theobble> I liked it better when he was just so0me random asshole
[2:36:28] <otakon17> and now ELECTRIC floor
[2:36:36] <ReNhoSoft1> right? just a random dude doing his best to close the gates of hell, that was good enough lore for me
[2:36:37] <otakon17> *splat*
[2:36:43] <alphonseisbest> your not the betrayer @otakon17
[2:37:00] <Jimevera> all this lofty nonsense about being the DoomSlayer tm bogs it down
[2:37:06] <HelghastTroop> the slayer should just have a bag of marbles to just throw on the floor
[2:37:16] <otakon17> I'm gonna go double check I swear you are, you betrayed the Night Sentinels to help Hell so they'd bring your son back to life and they punked your ass.
[2:37:19] <HelghastTroop> doom guy is basic kevin mcallister
[2:37:30] <otakon17> man Hellknights in this one are NO joke
[2:37:36] <+sal00nn> Flqme Belch
[2:37:58] <alphonseisbest> @otakon17 thats not u, that's the rival character in this
[2:38:06] <rabbitective> @otakon17 i have no idea where you got that lore, the slayer is not the betrayer
[2:38:33] <KUYAmoPESh> I thought Doom guy was 100% human, does he have a sentinel blood in him?
[2:38:41] <+corrosivePaladin> I love the little pop it makes when you rip ou ttheir eye
[2:38:58] <+Lost_Zombie> figured doom guy got adopted by the sentinels and thats why he still cares about humans
[2:39:05] <rabbitective> the slayer is a sentinel
[2:39:06] <alphonseisbest> @kuyamopesh he was pure human then LORE happened
[2:39:16] <KUYAmoPESh> figures lol
[2:39:17] <+corrosivePaladin> I noticed with only eternal that the back key will start ghosting and wont let you backpedal
[2:39:25] <+theobble> Doomtroid Prime
[2:39:28] <+Remnel> What you mean like destiny
[2:39:30] <+justianxix> The dude from the original doom and 2016 are different people
[2:39:31] <rabbitective> 2016 is a hard reboot
[2:39:34] <TheAsylumCat> so basically DMC logic
[2:39:34] <otakon17> ah, you're right I was wrong.
[2:40:28] <otakon17> Doom Marine is not Doom Slayer but IS referenced
[2:40:30] <+LiquidDinosaur> IS DOOMGUY LINK
[2:40:38] <otakon17> ...yes
[2:40:39] <rabbitective> they dont, its a reboot
[2:40:43] <+corrosivePaladin> Why cant doomguy crawl?
[2:40:49] <+LiquidDinosaur> or like, the same thing as link/Ganon/Zelda
[2:40:50] <otakon17> he's too dummy thicc
[2:41:05] <+LiquidDinosaur> he also doesnt talk
[2:41:06] <+Remnel> Doomguy can't crawl because he kneels to no authority
[2:41:14] <+corrosivePaladin> hate that youve said that because now im thinking of that bareass doomguy
[2:41:16] <otakon17> except he JUST DID earlier
[2:41:22] <rabbitective> LUL
[2:41:23] <+LiquidDinosaur> bareass doomguy?
[2:41:27] <HelghastTroop> eli and his embarrassing failures will surely lead him to a desired outcome
[2:41:34] <otakon17> You can do it Plague!
[2:41:41] <+LiquidDinosaur> wait he talks? i was afk
[2:41:43] <otakon17> nah
[2:41:45] <otakon17> he emotes
[2:41:58] <Essixian> IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH
[2:41:58] <+TopTieramisu> rawr
[2:41:59] <+justianxix> Doggo
[2:42:11] <Blazeofflame> that's a resident evil dog
[2:42:13] <LtSolo> Argentina legends
[2:42:14] <otakon17> THE WOLF
[2:42:15] <HelghastTroop> thats a resident evil dog if ive seen one
[2:42:16] <Essixian> It's a good boi cuppyLove
[2:42:20] <otakon17> Sentinel Beast
[2:42:25] <+LiquidDinosaur> is the Doom Comic canon
[2:42:25] <otakon17> the bestest boy
[2:42:30] <+jetjagger222> ghost dog
[2:42:31] <Korndogg10> space wolfs
[2:42:43] <rabbitective> Mine-the sentinels
[2:42:46] <otakon17> tell me you get a goddamn space wolf to use in combat
[2:42:49] <Essixian> @LiquidDinosaur I refuse to believe it isn't
[2:42:49] <ovan20> good bois
[2:42:54] <jiin6> they were goodest of boys
[2:42:55] <otakon17> just summon a pack of space wolves
[2:43:16] <otakon17> that flat wee gets me to giggling everytime
[2:43:17] <+jetjagger222> himitsu ga shiritai
[2:43:25] <awalr> from inside
[2:43:29] <+sal00nn> Yup
[2:43:32] <rabbitective> ape brain moment
[2:43:39] <+sal00nn> Just don't think about it
[2:43:47] <+LiquidDinosaur> oh shit
[2:43:50] <Fenlig> But now with dash
[2:43:50] <+LiquidDinosaur> OH SHIT. HUGE GUTS.
[2:43:54] <+jetjagger222> dash preserves height
[2:43:55] <otakon17> you're atht etop fo the rampe
[2:44:01] <+Saggitori> you can
[2:44:11] <otakon17> double dash to it from the top stair?
[2:44:21] <+sal00nn> Do it
[2:44:24] <coldarmracer> realism
[2:44:27] <HelghastTroop> plague doesnt like tomb raider as an fps
[2:44:30] <+corrosivePaladin> pogonaPeek
[2:44:43] <+TQuick101> Survive
[2:44:44] <otakon17> but they give a WEAPON POINT
[2:44:54] <otakon17> I say go for it!
[2:44:55] <Skeletonmanners> i love the stupid gulp noise
[2:45:13] <Essixian> You need to fire grenades into both of their mouths, then glory kill from one to the other in mid-air.
[2:45:18] <otakon17> kill the Cacodemons?
[2:45:31] <otakon17> suddenly gun
[2:45:37] <otakon17> Plasma Rifle acquired!
[2:45:44] <Skeletonmanners> here he is
[2:45:45] <otakon17> and it even LOOKS like the old style one
[2:45:46] <Skeletonmanners> the meme bone man
[2:45:54] <+corrosivePaladin> yea the secret encounters are really weird. dont like them
[2:45:58] <Essixian> DOOT
[2:46:03] <HelghastTroop> revnant lore is lets strap some fuckin kickass rocket launchers on corpse
[2:46:03] <+jetjagger222> it helps vs hordes because everything is extra aggressive
[2:46:05] <otakon17> Tis DOOT!
[2:46:16] <rabbitective> whag?
[2:46:25] <alphonseisbest> I thought woolie loved it
[2:46:30] <Skeletonmanners> yea everyone just used gauss cannon instead cuz it uses the same ammo type
[2:46:36] <Essixian> I think so, the Eternal version seems better though. More powerful, better mods, and it can overload shields to make them explode.
[2:46:39] <ovan20> the sound of the weapons continues to be shit LUL
[2:46:47] <BlacSoul> Woolie liked Gauss Siege
[2:46:52] <otakon17> I would be as well
[2:46:56] <alphonseisbest> ah
[2:46:57] <+jetjagger222> everyone liked gauss-chan
[2:47:15] <awalr> they changed how it feels and functions a lot, it's great in eternal
[2:47:20] <rabbitective> fupooDaisy you are so bad
[2:47:23] <N1netbattler> how do you like Eternal compared to 2016?
[2:47:27] <+sal00nn> ... Maybe get the other rune next time
[2:47:46] <otakon17> yeah you seem to die REALLY goddamn quickly in this
[2:47:53] <TheAsylumCat> 2016 was straight forward
[2:47:57] <+Saggitori> dorbLove
[2:48:03] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:48:25] <+jetjagger222> its not as elegant as 2016; it feels very "gamey" in this
[2:48:32] <otakon17> the higher difficulties push your reflexes to the max
[2:48:52] <BlacSoul> thats TOO much red
[2:49:05] <TheAsylumCat> I feel I'd HAVE to play this on pc
[2:49:08] <Jimevera> the red vignette for low health is awful
[2:49:25] <+corrosivePaladin> on ultra im bouncing from 10hp to max constantly
[2:49:28] <theaudacityofthisb> Eli did you beat doom 2016?
[2:49:42] <+sal00nn> Maybe as an opener?
[2:49:59] <Essixian> The grenade's for crowds of weak enemies, basically.
[2:49:59] <+jetjagger222> it reaches a bit of a better stride once you get your third weapon
[2:50:05] <alphonseisbest> @jetjagger222 but that's what the devs where going 4
[2:50:18] <+jetjagger222> exactly and i don't like it as much
[2:50:31] <+jetjagger222> there's a punchable box up top
[2:50:34] <+arancet> check map
[2:50:59] <+corrosivePaladin> hey now dont backseat secrets
[2:51:08] <Skeletonmanners> it blends in
[2:51:17] <Skeletonmanners> you unlock everything and see everything but theres still like 4 levels left
[2:51:20] <alphonseisbest> @jetjagger222 yeah it might be a case of dev made game for themselves and not for fans of 2016 ya know?
[2:51:23] <RothurThePaladin> LUL
[2:51:25] <%Gogogolem> This what noise?
[2:51:43] <+TQuick101> Woolie would be excited about that
[2:51:54] <awalr> I'm not necessarily on board with every single design decision in eternal but I really like how they're willing to just go nuts
[2:51:57] <+sal00nn> Poison?
[2:51:58] <otakon17> you got a Soundtrack item!
[2:52:00] <+justianxix> I prefer the Gameyness of this game
[2:52:07] <+jetjagger222> @alphonseisbest its just my opinion, clearly its working well for a lot of people so good on them
[2:52:12] <SuperVaderMan> ah, the hallway of guts
[2:52:13] <+LiquidDinosaur> i think it could be like, 10% less gamey?
[2:52:14] <Essixian> WELCOME TO VORETOWN
[2:52:24] <otakon17> yeah I don't trust that muck
[2:52:39] <Lutre> tentacle vomitorium
[2:52:40] <otakon17> huh
[2:52:42] <otakon17> SAME
[2:52:57] <+sal00nn> Keep going
[2:53:16] <otakon17> super sticky
[2:53:16] <+jetjagger222> that's very similar to the zerg color scheme
[2:53:27] <otakon17> yeah I think you need to keep following the sticky trail
[2:53:30] <+sal00nn> Follow the path?
[2:53:42] <rabbitective> ResidentSleeper
[2:53:47] <Lutre> does it circle back on the map?
[2:53:49] <+arancet> there is no solution from here
[2:53:51] <otakon17> *facepalms*
[2:54:25] <+arancet> lol
[2:54:29] <otakon17> i love the gore effects
[2:54:45] <Blazeofflame> but F is for flashlight
[2:54:47] <otakon17> that monsters have actual damage models is great
[2:55:05] <kingra> F
[2:55:11] <bearalin> Wow this is a cute game. Very colorful.
[2:55:17] <otakon17> Doomguy SMASH
[2:55:22] <Tucker0603> hey, I love the plasma rifle
[2:55:29] <+jetjagger222> @bearalin the visual design is similar to quake 3
[2:55:31] <+arancet> demon models take more Real Battle Damage than my jurassic park toys
[2:55:31] <Essixian> They made the heat blast more powerful and increased its range. It's neat.
[2:55:34] <TehMud> Wait Melee is the same as use key now? I don't know if I can handle that... well when I have money to buy the game anyway.
[2:55:40] <SuperVaderMan> So it locks onto them?
[2:55:43] <+sal00nn> Useful CC
[2:55:45] <+aspirationdeath> its way stronger here and its necessary against some enemies
[2:55:46] <+jetjagger222> yeah it stuns and locks
[2:56:08] <+UnwoundCaesar70> I feel the gun people disliked the most was the pistol since it didn't come back
[2:56:19] <Tucker0603> poor plasma rifle
[2:56:31] <BlacSoul> ?
[2:56:38] <Essixian> Pat did it by dashing straight back :P
[2:56:59] <RothurThePaladin> not the ants!
[2:57:01] <otakon17> wait you can dash BACKWARDS?!
[2:57:20] <awalr> punchables are green
[2:57:22] <Essixian> Oh yeah.
[2:57:35] <otakon17> Your fist is not big enough
[2:57:38] <otakon17> you need
[2:57:41] <otakon17> THE BIGGEST FIST
[2:58:07] <otakon17> >random statue of a hand
[2:58:17] <+CarlosEoM> doom gremlin
[2:58:20] <+Taglog7> pearl
[2:58:20] <otakon17> Plague I think you need a break man
[2:58:27] <otakon17> scamper scamper
[2:59:31] <otakon17> oh hey theater mode is WAY better
[3:00:12] <alphonseisbest> is this lore 4 the demon, lime their backstory?
[3:00:14] <TehMud> I forgot DOOM had all this lore
[3:00:31] <TehMud> I just remember pew pew demon die
[3:00:45] <Essixian> This is all new.
[3:01:14] <+Taglog7> but that's a theory
[3:01:19] <Tucker0603> makyr shit is all new
[3:01:21] <SuperVaderMan> they pay lip service to the idea of a timeline, but every game is its own thing
[3:01:26] <TehMud> @Essixian Oh yeah I meant from DOOM 2016. I didn't actually read it like a fool
[3:01:27] <coldarmracer> SPOILER
[3:01:34] <Essixian> They've actually said that EVERY Doom game and WAD is canon. Every single one. Including fanmade ones. Including Chex Quest. LUL
[3:02:23] <otakon17> so basically
[3:02:29] <otakon17> time parallels
[3:02:44] <+LiquidDinosaur> the best timeline is the non-canon Zelda timeline where the timeline forks into Super Smash Bros, the CDI games, and Tingle's spinoffs. the timeline branching point is "does Link win Soul Calibur 2"
[3:02:45] <otakon17> plagueFace I now have the bEST emote
[3:02:57] <jiin6> it made thing glow
[3:03:05] <Tucker0603> chilledRex chilledRex chilledRex
[3:03:07] <jiin6> and then it go bye bye
[3:03:21] <+sal00nn> Up?
[3:03:31] <otakon17> punch wall!
[3:03:39] <otakon17> you missed a punch wall I think?
[3:03:43] <fluffy_sauce> lower ledge, on the wall?
[3:03:46] <otakon17> yeah
[3:03:48] <otakon17> looked like it
[3:04:04] <fluffy_sauce> crack in the wall
[3:04:10] <fluffy_sauce> on the lower ledge
[3:04:10] <rabbitective> plague i think you are blind
[3:04:24] <jaxondorf> cheer200 tell us about the spicy Pebble you saved
[3:04:35] <+Oprender> there was a crack in the wall
[3:04:37] <+Oprender> down there
[3:05:06] <otakon17> THE SMOLLEST LAD
[3:05:11] <otakon17> Please
[3:05:20] <otakon17> Please survive Chomper Shell
[3:05:33] <otakon17> >enjoying the outdoors
[3:05:36] <otakon17> burn the heretic!
[3:05:37] <rabbitective> blind
[3:05:47] <otakon17> They were works too I think
[3:05:49] <AncelDeLambert> now all I have in my head is the Terry Pratchett joke about the turtle learning to fly
[3:06:02] <otakon17> it opens THAT door
[3:06:14] <Jimevera> 6 women have to scream to open the door
[3:06:19] <AncelDeLambert> Do you think if you picked up a turtle and walked him ten feet away, it'd fuck the turtle up for life?
[3:06:21] <Skeletonmanners> doooaaarr
[3:06:22] <Tucker0603> ....wow....
[3:06:25] <otakon17> Doom Door
[3:06:28] <+arancet> very good pun plague, very good
[3:06:34] <AncelDeLambert> like, the turtle now dreams of the few seconds of its life when it could fly
[3:06:35] <otakon17> a...Scream Door
[3:06:37] <otakon17> ugh
[3:06:38] <otakon17> UGH!
[3:06:39] <otakon17> it burns
[3:06:45] <+justianxix> looked like there was a breakable wall down there
[3:06:50] <Tucker0603> you kinda got up a weird way
[3:06:53] <Essixian> LOOK AT THIS METAL SHIT
[3:07:22] <+justianxix> Still Metal
[3:07:24] <Essixian> Nah, that's a different mech.
[3:07:39] <+TQuick101> what, you think we wouldn't mass produce the exact same mech?
[3:07:41] <Tucker0603> there's been a lot of murder Eli, many many murders
[3:07:53] <jiin6> maybe the naughty place is the same as ours? i dunno me dumb
[3:08:00] <bearalin> Pew pew
[3:08:06] <rabbitective> re-using assets, thats crazy, no one does that Kappa
[3:08:25] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:08:44] <+donttellpike> Going for the weak points is pretty vital, especially when there's a bunch of big demons
[3:09:06] <+donttellpike> does he have the scope for the AR?
[3:09:09] <TheDastardlyD> I started on nightmare then babied out when my mouse 4 broke
[3:09:11] <alphonseisbest> @plagueofgripes do u like the danasty warriors games?
[3:09:19] <jiin6> i don't want to fight, i just wanna rip and tear
[3:10:11] <+arancet> this would suck is chainsaw wasnt
[3:10:16] <+Taglog7> cmonBruh
[3:10:31] <baronvonbirman> If Plague and Max had to co-op something then one of them would have an anyeurism and I don't know which one it would be
[3:10:44] <otakon17> seems the best thing to use on the Spider Tanks is Grenades and the Shotty Grenade
[3:11:00] <otakon17> oh hey they have a weakpoint on their ass
[3:11:27] <TheDastardlyD> anger loads bullets into your gun because they know better
[3:12:01] <otakon17> hot damn
[3:12:03] <otakon17> that was nuts
[3:12:29] <Skeletonmanners> yea this game seems exhausting in general too
[3:12:30] <otakon17> eyah I think I would have trouble keeping up with this as well
[3:12:35] <+aspirationdeath> they infinitely spawn resource zombies if there are no chainsawable guys left
[3:12:41] <+arancet> this game is tiring
[3:13:10] <+machinetoys> I do that too
[3:13:27] <+mdstudmuffin> how deep are we in this game?
[3:13:28] <cap_bon> This game needs more sub system bars
[3:13:33] <+arancet> 2nd level
[3:13:38] <+corrosivePaladin> To be fair what if its a secret
[3:13:39] <+donttellpike> there's a jump later on in the mission where I tried for 20 minutes to make a jump that you just walk to after story door
[3:13:47] <+corrosivePaladin> so you gotta try the rocks incase
[3:13:59] <+mdstudmuffin> 3rd level has an insanely hard arena
[3:14:03] <+arancet> @donttellpike i know that exact spot you mean
[3:14:33] <awalr> doom kart double dash
[3:14:41] <otakon17> and now you have DASH PLATFORMING
[3:14:46] <Seatherten> platforming ina doom game
[3:14:49] <Seatherten> >
[3:14:49] <cap_bon> WTF is this fan game platforming shit
[3:14:50] <otakon17> well youd DID say that it got STALE before
[3:14:55] <+donttellpike> @arancet It's the fact it's so almost doable and would think you can mantle it
[3:15:02] <TheDastardlyD> turrets become a lot more manageable with the scope mod
[3:15:14] <otakon17> he's got the Scope mod
[3:15:19] <+arancet> yeah it maddening
[3:15:21] <otakon17> just he never has the time to AIM
[3:15:29] <otakon17> lol
[3:15:30] <+corrosivePaladin> im happy im not the only one that annoyed with the dash refill
[3:15:34] <Seatherten> serious sam tier POP sound
[3:15:36] <TheDastardlyD> I keep pressing 2 because that's what it was in doom 2016
[3:15:37] <+WaywardSera> That little rubbery pop is very satisfying
[3:15:38] <+TheDoctor19901> Doom Guy, the ultimate Jehova Witness
[3:15:43] <awalr> shotgun was on 2 in 2016
[3:15:52] <otakon17> Weapon wheel?
[3:16:06] <+donttellpike> lava
[3:16:09] <+arancet> yellow is lava
[3:16:09] <Seatherten> i find it hilarious that they put so much into movement abbilities and people still have to be slower than in og doom where you just walked without jumping
[3:16:16] <@PatStaresAt> yellow is a colour eli
[3:16:27] <+arancet> also yes
[3:16:33] <+jetjagger222> hey pat
[3:16:41] <Essixian> @Seatherten I mean, in OG Doom you ONLY had horizontal movement.
[3:16:49] <Seatherten> yeah is what i mean
[3:17:00] <Seatherten> and it still felt like you were going faster
[3:17:07] <+donttellpike> it's great for weak points
[3:17:13] <TheDastardlyD> It's actually amazing at taking out weap opoints
[3:17:15] <@PatStaresAt> That sniper thing is super good Eli, it knocks off weakpoints in one shot
[3:17:17] <Essixian> It can one-shot arachnotron and revenant weakpoints.
[3:17:28] <+jetjagger222> that looks exactly like the background of a bunch of mortal kombat 3 stages
[3:17:30] <Varadox> Is that castle floating in the sky the Real Castle Super Beast?
[3:17:36] <Seatherten> veiny bulge
[3:17:37] <Blazeofflame> UwU what's this??
[3:17:38] <+TQuick101> of course you are
[3:17:38] <Seatherten> is this a new fetish
[3:17:48] <alphonseisbest> FUTA demon
[3:17:58] <otakon17> isn't that a heart?
[3:18:11] <+WaywardSera> pepto bismol floor
[3:18:11] <Essixian> Put the thing in the thing, Plague.
[3:18:16] <otakon17> man these levels are ghuge
[3:18:25] <Skeletonmanners> i love that low poly statue on the map
[3:18:29] <awalr> shlorp
[3:18:48] <+WaywardSera> oh yeah jam that throbbing red rod into that demon's squishy bits
[3:19:04] <Seatherten> capri sun looking lava
[3:19:06] <+justianxix> secrets are ? on maps
[3:20:01] <Seatherten> i think you can
[3:20:05] <Seatherten> looks doable
[3:20:06] <+machinetoys> that it's a secret fight
[3:20:36] <UrsaDoom> oh, how far is this into the game?
[3:21:07] <+jetjagger222> dare you enter my magical realm
[3:21:18] <+TQuick101> "congratulations, you defeated them all by denying them!"
[3:21:20] <Skeletonmanners> wouldnt the reward for it make the game easier in the long run tho?
[3:21:25] <Seatherten> i bet you're just scared of a challenge
[3:21:44] <TheDastardlyD> They're at least timed so they can't waste a ton of it
[3:21:49] <Essixian> Man, when Doomguy latches onto walls he does it with AUTHORITY.
[3:21:51] <%kyh9> Animal Crossing looks reall werid this time
[3:22:08] <alphonseisbest> PISS AND CUM
[3:22:10] <RothurThePaladin> yes
[3:22:13] <Blazeofflame> Experimental internet gas?
[3:22:16] <TheDastardlyD> This is what a vagina looks like I'm pretty sure
[3:22:20] <alphonseisbest> nah people still vaping
[3:22:24] <Seatherten> why are this man's guts going trough a mountain
[3:22:24] <TheAsylumCat> yes
[3:22:25] <Rainphoon> they still vape
[3:22:27] <awalr> the children don't know what a health is
[3:22:29] <otakon17> yes
[3:22:40] <+jetjagger222> PHYSICS
[3:22:48] <alphonseisbest> LUL
[3:22:49] <awalr> welcome to bowser's castle
[3:22:51] <+eanscrale> My coworker used to say how much he regretted picking up vaping
[3:22:51] <+justianxix> look at this mario shit
[3:22:55] <Seatherten> super mario tier platforming
[3:22:56] <+JailShmixRemix> sadly
[3:22:58] <otakon17> DAMN
[3:23:01] <otakon17> I did!
[3:23:05] <baronvonbirman> That guy had some DEEP bowels, did you travel through his prolapse?
[3:23:16] <jiin6> hey look its the Purple stuff
[3:23:23] <Essixian> AFAIK, it's gone beyond the "cool kids vape" stage and now it's mostly just a thing people do. Dunno about health effects, I know that the ones with nicotine are bad but the ones without seem pretty safe as long as you don't go too hot and burn your lungs.
[3:23:25] <Seatherten> caco means shit
[3:23:29] <Seatherten> what is a caco demon
[3:23:41] <Essixian> And most vapes are built so that you can't get the vape hot enough for that to happen, so.
[3:23:47] <questionmarktimes2> peepoPooPoo demon
[3:24:20] <UrsaDoom> >build robot legs, but no armor for exposed brain tissue
[3:24:28] <Seatherten> big bonk
[3:24:34] <+WaywardSera> Head pound into the chest cavity
[3:24:34] <alphonseisbest> the head smush
[3:24:35] <jiin6> donk
[3:24:40] <Jimevera> the one that is my favourite I havent seen here yet
[3:24:41] <otakon17> Burn and tear for armor!
[3:24:48] <otakon17> the rib smash
[3:24:49] <lewdskeletor13> The one where he smashes their head into their bosy
[3:24:51] <+donttellpike> the from behind takedowns are pretty sweet
[3:24:52] <questionmarktimes2> wait, is plague playing this with a controller??
[3:24:55] <TheAsylumCat> love the whack a mole one
[3:24:56] <+justianxix> I like the splits
[3:24:56] <Essixian> I think my favorite is that headbonk. Closely followed by the cacodemon eye pull, because it makes that hilarious cartoon PLOP noise.
[3:25:05] <TheDastardlyD> The arm break into bone stab is pretty cool
[3:25:10] <otakon17> the Cacodemon is a fav because of the pop
[3:25:14] <questionmarktimes2> oh
[3:25:16] <+aspirationdeath> fucking up the longnecks is my favorite. their long limbs scream to be dismembered
[3:25:19] <+corrosivePaladin> I love all the cacodemon kills. The pop makes them great
[3:25:57] <TheDastardlyD> I only got it once but I folded a possessed in half like a deck chair
[3:26:03] <alphonseisbest> not into arcade shooters... plays Doom and Warframe...
[3:26:10] <UrsaDoom> with all the platforming, climbing and finishing kill animations, Doom is turning into God of War
[3:26:10] <+donttellpike> yellow pole
[3:26:27] <Jimevera> gotta look at it again
[3:26:32] <lewdskeletor13> I love that when Doomguy isn‚Äôt killing demons he‚Äôs hanging out in his room reading comics and playing guitar. A bloodthirsty dork
[3:26:36] <+ghettomacgyver> Delicious blue goo, smear it on your face!
[3:26:39] <Seatherten> this feels like a tutorial level
[3:26:53] <Seatherten> the fucking key is right next to the lock
[3:27:09] <awalr> it pretty much is still the tutorial
[3:27:16] <Seatherten> god i hope sop
[3:27:22] <baronvonbirman> This is blue shit the game, last game was red shit the game!
[3:27:26] <TheDastardlyD> It gets even shorter don't you worry
[3:27:46] <alphonseisbest> @lewdskeletor13 so is it the comic reading or the guitar playing that's dorky 2 u? cuz only one of these gets the nerd shout
[3:27:48] <otakon17> just double dash to the role!
[3:27:56] <NeenerWiener> With all this verticality and such, this feels more like a mix of like Quake with Doom. It's awesome though.
[3:28:00] <Essixian> It recharges your dashes.
[3:28:00] <+WaywardSera> refills up to 2
[3:28:01] <+donttellpike> recharges it
[3:28:03] <TheDastardlyD> it's a dash replenish I'm pretty sure
[3:28:25] <otakon17> it auto refills your dash bar to full
[3:28:31] <+ghettomacgyver> Ye I was gonna say, Quake is a good analogy to how this plays. But it looks good
[3:28:47] <Seatherten> isnt this one of those games that gives you more ammo the more you use it
[3:28:47] <jestrfestr> now you can spam a flame thrower
[3:28:50] <Seatherten> like RE4
[3:28:56] <+donttellpike> snipe it
[3:29:02] <Seatherten> hoarding is counter productive
[3:29:04] <TheDastardlyD> Not anymore
[3:29:15] <TheDastardlyD> doom 2016 would give you ammo if you were low
[3:29:18] <Essixian> If only you had a scope
[3:29:29] <TheDastardlyD> this one uses the chainsaw for that
[3:29:50] <Seatherten> good to know dastardly
[3:29:56] <lewdskeletor13> @alphonseisbest I don‚Äôt mean dork as a negative. It‚Äôs just a funny mental image
[3:30:00] <alphonseisbest> ego my pregoo
[3:30:17] <Seatherten> translation from ligma sultagenta
[3:30:24] <+WaywardSera> Proper Nouns without context! SwiftRage
[3:30:36] <TheDastardlyD> I miss the demon narrator
[3:30:56] <+Vestillion> I think I'm suffering tonal whiplash
[3:30:56] <Seatherten> is Maykrs a pun about the maker or whatever
[3:30:58] <%13ry4n93> 13ry4n93 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[3:31:03] <Seatherten> this better not be the entire plot line of this game
[3:31:08] <alphonseisbest> @lewdskeletor13 wait what's does the word dork mean to u? cuz its equal to nerd to me, but that might just be my interpretation
[3:31:26] <TheAsylumCat> doomslayer just wanted everyone to get along, via nuclear deterrent
[3:31:43] <Jimevera> Khan? Mongols confirmed aliens
[3:31:45] <lewdskeletor13> Angels: ‚ÄúHey Doomguy stop fucking up the apocalypse please‚Äù

[3:39:57] <Jimevera> vega is just making it up
[3:40:05] <supersugoisenpai1> Guns kind of just throw tiny swords
[3:40:11] <lewdskeletor13> Vega writes fanfic
[3:40:16] <+corrosivePaladin> No wonder doomslayer was the last one alive in the 2016. if they all used melee

[3:41:44] <rabbitective> he fucked up the rest of the sentines?
[3:41:51] <jiin6> Son went to EVIIIL
[3:42:55] <awalr> it's just how demons decorate
[3:42:57] <jiin6> Safety first
[3:42:59] <Jimevera> its like demon batman
[3:43:03] <Essixian> I mean, depends on how long it's been there really.
[3:43:05] <+arancet> its not about the fire, its about sending a message!
[3:43:10] <+LiquidDinosaur> the moon is so fucking boring and disappointing
[3:43:12] <+WaywardSera> Flaming Spiked Chains just REALLY open up the floor plan tho
[3:43:17] <rabbitective> that would be cool
[3:43:19] <PayneBlack> so hell is just a Mario level huh
[3:43:21] <+LiquidDinosaur> Im putting the moon on blast
[3:43:23] <+justianxix> nah, it would be cool
[3:43:24] <TheDastardlyD> A giant mickey mouse projection in the sky
[3:43:32] <Jimevera> when im rich ill buy the moon and paint a sigil on it
[3:43:33] <+penguinlords> they just didnt have the door budget and had flaming chain budget left
[3:43:34] <jiin6> hey look mario shit

[3:43:51] <+WaywardSera> That....has to be intentional
[3:43:51] <jiin6> Doomed mario
[3:43:55] <TheDastardlyD> This is his eternal torment
[3:43:55] <%kyh9> This whole game is just video gamey as hell, it's quaint
[3:43:59] <awalr> the moon would be alright if a full moon was as big as it is in cartoons
[3:44:06] <+arancet> satan just REALLY loves mario maker
[3:44:10] <TheDastardlyD> He chose the path of perpetual torment and spinny fire chains
[3:44:20] <Essixian> PogChamp
[3:44:49] <Skeletonmanners> those flips must be really awkward on controller
[3:44:51] <Wanky_Woop> And your dick is Huge
[3:44:59] <Ageingyoungrebel> not even mildly impressive Kappa
[3:45:15] <rabbitective> you propably love walking simulators
[3:45:43] <+jetjagger222> @Skeletonmanners not as bad as you'd think, but precision aiming is tough at the speed of combat in this game
[3:45:51] <rabbitective> Kreygasm
[3:45:54] <Varadox> Cummy arm.
[3:45:55] <AncelDeLambert> oh thank god a new execution animation
[3:46:05] <+justianxix> power up
[3:46:07] <Blazeofflame> Bees make honey, I make cumey
[3:46:37] <+corrosivePaladin> Plague pls. I cant handle you saying cummy
[3:46:46] <kingbaconcrispy> Holy shit, they really bring it to you, it really is like doom 2.
[3:46:52] <Frog_of_Justic> They wanted a hug, all demons are aggressive huggers
[3:46:54] <+WaywardSera> Cummy is a mistake of the english language
[3:46:56] <rabbitective> what a horny chat this is
[3:46:58] <Daxalog> Seems like Quad Damage
[3:46:58] <Jimevera> it purples you
[3:47:01] <+kiwiredgrave> Ugh does this guy EVER win at video games??? Kappa
[3:47:06] <+cylish> quad dmage
[3:47:08] <TheDastardlyD> Quad damage but not quad damage
[3:47:16] <N1netbattler> cummy hammy AHHHH!!! Kappa
[3:47:47] <Blazeofflame> oh god, I'm gonna, gonna DOOM!
[3:47:57] <+kiwiredgrave> God damn, Hell knights seem SUPER tanky in this game
[3:48:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:48:04] <ComfyFox> imaging being doomslayer and exactly that question goes thru your head while executing demons with a chainsaw "i hope he is a lefty"
[3:48:18] <+Vestillion> All the demons are beefier in this game
[3:48:37] <$mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 How does it feel Seath. to be a BITCH.
[3:48:48] <+Vestillion> I miss punching zambos to death
[3:48:55] <+Vestillion> with basic melee
[3:49:17] <AncelDeLambert> didn't you have the rocket launcher by this point in the 2016 game?
[3:49:51] <awalr> a doom with more melee focus would be rad
[3:49:58] <awalr> mike tyson's doom-out
[3:49:58] <cap_bon> I liked the ruined mechs on earth better
[3:50:04] <+WaywardSera> pacman portal
[3:50:06] <+kiwiredgrave> @awalr thats devil may cry
[3:50:13] <AncelDeLambert> "your combat smelled, feel shame"
[3:50:24] <rabbitective> i mean, you have the chainsaw, the sword, blood punch and glory kills
[3:50:39] <+donttellpike> key is from the slayer gate
[3:50:42] <Skeletonmanners> you should try those optional things Plague, most of them arent harder than normal fights and rewards are worth it
[3:50:45] <TheDastardlyD> key you get from the purple slayer gate things
[3:50:45] <awalr> I guess I just want devil may cry in first person
[3:51:10] <+kiwiredgrave> @awalr thats doom eternal
[3:51:36] <rabbitective> Kappa im too cool for that
[3:51:55] <Skeletonmanners> i don't think those are meant to be obnoxiously hard, just gimmick fights
[3:52:28] <Seatherten> keep on keeping on
[3:52:41] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> is that what you call all those who don't live in america?
[3:52:43] <$doomp12> being a cybrid was fun
[3:52:44] <AncelDeLambert> ... so it's Metroid Prime 3
[3:52:50] <+WaywardSera> Meanwhile! At the Legion of Doom!
[3:53:06] <awalr> shooting is fine but what if all your guns shot fists instead tho
[3:53:07] <$deeschlemp451> deeschlemp451 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:53:17] <jiin6> was that mech game you have vids on youtube?
[3:53:21] <solid_stro> No you must, Plague.
[3:53:25] <N1netbattler> bring a death stranding letter
[3:53:40] <rabbitective> BibleThump dont give me more gameplay
[3:53:44] <+corrosivePaladin> but thats not as cool
[3:53:48] <ComfyFox> "great, more mechanics, i just want my rake and scratch my enemies"
[3:54:01] <Seatherten> "now if enemies are mooving too fast for you to aim here is a freeze gas"
[3:54:27] <+corrosivePaladin> This is starting to feel like metroid prime as Doom but they frontload all the powerups
[3:54:27] <N1netbattler> it's a cold fart
[3:54:28] <+WaywardSera> Can't give the kids ideas on how to freeze shit
[3:54:37] <+kiwiredgrave> the HELLIFIED LUL
[3:54:57] <awalr> he will bite THROUGH the helmet don't ask how
[3:55:01] <jiin6> he hasn't had his apple juice OR his nap

[3:56:26] <Seatherten> textures are hard to tell
[3:56:28] <+kiwiredgrave> a 90's barrel
[3:56:37] <TheDastardlyD> It's a Metal barrel
[3:56:47] <%JailShmixRemix> nicobLove @deeschlemp451
[3:56:56] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> quote that
[3:56:59] <cap_bon> doom slayer shouldnt you be saving earth? "NO where are my toys damnit"
[3:57:01] <N1netbattler> that's the battery slots
[3:57:10] <SuperVaderMan> What's important is that insertions are happening
[3:57:21] <Wanky_Woop> Just wait for him to find the Doomslayer room...
[3:57:43] <Solokaldaka> woopsHey chat

[3:58:13] <TheDastardlyD> Ghost coin
[3:58:13] <Jimevera> coin ghost jail
[3:58:14] <jiin6> token ghost
[3:58:26] <Seatherten> the only way to get a power cell for the robot is to beat your dick to a vegetable
[3:58:31] <TheDastardlyD> Then you slap little timmy
[3:58:33] <Ohshimon> Get in the robot, Shinji
[3:58:36] <+Vestillion> This has no value, because Doomslayer would always get into the robot
[3:58:37] <+arancet> he trained very hard to hold that coin so respect him!
[3:58:41] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> thank you for that insight into your bleak, farmy childhood
[3:58:51] <rabbitective> if we need a coin the ghost can help you
[3:58:59] <+corrosivePaladin> We locked up this ghost because he stole my cool coin
[3:59:14] <Skeletonmanners> tfw you need to send your coin ghost for renovations
[3:59:20] <%deeschlemp451> Ghost emalso implies someone died to spend the rest of forever ylto hold said coin
[3:59:26] <+corrosivePaladin> All these ghosts stealing my gamer coins
[3:59:27] <%deeschlemp451> *also
[3:59:27] <Wanky_Woop> This ghost sucks dick for ghost coins
[3:59:35] <Seatherten> they really like their gates opening
[3:59:41] <+arancet> owls in futurama
[3:59:51] <PayneBlack> this is the room where we keep the replacement coin holding ghosts
[3:59:51] <Seatherten> uhhhhh
[4:00:03] <+Vestillion> It's so dumb
[4:00:05] <Jimevera> haha rip and teear right guys
[4:00:12] <+corrosivePaladin> The demons would leave earth for 5 gamer coins but all these ghosts stole them
[4:00:19] <%deeschlemp451> @arancet why would anyone not have an owl exterminator
[4:00:28] <+kiwiredgrave> that gate opening sound is the EXACT same one as in BloodBorne
[4:00:32] <TheDastardlyD> Punish the naughty demons
[4:00:35] <Seatherten> demon GO
[4:00:41] <alrobot2014> labbing on demons in the demon prison
[4:00:53] <PayneBlack> wow
[4:01:00] <+Vestillion> they literally just put in BFG division
[4:01:03] <PayneBlack> they're just gonna rop bfg just like that
[4:01:05] <TheDastardlyD> Try and snip spider turrets
[4:01:05] <+Vestillion> copy+paste
[4:01:10] <PayneBlack> drop*
[4:01:15] <N1netbattler> there's pop sound lol
[4:01:21] <cap_bon> Division PogChamp
[4:01:26] <+Vestillion> I mean, BFG division is good.
[4:01:33] <+fingalights> This is Doom Guys play room
[4:01:36] <Seatherten> no exit
[4:01:36] <+Razputin217> BFG Division Kreygasm
[4:01:37] <rabbitective> get down there
[4:01:46] <TheDastardlyD> Now YOU'RE the prisoner
[4:01:46] <+Vestillion> KILL! KILL!
[4:01:47] <cinless> it turns out you were the demons all along
[4:01:55] <+corrosivePaladin> I think it said you get upgrade points for doing these
[4:01:56] <jiin6> the music hasn't stopped yet
[4:02:00] <Seatherten> you go trough
[4:02:00] <PayneBlack> you're trapped in here until you prove your pp is huge
[4:02:02] <awalr> you kill the demons
[4:02:06] <+UnkleFrunkle> theres a blue portal you can leave through
[4:02:17] <Daxalog> It did say to exit through the portal to leave. Wheres th eportal?
[4:02:25] <+donttellpike> plasma gun melts enimies
[4:02:34] <+fingalights> Just to watch him die
[4:02:39] <rabbitective> it opens once you killed everything
[4:02:54] <rabbitective> TUTORIAL
[4:02:58] <Seatherten> "now you will have fun, comrade"
[4:03:02] <Skeletonmanners> HERE'S YOU FUN
[4:03:03] <jiin6> Vega: RELAX
[4:03:10] <TheDastardlyD> You had to punish those naughty demons for living in your space fortress
[4:03:11] <+WaywardSera> oh he actually does get the coin
[4:03:12] <+arancet> ANOTHER upgrade mechanic
[4:03:14] <cap_bon> Cant leave until you punish the naughty
[4:03:20] <Jimevera> Please take the coin, doomslayer... set me free...
[4:03:34] <DraxTD> How's the Doom @PlagueOfGripes ?
[4:03:43] <rabbitective> BibleThump no more...no more game
[4:03:53] <+Vestillion> I can't believe they didn't even REMIX BFG division, they just slapped it back in.
[4:04:04] <+corrosivePaladin> Remember when upgrade points were cool? We made them gamer coins instead
[4:04:16] <+WaywardSera> This is what's known in academic circles as the "Chubby Bunny" approach to game design
[4:04:37] <Wanky_Woop> You dont have to customise if you dont want to, you can just shove em... wherever
[4:04:39] <rabbitective> yeah people play the game
[4:04:44] <TheDastardlyD> Ripping and tearing at extremely fast speeds
[4:04:47] <Seatherten> more movement abbilities of magically flying
[4:04:59] <+aspirationdeath> that dash shit is vital on nightmare
[4:06:01] <Jimevera> 3 ghost dollars though
[4:06:08] <+corrosivePaladin> all the exploration stuff has been nice
[4:06:27] <TheDastardlyD> You have to touch those filthy ghost coins though
[4:06:49] <Daxalog> 1 Ghost Coin
[4:06:52] <jdev293> u can skip
[4:06:53] <rabbitective> one ghost coin
[4:07:04] <+kiwiredgrave> the ice has to cool down
[4:07:06] <Daxalog> Papa, may I have a ghost coin?
[4:07:08] <+UnkleFrunkle> you can skip
[4:07:26] <TheDastardlyD> Personally I use ice more
[4:07:52] <+donttellpike> I swear it's still faster than 2016
[4:07:57] <+donttellpike> that was really slow
[4:08:11] <+arancet> ghost gave coin, ghost may eternally rest
[4:08:16] <TheDastardlyD> That coin was getting really heavy
[4:08:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:08:26] <rabbitective> this coin is SO HEAVY
