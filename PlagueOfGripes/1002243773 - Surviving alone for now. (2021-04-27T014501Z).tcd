[0:00:53] <Samex_Comex> Yahoo!
[0:00:57] <Dunmarkh> gamer time
[0:01:25] <Srthunda> Hello
[0:01:34] <artificerjoni> Hey Hey People
[0:01:50] <LunarRemix> Comfy night with Plague
[0:02:10] <causewaybob> Hi Mr.of gripes
[0:02:22] <cap_bon> Local man runs from murderer
[0:02:35] <LunarRemix> That game seems to be exploding
[0:02:44] <+Scevda> Evening Eli, lets see how the frames bless/curse you today.
[0:03:01] <Samex_Comex> I had a root canal done today
[0:03:06] <cap_bon> I remember when this game first came out and it was the one map and murderer feels like an eternity ago
[0:03:25] <+Infernal_Dalek> Surprised to see Plague as survivor and not killer
[0:03:29] <+Scevda> Got my vaccine today.
[0:03:31] <cap_bon> Its outriders good? when you acutally get into the game I mean
[0:03:36] <+walternatorz> are things improving with outriders?
[0:03:48] <+coolbowers> Outriders was fun for a few hours
[0:04:19] <causewaybob> @cap_bon pretty much what plague said it‚Äôs not super great but it‚Äôs gotta a road massage
[0:04:19] <SmellySkell> Saw DBD and had to come, I love this terrible, awful, broken game
[0:04:21] <+Scevda> The demo was likely a more tightly designed vertical slice, ya
[0:04:25] <LunarRemix> About FF7R interviews came out and apparently Nomura wanted to keep it like the original
[0:04:35] <LunarRemix> And the other director wanted the Sephiroth time ghost shit
[0:04:41] <cap_bon> Namora time ghosts woooo
[0:04:50] <+theenigmaticdude> ehh nomuraisms
[0:05:11] <Dayven> ff7 remake had too much padding, and I hated thr arbiters of fate
[0:05:27] <+walternatorz> ME3 was probably the hypest I got for a video game and the ending devestated me
[0:05:28] <+Scevda> Lots of media doing that this past decade ya.
[0:05:59] <SmellySkell> Kate <3
[0:06:15] <cap_bon> I remember fighting Sephiroth on the stage of souls as the climax of the first part, and Briggs sweeping dirt.
[0:06:17] <EderParis> that happened to me after beating breath of the wild
[0:06:17] <Samex_Comex> They should add Nomura ghosts to every remake
[0:06:18] <Arancet> end game scaling on outriders ruined it for me
[0:06:41] <+AnIcedCoffee> I think it was Kitase who wanted to all that crazy shit at the end of ff7r
[0:06:49] <+CursedNobleman> i agree
[0:06:56] <+CursedNobleman> how do you like majoras mask?
[0:07:01] <+Scevda> That "one and done" is what I have for Twilight Princess.
[0:07:05] <TheAntiNihilist> hey Plague I've been watching some Orsen Welles interviews and your voice really reminds me of him
[0:07:11] <Samex_Comex> You found me
[0:07:13] <NetherTable> hey all, really digging the Eli Spyro
[0:07:22] <+Scevda> I REALLY don't want to interact with the shit-kid characters to play the main game again.
[0:07:27] <SmellySkell> Botw? You mean Nintendo Genshin Impact?
[0:07:40] <Ziegsy> Oh wow, spyro looks AMAZING in 4k
[0:07:42] <+CursedNobleman> aye, thats a fair take
[0:07:50] <%CursedNobleman> CursedNobleman subscribed with Prime. 
[0:08:05] <%CursedNobleman> oh, and have some bezos bucks
[0:08:17] <+Scevda> well die while looking fabulous
[0:08:19] <+Smiss_Splattered> you monster
[0:08:27] <+Smiss_Splattered> thats a treasure
[0:08:29] <brokendarktower> throw it into a fire
[0:09:00] <+Scevda> oh, in that case ya might as well use the,
[0:09:04] <$thomassolorio> plaaaaaaaaaauge
[0:09:06] <+AnIcedCoffee> I prestiged my main killers and lost all my anniversary cakes :(
[0:09:09] <Daxalog> Is that a Tron legacy box?
[0:09:37] <+Scevda> btw, shall we expect a dungeon grampa two video? I really enjoyed you tearing up the firs tone.
[0:09:45] <Daxalog> When are they going to add Tron and Master Computer to Dead by Daylight?
[0:09:51] <+GalacticaPhanto> what's the benefits of prestiging a
[0:09:56] <+SkookumHime> skooku2Luv skooku2Luv skooku2Luv
[0:10:02] <$thomassolorio> your thoughts on adding the new resident evil big titty giantess to this game
[0:10:02] <+GalacticaPhanto> * killer or survivor
[0:10:11] <thwak> prestige is just a skin and you have a "higher" chance of getting rare items
[0:10:12] <+PleasantLee> the highlighted players look like a grimey version of wiifit
[0:10:33] <@PeachSaliva> Hey, Eli. You wanna do this solo or may I join you in a bit?
[0:10:35] <+walternatorz> wait, is that ninja?
[0:10:54] <+SkookumHime> Yeah Eli, you want Paige to play too?
[0:10:55] <+Scevda> Evenin' paige
[0:11:02] <+GalacticaPhanto> Paigeeee!!
[0:11:05] <s1rcuit> Plague's head looks photoshopped onto the spyro costume
[0:11:06] <LunarRemix> Apparently you can't stream that anymore
[0:11:33] <$thomassolorio> peach üçë
[0:11:35] <+coolbowers> Peach and plague stream yesssss
[0:11:41] <brokendarktower> cool
[0:11:45] <+Scevda> I hope one day I play the same game as one your guys sometime and have the chance to play with/against them.
[0:11:48] <+walternatorz> @s1rcuit wait, that's a costume? it's so lifelike
[0:11:51] <+rockcentuar> I hope he didnt photshop that dragon
[0:11:53] <$thomassolorio> y√†aaaaaa cross the streams
[0:11:57] <+Infernal_Dalek> I heard rarer stuff shows up more frequently iin blood webs
[0:12:02] <NetherTable> what game do you think has the best "prestige" reward?
[0:12:24] <+Smiss_Splattered> well, that just means you're closer to getting the better perks zubMEG
[0:12:52] <$thomassolorio> plauge peach stream
[0:13:26] <+Scevda> shes here lol
[0:13:39] <+GalacticaPhanto> @plagueofgripes she asked if you wanted to play just now
[0:13:40] <$thomassolorio> peach how could you
[0:13:52] <+walternatorz> paige is soooo inconsiderate
[0:13:54] <@PeachSaliva> You turd! I did not!
[0:13:59] <@PeachSaliva> I had to run an errandn
[0:14:10] <$thomassolorio> lol
[0:14:10] <+SkookumHime> Be nice to Paige
[0:14:10] <+coolbowers> Plagues been Told
[0:14:11] <+ClericOfSparda> LUL
[0:14:13] <@PeachSaliva> I‚Äôll be back online in a sec. I‚Äôll message you.
[0:14:16] <+Scevda> Ooooog
[0:14:16] <@PeachSaliva> Ass!
[0:14:21] <$thomassolorio> why paige whyyyyyyyy
[0:14:28] <+walternatorz> judge eli
[0:14:30] <+Scevda> Good frames today
[0:14:35] <+SkookumHime> How could you be so cruel
[0:14:37] <supergoblinpunch> TRUTH BULLET
[0:14:39] <$thomassolorio> hahahahahahahahahahaha
[0:14:45] <artificerjoni> LUL
[0:14:46] <@PeachSaliva> I literally did not, you stinky baby
[0:14:49] <NetherTable> coordinated throw
[0:14:50] <@PeachSaliva> You smell like wet beef
[0:14:58] <+Scevda> I wonder if part the issue is joining canadian servers or something idk
[0:15:04] <+AnIcedCoffee> Prestiging increases the rate which higher rarity perks appear by about 10% but it's still not super worth the bloodpoint investment unless you just /want/ to prestige
[0:15:05] <%EyeFarted> wet beef?
[0:15:15] <JohnClaggart> i like those ferrets in that video
[0:15:16] <$thomassolorio> the wettest beefs
[0:15:20] <+Dr_DangerPhD> prestiging is basically just flexing that you play the game a lot
[0:15:20] <Dunmarkh> @Scevda she's in merica though
[0:15:26] <+SkookumHime> Stinky baby, yeah
[0:15:41] <+GalacticaPhanto> @peachsaliva Paige we miss you! hopefully everything is going good in the states!
[0:15:46] <$thomassolorio> just tell him nono don't tuck me there that is your nono square
[0:15:56] <+Scevda> wait what? since when? I thought she was engaged also essentially still locked down in montreal due to her health co-morbidities?
[0:16:24] <+Scevda> Doot
[0:16:25] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[0:16:35] <$thomassolorio> that noice is so clown shoes lol
[0:16:36] <sauceboss310> spooky
[0:16:45] <NetherTable> yeah, got to be careful not to make the prestige reward too powerful that it skews gameplay but good enough that people want to do it
[0:16:47] <Dunmarkh> Kreygasm
[0:16:48] <CandyCoatedConfection> LUL
[0:16:52] <%EyeFarted> I'm so weak because of my vagina
[0:16:54] <+Scevda> A lot of the groans are pretty sexual in this
[0:17:01] <Samex_Comex> Hot lever pulling
[0:17:14] <+traximus_s> chat is plague going to continue that game with the bear on stream
[0:17:14] <+Promessa_EX> how is eli
[0:17:25] <$thomassolorio> hahahahahahajajaja
[0:17:26] <sauceboss310> sugoiWoah sugoiWoah
[0:17:30] <+SkookumHime> https://clips.twitch.tv/BeautifulChillyGazelleRiPepperonis--fCvHS4FZmi-yhFm
[0:17:35] <@PeachSaliva> I‚Äôll be back in 5
[0:17:37] <+SkookumHime> best moment of my night
[0:17:49] <+Promessa_EX> yeah plague, you feeling despair?
[0:17:58] <cap_bon> barely even saw the killer
[0:18:06] <+Scevda> first try*
[0:18:07] <+walternatorz> how does it feel to get top score?
[0:18:11] <Genoblader> kpop killer doesn't seem very good tbh
[0:18:11] <Samex_Comex> Number 1 baby!
[0:18:37] <+AnIcedCoffee> They're live
[0:18:38] <+Smiss_Splattered> live
[0:18:47] <$thomassolorio> there should be a giant woman killer
[0:18:58] <$Bigchill___> Pleague time
[0:19:02] <$Bigchill___> Plague too
[0:19:03] <+AnIcedCoffee> He's still considered the weakest killer. He requires too much work to take a health state compared to everyone else
[0:19:18] <Dunmarkh> glad the killers are equal oppurtunity
[0:19:21] <+Promessa_EX> and i think all the killers are big aren't they
[0:19:25] <Genoblader> technically there is with the Huntress and Twins
[0:19:30] <+walternatorz> uhhh in game right?
[0:19:32] <+Scevda> I am PRETTY damn sure I asked this long ago but whatev: Your take on Age of Empires, particularly AoEII?
[0:19:33] <$thomassolorio> is she like that new resident evil big titty lady
[0:19:54] <+AnIcedCoffee> Hag for that juicy Ruin value
[0:20:38] <Genoblader> My favorites are The Wraith, Oni, and Nightmare
[0:21:06] <+Dr_DangerPhD> the twins are weird
[0:21:12] <+Smiss_Splattered> Twins can actually be very strong
[0:21:25] <+Smiss_Splattered> but they HAVE to be played in a specific way
[0:21:29] <Genoblader> I have maybe 3 times
[0:21:29] <CandyCoatedConfection> the new killers don't seem to connect with people. blight included.
[0:21:33] <+Smiss_Splattered> otherwise they're really bad
[0:21:38] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Twins are kind of like trapper in a way
[0:21:42] <+AnIcedCoffee> It's because the Twins' design literally encourages a slugging and camping playstyle, it's very boring and people don't really liek it
[0:21:52] <+Scevda> You know DbD will be reaching the bottom of the barrel for new content when they introduce a Cartman from Southpark killer char.
[0:21:54] <Genoblader> Victor
[0:22:07] <cap_bon> has anything interesting happened in warframe lately
[0:22:11] <Genoblader> I wanna see Chucky
[0:22:12] <+pheblorganzardo> bold to assume that a big video game company is capable of learning lessons
[0:22:19] <Genoblader> or maybe a robot
[0:22:30] <+SkookumHime> See ya later Plague! skooku2Luv
[0:22:45] <Regret_rookie> Would terminator make for a good killer?
[0:22:49] <+walternatorz> I'm concerned.
[0:22:50] <CandyCoatedConfection> @pheblorganzardo are they big? I thought they were indie. which to me means smaller than most big game companies.
[0:22:53] <+Scevda> pony tails is immediate killer-bait
[0:23:18] <+Scevda> Quentin is pretty killable
[0:23:38] <+AnIcedCoffee> They hired new 3D artists to work on the new models as of Felix. Old survivors are planned to get a model update at some point
[0:23:41] <+pheblorganzardo> that's true, maybe "bold to assume that any video game company is capable of learning lessons"
[0:23:47] <+Smiss_Splattered> people play legion
[0:24:02] <KellBeII> huntress is bunn <3
[0:24:04] <+pheblorganzardo> a robot would be sweet though
[0:24:08] <+Dr_DangerPhD> i only play huntress just because hitting hatchet skill shots is fun
[0:24:36] <Genoblader> I'm tempted to get Doctor
[0:24:38] <+pheblorganzardo> maybe like a clunky 60's boxy robot
[0:24:58] <+dopey_bullocks> I don't think Freddy was a child molesterer he was framed and then burnt and then haunts kids dreams
[0:25:01] <$thomassolorio> in my head cannon trickster is a crazed nixion
[0:25:08] <+Smiss_Splattered> Wraith is a pretty good start.
[0:25:19] <+Smiss_Splattered> Hes actually pretty good now
[0:25:19] <CandyCoatedConfection> you seem like a vommy mommy type
[0:25:33] <+Scevda> Btw, this seems like the perfect time to breakout the eli-cat vtuber. Did that end up not working at the same time as games?
[0:25:39] <+pheblorganzardo> was wraith the bell guy?
[0:25:49] <+pheblorganzardo> i liked him when i was playing this game
[0:25:54] <+Smiss_Splattered> @pheblorganzardo yes zubMEG
[0:25:57] <+pheblorganzardo> going bingle ding was fun
[0:25:59] <$thomassolorio> o he's coming
[0:26:03] <cap_bon> Does this game have Leather Face or is it off brand legally distinct Leather Face
[0:26:15] <JJenesis> leatherface is in the game
[0:26:18] <+AnIcedCoffee> @cap_bon it has both
[0:26:41] <Genoblader> that's where bbq &chili comes from
[0:27:04] <+Scevda> I see, i see. Mayhaps once the internet thing gets resolved and a new iteration on it. Perhaps outsource it to some ri
[0:27:07] <+Scevda> ya exactly!
[0:27:22] <+Scevda> yayaya, im all for it.
[0:27:35] <+theenigmaticdude> Have they said who the RE rep is?
[0:27:45] <%Amakuni1> This isn't Dangan Ronpa
[0:28:06] <+Scevda> no dungeon grampas today
[0:28:31] <JohnClaggart> the lynx "beard" wouldn't play well with that hat on the model
[0:28:41] <Genoblader> I like Wraith
[0:28:50] <JohnClaggart> though it does fine now on the purple kitty i guess
[0:29:16] <+Scevda> @JohnClaggart My thinking is that the hat will become novelty size like some anime character so that it doesn't get in the way of the beard.
[0:29:32] <CandyCoatedConfection> most likely nemesis right
[0:29:39] <bazzabarra> oh my plague
[0:29:42] <+traximus_s> yeah
[0:29:44] <+Promessa_EX> i wonder if they love nemesis or mr x more
[0:29:46] <mellorolo> plague are you celebrating Alien day?
[0:29:48] <brokendarktower> exciting
[0:30:00] <+pheblorganzardo> big lady would have a psychological advantage
[0:30:00] <bazzabarra> (sees the bottom right) oh .... my .... plague
[0:30:03] <Genoblader> Hope it's Mr. X
[0:30:04] <Laecerelius> Code Veronica?
[0:30:06] <+AnIcedCoffee> Shattered Memories is Silent Hill LUL
[0:30:09] <Dunmarkh> Chris "BoulderPuncher" Redfield chasing you down
[0:30:12] <bazzabarra> bottom left*
[0:30:14] <+pheblorganzardo> since people wouldnt run away as much since they would want to look at her
[0:30:26] <mellorolo> its shattered memories yeah youre right
[0:30:27] <+Scevda> @Dunmarkh if you don't fuck my sister, Im gonna kill you!
[0:30:30] <+dopey_bullocks> how long does it take to get a game as the killer
[0:30:30] <+pheblorganzardo> lol chris redfield would be hilarious
[0:30:31] <Laecerelius> You go to like Antarctica or something like that in Code Veronica
[0:30:32] <Genoblader> it had the flesh creatures
[0:30:34] <+gandergear> inb4 betrayed by the medkit
[0:30:40] <+theenigmaticdude> I would'nt mind if they use Wesker
[0:30:40] <+dopey_bullocks> I just started the game
[0:30:44] <Genoblader> and that was it
[0:30:53] <bazzabarra> i need context for the spyro image
[0:30:56] <bazzabarra> halp
[0:31:07] <deadponic> @dopey_bullocks welcome to DBD, stay far away from legion
[0:31:07] <+pheblorganzardo> idk if wesker fits the tone of DbD
[0:31:08] <+roodlux> HE can see your heart beat when he goes into frenzy and lands a hit
[0:31:09] <+Scevda> I hope its wesker
[0:31:12] <+pheblorganzardo> but would be sik
[0:31:14] <+Scevda> get that voice actor
[0:31:17] <mellorolo> its been long enough we need more wesker
[0:31:20] <AncelDeLambert> he'd get the bamf step-in
[0:31:27] <+gandergear> TOOOOOT
[0:31:30] <+Scevda> doot
[0:31:35] <JoshManVGH> And then suddenly, its the Police Commissioner from RE2.
[0:31:36] <AncelDeLambert> which is why I don't think it's him, there's already too many teleporting enemies
[0:31:38] <+gandergear> Who remembers the beans commercial
[0:31:39] <+dopey_bullocks> I got hillbilly but no games yet and it's been 15 minutes
[0:31:54] <deadponic> @PlagueOfGripes who's your least favourite killer to go up against??????
[0:31:56] <mellorolo> "tooting noise"... you mean flatulence? Kappa
[0:32:11] <+AnIcedCoffee> If it's not Nemesis I'll be surprised. I don't think it's any of the RE8 villains because the collaboration started before RE8 was announced and Director has been dropping references to S.T.A.R.S for a few months
[0:32:12] <+Scevda> gj saving babish
[0:32:18] <bazzabarra> you mean stuffs teen girls commissioner from re2
[0:32:32] <AncelDeLambert> it's either Nemesis or X
[0:32:34] <+gandergear> Leon survivor ftw
[0:32:35] <+dopey_bullocks> in a metal suit girl
[0:32:40] <mellorolo> *nothing commences goes wrong
[0:32:40] <LunarRemix> It could be Leon or Ethan
[0:32:43] <+gandergear> Leon is the bimbo hero
[0:32:43] <AncelDeLambert> maybe Jill
[0:32:47] <Laecerelius> I wanna say Berkin in his first form with the pipe as the monster
[0:32:50] <KaiserMario> I bet Rebecca
[0:32:50] <+gandergear> we don't gotz any of those yet
[0:32:50] <+Scevda> wait, is it claire or jill that is HATED by the RE creator?
[0:32:52] <+pheblorganzardo> leon survivor chris killer
[0:32:52] <s1rcuit> what about that shitty kid from Code Veronica?
[0:32:54] <LunarRemix> Since they're trying to push Ethan lately
[0:32:55] <+SuperKiva> Sherry?
[0:32:57] <LVL1_Scumbag> Not Jill?
[0:33:00] <+AnIcedCoffee> Leon and Claire with legendary skins for Chris and Jill or vice versa
[0:33:01] <$thomassolorio> mvp plauge here
[0:33:05] <+Scevda> or is it rebecca?
[0:33:14] <bazzabarra> does nobody want to address the spyro picture
[0:33:17] <deadponic> my gut says the killer is X and the survivor is either Jill or Claire
[0:33:19] <mellorolo> i want sheva!!
[0:33:24] <+walternatorz> I'd be angry if the survivor is capable
[0:33:33] <+dopey_bullocks> I keep getting connection host could not be established
[0:33:35] <+Scevda> @walternatorz same
[0:33:40] <+Scevda> it doesn't fit the game premise
[0:33:42] <+gandergear> They could do Ethan + Vampire Mommy, we don't have a vampire themed killer yet
[0:33:43] <JoshManVGH> Thump some people with Mr. X fist
[0:33:52] <+Promessa_EX> my bet is still Nemesis and Jill
[0:33:53] <cap_bon> If I cant knock Mr X's hat off to stun him I will be disappointed
[0:33:59] <Laecerelius> You could potentially just make a "Tyrant" that could be the first game's tyrant, Mr. X, or Nemesis without his rocket launcher
[0:34:01] <+Smiss_Splattered> they could do x and make Nemesis a skin like Liss
[0:34:02] <mellorolo> just say fuckit and make the survivor sheva ..
[0:34:17] <+Scevda> survivor ada?
[0:34:17] <mellorolo> thats what i think
[0:34:18] <+pheblorganzardo> the left field pick would be Ramon Salazar
[0:34:31] <mellorolo> ada would be vcool!
[0:34:31] <TheresAGoff> Sheva is far too competent though
[0:34:43] <deadponic> how's this for an idea chat; Mystique as a killer?
[0:34:50] <+AnIcedCoffee> Sheva is just a figment of Chris's imagination though
[0:34:56] <+gandergear> Uhh guys, we're forgetting about Louis, i don't think there's a lotta spanish representation in DBD yet
[0:34:56] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:35:13] <bazzabarra> i endorse sassy salazar
[0:35:35] <+Scevda> louis would be decent
[0:35:45] <+Scevda> is the VA up to anything lately?
[0:36:04] <+theenigmaticdude> Hopefully the re killer won't be Ustanak from 6
[0:36:13] <%CursedNobleman> carlos
[0:36:14] <KellBeII> carlos
[0:36:14] <+traximus_s> carlos?
[0:36:15] <+SuperKiva> Carlos?
[0:36:15] <+AnIcedCoffee> Carlos
[0:36:18] <Laecerelius> The monster should be the guy who can turn into a bone t-rex from RE6
[0:36:21] <+pheblorganzardo> bug grandma from re7 would be an interesting killer
[0:36:23] <+walternatorz> louis was 4 right?
[0:36:28] <+gandergear> wasn't his name louis in RE3?
[0:36:29] <+pheblorganzardo> not really any bug based killers
[0:36:29] <Dunmarkh> Luis was 4

[0:41:56] <bazzabarra> i will whore myself for spyro context
[0:42:00] <+Scevda> First point of advice. crouching and standing still helps a lot more than one would think!
[0:42:03] <+dopey_bullocks> I run in like a bull in a china shop

[0:42:19] <%Zebroneath> @SWindleFeD Thanks for the gift sub!

[0:44:25] <Zeif00> I would consider resilience if you're going for vaults
[0:44:36] <+AnIcedCoffee> that's why windows of opportunity is unironically an underrated perk
[0:44:37] <+dopey_bullocks> you picking up noobs?

[0:45:16] <lewdnekojam> hey plauge i met a Canadian today and it scared me
[0:45:17] <AncelDeLambert> the problem for Paige is that she has Shock Induced Amnesia, and forgets any and every plan the second she gets even slightly spooped
[0:45:28] <%CursedNobleman> eyefart? thats just crying with no tears
[0:45:37] <bazzabarra> no
[0:45:46] <%EyeFarted> Go eat some more hurty sand, @PeachSaliva

[0:46:24] <+GalacticaPhanto> @scevda Getting the vaccine, so she's down there until she gets her 2nd shot
[0:46:25] <lewdnekojam> walmart serves various types of STDs thats for sure
[0:46:26] <+walternatorz> Kmart getting groceries is disgusting
[0:46:27] <CandyCoatedConfection> I can't remember a Walmart or target without food...
[0:46:33] <bazzabarra> walmart only means a thing cos the owner of arsenal football club is married to an heiress
[0:46:33] <+coolbowers> Paige what
[0:46:35] <+Scevda> @GalacticaPhanto makes sense, thanks
[0:46:36] <a_mad_dragon_> 80's/early 90's they were just a shitty k-mart with a mcdonalds in it
[0:46:43] <+kewlmyc> There are now some walmarts that ONLY have groceries
[0:46:45] <radiocrawler> Paige is correct.  Walmart here in this small town they had no groceries. It was just knick knacks.  Same with Target.
[0:46:47] <%gardenhills> you mean fresh produce
[0:46:47] <+ClericOfSparda> she's right
[0:46:47] <bazzabarra> if european that is a big thin
[0:46:50] <mellorolo> he is just picking on you paige
[0:46:52] <mellorolo> LUL
[0:46:53] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> That's correct.
[0:47:00] <JohnClaggart> i dont need to look up big john's statue
[0:47:01] <LunarRemix> Wow it's creepy
[0:47:04] <JoshManVGH> There was a point where the food section of my local Walmart consisted of candy, snacks, and bulk
[0:47:06] <+Ne1son> He has big arms
[0:47:06] <lewdnekojam> wow thats scary
[0:47:06] <CandyCoatedConfection> haven't heard of piggly wiggly in a hot minute

[0:47:20] <lewdnekojam> how do you worship it?
[0:47:26] <+Scevda> I feel like thats a sign of drain bamage
[0:47:30] <SuperVaderMan> Look at this big statue of John
[0:47:30] <+Promessa_EX> that's every day with paige i know it
[0:47:41] <Samex_Comex> In Canada we have Giant Tiger
[0:47:53] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Paige, we all k ow you have many, many brain problems.
[0:47:58] <+walternatorz> big man is both the sculpture and the big man sculpture

[0:48:45] <NONAME0823> You walked past the hex!!!
[0:48:47] <radiocrawler> I remember our high school marching band marched through the Walmart when they opened the big one here.
[0:48:50] <%EyeFarted> Castle Grocery Beast
[0:49:02] <bazzabarra> ie shes not locked in with her brain, her brain is locked in with her
[0:49:04] <+GalacticaPhanto> @johnclaggart Can the Food King fight the Food Lion in NC?
[0:49:12] <mellorolo> most franchises ony last about 10 years on average so ... maybe there was a what was it, "Fast Bag"?
[0:49:16] <+Scevda> dooont-a
[0:49:17] <mellorolo> *only
[0:49:21] <JonnyJug> Nourishment Establishment
[0:49:35] <mellorolo> it just might have closed already :v

[0:50:09] <+Smiss_Splattered> sound is very consistent in this game zubSMILE
[0:50:17] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> We should be very grateful to Paige for protecting the plastic bags from harm.
[0:50:21] <+Scevda> well played
[0:50:21] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:50:22] <Zeif00> LUL

[0:50:35] <%bazzabarra> bazzabarra subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:50:36] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Such a considerate lady.
[0:50:52] <blakyoshi> I think the game just does that if you abuse the same window enough times
[0:50:54] <Genoblader> lmao
[0:50:59] <Genoblader> you fucker
[0:51:11] <%bazzabarra> oh my god twitch exploited my weakness for bulk buying
[0:51:12] <VaDiddles> His perk is Bamboozle. It blocks whatever window he just passed through.
[0:51:16] <CandyCoatedConfection> @blakyoshi I thought so too but I was wondering if I was wrong
[0:51:22] <Genoblader> the thing the Spirit has?
[0:51:27] <+Scevda> damn, i hadn't noticed the hips on Imoya before
[0:51:29] <Genoblader> ah
[0:51:32] <JoshManVGH> lol Why confetti
[0:51:35] <Zeif00> Entity blocks windows after 3 vaults by default
[0:51:35] <%bazzabarra> i bought a year worth of disney plus for just two shows
[0:51:40] <Genoblader> Clown nvm
[0:51:41] <+roodlux> The Entity will block a window if you jump through it too many times in a short amount of time
[0:51:52] <+dopey_bullocks> okay so I'm in now games actually searching how long till I get in

[0:53:53] <%bazzabarra> apart from paige and fuck my ass, thats normal
[0:54:10] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> "Fuck my ass!" - Paige, constantly.
[0:54:22] <KeiganOfAstora> What's the setup here? Is Paige at Plague's place on her laptop or something?
[0:54:24] <%bazzabarra> ye thats the equivalent of 'oh gosh darnit'
[0:54:30] <+Scevda> what mouse you using these days Eli + Paige?
[0:54:33] <+walternatorz> Paige will replace the soup with mommy juice.

[0:56:32] <%bazzabarra> oh my fuck reall
[0:56:41] <%bazzabarra> i gotta go digging
[0:56:57] <+Scevda> So, on that note, would it be worth it to program one of the addtl buttons as space bar for this game?
[0:57:05] <s1rcuit> I thought your face looked 'shopped on
[0:57:06] <+Scevda> for you both.
[0:57:20] <%bazzabarra> its funny how I chose global pandemic to fall outta internet culture

[0:58:28] <+AnIcedCoffee> It's just latency
[0:58:32] <radiocrawler> Yeah the hitbox on going through the window is infuriating
[0:58:39] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> Backstreet vs. Nsync is a played out argument.
[0:58:40] <Genoblader> that's where I always put the trap
[0:58:41] <%bazzabarra> OOOH ugggh AHHH oooooooooooo
[0:58:43] <radiocrawler> It looks so ridiculous so often.
[0:58:53] <%bazzabarra> these screams are too much
[0:59:00] <+Jonny_Worldbeater> The real question is: TLC or Destiny's Child?
[0:59:04] <Genoblader> cause I know that people  love to play the shack
