[0:01:41] <+gupa5240> Billion years Plagueofgripes
[0:02:09] <tanarath> twitch seems fine, but it buffers every once in a while.
[0:02:30] <+ClericOfSparda> Hey Plague
[0:02:35] <IrionX> Try changing your encoder?
[0:02:35] <+D4C_Trice> did the computer update?
[0:02:44] <gazdropish> hey man hows the internet
[0:02:47] <+scerpico> Hello Plague, hoes the bitter nostalgia treating you?
[0:04:33] <MagusTheSleepy> Seems comfy. You love to see things being comfy.
[0:04:58] <%TheZanic> TheZanic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months! 
[0:05:14] <+D4C_Trice> Question about the spells, did they always require a blue materia to multi cast them on foes?
[0:05:39] <+Mekhet09> yes
[0:06:13] <+Mekhet09> Some spells were AOE but only at the more expensive versions.
[0:06:29] <+D4C_Trice> Ice the sparkling flavoured water?
[0:06:47] <+Pleblu> Thats good stuff
[0:06:50] <Schuhart> Eli's continued adventures in flavor-town.
[0:08:03] <+ClericOfSparda> That's pretty nuts
[0:08:15] <Frazbeee> power of friendship
[0:08:21] <%atlasdotwav> I'm playin nut, ouwsiide
[0:08:53] <+Mekhet09> I know I'm repeating myself. But I hate how ff7r made there be a day time to the sectors. It ruined the oppressiveness of it. Aeris' house was an exception of an oasis in a desert.
[0:09:51] <ralphwiggum16> Heya Plaguers!
[0:09:54] <+D4C_Trice> I want to live in Aerith's remake house
[0:09:58] <Puhff> psaDab
[0:10:34] <+CalderGaming> maybe he are sick
[0:10:34] <+Pleblu> Guys an asshat
[0:10:35] <MeronLod> He's always having private times in there.
[0:10:57] <MagusTheSleepy> "Yeah, sure, gimme your Gil, I swear I'll do it."
[0:11:02] <+CalderGaming> welp
[0:11:08] <+D4C_Trice> do the failed Sephiroth clones that have tattoos on them exist in OG FF7?
[0:11:09] <%cosmicleviathan18> Imagine if we could have this game in the remake animation, oh wait plagueFear
[0:11:55] <%Heart0fInk> Yes this time ghost man JUST got here
[0:12:17] <+Mekhet09> You need a tv to hear the propaganda.
[0:12:19] <%Heart0fInk> Maybe this was someone elses 'house'
[0:12:22] <%MightyDuckShoes> Now that FF7R is on PC, maybe we will get that modded remake.
[0:12:22] <Puhff> the tv also has tubes that dont seem to be connected to anything
[0:12:26] <%atlasdotwav> He got them for being siiiick
[0:12:28] <+Pleblu> thats his dish
[0:12:29] <%cosmicleviathan18> blue soda can?
[0:12:32] <MagusTheSleepy> How did he install those shelves?
[0:12:39] <Puhff> yeah thats his food bowl eli jeez
[0:12:40] <%daveronald> thats his water dish
[0:12:56] <+D4C_Trice> Maybe he drinks out of the dog dish?
[0:13:01] <+FingaLights> Flowers are more important
[0:13:14] <%MightyDuckShoes> Aeris doesn't like how the poors smell.
[0:13:30] <%MightyDuckShoes> Excuse me. Aerifffffffffff
[0:13:32] <Puhff> Eli can YOU help him???
[0:13:40] <+D4C_Trice> she's only half a Cetra
[0:13:45] <Puhff> this feels like a dora the explorer episode
[0:13:47] <MagusTheSleepy> "I'm a Mercenary, not a Doctor!"
[0:13:56] <%MightyDuckShoes> Put him out of his misery?
[0:14:00] <Puhff> "Can YOU help the man with brain damage?"
[0:14:02] <%Heart0fInk> Sneeze into his mouth and heal him
[0:14:10] <Puhff> "Let's help him together!"
[0:14:16] <itsdasteve> Are you a bad enough dude to fix brain damage?
[0:14:43] <%kyh9> Been enjoying hearingn your thoughts on FF7 and its story and such
[0:15:38] <+Mekhet09> Is this just her realizing cloud and sephs clone are similar? It might just have been foreshadowing.
[0:16:10] <Puhff> can he know?
[0:16:47] <kjb343> somehow those objects on the table in front of that guy are guns
[0:16:52] <+D4C_Trice> audio isn't stuttering on my end so I think things are stable for the mean time
[0:16:52] <Puhff> even the bad ones???
[0:17:10] <+Mekhet09> That place looks like shit.
[0:17:17] <Puhff> he's selling NFTs
[0:17:20] <%jaypeesan> Cheers to Kentucky yeeehaaaaa
[0:17:29] <%cosmicleviathan18> he sells cigs
[0:17:56] <itsdasteve> "Oh, hi Bark"
[0:18:04] <%cosmicleviathan18> bo8Jamming bo8Jamming bo8Jamming
[0:18:16] <Coystick> Hunters Dream tbh
[0:18:34] <+Mekhet09> Making cloud a bitch. \
[0:18:53] <%atlasdotwav> Cover + counter + double hit + poison
[0:19:14] <%Jetsfantasy> Invulnerability is level 3 I think
[0:19:28] <Puhff> i've never been able to get her level 4 LB before "the incident"
[0:19:37] <+Mekhet09> Level 4 is op as hell because of her limited  party use.
[0:19:46] <%cosmicleviathan18> Aeris Limit breaks are so good, sucks she's gone so quick ryboogFace
[0:19:55] <%arkv01> I've never used any of her limit breaks besides healing wind in the 20+ years of playing ff7 LUL
[0:20:10] <+D4C_Trice> she's one of the best white mages ever I hear
[0:20:30] <+Stormzcales_Lair> added with a hyper too
[0:21:04] <+Gigagoat> Zombie Aeris
[0:21:08] <%cosmicleviathan18> Cid?
[0:21:12] <theloganbrand> A friendly phantom put her back in the game.
[0:21:26] <%Runtripfall> Gary Oak?
[0:21:28] <+D4C_Trice> Patches
[0:21:50] <%kyh9> Mm, yeah
[0:22:15] <%kyh9> War-settings usually have those sorts of stone-cold operators
[0:22:25] <%kyh9> Fury had a good one
[0:22:31] <%kyh9> Brad Pitt in Fury was one of those
[0:22:48] <Schuhart> Rachel in Animorphs
[0:23:39] <+crazyspartan214> "special" flower
[0:23:59] <+Mekhet09> Damn.
[0:24:08] <LVL1_Scumbag> Gotta keep her humble
[0:24:11] <+Mekhet09> Just shutting her down.
[0:24:23] <+D4C_Trice> I think Aerith appeared when she could have kids but knew Aerith needed someone
[0:24:32] <%lemoan> they can't get enough of his razor sharp hair
[0:24:32] <+Dooms_Dave> who wouldnt be attracted to those huge forearms
[0:24:33] <%Heart0fInk> Handsome. but dudes say he looks like "A Tough Guy"
[0:24:41] <Puhff> a girl DansGame
[0:24:44] <%Jetsfantasy> I know the eyes of his are always a big deal because everyone always talks about his glowing jenova cancer eyes
[0:24:46] <+Stormzcales_Lair> yea soldiers are cannon bishie
[0:24:49] <%atlasdotwav> In my head He's pretty in as in like a Griffith way

[0:29:07] <Puhff> thinking DansGame
[0:29:11] <scempriss> imagine how much it weighs
[0:29:17] <%arkv01> yeah I thought that was an extra size microwave/oven
[0:29:17] <Eger007> tube tvs so comfy
[0:29:20] <Dunmarkh> like solid snake
[0:29:48] <+crowmium> and monsters and ghosts
[0:29:55] <Puhff> I feel like if I got to choose, I'd go with hypothermia. They say it's like falling asleep
[0:30:05] <+TwitchGuy2021> Ever play this game with the translation mod?
[0:30:21] <%arkv01> *sniffffff* ohhh yeah elmyra you smell good guuurl
[0:30:34] <+crowmium> yeah the flashback

[0:30:59] <+Mekhet09> What is this Tarantino  plays \ff7 .
[0:31:03] <%arkv01> we didn't get this flashback in the remake right
[0:31:06] <+FingaLights> Wise mom
[0:31:10] <%cosmicleviathan18> MILF?
[0:31:11] <Eger007> that's weird, mom
[0:31:14] <+crowmium> is this even Clouds memory at this point?
[0:31:17] <%Jetsfantasy> She's like a year older
[0:31:22] <sephyrbr> 1 year older
[0:31:31] <%kyh9> Cloud's Mom: Wow, you're fucking useless, you need to get a mom-gf to take care of you
[0:31:39] <+TwitchGuy2021> Yeah, mom ships them
[0:31:47] <ThePimpGuin> but Cloud has the mind of a 15yro
[0:31:59] <%cosmicleviathan18> @kyh9 LUL LUL LUL
[0:32:00] <%arkv01> cloud is eternally in his naruto phase
[0:32:16] <+crowmium> she's waiting for cloud to come in
[0:32:21] <sephyrbr> Cloud  is saving his first kiss for Sephiroth Then and now
[0:32:24] <%arkv01> come inside cloud
[0:32:45] <tokio_red> Final Fantasy vii, eh? Neato.
[0:32:54] <%lemoan> "You have to fuck my daughter, Leo-I mean Cloud...."
[0:33:17] <+Mekhet09> I think it was during nibihiem.
[0:33:19] <%kyh9> I assume it's something that happened during the visit with Zack and Sephie
[0:33:32] <+TwitchGuy2021> Yep
[0:33:40] <%kyh9> Well, as a grunt
[0:33:42] <Stillchr> sadness, i missed half an hour
[0:33:58] <+themathpope> themathpope subscribed with Prime. 
[0:34:56] <Stillchr> the biggest
[0:34:58] <+FingaLights> Nods
[0:34:58] <scempriss> damn right
[0:35:15] <ThePimpGuin> japan dont like asses
[0:35:18] <thetruthofyourbeing> the dumpy
[0:35:21] <%Jetsfantasy> dandyfNodding Makes sense dandyfNodding
[0:35:22] <ThePimpGuin> too "fat"
[0:35:23] <%Futurecity10> I never played ff7 so I have no attraction to Tifa or Aeris
[0:35:25] <+天使42199> @thepimpguin but 2b
[0:35:26] <+captain_thickthighs> Japan fears phat assess
[0:35:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> I wish japanese games could model better asses
[0:35:35] <%themathpope> I do more philosophy these days, actually
[0:35:44] <ThePimpGuin> @天使42199 yoko taro is special
[0:35:50] <sephyrbr> Yaay best enemy
[0:35:54] <%lemoan> @plagueofgripes You know the Japanese hate large posteriors. They love the tiddy though
[0:35:55] <Stillchr> the giant house
[0:35:58] <+crazyspartan214> so it the choice of whether I choice the ass or the boob.
[0:36:05] <+Mekhet09> Sadly out of boss.
[0:36:08] <+captain_thickthighs> @lvl1_scumbag they don't have much live reference
[0:36:13] <Hoot_Patoots> i did really like the inclusion of hell house in remake
[0:36:14] <+Mekhet09> Should have been a normal enemy.
[0:36:21] <theredfox930000> what you gonna do with all that junk all that junk inside that trunk
[0:36:23] <Hoot_Patoots> i like that they kept weird stuff
[0:36:25] <Flamethrowerman09> I'm trying to make a new pc, but amazon still hasn't shipped my cpu (Ryzen 5 3600)
[0:36:31] <tokio_red> Was Aeris supposed to be perceived as a flirtatious gal whose been around town or no? As I played the game as an adult I lean more towards the former.
[0:36:32] <%Heart0fInk> wait Wait WAIT!! You mean to tell me Aeris isn't a hand clasping starry eyed quite shrine madden? LE GASP!!
[0:36:35] <%lemoan> @futurecity10 you don't have to play a game to like the character.
[0:36:43] <%kyh9> I always assumed the point of Hell House was that the slums are so fucked that there are entire monsters living in abandoned houses
[0:36:53] <%Futurecity10> yeah I know, but I just dont care for either
[0:37:08] <%gupa5240> mother bearing hips
[0:37:11] <Flamethrowerman09> I wonder if they're going to make those biker monsters outside Midgar into bosses in part 2.
[0:37:13] <+illoonar> aurGasm
[0:37:20] <sephyrbr> I'm just glad they didn't  over-explain Cloud's giant swords.
[0:37:32] <%arkv01> they really nerfed her hip and ass in the remake huh'
[0:37:34] <%Heart0fInk> @gupa5240 For her to bear mothers huh?
[0:37:37] <%kyh9> Yeah, Aerith has a true hourglass figure
[0:37:41] <%Heart0fInk> Child Bearing hips
[0:37:53] <%gupa5240> i know what I typed
[0:38:03] <+crowmium> half of the shit in ff7 doesn't make sense and is literally explained by "this is a video game"
[0:38:04] <%kyh9> You ever play Lost Odyssey?
[0:38:04] <%Heart0fInk> plagueBark
[0:38:10] <%atlasdotwav> Music sounds better for some reason?
[0:38:43] <%lemoan> holy shit she do got a dumpy
[0:38:47] <%Heart0fInk> She like a dollar store lazer gun
[0:38:49] <+Mekhet09> my first playthrough they were at like level 20 before I got out and had cloud's 3rd limit break because the geometry was too bullshit for kid me.
[0:38:56] <Stillchr> Kingdom heart feet
[0:38:58] <%arkv01> she do hit all the right buttons
[0:38:59] <Flamethrowerman09> Like Street Fighter characters
[0:39:03] <+crowmium> she's just wearing ugg boots
[0:39:08] <%gupa5240> @Heart0fInk plagueHarkness
[0:39:09] <%arkv01> I love me a dumptruck with big wheels
[0:39:12] <TheGuesty> oh I'm lookin'...
[0:39:19] <+crazyspartan214> boob > ass
[0:39:30] <ThePimpGuin> its all crisis cores fault
[0:39:32] <Puhff> sadge
[0:39:35] <scempriss> even Clouds got more cake than her in the remake
[0:39:38] <+FingaLights> MOds need to fix this atrocity
[0:39:51] <%MightyDuckShoes> Well they kind of toned them both down. Aeris still had cake, I think.
[0:39:59] <+KiwiRedgrave> a pretty kitty
[0:40:02] <Stillchr> catgirl plague?
[0:40:05] <%Heart0fInk> A cute kitty with a HUUUUGE Penis.
[0:40:09] <%arkv01> but plague your current kitty is so tired and cute...
[0:40:15] <%cosmicleviathan18> I never understood why we fight a house ryboogFace
[0:40:16] <%MightyDuckShoes> "I think" kind of betrays my statement, though.
[0:40:17] <%lemoan> @plagueofgripes Japan really seems to be opposed to any form of body fat EXCEPT breasts. so no bug butts.
[0:40:24] <+askalta> catgirl plague
[0:40:53] <scempriss> @MightyDuckShoes yeah, more like pancake
[0:40:56] <+crowmium> can't that suicide skill do instant death? I feel like I had a battle where I got wiped by that
[0:41:08] <+FingaLights> You fight a boat latter
[0:41:10] <+FingaLights> later
[0:41:13] <%arkv01> sometimes the market goes to hell and real estate gets a little demonic
[0:41:15] <Hoot_Patoots> there's like skeleton bikes, they're great
[0:41:16] <+Taglog7> aren't we all fighting houses
[0:41:20] <%kyh9> MOTORCYCLE
[0:41:24] <Hoot_Patoots> yesssss
[0:41:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> true LUL
[0:41:32] <%kyh9> FF7 Remake is too grounded for its own good
[0:41:32] <+FingaLights> They ride themselves
[0:41:36] <Flamethrowerman09> They're gonna turn that thing into a boss.
[0:41:39] <wolfen091> alexa really went off the rails huh
[0:41:39] <%arkv01> sentient motorcycles that will do my groceries for me
[0:41:45] <%lemoan> @arkv01 It was an allegory for housing crisis all along
[0:41:47] <%kyh9> FF7 was STILL in the same series as FF1-6 where they just have monsters roaming out and about
[0:41:55] <+crowmium> you fight all sorts of inanimate objects
[0:41:57] <Hoot_Patoots> the ultimate life form
[0:42:04] <Hoot_Patoots> a motorcycle that can rev itself
[0:42:09] <TheGuesty> Shadow Hearts enemies had the most Lovecraftian enemies
[0:42:12] <%atlasdotwav> Infinite energy
[0:42:16] <%MightyDuckShoes> @Scrempriss Come on. It's not -looks on google for 2 seconds- Oh.. She's just a candy apple on a stick. Her head's so big...
[0:42:27] <+FingaLights> They eat holes
[0:42:28] <LVL1_Scumbag> Carrion predators
[0:42:28] <ThePimpGuin> radroaches
[0:42:42] <ThePimpGuin> makworms
[0:43:04] <%kyh9> I always just assumed it was monsters inhabiting abandoned slum houses like hermit crabs
[0:43:04] <TheGuesty> No, better to use the "SHUT UP, Don't think about it!"
[0:43:06] <+D4C_Trice> So they're like Yokai?
[0:43:09] <+crowmium> knowing what I know now about how Japanese game studios are organized, these enemies were probably just pawned off on some intern level graphic designer
[0:43:11] <%MightyDuckShoes> How does Cloud have a fatter ass now?
[0:43:13] <%arkv01> shinra making more monsters sounds about right
[0:43:32] <%MightyDuckShoes> SQUATS
[0:43:36] <Hoot_Patoots> I do think tho that it's easier to get away with weird/crazy concepts and worlds on something that's lower fidelity. Both in terms of world but also just execution
[0:43:39] <%gupa5240> like a hermit crab
[0:43:50] <sephyrbr> Always felt their  pollutions and screwups create monsters, and then Shinra also tries to make some in a controleld fashion. Because Hojo.
[0:43:53] <SuperVaderMan> it's like some weird kinda robot
[0:44:10] <+D4C_Trice> I hated the remake hellhouse fight
[0:44:28] <+crowmium> if the world was this full of monsters no humans would even live here, so...
[0:44:32] <+captain_thickthighs> fyi there's a Moda that lets you save anywhere it's so helpful
[0:44:36] <scempriss> Cloud recieved all the thirst energy in the remake.
[0:45:04] <%arkv01> I was disappointed cloud only got one dress in remake
[0:45:06] <%gupa5240> what would call prehistoric animals?
[0:45:07] <Hoot_Patoots> yeah, and really most game dev is assembled by a lot of strings and tape and lots of wishes (speaking as a dev)
[0:45:50] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah because it was a damage sponge
[0:46:08] <Hoot_Patoots> it was a bit overlong, but the commentators were lots of fun
[0:46:25] <+captain_thickthighs> Remake seem more like a game for those who played ff7 than a freash game. like a tv special
[0:46:26] <tolloponik> it also had moments of you can't hurt me :)
[0:46:55] <+crowmium> the stream seems fine to me
[0:47:00] <JackPot_ALX> Thanks to 7R I don’t think I can ever play 15 again. Quite enjoy the feel of 7R
[0:47:06] <Hoot_Patoots> @tolloponik yeaaah, that was frustrating. Like if you don't have the good materias equipped in advance, the fight could be a real slog
[0:47:11] <+KenAshcorp> The retexture makes this area so much more bareable. As a kid, I always missed where to go on that screen
[0:47:11] <%octotasty> hey Plagueman, hey chat. I see we're fighting hell houses
[0:47:16] <leinadtonu> I wonder where all those frames go...
[0:47:28] <%Heart0fInk> How Do You Miss A House!?
[0:47:44] <%lemoan> it's not too bad since it's an rpg and there not much to miss visuslly
[0:47:46] <ArashlTempesta> dont be rude let him transform!
[0:47:48] <Hoot_Patoots> i'm fine with that as long as you have OTHER things to hit
[0:47:53] <Hoot_Patoots> to make the phase go faster
[0:47:56] <%kyh9> It's kind of stupid.  I'd rather it be a mechanic I can undermine
[0:48:13] <+KenAshcorp> It was that beam across the gap, it was so hard to read as a kid that it was where you were supposed to go
[0:48:34] <%Heart0fInk> This hand area fucking sucked in remake. i was a god damn slog
[0:49:12] <%Heart0fInk> it*
[0:49:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:50:31] <Kunafish> how tall is plague cat?
[0:50:32] <%arkv01> some kid drops it between now and then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[0:50:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> maybe it fell.
[0:50:58] <Dunmarkh> garfield slide
[0:51:03] <+D4C_Trice> She probably hasn't been here since Zach
[0:51:09] <Stillchr> zach?
[0:51:24] <+crowmium> also how has Shinra not captured her if she never leaves home
[0:51:26] <cap_bon> Does this version have Biggs sweeping dirt ?
[0:51:38] <penitentpendant> Was this in Crisis Core?
[0:51:42] <%Heart0fInk> like a body...
[0:52:01] <+D4C_Trice> Yeah Zach was crisis core
[0:52:08] <TheGuesty> crush
[0:52:10] <%Heart0fInk> A bit monkey cheese
[0:52:19] <TheGuesty> The first she wanted to crush her pelvis
[0:52:35] <JackPot_ALX> So a proper translation would be like “first crush”
[0:52:42] <%Heart0fInk> @TheGuesty with the size of her ass? she was doing the crushing
[0:52:51] <TheGuesty> ;)
[0:52:59] <Hoot_Patoots> that's some eeaaaarly polygon era chocobo
[0:53:00] <tolloponik> it's in pain
[0:53:00] <+askalta> it's not like I'm impersonating him
[0:53:01] <+crowmium> LUL
[0:53:06] <Hoot_Patoots> lmao
[0:53:09] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[0:53:12] <cap_bon> hes doing his best leave him alone
[0:53:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> he's seen some stuff
[0:53:25] <+D4C_Trice> I thought that Zach was into her and was going to take her on a date until he disappeared
[0:53:27] <TheGuesty> Chun Li dress Toifa = best dress
[0:53:33] <%Jetsfantasy> Yup
[0:53:43] <cap_bon> Is it cross dressing time tomatoJoy ?
[0:53:46] <+crowmium> consider that we were all looking at this on fuzzy 17" CRTs
[0:53:53] <+D4C_Trice> I like the kimono look for tifa
[0:54:00] <itsdasteve> Should be dressed like Paige during her cooking streams
[0:54:04] <LVL1_Scumbag> It's where the munchkins live
[0:54:04] <TheMoenia> looks like a porty potty
[0:54:05] <Dunmarkh> outhouse
[0:54:07] <Hoot_Patoots> i just love this cat slide
[0:54:16] <JackPot_ALX> Glad they nixed the weird Tifa Aerith rivalry from Remake. That always felt odd in the original to me
[0:54:20] <%Heart0fInk> AND I LOVE THAT!!!
[0:54:28] <Hoot_Patoots> fucking midgarfield
[0:54:28] <%Heart0fInk> They did none of that in remake
[0:54:46] <108Sins> ratJAM
[0:54:47] <%Heart0fInk> there's no character to any of the environments in remake
[0:54:53] <Dunmarkh> side faucet on the water fountain. Have almost that exact fountain in a nearby park
[0:54:55] <%Heart0fInk> they all look pretty
[0:55:05] <%Heart0fInk> even tho it's a fuckin slum!
[0:55:34] <+crowmium> is the ground irradiated or polluted there? that's all I could ever think about there
[0:55:44] <cap_bon> Seeing all these pre rendered backgrounds makes me wanna play Digimon World
[0:55:46] <LVL1_Scumbag> Offering a bang room
[0:55:49] <TheMoenia> like a love hotel i guess
[0:55:56] <%arkv01> this is definitely fuck town
[0:56:15] <%octotasty> Tim would never say Fuck. He'd say Frick or something like that
[0:56:25] <Glasphemy> seeing a dingy motel in a city full of trash fills me with determination
[0:56:39] <+WatchYouSay> @cap_bon great game
[0:56:43] <Flamethrowerman09> Of all the new characters in Re;make, the doorguy (of all people) I found to be my favorite.
[0:57:15] <Dunmarkh> A dabbling pimp
[0:57:16] <TheGuesty> more like a diddler
[0:57:39] <+captain_thickthighs> a dabbler
[0:57:40] <Hoot_Patoots> doobleydoo
[0:57:47] <Glasphemy> a gallery to view your pieces? like your deviant art and youtube?
[0:58:01] <cap_bon> sure you have a gallery its under the media tab on twitter tomatoSmile
[0:58:07] <fartgasblast> final fantasy 7 remake better then this
[0:58:27] <+crowmium> in context I think they mean he's a hobbyist at sex slavery
[0:59:08] <+D4C_Trice> Johnny is a loser in remake
[0:59:08] <+Mekhet09> It's just prostitution.
[0:59:18] <Glasphemy> Why yes, he's also know for dabbling in the organ trade and child murder
[0:59:45] <cap_bon> I hate that twitter is the only way to get your art out there anymore tomatoPain
[0:59:48] <Flamethrowerman09> Walmart.et
[1:00:01] <Dunmarkh> @D4C_Trice He's a loser in the original too
[1:00:02] <%lemoan> That't hot
[1:00:19] <%Omotat> Wonder who that  could be
[1:00:31] <TheMoenia> how old is she supposed to be? like 17?
[1:00:36] <cap_bon> why cant I investigate this sex brothel for ugly bastards
[1:00:55] <%lemoan> @themoenia apparently 22
[1:01:42] <cap_bon> Cloud you gotta dress up as a lady to save the world trust me
[1:01:47] <TheMoenia> @lemoan huh, thanks
[1:02:16] <sephyrbr> GUILT Tripped. Aeris confirmed catholic
[1:02:26] <+D4C_Trice> There's still British sit coms that are men in women's clothing
[1:02:42] <Daxalog> This really makes it seem like Aeris just came up with some dumb idea and they just went with it.
[1:02:44] <%kyh9> I think part of it is that they turned Honey Bee from a whore-house into a Burlesque club
[1:02:56] <tolloponik> it looked like it awakened something in aeris
[1:02:57] <%kyh9> So the cross-dressing itself receives more dignity by association
[1:03:30] <+crowmium> I liked this segment the first couple times I played it and now I just find it tedious to do all this shit to just advance the plot a tiny amount
[1:03:35] <Flamethrowerman09> Guiseppe
[1:04:15] <+D4C_Trice> Take the folks from Little Britain for instance, dressing up as women as well as blacking up or being racist Asian stereotypes
[1:04:19] <TheGuesty> pretty sure it's long green dress and pony tail
[1:04:38] <+crowmium> it's a traditional Japanese tradesperson's clothes
[1:04:48] <+crowmium> she's a clothier
[1:05:11] <108Sins> korean bbq Kreygasm
[1:05:12] <+crowmium> or seamstress
[1:05:16] <%kyh9> Hibachi?
[1:05:18] <TheGuesty> Can't call it Wutai beef
[1:05:26] <Mister_McDerp> korean bbq is so good
[1:05:28] <+askalta> and texas apparently in tifas bar
[1:05:29] <%kyh9> yakiniku?
[1:05:35] <%arkv01> damn this kitchen looks great now
[1:05:55] <+D4C_Trice> hurray for food poisoning
[1:06:03] <+askalta> rocky mountain oysters
[1:06:05] <+Kriptin> Dine N Dash is the aim of the game
[1:06:11] <%arkv01> cloud why did you even eat dog food at some point the past
[1:06:20] <TheGuesty> Gotta get a guy a shit ticket
[1:06:37] <TheMoenia> honestly, i could be convinced to try rocky mountain oysters
[1:07:02] <+InternetShis> I wish Square was good at making games so I could use a controller for FF7 with all the mods I shoved into its spaghetti bottleneck engine
[1:07:07] <+D4C_Trice> To be honest I can see Cloud buying a tin of food not knowing it was dog food
[1:07:07] <+Mekhet09> You're going to make cloud the prettiest?
[1:07:12] <Flamethrowerman09> You can use deodorant, but it won't be the optimal choice.
[1:07:27] <+Kriptin> Is digestive a mistranslation of Laxative or something?
[1:07:35] <Flamethrowerman09> Is Hyper like the equivalent of an Upper drug?
[1:07:50] <%octotasty> cures [Sadness]? Give me 10
[1:07:59] <+Mekhet09> Yeah it's an upper.
[1:08:14] <+Mekhet09> Guess
[1:08:31] <+dante_must_die_exe> ODEN stand
[1:08:37] <vaydoze> every shop owner in the slums just has a turret ready to kill customers
[1:08:43] <Flamethrowerman09> The DRUGS man
[1:08:51] <+InternetShis> When did things start becoming intuitive in FF games?
[1:08:53] <+crowmium> selling strategy guides was part of the business model back then
[1:09:05] <Daxalog> oh this song
[1:09:25] <%arkv01> its like a tumor ScaredyCat
[1:09:27] <+crazyspartan214> I see it now Kappa
[1:09:30] <TheGuesty> "I have balls to show off, ladies can't see"
[1:09:32] <+InternetShis> Slumdog dumpy
[1:09:33] <LVL1_Scumbag> Could balance a tray on that thing
[1:09:34] <Flamethrowerman09> it's like Zelda in Smash Ultimate
[1:09:38] <+dante_must_die_exe> weak mako ass
[1:09:45] <%kyh9> Her ass is pretty generous, even by comparison to Yuffie and Tifa
[1:09:47] <wolfen091> the Chad rhombus ass
[1:09:49] <+InternetShis> Aerass
[1:09:51] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Chad Aeris ass
[1:09:51] <Daxalog> Shes just leaning forward
[1:09:54] <locobo98> the thiccness
[1:10:03] <%Heart0fInk> You could fit a whole tea set on dat ass
[1:10:05] <%arkv01> that ass was built to smother the life out of men's faces
[1:10:10] <vaydoze> she could have caught the meteor all by herself no need for holy
[1:10:23] <%lemoan> @daxalog SHE LEANING BACK
[1:10:32] <Flamethrowerman09> What does it sell, condoms?
[1:10:41] <locobo98> its porn
[1:11:38] <locobo98> grugs
[1:11:41] <TheGuesty> more Wutai periphenalia
[1:11:43] <Neoripo> This is a "Traditional medicine" place
[1:11:48] <%octotasty> it's magical chinese medice that doesn't really work
[1:11:57] <%octotasty> medicine*
[1:12:41] <locobo98> its ground spider penises
[1:13:04] <Flamethrowerman09> It's a store that only sells the item "drugs" in FF7 Abridged.
[1:13:05] <Mizaiya> What if we pushed our beds together chat?
[1:13:05] <Neoripo> Pulverized endangered species to make your pp stronger
[1:13:17] <Flamethrowerman09> FF7 Abridged sucked.
[1:13:57] <tolloponik> So your saying the dust of elephant tusks, can't be used as a primitive form of Viagra D:
[1:13:59] <%lemoan> @flamethrowerman09 nah man ff7 Barret was great
[1:15:34] <TheGuesty> just cheat engine the gil
[1:15:42] <%Heart0fInk> All i can say is that this song in this game is smooth and classy sounding. This song in remake actually makes me want to puke.
[1:15:43] <Neoripo> Pre-rendered backgrounds had so much details. Nowadays they don't even bother creating that. Uless you are Ubisoft and fill kilometers with copypasted assets because size is a bulletpoint
[1:15:57] <ArashlTempesta> al 3
[1:16:13] <+crowmium> I think he's drunk
[1:16:18] <%gupa5240> gupa5240 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 2 in the channel! 
[1:16:19] <%gupa5240> gupa5240 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Double_negative! 
[1:16:48] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Aeris you monster
[1:17:05] <%lemoan> "What? a tough looking twink like that!?"
[1:17:18] <+Mekhet09> It's fine.
[1:17:49] <Neoripo> Okama
[1:17:59] <TheGuesty> New Half
[1:18:02] <TheGuesty> haha
[1:18:03] <+Mekhet09> Yes. Okama
[1:18:07] <Flamethrowerman09> @Neoripo God forbid Ubisoft got its hands on JavaScript
[1:18:24] <+D4C_Trice> okama yeah
[1:18:25] <Flamethrowerman09> Like Mr2 from One Piece.
[1:19:05] <+pectusumbra> just have to destroy the planet for hangover medicine technology
[1:19:10] <tolloponik> she Didn't Flush Kappa
[1:19:39] <+DrTribal> aw shoot how long has plague been streaming?
[1:20:04] <+Mekhet09> Are you having the dude  gangbang?
[1:20:39] <Neoripo> I noticed Ubisoft cares more about size that content with AC Rogue. If you only do the main path and sidequests, you only explore like 30% of the map. The rest of the map is just treasure and collectables
[1:20:46] <Flamethrowerman09> She's a little gremlin
[1:21:13] <+D4C_Trice> the idea of her trolling cloud is great
[1:21:28] <Flamethrowerman09> Squatacles.
[1:21:46] <theloganbrand> Reminds me of Baki
[1:22:11] <Daxalog> Reminds me of Yojimbo. Kinda.
[1:22:14] <Neoripo> Probably lost in translation
[1:22:37] <Neoripo> Original must be "Aniki"
[1:23:11] <%cosmicleviathan18> YES SQUATS!!!
[1:23:20] <+D4C_Trice> I hated the pull up minigame
[1:23:27] <penitentpendant> I think the minigames are considered the most difficult part of FF7R
[1:23:48] <+D4C_Trice> I've got dyspraxia so my clumsy hands made the game worse
[1:25:01] <Neoripo> Okama. They must not have bothered making another model
[1:25:37] <TheGuesty> The "Barnaby" mustache, like the guys from Family Guy
[1:26:02] <+DrTribal> They are all big bro
[1:26:06] <Profmcstevie> There are many big bros in my life plagueNYA
[1:26:10] <penitentpendant> I assume it's a translation of "Aniki" from japanese
[1:26:18] <+crowmium> the translation is fucking terrible
[1:26:28] <TheGuesty> or "Oni chan" haha
[1:26:28] <+crowmium> it's best not to worry about it
[1:27:00] <penitentpendant> So upperclassman subtext
[1:27:13] <TheFramedWarlock> What's gripin folks
[1:27:33] <Neoripo> I think it's just messy translation. If you use auto-translate you will quickly notice It messes with subjects A LOT
[1:27:51] <shiny_prinny> i got stuck on the shinra bldg elevator on my recent playthrough, had to reset
[1:28:08] <+pectusumbra> It's a matter of discretion and all I'd imagine
[1:28:15] <Flamethrowerman09> Maybe it's like a credit card.
[1:28:25] <+pectusumbra> you wouldn't really want your face on a VIP card for a strip club/sex house
[1:28:47] <+crowmium> LUL
[1:28:49] <TheGuesty> rape house
[1:28:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:28:57] <+Mekhet09> I listen to this so I don't really mind your dropped frames.
[1:29:07] <Neoripo> Motomu Toriyama's favorite place
[1:29:12] <+walternatorz> the death cult scene isn't a concern?
[1:29:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> Because think of the children
[1:30:01] <+D4C_Trice> Honeybee inn is the playboy mansion really
[1:30:18] <Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes All the overt content got cut. There are some remnant scenes floating on the internet
[1:30:47] <Eger007> japanese
[1:30:56] <+walternatorz> an old couple making fun of their partner's age?
[1:31:03] <kjb343> people mad about their h-games not being sold on psn thought sony would force sqenix to remove stuff
[1:31:08] <N8r_Tot> oh, neat!
[1:31:22] <penitentpendant> I assume it's a direct translation of 'Oji-san' and 'oba-san'
[1:31:29] <+walternatorz> maybe Cait Sith was meant to get to the room over?
[1:31:32] <+crowmium> cat-shee
[1:31:36] <+crowmium> I believe
[1:31:46] <+crowmium> it's scottish?
[1:31:48] <+Mekhet09> Those are supposed to be reeves parents I never got that.
[1:32:06] <%Heart0fInk> This Is A High Class Big City!?
[1:32:13] <%Heart0fInk> where the fuck are they from?
[1:32:20] <Neoripo> I think Motomu Toriyama, the original creator of those scenes, being i a semi-directorial position for the remake made some people worry. I sure was
[1:32:37] <%arkv01> even ceos need quality ERP time
[1:32:51] <penitentpendant> Foam adventure in a red light district, I mean the rooms ARE cheap
[1:33:18] <Neoripo> Maybe making sound effects
[1:34:35] <+walternatorz> President of their own company they represent?
[1:34:53] <%arkv01> yeah this is the prez I think
[1:34:54] <+crowmium> I think it's a president of another company coming to meet shinra
[1:34:58] <%arkv01> likes to get freaky
[1:34:58] <Neoripo> Maybe another president.
[1:35:13] <+Mekhet09> Different president who has to meet the president of shinra.
[1:35:16] <+walternatorz> Just another business trip expense
[1:35:22] <%arkv01> why does she call us poo...?
[1:35:51] <+crowmium> given Japanese forms of address it makes sense how it would be written in Japanese
[1:35:53] <Dunmarkh> ignore the bottom
[1:36:18] <TheAzulmagia> The Honey Bee Inn is so bizarre in the original.
[1:36:25] <Neoripo> That is the problem when President Shinra's name is President Shinra
[1:36:38] <%arkv01> poochy's a right old dog, he is...
[1:37:02] <vaydoze> all 3 of these ladies: please leave cloud: FeelsGoodMan
[1:37:37] <vaydoze> &$*# room
[1:37:38] <+crowmium> the FUCK room

[1:37:40] <TheGuesty> fuck room please
[1:37:40] <kjb343> hot tub time
[1:37:43] <%arkv01> FUCK
[1:37:44] <Neoripo> The Mindbreak room
[1:37:47] <%Heart0fInk> the fuck room
[1:37:49] <PonchoPronto> oh is that why she says poo, almost calls him poochy?
[1:37:52] <%arkv01> the big FUCK
[1:37:53] <Mathochism> The F U C K Room.
[1:37:53] <N8r_Tot> BUTT room NotLikeThis
[1:37:57] <Dunmarkh> the shit room

[1:38:02] <+Mekhet09> the group room.
[1:38:18] <%Heart0fInk> everyone does the hot tub room
[1:38:52] <%Heart0fInk> dude soup
[1:38:55] <SuperVaderMan> the gay panic room
[1:38:57] <%arkv01> a very sweaty bath
[1:39:03] <Mizaiya> sounds like a good time
[1:39:06] <+Gigagoat> hot
[1:39:16] <teastockings> high risk high reward room
[1:39:22] <%arkv01> whoa
[1:39:24] <%Heart0fInk> I've... never seen this..
[1:39:26] <Flamethrowerman09> Why in here specifically?
[1:39:35] <+Mekhet09> Interesting.
[1:39:44] <%arkv01> spooky
[1:39:50] <+Mekhet09> Jesus that came out of nowhere.
[1:40:12] <+crowmium> none of this makes sense in English...
[1:40:16] <Neoripo> Assault!
[1:40:19] <%arkv01> did he just nut
[1:40:32] <%KellBeII> moogi
[1:40:32] <+crazyspartan214> WutFace
[1:40:38] <Flamethrowerman09> Bubby
[1:40:39] <Neoripo> Mukki = Muscular
[1:40:45] <Mathochism> Moogie.
[1:41:05] <Mathochism> No farengi mothers in remake. :(
[1:41:06] <+crowmium> lolol

[1:41:11] <%daveronald> no
[1:41:14] <Puhff> that's because mukki is in yakuza 7
[1:41:17] <%Heart0fInk> probably
[1:41:24] <+askalta> mildly
[1:41:26] <+crowmium> is it rapey? yes
[1:41:26] <+CalderGaming> LITTLE BIT
[1:41:39] <Flamethrowerman09> Better than anything in western media right now.
[1:41:45] <tolloponik> it's more of a suck it strait virgin joke if you ask me
[1:42:04] <%cosmicleviathan18> nice costumes
[1:42:13] <Neoripo> If you talk to her again, she blushes.
[1:42:14] <+Mekhet09> Canonically prettier then aeris and tifa and slutty outfits.
[1:42:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> Always be wary of cute girls
[1:42:24] <%kyh9> I like Tim Rogers' description of this area: it's a dungeonw ithout any combat
[1:42:34] <+crowmium> the fact he doesn't comment about the make up makes me think that you aren't the first person to do it
[1:42:37] <%KellBeII> yeah, you were a cute girl
[1:42:53] <Eger007> simp
[1:42:58] <%arkv01> goddamn aeris we gotta get you on shark tank
[1:42:58] <%kyh9> My GF was the same way.  Though she is also fairly anti-social, I'm surprised she puts up with me
[1:43:45] <Eger007> poor johnny
[1:43:47] <%kyh9> I always thought the "Aerith is a street walker" theory was funny
[1:43:48] <LVL1_Scumbag> Johnny > Cloud confirmed
[1:43:51] <Neoripo> Pity gil
[1:44:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> yeah babay
[1:44:41] <vaydoze> moon2CUTE what a beauty
[1:44:56] <TheGuesty> bff69 ericbHearts
[1:45:05] <UnsteadyFunk> Wall Market was the best part of the Remake I don't care if the rest of it wasn't great.
[1:45:16] <%sinfullsaint> I love not getting notifications and showing up an hour in, just makes my night
[1:45:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> plagueHeh plagueHarkness plagueHeh plagueHarkness
[1:45:38] <smile64> @sinfullsaint twitch is a good websit Kappa
[1:45:54] <TheAzulmagia> I remember my original understanding of Aerith came from Kingdom Hearts. And then I played VII. I got heavy whiplash.
[1:46:04] <+PleasantLee> what a SKANK
[1:46:10] <Neoripo> LUL
[1:46:13] <%sinfullsaint> @smile64  gotta love em
[1:46:18] <TheGuesty> slutting it up
[1:46:50] <+PleasantLee> where does she keep the steel chair in that dress?
[1:46:57] <%cosmicleviathan18> never though about it like that
[1:47:17] <TheAzulmagia> @PlagueOfGripes I heard that her name was meant to be Aerith as a play off of "Earth" since she was supposed to be a Geomancer, but I dunno how accurate that is.
[1:47:19] <Neoripo> She knows Corneo is a sleazeback
[1:47:21] <%arkv01> that dumptruck ass is a weapon she puts to good use
[1:47:24] <SuperVaderMan> Someone's gonna get fucked, and it's not going to be me
[1:47:28] <UnsteadyFunk> She's not a slut but she put on the uniform for lulz
[1:47:42] <%Heart0fInk> I hate in remake how they gas them in the dons place to move them 20 feet..
[1:47:47] <+crowmium> part of her character I think is trying to forget the fact that she has some real serious shit going on in her life
[1:47:52] <+D4C_Trice> time for Aeris and thunderhead hit up the town
[1:48:03] <+Gigagoat> I can't believe japan did this to us
[1:48:10] <TheAzulmagia> Hearing about all of the unused ideas in VII is kinda neat.
[1:48:14] <Eilocke> Aeris is presented so differently in other material.
[1:48:17] <TheAzulmagia> Oh hey, I never noticed that.
[1:48:17] <+askalta> oh yea
[1:48:18] <+PleasantLee> just spell her name Aeriス
[1:48:28] <+walternatorz> character design finalized before story?

[1:49:08] <+crowmium> these guys look like Shinra thugs to me
[1:49:09] <TheAzulmagia> I half-expected the remake to have an option for Cloud to dress as Lightning, as a gag.
[1:49:12] <Neoripo> Where are the fart horns?
[1:49:13] <UnsteadyFunk> I like how Cloud runs around like he's just shat his pants
[1:49:17] <+Mekhet09> better then the gangbang room.
[1:49:18] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:49:18] <kingra> Literal sex dungeon
[1:49:48] <kingra> Pop eye models
[1:49:49] <Eger007> what are the chances that they find a way to save aerith in the remake? would they dare
[1:49:51] <theloganbrand> Soap Shoes Tifa LUL
[1:49:55] <Eilocke> i was weirded out when i replayed FF7 recently, and realized how much more entertaining Aeris and Sephiroth are than they're always presented
[1:51:13] <Neoripo> If the feet where tinnier you could not see them sometimes at 320x160 res. Also Nintendo 64
[1:51:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh my
[1:51:26] <+crowmium> yeah the Japanese have a way of taking something good and ruining it for marketing
[1:51:41] <%sinfullsaint> never understood how Cloud was able to pass as a woman, an attractive woman I might add
[1:51:42] <Flamethrowerman09> Gotta huff some ether
[1:51:43] <+askalta> seething
[1:51:47] <+crowmium> or maybe that's just large corporations
[1:52:03] <TheAzulmagia> I don't remember Sephiroth being particular entertaining in original VII, but he was definitely better than "trailer boy", or whatever Plague called him in the video.
[1:52:04] <+PleasantLee> Aeriス is an absolute troll
[1:52:28] <Neoripo> Yeah, she is a troll
[1:52:38] <%cosmicleviathan18> Cloud, why do you looks sexy af?!
[1:53:24] <Flamethrowerman09> Gundam has another main character that cross dress. Loran from Turn A Gundam
[1:54:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> good evening. i see i Walted in the Middle of a threesome
[1:54:29] <Neoripo> No sorry
[1:54:51] <Neoripo> No

[1:55:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> Jesse
[1:55:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Tifa doesn't know she's hot
[1:55:58] <zk_nails> what if he's into trashy women?
[1:56:13] <%cosmicleviathan18> Jesse is the hottest in Midgar plagueHarkness
[1:56:17] <Neoripo> You trolled Cloud hard, so you are ok in my book. -Tifa-
[1:56:39] <itsdasteve> he would probably say $%*@
[1:56:42] <TheGuesty> "black man's Kryptonite"
[1:57:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> nah, cloud too much flat assed for Barret
[1:57:46] <Neoripo> I wish they had different portraits for this
[1:57:56] <TheGuesty> lost oppurtunity - shoulda been named Crotch
[1:58:34] <kingra> Has a fuckin mohawk
[1:58:44] <%octotasty> Cloud
[1:58:44] <karl_rex> his mohawk looks like a banana
[1:58:47] <kingra> Tifa
[1:58:47] <%cosmicleviathan18> and pointy white shoes
[1:58:48] <Neoripo> It's a Fist of the north star enemy
[1:58:49] <smile64> all of them BrokeBack
[1:58:50] <TheGuesty> Like Birdie from Streert Fighter, but only 5'4", like the size of Pat
[1:58:51] <GurrenGyaru> Tifa
[1:58:52] <Deimos002> enbPoint
[1:58:54] <+PleasantLee> don's coat in remake looks dope, I want it
[1:58:55] <%Heart0fInk> He reminds me or Carl from aqua teen hunger force.
[1:58:56] <TheAzulmagia> Tifa is best girl.
[1:59:08] <TheAzulmagia> @heart0fink That sounds about right.
[1:59:14] <itsdasteve> Cloud has handlebars
[1:59:18] <theloganbrand> What if he likes it
[1:59:20] <kingra> Yeah it is
[1:59:21] <+nolawg> remake was a mistake
[1:59:21] <+PleasantLee> I wonder if the coming revelation awakens something in the don
[1:59:23] <+CalderGaming> did they come up with his horse neigh thing for remake it was that recovered from the original JP script
[1:59:24] <LVL1_Scumbag> Working for the Don seems like a good deal
[1:59:28] <+D4C_Trice> this has sinister tones for sure
[1:59:30] <+nolawg> what a shitshow remake was, just beat it for the first time
[1:59:34] <SuperVaderMan> Also the fact that this has been going on for a while
[1:59:36] <+CalderGaming> *or was
[1:59:39] <%Heart0fInk> @itsdasteve so it's easier to ride him. yes
[1:59:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> the best part
[1:59:53] <+nolawg> ff7 remake is kingdom hearts now
[1:59:56] <+nolawg> thanks nomura
[1:59:59] <TheAzulmagia> I might have. Dunno.
[2:00:07] <Mizaiya> ew
[2:00:11] <LVL1_Scumbag> Coward

[2:00:21] <+Gigagoat> Coward
[2:00:21] <Neoripo> Cucked
[2:00:23] <%Heart0fInk> LUL
[2:00:27] <FattoCattoGo> I've read this doujin...
[2:00:45] <Dunmarkh> @FattoCattoGo tags: ugly bastard, crossdressing
[2:00:53] <penitentpendant> I love the FF7A comment: "EVEN BETTER!"
[2:00:56] <SuperVaderMan> A MAN?! Even better!
[2:00:58] <kingra> A man? EVEN BETTER!
[2:01:01] <smile64> i wouldn't say all of remake is a shitshow, just the time ghosts and the ending aka when it goes full nomura
[2:01:01] <%cosmicleviathan18> No we didn't get the hip thrusting plagueFace
[2:01:04] <+D4C_Trice> like the tfs one?
[2:01:04] <TheAzulmagia> "Jokes on you, I'm into that."
[2:01:07] <CyberDingus> PixelBob
[2:01:10] <%KellBeII> he, just has no reaction at all.  he knew the whole time and chose you cause you were the prettiest
[2:01:10] <kingra> @SuperVaderMan Ayyy
[2:01:17] <Neoripo> In the remake it kinda goes like that
[2:01:40] <%Heart0fInk> up his butthole
[2:01:40] <+PleasantLee> remake invented a whole character to explain how cloud got his gear back
[2:01:42] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "his dick is bigger then mine......excelent!"
[2:01:44] <TheAzulmagia> Don Corneo has weird sword kinks.
[2:01:50] <+nolawg> @smile64 yea the games looks great, plays well too, but the whole time ghost bullshit and ending
[2:01:58] <+nolawg> is game of thrones esque, ruins the entire thing
[2:02:06] <+nolawg> got season 8 that is
[2:02:06] <DaKnightWarrior> Love this part.
[2:02:24] <+PleasantLee> I think tifa says smash it off
[2:02:30] <LVL1_Scumbag> Tearing probably hurts
[2:02:35] <TheAzulmagia> She's wild.
[2:02:35] <%Heart0fInk> @PleasantLee and that character was fuckin stupid white haired Nomura losers..
[2:02:38] <%cosmicleviathan18> rip and tear
[2:02:41] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Aerisu is brutal
[2:02:42] <smile64> got season 8 FeelsBadMan
[2:02:51] <%arkv01> its not her first rodeo :)
[2:02:56] <%Heart0fInk> or she's known some dudes into some kinky shit
[2:03:04] <+nolawg> hell yea nomura fukin sucks as a creative writer
[2:03:10] <+nolawg> he should just stick to character design\
[2:03:33] <%Heart0fInk> Shrinra already knew who and where they were 110%
[2:04:13] <Neoripo> Nomura is just a Big kid with a lot of caffeine. He is creative, but not consistent
[2:04:42] <%Heart0fInk> @Neoripo He's not even creative. he makes the same thing over and over
[2:05:09] <%Heart0fInk> white haired villains and pretty boys with a bunch of belts
[2:05:23] <+D4C_Trice> nomura can do character writing on occasions but he can't be trusted leading anything
[2:05:32] <Neoripo> Yes
[2:05:34] <%cosmicleviathan18> big ol desk
[2:05:38] <smile64> nomurs is like rian johnson, a really smart high schooler who wants to be ahead of his audience
[2:05:40] <tolloponik> I think it was they already knew the plate plan but they thought it was just a rumor and corneo confirmed it something like that
[2:05:46] <Schuhart> I can't believe Eli is gonna die of dehydration
[2:05:47] <TheAzulmagia> I heard Nomura wanted to hold off on Sephiroth, but I dunno how true that is.
[2:05:47] <Neoripo> He can't commit to one idea
[2:06:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that is one fancy office desk
[2:06:11] <+nolawg> agree he aint all that garbage, but he shouldnt be the lead on any project
[2:06:27] <+nolawg> im so glad yoshi p is the main lead on ff16
[2:06:38] <Deimos002> They're just poor people, who cares
[2:06:44] <%cosmicleviathan18> most of them weren't there LUL
[2:06:54] <Flamethrowerman09> Shinra deserves to get a sword shoved up his ass.
[2:06:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> they are morons
[2:06:58] <itsdasteve> Yeah Reeve, stop being such a nerd
[2:07:00] <TheAzulmagia> Shinra is mustache twirling evil sometimes.
[2:07:08] <Neoripo> I dunno Plague. Maybe the insurance and recostruction are worth the genocide.
[2:07:27] <smile64> excuse me sir, i'm off to voice act in ffx
[2:07:44] <TheAzulmagia> He had a sniper rifle in Dirge of Cerberus, IIRC.
[2:07:46] <Flamethrowerman09> Even the abridged series portrays the Shinra officials as complete and utter morons.
[2:07:53] <%Heart0fInk> Well they're also cooperate shitheads. Disney would kill a cities worth of people if there was ONE person in that city that was copyright infringing.
[2:07:54] <TheAzulmagia> Would be cooler than the cat robot.
[2:08:00] <+ChaosedStar> whats wrong with pony tails BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:08:15] <+nolawg> plauge just salty cuz he bald
[2:08:20] <DaKnightWarrior> I love it. it shows how cartoonishly evil/stupid they are just like real life billionaires.
[2:08:30] <Flamethrowerman09> Isn't the explanation for how Reeve is able to control Cait Sith is through a materia exclusive to him called Inspire?
[2:08:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh fuck i think i know Reeve from Dirge of Cerberus
[2:08:49] <%Punishedkaiger> Punishedkaiger subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey
[2:08:56] <+pectusumbra> unless there's a gap between them
[2:09:00] <Flamethrowerman09> @DaKnightWarrior Yeah, exactly.
[2:09:03] <%arkv01> mmmm stinky sewers, delicious
[2:09:04] <TheAzulmagia> Yeah, this evil plan is... a plan
[2:09:16] <+ChaosedStar> oh noes now they are all smeeeeeelly
[2:09:16] <TheAzulmagia> and it's weird with how the Turks are written later.
[2:09:22] <Neoripo> If the numbers go green in the end, it is worth it.
[2:09:25] <GurrenGyaru> in my opinion it makes a little more sense in remake cause they jut want the excuse to go to war again
[2:09:31] <Flamethrowerman09> They're Jeff Bazos'.
[2:09:47] <Flamethrowerman09> Or Bill Gates
[2:09:48] <+pectusumbra> alternately, they are completely willing to destroy the earth for money. They really don't care about anything, including not being dumb
[2:09:53] <TruePupperKoh> I mean companies in reality are cartoonishly evil so...
[2:10:01] <+nolawg> big evil
[2:10:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> they are Captain Planet villains, that's it
[2:10:07] <smile64> this plan was brought to you by the hyuga clan
[2:10:25] <TheAzulmagia> I remember that time Captain Planet was hurt by Hitler staring at him.
[2:10:46] <itsdasteve> Well isn't this a dilly of a pickle
[2:11:21] <%Punishedkaiger> I'm usually shitting up your discord, but I suppose I can shit up your twitch chat too
[2:11:22] <%arkv01> gotta say it makes a lot less sense the drop you into a giant arena instead of regular sewer corridors
[2:11:29] <Flamethrowerman09> No, they're like George Soros, the guy who collapsed Britain's economy out of spite.
[2:12:12] <Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Companies are starting to bank in technologies that actively damage the planet for speculative profits. I dunno if Shinra is cartoonishly evil anymore
[2:12:21] <Flamethrowerman09> We won't deny it
[2:12:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Who got a huge ass?
[2:13:03] <Neoripo> Zenos
[2:13:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh i see
[2:13:29] <Flamethrowerman09> A lot of rich people have completely unsound logic (and no common sense). Like, take rich Hollywood elites for example.
[2:14:09] <%Heart0fInk> I notice that fights are a LOT faster than they are in remake. because remake is a fuckin SLOG
[2:14:17] <penitentpendant> It would break the glass windows of the rest of the city
[2:14:23] <Neoripo> a 8.8 Earthquake at least
[2:14:27] <Profmcstevie> The plate would have left a enormous dent in the earth and would be felt in many local towns and cities
[2:14:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i know it was not their intention. but the ps1 model with this textura mod, makes it look like Tifa got huge muscles
[2:14:31] <+askalta> pillars of god
[2:14:34] <Mikers29> it would also kill the people on the top
[2:14:37] <+BinaryFireball> you would think it would destroy all of midgar really
[2:14:44] <Mikers29> and everyone would leave midgard post haste
[2:14:46] <+BinaryFireball> or at least the adjacent plates
[2:14:46] <Daxalog> Imagine the sound. Imagine the dust kickup
[2:14:47] <HobbyLobbySloppyToppy> inkoboPartyparrot
[2:15:00] <%Heart0fInk> I wonder if Midgar is earthquake proof
[2:15:06] <%Punishedkaiger> It would be better if Shinra was more evil and their reason was "Yeah we just wanted to kill all those people"
[2:15:10] <+BinaryFireball> thicc plate
[2:15:13] <%Heart0fInk> i guess it would have to be right?
[2:15:46] <+ChaosedStar> wasnt that ulttrons whole plan in the avengers movie. drop a city on peoples
[2:16:02] <Profmcstevie> a 30 year wound
[2:16:02] <Virokwet> plaguePaws plaguePaws plaguePaws
[2:16:28] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> ok
[2:16:34] <%Heart0fInk> These guys have a Hyper fetish?

[2:17:50] <%Heart0fInk> Gud strem. plagueHeadpat
[2:17:57] <Pixel_Butts> this is still better then usual
[2:17:59] <Neoripo> Thank god this is not the remake. I liked the the section, but the placement is horrible
