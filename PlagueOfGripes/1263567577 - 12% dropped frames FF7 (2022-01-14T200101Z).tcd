[0:06:38] <+D4C_Trice> evening plague
[0:07:52] <TheAzulmagia> @plagueofgripes Is VII your favorite FF? I'm fond of IX personally, though I wish Freya got more time to have a story arc and I wish Amarant was replaced with Lani. Just give Lani Monk powers.
[0:08:16] <Schuhart> Like listening to too much NightCore musiuc.
[0:08:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Plague when are you gonna launch the "Purple Cat" NFTs Kappa
[0:08:38] <Aussie_Manny> Aaahahahahaha! Aaaahahahahaha!
[0:08:40] <+D4C_Trice> I like 12 to explore and turn my brain off
[0:08:54] <TheAzulmagia> That's fair!
[0:09:00] <cyberblueneon> 9 is too schmaltzy
[0:09:07] <TheAzulmagia> I notice IX has a divisive art style.
[0:09:10] <+InternetShis> Plague, how did you get mods to work without the game crashing randomly every 10 minutes?
[0:09:14] <BigNaturalMan59> the ass is indeed
[0:09:15] <BigNaturalMan59> fat
[0:09:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Tofa got the boobs and aerith gets the trunk
[0:09:51] <Aussie_Manny> u cheating son of a
[0:09:53] <YakumoYomi> They are affronts unto the Lord
[0:10:00] <+InternetShis> I like the 3/4 3D chibi but not the 9 bobbleheads
[0:10:13] <TheAzulmagia> I just like any Final Fantasy game that lets me use Blue Magic to destroy everything.
[0:10:46] <+InternetShis> la creatura
[0:10:50] <+SkookumHime> good afternoon Plague! skooku2Wave

[0:11:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Cause he deserves all of it
[0:11:09] <TheAzulmagia> Cloud and his shenanigans.
[0:11:18] <+D4C_Trice> I don't like how there is only one all materia in remake
[0:11:50] <SovereignRota> feet
[0:11:52] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kingdom Hearts even
[0:11:52] <TheAzulmagia> Kingdom Hearts feet.
[0:11:54] <%cosmicleviathan18> love this battle theme bo8Jamming bo8Jamming bo8Jamming
[0:11:57] <Sen_Coffee> Especially Tifa
[0:12:16] <+KUYAmoPESh> Horrible horrible uggs
[0:12:45] <+BinaryFireball> this ghost design irks me a bit lol
[0:12:47] <TheAzulmagia> The compilation makes the Buster Sword really funny to me.
[0:12:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Wth is there to steal in ghosts? Their time in penance?
[0:13:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Once
[0:13:36] <+SkookumHime> I can't even punch xD
[0:13:50] <TheAzulmagia> About how it's a super important sword to its previous owners and Cloud is just like "I'm going to smack everything with it and then shove it into the ground."

[0:15:35] <+SkookumHime> I'm a weirdo
[0:15:41] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Hello Eli. How much game play did I miss?
[0:16:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Do you prefer suprise encounters or being able to see the enemies before the fight?
[0:16:31] <TheAzulmagia> The only Midgar enemy I remember is the funny meme house.
[0:16:52] <%AdamBryceThomas> happy to  see you stream this again
[0:17:05] <%AdamBryceThomas> was wondering if you were gonna continue
[0:17:24] <%AdamBryceThomas> I'm a huge lurk :/
[0:17:50] <%AdamBryceThomas> you mean imposter syndrome
[0:18:17] <%jaypeesan> Henlo Eli
[0:18:30] <%lifeofnotorious> do you think that ninja/thief types belong in turn-based games? You know whose power is to use a short dagger in steal things?
[0:18:31] <%AdamBryceThomas> it does
[0:19:13] <%AdamBryceThomas> yeah but its cool it gave me the idea for that sonic 2 homage cover
[0:19:17] <%AdamBryceThomas> that was fun
[0:19:29] <TheAzulmagia> I like stealing in Final Fantasy IX, but it usually feels really frustrating to do in Final Fantasy games.
[0:19:51] <%AdamBryceThomas> this whole part of the game is such a mood to me
[0:20:01] <%Heart0fInk> They have ghost everything
[0:20:04] <+InternetShis> Bless you
[0:20:05] <%AdamBryceThomas> it's hard to explain the feeling I get from disc 1 midgar
[0:20:09] <TheAzulmagia> I like IX letting you steal better equipment in advance, but I would prefer if that was attached to a game where you can better your steal rate. I think Bravely Second had a decent handling on that.
[0:20:17] <%Heart0fInk> even ghost buttholes
[0:20:24] <TheAzulmagia> Oh wait, I had a typo.
[0:20:36] <TheAzulmagia> I meant "I like stealing in Final Fantasy X".
[0:20:46] <%AdamBryceThomas> been watching your ff7 remake unlisted playthrough and what a trip it is seeing these side by side rn
[0:20:48] <TheAzulmagia> Because Rikku has a good steal success chance.
[0:21:15] <Schuhart> Get Woolie to taunt them to come out first. Punk-ass ghosts
[0:21:27] <%AdamBryceThomas> also dude it's so cool that you're using the texture pack. I don't have time to run through this but I want to see all of the differences
[0:21:49] <%AdamBryceThomas> well
[0:21:56] <%AdamBryceThomas> did you expect to see the other sectors
[0:22:11] <%AdamBryceThomas> I didn't wanna get my hopes up for that if only because I don't trust square
[0:22:15] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Dark Souls doesn't let you explore a lot though
[0:22:18] <%Heart0fInk> I Guarantee that whatever is next for FF7Remake t WILL NOT be as open as OG FF7
[0:22:26] <%Heart0fInk> there's no way
[0:22:31] <%Heart0fInk> they won't allow it
[0:22:38] <TheAzulmagia> I wonder how VII Remake will reset levels.
[0:22:48] <godzillamaster> hi plague
[0:22:51] <%AdamBryceThomas> cyberdingus dark souls let's you explore immediately what are you on lol
[0:22:56] <TheAzulmagia> Starting with Level 1 Cloud in the flashback would be good for a tutorial, at least.
[0:23:18] <%AdamBryceThomas> yeah but like... what's sector 2 or 3
[0:23:27] <godzillamaster> cloud and his girls Kappa
[0:23:34] <%AdamBryceThomas> I don't really NEED to see.them of course but I am curious. probably just more junk
[0:24:31] <+SkookumHime> ghosts are petty
[0:24:33] <godzillamaster> you can't see them. they're invisible
[0:24:37] <Zakaraz> invasive memory ghost
[0:24:44] <TheAzulmagia> @plagueofgripes Have you seen the sidequest in Final Fantasy XIV that's an homage to Final Fantasy VII? It had the weapons and stuff show up.
[0:24:44] <CyberDingus> PixelBob A murder eh? Plague?
[0:24:53] <TheAzulmagia> Or heard of it, at least.
[0:25:03] <CyberDingus> @AdamBryceThomas go and explore Astora then.
[0:25:08] <godzillamaster> remake part 2 isn't coming
[0:25:29] <%AdamBryceThomas> I am VERY curious to see how they handle the temple of ancients because of how....weird that place was
[0:25:41] <%Heart0fInk> She just unga bunga's her stick
[0:25:43] <%AdamBryceThomas> it was less a temple at some points and more a metaphysical realm of black voids
[0:26:01] <%AdamBryceThomas> also the weird little purple zmmm zmm men
[0:26:02] <TheAzulmagia> @adambrycethomas Five times as many Jenova headaches. KappaHD
[0:26:03] <godzillamaster> cloud loves his girls
[0:26:41] <Schuhart> "Oops, now you're not even in the same galactic spiral arm. Sorry bout physics" - God
[0:27:01] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Gun being cucked?
[0:27:11] <Fuji808> Hi Plague! Love ya buddy, big fan of all your work, your art, your video essays, everything. Taking a mental health day today, so I'm glad to get a chance just chill.
[0:27:17] <TheAzulmagia> I really have to question the decision for Cloud to get so many headaches in remake. Like, did we really need that many allusions to something that doesn't even get resolved in the game?
[0:27:18] <%Heart0fInk> BAD
[0:27:22] <Schuhart> Cocked. As in penised.
[0:27:24] <%Heart0fInk> It's going to go bad
[0:27:33] <Fuji808> It's the sound of a pocket being rifled through really, really fast.
[0:27:43] <%AdamBryceThomas> oh man I hate to say it but listening to you go off in your ff7r playthrough is fun
[0:28:08] <%AdamBryceThomas> I'm one of those aeris*** guys myself
[0:28:21] <TheAzulmagia> Eggman has a huge ass.
[0:28:25] <Zakaraz> big the cat?
[0:28:28] <Goergorion> Not true, Big the cat is huge
[0:28:28] <Eger007> whichever i want
[0:28:43] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Knuckles has big fist nipples
[0:28:50] <+D4C_Trice> Whisper is cute
[0:28:55] <%AdamBryceThomas> i SWEAR I don't do that on purpose
[0:29:03] <+MsLizard> Bewbs
[0:29:07] <+D4C_Trice> I'd of thought Vanilla had a dump truck
[0:29:09] <TheAzulmagia> I wonder if the IDW characters might ever appear in a game, or if it'll be like Archie.
[0:29:10] <%AdamBryceThomas> it's just how the lines come out
[0:29:36] <+reiface08> does aeris' attack sound change based on her weapon?
[0:29:45] <+PleasantLee> the purple catman likes purple cats
[0:30:07] <%RykerSkies> It's time plagueHeh
[0:30:10] <%AdamBryceThomas> yeah I don't think whisper for instance is EVER intended to be seen in a way that would clear up how her colors work for instance
[0:30:23] <%AdamBryceThomas> it's like the rouge issue
[0:31:18] <%Heart0fInk> notice how that fight didn't last 5 hours? Novel isn't it?
[0:31:26] <%AdamBryceThomas> PLAGUE
[0:31:44] <%AdamBryceThomas> ðŸš“ðŸš¨ðŸš“ðŸš¨
[0:31:56] <%AdamBryceThomas> lol
[0:32:10] <LunarRemix> Blaze's a cutie.
[0:32:15] <Schuhart> Lore established
[0:32:48] <Lt_Campbell> yeah this town is literally made of trash and has NO sunlight.
[0:32:52] <%AdamBryceThomas> i wonder if it's a situation like,: fascists moved with money and turned a small bustling town into a corporate steel night ate
[0:32:53] <+PleasantLee> "its a slum.....but its OUR slum!"
[0:32:56] <%Heart0fInk> The most intense battle nap
[0:33:06] <TheAzulmagia> Cloud even said earlier no one wants to live in the slums.
[0:33:08] <%AdamBryceThomas> so the slums are just 100 years after a town was paved over essentially
[0:33:30] <%AdamBryceThomas> like I don't feel like the slums appeared under the city I feel like they are the remnants
[0:33:54] <%jaypeesan> the soundtrack is an absolute banger..that flute section...love it
[0:34:15] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh no rip Avalanche ztbCry ztbCry ztbCry
[0:34:17] <chaddestmcthundercck> the entire ost are awesome
[0:34:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> Not Jesse
[0:34:35] <%AdamBryceThomas> the perspective in this game is a mess
[0:34:42] <TheAzulmagia> He just took 500 damage.
[0:34:47] <TheAzulmagia> He'll walk it off.
[0:34:52] <%acridpaladin> its ok all the fat took the impact and saved him
[0:34:59] <%AdamBryceThomas> I haven't gotten to this part in your remake run yet
[0:35:01] <+D4C_Trice> Exploded like a terminal montage character
[0:35:04] <+KiwiRedgrave> only the strongest may climb these stairs
[0:35:05] <%AdamBryceThomas> I am excited
[0:35:26] <+Mekhet09> twitx?
[0:35:59] <TheAzulmagia> Here lies Wedge. He was no help.
[0:36:01] <+D4C_Trice> coyote?
[0:36:13] <+PleasantLee> legs are the best part
[0:36:13] <+KiwiRedgrave> rip
[0:36:14] <%jaypeesan> only asian people eat chicken legs
[0:36:16] <+SkookumHime> poor chimkin
[0:36:18] <%jaypeesan> so thats a clue
[0:36:18] <chaddestmcthundercck> wedge got the mishima bloodline treatment
[0:36:28] <Lt_Campbell> i like how well in the remake it established the status of life in the midgar slums. The water gives you sickness and smells like rotten eggs, the air smells WORSE on certain days of the week, and the food is poor nutrition
[0:36:30] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah. That happened with one of my chickens and a Opossum.
[0:36:38] <+Mekhet09> I've never seen ads as repugnent as twitch ads. it's like a way to lose a sale.
[0:36:51] <+alimeria1> attacIrl hello
[0:37:02] <%AdamBryceThomas> hey plague do you work as a full farm hand? like full/ part time or is it just helping out when you can? no pressure just curious
[0:37:08] <TheAzulmagia> Pffft, like Shinra would really destroy an entire sector of their city to kill six people.
[0:37:13] <+PleasantLee> he will be dead in a minute
[0:37:31] <+PleasantLee> wether its from him falling from the plate or the plate coming to meet him
[0:37:47] <+Mekhet09> @lt_campbell it's sad remake never actually goes into that.
[0:38:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> it always sucks when you're walking through the woods and then also have possum hisses at you scariest thing ever
[0:38:35] <+D4C_Trice> opossum are awesome. they eat so many parasites and don't give a fuck
[0:38:42] <%jaypeesan> Eli is a closet monster after all
[0:38:42] <%AdamBryceThomas> I see thanks for indulging. I don't mean to pry
[0:39:03] <+PleasantLee> hang in there mate
[0:39:09] <+Mekhet09> at least sheep are cute.
[0:39:11] <+SkookumHime> family farms. I grew up on one so I get it

[0:39:45] <FatherGreyBeard> Don't mind if I do
[0:39:46] <JoshManVGH> Do they not care?
[0:39:55] <JoshManVGH> That's kinda cool
[0:40:06] <TheAzulmagia> Free opossum.
[0:40:19] <Idocreating> Is this a remaster of some sort? Don't recall the Steam version looking quite like this
[0:40:20] <+SkookumHime> opossums are so primitive that they just don't process half the shit modern mammals do
[0:40:21] <+PleasantLee> old Sean O'Possum down by the quarry
[0:40:23] <robotlunatic> I can't, my wretched Siberian husky destroys possums
[0:40:27] <%cosmicleviathan18> please we prefer correct possum pronouns here
[0:40:46] <TheAzulmagia> He's marking his territory. That's why he doesn't want to leave.
[0:41:06] <TheAzulmagia> Only one day away from retirement.
[0:41:07] <ThereiWas> major death flag right there
[0:41:13] <ThereiWas> also, hello!
[0:41:30] <+SkookumHime> opossums are literally so primitive they have a low chace of having rabies due to low body temps and a less than complex limbic system
[0:41:38] <+KiwiRedgrave> On my last day before retirement im going to tell everyone its my last day and that im excited to live my golden years and see what the universe throws at me
[0:42:28] <%acridpaladin> oh boy a free corpse
[0:42:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> State the obvious

[0:43:29] <%jaypeesan> hes even bent the right way for Cloud
[0:43:50] <TheAzulmagia> Maybe that's what happened to Wedge.
[0:44:16] <+SkookumHime> I was about to say. thats how they lost Wedge

[0:48:23] <%cosmicleviathan18> NO NOT JESSIE
[0:48:25] <TheAzulmagia> Remake Jessie is so thirsty that I'm amazed she doesn't die of dehydration.
[0:48:42] <%cosmicleviathan18> Not my Waifu
[0:48:43] <Nasser_ssbm> Damn no pizza option
[0:48:49] <LunarRemix> Remake Jessie's fun to watch
[0:49:05] <%Heart0fInk> Remember how ALL these characters lived in remake? Because they're god damn cowards...
[0:49:05] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Jessie is so thirsty because she wants to prevent the planet from turning into a desert world
[0:49:46] <CyberDingus> PixelBob I personally was glad to see Charlee Sheen being alive!
[0:49:52] <%acridpaladin> naw. lets make remake jessie even hornier.
[0:50:19] <+Mekhet09> they dress like that cause of smog.
[0:50:26] <Coystick> Imagine the smell, of remake Jessie
[0:51:14] <Coystick> Jessie's remussy
[0:51:41] <+onlystrykerfan> Oh no
[0:52:01] <+onlystrykerfan> Did I miss the part where Tifa spins around?
[0:52:10] <TheAzulmagia> It's weird how the Turks are introduced with this act of mass murder and then just turn into gag villains.

[0:52:57] <%acridpaladin> i never thought about that. where is barret from? is the gold saucer pit just the world jail or did they live there?
[0:53:05] <TheAzulmagia> Corel.
[0:53:09] <%lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes that was perfect comedic timing
[0:53:29] <JoshManVGH> I would love if they each introduced themselves as "BLANK and the Turks"
[0:53:41] <+StromkoPenguin> Committing a huge atrocity and then an arc later everyone's like 'Oh they're not so bad', that's just anime.
[0:53:54] <%Heart0fInk> He h=gave up on his illuminatie powers
[0:54:03] <JoshManVGH> Cheekbones for days
[0:54:05] <TheAzulmagia> He looks so old here.
[0:54:12] <TheAzulmagia> Or haggard.
[0:54:18] <+onlystrykerfan> YES
[0:54:19] <%cosmicleviathan18> first time I played this, I had no idea that I had to break the triangles so I just kept losing ryboogFace
[0:54:25] <+PleasantLee> dont forget, you're meant to like him and forgive his literal terrorist ways
[0:54:26] <Coystick> He looks like a man who giddily anticipates the shit he has to eat
[0:54:27] <+onlystrykerfan> THAT IS MY FAVORITE THING

[0:54:45] <YakumoYomi> Then why did you run over to the console, stupid?!
[0:55:17] <%acridpaladin> its a mini sephiroth bomb
[0:55:19] <+ErrorinBluescreen> is this that mmo the kids are on about
[0:55:28] <+Mekhet09> jackass probably.
[0:55:28] <+ErrorinBluescreen> graphics look a tad out of date
[0:55:35] <%Heart0fInk> Some stoopid doo doo head touches it

[0:56:07] <Coystick> shooting blanks, just like me
[0:56:10] <TheAzulmagia> LUL
[0:56:55] <+PleasantLee> you know. the fact that the plates all have a "plate release system" that can only be activated by executive officers of shinra should have tipped everyone in midgar off that they were evil
[0:56:59] <%lemoan> looks like she's sitting down to me
[0:57:03] <YakumoYomi> Eli, please. This is a serious dramatic scene.
[0:57:04] <%cosmicleviathan18> you should draw it plagueHarkness
[0:57:06] <TheAzulmagia> Oh my.
[0:57:15] <+SkookumHime> the. fuck.

[0:57:45] <TheAzulmagia> Speaking of weird things with the Turks, I have no idea why Tseng slaps Aeris here. It seems kinda out of character considering their later established relationship? And there was no purpose at all.
[0:58:20] <TheAzulmagia> I think the remake cut the slap out, IIRC.
[0:58:20] <YakumoYomi> ?!

[0:59:16] <%cosmicleviathan18> WRONG WAY!!!
[0:59:23] <+HeroSolaire> lmao this is why I only play the ps1 version
[0:59:24] <%arkv01> prez likes his power moves
[0:59:32] <+Mekhet09> i still say this is way more impactful then ffr.
[0:59:43] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:59:52] <%arkv01> when this music hits Kreygasm
[0:59:58] <%Heart0fInk> oh no! Garfield!
[1:00:09] <tolloponik> wait where's the unneeded CaitSif reference
[1:00:24] <YakumoYomi> @Mekhet09 What do you mean? The Remake had that really important moment when Cait Sith shows up for seemingly no reason.
[1:00:27] <TheAzulmagia> Imagine dropping a plate to kill Avalanche, only to fail at killing Avalanche.
[1:00:27] <+HeroSolaire> To this day I dont understand Cait Sif
[1:00:35] <%cosmicleviathan18> oh no, Jesse ztbCry ztbCry ztbCry
[1:00:37] <+HeroSolaire> is Keanu Reeves a person or what
[1:00:45] <+HeroSolaire> sorry i mean final fantasy 7 keanu reeves
[1:00:45] <%Death490> Death490 subscribed with Prime. 
[1:00:51] <%boatzndhoez> stable internet plagueTaps
[1:01:28] <+HeroSolaire> This is much more fucked up, the player actually thinks Marlene dies here
[1:01:31] <cheerfulbloke> t101INTENSEZOOM
[1:01:32] <%Heart0fInk> and then MOST of sector 7 lives anyway.
[1:01:43] <%Heart0fInk> so there's really no impact
[1:01:45] <%boatzndhoez> I think remake felt a lot of pressure to be good
[1:01:51] <%criticalink_> criticalink_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 31 month streak! how goes
[1:01:52] <TheAzulmagia> Padding, Time Jannies, and Sephiroth Oversaturation.
[1:02:00] <+goatbrogaming> This playground is now only the third nicest in Midgard.
[1:02:23] <%jaypeesan> its maybe suggested like that? I imagine alot of those numbers at the end are suggestions

[1:02:46] <%boatzndhoez> more mr T accent please D:
[1:02:51] <+RealThiele> da planet
[1:02:53] <%arkv01> I'm all for taking nomura out of remake's sequential episodes but I also shudder to think who else would take up his mantle
[1:02:56] <%Heart0fInk> ok
[1:03:54] <+HeroSolaire> inthe remake aeris tells them that Marlene survived but here nope
[1:03:56] <+HeroSolaire> she dead
[1:04:36] <+Mekhet09> It can be both.
[1:05:00] <%Death490> the numbers definitely dont have anything to do with my birthday...
[1:05:11] <TheAzulmagia> Yeah, I hadn't thought about it, but this definitely hits harder with Corel in mind.

[1:06:20] <+goatbrogaming> Honestly for 12% dropped frames, this is looking pretty smooth
[1:06:25] <%Heart0fInk> Nah. funni black man haha. Right?....
[1:06:26] <%arkv01> man the way he collapses like that
[1:06:42] <captain_elsewhere> plague n chat imagin46Ded
[1:06:55] <TheAzulmagia> Also the train travel.
[1:07:26] <TheAzulmagia> Something something, Promised Land, something something, random fire dog.
[1:07:41] <+goatbrogaming> Barret...you're too big for that slide
[1:08:01] <+RealThiele> it also allows shinra to create a political enemy
[1:08:07] <TheAzulmagia> He doesn't have time to be introspective and he just goes back to trying to fight Shinra.
[1:08:20] <TheAzulmagia> Also, random thought: how does Barret refill his arm ammo?
[1:08:50] <+D4C_Trice> It's flat fuck Friday and it's fitting as that's what they are now
[1:08:56] <+ErrorinBluescreen> why is garfield there
[1:08:58] <%cosmicleviathan18> WAIT THEY DON'T DIE IN THE REMAKE
[1:09:08] <Nasser_ssbm> They don't
[1:09:09] <TheAzulmagia> Jessie died, I think?
[1:09:23] <TheAzulmagia> Wedge ends up in Deepground and Biggs just lives entirely.
[1:09:24] <smile64> technically jessie and biggs die, then get retconned
[1:09:26] <+NmyLogan> my brother constantly goes of about how wedge survived his fall in OG because we never see him afterwards.
[1:09:33] <+RealThiele> nah FF7R is everybody lives since they were too popular to die
[1:09:46] <%Heart0fInk> Know what remake had that made the plate falling and all the death SOOOO Much better? Cait sith looking sad..
[1:09:50] <+StromkoPenguin> Did Jessie get much development in original? I didn't even remember she was a character until I saw remake.
[1:10:00] <%boatzndhoez> full on denial
[1:10:01] <smile64> nomura is obsessed with unkilling all his characters. started with kh
[1:10:37] <TheAzulmagia> I remember hearing that Aerith died because the writer wanted to convey his feelings about a death in the family he had recently or something, so the remake just being like "Everybody's gonna live!" feels kinda... ehhh...
[1:10:44] <%arkv01> nomura had his ff7 remake fanfic ready for decades
[1:11:09] <ChrisPlaysThing> He's like Kratos and Zeus/Aries
[1:11:11] <%boatzndhoez> @TheAzulmagia Sssssssshhhsssshhhht , sleep now
[1:11:42] <TheAzulmagia> spinaSS
[1:11:50] <ChrisPlaysThing> "Shinraaa!" Barret/Kratos
[1:12:20] <+NmyLogan> he also never shuts up about zacks "power level" like how could he die to just 3 men after fighting literally 10k? usings some outside website the labels his power as "planet busting". he is such a chore to talk to
[1:12:21] <+D4C_Trice> Shinra made Sephiroth but at this point she thinks he's dead
[1:12:46] <JayJazz_> Hot take: I always felt like FF7 was way overrated. I tried it once when I was a kid and I was so bored.
[1:13:39] <+RealThiele> the gay agenda
[1:13:48] <TheAzulmagia> It's foreshadowing Barret's future as a bear wearing a marshmallow.
[1:13:49] <+RealThiele> bears unite
[1:14:02] <+goatbrogaming> I thought that thing was a cat
[1:14:28] <ChrisPlaysThing> I just wanted, a clean next gen remaster
[1:14:44] <ChrisPlaysThing> not this episodic fanfic rewrite
[1:14:46] <JayJazz_> The story is interesting, but I kind of hate the combat.
[1:14:56] <+Mekhet09> if they had done it without the time jannies.
[1:15:17] <TheAzulmagia> I feel like remake is going to be like "After Dirge of Cerberus, Sephiroth came back from the Lifestream somehow and destroyed everything." or some nonsense.
[1:15:40] <TheAzulmagia> Or at least something destroyed everything after DoC.
[1:15:50] <TheAzulmagia> Just as a justification.
[1:15:57] <%arkv01> everyone lives in remake cause people like it when people survive and that helps with sales Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[1:16:02] <TheAzulmagia> ^
[1:16:15] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Plague, Charlee Sheen must survive.
[1:16:33] <+goatbrogaming> That's kinda why I disliked Carlos surviving in R3make
[1:16:42] <+D4C_Trice> the fact that Barreth gets stabbed and then a dumb future ghost was like nuh uh
[1:17:04] <%arkv01> the first remake episode could've been at costa del sol already if they didn't pad it out with so much bullshit
[1:17:25] <TheAzulmagia> Aerith dying seemed like a minor inconvenience in the compilation anyway considering that she's just a Force Ghost that pops up at will in AC.
[1:17:36] <TheAzulmagia> Same with Zack.
[1:18:04] <ChrisPlaysThing> We don't speak of the AC
[1:18:05] <%boatzndhoez> Europe people can plagueCool
[1:18:20] <+Mekhet09> i never got that the ending was humanity died. I always got from that, that shinra was dead and the planet can heal.
[1:18:50] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Pong? What franchise is that part of?
[1:19:08] <ChrisPlaysThing> Without Shinra, the megacity Midgar would have no way to power it's high tech life. I took the end as nature retaking the city
[1:19:17] <bathesinrust> I feel like there could be a Tifa or Aeris drawing in the future
[1:19:36] <%arkv01> twitch vods? barely I'd think
[1:19:37] <captain_elsewhere> man i have the wierdest memory of playing ff7 on the n64 but i know that couldnt have happened because it never came out on n64
[1:19:43] <RamVanDamme> add them to youtube
[1:19:50] <%arkv01> probably why woolie prefers people watch the anime on youtube
[1:20:03] <TheAzulmagia> I got into VII after the compilation was a thing, but I always figured that if Holy killed all humans, Nanaki probably would've died when the Highwind crew got killed and it crashed as a result.
[1:20:05] <RamVanDamme> ah
[1:20:20] <+StromkoPenguin> FF4 was the first game in the series that I really got into, FF7 didn't feel significant to me at all and I didn't get why it was suddenly a big deal. Didn't feel like it moved the series forward in a useful sense, it was just very popular.
[1:20:49] <%Heart0fInk> Wait. You don't have a choice but to have an add?
[1:21:02] <%boatzndhoez> @Heart0fInk yeah its forced
[1:21:38] <+ErrorinBluescreen> you're a calming sound in the background
[1:21:40] <%Heart0fInk> @Heart0fInk That seems sketch as fuck
[1:21:58] <+ErrorinBluescreen> yes that exactly
[1:21:58] <TheAzulmagia> YouTube videos where the guy makes spinaPog faces on the thumbnail.

[1:22:28] <+goatbrogaming> Just make your avatar a big titty lynx girl
[1:22:31] <BadgerBoyDirk> The screaming and absurdity is everything I dislike about twitch. The most interesting streamers are people who know a ton about the game and can help me appreciate it in a new way
[1:22:31] <Eger007> at least more popular
[1:22:32] <+goatbrogaming> Easy.
[1:22:33] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Plague audio commentaries when
[1:22:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> A hot girl with your voice would be...interesting.
[1:22:43] <Coystick> Make like, the sluttiest vtuber avatar, but with your voice
[1:22:44] <+RealThiele> also gotta follow the trending games
[1:22:45] <%Heart0fInk> A bald man with big tits?
[1:22:46] <+NmyLogan> arent they huge now?
[1:23:01] <%Heart0fInk> I mean i know a gay friend who'd be into that
[1:23:02] <+RealThiele> beard and big tits, the perfect combo
[1:23:05] <%boatzndhoez> that's a good scam right there :)
[1:23:06] <JayJazz_> Who says you aren't hot? Kappa

[1:25:47] <0Dr_Salad0> Yeah, that makes sense.
[1:25:55] <+ErrorinBluescreen> What are you talking about? The absolutely spastic style of zach hadel with the Anti-Humor Michael cusack is hard to translate into television?
[1:26:47] <%arkv01> I was too young to be horrified
[1:26:56] <%arkv01> thinking along the lines of "huh, cool movie"
[1:27:05] <+onlystrykerfan> I was like 12

[1:27:42] <+NmyLogan> some far away place called new jersey
[1:27:56] <%Futurecity10> Finally got a Ps5. Demons souls looks great, shame I had to pay 400 dollars
[1:28:30] <captain_elsewhere> well this culture doesnt seem to have commercial flight does it ? so not as much people traveling to far places
[1:28:38] <%Heart0fInk> they're fuck friends
[1:28:41] <+D4C_Trice> $400 for a PS5 is not a bad deal. I had to pay Â£450 for mine
[1:28:50] <+SkyZanon> and she is given a box LUL
[1:28:58] <+D4C_Trice> the disc version mind you
[1:28:59] <+onlystrykerfan> Do you think that's supposed to be Biggs and Jesse or were they just reusing the models for some reason?

[1:32:48] <TheAzulmagia> and yeah Gast.
[1:33:17] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah because it's a big city
[1:33:34] <%Heart0fInk> The BIGGEST city in fact
[1:34:33] <TheAzulmagia> Suddenly this turned into Yu-Gi-Oh GX.
[1:34:36] <PonchoPronto> Ifalna must've travelled so far to just die at the station like that then. Home stretch :p
[1:34:41] <%boatzndhoez> PixelBob
[1:34:42] <shiny_prinny> as in like a different planet?
[1:34:43] <+Reyvierno> She went to the big farm in the sky.
[1:34:47] <%Heart0fInk> Maybe thats like a religious thing
[1:35:08] <Eger007> som people say that when people die they become a star in the sky. may be she meant it?
[1:35:12] <%Heart0fInk> She open hand slapped me across the eyes
[1:35:13] <%AdamBryceThomas> they also claim at some point that it's common knowledge that people know they return to the planet right? during the air buster intro scenes?
[1:35:16] <captain_elsewhere> do midgar people think stars are planets ?
[1:35:18] <+FingaLights> Look at those shoes!

[1:35:56] <%Heart0fInk> She goes into the details how she died
[1:36:02] <+NmyLogan> he was killed when his cover was blown
[1:36:28] <+NmyLogan> shinra called him on a pay phone and told him to come home but forgot he was undercover
[1:36:35] <+StromkoPenguin> Can't tap into heaven for energy, can't tap into hell for energy, c'mon videogames what are we supposed to do?
[1:36:46] <%arkv01> it makes no sense or it makes too much sense and its horrifying
[1:36:47] <0Dr_Salad0> Sigma Shinra

[1:36:53] <+Reyvierno> "Listen grandma, this car ain't gonna fuel itself"

[1:41:29] <+Mekhet09> how old is tseng?
[1:41:37] <JayJazz_> Japan has some creepy culture related to age.

[1:42:13] <TheAzulmagia> Hojo shouldn't be allowed to be near anyone.
[1:42:17] <%AdamBryceThomas> I gotta mention: when I first played ff7 the sephiroth in my mind was like a near 50s grungy psychopath. I didn't ever see him as the bishonen cloud temptress that he seems to be now.
[1:42:19] <+SkyZanon> well we are talking about Hojo so sure of course he would do that shit
[1:42:20] <+Draylle> yeah, its Tseng being a creep
[1:42:26] <+D4C_Trice> We don't even know what he did to Aerith's mother
[1:42:29] <%AdamBryceThomas> I was seeing someone very different from his modern depictions
[1:42:32] <%Heart0fInk> and then their house flew away..
[1:42:34] <+D4C_Trice> it could be a lot worse
[1:42:37] <+Mekhet09> I'm sure he had a plan.
[1:42:39] <Fuji808> Randy Orton
[1:42:48] <%AdamBryceThomas> your thoughts on Reno are spot on for instance. I thought he was a gangly mess
[1:43:04] <TheAzulmagia> @plagueofgripes Everything about Hojo is fucked up. He had sex one time that we know of, and as a result of that, the Earth was almost destroyed.
[1:43:11] <captain_elsewhere> horror movie plot
[1:43:13] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Absolutely best power
[1:43:30] <+KiwiRedgrave> even though you look 20
[1:43:46] <%arkv01> I though seph was a test tube baby
[1:43:55] <JayJazz_> 30 in Japan means you got one foot in the grave.
[1:44:04] <Hasuke> Reno comes across as hella grimy like that
[1:44:14] <TheAzulmagia> That reminds me of how Jecht, Braska, and Auron all look like elderly guys, but they're... early 30s?
[1:44:36] <+FingaLights> Isn't Cid in 7 like only 32?
[1:44:53] <TheAzulmagia> Something like that.
[1:45:15] <+Mekhet09> they were waiting for her to be ripe.
[1:45:17] <TheAzulmagia> They literally JUST kidnapped her, even.
[1:45:22] <ScreamLord> Tranq Darts also exist
[1:45:24] <+CrimsonDio11> wait... not just Shinra its "The Shinra"???? that sounds strange
[1:45:24] <Fuji808> A tiny net, it's a net and it is tiny
[1:45:25] <TheWe4pon> Shinra knew what Hojo wanted and even they pumped the brakes
[1:45:32] <%Heart0fInk> maybe they weren't ready for her yet or something?
[1:46:05] <%AdamBryceThomas> maybe they felt like they could watch her more easily with less risk of her say, killing herself, or becoming injured via protesting.
[1:46:34] <ScreamLord> FF7R Barret is the best
[1:46:37] <%AdamBryceThomas> they probably figured they'd need more time to plan so they'd let her grow up "normally" but I assume a lot of that is tseng having feelings for her
[1:46:41] <%AdamBryceThomas> as weird as that is
[1:46:49] <0Dr_Salad0> Remake Barret is absolutely fantastic.
[1:47:00] <0Dr_Salad0> I love him
[1:47:39] <%boatzndhoez> hes a cutie
[1:47:42] <%arkv01> hes fighting for her future VoHiYo
[1:48:07] <%arkv01> nah don't think about it
[1:48:16] <+StromkoPenguin> Same real estate agent as those people on Friends
[1:48:31] <Fuji808> She lives behind a book shelf in an attic.
[1:48:31] <TheAzulmagia> Ancient privileges.
[1:48:33] <captain_elsewhere> war widow pention ?
[1:48:43] <+RealThiele> shinra money
[1:48:45] <+FingaLights> Her husband was Genesis??!!
[1:48:45] <+NmyLogan> her husband is angeal
[1:48:51] <+SkyZanon> a LOT of life insurance
[1:48:55] <xehanortheartless666666> LÃ¡ maith a super gleoite kitty
[1:48:55] <%Heart0fInk> Maybe this is like a country house. like it's far away from the main town.
[1:48:56] <%AdamBryceThomas> maybe they inherited it from the remnants of the old towns before shinra
[1:49:00] <+D4C_Trice> wait what
[1:49:01] <%AdamBryceThomas> maybe they're old money
[1:49:03] <TheAzulmagia> @fingalights plz no
[1:49:03] <ScreamLord> Flowers aren't the only plants they sell Kappa
[1:49:05] <%AdamBryceThomas> or handle down
[1:49:11] <%AdamBryceThomas> hand me downs*
[1:49:12] <+FingaLights> @TheAzulmagia LUL
[1:49:32] <+D4C_Trice> is it Tseng or Tsung?
[1:49:59] <JayJazz_> The more Plague talks, the dumber and dumber FF7's story gets LUL
[1:50:21] <ScreamLord> If anything Cloud dragged Aerith into this
[1:50:54] <+vandesdelca0> aerith dragged herself into this like she always does
[1:51:10] <JayJazz_> It just keeps unraveling LUL
[1:51:43] <%arkv01> daddy your whiskers!
[1:51:44] <+NmyLogan> or the turks were already in her house and waited for her to arrive. she spoke to her mom about marlene and the why and then left with the turks.
[1:52:15] <%Explodincatz> that no one paid attention to the story
[1:52:26] <%arkv01> don't let it settle in sugoiLain
[1:52:32] <+D4C_Trice> to be fair the multiple writers of 7 is still better than whatever Nomura pulls out of his butt
[1:52:40] <TheAzulmagia> VII and X both have fun but weird plots.
[1:52:49] <Coystick> SIR

[1:53:05] <captain_elsewhere> id say nearly all the FF's have weird ass paper plots
[1:53:45] <%Explodincatz> and it always sounds like MR.T
[1:53:56] <blistexthief> The happy man *loves* little white girls, now who wants some scrambled eggs??
[1:54:12] <+D4C_Trice> I still can't get over how much taller and wider Barret is compared to the rest of the cast
[1:54:27] <+D4C_Trice> yet the twinks can cut buildings in half
[1:54:42] <0Dr_Salad0> Let's hope so
[1:54:50] <+StromkoPenguin> It could still add points to Aerith, logic was never in the building.
[1:54:57] <Nasser_ssbm> 2
[1:54:59] <+FingaLights> What a STEAL
[1:55:03] <CyberDingus> 1
[1:55:09] <+FingaLights> It's a fixer upper
[1:55:14] <%Heart0fInk> Accents aren't racist. it's just where you're from. you can be a black dude raised by a French parents in Australia. and then you can make fun of his Australian accent as is gods intent.
[1:55:17] <+Mekhet09> barret date is great.
[1:55:59] <0Dr_Salad0> Barrett's bicep is bigger than Cloud's entire body

[2:00:40] <TheWe4pon> the the sunlight in the church from a helicopter hole in the plate?

[2:07:55] <%arkv01> this reminds me of that sudden drop from developed urban landscape into favela
[2:07:59] <%Heart0fInk> it also looks like it's in a cave
[2:08:09] <dybia> Aeris is responsible for every spec of pollen
[2:08:14] <+Mekhet09> it's because of aeris.
[2:08:16] <%vizardrob> Life uhh... finds a way
[2:08:19] <+StromkoPenguin> They pulled themselves up by their boot straps, everyone else under the plates is just lazy. KappaClaus
[2:08:30] <TheAzulmagia> Didn't someone say Aerith was a Disney Princess on a smoke break last stream? This must be the result of her Disney princess powers.
[2:08:32] <baronouroboros> It's magic
[2:08:52] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Do you know what Aerith prefers with her coffee?
[2:08:54] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Half and half
