[0:00:56] <TheWe4pon> yeahhh time for stuff
[0:00:57] <TomFrank> classic image
[0:01:05] <+JantDarvus> oh shit a good girl braixen
[0:02:08] <TomFrank> plague
[0:02:09] <TomFrank> nice
[0:02:10] <ahaegotrigger> oh fuck yeah thats an intro
[0:02:26] <mapimb> MORE TIME GHOST WHOOO
[0:02:38] <+muzzle_roar24> No not the Time Ghost rooScream
[0:03:00] <+JantDarvus> More time jannies. All time jannies all the time.
[0:03:01] <+silvery_cricket> Nomura "Quick kill the time ghosts they are all the devs that actually wanted to make a real remake"
[0:03:03] <sad_toast_> Bring on the time GHOSTS!!
[0:03:39] <+silvery_cricket> Nomura "See the time ghosts are bad because they are what people actually wanted, violently murder them"
[0:04:10] <TheWe4pon> love how pat hsa the same idea as plague on the ghosts now. no idea if he watched plague tho
[0:04:51] <eluded_> hey Plague, hey chat
[0:04:56] <mapimb> quick cloud you stop Seth MacFarlane before he time travels again
[0:05:03] <Shwepie> Quality time with Plague. Today is a good day.
[0:05:11] <+silvery_cricket> Oh does Pat hate the time ghosts now?
[0:05:16] <+JantDarvus> What idea does Pat have? you mean just his general opinion?
[0:05:17] <TheWe4pon> ~8hrs
[0:05:43] <Kampler21> hello chat
[0:05:49] <eluded_> man, I went ahead and watched the ending of the remake ... I cannot wait for Plague to get there
[0:06:04] <TheWe4pon> the ghosts are sapping your energy.
[0:06:08] <+PleasantLee> boy is it stupid
[0:06:20] <+PleasantLee> fart ghosts dont want you to pick up that materia
[0:06:37] <+JantDarvus> How long until the inevitable NWF, FF7R edition?
[0:06:54] <arran_throttle> lol
[0:07:22] <sad_toast_> last time on Final Fantasy... our hero Cloud fell through the roof of a church and met his new manic pixie girlfriend Aerith .. what adventures and trouble will they get in today?
[0:07:22] <mapimb> I wonder why they did that
[0:07:28] <mapimb> oh
[0:07:39] <+JantDarvus> One of them is in red. He must be a cool guy.
[0:07:43] <badfaithmaxter> More games should have time ghosts. Could you imagine Leon on the jet ski about to take Ashley's proposition before he gets sprayed by time ghosts?
[0:07:57] <+PleasantLee> she talks like she already knows alot about cloud
[0:07:58] <law240> bruh
[0:08:00] <+PleasantLee> suspicious
[0:08:06] <eluded_> man, I personally can't wait for Final Fantasy 7.2 Re:Union: Final Mix: You Can (Not) Redo
[0:08:11] <CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes pal, how much did I miss?
[0:08:12] <sad_toast_> @badfaithmaxter like with a spray bottle?
[0:08:18] <+PleasantLee> OR
[0:08:21] <+PleasantLee> time ghosts
[0:08:22] <+Neoripo> You did not miss it, Aerith just took it for granted
[0:08:23] <+silvery_cricket> BOTH ARE LIKELY
[0:08:27] <badfaithmaxter> Spray bottle, water from the ocean. Whichever is fine.
[0:08:29] <+JantDarvus> Plague, Aerith just explained it.
[0:08:29] <TheWe4pon> nope shes just a bitch
[0:08:35] <kingra> Aeris already knows
[0:08:36] <Shwepie> It was in the middle of establishing it when you closed the game.
[0:08:38] <+JantDarvus> She literally just said 'he's my bodyguard...you don't mind, right cloud?'
[0:08:38] <law240> she legit said she just guessed
[0:08:45] <sad_toast_> no plague she litteraly just made that up right there
[0:09:01] <+muzzle_roar24> rooSlain Big sword? You're my bodyguard
[0:09:04] <+PleasantLee> I think shes refering to when you meet her the first time and cloud guards her body from the fart time ghosts
[0:09:17] <mapimb> you should have asked chat before closing
[0:09:18] <Schuhart> Seemed like Aeristsh is doing you a conversational in medias res.
[0:09:42] <+Neoripo> She was explaining wile you stopped
[0:09:51] <%Samex_Comex> Oh god what is that
[0:09:56] <+JantDarvus> Oh, the 'date' thing does come up I think. So possibly just later in this conversation.
[0:10:21] <sad_toast_> "it's not a big deal .. but I hate it" üòÅ
[0:10:24] <%ragerunner2020> Hello plague
[0:10:25] <+PleasantLee> I'm not saying its time ghosts, but its time ghosts
[0:10:26] <+silvery_cricket> Plague your just another Time Ghosts that want things like coherent plots that dont rely on you playing a 20 year old game.
[0:10:26] <CyberDingus> Do it for me. I have a vagina.
[0:10:30] <law240> not very smooth of you
[0:11:21] <LunarRemix> I liked it more in the original because it they both just leave the room and it makes it looks like they actually care for the flowers lol
[0:11:30] <JustoAllDay> You're gonna raise holy hell!
[0:11:47] <%JailShmixRemix> !uptime
[0:11:47] <@Nightbot> 11 minutes 59 seconds
[0:11:54] <+PleasantLee> I think buster sword has big number over hi-metal
[0:12:17] <+JantDarvus> NUFFIN PERSONNEL, KID
[0:12:39] <+BigCoffee> first class soldiers are rare
[0:12:42] <LunarRemix> God his chest is so smooth.
[0:12:47] <+BigCoffee> I'd assume reno would know them
[0:13:06] <%FordR> FordR subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! I'm pretty sure I've been subbed longer than 2 months but I guess the "beforetime" doesn't count. bitterSmug shojirKappalee spyCappa
[0:13:07] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:13:19] <+BigCoffee> Also you'd think a rogue first class SOLDIER would be known to the turks
[0:13:21] <LunarRemix> They are so rare that the only one is Sephiroth, and he might not even be alive anymore
[0:13:29] <+Neoripo> Punish him
[0:13:39] <+PleasantLee> just beat him up
[0:13:43] <+BigCoffee> Nah Lunar, there are plenty of them
[0:13:49] <LunarRemix> First class?
[0:13:55] <+BigCoffee> zack, angeal, genesis, sephiroth, prolly afew others
[0:13:55] <LunarRemix> I thought Sephiroth was the only one.
[0:13:56] <sad_toast_> so smack em'
[0:13:59] <%FordR> Thanks
[0:13:59] <LunarRemix> Shhhh
[0:14:01] <JustoAllDay> The Punisher mode Counterattack works decently well against Rueno
[0:14:02] <LunarRemix> WEll
[0:14:04] <JustoAllDay> Reno* even
[0:14:08] <LunarRemix> All of those are dead.
[0:14:18] <+BigCoffee> I mean first class soldiers are endgame mobs in the original game
[0:14:21] <LunarRemix> I think in CC Zack mentions how there were only 3 back then.
[0:14:22] <+JantDarvus> I think the autoguard thing only works on melee stuff, right? Or am totally misremembering?
[0:14:26] <+BigCoffee> I'd assume there are a few extra ones
[0:14:28] <JustoAllDay> Yeah only melee stuff
[0:14:29] <%hgtarras> Its the red hair that makes him immune
[0:14:31] <LunarRemix> Well, could be.
[0:14:33] <GeltonZ> That's why Reno said to tell a more believeable lie, because he knows Cloud isn't first class
[0:14:47] <sad_toast_> they so the swears that makes em' edgy and cool üòé
[0:14:56] <LunarRemix> I always assumed that Shinra was just so desperate for more soldiers by the end of the game that they just grab anyone and promoted them to first class.
[0:15:00] <friggnodin> lewd
[0:15:08] <LunarRemix> Since they weren't as strong as the named ones.
[0:15:21] <+PleasantLee> Reno sounds like the kid who talks shit over xbox live voice chat
[0:15:53] <JustoAllDay> Wow that's unfortunate
[0:16:13] <+JantDarvus> At least they seem to die really easy.
[0:16:15] <+PleasantLee> didnt know you could flip over Reno, thats cool
[0:16:19] <+BigCoffee> Roche can already do a lot of crazyness for a third class soldier
[0:16:31] <+BigCoffee> But I think you graduate from 3rd to second to 1st
[0:16:32] <mapimb> that was easy
[0:16:46] <+th3madness> JANNIES
[0:16:47] <CyberDingus> TIME GHOSTS
[0:16:51] <+JantDarvus> TIME JANNIES
[0:16:51] <%Samex_Comex> The ghosts!
[0:16:52] <kingra> FUCK OFF GHOSTS
[0:16:56] <mapimb> YESSSS
[0:17:00] <+shootbang_exe> oof that's cringey looking
[0:17:00] <eluded_> christ
[0:17:08] <+Punishedkaiger> Oh, that was ridiculous
[0:17:08] <%ragerunner2020> Why would she stop him from killing him tho
[0:17:09] <+shootbang_exe> PISS OFF GHOST
[0:17:21] <%Samex_Comex> They are so wiggly
[0:17:33] <+Neoripo> Canon purist ghosts are the worst
[0:17:33] <mapimb> drag and drop
[0:17:35] <CyberDingus> imagine what those police guys thought.
[0:17:36] <GeltonZ> Plague...are WE the Time Ghosts?
[0:17:39] <+muzzle_roar24> rooCult Ghost guiding the plot
[0:17:44] <gunsrlove> Sturdy ass door
[0:17:45] <Shwepie> Time ghosts won't let you pick up the materia. :(
[0:17:45] <Huntercd> Killing Reno would have solved some problems
[0:17:58] <CyberDingus> aww
[0:18:01] <badfaithmaxter> I ironically love the changebad ghosts
[0:18:03] <+th3madness> what good guys
[0:18:03] <$studleydoorite> the ghost of time haunts me every second
[0:18:03] <fluffy_sauce> not yet
[0:18:05] <gnollAUS> Time ghosts
[0:18:08] <mapimb> there should be a time ghost emote
[0:18:09] <eluded_> why
[0:18:10] <CyberDingus> It;s cute!
[0:18:18] <SupportWriter> GHOST JANITORS
[0:18:26] <LunarRemix> So suicide isn't an option huh.
[0:18:28] <+muzzle_roar24> rooCult You don't die yet rooSlain
[0:18:29] <eluded_> it's so on the nose too ... why do this ...
[0:18:32] <%ragerunner2020> Canon ghosts are too strong
[0:18:34] <JustoAllDay> The ghosts were canon all along
[0:18:36] <oshkeet41> This reminds me of Blizzard saying WoW works by invisible 'bunnies' triggering events.
[0:19:03] <law240> When you die do you become a Time ghost Janitor?
[0:19:17] <+PleasantLee> I'll save you a headache, you cant get that materia until later
[0:19:21] <sad_toast_> if your going to be stupid you gotta go Full Send
[0:19:25] <+JantDarvus> Interesting thing, only Aerith and Cloud can actually seem to see the things.
[0:19:52] <+JantDarvus> Yellow shiny thing not currently accessible.
[0:19:53] <mapimb> i want cloud runs past aerith to the materia
[0:19:54] <Shwepie> Ghosts were blocking that materia when you first entered the room..
[0:19:56] <CyberDingus> turn around somehow?
[0:19:57] <+PleasantLee> go left
[0:20:06] <+Windryu121> Having fun @PlagueOfGripes ?
[0:20:07] <LunarRemix> Reminds me of Crash Bandicoot.
[0:20:17] <%Samex_Comex> Whoa!
[0:20:19] <CyberDingus> it is CLOSE enough
[0:20:20] <+JantDarvus> Ghosts will turn them into barrels as they fall down.
[0:20:24] <oshkeet41> Chandeliers are more Next Gen~
[0:20:24] <Betofall> ghosts transform them into barrels as they descend
[0:20:29] <+PleasantLee> you only do the 1
[0:20:29] <+silvery_cricket> I think Nomura just doesnst remembet
[0:20:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Continuity Condoms back at it again
[0:20:54] <friozen> pague you should stop being stupid!!
[0:20:54] <sad_toast_> just go back to balcony!!
[0:20:58] <+Neoripo> Use the map
[0:20:58] <mapimb> why?
[0:21:05] <eluded_> the barrel thing was JUST fine, exactly
[0:21:06] <mapimb> do this
[0:21:10] <+PleasantLee> opposite side
[0:21:14] <CyberDingus> Perhaps go back exactly where you started?
[0:21:15] <kingra> The roof show's the path
[0:21:19] <+JantDarvus> (There's only like one actual path and you can see it)
[0:21:28] <+PleasantLee> not that way
[0:21:31] <eluded_> go towards Aeris, the other way
[0:21:35] <oshkeet41> IDK they coulda just.. had the chandeliers close to the stairs and have you just chop at em if they wanted em.
[0:21:36] <+JantDarvus> Go to Aerith. She's directly across from you.
[0:21:36] <sad_toast_> @friozen hear hear lol
[0:21:39] <CyberDingus> wait, make a 180
[0:21:47] <CyberDingus> yes 180
[0:21:51] <+Neoripo> go to her
[0:21:53] <CyberDingus> we were blind too, sorry
[0:21:55] <+PleasantLee> yeah its dumb
[0:21:56] <mapimb> the only time when we would want time ghost
[0:21:59] <%JailShmixRemix> Bruh
[0:21:59] <+JantDarvus> I mean map also points to her.
[0:22:06] <%caramello_man> the frustratrion begins
[0:22:07] <+PleasantLee> yeah
[0:22:10] <CyberDingus> apparentlky?
[0:22:10] <fluffy_sauce> correct
[0:22:13] <SenkoFluff> spoopy ghosts
[0:22:21] <sad_toast_> ü§¶
[0:22:23] <oshkeet41> It doesnt help the beams are the same color as the roof
[0:22:37] <+JantDarvus> Map points directly to her and the path is visible by looking up. This is probably not the specific point to judge.
[0:22:44] <+silvery_cricket> I like how cloud is unfazed by fucking bullets
[0:22:44] <%ragerunner2020> Shouldnt the ghosts block the bullets
[0:22:47] <+JantDarvus> There are plenty other ones to judge.
[0:22:51] <CyberDingus> Warning
[0:22:52] <Sokumotanaka> It seems pretty simple and straightforward
[0:22:54] <+silvery_cricket> I guess Zack was a pussy all along
[0:23:16] <+Windryu121> That cutscene slide though
[0:23:17] <$doomp12> what happened to no shooting?
[0:23:27] <law240> ladders
[0:23:35] <+JantDarvus> You're back to where you started but now with an Aerith.
[0:23:37] <+silvery_cricket> Do you feel the forced drama of the scene while stupid time ghosts fly around distracting you?
[0:23:42] <eluded_> @doomp12 good point LUL
[0:23:45] <+Dresdran> Its the opposite of cutscene magic.
[0:23:49] <Sokumotanaka> @doomp12 no shooting the girl
[0:23:50] <+PleasantLee> you cant get that materia until later
[0:24:00] <+JantDarvus> @PlagueOfGripes You cannot get that currently.
[0:24:15] <+PleasantLee> I tried to get it when I go in the area but the fart time ghosts wouldnt let me
[0:24:18] <Shwepie> Time Ghosts said no materia for you.
[0:24:21] <+PleasantLee> that materia WASNT CANON
[0:24:36] <CyberDingus> guiding to CANON
[0:24:48] <oshkeet41> Ghost of Brady Stategyguides
[0:25:09] <GeltonZ> I want us all to imagine all the time ghosts having comic book nerd voices and whispering "ACKCHUALLY..." as they fly around.
[0:25:10] <+th3madness> spoooOOOOoooooOOOky
[0:25:11] <eluded_> isn't the existence of time ghosts making the decisions for them supposedly against the canon ? shouldn't the time ghosts attack themselves ?
[0:25:12] <+JantDarvus> Maybe they're worried Aerith will nearly fall down a gap again.
[0:25:19] <+PleasantLee> from the time you meet her in this church to when you get to the slums her personality gets fairly spot on
[0:25:19] <+Neoripo> BARREL!
[0:25:26] <gnollAUS> Follllloooow caaaaaaaannnoooon
[0:25:28] <Vaiire> Maybe it's Nomura's shitty plot vehicle?
[0:25:41] <+ArmoredTeeth> LUL
[0:25:52] <+illoonar> The Retcon Ghosts lole
[0:25:53] <$studleydoorite> why is the soldier behind Reno walking funny
[0:25:56] <GeltonZ> @eluded_ The Time Ghosts are. They're arguing on Reddit and GameFAQs.
[0:25:58] <Sokumotanaka> XD
[0:25:59] <+silvery_cricket> FORESHADOWING
[0:26:05] <+PleasantLee> ROOF TOP RUNNING TIME best date ever
[0:26:09] <law240> BRUH
[0:26:11] <eluded_> @GeltonZ lol
[0:26:15] <+th3madness> I think she was talking about the time ghosts
[0:26:18] <+th3madness> not shinra
[0:26:31] <Owkono> I missed the ghosts
[0:26:36] <+PleasantLee> lets mossey
[0:26:41] <BillieNoMates> Maybe
[0:26:46] <mapimb> MOOOOOSEY
[0:26:50] <+JantDarvus> @PlagueOfGripes Pat thought these were very upper-class slums. Much nicer than the other slums.
[0:26:50] <+PleasantLee> you hear someone else say it too earlier in the game
[0:26:51] <circular7> Kappa
[0:26:51] <+Jumpie8> possibly
[0:26:52] <%ragerunner2020> lets ghosty on over
[0:26:59] <+th3madness> if anyone should say mosey it's cowgirl tifa
[0:27:10] <+zombieghost1337> comfy plague stream :D
[0:27:16] <+VashSyndicate> i thought it was 'dilly dally'?
[0:27:16] <Owkono> the time ghosts told her
[0:27:22] <BillieNoMates> Well it was overcast because the plates covered the entire slums
[0:27:35] <BillieNoMates> Mana
[0:27:37] <BillieNoMates> Lifestream
[0:27:37] <+silvery_cricket> There was no daylight because the sky was blotted out by horrible pollution smog
[0:27:39] <theppl> Money
[0:27:42] <ahaegotrigger> so whats the lower class slums like?
[0:27:42] <$studleydoorite> the PS5
[0:27:42] <Betofall> shinra?
[0:27:42] <circular7> mako?
[0:27:42] <Jrockoni> Space jesus
[0:27:43] <law240> Jenova?
[0:27:43] <sosuke5> Jesus?
[0:27:44] <Aeonleon> Biggs just looks like I young Charlie Sheen and I can't get over it
[0:27:45] <theppl> Money and Oil is god
[0:27:45] <+JantDarvus> They worship 'not living in a corporate dystopia'
[0:27:48] <ahaegotrigger> Tifa
[0:27:50] <+Windryu121> Literal Gods and Spirits
[0:27:58] <+PleasantLee> the little squat jump animation?
[0:28:10] <red_blaster> Isn't there a dumb Compilation Godess called Minerva or something?
[0:28:17] <LunarRemix> Yes there is.
[0:28:18] <theppl> Plague is a hill billy
[0:28:22] <LunarRemix> But we don't talk about that
[0:28:31] <circular7> at least she doesn't materialize next to you because they can't be bothered to show the jump animation
[0:29:02] <+PleasantLee> U MAD
[0:29:03] <BillieNoMates> nice
[0:29:05] <+PleasantLee> I love her
[0:29:05] <+zombieghost1337> U MAD
[0:29:05] <CyberDingus> u mad
[0:29:06] <+JantDarvus> U MAD BRO
[0:29:08] <+Punishedkaiger> Hoes mad
[0:29:10] <sad_toast_> "you mad bro?!"
[0:29:14] <LunarRemix> NO I AM THE ONLY FIRST CLASS SOLDIER
[0:29:15] <+Windryu121> U MAD ..Cloud?
[0:29:15] <+PleasantLee> Aeris would be a huge memer
[0:29:16] <%JailShmixRemix> Thats a good line
[0:29:18] <+PleasantLee> cutest memer
[0:29:19] <%ragerunner2020> Bros mad
[0:29:22] <LunarRemix> I AM SOLDIER I AM SPECIAL
[0:29:25] <theppl> This isn't that bad

[0:29:35] <+ArmoredTeeth> jpeg window
[0:29:35] <circular7> aerith just pulled a u jelly brah! LUL
[0:29:35] <BillieNoMates> Inb4 she starts singing NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
[0:29:40] <+zombieghost1337> It looks like someone painted the fucking glass
[0:29:40] <+silvery_cricket> cloud just peering into your bathroom
[0:29:41] <sad_toast_> Aerith IS a meme what are you talking about!!
[0:29:47] <KaiserMario> cloud should've said "second best SOLDIER"
[0:29:47] <+cheese_cloud> what ius the lroe significance of that window
[0:29:48] <+JantDarvus> They actually don't, Plague
[0:29:48] <law240> kay
[0:29:50] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:29:51] <+Mercening> It's clearly painted onto
[0:29:51] <+JantDarvus> No-one lives here.
[0:29:52] <+PleasantLee> Aeris is the kind of girl who would send you a meme while sitting rigt next to you and look at your reaction with a smug expression
[0:30:03] <oshkeet41> there's a couple times the textures go fucky, i assume thats some stuff theyll patch or whatever
[0:30:06] <sosuke5> Like bloodborne houses
[0:30:10] <theppl> This is a nice time with Arieth
[0:30:16] <theppl> Just enjoy it Plague
[0:30:17] <BillieNoMates> Probably before the plates were made?
[0:30:20] <eluded_> this section and dialogue is profoundly better than what we were going through 5 minutes ago
[0:30:35] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Have you heard Paige doing Aerith?
[0:30:40] <+JantDarvus> It's uncanny.
[0:30:49] <CyberDingus> Sounds like a good girl
[0:30:49] <circular7> her personality is "magical pixie dream girl"
[0:30:55] <+PleasantLee> I never gave her that ride on the highwind ;_;
[0:31:02] <sad_toast_> the opposite of Gen Z that all seem that wanting to die is so cool
[0:31:16] <Sokumotanaka> She's Spirited
[0:31:24] <red_blaster> Tifa and Aerith swapped personalities in the collective consciousness.
[0:31:41] <KaiserMario> @sad_toast_ Everyone wants to die... eventually
[0:31:49] <sad_toast_> she wants you to watch her jump
[0:31:55] <Sokumotanaka> @red_blaster no this is her personality
[0:31:56] <+PleasantLee> hangings
[0:31:57] <BillieNoMates> Wild West junk pile
[0:32:21] <smile64> @red_blaster that allways bothered me
[0:32:27] <oshkeet41> i dont know enough about industrial/shippin stuff to recognize any of this
[0:32:28] <sad_toast_> I instantly hear crash 3 music in my head...

[0:33:45] <sad_toast_> "you just walked around holding her hand prolonging the inevitable
[0:33:59] <+PleasantLee> I can never remember the name of that palce
[0:34:00] <Betofall> town that is soon to be destroyed
[0:34:03] <%hgtarras> hgtarras is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PlagueOfGripes's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel! 
[0:34:04] <%hgtarras> hgtarras gifted a Tier 1 sub to CyberDingus! 
[0:34:09] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:34:11] <+PleasantLee> clouds coma town
[0:34:14] <smile64> will aerith even seem that fun and flirty now that jessie's personality was given steroids?
[0:34:17] <+PleasantLee> thatll do
[0:34:25] <sad_toast_> cyber dingus üòÅ
[0:34:28] <+PleasantLee> COCKSUCKER MOTHER FUCKER SHIT - Aeris
[0:34:38] <%JailShmixRemix> walk away
[0:34:39] <cap_bon> As somone who never played FF7 it was kinda weird how hard they pushed Sephiroth considoring he hadnt been set up at all in the story so far
[0:34:42] <%CyberDingus> Plague please.
[0:34:42] <LunarRemix> Can you walk away?
[0:34:42] <BillieNoMates> Dont help her. She's a soldier candidate
[0:34:45] <%ragerunner2020> leave her ass
[0:34:46] <$doomp12> dangle for swearing aerith
[0:34:46] <fluffy_sauce> leave her!
[0:34:47] <+JantDarvus> Walk away
[0:34:48] <Betofall> time ghost goin to push her
[0:34:48] <LunarRemix> Strong arms.
[0:34:49] <terminusterminal> Go on Patrol and leave her
[0:34:50] <+JantDarvus> Then you get a little dialogue
[0:34:52] <+Neoripo> Go away
[0:34:53] <circular7> leave DarkMode
[0:34:56] <red_blaster> If you walk away, she calls you out
[0:34:57] <eluded_> i'm still not used to the swearing in this game
[0:34:58] <Sokumotanaka> Walk away
[0:35:01] <+Neoripo> She gets super mad
[0:35:01] <%hgtarras> I just gifted a sub
[0:35:06] <KaiserMario> Aren't these characters super strong? How come she can't lift herself up?
[0:35:09] <+JantDarvus> Hey Plague, it actually ends up being not dumb but look ahead and see if you can see the jpeg choppers
[0:35:17] <oshkeet41> Seph-pushing is a pure marketing thing tbh, he always worked better as this mysteriouss guy you didnt see much
[0:35:21] <+PleasantLee> how about now in 7r though? Aeris or Tifa....or Jessie?
[0:35:25] <BillieNoMates> Don't need personality with tits the size of chocobo eggs
[0:35:27] <Sokumotanaka> You right she didn't
[0:35:28] <+PleasantLee> Or team Merle
[0:35:30] <$doomp12> TFS's tifa is my personal favorite
[0:35:36] <circular7> tifa still has very little personality
[0:35:37] <smile64> tifa's personality is just more subdued
[0:35:40] <TheWe4pon> what you dont like team underage?
[0:35:50] <+Neoripo> It's a bug
[0:35:52] <%ragerunner2020> Epic helicopters
[0:35:59] <BillieNoMates> Mako tech
[0:36:03] <Shwepie> Don't look at them.
[0:36:07] <+PleasantLee> its not a bug, its just not well animated
[0:36:07] <+JantDarvus> Jpeg choppers found. In fairness, they're actually hovering. Just some, uh, very amazing hovering.
[0:36:07] <BillieNoMates> Stabiliser?
[0:36:12] <JoeNeutrino> I never noticed those before and I wish I hadn't.
[0:36:12] <terminusterminal> LOOK AWAY
[0:36:19] <LunarRemix> It's not canon
[0:36:19] <oshkeet41> Reminds me of those matte paintings in sci fi movies.
[0:36:20] <%hgtarras> Jpeg
[0:36:21] <+ArmoredTeeth> Perfectly balanced
[0:36:22] <Shwepie> They're waiting for the event trigger to cutscene fly over head.
[0:36:25] <Betofall> heidegger personally trains all helicopter pilots
[0:36:32] <cap_bon> Stop looking at the magic helicopters you'll make the time ghosts mad
[0:36:32] <+JantDarvus> By the way Plague, if you walked away from hanging Aerith she just goes 'Cloud! D:'
[0:36:46] <oshkeet41> cloud grabs and just swallows a bird, without blinking
[0:36:50] <oshkeet41> hp restored.
[0:37:03] <$doomp12> where the pigeons ever real to begin with?
[0:37:07] <+PleasantLee> I've been dead curious how shit got this fucked here
[0:37:07] <BillieNoMates> haahaha
[0:37:12] <BillieNoMates> She's sassy now
[0:37:21] <BillieNoMates> Grab dem cheeks
[0:37:29] <cap_bon> push her
[0:37:39] <oshkeet41> I figured it was just a shanty town that sprung up over a now-defunct mine or something.
[0:37:39] <+comfyman12> my favorite is when you look behind a wall you're not supposed to and see an empty wasteland, devoid of any life
[0:37:44] <Sokumotanaka> @BillieNoMates she's always been sassy
[0:37:45] <+Cucamabungabu> Man, I really want to watch this stream but I also don't want to ruin my first time with this game. Waiting for the PC version.
[0:37:46] <+silvery_cricket> How long do you think it will take for this remake story to be finished, given Nomura's track record for always finishing projects overtime and over budget?
[0:37:47] <%JailShmixRemix> As cloud grabs her by the waist, and flings her off
[0:37:48] <oshkeet41> like the Rust Belt
[0:37:49] <+JantDarvus> If i'm remembering right, the plate above got wrecked in...Crisis Core, was it? Like it got rekt by the final boss fight in that, which is why the plate above looks unfinished.
[0:37:50] <Sokumotanaka> even in og
[0:37:58] <BillieNoMates> Expansion plans etc
[0:38:07] <BillieNoMates> They decided to move to Neo Midgard etc
[0:38:11] <+comfyman12> Shouldn't this be called FF7 Rebuild or some shit
[0:38:15] <BillieNoMates> So probably stopped construction
[0:38:20] <$doomp12> tetanus slide
[0:38:27] <sad_toast_> hmmm tetnis
[0:38:27] <oshkeet41> Im amazed theydidnt call it FF7: Reunion, honestly.
[0:38:28] <LunarRemix> That's asking for tetanus.
[0:38:28] <Shwepie> @silvery_cricket I expect it to take about as long as it took to get KH3.
[0:38:34] <+PleasantLee> ruined her cotton dresss
[0:38:36] <BillieNoMates> Don't worry. No tetanus in FF7
[0:38:37] <+JantDarvus> Rebuild of Final Fantasy: You Can (Not) Remake
[0:38:49] <gnollAUS> Ow
[0:38:49] <silvcrest> esuna can probably treat tetanus
[0:38:50] <BillieNoMates> Thats where Jessie got the explosives
[0:38:51] <BillieNoMates> Duh
[0:38:51] <sad_toast_> "war head"
[0:38:57] <Sokumotanaka> CID!
[0:38:58] <circular7> they probably did
[0:39:04] <%CyberDingus> FAU 1 or 2 ?
[0:39:08] <Betofall> its was where jessie got the first explosive
[0:39:09] <Shwepie> @silvery_cricket The last part or two will be in a completely different engine and they'll port the old parts to the new engine. It'll be terrible all around.
[0:39:12] <BillieNoMates> Or its because Wutai blew the shit out of it
[0:39:18] <+ArmoredTeeth> Pay no attention to the military hardware on the street
[0:39:20] <+Fatemaster> tppowerFree
[0:39:29] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Will Cid be roughing his wife in the Remake?
[0:39:32] <oshkeet41> Aeris: Loved by Ghosts, Hated by Birds.
[0:39:33] <+Neoripo> It will ACTUALLY be explained. The trash, not the military grade stuff
[0:39:35] <Sokumotanaka> He just drops her
[0:39:38] <%ragerunner2020> Time birds are in direct opposition to the canon ghosts
[0:39:42] <LunarRemix> Cute.
[0:39:49] <$doomp12> Alfred Hitchcocks birds struck again
[0:39:50] <terminusterminal> Imagine if she dies in this game by tripping on a curb and smashing her head in this game
[0:39:50] <theppl> Aerith is a manic pixie girl. I like her
[0:39:51] <cosmeleon> GAINS
[0:39:51] <red_blaster> A+ soundtrack
[0:39:55] <cap_bon> Jessie: NOOO cloud you cant hang out with Aerith I want your D
[0:39:58] <sad_toast_> MENUS!! UPGRADES! EQUIPMENT!!
[0:40:03] <ECHLORD> Plague who in your opinion is Best girl?
[0:40:05] <Betofall> always thought it was weird a tiny village with 4 buildings held a long war with shinra
[0:40:05] <terminusterminal> And Sakaguchi is like: "I wanted her death to be meaningless"
[0:40:10] <oshkeet41> Cloud has 2 hands, Cap.
[0:40:11] <%CyberDingus> Jessie will have to SHARE that D
[0:40:14] <+PleasantLee> it would be amazing if midgar had racist propaganda about wutai
[0:40:15] <%caramello_man> the first pc mod will be to change her name to aeris
[0:40:28] <+PleasantLee> later m'boy
[0:40:31] <%hgtarras> Plague is the aeris lr aerith debate ovr
[0:40:33] <BillieNoMates> Wait for later, PleasantLee
[0:40:34] <+comfyman12> Aerith seems like she'd through one of your glass cups then try to act cute about it
[0:40:38] <+Neoripo> you are so right
[0:40:40] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes from what i understand shinra wanted to make reactor in Wutai they said no then shinra attacked. btw shinra is sole superpower
[0:40:40] <%ragerunner2020> For some reason this area really reminds me of a map that would show up in halo 3 MP
[0:40:45] <+Windryu121> What is with the warning?
[0:40:46] <law240> No it wouldn't
[0:40:52] <%hgtarras> Aeris or aerith i mean
[0:40:53] <%CyberDingus> @hgtarras thanks for making me a grumpy cat
[0:41:02] <+PleasantLee> TOP TIP! AERIS OP
[0:41:03] <silvcrest> you couldn't go back into the church in the original
[0:41:04] <+JantDarvus> Notice their amazing name
[0:41:05] <+Windryu121> Is that a digimon?
[0:41:07] <%hgtarras> @cyberdingus no problem
[0:41:20] <Huntercd> So are there city states in this world?
[0:41:33] <silvcrest> at least not for a long time
[0:41:40] <MilkingEdge> Wu Tang
[0:41:48] <cap_bon> Imagine if random ass animals could cast spells. Try to herd some sheep while they shoot fire at you
[0:41:48] <theppl> Hedgehogs are adorable!
[0:41:50] <sad_toast_> I thought her name was Aerith but everyone calling her Aeris? ü§î
[0:41:56] <theppl> These fuckers deserve poverty
[0:41:59] <oshkeet41> FF7 was still wearing a modern skin of an oldtimey RPG game. its why the politics seem so weird cause it still feels like a 'kingdom'
[0:42:00] <+Punishedkaiger> No government, only company
[0:42:05] <%CyberDingus> @oshkeet41 he has only one D though
[0:42:06] <+ArmoredTeeth> Aeris sounds cooler tbh
[0:42:09] <BillieNoMates> Well a megacorp would technically be more powerful than a small asian themed village with ninjas who wear sweaters and booty shorts
[0:42:15] <sad_toast_> true
[0:42:16] <Huntercd> Then that would mean there was a government before them
[0:42:25] <LunarRemix> Yeah I don't see how Wutai could ever fight Midgar.
[0:42:35] <+PleasantLee> does your farmer soul still burn?
[0:42:35] <sad_toast_> they purchased the government
[0:42:37] <+Fatemaster> Little demonic Knuckles.
[0:42:39] <terminusterminal> Ah yes. I understand what you mean.
[0:42:39] <BillieNoMates> Wutai had ninjas and monsters.
[0:42:52] <KaiserMario> wtf is Eli tlking about?
[0:42:55] <gnollAUS> Plague the bulldozer man
[0:43:01] <+JantDarvus> They had Pain use ninja powers to nuke Sector 5
[0:43:01] <LunarRemix> But it was a tiny little vilage in some archipelago
[0:43:04] <+Neoripo> Tractor tech
[0:43:06] <theppl> The sheeple are getting in
[0:43:07] <oshkeet41> (I mean Wutai was an unsubtle post-ww2 Japan reference)
[0:43:12] <+Neoripo> too advanced for me
[0:43:19] <MilkingEdge> Farm tech
[0:43:24] <terminusterminal> Parent Teacher Obliteration
[0:43:35] <+JantDarvus> 'A power take-off or power takeoff (PTO) is any of several methods for taking power from a power source, such as a running engine, and transmitting it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machines. Most commonly, it is a splined drive shaft installed on a tractor or truck'
[0:43:37] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I like how Plague is just entranced with a bulldozer
[0:43:38] <BillieNoMates> Maybe old ones did?
[0:43:41] <sad_toast_> call 555-5555 to talk tractors late at night
[0:43:53] <Matrixvingian> Farm Equipment lore with Plague.
[0:43:53] <KaiserMario> Do all bulldozers have that fancy chair?
[0:43:55] <+Neoripo> Ah
[0:44:11] <Matrixvingian> Are these fueled by Mako?
[0:44:16] <+PleasantLee> can it be used to just be a sweet chromed out spinner?
[0:44:17] <+Neoripo> Power Transmission something?
[0:44:18] <JoeNeutrino> how many materia slots does it have?
[0:44:28] <Matrixvingian> PTO RIP
[0:44:39] <Coystick> FUCK THAT
[0:44:40] <theppl> Hey Plague doesn't Wheat also explode?
[0:44:40] <%CyberDingus> D :
[0:44:46] <BillieNoMates> Sounds like you should be upgrading to electrics
[0:44:46] <oshkeet41> thats where you get the lovely term "degloved"
[0:44:46] <MilkingEdge> RIP farmers
[0:44:46] <KaiserMario> Jesus, how that cat btw?
[0:44:53] <BillieNoMates> Instead of WW2 tech LUL
[0:44:54] <%CyberDingus> Plague, why are you so fun and lively?
[0:44:55] <+Neoripo> Yeah, it sounds very dangerous
[0:45:02] <+comfyman12> remember seeing a story of a farmer who had both arms torn off and somehow survived
[0:45:08] <cap_bon> I have a deep seated fear/respect for any machine that spins fast monkaS
[0:45:10] <sad_toast_> get your arm in the middle of the field half a mile away from everyone
[0:45:13] <Matrixvingian> Pie the Hedgehog.
[0:45:17] <+PleasantLee> adam savage nearly tore his hand off recently from fucking around with his lathe
[0:45:22] <+PleasantLee> same thing
[0:45:23] <ralphwiggum16> hai guis
[0:45:28] <+PleasantLee> dont go near the spinny
[0:45:30] <ralphwiggum16> it's me ralph!
[0:45:41] <ralphwiggum16> don't be me to Aeris
[0:45:44] <sad_toast_> Aerithpthpthpthpthp
[0:45:45] <+ArmoredTeeth> Aerithhphh
[0:45:46] <ralphwiggum16> *mean
[0:45:57] <KaiserMario> You can call her Eri-sue
[0:46:05] <+ArmoredTeeth> Aeris-chan
[0:46:12] <MilkingEdge> LUL
[0:46:23] <sad_toast_> Aeris sounds better
[0:46:24] <+comfyman12> Gatsu
[0:46:32] <Betofall> no staff bonk noises :(
[0:46:33] <+silvery_cricket> Honestly Aerith and Aeris are both correct its just a war that will never end.
[0:46:35] <KaiserMario> Say Eli-Sue with a JP accent
[0:46:36] <terminusterminal> Did you read her tutorial or did you get distracted laughing at th sounds?
[0:46:38] <+JantDarvus> In case you missed it Plague, try holding down Square with Aerith when attacking
[0:46:40] <+PleasantLee> her double cast ability is fucking baller
[0:46:54] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes If they fixed Aeris name to Aerith, they should also have fixed Barret's name to Bullet
[0:46:57] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes that's why she finds him so hot. She and other girls
[0:47:07] <oshkeet41> I love Cloud's little 'uh' grunts when he realizes he didnt sound cool
[0:47:11] <Coystick> Or when they reprinted Blame! and changed Killy's name to Kyrii the bastards
[0:47:32] <+ArmoredTeeth> Aeris is more appropriate considering how much chaos her name causes in the fandom.
[0:47:34] <BillieNoMates> Zack was a go getter and is ultra charismatic
[0:47:38] <+PleasantLee> Zack always seemed too loud and a party boy
[0:47:41] <Gavaline> Time ghost alternate reality dating sim when?
[0:47:52] <LunarRemix> But don't people similar end up together?
[0:47:53] <+PleasantLee> shinra has the best pilots
[0:47:55] <sad_toast_> my little brother and his friends called elites in World if Warcraft "EL-ites" and it always made me ü§îü§îü§îü§î
[0:47:58] <KaiserMario> Did you know, her name is a anagram for i-earth?
[0:48:01] <eluded_> I cannot wait for this version to allow you to save Aerith from dying by defeating the time ghosts
[0:48:07] <+Fatemaster> Get to the chopper. Kappa
[0:48:08] <cap_bon> Your presence has destabilized them plauge
[0:48:12] <+ArmoredTeeth> Physics are optional in the Final Fantasy universe.
[0:48:16] <eluded_> i'm sure it will be a great story moment and it will not feel cheap at all. It's what Sakaguchi intended all along.
[0:48:16] <@dcn2049> There's also that dumb little "developers have stated that "Aerith" is a near-anagram of "Earth". Which just smells like retroactive bullshit
[0:48:24] <+silvery_cricket> Here is the NOT sphere grid.
[0:48:24] <Sokumotanaka> XD
[0:48:24] <Betofall> seriously why is this the most elaborate checklist
[0:48:25] <+PleasantLee> big magics
[0:48:31] <Flamethrowerman09> Zack had more chemistry with Cissnei than with Aerith, honestly.
[0:48:37] <Shwepie> Helicopters are warming up for their big cutscene moment.
[0:48:42] <%CyberDingus> GALAXY BRAIN UI
[0:48:43] <oshkeet41> Eris=Chaos. Wake up sheeple
[0:48:47] <badfaithmaxter> I see this and get horrifying FFXIII flashbacks
[0:48:48] <+JantDarvus> @PlagueOfGripes When fighting using Aerith, if you hold down square you have a charge up AoE thingy. Was mentioned in the tutorial bit for her.
[0:48:51] <+PleasantLee> tempest is her triangle move
[0:48:58] <Betofall> they want to trigger a response if ffx fans i guess
[0:48:59] <BillieNoMates> no expanded universe lore in Plague chat!!!!
[0:49:00] <ralphwiggum16> Plague, why are you so cynical...
[0:49:06] <Gavaline> Oof, it doesn't even feel good to navigate these upgrade menus?
[0:49:07] <+ArmoredTeeth> Big number go up
[0:49:08] <Shwepie> But it looks cool and if Skyrim taught devs anything, that's all that matters.
[0:49:09] <ralphwiggum16> don't you see that the world is full of wonder?
[0:49:11] <BillieNoMates> Told you
[0:49:12] <ralphwiggum16> And dreams?
[0:49:13] <KaiserMario> Zack??? From Deadly Premonition?
[0:49:14] <Sokumotanaka> BEST GIRL
[0:49:15] <+comfyman12> I thought this was the mass effect galaxy travel
[0:49:16] <silvcrest> Aeris in Midgar. Aesir in Midgard
[0:49:27] <LunarRemix> Isn't there a single thing you like from them?
[0:49:31] <BillieNoMates> Zack's only ability is to catch machinegun fire in the face and mentally damage Cloud
[0:49:31] <sad_toast_> don't talk about your AMV üòñ
[0:49:32] <+ArmoredTeeth> You can't lose if you don't get hit
[0:49:35] <+silvery_cricket> Do you think when people die in this game they will do the stupid turn to lifestream that Nomura jacks off to.
[0:49:36] <$doomp12> you need to have an existential crisis while upgrading weapons because this game is SOOOO DEEP.
[0:49:46] <ECHLORD> what about Gact though?
[0:50:01] <JoeNeutrino> If I hear anything about Genesis in the remake I will piss myself with impotent rage.
[0:50:02] <Flamethrowerman09> level 18 already.
[0:50:03] <Sokumotanaka> @Flamethrowerman09 He did but she's mine
[0:50:07] <+PleasantLee> SUCH A TROLL
[0:50:11] <+ArmoredTeeth> Chadley's voice sounds like he's from Nier Automata
[0:50:16] <KaiserMario> Wait, the Zach in Deadly Premonition was spelled with an H... so it's a different alter-ego style character
[0:50:20] <BillieNoMates> Everything is expanded
[0:50:23] <badfaithmaxter> I have a feeling Genesis will be a big bad over the course of this ill-formed trilogy
[0:50:23] <SilverRoddo> Was Eli a camp councillor?
[0:50:25] <BillieNoMates> Except tifas chest...
[0:50:32] <cap_bon> never played the orginal this is all new
[0:50:42] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Hey look it's the canals from Half_Life
[0:50:51] <%CyberDingus> Chat, are those super stallions?
[0:51:07] <BillieNoMates> HAD a good view of the reactor
[0:51:09] <+cheese_cloud> I hate how normal everyone is dressed
[0:51:09] <Gavaline> It's the fact that you have such a good memory of the original and compare this constantly due to the 10+ playthroughs you mentioned that I'm watching more consistently Plague
[0:51:10] <BillieNoMates> HAD
[0:51:33] <$doomp12> wasn't cloud on the news? how do they not know his face by now?
[0:51:36] <@dcn2049> Cloud is debris
[0:51:42] <oshkeet41> "Some Clouds rolled in"
[0:51:45] <+silvery_cricket> "Some trash with a tiny penis fell"
[0:51:48] <oshkeet41> She'd fingerguns too.
[0:51:49] <+JantDarvus> Plague, I think I saw an item chest back at the bit you entered the station.
[0:51:59] <+JantDarvus> Like, to the right when you walked in
[0:52:08] <BillieNoMates> Not really.
[0:52:11] <gnollAUS> Have they heard of stairs?
[0:52:13] <MilkingEdge> Choo choo
[0:52:17] <+ArmoredTeeth> Trains have those security scans
[0:52:22] <BillieNoMates> the train probably goes all through every sector
[0:52:24] <HiddenPorpoise> Funicular
[0:52:24] <oshkeet41> Probably, but I assume thats the metaphor. you literally cant go up or down unless Shinra lets you.
[0:52:29] <%CyberDingus> Elevatorss. Helicopters. Even planes.
[0:52:33] <+Neoripo> Maybe there is, but that is Shinra corporation grounds
[0:52:34] <LunarRemix> Cities don't have ways to get from the trash areas to high income areas.
[0:52:36] <KaiserMario> I'm sure they have stairs
[0:53:04] <$doomp12> EXACTLY
[0:53:05] <BillieNoMates> Noone knows cloud do they?
[0:53:07] <+psydaku> nope.
[0:53:07] <law240> he wasn't on the TV
[0:53:12] <BillieNoMates> I thought they saw Barret and Jessie
[0:53:13] <%CyberDingus> it's the guy with a massive Penis Compensator!
[0:53:14] <Shwepie> Slum people can't afford TV.
[0:53:14] <+silvery_cricket> shhhhh
[0:53:17] <+Windryu121> Oh they are more than likely keeping to themselves
[0:53:18] <cap_bon> its the guy with the huge sword and blond hair
[0:53:20] <KaiserMario> Shut up, he's very inconspicuous
[0:53:22] <+Windryu121> They know what is up.
[0:53:23] <law240> everyone showed on TV but him and barret
[0:53:24] <oshkeet41> Nah, a clear shot. Might be some other guy with weird blonde hair and a huge sword no on else is carrrying.
[0:53:24] <Shwepie> They only get local channels.
[0:53:28] <+JantDarvus> He wasn't on the TV. You'll see it in a second.
[0:53:32] <MilkingEdge> Hey mom i'm on the TVs
[0:53:33] <ralphwiggum16> he's basically so bland he's unrecognizable
[0:53:33] <Betofall> hey isn't that the guy that attacked the rats and drakes?
[0:53:39] <+Neoripo> Maybe they did not show him on the footage, it's unclear
[0:53:41] <ralphwiggum16> He has no distinguishing features
[0:53:41] <+psydaku> hes also the merc that saved the town multiple times
[0:53:45] <+ArmoredTeeth> The ghosts blocked all the tvs
[0:53:46] <+psydaku> so yeah
[0:53:50] <cap_bon> when do you date the motorcycle guy
[0:53:50] <KaiserMario> Plain looking, average joe looking Cloud? nah... nobody will notice...
[0:53:52] <BillieNoMates> Its FF7. It can't be good by default - ClanKefka
[0:53:57] <+JantDarvus> Like they make it explicit really soon that he isn't in the broadcasts.
[0:54:00] <@dcn2049> the slums don't get TV
[0:54:03] <oshkeet41> "Cloud you need to wear a dress to not be recognize while youre in Midgar, its the only way" - Aeris
[0:54:13] <+PleasantLee> cactuar materia? where do you get that
[0:54:17] <+Neoripo> Or maybe Shinra wants to cover that one of SOLDIER sided with Avalanche
[0:54:21] <BillieNoMates> DLC
[0:54:24] <+PleasantLee> ah
[0:54:25] <%JailShmixRemix> Slums don't have the premium channels
[0:54:34] <+PleasantLee> good, thought I missed something
[0:54:35] <BillieNoMates> Choco/mog, Carbuncle and Cactuar are all DLC
[0:54:45] <KaiserMario> Fire?
[0:55:15] <+PleasantLee> I recommend switching back to buster sword for bigger number, think it has an extra materia slot option
[0:55:43] <+JantDarvus> @PlagueOfGripes There's an item chest back near the entrance to this train station.
[0:55:47] <ralphwiggum16> i'm disappointed with the lack of goblins in this game so far.
[0:55:48] <ralphwiggum16> 2/10
[0:56:01] <%CyberDingus> RINGMAN
[0:56:02] <@dcn2049> Marche again
[0:56:04] <+PleasantLee> weighted hola hoops are back
[0:56:13] <+PleasantLee> exercise and be cool at the same time
[0:56:20] <BillieNoMates> Rude is here
[0:56:22] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes hey, it's YOU
[0:56:23] <BillieNoMates> to be bald
[0:56:29] <+PleasantLee> daper suit
[0:56:29] <ahaegotrigger> thats not me
[0:56:35] <+psydaku> oh shit it's THE RUDE BOY
[0:56:38] <MrHappyFunshine> Punch boi
[0:56:49] <+EpicureanIguana> Sup lads HeyGuys
[0:56:57] <@dcn2049> Apparently it's "sweet and spicy," unless that soup is overspiced
[0:57:00] <+silvery_cricket> wtf is that lady clapping for
[0:57:10] <Vaiire> Rude's an anime character, Plague.
[0:57:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> clever one-liners
[0:57:14] <+PleasantLee> nooooo, later
[0:57:15] <BillieNoMates> You don't need common sense when you are a superhuman murder man
[0:57:18] <MilkingEdge> Put on sunglasses plague
[0:57:22] <MrHappyFunshine> Avoid that Turk
[0:57:23] <%Samex_Comex> Wear a earring
[0:57:40] <BillieNoMates> Raaaaaaaaaaats
[0:57:40] <Matrixvingian> Damn Aerith you're an emotional foil for Cloud.
[0:57:47] <%caramello_man> you missede some BOXES
[0:57:47] <SilverRoddo> plagueGripes_SG
[0:57:49] <MrHappyFunshine> Swiggity swooty
[0:57:52] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[0:58:02] <MrHappyFunshine> Wererat?
[0:58:02] <cap_bon> I wonder if Biggs is still sweeping dirt
[0:58:04] <Matrixvingian> Plague as a Turk with Isekai knowledge would be an interesting turn.
[0:58:04] <Betofall> hmmmm
[0:58:10] <+EpicureanIguana> why is her dress so damn clean in all this dust and dirt NotLikeThis
[0:58:25] <Matrixvingian> Might get knocked off because "He knows too much" as a result of that strange "Common Sense".
[0:58:29] <ahaegotrigger> the power of Purity
[0:58:35] <Matrixvingian> Wererat life yo.
[0:58:37] <BillieNoMates> Special beam cannon!
[0:58:38] <+PleasantLee> bar more fuller, more boom
[0:58:40] <Vaiire> Chargeable heavy attack is my take away.
[0:59:15] <+PleasantLee> TROLL
[0:59:16] <BillieNoMates> Fuck you, Aeris
[0:59:23] <+ArmoredTeeth> How's it feel, Cloud?
[0:59:24] <ahaegotrigger> okay I love this Aeris
[0:59:25] <+PleasantLee> use magic to heal
[0:59:25] <+JantDarvus> Oh that's interesting. When Pat did that fight the dialogue was different I think
[0:59:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> She's been nothing but sass
[0:59:41] <eluded_> she is stepping on Cloud's dick and I for one like it
[0:59:46] <+PleasantLee> use sword to hit things
[0:59:49] <BillieNoMates> She's a super caster
[0:59:55] <ahaegotrigger> Aeris is now a dick flattening Waifu
[0:59:56] <mapimb> why no you 40 potions instead wasting mp
[0:59:56] <BillieNoMates> She gets Double Cast
[1:00:04] <BillieNoMates> Because MP isn't an issue
[1:00:29] <+PleasantLee> I like this spot
[1:00:30] <law240> better for boss fights not mobs
[1:00:30] <mapimb> hoarding
[1:00:35] <%CyberDingus> Is that a MiG 21 ?
[1:00:40] <+Neoripo> Triangle is big spell that charged gets bigger damager
[1:00:46] <+ArmoredTeeth> Don't think about it
[1:00:46] <%Samex_Comex> Wack it
[1:00:47] <BillieNoMates> Shinra has the BEST disposal facilities
[1:00:48] <oshkeet41> Old mIlitary plant?
[1:00:51] <Betofall> it was for the third reactor
[1:00:58] <+PleasantLee> look at the size of the shell casing
[1:01:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> This looks like an ork scrapyard
[1:01:09] <+PleasantLee> double cast is one of her abilities
[1:01:12] <$doomp12> giant bullet casings at a construction site. normal.
[1:01:18] <BillieNoMates> Her ATB is double cast
[1:01:28] <Commissar_Cornflakes> SMOrc
[1:01:28] <BillieNoMates> So you use it like Braver
[1:01:36] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> hi plague, good night
[1:01:42] <+Mugen4552> I didn't know your internet could handle streaming. jk I love your work but I can't stay for Spoilers. have a good one.
[1:01:52] <cap_bon> thats jsut a tank down there
[1:01:53] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Plague, camera down please
[1:01:59] <%CyberDingus> down at the tank
[1:02:04] <+JantDarvus> So remember you thought the random missile bits were weird? How about random ye olde Tanks too?
[1:02:15] <law240> Dump pockets
[1:02:18] <BillieNoMates> random artillery cases, tanks, missiles etc
[1:02:30] <%CyberDingus> what is that French-looking tank thing?
[1:02:32] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Definitely an ork scrapyard
[1:02:33] <+PleasantLee> I think there is lore for midgar
[1:02:48] <+PleasantLee> that said that it was original just a bunch of villages nearby each other
[1:02:50] <+Punishedkaiger> Look at that Renault FT tank
[1:02:53] <BillieNoMates> Well Midgar is built above an area rich with Mako
[1:03:04] <BillieNoMates> So it makes sense as to WHY a village would be there
[1:03:07] <+PleasantLee> they all had their own names but after a time they just went by numbers
[1:03:11] <+Neoripo> Yeah, in the remake seems to be built over towns and ountains bc the zone must have been rich on Mako
[1:03:28] <BillieNoMates> Looks like a Renault F1
[1:03:33] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Aeris is like 'why are you looking at derelict tanks you nerd'
[1:03:39] <%Samex_Comex> So many Moogles died in that war
[1:03:55] <+PleasantLee> thats my wife you're talking about
[1:04:08] <%JailShmixRemix> Her design is super bright in general
[1:04:12] <GeltonZ> You couldn't get dirty in the original game so the Time Ghosts are keeping it clean.
[1:04:17] <boxofhooligans> Wait this fucking game is out? shiiiiiit That says a lot about me when even Plague is up to date and not busy making DBZ videos
[1:04:41] <+ArmoredTeeth> It takes a lot of money to look this trashy
[1:04:58] <Murphio_GS> Those guys look familiar
[1:05:09] <Murphio_GS> are they a common ff enemy?
[1:05:14] <+Neoripo> hold it longer, you'll see
[1:05:14] <TheWe4pon> btw you can charge your triagle attack
[1:05:20] <Matrixvingian> Think of it as a "Potential Shinra Redevelopment Zone".
[1:05:28] <GeltonZ> @Murphio_GS No but they sure as heck were in the original FF7
[1:05:29] <+PleasantLee> arcane ward is all you need
[1:05:39] <+PleasantLee> soul drain gets like 2mp per use
[1:05:42] <law240> MP auto regens
[1:05:44] <%CyberDingus> "Soul Drain''? Is she a succubus??
[1:05:48] <Matrixvingian> See Aerith is telling you.
[1:06:03] <BillieNoMates> I love how sassy she is
[1:06:04] <+Neoripo> Sass
[1:06:17] <MilkingEdge> Aeris like the succ
[1:06:23] <+muzzle_roar24> rooSlain Cloud you are weak
[1:06:51] <law240> doodDed
[1:09:00] <MilkingEdge> Item organization the real meta
[1:09:37] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Triangle (tempest) is a charge attack. The more you charge, the stronger it is. the game gives you sound and visual cues to tell you in which charge level it is. So far it seems to only have 2 charges
[1:10:06] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Cloud is such a sperg.
[1:10:09] <%CyberDingus> `you already did that
[1:10:19] <MilkingEdge> Feed her your cloud sausage
[1:10:19] <%bettysharkface> Welp, that's where I came in.
[1:10:26] <+PleasantLee> she would have become paige?
[1:10:31] <@dcn2049> hah
[1:10:37] <%bettysharkface> I have no idea what's happening.
[1:10:37] <Matrixvingian> AErith needs to nibble on some local lifestream.
[1:10:41] <@dcn2049> it'
[1:10:45] <Murphio_GS> Aerith seems vaguely southern
[1:10:45] <Matrixvingian> Stone Cold Aerith said so!
[1:10:48] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:10:48] <+sal00nn> When does Cloud start liking her?
[1:10:49] <%Samex_Comex> She dies!?
[1:10:54] <KaiserMario> For some reason I remembered that time Plague said Paige was a monster for "devouring condiments from a trough, like an animal" LUL
[1:10:54] <+PleasantLee> more daka
[1:10:57] <BillieNoMates> Its a single gun
[1:10:59] <@dcn2049> it's not too far after he fell into the church
[1:11:03] <MilkingEdge> more guns
[1:11:07] <Murphio_GS> maybe it's just the childish nomenclature
[1:11:07] <SuperVaderMan> If you shoot more bullets than the enemy, you win
[1:11:09] <+Neoripo> Looks like a japanese tank TBH
[1:11:12] <%bettysharkface> That tells me nothing
[1:11:13] <terminusterminal> Orkz run Shinra's design department.
[1:11:15] <%bettysharkface> What church
[1:11:19] <%bettysharkface> Who's talking
[1:11:21] <Commissar_Cornflakes> It's a mech or a robot.
[1:11:27] <HiddenPorpoise> Panther hull with US 1930s doctrine guns
[1:11:28] <law240> MEch Kreygasm
[1:11:30] <Matrixvingian> Did they save her genetic material at any point?
[1:11:38] <Matrixvingian> Was this Shinra's military era?
[1:11:39] <+PleasantLee> I saw a video about a bullpup over under shotgun with bent barrels earlier.....dont talk to me about "it doesnt make sense"
[1:11:44] <Matrixvingian> It migth not even be manned, Plague.
[1:11:54] <@dcn2049> They're just traveling through slums again
[1:11:58] <Matrixvingian> A power suit?
[1:12:05] <Commissar_Cornflakes> bad touch scorpion
[1:12:14] <+Neoripo> yes
[1:12:31] <heytakeiteasyterry> hi
[1:12:32] <+Neoripo> DoT zone
[1:12:37] <Matrixvingian> "It's ON you"
[1:12:50] <oshkeet41> iN TeH TuTorIAL
[1:12:53] <@dcn2049> most it said was to hold it to charge it
[1:12:54] <+Neoripo> it does not
[1:13:00] <oshkeet41> *modulated farting
[1:13:00] <heytakeiteasyterry> finally caught a stream
[1:13:02] <@dcn2049> otherwise it was vague
[1:13:02] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:13:03] <GeltonZ> Nice Time Ghost voice
[1:13:11] <BillieNoMates> killa kanz!
[1:13:14] <%Samex_Comex> Damn Gripelings
[1:13:15] <BillieNoMates> Waaaaaaaaaaagh
[1:13:17] <+PleasantLee> they look like 40k space marine shite
[1:13:20] <@dcn2049> Dreadnoughts
[1:13:22] <+Blucarot> they look like the meks in ff 6
[1:13:27] <MilkingEdge> power loader
[1:13:33] <+Neoripo> Patlavor construction robots
[1:13:38] <$doomp12> they look like gonk droids after the gym
[1:13:51] <+Blucarot> how's the game?
[1:14:02] <sosuke5> yes
[1:14:05] <+Blucarot> it's stopped Hasn't it?
[1:14:06] <cap_bon> Local school builds mackie mech LUL
[1:14:09] <HiddenPorpoise> It switched to floods
[1:14:11] <Matrixvingian> This was the Congolese mecha?
[1:14:22] <+Neoripo> News don't care about good news
[1:14:24] <%bettysharkface> It stopped last month, recovery is a complicated thing.
[1:14:25] <+Neoripo> Oh
[1:14:28] <BillieNoMates> Well floods > fire in the elemental tree
[1:14:31] <+PleasantLee> the only way you would hear about the australia fire is if it was burning covid
[1:14:32] <MilkingEdge> switch to covid now
[1:14:34] <BillieNoMates> So don't worry, it self solved
[1:14:36] <Matrixvingian> Ultimate SOLDIER warriors.
[1:14:36] <%FordR> Royal gate
[1:14:39] <+Neoripo> Wutai turf?
[1:14:43] <+Windryu121> Dragon stuff mate
[1:14:55] <+Jumpie8> it's like a nice home in the slums
[1:15:04] <cap_bon> Also Krakatoa started rumbling today as well plague
[1:15:13] <+PleasantLee> fuck the land, what about the coral
[1:15:27] <Matrixvingian> Who paid for a super fancy restaurant gate in the junk yard?
[1:15:36] <@dcn2049> what the hell is that
[1:15:38] <%bettysharkface> There's been a significant level of fucked happening here for a while. I dunno. Eat the rich I guess.
[1:15:42] <KaiserMario> Wait, what's up with the chinese being in this fictional world?
[1:15:45] <terminusterminal> She can drain souls?
[1:15:50] <Huntercd> A pile trash is a monster?
[1:16:04] <@dcn2049> tuba freak
[1:16:18] <Matrixvingian> Tu-Bot
[1:16:18] <MilkingEdge> smogger
[1:16:34] <Matrixvingian> It's trying its best!
[1:16:36] <+PleasantLee> that death explosion blew my ass up earlier
[1:16:50] <law240> 700 damage when it blew up
[1:16:51] <@dcn2049> Plague loves garbage
[1:17:12] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes Pay attention to the sound while charging, that gives you the clue of when to stop holding
[1:17:59] <%FordR> Wall street one
[1:18:08] <$doomp12> you know what? im glad there hasn't been a sephiroth flashback.
[1:18:17] <%FordR> Forget what it was called
[1:18:25] <%bettysharkface> Too nice for our own good.
[1:18:25] <+Jumpie8> yeah i remember that
[1:18:27] <law240> occupy wall street?
[1:18:31] <@dcn2049> It's gotten a lot of strength, but what can you do against the top class
[1:18:32] <%FordR> occupy yea
[1:18:38] <ahaegotrigger> thats unfortunate
[1:18:57] <Shwepie> Occupy Wall Street fell apart to internal politics and then the left overs aren't strong or organized enough to actually do anything.
[1:19:03] <KaiserMario> Last time people ate the rich was when Napoleon wanted to take France for himself
[1:19:15] <BillieNoMates> Because the people doing shit like Occupy are already rich enough that if their little demo does nothing, they lose nothing
[1:19:18] <%FordR> It didn't work out too well for France tbh.
[1:19:25] <MilkingEdge> aeris backseat driver
[1:19:29] <BillieNoMates> It's not poor people and desperation
[1:19:43] <+Neoripo> You can also look for the small gusts of wind and ilumination. i know it's problematic while streaming
[1:20:00] <MilkingEdge> omg people do things
[1:20:11] <@dcn2049> Time for big murder
[1:20:19] <$doomp12> remember Samuel Doe? yeah me neither
[1:20:25] <gnollAUS> But they do riot against free speech activists
[1:20:27] <BillieNoMates> Not even a pity blowjob
[1:20:27] <+illoonar> History repeats itself
[1:20:31] <%FordR> I mean. That was pretty usual for the US...up until the...80s?
[1:20:36] <+ArmoredTeeth> Cloud's getting paid in exposure
[1:20:40] <BillieNoMates> Just association with Aeris is a date by her standards
[1:20:41] <+Neoripo> Getting paid non-stop
[1:20:52] <+HawkGoggles2> Big Ditz.
[1:20:52] <%JailShmixRemix> Revolution!
[1:20:57] <SuperVaderMan> Sassy child
[1:21:08] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Don't forget about the Armenian Genocide
[1:21:08] <HiddenPorpoise> Until Reagan you could just bomb anyone and still get tenure
[1:21:09] <Commissar_Cornflakes> "Ah."
[1:21:10] <LunarRemix> She made Cloud crossdress, why do people think she's a saint?
[1:21:12] <Matrixvingian> You're on the list now Plague. Operation Freedom Eye has just pinged Bezos.
[1:21:18] <@dcn2049> Those caution striped barrels need to be cut
[1:21:24] <cap_bon> Always gotta be careful could be ottomans I mean turks around
[1:21:36] <%IceAge70> Escapin the church?
[1:21:37] <Matrixvingian> She has a personality?
[1:21:44] <KaiserMario> Just so you know Plague, the tomboy-ish shrine maiden is also an old trope
[1:21:52] <oshkeet41> Pink and a dress Lunar. Which is weird cause being the cutesylooking one but being tough/snarky is basically an old trope now too. Like tomboy princesses.
[1:22:09] <+Neoripo> compilation did not get the characters
[1:22:09] <Matrixvingian> What ISN'T a trope?
[1:22:27] <Matrixvingian> In terms of anything in the human experience being an original work and not a rebuilt narrative?
[1:22:45] <LunarRemix> Kind of like ol' DBZ characters?
[1:22:46] <oshkeet41> nope. :v welcome to literature.
[1:22:48] <+Neoripo> similar
[1:22:54] <%bettysharkface> Reminds me of FLCL
[1:22:55] <Matrixvingian> A level 3 Civilian!
[1:22:57] <MilkingEdge> getaway truck
[1:23:15] <$doomp12> that truck looks vaguely like a kettenkrad
[1:23:18] <KaiserMario> @Matrixvingian Pople farting in dramatic scenes, like in a funeral setting
[1:23:25] <terminusterminal> A priceless wrench?
[1:23:35] <BillieNoMates> Aerith was just taking you on a date
[1:23:42] <snowmanse> No, there is a small shanty town after the road from Aerith's house
[1:23:46] <MilkingEdge> peasant TV
[1:23:46] <+Neoripo> Yeah, here it's actually a sector
[1:23:54] <cap_bon> the small moments seem good but every now and again time ghosts and sephiroth
[1:23:55] <Commissar_Cornflakes> FUCKING RAW
[1:23:56] <oshkeet41> Thats a really clean and clear outside monitor.
[1:24:03] <+ArmoredTeeth> They were waiting for you LUL
[1:24:04] <+Jumpie8> LUL
[1:24:06] <law240> I"M COOMINGG!!!!
[1:24:10] <+PleasantLee> blah blah blah step on me blah blah
[1:24:10] <BillieNoMates> FOREIGN DEVILS
[1:24:16] <BillieNoMates> Oh hey its Tits
[1:24:35] <MilkingEdge> booby
[1:24:42] <+Fatemaster> tppowerFree Nothing is wrong at all!
[1:24:42] <%FordR> Quistis's sister? Twice removed?

[1:26:46] <cap_bon> I just blew up a reactor kid how bout you
[1:26:51] <+Fatemaster> For enough money, he will catch you if you jump.
[1:27:03] <sosuke5> what's with those kids hair?

[1:28:11] <+aspirationdeath> @neoripo also having aspergers. probably moreso that
[1:28:18] <Matrixvingian> That guy an ex Shinra employee? I'm more worried as to how he found a lab coat.
[1:28:27] <+Neoripo> It makes more sense that only growing in aeris's house
[1:28:30] <BillieNoMates> Wedge is pretty handsome too
[1:28:33] <SilverRoddo> Village hidden in the trash.
[1:28:34] <snowmanse> Are you implying that Wedge isn't pretty?

[1:28:48] <@dcn2049> Shinra's social relations department demands it

[1:29:49] <+Fatemaster> Goku didn't need hair gel, perhaps Cloud is an alien.
[1:29:53] <BillieNoMates> Aerith is an /ss/ specialist
[1:29:53] <Matrixvingian> Dat smock.
[1:30:03] <KaiserMario> Yes, i've been annoyed by how there's zero understanding about how poor people actually look like, but then again, nobody in this game looks like a real human being
[1:30:12] <Matrixvingian> Dat moogle sketch.
[1:30:15] <MilkingEdge> he ate it

[1:30:50] <Matrixvingian> I ATE it.
[1:30:57] <GeltonZ> I like Snap Dragons because you can make puppets out of them and I am a child.
[1:31:00] <oshkeet41> `~Lifestream farts~
[1:31:02] <Matrixvingian> Aerith is busting balls like a champ here.
[1:31:05] <$doomp12> she is the 1%
[1:31:10] <Shwepie> Because she's an Ancient and farts lifestream out.
[1:31:11] <%CyberDingus> Eli, she is so nice and pure that FLOWERS grow around her!
[1:31:27] <Matrixvingian> She's the only person crazy enough to live there?
[1:31:35] <BillieNoMates> So she lives in a literal mansion
[1:31:39] <terminusterminal> This place looks like it costs millions. What the hell?
[1:31:40] <BillieNoMates> and everyone else lives in a ghetto
[1:31:40] <LunarRemix> Man this place is really pretty.
[1:31:42] <BillieNoMates> What a cunt
[1:31:43] <gnollAUS> Or that clean
[1:31:45] <SuperVaderMan> This perfectly idyllic little house LUL
[1:31:46] <HyperBomb21> I wish I lived in this house

[1:31:56] <gnollAUS> LIke, it looks like she live son the plate
[1:32:02] <GeltonZ> XD That's a very Plague way of putting it
[1:32:03] <SilverRoddo> Rich fertilizer helps flowers grow.
[1:32:05] <BillieNoMates> Rude came by to get a nights work
[1:32:06] <%CyberDingus> Elmyra looks nice
[1:32:08] <oshkeet41> Takes a dump outside, sunflowwers up the next day
[1:32:10] <HyperBomb21> This is the most beautiful house
[1:32:12] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Do people introduce their mothers by name like that?
[1:32:16] <Matrixvingian> Yeah thats a pretty amazing village CHief sorta place.
[1:32:16] <KaiserMario> She lives in a very Ghibli style place
[1:32:24] <+Punishedkaiger> I really don't think you can explain how this idyllic mountain home could exist right next to a slum town
[1:32:32] <Matrixvingian> They might even be able to get hydro electric power from that.
[1:32:34] <$doomp12> her mom looks like she has been hitting the cigs a little, otherwise she's nice
[1:32:48] <BillieNoMates> I like the idea that Aerith just beats the shit out of Rude every time
[1:32:49] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud is a serious dork
[1:32:50] <Matrixvingian> "This is a heavily armed pretty boy I brought home mom."
[1:32:53] <+Fatemaster> Not my real mom!
[1:32:54] <MilkingEdge> You dont know me
[1:32:54] <oshkeet41> Cloud exists to be bullied by women.
[1:33:00] <KaiserMario> "bitch, you don't know shit"
[1:33:03] <BillieNoMates> "Get dicked, Aerith."
[1:33:06] <%CyberDingus> "And flatten his dick, dear daughter"
[1:33:09] <BillieNoMates> "You need to have kids"

[1:34:24] <SilverRoddo> Stuffed pumpkin pie
[1:34:26] <$Rivalshotzgp> This chapter makes me not want to play the game
[1:34:26] <KaiserMario> Remember kids: your virginity is special because you only have one, so make sure to charge extra for it!
[1:34:28] <taquito_blade> hey Plague, how you enjoying FF7?
[1:34:34] <cap_bon> I dont trust me either
[1:34:51] <+LordSDB> Hey plague how do you feel about Aerith so far?
[1:35:01] <oshkeet41> We had one of those, lasted for 16 years and we tossed it. i dont think it actually stopped working either.
[1:35:04] <Matrixvingian> Dat CRT!
[1:35:07] <Murphio_GS> Plague are you saying you want to live in?
[1:35:10] <cap_bon> this makes mansion look like garbage
[1:35:11] <taquito_blade> like custom made everything
[1:35:12] <BillieNoMates> Its a brothel
[1:35:12] <Matrixvingian> Fantasy world nostalgia.
[1:35:14] <%Samex_Comex> Damn already moving in
[1:35:16] <+aspirationdeath> @rivalshotzgp most of the sidequests in this are a drag
[1:35:20] <oshkeet41> was just bangedu p to hell, including the glass
[1:35:31] <Matrixvingian> Kick some vases open.
[1:35:42] <Matrixvingian> Look for that loot.
[1:35:47] <+poodo89> how many hidden keyblades have you found?
[1:36:00] <Matrixvingian> Who is mom beholden to in order to secure this land?
[1:36:03] <+aspirationdeath> @rivalshotzgp and sector 5s feel particularly bad
[1:36:20] <Matrixvingian> Adoptive dad some sort of big man in lower Midgar?
[1:36:29] <MilkingEdge> steal her pantsu
[1:36:33] <cap_bon> How many times has Nomura slapped you with his dick so far
[1:36:36] <framewindowcleaner> I'm already seeing people defend the time ghosts, I'm losing my shit
[1:36:38] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Cloud it's a fucking basket
[1:36:50] <SilverRoddo> panicBasket
[1:36:54] <BillieNoMates> "Take this basket and let me waste some of your assumedly limited time due to being SOLDIER"
[1:36:54] <+poodo89> wait time ghost?
[1:37:07] <HyperBomb21> uh where are the time ghosts?
[1:37:12] <BillieNoMates> I fucking enjoy mould
[1:37:13] <Matrixvingian> Goofy and Donald roll up out of nowhere.
[1:37:16] <+PleasantLee> stinky too if you dont care for it
[1:37:21] <oshkeet41> Ponds in NJ = mosquito heaveb
[1:37:23] <MilkingEdge> mozzie breeding grounds
[1:37:24] <BillieNoMates> and bugs
[1:37:25] <+Neoripo> So many mosquitoes
[1:37:33] <%ragerunner2020> yes water near your house is awful especially a slow moving creek
[1:37:34] <taquito_blade> oh god mosquitoes instantly popped into my head the moment you mentioned bites
[1:37:36] <+ArmoredTeeth> flower tutorial
[1:37:36] <HiddenPorpoise> It's fine if you add fish
[1:37:39] <+poodo89> man get this beta ass cloud out of here, where's my alpha chad yozora at?
[1:37:46] <cap_bon> I've got it on good authority from a Finn that summer near lots of lakes sucks ass
[1:37:46] <BillieNoMates> Just get the dandelions so the kids piss the bed endlessly
[1:37:47] <+poodo89> says nomura
[1:37:51] <$doomp12> so many mosquitoes, and wasps, it's hell, even just a pool is miserable
[1:37:51] <SilverRoddo> Chug that swamp, it‚Äôs Grunch week
[1:37:58] <%hgtarras> Oh boy
[1:38:02] <BillieNoMates> Basket of weeds
[1:38:02] <Matrixvingian> MAybe they breed fish and capture the Midgar flies for extra protein?
[1:38:14] <Matrixvingian> He's actually a person cosplaying as Cloud for Halloween.
[1:38:24] <+PleasantLee> it doesnt matter, you have to pick 4 and theres only 4 options
[1:38:27] <+aspirationdeath> @framewindowcleaner time ghosts are a dumb and unnecessary added contrivance but its really not that bad if youre not super protective of what is kindof a stupid story anyway. ff stories dont ever hold up to scrutiny
[1:39:18] <SilverRoddo> Morning glory
[1:39:35] <HyperBomb21> Nope. no real choices here
[1:39:35] <%CyberDingus> Pick the 3rd
[1:39:38] <+PleasantLee> foxtail
[1:39:38] <BillieNoMates> Its just grass LUL
[1:39:42] <%hgtarras> Aerith seems special
[1:40:08] <BillieNoMates> Aerith doesnt care if it ruins the house
[1:40:17] <BillieNoMates> She'll blame it on you
[1:40:19] <%CyberDingus> They say - if you want to know how a girl will age - take a look at her mother
[1:40:24] <framewindowcleaner> @aspirationdeath No videogame story holds up, doesn't mean I like seeing other people shit on them.
[1:40:25] <%CyberDingus> Aerith's mom looks a bit stern.
[1:40:32] <HyperBomb21> i mean, there are so many other pretty flowers but you only get those three
[1:40:49] <SilverRoddo> She‚Äôs stern, stern but fair.
[1:41:11] <%CyberDingus> Harsh but fair mistress type eh?
[1:41:28] <LunarRemix> Not if their parents were smokers.
[1:41:44] <+PleasantLee> they dont get rain, they're under the plate
[1:41:50] <oshkeet41> i mean the house having issues like that would probably exlain why no one else wants to live there
[1:41:50] <+Neoripo> I mean, there is the plate, so no rain
[1:42:11] <+Jumpie8> you go out in public? Kappa
[1:42:12] <%CyberDingus> because Japan
[1:42:13] <Huntercd> Because you I now think about mundane thinks in video game
[1:42:14] <jbrachob> JAPAN
[1:42:16] <+ArmoredTeeth> Exposure bucks
[1:42:22] <Sol_Install> japan yet
[1:42:24] <oshkeet41> rationale for gated subquests
[1:42:26] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Why is Cloud being such a bitch about this anyway
[1:42:28] <law240> You're a merc after all
[1:42:31] <arran_throttle> This is so nice and so peaceful i don't even want to mustrubate Kappa
[1:42:50] <emptyantics> The fact that you over analyze everything is charming
[1:42:51] <+nerdbayne> nerdbayne subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:42:51] <HyperBomb21> @Commissar_Cornflakes because picking flowers isnt cool
[1:43:01] <SilverRoddo> I should open an agency, an oddjobs agency.
[1:43:04] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah but he's already not cool.
[1:43:11] <HyperBomb21> shh
[1:43:34] <cap_bon> wouldnt all the moisture be pulled up with heat and condense on the underneath the plate
[1:43:40] <+ArmoredTeeth> If they're nice enough, maybe the plate filters the rain before sending it down
[1:43:46] <LunarRemix> Hah
[1:43:48] <LunarRemix> As if
[1:43:50] <SilverRoddo> It‚Äôs good that those plants get enough sunlight.
[1:43:55] <@dcn2049> Slum rain is pee
[1:44:00] <gnollAUS> I doubt they would filter it.
[1:44:00] <Huntercd> Why do the NPCs look like they are from different eras?
[1:44:07] <gnollAUS> That would be a nice thing to do.
[1:44:08] <+Neoripo> I think it drains in the reactors and the shinra building. That is my take
[1:44:13] <HyperBomb21> birds folr scale
[1:44:18] <%nerdbayne> butterfinger played a commercial before your stream letting me know i would have the ultimate final fantasy experiance if i eat Butterfinger bars.

[1:45:01] <+Fatemaster> There is so much to see in town!
[1:45:04] <+GrateMan> Nugget is basically a CHocobo
[1:45:05] <cap_bon> why not check out the slum? no thanks lady
[1:45:10] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes do you have an industrial fan working nearby?
[1:45:12] <%nerdbayne> looks like Rio

[1:46:02] <+GrateMan> He gets paid in exposure
[1:46:16] <+Fatemaster> Refuse? Orphans? Everything I've ever wanted in a town.
[1:46:22] <@dcn2049> They're too poor to know how to open it
[1:46:27] <%nerdbayne> jacking money from the slums

[1:46:30] <SilverRoddo> Those collaborators. bitterShook
[1:46:32] <gnollAUS> I left this crate of money here. I sure hope no one opens it and takes it
[1:46:36] <%Samex_Comex> Take their toys
[1:46:36] <cap_bon> everyone under the plates is an actor this is basically one big trueman show
[1:46:37] <+Neoripo> *new
[1:46:47] <+fingalights> Like the orphans
[1:47:01] <+GrateMan> He has to sneak out of the house in a minigame first!
[1:47:10] <NiktenKing> Close enough
[1:47:23] <law240> Hall & Oates
[1:47:31] <+ArmoredTeeth> Ah, my favorite character, cornflakes
[1:47:38] <SilverRoddo> Peen?

[1:48:36] <Murphio_GS> They wanna be idols
[1:48:37] <SilverRoddo> Garbage wrestling?

[1:49:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> You know this doesn't seem that awful for a slum
[1:49:05] <+Jumpie8> LUL
[1:49:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It's even worse, they want to star in Rent.
[1:49:10] <Commissar_Cornflakes> I mean no one seems deformed by chemical runoff
[1:49:12] <NiktenKing> LUL
[1:49:16] <Commissar_Cornflakes> No one is shitting in the streets
[1:49:17] <+Fatemaster> My Immortal: The Musical
[1:49:24] <oshkeet41> did that child admit to robbing people
[1:49:25] <Commissar_Cornflakes> No motorcycle robber-murderers
[1:49:27] <%hgtarras> The movie not the play
[1:49:48] <@dcn2049> I hate all these children
[1:49:55] <law240> 40 years
[1:49:59] <law240> maybe
[1:50:00] <%nerdbayne> yes
[1:50:01] <oshkeet41> hahah
[1:50:02] <+ArmoredTeeth> Mako tech speeds progress up
[1:50:02] <+GrateMan> Looks like last gen Hojo
[1:50:03] <%ragerunner2020> yes
[1:50:04] <+TheGurumash> Yea it does
[1:50:05] <+Neoripo> At least it was started
[1:50:06] <+Jumpie8> yeah
[1:50:06] <CursedNobleman> i could buy that
[1:50:07] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Yeah, and now I hate him
[1:50:10] <Sol_Install> a bit
[1:50:14] <arran_throttle> loveless 2: Seth the bitch
[1:50:16] <%nerdbayne> he looks smug enough
[1:50:17] <%hgtarras> 100%
[1:50:34] <Huntercd> Yes in the same way Biggs is just Charle Sheen
[1:50:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Won't ever happen again.
[1:50:45] <SilverRoddo> He does look like the poll smoker.
[1:50:54] <+GrateMan> What? A plate fall? Never gonna happen!
[1:50:56] <+Neoripo> Yes
[1:50:58] <Sol_Install> yep
[1:50:59] <BillieNoMates> probably
[1:51:02] <+ArmoredTeeth> Shit happens
[1:51:08] <MilkingEdge> crushing
[1:51:12] <NiktenKing> 5
[1:51:12] <heroicspiritavenger> @plagueofgripes considering the fact that they canonized the whole FFX-2‚Äôs Shinra coming to settle on the planet, would it surprise you if Midgar was less than 100 years old?
[1:51:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> 5
[1:51:17] <@dcn2049> sector 5
[1:51:18] <law240> constriction accident maybe?
[1:51:19] <BillieNoMates> You are in sector 5
[1:51:22] <cap_bon> how often do plates fall then!? that sounds like a real shitty system then
[1:51:25] <snowmanse> Sector 6 unfinished in the original. They retconned that Avalanche sabotaged construction in Before Crisis
[1:51:38] <Huntercd> That if fucking stupid
[1:51:57] <jiggydoo> Love you Plague
[1:52:04] <%hgtarras> I mean cities being built on top cities is not new
[1:52:06] <+Neoripo> Explanation for the destroyed highway and park. so yeah. There might have been a whole town crushed beneath
[1:52:10] <+GrateMan> So what IS Canon anymore? Obviously not CC, and that means no Before Crisis. Dirge maybe?
[1:52:20] <+GrateMan> Advent Chidlren?
[1:52:25] <RothurThePaladin> Good evening Plague and chat
[1:52:32] <cap_bon> time ghosts are cannon now
[1:52:34] <heroicspiritavenger> X and X-2
[1:52:57] <MilkingEdge> old folks home
[1:52:58] <oshkeet41> funny reference(tm)
[1:53:06] <Murphio_GS> Nice
[1:53:15] <Matrixvingian> Was sector six Genova's impact site?
[1:53:17] <cap_bon> steal their music
[1:53:30] <%hgtarras> I love when you call pats crazy talk dumb
[1:53:39] <%nerdbayne> you got a vial of celery
[1:53:40] <Murphio_GS> It would take a long while
[1:53:44] <Matrixvingian> NICE!
[1:53:52] <law240> Mako Baby
[1:54:01] <heroicspiritavenger> There‚Äôs a dude literally wearing Shinra‚Äôs mask from X-2 in a portrait of the founders of Shinra @plagueofgripes
[1:54:01] <+GrateMan> Midgar is the only plate city in the game isn't it? Like Juno is high tech but not built on top of itself
[1:54:07] <Huntercd> What time period here?
[1:54:14] <CursedNobleman> Enginering wise, its more likely they dig midgar down rather than make illars and build it up
[1:54:18] <LunarRemix> I thought it was old because it's so big and so many people live there
[1:54:20] <Gavaline> Organization XIII is now canon in FF lore
[1:54:24] <MilkingEdge> hobo scaring the kids
[1:54:34] <%nerdbayne> its the future @Huntercd
[1:54:40] <+Fatemaster> Hobo with a shotgun
[1:55:11] <%CyberDingus> Plague NO
[1:55:21] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague YES
[1:55:28] <+ArmoredTeeth> We may have gone too far in a few places
[1:55:33] <Huntercd> So why do the npcs look like they are in different time periods?
[1:55:44] <oshkeet41> I do like how things appropriately look like bootleg CDs instead of genuine ones.
[1:55:49] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Some are reused FF XV models, supposedly
[1:55:52] <heroicspiritavenger> @huntercd Chinese outsourced assets
[1:55:52] <Murphio_GS> lol
[1:55:52] <@dcn2049> hahahaa
[1:55:52] <+ArmoredTeeth> LUL
[1:56:03] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Because the company was too cheap to do their job
[1:56:07] <sosuke5> You can't escape the chad
[1:56:07] <+Neoripo> He's a time ghost i tell you
[1:56:08] <MilkingEdge> Keen eye for the cloud guy
[1:56:20] <$doomp12> chadley has imprinted on you
[1:56:32] <oshkeet41> CHadley's kind of lame even by the standards of FF's 'inexplicably everywhere weird NPCs'
[1:56:33] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> he reproduces via spores, so he has to move to leave as many offspring as possible
[1:56:38] <oshkeet41> like chocolina
[1:56:48] <GeltonZ> Chadley has a cool sidequest for you
[1:56:59] <law240> must have missed he the revive materia in the Jessie mission
[1:57:03] <%nerdbayne> what are your thoughts on the soundtrack?
[1:57:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fuck this guy
[1:57:06] <GarrisonWaifu> I hate everything about this character
[1:57:10] <+Neoripo> Chocolina was much worse
[1:57:14] <LunarRemix> Watch him be a time traveler or something.
[1:57:17] <cap_bon> how has this kid not been mugged
[1:57:17] <%Samex_Comex> Ew kill it for Xp
[1:57:24] <GeltonZ> I prefer Chocolina because she's dumb and has tits.
[1:57:29] <+ArmoredTeeth> Aeiris has a clean browser history
[1:57:33] <+GrateMan> Look at this dudes shirt
[1:57:38] <@dcn2049> oh shit, he's gonna have some larger part
[1:57:39] <GeltonZ> BUT Chadley has a cool quest this time!
[1:57:42] <+GrateMan> A Monacle?!
[1:57:45] <+Neoripo> that with being an elder god and Saz's chocobo chick
[1:58:14] <law240> That's what First strike is
[1:58:18] <+Neoripo> You use it and you get ATB bar
[1:58:24] <Explodincatz> its free ATB at start of battle
[1:58:25] <GeltonZ> @Neoripo YES! Maximize the stupidity
[1:58:26] <+Neoripo> it has a cooldown
[1:58:29] <$doomp12> it's the death of subtly, now characters are tropes and that their arc.
[1:58:41] <+TheGurumash> Single time boost
[1:58:45] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> No
[1:58:51] <arkv01> chadleys going to make you get in his boypants for even more useful materia
[1:59:00] <MilkingEdge> amzing news
[1:59:14] <%nerdbayne> i love the new NPCs....
[1:59:15] <+Neoripo> VR
[1:59:15] <Murphio_GS> Is it weird that I don't think his voice matches the way he looks
[1:59:17] <Gavaline> Why does he keep saying Cloud's name?
[1:59:24] <GarrisonWaifu> I hate his stupid ribbon on his strap, I hate his stupid face marking, i hate his dumb name
[1:59:26] <+ArmoredTeeth> Time for Metal Gear
[1:59:27] <oshkeet41> cause he's awkward and formal
[1:59:27] <%CyberDingus> \le sigh\
[1:59:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I agree Plague
[1:59:33] <+GrateMan> What does he have garters? Did Nomura design this guy?
[1:59:46] <@dcn2049> Chad is some sort of time-spy
[1:59:48] <reiface08> they got smart phones over there at shinra HQ

[2:00:44] <oshkeet41> Wonder if its a way to get materia you missed? Thatd be cool
[2:00:47] <+ArmoredTeeth> I've come up with a nice recipe

[2:06:42] <Murphio_GS> Shinra?
[2:06:43] <TastySammiches> shinra gets up to all kinds of weird shit
[2:06:43] <Albedo28> shinra has many plans
[2:06:44] <Monkeyweed21> Her name is Aerith Plague
[2:06:45] <TalisKanju> Stop foreshadowing an event that happened in a game released over 20 years ago
[2:06:45] <$doomp12> @hgtarras aerith
[2:06:50] <+Neoripo> Shinra. -Barret-
[2:06:50] <arkv01> I mean the real answer is 90s JRPG bestiary variety
[2:06:52] <$vampireinarm> some materia dont proc if youre controling the character
[2:06:54] <MilkingEdge> smug monster
[2:06:58] <ammobasket> Mako pollution is weird
[2:07:07] <dmdyne99> Why doesn't Cloud, the biggest hedgehog, simply eat the smaller hedgehog pies?
[2:07:11] <+muzzle_roar24> Time ghost don't stop enemies from ganging up on Aerith rooCult
[2:07:13] <Restainly> the smog monster killing the planet
[2:07:33] <+Neoripo> yeah
[2:07:36] <+thegreenbenis> Her spells and abilities super fucking dunk on the enemies
[2:07:40] <Albedo28> poopy
[2:07:46] <Murphio_GS> Very dirty
[2:07:49] <TastySammiches> ü•ß vineSanic
[2:07:51] <reiface08> delicious
[2:07:54] <MilkingEdge> cream pies
[2:07:54] <Albedo28> cow pie
[2:07:57] <$vampireinarm> Kappa
[2:07:58] <oshkeet41> moist
[2:08:00] <TalisKanju> Moist hedgehog pie cream
[2:08:06] <ammobasket> 3.14 times as dangerous as a normal hedghog
[2:08:13] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes ladies enjoy it plague. Porn showed it many times.
[2:08:15] <Restainly> I thought hedgehog pie was on the menu every week for ur farmer ass
[2:08:18] <%Gogogolem> Creampies are how Abercrombie children happen.
[2:08:20] <+HawkGoggles2> I think a creampie is always good if someone wants it.
[2:08:23] <GarrisonWaifu> bitterGasm
[2:08:24] <+Neoripo> He got yeeted far
[2:08:26] <sadboy_otoroshi> I say delici.... (flashing memories of dark souls) OH!
[2:08:27] <bigboy3d> All people come from cream pies
[2:08:31] <reinbachthe3rd> Kreygasm
[2:08:32] <TalisKanju> Moist hedgehog cream pie
[2:08:39] <Murphio_GS> Oh I already know what you're talking about
[2:08:44] <%Samex_Comex> It's just food
[2:08:47] <+Neoripo> LEWD
[2:08:48] <+Jumpie8> brownJOKES
[2:08:51] <ahaegotrigger> True
[2:09:08] <Albedo28> dead robos
[2:09:09] <+0ni0n_L0rd> That sounds nice
[2:09:11] <Restainly> who did u creampie? Woolie?
[2:09:13] <+Jumpie8> that sounds delicious
[2:09:18] <+peri_d0t> "aww that corpse is adorable!"
[2:09:18] <+Neoripo> Are they dead?
[2:09:37] <arkv01> so is this the chapter cloud finally awakes to his hunger for child flesh?
[2:09:50] <Albedo28> plague lives up to my imagination, enjoying the view of corpses
[2:09:51] <+Jumpie8> Woolie would just steal the pie
[2:09:54] <Albedo28> its on the groun
[2:09:56] <+thegreenbenis> Her heal spell is crazy effective.
[2:09:57] <ScreamLord> Yes
[2:10:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> Are those gremilins with head-pipes?
[2:10:01] <+Neoripo> I think ground
[2:10:04] <Albedo28> double spells for days
[2:10:21] <Restainly> Plague use to make pies but woolie stole them all lol
[2:10:31] <MilkingEdge> eat shit aeris
[2:10:33] <arkv01> she's a wee babby gurl who can't dodge a big long katana
[2:10:45] <TastySammiches> does the music get all fucked up when you're getting your ass kicked?
[2:10:56] <Murphio_GS> Forty cakes
[2:10:57] <tolloponik> whats with the music it keeps warping
[2:11:00] <arkv01> no, its just a twitch buffering thing
[2:11:06] <TastySammiches> or is twitch just being weird
[2:11:08] <Albedo28> clood can use the magic circle she drops
[2:11:18] <Matrixvingian> Power level Aerith until she can samurai grab the one winged angel's blade.
[2:11:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> in game Low health warning.
[2:11:31] <+tymetak> shes stuck in the fart gas
[2:11:36] <arkv01> goddamit not the red health aura shit again
[2:11:41] <TastySammiches> "I can't do anything" says the man with 78 potions
[2:11:41] <MilkingEdge> get rekt aeris
[2:11:53] <+thegreenbenis> Have you been upgrading her equipment?
[2:12:09] <+lordericter> mmm here to watch all those Nomura ghosts
[2:12:19] <arkv01> you TRIED but you were born to die literaly
[2:12:25] <+ArmoredTeeth> She's a fighter
[2:12:40] <+EpicureanIguana> it's her destiny, might as well embrace it
[2:12:49] <+peri_d0t> she seems not very effective?
[2:12:50] <arkv01> just let her die :(
[2:12:56] <jbrachob> spoiler!
[2:13:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:13:05] <LunarRemix> She probably would do better in a full party.
[2:13:08] <MilkingEdge> hahahaha
[2:13:15] <Albedo28> she's good against the slow big enemies, I bet
[2:13:16] <arkv01> wow these pies wrecked us huh
[2:13:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> For moments i think that the battle system is not that fully realised. Aggro ability would be useful right now.
[2:13:28] <Vaiire> It's almost as if the battle system isn't made for micro-management.
[2:13:28] <+peri_d0t> maybe you're underleveled? idk im new
[2:13:31] <MilkingEdge> aeris got CREAMPIED
[2:13:39] <+tymetak> back in the day you could put her in the back row with the rest of the squishies
[2:13:50] <+aspirationdeath> shes super effective. just gotta kit her right
[2:13:55] <oshkeet41> aggro is the provoke i guess, but its goofy enemies seem to home in on whoever is being controlled whether theyre doing damage or not
[2:14:09] <Albedo28> her infini-magic basic attacks hit pretty hard
[2:14:46] <NiktenKing> There you go
[2:14:47] <suitangi021> Is it a way to hide the fact that the ai doesn't do much on their own?
[2:15:14] <arkv01> cmon heal thot, pull your weight
[2:15:28] <LunarRemix> It's more like they made the AI not do much otherwise the game would be either too easy or too hard.
[2:15:40] <Albedo28> no longer cute!
[2:15:57] <law240> Shiva would be real helpful here
[2:15:57] <+Bane_Kaikyo> Any reason you choose not to stand in the healing feild?
[2:15:58] <MilkingEdge> she's cummin
[2:16:05] <+thegreenbenis> @PlagueOfGripes A tip for using Aerith is to switch to her long enough to only use a spell then switch back to Cloud, Because they aggro the fuck out of her.
[2:16:05] <+peri_d0t> yeah seems like anattempt to avoid making competent ai partners cause thats hard
[2:16:37] <LunarRemix> Not saying that's hard, but if you make the AI too strong, then the game becomes too easy
[2:16:39] <arkv01> magical girl aeris beam!
[2:16:52] <TastySammiches> WutFace
[2:16:54] <LunarRemix> But if you make the game harder for it, it might be too hard because you'd have to kit your whole party
[2:16:55] <+peri_d0t> it is hard tho from what i've heard.
[2:17:06] <+peri_d0t> might be wrong tho
[2:17:13] <+peri_d0t> not a game dev
[2:17:19] <LunarRemix> They could just jack up the attack frequency though.
[2:17:57] <suitangi021> yeah but the game focuses on stagger but also wants to emphasize the action aspect of the game.
[2:17:58] <%Samex_Comex> Choo choo!
[2:18:08] <+RittiFruity> insight gained
[2:18:12] <suitangi021> problem with that is ai doesn't use atb
[2:18:15] <arkv01> combat is fine with everyone except aeris tbh
[2:18:15] <Albedo28> choco-chick scares me
[2:18:34] <+serranobros> I WONDER WHY
[2:18:41] <+peri_d0t> so i guess fuck long ranged characters?
[2:18:49] <HyperBomb21> Aerith gets more fun to play when you get more materia
[2:18:52] <+peri_d0t> was barret fine?
[2:18:53] <arkv01> do we have regen
[2:19:08] <sadboy_otoroshi> Call shit on this but ¬øWould this game be ok with multiplayer? the thing is that the story doesn't allow it.
[2:19:09] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Sorry, but did you equip provoke on Cloud?
[2:19:15] <+Bane_Kaikyo> You were also ignoring the healing feild she put down
[2:19:18] <suitangi021> @peri_d0t not really Barret seems fine
[2:19:26] <HyperBomb21> @PlagueOfGripes did you find the provoke materia?
[2:19:34] <HyperBomb21> once you do, put it on cloud, it makers her much easier
[2:19:41] <NiktenKing> Not really... you are supposed to put down your buff, then doublecast your spells. She makes the most out of ATB
[2:19:49] <+ArmoredTeeth> To be fair, she doesn't lift as much as Tifa does.
[2:19:51] <Albedo28> not a healing field, it doubles attack magic cast in there
[2:20:01] <+Bane_Kaikyo> ah ok, nvm then
[2:20:07] <HyperBomb21> big same
[2:20:14] <arkv01> aeris definitely won't be stomping my balls like tifa
[2:20:20] <HyperBomb21> This game doesnt have enough materia slots; at least at this point in the game
[2:20:25] <%nerdbayne> so assess is Scan materia?
[2:20:31] <HyperBomb21> ye
[2:20:33] <Albedo28> yerp
[2:20:40] <arkv01> it was like this in the original too, there was just less materia variety in at this point in OG
[2:20:58] <vincerocmm> replay abiliuty??
[2:21:00] <+BigCoffee> Better more then too few I guess, but it is overwhelming
[2:21:02] <arkv01> oh these horrible children
[2:21:13] <+peri_d0t> i might have just played bad but in the original i was running out of materia
[2:21:20] <Albedo28> ah, more strangely well dressed street urchins
[2:21:26] <+ArmoredTeeth> LUL
[2:21:28] <+BigCoffee> So how come cloud can jump 3 stories with 2 kids in his arms, but he can't jump around the church earlier
[2:21:32] <Johnmaddened> good ref

[2:21:49] <MilkingEdge> dat waz kool
[2:21:51] <sadboy_otoroshi> The power of cutscenes is boundless
[2:21:59] <Commissar_Cornflakes> Cloud isn't use to unironic positive reinforcement
[2:22:07] <%nerdbayne> cloud has some nice looking hammer pants
[2:22:11] <MilkingEdge> underskirt darkness
[2:22:11] <%JailShmixRemix> the infinite void

[2:22:20] <%Samex_Comex> Voids are hot
[2:22:26] <arkv01> her pelvis is likely modelled but no coochie :)
[2:22:29] <T_Sasquatch> Vaginas are a dark abyss
[2:22:35] <HyperBomb21> oh yeah, this is when more interesting enemies actually show up
[2:22:43] <HyperBomb21> These guys in particular can mess you up
[2:23:07] <Albedo28> double cast happens close to each other
[2:23:11] <+tymetak> she just did a mr freeze oneliner
[2:23:17] <%JailShmixRemix> Spoilers!
[2:23:18] <Albedo28> helps when interrupts happen so often
[2:23:19] <sadboy_otoroshi> Her crotch and pelvis are like a "N" in a minimalistic font.
[2:23:33] <HyperBomb21> I wish i was cool ;_;
[2:24:16] <Albedo28> hopes and prayers
[2:24:23] <MilkingEdge> I used to be a solider, did i tell you i was a solider maybe you didn't hear i was a solider

[2:25:04] <+peri_d0t> i dont mind kids. these ones are...not great

[2:31:23] <oshkeet41> thats why there's so many kids
[2:31:35] <terminusterminal> Oh no is Mog a Groomer?
[2:31:42] <Matrixvingian> Moogle's are community druglords [x]
[2:31:42] <vincerocmm> dont think about it (telling that to the wrong guy here)
[2:31:43] <arkv01> wait what, is that ff9 moogle sex lore?
[2:31:43] <gnollAUS> HELLO, I AM SOME PEOPLE

[2:32:13] <+Neoripo> For the skill
[2:32:13] <sadboy_otoroshi> hi dad i'm about to kill you
[2:33:06] <MilkingEdge> time to raid the corpses
[2:33:16] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:33:25] <suitangi021> The Gun paladin of the planet Barret
[2:33:32] <+Neoripo> You can grind medals via a minigame there
[2:33:49] <MilkingEdge> kupo
[2:33:57] <arkv01> you got a weird tic kid, no wonder the other kids beat on you
[2:34:07] <cursedcharley> What a jackass
[2:34:19] <%CyberDingus> Cloud flexes in front of a kid.
[2:34:22] <terminusterminal> Just make it a real Moogle. This looks really creepy.
[2:34:38] <arkv01> children must be harvested for their souls
[2:34:49] <themightyseptopus> being trapped ina Chuck E Cheese
[2:34:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> This kid will be the leader of a entertainment multi-conglomerate in the future.
[2:34:52] <oshkeet41> i mean a dude in a full shitty moogle costume would be funny
[2:34:54] <gnollAUS> Your suffering sustains us Plague
[2:34:54] <Matrixvingian> Cloud isn't even edgy at this point.
[2:34:57] <agadejobi> What's that fancy word that Plague just used?
[2:35:03] <Matrixvingian> I'm on pretty boy's side in this.
[2:35:07] <arkv01> ohhh ahriman?
[2:35:08] <LunarRemix> Again with the month flapping
[2:35:10] <%caramello_man> anathema
[2:35:14] <+comfyman12> is this gay Ken
[2:35:29] <Sartastic> what mouth flapping, what do you mean
[2:35:36] <cursedcharley> I'd rather not
[2:35:39] <arkv01> they'd have to love children, platonically
[2:35:39] <+peri_d0t> i would rather dir
[2:35:41] <+Neoripo> You mean hell?
[2:35:42] <Sartastic> they look perfectly normal
[2:35:46] <+caffienatedjedi> work at Chuck E Cheese and when you go home at night you get jumped by hell house
[2:35:53] <Murphio_GS> That guy walked like a fucking queen
[2:35:55] <Murphio_GS> love it
[2:35:58] <+Neoripo> You are free now
[2:36:06] <$doomp12> I have, and nihilism has been my best friend ever since
[2:36:07] <oshkeet41> I hate when tthey say Wall Market too fast, it sounds like WalMart
[2:36:15] <+peri_d0t> no more kids plague, how ya feel?
[2:36:15] <arkv01> yeah I hear walmart too
[2:36:30] <sadboy_otoroshi> szzzom
[2:36:56] <arkv01> time for big sidequest
[2:37:00] <+peri_d0t> i hear walmart every time and it throws me off so hard
[2:37:13] <+ATorL> I mean
[2:37:13] <mr_slaide> Yes, but Chadler is SPPPEECCCIIIAAALLL!
[2:37:15] <+ATorL> VR is expensive
[2:37:18] <arkv01> I mean we have vr goggles, most of us still prefer screens
[2:37:20] <+ATorL> CDs are cheap
[2:37:20] <+ArmoredTeeth> Chadley's dad works at Nintendo
[2:37:22] <NiktenKing> Well... they are poor
[2:37:22] <Albedo28> Hope you enjoy your night, Plague. My drugs are saying its bed time.
[2:37:23] <Sartastic> I mean how can you listen to N-Sync
[2:37:25] <+peri_d0t> this is the slums so
[2:37:27] <TheHeroAppears> mmm slum balls
[2:37:31] <+RittiFruity> mmmmm meat balls
[2:37:49] <oshkeet41> Yuffie's honestly the only charcter id grudgingly say got better in the extended nonsense, even some of the music is remixed nice
[2:37:58] <Matrixvingian> Not everyone wants reality devouring goggles?
[2:38:04] <arkv01> king kitty
[2:38:11] <Matrixvingian> These are people that believe in invisible luck fluff pigs.
[2:38:13] <Djinnazz> Doubt it.
[2:38:13] <+Neoripo> You are at the station, you where here a while ago
[2:38:21] <arkv01> honeybee cameo would be cool
[2:38:33] <arkv01> maybe he pops in while cloud is being railed by a train of buff men
[2:38:47] <+YaBoiShamoi> is yuffie in this game I haven't seen anything about her yet?
[2:38:48] <LunarRemix> His pilot was in one of the trailers so it's possible he's in game
[2:38:50] <arkv01> and he's like GAWRSH, WRONG ROOM HAHA
[2:38:59] <+Neoripo> You can go to the church
[2:39:11] <+peri_d0t> i think id e cool if yuffie was in but you couldn't recruit her ye
[2:39:14] <+peri_d0t> yet*
[2:40:03] <+aspirationdeath> @arkv01 somehow they made that sequence even gayer than getting gangraped by musclemen
[2:40:16] <arkv01> can't wait PogChamp
[2:40:16] <%hgtarras> These side quest in areas reminds me of wither 2
[2:40:32] <NiktenKing> They reference that Avalanche promised materia for Wutai if they helped... that's basically it
[2:40:33] <arkv01> sweet, time to get snacks and drinks
[2:40:33] <SoFarFetched> That's a drawing LUL
[2:40:34] <%hgtarras> Hi everyone
[2:41:14] <+peri_d0t> these arent plages right?
[2:41:22] <+Punishedkaiger> They are not
[2:41:25] <sadboy_otoroshi> Fan art
[2:41:31] <Murphio_GS> Megaplague
[2:41:33] <%nerdbayne> this track is called "under the rotting pizza"
[2:41:35] <+peri_d0t> oh i didn't know he did this
[2:41:41] <+peri_d0t> its nice
[2:41:52] <badfaithmaxter> The classic
[2:42:42] <%CyberDingus> That was unholy.
[2:43:05] <mr_slaide> Children are assholes.
[2:43:12] <%CyberDingus> Plague chat for 10 minutes please.
[2:43:14] <TheWe4pon> nah fuck kids
[2:43:24] <Sartastic> not like, just nice
[2:43:24] <+peri_d0t> it honestly depends on the kid
[2:43:41] <Gavaline> Most people, including kids, are awful
[2:43:45] <+Jumpie8> people are just awful
[2:43:46] <ahaegotrigger> kids are too dumb to trust but they can be really adorable
[2:43:57] <%JJCheeker> my nieces and nephews are pretty chill
[2:44:21] <tokenreefer> good kids are pretty cool.
[2:44:34] <LunarRemix> Yeah it depends on their parents.
[2:44:38] <+peri_d0t> ^
[2:44:52] <tokenreefer> shitty parents shitty kids
[2:44:56] <+peri_d0t> well, nature vs nurture is a thing
[2:45:07] <%JJCheeker> Yeah
[2:45:16] <+peri_d0t> ive had great kids with shitty parent
[2:45:50] <+Jumpie8> Chicken Little looking fuck
[2:45:57] <IntrepidEye> I think the only thing worse than shit kids is shit parents who stand by with their face in their phones while their kids are running around being little shits.
[2:46:14] <sadolerlaqreet1> The power of summoning chicken boys is a dark art
[2:46:28] <StromkoPenguin> I didn't realize a non-human thing could evoke the uncanny valley reaction. What a hideous bird mutant.
[2:46:36] <sadboy_otoroshi> Since we don't have a right way to rise children anymore, thanks postmodernism we never got the pieces together again.
[2:46:41] <tokenreefer> depends on what kind of shitty parent you are
[2:47:14] <%JJCheeker> I think it would be funny if it kept saying "kill me"'
[2:47:17] <+peri_d0t> i dont think the "right way" to raise kids exists
[2:47:27] <+peri_d0t> its a job that requires adaptability
[2:47:47] <tokenreefer> i mean there is a spectrum and a line you can cross
[2:47:54] <+cvp5127> use wind
[2:48:08] <tolloponik> @PlagueOfGripes I think you under-leveled cause pat was at 20 when he got here
[2:48:22] <TheWe4pon> are they casting barrier?
[2:48:22] <ECHLORD> do you think sephiroth will be playable in the next game?
[2:48:28] <ahaegotrigger> Perfect
[2:48:57] <tokenreefer> git gud
[2:49:18] <sadboy_otoroshi> @PlagueOfGripes You're UNDERLEVELED
[2:49:19] <ahaegotrigger> so why is this thing so immune?
[2:49:27] <mr_slaide> Ohhh... Are those assholes the type of monsters who are either immune to magic OR physical but not at the same time?
[2:49:37] <Djinnazz> they switch between magic/physical immune
[2:49:40] <tokenreefer> @aspirationdeath fair enough
[2:49:45] <%nerdbayne> wow, even the fights are drawn out
[2:49:48] <Trinity5> how's plague feeling about the game so far
[2:49:54] <mr_slaide> Makes sense.
[2:49:59] <ahaegotrigger> that sounds so annoying
[2:50:05] <NiktenKing> It's casting shell and barrier apparently
[2:50:17] <+peri_d0t> it seems like you might be underleveled. but i might not know the mechanics
[2:50:44] <arkv01> I dunno I've checked some other streamers out and they're around this level
[2:51:23] <BrachyZoid> But are you having fun talking too much?
[2:51:24] <mr_slaide> We still love you Plague.
[2:51:33] <sadboy_otoroshi> @aspirationdeath You use this instead :^)
[2:52:21] <sjcodan> Whats good, eggman?
[2:52:41] <mr_slaide> They remind me a little of those dumb forg creatures in Chrono Trigger.
[2:52:49] <mr_slaide> frog creatures even...
[2:53:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> They are designs from the same era...
[2:53:27] <sadboy_otoroshi> And Japan has a thing for Frogs
[2:53:38] <dashwalrus> maybe hard mode changes enemy placement and respawn rate
[2:53:42] <mr_slaide> There ya go.
[2:54:02] <mr_slaide> Weak to aero.
[2:54:05] <Djinnazz> yeah
[2:54:08] <mr_slaide> Like most floating enemies.
[2:54:15] <MilkingEdge> huffin that mako
[2:54:47] <mr_slaide> Yop
[2:54:50] <Djinnazz> yeah
[2:54:51] <%JailShmixRemix> Yes
[2:54:52] <NiktenKing> Yes
[2:54:54] <TheWe4pon> yes
[2:55:05] <Djinnazz> She has no melee attacks in this one.
[2:55:11] <arkv01> I mean she didn't display any magical girl qualities in the original
[2:55:28] <LunarRemix> Apparently you have to hit them with more than just a single magic.
[2:55:32] <mr_slaide> Yeah, the barrier spell.
[2:55:55] <sadboy_otoroshi> What other type of attack there is in the game besides magic and physical?
[2:56:45] <gnollAUS> The glowy bits floating around means magic shield. The otigon plates means physical resist
[2:56:55] <+StreamStopA> Hi all. Did i miss the Tifa sex part yet?
[2:57:05] <sadboy_otoroshi> wut
[2:57:07] <NiktenKing> They are probably easier with multiple members spamming spells and beatdowns
[2:58:29] <tokenreefer> yes sex is easier with spells and beatdowns
[2:58:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> Nah, we would just gobble a farming stream anyways, since the story bits are so far apart.
[2:58:55] <corpsegoo> refocus is trade your limit break for having three atb bars instead of two
[2:58:59] <+th3madness> the sex part is in the pornhub dlc
[2:59:01] <mr_slaide> ^
[2:59:13] <+aspirationdeath> what would a farming stream even be?
[2:59:14] <mr_slaide> What corpsegoo said: it allows you to have 3 ATB bars.
[2:59:19] <Trinity5> "shinra bitches" LUL
[2:59:33] <+caffienatedjedi> Is Aerith just your pimp now?
[2:59:40] <tokenreefer> spam gravirgra
[2:59:48] <tokenreefer> magic missle
[2:59:50] <corpsegoo> (I farmed out two refocus uses and then never equipped it again)
[2:59:53] <%JailShmixRemix> Someone is always cloud's pimp
[2:59:59] <LunarRemix> God I hope so @caffienatedjedi
[3:00:23] <mr_slaide> No.
[3:00:34] <saddlezilla1> says that he doesn't remember each 1st class unless their Sephy
[3:00:57] <+aspirationdeath> the way mobs repop in this game somehow feels more tedious than random battles. feels like mmo grinding
[3:01:13] <saddlezilla1> unconscious sympathy for other grunts too maybe
[3:01:34] <%nerdbayne> remember, cloud right now is not really cloud, but cloud with Zach's memories
[3:01:34] <tokenreefer> well they probably use the same engine
[3:01:42] <%JJCheeker> Is that Charles Bronson
[3:01:44] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, some monsters turned my wife's grave into their home
[3:01:46] <%nerdbayne> you helping out charles bronson?
[3:01:48] <sadboy_otoroshi> That man is a retired porn actor.
[3:02:23] <LunarRemix> Nah porn actors never retire.
[3:03:14] <saddlezilla1> I'm happy thinking of all the dumb videos ppl will make when they get the models
[3:03:23] <GeltonZ> ZERGS!!!
[3:03:24] <themightyseptopus> look at these mmo mobs
[3:03:32] <ohyouwouldntbelieveme> Eternal rest after all...
[3:04:01] <saddlezilla1> pat nearly ate shit at these guys
[3:04:29] <sadboy_otoroshi> Assess the hydralisks
[3:04:32] <BrachyZoid> Gotta get huge
[3:05:08] <arkv01> the voice lines in this game are begging to be ripped for SFM use
[3:05:28] <+aspirationdeath> @arkv01 when this comes to pc its over
[3:05:32] <+caffienatedjedi> It will be a new age of SFM thanks to this game.
[3:06:03] <+Crimznking> look, hyrdralisks
[3:06:07] <LunarRemix> You can rip models off a PS4 games if you really want to.
[3:06:12] <cap_bon> status effect enemies are fun and engaging
[3:06:18] <arkv01> why aren't we summoning ifrit for big deeps?
[3:06:22] <saddlezilla1> @caffienatedjedi I hope to god something as great as the "Redfield Family Line" comes from this
[3:06:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> ¬øHow do you make a voice actress do fake pain noises that don't sound sexual? Trick question, you can¬¥t!
[3:07:08] <+tymetak> reminds me of vanille in FF13
[3:07:18] <Matrixvingian> So we're Starcraft now? Final Fantasy 40k Tyranids?
[3:07:20] <Djinnazz> This Big bois are only for boss fight types.
[3:07:30] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> summons only come out for bosses, I guess. special bosses.
[3:07:54] <+aspirationdeath> @engwithan_elder_god he just summoned the chicken...
[3:07:59] <+caffienatedjedi> Man, limiting the big summons to the big bosses is no fun. Gotta bring Knights of the Round down on basic Shinra soldiers.
[3:08:01] <sadboy_otoroshi> None of the Tyranids sliders.
[3:08:12] <arkv01> these designs are 40ks as hell for sure, that and the mech bosses lead me to believe squenix is working on a 40k game :)
[3:09:03] <Trinity5> looks pretty fuckin' doink
[3:09:11] <Shadowr54> Slooooooooow mmooooooooooo
[3:09:14] <medril07> uuuuhhhhhhh....
[3:09:17] <Ynkubus18> Sorta but a lot of mech design is influenced by kow yokoyama
[3:09:33] <medril07> runs right into the nest
[3:09:36] <conchubar11> but i wanna
[3:09:36] <Ynkubus18> and other japanese artist/hobbyists
[3:09:42] <Trinity5> thank god there's an auto return button
[3:09:42] <+caffienatedjedi> Now to get paid 10 gil and a basic potion
[3:09:44] <SuperVaderMan> This graveyard sucks
[3:10:04] <medril07> triple triad cards?
[3:10:05] <Shadowr54> "Yep, Grave's still there."
[3:10:06] <Matrixvingian> Lifestream VATS
[3:10:20] <%CyberDingus> Gay Ken?
[3:10:34] <saddlezilla1> eyeball quest dude
[3:10:41] <arran_throttle> he is his new boyfriend
[3:11:00] <sadboy_otoroshi> @Ynkubus18 THanks for the name, now i can have another inspiration besides Otomo and Terada
[3:11:07] <themightyseptopus> Old Man got lumbago
[3:11:10] <+tymetak> that guy looks like hes 40 years old
[3:11:21] <LunarRemix> Yeah he doesn't look old
[3:11:31] <Trinity5> i was confused at the end of this too lol
[3:11:35] <+StreamStopA> You want money for doing work, what a dick.
[3:11:41] <arkv01> cloud is really ripping into the impoverished
[3:11:42] <+aspirationdeath> this is a very stupid and confusing moment
[3:11:43] <Trinity5> like, is cloud not gonna give the key back so the old man goes himself?
[3:11:51] <+caffienatedjedi> Hero of fuck you pay me
[3:11:59] <raminnoodle420> It feels good to help people! Eh
[3:12:05] <+tymetak> foreshadowing LUL
[3:12:14] <Matrixvingian> PAYING respects
[3:12:19] <thecat66666> cloud tried to extort the old man
[3:12:21] <saddlezilla1> i think Cloud's trying to be "nice" by saying he can now go to the ggraveyard whenever he wants. But Cloud's too *cool* to be nice?
[3:12:56] <Matrixvingian> The audio of the folks talking out of earshot is making me look over my shoulder.
[3:12:59] <Matrixvingian> YES it's not just me.

[3:13:03] <+caffienatedjedi> Its not like I want to help you or anything... baka!
[3:13:05] <sadboy_otoroshi> "Throwaway Storytelling"
[3:13:21] <Trinity5> i thought the old man told you to give the key back to the moogle kid
[3:13:22] <arkv01> "thats right cloud, eat the poor"
[3:13:24] <Matrixvingian> So the worst thing about this junkyard ghetto is noise pollution?
[3:13:27] <Trinity5> and cloud said he'd only do it for 5k?
[3:13:37] <Trinity5> i haven't been paying attention tho
[3:13:38] <Murphio_GS> It kind've is
[3:13:43] <gnollAUS> Need to keep the dumb dumbs occupied with flashy lights endlessly.
[3:13:46] <LunarRemix> Sometimes yeah. But you learn to turn the noise off.
[3:13:48] <Murphio_GS> Depends what city and where
[3:13:51] <Mrhuggles> would 5,000 $ be in yen format? is that just $50?
[3:13:55] <gnollAUS> Yes
[3:14:03] <sadboy_otoroshi> That place looks nice actually.
[3:14:08] <themightyseptopus> Eh this woman's mouth animation
[3:14:11] <saddlezilla1> do you want another close up on bad flower textures?
[3:14:14] <MilkingEdge> Flower trophy
[3:14:22] <Matrixvingian> Yeah but you can ignore it just be being a human in that situation.
[3:14:26] <gnollAUS> Yes
[3:14:26] <Matrixvingian> Dat Homemother.
[3:14:28] <arran_throttle> so... cloud did some terrorism work for 20$?
[3:14:41] <LunarRemix> Background and sidequests NPC's mouths are really badly animated
[3:14:50] <arkv01> cloud would do blow up reactors for a snickers bar
[3:15:06] <LunarRemix> Whatever program they used to do the lip synch isn't working right
[3:15:10] <+cinder_chan> oh it's a face cam
[3:15:21] <dmdyne99> CHILD LABOR LOOPHOLES
[3:15:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> She has a date and the fucking kids are cock blocking her.
[3:15:24] <ahaegotrigger> what the fuck am I looking at
[3:15:25] <MilkingEdge> child soliders
[3:15:26] <law240> like community service
[3:15:31] <arran_throttle> sounds like what would Pokets the jedi would've done
[3:15:33] <%JailShmixRemix> @PlagueOfGripes I looked it over again: Cloud told the old man to give the key back to moogie and Cloud said he would give it back for 5000gil
[3:15:34] <Matrixvingian> Folia as in foliage as in her hair looks like a fern?
[3:15:41] <arkv01> mama has to get LAID tonight you gremlins
[3:15:43] <+tymetak> its the majoras mask bomber notebook quest
[3:15:43] <sadboy_otoroshi> Isn't Lip synced for japanese.
[3:15:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Go fetch the kids War Hero
[3:16:01] <%JailShmixRemix> Yeah
[3:16:06] <%JailShmixRemix> It doesn't
[3:16:10] <Trinity5> thus... forcing the old man to get off his ass to go give the key back?
[3:16:13] <Trinity5> it really doesn't make sense lol
[3:16:15] <+Jumpie8> this is becoming hell
[3:16:16] <Matrixvingian> This is Plague's favorite content!
[3:16:36] <arkv01> ms harriet potter
[3:16:39] <Matrixvingian> Move aside amazon animal maidens, it's paternal offspring retrieval for certain!
[3:16:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Look at this pointless filler
[3:16:45] <TheWe4pon> I think he was telling the old man to get off his pained ass and do shit
[3:16:49] <cap_bon> across the street? but theres no cars this is a shanty town
[3:16:52] <Trinity5> this kid is a mark
[3:16:56] <Gavaline> This child isn't terrible compared to the rest
[3:17:00] <arkv01> at least she's apologetic
[3:17:03] <Trinity5> LUL
[3:17:11] <LunarRemix> COOLEST KID
[3:17:14] <Trinity5> what kinda kid wears sunglasses like this
[3:17:15] <Gavaline> M-master Miller!?!
[3:17:16] <+caffienatedjedi> Is that kid blind? He has toe blind people glasses
[3:17:16] <Trinity5> oh my lord
[3:17:18] <+aspirationdeath> its such a bad moment. i think its meant to imply that cloud is slyly trying go get the old man to involve himself with the community but he comes off as a massive asshole who picks on old people
[3:17:21] <gnollAUS> Yikes
[3:17:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> look who cool he is though
[3:17:25] <MilkingEdge> kool kid
[3:17:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Do Japanese children talk like this or do Japanese men wish kids talked like this?
[3:17:28] <dmdyne99> That kid looks like a tiny adult
[3:17:34] <arran_throttle> in a sexual way!
[3:17:35] <arkv01> this is prime SFM material
[3:17:35] <Trinity5> geez kid, is it bright on planet cool?
[3:17:41] <arkv01> cloud beats shit kids with a chain
[3:17:45] <Murphio_GS> I don't think Plague would be a good parent
[3:17:56] <FauxGateau> Plague might be the best mentor tho
[3:18:04] <sadboy_otoroshi> How, when did cloud became famous amongst children?
[3:18:06] <Gavaline> That kid looks like someone who is going to fistfight his brother on top of a big robot while pretending to understand genetics
[3:18:07] <suitangi021> Do you like filler?
[3:18:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> That kid's hair tilts me
[3:18:25] <FauxGateau> Jeez earth's voice is a little cringe ngl
[3:18:35] <+D00msDayDan> you would crush your child's dreams in a heartbeat
[3:18:36] <CaptainFrankincense> it does
[3:18:40] <arkv01> it depends on how much you love the mother of your child
[3:18:46] <gnollAUS> That is fine
[3:18:49] <+caffienatedjedi> Gotta get those chemicals in your head
[3:18:50] <sadboy_otoroshi> that soccer player hair...
[3:18:56] <arkv01> if you don't want to pay that child support, you're not gonna love that kid
[3:18:57] <gnollAUS> Your own kids matter. screw other peoples kids
[3:18:58] <FauxGateau> If you could crush your child's dreams that easily then they were weak
[3:19:01] <Trinity5> LUL
[3:19:02] <HyperBomb21> Because kids are knowledges sponges. you can help them be better people
[3:19:04] <+Jumpie8> yeah same
[3:19:07] <Trinity5> yeah same
[3:19:11] <Johnmaddened> same LUL
[3:19:13] <arran_throttle> well, if you don't like other cats, you would like your own cat... kids just like cats, right?
[3:19:26] <medril07> was that kid a moogle
[3:19:29] <Trinity5> cats don't talk they just screm
[3:19:35] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Poser
[3:19:39] <luckycloud91> wtf
[3:19:42] <FauxGateau> THEY all use the buster sword its the symbol of soldier
[3:19:45] <+caffienatedjedi> This one weird trick to get out of school by taking your sword off
[3:19:45] <+VashSyndicate> they would certainly be a very analytical child
[3:19:57] <cap_bon> It wasnt until I was an adult did I realized what a shit child I was and how much shit I ruined for my folks :(
[3:20:01] <Trinity5> plague's child would grow up to slay Pat
[3:20:11] <FauxGateau> Pat would be a dragon at that point
[3:20:18] <FauxGateau> pretty dire mission
[3:20:20] <Trinity5> or a toilet
[3:20:22] <suitangi021> I would imagine you would be a better caretaker than a parent. Especially given stuff you speak about in your videos and scary lessons.
[3:20:25] <tokenreefer> you like that cartoon. let me tell you why it sucks"
[3:20:47] <+caffienatedjedi> I wouldn't dare slay Pat, he might be like Lucius the Eternal and you just turn into him.
[3:20:50] <MilkingEdge> YAWWNNN
[3:20:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Frat douche attire kid
[3:21:06] <LunarRemix> Man I wonder what the time ghosts are up to right now
[3:21:07] <arkv01> yes, her lessons in being a simp! gotta learn!
[3:21:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I think this boy deserves a name at this point
[3:21:14] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Like really
[3:21:24] <+Punishedkaiger> Plague no, bad
[3:21:28] <+FunkyRot> god these kids looks super gross
[3:21:30] <FauxGateau> This kids faces are freaking me out a tad
[3:21:31] <arkv01> ???? deep v neck construction laborers?
[3:21:32] <+TaterBurglar> Look sometimes you gotta take a trip to the Red Light District for reasons other than everyone else there's no shame in earning a living
[3:21:32] <law240> wait for part 2 kid
[3:21:35] <tokenreefer> children that will die dont deserve names
[3:21:42] <+Jumpie8> Plague Pls
[3:21:45] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> stay home loser
[3:21:51] <+BigCoffee> whats wrong with your moooouuuuth
[3:21:57] <FauxGateau> mako poisoning
[3:22:01] <arkv01> jk lawl
[3:22:08] <+Jumpie8> Cloud is a MOOD
[3:22:15] <LunarRemix> It'd make sense that a poor area wouldn't care about terrorists attacking fancy people's place.
[3:22:16] <arkv01> now mama folia can lay down some cooch
[3:22:16] <arran_throttle> There always must be the angriest ginger dwarf
[3:22:22] <GarbageNirvana> And then Scarlet dommed all of Midgar
[3:22:22] <sadboy_otoroshi> I'm trying to imagine how was the development of this game. Many things are just, unimportant. Is this a thing with RPG's or i just hate children.
[3:22:30] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Look at that one with the sunglasses
[3:22:33] <medril07> time to kill a pedo
[3:22:39] <zyueselive> The children have second-generation Mako Poisoning.
[3:22:42] <+TaterBurglar> PAY UP YOU LITTLE BRATS
[3:22:43] <AlfredoCavatelli> ok geralt
[3:22:46] <arkv01> ok harriet potter is kinda cool tho
[3:22:47] <+Jumpie8> what is up with her hair
[3:22:49] <arkv01> moneeeey!
[3:22:51] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Your reward is a mini boss to further pad out this chapter
[3:23:01] <%caramello_man> that kid is playing for keeps
[3:23:03] <Trinity5> sajamSegue4
[3:23:04] <Matrixvingian> This is Stranger Things Midgar.
[3:23:09] <+Jumpie8> Plague is about to go on a rampage
[3:23:13] <arkv01> we'll give you a tetanus infused nail bat!
[3:23:14] <+TaterBurglar> I mean they wouldn't model a nail bat for no reason
[3:23:16] <medril07> said the blind kid?
[3:23:18] <+caffienatedjedi> I want to see the blind kid fight hell house
[3:23:18] <Matrixvingian> Goonies and the Monster Squad weep.
[3:23:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> How autistic is Cloud.
[3:23:22] <arkv01> oh you BIG SOFTIE
[3:23:25] <FauxGateau> ew toad king jobs
[3:23:25] <zyueselive> Lmao, theres a Top Gear kid.
[3:23:32] <law240> SIMP
[3:23:35] <reinbachthe3rd> Throw in the Nail Bat.
[3:23:42] <Trinity5> it's also not the right end of the nail sticking otu
[3:23:46] <Trinity5> look at it again
[3:23:47] <medril07> nailbat sephiroth
[3:23:52] <GarbageNirvana> Fuckin Iceman in the glasses over here
[3:23:55] <luckycloud91> What do you think of the game so far? @PlagueOfGripes
[3:23:55] <cap_bon> Its this an orphanage for theatre kids
[3:23:58] <arkv01> cloud you're not imparting the correct lessons of living in a capitalistic society
[3:24:03] <+Jumpie8> Cloud doesn't give a fuck
[3:24:03] <GeltonZ> XD That's the best kid. FF7 version of Nes.
[3:24:09] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Look how fucking big you are compared to these kids
[3:24:09] <FauxGateau> @cap_bon actually probably
[3:24:14] <LunarRemix> Are they orphans is their parents abandoned them? @cap_bon
[3:24:18] <LunarRemix> If*
[3:24:18] <arkv01> cloud it canonically a manlet though
[3:24:20] <cap_bon> both
[3:24:22] <tokenreefer> dumb kids cannot solve problems themselves
[3:24:23] <FauxGateau> Cloud is just the biggest kid
[3:24:33] <MilkingEdge> the kids are killin plague
[3:24:34] <$studleydoorite> is a toad king just five toads with their asses entangled
[3:24:38] <+whiskey_wolfe_> You're doing fiiiiine Plague
[3:24:39] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Not that much further
[3:24:39] <Trinity5> yeah but who cares about everyone else
[3:24:40] <HyperBomb21> Its litrally just day 2
[3:24:40] <+TaterBurglar> I haven't even bought the game yet
[3:24:43] <HyperBomb21> Give it some time
[3:24:45] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes everyone else would not make artistic comments on stuff.
[3:24:46] <arkv01> not at all, max ended around the same area as you yesterday
[3:24:54] <zyueselive> doodMako
[3:24:57] <Trinity5> also a lot of bigger streamers refuse to like
[3:24:59] <Trinity5> read
[3:25:02] <FauxGateau> Ooo this sword has an enbiggened tip
[3:25:03] <Trinity5> so you're doing pretty well lol
[3:25:07] <ComfyFox> Kreygasm
[3:25:12] <Matrixvingian> Thanks for hanging with us regardless Plague.
[3:25:27] <FauxGateau> HOW DARE YOU
[3:25:34] <cap_bon> imagine looking at a games content DansGame
[3:25:46] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Although I got hit with a huge nostalgia boner when I saw Aerith's house
[3:25:49] <tokenreefer> its almost like you are enjoying the experience
[3:25:55] <HyperBomb21> Imagine playing a game at your own pace
[3:25:57] <Matrixvingian> Divinity ORiginal Sin 2 tactics.
[3:26:10] <Matrixvingian> I enjoy the analysis compared to a speed run.
[3:26:13] <arkv01> aerith's house is some primo real estate
[3:26:14] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> yeeees
[3:26:22] <Matrixvingian> The commentary lets me take my eyes off the screen for a few minutes as well.
[3:26:24] <law240> they aggro to who you're controling
[3:26:29] <arkv01> like cmon elmyra, you can house SO many orphans in that house
[3:26:33] <GeltonZ> The enemies in general target whoever you control, yeah
[3:26:41] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> AI knows target the healers first, play high lv Overwatch
[3:27:14] <suitangi021> @PlagueOfGripes how do you feel about the focus on staggering in this game?
[3:27:14] <%CyberDingus> Aerith you are NOT married to him!
[3:27:22] <arkv01> hedgepie be like "I hope I can confess to hedgepie C today...!" and then braver
[3:27:26] <sadboy_otoroshi> Aerith is like a that girl that spins a stick on parades.
[3:27:32] <tokenreefer> till death do you part
[3:27:33] <+StreamStopA> Toad king
[3:27:36] <Trinity5> baton twirler
[3:27:42] <Nelsukako> so.....are you liking it ? And the writing, think it is good besides the ghosts deus ex machina thing ?
[3:27:48] <EliahNebb> drum major
[3:27:51] <zyueselive> Wart from Mario in FF7:R
[3:28:24] <suitangi021> have you ever played Xenoblade chronicles?
[3:28:32] <+tymetak> Just Mario'ing all over her head
[3:28:33] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Do you think Squinex should remake more FF games in this style? Like 8 and 9?
[3:28:33] <arkv01> did we pack aeris with the best armor?
[3:28:36] <cap_bon> I'll show you what I can do euuurgh
[3:28:36] <+caffienatedjedi> I'll show you what I can do! Gets dunked on immediately.
[3:28:40] <arkv01> cause she really needs it
[3:29:27] <law240> is he equiped?
[3:29:35] <+tymetak> contextually sensitive summon maybe
[3:29:35] <+FunkyRot> its not full yet
[3:29:55] <arkv01> yeah check if ifrit is equipped after this
[3:30:16] <ckkc1> what do you think about the ARPG playstyle
[3:30:21] <ckkc1> just in general
[3:30:23] <arkv01> I hope a dedicated enough fanbase remakes 8 in UE
[3:30:24] <sad_toast_> bring back 8 like secret of Mana üòÖ
[3:30:25] <law240> they ducking on him
[3:30:31] <+whiskey_wolfe_> There are several story-critical moments in 8 that would have to be completely rewritten
[3:30:36] <arkv01> cause the 8 remaster is basically fuck you, no way
[3:31:08] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> They really crank up the sexual tension in these remakes, I don't think I could get past Quistis
[3:31:10] <sad_toast_> 7 was a master piece then they just kinda fart out 8
[3:31:11] <Nelsukako> maybe you are underlevel ?
[3:31:39] <law240> summon killed them
[3:31:39] <sad_toast_> maybe you just suck üòÖ jk jk tho lol
[3:31:43] <+caffienatedjedi> All the adds went down the moment you started focusing the king
[3:31:47] <ScreamLord> I don't think I've ever heard anyone even mention FF9
[3:31:50] <Trinity5> they were the time ghosts this whole time
[3:31:58] <+StreamStopA> Does anyone like the change away from the turn based combat that the FF series has done?
[3:31:59] <zyueselive> The Asess Materia would've helped some probably.
[3:32:00] <+aspirationdeath> i dont understand how peope arent sick of remakes now. like there have been some good ones but dont we want new games at this point?
[3:32:01] <suitangi021> is there a way to turn of the vignetting when at low health?
[3:32:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> 8 good until thery realise they were all orphans together, than it just keeps falling off a cliff into time bullshit
[3:32:11] <tokenreefer> maybe the real journey were the toads along the way
[3:32:23] <arkv01> yeah the 9ers will take ZERO shit from haters
[3:32:31] <law240> Check if you have ifirit equipped
[3:32:38] <arkv01> whereas 8 fans know its shit and wallow in it, as I do LUL
[3:32:44] <TheWe4pon> is ifrit equipped?
[3:32:54] <cap_bon> So I never played this but normally how long did it take from meeting aerith to meeting back up with avalanche ?
[3:32:54] <sad_toast_> again they kinda just farted out 8 üòÖ
[3:32:58] <fluffy_sauce> no depth?!
[3:32:59] <+whiskey_wolfe_> The main plot of 9 kinda falls apart once you get to the Lifa Tree
[3:32:59] <LunarRemix> I feel like I'm the only one who goes "Yeah FF1 was alright" No one ever mentions it
[3:33:01] <Trinity5> I remember when kids used to call shit smelly
[3:33:03] <badfaithmaxter> Sephiroth showing up too early in FF7 Remake is awful. That said, Kuja showing up earlier in an FF9 remake would be better.
[3:33:03] <law240> Nail bat Baby!!!
[3:33:04] <GeltonZ> 1, 12, and Crystal Chronicles here *gingerly raises hand*
[3:33:04] <+caffienatedjedi> nail bat
[3:33:06] <ckkc1> 5head
[3:33:07] <+StreamStopA> nail bat
[3:33:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> nail bat
[3:33:13] <+aspirationdeath> the main cast of 9 all have satisfying and dramatic arcs
[3:33:15] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:33:15] <Trinity5> nail bat
[3:33:16] <Nelsukako> the 10 one is pretty great beside the awkwards of some moments. Sphere grind is my favorite level system of any final fantasy
[3:33:22] <+StreamStopA> nail bat sells for 2 gil.
[3:33:24] <ScreamLord> I know so little about 9 that I thought 8 was 9
[3:33:38] <cap_bon> did the orginal have this only slum section
[3:33:47] <arkv01> nice lady
[3:33:47] <MilkingEdge> cloud wants the puss payments
[3:33:56] <ScreamLord> I hate her hair
[3:33:56] <sad_toast_> kids in most video games are so friggen weird looking
[3:33:58] <+whiskey_wolfe_> No, you must talk to more boring Poser models.
[3:34:02] <vonmaultke> these haircuts are ugly Jebaited
[3:34:05] <Kampler21> What FF game do you think deserves the ff7r treatment
[3:34:08] <tokenreefer> final fantasy has a way with making you annoyed half way through
[3:34:22] <Explodincatz> no more remakes
[3:34:24] <suitangi021> Kids are important, do you get it player!?
[3:34:25] <$Rivalshotzgp> Don‚Äôt you love the children
[3:34:26] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes that is her entire character though
[3:34:26] <sad_toast_> her hair looks like something died on her head
[3:34:26] <tokenreefer> ff10 for sure
[3:34:28] <Nelsukako> let her tell her backstory plague jeez
[3:34:28] <EuropanLamprey> No Plague, care about these characters slated to die so you'll feel emotions when the plate falls
[3:34:34] <+FunkyRot> her hair makes her head look weird
[3:34:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> yeeah no more remakes
[3:34:45] <%nerdbayne> these NPCs look fucking terrible compared to the MCs
[3:34:46] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Remake 6 perhaps. Certainly none of the newer ones.
[3:34:51] <Gavaline> Does she want to be an actress too?
[3:34:52] <sad_toast_> filler dialogue üôÑ
[3:34:53] <vonmaultke> Nomura Lecturing us NotLikeThis
[3:34:55] <tokenreefer> remake 10
[3:35:01] <law240> megamoCry megamoCry megamoCry
[3:35:06] <+caffienatedjedi> I want to drop a plate on myself after this
[3:35:12] <sad_toast_> No! Mura!!!
[3:35:12] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> just make a single player ff as good as Shadowbringers
[3:35:13] <Nelsukako> NO THO YOU CARE ABOUT STORI
[3:35:31] <+FunkyRot> i played this game up to the church and i can safely say i fucking hate this game
[3:35:35] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Anime children are cute and predictable 100% of the time.
[3:35:37] <tokenreefer> remake tactics
[3:35:39] <cap_bon> or they will say something really devastating
[3:35:41] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes They are REALLY building up Aerith for "The Thing" this time around aren't they?
[3:35:49] <vonmaultke> DansGame hate these kids
[3:35:56] <+StreamStopA> Wow this kid sure can take a beating.
[3:35:58] <+BurningLlama777> Yeah I don't know if anyone writing children has ever been around children.
[3:36:04] <EuropanLamprey> They're stupid but they're still human, video game children forget the human part
[3:36:14] <FauxGateau> that's why children need tragedy to be interesting.
[3:36:17] <Gavaline> >forgetting Berserk children
[3:36:20] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Wouldn't it be funny if she lives this time
[3:36:22] <FauxGateau> ^
[3:36:34] <sad_toast_> oh I've met some super smart kids üòÖ I've dated girls with very surprising children .. like your a terrible person but you kid is turning out great do idk ü§∑
[3:36:37] <Explodincatz> i want her to live just cause
[3:36:46] <Nelsukako> nanako of P4 was pretty great character tho
[3:36:51] <FauxGateau> The time ghosts will preserve her.
[3:36:56] <$Rivalshotzgp> Don‚Äôt you love children Cloud? - Cloud‚Äôs ‚Äúnot‚Äù girlfriend
[3:36:56] <suitangi021> There are only 2 good videogame kids. Clementine and Nanako
[3:36:57] <Trinity5> it all just boils down to
[3:36:59] <arkv01> this is true, it's up to your personal immersion
[3:37:01] <Trinity5> "fuck them kids"
[3:37:02] <MilkingEdge> Think of the chillenz
[3:37:05] <FauxGateau> eh i think nanako is overratted
[3:37:09] <+BurningLlama777> Video game children need to open-mouth cough onto produce more.
[3:37:11] <Trinity5> that cactuar is pretty neat lol
[3:37:14] <sad_toast_> "Kids are Useless Trash" lol
[3:37:19] <arkv01> but kids are mostly shit except for that cat kid in sector 7
[3:37:19] <+muzzle_roar24> rooDab
[3:37:30] <GeltonZ> I'M PICKLE CACTAAAAAAUR!!!
[3:37:32] <+StreamStopA> funniest shit I've ever seen
[3:37:34] <EuropanLamprey> He turns into a Cactus, funniest shi- I hate myself for typing that
[3:37:39] <tokenreefer> they write kids to be static and flat as hell
[3:37:40] <Gavaline> Has Marlene been as awful as all of these other kids so far?
[3:37:48] <Trinity5> @EuropanLamprey don't feel too bad, i was about to lol
[3:37:49] <ScreamLord> Children don't need MP anyways
[3:37:57] <sad_toast_> I want a dabbing cactar emote üòû
[3:37:58] <Nelsukako> overratted she sure is, but it is still a great character. ESPECIALLY compared to the other children characters in any fiction ever
[3:38:02] <arkv01> marlene is pretty subdued up to this point, not much to say about her
[3:38:10] <+StreamStopA> kids game
[3:38:15] <TheWe4pon> is the nail bat any good?
[3:38:17] <Trinity5> plague's gonna see a kid and just shut the stream off
[3:38:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Just god look at Aerith's house, so pretty
[3:38:18] <Trinity5> bet
[3:38:19] <law240> it sucks
[3:38:19] <BillieNoMates> convenience
[3:38:20] <suitangi021> It feels like these side tangents would be one to two lines of dialogue in the original game rather than full sidequest
[3:38:25] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Amenities. And the ability to lock my apartment door.
[3:38:25] <gnollAUS> They are rather unatural
[3:38:27] <ScreamLord> Poorely
[3:38:33] <EuropanLamprey> Never leave your apartment and invest in ear plugs
[3:38:35] <cap_bon> There not all outside at the once and the noise doesnt travel that far
[3:38:37] <arkv01> cities are mostly horrible except for the convenience of supermarkets being closeby
[3:38:39] <+justianxix> just get used to it, or be born there
[3:38:49] <+aspirationdeath> @arkv01 she has that cute ass voice tho. reminds me of boo from monsters inc
[3:38:51] <+BurningLlama777> City's just like the country except it's other humans standing around and bleating instead of livestock.
[3:38:52] <law240> you deal with it for the Salary
[3:39:01] <+BurningLlama777> Comparable intelligence too
[3:39:04] <Gavaline> They aren't living with it given the literal plague :^)
[3:39:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> spec out the bat
[3:39:06] <+caffienatedjedi> At least livestock is cute
[3:39:16] <sad_toast_> I live in a compact town with 2 burger kings and 2 McDonald's if that saying anything about how dense my town is
[3:39:16] <LunarRemix> Oh.
[3:39:22] <Nelsukako> i just want a place to buy things and come back to my cave. If it is a city than i guess i like it
[3:39:30] <law240> upgrade it
[3:39:32] <badbadverybad0> In the city, you get desensitized to people to the point where you no longer view others as living entities
[3:39:41] <arkv01> is it BIG damage?
[3:39:46] <suitangi021> You can test it if you play the game the kids were talking about
[3:39:47] <sad_toast_> cave man club
[3:39:56] <cap_bon> oh god this screen eww eww
[3:40:11] <arkv01> square knew!
[3:40:15] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes How did the children get Growth Materia into the bat? ANd if not them way was it built with it?
[3:40:17] <+StreamStopA> nail bat run
[3:40:37] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A bat powered by children's dreams
[3:40:40] <EuropanLamprey> When's the foam nerf sword with 16 materia slots?
[3:40:51] <+StreamStopA> Can you beat FF7 with only the nail bat?
[3:41:02] <law240> Manual
[3:41:14] <TheWe4pon> manual?
[3:41:18] <law240> Luck effects Crit %
[3:41:19] <Nelsukako> kids are good loli material tho
[3:41:26] <cap_bon> ...
[3:41:35] <Trinity5> i thnk luck affects steal as well
[3:41:36] <EuropanLamprey> disapproves of that
[3:41:41] <Trinity5> yeah if there's no mug then fuck steal
[3:41:42] <+aspirationdeath> @nelsukako mods?
[3:41:57] <Explodincatz> gid doesnt even matter in most FF games
[3:42:13] <Nelsukako> just kiddin ._. calm your titts
[3:42:25] <EuropanLamprey> no
[3:42:29] <+aspirationdeath> very funny
[3:42:47] <%JailShmixRemix> Not very funny
[3:42:48] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I'm not sure if you like or hate this game yet, LUL
[3:42:55] <law240> it's great on barret
[3:42:59] <Trinity5> pretty bog standard luck stat
[3:42:59] <Nelsukako> i know. I like to think i am to maintain my self-steem
[3:43:01] <Trinity5> HUH
[3:43:18] <FauxGateau> It's gonna be vincent clearly.
[3:43:25] <Gavaline> He has long silver hair and a big washing pole sword
[3:43:29] <law240> Gold Saucer music is nice
[3:43:36] <Trinity5> alright well that's the handler from monster hunter
[3:43:41] <EuropanLamprey> It's the Reinforced club from Dark Souls, except as a great club and not secretly the best weapon in the game
[3:43:41] <+aspirationdeath> @nelsukako saying wildly innappropiate shit isnt just inherently funny. try harder
[3:43:43] <sadboy_otoroshi> wasn't that also King Cold's technique
[3:43:46] <Fenlig> Wack the children instead
[3:43:55] <Dark_Wint3r> @aspirationdeath PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[3:44:00] <cap_bon> if cool adults are allowed wheres bike guy?
[3:44:04] <+justianxix> Only the cool kids
[3:44:06] <Trinity5> it's not great lol
[3:44:07] <%JailShmixRemix> An elixir
[3:44:10] <+arancet> its not bad
[3:44:11] <Gavaline> No, no it won't
[3:44:11] <Huntercd> Shit kids
[3:44:18] <GarbageNirvana> kids think you're cool though
[3:44:28] <Trinity5> my favorite game that takes 7 years to set up
[3:44:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> get the big prize then spam it to get medals
[3:44:30] <Murphio_GS> I like how they're a specific age
[3:44:31] <FauxGateau> Now this is what should've been added to the base game.
[3:44:32] <Murphio_GS> all of them
[3:44:35] <EuropanLamprey> This single room would take an hour to set up
[3:44:36] <GarbageNirvana> don't you want to be cool?
[3:44:41] <BonemanJohn> Are you at least enjoying the core aspects of the game? anything that is from the original
[3:44:46] <arkv01> use atb I guess?
[3:44:50] <%nerdbayne> getting kingdom hearts vibes with this mini game
[3:44:52] <Gavaline> This is what Nomura's time ghosts were all leading up to
[3:44:53] <%JailShmixRemix> I like how the boxes are 4x taller than the kids themselves
[3:44:55] <Trinity5> you can use your atb, as well
[3:45:04] <$Rivalshotzgp> Why would they let cloud of all people destroy their boxes?
[3:45:17] <GarbageNirvana> also maybe if you beat this and become Master of The hideout you can boss them around
[3:45:25] <+Neoripo> Bat is the worst for doing this
[3:45:28] <CaramelTaffy> I am glad there are dumb mini games in this
[3:45:49] <redial_nick> they use guns
[3:45:49] <%JailShmixRemix> Children are strong
[3:45:49] <+caffienatedjedi> Why do you think the target score is so low?
[3:45:50] <Fenlig> The childrend also know combo
[3:45:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Wow this is very intensive. These kids have a real knack for craft.
[3:45:53] <Gavaline> Because of how wonderful and angelic they are
[3:45:53] <arkv01> all these children are SOLDIER candidates
[3:46:01] <%JailShmixRemix> They are already SOLDIERS
[3:46:05] <%JailShmixRemix> First class
[3:46:09] <Trinity5> kids love hitting shit with boxes
[3:46:12] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Played the demo before I bought the game and I hope this transfers to the full game as well, but my PS4 runs surprisingly quietly for this game
[3:46:23] <EuropanLamprey> Maybe not use the joke weapon for this
[3:46:31] <PurestKanadaJin> Using a stronger sword makes it easier to destroy the boxes
[3:46:31] <+Neoripo> Use buster sword, trust me
[3:46:34] <Trinity5> @PlagueOfGripes you can use atb but there's no soft lock so you gotta aim it carefully
[3:46:41] <suitangi021> It's easier with a better weapon
[3:46:47] <luckycloud91> use buster sword with atb moves
[3:46:57] <GarbageNirvana> Thanks Amy Rose
[3:47:13] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I meant the game running quieter than most
[3:47:17] <MilkingEdge> Cloud likes beat the kids.....highscore
[3:47:23] <+XxBTExX> Whack her box
[3:47:35] <GarbageNirvana> @XxBTExX RANDY NO
[3:47:46] <law240> atb?
[3:47:47] <Huntercd> Shouldn't these kids be in school?
[3:47:54] <TreesDontTalk> doodDerp OUR FAVORITE GAME
[3:47:55] <Trinity5> braver
[3:48:04] <Trinity5> bravers not half bad here
[3:48:30] <Trinity5> theres no soft lock so sometimes it whiffs pretty badly
[3:48:39] <+justianxix> You could use the shortcuts
[3:49:11] <Huntercd> How does Shinra function if its worker base is dumb as a box of rocks?
[3:49:39] <%JailShmixRemix> Dammit cloud
[3:49:48] <NiktenKing> Triple slash might be better cause horizontals
[3:49:54] <FauxGateau> whack whack whack huh?
[3:49:58] <Trinity5> cmon kid don't tell me to whack whack whack
[3:49:59] <+justianxix> whack whack whack the kids
[3:50:04] <+Neoripo> WAKKA BOX
[3:50:04] <BonemanJohn> ....wack...
[3:50:07] <SonofStranger> an actual human being said that line
[3:50:14] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Where are the leaderboards for this?
[3:50:16] <sadboy_otoroshi> I think they should add like an lock on, if there is actually one it doesn't show.
[3:50:20] <FauxGateau> So far this game is epic in my eyes
[3:50:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> How good can these kids possibly be
[3:50:22] <Trinity5> 50's are good for putting you over the edge
[3:50:31] <GarbageNirvana> Seems like aim for the big ones and if you get some 50s along the way that's nice too
[3:50:37] <TreesDontTalk> doodSmug "I bet ZACK could get 30000"
[3:50:39] <GarbageNirvana> Or if you just need a little bit
[3:50:43] <cap_bon> this is alot of work for an exlier
[3:50:44] <Trinity5> yeah there's no lock on for this mini game @sadboy_otoroshi
[3:50:44] <Huntercd> Wakka box instead of boxes its Al Bhed
[3:51:23] <GarbageNirvana> Gotta use your blitzball though, ya?
[3:51:31] <+caffienatedjedi> Going for straight points it feels like the small ones might be faster, but you have to clear the big ones to get more time on the clock.
[3:51:34] <Trinity5> better dead than al bhed ye?
[3:51:40] <+caffienatedjedi> So in the end, big ones first still
[3:51:45] <sadboy_otoroshi> Test button mashing and positioning.
[3:52:16] <NiktenKing> Maybe triple slash?
[3:52:33] <law240> you missed a room
[3:52:34] <Trinity5> triple slash is pretty good for the 50 towers
[3:52:38] <+stickmanbond> anyone else's stream a bit chunkyy?
[3:52:44] <+Neoripo> Buff attack with the weapon sphere grid
[3:52:47] <%JailShmixRemix> Yeah it probably takes a lot of specific focused thrusts and bravers
[3:52:54] <+justianxix> think you got it down, just need to be faster
[3:52:59] <+StreamStopA> go for time first then ignore the last 1500?
[3:53:13] <%JailShmixRemix> Too many particles on stream
[3:53:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> Do you get the same moveset with different weapons?
[3:53:26] <BonemanJohn> did you catch the timer right at the start on the right?
[3:53:38] <LunarRemix> It probably has to do with using Haste and abusing the ATB attacks.
[3:53:57] <LunarRemix> Or some very specific accesory that helps with ATB
[3:54:22] <Trinity5> nah plague's got it
[3:54:43] <%JailShmixRemix> Yeah he's got this one
[3:54:51] <Trinity5> oh hey @JailShmixRemix fancing seeing you here
[3:54:55] <LunarRemix> Oh wow
[3:54:59] <+Neoripo> There is also a path going to your right when you start
[3:54:59] <Trinity5> sajamHoop
[3:55:00] <NiktenKing> Got'em
[3:55:00] <arkv01> I feel bad about smashing these carefully hand crafted boxes with the stitched on numbers
[3:55:00] <+caffienatedjedi> Way better this time
[3:55:05] <LunarRemix> Good one mate.
[3:55:14] <%JailShmixRemix> @Trinity5 sajamSegue4 I am everywhere
[3:55:21] <+muzzle_roar24> rooBonk
[3:55:22] <Trinity5> lol
[3:55:42] <GarbageNirvana> Not even gonna pinky toe swear
[3:55:44] <+0ni0n_L0rd> RIP
[3:55:52] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> requip the bat?
[3:55:52] <law240> Ghetto Golden Saucer
[3:55:52] <suitangi021> Triple slash seems to do the most damage
[3:55:54] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Goodbye forever children
[3:55:56] <FauxGateau> No loading zone demands your attention
[3:55:57] <cap_bon> we will never return and not jsut because of plates being drop
[3:55:57] <law240> it's loading
[3:55:57] <arkv01> so going by the gold saucer theme, this is supposed to be the mini-game haven in episode 1?
[3:56:02] <+aspirationdeath> not even for MoOglE COIns?!
[3:56:09] <suitangi021> I think you get a moogle medal each time you do it
[3:56:11] <PurestKanadaJin> Just entering the minigame and letting the time run out lets you farm moogle coins easy
[3:56:11] <NiktenKing> Cloud, I feel trapped...
[3:56:19] <Trinity5> @NiktenKing LUL
[3:56:26] <TheWe4pon> Don't forget to change back to nail bat
[3:56:46] <arkv01> daily fuzz
[3:56:48] <+StreamStopA> a lier huh
[3:56:49] <Trinity5> at least pick a color for your hat that acutaly matches
[3:56:50] <arkv01> absolutely awufl
[3:56:55] <Trinity5> AND he's got an armband
[3:57:01] <tokenreefer> real question... should i purchase this game?
[3:57:03] <GarbageNirvana> Ugh, a centrist
[3:57:04] <NiktenKing> Look at this goober
[3:57:06] <+NovaKnightmare> Fucking Yellow Journalist
[3:57:09] <+caffienatedjedi> Can't trust people with armbands
[3:57:14] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Maybe if it wasn't red
[3:57:17] <gensoukaizou> which dev or youtuber is this
[3:57:19] <sadboy_otoroshi> I guess that happens when a lineal RPG gets the open-world realism treatment Plague.
[3:57:23] <FauxGateau> Fight him. consume his mako
[3:57:23] <arkv01> oooh phantom thief?
[3:57:24] <seth45er> everybody are to clean in this slum
[3:57:26] <+Jumpie8> sure bud
[3:57:27] <arkv01> she BETTER be hot
[3:57:32] <EuropanLamprey> Yes she is
[3:57:35] <Trinity5> if she's hot then she's morally grey
[3:57:35] <+aspirationdeath> @tokenreefer does anyone here know the first thing about what you would like?
[3:57:46] <arkv01> well then she has my pants and more
[3:57:49] <+Jumpie8> he's a walking douche bag
[3:57:50] <tokenreefer> im just on the fence ya digg
[3:57:54] <karl_rex> Literally I want to find Robin Hood
[3:58:00] <%CyberDingus> Damon, you dumb reporter, you have an armband.
[3:58:07] <Trinity5> THICC
[3:58:08] <+StreamStopA> it's her
[3:58:10] <EuropanLamprey> She's hotter than Tifa
[3:58:14] <LunarRemix> Man you really nailed it with that beauty = morally grey thing huh
[3:58:18] <Trinity5> there's no way it's not her lol
[3:58:21] <tokenreefer> i like ff but 60 bucks? is it worth it?
[3:58:22] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> best girl
[3:58:25] <kegory> She's a hottie
[3:58:32] <+caffienatedjedi> That is like the most stereotypical old lady who is still outdoorsy
[3:58:36] <Trinity5> i mean you'll get your money's worth
[3:58:39] <+NovaKnightmare> she looks like a retired Final fantasy Pre-FF7 party member
[3:58:42] <Trinity5> will you enjoy it tho?
[3:58:43] <Trinity5> up to you
[3:58:51] <FauxGateau> seems cool to me.
[3:59:07] <cyberblueneon> half of this game is literally a naruto filler episode
[3:59:23] <tokenreefer> i got 15 and was disappointed towards the end. if its anything like the mid/early game of ff15 then im down
[3:59:29] <FauxGateau> that's what i think about what FF7 needed, more filler
[3:59:32] <sadboy_otoroshi> @caffienatedjedi My mother literally said that she would like to look like that when she grow up (or down).
[3:59:36] <karl_rex> Thats a cool remix of the victory theme
[4:00:04] <Trinity5> have you tried talking to mireille, aka the angel of the slums
[4:00:06] <+StreamStopA> needed work for the voice actors
[4:00:28] <+aspirationdeath> @tokenreefer excellent combat, music and bosses are the highlight. you get more time with the core cast and some of that is interesting. whats not interesting is the tasteless padding that is the sidequests.
[4:00:29] <london_flexing> @cyberblueneon yea, this is just a yakuza game now
[4:00:33] <arkv01> this game has my erection every chapter
[4:00:38] <Trinity5> how the hell are you wearing that jacket in this heat
[4:01:04] <tokenreefer> gotcha ill slurge i guess
[4:01:22] <Trinity5> investigate makeout point
[4:01:45] <%CyberDingus> Cloud should say ''pay me first''
[4:01:46] <+BurningLlama777> The ~annnngel~? OooOOoOooo it's like that THING
[4:01:47] <cap_bon> people in these slums seem to forget what mercenary means
[4:01:47] <+Neoripo> It's worth it
[4:01:53] <+Neoripo> but be prepared
[4:01:54] <LunarRemix> Angeal!
[4:01:55] <NiktenKing> LUL
[4:02:07] <+StreamStopA> hallway hero
[4:02:11] <+BurningLlama777> Boy a fire would just rip right through this slum. Just saying.
[4:02:18] <+TheyTookMyBeard> GHOSTS? Why this game so scaru
[4:02:28] <sadboy_otoroshi> In a scale of 1 to 20 ¬øHow strong is Cloud's pussymagnet?
[4:02:30] <+StreamStopA> its like 3 min
[4:02:33] <sad_toast_> get walking ü§∑
[4:02:34] <Trinity5> 25
[4:02:42] <+BurningLlama777> So many hallways
[4:02:44] <+Neoripo> Did you get the materia in the church?
[4:02:58] <+aspirationdeath> @tokenreefer also the materia and weapon systems scratch that jrpg stat building itch that xv never fulfilled
[4:03:03] <Trinity5> dokapon
[4:03:09] <Trinity5> so someone's probably dying
[4:03:11] <NiktenKing> Salt Kingdom

[4:05:08] <+muzzle_roar24> Absolute Unit
[4:05:08] <sadboy_otoroshi> Is a machine only move, the game is not that generous.

[4:08:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Did you go back to the church for the useless materia left there?
[4:08:37] <Explodincatz> thats improbable
[4:09:35] <+Neoripo> you can now
[4:09:36] <Trinity5> uhhhhhh
[4:10:13] <NiktenKing> As it should be
[4:10:19] <+MrWrann> No do combo here, only big damage
[4:10:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I think you actually can go back now.
[4:10:34] <LunarRemix> This piece of shit was made by Shinra?
[4:10:37] <sadboy_otoroshi> beeg thicc ball
[4:10:49] <+aspirationdeath> the linearity of this wouldnt be so distracting if theyd just let you backtrack freely. its probably why they feel the nees to let you know if youre about to leave behind items in an area
[4:10:59] <sadboy_otoroshi> I guess that happens when a lineal RPG gets the open-world realism treatment Plague.
[4:10:59] <+aspirationdeath> need*
[4:11:09] <TonberryLives> Probably put itself back together multiple times using scrap
[4:11:20] <terminusterminal> I guess double casting thundara will ruin him?
[4:11:37] <Trinity5> sp what does the ward do?
[4:11:58] <TimetodiveLTX> is this the right chat to say aerith's VA sucks
[4:12:12] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yes
[4:12:15] <+aspirationdeath> it does sucks
[4:12:23] <LunarRemix> Yeah it was lol
[4:13:00] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:13:24] <badfaithmaxter> Man, this combat would frustrate me to no end. I couldn't see myself playing this after it stops being held hostage and all the parts are available.
[4:13:36] <sadboy_otoroshi> was this an enemy in the original?
[4:13:46] <TimetodiveLTX> no iirc
[4:13:58] <Trinity5> damn
[4:14:00] <Trinity5> sajamSmoked
[4:14:03] <NiktenKing> BONKED
[4:14:05] <+Neoripo> The small ones yes
[4:14:33] <TimetodiveLTX> you are definitely locked on to the ball right now
[4:14:40] <TimetodiveLTX> and now you're not
[4:14:43] <+MrWrann> This seems like a really long fight
[4:14:56] <+aspirationdeath> @badfaithmaxter you just need to exploit weaknesses to put them into stagger states kinda like persona
[4:14:58] <+Neoripo> ATB
[4:15:02] <NiktenKing> ATB
[4:15:03] <+StreamStopA> need more atb?
[4:15:10] <+BigCoffee> You tlaking about the DLC summons?
[4:15:21] <+aspirationdeath> are you sure you have him equipped?
[4:15:24] <BillieNoMates> Clouds silenced
[4:15:32] <+BigCoffee> It's just boss fights, summons are made only for special fights + bosses
[4:15:37] <+Neoripo> i think you nailed it, real summons are for events
[4:15:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It seems that summons are only for the big bosses.
[4:15:41] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> Plgaue, one of my video got copyrighted because a guy made a Circus Theme Remix and I used the original. Any thought?
[4:15:45] <NiktenKing> Not stepping into the Silence gas
[4:15:45] <+ArmoredTeeth> Cloud is silenced I think
[4:15:49] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes Simple, the battle you're in doesn't normally allow Summons. Chocochick, Cactuar and Carbuncle can all participate in smaller battles, the preorder Summons are special in this way.
[4:15:49] <terminusterminal> The DLC summons can come out anytime I guess
[4:15:53] <TheWe4pon> foud on gamegaqs
[4:15:55] <+aspirationdeath> hes able to summon the chick though
[4:16:02] <+BigCoffee> the dlc summons are also much weaker
[4:16:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> aren't they tied to materia?
[4:16:35] <+aspirationdeath> the summon bar wouldnt even appear if summons werent available
[4:16:35] <+Neoripo> yep
[4:16:41] <+Typhaeon> Did you equip Ifrit on the bat?
[4:16:47] <+BigCoffee> yeah but chocobo chick is a small summon
[4:17:05] <+aspirationdeath> i think you might just not have him equipped atm
[4:17:06] <karl_rex> WTH is that chocobo shaped like?
[4:17:06] <BillieNoMates> just fucking mushed Aerith
[4:17:07] <+BigCoffee> oh typh is right
[4:17:20] <+BigCoffee> is ifrit on the bat?
[4:17:25] <+Typhaeon> Been sort of popping in and out, didn't see
[4:17:31] <sadboy_otoroshi> that DIO sound effect!
[4:17:38] <terminusterminal> Yes he is as far as I can tell
[4:17:46] <TimetodiveLTX> is there a way to switch lockon targets?
[4:17:54] <Trinity5> there is
[4:18:17] <+aspirationdeath> dpad was it?
[4:18:17] <sadboy_otoroshi> by pressing L3?
[4:18:31] <+caffienatedjedi> He has to sprint in circles first
[4:18:32] <+MrWrann> Literally ran in circles when you asked
[4:18:35] <+StreamStopA> the ai sucks
[4:18:47] <TonberryLives> Nah, he just wanted to run in a circle LUL
[4:18:54] <+EpicureanIguana> was he... running in circles just now?
[4:18:55] <+BigCoffee> the ai is lackluster just enough for you to have to input commands
[4:19:11] <terminusterminal> Is regen any good?
[4:19:40] <+Neoripo> Aerith LB almost ready
[4:19:41] <Gavaline> And so the longing for the old battle system continues to grow
[4:19:46] <Trinity5> i definitely wish the abilities were more non interruptible
[4:20:16] <ScreamLord> He's
[4:20:24] <ScreamLord> Cloud's got this
[4:20:25] <Trinity5> yeah that's not great lol
[4:20:35] <$Abelltronics17> Corgo100 hhmmm whats that smell
[4:20:41] <TimetodiveLTX> i'm an anti turnbased extremist so this is fine
[4:20:42] <TonberryLives> Ow
[4:20:49] <+Neoripo> LUL
[4:20:50] <TimetodiveLTX> i'll just git gud
[4:20:51] <Trinity5> aerith "son of a bitch, cloud"
[4:20:51] <+BigCoffee> at least you can kill the boss with the LB now
[4:20:52] <+EpicureanIguana> it'd be fine if enemies had less health and dealt more damage in return healthsponges are never fun
[4:20:54] <sad_toast_> you said Aeris ...
[4:20:58] <+muzzle_roar24> rooSlain Cloud you are so weak
[4:21:05] <Shadope342> LUL
[4:21:06] <Trinity5> that's the NWF face
[4:21:11] <Trinity5> that's 100% the NWF face
[4:21:13] <LunarRemix> She does indeed looks fine
[4:21:14] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes apparently preorder DLC summons are special and can be summoned in "smaller" fights
[4:21:23] <Gavaline> What is that face!?
[4:21:38] <+BigCoffee> They're weaker and smaller
[4:21:40] <sad_toast_> N W F? ü§î
[4:21:43] <+MrWrann> I love how the thing that causes your weapon to bounce is on the right side of Cloud, who is right handed, guaranteeing you bounce a whole bunch
[4:21:56] <TimetodiveLTX> No Way Friendo
[4:21:57] <+BigCoffee> Can you use cactuar instead? He's chill as fuck
[4:22:24] <Gavaline> Not Happening Homosexual
[4:22:25] <sad_toast_> AWWWW but not friendo üëåü§êüòú
[4:22:34] <+BigCoffee> They aren't better, but they are better then nothing
[4:22:35] <Trinity5> i wonder how much damage the bigass swing is reduced by if you block it
[4:22:45] <Trinity5> cause from what i've seen the dodge in this game has no i frames lol
[4:22:53] <TonberryLives> That's kinda crap
[4:22:58] <+Neoripo> DLC ones are not so strong but can be used whenever
[4:23:04] <+MrWrann> I like his hat
[4:23:12] <Explodincatz> no I frames for u
[4:23:14] <Trinity5> i bet she's very morally grey
[4:23:28] <FauxGateau> Man this old lady va is one of my favorites
[4:24:01] <terminusterminal> She's laying it on so thick.
[4:24:15] <FauxGateau> Cause she's Oooold wom
[4:24:21] <sadboy_otoroshi> I think the combat system was bodged at last minute, the ai doesn't behave like it would on a hack'n'slash.
[4:24:32] <+MrWrann> "no harm, no foul" flashback to Cloud being smashed into the ground numerous times
[4:24:32] <vonmaultke> LUL
[4:24:33] <sad_toast_> corn-holieo
[4:24:46] <Trinity5> maybe they thought corny-o was too on the nose sajamSegue4
[4:24:46] <vonmaultke> Corn- a-o
[4:24:49] <TonberryLives> I like her
[4:24:55] <Murphio_GS> Hot you mean?
[4:24:59] <sad_toast_> corn a hiey
[4:25:10] <MilkingEdge> corn hole
[4:25:17] <Trinity5> a warm cup of milk and a high five
[4:25:18] <+StreamStopA> iron bat
[4:25:18] <%CyberDingus> "Let's go home!"

[4:25:35] <FauxGateau> Plague is a seer

[4:26:05] <+MrWrann> NorthernLion?
[4:26:12] <sadboy_otoroshi> wasn't Aerith supposed to hurry in order to take Cloud home beacuse is too far away.
[4:26:25] <FauxGateau> Holy hell the voice is on point.
[4:26:37] <Trinity5> yeah rude's va was a good choice
[4:27:06] <agadejobi> FUN FACT: Rude has a crush on Tifa!
[4:27:07] <MilkingEdge> Rude is Plague in a suit
[4:27:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Very Korean gangster, no guns just Tae Kwon Do
[4:27:15] <Explodincatz> kid
[4:27:18] <Trinity5> lol the nail bat
[4:27:20] <sadboy_otoroshi> he said it
[4:27:25] <LunarRemix> He looks goofy with that bat
[4:27:29] <%CyberDingus> Ufffff
[4:27:31] <FauxGateau> He kicked you like 3 feet away.
[4:27:33] <LunarRemix> Like a Kingdom hearts character
[4:27:33] <agadejobi> Oh jesus christ, he's actually using the nailbat
[4:27:34] <Trinity5> "all bark no bite" cloud your ass is about to get giant swung
[4:27:39] <+MrWrann> Because he has to cross his T's and dot his I's
[4:27:43] <TimetodiveLTX> YO

[4:27:54] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[4:27:54] <Explodincatz> damn son
[4:27:55] <%ragerunner2020> This guys great
[4:28:01] <Gavaline> So now it's a straight up fighting game. Neat.
[4:28:02] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Weak to Wind
[4:28:06] <MilkingEdge> all bark no bite
[4:28:14] <+caffienatedjedi> I've been loving the Turks in this game. So many other problems but they are cool.
[4:28:29] <seth45er> he's easily winded
[4:28:30] <Trinity5> resistance to time magic?
[4:28:42] <Trinity5> damn get fucked rude
[4:28:59] <BillieNoMates> He sleeps
[4:29:00] <+MrWrann> Pocket sand
[4:29:07] <Trinity5> he's doing strangz
[4:29:17] <Murphio_GS> He's just so rude
[4:29:19] <sadboy_otoroshi> pocket sand
[4:29:22] <+muzzle_roar24> Gets a mage, boss has something to put her to sleep LUL
[4:29:23] <Trinity5> aerith just over here vibing
[4:29:26] <BillieNoMates> Can't wait till the coach jumps in and screams "USE THE OXYGEN BETWEEN YOUR CELLS"
[4:29:30] <Shadope342> LUL that looks a+ from aeriths perspective
[4:29:54] <+Crimznking> Bald Terry Bogard beatin' your ass Plague?
[4:29:57] <Thatdan> Hes a rude guy
[4:29:57] <FauxGateau> So cool. Of course he has another pair
[4:29:57] <BillieNoMates> Oh shit. Those were $500 ssunglasses, asshole
[4:29:59] <+caffienatedjedi> Just pulls out another pair of glasses, amazing
[4:30:01] <Johnmaddened> he just has more sunglasses LUL
[4:30:04] <Trinity5> he has another pair of sunglasses lol
[4:30:14] <Run44forrest> why are you fighting pitbull
[4:30:25] <%Megabulldog> The AI cant handle this
[4:30:27] <+EpicureanIguana> Erit dmg ResidentSleeper
[4:30:27] <LunarRemix> That kind of implies he uses shitty cheap sunglasses though.
[4:30:30] <FauxGateau> I'm marking out over this fight so hard.
[4:30:47] <Trinity5> maybe you can outrun the sleep attack?
[4:30:49] <BillieNoMates> Just roll out with the right timing
[4:31:02] <terminusterminal> justified self defense rush
[4:31:13] <BillieNoMates> But sleep just works anyway so you have to deal with it
[4:31:16] <TimetodiveLTX> i agree that the change in combat is a little much if you're expecting normal ATB
[4:31:44] <Trinity5> luckily cloud almost has lmit so done deal
[4:31:45] <terminusterminal> Is regen any good?
[4:31:47] <Trinity5> and there we go
[4:31:51] <BillieNoMates> Carried by Aerith atm LUL
[4:32:16] <+MrWrann> Who's the bodyguard here?
[4:32:25] <+aspirationdeath> youd have to learn his moveset. he has some parryable attacks, blockables, unblockables and grabs
[4:32:32] <TimetodiveLTX> in DMC and Bayo you could stop enemies from attacking if they were off camera
[4:32:39] <BillieNoMates> The lense break was from Advent Children I think?
[4:32:42] <+muzzle_roar24> I guess Rude is programmed to only use less lethal actions when player switches to Aerith
[4:32:45] <Trinity5> nice ringtone jackass
[4:33:09] <badfaithmaxter> Why is his phone a PSP?
[4:33:14] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:33:21] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> stay home loser
[4:33:27] <$Captain_Krunk> Fucking love Ruth LUL
[4:33:40] <+ClericOfSparda> It's like a sibling relationship with Rude
[4:33:41] <Run44forrest> god i hate her
[4:33:50] <terminusterminal> Is Tseng gonna slap her in the face?
[4:33:50] <BillieNoMates> She's high potential so the Turks are just keeping tabs on her
[4:34:03] <$Captain_Krunk> ^
[4:34:04] <+MrWrann> Maguffen her
[4:34:06] <BillieNoMates> Well Hojo wants her to bang a dog
[4:34:09] <TheWe4pon> beastialtity porn apparently
[4:34:17] <+Queenemereldas> it gets addressed late
[4:34:22] <+Queenemereldas> later
[4:34:23] <+ClericOfSparda> Totally for bestiality porn
[4:34:34] <LunarRemix> But Red XIII isn't of age.
[4:34:36] <+BigCoffee> its addressed later like Queen says
[4:34:38] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I mean you find out next chapter a little
[4:34:39] <LunarRemix> He's like 16
[4:34:39] <%bettysharkface> And that was a weird line to come back to
[4:34:50] <Trinity5> in human years, right?
[4:34:53] <Trinity5> isn't red like
[4:34:54] <Trinity5> 84
[4:34:56] <Kampler21> Woman fucking doggo WutFace
[4:35:10] <BillieNoMates> Aerith is giving him sass
[4:35:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> God this area nostalgia bombed me hard
[4:35:24] <tolloponik> or everything
[4:35:26] <BillieNoMates> Well he was trying to get some payback for Reno
[4:35:27] <+MrWrann> Lives up to his name
[4:35:29] <mapimb> they're waiting for her to be as fertile as possible
[4:35:33] <BillieNoMates> and that nail bat is so retarded
[4:35:39] <TheWe4pon> shinra totally has a porn division yeah?
[4:35:44] <BillieNoMates> the nails being that way make no sense
[4:35:44] <+Neoripo> He wanted payback for trashing reno
[4:35:56] <Trinity5> yeah the nail bat is a t for teen nailbat
[4:36:00] <Trinity5> not an m for mature
[4:36:00] <+EpicureanIguana> @BillieNoMates How dare you?! DansGame
[4:36:00] <LunarRemix> That's the division Scarlet is in charge of.
[4:36:22] <badfaithmaxter> I've been waiting for a "dilly-dally, shilly-shally" line given how bad the dialogue gets
[4:36:24] <Run44forrest> oh god shes crazy
[4:36:44] <+ArmoredTeeth> "Kill them all, Aeris"
[4:36:47] <Trinity5> wall market
[4:36:49] <fluffy_sauce> Wall Market
[4:36:49] <Explodincatz> past the next area
[4:36:55] <tolloponik> he's at Corneo
[4:36:59] <Explodincatz> so your really close to him
[4:36:59] <BillieNoMates> He's already prepping the trap moment
[4:36:59] <%CyberDingus> "bang him, girl"
[4:37:13] <Trinity5> "no way, friendo"
[4:37:18] <karl_rex> Everyone getting mad at Paige's Aerith impression is funny
[4:37:23] <Gavaline> "Beware the time ghosts"
[4:37:35] <FauxGateau> Giving up is a good trick
[4:37:40] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Flowers: "You guys should bone!"
[4:37:56] <Trinity5> "oh cloud, you dumb fuck"
[4:38:00] <%caramello_man> cloud you big dork
[4:38:05] <Run44forrest> ???
[4:38:11] <+ArmoredTeeth> "gg no re"
[4:38:19] <+caffienatedjedi> I'm glad we got dork cloud still
[4:38:53] <badbadverybad0> Is it bad that I have the urge to smash her head in, for no reason?
[4:38:55] <TheWe4pon> "Blood"
[4:39:31] <+MrWrann> Dinner? It looks like it's 3 PM at latest
[4:39:34] <+ArmoredTeeth> Time to talk about the birds and the bees
[4:39:35] <BillieNoMates> Rude comes into a fight barehanded so Cloud starts swinging his giant bat at him
[4:39:35] <%CyberDingus> what did she say about load off?
[4:39:37] <sadboy_otoroshi> did she just say that?
[4:39:41] <Trinity5> it's like 6pm
[4:39:44] <Gavaline> "Listen Cloud, I need you to impregnate my daughter. She's ovulating right now."
[4:39:56] <+ArmoredTeeth> Leon pls
[4:40:04] <FauxGateau> Lol thanks for laying it out like that random miss
[4:40:11] <TonberryLives> She's not wrong
[4:40:12] <terminusterminal> That's real presumptuous of her.
[4:40:24] <BillieNoMates> Cloud mumsie
[4:40:28] <Trinity5> milf
[4:40:36] <conchubar11> have you seen the "Dragonball Durag" music video Plague?
[4:40:38] <Explodincatz> who needs to know someone when u can just prejudice
[4:40:41] <+ArmoredTeeth> like Barrett
[4:40:42] <badfaithmaxter> "Claudia" What a lazy name
[4:40:45] <BillieNoMates> MUM, THIS ISNT HENTAI
[4:40:46] <karl_rex> She looks like a female cloud
[4:40:47] <BillieNoMates> STOP THIS

[4:41:00] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Isn't that what she's going for?
[4:41:02] <%JailShmixRemix> Barrett best girl confirmed
[4:41:03] <FauxGateau> fake mom
[4:41:05] <badfaithmaxter> I'm surprised they didn't call her Cloudette
[4:41:08] <Explodincatz> Coud go find a MILF - Mom
[4:41:11] <Run44forrest> shes not dead?
[4:41:16] <Gavaline> And with that, a hundred new doujins were drafted
[4:41:22] <Trinity5> oh boy will they
[4:41:22] <FauxGateau> It was the before tim
[4:41:36] <+Neoripo> Here we go
[4:41:38] <+Neoripo> LUL
[4:41:42] <+ArmoredTeeth> Sneaking tutorial LUL
[4:41:44] <%CyberDingus> "Cloud I know you are dumb - find a mature woman that will keep you out of problems''
[4:41:48] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It's too bad he never meets a girl like that
[4:41:58] <BillieNoMates> Just hit her with the bat Cloud
[4:42:00] <FauxGateau> Barrett put on the dress already.
[4:42:06] <BillieNoMates> Like that special service operative
[4:42:06] <terminusterminal> Where did all this stuff come from anyways?
[4:42:08] <Trinity5> of all the things they decided to "flesh out" LUL
[4:42:08] <+caffienatedjedi> Don't bump into things? I guess this is the end of the game
[4:42:19] <BillieNoMates> I knew that was going to happen LUL
[4:42:23] <CursedNobleman> less lulls, more LUL
[4:42:23] <FauxGateau> sick loading screen guys
[4:42:29] <tonfirean> What if he just wanted to piss
[4:42:33] <terminusterminal> That was instant
[4:42:35] <Explodincatz> every time that bucket
[4:42:36] <Trinity5> kicked a bucket
[4:42:37] <BillieNoMates> theres a tin on the floor right infront of you
[4:42:37] <badfaithmaxter> Why isn't this segment a first-person Resident Evil 7 bit?
[4:42:40] <+ArmoredTeeth> She is just waiting by the door, fully dressed
[4:42:47] <+Neoripo> A bucket
[4:42:55] <+EpicureanIguana> is she literally standing by her door wtf
[4:43:12] <FauxGateau> That tiny red bucket destroyed her peace

[4:43:16] <+ArmoredTeeth> Stealth
[4:43:18] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Plague took A step
[4:43:22] <badfaithmaxter> "Damn b, you live like this?"
[4:43:26] <+Punishedkaiger> Who leaves their house this messy?
[4:43:30] <$studleydoorite> there's gonna be a laser trap down the stairs
[4:43:31] <Trinity5> LOL
[4:43:32] <@Nightbot> @RAAAAAINMAKER -> Justice delivered! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[4:43:33] <FauxGateau> Under the pizza
[4:43:35] <+EpicureanIguana> clean up your house god damn DansGame
[4:43:35] <tonfirean> It makes sense, they want you to see the scene at least once.
[4:43:36] <%JJCheeker> this is ridiculous
[4:43:37] <terminusterminal> OH NOOOOO
[4:43:37] <BillieNoMates> She's watching you
[4:43:37] <TonberryLives> Jesus who just leaves overturned buckets in the middle of the floor?

[4:44:14] <Trinity5> HAH THEY REMOVE SHIT FOR FUCKIGN UP
[4:44:17] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yes dear
[4:44:18] <badfaithmaxter> They should have time ghosts show up if you decide to just stay there
[4:44:18] <BillieNoMates> Its all gone
[4:44:20] <+ArmoredTeeth> She's probably pressing her ear against the door
[4:44:20] <%CyberDingus> "I want you to sleep in that room Cloud, do it!"
[4:44:23] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> easier
[4:44:24] <Explodincatz> easy mode unlocked
[4:44:24] <TonberryLives> Wow
[4:44:25] <Trinity5> it makes it easier
[4:44:25] <Gavaline> Easier
[4:44:26] <fluffy_sauce> it made it easier
[4:44:32] <+caffienatedjedi> EZ mode unlocked
[4:44:32] <%JailShmixRemix> Easy mode!
[4:44:33] <BillieNoMates> It removed it as an IQ adjustment
[4:44:33] <+Neoripo> Game gave up
[4:44:35] <karl_rex> easy mode is unlocked
[4:44:38] <FauxGateau> Epic forced cutscene
[4:44:50] <$studleydoorite> it's great when games teach you to be better then take away the opportunity to do so
[4:44:53] <FauxGateau> I'll talk to earth if i want
[4:45:06] <Trinity5> "the cetra line must continue, cloud"
[4:45:08] <Explodincatz> whos Zack?
[4:45:15] <FauxGateau> You mean Zach
[4:45:16] <badfaithmaxter> Elmyra wanted Cloud out of there, so she picked up all that trash and moved it out of his way
[4:45:36] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Cloud sucks, Mom knows whats up
[4:45:39] <FauxGateau> Just go for the mom cloud
[4:45:47] <+ArmoredTeeth> A time ghost is holding her at gunpoint
[4:45:59] <Gavaline> It's ok - maybe the time ghosts can bring Zack back for a haunted threeway outside of time
[4:46:01] <+caffienatedjedi> If she were a genius, she'd wholeheartedly endorse it and get way too excited and then Aerith would be like "eww gross, Cloud is a loser"
[4:46:19] <tonfirean> That's a high-risk move
[4:46:19] <FauxGateau> Cloud is probably a loser and most likely smells
[4:46:20] <@Nightbot> @jbrachob -> Sometimes you scare me! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[4:46:20] <dmdyne99> Was Aerith‚Äôs mom named in the original?
[4:46:21] <TheWe4pon> you mean things that the director didnt touch are faithfull?
[4:46:21] <%JJCheeker> "Don't worry lady I will use mother nature's birth control... anal"
[4:46:43] <+Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes This is not Hildibrand Fantasy 7
[4:46:45] <BillieNoMates> Talks about dick flattening and then talks about hunger
[4:46:50] <BillieNoMates> That's a worrying step
[4:47:01] <TonberryLives> @TheWe4pon Exactly!
[4:47:03] <+ArmoredTeeth> A worrying flash step
[4:47:13] <Trinity5> aerith was a soul reaper the whole time
[4:47:23] <+Neoripo> ye
[4:47:24] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Which girl is the most likely to dick flatten Cloud? And why is it Yuffie?
[4:47:25] <tonfirean> Is she gonna push him back to the room again
[4:47:30] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I'd be terrified
[4:47:33] <badfaithmaxter> The time ghosts brought Aeris outside
[4:47:37] <+EpicureanIguana> did she teleport?
[4:47:40] <FauxGateau> how? use that power you tool when some jobber sneaks up on you
[4:47:40] <tonfirean> Also, he *just* promised not to talk to her
[4:47:42] <Trinity5> "because i'm trying to bone, cloud"
[4:47:43] <+caffienatedjedi> She is a bit Yandere this time around
[4:47:47] <dmdyne99> Wall Market time. Wall Street meets Walmart
[4:47:55] <Gavaline> Oh boy, Nomura time
[4:47:56] <%JailShmixRemix> Man tear
[4:47:59] <Murphio_GS> He cry
[4:48:00] <FauxGateau> Oh no... meta narratives
[4:48:02] <%CyberDingus> "Because I have plans for your penis, silly!"
[4:48:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Think about his boyfriend
[4:48:17] <Gavaline> Dilly dally my shilly shally big boy
[4:48:24] <+caffienatedjedi> When in doubt, its Ghosts or Jenova cells
[4:48:38] <+EpicureanIguana> the Nomura headache
[4:48:39] <dmdyne99> He‚Äôs getting hit by invisible dementors again
[4:48:43] <+Neoripo> Aerith's theme played and Cloud shed a tear
[4:48:50] <badbadverybad0> Real men keep their feelings inside till they die, good job cloud
[4:48:51] <CrowbarFacelift> that was a final fanfiction moment
[4:48:51] <+KusoDM> Hi Plague
[4:49:06] <$studleydoorite> what are the plates for?
[4:49:11] <+sal00nn> Nice weapon, you crazy guy
[4:49:35] <+KusoDM> Wow, Plague in person, I should watch this some other time
[4:49:48] <+caffienatedjedi> The plates are for rich people to live on
[4:49:53] <FauxGateau> Tifa actually encourages it because you're her one connection to her past.
[4:49:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It's ok to be pretty cloud
[4:49:58] <CrowbarFacelift> LUL
[4:50:01] <MKUltima> Form a giant ghost arm and just suplex you into the life stream
[4:50:05] <tonfirean> cute rats
[4:50:13] <+SunnyRmuffins> do it
[4:50:14] <+Neoripo> Timeghosts are very angry
[4:50:14] <Johnmaddened> break his legs! LUL
[4:50:15] <OldDarkwraith> Damn time jannies
[4:50:17] <+MrWrann> He must be edgier
[4:50:22] <FauxGateau> He should fight the ghost of AC cloud to over come himself
[4:50:26] <BillieNoMates> "What do you mean Aerith isn't dead? Fetch me the sword"
[4:50:34] <Trinity5> oh god this plague voice
[4:50:35] <Gavaline> Will time ghosts make Vincent hang out near Lucretia's crystal and cry for years too?
[4:50:36] <Trinity5> lmao
[4:50:42] <MilkingEdge> my precious
[4:50:45] <badfaithmaxter> The changebad ghosts are going to force that slap fight, aren't they?
[4:50:50] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> you remind me of ba'gamnan
[4:50:51] <FauxGateau> It retroactively makes deep ground exist in this game
[4:50:56] <+sal00nn> Whorehouses
[4:50:58] <arkv01> vincents gonna go shinji "I'm so fucked up" ikari on lucrecia's crysta;
[4:50:59] <+sal00nn> You know
[4:51:02] <%JJCheeker> Break them on the wheel
[4:51:03] <EuropanLamprey> If you told a Time Jannie it's very existence was breaking canon, would it blow up?
[4:51:14] <karl_rex> I still can't believe they let the guy who wrote the FFX2.5 novel work on this
[4:51:23] <+sal00nn> How Walmart begin
[4:51:24] <FauxGateau> Dude that's based
[4:51:26] <arkv01> kowloon walled city?
[4:51:30] <+0ni0n_L0rd> "The works"
[4:51:37] <Trinity5> wait so it's NOT a play on walmart?
[4:51:42] <FauxGateau> It's like a pizza rotting the life out of it's citizens...
[4:51:43] <GeltonZ> Kowloon Wal-Maryed City you mean :V
[4:51:49] <GeltonZ> YAY TYPOS
[4:51:50] <Huntercd> What't the point of a red light district if Shinra can't tax them?
[4:51:58] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Fuck fun let's go trapes around in a sewer
[4:52:01] <dmdyne99> Wall Market. The debauchery of Wall Street meets the classiness of Walmart
[4:52:10] <vonmaultke> No crossdressing yet plague LUL
[4:52:11] <GeltonZ> Time Ghosts VS Invisible Wall
[4:52:13] <+Neoripo> Ghosts are at the ready
[4:52:24] <Gavaline> Gameplay lock routes vs time ghosts - the true final boss fight
[4:52:27] <BillieNoMates> See, if Nomura made it so you COULD follow canon and the time ghost jannies were a thing that happened if you DIDNT then it'd be better
[4:52:27] <+SunnyRmuffins> alkKayo 5 games later
[4:52:39] <BillieNoMates> But because it's Nomura and not Yoko Taro, that shit would never happen
[4:53:04] <dmdyne99> Wouldn‚Äôt a better nail bay have the pointy nail ends facing out?
[4:53:09] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes There's a part here where she call you to look at something, go to her instead of going down a ladder, ladder is progress
[4:53:12] <dmdyne99> Bat*
[4:53:14] <Trinity5> @dmdyne99 yes, it would
[4:53:22] <+Neoripo> he said 6
[4:53:22] <FauxGateau> Not necessarily
[4:53:29] <CursedNobleman> huhhm
[4:53:29] <Explodincatz> speedrunners cheat so it doesnt count
[4:53:45] <+Neoripo> but yeah, speedrunning it's a breeze
[4:53:47] <CursedNobleman> 50ish hours
[4:53:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> You know what would have been sick? If they mad this whole ghost shit optional. Like you could go through the game and do the story normal, or you can change things and fight the time ghosts.
[4:53:52] <CursedNobleman> 40-50
[4:53:54] <FauxGateau> Yo this song slapps
[4:54:07] <+caffienatedjedi> any% world record is 7 hours as far as I know.
[4:54:08] <+sal00nn> Run fast
[4:54:10] <tolloponik> I got to the last fight of midgar in 2 hours of my playtime
[4:54:11] <+Neoripo> I love it
[4:54:16] <+caffienatedjedi> So Midgar would go by super fast
[4:54:17] <KaiserMario> LUL Pat loved that
[4:54:19] <+sal00nn> Love counter
[4:54:46] <Xenioplate> Hi, I've never played FF7. What the fuck is happening?
[4:54:49] <+caffienatedjedi> Oh wait, PC world record is 2hrs and 30 miunutes. That version of FF7 is busted
[4:54:54] <+SunnyRmuffins> random battles what is this a rgp ?
[4:55:30] <+pheblorganzardo> mmmmm those excessive character switch lines
[4:55:32] <+Neoripo> They are sidestepping the red district by using a destroyed and infested with monsters highway
[4:55:34] <+pheblorganzardo> gotta love it
[4:55:53] <KaiserMario> @Xenioplate Have you been watching Plague streaming?
[4:56:08] <+EpicureanIguana> obnoxious bag of sound, i mean eerit
[4:56:16] <+aspirationdeath> @xenioplate this is like 20 hours into the game a d you want a 'the story so far'?
[4:56:17] <Xenioplate> I just got here lmao
[4:56:39] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Wait man, there's a chest up there
[4:56:45] <+0ni0n_L0rd> You love the gap moe?
[4:56:46] <Xenioplate> I'm fucking around. I'll watch the Pat VOD later
[4:56:54] <Gavaline> @Xenioplate Plot ghosts and bad direction driven by milking fans in a "clap because I recognize it" culture is happening.
[4:57:13] <dmdyne99> Crush aerith with giant hand
[4:57:21] <BillieNoMates> I expect 1/3rd Midgar, 1/3rd building upto Northern Crater and Cloud falling into the Mountain Dew stream
[4:57:25] <+caffienatedjedi> Maybe they will pull a Hobbit and turn 3 games into 9.
[4:57:27] <BillieNoMates> then 1/3rd the rest
[4:57:41] <+Neoripo> come on man, it's not that bad if you ignore the time ghosts
[4:57:45] <vonmaultke> Or she could just walk up the arm Jebaited
[4:57:50] <terminusterminal> What's all this rotate stuff mean
[4:57:54] <+MrWrann> Drop her
[4:57:59] <jbrachob> CRUSH HER
[4:58:04] <dmdyne99> Drop it on her
[4:58:04] <+SunnyRmuffins> ff7 x7 monkaS
[4:58:15] <BillieNoMates> Giant Wutai robot fights
[4:58:19] <+StreamStopA> If there was only someone here that could jump 20 ft in the air
[4:58:28] <+EpicureanIguana> You think so? It's the premise of what is to come because of those time ghosts that makes me shudder
[4:58:32] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Did you rike it?
[4:58:43] <+Neoripo> It was a button
[4:58:45] <terminusterminal> Wow this is hyper linear
[4:58:48] <vonmaultke> deny her
[4:58:53] <sosandstorm> oof, left hanging
[4:59:00] <+Neoripo> God dammit Cloud!
[4:59:06] <FauxGateau> "would zach high five?"
[4:59:16] <Trinity5> i've read that doujin
[4:59:26] <+StreamStopA> I'd smash that
[4:59:26] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> He's either just a asshole or autistic
[4:59:29] <soljacko> aeris got that smash bros void snatch
[4:59:35] <+ClericOfSparda> Cloud is a Himbo, only less polite
[4:59:37] <Gavaline> "It's not that bad if you ignore the fundamental story additions we focus on in the first game, meaning things will only get worse from here"
[4:59:37] <+Neoripo> High five her with the robot arm
[4:59:43] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Is she "your type"?
[5:00:00] <vonmaultke> There better be a hell house in here
[5:00:03] <KaiserMario> Oh look! it's ED-209!
[5:00:08] <FauxGateau> I think that's just straight up magitek armor
[5:00:10] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No! She have full modeled pantsu underneath! I know Nomura wouldn't let me down!.
[5:00:26] <soljacko> fraid not
[5:00:34] <soljacko> nomua has failed you
[5:00:38] <BillieNoMates> FUNKY
[5:00:40] <+Neoripo> And in the bronx it got stronger
[5:00:47] <FauxGateau> My faith was misplaced once again.
[5:00:49] <+StreamStopA> "Should we turn them off first"..."no"
[5:00:50] <%JailShmixRemix> This is a good song
[5:00:53] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> A walking duel machine gun... throw it away
[5:01:18] <TheWe4pon> this song is bumpin
[5:01:23] <terminusterminal> This bat seems to have a complete different punisher mode attack
[5:01:24] <Trinity5> he's zoomin away
[5:01:31] <+caffienatedjedi> So this prototype seems way better than the base production model and they just chucked it in the dump
[5:01:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Man it feels like half the enemies in this game are weak to electisisity
[5:01:37] <KaiserMario> "Put your guns down and surrender! You have 10 seconds to comply!"
[5:01:38] <+Neoripo> I suppose a sweeper is kind of a magitek armor but automated
[5:01:55] <Trinity5> lol get stomped
[5:01:57] <BillieNoMates> Cloud just got stepped on by someone other than his flashback mother
[5:01:57] <Trinity5> jesus
[5:02:01] <BillieNoMates> He's upset
[5:02:11] <Trinity5> cloud just got his balls flattened
[5:02:31] <BillieNoMates> Cactuars always a best
[5:02:32] <Trinity5> fuckin love cactuars
[5:02:57] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Machines electricity, Soliders Fire, Fiends Ice and Winged Fiends Wind is the usual breakdown
[5:03:00] <+MrWrann> Where does she put the staff
[5:03:09] <%JailShmixRemix> Where else
[5:03:12] <+SunnyRmuffins> @mrwrann, alkDMCA
[5:03:16] <dmdyne99> In her dark void
[5:03:25] <+caffienatedjedi> Gotta zap carry your magic staff
[5:03:28] <Trinity5> its a collapsible staff, but not like a good one
[5:03:33] <Trinity5> one you'd find on r/mallninjashit
[5:03:38] <Xenioplate> Final Hallway 7
[5:04:11] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> You can chain potions by holding L1 when using them
[5:04:31] <Explodincatz> u can hold L1 when using a pot outside of battle to spam heal
[5:04:33] <KaiserMario> "NOT CANON! Fetch the woman! Gouge her eyes out and flay her in front of him! Make him MORE depressed! Shoot his dog too!"
[5:04:41] <terminusterminal> Is she equipping the silver staff?
[5:06:22] <tonfirean> I read that as "Needs More Malaria"
[5:06:31] <Xenioplate> DUAL WIELD
[5:07:35] <+caffienatedjedi> That was the whole reason you grinded that box minigame, wasn't it?
[5:07:38] <Trinity5> spectral cogwheel i think was a whack a box reward
[5:08:50] <+Neoripo> Still no ALL materia
[5:09:06] <KaiserMario> I like Eli's frowny face when he's thinking hard, you can almost see the rusty cogs turning
[5:09:31] <+Neoripo> The punk build
[5:10:46] <dmdyne99> Is this where hellhouse is supposed to spawn?
[5:11:38] <%JailShmixRemix> Aerith is the yamcha of the group
[5:11:47] <+Neoripo> in the original? yes
[5:12:48] <terminusterminal> Maybe she can use "Blood is Power"
[5:12:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:13:22] <terminusterminal> Is regen worth using?
[5:13:37] <arkv01> yeah pray eventually just summons The Flood
[5:13:52] <+pheblorganzardo> i would watch a grind stream
[5:14:02] <+sal00nn> I'd watch you grind
[5:14:09] <arkv01> I would also enjoy plagueofgrind
[5:14:31] <arkv01> just chill stream and do whatever
[5:14:40] <MilkingEdge> GrindOfGripes
[5:15:10] <Trinity5> plagueofgrind just throws on michael jackson music and turns off the facecam
[5:15:23] <%JailShmixRemix> GrindingGripes
[5:15:43] <+Neoripo> designated mage
[5:15:45] <BillieNoMates> Yeah. Thats her shtick
[5:15:49] <BillieNoMates> Shes the mage
[5:16:01] <BillieNoMates> I dont think any other character was in 7.
[5:16:38] <arkv01> the giant robot arm begs the question why shinra discarded their armored core program
[5:16:54] <arkv01> cloud PLEASE
[5:16:54] <+caffienatedjedi> I really want to know why they have to give it articulated fingers. Just give it a bucket and pincers, yeesh.
[5:17:00] <Trinity5> cloud cmon bro
[5:17:03] <+Neoripo> Come ooooon!
[5:17:07] <%JailShmixRemix> Clouds really a dork
[5:17:13] <dmdyne99> So awkward
[5:17:14] <arkv01> lucky for me, you'll be my snowboard!
[5:17:15] <+Neoripo> Use hand Cloud!
[5:17:20] <BillieNoMates> Cloud can literally leap 30m in the air
[5:17:22] <TonberryLives> Wow
[5:17:25] <T_Sasquatch> youre making me hungry
[5:17:28] <+ThePhasingOctopus> coud is such a dork
[5:17:29] <+caffienatedjedi> Y'know, they call them fingers but I've never seen them fing. Whoaaaah
[5:17:31] <Gavaline> So are these arms the set up for new Shinra weapons superbosses?
[5:17:33] <Trinity5> "aerith what if your hands had hands"
[5:17:40] <arkv01> I imagine proud clod failures?
[5:17:48] <arkv01> proud clods gonna be huuuuge
[5:17:50] <@Nightbot> @BrachyZoid -> I'm only trying to help. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[5:18:00] <+Neoripo> She can get items
[5:18:06] <BrachyZoid> spamming symbols? oh, too many dots
[5:18:10] <BillieNoMates> When Aerith asked to be fisted, this wasn't what she meant
[5:18:11] <arkv01> or GRAB THOT
[5:18:21] <BrachyZoid> Aerith, there are just two levers
[5:18:23] <BillieNoMates> Ahjahahaha
[5:18:29] <BillieNoMates> Shake her off
[5:18:32] <+StreamStopA> shake her off
[5:18:49] <BillieNoMates> Kinky
[5:18:51] <BrachyZoid> accidental crush
[5:18:58] <CursedNobleman> what are we doing now? LUL
[5:19:00] <MKUltima> It unsettles me how the hand just bends back and forth.
[5:19:00] <Shwepie> Because you aren't a good girl.
[5:19:01] <fluffy_sauce> squish her!
[5:19:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Look at this contrived filler
[5:19:07] <terminusterminal> Does binding count as elemental for your attacks? Can you have binding attacks?
[5:19:13] <Gavaline> Because Cloud is a bad girl
[5:19:19] <BrachyZoid> pffff
[5:19:19] <arkv01> LUL
[5:19:20] <%JailShmixRemix> Perfect controls
[5:19:23] <FauxGateau> this is some high tier padding i must admit
[5:19:27] <%CyberDingus> fun ride!
[5:19:28] <MilkingEdge> shake it baby
[5:19:30] <arkv01> well duh JUMP aeris
[5:19:42] <BrachyZoid> She fetch
[5:20:09] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah the materia in the church, the chest in Aerith's room
[5:20:12] <BrachyZoid> tutorial one, so maybe just one
[5:20:13] <sosandstorm> what timing
[5:20:15] <BrachyZoid> pffff
[5:20:17] <arkv01> that goddamn materia at the church you can't get right now is the biggest cockblock so far
[5:20:34] <terminusterminal> So what does binding even do?
[5:20:35] <TimetodiveLTX> probably some loading jank
[5:20:36] <KaiserMario> This is it Plague, fllow her
[5:20:44] <FauxGateau> okay nvm on the music this shit is grinding.
[5:20:50] <+Neoripo> TBH, people like Woolie could get super lost super easy
[5:20:57] <BillieNoMates> Its an option for Cloud
[5:21:02] <MilkingEdge> YAWWWNNN
[5:21:06] <BillieNoMates> Just not your frail ass
[5:21:27] <arkv01> this remix is... a lil off
[5:21:32] <TheWe4pon> wow, they ruined it
[5:21:38] <arkv01> yeah, original has more impact
[5:21:45] <arkv01> dunno might be nostalgia ears
[5:21:59] <Trinity5> the real folk blues of cosmo canyon
[5:22:01] <TimetodiveLTX> jazz bands dont go to nevada
[5:22:50] <+ThisRebelLion> @TimetodiveLTX is that a statement or a threat?
[5:23:02] <Trinity5> it might be a warning
[5:23:09] <arkv01> high winds huh
[5:23:12] <+ThisRebelLion> lol
[5:24:51] <+Neoripo> she was flat
[5:24:52] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Those are B's tops bro
[5:24:56] <Gavaline> Man, this section is really dragging on
[5:25:01] <Trinity5> LUL
[5:25:06] <TheWe4pon> cant wait for this to come to PC so people can rip the models out of the game.
[5:25:07] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Don't you think it's kinda dumb that there are these containers and ladders when Cloud can just clear 10m with a jump?
[5:25:17] <Sol_Install> I agree, as an assman
[5:25:24] <Sol_Install> minus the last part
[5:25:28] <%CyberDingus> did someone say ASS?
[5:25:29] <CursedNobleman> O_O
[5:25:30] <terminusterminal> Is Tifa vs Aerith tits vs ass?
[5:25:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Tifa has her tifas and She's got her ass
[5:25:36] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Yeah!
[5:25:38] <+sal00nn> Yup, need to balance Tifa
[5:25:44] <+0ni0n_L0rd> And Yuffie has her personality
[5:25:47] <CursedNobleman> tifa also has LEGS
[5:25:54] <CursedNobleman> Yuffie has personality? LUL
[5:26:00] <+sal00nn> The age old question
[5:26:00] <arkv01> squenix knows we live in the era of thighs
[5:26:01] <+ThisRebelLion> im guessing it's some "purity" thing... But there's nothing wrong with having a giant ass!
[5:26:03] <Gavaline> Then what is best girl Barrett? Answer: Guns
[5:26:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Fun sized!
[5:26:09] <TheWe4pon> yuffie is tummy?
[5:26:15] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Sure
[5:26:15] <+dumemoto> Aerith is much more attractive than Tifa
[5:26:16] <BillieNoMates> Yuffie has the abs
[5:26:18] <+Neoripo> That is a problem with every game
[5:26:23] <+caffienatedjedi> Still warm, as it is actively smoldering
[5:26:28] <arkv01> they made her legs a bit thicker now I think
[5:26:30] <BillieNoMates> Suddenly gang bangers
[5:26:37] <terminusterminal> Burglars? Burgling a dump?
[5:26:38] <arkv01> these fist of the north star fuckers

[5:27:07] <Gavaline> Three Stooges cameoing in FF7
[5:27:30] <terminusterminal> Okay we get the joke already
[5:27:30] <+Neoripo> Beat them
[5:27:32] <GiygasDrillBreak> Butch might be Arin Hanson
[5:27:36] <+sal00nn> Yeah
[5:27:45] <+ATorL> I want to know what the point of a... shirt like that is. It just covers his upper back and arms. It wouldn't keep you warm at all.
[5:27:46] <arkv01> we're going to give you a free colonectomy!
[5:27:46] <MilkingEdge> wreck em pants
[5:27:48] <BillieNoMates> Assess?

[5:29:31] <terminusterminal> Yo what's wrong with his back?
[5:29:35] <KaiserMario> That Skyrim corpse

[5:33:11] <KitsuneManami> Cant wait for PC load screens
[5:33:16] <arkv01> this music is poppin
[5:33:18] <terminusterminal> Is it techno music or is it called fucking house now?
[5:33:27] <+Solid_Stro> Music is poppin
[5:33:32] <Trinity5> honestly the more i hear this the more it grows on me
[5:33:33] <%JJCheeker> Understandable
[5:33:51] <KitsuneManami> @PlagueOfGripes does that weapon have a Batter Up skill?
[5:33:54] <Trinity5> the transition from the original version into this version from the fight prior helped a bit
[5:34:01] <+Neoripo> BTW this is an OG Wall market remix
[5:34:17] <arkv01> is this remix done in house?
[5:34:23] <Trinity5> he stole your gil and dipped
[5:34:24] <arkv01> or did they grab it from OC remix and credi them?
[5:34:27] <Sol_Install> ran off with you gil
[5:34:29] <$Rivalshotzgp> Exclusive legacy badge for being poor
[5:34:31] <arkv01> cause this does have OC remix vibes
[5:34:46] <Trinity5> yeah he did
[5:34:55] <+Solid_Stro> tovgLUL
[5:34:59] <arkv01> he stole your buster sword, advent children no longer canon
[5:35:01] <+ThePhasingOctopus> lol
[5:35:11] <XzileGaming> he did say "woohoo" before he left
[5:35:17] <$bloodyheartland> the true dark souls of video games
[5:35:26] <+SunnyRmuffins> @arkv01, if only it was that easy
[5:35:30] <arkv01> are these bandits cannibals?
[5:35:38] <+Neoripo> 119 gil stolen
[5:35:39] <Trinity5> the dark souls of video games is mildly infuriating cameras
[5:35:47] <+Solid_Stro> @arkv01 No just stupid
[5:36:05] <Trinity5> he did
[5:36:11] <+Neoripo> yes
[5:36:18] <$bloodyheartland> lol
[5:36:25] <terminusterminal> What's manaward?
[5:36:29] <+Solid_Stro> Are you expecting bandits to be honorable?
[5:36:49] <arkv01> this is the most relevant SourPls has been the entire game
[5:36:51] <+tussletoes> how you liking Nomura's time ghosts?
[5:37:10] <$bloodyheartland> man aerith's va sounds obnoxious
[5:37:32] <Trinity5> when do we get to summon chocolina from 13-2
[5:37:39] <T_Sasquatch> whens hell house
[5:37:46] <@dcn2049> every time that thing is summoned, I hate it more
[5:37:53] <+Solid_Stro> You shall die from over adorableness
[5:37:54] <arkv01> why aren't we summoning ifrit?
[5:37:54] <soljacko> hell house is coing
[5:38:01] <soljacko> and you'll hate it
[5:38:12] <sosandstorm> that thing was mad tanky
[5:38:30] <Trinity5> and then the mech god decided he no longer needed to nut, and so he cut off both hands
[5:38:37] <arkv01> oh shit I just remembered squenix owns Front Mission
[5:38:37] <+ATorL> a robotics major bad at anatomy
[5:38:40] <T_Sasquatch> ARMS PogChamp
[5:38:52] <arkv01> this tech is definitely going into a new front mission
[5:38:55] <+ArmoredTeeth> Clearly made for epic arm wrestling tournaments
[5:38:59] <T_Sasquatch> basically just cranes
[5:39:15] <+Punishedkaiger> This is a really inefficient way to move crates
[5:39:32] <$bloodyheartland> the scientists in midgar never thought to ask whether they should
[5:39:35] <Explodincatz> puzzles
[5:39:42] <GiygasDrillBreak> pat got this 1-2-3
[5:39:48] <+ArmoredTeeth> Slum tech is a bit behind plate tech
[5:39:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> dont let pat be smarter than you
[5:40:01] <arkv01> isn't all this stuff from the crashed plate?
[5:40:55] <medril07> and here comes the giant fist!
[5:41:06] <$bloodyheartland> fist her
[5:41:49] <Livelinne> plagueChirei
[5:43:10] <arkv01> you have to stack em yes
[5:43:24] <hntronium> Hey, anybody else in chat. Does Plague not have audio or is it just me? It's just me right?

[5:43:48] <+Neoripo> He's fine
[5:43:57] <+0ni0n_L0rd> It's just you
[5:43:59] <MilkingEdge> Turn up the volume
[5:44:25] <T_Sasquatch> Dragon
[5:44:26] <%JailShmixRemix> Atleast the music is good
[5:44:27] <arkv01> you know, you could control both arms and... tear aeris apart
[5:44:39] <T_Sasquatch> what a weird puzzle
[5:45:22] <$bloodyheartland> this must be where all the re3 puzzles went
[5:45:23] <arkv01> weird bounce effect
[5:46:43] <%JailShmixRemix> The music is great though
[5:46:45] <arkv01> but the music's grrreat!
[5:46:47] <T_Sasquatch> LOOOOOOOOOL
[5:46:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Nope

[5:48:06] <SupportWriter> Why not in a playthrough you give Barret all of the healing materia
[5:48:18] <arkv01> cmon barret, shoot me with your heal bullets!

[5:53:07] <arkv01> I think this is the crashed plate area
[5:53:08] <+XxBTExX> what do you expect
[5:53:09] <vonmaultke> Because who cares about the kids
[5:53:09] <+caffienatedjedi> Kids love playing in sewers
[5:53:12] <+Solid_Stro> Slums dude
[5:53:13] <@dcn2049> Because that's where children belong
[5:53:19] <+XxBTExX> im amazed there is no meat grinder under the playground
[5:53:29] <+Solid_Stro> Slumy playgrounds for slumy children
[5:53:31] <terminusterminal> Wait, the backup route is safer and we weren't gonna go there first?
[5:53:44] <vonmaultke> Tires

[5:54:57] <%CyberDingus> she dressed like an expensive hoe
[5:55:10] <arkv01> this is true, tifa can rip steel beams apart
[5:55:19] <TheWe4pon> female:"Mind Break"
[5:55:23] <VERDAXY> NTR NOOO
[5:55:32] <Huntercd> Yea but she's Cloud's hoe
[5:55:45] <sosandstorm> Make a break for it
[5:55:46] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hahahaha
[5:55:53] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Eli pls
[5:55:53] <MilkingEdge> I've seen enough Tifa hentai to know where this is going
[5:56:01] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Need to get back to Jessie
[5:56:05] <+EpicureanIguana> Am i the only one that thinks there's something inherently alien about Tifa's face? No idea what, shit's just bizarre
[5:56:19] <KaiserMario> No Plague, shut up!
[5:56:22] <+Neoripo> When you do sidequests?
[5:56:22] <Explodincatz> i doubt it?
[5:56:26] <StromkoPenguin> The game really opens up after Midga-- oh wait..
[5:56:31] <T_Sasquatch> you had your chance
[5:56:33] <gensoukaizou> LUL
[5:56:36] <KaiserMario> What do you meanyou want to play the game?
[5:56:45] <corpsegoo> you do get the oportunity to go back to areas later
[5:56:54] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes this looks like a start of a dirty hentai manga. I think Cloud ought to save Tifa before stuff happens
[5:56:55] <Trinity5> yo it's stamp]
[5:56:56] <MartiusGW> you will only go when nomura wants you to go
[5:56:57] <+caffienatedjedi> I feel like there has to be a time you can go back because they ONCE gave you a warning about making things unobtainable
[5:57:00] <arkv01> I mean to be fair there wasn't nearly as much stuff to do in the original
[5:57:38] <corpsegoo> without spoiling anything, before you go to raid the ShinRa Buyilding, you will have the oportunity to do clean up for all areas except sector 7
[5:57:42] <arkv01> in the name of the moon, I will flatten your dick!
[5:57:51] <Trinity5> aerith is zoomin
[5:57:55] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Speedy
[5:58:06] <MilkingEdge> aeris used haste
[5:58:10] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I can smell her milkers from miles away
[5:58:15] <xGeneralDOOM> smell the funk KreyGasm
[5:58:16] <arkv01> can we pet choco
[5:58:27] <Trinity5> it ain't
[5:58:36] <Trinity5> there we go
[5:58:54] <StromkoPenguin> This scene is unnecessary, they already know where she was going.
[5:58:55] <%CyberDingus> low gravel voice
[5:58:57] <london_flexing> LUL

[6:06:36] <KaiserMario> Oh look, your best friend is here!
[6:06:40] <arkv01> FUCK CHAD
[6:06:55] <MilkingEdge> Chad
[6:06:58] <StromkoPenguin> Yeah right Chadley, we know you're just working your "side job".
[6:06:59] <@dcn2049> god shut the hell up chad
[6:07:00] <+Neoripo> Stop stalking us!
[6:07:09] <arkv01> corrupt this little shit with the pleasures of the flesh
[6:07:09] <KaiserMario> Chad is getting dat shota dick wet
[6:07:14] <gensoukaizou> he's actually 190 years old
[6:07:35] <arkv01> but forreals I think chad was thrown in to sell to shotacon women in japan
[6:07:41] <arkv01> he's pressing ALL the buttons for them
[6:08:01] <terminusterminal> Can you control your party well enough to have them stand together?
[6:08:28] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes You like this more than FF15?
[6:08:34] <TheWe4pon> back out and equip ifrit @PlagueOfGripes
[6:08:35] <arkv01> finally, VR porn
[6:08:39] <Nelsukako> i would like Chad more if he was a old fat man or something like resident evil 4 marc becausa we need more of those and less pretty boys with VR
[6:08:42] <KaiserMario> YES HIT CHAD
[6:09:05] <VERDAXY> SHIVA must not fap
[6:09:09] <arkv01> yea nope not happening without a full ifrit and fire materia loadout
[6:09:30] <+Solid_Stro> Would you bang Shiva even if frostbite is a possibility?
[6:09:42] <arkv01> I only need half a second :)
[6:09:47] <Nelsukako> thats some bullshit right here
[6:10:16] <terminusterminal> Is manaward like shell? 'Cause you have access to that
[6:10:23] <+Neoripo> MAy be a creation mith
[6:10:32] <+aspirationdeath> @screamlord this shits all over 15. the sidequests in 15 are the only thing id say are maybe superior but even those arent good.
[6:10:59] <arkv01> the way summons are implemented here is what I wanted in 15
[6:11:09] <xGeneralDOOM> club is bad weapon for this
[6:11:30] <arkv01> elemental all -> fire and ifrit maybe?
[6:11:31] <+aspirationdeath> fishing is the best thing 15 had to offer
[6:11:34] <+Neoripo> yeah, bat has low attack
[6:12:11] <Nelsukako> it would be way better if you just have to do a dungeon and have a summon as a boss and than as a.....well....summon than this
[6:12:12] <Explodincatz> did both miss?
[6:12:37] <arkv01> @Nelsukako can you hear the canon hardliners screaming
[6:12:53] <arkv01> it's already waaay out of canon they get summons before leaving midgar
[6:12:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:13:31] <+Neoripo> Shhh, Time ghosts might hear you
[6:14:03] <%hgtarras> So how does this work in vr? Like at all
[6:14:07] <+aspirationdeath> @nelsukako better yes but also signicantly more work and money. saying that it would be better if they "just" did that is laughable
[6:14:33] <+Neoripo> It's brain-connected VR
[6:14:43] <arkv01> I imagine in order for cloud not to be swinging his word in reality, this VR set hooks into his brain which is super fucked up
[6:14:55] <arkv01> boy already has enough brain problems
[6:15:53] <+Neoripo> Gabe Newel was talking about Brain interfaces and how they will come sooner then we think
[6:16:51] <Nelsukako> it could be reusing some asserts, i dont know. It wouldnt be that much since this game in standard version doesnt have a lot of summons.....Anything is better than "use this vr to fight summon and won the materia"
[6:16:51] <arkv01> wow we got a some good damage in so far
[6:16:58] <+Neoripo> Which makes me very excited and VERY weary about where that technology is going
[6:17:06] <Nelsukako> *that much hard
[6:17:09] <hntronium> Is Steam doing brain interface research?
[6:17:20] <arkv01> MOMMY SHIVA Kreygasm
[6:17:47] <arkv01> was that the diamond dust?
[6:17:54] <+Neoripo> Not officially. Gabe is just following the development
[6:17:58] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[6:18:01] <KaiserMario> You could've done it with Ifrit and fire
[6:18:03] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[6:18:04] <%CyberDingus> ew
[6:18:05] <MartiusGW> i see that remake is inspired by ff13
[6:18:10] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> jesus
[6:18:10] <KaiserMario> Also use potions
[6:18:15] <%JailShmixRemix> Chad man
[6:18:18] <arkv01> donald duck ass motherfucker
[6:18:24] <%hgtarras> No weaknesses?
[6:18:41] <PiCheese> LUL
[6:18:44] <+StreamStopA> Why is there no option to kill him just like he said
[6:18:45] <arkv01> spread those legs, RIP N TEAR
[6:19:07] <terminusterminal> Does manaward block magic attacks like it's shell?
[6:19:09] <+Neoripo> Calm down Plague. Robot child is updating his registry
[6:19:15] <%hgtarras> If its vr can‚Äôt he arm you with whats needed to beat him
[6:19:16] <MilkingEdge> LUL LUL LUL
[6:19:30] <xGeneralDOOM> change bat
[6:19:35] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Why ice?
[6:19:46] <london_flexing> Change from bat
[6:20:18] <badfaithmaxter> Chat says change bat
[6:20:26] <arkv01> whats wrong with bat?
[6:20:30] <+Neoripo> If it's brain-interface VR you could just imagine yourself in a volcano and melt Shiva
[6:20:42] <%hgtarras> Whats the max level ?
[6:20:51] <arkv01> did someone say THIRD STRIKE materia
[6:21:03] <Kampler21> Did you equip fire?
[6:21:10] <xGeneralDOOM> bat its low dmg and its skill sucks agains fast target
[6:21:37] <arkv01> we absolutely need a dlc that lets us put duct tape on chad's mouth
[6:21:51] <arkv01> hollup plague you need ifrit and fire
[6:23:23] <Explodincatz> from fire
[6:23:26] <hntronium> He stunned
[6:23:29] <terminusterminal> It seem synergy makes aerith cast fire whenver you do any moves so she's been beasting on him
[6:23:58] <Explodincatz> he might need ATB as well
[6:24:10] <hntronium> Is that bar beneath her health her SS bar?
[6:24:19] <arkv01> the ATB command materia/
[6:25:42] <+aspirationdeath> is the synergy on aerith? cause then i think the inciting attack has to come from cloud no?
[6:25:56] <KaiserMario> Because you should use Ifrit
[6:26:01] <london_flexing> Ifrit?
[6:26:15] <arkv01> probably ifrit and spam summon spells yeah
[6:26:25] <terminusterminal> Soul Drain gives you a paltry 2 MP
[6:26:29] <JustoAllDay> You only got 2 MP per sould rain
[6:26:40] <JustoAllDay> Yeah basically
[6:26:52] <arkv01> that looks hella cool
[6:27:13] <hntronium> Should probably heal before she uses her special
[6:27:21] <JustoAllDay> I used Pray on Aerith to save on MP and spammed a lot of Ifrit
[6:27:24] <arkv01> oh FUCK
[6:27:34] <Nelsukako> ded
[6:27:37] <Explodincatz> cast time
[6:27:37] <KaiserMario> Animation
[6:27:51] <hntronium> Rekt
[6:28:06] <MilkingEdge> get rekt
[6:28:17] <hntronium> You should also probably use Ifrit and not Cactuar
[6:28:22] <+Neoripo> Ifrit?
[6:28:23] <arkv01> I want to poop in his mouth
[6:28:27] <arkv01> no more talking chad
[6:28:35] <mapimb> see if you can use ifrit
[6:28:37] <%hgtarras> Why not use one mega there
[6:28:48] <JustoAllDay> Yeah I haven't tried using that one
[6:29:03] <terminusterminal> It causes the character equipping it to follow up. So cloud's braver caused aeris to cast fire
[6:29:23] <hntronium> Is it supposed to be on the active member or not?
[6:29:25] <JustoAllDay> Isn't it the same as just doing it manually?
[6:29:32] <JustoAllDay> But just a bit smoother cause you dont have to do it yourself?
[6:29:34] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Chat is also telling you to use Ifrit...
[6:29:39] <+aspirationdeath> like i said. you equipped it on aerith so the initial attack needs to come from cloud?
[6:29:49] <hntronium> Might it be like auto-heal where it has to be on a non-active member?
[6:30:18] <TheWe4pon> He does work in this fight @PlagueOfGripes
[6:30:21] <JustoAllDay> Ifrit really really works
[6:30:28] <JustoAllDay> This is definitely a major boss
[6:30:29] <hntronium> Ifrit should Work
[6:30:34] <arkv01> this is major boss vibes
[6:30:35] <hntronium> I saw Pat using Ifrit
[6:30:35] <Explodincatz> ifrit works bro
[6:30:37] <+Neoripo> But this is a boss battle
[6:30:48] <JustoAllDay> Ifrit makes shiva way easier, I promise
[6:30:52] <hntronium> And he wasn't using DLC since it was a SE code
[6:31:02] <%hgtarras> Same
[6:31:27] <arkv01> ifrit is REALLY strong
[6:31:37] <hntronium> Balancing I guess
[6:31:45] <+Neoripo> Get big boy summons for big boy battles
[6:31:47] <BillieNoMates> Its because the normal summons can solo the sub bosses with their damage
[6:31:51] <JustoAllDay> I just wish there was a summon bar for every battle that just took a long time to charge
[6:31:58] <KaiserMario> They are not... Pat seems fine with it because he never wants to use them
[6:31:59] <BillieNoMates> They do 4k just on their exit attack
[6:32:02] <CursedNobleman> ARE YOU WINNIN SON~
[6:32:02] <+gutsmcbutts> to battle....nake women
[6:32:16] <arkv01> yeah mommy shiva's gotta pay the bills... to chadley
[6:32:22] <+Suplexsenpai> Suplexsenpai subscribed at Tier 1. 
[6:32:32] <+wolfregis> Because reasons.
[6:32:44] <hntronium> So you can't just wail on her
[6:32:54] <whirly25> She‚Äôs Aqua
[6:33:08] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:33:12] <JustoAllDay> Huh
[6:33:15] <JustoAllDay> That's stupid
[6:33:16] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes the person with the materia needs to be the AI
[6:33:16] <terminusterminal> Other way around
[6:33:25] <+aspirationdeath> bruh
[6:33:27] <terminusterminal> Cloud will make aerith cast fire if he uses a move
[6:33:37] <BillieNoMates> cast fire with Cloud, not Aerith
[6:33:39] <+aspirationdeath> weve explained how it works
[6:33:44] <london_flexing> Cast as cloud initially
[6:33:44] <JustoAllDay> It's really unclear in the description how Synergy is supposed to work
[6:33:51] <gensoukaizou> this game needs ff12 gambits
[6:34:19] <JustoAllDay> I think her projectiles blocked it?
[6:34:43] <arkv01> fuck it, just summon ifrit and go hard
[6:34:50] <+Neoripo> So it's a gambit materia
[6:34:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> the AI character needs a bar of ATB and MP, and only casts the first level of the spell. it's still a bad materia
[6:34:52] <JustoAllDay> Gotta stagger her first
[6:35:02] <whirly25> Is aerith also virtual here? There was only one goggles
[6:35:32] <badfaithmaxter> These shit is more complicated than it needs to be.
[6:35:37] <badfaithmaxter> *this
[6:35:40] <Sokumotanaka> @whirly25 You're super overthinking it
[6:35:51] <KaiserMario> Wait, don't the two of them need the synergy materia equipped?
[6:36:04] <arkv01> I like to imagine aeris is doing all kinds of stuff to cloud's defenseless, prone body right now
[6:36:15] <arkv01> BIG BOY
[6:36:24] <%Suplexsenpai> There he is
[6:36:29] <terminusterminal> We saw it work already. Cloud used braver while under control and Aeris followed up.
[6:36:35] <whirly25> I want to battle vr aerith and summon her
[6:36:39] <KaiserMario> No I hink I'm thinking of somthing else...
[6:37:07] <arkv01> use clouds atb on ifrit spells
[6:37:08] <JustoAllDay> Sorcerer Storm is great damage
[6:37:13] <KaiserMario> Make sure to use Ifrit's skills too...
[6:37:25] <+aspirationdeath> it works like the ai commands in ff12. you equip the materia to the ai you want to do the synergistic command
[6:37:28] <arkv01> damn its sick to see the summons fighting
[6:37:53] <%squatting_eagle> good evening
[6:37:53] <whirly25> This is just like my sharkboy and lavagirl roleswap fanfiction
[6:37:55] <arkv01> here comes ifrits dunk
[6:38:13] <arkv01> damn ifrit, that's illegal
[6:38:14] <hntronium> But wasn't sharky a water type and not an ice type?
[6:38:21] <JustoAllDay> First try
[6:38:27] <terminusterminal> Fuck off chadley
[6:38:35] <JustoAllDay> It does not
[6:38:40] <JustoAllDay> It only uses up your ATB gauge
[6:38:41] <hntronium> Nope
[6:38:43] <+stephane3012> no it cost atb
[6:38:43] <%Suplexsenpai> Fucking chadley
[6:38:43] <BillieNoMates> No. it uses your ATB
[6:38:44] <JustoAllDay> It doens't reduce the summon timer
[6:38:45] <hntronium> What he said
[6:38:46] <arkv01> shut the fuck up chadley, I know you had the shiva materia the entire time there's no 'completing' bullshit here
[6:38:46] <terminusterminal> Summon abilities are about 20 to 30 times more powerful than his normal attacks
[6:39:15] <+Neoripo> It's a gambit materia
[6:39:20] <hntronium> Maybe we'll find out on youtube in a couple weeks
[6:39:25] <+theobble> Tifa looks like an alien... and I love it.
[6:39:26] <+0ni0n_L0rd> *Smash cut to synergy materia being the most useful materia in the game."
[6:39:30] <+theobble> Alien porn is my fetish
[6:39:33] <arkv01> this is the "unclear gambit" materia
[6:39:43] <terminusterminal> You used it correctly by accident but it still sucks so good riddance.
[6:39:49] <ahaegotrigger> Oil
[6:39:51] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Magnify cure
[6:39:52] <+theobble> God I want a sexy alien like Tifa to crush my dick.
[6:39:52] <hntronium> Fire
[6:39:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Ice
[6:39:56] <+theobble> Tifa...
[6:39:57] <JustoAllDay> It's not weak to anything
[6:39:57] <BillieNoMates> Exercise
[6:39:57] <arkv01> can we summon mommy shiva for non-combat needs CorgiDerp
[6:39:58] <@dcn2049> Diabetes
[6:40:01] <Explodincatz> a cleaver
[6:40:01] <JustoAllDay> Wait, cure + magnify works?
[6:40:02] <+theobble> Please beam up my balls
[6:40:02] <+hoarsloth> cardio
[6:40:02] <CursedNobleman> whew, almost forgot about KK slider LUL
[6:40:05] <hntronium> I cook chicken with fire
[6:40:06] <arkv01> feed fat chocobo butterfingers
[6:40:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I don't know for sure but tha's my guess
[6:40:09] <JustoAllDay> Is there a max range for it?
[6:40:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> Synergy got pre-emptively nerfed because it probably used to have no MP cost or triggered on regular attacks
[6:40:17] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Birds hate the cold
[6:40:31] <JustoAllDay> I only use magnify for my offensive spells
[6:40:33] <%Suplexsenpai> Maybe :)
[6:40:44] <+aspirationdeath> synergy is kinda redundant anyway if youre actively playing all your party
[6:40:46] <arkv01> summon big brain choco chick and make fatty die from pity

[6:57:17] <hntronium> I was answering someone's question
[6:57:28] <$Rivalshotzgp> It‚Äôs like a cruise ship in regards to exploitation
[6:57:36] <hntronium> He was asking where Jessie worked

[6:59:31] <%Suplexsenpai> Good Ol fight hallway
[6:59:54] <hntronium> It's really far up
[6:59:54] <+Neoripo> You are going back to sector 5
[7:00:08] <arkv01> I like the lamps retcon, very cool
[7:00:08] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Lamps for scale
[7:00:23] <sosandstorm> this is making me nastolgic for the first DS1 playthrough
[7:00:51] <%CyberDingus> Are you sure this is the way?
[7:01:02] <+Neoripo> no
[7:01:19] <+Neoripo> he went back to Aeriths hometown
[7:01:20] <+theobble> She has a good look
[7:01:26] <+theobble> The grace jones look
[7:01:32] <%CyberDingus> Why here tho?
[7:02:03] <+Neoripo> he got lost
[7:02:18] <arkv01> it's perspective I guess, we know the OG was nowhere near this lengthy
[7:02:22] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes your back at orphange
[7:03:19] <%caramello_man> chocobo fabric softener would smell like shit lady
[7:03:25] <+Neoripo> yep
[7:03:58] <KaiserMario> I guess this is what Oney meant by "padding" huh?
[7:04:00] <+Neoripo> highway
[7:04:18] <terminusterminal> I bet it's a shitty healing materia
[7:04:25] <+NmyLogan> i love railroading
[7:04:44] <examplez0> All the way down south
[7:04:53] <TheWe4pon> dosent the missions log show you?
[7:05:16] <examplez0> The indicator on the map also shows you
[7:05:21] <arkv01> its just a shame we don't have tifa right now
[7:05:29] <KaiserMario> I'm looking foward for the 30h Plague break-down review of this
[7:05:45] <hntronium> One drugs please
[7:05:47] <cyberblueneon> probably cause it was stretched out so they could sell it in parts, not because strectching it actually made it better
[7:05:49] <+NmyLogan> one drugs please
[7:05:57] <+theobble> moon2EZ hey kids want some drugs
[7:05:58] <Apolonm> atpSuspect atpSuspect
[7:05:58] <terminusterminal> What does Binding do again?
[7:06:21] <+Neoripo> debuff for enemies
[7:06:41] <examplez0> It's like Plague said they stretched things at least five times as long as the original
[7:06:46] <KaiserMario> Blind, silence, slow...?
[7:06:57] <examplez0> To pad out the length of the game to sell it in parts
[7:07:17] <examplez0> Same thing Peter Jackson did to The Hobbit movies
[7:07:36] <Coystick> Are they waiting for him to poop?
[7:08:07] <%caramello_man> "i'll fucking murder you"
[7:08:08] <heartlesshealer> No pass. It was a lie
[7:08:17] <KaiserMario> There is a big difference in adding more context and fleshing out characters and scenes better, and then there's padding... And think this game does both, but the padding feels more prevalent
[7:08:17] <examplez0> YOU SHALL NOT PASS
[7:08:29] <ahaegotrigger> you mean you couldnt just brain him with that giant bat
[7:09:00] <heartlesshealer> oh god more trapped treasure
[7:09:00] <%Suplexsenpai> Minor
[7:09:18] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes try to talk with them again ?
[7:09:23] <%caramello_man> but you sound so friendly
[7:09:30] <examplez0> There's a big difference between adding more content and time ghosts
[7:09:35] <gnollAUS> Get mugged by a gay ally thug

[7:09:59] <gnollAUS> Ground pouding
[7:10:07] <%Suplexsenpai> Maybe for Japan
[7:10:19] <+0ni0n_L0rd> If you think that woman is fat you haven't been to a walmart

[7:16:56] <examplez0> In the original he and Tifa actually were friends
[7:17:00] <%Suplexsenpai> >.> <.<
[7:17:04] <hntronium> That was a quest?
[7:17:05] <Sokumotanaka> Johnny secret party member
[7:17:27] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes i think more areas poped up on the map
[7:17:29] <arkv01> they cranked johnny up to 11
[7:17:32] <KaiserMario> Wait, why is China here?
[7:17:35] <Livelinne> Koruneo
[7:17:36] <hntronium> Did they turn Corneo into a Yakoozi boy?
[7:17:38] <examplez0> Yes

[7:18:10] <%Suplexsenpai> Yes
[7:18:13] <examplez0> That was probably the intention
[7:18:19] <+sal00nn> Probably
[7:18:23] <xGeneralDOOM> super good
[7:18:25] <MilkingEdge> edgy
[7:18:27] <%squatting_eagle> definitely intentional
[7:18:29] <hntronium> I actually jump to wall street when I hear wall market for some reason.
[7:18:33] <@A_German_spy> 74 raiders from A_German_spy have joined!

[7:18:45] <arkv01> walmart wasn't as big in japan back in the day though
[7:18:46] <Livelinne> Probably movie references
[7:18:51] <+TopsyTurvey> spyPraise spyPraise spyPraise
[7:18:54] <heartlesshealer> sleep is a horrible status effect in this one
[7:18:56] <arkv01> I suspect it's really just a play on the kowloon walled city
[7:18:57] <+waltzqueen> hey!
[7:18:57] <EmpressMoth> spyPraise spyPraise
[7:18:59] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes Surprise!

[7:19:51] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah, something like that
[7:20:05] <EmpressMoth> @PlagueOfGripes How many emojis can we have in a single line?
[7:20:09] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes That funny comment was my crowning achievement. I'll never pull it off again.

[7:20:47] <+mistersokar> @A_German_spy What did you end at today? 14? 15?
[7:20:56] <+LordSDB> You've been staying pretty much ahead of a lot of people
[7:20:58] <@A_German_spy> @mistersokar 13 or 14. I don't even remember
[7:20:59] <hntronium> Those look a lot like shirts
[7:21:05] <Gavaline> Imagine if Chadley was there when you opened the door
[7:21:15] <examplez0> Looks like a FF15 reject
[7:21:18] <Explodincatz> dude its Pi face
[7:21:24] <+mistersokar> @A_German_spy also creeping into spoilers
[7:21:25] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo Fuck off hot guy - other hot guy
[7:21:25] <hntronium> Leslie?
[7:21:30] <terminusterminal> @PlagueOfGripes "He's gonna rape the shit outta you."
[7:22:13] <gensoukaizou> i swear leslie looks like fishing cap noctis
[7:22:14] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes Just before where you are, actually. Just got to Wall Market, and been exploring all the piss alleys
[7:22:31] <hntronium> Huh, he kind of does look like Noctis doesn't he
[7:22:55] <%CyberDingus> he is true chill.
[7:23:01] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes I've been getting sidetracked a lot, with chat and exploration
[7:23:06] <hntronium> I like how tired he sounds
[7:23:14] <examplez0> In the original there was a guy who suggest Cloud take Aeris to the don's place to make a mint
[7:23:28] <+mistersokar> @A_German_spy and you see the buildings from that hotel pciture now
[7:23:40] <%JailShmixRemix> thanks johnny
[7:23:43] <+axenred> hildebrand
[7:23:43] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Such blinding white armor on that knight
[7:23:47] <Gavaline> Hildibrand?
[7:23:50] <+Neoripo> ye
[7:23:51] <+axenred> same pose nearly
[7:24:04] <KaiserMario> And he dresses like Gladiolus
[7:24:04] <%bettysharkface> Groose...?
[7:24:06] <@A_German_spy> @mistersokar Oh, yeah, that was totally Wall Market
[7:24:34] <%CyberDingus> Plague pls go to sleep
[7:24:59] <%Suplexsenpai> Side quests :)
[7:25:02] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes Sounds like every modern Square-Enix game, eh?
[7:25:02] <examplez0> Talk to Chocobo Sam first
[7:25:09] <examplez0> There's a certain order to it
[7:25:13] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> do the other 2 first then you can talk to madam
[7:25:20] <examplez0> Sam is the first one you have to talk to
[7:25:21] <%Suplexsenpai> SIDE QUESTS :)
[7:25:23] <examplez0> I think
[7:26:01] <+theobble> I love the aesthetic of this place. Neon lights and paper lanterns I'm such a sucker for that shit.
[7:26:12] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes Yeah. Seems like a lot of Japanese games these days are hand-holdy. Funny considering how very NOT hand-holdy they used to be way back when.
[7:26:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Woman stay, Man go
[7:26:16] <%Suplexsenpai> Maybe
[7:26:21] <arkv01> I don't blame them for it though, environs are more dense and complex and players need visual handholding
[7:26:26] <Gavaline> So it's a place she belongs?
[7:26:30] <ahaegotrigger> it may not be a good idea for her to wait outside of a whorehouse either though
[7:26:32] <+whiskey_wolfe_> The word "maybe" is doing a lot of heavy-lifting in that sentence.
[7:26:36] <MilkingEdge> professional dancers
[7:26:41] <%Suplexsenpai> MAYBE
[7:26:49] <examplez0> In the original she wasn't allowed in
[7:26:54] <arkv01> time for whores PogChamp
[7:26:55] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yo you wanna fuck a bee?
[7:26:58] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes There are men working here now too
[7:27:02] <@Nightbot> @Livelinne -> Much better. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[7:27:04] <%JailShmixRemix> THERE'S HONEYBOYS!?
[7:27:06] <+theobble> They are constantly in a state of whore and not-whore at all times.
[7:27:09] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes An NPC outside says so. "Honeyboys." bitterLOL
[7:27:12] <Livelinne> üêùüêù
[7:27:12] <+theobble> Truly an anomoly of science.
[7:27:17] <+mistersokar> Aerith wants that honey
[7:27:26] <arkv01> three years motherfucker
[7:27:38] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes You mean Mukki and his butt buddies? I always thought they were clients spyShock
[7:27:55] <+Neoripo> This reception existed in the PS1 version, but it was cut
[7:27:59] <MilkingEdge> ask the orphan teacher
[7:28:02] <%CyberDingus> he sound very polite and homosexual.
[7:28:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Did you go around the back of the building?
[7:28:26] <ahaegotrigger> Kreygasm
[7:28:28] <arkv01> can she sting me with that bumble Kreygasm
[7:28:31] <@dcn2049> Yeah that'd be difficult to keep on right
[7:28:34] <%bettysharkface> They probably tape their boobs to the inside, it's a thing.
[7:28:34] <ahaegotrigger> whys that a bad thing again?
[7:28:36] <%Suplexsenpai> That‚Äôs the puppy
[7:28:36] <+theobble> She uses honey as an adhesive for her tits.
[7:28:52] <%Suplexsenpai> *point
[7:29:01] <ahaegotrigger> probably have clothes hooks to keep everything in place
[7:29:08] <@A_German_spy> @PlagueOfGripes YEEHAW
[7:29:15] <+theobble> moon2SH howdy pardner
[7:29:16] <Sokumotanaka> It's future plague
[7:29:16] <examplez0> He sounds like Eeyore
[7:29:18] <%CyberDingus> {Gravel Voice}
[7:29:33] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Imagine a cowboy having "HORSE" on the back of his jacket.
[7:29:39] <arkv01> I want that sweet corneo daddy juice!
[7:29:39] <examplez0> If Eeyore had a cajun accent

[7:30:21] <hntronium> RIGGED
[7:30:24] <examplez0> Deal or no deal
[7:30:29] <%CyberDingus> it's probably rigged
[7:30:30] <+mistersokar> @PlagueOfGripes by the way, which outfit did you choose for Tifa?
[7:30:36] <examplez0> The mature one
[7:30:37] <arkv01> instant murder perhaps?
[7:30:42] <%CyberDingus> mr Cowbow Man probably had to say "NO" so many times...
[7:30:44] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> rigged, no deal
[7:30:47] <MilkingEdge> rigged
[7:30:49] <examplez0> Which is the same one she had in the original

[7:31:09] <gensoukaizou> do the time ghosts force you to go back
[7:31:11] <arkv01> mature is canon
[7:31:17] <examplez0> She dresses like Chun-Li for the sporty one
[7:31:19] <%JailShmixRemix> Mature is my favorite
[7:31:19] <+Neoripo> That changes what she wears here
[7:31:20] <hntronium> The chun li look

[7:33:13] <arkv01> shhh soapland time
[7:33:14] <tonfirean> If you're good enough to swap out coins, you're probably good enough to just flip a real coin.
[7:33:14] <Gavaline> He just lies and didn't show them the coin - the trick coin was for show
[7:33:15] <terminusterminal> In nocturne at least
[7:33:17] <Livelinne> PixelBob

[7:43:46] <arkv01> FLASH STEP
[7:43:50] <+Neoripo> Tested
[7:43:54] <heartlesshealer> cutscene teleport, they knew
[7:43:58] <+HawkGoggles2> but other than this joke it wasn't worth it.
[7:44:03] <hntronium> Hand sex
[7:44:04] <Gavaline> A sex joke
[7:44:05] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> For the lewd scene
[7:44:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> For the coom
[7:44:08] <terminusterminal> The sex joke.
[7:44:08] <examplez0> Maybe it decides a dress
[7:44:08] <%CyberDingus> HAND SEX
[7:44:12] <%Suplexsenpai> It was to judge you
[7:44:13] <TheWe4pon> @PlagueOfGripes comes up in sidequests later
[7:44:16] <+Solid_Stro> doodInjury doodTerror
[7:44:17] <examplez0> No this does
[7:44:18] <Sokumotanaka> Her apparently
[7:44:23] <arkv01> well aeris, you could put on a sweater
[7:44:28] <TheWe4pon> As for the other consequences, this option will give you the best chance to get Madam M‚Äôs two sidequests later on in the chapter, so if it‚Äôs her you want to help, make sure you splurge and get the luxury course.
[7:44:31] <%CyberDingus> Looks comfy?
[7:44:32] <TheWe4pon> is what i read
[7:44:33] <Visored34> where is the puff puff?
[7:44:46] <+XxBTExX> "looks like shit"
[7:44:52] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Not the third one. Or first one.
[7:44:59] <examplez0> That's the one I picked
[7:45:03] <hntronium> I wanna answer 3
[7:45:08] <%Suplexsenpai> We‚Äôre fire emblem at this point
[7:45:13] <+mistersokar> though the wring answer would be correct for Cloud
[7:45:15] <%caramello_man> there are no wrong answers
[7:45:20] <sosandstorm> 3 seems like the one with the least bad outcome
[7:45:21] <examplez0> ^ exactly
[7:45:23] <hntronium> What matters is Corneo's opinion
[7:45:26] <Gavaline> It doesn't, but you have to pretend your opinion matters and be complimentary
[7:45:32] <+XxBTExX> Plague please, she will take it wrong the whole time this is a no-win question women make to fuck with your head.
[7:45:35] <TheWe4pon> 2
