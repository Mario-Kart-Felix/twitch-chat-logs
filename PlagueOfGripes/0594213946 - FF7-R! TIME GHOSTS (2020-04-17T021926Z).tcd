[0:00:58] <law240> WTF!
[0:01:02] <%bettysharkface> Heya
[0:01:02] <%caramello_man> yay!
[0:01:03] <TheWe4pon> nice
[0:01:16] <law240> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:01:19] <arran_throttle> hi papa Plague
[0:01:23] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Hello.
[0:01:24] <+Cook_4_Souls> Hey
[0:01:35] <law240> you still have hard edge?
[0:01:56] <ralphwiggum16> dude you interrupted our conversation about goblins
[0:02:14] <@DCN2049> ralph, I will time you out forever
[0:02:38] <ralphwiggum16> oh please don't sir, please don't
[0:02:42] <ralphwiggum16> I'll do anything
[0:03:03] <piggypig> hello dad
[0:03:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> plagueFace_EB Amazing
[0:03:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Egg plagueFace_EB
[0:03:47] <%JailShmixRemix> plagueGripes_TK
[0:03:54] <law240> Respect the grind
[0:04:22] <law240> You get Leviathan too?!
[0:04:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> I came I saw I praise the Lord and brake the Law
[0:04:50] <rudiciuscaesar> Yo, hi Plague, long time fan, just finally got around to catching you live.
[0:05:09] <+ErrorinBluescreen> I announced the stream on steam group : ^ )
[0:05:17] <MisterMehdic> Love the unruly bed behind you
[0:06:10] <+Punishedkaiger> Holy hell Barret got chunky
[0:06:15] <+Punishedkaiger> 10k health
[0:07:09] <$HarraceHarrison> Does the menu slowdown slow the timer too?
[0:07:23] <%caramello_man> tifa Kreygasm
[0:07:31] <kentrix11> Yeah the ghosth are kinda annoying, they should be easier to pressure if they are gonna make so much dead time.
[0:08:09] <+CrimsonDio11> @kentrix11 nice pun
[0:08:10] <%JailShmixRemix> So plague, why do you like chadley so much
[0:08:20] <%bettysharkface> Is Chadles supposed to be some kinda secret robot boy or something?
[0:08:22] <kentrix11> Oh hey you are playing much better now, that rest is working wonders.
[0:08:34] <kentrix11> @CrimsonDio11 Oh god it was a pun!
[0:08:36] <cap_bon> weren't we looking for survivors of the unimaginable atrocity that had just happened
[0:08:46] <@DCN2049> Chadley is probably some time traveling future spy asshole boy
[0:09:05] <kentrix11> They are really easy to stun with ice though, like really damn easy.
[0:09:12] <%JailShmixRemix> Chadley is a main character of some other JRPG
[0:09:33] <%bettysharkface> For real?
[0:09:56] <cap_bon> Maybe Chadley was a support character from Biggs game and they both escaped to this one
[0:10:08] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Chadley Thundercock?
[0:10:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Parrying usually makes any hard enemy easier
[0:10:14] <kentrix11> Enemies that put you to sleep are pretty annoying in general, although the headband helps there.
[0:10:19] <fruit_pie_the_magician> the good parry I mean
[0:10:21] <law240> You should grab the Mythril Blade
[0:10:29] <+CrimsonDio11> oh we just max level now?
[0:10:44] <kentrix11> .....How much did you farm?
[0:10:46] <eyezehuhh> we back baby! what did I miss from the last stream?
[0:11:05] <kentrix11> Magnify materia is the most flexible one I like it.
[0:11:16] <+ErrorinBluescreen> I never really considered builds existing in FF beyond just the character being an archetype
[0:11:53] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes did you beat the game already?
[0:12:07] <kentrix11> I hope the sequels open up the system a bit more.
[0:12:12] <@DCN2049> Yes, he beat it offscreen, because that's good twitch content
[0:12:32] <kentrix11> HP materia is pretty busted honestly.
[0:12:51] <law240> Mythril Blade should be sold in the Wal Market weapon shop
[0:13:25] <xeros720> if they don't use magic much, you might be better off using chakra or prayer
[0:14:02] <kentrix11> Some materia takes a LOT of exp so it seems worthed.
[0:14:17] <xeros720> yeah, trying to level more revival materia for my hard mode, shit takes a bunch
[0:14:56] <xeros720> barret melee can trivialize some monster encounters too, it's potent
[0:15:01] <+silvery_cricket> fuck you chuddley
[0:15:07] <+silvery_cricket> chaudly
[0:15:22] <kentrix11> I like how Chadley is just "I wanna destroy the corporative overlords"
[0:15:48] <+silvery_cricket> I hate him so much, look at how he moves his arms mocking us
[0:15:55] <itsbullzie> 4Head1000 Hay Plague what do you like about Cloud?
[0:15:58] <kentrix11> He also tells Cloud he can decapitate him if he fails.
[0:16:20] <%JailShmixRemix> CHADLEY
[0:16:27] <xeros720> yeah, 8-10
[0:16:31] <+ErrorinBluescreen> I don't like chadley's clothing
[0:16:41] <+silvery_cricket> Chadley looks like the type of kid that gets thrown out of school for sneaking into the girls bathroom.
[0:16:46] <+ErrorinBluescreen> He looks like anthro donald duck
[0:17:08] <xeros720> your character are like, level 15 tops by the time you leave midgar
[0:17:50] <dmian07> I'm guessing Aerith will be your lvl when you get her
[0:17:51] <kentrix11> Usually encounters are designed with the characters you have in mind.
[0:17:54] <xeros720> i guess chapter 9? for her challenges
[0:18:12] <xeros720> you can see available manuscripts on the chapter select too
[0:18:13] <SuperVaderMan> "I have skills!"
[0:18:34] <law240> he's a country bumpkin
[0:18:40] <StaceMcGate> Heyo
[0:18:47] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Hello, I wanted to find a medium to look at the game, and what's better than one you know.
[0:19:02] <spiritofmojave> Cloud is a total dork loser
[0:19:08] <%JailShmixRemix> Cloud is a dork
[0:19:23] <StaceMcGate> For some reason I thought Plague was ahead of Pat
[0:19:25] <fluffy_sauce> shhhhh, you're not supposed to know that this far in the story
[0:19:27] <kentrix11> Oh this fight is tough.
[0:19:38] <+Punishedkaiger> That looks a fight that lightning would be good for
[0:19:38] <itsbullzie> Cloud being a dork makes me laugh actually
[0:19:42] <xeros720> if you're all hard mode juiced, it shouldn't be hard, beat him on normal
[0:19:47] <spiritofmojave> Manaward is your friend for this one for sure
[0:20:01] <@Nightbot> @zk_nails -> You're welcome. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:20:04] <kentrix11> it also builds atb faster I think.
[0:20:10] <StaceMcGate> oh and then I see HP and realize he is on NG+ LUL
[0:20:24] <kentrix11> Holy crap you are doing a lot of damage.
[0:20:45] <law240> chi tap is great yeah
[0:20:48] <xeros720> you can beat leviathan on normal level 20-25, so you're really just clowning on him
[0:20:49] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:21:10] <rudiciuscaesar> Shit, I walked away to feed my axolotl and Plague is crushing this sea monster.
[0:21:13] <StaceMcGate> Water is not an element in this one
[0:21:25] <itsbullzie> I wish Jessie was still alive
[0:21:31] <xeros720> jeez, looking at barret's health, i thought you were on hard mode
[0:21:32] <kentrix11> They made them non-elemental so you can't just clown on them with elemental resistance.
[0:21:33] <dmian07> This is not NG+?
[0:21:44] <StaceMcGate> Which is really weird in that there is no Electric Summon
[0:21:47] <cap_bon> wait how far are we in the game I was told shit gets dumb in the last 3rd
[0:21:48] <+ErrorinBluescreen> swooping is bad
[0:21:50] <kentrix11> @dmian07 He just farmed a lot.
[0:22:04] <dmian07> @kentrix11 oh ok, thank you
[0:22:18] <+silvery_cricket> It is a problem in KHs to
[0:22:40] <kentrix11> Other characters can use magic but yeah, it's kinda boring, hopefully future range characters make it more fun.
[0:22:46] <heroicspiritavenger> Honestly, if FF7R was a real character action game, flying enemies wouldn't be a problem. However, you can't even jump
[0:23:01] <itsbullzie> A lot of Apocalyptic games are coming out this year.
[0:23:07] <dmian07> Aerial combat is the only thing I don't like about the combat
[0:23:12] <rudiciuscaesar> and if you ask me, water and ice are the same element, I hate when games separate them
[0:23:26] <+ErrorinBluescreen> I know, the hit game of the century, Skyrim 76 is now on steam
[0:23:53] <StaceMcGate> So not NG+, just grinded like crazy?
[0:23:58] <thiccguy305> first time i've ever seen your real face.
[0:23:59] <%caramello_man> @PlagueOfGripes how much time did you spend grinding in the last few days?
[0:24:11] <kentrix11> @StaceMcGate yup
[0:24:14] <cap_bon> is f76 playable now is it an actual falloutgame
[0:24:15] <+silvery_cricket> FUCK YOU CHADLEY
[0:24:23] <law240> Nice!!! he didn't do Tidal Wave!
[0:24:24] <framewindowcleaner> Shinra did nothing wrong
[0:24:30] <dmian07> @rudiciuscaesar I guess they do that because you need yo have a weakness per element, and then Water/Ice wuld be OP
[0:24:48] <+ErrorinBluescreen> f76 kind of works? It will be a mess until bethesda's studio for 76 is no longer a revolving intern door
[0:24:54] <law240> NICE!!!!
[0:24:59] <itsbullzie> Chadly is a dork too.
[0:24:59] <Futurecity10> YOOOOOO BAHAMUT?!
[0:25:01] <xeros720> haven't even fought bahamut yet myself
[0:25:08] <+ErrorinBluescreen> with Pete Heins mindlinked into the intern
[0:25:13] <StaceMcGate> I hit max level within 3 hours of NG+. the game really didn't incentivize grinding in base game
[0:25:18] <sad_toast_> sqweeenix game 😅
[0:25:20] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Why does that child look like no child has ever ever looked, ever.
[0:25:25] <itsbullzie> @xeros720 I didn't buy the game yet.
[0:25:36] <framewindowcleaner> The areas are just big corridors towars actual content
[0:25:41] <rudiciuscaesar> @dmian07 yeah, I get that. I think water could be balanced by wind though, since a hurricane just tosses the ocean onto the earth.
[0:26:05] <rudiciuscaesar> but then Shiva and Leviathan would be the same element. So they'd have to balance them differently
[0:26:13] <sad_toast_> "FF15 Wasn't a hallways" lol (throws heavy object of general direction of that guy)
[0:26:14] <xeros720> i was commenting more on him finishing all the battle intel quests
[0:26:15] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes The farming is meant to be done in post game.
[0:26:20] <+ErrorinBluescreen> I mean that was the classic complaint about 11 I believe. Was that it was too on rails.
[0:26:22] <suitangi021> What's exploration and adventure? Jokes aside if any area of the game is hallways it should be midgar
[0:26:24] <xeros720> since you need to level up at least one of every magic materia to finish
[0:26:27] <%criticalinked> criticalinked subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months, currently on a 11 month streak! Any JRPG that removes the need for grinding is okay in my book.
[0:26:35] <StaceMcGate> What areas were you going too?
[0:26:41] <+ErrorinBluescreen> FF7's style of world combat is sort of a tired system from an older era
[0:26:44] <cap_bon> How dare you try to explore the world when Nomuras work is going unappreciated
[0:26:49] <Kampler21> holy crap did you beat the game yet
[0:26:55] <xeros720> 2x but yeah
[0:27:03] <kentrix11> @Kampler21 no he just farmed a lot.
[0:27:07] <itsbullzie> is grinding XP a drag?
[0:27:12] <StaceMcGate> 2X Exp + EXP materia got me 5 levels in the first chapter alone
[0:27:21] <framewindowcleaner> FFVII random battles are actually really great, because of the way the AP system works
[0:27:24] <Kampler21> This seems like a huge oversight by the devs lmao
[0:27:34] <Kampler21> @kentrix11 ah okie
[0:27:38] <kentrix11> This game has lots of "you can't go to your menu because of this small detail" it's weird
[0:27:52] <+CrimsonDio11> you can skip it you have to mash triangle I believe @PlagueOfGripes
[0:28:24] <suitangi021> You took the materia off of Barret, didn't you?
[0:28:31] <sad_toast_> little motor mount 😅
[0:28:41] <kentrix11> I wish it would do as MGS and let you hold triangle rather than press each time, it gets tiresome on ng+
[0:28:56] <+pheblorganzardo> bamhambut
[0:29:02] <+Lonewolf2840> @PlagueOfGripes can you say 'myraid DEATHS'
[0:29:44] <sad_toast_> I Played the Beginning of of FF10 SO MANY TIMES cuz I funny have a memory card at the time ...
[0:29:49] <kentrix11> You can take advantage of that to get them into traps and leave some characters to cast big spells.
[0:29:59] <xeros720> well, it's bahamut, so hard to say
[0:30:01] <framewindowcleaner> Without a true gambit system party management sucks, so the AI needs to be dumber
[0:30:07] <sad_toast_> I hate auto correct 😞😖
[0:30:32] <xeros720> party is real good at blocking at least
[0:30:37] <kentrix11> Umbrals strike is a pain in the ass, you can't even block it, I haven't tried a parry though.
[0:30:42] <xeros720> steadfast materia feels really important
[0:30:51] <turbofolk> !uptime
[0:30:51] <@Nightbot> 31 minutes 1 second
[0:31:19] <WhatAngelMemesMe> Kinda surprised Bahamut is even in part 1.
[0:31:31] <PsychicKirby> I think, perhaps, flying enemies could be tolerable if they could be staggared to the ground to be beat up.
[0:31:48] <kentrix11> @WhatAngelMemesMe they put way more summons that what I was expecting.
[0:32:10] <pikastation> What's up everyone
[0:32:20] <kentrix11> Raise+magnify is a good choice in this fight.
[0:32:46] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I hope Alexander is cool in one of the later parts.
[0:33:00] <kentrix11> I hope knights of the round table is cool.
[0:33:02] <heroicspiritavenger> This is a VR Simulation, so why shouldn't you be allowed to have a VR Aerith
[0:33:15] <rudiciuscaesar> @WhatAngelMemesMe I wonder how the Knights will be done.
[0:33:23] <rudiciuscaesar> They will probably be a mob boss.
[0:33:24] <itsbullzie> cheerwhal5000 Hay, if FF7 doesn't have Aerith die, why not replace her with Cloud? It would be shocking why not? thought I would throw that out there.
[0:33:37] <sad_toast_> OP
[0:33:40] <framewindowcleaner> How do you even get Summon materia from a VR fight?
[0:33:51] <+CrimsonDio11> did you try assessing him to find out what he's weak to?
[0:33:59] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh yeah, Bahamut's countdown, in all the other games, results in Mega Flare. In FF8 and FF10 at least.
[0:34:09] <PsychicKirby> For those who have played, is Gravity a thing? Also how does it affect standard enemies?
[0:34:11] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I like the Knights, but Alexander is usually my favorite in FF games.
[0:34:17] <@Nightbot> @ThespianBarrage -> There's more where that came from. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[0:34:20] <kentrix11> You were using the counter from punisher, but he does go through guards with umbral strike.
[0:34:32] <sad_toast_> you gotta throw everything and the kitchen sink at this guy ... I wouldn't bother but that's me 😅
[0:34:51] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Dragon is racist
[0:34:54] <medici_san> plague did you just make a post on 4chan because if you did im glad you did
[0:35:02] <rudiciuscaesar> HOLY SHIT, was that 8,000 damage!?
[0:35:03] <itsbullzie> yeah the dragon is mad
[0:35:20] <xeros720> bad dragon
[0:35:35] <kentrix11> Hey just decapitate him, he says it was alright to do so if you didn't trust him.
[0:35:37] <rudiciuscaesar> and if memory serves me right, you cannot block it, M Barrier/Shell won't help
[0:35:39] <law240> you missing a weapon for Cloud
[0:35:40] <+silvery_cricket> Its Bahamut
[0:35:59] <xeros720> oh yeah, the weapon store is selling one in this chapter, right?
[0:36:02] <+Slaardacity> Game needs some kinda system for pulling aggro
[0:36:06] <WhatAngelMemesMe> Bahamut does look cool and that attack was pretty, but that fight looks tedious.
[0:36:06] <kentrix11> With max health barret can survive his megaflare.
[0:36:13] <law240> it's in Wall Market
[0:36:17] <turbofolk> What does pink pretty princess fight mean?
[0:36:22] <+ErrorinBluescreen> FF has kind of just become the particle effects series
[0:36:23] <rudiciuscaesar> oh and Plague, your eternal nemesis, the dargon, yes, I spelled it that way on purpose, clearly not a fun fight.
[0:36:32] <+Slaardacity> like the sentinel from ff13
[0:37:15] <%CyberDingus> Hello chat. How much did I miss?
[0:37:20] <dmian07> There are other Avalanche factions
[0:37:28] <kentrix11> Well there are other avalanche people.
[0:37:37] <+pheblorganzardo> barret is the saving grace of this lol
[0:37:44] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What is this shit on Cloud hour?
[0:37:46] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Oh this is the Suck Off The Protagonist segment?
[0:37:52] <oshkeet41> I must be getting older cause Barret's dialogue is some of my fave ones so far
[0:37:56] <sad_toast_> Cloud true so hard to be cool 😏
[0:38:01] <rudiciuscaesar> that wall looks too nice to be the one in Wall Market
[0:38:18] <rudiciuscaesar> Oh, I really like Aeris's everything. Her voice actress is so awesome.
[0:38:27] <OToole42> tee hee I'm an innocent supportive flower
[0:38:29] <OToole42> etc
[0:38:38] <rudiciuscaesar> though I feel like Square just read all the fanfiction on DeviantArt before making this.
[0:38:54] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Wait, is barett black or just really tan
[0:38:54] <rudiciuscaesar> ESPECIALLY anything to do with Aeris.
[0:38:56] <cap_bon> but what about wedge the one that likes food you know because hes fat
[0:39:00] <+pheblorganzardo> i would let barret kick my ass
[0:39:17] <OToole42> me too
[0:39:23] <kentrix11> I mean she does act more flirty and sassy, so that's nice at least.
[0:39:23] <OToole42> he's got big feet for it
[0:39:32] <+Gamingand808s> 16
[0:39:35] <KaiserMario> You know the padding of this game is bad when even Ben Moore tweeted about it...
[0:39:55] <rudiciuscaesar> this is too bright for this scene. This should be a night and the light pollution should be oppressive.
[0:39:57] <+Gamingand808s> chapter 17 is like 5 hrs long
[0:40:00] <TG_Cid11> your one the plate they dropped
[0:40:01] <WhatAngelMemesMe> So far, I like Tifa and Aerith, but I think Jessie kinda wins me over. I dunno. I'm a sucker.
[0:40:02] <itsbullzie> "Why did this have to happen." Well Shenrogh or how ever you spell it said so.
[0:40:04] <OToole42> only 40 m up
[0:40:08] <sad_toast_> like a middle Level 🤔
[0:40:23] <cap_bon> wouldnt this entire city jsut be covered in a giant cloud of smoke and asbestos probably best not to think about it
[0:40:23] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[0:40:32] <%CyberDingus> e d g e
[0:40:35] <oshkeet41> is a bit bright but im suspicious Sunset = Near an End or Getting Dark Soon
[0:41:04] <rudiciuscaesar> Man, I hope the climbing is in this.
[0:41:04] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:41:09] <%JJCheeker> hhowdy
[0:41:18] <rudiciuscaesar> that part is actually really cool and the music helps get your morale up.
[0:41:33] <itsbullzie> @nightbot speaking of art, I tried to draw Gohan the other day
[0:41:34] <+CrimsonDio11> plague are you gonna take the elevator or take the stairs? in the shinra building?
[0:41:35] <%JJCheeker> lol
[0:41:47] <rudiciuscaesar> JESUS, those enemies spawning in scared me, I wasn't ready lol.
[0:41:57] <Ekaelis> Is Barret like tge best character in the game?
[0:42:15] <OToole42> he make a surprisingly good healer
[0:42:19] <OToole42> he makes*
[0:42:29] <+silvery_cricket> This is some slapdash mass murder
[0:42:31] <rudiciuscaesar> it would be nice if Cloud would whistle the theme once in a while, like after the Mideel part, when he figures out shit.
[0:42:50] <sad_toast_> wall .... remains.. climbing .. Potatoe Tomato same thiiiiimg
[0:43:22] <rudiciuscaesar> Jules is the shit. Love that guy.
[0:43:26] <sad_toast_> I can do unlimited pull ups I swear I love doing pull ups 😁
[0:43:34] <xeros720> oh, i did too
[0:43:43] <xeros720> had to wait for him to fuck up as well
[0:43:50] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I have heard the pull up game is atrocious.
[0:43:56] <xeros720> 40? oh man, he still made it to 42
[0:44:10] <SilverRoddo> I assume Luck is worth it. HahaCat
[0:44:11] <itsbullzie> they like flying things plague
[0:44:28] <%caramello_man> why would you lock off a minigame tho?
[0:44:28] <CursedNobleman> heh, the scale really makes it seem absurd how they just climbed up to the plate in the OG
[0:44:34] <oshkeet41> Are the enemy skill in this vrsion as utterly broken as the other game, or more mild?
[0:44:38] <sad_toast_> not much ground to walk on here thus flying enemies 😏
[0:44:39] <xeros720> supposedly luck increases your crit rate and box drops
[0:44:47] <rudiciuscaesar> Luck, at least in the old games, effects critical rate, and more importantly, dodging. In original FF7, if you get your luck to 255, which is easy, you can actually dodge SOME magic attacks.
[0:44:53] <turbofolk> The more i think about it FF7R's combat is straight up kingdom hearths's
[0:44:56] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes So apparently Twitch is having issues with recent VODs today. Skipping around, missing huge chunks of time.
[0:44:57] <+CrimsonDio11> I think the one thing I'd change for the future games is for Square to add a jump button and actual ariel combos
[0:45:07] <WhatAngelMemesMe> Flying enemies wouldn't be so bad if you had all your ranged folks.
[0:45:27] <OToole42> oh barret, you card
[0:45:31] <Ace_Kuper> @PlagueOfGripes I don't know if you are doing a local recoding, but if not. There might be issues at hadn. Pat is apparently missing 90 minutes of his FF7 stream
[0:45:34] <+CrimsonDio11> @turbofolk you're wrong they are distinctly different
[0:45:48] <rudiciuscaesar> Woah, 90 minutes missing from Pat's Stream too?
[0:45:59] <sad_toast_> another streamer was like "oh twitch is just on fire everything is breaking" lokol
[0:46:07] <Owkono> yeah pats last vod is fucked
[0:46:19] <turbofolk> What do you mean is right there, the only difference is the ability to switch between party members
[0:46:28] <rudiciuscaesar> so Twitch is like modding Skyrim. Sometimes it works, other times....
[0:46:29] <+JMariaGreywall> Hello!
[0:46:38] <OToole42> poor guy lost 90 minutes of footage
[0:46:39] <+CrimsonDio11> no kh has actual stagger
[0:46:45] <+CrimsonDio11> and combo modifiers
[0:46:47] <turbofolk> ffs the combo is just one button
[0:46:55] <sad_toast_> ""it's your fault you peasants""
[0:47:01] <rudiciuscaesar> good use of douche bag, I feel that phrase fell out of use, at least in my area it did.
[0:47:02] <+CrimsonDio11> dude Im telling you the combat is different
[0:47:04] <itsbullzie> @plagueofgripes I Just Joined Twitch, I don't have any problems myself
[0:47:18] <OToole42> who cares if the combat is the same or different
[0:47:28] <OToole42> if you wanna wag your e-peens at each other take it to dms
[0:47:41] <cap_bon> game is really pushing these grappling hooks
[0:47:43] <rudiciuscaesar> like their shit works like Batman's, which is insane.
[0:47:43] <sad_toast_> grappling hooks are cool tho 😞
[0:47:51] <+Runtripfall> They must have watched Gravity Falls
[0:47:51] <kentrix11> They don't but they are cool.
[0:47:53] <turbofolk> Well how about this the FF7R's uses a modified KH combat system, the base is still there
[0:47:55] <rudiciuscaesar> OH GREAT, a flying boss with flying soldiers!
[0:48:09] <TheWe4pon> They're get out of jail free cards for the writers.
[0:48:13] <OToole42> imagine how sore those guys left shoulders are after a shift
[0:48:25] <itsbullzie> Doom Eternal? anyone?
[0:48:30] <OToole42> hope they have coverage for massages
[0:48:32] <Ashenik1> Hi chat and the best of plagues o/
[0:48:41] <cap_bon> Non stop infinite padding
[0:48:42] <+JMariaGreywall> So the first challenge run of this game is completed.
[0:48:44] <OToole42> @Ashenik1 heyo
[0:48:47] <kentrix11> @turbofolk no KH is like 80% action focuses, 7R is like..40% action, it has a more tactical focus.
[0:48:48] <sad_toast_> @itsbullzie I loved it that's about it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[0:48:57] <SilverRoddo> What, that Peridot helicopter-hand tech.
[0:49:12] <rudiciuscaesar> Woah, actual SOLDIERS, cool shit.
[0:49:14] <$jamarartdoodles> Love Nier
[0:49:21] <dmian07> Lol so these guys are supposd to be on the same level as Roche?
[0:49:33] <Ashenik1> Is this a good game for somebody who never played jRPG?
[0:49:38] <kentrix11> Somehow they don't notic the different voice
[0:49:56] <rudiciuscaesar> I love the bad guys being shitty about getting OT
[0:49:59] <sad_toast_> @silverroddo that's actually my favorite character if we're thinking about the same thing 😏
[0:50:05] <rudiciuscaesar> like they're all district managers for Target.
[0:50:12] <turbofolk> BARRET SMASH!!!
[0:50:19] <%CyberDingus> BARRET ANGERY
[0:50:45] <sad_toast_> that could added padding too!!!
[0:50:46] <itsbullzie> BARRET MAD!
[0:51:01] <+HRDSalami654> You have to attack the darkness Plague.
[0:51:10] <rudiciuscaesar> gibs?
[0:51:11] <turbofolk> Nomura really wants to make rebuild of ff7
[0:51:12] <+JMariaGreywall> I actually don't mind the differences the games done.
[0:51:15] <KessOrangeSoda> One of those older style of cars that's got a body made of steel.
[0:51:20] <%caramello_man> gibbs the opposite of biggs
[0:51:21] <$jamarartdoodles> Gibblets
[0:51:24] <Ashenik1> Since Plague is complaining about potential of the game is he enjoying it?!
[0:51:25] <+HRDSalami654> I mean, he pretty much did.
[0:51:35] <SilverRoddo> Roche is just a smurf, he is a c3 soilder in name Kappa Peridot is great, sad toast.
[0:51:40] <+HRDSalami654> I really don't get why people like Nomura so much.
[0:51:42] <+JMariaGreywall> They wanted to give Barret something to shoot at.
[0:51:45] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes shouldn't those propeller assholes spin around because they have no counter-propelling going on?
[0:51:46] <+shootbang_exe> this is what happens when you put the brainlet boys in charge of a project lol
[0:51:48] <rudiciuscaesar> I too, like the differences. I'm very satisfied, but the flying enemies need nerfed. They need to patch it so they stay closer to the ground or so that magic is more accurate.
[0:51:50] <OToole42> I hate flying enemies in these games
[0:51:53] <KessOrangeSoda> Barret's fat ass gets the party in trouble again
[0:51:56] <turbofolk> SOme people just love garbage writing
[0:51:59] <law240> you miss sword that gives cloud a long range attack
[0:52:01] <+shootbang_exe> Nomura, Nojima, Toriyama
[0:52:10] <rudiciuscaesar> like, a failure of game design was when fighting Bahamut, Cloud and Tifa just stood there, instead of throwing magic.
[0:52:13] <%Bacon_Rage> Jebaited ok
[0:52:20] <xeros720> i prefer his smackdown weapon ability
[0:52:46] <rudiciuscaesar> like see, Tifa got that dude, cuz he was at least "closer"
[0:52:47] <itsbullzie> RDR 2 has some good writing.
[0:52:50] <Ashenik1> @turbofolk has there ever been a jRPG with actualt quality writing?
[0:52:57] <SilverRoddo> They move around like Wild Arms 3 characters during battle.
[0:53:01] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar wait, you want the AI to throw magic? cause that could be troublesome i a number of ways.
[0:53:09] <OToole42> @Ashenik1 Vagrant Story
[0:53:18] <+HRDSalami654> Nomura is the master of hiding bad writing behind nonsense.
[0:53:24] <rudiciuscaesar> no, like, you should be able to switch, use the ATB, hit Thundagaa, and Cloud should do it.
[0:53:28] <rudiciuscaesar> or like a gambit from FF12.
[0:53:32] <+ErrorinBluescreen> ha ha imagine tangible code improvements instead of just visible ones
[0:53:37] <Ashenik1> RDR 2 has great writing but has a very specific slow pacing so not for everybody like The Walking Dead Season 1
[0:53:46] <BurdRightsActivist> TIME GHOSTS YEAH YEAH YEAH LEMME SEE THAT DUMB SHITTT
[0:53:50] <itsbullzie> @ashenik1 GOD OF WAR?
[0:53:57] <law240> Blade beam?
[0:54:14] <xeros720> blade beam is strong as well, but it's slow, so it's easy to whiff
[0:54:20] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar I thought you could do that? I'm sure you can just jump to their menus without even switching and tell them to do that.
[0:54:23] <turbofolk> @Ashenik1 don't know man personally i fucking love how cringy and awkward some of the writing on Super robot wars games can get
[0:54:40] <Ashenik1> @OToole42 thx will check it out some time later :3
[0:55:02] <rudiciuscaesar> @kentrix11 yeah, you can, but the target can just move out of the way, and that's not fair, if the target can just run away, force you to use resources, for 0 gain, and the target GETS a free hit
[0:55:10] <BurdRightsActivist> But pleaguuuuee, the time ghosts are SECRETLY GENIUS and represent the fans who want the remake to be 1-1! Genius Nonumbo is so smart!
[0:55:13] <SilverRoddo> This new Fallout game looks good.
[0:55:21] <OToole42> @Ashenik1 It has a neat combat system, and a decent plot, cool characters
[0:55:35] <sad_toast_> they gotta
[0:55:47] <arran_throttle> soo... its gonna be like 13?
[0:55:52] <law240> FF15 had a mix
[0:55:58] <+HRDSalami654> I would say the time ghosts probably represent SE wanting to just make a strait remake.
[0:55:59] <kentrix11> If they make it crossgen then yeah, totally.
[0:56:00] <ZE_Count> sneaky soldiers
[0:56:05] <itsbullzie> I don't like mountains unless I am on top of one.
[0:56:06] <rudiciuscaesar> FF12 was also very cooridator simulator.
[0:56:14] <rudiciuscaesar> corridor*
[0:56:14] <+HRDSalami654> Either way it's dumb.
[0:56:17] <+LordSDB> LordSDB subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:56:18] <Ashenik1> @itsbullzie yeah thats a good game with good writing but I would not say its writing is on the level of The walking dead or witcher series
[0:56:20] <+stephane3012> maybe being on ps5 will allow them to make it open world
[0:56:21] <BurdRightsActivist> To be fair, looking bak ff13 kinda had an excuse for you to be hallwayed in the first half. You were on the run afterall, but it did open up eventually.
[0:56:26] <KessOrangeSoda> Not only does Square not know how to do open world design, they don't even care to try.
[0:56:27] <TheWe4pon> aww man the over-world was one of my favorite things from older FFs
[0:56:34] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar doesn't thundaga have tracking? I'm sure it just hits the enemy even if they move, ice and wind don't though.
[0:56:43] <+ChaosAethr> theyre 3rd class so yeah
[0:56:45] <+HRDSalami654> I will say the music in this is a banger though.
[0:56:50] <sad_toast_> how long y'all think it will be before the next game ? you think they have already been working on it? .. maybe shoot for 2022 🤔
[0:56:50] <Livelinne> Hi Plague
[0:56:51] <itsbullzie> @ashenik1 what part of walking dead?
[0:56:54] <xeros720> thunder is the best since all the spells track
[0:56:56] <Ashenik1> season 1
[0:56:58] <stellaspeed10> It would be really funny if they didn't make part 2
[0:57:03] <xeros720> fire tracks as well, but it still has to travel
[0:57:04] <kentrix11> I like a lot of the music a lot.
[0:57:08] <itsbullzie> ok
[0:57:11] <ZE_Count> Music good
[0:57:12] <BurdRightsActivist> But Pleagueeeeeee mr MAX hype man said the music was amazing! What's wrong with you?
[0:57:12] <rudiciuscaesar> @kentrix11 I think Thundaga does, and is one that will, but Fire and Blizzard can be dodged easily. Like Blizzard just straight up can be moved away from before its hitbox is active.
[0:57:20] <+TQuick101> is it the jazzy covers you don't like?
[0:57:33] <+HRDSalami654> I agree.
[0:57:41] <xeros720> i'm fighting some enemies on hard, and you just block blizzards first hit, then walk away
[0:57:48] <rudiciuscaesar> The battle theme remixes are God-tier.
[0:57:48] <Kampler21> Did you know that there are alt scenes of aerith and barret talking to cloud in the flower garden at night before going to rescue aerith @PlagueOfGripes
[0:57:51] <xeros720> it's laughably easy to avoid for you and the enemies
[0:57:55] <$jamarartdoodles> I love jazz
[0:57:59] <Livelinne> It’s still by Nobuyo Uematsu?
[0:58:04] <rudiciuscaesar> and I like all the new themes in Wall Market.
[0:58:20] <rudiciuscaesar> I actually this Uematsu did do some work on this
[0:58:23] <rudiciuscaesar> actually think*
[0:58:24] <kentrix11> @Livelinne Mostly I believe, they have like 2 other people too I think.
[0:58:34] <turbofolk> Plague perosonally i would love to see you in a conversation with maximillian_dood over this game, both of you guys just have such polar opinions over this game
[0:58:38] <+CrimsonDio11> most of this of this sound track was made by the guy who did the FF13 soundtrack I believe
[0:58:40] <Livelinne> Cuz yea Nobuyo san makes weird sounds in modern days
[0:58:50] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> hi, good night
[0:58:56] <Ashenik1> Sideways is great at analyzing musci in games and movies ! @PlagueOfGripes
[0:58:56] <+HRDSalami654> It doesn't really fade into the background as it should.
[0:58:58] <itsbullzie> You know, I wish they let Aerith die, if not her then someone else, cloud be the shocking death?
[0:59:02] <kentrix11> I think it's not your taste because it's too, high pitch? noisy?
[0:59:14] <Ashenik1> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7l9chXMljpUft67vw78qw
[0:59:22] <Carloscjq> yea... the rope
[0:59:25] <+QuasartheHero> just curious what chapter are we on?
[0:59:28] <Livelinne> @kentrix11 I see...maybe there’s also remixes I guess?
[0:59:33] <mrgaster8> 15
[0:59:36] <+HRDSalami654> I don't dislike it, but it isn't "video game" music.
[0:59:38] <+QuasartheHero> thx
[0:59:47] <+HRDSalami654> It's just music stuffed into a video game.
[0:59:49] <WhatAngelMemesMe> @plagueofgripes What would you say, in your opinion, this game does right or really well? LuvUok
[0:59:53] <kentrix11> Uematsu made hollow, the theme for sector 5, it has very Uematsu guitars.
[0:59:57] <rudiciuscaesar> that AOE Bahamut had was bullshit.
[1:00:01] <Sokumotanaka> @itsbullzie shock value =/= good
[1:00:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Bahamut? More like BAD-Humut. 4Head
[1:00:20] <rudiciuscaesar> he might as well be casting constant Negative Regen.
[1:00:21] <kentrix11> I clowned on Bahamut pretty hard so I didn't quite analize it much.
[1:00:49] <KessOrangeSoda> @PlagueOfGripes What is the meaning of life?
[1:00:50] <OToole42> Boxers or briefs then?
[1:00:52] <+HRDSalami654> But what do you think, Plague!
[1:00:59] <+QuasartheHero> eh its over rated
[1:01:01] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao BOXERS OR BRIEFS, good question.
[1:01:03] <+QuasartheHero> dodWoke
[1:01:13] <suitangi021> I missed it, how was the Bahamut fight?
[1:01:16] <SomersaultJustice> thanks mom
[1:01:17] <KessOrangeSoda> @PlagueOfGripes don't call my bluff like that
[1:01:21] <rudiciuscaesar> Bahamut was bullshit.
[1:01:23] <OToole42> I bet plague is a free-ballin sort of man
[1:01:27] <BurdRightsActivist> @suitangi021 it was BADhumut 4Head
[1:01:32] <rudiciuscaesar> unfair.
[1:01:32] <itsbullzie> @sokumotanaka yeah, Cloud dying would be a shocking move
[1:01:34] <+QuasartheHero> @plagueofgripes the answer to life the univers and everything is clearly 42
[1:01:38] <rudiciuscaesar> like David Cage designed it. Jk.
[1:01:47] <kentrix11> Eh Bahamut was tricky, he gets better when you get some late game weapon skills and Aerith.
[1:01:55] <oshkeet41> Do ya think the whole obsession with tightly controlled hallways a dev thing or a bad habit of jrpg players? Ive heard people complain JP players kind of prefer handholdy stuff lately.
[1:02:05] <+silvery_cricket> What do you think they ate in the slums, smoked rat with a side of mashed possum?
[1:02:06] <Sokumotanaka> @itsbullzie Literally not what I said at all
[1:02:10] <rudiciuscaesar> I think that's a side effect of the PS3 era and beyond
[1:02:11] <suitangi021> @BurdRightsActivist Let me guess doesn't stagger and lots of interupts?
[1:02:20] <rudiciuscaesar> that games are constructed that way now.
[1:02:23] <dmian07> That is metal I don't think you can swing it
[1:02:26] <itsbullzie> @sokumotanaka what we're you trying to say?
[1:02:38] <rudiciuscaesar> look at Fallout, or Skyrim - Future Edition, and Skyrim is just Morrowind - Viking Edition.
[1:02:48] <+QuasartheHero> bitterShrug
[1:02:49] <+ErrorinBluescreen> false dificulty
[1:02:54] <turbofolk> MECHANICS
[1:02:57] <+QuasartheHero> want you to use magic?
[1:03:00] <rudiciuscaesar> though they're super open, they are just clones of themselves. Even Batman Arkham City is kinda Skyrim like.
[1:03:10] <xeros720> magic or switch characters, yeah
[1:03:12] <+stratibario> ikr the combat mechanics can get really annoying really fast
[1:03:14] <WhatAngelMemesMe> Yeah, that makes sense to me. Lol. I dunno. I guess that would turn into a grand nowhere rant.
[1:03:15] <kentrix11> You gotta use magic a lot more, they wan you using more mechanics rather than just physical melee attacks.
[1:03:23] <rudiciuscaesar> where as FF10, PS2 era and then into the PS3 era, just corridors and set pieces.
[1:03:30] <Ashenik1> What is the point of playing this game since Tifa doesnt have big anime tities? @PlagueOfGripes
[1:03:41] <xeros720> i'm still looking for a way to increase her speed stat
[1:03:42] <BurdRightsActivist> It's AIR-RITH BabyRage BabyRage BabyRage
[1:03:48] <kentrix11> Aerith nukes things with a lot of ease, her magic is absurd.
[1:03:53] <coffeecar> Sure would suck if someone used his melee weapons Hahahahahahaha
[1:03:56] <oshkeet41> It's Earl.
[1:03:58] <Sokumotanaka> Aeris has to go save herself XD
[1:04:01] <rudiciuscaesar> @Ashenik1 she assuredly have those huge yabows but that sports bra contains them.
[1:04:02] <kentrix11> Like a basic spell with her hit sso hard.
[1:04:02] <dmian07> I made Aerith super deadly
[1:04:06] <xeros720> Urf is her name
[1:04:18] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Titsa
[1:04:23] <SilverRoddo> You need to get in close, play that footies game.
[1:04:23] <turbofolk> Aerith is just your magic spam character you arent supposed to fight
[1:04:25] <Sokumotanaka> Go on?
[1:04:30] <KessOrangeSoda> Tifa's titties were an integral part of my sexuality growing up
[1:04:34] <+QuasartheHero> i mean i like em both
[1:04:40] <+TQuick101> That's all anyone liked of Tifa
[1:04:48] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes life is hard, but titty is soft
[1:04:51] <rudiciuscaesar> @KessOrangeSoda Ok, let's talk about this because FF7 is integral to a lot of sexualities lol.
[1:04:51] <+JamesCorck> So Plague, you planning on making any FF themed `pieces in the foreseeable future, or would you rather use your energy for something else?
[1:04:52] <Futurecity10> boob guys are pretty low IQ Kappa
[1:04:54] <+silvery_cricket> I like Tifa because she punchs and has HUGE TITS
[1:04:55] <kentrix11> I like how Tifa is externally confident and internally insecure, while Aerith is externally weak-looking but pretty confident and sassy.
[1:04:55] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I'm a Yuffie man.
[1:04:56] <+QuasartheHero> yuffie is the annoying one
[1:04:56] <OToole42> Cid was the only one I loved <3 best guy
[1:04:58] <SupportWriter> SHIT
[1:04:59] <rudiciuscaesar> Like, I mean that, you're so right to say that and just admit it. More power to you.
[1:05:00] <FinchBot> i like tifa's design better, but i prefer aerith's personality
[1:05:06] <suitangi021> Tifa's a cool person. the tits are a bonus
[1:05:07] <BurdRightsActivist> I don't like Aerith X Cloud, because it makes me feel bad for Zack. I don't want cloud cucking a dead man DansGame
[1:05:09] <SupportWriter> She has a potty mouth too!
[1:05:13] <turbofolk> I im gonna fucking own it i like tifa cause of her tits
[1:05:22] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah sadly tifa doesn't have much going for her as of personality
[1:05:23] <+stephane3012> very sarcastic
[1:05:33] <rudiciuscaesar> I like Aeris, cuz when Paige said it during Pat's stream "mom's are tough!"
[1:05:42] <rudiciuscaesar> shit to learn about yourself 101.
[1:05:44] <+ErrorinBluescreen> when are we getting plague ign reviews
[1:05:45] <Ninoyiya_Ryu> Barret is a treasure in this game tho'
[1:05:46] <SilverRoddo> I need a demake, and it should be about Scarlet.
[1:05:47] <Frankomancer> Barret is upset there arent any sewer rats to kill up here
[1:05:49] <+QuasartheHero> minor stuff adds up over a whole game
[1:05:56] <xeros720> aerith, despite her bubbly sounding voice, comes off really pessimistic to me
[1:05:58] <Ashenik1> I wait until some videogame gives us ugly women portagonist or just not pretty :<
[1:05:59] <KessOrangeSoda> @rudiciuscaesar I didn't even play FF7 until 2005, she just featured in a huge amount of available porn on the internet at the time.
[1:06:01] <suitangi021> Barret's the MVP in terms of character in this remake
[1:06:05] <ZE_Count> I like Barret new characterization as environmental preacher dad whos afraid of heights.
[1:06:15] <+JamesCorck> Art Gripe has been invoked º3º
[1:06:19] <turbofolk> Tifa has come as pessimistic in a lot of scene in remake
[1:06:20] <itsbullzie> I like Jessie the best
[1:06:22] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Yeah this looks more Akira than FF7
[1:06:24] <SilverRoddo> The feel of rubble.
[1:06:27] <Livelinne> Tbh I like your criticism. So please keep it up
[1:06:30] <Sokumotanaka> I like her dad humor it gives her more than just making her "girl 2"
[1:06:30] <rudiciuscaesar> @KessOrangeSoda not sure how old you are but 1997 was when I played it but I was about to go into high school, sooo yeah. Sexuality.
[1:06:53] <OToole42> flying enemies with gravity spells
[1:07:04] <oshkeet41> I think there's that worry esp with what happened lately, to course-correct Aeris goin too anime, and maybe they went a little harder than needed.
[1:07:08] <rudiciuscaesar> like these flying dudes need nerfed. They should have like 4 times the stagger when they're super far away.
[1:07:18] <kentrix11> Oh yeah Tifa with double charges can actually do fairly good aerial combos.
[1:07:19] <rudiciuscaesar> gambits?
[1:07:27] <BurdRightsActivist> I think it's because you didn't get to play Berret for quite a peroid of time in this game, sot hey just want him to feel more useful
[1:07:30] <rudiciuscaesar> are they still called that? or is that solely just FF12?
[1:07:33] <xeros720> they kind of do have 4 times stagger in the air, but only to aero, and that's really hard to hit with
[1:07:34] <KessOrangeSoda> @rudiciuscaesar I was 15 in 2005, but I had Tifa "art" access since well before that.
[1:07:41] <suitangi021> How are they going to handle Giant flying enemies in later games is my question
[1:07:52] <Frankomancer> poorly
[1:07:53] <ZE_Count> rope on ground mean target nearby
[1:08:04] <ZE_Count> hawt
[1:08:05] <BurdRightsActivist> LOADING LEDGES PogChamp
[1:08:07] <Lenmutt> wow facecam Eli haven't seen your face since that old superbestfriendcast preview
[1:08:10] <+ErrorinBluescreen> become one
[1:08:12] <arkv01> "mmmm it's time to become one, cloud"
[1:08:16] <SilverRoddo> Perhaps a dilapidated building resembles a bird cage, for flying type of enemies. I assume it was thematically designed that way. HahaThink
[1:08:28] <rudiciuscaesar> OH GOD, @KessOrangeSoda yeah, I get that. I grew up with the original FF7. Aeris was literally the first girl I drew in a 'special' way.
[1:08:48] <WhatAngelMemesMe> Cloud becomes Peter Griffin.
[1:08:58] <turbofolk> Don't worry about it
[1:09:00] <BurdRightsActivist> LODING LEDGE 2 PogChamp
[1:09:10] <rudiciuscaesar> and ATB should be at least 1/3rds and you should get a 1/4th in the Refocus.
[1:09:11] <Ashenik1> loading time ??
[1:09:43] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, casual dodging of bullets!
[1:09:51] <SupportWriter> @PlagueOfGripes This game did go through a couple of restarts
[1:09:53] <rudiciuscaesar> Cloud just was like "yeah, ok."
[1:09:53] <ZE_Count> Mainly cause the trains and roads are blocked I guess
[1:09:57] <SilverRoddo> What if this environment becomes the boss battle.
[1:10:00] <jaygee303> Boss fight every chapter
[1:10:03] <+silvery_cricket> Is Wedge still alive and still Fat?
[1:10:09] <KessOrangeSoda> yes
[1:10:09] <SupportWriter> At least back when CyberCorp was incharge of the battle system
[1:10:09] <turbofolk> OH YEAH
[1:10:17] <kentrix11> Oh yeah this part was kinda annoying.
[1:10:33] <dmian07> This sorta was in the original tho
[1:10:33] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I wonder if Yuffie will do a naruto run.
[1:10:35] <arkv01> this is like that one section in the original where you have to hide behind pillars from guards
[1:10:36] <BurdRightsActivist> It's a good thing these MACHINE GUN BULLETS only just push me back a bit. Thank goodness!
[1:10:36] <Ashenik1> Still better boss than Bed of Chaos though
[1:10:47] <kentrix11> This music is hype.
[1:10:59] <+silvery_cricket> Is Wedge still dying and fat?
[1:11:01] <+Pyroclase> now they're going back down
[1:11:04] <rudiciuscaesar> @Ashenik1 TRUE, this is better than Bed of Chaos.
[1:11:16] <rudiciuscaesar> holy shit, look, a terrestrial enemy.
[1:11:16] <arkv01> wedge is dying from obesity :(
[1:11:29] <kentrix11> Falling on my face would e less annoying than bed of chaos.
[1:11:44] <+silvery_cricket> I mean wouldn't talking to your demolitions expert be smart before going on a raid?
[1:12:03] <kentrix11> I usually try to play it sage and wait until the enemy finishes their attacks.
[1:12:07] <rudiciuscaesar> wow, this stupid repel energy
[1:12:20] <+stephane3012> so much wind-ups
[1:12:21] <rudiciuscaesar> and yeah, see, Magic should give you armor where you can block at least one attack while casting
[1:12:24] <kentrix11> They die easy to thunder.
[1:12:32] <rudiciuscaesar> and you take the damage, but aren't knocked out of your animation.
[1:12:33] <OToole42> good luck casting it
[1:12:50] <kentrix11> It's easy to cast though.
[1:12:50] <BurdRightsActivist> Silence plague, mr HYPE MAN said this game was AMAZING
[1:13:03] <itsbullzie> well I will give them props for trying to be creative...
[1:13:18] <$jamarartdoodles> How was Shinra planning on pay for all this destruction
[1:13:18] <kentrix11> Like thunder is the most reliable magic and casting lvl2 magic is fairly easy if you do it after an enemy attacks.
[1:13:19] <SilverRoddo> Perhaps players need to switch between characters to chain combos, tag team style?
[1:13:20] <rudiciuscaesar> Square gets a major A for effort for sure.
[1:13:24] <suitangi021> If enemies had hitstun the same you you do I imagine it would be infinitely better.
[1:13:25] <Ashenik1> @PlagueOfGripes so would you say combat is bad or is it just PLague complaining about the thing he likes?
[1:13:26] <SupportWriter> Eh, Max is a bootlicker
[1:13:28] <arkv01> got a real metal gear solid 1 vibe this section when you're playing cat and mouse with the hind D
[1:13:43] <+silvery_cricket> You know changing the timeline so Wedge lives but not doing anything with him makes me focus more on Wedge than Aerith.
[1:13:43] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist @SupportWriter Give him time.
[1:13:54] <OToole42> it would be nicer if the roll had i frames, and you could roll cancel ATB abilities
[1:14:05] <OToole42> so you could dodge the annoying knockback
[1:14:10] <kentrix11> Use magnify and fire on those guys takes them down so you can hit them easy.
[1:14:10] <SupportWriter> Like he went through a I LOVE GG, I HATE GG, I LOVE GG, I HATE...
[1:14:14] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeltonZ I've been watching his streams so I can see the inevitable heartbreak when it goes full Nonumbop
[1:14:20] <ZE_Count> I always buy the stuff on sale
[1:14:23] <KessOrangeSoda> @OToole42 or if you could roll cancel AT ALL
[1:14:28] <Frankomancer> @SupportWriter my thoughts too
[1:14:28] <rudiciuscaesar> my one friend on Facebook, I say "friend" loosely, actually hate his guts, he and I are always on the other side in our arguments. If I like blue, he likes red and thinks anyone who likes blue is a piece of shit. If I said on Facebook I hated this game, he would say "NO, it's perfect!"
[1:14:33] <OToole42> @KessOrangeSoda yeah!
[1:14:36] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist SAME. Sometimes I even watch him and Plague at the same time on two screens. It's great!
[1:15:04] <rudiciuscaesar> so that type of person exists, and we need to avoid listening to those people who are just always on the wrong side. Plague is well known for his accurate critiques of things because he uses his brain, rather than his American muscles.
[1:15:09] <WhatAngelMemesMe> I would like for the devs to make mistakes now and show great progress and learning in future parts. That'd be nice.
[1:15:11] <oshkeet41> I think the iss ue is like, a lot of ans dont make a distinction between minor flaws and genuine dealbreakers. Latter just ruins your ability to play but the former doesnt while still being kind of annoying.
[1:15:14] <BurdRightsActivist> @GeltonZ The more ff7 streams you watch at once the bigger your brain is
[1:15:29] <arkv01> the game isn't great about letting you build style meter with continuous wacky smacky
[1:15:33] <GeltonZ> @BurdRightsActivist YES.
[1:15:42] <IntrepidEye> All the enemies that have stunlocking abilities
[1:15:42] <ZE_Count> I just kill everything with big magic
[1:15:46] <+stephane3012> or the enemy use status ailments that incapacitate you
[1:15:50] <itsbullzie> @plagueofgripes Doom Eternal does this with one enemy or two. Make them hard
[1:15:59] <kentrix11> idk I feel your thing of never using spells kinda makes this more anoying than it reasonably should, like it if pay attention to enemies casting isn't really that unsafe.
[1:16:07] <@DCN2049> he played eternal already
[1:16:20] <xeros720> you just reminded me that i need to level up some anti-sleep materia
[1:16:22] <nitchravencraft> As someone who barely knew about ff7 growing up, I see issues with the game in this remake, but also reasons why I assume the fans love this game so much. There's a lot here I can simply enjoy; it's own charm, I suppose.
[1:16:24] <arkv01> fruits go down ast
[1:16:26] <arkv01> *fast
[1:16:29] <OToole42> maybe stop for a snack?
[1:16:30] <kentrix11> Eternal has a boss that changes the genre from fps to action.
[1:16:32] <arkv01> get some carbsss
[1:16:33] <itsbullzie> @dcn2049 did he like it? I did
[1:16:33] <ZE_Count> the good ones
[1:16:45] <+silvery_cricket> HUNGRY LIKE WEDGE
[1:16:46] <ZE_Count> Look at the destruction
[1:16:47] <SilverRoddo> Enemies with immunity conveniences are nice.
[1:16:49] <GeltonZ> That's gonna be my job one day: Making killer mutant strawberries.
[1:16:49] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, I don't think magic is being used to its max potential, and Plague talking about eating is making me uncomfortable lol. I dislike food.
[1:16:52] <KessOrangeSoda> but the VIEW, Plague
[1:17:08] <arkv01> these are death flags
[1:17:11] <shiny_prinny> let's take a moment to admire this money
[1:17:15] <OToole42> I love food
[1:17:16] <arkv01> if we didn't already know how the story unfolds
[1:17:17] <turbofolk> VIWE PLAGUE
[1:17:22] <Ashenik1> @PlagueOfGripes What game would you say has done a really good job at increasing difficulty level but still keeping combat fresh and fun?
[1:17:24] <nitchravencraft> Bless the hair in this game, honestly.
[1:17:25] <+silvery_cricket> Well her entire life has been anhillated twice
[1:17:31] <$jamarartdoodles> With all that scrap materials won't be a problem
[1:17:39] <KessOrangeSoda> Cloud was always kind of a prick
[1:17:40] <SilverRoddo> RPGPhatLoot
[1:17:43] <OToole42> Had my jaw wired shut in my youth, never took food for granted after it was removed
[1:17:48] <Shwepie> Everyone forgot and says he's an asshole for having.
[1:17:58] <%bettysharkface> Cloud thoroughly believes in the fuck you pay me lifestyle
[1:17:58] <Djinnazz> Don't worry bout it.
[1:18:10] <KessOrangeSoda> lol nope
[1:18:11] <ZE_Count> nathan drake
[1:18:16] <oshkeet41> Well the merc aspect also helps in that Cloud can do touchyfeely nice things under the excuse if he's paid for it he 'has to' vs admitting he's emotionally invested in anything
[1:18:21] <Djinnazz> it does a good job of telling you about the points of no return.
[1:18:30] <BurdRightsActivist> GENIUS NONUMBO
[1:18:30] <Void_The_Dark> Crash Bandicoot section
[1:18:49] <rudiciuscaesar> the others are useless.
[1:18:51] <turbofolk> He might've as well been throwing pebbles instead of bullets
[1:18:51] <arkv01> I'm sure shinra's got more than one drone
[1:18:55] <rudiciuscaesar> why can't they use magic constantly?
[1:18:56] <KessOrangeSoda> MAGICKS
[1:18:59] <rudiciuscaesar> they need ATB?
[1:18:59] <%CyberDingus> ONE MAN ARMY
[1:19:05] <arkv01> also wow big HP number on barret
[1:19:05] <rudiciuscaesar> wait, wait, wait
[1:19:08] <Lenmutt> Throw your sword Cloud!
[1:19:10] <terminusterminal> They have no ATB for magic dude
[1:19:10] <ZE_Count> magic in like 5 secs
[1:19:11] <Ashenik1> yeah thats dumb
[1:19:12] <rudiciuscaesar> ATB refills so slow!?
[1:19:13] <xeros720> the assess screen pretty much yells at you to use lightning on this boss
[1:19:21] <%Demirose41> this is the way
[1:19:31] <rudiciuscaesar> so now cna Tifa do a spell?
[1:19:41] <kentrix11> You can use haste with magnify to kinda solve that.
[1:19:45] <arkv01> I saw tifa get knocked out of world here on a twitter clip LUL
[1:19:54] <jon651> blocking attacks fill atb
[1:19:56] <terminusterminal> The only way to get ATB on an enemy like this for Phys characters is to guard and hope the enemy hits you. Curl into a ball and weep
[1:19:56] <Frankomancer> its really bad how blatant the ai focuses on you
[1:19:59] <kentrix11> It makes characters get atb even if you don't control them.
[1:20:07] <BurdRightsActivist> you can HIT HIM NOW Pog
[1:20:12] <KessOrangeSoda> good thing that grapple doesn't have a weight limit, apparently
[1:20:31] <terminusterminal> There is a lot of sleep in this game.
[1:20:32] <shiny_prinny> from what i can tell, it seems like it might be better to just remove ATB entirely
[1:20:33] <arkv01> everyone so schleepy
[1:20:34] <%bettysharkface> Nighty byes
[1:20:34] <rudiciuscaesar> @terminusterminal thank you for clarifying, and wow, that needs patched. They should be able to gain ATB faster
[1:20:41] <BurdRightsActivist> KEK
[1:20:42] <+HRDSalami654> Feels great.
[1:20:45] <SilverRoddo> Shoot your hook into it’s blades, cLoUd, duH
[1:20:46] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:20:47] <turbofolk> Nice
[1:21:15] <oshkeet41> honestly when i go to play this i wanna see if 'easy mode' has less interupt nonsense, cause seeing folks, id prefer it
[1:21:34] <turbofolk> What was the point of that?
[1:21:39] <arkv01> would've been amazing if we got a grenade launcher weapon for barret for this stage
[1:21:47] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, Plague is correct, they need to fix that.
[1:22:07] <+BigCoffee> @arkv01 in the origina game there's literally a missile launcher arm gun
[1:22:08] <rudiciuscaesar> can your limit breaks be interrupted then?
[1:22:10] <kentrix11> But plague can't you reas the enemy animations wait until they finish and attack and use tha topening to use your atb?
[1:22:12] <turbofolk> tiny shit rockets out of defeated enemy and suddenly its back on the fight?
[1:22:14] <Lenmutt> So how would you say you're liking this compared to the original?
[1:22:16] <jon651> I know who you're talking about. DOOMRATS!!
[1:22:26] <xeros720> limit breaks can't be interrupted, but you still take damage
[1:22:36] <xeros720> so it's quite possible for a character to die while doing one
[1:22:41] <arkv01> cmere demon man
[1:22:45] <SupportWriter> Cutscenes can interrupt them
[1:22:46] <rudiciuscaesar> ok, that's bullshit with the limit breaks
[1:22:47] <IntrepidEye> I remember chasing a drake around for five minutes because it just kept flying away whenever Cloud jumped to try to hit it
[1:22:51] <xeros720> however, most of them will actually hitstun bosses
[1:22:52] <rudiciuscaesar> it should be like the summon's super.
[1:23:07] <arkv01> yeah consensus has been aerial combat needs work
[1:23:09] <+forgetme000> oh i just beat this right before clicking on the stream lol
[1:23:14] <xeros720> i noticed on the summon bosses, like leviathan or bahamut, they will still wreck you if you use them without thought
[1:23:16] <rudiciuscaesar> when Ifrit does Hellfire, he waits till no one has a conflicting animation, and then gets to do his move, no ands ifs or buts
[1:23:25] <terminusterminal> Was that Barrett's AVALANCHE satellite cannon?
[1:23:37] <+BigCoffee> is this Hard mode?
[1:23:44] <arkv01> normal mode, first run
[1:23:49] <+BigCoffee> oh boy.....
[1:23:50] <rudiciuscaesar> @BigCoffee no, normal mode.
[1:23:55] <kentrix11> I thought plague put it on easy?
[1:23:58] <+BigCoffee> wait barret has 9k hp this is ridiculous
[1:24:08] <SilverRoddo> Yes, Aeons.
[1:24:13] <KessOrangeSoda> it's the thing it released it the cutscene while it was idle, right?
[1:24:13] <turbofolk> Hammer of dawn
[1:24:14] <+stratibario> its part of that robot
[1:24:18] <terminusterminal> Hey Barrett has an orbital cannon too. He just needs the Limit Break
[1:24:18] <BurdRightsActivist> It's the lil pod copter up there firing down the beam, the thing he shot off
[1:24:18] <rudiciuscaesar> I hate all this new Shinra tech, i kinda like that they were just like 1980s tech with robots that look like shit.
[1:24:23] <arkv01> wouldn't be surprised if they changed it so that their space program did put lasers in the sky
[1:24:25] <+forgetme000> i don't know what the beam thing is either
[1:24:33] <Djinnazz> Cloud just takin a break.
[1:24:42] <terminusterminal> I do admit to missing FF7's anime retrofuturism style.
[1:24:42] <rudiciuscaesar> boss will get back up.
[1:24:42] <arkv01> shouldn't it explode?
[1:24:45] <rudiciuscaesar> and explode or whatever
[1:24:54] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar the later robots in og were more sofisticated like this ones.
[1:25:11] <rudiciuscaesar> yeah, the later ones, cuz Shinra had to kick it into high gear, that's fine.
[1:25:13] <kentrix11> No one can know if you just kill everybody.
[1:25:17] <rudiciuscaesar> and Barret is dead.
[1:25:19] <+stephane3012> falling off a ledge for the 60th time
[1:25:24] <+Manjove> they turned off the trains
[1:25:26] <law240> the trains aren't running
[1:25:28] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes the train's arent running
[1:25:30] <+Manjove> they talked about this
[1:25:32] <rudiciuscaesar> the Time Ghosts should have saved him!
[1:25:34] <Ashenik1> Whom would you sleep with guy: Cloud or Tifa. I prefer blondes :3
[1:25:35] <+BigCoffee> the shinra assault was a surprise
[1:25:36] <+forgetme000> the trains are shut down
[1:25:43] <+BigCoffee> now its just wut
[1:25:45] <BillieNoMates> faster to spiderman up
[1:25:45] <turbofolk> Suck it up lague Nomura is in charge now
[1:25:46] <jiin6> wasn't there train gates too
[1:25:48] <BurdRightsActivist> To be fair, they probably expect them to take the trains or something.
[1:25:50] <arkv01> gotta be canon though
[1:25:53] <Frankomancer> wow i was l on the edge of my seat during that cutscene you guys
[1:25:57] <rudiciuscaesar> I'm a straight man, and I'd like Cloud have his way with me. fyi.
[1:26:00] <oshkeet41> i mean you could straight up steal various cares/bikes abandoned around
[1:26:00] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar I mean I thought it was because you were dealing with higher ups, like I doubt they "kicked into high gear" in a few days theya lready had that tech.
[1:26:01] <+Manjove> and get into a big long fight when they are trying to stealth
[1:26:06] <Dark_Wint3r> Now the whole things ruined
[1:26:08] <seth45er> why doesn't barrets gun arm have the grapple launcher?
[1:26:12] <+BigCoffee> will plague go in the front door
[1:26:14] <Livelinne> But there’s no tiiiiime BibleThump
[1:26:16] <+BigCoffee> or climb 65 stairs
[1:26:23] <turbofolk> Wouldnt the station be super busted by the plate falling down on top of it
[1:26:24] <BillieNoMates> Gackt ofc LUL
[1:26:28] <tolloponik> some guys try
[1:26:30] <BurdRightsActivist> Bruce Lee?
[1:26:34] <sosuke5> Koreans?
[1:26:34] <GeltonZ> So you've never seen Gackt then
[1:26:39] <Djinnazz> Japan
[1:26:42] <tolloponik> K POP
[1:26:44] <kentrix11> Honestly I really think you should equip thunder or fire, since you will fight lots of monsters and machines.
[1:26:47] <Sokumotanaka> They all almost died and all tifa can say is "yeah" ?
[1:26:50] <turbofolk> Koreans kpop fuckers
[1:26:50] <rudiciuscaesar> ohhhh, yeah, like Heidegger and Scarlet would have access to better stuff, the A tier dudes would guard the A tier execs.
[1:26:55] <kentrix11> Gackt?
[1:26:57] <Kampler21> So Cloud is soy
[1:27:03] <SilverRoddo> Early Dir en Grey were cool.
[1:27:04] <GeltonZ> You know...this would be the ONE TIME a K-Pop Stan posting a random clip would be fitting!
[1:27:10] <rudiciuscaesar> like Rufus should be guarded by SOLDIERS 1st class only.
[1:27:11] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes The long face/nose is what upsets me...
[1:27:13] <Ashenik1> Plague so you have not seen much twink porn :3
[1:27:16] <jiin6> you're listing the majority of most JRPG protagonists
[1:27:17] <BurdRightsActivist> MGS3 4Head
[1:27:19] <rudiciuscaesar> fuck, I said Rufus and imagined Rufus from SF4 shit.
[1:27:21] <rudiciuscaesar> Kill me.
[1:27:29] <oshkeet41> I wish they woulda just leaned into the fact Cloud doesnt look that tough and is trying to look cool (cause thats sorta true) but they want that AND for him to be a pretty anime boy
[1:27:37] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Tifa Jesus Christ c'mon
[1:27:51] <kentrix11> @rudiciuscaesar Rufus explicitly is overconfident and goes alone so not really, also Sephi probably killed any soldier that was witht he president.
[1:27:55] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah Tifa let's let Aerith get knotted
[1:28:10] <+whiskey_wolfe_> laaaame
[1:28:13] <arkv01> the front door option was always kinda silly
[1:28:16] <turbofolk> Wont you give praise to the banter between them plague?
[1:28:22] <jon651> no choice 0/10 games terrible.
[1:28:25] <rudiciuscaesar> ok, that makes sense, yeah, like President Shina would have like 4 as his personal guards and Sephiroth just aborts them.
[1:28:31] <+CrimsonDio11> stairs and elevator choice comes later iirc
[1:28:35] <rudiciuscaesar> holy shit, Rufus is just a hillbilly
[1:28:42] <rudiciuscaesar> dude with shotgun and dog.
[1:28:42] <+Pyroclase> You know they are.
[1:28:43] <OToole42> that same criteria applies to my brother in law
[1:28:50] <kentrix11> Even better!
[1:28:53] <Sokumotanaka> If it's still here
[1:28:54] <+whiskey_wolfe_> yes, he will tank 10,000 blows
[1:28:54] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao Rufus should be the Cainhurst Crow
[1:28:54] <OToole42> white coat wesker
[1:28:54] <BurdRightsActivist> WESKER IS TELEPORTING HE'S NOT STEPPING FAST
[1:28:55] <kentrix11> or worse
[1:28:55] <turbofolk> But he always like that tho
[1:28:59] <suitangi021> You mean like the changes to Reno?
[1:29:00] <rudiciuscaesar> just uses the Old Hunter's Bone.
[1:29:00] <BillieNoMates> Inb4 Rufus is full Dante
[1:29:01] <kentrix11> depends what you like.
[1:29:02] <kingra> He's gonna be Krauser
[1:29:06] <Lenmutt> Hobo with a shotgun anime adaptation when?
[1:29:10] <SilverRoddo> I want a Belgar fight.
[1:29:21] <IntrepidEye> Rufus is...interesting
[1:29:24] <Sokumotanaka> I don't think he'll be here they might use that soldier oc
[1:29:29] <kentrix11> Rufus is a big Nomura character honestly, in this and the original.
[1:29:35] <+Pyroclase> This looks incredible. I think Midgar is becoming one of my favorite settings.
[1:29:35] <arkv01> is this war money stuff a meta commentary on america?
[1:29:46] <Ashenik1> This huge ass buliding give me Blade Runner vibes
[1:29:48] <peachteagaming> Plague let me rub your face!
[1:29:49] <BurdRightsActivist> BLOW UP OVER ME BARRET Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:29:52] <rudiciuscaesar> Rufus white coat over his other white coat now looks even dumber.
[1:29:52] <+Manjove> not all War Money shit is about america
[1:29:53] <Sol_Install> how things going?
[1:29:54] <BillieNoMates> Tifa is clearly the most realistic character
[1:29:57] <kentrix11> Honestly the atmosphere in this game is really good.
[1:30:01] <%CyberDingus> Tifa's boobs contain the Dreams and Hopes of the men
[1:30:03] <+whiskey_wolfe_> I like the way Barret lets Cloud get away with all this sass for no reason.
[1:30:03] <KessOrangeSoda> Tifa's contribution: Bounces on heels once so she jiggles.
[1:30:04] <Frankomancer> okay but her boobs are REAALLY big, though
[1:30:07] <+JamesCorck> Not anymore you don't have a bar XD
[1:30:10] <BillieNoMates> Just doesnt talk because everyone is so full of retardation that there's nothing to add
[1:30:10] <SilverRoddo> I figure Rufus’ plan is similar to Shepherd’s plan in Modern Warfare 2.
[1:30:12] <Sol_Install> her boobs are like ok
[1:30:13] <rudiciuscaesar> atmosphere of this game is really good, agreed.
[1:30:13] <+ErrorinBluescreen> Midgar is just messy starship interior pornography taken to its logical extreme
[1:30:15] <turbofolk> Hey remember in AC when cloud was moping around and tifa just watched
[1:30:22] <kentrix11> Don't forget that she's really not sure about doing any of this and kinda scared.
[1:30:22] <Kampler21> Imagine if Aerith had better boobs than Tifa's lol
[1:30:25] <rudiciuscaesar> uh oh? Twitch?

[1:31:46] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Plague stop monologuing your stream died.
[1:31:47] <@Nightbot> @Livelinne -> Terminated! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]

[1:32:23] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes your stream died...sorry if you already knew and this message is a bother....
[1:32:24] <itsbullzie> awe man
[1:32:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Channel points let you add purple background text to your posts.
[1:32:41] <@DCN2049> His internet is gone, guys. @ing him is pointless
[1:32:50] <rudiciuscaesar> is that it? Channel points can't be used for anyhting else?
[1:32:50] <peachteagaming> rudiciuscaesar channel points lets you hightlight messages
[1:32:51] <+Pyroclase> ah, that sucks
