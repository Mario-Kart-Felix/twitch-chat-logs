[0:01:34] <CaptHat211> No way f*g is funnier

[0:01:46] <+LordSDB> Huge woolie!
[0:01:59] <StonerStan101> Ducktales.
[0:02:16] <silvcrest> lets get this shitshow started.
[0:02:22] <LunarRemix> Nah do it with Barret and Cloud.
[0:02:35] <+Punishedkaiger> 13 or 14 I think
[0:02:54] <Deadbulky> The shitshow never ended lsxyzA
[0:02:56] <Sol_Install> yoyo
[0:03:01] <@dcn2049> what chapter is this
[0:03:06] <Sol_Install> this is ch13
[0:03:07] <CaptHat211> DAMMIT NOMURA
[0:03:08] <Coystick> Hour-wise how fat is this?
[0:03:11] <Sol_Install> remember from last night
[0:03:15] <@dcn2049> excellent, stupid time soon
[0:03:17] <baronblank> honestly I thought up to 18 was fine, 18 was the downfall
[0:03:19] <TheWe4pon> even more stupid then this? jesus christ
[0:03:19] <SuperSmashIke> This game gets kinda King Hearts like later on lmao
[0:03:22] <@dcn2049> Told you
[0:03:26] <SuperSmashIke> Kingdom Hearts lol**
[0:03:27] <Sol_Install> I like Chadley tbh
[0:03:32] <+justianxix> This got a long way to go
[0:03:32] <notanegg8> watched someone finish the game today, i have very mixed feelings about it
[0:03:33] <TheWe4pon> get out
[0:03:36] <baronblank> though there were some dumb things before that, it wasn't nearly as bad
[0:03:41] <+silvery_cricket> Chadley looks like the fuck that would take pictures up girls skirts.
[0:03:52] <jo_vo> Can I offer you a materia in these trying times?
[0:03:53] <@dcn2049> "Fight a virtual rendition of my unloving mother for me, please"
[0:03:56] <silvcrest> now that the blinders are off I can see you were right.
[0:03:56] <Sol_Install> Chadley doesn't interfere with the story like other shit
[0:03:59] <Futurecity10> shut up chadley you fucking twink
[0:04:01] <Coystick> yeah who would do that h-haha
[0:04:01] <TheWe4pon> parry materia?
[0:04:15] <Deadbulky> Kinda dissapointed how droping the plate wasnt as brutal as the original
[0:04:29] <%Samex_Comex> Yeehaw!
[0:05:19] <mr_slaide> OMG, it's Plague, he's complaining about stuff! WE LOVE YOU, PLAGUE!
[0:05:45] <mr_slaide> Nah, they're basically ignored.
[0:05:49] <TheWe4pon> did the big light roll over and crush the playe in this version?
[0:05:53] <TheWe4pon> plate
[0:05:54] <terminusterminal> Bust out the Fat Chocobo.
[0:05:59] <terminusterminal> Get this show on the road
[0:06:04] <mr_slaide> Fat or phat?
[0:06:56] <silvcrest> there is a way. I've seen it. Don't remember how
[0:07:06] <LunarRemix> Does Barret have his stupid metal ball weapon in this game?
[0:07:16] <Sol_Install> focused shot is REALLY good
[0:08:18] <Futurecity10> did plague die or was that my connection
[0:08:19] <Coystick> oh no
[0:08:23] <mr_slaide> F
[0:08:25] <@dcn2049> nice
[0:08:30] <TheWe4pon> nah hes live
[0:08:34] <TheWe4pon> nvm
[0:08:35] <mr_slaide> Word
[0:08:37] <Futurecity10> he's back
[0:08:38] <SuperSmashIke> @Futurecity10 Same thing happened to me
[0:08:39] <Futurecity10> twitch died
[0:08:46] <+Punishedkaiger> Sick, twitch died for a second
[0:08:49] <notanegg8> it's all good now
[0:08:50] <cap_bon> so how bad is picard because im morbidly curious
[0:08:50] <Coystick> PlagueOfPacketLoss
[0:09:05] <mr_slaide> Picard is a shit show.
[0:09:53] <cap_bon> like haha lets watch this train wreck with friends or oh god what a waste of time
[0:10:01] <mr_slaide> Waste of time.
[0:10:25] <$Reukey0> God this games is beautiful
[0:10:33] <cap_bon> the worst sin of time being boring
[0:10:33] <CaptHat211> I lost you there for a second
[0:10:47] <cap_bon> all*
[0:10:47] <%Samex_Comex> You can do it frames
[0:10:58] <Coystick> Dark Souls run3 wen?
[0:11:09] <cap_bon> never hopefully
[0:11:12] <+dezimaly> the down side of "Fuckit, we'll do it live!'
[0:11:32] <Coystick> @cap coward
[0:12:05] <+justianxix> atleast we get to hear this song again
[0:12:07] <+dezimaly> come back in disk 2
[0:12:07] <+polypolipauli> make ghost babies
[0:12:13] <cap_bon> I dont want to be reminded that the Dark Souls series ends with you fighting Some Guy in a wasteland of ash for no reason
[0:12:30] <Futurecity10> >cuck beetle
[0:12:40] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh fullbody huggers
[0:13:03] <Coystick> I mean that's Gwyn's fight in a nutshell
[0:13:15] <Futurecity10> I like you, come over and fuck my daughter
[0:13:33] <+silvery_cricket> she is 6
[0:13:49] <+silvery_cricket> and has a gun
[0:13:58] <Futurecity10> That was more of a blanket statement than a reference to barret
[0:14:00] <+justianxix> With new Robo hands
[0:14:26] <Frankomancer> there are a looooot of battle arenas
[0:14:49] <+silvery_cricket> No Plague get in the gummy ship
[0:14:54] <Sol_Install> I'm gonna bet they'll do a FF7R Part1.5 or some dumb shit before Part 2 comes out
[0:15:05] <%Samex_Comex> Hug me!
[0:15:08] <silvcrest> You cam really see thhe ff13 influence
[0:15:18] <Futurecity10> What the fuck are the references plague
[0:15:19] <cap_bon> let me grab you and tell you about time ghosts
[0:15:21] <ugutetris> is this the kingdom hearts expansion?
[0:15:37] <$vampireinarm> the theme for this place reminds me of P3
[0:15:46] <MESeele> !uptime
[0:15:46] <@Nightbot> 15 minutes 58 seconds
[0:15:49] <Sol_Install> yea
[0:15:51] <MESeele> sweet
[0:15:57] <+silvery_cricket> The superman costume cucking is a rick and morty reference
[0:16:13] <Futurecity10> Yeah but why would bugs be wearing the costume
[0:16:23] <Oleai> You must love the Sahagin.
[0:16:31] <$vampireinarm> yeah enemies on normal are just damage sponges for the most part
[0:16:44] <%Samex_Comex> I'm always dressed as superman
[0:17:27] <Oleai> Everything in this game fucks.
[0:17:37] <+dezimaly> part of the Shinra fuck science division
[0:17:38] <+silvery_cricket> Life uh... finds a way
[0:17:40] <terminusterminal> Is there some sort of Blue Magic in this game>
[0:17:45] <$vampireinarm> you need the Enemy Skill from Chadley
[0:17:47] <Jrockoni> that's hojo's fetish
[0:17:56] <notanegg8> priority one for the r&d division was ensuring their ability to fuck
[0:17:57] <terminusterminal> Oh no not Chadley again
[0:18:11] <mr_slaide> Tifa is basically a damage monster.
[0:18:14] <+samirrsp> but only 4 skills....
[0:18:14] <BTRNDL> Chadley pvpWTF
[0:18:34] <Oleai> That is literally Hojo's fetish. If Hojo was alone on an island he will attempt to get the crabs and bananas to fuck eachother.
[0:19:04] <Jrockoni> and record it.
[0:19:17] <mr_slaide> And clone it.
[0:19:22] <cap_bon> Oh this screen
[0:19:29] <EliahNebb> Thank goodness you cleaned your room.
[0:19:35] <+silvery_cricket> Never forget Hojo cucked Vincent.
[0:20:01] <terminusterminal> I can't imagine anybody losing to Hojo but here we are
[0:20:11] <silvcrest> I forgot about that
[0:20:12] <SuperSmashIke> This game needs more blood in it, especially blood cleverly hidden in assorted candy bar wrappers
[0:20:14] <$vampireinarm> the SP investment on early weapons isnt great
[0:20:17] <mr_slaide> She wanted Hojo's science juice.
[0:20:24] <LunarRemix> They should be good considering Barret's weapon is a machinegun and hits multiple times
[0:20:30] <Oleai> Hojo is low-key the primary villain of the entire game. Also the strongest, but indirectly.
[0:20:37] <EliahNebb> Then clean your room.
[0:20:46] <+justianxix> Didn't Hojo straight up NTR vincent like in one of those doujins
[0:20:48] <Oleai> No, make the room dirtier
[0:20:52] <mr_slaide> Making the bed is for nerds.
[0:20:58] <silvcrest> yes @justianxix
[0:20:59] <LunarRemix> Isn't Hojo the straight up villain of Dirge of Cercerus?
[0:21:02] <sosuke5> You don't sleep in a bed envelope like a normal person?
[0:21:06] <Coystick> Noooooooo
[0:21:06] <$vampireinarm> LUL
[0:21:08] <Oleai> This is what I came to see
[0:21:10] <%Samex_Comex> You mad man!
[0:21:11] <Coystick> it was so neat
[0:21:11] <mr_slaide> HELL YEAH!
[0:21:12] <+justianxix> Thats Kinda Hilarious
[0:21:13] <EliahNebb> Well. I hope you're happy.
[0:21:19] <%Samex_Comex> Mom is gonna get mad!
[0:21:29] <silvcrest> nice
[0:21:30] <Coystick> Fucking hell I'm telling
[0:21:35] <cap_bon> but what about the orb
[0:21:41] <+silvery_cricket> Hojo is the internet never forget.
[0:21:45] <mr_slaide> They prefer dark, moist places, like Woolie.
[0:22:41] <Oleai> Tifa plays the best, imo. But Barret is the most satisfying. Cloud is somehow the most meh.
[0:22:55] <Coystick> How long until Brennan Williams does a Barret cosi in the ring?
[0:22:56] <+justianxix> I always liked how Hojo was the secret big bad along side Jenova, because before you always underestimated him
[0:22:58] <%Samex_Comex> Take that landhorse
[0:23:10] <+silvery_cricket> What is the percent chance the Remakes turn into a KH crossover
[0:23:17] <+silvery_cricket> I want to say at least
[0:23:21] <+silvery_cricket> 15%
[0:23:23] <silvcrest> 100
[0:23:29] <mr_slaide> Depends how well it sells.
[0:23:34] <@dcn2049> gotta get Plague a green screen
[0:23:35] <Oleai> 0%. Nomura is getting his KH crossover into 14.
[0:23:47] <$vampireinarm> your head does a good job re-distributing more light around around yourself
[0:23:56] <Coystick> Missile Silo home
[0:23:57] <Flamethrowerman09> I find it really funny that, according to Crisis Core, Sephiroth's hair is bleached white.
[0:24:03] <mr_slaide> Are they seriously doing a KH crossover in FF XIV?
[0:24:03] <$Reukey0> but no sunlight
[0:24:03] <%Samex_Comex> Just his cartoon face behind him the whole time
[0:24:04] <@dcn2049> An underground home would be best
[0:24:12] <sosuke5> I would kind of want to see a KH remake, just cut out most of the bullshit.
[0:24:27] <mr_slaide> Exactly those noises?
[0:24:34] <+arancet> can confirm, am human, probably
[0:24:39] <+justianxix> But all the BS is the fun part of KH
[0:24:47] <silvcrest> according to CC, Sephiroth spends two hours a day on hair care
[0:25:05] <Frankomancer> i wonder how they plan to keep this combat interesting for another entire game after this one
[0:25:18] <$Reukey0> But plague underground home means no more sunlight.
[0:25:25] <+silvery_cricket> @Frankomancer It is just KH's combat
[0:25:33] <+silvery_cricket> The hud is even the same
[0:27:17] <$vampireinarm> link a magnify materia with cure, its gonna save you so many headaches
[0:27:19] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:27:22] <LunarRemix> KH combat is way 'lighter' than this.
[0:27:35] <CaptHat211> I don't care for FF7, but I love Tifa.
[0:27:37] <LunarRemix> It's more about fighting waves of enemies instead of 2-3 at a time
[0:27:51] <Sol_Install> this is KH meeting FF14 to me
[0:28:46] <mr_slaide> Plague, I can assure you, this is intended. You're not different than other streamers. The damage in this game is high.
[0:29:15] <CaptHat211> @mr_slaide The idiotic changes are high too.
[0:29:27] <terminusterminal> Is deadly dodge any good? Seems pretty nice from all the dodging you've been doing
[0:29:51] <SuperSmashIke> GlagueOfPripes
[0:30:02] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no bums!
[0:30:26] <+arancet> getting sick of this track...
[0:30:53] <CaptHat211> @arancet it is rather monotonous
[0:31:24] <mr_slaide> Don't forget the rejuv stones too!
[0:31:32] <mr_slaide> Gems I mean.
[0:31:41] <TimetodiveLTX> !uptime
[0:31:42] <@Nightbot> 31 minutes 53 seconds
[0:32:01] <@dcn2049> DS2 had the whole soul gem nonsense, yeah. And an attribute that directly tied to how fast you consumed items
[0:32:17] <LunarRemix> And how good your dodge was.
[0:32:18] <%Samex_Comex> Nothing beats the hobo life, stabbing folks with my hobo knife
[0:32:19] <notanegg8> i'll probably try out ff7 soon
[0:32:25] <+azure22900> Problem with this game damage needs to be high with the tools you are given, getting good at blocking and dodging massively improves your survivability.
[0:32:31] <mr_slaide> Yeah, npc's are REALLY shy about attacking.
[0:32:38] <$vampireinarm> this theme slaps tho
[0:32:57] <LunarRemix> Although for all the crap DS2 gets, one thing I really liked is how you had stat scalling on armor , so if you build for a tank build you would get extra defense out of it
[0:33:57] <kentrix11> I mean there's tons of stun locking but it barely matters because you can just jump to other character rather than wait there.
[0:34:05] <+azure22900> Also lightning+element on brace makes you immune to those traps apparently? haven't tested it out yet.
[0:34:07] <mr_slaide> Look at that wrestling bullshit.
[0:34:43] <+justianxix> Just realized, that dude is a fucking giant
[0:34:44] <@dcn2049> cloud should have stayed in drag
[0:34:54] <%Samex_Comex> The big guy reminds me of the guys from Urban reign
[0:36:18] <Hydrapissed> SourPls
[0:36:19] <mr_slaide> What about when you meet a boss character that basically wipes the floor with you, joins your party, and become as weak as your characters?
[0:36:27] <notanegg8> oh you thought you were going to get an attack off, that's cute, you're cute
[0:36:37] <Sol_Install> They like feeling up on people chest
[0:36:53] <Coystick> To be fair I would try to grab Tifa if I were a mob
[0:37:14] <Sol_Install> I would grab barret
[0:37:28] <TimetodiveLTX> tags: Mob Sex
[0:37:56] <+fugatlas> i just hopped on, what part is plague on
[0:38:02] <mr_slaide> Every character should have something tat they use their mp for. I see too many people with 1 character that's always at full mp.
[0:38:14] <+azure22900> same location
[0:38:33] <+fugatlas> ah there it is
[0:38:36] <Coystick> Woah that's a long hallway
[0:38:51] <+rytyoung> This song is bumpin
[0:38:58] <nitchravencraft> Hello! How is everyone doing? Y'all staying hydrated?
[0:39:03] <Sol_Install> I'm getting tired of it
[0:39:04] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Have you ever checked out TeamFourStar's FF7 Machinabridged? What do you think of it if you have
[0:39:07] <TimetodiveLTX> can't wait to mod the old musics in
[0:39:10] <+justianxix> Quiet women, I want to Bop SourPls
[0:39:11] <+pheblorganzardo> bwa bwa BWAAAA
[0:39:34] <silvcrest> Are you saying TIME GHOSTS aren't a great idea?
[0:39:55] <+rytyoung> bwa bwa bwaaaa
[0:40:02] <Flamethrowerman09> I quit immediately after the first 2 episodes of season 2. They were god awful
[0:40:05] <+HawkGoggles2> Who?
[0:40:11] <CaptHat211> You Sonovabitch!
[0:40:25] <Coystick> He leaves bigfoot footprints
[0:40:26] <@dcn2049> How dare you, his father was a pachyderm
[0:40:41] <+silvery_cricket> Hey the slums look like they actually should now.
[0:40:41] <+rytyoung> Wymer's the guy who gives you side quests in sector 7
[0:40:47] <mr_slaide> HE'S TRYING IS BEST!
[0:40:49] <mr_slaide> HIS
[0:40:49] <+justianxix> yes
[0:40:56] <CaptHat211> His lucky quarter is under it
[0:41:05] <kentrix11> They are trying to take off the rubble cause they aren't thinking straight.
[0:41:09] <+rytyoung> Improving power levels on the rock LUL
[0:41:14] <Sokumotanaka> Plague come on XD
[0:41:32] <+rytyoung> Betteh
[0:41:40] <mr_slaide> They all died, kiddo.
[0:41:44] <vincerocmm> ttally fn
[0:41:57] <Sol_Install> yea
[0:41:58] <CaptHat211> Cloud: "They're probably dead." *girl starts crying*
[0:41:58] <mr_slaide> Yop.
[0:42:01] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Seriously, dropping a city on top of another city to kill less 6 people seems like a gross overreaction
[0:42:13] <Hydrapissed> comfyBlob
[0:42:16] <kentrix11> Oh yeah it's cartoonish.
[0:42:19] <vincerocmm> bcm zz
[0:42:28] <+rytyoung> It's naasty
[0:42:31] <vincerocmm> b cm zz
[0:42:32] <Sokumotanaka> Like a frog on a road
[0:42:33] <+justianxix> just a bunch of mush
[0:42:35] <@dcn2049> nice
[0:42:37] <%CyberDingus> Plague is positive as always
[0:42:37] <Goergorion> det the shovel
[0:42:41] <CaptHat211> "Look ma I'm roadkill HAHAHA"
[0:42:43] <seth45er> sliced cheese on a coffee table
[0:42:53] <+silvery_cricket> HES FAT
[0:42:54] <mr_slaide> It would actually be closer to mush since w're basically water bags.
[0:42:55] <arran_throttle> the fact that Plague knows this, is spooky
[0:43:00] <+rytyoung> Oh that Wiley coyote had it rough this whole time
[0:43:21] <Ralfclogs> Wedged Wedge...
[0:43:26] <Sokumotanaka> @mr_slaide Why'd you make me have to think about it >,<?
[0:43:37] <Hydrapissed> hip wit da kids plague
[0:43:42] <+Taglog7> no
[0:43:43] <+rytyoung> I like most of the remixes, but a lot of the time the overworld music drones out whatevers on the jukebox
[0:43:46] <+ThePhasingOctopus> cause its an action game now
[0:43:57] <mr_slaide> BIG BERATHU
[0:44:04] <LunarRemix> Probably to make sure the player doesn't miss it
[0:44:08] <Coystick> SHIN BERTHA
[0:44:12] <+justianxix> They remix alot of the same themes, so some of them are always pretty good
[0:44:13] <sniffy77> Big Baka
[0:44:48] <+rytyoung> Magnets bitch!
[0:44:49] <%CyberDingus> He is buff Adam Jensen.
[0:44:53] <mr_slaide> It's fine, don't worry about it.
[0:44:55] <+texflexrex> just screw them on
[0:44:55] <@dcn2049> He uses his mind alone
[0:45:05] <+texflexrex> like a bottle cap
[0:45:08] <Sokumotanaka> Like FMA?
[0:45:13] <mr_slaide> Maybe it's like Full metal alchemist and there are just that many people with prosthetics?
[0:45:16] <asurite_warrior> there like a cyber hitch thing that locks on
[0:45:18] <sniffy77> Straps with connectors that sense nerve signals or something
[0:45:20] <EliahNebb> The guns are made of flesh.
[0:45:25] <Goergorion> imagine he just pulls it off and there is a normal hand inside
[0:45:25] <+eanscrale> yeah they kinda dropped the ball on making a lot of the npcs being amputees
[0:45:39] <+rytyoung> Gorilla glue would hold a mounted gun on your arm LUL
[0:45:42] <kentrix11> It follows the enemies so it works.
[0:45:43] <PiCheese> it tracks
[0:45:46] <asurite_warrior> they got some explanation on the old games wiki
[0:45:48] <+justianxix> so it locks on
[0:45:51] <+azure22900> nah it's a really good damage ability
[0:46:06] <Coystick> arm mounted guns are silly wen u think about it
[0:46:12] <+rytyoung> And they cost most from the get go
[0:46:34] <sosuke5> BIG DAMAGE
[0:46:39] <aeonicvector> Damage you'd be willing to go steady with
[0:46:40] <asurite_warrior> apparently in the lore a bunch of dude are missing limbs from the war with Wutai. so prothetics are more common
[0:46:42] <aeonicvector> Kappa
[0:46:44] <mr_slaide> SIGNIFICANT.
[0:46:51] <+rytyoung> I would imagine a single high damage attack
[0:47:12] <aeonicvector> oh yeah, tell us more about the gameplay mechanics, hide boss mechanics imop
[0:47:30] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:47:33] <+rytyoung> @aeonicvector Doom Eternal was the worst offender for that
[0:47:35] <aeonicvector> learning an attacks tell is cool, not knowing if you'll heal sucks
[0:47:46] <mr_slaide> Yeah, waste of sp.
[0:47:52] <mr_slaide> Core 1 is better.
[0:48:05] <cap_bon> your always eating 200 damage attacks
[0:48:23] <kentrix11> There's builds with a looot of defense or magic defense, so I imagine you can do something with low health high defenses to do that.
[0:49:08] <mr_slaide> But you'll recover MP on SIGNIFICANT damage!
[0:49:24] <@dcn2049> she likes leather
[0:49:57] <cap_bon> is emotional damage classed as SIGNIFICANT damage?
[0:50:26] <mr_slaide> Only if it's big emotional damage.
[0:51:52] <Sokumotanaka> That be kinda cool
[0:51:54] <LunarRemix> Who?
[0:52:03] <sniffy77> Horrifying in a good way?
[0:52:22] <+texflexrex> The big rat girl dat makes duh rules
[0:52:23] <cap_bon> Does she make all the rules?
[0:52:26] <%MajorDub> MajorDub subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! resub time. keep on doing your thing.
[0:52:29] <Sokumotanaka> She's als a soldier
[0:52:32] <LunarRemix> Oh yeah Dragon lady I never used because one of her skills kills the entire party.
[0:52:33] <+CrookedSpiral> She's the Dragoon
[0:52:52] <sad_toast_> anti Gravity involved 🤔
[0:53:16] <+texflexrex> Eh it's Mako
[0:53:29] <kentrix11> It also has many points of impact due to the buildings there.
[0:53:34] <Futurecity10> MOMS DEAD KID
[0:53:35] <sad_toast_> mako make it floaty
[0:53:42] <SuperVaderMan> just start over 4Head
[0:53:47] <cap_bon> also you can only compact earth so much so maybe this place is super far down
[0:53:49] <Sokumotanaka> Also that's not an ability of hers @LunarRemix >.>
[0:53:56] <CaptHat211> She's really crying b/c she just read FF7R's changes
[0:54:15] <+mrkisi> @PlagueOfGripes hey plague hope you having a good time, can I ask you what do you think of the game? what your thoughts about it being part 1 of more to come?
[0:54:17] <TheWe4pon> if ya got a hole you got a income source
[0:54:17] <CaptHat211> We ARE stupid, sir!
[0:54:22] <LunarRemix> Sorry, it has been a while since I played FF9 @Sokumotanaka
[0:54:26] <+SweetCheeksPlays> 32 raiders from SweetCheeksPlays have joined! 
[0:54:28] <Sokumotanaka> Anyway ff9 being remade is my biggest fear considering how good the characters are and dont want any stupid ghost shit in
[0:54:29] <%MajorDub> life for rpg npcs must be the worst
[0:54:33] <theriddle22> raid in comming
[0:54:51] <Ninth_Settler> barbRaid
[0:54:56] <Hydrapissed> seems to be a big woof from plague
[0:55:12] <london_flexing> So 6/10
[0:55:13] <ovan20> Barreth is hot, that's Plague's thoughts KappaPride
[0:55:15] <@dcn2049> oh she dead
[0:55:16] <theriddle22> use your legs
[0:55:16] <LunarRemix> Wonder if he will shoot the gate
[0:55:28] <cap_bon> the texture streaming has been very aggressive
[0:55:32] <Hydrapissed> cloud could just throw that
[0:55:42] <@dcn2049> well he's not gonna lift with his gun
[0:55:49] <Hydrapissed> hes a BIG BOI
[0:55:54] <shevan123> hes a damn fine mighty good man
[0:55:54] <$vampireinarm> barret is Hunk HOT
[0:55:55] <LunarRemix> Everyone is hot in this game
[0:55:57] <+LordSDB> Look into Bareet eyes
[0:55:57] <xrolenks> he fucks!
[0:56:02] <LunarRemix> Everyone except Wedge.
[0:56:05] <cap_bon> Hes alright but im more on that Biggs train
[0:56:06] <SuperVaderMan> Legitimately an attractive man
[0:56:14] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> as someone with 3 engineering degrees ehh ask the magic ghosts
[0:56:24] <+justianxix> It looked like it fell in pieces in the cut scene
[0:56:25] <Hydrapissed> cant wait for the barret and cloud animations awww yeh
[0:56:33] <Futurecity10> I want to see Bigg's stain
[0:56:37] <+MrWrann> Does Barret have non-gun attachments or is that just welded on there
[0:56:37] <london_flexing> What section drop on section 7?
[0:56:44] <GeneralSCPatton> So the game has TIME GHOSTS and someone named MARLE?
[0:56:47] <cap_bon> biggs still out there sweeping dirt
[0:56:52] <ovan20> that little girls isn't stronger than tons of rocks falling on her LUL
[0:56:55] <mr_slaide> #metoo
[0:57:12] <Hydrapissed> I mean that would show some good trauma
[0:57:15] <Hydrapissed> have him freaking out
[0:57:21] <Futurecity10> I find it funny that on the podcast, woolie was making constant FF7 Abridged references and pat never saw the show
[0:57:29] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wedge had to eat his cats to survive
[0:57:43] <+justianxix> Pat never saw the Abridged?
[0:57:50] <TheWe4pon> soooooo are we on top of the plate right now?
[0:57:52] <Futurecity10> I thought biggs was the fat guy
[0:58:00] <Hydrapissed> wedge is being eaten
[0:58:00] <mr_slaide> HAHA
[0:58:01] <TheWe4pon> how the fuck?
[0:58:11] <mr_slaide> Yop
[0:58:27] <LunarRemix> Weird camera on her tits there.
[0:58:40] <mr_slaide> They're eating Wedge!
[0:58:42] <Sol_Install> that wedge getting eaten
[0:58:47] <cap_bon> good thing the rubble was already on fire
[0:58:47] <Hydrapissed> hes WEDGED in there real tight
[0:58:50] <Sokumotanaka> THANK GOD IT'S OKAY
[0:58:55] <Hydrapissed> the crazy cat lady worked on this
[0:59:01] <BTRNDL> cats look better than npcs pvpSK
[0:59:05] <kentrix11> They look better than some npc
[0:59:09] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wedge looked so weird in this game. Must suck to be the 1/3 fat people to exist in midgar
[0:59:11] <+justianxix> Developer's love making detailed Cats
[0:59:13] <Final_Cosplay_Corps> i feel there should be more fires.
[0:59:18] <rothgarbloodfire> monsterhunter face tech?
[0:59:19] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It still baffles me that Shinra though THIS was an acceptable financial the best way to get rid of 6 people.
[0:59:22] <$vampireinarm> the fact that anything is still standing is nuts
[0:59:32] <TheWe4pon> we saw her die, and biggs
[0:59:34] <ScreamLord> *financial loss
[0:59:39] <Hydrapissed> well "Die"
[0:59:44] <Hydrapissed> they kinda passed out
[1:00:04] <TheWe4pon> wasnt wedge being held captive by time ghosts?
[1:00:11] <silvcrest> yes
[1:00:14] <mr_slaide> Wtf
[1:00:22] <Sol_Install> yes
[1:00:24] <+datmegamandeeeee> Wedge ate jessie
[1:00:26] <red_blaster> I though she said "Is this really all that is left of Wedge?", like it was just a puddle of blood
[1:00:29] <cap_bon> did wedge eat his way to safety
[1:00:29] <+MrWrann> Why even have Wedge live.
[1:00:30] <+datmegamandeeeee> To live
[1:00:42] <Frankomancer> is this before or after the point that wedge should have died?
[1:00:49] <cap_bon> after
[1:00:52] <%CyberDingus> "rain of corpses'' is pretty metal
[1:00:52] <Frankomancer> in the og game i mean
[1:00:53] <TheWe4pon> this whole situation if bothering me so fucking much.
[1:00:56] <$vampireinarm> if the debri didnt kill them the explosions and shockwaves shoulda have
[1:01:03] <mr_slaide> Wtf is this?
[1:01:03] <Frankomancer> WHY
[1:01:14] <cap_bon> wedge was a red cloud at this point
[1:01:19] <Frankomancer> WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST MAKE A SIMPLE REMAKE
[1:01:27] <Frankomancer> Dont add shit
[1:01:33] <mr_slaide> YOU LOVE IT!
[1:01:33] <+datmegamandeeeee> The pollution woulda killed the surrounding towns. Upper and lower
[1:01:37] <+justianxix> Barret time
[1:01:42] <+samirrsp> But is barret content LUL
[1:01:45] <$vampireinarm> if this upsets you youre gonna HATE the last third of the game @Frankomancer
[1:01:51] <%CyberDingus> WE ARE BIG BLACK MAN NOW
[1:01:51] <ovan20> we can't have death in our multi million dollar franchise man, it has to be wholesome terrorism Kappa
[1:01:53] <%CyberDingus> REJOICE
[1:01:58] <mr_slaide> BEHOLD
[1:01:58] <%bettysharkface> Hullo
[1:02:02] <+justianxix> just shoot it LUL
[1:02:03] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Any excavated areas under the Section 7 Slums should have caved in when a 1000000000000000 Ton plate of metal fell on top of it
[1:02:08] <+MrWrann> So he could do this whenever, but just doesnt want to
[1:02:10] <Hydrapissed> shovel MAN
[1:02:11] <CaptHat211> Barret looks like he's wearing a mech's leg for a right arm.
[1:02:15] <+texflexrex> Big bullets
[1:02:17] <Hydrapissed> give cloud a freaking shovel sword
[1:02:24] <ovan20> you are also forbidden to jump them LUL
[1:02:25] <%CyberDingus> buy some watermelon juice
[1:02:25] <Basteksamplastek> explasive rounds ?
[1:02:26] <Frankomancer> i havent even played any of the original game beyond Red 13's home area and im very pissed @vampireinarm
[1:02:30] <%CyberDingus> gotta keep yourself watered up
[1:02:36] <%caramello_man> look guys this is a video game, not real life, physics only exists when they want it to
[1:02:49] <Hydrapissed> awww yeh
[1:02:53] <GeneralSCPatton> This Nomura move is actually kind of brilliant. The thing people always wanted most was a way to save or resurrect Aeris. Time ghost bullshit gives an interesting avenue to do that with extra consequences.
[1:02:55] <+MrWrann> Do they ever explain where Barret gets and keeps all his ammo
[1:03:04] <Futurecity10> SUPPRESSING FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE
[1:03:07] <Hydrapissed> a little
[1:03:14] <Sol_Install> yea bit
[1:03:16] <$daveronald> electric bugaboos
[1:03:16] <ovan20> no
[1:03:17] <%bettysharkface> It is a racist term
[1:03:19] <%CyberDingus> @MrWrann he is an Ork in disguise.
[1:03:20] <london_flexing> Isn't it?
[1:03:21] <CaptHat211> Jigaboo is the racial term
[1:03:23] <%CyberDingus> he BELIEVES in ammo!
[1:03:24] <Explodincatz> anything can be a racial term
[1:03:24] <+justianxix> maybe old time racist
[1:03:25] <+Jumpie8> bless you
[1:03:25] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> bless you
[1:03:29] <%MajorDub> well, moon cricket and chocolate cricket are pejoratives
[1:03:29] <arran_throttle> everything is racist today
[1:03:32] <Futurecity10> Bugaboo is a dutch company
[1:03:35] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Goddamn Bugaboos comin' here and taken out jobs
[1:03:37] <Hydrapissed> its pretty fun
[1:03:41] <notanegg8> die bugaboos
[1:03:43] <+CrookedSpiral> kill the boxes!
[1:03:44] <Sol_Install> Berret the best part
[1:03:50] <SuperVaderMan> Impossible, having fun in FF7 remake
[1:03:50] <+MrWrann> B6? Dude fell 5 stories and just got up.
[1:03:53] <scribbledguy> @PlagueOfGripes gesundheit
[1:03:53] <+justianxix> Barret Chapter Best Chapter
[1:03:54] <+datmegamandeeeee> lol
[1:03:54] <cap_bon> and it is fun
[1:03:56] <%Samex_Comex> Yay fuck'em up Barret!
[1:04:11] <sniffy77> Omgtheres so many boxes
[1:04:13] <Futurecity10> God Barrets cool
[1:04:18] <$Rivalshotzgp> Isn’t this that bad ff7 spin-off gameplay?
[1:04:20] <+Punishedkaiger> MR T PITY A BOX
[1:04:20] <LunarRemix> So instead of shooting that gate he's going to shoot boxes huh
[1:04:23] <Hydrapissed> can I watch
[1:04:30] <$vampireinarm> thats speciest Barret
[1:04:34] <cap_bon> jesus even the rats do 140 damage
[1:04:40] <Hydrapissed> overkill is underrated
[1:04:40] <Sol_Install> do it
[1:04:44] <Sol_Install> NO MERCY
[1:04:45] <eyezehuhh> jigaboo is an actual racist term
[1:04:50] <xrolenks> bout to murder its bloodline
[1:04:53] <%caramello_man> pls miss
[1:04:57] <%MajorDub> overkill em once, the job is done
[1:04:58] <SuperVaderMan> This is just Barret's day-to-day. He does this all the time, living his best life
[1:04:59] <Hydrapissed> HE WON
[1:05:02] <+datmegamandeeeee> Maybe these boxes have valuable items 😏 shoot them all slowly to find out
[1:05:02] <%Samex_Comex> I want one
[1:05:04] <GeneralSCPatton> @hydrapissed underkill is overrated
[1:05:05] <Futurecity10> Reminds me of that Boondocks song
[1:05:06] <%CyberDingus> meanwhile Barret has a GOOD TIME
[1:05:06] <SuperVaderMan> very good Barret
[1:05:11] <notanegg8> LITERALLY NOBODY IS AROUND BARRET
[1:05:15] <Hydrapissed> @GeneralSCPatton now ya got it
[1:05:17] <+texflexrex> he just loves the planet so much
[1:05:20] <+justianxix> Barret is so wholesome
[1:05:22] <ScreamLord> I wish Barret sang the entire victory tune
[1:05:25] <$vampireinarm> he does it for himself
[1:05:27] <+MrWrann> Leave one box as a warning
[1:05:27] <LokimenD> Barret is the best
[1:05:36] <Sokumotanaka> Wouldnt you?
[1:05:47] <BTRNDL> just barret in his natural habitat
[1:06:16] <ovan20> this is why Barreth doesn't have a wife. When she asked for him to open a pickle jar, he shot it open Keepo
[1:06:16] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It would appear Wedge knew and then told NO ONE
[1:06:16] <red_blaster> This is Sector 0, right? The one from Dirge of Cerberus that was under the slums?
[1:06:22] <Sol_Install> Barrets ablilties are so damn good
[1:06:38] <LunarRemix> No, Sector 0 is a super advanced training facility @red_blaster
[1:06:40] <Hydrapissed> oh no wedge is a TIME AGENT
[1:06:42] <Hydrapissed> he knows all
[1:06:43] <TheWe4pon> Keep movin buggaboo this here a white neighborhood.
[1:06:58] <@dcn2049> "haha wedge fat hahaha"
[1:06:58] <Flamethrowerman09> F.A.T.
[1:07:06] <Hydrapissed> japan hates the fats
[1:07:09] <Sol_Install> that's japan
[1:07:10] <%Samex_Comex> Leave Wedge alone!
[1:07:13] <ScreamLord> Wasn't that basically Wedge's trope in the OG FF7 too?
[1:07:28] <+justianxix> Well, wedge is pretty cool tho, especially in the remake
[1:07:33] <LunarRemix> I think he didn't even had a trope because there was just so little of avalanche in the original
[1:07:38] <kentrix11> Man the only parts I liked with Wedge were when they highlight how much of a bro he is when shit hits the fan.
[1:07:47] <Hydrapissed> the chamer is a side ways 8 plague
[1:07:48] <+CrookedSpiral> blood
[1:07:49] <Hydrapissed> dont cha know
[1:07:52] <Hydrapissed> chamber*
[1:07:52] <TheWe4pon> It runs on anger
[1:07:52] <Sokumotanaka> Mako power?
[1:07:53] <+eanscrale> Lead materia I guess
[1:07:53] <%bettysharkface> It is fueled by shit talking and rage
[1:07:56] <%caramello_man> it's pneumatic
[1:07:56] <kentrix11> Bullets made out of mana?
[1:07:57] <Explodincatz> its a Spiral Gun
[1:07:59] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It runs on fight spirit and anger
[1:08:00] <%Samex_Comex> Rage bullets
[1:08:05] <mield916> shoots his bones
[1:08:10] <%MajorDub> well, that's how vegeta turned ssj
[1:08:10] <+azure22900> runs on semen probably due to how big his balls are
[1:08:12] <%MajorDub> rocks
[1:08:15] <@dcn2049> It runs on pure Barret juice
[1:08:25] <$Rivalshotzgp> It is unlikely to run on mako either though due to his beliefs
[1:08:29] <GeneralSCPatton> @eanscrale Makes as much sense as anything. Lead is an element.
[1:08:34] <+justianxix> Magic bullets?
[1:08:38] <Hydrapissed> its the bosses gun
[1:08:40] <+texflexrex> a recycle gun...
[1:08:53] <fluffy_sauce> you missed a couple of boxes
[1:08:54] <Hydrapissed> hey its bloodborne
[1:09:01] <%bettysharkface> Oh god
[1:09:05] <%bettysharkface> I hate that
[1:09:06] <ScreamLord> Projectile Anger
[1:09:08] <+justianxix> how metal
[1:09:08] <%bettysharkface> Please stop
[1:09:12] <sniffy77> Each bullet is a cell
[1:09:15] <@dcn2049> haha
[1:09:17] <+texflexrex> i mean, there is iron in blood
[1:09:21] <Sokumotanaka> Plauge stop making him cooler
[1:09:21] <+HawkGoggles2> Especially you Cloud. Just think of you could make me shoot all day.
[1:09:23] <$Rivalshotzgp> The bullets are magnetized to go back in the magazine
[1:09:25] <sniffy77> A cell being fired super fast
[1:09:36] <LunarRemix> It would be funnier is he didn't know how it works
[1:09:39] <@dcn2049> Nice stunlocking gun
[1:09:41] <Explodincatz> DESTROYED
[1:09:52] <ScreamLord> That rat is now ground beef
[1:09:55] <Hydrapissed> STAGGER that dogo
[1:09:55] <kentrix11> This game can be a real nightmare when playing with a single character.
[1:09:59] <%MajorDub> are we re-writing the canon so that barret is an edgelord now?
[1:10:02] <GeneralSCPatton> BUST THIS BORK!
[1:10:24] <+justianxix> WANT SOME MORE
[1:10:25] <LunarRemix> They are problably working for Shinra.
[1:10:37] <thesoothe> 95% hit chance.
[1:10:55] <%bettysharkface> He's always so proud of himself though. Doesn't matter what he does, he's pleased as punch that he did it
[1:11:09] <Hydrapissed> 10 damage
[1:11:10] <Hydrapissed> LOL
[1:11:15] <Hydrapissed> KILL IT
[1:11:16] <TheWe4pon> Is it just me or is this game only good when barret is around?
[1:11:17] <%MajorDub> well, he's angry, uses his blood as a weapon now; all he needs is a wardrobe change
[1:11:17] <Sokumotanaka> Tifa and Cloud did NOT fall all the way down here
[1:11:17] <+justianxix> LUL
[1:11:18] <fluffy_sauce> that was self defense
[1:11:23] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I just noticed that Big Bertha has a revolver chamber...It's a full auto Revolver canon
[1:11:36] <Hydrapissed> 10 damage and then barret responds with
[1:11:42] <Hydrapissed> BRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTT
[1:11:45] <notanegg8> why is the game like twice as funny when it's just barret?
[1:12:03] <%bettysharkface> Barret should have been the main character
[1:12:35] <Hydrapissed> lol
[1:12:40] <Hydrapissed> TARGET DOWN
[1:12:43] <%MajorDub> gonna give man's best friend MAN'S BEST END
[1:12:45] <Sol_Install> Maximum Fury is the best shit
[1:12:46] <kentrix11> I'm dying here
[1:12:48] <LunarRemix> He's doing it more often now that's alone wtf
[1:12:55] <%JailShmixRemix> Oh barret
[1:12:55] <ScreamLord> Barret: SO I fired, but I missed
[1:12:57] <cap_bon> pressure dat doggo to the grave
[1:12:57] <notanegg8> HE'S ALONE IN A SEWER ANNIHILATING DOGS AND SINGING TO HIMSELF
[1:13:02] <+Punishedkaiger> So this is the FF7R redemption chapter, with playable barret being fun as hell
[1:13:05] <Sokumotanaka> I hope yuffie also sings the victory anthem
[1:13:20] <Hydrapissed> Pressure raining down on me under pressure
[1:13:25] <sniffy77> This is barretts side job as a exterminator
[1:13:32] <red_blaster> He sure is happy. And his friends just died a minute ago!
[1:13:35] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It's a projectile based meat grinder
[1:13:36] <Canadian312> livin' the life
[1:13:38] <kingra> Barret is insane
[1:13:44] <+justianxix> What cute things can the other new party members do in the next game?
[1:14:01] <MrHappyFunshine> Barret: YEAH I LOVE SHOOTING THESE DOGS, REMINDS ME OF HOME
[1:14:07] <notanegg8> this is the hardest i've laughed in a while
[1:14:10] <Hydrapissed> what
[1:14:11] <%MajorDub> remember when you went crazy shooting boxes?
[1:14:16] <%MajorDub> insane 1, sane 0
[1:14:31] <SuperVaderMan> like a weird double necklace
[1:14:59] <GeneralSCPatton> Geez, I haven't seen the word carcanet since some obscure D&D magic item.
[1:15:15] <theredfox930000> hey plague hope your doing good brother
[1:15:17] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes God I wish Accessories appeared on the character Models just so I coul see Barret wearing that Carcanet on his big, meaty man neck
[1:15:21] <LunarRemix> Def.
[1:15:27] <GeneralSCPatton> Is Vit Def?
[1:15:35] <%MajorDub> @ScreamLord he'd still be killin' it
[1:17:05] <cap_bon> Millions have died and countless more are screaming out under rubble. Barret singing as he guns down dogs in a sewer
[1:17:09] <@dcn2049> Maximum fury is awesome
[1:17:24] <Sol_Install> it's really good
[1:17:46] <Sokumotanaka> Yeah agreed
[1:17:51] <Sol_Install> 100%
[1:17:51] <+justianxix> Its mainly to have you switch party members more
[1:18:05] <+justianxix> But yeah, its excessive
[1:18:12] <cap_bon> Help me mommy is stuck under this rock. Barret: Yeah suck it doggos
[1:18:15] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes If you could wiggle out of command grabs without party members that would mitigate a lot of the tedium of them
[1:18:51] <@dcn2049> If something is tedious, it shouldn't be in any form of entertainment
[1:19:09] <Sokumotanaka> thats because tifa is weak
[1:19:11] <kentrix11> I don't think it's that bad because you can just change characters.
[1:19:19] <ScreamLord> Good thing ricocheting bullets isn't a thing
[1:19:27] <kentrix11> It kinda encourages you to change characters even.
[1:19:35] <arkv01> button masher minigames are designed to destroy your controller and make you go buy a new one $$$
[1:19:40] <kentrix11> Which is why it's a nightmare having one character.
[1:19:45] <sniffy77> Thats the kill button
[1:19:52] <%MajorDub> they knew exactly what they were doing when they called that move "Maximum Fury"
[1:19:57] <kingra> Barret is the best
[1:20:14] <kingra> This is how Barret should be
[1:20:28] <ScreamLord> Are there any more Limit Breaks or is it just the ones each character starts with?
[1:20:53] <silvcrest> you can unlock more I think
[1:21:17] <+cylish> anyone know of a setting that would affect hair textures or character sharpness on ps4 pro? all the streamers Ive been watching have way better looking characters on screen than mine and its bothering me
[1:21:25] <sniffy77> Plague, have you heard that the Halo TV show is gonna have a character thats a human orphan raised by the Covenant to hate humans?
[1:22:12] <+cylish> Plague it just adds it to the list when you gain a limitbreak in battle if the materia is equiped
[1:22:16] <ScreamLord> @sniffy77 That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard
[1:22:38] <rubbishbinge> finishing touch?
[1:22:47] <silvcrest> you have to unlock them in the arena
[1:22:53] <%MajorDub> insane 2, sane 0
[1:23:09] <LunarRemix> Did you ever keep it at level 1?
[1:23:30] <Sokumotanaka> HOW DID SHE FALL DOWN HERE SO FAR!?
[1:23:45] <sniffy77> I think they're only doing it because alien characters cost money, so just have a human dress in purple and call them the covenant
[1:24:01] <notanegg8> "i hope that killed a few dogs too at least"
[1:24:02] <%Samex_Comex> Kill them with your rage
[1:24:31] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes If Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge survive Midgar I going to put Aerith surviving as a strong maybe
[1:24:38] <%MajorDub> bugs are icky
[1:25:00] <%Samex_Comex> You ever punch a bunch of bugs
[1:26:42] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes and don't forget how Cloud could heal two people with potions, but he wasted times instead listening to them.
[1:26:44] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes It's like a self-indulgent fanfiction but the author is one of the original writters
[1:26:55] <london_flexing> Thats a shonen trope tho
[1:27:04] <+silvery_cricket> Nomura designed background characters for the original FF7
[1:27:08] <examplez0> Galuf
[1:27:08] <$vampireinarm> dont use a pheonix down on aerith either
[1:27:09] <MiskatonicAlum> galuf?
[1:27:09] <+CrookedSpiral> Tellah
[1:27:13] <$vampireinarm> thatve be wasteful
[1:27:15] <fluffy_sauce> in FF5?
[1:27:17] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:27:18] <LunarRemix> Samurai guy?
[1:27:19] <Explodincatz> like me
[1:27:26] <sniffy77> It will be weird if they have say, another character than Aerith die
[1:27:27] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura designed all the characters in the original FF7
[1:27:31] <+Punishedkaiger> plagueFace_EG
[1:27:33] <CaptHat211> How can anyone be upset about Aerith dying when Tifa is there?
[1:27:34] <%Samex_Comex> I know that website
[1:27:42] <silvcrest> Galuf wad the best
[1:27:43] <kingra> Red 19 Dies
[1:27:46] <+justianxix> LUL
[1:27:47] <+silvery_cricket> Shit your right
[1:27:47] <%CyberDingus> WELL YEAH I DID, FOOL
[1:27:49] <arkv01> duh bullets tifa
[1:27:49] <fluffy_sauce> no all the characters that die in FF4 come back to life at the end of the game
[1:27:51] <%MajorDub> bitch, you just saw him shoot the fans
[1:27:59] <CaptHat211> He's gotta point, Tifa.
[1:27:59] <Sokumotanaka> Eh mob doens't have to be about murder though it's about change and change means something. I've seen a billion stories where a character can die and when they die the development stops so I disagree here at least
[1:28:08] <$vampireinarm> shes got a win quote where her voice acctress's voice comes out real hard
[1:28:09] <Fry_guy0> whats the point of having a machine gun arm if you don't use it?
[1:28:11] <notanegg8> in my book, backing out on character death is super cowardly and usually meaningless
[1:28:14] <+silvery_cricket> For real question how does everyone feel about Barret's arm sock
[1:28:15] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I mean...it did work
[1:28:37] <+justianxix> 30 minute of stairs?
[1:28:38] <+azure22900> who knows
[1:28:39] <rubbishbinge> The stairs are pretty fun
[1:28:41] <$vampireinarm> the arm socks lets them avoid the question had earlier about how the guns attach to him or how it works
[1:28:54] <+Punishedkaiger> It did so much damage holy shit
[1:28:57] <+silvery_cricket> I think its kinda distacting
[1:29:09] <ScreamLord> It's like a DMC gun juggling mechanic
[1:29:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> Protip: To be the Cyberdemon as Barrett, shoot at everything until they die.
[1:29:24] <VeryTricky> !uptime
[1:29:24] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 29 minutes 36 seconds
[1:29:27] <%Samex_Comex> More boxes!
[1:29:29] <%MajorDub> this should be a gun nut's ultimate fantasy
[1:29:35] <%MajorDub> all problems solved by shooting stuff
[1:29:36] <notanegg8> why is he shouting at the boxes
[1:29:41] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[1:29:42] <arkv01> watch barret take his girl
[1:30:12] <%Samex_Comex> Why are the boxes in cages?
[1:30:15] <xeros720> yeah, this sequence is real good
[1:30:20] <xrolenks> hell house boss sucked so much
[1:30:26] <ahaegotrigger> True
[1:30:36] <CaptHat211> I suspect some art of Barret in the near future
[1:30:37] <+justianxix> I thought Hell house was a great boss, right amount of difficulty
[1:30:38] <Explodincatz> ice
[1:30:45] <xrolenks> who even knows
[1:30:50] <sniffy77> Ice ice barret
[1:30:54] <Hydrapissed> I mean just hit it with an ele that its weak to and its done so idk hell house was meh
[1:30:55] <+silvery_cricket> Hell House sucks
[1:30:57] <notanegg8> countless scores of people died but we made some funny barret jokes. so it's impossible to tell if it was good or not
[1:31:01] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes what is the other materia?
[1:31:17] <+azure22900> warding
[1:31:29] <Explodincatz> whats warding do?
[1:31:34] <+justianxix> Its a mechanic that appears in every FF game, I just think they did it alright
[1:31:40] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Barret: "When life gives obstacles, the answer is "Gun". And if that doesn't solve it, use more Gun."
[1:31:44] <+azure22900> reduce negative effect time
[1:32:57] <MrHappyFunshine> I've been very vocal about disliking them completely ignoring the point of the original character deaths, it is a shame really.
[1:32:59] <Ralfclogs> “I really wish this was better” like the game
[1:33:05] <+silvery_cricket> Which versions of the characters are more honest to their original depictions Remake or Abridged?
[1:33:29] <ScreamLord> Remake
[1:33:33] <+azure22900> remake, abridged is a cartoon
[1:33:52] <+silvery_cricket> I think Abridged Cloud is closer to his original
[1:34:07] <+silvery_cricket> because he is trying to act cool to a absurd degree
[1:34:08] <examplez0> One of the few things the remake does right is the portrayal of the original characters
[1:34:10] <+justianxix> I feel the Abridged is just a little to exaggerated. They got real close tho
[1:34:11] <%Samex_Comex> Where's Sweepy
[1:34:24] <examplez0> It does a far better job than the rest of the compilation for sure
[1:34:33] <+azure22900> remake is the closest cloud
[1:34:57] <+silvery_cricket> Remake makes Cloud seem like everyones buying it to bit
[1:35:00] <examplez0> Abridged does a better job than Advent Children, Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core but that ain't saying much
[1:35:22] <+silvery_cricket> Like Cloud is the type that looks for something to lean on when he walks into a room to seem cool.
[1:35:37] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes As far as story and world settings, which is your favorite Final Fantasy?
[1:35:37] <Explodincatz> i dislike Cloud so yea this is better
[1:35:37] <+justianxix> Tho some side characters and party members in the abridged like Vincent seem a little to one-note and joke personality
[1:35:38] <Hydrapissed> HA
[1:35:40] <Hydrapissed> F at
[1:35:43] <%CyberDingus> FAT JOKE
[1:35:44] <silvcrest> do you want me to copy info on how synergy works?
[1:35:56] <kentrix11> They expect you to use counter and the parry materia I think? Because some boss fights get much better with the parry materia.
[1:35:56] <MrHappyFunshine> The actual characterisation of the characters is the best it has been in this game, except Sephiroth
[1:36:09] <examplez0> @ScreamLord he said FF7 is his favourite in one of his earlier streams
[1:36:10] <+justianxix> Truly wholesome
[1:36:17] <arkv01> time ghosts should kill cloud off and make barret our guy
[1:36:18] <ScreamLord> Oh
[1:36:20] <+silvery_cricket> Like Cloud leans to look cool, but doesnt lean and looks cool.
[1:36:20] <Sokumotanaka> @PlagueOfGripes Would you have a drink with barret?
[1:36:55] <OToole42> dakka dakka
[1:37:03] <examplez0> @MrHappyFunshine Yeah I really didn't like the way they kept shoving Sephiroth in your face almost immediately after the bombing mission
[1:37:24] <+silvery_cricket> Because Nomura isnt subtle
[1:37:30] <sosuke5> We terrorizes, because he cares
[1:37:32] <arkv01> I think it's fine for games to be enjoyable
[1:37:40] <Hydrapissed> I mean is there an ez setting?
[1:37:41] <saddlezilla1> Maybe also it's additional content instead of vast changed content?
[1:37:46] <Sokumotanaka> LUL You right
[1:37:57] <Explodincatz> so baba
[1:37:58] <%Samex_Comex> Hurt me game make me feel
[1:38:04] <ScreamLord> I want a game to be fun, not just challenging or "difficult"
[1:38:09] <Sokumotanaka> Would a can or raid kill these things?
[1:38:12] <+justianxix> Eh, feels like different strokes for different folks
[1:38:13] <+silvery_cricket> A game should have some difficulty, because that makes there be joy from overcoming a problem. yet when you demand that a game be fuck you hard then your now the problem.
[1:38:24] <MrHappyFunshine> I like a challenge but there is a difference between a challenge and a chore
[1:38:31] <Hydrapissed> huge man
[1:38:32] <arkv01> oh no barret toe dogs
[1:38:33] <%MajorDub> that's an image
[1:38:38] <@dcn2049> jumbo links
[1:38:39] <examplez0> All games need multiple difficulty settings
[1:38:41] <Frankomancer> dont talk about Barret's toes please
[1:38:46] <kentrix11> A game can be fun without challenge, it can also be fun with challenge it's not like one depends on the other.
[1:38:50] <Explodincatz> i like to think the bench could just break at any point with him
[1:38:51] <+silvery_cricket> Barret's toes are also guns
[1:38:53] <+Punishedkaiger> Everything is too small for barret
[1:39:04] <Kampler21> Ello chat
[1:39:15] <arkv01> maybe barret is just doing a sitting squat and not putting any weight on the bench at all
[1:39:23] <+Punishedkaiger> Imagine the size of his penis, it must be like a baseball bat
[1:39:24] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I bet they made that Hip Hop mix of the Chocobo theme shitty on purpose
[1:39:26] <kentrix11> An easy game isn't very saisfactory like a hard game can be though.
[1:39:31] <+silvery_cricket> The bench is to intimidated to break.
[1:39:41] <kentrix11> I really like those music covers.
[1:39:48] <MrHappyFunshine> As a man with size 13 feet, they are kinda like short bratwurst
[1:39:48] <arkv01> I remember reading the OST for this is 7 discs somewhere
[1:39:50] <saddlezilla1> random, but does anyone feel the dynamic between Cloud trying to be cool was kinda lost even in OG because at a certain point, he legitimately DOES become really cool?
[1:40:00] <arkv01> symbolism, but yeah lotta tracks no doubt
[1:40:05] <+silvery_cricket> Yeah but that is earned
[1:40:15] <+silvery_cricket> HE IS OKAY
[1:40:16] <+silvery_cricket> HOW
[1:40:17] <+justianxix> The cats
[1:40:18] <Explodincatz> shut up
[1:40:19] <Sol_Install> that's a good question
[1:40:19] <arkv01> he's OKAY?
[1:40:19] <TheWe4pon> FOR FUCKS SAKE
[1:40:20] <Sol_Install> how?
[1:40:22] <notanegg8> making sure a challenge is engaging and rewarding instead of being just a needless roadblock to success seems like one of those subtly difficult balances to strike during game development
[1:40:22] <Frankomancer> why isnt there any rumble around him
[1:40:27] <Sokumotanaka> How did tifa get where SHE was??
[1:40:28] <Frankomancer> rubble
[1:40:32] <ScreamLord> The Cats
[1:40:32] <cyberblueneon> the meme of cloud not being cool is bullcrap, he is obviously a cool character
[1:40:33] <@dcn2049> he bounced into it
[1:40:34] <Futurecity10> time ghosts
[1:40:36] <sniffy77> Didn't he get crushed
[1:40:38] <arkv01> was it the FUCKING time ghosts again
[1:40:41] <SuperVaderMan> He got trapped under rubble and ate his way down
[1:40:42] <Sol_Install> no that dumb
[1:40:44] <+HawkGoggles2> The cats dragged his fatass the whole way.
[1:40:50] <Kampler21> Time jannies dragging him
[1:40:53] <+silvery_cricket> Cloud is cool but he is cool because he learns that being cool is not pretending to be cool
[1:41:03] <Frankomancer> careful with those grenades on his belt, Barret
[1:41:03] <%Samex_Comex> Nice and heavy
[1:41:04] <examplez0> So glad the fat hungry character survived but not the one with an actual backstory and relation with Cloud
[1:41:06] <fluffy_sauce> omg, i hate this
[1:41:07] <+silvery_cricket> as opposed to Advent Children where he is COOOL
[1:41:09] <+Punishedkaiger> The rubble must've missed him just slightly, but then broke the earth into the tunnels
[1:41:15] <Sokumotanaka> So is cait gonna look like a real cat?
[1:41:20] <notanegg8> it begins.
[1:41:24] <arkv01> kid's got a good pair of eyes
[1:41:25] <+silvery_cricket> BIO MEN
[1:41:26] <CaptHat211> That's adorable.
[1:41:26] <+justianxix> SourPls
[1:41:29] <Explodincatz> VENOM
[1:41:29] <@dcn2049> what the hell
[1:41:34] <%caramello_man> heartless
[1:41:35] <Frankomancer> ITS THE HEARTLESS
[1:41:36] <Fry_guy0> heartless?
[1:41:38] <Sokumotanaka> ASTRAL CHAIN!?
[1:41:38] <Fry_guy0> lol
[1:41:40] <GeltonZ> OHJ! Sahagins?
[1:41:46] <rubbishbinge> street sharks
[1:41:47] <Johnmaddened> more unknown entities, oh goody
[1:41:49] <+LordSDB> How is wedge alive with those things around?
[1:41:50] <GeltonZ> They kinda look like edgy Sahagins
[1:41:53] <%CyberDingus> meeeeeeeee
[1:41:54] <arkv01> devilmen crybabies?
[1:41:58] <+silvery_cricket> Every part of this game that doesn't have his balls wiped on them are good
[1:41:58] <Rodzzila> We have purposely make the song irritating, as a joke
[1:41:58] <kentrix11> Those are kinda like the monsters from the tubes in nibelheim no?
[1:42:01] <MiskatonicAlum> theyre actually not
[1:42:05] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> octoThicc
[1:42:09] <MiskatonicAlum> @kentrix11 bingo
[1:42:12] <kentrix11> They are not cartonish enough.
[1:42:14] <OToole42> look at the windmill run
[1:42:16] <arkv01> no heartless have waaaay less polygons LUL
[1:42:21] <KitsuneManami> Plague has your brain had any time skip where a cahracter explains something and you blank out since Aerith talked about Cloud being a body guard? :P
[1:42:22] <+justianxix> There design is real different
[1:42:23] <mark1247> THEY LOOK LIKE unverse from KINGDOM HEARTS!
[1:42:24] <%Samex_Comex> Guyver?
[1:42:25] <Sokumotanaka> Nomura be like "I like warframe"
[1:42:31] <mark1247> not the heartless
[1:42:36] <+silvery_cricket> OMG LOOK HOW THEY RUN
[1:42:41] <GeltonZ> Putties!
[1:42:42] <Fry_guy0> they even fight like the heartless wtf
[1:42:43] <+silvery_cricket> THEY EVEN RUN LIKE HEARTLESS
[1:42:43] <LunarRemix> You should probably assesss them
[1:42:49] <arkv01> nomura fully expects fans to put tits and asses on these things
[1:42:52] <+HawkGoggles2> When I think of neo shadows they do look more like the edgy, strong heartless.
[1:42:54] <saddlezilla1> @silvery_cricket I actually never had a problem w/ how 'cool' he was in AC, cuz it never felt like he was trying to be cool. my problem was how badly they depicted depression and mental health.
[1:42:56] <@dcn2049> They seem to be weak to bullets
[1:42:58] <+justianxix> Man, I love this theme
[1:43:14] <Sokumotanaka> God they do move like heartless, nomura you fool...
[1:43:15] <Sol_Install> She would be way cooler
[1:43:17] <@dcn2049> gun breasts
[1:43:19] <Johnmaddened> she'd be bayonetta
[1:43:21] <Explodincatz> what if her tits were guns
[1:43:22] <notanegg8> tifa's got all the guns she needs right there
[1:43:26] <%Samex_Comex> Shotgun legs
[1:43:28] <+silvery_cricket> Advent Children Cloud is Cool because they looked at the COOL chart, not because he earns it.
[1:43:28] <arkv01> ballistics, you say
[1:43:29] <Frankomancer> Just like the heartless, they just stand there and dont do anything during fights
[1:43:41] <@dcn2049> Just make a new character entirely out of guns
[1:43:50] <+silvery_cricket> USE YOUR KEYBLADE
[1:43:51] <Frankomancer> look at them just run around
[1:43:53] <%caramello_man> omg this IS the next kingdom hearts!
[1:43:55] <kentrix11> Those tentacles they have in their back do look kinda like the antenas regular shadows have, they are kinda cute.
[1:43:58] <Sokumotanaka> Is this a ploy to have cloud save the day cause they can't do anything wtihout him?
[1:43:58] <Frankomancer> they arent even trying
[1:44:27] <arkv01> oh ok, jenova mutants
[1:44:28] <LunarRemix> Jenova probably
[1:44:31] <rubbishbinge> yep
[1:44:35] <+silvery_cricket> Same as Cloud
[1:44:39] <arkv01> cool I guess, but thats a LOT more jenova cells running amok
[1:44:41] <+silvery_cricket> This is what Cloud is
[1:44:44] <examplez0> Maybe they're leftovers from SOLDIER experiments?
[1:44:49] <CaptHat211> Transplants from shut-up.
[1:44:51] <saddlezilla1> @PlagueOfGripes do u want to REALLY HATE these guys Plague? They're underground. Deep below. One would almost say - DeepGround...
[1:44:52] <rubbishbinge> deadly dodge?
[1:44:54] <kentrix11> Thye stay in place when they cast spells.
[1:44:56] <SuperVaderMan> "They rarely get interrupted" that's just every enemy though LUL
[1:44:59] <@dcn2049> you've destroyed 14 already. These are shitty experiments
[1:45:04] <+silvery_cricket> OH FUCK THEY ARE DEEP GROUND
[1:45:08] <Frankomancer> look at them skidaddle
[1:45:08] <examplez0> They're what Cloud would have turned into if he wasn't rescued by Zack
[1:45:09] <+silvery_cricket> THATS DUMB
[1:45:09] <MrHappyFunshine> They look too ornate, i remember those disgusting tube bois in Nibelheim being worse off
[1:45:21] <OToole42> the Shinra version of human baking soda volcanoes
[1:45:23] <arkv01> nah fuck the time ghosts collapsed deepground, doesn't exist anymore LUL
[1:45:25] <Johnmaddened> it sure is LUL
[1:45:26] <arkv01> no dirge, no cerberus
[1:45:27] <examplez0> Oh god no
[1:45:30] <sniffy77> Yeah it is pretty rediculous
[1:45:50] <MiskatonicAlum> nibelheim was also an older reactor, so the experiments inside would be shittier "please kill me"-types
[1:45:53] <+silvery_cricket> WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE TIME GHOSTS FOR THIS SHIT
[1:46:00] <CaptHat211> Barret with the save
[1:46:00] <+justianxix> Teamwork makes the dram work
[1:46:01] <+dumemoto> I-ITS NOT STUPID
[1:46:04] <@dcn2049> oh a big one
[1:46:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> they have... 1 wing
[1:46:15] <examplez0> "friends"
[1:46:19] <+silvery_cricket> OH GOD THEY DO HAVE ONE WING
[1:46:21] <arkv01> s-shutup plague, anime's cool when tifa's bouncing around!
[1:46:36] <Sokumotanaka> Other monsters: I didn't vote for him
[1:46:39] <$vampireinarm> the ghosts only show up when the writer's couldnt figure out how to steer the story
[1:46:40] <MrHappyFunshine> oh fuck, they do, fuck
[1:46:48] <$vampireinarm> switch
[1:46:50] <CaptHat211> The one wing look was always stupid
[1:46:54] <+samirrsp> change to barret
[1:46:59] <saddlezilla1> Admittedly I don't have a prob w/ the flips & shit so far. Mainly cuz OG Tifa eventually ends up suplexing Kaiju
[1:47:03] <kentrix11> I mean og had the Tifa suplex stuff for her limits, like suplexing ruby weapon was always fun to see.
[1:47:16] <kentrix11> Then again that's gameplay.
[1:47:25] <MiskatonicAlum> you were supposed to close the vent, and then the big one threw a smaller one, destroying the vent covering
[1:47:30] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:47:32] <+silvery_cricket> the vent plague
[1:47:39] <$vampireinarm> you gotta switch to barret
[1:47:40] <mark1247> SWITCH
[1:47:58] <kentrix11> I love how he just flexes.
[1:48:12] <MrHappyFunshine> It calls them failed yet they look like they have manufacture in a specific manner rather than just being mutants
[1:48:18] <xrolenks> you need a cutscene to get her down dude, sorry
[1:48:18] <saddlezilla1> @kentrix11 I think it's okay & still works in a setting like this. I just don't think they should be at AC levels of anime crazy till FAR later
[1:48:18] <examplez0> Shoot the core
[1:48:31] <+texflexrex> they all failed in the same way
[1:48:41] <xrolenks> you can punch there sometimes
[1:48:42] <+justianxix> They look like a mix between humans and the dogs with their weird tails
[1:48:53] <@dcn2049> good job tifa
[1:48:57] <kentrix11> @saddlezilla1 Yeah fair enough, besides fighting giant Kaiju is pretty darn anime in anyway.
[1:49:01] <arkv01> whoa, that's brutal dude
[1:49:16] <+silvery_cricket> This sucks
[1:49:17] <@dcn2049> smells like padding
[1:49:21] <london_flexing> That was really stupid
[1:49:33] <kentrix11> I don't remember having nearlt this much problem.
[1:49:37] <+silvery_cricket> Nomura clearly drew these and now we gotta fight them for 30 minutes
[1:49:41] <saddlezilla1> yup. I'm fine w/ end game Cloud choppng buildings in half, just not early game Cloud.
[1:49:53] <xrolenks> the boi need some heals
[1:50:02] <arkv01> did cloud bisect a building in AC? I can't remember
[1:50:04] <Explodincatz> is this a muso?
[1:50:19] <+silvery_cricket> Cloud did slice a building in Advent
[1:50:23] <Zinax7> look at this neo heartless boss
[1:50:24] <+silvery_cricket> and flew in Dirger
[1:50:26] <SuperVaderMan> At least this enemy isn't bouncing around all over the arena
[1:50:26] <xrolenks> poison
[1:50:28] <+silvery_cricket> Dirge
[1:50:28] <MrHappyFunshine> Spehiroth has chopped buildings numerous times
[1:50:36] <arkv01> I mean yeah seph sure
[1:50:38] <MrHappyFunshine> Cloud not so sure
[1:50:53] <Sokumotanaka> "
[1:50:58] <$Turtlemancer9> Cheer100
[1:50:59] <Flamethrowerman09> Are these Hojo's experiments that he flushed down the toilet?
[1:51:11] <MrHappyFunshine> daw
[1:51:13] <@dcn2049> why do all the summons scream like that
[1:51:17] <rubbishbinge> Magnify blizzard would be good right about now
[1:51:24] <ScreamLord> I don't like the new Moogle design
[1:51:26] <arkv01> except shiva, shiva says "mommys here"
[1:51:29] <saddlezilla1> @arkv01 cloud chopped up the building chunks Seph threw, which still weighed like several tons
[1:51:31] <Sokumotanaka> "The big one is the only one that matters" Got if I had a dollar for every time I heard that when being picked for sports in school
[1:51:33] <sniffy77> Are these Hojo's turds?
[1:51:41] <MrHappyFunshine> It really should just swap the music to chocobo music when it comes in
[1:51:42] <+justianxix> pretty sure
[1:52:00] <xrolenks> heal time
[1:52:17] <+justianxix> let the Chocobo get the final hit
[1:52:24] <MrHappyFunshine> Shoot him in the junk
[1:52:30] <arkv01> what is the point of the moogle even
[1:52:36] <arkv01> fucking freeloader
[1:52:46] <Sokumotanaka> @arkv01 He heals
[1:52:51] <rubbishbinge> Moogle casts wind magic
[1:52:51] <Sokumotanaka> I knew it!
[1:53:03] <ScreamLord> MEGABUSTER
[1:53:09] <notanegg8> at least cloud has the courtesy not to killsteal
[1:53:13] <Frankomancer> it even dissolved away like a heartless
[1:53:13] <Sokumotanaka> Cloud came in to take credit
[1:53:18] <+ThePhasingOctopus> guyver
[1:53:21] <xrolenks> the boxes!!!
[1:53:25] <alextrebeken> this the one with the train suplex?
[1:53:30] <arkv01> new trend of monsters just melting into mako pyreflies
[1:53:34] <kentrix11> Every enemy dissolves like a heartless in this game when tehy die.
[1:53:34] <notanegg8> that's it! he shoots bread crumbs
[1:53:43] <Kampler21> bullet crumbs
[1:53:45] <kentrix11> Main reason there's no blood in this game.
[1:53:52] <+HawkGoggles2> All of these boxes have holes in them. Barret must be close.
[1:53:54] <MiskatonicAlum> train suplex is 6, this is the kaiju suplex one
[1:54:04] <xrolenks> he followed the boxes to get here
[1:54:12] <alextrebeken> gotcah
[1:54:14] <SuperVaderMan> I'm glad it just lets you shoot your party members
[1:54:16] <arkv01> oh shit, we're getting LORE
[1:54:26] <Sokumotanaka> Huh so that's where my missing sister went
[1:54:27] <%caramello_man> what happened to wedge?
[1:54:31] <+silvery_cricket> CLOUD YOU HAVE NO MEMORIES
[1:54:32] <kentrix11> Something I like in the remake is how more organic the flashbacks Cloud has.
[1:54:49] <arkv01> ok so these are mako mutants
[1:54:50] <examplez0> Isn't this Deepground
[1:54:54] <examplez0> From Dirge of Cerberus
[1:55:03] <+justianxix> GET OUT
[1:55:06] <Johnmaddened> ree! you can't see this!
[1:55:08] <+silvery_cricket> So did they just leave Wedge
[1:55:10] <@dcn2049> time farts
[1:55:14] <kentrix11> The ghosts are fans that want a normal remake.
[1:55:15] <saddlezilla1> anyone surprised that pat's so far on board w/ Remake? Thought he & plague would be on the same page.
[1:55:16] <Kampler21> HE KNOWS TOO MUCH
[1:55:20] <OToole42> thats rad
[1:55:21] <ScreamLord> YES
[1:55:22] <%Samex_Comex> Spooky
[1:55:25] <+silvery_cricket> Oh there he is
[1:55:28] <MrHappyFunshine> They were stopping him from entering dirge of Cerberus
[1:55:29] <+silvery_cricket> out of frame and fa
[1:55:29] <saddlezilla1> nice
[1:55:35] <Frankomancer> @saddlezilla1 nostalgia and hype are powerful drugs
[1:55:48] <OToole42> wedge probably has pretty numb legs, from the diabeetus
[1:55:51] <examplez0> Did anybody actually like Dirge of Cerberus
[1:55:52] <+silvery_cricket> How the fuck did Wedge even survive
[1:55:53] <+XxBTExX> the time ghosts fucked up. Wedge survived
[1:56:00] <xrolenks> where the fuck did the ghosts send you that made you randomly find wedge
[1:56:02] <arkv01> where's the other two kitty
[1:56:06] <examplez0> It was poorly received even in Japan
[1:56:08] <Sol_Install> @saddlezilla1 pat hasn't reached this far
[1:56:09] <arkv01> oh fuk is this symbolism
[1:56:09] <sniffy77> Lets be real. They're wondering why the fuck it had to be wedge that survived
[1:56:17] <arkv01> the other two kitties = biggs and jessie bein ded
[1:56:20] <Kampler21> Cloud is so awkward lol
[1:56:25] <+silvery_cricket> Well Wedge wasn't at the top of the tower
[1:56:27] <Sokumotanaka> you mean barret you said cloud twice
[1:56:27] <kentrix11> Aerith gets better when you face bosses and change around.
[1:56:31] <notanegg8> that segment was delightful, hope it's not completely downhill from here
[1:56:40] <+justianxix> Pretty sure she gets pretty OP if you do set up
[1:56:40] <sniffy77> Aww Tifa has a kitty
[1:56:44] <saddlezilla1> @Sol_Install he & Woolie talked about it on the podcast today. He's already completely called it & is mostly onboard.
[1:56:49] <arkv01> the kitty tech in this game is great
[1:56:54] <+RealThiele> chonk kitty
[1:56:55] <ScreamLord> Hopefully Squinex listens to feed back and addresses these in Part 2
[1:57:10] <%Samex_Comex> Aw man not Jessue
[1:57:15] <%Samex_Comex> Jessie
[1:57:16] <Sokumotanaka> Oh god there might be a segment for every character...guys you know what that means? Playable solo cait sith NotLikeThis
[1:57:18] <+XxBTExX> Jessies is beyond dead
[1:57:19] <arkv01> biggs managed to find a few pots that slipped out from clouds pockets
[1:57:19] <+HawkGoggles2> Don't worry, Wedge counts for 3 people all by himself.
[1:57:19] <+silvery_cricket> Wait Wedge has grenades, why has he never used them?
[1:57:23] <Sol_Install> @saddlezilla1 I'll wait still, he can say one thing then reach the part and go like... "nah this is dumb"
[1:57:23] <MiskatonicAlum> RIP best girl
[1:57:24] <kentrix11> I hope Jessie is dead, I like her a lot in this so that's why.
[1:57:29] <Kampler21> Nomura btfo coomers
[1:57:30] <+justianxix> ohh that was a good one
[1:57:32] <+shootbang_exe> how are the ghosts not murdering the shit out of wedge rn
[1:57:33] <london_flexing> LUL
[1:57:36] <+XxBTExX> No amount of Phoenix Downs cant ress Jessie out of the rubble
[1:57:42] <saddlezilla1> LUL
[1:57:43] <BTRNDL> he fell into a hospital bed
[1:57:43] <Betofall> shows up in an organization hoodie
[1:57:43] <notanegg8> "you thought i'd let you do this alone?"
[1:57:49] <MiskatonicAlum> @silvery_cricket sqex doesnt understand how a grenade launcher works
[1:57:55] <examplez0> The debris bounced off his fat ass
[1:57:55] <arkv01> ha, weight, fat, thanks barret
[1:58:02] <+silvery_cricket> HES FAT
[1:58:02] <$Rivalshotzgp> The rebel time ghost clan
[1:58:07] <kentrix11> Nomura does explains this kinds of things but does so in an interview or some other thing if they are not bital tot he plot, which is really annoying.
[1:58:10] <+RealThiele> more terrorism will cure my blues
[1:58:13] <examplez0> Hey guys did you know Wedge is fat
[1:58:16] <+XxBTExX> Was that Barret's VA quoting Cowboy Bebop?
[1:58:18] <%CyberDingus> She can't die! Her THIRST must be SATED first!
[1:58:26] <Sokumotanaka> Cowboy bebop at this day and age?
[1:58:35] <arkv01> jesssie MUST die, you can't have 4 thots in episode 2
[1:58:37] <examplez0> Thought I'd mention how fat he is and it's so hilarious that he's always hungry
[1:58:51] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus Well she might as well stay dead cause it aint happening
[1:58:52] <BillieNoMates> That means Chadley is going to be a party member in Northern Crater
[1:58:53] <BillieNoMates> WEDGE
[1:58:57] <CaptHat211> 3 packs a day face
[1:58:58] <BillieNoMates> Fatman lives!
[1:59:01] <MiskatonicAlum> 5 thots, Barret dateable at Gold Saucer
[1:59:04] <arkv01> chadley is absolutely that secret boss fight
[1:59:06] <arkv01> 6 wings and shit
[1:59:07] <+XxBTExX> Time to ship Aeris's mom and Wedge. NTR doujin when?
[1:59:10] <+silvery_cricket> Is Wedge going to be the key to all of this, do we have to murder Wedge to fix the timelines.
[1:59:12] <OToole42> I kinda hope Jessie gets turned into a Shinra Bio-weapon and unleashed on the party like a horny Tyrant
[1:59:16] <ahaegotrigger> itd be nice if Wedge has a bit more character than just being fat
[1:59:28] <+justianxix> Cloud actually using reason
[1:59:30] <Betofall> are the time ghosts going to smother wedge?
[1:59:32] <kentrix11> Something I appreciated in KH3 is that they kinda made some people remain dead or die, so I'm hopefull Nomura won't just make everyone live in the remakes either.
[1:59:49] <saddlezilla1> so in other news. ppl have already gotten their hands on some of the in game models... specifically Jessie
[1:59:50] <sniffy77> Wait why are they listening to her
[1:59:56] <+XxBTExX> Knock some fucking buckets while you go up the stairs. Wake everyone up
[1:59:57] <@dcn2049> Taking forever to do things totally helped solve the pillar problem
[2:00:05] <%caramello_man> haha the time ghosts are you
[2:00:06] <%CyberDingus> @Sokumotanaka you underestimating her horniness
[2:00:08] <Sokumotanaka> Why are they waiting on her say so?
[2:00:14] <rubbishbinge> Time Ghosts just look at Wedge and sigh
[2:00:17] <+XxBTExX> Careful Plague, the buckets
[2:00:27] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus She's dead, let it go you're in denial
[2:00:28] <examplez0> Aerith's mother died trying to escape from Shinra and they think they'll just let Aerith go with no dramas
[2:00:30] <+silvery_cricket> Wedge was a undercover time ghosts all along
[2:00:33] <notanegg8> @CyberDingus what, for life?
[2:00:33] <+silvery_cricket> FUCKING FAT NARC
[2:00:34] <arkv01> time ghosts be like 'haha fat funny, let this one live'
[2:00:41] <+RealThiele> crimes are tiring
[2:00:57] <+XxBTExX> cant go inside Aeris's room to sniff her panties
[2:01:02] <sniffy77> If time ghost really are making everything happen they way they did, then I hopemwe see a time ghost with a revolving breaking in to kill wedge
[2:01:09] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Why do they care if Elmyra lets them go save Aerith or not? Why do they need her permission?
[2:01:12] <+kenuran> shooting dogs and carrying a fat man around really tired our Barret out
[2:01:12] <saddlezilla1> "whatever. fuck it at this point... as long as Seph dies i don't give a shit anymore." - Time Ghosts probably
[2:01:15] <arkv01> can't have you finding all the fetish outfits in aeris' room ScaredyCat
[2:01:20] <sniffy77> No timey whooshes, just have them with guns
[2:01:38] <notanegg8> this is your most ambitious album to date
[2:01:38] <arkv01> need tifa for the emotional support
[2:01:43] <+silvery_cricket> Bring Wedge he is apparently immortal
[2:01:49] <+XxBTExX> just do her under the lamp post, no one will know
[2:01:53] <EliahNebb> Don't cry for me, The Cheat. I can make it on my own!
[2:02:04] <kentrix11> I'm fairly sure Wedge just fucking dies later on.
[2:02:05] <ScreamLord> "Whys is THIS place in the slums?"
[2:02:08] <saddlezilla1> I know we're being kinda down on it... but I admittedly love this addition here.
[2:02:09] <+RealThiele> tits mcgee
[2:02:13] <Explodincatz> most of them are
[2:02:14] <+HawkGoggles2> Tifa is "childhood friend"
[2:02:18] <arkv01> tifa watched her dad get impaled, it was rough
[2:02:22] <MiskatonicAlum> childhood friend
[2:02:24] <fluffy_sauce> savage!
[2:02:27] <+XxBTExX> The brain juice went to her chest beefers
[2:02:30] <arkv01> the childhood hoe MUST win
[2:02:30] <MiskatonicAlum> is a japanese trope personality
[2:02:31] <kentrix11> Aerith had the most personality.
[2:02:36] <CaptHat211> *GASP* How DARE you speak the truth, Eli!
[2:02:40] <Futurecity10> I can never spell it, but shes the osajamini
[2:02:52] <arran_throttle> CLOOOUD, would you do me a solid?
[2:03:03] <+XxBTExX> Fuck em both, Yuffie 4 lyfe
[2:03:15] <Futurecity10> osananajimi
[2:03:16] <saddlezilla1> Disagree. Tifa's a great character, but too much of her in OG has to revolve around Cloud.
[2:03:17] <%JailShmixRemix> Tifa's hot
[2:03:18] <Kampler21> What about Yuffie
[2:03:26] <kentrix11> Eh I like how they subert their respective tropes, but Tifa is mostly nice to subert the tomboy trope.
[2:03:28] <MiskatonicAlum> actually feels like Jessie got the most development in remake
[2:03:32] <+justianxix> Sephroth just shows up
[2:03:35] <+kenuran> The Breasts are talking
[2:03:50] <kentrix11> Oh yeah she did live there for 5 years.
[2:03:52] <+0ni0n_L0rd> She has heartbreak
[2:03:59] <Sokumotanaka> yup that's why I never get why people say tifa is so developed in the old game when her personality was so singular on cloud
[2:04:02] <BillieNoMates> She has a smoking hot bod. That's all women need to succeed
[2:04:03] <arkv01> SHES WINNING
[2:04:05] <+RealThiele> i know why humans cry now
[2:04:09] <+XxBTExX> Did Tifa confront Cloud already about him not being in Nibelheim?
[2:04:11] <examplez0> Too much of her in the remake also revolves around Cloud
[2:04:12] <Mexrage> she lost her entire lifehood...twice in the past 5 years
[2:04:17] <+silvery_cricket> YEAH TIFA GRAB THAT TIT SECOND BASE
[2:04:19] <CaptHat211> I still prefer her over Aerith b/c Aerith was so wispy and dull
[2:04:20] <Frankomancer> Cloud is probably thinking of Aeris right now
[2:04:21] <BillieNoMates> "goddammit I wish Zack was around. This is his problem"
[2:04:22] <arkv01> USE THOSE HANDS CLODD
[2:04:23] <Betofall> this is the first time he has seen tears
[2:04:23] <+0ni0n_L0rd> There we goo
[2:04:26] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Good biy
[2:04:26] <%Samex_Comex> Barret help!
[2:04:27] <@dcn2049> there we go
[2:04:28] <Frankomancer> "I wonder what Aeris is doing"
[2:04:28] <+HawkGoggles2> Do hug, do comfort?
[2:04:30] <@dcn2049> awkward mess
[2:04:36] <+kenuran> lol Clod Strife
[2:04:37] <Pencildragon> Cloud's robot emotions can't comprehend
[2:04:40] <Josshoo> A hug equals a reverse Arcana, P3 taught me that
[2:04:42] <+silvery_cricket> Be hilarious if he just stood there and didn't move
[2:04:43] <MiskatonicAlum> clone-man tries to mimic human emotion
[2:04:43] <+Punishedkaiger> "Barret, help, human contact is weird"
[2:04:45] <arkv01> oh god the hard edge LUL
[2:04:47] <Sokumotanaka> Grab the titty tifa
[2:04:54] <Betofall> the date with tifa is canon the
[2:04:56] <ckkc1> LUL
[2:04:56] <BillieNoMates> Cloud just mutates into a Jenova monster right now
[2:05:00] <Johnmaddened> LUL
[2:05:01] <+silvery_cricket> SEPHIROTH IN 3
[2:05:03] <BillieNoMates> The Time ghosts completely confused
[2:05:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Wow
[2:05:07] <+XxBTExX> Couldve been worse. Atleast they didnt swim in the water and kissed while some japanese song played in the background
[2:05:08] <+silvery_cricket> 2
[2:05:10] <+zackalan> @plagueofgripes have you got to the section where Tifa does pull-ups?
[2:05:11] <+silvery_cricket> 1
[2:05:11] <+RealThiele> barrett date is master canon
[2:05:13] <Sokumotanaka> HUG YOU R MOM CLOUD. PLOT TWIST!
[2:05:13] <saddlezilla1> ok so is the close up on the water supposed to refrence the lifestream scene?
[2:05:13] <+silvery_cricket> stab
[2:05:17] <arkv01> and then they FUCKED
[2:05:22] <+justianxix> Pretty sure you can get different scenes
[2:05:30] <Mexrage> barret looks so much better without the sunglasses
[2:05:40] <MrHappyFunshine> Holla at yo boi Elmyra
[2:05:40] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Yeah I met Aerith outside,not Tifa

[2:06:31] <+silvery_cricket> Acknowledge Wedge you bastards
[2:06:33] <Sokumotanaka> Your daughter could be KNOTTED right now lady why did we wait this long!?
[2:06:38] <saddlezilla1> It'd be hilarious if Elmyra had the hots for Barret
[2:06:39] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Big daddy energy
[2:06:47] <+kenuran> Elmyra almost has the same color scheme as the Elmyra from Tiny Toons and i cant shake that
[2:06:48] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus yeah so am I also that was a late reply XD
[2:06:48] <CaptHat211> D'aaawwwww
[2:06:58] <arkv01> this is a good scene
[2:07:11] <OToole42> @Sokumotanaka theres a mental image I never had before, poor Aerith
[2:07:12] <arkv01> I love video game dads
[2:07:13] <+XxBTExX> "Fuck Da Police" - Barret 2020
[2:07:25] <@dcn2049> pretty much
[2:07:29] <BillieNoMates> Marlene is smart enough to know she's adopted
[2:07:36] <Betofall> do you think they'll bring back the part where cait sith threatens them with marlene?
[2:07:37] <Josshoo> They might be happy their dad is a superhero
[2:07:41] <Sokumotanaka> @OToole42 they gae you that mental image in the first one
[2:07:47] <arkv01> she was thinking it :)
[2:08:01] <+XxBTExX> Can you hear the EMOTIONS
[2:08:04] <BillieNoMates> That was an genetic trait of the Ancient
[2:08:06] <MrHappyFunshine> Barret is such a good boy
[2:08:07] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes "Daddy has to stick it the man, sweety. Be good while he's blowing up the power plants."
[2:08:10] <BillieNoMates> Probably not
[2:08:11] <OToole42> @Sokumotanaka my mind never went there sadly
[2:08:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Probably not
[2:08:12] <+XxBTExX> they sound like a sad piano
[2:08:13] <MiskatonicAlum> @arkv01 we wre ALL thinking it
[2:08:14] <fluffy_sauce> they did
[2:08:15] <Sokumotanaka> She's so cute!
[2:08:17] <LunarRemix> It sounds like a real kid
[2:08:19] <CaptHat211> Can't play patty-cake with her
[2:08:21] <Betofall> just like kh1
[2:08:28] <+silvery_cricket> WHAT ABOUT WEDGE
[2:08:29] <kentrix11> Tha tor they already recorded the lines in advance.
[2:08:30] <+RealThiele> kids are expendable
[2:08:36] <Josshoo> A Persona is the mask we wear to face the world
[2:08:39] <+XxBTExX> LEEROY JENKINS

[2:09:00] <BillieNoMates> "lets build a plane out of the rockets"
[2:09:05] <saddlezilla1> gosh random aside - but is anyone else getting annoyed w/ ppl mood policing people over Remake?
[2:09:08] <BillieNoMates> That would be too interesting
[2:09:29] <+RealThiele> meowth, thats right
[2:09:32] <ahaegotrigger> thats right slam her pregnant till she cries
[2:09:33] <Mexrage> i don't think marlene appeared on the original after this, except for the ending @PlagueOfGripes they could just make her record that line there
[2:09:34] <+XxBTExX> incomming rule 34 Wedge and Elmyra
[2:09:40] <BillieNoMates> Marlene is still cute
[2:09:40] <MrHappyFunshine> mood policing?
[2:09:45] <+silvery_cricket> Plot twist Wedge was Sephiroth the whole time
[2:09:46] <Betofall> wow even the new plot forgot wedge lived
[2:09:58] <+texflexrex> she did get a bit brainwashed by barret
[2:10:00] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Plague you just hate kids.
[2:10:01] <BillieNoMates> Well Marlene has probably seen some shit given that you have giant ass rats that eat people
[2:10:04] <+justianxix> I prefer then bunch of the children in zillions of Dad simulators
[2:10:11] <+justianxix> *her
[2:10:12] <Sokumotanaka> I thought that was the cat sitting at the table LUL
[2:10:12] <+0ni0n_L0rd> *wink*
[2:10:15] <+XxBTExX> Barret shouldnt rub off too much on her
[2:10:16] <arkv01> LUL
[2:10:17] <CaptHat211> He's dead, Cloud
[2:10:21] <+silvery_cricket> He isnt moving
[2:10:25] <kentrix11> is being crazy a genetic thing?
[2:10:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> DEAD
[2:10:27] <BillieNoMates> Wedge is consuming the bed with his back
[2:10:30] <+RealThiele> wedge.jpg
[2:10:32] <Sol_Install> damn it
[2:10:33] <Betofall> he just has an insatiable urge to jump off cliffs
[2:10:35] <BillieNoMates> His fat is basically The Thing
[2:10:39] <Josshoo> Use a Pheonix down you sociopath!

[2:10:48] <Sol_Install> YEP
[2:10:48] <+LordSDB> NOOOO NotLikeThis
[2:10:49] <SuperVaderMan> Wedge eats food, do you get it 4Head
[2:10:50] <+silvery_cricket> HES FAT!
[2:10:51] <ahaegotrigger> YOU WERE RIGHT
[2:10:53] <kentrix11> It's relentless.
[2:10:54] <seth45er> YOU GET IT!
[2:10:55] <saddlezilla1> @MrHappyFunshine "U don't like thing? WHAT'S WRONG w/ you that's not allowed!" or "U like thing? WHAT'S WRONG WI-" basically that mindset
[2:10:56] <BillieNoMates> I don't get why they couldn't have just made Wedge the Chadley
[2:10:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> He's gonna stay in bed and lose all his weight
[2:10:57] <arkv01> ... supah nintendo
[2:10:58] <+XxBTExX> Biggie Smalls?
[2:11:01] <+silvery_cricket> Biggie Smalls?
[2:11:03] <BillieNoMates> It'd give a reason to keep him around
[2:11:03] <notanegg8> very good character. extremely fucking funny.
[2:11:07] <+RealThiele> Biggie Smalls
[2:11:11] <Sokumotanaka> Take his wallet!
[2:11:19] <ralanost> genuinely impressed that Wedge survived the plate falling on him
[2:11:21] <Josshoo> Wedge never thought to check
[2:11:22] <Betofall> wedge didn't check
[2:11:23] <rubbishbinge> he is too fat to be smart
[2:11:26] <BillieNoMates> He bleached and dyed EVERY cat
[2:11:29] <arkv01> borger
[2:11:31] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like cheeseburgers
[2:11:40] <arran_throttle> or he was a bit stupid about it and thought that one of them was male
[2:11:42] <+justianxix> I love how they build it up LUL
[2:11:44] <saddlezilla1> Well they didn't research how cocktails are made so I wouldn't be surprised.
[2:11:46] <kentrix11> The cat cheeseburger meme but with Wedge.
[2:11:51] <+XxBTExX> Maybe its a black and white cat and some of the kids in the slums dumped hydrogen peroxide and part of his black hair turned orange?
[2:12:01] <ahaegotrigger> hed eat his own head if it was a cheeseburger
[2:12:15] <+justianxix> Sad tits
[2:12:18] <BillieNoMates> PEDO materia
[2:12:19] <arkv01> sad, bit tiggy women

[2:12:32] <MrHappyFunshine> oh no
[2:12:34] <rubbishbinge> ehhhh, it's ok
[2:12:36] <+RealThiele> Ass SSS materia
[2:12:41] <+samirrsp> this transform to AP UP
[2:12:50] <ahaegotrigger> does it call the fbi?
[2:12:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> NotLikeThis
[2:13:07] <$jamarartdoodles> hide your lolis lol
[2:13:09] <notanegg8> turns into M.A.P UP
[2:13:14] <BillieNoMates> 5000 lolis later
[2:13:14] <saddlezilla1> Was Tifa having big boobs ever an actual big part of her character? Always thought her bigger trait was being nurturing.
[2:13:29] <examplez0> Honestly all the love interests in FF games are just "the love interest" with barely any personality beyond that
[2:13:31] <arkv01> I never noticed tifa's tits in the original tbh
[2:13:32] <+illoonar> what are lolis? :)
[2:13:36] <+Punishedkaiger> She nurtures with big milk
[2:13:36] <+RealThiele> nuture them tiddies
[2:13:36] <arkv01> but AC really phoned it in
[2:13:45] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:13:50] <+justianxix> Other then that she is so pretty she gets picked by Conreo, no
[2:13:54] <+XxBTExX> @examplez0 Fran was my love interest
[2:14:04] <ahaegotrigger> has to be
[2:14:06] <rubbishbinge> NOVEL CHARACTER
[2:14:09] <BillieNoMates> Thats going to be her
[2:14:13] <+justianxix> Its fucking Ann
[2:14:13] <arkv01> kyrie's gonna evolve into yuffie
[2:14:14] <+silvery_cricket> KYRIE
[2:14:16] <BillieNoMates> Remember this waifu
[2:14:18] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wow, sounds just like Yuffie's abridged voice
[2:14:20] <ahaegotrigger> oh shit shes cute
[2:14:21] <BillieNoMates> Its gonna be Yuffie
[2:14:24] <kentrix11> I thought herIt's Marie from Persona 4
[2:14:24] <TheWe4pon> I just relaized that you cannot change any of the characters names.
[2:14:25] <SuperVaderMan> Hey it's this girl, from on the train I think
[2:14:26] <Betofall> its a twewy character
[2:14:28] <+monkeyhous3> qt
[2:14:28] <Sol_Install> that texture pop up
[2:14:29] <examplez0> @XxBTExX Fran's VA is a 10/10
[2:14:30] <arkv01> I mean, ninjas disguise themselves and shit right?
[2:14:32] <+XxBTExX> No one would listen to that pretween twink
[2:14:32] <%Samex_Comex> Shorts over shorts?
[2:14:34] <sniffy77> Is she a kpop
[2:14:37] <BillieNoMates> Uppercut her
[2:14:40] <+0ni0n_L0rd> God she's hot
[2:14:40] <+silvery_cricket> LOOK AT THIS KINGDOM HEARTS CHARACTER
[2:14:40] <BillieNoMates> UPPERCUT HER
[2:14:42] <CaptHat211> "I'M SUPER SERIOUS ABOUT MY CAUSE, PEOPLE"
[2:14:43] <saddlezilla1> OH GOD. THIS CHARACTER IS TOTALLY GONNA HAVE A SCENE WITH YUFFIE LATER
[2:14:44] <+HawkGoggles2> Take the shot.
[2:14:44] <%JailShmixRemix> That hat looks very big
[2:14:45] <+justianxix> woo, that ass
[2:14:47] <+XxBTExX> Go Barret shoot the bitch
[2:14:48] <BillieNoMates> Yeah thats Yuffie
[2:14:48] <ahaegotrigger> looks like Tifas little sister
[2:14:49] <OToole42> barret just blows off her kneecap
[2:14:50] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Remember her from the train?
[2:14:51] <Sokumotanaka> That has to be her in disguise
[2:14:53] <GarbageQueenEllie> How tf did Marie get into Midgar?
[2:14:54] <saddlezilla1> THAT'S GONNA BE TERRIBLLLLLE
[2:15:01] <Sokumotanaka> nevermind
[2:15:01] <arkv01> this hoe MAD
[2:15:04] <examplez0> Oh hey it's not-Yuffie
[2:15:05] <%CyberDingus> what a fucking thot
[2:15:06] <ahaegotrigger> oh its Kyrie
[2:15:08] <+monkeyhous3> lmao PAY ME
[2:15:12] <+kenuran> Wu Tang
[2:15:13] <+XxBTExX> Wow, thottery
[2:15:18] <+monkeyhous3> 5 GIL
[2:15:18] <+silvery_cricket> Is that abridged Yuffie's voice actor
[2:15:18] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:15:22] <examplez0> Yeah it's the train girl
[2:15:27] <notanegg8> have we seen any avalanche sympathizers amongst the populace in this game even once?
[2:15:32] <+RealThiele> war crimes, no problem, but on his terms
[2:15:33] <CaptHat211> "Nomura's philosophy"
[2:15:44] <notanegg8> although i'd imagine after the plate drops they'd probably keep quiet
[2:15:44] <kentrix11> I do like how they are giving more ties to Wutai so going there later on isn't just some random thing you do cause Yuffie mentions it.
[2:15:48] <Sokumotanaka> FUCK HER BARRET
[2:15:50] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Too bad? Nah it's great!
[2:15:52] <$Rivalshotzgp> Not Leninists... SMH
[2:15:54] <CaptHat211> "There's no point in trying"
[2:15:57] <BillieNoMates> She's a hot waifu. She doesnt need a brain
[2:16:12] <arkv01> don't shoot the hoe, barret
[2:16:12] <Sokumotanaka> Barret can fucn train girl too
[2:16:16] <+XxBTExX> Crossing my fingers when they meet Yuffie Barret goes full Wakka and starts calling her a Wuttie.
[2:16:17] <BillieNoMates> "I need odd jobs"
[2:16:24] <BillieNoMates> cloud is such a money grubber
[2:16:24] <karl_rex> MORE FILLER
[2:16:28] <sniffy77> Nah do it time ghosts won't let anything bad happen you
[2:16:29] <@dcn2049> dammit
[2:16:30] <+justianxix> Is it just me, but the more I see this game the more I ship Barret and Tifa
[2:16:35] <CaptHat211> That NPC near the stage sorta looks like you, Eli
[2:16:35] <+monkeyhous3> oh boy filler
[2:16:37] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Stupid girls are great! They're just like smart girls, I can't understand them but hearing them talk makes my peepee hard.
[2:16:38] <arkv01> lets get our sidequest on
[2:16:49] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes The jobber Shinra dudes have cooler looking armor than Clouth does
[2:16:56] <saddlezilla1> I desperatly want Cloud to DESPISE Yuffie and Vincent initially
[2:17:07] <ScreamLord> *Cloud
[2:17:13] <BillieNoMates> Why does this kid have weapons?
[2:17:22] <SuperVaderMan> I'm glad this dork's moogle costume remained pristine
[2:17:26] <rubbishbinge> crab claws for barret!
[2:17:30] <+XxBTExX> Its the slums. all kids have weapons in the slums
[2:17:31] <%Samex_Comex> Not the creepy moogle kid
[2:17:33] <Explodincatz> the kid runs the white market
[2:17:34] <Sol_Install> lul
[2:17:39] <arkv01> cloud will assuredly give yuffie his scorn, but he's gonna brofist vinent and be like "YEHA BOY YOU GONNA FUCK THAT GENESIS RIGHT?"
[2:17:40] <saddlezilla1> I will say Cloud's early comment to Moggie bout making him smile was fantastic.
[2:17:41] <BillieNoMates> yeeeeeeeeees
[2:17:49] <BillieNoMates> The abortion claws
[2:18:07] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> you've got mythril claws
[2:18:27] <+RealThiele> loser, kupo
[2:18:29] <Frankomancer> why couldnt Moggie have been crushed by rubble
[2:18:32] <+claudesavegely> don't bully the kupo lad
[2:18:54] <arkv01> reeves, don't you have better things to do with your time?
[2:18:55] <MrHappyFunshine> Reeve loves murder
[2:18:55] <+eanscrale> Hey, he had to steal those rare antique weapons somehow
[2:18:56] <+justianxix> That shit was hilarious LUL
[2:19:09] <Betofall> may it works like g gundam
[2:19:11] <Sokumotanaka> XDDDD
[2:19:16] <notanegg8> no it dropped to its knees and punched the ground
[2:19:32] <%caramello_man> asiaboy
[2:19:37] <Sokumotanaka> Isn't cait suppose to have some sort of sentience? Do they ever explain that?
[2:19:45] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Nice
[2:19:46] <BillieNoMates> Can't wait for Chocobos to shit on you
[2:19:51] <BillieNoMates> Those are some bad names
[2:20:09] <saddlezilla1> @arkv01 I desperately want Cloud to hate how edgy & tryhard Vincent seems to be, only to hours later have the internal realization & fearfully try to get rid of his own edge persona LUL
[2:20:10] <arkv01> @Sokumotanaka actually yeah, I think cait sith was supposed to have some degree of AI cause it expressed feelings at the temple
[2:20:15] <kentrix11> Chocobos are really cute in this game.
[2:20:18] <ralanost> What trash, TRASH side quests. Such a waste of time that doesn't add to the game other than play time
[2:21:16] <kentrix11> @saddlezilla1 IIRC og FF7 has Cloud mention Vincent looks "cool".
[2:21:17] <+monkeyhous3> oh wow that lipsync lol
[2:21:21] <Explodincatz> hah
[2:21:26] <BillieNoMates> Thats not facial hair
[2:21:27] <saddlezilla1> Wallmarket took sidequest budget
[2:21:31] <notanegg8> if only this game wasn't so linear, sidequests might be satisfying to manage over the course of the game
[2:21:34] <Sokumotanaka> @arkv01 Man Anime is weird
[2:21:43] <examplez0> This is clearly far more important than trying to save Aerith
[2:21:44] <BillieNoMates> Wait. That's Plague with a hat on
[2:21:45] <ahaegotrigger> oh this is Yuffie then
[2:21:46] <+kenuran> the lipsync is pretty much nonexistant for these sidequest characters
[2:21:52] <CaptHat211> G'nite
[2:21:56] <saddlezilla1> @kentrix11 dammit. that means the dynamic will either be boring af or oddly cute at best.
[2:22:00] <ahaegotrigger> and the earlier girl was a deliberate jebait
[2:22:17] <BillieNoMates> "My life isn't important. I need to make my tumblr posts"
[2:22:20] <Sokumotanaka> Another hell house?
[2:22:29] <BillieNoMates> Hell house mk2
[2:22:31] <examplez0> Plague doesn't have that much hair
[2:22:34] <ahaegotrigger> I bet hed have a checkmark on twitter
[2:22:58] <kentrix11> @saddlezilla1 I assume it will be like Nanaki and Cloud in here since the 3 ar just a bunch of edge boys.

[2:22:59] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 23 minutes 10 seconds
[2:24:04] <saddlezilla1> @kentrix11 from what I've seen, Red & Cloud's dynamic in Remake is probably the least intersting, correct?
[2:24:11] <Cannonissomoney> John Oliver?
[2:24:11] <arkv01> naw red isn't edge so much as daddy issues
[2:24:14] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> johnoliver
[2:24:15] <stratfel112> I really appreciate the lip sync outside of cut scenes is okay and aren't just mouths flapping like in other games
[2:24:15] <BillieNoMates> John Oliver
[2:24:18] <BillieNoMates> The cuck of cucks
[2:24:19] <Melchior_the_Wise> John Stewart?
[2:24:34] <arkv01> johns a cuck?
[2:25:17] <kentrix11> @saddlezilla1 They are kinda just bros that try to act cool, in the og the charm of it came from Nanaki kinda looking up to Cloud a bit, so with Vincent I guess Cloud looks up to him a bit.
[2:25:29] <Sokumotanaka> wife!
[2:25:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No
[2:25:33] <Explodincatz> shut up
[2:25:34] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Leave her alone
[2:25:34] <+samirrsp> No
[2:25:34] <%CyberDingus> would be nice
[2:25:37] <arkv01> are we gonna bust her
[2:25:41] <Sokumotanaka> Leave her alone
[2:25:44] <saddlezilla1> meh
[2:25:47] <%CyberDingus> can't trust a hoe some innocent kids!
[2:26:21] <Kampler21> chocobo
[2:26:50] <arkv01> this is just the fetch the cats quest, except we're doing it for poultry
[2:27:04] <saddlezilla1> @kentrix11 would like to see more then. admittedly in OG the writing started to fall off for the party members post-midgar, until Cid at least.
[2:27:16] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:27:24] <%CyberDingus> GET SOME SHIRT
[2:27:29] <saddlezilla1> Yuri sure is Lowenthalling
[2:27:47] <cyberblueneon> this games tone is way more lighthearted than the original
[2:27:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Oh?
[2:27:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> She?
[2:28:01] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Very interesting.
[2:28:03] <%CyberDingus> He got thotthed
[2:28:08] <Frankomancer> this seems like a weird tone for midgar
[2:28:13] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Oh
[2:28:17] <BillieNoMates> its a programmer
[2:28:21] <LokimenD> KYRIE!
[2:28:23] <+LordSDB> The sidesquests really remind me of FF15
[2:28:23] <+kenuran> Kyrie Irving
[2:28:24] <BillieNoMates> Dont trust those stockings
[2:28:27] <Sokumotanaka> Yufflie?
[2:28:38] <Sokumotanaka> nevermind
[2:29:27] <arkv01> this is perfect
[2:29:43] <Sokumotanaka> I feel like she's either yuffie in disguise for some reason or she's yuffle's antagonist.
[2:30:03] <+XxBTExX> damn
[2:30:08] <%laserbeaming> Will you become a Time Ghost when you die Plague?
[2:30:17] <kentrix11> I think the sector 5 music was my favorite from the remake, it's really good, that acustic version of hollow.
[2:30:34] <SupportWriter> No, Kyrie is from a Turk side story that is set place before AC
[2:31:00] <arkv01> mr uematsu is half the reason the OG is memorable as it is
[2:31:12] <saddlezilla1> So Cloud canonically likes sweethearted caring women & hippie assertive weirdos. what kinda girls would he hate?
[2:31:17] <%laserbeaming> Tifa is just the right amount of Anime
[2:31:28] <Sokumotanaka> Idk if that's the same Kyrie
[2:31:53] <arkv01> its terrified!
[2:31:56] <+XxBTExX> chicken
[2:32:02] <saddlezilla1> oh that's actutally upsetting :(
[2:32:08] <$jamarartdoodles> lol
[2:32:11] <+XxBTExX> greens are reds
[2:32:38] <notanegg8> one beet and the trauma from the sound and sensation of the collapsing plate magically disappears!
[2:32:45] <%laserbeaming> It was named by someone who was Green-Red Colorblind
[2:33:10] <arkv01> I mean this is how a pedometer should work
[2:33:19] <Sokumotanaka> Chocobo are like pokemon they're cute but the most powerful creatures ever, why is a chocobo afraid of anything?
[2:33:21] <+XxBTExX> maybe steps in fights
[2:33:38] <notanegg8> grind it off screen!
[2:33:46] <TheWe4pon> just run into a wall and attach a rubberband
[2:33:47] <%laserbeaming> Pedometers measure steps, contrary to popular belief
[2:33:54] <rubbishbinge> Counts distance travelled, so running into a wall wont work sadly
[2:34:45] <arkv01> yeah I checked in subsequent runs
[2:34:47] <kentrix11> It was a box with a machine gun attached that would shut you, when you return is turned off and you can take it.
[2:34:49] <+XxBTExX> i didnt
[2:34:54] <arkv01> then on even more subsequent runs I just used gameshark to res her
[2:35:03] <Johnmaddened> that was a thing? neat
[2:35:13] <+XxBTExX> Plague sexually harassed the ghost
[2:35:33] <%laserbeaming> Kill her, then seduce her ghost
[2:35:33] <notanegg8> that's strong
[2:35:36] <%laserbeaming> that's the way

[2:36:24] <+XxBTExX> touch the girl
[2:36:37] <arkv01> max out the pedometer materia
[2:36:46] <arkv01> then you hear the sirens
[2:37:10] <examplez0> That's a herb for the doctor
[2:37:20] <examplez0> Another side quest
[2:37:45] <%JailShmixRemix> Marie
[2:37:45] <ckkc1> what
[2:37:55] <SuperVaderMan> keer-yay?
[2:37:55] <ckkc1> is that how you pronounce kyrie
[2:37:58] <arkv01> she's got the mug materia huh
[2:38:02] <Frankomancer> ugh more side characters
[2:38:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> oh snap, this is a TURK
[2:38:07] <ckkc1> I thought it was
[2:38:14] <ckkc1> 'kai-ree'
[2:38:15] <%laserbeaming> I like her more than Nero's Kyrie
[2:38:15] <cyberblueneon> now i remember that thing that happened 10 minutes ago
[2:38:23] <NineBall3D> @PlagueOfGripes whos ur best FF girl of all time, if u cant choose, gimme a top 3?
[2:38:36] <examplez0> She might as well be Yuffie in disguise
[2:38:38] <Flamethrowerman09> Except Yuffie was optional.
[2:38:41] <+HawkGoggles2> Instead of materia it's money.
[2:38:41] <GiygasDrillBreak> wait nvm i confused her for someone else
[2:38:42] <arkv01> nero's kyrie is essentially a pillow
[2:38:45] <SupportWriter> @PlagueOfGripes She is from a side story
[2:38:50] <seth45er> i don't why they couldn't add yuffie early
[2:39:02] <arkv01> bitch pls return the money
[2:39:05] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Dude, I'm a sucker for girl's in cute hats.
[2:39:05] <examplez0> Because they can't do anything with her yet
[2:39:09] <MrHappyFunshine> Yep
[2:39:09] <+XxBTExX> shes probably in some doujin
[2:39:09] <rubbishbinge> She's from a novel
[2:39:11] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I wonder what they're gonna do with Vincent and Yuffie? The OG had some narrative weirdness with them because they were optional before.
[2:39:15] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I'm loving this
[2:39:20] <mrgaster8> eeew
[2:39:22] <Johnmaddened> oh I hate this
[2:39:33] <GeltonZ> I am totally down with this girl who is totally not Yuffie in a wig.
[2:39:53] <arkv01> something about her makes me want to simp
[2:39:53] <+monkeyhous3> the mouth movements are so weird looking
[2:39:54] <%JailShmixRemix> They do
[2:39:56] <Explodincatz> she needs to get knotted
[2:39:57] <BillieNoMates> I still think this is Yuffie
[2:39:59] <mrgaster8> yup
[2:39:59] <arkv01> yeah absolutely
[2:40:00] <+XxBTExX> Yeah they do
[2:40:02] <Futurecity10> yeah, tomboy
[2:40:02] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ Hey GEL.
[2:40:13] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay Hello!
[2:40:14] <theloganbrand> This character is from a book
[2:40:14] <ahaegotrigger> this has to be Yuffie she has the voice
[2:40:17] <%JailShmixRemix> LOL
[2:40:19] <%laserbeaming> to me, all japanese terms are Netotare
[2:40:20] <NineBall3D> whos ur best FF girl of all time, if u cant choose, gimme a top 3? @PlagueOfGripes
[2:40:22] <mrgaster8> yeah
[2:40:22] <+jiggy_snipe> LUL
[2:40:24] <examplez0> They're just regular girls with short hair and tanlines
[2:40:24] <+XxBTExX> THey are normal women with short hair who like to get NTRd
[2:40:24] <Frankomancer> @Explodincatz a bold statement but not a wrong one
[2:40:26] <%CyberDingus> slightly less super femenin women
[2:40:27] <ahaegotrigger> TRUE
[2:40:30] <examplez0> And a passion for sports
[2:40:32] <+HawkGoggles2> Short hair, tanned skill, It's my favorite.
[2:40:34] <Croetec> or not enough monkaHmm
[2:40:37] <GeltonZ> Probably uses Boku.
[2:40:39] <+HawkGoggles2> Skin*
[2:40:41] <%JailShmixRemix> It probably has to do with what japan wants in women
[2:40:49] <MrHappyFunshine> It isn't Yuffie, i wish it was but it isn't
[2:40:50] <+XxBTExX> Its not like I want you inside me or something ba-baka
[2:40:55] <examplez0> Y'Shtola
[2:40:58] <+jiggy_snipe> Lulu was a tomboy?
[2:40:59] <Futurecity10> Yshtola
[2:41:00] <%CyberDingus> Mommy? :y
[2:41:01] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Wow
[2:41:04] <%CyberDingus> Wait what?
[2:41:07] <arkv01> mommy yssh
[2:41:08] <%laserbeaming> Yifftola
[2:41:13] <+XxBTExX> Yiffing
[2:41:24] <kentrix11> That's because japan has super sexism and a woman being slightly outside of the hyper girly range is a "tomboy" so a lot of characters that are girly with a tomboy facade exist.
[2:41:24] <OToole42> Celes
[2:41:28] <rubbishbinge> Aranea tho
[2:41:28] <+XxBTExX> Lulu's not much of a tomboy
[2:41:31] <Brainworm205> Yshtola? She can step on me any day
[2:41:38] <+0ni0n_L0rd> You keep saying that
[2:41:38] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> you have a mitryl claw
[2:42:02] <arkv01> freya poggies
[2:42:04] <SuperVaderMan> the good rat girl LUL
[2:42:05] <%laserbeaming> Freya is top tier
[2:42:07] <ScreamLord> Lightening? Pff nah
[2:42:07] <+XxBTExX> Fran top girl
[2:42:08] <examplez0> Rinoa is the ultimate MPDG
[2:42:08] <ahaegotrigger> not Fran
[2:42:10] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I worry about you sometimes buddy
[2:42:10] <+jiggy_snipe> Freya is cool
[2:42:10] <%CyberDingus> Lulu is a mommy woman though?
[2:42:11] <OToole42> Freya is great, Scandanavian bunny
[2:42:13] <Brainworm205> Chie is better punchgirl than Tifa tho
[2:42:17] <Vaiire> You forget about Fran? You almost had a monstergirl trio.
[2:42:25] <Johnmaddened> Freya is good
[2:42:26] <GeltonZ> @OToole42 That's Fran. Freya is the rat dragoon.
[2:42:27] <%laserbeaming> Fran is OK
[2:42:33] <+XxBTExX> Plague forgets about best girl Fran
[2:42:37] <Sokumotanaka> Freya IS cool though
[2:42:41] <Brainworm205> Fran rulz
[2:42:42] <examplez0> Fran's VA is super hot
[2:42:47] <BillieNoMates> 300g is about 3 fights
[2:42:54] <BillieNoMates> So yeah, It's not cheap
[2:42:55] <OToole42> @GeltonZ thanks, all these animal women blend together
[2:42:56] <examplez0> If you've ever seen pictures of her
[2:43:00] <examplez0> Her name is Nicole Fantl
[2:43:01] <%laserbeaming> Fran is Best Chewbacca
[2:43:04] <+LordSDB> Yeah but you got a lot of potions worth selling and other junk
[2:43:50] <+XxBTExX> put on the Pedo
[2:44:01] <arkv01> fran is just kinda "im a bunny"
[2:44:06] <ScreamLord> And Playboy Bunnie design
[2:44:11] <+LordSDB> Hoarding all the potions Plague LUL
[2:44:36] <fluffy_sauce> Fran's appeal was her playboy bunny ears
[2:44:38] <CaptainFrankincense> potions are for boss fights
[2:44:40] <%laserbeaming> Vieras in general lack in personality. Too stoic
[2:44:41] <+LordSDB> Fran whole race is amazon bunnies
[2:44:43] <examplez0> Lulu (from FF10) is a pretty good choice but she doesn't have a personality either
[2:44:46] <+XxBTExX> Equip the pedo materia so you lvl it up while you get to the place
[2:44:53] <arkv01> also is my brain making shit up or does the bunny race kidnap human men and force them to breed?
[2:45:08] <rubbishbinge> Viera are born from trees or something
[2:45:15] <%laserbeaming> Does Quina count? Kappa
[2:45:16] <Brainworm205> I think part of Fran’s appeal is balancing Balthier’s attitude too. They’re a strong team. They’re strongest when they’re on-screen together.
[2:45:21] <GiygasDrillBreak> Fran is so boooring. Freya is superior
[2:45:42] <+LordSDB> Viera are more interesting in the Tactic games
[2:45:42] <MrHappyFunshine> probably my favourite is Agrias from Tactics
[2:45:46] <arkv01> ffxii would've been a lot stronger without the street rats
[2:45:50] <%laserbeaming> Agrias is good
[2:45:51] <seth45er> Fran is sexy Chewbacca
[2:45:54] <ScreamLord> And then in X-2 she get turned into a Broodmare
[2:45:57] <Flamethrowerman09> I've heard most of the FF12 main characters are not that great, especially Vaan.
[2:46:03] <%Samex_Comex> She marries Wakka
[2:46:13] <sosuke5> Lulu shines when she's giving Wakka his 4 pm dick flattening
[2:46:17] <+XxBTExX> Balthier, Fran and Basch are great
[2:46:19] <arkv01> ironically ff12 has some cool characters that are heavily dragged down by vaan and his girl
[2:46:23] <CaptainFrankincense> theres beatrix too
[2:46:32] <Brainworm205> @flamethrowerman09 Vaan and Panelo are pretty bland. But the rest of em are great tbh
[2:46:34] <arkv01> literal waste of screen time, vaan and his squeeze
[2:46:42] <+XxBTExX> Penelo
[2:46:48] <+LordSDB> Balthier is the best char from 12 without questions, everyone else in the main cast will vary person to person
[2:46:52] <%laserbeaming> Most of the stuff I like of XII is because of the english voice acting
[2:46:53] <GeltonZ> @Flamethrowerman09 Vaan is sorta over-hated due to the fact that he was never meant to be the main character. He's alright though. Team cheerleader.
[2:46:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> not that im saying Freya is some great amazing life of the party, no. Freya is quiet but is frank with her thoughts. if she says something, she thought about it and means it.
[2:46:56] <rubbishbinge> Colosseum is the premiere grind spot, you can get another set of SP books and Lv.2 Limits too
[2:46:57] <Brainworm205> But I even like Vaan and Panelo at times. But XII is my favorite in the series so I’m biased
[2:47:08] <examplez0> Does Yuna have a personality outside of being another "good girl"?
[2:47:10] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ What are you doing here?
[2:47:13] <kentrix11> This is the most, "I can't wait for the ps5 with it's absurd SSD to eliminate characters going through hallways to mask loading"
[2:47:16] <%laserbeaming> XII would be better if you replaced Vaan for a Moogle and Penelo for a Baanga
[2:47:25] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:47:26] <arkv01> yuna's basically an anime shrine maiden until x-2
[2:47:28] <GeltonZ> 12 is my favorite 3D Final Fantasy. It reminds me the most of the good old days.
[2:47:30] <%laserbeaming> Change Penelo for Miguelo!
[2:47:35] <%laserbeaming> That would be great
[2:47:39] <+LordSDB> The ds sequal to 12 really help grow Vann and Penelo characters
[2:47:51] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay I'm watching Plague hate this game on one screen while watching Max love it on the other.
[2:47:53] <rubbishbinge> no one played revenant wings tho
[2:47:59] <Hoarseplay> @examplez0 She has heterochromia and also guns in X-2.
[2:48:02] <Brainworm205> @lordsdb oh yea! I always forget that game exists lol
[2:48:11] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Sad like Tifa
[2:48:15] <+0ni0n_L0rd> and her tits
[2:48:16] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> paranoid of people hiding in corners''darksouls intensifies''
[2:48:19] <+LordSDB> Hey at least 12 of us played it @rubbishbinge Kappa
[2:48:29] <%laserbeaming> Save the Birb to breed it in the next Episode
[2:48:33] <Hoarseplay> @GeltonZ Yeah, that sounds like you. I founds a game I want to stream tomorrow. It's hard and a bit jank, but fun.
[2:48:34] <MrHappyFunshine> I tend to like more upbeat characters that have plenty of reason not to be
[2:48:40] <SupportWriter> Where does Barret keep his ammo
[2:48:42] <examplez0> @Hoarseplay I guess X-2 was good for something after all
[2:48:50] <+LordSDB> @Brainworm205 If you play FF Tactics Grimore Rift you get Vann with a pirate shirt
[2:49:00] <Hoarseplay> @examplez0 X-2 is a trip.
[2:49:00] <Brainworm205> @mrhappyfunshine like Vanille? Lol
[2:49:04] <GeltonZ> @Hoarseplay Nice.
[2:49:08] <%laserbeaming> Vaan looks SO MUCH BETTER WITH A SHIRT
[2:49:09] <arkv01> I didn't appreciate X-2 until a lot later
[2:49:13] <rubbishbinge> @LordSDB only played for that top tier Shiva design Kappa
[2:49:20] <MrHappyFunshine> Who was Vannile again?
[2:49:25] <%laserbeaming> It makes him so much less punchable
[2:49:33] <+ziplockfriday> dam still in midgar
[2:49:38] <+aspirationdeath> @examplez0 savior complex and stretched too thin with everyones hopes resting on hee shoulders. she also wants for normalcy but feels guilty
[2:49:39] <GeltonZ> @MrHappyFunshine The pink haired shitty Rikku from FF13.
[2:49:41] <examplez0> @Hoarseplay It's better than anything in the compilation I will give it that much
[2:49:42] <Brainworm205> Vanille was from XIII. Way upbeat when she really shouldn’t be lol
[2:49:52] <arkv01> I mean the avalanche crew bonded with cloud and they became buds
[2:49:55] <rubbishbinge> They're buddy cops but criminals
[2:49:58] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes I think my favorite thing about Final Fantasy as a franchise is how every game is set in a different universe with familiar themes
[2:50:08] <MrHappyFunshine> Oh right, XIII is kinda blocked from my mind, the only thing i remember is lightning
[2:50:10] <+LordSDB> Okay your not wrong, FF 12 shiva got a sick design @rubbishbinge ...wait is it fetish wear.. doodWAT
[2:50:15] <Hoarseplay> @examplez0 I guess? I stopped paying any attention to FF by that point.
[2:50:29] <%laserbeaming> FF12 didn't have shiva? It had Mateus
[2:50:40] <%laserbeaming> Which was the Emperor from FF2, possessing a girl
[2:50:40] <arkv01> ff12 was all FFT zdoiac summons
[2:50:44] <BillieNoMates> Probably the same but a melee hit
[2:50:46] <Explodincatz> rip and tear!
[2:50:51] <BillieNoMates> So it'd be Focused Hit
[2:51:02] <rubbishbinge> FF12 Revenant Wings had the traditional summons
[2:51:09] <BillieNoMates> added effect
[2:51:15] <rubbishbinge> and shiva was bangin'
[2:51:36] <mrgaster8> hey chat and plague how do you think their going to transfer our save data to part 2 for ps5? or are they just going to make u start from 0 again ?
[2:51:36] <+LordSDB> @laserbeaming Ty, I always think shiva when I see her
[2:51:44] <GeltonZ> I was so happy when World of Final Fantasy finally gave me girl Ifrit...shame about the game though.
[2:52:04] <Explodincatz> seems garbage
[2:52:08] <CaptainFrankincense> iftits
[2:52:24] <%laserbeaming> World of FF Girl Ifrit is great.
[2:52:30] <%laserbeaming> Ifrita?
[2:52:37] <kentrix11> @mrgaster8 I think you will just start at level like 35 or smt.
[2:52:37] <GeltonZ> Efreeta, yeah
[2:52:47] <arkv01> hot flaming djinn girl, mmm
[2:52:52] <+LordSDB> Ifrita Chan Kappa
[2:52:54] <SilverRoddo> Do materia have souls, thus have an ethereal human body for having-a-body sake?
[2:53:09] <%laserbeaming> Well, not Djinn, those are wind based. It's... well an Ifrit
[2:53:35] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes Barret's special skill, it says charge while it's on cooldown remember?
[2:53:42] <rubbishbinge> Increases the gauge for Overcharge
[2:54:01] <+XxBTExX> Life Stream in anal bead form
[2:54:05] <arkv01> people juice
[2:54:06] <Bardofkeys> Air to ice to water?
[2:54:16] <NineBall3D> lol
[2:54:36] <BillieNoMates> All life*
[2:54:48] <arkv01> its crystallized magic tomes
[2:54:55] <+RealThiele> green materia is people!
[2:55:02] <Futurecity10> Kinda explains summon materia then
[2:55:05] <SilverRoddo> Ah, Olaf’s water holds memories theory.
[2:55:05] <Bardofkeys> Now id you excuse me i'm going to use this mans soul to power some not so wholesome things.
[2:55:05] <%laserbeaming> Is selling maxed out materia equivalent to Ghost Slavery?
[2:55:15] <kentrix11> He's super unga
[2:55:18] <BillieNoMates> Barret is a coolguy
[2:55:29] <BillieNoMates> Barret is a warboss now
[2:55:30] <Kampler21> what does lifesaver do?
[2:55:32] <arkv01> @laserbeaming soul trafficking
[2:55:33] <BillieNoMates> Living in a junkheap
[2:55:39] <BillieNoMates> He's literally an ork
[2:55:51] <Bardofkeys> Ok is Baret's head small or is his upper body just that big?
[2:55:51] <SilverRoddo> His name is Clamps now.
[2:55:53] <arkv01> oh poor widdle cheeken
[2:55:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:55:56] <Frankomancer> kweh kwehh
[2:55:59] <%Samex_Comex> Ah dragon!
[2:56:10] <rubbishbinge> this one's a problem
[2:56:21] <%laserbeaming> That's a cute dragon. Quick! Lewd it!
[2:56:23] <mrgaster8> @kentrix11 probley
[2:56:29] <+LordSDB> Why is Barret trying to kick it LUL
[2:56:31] <BillieNoMates> It's chadley drake
[2:56:36] <mrgaster8> wops
[2:56:37] <BillieNoMates> Kill him for glory
[2:56:38] <arkv01> watch out, this drake will inflict (tetanus)
[2:56:49] <+ziplockfriday> this whole game seems to be in a junkyard
[2:56:58] <rubbishbinge> MAXIMUM FURY
[2:57:03] <%laserbeaming> So... Cast Magic Missile into the Darkness?
[2:57:06] <kentrix11> It's a shame Barret doesn't have his long range arm now.+
[2:57:06] <Frankomancer> did the original ff7 have descriptions for enemies?
[2:57:13] <NineBall3D> @PlagueOfGripes bro i just wanna say that your vid on naruto is fucking incredible. you are a legend for tht. PogChamp PogChamp
[2:57:24] <examplez0> No it didn't
[2:57:26] <+LordSDB> Oh yeah he got a claw gun now
[2:57:39] <examplez0> Sense only gave their name, HP and elemental weakness
[2:57:46] <+RealThiele> sags them tiddies
[2:57:58] <rubbishbinge> It sucks that Barret's melee is ground only
[2:58:13] <arkv01> yeah it would be goofy if barret does super jumps
[2:58:14] <examplez0> I never used melee weapons for Barret
[2:58:18] <arkv01> would open up a lot of questions
[2:58:35] <examplez0> I have so many other melee characters to choose from
[2:58:37] <ScreamLord> I hate that fox thing
[2:58:49] <Bardofkeys> corgi carbunkle is still something I gotta get used to.
[2:58:52] <%Samex_Comex> It's in my recommendations a lot
[2:58:53] <sosuke5> It made some people very upset
[2:58:55] <kentrix11> I'm surprised you watched all of kai for a joke video
[2:59:00] <SilverRoddo> I want Barret to have a big dumb morning star on his arm. Axe-head, whip, sword, bigger sword etc.
[2:59:09] <Kampler21> Your gripe videos are great LUL
[2:59:15] <%laserbeaming> It was an actual analysis, would people have watched it?
[2:59:21] <%laserbeaming> if it*
[2:59:22] <Bardofkeys> Ok jesus christ their talons are huge
[2:59:41] <Huntercd> Is that a Pomeranian?
[2:59:42] <kentrix11> Why did you put so much effort into a joke video?
[2:59:46] <ckkc1> Your Gohan video was pretty nice
[2:59:53] <Bardofkeys> Like if that thing lashes out in fear your innards are just on the ground now
[3:00:00] <NineBall3D> LOL
[3:00:03] <arkv01> LUL these fandoms
[3:00:10] <ahaegotrigger> oh christ LUL
[3:00:17] <+XxBTExX> This video touched my pee pee
[3:00:23] <+LordSDB> I enjoy you breaking down the many time lines of DBZ, and the Gohan video
[3:00:31] <arkv01> thanks plague, your sterling analysis saved my marriage
[3:00:32] <EuropanLamprey> the tien video?
[3:00:36] <Ralfclogs> I love the gohan one
[3:00:50] <theloganbrand> More facts then the local news.
[3:00:55] <BillieNoMates> Shut up, Tien.
[3:00:57] <%JailShmixRemix> Plague's analysis saved my dogs life
[3:01:00] <SilverRoddo> It has the feel of facts.
[3:01:00] <kentrix11> A god lie is usually hidden between a lot of truth, so that was a bad choice.
[3:01:03] <arkv01> shut up and fuck paozu, tien
[3:01:04] <ScreamLord> More Ghosts
[3:01:07] <mrgaster8> kids goost
[3:01:07] <%laserbeaming> I know nothing of Naruto, really can't tell which is fact and which is not concerning it
[3:01:08] <+TheRealMasterof7s> But the internetz is serious businezz
[3:01:19] <+ziplockfriday> so you telling me it's fake news
[3:02:10] <mrgaster8> how do u feel about that when you get those type of comments
[3:02:19] <Rodzzila> did you get some "you ruined my life" to compensate? LUL
[3:02:22] <%laserbeaming> Well, I wouldn't call Naruto "News"
[3:02:24] <Bardofkeys> "You trash talking this orange asian kid gave me the boost in confidence I needed"
[3:02:42] <CaptainFrankincense> "this video killed me"
[3:02:55] <Bardofkeys> @captainfrankincense Ima ghost now
[3:03:02] <%Samex_Comex> Oh shit he's the boss
[3:03:04] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Hey, you make me happy Plague :D

[3:04:10] <ahaegotrigger> despite only being 13 percent of the enemies in the game
[3:04:12] <kentrix11> Counter state doesnt work against the frozen claws for some bloody reason.
[3:04:19] <Jack_O_Valentino> The "Villains" video you did was my favorite.
[3:04:19] <kentrix11> I think it's because of the element.
[3:04:33] <Explodincatz> blue magic?
[3:04:44] <VERDAXY> do the enemies respawn here?
[3:04:46] <arran_throttle> @PlagueOfGripes you inspired me to write a comic book

[3:09:39] <kentrix11> her dream is dancing, not being a prostitute.
[3:09:43] <%CyberDingus> "I always dreamed to be a whore, please don't tell the kids''
[3:09:49] <Sokumotanaka> Blacksona...
[3:09:52] <DotDusk> Stop asking questions and enjoy the show.
[3:10:15] <rubbishbinge> Still need a behemoth horn
[3:10:18] <kentrix11> I mean there's not much reason to bring that up.
[3:10:25] <arkv01> the moogle kid sells artillery?
[3:10:41] <Sokumotanaka> She dreamed of dancing on a stage not being a whore that's something you guys made up
[3:10:59] <arkv01> I mean the honeybee inn is a whorehouse/entertainment venue
[3:11:05] <arkv01> 50/50 on the whore theory
[3:12:09] <Sokumotanaka> She isn't sleeping around with he other partrons and in this version it's also changed to be a theater for some reason
[3:12:23] <%CyberDingus> @Sokumotanaka \wooooooshhh\
[3:12:27] <Futurecity10> morter, like morter and pestle
[3:13:23] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus Can you woosh a person for a conversation you aren't even involved in? Or aren't aware of?
[3:13:52] <%CyberDingus> @Sokumotanaka people are making jokes. You take them at face value. You are being silly.
[3:14:55] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus Mind reader huh? I'm however not fighting other people's battles for them. I disagree with it simple
[3:15:15] <Sokumotanaka> Everyone things their a mindreader
[3:15:33] <+aspirationdeath> @sokumotanaka have some respect for sex worker. she cant suck dick when shes not teaching orphans?
[3:15:51] <NineBall3D> LUL
[3:15:52] <+aspirationdeath> seems like youre in denial
[3:15:54] <Futurecity10> Anyone just really hate clouds current sword? It looks so ugly
[3:16:00] <Sokumotanaka> @aspirationdeath I just don't agree she is one
[3:16:12] <%CyberDingus> @Sokumotanaka and the chat just makes jokes.
[3:16:15] <KaiserMario> Oh... here she goes agaon... The Sealion is back...
[3:16:15] <arkv01> the hard edge used to be a less curvy IIRC
[3:16:26] <%Samex_Comex> Choo choo
[3:17:13] <Sokumotanaka> @CyberDingus As you said
[3:17:33] <+aspirationdeath> @sokumotanaka did you miss the optional cutscene where she eats clouds chocolate starfish for a healing materia?
[3:18:02] <GenericTwitchAcc1> SourPls
[3:18:40] <%CyberDingus> @Sokumotanaka are you having a crush on the delicious brown teacher? :y
[3:18:49] <arkv01> I kinda wish we'd get the wallmarket jam actually in wall market, kinda wasted on the highway
[3:19:10] <+logoth_> I hate to say, but the new wall market theme isnt great
[3:19:29] <arkv01> understandable, some people might not enjoy the techno bits
[3:19:48] <Sokumotanaka> @aspirationdeath @CyberDingus Okay we get it you don't get much attention at home, you both got hands, jack each other off and leave me outta it. Cool? Cool
[3:20:27] <%CyberDingus> you forgot to tip your fedora :u
[3:20:36] <kentrix11> Honestly the whole stunlocking stuff never bothered me at all until like, end game and even then it was "Oh ok I just have to avoid a few things to not get stunned"
[3:20:42] <Sokumotanaka> Im honestly surprised with how much they kiss AC's butt their AC outfits aren't optional
[3:20:49] <kentrix11> But the optional fights are gicing me a lot of pain.
[3:21:56] <hcsarg1986> Has he beaten the main story/
[3:22:02] <hcsarg1986> ?
[3:22:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> just like the original game!
[3:22:05] <rubbishbinge> There's a materia that increases ATB gain wile guarding
[3:22:11] <rubbishbinge> while*
[3:22:14] <arkv01> well that's not good, back to the QA dungeons LUL
[3:22:16] <ZE_Count> video games
[3:22:36] <Sokumotanaka> So you cant get back to the church and get that materia till a special cutscene?
[3:22:38] <rubbishbinge> He fires tiny crabs
[3:23:06] <Frankomancer> it was just a chakra materia
[3:23:33] <kentrix11> Just cast thunder right away.
[3:23:41] <ZE_Count> I just hit them with thunder
[3:23:44] <Sokumotanaka> You can't thunder them?
[3:23:49] <$jamarartdoodles> Actually a decent track. Very cyber like
[3:24:25] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes Plague you really need to use elemental spells against this guys a lot more.
[3:25:22] <kentrix11> @PlagueOfGripes the basic ones are fast and pressure them easy.
[3:25:38] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> aren you going backward plague?
[3:25:41] <rubbishbinge> Magnify does wonders too
[3:25:43] <arkv01> getting bred by facehggers
[3:25:54] <Sokumotanaka> The heck's magnify?

[3:26:23] <+axenred> PLague, how long have you been playing this game total?
[3:26:29] <%JailShmixRemix> No backseating :P
[3:26:31] <rubbishbinge> Magnify turns spells into big AOEs

[3:28:32] <Sokumotanaka> @Samex_Comex Wouldn't you if you saw that thing?
[3:29:10] <BillieNoMates> So do you not get a free level 1 of a materia if you master it?
[3:29:17] <Sokumotanaka> Pray for Aerith's butthole

[3:31:00] <arkv01> waow, fission mailed
[3:32:13] <+Joe2187> not a fan of the combat flow myself
[3:32:14] <rubbishbinge> it's not too bad, they take big damage after you kill the clone
[3:32:16] <ZE_Count> the clones names are different
[3:32:31] <Explodincatz> theres 3
[3:32:49] <MilkingEdge> milk them for exp
[3:33:15] <rubbishbinge> Clone will be called Proto something
[3:33:23] <hcsarg1986> Have you defeated the main story?
[3:33:38] <Sokumotanaka> This BGM ain't it chief DansGame
[3:33:42] <Kampler21> not yet

[3:35:20] <hcsarg1986> @Kampler21 Okay good thanks
[3:35:37] <SilverRoddo> The Dash card?
[3:35:41] <ZE_Count> Fivehead Carbuckle
[3:35:43] <arkv01> carbuncle had a hard life
[3:35:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> Carbuncle was original a huge alien wolf
[3:35:51] <MilkingEdge> big brain
[3:35:52] <BillieNoMates> Fennec or the lizard abortion monster from VIII
[3:35:52] <GiygasDrillBreak> cuz i remember FF5
[3:35:58] <Sokumotanaka> Worked out at the library
[3:36:33] <SilverRoddo> Steal their magic?
[3:36:37] <rubbishbinge> Use an ability when they're dancing
[3:36:43] <BillieNoMates> They arent hard
[3:36:45] <BillieNoMates> Just long
[3:36:52] <%Samex_Comex> This rave is crazy
[3:36:59] <Sokumotanaka> @BillieNoMates That's what she said
[3:37:05] <Frankomancer> jesus these are serious sponges
[3:37:13] <rubbishbinge> When they replicate hey make a weaker clone and when you kill that clone the original takes a lot of damage
[3:37:21] <terminusterminal> Do these enemies lose health when they clone?
[3:37:29] <terminusterminal> The scan didn't mention
[3:37:39] <rubbishbinge> They take a shit ton of damage when you kill the clone
[3:37:43] <kentrix11> @rubbishbinge Oh so you HAVE to make them duplicte to cause damage?
[3:37:53] <rubbishbinge> Yep
[3:38:01] <BillieNoMates> You need to spawn the clones and then kill the clones for damage apparently
[3:38:33] <hcsarg1986> @BillieNoMates What a great mechanic
[3:38:52] <BillieNoMates> Dont blame me. Im not Nomura
[3:39:04] <Sokumotanaka> That's JUST what nomura would say
[3:39:27] <hcsarg1986> @BillieNoMates I'm not Just being sarcastic in general
[3:39:29] <rubbishbinge> It said defeat the clones to effectively deal with them, it got me confused t first too
[3:39:57] <SilverRoddo> Geistzeit, i figured it out. (pats own back)
[3:40:00] <%JailShmixRemix> these things really are just sponges
[3:40:06] <mrgaster8> the bit took me a min to beat
[3:40:20] <Frankomancer> what kind of enemy creates clones that damage it when they die? Doesnt that completely defeat the purpose of making clones
[3:40:45] <hcsarg1986> @Frankomancer Shut up though
[3:41:09] <%JailShmixRemix> I wonder how much a limit does
[3:41:19] <MilkingEdge> Beat em like you beat your meat
[3:41:38] <ZE_Count> looked cool tho
[3:42:32] <ZE_Count> luv bird
[3:42:38] <Explodincatz> it would have been better if the info was accurate
[3:42:54] <MilkingEdge> As a black man Barret likes Kentucky Fried Chocobo
[3:43:20] <hcsarg1986> Chocobo are so cute
[3:43:24] <examplez0> He's angry and he swears a lot
[3:43:25] <Frankomancer> lol yes exactly
[3:43:35] <arkv01> he's mr T, no one questions mr T
[3:43:36] <examplez0> That's apparently enough to make him a stereotype
[3:43:38] <chergarr> he's a stereotypical 80s black tough action movie guy
[3:43:44] <%CyberDingus> gravel gravel
[3:43:56] <OToole42> I like his nervous tic of scratching at the union point of his gun arm
[3:44:00] <examplez0> Even though he never once calls anyone "cracker" or "white boi"
[3:44:03] <Maids4lyfe> fake beard with his fake sam eliot voice
[3:44:04] <Explodincatz> teh NPCs look like fake people
[3:44:22] <SilverRoddo> His beard’s weird.
[3:44:27] <mrgaster8> hey @PlagueOfGripes been watching woolies kotor 2 streams and thought what is your fav character and moments if u played the game
[3:44:29] <%CyberDingus> lewd!
[3:44:32] <%Samex_Comex> Caw!
[3:44:36] <examplez0> Even the NPC interactions in FF10 looked better than this
[3:44:42] <Sokumotanaka> They did stereotype him with him being angry and a comic relief alot more than he used to
[3:44:43] <BillieNoMates> Loose like a saudi's wallet
[3:44:54] <rubbishbinge> One of the characters beard is literally not even attached to his face
[3:45:00] <Sokumotanaka> It's not as bad but there's some still there
[3:45:23] <ZE_Count> Might wanna check out the weapon shop in wall market.
[3:45:24] <examplez0> Yeah he's much more over the top in the remake
[3:45:36] <MilkingEdge> glue on beard
[3:45:37] <arkv01> please join woolie for his post kotor2 discussion on the podcast <3
[3:46:37] <BillieNoMates> Did audio just die ?
[3:46:44] <@dcn2049> Just you
[3:46:48] <BillieNoMates> Huh weird
[3:47:01] <%Samex_Comex> Space is cool
[3:47:02] <examplez0> Ooooh pretty lights
[3:47:02] <mrgaster8> nope
[3:47:07] <Frankomancer> they wanted to make something flashy like Persona 5's but failed horribly at it
[3:47:16] <Explodincatz> fashion over function strikes again
[3:47:16] <@dcn2049> it looks like a total pain in the ass to control
[3:47:19] <examplez0> It looks like the crystarium from FF13
[3:47:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:47:26] <MilkingEdge> Nomura: IT LOOKS KOOL
[3:47:28] <terminusterminal> Do these boosts work in general or for the specific weapon?
[3:47:29] <sosuke5> FF peaked with the FF10 sphere grid
[3:47:34] <terminusterminal> This seems like the magic weapon
[3:47:53] <terminusterminal> Oh well there you go
[3:47:59] <examplez0> It wouldn't be a Square Enix game if it wasn't unnecessarily flashy and garish
[3:48:01] <SilverRoddo> When’s Roche g0nNa shOw uP.?
[3:48:02] <kentrix11> @Frankomancer I'm really tired of people going "oh it's trying to have a good looking UI so it was trying to be P5"
[3:48:10] <hcsarg1986> I like this music What's wrong with it?
[3:48:19] <Frankomancer> oh im not saying P5 created good looking UI
[3:48:20] <mrgaster8> @examplez0 lol
[3:48:22] <examplez0> Persona 5 invented good looking UIs
[3:48:32] <Maids4lyfe> ye
[3:48:46] <Frankomancer> just that P5 is the latest big JRPG they were probably paying attention to while making this
[3:48:56] <arkv01> now pat is the orb of fart :(
[3:48:58] <+eanscrale> That doesn't sound that far off from sticky white stuff
[3:49:10] <mrgaster8> big pat orb
[3:49:22] <MilkingEdge> farts spread orb fart keep a shape
[3:49:38] <hcsarg1986> Pats head looks like an orb
[3:49:50] <Explodincatz> u bought the 1 at the start
[3:49:51] <mrgaster8> what kind of shape do fart orb make
[3:50:09] <ZE_Count> Im grinding Revival material such a pain.
[3:50:14] <SilverRoddo> plagueGripes
[3:50:15] <MilkingEdge> @mrgaster8 orb shape
[3:50:23] <arkv01> is there an optimal grind zone at this point?
[3:50:32] <arkv01> where do we get huge
[3:50:32] <+StreamStopA> Go fight the angle of the slums.
[3:50:33] <mrgaster8> booo lame
[3:50:34] <ZE_Count> Have ya checked out the weapon shop in wall market?
[3:50:40] <rubbishbinge> Colosseum is the grind spot
[3:50:49] <kentrix11> @Frankomancer Yeah I know is just everyone just goes "this new rpg was trying to be p5" because p5 is the only rpg that isn't cringe to like nowdays.
[3:51:03] <terminusterminal> This game really likes children, huh?
[3:51:10] <arkv01> think, betty, gotta upload new jams to soundcloud!
[3:51:10] <ckkc1> SourPls
[3:51:37] <terminusterminal> Did nobody we know die in that plate fall other than Jessie?
[3:51:54] <sosuke5> It's the child that created the Aerith ghost
[3:51:54] <examplez0> @kentrix11 Even though it has the same stuff that makes people cringe in other JRPGs for some reason Persona gets a free pass
[3:52:18] <hcsarg1986> Denzel will be DLC Don't you worry plague
[3:52:30] <terminusterminal> Do Denzel and Chadley have the same hairstyle?
[3:52:33] <rubbishbinge> He's busy dying from geostigma
[3:52:38] <MilkingEdge> Play that funky music plague
[3:52:43] <ZE_Count> Little Girl says to party because her cats are dead.
[3:52:47] <kentrix11> @examplez0 It's because the first chapter is fairly down to earth even if the rest is anime trope jokes that hurt the themes the game stablishes.
[3:52:58] <Frankomancer> they demand CHOCOBO
[3:52:59] <SilverRoddo> Distant Woman: “Leave me be.”
[3:52:59] <%JailShmixRemix> Stamp is a good song
[3:53:00] <examplez0> There should be three other songs around Wall Market that are used here
[3:53:04] <+XxBTExX> Costa del Sol
[3:53:06] <+StreamStopA> My family is dead but this song is great.
[3:53:08] <kentrix11> @examplez0 So most critics gave it high scores.
[3:53:09] <rubbishbinge> The right songs will be marked with quest markers
[3:53:12] <Kampler21> Imagine if the game allowed you to set your own overworld and battle music as it literally gives you music tracks like candy
[3:53:14] <rubbishbinge> don't bother right now
[3:53:25] <examplez0> @kentrix11 Because most critic don't play beyond the first few hours
[3:53:27] <+XxBTExX> Tango of Tears
[3:53:29] <ZE_Count> You gotta find the music around wall market.
[3:53:37] <%JailShmixRemix> Evil jingle
[3:53:38] <hcsarg1986> Costa de sol or Gold Saucer
[3:53:44] <+StreamStopA> Electric chokabo
[3:53:49] <examplez0> There should be a song at the inn and two more in around the market

[3:55:14] <Jrockoni> never have I seen a name so awful
[3:55:23] <+XxBTExX> Clearly Chadley is the name for the Chad of all Chads
[3:55:30] <Sokumotanaka> Nice!
[3:55:33] <MilkingEdge> Chadmeister
[3:55:35] <examplez0> Is there anybody actually waiting to buy FF7R a year later on Xbox One
[3:55:44] <+samirrsp> deadly dodge
[3:55:47] <+XxBTExX> Chadley is the name of a guy who fucks
[3:55:52] <terminusterminal> It might do low damage. I'd say deadly dodge
[3:55:55] <OToole42> I'm a cheap bastard waiting for the three game boxed set
[3:56:06] <rubbishbinge> Deadly Dodge
[3:56:07] <Sokumotanaka> That can turn out super broken I bet in the full game you'll get that later or it'll get nerfed
[3:56:28] <rubbishbinge> Tifa's deadly dodge at max chi stomps hard
[3:56:34] <arkv01> what if it just nullifies the heal by sucking it from you D:
[3:56:36] <examplez0> We don't know if it will just be three episodes anymore
[3:56:53] <OToole42> doesn't matter, I'll still wait
[3:56:55] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @examplez0 No, but I am waiting until the price drops because I'm broke.
[3:57:12] <OToole42> why spend up to 290 bucks
[3:57:23] <OToole42> when I can spend faar far less
[3:57:32] <OToole42> and get to eat
[3:57:37] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Exactly.
[3:57:47] <OToole42> ^
[3:58:40] <+RooddlesMcgriF> the weapon shop has a new sword
[3:58:54] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Is the new sword any good?
[3:59:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> is the new sword a force stealer?
[3:59:12] <+RooddlesMcgriF> it's ok, it's the mythril sword
[3:59:22] <examplez0> It's the strongest but has less materia slots
[3:59:26] <rubbishbinge> New sword is the magic sword for cloud, gives him blade beam or whatever
[3:59:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> oh so he has to buy the mithril saber
[3:59:40] <examplez0> The buster sword is still the best all-rounder
[3:59:52] <arkv01> well hello madam mommy
[3:59:54] <examplez0> Once you've upgraded it enough
[4:00:31] <+RooddlesMcgriF> the weapon shop near Don Cornholyos mansion

[4:04:05] <Glassbrain> The abdomen juts forward.
[4:04:05] <arkv01> 4'11" vs 5'
[4:04:06] <+XxBTExX> Sephiroth looks like he's 7.6
[4:04:08] <Glassbrain> It’s weird.
[4:04:16] <+XxBTExX> Cloud is probably like 4"11
[4:04:18] <Maids4lyfe> Cloud is a manlet
[4:04:25] <%JailShmixRemix> How tall is barrete
[4:04:25] <%squatting_eagle> Asian problems
[4:04:27] <+whiskey_wolfe_> das japan
[4:04:31] <GeltonZ> This is normal. You should look up how tall people are in Soul Calibur. It's hilarious.
[4:04:31] <TyrianPurpleHaze> That's because they're all Japanese.
[4:04:32] <terminusterminal> 5"11 vs 6"0. Manlets. When will they learn.
[4:04:32] <OToole42> poor nutrition in Midgar
[4:04:32] <ZE_Count> Time Retcon height!
[4:04:32] <Sokumotanaka> I'm taller than cloud? HA manlet
[4:04:34] <+LordSDB> Seph is 6'1" I've been told
[4:04:40] <examplez0> Sephiroth is 6' 1"

[4:04:57] <+LordSDB> Ha! I'm taller than cloud!
[4:05:03] <@dcn2049> Fatemaster?
[4:05:04] <Glassbrain> plagueGripes_TK Yes.

[4:06:39] <TyrianPurpleHaze> God damn it, I'm the same height as Cloud.
[4:06:41] <Sokumotanaka> @arkv01 Why are you so small LUL
[4:06:49] <+LordSDB> Everyone taller than cloud, except Pat woolieSMUG
[4:06:51] <+XxBTExX> Condoms and tools for botched abortions
[4:06:57] <VeryTricky> Swirly straw
[4:07:15] <arkv01> is this the abortion hut?
[4:07:15] <hcsarg1986> @TyrianPurpleHaze You got off easy I'm smaller than Gary Coleman
[4:07:19] <GiygasDrillBreak> Sephy's height was never officially given in japanese, only english materials stated 6'1" for him, but this makes no sense for Crisis Core that officially states Zack as 6'3" while Sephiroth is almost a head taller
[4:07:33] <%CyberDingus> Cloud played it cool
[4:07:38] <+RooddlesMcgriF> it's a shitty hotel room in a run down town it's probably what you think it is
[4:07:55] <Sokumotanaka> HOT
[4:07:58] <Frankomancer> who asks permission to listen to music on a jukebox
[4:08:02] <%CyberDingus> you've got a big mouth lady
[4:08:05] <arkv01> watch the child jam!
[4:08:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> Sephy is always extremely tall compared to other characters in all his appearances, except other obscenely tall people.
[4:08:29] <MilkingEdge> Bust a move kid
[4:08:45] <%Samex_Comex> Oh no Old man!

[4:13:28] <TonberryLives> It*
[4:13:30] <GiygasDrillBreak> did eli look left in the weapon shop?
[4:13:37] <+RooddlesMcgriF> weapon shop
[4:13:45] <examplez0> It'll encourage them to Still More Fighting
[4:13:47] <terminusterminal> Looks like a magic based weapon again
[4:13:51] <arkv01> straight from LOTR
[4:13:54] <terminusterminal> You wanna make cloud a caster?
[4:13:58] <GiygasDrillBreak> ahaha the TANK
[4:14:01] <examplez0> It'll encourage them to Those Who Fight Further
[4:14:13] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Cloud's gonna feel so weird wearing a sword made for normal human beings.
[4:14:14] <examplez0> It's pretty tedious
[4:14:30] <hcsarg1986> Why do so many characters in this game look like hipsters?
[4:14:31] <+RooddlesMcgriF> that bat kills me everytime I see it lol
[4:14:52] <rubbishbinge> it's neat that the bat changes punisher mode at least
[4:14:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> probably because the developers dress like hipsters at the office
[4:15:40] <hcsarg1986> @GiygasDrillBreak And now I hate people I don't even know.
[4:15:51] <terminusterminal> A shame there is no non-elemental materia to use with "Elemental".
[4:16:06] <terminusterminal> So you have to roll the dice if you want to use normal attacks with mythril stuff
[4:16:11] <suitangi021> Slots on slots on slots
[4:17:12] <+RooddlesMcgriF> plague go visit the moogle kid for a new weapon for Berret
[4:17:22] <terminusterminal> Oh no I forgot about the moogle kid.
[4:17:35] <rubbishbinge> @RooddlesMcgriF He already got the crab claw
[4:18:04] <+shootbang_exe> you can press r1 to bring up all characters at once for materia
[4:18:16] <@dcn2049> CONTENT!
[4:18:17] <+shootbang_exe> don't wanna @ him tho
[4:18:29] <+r_squared1672> just tuning in, how far is Plague in the game?
[4:18:39] <+RooddlesMcgriF> @rubbishbinge he did? that's cool then
[4:18:43] <+shootbang_exe> Hey plague pressing R1 will bring up all characters materia at once
[4:19:11] <examplez0> FF7 Materia Simulator
[4:20:10] <suitangi021> Why's there no sort by type or name
[4:20:22] <examplez0> It's already sorted by type
[4:20:22] <rubbishbinge> wait what, mine are sorted by type
[4:20:24] <$vampireinarm> because eat shit player
[4:20:39] <examplez0> It's also sorted by equipped/unequipped
[4:20:45] <examplez0> Another side quest is back there
[4:20:54] <rubbishbinge> Main story progression!
[4:21:14] <rubbishbinge> There's a chakra materia in the basement if you want it
[4:21:24] <examplez0> Koch is tied up in the rape dungeon
[4:21:35] <examplez0> You can let him out and he gives you materia
[4:22:01] <$vampireinarm> cutscene gun > gameplay gun
[4:22:03] <+StreamStopA> It's a plot hand gun
[4:22:16] <%Samex_Comex> Trucker cap power
[4:22:17] <Jrockoni> bullet to the face works in pretty much every universe sans dbz
[4:22:22] <examplez0> Remember in Advent Children when Cloud was shot in the back by Loz and Yazoo and barely even flinched
[4:22:28] <terminusterminal> Leslie's really up for whatever isn't he?
[4:22:35] <+XxBTExX> Cloud got shot in the head in AC
[4:22:45] <+XxBTExX> his sunglasses just broke
[4:22:46] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Trucker hats are the universal indication that someone's up for anything.
[4:22:58] <examplez0> Bulletproof sunglasses
[4:22:58] <BillieNoMates> That was after a Lifestream dip
[4:23:06] <+RaveBV> Cloud didn't get shot in the head. The bullet missed and zoomed past his glasses, blowing them off.
[4:23:13] <examplez0> Hope you're ready for another side quest in the sewers
[4:23:16] <arkv01> nomura needs more inserts
[4:23:18] <BillieNoMates> and yeah. he got shot but not in the head
[4:23:28] <BillieNoMates> I think he got shot in the chest?
[4:23:29] <+RaveBV> The bullet that shot him in the back literally made him flinch and almost fall over before he charged at loz.
[4:23:30] <MilkingEdge> SAY WAT
[4:23:38] <Maids4lyfe> door guy looks like that guy from kingdom hearts 3
[4:23:40] <+RaveBV> Did you really watch AC? lmao
[4:23:40] <%CyberDingus> thirst

[4:24:01] <+spiegelspike> the corn hole, eh
[4:24:05] <arkv01> bed is welded to the wall huh
[4:24:12] <suitangi021> Dude looks like he's about to go on about darkness and hearts
[4:24:17] <examplez0> I haven't watched it in a long while
[4:24:18] <+XxBTExX> @BillieNoMates he gets shot in the head at the start when he first meets Kadaj Yazoo and Loz
[4:24:25] <+RaveBV> Leslie looks like a KH3 char
[4:24:25] <examplez0> And I don't plan on ever doing so ever again
[4:24:35] <Frankomancer> oh boooo thats lame
[4:24:38] <arkv01> y'all forget ravus from ffxv already
[4:24:50] <Explodincatz> maybe its on the other side of the sword?
[4:24:50] <+RaveBV> He looks like that new guy at the end of KH3
[4:25:06] <+XxBTExX> Yazoo crashes his bike head on, and as its flipping over him he shoots Cloud straight in the head. His goggles get destroyed and he bleeds a little.
[4:25:51] <%Samex_Comex> Get the candle wax
[4:25:56] <+RaveBV> He doesn't shoot cloud directly in the face though. He hits part of his glasses and blows it off.
[4:26:08] <+RaveBV> Yazoo's guns don't even shoot real bullets anyway.
[4:26:18] <%CyberDingus> ew
[4:26:27] <MilkingEdge> Meteria egg
[4:26:38] <Jrockoni> "they just put materia in my ass and left me here."
[4:26:44] <+XxBTExX> @RaveBV pretty sure his goggles are not bullet proof
[4:26:44] <rubbishbinge> chakra is stored in the butt
[4:26:48] <+EpicureanIguana> materia anal beads WutFace
[4:27:05] <MilkingEdge> Smuggling meteria in the butt
[4:27:07] <+RaveBV> They aren't. which is why they exploded off and his face still took damage.
[4:27:10] <+StreamStopA> could have been cut content
[4:27:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[4:28:48] <BillieNoMates> Well it's Midgar. You didn't get a ribbon there, right?
[4:28:54] <BillieNoMates> I remember golden saucer having them
[4:28:58] <BillieNoMates> But not where you get the first

[4:32:07] <+awesomeguy423> SQUATS
[4:32:19] <+awesomeguy423> no squats? aww
[4:32:20] <+RaveBV> padding
[4:32:21] <hcsarg1986> One of this guys is voiced by Arin
[4:32:23] <gunsrlove> ..most women can't even do A pull up
[4:32:28] <%CyberDingus> Tifa, do your best.
[4:32:33] <+awesomeguy423> wait really hcs?
[4:32:36] <%CyberDingus> Pull those huge tits up, girllllll
[4:33:09] <rubbishbinge> ngl I spent over an hour on this mini game
[4:33:12] <+kenuran> Oh i hate minigames like this
[4:33:19] <gunsrlove> Tifa is cheating a bit, too much leg swinging
[4:33:20] <+XxBTExX> lul
[4:33:21] <rubbishbinge> didn't mesh in my brain
[4:33:24] <BillieNoMates> Andi wins!
[4:33:24] <+RaveBV> lol this looks so dumb
[4:33:26] <Jrockoni> SUMMON SQUATICLIES!!!
[4:33:50] <+kenuran> ok\
[4:33:56] <terminusterminal> That looks downright robotic
[4:34:05] <examplez0> Nice
[4:34:07] <examplez0> first try
[4:34:13] <%CyberDingus> by ONE
[4:34:20] <BillieNoMates> Andi's been doing it half the day
[4:34:26] <BillieNoMates> I think this was a bit unfair
[4:34:27] <gunsrlove> So well trained
[4:34:31] <+awesomeguy423> this padding is getting really stupid
[4:34:33] <gunsrlove> but he cranked out like 15
[4:34:39] <gunsrlove> pff
[4:34:50] <Frankomancer> Its not FF7 without mini games
[4:34:53] <%CyberDingus> he can't help it - he is FABULOUS
[4:35:00] <+RaveBV> I wonder how long it takes to finish FF7R from start to finish with all it's padding removed.
[4:35:06] <+StreamStopA> Reps for Jesus.
[4:35:07] <+RaveBV> There's so much of it
[4:35:10] <+kenuran> TJ Combo over here
[4:35:21] <+EpicureanIguana> is.. is that a Ronnie Coleman reference?
[4:35:30] <gunsrlove> Ronnie fell over in ONE bodyweight squat last time, why is he talking tough
[4:35:33] <MilkingEdge> lightweight
[4:35:34] <examplez0> He's challenging a woman half his size
[4:35:39] <%CyberDingus> Tifa is lighter, given that the Vega is much more muscle denser.
[4:36:18] <%deeschlemp451> hey friends. how goes it?
[4:36:22] <+RaveBV> Yeah, Tifa would have the advantage being in shape but still much lighter.
[4:36:37] <gunsrlove> Not entirely how that works
[4:36:48] <%CyberDingus> Even her two fat sacks don't slow her down
[4:36:53] <MilkingEdge> Roid rage
[4:36:53] <cerazor01> he's going to crush Tifa's head with his thighs
[4:37:27] <+StreamStopA> You have to do the pull up game 3 times for the good end
[4:37:31] <VeryTricky> But the belt
[4:37:38] <rubbishbinge> This is technically the point of no return
[4:37:38] <examplez0> You gotta fight in the colisuem for Kyrie
[4:37:57] <@dcn2049> hell yeah Betty!
[4:37:59] <%CyberDingus> the old man
[4:38:03] <%CyberDingus> he is still doing it
[4:38:06] <@dcn2049> Rip and Tear, cat girl!
[4:38:11] <MilkingEdge> ROCK ON!
[4:38:11] <gunsrlove> 4Head Stop
[4:38:13] <%Samex_Comex> Rock on!
[4:38:17] <examplez0> Once he beats the sewer quest with Leslie then it's the point of no return
[4:38:21] <+whiskey_wolfe_> yes
[4:38:28] <+LordSDB> maybe?
[4:38:42] <%CyberDingus> Barret pls
[4:38:49] <arkv01> now look at us barret, from inside the screen
[4:38:57] <SuperVaderMan> Barret, it's charming when you do it after combat, don't do it during cutscenes
[4:38:58] <%Samex_Comex> Old man still has the moves
[4:39:02] <%CyberDingus> Barret is self-aware.
[4:39:18] <+thefakeh> lulu?
[4:39:24] <%CyberDingus> "you bad boy''
[4:39:29] <%CyberDingus> w-wew!
[4:39:33] <arkv01> lulu sounds raspier
[4:39:37] <arkv01> could be she cleared up her throat
[4:39:40] <examplez0> Her name is Mallory Low
[4:39:44] <%CyberDingus> quited smoking?
[4:39:48] <+RaveBV> It might be. I know Lulu's VA was confirmed for someone in this game.
[4:39:52] <Sokumotanaka> @thefakeh FF10 waifu
[4:40:00] <examplez0> It's not the same
[4:40:04] <Sokumotanaka> @RaveBV FR?
[4:40:05] <examplez0> Lulu\s VA is Paula Tiso
[4:40:23] <arkv01> madam m voiced by an actual asian lady!
[4:40:37] <VeryTricky> Does this game have fishing
[4:40:41] <Sokumotanaka> Maybe they live in the same state? Area?
[4:40:42] <VeryTricky> pojLobster
[4:41:01] <+RaveBV> May have been a rumor though
[4:41:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's a regional dialect, from upstate new york
[4:41:08] <examplez0> Probably confirmed for some background character
[4:41:09] <TheWe4pon> Huh, Fuuka from P3 has the same VA as lulu
[4:41:19] <MilkingEdge> MARLENEEEEEE
[4:41:24] <+RaveBV> I remember reading about it somewhere
[4:41:31] <arkv01> @TheWe4pon hell yeah, I knew fuuka was a good girl
[4:41:48] <examplez0> You need one of the items from the moogle kid
[4:42:07] <BillieNoMates> NO
[4:42:10] <BillieNoMates> IT COMES
[4:42:10] <Xiichu> ahah
[4:42:14] <vonmaultke> FF7 Woolie
[4:42:14] <kingra> HIM
[4:42:15] <%Samex_Comex> Oh shit
[4:42:16] <@dcn2049> uh
[4:42:19] <arkv01> this bad boy can fit in SO MUCH KARMA
[4:42:19] <+Fatemaster> He's got a knife!
[4:42:22] <+RaveBV> HE'S JUST STANDING THERE
[4:42:24] <+RaveBV> MENACINGLY
[4:42:28] <+HawkGoggles2> It's mini shanks.
[4:42:35] <+whiskey_wolfe_> This freaking music
[4:42:39] <Sol_Install> nope
[4:42:40] <seth45er> DOINK!
[4:42:42] <Explodincatz> the 1 shot guys
[4:42:48] <arkv01> he wanna shank barret
[4:42:49] <BillieNoMates> Slowly walks towards Barret
[4:42:49] <Futurecity10> Oh god, I'm having FF15 endgame dungeons Flashbacks
[4:42:49] <Sol_Install> nope, ff15 taught me the hard way
[4:42:52] <BillieNoMates> Menancingly
[4:42:54] <TonberryLives> It's why I've taken that moniker LUL
[4:43:02] <MilkingEdge> STABBY STABBY
[4:43:08] <Futurecity10> Fucking nightmare tonberrys are mother fuckers
[4:43:13] <arkv01> stabbo!
[4:43:39] <Explodincatz> its karma
[4:43:39] <Frankomancer> Tonberrys are only beaten by Cactaurs for best FF enemy
[4:44:04] <BillieNoMates> ABORTION PUP COMMETH
[4:44:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah wouldve been nice to have someone with a low kill count
[4:44:18] <Sokumotanaka> The cutest thing in ff game are Chocobos, Tomberry, Moogles and Cautaur and all of them can murder everything else with ease
[4:44:31] <+XxBTExX> Rekt
[4:44:47] <arkv01> now he waddle!
[4:44:56] <Sol_Install> fucking rekt
[4:44:57] <TomFrank> i can wait for the remade frog enemies
[4:44:58] <Frankomancer> I wish I could remember which game had the bit where the villagers are tormented by cactuars just dancing on a cliffside
[4:45:02] <Explodincatz> nice
[4:45:02] <TomFrank> cant*
[4:45:08] <%CyberDingus> Pussies
[4:45:18] <MilkingEdge> STAB EM
[4:45:20] <cerazor01> Cloud
[4:45:26] <arkv01> thats a REWARD
[4:45:27] <cerazor01> Launguage
[4:45:30] <+whiskey_wolfe_> That was the flattest delivery of "bullshit"
[4:45:31] <%CyberDingus> Tifa you fool!!
[4:45:32] <examplez0> That's a flattening
[4:45:33] <TomFrank> tifas boot Kreygasm
[4:45:35] <Sol_Install> Tifa, we have to kill people sometimes
[4:45:36] <%CyberDingus> They are into it!!
[4:45:40] <MilkingEdge> THEY WILL LIKE THE BOOT TIFA
[4:45:41] <Sokumotanaka> KILL THEM
[4:45:45] <ahaegotrigger> she really shouldnt encourage them like that
[4:45:58] <Sol_Install> otherwise, no one will give a shit
[4:45:58] <Happy_Karl> So if you've never killed anyone in your life and ran into a Tonberry, would it be able to do much to you?
[4:46:05] <examplez0> There's an item you need from the moogle kid
[4:46:08] <Sol_Install> Also what if one of them wanted you to step on him? huh?
[4:46:39] <+RaveBV> The joke is that Tonberry can 1shot anything with the knife and it's the knife itself that's what's spooky
[4:46:46] <examplez0> The doctor gives you a list of the items you need
[4:46:55] <+RaveBV> so your skill prob wouldn't matter
[4:47:21] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:47:22] <+RaveBV> tonberry would prob be useless and waddle until it could stab you
[4:47:41] <cerazor01> FailFish
[4:47:47] <examplez0> Check your inventory
[4:47:56] <%caramello_man> check the map
[4:48:14] <examplez0> The list is literally in your inventory
[4:48:45] <Happy_Karl> Interesting. The only FF games I've really played and actually finished is 12 and 15, and I don't think it's in either.
[4:49:11] <Happy_Karl> So it's background is unknown to me.
[4:49:23] <RedAhoge> Did we get to the no way fg scene?
[4:50:25] <RedAhoge> I know its not on the screen, but does Plague have/use Pixiv?
[4:54:01] <examplez0> The doctor's list is in your inventory
[4:54:07] <examplez0> Check you inventory
[4:54:22] <examplez0> It will tell you what you need
[4:54:27] <Nimorp> the doctor's list is ridiculous
[4:55:13] <arkv01> docs trying to brew up elixirs to treat scraped knees
[4:55:29] <Sokumotanaka> Can't believe they made a guy with a gun fun to play
[4:55:37] <+Mugen4552> what sword is that ?
[4:55:48] <terminusterminal> Doc's list is in inventory somewhere I guess
[4:56:02] <examplez0> One of the items you need for the doctor you can get from the moogle kid
[4:56:14] <Sol_Install> he brought that
[4:56:20] <Sol_Install> that's not the list
[4:57:01] <examplez0> That's not the inventory
[4:57:06] <@dcn2049> that sounds like that sucks ass
[4:57:07] <examplez0> In the pause menu
[4:57:23] <Sol_Install> Yea
[4:57:38] <+Mugen4552> depends on how much mp attack you have as well as how long status effects can last
[4:57:51] <examplez0> The one where you played as Barret most of the time
[4:57:52] <terminusterminal> I expected Materia to glow in the weapon
[4:58:02] <Sol_Install> That's Sector 7 underground lab
[4:58:16] <examplez0> That's where the behemoth is
[4:58:27] <Sol_Install> yea
[4:58:28] <@dcn2049> ski-ball
[4:58:31] <examplez0> The one with the failed experiments
[4:58:37] <+Mugen4552> the chakra ability is good if they are staggered
[4:59:28] <@dcn2049> that sword looks like you stole it from a decepticon
[4:59:56] <examplez0> You can press L1 to bring up your health in the field
[5:00:45] <gunsrlove> Yeah MAN
[5:00:58] <Sol_Install> the fuck?
[5:01:03] <@dcn2049> Nice
[5:01:21] <Sol_Install> who he?
[5:01:24] <examplez0> It's the star saber
[5:01:25] <gunsrlove> WHo is this Tekken character
[5:01:31] <examplez0> Bruce
[5:01:35] <terminusterminal> Oh great is this the guy who doesn't stagger but stabs you with a knife that does stagger
[5:01:38] <Sokumotanaka> Bob
[5:01:41] <@dcn2049> what the hell
[5:02:00] <arkv01> his human master is pretty fragile
[5:02:05] <Huntercd> Like a discount Mike Epps
[5:02:11] <deltakyurem> assess
[5:02:22] <arkv01> hopefully this doesn't become an ornstein and smough scenario
[5:02:37] <Sol_Install> that's a hellhound?
[5:02:48] <Sol_Install> ah ok lab hellhound
[5:03:16] <terminusterminal> Just in time to drop blizzard
[5:03:39] <terminusterminal> Dropped for assess
[5:04:30] <Sol_Install> soinc the edgehog here
[5:07:21] <terminusterminal> Do we HAVE to talk to Chadley?
[5:07:42] <hcsarg1986> What was that strut of Barret's? Was he walking a runway?
[5:07:42] <deltakyurem> did you have trouble with the hell house
[5:08:08] <@dcn2049> Why is she there
[5:08:37] <Sol_Install> to be the yuffie for the part
[5:08:44] <+LordSDB> Padding, also for you to finally get that materia in the back
[5:09:06] <Sokumotanaka> She was dropped on her head as a baby
[5:09:09] <gunsrlove> But the old lady looks white
[5:09:09] <examplez0> She's such a poor substitute for Yuffie
[5:09:12] <+Fatemaster> Like an older sister.
[5:09:13] <%CyberDingus> damn
[5:09:17] <gunsrlove> and Kyrie looks anime Asian
[5:09:18] <Sol_Install> The best old lady
[5:09:27] <Monstergelo> face reveal?
[5:09:35] <Huntercd> Beat her ass gram gram
[5:09:40] <MilkingEdge> Girls gonna geta spanking from grandma
[5:09:42] <Sol_Install> Tifa, were you this dumb?
[5:09:47] <terminusterminal> Oh great, even thieves need principles now. What's the world coming to?
[5:09:53] <deltakyurem> it seems like the arena was too small, it was too aggressive, and it switched weaknesses to quickly
[5:10:03] <+StreamStopA> soo per man
[5:10:08] <%Samex_Comex> Thanks Iron Giant
[5:10:09] <examplez0> Wow who could have seen this coming
[5:10:17] <Sokumotanaka> To BE fair tifa is japanese she's probably thinking. "But you're so oooold"
[5:10:18] <terminusterminal> Fuck that. Keep it.
[5:10:43] <examplez0> Even though she was literally telling you everything you need to know about the Angel
[5:10:59] <strayawind> Whats up, Plague
[5:11:37] <examplez0> Don't forget to give Johnny his wallet
[5:11:44] <arkv01> nope, our wallet now
[5:11:51] <Sokumotanaka> ^
[5:11:52] <Sol_Install> fuck johnny
[5:12:04] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> one in the mechanic hand you used to lift aeris
[5:12:15] <Sokumotanaka> What johnny don't know wont hurt him
[5:12:23] <MilkingEdge> That what johnny get for simpin to a thot
[5:13:51] <terminusterminal> Is deadly dodge just a dodge attack or is it something else?
[5:13:58] <examplez0> Yes
[5:14:04] <MilkingEdge> bug was watching the stream
[5:14:05] <theloganbrand> The bug has been waiting decades for this game as well
[5:14:07] <Sokumotanaka> He wanna watch
[5:14:14] <examplez0> It was a whisper
[5:14:30] <examplez0> You're diverging from the canon Plague
[5:15:08] <@dcn2049> this kind of hurts to look at
[5:15:22] <examplez0> But the pretty lights tho
[5:15:43] <Sokumotanaka> I still see nothign wrong with it
[5:16:14] <suitangi021> Game needs a save/load equipment set function
[5:16:15] <@dcn2049> you have cursed eyes
[5:16:29] <Futurecity10> idk, bad sex is preeeeeeeeeeeetty bad
[5:16:37] <@dcn2049> Nah, you can have utterly bad of both and they're just wastes of time
[5:16:38] <MilkingEdge> large pizza extra sausage
[5:16:53] <@dcn2049> like taco pizza. Soggy mess
[5:17:32] <examplez0> What if you had bad sex with a bad pizza
[5:17:37] <examplez0> Do they cancel each other out
[5:17:41] <Sokumotanaka> Actually tifa they can't talk so they can't ask for it. They can't consent
[5:17:42] <@dcn2049> no
[5:17:53] <@dcn2049> they make a singularity of bad and destroy you
[5:17:57] <Sol_Install> bad * bad =/= good
[5:18:43] <gunsrlove> 40k Powerfist
[5:19:19] <suitangi021> What does speed do in this game?
[5:19:27] <examplez0> Makes you speedier
[5:19:50] <Explodincatz> yup
[5:19:57] <@dcn2049> but kids love space
[5:20:17] <Sokumotanaka> I think that's more of a personal preference than a flaw
[5:20:18] <suitangi021> @examplez0 Har har
[5:20:22] <examplez0> Real space is boring because it takes too long to go anywhere
[5:20:23] <arkv01> she's going to destroy some bloodlines
[5:20:43] <MilkingEdge> Space is spacious
[5:21:38] <+r_squared1672> did Plague beat the game?
[5:21:52] <Sokumotanaka> Idk why but tifa slowly falling from the sky was funny
[5:22:55] <Sokumotanaka> It's the fuzz, cheese it cloud!
[5:24:07] <terminusterminal> I think moogle kid has a new weapon, unless plague already has it. I dunno.
[5:24:33] <MilkingEdge> one in the sewer
[5:24:35] <oJxn> Chat, how do I get Materia links?
[5:25:09] <+CrimsonDio11> @PlagueOfGripes opinion on the ost?
[5:26:01] <MilkingEdge> nomura re-re-re-re-mix
[5:26:03] <gunsrlove> The NPC's having a different art style from the main cast bugs me. Realistic looking face scans for some, compared to anime detail face
[5:26:33] <examplez0> It's a key item
[5:26:39] <examplez0> You give it to Marle
[5:26:52] <examplez0> You can't equip it
[5:26:56] <Major_Morsel> So we all agree Cait Sithis the best character, right?
[5:27:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:27:22] <MilkingEdge> !uptime
[5:27:22] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 27 minutes 33 seconds
[5:27:37] <terminusterminal> If you use Refocus to get 3 atb bars and then use Maximum Fury then, what happens?
[5:27:55] <+CrimsonDio11> I do have to say about the ost I was surprised by how dubstep some of the songs are its strange
[5:28:17] <%bettysharkface> So what's even happening right now?
[5:28:48] <examplez0> He's going the long way instead of taking the chocobo carriage
[5:29:03] <%bettysharkface> That explained nothing, cheers.
[5:29:10] <arkv01> how much does chocobo carriage cost?
[5:29:16] <lbrownthedestroyer> has god forsaken u yet?
[5:29:17] <+CrimsonDio11> he is doing side quests
[5:29:26] <examplez0> They're free since he found the missing chcobos
[5:29:35] <examplez0> @bettysharkface You're quite welcome
[5:29:37] <arkv01> oh, huh
[5:29:47] <arkv01> we grinding I guess?
[5:30:09] <rubbishbinge> works great
[5:30:53] <Sokumotanaka> IS that a naruto reference? Kappa
[5:31:22] <+CrimsonDio11> so I noticed something that I dont think a lot of people have but your limit gauge resets every fight its kind of dumb
[5:31:29] <%bettysharkface> Why is it Barret singing when he's alone kinda fun, but the second he's back with the group you just kinda...clench
[5:31:48] <@dcn2049> It's the victory theme in particular that gets him
[5:32:06] <examplez0> If you have the first strike materia equipped you can enter battle with a slightly fuller ATB gauge
[5:32:11] <MilkingEdge> HELLYEAH
[5:32:12] <Sokumotanaka> @bettysharkface You may clench but the rest of us love it
[5:33:18] <cerazor01> no
[5:33:20] <rubbishbinge> Barret and Tifa are way better to play than Aerith and Cloud ;-;
[5:33:27] <cerazor01> no showering
[5:34:03] <examplez0> Aerith is as fun to play as in the remake as she is in the original
[5:34:08] <examplez0> Which is to say, not very
[5:35:04] <examplez0> Oh hey these guys again
[5:35:13] <+CrimsonDio11> I think you're supposed to play cloud more as a parry fiend than a swing your sword like a maniac
[5:35:38] <examplez0> And learn to alternate between operator and punisher
[5:35:58] <%bettysharkface> But wild flailing is fun.
[5:36:23] <Sol_Install> she's boring
[5:36:27] <+CrimsonDio11> I mean when you have the move you learn from the nail bat alternating between operator and punisher is great
[5:36:30] <Explodincatz> very
[5:36:31] <arkv01> if only she was a little freakier
[5:36:31] <Sokumotanaka> You right
[5:37:01] <rubbishbinge> the main issue with Cloud is that all his damage is at the end of his chains while Tifa can just use Overpower to skip right to her combo finishers
[5:37:08] <Urmay> is cait sith still a char?
[5:37:10] <suitangi021> I feel like there's less to Tifa as a person in this game than in the original
[5:37:34] <Sokumotanaka> @Urmay Oh you have NO idea it's a yup and he does appear
[5:37:42] <examplez0> Yeah I never bothered to level up Aeris's limit breaks
[5:37:48] <Major_Morsel> Chad Sith
[5:37:51] <examplez0> I might do that in my next playthrough of OG FF7
[5:37:58] <%bettysharkface> As the game has gone on, Tifa's personality has been overshadowed by more interesting types
[5:37:58] <cerazor01> 'i desire death' Mog
[5:38:27] <examplez0> In both OG FF7 and the remake she's just "Childhood Love Interest: The Character"
[5:38:45] <examplez0> You'd better rest first
[5:38:46] <mrgaster8> yes
[5:38:53] <+lojack69> Tifa always had the theme of "looks like a badass biker bitch but is actually a sweetheart"
[5:38:57] <suitangi021> I felt like she was a bit sassier in the original
[5:39:10] <+lojack69> the contradiction is supposed to be what's interesting, but it never got to me either
[5:39:11] <Sokumotanaka> It's sad how someone tired to tell me how deep she was a long time ago and I referenced the scene of her backflash where her own backflash turned into a backflash about cloud dick and not her character
[5:39:14] <arkv01> tifa is for making a soccer team with
[5:39:15] <gunsrlove> Hardedge looks so dumb
[5:39:21] <rubbishbinge> Tifa was made to visually appeal to westerners, but her personality is for the east
[5:39:31] <rubbishbinge> And Aerith is the reverse
[5:39:49] <Sol_Install> I like Aerith more
[5:39:52] <Major_Morsel> Interesting juxtaposition
[5:40:05] <Sol_Install> till yuffie comes up
[5:40:11] <Sol_Install> then yuffie is my fav
[5:40:24] <Rodzzila> as someone that never play the original, at what % mark of the game does the big spoiler happen? Is it even in this game?
[5:40:32] <+CrimsonDio11> there's a side quest you have to get first I think
[5:40:54] <KaiserMario> @PlagueOfGripes Hey Eli, how would you rank this amongst the other FFs so far? In your opinion, is this better than say... 12?
[5:40:54] <+lojack69> define "big spoiler"
[5:40:58] <cerazor01> undergrab
[5:41:17] <examplez0> You can hold L1 to instantly warp out at any time
[5:41:32] <Sol_Install> oh boy, back to the lab again.
[5:41:50] <Kampler21> Do you think we're gonna get more playable characters in this multipart remake outside of the intended 9 like Roche
[5:42:03] <examplez0> This is the quest for the behemoth
[5:42:18] <CursedNobleman> @Kampler21 original timeline sephiroth LUL
[5:42:20] <examplez0> We might get some Roche DLC
[5:42:35] <kiwicoffin> You're not allowed to start a quest til simon says
[5:42:51] <rubbishbinge> There was an NPC that blocked a gate I think
[5:42:52] <+CrimsonDio11> honestly call me crazy but I really enjoyed that behemoth fight @examplez0
[5:42:54] <cerazor01> I wonder if Roche will appear at Junon
[5:42:56] <$vampireinarm> you get leviathan for doing 15 requests for Chadley
[5:42:58] <restingbones> Ridley
[5:43:05] <Frankomancer> i dont know how they plan to make Cloud interesting to play for two more full games after this one
[5:43:10] <Magoloso> Hey Plague, thoughts on the game so far? Specially the changes
[5:43:11] <Kampler21> @CursedNobleman I can see them pulling that shit lol
[5:43:22] <restingbones> thank you, man with keys
[5:43:32] <CursedNobleman> @Kampler21 the best stupidity is semi-plausible
[5:43:35] <Thatdan> #1 guy
[5:43:36] <%bettysharkface> Barret hat
[5:43:46] <examplez0> @CrimsonDio11 It's like the behemoths from Kingdom Hearts
[5:43:52] <rubbishbinge> @Frankomancer Considering the ending to this game, there is a very real chance the next game will have a different main character
[5:43:52] <examplez0> Except much harder
[5:43:53] <restingbones> made a whole model. LOOK AT IT
[5:43:54] <BTRNDL> go see the fallout NPC
[5:43:56] <Magoloso> Are we in the truly dumb shit yet?
[5:44:02] <kiwicoffin> I guess they tacked it on after they designed the level
[5:44:06] <VeryTricky> Thank you man
[5:44:17] <restingbones> come on dude, its not that bad. you just had to go press x at a guy twice.
[5:44:26] <$vampireinarm> Do 15 requests for Chadley for Leviathan summon, 20 requests for Bahamut, Chapter 14 is the last chance to get them
[5:44:28] <gunsrlove> Nice fuckin model HONK HONK
[5:44:31] <CursedNobleman> you cant exclude zack or original timeline or alt timeline sephiroth
[5:44:35] <terminusterminal> 2 Chapters away from Judgement Day, if witness testimony is to be believed.
[5:44:48] <CursedNobleman> they probably cant even kill aerith LUL
[5:44:48] <+lojack69> Plague doesn't actually like rpgs at all
[5:44:50] <%Samex_Comex> He said the thing
[5:44:58] <Rodzzila> @lojack69 the one that probably 99% of people already know including me with Sephiroth and Aerith.
[5:45:29] <Kampler21> Nier automata has one of the best quest systems imo
[5:45:35] <cerazor01> Perhaps their QA told them to put that guy there because people kept getting lost somehow
[5:45:36] <Huntercd> Did they explain the ghosts yet?
[5:45:42] <Magoloso> Normal ghosts, completely different from Time Ghosts
[5:45:43] <cerazor01> because people are dumbasses
[5:45:49] <kiwicoffin> It's always Tifa's turn
[5:46:57] <+squidking96> honestly my issue with the game so far has been they just force you to stop every 10 seconds for "oooh cutscene must talk". like they keeping the pace at like a grandma on a highway
[5:47:02] <examplez0> Oh fuck not these guys again
[5:47:10] <arkv01> get hydrated
[5:47:19] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:47:22] <gunsrlove> go poop
[5:48:04] <examplez0> @squidking96 It's like somebody yanking the controller out of your hands and saying "HEY BRO CHECK THAT OUT HEY LOOK AT THAT"
[5:48:15] <+squidking96> yes
[5:48:20] <examplez0> Which wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't constantly do it over and over again
[5:48:28] <cerazor01> I like those thighs
[5:48:40] <+squidking96> but the combat and such feel great
[5:49:05] <cerazor01> I don't like when people in these games have to take so goddamn long to say cructial dialalogue when its important during cutscenes
[5:49:36] <kiwicoffin> It's very important you hear the gutteral noises and "huh?"
[5:49:43] <VeryTricky> Wash your hands
[5:49:52] <%bettysharkface> Banan
[5:50:01] <rubbishbinge> It feels god when you play it as a turn based RPG and ignore the action
[5:50:04] <rubbishbinge> good*
[5:50:08] <%bettysharkface> Good to see you eating something other than marshmallows
[5:50:10] <%Samex_Comex> Sweepy is back
[5:50:11] <+squidking96> like if that cut out a third of the cutscenes and didn't slow you down constantly I think it would vastly improve
[5:50:15] <+lojack69> shame that mode is locked to easy
[5:50:17] <KaiserMario> You are so sexy right now...
[5:50:26] <TheWe4pon> hey plague somebody said that chapter 14 is the last chance to get Leviathan and bahumat
[5:50:49] <mapimb> I feel like the game just choses to sabotage its combat for no reason
[5:51:02] <CursedNobleman> how do you mean, sabotage its combat?
[5:51:25] <Frankomancer> i'll never agree with the decision to change it from turn based to this shit
[5:51:26] <$vampireinarm> blade burt does crazy damage if you have high magical attack and do it point blank, it carried me through the last fight
[5:51:35] <gachipt2> So what’s the general consensus to this game chat?
[5:51:42] <+CrimsonDio11> lol once I got Barret's maximum furry I havent used any of his other abilities since
[5:51:43] <rubbishbinge> Tifa is pretty unique since her abilities actually interact with her normal attacks
[5:51:45] <TheWe4pon> bad game
[5:51:58] <+lojack69> Combat is fine, just everyone keeps treating it like it's dark souls thinking you can dodge everything
[5:51:59] <$vampireinarm> just finished it, already wanting to go in again
[5:52:10] <CursedNobleman> @gachipt2 depends on who you ask. generally people like it, though the ending is usually panned
[5:52:41] <ralanost> I just don't understand how they messed up this game so much. Is this the same situation that happened with George Lucas and the prequel trilogy and all his revisions to the original trilogy? People not telling the "star" creators their ideas are bad and need work?
[5:53:14] <+CrimsonDio11> @ralanost Im generally curious what is messed up?
[5:53:18] <gachipt2> Been seeing some people say the story is super fucked cause of nomura (which i don’t doubt)
[5:53:49] <+lojack69> Hard to talk about what makes the ending bad without just spoiling the shit out of it
[5:53:54] <+squidking96> I think I might go play original ff7, i think its better than the remake actually
[5:54:03] <+lojack69> you'll just have to get there and make up your own mind I suppose
[5:54:15] <CursedNobleman> @gachipt2 the character dialogue and OG references are welcomed, but the writers injected themes/story elements not present in the original which messes with things
[5:54:16] <arkv01> I dunno even if stuff is fucked this episode, still too early to judge without the next 3-4
[5:54:23] <ralanost> Yeah, story feels like the same extended nonsense that happened with Dirge of Cerberus and Crises Core. And who ever wanted all the useless side quests that add nothing to the narrative or the world?
[5:54:29] <CursedNobleman> BoF4 is better than FF7 LUL
[5:54:44] <rubbishbinge> I wouldn't say it's fucked up, just gotta accept that it's a whole different beast than FF7. I like the possibilities that the game can go towards after the ending
[5:54:55] <KaiserMario> @CursedNobleman I agree
[5:55:31] <KaiserMario> Does anyone know if Plague has played any of the BoF games?
[5:55:34] <CursedNobleman> BoF4 has better minigames, better combat system, and masters are superior to materia
[5:55:54] <CursedNobleman> and the themes and buddhist references tie in better
[5:56:06] <CursedNobleman> FF7 has better music though
[5:56:07] <KaiserMario> BoF3 is just as good too
[5:56:26] <TheWe4pon> what game is BoF
[5:56:34] <rubbishbinge> Breath of Fire
[5:56:36] <arkv01> dragon dildos
[5:56:36] <ralanost> All I know is that after what they did to VIIR, I don't want them touching VI.
[5:56:39] <TheWe4pon> ty
[5:56:41] <CursedNobleman> breath of fire, capcoms neglected RPG series
[5:57:12] <examplez0> I've only played BoF3
[5:57:13] <KaiserMario> I also hold Radiata Stories in high regard, and love it way more than FF7
[5:57:19] <arkv01> we must rescue the emperor of mankind
[5:57:41] <examplez0> It's decent but very slow paced
[5:57:43] <KaiserMario> @examplez0 Up to 4, they are all really good
[5:57:49] <CursedNobleman> i got tales of vesp since it was in the eshop at $20. im sure ill be disappointed its not Tales of Symponia LUL
[5:58:00] <examplez0> I'll give it a try some time
[5:58:06] <CursedNobleman> BoF1 is mediocre, 2-4 are pretty good
[5:58:09] <+lojack69> Vesperia is worlds better actually
[5:58:13] <+squidking96> I really enjoy BoF4
[5:58:15] <CursedNobleman> at least, i hear Bof1 is mediocre
[5:58:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> Finished this yesterday, I really liked it!
[5:58:38] <Frankomancer> Thinking about RPGs makes me really wish Front Mission 3 was available on any modern platform
[5:58:40] <KaiserMario> @CursedNobleman It's good for being old and also the first one
[5:58:53] <CursedNobleman> BoF2 is pretty cool by virtue of getting past nintendos SNES removal of religious themes LUL
[5:59:22] <rubbishbinge> Vesperia is awesome on NG+, but the first time through can be rough. Once you get al the skills it's the best Tales of IMO
[5:59:25] <+squidking96> @frankomancer its not modern but its in ps3
[5:59:30] <$vampireinarm> heal up
[5:59:45] <Medo3G> man the focus testers got really lost here
[5:59:46] <examplez0> You'd better heal first
[5:59:50] <CursedNobleman> @rubbishbinge hopefully. i just need it to tide me over until the XCOM2 and Catherine ports
[5:59:58] <Iradium228> I think what was making the noise was you were clipping through a metal barricade.
[5:59:59] <CursedNobleman> or employment. whichever comes first LUL
[6:00:10] <terminusterminal> First strike is big stuff
[6:00:16] <rubbishbinge> First Strike materia
[6:00:22] <SuperVaderMan> Barret immediately eating shit LUL
[6:00:23] <$vampireinarm> LUL
[6:00:29] <MilkingEdge> Barret skydiving
[6:00:32] <Frankomancer> @squidking96 honestly that and a few other ps3 exclusives make me tempted to buy one. I was playing Front Mission 3 on Vita but lost it years ago
[6:00:49] <CursedNobleman> i admit, watching this makes me want to play FFT
[6:00:54] <rubbishbinge> Parry materia does big work for this one
[6:01:00] <$vampireinarm> dont use magic until you break its horn
[6:01:10] <+lojack69> FFT was too good to be called final fantasy
[6:01:30] <CursedNobleman> its just a Song of Ice and Fire/War of Roses ripoff
[6:01:33] <KaiserMario> @rubbishbinge I have a soft spot for Tales of the Abyss, I always appreciate how the MC changes
[6:01:39] <+squidking96> @frankomancer the ps3 also has I think every smt ps2 game and some of the ps1 games
[6:02:23] <cyberblueneon> i wonder if this game will create a precedent for more games getting cut into parts and getting sold as full games
[6:02:34] <+aspirationdeath> why wouldnt you just play those on an emulator?
[6:02:45] <terminusterminal> Seems like assess is just necessary for every boss fight
[6:02:57] <+aspirationdeath> looks and runs so much better
[6:02:58] <CursedNobleman> @cyberblueneon they should do it to OG ogre battle and instead of jessie we can be propositioned by the old witches LUL
[6:03:40] <$vampireinarm> enemies naturally aggro on the controlled character
[6:04:06] <Frankomancer> i guess i could just emulate it. I havent had my own PC very long so I never looked into emulating old games on one
[6:04:26] <KaiserMario> I would really love for Plague to play Radiata Stories though, the themes of nepotism, going from government work into the private sector, and racial prejudice are really well done in that game...
[6:04:38] <+ConLin_Arts_> this was a fun fight
[6:04:42] <examplez0> Nah he should play Lost Odyssey instead
[6:04:49] <examplez0> Now THAT is a true underrated gem
[6:05:08] <examplez0> Easily the best JRPG of the 7th gen
[6:05:09] <KaiserMario> Is it underrated?
[6:05:11] <+ConLin_Arts_> I got Vagrant Story on PS1 a little while ago
[6:05:17] <examplez0> Sales wise it is
[6:05:17] <rubbishbinge> Lost Odysey playthrough with Woolie WHEN
[6:05:30] <+aspirationdeath> @frankomancer its easy as piss. i have a ps3 emu that i play demon souls and ps2 rpgs on
[6:05:31] <+lojack69> Lost Odyssey was a huge flop for me when I played it
[6:05:36] <+ConLin_Arts_> is Lost Odyssey on Gamepass or BC?
[6:05:37] <mapimb> i could see him possibly enjoying trails in the sky
[6:05:38] <KaiserMario> undersold then
[6:05:42] <+lojack69> but I honestly can't say anything too harsh about it
[6:06:00] <$vampireinarm> hes gonna kill his own team if he keeps casting magic lol
[6:06:13] <+lojack69> Just was not to my tastes
[6:06:29] <lobozo> Where did PlagueOfGripes get a Super Model to fake his webcam?
[6:06:32] <+ConLin_Arts_> not every game is for everybody
[6:06:38] <CursedNobleman> i dont think most people can play trails in the sky
[6:06:39] <examplez0> @lojack69 Fair enough
[6:06:46] <KaiserMario> @ConLin_Arts_ Vagrant Story is great, but very weird, have touched it yet?
[6:06:49] <CursedNobleman> trails is way too high investment
[6:06:53] <examplez0> @CursedNobleman Isn't it on steam?
[6:06:54] <Hydrapissed> The poison worked
[6:06:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> tried it a little bit
[6:07:02] <arkv01> pat's already showing signs he can't do trails
[6:07:08] <mapimb> its a slow burn for sure
[6:07:22] <+ConLin_Arts_> only the beginning, really want to try it out more but I have so much else to play
[6:07:30] <CursedNobleman> like, i saw trails has a gametime of 100+ or whatever, that aint happening for me
[6:07:42] <examplez0> Yeah if you have a short attention span you're not gonna have a good time with Trails
[6:07:44] <KaiserMario> @ConLin_Arts_ I'd suggest you read little bit how the weapon system works
[6:07:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> ye!
[6:08:03] <+aspirationdeath> isnt trails a bit bloated on the superfluous dialogue department? the incessant waffling of japanese games is the most grating shit
[6:08:06] <lobozo> is this a new monster hunter update?
[6:08:20] <+ConLin_Arts_> Also stoked on Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition
[6:08:22] <$vampireinarm> you are immune to interrupts when you limit break if you stay on the character and let the animation play out
[6:08:24] <rubbishbinge> Horn is immune until you stagger lol
[6:08:49] <CursedNobleman> i cant do 100+ hour videogames anymore. it gets too samey
[6:08:54] <Hydrapissed> behe 101 there lol
[6:08:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> yep
[6:09:04] <+ConLin_Arts_> it was a desperation move
[6:10:03] <+lojack69> I still gotta play Xenoblade chronicles 2, bought it and its season pass, has just sat on the shelf unopened ever since
[6:10:47] <Explodincatz> if enemies attacked the AI they would die twice as fast
[6:11:11] <examplez0> I still haven't played FF15 yet
[6:11:12] <$vampireinarm> dont forget to talk to the guy that told you about the behemot for that reward
[6:11:17] <examplez0> Still have the unused DLC code
[6:11:34] <+lojack69> I do, it doesn't expire
[6:11:37] <Maids4lyfe> 15 is just awful
[6:11:38] <Explodincatz> i meant the AI party members would die twice as fast
[6:11:48] <examplez0> It expires like 10 years after the game's release
[6:11:55] <tokenreefer> the ending of ff15 ruins the game
[6:11:57] <gachipt2> Plague is playing on a ps4 pro right?
[6:12:01] <+bear_breaker20> expensive medicine
[6:12:02] <+LordSDB> That and doing magic usually hurts everyone, like everyone on the field
[6:12:03] <examplez0> So just like the remake
[6:12:03] <%CyberDingus> Viagra?
[6:12:07] <theloganbrand> Aphrodisiac
[6:12:16] <MilkingEdge> Erectile dsyfunction
[6:12:16] <arkv01> viagra for the orphans?
[6:12:16] <Maids4lyfe> horny goat weed
[6:12:19] <rubbishbinge> This game is a turn based rpg that tried to become an arpg but just stopped half way
[6:12:20] <%Samex_Comex> Finally Tums
[6:12:38] <+LordSDB> Like trying to use ice magic to freeze a boss on a lake but having no way to tell them to get away sucks
[6:12:38] <examplez0> You still have Johnny's wallet lol
[6:12:54] <$vampireinarm> you gotta talk to the guy again for the reward
[6:13:00] <+bear_breaker20> you beat the game already plague ?
[6:13:10] <Huntercd> Wet market to make meds
[6:13:14] <mapimb> isnt there a classic mode in this game
[6:13:30] <MilkingEdge> fuck johnny
[6:13:32] <GiygasDrillBreak> Nomura is that one JRPG designer who listened to complaints of "it should be real-time instead of turn-based"
[6:13:37] <MilkingEdge> keep his wallet
[6:13:40] <examplez0> He's at the station
[6:13:42] <$vampireinarm> and you cant complete the one about corneos stash until you go into the sewers with Leslie
[6:14:14] <$vampireinarm> you need to advance the story to get to it, you havent seen the sewer stash yet @PlagueOfGripes
[6:14:29] <rubbishbinge> Did Plague get the Lv 2 limits from the colosseum?
[6:14:30] <Huntercd> I don't like the battle system here it's a sad middleground that isn't great
[6:15:06] <examplez0> Or just take the chocobo carriage
[6:15:35] <arkv01> fist that hedgepie ass
[6:15:40] <arkv01> turn it into a meatpie
[6:15:45] <MilkingEdge> creampie
[6:15:59] <%bettysharkface> NotLikeThis
[6:16:52] <theloganbrand> I'm more of a bat tit kinda guy
[6:16:53] <+lojack69> You must froth it first on your chest
[6:16:54] <ahaegotrigger> you cant stop me Plague
[6:16:59] <arkv01> those hedgepie models will be SFM'd
[6:17:14] <MilkingEdge> BRO

[6:18:21] <CursedNobleman> hey-hey lets go kinka suru!
[6:18:33] <$vampireinarm> you gotta talk to the guy who told you to fight the behemoth to clear it
[6:18:37] <KaiserMario> LUL What if he calls him "Onee-chan"
[6:18:45] <arkv01> we're definitely seeing johnny again at the gold saucer
[6:18:45] <CursedNobleman> ara ara
[6:19:09] <rubbishbinge> Ya didn't talk to him after behemoth
[6:19:21] <$vampireinarm> i hope jhonny is living the life at the gold saucer when we see him again
[6:19:36] <Explodincatz> man this game is long
[6:19:41] <rubbishbinge> Nah, it's specifically behemoth
[6:19:58] <%bettysharkface> You say behemoth in a way I am not familiar with, is that how it's actually said, or is that an accent thing?
[6:20:11] <CursedNobleman> no, thats what id expect from anyone that claims to want a new start LUL
[6:20:13] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's eli saying it the eli way
[6:20:55] <theloganbrand> You see him later in a different town in OG
[6:20:59] <Frankomancer> You'll find Johnny's corpse at Cosmo Canyon with no explanation
[6:21:33] <rubbishbinge> This is a good one
[6:22:29] <MilkingEdge> CAME IN LIKE A WRECKING BALL
[6:23:43] <+bear_breaker20> treat your party like pokemon covering elemental weaknesses
[6:24:37] <Medo3G> did it just say that tifa already has assess?
[6:24:58] <%Demirose41> love u plague <3
[6:25:10] <examplez0> You need the last tiara too
[6:25:16] <%Demirose41> they are a side quest
[6:25:24] <examplez0> You need all three
[6:25:26] <rubbishbinge> You need to give the full set
[6:26:03] <TheWe4pon> plague you gonna try to get the rest of the chadly summons?
[6:26:43] <rubbishbinge> @PlagueOfGripes did you get the Lv.2 Limits and SP books in the colosseum?
[6:27:00] <MilkingEdge> Chadmeister
[6:27:10] <%Demirose41> its still open
[6:27:11] <examplez0> The Virgin Chadley
[6:27:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:28:47] <TheWe4pon> these descriptions really suck
[6:29:28] <MilkingEdge> !uptime
[6:29:28] <@Nightbot> 6 hours 29 minutes 40 seconds
[6:29:31] <rubbishbinge> Increase ATB to 3
[6:30:16] <rubbishbinge> Yep
[6:30:28] <countcarrion> Are the right Materia actually showing up in the sword slots there?
[6:30:43] <examplez0> Nobody seems to mind the Wutai aesthetic Corneo has going on
[6:31:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's almost like Corneo was a Wutai man all along
[6:31:12] <countcarrion> If they are that's a great detail. Square outdid themselves.
[6:31:41] <%Demirose41> The vol. just give u 10 weapon points and not story specific
[6:31:41] <arkv01> cloud versus goose
[6:31:42] <rubbishbinge> Moogle amulet increases drop rate
[6:32:00] <examplez0> Cloud versus Super Best Friends
[6:32:01] <rubbishbinge> Tarot just increases debuff time on enemies I think
[6:32:04] <mapimb> cloud versus the world
[6:32:23] <arkv01> the OG animations are verrry sexy
[6:32:23] <CursedNobleman> the world ends with cloud
[6:33:33] <examplez0> His sword twirling isn't as cool here
[6:33:49] <countcarrion> The true metric, the singular marker for whether the remake is good will come much later though.
[6:33:51] <+lojack69> looked better in smash
[6:34:02] <countcarrion> It's garbage tier if you don't get to awkwardly ride with Barret at the Golden Saucer.
[6:34:18] <examplez0> Looked better in Kingdom Hearts
[6:34:21] <examplez0> When Sora did it
[6:34:59] <mapimb> did someone order MORE AIR COMBAT
[6:36:24] <countcarrion> Does the Hyper item still exist? In the original you could use that for more frequent limit breaks, at the cost of taking more damage.
[6:36:55] <rubbishbinge> because young kids misread it as cumhazard
[6:37:17] <examplez0> This just looks goofy
[6:37:17] <@dcn2049> haha nice
[6:37:28] <@dcn2049> overkill
[6:38:05] <countcarrion> This is how Barret canonically dies
[6:38:41] <rubbishbinge> yep, melee barret is a probm
[6:38:42] <@dcn2049> why.
[6:38:42] <examplez0> Are you having fun yet Plague?
[6:39:12] <examplez0> This is almost as bad as when you're gangbanged by Touch Mes in the original game
[6:39:17] <countcarrion> Considering how far they went with the combat system I'm surprised they didn't let you cancel out of certain moves.
[6:39:34] <rubbishbinge> You heal 50% each round its fine
[6:39:50] <+ArmoredTeeth> Shame they don't let you swap weapons on the fly. Imagine the sick combos.
[6:41:01] <@dcn2049> I love how brutal he is
[6:41:09] <examplez0> "Ha, I'm sure to win because my speed is superior!"
[6:41:13] <+lojack69> Tanks can do big number too
[6:41:19] <rubbishbinge> Barret is absolutely the MVP in this game
[6:41:25] <kuzokai> I would think this more of a juggernaut
[6:41:27] <MilkingEdge> Tank big black man
[6:41:35] <countcarrion> To be fair I never really see tanks designed as the Unstoppable Force, they're just the Immovable Object.
[6:41:40] <@dcn2049> MMO's have stupid ideas though
[6:41:53] <countcarrion> Because as we know, tanks in real life are immobile.
[6:42:23] <examplez0> To be fair in a game where you're interrupted if the enemy so much as breathes on you then it's a bad thing
[6:42:30] <+ArmoredTeeth> I was planning on playing with Japanese VA but English Barrett is just too fun to hear.
[6:42:43] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[6:42:46] <rubbishbinge> Just spam Maximum Fury
[6:42:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> a true man
[6:42:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> japanese these days are allergic to POISE
[6:42:58] <@dcn2049> Do max fury!
[6:43:17] <+ArmoredTeeth> The gatling gun was just training weights
[6:43:17] <CursedNobleman> nice
[6:43:22] <@dcn2049> hahahaa
[6:43:26] <+ConLin_Arts_> You DON'T kick birds out of the sky Plague?
[6:43:27] <countcarrion> That's what the audience pays for!
[6:43:28] <terminusterminal> The gun arm was holding him back
[6:43:34] <terminusterminal> What a man
[6:43:38] <TheWe4pon> God Barret is just the best
[6:43:45] <@dcn2049> "Barret vs wild animals" is entertaining
[6:44:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> I loved all of the characters in this game, they where so good!
[6:44:28] <rubbishbinge> She's the best melee easily
[6:44:31] <@dcn2049> kill the sleeper
[6:45:03] <@dcn2049> unless you get grabbed anyhow
[6:45:24] <countcarrion> Is FF XV anything like this? I'm retroactively interested.
[6:45:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> Starshower is such a good move, and Omnistrike
[6:45:28] <rubbishbinge> Focused Strike has a jank hit box but it refunds ATB if you land it, so you can wombo combo
[6:45:31] <+Scorze> literally biting chunks out of her for `13 damage
[6:45:33] <+Scorze> what a dog
[6:45:37] <countcarrion> I know it had some sort of real time combat system.
[6:46:01] <+ConLin_Arts_> it is more like a slower KH if I understand it correctly?
[6:46:04] <cerazor01> I wonder if Barrets stump arm itches
[6:46:18] <+ArmoredTeeth> Tifa for Evo
[6:46:21] <@dcn2049> Tifa looks a lot of fun
[6:46:30] <@dcn2049> just kick it
[6:47:19] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[6:47:21] <cerazor01> SHORYUKEN
[6:47:41] <+ArmoredTeeth> it's scared
[6:48:13] <rubbishbinge> They were made for Barret and Aerith, to encourage you to swap characters
[6:48:21] <rubbishbinge> in other words, the worst
[6:48:56] <+bear_breaker20> they could be better they just have no impact
[6:49:08] <+ArmoredTeeth> LUL
[6:49:10] <countcarrion> Crushed that man's spine into atoms.
[6:49:23] <TheWe4pon> that man is dead now
[6:49:29] <+ArmoredTeeth> You see, Barrett never really killed anyone
[6:49:47] <%caramello_man> they hate that guy
[6:49:57] <ahaegotrigger> wow Barret just like Kiryu has NEVER killed anyone
[6:49:59] <rubbishbinge> RACE TRAITOR
[6:50:06] <+lethallunacyx> It's one guy
[6:50:34] <+ArmoredTeeth> The reactor explosion had 0 casualties. Barrett made sure of that.
[6:50:41] <terminusterminal> What does the Barrett's triangle look like now
[6:51:45] <cerazor01> hit my shield
[6:51:52] <cerazor01> cmon do it you naughty boy
[6:53:16] <+LordSDB> The ragdolling is kinda funny when he kicks them
[6:53:49] <cerazor01> I dont like it when Barret Naruto runs
[6:54:18] <rubbishbinge> Charging Uppercut is pretty much there to speed up the cooldown on his triangle attack
[6:54:45] <+lojack69> and added Tankceratops
[6:55:02] <cerazor01> 'Taste Tifa's boot' challenge.
[6:56:18] <crusader_heide> he needs a dmc5 pasta arm
[6:56:27] <rubbishbinge> Big Bertha is his best physical gun arm I think
[6:56:54] <+ArmoredTeeth> Summons are more frequent than limit breaks yeah
[6:57:26] <rubbishbinge> Next gun is magic and critical based, dunno if there's any after that
[6:57:35] <+LordSDB> And they seem only good for getting some free invincible frames
[6:57:37] <crusader_heide> No? ooOOOOOooo
[6:57:43] <TheWe4pon> it turns into atp up or something
[6:58:09] <examplez0> Yes
[6:58:14] <examplez0> Seriously
[6:58:20] <cerazor01> It will be the Bosses Cousin
[6:58:22] <theloganbrand> If you max the pedometer you can stare at an hd model of every character's feet
[6:58:30] <NineBall3D> 50 levelcap
[6:58:30] <rubbishbinge> 50
[6:58:32] <+ArmoredTeeth> Level 50 according to the trophy list
[6:58:41] <rubbishbinge> Menu shows 250 as SP cap
[6:58:57] <Frankomancer> even being able to get to 50 is weird. Theres still so much of game left
[6:59:28] <cerazor01> 'now take your pants off' Barret
[6:59:52] <examplez0> Not yet
[7:01:07] <rubbishbinge> sahagins are the worst
[7:01:43] <TheWe4pon> no stagger from Barret at all wtf
[7:01:52] <cerazor01> Do Sahagins dance?
[7:02:27] <rubbishbinge> They only stagger from ice and fire magic
[7:03:27] <cerazor01> Apparently Leslie is some sort of book character that came out with ff7
[7:03:59] <rubbishbinge> magic takes them out fast
[7:04:13] <rubbishbinge> so tifas chi trap or cloud's blade beam
[7:04:49] <+ArmoredTeeth> Sewer levels are always obnoxious
[7:05:09] <+lojack69> Bet Aerith would be funner as a melee character too
[7:05:24] <+lojack69> She technically was in the OG really
[7:06:14] <+ArtOlivero> PLAGUE STREAMS?!?!?!
[7:07:05] <Medo3G> what an amazing encounter
[7:07:12] <+ArtOlivero> lol
[7:09:07] <examplez0> There's another one further down
[7:09:11] <examplez0> Way further down
[7:09:17] <shunbamay> so this is what you look like mr gripes
[7:09:45] <+crown_clown22> what do you think of the game so far?
[7:09:50] <MilkingEdge> goop
[7:10:10] <oshkeet41> or at least make the enemies real colorful if its gonna be otherwise dark
[7:11:01] <%bettysharkface> Who's talking
[7:11:05] <deltakyurem> @plagueofgripes i have been streaming but dont get viewers. even if i do they leave quickly. do you have any advice
[7:11:53] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes I watch for the grumble, and for the voices
[7:11:59] <gnollAUS> Here for that silky smooth voice
[7:12:07] <MilkingEdge> We like watching plagues suffering
[7:12:08] <shunbamay> I'm waiting for you to snap and go off on the game
[7:12:18] <arkv01> plague honeydicking us with his voice
[7:12:36] <%CyberDingus> that's lewd
[7:12:37] <examplez0> I love watching you rant about the remake because I agree with everything you've said about it so far
[7:12:44] <+TheOeren> I come here to find out why you post the things you post on your twitter
[7:13:56] <oshkeet41> Gotta admit, i was scared with Roche but otherwise than him so far none of the new characters have been too offensive (or are just irelevant enough it dont matter)
[7:14:03] <TheWe4pon> love how the AI just stand in the acid and melt
[7:14:11] <JGRoos> man he streams at the strangest times, it's midday where i am so i guess it's early morning there?
[7:14:12] <rubbishbinge> You can one shot them with any magic attack including atb ones like blade beam
[7:14:28] <TheWe4pon> 4:30 am here
[7:14:44] <+lojack69> Roche is the best new character they made
[7:14:47] <%bettysharkface> Not even Plague knows when he's gonna stream
[7:14:49] <examplez0> Roche is nowhere near as bad as Genesis
[7:15:11] <examplez0> Or Angeal
[7:15:36] <examplez0> But especially Genesis
[7:15:55] <TheWe4pon> I have no idea who those characters are
[7:16:00] <examplez0> Good
[7:16:03] <terminusterminal> They all suck
[7:16:05] <examplez0> You don't want to know them
[7:16:18] <terminusterminal> No need to burden the mind remembering them more than that
[7:16:30] <+lojack69> Roche is just Dante with a mullet
[7:16:32] <Medo3G> no shuttup
[7:16:35] <Medo3G> it's fine
[7:16:46] <hcsarg1986> Surely not all compilation characters are bad?
[7:16:46] <+lojack69> That's not too bad in my eyes
[7:16:59] <JGRoos> so i heard this game is broken up into episodes, anyone know how many they gonna release?
[7:17:02] <examplez0> No they all are
[7:17:06] <examplez0> Every single one
[7:17:06] <oshkeet41> Its more a balance between how solid a minor character's concept is vs how much screentime they get
[7:17:12] <examplez0> Even the returning characters are ruined
[7:17:26] <examplez0> Oh boy sidequest time
[7:17:29] <oshkeet41> gimmick characters being used too *long* is usually the issue
[7:17:30] <examplez0> In the sewers
[7:17:33] <examplez0> Yay
[7:17:43] <Kejang> oh for fucks sake
[7:17:44] <+Shady_Zaku> oh god damn it
[7:17:50] <Medo3G> this is dumb
[7:17:50] <arkv01> yoooo this track
[7:17:51] <TheWe4pon> can you say PADDING
[7:17:53] <MilkingEdge> That's my testicle
[7:19:07] <hcsarg1986> @examplez0 Even Angeal
[7:19:52] <examplez0> Yep
[7:20:06] <examplez0> He's just a walking plot device for Zack to inherit the buster sword from
[7:20:22] <examplez0> And the way he never shuts up about muh dreams and honor pisses me off
[7:20:25] <smugfox95> The testicle thief should be long gone by now
[7:20:51] <Shinko200> Dumbapples LUL
[7:21:04] <hcsarg1986> @examplez0 Okay :(
[7:21:07] <TheWe4pon> why are these enemies so bad. why did they make them this way?
[7:21:39] <+crown_clown22> they arent that hard
[7:21:52] <Djinnazz> they just have armor
[7:22:13] <hcsarg1986> This game has a lot of padding
[7:22:37] <smugfox95> it IS a puppy
[7:22:47] <arkv01> yeah they fixed the translation
[7:22:55] <TheWe4pon> that thing breed? with what?
[7:23:00] <TheWe4pon> women?
[7:23:01] <+crown_clown22> fixed translation more like
[7:23:03] <MilkingEdge> Don Corneo's offspring
[7:23:29] <Huntercd> abortions?
[7:23:30] <%CyberDingus> Surely there must be a dozen of doujins
[7:23:32] <%CyberDingus> DOZENS
[7:23:36] <%CyberDingus> on this exact topic
[7:23:45] <arkv01> I mean, aps is probably going to be used in SFMs now
[7:23:49] <examplez0> It's asexual
[7:23:52] <+LordSDB> It's probably asexually reproduced
[7:24:02] <examplez0> As you'll find out in a boss fight with it soon
[7:24:32] <MilkingEdge> Don getting busy with monsters
[7:25:19] <+icarus_earth> sahagin are the worst
[7:27:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[7:27:19] <+crown_clown22> i love fighting Sahagins, they give me challenge
[7:27:46] <GeltonZ> What monster used to be a girl before being experimented on?
[7:27:46] <examplez0> The friendly AI is pretty bad
[7:31:16] <cerazor01> You are the monster that used to be a girl.
[7:31:21] <Frankomancer> oh my god this section is STILL GOING
[7:31:44] <terminusterminal> Why doesn't Barrett, the biggest one, simply eat the enemy?
[7:31:44] <Tommyrats> Wow these expanded areas of Midgar are so amazing
[7:31:45] <smugfox95> Nice door
[7:31:50] <kiwicoffin> still flooded
[7:32:19] <ComfyFox> i cant swim raiden
[7:32:26] <Frankomancer> the developers had some massive balls to make this go on so long, this padding is ridiculous
[7:33:16] <hcsarg1986> @Frankomancer Then let's rip them off just like Aerith
[7:33:26] <Chester_goes_Berserk> what's happening atm? are they on the way to shinra hq?
[7:33:28] <+Baresenio> "padding" XD
[7:33:35] <BTRNDL> @Frankomancer an't you see how IN DEPTH this sewer mission is? I really wanted to see more of the sewers elaK
[7:34:34] <Medo3G> use the summon on him
[7:34:36] <Medo3G> nuke em
[7:35:01] <rubbishbinge> they pick up stools and stuff
[7:35:04] <+crown_clown22> i didnt mind this section
[7:35:25] <rubbishbinge> Barret's gun solves these guys
[7:35:49] <Kejang> boohoo not my pendant
[7:35:53] <terminusterminal> Is this entire padding sequence done for Leslie's character? Isn't Aerith in trouble?
[7:36:07] <Kejang> YOU FEEL SAD NOW
[7:36:18] <+lojack69> He had a better design then
[7:36:24] <arkv01> corneo perv-kun has a family now
[7:36:25] <kiwicoffin> Now we know he got cucked. Much better
[7:36:27] <+HawkGoggles2> I got cucked and that's my sad backstory.
[7:36:37] <GeltonZ> She got nice booty shorts though
[7:36:38] <arkv01> ewww
[7:36:44] <arkv01> actual cuck
[7:36:46] <smugfox95> shes probably the thing you just killed
[7:36:46] <Chester_goes_Berserk> that was big generic model
[7:36:47] <TheWe4pon> what is even the point of this character?
[7:36:52] <cerazor01> Stab
[7:36:53] <Medo3G> I ain't saying she's a gold digger
[7:36:55] <cerazor01> Him
[7:37:04] <MilkingEdge> PJSalt
[7:37:18] <cyberblueneon> man, i always wanted to know what this guys backstory was, hes such an iconic character but we never knew enough about him in the original
[7:37:26] <examplez0> She got addicted to fat ugly bastards
[7:37:38] <rubbishbinge> Leslie's ok
[7:37:43] <%CyberDingus> big Barret is such a softie
[7:37:59] <hcsarg1986> @cyberblueneon The Star Wars method
[7:38:01] <joanna9700> Barret cool
[7:38:13] <Phoenixianstyle> I would have liked it better if that monster was presumed to be the girl and that's why it stole the pendant... but not the case so idc

[7:52:50] <joanna9700> Holy crap Barret becomes a tank
[7:53:04] <kiwicoffin> I think the dirty secret of this game is that the enemy ai has a hardon for whoever the player is controlling
[7:53:07] <TheWe4pon> looks like limit resets per fight
[7:53:27] <kuzokai> lovely how they have all the tracking in the world but you get fuck all
[7:54:04] <TheTakkster> I'm still pretty sure this game's combat system is way worse than it looks
[7:54:23] <terminusterminal> Does limit reset per cutscene?
[7:54:29] <HandoGod> Keep in mind this took inspiration from Kingdom Hearts.
[7:54:31] <terminusterminal> Or was it always that low?
[7:55:35] <Medo3G> royal rat authority :p
[7:55:43] <TheTakkster> If the adds do something interesting themselves, it can be interesting

[8:05:10] <Phoenixianstyle> ever heard of attack on Titan, they stole the idea from us
[8:05:11] <olaksi> Why does this character seem important? He's not important
[8:05:19] <TheTakkster> It's ok. Parts 2 and 3 will me massively truncated to make up for part 1 being super padded
[8:05:20] <MilkingEdge> cucklie
[8:05:30] <%CyberDingus> @PlagueOfGripes Explore
[8:05:36] <%CyberDingus> aww

[8:05:56] <rubbishbinge> You're at a quick travel place
[8:05:58] <arkv01> part 2 is gonna be kalm, swamp, cave, train tracks, corel, gold saucer?
[8:06:08] <examplez0> "We're supposed to be looking for Aerith but we decided to fuck around the slums for a bit first"
[8:06:24] <TheTakkster> Part 2 needs to get at least as far as the ancient ruins
[8:06:31] <Medo3G> embezzlement
[8:06:45] <olaksi> Wait Sector 7 fell already? Why isn't she dead?
[8:06:46] <Aeonleon> I love the time ghost creations
[8:06:48] <arkv01> yeah end it at ancient ruins probably, with cait sith getting crushed and big sadness
[8:06:54] <+lojack69> All these people not dying sudden and violent deaths is when I lost hope in this remake
[8:06:54] <rubbishbinge> You'll also get another Elemental mateia
[8:07:01] <Tommyrats> You did it for that great expansion of Leslie as a character being a cuck
[8:07:06] <TheTakkster> Er...i meant the ancient city
[8:07:09] <+lojack69> it was such a perfect tone setter
[8:07:15] <xeros720> the real rewatd is given to you on the way to the exit to the next chapter
[8:07:16] <TheTakkster> Wherever Aerith gets rekt
[8:07:39] <rubbishbinge> you get it at the point of no return after completing all side quests
[8:07:50] <xeros720> yeah, that one
[8:08:17] <rubbishbinge> It's railroading from here on out
[8:08:18] <+azure22900> At least two.
[8:08:28] <kiwicoffin> There is no event they can't pad out
