[0:01:22] <%Scarnehu> ban-zetsubo
[0:01:50] <%lemoan> wow I'm early for once
[0:02:04] <laserbeaming> Kill Grandpa
[0:02:47] <%Scarnehu> it's great to see you streaming more Plague. as much as I love your animations, they really suck the life out of you
[0:03:16] <%ralphwiggum16> Why doesn't Plague love us like we love him?
[0:04:01] <%Scarnehu> because he knows he's better than us
[0:04:38] <whittacre> 0h h1
[0:04:43] <%boatzndhoez> Praying to uninstall , what does he mean O_O
[0:04:56] <%ralphwiggum16> He hopes the game will uninstall itself.
[0:05:07] <%boatzndhoez> LUL sounds about right
[0:05:31] <%ralphwiggum16> Tell us a story, Plague!
[0:05:59] <brexdq> I learned and watched the Ankha Zone video am I going to hell
[0:06:17] <DJDontPanic> plague wants the beef
[0:06:17] <%boatzndhoez> pvpNOD
[0:06:18] <whittacre> that's a long drive just for low quality roast beef sandwhiches
[0:06:41] <BoneSkore> Plague of Gripes Journeys to Whitecastle
[0:06:43] <%ralphwiggum16> This is already my favorite story!
[0:06:55] <whittacre> a... semi-quiznos?
[0:06:58] <rittergeist> You drove 30 minutes for fucking Arby's. Do you really hate yourself that much?
[0:07:06] <%boatzndhoez> WoW Amaaazing
[0:07:15] <BoneSkore> can you tell it again?
[0:07:17] <%ralphwiggum16> How was the drive? Scenic?
[0:07:20] <$hypergenn2> sounds about right for fast food
[0:07:26] <%boatzndhoez> Yeah i get that feel
[0:07:37] <whittacre> oooooooo
[0:07:44] <%Mizaiya> holy shit speedrun new tech
[0:07:50] <%ralphwiggum16> I wish you would tell more stories like this.
[0:07:51] <Blak3_Nikos> ha
[0:07:59] <%boatzndhoez> Frealed D:
[0:08:01] <Blak3_Nikos> 👌
[0:08:04] <+Solid_Stro> sabert14Box
[0:08:20] <%boatzndhoez> I watched a episode of her in it again, good times
[0:08:32] <rittergeist> If you do a third DS let's play, will you mod it at all?
[0:08:39] <%ralphwiggum16> Pleasantlee drew a picture of me once! It wasn't bad.
[0:08:43] <%boatzndhoez> Why not use that desktop thing from steam?
[0:08:48] <$hypergenn2> streamlabs is pretty strong
[0:08:49] <Papa_Wolf___> stream labs OBS eats more of your system resources
[0:08:57] <DJDontPanic> streaming stuff is so confusing
[0:08:57] <BoneSkore> Stream Labs OBS is solid, easy to use
[0:09:11] <%lemoan> You ready to torture yourself tongiht?
[0:09:23] <+AntiThule> With Plague's suffering of this series, I'm curious if he would ever try out the Zero Escape series. Nonsensical, but amazing fun imo.
[0:09:25] <Coystick> monke
[0:09:46] <Julkson> I've heard that Streamlabs is easier to use, but you can't extend it and you are stuck with the tools it gives you, while with regular OBS you can download additional plugins
[0:09:47] <whittacre> @AntiThule zero escape is FAR less nonsensical than dangit ron paul
[0:09:47] <DJDontPanic> you just got 2 more games : )
[0:10:09] <Coystick> poor Frealed her version of Lordran was a madhouse
[0:10:35] <%boatzndhoez> What's next afterwards Plague :) ?
[0:10:36] <%Scarnehu> the ps vita one is NOT great
[0:10:43] <+AntiThule> @whittacre true, but the shenanigans are very weird and hilarious
[0:10:54] <%Mizaiya> @Scarnehu oh you mean Despair Girls?
[0:11:04] <Julkson> Danganronpa looks like it was written by bad fanfiction writers, or bad translators
[0:11:14] <%boatzndhoez> ....how did nobody...tell you
[0:11:15] <DJDontPanic> despair girls is really weird and super jank but neat
[0:11:21] <%Scarnehu> @mizaiya yeah
[0:11:28] <%Bigchill___> Plague time
[0:12:09] <DJDontPanic> i love being a fan of these games and seeing plague hate it
[0:12:19] <%Scarnehu> ah man, i remember tri-fusions that some olde schoole plague of gripes
[0:12:29] <%boatzndhoez> Oh god
[0:12:46] <%boatzndhoez> Can...can we mute it
[0:12:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:13:05] <+AntiThule> I forgot how terrible some of the tracks for this game are lol
[0:13:07] <ZComiX> It’s time for daddy grandpas!!
[0:13:20] <+CursedNobleman> this case is supercool
[0:13:27] <$hypergenn2> the movies and your critique is nice
[0:13:37] <ZComiX> I like you Plauge :)
[0:15:14] <%ralphwiggum16> Plague's one of the more likeable people on the internet.
[0:15:15] <SuperVaderMan> Also there was some kind of Ultimate Imposter that was revealed, who may or may not have been fat Byakuya, who knows
[0:15:35] <KgKid51> !uptime
[0:15:35] <@Nightbot> 15 minutes 45 seconds
[0:16:01] <tanarath> plague, are you going to stream the outer wilds dlc?
[0:16:34] <tanarath> You should, it's really great!
[0:17:01] <tanarath> Teaches critical thinking & experimentation. Pat enjoys it a lot.
[0:17:11] <TheLemuroid> Outer Wilds is forever cursed with being confused for Outer Worlds
[0:17:41] <DJDontPanic> she is PO
[0:17:46] <ZComiX> That’s why I watched the anime sangam ronpa , low commitment and it breezes by the stupidity because the cases have to fit in a tv slot
[0:18:08] <vindibeard> angry piglet
[0:18:19] <Coystick> gross
[0:18:37] <franctastic_> LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL LUL
[0:18:42] <SuperVaderMan> Please laugh 4Head
[0:18:48] <+Murimlol> why the diaper
[0:18:53] <franctastic_> LUL LUL
[0:18:57] <$hypergenn2> I'd like to think they keep climbing onto that stool to glare
[0:19:07] <TheLemuroid> I'll say that I remember the 3rd game better than this one
[0:19:08] <%lemoan> @Murimlol Monokuma put her in it
[0:19:35] <Julkson> That sounds too reasonable, so it probably isn't the solution
[0:19:48] <$hypergenn2> awe boring girl died
[0:20:08] <TheLemuroid> What if there was an Ultimate Lawyer?
[0:20:24] <%lemoan> @hypergenn2 that doesn't narrow it down. which do you mean
[0:20:47] <%boatzndhoez> Them boobs though damn
[0:21:07] <JohnClaggart> there's already the ultimate detective in the first game spoilers
[0:21:07] <shotguncrucifix> what indicates torture over a severe can of whoop ass
[0:21:22] <$hypergenn2> @lemoan her shtic was being average and normal
[0:22:00] <$hypergenn2> she used a speaker gun in one of the earlier games
[0:22:13] <shotguncrucifix> oh nevermind just saw that pic ya thats definitely torture
[0:22:14] <%lemoan> @hypergenn2 the one with red hair?
[0:22:38] <$hypergenn2> @lemoan yeah, reddish
[0:23:05] <Coystick> Imagine the fucked up travesties we'd get if we selectively bred bears like we did with wolves to get dogs.
[0:23:16] <%Mizaiya> I know how this case ends and even i dont know what the solution to this bit is
[0:23:18] <%lemoan> @hypergenn2 Mahiru? With he camera?
[0:24:03] <Julkson> Is the game always the same or are the deaths randomized?
[0:24:21] <TheLemuroid> I know the answer to the case but could not tell you how to get there
[0:24:57] <Dlent_> I feel like the being the ultimate yakuza would include torture skills
[0:25:04] <$hypergenn2> @lemoan komaru, thought i saw her in one of the deceased plaques, i never really read the lore too much tho
[0:25:44] <TheAntiNihilist> can't wait till this trial conclusion
[0:25:49] <+Scevda> Evening Eli. Aw yiss.Dungeon grandpas.  Btw a question I had from last time: Do you still peruse either /tg/ or /qst/?
[0:26:23] <%lemoan> @hypergenn2 yeah that's a different girl. The one your thinking of is in another game.
[0:26:53] <$hypergenn2> @lemoan thanks for clearing it up!
[0:26:55] <SuperVaderMan> duct tape would contradict torturing information out of him, right?
[0:27:22] <TheLemuroid> Duct Tape means you can't talk
[0:27:38] <vindibeard> in my experience, this debate took almost all my life, then the rest of the trial went more smoothly
[0:28:07] <SuperVaderMan> hm
[0:28:15] <ehStuGatz> what if mc man was the real killer all along
[0:28:33] <%boatzndhoez> I'm slowly losing my mind
[0:29:01] <JohnClaggart> it seems to drag on more than the first one
[0:29:28] <+king_of_mystery2> Duct tape the tortured part I think
[0:29:30] <%Mizaiya> Oh i looked up the answer it is not clear at all
[0:29:36] <%lemoan> maybe try torture wounds on akane message
[0:29:54] <Clazzimodo> lol
[0:29:54] <TheAntiNihilist> You know what, I just realized this isn't like a trial, it's more like, imagine a jury was thrown into a room with all the evidence and no context GO
[0:29:55] <TheLemuroid> Yeah I'm pretty sure it's "Duct Tape" on "Torture"
[0:30:05] <+Scevda> I feel like this is an issue of translation. They are possibly more related in JP.
[0:30:43] <JohnClaggart> you can just have him write it down
[0:30:51] <SuperVaderMan> Oh, so I was right, the game just put it on the wrong statement
[0:30:57] <+Scevda> No Eli, you can only tape a person's mouth once in life.
[0:30:57] <shotguncrucifix> did dante mention the trials at any point in the divine comedy
[0:31:00] <ZComiX> They say torture, they mean interrogate… lol
[0:31:35] <%boatzndhoez> Yeb
[0:31:53] <TheAntiNihilist> Danganronpa: You too can be an armchair judge
[0:31:54] <%lemoan> Lol tell us how you really feel
[0:31:54] <SanderDCastle> What are we playing next?
[0:32:11] <Coystick> I also play games I don't like.
[0:32:12] <+GuttyGoop> I remember hating the swords
[0:32:16] <vindibeard> i think you take less damage if you let the orange text slide by
[0:32:28] <dk_scrub> how did this game get sequels? this is like a horrible ace attorney
[0:32:31] <Julkson> The gameplay doesn't match with the topic of the game, it is too distracting. I wouldn't be able to pay attention to what they are saying, if it is even important
[0:33:06] <+Scevda> Knock your head against the wildly colored brick wall until it allows you to progress...
[0:33:14] <+asleepathalfmast> this mini game is way better in V3
[0:33:24] <%lemoan> @dk_scrub apparently people actually like the story. bonus points that they like the characters too.
[0:33:45] <TheLemuroid> okay
[0:33:47] <+king_of_mystery2> duct tape after they killed
[0:33:48] <SuperVaderMan> that's fair
[0:33:56] <TheAntiNihilist> YAAAAAY
[0:34:31] <ZComiX> https://www.ign.com/wikis/danganropa-2/Chapter_5_-_Smile_at_Hope_in_the_Name_of_Despair
[0:34:32] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why play it if you don't enjoy it?
[0:34:40] <TheLemuroid> Closure I think
[0:34:43] <%boatzndhoez> he wants to finish it
[0:34:47] <+GemeSvev> suffering is prime content
[0:34:50] <Coystick> BANANI?!
[0:35:28] <+Scevda> It literally just showed blood under the tape.
[0:35:46] <SuperVaderMan> there are redeeming qualities to this game, and all of them are outside of the trials, unfortunately the main focus of the game
[0:36:22] <%ralphwiggum16> I feel like this game is the height of drama.
[0:36:34] <TheLemuroid> BUT CAN YOU SPELL SUICIDE?
[0:36:35] <+Scevda> I see the rainbow dash person is already dead.
[0:36:46] <%boatzndhoez> It is nice to see them dead though
[0:37:01] <+Scevda> er I mean twilight sparkle
[0:37:09] <TheAntiNihilist> @thelemuroid naw too hard. must be something else
[0:37:10] <%ralphwiggum16> @TheLemuroid I thought you wrote, "can you sell suicide" there, and thought that was an incredible point.
[0:37:56] <%ralphwiggum16> I bet it's better in Japanese.
[0:38:27] <dk_scrub> If only a fire would destroy the evidence of this game existing
[0:39:01] <+Scevda> Open the door: oxygen feeds the fire?
[0:39:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i dunno those character but i already hate the guy with violet hair and jumpsuit
[0:39:43] <TheAntiNihilist> like, they could just claim the blood was fake and we'd have to assume it was the truth unless the game decided we should disagree with that statement
[0:39:50] <%boatzndhoez> pvpLeave
[0:39:51] <+Scevda> CONSENT
[0:39:56] <Julkson> Do the pink words mean anything at all?
[0:40:04] <JohnClaggart> consent isnt a two way street
[0:40:12] <whittacre> Well that one guy agreed, better stop the debate
[0:40:27] <SanderDCastle> Oh the main character is voiced by Nero from DMC
[0:40:27] <+Scevda> @whittacre lol
[0:40:33] <vindibeard> @Julkson flavor chatter from the others, sometimes you can infer which person said it
[0:41:07] <shotguncrucifix> Nero gotta eat too
[0:41:29] <+Scevda> and then the person escaped elsewhere
[0:41:30] <+Scevda> ye
[0:41:46] <vindibeard> there a color blind mode for this game?
[0:41:54] <+Scevda> you would still see it opening the door...
[0:43:02] <JohnClaggart> he's the ultimate deviant, plague
[0:43:04] <%silvery_cricket> How
[0:43:11] <+gupa5240> yeah, the old school logo
[0:43:12] <%lemoan> it does kinda loo like the current one
[0:43:14] <+Maleicus> by being loud
[0:43:15] <Tiny_Axolotl> he's the admin
[0:43:38] <+Scevda> I guess its to lead into WHO owns the mp3 player?
[0:43:41] <+GemeSvev> clearly the dominoes are all an elaborate red herring
[0:43:42] <%silvery_cricket> These kids are terrible at murder
[0:43:48] <Dlent_> For fun :)
[0:44:11] <+king_of_mystery2> I love these games but the beginning of a trial, especially later ones is always the worst part with the nonsensical leaps in logic you have to make.
[0:44:13] <vindibeard> reminds me of the bloodborne choir in that one area
[0:44:15] <Tiny_Axolotl> these murders are overly convaluted
[0:44:39] <%silvery_cricket> I dont even know why they bother talking at this point, as the MC clearly has already figured everything out.
[0:45:01] <Clazzimodo> haha boob joke
[0:45:02] <+GemeSvev> Option D) It's a poorly written stupid character trying to  misdirect you
[0:45:11] <%silvery_cricket> Like any other of the kids should know by now you will solve the mystery
[0:45:15] <TheAntiNihilist> don't forget that the murderers rarely interfere with where the trial is heading towards.
[0:45:27] <%lemoan> @silvery_cricket because we need more contrivances and interupttions to make more red herring to derail the court case and-
[0:45:41] <+Scevda> the support beams might, but not the standing part
[0:46:07] <Tiny_Axolotl> Why doesn't anyone try to kill the MC, since he always finds the killer.
[0:46:09] <+Scevda> The Watson?
[0:46:53] <TheLemuroid> You mean an adult?
[0:46:55] <%lemoan> @Tiny_Axolotl technically Nagito found out a lot of the murders. especially the last one.
[0:47:06] <%silvery_cricket> There needs to be a character that is the ULTIMATE SIDEKICK
[0:47:11] <+Scevda> The cynic!... in this universe they would be killed first by these lots
[0:47:11] <Dlent_> The problem was Kyouko had already solved every case entirely by the time the trial started, lol
[0:47:11] <rearedlogarithm> The main character of the Dangan Ronpa games is usually the Watson I think. They're the ones that are reacting to the plot and asking questions of why things work.
[0:47:27] <+GemeSvev> It's an isekai except you get transported to a world where nothing makes sense
[0:47:29] <SuperVaderMan> Plague, that's your character
[0:47:49] <vindibeard> they spontaneously combust
[0:48:18] <%silvery_cricket> I mean they could easily have just opened the door a crack and slipped the carboard in after they set everything up
[0:49:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Just like Mugatu in Zoolander  "i feel like i'm taking crazy pills!"
[0:49:21] <%silvery_cricket> JESUS
[0:50:08] <+Scevda> WHAT IF I KILLED MYSELF. RIGHT NOW. Better than dealing with you morons any longer.
[0:50:40] <+Scevda> red herring, got it
[0:50:47] <TheAntiNihilist> lol
[0:51:01] <%silvery_cricket> He was a little freak
[0:51:01] <Julkson> He was a masochist and got a little bit out of control. He was feeling lonely...
[0:51:02] <franctastic_> PogChamp
[0:51:09] <+Scevda> My friend stabbed himself 23 times before he died so ya, its possible.
[0:51:25] <SanderDCastle> So we aren't at the end of the game?
[0:51:37] <%boatzndhoez> What? you can tie up your own limbs plague LUL
[0:51:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "it was me, Austin! It was  me all along!"
[0:51:42] <%silvery_cricket> SOMEONE TELL DEWEY TO STFU
[0:51:52] <%silvery_cricket> GO BACK TO MALCOM AND THE MIDDLE YOU LITTLE BITCH
[0:52:02] <Dlent_> Imposter? Sounds kinda sus
[0:52:42] <%boatzndhoez> ...
[0:52:46] <%boatzndhoez> I liked that
[0:52:49] <+Scevda> She wants the FRONT TAIL
[0:52:50] <Coystick> suicide by penis
[0:52:59] <+GemeSvev> Front tail isn't long enough ;_;
[0:53:22] <+Scevda> assisted suicide?
[0:53:36] <TheAntiNihilist> @gemesvev OR IS IT! Nagito is the ultimate lucky guy
[0:53:54] <+GemeSvev> We have to re-investigate the crime scene
[0:53:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> she wants múltiple front tails, all  at the same time
[0:54:08] <%lemoan> @GemeSvev check his dick
[0:54:22] <TheLemuroid> How about that first option
[0:54:50] <%silvery_cricket> YEAH CHEAT
[0:54:52] <TheAntiNihilist> burned rope
[0:55:12] <TheLemuroid> Yeah I don't get how it makes any sense
[0:56:03] <%silvery_cricket> IT EVAPORATED
[0:56:26] <+Scevda> they are using the term trap wrong....
[0:56:37] <+Scevda> How about misdirection.
[0:56:41] <TheAntiNihilist> the fire JUST burned the rope a little? it would keep burning down the rope...
[0:56:58] <TheLemuroid> They are also using the term "concrete evidence" wrong
[0:57:22] <%silvery_cricket> There was no fire it was all mist and red flood lights!!!
[0:57:24] <SuperVaderMan> Don't you hate when writers try to be clever, and they just aren't
[0:57:33] <+V3RTIGO_222> papa plague
[0:57:36] <%boatzndhoez> LUL
[0:57:52] <+Scevda> sure
[0:57:54] <+lordericter> wat
[0:58:14] <%sparklinghallow> wow
[0:58:16] <+lordericter> or IS IT
[0:58:19] <TheAntiNihilist> ...prostitution or be easy. THE ONLY 2 CHOICES
[0:58:20] <SuperVaderMan> That was an exchange
[0:58:21] <%silvery_cricket> no its not
[0:58:30] <%lemoan> I-I...what? This games humor is so fucking random sometimes
[0:58:32] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Sonia is not wrong.
[0:58:36] <Coystick> wait no go back to the ben G-man
[0:58:42] <%silvery_cricket> knife on the ground slam your hand on the knife
[0:58:52] <%silvery_cricket> No she gave you a 100 Plague
[0:58:56] <+Scevda> Just like the american justice system
[0:58:57] <xerioes> atleast she knows shes worth a hundred
[0:58:57] <%boatzndhoez> pvpNOD
[0:59:04] <+lordericter> just throw the knife into the air really hard
[0:59:08] <SuperVaderMan> The joke is that akane's dumb
[0:59:11] <Coystick> ooooh because she's dumb
[0:59:12] <%silvery_cricket> Yeah she gave you a hundred dollars to feel her up
[0:59:21] <%lemoan> she's dumb plague you know this
[0:59:23] <TheAntiNihilist> plagues reaction is just as great
[0:59:27] <Julkson> He could have been holding the knife in the other hand
[0:59:30] <%silvery_cricket> She doesn't know how it works
[0:59:36] <Blak3_Nikos> no
[0:59:41] <%lemoan> obviously
[0:59:43] <+Scevda> teeth
[0:59:43] <+GuttyGoop> da money was never real
[0:59:53] <%silvery_cricket> Hold the knife between your legs and then slam your hand down on it
[0:59:58] <+gupa5240> stand the knife up on the floor blade up
[1:00:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that bitch is hot  but damn  she dumb
[1:00:17] <ShadeTheNovice> fix it in place and shove your hand into it?
[1:00:22] <%boatzndhoez> I think the voice actor was losing it too LUL
[1:00:26] <Julkson> If he wanted to suicide, why not just stab himself in the heart or neck?
[1:00:27] <%lemoan> THAT VOICE CRACK
[1:00:53] <TheAntiNihilist> @julkson he's the joker. he won't make things simple.
[1:01:44] <+Scevda> I like the premise of how these minigames are but the implementation along with overcoming a language barrier makes this really clumsy
[1:01:54] <SuperVaderMan> isn't his hand fucking pinned to the ground with the knife? A knife falling doesn't have enough force to do that
[1:01:55] <+lordericter> the plushie?!?
[1:02:19] <%legioned247> is this why your here eli are you here to suffer
[1:02:29] <+king_of_mystery2> agree with the propped the knife
[1:03:07] <TheAntiNihilist> wow. thats hard to guess
[1:03:13] <+Scevda> CONSENT
[1:03:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that sounds like the most overly complicated suicide ever
[1:03:20] <%legioned247> the question there asking are insane
[1:03:40] <%silvery_cricket> he shoved it into the crotch and then gave it a handjob
[1:03:51] <+GemeSvev> rube goldberg suicide machine
[1:04:00] <%lemoan> @silvery_cricket HIS FRONT TAIL
[1:04:16] <%PlebianNoob> Stabbed the plushie?
[1:04:19] <+GemeSvev> BIG HOLE for FRONT TAIL
[1:04:21] <SuperVaderMan> "Makes sense" she says
[1:04:27] <TheAntiNihilist> @gemesvev well of course. he's the Ultimate Lucky guy
[1:04:39] <+Scevda> its into the concrete
[1:04:53] <TheLemuroid> He put the knife in the monokuma doll then slapped it
[1:04:58] <%silvery_cricket> Are we sure he is even dead
[1:05:08] <+Scevda> @silvery_cricket kek
[1:05:11] <%silvery_cricket> the games have lied before
[1:06:17] <%lemoan> what the actual fuck game
[1:06:18] <TheLemuroid> It would be easier to explain with a picture
[1:06:20] <+Scevda> he "waggled" it off
[1:06:34] <+Clyderso> for the handle
[1:06:35] <whittacre> handle in the hole
[1:06:37] <+Maleicus> to prop the knife
[1:06:39] <TheLemuroid> He jammed the knife handle into the hole
[1:06:47] <TheLemuroid> Then slapped it
[1:06:52] <%PlebianNoob> Cut a hole in the doll. Put the handle in the hole. Waved his arms like he was stabbed and threw it off.
[1:07:04] <+Scevda> ye
[1:07:13] <whittacre> ya
[1:07:16] <+Clyderso> ye
[1:07:17] <%silvery_cricket> yea
[1:07:22] <%PlebianNoob> Like a cup holder
[1:07:25] <+GemeSvev> like a gun in a bible, but more stabby
[1:07:26] <+Clyderso> anime
[1:07:33] <%silvery_cricket> to trick you
[1:07:40] <Julkson> Maybe the doll already had a hole. It was one of those special dolls
[1:07:46] <+Scevda> should be?
[1:07:57] <TheMilkyFinishers> To keep the knife upright, and absorb impact of the hand slamming down on it.
[1:08:00] <TheAntiNihilist> yeah...remember the spear...huuuuuh
[1:08:10] <%silvery_cricket> Is there?
[1:08:21] <%silvery_cricket> Once again is he even dead
[1:08:21] <TheAntiNihilist> this game is slowly becoming amazing
[1:08:24] <%boatzndhoez> Is the blood purple to censor or something
[1:08:33] <TheAntiNihilist> @boatzndhoez yes
[1:08:38] <+lordericter> ok
[1:08:38] <+Scevda> Lewd
[1:08:40] <+GemeSvev> OH
[1:08:42] <%silvery_cricket> @boatzndhoez Yeah Japan has super strict restrictions about how much blood can be on screen
[1:08:43] <%boatzndhoez> pvpLaugh
[1:08:44] <%PlebianNoob> Phrasing
[1:08:50] <vonmaultke> pvpDio
[1:08:53] <TheLemuroid> Let's repeat it to emphasize the point
[1:09:06] <+Scevda> put the hood on for no reason
[1:09:10] <franctastic_> Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:09:14] <+lordericter> this is a Video Game
[1:09:29] <Julkson> Two hours later, they suddenly decide he couldn't have commited suicide and all of this was for nothing
[1:09:35] <%boatzndhoez> @boatzndhoez oh man i wonder if he just had a lot of purple drink pvpDio
[1:09:40] <vindibeard> LUL
[1:09:50] <%silvery_cricket> @boatzndhoez They get around it by just making it that ugly purple color, so that way they can have as much blood on screen as they want and get it past censors. anytime you see that pinkish purple color its all blood.
[1:09:51] <TheAntiNihilist> out of context(or even in context) this is the most ridiculous conversation of all time
[1:09:58] <Coystick> These people are a circus act
[1:10:00] <%lemoan> @boatzndhoez yeah it's for censor
[1:10:04] <franctastic_> SeemsGood
[1:10:07] <SuperVaderMan> Obviously he committed suicide by stabbing himself 30 times in the thighs, the hand, the other arm, and with a spear in the torso while tied up on the ground
[1:10:14] <cherrycottontail> yes thats what that means monokuma
[1:10:23] <+Scevda> why is the belly button so prominent....

[1:10:45] <+lordericter> amogus
[1:11:15] <%silvery_cricket> SHE DID IT
[1:11:17] <%lemoan> HOPE
[1:11:19] <+lordericter> Nanami having all that hope
[1:11:19] <Julkson> She's the killer, calling it
[1:11:20] <%lemoan> IT'S THE HOPE
[1:11:23] <TheAntiNihilist> @thelemuroid he loves fucking with people expectations
[1:11:25] <+GemeSvev> "I'll believe in them even as I'm being murdered!"
[1:11:26] <%silvery_cricket> Yeah no she did it
[1:11:27] <+Scevda> Emotion cannot be allowed to mix with logic.
[1:11:36] <%lemoan> NAGITO GONNA COOM IN HIS GRAVE FROM ALL THIS HOOOOPPPE

[1:13:02] <+Scevda> its okay she has tits
[1:13:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> You know people will never do that @PlagueOfGripes . not even real adults.
[1:13:19] <SuperVaderMan> The power of friendship :)
[1:13:27] <%silvery_cricket> "We all murdered him together"
[1:14:00] <cherrycottontail> The Ultimate Gamer is clearly the most powerful power
[1:14:03] <+Scevda> burned rope of a hanging spear.
[1:14:05] <%silvery_cricket> the spear was dangling from a rope
[1:14:08] <%Heart0fInk> He used his feeties!
[1:14:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> suck  each  other 's front tails
[1:14:27] <Tiny_Axolotl> What's an adult anyway? They are just as immature as youg people
[1:15:07] <+king_of_mystery2> You already used the burned rope dude
[1:15:31] <%PlebianNoob> Used the hand that was tied up to pull drop the spear?
[1:15:54] <%boatzndhoez> pvpPause
[1:15:56] <%boatzndhoez> wat
[1:16:00] <+GemeSvev> uhhhh

[1:16:03] <Coystick> Japan
[1:16:06] <Blak3_Nikos> oh yeah
[1:16:23] <%Lobsterdinner> Hi plague, how are you?
[1:16:25] <+Scevda> let go of the other rope from his hand
[1:16:47] <whittacre> he was holding the spear in the left
[1:16:51] <+Scevda> clenched rope grip
[1:17:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> at Best she did dry humping......but it was the most  ferocious dry humping
[1:17:19] <Tiny_Axolotl> Is it just me, or is the mystery particuler really boring?
[1:17:49] <Julkson> He was gripping his front tail
[1:18:27] <whittacre> @PlagueOfGripes They're still working all of this off the supposition that he killed himself
[1:18:30] <+Scevda> IMAGINATIONS
[1:18:36] <%PlebianNoob> That is all that has been done
[1:18:52] <+GemeSvev> "We might have to think" Why weren't you doing that already?
[1:18:58] <%dzmi13> By the way plague are you still uploading your vods to youtube? :)
[1:19:01] <+Scevda> i see it
[1:19:11] <+GemeSvev> ooh dang i didn't notice
[1:20:08] <cherrycottontail> that's correct
[1:20:13] <Coystick> Youtube zombies
[1:20:14] <+lordericter> wow really, the sfx are copyright but the films they are apart of is public domain
[1:20:15] <+GemeSvev> corporate scapegoating
[1:20:19] <%Lobsterdinner> You should draw a scantily-clad furry girl and make a video about it, that'll REALLY show them
[1:20:24] <+lordericter> that's some fuckin pedantic bullshit
[1:20:53] <Coystick> cute hoodie
[1:20:55] <+Scevda> She believes in the front tail.
[1:20:57] <cherrycottontail> did you see the 'i can't believe you've done this' this morning and yesterday? they reverted that 30 minutes after an article was made limesLUL
[1:21:47] <+lordericter> pulled the spear down on him like a light switch
[1:21:50] <%Heart0fInk> LOL i love thh face the cat makes when you did that
[1:21:55] <%Heart0fInk> the*
[1:22:00] <%PlebianNoob> Didn't know your cat model could show that much surprise
[1:22:06] <Coystick> but MY penis is especially sma-hey
[1:22:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a small  front tail
[1:22:28] <whittacre> it's too bad plague never emotes
[1:22:39] <Neoripo> Plague can smile? /jk
[1:22:45] <%Heart0fInk> weird
[1:22:49] <+GemeSvev> that's odd
[1:22:51] <TheLemuroid> How feasible do you think it would be to make a toilet vtuber model? Asking for a friend
[1:22:52] <%boatzndhoez> Still looks pretty good
[1:22:54] <+gupa5240> the expressions got lost in translation
[1:23:11] <vindibeard> nagito wins. fatality.
[1:23:17] <%lemoan> @TheLemuroid i think that already exists
[1:23:25] <%Lobsterdinner> plague needs an emote where he bulges his eyes out and yells "hubba hubba!"
[1:23:38] <whittacre> Hmmmmmmmmmmm
[1:23:43] <cherrycottontail> "A pulley system"
[1:24:01] <+GemeSvev> if there were girders or whatever it's be simple to make a pulley system
[1:24:08] <TheLemuroid> Are we going to have to spell "pulley"?
[1:24:27] <+Scevda> Things that are up come down :-O
[1:24:39] <+reiface08> CAN YOU SPELL THE WORD GRAVITY
[1:24:48] <+lordericter> ohh
[1:24:48] <whittacre> wat
[1:24:55] <SuperVaderMan> But can you surf to discover gravity, IN CYBERSPACE
[1:25:05] <+GemeSvev> "He looks like he's about to spell something." Is a sentence I never thought I'd hear spoken, let alone with such disdain.
[1:25:09] <%vehementvadr> down the "logic" hole
[1:25:17] <%Heart0fInk> Not a mind palace but a mind skate park..
[1:25:22] <+lordericter> sick shredding in beat surfer for deductive reasoning
[1:25:23] <%boatzndhoez> i kinda hate this game LUL

[1:26:18] <Neoripo> Holy shit the codec hates logic dive
[1:26:56] <cherrycottontail> im just hearing the sonic music
[1:27:14] <+lordericter> not in this game you can't
[1:27:19] <%lemoan> @emptyantics he answered someones similar question. Basically he didn't realize how much he distains the game til later in. So he just though "might as well get this over with"
[1:27:20] <%Heart0fInk> In an animu game? Never..
[1:27:37] <%boatzndhoez> haahaha
[1:27:43] <SuperVaderMan> IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW
[1:27:49] <whittacre> what an awful, awful mechanic
[1:27:55] <%boatzndhoez> it does have weird comedic timings
[1:27:55] <emptyantics> Dangangropa was a mistake
[1:28:09] <Tiny_Axolotl> @lemoan ya, that was my question LUL LUL
[1:28:12] <%vehementvadr> he lern thru surfing the microwaves in his microwave
[1:28:23] <vindibeard> that would be sooooo metal but
[1:29:17] <%Heart0fInk> Japanese warehouses are smaller.
[1:29:20] <+lordericter> wow those whips are long
[1:29:35] <+Scevda> thats not long enough/high enough it needs to be to have a enough force for a good stab
[1:29:41] <Parksy862> 4Head sir ur retarded
[1:29:46] <+Mekhet09> You are going to mad after thsi.
[1:29:49] <+Mekhet09> I'm sorry.
[1:30:03] <+gupa5240> more force means more weight on the spearhead right? or are my physics wrong?
[1:30:20] <%Heart0fInk> that was a 'the Japanese are short' joke..
[1:30:21] <+GemeSvev> Amazon raises warehouse worker satisfaction by giving them girders to swing on
[1:30:37] <emptyantics> I work at a warehouse in Shinjuku they are not small
[1:30:53] <Julkson> So all of this section was a waste of time
[1:31:12] <%lemoan> @Julkson that sounds like danganronpa
[1:31:26] <+lordericter> he used it differently because he had been impaled Nagito
[1:31:36] <+Scevda> castle super beast talked about this phenomenon, where you know when something is not going to be the solution because it was too soon in the duration of episode/story.
[1:31:51] <+Scevda> I hope theres a name for it
[1:31:56] <+lordericter> this dude loves using that hand
[1:31:59] <%boatzndhoez> OR maybe the murderer did that to make it seem like a suicide :O
[1:32:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> Does he feel no pain?
[1:32:15] <%akumakid13> So he is just on alot of morphine
[1:32:15] <franctastic_> HE HOPED TOO HARD Kreygasm
[1:32:17] <%vehementvadr> the real question was why by spear? heart disease not god enough? you sick fucky wucky
[1:32:55] <%lemoan> @franctastic_ Don't talk about hope. you're gonna make me hope msyelf
[1:32:59] <+polothegreatest> spite LUL
[1:33:24] <%vehementvadr> pretty sure you could achieve the same result by sliting your throat
[1:33:28] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:33:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> The irony of a bunch of japanese high Schoolers disbelieving one of them would not commit suicide
[1:33:50] <+GemeSvev> Yo does anyone ever go full Among Us and get multiple kills before a body is found in this series?
[1:33:51] <+reiface08> that sounds pretty rad Gripes
[1:34:00] <+Mekhet09> @morcego_cinzento_arts That's dark.
[1:34:36] <%lemoan> "eh who cares he dead now...bye"

[1:36:06] <%vehementvadr> what? was there sarin gas in the room too?
[1:36:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> He killed himself in the most brutal as a "fuck you" to  evv

[1:37:52] <+Mekhet09> Shhhh
[1:38:15] <%lemoan> probably gonna need that youtube video
[1:38:18] <%vehementvadr> fun fact: that mask is outdated
[1:38:38] <%lemoan> Nagito dying is a happy ending in my book
[1:39:04] <+GemeSvev> "Now you see, evil will always win, because good is dumb.
[1:39:25] <+Scevda> " I want you guys"
[1:39:29] <%boatzndhoez> Because nobody says that in this context?

[1:40:13] <ELLIPZZZthaPROFIT> It’s not really more vague, just really different.
[1:40:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i get the feeling that the writters themselves don't care for the "despair" angle
[1:40:25] <+polothegreatest> everyone is sus
[1:41:08] <+Mekhet09> The MP3 or monokuma I think.
[1:41:28] <+Scevda> poison poison poison
[1:41:37] <%lemoan> Did we figure out who started the fire?
[1:42:13] <Solokaldaka> oh god I missed an hour what craziness happened this time?
[1:42:18] <vindibeard> it was always burning
[1:42:36] <cherrycottontail> badge
[1:42:57] <Ayralynn> Something wrong with the death file?

[1:52:00] <%Artista_AF> yeah pretty much
[1:52:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> This is very repetitive
[1:53:09] <+lordericter> its why I hated the last case a lot

[1:58:50] <+king_of_mystery2> They aren't lawyers plague
[1:58:51] <whittacre> so their current strategy IN GAME is the ol' point-n-click rub everything on everything until progress happens?
[1:58:55] <%vehementvadr> anime courts are an oxymoron
[1:58:58] <lol_red_ranger> the evidence shitshow is part of the appeal alright, it's fine
[1:59:03] <+king_of_mystery2> monokuma probably doesn't know that either

[2:01:31] <SuperVaderMan> It's a poison. It's really powerful, especially against living things
[2:01:32] <Erwin_Dedic> Man, gotta love all those life giving poisons.
[2:01:53] <%kyh9> OH THANK GOD, HES DEAD
[2:01:57] <%legioned247> I confused
[2:02:11] <%legioned247> but he needed to die
[2:02:30] <%vehementvadr> not every poison gives you blood blotches but whatever
[2:02:43] <abureaucrat> Ah yes, the poison. Monokuma's Poison.  The poison for -wait, it's not for monokuma?
[2:02:45] <%legioned247> who ever killed him get a award and a present
[2:03:05] <%legioned247> slow 👏
[2:03:38] <%legioned247> magic poison
[2:03:39] <%vehementvadr> where did Nagito get a nerve agent?
[2:03:40] <whittacre> it's heavier than air!
[2:03:43] <+GemeSvev> Does that mean it kills instantly or you start feeling symptoms immediately
[2:03:51] <whittacre> he lay down into poison gas
[2:03:52] <+lordericter> ohhhhh
[2:04:04] <+GemeSvev> She's so hyped for the tail
[2:04:04] <+lordericter> I see this stupid twist
[2:04:16] <TheAntiNihilist> Nagito would
[2:04:26] <JohnClaggart> women hard ons are noticeable
[2:04:29] <+GemeSvev> @TheAntiNihilist more like "Nagito wood"
[2:04:46] <SuperVaderMan> jk 4Head
[2:04:59] <+MortXII> Will you be watching the Danganronpa 3 anime after this game Plague?
[2:05:02] <%lemoan> jk gotta delay the trial more
[2:05:08] <%legioned247> fun fact cyanide is a compound that exists naturally in nature and plants and animals use it as both defense and offensive uses
[2:05:12] <+GemeSvev> so did he hold onto the spear cord until the poison killed him or what
[2:05:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> when having  a stiff means two  things
[2:05:36] <%legioned247> WHY DO YOU SUFFER ELI
[2:05:37] <%Heart0fInk> Easy. Don't..
[2:05:39] <Blak3_Nikos> don't play 3
[2:05:40] <+polothegreatest> so here i am...
[2:05:40] <+CalderGaming> "now"??
[2:05:45] <Blak3_Nikos> you'll hate it
[2:05:46] <%vehementvadr> it was vx gas if anything, some of the quickest acting stuff
[2:05:46] <+lordericter> we could always not do Dingle my Rompus3
[2:05:47] <Eightgutter> danganronpa v3 is an experience
[2:05:53] <+porkduckrice> why not ace attorney?
[2:05:57] <%Heart0fInk> it's the easiest thing to do ever. not doing it
[2:06:01] <+lordericter> just play an Ace Attorney game instead
[2:06:02] <Julkson> I've heard there are detective conan games. I would hope those are better
[2:06:09] <+lordericter> yeah
[2:06:11] <%boatzndhoez> yes
[2:06:12] <filthywanko> Im curious of what you would think of V3
[2:06:13] <%lemoan> i do
[2:06:13] <vindibeard> daytonaaaaaa
[2:06:14] <whittacre> I only drive manual's
[2:06:14] <%legioned247> I DRIVE STICK
[2:06:17] <%xiccy> nope
[2:06:17] <%vehementvadr> sticks are for trees
[2:06:17] <+GemeSvev> On one hand, this has been incredibly entertaining, on the other hand, too much suffering might make for a difficult stream
[2:06:18] <comedeity> no
[2:06:19] <+lordericter> I've driven tractors in the past
[2:06:19] <%lemoan> I hate it but yeah
[2:06:23] <+Mekhet09> I want to se how you react to the end of DR3.
[2:06:23] <%legioned247> do you drive balls
[2:06:26] <+MortXII> Yarp
[2:06:29] <+guy_withhoodie> Yes
[2:06:32] <%legioned247> lol
[2:06:33] <%Heart0fInk> I can't drive. i'm scared of driving
[2:06:35] <+GemeSvev> I learned stick for golf carts, does that count
[2:06:36] <%Lobsterdinner> I didn't want to learn how to drive stick, but I learned
[2:06:36] <TheAntiNihilist> V3 is very different, but yeah just play death stranding
[2:06:38] <vonmaultke> I only use manual with motorcycles
[2:06:40] <+lordericter> our 1992 international still has a clutch
[2:06:41] <Dlent_> It’s been a few years, but yeah
[2:07:02] <+Scevda> I would advocate to play it with someone present. Have someone to trudge it through and laugh at it together would make it more pallatable.
[2:07:10] <filthywanko> @Heart0fInk Im scared of driving too, but you can do it. Ive recently gotten the hang of it myself. Its not that bad
[2:07:12] <%lemoan> THIS WAS HAJIME'S TRUE TALENT. BEING RAD AT SKATEBOARDING
[2:07:15] <%akumakid13> What have you heard of Dan3?
[2:07:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> what does "driving a stick " means?
[2:07:31] <whittacre> @morcego_cinzento_arts manual transmission
[2:07:37] <%boatzndhoez> my eyes hurt
[2:07:51] <%legioned247> it was a good eli he rub the poison in
[2:07:52] <%lemoan> @morcego_cinzento_arts a stick shift/manual
[2:07:54] <%legioned247> lol
[2:07:56] <+lordericter> he's a sea cucumber he breathes through the rectum
[2:08:00] <%Lobsterdinner> When I take a test, I need to mentally skateboard in a tube
[2:08:01] <+GemeSvev> @morcego_cinzento_arts It's when a car, or other vehicle has manual transmission. So called because usually it's controlled by a "Stick" that's next to the driver.
[2:08:04] <Julkson> The third woul have been "did it drink it or breath it in?
[2:08:05] <%Heart0fInk> Why did they even a LOT of this game
[2:08:10] <%vehementvadr> a good question would be what the toxin in question is?
[2:08:17] <%legioned247> I love that you said god dam it
[2:08:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> thanks whittacre and lemoan
[2:08:39] <%Lobsterdinner> It has some okay levels of cute girls though tbh
[2:09:23] <%legioned247> your just tired of this shit eli you gone old retire cop on my you tired of this shit
[2:09:39] <%legioned247> on my
[2:09:45] <%legioned247> on me
[2:10:02] <%vehementvadr> it would not neutralize that fast but eh
[2:10:05] <%HawkGoggles2> Yes
[2:10:08] <+Scevda> Yes
[2:10:09] <+lordericter> yepp
[2:10:10] <%Lobsterdinner> My point exactly
[2:10:11] <+SkyZanon> the artist is great
[2:10:13] <%legioned247> the grills
[2:10:13] <+GemeSvev> yee
[2:10:15] <TheAntiNihilist> Chiaki had a pikachu face there
[2:10:15] <%Johnmaddened> love the art
[2:10:32] <+lordericter> his lasting accomplishment is still the Count of Monte Cristo
[2:10:34] <%legioned247> lol
[2:10:37] <%Lobsterdinner> Validate me you recalcitrant feline
[2:10:48] <%boatzndhoez> pvpNOD
[2:10:57] <+slothermun27> EUREKA
[2:10:57] <Solokaldaka> now that's what i call job security
[2:11:01] <%legioned247> the fuck
[2:11:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> it's Goodyear character design
[2:11:33] <%legioned247> how do you know so much about high concepts like hydralsis
[2:11:38] <+Scevda> poison poison poison
[2:11:50] <%Heart0fInk> All sats into Intelligence and NONE into wisdom
[2:11:51] <+polothegreatest> dumb luck LUL
[2:12:07] <SuperVaderMan> Because the poison exists, that means he died from it (?????)
[2:12:36] <%Lobsterdinner> I think Eli did it
[2:12:53] <+Mekhet09> Because you don't like him lol.
[2:12:54] <+lordericter> we were always the killer of our farts
[2:12:58] <+lordericter> hearts
[2:13:00] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:13:02] <%lemoan> @Lobsterdinner oh definetely. He's been trying to fool us
[2:13:15] <%Heart0fInk> wouldn't you find ALL this out via an autopsy?
[2:13:28] <+lordericter> its all conjecture
[2:13:34] <SuperVaderMan> I like how these stupid pricks are trying to rush the voting process. Like, if you get it wrong, you're dead. What
[2:13:49] <%lemoan> baby gangsta
[2:14:34] <+lordericter> wow this is taking a lot of fucking steps
[2:14:44] <+Maleicus> the meat on the bone les go
[2:14:49] <%vehementvadr> assisted suicide is still murder kinda, so not fully wrong
[2:14:49] <lol_red_ranger> BONE ON THE MEAT
[2:14:54] <+lordericter> for something I think we all got when it was revealed that the poison was airborn
[2:14:55] <%lemoan> the bone on the meat
[2:14:56] <JohnClaggart> meat on the bone is waifu answer
[2:15:15] <+Maleicus> assisted suicide would probably count as murder
[2:15:22] <+MortXII> Danganronpa but it's all caveman
[2:15:46] <%lemoan> @Maleicus I think it would depend on what exactly you "assited" with.
[2:16:01] <%Heart0fInk> there would be a puddle
[2:16:26] <+MortXII> Chug think Grug hit him with club
[2:16:40] <%vehementvadr> caveman intrigued by quick acting neurotoxin
[2:17:01] <+kewlmyc> Still think that out of all of the cases in all of the games, this one is the most clever.
[2:17:51] <%Samex_Comex> Finally time to bury Grandpa
[2:18:12] <+Mekhet09> monokuma doesn't care remember the first game where one of the trials was a suicide and he tried to get them to pin it on each other.
[2:18:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> monochuma probably chances the rules on a whim
[2:18:41] <%boatzndhoez> He LOOKS like hes taking a shit
[2:18:43] <SuperVaderMan> Are Kazuichi AND boss baby the accomplices? They're both trying to rush this
[2:18:59] <+illoonar> thatsnogood! imaDisgust
[2:19:00] <mlntymini> is this baby ichigo?
[2:19:05] <%vehementvadr> unless he smurdered himself and someone just really didnt like nagita's corpse
[2:19:12] <flamingkm> Wasn't nagito a prick anyway
[2:19:37] <+lordericter> FUCK
[2:19:46] <+kewlmyc> Yeah, each game has 6 trials iirc
[2:19:47] <JohnClaggart> there's always another trial
[2:19:50] <+lordericter> hope its a last trial like game 1
[2:20:01] <+lordericter> and not just kill down to 3 people
[2:20:33] <+lordericter> IU can tell this one
[2:20:36] <SuperVaderMan> did he fill the fire grenades with poison
[2:20:37] <+lordericter> its Fire Grenage
[2:20:41] <comedeity> ^
[2:20:43] <+lordericter> Grenade*
[2:20:46] <%lemoan> BUT CAN YOU SPELL-
[2:20:47] <+kewlmyc> Hangman gambit is the worst minigame
[2:20:50] <Dlent_> Fire Granola
[2:20:53] <%Samex_Comex> Die hangman gambit
[2:21:00] <SuperVaderMan> So all the the students are the killers LUL
[2:22:24] <Julkson> Fire Gonads
[2:22:25] <+lordericter> @SuperVaderMan yep
[2:22:31] <+lordericter> he made us all his killer
[2:22:41] <+lordericter> that was his plan
[2:22:58] <%akumakid13> skezzo?
[2:23:03] <vindibeard> like that room mikan used to stage the hanging
[2:23:16] <+lordericter> its also why the fire got worse when they threw it
[2:23:30] <+GemeSvev> molotov or napalm?
[2:23:40] <%vehementvadr> incindiary grenades? yay those exist
[2:23:48] <+CalderGaming> YEAH IT'S PRETTY STUPID AND CONVOLUTED
[2:23:54] <%vehementvadr> m14
[2:24:02] <+CalderGaming> @vehementvadr no, grenades for extinguishing fires
[2:24:17] <%vehementvadr> oh oopsy
[2:24:33] <+lordericter> they are a special plastic
[2:24:39] <franctastic_> Seems reasonable to me SeemsGood
[2:24:42] <+lordericter> that's why they burst when heated quickly
[2:25:25] <%boatzndhoez> plagueFace
[2:25:33] <%lemoan> plagueFace plagueFace
[2:25:42] <%Explodincatz> plagueFace
[2:26:01] <+CalderGaming> that makes sense.
[2:26:06] <+lordericter> yeah you toss the bag into your tank and then add like 100 gallons
[2:26:15] <JohnClaggart> people dont know what pesticides are
[2:26:26] <lol_red_ranger> people don't know what bags are
[2:26:33] <franctastic_> SeemsGood
[2:26:43] <+lordericter> alternatively we but a lot of drums of herbicide and use a special pump to get the mixture right when diluting it
[2:26:48] <+lordericter> buy*
[2:26:58] <+lordericter> good ole roundup
[2:27:11] <%vehementvadr> theres still agent orange in my ears from nam what?
[2:27:22] <lol_red_ranger> his cottage in the woods by a cute little brook
[2:27:37] <franctastic_> LUL
[2:27:49] <%Heart0fInk> They were investigating his cottage cheese ass.
[2:27:58] <SuperVaderMan> So he peeled the seal off the grenade and trekked all the way back to his cabin to hide it under the bed so the player could come to this conclusion
[2:28:12] <+TridentBerryBurst> Yes, we know
[2:28:17] <+lordericter> yeah
[2:28:26] <%lemoan> I wasn't aware
[2:28:29] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[2:28:50] <vonmaultke> hiding shit under his bed LUL
[2:28:51] <%vehementvadr> does he know those filters don't belong on that mask?
[2:29:00] <%Heart0fInk> Or if you live downwind from a farm field like me it makes your mouth numb.
[2:29:12] <%lemoan> "JUST ACCEPT HE COMMITED FUCKING SUICIDE"
[2:29:19] <+lordericter> my father is both an auto tech and farmer, and now he is on seizure medication.  We both also have perpetually cracked hands
[2:29:40] <+Mekhet09> He tricked someone into killing him.
[2:29:48] <+Mekhet09> So they're the murderer.
[2:30:03] <franctastic_> GET TO THE POINT
[2:30:20] <bleugh> monokuma is the law
[2:30:38] <+kewlmyc> Legally, no they wouldn't be murders. But this is Monokuma's fucked up world.
[2:30:46] <castlerock42> Probably some kind of accidental manslaughter.
[2:31:10] <franctastic_> I SEE
[2:31:16] <franctastic_> NotLikeThis
[2:31:39] <+Scevda> or the fire would have burned it off
[2:31:39] <cherrycottontail> plus also fire
[2:31:40] <%Heart0fInk> why did they throw fire gernades?
[2:32:02] <%lemoan> @Heart0fInk to extinguish the fire grenade
[2:32:07] <+Maleicus> because there was a fire
[2:32:12] <%lemoan> @Heart0fInk fire
[2:32:17] <+CalderGaming> to put out the fire. why the sprinklers conveniently came on AFTER that is Game Logic
[2:32:28] <%vehementvadr> why didn't they just get a hose?
[2:32:30] <+lordericter> I would assume Nagito
[2:32:32] <%Heart0fInk> @lemoan thats... stupid..
[2:32:40] <+CalderGaming> it sure is
[2:32:52] <+Mekhet09> Try monomi.
[2:33:01] <+lordericter> also Nagito
[2:33:27] <+lordericter> to smoke out the traitor?
[2:33:39] <+Maleicus> it makes perfect sense
[2:33:45] <+lordericter> are you going to stretch this to be the traitor is the murderer Chiaki??
[2:33:51] <%vehementvadr> because party rocker in the house tonight?
[2:34:26] <%DCR1311> DCR1311 subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:35:13] <%Heart0fInk> He killed 1310 other DCR's before him.
[2:35:16] <%boatzndhoez> throw up a little
[2:35:18] <+lordericter> like, Nya~
[2:35:20] <%boatzndhoez> for your subs
[2:35:21] <cherrycottontail> don't forget your ara ara
[2:37:02] <SuperVaderMan> There were like 20 grenades there, what if they never grabbed the poison grenade
[2:37:04] <+lordericter> how is this unsolvable, he just handed someone a murder weapon they would unknowingly use
[2:37:21] <%Murphio_GS> Force LUL man Nagito is such a dumbass
[2:37:25] <+lordericter> I guess now that we know monokuma will whip out footage of who threw the poison one and murder them
[2:37:35] <+Maleicus> how do you know who used the poison grenade
[2:37:37] <%Murphio_GS> "I'll force you to kill me! "
[2:38:36] <%vehementvadr> I mean it depends on the poison gas
[2:38:43] <+lordericter> I'll force you to make me, kill me
[2:39:15] <+kewlmyc> Cause he's a troll
[2:39:18] <+lordericter> This is like Byakuya's meddling cranked to 100
[2:39:19] <%Heart0fInk> yes
[2:39:20] <+polothegreatest> it was one of 47s poison
[2:39:34] <%Murphio_GS> Mundane suicide vs insane suicide
[2:39:54] <%apocplz> nalvHuh
[2:40:01] <%lemoan> these are NOt educated guesses. These are HUGE fuckinkling leaping in logic
[2:40:12] <+Maleicus> besides the murderer yes
[2:40:13] <+polothegreatest> murder/suicide
[2:40:25] <+lordericter> no he didn't
[2:40:41] <%Heart0fInk> japan and despair.. god i hate it..
[2:40:44] <%vehementvadr> we envy nagito, he doesn't have to live through the rest of this game
[2:41:15] <%Murphio_GS> He did it
[2:41:24] <+lordericter> I mean we can still just accuse the corpse yeah
[2:41:30] <+lordericter> he planted the poison
[2:41:51] <+polothegreatest> no baby boss majima NotLikeThis
[2:41:54] <%lemoan> @Lobsterdinner lol imagine they still execute his dead body
[2:42:21] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah, just find the grenade fragment with the broken seal, and do some fingerprinting
[2:42:35] <+CalderGaming> fRoM tHe TwIsTeD MiNd Of KaZuTaKa KoDakA
[2:42:49] <%apocplz> gruntCringe
[2:42:52] <%boatzndhoez> wat

[2:43:08] <%Murphio_GS> Sus
[2:43:09] <+lordericter> its no great loss
[2:43:21] <+slothermun27> this makes no fucking sense
[2:43:32] <+Mekhet09> The answer makes sense.
[2:43:33] <+GemeSvev> "Gasp! I DID peepeepoopoo!"
[2:43:36] <+Mekhet09> But you aren't going to like it.
[2:43:37] <Daxalog> Thats Danganronpa logic
[2:43:54] <%vehementvadr> how do we know you didnt just follow Sonia around all day yesterday?
[2:44:08] <%lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes  because monokuma is a magical bear that has unlimited anime powers
[2:44:10] <%Heart0fInk> was it just one? Or all of them?
[2:44:15] <%apocplz> "i know that you used the bathroom" - "wow he's omniscient nalvPog "
[2:44:17] <+lordericter> chiaki why
[2:44:42] <+CalderGaming> hunch n crunch hinata
[2:45:01] <Daxalog> Id like one of these games to have Hajime actually commit a murder and you have to dodge questions and stall
[2:45:05] <%lemoan> oh we done already? the fuck?
[2:45:19] <%boatzndhoez> just look it up!
[2:45:29] <%vehementvadr> i measure my McDonald's in the amount of despair I will get when I'm 88 before I eat it
[2:45:37] <%boatzndhoez> LUL
[2:45:37] <+slothermun27> so this nagito guy killed himself for lols?
[2:45:43] <+lordericter> he loves it

[2:46:06] <%lemoan> that is so fucking stupid og my god
[2:46:16] <+Maleicus> if you do it fast and hard enough
[2:47:08] <+Mekhet09> spear.
[2:47:24] <+Mekhet09> spear goes with spear.
[2:50:25] <%boatzndhoez> plagueGripes_TK
[2:50:27] <cerazor01> Your plushie is ready
[2:50:46] <%lemoan> you tend to figure these out pretty quickly
[2:51:04] <TheLemuroid> Here we go
[2:51:14] <+slothermun27> did the evil bears force him to do this. I don't understand why anyone would willingly do this to themselves
[2:51:15] <%Samex_Comex> Dun dun
[2:51:23] <%Explodincatz> dumb dumb
[2:51:27] <%boatzndhoez> kitty dead
[2:51:28] <%Heart0fInk> Aww. kitty fell asleep
[2:51:38] <TheLemuroid> He committed suicide by poison but Monokuma chooses not to interpret it that way
[2:51:47] <+Maleicus> nagito is crazy, thats why
[2:51:51] <%vehementvadr> what the fuck ks the octogon?
[2:52:01] <%Heart0fInk> Cat Awaken!
[2:52:17] <flamingkm> when you know plague has totally stopped giving a fuck about this game
[2:52:36] <%Heart0fInk> Ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..?
[2:52:39] <%vehementvadr> he took the mask of really fat
[2:52:40] <TheLemuroid> It would have been clean if he didn't peel off the aluminum

[2:52:46] <+Maleicus> da dun
[2:52:46] <+lordericter> Dadun
[2:52:48] <+Mekhet09> DA-DUH
[2:52:50] <%akumakid13> da dun
[2:52:54] <Julkson> Nude Dad
[2:52:55] <hamahiroyuki> japanese onomatopeia are stupid LUL
[2:52:55] <%lemoan> D-DAD IS THAT YOU
[2:53:02] <%Murphio_GS> nudad
[2:53:04] <Daxalog> Gutsmans Ass sound effec
[2:53:04] <%Heart0fInk> Dez Nads. Got it
[2:53:50] <flamingkm> lol so he killed himself for nothing?  that's fucking stupid.
[2:54:24] <%Murphio_GS> Nagito is one of those well known characters, so he must be well known for being a dumbass
[2:54:36] <+Mekhet09> The suicide trial in one is much similar.
[2:54:39] <%akumakid13> so how do you think this is going to end
[2:54:45] <%akumakid13> the case
[2:54:53] <TheLemuroid> V3 has a better version of this IMO
[2:55:10] <%Samex_Comex> Can we have some?
[2:55:13] <%Heart0fInk> Yeah they're strange tasting.
[2:55:28] <flamingkm> plague is addicted.  someone laced drugs into it
[2:55:35] <+Mekhet09> Oh no.
[2:55:44] <LunarRemix> God so many steps on this plan
[2:55:59] <Julkson> It would be funny if he accidentally let go of the spear early
[2:56:21] <%lemoan> @Julkson another reason this plan is stupid complicated
[2:56:27] <%Heart0fInk> I hate cheese flavored things. Except cheetos which is dumb..
[2:56:42] <%Artista_AF> Docheetos
[2:56:43] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito had really high faith in his ability to hold onto that spear, considering he stabbed himself a million times WHILE HOLDING THE SPEAR
[2:56:52] <%Samex_Comex> The bag of bones white cheddar cheetos are my favorite
[2:57:12] <+Mekhet09> Perspective in Dangan rompa is fucked.
[2:57:27] <flamingkm> this is kinda stupid but it's funny how stupid it really is
[2:57:43] <%Scarnehu> its so stupid it can't fail!!
[2:57:51] <Tiny_Axolotl> What's the point of all this again?
[2:57:58] <%lemoan> @flamingkm I'd find it funnier if this wasn't taken dead seriously by the characters
[2:58:04] <+GemeSvev> @Tiny_Axolotl DESPAIR
[2:58:10] <+slothermun27> this is the most elaborate eccentric gottem I've ever witnessed
[2:58:29] <vindibeard> i think it was more slashing than stabbing, but even then :P
[2:58:34] <Seth_Tek> he totally didn't strike a nerve and have a reactionary spasm causing him to let go the spear while stabbing himself
[2:58:39] <SuperVaderMan> There are so many moving parts to this plan. If any one of them failed, he would've just bled out on the ground like a dumbass
[2:59:03] <%Explodincatz> @SuperVaderMan hes THAT awsome to fail
[2:59:05] <%lemoan> @SuperVaderMan not that would have been funny
[2:59:14] <%lemoan> @SuperVaderMan now*
[2:59:27] <AsheStariel> But he's the Ultimate Lucky Student. He knew it would work the way he wanted it to
[2:59:29] <%Heart0fInk> except the plushes i guess?
[2:59:38] <%Heart0fInk> it was a plush factory right?
[2:59:44] <%Samex_Comex> Oops I dropped my gernade
[2:59:49] <+kewlmyc> It would end with Nagito just having committing suicide.
[2:59:50] <%Scarnehu> fuck this shit is dumb.  i love it
[3:00:08] <+MortXII> Probs make some shit up about hope
[3:00:14] <%akumakid13> drops the spear
[3:00:41] <flamingkm> why would you attempt such a convoluted suicide.  there'd be such a large chance of failing
[3:00:43] <franctastic_> it would've been pretty awkward if no had thrown the poison
[3:00:59] <franctastic_> no one
[3:01:15] <castlerock42> Arm, hand, legs. He should have totally bled out.
[3:01:23] <mynameiscelestialudenberg> nagito wtf
[3:01:23] <%Scarnehu> that's the most extra suicide imaginable
[3:01:26] <%Explodincatz> we will never reach the truth
[3:01:32] <%lemoan> akane is the giant for sure
[3:01:33] <Spiggerus> The killer was the friends we made along the way @PlagueOfGripes
[3:01:48] <%lemoan> baby gansta is angry one bottom front
[3:01:50] <franctastic_> nah akane is the one looking to the left
[3:02:02] <SuperVaderMan> Kazuichi is the one with the long mouth in the background
[3:02:03] <+lordericter> no we are the back right I think
[3:02:04] <%Heart0fInk> the one comeing out of the anus. yes
[3:02:13] <+lordericter> ohh ok
[3:02:13] <%Samex_Comex> The baby is escapeing that guys ass
[3:02:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> ,mafia baby i coming out of a butt
[3:02:19] <+kewlmyc> Nailed it. Good job
[3:02:19] <%boatzndhoez> easy enough
[3:02:21] <%lemoan> I HAD ALL OF THEM RIGHT
[3:02:21] <filthywanko> W
[3:02:35] <franctastic_> that's a pretty weird pose for Hajime
[3:02:36] <+Mekhet09> LITERALLY NO.
[3:03:09] <%lemoan> JUST VOTE FOR NAGITO AND FUCK OFF
[3:03:26] <franctastic_> H O P E Kreygasm
[3:03:27] <+Maleicus> just potentially get it wrong and die yes
[3:03:34] <SuperVaderMan> Nagito just wants to HOPE all the time
[3:04:12] <+lordericter> The MC
[3:04:24] <%Samex_Comex> After I hope I feel despair
[3:04:25] <TheLemuroid> LUCK
[3:04:26] <%lemoan> DESPAIR YYEEEEAAAAAHHH
[3:05:07] <Julkson> I really dislike when they say "Ultimate"
[3:05:22] <%Samex_Comex> Gundham was breeding the whole game!?
[3:05:30] <TheLemuroid> @Julkson Would you prefer "Super Duper Highschool" whatever?
[3:05:41] <+lordericter> he used 5 bullets
[3:05:48] <+TridentBerryBurst> Man, I kinda just want to punch all of these kids
[3:06:25] <+Maleicus> or the traitor
[3:06:32] <%Heart0fInk> He factored in luck guys! He's so smrt
[3:06:34] <franctastic_> yeah, they are not THE BEST at what they do, they are part of that group, "Super high school level" is the original title
[3:06:48] <%lemoan> god please draw her
[3:06:54] <TheLemuroid> Now for some "sound reasoning"
[3:07:09] <castlerock42> So he was an idiot.
[3:07:10] <+CalderGaming> fRoM tHe TwIsTeD MiNd Of KaZuTaKa KoDakA
[3:07:16] <%Artista_AF> yeah that sounds like Nagito's brand of stupidity
[3:07:18] <%Explodincatz> LUCKY TED strikes again
[3:07:23] <+illoonar> but didn't you say, Akane is already perfect as she is?
[3:07:29] <+polothegreatest> hot=morally grey LUL
[3:07:31] <%boatzndhoez> pvpThink
[3:07:37] <Julkson> @TheLemuroid That would at least sound like they aren't taking themselves seriously
[3:07:40] <%Samex_Comex> Magic is real
[3:08:15] <+slothermun27> reeeeally. what a absolute bafoon
[3:08:19] <%lemoan> WE ALREADY FUCKIONG KNEW THAT GAME!  HE SAID IT AT THE VERY BEGINNING
[3:08:32] <SuperVaderMan> I guess the only way to weed out the traitor is to kill myself. Guess I'll die
[3:08:33] <%Explodincatz> Y O L O
[3:08:34] <TheLemuroid> And thanks to the his Ultimate Luck and the fact that the story is linear...
[3:08:34] <castlerock42> It's such a bad plan.
[3:08:43] <%Samex_Comex> If he's dead would his luck magic still work?
[3:08:48] <+Maleicus> yes
[3:08:50] <+polothegreatest> sleeper agent LUL
[3:08:53] <franctastic_> he's doing the "CLEARLY" face
[3:08:56] <+lordericter> not really
[3:09:20] <ZComiX> pretty standard for the amount of chips per calorie
[3:09:32] <+lordericter> normally like 13 chips is 150 cal
[3:10:07] <Spiggerus> weeb stuff is crazy badly written
[3:10:08] <SuperVaderMan> "our hopes will shine even brighter by overcoming that despair" yes this is a sentence a human would say
[3:10:17] <TheLemuroid> Nah this gets resolved IIRC
[3:10:20] <TheAntiNihilist> FINALE
[3:10:21] <%Samex_Comex> The trail of trials
[3:10:29] <franctastic_> H O P E > DeEZPeAr Kreygasm
[3:10:49] <%Heart0fInk> You look like you got something to say! Doooo You!?
[3:11:08] <+slothermun27> I see. Nagito is in fact just an idiot
[3:11:17] <TheLemuroid> He's relying on his luck to make the traitor the killer even without knowing who it is
[3:12:08] <franctastic_> here we go
[3:12:14] <LunarRemix> Oh no gamer girl is the traitor
[3:12:47] <+slothermun27> the origami killer is the traitor
[3:12:53] <TheLemuroid> It's also called the Future Foundation
[3:12:58] <+polothegreatest> LUL
[3:12:59] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO

[3:13:34] <+GemeSvev> SAY WHY AGAIN
[3:13:35] <TheLemuroid> LUL
[3:13:41] <+GemeSvev> SAY WHY ONE MORE TIME

[3:14:42] <+polothegreatest> disspea,
[3:15:12] <LunarRemix> It's an okay twist. You're supposed to trust her thinking she's the Kirigiri of this game
[3:15:16] <JohnClaggart> you've been Tribbing us?!?
[3:15:17] <%lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes this kiiiinda makes sense. She was the one who was always investigating with you and was kinda your sidekick
[3:15:21] <TheAntiNihilist> HOOOOOOOOOPE CLIMAX
[3:15:29] <SuperVaderMan> this is very arbitrary
[3:15:35] <+Mekhet09> Oh you are going to get so mad when you find out what this thing is about.
[3:15:53] <TheLemuroid> She was just talking about how the traitor was "unable to reveal themselves" because that was "how they were created"
[3:15:53] <%lemoan> @LunarRemix Really. I guessed that early on. She's been to involved with the main character
[3:15:54] <franctastic_> LUL LUL
[3:16:20] <+Maleicus> its the most likely chance in the end
[3:17:02] <TheLemuroid> IF she has free will
[3:17:23] <+Maleicus> yeah why me
[3:17:40] <franctastic_> hajime....I NEED YOU TO SPELL IT
[3:17:57] <TheLemuroid> @franctastic_ LUL

[3:18:28] <%Explodincatz> can u SPELL Chikockey?!
[3:18:44] <+Mekhet09> Well I think you're going to hate this and like this at the same time.
[3:19:25] <LunarRemix> Is she trying to pull off a Byaku and make you figure out who the traitor is?

[3:23:19] <+GemeSvev> yeah it's a vortex of nonsense
[3:23:21] <+slothermun27> was the game making sense up until this point?
[3:23:23] <TheAntiNihilist> What feelings?
[3:23:29] <%Heart0fInk> Contempt.
[3:23:32] <Daxalog> You were at that point 6-7 cases ago
[3:23:37] <%lemoan> @slothermun27 pffft no
[3:23:44] <%Explodincatz> say she aint got no fingers
[3:23:49] <LunarRemix> They have cameras everywhere
[3:23:56] <franctastic_> PogChamp
[3:24:05] <+kewlmyc> Her handwriting is godawful
[3:24:50] <ZComiX> in context of the full story of lot of the cases make more  sense
[3:24:54] <%akumakid13> you have your cat bud light ready
[3:25:03] <ZComiX> but that doesn't excuse how convoluted the entire story is
[3:25:16] <+Maleicus> the only one
[3:25:24] <+Mekhet09> For monomi's sake.
[3:25:29] <cherrycottontail> gamer handwriting
[3:25:37] <franctastic_> i mean she does not have fingers so it must quite hard
[3:25:37] <%lemoan> because it's supposed to look like a kids handwriting to  be cute
[3:25:40] <%Explodincatz> gamers cant be writers
[3:25:45] <Dlent_> Monomi only accepts reports in the form of children’s drawings
[3:25:55] <+lordericter> this notebook is for gamers
[3:26:02] <TheLemuroid> No one said she was a good or effective spy
[3:26:09] <SuperVaderMan> So Chiaki made this notebook to seem like it belong to Monomi... why? Why did she make this notebook???

[3:27:56] <%Heart0fInk> well this game is stupid and it's late. i'm going to bed.
[3:28:16] <TheLemuroid> Well I guess you were right. It is like a mini trial after the trial.
[3:28:25] <ZComiX> I'd like to point out that I fell asleep for like an hour and we werestill talking about the suicide
[3:28:25] <%vehementvadr> @heart0fink goodnight!
[3:28:29] <+Mekhet09> Use her account.
[3:28:46] <%lemoan> @ZComiX these trials are like 3 hours long.

[3:32:12] <%Explodincatz> used all your cuts
[3:32:12] <%SoFarFetched> the controller is like "no Im done with this game"
[3:32:20] <comedeity> bottom left has the number of cuts you can do
[3:32:26] <ZComiX> I like the little touch that her argument is so flimsy that but a puzzle is a lot easier
[3:32:30] <comedeity> bottom right I mean
[3:32:34] <filthywanko> go twice one way and once in the opposite to save cuts
[3:32:37] <+Maleicus> cut better
[3:32:49] <%SoFarFetched> you have to wait until a good amount of the sentences are on screen yeah
[3:33:00] <comedeity> if you alternate the direction you cut, its stronger. like up and down

[3:38:53] <TheAntiNihilist> Kingdom is great
[3:38:55] <TheLemuroid> All the stuff about how TRUTH is scary
[3:39:02] <+Taglog7> I wanna see cool characters be emotional
[3:39:03] <%Scarnehu> dangen ropa is j-slock
[3:39:09] <+Scevda> I wish localization was taken more seriously.  Not only does it maintain meandering, it maintains things  that are better left off the translation.
[3:39:26] <filthywanko> You weird me out for making it a japanese thing instead of, like, a shonen thing or something.
[3:39:37] <+CalderGaming> @lordericter nomura?
[3:39:40] <+bassoontyphoon> Brrrraaaaapppp
[3:39:45] <+GemeSvev> head empty, colon pouring
[3:39:54] <cherrycottontail> but it's a weeb game and weeb games have "must not change game at all in translation" fans
[3:39:57] <%lemoan> @filthywanko that's...still japanese.

[3:40:37] <cherrycottontail> bs are the worst
[3:40:39] <TheLemuroid> The question is how much JP writing with these tropes exist outside of shounen
[3:40:41] <cherrycottontail> they are basically a nothing
[3:40:42] <%akumakid13> deleting the T.A.S bot
[3:40:44] <+Mekhet09> You can.
[3:40:46] <+Scevda> holy fuck thats  a b????
[3:40:48] <+CalderGaming> @lordericter okay so you meant it captures the same problems as kingdom hearts despite not being written by nomura
[3:40:53] <%lemoan> @shinblarpus about a year. he uses the model on and off

[3:41:21] <+lordericter> @lordericter yes the same tropes and problems
[3:41:27] <+CalderGaming> ok
[3:41:30] <Tiny_Axolotl> your choices matter/s
[3:41:32] <+polothegreatest> wiggle your finger
[3:41:38] <%Scarnehu> @morcego_cinzento_arts yeah, but yakuza is so zany and goofyit gets away with a lot more
[3:41:51] <+bassoontyphoon> Rip to Gamer grill
[3:41:55] <+Polonsam> are you going to play the third game?
[3:41:58] <TheLemuroid> It would be really funny if Chiaki wasn't the killer because luck
[3:42:01] <+CalderGaming> who said they were a traitor, originally?
[3:42:10] <LunarRemix> Watch there be a twist where the Future Foundation is evil
[3:42:28] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah, so what was Chiaki doing that was so bad that Nagito wanted to reveal and kill her
[3:42:33] <%Murphio_GS> maybe they're trying to convey the idea of a spy instead of a "traitor" in that case
[3:43:00] <TheLemuroid> @CalderGaming The logic is backwards from what you would expect. They reasoned she was the traitor because Nagito wanted the traitor to randomly become the killer
[3:43:04] <+CalderGaming> i mean they introduced weird robots with Gotta Shit Student earlier
[3:43:08] <+Mekhet09> Yes. That is true.
[3:43:15] <shinblarpus> Oh it’s even worse than her being a robot just wait
[3:43:32] <+CalderGaming> @CalderGaming no i meant who mentioned the existence of a traitor earlier in the game, i don't remember
[3:43:36] <+Mekhet09> Yeah. It makes sense but it's stupid.
[3:43:41] <%lemoan> @CalderGaming nah man robots been around since first game. fighting helicopters and shit
[3:43:45] <+Scevda> EGGS
[3:43:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @scarnehu in the sidequest story world Yes. main quest storyline Yakuza is straight up overly sérios crime drama soap opera
[3:44:01] <+bassoontyphoon> B A R R E N
[3:44:16] <+Sharpie_Line> I just got a notification, I hate twitch.
[3:44:21] <%HawkGoggles2> Chiaki: See you again
[3:44:22] <LunarRemix> It would explain why her expressions are so deadpan
[3:44:27] <+GemeSvev> Chiaki will be backi
[3:44:31] <LunarRemix> She's not nearly as expressive as the rest of the cast
[3:44:45] <%Samex_Comex> Only 2 wives left
[3:45:03] <%lemoan> @LunarRemix i feel like japan likes to do that alot with emotionless charcaters. They just robot. no other reason
[3:45:05] <+lordericter> Sonya will return in the sequel, as Fat Sonya, as is tradition
[3:45:23] <LunarRemix> @lemoan You are right but it would make sense if she was an actual robot for once.
[3:45:24] <+CalderGaming> oh right
[3:45:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Doom 2016 had the balls to reference Terminator 2 thumbs up
[3:45:54] <TheLemuroid> Why do you think I am here?
[3:46:06] <%Explodincatz> many in chat are here for that reason
[3:46:09] <%HawkGoggles2> What!!?? Double, Double cross?? Now way, totally poggers, bro, says 12 year let's player
[3:46:12] <SuperVaderMan> I too want my confusion and frustrations to be validated
[3:46:12] <TheLemuroid> Most of us are probably here for that reason
[3:46:14] <%Murphio_GS> "fuck you, fuck monokuma, fuck this game, fuck this!" *turns off let'splay
[3:46:15] <+lordericter> yes
[3:46:17] <+CalderGaming> eli what if you watched someone else play through and just accept it uncritically, wouldn't that suck
[3:46:17] <+DangerSloth87> Pretty much
[3:46:19] <franctastic_> oh just you wait the next revelations LUL

[3:51:39] <ZaerichAnakalypton> A novemdecillion of Monokuma
[3:51:42] <omenesia> I am a plushie and I cannot Monkmuma?
[3:51:46] <+Scevda> @lemoan no lol enjoy this japanese humor
[3:51:48] <+Mekhet09> Uh. There's an explanation but you won't like it.
[3:51:58] <+CalderGaming> @PlagueOfGripes there are only approximately 10^54 atoms in the entire earth, to give you a sense of how little sense that makes

[4:01:15] <+polothegreatest> roboto
[4:01:30] <+CalderGaming> @Tiny_Axolotl because it's been within the rules to kill monomi whenever, monokuma just got bored of tolerating her
[4:02:05] <+polothegreatest> tetris
[4:02:09] <%Explodincatz> haha she died
[4:02:13] <+Scevda> LINE PIECE

[4:02:57] <theanora1> kinda sucks that you can't just stop playing games you don't like, as a streamer
[4:03:18] <Dlent_> Makes sense to me.
[4:03:56] <%Scarnehu> what about Data? would he be a killer?

[4:07:03] <TheLemuroid> Okay Arin
[4:07:43] <+bassoontyphoon> This writing is about as moving as Imodium

[4:08:24] <%Explodincatz> I VA like a madlad when I start losing my mind as well
[4:08:39] <%lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes So apparently fans of this game series say that was one of the best trials. You thoughts?
[4:09:07] <TheLemuroid> They like the twists
[4:09:10] <Dlent_> It had the most shenanigans, so it was the best :)
[4:09:12] <+Scevda> Good idea, absolute shit execution
[4:09:19] <%Samex_Comex> I liked it because Nagito was dead
[4:09:33] <+Mekhet09> Wow.
[4:09:35] <+Mekhet09> Rude.
[4:09:52] <%Scarnehu> @mekhet09 but fair
[4:10:08] <+CalderGaming> i dunno katamari is pretty cathartic
[4:10:09] <+Scevda> Some people have formative experiences with fucking undertale
[4:10:14] <+Scevda> Were fucked in any way
[4:10:21] <%Explodincatz> to survive school I would guess
[4:10:35] <+bassoontyphoon> Something something despair
[4:10:47] <franctastic_> PogChamp
[4:11:02] <%Samex_Comex> Robot wife!?
[4:11:03] <%lemoan> @Scevda i mean undertale is at least fun/entertaining. not this shit
[4:11:28] <+slothermun27> LuvOops LuvOops
[4:11:33] <+Scevda> @lemoan we both know that the "formative" part is not going to be its game play...

[4:13:25] <omenesia> Would Akane bear more kids than Aoi? CarlSmile
[4:13:33] <%lemoan> WAIT ARE THE OTHER WIVES ALIVE!?
[4:14:11] <TheLemuroid> @lemoan The same people that call Gundam or Nagito their fav character. I know people like that.
[4:14:27] <+Mekhet09> Maybe you are. Maybe. There will be an AI of a certain someone.
[4:15:00] <Dlent_> There’s no way to enjoy this game if you don’t like Nagito, tbh.
[4:15:05] <+slothermun27> almightyFace
[4:15:09] <%lemoan> @TheLemuroid yeah I feel like those are the only people that actually unironically like these games and think they're well written.
[4:15:12] <ZComiX> As little v once said: That’s an interesting theory.
[4:15:31] <+lordericter> nice
[4:15:41] <SuperVaderMan> So btw, if Nagito's plan failed, that means the whole class believing in his ultimate luck to find Chiaki guilty? Complete bullshit, but more-so
[4:16:49] <+CalderGaming> junko
[4:16:49] <+Mekhet09> JUNKO ENOSHIMA.
[4:16:49] <+SkyZanon> Junko
[4:17:33] <%Samex_Comex> I hope the password is password
[4:17:33] <TheLemuroid> @SuperVaderMan It kind of explains the convoluted suicide if he didn't want them to figure out it was Chiaki.
[4:18:06] <BigBanterCorbin> 11037
[4:18:12] <%lemoan> 11037
[4:18:14] <BigBanterCorbin> wait.....

[4:20:26] <omenesia> It's computer dandruff
[4:20:29] <Dlent_> Better to live in a simulation than a society KevinTurtle
[4:20:47] <Julkson> @lemoan so no one is actually dead?
[4:21:06] <%lemoan> @Julkson no we are CURRENTLY in a simulation.
[4:21:21] <+Mekhet09> I was pissed off about the first two trials because we didn't get anything.

[4:32:06] <%HawkGoggles2> Jencos
[4:32:06] <Carnadan> wait. this fella has a corpse hand taped on?
[4:32:09] <+Mekhet09> Yes.
[4:32:24] <+CalderGaming> @SuperVaderMan it's that he taped junko's forearm in place of his own
[4:32:25] <+GemeSvev> isthis a revolver ocelot/ liquid thing?
[4:32:42] <ZComiX> Bit Plauge! How would we know it’s a WOMANS hand???
[4:32:47] <SuperVaderMan> oh and the arm just works because danganronpa? ok
[4:33:04] <zhenthrim213> @SuperVaderMan it actullay doesnt
[4:33:04] <+CalderGaming> @SuperVaderMan he said it DIDN'T work, but somehow it hasn't rotted either
[4:33:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:33:26] <SuperVaderMan> I'm glad other people are paying attention, I've kinda checked out
[4:33:36] <+ToeBeanHeaven> PLague AM Sleepy
[4:33:43] <+ToeBeanHeaven> What a BABY
[4:33:44] <+CalderGaming> A Violin
[4:34:01] <+Scevda> This fucker thinks hes writing Evangelion.
[4:34:07] <%lemoan> @SuperVaderMan nah I think everyones else clocked out to. now it's just people who have already played the game
[4:34:30] <vindibeard> right for me at least lemoan
[4:34:40] <+CalderGaming> same
[4:35:00] <+GemeSvev> @lemoan I haven't played it. Watched the anime of the first though. Was strongly considering playing 2 and 3 'till I saw this.
[4:35:16] <+ToeBeanHeaven> That's the same VA as Cicero, isn't it?
[4:35:38] <%Explodincatz> always save
[4:35:51] <+bassoontyphoon> Yes save
[4:36:06] <%lemoan> @GemeSvev same difference I guess. I don't think anyone who hasn't played/seen this is keeping track
[4:36:42] <%theloganbrand> what about noctunral emmisons
[4:38:14] <+Scevda> Convolution is fuck easy
[4:38:26] <%HawkGoggles2> No, but they guessed the ending, Can't have that, have to throw everything in the trash now
[4:38:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> at this point i believe that Dangaronpa is just  like Overwatch and League of Legends. As in theirr online real value  is providing character design for pin up artists
[4:38:54] <+CalderGaming> unless it's the first thing your audience reads while they're at their most impressionable age range, then convoluted stuff is all they want. like homestuck.
[4:39:39] <+CalderGaming> so like I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream?
[4:41:29] <+Scevda> @morcego_cinzento_arts just aboit
[4:43:18] <%Explodincatz> nah man gotta drag it out
[4:43:26] <+CalderGaming> fRoM tHe TwIsTeD MiNd Of KaZuTaKa KoDakA
[4:43:27] <SuperVaderMan> It's generally a bad idea to wait for the characters to catch up to the reader
[4:43:53] <%Explodincatz> dangin drags EVERYTHING out
[4:44:08] <+CalderGaming> this kid LOVES naruto
[4:45:21] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Plague's idea of the sequel beings hundreds of years in the future. world itbe a futura were there is no humanamente and all it's left is AI stock in a sim?
[4:45:28] <%HawkGoggles2> So just us
[4:45:37] <wolfen091> and then they were in the mafia
[4:45:40] <+GemeSvev> Akane can be useful, just not for the trials :3
[4:45:54] <+CalderGaming> sonia has like... some encyclopedia knowledge or something
[4:46:04] <+CalderGaming> and political knowledge
[4:46:22] <%cosmicleviathan18> the game is still going
[4:46:40] <%lemoan> @PlagueOfGripes Akane seems a genuinely  good hearted person in this game. She just like to wrestle people.
[4:46:50] <%cosmicleviathan18> what happened to grey haired hand guy?
[4:47:02] <+CalderGaming> @cosmicleviathan18 he died in the last chapter
[4:47:13] <%lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 oh he dead. That was the last trial
[4:47:14] <omenesia> He did a heroic murder
[4:47:21] <%cosmicleviathan18> @caldergaming oh thank goodness
[4:47:37] <%lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 he killed himself to reveal the traitor
[4:48:04] <%cosmicleviathan18> who was the traitor
[4:48:14] <%lemoan> @cosmicleviathan18 gamer girl chiaki
[4:48:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> is it Just me or is Akane a Lil thicker in the hips and thighs compared to  the other Girls?
[4:48:26] <%cosmicleviathan18> rip
