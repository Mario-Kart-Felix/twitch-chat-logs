[0:04:10] <kerotuyu> Haven't tried railjack, since my friends haven't been on to play it. Any tips?
[0:04:16] <redrix_3> oh damn warframe
[0:05:18] <redrix_3> !uptime
[0:05:19] <@Nightbot> 5 minutes 27 seconds
[0:05:23] <redrix_3> ah
[0:05:44] <Skrakar> Because Railjack is currently a buggy mess.
[0:05:55] <redrix_3> i do love warframe the buggy mess that it is
[0:08:40] <+AnarchyAtlas> @PlagueOfGripes whats popping my dude
[0:08:55] <Deathsaw> thoughts on NSFW twitter ban on jan 1st?
[0:08:57] <redrix_3> de has never released a buggy update
[0:09:34] <Skrakar> I see that you are a man of culture, playing the muscleframe.
[0:10:45] <%Samex_Comex> What is that creature
[0:10:54] <+AMadHollow> nicenicenicenicenicenice
[0:11:30] <+LeStripp> Danke f√ºr Haha2020 @AnAnonymousCheerer.
[0:11:47] <+humbelpie> @PlagueOfGripes I just got back from seeing the movie Cats, it is one of the best worst movies of 2019. At multiple points in the film patches of fur disappeared and reappeared multiple times in various scenes
[0:12:38] <hectoriglesiasbenavides> goodnight
[0:13:31] <redrix_3> playing as the muscular female i see hmmmm
[0:14:30] <redrix_3> i got back on recently and found that the itzal was nerfed hard
[0:14:46] <+generalve> the key bindings for pc are way to spread out
[0:15:23] <+Firemane1279> BIG numbers doodChamp
[0:15:53] <TheAsylumCat> oh he's talking about arch wings
[0:17:12] <redrix_3> cries in lunaro
[0:17:28] <redrix_3> the abandoned
[0:17:37] <Skrakar> I refuse to play Railjack until I stop seeing people crying about crashes after getting Reactor loots.
[0:17:38] <Essixian> What do you think of Cy? Personally, I love his VA and whoever wrote his lines did a good job.
[0:18:08] <+ShogunNoonto> wukong ?
[0:18:31] <+AMadHollow> @essixian I disagree on both. but havent launched my jack yet. its ready
[0:19:41] <TheAsylumCat> theater
[0:19:50] <Essixian> @AMadHollow One of his lines warning of boarders is "Optimists inbound."
[0:20:34] <+AMadHollow> @essixian so he has a good line. everything is cringe and he sounds like he was meant to have no personality.
[0:21:06] <Essixian> @AMadHollow Well, then we simply don't agree with each other. That's fine though. c:
[0:21:43] <+AMadHollow> meanwhile ordis is batshit, the covenant one is insane, and the eso one is an obsessed psychopath
[0:21:54] <mortelkilll> i still wouldnt play archwing for fun
[0:22:08] <mortelkilll> ground more fun
[0:22:43] <+AMadHollow> it would be way more cool if we had fighter jets instead of archwing
[0:23:04] <+Splatterfest> plague how is this game with your internet? It always runs like ass for network wise
[0:23:39] <+AMadHollow> I'm trying to remember what franchise it was that was fighter jets that turn into mechs.
[0:23:57] <Skrakar> The Paracesis one?
[0:24:02] <Laecerelius> Macross
[0:24:15] <mortelkilll> ive been playing this game for a few week but il lhave to be honest, grineer are kind of the only fun faction to fight
[0:24:23] <+kyh9> Is this New War shit?
[0:24:23] <mortelkilll> everyone else either really boring or really annoying
[0:25:00] <+AMadHollow> @mortelkilll the infested used to be the most fun before they fucked enemy scaling and numbers like 4 years ago
[0:25:04] <Essixian> @AMadHollow I've gotten the impression from Cy that he's basically got robot PTSD from the Old War. He feels guilty because his precepts forced him to let his crew, which he clearly cared a lot about, die in order to finish the mission. So he's super serious and focused because he doesn't want to get too close to his current crew, to avoid the pain of losing them again. But he can't help but let his sassy playful side through sometimes no matter how hard he tries. Hence "Optimists inbound" etc.
[0:25:13] <mortelkilll> infested are the boring ones now
[0:25:20] <mortelkilll> corpus are annoying
[0:25:24] <Essixian> Man, I love the Sentient ship aesthetic. It's so fucking weird.
[0:25:25] <mortelkilll> and god sentient are the worst
[0:25:31] <redrix_3> your operator looks nice
[0:25:38] <+kyh9> I'm just waiting for when they give more Archwing models and we get mroe ship models in general
[0:25:42] <mortelkilll> orokin are your usual reski nfaction exept they dotn even loo kgood
[0:25:45] <+kyh9> I'm a sucker for Corpus-aesthetic anything
[0:25:56] <+AMadHollow> @mortelkilll before they added the nullifiers corpus weren't annoying but also weren't fun imo
[0:25:58] <mortelkilll> also havign a reskin factio nreally suck when there only 3 real factions
[0:26:09] <mortelkilll> corpus just have annoying mobs
[0:26:14] <mortelkilll> nullifiers i dont mind
[0:26:32] <+AMadHollow> @essixian I understand that facet from finishing the railjack, but he is still really bland.
[0:26:35] <Essixian> I mean, it wouldn't have been wrong in this case.
[0:26:36] <mortelkilll> but the stupdi bipedal robots, the drones
[0:26:44] <mortelkilll> the shield droens are the worst
[0:27:00] <mortelkilll> nullifier you just shoot a bunch to break their shield and murder them, they are decently balanced
[0:27:16] <+AMadHollow> @essixian if he regains more of his personality and whatnot with more successes
[0:27:16] <Skrakar> How do you feel about the change of Ivara's design for her Prime?
[0:27:38] <mortelkilll> grineer are the most fun, probably because they are all very chonky units and are the msot straight forward
[0:27:51] <mortelkilll> nice easy headshots too
[0:28:01] <Essixian> They're sucking it in, actually.
[0:28:04] <kerotuyu> Mmm
[0:28:17] <mortelkilll> this seem liek an ok map
[0:28:20] <redrix_3> "anti-void juice"
[0:28:25] <+AMadHollow> @mortelkilll the drones are easy, the bubbles are annoying if you don't have a rapid fire weapon (ie shotguns, snipers, and pistols) or warframe abilities.
[0:28:29] <mortelkilll> nice mix of space and ship
[0:28:54] <mortelkilll> not sure ill go back to this game but i had soem fun with it
[0:29:07] <mortelkilll> big gripe is being restraiend to one weapon and one subweapon
[0:29:20] <mortelkilll> aka one actua lweapon and one garbage
[0:29:23] <kerotuyu> What'd you name your ship?
[0:29:26] <+AMadHollow> @mortelkilll its hard to really get into. there's like 4 years of content you have to swallow in a few months if youre going to
[0:29:42] <mortelkilll> i reached eris
[0:29:42] <redrix_3> i dont get why they made ivara a jellyfish
[0:29:47] <mortelkilll> i think im about done
[0:29:48] <SwagetronPrime> basingus
[0:29:52] <Essixian> @PlagueOfGripes As an artist, what do you think of the design of the Sentients? Both units and the ship/tileset.
[0:30:17] <mortelkilll> bosses have been consistantly annoying garbage
[0:30:22] <mortelkilll> exept tyl regor, hes cool
[0:30:30] <Andele1503> I mean, its damage and elements arent fucked up, its just that armor scaling calculation is fucked up
[0:30:45] <redrix_3> corrosive or slash for the procs
[0:30:52] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:30:52] <redrix_3> gets past armour
[0:31:09] <mortelkilll> yeah the mod system is a cool concept but its badly done
[0:31:14] <Essixian> Slash and toxic is still useful though, since it bypasses armor.
[0:31:21] <Essixian> *are
[0:31:27] <mortelkilll> mods should be all abotu making fu nand creative builds , its just not
[0:31:27] <Essixian> *they, geez
[0:31:35] <kerotuyu> I don't know, man. Slash and viral can hit hard with mean crits.
[0:31:52] <Andele1503> All procs except magnetic are useful (AND WHY ISNT MAGNETIC THE MAGNETIZE PROC VOID ELEMENT HAS?), issue is entirely on armor DR calc
[0:32:23] <JustSuperish> the host probably wants the arm cannon
[0:32:29] <mortelkilll> also the actually good story is super backloaded into the game
[0:32:42] <mortelkilll> and its like only 5 mission
[0:33:15] <mortelkilll> oh god i just reminded myself of corpus hacking
[0:33:18] <mortelkilll> i hate corpus hacking
[0:33:23] <Essixian> @Andele1503 There's an argument to be made that if you switched them, Void damage is rare enough that its new proc (shield reduction) would become far too uncommon for how useful it is against Corpus units.
[0:33:37] <+Splatterfest> IPS?
[0:33:53] <JustSuperish> impact puncture slash
[0:33:55] <kerotuyu> LUL
[0:33:59] <+Splatterfest> oh i see
[0:34:12] <redrix_3> no one uses impact
[0:34:15] <redrix_3> ever
[0:34:40] <+Splatterfest> impact knocksdown tho
[0:34:42] <mortelkilll> i just use whatever mods i have
[0:34:49] <mortelkilll> not far enough to meta thigns out
[0:34:59] <mortelkilll> beside ennemeis die quick enough for me
[0:35:20] <redrix_3> i havent played ember in a while heard they changed her again
[0:35:29] <redrix_3> is she any good yet?
[0:35:55] <kerotuyu> Ember's pretty rad. She can survive higher end content better.
[0:36:30] <kerotuyu> She also does armor strip now. So that helps.
[0:36:31] <redrix_3> good to hear
[0:36:43] <Andele1503> @Essixian issue is magnetic cant combine with anything for the shield reduction to be of use, just have voids proc be something like a %HP dot (since void energy destroys life unless you got orokin tech or are a kid which people forgot) or convert that hit to true damage. The mag bubble meanwhile, always helps because its enemy linked and small enough not to obstruct allies unlike mags actual magnetize with modding.
[0:37:15] <Essixian> The damage type and proc system is flawed, but I think that people tend to forget that not all procs were intended to be equal. There are problems with that approach, to be sure, but I've seen a lot of people seemingly argue from the assumption that all damage types should be equally balanced and usefu when that was clearly never DE's intention.
[0:37:24] <mortelkilll> game doesnt seem super fun like this
[0:37:27] <+Firemane1279> To repair a wreckage? Yea, its fucking garbage.
[0:37:32] <Essixian> *useful
[0:37:50] <mortelkilll> just ru nand jump super far, ocasionally hit and one shot an enemy while loot appear in your stuff
[0:38:23] <+Firemane1279> Best melee weapon, Archwing's Centaur Kappa
[0:38:45] <redrix_3> i wonder if the archwing changes had any affect on titania
[0:38:48] <Andele1503> Pretty sure Prisma Veritux is the best because its the one that doesnt have its lockon bugged
[0:38:50] <kerotuyu> I got the knux just in time, then. To be useless.
[0:38:57] <DreadnoughtII> can you use dex pixia in space?
[0:39:09] <Essixian> @Andele1503 I see your point. I have to nitpick though; IIRC there's not been any indication that Void energy is directly physically harmful to anything but Sentients, but that humans exposed to it for long enough will go insane.
[0:40:09] <Essixian> @Andele1503 Then again our Operator does void damage to everything... but that's a question of whether they're using raw void energy or somehow refining or channeling it into a form that can cause damage.
[0:40:16] <TheAsylumCat> I have a love hate relationship with this game, it's fun but I'm terrible and I burn out quick
[0:40:32] <Presence_Eternal> cheer 123
[0:40:35] <Presence_Eternal> ack
[0:40:44] <+Firemane1279> Yyyeeaaa... Animal Companions gets kind of dunked on due to the level of Veil Railjack missions...
[0:40:53] <mortelkilll> love/hate probably what most people have for warframe
[0:40:54] <$Presence_Eternal> cheer123
[0:41:00] <mortelkilll> its very fun, exept whe ntis terrible
[0:41:16] <mortelkilll> and it goes fro mone to the other really quick
[0:41:26] <+Cucamabungabu> Man I stopped playing warframe like a year ago. Just watching this is making me nauseous.
[0:41:35] <mortelkilll> seem like endgame is more of the bad stuff trough
[0:41:51] <Essixian> In any case, I think the damage and proc system is fine for the most part. The greater issue is the insane armor scaling at high levels, but with the kind of firepower available to players I'm not sure how else to make sure we don't just one-shot everything.
[0:41:59] <redrix_3> any primes ypu trying to get right now plague?
[0:42:37] <mortelkilll> the crap begginign weapons
[0:42:38] <kerotuyu> Braton?
[0:42:38] <Essixian> Braton MK-1.
[0:42:46] <+Nautilus_Bot> the braton
[0:42:46] <mortelkilll> early ennemeis do die quick
[0:43:26] <RobotInProgress> I mean, we can die
[0:43:26] <mortelkilll> part of the problem might be that its dumb to base an actio ngame on gear stats
[0:43:31] <RobotInProgress> thats something we can do
[0:43:55] <mortelkilll> it just turn it all into a grind where yo uare either too weak or too strong
[0:44:02] <Essixian> It's pretty obvious that Railjack could've used more time for QA and balancing. They probably wanted it out in time for christmas.
[0:44:09] <sasparillatango> costs need to be reworked to incentivize bothering with middle versions
[0:44:35] <redrix_3> this game is so damn big but my god is non of it polished
[0:44:44] <mortelkilll> its too big
[0:44:49] <TheAsylumCat> the grind is big. I remember looking at Octavia after doing the quest and saying nope to that
[0:45:10] <mortelkilll> the quest decent trough
[0:45:19] <mortelkilll> i like the "boss" even if its super gimicky
[0:45:26] <+Firemane1279> @essixian I think they wanted it out in time for the VGAs more than Christmas, since it released during the VGAs
[0:45:28] <sasparillatango> Mk 3 should be bonkers expensive, mk1 should be dirt cheap, mk 2 should be reasonably useful in veil while you farm
[0:45:37] <Essixian> @redrix_3 There's plenty of polish, really. The core gameplay loop is great. It's just that DE tends to fly by the seat of their pants when it comes to new content.
[0:45:43] <Skrakar> Don't you get dojo XP for researching it?
[0:45:44] <TheAsylumCat> the quest was fun, got me bobbing my head
[0:45:46] <redrix_3> can you get a stalker spawn on the railjack because that sounds cool
[0:45:52] <mortelkilll> its also that they leave old content in there
[0:45:55] <mortelkilll> and the old content bad
[0:46:16] <mortelkilll> and its all mandatory
[0:46:18] <sasparillatango> despite all of warframes issues, it's still an entertaining game
[0:46:19] <Andele1503> Im in general waiting for post new year for a proper dive into liches and railjack simply because bothering with 2 1/3rd done systems aint fun
[0:46:25] <mortelkilll> its still fu nyeah
[0:46:44] <mortelkilll> exept bosses
[0:47:03] <mortelkilll> god this game has bad bosses
[0:47:09] <sasparillatango> yeaaa... yea
[0:47:12] <Essixian> @mortelkilll That's the problem with a FTP game that relies on new content, I guess. You have to keep making new stuff to keep people interested, so if whatever you did before isn't great you may not have the time or resources to fix it.
[0:47:14] <sasparillatango> bosses are kinda nuts
[0:47:28] <mortelkilll> bosses are just awfully designed
[0:47:28] <sasparillatango> I don't know how you make a fun boss in WF with the massive power gap
[0:47:41] <mortelkilll> well fixing the power gap would be the first step
[0:47:49] <mortelkilll> then make them like tyl regor, no bullshit gimmick
[0:47:55] <mortelkilll> just let me shoot them
[0:48:00] <mortelkilll> and give the minteresting moves
[0:48:02] <sasparillatango> just like in the base game!
[0:48:24] <sasparillatango> ok, whats the best way to get asterite?
[0:48:26] <Andele1503> Best WF bosses are zealot, kela and tyl simply because it are the only bosses that respect the player (to a degree), raptors and hyena pack too if their non-sortie versions count
[0:48:27] <sasparillatango> cause I need so much
[0:48:28] <mortelkilll> heh, only a few boss didnt have a shit gimmick
[0:48:42] <sasparillatango> Lok Tar?
[0:48:42] <mortelkilll> vor not very fun but i guess hes not that bs
[0:48:52] <Andele1503> all of which would be mini bosses in games that actually put any design time for bosses
[0:48:53] <TheAsylumCat> yea had a boss the other day that would teleport every 2 seconds and I could not get a shot off
[0:48:59] <mortelkilll> the mars boss is ok because his gimmick is just to hit his back
[0:49:05] <+Cucamabungabu> @PlagueOfGripes Are you going to play another league botgame with your twitch viewers at some point in the future?
[0:49:14] <mortelkilll> its a decent gimmick and once you figure it out its a big enough hitbox
[0:49:20] <+Nautilus_Bot> can multiple people participate in constructing one part?
[0:49:32] <mortelkilll> the saturn boss is so obnoxious
[0:49:35] <sasparillatango> vidar has lots of avionics
[0:49:40] <Andele1503> Krill is meh because the "hit back" hitbox for melee is trash tho
[0:49:44] <mortelkilll> really specific hitboxes and they are only ope nhalf the time
[0:50:05] <sasparillatango> what weapons you runnin?
[0:50:16] <mortelkilll> krill not good but by warframe standarts hes on the upper tier
[0:50:20] <sasparillatango> weapons should be priority 1
[0:50:23] <Andele1503> true
[0:50:27] <sasparillatango> 2x Cryophons
[0:50:32] <mortelkilll> i like the earth boss as a character but god hes an awful boss
[0:50:40] <mortelkilll> agai nwith the god damn invincibility
[0:50:45] <mortelkilll> tiny hitbox thats closed half the time
[0:50:46] <sasparillatango> or amesha's 3
[0:50:57] <mortelkilll> i use a shotgun
[0:51:00] <sasparillatango> those are bad builds then
[0:51:03] <Andele1503> yus, ruk and vayhek have the massive issue of not just the shitty hitbox detection, but also constant wiggling AND THE DAMN GLOW SPAM
[0:51:04] <sasparillatango> you need to pump up the avionics
[0:51:09] <sasparillatango> hyperstrike
[0:51:14] <mortelkilll> oh yeah they also cosntantly move
[0:51:19] <sasparillatango> its like going into a sortie without serration
[0:51:24] <mortelkilll> its unreasonable hard to hit the weak spot
[0:51:30] <mortelkilll> krill at least would stay immobile after attacking
[0:51:36] <mortelkilll> and the back hitbox was pretty phat
[0:51:46] <mortelkilll> also it was half the fight, not the whoel thing
[0:51:52] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:52:01] <Henpemaz> extremely danger
[0:52:14] <mortelkilll> i still dotn udnerstand how the jupiter boss work
[0:52:24] <mortelkilll> like there 2 ennemeis and they dotn die for some reason when they have no health
[0:52:36] <Andele1503> i mean, its not really unreasonable since you can full auto em to death, its just stupidly slapped together without anyone even thinking about it for more than 2 seconds/without any thought about game design
[0:52:44] <mortelkilll> hyena pack is a bunch of normal ennemies
[0:53:12] <mortelkilll> the eris boss whci his impossible to solo because he has to mind control someone to be vulnerable
[0:53:24] <Andele1503> jupiter/salad5 is kill dog, then kill man, because dog will heal man while man can revive dog
[0:53:33] <Andele1503> (dog protects and will heal*)
[0:53:38] <mortelkilll> the delerict boss which last way too freakin long and can only be hit in the mouth whic his once again closed half the time
[0:53:49] <mortelkilll> also first tijem i fought him i got timed out
[0:53:58] <mortelkilll> because ennemeis stopped spawning
[0:54:31] <mortelkilll> i have no idea how the 2nd jupiter boss work, he just seemed invincible
[0:54:43] <mortelkilll> and no actual weakspots
[0:54:46] <Andele1503> If you mean ropadopaloli
[0:54:59] <mortelkilll> ropalist thank
[0:55:04] <Andele1503> its dumb in terms of how it signals you what to do
[0:55:05] <mortelkilll> cant rememebr half those names
[0:55:15] <Andele1503> but its actually not even a boss, just a puzzle mission
[0:55:37] <mortelkilll> i liked the story bosses like stalker and grineer queen
[0:55:39] <Mrdragonmaker> 4 types including sigma
[0:56:03] <mortelkilll> kind of frustrating but they had nice buildup
[0:56:15] <Andele1503> jump behind tesla coil for lazor to charge>hit shield with potato kid/amp>jump on ropaloli>slam ropaloli into energized reactor>repeat 3 times and them hit button on middle platform
[0:56:30] <mortelkilll> i just want bosses i can shoot and dodge
[0:56:43] <mortelkilll> and that dont punish me for not having super accurate high dps weapons
[0:56:45] <Andele1503> i mean, its true that it shouldnt be called a boss
[0:56:51] <The_Bob_Guy> those icons next to the names are brands or manufacturers I think
[0:56:56] <Andele1503> but its at least ok designed
[0:57:13] <Andele1503> (even if it has no visual or audio indicators what to do)
[0:57:35] <mortelkilll> like i said, tyl regor the only boss i liked
[0:57:42] <mortelkilll> because hes the msot normal
[0:58:09] <Andele1503> Kela? Sedna boss?
[0:58:13] <Mrdragonmaker> Im used to the avi system, I enjoy the different build I can make at the moment.
[0:58:13] <mortelkilll> didnt fight her
[0:58:27] <mortelkilll> hopefully she is normal too
[0:58:32] <Andele1503> kinda normal
[0:58:36] <mortelkilll> good
[0:58:45] <mortelkilll> tyl regor also flood the arena, useless but cool
[0:58:49] <mortelkilll> and he spawn those ninjas
[0:58:52] <mikukojitsu> what game is this and why in the name of RA is it so god damn complicated?
[0:58:54] <mortelkilll> which is their first appearance
[0:59:07] <mortelkilll> hes not even that good ,hes just not bullshit
[0:59:15] <Andele1503> when she jumps away like regor, instead of killing manics you need to hit rotating buttons but those are easy/has a decent time
[0:59:20] <Andele1503> just do it solo instead of coop
[0:59:41] <mikukojitsu> this game looks so complicated..
[0:59:45] <Andele1503> because coop breaks kela into shit because people refuse to stand on button and shoot and it bugs her targetting
[0:59:49] <mortelkilll> oh i guess the venus boss is ok
[0:59:54] <+maimage00> tactical cs reduced is not for pilots really
[0:59:57] <+maimage00> cd
[1:00:03] <mortelkilll> its also a normal boss
[1:00:07] <mortelkilll> jaqual?
[1:00:36] <+maimage00> anyone can use the tactical avionics like as an Engi using Battle forges going from 8min cd to about 4min is really nice
[1:01:01] <Andele1503> jackal has the problem of sometimes the fight bugs out/gets stuck when on the ground invul and this hasnt been fixed for years because its hard to reproduce reliably
[1:01:18] <+maimage00> the front cannon is for Crewships
[1:01:31] <+maimage00> it can one shot them into saturn and even teh veil with some status n them
[1:01:31] <mortelkilll> i like fought him once and it was in a team
[1:01:39] <+maimage00> you really havent used it enough
[1:02:24] <mortelkilll> i have no idea what plague talking about and i dont think i want to know
[1:02:27] <mortelkilll> this seem really bad
[1:02:48] <mikukojitsu> ...and people play this for fun?
[1:03:04] <Andele1503> no, its a 1/3rd finished update
[1:03:06] <mortelkilll> this was like a 20 minute rant abotu how stupid railjack costumisation is
[1:03:53] <+ShogunNoonto> your about to see some odd shit
[1:04:00] <Mrdragonmaker> This is part of the quest to start up your railjack
[1:04:02] <mikukojitsu> good lord man
[1:04:35] <Andele1503> I did the exact same thing
[1:04:46] <mortelkilll> which warframe is it?
[1:04:57] <KisaSatoma> Hyldrin.
[1:05:11] <Andele1503> only coloured her to look like she has sports shirt and yoga pants
[1:05:28] <mikukojitsu> so.. whats the point of this game
[1:05:42] <mortelkilll> she doesnt look great
[1:05:59] <mortelkilll> the point is to try to keep the solar system mostly stable by killign a lot
[1:06:05] <kvassimoto> Palpatine was behind it all
[1:06:06] <mikukojitsu> ah
[1:06:08] <TG_Cid11> the movement in this game makes me a little motion sick
[1:06:11] <mortelkilll> and there a lot of peopel trying to fuck it up
[1:06:23] <mortelkilll> the big 3 are a dictature of military clones
[1:06:34] <mortelkilll> an evil corporatio nthat value money over human lives
[1:06:35] <mortelkilll> and zombies
[1:06:47] <mortelkilll> weirdly enough the second one is the creepiest to me
[1:07:04] <Andele1503> Nah thats perfectly natural
[1:07:06] <mortelkilll> oh also there livign machines that want to eradicate humanity
[1:07:20] <mikukojitsu> really? this game sounds like a cluster fuck of space theme
[1:07:27] <mortelkilll> and dead space elves that are obsessed with money and power and judge that everyoen else is worth nothing
[1:07:36] <mortelkilll> its pretty cluster fuck
[1:07:50] <mortelkilll> to be fair most of the lroe focus o na few major point
[1:07:59] <+Shaggnar> katieWtf
[1:08:06] <mortelkilll> like everyoen pretty much is related to the orikin (dead space elves) and follow their mentality
[1:08:16] <mortelkilll> mentality which is that money and power is all that matter
[1:08:26] <mortelkilll> so lets destroy the solar system to make money and pwoer
[1:08:38] <mikukojitsu> with how decked out ely is i assume this game goes the typical rpg MMO route?
[1:08:40] <mortelkilll> orokin are kidn of cool in how they creepily make sense
[1:08:47] <mortelkilll> yea hit does
[1:08:57] <Cowctus> What are your thoughts on the new melee anyways, plague?
[1:09:00] <XBLWRECKtos> Sometimes you need a large hammer in your life
[1:09:01] <mortelkilll> orokin are just really rich and really advanced so they do whatever they want
[1:09:03] <mikukojitsu> so this game is a time sink to get good
[1:09:07] <mortelkilll> and peopel treat them as gods for it
[1:09:22] <mortelkilll> and just now we are realising hwo shit they really were
[1:09:32] <mortelkilll> and are tryign to stop peopel fro mbeign like them by murdering a bunch
[1:09:33] <%StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[1:09:37] <Andele1503> kinda, the space elves wanted to be "pretty" and "unique", not power and money, its just that they happened to also be nepotistic megalomaniacs (mostly)
[1:09:55] <mortelkilll> i like that the orikins have very human flaws and arent just evil
[1:10:05] <mortelkilll> ironically turnign themselves extremely inhuman
[1:10:08] <alphonseisbest> @plagueofgripes Sidious was the site the whole time, even in the past... all sidious. -Woolie & pat 2019
[1:10:16] <alphonseisbest> the sith
[1:10:32] <alphonseisbest> All the sith hahahaha
[1:10:40] <mortelkilll> the corpus (evil corporation) are the msot human looking and ironically the most inhuman acting
[1:10:49] <mortelkilll> oh also the corpus are super religious
[1:10:55] <mortelkilll> but their religion is all about money
[1:10:56] <mikukojitsu> i keep hearing war hammer and not war frame and honestly.. would it be safe to assume the two act alike game playwise?
[1:11:11] <alphonseisbest> BTW how's warframe these days
[1:11:20] <mortelkilll> to be fair thats because the orokins were all abotu money and so the corpus followed i ntheir footsteps
[1:11:35] <%Samex_Comex> Ew
[1:11:40] <serpenttucker> Here come the cummies
[1:11:57] <mortelkilll> i liek the general theme of how fucked up peopel in power can influence other peopel to become fucked up
[1:12:05] <mortelkilll> as their way of life become the standart/ideal
[1:12:09] <+fingalights> Thanks for the HahaSleep @stridentsong
[1:12:16] <mortelkilll> and nwo the solar system is just fucked
[1:12:38] <mortelkilll> half the planets are torn appart for mining and military bases
[1:12:41] <mikukojitsu> oh no the player character was tricked into doing somthign they had no choice but to do or else not progres?
[1:12:51] <mortelkilll> or infested by space zombies released by the war
[1:13:04] <mortelkilll> who has fingers that big?
[1:13:10] <serpenttucker> You finger it?
[1:13:11] <mortelkilll> didnt hear about any giants
[1:13:18] <+philosopher721> wait no why is there a giant finger in the engine?
[1:13:32] <Lelfro> "Oh no, that's the wrong type of finger"
[1:13:34] <mortelkilll> there not even aliens in this game
[1:13:41] <mortelkilll> its all variatiosn of humans
[1:13:45] <Henpemaz> Hijacking a Railjack ?
[1:14:12] <+firmlygraspi1> theyre all Recoome's race
[1:14:47] <mortelkilll> kidna random
[1:15:14] <Mrdragonmaker> Base railjack was still do the easiest mission.
[1:15:46] <+Bane_Kaikyo> Yo Plague, I played some Railjack with you a few days ago, you were chill
[1:16:09] <mortelkilll> also, anyone else really hated the zealoid?
[1:16:12] <Mrdragonmaker> Me too, I need the Vidar reactor too
[1:16:18] <%Samex_Comex> Finger licking good?
[1:16:19] <mortelkilll> god those ruined quite a few missions for me
[1:17:06] <Mrdragonmaker> I got a 47 avi Zekti reactor though, manged to put all my health/amour mods and by base damage mods
[1:17:18] <+Bane_Kaikyo> You might not remember me but seeing you fill into my crew made my day
[1:17:47] <mortelkilll> its nice to have you play this game, i dont get many opportunities to just complain abotu everything that annoy me in this game
[1:18:51] <mortelkilll> weird
[1:18:56] <chowdah101> railjack can be pretty fun, when you arent patching up hull breaches every 10 seconds
[1:19:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Plague, tell me a story
[1:19:52] <Aussie_Manny> Once upon a time... in Hollywood...
[1:21:25] <serpenttucker> Boy this looks like a lot of stuff I won't do because of my crippling fear of fucking up in a team best friends
[1:21:29] <aeonicvector> Its both
[1:21:33] <mortelkilll> who knows
[1:21:40] <mortelkilll> probly both
[1:21:52] <mortelkilll> a lot of players probably give up before endgame
[1:21:58] <+QuasartheHero> HahaGingercat
[1:22:09] <aeonicvector> How can Plague real if warframe isnt startrek
[1:22:20] <mortelkilll> yeah i get it
[1:22:27] <serpenttucker> "You the guy who does the sexy rogue on imageboard!?" PogChamp
[1:22:33] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> wait, plague is a reak guy?
[1:22:35] <mortelkilll> dont want to bother with fans whe nyou re relaxing trough farm
[1:23:40] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months, currently on a 11 month streak! 
[1:23:43] <mortelkilll> if i ever meet you i nwarframe, ill make sure not to talk to you vodgobHappy_SG
[1:23:43] <+ShogunNoonto> you said owl but that sound like cat
[1:23:50] <chowdah101> riooUm
[1:23:53] <+QuasartheHero> bitterScree
[1:23:54] <Mrdragonmaker> oof that bug
[1:23:55] <aeonicvector> Thanks for the HahaThink @jjcheeker
[1:23:58] <cap_bon> so is archwing a big part of the latest update?
[1:24:01] <Mrdragonmaker> Time to restart
[1:24:07] <mortelkilll> seem to be
[1:24:09] <%JJCheeker> o/
[1:24:24] <Cowctus> wait there is a resource that's just called Titanium?
[1:24:30] <Cowctus> That is the most normal resource name in the entire game
[1:24:31] <Mrdragonmaker> That happens when you stay in the crewship once the mission ends
[1:24:42] <mortelkilll> lets be honest the ressoruces have really dumb names
[1:24:56] <+Bane_Kaikyo> I think when you matched into my crew, I kept it a little casual.... We and a very eager rookie in the squad and you and I took turns answering questions
[1:25:00] <mortelkilll> most of the tiem they are just normal ressoruce wit haltered names to sound fancier
[1:25:04] <+eldritchmouse> Railjank
[1:25:12] <+Shaggnar> Francis Bacon is great
[1:25:32] <Mrdragonmaker> Should of released last the holidays, imo
[1:25:57] <+Shaggnar> My favorite one is the dude with the umbrella and half a face
[1:26:14] <mortelkilll> no this isnt iron, this is ferrite , totally different Kappa
[1:27:08] <Slim_Lipid> That slit won't accept your goo
[1:27:09] <Mrdragonmaker> You have to get the host to fix them
[1:27:10] <Henpemaz> It bugs you
[1:27:13] <cap_bon> Audacity DansGame
[1:27:58] <+eldritchmouse> I thought they raised it
[1:28:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE
[1:28:01] <+QuasartheHero> bitterBrain
[1:28:04] <+Firemane1279> LUL
[1:28:08] <chowdah101> elytrons abilities need to come in contact with an enemy to go off which sucks since the fighters are so fast
[1:28:19] <Mrdragonmaker> I though they raised it too
[1:28:27] <cap_bon> wtf are all these new bullshit resources
[1:28:54] <+Caidezes> I do believe they raised it, yes.
[1:29:48] <suikudo> BDO....
[1:30:47] <mikukojitsu> kingdom hearts does it okay with their item draw thing
[1:30:51] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:31:02] <suikudo> In black desert you have to manually pick everything up unless you spend money on a pet
[1:31:10] <Laecerelius> You don't understand, Plague, you HAVE to waste a slot on your pet for picking shit up
[1:31:30] <chowdah101> tera online has that as well.
[1:31:33] <cap_bon> instead they gave that dumb looking vacum potato
[1:31:40] <eboera> eboera subscribed at Tier 1. 
[1:32:40] <ScreamLord> Warframe is the worst-best Free-to-Play game
[1:33:41] <ScreamLord> "I hacked into the Government." Plague 2019
[1:33:53] <tanarath> Carrier can suck up stuff 'nearby' with one mod and detect enemies & items with another mod.
[1:33:55] <smile64> i thought only japanese high schoolers could hack the government
[1:33:55] <%eboera> Howdy Plague, I've interacted with you several times in other streams, happy to finally catch one of yours and sub
[1:34:12] <tanarath> no need to use frame mod slots
[1:34:15] <Laecerelius> All pets can have vaccuum now
[1:34:52] <cap_bon> So then why the fuck do you not automatically vacuum loot why have the upgrade at all arghh
[1:34:54] <%JJCheeker> yo eboera bitterAyy
[1:35:05] <Laecerelius> We don't know
[1:35:25] <Laecerelius> I guess they figured that freeing up a mod space on pets would make them not quite as useless?
[1:35:42] <%eboera> @JJCheeker ayyy friend
[1:35:53] <ScreamLord> So is Archwing good now or is it still garbage?
[1:36:13] <+Caidezes> Amesha's good.
[1:36:23] <+QuasartheHero> honestly i wish that the open worlds/this wasn't so minecraft-y
[1:36:23] <Laecerelius> I'm assuming the main reasons why they didn't get rid of base damage mods like they talked about for a bit is because they realized that people would use that freed up spot for even MORE damage
[1:36:41] <tanarath> correct
[1:36:49] <%JJCheeker> how it be eb
[1:36:57] <cap_bon> Number must get B I G G E R
[1:37:06] <+QuasartheHero> bitterShrug
[1:37:08] <tanarath> because more damage solves problems
[1:37:13] <+eldritchmouse> The enemy scaling in railjack gets silly.
[1:37:20] <+Bane_Kaikyo> imo, 800 is maybe the highball... 300 is hella reasonable tho
[1:37:27] <chowdah101> they have way more health than usual
[1:37:53] <+QuasartheHero> is a slash/viral builds still dumb strong?
[1:38:10] <tanarath> yes
[1:38:14] <+QuasartheHero> sick
[1:38:21] <Andele1503> I mean, fragor prime in base game barely kills level 100 heavies (vs forced slash heavies with same setup) , so for railjack enemies which at level 20 have the stats of level GOD DAMN 80, which means at railjack level 80 they have OVER LEVEL 450!
[1:38:22] <Laecerelius> people are all about corrosive/heat now since they changed heat to halve enemy armor
[1:38:50] <%eboera> @JJCheeker I be ok, doing card game shit
[1:38:56] <+QuasartheHero> what does viral do now?
[1:39:00] <Laecerelius> same thing
[1:39:01] <%JJCheeker> Nice
[1:39:06] <redrix_3> large plague energy
[1:39:10] <Laecerelius> they changed heat to make ember less useless
[1:39:10] <ScreamLord> "Overpowered" is better than Underpowered when it comes to player options
[1:39:34] <tanarath> ^
[1:39:45] <TheAsylumCat> ^
[1:40:35] <Mrdragonmaker> DE want to buff things more then nerf things, they don't want another chroma situation.
[1:41:02] <cap_bon> chroma being released near the same time as a credit boost event LUL
[1:41:18] <redrix_3> i think plague would like doom
[1:41:23] <+QuasartheHero> and man the grind for a dojo as a solo player is a nightmare
[1:42:11] <mikukojitsu> spaaace eellg
[1:42:12] <Henpemaz> top right is thicc
[1:42:13] <+Shaggnar> I mean they're on the hat
[1:42:14] <mikukojitsu> elf
[1:42:29] <redrix_3> octavia best
[1:42:41] <%JJCheeker> Meow meow
[1:42:54] <Mrdragonmaker> The only thing to got left is to farm parts better parts with good rng stats now, So I guess I still got some more content to still do xD
[1:43:30] <+QuasartheHero> hard core minecraft and nobody really wants to invite new players into clans
[1:44:04] <Mrdragonmaker> press tab and check the stats and the rng stat
[1:44:07] <aeonicvector> delay on crafting weapons unless they look ASSUREDLY better, canceling/refunding is on their to do docket
[1:44:09] <TheAsylumCat> I worry my antisocial ass is mooching off the clan I'm in
[1:44:14] <ScreamLord> Get into a big active Clan or do nothing loosers
[1:44:31] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[1:44:46] <cap_bon> Jesus the amount of new resources
[1:44:50] <chowdah101> its almost nudging you to but those rush repair drone things
[1:44:56] <Mrdragonmaker> I would not recommend Zekti most of the time. Heat up is just too much even with heat up avis
[1:44:57] <chowdah101> buy*
[1:45:19] <+eldritchmouse> I think they said they were going to address the repair costs after the holiday break.
[1:45:22] <Mrdragonmaker> Weapon stats are way less random
[1:45:26] <ScreamLord> I'm STILL trying to get all the resources I need to build Vauban Prime and I've had all his blueprints for months
[1:45:37] <Mrdragonmaker> Weapons only have one random stat
[1:45:50] <redrix_3> have as many variables as possible to extend play time
[1:46:05] <+eanscrale> I usually just give up.
[1:46:12] <cap_bon> Is energizing dash still the only useful focus
[1:47:13] <Mrdragonmaker> My railjack has over 800 flux lmao, only 78 avi points (47 reactor).
[1:47:16] <mortelkilll> so mods?
[1:47:40] <Mrdragonmaker> only have room for one battle avi, at least I can use it alot.
[1:48:13] <redrix_3> man furiously shits all over rng
[1:49:03] <Mrdragonmaker> You can scrap the old parts to get most your resources back.
[1:49:07] <redrix_3> that would certainly make trade chat aids
[1:49:17] <+alpharius88> kuva weapons are like that
[1:49:25] <+alpharius88> a little
[1:49:32] <+eanscrale> Yeah this update definitely felt like it needed more time in the oven
[1:50:03] <Teyaric> So, don't play warframe for 6 months is what I'm hearing.
[1:50:28] <tanarath> space shooty ship new
[1:50:32] <+imadoc91> They do, and then they just like keep throwing layers of duct tape over it
[1:50:55] <tanarath> very expensive, grindy, fun though
[1:50:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:51:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think they just wanted to get it out already so they could try to change it afterwards based on how it works out
[1:51:13] <+imadoc91> What is this shit, this the new update?
[1:51:15] <cap_bon> lets jsut add entire new systems and resources every update
[1:51:19] <TheAsylumCat> if this game wasn't free to play...
[1:52:04] <+imadoc91> It's astounding how different this game looks from the last time I played even though I played when fortuna dropped.
[1:52:17] <tanarath> that's never a bad idea, but you've gotta know how to do it
[1:52:26] <redrix_3> this sounds like plague has a great opinion on rivens
[1:52:35] <+ShogunNoonto> i thought they where trying to slowy make this an open world game
[1:53:12] <Gaz_TTV> whatsup guys first time checking out the stream
[1:53:23] <Gaz_TTV> seems like a good convo going on
[1:53:35] <cap_bon> So is this update a pass if your a solo clanner ?
[1:53:40] <+Shoosler> :)
[1:53:47] <ScreamLord> Children tend to have small hands
[1:53:50] <+imadoc91> So the same problems as most other aspects of the game. Most effective strat is to pick an OP frame, break its abilities with mods and then play dynasty warriors with all the enemies?
[1:53:51] <Gaz_TTV> and you lost me lmao
[1:54:02] <redrix_3> nothin personell kid!
[1:54:05] <+ShogunNoonto> what?
[1:54:06] <Mrdragonmaker> Vidar mk3 apocs are pretty good. Phasors are good for breaking the regen bubbles the crewships spam
[1:54:52] <tanarath> @imadoc91 or get zaws/kitguns
[1:55:08] <cap_bon> stack modifiers on 1 thing and maximize it to the moon
[1:55:09] <+ShogunNoonto> brachy1Brabuns
[1:55:25] <+sourceofall> do the drops go up further in? because god damn gathering literraly thousands of components per piece is obnoxious
[1:55:47] <chowdah101> the hard part os getting your railjack properly customized
[1:55:52] <+imadoc91> Game never stops being grindy source
[1:55:55] <redrix_3> i kinda just carpet bomb hordes of ads with a sleep equinox
[1:56:52] <+Firemane1279> To also be fair, Repair Maids get A LOT of XP.
[1:57:43] <tanarath> maybe they could scale resource use exponentially, so powerful players have to pay a chunk, but new people don't pay that much
[1:58:32] <Mrdragonmaker> They can, the Zekti cryo can one shot with the right avis
[1:58:50] <cap_bon> It feels like a really common theme were game designers expect players to take balanced approach to things instead of just stacking modifiers on one thing to min max
[1:58:59] <xeros720> still can't figure out how to not die as a newish payer too
[1:59:10] <Mrdragonmaker> Vidar Apoc is great
[1:59:44] <suikudo> Dynasty warriors on harder difficulties officers and elite units are a big problem
[2:00:13] <redrix_3> nah those nullifiers are kinda require strategy
[2:00:23] <+RealPT1> but the tactics in those games are just finding ways to cheese the game, not master any kind of mechanic or hope you were set up to make it easier
[2:00:27] <chowdah101> everything's fine until a grineer nox covers you in sticky white stuff and you die
[2:00:32] <+imadoc91> I thought everyone ran corrosive because Saryn has an S Rank Ass.
[2:01:08] <cap_bon> to be fair that unique saryn skin with the flower is fucking awesome
[2:01:14] <+eldritchmouse> Viral is good if you're using slash IPS
[2:01:38] <xeros720> offhand, i remember that if you look at all the damage types, corrosive is neutral at worst to everything
[2:01:55] <Masterchiefaron> Hello hello @plagueofgripes
[2:02:16] <Teyaric> Nothing is going on - Use corrosive, crit, or slash. Rads for eids, that's the end of the discussion. They're all viable.
[2:02:19] <cap_bon> I normally just spam Trinity's energy vampire ability since it has no element and ignores armour
[2:02:31] <xeros720> although, thanks for letting me know everyone just runs corrosive, drove myself nuts for a while making race specific mod loadouts
[2:02:39] <tanarath> there are videos that explain in 20 minutes
[2:03:03] <tanarath> But it sucks that 3rd parties have to explain that
[2:03:04] <+imadoc91> I should probably get back into Warframe, but I'm in that awkward boring part where you have finished the star chart but you're kind of still too weak for the end game stuff.
[2:03:08] <Teyaric> 90% more bullet PER bullet!
[2:03:09] <Mrdragonmaker> Its fun to teach people how gas procs can benefit from stealth multipliers twice.
[2:03:16] <SivSarcast> Is Damage Meta still a thing?
[2:03:23] <$Masterchiefaron> Cheer1
[2:03:43] <$Rivalshotzgp> Cheer1
[2:03:48] <cap_bon> when is big number ever not the meta
[2:04:07] <Masterchiefaron> Cheer100 Cheer100
[2:04:07] <+imadoc91> I thought warframe's entire design philosophy was damage
[2:04:21] <+imadoc91> and fuck anything that isn't damage
[2:04:33] <Rivalshotzgp> I saved up like 5 from doing ads on mobile
[2:04:43] <cap_bon> god I cant imagine starting the game new nowadays and not having the element/status mods
[2:04:45] <suikudo> Its an ongoing war between people who are for raw damage or status
[2:05:11] <Teyaric> Impact is what generates hitstun - Slash generates extra damage. We don't bother with Puncture.
[2:05:16] <redrix_3> i, a hybrid build chad, stand above you fools
[2:05:31] <+Caidezes> Crit versus status is dumb. Just go for both.
[2:05:35] <xeros720> oh, had no idea impact had hitstun attached to it
[2:05:36] <Rivalshotzgp> I love how the sniper archgun has absolutely TRASH range due to bullet velocity
[2:05:50] <cap_bon> red crits HahaThisisfine
[2:06:19] <sasparillatango> damage they deal
[2:06:20] <Mrdragonmaker> Status is pretty important imo
[2:06:21] <Teyaric> Reduces what they DEAL, not take, Plauge
[2:06:24] <tanarath> velocitus?
[2:06:41] <suikudo> mmm slash
[2:06:49] <Mrdragonmaker> Puncture reduces the enemy damage output
[2:06:50] <redrix_3> passes through armour
[2:07:57] <cap_bon> equinox AoE slash ability Kreygasm
[2:08:01] <Teyaric> Do you just not use the term "slash proc" on principle?
[2:08:12] <tanarath> Shotguns work with slash because 100% status pre multishot means every pellet will proc something.
[2:08:18] <suikudo> Equinox Kreygasm
[2:08:20] <Wonky_Woop> Nah, not really that complicated
[2:08:32] <redrix_3> tigris prime spam still a thing?
[2:08:40] <+eanscrale> Yeah this all makes sense, but I've been around since the plains.
[2:08:48] <mikukojitsu> i have never played this before and im lost as fuuuk
[2:08:52] <+imadoc91> Btw did the melee rework make a big difference?
[2:08:54] <+eanscrale> I can't imagine breaking it down to a beginner
[2:08:55] <tanarath> yes, but not as much, redrix
[2:09:08] <+imadoc91> I hated the wet pool noodle slap fest
[2:09:18] <MonoReaper> So basically you if you want to play you need a warframe mentor/teacher kind of thing to understand the systems?
[2:09:20] <xeros720> i feel like i play warframe every 2 years and it makes less sense every time
[2:09:42] <xeros720> speaking of a real videogame, it drives me nuts that it acts like a regular videogame
[2:09:47] <Mrdragonmaker> I mean, That why i love the game, build diversity is amazing, I hate it of that complexity was wiped from the game.
[2:09:50] <xeros720> then it becomes whatever it is after a few planets
[2:10:05] <tanarath> kinda @monoreaper, but some googling works too.
[2:10:11] <cap_bon> I remember back to beta when weapons still had this weird skill tree
[2:10:41] <+imadoc91> My main complaint was always that sure, there's a ton of build diversity, but most of the builds play the same way.
[2:10:49] <Mrdragonmaker> yeah, closed beta mod system was very odd and play to win
[2:10:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> But you used to be able to snipe with shotguns and now the damage falloff means nothing is viable for sniping but snipers
[2:11:17] <+imadoc91> which is press a button and everything around you dies
[2:11:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Crit does fuck all to space shit
[2:11:48] <+philosopher721> What is preventing them from just making the other regular damage types also scale with health? Like Impact permanently reducing armor by 25% or something
[2:11:55] <cap_bon> Mods having random stats and being completely random was awful at least I got a bunch of fusion cores out of it LUL
[2:11:57] <tanarath> impact is ok in space
[2:12:00] <Mrdragonmaker> LUL
[2:12:05] <redrix_3> i made a dera vandal with a 100% stat corrosive build. does no damage but evaporates armour
[2:12:37] <+imadoc91> I swear to fucking god, every game with an armor system should just copy League's armor calculations
[2:12:54] <xeros720> it feels like they don't play the game themselves
[2:13:04] <+philosopher721> it's weird
[2:13:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I made like three of my wepons simultaneously 100 percent status and crit thanks to rivens
[2:13:16] <Andele1503> @philosopher721 they kinda do, e.g. damage types that are good vs armor also ignore a % of armor equal to how much effective they are vs it, issue is its still that armors value is exponential as long as hp scales
[2:13:22] <tanarath> I saw that tweet, Plague, it sucks.
[2:14:04] <+imadoc91> I've never really liked armor as another healthbar over your main health
[2:14:06] <redrix_3> no homo
[2:14:17] <cap_bon> what do you prefer armour being a % damage reduction or armour just being an extra health bar?
[2:14:25] <redrix_3> thry
[2:14:27] <+philosopher721> @Andele1503 isn't that the big table that is really unfriendly to read? Like what something is weak to but only when it's raining on tuesdays?
[2:15:12] <+imadoc91> wow I predicted your question
[2:15:39] <+imadoc91> but yeah, in games where armor is an extra hp bar there always just seems to be weird dumb problems
[2:16:01] <+imadoc91> best example off the top of my head is Divinity OS2
[2:16:22] <redrix_3> take the nier automata route by making ai companions gods
[2:16:38] <ItsAbout9000> the pets dying only makes me feel bad.
[2:16:45] <BooitsDock> pets can buff and mech pets can res you
[2:16:55] <xeros720> i couldn't use the pets since them dying drove me nuts
[2:16:56] <+imadoc91> The entire game is a rush to remove armor or magic armor and then CC the enemy until they die. Then you have the problem too of wanting your party to just be one damage type
[2:16:59] <+philosopher721> I must protect cat at all costs to my own health
[2:17:30] <MonoReaper> Oh so pets/companions are loot magnets??
[2:17:38] <cap_bon> ltierally yes
[2:17:44] <+philosopher721> only the little robots
[2:17:47] <xeros720> yeah, there's a mod that makes them vacuum
[2:17:56] <+imadoc91> because it's better to just focus down and yeet an enemy to death instead of diversifying to better deal with encounters and resistances in the rpg.
[2:17:57] <+philosopher721> or did they finally give vacuum to cats and dogs?
[2:18:16] <+sourceofall> they did
[2:18:27] <xeros720> oh, by default? not mod needed?
[2:18:34] <+sourceofall> no, its a mod
[2:18:38] <xeros720> ah, right
[2:18:45] <+sourceofall> a different mod, so you have to level it again of course
[2:18:46] <+philosopher721> ah, I barely play anymore so I am not up to date
[2:18:53] <+imadoc91> wow I never realized how weird the scale feels in this game
[2:19:03] <cap_bon> spend mod slots to get basic functionality LUL
[2:19:06] <+imadoc91> that item was supposed to be 42 meters away?
[2:19:11] <MonoReaper> @PlagueOfGripes The 2 swords on your back look badass
[2:19:12] <BooitsDock> have you gotten a zaw riven yet?
[2:19:15] <+imadoc91> it looked like 3 meters away
[2:19:44] <+Zereaux> CUZ THEY WANT YOU TO PAY FOR IT
[2:19:59] <xeros720> oh, 100%
[2:20:10] <+Zereaux> also hey eli hey chat
[2:20:20] <cap_bon> I despise anything that has a 2% drop rate like fuck off make it 10% or just not let people have it
[2:20:21] <+imadoc91> Hi chat I am chat
[2:20:24] <xeros720> there's a literal table somewhere where they calculate the expected time to complete content
[2:20:29] <cap_bon> how are you chat im chat
[2:20:32] <+philosopher721> wait, you can pay for the Railjack mods with *real* money?
[2:20:38] <SivSarcast> Or they can just do a Hema and say "We're not going to change it, sorry"
[2:20:48] <+Firemane1279> @philosopher721 you can trade for them with Platinum
[2:20:55] <+philosopher721> OOF
[2:21:26] <+philosopher721> Here I thought they were ok because you had to earn primes but I guess that isn't the case anymore
[2:21:28] <tanarath> mags, plague
[2:21:35] <+Zereaux> hasnt the balance of archwing missions always been jacked up tho?
[2:21:43] <+imadoc91> I'm also turned off from playing railjack because I really don't like the Archwings
[2:22:05] <redrix_3> why did they nerf itzals blinks anyway?
[2:22:06] <+imadoc91> I've played like 5 Archwing missions and they were all miserable and dumb
[2:22:20] <xeros720> it should act like EDF where you can just nuke whole zones
[2:22:23] <+philosopher721> the Archwing missions are suffering
[2:22:23] <+eanscrale> It would be nice if the other archwings worked, yes.
[2:22:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think they just straight up need new, better archwings
[2:22:43] <redrix_3> nice
[2:22:47] <BooitsDock> nice
[2:22:48] <+philosopher721> amazing
[2:22:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> very nice
[2:22:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You apparently never used the odonata
[2:22:56] <redrix_3> plagueFace
[2:23:01] <fruit_pie_the_magician> like two of it's abilities literally did nothing
[2:23:01] <Archer27> oh no
[2:23:01] <Slim_Lipid> YEYEYE
[2:23:02] <xeros720> oh dear
[2:23:02] <+Skwizgarr> noclip?
[2:23:03] <+dante_must_die_exe> ohh
[2:23:03] <Ckale11> hmm
[2:23:05] <+Zereaux> OH OIKAY
[2:23:06] <BooitsDock> no its fine
[2:23:07] <+imadoc91> I also pretty much sold any archwing prime blueprints the second I got them
[2:23:07] <+philosopher721> AMAZING
[2:23:09] <BooitsDock> its fine
[2:23:19] <SivSarcast> That's because Elytron's powerful abilities got nerfed to the ground on PoE and Orb Vallis.
[2:23:21] <+Firemane1279> "this is fine" Kappa
[2:23:27] <+Zereaux> hahahaha
[2:23:33] <+imadoc91> Game handled that better than most games would though
[2:23:39] <+dante_must_die_exe> just don't think about it
[2:23:54] <+imadoc91> at least you didn't fall into space without the ability to interract with anything or use your archwing
[2:24:07] <+imadoc91> or into a placeholder space map
[2:25:01] <+Firemane1279> Hey, hey, Repair Maids make good money through that XP gain Kappa LUL
[2:25:03] <TheAsylumCat> heal bot/ white mage
[2:25:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I mean, Geordi really shouldnt be flying around outside with rockets strapped to his ass
[2:26:02] <redrix_3> why not just run zenistar then ?
[2:26:24] <+imadoc91> Is it not like OG battlefront 2 where you could hang out on the ship and do repairs and defend from borders?
[2:26:29] <+imadoc91> Are there borders?
[2:26:43] <+omegasis> 2h nikana wep
[2:26:45] <BooitsDock> pennta w/e its called
[2:26:46] <Slim_Lipid> Pennant?
[2:26:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> yeah pennant and it just looks like a sword
[2:27:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> and it has built in berserker
[2:27:08] <BooitsDock> it gives a speed boost and attack boost for 3 seconds
[2:27:15] <BooitsDock> and it stacks
[2:28:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can already destroy basically any enemy with a single heavy from my caustacyst
[2:28:44] <StonerStan101> @PlagueOfGripes You wonderful bastard how are you doing?
[2:28:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> something about the way scythes have forced bleed on heavies or something
[2:28:58] <+sourceofall> reaper prime can do a mixed heavy attack build if you go max combo efficiency. I assume there are other weapons that can do it too.
[2:30:21] <Andele1503> IMO heavy attacks biggest problem is that its a windup/channel time instead of actually charging. Charge attacks should have just been made to actually charge like bows/guns and drain combo/get more damage and range proportional to how much you charge them...
[2:30:30] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes Warframe player made types are a baby step towards this.
[2:30:39] <tanarath> tips
[2:30:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:31:20] <+sourceofall> but number go up is the only way to reward players tho? /sarcasm
[2:32:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The caustacyst is basically broken, it's heavy throws a wave of acid that has infinite punchthrough, blinds, opens enemies to finishers, in addition to proccing corrosive on them. it's basically a death sentence to enemies is hallways
[2:32:00] <+eldritchmouse> Gram Prime and Wolf Sledge are my favorite melee right now and neither are really heavy attack focused.
[2:32:17] <cap_bon> I love the whole staff gun thing for some reason
[2:32:54] <RedAhoge> hows not Not!Guns of Icarus(railjack)
[2:33:04] <redrix_3> inaros covert lethality builds are boring but still really op
[2:33:19] <Andele1503> Oh plague, what do you think about the raw amont of hard root animation locks DE added to melee stances which means that when pressing forward and attacking, you tend to be slower than just not holding w key since the """STATIC""" attacks have animation lock forward movement
[2:34:09] <+eldritchmouse> Ferrox Vandal or whatever the corpus equivalent of Kuva weapons ends up being.
[2:34:20] <+Zereaux> the self damage on expolsive attacks still around?
[2:34:40] <+sourceofall> yep, but you can spend a mod slot to reduce it by 90%
[2:35:12] <+Zereaux> I WANT IT TO NOT EXIST makes the game less fun
[2:35:30] <cap_bon> does warframe armour still translate over to archwing armour
[2:35:42] <RedAhoge> Testi-hammer
[2:35:46] <Andele1503> I still want to know what derp at DE decided that the ferrox waves dont benefit from status chance...
[2:35:46] <+sourceofall> it also just makes the already not particularly good explosive weapoons effectively unusable in many circumstances
[2:35:54] <Andele1503> because the ferrox would legit be good if it did
[2:36:10] <redrix_3> who is your favourite frame
[2:36:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> They buffed the shit out of that electric field, it used to do fuck all
[2:36:50] <+Tearonex> idk if rivens are good or bad... they feel so hit and miss for me
[2:36:56] <+eanscrale> How rewardiing
[2:37:09] <Andele1503> @fruit_pie_the_magician nah, it still does fuck all other than group enemies up/cc
[2:37:14] <cap_bon> every riven i get is a disappointment pepehands
[2:37:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I said they buffed it, not that it was super OP
[2:37:39] <aeonicvector> b-baka
[2:37:51] <xeros720> ahaha, that's a pull
[2:37:52] <+Townspoon> oh shit when did they take out intertia?
[2:37:58] <+zxyoloswag420blazeitxxz> is it fashionable to hate on arin now
[2:38:01] <+Zereaux> heh
[2:38:10] <+sourceofall> bout 2 montsh ago @Townspoon
[2:38:15] <+Townspoon> huuuuuuuuh
[2:38:18] <cap_bon> fine we'll let all companions collect loot but you'll hate it
[2:38:21] <+Townspoon> wow
[2:38:24] <Andele1503> they didnt even buff it, they bugged it to not benefit from status chance, ignored it for 2 years since that and then buffed the waves status chance from 33% to 50% but still didnt fix it
[2:38:37] <redrix_3> i sense... repressed anger towards the game grumps
[2:38:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It didn't used to have the energy wave at all, it just used to grab like three enemies with electric tethers that didn't even hold them. so they added the periodic stun field and extra damage, to keep them reeled it
[2:38:50] <suikudo> the fuck is htat?
[2:39:09] <+Zereaux> the future
[2:39:51] <cap_bon> does sharkwing still have inertia
[2:40:17] <Huntercd> Atlas Prime?
[2:40:44] <xeros720> those time trial missions are probably way easier too
[2:40:57] <cap_bon> sometimes realism isnt fun
[2:41:31] <Huntercd> Oh its hildy
[2:41:37] <Andele1503> @fruit_pie_the_magician Energy waves did exist/the damage ticks from them, just had no visuals
[2:41:53] <+Caidezes> Inertia on archwings felt awful. They're so much more fun now.
[2:42:13] <+Zereaux> forgot that i built itzal before i dropped warframe
[2:42:24] <Andele1503> maybe DE did buff the tick rate tho, not that it matters since the throws actual effectiveness didnt change/pull efficiency didnt get any better, just looks better
[2:42:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Well, I will say that I never knew they did that until I used it again and found it worked way way better than it used to
[2:43:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> In that it didn't used to do shit
[2:43:56] <Andele1503> might be placebo simply because one can actually notice what it always did visually
[2:43:56] <cap_bon> I wish I could just use regular guns in archwing PepeHands
[2:44:12] <+DocIrving> When's the wisp art gripe?
[2:46:22] <redrix_3> covers fire with fla
[2:46:51] <+DocIrving> Nice fashion frame on hildryn, btw
[2:46:52] <+Hallucinagenic> Yo, papa Plauge, just wanted to say thank you for getting me into this beautiful game! p.s volt is best boy
[2:47:06] <Huntercd> Pets need a buff my vampire cat is so quishy
[2:47:23] <cap_bon> how about making pets not take damage *shrug*
[2:47:35] <+eldritchmouse> I use Ivara the most and my usual second go to is Nezha.
[2:47:53] <+eldritchmouse> I don't like Loki much
[2:47:53] <+eanscrale> Unfortunately Volt's utility isn't great in the new content.
[2:47:58] <cap_bon> I just use Ivara and limbo to trivialize story content
[2:48:11] <redrix_3> but ivara artemis bow builds
[2:48:11] <Andele1503> I love ivara, she froppy
[2:48:16] <+eldritchmouse> The way Loki's invis works feels clunky af to me
[2:48:31] <+Hallucinagenic> i can respect that. i think i have some ingrained love for him because he was my first frame
[2:48:34] <+DocIrving> The main issue with spy is the lasers, not actually being seen, and by default, her prowl breaks lasers, so...
[2:48:35] <kerotuyu> I play a lazy Ivara, but Loki is faster.
[2:48:41] <tanarath> ivara ignores the lasers with her augment
[2:48:43] <+DocIrving> That's just what it is.
[2:48:47] <xeros720> Ivara players are trying to play a different game
[2:48:48] <aeonicvector> Ivara is a weird frame, she can do some ABSURD shit, but she's anti-speed and has some awkward workarounds
[2:49:04] <tanarath> I like loki, though
[2:49:12] <ECRead> I play Limbo so... I'll be over in the corner
[2:49:12] <Huntercd> I want to try Ivara but I am attached to Mirage
[2:49:19] <+DocIrving> How's the ferrox, plague?
[2:49:23] <$Lunaras13> i like ivara because of the silenced razor blade that i can control the flight of
[2:49:27] <Andele1503> Ivara was made for gameplay at a pace WAY slower than warframe usually encourages
[2:49:28] <+eanscrale> Natural talent exists too
[2:49:29] <kerotuyu> "vulnerability"
[2:49:40] <Andele1503> also that are shitty ivara players, her 1 cloak is instant
[2:49:46] <redrix_3> but ivara is more then just invis
[2:49:50] <Thepothero> I stealth lv 30 vaults with rhino p get at me chat
[2:49:50] <tanarath> loki is great for certain things like decoy & the like
[2:49:51] <aeonicvector> its because on super long runs, that 1/2 second IS death ~~except you can disarm~~
[2:50:04] <cap_bon> why cloak when you can just sit in the void Kreygasm
[2:50:26] <aeonicvector> why sit in the void when you can just be made of unbreakium
[2:50:27] <Andele1503> THAT WAS A NERF BY DE, you could bullet jump before, just not run or slide
[2:50:39] <redrix_3> ivara roll spam bois is how we do it
[2:50:42] <kerotuyu> dashwire
[2:50:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:51:00] <Andele1503> DE nerfing bullet jump in powl and navigator not pausing projectiles were 2 insanely dumb nerfs
[2:51:03] <redrix_3> just spam roll
[2:51:04] <tanarath> roll spam is great
[2:51:32] <Grandma_Amari> Oh hey I didn't know you were keeping up with Warframe, Plague!
[2:51:34] <+eldritchmouse> Double jump roll
[2:51:36] <Andele1503> nah nah, ivara is for thighs
[2:51:56] <sasparillatango> pop into operator and dash around
[2:51:59] <Thepothero> Sayrn and wisp butt tho
[2:52:06] <sasparillatango> or just use loki
[2:52:06] <xeros720> the Durst frame is powerful
[2:52:08] <+eanscrale> It's for fans of Ocarina of Time speed runs.
[2:52:09] <aeonicvector> the solution is mana-knife, which is a bandaid for a bisection
[2:52:09] <Croetec> Loki is best boy
[2:52:13] <Huntercd> Fred Dursting tho
[2:52:18] <redrix_3> but does loki have a nice ass
[2:52:26] <redrix_3> actually dont answer that
[2:52:31] <cap_bon> No. I want froppy thighs.
[2:52:40] <Andele1503> I mean, i just have a tanky ivara setup where i just stealth for stuff that needs stealth and just sleep+artemis stuff, but that too is a clunky answer
[2:52:49] <redrix_3> artemis bow tho
[2:52:52] <tanarath> rolling around at the speed of sound, Plague
[2:52:55] <Grandma_Amari> Ash is also not a bad option even though he can't stay invis outside using his smoke bomb.
[2:53:07] <gunsrlove> walk through spy missions
[2:53:15] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Doesn't her stealth just completely ignore all security?
[2:53:18] <aeonicvector> that alternate bow is also super solid for eidolons
[2:53:37] <Rivalshotzgp> Ivara bypasses the puzzle rooms? That‚Äôs the entire point, who cares about stealth outside those rooms
[2:53:40] <gunsrlove> rolling only is stupid but being invisible forever means she is immortal forever
[2:53:44] <tanarath> @gunsrlove there's an ability mod for her that dies that
[2:53:57] <Grandma_Amari> The real issue is Loki's OP as hell
[2:54:01] <Grandma_Amari> At least for stealth
[2:54:02] <gunsrlove> since eemies just turn off for her
[2:54:06] <xeros720> i'm telling you, they are playing a different game
[2:54:17] <xeros720> give those kinds of Ivara players copies of metal gear solid or Thief
[2:54:26] <cap_bon> who argues in favour for less mobility
[2:54:26] <redrix_3> i think the arrow swap thing is super fidgety tho
[2:54:32] <aeonicvector> Its what my group colloquially calls a "scott" problem,whenver theres something almost everyone agrees is fine, buts its changed #BlameScott
[2:54:44] <Ezio1317> Mod drop chance booster affects avionics too right?
[2:55:10] <+Hallucinagenic> Have you messed around with mirage at all?
[2:55:15] <+Malfested_Zero> Awkwardly?
[2:55:25] <redrix_3> only 1 i tolerate like that is equinox
[2:55:28] <Grandma_Amari> I'm curious how you'd change it because I find it works fine
[2:55:31] <The_Bob_Guy> 4 abilities on 1 button, BUT 3 OF THEM SUCK!
[2:55:43] <Huntercd> Jellyfish lingerie?
[2:55:53] <Andele1503> I wouldnt give her sprint in prowl nor slide, just return her ability to bullet jump and make its timing smoother so that people that didnt spend over 5 hours perfecting the timing in simulacrum, mostly because bullet jumping is already the main thing to move
[2:56:08] <aeonicvector> Navigators only use is Multiplier builds
[2:56:14] <Andele1503> Navigator was amazing when it paused projectiles
[2:56:15] <aeonicvector> which its not GREAT at
[2:56:16] <$Lunaras13> i would miss it, its fun
[2:56:21] <Andele1503> because you could use arca plasmor with it
[2:56:25] <Andele1503> or explosive weapons
[2:56:53] <gunsrlove> ALso
[2:56:59] <cap_bon> I really wish I could swap Equinoxs forms around. Love night version so much more
[2:57:11] <gunsrlove> Ivara is the solution for most annoying Riven Challenges
[2:57:18] <Grandma_Amari> Navigator really only seems worth it for stuff like Eidolon weakspot builds and memes like where you could use it with the Wolf's hammer.
[2:57:21] <Rivalshotzgp> Can‚Äôt you get status immunity on dashwire, also good for riven challenges
[2:57:35] <gunsrlove> Her cloak doesn't even count towards the "dont use abilities" requirement
[2:57:53] <aeonicvector> just combine sound and sleep, so it draws in, but also opens for finishers
[2:58:05] <tanarath> ^
[2:58:19] <Andele1503> @Grandma_Amari i mean, its also worth it to oneshot a lot of problems. Issue is her navigator no longer pauses projectiles
[2:58:43] <Grandma_Amari> @Andele1503 Did it add damage? I honestly forget.
[2:59:04] <+OranHexthief> seems a little counter intuitive though. hold abilities are not very common because holding buttons isn't very comfortable. also it would feel weird not to have all the arrows on one ability
[2:59:29] <Grandma_Amari> What do you think of Ivara Prime's design direction compared to normal Ivara?
[2:59:44] <redrix_3> noise is useless just replace it with a new arrow type like elemental proc
[2:59:48] <CaptainFrankincense> the problem is loki exists
[2:59:50] <aeonicvector> she can still generate from the Rakta knife, so its still infinite, just make duration more required
[2:59:51] <xeros720> dragon age origins had a good idea for stuff like that, just make the toggle reduce the max
[2:59:54] <Andele1503> @Grandma_Amari yus, it adds a total damage multiplier
[3:00:04] <gunsrlove> Just use Arcane Energize
[3:00:59] <cap_bon> all these new frames and im still just running around as Energy Vampire Trinity :(
[3:01:20] <TheAsylumCat> I heard people say Mesa is bad but I never had a problem with her.
[3:01:33] <Andele1503> IMO ivara needs no changes except to undo the 2 nerfs (return bullet jump in prowl and navigator), mostly exactly because loki (and ash) exist.
[3:01:34] <redrix_3> mesa always seemed solid to me
[3:01:59] <aeonicvector> P sure last devstream they said you will be able to cancel and refund builds, so only build what you REALLY need
[3:02:02] <Andele1503> Except her 1 which for some reason cant store for multiple shots
[3:02:03] <cap_bon> what are mesas other 3 abilities again?
[3:02:41] <TheAsylumCat> Mesa has a jammer which basically stuns
[3:02:43] <cap_bon> there are alot of frames were I cant remember what their abilities are besides the 1 good one
[3:03:14] <redrix_3> she always kinda gave me a mushroom vibe
[3:03:17] <TheAsylumCat> a shield that ricochetes shots back
[3:03:18] <Grandma_Amari> There's a kuva tennogen skin for Ivara that gives her a more hood-like floppy helmet thing.
[3:03:29] <Grandma_Amari> It looks really nice.
[3:03:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The obsidian skin is pretty nice
[3:03:33] <cap_bon> Graxx skins Kreygasm
[3:03:36] <TheAsylumCat> and aim bot as her 4
[3:04:17] <Grandma_Amari> It's not the Graxx skin @cap_bon but it definitely scratched that itch.
[3:04:26] <redrix_3> one of my favourite prime model is mirage. love the jester look
[3:04:31] <aeonicvector> i feel she needs tweaks, def not perfect, but alot of her kit is interesting
[3:04:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I think Inaros is working as intended, but he's BORING AS FUCK
[3:04:41] <kerotuyu> I want Mag to be able to survive the average toxin/slash proc
[3:04:47] <cap_bon> its all about me
[3:05:14] <gunsrlove> It is an issue
[3:05:15] <tanarath> thanks for streaming, plague
[3:05:21] <gunsrlove> but it is the price to play for immortality
[3:05:21] <CaptainFrankincense> just have this maxed out thing dude
[3:05:25] <Rivalshotzgp> You sit in the cloak arrow bubble to regen energy?
[3:05:32] <aeonicvector> i mean i dont run out of Mana, but Rakta dark dagger and speedrun to the vaults
[3:05:34] <gunsrlove> to pay*
[3:05:55] <redrix_3> but roll spam may be boring and dumb but it works and gets you across the map
[3:06:02] <Rivalshotzgp> You only need energy in the vault though??? You regen energy between vaults
[3:06:20] <+Caidezes> Just use Wukong. Kappa
[3:06:20] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Ivara might as well only have one move, and Inaros might as well have two
[3:06:23] <Andele1503> @aeonicvector tbf, RDD is a bandaid fix
[3:06:30] <Rivalshotzgp> I don‚Äôt even find her fun, she‚Äôs just way better at vaults
[3:06:38] <aeonicvector> oh for sure, RDD is manahax
[3:06:57] <cap_bon> I wanna use Nova more but shes just so boring which sucks becuase I love the Corpra Nova skin
[3:07:15] <Andele1503> @cap_bon Go for a kaboom setup spamming her 2
[3:07:27] <redrix_3> anyone have opinions on how thicc cephalon suda is?
[3:08:03] <aeonicvector> Suda is a cephalon, andthus part of the cephalon weave, which may or maynot be a pocket dimension
[3:08:12] <aeonicvector> ergo she planar-thicc
[3:08:13] <Andele1503> way more fun than the "urhh, i press 1 and then press 4 every 10-15 seconds"
[3:08:24] <Andele1503> Nor does loki
[3:08:31] <Andele1503> not loki, limbo
[3:08:34] <Andele1503> limbo*
[3:08:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I need to get the operator arcanes that give you those magnetic mines on void dash
[3:09:27] <Rivalshotzgp> The whole reason people use ivara is to go through the lasers
[3:09:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's like Shy and her Sybaris
[3:09:48] <redrix_3> that one augment
[3:09:56] <Andele1503> Nah, shy has a point, the sybaris looks sick
[3:09:59] <redrix_3> sybaris is great tho
[3:10:10] <CaptainFrankincense> I thought we used ivara so we could move rockets into peoples faces and laugh
[3:10:13] <aeonicvector> broke: quartakk Woke: Sybaris Bespoke: DakraPrime
[3:10:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The sybaris is fine, but it's not like the best
[3:10:29] <cap_bon> cosmic brain twin grataka
[3:10:33] <suikudo> Sybaris can do anything
[3:10:36] <Andele1503> @CaptainFrankincense we used to, then DE nerfed it by making 80% of explosive weapons boom in your face
[3:10:38] <gunsrlove> spy vaults and riven challenges , big stealth kill experience and being immortal in survivals
[3:10:47] <gunsrlove> thats why i use ivara when i need to
[3:10:53] <redrix_3> i got a phat fire rate twin grakata riv
[3:10:58] <redrix_3> it weeps ammo
[3:11:33] <cap_bon> if your twin grataka doesnt empty its magazines in less than a second its wrong
[3:12:16] <redrix_3> i have to add reload mods to maximize ammo consumption
[3:12:19] <aeonicvector> Comedy with a "does it feel good to use"
[3:12:28] <Stillchr> how animay is your ninja?
[3:14:02] <CeeDee__> man if I ever made any myself i'd love to tell ya
[3:14:05] <Andele1503> Shy appears as a shitposter/comedy, but usually actually hits points/problems of stuff quite early/faster than broz even gets to it
[3:14:09] <aeonicvector> iirc particle was one of the better elements, i dont know the numbers offhand tho since i avoided railjack for awhile
[3:14:33] <Andele1503> i think you need to hover and tab to get the stats
[3:14:40] <Andele1503> because pablo has a fetish for that shit
[3:15:08] <+ShogunNoonto> Vidar Carcinnox form some dud on reddit
[3:15:15] <redrix_3> yes
[3:15:19] <Andele1503> idk, a stupid ui choice everyone hates
[3:15:19] <aeonicvector> but yeah particle was one of the better elements, dont recall #1 tho
[3:16:03] <Bonbie> But the two sentences of fluff text are essential
[3:16:04] <sosuke5> Show them those receipts, Plague
[3:16:13] <VoxFoxWatch> Hello, I just got here, oh god bad UI, WHY WAS I ENTERING HERE!?
[3:16:49] <$Veomroa> Function over form imo
[3:17:57] <cap_bon> what does fall off mean is that meters? because meters dont seem to mean much in this.
[3:18:12] <aeonicvector> meters, but space meters
[3:18:36] <cap_bon> space meters suck ass
[3:19:18] <redrix_3> space should not have fall off at all tho
[3:19:26] <$VoxFoxWatch> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 of the times you should visit the wiki (2 of many), the first is for understanding how to work your broken game, and second is to try and understand something quickly that would take several days playing the game. Never thought I‚Äôd see a combo of the two. Crazy. All the love, Plague.
[3:19:27] <VoxFoxWatch> VoxFoxWatch's Cheer shared rewards to 3 others in Chat! 
[3:19:48] <+Firemane1279> I may as well be hugging the Railjack zimePalm LUL
[3:20:20] <$Rivalshotzgp> The most annoying thing is how much they lie, it‚Äôs 1 meter is not 1 real meter. Just say 1 mileag or something
[3:20:44] <$Rivalshotzgp> Like 2 km is like 10km ingame
[3:21:19] <redrix_3> you should really consider playing some doom to blow off steam
[3:21:23] <Andele1503> Its not range which is the most alarming
[3:21:30] <Andele1503> its the enemy stats to level
[3:21:34] <Andele1503> and enemy hp tpes
[3:21:36] <+eanscrale> It seems like the testing is what we're doing right now
[3:21:50] <Andele1503> WHY DO GRINEER, THE DEGENERATE CLONES, USE REGULAR INSTEAD OF CLONED FLESH???
[3:22:10] <theamazingroberto> spank them plague spank them with your words
[3:22:25] <%VoxFoxWatch> VoxFoxWatch subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:23:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> It ends alright for the most part
[3:24:00] <%VoxFoxWatch> This game seems as complicated as understanding the raw lyrics to ‚ÄúButtercup‚Äù by Jack Stauber.
[3:24:00] <cap_bon> are you doing all this shit solo
[3:24:17] <%VoxFoxWatch> Looks cool, BUT HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
[3:24:46] <tanarath> you could just keep them. look at the wiki or a YouTube vid?
[3:24:54] <%VoxFoxWatch> Just call me VoxFox. Everyone has a hard time getting to the watch.
[3:25:13] <$Veomroa> It's not fun solo, so much stuff to worry about
[3:25:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Playing this solo is like playing Monster Hunter solo
[3:25:40] <%VoxFoxWatch> @fruit_pie_the_magician Instant death.
[3:25:51] <cap_bon> filling out dojo research solo drove me mad so this sht looks awful solo
[3:25:54] <CaptainFrankincense> monster hunter solo is fun
[3:25:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Nah, doable, just boring as sin
[3:26:01] <%VoxFoxWatch> @fruit_pie_the_magician Not physically, but mentally.
[3:26:22] <seth45er> its weird cause ivara is a frog themed
[3:27:20] <%VoxFoxWatch> Lot‚Äôs of ideas seem good on paper, but if you can‚Äôt implement them properly... get someone else to do it before you murder that concept forever.
[3:27:34] <tanarath> none of us do, but it helps make horrible grinds into sane challenges.
[3:28:00] <cap_bon> why the fuck would you remove archwing homing melee
[3:28:07] <tanarath> Aww, no more Macross/Gundam melee?
[3:28:23] <tanarath> I loved that
[3:29:16] <CeeDee__> nice hammer spear
[3:29:22] <cap_bon> Bug testting live on stream
[3:29:49] <%VoxFoxWatch> That sounds like a medical condition. ‚ÄúMy dragon is sticking out of my midicine‚Äù
[3:29:54] <CeeDee__> Hey you know what's a fun bug in these crew ships? If you start hacking the core, then hit ESC it counts for taking down the shield
[3:30:50] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:31:11] <+ShogunNoonto> your lich was going to do rail jack stuff
[3:31:25] <suikudo> What is that weapon he is using on ground? Regent?
[3:31:35] <%VoxFoxWatch> One bug you should always test for. What is and what isn‚Äôt collidable. Can you collide into the enemy? O.k makes sense. Pass through a wall? Ah shit, here we go again.
[3:32:25] <cap_bon> push the boundaries of exterior collisions monkaS
[3:32:30] <+broaches> @PlagueOfGripes did you actually bind your recall to a hotkey
[3:32:41] <+broaches> i've seen a bunch of people play and almost never see them do that lol
[3:33:27] <%VoxFoxWatch> THE ENEMIES ARE WARPING.
[3:33:58] <%VoxFoxWatch> HEY Y‚ÄôALL PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE RUBBERBAND-MAN!~
[3:34:00] <suikudo> Oh ok
[3:34:11] <cap_bon> no more loot vacuuming just as DE intended
[3:35:06] <%VoxFoxWatch> Collision. Not even once.
[3:35:42] <+yuppie_water> so is the mode fun despite the obvious buggyness?
[3:35:51] <CaptainFrankincense> are the dogs still tamagochis of guilt and slow death?
[3:36:14] <+broaches> when's DE selling the $20,000 ships like star citizen tho?
[3:37:14] <cap_bon> is SC a con or just an Olympic level mismanagement problem
[3:37:39] <CaptainFrankincense> both
[3:37:59] <+broaches> they are doing work. But they also seem to have a ton of feature creep
[3:38:07] <SpookyBeef7> I actually just started the railjack quest myself, but I'll probably hold off on going far in on it until they fix things up a bit.
[3:39:02] <+broaches> They changed it at some point so they auto-statis if they're about to die
[3:39:07] <%VoxFoxWatch> That‚Äôs fucked up.
[3:39:25] <ECRead> it's why I just use robots
[3:39:49] <ha2ken> Heya Plague.
[3:39:53] <cap_bon> im still just using robo vacuum like a peasant
[3:39:57] <CeeDee__> 3/4 baked ideas that they just refuse to fleshing out
[3:39:58] <%VoxFoxWatch> Not to sound out of nowhere, but have you considered trying to make your animals in your sort of artwork? You‚Äôve created them pretty epically.
[3:39:59] <SpookyBeef7> Warframe is super ambitious, but the team hasa hard time properly implementing most of their stuff.
[3:40:13] <+Skwizgarr> man speaking of pets, trying to draw but my neighbors fucking dog is nonstop barking,
[3:40:17] <+Skwizgarr> it's killing me
[3:40:37] <+broaches> A few years ago DE Steve actaully did streams on sunday and started a new account to go through the new player experience
[3:41:04] <+broaches> he found a lot of minor QoL stuff he ended up fixing cause' of that but he eventually stopped doing the streams cause' he got too busy
[3:41:11] <+dante_must_die_exe> big combo feels good
[3:41:12] <ha2ken> Haven't played since before Plains of Eidolon. Is jumping back into Warframe worth it?
[3:41:31] <cap_bon> its free so all your losing is time if you dont like it
[3:42:37] <redrix_3> red crit kavats are best
[3:42:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Play as oberon
[3:42:45] <ha2ken> Hmm ok. I'll have to try it again sometime.
[3:42:52] <cap_bon> no. never.
[3:42:56] <%VoxFoxWatch> Hm. Lot‚Äôs of alien vibes here now.
[3:43:05] <%VoxFoxWatch> ‚ÄúGet away from her you BITCH‚Äù
[3:43:09] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The armor boost and heal and his passive keeps their asses really good and alive
[3:43:14] <%VoxFoxWatch> PLAGUE.
[3:43:17] <%VoxFoxWatch> GLITCH.
[3:43:46] <SpookyBeef7> That's a lot of glitching. HahaThisisfine
[3:43:59] <%VoxFoxWatch> Ah shit, HERE WE GO AGAIN.
[3:45:18] <cap_bon> yeah eat shit not cloned flesh clones
[3:47:15] <JustSuperish> did you mean toroids earlier?
[3:47:38] <afraidanuffin> I like her tiny paws
[3:48:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I got an early scrunched face kavat thats super ugly, i always keep masks on her
[3:48:20] <zam47> Finds lighter
[3:48:39] <zam47> lights paper on fire
[3:48:39] <cap_bon> bugs in my archwing!?
[3:48:41] <zam47> CurseLit
[3:48:45] <ECRead> doodStare doodStare doodStare
[3:48:58] <zam47> Tickle the butthole
[3:49:31] <cap_bon> Hotzone denied
[3:49:43] <%VoxFoxWatch> Not to sound anal about things, butt this is ridiculous, just be sure to rectum, you get me plague?...............ass.
[3:50:04] <EmeraldCrash> when the glitches for the 100th time plagueFace
[3:50:07] <redrix_3> dps
[3:50:38] <cap_bon> wtf is this za worldu shit
[3:50:53] <%VoxFoxWatch> @cap_bon Yare yare daze.

[3:51:03] <cap_bon> you attack a reactor and next thing your just on your ship with a dead kitty
[3:52:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> quite the challenge
[3:52:34] <%VoxFoxWatch> ‚ÄúThe game can‚Äôt fuck up anymore, right?‚Äù [The Game Will Remember This.]
[3:52:41] <cap_bon> quite the orgy of particle effects
[3:54:23] <redrix_3> the same issues the rest of the game... bugs
[3:54:39] <+dante_must_die_exe> i put a spoonful of DE bugs in my coffee every morning
[3:54:43] <cimturry> if your moving fast enough you cant see the bugs
[3:54:50] <+Senotaki> Carbides and Pustrels! PogChamp
[3:54:54] <cap_bon> have you done one of these missions without encountering a bug
[3:55:12] <redrix_3> a plan
[3:55:16] <%VoxFoxWatch> Let‚Äôs rethink pur
[3:55:27] <%VoxFoxWatch> Pur our lives.
[3:55:34] <DraxTD> Saw your Sticks video today @PlagueOfGripes , very nice work
[3:56:45] <+dante_must_die_exe> or people who draw on one layer
[3:56:57] <ECRead> yeeeeeeah, I've enough for me to look at and say I'm a-okay sticking with building and doing liches for now
[3:56:57] <%VoxFoxWatch> Hey, plague? Have you thought about playing any other games recently? I‚Äôve been replaying Xcom2, it went good.
[3:57:07] <ECRead> seen*
[3:57:15] <GaspidarIII> oooh boy grinding
[3:57:18] <%JJCheeker> I used to draw all the time but I haven't done so in awhile so I've lost all of my ability
[3:57:49] <%IceAge70> IceAge70 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Much Love from the Dillest Dozer
[3:57:54] <redrix_3> "the problem with her is that shes very brown"~plague
[3:57:56] <GaspidarIII> oh wait this is art gripe quickies
[3:58:11] <GaspidarIII> hihsasS hihsasS hihsasS
[3:58:33] <cap_bon> DS really spills its guts on what its mystery's are really quick
[3:58:37] <%VoxFoxWatch> Also, how does one get fan art on this stream? I‚Äôd love to draw something for plague one day. Try is a word.
[3:58:42] <cimturry> are you gonna spend 800 plat on the sexy kuva armor
[3:58:49] <redrix_3> yeah the space level was good
[3:59:02] <+eanscrale> Yeah nah, I stopped that
[3:59:10] <%JJCheeker> I totally forgot there was a space lvl
[3:59:57] <JustSuperish> I don't think toroids are tradable
[4:00:30] <GaspidarIII> Warframe is the most complicated farmvile gave ever to exist
[4:00:44] <+xenoriddley36> How ya doing plague?
[4:01:05] <Sunstalker> Just ignore that until you get a resource drop chance booster from a sortie or something
[4:01:05] <%VoxFoxWatch> Ah, like the dark souls thing of item finding, except you can improve your drop luck in dark souls.
[4:01:39] <suikudo> Interception type stuff
[4:01:39] <+xenoriddley36> would love to see your thoughts on 999/VLR. recently finished your Darksouls run for the first time
[4:01:58] <Sunstalker> I want the battle ship sequence from Zone of the Enders 2 FeelsBadMan
[4:02:00] <cap_bon> what other game modes could there be?
[4:02:09] <+Zereaux> survival....
[4:02:14] <+ShogunNoonto> a ship battle with a lich
[4:02:18] <%VoxFoxWatch> Wait, what about the new Elden Ring game? Have you seen that Plague? What do you think about it?
[4:02:19] <+xenoriddley36> @cap_bon Bullet hell ala touhou.
[4:02:20] <+dante_must_die_exe> i was honestly hoping this update was going to be like Heat Signature but I should have known better
[4:02:24] <+sourceofall> you have a wisp speed buff
[4:02:28] <redrix_3> something based around hunting a large ship and breaking in
[4:02:31] <cimturry> Id like real ship v ship battles. like the ghost ships in sea of thieves
[4:02:33] <+dante_must_die_exe> or rather realistic expectations
[4:02:39] <+Zereaux> ESCORT MISSIONS
[4:02:46] <vonmaultke> are ships really small or warframes really big in this?
[4:02:54] <+sourceofall> it ran out
[4:03:23] <+dante_must_die_exe> or SPACE MINING
[4:03:48] <+Zereaux> space pimping
[4:04:08] <redrix_3> cries in kuva survival
[4:04:41] <cap_bon> laughs in limbo time bubble
[4:04:49] <+Zereaux> the scale of these craft are weird....
[4:04:52] <Andele1503> I mean, by railjack logic they could remain level 1, they should just get extra 50000000 ehp for every enemy level, because according to railjack, level 20 enemies should have the ehp of level 80 base enemies
[4:05:19] <JustSuperish> Limbo does nothing for arby excavators
[4:05:29] <+dante_must_die_exe> the way DE intended
[4:06:53] <redrix_3> ah
[4:07:01] <redrix_3> yes
[4:07:18] <cimturry> good job
[4:07:19] <redrix_3> ah
[4:07:21] <cap_bon> err excuse me you forgot your name
[4:07:25] <Sunstalker> Isn't this the Void cloak avionic?
[4:07:27] <+ForlornCarton> possibly cloaked
[4:07:27] <Andele1503> The ship owner has the invisibility upgrade probabl
[4:07:39] <redrix_3> as intended
[4:08:07] <redrix_3> no need to test if everything you release is perfect on release
[4:08:15] <EmeraldCrash> quiek question, is it possible to get an infinite ammo glitch by accident?
[4:08:34] <Sunstalker> Ratchet and Clank still has better spaceship battles FeelsBadMan $
[4:10:52] <suikudo> They tried (poorly) to get rid of universal mods like vitality and shit but....
[4:11:06] <suikudo> The amalgam idea is another idea they just let die
[4:11:22] <Sunstalker> yeah, the space grineer don't have a rad weakness. It's viral and corrosive
[4:11:45] <Sunstalker> Because they gave them regular Flesh armor instead of Cloned Flesh 4Head
[4:12:12] <cap_bon> I love corrupted mods but alot of time your only building for 2 frame stats anyway so your losing nothing
[4:12:47] <Jodoxk1> in low level missions there is no shield
[4:12:52] <Murphio_GS> I'm curious, Plague do you know why exactly you play Warframe, because I can't see the appeal
[4:12:56] <CeeDee__> oh yeah you can tottaly just exit out of hackingv that
[4:12:59] <CeeDee__> works every time
[4:13:32] <+ForlornCarton> ... son of a
[4:13:34] <redrix_3> as intended
[4:13:36] <Ckale11> that's stupid
[4:13:39] <+ForlornCarton> Ha!
[4:13:47] <cap_bon> so every mission has been bugged LUL
[4:13:51] <sosuke5> video game making is hard, ok
[4:14:04] <TheFinalHazard> strong grineer engineering
[4:14:37] <GaspidarIII> hey plague you should run brozime's hildryn meme build where you never die
[4:15:11] <GaspidarIII> idk if its nerfed yet but its something
[4:15:41] <cap_bon> this was an "experience"
[4:16:04] <redrix_3> with enough flammable blankets you might smother the flame
[4:16:07] <Sunstalker> I really don't like the babysitting of the ship that you need to do. I would have liked it to be everyone comes in with their smaller ship
[4:16:19] <SpookyBeef7> The smoke inhalation builds character.
[4:16:29] <cimturry> i wanna be able to love warframe, partly because ive spent so much time in it but it really makes it hard to
[4:18:18] <Futurecity10> i want to see plague play runescape and watch him lose his fucking shit
[4:18:40] <sosuke5> I guess...
[4:18:45] <redrix_3> 10/10
[4:18:53] <+ForlornCarton> good times
[4:19:05] <SpookyBeef7> I think it's just the railjack stuff. Seems like it needed another six months in the oven.
[4:19:11] <Andele1503> the "meme build" is because the invul time with extra shield recharge made it so that the shields would come back in time before invul is down, but that works in 99.99% of cases no matter if you got recharge mods or not already with just the key
[4:19:49] <Sunstalker> You can buy slots, Plague BTW
[4:19:56] <Sunstalker> Straight from the market
[4:21:12] <+ForlornCarton> command is single player
[4:21:13] <Sunstalker> That's for solo runs with Liches
[4:21:25] <+ForlornCarton> for the "crew" they are adding
[4:22:44] <+ForlornCarton> have a good night
[4:23:00] <%JJCheeker> Thanks for the stream
[4:23:09] <+sieghart37> bitterHype
[4:23:12] <%JJCheeker> Have a good night you
