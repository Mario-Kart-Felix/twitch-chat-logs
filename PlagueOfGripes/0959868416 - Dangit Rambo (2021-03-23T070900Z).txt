[0:05:13] <BlueLunecy> You could use that girl as a football
[0:05:29] <BlueLunecy> What the fuck does bathroom smell mean
[0:05:31] <BrachyZoid> Don't these games have an already chosen path of who dies?
[0:05:48] <+spiegelspike> built for something alright
[0:05:49] <+twohitgood> mikan reminds me of an extrema parody of megumi from food wars.
[0:05:51] <Yummy_Nukes> who tf like bathroom smells???
[0:05:53] <filialpails> of those who you think will die, which are victims and which are culprits?
[0:05:55] <CaptHat211> Built to die. Just like a Ford.
[0:06:26] <+QuasartheHero> Japanese courts are nonsense with that 98% conviction rate
[0:06:46] <calaveracalibre> sup nerds what did i miss
[0:06:55] <deviljhojho_> is this like one of those old timey midnight movies
[0:06:57] <+sweetbeanamin> idk the like of bathroom smells is a red flag

[0:11:56] <BrachyZoid> So don't generalize, lady
[0:12:10] <BrachyZoid> Banana hair?
[0:12:13] <filialpails> how many monocoins is chiaki charging for her bath water?
[0:12:25] <arkv01> I appreciate her for being 43
[0:12:36] <arkv01> but still with the soul of a 16 year old
[0:12:45] <+acridpaladin> i liked the infernal noises better for her voice
[0:12:47] <+not_crabby> please you gotta think of your health just never do that again
[0:12:59] <lettersofsky> the death alter
[0:13:01] <Zeif00> louiseyPain
[0:13:13] <TheMoenia> skulls for the skull throne
[0:13:48] <el_r0berto> this is some good vtuber action
[0:14:09] <Artista_AF> there was an attempt LUL
[0:14:32] <+EpicLoremaster> How many SKINNWALKERS have you encountered, Plague?
[0:15:01] <+Shadowanroid> hewwo plague kun
[0:15:10] <TheMoenia> what were the other two? horses?
[0:15:10] <lettersofsky> great question. the answer is yes
[0:15:24] <filialpails> the island provides
[0:16:08] <+twohitgood> any shrine is kinda weird.
[0:16:34] <Johnmaddened> thanks artist
[0:17:08] <+shaidot> I was just about to sleep but if you're streaming Danganronpa? I'm in
[0:17:42] <lettersofsky> Sonia you would love this you weirdo
[0:17:42] <TheMoenia> who gives a shit about the photos? the shrine is the way bigger issue here
[0:18:09] <BlueLunecy> I think he means to burn it
[0:18:22] <Lord_Vance> sky burial?
[0:18:37] <Solokaldaka> ferretHYPE2 ferretHYPE more murdering teenagers
[0:19:08] <BrachyZoid> Dear god those are massive
[0:19:19] <BrachyZoid> That face uh
[0:19:44] <SoFarFetched> oh look its """"best"""" girl
[0:19:56] <TheMoenia> they did their best cooking those animal skulls until the skin and flesh sloughs of
[0:20:00] <BlueLunecy> She's got stubby arms
[0:20:16] <+rheviel> ironmouseHihi
[0:20:23] <ReiDuran> hiyoko is gremlin baby who needs to be thrown like a football
[0:20:25] <SoFarFetched> She uses the give up robot to help her.
[0:20:56] <Lord_Vance> its it's really hard to feel empathy for her knowing she's two seconds from spewing expletives at you.
[0:21:00] <deviljhojho_> they are all min maxed
[0:21:06] <lettersofsky> They're only good at ONE thing
[0:21:12] <ReiDuran> yeah, she's kinda insufferable
[0:21:23] <filialpails> they're not the best in the world, just the best among high-schoolers
[0:21:49] <BrachyZoid> Ah, the not fun one
[0:21:51] <Artista_AF> apparently the JP term is just "Ultimate High School [blank] " from what i heard from Dragon Grape fans
[0:22:02] <%hellsquad2> Man don't often see a professional Animal husbandry character
[0:22:08] <ReiDuran> yeah, it's "Super High School Level"
[0:22:23] <Artista_AF> but yeah, is a really wasted gimmick
[0:22:42] <ReiDuran> yeah, it's easy to be like "this person is the ultimate gamer" so you can just
[0:22:47] <ReiDuran> know what they are
[0:22:58] <ReiDuran> without having to actually spend forever elaborating
[0:23:13] <Lord_Vance> the ultimate thing really seemed like an excuse to just make them cookie cutter cliches.
[0:23:19] <ReiDuran> it kind of is
[0:23:33] <$serpenttucker> I wouldn't say nothing is done with their ultimate talents and such, and obviously the story is trying to make the fact that they are ultimates be the reason why they are in this situation, but yeah it otherwise doesn't matter much.
[0:23:45] <lettersofsky> oh
[0:23:49] <Solokaldaka> where did she get those
[0:23:49] <SoFarFetched> they look pretty lumpy
[0:23:50] <lettersofsky> lovely
[0:24:02] <SoFarFetched> maybe its just old ear wax
[0:24:04] <Lord_Vance> very few characters in the series actually USE their talents
[0:24:04] <BrachyZoid> Just spare femurs people have
[0:24:07] <BlueLunecy> They DO got spare corpses
[0:24:20] <waitingontheworld> Plague on Twitch? inject this straight into my veins
[0:24:53] <HelghastTroop> whats with plague streaming in the goon hours ?
[0:24:54] <BrachyZoid> Her tears looked like pupils there
[0:25:18] <lettersofsky> I love Ibuki
[0:25:29] <BrachyZoid> LUL
[0:25:33] <ReiDuran> Becky is pretty good
[0:25:38] <BrachyZoid> brachy1SNITCHES The hate boner
[0:26:02] <TheMoenia> the duality of man
[0:26:18] <Lord_Vance> and like that all empathy is dead again
[0:27:16] <+shaidot> it's not despair it's "zetsubou"
[0:27:18] <HelghastTroop> well what about surviors guilt or whatever
[0:27:23] <lettersofsky> here he comes
[0:27:34] <filialpails> "zetsubou" is more literally hopelessness
[0:28:01] <Lord_Vance> that's kind of what they're aiming for. the futility of their fight against the killing game.
[0:28:06] <HelghastTroop> i like the word overwought
[0:28:08] <Johnmaddened> giving up
[0:28:20] <+shaidot> nihilism?
[0:28:31] <0rond> Hey plague, how you liking this one so far?
[0:28:39] <Artista_AF> Cinnamons are great, love them in tea lunarSmug
[0:29:02] <Solokaldaka> I have the dejection pretty bad FeelsBadMan
[0:29:48] <0rond> the iconic "danganronpa face" is fluids out of every orfice
[0:30:01] <scottjefferson2punto0> persona 4 on PC looks really weird
[0:30:13] <+shaidot> the sad part is, the anime sucks
[0:30:24] <mellorolo> hi-llo
[0:30:25] <Lord_Vance> oh boy does it
[0:30:28] <big_oistin> theory: everyone acts weird because they're dehydrated from snotting so much
[0:30:36] <0rond> the monologue narration is very much a VN thing only
[0:30:40] <lettersofsky> it's coming
[0:30:47] <lettersofsky> the premise is coming
[0:30:51] <wisdom_manari> yo just got this app so I can creep on plague as he games
[0:31:08] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:31:10] <+not_crabby> she can eat dis DICK
[0:31:17] <HelghastTroop> no one ever thinks about choking on food ever
[0:31:21] <HelghastTroop> thats stupid
[0:31:22] <SoFarFetched> ah Tan Paige
[0:31:33] <+EpicLoremaster> Plagues waifu "Eats like a HORSE"... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.
[0:31:36] <+shaidot> the islands of D2 are probably the most unique settings in the story
[0:32:00] <Lord_Vance> I liked the setting of d3 a lot.
[0:32:21] <bettysharkface> I wanna know why despair boy hasn't been tied up again
[0:32:23] <+shaidot> you mean d3 or V3?
[0:32:25] <SoFarFetched> I mean some of these people aren't great in general.
[0:32:26] <0rond> not sure how I feel about akane, she always seemed like a more extreme, one dimensional replacement for asahina
[0:32:43] <Lord_Vance> v3, sometimes I forget the distinction
[0:32:56] <BrachyZoid> Perfection
[0:32:58] <Solokaldaka> FeelsGoodMan
[0:32:59] <SoFarFetched> that's a good angle
[0:33:03] <BrachyZoid> brachy1Good
[0:33:04] <HelghastTroop> whats with the fart gass over those skulls
[0:33:04] <Johnmaddened> booba
[0:33:05] <CaptHat211> Its a lovely picture
[0:33:07] <lettersofsky> akane's artist we see you and appreciate you
[0:33:07] <+EpicLoremaster> Darkside Phil-like...
[0:33:11] <+QuasartheHero> bitterOK
[0:33:12] <lettersofsky> ew
[0:33:14] <arkv01> I'll never say not to booba VoHiYo wait thats not...
[0:33:14] <CaptHat211> No thanks
[0:33:16] <BrachyZoid> why
[0:33:16] <+QuasartheHero> bitterGun
[0:33:22] <+shaidot> V3 is really good looking, massive step up in terms art and style imo
[0:33:25] <+Cook_4_Souls> Hey everyone
[0:33:25] <+SuspiciousJosh> anyone got a similar belly button to the rabbit
[0:33:28] <lettersofsky> i hate that the belly button just protrudes over the diaper
[0:33:30] <ReiDuran> At least her theme is good.
[0:33:34] <+rheviel> ironmouseThink
[0:33:53] <0rond> it's pretty meh 3d beat em eup
[0:33:54] <Johnmaddened> it's not a very fun minigame I don't blame you
[0:34:04] <filialpails> I sure hope no murders take place on the new island!
[0:34:12] <BrachyZoid> There's a lot of work to be done
[0:34:21] <Solokaldaka> why not both?
[0:34:21] <lettersofsky> great question
[0:34:40] <Lord_Vance> why not both?
[0:34:53] <HelghastTroop> well any living thing that has sentience that isnt human is conncerning
[0:35:15] <+shaidot> How much are engaged in the underlying plot (outside the murders) for these games?
[0:35:49] <HelghastTroop> thats just lord of lies book
[0:36:02] <HelghastTroop> flies
[0:36:29] <lettersofsky> the developer's can't encourage that bondage stuff too much
[0:36:30] <Solokaldaka> if these kids care and they are dropping like flies I'm sure the merica version would be a full on melee
[0:36:34] <ReiDuran> Are you suggesting he isn't like that normally?
[0:36:36] <Lord_Vance> every dandy rampart ost is great
[0:36:50] <mike2hands> What did i walk into? Hi plague
[0:37:01] <BrachyZoid> LUL

[0:38:09] <0rond> she's the sherrif
[0:38:11] <+Surf_Zombie> Cheer100  Thank you for all the years of questionable entertainment bud!
[0:38:15] <TheMoenia> true her shirt does not belong
[0:38:24] <$serpenttucker> I dunno if it started with the last game or this one, but it seems like everyone in all the games have like some sort of iconography on them that doesn't mean shit.
[0:38:27] <Johnmaddened> you never know
[0:38:28] <BrachyZoid> Didn't the last sporty brown girl got killed in 1?
[0:38:41] <Solokaldaka> true

[0:44:35] <tukds> the giant amp and stage in the back
[0:44:53] <+rheviel> music sure does play
[0:45:00] <HelghastTroop> you think ibuki unironically enjoy blood on the dance floor
[0:45:29] <Lord_Vance> she's very manic pixie dream girl
[0:46:36] <HelghastTroop> could be vampires even
[0:46:59] <bettysharkface> Time to bust out the bluegrass at the Titty Typhoon
[0:47:09] <Boxbunnytheliar> Phoenix Wright?
[0:47:11] <ReiDuran> no it's a ladder
[0:47:16] <TheMoenia> i bet you play sick banjo solos in the dance barn, plague
[0:47:18] <Johnmaddened> whaddya mean those are plain ladders :)
[0:47:29] <big_oistin> special midnight screening of sharknado vs titty typhoon
[0:47:46] <+rheviel> "what are you doing step-ladder?"
[0:47:48] <HelghastTroop> why are there stickers on a chair
[0:48:32] <ReiDuran> hajime is not smart
[0:48:59] <HelghastTroop> farmer is paranoid about math
[0:48:59] <TheMoenia> that is the way
[0:49:04] <bettysharkface> Teachers giving you shit about showing your working?

[0:50:04] <Artista_AF> Lambada is fun music
[0:50:27] <bettysharkface> I hope she does a big murder
[0:50:30] <+shaidot> If Catalonia split from the Spain would it be bigger than Portugal?
[0:50:32] <Artista_AF> good for drunk dancing at bars
[0:50:34] <Lord_Vance> Sonia has a very odd patchwork of knowledge
[0:50:43] <Glasphemy> so it's a twitch stream now
[0:50:47] <arkv01> still the gremlin
[0:50:52] <bettysharkface> Probably Sonia
[0:50:54] <0rond> yeah he's pretty good
[0:50:56] <ReiDuran> Sonia and Gundham are great
[0:50:57] <Artista_AF> the titty one with the titty

[0:51:05] <$serpenttucker> Yakuza gremlin/titty monster
[0:51:10] <Lord_Vance> for this game, Gundam.
[0:51:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:51:18] <HelghastTroop> i like the rabbit homunculus
[0:51:20] <$serpenttucker> Oh fuck me I also like gundam too
[0:51:21] <+shaidot> I like Nagito purely because he's the most interesting. Akane is best girl tho
[0:51:33] <bettysharkface> Teru also had a weird accent
[0:51:36] <ReiDuran> BOSS BABY
[0:51:44] <+not_crabby> best girl
[0:51:46] <0rond> teruteru wanted his mommy
[0:51:52] <lettersofsky> I have a soft spot in my heart for awful asshole nagito
[0:51:52] <Johnmaddened> Nagito and Chiaki are my faves
[0:51:56] <arkv01> goblin LOVE
[0:51:57] <+AndrewsLovesPizza> well shitting is reverse anal sex After all
[0:52:05] <HelghastTroop> @ReiDuran shout out to alec baldwin
[0:52:07] <0rond> hiyoko is the goblinest
[0:52:12] <bettysharkface> "Squish squishy" is listed as her likes
[0:52:21] <bettysharkface> The goblin likes tittos
[0:52:22] <ReiDuran> Mikan is A FETISH
[0:52:30] <arkv01> pegora...
[0:52:43] <Lord_Vance> pain peko
[0:52:50] <CaptHat211> Ow...
[0:53:23] <TheMoenia> remind me, why is her arm bandaged up?
[0:53:25] <Indigoblade> I like the music of this so far
[0:53:40] <0rond> nah I think you are suppoused to dislike her
[0:53:41] <arkv01> she's too vanilla for our audiences TehePelo
[0:54:00] <HelghastTroop> submissive means ideal mate in japan
[0:54:22] <Lord_Vance> @themoenia she's very accident prone
[0:54:23] <0rond> mikan is like, she's so actively tropier than the rest I think you are suppoused to get tired of it
[0:54:47] <$serpenttucker> Gundum is precious to me
[0:54:57] <TheMoenia> thanks @Lord_Vance
[0:55:04] <0rond> mikan falls and gets hurt pretty often, it checks out tbh
[0:55:30] <ReiDuran> HE'S SO GREAT
[0:55:32] <Lord_Vance> Gundam is a good boy, the hammys are great too.
[0:55:39] <lettersofsky> gundham tell us about your medical scar
[0:55:42] <HelghastTroop> i want to get one of those jackets hes got on
[0:55:48] <HelghastTroop> look cool as heck
[0:55:57] <0rond> he's chuuni
[0:56:20] <$serpenttucker> Sounds like a vast majority of the cast
[0:56:24] <+rheviel> chuuni af
[0:56:25] <arkv01> gundams okay but I'd throw him in the pit if we needed a sacrifice
[0:56:32] <Lord_Vance> you mean his HELLHOUND EARRING that he got for stealing the mighty Cerberus into subservience in tartarus?
[0:56:45] <TheMoenia> gundam has heavy second grade syndrome
[0:56:47] <Lord_Vance> sealing*
[0:57:23] <BlueLunecy> It's a very American style motel.
[0:57:30] <Solokaldaka> road side hotels?
[0:57:33] <sosuke5> They have inn's more commonly, I guess
[0:57:34] <arkv01> american motels have a very distinct look from the rest of the worlds
[0:57:54] <ReiDuran> Wow, really? I couldn't stand her
[0:58:00] <Lord_Vance> fun fact: chuunibiyou or eight grader syndrome is Gundam's schtick. so calling it second grader syndrome isn't far off.
[0:58:02] <0rond> she won't accept marriage but not because of age but because she doesn't respect anyone on earth enough to see them as equal
[0:58:15] <Artista_AF> she has lived so long she sees Marriage as free insurance money
[0:58:59] <0rond> she's not wrong, she's just an asshole
[0:59:14] <HelghastTroop> oh sociopath
[0:59:16] <$serpenttucker> I dunno that I have ever described any car I have seen in my life as "rotting"
[0:59:25] <HelghastTroop> thats a trait that can make you trust someone
[1:00:04] <lettersofsky> she's 134 she doesn't care about that sort of stuff anymore
[1:00:13] <HelghastTroop> fun fact old poeple have more stds than younger poeple do
[1:00:13] <BlueLunecy> No visiting the motel with Akane
[1:00:38] <TheMoenia> old people fuck all the time. you have no idea what is going on in homes for the elderly
[1:00:54] <Lord_Vance> that's sort of an issue of the game type, if you can only interact with things that'll be relevant to the murders you're more likely to figure it out too fast. they rely heavily on the red herring of random junk.
[1:01:13] <$serpenttucker> BRO THAT SHIT IS DANGEROUS AS FUCK
[1:01:14] <HelghastTroop> @TheMoenia exactlly
[1:01:18] <Samex_Comex> Damn looking good Zelda

[1:04:12] <sosuke5> Chihiro

[1:05:47] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> just had a guy kicked out of my discord, they absolutely shit
[1:05:49] <jumpyhugs> I'm sure there are sub categories
[1:05:53] <Artista_AF> Ignorance is bliss
[1:05:54] <HelghastTroop> all i know is that they had some of those at that rainfurest con
[1:06:13] <ReiDuran> this track is good
[1:06:23] <Lord_Vance> oh boy the tragedy
[1:06:44] <+sashagreenspiderqueen> we raised them well
[1:06:48] <$thomassolorio> Nani 5 present
[1:07:08] <HelghastTroop> only people from japan can survive world disasters no one else in the world is smart enough
[1:07:11] <Solokaldaka> they must have toppled the student council ferretWANT
[1:07:54] <HelghastTroop> how did people go extinct in that game tokyo jungle
[1:07:56] <filialpails> mukuro
[1:08:01] <$thomassolorio> yo plagues maximus
[1:08:02] <$serpenttucker> 16th studen
[1:08:06] <HelghastTroop> enyone even know about that game
[1:08:07] <Lord_Vance> it's an attempt? to explain it.
[1:08:10] <ReiDuran> MUKURO IKUSABA THE 16TH STUDENT HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THE SCHOOL
[1:08:13] <ReiDuran> WATCH OUT FOR HER
[1:08:19] <sosuke5> Bad things. Many bad things!
[1:08:49] <Solokaldaka> ResidentSleeper here we go again
[1:08:50] <Jjaz_R> I don't understand the hype for this game. So far it just looks really stupid.
[1:09:04] <ReiDuran> it's a very silly game
[1:09:09] <ReiDuran> it's like junk food
[1:09:26] <ReiDuran> it makes NO sense
[1:09:26] <Lord_Vance> I'm a fan of this series, I'll freely admit it's pretty stupid.
[1:09:27] <HelghastTroop> i do think the appeal is for the weridness
[1:09:30] <jumpyhugs> the "Great Tragedy" was the creative writing prompt
[1:09:34] <TheMoenia> hopes peak academy is archduke franz ferdinand, obviously
[1:09:36] <ReiDuran> like the second you actually think about it it kinda falls apart
[1:09:45] <+rheviel> ironmouseWTF ironmouseThink
[1:09:48] <ReiDuran> but it's fun
[1:10:12] <jumpyhugs> ding dong bing bong!
[1:10:14] <big_oistin> maybe the gimmicks carry the writing further for the target audience
[1:11:38] <Jjaz_R> So is everyone else in the world dead, then?
[1:12:37] <HelghastTroop> well yea everone is jsut dumb your the only one that has a brain that can think
[1:12:45] <ReiDuran> it checkers
[1:13:07] <Lord_Vance> Yeah, they're spoonfed bits when it's just the right moment
[1:13:53] <HelghastTroop> hey plague did you ever have one of those old consoles that you had to screw on the back your tv?
[1:14:04] <$serpenttucker> Like, if electricity is arcing like that, that shit would be bright as fuck
[1:14:35] <ReiDuran> also giant robots.
[1:14:37] <big_oistin> oh

[1:15:12] <Jjaz_R> dafuq
[1:15:34] <Solokaldaka> chain saw murder please
[1:15:35] <Lord_Vance> basically an anarchy cult ruining the status quo yeah
[1:16:38] <ReiDuran> You can use the Atari controller on the Genesis

[1:19:52] <HelghastTroop> hey its the moto that i live by
[1:21:15] <HelghastTroop> fuck no wonder no one is happy working at companies in japan
[1:21:28] <HelghastTroop> got to deal with shitty mascots all the time
[1:21:54] <lewdnekojam> ah the shity 5star ssr i demand a refund just seeing him
[1:22:38] <ReiDuran> its.
[1:22:40] <ReiDuran> not great.
[1:22:42] <sosuke5> It wasn't great
[1:23:13] <+xiccy> nope. not good
[1:23:23] <HelghastTroop> japanese games, they are either real awesome or supremely dull
[1:23:43] <lycandruid> plague can we talk about you watching crazy catgirls
[1:23:55] <lycandruid> vtuber
[1:24:16] <ReiDuran> Sonia best
[1:24:22] <lewdnekojam> mufins virgins vs cookiechads
[1:24:34] <Lord_Vance> she's a precious cinnamon roll
[1:24:59] <TheMoenia> shes from fake liechtestein right?
[1:25:03] <branmuffinss> what a weeb
[1:25:05] <lettersofsky> she loves those j-dramas
[1:25:06] <GunBuster07> now draw her watching this japanese medical drama
[1:25:26] <HelghastTroop> any foreigner that vists japan is a weeaboo obviously
[1:25:46] <Lord_Vance> they really did say "this is how you weebs act"
[1:26:19] <lewdnekojam> good man
[1:26:30] <GunBuster07> i watched some K-drama with my sister once for the exact same effect
[1:26:31] <lewdnekojam> i did the same with a friend of mine
[1:26:34] <lol_Last> D:
[1:26:39] <ReiDuran> plague the home-wrecker
[1:26:44] <GunBuster07> other country soaps are crazy
[1:26:51] <lewdnekojam> reminds me of those indian drama movies
[1:27:11] <Lord_Vance> oh god the indian dramas with the flash cuts
[1:27:31] <TheMoenia> doesnt even need a toilette
[1:27:33] <lewdnekojam> or the horse drifting scene
[1:27:35] <lycandruid> he a good boy
[1:28:02] <GunBuster07> have confidence
[1:28:02] <lewdnekojam> my favorite one was the india vs pakistan drama
[1:28:08] <GunBuster07> no confidence
[1:28:30] <Solokaldaka> maybe your a teacher D:
[1:28:37] <ReiDuran> fingers
[1:28:48] <ReiDuran> (in his ass)
[1:28:51] <HelghastTroop> what!?
[1:29:09] <Lord_Vance> oh man I had repressed the kanye video
[1:29:15] <luchasloth> working at 3am in wisconsin and papa plague is on ah hell yeah
[1:29:38] <ferbeholds> it goes so far
[1:29:42] <GunBuster07> that's a bit blanket
[1:29:59] <arkv01> it has to do with the language, its either really clever or not at all
[1:30:00] <GunBuster07> they got some solid slapstick content though
[1:30:56] <lewdnekojam> gintama had alot 0f g00d jokesa
[1:31:01] <ReiDuran> I thought Konosuba was funny
[1:31:05] <ReiDuran> dunno about clever though
[1:31:07] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:31:14] <arkv01> theres a lot of stuff in the puns and language structure that doesn't get localized
[1:31:38] <GunBuster07> or just don't translate
[1:31:41] <Lord_Vance> absurd humor is big in Japan though. just look at some of their game shows.
[1:32:02] <lewdnekojam> its a japanese bambo folded a thousend times
[1:32:08] <tanarath> The bear gave it to her in the puppet punishment, Plague.
[1:32:13] <TheMoenia> arm under the blanket, therefore arm is hacked off?
[1:32:26] <arkv01> I also enjoy eric andre more as I get older LUL
[1:32:54] <GunBuster07> gintama leans heavily on "ludicrous" but it's always got immaculate comedic timing
[1:33:48] <+not_crabby> he put them on fishinglines
[1:33:50] <+not_crabby> Kappa
[1:34:18] <sosuke5> damn right!
[1:34:19] <lettersofsky> he's had his moment
[1:34:56] <Lord_Vance> the strings were a big part of it though. the whole execution was a play on traditional puppeteered story telling. it treated peko as a lone samurai against an army.
[1:35:04] <Indigoblade> oh my boobs
[1:35:27] <ReiDuran> it really sucks when you're under the covers and you do a huge fart and you have to air that out because otherwise you're basically hotboxing it
[1:35:42] <GunBuster07> look I know how DR looks in general but it's never not gonna catch me offguard
[1:36:33] <HelghastTroop> HAHA boner talk
[1:36:33] <Glasphemy> not it, IT
[1:36:54] <Dlent_> Almost literally girl goku
[1:37:02] <$serpenttucker> Wow they really like the stephen king movie
[1:37:03] <0rond> don't sand bag it's making you giggle
[1:37:08] <GunBuster07> so about how clever japanese humor is again
[1:37:10] <Glasphemy> not it, shit
[1:37:55] <GunBuster07> japan kinda lacks empathy at a people level so that's on point
[1:38:01] <TheMoenia> he probably feeds them their own children, as hamsters are wont to do
[1:39:03] <Lord_Vance> the dark devas feast upon the souls of the damned. but nah really I'm sure there's fruits and nuts readily available.
[1:39:04] <lettersofsky> the hive doesn't allow for individual emotions, that's ew
[1:39:19] <ferbeholds> little chiaki horns
[1:39:45] <GunBuster07> like i remember that Trigger show Kiznaiver who's entire message was "ermpaty bleas evurywan"
[1:39:51] <GunBuster07> shit show
[1:40:03] <tanarath> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[1:40:13] <+vivaldiva> zoneNotLikeThis
[1:40:45] <ReiDuran> live NTR
[1:40:45] <ahaegotrigger> its probably good he doesnt have the courage
[1:40:53] <tanarath> plague, you should play yakuza 7.
[1:40:57] <ferbeholds> what a hero
[1:40:59] <Jjaz_R> lol
[1:41:00] <+not_crabby> poggers sex predators
[1:41:15] <tanarath> Yes
[1:41:16] <$serpenttucker> yes
[1:41:17] <ahaegotrigger> yeah thats it
[1:41:24] <TheMoenia> yeah its yakuza quest 7
[1:41:27] <GunBuster07> i both have an irreverent respect for the country and want to scoop entire parts of it out
[1:41:29] <tanarath> Yeah, Ichiban is peak himbo.
[1:41:34] <skelfae> it's so dumb it's the best
[1:41:46] <jumpyhugs> I come to plagues content for sexy predators, not sex predators
[1:42:03] <tanarath> Plague, it is the best game yet, both dumb & serious.
[1:42:04] <GunBuster07> gonna get kyaa slapped
[1:42:27] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:42:34] <tanarath> and most of the stuff actually makes more sense than it has a right to.
[1:42:35] <ReiDuran> Akane that's a lot of drool
[1:42:44] <+vivaldiva> LUL
[1:42:47] <jumpyhugs> ........ masseur
[1:43:01] <ahaegotrigger> they both only require certificates
[1:43:13] <GunBuster07> i mean that looks nice
[1:43:19] <GunBuster07> i could use a massage
[1:43:26] <ahaegotrigger> Yes LUL
[1:43:43] <TheMoenia> chiropractor is bs
[1:44:10] <ahaegotrigger> oh god I was thinking about a rub room before you said tearing their arms off
[1:44:18] <GunBuster07> guy's got no taste for sideboob, what a nerd
[1:45:08] <GunBuster07> it kinda reminds me of the "next episode" talks some shows do with it's VA's
[1:45:19] <ferbeholds> true
[1:46:50] <ahaegotrigger> she could just be suicidal
[1:46:59] <ahaegotrigger> it would explain the blood on her wrists
[1:47:48] <ReiDuran> they cute
[1:48:03] <GunBuster07> i just came back to this tab, what the fuck am i looking at
[1:48:04] <lettersofsky> or is a rescue
[1:48:23] <TheMoenia> is his scar just painted on?
[1:48:27] <ReiDuran> he's just chuuni
[1:48:27] <0rond> but he isn't really a supervillain
[1:48:32] <arkv01> thats it VoHiYo
[1:48:38] <arkv01> thats his shtick
[1:48:43] <+Rutilas9000> he's just weird
[1:48:43] <Ekaelis> Is that eye fake too?
[1:48:53] <0rond> edgy boy that likes cute animals
[1:49:06] <0rond> there's value in that character
[1:49:14] <ZE_Count> its 4am plague
[1:49:38] <ahaegotrigger> the having to drink with you coworkers rule just goes too far
[1:49:46] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:49:52] <%Edzi_Sedzi> every country has its weird work culture quirks. talking about pay in the US will always make things weird lol
[1:49:54] <arkv01> lot of group unity customs etc
[1:49:56] <Lord_Vance> he's a chuuni his gimmick is that he's an edgy kid who thinks he actually has devil powers. that gap in personality with the cute hamsters is still the overall schtick though.
[1:50:01] <GunBuster07> chad thundercock has entered the stage
[1:50:04] <TheMoenia> his bulge looks like its all ball and no dick
[1:50:10] <arkv01> and BOOBA wife
[1:50:21] <seth45er> that guy is wearing Carl's sweat pants.
[1:50:45] <Ekaelis> I never got why they can still be so upbeat after 4 people are dead
[1:50:46] <+acridpaladin> Is she aging in dog years?
[1:50:47] <ahaegotrigger> oh man 2005 in a character
[1:51:12] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:52:04] <+tussletoes> I would be obliterated if I showed some music to someone and they said I was brave.
[1:52:09] <TheMoenia> well, marylin monroe died her pubes
[1:52:33] <ahaegotrigger> what color
[1:52:46] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[1:52:47] <+tussletoes> Yeah sounds like a good time.
[1:52:48] <jumpyhugs> any time after ding dong bing bong
[1:52:50] <ReiDuran> sounds great
[1:52:52] <ahaegotrigger> sounds great
[1:52:54] <GunBuster07> fug

[1:55:57] <+vivaldiva> LUL
[1:55:59] <arkv01> YOU DIDNT WIN
[1:56:21] <arkv01> the ethernet cord disconnected itself
[1:56:36] <@Nightbot> @Jjaz_R -> Beep Boop! [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[1:56:41] <+0ni0n_L0rd> how is he enjoying it?
[1:57:00] <TheMoenia> crushed him in vitrua fighter 2.1 probably
[1:57:54] <Jjaz_R> PJSalt
[1:58:03] <JeedyJay> It's the same thing in Anime Land!
[1:58:06] <ReiDuran> shhhh its fine
[1:58:14] <ReiDuran> (it is dumb)
[2:00:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> he does look like he'd make huge shits
[2:02:01] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:02:12] <sosuke5> Only 99% of him left to go!
[2:05:01] <+Saggitori> titty typhoon
[2:05:20] <ahaegotrigger> ah yes
[2:06:04] <GunBuster07> sugoiLethargy
[2:06:16] <ferbeholds> wouldnt have it any other way
[2:06:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> that's where my funeral is gonna be
[2:06:43] <Indigoblade> where the drums
[2:06:43] <+FearEngine> I play electric fan personally
[2:06:50] <+tussletoes> these doofuses together probably sound like The Shaggs
[2:06:57] <Chorkly> is this dialogue real.
[2:07:16] <+Saggitori> no they're dead
[2:07:21] <heartlesshealer> "Listen, my best friend's murderer!"
[2:07:27] <JeedyJay> I have a lot of trouble understanding the appeal of Danganronpa games
[2:07:33] <+tussletoes> live laugh love...
[2:07:55] <Chorkly> I always assumed the appeal was being a big brain power fantasy, surrounded by your anime girlfriends.
[2:08:08] <Jjaz_R> Japan has weird sensibilities when it comes to justice.
[2:08:24] <+tussletoes> believe in your own justice
[2:08:26] <+Saggitori> 99% conviction rate
[2:08:32] <TheMoenia> no you have to forgive even the worst atrocities
[2:08:39] <heartlesshealer> Akechi in P5 original
[2:08:39] <Indigoblade> to be fair so does America
[2:08:49] <+tussletoes> america ain't the best at that either yeah
[2:08:55] <+Rutilas9000> I just think they didn't think hard about plot like that since it's anime
[2:09:43] <heartlesshealer> The Lost Forever trope is pretty frustrating, yeah
[2:10:30] <JeedyJay> "The Japanese justice system is terrible in a qualitative way. The American justice system is terrible in a quantitative way. The Chinese justice system is terrible in a Chinese way." - a post I remember from a Something Awful forum
[2:10:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> fitting

[2:14:58] <0rond> https://i.imgur.com/EDykRYI.png
[2:15:01] <Chorkly> she hasn't really got a gymnasts body does she
[2:15:02] <sosuke5> Ibuki won. Don't trust @tussletoes
[2:15:04] <heartlesshealer> the poll finished sio it disappeared
[2:15:12] <heartlesshealer> Ibuki won with Sonia a close second
[2:15:13] <+acridpaladin> it happened
[2:15:20] <+BionTimeWorks2> it showed
[2:15:21] <+tussletoes> Okay jokes aside the poll did work for us just fine
[2:15:23] <TheMoenia> ibuki had 14, sonia had 13
[2:15:26] <Ekaelis> Is there a purpose or few characters have some contradictions in their bios?
[2:15:28] <KnivesEve> ibuki won
[2:15:33] <JeedyJay> FIGHTING, MEAT
[2:15:53] <+tussletoes> He's got that Devilman sprint on him
[2:17:46] <0rond> she seems genuinely nice
[2:17:57] <+not_crabby> id marry ibuki
[2:18:06] <+0ni0n_L0rd> looking at her is annoying
[2:18:09] <0rond> DR2 is filled to the brim with dickwads, not a lot of straight up nice people
[2:18:14] <heartlesshealer> you don't want to rely on her, but she's cool to hang with
[2:18:31] <+not_crabby> clackers are cool
[2:18:41] <+not_crabby> ive broken many
[2:18:53] <+0ni0n_L0rd> i hate everything about her design and gimmick, but she's nice enough
[2:20:13] <+tussletoes> We got some real extra moist cakes in Mexico. Just a thing we do I guess.
[2:20:44] <+tussletoes> Yeah it's a warzone for kids' teeth over here.
[2:20:47] <Jjaz_R> chocolate cake with vanilla ce cream
[2:20:50] <sosuke5> The way god intended
[2:20:55] <+0ni0n_L0rd> same honestly. I'd never buy it, but I'll eat all of it if put in front of me
[2:21:00] <+not_crabby> yes
[2:21:00] <Chorkly> POINTING!
[2:21:03] <Indigoblade> dark chocolate is always a disappointment
[2:21:08] <+not_crabby> but itsalso like 40% spice
[2:21:28] <GeltonZ> She's so proud she turned into a One Piece character
[2:22:41] <sosuke5> Sonia, I guess
[2:22:42] <+0ni0n_L0rd> it's for the best yeah
[2:23:15] <+tussletoes> the final gamer solution...
[2:23:39] <+not_crabby> how dare you ruin the integrity of playing videogames
[2:23:51] <+not_crabby> especially a single player video game
[2:25:09] <0rond> would be cool if she mentions sayaka
[2:25:22] <skelfae> Ann in Persona 5
[2:25:25] <+tussletoes> it's so the xenophobes can dig in too.
[2:25:47] <GeltonZ> UNLESS being the BIG AMERICAN GIRL is the gimmick...because those are my favorite. Nothing better than a girl that screams Engrish at the top of her lungs all the time.
[2:26:10] <Chorkly> Your moonspeak is powerful.
[2:26:44] <heartlesshealer> 80's josei?
[2:26:51] <+0ni0n_L0rd> sounds about right
[2:27:22] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I'm sure the person who does care, cares a whole fucking lot
[2:27:28] <Jjaz_R> sex
[2:27:29] <ProxyWorcanna> Tropes upon tropes.
[2:27:49] <+itsdiss> psaJpeg
[2:28:24] <GunBuster07> sugoiLain
[2:29:24] <GunBuster07> on this character? bleh
[2:29:25] <Jjaz_R> it's okay
[2:29:27] <sosuke5> not my cup of tea
[2:29:28] <+not_crabby> its dumb as fuck
[2:29:28] <ahaegotrigger> I dont like it personally
[2:29:28] <heartlesshealer> I never understood its appeal
[2:29:29] <ferbeholds> rather some stipes
[2:29:31] <ReiDuran> It fits her pop-punk aesthetic
[2:29:31] <+not_crabby> but i like it
[2:29:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> the only part of her design i like
[2:29:37] <horde_of_unicorns> not a fan
[2:29:37] <+itsdiss> not a fan
[2:29:40] <Chorkly> tbf it just makes her look younger, which is a bit creepy imo
[2:29:55] <GunBuster07> top tier anywhere else
[2:29:56] <heartlesshealer> unless you sew hems into the rips, it'd tear itself up every time you wash the clothing, right?
[2:30:12] <JeedyJay> So she's THAT kind of idiot
[2:30:32] <JeedyJay> Oh no
[2:30:33] <ahaegotrigger> oh that kinda shit
[2:30:44] <Steezles> Hagakure?
[2:30:46] <sosuke5> Hiro
[2:30:47] <GeltonZ> MY HOW CONVENIENT!
[2:30:52] <Chorkly> Jesus christ.
[2:31:06] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:31:07] <Jjaz_R> What is it with Japan and underaged schoolgirls?
[2:31:11] <Chorkly> This 16 year old just grew giant tits in two years no shut up it makes sense.
[2:31:23] <Steezles> Hiro wasn't a psycho, he was just really ripped all the time.
[2:32:03] <Nasser_ssbm> LUL
[2:32:03] <ahaegotrigger> man that sounds depressing
[2:32:08] <GunBuster07> sugoiSadguts
[2:32:11] <ahaegotrigger> its spot on though
[2:32:11] <0rond> yeah they are obsessed with youth and innocence
[2:32:25] <+not_crabby> deth
[2:32:33] <ahaegotrigger> Her Chokable throat LUL
[2:32:35] <GunBuster07> dess
[2:32:57] <ahaegotrigger> lmao nice
[2:33:10] <arkv01> lot of neck damage too
[2:33:59] <Ekaelis> Wouldn't she have a Sakura neck from all that headbanging?
[2:34:07] <+dlpchris> sleep meds gave up after an hour, glad someone is up doing things.
[2:34:28] <Chorkly> "If I can fill her loneliness"
[2:34:40] <ahaegotrigger> wow
[2:35:57] <GunBuster07> despacito freeze?
[2:36:08] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:36:20] <Steezles> yakuzas?
[2:36:24] <JeedyJay> Your "anime protagonist" voice there sounds a lot like your Woolie
[2:36:29] <lol_Last> i think so
[2:36:31] <+0ni0n_L0rd> yes
[2:36:40] <GunBuster07> innit for fireworks or some shit
[2:36:40] <heartlesshealer> yukata is one of those summer ones for festivals and stuff
[2:36:42] <+0ni0n_L0rd> they're festival gowns
[2:36:47] <heartlesshealer> probably also in fall
[2:36:51] <GunBuster07> yeah them
[2:37:19] <Chorkly> this isn't a beach, this is a bathtub.
[2:37:24] <Nasser_ssbm> Festival episode
[2:37:49] <JeedyJay> They're tsundere about nationalism
[2:37:56] <Xenioplate> New Zealand
[2:37:57] <Steezles> Nationalism is a means of keeping people in line?
[2:38:17] <tanarath> US, possibly Germany during the 30s?
[2:38:36] <+0ni0n_L0rd> SeemsGood
[2:39:26] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Hajime is a true chad. Working hard for his pals.
[2:39:26] <+acridpaladin> theyre kids. you expect them to be smart?
[2:40:10] <ferbeholds> they are events that happen if you have the item that triggers it i think
[2:40:17] <Steezles> Most easter egg triggered items don't take up a slot of time
[2:42:14] <arkv01> could always kick the door in
[2:42:14] <ferbeholds> to discourage
[2:42:16] <ahaegotrigger> honestly if you have a hammer you have a skeleton key
[2:42:19] <vapidq> I guess that makes sense
[2:43:39] <0rond> actually I'd say it was used like a ladder
[2:43:57] <JeedyJay> Especially if it's a magnetic lock with a fail-state that is "the lock is now permanent."
[2:44:05] <Chorkly> I always imagine these kind of games would be great, if made to your specific culture.
[2:44:24] <0rond> oh yeah
[2:44:28] <+0ni0n_L0rd> yes.
[2:44:29] <0rond> nagato is incredibly popular
[2:44:30] <+Rutilas9000> pretty much
[2:44:31] <Nasser_ssbm> he's super popular yea lol
[2:44:40] <ReiDuran> Nagito fans are weird.
[2:44:47] <0rond> there are people saying every single piece of media has a character like nagato
[2:44:47] <+0ni0n_L0rd> teenage girls LOOOOVE HIM
[2:44:49] <KnivesEve> and you are correct
[2:44:50] <0rond> and honestly they have a point
[2:44:52] <JeedyJay> I suspect that the character art is most is this series' appeal
[2:45:14] <Chorkly> Well I hope the character writing isn't the appeal.
[2:45:26] <+0ni0n_L0rd> handsome
[2:45:36] <+0ni0n_L0rd> none threatening
[2:45:38] <JeedyJay> "I can fix him"
[2:45:50] <+0ni0n_L0rd> but has a darker side
[2:45:54] <KnivesEve> wait her name is Sonia nevermind?
[2:46:05] <MonoReaper> The other part why Nagito is so popular is because his japanese VA is really popular as well
[2:46:10] <Phob05> "How can you be so flippant, yet so desirable?"
[2:46:13] <+itsdiss> "he's pathetic so he won't cheat on me"
[2:46:28] <Darkmega97> this is what the child brains in Revengeance were seeing
[2:46:37] <0rond> btw, nagito's voice actress is the same girl that voices naegi in DR1
[2:46:57] <lettersofsky> this little shit
[2:46:58] <0rond> he about to cup hold nekumaru
[2:47:00] <Darkmega97> the power stance
[2:47:02] <spongeofmystery> Plague is live? Ooooo
[2:47:03] <blackberetguy> lmqao
[2:47:04] <Chorkly> why is his arm so long
[2:47:06] <sosuke5> it'd dat boi
[2:47:07] <blackberetguy> lmao*
[2:47:07] <+0ni0n_L0rd> slap his nuts!
[2:47:11] <ahaegotrigger> hes gonna slap ya in the nuts
[2:47:14] <seth45er> japanese comedian
[2:47:27] <0rond> jiggle nekumaru's bulge
[2:47:39] <ahaegotrigger> how about fu-ck-o-ff
[2:47:43] <lettersofsky> yup
[2:47:46] <a_karmachameleon> oh I finally got to watch plague live
[2:47:52] <MonoReaper> cultural thing yeah
[2:47:56] <0rond> you gotta admit that eyepatch looks good on hin though
[2:47:58] <Darkmega97> cupping a man's balls is a sign of great respect in japanese culture
[2:47:59] <JeedyJay> I wish they'd just commit to the "surname first" thing. I hate having to figure out if they switched it around for the translation
[2:48:08] <a_karmachameleon> jojo?
[2:48:09] <GunBuster07> on a guy shimas
[2:48:14] <Indigoblade> he looks like a femboy
[2:48:28] <0rond> more like a fuccboi
[2:48:32] <+0ni0n_L0rd> sounds like something she would do
[2:48:36] <a_karmachameleon> so what is this game.
[2:48:43] <a_karmachameleon> about?
[2:48:50] <Ekaelis> Thanks Hiyoko
[2:48:54] <GunBuster07> SOOO DA?
[2:48:59] <0rond> she WAS extra close to mahiru
[2:49:12] <Chorkly> damn, not Pekora as well
[2:49:25] <JeedyJay> They say it a lot, actually. They just don't mean it the way you or I would
[2:50:04] <JeedyJay> I mean, we really just dropped those bombs because we couldn't let the war end without flexing at the Soviets
[2:50:26] <spongeofmystery> Invites a kicking, certainly
[2:50:26] <+acridpaladin> start kicking him in the ribs while hes down
[2:50:27] <GunBuster07> they'd be called inane
[2:50:38] <a_karmachameleon> ThankEgg
[2:50:46] <blackberetguy> yes, you will
[2:50:52] <spongeofmystery> @corrosivePaladin great minds think alike
[2:50:57] <arkv01> whoa
[2:50:59] <+not_crabby> oh shit
[2:51:00] <MonoReaper> He did it
[2:51:02] <lettersofsky> blood
[2:51:04] <a_karmachameleon> forgot that was even an emote ThankEgg
[2:51:06] <KnivesEve> hiyoko seems like a very smart gal
[2:51:08] <Darkmega97> it's his semen
[2:51:09] <blackberetguy> pee is pink in danga?
[2:51:09] <+not_crabby> he peed really hard
[2:51:12] <Chorkly> Oh no, not the pink bloodline technique.
[2:51:13] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:51:15] <Ekaelis> leave him to bleed out now LUL
[2:51:22] <lol_Last> xd
[2:51:26] <Darkmega97> blood ain't pink ya bimbo
[2:51:27] <MonoReaper> Yeah he stabbed himself
[2:51:28] <seth45er> gonna cry? piss your pants? Shit and cum?
[2:51:33] <MonoReaper> the seppuku thing i believe
[2:51:34] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:51:34] <+acridpaladin> nice
[2:51:38] <horde_of_unicorns> let him die
[2:51:38] <0rond> imagine if piss is also bright pink in the danganronpa universe, "oh no! this person is passed out with a bunch of piss all over him! gross!"
[2:51:40] <lettersofsky> I will bleed all over your food so you forgive me
[2:51:55] <a_karmachameleon> is it pink story wise or pink because censorship?
[2:52:01] <GunBuster07> HE'S SO DETERMINED AND STOIC
[2:52:01] <+acridpaladin> censorship
[2:52:07] <MonoReaper> they made it pink because of age ratings
[2:52:12] <ReiDuran> Does anyone else think the concept of seppuku is just fucking stupid
[2:52:13] <KnivesEve> aw come on can you at least bleed outside the dining room
[2:52:13] <ferbeholds> just more work for mikan
[2:52:14] <+KevinsLunchbox> his car keys
[2:52:15] <Chorkly> japanese guts
[2:52:17] <Maleicus> hidden butter knife
[2:52:18] <a_karmachameleon> willpower to bleed out.
[2:52:18] <+acridpaladin> japan cant handle blood so they use funny colors
[2:52:20] <Darkmega97> he flexed really hard
[2:52:25] <GunBuster07> thought this was the guy with the sword wound already
[2:52:26] <0rond> he ripped his tummy out with his bare hand like fucking chad
[2:52:33] <a_karmachameleon> the ultimate you didn't win!
[2:52:49] <a_karmachameleon> oh NVM he's still alive.
[2:52:50] <Phob05> "trouble"
[2:52:54] <spongeofmystery> Just fucking do it properly and spare everyone your stupidity
[2:52:56] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:53:15] <Chorkly> Oh, hello breasts.
[2:53:32] <lettersofsky> it's all just bones
[2:53:33] <blackberetguy> ah yees bones
[2:53:37] <Maleicus> yeah, and?
[2:53:43] <TheMoenia> the candles are made out of tallow i bet
[2:53:44] <0rond> yeah they are just shaped like bones
[2:53:46] <+acridpaladin> it bothers me they arent mirrored
[2:53:58] <+KevinsLunchbox> they went to the halloween shop
[2:54:26] <JeedyJay> You don't say
[2:54:35] <+Rutilas9000> anime logic is rarely realistic
[2:54:48] <0rond> chiyaki is cute
[2:54:51] <+KevinsLunchbox> twilight sparkle danganropa girl
[2:54:52] <+acridpaladin> the horse skipped breakfast?
[2:54:52] <arkv01> but it do tickle the brain
[2:54:53] <a_karmachameleon> maybe she made a silicone mold of the bone.
[2:55:08] <spongeofmystery> Akane quiettVaporlove
[2:55:35] <a_karmachameleon> is this natural vs nurture discussion?
[2:56:10] <+not_crabby> !uptime
[2:56:11] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 56 minutes 23 seconds
[2:56:18] <Chorkly> I imagine it's just showing the proper emotion.
[2:56:30] <Chorkly> Wait did they just eat without cleaning up the blood.
[2:56:36] <+KevinsLunchbox> did you know the cult that did the subway attack also tried to build a nuclear bomb
[2:56:44] <blackberetguy> some behaviour is like they're sstill in medieval ages
[2:56:48] <blackberetguy> same*
[2:56:55] <Samex_Comex> Hello
[2:56:56] <a_karmachameleon> @chorkly ugh Tuesday am I right?
[2:57:04] <+Axellogic> stick it in save slot
[2:57:39] <a_karmachameleon> so how's everyone's day going so far?
[2:58:16] <a_karmachameleon> this game is all over the place, how can I play this?
[2:58:31] <0rond> c h i y a k i
[2:58:42] <Indigoblade> what happens if you let the despair meter get to 10
[2:58:48] <+0ni0n_L0rd> No love for hello nurse
[2:58:57] <a_karmachameleon> "titty typhoon"?
[2:58:58] <Maleicus> it obviously dies
[3:00:09] <+not_crabby> thats a descent name for a song
[3:00:12] <+not_crabby> tbh
[3:00:22] <Maleicus> no its not
[3:00:28] <+not_crabby> shut up yes it is
[3:00:38] <ahaegotrigger> she is a teenage emo girl to a T
[3:01:13] <Phob05> emo I thought she was punk?
[3:01:17] <0rond> she isn't actually emo at all though, she is cheerful as fuck
[3:01:23] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I've known more than one grown ass woman like Ibuki, it's one of the reasons i finds her annoying
[3:01:40] <a_karmachameleon> maybe she's nu metal.
[3:02:28] <jac0f1> people are so mean to fictional characters...
[3:03:03] <+0ni0n_L0rd> if we can't be mean to fictional girls, who can we be mean too?
[3:03:11] <+Axellogic> But did you know he liked 2d anime waifus?
[3:04:08] <arkv01> thanks shia
[3:04:14] <+0ni0n_L0rd> not real women, I'm not trying to get canceled
[3:04:23] <ReiDuran> To be fair, they are teenagers
[3:04:30] <ReiDuran> so it's not like they're even complete people yet
[3:04:57] <a_karmachameleon> what's replayability of this game is it random or is it linear on who the killer is?
[3:05:05] <Samex_Comex> Yay your married
[3:05:22] <Maleicus> linear
[3:05:31] <Nasser_ssbm> LUL

[3:07:28] <+0ni0n_L0rd> what about the hips!
[3:07:30] <+Axellogic> just write the same word thats what everyone successful does
[3:07:35] <filialpails> lucidity
[3:07:57] <MightyPsychoBat> Did that card say her chest was 35inchs
[3:08:27] <ahaegotrigger> yes
[3:08:32] <Chorkly> she's got 3feet wide breasts, despite being 5'2
[3:08:32] <MightyPsychoBat> are her tits like three feet long?
[3:08:41] <Chorkly> her poor poor back
[3:08:51] <jac0f1> i think its circumference for her breast size

[3:11:00] <Chorkly> Jesus that monkey was massive.
[3:11:13] <Glasphemy> if you press x on the poll then it goes back to the "gift a sub" menu is what I meant
[3:11:16] <+Axellogic> But they're so dramatic

[3:13:42] <justianxix> and then she will fall over again
[3:13:48] <+acridpaladin> i doubt it
[3:13:59] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[3:14:03] <+acridpaladin> i assume she'll just remain a cardboard cutout

[3:21:54] <a_karmachameleon> well at least you lived party
[3:22:16] <0rond> i'm pretty sure titty typhoon is unchanged from japanese
[3:22:18] <filialpails> it is titty typhoon in japanese, it's a reference to the titty twister in from dusk til dawn
[3:22:47] <+acridpaladin> whats wrong with a good titty murder?
[3:22:56] <a_karmachameleon> wait was it actually called that in dusk til dawn?
[3:23:02] <ferbeholds> nightime is good
[3:23:21] <+Rutilas9000> imagine being murdered by titties
[3:24:15] <Samex_Comex> It reminds me of From Dusk to dawn
[3:25:09] <0rond> he had spares
[3:25:11] <+Rutilas9000> multiple suits?
[3:25:15] <a_karmachameleon> this just in a stripper named jade smothered her clients by holding him into her chest for a little too long the victim actually died with a smile.
[3:25:20] <Maleicus> they have spares
[3:25:21] <justianxix> who doesn't have spares
[3:25:39] <Maleicus> monokuma supplied them
[3:25:41] <Maleicus> ez

[3:28:57] <haydenthygreat> its the glory of the scene
[3:28:57] <Maleicus> chart topping song
[3:29:09] <Jjaz_R> It's pretty bad
[3:29:15] <+Rutilas9000> starting to wonder why she spilt from the group
[3:29:22] <Samex_Comex> Mosh pit!

[3:36:29] <lettersofsky> he earned them
[3:36:42] <Jjaz_R> fair enough
[3:37:03] <Samex_Comex> I thought maybe they could be whiskers because his name has Neko in it maybe?
[3:37:17] <+Rutilas9000> where?
[3:37:21] <+0ni0n_L0rd> The nipple is SUPER THICC

[3:39:05] <Ekaelis> The logic went out the window right in the prologue
[3:39:32] <MonoReaper> In Despair Girls you actually fight mass produces Monokuma robots

[3:41:03] <Ekaelis> Didn't Monokuma have to be convinced to enforce his own rule in order to save Fuyuhiko?
[3:41:03] <Asdings> he sacrificed his crotch

[3:42:09] <+not_crabby> she really sounds distressed
[3:42:35] <+not_crabby> wow
[3:42:49] <+not_crabby> truly unsurvivable
[3:42:52] <Ekaelis> Quick, shoot her now, not sure how him getting in front and taking the shot somehow absolves her
[3:42:59] <Meepminer> He's bleeding from his mouth and his head
[3:43:07] <+Holmborn> same
[3:43:15] <MonoReaper> I remember he had a gigant hole in his body but maybe that was censored
[3:43:17] <+mercurylev> Say, what's Plague's take on Soda? I missed the last stream

[3:50:32] <ReiDuran> I've lost control of my life
[3:50:33] <lettersofsky> it's only 10pm here
[3:50:33] <justianxix> why not

[3:50:39] <lettersofsky> yeah
[3:50:40] <KnivesEve> 4am here
[3:50:40] <Meepminer> Also why this guy?
[3:50:40] <gnollAUS> Can confirm Australian
[3:50:41] <+Axellogic> I mean im usually streaming now
[3:50:45] <+mercurylev> Even worse, East Coasters
[3:50:46] <grexo12> Were such dirty boys....
[3:50:46] <spongeofmystery> Kiwis
[3:50:49] <tubit> kiwis
[3:50:49] <gnollAUS> Kiwies
[3:50:49] <+Axellogic> but noone watches me so I will watch you
[3:50:49] <Chorkly> Kiwis
[3:50:51] <+not_crabby> kiwis
[3:50:51] <+itsdiss> I work nights, these are my regular awake hours.
[3:50:51] <Fenlig> Strawberrys
[3:50:51] <lettersofsky> kiwis
[3:50:52] <bettysharkface> Kiwis
[3:50:52] <theloganbrand> Kiwi
[3:50:55] <+LucentHolic> kiwis
[3:50:56] <seth45er> Hobbits
[3:50:59] <+not_crabby> hobbits
[3:51:15] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:51:18] <bettysharkface> It's not
[3:51:19] <dodgy_dingo_> In Australia we call Americans 'seppos'
[3:51:23] <bettysharkface> They're kiwis
[3:51:30] <Fenlig> Uruk hai
[3:51:30] <+Axellogic> but Kiwi's are cute
[3:51:32] <seth45er> its white and the native are maori
[3:51:35] <Chorkly> maori
[3:51:39] <filialpails> maori are the indigenous people
[3:51:44] <bettysharkface> The maori tend to be called islanders
[3:51:46] <Meepminer> I know it's hard to imagine yourself in this situation but I don't think Hajime's being overdramatic
[3:51:48] <spongeofmystery> Kiwi is like "Limey" for Brits
[3:51:55] <bettysharkface> But they're all kiwis
[3:51:56] <Chorkly> However maori's are also Kiwi's. There's a bit of a history of oppression there though.
[3:51:58] <0rond> it's 13:00 on an election day here
[3:51:59] <dodgy_dingo_> Limey is funny though
[3:52:13] <Chorkly> Didn't get it as bad as the aboriginals, but they didn't get it good.
[3:52:20] <bettysharkface> Ye
[3:52:21] <Fenlig> I think Maori is the plural
[3:52:33] <grexo12> why are you streaming in the middle of night though?
[3:52:40] <Xenioplate> Yes, everyone falls under 'kiwi' if you basically live here
[3:52:42] <minon981> the Kiwi is a native bird, so if you're native to NZ you're a kiwi, if you're a part of the ethinic group, you're a moari
[3:52:55] <spongeofmystery> Kiwi's a nickname, right? Like Yankee
[3:53:05] <Xenioplate> Pretty much yea
[3:53:11] <dodgy_dingo_> Kiwis do good wines
[3:53:21] <bettysharkface> Kiwis call themselves kiwis too
[3:53:23] <filialpails> after the bird
[3:53:23] <Maleicus> because its funny
[3:53:25] <seth45er> its a native bird
[3:53:30] <+mercurylev> Naw its the bird
[3:53:33] <lettersofsky> cause the birds are native there
[3:53:35] <seth45er> Kiwi bird
[3:53:40] <arkv01> the fruit bird
[3:53:45] <lettersofsky> nope
[3:53:46] <Chorkly> Funny native bird. In face due to how New Zealand came about, all their native mammals are birds.
[3:53:47] <lettersofsky> that's it
[3:53:50] <minon981> nope, that's it
[3:53:54] <Xenioplate> Fucking nope
[3:53:55] <spongeofmystery> Or like Canada, which is a native word for something like "this place"
[3:54:08] <tubit> it's because kiwis resemble hobbits
[3:54:14] <bettysharkface> Kiwis are Kiwis and Aussies are Aussies.
[3:54:17] <rabidvampy> Oh this place, our home and native land
[3:54:37] <Samex_Comex> Dose that make Americans Eagles or Turkeys
[3:54:44] <grexo12> Danganronpa is murder story shitpost simulator.
[3:54:58] <TheMoenia> the tears on her boobs look very interesting
[3:54:59] <+0ni0n_L0rd> There you go
[3:55:01] <+0ni0n_L0rd> Two takes
[3:55:12] <dodgy_dingo_> I thought you were fried chickens?
[3:55:34] <minon981> look, it white americans were called turkeys and native americans went by their various ethnic names, it'd probably be better
[3:55:34] <+Rutilas9000> right
[3:55:40] <grexo12> Stop crying or il cry.
[3:55:46] <+0ni0n_L0rd> They're already wet with tears.
[3:55:48] <haydenthygreat> bitties

[4:06:23] <bettysharkface> Like whatever little logic is left might as well not exist...
[4:07:20] <sosuke5> A lot of the motives for 2 feel off.
[4:07:21] <Chorkly> what an amazing narrative
[4:07:34] <0rond> that was the plot of DR 1 though, that may not be the reason for this killing game
[4:07:34] <Ekaelis> Motivation would be like putting a loaded gun on a table, this feels like giving someone a gun and then force them to fire
[4:07:39] <heartlesshealer> "writing is my passion"
[4:07:42] <blackberetguy> damn chat is roasting the game :(

[4:16:03] <+Axellogic> I can attest
[4:16:19] <+Axellogic> It took forever to get it right
[4:16:22] <+Axellogic> when I made one
[4:16:22] <Chorkly> I thought suicide was very Japanese
[4:16:36] <cyber_weeb> this brat seems very sus
[4:17:20] <minon981> even a preschooler understands the cultural origins of quarantine in black-death era spain
[4:17:22] <KELTHUZAD9999> but there is no way to stop the insects so monokuma screw them all
[4:17:44] <cyber_weeb> this isn't anime, this danganronpa
[4:17:46] <TheAntiNihilist> because you are all infected
[4:18:06] <Maleicus> he was lying
[4:18:07] <Maleicus> ez
[4:18:41] <KELTHUZAD9999> but is nagito, in no moment is his word trusty

[4:31:54] <ReiDuran> depends on your stance on abortion
[4:31:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Do I
[4:31:56] <+mercurylev> Monokuma is probably a "life begins at birth" kinda guy
[4:31:57] <skelfae> what about conjoined twins?
[4:31:57] <MightyPsychoBat> He is a demonic teddy bear why would he give a shit?
[4:32:02] <Ekaelis> Double kill?

[4:44:54] <+comedianonfire> I had it much much earlier though
[4:45:18] <108Sins> looks like 2003 avril lavigne
[4:45:52] <+comedianonfire> Teru Teru intensifies

[4:50:38] <$Bigchill___> what if plague was a grill?
[4:50:52] <grexo12> What if plague was fake
[4:51:16] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:51:19] <minon981> never dismis the idea of brain worms piloting someones corpse
[4:51:21] <+reiface08> what if someone dies from the disease, does that mean monokuma has to save them?
[4:51:24] <Pixel_Butts> what if plague was a cat
[4:51:28] <+reiface08> or before it gets to the point
[4:51:51] <kylecoolperson> good morning everyone
[4:52:00] <grexo12> cool melodrama.
[4:52:04] <+comedianonfire> lol
[4:52:16] <+Milpool> that's basically Juri
[4:52:47] <grexo12> Hes fake
[4:52:56] <0rond> I don't think it's meant to be funny, I think it's meant to be creepy/morbid
[4:52:57] <seth45er> where are the Viper nurses?
[4:53:33] <0rond> hey plague did you ever play aviary attorney?
[4:53:47] <grexo12> In danganronpa anyone can be gay.
[4:53:50] <minon981> definatly feel like akane could be the next corpse
[4:54:10] <Indigoblade> why's she crying?
[4:54:14] <Samex_Comex> plagueImoya
[4:54:15] <blackberetguy> is he deas yet
[4:54:18] <blackberetguy> dead*
[4:54:20] <MightyPsychoBat> So does this illness make them turn into opposites?
[4:54:26] <spongeofmystery> Akane, the Kefla of the game
[4:54:32] <minon981> mikan's design is more complex though
[4:54:34] <0rond> this disease gave ibuki a hotness buff too
[4:54:44] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> I love your work. At least all that I've seen.
[4:55:09] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[4:55:12] <pyjama_day> between Aoi in 1 and Akane in this, i think i have a type.
[4:55:14] <ahaegotrigger> thats the spirit
[4:55:17] <blackberetguy> so many flags
[4:55:24] <grexo12> "Takeing care" of him
[4:55:49] <grexo12> Or she will kill
[4:56:01] <Indigoblade> AMOGUS
[4:56:22] <0rond> ultimate high school level amogus
[4:56:28] <+comedianonfire> I have my doubts about Fuyuhiko going rogue lytLURK
[4:57:47] <minon981> it's a good christmas crool
[4:57:54] <blackberetguy> this is a slow chapter isnt it?
[4:57:55] <minon981> carrol
[4:58:20] <blackberetguy> no bullyin
[4:58:37] <+comedianonfire> You can be a plank and still come to hope's peak guys! lytAWW
[4:59:11] <MonoReaper> Hopes Peak allowed regular folk to attend for a certain entrance "fee"
[4:59:23] <blackberetguy> yeah, i mean who pays for tuition right
[4:59:24] <minon981> " it;s almost like he's a perfect genericly relatable protagonist with no outstanding or characterisitic qualities"
[5:00:27] <blackberetguy> wtf
[5:00:27] <+comedianonfire> Epic Fail! lytNOTIKETHIS

[5:01:42] <0rond> #WORTH
[5:01:55] <jojpart7> WTF DIS I SEE
[5:02:16] <0rond> wait plague did you get the shower scene in the previous chapter?
[5:02:22] <filialpails> lying down allows it to pool
[5:02:29] <+comedianonfire> the clashing powers of 2D sprite designs and splasharts
[5:03:31] <Samex_Comex> Only one I remember is with photo girl and goblin
[5:03:34] <0rond> there's a missable CG of mahiru and hiyoko showering
[5:04:04] <0rond> and it doesn't leave a lot for the imagination
[5:04:13] <spongeofmystery> So he's a Malkavian now
[5:05:03] <blackberetguy> she horni
[5:05:11] <ZiggySol> On the other hand, she's an anime girl
[5:05:32] <+comedianonfire> Translation: No please stay! I love you Hajime!
[5:05:33] <minon981> i mean, look man, you ever been a real slut for sleep? times when i'd sleep on any bed, regardless of who else was in there
[5:05:35] <Maleicus> but hes still lying
[5:05:58] <seth45er> oh  my god nothing is happening...
[5:06:07] <seth45er> make it go faster!
[5:06:18] <seth45er> oh finally
[5:06:19] <blackberetguy> crap
[5:06:26] <ZiggySol> A murder??? Who could have forseen this?
[5:06:29] <blackberetguy> a noose? wtf
[5:06:34] <tukds> titty typhoon
[5:06:35] <spongeofmystery> "Ritual"
[5:06:36] <minon981> is that a ladder or a stepladder?
[5:06:38] <+comedianonfire> Music Venue?
[5:06:43] <seth45er> yes a ritual with a noose.
[5:07:36] <Maleicus> ice is very important
[5:07:39] <blackberetguy> snuff film?
[5:07:54] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Hello Eli it is good to hear your voice again
[5:07:56] <+comedianonfire> aaaand the lights went off at a perfect timing
[5:08:58] <Maleicus> why would they be there
[5:09:00] <Maleicus> how silly
[5:09:13] <Jjaz_R> No one alive, you mean.
[5:09:33] <+comedianonfire> Kazuichi?
[5:09:33] <tukds> Get ready for the most obvious trial in the game
[5:09:55] <blackberetguy> boy do i have a lot
[5:09:57] <Hugsloth> Titty Typhoon: great for birthday parties
[5:10:27] <ahaegotrigger> HOT AIR
[5:10:56] <+comedianonfire> I think everybody is at the motel right now hmmm
[5:11:08] <ahaegotrigger> id want to get her off Kreygasm
[5:11:11] <Maleicus> he needed help
[5:11:15] <blackberetguy> lmao imagine
[5:11:20] <ahaegotrigger> he had a chair right there
[5:11:42] <+Rutilas9000> whoever that was is definitely dead now
[5:12:08] <Maleicus> they were probably already dead really
[5:12:22] <+comedianonfire> pffffft
[5:12:23] <tukds> it needs to be even more needlessly convoluted
[5:12:23] <minon981> But why do thing, when can talk about doing thing instead?
[5:12:32] <Samsaz> probably still warm...
[5:12:37] <blackberetguy> nice
[5:13:00] <blackberetguy> both waifus dead? oh no
[5:13:01] <tukds> This series is hyper formulaic
[5:13:13] <+comedianonfire> He literally said not to ask
[5:13:52] <minon981> hey, maybe it someone from off the island, could be possible
[5:14:25] <Hugsloth> Nanaki Best Girl
[5:14:39] <grexo12> Damn right hes half a man
[5:14:48] <+comedianonfire> damn bro
[5:15:21] <Hugsloth> >liking Saionji
[5:15:22] <minon981> duo murdera
[5:15:25] <+comedianonfire> Hiyoko is the ded scottfRunitback
[5:15:43] <0rond> watch akane's body be in the back room
[5:15:53] <ducellion> liking hiyoko is  pretty based
[5:15:58] <+comedianonfire> nah, no three murders allowed
[5:16:26] <+zepelinnn1> "in this case it didnt"
[5:16:26] <dirtyh4rr1> correct
[5:16:28] <+Rutilas9000> yes
[5:16:35] <+reiface08> aren't there four of you?
[5:16:35] <+not_crabby> no he said in that specfic one that wasnt the case
[5:17:05] <+not_crabby> ah
[5:17:13] <branmuffinss> :(
[5:17:15] <minon981> i mean, i've only been here for like an hour or two, i'm only here to be a twitch chat dumbas
[5:17:35] <Hugsloth> Ibuki's Pathways Kreygasm
[5:18:13] <@Nightbot> @tukds -> I'm only trying to help. [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[5:18:14] <minon981> i totally called ibuki though
[5:18:15] <+tokenreefer> hey plague, I've recently started getting into drawing. I got the anatomy basics, I've been just having trouble rendering, what should I be working on to get better, I've probably been at it for 4 months or so
[5:18:16] <Luizabd> oh yeah theres four
[5:18:23] <tukds> ...
[5:18:28] <+comedianonfire> Should we tell him, chat?
[5:18:29] <Jjaz_R> Are there actually different paths or are all deaths unavoidable?
[5:18:38] <Maleicus> unavoidable
[5:18:40] <Sal0k> Don't put this image into my brain man, how dare you ?
[5:19:36] <blackberetguy> yea she probably suffocated not snapped.. he could have saved her probs
[5:20:17] <+reiface08> iirc doing a double murder doesn't benefit someone over a single right?
[5:20:27] <Maleicus> it doesnt no
[5:20:50] <minon981> I do like the titty sign in the background though
[5:20:55] <+comedianonfire> Translation is rough on Danganronpa. The first game had a lot of weird lines and sequences too.
[5:20:56] <tukds> Did you forget the prologue?
[5:21:11] <0rond> double murders are woolieFUN
[5:21:44] <+comedianonfire> He is just regular crazy now Hooray!
[5:22:07] <grexo12> TITTY TYPHOON?
[5:22:37] <j0gurtddd> yep
[5:22:39] <0rond> they do end up explaining it at the end though
[5:22:43] <blackberetguy> we ran out of motives so.....
[5:22:47] <tukds> ...
[5:22:48] <0rond> for all those types of answers
[5:23:08] <+comedianonfire> Eh, I dislike the despair disease as a concept
[5:23:31] <ZiggySol> Someone is sus
[5:23:48] <tukds> It's almost like this is your second playthrough
[5:23:57] <+Milpool> they really do naviCulture
[5:24:09] <0rond> her left booba looks bigger than her right booba though
[5:24:36] <Indigoblade> good boobas
[5:24:37] <minon981> i mean. i like the idea of 'let's set up these character personality, then flip it and see what happens's but i think tha'ts be ebtter as like, a whole concept, not something abandoned so quickly
[5:24:41] <HollowBeansVG> if you mean her right one and our left one it's closer to the screen
[5:25:02] <Chorkly> I was gone for a bit, who just died?
[5:25:07] <+comedianonfire> Nagito would be the closest to Byakuya
[5:25:10] <0rond> byakuya was the byakuya
[5:25:13] <Maleicus> but there was literal byakyu fat
[5:25:31] <+comedianonfire> lol true
[5:25:43] <minon981> "it's so hot, guess we better start stripping"
[5:25:59] <Samex_Comex> There goes the harem :(
[5:26:01] <Chorkly> oh no, those are bad deaths
[5:26:10] <+comedianonfire> No sign of murder weapon for Hiyoko btw
[5:26:16] <Sal0k> Slit throat is very slow  and painful ...
[5:26:27] <+Milpool> unless its like a guillotine
[5:26:34] <dirtyh4rr1> "because it's act 3!"
[5:27:03] <+comedianonfire> scottfDisgust scottfDisgust scottfDisgust
[5:27:14] <Sal0k> @Milpool It's decapitation in that case
[5:27:19] <Samex_Comex> I think Ibuki was told to do it
[5:28:42] <Jjaz_R> When are you streaming agan?
[5:28:43] <tukds> a top streamer
[5:29:02] <HollowBeansVG> Lance is playing that game you hate
[5:29:08] <Maleicus> why are you streaming at this time of day
