[0:05:27] <+mythology333> When I watched the show with my brother, 3 episodes in he said he wanted more Yordles in the show, more than Heimer and the "Whoredle"
[0:05:52] <%Spadoinkle> I gave Paige money.
[0:06:02] <%Spadoinkle> You giggled at my name then too.
[0:06:03] <+mythology333> I told him there was 1 more. He got hyped for Ziggs. Then the gimp yordle came up, he wasn't happy
[0:06:34] <%TheGenieA1> have you gotten a sub from DoomerGothBigMommyMilkers yet

[0:07:08] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah, the only two with speaking roles where the council member and and the prostitute. And the prostitute was played for a "ha ha she's old" gag. it was weird.
[0:07:11] <%TheGenieA1> plagueTaps
[0:07:11] <%Spadoinkle> Thanks for remembering my dumb name.
[0:07:15] <%Waffle_Stache> There is no music on our side just so you know

[0:08:07] <%JoshManVGH> This is my first time hearing the sub sound and it's making me chortle
[0:08:36] <+SkookumHime> hi Plague skooku2Wave
[0:08:36] <%boatzndhoez> did you finish it?
[0:09:03] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah. It is super well crafted too.
[0:09:24] <+KingKrampus> this music sounds like FF9 does Alice in Wonderland
[0:09:46] <%Waffle_Stache> Music is a tad too loud
[0:09:50] <+SkookumHime> music overpowers your voice a little
[0:10:29] <+Quea> Getting 40cm of snow tonight
[0:10:48] <JacklongKondur> now im sad
[0:11:05] <Samex_Comex> We got a lot of snow too
[0:11:32] <JacklongKondur> <.< can i have some
[0:11:50] <+SkookumHime> I want snow
[0:11:53] <JacklongKondur> snow that is
[0:11:53] <%JoshManVGH> That's a lot of snow!
[0:12:18] <JohnClaggart> music is a tad too orchestral

[0:12:41] <+Quea> Perks of living in Canada
[0:12:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Evening @PlagueOfGripes and pals
[0:13:00] <+wizard_of_diamonds> This song sounds familiar, what is it?
[0:13:34] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh I see now LUL
[0:13:45] <%JovianGargoyle> Journey?
[0:14:03] <%JoshManVGH> I'm near Canada and we're getting like 10cm tonight. Only to get rained away Saturday...
[0:14:05] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Yep
[0:14:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I love how the vtuber tracker treats you looking up as you freaking out LUL
[0:14:42] <+Quea> Know where I live it’ll all be rained away
[0:14:49] <+Quea> Knowing
[0:15:05] <%octotasty> rigging is hard
[0:15:28] <JohnClaggart> rigging isnt hard, making facial animations 1-1 with movement is
[0:15:34] <%JoshManVGH> The eye tracking looks like it would be a pain to account for.
[0:16:09] <%octotasty> gotta make garbage until you have no more garbage to make, then you start making good stuff.
[0:16:30] <+MADDKATT> Hello little plague Cat, What adventure you on today?
[0:17:13] <+kachucho> sup plaguey, can we ger your thoughts on arcane?
[0:17:16] <+kachucho> pretty pls??
[0:18:01] <JohnClaggart> the arcane style is too clean
[0:18:19] <+MADDKATT> I noticed in most of the offical art for arcane. Their artist really liked drawing her face kinda facing down but looking up.
[0:18:21] <+kachucho> arcane is french animation isn't it? makes sense to be clean af
[0:18:53] <+kachucho> arcane video opinion Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:18:55] <JohnClaggart> it reminds me of how they did "the walking dead" games
[0:19:35] <JohnClaggart> where the comic is scratchy as hell but the game is cell shaded
[0:19:38] <$teddygrahams82> am watching earserhead in dreams
[0:19:50] <%octotasty> Arcane can't be good enough for me to forget my vitriolic hate for League for even a second.
[0:20:41] <+kachucho> @octotasty i just can't understand why everyone is in that game but powder wtf
[0:20:50] <$teddygrahams82> David lynch is f  up lol
[0:21:04] <%octotasty> Powder?
[0:21:12] <%SilverRoddo> 🧠 bahaPwetty
[0:21:37] <+kachucho> you know the flat and crazy loli?
[0:21:44] <JohnClaggart> no ones ever really gone
[0:21:55] <+MADDKATT> She slowly being the flagship character now.
[0:21:56] <Tracazoid> The Harley Quinn Paradox
[0:21:57] <%octotasty> I left League before Jinx even released
[0:22:48] <%JoshManVGH> Huh, looks like it is a French studio behind it, and they did also do the KDA Popstars video
[0:22:51] <+kachucho> suicide squad never got to explain why a crazy lady with a bat was more important for a superhuman team than anything else.
[0:22:52] <+MADDKATT> Will become "have you heard of League?" "OH the one with jinx in it"
[0:23:16] <+kachucho> same goes for jinx, in a game with literal gods
[0:23:34] <+jorgamund> @kachucho even super secret black ops teams make concessions for marketing
[0:23:37] <JohnClaggart> plague, did you ever check out the nier raid content?
[0:23:52] <%JoshManVGH> Is it because the LoL playerbase thinks they are all "We live in a society" crazed damaged genius?
[0:24:45] <+kachucho> if riot games manages to create a decent mmorpg like they promised it would be awesome
[0:25:28] <%octotasty> @kachucho even better would be for them to spend unreasonable amounts of cash in it just for it to flop, killing the company.
[0:25:37] <%JoshManVGH> How would the concept of "lanes" be incorporated in an MMO combat system?
[0:26:22] <%JoshManVGH> or rather "how could"
[0:26:25] <+TaylOctopus91> That looks like Jinx from the hit Netflix series Arcane!! 🤩🤩
[0:26:25] <+kachucho> @octotasty hard to flop a company owned by tencent. also kda skins are funding the next 5 years of future projects atpRtsd4 atpRtsd4
[0:26:47] <%octotasty> oh right, I forgot about tencent.
[0:26:56] <+TaylOctopus91> Mmm, nipple cloth
[0:27:09] <+kachucho> @tayloctopus91 powder* Kappa
[0:28:03] <+TaylOctopus91> @kachucho Pow-Pow with her buddy Fishbones!
[0:28:33] <JohnClaggart> i wonder if they ever fixed hydration bot
[0:29:32] <NetherTable> we doing a little powder/jinx drawing?
[0:30:07] <Samex_Comex> Hydration bot was so busy making sure everyone else was hydrated they forgot to hydrate them selves
[0:30:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Who is this supposed to be?
[0:30:31] <+2muchshroomsmarisa> i can't believe hydration bot is dead...
[0:30:45] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:30:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Is it one of those League of Legends?
[0:30:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The kids are into?
[0:31:02] <+kachucho> hydration bot analyzed the water for safety reasons. found a couple of weird substances
[0:31:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Aw yeah, Jinx is a League of Legend :)
[0:31:20] <+kachucho> he issued a report to the fda and was found dead 2 days later
[0:31:35] <JohnClaggart> yet
[0:31:38] <NetherTable> yeah it's genuinely sad at points in the show
[0:32:00] <+kachucho> poor powder, must suck to suck at life, huh?
[0:32:52] <NetherTable> as the old saying goes, when you use a molotov to solve your problems you almost always have a new problem
[0:32:54] <%JoshManVGH> But the catalyst was a "One Bad Day" scenario.
[0:32:59] <+kachucho> it's like that bike meme where the dude makes himself trip with a stick
[0:33:31] <%SilverRoddo> She’s a better Bennet? bitterClap
[0:33:56] <+kachucho> imagine a horror short clip with jhin Kreygasm Kreygasm
[0:34:01] <+kachucho> too much potential
[0:34:07] <%JoshManVGH> Fucked around and found out.
[0:34:30] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> Cant believe we poop out our butts
[0:34:56] <%SilverRoddo> bitterTears 🎹

[0:35:17] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> LanceCorpralScottBukake gifted a Tier 1 sub to VizierTempus! 
[0:35:28] <+kachucho> nah he is trash ingame but his lore is cool.
[0:35:34] <+TaylOctopus91> This song... The nostalgia... Such feels
[0:35:39] <%SilverRoddo> bitterDab bitterDab bitterDab
[0:35:59] <+kachucho> he's an assassin with an obsession with the number 4 and sees his work as art
[0:36:11] <%VizierTempus> @LanceCorpralScottBukake Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:36:29] <Samex_Comex> People cake and down it with some people milk
[0:36:33] <+kachucho> more like a serial killer and every time he speaks to himself there's a choir.
[0:36:45] <%JoshManVGH> So he's like that one episode of Psycho Pass?
[0:36:52] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> Was that what the genocide was @plagueofgripes
[0:37:14] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> In dbz
[0:37:15] <%SilverRoddo> I can’t believe Vegeta got any with mass murder that one time in the stadium
[0:37:20] <%JoshManVGH> Or that one villian in Evil Within 2?
[0:38:16] <LVL1_Scumbag> How'd that turn out?
[0:38:38] <+kachucho> i wonder if there's an afterlife in naruto as clear as in dbz or jojo
[0:38:57] <+kachucho> modding community drama atpRtsd
[0:39:04] <%JoshManVGH> The Re-Mako Mod group had a break up?
[0:39:05] <arkv01> seems to happen a lot in the modding community LUL
[0:39:15] <silentshrug> Id settle for a better translation honestly
[0:39:24] <%JoshManVGH> Damn, that sucks
[0:39:39] <+kachucho> at least now nexus mods has an archive version, in case the modders fuck off and make it patreon only
[0:41:34] <+legioned247> sup cat man eli
[0:41:40] <+kachucho> i can always hear you talking about how much ds2 sucks, plague :)
[0:41:52] <+legioned247> your the cat mab
[0:41:56] <+legioned247> man
[0:42:07] <+legioned247> Darth eli
[0:42:08] <+kachucho> darth and sith and lord ResidentSleeper
[0:42:23] <%JoshManVGH> Darth Merengue
[0:42:36] <+kachucho> george lucas is the toriyama version of america, he made his shit along the way
[0:42:37] <Samex_Comex> My sons name also happens to be Darth
[0:42:38] <eliamo101> darths like the jim or john of the world
[0:42:44] <+legioned247> Eli you drawing jinx
[0:43:45] <silentshrug> So you want to discuss the line where lore starts to negatively impact the story thru bloat?
[0:44:03] <%JoshManVGH> Secret Lore: Palpatine calls all his minions "Darth" cause he can't remember their names.
[0:44:11] <+kachucho> headcanon is literally coping
[0:44:45] <+legioned247> so eli do you think that jar jar is a sith lord
[0:46:36] <+kachucho> reminds me of dark souls ost Kreygasm
[0:46:40] <%SilverRoddo> I feel i could accept a 3rd canonical Ewoks Adventure movie.
[0:46:43] <+kachucho> choir missing
[0:47:11] <$SWFanatic> Taking the perspective that works of fiction are allowed to have flaws for the sake of artistic liberty is easier to accept than all these flimsy in-universe lore explanations.
[0:47:20] <%cuumi1> cuumi1 subscribed with Prime. 
[0:47:49] <tanarath> ff7 was wild.
[0:47:54] <Upgradeturtle> just got here who he drawin?
[0:48:48] <tanarath> Eco-freedom fighters taking down capitalism & fighting some crazy alien superbeing.
[0:49:47] <itsdasteve> some of it was delicious shrimp, some of it was overcooked rice
[0:50:02] <tanarath> The pacing was amazing, though. And it all worked out super well for the original ff7
[0:50:53] <tanarath> Didn't the remake have the ff15 director?
[0:50:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:51:15] <+najaytheslug> toby knows how to make a banger
[0:51:21] <%Waffle_Stache> Its perfect
[0:51:32] <+najaytheslug> its fine
[0:51:33] <$SWFanatic> its fine
[0:51:38] <JohnClaggart> it fluctuates because of how music players dont have a baseline of mixing
[0:51:39] <%SuperAmadeus14> yooooo
[0:51:40] <%TheGenieA1> this is the vagrant story opening right
[0:51:44] <%SilverRoddo> HahaThisisfine
[0:51:45] <tanarath> It's fine. And yeah, Toby cranks out bangers in 8/16/32 b/s
[0:51:47] <%JoshManVGH> Sort of. Nomura was the 13 Versus director, and he came off the project and was replaced with Tabata, and the game was renamed Final Fantasy 15.
[0:51:52] <+kachucho> this drawing reminds me of orochimaru
[0:52:27] <%JoshManVGH> Nomura then went to focus on other projects such has KH3 and FF7 Remake, which has a codirector whos name escapes me
[0:53:01] <tanarath> Nomura was the one that basically almost bankrupted sony with 15, right?
[0:53:17] <tanarath> or 13 versus.
[0:54:22] <tanarath> A friend of mine looked into it and he kept wanting new fotm stuff, didn't allow actual dev to take place, etc.
[0:54:28] <+kachucho> are any of the ffs connected?
[0:54:45] <+kachucho> are they in the same universe or something?
[0:54:54] <%JoshManVGH> I think 13 as a whole, the entire Fabula Nova Crystalis series kinda did big damage to Squares brand. As well as Final Fantasy 14 (The first release)
[0:54:59] <tanarath> FF 10 & 10-2 are. the 13 series are.
[0:55:04] <eliamo101> the ivalirce ones are
[0:55:09] <$SWFanatic> yeeeee
[0:55:18] <silentshrug> I liked 15 despite its many many many flaws
[0:55:20] <tanarath> But everything else is indivual.
[0:55:36] <tanarath> individual*
[0:55:45] <$SWFanatic> toby fox ost always makes me smile
[0:55:57] <%JoshManVGH> 13 and the game that became 15 where supposed to be same universe but that changed.
[0:56:02] <%JoshManVGH> it's weird...
[0:56:14] <%lemoan> @tanarath I don't think it was Nomura, but the director of 13 did have an obsession with the character lighting. Which had him make like 3 games about her
[0:56:25] <%JoshManVGH> the better ending IMO is in a DLC.
[0:56:44] <%JoshManVGH> The movie was a cool spectacle.
[0:56:49] <silentshrug> Waiting was smart. It received many qol improvements
[0:56:52] <Samex_Comex> You go camping with your Coleman camping gear
[0:57:05] <tanarath> I can't remember who it was who initially did it & I don't really care personally.
[0:57:09] <$SWFanatic> its the death stranding of final fantasy?
[0:57:17] <%SilverRoddo> I’m holding out hope for a FF Musou game, i’d look forward to see grunt enemies pop in and out of draw distance.
[0:57:20] <Profmcstevie> They made a major plot point early on....a movie
[0:57:25] <eliamo101> damn austin wintory does some good osts banner sagas top tier
[0:57:30] <%JoshManVGH> Movie, with Lenna Heady. And there are cuts of it in the final game.
[0:57:46] <+kachucho> Videogame movies Kappa
[0:57:47] <$SWFanatic> i need to finish banner saga
[0:58:00] <%JoshManVGH> But the timeline the movie gives and the time line the game gives don't match up either
[0:58:24] <%SilverRoddo> My dad was watching a French dub of the movie one random night
[0:59:30] <%JoshManVGH> The power scaling is also super weird in that movie/game thing
[0:59:53] <%whyskeywolfe> I'm pretty sure that'll be the title of my biography - "Somehow I Know I'm Gonna Colossaly Fuck This Up"
[1:00:18] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Plague! Benny C1 is an excellent drop, no joking!
[1:00:46] <%JoshManVGH> 16 looks like it's going to use some of the frame work that 15 attempted to set up.
[1:00:49] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Meta reasons, mostly, but Benny can save a party from many clutches

[1:05:11] <StylishButcherPete> StylishButcherPete gifted a Tier 1 sub to JamesCorck! 
[1:05:35] <%AerthasVeras> do you want "actual reason" that you get from ds3
[1:05:40] <Cosmozitan72> Where can I buy your hat?
[1:05:43] <%AerthasVeras> but yeah in ds1 its really simple
[1:06:40] <%Solid_Stro> Which video game genre suffers the worst in the storytelling department? I’ve been thinking about this a lot. plagueGripes
[1:07:11] <%JoshManVGH> Cross doesn't unexplain anything in Trigger though. It's like a spin-off sequel of "What are some repurcussions fucking with the timespace continuum"
[1:07:30] <%whimwhisp> Cross had alot of... little ideas that made it terrible~ the bazillion characters thing was to its detriment. Nothing about Cross's design complemented it. You just ended up with a endless pool of poorly developed sods you don't care about.
[1:07:59] <%QueequegTheater> At least DS2 didn't actively ruin a bunch of stuff in 1 like 3 did
[1:08:07] <%AerthasVeras> damn you miyazaki!
[1:08:10] <+bottomlesscoffin> Couldn't stuff like that be characters in-universe getting things wrong because Gwyn existed millenia ago?
[1:08:23] <+tussletoes> this is hyperbolic because my memory fails me, but hasn't miyazaki himself admitted he doesn't like to write sequels? if true it makes sense
[1:08:26] <+bottomlesscoffin> Y'know, a centuries long game of telephone
[1:08:40] <$SWFanatic> Excuse me, but in season episode 3 scratchy hits the same key on the bone xylophone and it makes two different notes. Are we supposed to believe that he has some sort of magical xylophone?
[1:09:31] <Profmcstevie> Death of the Author is an important concept after all
[1:09:46] <%Solid_Stro> The idea of “We’ll come up with the story as we go along” is infuriating to me plagueBark

[1:11:05] <%QueequegTheater> I like DS2 a lot but I get why people didn't want a sequel
[1:11:26] <Profmcstevie> Nobody writes Bible 2
[1:11:47] <$SWFanatic> Bible 2: Jesus goes back to School
[1:11:58] <silentshrug> Would a prequal showing the events be better
[1:12:26] <eliamo101> i once saw Gwyn in a parking lot scoffing down twin humanities as he  went around dealing life gems
[1:12:26] <%Solid_Stro> Bible 2; Electric Boogaloo

[1:12:41] <Coystick> When I look at the lost crowns trilogy alone, separate from the vanilla DaS2, I like it. different kings across time and space fighting against Gywn's curse.

[1:13:02] <Coystick> You can't tell Japan no cycles they love cycles
[1:13:15] <Samex_Comex> Citizen Kane 2 the revenge
[1:13:26] <%QueequegTheater> "Also the Pope is evil"
[1:13:31] <$SWFanatic> Citizen Kane 2: Dead Again 3
[1:13:36] <Profmcstevie> "Citizen" is ACTUALLY a code word for a secret project
[1:13:42] <%theloganbrand> Citizen Kane 2 is a commentary on generational wealth
[1:13:42] <%AerthasVeras> its like doctor who. the original plan wasn't for him to regenerate, but the show was so popular that they made him regenerate
[1:13:45] <+tussletoes> citizen kane 2: it's a Cycle
[1:13:48] <%Solid_Stro> Japan loves cyclical storytelling.
[1:13:52] <eliamo101> the new matrix looks dodgy with the implication the first trilogy was a dream all along
[1:14:00] <Darikethe> tppowerFX1 tppowerZedd tppowerFX1
[1:14:02] <leinadtonu> Citizen Kane 2: Rosebud's rising
[1:14:08] <$SWFanatic> lol
[1:14:31] <Samex_Comex> The was a second sled
[1:14:51] <Darikethe> Citizen Kane 3: The Sled needs to be rebuilt
[1:15:08] <%Solid_Stro> Generations of Narutos
[1:15:34] <%SilverRoddo> It rhymes
[1:15:43] <Profmcstevie> We should never have gotten them addicted to opioids huh
[1:15:44] <%QueequegTheater> I'm just enjoying listening to Plague while desperately attempting to break into Endwalker
[1:15:49] <+Ragswolf> mr. gripes
[1:16:19] <rittergeist> Are there ANY good points about to the Star Wars prequel trilogy in your opinion Plague? Only ones I could think of is that the CG looks kinda good for the time and the lightsaber fights are really well choreographed in Ep.3.
[1:16:30] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> @plagueofgripes its also being forced into monomyth esq stories
[1:16:39] <SiroDeMirrah> isn't music too loud?
[1:16:41] <%theloganbrand> hate when I'm getting into a chineese story and the character goes mediate on a mountain for a couple decades to reincarnate
[1:16:41] <Darikethe> I feel the clone wars was cool for what it introduced to the setting but the actual stuff that played out was pretty lame
[1:16:55] <+Ragswolf> Palpatine is the best part of the prequels IMO
[1:16:57] <silentshrug> A story has tropes, but the tropes shouldnt be the goal
[1:16:59] <$SWFanatic> Flash Gordon was genius! The sets were so cheap it was easy to make.
[1:17:01] <+Nepycros> I think that they attach so much of their own imagination to the property that they don't understand that criticizing the prequels isn't destroying the additional baggage they attached to it.
[1:18:32] <+Nepycros> The scale of fuck-up is at least eyebrow raising when you get into the hundreds of millions of dollars producing it.
[1:18:32] <CaerwynMontale> The prequels were really meant as a background to the original story. Not much more than that.
[1:18:36] <Samex_Comex> You learn from history not repeat it
[1:18:44] <$SWFanatic> big titty cigar
[1:18:48] <Darikethe> smoking cigars with the purple cat
[1:18:54] <TIME_PUNCHER> 10/10 californian artist accent
[1:19:00] <%Solid_Stro> You owe me one big titty cigar sir
[1:19:06] <+Ragswolf> the problems were due to no one saying no to lucas right?
[1:19:08] <Darikethe> tppowerFree
[1:19:16] <eliamo101> i remember watching one of them lore videos about how your general people saw jedi and how alot didnt like em cause if their wealth and class then the lore dump reveal was palpatine was behind it all
[1:19:26] <+Nepycros> Asura's Wrath: Genuinely awful. I love every minute of it (as a film).
[1:19:32] <+Ragswolf> Like he george can't do character writing and dialogue but he's good at world building.
[1:19:35] <SiroDeMirrah> Hey Plague, I wanna say that your DS series and take are the best thing I've ever seen on youtube, it has helped me trhough a lot and made me appretiate a lot more the game. Cheers from argentina
[1:20:01] <eliamo101> im just imagining palptine on the star wars equilivant of reddit shitposting maybe the jedi are bad
[1:20:12] <Darikethe> Imagine reddit in star wars though
[1:20:19] <Darikethe> r slash sith are heroes
[1:20:25] <Samex_Comex> You can do it Johnny 5!
[1:20:31] <CaerwynMontale> It does, but I'm getting a bit of Metal Gear Solid in there too.
[1:20:34] <+Ragswolf> reddit star wars. palpatine runs the jedihate subreddit or something Keepo
[1:20:40] <$SWFanatic> number johnny five
[1:20:55] <+Primarch_Victus94> It's the a very good song
[1:20:57] <TIME_PUNCHER> Star Wars and Star Trek achieved such high levels of technology because they don't have social media
[1:21:13] <%Solid_Stro> George Lucas has flaws but it saddens me that he had to “divorce” from his creation. No artists should have to feel that about their work.
[1:21:26] <%SilverRoddo> Johnny 5 got beat down hard, that was a sad time
[1:21:49] <+Nepycros> I look forward to the day someone actually makes their dissertation into an opera and submits that for their masters degree.
[1:21:53] <$SWFanatic> Chappie was a hard movie to watch
[1:22:07] <$SWFanatic> I wanted to like it
[1:22:26] <+Nepycros> What IS Chappie? Just I, Robot in District 9?
[1:22:45] <TIME_PUNCHER> when people say Johnny 5 I think of Marilyn Manson's former guitarist who now works with Rob Zombie
[1:22:59] <$SWFanatic> Its Short Circuit 7: Now with vulgar language
[1:23:06] <guakomo> @SWFanatic yea being from south africa myself, i found it incredibly cringy.
[1:23:08] <%Briskp> lmao that face u just made auteruWheeze
[1:23:21] <SiroDeMirrah> @Nepycros Neil Blomkamp director of District 9 and director of District 9
[1:23:32] <TIME_PUNCHER> Chappie is the Bicentennial Man of I, Robot
[1:23:41] <+Nepycros> @Nepycros District 9 AND District 9?!
[1:23:44] <%JayCantDo> hasRight plagueFace hasLeft  hasRight plagueFace hasLeft
[1:24:19] <silkoh> Hey Eli. Been a fan since the TBFP Regan animations. I know it might be asked alot but do you know when the next DS9 shows might be? You three have gotten me into it
[1:24:53] <%Bigchill___> Hi Eli! plagueTaps plagueWave
[1:25:06] <@PeachSaliva> eli
[1:25:11] <%SilverRoddo> I would be into a Short Circuit reboot, make it about ro-battles
[1:25:24] <TIME_PUNCHER> the REEEEEEquel
[1:25:35] <drastic321> How do you feel about Elden Ring actually applying your fixes when it comes onto certian mechanics, multiple lockons switchable weapon arts etc,This game is good but shudda been made a long time ago its pretty obvious what gonna happen after a year too.
[1:25:41] <%L33tM0us3> oh it was Jinx PogChamp
[1:25:46] <JohnClaggart> i would like the chrono cross remake
[1:26:11] <@PeachSaliva> I’m not super high, I’m like, medium high.
[1:26:12] <%L33tM0us3> is the BGM FFVII or some other FF?
[1:26:35] <TIME_PUNCHER> Paige more like Bob Marley
[1:26:43] <JohnClaggart> that was an ad thing
[1:26:44] <%theloganbrand> Yea, a FTP mobile game
[1:26:55] <CaerwynMontale> they did a cross over with Another Eden. mobile game
[1:26:58] <JohnClaggart> like how nier was in ff14
[1:27:17] <%theloganbrand> Hearing some characters get voiced is cool.
[1:27:26] <CaerwynMontale> Serge, Kid, and Harle are now playable characters in that game
[1:27:33] <silentshrug> So high you became a spirit medium? Wow
[1:27:35] <CaerwynMontale> I REALLY want a Chrono Cross remake
[1:27:50] <CaerwynMontale> We need a Chrono Trigger remake first though
[1:28:12] <%SilverRoddo> Chrono Crusade 4Head
[1:28:25] <rittergeist> Does Japan make things into mobile games like that because they just don't care enough, or because most Japanese people spend time working and in transit?
[1:28:35] <samsaric_prisoner> I replayed chrono cross a while back, it didn't age well. I hope that a speed up option exists
[1:28:42] <Profmcstevie> Japan loves mobile and don't care for PC or console as much
[1:28:45] <ihoedown> RE2
[1:28:54] <%JayCantDo> I like the re remakes those are pretty goof
[1:28:55] <JohnClaggart> most of the good ones are remasters
[1:28:56] <%JayCantDo> good
[1:29:02] <SiroDeMirrah> Demon's Souls?
[1:29:07] <%SilverRoddo> Bubble Bobble?
[1:29:08] <Profmcstevie> Metroid Zero Mission
[1:29:14] <$SWFanatic> I just want the exact same happy memory I had before again for the rest of my life
[1:29:18] <LanceCorpralScottBukake> The soul reaver remake in my head
[1:29:28] <Darikethe> Starcraft II, laughing until I cry how much they ruined the story in that one
[1:29:41] <%L33tM0us3> but SCII was really, really nice for its time, what's wrong with it? monkaS
[1:29:57] <$SWFanatic> Bobby Kotick?
[1:30:01] <ScreamLord> The Legacy of Kain series getting a remake or remaster would be fucking amazing
[1:30:10] <TIME_PUNCHER> Remake Chrono Trigger so it looks like FFX and just sit back and watch
[1:30:17] <%L33tM0us3> it's some boss music, I've heard it before
[1:30:45] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:31:01] <SiroDeMirrah> Isn't this song from Suikoden?
[1:31:10] <ScreamLord> Kitty Plague looks like he trying to hold back the ghost trying to possess him
[1:31:34] <TIME_PUNCHER> I bet they remake Chrono Trigger as an NFT before they remake it as a game
[1:31:53] <%whimwhisp> You're back in time going through lucca's house while it's on fire.
[1:32:05] <%L33tM0us3> Chrono Cross? man.. the feels FeelsBadMan
[1:32:09] <samsaric_prisoner> My issue is when a game gets a minor upscale with nothing else and is called "remastered".  Atlus really did us dirty with the Nocturne rerelease.
[1:32:13] <rittergeist> How long till NFTs finally crash and burn I wonder?
[1:32:21] <%Spadoinkle> Cheer100 Watching you draw inspires and infuriates me. I love it.
[1:32:36] <Presence_Eternal> "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
[1:32:41] <%Solid_Stro> Remake Chrono Trigger without Akira Toriyama’s artwork and I’m in plagueHeh
[1:32:55] <SiroDeMirrah> What is the best horror story from any media in existtence?
[1:32:57] <+tussletoes> i had my gripes about the sotc remake but the demon's remake made it look 1:1 perfect in comparison (just visually)
[1:33:03] <Profmcstevie> Local creative hates his craft, more at 11
[1:33:11] <%SilverRoddo> Probably when electricity is not dirt cheap.
[1:33:17] <%Spadoinkle> Little of both. More the second.
[1:33:19] <Darikethe> A non Toriyama Chrono Trigger is an interesting thought experiment
[1:33:20] <ScreamLord> Chrono Trigger is one of those games only a complete lunatic would try to remake. It's just too goddamn big to do any kind of justice
[1:33:25] <JohnClaggart> they're angry that jinx is regular skin colour instead of pastey white
[1:33:35] <Samex_Comex> I'm always filled with raaaaage
[1:33:37] <TIME_PUNCHER> you lose artist street cred if you like your own art
[1:33:59] <SiroDeMirrah> godamn this song
[1:34:01] <SiroDeMirrah> the feels
[1:34:09] <biglomix> at least it's not the emegency food fairy
[1:34:14] <arkv01> max comf
[1:34:17] <%Solid_Stro> Music makes me sleepy plagueBed
[1:34:20] <arkv01> sugoiSchleep
[1:34:27] <CaerwynMontale> Lmao, isn't it the end of Chrono Trigger?
[1:34:28] <%Spadoinkle> Your lightening is always so good.
[1:34:34] <%SilverRoddo> bitterZzz
[1:34:40] <+tussletoes> i wish lighting in ps360 era games wasn't treated as an incidental result of technical limitations of the era and just changed outright in most remakes/remasters
[1:34:46] <%L33tM0us3> The Girl Who Touched The Stars - FeelsBadMan (it's not this track but it makes me remember it)
[1:34:46] <SiroDeMirrah> favourite CT charachter?
[1:34:49] <Samex_Comex> Poor one out for John Dorito Halo
[1:35:07] <$SWFanatic> John Madden Halo Dorito
[1:35:10] <arkv01> @SiroDeMirrah da baby
[1:35:13] <cerazor01> Cool "joke"

[1:35:26] <JohnClaggart> this song plays during the flythrough of home depot during christmas season
[1:35:27] <TIME_PUNCHER> They remastered Shadow Man before Chrono Trigger. that says a lot
[1:35:54] <Profmcstevie> Farmer town strip clubs sound....depressing, be happy you'll never see any
[1:36:02] <$SWFanatic> Boobs that can look back, what a nightmare
[1:36:04] <%JoshManVGH> People say that $2 bills are used at the one around here. No idea why.
[1:36:06] <StylishButcherPete> Strip clubs are fun for the whole family, Plague
[1:36:09] <SonofStranger> That's just capitalism in a nutshell
[1:36:12] <%L33tM0us3> bro, it's same as vtuber superchats Kappa
[1:36:14] <Samex_Comex> Boobs and hot wings?
[1:36:17] <%theloganbrand> Comedian Voice: Just like my exwife
[1:36:19] <CaerwynMontale> Ahh the Chocobo dance from FF7
[1:36:28] <arkv01> gotta get their nut somehow ☹️
[1:36:30] <%Spadoinkle> Dragged to one once. Stayed fifteen minutes and left for Waffle House. Not a great night.
[1:36:30] <+jmpeil> Cheers from Brazil, Plague
[1:36:56] <JohnClaggart> i actually really like X music
[1:37:04] <JohnClaggart> more than 7
[1:37:06] <%JoshManVGH> @spadoinkle  But you got waffles! That's a win!
[1:37:10] <CaerwynMontale> This music sound like they ripped it from a 90s dance club.
[1:37:12] <+jmpeil> X music is fucking great
[1:37:17] <Profmcstevie> Is any FF known for NOT having good songs? Or less than the usual?
[1:37:22] <+jmpeil> X in general is fucking great
[1:37:24] <TIME_PUNCHER> strip clubs make me think of a discord server devoted to an OnlyFans account
[1:37:26] <%Spadoinkle> True.  did get a waffle.
[1:37:34] <$SWFanatic> theres a piano arrangement album for ffx music, very chill and ethereal
[1:37:48] <CaerwynMontale> 9 was definitely meh
[1:37:52] <Samex_Comex> 7 ate 9
[1:38:03] <%L33tM0us3> 9 needs more love
[1:38:08] <%Spadoinkle> X has like the best turn based combat ever.
[1:38:11] <$SWFanatic> I liked Vivi
[1:38:16] <biglomix> man that weird fake people plot in 9
[1:38:25] <JohnClaggart> i liked the premise of 15, but thats about it
[1:38:29] <arkv01> 10 was the last of the good ones 👍
[1:38:33] <TIME_PUNCHER> the diarrhea volcano from Jackass
[1:38:40] <CaerwynMontale> I'm curious about this new FF1 they are making.
[1:38:41] <%theloganbrand> That russy got me acting unwise though
[1:38:41] <biglomix> wait, 10 had fake people too
[1:38:42] <lemon_lover28> a lot of 9 hate in this chat? I have never played it but always hear that it is one of the best
[1:38:49] <biglomix> so did 7....
[1:38:50] <%JoshManVGH> X-2 has a lot of faults... but it's among the best implementations of the Job system like, hands down.
[1:39:03] <%Spadoinkle> Say what you want about the broken 15, but at least were past the 13 years.
[1:39:05] <Profmcstevie> It's a last hoorah of the older style of JRPG and I can at least respect it for that
[1:39:08] <%L33tM0us3> but the nostalgia googles bro FeelsBadMan
[1:39:27] <%SilverRoddo> csbeastBleetz it gave us the best character, ever ya?
[1:39:41] <+jmpeil> Also for all the flack it gets, Tidus story is pretty good actually
[1:39:57] <%theloganbrand> X-2's secret ending sucks, and it's encounter rate is high. But I do actually like playing that one. Love the Saturday morning cartoon plot
[1:40:02] <%ReverseSceptile> yo thanks for the sub always good to see the art
[1:40:17] <%Spadoinkle> Tidus does actually get a good character arc.
[1:40:24] <+jmpeil> Dub kinda got people shitting on the protag
[1:40:50] <%JoshManVGH> @theloganbrand What secret ending? The completion meter only goes to 99% Kappa
[1:40:51] <Samex_Comex> Wait it's not that?
[1:40:53] <biglomix> all they had to do was side grade
[1:41:01] <JohnClaggart> red into purple
[1:41:06] <CaerwynMontale> Red looks a lot more menacing
[1:41:17] <Profmcstevie> The blue is very...candy looking
[1:41:20] <lemon_lover28> and the silver?
[1:41:27] <%Spadoinkle> I'm not sure what we're talking about?
[1:41:40] <%JoshManVGH> Super Ego?
[1:41:41] <Samex_Comex> Super eggo waffle
[1:41:46] <JohnClaggart> it was like a periwinkle blue
[1:41:46] <+jmpeil> I mean, Black’s Rose is fine
[1:41:54] <biglomix> They got to come in with a plot to use the cosmic balls to power balance some enimies together
[1:42:05] <%JoshManVGH> Wait are DBZ character getting Freudian Power Forms, now?
[1:42:17] <%SilverRoddo> Blue makes want to drink that blue kool-aid, i never liked bloo-aid
[1:42:21] <+jmpeil> God, what a fucking stupid name for a transformation
[1:42:33] <CaerwynMontale> I know right, was about to say, next it'll be super id
[1:42:37] <%Spadoinkle> If that's the case. Isn't Goku always just ID?
[1:42:43] <+jmpeil> Yeah
[1:43:12] <biglomix> I now have "It" memorized
[1:43:12] <+jmpeil> Turns out Goku was always a metaphor for a failing superego
[1:43:20] <%Waffle_Stache> This music reminds me of those 1960's movies
[1:43:26] <%JoshManVGH> I appreciate that Goku keeps finding new bullshit to pull out of hand in order to beat up super ultra mega gods.
[1:43:28] <%Spadoinkle> Yeah, I missed that The Thing watch.
[1:43:52] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Praise the Suns!
[1:43:57] <CyberDingus> PixelBob Both of them
[1:44:00] <silentshrug> I just rewatched Fantastic Mr. Fox. Very relaxing movie

[1:45:02] <%JoshManVGH> Kinda miss the Ozaru transformations.
[1:45:14] <%Spadoinkle> How does the manga even differentiate w/o color?
[1:45:29] <+polothegreatest> ssj4 are real to me dammit NotLikeThis
[1:45:46] <StylishButcherPete> Shit Dark Souls 1's soundtrack is so good
[1:45:59] <+jmpeil> Is the best we can expect from dragon ball franchise now, just more slice of life?
[1:46:12] <Profmcstevie> Losers with barely any power
[1:46:15] <JohnClaggart> the super android 13 movie
[1:46:33] <%Spadoinkle> The Bardock scene in the hallway. Where our protag actually has to think.
[1:46:39] <Samex_Comex> Uses guys like meat shields
[1:47:09] <+tussletoes> love that keichii okabe just let out his repressed tekken in the last few years for this nier track
[1:47:23] <silentshrug> Piccolo vs 17, first Goku vs Vegeta, roshi vs Tien
[1:47:32] <Samex_Comex> I liked when Zamasu died
[1:47:54] <+polothegreatest> gotta love the ton of S in the transformations LUL
[1:48:00] <%L33tM0us3> catJAM
[1:48:08] <+jmpeil> Would you consider stream a DBZ Kakarot LP?
[1:48:42] <+jmpeil> I’d love to hear you shitting all over it
[1:49:01] <JohnClaggart> piss fused with young mae
[1:49:08] <Samex_Comex> King Cold came back and has Coolers form but gold
[1:49:21] <silentshrug> Heroes is that Dragonball multiverse fancomic brought to screen
[1:49:57] <+polothegreatest> heroes is just DB:AF LUL
[1:50:03] <biglomix> They've made the same game 14 times
[1:50:07] <Samex_Comex> Sound like Tekken
[1:50:09] <+tussletoes> tekken composer
[1:50:10] <theredfox930000> sounds like mvc3
[1:50:25] <+tussletoes> it's the only automata song that is like this lol
[1:50:28] <%Waffle_Stache> I only enjoyed the kid gohan bit in Kakarot since you just run around and figure shit out
[1:50:44] <+fireadept> lmao did you not get to automata yet?

[1:51:06] <%SilverRoddo> Dragon Ball Breakers will scratch that grunt vs jobber battle itch.
[1:51:29] <Profmcstevie> Glad they brought out their rulers for number crunching nerds missing the point
[1:51:31] <biglomix> God the power level guys are weird
[1:52:00] <+jmpeil> Have you watched Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop?
[1:52:26] <silentshrug> Top 10 power levels in DBZ. Number 1 will blow your mind!!
[1:52:30] <JohnClaggart> the best only song in the game
[1:53:39] <Samex_Comex> Spike Speigel!!
[1:53:56] <theredfox930000> it's this generations deep space nine RyuChamp RyuChamp lijoeSagat
[1:54:21] <vonepic> As someone who's only seen TNG would you recommend DS9?
[1:54:22] <biglomix> Those anime adaptations have no audience in mind
[1:54:59] <+tussletoes> thought this was a lisa rpg track for a sec
[1:55:04] <biglomix> Painting is a whole lot of smudge and erase
[1:55:54] <rittergeist> What's your opinion on Enterprise? I've heard a lot of very bad things about it thus far.
[1:55:59] <Profmcstevie> The painting or the getting good part
[1:56:00] <JohnClaggart> painting is too many variables
[1:56:01] <%alternative_flu> I thought I accidentally started infinite
[1:56:24] <biglomix> I'm the oppisite, can paint okay, can't line work to save my life.
[1:56:58] <%SilverRoddo> It’s been a long time~ bitterBop
[1:58:06] <Profmcstevie> The ol gripe magic huh
[1:58:23] <+tussletoes> freja is cute
[1:59:01] <gaelic_otaku> The hat makes me think Indiana Jones
[1:59:10] <biglomix> comfort zone
[1:59:35] <biglomix> You could always turn into Baal buddy
[1:59:50] <Darikethe> lol
[1:59:52] <%JayCantDo> I always feel like if I'm frustrated it means I'm getting better
[1:59:59] <+jmpeil> Plague, I listened to an old Wooli Will Figure it Out ep the other day, and heard you talking about some ideas you worked some time ago
[2:00:17] <+jmpeil> So… Damien Reklaw. Have you ever revisited that?
[2:00:30] <+jmpeil> ‘Cause I actually really liked it
[2:01:00] <+modmanawesome69> god i remember being at work listening to that podcast when it came out
[2:01:19] <+jmpeil> And it was great.
[2:01:20] <+modmanawesome69> and just bursting out laughing when i heard it, its so fucking hype
[2:01:31] <biglomix> Did Woolie ever figure out how to make more episodeds of Woolie will figure it out
[2:01:42] <+jmpeil> Not really
[2:01:43] <%SilverRoddo> He feel he’d cut a good wrestling promo.
[2:01:55] <+jmpeil> But he said he’s trying lol
[2:02:36] <+jmpeil> I mean… I used to listen for the insane rambling
[2:03:20] <JohnClaggart> i like this track's crunchy ass synth
[2:03:37] <biglomix> Was that the one where the entire comic was a fight, and the main character was the bad guy, but no he wasn't really
[2:04:05] <+jmpeil> Nah, that was Woolie’s thing
[2:04:16] <%SilverRoddo> That bass line
[2:05:19] <biglomix> People like their perfect control of characters, so they can make dark haired white guy
[2:05:21] <%SilverRoddo> The End of the World!  I believe he had energy arms
[2:05:31] <+jmpeil> Ueah
[2:05:38] <+jmpeil> Mecha with energy arms
[2:06:02] <+jmpeil> But I think played talked about the game he also pitched
[2:06:15] <JohnClaggart> months
[2:06:24] <+jmpeil> 30 minute till the heroes arrive , or something
[2:06:31] <JohnClaggart> there's only like 4 people who even try to do weekly paintings
[2:06:37] <biglomix> Brush econemy comes into play a lot
[2:06:41] <+jmpeil> Cool idea but overly complex
[2:06:41] <JohnClaggart> and they're crazy
[2:07:22] <+jmpeil> Man, Woolie has lots of ideas where the main character turns out to be the villain, huh
[2:07:57] <biglomix> Virgile
[2:08:05] <%SilverRoddo> You either die a hero~
[2:08:37] <biglomix> harp?
[2:08:40] <silentshrug> Woolie is big on subverting tropes, but time turns subversions into tropes of their own
[2:08:47] <JohnClaggart> this sounds way more like a skies of arcadia track
[2:09:00] <biglomix> or asian harp on knees that looks like a guitar
[2:10:00] <biglomix> @BigNLazy I'm so tired of subverted expectations
[2:10:50] <+jmpeil> @biglomix yeah, I too was hurt by GoT’s final season
[2:11:44] <JohnClaggart> starbucks was the winter demon all along
[2:12:08] <biglomix> @jmpeil Oh you know there's going to be subverted expectations in Elden ring If RR is involved.
[2:12:16] <+jmpeil> And Jamie never cared for people
[2:12:25] <+jmpeil> Innocent of otherwise
[2:12:28] <+jmpeil> Or*
[2:13:23] <+CrmznOgre> Yo G man how u been
[2:13:36] <turboyabo> itscre1Eternalflame
[2:13:55] <+jmpeil> @biglomix I don’t know… the biggest subversion would be if Elden Ring wasn’t just big Dark Souls
[2:13:58] <%Spadoinkle> Cheer200 Bed time for this bozo. Keep up the good work, and keep your heart as full as a baked potato.
[2:14:21] <+jmpeil> And I really don’t think they’ll subvert that one
[2:14:22] <biglomix> Why make her green when you know it will be purple?
[2:14:32] <%Spadoinkle> I may need it.
[2:14:33] <%guakomo> i thought the song was about ramen.
[2:15:12] <JohnClaggart> do you make a wall of pillows to keep you still?
[2:15:24] <silentshrug> Im the same. I dont move at all on the couch tho
[2:15:40] <+modmanawesome69> thats a halo
[2:15:43] <%Explodincatz> good song to join in
[2:16:09] <lewdnekojam> huntaaa taaa taa hunttaattaa
[2:16:44] <Profmcstevie> Almost sounds nautical
[2:17:24] <%SilverRoddo> Do y’all put a rolled up blanket or pillow between your knees?  I saw this tv commercial that help solve that sleeping on your side problem.  I knew I wasn’t crazy.
[2:18:36] <biglomix> When will you start selling body pillows for extra Scratch?
[2:18:49] <+jmpeil> @silverroddo yup, also hugging another pillow. The distancing between the knees and the arms being apart really does wonders to my back
[2:18:51] <silentshrug> In Amber Clad is my fav Halo track, i think
[2:19:02] <+jmpeil> But then, this is 30 I guess
[2:19:34] <+jmpeil> One night in an awkward position and you wake all fucked up
[2:19:37] <%Explodincatz> Remixes are good until u keep doing them over and over again
[2:20:27] <biglomix> are you afraid of the dark music?
[2:23:00] <SonofStranger> She kind of has crazy eyes
[2:23:31] <%SilverRoddo> When i sleep on my stomach, i elevate one side of my chest with a stiff pillow, to keep my shoulders stretching backwards.  Tactical sleep tips
[2:23:50] <Playerbam> that Steve Vai solo
[2:25:53] <%SilverRoddo> Steve Vai totally won that guitar duel in Crossroads
[2:26:29] <biglomix> there was an era of women chaning over rock music
[2:27:15] <Samex_Comex> Doing
[2:27:20] <JohnClaggart> uematsu song
[2:27:38] <Samex_Comex> Devil may cry
[2:27:48] <+CrmznOgre> it sounds like it would be in shadow the hedgehog
[2:27:56] <%SilverRoddo> Hostile Groove?
[2:28:30] <JohnClaggart> i think thats the wilhelm scream
[2:28:37] <%SilverRoddo> It rides well 🥁
[2:29:50] <%SilverRoddo> csbeastBleetz praise be to Yevon

[2:33:34] <biglomix> got to gamble it sometimes
[2:34:42] <biglomix> one day I belive you'll be able to make a drawing that has no purple in it
[2:34:49] <Kimigo> yo! loove your darksouls stuff!

[2:38:18] <%Slade_4149> plagueTaps
[2:39:02] <+newbroxes> It's distinct I'll give it that. I still remember that first Automata trailer when this song showed up.
[2:40:02] <biglomix> It's coming

[2:44:50] <Darikethe> Lulu gang where we at
[2:44:56] <+N7niko> “Prostitute yordle” is something I never thought I’d read
[2:45:07] <Drakeotar> Im a poppy Main myself but Bards the sexiest champ out there
[2:45:54] <+N7niko> I didn’t put much time into league. Is Nasus the Anubis one? I liked him.
[2:46:08] <Profmcstevie> Some days all the dials are off by 2
[2:46:10] <Kimigo> same some days are just bad
[2:46:29] <%SilverRoddo> I’d imagine Paiman does 100 pound leg presses, each mornin’
[2:46:29] <+CrmznOgre> whats been shitting up ur months?
[2:46:41] <%Explodincatz> I hope u feel better soon
[2:47:32] <+N7niko> Ominous shift
[2:47:43] <Profmcstevie> Music that sounds like it's in a large hall just makes me relaxed
[2:48:03] <Samex_Comex> We won!
[2:48:09] <+modmanawesome69> that scared me
[2:48:20] <Samex_Comex> Everyone do a pose

[2:48:31] <%SilverRoddo> bitterDab
[2:49:00] <%DeadLemmy666> hey plague i  just passed my final. I want to say thank you. your motivational talks played no small part in me going back to school.
[2:50:11] <%SilverRoddo> Yes, school is good.  I’d go back, but winter makes it tough.
[2:50:45] <%DeadLemmy666> i hear that
[2:50:53] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:50:57] <biglomix> depends on the degree, account is boring but those fuckers get paid
[2:51:07] <JDebss> Sadge
[2:51:49] <%guakomo> school was basically just kid jail for me, freaking hated it.
[2:52:49] <biglomix> I saw an article about how pissed parents where that their kids would remote learn once a week, took their babysitters away
[2:53:10] <Lixagon> this is a very pretty song
[2:53:35] <+BryceWilli> BryceWilli subscribed with Prime. 
[2:53:51] <+DamnFineCupofStreaming> brain chemicals are bullshit
[2:53:51] <%Glass_Muffin> i feel that
[2:54:21] <%SilverRoddo> Adult learning centres makes the experience less jaily.  Well, if the students are there to learn, although, there is always that one guy who still acts like a brat.
[2:54:23] <biglomix> your not that lucky
[2:55:24] <Samex_Comex> The chat is hiding psychic vampire's
[2:55:48] <JohnClaggart> dont forget the mysterious background eggs
[2:58:19] <IsaacClarkeANCAP> The Orb?
