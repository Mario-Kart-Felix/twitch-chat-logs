[0:03:23] <laserbeaming> teathePickme
[0:03:40] <rearedlogarithm> Both.
[0:03:42] <+Scevda> Yes
[0:03:52] <+CJett92> Infuriating? Sometimes.
[0:03:52] <Graujaeger> When it's baba, it's the worst if you know the answer but the streamer don't
[0:03:53] <laserbeaming> It's anxiety inducing mostly
[0:03:53] <Presence_Eternal> Stressful?
[0:03:54] <Skeletonmanners> cant watch today but hope you have a great time plague
[0:03:54] <DraxTD> Ask @PeachSaliva's fan @PlagueOfGripes ... then you'd know =P
[0:03:56] <kamirsk> Do you wan't a hint?
[0:03:58] <Garden_Hills> Im at calm watching rather than having to think about it myself
[0:04:02] <DillionPHCO> I'm relaxing in my anxiety
[0:04:11] <bettysharkface> Yesss
[0:04:15] <KellBeII> if you know the answer its anxiety inducing if you do not know the answer its relaxing
[0:04:32] <+CJett92> Does Baba sink?
[0:04:34] <rearedlogarithm> Oh, I see it.
[0:04:35] <+pee_foam> ah, i just figured it out. i won't say anything of course.
[0:04:40] <rearedlogarithm> Ah, never mind.
[0:04:58] <Graujaeger> u a smartie plague
[0:05:01] <rearedlogarithm> Nie.

[0:05:36] <thiccguy305> What good plague?
[0:05:42] <+pee_foam> ok THIS ONE i never figured out
[0:05:49] <bettysharkface> Oh man I got stuck on this for ages
[0:06:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Baba is everything and nothing
[0:06:18] <bettysharkface> I can't even remember how I solved it.
[0:06:36] <+Ragswolf> Hi Plague :)
[0:06:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Baba is a non metaphysical concept. Of word Salads
[0:07:11] <bettysharkface> I do love the way this game sort of reduces streamers to cavemen
[0:07:30] <+Ragswolf> why say many word when few word do trick
[0:07:31] <Superpseudo_> "Spin the middle side topwise, topwise!"
[0:07:52] <+Ragswolf> soon we say unga bunga, snort and click to have discussion

[0:14:23] <+CJett92> Bingo bango
[0:14:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yes
[0:14:39] <KellBeII> i assume the "is" can only be used for one statement right?

[0:15:00] <+CJett92> @KellBeII That is that question, huh?
[0:15:26] <Graujaeger> it makes baba into key, but baba is considered "you" but baba is turned into a key
[0:15:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> But Baba
[0:15:41] <bettysharkface> It's not in a coloured box, so it has to go at the start
[0:15:41] <+Ragswolf> you are baba and transform into key
[0:15:41] <thebigbrewbird> only baba can be you
[0:15:45] <+CJett92> +
[0:15:52] <+JailShmixRemix> Can you move FLAG?
[0:15:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> But it ceases to be
[0:15:59] <laserbeaming> Ah, I got it ow
[0:16:20] <+CJett92> Gotta do a +
[0:16:42] <Calek> hey it's the level I quit on
[0:17:24] <%SilverRoddo> Oh, it’s not level one.
[0:17:28] <+PenmanLupine> I think the and needs to be ignored?
[0:17:31] <+HiddenPorpoise> You keep setting up the right answer and then going back without testing it
[0:17:33] <coldarmracer> wtf, he actually streams
[0:17:50] <DillionPHCO> No Plague doesn't stream
[0:18:00] <laserbeaming> Plague Plagues
[0:18:19] <+JailShmixRemix> This isnt Plague
[0:18:26] <+PenmanLupine> oh, I get it. you can't move the key unless baba is also key
[0:18:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> So just finished Beastars Gosha is a good grandpa
[0:18:48] <+Ragswolf> crossword?
[0:18:52] <+CJett92> +
[0:19:13] <+HiddenPorpoise> This is way more simple than you think it is, Plague
[0:19:19] <+YabbaTroll> just try it
[0:19:19] <+PenmanLupine> try it
[0:19:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> I think you cqn crossword it
[0:19:24] <+Scevda> Then try it
[0:19:27] <+PenmanLupine> if you don't know if you can do it, then try it
[0:19:44] <+Heart0fInk> Use your laser eyes to blast your way in.

[0:19:56] <axivate_> stuff that is shut can be deleted by stuff that is open
[0:19:57] <+ChilArlequin> you'll figure it out
[0:20:02] <LixFury> Wrong stucture
[0:20:03] <+PenmanLupine> thats not a cross
[0:20:03] <+Ragswolf> he'll figure it out

[0:20:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sometimes you say you are just fine but you are not fine.mp3
[0:20:59] <+YabbaTroll> its more simple than you think kinda
[0:21:08] <thebigbrewbird> try putting """IS"" near the WIN ?
[0:21:09] <LixFury> The verbs need to be after the nouse
[0:21:12] <Luizabd> @PlagueOfGripes Only straigt lines work
[0:21:13] <+Scevda> Truth @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:21:14] <LixFury> nouns*
[0:21:14] <+ChilArlequin> well, ya gotta remember that "and" doesn't do anything on its own from the looks of it
[0:21:23] <laserbeaming> Plague forgot the rules of the game I guess
[0:21:29] <+HiddenPorpoise> Don't work inside the puzzle, cheat
[0:21:34] <+CJett92> =D
[0:22:14] <peachteagaming> baba is smart
[0:22:33] <cap_bon> Brain is hurt
[0:22:46] <+CJett92> you......
[0:22:47] <+CJett92> did it
[0:23:11] <%SilverRoddo> Never don’t do it
[0:23:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> Darkness Imprisionong me
[0:23:18] <axivate_> You don't HAVE to be baba
[0:23:48] <%SilverRoddo> All that i see
[0:23:56] <+ChilArlequin> ...can you shift around nouns? I've never played this before
[0:24:08] <+HiddenPorpoise> Who says there even needs to be a baba
[0:24:32] <+ChilArlequin> er, I mean verbs (I think)
[0:24:43] <Rellim80> What is the end goal? Flag and win?
[0:24:55] <+PenmanLupine> its Win and something
[0:25:26] <+JailShmixRemix> Key is you and win GivePLZ
[0:26:06] <+Ragswolf> and
[0:26:11] <silverira> I'm here for less than a minute and I did here more logic and reason than thime Peach streamed this
[0:26:25] <silverira> time*
[0:26:38] <KellBeII> is there a way to place an object behind the win and then push it into the corner?
[0:26:45] <silverira> hear*
[0:26:56] <+JailShmixRemix> cant push anything thorugh the water block
[0:26:56] <silverira> cant english good :(
[0:27:08] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Plague is You
[0:27:39] <+ChilArlequin> oh, so you can shift around verbs. this is actually pretty simple then
[0:27:46] <thebigbrewbird> hey
[0:27:46] <cap_bon> but baba is you
[0:27:47] <thebigbrewbird> what if
[0:27:51] <thebigbrewbird> baba is multiple things
[0:27:54] <thebigbrewbird> and you use one baba
[0:27:55] <+HiddenPorpoise> Stop working in the rules you have made for youselft
[0:27:58] <thebigbrewbird> to delete the water
[0:28:05] <+JailShmixRemix> Key is you and open? wouldnt work
[0:28:11] <+Scevda> Be a thing you can delete (temporarily)
[0:28:22] <silverira> can' you use the words to push the key out of the water?
[0:28:22] <+HiddenPorpoise> You can't do the path you think you are trying
[0:28:30] <axivate_> you can make baba is key
[0:28:32] <cap_bon> baba is a cutie
[0:28:41] <+Draylle> have you tried duplicating either flag or key?
[0:28:42] <laserbeaming> Baba is Lewd
[0:28:52] <TheImmortal70> Oh I see
[0:28:55] <thebigbrewbird> make it BABA IS YOU AND KEY and use a baba to die
[0:28:57] <TheImmortal70> It's much simplier than he think
[0:28:59] <+JailShmixRemix> OH I SEE
[0:29:02] <TheImmortal70> I think anyways
[0:29:02] <thebigbrewbird> and delete the water
[0:29:03] <PinkCatHime> Oh I think I get this one
[0:29:09] <+JailShmixRemix> Also dekillMay Immortal
[0:29:14] <PinkCatHime> Wait no I don't
[0:29:23] <+YabbaTroll> I think you might forget one of the rules needed
[0:29:23] <TheImmortal70> Oh you're a part of this community too Jail
[0:29:29] <+CJett92> @thebigbrewbird But then he isn't using Open, which deletes the water
[0:29:30] <+JailShmixRemix> I am everywhere
[0:29:33] <laserbeaming> this one is hard
[0:29:36] <markdreizehn> remember the belmont saying plague GRAND CROSSSSSSSSS
[0:29:37] <axivate_> would it help to make baba a key?
[0:29:46] <+YabbaTroll> a noun can be is another noun, not just a verb
[0:29:53] <+YabbaTroll> my head hurts
[0:29:57] <silverira> wait I think I got it
[0:29:58] <+HiddenPorpoise> The AND is the solution
[0:30:01] <%SilverRoddo> Perhaps it’s requires philosophical solution, such as giving up, it’s a lesson we all can learn, sometimes, there is no answer. LuvPeekR
[0:30:13] <+KusoDM> Baba is plague
[0:30:14] <KellBeII> if you were both the key and baba would it game over by sacrificing the key to open the water?
[0:30:18] <silverira> can't you be the key and baba at the same time?
[0:30:30] <+ChilArlequin> something something, the ultimate philosophical quandry is self death
[0:30:32] <Torivore> Become 2 things and sacrifice one?
[0:30:38] <silverira> yeah you can
[0:30:55] <+PenmanLupine> but how to make 1 of those sacrifices Open is the issue
[0:30:57] <+Scevda> @Torivore thats the extent of it yes
[0:31:01] <axivate_> can you turn nouns into other nouns?
[0:31:14] <+EpicBigchill> you can chance flag or key to the other
[0:31:18] <+Draylle> @Torivore pretty much, just duplicate one of the words
[0:31:18] <+HiddenPorpoise> Noun - noun clones
[0:31:19] <+EpicBigchill> by using the cross of is
[0:31:20] <Futurecity10> Anyone who plays ff14 on aether?
[0:31:22] <+arfafax> BABA and YIFF is WIN?
[0:31:26] <silverira> if lose key or baba the game doesn't stop so... can't you sacrifice one to get the statement out?
[0:31:34] <KellBeII> dont feel bad eli this is a tough one
[0:31:45] <lowdrawn> plague have you seen interspecies reviewers
[0:31:47] <%SilverRoddo> Don’t give a noun a high paying job, then i’d be a pro-noun.
[0:32:27] <decq> believe in your potential plague!
[0:32:49] <+JailShmixRemix> Top left?
[0:32:51] <+HiddenPorpoise> noun-noun
[0:32:54] <alextrebeken> be baba and key?
[0:32:59] <Rellim80> Key is open?
[0:33:19] <markdreizehn> What about Flag?
[0:33:19] <cap_bon> but baba ceases to be
[0:33:21] <axivate_> key is flag - then you can control two keys with less statements
[0:33:30] <thebigbrewbird> make flag is you and open?
[0:33:44] <+Ragswolf> same thing
[0:34:02] <+ChilArlequin> you can only control things with the "you" statement it seems, so you can't just mash two nouns together
[0:34:04] <+HiddenPorpoise> Stop saying things without testing
[0:34:20] <thebigbrewbird> PLAGUE TRY FLAG IS OUT AND OPEN
[0:34:22] <thebigbrewbird> TRUST ME
[0:34:28] <thebigbrewbird> THERES TWO FLAGS
[0:34:49] <+JailShmixRemix> ?
[0:34:51] <+Ragswolf> calm down dood
[0:35:02] <+ChilArlequin> ?? if there are two flags, that's a pretty big spoiler
[0:35:06] <Superpseudo_> flag is key or key is flag
[0:35:15] <+HiddenPorpoise> NOUN is NOUN
[0:35:23] <axivate_> honestly puzzle games are difficult to watch. You always want to test out your own theories
[0:35:32] <Essixian> Flag is open?
[0:35:42] <Futurecity10> have you tried moving win at all?
[0:35:45] <thebigbrewbird> Flag is you AND open
[0:36:04] <TheOneUpWarrior> what about the water is stop and shut at the bottom?
[0:36:10] <+ChilArlequin> oh wait. I get it now.
[0:36:12] <+EpicBigchill> you have to duplicate one of the nouns
[0:36:26] <Essixian> Baba is you and open?
[0:36:33] <silverira> if key or baba "dies" isgame over if you are both?
[0:36:41] <PinkCatHime> @TheOneUpWarrior That's just to set up the water's properties for this state. Stop means you can't walk through it, shut means you can open it with an open command
[0:36:49] <TheImmortal70> Maybe you'll get a better idea if you count the number of entities you can be?
[0:36:50] <thebigbrewbird> Flag is you and open.... please plague sama
[0:36:52] <LittleBigQuebec> can you turn something else as you?
[0:36:56] <LittleBigQuebec> like 2 babas
[0:36:59] <LittleBigQuebec> or 2 keys
[0:37:01] <+HiddenPorpoise> NOUN IS NOUN
[0:37:17] <axivate_> ... so you need two of one noun.
[0:37:18] <+arfafax> Flag is Key?
[0:37:21] <thebigbrewbird> YOU DONT NEED TO ALWAYS BE BABA
[0:37:21] <+ChilArlequin> if you want a less spoilery hint (while being completely useless), it revolves around "Is"
[0:37:44] <+PenmanLupine> you are right now
[0:37:55] <+HiddenPorpoise> And only works if Is is at play
[0:37:56] <TheOneUpWarrior> so can you make water is flag and open?
[0:38:06] <+PenmanLupine> can't get to the water because water is Stop
[0:38:16] <Rellim80> Can you interact with key/flag once they exist as something like Open?
[0:38:19] <TheOneUpWarrior> I guess I'm on the wrong track nvrmimd
[0:38:29] <TheOneUpWarrior> sorry my bad
[0:38:36] <+HiddenPorpoise> You don't need to do anything you think you need
[0:38:37] <LittleBigQuebec> what if FLag is key
[0:38:50] <+ChilArlequin> there wouldn't be any way to mess with water properties even if you "opened" one of the blocks
[0:39:02] <+konekoryugamine> oh, this level
[0:39:03] <PinkCatHime> Even if flag is key, it can't be pushed
[0:39:16] <+EpicBigchill> thats the first part
[0:39:17] <thebigbrewbird> try Key is you and open?
[0:39:20] <+ChilArlequin> just mash everything together
[0:39:33] <%SilverRoddo> Can you Tetris L block a sentence.
[0:39:47] <+HiddenPorpoise> Shut your whore mouth with "wait hold on"
[0:39:53] <+EpicBigchill> FIRST STEP!
[0:40:00] <+arfafax> Key is Flag and then Key and Baba is You and Open fhaeThink

[0:45:26] <ElementalTem> Good evening everyperson!
[0:45:28] <+PenmanLupine> but wait, Robot can Push
[0:45:35] <+arfafax> Woolie is Thief and Pie is Stolen ?
[0:45:35] <zafooru> hello tem
[0:45:54] <+ChilArlequin> wait, is robot never able to be you? or is it a left to right thing
[0:46:00] <+HiddenPorpoise> YOU is a tag, not a noun
[0:46:05] <thebigbrewbird> hehehehhehehehehhehehe he said pipe
[0:46:07] <Essixian> Move Is Win!
[0:46:43] <%SilverRoddo> LuvPeekL hi ElementalTem
[0:46:46] <+PenmanLupine> use the robot to push the Is past the skulls?
[0:46:47] <cap_bon> baba is burp
[0:47:15] <+PenmanLupine> there is no And so you have to
[0:47:18] <+arfafax> Robot is Baba (is You) ?
[0:47:19] <Essixian> Could you finagle it so you can change to Robot is You and Baba Is Move at once?
[0:47:39] <+konekoryugamine> ROBOT IS BABA IS YOU?
[0:47:53] <+Sebenoth> Make robot into another baba?
[0:47:53] <+LordSDB> you is robot?
[0:48:04] <TheOneUpWarrior> oh yes I am the secret pervert
[0:48:06] <Torivore> Looks like a similar solution to the previous room
[0:48:15] <+PenmanLupine> I think I get it. You have to make the robot push the whole Robot is Move statement past the skulls
[0:48:21] <laserbeaming> Robot is YOU, Baba is You
[0:48:39] <laserbeaming> that works too
[0:48:55] <+HiddenPorpoise> DO IT
[0:48:58] <Corencio> You've got a Baba on the inside
[0:48:59] <zafooru> DEW IT
[0:49:00] <+QuasartheHero> plagueChirei
[0:49:04] <+HiddenPorpoise> DO IT COWARD
[0:49:07] <+PenmanLupine> I think 1 can die
[0:49:09] <Torivore> Destroy the child
[0:49:22] <Corencio> Yeah
[0:49:24] <+PenmanLupine> test before assume
[0:49:28] <Corencio> You only lose when nothing is you
[0:49:33] <+JailShmixRemix> Plague killed Baba :(
[0:49:38] <+konekoryugamine> Thumb up
[0:49:39] <Essixian> BABA IS WIN
[0:49:41] <MyNameIsRasus> Assuming makes an ass out of you and ming
[0:49:55] <zafooru> Its ok that Baba was a synth
[0:50:00] <+konekoryugamine> BOG
[0:50:02] <laserbeaming> Baba is Dead, Long live the Baba
[0:50:07] <Corencio> Well
[0:50:17] <+Sebenoth> Baba ceases to be!
[0:50:18] <zafooru> PPie
[0:50:25] <Essixian> *Angry Mr. Incredible meme* FLAG IS FLAG!
[0:50:32] <MyNameIsRasus> It means flag
[0:50:34] <zafooru> cannot transmogrify flag
[0:50:34] <sasparillatango> flag is always flag
[0:50:39] <bettysharkface> Oh this one was kinda fun/satisfying
[0:50:40] <Torivore> Piep is stpo
[0:50:45] <axivate_> @Essixian exactly my first thought 😂
[0:50:50] <+konekoryugamine> ROBOT IS PUSH AND MOVE
[0:50:57] <NiktenKing> immutable
[0:51:02] <+ChilArlequin> @konekoryugamine would you stop spoiling?
[0:51:11] <bettysharkface> Also stop spamming answers
[0:51:26] <bettysharkface> If he doesn't do it himself, what's the point
[0:51:42] <sasparillatango> what happens if something is move and stop?
[0:51:43] <+JailShmixRemix> To make him do it the way we want it done
[0:51:47] <+ChilArlequin> baba frickin' DIED.
[0:51:58] <+JailShmixRemix> living vicariously through plague
[0:52:19] <+ChilArlequin> that sounds like an advanced form of parasitism
[0:52:22] <laserbeaming> Oh, I think I get it
[0:52:31] <+konekoryugamine> @chilarlequin Wait, am I? Sorry about that! I'm giving suggestions! Was it a spoiler? I am SO SORRY!!
[0:52:37] <%SilverRoddo> Throw your jacket over the bog. So, you won’t ruin your shoes.
[0:52:41] <laserbeaming> plagueFace
[0:52:47] <Corencio> But.... baba is naked
[0:52:55] <Corencio> No jacket
[0:53:14] <Aussie_Manny> Robot is Move.
[0:53:32] <+ChilArlequin> personally I don't know if it's the answer but y'know. more vague suggestions is typically better @konekoryugamine
[0:53:38] <PotatoGabe> 'Ello.
[0:53:43] <Aussie_Manny> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[0:54:01] <Aussie_Manny> I shouldn't have stopped for that haircut.
[0:54:03] <Aussie_Manny> Sorry.
[0:54:06] <+PenmanLupine> making 2 is probably the right move but the rest of this is pretty fucked
[0:54:15] <%SilverRoddo> Ahh. HahaCat Hi, PotatoeGabe
[0:54:20] <+JailShmixRemix> Maybe you ned to stop a robot
[0:54:50] <PotatoGabe> Howdy'do. Didn't know Plague streams, just joined from his tweet an hour ago
[0:54:50] <Aussie_Manny> Cog is Move and Robot.
[0:55:03] <Essixian> Cog and robot is move?
[0:55:09] <%SilverRoddo> Use the words as a bridge, walk over the words. Words is bridge. HahaThink
[0:55:10] <+PenmanLupine> Baba is always you so can't use the become win condition trick

[0:56:44] <+QuasartheHero> @aussie_manny indago baba
[0:56:54] <%SilverRoddo> Golembot
[0:56:58] <Corencio> Exactly
[0:57:07] <+CJett92> OOOOOOOOOOOOH
[0:57:08] <Corencio> Wait
[0:57:11] <+ChilArlequin> move makes things just go back and forth right? seems like "stop" has to do something
[0:57:12] <+Scevda> Flag is rock
[0:57:17] <+PenmanLupine> no way to make the robot go up or down
[0:57:21] <Corencio> No, rock is just there to confuse you
[0:57:25] <+CJett92> * is * and *
[0:57:26] <thebigbrewbird> flag is dywane johnson
[0:57:29] <Aussie_Manny> omg you have to USE the robot on the other side! LUL
[0:57:43] <Aussie_Manny> aw, fuck this level. it's so involved. LUL
[0:57:45] <LixFury> you have the base concept, just applyed wrong
[0:58:09] <Essixian> Can you make the robot up and down by moving the "Is" and "Push" below "Robot"?
[0:58:14] <Essixian> *robot move
[0:58:14] <+Scevda> Lets make sure of that!
[0:58:25] <LixFury> robots can push statments
[0:58:51] <Eightgutter> :)
[0:59:01] <+EpicBigchill> you cant
[0:59:21] <Wigglebottom_> use your words plague LuvPeekR
[0:59:21] <+EpicBigchill> I think your internet is goofin up
[0:59:27] <+ChilArlequin> it feels like this game really just pushes you try everything out instead of only thinking about it
[0:59:30] <GildeBishopp> Can you push "cog" and "is" to win?
[0:59:41] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:00:20] <laserbeaming> it's pretty involved
[1:00:21] <Torivore> Now you're thinking with verbs
[1:00:22] <LixFury> I lession in over thinking
[1:00:42] <+ChilArlequin> huh.
[1:00:50] <+EpicBigchill> @PlagueOfGripes the move the way they were last pushed

[1:01:13] <+EpicBigchill> if I remember correctly
[1:01:15] <Nero_Cross> things move the direction their sprite is facing when you activate "move"
[1:01:20] <+JailShmixRemix> WOAH
[1:01:24] <KellBeII> chet the good guy
[1:01:25] <+ChilArlequin> I wonder if you're expected to know that by now
[1:01:36] <DatGreyMind> This game looks brain breaking
[1:01:46] <+JailShmixRemix> ChetThe(sub)RIPPER sajamErnie
[1:02:00] <+ChilArlequin> that's.. really strange, but useful to know
[1:02:04] <ChetTheRipper> Cheers folks!

[1:02:11] <KellBeII> < 3
[1:02:22] <zafooru> jack the ass ripper wtf
[1:02:25] <+JailShmixRemix> No its because he was JACKED
[1:02:35] <+Scevda> And the women died of the audacity of it all.
[1:02:36] <+ogtrashwizard> Hi plague
[1:02:50] <zafooru> how can ripping ass benefit *me?*
[1:02:54] <laserbeaming> LuvUok
[1:03:06] <+ChilArlequin> oh god, my whole solution feels like it'd be a pain in the ass
[1:03:19] <PinkCatHime> I have an idea, too, and it seems really annoying
[1:03:41] <Torivore> Jack Dutch ovened those poor women to death
[1:04:03] <redrix_3> !uptime
[1:04:03] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 4 minutes 14 seconds
[1:04:04] <+JailShmixRemix> Remember plague you can push words to the otherside too
[1:04:10] <+EpicBigchill> you have the right idea but are moving the wrong thing
[1:04:12] <+ShogunNoonto> Baba is you
[1:04:35] <zafooru> but how can this be
[1:04:36] <+EpicBigchill> you learned something with the water one
[1:04:36] <Eightgutter> :)
[1:04:38] <+EpicBigchill> that you can apply here
[1:05:02] <+EpicBigchill> you can push them into place
[1:05:03] <%SilverRoddo> Do, or do not.
[1:05:22] <+EpicBigchill> flag is always flag
[1:05:24] <+ChilArlequin> oh wait.. I think I get it now
[1:05:25] <Corencio> Flag ___ rock ___ win
[1:05:51] <laserbeaming> But Flag is Flag
[1:05:59] <PinkCatHime> Flag can only be Flag
[1:06:01] <Corencio> Yes
[1:06:04] <+ChilArlequin> BUT consider flag is not yet a verb
[1:06:13] <bettysharkface> What's that smell? It's brain
[1:06:23] <laserbeaming> oh, right
[1:06:25] <%SilverRoddo> We all want to touch The Rock.
[1:06:32] <Impeachedpear3> Hello Plague, how are you tonight?
[1:06:37] <redrix_3> an is statement is required on the right side no matter what to win
[1:06:58] <+ChilArlequin> might as well give it a shot to see what you *can* do
[1:07:06] <+JailShmixRemix> You can cross robot is move and the is statement
[1:07:15] <+JailShmixRemix> *and the is statement over the water
[1:07:30] <+Draylle> "brute smarts"
[1:07:35] <zafooru> Brute Smarts.
[1:07:41] <+Sebenoth> Stop being a Seigmeyer
[1:07:51] <+Scevda> Would disagree with random stuff but I get what you mean.
[1:07:55] <redrix_3> what do you mean doing random shit isnt how to solve puzzles
[1:07:57] <+EpicBigchill> flag is always flag
[1:07:59] <%SilverRoddo> Pulling a Homer.
[1:08:05] <+ChilArlequin> but I mean.. it definitely feels like you're missing a piece o' info to work with
[1:08:21] <+Scevda> Spider poison is people poison
[1:08:24] <+EpicBigchill> flag and rock is win
[1:08:32] <+KevinsLunchbox> oh man I remember this level. took me a bit to finagle it
[1:08:33] <+ChilArlequin> which is why you might as well knock out any preconceptions while you can
[1:09:12] <Katakumo> Do you need to use the flag word?
[1:09:16] <redrix_3> what are all the things and can be used for
[1:09:16] <LixFury> remember you can crossword
[1:09:24] <+Scevda> Then just do the first step then, two robots!
[1:09:28] <Corencio> Correct
[1:09:29] <+ChilArlequin> and...??
[1:09:38] <+JailShmixRemix> Crosswords!
[1:09:38] <laserbeaming> Make a Turing Machine, teach it to solve the puzzle for you
[1:09:42] <+EpicBigchill> no
[1:09:46] <LixFury> Wrong
[1:09:46] <Corencio> No
[1:09:48] <PinkCatHime> wrong
[1:09:53] <PinkCatHime> Flag is Flag
[1:10:14] <+ChilArlequin> you're on the right track, but flag can only be flag
[1:10:14] <Eightgutter> oh true, flag is flag
[1:10:30] <LixFury> Cog and Rock is Bait
[1:10:32] <+ChilArlequin> big brain time
[1:10:32] <+KevinsLunchbox> chat stop being wrong
[1:10:47] <redrix_3> how about flag is rock
[1:10:49] <Corencio> What do you mean?
[1:10:59] <+EpicBigchill> overthinking it
[1:11:05] <+JailShmixRemix> Instead of pushing one thing think of pushing mutiple
[1:11:05] <LixFury> Big overthink
[1:11:12] <+hgtarras> Hey plague
[1:11:19] <+ChilArlequin> when things are "move" that means they also innately push things, right?
[1:11:23] <+mandroid74> How about "flag AND rock IS win"
[1:11:29] <+EpicBigchill> No
[1:11:33] <+Scevda> MAYBE
[1:11:39] <+Scevda> might as well try
[1:11:42] <+EpicBigchill> no
[1:11:49] <+JailShmixRemix> Yes
[1:11:53] <Corencio> Exactly
[1:11:55] <+KevinsLunchbox> plague needs to unlock Galaxy Big Brain
[1:11:56] <Corencio> That is the baba experience
[1:12:00] <+Scevda> Can u get pregaaaante?
[1:12:03] <zafooru> I spaced out for a minute and tabbed away, hearing that was some surreal 400 IQ babble
[1:12:06] <laserbeaming> Baaaaaaba
[1:12:06] <redrix_3> well when all else fails its time to do random shit and pray
[1:12:07] <NiktenKing> Do or do not. There is no try.
[1:12:14] <%KevinsLunchbox> KevinsLunchbox subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:12:22] <+JailShmixRemix> Think about pushing multiple things Plague instead of 1
[1:12:25] <Eightgutter> you're making progress
[1:12:32] <%SilverRoddo> Possiblie. I mean, possibly.
[1:12:34] <+Scevda> First step! Two robots!
[1:12:43] <+ChilArlequin> advantage/disadvantage, no. only rules
[1:12:46] <+EpicBigchill> it is
[1:13:01] <LixFury> It is tho
[1:13:03] <Corencio> That's one way to do it
[1:13:05] <+Scevda> You tried one iteration of it
[1:13:12] <Wigglebottom_> two robots means more slaves FeelsOkayMan
[1:13:13] <Eightgutter> figure out win condition first
[1:13:19] <laserbeaming> 2 robots will work
[1:13:36] <+Sebenoth> You need eyes on the inside
[1:13:37] <%SilverRoddo> Yes. Brute force it.
[1:13:44] <Corencio> What if.... flag and rock is win?
[1:13:46] <Torivore> Didn't you make the cog move vertically at one point?
[1:14:05] <PinkCatHime> I think I understand how to move things up and down over there
[1:14:18] <+ChilArlequin> since things only move in the direction they're pushed, the object can only move left or down in this situ
[1:14:20] <LixFury> Robot can move and push, also crosswords
[1:14:32] <+JailShmixRemix> Crosswords!
[1:14:33] <+ChilArlequin> I don't think there'd be enough room to move things up and down near the win condition
[1:14:40] <redrix_3> make it possible to push the robot to move it up or down
[1:14:48] <zafooru> BABA is NIHILISM
[1:14:53] <redrix_3> robot is push
[1:14:54] <+ChilArlequin> I think it ALL matters Kappa
[1:15:02] <+pyrotherian> PLAGUE is BABA?
[1:15:02] <+JailShmixRemix> You can push full statements
[1:15:05] <+EpicBigchill> flag AND rock is win
[1:15:06] <+Scevda> what ELSE DO YOU HAVE
[1:15:07] <+pyrotherian> Babaaa
[1:15:09] <Corencio> But you have a flag
[1:15:11] <Srthunda> flag is rock and win?
[1:15:40] <+Scevda> That pause
[1:15:41] <+Scevda> lol
[1:15:45] <+ChilArlequin> classic text to speech jank
[1:15:50] <SwagetronPrime> flag is rock, rock is win
[1:15:51] <StaceMcGate> nah, just animation
[1:15:52] <katitron_> Flag and rock is win
[1:16:00] <PinkCatHime> Chat, Flag can only be Flag
[1:16:14] <%SilverRoddo> We need that, thanks.
[1:16:15] <Corencio> Exactly
[1:16:20] <+ChilArlequin> but plague, that's why you watch things over and over when you multitask
[1:16:23] <StaceMcGate> it was good background noise!
[1:16:24] <+EpicBigchill> is win
[1:16:25] <Corencio> You can make the statement "flag is rock," but it won't work
[1:16:25] <SwagetronPrime> ah, flag and rock is win then
[1:16:27] <+EpicBigchill> yeahhhh
[1:16:28] <+EpicBigchill> there you go
[1:16:30] <+JailShmixRemix> Yes
[1:16:32] <+Scevda> there you go
[1:16:32] <Corencio> Yes
[1:16:34] <+ChilArlequin> we're getting SOMEwhere
[1:16:36] <LixFury> THE
[1:16:38] <LixFury> THEY TURN
[1:16:40] <Wigglebottom_> its learning BegWan
[1:16:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BUT BA BA
[1:16:51] <laserbeaming> Either that or the paper for some reason transitions into how much Japan hates Tien
[1:16:53] <+ChilArlequin> if only baba could become bababot
[1:16:57] <+Scevda> ....
[1:16:58] <katitron_> YES
[1:17:00] <+JailShmixRemix> .....
[1:17:06] <+Sebenoth> Plague has gained insight
[1:17:11] <Corencio> You're doing it
[1:17:12] <zafooru> That's the Do It
[1:17:13] <SwagetronPrime> nice
[1:17:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> deww eet
[1:17:16] <+ChilArlequin> he has opened his third eye
[1:17:30] <NiktenKing> Eyes is inside
[1:17:37] <katitron_> You only need the robot once
[1:17:37] <%SilverRoddo> Don’t do what Donny Don’t does.
[1:17:43] <Wigglebottom_> BegWan
[1:17:47] <+ChilArlequin> BIG brain moves
[1:17:49] <LixFury> So close
[1:17:54] <+ChilArlequin> noice
[1:17:57] <StaceMcGate> noice
[1:17:58] <Wigglebottom_> Clap
[1:18:00] <Corencio> Yes 👏
[1:18:01] <Eightgutter> never seen that solution before, neat
[1:18:02] <LixFury> Galaxie brain
[1:18:02] <redrix_3> fortnite dance
[1:18:05] <%Samex_Comex> Wooo party!
[1:18:05] <+Scevda> please clap
[1:18:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> clap
[1:18:11] <StaceMcGate> but Baba
[1:18:11] <%SilverRoddo> bitterDab bitterDab
[1:18:12] <+ChilArlequin> no, you needed all of them
[1:18:13] <Corencio> This game likes giving you red herrings
[1:18:19] <PinkCatHime> Pretty sure you could have moved a cog over there, then turned it into a robot to push the win word down
[1:18:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BUH BAA BAA
[1:18:20] <+reiface08> BABA IS RED HERRING
[1:18:20] <+JailShmixRemix> Theres like 10 ways to solve it plague, you could use any of the elements
[1:18:21] <Wigglebottom_> too much think
[1:18:25] <LixFury> that was it
[1:18:27] <Corencio> That's how I did it
[1:18:27] <+Scevda> THats one of them
[1:18:27] <+ChilArlequin> I'm pretty sure that's the way
[1:18:34] <+AMSTHEGREAT> this makes me want to load up baba is you again, and totally not do that at the same time.
[1:18:35] <zafooru> it wanted you to win
[1:18:36] <Eightgutter> there's a hard version of the level later
[1:18:36] <SwagetronPrime> that was the most logical one
[1:18:38] <Corencio> You could've moved the rock and the cog separately
[1:18:38] <+JailShmixRemix> LOL
[1:18:40] <TheImmortal70> The inteneded solution is the one you found
[1:18:42] <redrix_3> that looked intended
[1:18:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> THATS A LIE
[1:18:48] <Corencio> Oh.
[1:18:49] <StaceMcGate> 9 1/2 ways to solve that puzzle
[1:18:50] <NiktenKing> the idea is that duplicate phrases do not work. combos work
[1:18:50] <+ChilArlequin> I would've actually moved the cog and bot separately, yeah
[1:18:54] <Corencio> Baba has gun
[1:18:57] <+Scevda> Baba is GUN
[1:18:58] <Corencio> vineSchut
[1:18:59] <laserbeaming> Imagine solving a Jigsaw Puzzle and having extra pieces
[1:19:01] <zafooru> Baba has GUN and is PISSED
[1:19:02] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KEKE PUSH

[1:22:04] <Corencio> You can't do push is wall
[1:22:13] <+ChilArlequin> I feel like assuming that you need "more" than what you have is a big pitfall
[1:22:25] <Corencio> Yeah
[1:22:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ooooh
[1:22:29] <NephiStreams> LUL your stream title is a mood

[1:23:47] <+SpecialKei> 🤔
[1:23:47] <Corencio> Not really
[1:23:49] <DuoScratch> can keke be pushed out of the wall if you set it up right?
[1:23:49] <+Sebenoth> Baba is top
[1:23:56] <Corencio> There's a thing about the word "push"
[1:23:59] <DuoScratch> like by the words?
[1:24:01] <+EpicBigchill> you CAN move the cross of you are
[1:24:09] <chambatron> Baba is wall?
[1:24:10] <redrix_3> slowly move the statements by replacing keke and baba all the way to the wall is stop statement to somehow become wall
[1:24:16] <StaceMcGate> with the power of push, you can't move the wall?
[1:24:16] <zafooru> OH! I remember this one, it's fucked
[1:24:21] <+ChilArlequin> push wall, bro
[1:24:24] <+ChilArlequin> that's my guess
[1:24:33] <chambatron> Keke is wall?
[1:24:51] <Corencio> Try it
[1:25:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> OOOOOOOH
[1:25:06] <Corencio> See

[1:25:11] <SumKnowBuddy> what?
[1:25:14] <Corencio> Yes
[1:25:15] <redrix_3> thats not what i was expecting
[1:25:15] <+Sebenoth> Nobody puts keke in the corner
[1:25:16] <SumKnowBuddy> thats dumb
[1:25:18] <SwagetronPrime> gj plague
[1:25:21] <Corencio> You can spontaneously exist inside words
[1:25:33] <DuoScratch> wall is push.
[1:25:34] <%SilverRoddo> Keke is clip
[1:25:36] <+JailShmixRemix> Yup, here comes the stupidity
[1:25:37] <StaceMcGate> Baba ceased to be

[1:26:47] <laserbeaming> I LOVE BEING FRUSTRATED
[1:26:47] <TheImmortal70> So it's worth it

[1:26:48] <bettysharkface> Is nice
[1:26:48] <Katakumo> YES
[1:26:49] <+ChilArlequin> I'm pretty relaxed about this whole thing, I know even less than you
[1:26:57] <zafooru> Z o o m
[1:26:57] <Corencio> I enjoy watching other people solving these things
[1:27:00] <+KingGoblodyte> I like seeing people figuring things out
[1:27:02] <Corencio> Ew
[1:27:06] <StaceMcGate> oof, this screen is hard to look at
[1:27:07] <NiktenKing> I hate it, but I LOVE IT.
[1:27:15] <+Sebenoth> I hate it, and yet must watch
[1:27:25] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> just get bigger eyeballs
[1:27:27] <zafooru> spicy water
[1:27:30] <Eightgutter> I struggled with this one
[1:27:32] <NephiStreams> watching others struggle like i did with this game is entertainment :')
[1:27:35] <%SilverRoddo> It’s like watching a horrible video and feeling helpless to do nothing to help the people in said video.
[1:27:37] <PinkCatHime> baba is drown
[1:27:39] <+ChilArlequin> oh god, this looks hellish
[1:27:48] <redrix_3> water is not sink just push it
[1:27:56] <Coystick> This looks like it's meant to overwhelm you first of all
[1:27:59] <laserbeaming> BABA is HOT
[1:28:30] <chambatron> IS WATER IS
[1:28:32] <zafooru> Is that cog made out of ice cream?
[1:28:40] <redrix_3> water is win
[1:28:46] <+ChilArlequin> so it reads left to right and top to bottom, right?
[1:28:47] <redrix_3> why not water is win
[1:28:48] <%SilverRoddo> “You’re my waterwall.” 🎶
[1:29:00] <Corencio> Water is hot so that you can't sneak the cog past it
[1:29:08] <redrix_3> nvm
[1:29:50] <Corencio> Oh
[1:29:58] <+Scevda> QUICK stop that water!
[1:30:08] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> can you push things through skull?
[1:30:27] <+guardian_collin> what does the cog even do?
[1:30:32] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[1:30:33] <Eightgutter> so you can't do water is cog
[1:30:34] <Corencio> :)
[1:30:49] <redrix_3> baba is you is water for funny
[1:30:49] <DensityD> tokki8Hi hello plague
[1:30:52] <+Sebenoth> Just focus on what you have control over, i guess
[1:31:48] <Corencio> Not really
[1:31:49] <+Shotgundam009> KonCha
[1:31:51] <DuoScratch> what about water is stop, and have sink on the water when you do it?
[1:31:52] <Corencio> Well yeah
[1:31:55] <Corencio> Sink works on anything
[1:32:00] <Corencio> Open and close only work on each other
[1:32:04] <NiktenKing> delete a water
[1:32:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> skull is... sink?
[1:32:32] <Malisin_Murder> !uptime
[1:32:32] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 32 minutes 43 seconds
[1:32:45] <Luizabd> Water is skkull?
[1:32:47] <chambatron> Move IS SINK to the next side
[1:32:53] <+Shotgundam009> This game ruined my mind
[1:33:00] <chambatron> And make Water be on top of water
[1:33:04] <Malisin_Murder> Paige playing this game was so fucking funny LUL
[1:33:08] <+Shotgundam009> and I love it
[1:33:13] <+Fireking1099> push the skulls with another item?
[1:33:20] <Coystick> Cog is push and sink and sink a skull?
[1:33:28] <redrix_3> cog is melt so that is weird to add since sink gets rid of it anyway
[1:33:32] <chambatron> Is plague reading the chat?
[1:33:34] <+Scevda> Cog is water?
[1:33:42] <DuoScratch> could Win is Water work?
[1:33:43] <DensityD> why would plague read chat
[1:33:45] <DensityD> Kappa
[1:33:50] <+Sebenoth> Grab opposing corners and turn it topwise
[1:33:51] <Corencio> You can't make backwards statements
[1:34:02] <whittacre> but cog is water would remove all of the water
[1:34:10] <DensityD> what are all effects of "melt"?
[1:34:12] <warmnoid> oh man, this level took me awhile
[1:34:20] <whittacre> sorry, sorry,
[1:34:22] <whittacre> water is cod
[1:34:24] <whittacre> *cog
[1:34:40] <redrix_3> can you push things into the skulls?
[1:34:44] <Wigglebottom_> does sink kill the skull?
[1:34:44] <+Fireking1099> what happens when you push water/is/sink into a skull?
[1:34:46] <+ChilArlequin> true, and there's no way to move "cog" yet
[1:34:48] <chambatron> You have to make a path to move the vog to the left
[1:35:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> Cog is still puch
[1:35:11] <+illharmonic> "Water is sink" needs to be horizontal on the left side of the water, then push the whole phrase to the right and make "sink" delete one of the waters? Is that it?
[1:35:11] <+ChilArlequin> many cogs will be harmed in the completion of this level
[1:35:12] <Luizabd> Make water is skull at least try your ideas out
[1:35:14] <redrix_3> if so then you can use the statements to unlock win by pushing them into the skulls
[1:35:14] <chambatron> you have to put the cog on the skull to make it disappear
[1:35:18] <DensityD> this isn't pac-man rules, right? you won't warp to the opposite side when moving off screen, correct? no?
[1:35:18] <laserbeaming> the cog sinked the water
[1:35:25] <Corencio> Right
[1:35:28] <Corencio> The walls are solid
[1:35:29] <%SilverRoddo> Sometimes, a cog is just a cog.
[1:35:33] <DuoScratch> water is stop
[1:35:35] <juxtest> Can you push the sinking cog onto Skull?
[1:35:43] <+ChilArlequin> wait.. does *anything* sink when pushed into water? even words?
[1:35:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[1:35:53] <Corencio> HahaThink
[1:35:53] <zafooru> congratulations you failed the puzzle
[1:35:54] <Coystick> A big beautiful wall
[1:36:00] <chambatron> It's water is sink on the right side but the word water has to be on top of the water
[1:36:16] <+DescendantDroog> will cog push the skulls?
[1:36:17] <Corencio> Text is an object you can mess with
[1:36:25] <+Shotgundam009> to drown?
[1:36:26] <redrix_3> push statements into skulls to unlock win
[1:36:38] <laserbeaming> The water sank into the cog when you pushed it, I don't know if that did anything, but I find it fun
[1:36:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rawr rawr rawr
[1:36:41] <+ChilArlequin> baba is GUN and ANGERY
[1:36:54] <DensityD> can't use incorrect syntax, like "Win is Water" right?
[1:37:24] <Coystick> Baba is gamer, gamer is rising, rising is up
[1:37:27] <chambatron> water is sink but the word water has to be on the blue water
[1:37:33] <whittacre> pretty sure it goes [unbordered text] is [bordered text]
[1:37:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BABA is SOCIETY
[1:37:48] <+Fireking1099> IS there any way to move the skulls
[1:37:50] <Ziulysses> Can you use the Water, Is, Sink and the cog to go through the skulls and push FLAG
[1:37:51] <Corencio> society is defeat
[1:37:52] <DensityD> @whittacre thank you
[1:37:58] <Corencio> Ah.
[1:37:58] <+ChilArlequin> I shoulda known.
[1:37:58] <chambatron> Yes
[1:38:01] <Aussie_Manny> You...... sank the water.
[1:38:06] <redrix_3> now what
[1:38:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ooh
[1:38:11] <Corencio> The words sank into the water
[1:38:18] <chambatron> You can't win anymore because you needed IS sink
[1:38:22] <Coystick> #cogsquad
[1:38:23] <redrix_3> you're trapped
[1:38:24] <DuoScratch> can cog push skull????
[1:38:26] <Aussie_Manny> That HAS TO BE the work of an enemy Stand.
[1:38:26] <+ChilArlequin> push... skulls?
[1:38:33] <laserbeaming> what do you do with the cog?
[1:38:33] <Someperson109> Push skulls with cog
[1:38:34] <+Simketh> push the skull from the right?
[1:38:37] <whittacre> skulls need to be push
[1:38:42] <chambatron> You needed IS SINK
[1:38:45] <+ChilArlequin> oh wait. I get it now
[1:38:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> COG IS SINK
[1:38:55] <Corencio> He'll get it
[1:38:57] <Blackenford> win is sink?
[1:38:58] <redrix_3> skulls not stop so push the statements into the skulls to push flag is win
[1:38:58] <chambatron> COG IS SINK but you don't have IS sink anymore
[1:39:01] <chambatron> YES
[1:39:05] <chambatron> Water
[1:39:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYYE
[1:39:18] <redrix_3> and then use cog to sink water to get to flag
[1:39:19] <Corencio> LUL Not quite
[1:39:21] <Coystick> Yoooooi
[1:39:24] <chambatron> Nope
[1:39:45] <Ziulysses> @PlagueOfGripes Can you use the Water, Is, Sink and the cog to go through the skulls and push FLAG
[1:39:47] <+ChilArlequin> pretty sure you can pass through water now, I think
[1:40:24] <chambatron> Get rid of WATER
[1:40:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[1:40:29] <chambatron> Yes
[1:40:35] <Corencio> VoteYea
[1:40:35] <chambatron> COG IS SINK
[1:40:46] <Corencio> You're on the right track
[1:40:56] <redrix_3> plague please this hurts
[1:41:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> KNIS SI GOC
[1:41:14] <Corencio> The flag is a sinkhole
[1:41:26] <+ChilArlequin> what even is baba (other than you)
[1:41:27] <redrix_3> flag absorbs baba
[1:41:29] <+KingGoblodyte> "BUNNY DROWNS IN FLAG, MORE AT 11"
[1:41:34] <Corencio> I think Baba is a sheep? Or a bunny.
[1:41:35] <zafooru> baba is friend
[1:41:38] <Ziulysses> @PlagueOfGripes (Sink Is Water cog)
[1:41:47] <Coystick> wait is baba a bunny or a sheep?
[1:41:48] <chambatron> Push the cog into the skull and then cog is sink
[1:41:50] <Corencio> Kind of oddly shaped for a bunny
[1:42:06] <DuoScratch> what if you had water back, then you put the cog on a skull, and made cog is sink?
[1:42:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cogo is sinky boi
[1:42:19] <DuoScratch> you'd have one less skull and 3 words to push with!
[1:42:29] <Corencio> So
[1:42:31] <+gambit_gamble> Wait who is baba?
[1:42:34] <Corencio> What needs to be destroyed?
[1:42:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SINK is STRONG
[1:42:36] <+ChilArlequin> @gambit_gamble you
[1:42:38] <zafooru> BABA is GOD
[1:42:40] <Corencio> We are all Baba
[1:42:48] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> everything but the baba sink
[1:42:49] <+ChilArlequin> baba is us
[1:42:52] <laserbeaming> Yeah, and you can make the cog destroy a skull
[1:42:57] <+gambit_gamble> ohhh noo
[1:42:59] <+Scevda> But how can this be
[1:43:00] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 47 months! almost 4 years. btw I got stuck on this one for like an hour.
[1:43:01] <redrix_3> break water is sink. push cog to left side. use cog to act as fourth pushable to get flag is win. then push cog into water to sink it. get flag
[1:43:05] <Coystick> The real baba is the friends we made along the way
[1:43:08] <+Fireking1099> I got it now
[1:43:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> [BABA] [IS] [THE FRIENDS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY]
[1:43:30] <+Fireking1099> you want a cog to sink a skull
[1:43:45] <zafooru> What do you need the Cog over there for?
[1:43:48] <laserbeaming> Evangelion 4.0: Baba is (Not) You
[1:43:53] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> YEYEYEYEYEYYEYE
[1:43:56] <Corencio> Won't know until you try
[1:43:56] <chambatron> ye
[1:43:59] <Corencio> Behold
[1:44:00] <Coystick> Yoooo
[1:44:04] <zafooru> well shit
[1:44:04] <DensityD> gg
[1:44:09] <Corencio> Why not?
[1:44:09] <+Scevda> JUST TRY IT NEXT TIME<
[1:44:10] <laserbeaming> The skull sinked into the cog!
[1:44:11] <+Fireking1099> sink kills everything
[1:44:12] <DuoScratch> Why not? Cog is Sink.
[1:44:13] <NiktenKing> why not?
[1:44:13] <Corencio> The skull sank into the cog
[1:44:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> COG IS PUSH
[1:44:15] <+Scevda> Love you Eli
[1:44:16] <+ChilArlequin> if cog sinks, anything that touches it goes poof, it seems
[1:44:18] <redrix_3> thats a completely different method to what i had
[1:44:20] <NiktenKing> COG is SINK
[1:44:21] <Gibbles1337> if water can do it, why not cogs?
[1:44:23] <chambatron> Cog is sink so it deletes anything it touches
[1:44:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> SINK IS GOD
[1:44:41] <Corencio> Yes
[1:44:44] <+ChilArlequin> highway to... the danger zone?
[1:44:46] <zafooru> you need to be level 80 to approach those and live
[1:44:53] <Corencio> Those ones are the bonus stages
[1:45:08] <+ChilArlequin> it's.. the same one?
[1:45:12] <+ChilArlequin> oh, wait.
[1:45:14] <Corencio> I watched someone spend, like, an hour on this one
[1:45:20] <Corencio> Good luck :)
[1:45:31] <TheWe4pon> lewd
[1:46:09] <laserbeaming> Baba is Lewd
[1:46:10] <+ChilArlequin> it seems pretty easy, I think..
[1:46:21] <zafooru> RIP
[1:46:39] <Corencio> But the key is not you
[1:47:07] <NiktenKing> because there is no BABA, there is no YOU
[1:47:20] <+Scevda> Baba Is tandem is a penis. Youre gonna open the water vag with the a key or flag and push the tandem in. From the top.
[1:47:29] <Corencio> There's one small difference
[1:47:42] <EuropanLamprey> Pat's just rambling on about Balder's Gate 3, had to leave
[1:47:55] <+ChilArlequin> which means.. you need two objects to be "open"
[1:48:32] <+Fireking1099> change all 3 to be the same thing?
[1:48:48] <Corencio> Hm.
[1:48:49] <DensityD> say the line, bart
[1:49:00] <EuropanLamprey> That's kinda the point in a lot of later levels
[1:49:31] <peachteagaming> pat is talking about baldersgate
[1:49:34] <+Fireking1099> you is win?
[1:49:45] <wingwinder> you and win
[1:49:50] <%SilverRoddo> Flag soul transfer.

[1:52:46] <+SirGO0SE> AMAZING
[1:52:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BABA is NANI
[1:53:06] <heartlesshealer> you have one disposable body
[1:53:16] <brebbabreb> A key????
[1:53:17] <peachy996> plague is follow
[1:53:20] <bevyrage> plague is baba?
[1:53:21] <supersugoisenpai1> I remember this puzzle, took me a few hours
[1:53:25] <chronoxgp> don't you touch win with baba?
[1:53:29] <Dragon_Batman> Nice
[1:53:29] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[1:53:30] <+JonWhoLovesFlatWomen> :O
[1:53:36] <alextrebeken> but today is saturday
[1:53:39] <+SirGO0SE> baba is AYAYA
[1:53:41] <Corencio> You have to extract "win" and put it in a statement
[1:53:45] <YakumoYomi> I will enjoy all of your content, and you can't stop me.
[1:53:48] <Coystick> Baba is AMAZING
[1:54:02] <%SilverRoddo> Next this Saturday.
[1:54:03] <+Caidezes> Baba is confusion.
[1:54:06] <laserbeaming> You can get the horrible anime video now if you give Plague a dollar on Patreon!
[1:54:08] <+notEisiger> I suffered a shart attack midstream, is that a farmer I hear
[1:54:25] <dickbuttwoman> o/ Hi plague!
[1:54:29] <heartlesshealer> oooh, it's this one actually. Dang
[1:54:54] <%JJCheeker> I like your game Dick
[1:55:10] <+lutefiiisk> I watched Paige play this and I think I lost brain cells in the process
[1:55:11] <%JJCheeker> I meant name1
[1:55:25] <+Fireking1099> key is you and?
[1:55:43] <+SirGO0SE> mmmm MEEE
[1:55:45] <+Jaysky> Baba is Mean
[1:56:04] <heartlesshealer> it's hard to see a way to move around the Is and You
[1:56:13] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes what if you broke the water directly above and below win?
[1:56:23] <Corencio> I'm pretty sure that's not possible
[1:56:32] <bevyrage> can you push words through water?
[1:56:41] <Corencio> Water is stop, so no
[1:57:01] <+ChilArlequin> I like how simply saying the rules of nouns makes us sound like idiots
[1:57:01] <bevyrage> oh i didn't see the bottom right corner
[1:57:01] <Futurecity10> uh, why not just push the key under win?
[1:57:02] <bevyrage> makes sense
[1:57:02] <falineth> you can't make them all into something because you also have to be that thing and that can't work
[1:57:03] <dickbuttwoman> X
[1:57:11] <heartlesshealer> be the two things, dump one of them in, then be the other thing?
[1:57:19] <+ShinHadokenman> Flag is key?
[1:57:22] <laserbeaming> I think you have to push two things at the same time?
[1:57:26] <heartlesshealer> I got stuck on this one
[1:57:39] <+Fireking1099> switch out open
[1:57:44] <bevyrage> baba is flag and key?
[1:57:46] <+ChilArlequin> something has to be "you" in order to control it and they can't be pushed. only words are innately pushable, it seems
[1:58:05] <Corencio> Yeah
[1:58:08] <AntChodeny> use one of the flags to delete water square?
[1:58:15] <bevyrage> ah crap
[1:58:29] <+Fireking1099> this is quite simple
[1:58:44] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Why not just turn key into a third baba?
[1:58:45] <heartlesshealer> make a cross around the word Is?
[1:59:25] <+ChilArlequin> can.. baba sacrifice itself, and push a different noun above "is"?
[1:59:25] <heartlesshealer> I'm gonna stop typing, I'm not helping
[1:59:39] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:59:44] <bevyrage> is there a possibility to open up the [water is stop and shut] bit?
[1:59:45] <SoFarFetched> I mean this game is trying a bunch of ideas
[1:59:48] <+Fireking1099> switch out baba and key, make a cross with is and baba
[1:59:49] <nofestu2> can you go through the water if you're open?
[1:59:54] <metabot64> will I caught the plague if i keep watching this stream?
[1:59:55] <+gralho> open does what?
[2:00:04] <SoySocks> i think you were on the right track regarding making all 3 items the same
[2:00:06] <AntChodeny> do you need open?
[2:00:06] <+ChilArlequin> there wouldn't be any space to push the words in the bottom right even if it's opened
[2:00:07] <Corencio> Open makes you a key. You can open a thing that's shut, but then you go away
[2:00:09] <metabot64> *catch
[2:00:12] <laserbeaming> Oh, I see
[2:00:23] <+ShinHadokenman> Key is baba to have 3 babas
[2:00:28] <laserbeaming> oh no, I don't see
[2:00:33] <Corencio> 👀
[2:00:37] <+ShinHadokenman> then use two babas too open?
[2:00:43] <+Fireking1099> key is you, baba is open
[2:00:45] <+ShinHadokenman> and use 3 baba to win
[2:00:56] <+ChilArlequin> something has to be "you" in order to be able to control anything, just so y'all know. and only words are innately pushable
[2:01:04] <Corencio> What if you don't have to get "win" out of there?
[2:01:09] <+ShinHadokenman> no won't work
[2:01:22] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes what about using baba2 and key to enter the center and make bab is you and win?
[2:01:35] <bevyrage> you can have two statements using the same [IS] yes?
[2:01:38] <AntChodeny> this game killed Peach
[2:01:47] <+ShinHadokenman> baba is you and key
[2:02:00] <+ShinHadokenman> then change it to baba is open?
[2:02:02] <+Jaysky> Baba is Cute at least
[2:02:04] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes but didn't a previous puzzle require you to be is win?
[2:02:04] <fetrigon> You should get a piece of paper and write down your thoughts. Nothing saying you can't do that.
[2:02:08] <+ChilArlequin> @ShinHadokenman that turns baba into key, which means there is no more baba to be you
[2:02:24] <+ChilArlequin> word logic sure is weird.
[2:02:30] <lionmanguy> That's an important logistical fact to remember for certain puzzles
[2:02:41] <nofestu2> position one baba in the bottom right and then turn off open
[2:02:46] <Corencio> If you are "you" and "win" at the same time, then you win
[2:02:58] <falineth> this one is easy to over think
[2:03:06] <+ShinHadokenman> Chil I'm wondering if he makes it so you is baba AND key baba neing the top word
[2:03:17] <+ShinHadokenman> would it turn the key into a 3rd baba
[2:03:26] <impartialcredit> !uptime
[2:03:26] <@Nightbot> 2 hours 3 minutes 37 seconds
[2:03:35] <DensityD> beer is beer
[2:03:38] <+ShinHadokenman> and then you exchange it for baba is open
[2:03:41] <Corencio> It's very logic heavy
[2:03:42] <bevyrage> okay okay i got it plague
[2:03:47] <+KingGoblodyte> LIKE A DOOR
[2:03:48] <impartialcredit> zoneCry
[2:03:59] <Huntercd> can't bunnies swim though?
[2:04:06] <%Samex_Comex> Baba is food
[2:04:21] <+ChilArlequin> @ShinHadokenman yeah, it wouldn't work. it's top to bottom and "and" doesn't turn something into something else. it's like, an extender of the sentence logic to another object
[2:04:23] <+ShinHadokenman> would he have 3 babas then the 3rd baba stays away and the other two die to open the space
[2:04:25] <bevyrage> i thought i had it but then i lost it
[2:04:32] <+ShinHadokenman> Ah i see
[2:04:32] <laserbeaming> There was a Hole here, it's gone now
[2:04:34] <+ChilArlequin> which means baba and key would be controllable, but wouldn't become each other
[2:04:42] <%SilverRoddo> Bunny is jobber
[2:05:00] <NekoUrabe> sbfpSweetbaby
[2:05:14] <+ChilArlequin> again, I do quite enjoy how even talking about the game rules makes us sound like babbling idiots
[2:05:16] <Corencio> Or.... you have to change the way you think about the problem :)
[2:05:23] <Ragnakawaii> ✌
[2:05:43] <bevyrage> does [you is {x}] work?
[2:05:47] <EuropanLamprey> What level is this? I want to try it myself
[2:05:51] <+Sebenoth> you only need to delete 1 square of water
[2:06:06] <bevyrage> key and baba is you work or nah
[2:06:14] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes Baba is you and water?
[2:06:30] <+ShinHadokenman> Plague can you turn 3 items to the same thing so that you can use two to open and the third to push win out of the water?
[2:06:34] <Corencio> @bevyrage You is [thing] doesn't work, but two things can be you with and
[2:06:38] <+ChilArlequin> I'd say you have to push "win" through water but water is stop
[2:06:48] <Calek> @s1rcuit that'd turn Baba into Water and then Baba is no longer you and then you die
[2:07:11] <falineth> @ShinHadokenman no you can't make somthing you and make somthing into it since you have only one is tile
[2:07:26] <+ShinHadokenman> interesting
[2:07:45] <Corencio> Uh
[2:07:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> Why not just use the flag to open up Win?
[2:07:49] <+ShinHadokenman> my alcohol addled mind is dumb
[2:08:01] <+TheMattman1313> Flag is you and water
[2:08:11] <Corencio> He can't get win out of that little cave
[2:08:13] <+ChilArlequin> @CommanderSqueaks you can only push, not pull
[2:08:15] <+ShinHadokenman> flag and you is water?
[2:08:20] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> i'm 12 and what is this?
[2:08:22] <+Nobrev> @CommanderSqueaks how would you get the win out? You cant pull things
[2:08:28] <bevyrage> if you made 3 [you]s you could push [x] is you over towards that spot then? then from there you'd just need to push it up to make space to let you push one thing down
[2:08:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> To remove the water beneath win
[2:08:38] <+ChilArlequin> it's... like, you literally cannot move "object is you" horizontally"
[2:08:38] <+trustycoyote> This is fascinating
[2:08:47] <ZComiX> why not try openning something else with those two keys?
[2:08:52] <falineth> it would have to be water is you anyway
[2:08:55] <+frobeards> you is water wouldn't work anyway
[2:08:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oooooooh
[2:09:01] <bevyrage> unless you move all three simultaneously
[2:09:08] <kingmorsluciscaelum> the moment you move is, baba dies
[2:09:20] <bevyrage> generate 3 baba then try pushing them over at the same time?
[2:09:39] <+Sebenoth> you dont want more water
[2:09:44] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> ___ and ___ is ___
[2:10:02] <+ChilArlequin> oh.. wait.
[2:10:03] <Corencio> ___ is ___ and ___
[2:10:18] <+FadingEmber> Do you want a small hint?
[2:10:21] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes Are you able to push something into the water and keep going? If so, push something into the water under win?
[2:10:36] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes Brain is Stop
[2:10:39] <Sunstalker> Can you push it up from below so 'is' is next to win and then you shove 'key' next to 'is win' and move over to win?
[2:10:40] <bevyrage> @Futurecity10 nah water is stop. check bottom right
[2:10:40] <falineth> you can move it across alternating between you being a pair of thins and a single thing but it isn't need
[2:11:04] <+FadingEmber> So just get rid of the water
[2:11:15] <+Nobrev> @futurecity10 you still wouldn't be able to get WIN into a position where you can use it
[2:11:19] <ZComiX> you were on the right track with the two flags i think, but for the wrong reasons
[2:11:23] <+trustycoyote> So what would happen if you made something OPEN and SHUT?
[2:11:25] <+Sebenoth> just open a path to win.. why focus on the bottom?
[2:11:25] <+Jaysky> Are we counting sheep?
[2:11:44] <+TheMattman1313> move them before open
[2:11:49] <bevyrage> to get the right staggering you have to use the water
[2:11:50] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Could you try removing the water to the left of win. Might be able to set up a "___ is win" sorta deal by layering objects and text
[2:11:51] <Futurecity10> Plague, push baba key up to the top
[2:12:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Brain is stop
[2:12:03] <+Fireking1099> I know how to do this now
[2:12:05] <Futurecity10> That will off set it by one
[2:12:09] <Corencio> zoneThink
[2:12:10] <Futurecity10> Or not
[2:12:14] <Futurecity10> I'm just stupid
[2:12:45] <Sunstalker> Oh, you can sacrifice a key for a water square?
[2:12:50] <bevyrage> ... wait are you able to loop around the edge of the screen if you go left or right, top or down?
[2:12:52] <kingmorsluciscaelum> can you push text through water
[2:12:53] <+SirGO0SE> UNGA BUNGA
[2:12:56] <s1rcuit> @PlagueOfGripes how did you break that water at the end?
[2:13:01] <+Fireking1099> @mods rules on @ ing plag?
[2:13:20] <Corencio> Water is stop. Can't push anything through it.
[2:13:30] <Corencio> What?
[2:13:32] <kingmorsluciscaelum> grammar is good
[2:13:40] <SoFarFetched> @Fireking1099 no mods currently,just nightbot
[2:13:42] <+trustycoyote> Talk it out. What were you thinking?
[2:13:57] <Corencio> The game might surprise you with ideas you don't think will work
[2:13:59] <+Fireking1099> Is there a way that you can move 2 on one item and another?
[2:14:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> CommanderSqueaks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! I'd help you, but I spent 30 minutes on a puzzle in the water Guardian in Breath of the Wild, puzzles no good for me.
[2:15:04] <supersugoisenpai1> I was so tempted to cheat when I did this puzzle
[2:15:25] <Alayric> It's a hard one
[2:15:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> How far into the game is this puzzle?
[2:15:42] <falineth> that was kinda close to the solution
[2:15:54] <+Fireking1099> @PlagueOfGripes the key is you want blank is you and win, but how would you get blank is you in the same row in the same column as win, there is a way
[2:16:12] <+ShinHadokenman> I think I get it
[2:16:12] <DrkJP520> What if you break the water to the left of "WIN" and push in something and "IS"
[2:16:28] <Neryl_> If "Baba is You and Win" is made, do you win from doing that? Or can you just never touch yourself?
[2:16:50] <Corencio> This is a bonus level in the second world
[2:17:05] <+ShinHadokenman> Can you push the whole sentence?
[2:17:12] <+ShinHadokenman> oh you can
[2:17:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Brain is stop
[2:17:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Baba....
[2:17:40] <Corencio> Ack, that's almost it
[2:17:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BRAIN is STOP
[2:18:01] <T_Sasquatch> Try everything, yolo
[2:18:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TACO IS YUM
[2:18:15] <@Nightbot> @ZComiX -> Come on! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[2:18:26] <Coystick> Oh I get it
[2:18:28] <s1rcuit> break the left water with key
[2:18:35] <Coystick> just kidding wtf is baba
[2:18:51] <falineth> @s1rcuit ca'nt push it without being it
[2:18:56] <Corencio> Baba is Baba
[2:19:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> WATER is SLUT <3
[2:19:07] <T_Sasquatch> MAYBE don't give hints in a puzzle stream
[2:19:11] <+ShinHadokenman> I think I might get it, open the water above the win then push the sentence down into the hole, but that only works if you can push the whole sentence horizontal
[2:19:13] <EuropanLamprey> Solved it, Plague is super on the wrong track
[2:19:14] <+Fireking1099> the solution is you want "blank is you and win", but how would you get "blank is you" in the same column as "win", there is a way, I fixed my grammar
[2:19:16] <+Sebenoth> why did you delete water to the right of a condition, win can never be the start of a phrase
[2:19:17] <falineth> ooh thats close
[2:19:27] <zamzoph> I just got here and I think I see the solution already
[2:19:28] <ZComiX> Baba not Sheep?!
[2:19:29] <ZComiX> 0
[2:19:31] <copyritetm> baba is a sheep, thats why he goes Ba Ba
[2:19:39] <Corencio> What is Plague's policy on giving hints?
[2:19:39] <s1rcuit> I think Baba is a sheep, cuz "ba ba black sheep"
[2:19:44] <+Bane_Kaikyo> KEY IS FLAG AND OPEN.... Oh wait but it's not push then
[2:19:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BOP IS
[2:19:53] <Corencio> Right? Sheep makes more sense to me
[2:19:54] <+FadingEmber> Can you move the Baba is you above the water?
[2:19:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> TWIST IT
[2:19:55] <Coystick> Baba is a sheep, rabbit-preachers must be purged
[2:19:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:20:04] <bevyrage> wait wait plague, what if you open up the opposite side of the water from where yah did in this instance?
[2:20:08] <zamzoph> oh, the key can't be pushed
[2:20:13] <+ChilArlequin> I have returned with coffee and half a cinnabon. glad to see I haven't missed the solution
[2:20:15] <bevyrage> that'd give you the space you'd need right?
[2:20:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> <3
[2:20:28] <+SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:20:28] <s1rcuit> what about pushing win into the left water and doing key is win?
[2:20:32] <oruandrew> LUL
[2:20:39] <+AbnormalVoid> just win 4Head
[2:20:46] <copyritetm> Key and baba is you?
[2:20:49] <ZComiX> CCan you push the key whern you make it OPEN?
[2:21:00] <Corencio> Baba is the key to all this
[2:21:06] <+FadingEmber> are we allowed to help?
[2:21:12] <+Bane_Kaikyo> @s1rcuit naw, water is stop
[2:21:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> Perhaps go to a new level and come back to this?
[2:21:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> BABA is CONTROL
[2:21:30] <EuropanLamprey> God, I shouldn't have opened up Baba and solved it myself, this has now become painful
[2:21:46] <+FoogUwU> "key is open and win" after opening left of water?
[2:21:55] <zamzoph> Which level is this? I want to play it myself
[2:21:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @EuropanLamprey Is it really that easy?
[2:22:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Are we all just big dum dums?
[2:22:25] <+ChilArlequin> baba is us and dumb
[2:22:28] <wsintai> @CommanderSqueaks I mean yes, that's why we're here
[2:22:37] <Corencio> This could be it
[2:22:41] <EuropanLamprey> It's counter-intuitive, I just opened it up because I thought of a solution watching and wanted to test it
[2:22:58] <+FoogUwU> "key is open and win"
[2:23:03] <Corencio> You have enough words to do it
[2:23:07] <EuropanLamprey> Plague is actually kinda close right now
[2:23:11] <ZComiX> Ehy not sink the key on ther over side of the openningA?
[2:23:14] <+ShinHadokenman> Wait kinda
[2:23:21] <+Fireking1099> @PlagueOfGripes make an upside down L with "key and baba is you" above the water and using all 3 move the L over
[2:23:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That might work
[2:23:29] <s1rcuit> try it
[2:23:29] <DarkSideCow> push and in hole
[2:23:34] <+Sebenoth> Plague has gained more insight, his mind is lined with eyes
[2:23:44] <falineth> well that would prevent you from having a key
[2:23:51] <+AbnormalVoid> if you could get the statement horizontal
[2:24:01] <Corencio> Well
[2:24:01] <+frobeards> so close
[2:24:02] <EuropanLamprey> Super close
[2:24:07] <falineth> so close
[2:24:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[2:24:12] <Mr_Strut> because KEY is win
[2:24:13] <+Sebenoth> you made key is win, but theres no key now
[2:24:14] <Corencio> Because Flag is not win
[2:24:16] <+arcturusblade> because flag isn't win
[2:24:17] <Mr_Strut> but now key is flag
[2:24:18] <Corencio> Key is win. And flag.
[2:24:18] <ZComiX> FLAG ISNT WIN PLAGUE!
[2:24:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> XD
[2:24:21] <+SirGO0SE> LUL LUL
[2:24:21] <+Fireking1099> @PlagueOfGripes you had it
[2:24:21] <ahaegotrigger> LUL
[2:24:23] <Gibbles1337> because that makes key is flag, and key is win
[2:24:24] <ZComiX> KEY IS WIN
[2:24:25] <+FoogUwU> im tellin ya. "key is open and win"
[2:24:26] <oruandrew> aw jeez
[2:24:26] <+trustycoyote> Boooo
[2:24:28] <+Nobrev> try open and win
[2:24:34] <+Bane_Kaikyo> KEY IS WHEN..... BUT THERE IS NO KEY THO
[2:24:37] <ZComiX> WHERE KEY PLAGUE???
[2:24:39] <+AbnormalVoid> how can this beeeee
[2:24:40] <falineth> only 1 tile off
[2:24:42] <DarkSideCow> move flag an push u
[2:24:43] <EuropanLamprey> If only there is something else that could be in the flag's position
[2:24:44] <shevan123> no key is win not flag
[2:24:53] <DoctorToast_> "nice try smartass" - game
[2:25:02] <YakumoYomi> But Baba ceases to be!
[2:25:02] <+Fireking1099> key is open and win
[2:25:07] <+ChilArlequin> flag is key and win? I dunno
[2:25:12] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> good good
[2:25:14] <EuropanLamprey> @DoctorToast_ "Nice Try Dumbass: The Game"
[2:25:23] <+Sebenoth> dew it!
[2:25:24] <+Fireking1099> @PlagueOfGripes key is open and win
[2:25:27] <DoctorToast_> ha
[2:25:27] <Corencio> (open)
[2:25:34] <vaydoze> i don't think i've ever failed to understand a game this hard
[2:25:35] <%SilverRoddo> Baba’s one step closer to the edge
[2:25:37] <EuropanLamprey> Your brain is running out of Ki
[2:25:52] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Open and Win perhaps?
[2:26:02] <ZComiX> That OPEN is pretty lonley Plauge
[2:26:07] <Mr_Strut> baba win
[2:26:07] <+2sappy> Key is open and win?
[2:26:09] <spardanwarrior> Use a verb as a connector?
[2:26:18] <DrkJP520> I'm guessing no backseating?
[2:26:24] <Corencio> Your mind is open
[2:26:24] <+FadingEmber> maybe from the top?
[2:26:33] <VermillionLunacy> KEY is OPEN and WIN
[2:26:35] <EuropanLamprey> Omg, Plague is giving me an ulcer
[2:26:37] <T_Sasquatch> Loool
[2:26:38] <+Fireking1099> key is open AND WIN
[2:26:44] <Corencio> Open is a word that can fill space
[2:26:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> Baba is Alcohol, Alcohol is Drink.
[2:26:57] <spardanwarrior> Use open as a linker so that key can be a key and also be win?
[2:26:59] <copyritetm> I think if you turn into two keys, you can push two word blocks at the same time, allowing you to move is left and right
[2:26:59] <s1rcuit> you can do it still
[2:27:02] <falineth> why move key if it is win
[2:27:08] <VermillionLunacy> this is painful to watch
[2:27:18] <Corencio> That is what Baba does
[2:27:23] <ShadBo> lol he had it
[2:27:26] <+ChilArlequin> @EuropanLamprey I think you mean.. aneurysm. ulcers are a gastrointestinal thing
[2:27:33] <SadisticAphid60> this is one of those indie games with the small, white animal protagonist
[2:27:37] <Corencio> Open is just a state
[2:27:37] <SadisticAphid60> with black eyes
[2:27:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yeyeye
[2:27:44] <EuropanLamprey> What I'm feeling is in my ass right now
[2:27:45] <copyritetm> lol
[2:27:45] <+ChilArlequin> WIN
[2:27:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> WAIT I MISSED IT
