[0:05:41] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! so close to 5 years i can taste it.hope you're feeling better Plague. good work with that mgs5 video. It was nice seeing a balanced examination of what that game was in a bubble.
[0:05:50] <%Badpest> all good
[0:06:01] <YakumoYomi> It is. The performance issues are a drag, but at the most egregious ones seem to happen during moments where you can't move (Musou attacks, weakpoint finishers, etc.).
[0:06:04] <Locus_V> Hello there Plague, how's the game so far ?
[0:06:11] <layZman> @PlagueOfGripes Hi Plague, just wanted to say hello because I'm a huge fan of your souls videos both the parody and the playthrough, as well as your recent phantom pain video. You're one of the most eloquent entertainers I've come to enjoy.
[0:06:17] <%ForlornCarton> Thanks for the sub!
[0:06:30] <TheTakkster> @PlagueOfGripes Quality dips here and there and there's a tiny bit of hitching. The latter might just be the switch
[0:06:38] <AgentZombieMan> No problem, @Explodincatz
[0:06:46] <jacewolf_is_the_best> qwertiSip
[0:07:10] <$theshadowproducer> holy shit. I cant wait to watch this game fall apart likw it did for me
[0:07:43] <SoFarFetched> I didn't realize you were on here for 5 years. But then I realize with art streams it makes a lot of sense.
[0:07:58] <AgentZombieMan> Just happy to see you being alive
[0:08:10] <+Gogogolem> phatom pain video?

[0:10:13] <atomgenerator> Hello!, first time catching your stream!
[0:10:15] <Dao_Puppy> I honestly just looked for a yelling emote as a reaction to that, realized what I was doing, and hung my head in shame.
[0:10:17] <$theshadowproducer> then carrying on
[0:10:18] <%thechodericky> Yeah plague it’s the cats fault
[0:10:18] <AgentZombieMan> Terrible timing, Peach
[0:10:21] <layZman> it died as it lived, warm
[0:10:36] <TheTakkster> Peach just hoping for background noise. Gets dead cat chat
[0:10:37] <SoFarFetched> I always worry cause my neighborhood has a lot of cats.
[0:11:11] <+hornydino_> farm life makes you numb it seems
[0:11:12] <+arancet> just a way to push people to sub at once
[0:11:12] <%thechodericky> How does this game compare to say dynasty warrior?
[0:11:14] <$theshadowproducer> is good
[0:11:15] <Laecerelius> Hype train exists to push people to sub more often
[0:11:22] <atomgenerator> and is this game good?
[0:11:24] <Dao_Puppy> ...now let me tell you about the time a mother moved a fresh litter of kittens into a radiator fan chamber...
[0:11:27] <AgentZombieMan> Hype-Train actually causes your channel to be deleted if it hits level 5
[0:11:30] <MichaelDood> Maybe it's just in a coma. HahaShrugLeft HahaBall HahaShrugRight
[0:11:33] <atomgenerator> i had a ton of fun in the first one
[0:11:44] <Laecerelius> I've liked it more than other Warriors games
[0:11:55] <$theshadowproducer> this game did have a lot more small management than I expected
[0:12:08] <Laecerelius> The first Hyrule Warriors felt super grindy even for a Warriors game
[0:12:24] <%Explodincatz> Ive been catching up on the Star Trek vods, really enjoy u guys perspective on the series
[0:12:34] <%thechodericky> I tried the demo and it really didn’t sell me on it, yet I love dynasty warriors so I still kinda wanna get it

[0:14:02] <@PeachSaliva> I am sad about the cat.
[0:14:19] <atomgenerator> is the story good or is it "meh" like in the first one?
[0:14:37] <SoFarFetched> go hug elmo paige
[0:14:41] <SoFarFetched> I should actually hug my cats too.
[0:14:49] <AgentZombieMan> I mean at least it was quick, right?
[0:15:06] <+arancet> i like mipha a lot but she seems a bit weak
[0:15:15] <AgentZombieMan> "It's fine Peach, we have more"
[0:15:20] <+TheSynthwaveRacer> Plague you are a creature born of perfection
[0:15:40] <streamlurkerman101> I'm late, what happened to the cat?
[0:15:45] <+Gondab> Paige should look at the 'Cats where they shouldn't be' Twitter.
[0:15:59] <AgentZombieMan> Just like the kitten!
[0:16:03] <Samex_Comex> His backyard is like that Adventure time episode with all the cats with boxes
[0:16:16] <MichaelDood> Link should start a Patreon
[0:16:22] <%thechodericky> @streamlurkerman101 it committed suicide
[0:16:42] <%Scarnehu> @peachsaliva hey Paige!! how are you doing? your back stop exploding?
[0:16:45] <@PeachSaliva> @streamlurkerman101 Plague ate the cat because he is a bad, bad man.
[0:16:57] <MarylandJutsu> oh noooooo
[0:17:12] <@PeachSaliva> Now he will become as cat.
[0:17:15] <AgentZombieMan> I have no sympathy for birds that get hit by cars
[0:17:16] <MarylandJutsu> actual bad man plague

[0:18:43] <Laecerelius> Yeah kidna odd that they show them to you this early when you basically have to do them after finishing everything
[0:18:57] <LunarRemix> Maybe there's postgame content
[0:19:06] <%Scarnehu> only 4.2? that's pretty good for air to air
[0:19:22] <AgentZombieMan> Eaten by coyotes?
[0:19:26] <@PeachSaliva> Yeah, that’s how it was on my old farm.
[0:19:29] <streamlurkerman101> "missing"
[0:19:37] <Samex_Comex> They are on a quest
[0:19:40] <YakumoYomi> There will almost certainly be DLC, given Nintendo's past Musou games. Those rewards will probably be more valuable then.
[0:19:44] <SoFarFetched> Yeah when nature is involved,many things can happen.
[0:19:51] <MarylandJutsu> Plague has an army of cats like the wicked witch of the west: go my preeties, go
[0:20:06] <+Draylle> yes! Purah is best girl

[0:21:22] <AgentZombieMan> Durability Systems: Best Systems
[0:21:27] <%Scarnehu> sounds about right
[0:21:55] <AgentZombieMan> Like the clubbing kind?
[0:22:32] <%Scarnehu> so like a worse version of parasite eve 1?
[0:22:48] <AgentZombieMan> How could you make it worse?
[0:22:56] <YakumoYomi> Sounds very similar to the first Hyrule Warriors' weapon effects system
[0:23:54] <+silvery_cricket> OMG
[0:24:01] <+silvery_cricket> ITS THAT DUMB SYSTEM FROM SAO
[0:24:12] <+silvery_cricket> Feed your starting sword
[0:24:47] <AgentZombieMan> Like Michael Jackson "Bad"?
[0:25:01] <+arancet> im still early, whats the best seals?
[0:25:13] <%Explodincatz> looks like a gacha system type grind

[0:25:37] <AgentZombieMan> Pinnipeds @arancet

[0:31:24] <MarylandJutsu> the chicken no one likes
[0:31:47] <OToole42> So do you have a "main" so far?
[0:32:12] <+silvery_cricket> When is Dark Souls Warriors? Where you fight in the war of the dragons?
[0:32:13] <MichaelDood> KomodoHype
[0:32:16] <LunarRemix> Sounds just fine
[0:32:16] <bettysharkface> Game seems a little quiet right now
[0:32:19] <%thechodericky> Does the story even matter? It’s a Zelda game I think I got it
[0:32:20] <bettysharkface> Yeah
[0:32:25] <SpeedFetishist> english dub mixing kinda wack

[0:34:02] <+silvery_cricket> Its so weird this is the post windwaker timeline.
[0:34:40] <+silvery_cricket> Yeah but what about the hero of trains Plague?
[0:34:46] <velgaduere> the Zelda timeline was literally cobbled together because fans asked for one. there was barely ever a premise for it
[0:34:49] <LunarRemix> It doesn't add much to the story or the characters
[0:35:00] <bettysharkface> Elephant mech. We zoids now.
[0:35:06] <+silvery_cricket> The Zelda timeline is fun
[0:35:07] <%Scarnehu> at-at section?!?!?!
[0:35:27] <YakumoYomi> Spirit Tracks?
[0:35:32] <AgentZombieMan> I'm the Hero of the Hype-Train
[0:35:40] <+silvery_cricket> Yeah man Spirit Tracks is in the same timeline as this.
[0:35:46] <bettysharkface> Elephant doooooot
[0:35:46] <+ZombieDWolf> at this point the zelda timeline is wack and the only game that matters is botw
[0:36:08] <+Daxalog> Lost Planet 3!?
[0:36:23] <+silvery_cricket> Like Spirit Tracks takes place before this.
[0:36:25] <bettysharkface> This UI is kind of a lot though
[0:36:34] <+silvery_cricket> Its really dumb and I love it.
[0:36:41] <+Daxalog> This is so fucked up
[0:36:43] <bettysharkface> I can't see what's happening
[0:36:50] <YakumoYomi> Technically speaking, BotW is supposed to be so far into the future of everything else that converges into it
[0:37:11] <velgaduere> and by "difficult" do you mean "stupidly stat inflated and unfun"?
[0:37:29] <velgaduere> like some Warriors titles...
[0:37:39] <YakumoYomi> @velgaduere You know it. It's the Koei Tecmo way
[0:37:43] <bettysharkface> Aw look at the little Mipha art though, that's a cute picture
[0:37:50] <%WoRabbit> WoRabbit subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! what is that cursed thing in the corner, and why do I find it hilarious?
[0:37:52] <+silvery_cricket> THIS IS A ZELDA GAME
[0:37:57] <@PeachSaliva> Mipha is so cute
[0:37:57] <+ZombieDWolf> i hope a switch pro does come out cause as much fun as this game is. the runs very poorly
[0:37:59] <+silvery_cricket> A PUZZLE GAME SERIES

[0:38:32] <Samex_Comex> we never got to sex goat
[0:38:42] <+silvery_cricket> Does this game even have puzzles?

[0:39:09] <+ClericOfSparda> NICE, 1 FPS
[0:39:11] <bettysharkface> FIsh eggs o no
[0:39:14] <+ZombieDWolf> you aint wrong tho
[0:39:21] <velgaduere> @ClericOfSparda more than I was expecting tbh
[0:39:26] <@PeachSaliva> @sunstalker no, it’s my turn to be Gief’s cushion :(
[0:39:32] <zk_nails> is it your spirit animal?
[0:40:02] <+silvery_cricket> Why does it look old?
[0:40:15] <OToole42> its only a model
[0:40:16] <+silvery_cricket> Shouldnt this thing look like freshly carved stone?
[0:40:55] <OToole42> I just want to use sidon's abs as a pillow
[0:41:19] <+deviljhojho_> I've heard this game really does a number on the switch
[0:41:25] <SoFarFetched> @PeachSaliva then you will slowly become a skeleton
[0:41:27] <+arancet> no, the divine beasts are SUPER old, they were just first found during this time
[0:41:40] <MichaelDood> The never ending train of characters LUL
[0:41:41] <SpeedFetishist> is this the battle where link eats it or is that later?
[0:41:41] <+Daxalog> Apart of this kinda makes the implied war seem kinda lamer than I thought.
[0:41:59] <+ClericOfSparda> Probably later
[0:42:12] <+silvery_cricket> MASTADON
[0:42:13] <YakumoYomi> @deviljhojho_ It gets pretty bad during some Musou attacks and weakpoint finishers, but it's not unplayable. Seems like splitscreen is where things get really bad
[0:42:41] <+deviljhojho_> @YakumoYomi i stick to docked so it should be soldi enuff
[0:42:48] <+ClericOfSparda> Wait, wasn't Sidon supposed to be a kid at this point?
[0:42:54] <SpeedFetishist> time travel
[0:43:01] <+arancet> @ClericOfSparda yes, time shenanigans
[0:43:01] <+silvery_cricket> Is there a part in this where you play as the bad guys like in Hyrule Warriors 1?
[0:43:07] <+ClericOfSparda> GDI
[0:43:19] <velgaduere> don't you guys like TIME TRAVEL PLOT
[0:43:25] <+silvery_cricket> yes
[0:43:42] <%Scarnehu> just like my kingdom hearts
[0:43:44] <MichaelDood> Man, if I got to see my kid self... 🤔
[0:43:55] <+ZombieDWolf> @silvery_cricket kind of
[0:44:00] <pilllowofbees> Id kick his ass
[0:44:05] <+silvery_cricket> Oh man what if Lanacia shows up?
[0:44:05] <velgaduere> "oh no, we don't have enough characters in this time period for our musou game... bring out the HAMFIST."
[0:44:05] <+Gondab> yes, I do love 13 sentinels: ageis rim.
[0:44:22] <+silvery_cricket> And she is like "You ruined the timelines"
[0:45:07] <velgaduere> "you ruined this story further with more extreme contrivances! I didn't think it was possible!"
[0:45:14] <+ZombieDWolf> the draw distance is 3ft
[0:45:37] <zk_nails> how would Plague cook a korok?
[0:45:38] <+AlarStormbringer> Aww yeah, Plague is streaming.
[0:45:55] <SpeedFetishist> having you lose in the end if the musou game where you are super overpowered is kinda weird though, so I get why they did this
[0:46:49] <+teh_rawk> who did you main in hyrule warriors @PlagueOfGripes
[0:46:57] <+silvery_cricket> Plague would you play a Dark Souls Warrior game? Or would that be to much of kicking a dead horse for you?
[0:47:08] <+ZombieDWolf> teba is the best character in the game btw
[0:47:15] <+deviljhojho_> i guess zelda is all in for timeline shenanigans anyways
[0:47:19] <+AlarStormbringer> Flap flap flap flap.
[0:47:24] <@PeachSaliva> He is basically Falco
[0:47:28] <@PeachSaliva> But no balls
[0:47:39] <+deviljhojho_> Ken doll falco tomatoPunished
[0:47:50] <velgaduere> at least Falco hasn't died chibikSmug
[0:47:59] <@PeachSaliva> Damn that’s cold
[0:48:05] <+silvery_cricket> Could you imagine a Dark Souls Warriors and you are just doing stylish combos on Seeth
[0:48:12] <velgaduere> @PeachSaliva just like Revali's corpse!
[0:48:43] <+deviljhojho_> i like the goron guy because i like gorons
[0:48:46] <Jinrya_Geki> cause hes a loner part of a team
[0:48:47] <+deviljhojho_> crikIQ
[0:48:54] <SpeedFetishist> he's the sasuke
[0:49:14] <Jinrya_Geki> why is an asshole bragger lone part of a team if he thinks hes so superior
[0:49:15] <+commanderclaw> I call them podcast games. Turn on some music or a podcast and just chill
[0:49:29] <+silvery_cricket> Hyrule Warriors 1 has a bit to much running back and forth fighting over bases, even for a warriors game.
[0:49:40] <+Daxalog> I tend to avoid these types of Podcast games
[0:49:47] <+AlarStormbringer> God damn, Link is a badass in this.
[0:49:50] <+deviljhojho_> frame hell
[0:50:12] <LunarRemix> But is everyone at least viable or is there any character who's weak?
[0:50:28] <velgaduere> I believe the lack of online multi is exactly why I didn't buy this one, and precisely why I was so disappointed with Hyrule Warriors
[0:50:40] <Jinrya_Geki> plagueGripes
[0:51:12] <+silvery_cricket> I like Hyrule Warriors but its so weird that it even exists since Zelda is a puzzle game series, it be like Professor Layton Warriors.
[0:51:50] <+ZombieDWolf> that be a spin off for you
[0:52:26] <+ZombieDWolf> nintendo and online dont mix anyway
[0:52:26] <Jinrya_Geki> is Malon in this game?
[0:52:35] <+ZombieDWolf> no
[0:52:40] <velgaduere> it's not really uncommon for a game series to have a spinoff in a completely different genre
[0:52:42] <Jinrya_Geki> wtf awful game
[0:52:58] <SpeedFetishist> the ost in this game is great
[0:52:59] <LunarRemix> Fi from Skyward?
[0:53:14] <moonlitdream> VOMIT NOW
[0:53:18] <Jinrya_Geki> malon is the best girl in the entire zelda franchise
[0:53:23] <+AlarStormbringer> Impa's attacks are really cool. haruka8Happy
[0:53:29] <+ZombieDWolf> this game mainly only has people from botw
[0:53:32] <%Garden_Hills> wow
[0:53:43] <+silvery_cricket> Mipha "gurgle gurugle gurgle gurgle gurgle" Random Soldier "Thanks fish lady"
[0:54:06] <+abrupt_abe> Impa strong
[0:54:18] <kachucho> this feels like what blade and soul should have been
[0:54:26] <+AlarStormbringer> Badass ninja shit. The hand signs are amusing.
[0:54:47] <SpeedFetishist> wonder if they gonna bring that to botw2, elemental guardians
[0:54:51] <+arancet> i thought at first she had to do different y moves to get different symbols, but no, can just spam one, seems too easy
[0:55:01] <+ZombieDWolf> if they lose their legs that meter wont go away
[0:55:24] <+abrupt_abe> Hope BOTW 2 actually uses a similar wand system instead of poor weapons
[0:55:35] <+AlarStormbringer> Magic mega guns, got it.
[0:55:40] <%thechodericky> It wouldn’t be a warriors game unless the frame rate dies occasionally
[0:56:15] <Samex_Comex> Fish milk
[0:56:27] <MichaelDood> Open sesame! lytSHADES
[0:56:28] <+AlarStormbringer> THEY GAVE HER THE NARUTO RUN snuffy5OmegaLUL
[0:57:05] <+ZombieDWolf> frog
[0:57:10] <mellorolo> channel strike???
[0:57:20] <+AlarStormbringer> She is a giant Naruto reference with LoZ flavor and I love it.
[0:57:27] <Jinrya_Geki> is this really a sequel to botw when his weapons and shields aren't instantly broken after 5 hits?
[0:57:34] <Jinrya_Geki> prequel
[0:57:47] <+AlarStormbringer> Yeah, it's a prequel Jinrya
[0:58:05] <+ZombieDWolf> spinoffs get to do what they want
[0:58:09] <Jinrya_Geki> but all his stuff isn't broken yet
[0:58:33] <+abrupt_abe> Electric needs environmental effects like rain or the enemy standing in water
[0:58:42] <mellorolo> dont you love impa x)
[0:58:43] <+AlarStormbringer> Because they're working with actual good gear instead of crappy salvage.
[0:58:47] <LunarRemix> Good catch
[0:58:56] <Jinrya_Geki> it's really the only thing I hated in botw was how fast every weapon broke
[1:00:05] <sidslab> is this multiplayer???
[1:00:23] <Jinrya_Geki> even dark souls 2 weapons didn't break as fast as botw weapons
[1:00:25] <+Gondab> Ohh yeah, and those legendary weapons breaking after you beat the divine beasts mean they are such 'crappy salvage'
[1:00:53] <+AlarStormbringer> Alternatively, the corruption/curse makes everything shittier and break easily.
[1:00:54] <mellorolo> ive never played BotW, should i follow it up after i finish this game?
[1:01:04] <+AlarStormbringer> So here at the start of the corruption, things are still normal.
[1:01:40] <+Gondab> we get diet Link in botw
[1:01:59] <Jinrya_Geki> discount link in botw, lunk
[1:02:10] <+AlarStormbringer> He died and then had a century long nap, cut him some slack.
[1:02:28] <YakumoYomi> @mellorolo If you like. Without getting into too many spoilers, this game diverges events that were established in BotW
[1:02:32] <Jinrya_Geki> no cause doom guy was 100% after a long rest
[1:02:38] <Katakumo> exp?
[1:02:52] <SpeedFetishist> good for building up special
[1:03:01] <+AlarStormbringer> girldmSad
[1:03:41] <Jinrya_Geki> whats everyones favourite character from rhe zelda franchise?
[1:04:15] <+Gondab> shortstack imp midna
[1:04:36] <+ZombieDWolf> bird daddy Kass
[1:04:36] <YakumoYomi> Does Impa have a birthmark on her ass as well?
[1:04:39] <+AlarStormbringer> Those ARE pretty good, but I imagine in a fighting game you wanna go for what's the most satisfying to play.
[1:04:41] <LunarRemix> Japan is REALLY into those
[1:04:51] <SpeedFetishist> paya is hinata, impa is tsunade
[1:05:04] <+commanderclaw> Ah yes, the doormat archetype
[1:05:37] <LunarRemix> You don't have a personality and ambition? Well sigh me the fuck up!
[1:05:56] <LunarRemix> Sign*
[1:06:05] <Jinrya_Geki> is there a lu bu of this game?
[1:06:14] <+AlarStormbringer> Link casually murdering a billion enemies.
[1:06:24] <YakumoYomi> He seems to be moving again, so I'm inclined to believe you
[1:06:37] <SpeedFetishist> Sooga, who is Kohga's apprentice is kinda the Lu Bu
[1:06:49] <SpeedFetishist> but he's not hard at all to beat
[1:07:36] <+ZombieDWolf> hylians shrink when they age. must suck
[1:07:48] <YakumoYomi> Japan loves making people suddenly become dwarves when they become elderly
[1:07:52] <danteftw20> japanese people tend to shrink dramatically in anime/games just look at gintama
[1:07:53] <Katakumo> japan likes to make old people tiny no matter how tall they were before
[1:08:20] <+AlarStormbringer> Midoriya's mom in My Hero Academia shrinking as she gets fatter for some reason was so weird.
[1:08:30] <Jinrya_Geki> well why does zeldas dad stay tall as fuck
[1:08:47] <vonmaultke> Their spinal column collapsed
[1:09:31] <vonmaultke> Well the joints between them do
[1:09:37] <YakumoYomi> @AlarStormbringer I think the "canon" explanation was that she felt regret for not believing in Midoriya...so she shrunk into a thicc dwarf, for some reason
[1:09:38] <Katakumo> @Jinrya_Geki He always gets killed before he turns into a decrepit old man
[1:09:55] <+AlarStormbringer> @YakumoYomi ...das weird yo.
[1:09:59] <Jinrya_Geki> ah true
[1:10:18] <ZeterZero > Just stopping by to say I love you plague. I've always loved you...
[1:10:20] <LunarRemix> The king from Zelda CD was super huge
[1:10:30] <+AlarStormbringer> nyannBlush LOVE CONFESSION nyannBlush
[1:10:51] <Jinrya_Geki> havel the rock?
[1:11:09] <Jinrya_Geki> bottom floor of a locked tower?
[1:11:32] <ZeterZero > <3
[1:11:43] <+Gondab> gets the golden poop ring when beaten
[1:13:41] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:13:45] <+ZombieDWolf> end game takes a while if you do the side stuff after every mission
[1:14:21] <+arancet> its annoying the they portray revali here as not just cocky, but insulting to everyone else
[1:14:39] <+AlarStormbringer> Ya ha ha!
[1:15:20] <Solokaldaka> now that the scavenger hunt is over the murder begins PridePog
[1:16:18] <+AlarStormbringer> Revali acting like he's hot shit compared to Link.
[1:16:31] <thatfeel> Just tuning in..How's this game so far?
[1:17:40] <Katakumo> holy crap. the power of a lvl 71... comparedto ur lvl 40s
[1:18:17] <kachucho> is anyone gonna join you in this game later?
[1:20:04] <Solokaldaka> fighting games and beat'em ups are close in there handling of tech
[1:21:29] <+arancet> not gonna get on with woolie and play some guilty gear?
[1:22:16] <clintsterlock> psaWrong
[1:22:19] <+commanderclaw> I liked Soul Calibur back in the day. The weapon based combat and 3d did a lot to help me grok it
[1:22:44] <YakumoYomi> Jumping off walls is a good way to get airborne for those enemies whose weakpoint gauges get exposed by aerial attacks (like moblins)
[1:23:49] <+commanderclaw> I like the BotW Goron clubswords. Unique while not being totally impractical
[1:24:47] <Solokaldaka> bridge chan D:
[1:25:17] <ChungusQuest> such a rebel
[1:25:31] <YakumoYomi> He a asshole
[1:25:58] <Samex_Comex> Fuck you ravioli
[1:26:28] <biglomix> Jesus Particle effects the game
[1:26:35] <Solokaldaka> Is this better than the other hyrule warriors?
[1:27:27] <+arancet> at least we're getting the persona one
[1:27:32] <biglomix> oops had to make a backup copy
[1:27:43] <YakumoYomi> I'd say it's better than the base game, but the first Hyrule Warriors has the benefit of four years of DLC
[1:27:59] <SoFarFetched> "YOU created Mario? DMCA!!"
[1:28:05] <Sunstalker> Senator Thillis is trying to pass a law to make it a felony to stream copyrighted material, upping it to a jail sentence. rooBlank
[1:28:13] <tanarath> They (some assholes) want to make it a federal crime to stream copywrighted anything
[1:28:16] <biglomix> Do you think Japanese Devs are just terrified of American Copywrite Law?
[1:28:26] <YakumoYomi> It's the best selling Musou game in history, apparently
[1:28:34] <vonmaultke> Speaking of DMCA, you hear about that attachment to a bill that targets streamers?
[1:30:06] <ConspireRPG> Bullshit inventory management!? It IS a botw game. LUL
[1:30:52] <+BurkeBigsby> Classic Warriors gameplay. Get rid of trying anything different, just use fast attacks with low commitment.
[1:31:34] <Solokaldaka> HahaBall thanks for reminding me of the horrors of reality plague
[1:31:42] <+BlockingDisabled> lol, like Dems care
[1:31:56] <Sunstalker> Nah, there's assholes on the Dems too being paid by the same group handing Thillis his bribes
[1:32:04] <ChungusQuest> must-pass spending bill season is always fun
[1:32:58] <biglomix> Oh that bear is weird when you remember him
[1:33:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:35:18] <Solokaldaka> gulfciTyGhastly why do you think we are here plague, we have time to waste
[1:35:27] <ChungusQuest> Like we won't be wasting it in an even worse fashion after you go.
[1:35:39] <vonmaultke> Recovered? monkaS did Plague catch the plague?
[1:35:40] <kachucho> quest for huge?
[1:36:31] <+BurkeBigsby> Link is honestly the best character. Bow and Arrow trigger weakness guage again, great single target attacks.
[1:36:57] <biglomix> It could always be worse, your name could be Paige
[1:37:09] <@PeachSaliva> ☹️
[1:37:14] <bettysharkface> Getting sick from stress is forreal
[1:37:19] <bettysharkface> Aw, aw Paige
[1:37:23] <biglomix> oops
[1:37:30] <ZeterZero > Anxiety SUCKS!
[1:37:40] <ZeterZero > I hate it.
[1:38:14] <ZeterZero > I've been doing better, but there for a bit it was bad. Still hits me sometimes.
[1:38:41] <biglomix> You learn never to go to bed early, thats when your mind betrays you
[1:38:48] <+BurkeBigsby> Getting flurry rush at cinematic 23fps. LUL
[1:38:50] <ZeterZero > On a lighter note Cyberpunk is out. Time to make a big titty hacker girl. With abs and freckles!
[1:39:12] <ZeterZero > Very fair.
[1:39:34] <SoFarFetched> Poor Ross had to delete his Cyberpunk video showing glitches/bugs cause people were being horribly Toxic in the comments
[1:39:42] <bettysharkface> I am scared of cyberpunk because what if I have the seizures and just never got one until now
[1:39:58] <ZeterZero > I'm impatient though.
[1:40:02] <thatfeel> Its gonna be buggy as hell
[1:40:10] <biglomix> It needs to be Saints Row level of mody mods
[1:40:14] <+TheWe4pon> INB4 Nipple Dicks
[1:40:22] <ZeterZero > I think that's just during the Dreamdance start up.
[1:40:23] <+TheWe4pon> Dick nipples *
[1:40:25] <+BurkeBigsby> Just played for about 2 hours. Could not go back to it ever and be fine.
[1:40:51] <vonmaultke> Weiners the size of a baseball bat, boobies the size of watermelon
[1:40:52] <Sunstalker> Bepis Grande
[1:41:01] <+lordericter> oh wow that thing has a weird face
[1:41:05] <bettysharkface> The only thing that is interesting to me about cyberpunk is Keanu Reeves existing
[1:41:08] <Commander_Deko> it has an epic chin
[1:41:49] <bettysharkface> Feepers
[1:42:03] <bettysharkface> Feepers for sand swamming
[1:42:22] <Sunstalker> rooD Do not eat the Molduga, paige.
[1:42:32] <ZeterZero > I'm looking forward to it, but it takes little to make me happy, except for the times when it takes a lot.
[1:42:35] <vonmaultke> I like the theme of a scummy lowerclass sci-fi, and the idea of ambulance assault teams are great but past that
[1:42:39] <Commander_Deko> Lizalfos just vibing
[1:43:04] <bettysharkface> The theme of feetsies
[1:43:17] <ZeterZero > CONSUME ITS FLESH TO MAKE ITS STRENGTH YOUR OWN!
[1:43:24] <sirthomas2step> yayyyy endangered species is now even further up the list
[1:43:32] <sirthomas2step> harlem shake!
[1:43:37] <ChungusQuest> Who says poaching can't be festive?
[1:43:47] <biglomix> Looks like a giant tempura shrimp
[1:43:53] <@PeachSaliva> @sunstalker u can’t tell me wat to do BibleThump
[1:44:06] <thatfeel> Monster Hunter in a nutshell
[1:44:39] <+arancet> japanese game, so it probably does, they love screwing you with rng
[1:44:42] <+lordericter> oh god I didn't notice the tiny spyro plague
[1:44:54] <+lordericter> that's something else
[1:44:59] <ChungusQuest> I'd buy that image on a shirt
[1:45:06] <sirthomas2step> Spyro Plague wants a treat!
[1:45:12] <bettysharkface> The discord is currently workshopping a new horor
[1:45:15] <bettysharkface> horror*
[1:45:42] <Samex_Comex> We are trying
[1:46:02] <vonmaultke> If monster hunter fixed its hit boxes Kreygasm I don’t care if old timers think it’s heresy
[1:46:08] <bettysharkface> Drach is involved, so probably...
[1:46:14] <bettysharkface> But we'll regret it
[1:48:01] <+ZombieDWolf> spears are grea what
[1:49:51] <ZeterZero > Cheer100
[1:50:10] <%ForlornCarton> Good times
