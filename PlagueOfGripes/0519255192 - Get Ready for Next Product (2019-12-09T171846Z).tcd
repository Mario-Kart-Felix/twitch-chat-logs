[0:01:43] <Daiguiny> Hi Gripes
[0:02:15] <Triblade1992> Hello. Did you see that Ghostbusters trailer? Why can't they take the advice of Dr. Jones from The Last Crusade and "Let is go Indy"
[0:03:01] <+Cook_4_Souls> hi
[0:03:06] <Tiny_Axolotl> Started playing FFXIV again because of you @PlagueOfGripes .
[0:03:08] <Triblade1992> Learned that from Dark Souls 2 and 3 I see
[0:04:03] <Firemane1279> Horrid Bug Creature 1, and Horrid Bug Creature 2, with deadly acid attack. Kappa
[0:04:29] <Triblade1992> I recall that someone actually broke the game early on when they climbed up a wall and resulted in them losing the ability to heal
[0:05:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Jedi are so stupid. I love them
[0:05:29] <Tiny_Axolotl> Because tripple a games are trying to be movies
[0:05:35] <Triblade1992> Eh, I'm fine with that as long as it's a refined experience. Open world tends to have more bugs and glitches and suffer from not having good polish
[0:05:41] <+Captainshoes> Plague, a star wars story.
[0:05:54] <Tiny_Axolotl> or cinematic experiences first games second
[0:05:59] <pakanone12> This game would benefit from a Metal Gear Rising-Esque object destruction.
[0:06:18] <mortelkilll> its also the ugliest planet
[0:06:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> They want to make cinematic stories while dangerously forgotten gameplay
[0:06:22] <Triblade1992> It's why I can't get into Bethesda games since they tend to be more buggy
[0:06:56] <+ConLin_Arts_> Are you a Jedi yet son?
[0:07:14] <OToole42> Hey there champ, are ya winning?
[0:07:15] <Triblade1992> Again, learned that from Dark Souls 2 and 3
[0:07:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Now look. The clones did nothing wrong.
[0:07:40] <+Demonstrandum> Holy shit, a plague stream I can catch on this EU side of the planet! Did I die and go to niche consumer heaven ?
[0:07:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> Especially the ones that killed jedi
[0:07:49] <Puhff> Oh boy, Dathomir...
[0:07:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> So, is this good?
[0:07:58] <Triblade1992> rex and Co were just protecting themselves from that one Jedi in the CLone Wars cartoon @sonofthedeepsouth
[0:08:07] <axivate_> Does Plague like or hate this game? I can't tell
[0:08:13] <mortelkilll> both
[0:08:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Remember the organic chips plot
[0:08:20] <%hgtarras> Is this darthomire?
[0:08:26] <Triblade1992> yes
[0:08:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> God I hate that organic chip in clone wars
[0:08:36] <Puhff> Yeah that's one my biggest complaints with the game, lack on interactibility with the environmnet
[0:08:45] <+ConLin_Arts_> Plague is not a Sith, only they deal in absolutes
[0:08:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> They dont have agency guises
[0:09:19] <Puhff> Yarp
[0:09:27] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[0:09:29] <Triblade1992> LOL
[0:09:33] <%hgtarras> But plague respawn makes really good games
[0:09:36] <pakanone12> LUL
[0:09:39] <+Cook_4_Souls> LOL
[0:09:44] <Tiny_Axolotl> @axivate_ Plague is extremely critical of everything, doesn't necessarily hate the things he critisies though.
[0:09:51] <+ConLin_Arts_> at least traversing seems fun?
[0:09:52] <+Demonstrandum> Can you imagine how many padawans smash their own face in when learning force pull ?
[0:09:52] <%hgtarras> hgtarras subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[0:09:54] <%hgtarras> hgtarras's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[0:09:55] <OToole42> Plagues like an obi wan type, but hermit obiwan, and instead of old sabers he just has pictures of butts drawn in his youth he rummages through
[0:10:01] <LordSDB> Thanks for the HahaLean @hgtarras
[0:10:07] <Puhff> Thanks for the HahaCat @hgtarras
[0:10:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> But what if we made a 40k game about a psyker
[0:10:19] <Puhff> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:10:35] <Puhff> :o
[0:10:41] <Triblade1992> Which one? Because there have been a lot of outsiders on Dathomir
[0:10:41] <Puhff> An Outsider you say?
[0:10:44] <%hgtarras> HahaPoint
[0:10:55] <@Nightbot> @Captainshoes -> No disassembly required. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:10:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its hard
[0:10:57] <+ConLin_Arts_> Plague, whens Dis from Darksiders Genesis art??
[0:11:02] <%hgtarras> Your welcome
[0:11:05] <+Splatterfest> Hi plague and chat hows it going
[0:11:10] <axivate_> No it's not...
[0:11:22] <Triblade1992> wittzLewd
[0:11:30] <Triblade1992> lewd
[0:11:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fury and Strife
[0:11:35] <axivate_> @PlagueOfGripes want me to make you some emotes?
[0:11:36] <Tiny_Axolotl> because drawing is hard
[0:11:36] <mortelkilll> do you want us to give you pictures?
[0:11:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Do it
[0:11:42] <pakanone12> Just draw some funny pics looooooooool 4Head
[0:11:43] <+Splatterfest> dbz character emotes
[0:11:44] <%hgtarras> I actually stopped watching pat, woolie and matt
[0:11:46] <OToole42> @PlagueOfGripes what sort of emotes would you want?
[0:11:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> ART
[0:11:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> pretty much
[0:12:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean you have the capacoty
[0:12:11] <Puhff> Alright then...
[0:12:15] <Puhff> lol
[0:12:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Be a ubermensch
[0:12:19] <Tiny_Axolotl> i miss the super best friends :(
[0:12:24] <Puhff> Well that was weird
[0:12:40] <Tiny_Axolotl> Pat alone is boring to watch
[0:12:45] <axivate_> @Tiny_Axolotl they're still around. the podcast was always the best bit tbh
[0:12:49] <Puhff> apatBig mood
[0:12:53] <+Demonstrandum> I think Pat and his sister are a fun combo
[0:12:55] <Puhff> LUL
[0:13:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Really want to know how she survive yhe droid massacre
[0:13:02] <Puhff> I love when he rubberbands back to you
[0:13:10] <+Captainshoes> calli brigs faces
[0:13:12] <Tiny_Axolotl> @axivate_ i do enjoy the woolie pat podcast
[0:13:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Speaking of droids. The CIS did nothing wrong
[0:13:21] <Triblade1992> "Not a dragonball channel"
[0:13:28] <Puhff> Oh the Magus set looks cool
[0:13:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> The CIS ship design is good
[0:13:38] <+Captainshoes> Just crop expressions from your art = good emote
[0:13:45] <OToole42> @PlagueOfGripes I can make you a blank white square for your 24.99 emote
[0:13:50] <+Splatterfest> dicks and asses for emotes
[0:13:53] <+Demonstrandum> I mean, that Avatar-face of yours would be a freebie
[0:14:01] <%hgtarras> @tiny_axolotl i do too. Pat has the most fans out of all of them. But i can’t take him by himself, woolie is boring to me and matt is best buds with liam who to me is a liar
[0:14:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Spartan Plague
[0:14:13] <Puhff> And in English
[0:14:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> Laconic Plague
[0:14:26] <baronvonbirman> Hello all, I wan't to die
[0:14:30] <axivate_> Imagine talking shit to a guy with a laser sword when you're using a literal knot of roots on a stick
[0:14:35] <+Captainshoes> Callie brigs smug expression emote Plague
[0:14:36] <Triblade1992> Maybe those three dragons you voice in the Dark souls parodies?
[0:14:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh nice crazy night brothers
[0:14:41] <Puhff> Could just make you chaneel icon an emote
[0:14:51] <Puhff> Or something from one of your animations
[0:14:59] <Puhff> channel*
[0:15:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nightbrothers without nightsisters to fuck. Thats a sad fate
[0:15:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Swing
[0:15:24] <axivate_> Plague your brand is smug furry butts from dragonball
[0:15:35] <Triblade1992> The three dragons from Dark Souls parody that you voice would make sense
[0:15:43] <Tiny_Axolotl> @hgtarras they truly are at their weakest individually aren't they? I find plague enjoyable though i wouldn't be here otherwise.
[0:15:49] <pakanone12> An emote that's a frame of Artorias going "That's racist!"
[0:15:53] <+torontototoro> howdy Plague. What Star Wars alien has the coolest design/would you want to draw?
[0:16:09] <+Gigmunch> What if you played league instead?
[0:16:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> All the humanoids are boring
[0:16:20] <%hgtarras> In darthomiran society the nightsisters are in control?
[0:16:22] <+victorvontzeentch> @PlagueOfGripes Force Pull and then Stab makes the Night Brothers a joke
[0:16:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Give me tgose crazy aliens
[0:16:33] <+Captainshoes> Plague why do twi'lek not wear leku socks? / stockings
[0:16:41] <baronvonbirman> You can always lean ito your "the hills have eyes" aesthetic if you need a gimmik to market
[0:16:44] <+torontototoro> twi'leks are pretty neat
[0:16:45] <Triblade1992> That's why the prequel aliens all come off as racial stereotypes
[0:16:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> I meam they were in control until dooku killed all ightsisters
[0:17:06] <+torontototoro> I love the quarians too
[0:17:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> nightsisters
[0:17:12] <Tiny_Axolotl> i like dooku, i don't like his name.
[0:17:14] <OToole42> leku's are like sensory organs, so it would be like wearing a sock on your tongue
[0:17:36] <dp4k> nothing better than smooth plague voice for my monday study session
[0:17:45] <stachystat> I think it tells you which room/area the chests are in
[0:17:49] <OToole42> He's a friggin skyrim greybeard
[0:17:55] <Triblade1992> Jedi. You are a jedi
[0:17:55] <seth45er> would it suck if you where one of these zabrak with the face marking like one of the insane clown posse
[0:18:01] <Puhff> This guy is cool but also lame
[0:18:04] <Cyral_Drive> is that a mothafucking dark souls reference
[0:18:09] <Tiny_Axolotl> he's going to teach us the dragn shout?
[0:18:11] <+torontototoro> they even cribbed the creepy DS laughs too
[0:18:13] <+Demonstrandum> I see they took the DS trend of characters having evil laughs
[0:18:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> Juggallos Zabraks
[0:18:26] <+Captainshoes> @OToole42 but what about Hera's hat that leads into Leku clothing?
[0:18:34] <Triblade1992> Well they are smarter
[0:18:48] <pakanone12> LUL
[0:18:53] <mortelkilll> why are they in underwear?
[0:19:10] <laserbeaming> How's it going Plague and Chat? Are we genociding natives now?
[0:19:13] <Triblade1992> WAT
[0:19:17] <Daxalog> Incredible
[0:19:18] <Triblade1992> That was jarring
[0:19:18] <OToole42> @Captainshoes maybe they're temperature sensative? Maybe some twileks are self concious? Who knows
[0:19:21] <Virokwet> =]
[0:19:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Well do they explain how there are still nightbrothers? After the sisters got BTFO?
[0:19:29] <Fluxraw> wow that was some low effor rock throw
[0:19:35] <+Demonstrandum> "He sees things before they happen"
[0:19:35] <pakanone12> cmonBruh
[0:19:36] <mortelkilll> we sonic now bois
[0:19:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is this another temple?
[0:19:48] <+Captainshoes> Yeah i'm just mentioning that it may be sensory but they wear minor accessories all the time on em unless it's more sensitive towards the tip.
[0:20:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Running arou d at speed of sound
[0:20:25] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[0:20:25] <+Captainshoes> @PlagueOfGripes
[0:20:29] <+Captainshoes> pop a heal while jumping
[0:20:33] <Triblade1992> This game has a number of polish problems
[0:20:34] <laserbeaming> that actually sounds like a bug
[0:20:35] <+Captainshoes> it adds a delay
[0:20:40] <theamazingroberto> @sonofthedeepsouth HEATHER
[0:20:44] <+Captainshoes> gives you more air time
[0:20:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> CINEMATIC
[0:20:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Great
[0:21:05] <mortelkilll> to be honest notcing a bunch of small issues is usually a sign that you dont enjoy the core of the game and constantly notice the flaws
[0:21:11] <+Captainshoes> Yeah you're gonna have to pop a heal mid jump
[0:21:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:21:29] <Triblade1992> "I know that reference" - Captain America
[0:21:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> I mean he is the plague of gripes
[0:21:45] <stachystat> complaining is plagues gimmick :p
[0:21:47] <laserbeaming> T-Pose to assert dominance over gravity
[0:21:54] <canisdyluna> i pop in and the first i see in the is jumping fucking op
[0:22:11] <+victorvontzeentch> Strange, the jumping seemed to work better on the Xbox
[0:22:12] <spacecatstreams> oh hey its plague
[0:22:37] <baker_doze> It's the Plague guy
[0:22:40] <MrqoQlobo> What is this, Tomb Raider with lightsabers?
[0:22:40] <Triblade1992> If it works better on the xbox, then it might be a Bayonetta situation where the Playstation version is the weaker one
[0:22:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Look I'm gonna say! Starkiller wasn't that bad of a character! There I've said it
[0:22:44] <theamazingroberto> does it brick the console? no? ship it.
[0:22:50] <baronvonbirman> sure
[0:22:53] <+Pomfles> delicious sacrificial animal
[0:22:53] <Daxalog> Itd go great in a stew. Not RAW
[0:22:55] <spacecatstreams> i wanna eat the egg from the mandalorian
[0:23:10] <pakanone12> UN FORASTERO
[0:23:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> the furry doesnt look great
[0:23:35] <stachystat> Does it?
[0:23:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> ALI ESTA
[0:23:37] <+victorvontzeentch> Force Pull
[0:23:39] <+victorvontzeentch> and stab
[0:23:39] <baker_doze> Spiders! PUNCH 'EM
[0:23:43] <theamazingroberto> in my head canon RE4 takes place in portugal
[0:23:48] <canisdyluna> shitholistan?
[0:23:51] <lennyrager> I think its spain
[0:23:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> Spain
[0:23:56] <Triblade1992> it senses your Jedi-ness
[0:24:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Saia daqui cabron
[0:24:06] <laserbeaming> It's probably an small island near spain
[0:24:22] <laserbeaming> Not many places in Europe where people speak spanish
[0:24:32] <theamazingroberto> there's literally two
[0:24:35] <laserbeaming> If it was South America it would be another issue entirely
[0:24:55] <+Splatterfest> Hes holding it in with the force
[0:24:59] <Daxalog> He runs like he wants to go into a full sprint. But isnt allowed too
[0:25:10] <+Pomfles> Nightsister looking kinda cute tho
[0:25:14] <canisdyluna> true true
[0:25:16] <laserbeaming> She's kinda dressed like Visas
[0:25:26] <stachystat> LUL
[0:25:31] <SuperVaderMan> Btw Force necromancy just exists now
[0:25:33] <laserbeaming> She's using Quan Chi Magic
[0:25:44] <+victorvontzeentch> @SuperVaderMan it has since the Clone Wars
[0:25:48] <+Pomfles> looks like something out of mortal kombat
[0:25:52] <+Splatterfest> the force can literally do anything
[0:25:52] <+BurkeBigsby> Gosh that red glow is kinda poop.
[0:25:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> I like that lightsabers used to be something really important for jedis and now they lose themselves all the time
[0:26:00] <Triblade1992> Scooby Doo on Zombie Island: This time, the MONSTERS ARE REAL
[0:26:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> ZOMBIES
[0:26:07] <lennyrager> Are we on Ratatak?
[0:26:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> It was siths you crazy woman
[0:26:18] <SuperVaderMan> @victorvontzeentch ye, and I wasn't a fan of it back then either LUL
[0:26:19] <+Demonstrandum> "You bring nothing but death" - a literaly necromancer
[0:26:21] <laserbeaming> Literal Undead
[0:26:26] <baker_doze> Until the sequel comes out and nope, they aren't real
[0:26:26] <mortelkilll> lets be honest, the monsters are real is kind of a huge plot twist for scooby doo
[0:26:26] <Mizaiya> Did plague have another sleep schedule change?
[0:26:33] <+ratchetex> yay more zombie mobs....
[0:26:35] <seth45er> there is alot of zombie stuff in star wars but the one best is Red harvest
[0:26:47] <+victorvontzeentch> @SuperVaderMan fair, its better than Rebels randomly deciding there is the Time Travel Dimension
[0:26:51] <pakanone12> Space Witches????
[0:26:52] <stachystat> what's Red Harvest about @seth45er ?
[0:26:56] <mortelkilll> real monsters should be used sparingly trough
[0:27:11] <theamazingroberto> the game wasn't dark souls before?
[0:27:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> of course
[0:27:30] <mortelkilll> i remember in one of the scooby doo episode there was that giant coral monster and at the end they find out that it was just a really pissed wild animal
[0:27:31] <theamazingroberto> LUL
[0:27:38] <+Captainshoes> nice catch
[0:27:40] <Triblade1992> WEEE!
[0:27:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Wait how did the droid has access to this information?
[0:27:55] <kvassimoto> LUL
[0:27:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> How TF would anyone know about that?
[0:27:57] <+BurkeBigsby> atpRtsd
[0:28:07] <stachystat> eh, game descriptions tend not to exactly match what happens in game
[0:28:08] <+BurkeBigsby> Free From platforming.
[0:28:09] <Triblade1992> LUL
[0:28:13] <Daxalog> There should be a secret up their
[0:28:19] <Daxalog> there*
[0:28:27] <mortelkilll> are those force zombies?
[0:28:28] <theamazingroberto> check their butts for keys
[0:28:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> eh
[0:28:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> he did it
[0:28:38] <mortelkilll> exept spiders
[0:28:43] <mortelkilll> spiders arent alive Kappa
[0:28:47] <seth45er> darth skeletor wants to live for ever trys to life hack a alchemist potion with a jedi plant
[0:28:49] <laserbeaming> It's such a weird thing for this guy from a technologically advanced civilization with FTL travel to use the word Undead
[0:28:51] <+Splatterfest> lmao
[0:29:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> except the apider
[0:29:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> The spiders are cool
[0:29:22] <laserbeaming> You are more alive than the other things, because the force. Maybe. Probably
[0:29:22] <mortelkilll> to be fair spiders are cold blooded
[0:29:23] <+Twistid_Tree> What were you saying that alot of people dont know?
[0:29:33] <professorno> They make ringwtaith sounds
[0:29:33] <baker_doze> The combat in Fallen Order: "If Sekiro Sucked." (By Skill Up)
[0:29:45] <mortelkilll> probably killed a few players
[0:29:53] <laserbeaming> But Sekiro Sucks! @baker_doze Kappa
[0:30:02] <baker_doze> @laserbeaming Aww.
[0:30:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh man Sekiro. I just wanted another tenchu game
[0:30:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> Rikimaru did nothing wrong
[0:30:24] <laserbeaming> I too would have preferred just another Tenchu game
[0:30:27] <mortelkilll> i liekd sekiro
[0:30:36] <+Splatterfest> those hips dont lie
[0:30:39] <DragonBornKing> sekiro was boring imo
[0:30:44] <+Pomfles> honestly Sekiro may be the best game of 2019
[0:30:58] <Tiny_Axolotl> no
[0:31:04] <Cyral_Drive> Sekiro is my number 2 behind RE2
[0:31:04] <LordSDB> Sekiero is cool but I'd rather have a Tenchu comeback
[0:31:06] <+captain_oceania7> sekiros combat is great
[0:31:08] <laserbeaming> In a year with Disco Elysium, DMC 5 and RE2?
[0:31:10] <+Pomfles> RE2 is 2018 friend
[0:31:14] <Triblade1992> Bloodborne is looking more and more good now that we haven't gotten a sequel to it for many years.
[0:31:14] <+Pomfles> wait nvm
[0:31:18] <+Pomfles> im a big dumb
[0:31:23] <laserbeaming> indeed
[0:31:35] <Daxalog> Its too lit
[0:31:36] <theamazingroberto> watching streams of this game and sekiro had the same effect: chilling my desire to buy it
[0:31:39] <+Pomfles> yeah RE2 then, for some reason I thought it was 2018
[0:31:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> She thinks the jedi were the ones that killed the sisters. I have no idea why?
[0:31:50] <zam47> Secret pervert?! It ain't no secret
[0:31:57] <mortelkilll> man these streams are 90% shitting on the jedis
[0:32:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> She should have been alive for the CIS massacre
[0:32:10] <SuperVaderMan> lookit that big cutie
[0:32:11] <mortelkilll> would be a cool thign if the jedi did kill them
[0:32:14] <stachystat> octoHello octoThere
[0:32:17] <zam47> Nightsister? Damn, some actually survived Grievous going balls deep into Dathomir
[0:32:20] <+BurkeBigsby> enemies don't seem to have to follow the same rules as you. Makes combat look weird.
[0:32:25] <baker_doze> @mortelkilll Would that make Plague...A Sith?
[0:32:29] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Jedi are boomers that dont know fun
[0:32:30] <Triblade1992> This franchise would have been on the right direction is if George Lucas produced the Thrawn Trilogy as a set of movies instead of making the prequels
[0:32:32] <zam47> Thought Asajj was the only one
[0:32:37] <mortelkilll> nah plague also hate the sith
[0:32:40] <Daxalog> Maybe hes new
[0:32:42] <mortelkilll> they are both dumbass
[0:32:59] <laserbeaming> A-Pose to keep balance
[0:33:13] <laserbeaming> KotOR kinda goes into it
[0:33:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> There is another universe where lucas made the Thrawn trilogy and it was good
[0:33:21] <laserbeaming> KotOR 2, specifically
[0:33:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> We will never know BibleThump
[0:33:29] <laserbeaming> but I guess it doesn't go deep enough
[0:33:33] <zam47> Mind trick to hot girl "You will sleep with me"
[0:33:34] <stachystat> Yeah give us the NPCs talking about what they're gonna have for dinner that'd be great for immersion Kappa
[0:33:36] <+BurkeBigsby> That's because any of the actual deep stuff is in the 123129 books that no normies don;t read.
[0:33:48] <pakanone12> Aaaaaaaaaaaaids
[0:33:52] <SuperVaderMan> and when they're not talking about light and dark side, they're talking about gray, as if everything in the force has to be on a slider of morality
[0:33:55] <+Splatterfest> dont you know you're a fucking idiot
[0:33:59] <laserbeaming> Darth Traya did nothing wrong. Except maybe for the attempted genocide part.
[0:34:14] <Triblade1992> @sonofthedeepsouth Lucasfilm could make the Thrawn Trilogy as a 3 season live action TV series reboot
[0:34:18] <+Splatterfest> X makes us go
[0:34:51] <theamazingroberto> it really is a lazy and downright insulting way of marking the ladder button. dark souls at least had them be nicely integrated switchplates and such in the floor
[0:34:59] <%Scarnehu> hey, how's space-wizard Souls going?
[0:35:03] <Ether101_Prime> Ah Dathomir, the lag planet.
[0:35:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Im still kinda pissed you can't follow traya disciplines and become an actual grey jedi
[0:36:08] <%Scarnehu> waiting politely
[0:36:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> @triblade1992 It would not be canon tho
[0:36:34] <Ether101_Prime> There's no such thing as Grey Jedi. The Dark Side's supposed to be a perversion of the Force.
[0:36:46] <laserbeaming> I loved to Flourish as an asshole in KotOR
[0:36:52] <%Scarnehu> flex on him while he waits
[0:37:00] <mortelkilll> we dont exactly hold george lucas canon in high standart prime
[0:37:06] <+eanscrale> What difficulty is this????
[0:37:06] <theamazingroberto> jolee bindo is totally a grey
[0:37:10] <+victorvontzeentch> The Dark Side being just a perversion of the Force was a dumb decision
[0:37:11] <Triblade1992> @sonofthedeepsouth They can make the changes to make it canon. Instead of Jacen and Jania, it's Ben who Leia is pregnant. Instead of a Clone of a Jedi, C'boath is associated with the Inquiusitors and makes references to it.
[0:37:13] <theamazingroberto> was* (spoiler alert)
[0:37:16] <nobknee> #JoleeBestGreyGrandpa
[0:37:23] <+victorvontzeentch> What the Night Sisters do, that should be a perversion of the Force
[0:37:33] <rosemon5001> roast those nuts
[0:37:38] <Wynzler> It's not really force stuff tho I thought
[0:37:40] <Wynzler> Just magic
[0:37:41] <%Scarnehu> toast those balls
[0:37:42] <mortelkilll> the jedi should also be a perversio nof the force
[0:37:47] <baker_doze> I don't know what is canon anymore. I don't know what to believe.
[0:37:56] <mortelkilll> the only canon is that luke is handsome
[0:37:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Savage Opress wanst a meme and was actually a fine character
[0:38:01] <laserbeaming> Well, It's really far away from Jolee's time by now. Of course he's ded
[0:38:12] <pakanone12> Being a Jedi is easy, just be born with a really strong aptitude to use the force
[0:38:18] <nobknee> Everything before Disney is canon. #DownWithTheMouse
[0:38:24] <+BurkeBigsby> iT IS LIKE dARK sOULS! iT Harrd!
[0:38:24] <+victorvontzeentch> @Wynzler I think its Magic that is powere by the Force
[0:38:34] <Triblade1992> defintelly
[0:38:44] <$SilverRoddo> Force Clip.
[0:38:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Dont say that the mouse will send his deathsquads
[0:38:47] <TardigradeRex> Oh, you mean Sekiro? LUL
[0:38:53] <+victorvontzeentch> I played it on the second hardest difficulty, it was a bitch
[0:38:58] <laserbeaming> Generous Parry Windows are necessary in this kind of game
[0:39:07] <Kiraklene> USELESS I SAY
[0:39:08] <theamazingroberto> a few of the streamers i follow played on that "super bonus extra demo double fuck hard" difficulty level and it looked even less fun than this (which is saying something)
[0:39:22] <Ether101_Prime> I wish this game had more polish.
[0:39:33] <TardigradeRex> The biggest problem with Sekiro is the lackluster replayability.
[0:39:40] <%Scarnehu> that's what happens when your game has 0 replay value
[0:39:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> BTW The Mouse deathsquads may become a thing on how big their monopoly is getting
[0:39:55] <LordSDB> Sekiro also has the least replay ability that doesn't help it
[0:39:56] <Wynzler> Wait what's wrong with FromSoft?
[0:40:00] <Daxalog> Nah. If Sekiro had more customization those same people wouldve been more fore it.
[0:40:01] <laserbeaming> My main problem with Sekiro is the control scheme and UI
[0:40:11] <Tiny_Axolotl> Sekiro lore is also meh
[0:40:13] <TardigradeRex> I dont really think DS3 was that bad, I rather enjoyed it.
[0:40:14] <+BurkeBigsby> Didn't get roped in by the story, the same way context unfolds like dark souls and lack of gameplay variation.
[0:40:21] <+azure22900> Sekiro the game should have been a weapon type.
[0:40:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Play Brutal doom for the edge mmes plague
[0:40:36] <+eanscrale> Having just the katana also really hammers how simple the combat is.
[0:40:41] <$SilverRoddo> This looks Havok-y engine-y.
[0:40:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh better yet play Hdoom and critique the art
[0:40:45] <+victorvontzeentch> @PlagueOfGripes with the Second Blade out if you perfect parry one shot, when 3 are coming it perfect parries all of them
[0:40:56] <laserbeaming> I don't think this uses Havok?
[0:41:02] <laserbeaming> Does EA even use it?
[0:41:04] <nobknee> 'Member Kyle Katarn and how cool his beard is? So cool that he shot lightning as a Jedi? I 'member.
[0:41:08] <+BurkeBigsby> He's James Cameron of games.
[0:41:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Laser Bows?
[0:41:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHAT THE HELL
[0:41:36] <LordSDB> I hope Armor Core comes back but FromSoft been out of mecha for a bit now
[0:41:42] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:41:43] <theamazingroberto> "vaguely" similar
[0:41:53] <baker_doze> I was compelled enough to complete the first Dark Souls, couldn't muster the will to complete DS2 because of PVP/Co-op achievements despite getting used to its weirdness, and felt DS3 was only fine enough for one playthrough and that's it.
[0:41:58] <DragonBornKing> i want more kings field and shadow tower
[0:42:03] <Triblade1992> Dark Souls was refining out the Demon souls. Bloodborne is a good entrance point though.
[0:42:06] <+eanscrale> I look forward to Miyazaki's equivalent to Death Stranding
[0:42:09] <+ratchetex> I think he has potential, but maybe like Lukas he needs to be rained in
[0:42:22] <baker_doze> @DragonBornKing Yes! Definitely
[0:42:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> I actually liked Bloodborne
[0:42:25] <+SoleilAstier> What game are we talking about?
[0:42:39] <Triblade1992> same here son
[0:42:39] <+TQuick101> many many people liked bloodborne
[0:42:45] <theamazingroberto> i'm holding onto hope for chaos wolf 2
[0:42:48] <+ratchetex> I like bloodborn too
[0:42:59] <bear_breaker20> tbh i felt sekiro reached that level, but after iteration after iteration losing scope seems likely
[0:43:01] <+eanscrale> Games are a collaboration.
[0:43:08] <nobknee> Bloodborne good, lotta eyeballs.
[0:43:17] <laserbeaming> We can't even take a guess at Elden Ring's gameplay. I hope it's not like Sekiro
[0:43:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> AND BLUD
[0:43:19] <+BurkeBigsby> I Hope the story format changes. Sick of reading items and scrounging to find people to exhaust dialoogue.
[0:43:35] <stachystat> Elven ring is the one with George writing on it right?
[0:43:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> The GRRM game? It will have incest. Im sure of it
[0:43:36] <LordSDB> I tried to get into bloodborne but I just couldn't. It's a good game still
[0:43:43] <%Scarnehu> fromsoft games; do they do things? what do they do? let's find out
[0:43:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Incest created the ring
[0:43:55] <laserbeaming> More incest than you'd think, but less than you'd hope
[0:43:57] <DragonBornKing> @baker_doze check out monomyth on steam its not out yet but its inspired kings field and arx fatalis
[0:44:02] <Ether101_Prime> The style switch ability really good.
[0:44:19] <mortelkilll> is it wrogn that he want to make action games?
[0:44:25] <theamazingroberto> the "elven ring" mentioned in the title is just your player character's sister's asshole
[0:44:26] <+eanscrale> yeah, the fact that the geographic aspect of DS1 never happened in the sequels still turned me off.
[0:44:31] <Triblade1992> Bloodborne was parallel to Dark Souls if anything, It was just easier for people to get in
[0:44:32] <DragonBornKing> i would love for fromsoft games to slow down again
[0:44:37] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:44:55] <%Scarnehu> @stachystat i believe it's Elden ring, but yeah
[0:45:05] <bear_breaker20> geography downgrades were the biggest let downs over timeyuh
[0:45:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> So Elven ring is just the community of hillbillies FAE
[0:45:11] <baker_doze> I'd kinda be interested in a King's Field/Shadow Tower Remake or Sequel in VR, to see if it could be done well by From Software
[0:45:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Kkonna
[0:45:16] <pakanone12> How often does he read the chat?
[0:45:24] <TardigradeRex> There is this problem with keeping the gameplay somewhat the same with each iteration and still keeping the challenge for "veteran" players. If you want to keep the challenge for veteran players you either have to make timings incredibly narrow(which would make it absurdly hard for new players) or you change the gameplay up for somehting new, that way both veteran and new players will be able to have a fair challenge.
[0:45:24] <theamazingroberto> almost never
[0:45:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sometimes
[0:45:35] <stachystat> @Scarnehu thanks, wasn't quite sure
[0:45:41] <theamazingroberto> idk why he even has it on screen
[0:45:50] <+TQuick101> because he does read it
[0:45:59] <+ratchetex> yeah every after one being like "fuck it you can teleport from the start why not?"
[0:46:03] <theamazingroberto> reverse psychology works you guys!
[0:46:08] <nobknee> Elven Ring: The Middle-Earth Adventures.
[0:46:08] <TardigradeRex> elden = "the fire" in sweden
[0:46:10] <TardigradeRex> Swedish
[0:46:11] <Ether101_Prime> I find that some of the powered up shots can be blocked.
[0:46:18] <bear_breaker20> my elden stain on the carpet
[0:46:18] <nobknee> Happy for you. :)
[0:46:18] <laserbeaming> She's literally Quan Chi
[0:46:23] <+rareqq> no that's MY girlfriend
[0:46:28] <+BurkeBigsby> How dare you betray Nozomi.
[0:46:29] <%Scarnehu> fuckin' Space weeb
[0:46:41] <TardigradeRex> Also "Lapp"(as in DS3 patches) is also "Patch" in Swedish.
[0:46:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Quan Chi
[0:46:50] <$pennykettle_> The people who use the word Elden are the people who don't want to get sued by Bethesda for using the word Elder
[0:46:50] <mortelkilll> honestly 2 kind of does the build variety the best
[0:47:01] <+rareqq> yeah the platforming is iffy
[0:47:05] <nobknee> You can play ranged well in the Dark Force/Jedi Knight games. Good games, real SW.
[0:47:09] <mortelkilll> i mostly go into myazaki games for level design
[0:47:14] <PeramFare> Personally I enjoyed sekiro more than dark souls or bloodborne. Found it way easier than bloodborne too.
[0:47:16] <mortelkilll> and i was satisfied wit hthat in sekiro
[0:47:26] <+rareqq> they should really just make a new jedi knight game
[0:47:30] <+SoleilAstier> Maybe make the lightsaber parts actually do something
[0:47:42] <%Scarnehu> still the best star wars game we've had in nearly 10 years
[0:47:45] <+rareqq> (they don't)
[0:47:46] <mortelkilll> myazaki not being the exact person you wanted hi mto be does not necessarly mean hes bad at his job
[0:47:47] <+victorvontzeentch> @PlagueOfGripes with the Second Blade out if you perfect parry one shot, when 3 are coming it perfect parries all of them
[0:48:15] <mortelkilll> just that the games he lieks to make may not align with his fans as much as they first tought
[0:48:22] <Daxalog> The second blade is for crowd control right?
[0:48:27] <Unicyclemonkey> NICE
[0:48:32] <baker_doze> @DragonBornKing Thank you for the Monomyth recommendation, had no idea about it until now
[0:48:39] <laserbeaming> Tis a flesh wound
[0:48:47] <%Scarnehu> that'll demoralize him
[0:48:48] <$SilverRoddo> I heard there are Bruce Lee Light Nunchuckus.
[0:48:48] <+eanscrale> He has graze mechanics
[0:48:53] <+BurkeBigsby> Nothig more fun that dodging for an eternity then hitting once....
[0:48:56] <stachystat> Would you have preferred it more Sekiro style with different swordplay techniques for the lightsaber?
[0:49:03] <Ether101_Prime> I like that it marks the things you can now effect with your abilities. Don't know why treasure chest and the like don't get marked.
[0:49:04] <LordSDB> Counts on the boss
[0:49:06] <+rareqq> in mortal kombat when you play Jason Voorhees
[0:49:09] <+victorvontzeentch> @Daxalog mostly, but its good on big enemies for losts of attack. the perfect parrying lots of shots
[0:49:13] <AMadHollow> hyper armor is fun for you.
[0:49:16] <AJusticeLemon> only when they give it to you
[0:49:17] <%Scarnehu> when you're the one using it. otherwise no
[0:49:19] <+eanscrale> Fighting games when you're the guy with the hyper armor.
[0:49:20] <eccentricprinceofroses> Street Fighter
[0:49:20] <Tiny_Axolotl> only when we have it
[0:49:26] <laserbeaming> Hyper Armor works in fighting games. But you have grabs to counter them, usually
[0:49:27] <TardigradeRex> Castlevania 1 and just about every other NES game? :D
[0:49:27] <LordSDB> It can either hype up a fight or make it feel boring
[0:49:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> The lightsaber as a bat always bothered me
[0:49:30] <+PerrinIsDead> Hey Plague
[0:49:34] <SuperVaderMan> I don't think it's ever fun to hit an enemy and they just ignore it
[0:49:44] <DragonBornKing> @baker_doze im always looking for anything like kings field/shadow tower but sadly there is very few games like them
[0:49:47] <+BurkeBigsby> Kintaro, Goro
[0:49:47] <+rareqq> Kintaro is the tiger Goro
[0:49:47] <laserbeaming> Motaro is the Centaur dude
[0:49:49] <mortelkilll> hyper armor is usually abotu balance rather than fun
[0:49:49] <SwagetronPrime> Motaro is teh centaur from MK3
[0:49:52] <+SoleilAstier> For the player, it can be fun to benefit from hyper armor but when a boss has it no
[0:49:55] <laserbeaming> Kintaro*
[0:50:00] <mortelkilll> its so you cant infinite big ennemies
[0:50:14] <SwagetronPrime> Kintaro is MK2 4arms guy, Goro is MK1
[0:50:16] <%Scarnehu> Farm into fighting games with Eli Gripes
[0:50:35] <laserbeaming> fuck those names, too similar
[0:50:35] <+rareqq> no, it's just a bit damp
[0:50:37] <Daxalog> It also makes enemies seem imposing or jjust plain tough
[0:50:37] <+PerrinIsDead> So Jack Packard kinda ripped this game a new one, was he too harsh?
[0:50:44] <+rareqq> landlord said if you get a dehumidifier it's a steal
[0:50:46] <$SilverRoddo> Shiva makes short work of one of them if you spam her stomp attack.
[0:50:53] <%Scarnehu> that's a sturdy ass crate
[0:51:01] <SwagetronPrime> Motaro was a special little pony boy since he reflected all projectiles.
[0:51:07] <nobknee> Stupid shit can't jump good.
[0:51:09] <AMadHollow> why not just force jump? jesus this game is lame
[0:51:13] <Teyaric> I kind of like that Cal's whole deal is that he's functionally CRIPPLED in the force.
[0:51:14] <Ether101_Prime> Dathomir's was a planet ruled by a cult of Dark Side witches so yeah, its safe to say its not a good place to be.
[0:51:14] <mortelkilll> fighting game bosses are almost alway bullshit
[0:51:18] <Zebroneath> Or the rot of decades of moisture the wood would undergo.
[0:51:26] <laserbeaming> is Shiva playable in MKX?
[0:51:32] <+PerrinIsDead> This game have any EU stuff?
[0:51:48] <Ether101_Prime> Dathomir is an EU thing.
[0:51:54] <+rareqq> this game is all EU stuff
[0:51:56] <+CatastropheCorvid> "Turdling Mc-GingerFuck"
[0:52:02] <%Scarnehu> Darth Gingerfuck
[0:52:05] <+BurkeBigsby> More like an apprentice.
[0:52:05] <TardigradeRex> Should have casted "The Rock" for this little padawan I guess :D
[0:52:06] <Triblade1992> So Kanen in a nutshell?
[0:52:09] <+victorvontzeentch> @PerrinIsDead its all the new EU
[0:52:11] <AMadHollow> @ether101_prime nah its in both rebels and clones.
[0:52:17] <Teyaric> He's literally crippled in the plot - he's got traumatic barriers keeping him from remembering PUSH for the first few hours. C'mon.
[0:52:33] <Ether101_Prime> @AMadHollow It was in the EU first.
[0:52:37] <%Scarnehu> born 2 die
[0:52:38] <+PerrinIsDead> @ether101_prime Nice! Tell me more about Dark Side witches good sir
[0:52:42] <mortelkilll> for a jedi we are really weak
[0:52:49] <sonofthedeepsouth> Have you ever take notice on how many times incest appeared as a subject in ancient myths from different civilizations. I think its funny how fetishes kept consistency even through great distances and ages.
[0:52:56] <+victorvontzeentch> @PlagueOfGripes seriously, Force Pull and then Stab when they get to you
[0:53:02] <AMadHollow> @ether101_prime yes, but you said "its the eu" its not. its canon.
[0:53:02] <nobknee> Galen Marek is a good boy.
[0:53:05] <Triblade1992> Not with how Lucas established where 7-8 clone troopers can kill a Master
[0:53:09] <baker_doze> @DragonBornKing Apparently, two games on Itch.io called "Unkingly: Survival Mode" and "Myth Bearer" are inspired somewhat by King's Field, but the perspective is Overhead with 8-bit visuals instead of 1st Person
[0:53:12] <Zebroneath> Quote the Clone Wars cartoon where Mace Windo just blasts an entire army of droids away.
[0:53:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Galen Marek was great
[0:53:16] <laserbeaming> He still has the Force Stasis thing. I don't know if that is supposed to be super advanced though
[0:53:28] <TardigradeRex> I think the force unleashed was really just one big fever dream for Star Wars enthusiasts.
[0:53:29] <laserbeaming> I can't imagine it being a basic power
[0:53:35] <+PerrinIsDead> @victorvontzeentch Good! That’s always my favorite SW shit because the main plot of the big movies is always BLOW DEATH STAR UP
[0:53:46] <+PerrinIsDead> Small contained stories in the universe are always more interesting
[0:53:51] <+BurkeBigsby> CAn't block it, yet wood walls do.
[0:53:53] <TardigradeRex> This jump :D
[0:54:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> How they justify the lightsaber not being able to cut wood
[0:54:07] <Triblade1992> wow
[0:54:09] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh yeah magic trees and shit
[0:54:11] <Ether101_Prime> @AMadHollow no I didn't say that. I was saying that this is form EU which it is. It was brought into the canon because that's what Lucas was doing in The Clone Wars and Underground.
[0:54:12] <mortelkilll> its force wood
[0:54:14] <+PerrinIsDead> When are we gonna get Kyle Kitarn back? Like he should be in the new movies or get his own
[0:54:18] <TardigradeRex> I've seen reviewers curse this jump :D
[0:54:19] <Zebroneath> WOW
[0:54:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE FORCE PROTECTS THE FUCKING WOOD
[0:54:21] <Triblade1992> WOW
[0:54:24] <laserbeaming> Not at all
[0:54:26] <+azure22900> wtf was that
[0:54:30] <theamazingroberto> cortosis doesn't grow on trees you know or maybe it does?
[0:54:54] <+SoleilAstier> Frostbyte
[0:54:55] <+rareqq> frostbyte
[0:54:55] <Triblade1992> Frostbite
[0:54:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:54:56] <Zebroneath> Frostbite
[0:54:56] <Unicyclemonkey> Frostbite
[0:54:58] <DragonBornKing> ignite?
[0:55:03] <DragonBornKing> o
[0:55:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Frosbute
[0:55:20] <DragonBornKing> i think the ignite engine is only for sports games
[0:55:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Frostbutt?
[0:55:22] <TardigradeRex> Frostbutt
[0:55:33] <TardigradeRex> @sonofthedeepsouth Hah
[0:55:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> hey
[0:55:42] <theamazingroberto> ea slimed their way around dice to get the frostbite engine
[0:55:44] <nobknee> Remember when Disney said the EU doesn't count anymore, but now they claim there's not alot of source material to pull from? Clap clap.
[0:56:05] <+BurkeBigsby> Needs more Havok....
[0:56:09] <laserbeaming> Huh, they are not using Frostbite?
[0:56:10] <+CatastropheCorvid> Not yet
[0:56:12] <Triblade1992> @nobknee Well 95% of it isn't all that good. Thrawn Trilogy, KOTOT and KOTOR 2 are rare exceptions
[0:56:20] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveFreeze You’re not going to send Frostbite to the cooler!
[0:56:21] <AMadHollow> @nobknee nah, that was just the shit head who ruined it.
[0:56:25] <+PerrinIsDead> @nobknee Can we just make the Disney shit non-cannon and rebuild all the cool shit? Just give me a damn KOTOR tv show
[0:56:30] <sonofthedeepsouth> @nobknee Its almost like they thought it was going to be easy to mantain an universe and shit
[0:56:40] <nobknee> @Triblade1992 I'll take all the goofy shit in the EU over anything they did with it.
[0:56:47] <laserbeaming> huh, it's using Unreal?
[0:56:52] <%Scarnehu> now THIS is podracing

[0:56:56] <+CatastropheCorvid> That's a bug.
[0:57:01] <AMadHollow> @triblade1992 while those are pinnacles, theres a ton of good shit in the eu, you just have to sift through the trashfire
[0:57:06] <mortelkilll> doesnt help that the new movies dont introduce anything good
[0:57:07] <+PerrinIsDead> Anyone read those RA Salvatore Star Wars books?
[0:57:18] <nobknee> @PerrinIsDead I just ignore anything Disney did, and count everything before. SW is dead, and I will enjoy what was made before it died.
[0:57:20] <mortelkilll> does anyoen want to make stories with the first order?
[0:57:20] <laserbeaming> wikipedia says the engine is UE4 monkaS
[0:57:24] <mortelkilll> or snoke?
[0:57:28] <Triblade1992> @nobknee no me. because the Vong, One Sith, Abeloth and Sun Crusher basically messed HARD. It makes the First Order look like a playground scirmish by comparison
[0:57:29] <+CatastropheCorvid> Have you encountered the bug where BD will not interact with something until you relaunch the game?
[0:57:30] <Teyaric> On a scale of 1 to Souls, how is this?
[0:57:40] <+PerrinIsDead> @nobknee That’s fair RIP Star Wars
[0:58:01] <Wynzler> I almost think they made the game as sloppily as possible
[0:58:03] <ZE_Count> ohh thats a cool map
[0:58:04] <+SoleilAstier> Those EU books may be hit or miss but anything is better than killing the big baddie in TLJ then having to pull the emperor out of JJ's ass and kill everything Luke did.
[0:58:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> The last Jedi wasn't a good movie. But that one moment where they could try to make something new. They just wave it away
[0:58:11] <Triblade1992> Remember when the Vong killed 365 BILLION people?
[0:58:12] <%JJCheeker> Is this the Darth maul planet
[0:58:16] <AMadHollow> @nobknee have you seen the mandolorian though? shits great
[0:58:25] <SuperVaderMan> oh no a shitty wooden gate, if only we had some kind of tool that could cut through anything
[0:58:26] <%Scarnehu> man, the new movie comes out in 2 weeks and i haven't heard ANYONE talking about it
[0:58:30] <+CatastropheCorvid> @JJCheeker Yes.
[0:58:33] <nobknee> @Triblade1992 I love all that shit. The Vong are neat. But I force nobody to join me in this grave.
[0:58:41] <+BurkeBigsby> No. Dodge spasm attack, then attack once before it goes ape shit again.
[0:58:43] <mortelkilll> thats because no oen give a shit about the star wars movies anymore
[0:58:48] <Teyaric> SLOW WORKS ON THOSE
[0:58:50] <AMadHollow> PLAGUE, JEDI DONT USE BLASTERS
[0:58:51] <mortelkilll> we already knwo its gonan be garbage
[0:58:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> I hope it flops I want the mouse to break its stupid nose
[0:59:02] <SuperVaderMan> death throe attack LUL
[0:59:04] <Triblade1992> @nobknee I hated how the Vong were practically immune to the Force because they came from outside the Galaxy. that's midichlorian levels of bad
[0:59:09] <Wynzler> It's supposed to do that lol
[0:59:10] <Virokwet> he does that
[0:59:11] <+rareqq> it has a death animation
[0:59:18] <$pennykettle_> I like how dark souls has so many consumables that never get used. alluring skulls, resistance munchies
[0:59:23] <$SilverRoddo> I wish it did a Spin-dash.
[0:59:24] <SuperVaderMan> GOOD
[0:59:27] <LordSDB> creep walk
[0:59:30] <+SoleilAstier> i want the movie to flop as well at this point
[0:59:35] <Ether101_Prime> Jedi aren't supposed to be all powerful either.
[0:59:35] <Wynzler> lmao this game is one hell of a buggy mess
[0:59:40] <Teyaric> Swamp-Sink
[0:59:49] <SuperVaderMan> It's like when you're going down a pretend set of stairs
[0:59:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> I meam 365 billions of lifes lost in a galaxy as big as star wars is nothing really
[0:59:57] <+CatastropheCorvid> @Wynzler Yeah, but it's still no Fallout.
[1:00:00] <$SilverRoddo> What WWE2K20?
[1:00:13] <+PerrinIsDead> So the main reason this new trilogy is disappointing is literally not having the same directors and writers for each movie. When you turn it into a god damn focus group no one is going to have a clear vision for the story arc. Rian Jonson basically ignored 7 and now 9 has to work to ignore 8
[1:00:20] <+SoleilAstier> DS2 levels of ambush
[1:00:21] <nobknee> @Triblade1992 I like that it explored more Force stuff. What it is, what it isn't. And the Force still empowered Jacen to become God and say "no u" to the Vong at the end. Works for me.
[1:00:22] <%JJCheeker> This game is a bunch of elements from other games that do it better
[1:00:46] <bear_breaker20> kinda like GoW
[1:00:48] <SuperVaderMan> are there any good enemies in this game, or are they all dedicated to making you hate the combat
[1:00:48] <nobknee> P O N C H O
[1:00:52] <Ether101_Prime> Having Sith that can eat entire planets or destroy entire star fleets on a whim makes most of the stuff happening in the story kind of pointless.
[1:00:53] <%JJCheeker> I like the pink robot
[1:00:59] <TardigradeRex> Chests, is this.... ZELDA!?!
[1:01:10] <Triblade1992> @PerrinIsDead Nah, different directors aren't the problem. The OT functioned on different directors. The movies should share the same writers though
[1:01:13] <+CatastropheCorvid> You can switch to not using the poncho, also.
[1:01:14] <nobknee> Darth Nihilus is the best, and that is as true as gravity.
[1:01:14] <Ether101_Prime> You can take off the pancho.
[1:01:26] <%JJCheeker> He needs a helmet
[1:01:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> Noone is ever really gone. Except Porkins, Porkins is gone forever
[1:01:36] <%JJCheeker> So we don't have to look at his ugly face
[1:01:43] <%Scarnehu> sounds like me when i found out my wife was pregnant
[1:01:44] <Ether101_Prime> Look at that Jedi Star Fighter.
[1:01:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fucking skeletal palpatine in the death star that exploded is still alive
[1:01:56] <+SoleilAstier> @PerrinIsDead you could have had different writers with ideas if you had a narrative through-line. Like We need to get from A to B but how we get there could be done by different writers. Also for TLJ maybe more than one draft and some peer reviews would have been great
[1:01:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> I hate it
[1:01:59] <+PerrinIsDead> @triblade1992 Yeah just people with a consistent vision for the story would help massively
[1:02:11] <$pennykettle_> how much does an incredibley basic story and characters diminish this type of gameplay? it seems like ginger mcbabyface saying "wow tough one bd" after you do anything makes it feel chrap
[1:02:26] <mortelkilll> the characters are really bad
[1:02:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> what
[1:02:37] <+PerrinIsDead> @soleilastier Yeah that’s more what I meant!
[1:02:39] <Ether101_Prime> They needed people that actually liked Star Wars.
[1:02:53] <%Scarnehu> what's that smell? THE FORCE
[1:02:55] <nobknee> 'Member 1313? I 'member.
[1:02:58] <mortelkilll> lets be honest, do we like star wars?
[1:03:02] <TardigradeRex> When you put all your points in STR and none in DEX.
[1:03:07] <Triblade1992> @PerrinIsDead like if I was making a Thrawn Trilogy in the 90's. I would have Steven Speilburg, Irvin Kershner and James Cameron be the directors for each movie. However, all three movies would have Timothy Zahn and Lawrence Kasdan as the duo of writers
[1:03:14] <+SoleilAstier> @mortelkilll some times we do lol
[1:03:14] <+Demonstrandum> Oh look, it's those fun no-startup hits everyone loved from DS2
[1:03:18] <mortelkilll> i feel that we like the idea of star wars but nto really star wars itself
[1:03:20] <nobknee> @mortelkilll I love STARWARS. I'm sad it's dead. But better than a Mouse eatin' it alive.
[1:03:24] <Teyaric> That sounds like a badass berserker you're describing there, @PlagueOfGripes
[1:03:45] <+CatastropheCorvid> TRhey exploded.
[1:03:45] <$pennykettle_> ds2 had big dumb ogrea
[1:03:52] <+PerrinIsDead> @triblade1992 It’s like what is Disney’s vision for the series? Just to keep pumping shit out?
[1:03:53] <+CatastropheCorvid> IIRC
[1:03:55] <mortelkilll> i feel thats most ds2 ennemies
[1:03:55] <%Scarnehu> flame demon?
[1:03:56] <AMadHollow> exploding hollows and acid bugs
[1:03:58] <TardigradeRex> I like the enemies that don't want to attack me when I hit them. LUL
[1:04:01] <nobknee> Remember when Woolie wanted to fuck Mission? That's my STARWARS.
[1:04:02] <DragonBornKing> kotor 1&2 was the best thing to come out of star wars
[1:04:18] <Skeletonmanners> hey Plague hope product is treating you well
[1:04:23] <+CatastropheCorvid> Man, I can't wait for all the Merrin ... Art.
[1:04:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> But what will the mouse latch onto now that star wars movie gonna be put in the fridge? Please don't be 40k
[1:04:32] <+PerrinIsDead> @nobknee KOTOR still the best LP
[1:04:40] <nobknee> HAH. Disney 40K.
[1:04:40] <DragonBornKing> @nobknee who doesnt want some fine ass twi'lek jailbait
[1:04:40] <+Demonstrandum> There was the heide knights who had an instant swipe
[1:04:44] <Zebroneath> I think it was in the dark caves in Brightstone Cove, something with lanky arms that stayed in the dark.
[1:04:46] <Triblade1992> @PerrinIsDead eh, TV shows. Also a KOTOR trilogy is probably the direction they will go. As long as Drew Karpyshyn and Cassey Hudson are on board, I'm game
[1:04:54] <TechGFennec> Hello
[1:04:57] <nobknee> Woolie "14 is adult in Twi'lek" Madden.
[1:04:58] <+onlypuppet> The crawling people with the fleshy sacks in their backs?
[1:05:03] <AMadHollow> I'm out, I'm glad you love everything about the game and its combat. especially padowan rancors
[1:05:22] <DragonBornKing> i dont want current bioware anywhere near kotor 3
[1:05:25] <+Demonstrandum> Weren't you glad when they added WAY more of them in Scholar of the first sin ?
[1:05:26] <$pennykettle_> brightstone tseldora was the spider place. you're thinking of no man's wharf @zebroneath
[1:05:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Rancors are cool no doubt about it
[1:05:38] <AMadHollow> @nobknee muka shaka paka
[1:05:40] <+SoleilAstier> Dinsey would never touch 40K those fans would burn down the studios
[1:05:42] <DragonBornKing> give kotor 3 to larian maybe
[1:05:43] <+PerrinIsDead> @triblade1992 I think a TV show would be great for KOTOR! There’s so much to explore and I don’t think movies can do that very well without becoming BLOW THE DEATHSTAR UP
[1:05:46] <%JJCheeker> There is gonna be no kotor 3
[1:05:51] <Triblade1992> @DragonBornKing I was talking about taking KOTOR 1 and making it into a trilogy of movies
[1:05:53] <mortelkilll> shields are annoying at first but you can learn to deal with them reliably
[1:06:00] <Wynzler> Ahh, yes
[1:06:02] <%Scarnehu> XD
[1:06:04] <Skeletonmanners> safety dance
[1:06:06] <nobknee> I used to want KOTOR 3 and Jade Empire 2 and Mass Effect sequels. Now, I'm glad two out of three didn't happen properly or at all. Fuckin' MMO piece of shit.
[1:06:06] <bear_breaker20> staying alive
[1:06:07] <Wynzler> Here we see the rare Dathomir Mating Dance
[1:06:07] <mortelkilll> the ennemeis in this game just look tedious
[1:06:07] <+Risingxiv> Is he flossing?
[1:06:08] <Ether101_Prime> At lest they aren't Wind Waker Darknughts where the main mechanic for them doesn't work right.
[1:06:09] <SuperVaderMan> This looks great
[1:06:12] <$pennykettle_> she likes fortnite
[1:06:15] <%JJCheeker> You got that T pose
[1:06:17] <+SoleilAstier> Hahaha
[1:06:17] <DragonBornKing> @Triblade1992 that wold be cool so disney would never do it
[1:06:20] <Triblade1992> @PerrinIsDead That was only episode 7 though. If anything, it was the OT that did 2 death stars
[1:06:24] <BinaryBetrayer> A pose shuffle
[1:06:24] <Teyaric> Do The Electric Sliii~iiide
[1:06:26] <Zebroneath> what a miserable existence
[1:06:28] <TechGFennec> More like an A pose JJ
[1:06:31] <Saterion> Building up speed for 12 hours
[1:06:32] <AMadHollow> @dragonbornking give it to obsidian.
[1:06:41] <%JJCheeker> True
[1:06:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> half button press
[1:06:48] <%JJCheeker> It did look like an A
[1:06:59] <Teyaric> Part of the corpse model placement. Standard ragdoll positrioning
[1:07:00] <DragonBornKing> @AMadHollow i honestly dont like new obsidian much either but they are still better than new bioware
[1:07:07] <TechGFennec> Are the limbs floating or am I mistaken?
[1:07:12] <+CatastropheCorvid> It is
[1:07:13] <+PerrinIsDead> @triblade1992 Fair, guess I’m just speaking on big movie plots in general where EVERYTHING is always at stake and the background info on the universe isn’t focused on
[1:07:17] <TechGFennec> Huh
[1:07:26] <+FadingEmber> Moment like this make me miss the force power in Unleashed
[1:07:28] <+SoleilAstier> Obsidian would do well with the universe but EA got those rights. Got all that money
[1:07:31] <+Cucamabungabu> Eli are you going to do a league botgame with your viewers some day again?
[1:07:31] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its floating
[1:07:31] <TechGFennec> I guess it is AAA game
[1:07:36] <AMadHollow> @dragonbornking I mean, they are mostly the old obsidian and old bioware together.
[1:07:40] <Seatherten> good evening
[1:07:41] <nobknee> 'Member Kreia, and how she presented real questions about the Force? I 'member.
[1:07:55] <TechGFennec> It ain't AAA until the boundaries are set up wrong
[1:08:08] <$pennykettle_> the new Warframe devstream was very depressing
[1:08:11] <$SilverRoddo> Be wary of RPGEmpty
[1:08:25] <laserbeaming> Call of Lotus: Modern Warframe
[1:08:42] <AMadHollow> dynasty warframe
[1:08:44] <Seatherten> no more ninja at all
[1:08:46] <$pennykettle_> Warframe doesn't k ow what it wants to be
[1:08:46] <nobknee> I wish Stalker in Warframe was scary again.
[1:08:56] <Seatherten> it's just damage wiping the room the fastest
[1:08:56] <sonofthedeepsouth> Do not pursue Lu Bu
[1:09:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> Is Warframe lore actually good?
[1:09:21] <mortelkilll> kinda
[1:09:26] <Seatherten> no
[1:09:27] <BinaryBetrayer> It's a mixed bag of mostly good.
[1:09:27] <laserbeaming> @nobknee kinda hard to make something scary with so many Warframes are pretty much immortal
[1:09:29] <mortelkilll> but the game wait for the last few hours to give it to you
[1:09:33] <AMadHollow> @nobknee he just needs the treatment that they gave the liches. in calling it now. that will happen in the new war
[1:09:34] <laserbeaming> when* not with
[1:09:37] <TechGFennec> The lore is good but very derivative
[1:09:39] <nobknee> @sonofthedeepsouth I enjoy it. Got some neat deep old shit.
[1:09:43] <Seatherten> lets not boolshit about the lore its all over the place, they just put whatever they feel is cool
[1:09:45] <+Demonstrandum> I always found Pat's take on Warframe to be pretty on point: The early game is very much more of a shooter / few enemy melee game and it turns into a musou slaughter as you progress and get more AoE weapons and Warframe
[1:09:49] <$pennykettle_> I dont k ow anymore. Warframes lore seems built to have a massive groundbreaking twist every patch
[1:10:01] <Seatherten> ^
[1:10:03] <$pennykettle_> they want second dream over and over
[1:10:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> Fucking door hinges rock
[1:10:29] <Seatherten> bless you
[1:10:30] <mortelkilll> to be hoenst warframe has shit bosses
[1:10:31] <AMadHollow> @pennykettle_ I mean, adding actual content to a 7 year old game is good
[1:10:31] <SwagetronPrime> Fate/Extra is my favorite Musou
[1:10:44] <mortelkilll> best boss ive fought was tyl regor because he actually let yo udo damage to it normally
[1:10:49] <+PerrinIsDead> Plague imma put you in my pocket while I grab coffee creamer I hope it’s warm there
[1:10:54] <nobknee> I think they were surprised The Second Dream did so much for people, so they wanna have that every time, but you can't. Still, I enjoy when there actually is story to do. As opposed to none at all. Takin' their sweet fuckin' time with New War.
[1:10:57] <sonofthedeepsouth> Warframe lore is a huge shitpost the
[1:10:59] <Seatherten> you may like but it probably gonna turn into a cutscene kill
[1:11:00] <jiin6> Fate Extella is the musou
[1:11:04] <Seatherten> knowing this game
[1:11:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> Zabrak BTFO
[1:11:24] <AMadHollow> terrifying, corrosive gunners.
[1:11:30] <+onlypuppet> Super cute
[1:11:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Nice half second ragdoll.
[1:11:34] <TechGFennec> I just noticed the chat colours are different on the stream. That's going to be bothering me.
[1:11:37] <AMadHollow> we stand no chance until arca vandal
[1:11:41] <jiin6> oboeshCorrosion rbzGun
[1:11:43] <Seatherten> tfw the bad AI pathing saved him from killing himself and falling off a clif
[1:11:55] <$pennykettle_> best boss is the arena grineer
[1:11:59] <mortelkilll> i liked what i played of warframe but man i kind of hate most ennemies
[1:12:11] <+FadingEmber> The fact that you can't throw your lightsaber saddens me
[1:12:12] <laserbeaming> @TechGFennec I think that's for people who haven't set a color for themselves?
[1:12:13] <sonofthedeepsouth> Who are Nightbrothers fucking to keep their numbers? The zombies?
[1:12:17] <mortelkilll> the sentient are obnoxious, the infected are boring and the corpus are annoying
[1:12:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> The spiders thats it
[1:12:23] <mortelkilll> only the grinner are kinda fun
[1:12:31] <Aussie_Manny> The Fallen Jedi LUL
[1:12:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Fallen Jeid
[1:12:46] <TechGFennec> It might give random colours to those that don't have WEBSAFE colours. Which is stupid
[1:12:51] <AMadHollow> the infested used to be fun. until everybody was a massive swarm
[1:12:53] <bear_breaker20> jedi fallen over
[1:12:54] <Seatherten> there is no falling damage if you just double jmp out of it
[1:12:56] <Lapinelis> It's sekiro combat, just worse
[1:12:56] <Seatherten> LUL
[1:13:02] <SuperVaderMan> bad guys just aggressively hold onto ledges. Like you have to be in the perfect position to push them off
[1:13:13] <nobknee> No realistic lightsaber damage on humanoids. No Force Lightning. No Kyle Katarn. No Revan. No Yoda fightin' a samurai. Why pretend this is STARWARS?
[1:13:16] <Saterion> Have you played The Surge 2?
[1:13:20] <+victorvontzeentch> At least Purge Troopers just spawn near the edge of Cliffs 90% of the time
[1:13:21] <beetbo2> stormtroopers?
[1:13:24] <Seatherten> jedi force powers are the weakest shit in this game
[1:13:26] <beetbo2> don't those just exist to die
[1:13:28] <%JJCheeker> I didn't know the side of cliffs swing like doors
[1:13:31] <jiin6> Can't believe they made the jedi boring
[1:13:50] <TechGFennec> Yeah this doesn't look very Star Wars to me apart from the lightsaber
[1:13:53] <Seatherten> there is no maelstrom no great force shit
[1:14:00] <Seatherten> just push pull and stop
[1:14:11] <nobknee> Can't spam Force Storm. 0/10
[1:14:12] <beetbo2> I mean, you did
[1:14:17] <beetbo2> don't see a reason why not
[1:14:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> what a meme
[1:14:24] <SuperVaderMan> That's his home now
[1:14:27] <Twad_Feu> lol
[1:14:28] <Lapinelis> Did you play Sekiro, Plague?
[1:14:30] <beetbo2> wait are they floating?
[1:14:31] <Seatherten> i like that it has a RB jump finisher button but its just a normal attack while falling
[1:14:38] <Twad_Feu> the ever-watcher
[1:14:39] <+PerrinIsDead> Whoa interloper??
[1:14:45] <Ether101_Prime> I remember being able to knock the stronger bolts back at Nightbrothers.
[1:14:46] <Seatherten> it literally does nothing
[1:14:57] <%JJCheeker> oooo
[1:14:58] <Seatherten> WAS THAT A HIT
[1:15:00] <TardigradeRex> "Harder Daddy!"
[1:15:01] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hover
[1:15:01] <bear_breaker20> people who bought the game are unpaid QA for definitive edition LUL
[1:15:02] <BinaryBetrayer> Clapping him to death
[1:15:10] <TechGFennec> Oh this is going to take a while
[1:15:18] <sonofthedeepsouth> We got locked
[1:15:21] <Seatherten> throw the lightsaber or something
[1:15:22] <+victorvontzeentch> Saber throw
[1:15:22] <$SilverRoddo> His loin cloth is snagged on a protruding branch.
[1:15:25] <%JJCheeker> Come come my lady your my butterfly
[1:15:27] <jiin6> Prod him to desu
[1:15:28] <SuperVaderMan> Here he comes
[1:15:31] <laserbeaming> No Lightsaber throw I guess?
[1:15:31] <Lapinelis> This is literally killing him with a stiff breeze
[1:15:31] <StarlitStunner> spyCappa wowie one whole percentile
[1:15:34] <Seatherten> his ai pathing might prevent him from falling now
[1:15:34] <Ether101_Prime> Get back up there and throw you're lightsaber at them?
[1:15:35] <beetbo2> lightsaber throw??
[1:15:37] <TechGFennec> He ain't flying. He just forgot how to fall
[1:15:39] <Seatherten> he will never fall
[1:15:42] <beetbo2> throw your lightsaber
[1:15:48] <jbournehd> What is this
[1:15:50] <silverira> AMAZING!
[1:15:53] <beetbo2> RB + RT?
[1:15:56] <TechDragon_Z> A gun would be ideal right about now
[1:15:56] <BinaryBetrayer> Just shoot him
[1:15:57] <Seatherten> LUL
[1:15:59] <$SilverRoddo> This is intended.
[1:16:02] <viciousgrim> hello plague
[1:16:03] <TechGFennec> Oh boy
[1:16:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> HE IS MID AIR
[1:16:04] <nobknee> The fuck kinda controls are that?
[1:16:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> WTF
[1:16:08] <laserbeaming> LUL not enough range
[1:16:08] <Twad_Feu> a humble blaster would be so good right about now
[1:16:14] <TardigradeRex> This is canon, they can just fly now.
[1:16:25] <TechGFennec> He sure ain't falling for shit is he?
[1:16:28] <Seatherten> he fell ?
[1:16:30] <beetbo2> THEY FLY NOW??
[1:16:31] <Seatherten> LUL
[1:16:34] <BinaryBetrayer> He fell now.
[1:16:37] <nobknee> Yeah. Blasters and lightsaber together. Wonder if a game will ever do that. I should ask my bud Kyle about that.
[1:16:38] <Twad_Feu> he fell when you got at his Z level
[1:16:41] <Seatherten> that dude is the true master of the force
[1:16:44] <BinaryBetrayer> Nice AI
[1:16:44] <Fdrank> now THIS is podracing
[1:16:45] <StarlitStunner> brucegLaugh as George Lucas always intended
[1:16:52] <Wynzler> LOLOL
[1:16:53] <laserbeaming> his pathing got fucked?
[1:16:56] <jbournehd> What a champ
[1:16:58] <beetbo2> :LUL:
[1:16:59] <+victorvontzeentch> Try spinning
[1:17:00] <+FadingEmber> I've never seen any actaully throw their lightsaber before. I just thought it was omitted form the game.
[1:17:00] <TechGFennec> Now this is quality gamemaking
[1:17:04] <SuperVaderMan> That man led a very confused existence
[1:17:04] <TardigradeRex> I think they might actually be tied to a certain part of the map for peformance reasons.
[1:17:04] <TheWe4pon> i think he swung at you as you we're climbing @PlagueOfGripes
[1:17:05] <BinaryBetrayer> His everything got fucked.
[1:17:06] <beetbo2> that's a good trick
[1:17:06] <TechDragon_Z> "wAs ThAt A hIt?!"
[1:17:17] <jiin6> EA quality right here
[1:17:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> BREAK THE AI
[1:17:36] <Seatherten> plague it's still so fucking wild to me and dumb, that in a game full of jumps and ledges they didn't give AI a way to cross gaps or jump or whatever
[1:17:38] <+onlypuppet> Congrats
[1:17:39] <mortelkilll> im getting flashback of agermanspy playtrough of dark soul 2 with plague slow descent into despising this game
[1:17:47] <StarlitStunner> stripNote I see I see
[1:17:51] <mortelkilll> each minute just feel liek it raise another reason to hate the game
[1:17:55] <SuperVaderMan> "magickal" LUL
[1:17:58] <TechGFennec> Oh yeah mosshroom now that's quality lore
[1:18:30] <nobknee> Alright, I gotta shower. Enjoy this fake Disneywars ginger adventure.
[1:18:39] <Seatherten> it's so spastic its fantastic
[1:18:40] <jbournehd> How far in the game is this?
[1:18:44] <%JJCheeker> I just saw a photo of a spider Colony in Australia
[1:18:44] <jiin6> Spider husbandry
[1:18:50] <%JJCheeker> It was awful
[1:18:55] <Seatherten> spider husband?
[1:19:20] <jiin6> Spider colony drops
[1:19:34] <Twad_Feu> they have to be thrown places as children
[1:19:43] <TheWe4pon> literal tier system.
[1:19:43] <hntronium> Reach is nice
[1:19:46] <+victorvontzeentch> Reach Around is a good game
[1:19:48] <+GraceTBM> don't bother with reach
[1:19:50] <Futurecity10> Reach co-op is nice
[1:19:55] <Seatherten> ^
[1:20:05] <AJusticeLemon> yo that sounds great
[1:20:07] <TechGFennec> Why is Halo Reach a big thing all of a sudden?
[1:20:07] <+GraceTBM> the story in reach has some decent moments, but it mostly feels really flat
[1:20:12] <jbournehd> spooky
[1:20:16] <sonofthedeepsouth> There is actually social spiders in SA that make this giant webs to get larger Athropods
[1:20:21] <Seatherten> @TechGFennec cause it released on pc
[1:20:22] <+Demonstrandum> Reach is a solid shooter with a decent campaign that wont blow you out of the water
[1:20:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Joke's on you nightsister we're already dead where it counts.
[1:20:26] <%JJCheeker> prerecScience
[1:20:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> Play Halo Reach for memes
[1:20:28] <TechGFennec> Oh
[1:20:31] <mortelkilll> scocial spiders are rare torugh, msot spiders are solitary
[1:20:35] <TechGFennec> Ok fair enough
[1:20:48] <mortelkilll> but yeah scocial spiders are interesting
[1:20:52] <+victorvontzeentch> Its my favorite Halow
[1:20:53] <Seatherten> you can
[1:20:55] <hntronium> It wasn't amazing but it was decent
[1:20:55] <TechDragon_Z> Both
[1:20:59] <Twad_Feu> you can
[1:21:04] <+Demonstrandum> It's basically the essence of Halo before it went kinda apeshit from what I understand
[1:21:04] <%JJCheeker> It's my least favorite of the bungie Halo
[1:21:06] <DragonBornKing> i love reach for custom games and forge mode
[1:21:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> Play Halo Reach multiplayer and remember the little kids screaming racial slurs at you
[1:21:10] <mortelkilll> really weird that spiders are often treated liek they are ants in fantasy and sci fi
[1:21:10] <Zebroneath> You're multiplayer customization carries over to the campaign
[1:21:13] <+FadingEmber> Multiplayer custom carry over to single
[1:21:14] <%daveronald> did you actually get Mike Stoklasa for VA?
[1:21:15] <+victorvontzeentch> You have to play Multiplayer to get the armor
[1:21:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> Got I love the mute button
[1:21:24] <mortelkilll> even scocial spiders dotn have queen and stuff, they jsut live in large communities
[1:21:24] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:21:24] <%JJCheeker> You were 2 in 3 or still best
[1:21:26] <Seatherten> double jump denies fall damage
[1:21:28] <Seatherten> hell yeah
[1:21:31] <Seatherten> i would
[1:21:32] <+GraceTBM> When I started Reach again, I was surprised that the really subdued enemy reaction to gunfire actually made the guns feel really weak in the campaign
[1:21:33] <BinaryBetrayer> The physics behind a double jump would create weird situations.
[1:21:33] <JoshTheFace> yup
[1:21:34] <OlmStranger> I still haven't played the last one, despite putting countless hours in to every other game with Halo in the name.
[1:21:34] <TheWe4pon> the only halo game i have any interest in trying from the collection is ODST
[1:21:37] <$SilverRoddo> Maybe they have bad knees and heels. I mean, without a good pair of shoes, you can suffer from sore shins.
[1:21:37] <Exadata_> so many people would die
[1:21:40] <jiin6> Yeh
[1:21:45] <Lapinelis> Garuanteed they would
[1:21:45] <Seatherten> big open area huh
[1:21:45] <mortelkilll> time to fight a boss
[1:21:49] <%JJCheeker> Halo*
[1:21:51] <Seatherten> holds no tactical advantage
[1:21:55] <BinaryBetrayer> I sense a boss arena
[1:21:56] <TechGFennec> Is double jumping a force power canonically?
[1:21:59] <+Demonstrandum> Class warfare erupts between double jumpers and non-jumpers who evolved without booster pads on their feet
[1:22:00] <AJusticeLemon> you can change color and armor in campaign but to unlock more armor you gotta play multiplayer
[1:22:04] <Exadata_> so many broken ankles just from trying to jump shit
[1:22:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> Pretty much
[1:22:08] <Seatherten> @TechGFennec it is i guess
[1:22:17] <%Samex_Comex> Nooo caveman!
[1:22:36] <Seatherten> the whole spider hive had a turn with his pelvis
[1:22:38] <mortelkilll> its either the bat or a giant mass of force zombies
[1:22:41] <%JJCheeker> doesn't look like a boss arena at all
[1:22:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Nice T pose while the robot got on your shoulder.
[1:22:54] <jbournehd> Is this dart maul's cousin?
[1:22:56] <SuperVaderMan> Why is he messing with that dude's body? LUL
[1:22:56] <mortelkilll> welp you re fightign the bat
[1:22:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh yeah Boss rooms
[1:22:59] <Mizaiya> aw hes cute
[1:22:59] <Tiny_Axolotl> were is this story going?
[1:23:02] <Seatherten> wake him up obviously
[1:23:05] <Futurecity10> once I unlocked double ended lightsaber, I never switched off it
[1:23:07] <lethallylactic> It's so adorable though
[1:23:08] <BinaryBetrayer> Kill the dragon!
[1:23:08] <mortelkilll> man jedi really dont liek animals
[1:23:23] <DragonBornKing> wow what an exciting boss
[1:23:26] <@Nightbot> @TardigradeRex -> Beep Boop! [stop spamming symbols] [warning]
[1:23:27] <SuperVaderMan> He's gonna poke ya
[1:23:30] <lethallylactic> bonk
[1:23:31] <DragonBornKing> BIG SPOOKY SPACE BAT
[1:23:35] <mortelkilll> striking with its wing is really dumb
[1:23:37] <TechGFennec> @TardigradeRex Yes, in fact it would kill you more because there's more g's of acceleration when going from n velocity to a velocity in the oposite direction than there is going from n velocity to 0
[1:23:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> yet
[1:23:47] <Seatherten> i guess it wants you to switch targets from main body to a wing
[1:23:55] <hntronium> BELLY SMACK
[1:23:59] <hntronium> that's adorable
[1:24:06] <mortelkilll> yeah it really is
[1:24:06] <Seatherten> 4 whole attacks
[1:24:12] <lethallylactic> And camera LUL
[1:24:13] <Futurecity10> No, you're supposed to attack the wings
[1:24:16] <Seatherten> wow the devs realy outdane themselves
[1:24:19] <BinaryBetrayer> It fumbles around like a Skyrim Dragon
[1:24:19] <Triblade1992> There has to be some kind of trick to this
[1:24:23] <jbournehd> Shouldn't you be able to instantly saw off his tiny tiny legs with your state of art lightsaber?
[1:24:27] <Coeco> cute monster girl gorgara when
[1:24:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> the wings plague
[1:24:30] <mortelkilll> the trick is to hit it really hard
[1:24:32] <TechGFennec> Is this the Dark Souls of Star Wars games?
[1:24:33] <Mizaiya> video game logic tells me the red spot on his hed
[1:24:34] <$SilverRoddo> Now there’s a bat, man. mikeliveLoveThatJoker
[1:24:51] <Seatherten> wait he doesnt have 4 attacks
[1:24:52] <Futurecity10> No, plagues doing the fight wrong, but its not really a challenging fight
[1:24:53] <Seatherten> just 3
[1:24:59] <lethallylactic> He a chubby boy
[1:24:59] <DragonBornKing> all the boss fights in this game should be dark jedi
[1:25:02] <Seatherten> a fourth one Pog
[1:25:04] <%JJCheeker> This is the problem with giant boss enemies
[1:25:04] <jiin6> Camera the true boss
[1:25:15] <%Samex_Comex> If only you could shoot force lightning
[1:25:18] <DragonBornKing> this is just a rancor with wings
[1:25:24] <TardigradeRex> @TechGFennec :D
[1:25:28] <Seatherten> @Samex_Comex ikr
[1:25:29] <KnightofNights2> What difficulty is he playing?
[1:25:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Because it is a rancor with ings
[1:25:38] <%Samex_Comex> Or a gun
[1:25:41] <+Demonstrandum> Just wait until the second one spawns!"
[1:25:52] <Triblade1992> I get that for like one boss. But how many bosses did that in Dark Souls 2?
[1:25:54] <mortelkilll> just spam attacks and wont let you hit it
[1:25:56] <Seatherten> judging by screams this is the bloodborne boss
[1:25:59] <TechGFennec> Force lighting is a sith power. And force choke although Luke did it and didn't fall to the dark side
[1:26:03] <%JJCheeker> Pretty much what the nameless King fight is
[1:26:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> The camera is so shit
[1:26:16] <DragonBornKing> next one is gonna be covered in fur and long fabrics doing sick 900s
[1:26:18] <$SilverRoddo> Hey, bats can’t hover, they fly / glide like wild.
[1:26:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> But is itnthe game or plague
[1:26:24] <Mizaiya> oh yeah deal big damage
[1:26:35] <BinaryBetrayer> It's doing dragon shouts at you even.
[1:26:37] <TechGFennec> MASSIVE DAMAGE!
[1:26:49] <lethallylactic> wut
[1:26:57] <jbournehd> Why dont this bat just close the cave with rocks and pump gas into it, and keep pumping it in until you die?
[1:27:09] <TechGFennec> What gas?
[1:27:09] <Wynzler> No wonder the inhabitants of this world hate this bat, they can't jump over his shockwave attacks
[1:27:15] <mortelkilll> thats a bit complex for an animal
[1:27:19] <DragonBornKing> fart gas
[1:27:20] <mortelkilll> but flyign away would make sense
[1:27:20] <Mizaiya> i like how he has a special animation for hitting his butt
[1:27:23] <mortelkilll> or throwinmg rocks
[1:27:24] <lethallylactic> LUL ?
[1:27:29] <mortelkilll> bats are prett ysmart
[1:27:34] <Seatherten> he gone bro
[1:27:38] <+jorgamund> "fuck this, I'm out"
[1:27:38] <lethallylactic> well bye I guess
[1:27:41] <SuperVaderMan> smart animal, doesn't fight to the death for once
[1:27:43] <+Demonstrandum> cya lol
[1:27:44] <$SilverRoddo> Ground wave, huh? Cmon body explosion.
[1:27:52] <%JJCheeker> Do you get a force heal
[1:27:53] <mortelkilll> animals dont really fight in nature
[1:27:58] <Seatherten> stole his mojo
[1:28:01] <mortelkilll> they get a few hits in and go away
[1:28:01] <%Samex_Comex> That was batty
[1:28:05] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:28:07] <mortelkilll> well unless they thin kthey can kill
[1:28:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Later
[1:28:14] <mortelkilll> then they will keep hitting you
[1:28:16] <+Demonstrandum> Honestly, this could've been a Bloodborne boss if it screamed more and had more cloth physics
[1:28:16] <BinaryBetrayer> You could've just lightsaber climb through
[1:28:20] <TechGFennec> Force climb is not a power
[1:28:23] <+SoleilAstier> that animation
[1:28:27] <jbournehd> This one for you Morth!
[1:28:28] <Virokwet> does the force make you spiderman?
[1:28:29] <Wynzler> I actually love this powerup
[1:28:31] <SuperVaderMan> nyoom, here I go! LUL
[1:28:32] <Mizaiya> Force is old garbage
[1:28:32] <Seatherten> a force user that can just pull grab and push, cannot even fucking jump high, has to climb
[1:28:37] <TheWe4pon> yeh but he a bitch
[1:28:37] <Seatherten> this is such a shit show
[1:28:39] <Skeletonmanners> the Farce
[1:28:42] <Seatherten> ^
[1:28:43] <Seatherten> nice
[1:28:45] <Wynzler> It makes climbing walls not a pain in the ass
[1:28:47] <Zebroneath> Force made obsolete by tribal claws
[1:28:49] <BinaryBetrayer> I'm sure there's a store somewhere in the galaxy where you can buy some discounted off the record climbing kit.
[1:28:53] <Futurecity10> Everything
[1:28:54] <+Cevune> so this is why the sith are all about body modification
[1:28:55] <bear_breaker20> this game is VERY pro technology
[1:29:07] <Seatherten> force is for boomers
[1:29:10] <TechGFennec> IT's going to be very specific things obviously
[1:29:13] <lethallylactic> This nice loading screen.
[1:29:19] <sonofthedeepsouth> we saw two entire corpses in there. Is that thing even carnivorous
[1:29:29] <Futurecity10> Jedi are the wizards from harry potter
[1:29:41] <Mizaiya> Or just shoot the ground below them and make them fall
[1:29:41] <Triblade1992> Then use the Force to pull them down!
[1:29:42] <mortelkilll> bats are omnivores i think
[1:29:48] <Seatherten> your ally is shit just like you
[1:29:50] <KnightofNights2> @Plague Did you get spoiled on the ending?
[1:29:53] <$SilverRoddo> We gotta get the Climbing Claws over, the Force needs to lay down for this game mechanic.
[1:29:54] <BinaryBetrayer> Use the force to guide the bullets into their brains.
[1:29:57] <Wynzler> Also can we appreciate for one goddamn second that those moments where you shimmy between walls isn't scripted
[1:29:59] <Twad_Feu> force supresses common sense
[1:30:06] <+jorgamund> the Force is like a multi-tool: it does a lot of stuff, but doesn't do them better than the "real" tools
[1:30:07] <jbournehd> What are you doing on this planet anyway?
[1:30:12] <TardigradeRex> @mortelkilll Depends, some are vegitarian and some eat mostly bugs.
[1:30:13] <%JJCheeker> The force is inside bitterGasm
[1:30:13] <SuperVaderMan> lesson learned, the Force isn't my dad LUL
[1:30:13] <PeramFare> Depends on the species
[1:30:13] <Wynzler> You can even reverse your direction mid way if you need to
[1:30:24] <sonofthedeepsouth> Force Dad. Like Anakins
[1:30:31] <TechGFennec> Some bats are fruit eaters others eat bugs they are not omnivores @mortelkilll
[1:30:34] <lethallylactic> Yeah you gotta pray and allocate your skill points to get things done.
[1:30:35] <%JJCheeker> It's like the story of the drowning man
[1:30:37] <mortelkilll> oh ok
[1:30:43] <laserbeaming> Divine Forception
[1:30:43] <mortelkilll> it depend o nthe species yeah
[1:30:43] <Seatherten> that's the commons sane christianity rationale
[1:30:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> Remember how Anakin is supposed to be jesus christ
[1:30:47] <+Demonstrandum> If this sentiment were more popular I might appeciate religion a lot more, because that actually sounds devent
[1:30:52] <TechGFennec> Also blood drinking bats but they work weird
[1:30:54] <Seatherten> in the rural areas
[1:30:57] <BinaryBetrayer> My ally is the force. Kinetic force. From a fucking gun.
[1:31:03] <dynam0jones> but guns are uncivilized
[1:31:07] <mortelkilll> blood drinking kinda rare in nature and its mostly a parasite beheviour
[1:31:09] <jiin6> I miss kyle
[1:31:14] <Tiny_Axolotl> logic and christianity?
[1:31:16] <Twad_Feu> im partial for explosive force
[1:31:18] <bear_breaker20> swords useful too...
[1:31:19] <mortelkilll> blood drinker actually dont kil lthat much
[1:31:20] <Seatherten> gun is such a equalizer that it kills the space wizards
[1:31:21] <sonofthedeepsouth> Thanks God I guess
[1:31:23] <Saterion> Kyle Katarn?
[1:31:25] <$SilverRoddo> Like in sports, you are rewarded with “luck”, but you need to know what to do with said luck.
[1:31:25] <Wynzler> Do you think a real gun could go through a lightsaber? Not joking around, actually curious
[1:31:29] <rytisone> unless your shot gets reflected back at you
[1:31:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> Gun
[1:31:32] <%JJCheeker> Kyle is the best
[1:31:36] <SuperVaderMan> to be fair, it's a super sword that can cut through anything
[1:31:40] <mortelkilll> drinking blood a way to gather nutrient o nbigger prey without fighting them
[1:31:41] <lethallylactic> Gunslinger with precognitive abilities > Swordsman with precognitive abilities
[1:31:42] <laserbeaming> I think Star Wars people forgot what Kinetic Weapons are
[1:31:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> If only the Jedi liked Guns
[1:31:54] <Seatherten> the gun and force combo used to be canon in the books but guess what
[1:31:55] <StarlitStunner> Jaden Korr
[1:31:56] <mortelkilll> force guns would be so badass
[1:32:00] <TechGFennec> Yes and it also works weird with bigger things because it's not exactly efficient if you're big
[1:32:01] <Seatherten> disney happened
[1:32:02] <jbournehd> @SuperVaderMan not in this game
[1:32:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> If the ajedi used guns the clones would be fucked
[1:32:10] <KnightofNights2> Imagine bringing agun to a knife fight.
[1:32:18] <TechGFennec> Like bigger than insects
[1:32:20] <+SoleilAstier> Picture force Jesus with an AK
[1:32:22] <Seatherten> its probably something stupid
[1:32:24] <+BuriasDempsey> apparently solid slug rounds can go through the saber, which is why some bounty hunters used ballistic weapons in place of blasters to fight jedi.
[1:32:35] <lethallylactic> You haven't unlocked the Force Mario Wall Jump yet Kappa
[1:32:36] <+Demonstrandum> Unfortunately, toy laser guns really don't sell as well as sabers
[1:32:45] <Seatherten> and sudenly you are slow as shit
[1:32:46] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:32:48] <Triblade1992> Ouch
[1:32:54] <Seatherten> even tho you were much quicker on a wall before
[1:32:57] <rytisone> prepare to die
[1:32:58] <Seatherten> LUL
[1:32:58] <StarlitStunner> brucegCringe
[1:32:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yes Plague
[1:33:03] <mortelkilll> @TechGFennec kind of funny that the vampire is depicted as so deadly whe nblood drinking in nature is so non lethal
[1:33:10] <mortelkilll> well there are blodo diseases
[1:33:10] <TechGFennec> But this is drama time
[1:33:14] <Mizaiya> nice
[1:33:14] <%JJCheeker> Those claws are kind of pointless
[1:33:17] <lethallylactic> nice
[1:33:17] <jbournehd> bravo
[1:33:17] <mortelkilll> but blood drinking itself rarely kill
[1:33:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> dead
[1:33:25] <TechGFennec> Drama time has a -70% speed effect
[1:33:26] <bear_breaker20> @Seatherten thats a space marine
[1:33:29] <Seatherten> claws worked for like two walls and no longer
[1:33:46] <Seatherten> @bear_breaker20 ?
[1:33:49] <rytisone> the debris cant hurt you
[1:33:50] <Futurecity10> No, just climb like normal
[1:33:50] <Wynzler> You really shouldnt need to jump
[1:33:54] <Virokwet> no
[1:33:54] <mortelkilll> wish we could pla yas that bat, its better at climbing than us
[1:33:56] <jbournehd> How must you understand what you need to do?
[1:33:56] <Wynzler> Climbing is faster
[1:34:00] <Virokwet> climb dude
[1:34:04] <laserbeaming> If Ballistic weapons are effective agains Jedi... Why aren't there Railguns?
[1:34:06] <jbournehd> dig up stupid
[1:34:07] <$SilverRoddo> mikelivePalpatine use your jedi climbing claws and scale this wall now!
[1:34:11] <OlmStranger> I sure do like not being able to see what the character is doing.
[1:34:13] <bear_breaker20> srry meant for @SoleilAstier
[1:34:14] <TechGFennec> Yes but that's because vampires also represent overindulgence so they drink ALL of the blood
[1:34:29] <mortelkilll> good point
[1:34:30] <Wynzler> You got stuck on the wall
[1:34:31] <+Demonstrandum> I really don't understand why you'd make tese kinds of sequences hard. You clearly want to make them be a cool moment, but that goes away once you fail it ?!
[1:34:33] <Wynzler> It's pretty finicky
[1:34:33] <+jorgamund> @laserbeaming they still don't have proper video conferencing, railguns are a ways off
[1:34:35] <+SoleilAstier> @bear_breaker20 yes it is lol
[1:34:37] <TechGFennec> Oh wow buggo?
[1:34:40] <jbournehd> What are good hero
[1:34:40] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:34:47] <Skeletonmanners> you gotta force it
[1:34:56] <lethallylactic> Give him a hug
[1:34:59] <SuperVaderMan> Oh boy, are we gonna God of War
[1:35:01] <%Samex_Comex> The bat is a sith!?
[1:35:08] <Seatherten> his only fucking force abbility is push and pull AND gets fucking stuck grabbed
[1:35:09] <mortelkilll> i thin kthe bat just pissed
[1:35:10] <Seatherten> Like bro
[1:35:14] <Seatherten> its your one trick pony
[1:35:17] <+SoleilAstier> that looked so stupid
[1:35:17] <lethallylactic> I clapped
[1:35:19] <Seatherten> fucking push away the claws man
[1:35:21] <jiin6> The Force : Bitch you gonna die
[1:35:22] <mortelkilll> tiem to murder an innocent animal and drive it to extinction
[1:35:23] <Triblade1992> I thought it was "I have a bad feeling about this"?
[1:35:27] <jbournehd> ....Wait, did he just try to stab it's leg with a lightsaber?
[1:35:28] <%JJCheeker> Why do game still do this
[1:35:33] <jbournehd> Stab?
[1:35:33] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:35:35] <Daxalog> Nice
[1:35:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Not even a death screen
[1:35:37] <Virokwet> LUL
[1:35:38] <BinaryBetrayer> This is amazing
[1:35:42] <+Demonstrandum> STAR WARS!
[1:35:44] <+jorgamund> poor bat, he just wants to live his life
[1:35:48] <TechGFennec> @Triblade1992 he sure did
[1:35:51] <SuperVaderMan> Why even have you in control of this if it's gonna force you to do it anyway
[1:35:52] <deadstrat> Is this game even fun?
[1:35:57] <+JohnMcClane6194> sections like this make me hate playing video games
[1:35:57] <DragonBornKing> CINEMATIC GAMEPLAY
[1:36:02] <Gork_N_Mork> LUL
[1:36:02] <rytisone> amaaazing
[1:36:04] <mortelkilll> i guess the idea is that sicne the bat is "ugly" its a monster not a wild animal like the bird o nthe forest planet
[1:36:13] <aero160h> this game seems to be poorly made for this part
[1:36:14] <$SilverRoddo> That reminds of Frodo in the Two Towers ps2 game, he yells: “I’m dying!” during the intro boss battle, and you gotta save him. Good times.
[1:36:16] <TardigradeRex> Yes, not touching the controls is probably what makes death happen :D
[1:36:16] <Zebroneath> God of War did this better in implimitation
[1:36:17] <+eanscrale> Like peanutbutter and anchovies
[1:36:19] <mortelkilll> they really are the same to me, pissed off wild animals
[1:36:21] <Lapinelis> So star wars is full of big big big species, what if you made one of those a jedi or a sith?
[1:36:22] <Wynzler> Wow it's a good thing Cal has the power of god AND anime on his side
[1:36:22] <%JJCheeker> I hate qte
[1:36:23] <BinaryBetrayer> whow, just like the movie
[1:36:23] <Skeletonmanners> this game seems to be lacking in polish
[1:36:24] <deadstrat> geez
[1:36:27] <Wynzler> Unlimited retries
[1:36:28] <Lapinelis> How about a walking mountain sized sith
[1:36:28] <Tiny_Axolotl> Do the cutscene right XD
[1:36:34] <+jorgamund> infinite time loop, just like in the movies!
[1:36:41] <BinaryBetrayer> Press button, receive setpiece.
[1:36:52] <Triblade1992> Like either make it a cutscene, or justt don't
[1:36:56] <Skeletonmanners> it losing health in a cutscene is cute but also kinda dumb
[1:37:02] <+SoleilAstier> what is the point fo this bullshit right now
[1:37:05] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveFacepalm
[1:37:15] <lethallylactic> Kappa
[1:37:16] <mortelkilll> its kind of a cool boss but its also so dumb
[1:37:22] <ThirdPersonPhil> other than this is EA even doing games with cutscenes in them, or is it just multiplayer shooters and sportsballs
[1:37:25] <mortelkilll> also unessesary
[1:37:29] <aero160h> why?
[1:37:34] <TechGFennec> That droid looks like ROB
[1:37:41] <KnightofNights2> Do you still right Star Wars fanfiction?
[1:37:41] <+BuriasDempsey> I'm sorry what
[1:37:42] <deadstrat> what
[1:37:43] <laserbeaming> monkaS
[1:37:46] <lethallylactic> ?
[1:37:48] <mortelkilll> whut
[1:37:48] <+SoleilAstier> stream dead?
[1:37:50] <xcompleasedad> Wut
[1:37:51] <Unicyclemonkey> ???
[1:37:53] <+Demonstrandum> Star Wars!
[1:37:58] <Skeletonmanners> um
[1:37:59] <TechGFennec> Stream is alive for me
[1:37:59] <bear_breaker20> in my star wars novel*
[1:38:02] <laserbeaming> @SoleilAstier refresh?
[1:38:05] <TheWe4pon> the fuck
[1:38:10] <JoshTheFace> ?
[1:38:11] <Skeletonmanners> plague reminding everyone why they gutted extended universe
[1:38:17] <+eanscrale> Butterflies are cool
[1:38:17] <hntronium> Now this is podracing
[1:38:23] <xcompleasedad> sbfpSetIn
[1:38:24] <$SilverRoddo> High stakes, high tension, EA gameplay action. I love that song, “Jedi with Butterfly Wings”
[1:38:30] <jbournehd> oh god
[1:38:30] <Wynzler> Butterflies are like jesus
[1:38:31] <Wynzler> Or something
[1:38:37] <rytisone> yippee
[1:38:40] <Triblade1992> The action is too much
[1:38:40] <jiin6> Now this is butterfly racing
[1:38:48] <hntronium> I like action
[1:38:49] <%JJCheeker> Was this written by a 6 year old
[1:38:50] <bear_breaker20> action KappaPride
[1:38:50] <+jorgamund> good thing the entire EU is ret-conned then, right? Kappa
[1:38:51] <BinaryBetrayer> They're butterfly racing illegally beneath Corsucant, right?
[1:39:02] <Seatherten> "superhero movie" you mean capeshit
[1:39:06] <jbournehd> Nice segway
[1:39:08] <KnightofNights2> That sounds awful.
[1:39:13] <mortelkilll> yeah this make no damn sense
[1:39:14] <+ratchetex> no it has no real stakes so it sucks
[1:39:19] <mortelkilll> the freakin bat has n oreason to hunt us
[1:39:21] <Tiny_Axolotl> Pleae be excited
[1:39:25] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveSpace
[1:39:33] <rytisone> you must love Michael Bay movies
[1:39:35] <+QueequegTheater> Plague, what about Logan? That was superheroes but had actual emotional stakes
[1:39:36] <bear_breaker20> but be excited for product tho
[1:39:37] <Wynzler> EA: ....please clap
[1:39:48] <TechGFennec> But to make it interesting you need to go 100% all the time. Dramatic arcs are for wimps
[1:39:49] <+bitstorm_> like star trek
[1:39:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Yeah but it's STAR WARS
[1:39:56] <mortelkilll> logan has a lot of stuff where nothing happen, not that much action and its a strenght of it
[1:39:58] <hntronium> I don't particularly care about having meaning for everything
[1:40:02] <hntronium> sounds exhausting
[1:40:03] <Triblade1992> Mass Effect and mass effect 2 (alongside Dragon Age Origins) do SO MUCH BETTER
[1:40:07] <KnightofNights2> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[1:40:09] <+SoleilAstier> please clap... for nothing
[1:40:16] <dynam0jones> is this a Michael Bay game?
[1:40:23] <+jorgamund> it's exciting to kids
[1:40:27] <BinaryBetrayer> A long quality drop you could say!
[1:40:30] <mortelkilll> we re really wanting to kill this bat for no good reason
[1:40:35] <mortelkilll> it probably just got scared
[1:40:36] <xcompleasedad> Really?
[1:40:37] <laserbeaming> idk, having sequences for the sake of sequences sounds like a pretty Star Wars thing to me
[1:40:38] <+QueequegTheater> No but it's dark side tho
[1:40:39] <xcompleasedad> HAHAHAHAHAH
[1:40:40] <JoshTheFace> LUL LUL LUL
[1:40:42] <jbournehd> Is it ever explained how mc can understand his droid?
[1:40:43] <SuperVaderMan> Ok, so this is our hero just intentionally landing on the bat to kill it
[1:40:44] <xcompleasedad> INFINITE LOOP
[1:40:44] <+SoleilAstier> BAHAHAHA
[1:40:44] <Skeletonmanners> this bat really could just leave at any point
[1:40:45] <Triblade1992> Well the bat is attacking you
[1:40:50] <Seatherten> is this a spy kids refference?
[1:40:52] <lethallylactic> Also all this "high impact action" is just so messy because like the monster and the main character and the environment are all the same shades of muddy brown/rust red.
[1:40:53] <aero160h> infinite falling loop
[1:40:54] <Seatherten> forever falling
[1:40:55] <Wynzler> I wonder how long you can make that go for
[1:40:58] <mortelkilll> our hero, killign a rare endangered specy for no good reason
[1:41:00] <KnightofNights2> Use the Force?
[1:41:08] <+QueequegTheater> Plague it's a wild animal that keeps trying to destroy your fence
[1:41:09] <lethallylactic> D:
[1:41:09] <AJusticeLemon> loops
[1:41:11] <Skeletonmanners> why is this the same thing 5 times
[1:41:13] <Skeletonmanners> 1 would be enough
[1:41:14] <+eanscrale> At least the scene carries a a lot of gravity
[1:41:18] <Seatherten> the bat is old and a boomer
[1:41:23] <Triblade1992> Just make it a CUTSCENE! Either dont' make it interactive or just do
[1:41:24] <Wynzler> Oh so killing the gross looking monster on the ugly planet is A-OKAY
[1:41:26] <%Samex_Comex> You did it you beat the bat
[1:41:29] <lethallylactic> Pour one out for the bat :( F
[1:41:30] <jbournehd> NICE
[1:41:30] <hntronium> because its a monster and monsters only deserve to die
[1:41:31] <Wynzler> But no on the stupid hippie bear planet
[1:41:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:41:34] <thatzazzguy> is there a space peta that can protect this poor animal
[1:41:36] <Zebroneath> Did you even hit it during that cutscene?
[1:41:36] <+ratchetex> YES
[1:41:38] <+askalta> lol are you ok
[1:41:38] <%JJCheeker> I wish they would've let you fall to your death
[1:41:40] <Gork_N_Mork> Main character is into animal cruelty is my main take away
[1:41:41] <TechGFennec> "You ok?"
[1:41:41] <xcompleasedad> It was NEVER this dumb in the OT. Craziest shit that happened there was a motorcycle chase
[1:41:41] <KnightofNights2> Now scan it.
[1:41:42] <jiin6> Excite now... Pls
[1:41:46] <+BuriasDempsey> AND NOW THE SPECIES IS EXTINCT, WAY TO GO HERO
[1:41:54] <+Demonstrandum> Man, other videos I saw sure made this game look a lot less... shit ?
[1:41:57] <mortelkilll> @Wynzler yeah its very hypocriticial and i feel that the only difference is that the bat is "ugly"
[1:42:04] <+QueequegTheater> Plague you're cynical on a level I can't really identify with. Is that section great? No, but it was a cool visual setpiece
[1:42:12] <hntronium> COULD HE HAVE THOUGH
[1:42:12] <Seatherten> force could have just mushed its brain
[1:42:17] <Seatherten> with just PUSH AND PULL
[1:42:19] <jbournehd> The Skill Point Acquired had an impeccable comedic timing
[1:42:23] <Twad_Feu> Wharhammer got vargheist. that are close enough. The Cute bat monster legacy lives on.
[1:42:23] <TechGFennec> Oh so the protagonist is Nathan Drake act-alike then
[1:42:24] <laserbeaming> The only Setpieces I kind of enjoyed were the ones in Platinum Games. Specially Bayo 1
[1:42:26] <BinaryBetrayer> At least I got that climb shit
[1:42:29] <+Demonstrandum> @QueequegTheater Was it though ?
[1:42:30] <Triblade1992> That's why I like manga like Bleach, Jojo, etc which actually have exposition about their powers during the fighting
[1:42:43] <+SoleilAstier> Doesn't matter got a skill point
[1:42:46] <OlmStranger> How did big bats death impact the local ecosystem though? That's what I want to know.
[1:42:49] <+QueequegTheater> @Demonstrandum Ehh, it was fun.
[1:42:59] <+bitstorm_> jj abrams 😡
[1:43:06] <Seatherten> its not a good game, the AI is shit, the story is shit, the gameplay is shit
[1:43:09] <aero160h> Going by Star Wars lore, Jedi always fuck shit up for no good reason.
[1:43:13] <KnightofNights2> AND ME
[1:43:13] <Seatherten> the only thing it has going is the name star wars
[1:43:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> its made to create great streaming content
[1:43:32] <%JJCheeker> I would have preferred a boss fight instead of it ending with a cutscene
[1:43:33] <Wynzler> The funniest part about Star Wars is how much the jedi suck at their jobs
[1:43:36] <SuperVaderMan> I think it's supposed to be like they're smart enough not to shoot you after you reflect it the first time
[1:43:37] <$SilverRoddo> Guano is super important, Cal.
[1:43:46] <+SoleilAstier> Ment to appeal to dummies. So JJ wrote this? @PlagueOfGripes
[1:43:48] <Twad_Feu> I'd love to see a sequel with one player being the current MC with force powers, and the partner being a "normal" bloke with a gun, hack tool and grapple
[1:44:01] <Skeletonmanners> prepare to jedi?
[1:44:04] <%Samex_Comex> Orange flavored muals
[1:44:11] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:44:12] <Wynzler> Yeah I wonder how they're going to follow up to this
[1:44:15] <Wynzler> It sold pretty well
[1:44:37] <SuperVaderMan> It's funny that the most efficient thing to do is just to not interact with the combat at all, just pull and stab
[1:44:38] <xcompleasedad> Is there a downside o doing that? Just grab all fools?
[1:44:39] <mortelkilll> in the next game we kill more innocent giant bats
[1:44:49] <Seatherten> GUN is so good they have to reflect it to insta kill people
[1:44:51] <%Samex_Comex> What if the bat was their god?
[1:44:51] <Seatherten> LUL
[1:45:09] <$SilverRoddo> “You killed our Bat-Lord!” is proper motivation to kill the jedi man.
[1:45:10] <Seatherten> just jump on it
[1:45:18] <aero160h> Why is this games combat, press button watch animation?
[1:45:18] <TechGFennec> Wait are the enemies that seem to only have wooden buildings and tribal cothing attacking with sticks and blasters? Because that's quite the technological mess if I say so myself
[1:45:22] <mortelkilll> to be fair, peopel are kind of right whe nthey say that star wars isnt a stranger to stupid and unessesary action scenes
[1:45:28] <Triblade1992> maybe you are suppose to wall run?
[1:45:29] <TheWe4pon> wallrun
[1:45:45] <Seatherten> @aero160h EA game
[1:45:52] <Wynzler> Not blasters, the arrows are "magic"
[1:46:08] <TechGFennec> Ah well at least it's consistent
[1:46:17] <Wynzler> But functionally blasters
[1:46:21] <TechGFennec> It glows with the force
[1:46:24] <aero160h> @seatherten that doesn't explain anything
[1:46:27] <baker_doze> Nice,
[1:46:31] <Skeletonmanners> nioh and the surge are kinda similar but they let you hit them way more than just once per them running out of stamina
[1:46:45] <TechGFennec> The force is in everything but it only glows on arrows
[1:46:52] <mortelkilll> i like how in sekiro removign the starmian is an instan kill
[1:46:54] <+QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:46:58] <TechGFennec> Oh well
[1:47:03] <%JJCheeker> OK then
[1:47:03] <TechGFennec> That's a bust
[1:47:10] <+Violated_Muffins> Violated_Muffins subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:47:12] <+Violated_Muffins> Violated_Muffins's Sub shared rewards to 5 others in Chat! 
[1:47:13] <Triblade1992> maybe you are suppose to wall run from that pulling down stuff?
[1:47:20] <rytisone> can plague figure it out?
[1:47:23] <+QueequegTheater> I think you can pull both sections of the floor down
[1:47:40] <JohnEagle> wall run on those
[1:47:42] <bear_breaker20> this is interesting from a qa perspective
[1:47:50] <Triblade1992> run on those walls maybe?
[1:47:59] <+FadingEmber> @PlagueOfGripes you need to wall run
[1:47:59] <+BuriasDempsey> is there even wall running?
[1:48:15] <Wynzler> Woo!
[1:48:15] <Triblade1992> knew it
[1:48:16] <+BuriasDempsey> oh, I guess there is
[1:48:17] <jbournehd> you...... did it
[1:48:18] <+SoleilAstier> YAY
[1:48:21] <%Violated_Muffins> Long time fan of your art Eli. Keep doing you!!!! <3
[1:48:26] <%JJCheeker> That was a little confusing though
[1:48:52] <Wynzler> Hey you broke their piss pots
[1:48:59] <jbournehd> This game feels like it has been drained of fun
[1:49:26] <+QueequegTheater> Well yeah, Plague is the one playing it
[1:49:53] <TechGFennec> If no one lives then no one knows you were there
[1:49:58] <Twad_Feu> his version of stealth involve genocide... No one can report if there's no one to report
[1:50:02] <TechGFennec> Giant bats included
[1:50:17] <deadstrat> @jbournehd I agree
[1:50:28] <+SoleilAstier> DS2 lol
[1:50:46] <+QueequegTheater> OH YEAH
[1:50:47] <+ratchetex> it needs to be a balance
[1:50:51] <+QueequegTheater> The fire dog?
[1:50:55] <Skeletonmanners> yea its important to strike the balance between hard and annoying
[1:51:00] <jbournehd> Playing a ginger character means genocide is the only choice
[1:51:03] <bear_breaker20> or normies on fighting games
[1:51:15] <+Risingxiv> I feel the gameplay should be made to compliment the difficulty
[1:51:25] <+bitstorm_> last boss in sekiro for me
[1:51:27] <+QueequegTheater> @PlagueOfGripes The worst is the one where your HP is cut in half and have to fight Amygdala
[1:51:27] <lethallylactic> Undead Giant I think is the name
[1:51:34] <mortelkilll> i dont enjoy beign stuck but i like overcomign a challenge
[1:51:43] <jbournehd> Is this how zoomers stretch their arms?
[1:51:43] <Twad_Feu> I dont recall puzzles in this game having more than one set solution. Not much room to be clever.
[1:51:49] <mortelkilll> watchdog of the old lord cursed chalice
[1:51:49] <+SoleilAstier> That kind of ppl are broken in some way
[1:51:57] <+FadingEmber> That feels about as gratifying as Shiny hunting in pokemon
[1:52:15] <+eanscrale> Kiting around the undead giant for twenty minutes was not my idea of a good time either
[1:52:20] <$SilverRoddo> Dab stretches are important.
[1:52:22] <+BurkeBigsby> Felt like that with Sekiro's equipment.
[1:52:26] <rytisone> if the frustration is bigger than the reward then it's not worth it
[1:52:30] <+SoleilAstier> Shiny hunting lol @FadingEmber
[1:52:58] <jbournehd> backflip into afterlife
[1:53:27] <+QueequegTheater> Just make it automatic like in Monster Hunter
[1:53:48] <mortelkilll> having complex manoeuvre is not alway fun
[1:53:49] <$SilverRoddo> InFamous has no grab button.
[1:54:19] <guardian_collin> inFamous is a good game
[1:54:19] <TechGFennec> Oh I see he's from space mexico
[1:54:20] <Cyral_Drive> I was hoping for jedi robes
[1:54:24] <%JJCheeker> Yeah all these puncho suck
[1:54:24] <guardian_collin> I enjoyed it
[1:54:25] <Cyral_Drive> Anything but the poncho
[1:54:37] <prazoez> what about jedi armour like obi wan's
[1:54:40] <Tiny_Axolotl> whats the story now?
[1:54:47] <jbournehd> Wearing poncho wont make you Clint Eastwood
[1:54:55] <jellymilkowo> put the poncho on his head
[1:55:02] <jbournehd> Yeah, what is it
[1:55:11] <Skeletonmanners> oh god
[1:55:16] <+pyrojack6> dolovite is my name
[1:55:19] <+QueequegTheater> Oh man I love when ancient memories get unearthed
[1:55:27] <+askalta> i thought you were gonna say it reminds you of your house
[1:55:48] <LunarRemix> It would probably feel less like a game and more like a movie if you didn't have to press the grab button.
[1:55:50] <jbournehd> btw what are those cavedrawings are about?
[1:55:53] <+QueequegTheater> When I watched Yu Yu Hakusho last year, I found out via massive nostalgia wave that I had watched it once as a child and totally forgotten about it
[1:55:58] <jbournehd> Maybe theres something interesting in them?
[1:56:02] <+QueequegTheater> Great feeling
[1:56:05] <%Violated_Muffins> @PlagueOfGripes Have you been watching Doctor Stone?
[1:56:08] <Lenmutt> Good show.
[1:56:12] <$SilverRoddo> The Landoflorian?
[1:56:25] <%Scarnehu> going to lay down for a nap. not usually up at this time of day and my body is fighting me
[1:56:28] <Lenmutt> I heard they patched the vines are they better Eli?
[1:56:32] <prazoez> i believe the grab button is too make sure cal holds on
[1:56:46] <Triblade1992> @QueequegTheater Yu Yu Hakusho only works in anime format because the manga is riddled with filler. the first arc (resurrection) has like 11 chapters not animated. it's 60% filler
[1:57:06] <+QueequegTheater> Dr. Stone pretty good, it's a shonen where the power system is (relatively) accurate scientific knowledge
[1:57:31] <%Violated_Muffins> @PlagueOfGripes its basically Deus ex Science the anime
[1:57:33] <Lenmutt> @Triblade1992 filler aka Togashi kept on dying.
[1:57:42] <prazoez> there is so much back tracking in this game which i feel is fine and the shortcuts are ok but i feel that possibly a force speed move could make it seem less tedious
[1:58:09] <Triblade1992> @Lenmutt Actually, that was well before that. Yu Yu hakusho didn't have Togashi dying till later on in Chapter Black
[1:58:11] <Lenmutt> Back on Ventress' planet?
[1:58:14] <BinaryBetrayer> Just use the force, force user.
[1:58:38] <Triblade1992> So Togashi was making filler even when he was feeling good
[1:59:16] <Lenmutt> @Triblade1992 ah my bad.
[1:59:47] <%Samex_Comex> My muscles block light sabers
[1:59:48] <prazoez> the games programmed to punish you for being greedy with attacks
[1:59:52] <+bitstorm_> it does seem like it would be an unsatisfying mechanism
[1:59:55] <Lenmutt> Did Eli fight the big lass yet?
[2:00:05] <Daxalog> Thats really cool!
[2:00:13] <jbournehd> owned
[2:00:13] <mortelkilll> he fought the 9th sister
[2:00:17] <FairOnFire> does the slomo denote his own parry? and that's why he's swinging?
[2:00:21] <jacob2pop> yello
[2:00:22] <SuperVaderMan> And this is just 1 enemy. There's usually like 3 enemies that do this at the same time
[2:00:29] <jellymilkowo> the win button
[2:00:40] <Lenmutt> @mortelkilll what did he think of that boss fight?
[2:00:48] <prazoez> i get it when lightsabers dont cut people in half in order to make a better combat system but why did they make it so that stormtroopers dont split in half when you kill them
[2:00:54] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Hello.
[2:01:00] <mortelkilll> dont quite remember
[2:01:05] <TheWe4pon> Because age rating
[2:01:18] <Lenmutt> okay i'll go watch that video later.
[2:01:28] <jacob2pop> The dismemberment mechanic from The Surge would have been cool for this game
[2:01:34] <Wynzler> Because ESRB bullshit
[2:01:38] <ThirdPersonPhil> i tough they were shark fins
[2:01:50] <guardian_collin> never called the ESRB bs
[2:02:01] <guardian_collin> its the only thing holding the government back
[2:02:03] <prazoez> ninth sister is shrek
[2:02:03] <Wynzler> No yellow shrek is the ninth
[2:02:12] <Lenmutt> Second Sister his baby Darth Vader, Ninth Sister is big lass
[2:02:14] <jbournehd> what is your character's character?
[2:02:16] <$SilverRoddo> Use your butt-stomp, to break the floor boards.
[2:02:21] <+QueequegTheater> @guardian_collin No, the ESRB has completely failed to actually do its job
[2:02:22] <%Samex_Comex> Not human stairs
[2:02:34] <+QueequegTheater> I welcome the government banning lootboxes
[2:02:36] <guardian_collin> @QueequegTheater I dunno video games are still allowed to exist
[2:02:43] <guardian_collin> government wouldnt ban them
[2:02:43] <jacob2pop> Its lady Darth Vader
[2:02:51] <guardian_collin> they would just tax them for more money
[2:02:55] <prazoez> that blue doorway looks like something. hmmm i wonder
[2:02:55] <Triblade1992> I thought Baby Darth Vader was Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren
[2:02:55] <Wynzler> As someone that disagrees with censorship as a whole, yeah the esrb is stupid
[2:02:55] <Lenmutt> Eli have you liked any boss fights in this game?
[2:02:59] <deadstrat> llol
[2:03:10] <Lenmutt> @Triblade1992 that's darth emo
[2:03:13] <$pennykettle_> incredibe
[2:03:23] <mortelkilll> dont think he disliekd the bosses
[2:03:28] <prazoez> hes getting it
[2:03:31] <jacob2pop> @triblade1992 no I said lady, not baby
[2:03:32] <$SilverRoddo> Lift with your legs, Callie.
[2:03:49] <Lenmutt> oof
[2:03:58] <Lenmutt> that's worse than not liking them hahah.
[2:03:59] <jbournehd> Force is my ally, I will now push this box
[2:04:48] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Boss fights in general or in just this kind of games?
[2:04:55] <mortelkilll> thing is there very little character ub tgus gane
[2:05:03] <ThirdPersonPhil> and boss fights are normally not designed to be replayable and that can make them into boring gameplay segments
[2:05:10] <$pennykettle_> hate how all souls games need a boss at the end of each area. it feels artificial. ds1 felt really natural in placement, and it felt more like the in-between matters more. I hate when someone streams a souls game and everyone is constantly asking what bosses they've done
[2:05:10] <Lenmutt> I am alil upset that the lightsaber fights in this game feel like you are playing the boss' game and doesn't feel like a duel.
[2:05:12] <laserbeaming> Is there any bossfight you really like? @PlagueOfGripes
[2:05:15] <Virokwet> yup
[2:05:21] <prazoez> do you like i in games where your forced to run from this giant enemy until you lure it into something that damages it which then allows you to defeat it.
[2:05:43] <+golazogreen30> i know how do do it whats confusing
[2:05:45] <mortelkilll> @pennykettle_ people will usually do that to gaige how far in the game they are. especially if the game is non linear
[2:06:11] <jbournehd> What a hero
[2:06:11] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I find boss fights to be the better parts of the game since they're supposed to be a test of the game's mechanics.
[2:06:27] <mortelkilll> depending on the genre
[2:06:33] <jbournehd> This is no Pequad
[2:06:33] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> That it does.
[2:06:36] <prazoez> the mantis paints arent too good in my opinion
[2:06:49] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I was mainly thinking of platformers.
[2:06:50] <Lenmutt> Greez like black i guess.
[2:06:56] <mortelkilll> in most games they are some of my favorite parts as they have very complex patterns and mechanics
[2:07:00] <mortelkilll> also spectacle
[2:07:16] <+PerrinIsDead> Man this is unrelated to anything but I saw that the actor who plays Odo from DS9 passed away last night. Hope to see Eli, Pat, and Paige watch the show when TNG is done
[2:07:21] <rytisone> cmonBruh
[2:07:32] <FairOnFire> that's such a weird collectable to get considering how little you look at the ship
[2:07:34] <StarlitStunner> brucegScared
[2:07:38] <Cyral_Drive> They didn't need to bother with mantis skins. Also impossible to suspend my disbelief finding ship paint jobs in chests
[2:07:49] <xerrres> "getting real tired of seeing black ones " - Plague
[2:07:53] <$pennykettle_> I haven't watched DS9 but I know the guy that died from Fallout NV
[2:07:58] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveHulkSmirk
[2:08:20] <prazoez> i mean if they added space dog fights i guess they would add more too mantis customization
[2:08:22] <mortelkilll> wow they really are all black
[2:08:28] <Skeletonmanners> i wouldnt be surprised if lack of quality of life and qa in this game is cuz of ea sabotaging this game to kill respawn
[2:08:29] <+PerrinIsDead> @pennykettle_ I didn’t know Rene was in New Vegas!
[2:08:34] <Skeletonmanners> wouldnt be first time they tried to do that to respawn
[2:08:53] <rytisone> maul the mauls
[2:08:54] <Lenmutt> poor mini mauls no match for da force
[2:09:03] <$pennykettle_> Perrin he's Mr House isn't he? maybe im mixing up deaths. a few people died yesterday
[2:09:07] <laserbeaming> how was this race called? Zabrak?
[2:09:32] <TechGFennec> Are there games that take the RIGHT lessons from Dark Souls?
[2:09:41] <+PerrinIsDead> @pennykettle_ Yeah I just googled and he is Mr. House! Played the game before I’d seen DS9 so I didn’t recall
[2:09:41] <guardian_collin> @TechGFennec Niho
[2:09:52] <Lenmutt> @laserbeaming i think they are zabrak that are taking by the nightsisters
[2:09:54] <mortelkilll> its arguable that dark soul took the right lessons from dark soul
[2:09:56] <jbournehd> how many monster closets do you have plague?
[2:09:57] <TechGFennec> Niho?
[2:10:00] <TardigradeRex> Enemies should be standing out in the opening, all natural like :D
[2:10:02] <TheWe4pon> why does the leader sound different from the others?
[2:10:06] <TardigradeRex> open
[2:10:16] <Lenmutt> like archers?
[2:10:27] <BinaryBetrayer> It'd be dickish if they put an enemy there, with a giant bow...
[2:10:37] <laserbeaming> @TechGFennec probably meant Nioh.
[2:10:37] <Lenmutt> oh hey an archer
[2:10:39] <tanarath> What about 'this door is locked from the other side', Plague?
[2:10:45] <$pennykettle_> I didn't play Nioh but it seems like the stance system would have been better for Star Wars
[2:10:49] <guardian_collin> oh fuck that garbage
[2:10:50] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> The archer class really made of archers.
[2:10:57] <TechGFennec> Nioh sure didn't get the right lesson tho
[2:11:03] <laserbeaming> Oh yeah, fuck the hard lock ons in DS2
[2:11:07] <Lenmutt> What is the best souls like game that is't from From Software?
[2:11:23] <$pennykettle_> "this door can't be opened from this side" felt really overdone in DS3
[2:11:34] <mortelkilll> salt and sanctuary?
[2:11:36] <tanarath> pennykettle_, they had it in Dark Forces and Jedi Academy.
[2:11:40] <BinaryBetrayer> They need those star wars sci fi things for the player to notice and interact with!
[2:11:43] <guardian_collin> I hated how in Dark Souls enemies actually felt like they had weight only for my stupid ass going into Dark souls 2 watching my back stabs get deleted because lul Im weightless
[2:11:44] <laserbeaming> Nioh took *some* right lessons, but it's doing enough of its own thing that I'm not sure what wrong lessons it took from DS
[2:11:44] <+PerrinIsDead> @pennykettle_ Jedi Outcast had stances back in the day
[2:11:47] <$SilverRoddo> This Maul men need gimmick arrows, like bomb arrows, poison arrows, snake arrows, etc.
[2:11:50] <kiwicoffin> Gears and pulleys and the wedge
[2:12:02] <$pennykettle_> hollow Knight is a metroidvania that took good lessons from DS I guess?
[2:12:29] <jbournehd> and suddenly, dramatic music
[2:12:30] <BinaryBetrayer> This looks like a cooler Warframe Mars
[2:12:35] <Lenmutt> always bothered me that one door never opens in bloodborne... despite being an obvious shortcut
[2:12:44] <laserbeaming> My main gripe when I think of Nioh is that it's pretty much a Wiki game and it's got mechanics on top of mechanics.
[2:12:49] <mortelkilll> really hate how warframe kind of just made generic environenements out of the planets
[2:12:52] <kiwicoffin> Special powers Cal isn't having visions and that means he's ok
[2:12:55] <SuperVaderMan> "He saw someone on this planet full of people. Nah, I'm sure he's just crazy"
[2:13:00] <mortelkilll> the planets dont look like the planets they should be
[2:13:23] <BinaryBetrayer> I'm really dissapointed in how Mars looks in real life.
[2:13:39] <tanarath> @mortelkilll That's the point, they were all terraformed a long time ago.
[2:13:42] <mortelkilll> still could make a sci fi mars look good by keepig nthe idea of a frozen desert
[2:13:42] <Lenmutt> Unit 01 BD is neat.
[2:13:50] <mortelkilll> yeah but they are terraformed in generic ways
[2:13:57] <tanarath> The Orokin were super powerful.
[2:14:04] <laserbeaming> RL Mars looks kind of like a big version of The Great Canyon
[2:14:17] <mortelkilll> i get the idea of venus being teraformed into a frozen planet but it doesnt look like a lava planet artificially frozen, it just look like a cold planet
[2:14:25] <FairOnFire> looks like a little race car
[2:14:31] <mortelkilll> to be fair the orb vallis does look liek what venus should be
[2:14:39] <guardian_collin> orb vallis is a joke
[2:14:50] <Skeletonmanners> wouldnt say all but theres some stinkers
[2:14:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> they are all references
[2:15:01] <mortelkilll> i just meant the visual of the orb vallis represent betetr that venus is stil la lava planet underneath
[2:15:02] <+SoleilAstier> FightersZ is real bad
[2:15:08] <+SoleilAstier> with colors
[2:15:14] <rytisone> he cant use the force from the other side of the door?
[2:15:18] <DickChapyGaming> there's maybe a handful of characters in FighterZ with good alternates. base Goku and DBS Broly have some decent ones
[2:15:28] <FairOnFire> both those developers like to choose colors to reference other characters
[2:15:30] <TechGFennec> Colour theory with plahue?
[2:15:32] <darkbotle> half the time their alt colors are just references
[2:15:35] <TechGFennec> Plague*
[2:15:36] <BinaryBetrayer> That's some dark side finisher shit
[2:15:38] <tanarath> I think they'll redo evironments.
[2:15:42] <Lenmutt> Kneesocks Parasoul looks great
[2:15:52] <mortelkilll> another exemple is that mars is a cold desert but they didnt render the lighting to reflect that
[2:15:56] <mortelkilll> it look too warm
[2:15:58] <kiwicoffin> Either you deal with the jank or become the jank
[2:16:07] <tanarath> I understand why they do it, even if it isn't good.
[2:16:21] <mortelkilll> well yeah they have map templates
[2:16:36] <mortelkilll> jupiter look pretty darn good and is creative i think
[2:16:39] <mortelkilll> the new jupiter
[2:16:39] <tanarath> Mars is mostly underground base, did they change it?
[2:16:52] <mortelkilll> mars nowaday is surface rock deserts
[2:16:58] <mortelkilll> my issue is the war mlighting
[2:17:01] <darkbotle> a-are those bow-blasters?
[2:17:08] <DickChapyGaming> damn Zabraks, having no real culture or identity outside of Darth Maul
[2:17:08] <tanarath> oh, the phobos tileset?
[2:17:15] <FairOnFire> god i wish you could turn npc barks off
[2:17:20] <mortelkilll> also i have a small pet peeves about uranus being the water planet and neptune beign the ice planet
[2:17:25] <rytisone> a big detour
[2:17:36] <tanarath> Yeah, they need to give Mars its own feel.
[2:17:38] <jbournehd> It's really sad that all you did on this planet is kill people who call each other brothers and eliminate rare wildlife
[2:17:39] <$SilverRoddo> He became what he loved, murdered.
[2:17:56] <guardian_collin> Plains was the only good open world in Doorframe
[2:18:05] <BinaryBetrayer> Grindframe
[2:18:14] <mortelkilll> i get that they are using generic tilesets but they really dont fit the planets in many cases
[2:18:14] <guardian_collin> Orb is literally just a giant open ice tundra
[2:18:15] <Lenmutt> There are alot of colours too per character and some have very different shading like Fillia Fiona
[2:18:20] <guardian_collin> like literally next to nothing t odo on it
[2:18:32] <mortelkilll> orb has the fiery sky , the fissures and the fungal growth trough
[2:18:36] <%Violated_Muffins> Studying physics while watching a game that flaunts in the very face of it is quite the experience
[2:18:37] <jbournehd> This whole planet is a tomb now
[2:18:37] <LordSDB> wONDEr what happen to that creepy old man
[2:18:39] <$SilverRoddo> Time to go get the Soul Stone.
[2:18:40] <mortelkilll> thats what i mean, lava planet artificially frozen
[2:18:53] <mortelkilll> in msot venus map it just look like a generic ice map
[2:19:01] <jbournehd> toss me a whut
[2:19:08] <Fodderbot> oh man this game has a drug droid?
[2:19:08] <mortelkilll> also the corpus maps are way to odarn blue
[2:19:10] <Lenmutt> was kinda neat in TCW seeing bunch of zombies attacking Grievous
[2:19:12] <kiwicoffin> I guess burying your dead in the swamp is a bridge too far
[2:19:14] <+HorribleHog> excited about new product : |
[2:19:20] <darkbotle> it'snot like there is actually a lot going on on the other planets and moons
[2:19:22] <mortelkilll> put some other darn colros than blue for corpus maps
[2:19:22] <BinaryBetrayer> Ancient temple with a Star Wars scifi cosmetic loot box!
[2:19:22] <%Samex_Comex> snap into a slim jim
[2:19:33] <Lenmutt> need a neon pink ship
[2:19:33] <SuperVaderMan> Why even have different paint jobs when they're just nothing
[2:19:40] <Lenmutt> just to mix it up
[2:19:45] <guardian_collin> foxy Grandpa
[2:19:51] <+GraceTBM> Plague you know that two of those are intentionally the millenium falcon and slave 1, right?
[2:20:06] <jbournehd> is this the prequels of star wars videogames?
[2:20:15] <DickChapyGaming> he's probably the reason they stopped granting passage
[2:20:16] <Seatherten> "yet not a welcome one" wow nice one
[2:20:20] <+BuriasDempsey> mind trick?
[2:20:22] <Wynzler> Because story reasons
[2:20:26] <BinaryBetrayer> Because ginger
[2:20:26] <rytisone> you'll learn why
[2:20:29] <kiwicoffin> I think the trip to dathomir happened before meeting tarful
[2:20:35] <Lenmutt> hahah I knew he'd say exactly that
[2:20:43] <+HorribleHog> wow that effect just blinked out of existence
[2:20:44] <darkbotle> speak friend and enter
[2:20:47] <LordSDB> Oh okay. Ty palgue
[2:20:53] <mortelkilll> it make sense that they have to make stuff up to make the planets interesting in warframe but they really are not using the unique conditions of each world and just use generic themes
[2:21:16] <BinaryBetrayer> Why is he cosplaying as Ben Kenobi
[2:21:24] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:21:25] <%Samex_Comex> Force crack
[2:21:27] <Wynzler> I want to kick him
[2:21:28] <Lenmutt> Force crack squeeze?
[2:21:29] <rytisone> to fit into Merrin
[2:21:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> i hate the walk cycles in this game
[2:21:39] <xerrres> Favle vibes
[2:21:46] <deadstrat> Horrible
[2:21:46] <Seatherten> he walks like he didn't wipe all the way
[2:21:52] <kiwicoffin> He's going to learn force fucked by the empire
[2:21:53] <mortelkilll> really excited to murder you later kid
[2:21:56] <darkbotle> mars is a red, flat desert, venus is just a burning hellscape, mercury as well, the gas planets don't even have a surface
[2:21:58] <jbournehd> hooman conversation
[2:21:59] <SuperVaderMan> Oh I think you can give one of these guys a hi5
[2:22:00] <xerrres> Fable
[2:22:07] <Ynkubus18> G O N K
[2:22:09] <ThirdPersonPhil> it looks like a buff stunt double was mocaped and then they putted all this animations on this scrawny boy
[2:22:12] <mortelkilll> well yeah but those should be the basis for terraforming
[2:22:13] <deadstrat> GONK
[2:22:16] <Lenmutt> looks like a lil police trash can, very adorable
[2:22:20] <Seatherten> @darkbotle there is cores in gas planets
[2:22:22] <Cyral_Drive> Smonk
[2:22:23] <Seatherten> there are*
[2:22:25] <Wynzler> Wow fuck off clone douche
[2:22:29] <mortelkilll> jupiter gas city is wel lhandled i find
[2:22:34] <guardian_collin> false sense of power
[2:22:35] <+askalta> hes chaffing
[2:22:38] <FairOnFire> to avoid clipping
[2:22:40] <jbournehd> That's a swagger walk
[2:22:41] <Seatherten> thats how i walked when i was 11 years old
[2:22:42] <kiwicoffin> 70's shoulder pads
[2:22:43] <laserbeaming> That robot looks stupid
[2:22:44] <mortelkilll> a gaz harvest floating facility aroudn the planet
[2:22:47] <darkbotle> ye, but that really doesn't count :D
[2:22:48] <deadstrat> Hubris
[2:22:50] <+PerrinIsDead> Big dick energy plague
[2:22:52] <alextrebeken> cuz hes like 7 and has a lightsaber
[2:22:54] <BinaryBetrayer> He's either very small or that's a huge lightsaber
[2:22:55] <Skeletonmanners> i defended skullgirls's palettes earlier saying theres some good ones but now i realised all good ones are reference colors
[2:22:55] <FairOnFire> walking like mcgregor
[2:23:03] <TechGFennec> So a kid trying to look like a tough guy? That's weirdly realistic
[2:23:08] <ThirdPersonPhil> little time to polish mocap
[2:23:11] <guardian_collin> mcgregor weighs like 150 potatoes
[2:23:12] <Lenmutt> true next gen is when hair and clothing doesn't clip consistently
[2:23:16] <+eanscrale> All the walking and running animations this feel super weird in this
[2:23:18] <darkbotle> no running in the hallway!
[2:23:19] <Seatherten> they all have the gold paint
[2:23:22] <TardigradeRex> You were running, of course you're in a rush.
[2:23:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Rounder armor
[2:23:27] <+DakotaMacDoodle> My guess is the animation are wonky do to this game being rushed because EA
[2:23:32] <laserbeaming> Buff-troopers
[2:23:39] <rytisone> yeah, buddys for life
[2:23:40] <jbournehd> Bruh
[2:23:47] <FairOnFire> secret handshake PogChamp
[2:23:51] <SuperVaderMan> I appreciate the hi5, it was cute
[2:23:59] <Wynzler> Story reasons
[2:24:05] <TechGFennec> Isn't this a learning lightsaber?
[2:24:10] <Seatherten> he looks so ugly
[2:24:15] <Seatherten> didn't know brits were jedi
[2:24:16] <guardian_collin> its friggen werid they use live weapons for training
[2:24:17] <jbournehd> Is this Skrull?
[2:24:19] <mortelkilll> his design isnt great
[2:24:23] <%Samex_Comex> It's the danger room
[2:24:23] <$SilverRoddo> Yes, danger room.
[2:24:23] <guardian_collin> like especially with a kid
[2:24:32] <Lenmutt> oh master what'shisface has the jedi armour bits always liked that over the homeless space robes
[2:24:34] <laserbeaming> It's like having a tutorial halway through the game
[2:24:34] <TardigradeRex> Bamboozled. LUL
[2:24:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Wall run or something
[2:24:35] <Cyral_Drive> this confused me too
[2:24:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> those are probably grabable ledges
[2:24:42] <alextrebeken> wall grab?
[2:24:43] <Unicyclemonkey> Grab?
[2:24:47] <Futurecity10> @PlagueOfGripes its a grab
[2:24:51] <jbournehd> grab
[2:24:53] <darkbotle> float
[2:24:58] <mortelkilll> if yo udont figure it out im beating you up kid
[2:25:03] <darkbotle> udr your lightsaber as a helicopter
[2:25:03] <deadstrat> Is his master dead?
[2:25:04] <guardian_collin> Jedi are worse than Sith
[2:25:08] <%Samex_Comex> Send in the Sentinels
[2:25:09] <+JackalKing> This looks like the killbox from that episode of clone wars
[2:25:33] <Lenmutt> is the master doing that with force or is it like magnets?
[2:25:34] <BinaryBetrayer> Remember when they put Anakin and Luke through an Aperture Science test room?
[2:25:37] <+PerrinIsDead> Oh hey its skullface as ajedi
[2:25:38] <darkbotle> those are some dangerous moving parts right there and not a single warning sign in sight...
[2:25:38] <deadstrat> Because I feel him being Evil and coming back later
[2:25:40] <ThirdPersonPhil> jedi booster pads
[2:25:43] <DragonBornKing> anyone see the fallen order sonic vid
[2:25:51] <+HorribleHog> Ikr? Are these blocks being controlled by the force, or what?
[2:25:52] <alextrebeken> *space assassins
[2:26:02] <Seatherten> i bet you can just go out of bounds
[2:26:03] <kiwicoffin> The lack of a reverse jump is ridiculous
[2:26:05] <Seatherten> right there
[2:26:20] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> More Jedi kids = more taxes for magic jungle gyms.
[2:26:21] <rytisone> laser blanks?
[2:26:26] <TechGFennec> No
[2:26:31] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Probably set to stun.
[2:26:34] <+BuriasDempsey> blasters can be set to stun
[2:26:34] <BinaryBetrayer> If it was the real republic they would've let that clone eat blaster and die
[2:26:35] <mortelkilll> man this guy huge
[2:26:40] <+HorribleHog> Remember when aliens used to speak in alien tongues?
[2:26:41] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh he is a bat
[2:26:42] <FairOnFire> cheap shot Commander! heheheh (as he kills him with reflected bolts)
[2:26:43] <+PerrinIsDead> Holy shit
[2:26:47] <darkbotle> big struggles
[2:26:48] <TechGFennec> Children are inmune to blater fire
[2:26:49] <ThirdPersonPhil> there is probably no tech on that room, its just some intern jedi doing all the floating boxes
[2:26:50] <+BuriasDempsey> ruh roh
[2:26:57] <jbournehd> Execute order 6
[2:27:01] <StarlitStunner> Lesaat
[2:27:02] <deadstrat> Oh shit
[2:27:03] <Lenmutt> why someone that big use a doublebladed lightsaber?
[2:27:04] <guardian_collin> I wonder what Order 65 is
[2:27:07] <TardigradeRex> Order 69
[2:27:08] <SuperVaderMan> Oh no, not hi-5 guy, he gave me a hi-5
[2:27:15] <guardian_collin> probably a Bacon Cheeseburger with Large Fries and a Dr.Pepper
[2:27:17] <FairOnFire> is he a vampire bat?
[2:27:21] <+PerrinIsDead> Fuck Order 66 is so dumb
[2:27:24] <+HorribleHog> I predict one of the clones will say "sorry, kid"
[2:27:28] <darkbotle> so, a billion clone troopers all know about this order thing and nobody leaked a thing?
[2:27:29] <%Samex_Comex> It's Panthro!
[2:27:33] <Skeletonmanners> hes anime
[2:27:34] <Wynzler> Maybe not for his species
[2:27:35] <PulverKong> why do all young padawans have the Anakin haircut
[2:27:39] <laserbeaming> He has Disney Eyes
[2:27:40] <guardian_collin> problem with O66 is that it had to exist
[2:27:40] <BinaryBetrayer> Shouldn't the kid be a distraction so the bigger stronger better trained Jedi can survive and be more useful?
[2:27:41] <Wynzler> Maybe they're small for his species
[2:27:42] <DragonBornKing> everyone has bug eyes in this game
[2:27:50] <Lenmutt> i had a feeling this was coming since you fist bumped a clone trooper
[2:27:51] <Wynzler> And maybe he's self-conscious about it
[2:27:52] <PulverKong> star wars fashion
[2:27:53] <ThirdPersonPhil> i know people love star wars to look like shitty puppets... but that guy face looks too bad
[2:27:54] <jbournehd> This tail makes him look like such a pussy
[2:28:08] <+PerrinIsDead> Didnt Rex and Cody resist order 66?
[2:28:09] <laserbeaming> I DEMAND MURDER
[2:28:10] <$SilverRoddo> This is the way, though.
[2:28:12] <+HorribleHog> May the Force be with you? Why not may God be with you -- like in the movie!
[2:28:13] <Zebroneath> No fun allowed!
[2:28:16] <mortelkilll> the hairtail is a punishment for being a dweeb padawan
[2:28:18] <TechGFennec> "I just want to go oon a rampage"
[2:28:19] <jbournehd> Kill them all Peter
[2:28:23] <jbournehd> They deserved it
[2:28:51] <TardigradeRex> LUL
[2:28:51] <deadstrat> what
[2:28:52] <TechGFennec> The fuck?
[2:28:59] <jbournehd> oh no muh immersion
[2:28:59] <BinaryBetrayer> Remember when they retconned Order 66 to be some evil brainwashing chip inside every clone's brain instead of them just being mass produced to obey unquestioningly?
[2:29:08] <laserbeaming> If he's like 13-15 now, is he in his mid to late 30s in the game?
[2:29:14] <darkbotle> makes much more sense...
[2:29:28] <Lenmutt> brain implants
[2:29:30] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Pretty sure it was a sleeper-agent type thing.
[2:29:33] <laserbeaming> Order 66 kinda makes no sense
[2:29:35] <deadstrat> It baffled me it worked
[2:29:37] <rytisone> Order 66: kill all jedi when Palpatine says so
[2:29:40] <StarlitStunner> Brain chips
[2:29:41] <+HorribleHog> I mean clone programming... I could see it! However the whole clone army plotline is stupid anyway
[2:29:43] <Darkreg70> OH SHIT PLAUGE STREAM PogChamp HahaGoose
[2:29:44] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Shoot to kill? As opposed to what they were doing before?
[2:29:44] <LordSDB> Order 66 doesn't make sense to me, Was order 66 a mass mind control to the clones?
[2:29:46] <TechGFennec> Star Wars lore makes no sense
[2:29:48] <+HorribleHog> Or at the least handled really poorly
[2:29:51] <mortelkilll> you see it right here
[2:29:55] <BinaryBetrayer> Brain Chips, bypasses Jedi detectiong or some shit.
[2:29:56] <Lenmutt> organic brain chips put into clones from embryo stages
[2:29:56] <mortelkilll> the guy knw he was gonan get attacked
[2:29:57] <kiwicoffin> I would assume only surrounded Jedi could be overwhelmed
[2:30:00] <alextrebeken> isnt it more of a spider sense
[2:30:03] <Zebroneath> They would still sense the disturbance immediatly
[2:30:08] <jbournehd> So now his blade can cut through anything
[2:30:08] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes BUT THE DARK SIDE, THOUGH
[2:30:08] <+PerrinIsDead> But didnt Com. Rex not obey the order?
[2:30:08] <darkbotle> pssshh, no coplaints, just dreams now
[2:30:10] <LordSDB> Can anyone in chat explain it to me?
[2:30:11] <TechGFennec> What are those tubes?
[2:30:11] <Wynzler> Palpatine put in the order for the clones to be made, so they were made to fit his needs
[2:30:19] <StarlitStunner> Sith temple under the Jedi temple, it’s dumb
[2:30:23] <laserbeaming> At least they sent Anakin to slay the most dangerous of the Jedi: the 6 year old children
[2:30:24] <+HorribleHog> Somehow the guys who breed the clones know how to instill commands
[2:30:26] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> How many of them died in the middle of battle?
[2:30:27] <jbournehd> force semen has made them do it
[2:30:33] <$SilverRoddo> mikelivePalpatine Execute Oodah, move the plot along.
[2:30:34] <Wynzler> So they automatically listen to any orders he gives
[2:30:36] <+HorribleHog> But remember when Yoda said the clones look different in the force?
[2:30:41] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I can see those biting it more easily.
[2:30:44] <+pyrojack6> like a cat yea
[2:30:45] <Cyral_Drive> true
[2:30:47] <TechGFennec> There was an alarm sound?
[2:30:47] <tanarath> Nah, Dark side = snowflakey and hard to sense.
[2:30:52] <Skeletonmanners> as described in the canon novel "Star Wars the Warsening", Darth Shitius used his fart powers to destroy 87% of the jedi
[2:30:53] <darkbotle> well, if youd read comic book 73 "the revenge of the order" you would totally understand this situation bro
[2:30:55] <+lethallunacyx> I was thinking baby elephant
[2:30:56] <DickChapyGaming> some jedi did get away, but it was still way too effective for how little of a plan it was
[2:30:56] <BinaryBetrayer> Remember when Sheev became a force ghost and fucked Anakin's mom and made her force pregnant?
[2:30:57] <%hgtarras> I always hated the younling robes
[2:31:05] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> The small padawan protonLOL
[2:31:07] <+JackalKing> Most Jedi were constantly surrounded by hundreds of clones. The clones would have always been close by because the jedi were military leaders. Even if the Jedi had a 5 minute warning to prepare, few of them would have been in any position to save themselves
[2:31:09] <Lenmutt> i gotta head out, enjoy force rock throw later
[2:31:10] <kiwicoffin> Man you suck
[2:31:13] <%Samex_Comex> Fuck your baby hands
[2:31:14] <+HorribleHog> how did they miss?
[2:31:16] <StarlitStunner> stripStab stripFear
[2:31:26] <Skeletonmanners> is it Patrick Seitz as alien man?
[2:31:29] <SuperVaderMan> No fun allowed in the video game
[2:31:29] <Skeletonmanners> sounds like him
[2:31:32] <jbournehd> This weapon is your life
[2:31:34] <TardigradeRex> No more weeapons, this is where it turns into a horror survival game.
[2:31:35] <+HorribleHog> they took multiple shots at you
[2:31:35] <+Vestillion> use the force you goon! you could just instantly pull it back up to you!
[2:31:47] <mortelkilll> you cant let this child kill people, even trough hes gonna mow down thousands in a few years
[2:31:49] <BinaryBetrayer> 2tall for a regular lightsaber
[2:31:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> youd dad looks angry at you for loosing the lightsaber
[2:31:58] <Teyaric> Goes to show what a MAD MONK order the Jedi were if that's his response, tho
[2:32:03] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Pong Krell had a quadruple bladed one.
[2:32:09] <+JackalKing> Plenty of Jedi used them. There is one in Clone Wars that uses two. Then again he has four arms.
[2:32:10] <+PerrinIsDead> Nah in KOTOR they were used
[2:32:16] <$SilverRoddo> You are a childs, childrens don’t kill, in this child’s story.
[2:32:45] <StarlitStunner> Saber staves and pikes were used all the time by temple guards and librarians
[2:32:48] <PulverKong> except if you're a robot during Order 66..
[2:32:48] <+HorribleHog> Remember when Darth Maul's double-lightsaber was presented shocking to the audience, but apparently jedi used double-bladeds all the time!
[2:32:55] <+pyrojack6> @JackalKing i remember that dude, his sabers were also kinda nunchucks
[2:33:08] <BinaryBetrayer> Maybe it's the glowing button
[2:33:08] <SquigglyLizard> LUL
[2:33:10] <Zebroneath> That looked lame
[2:33:10] <+HorribleHog> It looks way too short for him
[2:33:11] <mortelkilll> what the heck is that?
[2:33:12] <ThirdPersonPhil> Man... this is fucking raw mocap
[2:33:17] <darkbotle> that looked really dumb
[2:33:18] <jbournehd> what
[2:33:19] <PulverKong> i feel bad for stormtroopers
[2:33:20] <+GraceTBM> is this a fucking live action star wars cutscene
[2:33:23] <+SoleilAstier> that looked like shit
[2:33:24] <Cyral_Drive> That looked super dumb
[2:33:24] <+jepupu> Legendary stormtrooper accuracy
[2:33:25] <Unicyclemonkey> Sooo cool
[2:33:27] <%Samex_Comex> Holy shit Panthro
[2:33:30] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> What was that trooper doing? His best.
[2:33:31] <SuperVaderMan> Wow look how intense this situation is, as he casually just walks through LUL
[2:33:31] <Teyaric> This man gave zero fucks
[2:33:34] <deadstrat> I thought this was supposed to be a dramatic scene
[2:33:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Holy shit Panthro
[2:33:39] <kiwicoffin> That looked like a Universal Studios stage play
[2:33:41] <PulverKong> We just needed the last guy bonking his head in the doorway
[2:33:44] <deadstrat> not a farce
[2:33:45] <Twad_Feu> showing off competent opposition is so dam rare
[2:33:47] <TechGFennec> Maybe he hates flies
[2:34:07] <+JackalKing> Order 66 low key fried the clone's brains and made their aim really bad. That is how we got stormtroopers
[2:34:09] <mortelkilll> you little shit
[2:34:12] <BinaryBetrayer> Oh no, cutscenes, the weakness of any Jeid
[2:34:13] <+HorribleHog> how are they not just being riddled
[2:34:14] <Cyral_Drive> za warudo
[2:34:16] <SuperVaderMan> WOW that looked bad
[2:34:23] <jbournehd> Jesus fuk
[2:34:24] <+BuriasDempsey> remember when clones were competent soldiers? I member
[2:34:24] <Wynzler> Did he phase them out of existence?
[2:34:25] <jbournehd> this game
[2:34:27] <+ratchetex> that looked so bad
[2:34:28] <+ConLin_Arts_> and now he becomes the Joker
[2:34:29] <+Bearzone> wtf was that
[2:34:31] <PulverKong> KISS HIM YOU FOOL
[2:34:32] <+GraceTBM> he made them staticy
[2:34:44] <mortelkilll> the signal that never will come
[2:34:46] <kiwicoffin> I killed everyone of those dudes padawan. Be cool
[2:34:47] <PulverKong> "I'M FEELING COLD...SO COLD..HOLD ME"
[2:34:49] <Wynzler> He made us, the audience, unable to focus on their polygons
[2:34:55] <Cyral_Drive> yes
[2:34:56] <jbournehd> The sand
[2:34:57] <darkbotle> trust no one, not even your shelf
[2:34:58] <Teyaric> Was sheev so crazy for treating them like al quaeda?
[2:34:59] <jbournehd> its everywhere
[2:35:00] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes This is why I like the OT, powers aren't overblown.
[2:35:03] <+ratchetex> what
[2:35:07] <+Kawaii_Joker> Sexy Jaro Tapal fanart when?
[2:35:13] <DragonBornKing> REEEEEEEEEEE
[2:35:14] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[2:35:14] <+ratchetex> why did it explode?
[2:35:15] <PulverKong> that face tho
[2:35:17] <deadstrat> hahhaaha
[2:35:18] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:35:20] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[2:35:20] <+GraceTBM> that was awful
[2:35:23] <+Bearzone> autistic scream
[2:35:24] <Tiny_Axolotl> hate his scream
[2:35:27] <BinaryBetrayer> Reeeeee
[2:35:27] <ahegotrigger> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[2:35:32] <tanarath> The bes
[2:35:32] <DickChapyGaming> it is genuinely charming and kinda cool seeing a new game using both Clone Wars and Galactic Empire tech and ships
[2:35:32] <rytisone> they sure will
[2:35:34] <StarlitStunner> stripAchoo
[2:35:39] <%Samex_Comex> Oh shit!
[2:35:42] <+pyrojack6> we need you emotionless child soldier
[2:35:44] <ahegotrigger> oh god not again
[2:35:47] <tanarath> EA really pulling out the stops!
[2:35:47] <Lelfro> His angst will lead to good! Not bad
[2:35:55] <$SilverRoddo> Now he is motivated?
[2:35:56] <Wynzler> Dammit I hate that the orange is preorder exclusive
[2:35:59] <ahegotrigger> that was the correct response
[2:36:07] <BinaryBetrayer> Force pull and stab him
[2:36:08] <SuperVaderMan> ok, bye master :)
[2:36:09] <jbournehd> LOL that spin
[2:36:11] <Wynzler> It's the best color for mcgingerfuck
[2:36:15] <PulverKong> we can just stand here and stare for as long as you want
[2:36:25] <+HorribleHog> So glad you're playing this Eli LUL
[2:36:27] <Triblade1992> >Game wants you attack him first.
[2:36:32] <Triblade1992> Luke would be ashamed of that
[2:36:40] <guardian_collin> so saber colors dont actaully matter right?
[2:36:45] <DragonBornKing> i really liked the unstable crystals form force unleashed
[2:36:46] <+HorribleHog> laeKEK
[2:36:48] <BinaryBetrayer> This is so dumb looking.
[2:36:59] <darkbotle> half hearted swings
[2:37:03] <rytisone> look at his legs just spinning in place
[2:37:15] <StarlitStunner> brucegCringe
[2:37:17] <jbournehd> THERE'S NO HIGH GROUND IN THIS ROON
[2:37:24] <tanarath> @guardian_collin rule of cool
[2:37:25] <PulverKong> his legs kept spinning
[2:37:28] <ahegotrigger> put it in deeper apprentice
[2:37:32] <Cyral_Drive> he agrees
[2:37:33] <mortelkilll> you' re an asshole!
[2:37:34] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:37:40] <Triblade1992> LUL
[2:37:40] <darkbotle> samuel l jackson is really strong in that alien jedi
[2:37:41] <Tiny_Axolotl> his face
[2:37:42] <$SilverRoddo> He is the high ground. Kappa
[2:37:46] <BinaryBetrayer> The darth mauls are staring from afar and laughing
[2:37:47] <Teyaric> the dark side has like ONE move in its book.
[2:37:48] <Lelfro> death grip
[2:37:48] <rosemon5001> no bully space rick astley
[2:37:48] <rytisone> you broke it, idiot
[2:37:49] <+Bearzone> bruh
[2:37:50] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[2:37:53] <SuperVaderMan> He squeezed his lightsaber so hard he broke it? And his hands are fine? LUL
[2:37:54] <ahegotrigger> no more beam sword
[2:37:56] <tanarath> Colors are purely differentiation
[2:38:01] <guardian_collin> I want a bright pink Saber
[2:38:01] <darkbotle> oh no the magic space crystal :(((
[2:38:03] <Triblade1992> As long as it's red
[2:38:04] <StarlitStunner> x0periRage
[2:38:07] <%Samex_Comex> Mmm grape
[2:38:08] <TechGFennec> The crystal shattered? With what? angst?
[2:38:08] <ahegotrigger> goddamnit
[2:38:16] <kiwicoffin> Just use the force
[2:38:17] <+TheStarvingGood> ye
[2:38:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> you tough you were gonna get a force power. But then your dad broke your lightsaber
[2:38:21] <BinaryBetrayer> That you did, plague.
[2:38:26] <jbournehd> It's..... nothing
[2:38:26] <ahegotrigger> I mean what can you do without a lightsaber
[2:38:28] <+Vestillion> Black lightsaber when?
[2:38:32] <laserbeaming> sometimes you just need a good freakout
[2:38:40] <guardian_collin> isnt black the absense of light?
[2:38:44] <BinaryBetrayer> I bet there's a Black Lightsaber somewhere in Star Wars
[2:38:45] <RothurThePaladin> Hey plague and chat.
[2:38:48] <%Violated_Muffins> F=ma. light has no mass. lightsaber swings have no force. but jedi use the force? TOO MANY QUESTIONS!!!!
[2:38:53] <SuperVaderMan> The cutscenes were laughable, but it's a step forward LUL
[2:38:55] <+ratchetex> at least it had a point yeah
[2:38:57] <jbournehd> time for some more endless meaningless action
[2:39:01] <Triblade1992> Again, this is why I like Jojo and Bleach. Very character driven action
[2:39:05] <darkbotle> get in frared or ultra violt lightsaber, nobody could see your blade
[2:39:06] <BinaryBetrayer> Just to suffer
[2:39:08] <Beefchief33> @BinaryBetrayer Better, there is a DARK saber
[2:39:10] <Teyaric> Dark Souls + Uncharted is a weird result.
[2:39:10] <Wynzler> Please stop praising Bleach
[2:39:12] <darkbotle> *infrared
[2:39:15] <Futurecity10> You were supposed to get a vision for the Vanu
[2:39:15] <mortelkilll> i dont
[2:39:16] <deadstrat> no
[2:39:17] <ahegotrigger> we wanted a compass
[2:39:18] <Cyral_Drive> find the macguffin
[2:39:19] <LordSDB> Night sister?
[2:39:21] <rytisone> to find an answer
[2:39:21] <ahegotrigger> or something
[2:39:22] <SuperVaderMan> I think hologram man said to come here
[2:39:25] <kiwicoffin> You came here because you used the force to save Prauf in front of a spy droid
[2:39:27] <laserbeaming> We came here to Seek Souls?
[2:39:29] <DragonBornKing> Wooo...
[2:39:31] <+Bearzone> unlock powers?
[2:39:32] <lethallylactic> wooo
[2:39:33] <jbournehd> Wooooo..
[2:39:44] <PulverKong> @Violated_Muffins how do you even stop the light in the lightsaber from going forever? so many question
[2:39:47] <ahegotrigger> yes
[2:39:48] <mortelkilll> where the fuck is that list
[2:39:49] <deadstrat> oh right
[2:39:50] <+Bearzone> Wait
[2:39:55] <Triblade1992> Maybe destroy it?
[2:39:59] <BinaryBetrayer> So you're trafficking in child Psykers
[2:40:00] <+Bearzone> A LIST?
[2:40:01] <ahegotrigger> the list on the vault on the swamp plaent
[2:40:04] <TheWe4pon> Yay kidnapping!
[2:40:12] <darkbotle> that's messed up yo
[2:40:17] <ahegotrigger> were finding the keys to open the vault right now
[2:40:31] <kiwicoffin> For some reason there are multiple keys
[2:40:40] <%Violated_Muffins> @PulverKong I dont want to think about it hahah! ill just chalk it up to space wizardry
[2:40:59] <Futurecity10> What? No, you've got the entire plot wrong
[2:41:07] <ahegotrigger> the multiple keys makes sense but 2 of them were right next to each other on the same planet
[2:41:10] <kiwicoffin> Trilla already took the other one
[2:41:21] <laserbeaming> So... We need Souls to Kindle the First Flame right?
[2:41:23] <PulverKong> try pointing a laser, it won't stop until it hits a solid object. but the light saber doesn't have a "ceiling"
[2:41:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:41:36] <PulverKong> space magic
[2:41:37] <jbees7> its like a usb stick with info, thats the artifact
[2:41:40] <+FadingEmber> the game's story feels a bit rushed
[2:41:50] <Triblade1992> It's sad that writers don't understand the difference between McGuffin and Plot Coupon. If they actually gave explanations for what you were looking for, then it would be a Plot Coupon
[2:41:52] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes I think you need to remember something. this is EA. This is a masterpiece for them.
[2:41:53] <Futurecity10> The old dude hid the holocron in the first zeffo temple, but you have to journey to the temples to prove your worth
[2:41:59] <+Bearzone> at least it look cool
[2:42:01] <ahegotrigger> I love all the dathomir chracters
[2:42:01] <Wynzler> Something about the mirrors or some shit in the lightsaber is what makes the lightsaber have a 'point'
[2:42:11] <darkbotle> sex offender!
[2:42:11] <jbournehd> who
[2:42:17] <guardian_collin> its Obi Wan Kinobi!
[2:42:22] <Triblade1992> Jorus C'Boath?
[2:42:26] <Lelfro> "You and I"
[2:42:28] <%Samex_Comex> Look at my chest
[2:42:32] <+Bearzone> he just starts masterbating in front of you lol
[2:42:33] <mortelkilll> super stable
[2:42:38] <PulverKong> he doesn't look like the story badguy at all
[2:42:42] <+shibbymatt> his nipples are tiny
[2:42:43] <+BuriasDempsey> He seems completely fine and perfectly sane
[2:42:45] <laserbeaming> He just likes running topless around ruins
[2:42:45] <darkbotle> is this kingdom hearts now?
[2:42:48] <SuperVaderMan> I'm sure those ritualistic scars on his chest are nothing, he seems like he's on the level
[2:42:50] <TechGFennec> Light sabers are canonically made out of plasma held toghther with the force
[2:42:51] <PulverKong> he has very small nipples
[2:42:53] <Wynzler> Holy shit he's Xehanort
[2:42:54] <BinaryBetrayer> Time to kill another jedi
[2:43:03] <cap_bon> when does next product come out by the way I've not kept track
[2:43:06] <darkbotle> kill him when he talks about organization 13
[2:43:08] <jbournehd> SAVAGES
[2:43:11] <guardian_collin> Sith>Jedi
[2:43:28] <ahegotrigger> the Jedi tried to run a government
[2:43:30] <laserbeaming> I kind of see his point
[2:43:34] <PulverKong> yeah you're not a mindless automaton therefore you are bad person
[2:43:34] <$SilverRoddo> Savages! Are they even human?!
[2:43:38] <laserbeaming> kind of?
[2:43:45] <ahegotrigger> how did they not try to seize power
[2:43:54] <Wynzler> C'mon plague, you know better
[2:44:03] <kiwicoffin> He won't give you his saber so I don't think you fight
[2:44:04] <mortelkilll> even if he doesnt kill us now, he ll try later
[2:44:08] <SuperVaderMan> Be honest with yourself plague, you know better about this game by now
[2:44:09] <PulverKong> oo the sexy lady
[2:44:13] <darkbotle> yes half naked hobo man, I will join your "family"
[2:44:15] <laserbeaming> It's Lady Quan Chi!
[2:44:16] <jbournehd> He has a literal shoot mark on his chest, Plague
[2:44:17] <cap_bon> Imagine talking your problems out instead of hitting it with laser sword
[2:44:17] <deadstrat> She can teleport
[2:44:27] <guardian_collin> @darkbotle this is him from the future when he took over a kid's body and there are 12 more of him running around\
[2:44:28] <Triblade1992> Well you can still have crazy Jedi like Jorus where you do have Luke talk with him several times and only have them fight in the end
[2:44:29] <+Bearzone> Quan chi got wierd
[2:44:37] <tanarath> Plague, it's EA. You know the truth.
[2:44:40] <$SilverRoddo> Batman’s Anarchy?
[2:44:48] <kiwicoffin> You mad. Not me though
[2:44:52] <PulverKong> i bet she looks hot without those robes
[2:44:56] <geekjacob> does she not know the droid army killed the knight sister?
[2:44:58] <BinaryBetrayer> Why is she the only person on this planet with actual clothes?
[2:44:59] <+Bearzone> the who?
[2:45:03] <Wynzler> I actually really like Merrin
[2:45:06] <+WaywardSera> what are these testes hanging around?
[2:45:14] <SuperVaderMan> Look, she's casting a Force spell
[2:45:15] <+WaywardSera> space magic!
[2:45:15] <Wynzler> She has some depth to her character
[2:45:16] <lethallylactic> Kreygasm
[2:45:16] <GarrisonWaifu> Are we sure this isnt Destiny 2?
[2:45:16] <ahegotrigger> because shes important @BinaryBetrayer
[2:45:19] <PulverKong> uh oh time to leave
[2:45:19] <+Vestillion> look, magic!
[2:45:21] <SquigglyLizard> magic LUL
[2:45:24] <deadstrat> This is jus necromancy
[2:45:24] <darkbotle> space magic, literally space magic
[2:45:25] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh
[2:45:25] <jbournehd> Quan Chi has returned
[2:45:26] <Triblade1992> Jedi by association
[2:45:26] <DragonBornKing> "time to go" stand there
[2:45:27] <kiwicoffin> She's a bigot
[2:45:27] <rytisone> zombies
[2:45:28] <+FadingEmber> Zombies!!!
[2:45:34] <FairOnFire> why are necromantic powers always green
[2:45:34] <+Bearzone> or real its Quan chi
[2:45:36] <jbournehd> What is this power btw
[2:45:38] <lethallylactic> zombambos
[2:45:41] <PulverKong> why do YOU have to learn? just walk to your ship and fly away man
[2:45:43] <jbournehd> Ooohhh, sexy
[2:45:46] <lethallylactic> LUL
[2:45:49] <lethallylactic> Those animations
[2:45:50] <Cyral_Drive> that sounded like some chat spam pasta
[2:45:51] <BinaryBetrayer> Nice camera angle to start the action with
[2:45:52] <darkbotle> are those force zombies?
[2:45:52] <jbournehd> lel
[2:45:56] <mortelkilll> yes
[2:46:01] <+HorribleHog> it's those guys from Doom!
[2:46:03] <PulverKong> i like how the quest is "get the fuck outta dodge"
[2:46:03] <deadstrat> Now you know why force push kills them
[2:46:05] <+BuriasDempsey> yes force zombies are athing
[2:46:20] <Tiny_Axolotl> i like the hobo
[2:46:40] <+Bearzone> star wars has zombies?
[2:46:43] <ahegotrigger> it wants you to go back to the ship
[2:46:46] <kiwicoffin> That hobo just dipped
[2:46:50] <geekjacob> ratgoul
[2:46:52] <Triblade1992> Stormtrooper Zombies
[2:46:55] <+SoleilAstier> Red Harvest
[2:47:01] <PulverKong> @darkbotle there is a whole book about the. It's called Death Troopers
[2:47:02] <Teyaric> It gets boiled down to PE-Mitochondria real fast, doesnt it?
[2:47:07] <tanarath> @bearzone Star Wars is Science Fantasy
[2:47:08] <rytisone> space biohazard
[2:47:15] <Triblade1992> Yeah, Stormtrooper zombies are hilarious
[2:47:17] <+SoleilAstier> YES IT DOES
[2:47:18] <%Samex_Comex> Zombie stories being bad
[2:47:21] <laserbeaming> Plague, are you in a Quest for the worst Star Wars EU content?
[2:47:22] <tanarath> Of course it has them
[2:47:27] <SinnerBeta> how about the zombie star wars story?
[2:47:28] <+SoleilAstier> its sucks so bad its funny @PlagueOfGripes
[2:47:28] <jbournehd> Dab on those force zombies
[2:47:29] <SuperVaderMan> there's some zombie stuff that's ok, like rakghouls, but the actual 'zombie' zombie stuff is real bad
[2:47:40] <$pennykettle_> I'm totally outside of star wars. is the force just a force of nature like gravity, or does it have a will and sort of goals
[2:47:44] <+Bearzone> @tanarath I guess. seems kinda wild tbh
[2:47:52] <PulverKong> in Death Troopers, some space dude runs across a derelict star destroyer..which happens to be full of stormtrooper zombies
[2:47:54] <tanarath> @plagueofgripes Have you heard the legend of Trioculous?
[2:48:03] <PulverKong> and han solo and chewie is in the prison cells
[2:48:03] <jbournehd> this is hillarious
[2:48:05] <mortelkilll> its unclear if the force has goals
[2:48:06] <Wynzler> Jumping requires space magic
[2:48:10] <mortelkilll> seem liek a very neuitral force
[2:48:12] <rytisone> zombies are motivated enough
[2:48:14] <Wynzler> The nightbrothers dont have any of that, just their weapons
[2:48:14] <lethallylactic> Then there are the Genosian zombies with the parasite brain worms
[2:48:20] <Wynzler> For *some* reasno
[2:48:26] <+WaywardSera> They look like the animators took an early lunch when they got to them and hoped making them move really really fast would compensate
[2:48:32] <ThirdPersonPhil> i believe this was supposed to be a high octane escape sequence
[2:48:49] <Triblade1992> oh yeah!
[2:48:50] <ahegotrigger> you did it Plague
[2:49:12] <+SoleilAstier> @PlagueOfGripes i hade to laugh it when i read it it was the only way to finish it. Fucking force zombies made by talking force plant
[2:49:14] <kiwicoffin> Cal really fucked this up
[2:49:15] <ahegotrigger> when you cant handle your girlfriends foreplay
[2:49:22] <PulverKong> Did you know that Drit means Shit in Norwegian? So Greez Dritus is literally Greez Shitus
[2:49:22] <Triblade1992> GEE I WONDER WHO IT IS
[2:49:23] <+BuriasDempsey> to be fair, zombies are a good reason to leave a place
[2:49:23] <SinnerBeta> "zombies? shit, we're out kid"
[2:49:28] <geekjacob> and now zombie girlfriends are after me
[2:49:46] <TardigradeRex> Raising the dead isn't even close to the worst a girlfriend will do for attention.
[2:49:49] <PulverKong> they all float
[2:49:50] <jbournehd> Looney Tunes Star Wars
[2:49:56] <ahegotrigger> the fact that you kill them in one force push is hilarious
[2:49:57] <Wynzler> I love that their bodies lose the will to carry on after the slightest push
[2:50:10] <TechGFennec> We all float in the physics engine
[2:50:17] <+SoleilAstier> Yes the plant was bad
[2:50:18] <Lelfro> So someone will have to drag those corpses back into the nutsacks?
[2:50:20] <kiwicoffin> They accelerate faster then their models can mesh to the terrain
[2:50:34] <+Bearzone> like gravemind from halo?
[2:50:40] <PulverKong> Death Troopers is a good read. It just has a guy stumbling over a derelict Star Destroyer where the entire crew of tens of thousands are zombies
[2:50:40] <$SilverRoddo> Would y’all rather have a harem of undead Nightsisters, or kiss Cal?
[2:50:46] <cap_bon> why was that last enemy even there
[2:50:48] <deadstrat> Is this supposed to be funnyß
[2:50:52] <Triblade1992> Uh oh. One of them snuck in
[2:50:56] <ThirdPersonPhil> why were you here anyway?
[2:51:03] <jbournehd> her eyes are a bit too large
[2:51:04] <PulverKong> and Han Solo and Chewie is in it
[2:51:04] <laserbeaming> Isn't Star Wars as a setting whatever a particular writer wants it to be at the moment?
[2:51:05] <TardigradeRex> Will you fight her with a powerloader and blow her out an airlock?
[2:51:06] <ahegotrigger> this is supposed to be a bit funny
[2:51:12] <nmaten> he did it for the symbolism
[2:51:14] <TheWe4pon> god every time her eyes
[2:51:24] <Wynzler> I hate her eyes
[2:51:27] <mortelkilll> if he was braver he would have died
[2:51:28] <Wynzler> I HATE THEM
[2:51:33] <Cowctus> She is actually horrifying
[2:51:34] <ahegotrigger> you needed that compass
[2:51:37] <PulverKong> Why is Debra Wilson always "rebel leader woman"
[2:51:37] <geekjacob> the bug eyes
[2:51:38] <Triblade1992> her eyes look wrong
[2:51:40] <+Vestillion> Deeply unsettling
[2:51:42] <Skeletonmanners> the person they based the model on doesnt have those eyes
[2:51:44] <darkbotle> her eyes are going to consume my soul in my nightmares...
[2:51:46] <ahegotrigger> Her eyes
[2:51:46] <BinaryBetrayer> Her rigging just mangled her face
[2:51:46] <guardian_collin> she looks like shes looking for crack
[2:51:47] <laserbeaming> How old is Cal?
[2:51:47] <lethallylactic> She's got the "Innsmouth Look".
[2:51:57] <PulverKong> Debra was "rebel leader woman" in The Division 2 aswell
[2:51:58] <SinnerBeta> she's a human/bug hybrid alien spiecies
[2:51:59] <kiwicoffin> Noo
[2:52:02] <Wynzler> Wait Collin that's racist
[2:52:05] <SuperVaderMan> What prompted this backstory dump? "Oh no I got my master killed" "welp, time for my backstory now, here I go"
[2:52:06] <+FadingEmber> Its a shame because the person she is model after is very pretty
[2:52:06] <+WaywardSera> even the women and the children
[2:52:07] <BinaryBetrayer> We're getting there
[2:52:10] <jbournehd> I hated them
[2:52:10] <TardigradeRex> Especially the younglings. LUL
[2:52:12] <Beefchief33> Not the younglings
[2:52:13] <ahegotrigger> even the women and the children
[2:52:13] <+WaywardSera> ESPECIALLY the women and the children
[2:52:14] <jbournehd> They're all animals
[2:52:16] <DragonBornKing> retarded space monks
[2:52:17] <Triblade1992> NOT JUST THE MEN, BUT THE WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN TOO!
[2:52:18] <mortelkilll> ginger mc fuck face looked at her like "the dark side? yo uare disgusting"
[2:52:19] <Unicyclemonkey> Especially the younglings
[2:52:21] <kiwicoffin> ResidentSleeper
[2:52:23] <+bitstorm_> younglings lol, it is never not ridiculous
[2:52:29] <geekjacob> jedi are kinda lame
[2:52:29] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[2:52:30] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Oh my god, she really does look like she's from Innsmouth.
[2:52:31] <BinaryBetrayer> This is such a movie thing. "I am having angst" responded by "Here is my even angstier backstory, now stop being angst."
[2:52:33] <laserbeaming> HOPEE
[2:52:35] <PulverKong> Jedi are basically religious nutcases I understand why the sith eradicated them
[2:52:36] <Sapphire_Breeze> But Plague how can you kill them again if they are dead
[2:52:46] <SinnerBeta> @PlagueOfGripes sure, they will be replaced by the Skywalkers
[2:52:50] <cap_bon> Feelings are verboten
[2:52:51] <ahegotrigger> I feel like jedi philosophy is much more emo than they let on
[2:52:57] <darkbotle> are there sith who tap into the light side and just be calm for an hour to do taxes or whatever?
[2:52:58] <+WaywardSera> romanticized samurai crossed with puritan work ethic
[2:53:06] <lethallylactic> Oh god you can see her eyeballs wiggling in their sockets.
[2:53:07] <jbournehd> I cant look at her face
[2:53:07] <BinaryBetrayer> Nothing is a problem here, unless a zombie got in.
[2:53:09] <+Vestillion> Nun problems?
[2:53:15] <PulverKong> Jedi wasn't emo until Hayden Christensen
[2:53:16] <Triblade1992> They should just have the teachings of the Jedi and Sith put together and create something like the Skywalker Order or something
[2:53:17] <+SoleilAstier> HAHA
[2:53:17] <geekjacob> sooo off too illum?
[2:53:19] <laserbeaming> Her eyes are REALLY big
[2:53:21] <BinaryBetrayer> She should wear a robocop helmet
[2:53:24] <Wynzler> Like goddamn dinner plates in her head
[2:53:26] <ahegotrigger> fuck
[2:53:32] <$SilverRoddo> There’s always a Jedi Zombie arc?
[2:53:33] <SinnerBeta> force eyeballs
[2:53:36] <PulverKong> uh..hoth?
[2:53:37] <ThirdPersonPhil> lightsaber time?
[2:53:40] <LordSDB> New light saber plague
[2:53:40] <rytisone> to freeze to death
[2:53:43] <deadstrat> BECAUSE
[2:53:46] <ahegotrigger> she does look like one of those stress toys whose eyes bulge out
[2:53:48] <kiwicoffin> Because fuck you
[2:53:49] <Wynzler> Oh it's not-hoth
[2:53:49] <laserbeaming> Lightsaber Quest
[2:53:51] <zaitje> to fix your saber or something
[2:53:54] <+Bearzone> this the forge?
[2:53:55] <BinaryBetrayer> Reference within Referenecs
[2:53:55] <ahegotrigger> its the jedi order
[2:53:56] <SuperVaderMan> Some peoples' eyes do extrude outward like that, but this game makes peoples' eyeballs too big and exacerbates that
[2:54:00] <ahegotrigger> YOU GET A NEW COLOR
[2:54:00] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveFreeze jä!
[2:54:07] <tanarath> why does the ship arm rotate for no reason?
[2:54:07] <PulverKong> the dork side
[2:54:09] <jbournehd> These eyes are testing you right now
[2:54:11] <Wynzler> Half the planets in this game are new
[2:54:14] <darkbotle> join the dork side you nerd
[2:54:15] <cap_bon> Do you remember the thing
[2:54:16] <geekjacob> ilum is where jedi go to build and the kiber crystal
[2:54:18] <Cowctus> there had to be multiple people on team that went "this is fine" with her eyes
[2:54:24] <PulverKong> but you get fricking FORCE LIGHTNING
[2:54:24] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @lethallylactic I can't unsee it. She's definitely part fish-person.
[2:54:27] <Triblade1992> And that's why Luke Skywalker and Mara Jade were the ones with the right idea
[2:54:27] <PulverKong> why is that BAD
[2:54:32] <%Samex_Comex> Do you get to fight yetis
[2:54:33] <jbournehd> Dark Side is so cool though
[2:54:34] <deadstrat> This dialog is so hard to care about
[2:54:42] <beetbo2> It’s called “ilum”, is that new?
[2:54:43] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveTotalRecall what’s wrong with your eyes, pain causes it?
[2:54:44] <jbournehd> Just being a dick is so powerful
[2:54:44] <kiwicoffin> There's definitely no cutting yourself off from the force
[2:54:55] <geekjacob> yes
[2:54:57] <Triblade1992> yes
[2:55:05] <PulverKong> I loved how in KOTOR 2 you could just go the fuck dark side all the way
[2:55:08] <+Bearzone> yerrrrr
[2:55:27] <jbournehd> there more people die the better
[2:55:38] <BinaryBetrayer> And now wherever he goes, the book goes too
[2:55:43] <SinnerBeta> time travel, what a great addition to star wars
[2:55:45] <geekjacob> i am one with book
[2:55:46] <Triblade1992> KOTOR 1 and 2 along with Thrawn Trilogy had the right idea. It's just that the prequels broke the foundation of the franchise
[2:55:46] <PulverKong> consuming literature
[2:56:08] <kiwicoffin> So crazy it works
[2:56:23] <Wynzler> Time travel in star wars is almost as bad as time travel in naruto
[2:56:25] <cap_bon> man I hope rise of the sky walker has a crazy bad time travel plot
[2:56:25] <BinaryBetrayer> PREMIUM COLOR Lightsabers
[2:56:26] <darkbotle> just give it a new paintjob and it's good as new
[2:56:30] <PulverKong> when they started explaining The Force with Science in the prequels it all went to heck
[2:56:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Time travel is bad period
[2:56:44] <$SilverRoddo> It’s like sending a flesh nuke back in time to explode john conner.
[2:56:45] <Triblade1992> Exactly PulverKong
[2:56:45] <SuperVaderMan> why are there cables poking out, squeezing it really hard wouldn't do that
[2:56:46] <PulverKong> that's like explaining religion with science. you just don't try
[2:56:58] <SinnerBeta> I wonder if they have blue pills for that
[2:57:04] <PulverKong> suddenly jedi had power levels like in DBZ
[2:57:06] <mortelkilll> or they could just reveal that the force isnt real Kappa
[2:57:10] <jbournehd> Why are we here
[2:57:10] <beetbo2> Ilum
[2:57:12] <Triblade1992> "As you know" is the LAZIEST way of expositing information
[2:57:13] <ahegotrigger> time for a new crystal
[2:57:13] <Wynzler> I REMEMBER THAT GUY
[2:57:14] <jbournehd> Who are we really
[2:57:15] <Skeletonmanners> master recognizable name
[2:57:20] <PulverKong> "omg his midiclorian are oVER 9000!"
[2:57:21] <ThirdPersonPhil> you guys remember yoda?
[2:57:26] <+HorribleHog> "You look about a force level one"
[2:57:28] <$SilverRoddo> Lilim?
[2:57:32] <BinaryBetrayer> Remember in the novels when one of Leia's kids goes dark side because he cuts off some girls' arm during training because her lightsaber was too weak?
[2:57:36] <darkbotle> how can you make space wizzards boring?
[2:57:38] <Triblade1992> Luke, Mara Jade and Revan had t he right idea
[2:57:54] <Triblade1992> about how to use the Force and stuff
[2:58:02] <PulverKong> Yeah like..how do you STOP the light from just continuing forever
[2:58:21] <darkbotle> with space magic, duh! @PulverKong
[2:58:22] <PulverKong> why does it have an end point that is conveniently the size of a sqword
[2:58:29] <beetbo2> Plasma swords
[2:58:32] <Triblade1992> By basically taking away the mystery behind it @darkbotle
[2:58:36] <BinaryBetrayer> It'd be more feasible if it was some kind of plasma combustio- yes exactly.
[2:58:37] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Pretty sure they can adjust the length.
[2:58:56] <PulverKong> and why don't the jedi cut off all their limbs flailing that thing around
[2:58:58] <+HorribleHog> i'd much rather have the force amplify whatever emotions species affected by it have
[2:59:07] <beetbo2> Kinda like No more heroes beam katana
[2:59:11] <BinaryBetrayer> Force amplified ennui
[2:59:20] <+HorribleHog> that would at least explain some of the irrationality
[2:59:22] <kiwicoffin> I always thought a light chain and light sickle would be a more lethal weapon
[2:59:23] <beetbo2> Some form of plasma held in a magnetic field
[2:59:25] <laserbeaming> Banana
[2:59:42] <%Samex_Comex> Did you wash your hands?
[2:59:47] <TechGFennec> Force field
[2:59:53] <darkbotle> just build a gun that shoots tiny lightsabers
[2:59:56] <SinnerBeta> guide to jedi and sith or something like that?
[3:00:02] <BinaryBetrayer> Doesn't this place show up in Clone Wars?
[3:00:10] <PulverKong> in New Jack City the badguy had this awesome little laser whip attached to his finger..it would just cut people into pieces
[3:00:11] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Yes.
[3:00:13] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> It does.
[3:00:19] <PulverKong> but it had a physical end point
[3:00:20] <geekjacob> yeah and how they can bleed now so they can become red lightsabers
[3:00:21] <+jepupu> Whipped cream snow
[3:00:23] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveElsa
[3:00:31] <laserbeaming> C O N S U M E the snow
[3:00:56] <ahegotrigger> training
[3:01:01] <darkbotle> "younglings" I really hate that word
[3:01:01] <+bitstorm_> younglings
[3:01:05] <PulverKong> "the sith learned how to bleed the crystals turning them red"..yeap..explained
[3:01:10] <SinnerBeta> green never gets boring
[3:01:13] <+jepupu> I'm getting some Prince of Persia vibes from all that wall running
[3:01:23] <rytisone> windu used purple
[3:01:24] <laserbeaming> baaaad
[3:01:26] <+jorgamund> younglings' main job is to find new places to be killed
[3:01:27] <darkbotle> the red ones are the artificial ones for whatever reasons, wren't they?
[3:01:28] <mortelkilll> i wanna use a redlightsaber
[3:01:32] <+HorribleHog> better dead than red!
[3:01:37] <BinaryBetrayer> Wasn't the temple dynamited or some shit
[3:01:48] <+bitstorm_> windu had an amethyst crystal hence purple (or some logic)
[3:01:49] <kvassimoto> DrinkPurple B)
[3:01:50] <kiwicoffin> Let me explain the lore to BD
[3:01:51] <PulverKong> @rytisone that's because he's Samuel L. Fuckin Jackson
[3:02:22] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Pretty sure it was a special thing.
[3:02:24] <ECRead> I did like KOTOR's reasoning of red crystals
[3:02:24] <kvassimoto> @bitstorm_ The only black jedi in the galaxy
[3:02:25] <ahegotrigger> but since there were different colors did they mean anything
[3:02:28] <Gork_N_Mork> Didn't Sam Jackson just straight up ask for a purple one
[3:02:32] <Wynzler> Yes
[3:02:39] <BinaryBetrayer> In the novels it was about finding a special one. Then Han Solo's daughter cheats and cooks her own crystal in an oven like a meth addict.
[3:02:42] <+Comrade_Commando> i never understood how they said kyber crystals came from the strongest stars yet almost all crystals are found on jeddha or ilum
[3:02:42] <rytisone> jedi say the crystal calls you
[3:02:48] <Wynzler> So his nephew would be able to pick his out of a crowd in the cluttered fights in episode 2
[3:02:48] <+HorribleHog> ECRead yes
[3:03:12] <PulverKong> Khyber crystals are apparently alive
[3:03:14] <+bitstorm_> wasnt it because jedi controlled the kyber mines, hence they had to go synthetic?
[3:03:29] <Rosy_Joan> maybe synthetic crystals are just stupid easy to make
[3:03:32] <kiwicoffin> X number of sith started as jedi so why make a new saber
[3:03:34] <BinaryBetrayer> What if you died on the journey
[3:03:38] <+askalta> so do the different crystals have different physical attributes or is it just cosmetic anyway, i dont know shit about sw
[3:03:41] <PulverKong> so maybe synthetic crystals are less of a hassle to handle
[3:03:53] <SinnerBeta> sith staying in hiding used synthetic gems because they couldn't go to the planets with actual crystals without risking jedi noticing them, IIRC
[3:04:06] <+bitstorm_> ^
[3:04:11] <+HorribleHog> PulverKong That's good reasoning
[3:04:12] <PulverKong> why didn't the jedi just mine the crystals and bring them home to their base
[3:04:14] <beetbo2> Wasn’t my dream crystals a force enhancing thing before?
[3:04:17] <darkbotle> then why would anyone ever use the real crystals when the synth ones are so easy to come by?
[3:04:22] <beetbo2> In the novels?
[3:04:23] <lordkyzer2> it was to do with the jedi controlling the crystals right
[3:04:25] <$SilverRoddo> It’s like the use of Red and Blue imagery in Deathnote the animes, the Star Wars characters don’t really see coloration in lightsabers.
[3:04:39] <BinaryBetrayer> Becasue Jedis are hardcore traditionalists, Darkbotle
[3:04:46] <kiwicoffin> So a sith can sense jedi presence but not vice versa
[3:04:48] <Cyral_Drive> Oh there are worse Blizzards
[3:04:50] <geekjacob> force storm
[3:04:52] <rytisone> blizzard is the worst
[3:04:54] <ahegotrigger> you can still see so idk man
[3:04:54] <Habblewater> A space wizard did it
[3:05:04] <darkbotle> and that's why order 66 was a good thing @BinaryBetrayer
[3:05:08] <Wynzler> Untrue, Kiwicoffin
[3:05:14] <PulverKong> how nice that this planet is MADE for someone with claws on their hands
[3:05:20] <PulverKong> very convenient
[3:05:22] <BinaryBetrayer> It really was.
[3:05:27] <Wynzler> Like in Episode 4, Ben can sense Vader
[3:05:33] <Habblewater> So it's a mood ring now?
[3:05:34] <Habblewater> cool
[3:05:36] <Cyral_Drive> this climbable surface looks pleasant to me
[3:05:36] <mortelkilll> so lantern corp logic? i like it
[3:05:36] <SinnerBeta> I think there were some jedi with red lightsabers in some older lore, but they stopped using them when sith and other dark jedi started popping up and using red ones, I think this was the old republic era
[3:05:37] <dakehtc> Wow this is very tomb raider
[3:05:39] <PulverKong> damn look at the speed
[3:05:44] <%Samex_Comex> Like a mood ring?
[3:05:56] <cap_bon> having to make your crysttal special sounds more interesting
[3:06:02] <kvassimoto> cmonBruh
[3:06:03] <$SilverRoddo> Free Tatooine
[3:06:04] <darkbotle> murder every child with a red light saber, got it
[3:06:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> the black connection
[3:06:06] <kiwicoffin> @wynzler I guess I'm trying to understand the point of a fake crystal if it made no difference to other force users
[3:06:09] <PulverKong> he's Samuel Motherfuckin Jackson that's why he has a purple sabre
[3:06:14] <BinaryBetrayer> Remember a thousand years ago when everyone could carry portable shields and everyone had anti jedi vibrating swords?
[3:06:17] <ahegotrigger> they knew he was Samuel L jackson
[3:06:28] <TardigradeRex> Lightsaber profiling is real! LUL
[3:06:32] <+TheStarvingGood> Yeah he got a purple one cuz Samuel Jackson wanted a purple one.
[3:06:36] <mortelkilll> i like the mood ring personally
[3:06:37] <SinnerBeta> legends: mace just found a cool crystal, new canon: it's based on personality
[3:06:39] <BinaryBetrayer> That's perfect
[3:06:44] <BinaryBetrayer> Lightsaber Profiling
[3:06:44] <+FadingEmber> I mean Star Wars is stupid already...
[3:06:46] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[3:06:47] <ThirdPersonPhil> you people that tell me there is a star wars canon cant trick me, that shit does not exist
[3:06:47] <+HorribleHog> I don't like either LUL
[3:06:55] <+jorgamund> I think the difference was the explanation was explicit
[3:06:58] <PulverKong> Jackson was like "i want a motherfuckin purple saber". and he got one
[3:06:59] <ahegotrigger> Star wars is stupid with a cool setting
[3:07:04] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Pretty sure the force always guided jedi towards their crystals.
[3:07:15] <+lethallunacyx> Star Wars is so dumb and awesome
[3:07:18] <mortelkilll> just wish red wasnt only for evil people
[3:07:22] <ECRead> i like the dumb black one you can get in Force Unleashed
[3:07:22] <Habblewater> What would be the default? White beam if you're boring?
[3:07:24] <Triblade1992> I like the unique designs of crystals like Ben Solo's lightsaber.
[3:07:28] <Nebuchadnezzar_II> I made a red lightsaber goody two shoes jedi in kotor
[3:07:29] <SinnerBeta> if you're evil you can still have a blue or green in both old and new cannon - the color doesn't change after it's first established unless you do that sith ritual
[3:07:38] <beetbo2> I just wish it was dependent on the type of lightsaber you had, like No more heroes
[3:07:39] <ahegotrigger> yep
[3:07:41] <geekjacob> but this time the kiber crystal is "alive"
[3:07:45] <Rosy_Joan> according to wookiepedia Mace Windy has a purple lightsaber because his soul is purple
[3:07:48] <rytisone> gotta backtrack
[3:07:50] <+FadingEmber> Didn't she give you a saber?
[3:07:51] <SuperVaderMan> icicles are stronger than the force
[3:07:52] <BinaryBetrayer> Lightsaber, more like crutchsaber. Can't shatter ice without your toy
[3:07:53] <Triblade1992> The purple lightsaber was just because Samuel Jackson wanted to see where he was
[3:07:55] <VERDAXY> your not special
[3:07:58] <PulverKong> Maybe because to become a Jedi you have to become the same nindless, emotionless drone as every other jedi. That's why they all have the same colour
[3:07:59] <VERDAXY> smh
[3:08:01] <beetbo2> Where each color corresponds to a lightsabers heft, length, and type etc
[3:08:02] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you are on the jedi academy and you turn your first lightsaber on and its red, do you get expelled?
[3:08:04] <lordkyzer2> come back later jedi
[3:08:08] <cap_bon> damn this ice is to strong for the force
[3:08:09] <kiwicoffin> Use the force to punch stuff harder
[3:08:09] <darkbotle> gingers get orange lol
[3:08:16] <+HorribleHog> I'm pretty sure in one of the comics coarse sand boy had to corrupt his lightsaber by pouring his dark side into it
[3:08:18] <+bitstorm_> so does it mean using someone else's sabre that isn't aligned to you, it is less powerful?
[3:08:19] <darkbotle> even the crystals hate them
[3:08:19] <Triblade1992> Yellow was in the Library color
[3:08:22] <TardigradeRex> The Jedi that get pink lightsabers..
[3:08:23] <BinaryBetrayer> What if you're going through the Padawan course and on crystal 101 you get a red one?
[3:08:25] <kvassimoto> I wanted orange, it gave me lemon lime
[3:08:32] <ahegotrigger> no its down
[3:08:39] <jbees7> dow
[3:08:41] <mortelkilll> the mood ring thing would be a lot more interestign if sith had other colors than red
[3:08:48] <mortelkilll> and the lightsaber reflected their flaws
[3:08:50] <kiwicoffin> It's a very shitty ledge below you
[3:08:53] <SinnerBeta> jedi order, like any group, likes uniformity
[3:09:00] <VERDAXY> what about the black lightsaber ? was that still canon?
[3:09:01] <PulverKong> Is it like Ninjas? Your color represents you moral stake
[3:09:09] <Triblade1992> well that sounds better
[3:09:16] <BinaryBetrayer> Healing the saber
[3:09:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Just heal the saber
[3:09:20] <SuperVaderMan> is that a cowboy hat
[3:09:20] <darkbotle> healed the crystals....
[3:09:21] <beetbo2> Dark sabers tho @plagueofgripes
[3:09:26] <PulverKong> yeah cos Kyber crystals are actually live beings
[3:09:28] <Habblewater> Put a band aid on it
[3:09:29] <kvassimoto> Heat the saber
[3:09:33] <PulverKong> so they can be healed i guess
[3:09:34] <ahegotrigger> Pog
[3:09:47] <cap_bon> weeee
[3:09:48] <+bitstorm_> but does it mean a red sabre behaves differently to a blue one?
[3:09:48] <TheWe4pon> you think lightsaber dildos are a thing?
[3:09:52] <SinnerBeta> sith ritual makes the crystal "bleed", ahsoka ritual "heals" it or something like that
[3:10:08] <%Samex_Comex> My light saber is brown
[3:10:10] <lordkyzer2> do the crystals have memory
[3:10:17] <+HorribleHog> SinnerBeta this.
[3:10:18] <BinaryBetrayer> And what do you do to your lightsaber to fly with it?
[3:10:20] <Triblade1992> It sounds like a worse version of "Krytonite from Superman". Like the pink one makes you either gay or genderbends you
[3:10:20] <SinnerBeta> yes
[3:10:22] <rytisone> you got: a common color
[3:10:23] <beetbo2> What does that say about Dark sabers?
[3:10:26] <PulverKong> Vader could have just stolen someone's blue saber
[3:10:32] <+jorgamund> @PlagueOfGripes but is orange more evil than purple?
[3:10:49] <Wynzler> Yes, but only because Plague is using one
[3:10:50] <darkbotle> sith psy-ops: steal osme jedis lightsaber, bleed it and report him to the council
[3:10:54] <PulverKong> if you're an asshole it will be brown
[3:10:56] <SinnerBeta> @PlagueOfGripes only the sith ritual changes your ritual red, so you can't get one just by being an asshole
[3:11:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> I want to see the Jedi Masters react "Oh shit this padawan has the red one"
[3:11:08] <+Diabetic> @PlagueOfGripes I thought it mattered what crystal you got from one specific planet during construction..
[3:11:09] <ahegotrigger> a brown saber might actually be cool
[3:11:09] <+Comrade_Commando> please stop pronouncing orange that way
[3:11:10] <1qqq_fans> why evil only have one red color？
[3:11:11] <Cyral_Drive> What if you stop being an asshole
[3:11:19] <cap_bon> is the rest of cgi star wars cartoon good? I got to watch 1 season
[3:11:30] <geekjacob> remember reavens bane kiber crystal
[3:11:31] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Which cgi cartoon?
[3:11:37] <darkbotle> morally gray? This is star wars plague
[3:11:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> @cap_bon which one? If Clone wars, yes
[3:11:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> if Rebels, I dunno
[3:11:50] <cap_bon> its probably clone wars
[3:11:50] <Triblade1992> sounds like the krytonite problem.
[3:12:03] <SuperVaderMan> Clone wars was bad starting off and got better, Rebels is pretty bad throughout
[3:12:18] <ahegotrigger> putting subtlety in starwars could be pretty good
[3:12:21] <+HorribleHog> With a big enough franchise you can just pick and choose canon you like
[3:12:22] <kvassimoto> It's because of the war
[3:12:24] <Wynzler> 2003 Clone Wars was the shit though
[3:12:26] <+HorribleHog> *shrug*
[3:12:32] <Lelfro> orange man bad, red man evil
[3:12:34] <+Diabetic> @PlagueOfGripes and I thought it was red because you were confirming your loyalty to the Sith teachings, not just because you're evil just you follow the Sith
[3:12:35] <SinnerBeta> an evil person can get a green crystal since it's supposed to say "you have a deep connection with the force", not something about their personality. if they do the ritual then it can be come red, but only then
[3:12:36] <+askalta> i only fetishize plagues ideas
[3:12:39] <$SilverRoddo> Maybe they use chemicals to make the saber burn a different color.
[3:12:45] <ThirdPersonPhil> light puzzles
[3:12:57] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> So, you're more of a fan of soft magic systems than hard ones?
[3:12:59] <Habblewater> I wonder if there's ever been a superman story where someone made a "notalightsaber.tm" out of kryptonite and used it to fight Superman
[3:13:01] <darkbotle> the beams, redirect the beams
[3:13:18] <+JackalKing> My favorite saber color was one that was red but had a bright orange core. Made it look like you were wielding a saber made of liquid hot magma. Its what I used in SWTOR
[3:13:29] <kvassimoto> There is literally no time
[3:13:33] <cap_bon> in the justice league cartoon darkside did have a tiny little kryptonite knife
[3:13:41] <+FadingEmber> Video games are hard Kappa
[3:13:59] <+Diabetic> the crystals themselves are more what you find to construct it, you make the decision to find what you need to build it, it's locked in by the builder, not because the midocholorians decide you would look good with pink @PlagueOfGripes
[3:14:01] <Triblade1992> I think you plug that lever into it
[3:14:04] <kiwicoffin> Imagine Yoda fucking around with this
[3:14:08] <%Samex_Comex> BD got through
[3:14:10] <SinnerBeta> did the droid phase through the ice?
[3:14:16] <+HorribleHog> vibroblades > lightsabers DarkMode
[3:14:16] <cap_bon> getting some real War Within vibes from this place
[3:14:17] <BinaryBetrayer> Imagine Yoda doing anything at all without the Force
[3:14:35] <%JJCheeker> I get those everyday
[3:14:38] <TheWe4pon> *ring* *ring* *ring* Banana Phone
[3:14:40] <mortelkilll> these droids are improving
[3:14:40] <+HorribleHog> BinaryBetrayer I would've loved if yoda never used a lightsaber
[3:14:53] <Habblewater> I wish yoda had a skateboard
[3:14:55] <+FadingEmber> The robot call make me not want answer my phone
[3:14:56] <BinaryBetrayer> Too bad he became a living beyblade the second he touched one.
[3:15:06] <+HorribleHog> misikaHHA
[3:15:33] <SinnerBeta> speaking of which what's your lightsaber color list people? mine's green > purple > yellow > orange > red > blue
[3:15:44] <ThirdPersonPhil> that metal thing you pushed, any chances you cant attach the cristal to it?
[3:15:51] <cap_bon> was this place always like this? do jedi kids have to do all this shit ev erytime they want a crystal
[3:16:01] <BinaryBetrayer> It got dynamited at some point during the Clone Wars
[3:16:07] <deadstrat> Why are there no black light sabers?
[3:16:08] <cap_bon> fair enoguh
[3:16:20] <+HorribleHog> Look, the utility of R2-D2 in the package of a lunchbox
[3:16:22] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> There was one black lightsaber.
[3:16:24] <SinnerBeta> @deadstrat there's ONE in the disney canon
[3:16:35] <+Diabetic> I over think a lot of puzzles
[3:16:41] <jbees7> this puzzle feels more like a guessing game tho
[3:16:50] <+HorribleHog> It's ok to be slow Kappa
[3:16:51] <kiwicoffin> I enjoy puzzle boxes
[3:17:35] <ThirdPersonPhil> yeah... the thing is this is not much of a puzzle, its just find the interactables on the scene
[3:17:53] <deadstrat> I would have thought there would be way more tha just one. It is such an obvious color to use.
[3:18:08] <BinaryBetrayer> Jedi Plot Devices more like
[3:18:45] <+HorribleHog> God, why would the jedi have anything like this, it the plan to frustrate evil sith?
[3:18:50] <ahegotrigger> I think you have to swing back up there
[3:18:55] <+HorribleHog> is*
[3:18:57] <BinaryBetrayer> Something something Patience
[3:19:17] <ahegotrigger> nice
[3:19:22] <Habblewater> Gotta make becoming a jedi a pain in the ass to weed on the impure of heart or some shit
[3:19:23] <kvassimoto> LUL
[3:19:24] <+HorribleHog> wat
[3:19:29] <ThirdPersonPhil> without the force too
[3:19:35] <mortelkilll> yoda has big muscles
[3:19:42] <kiwicoffin> Yoda can assembe a Toyota Corolla with the force
[3:19:46] <Rosy_Joan> Yoda bought the player guide
[3:19:48] <%JJCheeker> Yoda have big Dick
[3:19:49] <Habblewater> Yoda lookin' like master roshi
[3:19:59] <ahegotrigger> no wait go back plague
[3:19:59] <+HorribleHog> that mechanic is well designed for 3rd person
[3:20:10] <SinnerBeta> yoda probably made it to torment the kids
[3:20:21] <+HorribleHog> Did Tomb Raider have hanging mechanics such as this? laeThinks
[3:20:29] <%Samex_Comex> This glider is amazing
[3:20:30] <darkbotle> "light enhacning crystals" *screams in physicist*
[3:20:36] <Wynzler> How often do you suppose they would have to use these contrived mechanisms to melt the ice?
[3:20:41] <BinaryBetrayer> Kids I hate, train them wrong I do.
[3:20:45] <Triblade1992> I think you are suppose to push the gem to the other side
[3:20:49] <Wynzler> Does ice grow on this planet?
[3:21:09] <%JJCheeker> Of course there is a puzzle involving reflecting light
[3:21:09] <+HorribleHog> Imagine having some sort of magic to just melt ice
[3:21:11] <Habblewater> yeah you gotta just plant an ice tree first
[3:21:23] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:21:29] <ahegotrigger> just plug it in
[3:21:31] <BinaryBetrayer> He could just chip a piece of crystal for his sword from that giant hanging crystal
[3:21:59] <ThirdPersonPhil> wrong side?
[3:22:23] <Triblade1992> wrong side
[3:22:36] <ThirdPersonPhil> noice
[3:22:45] <Rosy_Joan> clap
[3:22:49] <mortelkilll> @BinaryBetrayer behold my lightzweihander!
[3:23:00] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> protonGood
[3:23:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Another dark side fight is coming against a ghost, I can feel it
[3:23:45] <%JJCheeker> yes....
[3:23:49] <Wynzler> No he just took a while getting to you after you sat down
[3:23:53] <Triblade1992> It was in the unfinished Clone Wars episode series post Ahsoka leaving
[3:23:56] <SuperVaderMan> Death Star just shooting giant lightsaber beams at planets
[3:23:58] <%JJCheeker> Maybe he does
[3:24:09] <%JJCheeker> I mean you don't poop at all the game
[3:24:10] <darkbotle> "the wizards used to shit their pants" -george lucas, probably
[3:24:16] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Underwater on an ice planet.
[3:24:17] <%JJCheeker> Obviously he poops his pants
[3:24:20] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Oof.
[3:24:22] <BinaryBetrayer> Underwater Fire
[3:24:24] <rytisone> aaaand hypothermia
[3:24:30] <mortelkilll> those do exist
[3:24:31] <BinaryBetrayer> Maybe this is not water you're swimming in
[3:24:34] <Habblewater> Yeah, sea vents
[3:24:40] <Triblade1992> yes
[3:24:42] <+HorribleHog> ye
[3:24:44] <%Samex_Comex> The ocean is scary
[3:24:49] <mortelkilll> volcanic vents are full of nutrients
[3:24:50] <+HorribleHog> that's where we came from
[3:24:50] <Wynzler> And water bears, I'm assuming?
[3:24:54] <SinnerBeta> yoda: younglings, fuck them
[3:24:56] <Cyral_Drive> ocean is full of weird shit
[3:24:57] <%JJCheeker> The ocean terrify me
[3:24:59] <BinaryBetrayer> Crabs that are adapted to live in the darkness and pressure
[3:25:00] <+HorribleHog> probably
[3:25:02] <Triblade1992> they are born strong bois
[3:25:02] <cap_bon> we should purge the ocean
[3:25:03] <Habblewater> and the big weird dog dick coral that eats gas or some shit
[3:25:13] <SinnerBeta> lava crabs
[3:25:23] <ThirdPersonPhil> pressure is measured over surface right? guess been tiny would help?
[3:25:25] <canisdyluna> and the water is almost sulfuric acid
[3:25:34] <%JJCheeker> yes
[3:25:41] <Cyral_Drive> internet is a blessing and a curse
[3:25:45] <BinaryBetrayer> YOUNGLING
[3:25:46] <kvassimoto> Ughs in anger
[3:25:48] <+askalta> now im thinking about Delta P effect.
[3:25:50] <$SilverRoddo> If Deep Rising taught me anything, giant monstars lurk behind the ocean.
[3:25:57] <mortelkilll> the internet allowed us to know everything EVERYTHING
[3:25:58] <Wynzler> Jedi order really is a giant cult
[3:26:01] <SuperVaderMan> Don't let the dark side spread, it's like a disease
[3:26:11] <kvassimoto> Destroy the child
[3:26:14] <cap_bon> just hook that weird trivia shit to my veins internet
[3:26:14] <Wynzler> Westboro Baptist Church from space
[3:26:19] <SinnerBeta> UGHH *eyes become yellow*
[3:26:20] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Weird you say?
[3:26:20] <Lapinelis> 9 times out of 10, I love the internet. But that 1 time outta 10 really sucks
[3:26:20] <+HorribleHog> well we're likeminded people with similar interests gathered at a single point, spam the same bit of trivia on facebook and you'll get many likes! LUL
[3:26:22] <Gork_N_Mork> Dark side trolling tests
[3:26:25] <Habblewater> She stubbed her toe and got a little mad so we threw her off a cliff
[3:26:25] <Triblade1992> The problem is giving into anger by killing people. But hey, killing people while NOT being angry is Okie dokie, right?
[3:26:31] <Rosy_Joan> if you give into the darkside we cut your limbs off and roast you next to a lava river
[3:26:35] <geekjacob> Eli did you know star wars now how time travel.
[3:26:38] <%Samex_Comex> Cheat codes and porn
[3:26:42] <Triblade1992> Basically it's MGS2 in a nutshell
[3:26:44] <geekjacob> has
[3:26:45] <TheWe4pon> What if jedi and sith we're just police and criminals no religious bullshit and just "normal" people?
[3:26:49] <ThirdPersonPhil> citation needed
[3:26:59] <deadstrat> This reminds me of Tomb Raider
[3:27:01] <Habblewater> Go big or go home shit kids
[3:27:04] <Wynzler> Like a waaaaaaaand
[3:27:09] <Wynzler> It has to be specialllllll
[3:27:11] <+bitstorm_> LAME
[3:27:12] <aeravon> thats horse crap. KOTOR says so
[3:27:13] <rytisone> like a car
[3:27:14] <$SilverRoddo> The Dark Side version of South Park’s racism tunnel.
[3:27:15] <mortelkilll> its way too magic
[3:27:22] <cap_bon> how do you not have hypothermia or is that not a thing in star wars
[3:27:24] <darkbotle> What if your crystal in on some bumfuck planet that nobody has discovered yet?
[3:27:25] <mortelkilll> hmm toxic
[3:27:29] <Lelfro> I'm not evil, the force made me evil
[3:27:29] <geekjacob> kill the child
[3:27:36] <%JJCheeker> I agree
[3:27:43] <+HorribleHog> i see what you did there
[3:27:43] <BinaryBetrayer> Using the Force to force characters
[3:27:44] <BinaryBetrayer> Poetic
[3:27:47] <mortelkilll> yeah does make it like the force is micro-amnaging everything and no oen really is in control,
[3:27:47] <kvassimoto> ROCKS
[3:27:51] <Triblade1992> The Wills was almost a thing in George Lucas's version. The Whills were microscopic creatures that were suppose to move things.
[3:27:59] <Rosy_Joan> remember kids, if you arenr force sensitive you're a filthy peasant
[3:28:19] <mortelkilll> jeez the force sound super micro-managey
[3:28:21] <+HorribleHog> The force is really human centrist
[3:28:24] <Gork_N_Mork> Maybe if the force itself operated on orange blue morality or was incomprehensible outside of the Jedi/Sith interpretation
[3:28:28] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Isn't that just their religion?
[3:28:30] <geekjacob> the minaclorians said sooo
[3:28:34] <Rosy_Joan> the force is racist?
[3:28:37] <$SilverRoddo> He was the chosen one!
[3:28:38] <%JJCheeker> The force intended those younglings to get murdered
[3:28:38] <Wynzler> The Force, as it turns out, is SUPER high maintenance
[3:28:38] <pitsuji> whos gonna tell this dude "hey wait you dumb bitch this kyber crystal doesn't want you ass" if he just grabs any crystal
[3:28:38] <SinnerBeta> and if it was by accident, would've it been better?
[3:28:40] <Pechugaman> Eli is Kreia.
[3:28:42] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Looking at it from a storytelling perspective.
[3:28:49] <mortelkilll> i guess it oculd be their religion but its not liek we see other perspectives
[3:28:53] <Triblade1992> sounds like the kyber crystals are like the anti stand or anti zanpakutou
[3:28:53] <TheWe4pon> The force is a slut
[3:28:54] <Lelfro> maybe it's just like fate. it doesn't exist, but some believe it
[3:28:54] <ThirdPersonPhil> pass by a crystal and it just spits in your face
[3:28:59] <SinnerBeta> that crystal wants some ginger dick
[3:29:00] <Habblewater> This Kyber crystal thinks you're a fuckin' nerd
[3:29:00] <mortelkilll> star wars is msotly about giving jedis handjobs
[3:29:04] <kiwicoffin> It's the same half assed understanding that makes dudes use jackoff crystals
[3:29:07] <kvassimoto> The force can't be racist, because Mace Windu gave the midiclorians the N-word pass
[3:29:08] <robo_badger> Man, Kreia was great
[3:29:08] <BinaryBetrayer> It would be a different story if it focused on how the force is somehow manipulating siths and jedis along some inscrutable design but that story would fall flat with the current canon.
[3:29:28] <darkbotle> If star wars was a JRPG you would kill the force as the final boss
[3:29:29] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Space-Nietzsche?
[3:29:35] <Pechugaman> That's why she is such a great character. She wants to give meaning to life by denying the force.
[3:29:41] <kiwicoffin> It's like worshiping a pool of water
[3:29:46] <rytisone> also Anakin had no father, like Jesus
[3:29:54] <+HorribleHog> Well I mean that's the utopia
[3:29:54] <canisdyluna> but it is your des-tiny...
[3:29:58] <mortelkilll> to be honest im kind of on her side
[3:29:59] <BinaryBetrayer> What if some other kid wanted that crystal, did they slice their fingers trying to get it?
[3:29:59] <Wynzler> As much as we hate star wars now, at least it gave us some of the best music in cinema history
[3:30:00] <%JJCheeker> trying to find the maguffin?
[3:30:02] <mortelkilll> the force suck
[3:30:02] <Habblewater> well.
[3:30:03] <geekjacob> dark side hole
[3:30:10] <Triblade1992> It's sadly implied that Plaguies was the one that caused Anakin @rytisone
[3:30:20] <+dawsfloss> give into the force...
[3:30:29] <mortelkilll> man star wars almsot has as mcuh incest as naruto
[3:30:34] <jbournehd> amaaaziiiing
[3:30:35] <SinnerBeta> making force light and dark side was a mistake, it should've stayed as simply the force and a cancerous growth on it known as the dark side
[3:30:35] <cap_bon> I thought that was water he said as he plummeted to the ground
[3:30:36] <ahegotrigger> sexellent indeed
[3:30:39] <Pechugaman> I just love the bugs in this game.
[3:30:50] <darkbotle> Have I told you the story of Paguies the wise? He was a big smart man who did bad but in the end it was good for him
[3:30:59] <Wynzler> That is still the case, @SinnerBeta
[3:31:14] <Pechugaman> Did he ever get the bug in wich the poncho's physichs wo full wonky?
[3:31:33] <Habblewater> there's definitely a thing
[3:31:39] <zal_silverfang> speed run plague
[3:31:39] <BinaryBetrayer> It's ya boy invisible wall
[3:31:58] <Wynzler> Can't you hack those droids
[3:32:00] <Pechugaman> The force doesn't want you to go down there.
[3:32:01] <ThirdPersonPhil> dont you? dont the lady gave you a lightsaber?
[3:32:03] <zal_silverfang> @PlagueOfGripes UHH, did you just CUT that droid in half with the FORE???
[3:32:04] <%JJCheeker> If only you had a blaster...
[3:32:12] <pth88> You'll find out
[3:32:14] <mortelkilll> @ThirdPersonPhil its missing the crystal
[3:32:20] <ahegotrigger> maybe its just in your mind
[3:32:25] <BinaryBetrayer> It's all a dream
[3:32:27] <Sapphire_Breeze> wait why WOULDN'T there be imperials on a planet that houses Jedi crystals
[3:32:31] <darkbotle> the crystals were talking to the droid, DUH
[3:32:33] <kiwicoffin> I think all the jedi secrets were revealed after the purge
[3:32:34] <+HorribleHog> Your force is a dick, it coulda guided you to that hole but nooo
[3:32:34] <+dawsfloss> you can just drop down
[3:32:34] <Pechugaman> It's all part of the plan.
[3:32:39] <cap_bon> Having no free will because some tiny amoeba dictates all things must have balance sound awful
[3:32:39] <Sapphire_Breeze> Cal being surprised is dumb
[3:32:40] <Wynzler> Because your enemies don't have to follow the rules the geography of the game forces you to
[3:32:41] <$doomp12> the plo-I mean force has allowed it
[3:32:42] <Beefchief33> The Trials?
[3:32:47] <BinaryBetrayer> The crystal's telepathic call was intercepted by that imperial drone
[3:33:00] <ahegotrigger> true
[3:33:04] <%JJCheeker> I bet Rey could...
[3:33:10] <Sapphire_Breeze> or just throw a rock at it
[3:33:10] <darkbotle> just push it gently against the rocks
[3:33:15] <mortelkilll> if you could crumple droids into balls yo ucan also do it to humans
[3:33:17] <TheWe4pon> no but thats eeeevil
[3:33:17] <mortelkilll> thats gruesome
[3:33:24] <robo_badger> Force blade is cool so the Jedi don't get to use it
[3:33:25] <SinnerBeta> fastball special it
[3:33:26] <+dawsfloss> sounds like you wanna play force unleashed
[3:33:26] <+HorribleHog> Though "the Force wanted your character to learn patience by doing the puzzle so it guided you through the harder path"
[3:33:28] <canisdyluna> i hope he gets one of those helicopter lightsabers
[3:33:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Yeah
[3:33:37] <GaspidarIII> mans been streaming early
[3:33:40] <Pechugaman> If you were cool like Kylo you could stop the laser beams in mid air an throw them back at the droids.
[3:33:41] <BinaryBetrayer> Press button to fly away
[3:33:43] <%Samex_Comex> It's the thing from the movie
[3:33:44] <Cyral_Drive> bonehurtingbot
[3:33:56] <zal_silverfang> @JJCheeker naw, Rey would just turn the driods against the new Empire by somehow giving them free will and a soul through FOCE BULLSHIT
[3:33:57] <pth88> Pretty sure you can do that Pechu
[3:33:58] <Wynzler> I'm pretty sure you can freeze bolts in place and fire them back
[3:34:03] <Wynzler> You get a trophy for it
[3:34:10] <+HorribleHog> Right?! Neither did Yoda
[3:34:16] <BinaryBetrayer> They had weird superpowers
[3:34:19] <+HorribleHog> Good opposites
[3:34:21] <Triblade1992> He HATED Lightsabers back in the day. Then Sidious was like "Nah brah, I can duo weild"
[3:34:24] <pth88> Yes you can thank the prequels for that. I'll never forgive yoda pulling out a lightsaber
[3:34:26] <$SilverRoddo> If your Force Wi-fi is uninterruptible, one can raise submerged ships.
[3:34:44] <SuperVaderMan> But now everyone has to use lightsabers, even when it makes no sense for that particular species to use one
[3:34:47] <cap_bon> jesus how far down does that statue go
[3:34:49] <+HorribleHog> Sidious yucking it up with father and son clashing sabers at his face is so pure
[3:34:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Why can't you force lift spaceships and assault the death star from Dagobah or some shit.
[3:35:01] <%JJCheeker> It's too bad they don't like your Droid shoot a laser
[3:35:10] <SinnerBeta> Yes, that's how I saw it, jedi were knights and sith were wizards in classic fantasy sense, and vader was a fallen knight
[3:35:10] <mortelkilll> forcer sorcers would be cool
[3:35:12] <+dawsfloss> that's why Snoke seemed so cool, unique take on a force user but then wellllllll
[3:35:13] <%JJCheeker> Let*
[3:35:17] <Triblade1992> Sidious would have won if he had let Luke Skywalker kill him and gave Vader the keys to the Empire
[3:35:18] <darkbotle> make him stop saying youngling, please
[3:35:27] <Mikers29> he did throw all those booths at yoda
[3:35:30] <+HorribleHog> Y E S
[3:35:30] <SinnerBeta> sith should
[3:35:32] <Habblewater> they throw rocks at people
[3:35:32] <rosemon5001> @PlagueOfGripes in rebels he uses sith magic to attack ashoka in the time nexus
[3:35:35] <BinaryBetrayer> Using the force to magneto their bullets around would be cool
[3:35:42] <+Vestillion> How about force kung-fu?
[3:35:59] <Beefchief33> There is a sith girl in new cannon that uses the force to bend blaster shots like wanted
[3:36:02] <Triblade1992> @dawsfloss Snoke was just Emperor 2.0. The only way to make him the least bit interesting was to kill him and bring him back to life. That way it would be much dangerous
[3:36:10] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Wasn't Aurra Sing a former Jedi?
[3:36:15] <pth88> Overall I like the Ilum lore from this game though
[3:36:21] <BinaryBetrayer> You gotta Tomb Raider through the caves to get the crystal
[3:36:28] <SinnerBeta> sith should've been wizards, alchemists and manipulators that saw lightsabers as simpleton's tool since they mastered the force quicker. but say yoda who had more time shouldn't have a saber too, and just use force
[3:36:34] <%JJCheeker> Star Wars has a lot of stupid Lore
[3:36:45] <+SoleilAstier> Force martial arts could be cool, dealing damage internally with strikes @Vestillion
[3:37:00] <auhsojnala> Just popping in. They added the jedi crystal caves from the books? That's neat.
[3:37:03] <%JJCheeker> ye
[3:37:19] <darkbotle> Or they raise force zombies...
[3:37:20] <rytisone> unlimited power
[3:37:22] <rosemon5001> he used some sith fire magic in rebels
[3:37:26] <zal_silverfang> you were a KID? shocking. truly
[3:37:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Maybe drop a rock on that pit or something
[3:37:33] <mortelkilll> force sorcerers basiquelly would bend the force to their whim?
[3:37:42] <Triblade1992> Eh, the force was video games in the prequels. and Force lightning could have been used correctly via Jorus C'Boath
[3:37:50] <ThirdPersonPhil> and then it turns out that light sabers can reflect lightining
[3:37:56] <SinnerBeta> yeah, I felt the same way - force felt like level up powers in later works, rather than just being a force - lighting was simply sidious being so strong in the force it gained a physical form
[3:37:57] <canisdyluna> force push but at ultrasonic speed... tear the heart out of someone.. he he
[3:38:10] <+BuriasDempsey> I feel like no matter what happens in star wars people will view it negatively because no one agrees what to expect of out Fantasy/Sci-fi blend.
[3:38:13] <PulverKong> force gandalfs
[3:38:19] <BinaryBetrayer> So the force was like being aware of the matrix
[3:38:20] <PulverKong> that's how I looked at it as a kid
[3:38:25] <+lethallunacyx> That's also how i pictured it
[3:38:33] <+jepupu> Force Unleashed had you pulling down Star Destroyers
[3:38:37] <Habblewater> Seemed more like telekinesis/energy manipulation, but that kinda does make it relatively limitless
[3:39:08] <Triblade1992> that was rediculous though Jepupu
[3:39:10] <cap_bon> damn force proof ice
[3:39:17] <Habblewater> but i'd find it weird if they were throwing fireballs or some shit
[3:39:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Force proof ice
[3:39:34] <zal_silverfang> the problem with the Force is, like most Magic systems, the idea of it is s vague and the rules so loosely defined that it could in theory do anything thus become far too overpowered if not just nerfed but given no reason
[3:39:37] <SinnerBeta> that's why also hated dooku - while there was the expanded universe, the movies still had only one person that was a fallen jedi with a red lightsaber, and one special sith that could throw lighting. but that guy came around and retroactively made vader and sidious less special
[3:39:46] <BillieNoMates> Well you also have Starkiller tearing Star Destroyers from the sky
[3:39:53] <mortelkilll> i like that some star wars media treat black hole as that thing thats even beyond the force
[3:40:02] <mortelkilll> somethign even the force cant touch
[3:40:22] <auhsojnala> I grew up playing Knights of the Old Republics 1 & 2 before I ever watched the movies, so I always pictured the force as just space magic, but with hard limits for most force users (due to game mechanics)
[3:40:23] <Triblade1992> @SinnerBeta What was bad about Dooku was how he used it. Jorus C'Boath used Force Lightning too in the Thrawn Trilogy and that was never a criticism in those books
[3:40:46] <BinaryBetrayer> Oh no freezing vignette
[3:40:52] <SinnerBeta> @Triblade1992 I'd criticize it
[3:40:57] <Habblewater> eeesh, don't like that squeezing through caves shit
[3:41:14] <Chatterbox1991> Does the Sidious Book go in more on what your talking about?
[3:41:24] <Habblewater> Did Cal dye his hair then?
[3:41:26] <Wynzler> So like Avatar: TLA vs Legend of Korra?
[3:41:27] <ahegotrigger> not even
[3:41:27] <BillieNoMates> Trust me, my exceedingly ugly future self
[3:41:29] <Triblade1992> Funny enough Sinner, the thing that was Critisized was how Jorus C'Boath was a clone of a Jedi
[3:41:32] <SuperVaderMan> perfectly dry LUL
[3:41:34] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:41:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:41:41] <don_fluffle> The best magic system is science
[3:41:46] <kvassimoto> Force dry
[3:41:54] <ahegotrigger> fuck water
[3:42:00] <PulverKong> he force pushed the water out of his hair
[3:42:04] <Habblewater> And he shines a big flashlight at them
[3:42:05] <zal_silverfang> and yet, with a soft magic system, if anyone is not using magic or magic is not the be all end all of the society it makes people question as to "why isnt magic just everywhere and abused by everyone"?
[3:42:09] <Chatterbox1991> Unless im mistaken the Sidious book talks about he or plagus litterally created Anakin in Smee's womb
[3:42:18] <cap_bon> when does the stalker jump out and attack you
[3:42:18] <Gettinfries> Introducing magic is like introducing time travel, it opens so many questions than the writers probably thought about.
[3:42:31] <BillieNoMates> So why are we needing this new genital piercing stone?
[3:42:33] <BinaryBetrayer> You can see the part of the crystal where it was ready to be split
[3:42:33] <BillieNoMates> AHAHAH
[3:42:34] <robo_badger> Any color is better than blue
[3:42:35] <SinnerBeta> force should be low-key reality bending - not just snap your fingers and make pudding appear, but rather just making the impossible to happen regardless of the size, like how Yoda picked up the x-wing
[3:42:35] <kvassimoto> LUL
[3:42:37] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[3:42:37] <ahegotrigger> hahahahahaha
[3:42:38] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:42:39] <Habblewater> get fucked nerd
[3:42:41] <Wynzler> GOT EEM
[3:42:43] <Triblade1992> wow, they actually got rid of it
[3:42:45] <$Jathspuh> Jebaited
[3:42:45] <PulverKong> the krystal rejekted you
[3:42:46] <geekjacob> fuck you you get nothing
[3:42:47] <Cyral_Drive> BabyRage
[3:42:48] <+bitstorm_> lol nerd Jebaited
[3:42:49] <BinaryBetrayer> Fuck, it's the same model as the giant crystals you were pushing around.
[3:42:50] <mortelkilll> that crystal was a troll
[3:42:52] <canisdyluna> HAHAHAH
[3:42:52] <kvassimoto> :(
[3:42:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> LLU
[3:42:54] <robo_badger> Crystal was like SIKES
[3:42:55] <$SilverRoddo> RPGOops RPGOops
[3:42:56] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:42:56] <BinaryBetrayer> Yeah ignore the giant crystal you're leaning on.
[3:42:58] <SinnerBeta> the crystal saw a ginger picked it up so it went NOPE
[3:43:03] <thatzazzguy> isn't that entire rock formation a kyber crystal? or just the tip
[3:43:04] <PulverKong> just shove the crystal into your forehead and become Diablo
[3:43:09] <cap_bon> so wait does that mean whos ever crystal that was now cant get a lightsaber
[3:43:21] <rytisone> kiss the droid
[3:43:26] <SinnerBeta> cute chicken bot
[3:43:26] <Triblade1992> cute droid is cute
[3:43:30] <Pechugaman> It was I BD1. I was the Jedi Master all along
[3:43:41] <Lelfro> the droid filmed itself
[3:43:42] <SuperVaderMan> So if BD had this hologram of himself, then who recorded it
[3:43:43] <zal_silverfang> bad writing, in Star Wars? NOOOOO
[3:43:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> I like this 160p low res hologram
[3:43:55] <$doomp12> how does BD have footage of itself?
[3:43:56] <%Samex_Comex> Wait the droid can record its self?
[3:44:08] <ahegotrigger> what an amazing droid
[3:44:10] <PulverKong> Bob Ross said it the best. "There are no failures. Just happy little mistakes"
[3:44:12] <gordieda20> LUL
[3:44:14] <BinaryBetrayer> The droid records itself
[3:44:14] <$SilverRoddo> Is the droid a Jedi?!
[3:44:14] <cap_bon> hey man holograms are expensive they cant afford 1080p holograms
[3:44:16] <canisdyluna> the cristel is in BD
[3:44:19] <geekjacob> i am one with the force the force is with me i am one with the force the force is with me
[3:44:20] <canisdyluna> fuck me
[3:44:21] <zal_silverfang> the droid used Force Vision
[3:44:24] <PulverKong> Bob Ross is the true Jedi
[3:44:25] <canisdyluna> if i am rat
[3:44:28] <+BuriasDempsey> I mean, r2d2 recorded himself too in the original trilogy too
[3:44:31] <Pechugaman> It might be Bad Writting, but it always makes me happy when they go on and on about how the light will prevail. Even if it's total bullshit and the Force always fucks them up.
[3:44:32] <BinaryBetrayer> The droid had the crystal ALL ALONG
[3:44:34] <SuperVaderMan> Being a droid in star wars must be the most horrifying thing
[3:44:40] <+SoleilAstier> how dod this recording happen
[3:44:46] <Triblade1992> so basically what it's suppose to do
[3:44:46] <SinnerBeta> imagine if the droid was a hk-47 instead
[3:44:49] <Pechugaman> The droid was the crystal all along.
[3:44:50] <Rosy_Joan> BD1 is actually a lightsaber, no it doesnt schange shape just swing the box.
[3:44:55] <geekjacob> window 98 sounds
[3:44:59] <robo_badger> I miss HK-47
[3:45:00] <BinaryBetrayer> The crystal is the droids we met along the way
[3:45:08] <cap_bon> dont worry sentient droid creature soon your memories will be wiped because your my property
[3:45:09] <ThirdPersonPhil> the one droid to rule them all
[3:45:09] <%Samex_Comex> Just like when windows updates
[3:45:09] <%JJCheeker> Damn organic meatbags
[3:45:15] <PulverKong> If the Sith didn't have the fuckin stupid "Rule of Two" they'd literally rule the galaxy hundred times over
[3:45:22] <Rosy_Joan> droids are the subhuman heart of the story
[3:45:28] <+jepupu> Deus ex Machina
[3:45:31] <kvassimoto> Always two there are, the Mary Sue and the droid
[3:45:32] <SinnerBeta> None of that was in Solo?
[3:45:38] <+misterfistor> so you like Mandalorian
[3:45:42] <Sapphire_Breeze> HK-47: "Hello meatbag"
[3:45:43] <+twistingt0rt0ise> who is recording this?
[3:45:46] <Pechugaman> Nah, Darth Kraith tried to destroy the Rule of two. He fucked up
[3:45:48] <Twad_Feu> lets flip it then, badass droid MC with a cute [insert alien here] sidekick
[3:45:51] <PulverKong> HEY! WATCH IT! EMOTIONS!
[3:45:51] <Habblewater> Like that evil c3p0
[3:45:54] <PulverKong> dark side!
[3:46:03] <Triblade1992> @PulverKong Not with the whole "Sith kill each other" part. too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the pot and all
[3:46:04] <%Samex_Comex> use glue
[3:46:06] <ahegotrigger> hes gonna fix it
[3:46:07] <$SilverRoddo> The crystal was the journey, not the destination. mikeliveGadgetHmm
[3:46:08] <%JJCheeker> Excuse me meatb... I mean master
[3:46:17] <Cyral_Drive> hey look an ice workbench
[3:46:17] <zal_silverfang> @PlagueOfGripes so like, do the droids have a language that people can actually understand or is it "i can read their emotions" pokemon rules???
[3:46:18] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[3:46:19] <BinaryBetrayer> It was a fake crystal
[3:46:21] <ahegotrigger> and then you can have your koolaid colored light sword
[3:46:22] <cap_bon> grind that crystal up and snort it
[3:46:22] <BinaryBetrayer> fake calling you
[3:46:27] <kvassimoto> Watch those wrist rockets
[3:46:32] <BinaryBetrayer> Oh my god
[3:46:33] <Pechugaman> MAKE IT RED
[3:46:34] <ahegotrigger> yup
[3:46:36] <BinaryBetrayer> Oh my fucking god.

[3:47:23] <+Ikari_Sunshine> purple or green
[3:47:24] <SinnerBeta> Sinestro's Might!
[3:47:25] <BinaryBetrayer> This feel like you're joining a Lantern Corps
[3:47:29] <+bitstorm_> green/yellow one
[3:47:30] <$Jathspuh> PINK
[3:47:30] <PulverKong> this is kinda snot coloured
[3:47:31] <ahegotrigger> go with pink for his boy hood fantasies
[3:47:31] <Beefchief33> Red
[3:47:32] <TheWe4pon> Pink
[3:47:32] <Triblade1992> Pink is funny.
[3:47:34] <%JJCheeker> Teal is good
[3:47:38] <Wynzler> Cyan is dope looking
[3:47:38] <+TrueSpartan14> Cyan!
[3:47:40] <%Samex_Comex> Grape
[3:47:40] <$SilverRoddo> 💕
[3:47:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> Pink looks cool
[3:47:41] <+Huderga> pink is for dumb memers
[3:47:42] <kiwicoffin> Ask BD what color you should have
[3:47:42] <ahegotrigger> pink for putting it in his master
[3:47:51] <SinnerBeta> You'll be a green lantern
[3:47:51] <BinaryBetrayer> How does that work, you're just rotating the crystal
[3:47:51] <PulverKong> we don't get to chose red D:
[3:47:56] <Twad_Feu> red is EEEEvvvvil
[3:47:59] <Triblade1992> NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE RED
[3:48:02] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Indigo HahaShrugMiddle
[3:48:03] <Lelfro> pink is white red
[3:48:06] <ThirdPersonPhil> i bet none of these colors will look like they are shown here
[3:48:06] <mortelkilll> pink is almost red
[3:48:07] <iambqb> That weird over the top black one with white electricity that only exists in a few games
[3:48:08] <geekjacob> because we havent bleed it yet
[3:48:09] <Triblade1992> Or black
[3:48:10] <ahegotrigger> red is a sin
[3:48:11] <+BuriasDempsey> isn't red made by torturing the crystal?
[3:48:15] <Pechugaman> Maybe the red is the Bd we made along the crystal.
[3:48:16] <SquigglyLizard> no invokes emotions and emotions are EVIL
[3:48:17] <Wynzler> Cyan thoooo
[3:48:17] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> The Jedi must really hate Mario.
[3:48:19] <kvassimoto> <3
[3:48:20] <PulverKong> pinku
[3:48:20] <rytisone> pink jedi
[3:48:20] <+bitstorm_> everyone does pink
[3:48:22] <%JJCheeker> Pretty in pink
[3:48:23] <+SoleilAstier> pink yes
[3:48:25] <baronvonbirman> red like the tip of an inflamed penis
[3:48:26] <+ratchetex> pink is just light colored red
[3:48:29] <kiwicoffin> Purple is pretty legit though
[3:48:30] <+misterfistor> pink is pretty useless yes
[3:48:31] <SinnerBeta> actually yes, you have to torture your crystal to get it red now
[3:48:32] <Habblewater> where's my brown fightsaber
[3:48:32] <ThirdPersonPhil> its for dual wielding now
[3:48:33] <ahegotrigger> HAHAHAHA
[3:48:37] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Or every Jedi ever was never allowed to be Player 1.
[3:48:39] <$Jathspuh> lore PogChamp
[3:48:40] <Cyral_Drive> LUL
[3:48:42] <Gork_N_Mork> LUL
[3:48:44] <Wynzler> *I* will be the lightsaber now
[3:48:45] <SinnerBeta> the two pieces fused back together probably lol
[3:48:45] <iambqb> imagine how powerful you would be
[3:48:45] <%JJCheeker> Now you match your Droid
[3:48:53] <PulverKong> does this mean you get...TWO lightsabers
[3:48:56] <$doomp12> RED IS EVIL the autobots just sitting in a corner came to mind for some reason
[3:48:57] <Pechugaman> HOW IS HE DOING THAT
[3:49:00] <Pechugaman> HE HAS NO TOOLS
[3:49:01] <Habblewater> That's how you get force powers
[3:49:03] <ahegotrigger> snort the kaiber crystals to die instantly
[3:49:05] <ThirdPersonPhil> if you were gonna do 2 you should have picked up 2 colors
[3:49:07] <BinaryBetrayer> I like how they hide the working on the lightsaber because they can't model it
[3:49:09] <kvassimoto> A fusion cutter is all you need
[3:49:09] <$SilverRoddo> Kyber Bath salts.
[3:49:11] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Like Ashoka?
[3:49:13] <+misterfistor> kotor
[3:49:17] <robo_badger> That does sound rad
[3:49:17] <Habblewater> yeah Kotor
[3:49:18] <SuperVaderMan> you can do that in kotor 2 yeh
[3:49:22] <pth88> In KoToR you can get short sabers
[3:49:24] <ThirdPersonPhil> Tonfa saber \o/
[3:49:24] <%JJCheeker> Kind of like kotor
[3:49:27] <geekjacob> he would have been a forge master in the old cannon]
[3:49:29] <kvassimoto> PogChamp
[3:49:31] <SinnerBeta> @PlagueOfGripes that's shoto lightsaber
[3:49:35] <+JackalKing> That is what Ahsoka did in Clone Wars. One normal sized saber and one shorter one
[3:49:38] <iambqb> The light saber technology should spread to all forms of medieval weaponry
[3:49:43] <Triblade1992> Is it like Pink Krytonite where the Kryptonian becomes either gay or genderbended to be a girl
[3:49:44] <iambqb> We need Great Sword variants
[3:49:44] <Brissar> Luke had a short offhand saber in the comics
[3:49:51] <Habblewater> Where are my Greatsabers
[3:49:52] <ironwill_mne> @pth88 Kotor?
[3:49:52] <Lelfro> big, long and pink!
[3:49:53] <PulverKong> that huge stick will poke a hole in his ribs before tomorrow
[3:49:59] <don_fluffle> A swordbreaker lightsaber
[3:50:00] <kiwicoffin> It's not a two handed stance
[3:50:03] <Pechugaman> That's fuckign lame
[3:50:05] <pth88> @ironwill_mne Knights of the Old republic
[3:50:05] <+ratchetex> that sucks
[3:50:07] <$SilverRoddo> He did it.
[3:50:09] <+misterfistor> the move is different if you use it in double mod and single mode
[3:50:10] <%JJCheeker> That is dumb
[3:50:12] <+misterfistor> its a strong attack
[3:50:12] <BinaryBetrayer> This is so dissapointing
[3:50:16] <BinaryBetrayer> BD play despacito.
[3:50:17] <pth88> It's a power attack.
[3:50:17] <Wynzler> It breaks through guards
[3:50:18] <rytisone> it's an extra attack
[3:50:19] <ThirdPersonPhil> double better then dual wielding confirmed!
[3:50:20] <+Huderga> it's in single form too
[3:50:21] <auhsojnala> thought it was going to be a trick weapon, a la bloodborne
[3:50:25] <geekjacob> more damage i guess?
[3:50:26] <kiwicoffin> It's powerful and fuck you
[3:50:28] <+Zerodyne90> its kinda op
[3:50:29] <%Violated_Muffins> try the split attack mid string maybe??
[3:50:29] <SinnerBeta> you can switch between single and double blade, dual saber is a special attack that costs force
[3:50:33] <pth88> He didn't learn that stlye
[3:50:33] <Cyral_Drive> its a chain
[3:50:39] <BinaryBetrayer> Try to fly with it
[3:50:40] <baronvonbirman> The inaffectual wiggling of the double sabesr offends to behold
[3:50:51] <kvassimoto> Do the light saber helicopter @PlagueOfGripes
[3:50:53] <Pechugaman> Holy shit
[3:50:59] <Lelfro> helicopter out of here
[3:51:02] <ironwill_mne> @pth88 I live close to town named Kotor
[3:51:02] <$SilverRoddo> It’s a Musou attack scheme, square square triangle. So on, and so forth.
[3:51:13] <rosemon5001> throw it while dual wielding
[3:51:15] <BinaryBetrayer> Why is orange premium
[3:51:17] <+HorribleHog> three different shades of blue
[3:51:20] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Did it just say Omitted?
[3:51:20] <Pechugaman> Why not let you choose like Jedi Academy?
[3:51:21] <SinnerBeta> single saber is better against few opponents, staff is better against multiple enemies
[3:51:24] <cap_bon> do all jedi bounce around flailing their lightsabre once they find their crystals
[3:51:35] <$jobbedbone> lightsabers are pay to win?
[3:51:40] <SinnerBeta> purple drank
[3:51:43] <+bitstorm_> each colour should have a slightly different tone
[3:51:43] <PulverKong> what defines the point of the light saber though
[3:51:48] <+misterfistor> all the crystal colors have their own sound effect when you ignite btw
[3:51:53] <Wynzler> If the crystal is in two pieces now why can't you have two colors
[3:51:54] <Lelfro> teal
[3:51:54] <+HorribleHog> PulverKong force
[3:51:57] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Looks almost like the Z-Saber.
[3:51:59] <SinnerBeta> @PulverKong a forcefield IIRC
[3:52:14] <+Punishedkaiger> The ignition sound changed too
[3:52:20] <kvassimoto> BEST COLOR
[3:52:20] <SinnerBeta> green is best, blue is worst, everything else is in-between
[3:52:23] <+HorribleHog> it's just force magic
[3:52:26] <Cyral_Drive> I went with yellow
[3:52:31] <auhsojnala> everything else > blue > green
[3:52:31] <Triblade1992> Yellow was given to the Jedi who did the Library
[3:52:31] <+SoleilAstier> back to pink
[3:52:33] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes Listen to the ignition sounds for each
[3:52:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> the cyan one reminds of Luke's saber in Ep 4 before George color corrected it
[3:52:42] <+misterfistor> the Plo Koon route
[3:52:51] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Oh, it said Premium Content.
[3:52:53] <canisdyluna> i seem to remember a silver one in Knights of the old republic
[3:53:07] <SinnerBeta> you wouldn't pick Plague, the crystal would read your personality and probably make it brown
[3:53:17] <PulverKong> I'm surprised that we didn't start out with a vibroblade in this game
[3:53:24] <ThirdPersonPhil> lime
[3:53:27] <+HorribleHog> The ignition noise sounds me of the saber hit sound from ep6
[3:53:31] <kiwicoffin> I think it would have been cooler if the majority of visible jedi were not armed
[3:53:31] <Mikers29> snowflake would be a good color for a lightsaber
[3:53:33] <SinnerBeta> needs to be a bit darker
[3:53:35] <%hgtarras> I thought the kyber crystals pick your color ?
[3:53:39] <rosemon5001> crazy fan theory since the sith crystals are more unstable why arent they rainbow colored
[3:53:40] <Triblade1992> Blame the prequels for having SOOOO many green, blue and red lightsabers
[3:53:44] <cap_bon> piss yellow sabre
[3:53:47] <ThirdPersonPhil> there is a little saber stand on that anciente slab of ice?
[3:53:50] <+Vestillion> On the inverse of that same problem, If you dare to pick Blue or green or red, you're basic and lack imagination
[3:54:01] <Sapphire_Breeze> Jesus would use red
[3:54:03] <Lelfro> Jesus would use red
[3:54:11] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Space-Jesus.
[3:54:11] <+misterfistor> gimme dat Aqua cyan color from kotor
[3:54:11] <$jobbedbone> looks white to me
[3:54:12] <kvassimoto> Blue is the color of Israel
[3:54:16] <+Zerodyne90> Jesus would use red
[3:54:17] <+JackalKing> Green. The color for people that dont want to be as generic as blue, but also don't want to stand out too much.
[3:54:23] <ChoculaUltra> you guys ever take a crack at SWTOR? My Sith Warrior is rocking the edgelord black beam with red glow lol.
[3:54:24] <BinaryBetrayer> Jesus would pick red and use it to cut merchants selling shit on the steps to the temple.
[3:54:41] <auhsojnala> my sith sorcerer has a purple-black atm
[3:54:43] <Explodincatz> the Blingsaber
[3:54:47] <PulverKong> Black core with red outline for the metalcore jedi kids
[3:55:01] <+misterfistor> all of these look hella uncomfortable to grip
[3:55:04] <ChoculaUltra> the black-blue blades are chaotic good af.
[3:55:06] <kiwicoffin> The red metal material is the only one that stood out to me
[3:55:08] <PulverKong> Jedi Trivium fans
[3:55:32] <BinaryBetrayer> Ribbed for your pleasure
[3:55:52] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Elemental nature?
[3:55:57] <Lelfro> no tactical advantage tho
[3:56:09] <+misterfistor> Cere will be part of you forever :)
[3:56:14] <Wynzler> That's where the two connect
[3:56:27] <Triblade1992> Dolovite looks cool
[3:56:38] <kiwicoffin> yeah dolovite is the one
[3:56:41] <Hasuke> Red saber BAD. Red handle OKAY.
[3:56:43] <ChoculaUltra> whoa, is this Ilum or Hoth? Cuz it looks like it could be either.
[3:56:50] <Exadata_> does changing parts change stats or is it cosmetic?
[3:56:54] <rytisone> tiem to win miss jedi crown
[3:57:01] <Wynzler> 100% cosmetic
[3:57:02] <Beefchief33> Ilum
[3:57:08] <Exadata_> nice
[3:57:10] <+Zerodyne90> I tell you hwat CoolStoryBob
[3:57:18] <+Fatemaster> It isn't Star Wars unless you feel pretty. tppowerFree
[3:57:27] <ChoculaUltra> holy crap, Ilum?! Is that like the first time Ilum has been featured in a main timeline star wars game?
[3:57:29] <kiwicoffin> Fashion Wars
[3:57:38] <auhsojnala> nothing is more important than the aesthetic of a weapon that you can't even see
[3:57:41] <SinnerBeta> speaking of SWTOR, they experimented with saber colors a bit, for example you could have a green saber with a black core and other combinations like that
[3:58:26] <ChoculaUltra> Actually finished the Ilum leg of the planetary storyline in SWTOR the other day. Darth Malgus is a stylish asshole and I love it.
[3:58:29] <Triblade1992> This is probably the best part of the game: Designing the Lightsaber
[3:58:36] <auhsojnala> yeah, you can make or buy a ton of different color crystals, w/the artificer class or market
[3:58:38] <jebus_the_methman> a shame this game is so mediocre in everything, i really enjoyed the combat and with a little more refining that game could've become a really good Force Unleashed
[3:58:42] <ThirdPersonPhil> a bunch of these handles would give you horrible callous
[3:59:02] <%Samex_Comex> It looks like a lamp
[3:59:03] <Triblade1992> It's the Luke Return of the Jedi lightsaber
[3:59:04] <Lelfro> it looks like a candlestick
[3:59:05] <+askalta> i like it, libert bell saber
[3:59:06] <+HorribleHog> candleholder
[3:59:07] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Forgot the O-Saber from the Mega Man Zero games was pink/.
[3:59:13] <PulverKong> all of these are pretty awful grip-wise
[3:59:13] <+Fatemaster> Plunger on the end.
[3:59:17] <Explodincatz> looks like old copper
[3:59:19] <cap_bon> forbidden fleshlight
[3:59:24] <kiwicoffin> Red as Cal's pubes
[3:59:25] <rosemon5001> wut you dont like the candle light saber lol
[3:59:28] <TheWe4pon> is SWTOR any good?
[3:59:35] <rytisone> now just put on pink poncho
[3:59:50] <SinnerBeta> this game should have a new game+ and give you stuff like a red crystal and some robes
[3:59:50] <robo_badger> Emotions are prohibited
[3:59:50] <$SilverRoddo> Put a shotgun undermount, for tactical close quarters encounters.
[3:59:54] <ChoculaUltra> did no Sith or Jedi ever hear of a rubber grip? All the hilts look so smooth a slip out is bound to happen
[3:59:56] <kvassimoto> LUL
[4:00:07] <kiwicoffin> Turns out the were here the whole time. Guess Cere didn't know. Oops
[4:00:08] <PulverKong> lol that taunt when you were running STRAIGHT for him.. "oh nowwww he's runnin"
[4:00:08] <mortelkilll> time to make these fuckers taste the rainbow
[4:00:14] <jbournehd> Why wont they just run away immediately?
[4:00:15] <auhsojnala> @TheWe4pon it's a mediocre MMO imo, but I like it because of the setting (old republic, though over a century after KOTOR 2)
[4:00:15] <jaxondorf> now this is pod racing
[4:00:28] <rytisone> heroic music for murdering people
[4:00:29] <jbournehd> Kill them all Cal
[4:00:29] <+Zerodyne90> this place is really crazy
[4:00:32] <+HorribleHog> why aren't they shooting him
[4:00:34] <jbournehd> they deserved it
[4:00:39] <cap_bon> what do they do to jedi that stray from the code do they just murder them?
[4:00:40] <darkbotle> how stupid is it to fight against a jedi in close quarter combat?
[4:00:53] <PulverKong> SWTOR is a very generic MMO but has the cool character storyline quests that you can basically solo through
[4:00:57] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @cap_bon They just get excommunicated.
[4:01:06] <PulverKong> there's tons of "kill x of x" grindy quests
[4:01:22] <ChoculaUltra> There's even some raids you can solo - they outfit your party with characters you've met during your storyline. P neat.
[4:01:24] <Triblade1992> Man, what is this? Kill a thousand heartless challenge without the fun?
[4:01:25] <%Samex_Comex> I guess you use the force to keep one lit and that's why there is only one switch?
[4:01:26] <+BuriasDempsey> Why do none of them have any guns?!
[4:01:33] <cap_bon> So do they just lose their light sabre then
[4:01:37] <PulverKong> every class has its own kinda solo story and those are really cool. it's all the MMO grindy shit that ruins it
[4:01:47] <jbournehd> time to shit your pants
[4:01:50] <Triblade1992> bye
[4:01:59] <ECRead> that wasn't very light side of you
[4:02:06] <+askalta> can you cook meat with a lightsaber
[4:02:12] <PulverKong> you can't avoid the boring MMO shit because you have to level up alongside everyone else

[4:02:37] <kiwicoffin> I wish there was more ambiguity about Cal's path but he's just so damn sure he's gotta be Jedi
[4:02:39] <OminousBagel> Shark week... lol
[4:02:42] <+jepupu> Edgy
[4:02:46] <ChoculaUltra> robot hugs.
[4:02:49] <rytisone> all of them
[4:02:49] <jbournehd> Iron giant time
[4:02:49] <Habblewater> Do not resist
[4:02:51] <+misterfistor> they go at you two at a time mostly
[4:02:59] <+misterfistor> unless you provoke em
[4:03:00] <Twad_Feu> Son?!
[4:03:01] <Habblewater> BAH GAWD
[4:03:05] <+HorribleHog> Remember Rogue One?!
[4:03:08] <$SilverRoddo> Come at me bro mode.
[4:03:15] <darkbotle> choke me harder, said cal
[4:03:17] <Triblade1992> This reminds me of when you had to lead all those shadows in the Witcher 3 DLC Heart of Stone
[4:03:23] <auhsojnala> are the droids trying to bully him into giving up?
[4:03:24] <cap_bon> Imagine having to repaint the ship everytime some arsehole protagonist feels like a change in coloir
[4:03:33] <jbournehd> What, are these smack talk droids?
[4:03:41] <laserbeaming> Bye Mr Gripes. Have fun complaining about SW
[4:03:45] <laserbeaming> I know I do
[4:03:59] <Lelfro> bitchslap contest
[4:04:00] <kiwicoffin> I think you can just leave now
[4:04:04] <Twad_Feu> for empire droids.. they are kind of disapointing
[4:04:12] <jebus_the_methman> @jbournehd a reference to Rogue One
[4:04:12] <Habblewater> slapdroids
[4:04:29] <+BuriasDempsey> what is the purpose of those droids?
[4:04:32] <jbournehd> Ah thanks, never seen it
[4:04:50] <geekjacob> the crate behind you
[4:04:58] <rytisone> what else a huge republic base would be here for?
[4:05:05] <SinnerBeta> where's your pink poncho to go with that saber?
[4:05:13] <+HorribleHog> BuriasDempsey probably to be more useful than c3po
[4:05:14] <Habblewater> "What's that bright purple thing i'm staring directly at?"
[4:05:26] <+Fatemaster> They need a bath.
[4:05:32] <$doomp12> no, cal just assumed that, because what else is this planet good for?
[4:05:34] <jebus_the_methman> @BuriasDempsey apparently they were some kind of crowd control droid to support the normal forces
[4:05:50] <Exadata_> to be fair being able to land a hit on a jedi must feel really special
[4:05:55] <ChoculaUltra> there was this theory that the Starkiller Base from Force Awakens was Ilum, kinda seeing it now looking at this Imperial base thingy
[4:05:56] <Habblewater> HERO
[4:05:58] <+Remery_> penetrated
[4:05:59] <BillieNoMates> prolapsed
[4:06:00] <+Zerodyne90> neat way to die
[4:06:03] <jbournehd> Are you realy a hero?
[4:06:04] <OminousBagel> Lightsaber Colonic
[4:06:22] <+BuriasDempsey> Huh, guess I'd have to read up more cause they looked like they couldn't do shit. @jebus_the_methman
[4:06:31] <kiwicoffin> No I control the camera and you have to look where I tell you
[4:06:38] <jbournehd> I care more about these random stormtroopers than I do about mc
[4:06:53] <+Zerodyne90> what happened there
[4:06:57] <Triblade1992> @ChoculaUltra That's weird because Star Wars resistance showed off multiple planets with their core drilled out as failed Starkiller Bases
[4:07:09] <+misterfistor> i wish force regen'd like it did in Outcast or Academy
[4:07:23] <+HorribleHog> slow lasers
[4:07:30] <+HorribleHog> or blasters
[4:07:34] <+Zerodyne90> quick push suffices actually
[4:07:58] <ChoculaUltra> @Triblade1992 mayhaps this was the only working "prototype" thing they had. Like oh hey, we tapped this thing of all the Kyber, lets shove a laser in it.
[4:08:27] <+HorribleHog> I wish they had the MG34's and not those gungan shield weapons
[4:08:27] <jebus_the_methman> @BuriasDempsey imagine that they are HK-47 from Knights of the Old Republic but inferior in everything, especially the banter
[4:08:58] <jbournehd> Good thing those soliders dont have wives or kids so that we can kill them with less remorse
[4:09:01] <OminousBagel> The Jedi Order was in you all along!
[4:09:28] <kiwicoffin> We will achieve this vague dream of an idea by collecting young lives and making an army
[4:09:38] <ChrisM341> Hi everyone
[4:09:39] <kiwicoffin> We'll call it...Outer Heaven
[4:09:56] <SinnerBeta> drods be like "get. fucked. hooman."
[4:09:57] <$SilverRoddo> mikeliveFreeze The slice man, cometh.
[4:10:13] <ChoculaUltra> has the Empire ever had like a droid made entirely of cortosis or beskar? They probably didn't need it after Order 66 and all that, but still.
[4:10:20] <rytisone> around
[4:10:20] <+misterfistor> longer swing
[4:10:26] <+Kawaii_Joker> Just keep going you will end up there
[4:11:00] <kiwicoffin> The force will not allow it
[4:11:02] <Habblewater> @ChoculaUltra probably too expensive for what it needed to do, like making a gold ak47
[4:11:22] <ChoculaUltra> true true
[4:11:28] <$SilverRoddo> You only miss 100 percent of the jumps you don’t make.
[4:11:43] <jbournehd> Inhale ghost farts
[4:11:46] <SuperVaderMan> I wonder how many children have died in these cave
[4:11:48] <SuperVaderMan> s
[4:12:06] <Exadata_> you miss 100% of the jumps you dont land
[4:12:35] <rytisone> I just want Cal to find a frozen child body
[4:12:44] <OminousBagel> They just waved their hands and did the old mind tricks
[4:12:56] <%Samex_Comex> Sweet I don't have to feed them anymore
[4:12:57] <kerotuyu> "Eh, I didn't want it, anyway"
[4:12:57] <robo_badger> The Republic citizens REALLY hate children I guess
[4:12:58] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> I remember some people not being okay.
[4:12:59] <kvassimoto> It's an ultra-galactic organization
[4:13:03] <SquigglyLizard> i bet dying in this cave is a sin too
[4:13:04] <ChoculaUltra> I'm still shocked that the Jedi Council said Anakin was "too old" in Episode 1. Like cot damn, do you guys take these kids right after they come out the womb?
[4:13:05] <kiwicoffin> I would hope it's like the harry potter universe where their powers manifest and they can't control them on their own
[4:13:07] <Triblade1992> This is why Luke being 19 when he was trained makes sense
[4:13:08] <Habblewater> But your baby will become a space witch! Or maybe they'll just die in a cave
[4:13:08] <+ratchetex> also they can't talk to their parents at all
[4:13:08] <+misterfistor> while true, i dont trust children with telekinesis or godlike power
[4:13:09] <+justianxix> just tell the parents they are "force sensitive"
[4:13:12] <jebus_the_methman> @PlagueOfGripes well if you're some famer from bumfuck Tatooine you can't argue with a religious cult of space samurai
[4:13:12] <SuperVaderMan> I was under the impression that it's a consensual thing? I might be misremembering
[4:13:21] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> But what are they going to do if they aren't?
[4:13:22] <rosemon5001> nahh its pretty much your serving the galaxy by giving up your child
[4:13:25] <$SilverRoddo> The Jedi took my baby away 🎶
[4:13:31] <jbournehd> master ouba nuba
[4:13:31] <+InhumanMilitia> got opinions on grey jedi Plague?
[4:13:34] <Habblewater> "GGEZ Master"
[4:13:35] <$doomp12> take it, Palpatine won't allow space abortions anyway
[4:13:38] <Snirtax> Okay to be fair if you were a poor as shit farmer wouldn't you want your kid to be a supermonk ?
[4:13:40] <+Zerodyne90> who really killed owen and beru
[4:13:41] <jebus_the_methman> also bein a jedi is a way better fate for some aliens than a sex slave to a hutt like a lot of twi'leks have
[4:13:55] <+justianxix> and their boys?
[4:13:57] <Habblewater> Oh that's fun
[4:14:03] <jebus_the_methman> Jannissary's are a good example, they were also slave soldiers drafted from the balkans
[4:14:09] <+Fatemaster> We need your kid, please take these coupons to Applebees as reimbursement.
[4:14:12] <ChoculaUltra> Caligula lived a hard life :(
[4:14:34] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> The Aristocrats?
[4:14:38] <kvassimoto> The unborn are the most oppressed
[4:14:42] <Triblade1992> Nero Cladius: "UMU"
[4:14:43] <Habblewater> Like when Nero had a guy killed with seafood for no reason
[4:14:52] <ChoculaUltra> Cal is like "oh, gripes is going on about the rape and killing again is he? I'll wait." LUL
[4:15:02] <+misterfistor> This partys getting crazy
[4:15:11] <SuperVaderMan> I wonder if the Jedi tell the families about it whenever their kid dies doing some stupid Jedi thing? Like "Yeah sorry, your kid died in an ice cave trying to get a crystal, they weren't worthy I guess"
[4:15:28] <Wynzler> They probably blame the sith
[4:15:28] <+bitstorm_> poor younglings 😢
[4:15:32] <Triblade1992> and now Nero Claduis is the one who sings "Padoru" and "UMU" thanks to the Fate series.
[4:15:34] <Wynzler> "Some bad guy got to him"
[4:15:38] <kiwicoffin> It's hard to argue with "We have god powers and so does your kid. Do not stand in the way."
[4:15:38] <Hoot_Patoots> "I'll get him guys !"
[4:15:43] <Twad_Feu> not just adopt kid, they probably "helpfully" jedi-hand-wave any objections away
[4:15:56] <ChoculaUltra> "uh, your son was killed...by the dark side! Yeah that's it. The dark side got him in the caves, my condolences."

[4:16:37] <kiwicoffin> That trooper had psychology degree. He knows what makes Cal tick
[4:16:43] <Triblade1992> bye!

[4:17:19] <Triblade1992> BYE
[4:17:27] <Hoot_Patoots> a jedi's strongest force power is slapstick
[4:17:29] <mortelkilll> id say its still abduction if your parents consent
[4:17:33] <+PerrinIsDead> I always knew I’d fall to my deeeaaaaaaaaathhhhhhh
[4:17:41] <mortelkilll> yo ucan even be abducted by your own parents
[4:17:44] <jbournehd> Unessential is such a weird thing to say to make someone feel bad
[4:17:49] <+HorribleHog> force mind control is such shite as such an easy action
[4:17:50] <cap_bon> the old gypsy woman was right I would fall to my death
[4:18:10] <Wynzler> She has another eye-dea
[4:18:14] <+misterfistor> yes thats how you typically feel the later you get into a metroidvania
[4:18:23] <jbournehd> I can hear her big eyes when she speak
[4:18:29] <+PerrinIsDead> That god damn gypsyyyyyy ahhhhhhhh still falling you guys

[4:18:49] <Maids4lyfe> just got here, what difficult is plague playing on?
[4:18:51] <jebus_the_methman> sadly as soon as the combats start to be funny, the game is practically over
[4:18:58] <rytisone> plip plop, eyes out
[4:18:59] <mortelkilll> is her eyes bad animatio nor just how the actor eyes look?
[4:19:00] <Habblewater> Could you use the force to defeat erectile dysfunction?
[4:19:03] <LordSDB> Many children most likely drowned here
[4:19:10] <kiwicoffin> Her eyes are no longer on speaking terms
[4:19:11] <SuperVaderMan> She's actually two tiny sentient eyeballs piloting a flesh robot
[4:19:12] <+HorribleHog> mortelkilll probably
[4:19:13] <$SilverRoddo> He’s not a huge coward. I feel like we’ve grown.
[4:19:17] <jbournehd> her eyes never close
[4:19:18] <Maids4lyfe> that's a sith power @Habblewater
[4:19:20] <ChrisM341> My primary school teach had bigger eyes
[4:19:28] <SquigglyLizard> use the force to put cere's eyes back in minigame when
[4:19:30] <ChrisM341> not teacher, Principal
[4:19:30] <ChoculaUltra> nah, the kids definitely froze to death slowly. Possibly on par with the horrors of drowning to death.
[4:19:43] <+PerrinIsDead> Y’all have a kid in school who could make his eyes pop out of the sockets a little bit?
[4:19:55] <Hoot_Patoots> oh i love those scout droids
[4:19:56] <$doomp12> her eyelids haven't closed ever in her life, only withdraw further into her skull

[4:21:42] <cap_bon> when am I gonna get a star wars game were enemies get cut apart like their in fist of the north star fighting rei
[4:21:54] <kiwicoffin> Yeah the perfect dodge has little utility with the window for it
[4:22:08] <jbournehd> Why call more than one star destroyer
[4:22:18] <jbournehd> why call star destroyer at all
[4:23:07] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Ever play Bayonetta, Plague?
[4:23:09] <mortelkilll> dodging is about not being in the way of a weapon when it strike
[4:23:16] <+misterfistor> you can do both, but the dodge-at-last-second has extra benefits
[4:23:17] <+Bearzone> when it's well made perfect dodge feel good though
[4:23:18] <Habblewater> @cap_bon Maybe it'll get modded in? I got the same experience with 1000% dismemberment mods in Witcher 3
[4:23:18] <mortelkilll> not about becoming magically invinsible the moment it hit
[4:23:31] <canisdyluna> a pink one, YES!

[4:24:05] <$SilverRoddo> I thought he was going to Neo fly.
[4:24:06] <%Samex_Comex> Why can't you use the pancho to glide
[4:24:07] <rytisone> the prettiest princess jedi
[4:24:07] <Maids4lyfe> ponchos are universal, they're not appropriation
[4:24:17] <Hoot_Patoots> hey pink isp retty good
[4:24:27] <+askalta> it matches your sword bro
[4:24:28] <+misterfistor> pretty cancerous lot
[4:24:31] <ChrisM341> Nah, the force will break the fall.... and his legs... and spine
[4:24:34] <mortelkilll> its only dumb if you are ashamed
[4:24:36] <kiwicoffin> I'm surprised the force isn't used for things like gliding and whatnot
[4:24:39] <mortelkilll> wear that pink with pride
[4:24:41] <kvassimoto> LUL
[4:24:52] <jbournehd> Only the maliest men can wear pink
[4:24:53] <Maids4lyfe> only the sith use the force for cool shit
[4:25:03] <Hoot_Patoots> it mostly sucks nothing really match, but if you could change your clothes underneath to like a darker purple or magenta, that pink would rock
[4:25:13] <OminousBagel> Men in pink? How bizarre!
[4:25:17] <cap_bon> they could be anywhere
[4:25:24] <Wynzler> AT-STs!
[4:25:28] <mortelkilll> yeah not being able to match the rest of the clothes make it suck
[4:25:33] <ChoculaUltra> I guarantee you - all the wacky shit you want the force to be used for has definitely happened in the Old Republic timeline. You had Sith masters quad wielding blades using the force and shit.

[4:25:55] <jbournehd> "Ahhh I've left my oven on"
[4:25:57] <Cyral_Drive> reminder that they drop freaking bombs at their own feet
[4:26:12] <Habblewater> ST's ripped my flesh

[4:26:28] <Lelfro> can't beat this flamingo
[4:26:31] <mortelkilll> they really could have just gave them a stomp instead of a stupid bomb attack
[4:26:33] <+eanscrale> This is the goofiest thing ever
[4:26:35] <i_am_therydon> at-st's have really thin legs. a lightsaber should easily cut a foot off.
[4:26:45] <Exadata_> the legs are so thin, they should break in one hit

[4:27:40] <SquigglyLizard> how do these thing just not fall over?
[4:27:47] <mortelkilll> at least its not as bad as the at at design
[4:27:47] <kiwicoffin> Now go kiss the pilots

[4:30:21] <jebus_the_methman> you gotta find witch waifu again
[4:30:24] <+Zerodyne90> his master
[4:30:26] <ChoculaUltra> couldn't a Jedi/SIth just use the force to launch a pebble at the speed of a blaster shot/bullet? Just Force Snipe these assholes.
[4:30:29] <kiwicoffin> Back to Dathomir: Grey Jedi and Grey-er Waifu
[4:30:33] <+Zerodyne90> or the weird dude, rather
[4:30:36] <Wynzler> Her eyes will never be ready to see the past

[4:30:47] <+Zerodyne90> I keep forgetting about that other dude
[4:30:54] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[4:31:04] <mortelkilll> i thin kthe point is that he must overcome his guilt
[4:31:09] <SinnerBeta> trials of the boner
[4:31:11] <Lelfro> confront yourself, get out of the closet, pink boy
[4:31:18] <Hoot_Patoots> i do like this ship

[4:31:31] <Hoot_Patoots> (which were my favourite)

[4:32:08] <SinnerBeta> good color coordination
[4:32:13] <rytisone> "I return...with pink powers"
[4:32:15] <Hoot_Patoots> pink works well with this enviro
[4:32:23] <Triblade1992> They got stronger. They went through a training arc
[4:32:26] <Habblewater> What the fuck are those?
[4:32:34] <+bitstorm_> MAybe they are immune to pink
[4:32:34] <mortelkilll> pink camouflage
[4:32:38] <Wynzler> The timeskip made them stronger
[4:32:40] <jbournehd> Cal, the Pink Ranger
[4:32:43] <kerotuyu> They've gone hollow
[4:32:55] <Hoot_Patoots> AAAAAA
[4:32:55] <Wynzler> Because any time the player character isn't around, time stops for them
[4:32:56] <SinnerBeta> *sekiro
[4:32:58] <A_High_Ordinator> They must have some really strong clothes to survive a lightsaber

[4:33:30] <mortelkilll> there nothing to explain they just exist
[4:33:33] <Habblewater> Are those supposed to be Nightsisters?
[4:33:38] <mortelkilll> yeah
[4:33:41] <Maids4lyfe> nightsister zombies
[4:33:44] <mortelkilll> resurected by one of the living one

[4:41:15] <TardigradeRex> T hey live there LUL
[4:41:15] <SinnerBeta> the back entrance
[4:41:18] <Lelfro> when you weren't looking
[4:41:20] <Twad_Feu> they must be magic jedi, or the janitor crew
[4:41:20] <+Lifes_A_Lich> They heard you talking to yourself and came running LUL
[4:41:21] <redrix_3> because yes
[4:41:21] <Pechugaman> THE FORCE
[4:41:23] <+HorribleHog> the hole in the ceiling
[4:41:23] <Maids4lyfe> because they have a back door
[4:41:24] <kiwicoffin> The witch teleported them there
[4:41:26] <Savior127> through a vent
[4:41:26] <Triblade1992> and there is the Dathomir guys
[4:41:26] <canisdyluna> what did just we learn?
[4:41:27] <Pechugaman> THE FORCE WANTS THEM IN THERE
[4:41:27] <+HorribleHog> have you learned nothing?
[4:41:28] <+eanscrale> Reasons
[4:41:28] <rytisone> the BACK entrance
[4:41:33] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:41:33] <jebus_the_methman> the evil Jedi locked himself in with them
[4:41:39] <JoshTheFace> thats so dumb
[4:41:39] <Triblade1992> The back entrance
[4:41:41] <+Remery_> Look like Barakas
[4:41:41] <Lelfro> they triple jumped into there
[4:41:49] <+BuriasDempsey> wasn't it opened before by the other guy before you showed up?
[4:41:59] <hereticalzed2> I figure crazy man and the brothers were able to pass through the door because they don't have the same baggage that Cal does.
[4:42:06] <hereticalzed2> They're attuned to the Dark Side enough or whatever.
[4:42:06] <SinnerBeta> imagine living in a cave when suddenly one of the walls opens and an asshole with a lightsaber runs into your house
[4:42:23] <Habblewater> Darth Maul Party CAve
[4:42:28] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @hereticalzed2 You must be this emotionally well adjusted to pass.
[4:42:37] <hereticalzed2> Guess so
[4:42:45] <LordSDB> I think it circle around to it
[4:42:50] <jbournehd> CURSED
[4:42:56] <PowerfulBlackGangs> !CURSED!
[4:43:07] <rytisone> they can teleport
[4:43:12] <Wynzler> Yeah
[4:43:17] <Wynzler> The zeffo were assholes
[4:43:41] <kiwicoffin> Spoiler: Malicos doesn't use any of her magick
[4:43:45] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> PowerUpL CurseLit PowerUpR
[4:43:45] <mortelkilll> against the jedi which killed them
[4:43:52] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Except Ventress.
[4:44:03] <SinnerBeta> magic should not be a thing in star wars
[4:44:03] <WarchiefGoldva> We need one creepy goth GF in this game, after all.
[4:44:04] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Prety sure it was Greivous and Dooku.
[4:44:05] <Maids4lyfe> they were killed off by Grievous but they thought Grievous was a jedi
[4:44:08] <MorWakaWaka> arent the nightsisters super hardcore? Why does this one sound so whiny?
[4:44:11] <jebus_the_methman> the zeffo are like the elders from xcom, but they weren't really good at their "ein reich, ein humanity" plan
[4:44:12] <Wynzler> He killed their leader and massacred the rest
[4:44:15] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @Maids4lyfe Makes sense.
[4:44:15] <mortelkilll> they probably wont commit to the jedi killing them
[4:44:16] <aeravon> There were Nightsisters in Force Unleashed
[4:44:17] <Twad_Feu> probably with orbital bombardment magic
[4:44:26] <SuperVaderMan> force teleportation LUL
[4:44:28] <whirly25> Grievous personal slashed em
[4:44:29] <aeravon> And force unleashed takes place after this
[4:44:39] <mortelkilll> hobo just chilling in the back
[4:44:44] <SinnerBeta> do you want some ginger dick gurl?
[4:44:50] <+Zerodyne90> babukuBlush
[4:44:58] <Cyral_Drive> It suits her more
[4:45:01] <mortelkilll> you were not
[4:45:03] <+askalta> it kinda matches her more than you
[4:45:03] <ArcaneMonk> I'm glad to see the texture popin is just as fuckign bad for other people
[4:45:05] <ChrisM341> Pink Poncho gives you Jedi powers
[4:45:08] <Triblade1992> Discount Jorus C'Boath
[4:45:12] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Here necromancer lady, take my only weapon
[4:45:13] <WarchiefGoldva> Why does Cal talk with his head cocked all the time?
[4:45:28] <%JJCheeker> Kill him kill him
[4:45:33] <Wynzler> Was it Vader?
[4:45:34] <+fattness132> Grievous does
[4:45:36] <auhsojnala> old republic jedi do
[4:45:36] <Goergorion> Vader
[4:45:37] <jbournehd> Sadness incoming
[4:45:37] <Triblade1992> Inquisitor
[4:45:39] <cap_bon> what makes you a jedi is tiny amoeba in your blood that dictate fate
[4:45:42] <jbournehd> can you feel it
[4:45:43] <MorWakaWaka> this nightsister looks boring as hell
[4:45:52] <+bitstorm_> "having a lightsabre doesn't make you a jedi"?
[4:45:59] <kiwicoffin> Because you've run like a pussy
[4:46:06] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I mean he was dumb enough to hand her his only weapon
[4:46:07] <Triblade1992> Maybe he hid the fact that he was a Jedi?
[4:46:13] <+HorribleHog> "I ended with the jedi because they're shit"
[4:46:17] <ArcaneMonk> because plot
[4:46:20] <SinnerBeta> she's fascinated by his pink poncho
[4:46:25] <Wynzler> Has BD always had that eye popping out of his head or did cere's disease infect him too?
[4:46:25] <Nenatab> The pink cloak caught her offguard.
[4:46:28] <Exadata_> I thought none jedi couldn't use lighsabers
[4:46:29] <mortelkilll> malico waiting like a baller
[4:46:29] <Habblewater> Oooh, magic poncho
[4:46:31] <MorWakaWaka> ugh so cliche
[4:46:41] <OminousBagel> Not the younglings!!!
[4:46:42] <+bitstorm_> younglings 😢
[4:46:44] <jbournehd> Younglings
[4:46:49] <Hoot_Patoots> "Ah Cal you have co...oh okay you're just gonna go there then"
[4:46:56] <Triblade1992> Malacos is just Discount Jorus C'Boath. It's annoying
[4:47:04] <SinnerBeta> I don't, fuck magic in SW
[4:47:05] <WarchiefGoldva> It'd be a waste to lose our goth GFs, after all.
[4:47:18] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Talking about sects
[4:47:19] <mortelkilll> the force is magic already
[4:47:21] <+HorribleHog> Yes, it's refreshing just for the variance
[4:47:27] <+Zerodyne90> I keep hearing force sensitive sex
[4:47:34] <OminousBagel> Me too
[4:47:35] <Wynzler> You mean like the zeffo
[4:47:36] <Goergorion> Boos arena
[4:47:40] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> There was the one that had the people who really like Jar-Jar.
[4:47:42] <SinnerBeta> fuck it, lets talk about Whills
[4:47:44] <rytisone> tottaly not aboss arena
[4:47:46] <MorWakaWaka> the nightsisters were cool.
[4:47:51] <+HorribleHog> they have that blind guy in Rogue One
[4:47:51] <cap_bon> I love the idea of jedi-sith wars being called Jedi Civil wars because why would normal people care
[4:47:53] <+eanscrale> He was "Meditating"
[4:48:04] <%JJCheeker> It's darth geralt
[4:48:14] <SinnerBeta> he's a pretty chill dark jedi
[4:48:25] <kiwicoffin> It's power by committee
[4:48:32] <Triblade1992> WOW, he was actually right
[4:48:40] <ChoculaUltra> sorry I stepped away for a smoke - is this guy Cal's master?
[4:48:40] <OminousBagel> Why you booing? He right!
[4:48:40] <MorWakaWaka> stop mansplaining
[4:48:43] <Cyral_Drive> True, but also wrong
[4:48:45] <Lelfro> talk no jutsu
[4:48:45] <SinnerBeta> nobody's ever gone
[4:48:45] <rytisone> Never be game over

[4:50:04] <ChoculaUltra> the flat no was so fucking insulting too, I'd grab the sabers too
[4:50:04] <redrix_3> hes an anime protag
[4:50:08] <MorWakaWaka> You ever notice how the reasoning of shounen heroes often come off as insane?
[4:50:08] <%JJCheeker> I really don't like this main character
[4:50:08] <herfaintsmile> lol didnt even think about it for a single second
[4:50:10] <+Zerodyne90> No. rooSmug SantaHat
[4:50:11] <Triblade1992> At least Jorus C'Boath wanted to restore the Jedi Order in the vein of the Dark Side. That at least made him WRONG
[4:50:11] <OminousBagel> Star Wars with good writing? Naaaah
[4:50:13] <+bitstorm_> all the good guys in this are shit
[4:50:17] <+Jaysky> No ur cute
[4:50:22] <+eanscrale> Da Ordah doh
[4:50:27] <mortelkilll> this would have been visually much better if he had jedi lightsabers
[4:50:28] <A_High_Ordinator> Same-colour duel lightsabers :/
[4:50:32] <rytisone> I hope you like draining stamina for a few hits
[4:50:34] <%Samex_Comex> Oh it's the hobo
[4:50:36] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Can't be a cuck if you forgo physical attachment entirely.
[4:50:36] <mortelkilll> really show that he is a corrupted jedi
[4:50:42] <%JJCheeker> Whoever wrote the dialogue is ewww
[4:50:55] <jebus_the_methman> @PlagueOfGripes to be fair, Jedis are the biggest pseudo intellectual "pacifist" cucks imaginable, he's simply parroting the mantra that has been passed down for millenia
[4:50:58] <+HorribleHog> what's the point of a health bar if it just fills when you empty it?
[4:51:06] <mortelkilll> its a starmina bar
[4:51:08] <jbournehd> this smack talk just doesnt have enough punch
[4:51:10] <+HorribleHog> ooh
[4:51:14] <+Lifes_A_Lich> He really doesn't look difficult
[4:51:14] <BillieNoMates> All these guys are such massive chumps that a single failed padawan manages to ruin them
[4:51:30] <BillieNoMates> Not even a super clone like Starkiller or a Skywalker
[4:51:37] <+Lifes_A_Lich> He's kinda just doing a ton of dumb unga bunga moves
[4:51:46] <+HorribleHog> what's the point of a stamina bar if it just fills to the brim when it depletes
[4:51:50] <Exadata_> it bothers me that lightsabers aren't one hit kills
[4:51:53] <mortelkilll> star wars isnt self aware
[4:51:55] <Habblewater> Peaceful ways by force
[4:51:57] <whirly25> You do not know da wae
[4:51:57] <herfaintsmile> b-but its not about power tho!!
[4:52:01] <+eanscrale> I thought it was to impress his goth crush
[4:52:05] <kiwicoffin> He's in the way, but Merrin could take you right past this asshole
[4:52:06] <Triblade1992> At least Jorus C'Boath didn't use Lightsabers like what Sidous was like BEFORE the prequels
[4:52:10] <Exadata_> yeah but no
[4:52:11] <Snirtax> This is literally the dumbest though, it shows everything wrong about the jedi, the inability to compromise on anything is what got them in this mess in the first place !
[4:52:17] <+Jaysky> You callin him short?
[4:52:17] <+HorribleHog> star wars was self aware, they just backed down super hard
[4:52:23] <%Samex_Comex> He's throwing rocks!
[4:52:24] <+k95zero> You have a dash attack
[4:52:29] <Cyral_Drive> He slaughtered the natives in their own homes too
[4:52:31] <TardigradeRex> Should just build a 30 foot lightsaber.
[4:52:36] <jbournehd> KISSSS MEEEEE
[4:52:43] <skelfae> Dark souls was a terrible choice for a Jedi game
[4:52:51] <Big_Dream> he mean cal is a padawan he has no real mastery
[4:52:52] <ChrisM341> Dodging won't save you
[4:52:58] <+Jaysky> You're a padawan you suck at stamina
[4:53:06] <jbournehd> Hit me up fam
[4:53:07] <redrix_3> i wonder if the double ended saber has more range
[4:53:26] <Exadata_> dodging wont save you on this souls game
[4:53:27] <ArcaneMonk> if you parry him, you can disrupt his combo
[4:53:33] <kiwicoffin> This is THE parry fight
[4:53:38] <shevan123> kill me you bing bong
[4:53:41] <Savior127> @PlagueOfGripes he's a parry check boss.
[4:53:53] <+Jaysky> Is this Gwyn?
[4:53:53] <LittleBigQuebec> wpouldnt jedis and ex-jedi know that juming is usualy the worst thing you can do in a 1v1 lightsaber duel?
[4:53:57] <PowerfulBlackGangs> But why won't dodging save you?
[4:54:02] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I really hate that stupid jump move where he just slams his two sabers down. He's supposed to be good at fighting and he's acting like a caveman LUL
[4:54:18] <mentok12> snap
[4:54:20] <jbournehd> The good guy won
[4:54:26] <kiwicoffin> Cal just isn't a snappy fighter
[4:54:27] <Twad_Feu> damage sponge bosses are a drag
[4:54:28] <MorWakaWaka> For a long time I've wondered why million dollar projects like this have such cheap stupid writing. Recently I figured out its not incompetence. It's because they think the audience is stupid and so the write accordingly.
[4:54:31] <CripDaNips> This game good?
[4:54:37] <Triblade1992> I hate how this guy is discount Jorus C'Boath without understanding what Zahn was writing
[4:54:46] <ChrisM341> Sekiro, Jedi dies twice
[4:54:53] <OminousBagel> @MorWakaWaka But the audience IS mostly stupid.
[4:55:03] <+HorribleHog> MorWakaWaka it's because they can get away with it since you can't refund a product you've played through
[4:55:11] <redrix_3> i love how every time you break his block to hurt him he flies away and voids your effort
[4:55:17] <LittleBigQuebec> just 4Head
[4:55:19] <MorWakaWaka> It's true.
[4:55:20] <mortelkilll> are we part of the stupid ones?
[4:55:38] <+k95zero> You can force pull when the enemy is red to disrupt them.
[4:55:53] <kiwicoffin> Did Cordova try to suck his own dick?
[4:56:01] <MorWakaWaka> I'm often suprised when things that seem to be universally panned actually made alot of money.
[4:56:02] <WarchiefGoldva> A man's power grows the more of his nipples he's showing.
[4:56:24] <+Jaysky> Parry terry larry
[4:56:27] <ArcaneMonk> I hate how the "holding your xp" glow overrides the unblockable attack glow
[4:56:34] <+eanscrale> Worked for Samurai Jack
[4:57:13] <bear_breaker20> why does EA still get peoples money
[4:57:19] <+Lifes_A_Lich> "You see padawan? I have instant blocks!"
[4:57:19] <cap_bon> Lets make a boss fight were you block for 90% of it
[4:57:33] <+eanscrale> So Sekiro then
[4:57:35] <%hgtarras> Why is the boss fight like this ? You only get two hits.
[4:57:38] <+Jaysky> Because people want their sports games, and they have the money to advertise shit
[4:57:39] <mortelkilll> he has way too much health for being a block centered boss
[4:57:40] <%hgtarras> Wtf is that
[4:57:42] <+HorribleHog> oh i left my guard open spinning my lightsaber to taunt? never mind just have it warp back in my hand when you attack me
[4:57:45] <MorWakaWaka> @Lifes_A_Lich EA plays the game at a level we can't comprehend
[4:57:48] <SolidusA> Hit him once ,slower second time spinning attack third for maximum DMG
[4:57:54] <kiwicoffin> EA will feel justified only releasing FIFA if I don't support this game
[4:57:55] <Wynzler> @bear_breaker20 I bought the game because I was worried if it didnt sell well enough EA would use it as an excuse to continue with their lootbox based bullshit
[4:57:58] <Goergorion> No forward momentum to his attacks
[4:58:09] <+k95zero> @PlagueOfGripes you have a dash attack and you can force pull to disrupt his red attacks. You got options bro
[4:58:12] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @MorWakaWaka His unga bunga technique too strong
[4:58:25] <+Jaysky> I mean the studio making this game is pretty solid
[4:58:44] <%JJCheeker> "Better hurry it's going to blow"
[4:58:47] <jebus_the_methman> don't worry Plague, from now on all Boss fights will be the same bullshit
[4:58:58] <mortelkilll> god there more of this?
[4:59:00] <cap_bon> "god this sucks" yeah thats the feeling you want to create inside your players
[4:59:02] <bear_breaker20> @Wynzler theyre gonna keep up infinte revenue gambling boxes amyway i feel
[4:59:15] <%hgtarras> That stamina thing is dumb
[4:59:19] <ArcaneMonk> it's just like Sekiro! Except bad!
[4:59:34] <bear_breaker20> even if we vote with our wallets
[4:59:35] <%JJCheeker> Very bad
[4:59:36] <+Jaysky> This ain't like Sekiro
[4:59:43] <mortelkilll> in sekiro you make the fights go faster my blocking
[4:59:45] <jebus_the_methman> after Malicos there are two bosses who both use even bigger bullshit tactics
[4:59:45] <ChrisM341> Star Wars: Dodging won't save you
[4:59:50] <SolidusA> Took 5 hours on hardest difficulty ,its hard
[4:59:50] <Cyral_Drive> This is some lidl Sekiro
[4:59:52] <jbournehd> "You are a bad gameplayer"
[4:59:53] <MorWakaWaka> they know what they're doing @bear_breaker20
[4:59:56] <%hgtarras> This is terrible boss design. Why did people give respawn praise for this
[4:59:59] <redrix_3> maybe if you ask him politely he might just bend over for you
[5:00:12] <jebus_the_methman> but thank god one of them you need only to hurt him for 25% of his HP
[5:00:13] <mortelkilll> to be fair this fight at least have some character
[5:00:24] <mortelkilll> hes a guy we at least know a bit
[5:00:28] <mortelkilll> even if very little
[5:00:33] <OminousBagel> Shame the magic wasn't blue so you could say she blue balled him
[5:00:33] <bear_breaker20> @MorWakaWaka they know what they WANT LUL
[5:00:35] <ArcaneMonk> I feel like the AT-ST was the best boss in this game, and that's fuckign sad
[5:00:38] <kiwicoffin> She's "helping"
[5:00:39] <+Jaysky> Witch gf?
[5:00:39] <MorWakaWaka> Yoda!... oh its some lady
[5:00:43] <SolidusA> Cow Testis
[5:00:47] <%JJCheeker> Oh my God this music is such a ripoff of Avengers
[5:00:52] <+WaywardSera> wait she's on our side now? since when?
[5:01:04] <mortelkilll> since we decided to fight maliko i guess
[5:01:11] <mortelkilll> im not even sure why we are fighting
[5:01:14] <Maids4lyfe> since the last cutscene
[5:01:15] <+eanscrale> So, just like a real lightsaber duel
[5:01:17] <%hgtarras> @jjcheeker those 3 sounds at the end. Were blatant
[5:01:22] <ironwill_mne> stich use it
[5:01:23] <MorWakaWaka> @bear_breaker20 they want money and they know how to get it. I wish I knew how too.
[5:01:25] <LittleBigQuebec> do you think Malicos uses that line in bed a lot?
[5:01:25] <%JJCheeker> Indeed
[5:01:27] <mortelkilll> they had a disagreement abotu what the new jedi should be so now they fight to the death i guess
[5:01:31] <+Jaysky> This fight is good :)
[5:01:33] <LittleBigQuebec> "oh you're a quick one"
[5:01:33] <canisdyluna> good thing you have a warlock on your side ^^
[5:01:39] <Cyral_Drive> This is the best fight of all time :)
[5:01:40] <SuperVaderMan> We're fighting him because he has red lightsabers, so that makes him the bad guy
[5:01:45] <+eanscrale> Oh wow, it's worse than sekiro
[5:01:46] <t_dawg_bro> this fight is good :)
[5:01:47] <kiwicoffin> I love his face when he's losing the test of strength
[5:01:50] <rytisone> very good
[5:01:51] <mortelkilll> ill admit the fight doesnt look bad when yo uarent playign it
[5:01:55] <%hgtarras> The stamina thing is sooo bad
[5:01:58] <mortelkilll> hes entertaining to watch
[5:02:03] <MorWakaWaka> Is this the final boss?
[5:02:07] <jebus_the_methman> @mortelkilll all bossfights in this game are complete bullshit
[5:02:08] <Maids4lyfe> no
[5:02:09] <+Zerodyne90> nno
[5:02:09] <Big_Dream> no
[5:02:18] <t_dawg_bro> LUL
[5:02:19] <Lapinelis> I lowered the difficulty here, cause honestly, I didn't give enough a fuck and just wanted him dead
[5:02:20] <MorWakaWaka> NOOOOOOO
[5:02:20] <ArcaneMonk> when a shirtless dude with ritual scarring talks to you about ideologies, I guess you're just obligated to fight him
[5:02:22] <%Violated_Muffins> @PlagueOfGripes use two normal attacks then the split attack when you break his guard
[5:02:27] <mortelkilll> i was just saying it was fu nto watch
[5:02:29] <Maids4lyfe> you can force push it
[5:02:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> So dodging *will* save you
[5:02:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> his face LUL
[5:02:36] <kiwicoffin> "NO NO NO"
[5:02:37] <Habblewater> Evil Santa
[5:02:39] <t_dawg_bro> missed
[5:02:39] <ironwill_mne> stich
[5:02:42] <+xGreenflame> Twink and his goth girlfriend get bullied by local boomer
[5:02:44] <ironwill_mne> use it
[5:02:44] <%hgtarras> @violated_muffins is that the most damage he’ll be able to do?
[5:02:49] <+bitstorm_> time for pee pee
[5:02:49] <+StreamStopA> more qte's plx
[5:02:50] <redrix_3> nice
[5:02:51] <rytisone> rage piss
[5:02:52] <ChrisM341> Now for a word from our sponsors
[5:02:53] <+k95zero> Plague knows he has options right?
[5:02:55] <%JJCheeker> I am so glad I skipped out on this game
[5:02:57] <i_am_therydon> you can force push the rocks your just not timing it right.
[5:03:06] <bear_breaker20> high tier boss disrespect*
[5:03:12] <Triblade1992> His design just reminds me of Jorus C'Boath but it's all wrong, Jorus was an evil wizard and didn't use lightsabers
[5:03:21] <MorWakaWaka> Use the force Plague. Hack your save for infintie health.
[5:03:22] <bear_breaker20> just get and go shit
[5:03:26] <bear_breaker20> up*
[5:03:28] <redrix_3> starts furiously pissing like a pressure washer
[5:03:31] <kuningaskamari> You can just dodge the rocks
[5:03:34] <Triblade1992> He followed the logic of Palpatine before the prequels
[5:03:35] <ArcaneMonk> god, the lightsaber duels could have been cool, but this one and the last one were just heinous
[5:03:35] <%Violated_Muffins> @hgtarras no idea. but from what im seeing after the third hit the boss pushes you away and the split attack confirms all its damage with the opening hit
[5:03:39] <ChrisM341> Use the Force Harry - Gandalf
[5:03:42] <%hgtarras> @jjcheeker i bought it for $45. Still have not played it yet. Still taking my time with outer worlds
[5:03:51] <%hgtarras> Thats actually a good idea
[5:03:53] <ArcaneMonk> the last fucking boss
[5:03:56] <ArcaneMonk> just summons ads
[5:04:00] <+bitstorm_> when he goes for a pee pee I put my headphone on to see if I can hear
[5:04:09] <kiwicoffin> He's gonna hate the final boss too
[5:04:11] <SolidusA> what difficulty does Plague play ?
[5:04:16] <%JJCheeker> Yeah outerworld looks like fun
[5:04:39] <redrix_3> what kinda animals do you have then?
[5:04:43] <%hgtarras> Gamepass for a $1 is worth it in my opinion
[5:05:07] <%Samex_Comex> Rocks!
[5:05:18] <+bitstorm_> lol
[5:05:24] <StealthlessFox> Hey all, how is Plague enjoying Star Souls?
[5:05:26] <jebus_the_methman> outerworlds is only good if you enjoy the most shallow rp experience you could ever have
[5:05:29] <ArcaneMonk> go do the qtes again, lol
[5:05:35] <StealthlessFox> Oh that awnsers that question...
[5:06:01] <kiwicoffin> There's no really being "better" than the boss. You have to play his game to score hits
[5:06:04] <ironwill_mne> use stich more offen
[5:06:07] <ChrisM341> I wont let you escape - Dead Guy
[5:06:09] <deadstrat> I havent got Outer Worlds, because I wait for the pc release. Is t not worth it?
[5:06:16] <+SoleilAstier> you have options man, force pull the red attacks
[5:06:21] <+Lifes_A_Lich> The slow ass pathway
[5:06:23] <+k95zero> "No room for creativity" hasn't tried new abilities or attacks he has unlocked like his DASH ATTACK
[5:06:23] <mortelkilll> its good, peopel are just beign edgy
[5:06:34] <+k95zero> or force pull the red attacks
[5:06:36] <redrix_3> if the check poimt could be just slightly forward that would be great
[5:06:37] <+HorribleHog> It seems pretty shallow
[5:06:38] <StealthlessFox> "You must be this thin to fight Taron Malicos" That's what that passage is for
[5:06:42] <ArcaneMonk> this game often feels like loading areas so you can go to them and load the next area
[5:06:48] <+HorribleHog> combat is trivial in Outer Worlds
[5:06:50] <OminousBagel> @deadstrat It's okay but if you looking for New Vegas 2 it's not it.
[5:06:51] <jbees7> outerworlds starts really great and after that is just ok
[5:06:57] <MorWakaWaka> I'd have laughed so hard if he fell off at the bridge.
[5:07:00] <bear_breaker20> vegan only boss fight
[5:07:06] <kiwicoffin> I think Plague is conditioned to hold onto his force powers since it runs out in normal combat
[5:07:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> !uptime
[5:07:14] <@Nightbot> 5 hours 7 minutes 24 seconds
[5:07:40] <+HorribleHog> I love the story though, i'd pay 20 bucks for it
[5:07:41] <+k95zero> @kiwicoffin fair but he still has a gap closer he isn't using
[5:07:52] <SolidusA> when you see him spread arms hit block
[5:07:54] <ArcaneMonk> why is malicos safe on taunt when the final boss isn't?
[5:07:54] <+Punishedkaiger> Heal
[5:07:55] <twistedj3ster> Aww I was hoping you'd be ripping the game apart for it's bugs, but you're fighting the coolest dude
[5:08:04] <deadstrat> @OminousBagel mmh thats a shame, New Vegas was my favorite Obsidian game
[5:08:07] <MorWakaWaka> They probably shouldn't have characters talk during gameplay at all. It always gets annoying
[5:08:07] <Murphio_GS> Old man sith
[5:08:19] <+k95zero> AYE
[5:08:22] <+k95zero> he used the dash
[5:08:33] <bear_breaker20> anyone else just put to sleep when lightsabers dont act like revengeance blade mode
[5:08:37] <OminousBagel> @deadstrat It's kinda like comparing Apples to Oranges really. It's an okay game and it has the Obisidan writing that everyone loves, but the gameplay is... eh
[5:08:38] <Savior127> wait a second this isnt Nioh 2!
[5:08:43] <ChrisM341> I brought New Vegas last month and I'm really enjoying it (my first fallout game)
[5:08:53] <Murphio_GS> I love that whoever this guy is is duel wielding
[5:08:55] <%Samex_Comex> He has force spinning
[5:08:57] <mortelkilll> dont buy outer worlds for the gameplay
[5:08:58] <StealthlessFox> Boy this guys.....sure is taking lightsabre attacks well considering he is shirtless. Abs of Adamantium on the dark side I guess.
[5:09:04] <mortelkilll> but the rwriting is pretty fu nand very toothy
[5:09:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[5:09:13] <t_dawg_bro> F
[5:09:14] <+bitstorm_> NotLikeThis
[5:09:14] <kiwicoffin> Cal LUL
[5:09:20] <Triblade1992> stinking Jorus C'Boath knockoff
[5:09:25] <redrix_3> PixelBob
[5:09:27] <+k95zero> He has so many options
[5:09:29] <MorWakaWaka> @Savior127 Played Nioh recently. Really made me apreciate the souls games.
[5:09:40] <jebus_the_methman> @OminousBagel that writing is not even that good, it's very preachy and one sided in favor of anti corporation
[5:10:00] <+HorribleHog> I mean corporations are awful
[5:10:01] <redrix_3> or the holy god game hollow knight
[5:10:07] <MorWakaWaka> Corporations aren't inherently evil. Humans are though.
[5:10:09] <%JJCheeker> They really should have put the meditation circle in this room
[5:10:10] <%Violated_Muffins> you can always stop and do a drawing stream! ;P
[5:10:14] <mortelkilll> its a corporation dystopia, what did you expect?
[5:10:16] <ArcaneMonk> old man nipples are lightsaber resistant
[5:10:16] <jebus_the_methman> which is an anthesis of obsidian since they loved to be grey
[5:10:26] <mortelkilll> its still pretty grey
[5:10:32] <bear_breaker20> corporate media is always the first to denounce coporate lmao
[5:10:42] <mortelkilll> its not liek the people within the struckture are all evil but the system itself is broken and corrupt
[5:10:52] <mortelkilll> and the game does show that
[5:10:57] <Triblade1992> WOW, it made things quicker
[5:10:59] <redrix_3> double blade op
[5:11:07] <+Lifes_A_Lich> It looks like it's breaking his guard faster
[5:11:09] <SolidusA> you have 3 hits when you brake his guard hit im hard
[5:11:13] <+k95zero> WOW, trying something else gave a different result!
[5:11:24] <LordSDB> kills his block meter better at least
[5:11:26] <+HorribleHog> bear_breaker20 HahaThink "corporations are bad, but *we're* hip and cool and totally with you"
[5:11:28] <Habblewater> nooo
[5:11:48] <%JJCheeker> No he's using force shield to protect from the light Saber Kappa
[5:11:50] <kelvinvicstein> Hey
[5:11:54] <LordSDB> so you could switch between blocking double bladed then go to dual for extra damage
[5:11:57] <MorWakaWaka> The main character looks so uncomfortable in that pause menu.
[5:11:57] <jebus_the_methman> also it feels really empty and there are not enough quests, the *capitalÜ of the whole colony is 3 alleyways with 5 buildings and 3 quests (outside of the MQ)
[5:12:07] <ChrisM341> So Blocking won't help, and Dodging won't Save you... Kappa
[5:12:10] <Triblade1992> wow
[5:12:16] <cap_bon> are you feeling it now mr plague
[5:12:19] <+Lifes_A_Lich> "It's no use!"
[5:12:21] <bear_breaker20> "our blacks at xbox are loved " ... @HorribleHog
[5:12:23] <MorWakaWaka> go do some sidequests for a while
[5:12:24] <Savior127> Im pretty sure you can parry him mid combo
[5:12:30] <+k95zero> Definition of insanity
[5:12:42] <%Violated_Muffins> MUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDAMUDA
[5:12:42] <SolidusA> when you lower his health he does it
[5:12:44] <+HorribleHog> bear_breaker20 yikes forever!
[5:12:48] <Murphio_GS> F
[5:12:59] <+k95zero> Big F
[5:13:05] <ChrisM341> What if this game had DMC combat?
[5:13:07] <MorWakaWaka> Can't you just run past those fools?
[5:13:09] <Murphio_GS> Wait are these guys Zebrak?
[5:13:13] <Hoanui> but its like dark souls doesn't that mean it's good?
[5:13:15] <OminousBagel> @ChrisM341 With the music. Yes.
[5:13:18] <redrix_3> above average sized F
[5:13:24] <bear_breaker20> look that one up lol it was thing xbox tried not too long ago lol
[5:13:30] <%Violated_Muffins> its more like Sekiro than DS
[5:13:34] <MorWakaWaka> IN dark souls you can just run past everyone
[5:13:39] <geekjacob> you could just ignore them
[5:13:48] <ChrisM341> @ominousbagel lol I kinda wanna see that now, we already got Kylo Ren in DMCV
[5:13:50] <+StreamStopA> Why the fuck was anyone comparing this game to dark souls?
[5:13:50] <+HorribleHog> Luckily we have Jedi Outcast and even Jedi Academy FeelsGoodMan
[5:13:52] <%JJCheeker> You have way more options in Dark Souls then you doing this game
[5:13:58] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nice!
[5:14:00] <ArcaneMonk> sadly, you cant enter the crawl crack if they're nearby
[5:14:05] <Savior127> they really tried to replicate Sekiro's combat without understanding how or why it worked.
[5:14:13] <t_dawg_bro> gotta hit that split saber attack
[5:14:14] <+k95zero> He has options, he just isn't using them
[5:14:18] <Twad_Feu> lightsabers are known to be unable to pierce exposed abs
[5:14:21] <Lapinelis> I wish a slash was a kill
[5:14:28] <StealthlessFox> Just leave the area and backstab him for one of his health bars when he stops looking for you Kappa
[5:14:32] <mortelkilll> sekiro combat mostly work because of the focus on stealth and how breaking posture was a free kill
[5:14:44] <mortelkilll> in many bosses, breakign posture was the way to a quick kill
[5:14:51] <jebus_the_methman> @Savior127 that's basically the game in a nutshell "copying the premises of other games withouth understanding what made them good"
[5:14:52] <MorWakaWaka> @Twad_Feu yeah shouldn't everyone die in one hit? that's be badass.
[5:14:53] <twistedj3ster> And suddenly ALL his stamina comes back!
[5:14:54] <SuperVaderMan> "I've survived worse" he says as he's taking multiple lightsaber strikes to his bare chest
[5:15:12] <%Violated_Muffins> yes you can
[5:15:15] <+Emberwake> Force push the rocks
[5:15:16] <+HorribleHog> in outcast one of the combatants would be quartered by now
[5:15:16] <+InhumanMilitia> this is why they dont talk in dark souls he wont stfu and fight
[5:15:17] <mortelkilll> its hard to make a game where everythign die in one hit balanced
[5:15:18] <Lapinelis> @SuperVaderMan I mean, he's pretty resistant to it.
[5:15:21] <jbees7> its not stamina its a block meter
[5:15:25] <t_dawg_bro> or force dash to him
[5:15:31] <+k95zero> I can taste the tilt
[5:15:40] <+bitstorm_> can you do a slow motion on the rocks
[5:15:43] <mortelkilll> but yeah yodu expect lightsaber to pack more of a punch
[5:15:57] <cap_bon> why are we fighting again
[5:15:58] <ArcaneMonk> plague could stand to play a little more aggresively
[5:15:59] <ironwill_mne> stich man
[5:16:04] <StealthlessFox> Wait what difficulty is Plague on, current situation considered?
[5:16:04] <redrix_3> some guy said you can force push those rocks back at him
[5:16:10] <Savior127> In all honesty, this feels more like a indie Unity game than anything else
[5:16:11] <bear_breaker20> "kids love the taste of tilt, plague doesnt see why!"
[5:16:12] <Big_Dream> you can
[5:16:12] <mortelkilll> @cap_bon slight disagreement on what the new jedis should be like
[5:16:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> do you rike it?
[5:16:22] <t_dawg_bro> you get the split saber move for a reason monkaHmm
[5:16:25] <ArcaneMonk> they're fighting because the game needs a boss fight
[5:16:27] <cap_bon> Ok but why cant you have jedi and what ever this guy wants
[5:16:33] <Twad_Feu> why the fight? because evil/communication fail
[5:16:37] <mortelkilll> because jedis are control freak
[5:16:41] <twistedj3ster> yeah, the rocks hit you before you can get a push out
[5:16:45] <%Violated_Muffins> "ONLY COWARDS RUN" proceeds to back up
[5:16:46] <OlmStranger> wait what was that ghost thing
[5:16:46] <mortelkilll> its their way or nothing
[5:16:48] <SolidusA> command are unresponsive thats what sucks
[5:16:50] <rytisone> it's more reliable to dodge the rocks
[5:17:04] <redrix_3> 10/10 dps
[5:17:07] <Virokwet> then get him with one heavy
[5:17:12] <%Violated_Muffins> FORCE PUSH THE ROCKS
[5:17:12] <+Emberwake> Sucks to suck
[5:17:16] <Daxalog> Are you suing your full moveset? Is their something your missing?
[5:17:25] <ArcaneMonk> did anyone say to slow them?
[5:17:29] <+k95zero> No lol
[5:17:30] <cap_bon> just dig up
[5:17:36] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[5:17:37] <twistedj3ster> one guy
[5:17:47] <+bitstorm_> i asked if slow works, can't say ive ever played the game tho
[5:17:47] <mortelkilll> its hard to read chat while fighting a ninja hobo
[5:17:50] <SolidusA> got em
[5:17:52] <ChrisM341> I recall some people having a similar complaint with yakuza bosses (two hits before they block everything else)
[5:18:04] <chronoxgp> so this is def better than code vein?
[5:18:05] <Twad_Feu> she could throw rocks at him at least
[5:18:09] <+Punishedkaiger> You can interrupt him if you use quick push
[5:18:10] <mortelkilll> yakuzah combat doesnt feel good when the ennemeis and bosses block
[5:18:21] <%JJCheeker> It looks so goofy when you block with a double bladed light Saber
[5:18:34] <Daxalog> Itd be neat if you got a button that called her in to do a move that hindered him. Maybe a cooldown timer with it
[5:18:39] <SquigglyLizard> LUL
[5:18:42] <+Emberwake> I cant figure out why you are using dual saber in a boss fight. Dual saber is for deflects and crowds
[5:18:42] <ArcaneMonk> wait hang on, does plague use the quick push/pull at all? I only see him use the ong ones
[5:18:43] <MorWakaWaka> I like that this is a nice round arena. I hated in souls games when I'd get stuck on level geometry.
[5:18:44] <Lapinelis> I can just feel the irritation in Plagues voice
[5:18:45] <SolidusA> resets block meter :)
[5:18:54] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Ninja hobos. protonLOL protonRyu
[5:19:04] <jbees7> i found the y. y. combo most reliable on bosses
[5:19:08] <Savior127> He has that "forget about that shit. Here comes Mongo!" face
[5:19:08] <ChrisM341> Yakuza doesn't have the best combat but I still enjoy it a bit. granted each game has its bullshit bosses and Yakuza 4 has one most annoying bosses I in my opinion
[5:19:18] <%JJCheeker> I don't get why the robot just doesn't stab you with it
[5:19:18] <chronoxgp> use the crack
[5:19:19] <+Lifes_A_Lich> LUL
[5:19:19] <Daxalog> Push
[5:19:20] <+k95zero> That tasty tasty tilt
[5:19:21] <+Emberwake> yy is for when their guard drops. It eats their health meter
[5:19:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> is plague underleveled?
[5:19:24] <Daxalog> POOSH
[5:19:28] <+HorribleHog> JJCheeker When they're clashing and he's using the double-bladed like a single the other blade is probably in his crotch off camera
[5:19:31] <redrix_3> 2-3 more of those and you're done
[5:19:31] <cap_bon> remember Kiryu never killed anyone
[5:19:31] <SolidusA> he spaming it
[5:19:34] <mortelkilll> @MorWakaWaka coudl argue taht its to oartifcially nice and round, its mroe realistic to get inconveneint geometry and not a "boss arena"
[5:19:34] <TardigradeRex> I think Plauge is about the join the dark side. LUL
[5:19:36] <kelvinvicstein> BibleThump
[5:19:39] <+Zerodyne90> WutFace

[5:19:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[5:19:49] <LordSDB> she wiffed the haoken
[5:19:54] <ArcaneMonk> she fucking missed
[5:19:55] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @TardigradeRex You mean he wasn't already?
[5:20:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay!
[5:20:03] <Virokwet> eyyyy
[5:20:05] <+Zerodyne90> nice
[5:20:11] <StealthlessFox> And then she steals your kill
[5:20:12] <ArcaneMonk> WHY COULDNT SHE DO THAT BEFORE
[5:20:14] <ChrisM341> Enchantress
[5:20:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> kill steal
[5:20:17] <SuperVaderMan> Look, she's using her Force imprisonment technique
[5:20:17] <Twad_Feu> last hit

[5:20:26] <+Lifes_A_Lich> She uh...earth bended him
[5:20:31] <SolidusA> what is a man ?
[5:20:34] <Phob05> neat
[5:20:35] <TardigradeRex> @Gabriel_Wright_Dunn It's clouded. :P
[5:20:40] <Habblewater> LUL
[5:20:42] <+StreamStopA> she missed 3 attacks then she kill seals what a bitch
[5:20:46] <ArcaneMonk> a boss fight that ends like a wet fart
[5:20:46] <rytisone> you..did it
[5:20:56] <MorWakaWaka> his head should be sticking out of the ground so you can kick it
[5:21:02] <OlmStranger> So he's uh, just buried alive right there?
[5:21:03] <+Jaysky> What a good fight :)
[5:21:03] <+bitstorm_> an exotic waifu as reward?
[5:21:06] <mistermastergreg> was it hard for the sake of being hard?
[5:21:22] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:21:26] <Twad_Feu> a pointless fight, really. He cold have stayed there and do his thing and no one would ever care.
[5:21:26] <cap_bon> mission accomplished we killed a man other our slight difference ideology
[5:21:27] <ChrisM341> Star Wars by M Night Shymalan
[5:21:28] <TardigradeRex> He got a timeout
[5:21:37] <+Jaysky> Goth gf
[5:21:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gib succ
[5:21:50] <+bitstorm_> a paedo list
[5:21:53] <ArcaneMonk> now you can get random fucking force artifact #48, indistinguishable from any other macguffin/mystic artifact in anything ever
[5:21:55] <+MaddyCaddy> That was completely unsatisfying.
[5:22:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> she just believed him
[5:22:03] <+MaddyCaddy> What a shitty segment
[5:22:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> like that
[5:22:05] <Sapphire_Breeze> just like that
[5:22:18] <+InhumanMilitia> why would the force child map be up to date?
[5:22:26] <%JJCheeker> Never trust a ginger
[5:22:28] <MorWakaWaka> Shouldn't a nightsister look really fucked up?
[5:22:35] <SuperVaderMan> Yeah how old would that list be by now?
[5:22:38] <GarrisonWaifu> Awwww she called you by your first name only
[5:22:39] <+Lifes_A_Lich> It looked like she was raising her hand up to smoke a cig
[5:22:40] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Now touch her butt
[5:22:44] <StealthlessFox> Space Russia with its kill stealing witches
[5:22:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the empire is hunting down all gingers
[5:23:03] <Twad_Feu> to be fair, her only social stuff was undead monsters, an idiot, and a whole bunch of uneducated dudes on a hell planet
[5:23:09] <Daxalog> Are gingers force sensative by default?
[5:23:11] <+HorribleHog> Giger on the walls
[5:23:25] <geekjacob> kill all the jadi
[5:23:28] <+Jaysky> He does
[5:23:30] <mortelkilll> he was a dictator, thats kinda it
[5:23:30] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Because he wanted power.
[5:23:33] <Twad_Feu> Sidious isnt even good at ruling the galaxy either
[5:23:33] <MorWakaWaka> because hjes the bad guy
[5:23:33] <%JJCheeker> The final thing that we know ends up being nothing
[5:23:36] <Cyral_Drive> something something unlimited power
[5:23:39] <jbees7> because george thought that was cool
[5:23:39] <Murphio_GS> Because EEEEVILLll
[5:23:41] <rytisone> he wanted unlimited power
[5:23:42] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Amass power
[5:23:43] <Sapphire_Breeze> because he had the red lightsaber
[5:23:48] <jebus_the_methman> are we talking expanded universe or post disney star wars?
[5:23:48] <cap_bon> wasnt it to prepare the galaxy against some aliens from another galaxy or some bullshit in the eu
[5:23:53] <+HorribleHog> He wanted peace under human rule
[5:23:54] <mortelkilll> because nazi imagery
[5:23:57] <%JJCheeker> Sounds like a boring life
[5:23:58] <+Jaysky> A control freak
[5:23:58] <Lapinelis> I kinda wish a sith took power and was actually good
[5:23:58] <grander76> i love democracy i love the republic
[5:23:59] <StealthlessFox> With the galaxy unde rhis control he could eat entire planets of like....people energy or something
[5:23:59] <redrix_3> rate this game so far out of 10 plague
[5:23:59] <+StreamStopA> yes put something in her oven
[5:24:00] <Twad_Feu> So Sidious could stroke his Dork Side Ego
[5:24:03] <deadstrat> Some people really like that
[5:24:04] <geekjacob> because space nazi
[5:24:09] <MorWakaWaka> He doesn't have to do shit. THats why he rules the galaxy
[5:24:10] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Because the strong must subjugate the weak is the Sith mentality.
[5:24:10] <Savior127> I always thought it was to search for Immortality from his original intention and leading the Empire will help him
[5:24:12] <+eanscrale> So I can have other people suffer through my parental insecurities
[5:24:25] <ChrisM341> VERGIL?
[5:24:30] <TardigradeRex> Isn't that what a whole lot of people do IRL as well?
[5:24:39] <geekjacob> true
[5:24:39] <kelvinvicstein> BibleThump
[5:24:41] <%JJCheeker> I guess the emperor didn't want force power he wanted political power
[5:24:49] <+HorribleHog> The emperor just wanted to yuck it up, Sidious was a bad interpretation of the original character
[5:24:50] <mortelkilll> thats odd, beign to omuch into the dark side make yo ulose yoru emotions?
[5:25:01] <MorWakaWaka> you lack vision plague
[5:25:04] <geekjacob> power for power sake
[5:25:05] <cap_bon> sounds a bit like the Warp
[5:25:10] <+Jaysky> He's a power addict
[5:25:12] <+bitstorm_> EEEEVVUUUUULLL
[5:25:22] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Was that not the point?
[5:25:24] <+HorribleHog> But he LOVED it he was really pleased
[5:25:24] <%Samex_Comex> I get to feel things
[5:25:24] <+Remery_> Evil taste like chicken :)
[5:25:25] <GarrisonWaifu> Why give it to her?
[5:25:25] <Cyral_Drive> "k"
[5:25:25] <Savior127> So it wasnt to search for immortality then?
[5:25:25] <ArcaneMonk> god, I hate intangible forces of evil for this very reason
[5:25:29] <GarrisonWaifu> KISS
[5:25:30] <+eanscrale> Power is dope man
[5:25:30] <geekjacob> crushes it
[5:25:30] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Yeah, but you gotta think Star Wars was meant to be an adventure romp
[5:25:32] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> He's drunk on the dark side.
[5:25:35] <deadstrat> Why does she care
[5:25:35] <SuperVaderMan> ???

[5:25:50] <MorWakaWaka> werent the nightsisters bald?
[5:25:53] <Sapphire_Breeze> "lets make a new generation together"
[5:25:54] <ArcaneMonk> "and why should I care?"
[5:26:07] <SuperVaderMan> "I was alone for a long time" meanwhile Prauf is fucking dead
[5:26:14] <jbees7> knock up and lock up
[5:26:15] <geekjacob> calm down prof harkin

[5:27:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> she want the ginger dicc
[5:27:32] <TardigradeRex> That's the thing, people get addicted to money, power or whatever at some stage. When they have figured out that getting more of the particular thing makes them feel "good", they will just keep trying to get more of it to get "that feeling" again. Not everyone goes through some kind of awakening at some point and realises they are just "feel good" junkies for the particular thing they once learnt they enjoyed.
[5:27:32] <MorWakaWaka> @mistermastergreg I really can't stand how boring woman look in mainstream media

[5:29:13] <ArcaneMonk> hey wanna fight two of these pices of shit at once?
[5:29:20] <Lapinelis> If goblins wasn't supposed to be "star wars comic relief" he might actually be a good character
[5:29:37] <geekjacob> have tried the heros way of running away
[5:30:07] <MorWakaWaka> Be careful Plague. THe last checkpoint is before the Malico fight
[5:30:12] <ArcaneMonk> has plague done the arena fight yet?
[5:30:16] <jbees7> goblin has its moments
[5:30:27] <$doomp12> fun biology fact, your legs have to be longer than your arms to leap long distances
[5:30:36] <PowerfulBlackGangs> She watches them shower
[5:30:41] <deadstrat> She sounds so apathetic
[5:30:46] <Sapphire_Breeze> she can just teleport
[5:30:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> this seems to be a good trick
[5:30:53] <SuperVaderMan> "Btw sorry for resurrecting all my sisters into zombies to try and claw your face off, no hard feelings OK?"
[5:30:56] <%Violated_Muffins> and she knows where the ship is how?
[5:31:15] <cap_bon> she used her quin chi power
[5:31:22] <+TQuick101> he ghost body is probably just following you
[5:31:24] <+TQuick101> her*
[5:31:25] <rytisone> Report to the ship as soon as possible, we'll bang ok?
[5:31:32] <mortelkilll> she doesnt have much to work with to be fair
[5:31:35] <ChrisM341> Like Raven?
[5:31:42] <mortelkilll> hard to give personality to that character
[5:31:42] <Sapphire_Breeze> black Diablos PogChamp
[5:31:43] <+HorribleHog> I know, she sounds perfect!
[5:31:45] <jebus_the_methman> that's just the whole game @PlagueOfGripes
[5:31:46] <+HorribleHog> Kappa
[5:31:51] <+StreamStopA> She had tits and was nearby.
[5:31:54] <Twad_Feu> she sounds very formal, like someone used to living at the royal court or something
[5:31:58] <Snirtax> You can just say picked for her ethnicity you know. It ain't racist or anything
[5:32:04] <i_am_therydon> you get to fight the extra annoying version!
[5:32:11] <Snirtax> I don't think that's it though
[5:32:21] <MorWakaWaka> Wouldn't it be great if you had to fight on a monsters giant erect penis? Now thats good game design.
[5:32:23] <jebus_the_methman> fun fact, they recasted the protagonist after disney said that they couldn't have another female SW protagonist that might steal the show from Rey
[5:32:26] <mortelkilll> we cant be sure but thats possible. dont think she s been that much worse than anyoen else i nthe game trough
[5:32:28] <+HorribleHog> If they wanted to explain it they could say she's used to speaking a non-common language of the sisters
[5:32:45] <+HorribleHog> and speaking common is foreign to her
[5:33:05] <ChrisM341> No fun allowed
[5:33:06] <+HorribleHog> they could make that a character trait and have cal explain stuff to her
[5:33:09] <Rodzzila> That a polite way of saying she was hired only for brownie points, even through the VA sucks? LUL
[5:33:16] <Cyral_Drive> It's not a very good power fantasy
[5:33:18] <MorWakaWaka> @jebus_the_methman they should just make the main character a weird alien. That sidesteps the issue all together
[5:33:21] <Lapinelis> Games have a serious problem of forcing balance in the way of having fun.
[5:33:23] <$doomp12> great work fighting Nyack alpha, now fight the version with horns
[5:33:24] <+Wurmspawn> I take it he never learned the quick kill on those berserker creatures.
[5:33:45] <redrix_3> can we get big tittied bd art?
[5:33:57] <SuperVaderMan> "Hey Nightsister chick, can you tell your bros to fuck off?"
[5:34:00] <ArcaneMonk> welcome to goverment mandated wallrunnign zone
[5:34:06] <SuperVaderMan> WAIT why are the zombies still attacking you?? LUL
[5:34:06] <Cyral_Drive> Couldn't goth gf tell them to fuck off
[5:34:06] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> rekt
[5:34:09] <jbees7> @Wurmspawn what is the quick way?
[5:34:10] <+HorribleHog> redrix_3 she doesn't have enough fur Kappa
[5:34:12] <StealthlessFox> Wait why are her sisters still trying to kill you?
[5:34:16] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Wait you're friends with the witch lady why are her zombies still attacking you?
[5:34:19] <MorWakaWaka> Chat, What star wars alien would you want to play as?
[5:34:31] <jebus_the_methman> @MorWakaWaka i find that the actor for Cal did a really good job for the mediocre script he had to work with, unlike the rest of the actors
[5:34:33] <mortelkilll> sebulba
[5:34:38] <canisdyluna> is she not their leader ...
[5:34:39] <ArcaneMonk> gime a game where I can play as a hutt
[5:34:40] <geekjacob> remember when general grevios came too this plant
[5:34:48] <A_High_Ordinator> Miraluka
[5:34:49] <Lapinelis> whatever the hell jabba the hut is.
[5:34:50] <deadstrat> Kit Fisto
[5:34:54] <Lapinelis> I want to play that
[5:34:57] <ChrisM341> I don't know star wars well enough to pick a race to be
[5:34:59] <StealthlessFox> @MorWakaWaka That one with the asscheeks for a mouth in the cantina in the first star wars
[5:34:59] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Walk the Dinosaur
[5:34:59] <mortelkilll> think they re just called hut
[5:35:03] <+Wurmspawn> @jbees7 If you parry his jumping charge precisely and then parry the next 2 strikes, you get a quick kill prompt.
[5:35:09] <ChrisM341> KOTOR
[5:35:10] <+eanscrale> Yeah same
[5:35:13] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> @Lapinelis You mean a hutt?
[5:35:19] <Lapinelis> Sure
[5:35:19] <%Violated_Muffins> BUT HE'S JOKER FROM GOTHAM!!!
[5:35:20] <Lapinelis> That.
[5:35:23] <MorWakaWaka> I would be a Greedo
[5:35:23] <rytisone> it is
[5:35:25] <VolticSurgeSA> @MorWakaWaka Probably a Trandoshan because they're just a race of cartoonish assholes and that's a fun character concept
[5:35:28] <Twad_Feu> under shirt
[5:35:29] <%Violated_Muffins> ISNT THAT COOL!!
[5:35:33] <SuperVaderMan> Wowee, your undershirt a slightly different color now
[5:35:35] <ChrisM341> Also he's that kid from Malcom In The Middle
[5:35:39] <+bitstorm_> I will be the force
[5:35:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> nani
[5:35:51] <mortelkilll> yoda race would be cool
[5:35:52] <ArcaneMonk> change the clothes under the poncho
[5:35:55] <dot_theory> Boganoff
[5:36:00] <jbees7> @Wurmspawn Ithough that was just when you deplete his block bar
[5:36:01] <+HorribleHog> it's cheaper to have one voice on a character
[5:36:10] <cap_bon> create a character so you could have 2 goth GF on the ship PogChamp
[5:36:13] <Big_Dream> the vine
[5:36:17] <$jobbedbone> the finest sweatpants you can find in a sith mall
[5:36:17] <Big_Dream> on the side
[5:36:17] <MorWakaWaka> I wouldn't mind being a Gungan
[5:36:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> branch?
[5:36:23] <Big_Dream> no
[5:36:29] <Lapinelis> Plague how long do you plan on playing this? Beating the game today?
[5:36:31] <+HorribleHog> MorWakaWaka misikaHHA
[5:36:31] <Big_Dream> the little pne
[5:36:39] <redrix_3> leap if faith?
[5:36:49] <VolticSurgeSA> I also wouldn't mind being an Ithorian because the idea of a space hippy Jedi is funny to me
[5:36:49] <Cyral_Drive> It's a branch you walk on
[5:36:49] <SuperVaderMan> small vine there yeah
[5:36:50] <Virokwet> theres a vine to walk on
[5:36:52] <A_High_Ordinator> Quality collision
[5:36:54] <Big_Dream> the small one
[5:36:57] <+SoleilAstier> small vine
[5:36:57] <Twad_Feu> vine
[5:36:59] <%Violated_Muffins> RED HERRING
[5:37:01] <jbees7> small vine as a rope
[5:37:01] <Big_Dream> the small vine
[5:37:03] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the little branch?
[5:37:04] <rytisone> c'mon, it's obvious
[5:37:10] <MorWakaWaka> @HorribleHog I'd be pretty cool as long as I kept my mouth shut.
[5:37:19] <+SoleilAstier> .... wow Eli
[5:37:24] <ironwill_mne> u can walk
[5:37:28] <ironwill_mne> on brench
[5:38:02] <+HorribleHog> MorWakaWaka eh, crab eyes don't do it for me
[5:38:29] <mortelkilll> well yeah they put super weak ennemeis to make you feel stronk
[5:38:38] <mortelkilll> the nthe normal ennemies come back and the combat shit again
[5:38:41] <Big_Dream> i hope the game play improves in the next one but this was a good start
[5:38:52] <VolticSurgeSA> Of course I'd rather be a Mandalorian than a Jedi, because they haven't been totally ruined by Disney. Yet
[5:38:52] <Lapinelis> At this point in time, I hated the game somewhat. I just b-lined to the exit.
[5:39:05] <hereticalzed2> Yeah I didn't bother doing more exploration after this
[5:39:07] <+HorribleHog> MorWakaWaka now being a Watto
[5:39:11] <mortelkilll> its the kidn of game where the frustration just pile up over time
[5:39:14] <+HorribleHog> there's a character
[5:39:16] <hereticalzed2> It's not like there's anything to find besides more ponchos
[5:39:20] <mortelkilll> and you hate it more the farther in you get
[5:39:26] <jbees7> yeah same I even missed that stim pack
[5:39:46] <MorWakaWaka> What if bobba fett turned out to be Jar Jar Binks all along. That would of been really funny.
[5:39:59] <GaspidarIII> hey Eli, any other games youre interested streaming in the up incoming year?
[5:39:59] <$jmackkz> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100
[5:40:01] <jmackkz> jmackkz's Cheer shared rewards to 3 others in Chat! 
[5:40:03] <redrix_3> oh no not the angered foreskin munchers
[5:40:05] <VolticSurgeSA> Basically I'd be any Star War race besides boring white ginger man
[5:40:24] <mortelkilll> it does get abit annoying how anthropocentrist sci-fi and fantasy are
[5:40:28] <+HorribleHog> Misa hed hort... Big bad sarlacc stinkabreath swallow whole!
[5:40:37] <Lapinelis> That's the good bit about basic bitch stormtroopers, they fucking die
[5:40:44] <ChrisM341> Gonna play story or try online?
[5:40:48] <PowerfulBlackGangs> You should play Dynasty Warriors games
[5:40:52] <VolticSurgeSA> Like I'd totally play a game where you play as some weird alien like a Quarren
[5:41:08] <A_High_Ordinator> Fight poison with poison
[5:41:20] <redrix_3> we met 5 mins ago after murdering an old man shes cool
[5:41:28] <+Lifes_A_Lich> starB She's cute though so it's all ok
[5:41:28] <deadstrat> Cal : Im trying to get laid, dont ruin this for me guys.
[5:41:29] <Rodzzila> This game looks mediocre at best, but because is not completely trash and a Star Wars game people are blowing it out of proportion
[5:41:32] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:41:47] <spyder_casual> best girl just join the ship?
[5:41:47] <rytisone> finally, someone who doesn't understand them
[5:41:48] <GarrisonWaifu> Finally! Someone in this damn universe that dosnt speak droid
[5:41:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i cant understand your accent. do you speak american?
[5:41:51] <mortelkilll> lets just go to the next level
[5:41:59] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @Rodzzila I mean it really isn't that bad
[5:42:03] <Cyral_Drive> good talk
[5:42:10] <Daxalog> Hes spitting facts
[5:42:21] <MorWakaWaka> "I have a razor on board so now we can shave her head. Her head of hair dishonors the nightmother."
[5:42:24] <+bitstorm_> honestly don't get this choice of NPCs they're all just unpleasant
[5:42:26] <hereticalzed2> Bogano
[5:42:36] <Cyral_Drive> not much
[5:42:36] <jmackkz> not much
[5:42:39] <rytisone> you got the thing for the thing
[5:42:40] <+StreamStopA> I recommend fling into the sun
[5:42:43] <hereticalzed2> You have like two more levels
[5:42:52] <OminousBagel> @bitstorm_ Star Wars has a habit lately of having unlikeable characters.,
[5:42:52] <jebus_the_methman> 1-2 hours
[5:42:55] <$doomp12> 2 planets then done
[5:42:56] <Virokwet> your entering the final strech
[5:43:02] <jbees7> she kinda loses her accent here
[5:43:03] <jebus_the_methman> maybe 30 mins if you're quick
[5:43:16] <%Samex_Comex> There is a whole planet full of Greez
[5:43:17] <i_am_therydon> your at the 5/6th mark I think.
[5:43:20] <Rodzzila> @Lifes_A_Lich I'm not saying is bad, just ok. But all I hear is how amazing it is! gonna wait for a good sale probably
[5:43:26] <TardigradeRex> Presents NotLikeThis
[5:43:37] <mortelkilll> they are trying pretty hard with horrid goblin man
[5:43:41] <mortelkilll> i dislike him the least
[5:43:50] <OlmStranger> So is that the rare beyblade?
[5:43:55] <Daxalog> Would you eat Scazz meat
[5:43:55] <MorWakaWaka> Everyone watch Mandalorian? Pretty good.
[5:43:56] <+Lifes_A_Lich> @Rodzzila It's not 60$ good, but a sale price probably would be worth it.
[5:44:09] <hereticalzed2> I never got what Greez's stake in all this was
[5:44:13] <%JJCheeker> Hey didn't care for the fourth and fifth episode
[5:44:15] <hereticalzed2> Cere just hired him right?
[5:44:16] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Something a sure man would say.
[5:44:21] <deadstrat> MMHH
[5:44:23] <redrix_3> so why does that danny davito looking alien hate cal so much?
[5:44:23] <PowerfulBlackGangs> They are already being hunted
[5:44:24] <rytisone> she smart
[5:44:27] <chronoxgp> lol
[5:44:29] <%JJCheeker> i*
[5:44:30] <mortelkilll> lets destroy that darn list
[5:44:34] <spyder_casual> get the raid can, jesus
[5:44:37] <%Samex_Comex> O.O
[5:44:46] <Cyral_Drive> O_O
[5:44:51] <LordSDB> Im glad she's in the crew now
[5:44:55] <suikudo> Her eyes are eternally exploding out of her face
[5:44:58] <ChrisM341> That's hot
[5:44:59] <mortelkilll> yeah she has some nice dynamics
[5:45:06] <mortelkilll> her flat delivery kinda work
[5:45:06] <+king_wragles> Eyes bigger than her stomach
[5:45:07] <%JJCheeker> She used to do that a lot on mad TV
[5:45:16] <jebus_the_methman> at first i though space gremlin betrayed the crew and goth gf saw trought that
[5:45:20] <+HorribleHog> The huge wing seems a little... inconvenient
[5:45:20] <spyder_casual> not even nightsister?
[5:45:21] <+king_wragles> No really, her eyes are really fucking big
[5:45:22] <TardigradeRex> I can respect a woman that takes her steaks rare tho... LUL
[5:45:24] <LordSDB> I met enough people with eye's like her so Im use to her eyes.
[5:45:24] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Goth lady is alright
[5:45:29] <jebus_the_methman> but nope that would require good writing
[5:45:32] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Disney Star Wars in a nutsheel
[5:45:33] <StealthlessFox> Not even Goth GF Second Sister?
[5:45:35] <mortelkilll> its a weird kidn of hate
[5:45:38] <Cyral_Drive> Goth gf is not bad rest are lame
[5:45:38] <+bitstorm_> they are all repulsive in some way
[5:45:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> distant chonk
[5:45:42] <redrix_3> how dare you hate danny davito
[5:45:42] <%JJCheeker> I really don't like cal
[5:45:42] <+InhumanMilitia> she looks like winston warrior cat
[5:45:44] <+HaunchPaunch> You're basically in love with them then
[5:45:45] <ChrisM341> They're Tolerable
[5:45:45] <%Samex_Comex> Poor Greez
[5:45:46] <mortelkilll> hes the most unlikeable but hes the most memorable
[5:45:50] <TakesGuts> lol
[5:45:53] <+eanscrale> That sounds like a starwars story to me
[5:45:57] <%JJCheeker> The robot is fine
[5:45:59] <+king_wragles> @PlagueOfGripes They're background characters you're forced to focus on. At least that's how I feel.
[5:46:00] <chronoxgp> they look like walmart shoppers/employees
[5:46:22] <chronoxgp> goth chick from hot topic
[5:46:26] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Well she comes from a place that's all red and brown
[5:46:28] <The_500lb_Child> Why does she look like a DBZ character?
[5:46:28] <Twad_Feu> I'd expect her to be interested in all the greenery and such
[5:46:31] <Big_Dream> screw jedi scew sith give the grey jedi
[5:46:35] <spyder_casual> BEST GIRL THE SMORTEST
[5:46:39] <suikudo> Its star wars
[5:46:40] <suikudo> thats why
[5:46:45] <MorWakaWaka> @JJCheeker the show kind of loses it's "moral grey area" tone there. I'm still enjoying it myself
[5:46:51] <TardigradeRex> @The_500lb_Child I feel like she might bring spiders at any time! LUL
[5:46:51] <+HorribleHog> This is character development at light speed
[5:46:54] <+eanscrale> Dey gonna get dah cron
[5:47:17] <chronoxgp> I didn't notice cal was wearing a pink shirt until now
[5:47:19] <%Samex_Comex> Uh oh the rats
[5:47:21] <mortelkilll> game is close but not quite on the level of realizing the jedis are kind of bad
[5:47:23] <Big_Dream> jedi and sith are both dumb
[5:47:27] <+Lifes_A_Lich> I kinda wish bug eyed lady was t-posing in the back
[5:47:30] <LordSDB> Aren't you suppose to get to choose what you do in this game?
[5:47:30] <+HorribleHog> They don't need jedi until they crush their parents skulls during a tantrum
[5:47:33] <ChrisM341> Cue Maximillian running back into his room
[5:47:34] <+Lifes_A_Lich> just randomly
[5:47:38] <jmackkz> jarring cutscene time!
[5:47:40] <+StreamStopA> fuck it
[5:47:43] <redrix_3> god damn it
[5:47:50] <Habblewater> don't do it plague
[5:47:55] <GarrisonWaifu> Here video game player, have a cute thing
[5:47:56] <+OmegaWeltall> huh... i never did that
[5:47:58] <+bitstorm_> that's not a boglin
[5:47:59] <+zero_g_toad> cere is modeled after the actress who voices her, so you're just making fun of that woman
[5:47:59] <+HorribleHog> Oh no...
[5:48:01] <ChrisM341> It's a Pokemon. Catch it
[5:48:05] <+SWindleFeD> I mean it's not like the thing already had a home
[5:48:05] <+HorribleHog> Do not lewd the bogling
[5:48:07] <Habblewater> Get on my ship slave
[5:48:09] <rytisone> the secret
[5:48:14] <Cyral_Drive> @zero_g_toad Not really they didn't model her correctly
[5:48:15] <jmackkz> theres a health vial down there too
[5:48:18] <jbees7> you missed something plague
[5:48:27] <LordSDB> Hey plague do you not get any choice on what side you play in this?
[5:48:43] <spyder_casual> no choices on good or bad
[5:48:44] <Big_Dream> nope your another brain washed jedi
[5:48:48] <hereticalzed2> Cal's character is set in stone pretty much
[5:48:56] <MorWakaWaka> this guys poncho looks ridiculous.
[5:49:00] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> remembers that this is Plague of "Not a Furry/Dragonball Channel" Gripes.
[5:49:03] <hereticalzed2> Wayfarer is the only way
[5:49:07] <+eanscrale> They just make you a jedi anyway
[5:49:20] <+HorribleHog> Kotor was pretty good though
[5:49:30] <+bitstorm_> lol
[5:49:31] <TardigradeRex> Isn't that the same thing? :D
[5:49:35] <redrix_3> babies are worth double xp
[5:49:35] <Murphio_GS> EVERY BABY
[5:49:37] <+eanscrale> Powah is dope
[5:49:44] <ChrisM341> Was the 2nd Force Unleashed good?
[5:49:52] <MorWakaWaka> I like they tried to make the force more neutral in Last Jedi.
[5:49:52] <StealthlessFox> Your choices are heal the mans leg or DEVOUR HIS COCK
[5:50:00] <+eanscrale> gotta get that baby juice
[5:50:01] <+HorribleHog> Remember force running at the speed of sanic?
[5:50:09] <Big_Dream> yeah and grab a vine
[5:50:12] <%JJCheeker> What's comical about wanting to murder every baby to give power to yourself? Kappa
[5:50:13] <A_High_Ordinator> School bullies have high power levels
[5:50:20] <Cyral_Drive> what
[5:50:21] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> https://clips.twitch.tv/TenderAmazingDonutBCouch
[5:50:31] <Virokwet> its kinda fun. in the other direction is a secret
[5:50:32] <hereticalzed2> There's a path back from that
[5:50:33] <rytisone> amaaazing
[5:50:40] <Lapinelis> You got halfway up.
[5:50:41] <jbees7> I think there is a force essence there
[5:50:45] <Cyral_Drive> what about the big dragon thing
[5:50:46] <hereticalzed2> You grab a rope hanging over the big room and run on a wall then get more force essence
[5:50:48] <MorWakaWaka> a true jedi would have simply flown back up.
[5:50:58] <hereticalzed2> I don't think you can ever actually get to the big dragon thing can you?
[5:51:16] <+Lifes_A_Lich> His big journey comes to an end by not making that one jump LUL
[5:51:19] <Lapinelis> Don't think so, no
[5:51:29] <Lapinelis> At least I didn't figure one out
[5:51:54] <%JJCheeker> I miss jolee bindo... such a great character
[5:52:01] <redrix_3> what in the fucks a consequence
[5:52:35] <MorWakaWaka> It's weird that droids are just treated like lifeforms in Star Wars. They get more respect than the clones.
[5:52:41] <kiwicoffin> I'm sure that will be useful in all coming combat
[5:52:50] <cap_bon> how do they plan to defend this thing from a star destroyer
[5:52:51] <+HorribleHog> Listen, star wars is hard franchise to write for because there's not a lot of reference material
[5:53:13] <kiwicoffin> This is definitely an impossible space
[5:53:13] <Lapinelis> Droids are weird, droids are between lifeforms and just tools
[5:53:14] <%JJCheeker> Mcmuffin
[5:53:14] <ChrisM341> No but Shut Up Though
[5:53:30] <Wynzler> But muh trials
[5:53:46] <ChoculaUltra> when awkward game design makes the Empire seem competent
[5:53:47] <%JJCheeker> He wanted them all to himself
[5:53:47] <redrix_3> he thought it be funny
[5:53:56] <hereticalzed2> So whoever came looking for it would have to research the Zeffo like he did I think
[5:54:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ver big
[5:54:12] <redrix_3> yoda apparently could make them by hand
[5:54:12] <jbees7> I think the zeffo build the temple and the list
[5:54:13] <hereticalzed2> He wanted people to recreate the path he took so they'd learn something
[5:54:15] <Lapinelis> You keep mentioning bane novels, what exactly are they?
[5:54:16] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> It's built like one? As in it's very mazelike?
[5:54:21] <hereticalzed2> in this case, that the Zeffo were cool then fucked up
[5:54:21] <canisdyluna> "why didn't you throw the key, asshole!"
[5:54:35] <jbees7> this vision gave me code vein ptsd
[5:54:38] <$doomp12> attack one
[5:54:39] <Wynzler> Hey like the jedi!
[5:54:41] <ckbooks> That's what I want my statue to look like when I die.
[5:54:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the MEMEs
[5:54:45] <ChrisM341> He's taking a selfie
[5:54:53] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Hubris probably.
[5:54:54] <hereticalzed2> Decadence
[5:54:56] <Big_Dream> it's almost like the foce is an asshole
[5:54:56] <+Lifes_A_Lich> What a...compromising position they died in starM
[5:54:57] <Wynzler> Because hubris or something
[5:54:57] <OminousBagel> Inbreeding
[5:55:00] <bear_breaker20> they keep expanding
[5:55:01] <MorWakaWaka> the xenomorph did it
[5:55:01] <+HorribleHog> Decadence
[5:55:01] <rytisone> Reapers
[5:55:04] <kiwicoffin> They just start jacking off all the time and never fucking
[5:55:13] <+eanscrale> Something Something allegory to rome
[5:55:13] <bear_breaker20> havent read asimov?
[5:55:15] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Maybe they forgot to have sex.
[5:55:15] <%Samex_Comex> What the fuck is that!?
[5:55:17] <grander76> hey its me zeffo
[5:55:21] <%JJCheeker> they look like salarians
[5:55:25] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Like the Chozo.
[5:55:29] <Big_Dream> they went to mass effect
[5:55:32] <Wynzler> They went to wherever the ancient mayans went
[5:55:43] <geekjacob> you should ask the uzan vong
[5:55:50] <PowerfulBlackGangs> *zip*
[5:55:56] <Big_Dream> he cant event ech the force his a padawan
[5:55:57] <kiwicoffin> I like that he still has the poncho
[5:55:59] <+eanscrale> Of course
[5:55:59] <Psyramics> more younglings for annie to kill
[5:56:01] <+HorribleHog> why are there only human children
[5:56:01] <+eanscrale> they always do
[5:56:02] <redrix_3> anakin walks in
[5:56:02] <Big_Dream> he can barely foce push
[5:56:08] <Habblewater> Gonna put all these kids in a cage like that mean old anakin
[5:56:09] <+eanscrale> They have all the infrastructure
[5:56:23] <+StreamStopA> stop using your brain
[5:56:23] <hereticalzed2> I guess they were still babies or something
[5:56:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> not that long ago
[5:56:26] <Lapinelis> 6 years later,
[5:56:27] <MorWakaWaka> This is dumb. Kill those younglings, they're unworthy.
[5:56:33] <cap_bon> ok so say they get the list and kill every force sensitive child right this second wont more just be born anyway?
[5:56:34] <kiwicoffin> Maclunky
[5:56:39] <ChoculaUltra> Jedi Master Maclunky.
[5:56:40] <+sordcooper> fuckin rhodians
[5:56:40] <+HorribleHog> oh thank goodness it wasnt just humans
[5:56:43] <Habblewater> "Get shot first idiot"
[5:56:44] <Wynzler> I think it's supposed to be part of that force procognitive thing
[5:56:46] <rytisone> LULU
[5:56:48] <rytisone> LUL
[5:56:50] <Virokwet> maybe it works like a dragon radar and less like a literal list.
[5:56:58] <i_am_therydon> i like that they added a rodian instead of default human.
[5:56:58] <hereticalzed2> Nah it's a list
[5:57:07] <Cyral_Drive> cooming
[5:57:11] <ckbooks> Watch out for Mads Mikkelsen.
[5:57:12] <Habblewater> Kinda cool
[5:57:17] <mortelkilll> its kind of a nice sequence
[5:57:18] <Wynzler> Right, but the list was made with force precognition
[5:57:19] <ChoculaUltra> oh man that Rodian kid is totally getting force choked by an Inquisitor
[5:57:19] <TardigradeRex> To not get shot?
[5:57:20] <+Shaggnar> Cover is still cover
[5:57:24] <Chatterbox1991> use the Hellriegal its OP
[5:57:25] <Habblewater> Did you forget about Hoth?
[5:57:27] <+Lifes_A_Lich> They used trenches on hoth
[5:57:27] <jbees7> are the zeffo in the old canan? and what are they
[5:57:29] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> But the high ground though.
[5:57:31] <Ynkubus18> premade grave
[5:57:32] <%JJCheeker> juuuta wonky solo
[5:57:33] <geekjacob> holy shit they are
[5:57:34] <TardigradeRex> There's is 100% trenches in part 5
[5:57:34] <MorWakaWaka> Hey that was pretty cool.
[5:57:36] <jbees7> *canon
[5:57:42] <$Punisher7771> yep
[5:57:47] <Chatterbox1991> We Have Taken Objective Apples
[5:57:50] <Wynzler> This sequence is pretty cool tho
[5:57:56] <+HorribleHog> stop saying younglings laeKipu
[5:58:00] <mortelkilll> i liek this sequence
[5:58:03] <kiwicoffin> Kill the gross rhodian
[5:58:04] <hereticalzed2> Killing yeunglings
[5:58:06] <mortelkilll> actual developpement fro mthe mc
[5:58:20] <mortelkilll> hes finally realising that this idea is stupid
[5:58:27] <hereticalzed2> The plot and character development is super on the nose because they couldn't work it fluidly into the gameplay
[5:58:28] <MorWakaWaka> is darth vader going to appear?
[5:58:28] <$Punisher7771> appernly plasma cant go through dirt?
[5:58:35] <Wynzler> This is like the equivalent of that One Good Scene in every David Cage game
[5:58:35] <Daxalog> Kid got Combod
[5:58:38] <+eanscrale> Did he jump to meet the laser's blast?
[5:58:38] <Lapinelis> See, guns are pretty effective
[5:58:50] <geekjacob> holy shit he dead
[5:59:08] <kiwicoffin> Just revealing this alters this future
[5:59:09] <rytisone> your quest is stupid, go home
[5:59:13] <redrix_3> proceeds to do stupid idea because funny
[5:59:17] <+OmegaWeltall> i know right Kappa
[5:59:22] <hereticalzed2> Sexy Vader
[5:59:27] <+Lifes_A_Lich> This weird force spook house
[5:59:30] <T_Sasquatch> Aren't guns one shot kills in star wars if blaster proof armor isn't worn
[5:59:38] <Wynzler> So wait
[5:59:45] <+eanscrale> Inqusitin time lads!
[5:59:49] <Lapinelis> It's kinda teenage movie horror plot. If people were smart, there wouldn't be a movie.
[5:59:50] <Habblewater> oh it's those doors from the end of the first prequel movie
[5:59:53] <Wynzler> They had to capture the younglings just so they could be murdered properly later?
[5:59:55] <kiwicoffin> Jedi don't cry STOP CRYING
[6:00:04] <redrix_3> hot?
[6:00:05] <hereticalzed2> Remember that Cal's only concept of family/stability/love is the Jedi Order
[6:00:05] <mortelkilll> stop crying, its dark side!
[6:00:06] <geekjacob> you were weak
[6:00:07] <Dumple_Roe> or to serve evil?....I guess
[6:00:10] <hereticalzed2> so this is actually super revelation for him
[6:00:11] <+HorribleHog> this is good story elements in a poor package though
[6:00:17] <Chatterbox1991> Plague do you like this game?
[6:00:21] <StealthlessFox> You are.....SIX years OOOOLD
[6:00:22] <mortelkilll> by this game standart this is kidna good
[6:00:24] <+OmegaWeltall> Schism ?
[6:00:31] <grander76> lol that ep was cool
[6:00:34] <canisdyluna> there are 4 lights
[6:00:34] <kiwicoffin> Hell yeah join the dark side
[6:00:36] <TardigradeRex> Griping leads to the Dunk Side.
[6:00:37] <mortelkilll> finally a red lightsaber
[6:00:39] <MorWakaWaka> woah your evil now
[6:00:41] <T_Sasquatch> Finally
[6:00:45] <Daxalog> I like the suit
[6:00:48] <grander76> rip odo
[6:00:48] <aeravon> Inquisitor armor
[6:00:49] <Psyramics> join the Dark Side our aesthetics are so much cooler
[6:00:50] <LordSDB> new look
[6:00:52] <i_am_therydon> i wish we got that outfit.
[6:00:55] <MorWakaWaka> you were the sexy darth vader all along
[6:00:56] <+Lifes_A_Lich> They took your pink poncho D:
[6:00:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool outfit
[6:00:59] <Wynzler> His palms are evil now
[6:01:03] <+eanscrale> Yeah cause he doesn't have the dumb poncho
[6:01:03] <ChoculaUltra> he looks like a Moff
[6:01:05] <hereticalzed2> Redheads are evil
[6:01:06] <jbees7> thats one sexy boy
[6:01:06] <+corrosivePaladin> He still looks like a huge nerd tho
[6:01:07] <Chatterbox1991> Everyone looks better in their evil form
[6:01:08] <T_Sasquatch> Fuck canon and make it a useable costume
[6:01:11] <hereticalzed2> The Force knows this
[6:01:12] <+Punishedkaiger> @PlagueOfGripes At least the force is telling him that his plan was fucking stupid
[6:01:13] <MorWakaWaka> Yiou dont like his white poncho?
[6:01:14] <+eanscrale> Just give him the weaboo robes
[6:01:15] <ChrisM341> Darth Joker
[6:01:15] <Twad_Feu> well, its decent armor
[6:01:15] <Wynzler> His palms have sinned more than any other part of his body
[6:01:18] <%JJCheeker> LMG has to fight his evil self
[6:01:23] <+StreamStopA> sad>crying>being a bitch>dark side
[6:01:34] <hereticalzed2> I guess they just forgot the program in your outfit options for these cutscenes
[6:01:37] <%JJCheeker> Omg
[6:01:37] <+eanscrale> He'd be like an accountant
[6:01:41] <kiwicoffin> Trilla would twist his head into his own ass
[6:01:46] <OminousBagel> He showed anger. That's a Jedi no no
[6:02:00] <mortelkilll> lets destroy that list
[6:02:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> break it
[6:02:10] <+TQuick101> nani?!
[6:02:14] <%JJCheeker> Don't open it otherwise cenobite will come after you
[6:02:23] <Wynzler> All evil people dont shower
[6:02:25] <+eanscrale> Too much eyeshadow for sure
[6:02:27] <Lapinelis> Looks stupid, yes. But has great hips
[6:02:27] <kiwicoffin> She always says a mouthful
[6:02:27] <Chatterbox1991> All sith look dumb without their helmet
[6:02:27] <SuperVaderMan> she wears a lot of eye makeup
[6:02:27] <Murphio_GS> She looks like Kylo Ren
[6:02:30] <Murphio_GS> honestly
[6:02:30] <Wynzler> So they're pretty greasy by default
[6:02:30] <hereticalzed2> Dark Side hair grease
[6:02:30] <OminousBagel> She looks like a crazy stalker ex
[6:02:35] <mortelkilll> just break it right here right now
[6:02:44] <MorWakaWaka> Did they just rule 63 Adam Driver?
[6:02:47] <Savior127> Trilla is a poor mans Mercedes from Dragons Dogma
[6:02:49] <%JJCheeker> She needs to brush her teeth
[6:03:05] <mortelkilll> mercedes already wasnt doing well
[6:03:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i hope she fly's away
[6:03:11] <+OmegaWeltall> yea taht Malicos fight was annoying
[6:03:12] <hereticalzed2> This fight is super short IIRC
[6:03:24] <StealthlessFox> She's right, Plague is fearful of the BLOCK
[6:03:31] <%JJCheeker> How convenient she showed up right when you pick up the mcmuffin
[6:03:39] <Lapinelis> @Savior127 And mercedes is a poor man's Casca from Berserk
[6:03:45] <chronoxgp> use your ninjutsu
[6:03:50] <MorWakaWaka> Why isn't she fat? What? Fat women can't be Sith Lords? How offensive
[6:03:52] <redrix_3> why does she just kinda stand there
[6:03:55] <+corrosivePaladin> Im gonna go with she broke
[6:04:03] <OlmStranger> feels like the ai is busted
[6:04:07] <Wynzler> She was actually in line first but you cut in front of her for the mcmuffin
[6:04:12] <+showmeyourmango> yeah this is bugged lol
[6:04:12] <mortelkilll> shes weirdly passive
[6:04:14] <geekjacob> is she busted?
[6:04:15] <Wynzler> You happened to get the last one and now she's pissed
[6:04:18] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Man this is disappointing, I thought she'd be a cool fight
[6:04:18] <Twad_Feu> and yup, another damage sponge. At that point one wonder if a lightsaber is a high-tech pool noodle that deals embarassment damage.
[6:04:19] <Lapinelis> Did she bug out?
[6:04:24] <+corrosivePaladin> I think you totally broke her AI
[6:04:26] <Big_Dream> its bugged my dude
[6:04:28] <geekjacob> i think she bugged out
[6:04:30] <kiwicoffin> She's only using her unblockable
[6:04:32] <hereticalzed2> lol yeah I think she's bugged
[6:04:34] <rytisone> she seems bugged
[6:04:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> just hang back and watch how long she'll stand there
[6:04:37] <redrix_3> she seems fucking catatonic
[6:04:40] <hereticalzed2> there it goes
[6:04:42] <canisdyluna> i love that star wars writers know fuck all about swordsmanship..
[6:04:43] <Cyral_Drive> She just stood there the whole time
[6:04:48] <cap_bon> Shes just standing there menacingly
[6:04:50] <+HorribleHog> no water splashes
[6:04:50] <Savior127> It seems like they also tried to copy DMC3's Vergil boss formula. Facing her three times
[6:04:51] <Wynzler> Oh no, he douched the no no saber
[6:04:56] <chronoxgp> that looks like a childs play thing
[6:05:06] <+StreamStopA> I find your lack of chin disturbing.
[6:05:13] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> im going to be stupid
[6:05:14] <kiwicoffin> All the Jedi have a shitty plan
[6:05:16] <+OmegaWeltall> i donno i think she's kinda cute
[6:05:21] <+eanscrale> Yeah no, the force don't do jack
[6:05:23] <ChoculaUltra> did Trilla abandon the younglings?!
[6:05:23] <Big_Dream> that was bad plan
[6:05:25] <Daxalog> Thats not how they sound!
[6:05:26] <sleepyleo15> shoot fire
[6:05:26] <+bitstorm_> poke it's massive eyes
[6:05:33] <sleepyleo15> Shoot first
[6:05:33] <MorWakaWaka> aren't fat people the majority? And yet there never represented in media.
[6:05:34] <hereticalzed2> Here we go kiddos
[6:05:35] <rytisone> Trilla is scared by hanging out with the monsters all the time
[6:05:44] <Sapphire_Breeze> maybe the crystal is in there or some parts
[6:05:46] <Big_Dream> the force
[6:05:49] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> force magic
[6:05:51] <Dumple_Roe> force crystal memory or idk
[6:05:52] <hereticalzed2> It's her lightsaber
[6:05:52] <+HorribleHog> it's forced
[6:05:53] <Big_Dream> it is now
[6:05:58] <hereticalzed2> I guess it is now
[6:06:02] <SuperVaderMan> The writers doesn't know how this stuff works LUL
[6:06:04] <+bitstorm_> is this how she got her big eyes?
[6:06:04] <Savior127> And why does Trilla know Cal has this ability?
[6:06:08] <ckbooks> magic
[6:06:10] <kiwicoffin> Maybe he's more powerful now
[6:06:19] <eccentricprinceofroses> she had the lightsaber crystal up her ass this entire time
[6:06:22] <jbees7> its a force object you dont know
[6:06:22] <Wynzler> Her eyes broke her out
[6:06:27] <eccentricprinceofroses> so it was technically here for all these moments
[6:06:29] <redrix_3> angry emoji?
[6:06:30] <Big_Dream> damn if only she would use her powers more often
[6:06:32] <+StreamStopA> the dark side power of NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[6:06:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> how shocking
[6:06:36] <Lapinelis> And that was when her eyes popped out
[6:06:42] <cap_bon> did they not polish the visor first
[6:06:43] <+Shaggnar> That's not very evil, that's actually rather useful
[6:06:43] <+TheShisno> Yeah but it's a path to the Dark Side thooooo... wehh
[6:06:46] <Savior127> And dont forget to ask yourself, why does Trilla hate her master again?
[6:06:50] <Rodzzila> It does NOW, god damit!
[6:06:54] <$doomp12> that helmet looks DUMB ON YOU
[6:06:58] <Lapinelis> 4?
[6:06:58] <TardigradeRex> How many? Yes!
[6:07:01] <Wynzler> Grievous 2.0
[6:07:05] <SuperVaderMan> This will make a fine addition to my collection!
[6:07:06] <geekjacob> 3
[6:07:11] <kiwicoffin> You now have like 5 different blades
[6:07:13] <+bitstorm_> put them on ebay
[6:07:15] <Dumple_Roe> enough to beat grevious
[6:07:23] <+TheShisno> Her helicopter saber
[6:07:31] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Just like Gilgamesh, or Grevious I get.
[6:07:32] <MorWakaWaka> Is it normal for a noble jedi to greedily collect lightsabers as trophies?
[6:07:35] <+HorribleHog> I hope the ending is you spinning them all around like Grievous
[6:07:36] <LordSDB> Maybe this dude becomes griveous
[6:07:37] <%JJCheeker> Hurray mcmuffin
[6:07:38] <Lapinelis> Why doesn't anyone just bomb those small tunnels
[6:07:38] <+Lifes_A_Lich> Cal becomes Grievous
[6:07:41] <Savior127> Now combine all those sabers to form the legendary Star Saber.
[6:07:44] <hereticalzed2> Data never gets copied what are you talking about
[6:07:46] <$Punisher7771> all the sabers
[6:07:53] <Psyramics> I mean, reworking a Jedi's lightsaber into a Sith lightsibar as an act of corruption is the kind of dramatics the Sith live for
[6:08:03] <rosemon5001> you can now be one of those rare more than 2 blades at a time jedis
[6:08:06] <Daxalog> Remamber your big dumb twirl move when you press those 2 buttons together
[6:08:10] <mortelkilll> should ve just stabbed the cube
[6:08:19] <cap_bon> Imagine if you had some kind of flying device and could just enter all these places through the sky light
[6:08:19] <Wynzler> The empire doesnt even have password encryption on any of their shit
[6:09:18] <Lapinelis> One saber does more damage. Dual saber does less but more aoe
[6:09:19] <MorWakaWaka> Turn the map off Plague, use the force to find your way
[6:09:23] <rytisone> one saber - more damage, two - for groups of enemies
[6:09:28] <rosemon5001> @Wynzler if one plan to make your army ultimately loose works why change it for the second go around
[6:09:30] <Daxalog> 2FA or putting it in a holocron like building?
[6:09:45] <cap_bon> in the EU stuff have any storm troopers just thrown away there weapons when a jedi starts charging them because fck those blasters are useless
[6:09:55] <kiwicoffin> I would let everyone of these guys live if they put their weapons down
[6:09:58] <ChoculaUltra> many, many times.
[6:10:03] <MorWakaWaka> These ledges are giving me Shadow of the Empire flashbacks
[6:10:03] <PowerfulBlackGangs> "I'm now a pacifist!"
[6:10:04] <Savior127> too bad they didnt ham up the grunt's dialogue.
[6:10:32] <Savior127> "She gave me her light saber and I sniffed it"
[6:10:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> "it's not the past that matters Cal, but what we do with the future"
[6:10:40] <+eanscrale> Did she do anything though???
[6:10:45] <+eanscrale> Where was the lightning
[6:10:47] <kiwicoffin> It's an arcade game
[6:10:48] <Virokwet> its a ball puzzle!
[6:10:53] <hereticalzed2> It's just another poncho
[6:10:59] <MorWakaWaka> this doesn't look very fun
[6:11:02] <Wynzler> The hole is your home
[6:11:03] <jbees7> the worst puzzle in the game !
[6:11:04] <rytisone> gotta go around
[6:11:21] <MorWakaWaka> does this even count as a puzzle?
[6:11:31] <Daxalog> PAR: 4
[6:11:46] <kiwicoffin> I want to hear what BD thinks you aren't doing
[6:11:50] <Virokwet> yup
[6:11:55] <$Punisher7771> why cant the force lift the ball?
[6:11:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> 10/10 hint
[6:11:57] <hereticalzed2> This took me a few times to line up just right
[6:11:58] <jbees7> it wants you to suffer
[6:11:59] <Virokwet> LUL
[6:12:02] <TheoTTree> Look at this game going YOU WANT A HINT BUD? Constantly
[6:12:05] <Savior127> Wait a minute, that card!"
[6:12:05] <MorWakaWaka> hint: put ball in hole
[6:12:05] <kiwicoffin> What a fucking hint
[6:12:09] <geekjacob> force push and freeze?
[6:12:09] <+Lifes_A_Lich> You gotta do it right!
[6:12:09] <rytisone> tip: git gud
[6:12:11] <ChoculaUltra> brilliant observation, BD
[6:12:11] <weissguard> LUL
[6:12:17] <Lapinelis> just do it
[6:12:20] <%Samex_Comex> Mini golf
[6:12:22] <+HorribleHog> match the round object with the round hole
[6:12:36] <+Demonstrandum> You know, I never really appreciated that Dark Souls doesn't have dumbass puzzles
[6:12:38] <+Lifes_A_Lich> BD: Just do it right stupid 4Head
[6:12:46] <rosemon5001> hmm does time stop work on it?
[6:12:49] <cap_bon> just dig up
[6:12:50] <Big_Dream> force pull the push
[6:13:01] <kiwicoffin> Sometimes you have to mix in the force slow
[6:13:02] <rytisone> trial and error
[6:13:07] <Savior127> man if only you can just lift it
[6:13:16] <SuperVaderMan> Just keep pushing it and hope the physics work eventually
[6:13:20] <Big_Dream> almost
[6:13:22] <SuperVaderMan> cool puzzle
[6:13:22] <%JJCheeker> Close
[6:13:23] <+Punishedkaiger> That was close
[6:13:23] <Virokwet> huh
[6:13:29] <+Punishedkaiger> Looked like the right idea
[6:13:31] <kiwicoffin> This just demonstrates how lame the powers are
[6:13:34] <MorWakaWaka> It's actually a good hint because you think "is this stupid crap really what I'm suppose to do" but then Bd confirms.
[6:13:42] <%JJCheeker> BS that was in
[6:13:46] <+bitstorm_> try lining it up just right
[6:13:55] <aeravon> Why couldnt you just cut through the gate with a lightsaber. Because gameplay.
[6:14:01] <+sordcooper> force powered physic puzzles wasnt what i would have expected from this game
[6:14:02] <+HorribleHog> I hate that you have to look through a fence
[6:14:22] <+Punishedkaiger> Do it less strong
[6:14:28] <$Punisher7771> this is a badly desined puzzle when you have the fuckin force
[6:14:29] <geekjacob> that would bee too easy
[6:14:34] <MorWakaWaka> @HorribleHog yeah thats bugging me too
[6:14:56] <eccentricprinceofroses> is a second time stop while its on the curve too ambitious?
[6:14:57] <Wynzler> could you imagine how horrid this would be if your force powers were limited even outside of combat
[6:15:00] <+xeromage> mini golf
[6:15:03] <+bitstorm_> have you tried lining it up just right tho
[6:15:06] <Savior127> Too bad you can just go through that obvious GAP
[6:15:09] <kiwicoffin> It's also not fun
[6:15:09] <+HorribleHog> especially when cal has slipped through holes the size that exist in this fence
[6:15:10] <redrix_3> this is the second most mentally taxing puzzle in the game
[6:15:21] <+HorribleHog> MorWakaWaka laeKipu
[6:15:22] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Can you pull it towards you when it's near the whole?
[6:15:24] <%Violated_Muffins> C'mon Boomer its just like golf
[6:15:24] <cap_bon> if only the charatcer had some kind of device that could cut through metal
[6:15:43] <geekjacob> push and frezze alot i guess
[6:15:51] <eccentricprinceofroses> stares in limbo
[6:15:59] <kiwicoffin> I wouldn't call ball-in-cup a puzzle
[6:16:01] <ChoculaUltra> so does the force not work on fences, is that the implication
[6:16:04] <MorWakaWaka> yeah I dont think this is technically a puzzle.
[6:16:11] <mortelkilll> well there also problem solving where you just find a way over an obstacle instead of looking for a specific solution
[6:16:22] <jbees7> i think i did it with alot of little pushes but I don't really remember anymore
[6:16:35] <TheLoneUnicorn> The obvious solution is to spam
[6:16:37] <eccentricprinceofroses> alternate pushes and stop
[6:16:39] <Virokwet> daaaam
[6:16:43] <+bitstorm_> @PlagueOfGripes instead of freezing on its way up how about pause it when it's rolling back?
[6:16:45] <%JJCheeker> Damn it that was so close
[6:16:45] <redrix_3> that looked perfect
[6:17:02] <Earlymanchan> atpGasm
[6:17:02] <MorWakaWaka> Now do it two more times
[6:17:03] <rytisone> what a puzzle
[6:17:08] <redrix_3> worth?
[6:17:12] <Virokwet> i wish i had thought to use slow
[6:17:12] <PowerfulBlackGangs> Do it for the drugs
[6:17:15] <%JJCheeker> Stupid ball

[6:22:25] <kiwicoffin> I get the feeling they set this up like they're the Guardians of the Galaxy
[6:22:29] <Noktifer> She's a nothing character, but she is the most realistic due to feeling sane.
[6:22:36] <+eanscrale> yeah it's star wars
[6:22:41] <Noktifer> She's just, normal, in a world of FANTASTICAL when it comes to her view.

[6:27:04] <SuperVaderMan> It's cool that her Force cloaking device hides all the ship emissions and stuff too

[6:33:13] <Tubit> pink ligthsaber PogChamp
[6:33:22] <hereticalzed2> That's not Disney friendly Hog
[6:33:23] <dukenux> Opening doors with a lightsaber was a secret grey jedi technique that died with Qui Gon
[6:33:27] <hereticalzed2> They're just sleeping
[6:33:55] <sonofthedeepsouth> hard locks
[6:34:01] <+HorribleHog> That's right if you put a saber through a guys belly it just puts them to sleep
[6:34:02] <dukenux> they AI has problems with going through doors anyway
[6:34:19] <Habblewater> my PENIS is STRONG and PURPLE

[6:36:03] <Habblewater> Purge Trooper got the hardest dick for this
[6:36:06] <Psyramics> you think about it, this is a terrible place for a lightsaber. One errant cut and the whole section starts flooding

[6:38:30] <SuperVaderMan> why did a button press cause the thing to explode
[6:38:31] <%Samex_Comex> Oh shit it is sealab!
[6:38:33] <hereticalzed2> Just start pressing buttons and maybe it'll work out
[6:38:35] <kiwicoffin> How about holding it with force instead of shoving it around like dumb cat
[6:38:40] <OlmStranger> Detonating the underwater building you're in seems smart.
[6:38:48] <hereticalzed2> Force push on the right
[6:38:57] <hereticalzed2> Hard to see in the lighting
[6:38:58] <Triblade1992> I think you need to force push the water on the right
[6:38:59] <Savior127> im surprised he aint one bit worried that he's exploding shit UNDERWATER
[6:39:29] <eccentricprinceofroses> just sit here and wait for the water level to rise, this is a physics game right
[6:39:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thing 2 the right?
[6:39:31] <hereticalzed2> on the right

[6:41:57] <kiwicoffin> They flooded those guys out last year. Because they're evil
[6:41:58] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> protonLOL They left the troopers there fora while it seems.
[6:41:59] <LordSDB> this area has no moss in it
[6:42:06] <dukenux> Those stormtroopers were for decades here
[6:42:13] <dukenux> they just didnt bother pulling them out
[6:42:14] <Virokwet> probably

[6:59:34] <Twad_Feu> she try to be an attack helicpter?
[6:59:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> PLEASE TELL ME THIS GAME HAS THE HELICOPTER
[6:59:37] <+Punishedkaiger> It worked last time
[6:59:44] <sonofthedeepsouth> Helicopter Lightsaber move
[6:59:48] <+Shoosler> try doing a somersault !
[6:59:51] <dukenux> she's already doing it, Cal
[6:59:52] <LordSDB> For a fight that shows no health bar, this is taking way to long
[6:59:58] <canisdyluna> oh i hope she's gonna fly..
[7:00:02] <+heartbbyy> malding LULW
[7:00:08] <Kristoffers> health bar is up top buddy
[7:00:19] <+chiluzza> cant push her in the lava cause she has the mcguffin
[7:00:21] <LordSDB> Thats her block meter
[7:00:23] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> so is this the bad sekiro?
[7:00:35] <cap_bon> shes got that DS hyper armour LUL
[7:00:36] <mortelkilll> dont we want to destroy the macguffin aniway?
[7:00:36] <dukenux> her block meter is above her head, no?
[7:00:42] <LordSDB> yeah
[7:00:45] <+BuriasDempsey> no the red bar is her health my dude
[7:00:50] <hereticalzed2> and his is above his force bar
[7:00:52] <Triblade1992> Remember when Darth Vader threw his lightsaber and it was cool? Why don't we have the Inquistor Lightsaber fly around like crazy!
[7:00:55] <+k95zero> You have a stam meter
[7:00:59] <+Jaysky> I can already tell this is a contender for Plagues game if the year. Decade even.
[7:01:04] <eccentricprinceofroses> wow this fight looks just like the movies Kappa
[7:01:08] <KellBeII> i was gonna say bloodborne bosses
[7:01:13] <dukenux> yeah the one with her name underneat is life
[7:01:15] <sonofthedeepsouth> CINEMATIC
[7:01:16] <KellBeII> with their massive hp pool
[7:01:21] <MorWakaWaka> Is she voiced by Garnet from Steven Universe? When she say You cannot escape she sounds like her
[7:01:24] <hereticalzed2> I dodged this attack somehow
[7:01:24] <SuperVaderMan> Very cool
[7:01:24] <dukenux> *underneath
[7:01:26] <hereticalzed2> I forget though
[7:01:27] <+chiluzza> he fell through the world
[7:01:28] <Triblade1992> sad thing is that Gundir actually had a good boss fight in the beginning of Dark SOuls 3.
[7:01:28] <+k95zero> Use ANY force power when she is red
[7:01:29] <redrix_3> wtf was that
[7:01:29] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> very cool
[7:01:30] <+bitstorm_> what's the blue bar mean?
[7:01:44] <LordSDB> stamina
[7:01:46] <+Zerodyne90> hated that attack too
[7:01:48] <+HorribleHog> Are you saying there is something amiss with these bossfights? laeSusp
[7:01:49] <+k95zero> PUSH OR PULL
[7:01:50] <Virokwet> you can do it mr gripes
[7:01:54] <LordSDB> oh no force meter is blue
[7:01:54] <How2beDoge> this game have a multiplayer?
[7:01:58] <jbees7> blue bar is force bar
[7:02:00] <kiwicoffin> Playing with skill is for bitches. Abuse force powers
[7:02:13] <Triblade1992> yep
[7:02:15] <+bitstorm_> ah blue is force, cos she seemed to drain that?
[7:02:21] <+polypolipauli> This is one of those games that really ought to be played on easy difficulty, because there's nothing rewarding about the TYPE of challenge 'hard' offers
[7:02:22] <SayuKaiX> incoming ragequit..I can feel it
[7:02:27] <juxtest> She has cortosis underwear
[7:02:36] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> surely this game has consistent rules for its combat which make enemy and boss encounters fair and fun right?
[7:02:38] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> right?
[7:02:44] <+heartbbyy> just like the duel at the end of Revenge Of The Sith, drawn out and unengaging
[7:02:53] <dukenux> GET OVAH HERE
[7:02:56] <+chiluzza> wait whyh the fuck doesnt cal use two sabers all the time
[7:03:01] <Storm_Samurai> She’s easier than that Dathomir guy at least
[7:03:04] <+DeezyVonDoom> Patients young padawan
[7:03:07] <+k95zero> @Mc_weak_to_arrow there is. Plague just isn't using them
[7:03:10] <valhallandoates> i wonder how damaged jedi's retina's are from staring at those fucking lightsabers all day
[7:03:13] <kiwicoffin> I'd prefer is she built up to all these abilities in previous fights
[7:03:16] <valhallandoates> like staring into a lightbulb
[7:03:30] <+HawkGoggles2> I'm a boss, I get amour frames by default. What do you have, Nothing?
[7:03:31] <+Punishedkaiger> Force push her
[7:03:34] <jbees7> all boss fights are dodge fights
[7:03:38] <+bitstorm_> ask bd-1 for a tip
[7:03:42] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @k95zero fair enough, that makes sense. it's just that the game seems kinda floaty which doesn't help
[7:04:13] <Wynzler> I bet if you lined it up just right you could beat her
[7:04:15] <Storm_Samurai> Use force lightning
[7:04:16] <Triblade1992> and sadly it ooks like the parry just keeps building back up
[7:04:17] <Habblewater> SHPEEEN
[7:04:21] <juxtest> Maybe shes right, maybe you cant win
[7:04:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> force push da bitch
[7:04:24] <redrix_3> you could try praying. my boy budha could hook you up with infinite health or something since i think hes cool with "questionable" art
[7:04:25] <LordSDB> I enjoy playing on harder difficulty, but when it's just damage sponge's, forced one way solutions, and nothing to learn it really sucks
[7:04:28] <+k95zero> @Mc_weak_to_arrow his main problem is when flashes red, you can force pull or push her. and he isn't watching his stam
[7:04:31] <+bitstorm_> the loser goes in the torture chair?
[7:05:03] <T_Sasquatch> Just force push of the edge LUL
[7:05:06] <+Shoosler> flicc her bean
[7:05:10] <+TheSaintJohn> Dark Souls 4, feat. 14 new boss demos
[7:05:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> dark eater midir
[7:05:38] <Storm_Samurai> Duel saber is for groups single does more damage
[7:05:42] <redrix_3> how do you avoid that slam attack?
[7:05:44] <Triblade1992> what?
[7:06:01] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> command grabs are the power of the dark side
[7:06:03] <geekjacob> nothing personal kid
[7:06:04] <Triblade1992> all the wrong lessons from Dark Souls
[7:06:13] <+chiluzza> the lightsaber fucking warped back to her from its animation
[7:06:14] <+k95zero> @redrix_3 jump or force push/pull her as she does it
[7:06:16] <LordSDB> you have to guess if she's going to stab the ground or do a force psuh, so thats 50/50
[7:06:24] <redrix_3> aj
[7:06:28] <redrix_3> ah*
[7:06:36] <+wcnighthawk125> you'll get the hang of it after a few fights
[7:06:59] <+k95zero> PULL WHEN SHE IS RED
[7:07:10] <jbees7> it is not as bad as plague makes it out to be but it is not fun
[7:07:13] <Savior127> You can only Pull her when she's using an Unblockable
[7:07:13] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> ^
[7:07:14] <Virokwet> gdang it
[7:07:15] <redrix_3> almost 50%
[7:07:16] <Habblewater> I bet she doesn't even need transport, she just helicopters whereever she needs to be
[7:07:16] <Snirtax> She sure did tank those two lightsaber swings to the torso
[7:07:18] <Triblade1992> geez
[7:07:22] <%JJCheeker> I like how you just clip through the floor
[7:07:26] <+TQuick101> big yikes
[7:07:30] <+k95zero> PULL WHEN RED PLAGUE
[7:07:33] <hereticalzed2> This is the final boss incidentally
[7:07:34] <+DeezyVonDoom> Lmfaoooooooooooooo
[7:07:34] <+Zerodyne90> HahaNutcracker
[7:07:37] <Triblade1992> All the wrong lessons brought to you by DARK SOULS 3
[7:07:38] <Twad_Feu> if you replaced the lightsabers with sticks, the fight woudnt change at all
[7:07:46] <Storm_Samurai> Vwooom
[7:07:48] <+Zerodyne90> what difficulty is this btw?
[7:07:55] <kiwicoffin> Landing hits is more rewarding for the boss than Cal
[7:08:01] <Storm_Samurai> Midichlorians
[7:08:02] <+averagelyre> so that's how they fly
[7:08:05] <+k95zero> Not as difficult as he is making it
[7:08:12] <+HorribleHog> poise is working as intended
[7:08:12] <+bitstorm_> maybe the double ender may be more effective?
[7:08:32] <Storm_Samurai> Pink poncho is too low defense
[7:08:39] <+DeezyVonDoom> He needs to parry more
[7:08:57] <juxtest> This is when Kyle Katarn would shoot her with a rocket launcher
[7:09:01] <Habblewater> SUFFER LIKE GEE DID
[7:09:04] <T_Sasquatch> Looool
[7:09:05] <Storm_Samurai> Might wanna heal
[7:09:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lel
[7:09:16] <hereticalzed2> I don't think he watches his health bar
[7:09:21] <+polypolipauli> Give in to your anger
[7:09:28] <+Zerodyne90> HahaShrugMiddle
[7:09:31] <+k95zero> The pull stops the attack and drains her stam
[7:09:32] <chronoxgp> use the dark side
[7:09:33] <+bitstorm_> @Habblewater im probably the only person that knows that reference
[7:09:50] <+heartbbyy> i remember streamers dying over 50 times to genichiro when sekiro came out lmao
[7:09:51] <Habblewater> wouldn't be so sure of that
[7:09:52] <Savior127> Two hits - Pull/Push - Repeat
[7:09:55] <+DeezyVonDoom> he should take the advise lol
[7:10:04] <%JJCheeker> This is a pretty elaborate interrogation room
[7:10:25] <hereticalzed2> I did the hold attack where it switches between single and double lightsaber to wear down her parry
[7:10:26] <+wcnighthawk125> use the dual saber strike
[7:10:39] <redrix_3> why does everything in starwars end in a fiery lava filled enviroment
[7:10:52] <Triblade1992> I hate how she also just immediately flash steps towards you. Damn it PRequels, you had to give us this
[7:10:56] <+DeezyVonDoom> lmfao
[7:11:04] <+Shoosler> Venom "Punished" Plague
[7:11:21] <eccentricprinceofroses> if you just alternate between like two hits and then backroll back to safe distance
[7:11:31] <eccentricprinceofroses> can that grind her down
[7:11:32] <Daxalog> Its doing damage
[7:11:32] <cap_bon> can you even break her guard
[7:11:37] <jbees7> i played this on hard and dodge and do 2 hits became every bossfight
[7:11:43] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> wait this is the final boss?
[7:11:46] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> she has no cool helmet?
[7:11:47] <hereticalzed2> yes
[7:11:53] <Triblade1992> Could you imagine this stupid fight in Grandmaster status?
[7:11:57] <hereticalzed2> she loses her helmet early on in the world's least surprising plot twist
[7:11:58] <+DeezyVonDoom> yes you can break her guard lol
[7:12:18] <chronoxgp> shes good with the mundane avlyne build
[7:12:22] <Savior127> Parrying her Throw also did damage
[7:12:27] <hereticalzed2> heal you fool
[7:12:32] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @hereticalzed2 what a waste
[7:12:38] <+bitstorm_> toss me off bd
[7:12:40] <redrix_3> that lightsaber reflect thing takes like 5% of her health aswell i think
[7:12:43] <Habblewater> oh wow i looked up a guide and it actually gets more bullshit
[7:12:51] <juxtest> Shes cheating!
[7:13:01] <chronoxgp> take the high ground
[7:13:04] <Triblade1992> Guns are uncivilized. Grenades though? Nah brah that's cool
[7:13:16] <SuperVaderMan> grenades just flying out of her ass LUL
[7:13:20] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> wow a qte
[7:13:25] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> epic
[7:13:26] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> gameplay
[7:13:28] <mortelkilll> ive seen worse faces
[7:13:29] <Virokwet> i disagree
[7:13:32] <Lapinelis> To be fair, all sith have ugly faces
[7:13:34] <jiin6> they all have ugly faces
[7:13:35] <+Jaysky> WOW rude
[7:13:36] <T_Sasquatch> Its kinda hot tho
[7:13:40] <DragonBornKing> the lightsaber duels in jedi outcast were way cooler
[7:13:44] <+Shoosler> i'd blow a load on that face
[7:13:49] <dukenux> i dont necessiraly agree
[7:13:52] <Snirtax> Time to mash. Mashing is fun and really makes you feel like you're clashing lightsabers with giant nose over there
[7:13:57] <jiin6> i mean look at that ginger, sooo ugly Kappa
[7:13:57] <AJusticeLemon> even the qte only gives you one hit
[7:13:58] <+TQuick101> giddy's pretty good looking
[7:14:00] <+DeezyVonDoom> samsies
[7:14:01] <$doomp12> it gets worse
[7:14:03] <dukenux> but i still like her with helmet on more Kappa
[7:14:06] <eccentricprinceofroses> plague dont go for anything interesting
[7:14:09] <mortelkilll> people are bizzarely demanding about videogame characters pretyness
[7:14:14] <eccentricprinceofroses> you almost have this just lame her out
[7:14:18] <eccentricprinceofroses> 2 hits roll back
[7:14:30] <redrix_3> i mean you're doing great rn
[7:14:36] <Snirtax> I love how you need to be eighty kilometers away from that grenade but she deadass doesn't care
[7:14:41] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @mortelkilll agreed
[7:14:45] <+bitstorm_> shouldnt that beady eyed lass be doing this fight?
[7:14:50] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> it's years of conditioning
[7:14:51] <Virokwet> fuck that move
[7:14:56] <rytisone> no flying droids?
[7:15:02] <Fironial> the grab has amazing tracking except when it doesn't.
[7:15:08] <antaresprt> Almost thought that nade is something your meant to pick up to like break her block or something
[7:15:19] <eccentricprinceofroses> Plague no stop trying mechanics they're a bait
[7:15:20] <geekjacob> cant you force push those grenades?
[7:15:23] <eccentricprinceofroses> this game has two buttons hit and roll
[7:15:24] <Virokwet> yeeeesss
[7:15:24] <+DeezyVonDoom> right? wheres the flying droid?

[7:15:59] <+Jaysky> Tell her she's a bad girl

[7:16:51] <dukenux> oh she looks okay here
[7:16:53] <Triblade1992> The thing is that Luke at least sensed the conflict inside Vader. Vader didm't want to be good. He wanted to be with his son
[7:16:53] <DragonBornKing> o

[7:19:10] <kiwicoffin> I'd rather Cal just jump into lava and end it all
[7:19:11] <eccentricprinceofroses> GET OFF THE HALO wait wrong game
[7:19:20] <mortelkilll> vader pretty much has huge plot armor so fighting hi mis pointless
[7:19:27] <%JJCheeker> So sick of the whole exploding platform s***
[7:19:33] <isidore_1869> get back and fight Vader ! Cal the Coward !
[7:19:33] <valhallandoates> can only end the game in a sonic run sequence
[7:19:39] <jiin6> hello there
[7:19:42] <aeravon> howwwww
[7:19:43] <Habblewater> "Hey"
[7:19:45] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Hello
[7:19:50] <hereticalzed2> He's gotta catch his breath
[7:19:52] <+Jaysky> He's sort of like a horror movie villain
[7:19:53] <Triblade1992> Darth Vader giving no fucks
[7:19:53] <dukenux> what
[7:19:54] <kiwicoffin> He's very lazy for a walking death machine
[7:19:55] <mortelkilll> i like that yo uhave to run away from vader
[7:20:00] <LordSDB> He's like jason
[7:20:01] <jiin6> he just stares there and breathes at us
[7:20:04] <eccentricprinceofroses> wait HE can cut through doors?!?
[7:20:08] <Sapphire_Breeze> he's kind of tired
[7:20:12] <+HawkGoggles2> Still smells like bitch.
[7:20:16] <Triblade1992> Phht, that's cute
[7:20:16] <+Jaysky> "Eh, I'll get him"
[7:20:16] <+polypolipauli> Ani is just tired of this star wars shit
[7:20:18] <mortelkilll> he was kinda random yeah
[7:20:21] <Twad_Feu> Vader practived looking intimidating a lot, he gotta work it
[7:20:22] <dukenux> Vader's weak point is his pathetic walking speed
[7:20:23] <Habblewater> "All I am surrounded by is fear and big fuckin' nerds"
[7:20:26] <mortelkilll> to be fair the actual vilai nwas super lame
[7:20:31] <Snirtax> But if Vader doesn't show up then we have to work with the existing, terrible characters
[7:20:31] <+wcnighthawk125> you had a chance to avenge the jedi
[7:20:36] <Explodincatz> "i have altered the script, pray I do not alter it again"
[7:20:39] <jiin6> vader is on the nose, like burnt skin
[7:20:39] <SuperVaderMan> how'd he get ahead of us LUL
[7:20:39] <MorWakaWaka> darth vader can't move too much because he moves like frankenstein and thats not cool
[7:20:40] <+Reaviar> how did he get there
[7:20:40] <dukenux> its cause his suit is a torture device of space age
[7:20:47] <valhallandoates> you forgot he has his own service elevator
[7:20:48] <jbees7> but throwing bug eyes is the best part
[7:20:48] <+HorribleHog> I clapped when I saw it!
[7:20:49] <%JJCheeker> Nice teleporting
[7:20:50] <LordSDB> Okay that is a straight up Jason right there

[7:21:04] <+wcnighthawk125> just give it to him, it's not worth it
[7:21:04] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> How'd he beat you there?
[7:21:06] <+Shoosler> hahaha
[7:21:07] <cap_bon> when did vader get jason teleporting
[7:21:09] <jiin6> MY SPLEEN
[7:21:10] <Triblade1992> "Reminds me of the time I created C3P0. Remember C3PO?"
[7:21:12] <+wcnighthawk125> make more kids later
[7:21:13] <T_Sasquatch> WHAT ?
[7:21:13] <kiwicoffin> Stupid Vader didn't know it was double sided

[7:22:21] <Twad_Feu> water beat force
[7:22:23] <SuperVaderMan> A Force Forcefield LUL LUL LUL
[7:22:23] <rytisone> it will rust
[7:22:29] <+WaywardSera> this whole base should be imploding right now
[7:22:30] <mortelkilll> my plasticium suit
[7:22:31] <SquigglyLizard> lol
[7:22:33] <MorWakaWaka> a rey shield
[7:22:34] <gordieda20> LUL
[7:22:37] <Habblewater> Cal's solution is to just kill everyone instead of her killing Vader
[7:22:37] <bear_breaker20> that was a wierd transition
[7:22:37] <GarrisonWaifu> "Now i smell like wet burn bacon....NOOOOOOOOOOO"
[7:22:38] <dukenux> Oh no, my cape is all wet, icky
[7:22:38] <ProRJHunter> LUL LUL
[7:22:40] <jiin6> Vader: ahhh i'm not supposed to get water in my suit, oh i hate you guys
[7:22:41] <Virokwet> LUL
[7:22:43] <+wcnighthawk125> lol
[7:22:48] <Triblade1992> I remember when Palps made the suit uncomfortable for Vader just to irritate him
[7:22:49] <Storm_Samurai> LUL LUL LUL
[7:22:51] <+Jaysky> As if she could kill Vader
[7:22:53] <isidore_1869> how Padawan be stronger than the strongest Sith ever ?
[7:22:54] <dukenux> "Oh no, that button started beeping AGAIN"
[7:22:54] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Darth Vader gonna kill you? just block
[7:22:57] <kiwicoffin> The only person worth a shit arrives
[7:22:58] <Twad_Feu> where did she learn to swim?
[7:23:02] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> god, Cal is such a fucking failure
[7:23:07] <jiin6> your in hell
[7:23:08] <mortelkilll> you did it, you survived fan service
[7:23:11] <dukenux> D-Danny DeVito?
[7:23:14] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> how many fucking people with magic powers are there in this game? werent jedi and sith supposed to be special for having powers?
[7:23:15] <Habblewater> I'd wanna die if the first thing i saw was backsack goblin
[7:23:17] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> He *looks* like a failure
[7:23:25] <eccentricprinceofroses> you know what woulda been really helpful during that dungeon? a chick who could teleport
[7:23:28] <hereticalzed2> We couldn't save your pink poncho
[7:23:29] <hereticalzed2> I'm sorry
[7:23:30] <Savior127> And now for the stupidest shit of an ending
[7:23:30] <jiin6> vader took it
[7:23:31] <cap_bon> do crazy bug eyes make you immune to lava
[7:23:33] <+Jaysky> It died in the crash
[7:23:36] <+wcnighthawk125> damn, still in the friendzone
[7:23:37] <DragonBornKing> wow all these characters who dont matter are ok yaay
[7:23:38] <dukenux> It's Vader's now
[7:23:41] <Exadata_> its weird playing a game when you know the ending since, you know, darth vader
[7:23:42] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> that dude is made from every recessive ginger gene left in the galaxy
[7:23:45] <geekjacob> they took it off becaue it looked dumb
[7:23:48] <Habblewater> Bug eyes is immune to die
[7:23:49] <Storm_Samurai> Kiss
[7:23:55] <hereticalzed2> now kis
[7:23:56] <BeatPriestess> Why don't they just make good video games?
[7:24:01] <DragonBornKing> how is he alive
[7:24:04] <MorWakaWaka> I saved you, now you are my wife.
[7:24:04] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Sadly, the pale lady checks off all of my tastes. Weird, pale, goth-ish
[7:24:07] <DragonBornKing> he got stabbed in the heart with a lightsaber
[7:24:14] <%JJCheeker> It's really unrealistic she would like him
[7:24:23] <dukenux> Pale lady reminds me of the Elf sister from Hellboy 2
[7:24:23] <+Jaysky> TheOverwhelmingShotgun witch magic?
[7:24:28] <Habblewater> Let's go to Endor and get fingerblasted by Ewoks
[7:24:31] <Storm_Samurai> Eww
[7:24:33] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Awww free elf Dobby
[7:24:34] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> @Jaysky 100%

[7:24:57] <dukenux> i think Pinhead might want it back
[7:24:57] <gordieda20> Yes
[7:25:00] <MorWakaWaka> they didn't invent usbs yet
[7:25:00] <+TQuick101> there's nothing cool looking about a USB
[7:25:02] <gordieda20> LUL
[7:25:02] <Habblewater> Turns out it's just a cookbook or some shit
[7:25:04] <redrix_3> pdf the damn thing
[7:25:11] <mortelkilll> could have done that way before
[7:25:15] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> I'd ever use a word document f I had holograms
[7:25:18] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> just like have an excel lmao
[7:25:19] <Triblade1992> Yay! Ginger Jedi did the RIGHT THING! He gave the kids a choice!
[7:25:20] <Storm_Samurai> Upload to the Force cloud
[7:25:25] <+Ikari_Sunshine> im super down with space witch titties
[7:25:26] <+Jaysky> The End.
[7:25:27] <%JJCheeker> Oh no the mcmuffin
[7:25:28] <ProRJHunter> LUL LUL
[7:25:29] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> They'll destroy the thing, and plot twist one of thekids is like Rey's relative or Rey herself.
[7:25:30] <redrix_3> what
[7:25:32] <hereticalzed2> The real jedi order was the friends we made along the way
[7:25:32] <Lapinelis> Yup. Nothing of value happened.
[7:25:34] <SquigglyLizard> LUL
[7:25:34] <kiwicoffin> That look of "you motherfucker"
[7:25:34] <+BuriasDempsey> I mean, at least the empire can't get it
[7:25:34] <thepinkone77> Who are you
[7:25:35] <Virokwet> but the frenns we made along the wayyy
[7:25:36] <+bitstorm_> 👀
[7:25:36] <jiin6> Awww helll naaa
[7:25:36] <redrix_3> sorry what
[7:25:38] <Chatterbox1991> thats the end?
[7:25:38] <whirly25> where to now? the opposite direction from the plot
[7:25:38] <dukenux> LUL
[7:25:38] <JoshTheFace> LUL
[7:25:40] <Twad_Feu> well, they denied it from the empire since it was so poorly protected anyway
[7:25:40] <$jobbedbone> GOD WILL FIX THE WORLD FOR US
[7:25:40] <mortelkilll> the empire would have foudn it eventually , but they could have destroyed it as soo nas they found it
[7:25:41] <redrix_3> why
[7:25:42] <Storm_Samurai> Meaningless
[7:25:43] <Habblewater> Kappa
[7:25:44] <+Shoosler> truly we are the star wars jedi fallen order
[7:25:46] <eccentricprinceofroses> bitch WHAT
[7:25:47] <TheOverwhelmingShotgun> Her bug eyes really sell the comedy
[7:25:50] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> Congratulations
[7:25:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> YEAH FUCK THE JEDI ORDER
[7:25:51] <dukenux> "We could sell this for millions"
[7:25:52] <Sapphire_Breeze> what was the point of this plot
[7:25:54] <MorWakaWaka> thats why these midquels suck, they never amount to anything.
[7:25:54] <Triblade1992> At least Ginger Jedi gave the kids a choice
[7:25:55] <+Jaysky> The sequel is about us getting into the witch gf's sheets
[7:25:57] <redrix_3> rate this game out of 10
[7:26:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> Why would we try
[7:26:02] <+Ikari_Sunshine> thanks for your money
[7:26:02] <%JJCheeker> Dear Lord awful story
[7:26:02] <LordSDB> Darth Vader was cool though
[7:26:02] <chronoxgp> you stopped the NSA
[7:26:04] <+Zerodyne90> enjoy 5h of credits
[7:26:06] <+bitstorm_> just leave it to Jesus to sort out
[7:26:07] <bear_breaker20> kids lives were sparred chat
[7:26:07] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Some say Darth Vader is still force holding back water to this day
[7:26:13] <jiin6> Vader: i hate Gingers sooo many
[7:26:19] <dukenux> It has Darth Vader, so 10/10 tho
[7:26:20] <Psyramics> Fallen Order 2 is just Escape from Vader
[7:26:24] <rytisone> when will the endgame reward be sex
[7:26:27] <mortelkilll> could have been a worse ending
[7:26:27] <simulationbard> So what do these assholes between now for the rest of the series. Do they just fuck off to the edge of space where are they
[7:26:28] <kiwicoffin> Can't wait for the sequel
[7:26:32] <canisdyluna> killing BD what have done that moment one
[7:26:33] <Sapphire_Breeze> it was a product
[7:26:33] <mortelkilll> like them recruiting the kids for the jedi
[7:26:34] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> ehhh it was fine
[7:26:36] <SuperVaderMan> I clapped when I saw Darth Vadeerrrrrrrrr
[7:26:36] <MESeele> dream sequence game
[7:26:37] <hereticalzed2> It was Adequate.
[7:26:37] <jiin6> meh
[7:26:38] <eccentricprinceofroses> boooooo
[7:26:39] <+Ikari_Sunshine> Solid Eh/10
[7:26:39] <redrix_3> 5/10
[7:26:39] <kiwicoffin> There is NONE. Go EAT
[7:26:40] <hereticalzed2> There isn't one
[7:26:40] <+TQuick101> it's the best star wars game in a long time
[7:26:40] <ProRJHunter> It was ok.
[7:26:41] <+HawkGoggles2> But the kids. Kappa
[7:26:42] <+HorribleHog> We can have a franchise where the characters die off one by one because they can't be alive in New Hope
[7:26:42] <Savior127> there is not after credits
[7:26:42] <$jobbedbone> 4/10
[7:26:43] <dukenux> It's still the best SW game in years LUL
[7:26:43] <Virokwet> i was fun
[7:26:45] <Chatterbox1991> @PlagueOfGripes that felt like it was cut for time
[7:26:45] <Murphio_GS> Yeah that was pretty vapid
[7:26:47] <+polypolipauli> I'm so happy you streamed for us today Plague
[7:26:48] <@Nightbot> @Alzero83 -> Too easy. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[7:26:48] <gordieda20> it's ok
[7:26:49] <+bitstorm_> EVUL / 10
[7:26:49] <jiin6> there isn't a after credit scene
[7:26:49] <+Jaysky> Game is fine/good
[7:26:51] <Triblade1992> I thought att least the Ginger Jedi did the right thing and gave those kids a choice @PlagueOfGripes
[7:26:52] <Snirtax> It's mediocre but overrated because everything else star wars has been so shit
[7:26:52] <Exadata_> but darth vader killed all the jedi, so all this characters are dead
[7:26:53] <Helil0> opening was to fast. wished they fleshed out the cast
[7:26:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> 3/10
[7:26:55] <geekjacob> 4.5
[7:26:57] <bear_breaker20> salright, pay your testers
[7:26:58] <canisdyluna> a 3
[7:26:59] <LordSDB> 7/10 not the worst but could use some work
[7:26:59] <cap_bon> solid eh/10
[7:27:01] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> better than the usual Star Wars products
[7:27:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its a 7
[7:27:05] <T_Sasquatch> It was fine a serviceable 7/10
[7:27:05] <jiin6> Jank/100
[7:27:06] <+BuriasDempsey> its ok at least
[7:27:06] <+Firemane1279> "This crazy Honky just wasted our entire time" LUL LUL LUL
[7:27:07] <Savior127> 6/10 is the best I can give
[7:27:07] <dukenux> It's fine for like a renting
[7:27:08] <Chatterbox1991> 6 to 7
[7:27:08] <SuperVaderMan> This game is Bland/10
[7:27:08] <mortelkilll> eh/10
[7:27:09] <Snirtax> 5/10
[7:27:10] <kiwicoffin> I can appreciate this crew of minorities trying
[7:27:10] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Game is a solid 7
[7:27:11] <zk_nails> 7.8
[7:27:15] <dukenux> the ol classic 7/10
[7:27:15] <+Jaysky> It's very decent
[7:27:16] <$doomp12> 6.5/10
[7:27:17] <redrix_3> five is an average game on my scale
[7:27:17] <Exadata_> i wanna de dark souls/10
[7:27:19] <T_Sasquatch> Ita a very 7/10 game
[7:27:19] <+Ikari_Sunshine> it was a star wars i guess
[7:27:19] <+Engwithan_Elder_God> Star Wars / 10
[7:27:22] <+HorribleHog> 4.5/10
[7:27:22] <Lapinelis> This is a "Needs 6 more monrhts of work and an editor"/10
[7:27:24] <+Jaysky> Yes
[7:27:25] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> it looks like7/10 just because of the sheer ammount of money put into it
[7:27:26] <%JJCheeker> I would say 6
[7:27:29] <+Jaysky> It's a very plain game
[7:27:30] <+TheStarvingGood> the combat is so disappointing tho
[7:27:30] <SquigglyLizard> 6.7
[7:27:31] <Alzero83> yovgStare yovgStare
[7:27:32] <Triblade1992> 6/10 is fine. 7/10 is decent
[7:27:36] <jiin6> a yms 7
[7:27:36] <grander76> 6.5
[7:27:37] <%JJCheeker> It's pretty average
[7:27:39] <dukenux> I think we should make 6 the new 7
[7:27:40] <ProRJHunter> 6/10
[7:27:40] <+HawkGoggles2> Use the whole scale.
[7:27:41] <+bitstorm_> Repulsive NPCs / 10
[7:27:42] <eccentricprinceofroses> I would say 7/10 if the souls games and proper soulslikes didnt exist
[7:27:48] <%JJCheeker> 6 is still OK
[7:27:50] <Snirtax> It's so soulless though. There's absolutely nothing original about it
[7:27:52] <Chatterbox1991> its very very good for an EA game
[7:27:52] <Twad_Feu> remove the fanboi factor and its a reasonably good game, but nothing special
[7:27:54] <A_High_Ordinator> 5.9/10
[7:27:54] <rytisone> Jesus
[7:27:55] <Savior127> 6 is a one shot deal. 7 would at least have something you would want to go back to.
[7:27:56] <redrix_3> but every boss was just ASS
[7:28:01] <+Jaysky> The game is functional, it does Star Wars very Star Wars-y.
[7:28:05] <eccentricprinceofroses> idk why you would play this over any other prayy/dodgeroll game
[7:28:16] <eccentricprinceofroses> *parry
[7:28:17] <+RAAAAAINMAKER> It was a good Star Wars game but not a good game
[7:28:18] <SuperVaderMan> Weakest Jedi protagonist in a video game?
[7:28:18] <xtremegamer80> 7/10, it may not be the best game but it’s clear that there are people who liked Star Wars who worked on this game
[7:28:20] <+Jaysky> eccentricprinceofroses , Star Wars.
[7:28:31] <+Ikari_Sunshine> can we just get another KOTOR like game
[7:28:34] <+ultimatetotoro> damn
[7:28:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Oh man force unleashed boss fights were so shit.
[7:28:41] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> it's like the opposite of a Sekiro bossfight
[7:28:45] <+ultimatetotoro> did plague just finish this game?
[7:28:46] <dukenux> TBH i enjoyed the SW atmosphere in this than most of new movies LUL so maybe it does deserve that 7/10
[7:28:48] <bear_breaker20> very uncharted
[7:28:52] <$jobbedbone> sounds like my wife
[7:28:53] <sonofthedeepsouth> So Plague play terminator resistance. Its actually decent
[7:28:55] <+Dr_DangerPhD> The game seems really front loaded in terms of quality
[7:28:59] <MassConnect> the force has a power creep problem
[7:29:01] <dukenux> remember Sekiro?
[7:29:03] <%JJCheeker> It has a lot of elements from other games that do it better
[7:29:06] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> sekiro lets you have a lot of fun with the bossfights wtf you talkin about
[7:29:08] <Storm_Samurai> 6 more months in the oven would polish some of the jank
[7:29:10] <canisdyluna> a game that plays badly.. bad game, yes i know only a sith deals in absolutes
[7:29:23] <cap_bon> are we cursed to have vader cameo in every star wars media ever
[7:29:27] <DragonBornKing> i enjoyed force unleashed more
[7:29:28] <Snirtax> It really feels like it should've been way more sekiro, with the stamina being the healthbar. Break it, and you slice the enemy in half in one go. You know, like an actual lightsaber
[7:29:30] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Ever try Hollow Knight?
[7:29:34] <dukenux> Avellone???
[7:29:38] <Savior127> So I gives it a 6 as its a functionally competent but platonic game.
[7:29:41] <redrix_3> god i do love hollow knight
[7:29:44] <+HorribleHog> You weren't doing anything that wasn't already done better in Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy
[7:29:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> Play hollow of the knights plague
[7:29:47] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> @Snirtax yup
[7:29:47] <$jobbedbone> sekiro has a sane stamina/guard system. this seemed unworkable
[7:29:48] <Chatterbox1991> Everytime i see Vader in a Star Wars game, i want to see more of Vader in a non-combat role; him actually having a personality and interacting with people
[7:29:56] <redrix_3> so go play hollow knight now
[7:30:00] <bear_breaker20> dont either way lol
[7:30:00] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Pale King did nothing wrong
[7:30:07] <xtremegamer80> @chatterbox1991 Read the comics
[7:30:10] <sonofthedeepsouth> Its another okay game
[7:30:12] <bear_breaker20> dont touch unleashed
[7:30:17] <redrix_3> big sad
[7:30:17] <whirly25> unleashed was 8/10
[7:30:25] <sonofthedeepsouth> Force Unleashed bosses are shit
[7:30:25] <Chatterbox1991> Unleashed is pretty Ok
[7:30:28] <redrix_3> reach was fun
[7:30:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> Except Kassus
[7:30:38] <+HorribleHog> I want a rewrite of ep 1-3
[7:30:38] <+Dr_DangerPhD> Unleashed is the definition of ok, not great but not bad either
[7:30:39] <+CharredChord> sorry nothing
[7:30:40] <rytisone> big 'ol nothing
[7:30:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> The Junk Jedi is cool
[7:30:41] <%JJCheeker> That's fine
[7:30:42] <geekjacob> you get nothing good day sir
[7:30:47] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> yeah vader being an imposing polititian/military man is cool but it never happens in games
[7:30:49] <+Ikari_Sunshine> nothing is good
[7:30:50] <Chatterbox1991> @PlagueOfGripes the Ultimate Edition adds a lot i can recommend
[7:30:55] <+HorribleHog> It ended on a freezeframe
[7:30:56] <Triblade1992> maybe after
[7:31:03] <rytisone> before final mission
[7:31:06] <SuperVaderMan> Just to let you 100%
[7:31:16] <Chatterbox1991> I HATE THAT
[7:31:18] <Chatterbox1991> THE REWIND
[7:31:20] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[7:31:21] <Chatterbox1991> US SO LAZY
[7:31:26] <+HawkGoggles2> the true Jedi are the Sith we killed along the way.
[7:31:27] <sonofthedeepsouth> WHATA REWARD
[7:31:28] <bear_breaker20> poncho time endgame
[7:31:35] <$jobbedbone> that means there can be 0 collectables in the fortress?
[7:31:35] <juxtest> that holocron contained the location of every poncho in the galaxy
[7:31:35] <+HorribleHog> 4.5/10
[7:31:45] <+HorribleHog> gnight
[7:31:53] <BeatPriestess> What was it about this game that made it worth $60?
[7:31:53] <DragonBornKing> she isnt furry enough for plague
[7:31:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> oof
[7:31:55] <%Samex_Comex> goodbye greez
[7:32:00] <+TQuick101> in this universe, a 6/10 is like a 9/10 anywhere else
[7:32:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> A 6 girls hate being 6
[7:32:11] <dukenux> It's the least EA game from EA in a while
[7:32:15] <Chatterbox1991> @PlagueOfGripes i would say take a look at FOrce Unleashed just for the Hoth Epilogue
[7:32:20] <xtremegamer80> There are clear issues but it’s not Battlefront or the nu-Trilogy
[7:32:24] <Mc_weak_to_arrow> it's definitely a game that runs on a computer
[7:32:24] <Chatterbox1991> that shit makes it all worth it
[7:32:25] <redrix_3> without a doubt a 7/10 for an ea game
[7:32:27] <bear_breaker20> support what EA wont**
[7:32:28] <dukenux> It sure is a SW video game
[7:32:30] <rytisone> now to run Respawn into the ground
[7:32:31] <Triblade1992> EA: *Pikachu face when they see people being more praisworthy than anything they ahve done*
[7:32:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Video game/10
[7:32:37] <Snirtax> Honestly I still have no faith, just because that game has absolutely no originality to it. All they managed to do was make a decent rehash of better games
[7:32:42] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Cool.
[7:32:44] <Chatterbox1991> niiight plague!
[7:32:50] <+Gabriel_Wright_Dunn> Have a good night.
