[0:01:11] <Triblade1992> I heard this was a decent game
[0:01:20] <@dcn2049> They've been trying to kill Respawn for awhile now
[0:01:34] <zamzoph> DO IT
[0:01:42] <Triblade1992> Jedi master seems the most challenging
[0:01:48] <kylecoolperson> i heard this was a "Souls-like" game
[0:01:59] <ThatGuyThere03> I can't wait for this play nothing like an actual souls game besides the camera
[0:02:21] <@dcn2049> Mmm drugs
[0:02:31] <%bettysharkface> Would you consider streaming Disco Elysium some day?
[0:02:42] <Triblade1992> Sounds good.
[0:02:42] <%bettysharkface> Volume is fine.
[0:02:47] <ziggyjesus> Can you specifically customize difficulty settings like enemy aggression and parry timing?
[0:02:54] <ThatGuyThere03> Your mic is slightly louder than the game, but both are coming in fine
[0:02:58] <@dcn2049> Yeah you're good
[0:03:10] <ziggyjesus> Mongoliaaaa
[0:03:16] <ThatGuyThere03> look at all that star wars

[0:03:23] <ThatGuyThere03> you saw it
[0:03:39] <b1nahthearbiter> Allo
[0:03:43] <KellBeII> so what, is this taking place right after episode 3?
[0:03:49] <+CyberRonin3> cyberronin3 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:03:54] <Triblade1992> I think it's some kind of universal translator stuff
[0:04:12] <%bettysharkface> He looks familiar...
[0:04:13] <ThatGuyThere03> Rent-a-Luke lookin ass
[0:04:14] <Triblade1992> Yes, there is an inquisitor stuff
[0:04:21] <%bettysharkface> I know what it is.
[0:04:28] <coke_monster> Just got here. Have we bowed to our mouse overlord yet?
[0:04:31] <Triblade1992> I like the cinematic cutscene first in JRPGs though
[0:04:34] <%bettysharkface> He looks like Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon
[0:04:40] <+hgtarras> Is this pc?
[0:04:41] <@dcn2049> hah
[0:04:44] <ThatGuyThere03> When does he straddle Mickey's shaft?
[0:05:12] <ziggyjesus> Wonder how this will be reviewed compared to the Force Unleashed games
[0:05:15] <KellBeII> i bet that cough isnt nothing
[0:05:23] <deadstrat> Is this assassins creed in star wars
[0:05:55] <coke_monster> This is not up to OSHA standards.
[0:06:00] <ThatGuyThere03> BANTHA POODOO SHE SAID IT
[0:06:01] <%hgtarras> hgtarras subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Have you watched mandalorian?
[0:06:02] <ThatGuyThere03> I CLAPPED
[0:06:38] <+FordR> I’m ready for product.
[0:06:42] <ThatGuyThere03> because they're about to break it down for scrap
[0:06:45] <@Nightbot> @piggypig -> Nightbot one, bad guys zero. [stop spamming emotes] [warning]
[0:06:45] <biomegabear> Are you making your star wars OC ?
[0:06:45] <Triblade1992> Remember when George Lucas sweeped all of this under the rug in Episode 3?
[0:06:47] <KellBeII> oh its the half eaton donut with the donut hole in the middle
[0:06:49] <cap_bon> imagine having to climb up shit like taht on a day to day basis
[0:06:51] <+xanochoy> it was just 18 years ago
[0:07:00] <ahegotrigger> yeah this is post republic
[0:07:03] <AnacondaVirtue> Why blow it up when you can salvage it. Also this isn't too long before the OT, I think
[0:07:04] <+xanochoy> takes time to scrap a ship
[0:07:08] <ziggyjesus> I thought this was just after order 66
[0:07:12] <+nesence2> Its a ship breaking yard
[0:07:15] <MKUltima> Would a contrived plot device in Star Wars be Forced
[0:07:27] <coke_monster> @mkultima Boo.
[0:07:28] <ThatGuyThere03> he's got megaman jumps
[0:07:32] <b1nahthearbiter> Seperatist droids had best empire
[0:07:34] <piggypig> i think its some time after episode 3, after the empire established itself
[0:07:44] <LordPubious> is this kid nobility? that's one heck of a habsburg jaw
[0:08:12] <Triblade1992> Jedi: "WHEEEEEEEE!"
[0:08:27] <piggypig> plague use your gamer instincts
[0:08:31] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Salutations, Plague & Chat. How goes the gaming
[0:08:42] <+commanderclaw> Yeah, it's pretty on rails
[0:08:42] <ziggyjesus> I would be wary of taking a slide here, one could go right to a trash compactor
[0:08:45] <Triblade1992> Skyrim let you do TOO much though
[0:08:51] <ThatGuyThere03> there's physics objects, there's 100% gonna be Skyrim stuff
[0:08:56] <piggypig> weeee
[0:08:57] <Triblade1992> And look at what happened with Bethesda's other games
[0:09:00] <coke_monster> gg
[0:09:01] <b1nahthearbiter> complete OSHA violation
[0:09:04] <AnacondaVirtue> It's Uncharted/TLOU rules. All climbing is cinematic filter.
[0:09:14] <SuperVaderMan> Good mindread, main character
[0:09:26] <+commanderclaw> Who's a good Jedi? You are, yes you are!
[0:09:35] <ThatGuyThere03> As all things should
[0:09:39] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Yes, acknowledge your lack of worth
[0:09:51] <coke_monster> Weak ass dash dance.
[0:09:53] <ThatGuyThere03> oof that rope
[0:10:09] <stranger59> Romance a droid.
[0:10:18] <piggypig> alien lamguage indeed
[0:10:28] <SuperVaderMan> star wars is at it's best when it looks lived-in
[0:10:46] <piggypig> that alirn language sounds mexican
[0:10:48] <Triblade1992> At this point, the movies are basically "Can you entertain me? And if so, how?" At least I was being entertained with TFA and TLJ.
[0:10:48] <ziggyjesus> Thanks Plague, I am waiting until Death Stranding drops in price before I buy it, pls no spoilers.
[0:10:49] <truegrumpyniko> this looks pretty solid
[0:10:50] <LordPubious> I like to think the empire pilfer all the good resources so everywhere else is just made from a bunch of junk
[0:11:27] <Eirykr> ??????
[0:11:36] <ThatGuyThere03> I think you've done more experimentation with the controls than 99% of people playing already
[0:11:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:12:03] <SuperVaderMan> steve blum?
[0:12:06] <MKUltima> Finish up the job then go to Omega for some Asarii
[0:12:08] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Never was much into Star Wars, but am I supposed to get a "everyone is living by the skn of their teeth" vibe?
[0:12:09] <Triblade1992> Steve Blum
[0:12:11] <President_valentine> Steve Blum
[0:12:19] <ThatGuyThere03> Isn't he also Sub-Zero now?
[0:12:20] <b1nahthearbiter> Take your time Plague
[0:12:23] <NickHatesSnow> steve blum
[0:12:25] <ThatGuyThere03> and Amon
[0:12:29] <ThatGuyThere03> and a bunch of other shit
[0:12:53] <+brave_sj> Star Wars has such wild and crazy space fantasies, like hyperspace and finishing a job ahead of schedule
[0:12:56] <SuperVaderMan> I appreciate that gonk
[0:13:00] <+brave_sj> GONK
[0:13:01] <ThatGuyThere03> the trash can droid?
[0:13:03] <KellBeII> gonk droid
[0:13:10] <+nesence2> theyre mobile fusion generators
[0:13:12] <piggypig> ITS GONK
[0:13:14] <+nesence2> the move pwoer
[0:13:14] <+C24U> Dick sucking droids
[0:13:16] <piggypig> i clapped
[0:13:20] <Triblade1992> What's funny is how this tutorial is very much Uncharted. but then it is full blown Dark Souls
[0:13:22] <ziggyjesus> Two midgets in a trash can
[0:13:32] <AnacondaVirtue> Apparently Gonk Droids are mobile generators? At least I remember reading something to that effect
[0:13:34] <deadstrat> Seemless
[0:13:44] <Triblade1992> FF15 did that stuff with dungeons
[0:13:44] <b1nahthearbiter> i smell a lot of workplace violations commited in the last 10 minutes
[0:14:09] <SuperVaderMan> I guess this is just your normal commute
[0:14:10] <ThatGuyThere03> is there no fucking stairs in this place?
[0:14:12] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> !uptime
[0:14:12] <@Nightbot> 14 minutes 24 seconds
[0:14:18] <KellBeII> hes champin for a clampin
[0:14:21] <b1nahthearbiter> Where are the work safety helmets?
[0:14:25] <truegrumpyniko> its very star wars junk planet
[0:14:33] <Sol_Cataphract> so you gotta be some kind of acrobat to work in this place?
[0:14:34] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Oh, wow, I thought the stream had been going longer
[0:14:36] <Lkprime> "the clamps" sounds like a VERY specific strip club
[0:14:37] <truegrumpyniko> They typically never have any fucking safety regulations because theres no one there to give a shit
[0:14:44] <ThatGuyThere03> THE CLAMPS
[0:14:54] <truegrumpyniko> See Darth Banes home world in his books
[0:15:02] <Triblade1992> Somewhere out there, Mara Jade is in this galaxy. Maybe Lucasfilm cam reboot the Thrawn Trilogy and make it like the Mandelorian for 3 seasons
[0:15:40] <SuperVaderMan> what if they're trying to look menacing and still doofy
[0:15:42] <President_valentine> like the really tiny ones
[0:15:55] <ThatGuyThere03> HOW IS THIS NORMAL
[0:16:13] <stranger59> Everyone loves orange buttcheeks
[0:16:21] <ThatGuyThere03> it's true
[0:16:30] <ThatGuyThere03> that's why Clone Wars was so widely loves
[0:16:31] <Triblade1992> I see. Luke is probably going to meet Barriss Offee and Ahsoka and him are probably going to fight Barriss post ROTJ
[0:16:46] <ziggyjesus> "Luke, have I ever told you about Ahsoka Tano? She was a good friend"
[0:16:50] <SuperVaderMan> I know what that is! PogChamp
[0:16:59] <+brave_sj> That is pretty neat though
[0:17:07] <Laecerelius> Slap that giant lightsaber onto a robot!
[0:17:07] <piggypig> oh thats a republic style ship
[0:17:10] <Triblade1992> Barriss was MIA since Clone Wars which is Lucasfilm talk for "We got plans for her post RotJ"
[0:17:23] <+brave_sj> Fuck man they got AT-TEs down there
[0:17:30] <stranger59> They reattach it to cut it off again.
[0:17:36] <SuperVaderMan> oops LUL
[0:17:57] <ziggyjesus> Space Hind Gunship
[0:18:00] <+nesence2> b1s
[0:18:09] <Sol_Cataphract> tentacles down there too
[0:18:09] <KellBeII> that one helmet has a blaster shot on the face
[0:18:11] <Lkprime> no that's what they're called
[0:18:14] <+brave_sj> Imagine living in a world where massive walking tanks that can climb at a 90 degree angle are milsurp
[0:18:14] <piggypig> roger roger
[0:18:15] <The_Swedish_X> Mandalorian ad just before I got to the stream proper.
[0:18:17] <The_Swedish_X> Apt.
[0:18:20] <stranger59> I lived love enough for people to become nostalgic for clone wars stuff.
[0:18:21] <LordPubious> they lost to Jar Jar, I'm not surprised they scraped them
[0:18:27] <KellBeII> this is a cool setting for a game
[0:18:28] <ThatGuyThere03> imagine not having uBlock
[0:18:44] <SuperVaderMan> Oh hi sarlaaac
[0:18:46] <Triblade1992> @stranger59 That's due to the cartoon, the movies are only nostalgic for the 5-12 year olds who watched it
[0:19:00] <+ghostmutton> Being a scrapper seems to require extreme physical fitness
[0:19:17] <AnacondaVirtue> My assumption has always been certain aliens can understand basic, but don't have the vocal organs to replicate
[0:19:32] <stranger59> @Triblade1992 The cartoon and some of the videogames. I can hate Ep 1 all day, but I love a good podrace.
[0:19:56] <The_Swedish_X> This seems... unnecessary.
[0:20:01] <Triblade1992> Episode 3 had good ideas, just poor execution
[0:20:15] <deadstrat> wait thats HIS voice?!
[0:20:18] <+nesence2> why would you have to climb onto the clamp to operate it?
[0:20:19] <ThatGuyThere03> why are these clamps designed like this?
[0:20:29] <LordPubious> the Gendy Tartakovsky Clone Wars series was pretty good
[0:20:37] <ziggyjesus> Imagine nonstop messing with your coworkers with the force
[0:20:38] <Triblade1992> Wasn't the Jedi suppose to be more of a legend at this point?
[0:20:39] <stranger59> Is there still Jedi goo inside?
[0:20:44] <The_Swedish_X> Junk can go far.
[0:20:48] <KellBeII> that plo koons fighter?
[0:20:50] <piggypig> so 5 years after episode 3
[0:21:03] <stranger59> Legend = 19 years ago
[0:21:09] <ThatGuyThere03> it's almost like they were a secluded order of monastic monks
[0:21:14] <ThatGuyThere03> funny how that came and went
[0:21:26] <truegrumpyniko> this guy seems nice
[0:21:28] <ahegotrigger> true
[0:21:30] <+nesence2> man thisfriend dudes gunna die so hard
[0:21:30] <CaptainSkelly> Heyoo
[0:21:37] <CaptainSkelly> I hear this game is actually pretty good 👀
[0:21:47] <LordPubious> I can't stop staring at this kids habsburg jaw
[0:21:47] <The_Swedish_X> Hey man. His culture probably praises having a big ballsack head. You don't know.
[0:21:50] <LordPubious> it consumes me
[0:22:04] <ahegotrigger> it looks alot more fun than Death stranding imo
[0:22:05] <ThatGuyThere03> your ass would be destroyed on this
[0:22:06] <SuperVaderMan> it's uncharted-y
[0:22:16] <Triblade1992> reminds me of when Luke fell down in Cloud City
[0:22:17] <ThatGuyThere03> yes you can
[0:22:18] <deadstrat> This is like that one scene from Tomb Raider
[0:22:21] <ThatGuyThere03> stop playing
[0:22:22] <Triblade1992> and how he slid
[0:22:23] <+nesence2> man thats gunna cause some rug burn
[0:22:28] <ahegotrigger> just dont fall and die
[0:22:29] <ThatGuyThere03> byyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee
[0:22:39] <deadstrat> hhaa
[0:22:39] <ahegotrigger> god he ate shit
[0:22:42] <LordPubious> time to be digested for a thousand years
[0:22:44] <ziggyjesus> Convenient droid right there
[0:22:47] <+commanderclaw> Nothing a spine replacement won't fix
[0:22:52] <The_Swedish_X> Probably should be dead anyway.
[0:22:59] <ralphwiggum16> hey plague, do you believe in the force?
[0:23:04] <+C24U> Dead
[0:23:04] <ThatGuyThere03> man did Jedi ever figure out how to fly?
[0:23:07] <AnacondaVirtue> Why didn't they exterminate this incredibly dangerous alien two feet away from their scrapping site
[0:23:19] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Whoever Cal's VA is, he ain't putting much effort into emoting
[0:23:20] <Triblade1992> Uncharted territory and all that
[0:23:25] <ziggyjesus> That spy droid was just in the right place to see Cal use the force
[0:23:40] <Triblade1992> ^ this
[0:23:53] <ziggyjesus> It's only been 5 years, people still know about the jedis and force
[0:23:59] <The_Swedish_X> He seems to have worked there for many many years.
[0:24:01] <ThatGuyThere03> Oh hey Geordi
[0:24:03] <+brave_sj> HEY BUDDY, ARE YOU ONE A THEM WANTED FELONS?
[0:24:03] <Triblade1992> After STD, right?
[0:24:06] <truegrumpyniko> I shouldnt watch any more of this, i think i'll enjoy it
[0:24:09] <The_Swedish_X> Not much to know or learn.
[0:24:20] <AnacondaVirtue> Star Trek's too busy with explosions and punching to need engineers
[0:24:22] <ThatGuyThere03> STOP
[0:24:28] <LordPubious> the seam
[0:24:28] <shevan123> is that the same voiceacter from prey, your brother?
[0:24:29] <truegrumpyniko> HeyGuys HeyGuys
[0:24:31] <%Rezca> So Jedi are mutant genetic freaks
[0:24:33] <Jontman42> it does
[0:24:41] <deadstrat> ???
[0:24:43] <ralphwiggum16> are there any force goblins in this game?
[0:24:47] <Triblade1992> Hey, better than being a racial stereotype like in the prequels
[0:24:50] <AnacondaVirtue> What buttholes have you been looking at, Plague
[0:24:51] <SuperVaderMan> His whole head is a genital smorgasbord
[0:25:11] <Longerbone_ghm> Truly the ultimate orifice
[0:25:16] <TheAsylumCat> you calling him a fuck face
[0:25:16] <ThatGuyThere03> it really doesnt
[0:25:21] <ThatGuyThere03> he's waaaayyyyyy too generic
[0:25:24] <SuperVaderMan> Bigger eyes = more endearment
[0:25:36] <MKUltima> He was never there
[0:25:36] <shevan123> yeah what kind of buttholes are you used to plague
[0:25:43] <+tuneforeverfree> I'll buy it if they add NG plus
[0:25:43] <Triblade1992> I'm the opposite, I like a specific character designs
[0:25:43] <The_Swedish_X> Of course, he'd be portrayed even more generic.
[0:25:47] <SuperVaderMan> GONK
[0:25:48] <KellBeII> pet the gonk droid
[0:25:51] <AnacondaVirtue> Look at that good robo boy
[0:25:51] <Triblade1992> GONK
[0:25:56] <+brave_sj> G O N K
[0:25:57] <ralphwiggum16> STOP YELLING AT HIM PLAGUE, HE'S NOT REAL
[0:25:58] <villainous_quel> gronk?
[0:25:59] <Lkprime> GONK
[0:25:59] <+Punishedkaiger> GONK
[0:26:05] <+Thechessdragon> GONK
[0:26:07] <coke_monster> Gronk... :)?
[0:26:08] <The_Swedish_X> What do gonks even do?
[0:26:10] <shevan123> gronk?
[0:26:14] <+nesence2> theyre actually really useful as IEDs.
[0:26:25] <Triblade1992> This might be the looping train cart
[0:26:33] <shevan123> oh shit its the FORCE
[0:26:36] <+brave_sj> Is Prauf ratting you out?
[0:26:38] <Sol_Cataphract> is he betraying you?
[0:26:39] <ziggyjesus> A cutscene, but you're still in control, so it's not a cutscene
[0:26:59] <The_Swedish_X> and now for death and/or betrayal.
[0:27:00] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Just you watch, our buddy's gonna be outed as "The Spy who came to care too much"
[0:27:01] <coke_monster> Gibber-fiddy
[0:27:02] <ralphwiggum16> i give this game a 2/10
[0:27:06] <President_valentine> he's going to sell you out
[0:27:16] <Triblade1992> yep, dream sequence
[0:27:16] <deadstrat> WWOW
[0:27:18] <SuperVaderMan> This train just got a lot more fancy PogChamp
[0:27:21] <+brave_sj> Nah, dream sequence
[0:27:25] <Jontman42> neat
[0:27:27] <Triblade1992> NICE
[0:27:27] <coke_monster> Damn.
[0:27:33] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> The cliche is strong
[0:27:47] <coke_monster> God damn Gwyndolin.
[0:27:52] <+brave_sj> Empire bulkheads are the coolest bulkheads
[0:27:54] <stranger59> They Evil Within'd you.
[0:27:59] <ralphwiggum16> this is visually so impressive
[0:28:05] <Triblade1992> YEah, it's his species which went into hiding
[0:28:13] <+Thechessdragon> Yuri
[0:28:23] <Triblade1992> YEP
[0:28:26] <stranger59> He's one of them, yeah.
[0:28:32] <Triblade1992> I think this was before that though
[0:28:41] <ThatGuyThere03> yo those helmets were neat
[0:28:46] <ziggyjesus> New OC stormtrooper variant
[0:28:47] <Lkprime> I think that was after the clone wars ended
[0:28:53] <The_Swedish_X> does the prior lore actual matter in this game?
[0:29:00] <AnacondaVirtue> I know I'm probably in the minority in here, but I HATE her helmet
[0:29:00] <coke_monster> Im ready for new toy line up hoh boy.
[0:29:10] <SuperVaderMan> second sister LUL
[0:29:11] <stranger59> Basically, yeah. though I guess a few could still be out.
[0:29:12] <+brave_sj> Eh bb u got an inquisition 4 me?
[0:29:14] <Triblade1992> you ever wonder if ANY of these Inquistors would be Barriss Offee?
[0:29:17] <ReNhoSoft1> nah, those side things are shields that act as landing gear, theyre not necessary I guess
[0:29:22] <The_Swedish_X> Can you speak up, miss?
[0:29:26] <+C24U> Plague's next art subject
[0:29:26] <deadstrat> what a silly title
[0:29:31] <ralphwiggum16> your mom's a hot inquisitor
[0:29:35] <President_valentine> that's a big boy
[0:29:38] <+nesence2> will they fly via their lightsabers
[0:29:42] <ahegotrigger> I like her design overall
[0:29:49] <The_Swedish_X> Look at these boss fights.
[0:29:53] <eldragon_1> She kinda reminds me of the Founder from DS9
[0:29:54] <piggypig> oh
[0:29:55] <ziggyjesus> The big alien inquisitor looks like he's from Ratchet and Clank
[0:29:57] <piggypig> i understand now
[0:30:00] <piggypig> hes danny trejo
[0:30:18] <ThatGuyThere03> he's stalling
[0:30:21] <ralphwiggum16> EXECUTION
[0:30:22] <ziggyjesus> Shoot him while he's monologuing
[0:30:37] <The_Swedish_X> Gotta motivate the player.
[0:30:39] <deadstrat> Just Kill him already
[0:30:42] <cap_bon> Im sparticus
[0:30:43] <ahegotrigger> damn
[0:30:46] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> I'm surprised she let him speak so long
[0:30:47] <LordPubious> was that a Twi-lek with a hat on? Now i've seen everything
[0:30:50] <deadstrat> Defak
[0:30:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Man that is an even dumber double light saber
[0:31:01] <ThatGuyThere03> dead
[0:31:02] <ThatGuyThere03> he's dead
[0:31:03] <Triblade1992> I HATE those Inquistor lightsabers. WORST LIGHTSABER
[0:31:04] <ThatGuyThere03> he died
[0:31:07] <%Rezca> why did he get thrown over?
[0:31:08] <ahegotrigger> thats so dumb
[0:31:09] <ThatGuyThere03> game's over
[0:31:12] <Jontman42> should've gone for the hand
[0:31:17] <ziggyjesus> OHHHH, She has that dumb helicopter lightsaber
[0:31:24] <+nesence2> wow, lets make sure we can't confirm the kill.
[0:31:33] <Triblade1992> lol
[0:31:35] <ReNhoSoft1> Why kill the protagonist? Nah, let me hang him here instead
[0:31:37] <SuperVaderMan> Poor guys LUL
[0:31:40] <ahegotrigger> JEDI
[0:31:40] <piggypig> JEDI!!
[0:31:45] <Lkprime> I actually kinda enjoy how stupid and absurd the Inquisitor lightsabers are
[0:31:47] <KellBeII> they didnt deserve it
[0:31:48] <deadstrat> Well
[0:31:50] <ahegotrigger> did I hear JEDI
[0:31:53] <piggypig> video games
[0:31:54] <The_Swedish_X> they might as well have just auto played that for you after that.
[0:31:55] <President_valentine> let's stare at him
[0:31:58] <The_Swedish_X> silly games.
[0:32:01] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> No lightsaber dismemberment: 1/10
[0:32:01] <Triblade1992> You could have just programed something in FOR THIS SCENARIO. This is why cutscenes would have worked here
[0:32:03] <CaptainSkelly> Hey i found the jedi we've been looking for i'm gonna throw him off the cliff
[0:32:04] <CaptainSkelly> ????
[0:32:09] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[0:32:12] <ziggyjesus> I wanna see Second sister fly with her dumb lightsaber
[0:32:12] <stranger59> Beautiful
[0:32:16] <piggypig> get that flat top
[0:32:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that light saber feel like a terrible hybrid of the double light saber and a keyblade, with it's terrible double handguard
[0:32:17] <+nesence2> man if they had jsut shot him instead of doing a protagainst throw...
[0:32:39] <cap_bon> are droids sentient because the life of some of droids seems hellish
[0:32:44] <Eirykr> so when does the game stop being on rails
[0:32:49] <ralphwiggum16> Oh you mean those guys who can kill like thirty of us in two seconds? No problem!
[0:32:50] <piggypig> "can anyone hit him?!" thats a good ass line
[0:32:51] <President_valentine> that's kind of sad
[0:32:57] <Triblade1992> they could have had the protag jump off instead of throwing him that way
[0:33:16] <ThatGuyThere03> GO GET E,
[0:33:26] <The_Swedish_X> How many yuris can we fit in this section?
[0:33:33] <+C24U> Jason
[0:33:34] <SuperVaderMan> these guys are just trying their best
[0:33:36] <President_valentine> a slasher villain
[0:33:38] <ziggyjesus> I do like how they all comment during the fight. Even with the comments when they''re being killed
[0:33:46] <Triblade1992> What is "that scene from Rogue One where Vader slowly walks to the rebels"
[0:33:48] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> PLOT
[0:33:49] <SuperVaderMan> I think it was an accident
[0:33:53] <+ShadowSaif> He didn't sound like the brightest guy
[0:33:54] <+C24U> Light Sabers Hurt
[0:33:59] <ReNhoSoft1> dont question it, just enjoy the ride
[0:34:00] <KellBeII> that reminded me of rogue one where vader slowly walks into the hallway killing everyone
[0:34:01] <ahegotrigger> its not like jedi are known for shields or force jumps or anything
[0:34:01] <deadstrat> He is a secret DOUBLE AGENT
[0:34:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Am i the only one that think force uses should just make an force shield bubble around them, instead of doing a locomia dance with their laser swords?
[0:34:08] <ralphwiggum16> Vader, it's like really unfair
[0:34:10] <AnacondaVirtue> Giant, bottomless pits are the least lethal things in Star Wars, as Maul's survival and the TRoS trailer have taught us.
[0:34:15] <@dcn2049> T-pose for dominance?
[0:34:16] <The_Swedish_X> he was well dressed and could do the force, so he was at least a boss fight later.
[0:34:17] <ReNhoSoft1> imagine how much damage he could do using a blaster, perfect aim using the force
[0:34:18] <Lkprime> she got surprised from you igniting your lightsaber. she did it on accident. I think
[0:34:21] <ziggyjesus> Balancing on a slippery pole on a highspeed train
[0:34:24] <+nesence2> man that windspeed does not match the velocity of the train
[0:34:25] <ahegotrigger> the real jedi was the guy who threw you into a new area
[0:34:41] <Triblade1992> "game end yourself Jedi" - signed, the Emperor
[0:34:46] <SuperVaderMan> that's not a stormtrooper though
[0:34:54] <Eirykr> the force does whatever makes stuff look cooler, it's not really supposed to be consistent
[0:35:03] <ralphwiggum16> these poor stormtroopers
[0:35:15] <President_valentine> that's so mean
[0:35:18] <LordPubious> the lighting on the sabre is cool
[0:35:27] <KellBeII> i always feel bad for the troopers
[0:35:27] <ziggyjesus> Unfortunately no dismemberment in this game
[0:35:30] <ralphwiggum16> their dialogues lend them an air shakespearian tragedy
[0:35:30] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a Jedi using the force to deflect any shot with a blaster might as well be a platoon killer. Just picturing the terminator 2
[0:35:38] <KellBeII> theyre just jims and joes doing their jobs
[0:35:40] <+whiskey_wolfe_> There IS dismemberment, just on non-human enemies.
[0:35:48] <ziggyjesus> I think Force Unleashed had dismemberment on humans
[0:35:49] <cap_bon> run that guy through as he begs for help
[0:35:55] <Triblade1992> I was about to say "They are clones" but I'm not so sure...
[0:36:00] <Eirykr> they need to put Kylo Ren's freeze-a-blaster-bolt-in-air power
[0:36:01] <ralphwiggum16> Stop hurting them!!
[0:36:23] <AnacondaVirtue> I hate to sound like some kind of gore-loving simpleton, but the fact you actually don't dismember people really makes the saber feel limp to me.
[0:36:28] <@dcn2049> not as much dismembermeber as there should be
[0:36:30] <ReNhoSoft1> i still dont understand why he doesnt pick up a blaster, its not like carrying one is gonna hurt
[0:36:50] <Triblade1992> Because they are uncivilized @ReNhoSoft1
[0:36:50] <Eirykr> wiffle-ball bat lightsabers are very flaccid feeling, they should dismember
[0:36:50] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> @AnacondaVirtue Seconded
[0:36:51] <@dcn2049> Do you ever get to slice and dice?
[0:37:08] <ziggyjesus> Feels like a baseball bat instead of a lightsaber, especially since you can't cut random objects in the environment
[0:37:09] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Only on non-humans, but seeing as it's in game someone will mod it sooner or later.
[0:37:10] <ReNhoSoft1> Thats the most infuriating line in that whole trilogy >:(
[0:37:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> They probably didn't do the dismemberment on humans thingie cause pussy as pg reasons. Or maybe they focused more on the graphics then gameplay features
[0:37:32] <@dcn2049> weak
[0:37:38] <ziggyjesus> I wish more games had Revengence's "cut everything" tech
[0:37:57] <+Spiggerus> Your kitty drawing is nice
[0:38:01] <ralphwiggum16> I think its best if we don't treat the stormtroopers like they're human
[0:38:08] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Disney fired James Gunn for making rape jokes. They're not gonna let you dismember people.
[0:38:17] <@dcn2049> Disney can go to hell
[0:38:30] <ziggyjesus> Cal is actually pretty fragile
[0:38:32] <ralphwiggum16> it makes it easier when they die
[0:38:37] <Eirykr> So this is just dumbed down Force Unleashed then
[0:38:38] <deadstrat> so is this arkham combat or what?
[0:38:44] <Triblade1992> @whiskey_wolfe_ They allowed a cartoon to cut up people, why not let people do that
[0:38:53] <piggypig> the stormtrooper dialogue is pretty funny
[0:38:59] <ziggyjesus> Seems like "souls inspired" combat
[0:39:02] <+whiskey_wolfe_> @Triblade1992 When?
[0:39:09] <Triblade1992> @whiskey_wolfe_ Rebels
[0:39:09] <President_valentine> guess that's what the slow is for
[0:39:19] <KellBeII> looks like assassins creed combat
[0:39:32] <ralphwiggum16> Didn't Disney make a cartoon where Mickey Mouse fucks a cantalope?
[0:39:32] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Oh, that's just pictures :)
[0:39:33] <KellBeII> where its more about waiting for the enemy to swing first
[0:39:36] <cap_bon> not everyone can cut people apart like Rei
[0:39:48] <ReNhoSoft1> Its inbetween ass creed and sekiro
[0:39:57] <+brave_sj> I like that any contact with the lightsaber seems to damage enemies
[0:40:41] <ziggyjesus> Nice sprint animation
[0:40:44] <+Thechessdragon> gronks
[0:40:45] <The_Swedish_X> Cal, are you okay? You appear to be talking to no one or yourself.
[0:40:50] <ralphwiggum16> so it's like a less fun Shadows of the Empire
[0:40:51] <+nesence2> good thing that that thing can't meve to another angle
[0:40:51] <Morsuzado> Good evening Uncle Plague
[0:40:54] <ziggyjesus> Just BOOK IT
[0:41:00] <+whiskey_wolfe_> I like that a gunship's lasers can't shoot through cargo freight.
[0:41:50] <ziggyjesus> Game might be fun, looks like a purchase when a complete edition comes out for like $30
[0:41:50] <+Thechessdragon> feels like uncharted
[0:41:50] <Triblade1992> Maybe they are set to stun for the Inquistors to kill?
[0:41:54] <@dcn2049> he talks a lot, doesn't he
[0:42:01] <cap_bon> man this is a huge ass train carrying nothing
[0:42:12] <Eirykr> carrying scrap, gotta have scrap
[0:42:24] <Lkprime> this feels like space Uncharted
[0:42:24] <ReNhoSoft1> whatcah guys prefer, games closer to force unleashed or Kotor?
[0:42:26] <+commanderclaw> This is very Fast & The Furious
[0:42:30] <Eirykr> train made from scrap, carrying scrap
[0:42:32] <Triblade1992> Yeah, this is just uncharted
[0:42:39] <ziggyjesus> If Cal Jumped on the climbing section outside, wouldn;t be fly backwards?
[0:42:40] <@dcn2049> that is an ugly ship
[0:42:45] <stranger59> Is it Starkiller?
[0:42:46] <ThatGuyThere03> HOW ARE THEY TALKING TO EACH OTHER?
[0:42:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's the Black Lady from First Contact!
[0:42:51] <piggypig> ball sack man is dead plague
[0:42:56] <ziggyjesus> So you should trust her
[0:42:57] <deadstrat> HAHA
[0:43:00] <+commanderclaw> Vagina face woman was the only woman I ever trusted!
[0:43:02] <President_valentine> haha
[0:43:02] <Triblade1992> HAHAHAH
[0:43:05] <AnacondaVirtue> He looks at his hand as he fell
[0:43:05] <+nesence2> oh so that jump isn'tt makeable but all the otehrs ones this guy can jsut ace
[0:43:09] <+Thechessdragon> So much death for him to fall off a train
[0:43:10] <+brave_sj> IT'S ME, STANDARD BRITISH REBEL WOMAN CLASS 3
[0:43:16] <ziggyjesus> It's black lady from Wolfenstein 2
[0:43:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> ReNhoSoft1 i wish we had a Kotor game with same level of carnage and combat as Force Unleashed. Where you play as a grey jedi that tell the Jedi and Sith to suck his nuts and lick his dick
[0:44:12] <Triblade1992> I find it weird that the Stormtroopers have those electrical shocky sticks that were clearly invented in the Sequel era
[0:44:20] <@dcn2049> I like that you deflected shots back without really doing anything other than spaz around
[0:44:24] <SuperVaderMan> I love the idea of a stormtrooper just running up and sucker punching a jedi with a stun baton like that
[0:44:27] <KellBeII> so whyre scout troopers here?
[0:44:27] <ReNhoSoft1> i have yet to play that gives you that level of freedom of movement/combat while still keeping a ohesive story
[0:44:41] <+Thechessdragon> I miss Kyle Katarn
[0:44:44] <ziggyjesus> Ballsack guy ate it way too early for me to care
[0:44:53] <stranger59> When does Dash Rendar show up?
[0:45:05] <ralphwiggum16> your mom misses Kyle Katarn
[0:45:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i like the scout trooper's helmet so much better the the Storm Troopers
[0:45:12] <+Thechessdragon> I bet she does
[0:45:18] <SuperVaderMan> wow this train stopped fast
[0:45:18] <ziggyjesus> I think the devs were going for a "Sarah dies in Joels arms" thing in The Last of Us
[0:45:22] <ReNhoSoft1> I rather get another Kotor than another unleashed, but that ain happening no more :(
[0:45:23] <Lkprime> EVERYONE'S mom misses Kyle Katarn
[0:45:47] <+whiskey_wolfe_> His death just established that The Empire is a threat.
[0:45:51] <Triblade1992> I miss Mara Jade because she was what Timothy Zahn wanted for a female Star Wars character. Zahn criticized all the females characters in the OT back in the day
[0:46:03] <ralphwiggum16> This game is made for 8 year olds plague
[0:46:09] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Prauf should have lived for another hour to make the player care a smidge
[0:46:10] <The_Swedish_X> We doing this again? Already?
[0:46:19] <President_valentine> more uncharted
[0:46:32] <ThatGuyThere03> DEAD
[0:46:35] <SuperVaderMan> instantly dead from the impact LUL
[0:46:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ReNhoSoft1 Well considering how EA responded to Viseral when they wanted to make an Star Wars rpg that was single player...yeah i guess we will never gat anything close to an Star Wars RPG
[0:46:40] <Triblade1992> much more uncharted
[0:46:41] <+Thechessdragon> Uncharted but Starwars\
[0:46:43] <stranger59> Imagine if he went through all of that and did just die in the end.
[0:46:45] <+Thechessdragon> Wait is this 1313
[0:46:56] <ralphwiggum16> man all this falling is making me so excited
[0:46:56] <The_Swedish_X> Nah, he had a force field on when falling, so he didn't take damage.
[0:47:00] <deadstrat> Already?
[0:47:08] <+whiskey_wolfe_> I HOPE you will be voting for BREXIT, young Padawan!
[0:47:10] <ThatGuyThere03> that
[0:47:15] <@dcn2049> That looked pathetic
[0:47:16] <ThatGuyThere03> that's not even any sort of form
[0:47:17] <Triblade1992> WOMAN, YOU WERE ONCE A JEDI
[0:47:22] <The_Swedish_X> Like anyone uses any real stances anymore.
[0:47:25] <Triblade1992> ALL THE INQUISTORS WERE ONCE JEDI
[0:47:44] <AnacondaVirtue> When they glow red, Plague
[0:47:48] <ziggyjesus> She glows RED
[0:47:50] <+C24U> Red Heighligts
[0:47:52] <@dcn2049> RED attacks are UNBLOCKABLE
[0:47:54] <deadstrat> Looks like
[0:47:56] <+brave_sj> "Red attacks are unblockable"
[0:48:00] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> DODGE
[0:48:06] <stranger59> Use the Force... to roll!
[0:48:07] <ReNhoSoft1> Its sekiro, but close enough
[0:48:11] <Geoddox> plague confirmed colorblind
[0:48:12] <@dcn2049> gross
[0:48:13] <AnacondaVirtue> @PlagueOfGripes Only unblockables. Otherwise you still have to maintain contact if you actually want to hit them
[0:48:16] <ralphwiggum16> plague turns into DSP/Arin
[0:48:19] <The_Swedish_X> When the enemy that has a red lighting weapon glows red-er, that's when it is unblockable.
[0:48:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Do you think that when the second sister gets layd, do her lovers always say "keep the helmet on...it's hotter"?
[0:48:23] <Triblade1992> Well it's because Dark Souls taught it and it became too ingrained in the DNA
[0:48:24] <+Thechessdragon> So is he a DEX build?
[0:48:29] <Geoddox> LP blindness is real
[0:48:30] <+Punishedkaiger> That looked generous enough to be able to sidestrafe
[0:48:45] <%Rezca> so how many i-frames on dodge?
[0:48:51] <ziggyjesus> I don't like how the dodge puts you so far from the enemy, preventing you from continuing a combo.
[0:49:02] <cap_bon> Who has better I-frames Jedi or sith?
[0:49:13] <Triblade1992> I think the sith does
[0:49:33] <+Thechessdragon> why do lasers explode?
[0:49:34] <ThatGuyThere03> aw come one you were winning
[0:49:34] <The_Swedish_X> I assume jedi because they evade while sith should tank like an anime villain.
[0:49:36] <ziggyjesus> There should be a side-step with limited iframes so you can't phase through enemy's attacks and requires more thought
[0:49:47] <stranger59> Inquisitors are paid by the hour, she's in no rush.
[0:49:53] <+nesence2> she should use her lightsaber to fly since thats a thing
[0:49:56] <+whiskey_wolfe_> That whole Rule of Two thing should really fuck this lady over, shouldn't it?
[0:50:06] <Triblade1992> They actually all are ex jedi
[0:50:09] <Triblade1992> this was confirmed
[0:50:10] <deadstrat> this is dumb
[0:50:17] <@dcn2049> that seems really really stupid
[0:50:23] <SuperVaderMan> Well guess she fell to her death
[0:50:28] <@dcn2049> and I still think that ship is ugly
[0:50:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> So Inquisitor are just Dark Jedi?
[0:50:31] <stranger59> Show her helicopter blading!
[0:50:33] <President_valentine> turn your lightsaber off asshole
[0:50:36] <ziggyjesus> Yeah, her jumping on the ship is dumb
[0:50:36] <The_Swedish_X> Why was his lightsaber on for that long?
[0:50:38] <KellBeII> prolly shouldnt have the light saber out while the ship is flailing about
[0:50:38] <+whiskey_wolfe_> It's Pat's Dad
[0:50:47] <MKUltima> Why is the jedi tom Holland
[0:50:49] <Eirykr> The Rule of Two doesn't apply to Inquisitors apparently because Palpatine is training them wrong on purpose
[0:50:51] <Lkprime> he's a testiculon
[0:50:55] <+whiskey_wolfe_> and Black Lady from First Contact.
[0:50:55] <ziggyjesus> More like Deez Nuts
[0:51:04] <+brave_sj> Why didn't she just cut a hole in the cockpit to stop it from leaving the atmosphere
[0:51:05] <ThatGuyThere03> HOW WOULD HE NOT KNOW?
[0:51:14] <Triblade1992> Basically yes @morcego_cinzento_arts which means if Jorus C'Boath were to be rebooted back, they can just get rid of the Clone of a Jedi thing and connect him to the Inquistors
[0:51:15] <Sol_Cataphract> her eyes are popping out of her skull so far
[0:51:21] <@dcn2049> Something is wrong with all their faces
[0:51:27] <ahegotrigger> maybe its destroying in a sexual manner
[0:51:38] <TheAsylumCat> I hate this Main character just by looking at him
[0:51:41] <The_Swedish_X> Destroy with mind fuckery force powers could mean a lot
[0:51:49] <@dcn2049> Cal's a mouth breather
[0:51:51] <%Rezca> alien hybrid?
[0:51:54] <deadstrat> Glad you explain my character to me
[0:51:58] <SuperVaderMan> It doesn't help that they have larger-than-normal eyes for humans
[0:51:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is it just me or does she looks a bit like a female Chris Tucker?
[0:52:05] <ReNhoSoft1> our protagonist shouldve died 5 times already, off to a good start
[0:52:19] <Triblade1992> Except for Obi Wan and Yoda. but we don't mention those guys
[0:52:21] <+Punishedkaiger> The jedi order would be all of like 5 people left alive
[0:52:24] <@dcn2049> his hair is super plastic
[0:52:31] <+Punishedkaiger> Two of them wouldn't join even at gunpoint
[0:52:37] <@dcn2049> hahaha
[0:52:49] <SivSarcast> Oh boy, both Plague and Pat are streaming. Where do I goooo?
[0:52:50] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Ugh, so tired of writers trying to pg-ify things by using words like "destroy" or "obliterate" when we all know somebody means KILL
[0:53:04] <cap_bon> is there paper bag DLC for all the human chaarcters
[0:53:07] <AnacondaVirtue> He looks so much better without the poncho
[0:53:14] <@dcn2049> what the fuck
[0:53:15] <ReNhoSoft1> Or murder, or assassinate. So many beautiful words
[0:53:20] <MarkSoupial> lego star wars looking good
[0:53:20] <Eirykr> Remember when Star Wars wasn't just for kiddos?
[0:53:21] <Triblade1992> the hair looks off
[0:53:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Triblade1992 Is that from the CG clone war series?
[0:53:24] <+Punishedkaiger> Yeah! Look at the weird lighting
[0:53:25] <The_Swedish_X> What's wrong with his hair back there?
[0:53:32] <Lkprime> I think the ballsack guy looks even weirder because of the mutton chops
[0:53:38] <cap_bon> his hair is plastic
[0:53:46] <ziggyjesus> The lady is portrayed by Debra Wilson, who also has "buggy eyes"
[0:53:48] <stranger59> Space cow tools
[0:53:49] <ReNhoSoft1> So... when does this game take place?
[0:53:55] <The_Swedish_X> probably tastes amazing
[0:53:55] <+brave_sj> That looks like Garfield
[0:53:56] <Burningskull01> better hair than dragon age tho
[0:53:57] <@dcn2049> eat it
[0:53:58] <AnacondaVirtue> Even if the Ebon Hawk is just a Falcon knock of. It's probably the BEST Falcon knockoff. Just different enough to sort of be it's own thing
[0:54:03] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Cal reminds me of Schwarzenegger
[0:54:03] <+nesence2> its beans
[0:54:07] <Lkprime> 5 years after revenge of the sith I think
[0:54:12] <Triblade1992> @morcego_cinzento_arts Jorus C'Boath is from the Thrawn Trilogy books back in 1991-1993. In order to get around the whole "last of the Jedi" thing, Zahn wrote up C'boath was a clone of a Jedi
[0:54:12] <Devsteps> Good ol brain ham
[0:54:15] <ziggyjesus> @ReNhoSoft1 5 years after revenge
[0:54:18] <+Thechessdragon> Play Jizz
[0:54:46] <ReNhoSoft1> oh, i thought this was gonna be its own thing. Thats kinda depressing
[0:54:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Triblade1992 I see. Interesting
[0:55:07] <SivSarcast> That's a weird-looking shawzin.
[0:55:09] <@dcn2049> the ship has a giant blind spot directly above it
[0:55:15] <stranger59> Sing the song of your people
[0:55:15] <+brave_sj> Play Freebird
[0:55:25] <Reook1> Space Banjo?
[0:55:25] <+ghostmutton> Anyway, here's Wonderwall
[0:55:28] <ziggyjesus> Anyways... here's Wonderwall
[0:55:28] <Triblade1992> @morcego_cinzento_arts That's why a reboot of Thrawn trilogy can get rid of the clone part and just have him be connected to the Inquistors as an ex jedi
[0:55:30] <@dcn2049> fuuuuuuuuuuuck this
[0:55:31] <piggypig> play "im han solo"
[0:55:37] <TheAsylumCat> dont fucking sing
[0:55:43] <MarkSoupial> I wrote those 17 notes
[0:55:51] <SivSarcast> @piggypig no, anything but that.
[0:55:53] <cap_bon> stop zooming in on his face game
[0:56:00] <The_Swedish_X> "you're so special, main character"
[0:56:05] <%MarkSoupial> MarkSoupial subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:56:14] <stranger59> Remember that Jefferson Starship is canon.
[0:56:19] <ThatGuyThere03> >not being impartial in political matters
[0:56:27] <ThatGuyThere03> sounds like a shit jedi tbh
[0:56:37] <Triblade1992> Jedi with PTSD?
[0:56:39] <stranger59> Samus, you lost all your gear?
[0:56:41] <%MarkSoupial> ow, my medichlorians
[0:56:42] <Lkprime> that space PTSD tho
[0:56:43] <TheAsylumCat> special oc looks like someone's douche ginger son
[0:56:44] <ReNhoSoft1> "Im sorry, im suffering samus aran syndrome"
[0:56:45] <@dcn2049> okay samus
[0:56:49] <MKUltima> Tap into the Dark Side for a quick level
[0:56:50] <AnacondaVirtue> I'm fine with the Force being a video game thing when the media in question is an actual video game
[0:56:59] <The_Swedish_X> "I can also maybe turn evil somewhere down the line"
[0:57:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "You see. Jedi are also naturally virtuosos musicians by the power of the force. The force makes you got at anything basically...only thing it doesn't allow you to do is not to become either an space religious nut virgin or a genocidal maniac"
[0:57:09] <@dcn2049> god I hate this shiip
[0:57:14] <Triblade1992> Basically Dragon Quest 11 and the Yydrissil roots
[0:57:17] <Laecerelius> It's the echo during Stormblood!
[0:57:18] <Triblade1992> got it
[0:57:22] <stranger59> The Force does that a lot.
[0:57:26] <Lkprime> Force Exposition
[0:57:34] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> "Done hiding" LUL
[0:57:35] <%MarkSoupial> the WILL of the force
[0:57:48] <+Punishedkaiger> Completely unknown planets don't have a track record of staying unknown
[0:57:59] <Triblade1992> Yeah her eyes are just WUUUUH?
[0:58:05] <@dcn2049> That's creepy
[0:58:11] <+ghostmutton> "Help me my eyes are trying to escape my skull"
[0:58:12] <ReNhoSoft1> You renounce the force at the cost of becoming ugly, of course
[0:58:13] <%MarkSoupial> Disney Eyes:tm:
[0:58:17] <+brave_sj> At least his eyes stay in his head where they belong
[0:58:19] <piggypig> its the force song, did you hear it guys? lets clap
[0:58:20] <AnacondaVirtue> I mean that's basically what Luke did for a while. Till they twisted his arm
[0:58:23] <+C24U> I cant use Jedi powers either
[0:58:23] <MKUltima> Sounds like a Holocron
[0:58:29] <@dcn2049> It takes all her force powers to keep here eyes in their sockets
[0:58:30] <ahegotrigger> she probably had sex once and can no longer be a Jedi
[0:58:38] <ziggyjesus> Respawn did make a really good Titanfall 2 campaign, I was hoping this game's campaign would be great too.
[0:58:38] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> This game looks pretty when you don't see a face.
[0:58:42] <CaptainSkelly> Can they nerf her eyes please
[0:58:43] <KellBeII> dacon im dying
[0:58:43] <The_Swedish_X> maybe she blocked it off because... it would help her survive?
[0:58:47] <KellBeII> thats too good
[0:58:49] <stranger59> Turns out the Force never existed.
[0:58:50] <+ghostmutton> I miss when we were scrappers
[0:58:54] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> How does one just "stop" being a Jedi? I bet the plot revolves around some Sith stealing/obstructing the connection to the Force.
[0:59:01] <madcatr> you have to find Mickey mouse from Fantasia and he'll restore the order
[0:59:08] <rockywm> How much Uncharted bullshit is in this?
[0:59:11] <ziggyjesus> Why would ANYONE cut themself off of the force?
[0:59:15] <+C24U> Bon Fire
[0:59:15] <Triblade1992> Customization?
[0:59:29] <ReNhoSoft1> @Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn Thats the plot to regvenge of the sith Kappa
[0:59:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> The only way to have sex and still be able to use the force is if you die all your robes black, get a red light saber, use thicc shoulder pads and do occasional genocidal thingies
[0:59:33] <eldragon_1> Not yet I think
[0:59:36] <%MarkSoupial> so who repaints the ship every time you change this?
[0:59:43] <KellBeII> "hey guys i just met i painted your ship!"
[0:59:51] <AnacondaVirtue> Look at that giant ass lizard in the back
[0:59:52] <stranger59> Bother that dinosaur
[0:59:55] <The_Swedish_X> They'll probably tutorial you about it later.
[1:00:02] <KellBeII> pet it!
[1:00:06] <@dcn2049> Kill them
[1:00:08] <ziggyjesus> I hate it when customization options are locked behind paying for it. Let me earn it in game through currency or achievements
[1:00:09] <Lkprime> you gotta get to a force bonfire first
[1:00:10] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> @ReNhoSoft1 LUL Shot in the dark, never seen any of the movies
[1:00:12] <The_Swedish_X> I recognize this track.
[1:00:12] <%MarkSoupial> klaigePorg
[1:00:13] <Triblade1992> They always have them with Ewoks, Porgs, etc
[1:00:16] <@dcn2049> Jump
[1:00:18] <@dcn2049> Yessss
[1:00:21] <Sol_Cataphract> oh..
[1:00:32] <stranger59> Were those loth cats?
[1:00:39] <AnacondaVirtue> It's a Metroidvania, apparently
[1:00:40] <+Thechessdragon> I had to walk away is this Walt Disney's Tomb?
[1:00:47] <%MarkSoupial> LESS?
[1:00:49] <Triblade1992> I perfer linear over the giant open world stuff
[1:00:49] <ziggyjesus> Don't speak too soon, Plague
[1:00:53] <%MarkSoupial> which franchise is this?
[1:01:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Star Wars just love their buggy eyed creatures, be it cute critters, weird alien monster and even the humans. Honestly the bug eyed humans are more terrifing
[1:01:04] <Triblade1992> Open world got to obsessive back in the previous gen
[1:01:10] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical bonefire
[1:01:23] <stranger59> Store bought meditation point... everything is so commercial now.
[1:01:25] <piggypig> bon force
[1:01:27] <+C24U> Sphere Grid
[1:01:29] <Triblade1992> Sphere Grid from FF10 is back
[1:01:33] <The_Swedish_X> can't escape from 10
[1:01:37] <Lkprime> bonfire Chan cannot be confined to one franchise
[1:01:42] <stranger59> Decapitate!
[1:01:49] <cap_bon> skill maze
[1:01:54] <%MarkSoupial> Jedi of Mordor
[1:01:56] <ReNhoSoft1> congrats, youve unlocked a heavy attack
[1:02:03] <The_Swedish_X> So you can dismember helpless animals but not fellow humanoids?
[1:02:09] <ReNhoSoft1> Your connection to the force is so damaged you forgot how to use your muscles, figures
[1:02:40] <Triblade1992> I just wish that they combined the crystarium from FF13 with FF10 sphere grid to give some form of sense of progression
[1:02:40] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> He decapitated that worm-thing with a bisecting slash. GG makes sense
[1:02:52] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh at least we got a nun humanoid alien creature decaptated. At least i can retract my argument about pretty graphics with boring gameplay. But i can keep the pg bullshit one
[1:03:14] <TheAsylumCat> @renhosoft1 I like to imagine that he spent a year of shitting his pants after that happened
[1:03:17] <cap_bon> Which one make number big
[1:03:29] <%MarkSoupial> how come rey didnt do this for han solo?
[1:03:36] <@dcn2049> oh dammit
[1:03:36] <ReNhoSoft1> Maybe he always did that and just used the force to clean up
[1:03:39] <ReNhoSoft1> No wait, wrong franchise
[1:03:43] <Triblade1992> I think they get rid of that in Grand Master though
[1:03:43] <The_Swedish_X> Elements of the ds1 bonfire and all the maidens.
[1:03:45] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Oh, look, it's the Duckling Droid
[1:03:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh god, Star Wars Wall-E now?
[1:03:49] <piggypig> so how do people understand droids
[1:03:56] <+whiskey_wolfe_> God he's got such a punchable face.
[1:04:05] <The_Swedish_X> This feels very familiar a scene.
[1:04:10] <townzzzzz> mini-at-st
[1:04:14] <+brave_sj> I've seen this before, the wacky whimsical droid is the jedi
[1:04:15] <Triblade1992> "jump" - Plague of Grips
[1:04:21] <%MarkSoupial> is the droid button R2? mphDerp
[1:05:09] <Triblade1992> and then some need a universal translator droid
[1:05:12] <stranger59> Star Wars operates on Tekken rules.
[1:05:13] <%MarkSoupial> except wookie
[1:05:16] <AnacondaVirtue> Look at this Metroid Prime-ass map
[1:05:39] <Triblade1992> good, we don't need that
[1:05:39] <The_Swedish_X> It's like they want to do the Tekkan thing of everyone speaks their language and just understands everyone elses.
[1:06:06] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> I bet everyone has a translator chip thingamajig implanted in them to understand all language. The audience sure doesn't get that benefit, though.
[1:06:06] <%MarkSoupial> io still don't know why everyone knows Huttese
[1:06:27] <ReNhoSoft1> Its kinda forgivable, star wards is just a magic adventure set in space
[1:06:52] <ReNhoSoft1> the less you think about it, the more you enjoy it
[1:07:03] <+brave_sj> @MarkSoupial Everyone doesn't, that's why Jabba took C-3PO
[1:07:04] <ziggyjesus> BTW Plague, how is performance? The game apparently runs awful on the Xbox One S
[1:07:33] <The_Swedish_X> Huttese feels like one of the only languages few people speak
[1:07:44] <Triblade1992> Stop game ending the pretty boy!
[1:07:45] <AnacondaVirtue> I bet you get a double jump at some point
[1:07:51] <+vandesdelca0> wall run is an ability you get eventually
[1:07:54] <%MarkSoupial> you need to be a level 3 jedi to force double jump probably
[1:08:00] <ziggyjesus> This isn't Titanfall 2, you can't wallrun on every surface
[1:08:10] <stranger59> Beep boop beep!
[1:08:20] <ReNhoSoft1> everygame is better by having wallrun tho
[1:08:32] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> The backseating droid.
[1:08:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I guess that Jedi cannot use their telekinesis to levitate themselves whe they fall off the edge
[1:08:35] <AnacondaVirtue> Hold it, pPlague
[1:08:47] <%MarkSoupial> oh lord
[1:08:50] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Oggdo Bogdo
[1:08:50] <@dcn2049> Come oooon
[1:08:53] <ziggyjesus> miniboss encountered
[1:08:54] <piggypig> frog
[1:08:54] <Triblade1992> I still prefer that over "GIANT OPEN WORLD LOL RUN ANYWHERE" stuff. Open world became an obsession
[1:09:05] <@dcn2049> Do it
[1:09:17] <KellBeII> oggdo bogdo
[1:09:38] <@dcn2049> derpy
[1:09:40] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> It is a froggo dodongo
[1:09:59] <AnacondaVirtue> You don't have to dodge everything. Sidestepping lets you stay close enough to still counterattack. It's not DS3
[1:09:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Now we know why EA said that single player no longer eppals anymore. When they are now only capable of making boring single player
[1:10:06] <piggypig> recover your midichlorians plague
[1:10:14] <poweruser> easy mode unlocked
[1:10:17] <ziggyjesus> So just reach the enemy instead of killing the enemy like in Bloodborne
[1:10:47] <piggypig> in bloodborne you had to kill the enemy that ate your bloodsouls
[1:10:47] <%MarkSoupial> no one's ever really gone
[1:11:27] <Triblade1992> Coming back to that whole "open world thing" that game design became a huge pain in the butt which basically destroyed bethesda's credibility.
[1:11:47] <Laecerelius> At least you only have to hit it and you don't have to kill it
[1:11:48] <Triblade1992> "we are going to need 16 times the detail and 4 times the size of Fallout 4"
[1:11:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:12:02] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah but what if I just decided to say "fuck the souls"
[1:12:07] <Lkprime> in this, all you have to do is hit the enemy once and you get your stuff back
[1:12:44] <piggypig> yee
[1:12:46] <ziggyjesus> Man, he just attacks nonstop
[1:12:54] <piggypig> hes an angry frog
[1:13:05] <ziggyjesus> Some stagger would be nice, instead he rotates on a disk and bites
[1:13:08] <%MarkSoupial> blaster master frog level 99
[1:13:24] <Triblade1992> thankfully this seems like an optional boss
[1:13:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Triblade1992 i thought what destroyed Bethesda's credibility was their greed, lazyness and compousive need to lie
[1:13:33] <%MarkSoupial> DansGame
[1:13:41] <%MarkSoupial> you have a laser sword
[1:13:51] <+FunkyRot> walk into the blades and gt sliced in half like a funny cartoon
[1:13:53] <%MarkSoupial> physical objects should be no impediment
[1:14:03] <ziggyjesus> This looks like the "progress path"
[1:14:04] <Triblade1992> @morcego_cinzento_arts it was their need to be bigger and more exploring. Why do you think people perfer New Vegas over Fallout 3 and 4?
[1:14:36] <Triblade1992> Or outer worlds over the fallout Bethesda games?
[1:14:56] <AnacondaVirtue> I think you just slow them down to make a path
[1:14:59] <+vandesdelca0> it's water
[1:15:23] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Triblade1992 Well i like New Vegas way better cause i can see it had much more brain behind it and the side quests were more fun along many other rpg mechanics. Does that count?
[1:15:58] <ziggyjesus> I'm pretty sure there was a glowing blue orb in that miniboss's room
[1:16:01] <PipingHotBeepis> Outer Worlds ain't a Fallout type RPG, and NV has a worse worldspace than 3 by far
[1:16:04] <piggypig> it binds and penetrates us and all that
[1:16:13] <Jrockoni> jedi nerds getting hyped over a spinning ball. For some reason that's funny as hell to me
[1:16:21] <Triblade1992> New Vegas was more focused on what content was in the game rather than just making it bigger and giving more options.
[1:16:23] <PipingHotBeepis> That's got to do with different strengths than anything
[1:16:28] <ziggyjesus> Fallout 3 has metros
[1:16:48] <ziggyjesus> linear shooting gallerys in a game with awful gunplay
[1:17:03] <xeros720> he needed those legs
[1:17:09] <Torivore> Looked like
[1:17:43] <PipingHotBeepis> New Vegas has two expanses of open land with no content, the worst map design to travel with, and a linear path built around discouraging exploration early on to new players
[1:17:59] <PipingHotBeepis> It's better to say it played to RPG strengths than map strengths which is why people tend to like it more
[1:18:30] <+brave_sj> Yes
[1:18:33] <%MarkSoupial> wait so
[1:18:40] <%MarkSoupial> is it using more power?
[1:18:40] <+xanochoy> @PlagueOfGripes can you block his attacks?
[1:18:46] <ziggyjesus> Like the torch in dark Souls 3
[1:18:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Fallout 3 has mercenaries and regulators that hunt you down based on being able to magically tell that you are either a good or bad person....was i supposed to pick a positive for Fallout 3? I guess that the possitives is that in the ps3 it ran better then NV
[1:18:58] <%Rezca> ok, i-frames confirmed
[1:19:15] <+brave_sj> You're using the force to make it glow brighter, I thought we agreed to not ask questions while we were consuming product
[1:19:24] <Triblade1992> I think you have to use the force to stop him\
[1:19:38] <poweruser> red attacks are unblockable
[1:19:42] <+CursedNobleman> @morcego_cinzento_arts huhhm, did it? they were both pretty bad LUL
[1:19:49] <AnacondaVirtue> I hate to keep saying this. But you only need to dodge the attacks where their bodies glow red. Everything else you can either just sidestep or block/parry
[1:19:56] <Laecerelius> I think you can parry his normal chomps
[1:20:14] <ziggyjesus> Looks like it's just based on spamming force powers and mash attack
[1:20:26] <laserbeaming> It's probably Frostbite?
[1:20:46] <+brave_sj> They have to load in the massive power of the Frog
[1:20:57] <+brave_sj> It takes time
[1:20:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @CursedNobleman oh i'm not denying that them both were super buggy in the ps3. Butt i had worst freezing of frames in NV then with 3 in the PS#. And i hd all the dlcs for each game
[1:21:16] <morcego_cinzento_arts> ps3
[1:21:25] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes Looked it up, they aren't useing frostbite engine this time
[1:21:28] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> Why is Unicronic Arts so hellbent on putting Frostbite in their games?
[1:21:29] <cap_bon> lame it out like cross tekken
[1:21:35] <+whiskey_wolfe_> What, you don't like Ogopogo?
[1:21:41] <+CursedNobleman> @morcego_cinzento_arts you might be right, im probably just biased because i prefer NV anyhow
[1:21:42] <Vennmaruu_Karos_Corwynn> If it is such a shit system
[1:21:45] <%MarkSoupial> where can i buy a toy of Bossdo Frogdo?
[1:21:46] <Triblade1992> It's using Unreal Engine 4
[1:21:57] <+heartbbyy> do u lose anything when u die?
[1:21:57] <ReNhoSoft1> load times are bad?
[1:21:58] <ziggyjesus> Maybe the devs expect you to return to the planet after leveling up
[1:22:37] <%Scarnehu> Scarnehu subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 44 months! 
[1:22:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @CursedNobleman So do i a hundred times. But even though it was the superior rpg, it had more stability issues. But still it's my fave
[1:22:57] <+LeiteroMasta> i got 2 minutes loading screens on the base ps4 in this game
[1:23:09] <+ghostmutton> Can you cheese him by sitting around the entrance?
[1:23:10] <+xanochoy> almost
[1:23:13] <+brave_sj> Oof
[1:23:20] <The_Swedish_X> you got this now, at least.
[1:23:20] <Triblade1992> better than than dodging
[1:23:20] <ziggyjesus> It is do-able
[1:23:33] <+CursedNobleman> @morcego_cinzento_arts one of these days ill get a proper gaming laptop/comp and play it like its supposed to. Bloated with kinky mods LUL
[1:23:53] <Torivore> Can you heal with up on the d pad? Your inventory mentioned something about that
[1:24:00] <cap_bon> its not doing that. Yet.
[1:24:06] <ziggyjesus> Bloodborne levels of loading
[1:24:17] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> Fallen Loadtimes.
[1:24:19] <$atlasbot1> plague are you color blind red means unblockable it told you when you fought the inquisitor
[1:24:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @CursedNobleman Get the Daughters of Aries mod for NV. you can play with a new race of sexy androids
[1:24:28] <ReNhoSoft1> Bad load times kill games for me, this is why I never replayed bloodborne
[1:24:54] <+silvery_cricket> oh look
[1:24:57] <ziggyjesus> Lets hope they patch in better loading times for this game like they did for Bloodborne
[1:24:57] <+silvery_cricket> Great Jagras
[1:24:58] <%MarkSoupial> cant wait for that 8k xbox 4 or whatever for 10 minute load times
[1:25:02] <piggypig> bloodborne's load times got better
[1:25:14] <%MarkSoupial> uhhh
[1:25:16] <Triblade1992> He's t bagging you
[1:25:16] <SuperVaderMan> LUL
[1:25:17] <piggypig> HE GOT HONRY
[1:25:19] <LordPubious> well...
[1:25:21] <+C24U> teabag
[1:25:22] <rockywm> Can't you drop down on the enemy from above? Plunging Attacks and all
[1:25:22] <+silvery_cricket> Did that frog just hump you to death
[1:25:24] <The_Swedish_X> assert dominance.
[1:25:30] <ziggyjesus> Dang that tracking is intense
[1:25:34] <ziggyjesus> A full 180
[1:25:41] <+heartbbyy> i had a shitty pirate copy of mgs3 once on the ps2 and it took like 10 minutes to load every area. still had hundreds of hours on it though
[1:25:46] <ReNhoSoft1> but I thought everyone loved artificial difficulty Kappa
[1:25:56] <+silvery_cricket> its fine the MC doesnt have a soul to lose
[1:25:59] <biomegabear> can you create your character in this?
[1:26:03] <+CursedNobleman> i have a shitty copy of mgs3, its for the 3ds LUL @heartbbyy
[1:26:20] <The_Swedish_X> That was actually dumb.
[1:26:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> This alien frog creature battle is reminding of one of the expansions of the Witcher 3, with the Frog Prince boss fight
[1:26:27] <+silvery_cricket> do you have any projectiles?
[1:26:34] <ReNhoSoft1> Yeah, thats bad design, dunno who set that up
[1:26:46] <Verriand> remember that you're doing something off the critical path in what is still a tutorial
[1:26:53] <piggypig> you cna do it plague
[1:27:00] <+CursedNobleman> have to teach these tutorial challenges who is boss
[1:27:16] <ziggyjesus> @morcego_cinzento_arts The frog prince also had bad hitboxes, especially on his jumping attack
[1:27:20] <biomegabear> now you're playing star wars monster hunter
[1:27:28] <%MarkSoupial> nice
[1:27:28] <Triblade1992> YEET
[1:27:31] <President_valentine> haha
[1:27:31] <+silvery_cricket> yeah beat him with that blunt lightsaber
[1:27:33] <LeBlanc233> nha
[1:27:39] <%MarkSoupial> NOW we're playing dark souls
[1:27:41] <+CursedNobleman> YEAAAH LUL
[1:27:41] <Torivore> Those animators worked hard on those swings so you WILL enjoy every frame of it
[1:27:43] <+heartbbyy> ez
[1:27:45] <Verriand> well snap, there we are
[1:27:46] <AnacondaVirtue> There you go!
[1:27:50] <biomegabear> thats the most monster hunter fighter ever
[1:27:53] <+brave_sj> THE FROG IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE FROG
[1:27:54] <Laecerelius> Nightmare Slain
[1:27:55] <+silvery_cricket> BOGLIN
[1:27:57] <piggypig> once you get parrying down he seems easy
[1:27:59] <ReNhoSoft1> Thats not a bug, thats a suprise feature
[1:27:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ziggyjesus well that sucks. Always wanted to play Witcher 3
[1:27:59] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> You defeated Goodboy Doggo.
[1:27:59] <SuperVaderMan> Murdered that animal like a true Jedi
[1:28:01] <SwagetronPrime> that name...
[1:28:05] <Verriand> enjoy your Heart Piece
[1:28:13] <Triblade1992> Pull an anakin and game end the YOUNGLINGS!
[1:28:16] <+CursedNobleman> Kappa
[1:28:17] <LordPubious> that's his gaming pc
[1:28:19] <AnacondaVirtue> Try hitting that box?
[1:28:21] <piggypig> thats oggdos boom box
[1:28:23] <The_Swedish_X> return to the force
[1:28:28] <+brave_sj> @PlagueOfGripes That box might be a chest, break it
[1:28:47] <ziggyjesus> @morcego_cinzento_arts Witcher 3 is still a good RPG, just issues with that enemy in particular
[1:29:04] <+heartbbyy> man this game is gonna sell so much
[1:29:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ziggyjesus Understood. Good to know
[1:29:19] <+silvery_cricket> Man that frog was strong a light saber that just 10 seconds ago cut through metal, was bouncing off that frog
[1:29:39] <LeBlanc233> Its amazing what EA can do when they're not trying to sneak into your wallet
[1:29:47] <%MarkSoupial> time to find a bonfire ascetic
[1:29:56] <AnacondaVirtue> Huh, weird. It looked super important
[1:30:02] <cap_bon> man this is such a video game area
[1:30:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> That frog was a force users using the force to block the light saber
[1:30:04] <Verriand> It'll come back later
[1:30:05] <+brave_sj> That is weird
[1:30:13] <+ghostmutton> That looks like a level designer accidentally plopped it down in the editor
[1:30:15] <KellBeII> bet you need some kind of special ability to open it
[1:30:17] <ReNhoSoft1> you need the chest tutorial first plague, obviously
[1:30:23] <ReNhoSoft1> itll become active after or something
[1:30:29] <Triblade1992> might be a key item that you interact with later
[1:30:36] <%MarkSoupial> oh god if you need droid to open it...
[1:30:46] <Verriand> @ReNhoSoft1 Not gonna lie, you're actually right about that
[1:30:48] <KellBeII> couldnt you just cut through the dppr?
[1:30:52] <KellBeII> door
[1:31:05] <frownystar> !uptime
[1:31:05] <@Nightbot> 1 hour 31 minutes 17 seconds
[1:31:12] <ReNhoSoft1> I am genous
[1:31:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a better game would allow us to cut down doors with a laser sword that is supposed to cut through steel
[1:31:15] <piggypig> no kell, video gmae
[1:31:15] <%MarkSoupial> establishing dominance
[1:31:17] <TheDastardlyD> Witchity grub
[1:31:24] <The_Swedish_X> must murder
[1:31:38] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Is a woodgrub some Kentucky thing
[1:31:53] <+photas10> how are the controls ?
[1:31:56] <The_Swedish_X> I refuse these digging abilities in this terrain.
[1:31:59] <%MarkSoupial> those things would be super useful, they just dug through like concrete
[1:32:00] <cap_bon> You can cut its body apart that means it has no soul right
[1:32:11] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[1:32:21] <%MarkSoupial> REALLY
[1:32:24] <The_Swedish_X> Those tubes make no sense.
[1:32:27] <SuperVaderMan> Amazing insight
[1:32:35] <Razmooten> need force powers to tell its a storage room
[1:32:46] <ReNhoSoft1> how else are you gonna do that?
[1:32:52] <Torivore> Truly the force has gifted him
[1:32:57] <%MarkSoupial> it's pretty much canon that the force makes people remarkably dull
[1:33:00] <Snirtax> what's plague's opinion so far?
[1:33:02] <+xanochoy> the collectibles in this game remind me of the new tomb raiders
[1:33:15] <+whiskey_wolfe_> oh my god i love him
[1:33:21] <%MarkSoupial> 0% chance this robot survives this game
[1:33:30] <TheDastardlyD> install gun
[1:33:34] <+ghostmutton> Yep don't actually show what he's doing
[1:33:35] <SuperVaderMan> See our character harvests scrap, so therefore he's a tech genius
[1:33:38] <The_Swedish_X> or if it does, it will be after we think it dies
[1:33:41] <Triblade1992> IDK, droids usually suurvive longer than the Jedi
[1:33:47] <ziggyjesus> Respawn with another trying to make another BT like in Titanfall 2
[1:34:00] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical
[1:34:10] <+kujofire990> i dont like his face
[1:34:11] <SuperVaderMan> Premium orange PogChamp
[1:34:14] <xeros720> PREMIUM
[1:34:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Only for me to even accept this small droid would be if it climbed to your shoulder and acted as an predator shoulder plasma cannon
[1:34:36] <+xanochoy> premium cmonBruh
[1:34:36] <rockywm> PREMIUM CONTENT, the classic EA way
[1:34:38] <%MarkSoupial> the LORE
[1:34:44] <Triblade1992> Orange is premium content
[1:35:00] <ziggyjesus> Hopefully only those two are "Premium" content and the rest can be earned in game
[1:35:11] <Verriand> It's like the baddragon website
[1:35:16] <The_Swedish_X> On one hand, I appreciate being able to not worry about stats when i want esthetic, but there are times when parts should do something.
[1:35:25] <Triblade1992> so you don't cut off your own hand
[1:35:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> on i sure do love paying money for cosmetics in a weapon that is just the handle that you cannot even see in detail most of the time
[1:35:31] <Torivore> I like that but at the same time when will you see you lightsaber this close outside of this menu?
[1:35:36] <LeBlanc233> I wonder if this guy fought in the Mygeeto campaign?
[1:35:49] <%MarkSoupial> we OC now
[1:35:49] <piggypig> orange
[1:35:51] <+whiskey_wolfe_> You can legit do that at the Galaxy's Edge park dude.
[1:35:59] <TheDastardlyD> Gamer fuel flavored light saber
[1:36:01] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Like 8 hundo bucks though
[1:36:16] <smile64> can't wait to find out we are darth revan
[1:36:30] <+ghostmutton> Orange crush flavor
[1:36:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i wonder if plague would like that super long dark light saber in the CG clone wars series
[1:36:35] <Verriand> it's about 600, but you spend 5 hours in line, and they have a bar. you'll spend the other 200 easy
[1:36:37] <Razmooten> Hold light saber in front of face in dark, trip, fun times
[1:36:39] <cap_bon> "ill find my own way out" he says as he starts carving into the rock with his lightsaber
[1:36:41] <%MarkSoupial> i hope they're sturdy like the many other vines I already climbed
[1:36:55] <TheDastardlyD> Have you ever seen a climbable vine spot irl
[1:37:17] <+brave_sj> @smile64 We're actually Snoke
[1:37:24] <xeros720> not on the northcoast, admittedly some tree branches do though
[1:37:25] <%MarkSoupial> rip
[1:37:26] <+brave_sj> LUL
[1:37:27] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:37:38] <biomegabear> is this better than bloodborne?
[1:37:41] <%MarkSoupial> wait are you supposed to be dumb?
[1:37:43] <+vandesdelca0> i can't believe they assumed people would to that
[1:37:43] <laserbeaming> no lightsaber throw?
[1:37:50] <SuperVaderMan> It's our estus lad
[1:37:52] <LordPubious> he's gonna bump his head and activate his latent midochlorians
[1:37:56] <Triblade1992> I guess electricity can go through plasma
[1:37:58] <LeBlanc233> that's the stuff
[1:38:04] <TheDastardlyD> It grinds up fetus into a tiny tube
[1:38:08] <%MarkSoupial> DansGame forced stupidity
[1:38:26] <xeros720> need to get that droid spayed
[1:38:42] <AnacondaVirtue> Being a droid must be a horrific nightmare
[1:38:48] <LeBlanc233> otherwise you get robo-rebellions
[1:38:54] <+silvery_cricket> You know in a era of your life when literally every single person in an enemy army wants you dead
[1:38:57] <PipingHotBeepis> Doesn't R2 forget like everything each trilogy change
[1:38:58] <cap_bon> so their sentient?
[1:39:00] <Verriand> Congrats Plague, the power to unbox is yours now. Despite the droid being with you earlier, he peaces out and then comes back to not really open the chest but just... that.
[1:39:00] <%MarkSoupial> oh no
[1:39:02] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:39:03] <%MarkSoupial> oh noooooooo
[1:39:06] <+silvery_cricket> why would you ever trust a droid
[1:39:07] <Triblade1992> Seemed like it was locked though
[1:39:13] <+silvery_cricket> some random droid
[1:39:15] <TheDastardlyD> But it was red so I guess it was locked?
[1:39:56] <+silvery_cricket> I wonder how many years it takes to hold a fan spinning at 1000RPM
[1:40:10] <Triblade1992> Look, it's LUKE'S Lightsaber tip]
[1:40:18] <+kujofire990> thank you
[1:40:23] <TheDastardlyD> He looks like he has chubby baby cheeks
[1:40:27] <+silvery_cricket> garbage
[1:40:34] <+CursedNobleman> water filters! LUL
[1:40:52] <PipingHotBeepis> NG+ time
[1:41:04] <+silvery_cricket> What you find little buddy *scans a dead hooker in a drain* OH WOW
[1:41:14] <Kurudan> guess they trying to show that all humans aren't models or cool looking. trying to be more..... inclusive
[1:41:26] <+silvery_cricket> that building looks like a penis
[1:42:38] <laserbeaming> So.. is there cool lightsaber dismemberment in this game?
[1:42:40] <+silvery_cricket> I like how they chose a hyper realistic run, but if you lean the stick a little bit the character model just shifts on an axis like 20 degrees
[1:42:45] <ziggyjesus> Can you check out the other box?
[1:42:59] <ziggyjesus> Now that you did the opening boxes tutorial
[1:43:10] <The_Swedish_X> So what plot device will we be given that allows us to teleport between key "bonfires"?
[1:43:15] <%MarkSoupial> i became closer with the force by genociding this planet
[1:43:17] <beetbo2> didn't that rat get bisected
[1:43:21] <ziggyjesus> Yes
[1:43:22] <PipingHotBeepis> yes
[1:43:23] <Triblade1992> yes
[1:43:33] <+brave_sj> Maybe you can slow and climb the sphere
[1:43:36] <xeros720> that or the orb
[1:44:09] <+silvery_cricket> that wall looks climable
[1:44:15] <+silvery_cricket> look it has different coloring
[1:45:05] <+silvery_cricket> turn the fans in the water on
[1:45:17] <+silvery_cricket> so it creates a strong wing that pushes you up
[1:45:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "You know i could just levitate myself with the force...but i'm getting kinda chubb. So i'm just gonna jump on those pipes"
[1:45:53] <xeros720> videogames have ruined us
[1:46:26] <LordPubious> ride that breeze with your poncho
[1:46:28] <+silvery_cricket> lego star wars taught me everything I need to know about physics
[1:47:06] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical physics
[1:47:14] <Triblade1992> I think it's on the outside above
[1:47:18] <+silvery_cricket> that wall looks like it has uncharted wall climb coloring
[1:47:24] <+silvery_cricket> or timb raider wall coloring
[1:47:29] <Triblade1992> there was something up there
[1:47:51] <Razmooten> if you progress don't you get higher up?
[1:48:15] <Kurudan> dude if you just use force lightning on it, it will solve all your problems! just embrace the dark side
[1:48:15] <+silvery_cricket> this game feels hyper expensive but also cheap
[1:48:16] <AnacondaVirtue> You might have to come back later with new powers. It is a Metroidvania after all
[1:48:21] <+silvery_cricket> like they spent the money in all the wrong places
[1:48:26] <Triblade1992> I think it's outside to the left
[1:48:41] <xeros720> agreed
[1:48:50] <Triblade1992> THERE!
[1:48:53] <biomegabear> Is this better than bloodborne?
[1:48:54] <Triblade1992> That's it!
[1:48:58] <+silvery_cricket> oh look at that climable thing
[1:48:59] <SuperVaderMan> aha!
[1:49:01] <Razmooten> dont forget frog room box
[1:49:15] <Triblade1992> IDK, better to check it out just in case
[1:49:20] <+silvery_cricket> can you climb down that pipe that runs down
[1:49:27] <Razmooten> frog room box
[1:49:31] <+frobeards> frog box
[1:49:53] <xeros720> yup, metroid, couldn't have said it more succinctly
[1:49:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @silvery_cricket they spent it all on ultra god tier graphics and forgot to spend it on fun gameplay features...like most of the western triple A game publishers do nowadays. I mean just compare Dead Rising 1 with 4
[1:49:57] <+silvery_cricket> Was this made by the people that made Rachet and Clank
[1:50:01] <+silvery_cricket> or Jax and Daxter
[1:50:12] <RiverBirch> what the fuck was that lad
[1:50:17] <xeros720> respawn
[1:50:21] <Torivore> But Plague, the frog box
[1:50:26] <biomegabear> RECKLAW
[1:50:30] <xeros720> the titanfall guys, i think
[1:50:30] <Triblade1992> isn't red more overplayed than blue and green though?
[1:50:33] <SuperVaderMan> look at that big good boy
[1:50:38] <+silvery_cricket> I dont know why but this reminds me of ratchet and crank alot
[1:50:41] <ziggyjesus> @silvery_cricket no, by respawn, who made Titanfall 2, which was really good
[1:50:42] <+CursedNobleman> dillydopydosaurus? LUL
[1:50:43] <+brave_sj> He looks like a good boy
[1:50:52] <biomegabear> sith monsters
[1:51:10] <+silvery_cricket> that building still looks like a penis
[1:51:13] <Triblade1992> Don't remind me of Mother AKA Aboloth.
[1:51:23] <%MarkSoupial> LUL spoilerbot
[1:51:23] <RiverBirch> "Do YOU wanna study the feeding habits of the giant skyscraping sized monster?"
[1:51:28] <Triblade1992> That was a dumb DUMB Sith monster
[1:52:01] <+silvery_cricket> I want to punt this little robot
[1:52:12] <+silvery_cricket> because I feel it was focus tested to make me love it
[1:52:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I guess that the only time Star Wars cared about animals was in the Last Jedi....and let's forget that
[1:52:20] <+silvery_cricket> wall run
[1:52:24] <Triblade1992> I think it's something you wall run
[1:52:27] <+silvery_cricket> Titanfall 2 Wall Run
[1:52:36] <Snirtax> bet you it's hyper linear
[1:52:37] <xeros720> shirley doesn't care for your opinion
[1:52:40] <+silvery_cricket> look at the way the walls are lined up
[1:52:53] <+silvery_cricket> you will probably get a wall run later
[1:52:56] <+CursedNobleman> @morcego_cinzento_arts speaking of milking, i looked up ares on nexusmods LUL
[1:53:06] <Triblade1992> The way it's set up to wall run later
[1:53:21] <xeros720> yeah, look at that fuckin wallrun wall
[1:53:23] <Razmooten> its not yellow, so you cant interact with it
[1:53:26] <%MarkSoupial> wat u mean, that looks totally natural
[1:53:27] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @CursedNobleman caught anything interesting?
[1:53:44] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> You can stop a moving fan with your mind, but you can't learn wall.
[1:53:51] <piggypig> youre not super enough
[1:53:59] <+CursedNobleman> @morcego_cinzento_arts well, aside from the author having a fembot fetish? not really. it looks popular? LUL
[1:54:08] <+silvery_cricket> Oh a loot crate
[1:54:18] <Triblade1992> bingo
[1:54:20] <ziggyjesus> you can have your robot scan dead enemies
[1:54:30] <+CursedNobleman> maybe the red one has a different frequency or something to unlock?
[1:54:32] <%MarkSoupial> Horizon Zero Jedi
[1:54:56] <Triblade1992> Horizon Zero was such an easy plat
[1:55:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @CursedNobleman oh you mean the Daughter of Ares mod? I don't remember if they give you stats and gameplay buffs. But yeah it's mostly sexy bots
[1:55:11] <+silvery_cricket> Good thing these ancient jedi worship symbol save points are everywhere
[1:55:39] <TheDastardlyD> Ubert soft
[1:55:49] <Lkprime> the games that need to fill out a checklist of game mechanics
[1:55:56] <Triblade1992> That's western RPG stuff. JRPGS do something different even with the grids
[1:55:57] <+CursedNobleman> outer worlds kinda messed up their perks. just like this :(
[1:56:43] <ziggyjesus> The combat is just too simple. No pause combos or other stuff
[1:56:46] <TheDastardlyD> I want to bully creatures with telekinesis
[1:56:55] <%MarkSoupial> if you're gonna jedi, you might as well go all out
[1:57:07] <somelurker> the combat in the force unleashed was great for force nonsense
[1:57:09] <+CursedNobleman> @TheDastardlyD i just beat breath of the wild, thats some prime telekinesis bullying LUL
[1:57:23] <SwagetronPrime> will you upload these to youtube?
[1:57:45] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Destroy All Humans had amazing levels of animal ad human abuse with telekinesis
[1:58:01] <Triblade1992> Oh man I wish he would have fallen off
[1:58:29] <ziggyjesus> Force Unleashed gave you telekenesis off the bat to let you bully Rebels and Stormtroopers
[1:58:31] <%MarkSoupial> oh man
[1:58:41] <Triblade1992> probably weaker
[1:58:45] <%MarkSoupial> inb4 you chase this one and it's supposed to be that one you killed
[1:58:45] <+CursedNobleman> @ziggyjesus so many space windows
[1:58:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> heroic jedi kills local wildlife
[1:59:08] <%MarkSoupial> uhh
[1:59:09] <+xanochoy> what
[1:59:12] <+CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:59:14] <%MarkSoupial> nice superbounce
[1:59:15] <Triblade1992> YEET
[1:59:20] <xeros720> bouncy boy
[1:59:27] <ziggyjesus> Not as strong as the last one, but can fly instead
[1:59:56] <RiverBirch> I've been playing DS2 lately
[1:59:57] <TheDastardlyD> Oh boy pivoting enemies
[2:00:00] <ziggyjesus> This one wasn't as attack-happy as the last one too
[2:00:02] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> Supreme tracking on that one.
[2:00:02] <RiverBirch> Fuck the Shrine of Amanra
[2:00:03] <Triblade1992> Wasn't that Dark Souls 3 too?
[2:00:08] <RiverBirch> I hate that late so much.
[2:00:16] <RiverBirch> lake*
[2:00:20] <+silvery_cricket> You ever look at a name and be like "That was made by smashing keys on a keyboard"
[2:00:28] <+ghostmutton> That thing is now hanging out with Luke
[2:00:28] <+silvery_cricket> GHojl
[2:00:44] <ziggyjesus> "Change the world. My final message. Goodbye."
[2:00:45] <+silvery_cricket> Look I made a star wars protagonist name
[2:00:56] <Triblade1992> wall run lol
[2:01:00] <TheDastardlyD> Okay now that's absolutely wall runnable
[2:01:15] <+silvery_cricket> Force fart at it
[2:01:22] <Triblade1992> I think he was suppose to scan it
[2:01:36] <Torivore> Probably another force power
[2:01:47] <chroma3> you already scaned it
[2:02:19] <Torivore> Glows like your slow time prmpts but a different color
[2:02:21] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> you scanned it when trying to scan froggo
[2:02:47] <Triblade1992> I think it was just that one boss
[2:03:21] <Kurudan> new grinding spot!
[2:03:30] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Grind the force
[2:04:00] <%MarkSoupial> the force is not a power you have, it';s the number of frogs you kill
[2:04:11] <SumKnowBuddy> para fish? but theres only one.
[2:04:30] <+pwnjones> The crunchy, chocolately cocoa XP
[2:04:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Plant that seed with the force
[2:04:40] <%MarkSoupial> get edgeguarded
[2:04:55] <+CursedNobleman> parafish OP plz nerf
[2:05:36] <Triblade1992> wall run again
[2:05:43] <+pwnjones> M'troid.

[2:06:55] <TheDastardlyD> rune
[2:07:00] <+vandesdelca0> that's dumb
[2:07:01] <%MarkSoupial> is this robot just entirely how natural curiosity is supposed to work?
[2:07:10] <+silvery_cricket> Look at that rat tail
[2:07:14] <SumKnowBuddy> oh god he has the rat tail
[2:07:15] <AnacondaVirtue> He has the shitty rat ponytail
[2:07:16] <+silvery_cricket> that means he is a CHOSEN ONE
[2:07:17] <%MarkSoupial> we Psi Ops???
[2:07:18] <The_Swedish_X> Hi travis
[2:07:18] <+pwnjones> LOOKATOS FEET

[2:07:19] <xeros720> this reminds me i need to get Control
[2:07:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the allows you to absolve the powers of anima;s
[2:07:54] <stranger59> Get your Ninja Gaiden on.
[2:07:55] <+silvery_cricket> look at that idle stance
[2:07:56] <Triblade1992> Guess now you can go back and get back stuff
[2:08:09] <+photas10> How far in is Plague?
[2:08:10] <+Draylle> mouth looks a little off
[2:08:11] <ninetales8491> he does
[2:08:12] <+silvery_cricket> oh look at his hands
[2:08:15] <+silvery_cricket> the way they clamp
[2:08:16] <Cyral_Drive> This is actually the future
[2:08:16] <Kurudan> not everyone is a model lolol
[2:08:19] <+pwnjones> He's recieved much of the rod's wisdom
[2:08:20] <The_Swedish_X> still doing tutorials
[2:08:23] <%MarkSoupial> looks like they reused some starkiller assets from unleashed
[2:08:24] <TheDastardlyD> Oh man tiny babby hands
[2:08:35] <The_Swedish_X> then again those can go on for a while
[2:08:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Use your force powers to play Prince of Persia Sands of Time
[2:08:37] <ziggyjesus> Wish he remembered earlier
[2:08:38] <stranger59> You just remembered you could do that.
[2:08:47] <AnacondaVirtue> I think you're on to something
[2:08:50] <+Punishedkaiger> Backtrack now I guess
[2:08:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why can't you use the force to runn up a diagonal surface?
[2:09:04] <+silvery_cricket> YAHHOO
[2:09:06] <%MarkSoupial> uh oh
[2:09:06] <+silvery_cricket> WOOPIE
[2:09:18] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> That looks real silly.
[2:09:21] <TheDastardlyD> Now you learn the backwards long jump
[2:09:27] <+silvery_cricket> Wall run the circumference of the room
[2:09:27] <Triblade1992> That's some hilarious stuff
[2:09:38] <+ghostmutton> Think I saw Max trying to do this too
[2:09:39] <The_Swedish_X> god forbid eli have some fun and laughs
[2:10:01] <+silvery_cricket> ITS A CRATE DRAGON
[2:10:04] <+silvery_cricket> I KNOW THAT THING
[2:10:07] <SuperVaderMan> Big dragon be like "the hell's this guy doin"
[2:10:07] <+silvery_cricket> ITS A THING I KNOW
[2:10:11] <+pwnjones> *Shakes fist* SEEEEATH
[2:10:16] <Triblade1992> MY LEGS!
[2:10:24] <%MarkSoupial> at least it's not dark souls fall damage
[2:10:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It;s not Dark Souls 2 level of fall damage
[2:10:57] <+pwnjones> M'ap
[2:10:59] <%MarkSoupial> so yes, robot is there for dumdum player
[2:11:17] <+silvery_cricket> Now I kinda want a 3 minute long death animation from falling super far where its him just screaming in pain while bleeding out
[2:11:18] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> jump
[2:11:19] <Triblade1992> I think you have to jump at the last minute
[2:11:55] <Triblade1992> double jump from that
[2:11:57] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:12:04] <+silvery_cricket> Thanks Nightbot
[2:13:00] <+silvery_cricket> This game plays so much like Lego Star wars it is astounding
[2:13:03] <+pwnjones> Murder has taught you well
[2:13:12] <+silvery_cricket> its just lego star wars with photorealistic graphics and no building
[2:13:33] <+pwnjones> So without the charm
[2:13:39] <+silvery_cricket> yes
[2:13:55] <+silvery_cricket> you thwack things in the same way
[2:14:01] <+silvery_cricket> and you gotta scan stuff in the same way
[2:14:03] <ziggyjesus> God, lego star wars was so good
[2:14:36] <Triblade1992> Can't wait for the Skywalker saga Lego Star Wars
[2:14:53] <+pwnjones> Try tongue but hole
[2:14:56] <Triblade1992> Weren't we all though?
[2:15:03] <+silvery_cricket> "Whoever owned this bag masturbated 6 times a day"
[2:15:18] <SuperVaderMan> No jedi on coruscant has ever been frustrated with the jedi council before
[2:15:18] <Triblade1992> That bag was secretly the bag of Barriss Offee
[2:15:36] <+silvery_cricket> Luke shit in this bag when he couldnt find a toilet once
[2:15:47] <+pwnjones> Plague you goddamn know why
[2:15:53] <stranger59> Jedi brand wall run wall
[2:15:57] <+vandesdelca0> at least they tried
[2:15:59] <+pwnjones> It's a space billboard
[2:16:09] <Kurudan> it a Jedi obstacle course
[2:16:20] <xeros720> more bling for your lightsaber
[2:16:25] <stranger59> Why does the droid have to make love to the box to get the loot?
[2:16:34] <Triblade1992> I think the only viable explanation is that it was a padawan training facility
[2:16:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It's a Sapce Billboard for Twi'lek strip clubs
[2:16:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> space
[2:16:45] <%MarkSoupial> jedi planet Oolacile
[2:16:52] <xeros720> dark soul elevator
[2:17:00] <+silvery_cricket> God this is made by the people that made Titan Fall 2
[2:17:03] <stranger59> Everything in Star Wars is designed with minimal safety concerns.
[2:17:11] <+silvery_cricket> and they couldnt use their own engine for it
[2:17:18] <Cyral_Drive> lul
[2:17:19] <+silvery_cricket> they probably had to use the DICE engine
[2:17:22] <Triblade1992> That would have been great if he fell off
[2:17:49] <+silvery_cricket> probably got told to make it play like tf2 but instead of using their engine they had to use the DICE engine
[2:17:53] <ziggyjesus> @silvery_cricket Yeah what a let down, TF2 was fun except it was killed by releasing near battlefield 1
[2:18:08] <+pwnjones> Oota jawa wookie nipple pinchy? Come on down to Quark's! Quarks is fun! Come on down! Don't walk, run!
[2:18:15] <+silvery_cricket> the wall run in this is so flacid
[2:18:15] <%MarkSoupial> maybe this is why people join the dark side, whenever a jedi rests only their enemies respawn
[2:18:37] <stranger59> Box is too powerful
[2:18:41] <Triblade1992> I think you need to upgrade your droid
[2:18:43] <Laecerelius> It said you needed a repaired scomp link
[2:18:46] <morcego_cinzento_arts> remember folks that they gave up on making TitanFall 3 over Apex Legends and this bullshit. Let that sink in
[2:18:53] <+ghostmutton> That's a cool thing
[2:19:02] <Torivore> Gotta get the advanced chest opening tutorial first
[2:19:56] <+silvery_cricket> I WONDER WHAT COULD IT BE
[2:20:09] <+ghostmutton> It's not even helpful information
[2:20:26] <%MarkSoupial> a name someone made for this thing for some reason
[2:21:09] <+pwnjones> Can that robot tell you where the BTs are
[2:21:12] <%MarkSoupial> so did everyone who lived here zip around on this droid?
[2:21:42] <stranger59> @MarkSoupial Yes, that's why they're all dead now.
[2:21:57] <%MarkSoupial> rip
[2:22:25] <%MarkSoupial> ziplines and parkour
[2:22:33] <TheDastardlyD> They had to grow vines
[2:22:34] <ShivaTheMemeDiva> What if you couldn't climb or vine swing? Did you just die outright?
[2:22:41] <Triblade1992> The only way this would be explainable would be a Padawan training facility
[2:22:52] <Torivore> Titanfall pilots lived here
[2:22:55] <Triblade1992> a bit
[2:22:56] <ninetales8491> no
[2:22:56] <+xanochoy> yes
[2:22:58] <%MarkSoupial> i actually did
[2:22:59] <+Draylle> tried once, it hurt
[2:23:04] <TheDastardlyD> Yeah
[2:23:07] <+whiskey_wolfe_> We didn't wallrun in rural Ireland.
[2:23:07] <ReNhoSoft1> I tried to, never got more than 1 kick
[2:23:09] <xeros720> i did once, not for long
[2:23:12] <+whiskey_wolfe_> The church hated it.
[2:23:12] <The_Swedish_X> I tried running up walls.
[2:23:15] <Kurudan> never tried
[2:23:16] <The_Swedish_X> never really stuck
[2:23:25] <ziggyjesus> I tried to, I also tried double jumping too
[2:23:31] <TheDastardlyD> I could run on the walls in a lazy river
[2:23:33] <+xanochoy> i did, i hit myself but i has fun
[2:23:33] <Triblade1992> Was Pat Bolvin the ball
[2:23:47] <%MarkSoupial> LUL
[2:23:57] <%MarkSoupial> wait so
[2:24:00] <+ghostmutton> And the happiest monster
[2:24:16] <%MarkSoupial> all of this rock, like the entire area, ERODED?
[2:24:38] <Triblade1992> you can wall run to the door
[2:25:33] <Triblade1992> maybe?
[2:25:37] <%hgtarras> Did you pick that color?
[2:26:24] <ahegotrigger> hes ready now
[2:26:26] <somelurker> god damn it plague
[2:26:27] <Triblade1992> Boglings
[2:26:33] <SumKnowBuddy> its like a hyper realistic eevee
[2:26:38] <SumKnowBuddy> creepy
[2:27:07] <stranger59> Every frame is so dense
[2:27:34] <Triblade1992> maybe
[2:28:31] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical Frogarina
[2:28:58] <%hgtarras> How many light saber types are there. I seen that there is a double blade one
[2:29:00] <+pwnjones> Boglins?
[2:29:11] <%MarkSoupial> SLIGHTLY faster
[2:29:29] <stranger59> slightly faster, much higher risk of falling to death
[2:30:05] <ziggyjesus> hopefully we can use the inquisitor lightsaber and fly with it like in star war: rebels
[2:30:14] <Triblade1992> Palps would enjoy all the game ending on the jedi
[2:30:33] <%MarkSoupial> mphDerp can jedi fly by force lifting their own shoes?
[2:30:50] <+pwnjones> Can you?
[2:31:10] <morcego_cinzento_arts> They can but the Jedi teaching forbid that along with premarital sex
[2:31:11] <%MarkSoupial> i mean, we have psi ops tutorials in this, and that is something you could do in that
[2:31:41] <%MarkSoupial> half jedi, half airbender
[2:31:50] <+pwnjones> You can if you find the right blue spot on the ground.
[2:32:02] <+pwnjones> Alas
[2:32:07] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[2:32:18] <%MarkSoupial> harry potter was right, having magic makes you really uncreative
[2:32:57] <Triblade1992> that's what I like to see. smaller linear areas, more focused content
[2:33:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Hell there a scene in episode 2 that Anakin picks a pear and a knife with a force to cut it and give a half to Padme. He mentions that Obi-Wan would scald him for this. So yeah the Jedi like you to dedicate your life to the force but not do useful and trivial shit with it
[2:34:06] <+Punishedkaiger> That's not why he would've gotten scolded
[2:34:10] <stranger59> So Obi-Wan would scold him if he wiped his ass with the Force?
[2:34:18] <Cyral_Drive> estus shard pog
[2:34:18] <SuperVaderMan> estus upgrade!
[2:34:42] <stranger59> That's a big speaker
[2:34:54] <+pwnjones> The sacred Jedi TP!
[2:34:56] <%MarkSoupial> move things? impossible. BEND TIME? no problem
[2:35:03] <Triblade1992> I think its something you pull
[2:35:24] <%hgtarras> How can he use force slow of time but can’t do push or pull.
[2:35:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @stranger59 Probably.
[2:35:47] <%hgtarras> That should be like the first thing you learn is to push
[2:35:57] <Triblade1992> he wants to play like my dog Remmy
[2:36:14] <%MarkSoupial> that roll burned like 300,000 calories
[2:36:24] <+pwnjones> How would that thing score on the Harkness test though
[2:36:38] <Triblade1992> muts are more healthy than pure breeds
[2:36:45] <%MarkSoupial> yup
[2:37:42] <+pwnjones> Would you use the force to sex?
[2:37:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Muts aren't the result of incestuos breeding. so yeah
[2:37:58] <Laecerelius> IT's a metroid
[2:38:11] <Triblade1992> I think this is the main bonefire/hunter's dream
[2:38:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> one could use the force to substitute sex
[2:38:38] <+pwnjones> Can one learn such powers?
[2:38:57] <+ghostmutton> There's a big lizard platypus you can't belly rub yet
[2:39:06] <%MarkSoupial> pjdTouchdown
[2:39:07] <+whiskey_wolfe_> Broke my pledge on day 1
[2:39:07] <Kurudan> failed
[2:39:09] <President_valentine> failed day one
[2:39:11] <+nesence2> failed
[2:39:12] <stranger59> Lost the moment you did a wall run
[2:39:15] <Triblade1992> failed day one
[2:39:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Only time will tell, pwnjones
[2:39:18] <Cyral_Drive> don't care
[2:39:36] <%MarkSoupial> i dunno, man, you smush those eyes together just right...
[2:39:44] <+Punishedkaiger> NNN is a silly concept
[2:39:51] <+pwnjones> I don't think I lost, if you take my meaning
[2:39:51] <stranger59> "Bustin' makes me feel good" - Anakin Skywalker
[2:39:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i didn't failed cause i didn't even tried noNutNovember in the first place. To fail you first need to try
[2:40:07] <ziggyjesus> Still going strong due to college stress, lets go boys
[2:40:09] <%StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[2:40:09] <Triblade1992> the droid makes more sense to get descriptions than the Force
[2:40:17] <%MarkSoupial> time for more psi ops
[2:40:33] <%MarkSoupial> nope MAGIC DOOR
[2:40:44] <%MarkSoupial> secret loading screen
[2:41:05] <+Draylle> i feel like a lot of these 3rd person adventure games have a lot of sideways crevice walking
[2:41:07] <+pwnjones> You broke the game.
[2:41:12] <Triblade1992> Hoping this isn't like Force Unleashed where they shove in a bunch of Sith lords
[2:41:33] <+pwnjones> I hope he has to shove in a bunch of Sith lords.
[2:41:39] <%MarkSoupial> Bray'tak?
[2:41:50] <+whiskey_wolfe_> He's Master Morty Goldstein
[2:41:54] <%MarkSoupial> we jaffa now
[2:41:57] <SuperVaderMan> You have an open skylight here. Anyone could've just flown in
[2:42:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the obly type of shoving in with a gang of sith lords that is fun is in bed
[2:42:13] <ziggyjesus> @Triblade1992 It's inquisitors instead. One I do wanna shove in
[2:42:20] <%MarkSoupial> nice pop out
[2:42:29] <ReNhoSoft1> Gotta make it easier for the sith to hunt them down
[2:42:38] <SuperVaderMan> "In this vault is a really stupid Macguffin for the story"
[2:42:41] <%MarkSoupial> you need the 3 lord souls
[2:42:53] <+vandesdelca0> so he was waiting for someone that could wall run?
[2:43:23] <Triblade1992> @ziggyjesus lol. However in all seriousness at least we are dealing with living ex Jedi instead of Droid that somehow can perform a crap ton of Sith transformations
[2:43:27] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> The barrier is BD-1
[2:43:33] <+pwnjones> Are you a sex bot?
[2:43:33] <+ghostmutton> But the droid had to befriend whoever came in
[2:43:46] <+pwnjones> How big are your ports?
[2:43:51] <stranger59> The rules for space wizards are weird
[2:43:57] <ziggyjesus> Cal is hornt and wants to fugg the droid
[2:44:42] <+pwnjones> So we need the three stooges, Harpo, Gummo and Zeffo
[2:44:57] <Triblade1992> it's space rock.
[2:45:01] <stranger59> No, it's made of the Force
[2:45:17] <morcego_cinzento_arts> force tony hawk skating in the mud
[2:45:34] <ReNhoSoft1> Also, anyone could have captured the droid and taken the info, jedy dont appear to be all that smart
[2:45:48] <Triblade1992> lol that's hilarious
[2:45:53] <Triblade1992> bugs
[2:45:54] <+pwnjones> Mandalorian can stab this thing with a tiny knife and 1-hit it
[2:46:04] <+ghostmutton> Only a Sith deals in jank
[2:46:12] <Triblade1992> Ancient Sith Technique of T Posing.
[2:46:12] <stranger59> Only a Sith deals in cryptocurrency
[2:46:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> At this point, it's cannon that Jedi are as smart as a bag of hammers
[2:46:33] <+pwnjones> This is just holoporn
[2:46:42] <SuperVaderMan> spooky planet
[2:46:47] <Triblade1992> yes
[2:46:48] <ziggyjesus> yes
[2:46:51] <SuperVaderMan> That witch planet
[2:46:51] <%MarkSoupial> when do you meet Teal'C?
[2:46:51] <morcego_cinzento_arts> And not the goodkind of holoporn
[2:46:58] <stranger59> Oh, neat!
[2:46:58] <ziggyjesus> and where Maul is from
[2:47:08] <+pwnjones> Quark has the good kind
[2:47:18] <ScreamLord> Convenient that all the Dark Side places sound evil as fuck
[2:47:33] <+pwnjones> Baphomere't
[2:48:02] <Torivore> Baphmodad
[2:48:03] <Triblade1992> boys get to be unga bunga, and the girls go ooga booga
[2:48:11] <Triblade1992> that's Dathomir
[2:48:13] <%MarkSoupial> so Romulans and Remans
[2:48:50] <qeridexis> how's the game so far
[2:49:05] <+pwnjones> Darthomire
[2:49:24] <%MarkSoupial> force
[2:49:27] <+pwnjones> Costanza
[2:49:32] <Triblade1992> BD-1 is a puppy
[2:49:33] <ScreamLord> Y'know, Lightsabers are cool and all, but I think Force-Infused weapons like what the old Je'Dai Order in the Expanded Universe way more interesting
[2:49:40] <stranger59> So they call their sofas "sofas"? that's weird to me
[2:49:57] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical
[2:49:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Well now we know that the captain did some stuff in that sofa that includes lots of oily liquids
[2:50:03] <Cyral_Drive> just me or the aliens look way better than the humans
[2:50:13] <stranger59> I don't know why this and Solo both needed a "bad Rocket Raccoon".
[2:50:19] <%MarkSoupial> Force Unleashed is canon confirmed
[2:50:24] <+pwnjones> A Jedi named Chrysler Cordoba was building reasonably priced luxury speeders with rich Mandalorian leather
[2:50:28] <ahegotrigger> cant wait to kill Vader in this game
[2:50:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Cyral_Drive they actually do
[2:50:48] <Torivore> Dude what if Cal is Vader that'd be wild
[2:50:50] <Triblade1992> Hi Ewan Mcgregor
[2:50:56] <ziggyjesus> Can't wait to side with the emperor
[2:50:56] <Eirykr> In the kids show the Inquisitors find a bunch of force sensitive children too, possibly from that list
[2:51:07] <Eirykr> Rebels
[2:51:11] <ScreamLord> Pat loves Greez
[2:51:23] <Triblade1992> The Jedi need to be changed into something new. Like a Skywalker order where both light and dark are used
[2:51:28] <stranger59> She ate a baby
[2:51:35] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> that was James Arnold Taylor not Ewan
[2:51:46] <%MarkSoupial> i'm sure it's fine
[2:51:53] <ziggyjesus> Even if you don't want to be a Jedi, there's no reason to cut yourself off from the force
[2:51:58] <%MarkSoupial> there's NO WAY she's any kind of sith or anything i'm sure
[2:51:58] <SuperVaderMan> Remember in Kotor 2 how cutting the main character off from the force was a really really big deal? Now anyone can do it I guess and it's whatever
[2:52:19] <+pwnjones> that's planet Fukko
[2:52:22] <ziggyjesus> Just don't practice the tenants of the Jedi religion, or whatever
[2:52:37] <%MarkSoupial> mechaSmug i got some seeds for ya, bud
[2:52:42] <stranger59> Little alien dude demands your seed
[2:52:57] <beetbo2> ^
[2:53:02] <beetbo2> couldn't have said it better
[2:53:19] <Eirykr> Being force sensitive seems like a curse, even ignoring being hunted down by the Empire
[2:53:20] <Triblade1992> Luke Lightsaber tip
[2:53:30] <+pwnjones> Why does it need a floaty stand, just lay it on the table
[2:53:38] <ScreamLord> Pat pointed out that it's kinda dumb when they say a normal sentence but then add needless Space Words into to make it sound Spacier. Like Umbafan Glass or whatever instead of just Glass
[2:53:48] <%MarkSoupial> i mean
[2:54:01] <qeridexis> because gameplay spoiler, plague
[2:54:07] <ScreamLord> Probably used to be a double-ended saber
[2:54:19] <ninetales8491> LUL
[2:54:23] <%MarkSoupial> nah, the hull isn't made of bugs
[2:54:26] <stranger59> Saber-chucks
[2:54:42] <+pwnjones> Saber chucks.
[2:54:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> one of the things i liked about the Old Republic mmo is that there is a alien species that all are born force users and none of them bought into the jedi/sith bullshit. Now imagine if an ex jedi simply decided to not follow this weird cult but also didn't decided to not use this amazing super power
[2:55:17] <+pwnjones> So, Dooku
[2:55:44] <SuperVaderMan> These are the only 3 planets that exist
[2:55:51] <stranger59> This is it
[2:55:51] <Triblade1992> I don't think they will
[2:56:01] <beetbo2> peepee
[2:56:01] <+pwnjones> Are these the dragon balls
[2:56:06] <beetbo2> yes
[2:56:19] <Snirtax> Could always try that view map button. Might have something to do with the map. Who knows
[2:56:25] <+pwnjones> I wish for Goku to stay dead this time.
[2:56:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Dooku bought in another type of cult that wears hot topic discounts and wats to enslave the universe. That isn't much of a better alternative
[2:57:09] <+pwnjones> Could have been worse, Doooku could have joined the church of scientology.
[2:57:26] <Triblade1992> The problem is how the prequels turned the Jedi into apathetic hypocrites.
[2:57:42] <+pwnjones> And massive dummies
[2:57:46] <AnacondaVirtue> Stop dinging your pots and pans, Plague
[2:57:48] <Triblade1992> The right way to make a compelling but flawed organization would be the Soul Society from Bleach
[2:58:16] <Triblade1992> Instead we got the dumb dumbs who fell for a dumb trick
[2:58:22] <ScreamLord> @PlagueOfGripes Did you know that Inquisitors can use their stupid rotating lightsabers to fly through the air like helicopters?
[2:58:27] <SuperVaderMan> no
[2:58:33] <AnacondaVirtue> Peanut butter on celery? With raisins on it?
[2:58:34] <ninetales8491> no
[2:58:38] <Torivore> Yup
[2:58:38] <%MarkSoupial> yes
[2:58:40] <ziggyjesus> Yes, celery with peanutbutter and raisins
[2:58:42] <Makaru225> yeah, thats it
[2:58:45] <+pwnjones> I wish Dooku had learned to fly with the force, then flown up to the Jedi temple and then refused to teach anyone how to do it
[2:59:06] <ScreamLord> WutFace
[2:59:08] <Triblade1992> EW
[2:59:09] <SuperVaderMan> DansGame
[2:59:10] <Triblade1992> WHAT
[2:59:10] <Makaru225> stop
[2:59:13] <AnacondaVirtue> That is WRETCHED
[2:59:14] <Professor_Malice> neat
[2:59:15] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> sbfpSetIn
[2:59:15] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @pwnjones Maybe the jedi are the scientologists of Star Wars. we might never know
[2:59:18] <SumKnowBuddy> the fuck
[2:59:18] <Cyral_Drive> cease
[2:59:23] <%MarkSoupial> DansGame
[2:59:25] <Torivore> You're right, that does sound vile
[2:59:29] <%MarkSoupial> this explains so much
[2:59:34] <+frobeards> UGH
[2:59:34] <ninetales8491> eh
[2:59:38] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> NotLikeThis
[2:59:53] <+pwnjones> Except they require your children, not credits
[3:00:05] <ScreamLord> OK
[3:00:06] <%MarkSoupial> gonna go ahead and don't
[3:00:06] <xeros720> i think i dodged a bullet
[3:00:09] <Cyral_Drive> dath
[3:00:10] <Torivore> Deal
[3:00:10] <Triblade1992> Dathomir
[3:00:11] <AnacondaVirtue> Dathomir, all the way
[3:00:16] <+PlaneWalkerDavid> Dathomir
[3:00:29] <xeros720> that's a lot of chest
[3:00:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @pwnjones Dooku does levitate a bit in one of the episodes of the clone wars Gendy cartoon
[3:00:33] <stranger59> Time to Mario Odyssey this
[3:00:34] <%MarkSoupial> Darth Mirror
[3:00:41] <+pwnjones> Nice.
[3:00:43] <Triblade1992> 43 chests reminds me of KH3's use of chests in the Pirates world or the Big Hero 6 world
[3:01:03] <morcego_cinzento_arts> maybe kids are credits in star wars...considering Naabo
[3:01:03] <Professor_Malice> Eat your heart out Star Citizen
[3:01:13] <%MarkSoupial> now we know about those load times
[3:01:13] <xeros720> wow, that's some nice effects
[3:01:23] <Triblade1992> So from one cult to another
[3:01:25] <stranger59> Then Grievous killed them all
[3:01:40] <ziggyjesus> Clone Wars TV show is cannon i guess
[3:01:41] <Triblade1992> Assaj got killed off
[3:01:46] <ziggyjesus> Ventriss
[3:01:47] <kiwiredgrave> ventress?
[3:01:49] <AnacondaVirtue> Asaj Ventress
[3:01:52] <ScreamLord> Ventress?
[3:02:00] <Coffee_JD> you gotta sit down
[3:02:14] <%MarkSoupial> not-so-fast travel
[3:02:24] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Asaj Ventress. AKA kinda hot in a odd way sith girl
[3:02:39] <%MarkSoupial> that seems like a bad landing spot
[3:02:44] <ScreamLord> That big ass sail is so pointless lol
[3:03:01] <%MarkSoupial> big-ass space sails are usually heat-sinks
[3:03:20] <Triblade1992> now we only have Barriss Offee to shows up post Return of the Jedi
[3:03:37] <SuperVaderMan> a pretty good dath
[3:03:45] <JittersCaffeine> I remember seeing the theory that Barriss is one of the inquisitors in Rebels
[3:03:45] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical next gen grafix
[3:03:46] <ScreamLord> It's a good looking game
[3:03:55] <%MarkSoupial> EXCEPT for the player
[3:04:13] <Triblade1992> lol
[3:04:41] <%MarkSoupial> like, they knew the grabs were bad so they made falling not full death
[3:04:52] <NotLysander> tiny ranco
[3:04:54] <+pwnjones> Dumrancor
[3:04:57] <ScreamLord> Runtcor
[3:05:04] <Triblade1992> Rancor in RotJ just wanted to be left alone
[3:05:10] <Professor_Malice> Mad, Mad, Hungry - Dopecor
[3:05:41] <SuperVaderMan> Is this a Dark Souls 3 enemy
[3:05:49] <JittersCaffeine> Oof. That sudden unblockable
[3:05:49] <kiwiredgrave> and this is where my story ends
[3:05:50] <%MarkSoupial> remember when you said at least it wasn't dark souls 3?
[3:05:51] <%MarkSoupial> LUL
[3:05:55] <ziggyjesus> Looks like he has a follow up right after you block one his attacks to catch you offguard
[3:06:03] <Torivore> Don't forget your heals
[3:06:03] <Triblade1992> remember how slow moving the rancor was in RotJ?
[3:06:15] <%MarkSoupial> now to be fair
[3:06:17] <+pwnjones> Runtcor used Face Rip, It was super effective!
[3:06:17] <otakon17> yo Plague and folks
[3:06:27] <otakon17> the stims? near instant but it takes a second to trigger
[3:06:29] <%MarkSoupial> jabba kept that one in a room that was somehow too small for it to fit
[3:06:38] <otakon17> I just got done watching Pat play through
[3:06:44] <ScreamLord> My main gripe with the Star Wars franchise is that it seems like all the actually cool stuff happens OUTSIDE of the movies. Like the movies are kinda boring compared to everything else
[3:07:16] <+pwnjones> Lightsabers are WEAK
[3:07:33] <JittersCaffeine> @ScreamLord There's a lot of interesting stuff to be mined for a TTRPG game
[3:07:37] <otakon17> woo
[3:07:41] <otakon17> that guy seems like bullshit
[3:07:45] <otakon17> you got Push yet?
[3:07:47] <Triblade1992> That enemy is just so sparatic
[3:07:47] <Coffee_JD> I don't understand why they want to punish you for correctly parrying
[3:07:53] <otakon17> OH
[3:07:57] <otakon17> you want the "wrong" way
[3:08:13] <otakon17> you gotta parry multiple times
[3:08:17] <Jrockoni> how did this bloodborne monster shit up my starwars game
[3:08:22] <otakon17> Pat saw it on multiple enemies
[3:08:32] <%MarkSoupial> LUL running jump bad, standing jump fine
[3:08:56] <otakon17> like he recovers INSTANTLY
[3:08:56] <NotLysander> what I don't understand about modern Jedi games is that Jedi never use Guns.
[3:09:05] <%MarkSoupial> right?
[3:09:06] <otakon17> THEY ARE
[3:09:22] <otakon17> fall to your death yes you can
[3:09:29] <JittersCaffeine> Huh. They actually were fighting
[3:09:41] <%MarkSoupial> wait
[3:09:48] <otakon17> they were but it seems like the bug will sporadically switch targets
[3:09:51] <%MarkSoupial> so who do you hit to get your sols back now?
[3:09:53] <%MarkSoupial> the cliff?
[3:10:02] <otakon17> "Fuck you cliff gimme back my XP!"
[3:10:07] <Triblade1992> this isn't like Dark Souls where you can use gravity to game end the enemies
[3:10:15] <otakon17> you can actually
[3:10:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @NotLysander ever since the prequels the did a batman with Jedi and sith. thy don't use guns unless on their vehicles
[3:10:31] <%MarkSoupial> they DID say it was a dangerous place
[3:10:34] <otakon17> this game BEGS for a stealth attack
[3:10:41] <somelurker> i think its lived up to the name
[3:10:42] <otakon17> he's sliding off the cliff
[3:10:42] <%MarkSoupial> they just didn't say it was design dangerous
[3:10:48] <%MarkSoupial> LUL
[3:10:52] <+Draylle> LUL nice
[3:10:52] <otakon17> NOPE oh lawd he's a comming
[3:10:56] <%MarkSoupial> AAA videogames
[3:11:09] <Torivore> It is also a force user
[3:11:15] <AnacondaVirtue> Heal, you boob
[3:11:17] <+TheSaintJohn> oof
[3:11:18] <JittersCaffeine> Looks like you might need to let him flail and then get him when he falls over?
[3:11:22] <Triblade1992> that's why I HATE flailing enemies like this
[3:11:32] <otakon17> yeah seems like your best bet is to just poke the bastard
[3:11:41] <Triblade1992> Bloodborne was more fair than that enemy
[3:11:44] <otakon17> poke, run away, poke
[3:11:46] <ziggyjesus> Do your stims recharge when you meditate like estus at a bonfire?
[3:11:52] <otakon17> yes
[3:11:56] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:11:57] <Jrockoni> plague playing on normal or jedi master?
[3:12:02] <Triblade1992> normal
[3:12:08] <ziggyjesus> Reminds me of the big shark enemies in the Bloodborne DLC
[3:12:18] <otakon17> this game REALLY needs a stealth attack option on unaware enemies
[3:12:22] <ziggyjesus> Those were a nightmare, heh
[3:12:24] <NotLysander> @morcego_cinzento_arts I don't think that's right. the Jedis use blasters in the prequel moves and in the cartoons since then
[3:12:30] <Jrockoni> yeah tried that guy on hard and realized that this plan was garbage
[3:12:34] <Triblade1992> yep
[3:12:39] <NotLysander> they don't like to but they use them
[3:12:45] <otakon17> okay so slow when he lunges, get behind and hit
[3:12:55] <Cyral_Drive> seems to unfreeze when you hit
[3:13:04] <NotLysander> and I think in a, we are all gonna die situation they would use more guns
[3:13:04] <Triblade1992> they need to patch that BIG TIME
[3:13:05] <+TheSaintJohn> just do it perfect
[3:13:16] <otakon17> yeah the slow wears off as SOON as you hit the guys
[3:13:16] <BillieNoMates> Big guys need to be parried multiple times I think
[3:13:19] <otakon17> I don't like that
[3:13:25] <Torivore> Gotta parry his counter parry
[3:13:35] <otakon17> you gotta Sekiro it man
[3:13:37] <+Punishedkaiger> You're supposed to parry it a couple times in a row
[3:13:39] <otakon17> parry parry parry
[3:13:41] <ziggyjesus> try parrying his follow up instead of attacking right away
[3:13:47] <Partrap> don't question it, just get hit and get excited for next hit
[3:14:09] <+xanochoy> the dark souls of star wars
[3:14:09] <ziggyjesus> his attack right after parrying is designed to catch you
[3:14:21] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @NotLysander Obi-Wan used a blaster out of desperation and even scoffed at it "so uncivilized!" And all the other times was only the machine gun blasters from their space jets.
[3:14:39] <otakon17> there's that follow up again
[3:14:44] <otakon17> you gotta parry and parry again
[3:14:46] <ziggyjesus> ^
[3:15:04] <%MarkSoupial> maybe you need a divine weapon mphDerp
[3:15:06] <AncelDeLambert> heyya, Plague
[3:15:13] <%MarkSoupial> when do you get to kindle the bonfire?
[3:15:15] <Triblade1992> they need tot patch that
[3:15:16] <otakon17> I'm assuming you parry him a couple of times and then he'll be majorly vulnerable
[3:15:24] <AncelDeLambert> there's a place for dueling systems, this doesn't seem it
[3:15:54] <otakon17> oh the auto tracking is BAD in this game
[3:15:59] <otakon17> I hate that too, it's so cheap
[3:16:06] <otakon17> THER
[3:16:12] <%MarkSoupial> DansGame
[3:16:16] <otakon17> SO THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT
[3:16:21] <Triblade1992> WOW, REALLY
[3:16:22] <JittersCaffeine> Double parry to an autokill?
[3:16:22] <ziggyjesus> Thats even WORSE
[3:16:22] <derap41> So just chain parry
[3:16:23] <otakon17> WOW
[3:16:30] <otakon17> AND IT WAS JUST A LESSER NYDAK
[3:16:30] <%MarkSoupial> so it's a QTE without prompts and only one button
[3:16:31] <SuperVaderMan> Oh so you're not supposed to *fight* him, you just auto-kill him. That sucks A LOT
[3:16:32] <derap41> Its assassins creed fighting
[3:16:33] <stranger59> It didn't tell you there were GoW enemies!
[3:16:35] <Triblade1992> That's a QTE enemy
[3:16:37] <%MarkSoupial> it's Kingdom Hearts 2
[3:16:38] <AncelDeLambert> parrying ARMS with a LIGHTSABER is laughable
[3:16:40] <ziggyjesus> Just 3 parries and "YOU WIN!"
[3:16:40] <ninetales8491> pretty much
[3:16:40] <Partrap> wasn't it CINEMATIC tho?
[3:16:40] <otakon17> just wait till the GREATER Nydak shows up
[3:16:45] <%MarkSoupial> don't be Kingdom Hearts 2
[3:16:50] <Torivore> The way enemies tank lightsaber slashes in games make them feel like toys
[3:16:53] <stranger59> I hate those so much.
[3:16:54] <LordPubious> disinsitivizing playstyles is the new model!
[3:16:54] <otakon17> HEAL
[3:16:56] <ziggyjesus> Why even give it a healthbar
[3:16:58] <Cyral_Drive> lol imagine if that killed
[3:17:00] <Triblade1992> KH2 didn't do that though Mark
[3:17:02] <NAgent01> A QTE enemy?
[3:17:04] <JittersCaffeine> It would be better if there was some way to signpost that
[3:17:05] <otakon17> XD
[3:17:05] <derap41> @LordPubious even worse is how inconsistent it is
[3:17:10] <+pwnjones> lol
[3:17:12] <%MarkSoupial> pjdTouchdown
[3:17:12] <otakon17> seeds
[3:17:18] <Triblade1992> they gave you the ablity to take on enemies without hitting triangle
[3:17:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the forces does burn pussies
[3:17:43] <JittersCaffeine> I would if I had one
[3:17:44] <AncelDeLambert> Pat and Plague both chose the CORRECT lightsaber color
[3:17:52] <otakon17> okay the the KEY to the Nydaks is parry till they're vulnerable
[3:17:54] <%MarkSoupial> Notctoroc
[3:18:02] <otakon17> more skill points!
[3:18:02] <JittersCaffeine> acid blood is annoying
[3:18:02] <Samex_Comex> Kill the younglings!
[3:18:04] <ScreamLord> "Father Time sure took a bat to this planet."
[3:18:07] <AncelDeLambert> LUL I thought that read Bareback spider
[3:18:19] <otakon17> This is the Cascadia Bay of the this game
[3:18:24] <%caramello_man> Why can you parry with your lightsaber, when you can also cut off limbs? Silly star wars
[3:18:31] <JittersCaffeine> Isn't this where Darth Maul is from or something?
[3:18:31] <derap41> Pretty in an ugly brutal way though
[3:18:54] <stranger59> Was it when they raised the undead army?
[3:19:06] <Ekaelis> If You were to introduce new form of lighsaber Plague, what would it be?
[3:19:20] <$SWFanatic> Hate
[3:19:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> This palent feels like if a desert planet was covered in those blood weeds from War of the Worlds
[3:19:33] <otakon17> just passed some climbable dicks down there by the spider corpse you jut killed
[3:19:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> planet*
[3:19:40] <derap41> Put your finger in it
[3:19:41] <JittersCaffeine> gross
[3:19:46] <Triblade1992> It's like how Hans Zimmer like's blarring instruments
[3:20:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why did he pick the worst lightsaber color ever?
[3:20:01] <ScreamLord> They put their dead in gross cacoon pods?
[3:20:02] <%MarkSoupial> too bad guns dont exist in star wars
[3:20:03] <otakon17> least it LOOKED like climbable dicks
[3:20:16] <otakon17> they do but Jedi do not use them on like PRINCIPLE
[3:20:22] <otakon17> he just beat the other planet
[3:20:31] <otakon17> well "did the story section"
[3:20:33] <ScreamLord> He went to and finished the other planet
[3:20:33] <AnacondaVirtue> Went to the other available planet. Many angry goats there
[3:20:36] <otakon17> the first one the Zeffo go on
[3:20:39] <otakon17> oh the goats
[3:20:42] <otakon17> SO ANGRY
[3:20:45] <derap41> He said you hated fun and when I jumped over to your stream you where comlaining saying you hate it
[3:20:47] <%MarkSoupial> luke definitely used guns
[3:20:52] <otakon17> lol
[3:20:52] <%JJCheeker> JJCheeker subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! the force is eh with this one..... bitterShrug
[3:20:53] <mostundesired> Is it only when it dies?
[3:20:55] <AnacondaVirtue> I mean that's most foul-smelling insects, Plague. Nature's a bitch
[3:20:56] <SuperVaderMan> Fuck that guy for killing me DansGame
[3:20:58] <stranger59> Yes, that's what I'd want to be, if I could.
[3:21:00] <otakon17> Luke used guns BEFORE he went jEdi
[3:21:04] <Triblade1992> that's a plague of gripes approved of enemy
[3:21:04] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the jedi will pull a batman and loath guns UNLESS they are attached to some sort of automobile
[3:21:04] <ahegotrigger> that would be cool
[3:21:09] <otakon17> I think just death
[3:21:12] <%MarkSoupial> yeah, like, jabbas palace
[3:21:13] <ziggyjesus> Wouldn't regular bullets be super good in the starwars universe? They can't be blocked or reflected and have a way faster velocity than laser blasters
[3:21:14] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it might work for a colony based organism
[3:21:27] <AnacondaVirtue> 0/10 star
[3:21:28] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> kill the thing that killed you to protect the colony
[3:21:33] <ScreamLord> I mean, I'D want to leave a puddle of Fuck You behind if someone killed me
[3:21:38] <ziggyjesus> Looks like the DS3 dark sign sun
[3:21:38] <SuperVaderMan> Dathomir sucks, and everything is angry all the time
[3:21:39] <otakon17> @ziggyjesus I think kinetic weapons wouldn't have the force to go through conventional body armor of the time
[3:21:40] <Partrap> tons of real species do that, besides more apt examples, that's basically the fundamental principle behind poisonous plants
[3:21:54] <otakon17> Thoese are scratches pretty sure
[3:21:55] <Triblade1992> Be glad we don't have to deal with twin suns
[3:22:06] <%JJCheeker> Is this the planet that gets blown up in rogue one?
[3:22:11] <ninetales8491> looks like a open egg
[3:22:12] <Triblade1992> no
[3:22:26] <$SWFanatic> Spider can kill Jedi with this one simple trick
[3:22:33] <%MarkSoupial> Aldathraan
[3:22:36] <Triblade1992> 5 planets that are just new republic
[3:22:37] <otakon17> The Death Star blew up ONE planet and now EVERY movie has to one up it
[3:22:44] <otakon17> we need to blow up THREE planets
[3:22:45] <otakon17> TEN
[3:22:51] <otakon17> A HUNDRED
[3:22:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> don't forget to eat the sun to kill a solar system
[3:23:03] <otakon17> The Suneater
[3:23:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Who blows more planets? Disney star wars movies or any of the JJ Abrahms Star Trek movies?
[3:23:08] <otakon17> that was actually a neat concept
[3:23:09] <Triblade1992> Well that was the OT with two death stars
[3:23:15] <otakon17> but I don't think they did that in the movies
[3:23:17] <otakon17> did they?
[3:23:19] <otakon17> XD
[3:23:23] <derap41> The prequels at least tried something else they fucked it up royaly but they tried
[3:23:26] <%JJCheeker> For the most part the world building in the sequals has been bad
[3:23:27] <%MarkSoupial> remember S T A R W A R S????
[3:23:28] <+joekuta71> do it
[3:23:29] <Triblade1992> Starkiller Base only existted in one movie
[3:23:30] <+TheSaintJohn> but if we can't keep recycling the same plot how will we keep making money?
[3:23:33] <AnacondaVirtue> Also this isn't so much a sequel thing as it is a prequel thing. But I hate the obsession with "Balance" that George had.
[3:23:36] <otakon17> YOU CAN BLOCK ACID?!
[3:23:43] <$SWFanatic> oh you're in blighttown
[3:23:44] <$SWFanatic> i get it
[3:23:45] <otakon17> I guess it vaporizes on hitting the blade
[3:23:47] <otakon17> YES
[3:23:49] <+Draylle> its using the force :)
[3:23:49] <Ekaelis> The scale of Starkiller base reminds me of 40k more than Star Wars
[3:23:50] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the prequels tried to convice us taht we didn't want any death sticks
[3:23:50] <SuperVaderMan> blocking balls of acid LUL
[3:23:52] <otakon17> this is the B lighttown of the game
[3:23:52] <stranger59> THE FORCE
[3:23:56] <Torivore> Space magic
[3:23:58] <Samex_Comex> Block the rain
[3:24:09] <ziggyjesus> Its one of those attacks you wouldn't guess to block, like the big frog biting you
[3:24:11] <ScreamLord> Reflect that water right back into the bucket LUL
[3:24:32] <otakon17> "I have no survival skills!"
[3:24:32] <Torivore> Zoner enemies
[3:24:36] <otakon17> I HATE that thinking
[3:24:43] <otakon17> I hate that A.I. programming
[3:24:52] <otakon17> WALL RUN
[3:25:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I hate sand, it's crass and gets everywhere
[3:25:04] <otakon17> acid pools
[3:25:17] <derap41> Like and angry wet fart
[3:25:21] <%MarkSoupial> ancient jedi wallrun runes
[3:25:21] <otakon17> lol
[3:25:28] <otakon17> "Angry wet fart"
[3:25:35] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Obi Wan hid Luke on Tatooine because he knew Vader hated sand.
[3:25:40] <Torivore> Spite acid. Spacid
[3:25:47] <otakon17> to the dick wall!
[3:25:48] <sadolerlaqreet1> I wish this was a real rpg like the star wars game on the first xbox
[3:26:00] <derap41> Did he make a campfire
[3:26:03] <derap41> ?
[3:26:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Vader with his breathing machines know the danger of sand getting everywhere
[3:26:15] <otakon17> that spider was just trying to roast some mashmallows!
[3:26:16] <ScreamLord> It makes NO sense that your saber emits more like just from you holding it up
[3:26:20] <$SWFanatic> mmmm me
[3:26:20] <%MarkSoupial> i like how vader didn't realize they were in orbit over tatooine at some point
[3:26:28] <stranger59> This is all true
[3:26:28] <derap41> Whatever gets you off plague
[3:26:29] <Samex_Comex> Killed any cool aliens so far?
[3:26:30] <mostundesired> Can't even be mad, this is what I signed up for.
[3:26:31] <otakon17> I think it's more, you're holding it up to your eyes so you can see better
[3:26:51] <ahegotrigger> no need to appologize its true
[3:26:57] <otakon17> dem spiderboys, you're invading
[3:27:00] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the dark force and the helmet clouded his vision of Tatooine
[3:27:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how does a lightsaber block acid spit?
[3:27:21] <%MarkSoupial> yeah it clouded a lot of his memories from the prequels
[3:27:27] <derap41> Like these are actually sentient being and you're genociding them
[3:27:28] <+TheNitroMonkey> this game looks very easy
[3:27:30] <%MarkSoupial> where can i get that helmet
[3:27:43] <otakon17> "Father NO!" "Son avoid my acid pool when I die!"
[3:27:58] <otakon17> damn man THREE points
[3:27:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It clouded that one time when he jumped in a space car traffic
[3:28:02] <%MarkSoupial> Human Effigy??
[3:28:03] <otakon17> you rolling in upgrades
[3:28:25] <+DukeMoose> oh no, plagues oc jedi is one of those lame AgriCorp jedi
[3:28:31] <otakon17> It's your Poise
[3:28:33] <otakon17> like Sekiro
[3:28:37] <SuperVaderMan> The dathomir witches ARE basically amazons, so maybe.
[3:28:55] <Triblade1992> I thought they were suppose to be Salem witches
[3:29:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> did Eli solve his deadly spider problem yet?
[3:29:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> so they are amazon hotties?
[3:29:19] <artificiallynatural> I mean they dom the nightbrothers hard so it can be a little both
[3:29:25] <+DukeMoose> @morcego_cinzento_arts soya like bald and skeletony?
[3:29:59] <derap41> Aight I'd fuck it
[3:30:15] <SuperVaderMan> Are they Force-teleporting in, what the
[3:30:22] <otakon17> oh shit Dathomir Witches
[3:30:35] <otakon17> more like they've been juiced up
[3:30:37] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> is fel magic a thing in star wars?
[3:30:41] <AncelDeLambert> this guy really is an idiot, isn't he?
[3:30:43] <otakon17> she buffed them
[3:30:44] <Triblade1992> buff
[3:30:46] <Cyral_Drive> boof
[3:30:49] <stranger59> Force Buff
[3:30:52] <derap41> This she possessed them
[3:30:57] <AncelDeLambert> "I don't mean you any harm!" *draws lightsaber*
[3:31:03] <otakon17> don't let their poise regen Plague!
[3:31:07] <%MarkSoupial> wait do they have shields??
[3:31:11] <SuperVaderMan> "I'll harm you!"
[3:31:18] <otakon17> no they have Poise like you do
[3:31:26] <Triblade1992> at least say "come here!"
[3:31:28] <+pwnjones> "Suck my horns!" What?
[3:31:31] <Cyral_Drive> I will attack you with my weapon until you die
[3:31:32] <+TheSaintJohn> "I will destroy you" - every Mass Effect enemy
[3:31:35] <morcego_cinzento_arts> DukeMoose so not amazonians at all? Damn here goes something that could had redemed star wars
[3:31:38] <otakon17> now heal?
[3:31:46] <rsg220> ENEMIES EVERYWHERE
[3:31:53] <AncelDeLambert> the dialogue in this game is horrendous, yes
[3:31:57] <Cyral_Drive> LOST SHIELDS
[3:32:01] <%MarkSoupial> s t r i k e h i m mphDerp
[3:32:02] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> some stormtroopers say funny lines if they land a hit
[3:32:03] <stranger59> "Wounds... my only weakness!"
[3:32:05] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[3:32:11] <otakon17> man this game desperately needs some extra consumables or another upgrade tree for your equipment
[3:32:12] <derap41> TEAR YOU APPART
[3:32:27] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, upgrading just the cosmetics of your gear is weaksauce
[3:32:28] <$SWFanatic> Cheer50 Let the Hate flow through you
[3:32:29] <otakon17> like some better armor
[3:32:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "They must be death by now. Destroy what's left of them" -- Darth Sidius
[3:32:31] <+DukeMoose> plz I'm here to help, while I smash your priceless artifacts
[3:32:36] <morcego_cinzento_arts> be dea*
[3:32:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> dead*
[3:32:42] <+pwnjones> Amazing
[3:32:52] <otakon17> @AncelDeLambert agreed I mean it's a nice touch but gimme seome better ranged defense or something
[3:32:54] <%MarkSoupial> they spent more on the physics for that rope than i will make in my lifetime
[3:32:57] <ziggyjesus> I do like that for humanoid enemies, they still die in 1 or 2 hits, but their stamina bar acts as a shield
[3:33:08] <stranger59> Sound made of tired.
[3:33:08] <otakon17> I would suggest Life Up and Block
[3:33:09] <AnacondaVirtue> Just make the hate in your veins more concentrated than the rest of your hate
[3:33:15] <otakon17> yeah
[3:33:20] <otakon17> I saw Pat do the Force side
[3:33:22] <SWFanatic> more unlock in a little bit
[3:33:30] <AncelDeLambert> aaaaah, force leap, thank you game
[3:33:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @morcego_cinzento_arts that wasNute Gunray
[3:33:40] <+pwnjones> What's the best snack to order from amazon, I'm in the mood for cookies and I'm diabetic so it has to be worth dying for
[3:33:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> i think
[3:34:00] <otakon17> @pwnjones go to the grocery store and get some oreos and milk
[3:34:02] <AncelDeLambert> whatever ratings board made it so you can't cut humans in half: fuck you
[3:34:19] <otakon17> well they did it so their sales wouldn't be limited probably
[3:34:28] <AnacondaVirtue> Looks like mostly stamina damage
[3:34:31] <otakon17> that kick seems to be a stamina drain
[3:34:39] <+pwnjones> Oreos are 21 carbs for 2 cookies
[3:34:40] <otakon17> I still say Block and Life Up
[3:34:41] <AncelDeLambert> or you won't think to use it because the regular dodge functions
[3:34:53] <ScreamLord> Pat got that so it must be useless somehow LUL
[3:34:57] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> do T games sell less than M games these days?
[3:35:02] <otakon17> I say Block
[3:35:07] <otakon17> Block will help
[3:35:08] <SWFanatic> block
[3:35:09] <Cyral_Drive> mo block
[3:35:14] <AncelDeLambert> do you have the cowabunga ninja run?
[3:35:16] <Torivore> Better block
[3:35:25] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Yeah now that you mentined i don't quite remember if it was the hologram of Sidius or Gunray. i think it makes more sense taht it was Gunray now that you mentioned it
[3:35:30] <otakon17> also the PARRY MONSTER
[3:35:43] <otakon17> Parry Monster must be parried
[3:35:55] <otakon17> so the rules fo the game is VERY aggressive anemies tend to be blockable
[3:36:00] <AncelDeLambert> Parry Monster energy drink, give Norman Reedus none
[3:36:11] <%MarkSoupial> yeah, just know ahead of time that you have to parry 6 attacks in a row
[3:36:13] <AncelDeLambert> thank you, camera, not fuckey at all
[3:36:19] <otakon17> damn those laser crossbows are FAST
[3:36:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> is that a fucking bow with a light string?
[3:36:37] <otakon17> Plague you know you can parry bolts?
[3:36:41] <ScreamLord> Laser...bows?
[3:36:50] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> are they using the force here? because it looks pretty weird
[3:36:51] <otakon17> Chewbacca had a Boltcaster
[3:36:57] <otakon17> which was the equivalent of a laser crossbow
[3:37:01] <derap41> This place does look like the Mortal Kombat world
[3:37:04] <otakon17> GRIND TIME
[3:37:08] <+pwnjones> Should make a knifecaster
[3:37:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @derap41 so basically Outworld in Star Wars? yeah i can see that
[3:37:38] <otakon17> okay the cahrge attack does NOT seem to be parriable
[3:37:46] <otakon17> THERE we go
[3:37:54] <otakon17> and that looks like DEATH
[3:38:01] <Huntercd> Is that Sith lady hot?
[3:38:13] <%JJCheeker> I kinda don't like him talking while fighting. They should have given an option to turn it off
[3:38:15] <%MarkSoupial> Dark Souls Tooie
[3:38:18] <Maids4lyfe> she's sith so by default she's gonna be hot
[3:38:31] <BigBanterCorbin> COME....... fight me
[3:38:35] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> >tfw no sith mommy gf
[3:38:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Huntercd, i do recommend googling Darth Talon
[3:38:46] <AnacondaVirtue> The DS2 "depletion" system wouldn't be so bad if so much gear didn't drop exclusively from enemies
[3:39:07] <Triblade1992> WOW, ragdoll
[3:39:11] <%MarkSoupial> wat u mean, just make the game HARDER and u can farm more
[3:39:26] <%MarkSoupial> definitely a good mechanic
[3:39:28] <%JJCheeker> I do like the orange light saber
[3:39:46] <Huntercd> Are there tw'leks or other aliens in this or is it just boring humans?
[3:39:47] <otakon17> Evasive KICKU!
[3:39:48] <Maids4lyfe> I think more skill become available when you unlock new abilities too?
[3:40:08] <otakon17> @Huntercd well we saw Prauf but I'm pretty sure more aliens will show up
[3:40:12] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but why ugly orange?
[3:40:14] <%MarkSoupial> rock that PRIMO orange
[3:40:23] <AncelDeLambert> Guardian colors for life
[3:40:28] <mortelkilll> everyone knwo the purple lightsaber is the only option
[3:40:33] <mortelkilll> or red if yo uwant to be edgy
[3:40:33] <Maids4lyfe> those people are dumb
[3:40:42] <Jrockoni> I like green man
[3:40:43] <mortelkilll> orange isnt bad trough
[3:40:44] <Cyral_Drive> what a hero barging into their home and killing them
[3:40:44] <Triblade1992> blame the prequels for making them dumb
[3:40:47] <AnacondaVirtue> I don't like the good/evil association with colors, but blue is a damn pretty color.
[3:40:48] <AncelDeLambert> fuck purple, purple is for people who get miscast in shit roles
[3:40:48] <+yoshkosh20> I'd go with green just because it's my favorite color.
[3:40:49] <Jrockoni> it's a cool color
[3:40:50] <%JJCheeker> I do like green but orange is better
[3:40:50] <Maids4lyfe> there were jedi with yellow lightsabers in clone wars
[3:40:51] <+TheNitroMonkey> purple if youre a bad ass black man
[3:40:52] <%MarkSoupial> tfw luke's was green because he fucked up when making it
[3:40:55] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> pink master race
[3:40:56] <Samex_Comex> Woah it's a darth maul man!
[3:41:12] <Huntercd> Finally, if only the movies would take lessons and add aliens.
[3:41:21] <mortelkilll> a black or white lightsaber would be cool
[3:41:27] <ahegotrigger> that sounds cool
[3:41:40] <%MarkSoupial> did lady take the time to go around slowly buffing everyone?
[3:41:41] <AncelDeLambert> what happens when you force push someone who's glowing red?
[3:41:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> there was that one cool dark lightsaber with an bigger handle that emitted a longer beam that was used by a weird secret society of mandalorians that had a sexual thrill on killing Jedi
[3:41:44] <Samex_Comex> Ginger saber
[3:41:47] <mortelkilll> aliens are cool, even when they are just humans with weird heads and skin
[3:41:52] <ahegotrigger> I wanna see Batman fight Luke Skywalker with his red saber
[3:41:59] <%MarkSoupial> i mean
[3:42:02] <BigBanterCorbin> killed his brother PepeHands
[3:42:03] <SWFanatic> oh look at this dark souls hall
[3:42:24] <Triblade1992> WOW
[3:42:24] <SWFanatic> pffff
[3:42:26] <AncelDeLambert> FUCK THIS
[3:42:26] <mostundesired> LUL
[3:42:30] <SuperVaderMan> Extremely Dark Souls LUL
[3:42:30] <Snirtax> Oh hello there
[3:42:31] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[3:42:31] <%MarkSoupial> get predicted, idiot
[3:42:31] <mortelkilll> we knwo your tricks game
[3:42:32] <SWFanatic> he just watched his brother die
[3:42:34] <Triblade1992> LUL
[3:42:37] <Solokaldaka> stripNani
[3:42:38] <vonmaultke> bitterLurk
[3:42:47] <+yoshkosh20> those crafty bastards.
[3:43:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> you guys weren't joking
[3:43:10] <mortelkilll> yeah its a bit annoying that games rarely have a mechanic to surprise foes
[3:43:14] <Samex_Comex> You can do it orange maul
[3:43:18] <Triblade1992> What should have happened is thatt you turned the corner, he's not there and then when you walk over there he dropped down from above
[3:43:27] <SuperVaderMan> He distracts his opponents by making them feel bad. Just "Hey you wanna stop fighting and talk about it?"
[3:43:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> one of the gendy Star War clone wars cartoons had Mace windu fighting bare handed with the force just smashing droids with the force on his fists.....why don't we have that here?
[3:43:39] <AncelDeLambert> good job, robot, thank you for the USELESS COSMETICS
[3:43:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> if only you had a gun right now...
[3:44:03] <+yoshkosh20> they know
[3:44:15] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but those are uncivilized
[3:44:16] <Huntercd> @morcego_cinzento_arts That would require thinking outside of box
[3:44:17] <%JJCheeker> He was standing waiting by that corner for 20 years
[3:44:36] <mortelkilll> i wonder if there gun-lightsabers
[3:44:37] <AncelDeLambert> if only there were a lightsaber that had a range further than arms reach. Perhaps one that could be shot... perhaps with a trigger of some form!
[3:44:55] <Prism_Wing> HeyGuys Hi Plague!
[3:44:57] <+yoshkosh20> is force jumping athing?
[3:44:58] <SWFanatic> how uncivilized
[3:45:01] <Huntercd> Just use the force to curve lasers
[3:45:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @mortelkilll a gun that shoots lightsabers? sign me up!
[3:45:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Huntercd Damn it you're right.... Also google Darth Talon. hottest sith twi'lek ever
[3:45:19] <Maids4lyfe> force paintings
[3:45:24] <Prism_Wing> They just like to drawr, damn Kappa
[3:45:24] <%MarkSoupial> high jump boots
[3:45:40] <SWFanatic> he nervous
[3:45:50] <%MarkSoupial> HE SHAKES WITH FEAR
[3:45:51] <Triblade1992> look at the spder
[3:45:53] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> alright Plague, you gotta stealth this section
[3:46:02] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> nvm
[3:46:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @mortelkilll they should make an automatic assault blaster with a light saber bayonet
[3:46:14] <%JJCheeker> A gun that shoots lightsabers? That is some expensive ammo
[3:46:24] <+pwnjones> You killed his future legs!
[3:46:35] <mortelkilll> what about a lightsaber tha tshoot guns?
[3:46:37] <Prism_Wing> So is this Star Souls?
[3:46:41] <%MarkSoupial> mphPolice mphBadge
[3:46:44] <%MarkSoupial> illegal joke
[3:46:51] <Samex_Comex> Heavy
[3:47:16] <AncelDeLambert> this is Star Souls: Shadow of Raider
[3:47:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @mortelkilll that would end all wars and bring piece to Star Wars
[3:47:22] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> peaceful heroic jedi kills local tribal and wildlife
[3:47:22] <Triblade1992> well he did was his favorite pat
[3:47:32] <mostundesired> Maybe he really thought of the spider as a brother. D:
[3:47:41] <mortelkilll> dont judge this guy parent for treatign the spider as their son
[3:47:48] <Triblade1992> it's like a doggo for Dathimir
[3:47:52] <%MarkSoupial> the camera had to move so it could move
[3:47:53] <Frog_of_Justic> They are all Hulk Hogan fans. Right on brother
[3:48:00] <Prism_Wing> Dat Lego hair
[3:48:00] <Solokaldaka> upgrades!
[3:48:06] <%MarkSoupial> oh no
[3:48:11] <Triblade1992> twin lightsaber
[3:48:13] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> ew gros
[3:48:14] <%MarkSoupial> darth maul made a darth maul thing
[3:48:14] <mortelkilll> we darth mauling boys
[3:48:15] <AncelDeLambert> SIIIIIIIGGHHHHHH
[3:48:25] <Samex_Comex> Ew what kind of alien are you?
[3:48:29] <BigBanterCorbin> the jedi doesn't even give his victims a proper burial FeelsBadMan complete sociopath FeelsBadMan
[3:48:31] <Triblade1992> I think it was the second part you got
[3:48:32] <somelurker> gods no
[3:48:35] <+DukeMoose> savage oppress
[3:48:35] <Torivore> Well that came out of nowhere
[3:48:38] <jiin6> instantly knows the styles
[3:48:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes replace double blade and get a shield instead
[3:48:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh fuck me. Of course we get Darth Maul's ldouble light saber upgrade in his birthplace planet
[3:48:50] <SuperVaderMan> Build that double lightsaber with those advanced cave materials
[3:48:52] <AncelDeLambert> literally double sided sabers only exist because the guy who played Darth Maul wanted to show of his staff skills
[3:48:55] <ziggyjesus> Wouldn't you need special training for 2 bladed lightsabers to not bisect yourself?
[3:49:01] <%JJCheeker> I thought it excelled at cutting off your limbs by accident
[3:49:02] <mortelkilll> to be honest, i never found star wars that interesting of a setting
[3:49:16] <%MarkSoupial> guns bad, but CROWD CONTROL LIGHTSABER is no problem
[3:49:30] <LordPubious> you're probably better off just activating one blade for the benefit of the longer hilt
[3:49:36] <Huntercd> I keep getting a Red Twi'lek with black tattoos and black panties. Darth Talon is popular
[3:49:53] <jiin6> corrosion
[3:49:54] <Triblade1992> that's why i like the Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren blade. ACTUAL USEFUL CROSSGUARD
[3:50:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the only way i can see a double light saber being practical would be if it was more of a polearm with laser spear heads on each end. way less ways of cutting yourself
[3:50:11] <mortelkilll> a crossguard isnt that useful if its made of lazer
[3:50:15] <%MarkSoupial> remember when the crossgaurd was a big complaint?
[3:50:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Triblade1992 but he only uses it once
[3:50:20] <%MarkSoupial> how naive people were
[3:50:36] <%MarkSoupial> WHATTR YA BUYIN
[3:50:40] <jiin6> oh god its a Flasher
[3:50:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> oh god it's Zeus in disguise
[3:50:45] <LordPubious> is that Ewan McGregor?
[3:50:53] <mortelkilll> hes totally the big bad
[3:50:55] <ziggyjesus> Creepy old man pervs on teen nightsisters
[3:50:55] <AncelDeLambert> this guy better turn out to be a Sith
[3:50:56] <Triblade1992> @mortelkilll @ThatOneGuyYouSaw it is when you are constantly blocking from getting your arm cut
[3:51:01] <%JJCheeker> Stranger I've got some good things on sale
[3:51:04] <Huntercd> The guard only works if Kylo is stronger than his opponent
[3:51:07] <Jrockoni> STARWARS PATCHES
[3:51:12] <Prism_Wing> There should be a lightsaber that's just a ball that expands and blows everyone up.
[3:51:18] <jiin6> is that troy baker?
[3:51:21] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Huntercd well you did wanted too find hot fem Sith lords. here is the most popular example
[3:51:26] <mortelkilll> a lightwhip or a lightflail would be cool
[3:51:39] <%MarkSoupial> this guy is here for when force exposition seems implausible
[3:51:50] <Solokaldaka> D:
[3:51:54] <%MarkSoupial> like we have already established magic backstory power
[3:51:57] <jiin6> totally legit flasher
[3:51:57] <Maids4lyfe> no totally trustworthy
[3:51:58] <mortelkilll> i wish lightsaber went trough each others and couldnt block or be blocked
[3:52:04] <BigBanterCorbin> yeah, kind old man
[3:52:06] <SonofStranger> he reminds me of al-mualim from AC1
[3:52:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Triblade1992 but the blades don't protect the handle
[3:52:09] <+yoshkosh20> I'd trust him with my life
[3:52:10] <somelurker> just a innocent bystander, ignore hin
[3:52:11] <Prism_Wing> How about a lightnuke? 4Head
[3:52:11] <Torivore> Naw he's on the up and up
[3:52:12] <Triblade1992> hey, don't be dissing the red hair. Mara Jade is also a red head and she is best girl
[3:52:13] <Samex_Comex> He wears a friendly cloak
[3:52:15] <Frog_of_Justic> He has trustworthy eyes
[3:52:19] <Maids4lyfe> why that would be dumb if lightsabers passed through each other
[3:52:24] <Maids4lyfe> they're not lasers
[3:52:29] <Huntercd> I just wanted hot aliens or aliens in general @morcego_cinzento_arts
[3:52:42] <%JJCheeker> I sure hope that guys wearing underwear under there
[3:52:45] <mortelkilll> they should be
[3:52:54] <Triblade1992> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Episode 3 proved that there needs to be a crossguard for these things given how many times their arms got cut off
[3:53:02] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @Huntercd a man of culture like myself
[3:53:14] <Snirtax> Man, that sure is a trustworthy black cloak he's got. That's the trustworthy color in this universe
[3:53:39] <Samex_Comex> Oooh trying to get that space booty
[3:53:56] <Huntercd> Why hasn't there been an anime set in the Star War?
[3:54:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Star Wars, where the line between sexual creepo in hobbes and mysterious important side character blurr a lot
[3:54:11] <mortelkilll> i am torn between my desire for booty and aliens that arent just palette swapped humans
[3:54:13] <Prism_Wing> Ok, hear me out. A jeep with like 50 lightsabers trapped to it so you can just mow down all the droids and clones in the world.
[3:54:40] <mortelkilll> just make lightduders
[3:54:40] <%MarkSoupial> every area is new if your memory is bad
[3:54:46] <Triblade1992> @Prism_Wing I'll take "what is Dead Rising 3 for 500"
[3:54:49] <mortelkilll> just dudes made of lightsaber stuff
[3:55:00] <mortelkilll> and they run troug henenmies to kill them
[3:55:12] <Huntercd> Wasn't that Grievious? @mortelkilll
[3:55:30] <Prism_Wing> @mortelkilll Like the spikey regenerators in RE4 LUL
[3:55:31] <mortelkilll> while grievious was cool he wasnt a giant lazer dude
[3:55:38] <%MarkSoupial> platform that emits a lightsaber sphere, use the force while stanting on platform to move
[3:55:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @mortelkilll you can kinda get that with female predators or maybe quarians
[3:55:47] <swigartz1193> Did you go to Dathomir first?
[3:55:49] <Prism_Wing> @triblade1992 What IS Dead Rising 3? 🤔
[3:55:52] <otakon17> FUCKING
[3:55:54] <otakon17> KNEW IT
[3:55:54] <Triblade1992> a gaem
[3:55:57] <jiin6> he a spooked good
[3:56:10] <otakon17> THE DOUBLE SABER
[3:56:21] <Samex_Comex> Spin like a top
[3:56:27] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Triblade1992 I don't think we ever see a motion where a crossguard would have prevented amputation in a film, just Kylo using it for a cheapshot against Poe.
[3:56:28] <mortelkilll> by palette swapped humans i mean anything thats basiquelly the same shape and proportions, changing the head does not count
[3:56:38] <Solokaldaka> maybe it;s not used with a 2 sided?
[3:56:38] <otakon17> we theorized this from the lightsaber customaization table
[3:56:48] <morcego_cinzento_arts> they should make an kata light saber. kata is like an ancient India push dagger thingie
[3:56:48] <kiwiredgrave> How far along in the game is he?
[3:57:00] <Huntercd> Why not just use two sword instead of this awkward thing?
[3:57:00] <ziggyjesus> like 2 or 3 hours
[3:57:03] <otakon17> this is technically the third planet I guess?
[3:57:05] <otakon17> HEAL
[3:57:05] <kiwiredgrave> Aight
[3:57:11] <%MarkSoupial> !uptime
[3:57:11] <@Nightbot> 3 hours 57 minutes 22 seconds
[3:57:12] <LordSDB> How are they parring a lightsaber?
[3:57:13] <+yoshkosh20> that's matt mercer. the deep voice
[3:57:20] <otakon17> magic bullshit weapons
[3:57:29] <Triblade1992> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw there was the Rey vs Ben Solo fight in episode 7. and usually someone's hand gets cut from that if there was no crossguard
[3:57:57] <%MarkSoupial> lightsabers cut through whatever the plot needs them to
[3:58:01] <brizzi_barks_in_the_chat> they should be able ot cut through wood
[3:58:04] <mortelkilll> i wish they were blades of dooms
[3:58:04] <AncelDeLambert> as always, we can blame the EU and Lucas for that
[3:58:06] <Triblade1992> the problem is how they are just plasma
[3:58:07] <+TheNitroMonkey> @MarkSoupial LMAO
[3:58:14] <Samex_Comex> Is that a fucking sphere grid!?
[3:58:15] <kiwiredgrave> wasn't there an armor in a game thay may or not be cannon now that was lightsaber resistant?
[3:58:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why not just make armor that's immune to lightsabers?
[3:58:35] <+TheNitroMonkey> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw the mandalorians did
[3:58:36] <mortelkilll> imagine just having a weapon made of pure power that goes trough absolutely anythign and cannot be stopped, even by itself and also is weightless
[3:58:37] <AncelDeLambert> something or other weave, yeah
[3:58:41] <Huntercd> Guns works better @ThatOneGuyYouSaw
[3:58:41] <AncelDeLambert> it had a silly name
[3:58:43] <ziggyjesus> cortosis
[3:58:44] <otakon17> they have armor that's lightsaber resistant
[3:58:47] <AncelDeLambert> that's it
[3:58:49] <otakon17> cortosis weave
[3:58:50] <swigartz1193> Mandalorian Iron is lightsaber resistant
[3:58:54] <Solokaldaka> that take 2
[3:58:54] <otakon17> but that's used for eweapons
[3:58:59] <otakon17> it's three points
[3:59:00] <ziggyjesus> 2 skill points
[3:59:00] <Solokaldaka> in the upper left
[3:59:01] <SuperVaderMan> There's like 5 different metals that are lightsaber resistant
[3:59:04] <otakon17> look at the cost
[3:59:08] <Torivore> Needs 2 points
[3:59:12] <mortelkilll> a weapon that goes trough any substance would be a cool concept for sci-fi or fantasy
[3:59:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> a way of making the light saber crossguard thingie less of a hazard. like having the portion of the laser that would be facing your fingers with an solid piece of metal that mask that one side of each laser
[3:59:32] <mortelkilll> or just make an actual crossguard nto lazery
[3:59:34] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why don't more characters make use of it?
[3:59:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> yeah that also would help
[3:59:54] <mortelkilll> there not good reason the crossguard need to be lazer if there materials that can block it
[3:59:55] <%MarkSoupial> i mean
[4:00:11] <%MarkSoupial> there are only like 1 or 19 lightsabers anywhere anymore
[4:00:16] <%MarkSoupial> depending on the story
[4:00:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> you could have an actual solid guard and upper you have the cross section laser for aditional offence
[4:00:29] <%MarkSoupial> that's a pretty specific thing to build a defense for
[4:00:35] <Solokaldaka> is that a collectable high in that arch way with the rope swing?
[4:00:42] <mortelkilll> havign a guard which you can injure yourself one is a bit counter productive
[4:01:10] <AncelDeLambert> no matter which way you cut it, that crossguard saber is dumb as fuck
[4:01:17] <AncelDeLambert> dumb. as. fuck
[4:01:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> "cut it"
[4:01:23] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> heh
[4:01:26] <%MarkSoupial> star wars is pretty dumb overall
[4:01:34] <mortelkilll> ive heard that its just because the crystal kylo ren use is shit
[4:01:40] <mortelkilll> and broken so it makde multiple beams
[4:01:41] <%JJCheeker> I'mma go sleep. Enjoy your Star of Wars Souls and goodnight bitterSweet
[4:01:49] <Prism_Wing> This guy's a real force to be retconned with Kappa
[4:01:55] <morcego_cinzento_arts> sleep well @JJCheeker
[4:02:00] <AncelDeLambert> no excuse to have the beams come out next to your damn hand
[4:02:04] <otakon17> I think the kick only works if you dodge to the left or right
[4:02:08] <AncelDeLambert> but metal in the way so you don't burn yourself, ffs
[4:02:14] <AncelDeLambert> *put
[4:02:17] <Triblade1992> I rather have crossguard lightsaber than the double sided one, or worse the Inquisitor lightsaber.
[4:02:22] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @mortelkilll why can't he just get a better one, or use the one he used to have?
[4:02:31] <mortelkilll> lazyness
[4:02:33] <AncelDeLambert> cuz emo
[4:02:36] <%MarkSoupial> swords in general are pretty shitty
[4:02:40] <kiwiredgrave> there isim pretty sure. Itdoesnt come directly out of the hilt
[4:02:40] <%MarkSoupial> but H O N O R
[4:02:43] <mortelkilll> swords are ok
[4:02:51] <AncelDeLambert> spear is true weapon
[4:02:51] <mortelkilll> not so mcuh with guns around trough
[4:02:56] <mortelkilll> oh right spear
[4:02:56] <AncelDeLambert> swords are inferior spears
[4:02:59] <LordPubious> the more flamboyant it is the better the technique
[4:03:03] <mortelkilll> swords are easier to carry
[4:03:14] <mortelkilll> which is why they were used as self defence tool
[4:03:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> that electric po9le arm that the droid guards of General Grievous use are pretty cool
[4:03:32] <LordSDB> I'm more of a dagger guy
[4:03:41] <morcego_cinzento_arts> polearm*
[4:03:50] <mortelkilll> a gun and a shield maybe would make the most sense
[4:03:53] <%MarkSoupial> "difficult" in that they wanted you to deal a specific way that isn't anywhere else so far
[4:04:02] <%MarkSoupial> oh no WOOD
[4:04:04] <mortelkilll> depending on if they can make shield that block lazers
[4:04:22] <mortelkilll> wonder if there are force guns
[4:04:31] <mortelkilll> that yo ucan manipulate like lightsabers
[4:04:33] <SuperVaderMan> dathomir sucks, time to go home
[4:04:36] <AncelDeLambert> there are storm troopers with machine guns that have shields on them
[4:04:47] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> you could probably manipulate anything with the force
[4:04:48] <Samex_Comex> Oh god what the hell is that!?
[4:05:01] <kiwiredgrave> is the model for this character the guy who played the joker from Gotham?
[4:05:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes pick a better color
[4:05:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> give a jedi a gun and have his telekinesis to form a shield around him...or if you need al the flare, give him a light saber for his off hand to make his locomia dance to deflct all shots
[4:05:11] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> plox
[4:05:13] <%MarkSoupial> apparently there's something called a Lightsaber Rifle
[4:05:30] <%MarkSoupial> "This weapon was a type of rifle designed to work in conjunction with a standard lightsaber. During the first year of the Galactic Empire, Jocasta Nu wielded this rifle against Darth Vader. "
[4:05:52] <AncelDeLambert> ... the EU is fucking awful and I'm glad it was axed
[4:06:08] <AncelDeLambert> 90% of the EU is just fanfiction
[4:06:13] <Triblade1992> I only miss the Thrawn Trilogy, KOTOR and KOTOR 2 in the EU
[4:06:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> like the lancer of Gear of War but instead of a chainsaw it's a laser bean
[4:06:16] <%MarkSoupial> this says it's canon
[4:06:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it's all awful, tho
[4:06:17] <AncelDeLambert> the worst kind of fanfiction, too
[4:06:19] <kiwiredgrave> I think that one is part of the new cannon
[4:06:25] <AncelDeLambert> @Triblade1992 agreed
[4:06:32] <mortelkilll> the main stuff are entertaining stories but the setting not that good
[4:06:43] <mortelkilll> star wars kind of has a shakey fundation
[4:06:49] <%MarkSoupial> "The rifle first appeared in Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 9, a canon comic written by Charles Soule, pencilled by Giuseppe Camuncoli, and released in 2017"
[4:06:56] <%MarkSoupial> C A N O N
[4:07:00] <mortelkilll> but then iys not meant to be super in depth so i should probably just have fun with it
[4:07:01] <%MarkSoupial> lightsaber gun
[4:07:02] <AncelDeLambert> ... FUCK DISNEY
[4:07:03] <Samex_Comex> Poor Pat
[4:07:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> BRILLIANT
[4:07:20] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Hell a jedi/sith can have blasters and light saber with internal triggers that only a force users could activate
[4:07:31] <Triblade1992> Isn't that Marvel though? because Marvel isn't exactly known for good storytelling comic wise
[4:07:36] <Heartless_01> i cant wait to see the inquisitor do that stupid lightsaber helicopter thing
[4:08:04] <mortelkilll> man i care so little about the jedis
[4:08:12] <Triblade1992> she is doing her little radio calls I think
[4:08:13] <mortelkilll> they re really not interestign to me
[4:08:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I guess you don't need a seatbelt when you jump into hyperspace
[4:08:19] <%MarkSoupial> who DOESN'T
[4:08:28] <Prism_Wing> Is that Tom Hanks?
[4:08:34] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> or sit down, for that matter
[4:08:35] <kiwiredgrave> Jedi don't use blasters because they associate them with the darkside since they are primarily an offensive weapon. There was a splinter group of jedi who used blasters, but the council hated their fucking guts
[4:08:37] <jiin6> its not like they need Hyperfuel or ANYTHING
[4:08:38] <Huntercd> Ahsoka? Hot alien girl with two swords?
[4:08:40] <%MarkSoupial> marvel stories vary by writer
[4:08:57] <%MarkSoupial> they go from bad to okay
[4:09:10] <ziggyjesus> @Huntercd Yes, Orange butt cheeks
[4:09:15] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @kiwiredgrave shooting bad, slicing good
[4:09:22] <AncelDeLambert> he has Sonic mouth
[4:09:24] <Triblade1992> that's not a good thing MarkSoupial
[4:09:30] <kiwiredgrave> It's space pat
[4:09:30] <mortelkilll> to be honest the lightsaber not great at non combat things
[4:09:34] <xeros720> big herbivore teeth
[4:09:41] <%MarkSoupial> no, no it's not a good thing
[4:09:43] <mortelkilll> the disney new stuff mostly really boring
[4:09:59] <Huntercd> Why does dude have a stupid haircut?
[4:10:07] <mortelkilll> dont feel liek it progressed anythign i nan interestign way
[4:10:08] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @kiwiredgrave so an blaster is an offensive weapon but a oversized laser cutter that dismember people is not? Man i feel more simpathy for this splinter group of jedi's that use blasters
[4:10:09] <Triblade1992> It's because they don't want to go crazy like the old EU did
[4:10:31] <mortelkilll> honestly the argument would only work if the lightsaber had other uses than combat
[4:10:32] <Manjove> Momin
[4:10:34] <+DukeMoose> I think by now there's more concerted dark adepts than jedi in hiding, but the jedi are trained and adepts are just kidnapped younglings
[4:10:43] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why don't the jedi just use shields?
[4:10:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> just an army of space captain americas
[4:10:58] <otakon17> they don't need them
[4:11:02] <%MarkSoupial> nobody was refered to as a sith lord for a while
[4:11:07] <%MarkSoupial> except in the original script
[4:11:12] <%MarkSoupial> THANKS GEORGE
[4:11:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> because defense > offense
[4:11:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i suppose one could use a light saber to cut in the fat of an dead alien mount to save someone from the could....But that is still an stupid reason to not use blasters
[4:11:36] <kotzer71> basicly worshiping the dark side
[4:11:37] <mortelkilll> the jedi/sith divide not really well explored i nthe main movies frankly
[4:11:42] <kiwiredgrave> The best thing that Disney EVER did for the cannon was giving darth vader a sick as black castle on the edge of a lava fall on the planet he was burned alive. That's some DARK SIDE SHIT
[4:11:44] <Triblade1992> sounds kinda like Jorus C'Boath in the old EU who wanted to make a Jedi Council based around the Dark side
[4:11:52] <kiwiredgrave> It's space pat @PlagueOfGripes
[4:11:55] <%MarkSoupial> wait, is this where we're SUPPOSED to learn the name of the ship?
[4:11:55] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:11:56] <Huntercd> So a lot cooler than the movies? @PlagueOfGripes
[4:12:08] <%MarkSoupial> so much of this game has happend in backwards order
[4:12:25] <mortelkilll> thats messed up
[4:12:25] <LordPubious> did that guy grow sideburns or is that just what all of his species look like, woman and man
[4:12:28] <jiin6> nice
[4:12:41] <AncelDeLambert> god that's dumb
[4:12:44] <%MarkSoupial> now THAT'S a fuckin sith
[4:12:51] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but if they're stuck in time, how would they still feel it?
[4:12:52] <ziggyjesus> So a biological dark side power generator
[4:12:55] <AncelDeLambert> oh god that's even dumber
[4:13:05] <+croxeye> It's liquid snake's arm again lol
[4:13:09] <AncelDeLambert> so a Dark Side Fayth, gotcha
[4:13:12] <jiin6> he Rian jonsons the body
[4:13:16] <kiwiredgrave> Is this sith lord by chance, Danny Phantom?
[4:13:18] <somelurker> so hes bootleg Darth Nihlus
[4:13:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> it's like Dark Horse's the Mask
[4:13:46] <ahegotrigger> that sounds rad
[4:13:52] <%MarkSoupial> jedi obsessed?
[4:13:54] <AncelDeLambert> "Jedi Obsessed Weaklings" bitch they beat you
[4:14:04] <%MarkSoupial> i like how in-canon, palpatine uses a lightsaber as a joke
[4:14:05] <+croxeye> don't you have a lightsaber tho?
[4:14:09] <jiin6> but have you found the jedi bricks?
[4:14:10] <+croxeye> or is it a training saber?
[4:14:10] <FairOnFire> sounds metal as hell
[4:14:15] <mortelkilll> yeah but hes not wrong that the sith focus way too much o nthe jedi to do anything of worth
[4:14:20] <%MarkSoupial> like LUL jedi are so lame imma beat them with their own shit
[4:14:22] <Triblade1992> I get why the rule of 2 happened because of the whole "too many cooks in the kitchen" thought process. However it got all muddied up
[4:15:01] <mortelkilll> sith also work poorly in groups
[4:15:08] <%MarkSoupial> when do you unlock the metal gear from Snatcher?
[4:15:11] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why don't the sith ever make their own new dark side faction, with blackjack and hookers?
[4:15:20] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> *sith members
[4:15:24] <Triblade1992> Exactly. Too many and then you have Darth Krayt's NONSENSE of Rule of One.
[4:15:26] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Palpatine was the best. he's fucking evil and he loves it. You outta respect that
[4:15:29] <+m3chamike> The rule of 2 isn’t even followed in the new canon because of the fucking goddamn sith inquisitorS
[4:15:42] <otakon17> they're the equivalent of padawans
[4:15:46] <Huntercd> In SWOTOR there are groups of Sith
[4:15:50] <%MarkSoupial> oh no
[4:15:54] <+m3chamike> And fuck you with the “but they’re not sith”
[4:15:56] <%MarkSoupial> so about the lightsaber gun
[4:16:00] <%MarkSoupial> you load it
[4:16:06] <%MarkSoupial> by just cramming a lightsaber into it
[4:16:15] <otakon17> dem ratty boys
[4:16:18] <Triblade1992> They are dark jedi. Which was a concept introduced with Jorus C'Boath in Thrawn trilogy
[4:16:22] <+DukeMoose> @m3chamike it wasn't followed in the old canon because of the dark adepts and Inquisitors
[4:16:22] <mortelkilll> just saying that the siths by principles dont work well in groups, not that they cant
[4:16:35] <%MarkSoupial> "The weapon could fire at least five shots before the lightsaber being used as fuel melted beyond usage"
[4:16:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> they inevnted the rule of 2 cause way too many sith turns into an edge lord, force induced sexual orgy
[4:16:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @morcego_cinzento_arts hawt
[4:16:59] <Frog_of_Justic> There are lots of devotees but only ever two true sith when the rule is enforced.
[4:17:06] <mortelkilll> thats interesting
[4:17:07] <+DukeMoose> hell Palapatine had an apprentice (maul) while he was still an apprentice to the immortal guy
[4:17:16] <%MarkSoupial> no wonder obiwan hated guns, the jedi were real bad at designing them
[4:17:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but the jedi without the sith become weak and complacent
[4:17:33] <+m3chamike> In the old canon the inquisitors could only feel the force and resist some force powers, but they couldn’t use lightsabers or use offensive force powers
[4:17:34] <Triblade1992> Plaugeis was someone that Palps needed to kill
[4:17:58] <mortelkilll> is plageuis supposed to be evil?
[4:18:01] <+MalekDracarus> Its part of the reason the got tohe rule of two thing going
[4:18:08] <Frog_of_Justic> You need salt and pepper to make a good meal same can be said of the force. Why not learn how to shoot lightning and heal at the same time?
[4:18:09] <mortelkilll> he just sounded liek a dude that used the dark side to keep people alive to me
[4:18:12] <+DukeMoose> zeppo depot
[4:18:19] <kotzer71> basicly both sides quit serving there light /dark side for political power to stop the other side
[4:18:20] <%MarkSoupial> that's the tragedy
[4:18:45] <mortelkilll> i do liek the idea of darth plageuis not wanting power for himself but still beign a sith
[4:18:45] <Samex_Comex> I like Plague of gripes too
[4:18:58] <%MarkSoupial> so anakin but smart
[4:19:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Jedi Council: "We know what we'll do to prevent future sith lords...we shall snatch force sensitive children. Teach then that love and fear are wrong and you will become a genocidal monster if you feel those. And we will also drill into their heads taht all that matters is this ability we have of move shit with our minds. That will never back fire and create moe siths!"
[4:19:37] <%MarkSoupial> yup
[4:19:45] <mortelkilll> i feel like dark and light side probably arent inherently good or evil
[4:19:47] <jiin6> "force masterbation is a sin"
[4:19:49] <Triblade1992> I wouldn't be surprised if Plagueis made his "Force Life Manipulation" just so he could try to live forever. Palps wasn't having any of that crap
[4:19:51] <+DukeMoose> @m3chamike what're you on about? the old canon the Inquisitors were mostly former jedi knights converted to the empire, defected a look ready to palp, or broken into serving
[4:20:11] <+MalekDracarus> i havent gone through any of the books but the vader comics are pretty good so far
[4:20:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> light side is supposed to be you being selfless and being a slave to the force, dark side is being selfish and bending the force to your own will
[4:20:39] <Snirtax> Honestly the whole thing about the force mentally pulling you towards its extremes makes the canon very uninteresting for me. Forces everyone to eventually turn into either a monk or a genocidal maniac
[4:20:54] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw they can be pretty kinky like that
[4:20:58] <mortelkilll> they both end up as horrible people honestly
[4:21:02] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> neither is inherently good or evil, but dark side usually leads heavily into evil over time
[4:21:12] <mortelkilll> law vs chaos i guess
[4:21:18] <SuperVaderMan> Zahn made Thrawn ye
[4:21:20] <mortelkilll> one lead to opression, the other to destruction
[4:21:37] <mortelkilll> but they are bot hforms of evil
[4:21:40] <%MarkSoupial> meaningless details? you mean L O R E
[4:21:42] <Triblade1992> James_Luceno is the Plaguies guy. Zahn is Thrawn Trilogy
[4:21:44] <+MalekDracarus> Yeah Thrawn is dope
[4:21:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @MarkSoupial well that's a shitty weapon design. Jedi design weapons like EA designs single player games
[4:22:04] <+m3chamike> @dukemoose hmm maybe i missed that in the books i read? Most of the old canon i read were written before the prequels.
[4:22:09] <%MarkSoupial> the revenge of the sith novelization is almost good
[4:22:12] <Triblade1992> I'm sttill holding out for the Thrawn Trilogy live action 3 season reboot
[4:22:16] <Manjove> always nice to see my tastes validated
[4:22:26] <otakon17> okay does ANYONE remember the body snatcher alien that basically eats bodies from the inside out and takes them over and it's like a hive mind?
[4:22:31] <SuperVaderMan> Thrawn is interesting as a villain, but not so much in the books where he's a protagonist
[4:22:32] <%MarkSoupial> " i AM a disturbance in the force" -anakin
[4:22:37] <otakon17> from Star Wars mind you
[4:22:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I remember the prequel books improving the story a bit, but it's been a while
[4:23:15] <%MarkSoupial> I've heard reading Shadow of the Sith or whatever the pre-phantom book was makes the move make more sense
[4:23:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "How could we fall into a trap. we're smarter then that!" -- Obi Wan Kenobi
[4:23:38] <%MarkSoupial> the ep 2 book is still pretty bad
[4:23:42] <+m3chamike> @triblade1992 It’s almost a definite that Thrawn will be in a live action movie at some point after episode 9. But I’m kinda worried they’ll fuck him up.
[4:23:50] <%MarkSoupial> ep 1 book has a lot more anakin stuff
[4:24:01] <jiin6> i've force fallen and i can't get up
[4:24:08] <SuperVaderMan> Sheeeeeev
[4:24:14] <Triblade1992> @m3chamike Lucasfilm saidd Zahn has final say on all things Thrawn. It's his character
[4:24:23] <+DukeMoose> Darth Bane: "Imma kill him wif a rock"
[4:24:52] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why would Sidious learn all these lightsaber styles and whatnot if he thinks they're worthless?
[4:24:55] <+MalekDracarus> Its always cowardly when it comes to killing the master
[4:24:55] <otakon17> "it was a BIG rock?"
[4:25:23] <otakon17> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw just because he can? Or not that he thought they were worthless but that he didn't NEED them anymore.
[4:25:33] <Frog_of_Justic> Still not as big as the rock they hit chewy with.
[4:25:34] <%MarkSoupial> are these visions supposed to be the dark souls scattered lore?
[4:25:37] <Snirtax> Sure is handy for the Jedi that the Sith keep killing each others like idiots
[4:25:40] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw he learned them cause he was that dedicated into mocking the jedi by defeating them with their own silly laser toys
[4:26:03] <otakon17> sounds like the thing the Anti Sprials did
[4:26:15] <mortelkilll> yeah the sith just sound like morons
[4:26:19] <otakon17> well there are climbable grates so maybe
[4:26:30] <Triblade1992> Sadly, if Palpatine had let Luke kill him, the Sith would have won
[4:26:36] <mortelkilll> im not even sure why they kill their master
[4:26:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @morcego_cinzento_arts that's a lot of work just fight with a handicap for mockery
[4:26:45] <Snirtax> Both the Sith and Jedi just sort of get railroaded into being morons, it's kind of baffling
[4:26:58] <+MalekDracarus> @mortelkilll Rule of 2
[4:27:10] <morcego_cinzento_arts> So Sidious was so incompetent in killing his master that he just shit talked him into suicide?
[4:27:32] <+DukeMoose> sheev continued to be terrified after he killed him because he had no clue if his master had secretly finished his immortality and would come back LUL
[4:27:39] <+m3chamike> Bane was all about survival of the fittest.
[4:27:40] <Snirtax> The writers somewhat built themselves into a corner by defining the mind-warping effects of the force so thoroughly
[4:27:43] <+MalekDracarus> @mortelkilll and the sith code
[4:27:49] <Breakend28> Eli!! Missed seeing you
[4:28:03] <AncelDeLambert> pffff, bitch, just kill her and start over with a new apprentice
[4:28:16] <AncelDeLambert> worries like that mean it's time for a mulligan
[4:28:21] <mortelkilll> dont think id bother wit happrentices
[4:28:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes I think Bane (and maybe Revan) were just the not completely retarded exception
[4:28:32] <%MarkSoupial> AAA
[4:28:43] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw May had been more work then it was needed. But you gotta admire this amount of effort for this level of Trolling. he's fucking evil and he loves it
[4:28:44] <AncelDeLambert> I think the reasoning they have is that a Sith is not a master without an apprentice
[4:28:50] <Snirtax> You'd think at this point the Sith would stop taking apprentices in
[4:28:50] <Triblade1992> this is why Palpatine should have let Luke kill him. Vader was able to kill Dooku and Luke was strong enough to kill Vader
[4:28:53] <AncelDeLambert> No apprentice means you're not worth shit and should give up
[4:29:00] <+claybore> Is it weird that I'm low-key beating off to Plague talking about Star Wars?
[4:29:03] <mostundesired> Sideous was a real slimeball tbh, even for Sith standards. He bent and broke a shit ton of rules for his own gain. Which is kind of awesome in that he's a shitlord amongst shitlords, but it doesn't make him actually cool.
[4:29:32] <Triblade1992> He was an evil Goku
[4:29:32] <Breakend28> So how is this EA game? I can't help but not trust it
[4:29:37] <jiin6> darth punch face
[4:29:53] <Triblade1992> "I'mma punch that Jedi in the SNOZZE!"
[4:29:57] <morcego_cinzento_arts> well by comparing him to the cast of lamoo and creepo characters in the preguels...then yes by comparison Sidious is cool
[4:30:02] <AncelDeLambert> @Breakend28 it's very middling and inoffensive. Get it on sale.
[4:30:26] <Snirtax> Who are the Sith impressing by taking apprentices anyway ? Why would you do it when it's got a near 100% casualty rate
[4:30:46] <jiin6> good job that guy
[4:30:52] <%MarkSoupial> character development in star wars??
[4:30:52] <Triblade1992> stormtroopers are no 95% incompetent
[4:30:55] <ziggyjesus> A more engaging story than the main plot
[4:30:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Maybe Sith lords are like adrenaline junkies and suffer from too much boredom
[4:31:10] <Snirtax> "Hey let me keep this ambitious little shit within backstabbing distance at all times"
[4:31:19] <Breakend28> Yeah on sale maybe unless it's the EA patch of BS
[4:31:48] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Snirtax to keep some kind of faction in place, even after they will eventually die. but yeah, it does beg the question why more don't just say "fuck it" and do their own thing.
[4:32:01] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[4:32:35] <+Pat_Squared> its funny I was literally just talking to my roommate about bane and his bugs not like an hour ago
[4:32:57] <Snirtax> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Yeah, that or keep a loose relations with a bunch of other siths, while keeping them comfortably far away
[4:32:59] <morcego_cinzento_arts> he became that wasp hive ninja in Ninja Scroll
[4:33:04] <mostundesired> So he's a Sith Boomer?
[4:33:11] <Snirtax> A sort of Sith alliance would actually be really cool
[4:33:12] <kiwiredgrave> Banes ghost was so cool in the clone wars. Also voiced by mark hamill
[4:33:23] <Triblade1992> well got to start somewhere. He was blazing the trail and wasn't all knowing
[4:33:41] <jiin6> it you ha ha ha
[4:34:37] <%MarkSoupial> these guys sound bored
[4:34:39] <mcexcadrill> imagine bane and sidious combined as one sith
[4:34:50] <AncelDeLambert> ah, well that was dumb of him
[4:34:52] <+Genericmistake> what podcast?
[4:34:54] <+MalekDracarus> @PlagueOfGripes How did you feel about Nihilis?
[4:34:57] <Breakend28> Hearing the name Bane just reminds of Batman & Robin
[4:35:38] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Breakend28 IF I TAKE OUT THOSE BUGS, WILL YOU DIE?
[4:35:52] <kiwiredgrave> that's hot
[4:35:57] <mostundesired> Pregnant?
[4:35:59] <%MarkSoupial> whoa
[4:36:24] <Triblade1992> imagine if Bane's soul kept traveling through the 1000 generations to Sidious. That would be messed up
[4:36:34] <ziggyjesus> @TheOneGuyYouSaw LOTTA LOYALTY FOR A HIRED BOUNTY HUNTER
[4:36:40] <ahegotrigger> itd be pretty rad
[4:36:43] <AncelDeLambert> wow, look at those freakouts in the animation
[4:37:11] <AncelDeLambert> a WHAT?
[4:37:15] <LordPubious> Biff
[4:37:19] <LordPubious> Tanner
[4:37:28] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes which Sith Lord was the most based?
[4:37:28] <%MarkSoupial> n
[4:37:32] <SuperVaderMan> Bith, the guys who play the instruments in the cantina
[4:37:47] <LordPubious> like Figran D'an and The Modal Nodes?
[4:37:52] <Triblade1992> remember when Lucas wanted that twe'lik that was a fetishy Darth Maul and Darth Maul to be friends?
[4:38:00] <Triblade1992> Darth Talon I believe her name was
[4:38:04] <+m3chamike> I remember
[4:38:14] <Manjove> yeah, they were both red
[4:38:16] <Manjove> and hot
[4:38:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> funny enough, i don't if they kept it in the cannon. But the style of jazz that those aliens play in the Cantina is called "giz"
[4:38:32] <lennyrager> So a bad revan
[4:39:10] <+m3chamike> God they screwed over Revan so much in TOR
[4:39:13] <kiwiredgrave> ironically what happened in the movies is some of the least important things to happen to the universe
[4:39:23] <%MarkSoupial> yeah not being a jedi WOULD make jedi stuff kinda hard
[4:39:33] <+MalekDracarus> Yeah they are
[4:39:45] <Manjove> Order 66 was pretty significant
[4:39:47] <xvalltendo> when do we get to see jar jar?
[4:39:48] <Frog_of_Justic> The Jizz Band Kappa
[4:40:03] <%MarkSoupial> yup
[4:40:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @m3chamike that retcoon that revan was being manipulated all along? yeah taht was bad
[4:40:13] <%MarkSoupial> jizz wailing
[4:40:13] <Triblade1992> Krayt
[4:40:16] <Manjove> Krayt
[4:40:37] <+DukeMoose> the former Tusken raider jedi that fell
[4:40:47] <%MarkSoupial> mphDill URR
[4:40:48] <SuperVaderMan> Specifically he was a guy who was adopted into the raiders
[4:40:50] <+m3chamike> Also Revan went nuts and wanted to literally kill everyone, right?
[4:41:00] <morcego_cinzento_arts> all the fans of that band got jizz on their ears listening to them
[4:41:11] <Triblade1992> I hate how there was a planet full of Sith Lords just hanging around for 1050 years and Palpatine and Vader NEVER SENSED THAT
[4:41:20] <+DukeMoose> @supervaderman his father was adopted. he was raised in it
[4:41:23] <+Manofsalt> My favorite piece of EU nonsense is when that red droid that Luke and Owen are about to buy is actually a Clone Wars vet and knows how important R2 is so he sacrifices himself
[4:41:25] <+MalekDracarus> @m3chamike kind of
[4:41:30] <Triblade1992> Palps would have had an anyurism if he actually sensed it
[4:41:32] <%MarkSoupial> i wish there was a end of star wars
[4:41:32] <Manjove> Talon is so fuckin' hot
[4:42:03] <Manjove> was*
[4:42:13] <+m3chamike> Remember when they made it so the Tusken Raiders were the survivors of a huge war that happened before the Sith and Jedi ever existed?
[4:42:13] <%MarkSoupial> just fuckin Korra it, give everyone force powers
[4:42:17] <%MarkSoupial> do it, ep 9
[4:42:18] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Talon is teh reason why they got so many to convert to the sith if they can get close to that piece of red edge lord booty
[4:42:32] <AncelDeLambert> yep, comics REALLY fucked things up
[4:42:36] <%MarkSoupial> so the mandalorian
[4:42:37] <Manjove> It took a whole Moon to kill Chewbacca
[4:42:39] <%MarkSoupial> got it
[4:42:44] <Triblade1992> Sun Crusher?
[4:43:00] <mortelkilll> isnt that how most star wars fans see luke and han solo?
[4:43:03] <+Manofsalt> Star Wars Legacy is still my favorite. That's what the new trilogy should have been.
[4:43:10] <%MarkSoupial> wat u mean, he did flips and stacked rocks
[4:43:13] <morcego_cinzento_arts> to quote Rich Evans "everybody appears on the funeral for this unknown elderly space pirate"
[4:43:15] <SuperVaderMan> Luke's just some guy LUL
[4:43:20] <Snirtax> Man that problem sure has a long history doesn't it ?
[4:43:23] <AncelDeLambert> Han and Leia's kid becomes like the fucking kuisatz haddarak
[4:43:24] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Are you saying that Luke is a Mary Sue?
[4:43:24] <+MalekDracarus> @Manjove I REMEMBER THAT LuL
[4:43:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> *gasp
[4:43:31] <mcexcadrill> kindof like that one writer with madalorians and their hate-boner for jedi?
[4:43:42] <+Manofsalt> #BringBackTheShotoSaber
[4:43:43] <Manjove> Karen Traviss
[4:43:43] <%MarkSoupial> I CLAPPED
[4:43:44] <Triblade1992> 900 year old muppet who's been around is somehow weaker than Luke Skywalker
[4:43:49] <Triblade1992> in old EU
[4:43:55] <Triblade1992> Abeloth AKA Mother
[4:43:56] <SuperVaderMan> Karen traviss is the one who hated the jedi and kept giving handies to the mandalorians
[4:44:01] <morcego_cinzento_arts> remember heirs of the Empire?
[4:44:05] <mortelkilll> to be honest star wars 9 is not sounding so far from this crazyness
[4:44:06] <Manjove> the weird Cthulu lady
[4:44:10] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> was Snoke a Sith, or some other shit?
[4:44:19] <Manjove> doesnt matter anymore
[4:44:24] <mortelkilll> i liek the concept of the maw but aboloth a bit absurd
[4:44:24] <Triblade1992> She's prototype Kaguya Ootosuki from Naruto
[4:44:25] <mcexcadrill> it would be a karen Kappa
[4:44:32] <%MarkSoupial> Momma Gorrath
[4:44:36] <+pwnjones> Think of the power required to keep that saber blade on as a flashlight, because the Republic doesn't have LED's
[4:44:41] <Manjove> but Midichlorians @PlagueOfGripes
[4:44:41] <+RaikenTB> hueg number Kreygasm
[4:44:51] <Heartless_01> big number make penis big hard
[4:44:53] <+m3chamike> I just want more stuff about characters like Thrawn who thinks the Sith and Jedi are both dumb and want to move on
[4:44:59] <AncelDeLambert> Disney deserves shit for not putting anything of worth in its place, yeah
[4:45:04] <AncelDeLambert> but the EU needed to die
[4:45:13] <+Manofsalt> I'd rather have complete nonsense than generic whatever
[4:45:27] <mortelkilll> i dont have a horse in the race, never been big into star wars
[4:45:27] <mcexcadrill> i rather have bad eu than an unsubstantial eu
[4:45:37] <jiin6> objective reached : found the lightswitch
[4:45:38] <Triblade1992> Disney can reboot a few select things.
[4:45:45] <Triblade1992> like Thrawn trilogy
[4:45:54] <+RaikenTB> I prefer the story of Kyle Katarn stealing the Death Star plans.
[4:46:00] <Samex_Comex> Oh no they teamed up with the rats
[4:46:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Snoke was probably a legit sith lord but Rian "Reverted your expectations" Johnson thought of him as a nobody sith with some weird golden robe
[4:46:15] <+DukeMoose> thrawn exists in Disney so it's not hard uncanoned
[4:46:17] <mortelkilll> i wish snoke was an actua lgiant
[4:46:25] <+Manofsalt> The old EU novels were pretty interesting but the Disney ones are boring as sin
[4:46:26] <mortelkilll> and we got a cool attack o ntitan fight scene wit hhim
[4:46:33] <cerazor01> So many references in this game to stuff I dont care about
[4:46:39] <LordFalara> i played 2 hours of this and its better than anything and everything weve gotten post disney and im so happy
[4:46:43] <%MarkSoupial> man this really is like dark souls, except 2 where there are 4 enemies with different skins
[4:46:52] <SuperVaderMan> @m3chamike Zahn's back to making Thrawn novels in the new canon
[4:46:57] <cerazor01> The combat in this outside of duels looks so boring
[4:47:04] <%MarkSoupial> *except mostly
[4:47:04] <AncelDeLambert> this time dilation power seems like it would be MORE advanced than simply pushing things
[4:47:10] <AncelDeLambert> like... a million times more advanced
[4:47:14] <+Genericmistake> seemed like a secret cave lower then the platform you landed on
[4:47:19] <cerazor01> I think the new Zahn books are okay
[4:47:26] <+Genericmistake> might be crazy though
[4:47:28] <mortelkilll> all animals are assholes
[4:47:33] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> how many sheep legs have you broken?
[4:47:33] <Manjove> best books in the new canon at least
[4:47:38] <+m3chamike> @supervaderman I know. But I want some other characters besides Thrawn.
[4:47:39] <mortelkilll> we are all united in our animalistic assholery
[4:47:46] <+DukeMoose> isnt that the thing that Yoda rode?
[4:47:59] <Heartless_01> LMAO
[4:48:00] <+RaikenTB> Pat thought cotton came from sheep LUL
[4:48:04] <mcexcadrill> wow sheep are dicks
[4:48:10] <Triblade1992> the nu canon also fixes the ridiculous power level nonsense that the old EU caused
[4:48:14] <morcego_cinzento_arts> sheep are bigger assholes then goats. In vet med school i had to be careful to not be head butted in my knees by one of those lil assholes
[4:48:31] <Manjove> oh plague, that noise
[4:48:34] <+Manofsalt> The most interesting Novel/Comic thing Disney did was a story about Obi-Wan and Anakin between 1 and 2. We never get to see what thing were like before 2 really.
[4:49:03] <+Manofsalt> They go to a steampunk planet in the middle of a civil war
[4:49:12] <Manjove> HOW
[4:49:21] <LordFalara> if only the last jedi hadnt been the worst
[4:49:26] <Samex_Comex> Darth slippy
[4:49:38] <Manjove> Force Awakens already started that trend
[4:49:40] <Huntercd> Darth Jar Jar
[4:49:41] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> I've never 180'd father on anything than after watching 8
[4:49:42] <Triblade1992> TLJ was fine entertainment wise.
[4:49:45] <otakon17> I FUCKING KNEW HE'D FALL
[4:49:47] <+m3chamike> Last Jedi was flawed but it was fine
[4:49:48] <ziggyjesus> hahah
[4:49:49] <Manjove> no it wasnt
[4:49:51] <LordFalara> whats the lore for vanishing corpses
[4:50:01] <+RaikenTB> I'm sure the writer of Batman v Superman will salvage the series LUL
[4:50:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> "It's about family. And that's what is so powerful about it"
[4:50:07] <%MarkSoupial> the force is not a power you have
[4:50:10] <ziggyjesus> Channel your pain into more power
[4:50:11] <+m3chamike> Last Jedi was better than the prequels
[4:50:13] <beetbo2> He vanished just like Luke
[4:50:14] <King_thunder365> Magic pixels will guide thee to victory!
[4:50:16] <Snirtax> The last Jedi has gotta be my favorite awful thing, it's so bad it defies belief
[4:50:26] <mortelkilll> if they did not develop rey yet, they never will, shes a dead weight now
[4:50:38] <LordFalara> last jedi was a cinematic abortion that ruined space combat in star wars and demolished luke skywalkee as a charecter while progressing none of the charecters
[4:50:39] <Manjove> but also god
[4:50:44] <%MarkSoupial> why develop
[4:50:44] <dowmein> why do you have jojo powers
[4:50:52] <otakon17> Dammit Plague why is jumping so hard?
[4:50:56] <%MarkSoupial> people like rogue one for some reason and that had literally no development
[4:51:08] <mortelkilll> i think it kind of made sense for luke to be a wreck but i dont know the detail of whats the issues wit hhis character direction
[4:51:11] <LordFalara> now episode 9 has to basically be the start and end of a trilogy of movies
[4:51:14] <%MarkSoupial> all it did was add more plotholes to a new hope
[4:51:20] <Manjove> i agree
[4:51:34] <beetbo2> you had full stims
[4:51:42] <Triblade1992> okay that was funny
[4:51:47] <+Manofsalt> why were people so mad that disney had a 3rd death star? star tours did it first Kappa
[4:51:50] <ziggyjesus> Rogue One was sorta like Space Vietnam, it made no sense storywise, but was fun to look at
[4:51:52] <+nesence2> rogue one was liked becasue it was almsot ok, which is way better than the other new films
[4:51:52] <mortelkilll> seemed liek peopel wanted luke to be this badass wise master and i dont think it would have made sense
[4:51:57] <+m3chamike> I thought they did a great job with Luke in The Last Jedi
[4:52:01] <mortelkilll> probably could have handled hi mway better trough
[4:52:06] <Snirtax> It's a 180 on his entire development. Dude was willing to help darth fucking vader but gave up on the son of his best friend ?
[4:52:09] <+vandesdelca0> the last jedi was bad on a level that makes you question the sanity of the writers
[4:52:09] <LordFalara> rogue one isnt as half baked as solo, and doesnt have the baggage of episode 7s mystery boxes thay go nowhere, or tljs cinematic incompetence
[4:52:20] <Manjove> i thought luke was the worst part of TLJ
[4:52:24] <%MarkSoupial> old bitter luke who basically jumpstarted the first order made sense
[4:52:31] <LordFalara> its not a good movie, but it doesnt make you want to claw your eyes out
[4:52:34] <Manjove> but it doesnt
[4:52:34] <+Manofsalt> Rogue One feels like am old EU novel which I like but the characters are paper thin
[4:52:41] <LordFalara> and it didnt wholesale ruin anything
[4:52:53] <morcego_cinzento_arts> I would say taht despite a more the a few sharp bumps in the road, Last Jedi was leading to an interesting idea...then in the middle of the movie they turned that interesting idea into shit, smeared it all over our faces and to this day there is taht stupid defense of "it escedes your espectations"
[4:52:55] <Manjove> Return Luke would never have done what he did in TLJ
[4:52:56] <beetbo2> Luke being old and bitter would make more sense if they SHOWED how he became old and bitter.
[4:52:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Snirtax "He's my father, I could never kill my father no matter now evil he is. Now a nephew that did literally nothing wrong..."
[4:53:04] <sjotyme86> don't hurt the pokemon BibleThump
[4:53:04] <+nesence2> i wanted luke to be consistent, not want to murder his nephew in his sleep...
[4:53:05] <LordFalara> tlj should just be evacuated from canon like they evacuated akbar
[4:53:06] <mortelkilll> biggest problem definately is rey having next to not meaningful developpement after 2 movies
[4:53:07] <beetbo2> and what they DID show wasn't enough
[4:53:08] <+RaikenTB> If only you had some kind of force fence to contain these animals.
[4:53:24] <mostundesired> Nice.
[4:53:24] <+nesence2> oh yeah acbar died basicly offscreen.
[4:53:28] <SuperVaderMan> Reflect this rocket LUL
[4:53:32] <Snirtax> You genuinely can't take the Last Jedi appart without a blackboard, it's so dense in its awfulness
[4:53:42] <Manjove> ^
[4:53:42] <%MarkSoupial> what REALLY doesn't make sense, is Leia had a perfect out for the series
[4:53:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> there is a reason that Mark Hamil said "I hate everything you did with my character"
[4:53:57] <%MarkSoupial> SHE should have been the one to lightspeed dash into the order
[4:53:58] <LordFalara> tlj couldve genuinely been fantastic if you tweaked a few things, basically if rian hadnt gone with his, as he has stated, first draft
[4:54:16] <%MarkSoupial> like after years of hearing han talkabout flying through space and the dangers of lightspeed
[4:54:26] <Snirtax> Every single level of that movie, from the the main characters to the most minute details is riddled with absolute nonsense
[4:54:32] <LordFalara> the lightspeed dash shouldnt exist
[4:54:39] <ziggyjesus> Having only 3 heals seems awfully strict for a game like this
[4:54:40] <+vandesdelca0> none of it should exist
[4:54:41] <LordFalara> because it fundamentally ruins space combat
[4:54:43] <%MarkSoupial> LUL
[4:54:46] <lennyrager> Didn't Hamill take that bac
[4:54:47] <beetbo2> no
[4:54:49] <beetbo2> gravity
[4:54:50] <SuperVaderMan> death to spinny doodle LUL
[4:54:53] <beetbo2> gravity got u
[4:55:01] <LordFalara> why didnt they lightspeed dash the desth stars, or the star destroyers at hoth
[4:55:03] <Manjove> because Disney told him to STFU
[4:55:07] <mortelkilll> bringing back sidious for 9 seem like such a bad idea
[4:55:12] <LordSDB> Wait is this doing the dark souls you die and lose your xp?
[4:55:15] <+m3chamike> But in the old movies Luke thought of murdering his dad. Like for more than a minute. It completely makes sense for Luke to give in to his doubts for a fraction of a second, and cause the whole Kylo Ren thing.
[4:55:21] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @lennyrager he "clarified" his statements while looking completely dead inside in interviews, and then went back to shitting on it again
[4:55:23] <mortelkilll> and an admissions that they didnt build anythign meaningful in the new trilogy
[4:55:24] <beetbo2> wonder why there's that blur effect on the time stop
[4:55:32] <cerazor01> Let's just talk about something else.
[4:55:33] <+Manofsalt> @Manjove What are they gonna do? Fire him? He's Luke fucking Skywalker
[4:55:33] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Rian "Empire would had been thrashed nowadays" Johnson
[4:55:33] <+nesence2> maybe no one should have light speeded in to the order, the fact that light speed is now weaponizable makes every combat irrelevant.
[4:55:37] <%MarkSoupial> all force awakens had to do was not be prequel-bad
[4:55:38] <beetbo2> they wanted another MCU cash cow
[4:55:41] <SuperVaderMan> TLJ was big waste of time, narratively
[4:55:45] <LordFalara> force awakens was a okay setup, tlj made it a bad movie retroactively
[4:55:45] <beetbo2> without wanting to do all the prep work
[4:55:48] <Manjove> i dont know, listen to him?
[4:55:48] <+RaikenTB> It had stronk women characters.
[4:56:10] <%MarkSoupial> how come they never land near the GIANT JEDI BUILDINGS
[4:56:13] <Triblade1992> They are still working with Rian Johnson though. They didn't kick him out like D and D
[4:56:16] <Snirtax> Anyone remember the hyperslow, magnetic space bombers ? The loss of which was supposedly devastating to the rebellion ?
[4:56:24] <LordPubious> the narrative doesn't matter as long as they can hook a new generation of customers to sell lunchboxes to
[4:56:29] <LordFalara> a suicide run into the big dumb ship wouldve been fine, but not a super infinity doom lightspeed dash
[4:56:36] <beetbo2> Star Wars was more or less like that
[4:56:39] <%MarkSoupial> the thing about risk is that it's risky
[4:56:42] <+nesence2> Force awakens has some serious structural issues. would have been forgivable if the follow up had been good
[4:56:45] <+Manofsalt> You need some vague roadmap though. They didn't have shit for this trilogy.
[4:56:46] <Manjove> no credit for disney, they should have had a plan written out
[4:56:47] <beetbo2> did u hear about the 6 versions of Rise of Skywalker?
[4:56:50] <Snirtax> Anyone wanna talk about Snoke ? Actually, anyone remember Snoke ?
[4:56:51] <beetbo2> that's still going on
[4:56:53] <dowmein> do they always have a storm trooper cheerleader?
[4:56:53] <kiwiredgrave> @PlagueOfGripes DId you know Ryan Johnson is trying to say "W-well the Empire Strikes Back was also very divisive" as if that wasn't a blatant lie
[4:57:04] <beetbo2> they gave up on that
[4:57:05] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> did they finish the reshoots for 9?
[4:57:17] <LordFalara> no
[4:57:25] <beetbo2> The did 6 different versions
[4:57:25] <LordFalara> at this point itll be done live on stage
[4:57:28] <Manjove> JJ should have written an outline, not nothing
[4:57:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> D&D "We gangbanged raped Game of Thrones cause we were betting on having a seat at Disney's table. i guess we fucked that plan now"
[4:57:28] <beetbo2> of 9
[4:57:29] <mortelkilll> i dont think ill watch 9
[4:57:37] <LordFalara> like that scene in reign of fire
[4:57:40] <Manjove> TFA broke shit too
[4:57:43] <+vandesdelca0> it's pretty common knowledge that rian johnson is a bad writer but a good director. i don't know why they let him do it.
[4:57:48] <LordPubious> the last movie was very tonally disjointed
[4:57:50] <beetbo2> Yeah
[4:57:50] <+m3chamike> Space combat in Star Wars has always been dumb as fuck. They’re shooting at each other WHITHING EYESIGHT OF EACH OTHER! IN SPACE
[4:57:54] <Snirtax> I don't get why people defend force awaken so much when it's so similar to the one that comes before in canon. It's not good.
[4:57:56] <mostundesired> I still would, TFA was very uninspired.
[4:57:58] <Triblade1992> Nah, they just would have made it Empire Strikes Back the Reboot.
[4:57:58] <+vectorless_peon> Rey would still be boring
[4:58:01] <ahegotrigger> kind of because it was still boring
[4:58:06] <+Manofsalt> Why didn't they give it to Jon Favreau or Dave Filoni
[4:58:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> it would be alright, so better than the prequels
[4:58:07] <beetbo2> mainly due to their behind the scenes work
[4:58:09] <%MarkSoupial> diversion for the sake of diversion is some M. Night shit
[4:58:10] <Huntercd> Just have Finn and Rey create a new order and Kylo create a new dark one
[4:58:12] <beetbo2> rather than the movies themselves
[4:58:13] <mortelkilll> luke was boring in 4
[4:58:14] <+nesence2> eh, id be unhappy, but less angry.
[4:58:14] <Triblade1992> And i would have just said :"WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS?"
[4:58:14] <ziggyjesus> Sort of, it would just be a retread of the OT
[4:58:20] <mortelkilll> rey could have improved with good writers
[4:58:20] <somelurker> rey is still a bland protag
[4:58:27] <mortelkilll> yeah shes kidn of hopeless now
[4:58:28] <beetbo2> it'd be a slow whimper instead of an explosion
[4:58:30] <dowmein> some real gameplay
[4:58:31] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Rian "I'm dishonestly missremember the original trilogy to justify my shitty movie and blame the fansinstead of admiting i di a shitty movie"
[4:58:31] <beetbo2> like TLJ
[4:58:32] <mortelkilll> she was ok in 7
[4:58:32] <LordFalara> finn was the only good charecter idea they had
[4:58:35] <ahegotrigger> I just dont give a shit about anyone in that universe anymore thats the problem
[4:58:37] <+pwnjones> I think I'm glad I didn't buy this
[4:58:40] <LordFalara> and they made him human c3po
[4:58:42] <Triblade1992> Why bother making the movies just OT with a bit of the next movie bleeding into the previous movie
[4:58:44] <beetbo2> LOL
[4:58:46] <jiin6> hahah
[4:58:47] <Manjove> TFA broke star wars too
[4:58:49] <beetbo2> he float
[4:58:50] <mortelkilll> yeah i dont give a shit about anyone either in new star wars
[4:58:51] <ziggyjesus> As someone who never had nostalgia for the OT, I wouldn't care, but the hardcore fans would be upset
[4:58:51] <kiwiredgrave> Finn should have died in TLJ
[4:58:51] <otakon17> what was THAT?
[4:58:57] <ahegotrigger> LUL that looked so great
[4:58:57] <+vandesdelca0> TFA is like a 6/10. it's fine. just fine.
[4:58:59] <Huntercd> Turn Finn into Kyle Katarn
[4:58:59] <%MarkSoupial> rey is nothing, finn is enourmously underused, and why is poe even there?
[4:59:04] <beetbo2> They never USED Finn
[4:59:12] <SuperVaderMan> Finn LUL
[4:59:12] <beetbo2> which sucks
[4:59:13] <+yoshkosh20> mn \ test \ m\
[4:59:15] <+Manofsalt> Yep they're real
[4:59:16] <+nesence2> finn could have been great, but was used for nothing.
[4:59:16] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> apparently the novels explained that Rey is able to master things without prior experience
[4:59:17] <+RaikenTB> TLJ killed any interest I had in the new characters.
[4:59:18] <Snirtax> Honestly TFA was the beginning of the end. Rey was incredibly poorly established as super strong female luke, while a ridiculously large Empire force just kinds of manifests out of nowhere and is barely touched upon. Where the fuck did Snoke come from ?
[4:59:18] <+vandesdelca0> oh no they used Finn. it was just awful.
[4:59:23] <+vectorless_peon> Fin is okay but majorly badly written and underdeveloped
[4:59:27] <beetbo2> O O F
[4:59:34] <Manjove> so, Finn wasa bad
[4:59:42] <%MarkSoupial> LUL
[4:59:43] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> "she was just having a moment."
[4:59:48] <%MarkSoupial> i mean
[4:59:49] <ziggyjesus> China disapproves
[4:59:51] <+nesence2> finn could be super interesting if hed did anything
[4:59:53] <+vandesdelca0> just the woman troubles
[4:59:53] <kiwiredgrave> FINN SHOULD HAVE DIED IN TLJ
[5:00:00] <beetbo2> ^
[5:00:01] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> women amirite
[5:00:03] <Manjove> you literally described how he is bad @vectorless_peon
[5:00:05] <%MarkSoupial> they were TRYING to say they won't win for REAL if they resort to like suicide mission
[5:00:06] <Snirtax> Fin is the one decent character to came out of all this, but boy did they do their best to ruin him
[5:00:15] <%MarkSoupial> but like right AFTER suicide mission allowed them to get to that point
[5:00:23] <+nesence2> 100% the best one
[5:00:24] <Triblade1992> Rian getting rid of fan theories was better than "lets make Empire Strikes Back with a little bit of RotJ" which is what Star Wars fanatics wanted.
[5:00:24] <beetbo2> By virtue of existing
[5:00:24] <+vandesdelca0> it's mostly the actor i think
[5:00:25] <+m3chamike> The wahmen and their emotions dontchaknow
[5:00:29] <beetbo2> and having an ACTUAL arc
[5:00:30] <Manjove> he is completely inconsistent like all the others
[5:00:33] <beetbo2> (albeit repeated)
[5:00:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> She stopped Finn from saving hundreds of rebels cause she was hving a moment
[5:00:41] <beetbo2> (for TWO movies in a row)
[5:00:48] <+RaikenTB> I liked Poe before TLJ NotLikeThis
[5:00:51] <LordFalara> ways to salvage star wars
[5:00:54] <mostundesired> Credit where it's due, Poe COULD be fun, if they put him in the right situations.
[5:00:55] <Snirtax> The backdown away from Rose is my favorite thing ever
[5:00:56] <+TheSaintJohn> kylo had the potential to be really interesting, but nothings happened for two movies
[5:00:58] <beetbo2> @morcego_cinzento_arts Rose nearly KILLED Finn becuase she was having a moment
[5:01:07] <beetbo2> remember, she CRASHED into him
[5:01:07] <+nesence2> poe could have been good...
[5:01:07] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> they ruined the ginger dude in one scene, too
[5:01:09] <Manjove> Poe was totally right the entire time in TLJ
[5:01:12] <beetbo2> AT HIGH SPEED
[5:01:19] <+nesence2> pow was wrong at the end
[5:01:21] <%MarkSoupial> to be fair, qui gon COULD have been good
[5:01:24] <+nesence2> tpoe rather
[5:01:27] <bevyrage> almost fell for it too
[5:01:29] <%MarkSoupial> espaecially with the hinted stuff in 2
[5:01:30] <+RaikenTB> And Flasma could have been interesting too...
[5:01:32] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @beetbo2 It was a very moment moment
[5:01:32] <%MarkSoupial> but this is star wars
[5:01:42] <kiwiredgrave> is this like Nioh shit going on?
[5:01:42] <%MarkSoupial> star wars cant be actually good
[5:01:46] <+vandesdelca0> oh god i forgot about the nothing that was Phasma
[5:01:48] <mortelkilll> we probably shoudlnt be mad that they didnt gave finn a useless heroci sacrifice, this trope dumb
[5:01:50] <+nesence2> the character is bad not the acting
[5:01:52] <+vectorless_peon> Finn as a concept is okay he just needs to be written by someone compotent
[5:01:52] <LordFalara> 1. no more trilogys for a long while. 2. hire better writers for comics and novels, fix the holes tlj introduced. 3. dont drag up old skeletons like palpatine, but use old canon stuff, stop makijg new tattooines.
[5:01:54] <Snirtax> But don't you know that commander hairdew was a military genius the whole time and had it all under control, despite sucking ass at her job in every way ?
[5:01:55] <+yoshkosh20> hell there
[5:01:55] <beetbo2> They exist to pander
[5:01:57] <Manjove> CAPITALISM BAD, SAVE THE ANIMALS, NOT THE CHILD SLAVES
[5:01:58] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but Plague, the Asian market!
[5:02:00] <+Manofsalt> My problem with TLJ is that Kylo was saying he was gonna move past all the status quo but at the end of the movie he's such a cartoony villain
[5:02:07] <beetbo2> They EXIST to pander to people who won't actually see the movies
[5:02:08] <Huntercd> Bad writing
[5:02:10] <LordFalara> and finally, 4. fucking make more god damn good videogames
[5:02:13] <MartiusGW> so trooper shouting traitor to finn is still best new character
[5:02:17] <bevyrage> they exist to tug at the tropes and nostalgia but don't have the benefit of being beloved because they're too new
[5:02:19] <beetbo2> to get brownie points without telling an actual story
[5:02:22] <beetbo2> AKA
[5:02:31] <+m3chamike> Yeah Rose is just the exact same character as Finn was, basically.
[5:02:38] <beetbo2> They exist not to be characters, but to be literal bait
[5:02:40] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> the fact that China hated it is hilarious
[5:02:46] <LordFalara> they uglied up kelly mary tran
[5:02:48] <beetbo2> Not just any market
[5:02:48] <%MarkSoupial> rose exists for that necklace thing
[5:02:53] <Manjove> White man bad
[5:02:54] <beetbo2> to people who WE KNOW
[5:02:54] <%MarkSoupial> which turned out to be pointless anyway
[5:02:54] <LordFalara> they made her a potato
[5:02:56] <bevyrage> well it's real obvious from china's poster why they hated it
[5:02:58] <+vandesdelca0> it's ruining the whole film industry honestly
[5:02:59] <beetbo2> won't see the movies
[5:03:05] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Flasma, a character which all of the hype is that she was a strong female startropper offcier. such strong female presence in a character that we don't even see without a helmet that obscures her humanity and in consequence her gender
[5:03:06] <+nesence2> and none of the were used
[5:03:06] <Manjove> the one black guy in the First Order is a hero
[5:03:14] <Triblade1992> I rather have what Rian did than just go through another "let's reboot the old story" thing. I understood why TFA did what it did but they shouldn't do that crap again
[5:03:28] <mortelkilll> yeah there nothign left to build upon for 9
[5:03:28] <%MarkSoupial> imagine expecting JJ Abrams to plan long-term
[5:03:29] <ahegotrigger> TRUE
[5:03:29] <+vectorless_peon> the new movies would be good if they had a theme and overarcing plot BEFORE the TFA
[5:03:33] <beetbo2> Imagine in Rian got into Marvel
[5:03:36] <+Manofsalt> China is never gonna accept Star Wars. Movies were banned for 2 decades.
[5:03:36] <beetbo2> and there was no plan
[5:03:46] <SuperVaderMan> Worse, he doesn't set up anything interesting himself. He just throws TFA in the garbage and that's it LUL
[5:03:51] <mostundesired> I stand by my opinion that Snoke was a waste of time and I'm glad he's dead.
[5:03:53] <beetbo2> well of course, Plague
[5:03:56] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Incredible how Plague's description of Rian Johnson is so close to mine in my mind
[5:03:59] <beetbo2> becuase that was the POINT
[5:04:03] <%MarkSoupial> Lost was planned as far as the very first shot and the very last shot
[5:04:05] <+Tevvy> i mean they let him do it
[5:04:07] <+RaikenTB> "I'll end my own entire career"
[5:04:08] <mortelkilll> yeah snoke was an awful vilain from the get go but they did nothing of value to replace him
[5:04:09] <Snirtax> The Force Awakens and what it established could have been saved if someone good had stepped up to the plate
[5:04:09] <beetbo2> by the way
[5:04:10] <Triblade1992> Nah, they never fired him. Rian is still on board with them
[5:04:11] <beetbo2> Plague
[5:04:13] <beetbo2> did you hear
[5:04:15] <Frog_of_Justic> We will always have the scene of Luke sucking an alien titty
[5:04:18] <mortelkilll> bringing back palpatine was such a cop out
[5:04:19] <ziggyjesus> What I'm shocked by is that Star Wars was such a massive cultural even, but nobody seems to care anymore. I remember in my highschool, everyone was wearing Star Wars clothing and excited for The Force Awakens.
[5:04:20] <beetbo2> he's probably not getting that trilogy of his
[5:04:23] <Triblade1992> They never fired him unlike D&D
[5:04:23] <%MarkSoupial> now how excited are you for the GoT team movies? Kappa
[5:04:24] <ziggyjesus> Not anymore
[5:04:30] <+m3chamike> Well the problem with the new films is they’re treating Star Wars like current Marvel, but they forgot that it took like 5 years of setup to get there.
[5:04:30] <+nesence2> whe nyou do it well
[5:04:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> like shitting in the urinal
[5:04:34] <LordFalara> pablo hidalgo is an absolutely worthless human being who told rian his ideas fit into canon and for this he should be purged
[5:04:35] <Mrhuggles> Who's Ryan? sounds like a swell guy. bitterLOL
[5:04:40] <beetbo2> D&D and Rian are not getting their trilogies from what i hear
[5:04:42] <beetbo2> and if 9 fails
[5:04:46] <beetbo2> it's going to TV now
[5:04:49] <+vandesdelca0> after TLJ and Solo not even Star Wars can survive that
[5:04:49] <ahegotrigger> it subverted expectations by just being way worse than I thought it would be
[5:04:53] <ahegotrigger> so there is that
[5:04:56] <%MarkSoupial> let star wars die
[5:04:58] <beetbo2> where the Mandalorian's gonna have to keep the liscense alive
[5:05:04] <Snirtax> There were so many ways to subvert expectations that actually made sense and would've made for a good story. Dude just can't write for shit
[5:05:04] <mortelkilll> make the story that make sense with your themes
[5:05:09] <Triblade1992> Only D&D isn't getting theirs. Rian is still on board
[5:05:10] <Manjove> all they had to do was more than nothing!
[5:05:11] <+vectorless_peon> Ryan J Does not understand the meaning of subversion in the concept of writing
[5:05:12] <Arrozo> Thats the thing. They are still giving Rian more Star Wars films
[5:05:17] <mortelkilll> if there predicatable parts so be it
[5:05:22] <LordFalara> i dont trust mandalorian to not shit the bed
[5:05:26] <beetbo2> ^
[5:05:26] <+pwnjones> Mandalorian was great until that knife kill.
[5:05:28] <mortelkilll> you dont have to put twists everywhere
[5:05:38] <beetbo2> The moment I heard people say that the Mandalorian was good
[5:05:38] <%MarkSoupial> i watched 15 minutes of the mandalorian. every scene was a shot for shot of another scene in a star wars
[5:05:40] <LordFalara> rian johnson doesnt understand good writing in general
[5:05:40] <mortelkilll> just make the story that fit your ideas
[5:05:43] <senfood> What pissed me off the most is that the one time he could have effectively subverted expectations, by making Rey team up with Kylo and telling both the Jedi and Sith to fuck off, he doesn't do it.
[5:05:43] <%MarkSoupial> they mention fucking LIFE DAY
[5:05:49] <LordFalara> all his solo films have glaring holes
[5:05:51] <%MarkSoupial> it's star wars porn
[5:05:54] <beetbo2> wait dude
[5:05:57] <+vandesdelca0> people say TLJ is good. I can't trust anyone anymore.
[5:05:58] <MartiusGW> i cant even watch mandalorian thanks to region lock, thanks disney
[5:05:59] <beetbo2> i'd just wait
[5:05:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> sounds hawt
[5:06:00] <%MarkSoupial> it's every boba fett fanboy's wet dream
[5:06:01] <beetbo2> and see
[5:06:03] <mortelkilll> having rey and kylo team up could have been a good set up
[5:06:08] <+Manofsalt> Jon Favreau knows what he's doing
[5:06:09] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Funny enough my biggest beef with the subverting expectation and Rian is that at first it seams that he wanted to subverse said expactation into something interesting with Rey and Ren's weird connections, with Luke forsaking the jedi....But he does a triple subverting of said subversion into something super worst
[5:06:10] <ziggyjesus> Mandalorian isn't half bad
[5:06:13] <beetbo2> MACHINE GUN! :O
[5:06:13] <mortelkilll> also rey needed to be freaki nteached
[5:06:21] <Triblade1992> @PlagueOfGripes you realize that it's still confirmed Rian Johnson is still working with Lucasfilm, right? D&D was the one that was fired
[5:06:22] <mortelkilll> if not by luke, kylo coudl have worked
[5:06:29] <kiwiredgrave> Thats from battlefront 2
[5:06:33] <kiwiredgrave> THe shield gun thing
[5:06:34] <+RaikenTB> LUL
[5:06:34] <ThisGamingDragon> we'll never have the chance to get Carrie Mark and Harrison in a movie together again. Thanks Rian.
[5:06:35] <mortelkilll> aknowledge tha tshe suck at fighting
[5:06:41] <mostundesired> LUL
[5:06:44] <ahegotrigger> my favorite part is how they just murdered the big mysterious sith lord like he was nothing
[5:06:45] <SuperVaderMan> Good weapon for fighting jedi honestly. Just put a shield on a minigun LUL
[5:06:45] <+pwnjones> This game is terrible lol
[5:06:49] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why would they fire DD but keep Ryan around?
[5:06:57] <beetbo2> not against him apparently
[5:07:10] <mortelkilll> never liekd snoke but they dont have a wortwhile plot to replace him
[5:07:11] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @senfood i'm with you on that. Instead of making a new thing and having them team up. he does a triple reversal and they end up as they were before but in a cluster fuck of a narrative
[5:07:21] <+m3chamike> This game is a solid 7/10
[5:07:23] <Manjove> to be fair, JJ broke all the previous lore too
[5:07:25] <beetbo2> lol
[5:07:28] <kiwiredgrave> LUL
[5:07:31] <mostundesired> Of her own accord LUL
[5:07:32] <beetbo2> it still is
[5:07:32] <+Manofsalt> LucasFilm keeps giving Rian chances
[5:07:44] <beetbo2> She's gonna be the one teaching Rey, mark my words
[5:07:44] <LordFalara> rian killed carrie fisher like the clintons killed epstein
[5:07:45] <+nesence2> yeah was her own choices that lead to her death.
[5:07:51] <+m3chamike> To be fair everyone breaks the damn lore
[5:08:00] <%MarkSoupial> AAA issues
[5:08:01] <mortelkilll> does star wars even have lore?
[5:08:04] <beetbo2> he's waiiting
[5:08:09] <mortelkilll> seem liek even george lucas did whatever
[5:08:16] <Triblade1992> Lucasfilm doesn't like the fan theory stuff. That's why they kept with Rian. They kicked D&D because they realized how bad they were in GoT
[5:08:17] <beetbo2> what a patient man
[5:08:18] <FaultyBreaker> Look at the video game right there.
[5:08:19] <Neoripo> He was just taking a piss
[5:08:21] <Snirtax> Inoffensive is how I'd define it. It doesn't hurt the franchise any but it's nothing original
[5:08:25] <Manjove> it used to be very consistent
[5:08:25] <+m3chamike> It’s Star Wars. I love it? But it will always be dumb.
[5:08:26] <LordFalara> dude "howd you get there" is a thing in every unchartedlike and its the best and dumbest
[5:08:29] <+pwnjones> That they went into a trilogy without a plan in a multi billion dollar franchise is reason enough to fire Kennedy.
[5:08:29] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Solo is dead, Fisher is dead, Luke is dead, and all we got was one good scene in ep 8
[5:08:30] <SuperVaderMan> What an asshole LUL
[5:08:37] <ziggyjesus> Be careful, Blocking shots drains stamina
[5:08:38] <Manjove> parry with double bladed
[5:08:39] <FaultyBreaker> This is video games.
[5:08:44] <+RaikenTB> "Answer my three riddles"
[5:08:45] <kiwiredgrave> I wish there was some kind of "Saber Throw" skill
[5:08:50] <beetbo2> SECRET SKYWALKER
[5:08:53] <mortelkilll> man that would be dumb
[5:08:55] <beetbo2> what do you think of that one?
[5:08:55] <+nesence2> rey's his grand daughter.
[5:08:59] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @PlagueOfGripes who wouldn't want to fuck Monster Mash?
[5:09:09] <beetbo2> the whole secret skywalker thing, your thoughts? @PlagueOfGripes
[5:09:09] <%MarkSoupial> TLJ is on the same level for me as Phantom Menace, where there are ideas that make the cobwebs in my brain go BUT WHAT IF, but as they are are then made more disappointing than a just bad movie
[5:09:11] <Manjove> this is why TFA is bad too, Rey and Snoke broke shit
[5:09:12] <LordFalara> i cant wait to see it purely for claud the penis monster
[5:09:16] <mortelkilll> ill be honest, i hope palpatien return is a fake out
[5:09:17] <kiwiredgrave> Why are horses running on star destroyers
[5:09:20] <LordFalara> i adore the penis monster
[5:09:23] <+vandesdelca0> i'm pretty sure 9 is either going to ignore or retcon all of TLJ
[5:09:35] <+pwnjones> I think Episode 8 had two good scenes, Luke vs. the ATs and Reylo Tag Battle
[5:09:42] <+m3chamike> My favorite thing about TLJ was that Rey was a nobody who just happened to have the Force.
[5:09:55] <LordFalara> the action that isnt that throne room lightsaber scene was good in tlj
[5:10:02] <mortelkilll> yeah the obsession with lineage is so dumb
[5:10:08] <kiwiredgrave> Naruto is Japans Star Wars
[5:10:12] <Samex_Comex> But they are the special
[5:10:15] <Neoripo> @PlagueOfGripes The only thing i liked about the second movie is that Rey is a nobody, because why not? Anakin was a nobody because they found him?
[5:10:15] <kiwiredgrave> Skywalkers and Uchihas etc
[5:10:16] <beetbo2> I'd actually prefer it if they just started entirely fresh
[5:10:19] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @pwnjones you mean when Rey beats Kylo (once again) in a dick measuring contest?
[5:10:23] <beetbo2> Have a whole new story
[5:10:25] <+vandesdelca0> i thought she was just gonna have jedi parents
[5:10:25] <ziggyjesus> @LordFalara Shadiversity did a great breakdown of the throneroom fight
[5:10:27] <Manjove> they speculated about Rey was because her insane Mary Sue-ness
[5:10:28] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It's funny how Disney didn't even send any word to J.J about him not directing the Last Jedi, so muc hso that him and Simon Pegg found out only in the announcing of Rian as the new director and they were fucking pissed about it. And then Disney had to go to J.J "Okay we fucked up, here's more money now please go save us from our own mess"
[5:10:28] <Triblade1992> That's why Rian was trying to get rid of fan theories. it went out of control because of the prequels
[5:10:30] <+nesence2> yi agree, its silly, but there should be some explination of why shes so silly strong
[5:10:36] <Snirtax> A new trilogy sure would've been a good occasion to make a Jedi that's not anything like Luke
[5:10:37] <Kolpax619> and the complain about them linking back to things they already saw
[5:10:38] <beetbo2> I mean, you can still have the jedi and shit, but no ties to Skywalker
[5:10:47] <mostundesired> You could say that at least TLJ burned off all the bad ideas... along with the good ones.
[5:10:47] <%MarkSoupial> back in the day James Earl Jones thought Vader was lying to Luke about being his father just to get him to turn and I SO MUCH wanted that to be canon
[5:10:49] <mortelkilll> cant the force just be random?
[5:10:50] <LordFalara> thats why i liked the old books and games, entirely isolated stories across the galaxy, fuck yes, gove me more of that
[5:10:51] <beetbo2> set it far in the future
[5:10:52] <Manjove> this is why i dont give Disney any credit
[5:11:04] <conservativerk> Hi :)
[5:11:05] <mortelkilll> the force just make peopel randomyl strogner, dotn need no stupid lineage
[5:11:09] <%MarkSoupial> like imagine the misdirect of the prequels where anakin isn't luke's father
[5:11:10] <Triblade1992> THey could have explained it as her being a student of Luke Skywalker without giving into fan theories
[5:11:11] <ThisGamingDragon> It would actually makes sense at this point since she's OP without training
[5:11:11] <SuperVaderMan> Rey is such a nothing character
[5:11:11] <+nesence2> oh yes you could
[5:11:13] <mcexcadrill> finn should've been the jedi
[5:11:16] <mortelkilll> yeah rey a weak point of these movies, they do nothign wit hher
[5:11:23] <+pwnjones> I wish they would make Rey expend effort to lift rocks with the force
[5:11:26] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> but that's sexist!
[5:11:26] <mortelkilll> sadly, kinda
[5:11:30] <Snirtax> Luke clutches the endgame
[5:11:32] <%MarkSoupial> luke was already a good pilot
[5:11:32] <+Tevvy> i was gonna say, luke didnt do much either
[5:11:40] <mortelkilll> the real sexist are the people not using rey for anythign of substance
[5:11:43] <+vandesdelca0> luke exists because that type of character was just a thing back then
[5:11:53] <+Manofsalt> Luke wanted adventure. He got it.
[5:11:53] <beetbo2> but at LEAST there was an arc to Luke
[5:11:54] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:11:56] <+nesence2> yeah the only film you NEED him for is 6
[5:12:00] <beetbo2> some believable growth
[5:12:02] <SuperVaderMan> Luke is just a guy. But at least his feats feel earned
[5:12:03] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> not everyone sucked Luke off, and he was only good at piloting
[5:12:03] <mostundesired> I dunno, Luke did some things that only work because he's Luke.
[5:12:07] <mortelkilll> luke started as a generic hero which is shoved intot the story
[5:12:14] <FaultyBreaker> I mean, Luke's whole role when you boil it down was to just be the catalyst for Vader's redemption.
[5:12:15] <mortelkilll> he got better in 5 and 6 at least
[5:12:25] <+RaikenTB> A New Hope was at least made as a complete movie.
[5:12:30] <Snirtax> To be fair, that doesn't excuse what they did with Ray
[5:12:34] <%MarkSoupial> luke was the vessel to teach the audience about the force
[5:12:36] <LordFalara> @plagueofgripes luke takes the initiative to go with obiwan to train, he just gets unlucky in that his master gets axed immediately, he has agency and established piloting skills for episode 4, for episode 5 and 6 he goes through the heroes journey
[5:12:37] <sircool099> luke is needed in 4 to blow up death star. he's needed in 5 so that not everyone is frozen.
[5:12:42] <mortelkilll> yeah, just sayign rey wasnt doomed fro mthe start
[5:12:44] <conservativerk> The biggest problem I have with modern Star Wars is that Disney seem to have done away with the idea of heredity - now anyone and everyone can be a Jedi. I don't like that at all...
[5:12:45] <Frog_of_Justic> He was going to Toshi Station, to pick up some power converters
[5:12:46] <mortelkilll> but not, not much hope
[5:12:55] <Neoripo> Dark souls 2 trap
[5:13:06] <+m3chamike> Wait did you see that in canon Rey becomes stronger because since the Dark Side is so strong through Kylo Ren and monster face that the Light Side just made her stronger. I believe it’s canon now.
[5:13:10] <+pwnjones> All modern movies and most modern games are pretty bad.
[5:13:10] <beetbo2> @Frog_of_Justic imagine if the entire franchise was just a big quest to pick up power converters
[5:13:10] <morcego_cinzento_arts> kinda ironic really. the prequel treated Anakin/Vader as space christ when he was just one important character in a story with multiple important characters. Now we got a new obsession with his bloodline
[5:13:11] <mortelkilll> i dont really liek star wars lore, its a pretty dumb setting
[5:13:11] <Triblade1992> That's better than "You are connected to 1 of THREE BLOODLINES!"
[5:13:11] <%MarkSoupial> yup
[5:13:22] <mortelkilll> and yeah the stories were never that good despite the movies being fun
[5:13:23] <beetbo2> It was very much saved in the editing bay
[5:13:26] <mortelkilll> its ultra simplistic
[5:13:29] <mostundesired> You're not wrong, but it was executed fairly well. Fairly.
[5:13:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> can you fuck a force ghost?
[5:13:32] <+vandesdelca0> it's dumb space high fantasy. it's mostly just supposed to be fun.
[5:13:37] <+CatGuyPerson> Fuck, I mean yo.
[5:13:38] <Triblade1992> It worked well with luke and vader and then went completely out of control with the prequels
[5:13:43] <dowmein> When do you think they'll bring back Dexter Jetster?
[5:13:46] <+Manofsalt> It's a classic romp
[5:13:50] <+pwnjones> Can you force a fuck ghost?
[5:13:54] <LordFalara> the original trilogy was a mostly comperent heroes journey space opera
[5:13:56] <beetbo2> It only worked becuase of the filmmaking
[5:13:59] <beetbo2> and the editing
[5:13:59] <%MarkSoupial> star wars is the embodiment of "dazzle them with the basics"
[5:14:00] <+nesence2> simple isn't bad.
[5:14:01] <Snirtax> Star wars is just like Harry Potter to me, cool concepts that are used terribly. Original trilogy nothwithstanding
[5:14:05] <ThisGamingDragon> The 1st movie would've sucked if the sequels didn't happen
[5:14:05] <mortelkilll> to be fair the movies didnt need to be complex, they were fun
[5:14:12] <FaultyBreaker> Simple is fine when done well.
[5:14:15] <sircool099> imagine a storyline is constantly about one family in particular. Sure, spin-offs or off-shoots in universe were about other things and world building. But the main core portion is about one family. Then it suddenly isn't.
[5:14:15] <beetbo2> becuase finn
[5:14:18] <jiin6> ghosts
[5:14:18] <beetbo2> ?
[5:14:20] <LordFalara> star wars then grew huge and had an expanded universe full of fantastic shit and stupid shit
[5:14:29] <Triblade1992> Star Wars was banned from China for 20 years though?
[5:14:42] <beetbo2> ahhhh
[5:14:47] <beetbo2> no nostalgia baiting China
[5:14:48] <SuperVaderMan> Star wars was never a revolution in china
[5:15:08] <LordFalara> china also really only has interest if you cater directly to china and include china locales
[5:15:10] <mortelkilll> its a fu nromp, not quite nothing
[5:15:11] <+RaikenTB> 9 won't have force ghosts then. Not allowed in China.
[5:15:12] <+Tevvy> yeah, ironically star wars is as big as it was due to what people deride a lot of movies for nowadays.
[5:15:15] <mostundesired> Bit reductive, but you're not wrong.
[5:15:18] <Snirtax> So what you're saying is that Star Wars is the Avatar of its time
[5:15:26] <mortelkilll> pretty much
[5:15:29] <Manjove> Simple can still be great if its well written
[5:15:32] <kiwiredgrave> god this dialogue...
[5:15:32] <LordFalara> no because star wars is good
[5:15:39] <beetbo2> oof
[5:15:40] <mostundesired> Oof
[5:15:43] <beetbo2> yeah
[5:15:44] <morcego_cinzento_arts> the Chinese people are so feed up with some of the stuff that Disney and others are doing in their current movies(pandering and such) that they are giving Disney the nick name "white left"
[5:15:45] <beetbo2> not great
[5:15:46] <sircool099> prequels > sequels
[5:15:47] <+nesence2> ppoor bastards...
[5:15:55] <Presence_Eternal> I've read Kung Fu Panda didn't smash records in China in spite of being a fairly competent retelling of existing Chinese stories. Depending on personal taste of course.
[5:15:58] <mostundesired> Big oof
[5:15:58] <LordFalara> the prequels got saved by side content
[5:15:59] <cerazor01> Actually the first time China was introduced to the Star Wars series was a bunch of heavily edited Comics
[5:16:06] <Triblade1992> The bootlegs of the OT were sold and it was hilarious
[5:16:14] <LordFalara> the sequels have basically no side content and bad writers everywhere
[5:16:17] <+m3chamike> @sircool099 have you watched the prequels lately?
[5:16:25] <otakon17> can we get a "whiffed jump" counter going?
[5:16:28] <Manjove> no main content either
[5:16:33] <%MarkSoupial> the prequels were saved by dummos who like 40 minute lava fight
[5:16:33] <otakon17> I think the platforming has killed Plague more than anything else
[5:16:34] <mortelkilll> people get attached
[5:16:34] <beetbo2> becuase Nostalgia
[5:16:35] <Triblade1992> America, Europe and Japan
[5:16:39] <Snirtax> To be fair original Star Wars is way better than Avatar, but it's pretty similar when you think about it. Both were sold on technology instead of substance
[5:16:41] <+Manofsalt> China supoorted some really terrible movies though
[5:16:45] <beetbo2> we want something they're not going to give us
[5:16:51] <conservativerk> Does anyone consider that overt feminism is perhaps ruining Star Wars? I mean...without getting into politics, it does shove the wokeness down your throat with the current crop of movies.
[5:16:58] <mortelkilll> meh not really
[5:16:59] <%MarkSoupial> my childhood star wars was a vhs copy off tv for RoTJ
[5:17:00] <+Tevvy> hey look a dead space mechanic
[5:17:03] <dowmein> gameplay(?)
[5:17:06] <jiin6> Dumb scifi pistons
[5:17:07] <+RaikenTB> Look at this machine porn.
[5:17:15] <LordFalara> a standered story done well is a good story
[5:17:16] <mortelkilll> but bad identity politic is allowing bad writers to cover for bad writign o ntheir female characters
[5:17:17] <sircool099> I have, prequels have something of a writing about it of people kinda wanting to be there. at least every scene is needed no matter how dumb. Sequels have whole scenes that can be deleted and nothing changes
[5:17:22] <morcego_cinzento_arts> this right nopw reminds me of when you needed to slow machinery with stasis in Dead Space games
[5:17:30] <conservativerk> What mortelkill said
[5:17:38] <%MarkSoupial> it's the Sonic problem, where sonic has never been THAT good
[5:17:43] <+superc37> hey the gendy cartoon were p goddamn good
[5:17:45] <%MarkSoupial> but SOME people are REALLY into it
[5:17:47] <senfood> This reminds me that I need too get around to watching Clone Wars.
[5:17:49] <+superc37> and kotor
[5:17:49] <+vectorless_peon> The Wokeness is a major driving issue but we're looking more at symptoms than cause
[5:17:51] <LordFalara> sonic 2 and 3 were good ass platformers
[5:17:55] <%MarkSoupial> and it makes money and is highly markettable
[5:18:03] <Triblade1992> This is why I hate how the fan theories have gone out of control. It's pretty much the reason why Rian Johnson did what he did.
[5:18:05] <dowmein> {game[play(?]}
[5:18:13] <mortelkilll> we shoudl strive to encourage peopel to make mai ncharacters that arent straight cis white males but they also should be people that want to make good stuff
[5:18:21] <LordFalara> rian did what he did because hes a mongoloid idiot hack writer
[5:18:26] <conservativerk> I'm all for a strong female character, but they created one that became insanely strong quickly, and turned all the lore on its head with her.
[5:18:36] <+vandesdelca0> identity politics is ruining a lot of things because it makes people stop focusing on actually making something
[5:18:40] <mortelkilll> currently creators do feel contrivved that peopel wont like their product if their hero isnt the straight cis white male and tahts a problem
[5:18:41] <LordFalara> they didnt make a strong female charecter
[5:18:48] <Snirtax> When will western devs stop poorly stapling five different games together, slapping an old license on it and calling it a day? Seriously there's nothing original about this game
[5:18:49] <mortelkilll> yeah rey not a strong one
[5:18:53] <thwak> is this game running on frostbyte?
[5:18:54] <+m3chamike> @sircool099 you are nuts. Most of the scenes in the prequels could be cut out and you’d lose nothing. Not to mention it actively hurt things in the universe. That doesn’t happen much with the sequels.
[5:19:01] <Neoripo> I am happy that Titanfall parkour is kinda safe
[5:19:03] <beetbo2> @conservativerk @vandesdelca0 the thing about female characters taht are strong is that they have to be CHARACTERS first
[5:19:08] <mortelkilll> ironically, to make a storng character yo ugotta make them kinda bad people
[5:19:09] <LordFalara> rey isnt a strong female charecter, shes a vagina having charecter that has no flaws
[5:19:13] <+vectorless_peon> good characters come from good writing and thy donthave that in hollywood right now
[5:19:19] <mortelkilll> so you have stuff to work in their story
[5:19:34] <mortelkilll> and yeah if you give layers to yoru characters they re gonan be backlashed
[5:19:44] <conservativerk> This is the issue...everyone keeps banging on about 'white males', all the damned time. I find it offensive and me and my friends and family are getting sick of it.
[5:19:46] <beetbo2> like
[5:19:51] <Snirtax> Characters like Rey are bad because they can't have flaws. The brownie points won't allow it. Problem is perfect people make for absolute shit characters
[5:19:52] <Neoripo> Just make a good movie!
[5:19:54] <ThisGamingDragon> I'm tired of the "nostalgia pandering" talk. Like, that's Star Wars identity. You can't change that.
[5:19:55] <beetbo2> it doesn't matter if its woke, just that if it's GOOD
[5:20:00] <sircool099> you can't even cut the scene in the diner that's super dumb cause that's how obi-wan learns of the clone world. You can cut the entire scene in the prequels of the giant squid attack or literally everything of the casino planet, and it'd effect nothing
[5:20:03] <beetbo2> it should be GOOD first
[5:20:06] <beetbo2> woke second
[5:20:08] <%MarkSoupial> that's two sided, either WHY THEY BLACK or WHY THEY NOT BLACK
[5:20:12] <%MarkSoupial> and it's very loud
[5:20:12] <Manjove> YUP
[5:20:13] <beetbo2> this shouldn't be hard
[5:20:15] <thwak> I mean china doesn't want a back man to date an asian woman
[5:20:25] <sircool099> EVERY scene of the prequels is needed and has a place that continues the plot, no matter how dumb.
[5:20:26] <+RaikenTB> This is why enemies in Souls game shouldn't talk.
[5:20:39] <+vandesdelca0> the prequels are dumb and boring, but they're nothing if not DENSE
[5:20:46] <ziggyjesus> "broken branch, ancestor cry" in the words of weihan zhang
[5:20:50] <%MarkSoupial> every scene
[5:20:52] <beetbo2> like they're doing for Star Wars now?
[5:20:52] <conservativerk> I liked the Hans Solo movie because of the female character - she was pretty cool, flawed and a 'strong female'. Haven't watched in in a while, so I can't remember the details.
[5:20:54] <%MarkSoupial> is just so dense
[5:20:54] <Snirtax> Hey, here's an idea. Don't care about race or sex, just make good characters that make sense
[5:20:57] <mortelkilll> just sayign there is a major issue of erasure i nmedia and it should be adressed
[5:21:00] <Manjove> Star Wars had the market, they just need to make something that isnt terrible
[5:21:03] <mostundesired> Because they're dumb!
[5:21:05] <%MarkSoupial> there's SO MUCH going on
[5:21:08] <Triblade1992> The problem is that the fanbase learned a lot of bad lessons from the prequels with their 'connect everything to everything' mentality
[5:21:12] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @conservativerk @mortelkilll on that subject i noticed that a lot of old school filmakers and writters are also going on the woke trend. Like Tim Miller with the latest terminator and one rater passive aggressive remark of his that anyone that didn't like a certain character in the movie are misogynistic jocks. It's like they want in that trend cause tehy think that will make money or maybe some of them feel like they are being pressured into going that route do to heavy backlash
[5:21:13] <Huntercd> Is Yong Bosch doing storm trooper voices?
[5:21:14] <Professor_Malice> rev up them Joe Camels
[5:21:18] <sircool099> there's no meat, no build up, no nothing in the sequels. the most bare bones. Like some one who heard of star wars through a friend who told them about star wars is writing it
[5:21:35] <+TheSaintJohn> what your saying is they should bring back JarJar with a cape?
[5:21:41] <+vectorless_peon> Starwars has a good settings and asthetics but the writing is almost always silly or bad or simpleespecially outside of the origenal trilogy
[5:21:42] <LordFalara> thats why im liking fallen order, its a star wars game, i wanted a star wars game with a star wars plot and im getting that
[5:21:50] <+m3chamike> @sircool099 dude, you can cut the entirety of episode 1 and lose literally nothing. The diner scene doesn’t need to be there either, it doesn’t do anything that an offhanded comment could do.
[5:21:52] <dowmein> what even is this place
[5:21:54] <LordFalara> i want STAR WARS, to BE STAR WARS
[5:21:56] <mortelkilll> @morcego_cinzento_arts yeah, quite a lot of trend rider without any real intent to their characters, it really hurt the cause and convince a lot of actual sexist/racist tha tthey are right
[5:22:04] <beetbo2> something something comics
[5:22:05] <DragonBornKing> people writing a novel in this chat lmao
[5:22:06] <ziggyjesus> Kids and nostalgia
[5:22:13] <mortelkilll> personally i do thign there is a major problem of a lack of diversity in media
[5:22:14] <+vandesdelca0> dude episode 1 is the most important film in the prequels
[5:22:21] <Manjove> Rey doesnt get that
[5:22:24] <mortelkilll> and people need to be encouraged to experiment and research
[5:22:25] <beetbo2> or Harry Potter
[5:22:30] <beetbo2> HARRY POTTER
[5:22:32] <beetbo2> !
[5:22:35] <sircool099> you can't cause the first episode gets anakin out of slavery and obi-wans apprentice, padame's rise in politics from her spot as queen, and seeds of the clone wars
[5:22:42] <%MarkSoupial> they tried for one scene
[5:22:46] <Snirtax> Propaganda radicalizes. But it does so on both sides. That's why you don't want to force ideology through culture.
[5:22:47] <mortelkilll> encouraging peopel to diversify is not the same as pandering and we should be able to tel lthe difference whci hpeopel often dont
[5:22:50] <%MarkSoupial> the "it's not a power you have" scene
[5:22:59] <ThisGamingDragon> @vectorless_peon that's why you should never make a Star Wars movie outside of the original trilogy or at least that was pathetic cuz that's the identity of the franchise.
[5:23:00] <%MarkSoupial> but then nothing happened
[5:23:00] <beetbo2> it's the GROWTH
[5:23:02] <beetbo2> the JOURNEY
[5:23:12] <Snirtax> If you diversify for the sake of diversifying then you're doing it wrong.
[5:23:16] <beetbo2> the EXPLORATION of world, characters, and fun shit
[5:23:22] <Mrhuggles> i think you mean world building, not growth.
[5:23:27] <conservativerk> It's like...there are plenty of good films out there with strong females. I watched Ocean's 8 a couple of years ago, I really liked it. But, news flash, feminism is actually unpopular across all demographics, and the idea of 'smashing the patriarchy' is just getting on people's nerves - especially as it seems to be with every other movie, comic, videogame, etc
[5:23:31] <SuperVaderMan> remember when Rey just mind tricked some guy out of nowhere, with no set up
[5:23:32] <ThisGamingDragon> aesthetic not pathetic
[5:23:36] <mortelkilll> diversifying abotu trying to see more perspectives and more aspect of the world you live in or have created
[5:23:37] <+m3chamike> @sircool099 none of those things are important enough that need to be shown. All of those things could’ve been told to you in the first five minutes
[5:23:39] <Huntercd> The one cool thing of stopping laser shot never happened again
[5:23:43] <beetbo2> @Mrhuggles I mean growth of character, the arcs they grow trough
[5:23:45] <beetbo2> through
[5:23:53] <Neoripo> We need puppet yoda beating adults back
[5:23:55] <mortelkilll> diversifyign should be a natural process, not a forced one
[5:23:55] <Triblade1992> TLJ had the KOTOR 2 clip notes version of it with Luke and Rey
[5:24:04] <ziggyjesus> I honest;y don't think kids care about establishing powers, they just wanna see cool stuff
[5:24:08] <+vandesdelca0> and teaching us about the horrors of slavery
[5:24:13] <LordFalara> TLJ wanted to be kotor 2 so badly
[5:24:16] <sircool099> they literally aren't though.
[5:24:17] <ziggyjesus> Big battles and stuff
[5:24:22] <beetbo2> They don't understand what brings people to this setting ASIDE from Nostalgia
[5:24:24] <Manjove> remember how Iron Man was for kids?
[5:24:29] <%MarkSoupial> HUMAN, do not produce light here
[5:24:31] <sircool099> they're literally setting blocks of foundation for the entire storyline.
[5:24:36] <senfood> I've seen both new movies and I really don't understand why Porgs became their big marketing mascot. Who the fuck cares about Porgs?
[5:24:46] <beetbo2> kids
[5:24:46] <%MarkSoupial> klaigePorg
[5:24:47] <+Tevvy> kids do
[5:24:47] <LordFalara> idiots
[5:24:49] <beetbo2> becuase they're cute
[5:24:51] <beetbo2> kids
[5:24:53] <beetbo2> and idiots
[5:24:54] <conservativerk> @mortelkilll Diversifying for the sake of diversifying is a big mistake. People should be focusing on merit character development and story first and foremost.
[5:24:54] <ThisGamingDragon> Star Wars has always seemed like a Disney franchise to me. Which is ironic since the Disney movies don't feel like Star Wars.
[5:24:59] <+CatGuyPerson> Super Heroes and Fortnite
[5:25:02] <senfood> Are they cute? They just seem like nothing creatures.
[5:25:04] <%Rezca> is this the reason why I can only watch gundam series every other series?
[5:25:05] <beetbo2> WHY DO PEOPLE FORGET
[5:25:05] <+nesence2> porgs are there to get the idiots
[5:25:08] <beetbo2> MARVEL HAD A PLAN
[5:25:12] <beetbo2> IT HAD A PLAN!
[5:25:12] <+vandesdelca0> porgs are cute. i hate it, but they are.
[5:25:13] <%MarkSoupial> porgs exist because they didn't want to cgi out the native birds on that island
[5:25:15] <jiin6> movies yes, comics...eh...
[5:25:25] <Triblade1992> Porgs are just a new ewok but without the thinly veiled allegory for Vietcong @senfood
[5:25:33] <%MarkSoupial> yeah iron man was marvel's final fantasy
[5:25:38] <+Tevvy> the chasing economic market is a waaay bigger thing than the wokeness
[5:25:38] <morcego_cinzento_arts> @conservativerk funny enough you mentioned Ocean's 8. Cause three of the actresses did go on the browny points and blamed some of the crtitisms and some people not liking the movie as misogynists. So even when people find the movie good, some of the people that made it still use that woke tactics of shaming you into liking their movie
[5:25:38] <Triblade1992> which I consider it better
[5:25:40] <+vandesdelca0> people should be talking about those crystal foxes honestly
[5:25:42] <kiwiredgrave> comics are dying superheros are thriving
[5:25:43] <senfood> But the Vietcong allegory was what made it FUN!
[5:25:43] <beetbo2> and look how well that turned out @PlagueOfGripes
[5:25:43] <%MarkSoupial> the all in one shot that was ride or die for the company
[5:25:47] <beetbo2> China put a curfew
[5:26:14] <Mrhuggles> Disney has said multiple times they don't understand star wars. That's why they trust others on their payroll to handle things.
[5:26:22] <Mrhuggles> It's just an i.p. for them.
[5:26:24] <conservativerk> The problem is China isn't woke, yet.
[5:26:26] <conservativerk> XD
[5:26:30] <beetbo2> ^
[5:26:41] <beetbo2> They're one of the least woke
[5:26:42] <Manjove> Marvel did it because they wanted to make a good movie first
[5:26:51] <beetbo2> It's becuase they had a PLAN
[5:26:51] <%MarkSoupial> is it the controller he feels pulling him?
[5:26:52] <+vandesdelca0> the funny thing is marvel only worked because it started before it was a huge franchise. it's clearly falling about now.
[5:26:56] <%MarkSoupial> or the quest marker
[5:27:04] <beetbo2> and someone who knew what he was doing leading the way
[5:27:09] <DragonBornKing> im enjoying the mandalorian so far
[5:27:12] <beetbo2> there was a VISION
[5:27:13] <Triblade1992> Eh, Disney was doing that in the 90's too. Eisenhower was like "We are here to make money first. If we make a good movie, then that's just a bonus". And that was during the RENESCANCE era
[5:27:22] <sircool099> fortnite did it to PUBG
[5:27:23] <jiin6> But the demographic
[5:27:25] <beetbo2> Like, hate the prequels all you want
[5:27:31] <beetbo2> but GEORGE had a VISION
[5:27:33] <beetbo2> a PLAN
[5:27:38] <beetbo2> A story TO TELL
[5:27:45] <beetbo2> even if it was trash
[5:27:46] <ThisGamingDragon> I don't think Marvel is ad amazing as everyone says it is. Just the Russo's made the good movies.
[5:27:48] <Triblade1992> Nah, George just wanted to sell toys Beetbot
[5:27:58] <jiin6> stick to the plan, chase the market pvpPlan
[5:27:59] <%MarkSoupial> econ 101 is that public information cannot beat the market
[5:28:00] <sircool099> FORTNITE MARKET CHASED PUBG AND BEAT THEM BAD
[5:28:09] <LordFalara> the prequels are bad movies, however, their still star wars movies, their just bland, they got saved by various writers and videogames of the time using the ideas from the prequels
[5:28:10] <mostundesired> You have to lick the market! You have to date the market! You have to BE the market!
[5:28:12] <Triblade1992> I only find the sequels entertaining
[5:28:18] <%MarkSoupial> oh lord star trek
[5:28:25] <jiin6> oh star trek
[5:28:34] <Mrhuggles> "You have to make the market, not steal it." - Why does Epic Game Store come to mind?
[5:28:36] <%MarkSoupial> and picard is ANOTHER action series and not old picard being old picard
[5:28:39] <+Tevvy> star trek has it way worse than star wars lol
[5:28:41] <conservativerk> Heck, who remembers Xena: Warrior Princess? (TV). It was bloody brilliant. I don't see what hollywood/disney/media is talking about with all this, what they seem to be after was already there.
[5:28:41] <beetbo2> God, you're right
[5:28:47] <+m3chamike> @beetbo2 no he didn’t he was totally there to make money first you can look it up.
[5:28:50] <LordFalara> we get episode 1, qui gon and obiwan could be interesting, but arnt in the movie, so we get a 40 book run of obi wan and qui gon meeting and adventures for teens
[5:28:50] <DragonBornKing> @sircool099 pubg was a very popular game but it was done very poorly and the market was itching for a better replacement and epic did it and made it F2P
[5:28:52] <beetbo2> it's like the sins of Star Trek infected Star wars
[5:29:01] <+vandesdelca0> because epic has assloads of chinese money to throw around
[5:29:01] <%Rezca> did Battlestar Gallactica make a comeback?
[5:29:03] <%MarkSoupial> remember seven of nine? PICARD
[5:29:05] <%MarkSoupial> PLEASE CLAP
[5:29:07] <Mrhuggles> RIP Nature
[5:29:10] <LordFalara> THAT IS WHY STAR WARS SURVIVED THE PREQUELS
[5:29:14] <beetbo2> @m3chamike If that's the case, then Marvel or the OG Harry Potter series is a better example
[5:29:16] <ThisGamingDragon> there's a way to make Star Trek action-y while keeping the heart of the Original Series. But they didn't do it right.
[5:29:24] <LordFalara> we had SHITLOADS of other media for star wars that was good
[5:29:25] <beetbo2> you TELL A STORY and SELL a PRODUCT
[5:29:29] <kiwiredgrave> local JEDI goes around slaughtering wildlife
[5:29:30] <beetbo2> you have to do BOTH
[5:29:35] <DragonBornKing> no shit lmao
[5:29:47] <%MarkSoupial> i was literally about to type magic supergenius
[5:29:53] <+nesence2> they are idiots with a lot of money.
[5:29:57] <+CatGuyPerson> Entitlement
[5:29:59] <senfood> Most executives are normal people with psychopathic tendencies.
[5:30:04] <beetbo2> Have you ever had the feeling that
[5:30:04] <jiin6> and they snorted the cocaine
[5:30:10] <+vandesdelca0> people assume that rich = genius for some rason
[5:30:15] <beetbo2> god
[5:30:22] <beetbo2> yeah, you're right
[5:30:23] <mortelkilll> to be rich , al lyou need is money
[5:30:35] <+nesence2> id burn the company down, collect the insurance, then get the hell out of hollywood.
[5:30:35] <mortelkilll> most of the top job hire on beign rich, not talent
[5:30:45] <mortelkilll> whic his so dumb
[5:30:51] <+CatGuyPerson> Just steal a quarter from every person and you'll probably be rich
[5:30:54] <ThisGamingDragon> I've never understood the whole "we can't make it like the source material, because it wouldn't translate well to film" argument.
[5:31:00] <beetbo2> heal!
[5:31:02] <beetbo2> :O
[5:31:06] <otakon17> THE WALL GOATS
[5:31:11] <otakon17> HEAL
[5:31:12] <Mrhuggles> Score: Nature 2; Humanity 0
[5:31:14] <kiwiredgrave> the Virgin Jedi vs the chad goat
[5:31:20] <beetbo2> Pat died several times to just a goat
[5:31:23] <Triblade1992> Certain things have to be changed when transitioning from book to movie though
[5:31:27] <%MarkSoupial> yeah it's really easy to take other people's money, it all depends on how bad you can handle feeling
[5:31:29] <morcego_cinzento_arts> goat simulator, star wars edition
[5:31:30] <Triblade1992> different mediums and all that
[5:31:32] <jiin6> EA and glitching is the norm
[5:31:36] <%MarkSoupial> if you just dont give ANY shits, you're golden
[5:31:37] <otakon17> so you can't kick while double saber'ing?
[5:31:43] <mortelkilll> @ThisGamingDragon different mediums have different strenghts and tryign to make an adaptation too faithful will make you lose the strenght of one withotu gainign the strenghts of the other
[5:31:44] <conservativerk> I often assumed that creative types are going to be easy to influence and control by others. Generally speaking my experience of directors, artists, animators, etc want to be left alone to their work. So that's probably another problem?
[5:31:52] <+sourceofall> oh star wars rpg mechanics, just ignoring how lightsabers work
[5:31:57] <ThisGamingDragon> @triblade1992 I don't see what you have to change. it's literally written for you.
[5:31:58] <@Nightbot> Plague is a youtube animator and also streams at https://picarto.tv/Plague . Also: t-shirts! http://goo.gl/lze8QO
[5:32:00] <Samex_Comex> Damn goats Muriel has a bad back and needs the hot spring
[5:32:28] <sircool099> and that's how you get a Death Stranding
[5:32:30] <beetbo2> yeah, maybe heal. cuz they hit big
[5:32:34] <kiwiredgrave> Goats are the true enemy of the Jedi
[5:32:43] <jiin6> saber throw would be so useful
[5:32:45] <Heartless_01> lol
[5:32:52] <mortelkilll> goats are the true masters of the dark side
[5:32:57] <Lenmutt> How are you likeing Jedi souls? Pat hated the goats.
[5:32:58] <Triblade1992> @ThisGamingDragon Because it might not come out the way it should. Lord of the Rings made changes in the movies (like cutting the Hobbit Shire being turned into an allegory for capitalism in the third book)
[5:32:59] <%MarkSoupial> death stranding is like if kojima HAD mad metal gear survive
[5:33:06] <%MarkSoupial> made
[5:33:33] <sircool099> oh god you might be right
[5:33:37] <LordFalara> death stranding makes me wonder if kojima was only good because he had a few chains on him for mgs 1 to 4
[5:33:43] <Wordless1412> lmao
[5:33:44] <beetbo2> ^
[5:33:46] <ThisGamingDragon> @triblade1992 Well I think they could've kept that and nothing would be worse for wear
[5:33:49] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Now i remember Mike from RLM saying that STD is the producers show, cause they like 27 producers in the opening credits. I guess lots of executive and producers bean counters are that desperate to be recognized
[5:33:49] <+CatGuyPerson> Baaaaaaah
[5:34:00] <beetbo2> what makes geniuses work is SOME limitations
[5:34:08] <ThisGamingDragon> Nice Woolie impression
[5:34:08] <Triblade1992> @ThisGamingDragon that part was pointless and dumb. It doesn't work with the narrative
[5:34:09] <+m3chamike> Death Stranding is like if Kojima made S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[5:34:10] <SuperVaderMan> I love the absolute disdain for these stupid goats LUL
[5:34:17] <Samex_Comex> Beep beep
[5:34:31] <sircool099> Confirmed: Plague's farm is not a goat farm
[5:34:34] <LordFalara> i think one of the only times i got angry at RLM is when theu said star wars cant be expanded on, when the best stories in star wars is in the fucking expanded universe
[5:34:43] <Heartless_01> LUL
[5:34:44] <beetbo2> and that's why, for however unique and creative Death Stranding is, it'll still be flawed
[5:34:50] <Lenmutt> Damn you'd think they were dragons the way Eli is shit talkin them.
[5:34:53] <otakon17> anger goats
[5:34:57] <Triblade1992> They never read the Thrawn Trilogy @LordFalara that's the sad part.
[5:34:58] <Mrhuggles> remember when you were an apprentice to darth vadar and you could just throw people off cliffs with the force? - Peperage Farm remembers.
[5:35:05] <LordFalara> plague and disdain for random shit is the best
[5:35:11] <Triblade1992> It's also because the fan theories that went wild
[5:35:11] <beetbo2> becuase there was no real chains, even if it was JUST one
[5:35:12] <LordPubious> you cut its horn off, now it will never attract a mate
[5:35:20] <ziggyjesus> I really hate how you can only get 3 hits in before the enemy decides "Ok, now I get a turn to hit" right in the middle of your combo
[5:35:27] <DragonBornKing> @LordFalara i had the same reaction. first time i was ever annoyed at something they said
[5:35:37] <sircool099> Force unleashed is "what if a high level wizzard went nuts?" Fallen Order is "what if a low level warrior tried to rebuild his order?"
[5:35:39] <%MarkSoupial> klaigeWmage
[5:35:42] <beetbo2> ^
[5:35:46] <bevyrage> @ziggyjesus yeah it's like a reverse poise mechanic
[5:35:52] <beetbo2> wizard bdsm?
[5:35:56] <%MarkSoupial> so Naruto?
[5:36:07] <LordPubious> lovecraftian mind breaking pain
[5:36:14] <%Rezca> sounds like a Punisher thing
[5:36:17] <ahegotrigger> so youre thinking about Hell
[5:36:17] <beetbo2> so I have no mouth, yet I must scream?
[5:36:20] <beetbo2> but wizards?
[5:36:23] <%MarkSoupial> genjutsu but in real time
[5:36:25] <fatty_rangel> plague of tripes
[5:36:29] <Heartless_01> damn
[5:36:33] <ThisGamingDragon> what is this again?
[5:36:39] <Paralurx> endless AND unending?
[5:36:44] <Jrockoni> .....man Plague really hates goats huh
[5:36:49] <Samex_Comex> Dont fuck with that wizard
[5:36:54] <ziggyjesus> Thats actually a part of Dan Simmons novel "Hyperion" except for 7 years and he's not really an asshole
[5:37:02] <%Rezca> force lightning?
[5:37:02] <Kurudan> kurama did something like that in Yuyu Hakusho. but it was justified
[5:37:04] <beetbo2> @PlagueOfGripes do you think this is why goats often represent satan?
[5:37:12] <sircool099> So would you say.....these goats got your goat?
[5:37:18] <ThisGamingDragon> I like the Dr. Manhattan explosion myself
[5:37:22] <LordFalara> future star wars movies should be like, stormtrooper organizes a coup on a star destroyer, theres your fucking movie
[5:37:24] <ziggyjesus> He gets infected with a parasite and has to electrecute himself for 7 years
[5:37:33] <dowmein> when will dexter jetster come back as the force awakened?
[5:37:40] <LordFalara> a trio of charecters goes to rob a hutts casino
[5:37:41] <dowmein> and have a fight scene like yoda
[5:37:42] <mortelkilll> i dont like killing annoying people, death mean they dont get to regret what they did
[5:37:42] <beetbo2> no
[5:37:45] <beetbo2> headbutt.webm
[5:37:51] <beetbo2> like a true jerk
[5:37:54] <SuperVaderMan> Plague is a model jedi. "I looove killing these pieces of shit"
[5:37:59] <conservativerk> I am getting the impression this guy doesn't like hard-headed types.
[5:37:59] <+vandesdelca0> it's very cathartic
[5:38:01] <sircool099> I think the hutt heist was a episode in clone wars actually
[5:38:03] <bevyrage> i hope there's a goat boss at the end of the game
[5:38:13] <bevyrage> like this was some sort of nemesis system the entire time
[5:38:26] <LordFalara> modern star wars needs a series of side stories to refill the world building because those three movies didnt do it
[5:38:33] <ThisGamingDragon> I want asshole Jedi roaming the world.
[5:38:46] <LordFalara> THE GOAT COMES OUT AND ITS HORN IS A HORNSABER
[5:38:50] <mortelkilll> sometiem you jsut wanna be really pissed
[5:38:53] <Paralurx> Can't wait for the twist in Episode 9 where it turns out Emperor Palpatine was 2 goats in a trenchcoat the whole time
[5:38:54] <Triblade1992> lol
[5:38:56] <beetbo2> goat's were asking for it
[5:38:58] <mortelkilll> being pissed is kind of fun
[5:38:58] <LordPubious> an Anthology movie or something
[5:39:03] <sircool099> PLAGUE "SMOTE THE GOAT" OF GRIPES
[5:39:04] <LordPubious> 4 short stories set in the universe
[5:39:05] <conservativerk> @LordFalara It needs to be given to Japan so they can revitalise it and the current mess needs an obliteration button.
[5:39:09] <AntChodeny> @ThisGamingDragon so Witchers?
[5:39:11] <+m3chamike> I understand you so much Plague
[5:39:14] <conservativerk> XD
[5:39:20] <ThisGamingDragon> @paralurx that sounds like it could happen
[5:39:20] <ahegotrigger> Plague needs quotes because this is so fucking good
[5:39:24] <Lenmutt> Fantastic Racism great trope
[5:39:37] <beetbo2> you cut off their horns
[5:39:40] <ThisGamingDragon> @antchodeny yeah...
[5:39:42] <beetbo2> so they can feel that shame
[5:39:42] <ahegotrigger> God I wish I were a goat racist
[5:39:59] <mortelkilll> we gotta appreciate the dumb dickiheaddness of our fellow animals
[5:40:05] <mortelkilll> but videogame goats can fuck off
[5:40:10] <Lenmutt> Eli would be the best jedi master
[5:40:12] <beetbo2> you ever see that video of a goat getting killed by an eage?
[5:40:14] <beetbo2> eagle?
[5:40:15] <+m3chamike> Can I be ageist towards teenagers?
[5:40:17] <LordFalara> until modern star wars gets good, old eu is canon, and disney wars is fanfiction, because its written like bad fanfiction, so thats whst you get to be fucko
[5:40:23] <Paralurx> Being a terrible spiteful shitbag can be pretty satisfying in games
[5:40:24] <conservativerk> Videogames are not real life, kids.
[5:40:27] <conservativerk> XD
[5:40:30] <sircool099> Plague "Killy the Billys" of gripes
[5:40:30] <beetbo2> diagonal
[5:40:31] <Triblade1992> @LordFalara That's not how that works dude
[5:40:33] <ahegotrigger> cut off one horn too
[5:40:34] <beetbo2> diagonals
[5:40:34] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Plague wants the Sin City option on the goats
[5:40:42] <LordPubious> goat wheelie
[5:40:45] <beetbo2> so it'll never have balance
[5:40:48] <%MarkSoupial> return of the jedi is my favoprite fanfiction
[5:40:49] <+nesence2> thats why i play D&D, you get ot be an awful person in the presence of friends, and everyone will laugh.
[5:40:56] <Triblade1992> alternating ones via Edward Elric
[5:40:57] <Paralurx> Alternating ones for sure
[5:40:58] <Samex_Comex> Wait a minute why dose your droid not have a flashlight?
[5:40:59] <+TheSaintJohn> monkaS
[5:41:05] <Lenmutt> Chop horns so it can't get laid
[5:41:06] <LordPubious> alternating it would walk like a caterpillar
[5:41:09] <guyman125> alternating for sure
[5:41:16] <beetbo2> make it a parapalegic
[5:41:25] <sircool099> it does have a flashlight, it's just poorly powered
[5:41:28] <beetbo2> you're the AM of goats @PlagueOfGripes
[5:41:32] <LordFalara> littledroid does have a flashlight
[5:41:34] <%caramello_man> just make it a head in a jar
[5:41:35] <otakon17> what is this monkaS thing?
[5:41:36] <ThisGamingDragon> I'm scared
[5:41:42] <otakon17> what did I miss?
[5:41:43] <beetbo2> soon
[5:41:48] <otakon17> NOPE
[5:41:53] <%MarkSoupial> oh hey one of these balls
[5:41:53] <beetbo2> iirc, soon
[5:41:54] <otakon17> SOON:tm: though
[5:41:57] <Triblade1992> I think you have to stand on it
[5:42:00] <mortelkilll> some people just need to satiate their sadistic or raging toughts somewhere
[5:42:03] <otakon17> elevator time
[5:42:06] <otakon17> HOO BOY
[5:42:07] <morcego_cinzento_arts> Is it good or bad that i'm relating to plague more then ever with the dark fantasies involving torture?
[5:42:11] <otakon17> FAVORITE ENEMY TYPE INCOMING
[5:42:16] <mortelkilll> probably more peopel than we want ot admit need some place to get really pissed
[5:42:20] <+m3chamike> I have to work as a shift supervisor for a company, so most of my day I’m dealing with idiots and my coworkers all day and smile and shit and sometimes, I just want to literrally take off someone’s finger with a spoon.
[5:42:22] <LordFalara> im buying this tommorow after work
[5:42:27] <conservativerk> I was going to buy this game but I'm not putting doen £55 until I am certain a fully fleshed-out, polished game is released.
[5:42:27] <otakon17> So Plague did you figure outthe kick yet?
[5:42:31] <LordFalara> its exactly what ive wanted for years
[5:42:33] <conservativerk> *down
[5:42:39] <ThisGamingDragon> it's like a ps2 game mixed with Death Stranding
[5:42:40] <Paralurx> Oh cool the Darth Maul thing. Can you make your character do that flippy-doo?
[5:42:41] <Samex_Comex> Try headbutting it
[5:42:44] <otakon17> @conservativerk from everything I have seen from streams and reviews it's just that
[5:42:58] <sircool099> incoming foe that is sponge until you get the tool at the end of the zelda dungeon
[5:42:59] <otakon17> it's GLOWING RED ofc it's gonna come up
[5:43:04] <beetbo2> @Samex_Comex deny the goat within
[5:43:05] <Triblade1992> the fuq
[5:43:08] <SuperVaderMan> Commence the jigglin
[5:43:10] <Lenmutt> Whoa plague has double saber already?
[5:43:11] <otakon17> um
[5:43:14] <otakon17> it's not freaking out
[5:43:14] <%Rezca> shh, its quivering
[5:43:18] <%MarkSoupial> HE SHAKES WITH FEAR
[5:43:18] <beetbo2> ummm that's not the engine
[5:43:18] <otakon17> it's SUPPOSED to do that
[5:43:22] <ziggyjesus> They'll probably release a complete edition with all the dlc, I'll buy it when that version goes on sale
[5:43:30] <otakon17> they explode
[5:43:30] <beetbo2> it's a seizure spikey boi
[5:43:35] <+m3chamike> They’re freaking out in anticipation
[5:43:36] <otakon17> they're also scannable
[5:43:37] <sircool099> land-mine plants
[5:43:40] <conservativerk> I'm done with buying games in 2010s unless they're released the way they were prior to this era -__- I'm not messing around anymore. I mean corporate greed has become terrible.
[5:43:44] <LordFalara> i genuinely hope this game gets an expansion cuz more good game is always good
[5:43:47] <conservativerk> @otakon17 Oh, really?
[5:43:51] <beetbo2> SKUNGUS
[5:43:52] <jiin6> Skungus
[5:43:53] <Lenmutt> Pat got blown up by it
[5:43:54] <otakon17> our boys the Skungus!
[5:43:56] <beetbo2> big skungus
[5:44:00] <otakon17> the xplodey boys
[5:44:02] <Paralurx> it's QUIVERING with anticipation Plague
[5:44:05] <otakon17> they just explode if you agitate them
[5:44:10] <Kurudan> it's loins are quivering
[5:44:11] <LordFalara> yeah their called skungus, sounds like something nic would come up with
[5:44:16] <sircool099> no, they're basically moving exploding barrels
[5:44:19] <morcego_cinzento_arts> It's quivering with sexual anticipation
[5:44:19] <otakon17> they quiver with anti
[5:44:22] <beetbo2> they'll explode with their spores and juices
[5:44:23] <AntChodeny> why is that plant oscillating?
[5:44:26] <otakon17> cipation!
[5:44:30] <beetbo2> cuz you got em hot and bothered
[5:44:41] <otakon17> Ratty boys!
[5:44:53] <otakon17> yous off the beaten path is why
[5:45:00] <sircool099> double-blade is crowd control/aoe. Single blad is focused on one target
[5:45:01] <beetbo2> right on his face too
[5:45:01] <Paralurx> The true Royal Rat Authority
[5:45:03] <beetbo2> ouchie
[5:45:08] <Lenmutt> Plague of Gripes vs Nature
[5:45:17] <otakon17> Nature does NOT like Plague
[5:45:41] <otakon17> actually this is an easy puzzle
[5:45:45] <sircool099> welcome to the wind dungeon
[5:45:51] <Lenmutt> Did Plague like the Frogs?
[5:45:55] <jiin6> Nature hates everything
[5:45:56] <ScarletCyclone> Plague vs Nature
[5:46:01] <sircool099> your zelda tool is waiting at the end of the dungeon
[5:46:06] <otakon17> you need to open on emore vent
[5:46:23] <Samex_Comex> Lightsaber hookshot
[5:46:33] <otakon17> Where is the saber throw dammit?
[5:46:40] <beetbo2> Psychometry
[5:46:44] <otakon17> Psychometry
[5:46:53] <+m3chamike> You could try pushing it with your functioning body
[5:46:56] <ThisGamingDragon> Like, I hate how platformer video game this game is... But at the same time it's got all these AAA features. Like they pity us.
[5:46:57] <%MarkSoupial> puzzle space
[5:46:57] <Lenmutt> Slow time?
[5:47:07] <otakon17> hey THAT BAR GOT BUSTED
[5:47:24] <ThisGamingDragon> It's an abomination
[5:47:27] <beetbo2> think it's a tutorial thing
[5:47:30] <beetbo2> oh
[5:47:31] <SuperVaderMan> Puzzle hard, solve it for me game
[5:47:32] <beetbo2> nvm
[5:47:33] <otakon17> lol
[5:47:38] <otakon17> Star Souls Dogs but Rats
[5:47:43] <Lenmutt> 100%
[5:47:54] <beetbo2> You can feel that this game had a younger audience in mind
[5:47:56] <Paralurx> Dark Wars rat-dogs
[5:47:57] <sircool099> it's not progress
[5:48:00] <otakon17> Plague the bars you investigated JUST a second ago got busted by the ball
[5:48:05] <LordFalara> see i have no issue with this being hack and slash uncharted in star wars
[5:48:09] <LordFalara> because its good
[5:48:17] <%MarkSoupial> i'm excited for this puzzle to give you the power to obsolete this puzzle
[5:48:20] <Triblade1992> I think both have to be on
[5:48:20] <sircool099> you can't solve this room until you get new power
[5:48:26] <Frog_of_Justic> Dont worry Pat spent ages being killed by Rats and Goats
[5:48:27] <+m3chamike> Yeah problem with this game is that it’s ripping off Dark Souls but it doesn’t do anything interesting with it.
[5:48:34] <LordFalara> i like hack and slashes, i like uncharted, i like star wars
[5:48:37] <morcego_cinzento_arts> i need to get some sleep. so bye bye everybody
[5:48:43] <otakon17> the ball busted the wall
[5:48:45] <%Rezca> when the ball smacked in to that wall
[5:48:49] <LordFalara> its not ripping off dark souls outside the baffling enemy respawn
[5:49:02] <LordFalara> the combat is just a action hack and slash videogame
[5:49:13] <ThisGamingDragon> @lordfalara lol like I hate that it looks like such a video game, but it's hyper realistic and everything too. like it seems like something Unholy.
[5:49:15] <LordFalara> dark souls didnt invent dodging attacks, blocking, and countering
[5:49:19] <Neoripo> Get that China dick
[5:49:20] <otakon17> you gotta turn off the vent
[5:49:26] <otakon17> I think
[5:49:35] <LordFalara> dark souls just made videogame have punishment again
[5:49:58] <Lenmutt> Cmon you can do it lil ball
[5:50:00] <sircool099> pretty sure you can't solve this room until you get power at the end
[5:50:05] <ScarletCyclone> So, is this just Star Wars Zelda Souls?
[5:50:15] <otakon17> I think the one in the upper left corner
[5:50:22] <Paralurx> Dark Souls invented dogs when it released back in 1998 alongside Ocarina of Time
[5:50:23] <LordFalara> congrats youve made the ball go in circles
[5:50:31] <+m3chamike> @lordfalara you’re right, but the dodge movement, stamina meter, and attack speed all act the same as Dark Souls.
[5:50:55] <LordFalara> dark souls invented attacking and dodging enemys back in 1980 when it released in arcades as pacman
[5:51:07] <otakon17> welp I guess you can't solve this puzzle yet
[5:51:16] <ThisGamingDragon> Like fast action and slow realistic animations don't mix
[5:51:29] <sircool099> you need the power at the end of the zelda dungeon to solve this
[5:51:39] <ThisGamingDragon> except for DMC5
[5:51:44] <+QuasartheHero> hm wasn't expecting puzzels like this in an action game
[5:51:52] <otakon17> as a Jedi
[5:51:56] <sircool099> you get push at the end of the dungeon
[5:51:59] <+m3chamike> Nah you can totally do it. It’s simpler than you think
[5:52:04] <LordFalara> to me this games combat plays like force unleashed was originally mesnt to play as before they started toying with physics
[5:52:16] <dowmein> is this the sonic 06 ball puzzle?
[5:52:17] <%Rezca> turn off the others?
[5:52:28] <%MarkSoupial> the sonic 06 ball puzzle is easy
[5:52:28] <otakon17> HEY it worked
[5:52:28] <ziggyjesus> It's like a slower force awakens
[5:52:32] <LordFalara> hot damn good job
[5:52:33] <otakon17> that's surprising
[5:52:35] <+m3chamike> Do it you shit
[5:52:35] <sircool099> congrats you got the bonus
[5:52:37] <otakon17> good job Plague
[5:52:41] <sircool099> THIS WASNT EVEN PROGRESS LOL
[5:52:43] <Lenmutt> Maybe the ball will smack cal and he'll remember force push
[5:52:46] <+QuasartheHero> @lordfalara so, does it have good ai and good feeling combats
[5:52:55] <otakon17> that's ti
[5:52:57] <otakon17> that's the prize
[5:53:01] <otakon17> it's a portion of an upgrade
[5:53:06] <Lenmutt> Secrets
[5:53:06] <LordFalara> i played for like 2 and ahalf hours and on hard mode
[5:53:08] <otakon17> like how God of War did
[5:53:10] <LordFalara> combat feels fine
[5:53:10] <otakon17> and Zelda does
[5:53:16] <+QuasartheHero> good
[5:53:16] <+m3chamike> Makes you have the good feels
[5:53:22] <ScarletCyclone> Lore and a piece of heart.
[5:53:22] <LordFalara> AI was aggressive on hard mode
[5:53:23] <otakon17> collect three for a Force Bar upgrade
[5:53:23] <+m3chamike> Dance gamer dance
[5:53:25] <beetbo2> soon
[5:53:37] <LordFalara> game feels like witcher 3 with a good combat system
[5:53:41] <beetbo2> it does equal use
[5:53:46] <otakon17> LIGHTSABER! Oh god I only meant to turn on the lights!
[5:53:56] <ziggyjesus> This really is nothing like witcher 3
[5:53:59] <Triblade1992> I think you are suppose to turn it off
[5:54:01] <beetbo2> lightsaber fork
[5:54:03] <otakon17> What happens when you let go of a pendulum
[5:54:07] <ThisGamingDragon> What's that game coming out that's like No man's sky but good?
[5:54:09] <LordFalara> i meant in how aggressive enemy groups are on hard mode
[5:54:14] <Lenmutt> Why'd Eli go Orange?
[5:54:17] <+m3chamike> Turn it off and on again/
[5:54:20] <otakon17> he likes orange
[5:54:21] <beetbo2> ok that was pretty wonky
[5:54:25] <otakon17> HOW do you keep missing these jumps?!
[5:54:30] <Lenmutt> Thanks
[5:54:32] <jiin6> Orange for the ginger nut
[5:54:45] <%Rezca> press button to use
[5:54:52] <+QuasartheHero> bitterShrug
[5:55:29] <sircool099> you get more slots at the end of the dungeon
[5:55:30] <Lenmutt> Give those poor troopers a break
[5:55:32] <dowmein> when do you think dexter jetster is going to get his yoda fight scene with dooku?
[5:55:40] <+m3chamike> “Lightsaber equals use” To be fair, you’re thinking like Anakin.
[5:55:41] <Huntercd> Alexa, use lightsaber
[5:56:04] <LordFalara> in the clone wars a dexter jetster type species dual weilds double bladed lightsabers and fights an army of clones solo
[5:56:07] <+QuasartheHero> @dowmein you mean jedi outcast 2 with the realistic lightsaber mod
[5:56:08] <otakon17> all the balls
[5:56:10] <Lenmutt> Chozo but pissy
[5:56:12] <otakon17> speaking of BALLS
[5:56:30] <sircool099> suggestion: Don't fight it until you get the power. it's a massive damage spong
[5:56:32] <beetbo2> lol
[5:56:37] <otakon17> "I can SEE you Plague"
[5:56:43] <otakon17> XD

[5:58:37] <+QuasartheHero> sounds like a pain
[5:58:45] <Lenmutt> Pat struggled with that so much, nice Eli
[5:59:02] <$Sealion_Live> If you haven't gotten to chapter 3 then you are DEFINITELY in the backyard
[5:59:15] <Paralurx> The big brain am winning again!
[5:59:23] <Huntercd> I wish I could watch Death Stranding That fetus makes me uncomfortable
[5:59:50] <$Sealion_Live> and the Backyard is a bloody good term for the starting area of Death Stranding. I have problems with that starting area
[6:00:02] <sircool099> doesn't the scanner fade after a while?
[6:00:30] <beetbo2> weee
[6:00:50] <Paralurx> Press the "fun" button to initiate "fun"
[6:00:53] <+RaikenTB> Will rope physics ever look good? LUL
[6:00:57] <%MarkSoupial> wow THREE movement mechanics in a row
[6:01:00] <%MarkSoupial> GAMEPLAY
[6:01:03] <+RaikenTB> This reminds me of Opposing Force.
[6:01:06] <$Sealion_Live> One day Raiken, one day
[6:01:16] <ziggyjesus> Uncharted 4 had good rope physics with the grappling hook
[6:01:35] <%MarkSoupial> now THIS is sonic 06
[6:01:50] <LordFalara> its not at all like sonic 06
[6:01:58] <+Diabeticcat> Guided taint controls?
[6:02:12] <LordFalara> you jumped like a week early
[6:02:13] <%MarkSoupial> jumping off a slide onto a specific point and missing? that's VERY sonic 06
[6:02:14] <beetbo2> omg
[6:02:20] <+RaikenTB> Tank controls are fine as long as jumping isn't involved.
[6:02:20] <otakon17> Plauge I think your controller is busted
[6:02:36] <%MarkSoupial> and I play sonic 06 for FUN
[6:02:41] <beetbo2> ^
[6:02:44] <beetbo2> a real legend
[6:02:50] <sircool099> you're insane if you do that
[6:02:52] <otakon17> cabbage
[6:02:58] <%MarkSoupial> an acceptable title
[6:03:00] <otakon17> woof barely made it
[6:03:03] <Lenmutt> Use the Force Plague!
[6:03:06] <+RaikenTB> So basically kimchi.
[6:03:10] <ThisGamingDragon> So I don't know if anyone has asked you yet, Plague. But whaddya think about the new sonic movie model?
[6:03:24] <LordFalara> my platforming has been honed in the fires of warrior within psp
[6:03:27] <ThisGamingDragon> @marksoupial same here
[6:03:30] <beetbo2> hump that rope
[6:03:36] <Lenmutt> Oh that looks great
[6:03:39] <Triblade1992> I think it's rope physics to make the player to focus on where they are going
[6:03:42] <LordFalara> my platforming has been folded wan trirrion times
[6:04:05] <beetbo2> lol
[6:04:15] <beetbo2> outlander?

[6:06:06] <+RaikenTB> "You will do this rope sequence again" LUL
[6:06:10] <beetbo2> wish and it shall be
[6:06:28] <Paralurx> CAN'T MISS
[6:06:35] <LordFalara> id love it if the game legitimately said you will do this segment again as punishment
[6:06:35] <beetbo2> how
[6:06:35] <otakon17> inb4 he misses
[6:06:38] <Kurudan> new word acquired
[6:06:39] <otakon17> DOWN THE ROAD
[6:06:41] <beetbo2> he loses speed so fast
[6:06:47] <otakon17> and somehow he missed
[6:06:52] <ziggyjesus> Plague will be stuck on this rock forever
[6:06:58] <+subliiime4668> Jump on the platform
[6:07:01] <beetbo2> too low?
[6:07:02] <ziggyjesus> Playthrough over
[6:07:02] <otakon17> you carry momentum like carrying a tune in a bucket
[6:07:03] <+subliiime4668> Not the next rope
[6:07:04] <+RaikenTB> Did you know the rope was one of the first tools?
[6:07:10] <beetbo2> you see that?
[6:07:19] <beetbo2> it's like Cal just gives up
[6:07:23] <%MarkSoupial> can you darksign?
[6:07:40] <Lenmutt> The poncho was asick trap
[6:07:46] <beetbo2> is there a way to shimmy up the rope?
[6:07:56] <otakon17> the poncho was a trap
[6:08:06] <Triblade1992> WOW

[6:08:48] <Nexzalas> Ah, yes, patented EA Terrible Game Design(tm)
[6:08:49] <Lenmutt> Many younglings died trying to get that poncho
[6:08:50] <ThisGamingDragon> Plague's abusive relationship with the rope
[6:08:55] <otakon17> like can you go a little further down the rope?
[6:09:02] <AntChodeny> i ship it
[6:09:03] <Huntercd> I like the ginger man wants to die

[6:17:50] <ScarletCyclone> If they didn't, they sure did after.
[6:17:53] <gl0vesup7> Anything else > twitch connection
[6:18:08] <%MarkSoupial> time for psi ops
[6:18:26] <ScarletCyclone> Monolith fights back
[6:18:39] <Lenmutt> Suddenly remembers despite other breakable walls earlier
[6:18:47] <Huntercd> So they didn't have maternal or paternal rage against Anakin?
[6:18:49] <gl0vesup7> I hate the fucking memories so much
[6:18:53] <ThisGamingDragon> This game subverted your expectations Kappa
[6:19:00] <+RaikenTB> LUL

[6:19:50] <Lenmutt> Sith\jedi basketball would be fun
[6:19:51] <SuperVaderMan> bark PogChamp
[6:19:52] <gl0vesup7> So just before the memory he just had amnesia about the force push or??

[6:20:42] <Huntercd> That one dude
[6:20:45] <Samex_Comex> loreing sounds icky
[6:20:57] <dowmein> is this that monster from thor?
[6:21:01] <ScarletCyclone> He had ptsd about his training that he obviously repressed from the looks of it.
[6:21:02] <LordFalara> he lost connection to the force due to the trauma of order 66 as a child, so he has to relearn them
[6:21:05] <%MarkSoupial> kicking its own ass

[6:22:25] <Mrhuggles> Bossk is the name of a reptile person, not species.
[6:22:28] <%MarkSoupial> lore?
[6:22:38] <SuperVaderMan> Found a cool tree, now we wanna go to Kashyyyk I guess
[6:22:40] <%MarkSoupial> is this post-war kashyyk?
[6:23:03] <ThisGamingDragon> what about the Droid attack on the wookies?
[6:23:05] <Lenmutt> You have push for all those other doors
[6:23:06] <seth45er> Kwa they where kwa
[6:23:19] <Huntercd> Lady Wookies yes
[6:23:36] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical useful upgrades
[6:23:39] <Mrhuggles> Kwa-Saki Ninja bitterSmug
[6:23:44] <ThisGamingDragon> I said the meme guys
[6:24:03] <+silvery_cricket> Man the protagonist of this game looks like such a goober
[6:24:16] <%MarkSoupial> pretty sure ginger lego face is already familiar with repulse Kappa
[6:24:26] <Lenmutt> Ginger not goober
[6:24:30] <Mrhuggles> that was a shity dash strike. more like a dash, then strike.
[6:24:34] <gl0vesup7> Weak ginger child
[6:24:37] <Mrhuggles> XD
[6:24:40] <SuperVaderMan> Star wars kid LUL
[6:24:46] <LordFalara> i like him, he looks like a normal ass teen
[6:24:48] <+silvery_cricket> Ah yes the try not to get shot maneuver
[6:24:51] <gl0vesup7> LUL
[6:24:54] <a_mad_dragon> he's trying to dab
[6:25:02] <ziggyjesus> The naruto run of the Star Wars universe
[6:25:03] <+KawaiiJetty> He is doing his best
[6:25:08] <ThisGamingDragon> is this a game where you between good and evil?
[6:25:21] <SuperVaderMan> Slightly inconvenience your foes LUL
[6:25:26] <Huntercd> They had all that money but couldn't afford to get him better clothes
[6:25:33] <Lenmutt> Laser blast hitting a ginger would be bad
[6:25:55] <ThisGamingDragon> I like that he covers his face. That's so what should happen
[6:26:04] <gl0vesup7> As we all know, the skin of gingers is made out of wet paper
[6:26:19] <LordFalara> i assume if kal survives this game there will be a sequel where hes more cool in combat
[6:26:25] <dowmein> finally
[6:26:29] <dowmein> box pushing gameplay
[6:26:30] <LordFalara> i like that hes a skilled dork
[6:26:39] <LordFalara> it sells that hes inexperienced
[6:27:20] <Lenmutt> Cal falls to the Empire and the Second Sister gives him to the Ninth Sister as a sex slave.
[6:27:37] <beetbo2> lewd
[6:27:43] <ThisGamingDragon> Also maybe adds a little reality and danger
[6:27:45] <Huntercd> That real?
[6:27:48] <beetbo2> perfect for a fan faction
[6:27:55] <gl0vesup7> That’s a fan fiction for sure
[6:28:03] <+silvery_cricket> Is this one of those games that depicts the force as farts from your hand
[6:28:36] <gl0vesup7> Kinda
[6:28:50] <a_mad_dragon> he stomp
[6:28:50] <gl0vesup7> Not as much as force unleashed
[6:29:19] <ThisGamingDragon> I also like that he just waves the Saber in front of him instead of some dumb fan spin anime shit
[6:29:29] <SuperVaderMan> can you push the big balls now?
[6:29:48] <ThisGamingDragon> while running I mean
[6:30:00] <%Rezca> slam balls ?
[6:30:01] <Frog_of_Justic> Bowling time
[6:30:07] <+RaikenTB> shatter them with your massive balls.
[6:30:15] <%Rezca> do it
[6:31:20] <+RaikenTB> yes.
[6:31:27] <+lostforte> this is pretty good
[6:31:28] <Triblade1992> I like watching this video game
[6:31:35] <SuperVaderMan> I enjoy the adventures of idiot poncho ginger
[6:31:35] <ziggyjesus> I wanna see you keep playing this
[6:31:37] <dowmein> you could just play dark messiah because it's this but good
[6:31:39] <ThisGamingDragon> Play pokemanz Ireland
[6:31:43] <gl0vesup7> I like plague shitting on everything
[6:31:44] <ScarletCyclone> I'm fine with you playing whatever.
[6:31:53] <gl0vesup7> Inject the hate into my veins

[6:32:39] <Triblade1992> try force pushing the wa
[6:32:41] <Huntercd> We pinball
[6:32:42] <Triblade1992> *wall
[6:33:43] <ScarletCyclone> Amazing that they stole the puzzles from Darksiders 2, eh?
[6:34:12] <Triblade1992> air chimes
[6:34:34] <gl0vesup7> I mean ball puzzles is like standard vidya game shit
[6:34:56] <boatzndhoez> what does plague think of product so far
[6:35:02] <%MarkSoupial> LUL couldnt scan until that door was up
[6:35:06] <%Rezca> ball>box puzzles
[6:35:12] <ScarletCyclone> "Dead People are weird."
[6:35:33] <ScarletCyclone> I'll take ball puzzles over Block Puzzles any day, tbh.
[6:35:50] <%MarkSoupial> remember that game The Ball?
[6:35:57] <SuperVaderMan> do you need a third ball?
[6:36:10] <ScarletCyclone> Ballz 3D
[6:36:32] <SuperVaderMan> are you able to get the ball from the other room over?
[6:36:37] <%MarkSoupial> you got a portal gun except it pushed and pulled a giant ball
[6:36:51] <%Rezca> did you try force pushing that pendulum?
[6:38:03] <gl0vesup7> Big brain hours
[6:39:08] <Kurudan> plague all
[6:39:25] <Kurudan> plague all-thoughts
[6:40:03] <King_thunder365> This area is reminding of me a part from Legend Of Dragoon where you go to that society where you have to revise some of their laws just to progress.
[6:40:17] <+sourceofall> so I'm confused, is this scifi god of war?
[6:40:27] <dowmein> @ScarletCyclone Sonic 06 Ball room
[6:40:38] <+sourceofall> cause it certainly doesn't feel like star wars
[6:40:46] <gl0vesup7> Lmao
[6:40:49] <ScarletCyclone> Balls all around
[6:40:51] <dowmein> also this whole game seems like "Video Game: The Game"
[6:41:00] <+RaikenTB> The Surge and Dark Souls did the fusion dance.
[6:41:04] <Triblade1992> The pendulum
[6:41:08] <LordPubious> is this an old jedi training ground or is this the worlds most elaborate lock?
[6:41:10] <gl0vesup7> The ball room is in a league of its own
[6:41:13] <Triblade1992> which has a ball in the middle
[6:41:16] <%Rezca> force push pendulum?
[6:41:29] <dowmein> just start hitting things until something happens
[6:41:36] <%Rezca> different angle
[6:41:40] <Triblade1992> I think you need to move it so that it breaks the wall
[6:41:48] <a_mad_dragon> BECOME the ball
[6:41:51] <%caramello_man> push the swing into the door?
[6:41:54] <%Rezca> smash it
[6:41:58] <+RaikenTB> Could you smash the wall?
[6:42:13] <gl0vesup7> Can you stand on it and cut the rope?
[6:42:43] <Frog_of_Justic> smash the wall with the pendulum?
[6:42:45] <Triblade1992> I think you need to stand behind it and force push it into the wall
[6:42:57] <%caramello_man> yeah
[6:43:03] <dowmein> smooth brain
[6:43:03] <+RaikenTB> That looked terrible LUL
[6:43:10] <gl0vesup7> WOWEE
[6:43:16] <gl0vesup7> IT JUST PLOPPED OUT
[6:43:17] <ScarletCyclone> Those violent jedi with their solutions.
[6:43:29] <gl0vesup7> LIKE A TURD
[6:43:30] <Lenmutt> That looked very flaccid
[6:43:34] <%caramello_man> "puzzles"
[6:43:38] <dowmein> You thought they actually spent time to make a clever puzzle?
[6:43:41] <%Rezca> VideoGames
[6:43:46] <+Sebenoth> also that wall was only smashable from one side? ..sure
[6:43:56] <+RaikenTB> look at this Rube Goldberg shit.
[6:44:23] <%MarkSoupial> mphRadical unlimited energy generator
[6:44:36] <King_thunder365> Much like The Jewbacca Defense: “IT DOESN’T. MAKE. SENSE.”
[6:44:56] <Lenmutt> Remember in BOTW that one Sheikah shrine were the puzzle is to lure away an alcoholic Gerudo?
[6:45:20] <%Rezca> nah, the force has a way to remake walls
[6:45:35] <+Double_Tap_That> Can't make hard puzzles for a mass-marketed game with a well-known IP
[6:45:43] <%MarkSoupial> the jedi died for this
[6:46:02] <Triblade1992> so now you can force push the ball
[6:46:17] <+sourceofall> they foresaw this future and decided to build this whole thing to fuck with you
[6:46:18] <%MarkSoupial> so that whole puzzle was so you could explit a broken part of the elvator that brought you there in the first place
[6:46:18] <Lenmutt> Jedi were pretty foolish
[6:46:26] <Triblade1992> I think you have to go back up
[6:46:36] <dowmein> anakin?
[6:46:36] <ThisGamingDragon> @Double_Tap_That Absolutely right
[6:47:07] <%MarkSoupial> mphDerp
[6:48:06] <HiddenPorpoise> Kazshyyyyyyyyk
[6:48:50] <King_thunder365> Time to begin our path to going to 9 planets!
[6:49:25] <+RaikenTB> LUL
[6:49:34] <Triblade1992> :lul:
[6:49:37] <Lenmutt> That's hilarious! Lordy the jedi suck!!!!
[6:49:45] <Triblade1992> LUL
[6:50:13] <dowmein> Star Wars
[6:50:16] <gl0vesup7> Of course that would work
[6:50:20] <MonstarGrrrl> the boy who cried sith
[6:50:32] <ThisGamingDragon> Make the truth seem like the rumors
[6:50:52] <ThereIsNoJustice> plague bought next product? woo
[6:53:04] <ThisGamingDragon> Jeez plague LULZ
[6:54:01] <gl0vesup7> Woah there buster
[6:54:09] <%MarkSoupial> mphDerp
[6:54:14] <ziggyjesus> No way, I refuse to believe this is real
[6:54:31] <%MarkSoupial> sith history by rian johnson
[6:54:32] <Kurudan> SeemsGood job well done
[6:54:33] <shevan123> that sounds like complete shit
[6:54:41] <LordPubious> the jedi probably did lots of twirls with their lightsabers
[6:54:49] <Triblade1992> the problem is the logic is "Oh he killed 5 people but was gravely injured" and it's clearly poorly executed
[6:55:03] <dowmein> well he's a sith, duh
[6:55:26] <dowmein> also those stormtroopers are probably really bored
[6:55:31] <gl0vesup7> Because an order of like 500 million + force masters can’t foresee basic toddler tricks
[6:55:42] <King_thunder365> “We’ve managed to avoid drowning!”
[6:56:12] <gl0vesup7> I’m surprised Jedi masters even remember to breath
[6:56:16] <ahegotrigger> LUL
[6:56:22] <ThereIsNoJustice> you guys can't see the damage numbers but this rant is an AOE attack on the stormtroopers
[6:56:23] <ahegotrigger> thats so fucking stupid
[6:56:26] <%caramello_man> That's not dumb jedi, that's just bad writing
[6:56:28] <Lenmutt> May the
[6:56:48] <Lenmutt> Force serve you well
[6:57:02] <senfood> The Jedi's level of complacency around this time was fucking mind boggling.
[6:57:05] <gl0vesup7> True @caramello_man
[6:57:10] <shevan123> that sounds so bad even for starwars
[6:57:20] <Maids4lyfe> Jedi are fucking stupid
[6:57:38] <dowmein> well, destiny
[6:57:42] <senfood> You know they just wanted to get back to Coruscant.
[6:57:47] <%caramello_man> People who write star wars are fucking stupid
[6:57:51] <gl0vesup7> But that’s the thing though, Jedi are written to be stupid AT EVERYTHING
[6:58:05] <LordPubious> Buddhists in space
[6:58:05] <gl0vesup7> Movies games novels
[6:58:06] <Triblade1992> Gee, if only there was episodes of Clone Wars and a certain Sequel trilogy movie that LITERALLY SAID THE SAME THING
[6:58:10] <a_mad_dragon> that's the jedi, one hand on their lightsabre and the other hand on their dick
[6:58:18] <Kurudan> yep. ahsoka situation was similar
[6:58:34] <gl0vesup7> In every medium, they are written to be stupid
[6:58:36] <Lenmutt> Just basic follow up
[6:58:39] <+sourceofall> they got used to the force telling them what to do, even though that 100% of the time eventually goes terribly wrong
[6:58:42] <$SilverRoddo> bitterDab he just idle animation dabbed.
[6:58:50] <seth45er> they never use the systems of goverment to there advantage
[6:58:51] <senfood> It went on for literal millennia. The Jedi are unintelligent assholes and the Sith are violent psychopaths.
[6:58:56] <Maids4lyfe> it's their fault the sith always keep coming back, they don't do anything to help their members who start to go to the dark side, they shun and kill them without trying to figure out why some of them have trouble with emotions
[6:58:56] <Triblade1992> Luke literally said "The Jedi were failures because at the height of their own power, they let Sidious take control"
[6:59:06] <shevan123> thank you for the rant
[6:59:29] <gl0vesup7> This is why the grey side dudes are always the best
[6:59:42] <Triblade1992> That was my favorite part in TLJ where Luke was just shitting on tthe Jedi since he is the only TRUE good Jedi
[6:59:50] <Triblade1992> The others sucked SO MUCH
[7:00:23] <shevan123> the books with luke are supposed to be pretty good right?
[7:00:32] <ahegotrigger> isnt Luke also a grey Force user
[7:00:32] <Triblade1992> lol
[7:00:36] <Maids4lyfe> lol
[7:00:37] <ahegotrigger> good job Plague
[7:00:38] <ThisGamingDragon> That is Rian trying to be a good writer @Triblade1992
[7:00:41] <Maids4lyfe> good night plague
[7:00:42] <senfood> Nice rants!
[7:00:48] <Triblade1992> Basically @ahegotrigger and also Ahsoka became one too
[7:00:50] <shevan123> gg mate
[7:00:56] <ThisGamingDragon> good night
[7:00:57] <Lenmutt> Glad i manage to catch this
[7:01:07] <ziggyjesus> Good stream
[7:01:12] <ahegotrigger> so all the non pyschopath non morons are writen into gray huh
[7:01:16] <ThisGamingDragon> I can try to do that
[7:01:16] <%MarkSoupial> mmMMMMmmm
[7:01:16] <Triblade1992> @ThisGamingDragon He isn't wrong though. he was on the same boat as Filloni
[7:01:17] <ahegotrigger> written
[7:01:26] <gl0vesup7> Crush my cock with a rock I must
[7:01:42] <Sir__Nova> Night Plague
[7:01:42] <Triblade1992> Both Filloni and Rian REALLY hated the Jedi order of old
[7:01:52] <ThisGamingDragon> What day?
[7:02:02] <~PlagueOfGripes> "then"
