[0:31:49] <%CapnClassix> hunting horn songs always helpful, dafuq
[0:31:50] <+Mrbaconator> hunting horn LITERALLY BUFFS PEOPLE
[0:31:54] <%Agami23> i switched to hunting horn recently and i dont think i can go back
[0:31:54] <BliVru> Chat help me decide. Elden Ring or Total Warhammer 3?
[0:31:54] <Profmcstevie> HH is good for everyone >:( Longswords can get bullied
[0:31:56] <TREEMAN9999> just use flinch free dorks
[0:31:56] <%CapnClassix> ATTACK UP BITCHES
[0:31:58] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Wait who said HH is bad ?
[0:32:00] <Zeif00> that is the opposite, hh is good for team
[0:32:01] <owensleftfoot> blame capcom for adding the stupid multiplayer flinching
[0:32:01] <Blank9> nothing is bad for teammates if you just slap flinch free onto your gear
[0:32:01] <+GeneralGray8> Hunting Horn mains are the real heroes
[0:32:02] <marrowjuice> IT LITERALLY BUFFS YOU????
[0:32:03] <skyshinecrusader> how is hunting horn bad in any way?
[0:32:05] <%YakumoYomi> Probably thinking of the Superpound, which knocks people away
[0:32:06] <%SmiteKnight> Your welcome as always, Peregg.
[0:32:09] <CptHarlok> Probably someone who doesn't use trip resistance for some reason.
[0:32:10] <%IamGrapes> @BliVru both
[0:32:11] <%notsoy> elden ring now, WH3 for the next two years
[0:32:11] <%skrewarrior> if they dont want to get staggered they can build flinch free or move
[0:32:16] <%Infinity0D> HH is the defacto support weapon, aside from doing pretty good damage
[0:32:16] <vandastelka> @BliVru elden ring
[0:32:17] <IvanMistwalker> GOD OF WAR ZANGIEF
[0:32:18] <GarbageNirvana> Dude's probably just salty about HH
[0:32:18] <%Order_of_Mystery> he's too strong
[0:32:18] <rytisone> now this is content
[0:32:20] <Just_GR> The fuck is happening LUL

[0:38:22] <%unfathomarble> Wholden ring
[0:38:23] <thunderborn32> @TheBitingIrish hackie boys can use the DS netcode to get your bank info
[0:38:24] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HE'S LITERALLY DOING THAT NOW
[0:38:25] <BluBox> What is a Elden Ring?
[0:38:25] <%baka_sugoi> Ring ELDEN? csbeastSetIn
[0:38:27] <%cade_calrayn> your craving for this game would kill your poker face

[0:38:54] <%kyh9> ITS SO GOOD
[0:38:55] <BaeSoora> LIMP BIZKIT MY WAY??
[0:38:56] <+Shoosler> what's the DEAL with elden ring?
[0:39:02] <%Dementedpenguin> That's gonna....  an interesting game.
[0:39:02] <%kyh9> That's a mistake I think
[0:39:03] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Safe if have VPN tho ?
[0:39:05] <%Dementedpenguin> *be
[0:39:08] <%kyh9> It's fine, keep the extra
[0:39:21] <+SveriSageAdvice> @smellthisforme nightmarish exploit found, your computer bricked, bank account gone
[0:39:23] <thunderborn32> VPNS are not fool proof stop falling for that shit
[0:39:23] <stormhawk9891> nice
[0:39:24] <tanarath> @baesoora you know it.
[0:39:24] <%kyh9> FF Origins is gonna be the next MGR, Mark my words
[0:39:27] <secret_npc> Sometimes you gotta go smooth, feels good
[0:39:28] <%unfathomarble> bless you
[0:39:28] <+YawnSong> for those asking, from soft games are having a hacking problem
[0:39:28] <+RandyFistburgers> Good push
[0:39:30] <%MyNameIsRasus> DS3 netcode allows people to run any code they want on your pc. Elden ring has same vulnerability
[0:39:42] <Profmcstevie> New stuff is wild, it breaks the expectations
[0:39:53] <Profmcstevie> Sekiro for like 3 weeks was "wuhhhh how do I win"
[0:39:54] <%JoshManVGH> @smellthisforme The multiplayer system has an exploit that allows execution of code on the users client remotley.
[0:39:59] <+polothegreatest> Oof
[0:40:00] <+Shoosler> @YawnSong ty now I remember about ds servers being offline.
[0:40:01] <CatRidder> bloodborne 2 is new stuff
[0:40:07] <+SparrowHW> its not just DS3, both 2 and 1 have the vulnerability as well
[0:40:22] <BaeSoora> @tanarath no fucking way
[0:40:23] <artoflec> sekiro had the same salt when MGR came out, people can't parry LUL
[0:40:32] <%owensleftfoot> Re4 is literally one of the greatest games ever made
[0:40:35] <+BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[0:40:35] <thunderborn32> @SparrowHW and they're not changing netcodes for elden either
[0:40:39] <vandastelka> it can never be replaced
[0:40:40] <Ghufufin> u do get to shoot napoleon in his face in re4
[0:40:42] <%unfathomarble> you're right hand comes off?
[0:40:45] <%strakillias> And it followed up CVX. Like why would you say you want more of that
[0:40:46] <+WutangchickeN> Fortnite is the best resident evil game now tho
[0:40:48] <%sniffy77> The island is a bit weak
[0:40:50] <brunoberserk> perfect/10
[0:40:51] <Profmcstevie> It took a LONG time to get to RE4, they clearly cared
[0:40:53] <%Saadi90> It is!
[0:40:53] <%kyh9> RE4 has basically remade itself every year by existing
[0:40:54] <tanarath> They've already licensed one song, why not more? @baesoora
[0:40:54] <%unfathomarble> damn it your*
[0:40:56] <secret_npc> God damn it I really gotta play it
[0:40:58] <%BigCoffee> Have you seen the new FF Strangers in Paradise trailer that dropped like 1-2 hours ago? It's absolutely fucking bonkers.
[0:40:59] <KnivesEve> so what im hearing is, no point in remaking re4 cause its already perfect
[0:41:00] <%SWFanatic> psaBork
[0:41:03] <rytisone> Remake CV Capcom
[0:41:03] <+polothegreatest> like the zeldas64? woolieMIRIN
[0:41:04] <+ScrapKingKeita> The Island is the weakest part, but its still good
[0:41:09] <scempriss> RE4 is pretty good, I wouldnt say perfect though
[0:41:21] <Profmcstevie> The weakest part in a knockout performance
[0:41:23] <foxrock8> Fortnite for best RE game today
[0:41:23] <%unfathomarble> mmmm
[0:41:26] <%baka_sugoi> Tittie WEED
[0:41:28] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Based
[0:41:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt With all it's late game flaws do you agree that dark souls 1 is the best game of all time?
[0:41:29] <%BinaryFireball> i mean almost
[0:41:31] <%owensleftfoot> wut?
[0:41:32] <secret_npc> GOTTA BEAT RE0 FIRST THOUGH 💀💀💀
[0:41:33] <%BinaryFireball> ALMOST
[0:41:34] <%patriotrenegade> He's right you know
[0:41:34] <SaltyAzteca> Almost tho
[0:41:36] <+TopTieramisu> did someone mention Baiken?
[0:41:37] <brunoberserk> ... okay ... ?
[0:41:40] <+WutangchickeN> @foxrock8 preach brother
[0:41:40] <%Daxalog> RE4 is good but some people would still like a RE2 made good. Its like how Doom is now. Some people still want an ID made Doom 2: 2.
[0:41:52] <brachydios777> wtf does that mean?
[0:41:57] <BaeSoora> @tanarath haha i got fooled - but lets be real limp bizkit would be great
[0:41:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> Elden Ring went gold today btw
[0:42:01] <T_Sasquatch> re:0 on ps4 was my first re game and i never got off the train because man fuck that
[0:42:08] <%SWFanatic> psaLiz
[0:42:10] <+Deekman> Same issue as DS2
[0:42:13] <T_Sasquatch> tetris is the best game of all time
[0:42:14] <Profmcstevie> All time? fuck no
[0:42:15] <+BallerSwagBro9k> DS3 IS
[0:42:16] <%BinaryFireball> which is the best fromsoft?

[0:50:25] <%Ne1son> MARIAGE SWORD
[0:50:25] <%Order_of_Mystery> the ringed city sword?
[0:50:30] <scrumbotime> OK
[0:50:32] <Treasure_Vault> @RetroCop87 Not saying it's bad, but I love slow combat and bounced right off Sekiro. Different strokes.
[0:50:32] <heartlesshealer> oh
[0:50:35] <%SpoonheadInExile> SpoonheadInExile subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months, currently on a 11 month streak! I feel like, if the Quantic Dream Star Wars game takes place on Coruscant, it'll be the only one where the absurdly large apartments will make sense. At least Disney will stop Cage from making Leia slave situation any more explicit. Hopefully.
[0:50:40] <vandastelka> Apparently the elden ring character creator is really good.
[0:50:42] <+BallerSwagBro9k> DAYUM BETWEEN THIS AND CONVERGENCE

[0:51:24] <%RD_NX> you can do 120hz in remastered!?
[0:51:25] <%SpoonheadInExile> Has motion blur ever not made a game worse?
[0:51:30] <+Smeagleman6> Is this after the "dark" ending of DS1?
[0:51:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> can you turn the graphics off?
[0:51:40] <+PrimalDweeb> Never motion blur.

[0:57:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Itemussy
[0:57:38] <Treasure_Vault> @TungstenViper The door existed there already, but was never used.
[0:57:45] <%patriotrenegade> Becasue time is convoluted
[0:57:45] <%IamGrapes> @FallenAngelZelos i never said Pat
[0:57:47] <BarnYardFiddler> The only umbra I remember was in elder scrolls
[0:57:50] <%0dokuro> worlds ending bruh

[0:57:58] <marrowjuice> why does your character keeping making a nutting sound
[0:57:59] <%pectusumbra> you were starting to talk about something before
[0:58:01] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Oh shit, rally!

[0:58:06] <%Dakuu75> SOMEONE loves bloodborne~ lol
[0:58:07] <%owensleftfoot> Yo what if we just put BB in ds1
[0:58:07] <$lotharrio> Slip some bloodborne into there?
[0:58:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> JUST BLOODBORNE?
[0:58:09] <+Thyzoon> Bloodborne Rally Mechanic?!
[0:58:10] <brachydios777> huh?
[0:58:11] <%Order_of_Mystery> palkia and dialga are slacking, the lazy shits
[0:58:13] <Ethel9727> Rally from Bloodborne, the message is a bit inaccurate
[0:58:14] <+xenoboost> has bb's rally system
[0:58:15] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt It is the rally system from bloodborne
[0:58:15] <HotMafia81> Ooh they took the Blordbone feature that I liked the most
[0:58:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> DarkBorne Night of the Ashen Fall
[0:58:18] <devanmuse> They did it! They actually made "SOULSBORNE"!
[0:58:18] <BarnYardFiddler> Rally
[0:58:18] <Kenyuki4> Plague Hates it!!
[0:58:19] <%dekkitout> CHAOS
[0:58:21] <%MyNameIsRasus> Plague hates this mod already LUL
[0:58:23] <IvanMistwalker> CHAOS
[0:58:24] <+AgentApe0> Is there like a story premise to this mod?
[0:58:35] <%valriot> CHAOS. MY WAY.
[0:58:39] <%FallenAngelZelos> @iamgrapes clicked on you when I meant to reply to someone else. Oops? Lol
[0:58:41] <%patriotrenegade> The impotent wailing's of Plague in the background
[0:58:44] <mrtanaka111> remember when plague said dark souls was a mistake?
[0:58:46] <Make_me_mad> I'm with plague on this one.
[0:58:54] <%TungstenoViperante> @Treasure_Vault really? so that stairway is just a portal?
[0:58:56] <+PeaceCentennial> what keeps you from being in umbrus all the time?
[0:58:59] <%RD_NX> I think 2-handed L1 or L2 does something as well
[0:59:01] <DSD24> Wow is the movement speed faster?
[0:59:01] <BliVru> Endurace is still a must
[0:59:03] <LunarRemix> @AgentApe0 It takes place after the Dark ending of DS1. Since this is a demo this is all we know for now
[0:59:04] <$lotharrio> Such extreme anime...
[0:59:09] <BarnYardFiddler> I bet plagues fav is ds2
[0:59:09] <%owensleftfoot> Plague hates fun, ofc he wouldnt like this
[0:59:10] <%Bloomingzonda> @AgentApe0 It takes place after the dark ending of ds1
[0:59:19] <Omenaire_> ???
[0:59:24] <+Jiggisnipe> what
[0:59:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> uh
[0:59:27] <+AgentApe0> Darkest timeline, I see
[0:59:27] <SaltyAzteca> NOTHIN PERSONNEL KID
[0:59:28] <%TheREALGirthMan> That was big janky right there
[0:59:28] <Dunmarkh> @PeaceCentennial can't use estus basically
[0:59:29] <Questiy> nothin personnel kiddo
[0:59:30] <mikkos522> Too much wehee wahoo for me thank you mother
[0:59:30] <DSD24> Are we Darkman?
[0:59:33] <+Mr_Reaper08> we'll not talk about that
[0:59:33] <%IamGrapes> nah dont worry about it
[0:59:34] <Laecerelius> so easier backstabbing I guess
[0:59:38] <+PrimalDweeb> That was fucky wucky, you clearly went flying off.
[0:59:39] <+SaphronBlackbourne> What exactly is Plague's problem  with these games
[0:59:40] <%KeiganOfAstora> What's the lore being faster movement and different roll?
[0:59:41] <TheDrown> damn he's good
[0:59:43] <$Futurecity10> this feels like mortal shell
[0:59:48] <BigYanno> did I not see him go off a cliff?
[0:59:50] <TheMadDemoknight> I'm so glad you don't start with a katana like in the trailer
[0:59:51] <Treasure_Vault> @TungstenViper I think it's just a reused texture in the base game. Pretty sure it's not physically close in levelspace.
[0:59:53] <brachydios777> Are you the same chosen undead?
[0:59:54] <Just_GR> Why does chat feel the constant need to bring up Plague? Am I missing something?
[0:59:54] <%Broand> big stone butthole
[0:59:58] <Make_me_mad> @SaphronBlackbourne Probably the part where they got worse with every sequel.
[1:00:00] <Coystick> I can tell by the secularity on the walls this is the Remaster
[1:00:08] <%MyNameIsRasus> @KeiganOfAstora probably consequences of becoming Dark Lord
[1:00:10] <DXLelouch24> @BigYanno he dashed back to safety
[1:00:13] <%KeiganOfAstora> Everyone loves presents!
[1:00:13] <%linSP> hidden presents?
[1:00:14] <%Broand> wow a hidden present?
[1:00:26] <%KeiganOfAstora> @MyNameIsRasus Good excuse for a lot of things actually
[1:00:28] <AlexJacobVO> I... I caught a stream live! I shall go and be happy now
[1:00:28] <DSD24> Edgar the Embraced sounds cool
[1:00:28] <+SaphronBlackbourne> 2 was worse but 3 and BB are gr8
[1:00:30] <BliVru> item
[1:00:31] <%linSP> its a consumable
[1:00:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> one-time use?
[1:00:36] <mikkos522> Because this is just the kind of fanfiction wank Plague absolutely adores
[1:00:37] <%TungstenoViperante> @Treasure_Vault oh... i thought i was misremembering the map
[1:00:37] <IronGlorfindel> Hunter tools?
[1:00:43] <Make_me_mad> 3 is terrible.

[1:29:22] <foxrock8> amazing worm ahead zoneGasm
[1:29:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> why not just put several worms together at that point
[1:29:27] <+Jack8274> Why did they double down on the worms so much?
[1:29:28] <Laecerelius> yeah those worms are hyper jank for being so prominent
[1:29:30] <+PeaceCentennial> a simple fork
[1:29:32] <linSP> just a fork

[1:29:48] <albret__einstrong> it bothers me that the bell tinging and the timer aren't connected
[1:29:50] <senfood> It is more fork. Moore fork.
[1:29:55] <foxrock8> do the fork combo
[1:29:55] <+Pleblu> @PlagueOfGripes Its still early

[1:30:15] <BigYanno> But is the fork as cool as the frying pan throwing weapons in Cinders?
[1:30:17] <Louie_Salmon> You should mess with movesets more, there's long strings if you use the same button a bunch
[1:30:18] <linSP> illusory wall rocks
[1:30:20] <@QueequegTheater> That visual is legit the coolest thing so far
[1:30:34] <gothmanmothman> dropping a fork r2 onto my mashed potato rn
[1:30:42] <+Slice_of_Kris> dw this one does not do that at all

[1:35:32] <%Mendin> Oh and then you can use the bottled boss soul to warp as a shortcut
[1:35:32] <%MyNameIsRasus> Wonder where that NPC is

[1:37:05] <Louie_Salmon> The dome
[1:37:06] <+PeaceCentennial> Hmm
[1:37:07] <+It_sjustjoey> He actually kinda sounds like a big darksoulsmin
[1:37:07] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> hey its that dude from demon souls
[1:37:07] <Coystick> Good Souls voice, he got it he has it he has Souls voice
[1:37:08] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> *LK

[1:37:10] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> MARTIN
[1:37:10] <%TheotherKristian> Kick him into the lava
[1:37:11] <HotMafia81> Sounds like LittleKuriboh
[1:37:12] <Laecerelius> He call you a BIIIIITCH
[1:37:12] <+mikesapartment> almost
[1:37:12] <brachydios777> hey kuriboh
[1:37:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> owned
[1:37:12] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> F
[1:37:13] <+TopTieramisu> hmm
[1:37:13] <+Krash_Override> Yami is that you?
[1:37:13] <jbrachob> lol
[1:37:14] <ExpressNode> That does sound like little kuriboh
[1:37:14] <$lotharrio> He was right.
[1:37:14] <+Pleblu> Hes just the master of insults
[1:37:14] <AzureHawk_Streams> ALMOST
[1:37:15] <Louie_Salmon> @PatStaresAt Not sure if you already know, but weapons have a unique dashing r1 and r2, and long strings if you mash the same button over and over in super mode
[1:37:15] <+Slice_of_Kris> out of your league
[1:37:15] <%0dokuro> so close
[1:37:19] <linSP> hmm hmmm
[1:37:20] <$12GaugeRager> He wasn't wrong
[1:37:20] <%mighty_max_t> noice
[1:37:21] <%bundle_of_herbs> you absolutely can
[1:37:22] <%TheotherKristian> I think you should kick him into the lava
[1:37:23] <BuffaTV> Not enough awkward laughing
[1:37:27] <%Dabrikishaw> I guess it does sound like Littlekuriboh
[1:37:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Kuriboh is good for this
[1:37:32] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt you can
[1:37:40] <derekpwns> psaJpeg
[1:37:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> I MARIK ISHTAR WILL LINK THE FIRST FLAME
[1:37:40] <+Krash_Override> he's totally using his Marik voice
[1:37:43] <Just_GR> @BuffaTV aozora1Eyes
[1:37:49] <Ethel9727> It is in fact LittleKuriboh
[1:37:54] <+PeaceCentennial> sick
[1:37:55] <LoneFonte> OH
[1:37:56] <albret__einstrong> @PatStaresAt You can make it with the dragonscale powder, maybe.
[1:37:58] <+Jiggisnipe> oh that's cool
[1:37:58] <%pectusumbra> you'll at least go to it's empty room
[1:38:01] <LunarRemix> But then it revives next time?
[1:38:02] <+PeaceCentennial> SICK
[1:38:02] <BigYanno> I AM MALIK BLISHTAR
[1:38:05] <%Mendin> That's the shortcut mechanic of the timeloop yeyeye
[1:38:05] <LunarRemix> Oh that's a neat mechanic
[1:38:10] <Louie_Salmon> Yeyeye.
[1:38:10] <devanmuse> So the cost of using Fast Travel is "Refight the Boss"
[1:38:11] <ExpressNode> What?
[1:38:14] <linSP> more time too
[1:38:16] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt npcs voiced by Littel Kuriboh btw
[1:38:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> thats video games
[1:38:22] <BigYanno> I actually think that's more his Yami Bakura voice
[1:38:26] <%pectusumbra> right, so you need to kill another boss so you have a flag before the time runs out
[1:38:26] <%0dokuro> thats...interesting?
[1:38:28] <%Mendin> But next time you go back in time hopefully you have the next boss soul to warp to it yeah
[1:38:28] <LunarRemix> But if you kill the next boss you won't have to
[1:38:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DEATHLOOP?
[1:38:30] <%Derbisol> Oh no where beard : (
[1:38:30] <+TopTieramisu> interesting...
[1:38:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DARKLOOP
[1:38:35] <Bealy_beal> crazy mod?
[1:38:35] <Louie_Salmon> Unless, you do good and get a later boss's soul, and skip even farther.
[1:38:43] <@QueequegTheater> But how does Xehanort figure into this nagHmm
[1:38:46] <GhostlySkunk> That buttery framerate
[1:38:47] <%owensleftfoot> YEYEYE BEST STR WEAP
[1:38:47] <+clevernamewhere> Neat mechanic
[1:38:52] <Pookiedaexzile> TimeSplitters for the Gamecube
[1:38:53] <comicalmond> Killah queen bites oh dust
[1:39:01] <Bonebagmel> It's like the modder REALLY like Arkane games
[1:39:02] <$Bane_Kaikyo> I came as soon as the Discord message  pinged me but I feel like I missed a HUGE chunk of the beginning.... time loop?
[1:39:02] <%PoohTrailSnailCooch> does this mod of dark souls come with it's own lore?
[1:39:14] <linSP> more orb!
[1:39:18] <BigYanno> @QueequegTheater Xtap
[1:39:20] <Louie_Salmon> @QueequegTheater You don't know they didn't add him as a boss, don't tempt fate
[1:39:21] <%MyNameIsRasus> it do
[1:39:22] <%Mendin> The weird NG+ reset loops makes me think Dragon Quarter even though it is amlmost entirely different
[1:39:23] <heartlesshealer> orb
[1:39:25] <+Slice_of_Kris> this one is following darksouls 1 darkending
[1:39:28] <%owensleftfoot> @PoohTrailSnailCooch yea, its a fan sequel
[1:39:28] <@ssjklyco> What about 5 dashes
[1:39:30] <%Reaped_Psyche> Reaped_Psyche subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months, currently on a 36 month streak! Friend of mine is just finishing up streaming all the Souls/born/kiro games in prep for Elden ring and this is a weird sight to see.  Hope you're enjoying it! psaSun
[1:39:32] <ExpressNode> Furi Souls
[1:39:35] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater He'd need the Key of Neberkenezer
[1:39:35] <dreu81> a ds1 mod!? aaaaaaah
[1:39:38] <%0dokuro> number go up
[1:39:41] <BurdRightsActivist> I swear I've seen the Iron Ball sprite from somewhere.
[1:39:48] <%MyNameIsRasus> 6 dashes tho
[1:39:49] <GhostlySkunk> So weird seeing you without a beard
[1:39:53] <LunarRemix> You don't stop until endurance is at 40
[1:39:54] <%MyNameIsRasus> SAVE HIMMM
[1:39:55] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater *Nebuchadnezzar
[1:39:57] <$Jaxnos> gotta dash your way to some bitches
[1:39:57] <%MyNameIsRasus> NOOOOO
[1:39:59] <linSP> F
[1:40:02] <+Slice_of_Kris> save him PepeHands
[1:40:04] <+Jack8274> And he killed himself again
[1:40:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> We'll remember you tree guy
[1:40:12] <BigYanno> I think the tree just committed die
[1:40:18] <+SveriSageAdvice> holy shit it is
[1:40:19] <%Mendin> Wait does this mean you can get multiple copies of the same weapon?
[1:40:19] <%NopeBadguy> would you recommend this if you don't have a lot of experience with ds2/3 but have beaten all the other souls @PatStaresAt
[1:40:21] <DXLelouch24> tree man doomed to die just like Aerith
[1:40:21] <Louie_Salmon> Man, there's probably gonna be a bunch of one-time enemies that do unique stuff, and you have to loop to try it again.
[1:40:24] <%0dokuro> tree man was like "I'm lost, I give up" and burns himself to death.
[1:40:26] <%pectusumbra> Is it? Or is it just Oolaciel somethign?
[1:40:35] <%Siconia> I hope you have to find out a way to save tree man
[1:40:39] <%Agami23> sounds like time isnt the only thing getting convoluted
[1:40:41] <Louie_Salmon> As long as you beat DS1 this seems fine
[1:40:43] <LoneFonte> @Bane_Kaikyo post Dark Lord ending. World is dying. Finish it before everything gets fucked
[1:40:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> it MIGHT be the blight town one
[1:40:54] <+Jiggisnipe> we haven't really seen anything either
[1:40:55] <%Mendin> The zippy dash mode makes me think Bloodborney so idk
[1:40:56] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It might just be a DS1 sequel that ignores the other two
[1:40:57] <DXLelouch24> no this is not a beginner souls fan mod
[1:40:59] <NaberiustheNefarious> dark ending randomized all the loading zones
[1:41:00] <+Jack8274> This isn't Skyrim, don't mod your first playthrough
[1:41:02] <@QueequegTheater> It seems unclear so far
[1:41:03] <%AoiRob> does that mean blighttown is on top of the darkroot?
[1:41:07] <Just_GR> Oh damn the text has some graphics added to it
[1:41:09] <%sporeian94> This game seems like it's made so people who level Dex can feel cool, unlike us Str boys who are always cool
[1:41:13] <Just_GR> Was that there in the original?
[1:41:22] <Louie_Salmon> I'd call it a DS1 epliogue even
[1:41:22] <%pectusumbra> no way
[1:41:22] <Coystick> Blighttown is now in Anor Londo
[1:41:24] <LunarRemix> Yeah it is
[1:41:24] <@QueequegTheater> @Just_GR lmao no
[1:41:27] <%pectusumbra> I'd go that way though?
[1:41:29] <FrostedZaibatsu> Would you recommend this to me? Ive only beaten Hunie Pop
[1:41:33] <@ssjklyco> Seems more like a door randomizer
[1:41:35] <%0dokuro> str bois represent
[1:41:38] <heartlesshealer> :)
[1:41:40] <%Mendin> That's the wolf ring route and not up to the butterfly tower
[1:41:40] <Minorou> wug that hall
[1:41:41] <MaybeFalco> or is it
[1:41:42] <@QueequegTheater> @FrostedZaibatsu Beat HuniePop 2 first
[1:41:43] <Just_GR> @QueequegTheater Neat
[1:41:45] <%MyNameIsRasus> @sporeian94 a fellow dragon tooth enjoyer, friend?
[1:41:47] <+PeaceCentennial> Blighttown is literally just layered on top of the abyss now
[1:41:48] <%AoiRob> this is the map for darkroot, not royal wood
[1:41:50] <phonedharpy> So what's going on in this mod?
[1:41:54] <Louie_Salmon> Pat do you want a pro tip of where the next bonfire is
[1:41:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ols age setting in
[1:42:03] <%LanceCorpralScottBukake> LanceCorpralScottBukake subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! Bark bark woof woof arff arff
[1:42:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @FrostedZaibatsu but Huniepop 2 sucks
[1:42:04] <BliVru> theres a bonfire close to the other way
[1:42:05] <@QueequegTheater> Sun is DOWN
[1:42:13] <BurdRightsActivist> @phonedharpy Fanfiction.
[1:42:28] <@QueequegTheater> @phonedharpy But DS3 was already fanfiction Kappa
[1:42:33] <+PeaceCentennial> THE IRON BALL WAS TOO ALLURING
[1:42:34] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt try dodging into attack, very useful for later, and now
[1:42:38] <+PeaceCentennial> HOOO
[1:42:39] <%0dokuro> stone man stronger then tree
[1:42:40] <FrostedZaibatsu> @FrostedZaibatsu Is Hunie pop 2 even out. I saw the side game and didnt much care for it
[1:42:42] <heartlesshealer> weapon got reach
[1:42:45] <mar_krow> Oh boi
[1:42:46] <%owensleftfoot> DUNKED
[1:42:47] <BurdRightsActivist> WHERE IS THAT BALL SPRITE FROM?
[1:42:49] <linSP> these boys are fast
[1:42:50] <LoneFonte> COOL TRACKING
[1:42:53] <+PeaceCentennial> he's scary
[1:42:56] <albret__einstrong> BIG
[1:42:59] <yukichocomilk> wtf is that weird estus
[1:43:00] <LunarRemix> @FrostedZaibatsu It has been out for a while now
[1:43:01] <%dekkitout> @FrostedZaibatsu It's been out for a year
[1:43:03] <%pectusumbra> @FrostedZaibatsu yes it's been out for a while
[1:43:10] <+XxHyde840xX> sheesh, flash step? thats something new LUL
[1:43:10] <$lotharrio> Strong legs.
[1:43:14] <%0dokuro> @PatStaresAt he's missing stone
[1:43:27] <@QueequegTheater> BabyRage
[1:43:37] <Make_me_mad> The devs cranked up the animation speeds on a lot of things. Wanted combat to be faster and more reactive.
[1:43:45] <BurdRightsActivist> Hey pat, can you take a look at the Iron Ball's sprite? I swear I've seen it before.
[1:43:46] <%owensleftfoot> Most enemies are faster now I think, makes sense considering how fast the player is now
[1:43:46] <+Jack8274> This mod feels like a Euro Jank version Dark Souls.
[1:43:53] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt this mod has the rally mechanic from Bloodborne, tho the effect is not very strong
[1:43:55] <omnishadeee> zamn is that the dark souls 3 roll
[1:43:59] <FrostedZaibatsu> Oh, honestly i played Hunie Pop for the puzzle and forgot about the girl's personalities LUL
[1:44:02] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PatStaresAt have you tried firsts with lightning bolt mode?
[1:44:12] <+PeaceCentennial> Moonlight Butterfly (With Gun)
[1:44:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> @FrostedZaibatsu chad
[1:44:19] <$lotharrio> Hey, I thought this was post-Dark ending? Why's the sky so bright?
[1:44:20] <LunarRemix> You do a lot of damage right out of the gate
[1:44:24] <CrimsonGargoyle> @PeaceCentennial god please
[1:44:27] <@QueequegTheater> What happened to the bell tower monkaS
[1:44:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Please Let Manus be on that small ass bridge
[1:44:33] <%cooldude69xx> @PeaceCentennial Glock Butterfly
[1:44:34] <+Jiggisnipe> Daylight Butterfly Kappa
[1:44:35] <%0dokuro> Sunlight Butterfly
[1:44:35] <omnishadeee> daylight butterfly
[1:44:37] <+PeaceCentennial> you could mount a .50 browning on a moonlight butterfly EASY
[1:44:41] <linSP> good grief
[1:44:46] <LunarRemix> Is that the Duke's Archives up there?
[1:44:47] <devanmuse> For a mod called "Nightfall" it's pretty sunny out
[1:44:48] <%AoiRob> is that seath's archive up there
[1:44:48] <%owensleftfoot> thats one weird butterfly
[1:44:55] <+SilverDevilfish> Dayrise
[1:44:57] <FrostedZaibatsu> @MyNameIsRasus fr i failed the dates
[1:44:57] <+Jack8274> The moon is still in the sky during the day
[1:44:59] <jumpyhugs> stair cheese OP
[1:45:00] <+slidshockingkrow> hey buddy now listen here I thought this was the dark lord ending how why comes the sun is here huh?
[1:45:04] <%sporeian94> it is
[1:45:09] <%Mendin> Reminds me of the DAughters of Ash mod where there was a gold crystal golem at the far end of the butterfly fight bridge
[1:45:09] <+Jiggisnipe> convoluted
[1:45:11] <%Mendin> As an extra Fuck U
[1:45:14] <+PeaceCentennial> oops misplaced my library
[1:45:15] <+PeaceCentennial> HELLO?
[1:45:18] <LoneFonte> HUH

[1:45:37] <Laecerelius> That hole was made for him
[1:45:39] <Pookiedaexzile> "Is that Bat giving you trouble"
[1:45:39] <@QueequegTheater> There was a moon here, it's gone now
[1:45:42] <mar_krow> Hehe
[1:45:42] <$Bane_Kaikyo> Why is the Estus like that?
[1:45:43] <brachydios777> huh
[1:46:00] <+Jack8274> That chest saved your life
[1:46:01] <%Transatlantic_Dylan> Thank u chest for taking that shot
[1:46:06] <heartlesshealer> nightfall mod demo
[1:46:08] <+Jiggisnipe> LUL what
[1:46:11] <AlexJacobVO> Huh...
[1:46:14] <+PeaceCentennial> we just left that in that box
[1:46:16] <%0dokuro> this is messing with me so much
[1:46:18] <+ScrapKingKeita> wait is this the giant's forge place?
[1:46:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> the loot table is convoluted
[1:46:19] <%pectusumbra> so that you can get out through the gate I imagine
[1:46:19] <Idon__> y'know it does make sense to put it here instead of andre randomly having it
[1:46:21] <Jail_House_Lock> why not lmao
[1:46:22] <+Jack8274> Honestly that is where the Crest should of been in  the base game
[1:46:24] <linSP> this is what happens when you choose not to commit self candle
[1:46:29] <%Dabrikishaw> Is Artorias still in the same place?
[1:46:29] <+HeroSolaire> Pat your character has dark farts emanating  from his body, is that normal?
[1:46:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> you went the wrong way
[1:46:32] <brachydios777> Maybe Gwyn had a point
[1:46:33] <+PeaceCentennial> naaaaah
[1:46:35] <%Transatlantic_Dylan> How funny would it've been if the chest popped a mimic when the mob hit it
[1:46:35] <%sporeian94> No it;s right
[1:46:37] <AlexJacobVO> Darkroot ain't so dark now
[1:46:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> but it was actually the right way
[1:46:40] <+PeaceCentennial> dont worry its fine
[1:46:42] <%Dabrikishaw> Looks like Anor Londo
[1:46:43] <AlexJacobVO> Maybe that's why it looks wrong?
[1:46:45] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Con-vo-luted!
[1:46:46] <%TheotherKristian> I would like to term this as a "DLSequel Mod"
[1:46:48] <@QueequegTheater> >A nameless, ferocious presence has made its home in the forest
[1:46:50] <@QueequegTheater> monkaS
[1:46:51] <%Agami23> space is getting abit convoluted
[1:46:51] <BuffaTV> @Just_GR Blappers together strong
[1:46:52] <%owensleftfoot> this shit is making my brain smooth
[1:46:53] <%cooldude69xx> @HeroSolaire Thats the extra Anime the mod added
[1:46:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> Gwyn was holding this back
[1:47:11] <+PeaceCentennial> weeee

[1:47:56] <jellssssss20> If they could use these new transition areas and randomize the locations, that would make for a good randomizer with items etc

[1:50:13] <%CappuccinoGuil> Pat, how you feeling about this so far?
[1:50:18] <%pectusumbra> I assume you have to find the gate opened with the crest
[1:50:29] <%RD_NX> this purple is so moody and nice
[1:50:30] <brachydios777> Also for someond who claims to be for the age of humanity, Kaath killed aloooooot of people
[1:50:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> More like Bistes the Dust than Mandom
[1:50:34] <%0dokuro> all goes into the pot
[1:50:37] <Bealy_beal> @cappuccinoguil +1 for this question
[1:50:51] <%patriotrenegade> yeah you only get three
[1:50:52] <+Jack8274> It takes exponentially more each time

[1:51:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> What happened to TEN
[1:51:04] <%AoiRob> dashes in a row take more stamina yea

[1:51:20] <%Broand> It's counting down dummy
[1:51:24] <CatRidder> @doc_ock_rokc hi when back in time

[1:51:26] <+Fetrigon> was that a clash?
[1:51:30] <%AoiRob> i think one of the devs said you need to hit softcap to do 4 in a row
[1:51:39] <%0dokuro> that tracks

[1:53:41] <%patriotrenegade> thats where you meet Solaire @PatStaresAt
[1:53:41] <subjectg> it might be a clash? Since he was attacking
[1:53:45] <pi_in_the_sci> that's where you meat Solaire
[1:53:48] <+Fetrigon> sekiro parry system?
[1:53:48] <+Jack8274> That's where soliare chills

[1:54:26] <%TheotherKristian> The world is crunching
[1:54:27] <%Broand> Oh No! I was wrong! it was the burg, all a-long! you've surely made a hollow out of me!

[1:54:59] <subjectg> seeing the greatsword moveset that fast is very unsettling
[1:55:00] <+HeroSolaire> and its same dudes same moveset
[1:55:05] <LunarRemix> 100~150 souls is less than hollows at the start of normal game
[1:55:05] <%Broand> do you keep the crest after you opened the door?
[1:55:07] <Admiral_PopnFresh> its looks like the place you find Solaire, but it might be just a different rampart/platform of the same design, that's common for city walls
[1:55:10] <AzureHawk_Streams> Are you actually clashing attacks?
[1:55:15] <%vehementvadr> isn't that the sekiro parry sound?
[1:55:25] <devanmuse> Did that Rat make a Dog noise?

[2:01:20] <%pectusumbra> so kill them fast or they come back as phantoms
[2:01:21] <%Agami23> this kinda makes sense. since kalameet was corrupting dogs around him in the base game
[2:01:21] <%shruke> psaDogchamp
[2:01:22] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> sif had pups with kalameet?
[2:01:25] <@DakotaMacDoodle> The tables have turned HOOMAN!

[2:01:44] <%dalmek> so your ghost is fucked
[2:01:46] <Laecerelius> Sif was hurt by gang violence so his pups became the gang violence!
[2:01:48] <Pookiedaexzile> FUn
[2:01:48] <%Mendin> Woofwraith
[2:01:50] <%pectusumbra> seems you take more damage in anime mode
[2:01:51] <ape_hawk> to fuck with you
[2:01:53] <%DoomUnderTheStairs> or Kalameet corrupted sifs pups
[2:01:54] <NaberiustheNefarious> it was already an irritating enemy, make it more irritating
[2:01:57] <LunarRemix> Status effects builds up through block
[2:01:57] <Treasure_Vault> Emotional devestation
[2:01:59] <heartlesshealer> to fight grinders
[2:02:00] <Sunstalker> Agami23 That wasn't kalameets doing, that was the abyss from manus seeping up
[2:02:00] <%Ne1son> Fuck you thats why
[2:02:00] <jellssssss20> Just like the big dudes guarding blightown
[2:02:00] <%WhereIsWill> that clash sound tho
[2:02:08] <+eanscrale> You're right, it should be curse

[2:02:21] <+Jiggisnipe> YEA BOI

[2:02:28] <scrumbotime> get 'em with the ol' wind up ball
[2:02:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Have you ever been hit by a shotput bal
[2:02:35] <%Agami23> @Sunstalker but the dogs that were corrupted only show up in the path to kalameet, and they have kalameets scales
[2:02:43] <%Mendin> Hey Pat check where the Stone Armor was past Alvina and see if anything's there this time
[2:02:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> Everything about the design of this mod strikes me as odd
[2:02:54] <%CatastropheCorvid> I just got here. Is that flash step just the dodge?
[2:02:57] <+eanscrale> imagine the mushroom punches do durability damage, that would be some real bullshit
[2:03:06] <%barrakuta371> psaGiefstare psaGiefrail psaDogchamp
[2:03:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gief is only two pat

[2:05:06] <%blastyoboots> Pat literally just triggered Alexa to tell me what The Great Seal of the World is
[2:05:10] <%AoiRob> the power of the limit of demo
[2:05:16] <%Bread_Assassin> I stepped away. Where was the transition point from Demon Ruins to Darkroot?
[2:05:20] <%blastyoboots> when he yelled "IS THAT SEALED BY THE GREAT LORDS POWER"
[2:05:21] <+tnomads> does this mod add new content? or just shuffle and tweak stuff
[2:05:28] <%blastyoboots> @RetroCop87 you too?!
[2:05:34] <brachydios777> that should be impossibe
[2:05:35] <%blastyoboots> no it was slightly different
[2:05:49] <%blastyoboots> "THE GREAT SEAL OF THE WORLD IS HELD BY THE" something something I stopped alexa before she went on

[2:07:48] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> spanks and kisses, that's what I show up for
[2:07:53] <+TopTieramisu> and the enemies weren't designed around BB dodges

[2:12:02] <Mojomoud> Power Piss...this is a weirdly appropriate thing to come in on
[2:12:03] <%Agami23> i constantly think about a thing i saw with D&D where someone used control water to piss super hard.
[2:12:05] <Furtive_Vulpine> BLOODY piss?

[2:14:55] <Coystick> If only there was some way to...blooock damage?
[2:14:56] <+ikantreeed> Is it another Mod that makes the game really hard?
[2:14:59] <%SWFanatic> give that undead wretch a contract

[2:15:09] <+PrimalDweeb> Okay...
[2:15:11] <Laecerelius> PWOOOOOOSH!
[2:15:26] <scrumbotime> Pat is going to go dump a bucket of paint
[2:15:28] <dreu81> i've never fried chicken - it sounds like taking a piss?
[2:15:31] <%SWFanatic> psaWrong psaOrb
[2:15:57] <Furtive_Vulpine> if your piss sounds like fried chicken you need to see a urologist
[2:15:57] <cowboy_plague_doctor> little known fact, frying a chicken is fundamentally identical to pissing
[2:15:59] <T_Sasquatch> youve never fried chicken ??
[2:16:09] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> who do you think the bigger piss boy is chat, zangief or elmo?
[2:16:36] <dreu81> i've never fried chicken
[2:16:42] <dreu81> i baked tendies
[2:16:58] <HotMafia81> Pissing sounding like frying chicken makes perfect sense the first time you hear it, but the longer you think about it, the more confusing a concept it is.
[2:17:08] <%pectusumbra> @dreu81 frying things comes with the sound of bubbling oil(liquid) so a strong piss that disturbs water/makes a froth can have a similar sound
[2:17:12] <+Orcapugs> Should’ve the podcast today instead of this low energy stream. Lol
[2:17:27] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> I mean sure, zangief can take a hell of hard piss, but Elmo was born in the piss, molded by the piss
[2:17:51] <+RandyFistburgers> Piss stream
[2:17:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> woolieONEGUY
[2:17:55] <brachydios777> You think Woolie and Pat will talk about Tucker Carlson accidently revealing his M&M fetish tomorow ?
[2:17:57] <@ssjklyco> Stream is fine

[2:18:10] <galko_chan1> HEY WHATS UP TWITCH ITS YA BOY GREG

[2:18:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> fuck off man
[2:18:10] <+slidshockingkrow> some of us rather enjoy "low energy streams"
[2:18:11] <ape_hawk> pat, how dare you not schedule your work around me???!?!?!?!?!?!?!
[2:18:15] <T_Sasquatch> this isnt low energy imo
[2:18:17] <%RetroCop87> Shoulda had the podcast next week instead of this week's 5 hour podcast
[2:18:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[2:18:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> woolieSTRIKE woolieONEGUY
[2:18:21] <%greasypete00> yeah you should've done the low energy podcast instead of this perfectly acceptable stream
[2:18:23] <dreu81> thanks for trying to explain it though @pectusumbra
[2:18:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Woolie refuses to Podcast until his demands are met
[2:18:25] <+PrimalDweeb> Knew it
[2:18:25] <HotMafia81> @Dives__ Bladdaerobics
[2:18:27] <%MidnightBurst12> awww

[2:19:11] <%mighty_max_t> This is the perfect energy stream while I'm playing through P5 Strikers
[2:19:13] <%Dementedpenguin> "If."
[2:19:13] <%RetroCop87> don't you DARE promise us anything
[2:19:14] <@ssjklyco> iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiifffff
[2:19:15] <%greasypete00> not lying
[2:19:15] <ape_hawk> IIIIIIFFFFF
[2:19:15] <Louie_Salmon> Path of the Finder
[2:19:20] <jellssssss20> Path of the Finder, yes, go on
[2:19:23] <+Mrbaconator> path of the righteous
[2:19:24] <dreu81> we need a new mgs:revengeance
[2:19:26] <ape_hawk> easy mode?
[2:19:27] <Grave_Titan_D> eff
[2:19:29] <HotMafia81> Findpather
[2:19:29] <+Orcapugs> Do it ciward
[2:19:31] <+LordGeneric> 500 nerds all screaming different build advice at the same time unasked for
[2:19:32] <ape_hawk> wrathfinder
[2:19:32] <%AgniBrandt> I'd be down for that
[2:19:34] <Treasure_Vault> I think we could handle a TASTE of it
[2:19:34] <akitanito> so less-blind stream
[2:19:37] <%pectusumbra> Sure whatever
[2:19:41] <Minorou> that sounds rad
[2:19:41] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> everyone wants this, Pat
[2:19:43] <%AgniBrandt> I'd actually be SUPER down for that
[2:19:44] <CatRidder> do kingmaker then
[2:19:45] <+PrimalDweeb> K
[2:19:46] <%BigCoffee> Paige bait class goooo
[2:19:48] <ape_hawk> do swarm-that-walks!!!!!
[2:19:49] <jellssssss20> That sounds fun
[2:19:49] <NewWillinium> That's a good idea
[2:19:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> so Paige?
[2:19:51] <rosemon5001> arent you allready that? Kappa
[2:19:51] <%Bread_Assassin> Swarm that Walks is just a murder hobo. Lich is way more interesting. ]
[2:19:52] <+Mrbaconator> swarm that walks is the coolest thing on a conceptual level
[2:19:54] <Laecerelius> I heard that swarm gets pretty gnarly so do that
[2:19:54] <%AgniBrandt> Because I'm not sure my brain will LET me do those routes
[2:20:05] <%CatastropheCorvid> Fuck that. I'm doing Lich for my first run.
[2:20:06] <jellssssss20> Which mythic path are you doing?
[2:20:15] <%pectusumbra> If I played wrath I'd go lich cause fuck NOT being a lich
[2:20:16] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt that feels like one of those streams where everyone would say to play it, but no one would show up
[2:20:31] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> So you're a liar
[2:20:35] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> cool
[2:20:36] <Reveresao> Is it worth it to skip kingmaker and just play wrath?
[2:20:44] <%CatastropheCorvid> Good choice. No Bard companions AFAIK.
[2:20:51] <%AgniBrandt> @PatStaresAt Aeon is crazy cool if you're okay with being a NARC
[2:20:51] <jellssssss20> Angel seems to goody two shoes and demons seems too straight up dick-y
[2:21:00] <+PrimalDweeb> Fuck those flame guys
[2:21:05] <scrumbotime> age of dark babbyyyy
[2:21:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> Have you heard what the Legend path does? I can't believe they implemented that.
[2:21:12] <%Ne1son> SWARM
[2:21:19] <%AoiRob> @PatStaresAt did u see the new gameplay clips for Elden Ring from taipei game show
[2:21:19] <%AncelDeLambert> the game is so LONG, though
[2:21:21] <%Bread_Assassin> I hear Devil is pretty mid.
[2:21:23] <NewWillinium> I've done most of the paths now. Devil is super underwhelming
[2:21:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> TIME OF HOLLOWS IS NOW OLD MAN
[2:21:27] <Treasure_Vault> Being a narc is dumb. Roleplaying a narc is cool.
[2:21:28] <%notsoy> some don't have as much content as others
[2:21:29] <%AncelDeLambert> I wanted to do the same, but it really is a ludicrously long game
[2:21:33] <jellssssss20> Path of the Finder, commit
[2:21:37] <CatRidder> aeon is the narcest
[2:21:40] <%BigCoffee> Still good!
[2:21:44] <%BigCoffee> Would still love it!
[2:21:45] <+theoldone001> Pat why do you hate Yukiko so much?
[2:21:47] <%Bread_Assassin> We take those, too.
[2:21:47] <ape_hawk> so a let's play?
[2:21:51] <%BigCoffee> I*
[2:21:56] <+lumporr> wtf you're nothing personelling them
[2:22:00] <Treasure_Vault> Do you follow guides while playing those games?
[2:22:01] <%BigCoffee> She's boring
[2:22:04] <%BigCoffee> like Makoto
[2:22:06] <+HeroSolaire> facts
[2:22:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yeyeye PaatiVidya returns
[2:22:07] <%cvp5127> fuck you pat
[2:22:09] <%coffeeabomination> coffeeabomination subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! So this new season of leauge has grabbed me in ways the previous didn't, wish me luck as I destroy my life with LoL
[2:22:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt pat you should pre record some streams then respond to "chat" in them
[2:22:13] <jellssssss20> I'm having a lot of trouble with builds but that sounds good enough to push through playing wrath
[2:22:13] <BaeSoora> @PatStaresAt whos best girl in p3 then?
[2:22:14] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> just do it pat, this is what we all want, this is a hat YOU want!
[2:22:18] <CatRidder> aeon is like play paragon Shepard
[2:22:20] <%RetroCop87> better than trashie

[2:22:28] <T_Sasquatch> waifu warssss
[2:22:30] <DianaTheAscian> I like Yukiko
[2:22:33] <NewWillinium> Devil is super powerful but doesn't have much storywise
[2:22:39] <Zeif00> I wish I could have dated Kanji
[2:22:41] <%mighty_max_t> So I replayed P4 within the last 3 months, Yukiko is Fine. Yosuke is STRAIGHT trash
[2:22:43] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Also her laugh sucks
[2:22:44] <%fat_burtreynolds> How ya feeling after your booster my dude?
[2:22:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yukiko cute
[2:22:46] <+HeroSolaire> This waterfall looks terrible wow
[2:22:49] <jellssssss20> To have the staff kinda guilt her into it
[2:22:50] <+TopTieramisu> fambly
[2:22:54] <%DEETRz> rise best girl, she knows what she wants
[2:22:58] <BaeSoora> Yukiko had potential, and then they just threw it into the garbage
[2:23:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> expectations
[2:23:13] <%Agami23> ladder? why ladder?
[2:23:14] <BaeSoora> and not having a choice?
[2:23:19] <dreu81> yukiko would be a good mother though -- she just needs a responsibility that she really cares about
[2:23:21] <T_Sasquatch> so far my fav persona waifus are side characters , never the main cast LUL
[2:23:25] <+TopTieramisu> monkaS
[2:23:34] <%pokefan9956> yukiko is great
[2:23:39] <BliVru> @patstaresat She sounds like every single anime female character
[2:23:41] <$SGrim> fair
[2:23:46] <BaeSoora> it is - everyone in p4 sucks
[2:23:46] <%CalderGaming> ok pat
[2:23:46] <coffeebearCafe> worst girl
[2:23:47] <+lumporr> mind-forged manacles
[2:23:47] <%RetroCop87> no, that's super Japanese
[2:23:48] <BaeSoora> girls wise
[2:23:49] <HotMafia81> None of that makes her less boring
[2:23:56] <+HeroSolaire> Where is this light reflection coming from
[2:24:00] <%Mendin> I hope a giant worm pops up

[3:00:36] <BurdRightsActivist> DS2 OVERHEADS AND DS2 HITBOXES KEKW
[3:00:40] <%Mendin> And the arena floor lighting makes it worse
[3:00:40] <%G_Thunders> It’s like there’s supposed to be a particle effect but it’s not there
[3:00:44] <Yamsy> this guy isn't very threatening
[3:00:49] <+theoldone001> Feels like too much downtime between healing. Don't like it.
[3:00:56] <%Caped_Eggy> His sword has a weird white extended blade on it that blend in with snow
[3:00:56] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.

[3:01:28] <ClimbingClifford> it's BARELY visible
[3:01:29] <%Agami23> this boss looks like it would be really really easy if a normal shield was available

[3:02:22] <+twohitgood> @CappuccinoGuil so their response to the union effort is a naked act of union busting. ok.

[3:03:51] <%CappuccinoGuil> @PatStaresAt want me to DM you the tweet with the email they sent out?
[3:03:52] <armchairmaster_> Where's the source on Raven getting split up?
[3:03:56] <%blastyoboots> yeah Pat TALKED ABOUT THAT a few streams ago, he totally predicted it
[3:03:58] <%luftraumm1> thats clever af tho
[3:04:01] <%dekkitout> @mrtanaka111 I want the timeline where the Three B's are all under MS tajC
[3:04:07] <%blastyoboots> You told us that, you called it on-stream
[3:04:14] <thatdudenamedlogan> How the fuck is he moving so fast?
[3:04:18] <zhenthrim213> SUPER SMART
[3:04:21] <%CappuccinoGuil> @armchairmaster_ a polygon journalist AND Jess Gonzales, who's been spearheading a lot of the union and strike stuff
[3:04:23] <marcomatame> was there a CSB today?
[3:04:24] <+PrimalDweeb> Microsoft could have made like, dozens and dozens of Horizon Zero Dawn quality games; for the amount of money they bought Activision Blizzard.
[3:04:26] <TheeRabbi> That i-frame was so fucking generous
[3:04:27] <mrtanaka111> @mrtanaka111 and  MS is under Disney
[3:04:27] <+theoldone001> I like all the dipshits telling Microsoft to buy Sony too so there's only one mega monopoly. These people actually exist.
[3:04:28] <%MidnightBurst12> not smart, just awake
[3:04:37] <brachydios777> Its all ActiBlizz till next summer
[3:04:38] <%za7az> @luftraumm1 Whose side are you on?? LUL

[3:05:20] <+Jiggisnipe> seems like it
[3:05:21] <DXLelouch24> yes
[3:05:22] <Just_GR> @PatStaresAt I see his sword grows a bit after transformation. It's translucent af, so we can't see it well
[3:05:23] <Fabpsi_> pretty much
[3:05:24] <jellssssss20> Do you still think that today Nintendo would still laugh out of the room anyone who came with buying talks?
[3:05:27] <susukouhai> Oh now i see the extension
[3:05:31] <%notsoy> released? is that the word we use?
[3:05:36] <%notsoy> yeah they would
[3:05:37] <BliVru> You can try the path with lava with enough health
[3:05:39] <+HolePunchLeaf> I guess people don't remember the Halloween documents or the anti-monopoly stuff MS blundered into in the mid 00's, they've literally never been the "good guys"
[3:05:39] <+twohitgood> ***
[3:05:40] <zhenthrim213> @thatdudenamedlogan by way of exucution
[3:05:46] <Fabpsi_> and so fast

[3:05:51] <DXLelouch24> unless you wanna try to get to Lost Izalith its the end, but its empty
[3:05:53] <%dekkitout> Why is this transition so tight
[3:05:56] <FrostedZaibatsu> Power of the PS5
[3:06:06] <%notsoy> there is japanese legislation against foreign companies buying controlling shares of sufficient-size companies
[3:06:10] <taylorpony> its the same animation as applying pine resin
[3:06:11] <+polothegreatest> Its PTSD for"xbx has no games"
[3:06:22] <%RetroCop87> Pat, I just @'d the tweet
[3:06:23] <%Agami23> i just realized. does this mod even have sorceries and miracles and stuff?
[3:06:36] <albret__einstrong> Weird that the sun is out when there isn't one anymore.
[3:06:38] <Fabpsi_> so far: flawless
[3:06:46] <+Jiggisnipe> @Agami23 think they are consumables
[3:06:47] <+shry7> his sword is now larger, just transparent
[3:06:50] <+retrohazard> @notsoy Unfortunately that has also led to some stagnation here as it significantly stifles foreign investment.
[3:06:50] <thatdudenamedlogan> XBOX is never getting into the Southeast Pacific market like Sony or Nintendo, so their goal is just to be big enough to dominate the US and Europe.
[3:06:54] <taylorpony> dont get penisy
[3:06:55] <Pookiedaexzile> All those Xbox exclusives are coming heavy
[3:06:57] <Laecerelius> Yeah I just realized that Pat's playing a class with a faith scaling weapon but no actual faith spells

[3:09:07] <%bevyrage> as pat, stares at dark souls nightfall demo~ as pat~ stares at
[3:09:10] <%CappuccinoGuil> Dude, this really rubs the wrong way considering Raven asked ABK to recognize their union by Tuesday, and here in Brazil is 12:00 AM, AKA Tuesday
[3:09:22] <sun312772> @lumporr makes sense
[3:09:31] <ejackalope> do you think you can parry him?
[3:09:32] <%bevyrage> how good will this stream be~? crazy talk history~!
[3:09:45] <%bevyrage> stares at! (awoohoo~)
[3:09:56] <LunarRemix> When he hits you it feels like he didn't
[3:09:57] <TheeRabbi> no one needs to unionize more than workers who are told not to unionize
[3:09:58] <%notsoy> STINGER
[3:10:00] <LunarRemix> Like it has no impact
[3:10:02] <%sniffy77> pat got stabbo
[3:10:04] <+PrimalDweeb> I think you need a break.
[3:10:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> That stab is so fast
[3:10:15] <TheeRabbi> stab in the heart but it feels so good
[3:10:18] <%MyNameIsRasus> 6

[3:10:30] <Furtive_Vulpine> you DIE
[3:10:31] <DXLelouch24> time resets
[3:10:32] <%dekkitout> Bad end?
[3:10:33] <%Divryne> You die obviously
[3:10:35] <DXLelouch24> MAJORAS MASK STYLE
[3:10:35] <Ethel9727> It resets like the pendant

[3:10:48] <Fabpsi_> yea leveling is barely a thing
[3:10:54] <Yamsy> you've lost like 12k souls
[3:11:10] <%MyNameIsRasus> @BallerSwagBro9k what's ligma?
[3:11:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> I wonder if it's only the demo that's tuned like that
[3:11:29] <%SpoonheadInExile> This mod gives you a "nothing personal" transversal?
[3:11:31] <DXLelouch24> @PatStaresAt time resets and whichever boss soul you have you dont have to fight the next loop
[3:11:34] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> psaBork
[3:11:36] <%cooldude69xx> This is such an unimpressive boss compared to the ghost wolf pack before him.
[3:11:37] <%baka_sugoi> psaBork psaBork
[3:11:39] <DXLelouch24> you keep everything tho
[3:11:42] <Fabpsi_> probably, right? I mean it would make a little sense to get the usual "take a lot of time for leveling stuff" out of the equasion
[3:11:43] <ambiganti> this guy has a cool ass design
[3:11:57] <%captain_thickthighs> use your balls
