[0:11:27] <%Ninestempest> I would say that we should listen to the people who made the game, and they have expressed that they want people to experience their work, even if it isn't fair labor @AngriestPat
[0:11:27] <Splendeh> I want to play the cowboy game vv bad.
[0:11:27] <narusao> it's pretty simple... management and investor owner class is scum

[0:12:06] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I actually hate cowboys, for reasons based on the fact that I was raised to think that I should be a cowboy and that if I'm not then I'm just a shitty city person who likes to bathe frequently
[0:12:06] <+sana_kan> I think the employees just said raising awareness about how they've been treated is the best course of action, on account of the whole bonus thing

[0:45:45] <%Jpdodds> @demonhunter790 The hours worked and productivity generated by American and Japanese workers are actually highly comparable with fewer suicides on the American sides because Americans have an actual notion of bouncing back from failure
[0:45:45] <+Valison> goblin slayer meh, but the manga has good art

[0:54:03] <%On_Target> because everybody knows Rockstar is super bad about working conditions
[0:54:04] <$GohanEgret> look up the stuff about rockstar san diego from like a decade ago
[0:54:08] <+Shaggnar> They weren't working 100 they were working 99 LUL
[0:54:11] <KatabolicRage> rockstar is also well known for cutting people out the credits if they quit mid-development
[0:54:12] <+simpo98> no :D @strangelee
[0:54:15] <prettypatties97> Big lies for big overworking
[0:54:25] <SiameseSneeze> Man Dated Kappa

[0:54:31] <+thesw1tch> working absurd hours to not even get in the credits. rockstar... I can't even
[0:54:32] <Desertfishing> the implication
[0:54:32] <%On_Target> they were told they could work 80 hours or maybe not have a job next year
[0:54:33] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Well I mean if you love your job is it REALLY working?
[0:54:33] <Mr_Strut> Because of the implication
[0:54:35] <jobbedbone> S O F T
[0:54:35] <@Squishy3> there's also an indepth article by jason schreir on kotaku about it that was also in the works before they even made the 100 hour work weeks quote
[0:54:37] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> (Yes)
[0:54:39] <+cvp5127> companies hate crunch

[0:58:33] <%On_Target> People were apathetic long before SOuth PArk existed
[0:58:34] <+beatsilver> How long have i been gone? What’s with the new background?
[0:58:34] <SiameseSneeze> Sure, it's South Parks' fault Kappa

[1:17:10] <Burritomoose> monkaS
[1:17:11] <BeefyQueefer> The "double tap to follow" is a fantastic mechanic, because it allows them to control how long it takes you to get somewhere in an open area, thus allowed for non-locked in cutscenes between the characters
[1:17:15] <aerdus01> fun fact: the size of balls tells you how hot it is
[1:17:16] <%thunderdutch> Prequel
[1:17:18] <jacknerik> SASQUATCH

[1:50:45] <+timblenaut> this is not how wolves work.........

[1:50:48] <%Sotetsu> Pat is a cat person.
[1:50:48] <%AncelDeLambert> That was some Vash bs
[1:50:48] <+mimikyu92> ever since my family got chickens, i've lost all affection for small woodland animals. racoons are cute, right? wrong, vicious killers. coyotes are shitty wolves, right? wrong. coyotes are the devil himself
[1:50:49] <%sleepy_coffee> A Cowpokes worst enemy, snowy trees!
[1:50:50] <Josef_Stryker> Ah I see they did
[1:50:51] <$RaikenTB> Pat has more trigger discipline.

[1:50:53] <+GN93> shoot John. change the future
[1:50:54] <+SinisterBroccoli> can you shoot your horse in the back of the head?
[1:50:54] <+Ches_Neckbeard> ya know what I appreciate about these doggos design? no death whine
[1:50:55] <Josef_Stryker> So was it wolves or bears?
[1:50:55] <%PomegranateKing> Get a horse mounted doggo... The wild went equivalent of a metal gear
[1:50:56] <Bouldus> cuz wolves would totally chase you down like that
[1:50:59] <$GohanEgret> wolves
[1:51:03] <%Jpdodds> @BeefyQueefer nfection was still VERY touch and go. It still is
[1:51:03] <Habblewater> Skifree
[1:51:05] <Desertfishing> only getting bit in cut scenes kill
[1:51:09] <sosuke5> ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE DAMN HORSE, CJ
[1:51:10] <arcaderabbit48> That doesnt work
[1:51:15] <+tigerfang86> YA GET IT
[1:51:17] <+TheImmortal70> Yes, let's ride in the frozen arctic water with our HORSES
[1:51:17] <XenoDweeb> Holy shit, it really IS a house-dungeon, huh?
[1:51:19] <DarkKnightGrave> PLOT ARMOR
[1:51:20] <cookery> Put John down before he turns into a werewolf
[1:51:20] <prettypatties97> I feel like wolves would have backed off after they lost two in that first fight
[1:51:22] <Archer336> Don't let John touch that River, it'll be over before it starts.
[1:51:27] <Kataguro> Wait, what? They're retconning it?
[1:51:29] <deviljhojho94> sounds like he is dying LUL
[1:51:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> Won't that just give his horse's frostbite?
[1:51:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Quick, get him to the elves!
[1:51:37] <deviljhojho94> LIVE RETCON
[1:51:38] <+TheImmortal70> It totally would
[1:51:38] <Habblewater> Attacked by THE YETAY
[1:51:39] <StrawberryPantsu> Wolfs apparently have a bight twice as strong as German Shepard's
[1:51:41] <Josef_Stryker> Did John get clawed in the face?
[1:51:43] <HoIlywood_SN> @Kataguro what was the original reason?
[1:51:43] <Bouldus> @prettypatties97 they would have backed off after nobody ran in the first part
[1:51:43] <+TheImmortal70> The horses would be fuckin dead
[1:51:44] <Tucker0603> HE GOT IT FUCKING A WOLF
[1:51:44] <+GN93> @cookery lol
[1:51:49] <+SergeantSov> John's doin a big slump
[1:51:50] <KatabolicRage> even small dogs can fuck you up
[1:51:51] <+GreatBrightBlack> horses are immune to freeze status
[1:51:54] <dyepigeon> man, can't wait for yoda to show up
[1:51:54] <Alseid> suddenly, TIGREX
[1:51:54] <%PomegranateKing> And they all died. The end.
[1:51:56] <+NWR_James> Pat's prison walls suit this game
[1:51:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat they're running from the Nazgul, DUH!
[1:51:56] <nobody12349> Was the retcon really needed?
[1:51:58] <Kataguro> RDR1 talked about it being a bear claw I'm pretty sure. Maybe I'm misremembering
[1:52:01] <DarthCiDulous> @bouldus yes, they are well known for it. Most predators will as it's a case of feed or die
[1:52:01] <+Saltima> I bet the wolves are for easing you into horse combat
[1:52:02] <+GN93> mech horse dont feel cold
[1:52:04] <Hommando> Abigail got her pre-game on before John got back
[1:52:04] <Desertfishing> everyonedead
[1:52:04] <+hoenhime344> if anyone thinks john dies in this game I just dont know what to tell you
[1:52:08] <42nfl19> wait retcon? what was the original story for the scar?
[1:52:12] <KatabolicRage> to be fair a bear will take your fucking head off in one swipe
[1:52:12] <bleugh> TIME PARADOX
[1:52:13] <prettypatties97> @bouldus that's actually a very good point
[1:52:14] <@Fuggins4U> Red Dead Animal Crossing
[1:52:15] <KatabolicRage> so it was never realistic
[1:52:15] <+Proposition__Joe> the thing about wolves is that they're going to come back with their spears and pitchforks and get you in your sleep
[1:52:15] <Huntercd> Was he really fucking an animal?
[1:52:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> idiotas
[1:52:19] <XenoDweeb> Nice that the doggos didn't get you, that'd create a time paradox :D
[1:52:19] <deviljhojho94> IDIOTAS
[1:52:21] <Bouldus> @DarthCiDulous exactly
[1:52:23] <Hidashi13> john fucking a bear canon
[1:52:24] <god__of__lore> There was no original story. That guy was wrong
[1:52:25] <deviljhojho94> TIMELINE RESTORED!
[1:52:26] <echodrone81> he fucked that wolf. he got mauled by a pack, but by god he was going to finish.
[1:52:26] <%BioApple> he got swiped by a bear in the same location later
[1:52:26] <%PomegranateKing> Have the horse poop. Then smear the feces in his wounds. I hear that's good for... something.
[1:52:28] <mercado94> IDIOTAS

Lets say these are smaller deer (does) they are both at Minimum 50 lbs pure meat not counting all the extra bits, (hide bones innards) et. This is a very big score for them. A few days?

[3:00:46] <%MechaBaphomet> Worth the 100 hour work weeks
[3:00:46] <+yetionayacht> IT TOTALLY MATTERS

[3:01:01] <BeefyQueefer> the shrinking horse balls make those 100 hour weeks worth it to the devs
[3:01:02] <prettypatties97> an employee's soul was sacrificed for horse balls
[3:01:02] <twistedj3ster> processing power wasted on horse balls
[3:01:03] <+lethallunacyx> Says you! I need my ball realism

[3:23:59] <stropbopadopolis> pinkerton > blue album
[3:24:02] <KatabolicRage> so yeah
[3:24:03] <Heyestus> more pointless than telling the before story?
[3:24:05] <element_of_loyalty> LSD
[3:24:07] <+PeaceCentennial> My main problem with it is that we know how the Dutch Gang resolves so it's really weird for any scene with tension considering certain characters
[3:24:08] <element_of_loyalty> DRUGS
[3:24:08] <LordOfThePoultry> was arthur in rdr1?
[3:24:09] <mr_slaide> @lotharrio You might not be the Somoa islands, but still shameful.
[3:24:13] <Heyestus> just make it about different people
[3:24:13] <DarkKnightGrave> I want to play as Jack tho.
[3:24:14] <+SparkAfterDark> by setting it in WW1 I guess
[3:24:19] <KatabolicRage> by the time you control jack, ww1 is starting
[3:24:24] <+tigerfang86> CRAFTING
[3:24:25] <KatabolicRage> there's a newpaper about the "european war"
[3:24:26] <GyroBigHugs> I think the point isn't that it's before RDR1, is that it's still about the same characters
[3:24:26] <%AncelDeLambert> 1910, eh?
[3:24:26] <Lord_Troxvon> @AngriestPat So apparently the Pinkerton Detective Agency is still around today and they are still assholes
[3:24:27] <element_of_loyalty> runover the deer
[3:24:28] <gyrogogozeppeli> What I don't get is why they didn't just set this in the early 1800's
[3:24:29] <+Diamond_Dynamo> Because of when RDR1 was set, it wouldn't have been possible to set it after. I would've rathered it be unrelated, but meh
[3:24:30] <pillowwasp> I didn’t care for jack
[3:24:33] <+PeaceCentennial> Like if it was before RDR but with a completely different cast
[3:24:34] <+Virokwet> they probs werent gonna make a red dead 2 so might as well be a prequal

[4:18:33] <KatabolicRage> also see one piece for the WORST excesses of filing time in the anime
[4:18:33] <mercado94> read World Trigger
[4:18:33] <element_of_loyalty> Pat savors every line.
[4:18:36] <KatabolicRage> half of every episode is recap
[4:18:37] <CaptainKarite> you could read all of one piece in like 5% of the time the show takes
[4:18:37] <majindusto> Pat is Slow
[4:18:41] <Dio_TR> Has Paige LOST SHELLMO tho
[4:18:43] <%JaydenSai> @AngriestPat Hey, just curious, have you looked at Swery's game? I know Swery asked you guys if you wanted a code

[4:18:56] <grayjammer> Human Beings Can't Multitask
[4:18:57] <Kataguro> Didn't Pat tell us not to do that with LPs?
[4:18:58] <element_of_loyalty> NOI ONE CAN MULTI TASK DUMMY
[4:18:59] <derap41> Have AI autoread while the pages flip
[4:18:59] <Bouldus> lol
[4:18:59] <efratzy> so he doesnt even watch anime, he listen to people talk in a language he doesnt understand
[4:19:00] <+tigerfang86> Persona shows us the ONLY WAY TO READ BOOKS is to read it when you get a seat on the subway

[5:37:36] <FracturedImage> H O W C A N T H I S B E
[5:37:39] <prettypatties97> I'm like freaking out for real, and like quietly wheeze laughing
[5:37:53] <DukeMoose> fir example. Self-Defence = Gud. looting the corpse of the slain would-be killer and wearing his hat and skin as a mask = Bad. sinple stuff
[5:38:01] <OkamiDude15> FOR REAL? woopsR
[5:38:13] <%IWantMyFamilyBack> I think Pat sees a corpse as a crate of goods up for grabs with no moral repercussions . even when ssaid corspe is still alive
[5:38:22] <$Dutchpotato> ^
[5:38:23] <majindusto> PAT: WHY OH WHY CAN'T I STOP DOING CRIME? IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE!!!
[5:38:25] <Hidashi13> how is p5 on the ps3 Kappa

[5:39:15] <Desertfishing> Matt and Woolie need to stop Pat from his criminal ways
[5:39:30] <%king_strongstyle> Pat wants to be a part of cryme time
[5:39:33] <+Reizie_Etherealm> Is this Cryme Tyme?

[5:40:06] <majindusto> Truly this it the CRIMETYME experience
[5:40:08] <Bouldus> Pat doesnt understand the Law who knew? Kappa
[5:40:08] <DukeMoose> can we all say that lawman reaction/arrest was so good thou?
[5:40:09] <suikudo> Can you believe it!?
[5:40:09] <+Ell1ot> People don't like it if you do crimes
[5:40:13] <Desertfishing> true
[5:40:14] <mercado94> this man bought a hose
[5:40:16] <mercado94> *house
[5:40:19] <Them00n> Stop looting people and running them over with your (stolen) horse.
[5:40:20] <prettypatties97> Stop stealing horses, and stop looting corpses in front of witnesses
[5:40:28] <suikudo> Some dingus is canada let him buy a house
[5:40:41] <%king_strongstyle> Just remember the wire training pat
[5:40:47] <$Dutchpotato> well red dead 2 is going for realism pat
[5:40:48] <PSI_Guy95> It's a brave new wild west
[5:40:48] <%Agami23> your right pat. this game isnt like that other game
[5:40:49] <Bouldus> no you had a huge bounty
[5:40:50] <@JustinianKnight> you ran them over lol
[5:40:58] <+SparkAfterDark> Pat did you actually buy this house, or did you just move in and kill everyone that tried to stop you?
[5:40:59] <%drabberfaun535> YOU KEEP SHOOTING PEOPLE
[5:41:01] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat sup nerd
[5:41:03] <$TheCrispyBoi> it was his horse
[5:41:03] <%JaydenSai> Pat, you killed people in FRONT of other people
[5:41:04] <rytisone> realism is very important to R*, now off to a drifting horse
[5:41:05] <Bouldus> YOU ALREADY HAD THE BOUNTY BEFORE PUTTING THE MASK ON
[5:41:05] <SeventyForce> But they DIDN'T
[5:41:06] <pshuuu> mask doesnt make you invisible
[5:41:06] <DukeMoose> because you Continue to wear the mask!
[5:41:06] <majindusto> How do i resist these urges to do crime and murder
[5:41:07] <%IWantMyFamilyBack> cause you were already a baddie?
[5:41:07] <Avolver001> They didn't they were investigating
[5:41:07] <+Roundelay11> Guess what? Hovering over a dead guy in a mask is pretty suspicious
[5:41:08] <suikudo> THEY SEE YOU IN A MASK SHOOTING PEOPLE
[5:41:08] <Desertfishing> the cops watched you
[5:41:12] <majindusto> ?
[5:41:13] <+Robo_Wizard1> Have you considered: not doing crime
[5:41:15] <%MagickBurritoh> 1111
[5:41:15] <Bouldus> wtf lol
[5:41:15] <+deity_majora> They didn't you attacked after wtih the law near
[5:41:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> They didn't until the law men came by and saw you in the mask
[5:41:17] <%nitronLVIII> the cops were already there tho
[5:41:20] <$Dutchpotato> they didn't "know it was you" they knew you were a blood thirsty killer that needed to be gunned down
[5:41:21] <TheBlankAce> A mask doesn't stop people seeing a masked person do crimes
[5:41:21] <%Paralurx> THEY WERE TOLD A MASKED MAN SHOT PEOPLE
[5:41:23] <%king_strongstyle> Remember your horses dick changes during weather.. we goin for realism
[5:41:24] <prettypatties97> They then know to look for someone wearing a mask! TAKE OFF THE MASK AFTERWARDS (idk if that actually works)
[5:41:25] <%thebetterbard> but then you didnt get clear and take the mask off
[5:41:27] <Avolver001> you were near the crime scene
[5:41:27] <Mr_Strut> Maybe they matched the MO to a recent mass murderer.
