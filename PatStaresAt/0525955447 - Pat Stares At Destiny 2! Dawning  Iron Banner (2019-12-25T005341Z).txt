[0:12:10] <+konekoryugamine> Fuck my typing
[0:12:11] <%D00msDayDan> who the fuck's calling destiny pay to win?
[0:12:12] <%Ipsenscastle> Does Paige still need shirt designs?
[0:12:15] <Soliloquy123> Symmetry's fucking nuts actually

[0:12:19] <SMuffinMan> Thursday?

[0:12:23] <betrayed_llama> its 25 dollars because forsaken
[0:12:23] <+konekoryugamine> @Aydarkzero Isn't that an SCP?
[0:12:25] <Tucker0603> symmetry is great
[0:12:30] <%Alpha8087> Telesto is great!
[0:12:36] <samuel1ful> symmetry is awesome Pat you nerd
[0:12:37] <%demegodz> Yes
[0:12:45] <%wannabemoogle> Debatable?
[0:12:46] <yourliteraldog> It's fun shoot shoot
[0:12:46] <%AncelDeLambert> the answer is yes
[0:12:47] <Aydarkzero> @konekoryugamine you aren't wrong and i'm sure it will try and kill us or something eventually
[0:12:48] <+Shackle_Rustyford> as someone who hasn't played D2 since release, is it something worth getting into?
[0:12:48] <+SOULSILVERAERO> It would be both
[0:12:49] <ExpressNode> I guess cutting ties with Activision made the game better?
[0:12:49] <mrcelab> Its addicting?
[0:12:55] <Calek> Let me explain
[0:12:57] <GarbageQueenEllie> Elmo's fur will launch a market empire
[0:12:59] <Aydarkzero> grind good have fun w/ friends
[0:13:01] <%AncelDeLambert> the story mode of Destiny was great, shame they HIDE IT
[0:13:03] <yourliteraldog> Wish I had friends to play it with
[0:13:03] <+konekoryugamine> @Aydarkzero Swish swish
[0:13:05] <AMajorTom> How many descriptions from the song abut the Grinch also apply to Pat?
[0:13:06] <%demegodz> apatBig apatHoldon
[0:13:10] <Manwad> grind loops must be rad as shit
[0:13:10] <Senselessvirus> Hey Pat how's the EDZ sundial treating you? It's been glitched 9 times out of 10 when I go to it.
[0:13:13] <%mistermastergreg> NUMBER GO UP
[0:13:15] <+konekoryugamine> Dead Rising was fun tho
[0:13:16] <%Dementedpenguin> Oof
[0:13:25] <%nofestu2> Mega busted
[0:13:25] <+konekoryugamine> And Dead RIsing 2 was even more fun because Frank West
[0:13:28] <%demegodz> @Senselessvirus He's completed all oblisks
[0:13:30] <Aydarkzero> like the foam finger gun from Dead Space Pog
[0:13:44] <+konekoryugamine> That sounds like a motion sickness nightmare.
[0:13:46] <%Dementedpenguin> OH GOD, I DID THIS...... Why NotLikeThis
[0:13:46] <%thegreatbambe> thegreatbambe subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[0:13:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO IT ON STREAM LUL
[0:13:53] <Soliloquy123> You have to kill literally the entire population of Willamette
[0:13:54] <+SOULSILVERAERO> Thanks for the Haha2020 @thegreatbambe
[0:13:55] <$FrogROOT> what
[0:13:56] <+Shackle_Rustyford> Thanks for the HahaThisisfine @thegreatbambe
[0:13:57] <Aydarkzero> i only ever played Dead Rising 2
[0:14:02] <%thegreatbambe> nice bros
[0:14:02] <%Chatterbox1991> @angriestpat 7 day survivor is way harder to get
[0:14:04] <%Ipsenscastle> I can't stand that stuff. FFIX has a terrible achievement for killing 10000 enemies
[0:14:07] <ExpressNode> Disgaea kind of personifies grind to me and FUCK if I wasted so many hours
[0:14:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> Similar to that, is why I get burnout from games
[0:14:11] <+konekoryugamine> Wait 4 hours in-game or 4 hours real time?!
[0:14:13] <chambatron> Thanks for the HahaThisisfine @thegreatbambe
[0:14:14] <%valriot> I feel like grinding by default involves some form of monotony, especially when it's just "rolling for RNG loot"
[0:14:17] <Reanimator83> I got that achievement NotLikeThis
[0:14:19] <TioXyco> go in, do it, go out
[0:14:21] <%ShaneWhite> Looking Sharp by the way Pat did you clean up for the Holidays?
[0:14:23] <Dragon_agito> hi pat how are you?
[0:14:27] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PEW PEW PEW
[0:14:29] <+necrocannibal2> @konekoryugamine 4 hours real time
[0:14:32] <Aydarkzero> i forgot Pat bought an Xbox elite controller LUL
[0:14:32] <black_pariah> i've been grinding warframe mastery and like seeing the number go up
[0:14:34] <+konekoryugamine> Oh fuck that noise.
[0:14:44] <%Ipsenscastle> Safi'Jiva's some good ass grinding
[0:14:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> its all about the number go up
[0:14:46] <%TheQButton> Happy Holidays everyone!
[0:14:47] <$FrogROOT> good noises
[0:14:49] <Aydarkzero> but with friends!
[0:14:49] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[0:14:53] <samuel1ful> Destiny: what's that over there? is that the script?
[0:14:53] <Soliloquy123> In the process of grinding, you are shooting gun and punching man, and that's fun
[0:14:58] <%Garthunox> @ipsenscastle noice name, jump rope tho
[0:15:01] <+Shackle_Rustyford> so, as someone who hasnt touched the game since reaching level cap on release, is it a... fun? game?
[0:15:01] <+necrocannibal2> ok, I understand it now
[0:15:04] <+Ghostfaceninja53534> positive feedback loop
[0:15:12] <$FrogROOT> yeah
[0:15:14] <%NWR_James> "I enjoy...grind" Pat
[0:15:16] <+konekoryugamine> @AngriestPat I feel like a hypocrite saying this, but I have the patience to play 1,000 floors in DMC2 but not enough patience to do donuts for 4 hours.
[0:15:19] <Aydarkzero> go see Saint-14 cause he's rad!
[0:15:19] <%Ipsenscastle> @Garthunox JUMPROOOOPEEE >:(
[0:15:22] <%Garthunox> @angriestpat do I need to buy all expansions or just shadowkeep?
[0:15:25] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Been meaning to ask, how many raids have you done? If any, that is. @angriestpat
[0:15:25] <%Valdorick> The grind in MonHun comes from your wepaon sharpness going down apatSmug
[0:15:25] <ExpressNode> Number be imaginary number mean get bigger
[0:15:29] <Aydarkzero> Space Grandma
[0:15:36] <%demegodz> All expansions
[0:15:36] <%D00msDayDan> no word from fenchurch
[0:15:37] <%valriot> @angriestpat Daily and weekly modifier rotations help keep things fresh, melee modifier when playing Titan is the best thing ever
[0:15:38] <%OhioNitsud> forsake
[0:15:38] <Soliloquy123> Gotta buy Forsaken
[0:15:47] <+konekoryugamine> Guess the DMC2 stuff gets sandbagged.
[0:15:48] <+konekoryugamine> Meh.
[0:15:49] <+Shackle_Rustyford> can you catch the storyline from release until now, if you only played since release?
[0:15:51] <%trustycoyote> trustycoyote subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[0:15:51] <Zebroneath> There's Forsaken as well
[0:15:52] <$FrogROOT> pat whats your war lock build
[0:15:54] <+Shackle_Rustyford> or is that like, lost content
[0:15:55] <chambatron> you have to buy this new season to play the sundial
[0:15:58] <%DedlokPM> Shadowkeep and Forsaken are the only ones you have to buy. but forsaken is better imo
[0:15:58] <%JojoPiero> JojoPiero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Stumbo, gonna be missing Stream to play MHW, speaking of which is SnS any good or am I kidding myself by using it when something else is way better?
[0:15:58] <+konekoryugamine> OHGNT TEBKSKD
[0:16:01] <Aydarkzero> you don't need to buy Forsaken but you SHOULD buy Forsaken
[0:16:03] <$FrogROOT> theres a bundle on steam
[0:16:06] <Soliloquy123> Absolutely buy Forsaken, and I'd wait on Shadowkeep because they're adding more stuff to it eventually and right now I don't think it's worth it
[0:16:08] <samuel1ful> the new seasonal expansion, Season of the Endless Grind. lol
[0:16:10] <yourliteraldog> do you need the expansions for the season passes?
[0:16:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Sellout Time
[0:16:14] <%Garthunox> @konekoryugamine theres a dmc2? I thought it went 1 3 4
[0:16:17] <%Garthunox> 5
[0:16:18] <%Ixiah> why cant i skip the story with other classes when i finished them with my first ? :(
[0:16:18] <%Dementedpenguin> @konekoryugamine There was also the risk of miscalculating your pattern and get stuck on foot in the parking lot and dying 4Head
[0:16:23] <Aydarkzero> @yourliteraldog you get a free version of the pass
[0:16:23] <$FrogROOT> yeah
[0:16:28] <%Baekon01> apatHat
[0:16:36] <Zebroneath> Btw, Shadowkeep is on sale on PSN this week.
[0:16:39] <%AncelDeLambert> just spend the monies on the game that tells you NOTHING
[0:16:42] <%Ipsenscastle> @JojoPiero SnS has some cool shit, don't try to minmax everything it sucks the fun out of getting weapons and equipment
[0:16:49] <%demegodz> Treat yourself this Christmas
[0:16:54] <Reanimator83> Isn’t shadowkeep on sale right now?
[0:16:59] <$FrogROOT> destiny 2 upgrade edition should still be on sale on steam
[0:17:00] <+Shackle_Rustyford> is the story worth 38 bucks
[0:17:06] <%valriot> The season pass prices are really negotiable
[0:17:08] <%Typhaeon> It's free exotics SeemsGood
[0:17:12] <+killer_squid1990> Unlike battle passes the season pass actually unlocks gameplay
[0:17:12] <+konekoryugamine> Wait what
[0:17:17] <%AncelDeLambert> most of the story is free
[0:17:26] <%AncelDeLambert> absolutely play the free story, it's REALLY good
[0:17:28] <%D00msDayDan> not just story, you're also buying raids and exotic quests
[0:17:28] <+konekoryugamine> Further fuck that noise.
[0:17:32] <Aydarkzero> chat lets be honest you could do a whole lot worse w/ $10
[0:17:33] <+konekoryugamine> I'd rather play Mass Effect.
[0:17:40] <$Dakuu75> Sry, gotta save my buck-a-roos for iceborn on PC
[0:17:41] <%valriot> I spend more on lunch that the season pass
[0:17:44] <%JojoPiero> @ipsenscastle Sounds good to me
[0:17:46] <+konekoryugamine> What.
[0:17:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its THE WORST

[0:18:08] <%demegodz> Ah the movie
[0:18:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Made some gingerbreads earlier. Some of the most treacherous dough I've ever had to deal with. But it tasted good.
[0:18:13] <samuel1ful> Destiny has the Dark Souls story problem of, there's actually alot of story, you just have to find it.
[0:18:17] <%AncelDeLambert> who are these "crowds" that like this? It seems like it's made just for artsy fartsy types
[0:18:18] <mrcelab> Is the armor here like fashion souls, or it does make big difference?
[0:18:21] <ExpressNode> So a Furry movie?
[0:18:24] <%wannabemoogle> Oh thank god I'm not the only one
[0:18:28] <Huntercd> Is Taylor Swift hot as a cat?

[0:19:01] <%wannabemoogle> That movie tanked super hard
[0:19:01] <%Shackle_Rustyford> kojima is pushing MONSTER
[0:19:06] <%Ipsenscastle> If Cats was just about weird freakazoid cats it'd be fine, but it's all crazy and metaphysical and shit

[0:51:02] <+Imn0tacop> For Christmas, I got and built my dad a 7.1 home theater setup with a 4K tv, gaming PC, and roku. I got my mom a Roomba, Alexa, a Gaming chair, and some other stuff to let her play her MMOs all comfy-like. I got a pair of boots....
[0:51:12] <%valriot> Use Arianas Vow

[0:51:24] <%yourliteraldog> jooose
[0:51:26] <+necrocannibal2> ouch
[0:51:27] <+NickyDynamite> No seasonal mods on exotics is a big mistake I think.
[0:51:28] <maebold> donk
[0:51:28] <Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat are you going for the Savior title?
[0:51:35] <+Imn0tacop> I feel like I got nerfed this year.
[0:51:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> apatLiz_RD
[0:51:54] <chronoxgp> far cry 5 is amazing with a mouse and keyboard
[0:51:55] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Remember that people place down banners at the beginning of these theings
[0:51:57] <%Deft_Thought> I use a controller to play Warframe on the PC. Like a freak.
[0:52:01] <%yourliteraldog> Pretty sure this game was built for game pad
[0:52:05] <Aydarkzero> controller for destiny is nice it's not that much of a comp game
[0:52:07] <ovan20> controller on pc? DansGame
[0:52:13] <%Jekado> i tried this game i couldn't get into it.. how is it compared to warframe?
[0:52:19] <%D33TR> @Imn0tacop Were they nice boots
[0:52:21] <thetruthofyourbeing> Fight sticks?
[0:52:21] <+necrocannibal2> real talk: controllers are comfy
[0:52:22] <JayCantDo> Is that voice the guy from the mummy?
[0:52:23] <$FrogROOT> its almost like pat has a preference or something
[0:52:26] <%valriot> You always do okay in PvP cos the matchmaking is actually pretty good at pairing equal skilled players
[0:52:40] <%Valdorick> That's accurate.
[0:52:42] <Aydarkzero> big on the consistent part
[0:52:47] <Ryan1016> Destiny actually has an endgame too
[0:52:48] <%GalacticaPhanto> @jaycantdo Oded Fehr? I think so?
[0:52:48] <%D00msDayDan> and both devs are terrible at bugfixing!
[0:52:49] <+NickyDynamite> Yeah its Oded Fehr
[0:52:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Sup dude? RE marathon tomorrow on Christmas day?
[0:52:58] <+thesw1tch> @jaycantdo no its not tom cruise
[0:53:01] <%Jekado> PC yakuza when you start up it says "Real Yakuza's use controllers"
[0:53:04] <$FrogROOT> sick flip
[0:53:07] <ovan20> destiny is pay 40 bucks for an expansion of re-used assets LUL
[0:53:10] <xshadowxx416> least fashion frame more endgame
[0:53:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bug fisting?
[0:53:29] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Bugfisting
[0:53:36] <chronoxgp> yeah everytime they come out with dlc I have to buy a new disc because it's cheaper that way for some reason
[0:53:37] <$FrogROOT> warframe is so scuffed
[0:53:39] <Ryan1016> Except telesto, telesto is always bugged
[0:53:40] <artificiallynatural> yeah, fist that bug
[0:53:40] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat have fun grinding man, almost have my first title, Wayfarer
[0:53:41] <thelonechris> Kappa
[0:53:41] <%demegodz> Hmm
[0:53:42] <$FrogROOT> no you didnt
[0:53:43] <%Harawanagangsta> do we?
[0:53:43] <+necrocannibal2> people who play Dark Souls on mouse and keyboard should be put down
[0:53:45] <%Jekado> every time i was playing warframe i was worried the game would just collapse on its self
[0:53:47] <TioXyco> do we now?
[0:53:51] <AMajorTom> Pug fisting?
[0:53:54] <+NickyDynamite> Fetish revealed
[0:53:57] <Chuckgofer> Yes, obviously you ment sexually pleasing bugs with your fist
[0:54:01] <+Imn0tacop> @D33TR Yeah. They were like a pair of boots for my job (I actually do do LEO, so they're like great boots for that). I jus kinda feel yeeted on rn cause I spent more than 1000 on them alone.
[0:54:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Fug Bisting?
[0:54:11] <%valriot> Mouse and keyboard is for typing, silly PC 4Heads
[0:54:12] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Get out the Belladonna Bitch Fist on them bugs
[0:54:13] <%CJett92> Hall wug and fist bugs?
[0:54:25] <samuel1ful> man, using Lord of Wolves in PvP makes me feel bad inside. am I a monster?
[0:54:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> apatLiz_RD apatLiz_RD apatLiz_RD
[0:54:34] <chronoxgp> if i can play fortnite with a mouse...
[0:54:45] <+Bonzosan> that dropkick is so good
[0:54:47] <Aydarkzero> @samuel1ful yes but at least you admit it so respect
[0:54:48] <%Alpha8087> What about the damn flash kick?
[0:55:04] <%D00msDayDan> the red legion would have won a long time ago if they just used more bubble psions
[0:55:05] <maebold> My only issue with destiny is it seems like if there's a bug it's pretty much not getting fixed until like the next update they do which sucks.
[0:55:15] <%DedlokPM> I like the Headbutt. teenJOY
[0:55:16] <%Double_Tap_That> It's a shame. I love the bio-mechanical of warframes, but I like the gameplay of Destiny 2 so much better.
[0:55:16] <thetruthofyourbeing> What do you think of it??
[0:55:17] <%MalekDracarus> @angriestpat how many of the ritual weapons do you have this season?
[0:55:31] <Chuckgofer> Pat what do I need to bribe you with to play elite dangerous?
[0:55:31] <%D33TR> @Imn0tacop That's fair, but you did good as their son/daughter/helicopter, plus it's kind of nice to spoil your parents sometimes
[0:55:49] <+Bonzosan> I can't believe they literally call the finisher "Flash Kick" in Destiny
[0:56:03] <djFishmonger> imo I really disliked the bio-mechanical warframes, give me the fantasy armor
[0:56:07] <+Pesuto> Aw tits, the gums where my wisdom tooth for removed started bleeding again
[0:56:07] <$FrogROOT> is it an honest to god flash kick
[0:56:11] <djFishmonger> BUT it isn't generic so that's a plus
[0:56:13] <%Jekado> is destiny 2 grindier then Warframe? because warframe can be pretty grindy
[0:56:18] <%valriot> Imagine not playing Titan
[0:56:30] <$FrogROOT> im surprised pat doesnt play titan
[0:56:30] <%yourliteraldog> Whats the best hunter subclass
[0:56:31] <maebold> imagine not having a triple jump
[0:56:43] <%Alpha8087> Yeah grinding it right now myself
[0:56:45] <%Typhaeon> Of course it has to be the week of Christmas
[0:56:52] <djFishmonger> I kinda want to reinstall D2 JUST for the iron banner.
[0:56:58] <+necrocannibal2> Warframe's movement feels and looks weird to me
[0:56:59] <%comfyman12> You see the Witcher Netflix series? I heard it was actually okay
[0:56:59] <chronoxgp> i wish i could play 1080p on console for the extra frames
[0:57:00] <%Puhff> What if I only played Destiny 1?
[0:57:01] <pmtriox> i have destiny 2 installed, and thinking about playing again makes me want to uninstall it
[0:57:03] <samuel1ful> @bonzosan well what else could you have called it? lol
[0:57:05] <+Pigg1yJuffs> I was just super disappointed that they brought back an older piece of Iron Banner armor for this Iron Banner, rather than give us a new set of armor.
[0:57:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat "Tactical" combat reconfiguration = "field stripping" ;P
[0:57:18] <ovan20> @Puhff it's the same game LUL
[0:57:22] <%yourliteraldog> Triple Jump is fun
[0:57:27] <DSD24> The moon
[0:57:28] <xshadowxx416> pl
[0:57:29] <%LaughingCatt> Haven't the been adding Destiny 1 stuff into Destiny 2?
[0:57:35] <LeftOverPizza13> it's luna
[0:57:40] <Daxalog> I wish Destiny was more Toaster friendly like Warframe
[0:57:41] <xshadowxx416> i want all old raids
[0:57:42] <chambatron> The game would be too large. Fuck the game could be like 300 Gb if they add al back
[0:57:48] <%Aeogard> Aeogard subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 4 month streak! oh chrimbus stream... merry chbgmhn patrick and family, love you dorks.
[0:57:51] <chronoxgp> destiny 1 was pretty forgettable
[0:58:01] <%valriot> Isn't Venus fuckin dead at this point?
[0:58:04] <+necrocannibal2> the game is already 100gb by itself
[0:58:08] <%yourliteraldog> I wish the hunter dodge gave I frames tho
[0:58:16] <ovan20> F
[0:58:17] <DriedLeafJuice> Having a good Christmas eve everyone?
[0:58:19] <%valriot> I thought Cabal ate Venus
[0:58:28] <$FrogROOT> waht the fuck
[0:58:30] <%Typhaeon> Fucking 81 GB of uncompressed audio? Seriously?
[0:58:32] <narusao> flac or gtfo
[0:58:33] <%Puhff> What if I'm also overwhelmed by the vast amount of "stuff" to collect and general gameplay loop? :)
[0:58:39] <DSD24> @yourliteraldog Doesn't it break aim assist?
[0:58:47] <+Pookiedaexzile> IsthisGearsofWar
[0:58:52] <+BossPlayerOG> have a good Christmas pat
[0:58:57] <%Jekado> makes sense
[0:58:57] <+Imn0tacop> @D33TR Yeah. idk. I tend to do this each year. Last year I spent close to like 3000 bucks. I figure, I make enough, and I never spend money on myself. That's just what I like to save up for -- is my family.
[0:59:00] <$FrogROOT> thats so scummy NotLikeThis

[1:00:33] <%Aeogard> @djFishmonger i thought that was halo reach
[1:00:35] <Aydarkzero> it's pretty strong
[1:00:38] <DrFacilier> wait i never seen that one is that Shadowkeep?
[1:00:43] <+necrocannibal2> @Jekado 'cause it is

[1:00:54] <Aydarkzero> bad roll
[1:00:54] <djFishmonger> @Aeogard It is also Destiny! Only in our Solar System

[1:01:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> All for naught
[1:01:08] <+Pigg1yJuffs> Chaos Reach and the Well of Radiance are the best Warlock supers. Nothing else compares. @angriestpat
[1:01:10] <%Aeogard> destiny more like... shmestiny
[1:01:12] <+HebbieJebbies> @AngriestPat I have a one-two punch AND a trench barrel from grinding today. Big fucking happy
[1:01:21] <$FrogROOT> d-ass-tiny
[1:01:21] <+HebbieJebbies> Two seperate shotguns
[1:01:25] <$FrogROOT> heheh
[1:01:25] <%valriot> Wat
[1:01:30] <+necrocannibal2> Destiny? more like Guystiny 'cause it's just for the fellas
[1:01:35] <%Jekado> wasn't there a weird Destiny 2 controversy with like loot boxes or something a while back?
[1:01:38] <%D00msDayDan> yeah it really sucks that PP can't roll grave robber, but we have threat level and one small step already
[1:01:41] <%valriot> That's pointless
[1:01:48] <+HebbieJebbies> Appended mag is dope
[1:01:51] <%Guardiansaiyan> JUST got here...is Pat fucking up?
[1:02:05] <djFishmonger> Man, keep forgetting that in-lore a Guardian cannot die unless their ghost blows up. Which never happens in-game.
[1:02:06] <$FrogROOT> @Jekado yeah. but this isnt owned by activision anymore so its good (?) now
[1:02:10] <%Aeogard> WoW absolutely killed these random loot roll stat drop items, this hurts my brain
[1:02:10] <+HebbieJebbies> Yea I haven't unlocked the extra perk yet
[1:02:31] <%Aeogard> for me, i should say
[1:02:34] <%Jekado> @FrogROOT oh right i forgot what happened i forgot its now not on bnet anymore
[1:02:34] <+HebbieJebbies> Regardless it's a fucking dope ass shotgun
[1:02:34] <+Huderga> is pat raiding?
[1:02:36] <Aydarkzero> barrel doesn't matter so much on pve shotgun
[1:02:36] <%valriot> One Small Step is a better O2P shotgun anyway
[1:02:42] <+BSplitz> this seems like the easiest title to get
[1:02:58] <djFishmonger> Is there a proper glamour system yet
[1:03:14] <+HebbieJebbies> I got lucky as fuck and got a one-two One Small Step
[1:03:17] <Aydarkzero> my god roll paradox is rifled, tactical mag, trheat detector, trench barrel with a range masterwork

[1:18:04] <%dekkitout> Not as much as Truth tajRLY
[1:18:04] <+necrocannibal2> these loading screens are fancy
[1:18:06] <thetruthofyourbeing> Damn i just beat the ff7 demo right now what a blast
[1:18:07] <%Typhaeon> I have boundless contempt for Truth in Gambit
[1:18:14] <%Alpha8087> Man Two Tailed Fox is good in the right hands
[1:18:18] <Cykron> You had us all fooled, bamboozled, and smeckledorfed
[1:18:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Man as a non-Destiny player I'm just "I know some of these words!" here
[1:18:28] <Manwad> What makes Deathbringer so good, it seems, in Gambit?
[1:18:34] <+Prelate_havok> Truth in D1 was The Truth FBtouchdown
[1:18:38] <samuel1ful> Symmetry is pretty deadly in Gambit as well
[1:18:44] <$afronooch> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson we barely understand what we're saying tbh
[1:18:45] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh wait, I forgot the emote
[1:18:55] <%Typhaeon> Get x15 charges, invade, kill everybody
[1:19:22] <Soliloquy123> Wardcliff Coil absolutely sets off people with trypophobia I hate it
[1:19:36] <%Teintstein> merry crimbus, nerds
[1:19:40] <badhaye> gross

[1:20:07] <$FrogROOT> that guy sucks
[1:20:07] <%Pigg1yJuffs> NO! Pat! Don't be Recluse PVP guy! @angriestpat
[1:20:07] <badhaye> pffft
[1:20:08] <%dekkitout> No one has 1k voices- it's a myth and so's Anarchy
[1:20:10] <Manwad> gave 'em the tickle hands
[1:20:33] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> 1K is just ok, not that Op to be honest
[1:20:35] <dungpie64> You probably would do so much better with sidearms like Last Hope its godlike rn
[1:20:49] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> there's more Jargon being thrown out in the past 20 minutes than there was League jargon in the whole podcasty
[1:20:55] <$afronooch> thats p good
[1:20:55] <xshadowxx416> pat do you want my one k voices
[1:21:00] <%dekkitout> Opening shot on a shotgun that isnt a slug shotgun?
[1:21:05] <samuel1ful> Breachlight is a great sidearm right now.
[1:21:10] <Cykron> Have a socially responsible Hanukkah
[1:21:13] <%HebbieJebbies> The other one I kept had opening shot/slideshot with a range masterwork @AngriestPat

[1:21:17] <$FrogROOT> sick
[1:21:18] <%demegodz> Wooo
[1:21:19] <%D33TR> damn
[1:21:26] <%demegodz> OHKO
[1:21:35] <maebold> I respect Saladin's more relaxed murderboner compared to Shaxx
[1:21:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE LIGHT ABANDONS—
[1:21:58] <Soliloquy123> They did a good job making all the PvP announcers encouraging
[1:22:04] <%ChaosAethr> Is Its Wrong to Laugh after someone get Shotgunned?
[1:22:12] <%D33TR> shaxx and saladin would be an ideal esports commentating duo
[1:22:17] <thetruthofyourbeing> rekt

[1:23:39] <%Pigg1yJuffs> Have you figured out how to do the Chaos Reach cancel that'll keep a pretty good amount of super energy after activation? If you pair it with Geomag Stabilizers, it can basically give you super whenever you need it. @angriestpat
[1:23:48] <dungpie64> Are people this bad on pc or are you so good right now ?
[1:23:57] <+Prinny_Raider> does this game have aim assist for controller players?

[1:40:31] <The_Whispered_One> the nerf made it stop being a pulse rifle is all

If so you should discourage her from warrior. It's the most boring class in the game. Magic knight is a much funner alternative but the stats are shit if it matters.
[1:44:00] <mayorrev> pat and paige will love him cause he does the best he can!

[1:55:11] <Glass_Muffin> @AngriestPat Hello Hope youre having an excellent day
[1:55:30] <%valriot> His actual ship is the one in the Tower, from Season 2
[1:55:33] <$FrogROOT> no :)
[1:55:37] <%dekkitout> Probably fusion rifles
[1:55:38] <Neo_Kaiser> No, Pat plays as Sheva, gives Chris the shotgun and command him to offense mode.
[1:55:42] <xshadowxx416> shotgun
[1:55:43] <%TubeMan642> shotguns
[1:55:44] <%demegodz> @AngriestPat Shotgun
[1:55:44] <%Kiiper> Scout shutgun HC Rockets
[1:55:51] <%TubeMan642> the hand cannons
[1:55:59] <ljashbrooke> Wait really @neo_kaiser
[1:56:05] <%valriot> Pat has to play as Chris for RE5 so we get the boulder punch
[1:56:21] <+ChaosVulpes> HahaCat
[1:56:38] <%yourliteraldog> Red Field Bloodline
[1:56:43] <ljashbrooke> Don’t you have to play as Chris
[1:56:45] <%demegodz> Woop
[1:56:56] <Neo_Kaiser> Yep, in RE5 the AI default mode is defense where they equip pistol/sniper and protect you. In offense they equip their strongest weapon and rush forward.
[1:57:01] <$FrogROOT> i cant believe people still put numbers in their names in place of letters
[1:57:04] <%valriot> Punch the boulder in frustration over your sisters empty womb
[1:57:08] <%juxtest> oh my god you killed that guy
[1:57:11] <%spiritofmojave> Daily reminder Wesker teleports
[1:57:25] <$FrogROOT> ??
[1:57:32] <$FrogROOT> what was their plan
[1:57:39] <%dekkitout> How does one whiff a shotgun in this game
[1:57:41] <ljashbrooke> He does teleport
[1:57:44] <%enickma11> Full on Unga Bunga
[1:57:55] <%thegreenbenis> Destiny is dumb dumb
[1:58:01] <+Rivet95> Sneeky breeky
[1:58:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Single Player RE5, you have to play as Chris. Unless its one of those special editions
[1:58:07] <studleydoorite> I can see how you wouldn't see that guy... yeah
[1:58:31] <%yourliteraldog> RE5 The Scramble for Africa
[1:58:32] <Neo_Kaiser> Single Player RE5 default allows you to play as Sheva if you want. I know, I did it.
[1:58:34] <%WhereIsWill> Update on SMT4 gang. Im 70 hours in and sided with team Walter. Destroy everything!
[1:58:52] <$FrogROOT> that
[1:59:00] <%valriot> RE5 is so weird, cos I like it then it's just randomly trash
[1:59:03] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Neo_Kaiser Not for first player thru. You unlock Sheva after completing first time
[1:59:05] <%Typhaeon> What an asshat
[1:59:06] <%Valdorick> ~!TOXIC!~
[1:59:13] <@SSaryn> the FUCK was that exchange
[1:59:21] <ljashbrooke> So pat this but even better is halo 2
[1:59:21] <%Typhaeon> Yeah let me just fly right down the lane to B, not going to get sniped or anything
[1:59:27] <studleydoorite> when the stream sniper is on your team
[1:59:33] <Neo_Kaiser> I'm pretty sure Pat has played through RE5 at least once.
[1:59:36] <$FrogROOT> you should ALWAYS clip through other people in multiplayer games
[1:59:41] <Aydarkzero> @valriot it's after you leave the village tbh
[2:00:01] <SpaceCatStation> chaos reach is always worth it
[2:00:07] <%weissguard> Et tu, Lamb Sauce?
[2:00:11] <%valriot> @aydarkzero Wait, the village or "THE VILLAGE"
[2:00:28] <Aydarkzero> @valriot THE Village
[2:00:29] <+Rivet95> What power lets you make the enemies dive face first into your bullets?
[2:00:30] <ljashbrooke> After the village and it starts to get super dumb is when I love it even more though but I like 6 because of how dumb it is
[2:00:33] <%Valdorick> You go from scary village elder monster man to "I'm neopleon" and then "I'm a cultist but also here's the merc guys"
[2:00:36] <SpaceCatStation> PogChamp
[2:00:56] <%dekkitout> Is there some sort of gas leak in Pat's matchmaking bracket...
[2:00:56] <%Chichen> Chichen subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months, currently on a 14 month streak! I hope you, Paige, and Elmo all have a nice Christmas! Do you ever think about the fact that you and Paige's streams would be banned in China due to the SKELETON? (and totally not the other reasons. ignore those)
[2:00:59] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should do his playthrough of RE4 on Pro with no merchant
[2:01:02] <%TubeMan642> You're making lord Salad Man proud Pat

[2:08:00] <Neo_Kaiser> I can't believe Pats dead.
[2:08:01] <critfumble_> JJ Abrams got to him after all the mad shit he talked on the podcast

[2:08:41] <Neo_Kaiser> Paige should finish the RE marathon so that we can laugh at her jumping to jumpscares.
[2:08:42] <+ozzrabbit> @Pigg1yJuffs I have no problem. all you have to do is hold down the trigger. How old is your controller?
[2:08:56] <artificiallynatural> I can't believe Pat died pissing his pants
[2:08:57] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Pigg1yJuffs No? I switch between Xbone, DS, and KBM constantly (im weird like that). Never had that issue with my DS controller

[2:11:42] <%wannabemoogle> He rage
[2:11:45] <%SoFarFetched> You're actually not supposed to really wash cats anyway,only time is if you REALLY have to cause things happened.
[2:11:46] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> assert your dominance

[2:12:26] <%ryome> Why not just let him into the toilet?
[2:12:33] <artificiallynatural> wouldn't a scratch post or something be better than clipping?

[2:33:24] <$FrogROOT> this gun is fucking dumb
[2:33:35] <$FrogROOT> theres alot of dumb bullshit in this game
[2:33:39] <$FrogROOT> and i kinda dig
[2:33:52] <%dekkitout> 13-15 meters is Map-erone range
[2:33:52] <+ZephynM> That shotgun looks cool
[2:34:05] <%Josef_Stryker> Shotguns are always the most satisfying gun to fire in games for me.
[2:34:08] <+DACH33ZMAN> oh god the quest line requires sg kills? I thought mind benders ambition was a problem before....

[2:34:51] <muetank> apatGib the roll gods say no
[2:34:53] <+ZephynM> @Soulbishop I bought it because it looked interesting. Though when I play the older RE games, I don't expect a super serious experience.
[2:35:07] <%demegodz> RNGesus says no good roll for you
[2:35:08] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> HahaHide tolovePadoru apatDab
[2:35:12] <+ZephynM> @Soulbishop I like how in chapter 2, when Chris fell down and hurt his leg, he had the most "meh" toned "Shit!" resposne.
[2:35:19] <%demegodz> He was too good for you last season
[2:35:19] <+DACH33ZMAN> you got this
[2:35:27] <Soulbishop> Soon PC will have RE 3 and the collection will be whole with no emulators. MAKE US WHOLE.

[2:35:43] <%demegodz> Zone time
[2:35:46] <%Typhaeon> It's a Crazy Talk Christmas miracle
[2:35:47] <Neo_Kaiser> I hope Resident Evil Gaiden gets a remake
[2:35:50] <%demegodz> Handcannon
[2:35:56] <Finakala> @Soulbishop RE Gaiden is on PC?
[2:35:57] <%demegodz> Pew pew
[2:36:03] <+ZephynM> I'm definitely gong to pre-order it. The classic outfit for Jill looks hot.
[2:36:12] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> "Not this time" "It's false" "We made it up" "This one was invented by a writer"
[2:36:14] <Soulbishop> That is not a mainline my good person @Finakala
[2:36:19] <+Thesh3p3rd> Pat I got p3 fes and p4 for Christmas now all my friends are calling me a weeb
[2:36:19] <+DACH33ZMAN> top fragged too? god damn
[2:36:32] <%demegodz> Jesus @AngriestPat Did your back hurt after that match?
[2:36:36] <%dekkitout> Diet Red Death <3
[2:36:37] <+ZephynM> I would like a remake of RE4 tbh. That one was my favorite.
[2:36:43] <$FrogROOT> @Thesh3p3rd what a weeb you are
[2:36:44] <%demegodz> 21 kills with 12 below you
[2:36:47] <+ZephynM> And it all started with RE7 for me when I decided to grow a pair with survival horror
[2:36:48] <%demegodz> Christ
[2:36:54] <+ZephynM> Now RE doesn't scare me at all since RE7 LUL
[2:36:55] <Finakala> @Thesh3p3rd Enjoy them, those games are better than your friends
[2:36:56] <Soulbishop> But if they made the light gun RE on the boat I would get that again
[2:36:57] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> khadDokoda
[2:37:06] <+Thesh3p3rd> @frogroot I mean ya
[2:37:10] <Ryan1016> 15 WHOLE kills
[2:37:12] <%Alpha8087> TIME FOR GUN
[2:37:13] <%demegodz> It's impossible
[2:37:22] <+DACH33ZMAN> now dont be a loser and get 14 this game
[2:37:23] <$FrogROOT> he cant do it forsenKek
[2:37:25] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Just you wait for the next step
[2:37:25] <%Rngiddion> only a pro gamer could do that
[2:37:32] <+Thesh3p3rd> @finakala I intend to
[2:37:36] <%Alpha8087> Oh shit is that Crimson
[2:37:37] <+Toxic_CIzzle> it's okay you have a beetleborg on your team
[2:37:44] <Nekros4442> does that say 24 bullets in a revolver?
[2:37:44] <Finakala> Maybe if they made Gaiden for PC I could actually finish it without my game crashing and corrupting my game in the same spot multiple times
[2:37:53] <%Alpha8087> Crimson is my JAM
[2:37:57] <%WhereIsWill> that gun is beautiful Kreygasm
[2:38:04] <%demegodz> This gun fucks
[2:38:12] <+Aesopska> that's no revolver
[2:38:18] <Soulbishop> Who wants to bet pat will secretly like RE Resistance Or Evil by Resident as I like to call it.
[2:38:20] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pretty gun
[2:38:21] <+DACH33ZMAN> it also fucks
[2:38:22] <$FrogROOT> nice
[2:38:23] <%spiritofmojave> why's this gun studded
[2:38:33] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @AngriestPat engravings provide no tactical advantage whatsoever
[2:38:33] <+DACH33ZMAN> do you have the catalyst?
[2:38:33] <Daxalog> seems busted
[2:38:35] <%Alpha8087> I love it for the Sundail

[2:38:50] <%mayorrev> Whats it called again?
[2:38:52] <%Typhaeon> First exotic I got, still the best
[2:38:54] <$FrogROOT> theres alot of busted stuff in this game
[2:38:59] <+DACH33ZMAN> the catalyst is delicious for this gun
[2:39:02] <%dekkitout> Crimson is the baseline for how elaborate Destiny 2 exotics are

[2:46:54] <uncledoodsauce> ja rule knows all because false advertisement
[2:46:54] <%nofestu2> Pat is turning into Paige

[2:59:27] <Finakala> This makes me think a bit of one of the maps in 2016 DOOM MP

[3:14:04] <mankeyfigh> How did Pat get bodied there?
[3:14:06] <Soulbishop> You know that whole yule log thing with that one channel on tv that has a burning fireplace.?
[3:14:07] <Aydarkzero> Melee ranges made sense back then and Bungie forgot that Warlocks had the range melee
[3:14:16] <%demegodz> Dick hair away from next level
[3:14:27] <+Bob_Tom> is this PC destiny on a controller?
[3:14:31] <Aydarkzero> and now that every melee is the same range (for the most part) Warlocks just get cucked in Melee speed
[3:14:33] <%mistermastergreg> @mankeyfigh why did you call me stupid?

[3:16:14] <TheChillRoom> You can shoot the purple ball?!
[3:16:18] <%demegodz> @Bob_Tom There's a bounty that pat needs to get Rocket Launcher kills and when you pickup power ammo it only gives you one shot
[3:16:21] <%demegodz> 10 kills
[3:16:21] <+ozzrabbit> do you have fallout on your mind pat?
[3:16:22] <+DACH33ZMAN> it breaks it faster

[3:17:23] <Aydarkzero> @mankeyfigh the more points you control the more points you get for kills

[3:17:30] <%WhereIsWill> melee looks real satisfying in this game
[3:17:42] <%DedlokPM> @mankeyfigh kill count but cap adavantage gives more points per kill
[3:17:48] <+DACH33ZMAN> @WhereIsWill its not if you play warlock lol
[3:17:51] <Cykron> @whereiswill It is
[3:18:03] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat How's your ISP been since you switched providers? Any issues?
[3:18:08] <Aydarkzero> Melee registration is the worst
[3:18:12] <+DACH33ZMAN> GOGOGOOGOG
[3:18:16] <+DACH33ZMAN> GET A KILLLL
[3:18:23] <+DACH33ZMAN> hell yeah
[3:18:25] <TheChillRoom> @WhereIsWill Melees feel real good. Hunter melee feels even better with certain passive combinations
[3:18:28] <Soulbishop> @WhereIsWill they added that melee style of kill there used to be only on plain rifle stroke or pistol whip
[3:18:32] <Aydarkzero> BIG PLAYS
[3:18:40] <nobknee> Pat's currently my second biggest stream boy, behind only Bob Ross. Hard to beat the perm.

[3:20:50] <+Bob_Tom> @AngriestPat favorite raid?
[3:20:56] <%dekkitout> It can roll triple tap/vorpal if you need a void boss killer
[3:20:57] <Tucker0603> it's 50 zoom
[3:21:02] <Aydarkzero> if you want a short scope you need revoker

[3:22:45] <%araechfgc> D1 map?
[3:22:45] <Aydarkzero> @dach33zman good to know i need sniper kills for my Revoker quest
[3:22:47] <%WhereIsWill> gottem
[3:22:58] <+MachigattaLT> did they delete OEM yet ive been out of the game a few months
[3:23:01] <derap41> kill steals
[3:23:03] <Cykron> Noice
[3:23:03] <Aydarkzero> @megaryanx yep
[3:23:06] <TheChillRoom> Look at you, casually picking up these kills
[3:23:08] <+DACH33ZMAN> @Aydarkzero if you have a good tartaras gaze that works too
[3:23:15] <mankeyfigh> Yeah also feels like he lone wolfs it a bit too much. Eh hindsight is 20/20
[3:23:25] <%dekkitout> OEM no longer gives overshield, iirc- cause sure... that was the problem...
[3:23:25] <Aydarkzero> @MachigattaLT still in the game and still tracks you for engaing
[3:23:31] <+konekoryugamine> It's not the worst, but it's not the best
[3:23:36] <+Bob_Tom> its compact with a lot of dimensions
[3:23:38] <+konekoryugamine> Like a backrub from your grandma
[3:23:43] <Aydarkzero> the shields werent the problem Bungo LUL
[3:23:43] <randomness_yo> Isnt this a Destiny 1 map?
[3:23:52] <+MachigattaLT> good to know that dogshit will never die /s

[3:24:02] <+DACH33ZMAN> the fact you get walls AND increased damage is busted
[3:24:05] <Cykron> @randomness_yo Yes
[3:24:07] <+konekoryugamine> BOB ROSS' LEFT TESTICLE?!
[3:24:16] <%DedlokPM> @MachigattaLT they removed the overshield aspect, but still has damage buff and marking
[3:24:26] <+MachigattaLT> imagine having the audacity to shoot someone in a fps
[3:24:28] <%dekkitout> That hunter's a hero
[3:24:32] <%demegodz> RUN YOU FOOl
[3:24:33] <%ButterMyBrisket> LUL
[3:24:34] <+DACH33ZMAN> hunter just tanked so much damage for you there lol
[3:24:34] <%demegodz> Nice
[3:24:37] <+konekoryugamine> WHO NAMES THEMSELF
[3:24:39] <%TubeMan642> Rusted Lands is a good map if you are sick in the head
[3:24:43] <+MachigattaLT> i wouldnt be as salty if it were taget farmable and you could just meta whore against meta whores
[3:24:44] <+Hafpret> this looks more call of duty than call of duty

[3:25:36] <%TubeMan642> They should bring back Anomoly

[3:25:52] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> olay~
[3:26:01] <+DACH33ZMAN> my god you dont even need the rift
[3:26:02] <TwentyCXII> Titans DansGame
[3:26:06] <+konekoryugamine> What rift
[3:26:06] <Aydarkzero> @TubeMan642 surprised it wasn't brought back giving how we went to the moon
[3:26:09] <%WhereIsWill> titans seem like the chad class LUL
[3:26:09] <%araechfgc> tf is a throwing knife
[3:26:19] <+konekoryugamine> if titans are chads then what is erin
[3:26:26] <Tucker0603> as a Titan I can confirm
[3:26:27] <Aydarkzero> Hunters
[3:26:28] <%dekkitout> Titans are pretty Chad when they're not eating crayons
[3:26:29] <+Bob_Tom> @megaryanx a gun :^)
[3:26:33] <%DedlokPM> @megaryanx a knife made for throwing. apatWhat

[3:26:48] <Aydarkzero> oof
[3:26:48] <%demegodz> LUL
[3:26:52] <+DACH33ZMAN> use the rift with the sniper pat
[3:26:53] <+MachigattaLT> @TheChillRoom are there oneshot handcannons? i dont play the weapon class because i never liked how handcannons' specific blooming
[3:26:55] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[3:26:55] <+puffinup> f
[3:26:56] <TheChillRoom> WRONG RIFT MingLee
[3:26:56] <+konekoryugamine> That's a party foul
[3:27:12] <+konekoryugamine> YOu just got killed by the Demon Queen

[3:27:15] <+puffinup> b i g f l i n c h
[3:27:19] <%demegodz> Same guy?
[3:27:25] <%TubeMan642> @Aydarkzero Surprised there aren't any moon maps for pvp
[3:27:27] <+konekoryugamine> Who are you? Rick Sanchez?
[3:27:33] <jonnyworldbeater> Hello stream. Happy holidays.
[3:27:37] <%demegodz> YOOO
[3:27:39] <%dekkitout> @MachigattaLT There are some ways you can 1 shot with the slower handcannons, but it's too much of a gimmick to invest in
[3:27:40] <TheChillRoom> @MachigattaLT Eriana's Vow is 1 to 2 shots depending on the game mode. You're going to one shot anyone who's even been tickled. Makes it a good pairing for assault rifles
[3:27:41] <+puffinup> DANG
[3:27:43] <+konekoryugamine> OH GOD I COUGHED and it FUCKING HURT SO BAD
[3:27:44] <+DACH33ZMAN> RIFT
[3:27:49] <%demegodz> Bro
[3:27:51] <Aydarkzero> @TubeMan642 to be fair that one moon map with the doors wasn't that great
[3:27:56] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat a good perk roll on the trophy Hunter is snapshot sights and lead from gold
[3:27:57] <+Cavumentum> Slapped
[3:28:05] <+MachigattaLT> that was my thought, i usually get a chance to fireback vs handcannon users
[3:28:08] <mankeyfigh> Holy shit I was today years old when I remembered Rick’s last name is Sanchez
[3:28:17] <Jrocy247> Merry Christmas Chat and Pat

[3:29:18] <TwentyCXII> Pat looks to be doing pretty well to me. He's winning fights against people that shoot first
[3:29:18] <TheChillRoom> That sniper looks like it would pair well with the Hunter reload dodge and unflinching aim mod
[3:29:28] <%demegodz> Alright, shifts done, time to head home
[3:29:29] <Jrocy247> Will Pat get toxic at multiplayer FPS game?

[3:32:19] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is an e1it3 gamer

[3:32:20] <+MachigattaLT> its what reddit is for
[3:32:27] <%dekkitout> It's been bad since hunters had to get void kills back in D1
[3:32:28] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat night Pat, good luck with the iron banana quest
[3:32:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> its never been easier to rank up in comp

[3:34:45] <%dekkitout> See if you have a fast zoom, rare quality sniper in collections
[3:34:46] <+DACH33ZMAN> the scout rifle flinch is unbeatable
[3:34:47] <%DedlokPM> Equip unlflinching sniper rifle
[3:34:49] <+Bob_Tom> @Beough new season's sniper
[3:34:49] <Aydarkzero> @Beough Trophy Hunter from season pass
[3:34:53] <%Typhaeon> I'd like to try Box Breathing on that
[3:34:54] <TheChillRoom> Prefire, or dodge and retaliate. Or get Unflinching SR
[3:34:54] <Jrocy247> @Aydarkzero Sounds like he's trying to be Snake but not really
[3:34:55] <chronoxgp> jus use the auto pat, scopes are for secondary ammo
[3:34:58] <+puffinup> put all the unflinching rifle mods from the uhh

[3:35:08] <Aydarkzero> @Jrocy247 he's actuall Reaper from Overwatch
[3:35:24] <+MachigattaLT> does scout rifle have comparable target ac to sniper?
[3:35:29] <%DedlokPM> It has regular mod too. Think it is arm or chest. Not sure of element
[3:35:48] <Jrocy247> @Aydarkzero Ah, now that makes sense
[3:35:50] <+puffinup> does pat have a vendetta against the seasonal mods o:
[3:35:53] <TheChillRoom> @DedlokPM It can be equipped to either, if memory serves
[3:35:53] <+DACH33ZMAN> sniper rifle unflinching aim is a void body armor mod @AngriestPat
[3:36:02] <chronoxgp> i love the pulse and scout but they just aren't good for multiplayer comp
[3:36:03] <%Zulrez> Kappa300 yeah pat is the best. he will never give up in the face of adversity, will never let go of victory, he'd never turn around and desert his team mates. he'd never make us cry, and he always says goodbye before end of stream, he'd totally never lie and hurts us.

[3:37:54] <FirewallStorm> trophy hunter is the second best running pve weapon
[3:38:22] <Neo_Kaiser> The controls in FF7R kinda bug me.
[3:38:41] <%smugjorgen98> @Neo_Kaiser what way
[3:38:52] <Aydarkzero> i'm guessing the ff7r demo is out in the japanese store?
[3:38:52] <mankeyfigh> Eh I’m for the new controls
[3:38:58] <FirewallStorm> vorpal weapon @AngriestPat
[3:39:03] <+DACH33ZMAN> snapshot + any other roll
[3:39:11] <$FrogROOT> its just a listing dude
[3:39:15] <$FrogROOT> not actually out
[3:39:20] <@SSaryn> IT'S A LISTING YOU BASTARDS
[3:39:25] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:39:28] <Jrocy247> So is that FF7 Demo stuff real or not?
[3:39:30] <%dekkitout> Based on the light gg site, snapshot is all you need
[3:39:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> Final Fantasy VII Demo was just listed on the PSN store. [ ALL regions listed, cannot be played yet and this is an offical leak from Japan concerning the Demo ] I will post link in Reddit
[3:39:34] <$FrogROOT> it seems to be real
[3:39:57] <TheChillRoom> I really need to figure out a build I like for Warlock. I've been trying for literally all 150 hours I've been playing the game. Do I just not like Warlock?
[3:39:58] <KingsVisage> @AngriestPat The PvE roll for Trophy Hunter is Vorpal Weapon + Triple Tap + a magazine perk in the second column
[3:40:02] <%weissguard> Bob Ross' Left Testi LUL
[3:40:05] <%CopperTucker> aw yes games with the boyfriend. Also goddamn I keep thinking I'm the Tucker being talked to.
[3:40:08] <Neo_Kaiser> I also wish they toned down on the super charged graphics and had effects make more of an impact.
[3:40:21] <Aydarkzero> snapshot is on the same tree as vorpal
[3:40:24] <mankeyfigh> God is the game comes out in March do I even care about a demo?
[3:40:27] <%ButterMyBrisket> night pat and chat. merry cbristmas
[3:40:34] <mankeyfigh> It’s sooo close
[3:40:38] <KingsVisage> @AngriestPat Trophy Hunter isn't great for PvP because of that fat zoom, but yeah snapshot is what you want if you wanna use it for PvP
[3:40:38] <Jrocy247> Man, releasing that FF7 Demo would probably be the worst Idea, people will Datamine and glitch the hell out of the game.
[3:40:42] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should download FF7R demo right now and play it
[3:40:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> @TheChillRoom locks are not fun this season. ive been a lock my whole destiny career and we are only good for middle tree dawnblade
[3:40:45] <+SolverCODO> My dad works for nintendo and got me FF7 early
[3:40:47] <%DedlokPM> @AngriestPat Unflinching Sniper is a Void Chest Armor mod

[3:41:28] <mankeyfigh> Dammit @neo_kaiser it’s just a listing bro
[3:41:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> Go to Reddit and the sub reddit, sort by new and you should see the post which will direct you to the tweet and original post about FFVII Remake
[3:41:47] <%Guardiansaiyan> on the sub reddit
[3:41:51] <%smugjorgen98> @Jrocy247 I hope they glitch the shit out of it
[3:41:55] <+SolverCODO> Have you ever smoked?
[3:41:56] <+puffinup> can anyone explain the deal with pat not wantin to use the uh, seasonal artifact mods?
[3:41:58] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat should download the demo right now and have everybody watch.
[3:42:04] <Aydarkzero> i dunno trophy hunter doesn't seem that great for me
[3:42:07] <TheChillRoom> @dach33zman That explains why I'm having so much more fun being a shitlord with my Combination blow and Shinobu's Vow Skip Grenades Hunter
[3:42:12] <+xenoriddley36> You know, I tried to play Destiny 2 since it's free on Steam. Had no idea what's going on and was so confused about everything that I uninstalled it
[3:42:12] <$FrogROOT> it be like that
[3:42:12] <xeros720> you smoke the one weed and he was never the same again
[3:42:14] <+UnderageBat> yeah that sounds like Crucible alright
[3:42:15] <%dekkitout> Your elo might be putting you in the deep end, yeah
[3:42:15] <Aydarkzero> it happens every time @AngriestPat
[3:42:17] <%DedlokPM> @puffinup Mind goblins? apatGoblin
[3:42:23] <+puffinup> :P
[3:42:24] <+DACH33ZMAN> @AngriestPat i suggest grinding for a really good tataras gaze for the juicy 72 rpm one shot kill sniper
[3:42:30] <$FrogROOT> theyll bump you back down soon
[3:42:32] <mankeyfigh> Lies
[3:42:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Neo_Kaiser the demo isn't available yet, I think next week
[3:42:43] <Soliloquy123> Friendly teabagging is the best
[3:42:50] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat needs to get to Master rank in Overwatch.
[3:43:04] <xeros720> honestly, i just think it's too late at night
[3:43:13] <+DACH33ZMAN> @TheChillRoom my friend says playing top tree dawnblade is fun with wing of sacred dawn but i cant do well with it in pvp. hunters and titans have way cooler classes and builds rn
[3:43:14] <%Alpha8087> Keep the big aggressive, Pat!
[3:43:14] <$onlypuppet> Weed? Like marijuana?
[3:43:17] <xeros720> at a certain point, everyone more casual goes to sleep
[3:43:20] <Zebroneath> F
[3:43:21] <+puffinup> OOF
[3:43:22] <Aydarkzero> welp
[3:43:24] <%WhereIsWill> F
[3:43:27] <+Bob_Tom> lmao nice
[3:43:27] <Fullmeatalvapire> and still better than me
[3:43:27] <+xenoriddley36> F
[3:43:30] <%Guardiansaiyan> sbeefDead
[3:43:34] <mankeyfigh> F
[3:43:35] <+TruKiryu> That's a "BRUH" moment.
[3:43:38] <mesamus> it's my first time seeing the destiny 2 pvp, did the announcer always sound like the For Honor one?
[3:43:49] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> And this is why you NEVER sit on heavy on this map
[3:43:56] <+DACH33ZMAN> @mesamus hes the VA for reaper in ow lol
[3:44:00] <+puffinup> @mesamus it's an event announcer
[3:44:01] <TheChillRoom> @dach33zman Yeah, the only really satisfying thing I've found to do with Warlock has been top tree Dawnblade with as much Super cooldown reduction as I can scrape out
[3:44:02] <$onlypuppet> What D:
[3:44:04] <KingsVisage> @AngriestPat Switching to a Healing Rift would help with holding an area down
[3:44:06] <+xenoriddley36> F Word
[3:44:18] <Neo_Kaiser> Pat's having heated gamer moments.
[3:44:23] <%DedlokPM> @mesamus no. This is the announcer for the special Iron Banner mode that pops up every now and then for a week
[3:44:25] <Aydarkzero> this map could go
[3:44:37] <Daxalog> Go where?
[3:44:41] <Aydarkzero> the trash
[3:44:42] <TheChillRoom> That melee was pretty clean tbh
[3:44:44] <$onlypuppet> Which F word?
[3:44:44] <+xenoriddley36> So is Pat now becoming an MLG?
[3:44:50] <%Zulrez> to the store for smokes and never come back
[3:44:57] <+xenoriddley36> @onlypuppet You know the one
[3:45:01] <%DedlokPM> Crucible, which is the regular pvp mode, has a different announcer
[3:45:02] <+Remery_> Remery_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 36 months! 
[3:45:07] <TheChillRoom> Does Destiny 2 have any kind of esports scene?
[3:45:12] <tetrabrick1lt> Happy Easter everybody
[3:45:15] <TheChillRoom> Even if it's just on Go4?
[3:45:15] <$onlypuppet> The pay respect one?
[3:45:16] <Aydarkzero> @TheChillRoom nope
[3:45:29] <xshadowxx416> yes
[3:45:29] <+xenoriddley36> No, the bad F Word
[3:45:37] <$FrogROOT> is that the last thing you need to do
[3:45:45] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:45:46] <betrayed_llama> @thechillroom Destiny 2 is way too unbalanced to have any competitive scene
[3:45:51] <$FrogROOT> triKEK
[3:45:54] <+Cavumentum> Watch! You can pinpoint the moment his heart rips in half!
[3:45:56] <TheChillRoom> @Aydarkzero I had a feeling. It really should. I'd watch the fuck out of G2 and NaVi going at it with this game
[3:45:57] <%thegreenbenis> Yeet
[3:45:57] <$onlypuppet> Is it fuck??
[3:46:00] <+DACH33ZMAN> i tried to during y1 days when rolls were stratic
[3:46:01] <%WhereIsWill> no fun for you pat
[3:46:05] <+xenoriddley36> whats he even trying to do?
[3:46:11] <tetrabrick1lt> LUL
[3:46:12] <TheChillRoom> @betrayed_llama Yeah, you're probably right.
[3:46:14] <$FrogROOT> throw a bunch of games and get matched with losers again
[3:46:18] <+DACH33ZMAN> but a comp scene in the current meta would be a nightmare
[3:46:40] <+xenoriddley36> Ah, thanks for the explanation @AngriestPat
[3:46:46] <%DedlokPM> And that purple box is the only source of power ammo on this map
[3:46:48] <tetrabrick1lt> is there any Rumble mode with a lot of heavy?
[3:46:48] <+DACH33ZMAN> queue up with a 6 stack and camp heavy with them the whole game lol
[3:46:56] <TheChillRoom> @dach33zman But would it be worse than Pokemon before this gen making breeding a breeze?
[3:47:03] <%smugjorgen98> oat are you playing this on stadia?
[3:47:04] <Finakala> Big spins
[3:47:06] <+DarkOnyx7> LUL
[3:47:07] <%AncelDeLambert> well, that, and they kill you every time YOU get the drop
[3:47:07] <nikoloas_> LUL
[3:47:25] <%DedlokPM> @smugjorgen98 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA No. sbfpPat
[3:47:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "frustating"
[3:47:27] <%dekkitout> @TheChillRoom The comp scene was okay with just hacking in perfect pokemon
[3:47:29] <+xenoriddley36> Well, S Word
[3:47:35] <%dekkitout> Or they played showdown
[3:47:38] <+puffinup> @TheChillRoom in pokemon, knowledge is everything. here it there's waaaay too many variables for consistency
[3:47:39] <%AncelDeLambert> gotta love the broken platforming
[3:47:45] <$FrogROOT> FGET IT
[3:47:48] <$FrogROOT> yeah
[3:47:56] <$FrogROOT> does he keep it
[3:47:56] <+DACH33ZMAN> @TheChillRoom i have 0 clue what the comp pokemon scene is like but i imagine there are salty people out there about EV and IV rng
[3:47:59] <tetrabrick1lt> OH NO
[3:47:59] <$FrogROOT> oh no
[3:48:00] <%WhereIsWill> lets goo apatDab sbfpYeyeye apatDab sbfpYeyeye
[3:48:04] <mankeyfigh> Sooo instead of focusing on the game, Pat is fishing for the weapon specific kills he needs?
[3:48:11] <%DedlokPM> @FrogROOT he got the rocket kill
[3:48:16] <$FrogROOT> OH
[3:48:20] <$FrogROOT> didnt see lol
[3:48:26] <+xenoriddley36> @puffinup I'm of the offense only variety in Pokemon. The only Stat I care about decreasing is the HP stat. All other moves are worthless
[3:48:32] <%smugjorgen98> @DedlokPM he should... for our entertainment
[3:48:38] <TheChillRoom> @dekkitout True. I didn't beyond decently high showdown, but this year now that I don't necessarily have to deal with PKHex, I might see about VGC
[3:48:40] <$FrogROOT> he needs to kill with the rocket launcher for the challenge thing or whatever @mankeyfigh
[3:49:02] <$FrogROOT> engram triPog
[3:49:08] <%DedlokPM> @FrogROOT harder to realize with the type of rocket launcher he has as it is not what you would consider convential
[3:49:21] <$FrogROOT> true true
[3:49:33] <%dekkitout> Now seems like a good phase for vgc, since we won't be seeing shit like primal kyogre for a strong while
[3:49:34] <TheChillRoom> Oh right, Pat's using the micro rocket spray
[3:49:34] <+puffinup> @xenoriddley36 have fun getting destroyed by the corferropex core lmao
[3:49:40] <+DACH33ZMAN> CAMP
[3:49:51] <+DACH33ZMAN> PepeHands
[3:49:53] <Jrocy247> YO THAT WAS HILARIOUS
[3:49:54] <mesamus> one of my friend keeps telling me and my halo group he wants us to play destiny 2 together, is there any particular class and build you recommend? note that we play all halo games from mcc and 5 so dunno what would help us adapt or get the hang of it
[3:49:56] <+xenoriddley36> I have no idea what that is. I don't play competetive pokemon.
[3:50:02] <Jrocy247> He did a backflip as he died
[3:50:06] <%dekkitout> Welcome to the real Destiyn pvp LUL
[3:50:16] <xshadowxx416> just finsh it now to do my hunter
[3:50:23] <%Chichen> HahaNutcracker
[3:50:33] <+xenoriddley36> @puffinup actually, the last pokemon I played was Sun/Moon and before that it was Ruby/Sapphire
[3:50:38] <+DACH33ZMAN> lowkey not bad perks
[3:50:39] <+UnderageBat> Just play whatever class you like the most
[3:50:42] <+puffinup> YO
[3:50:44] <+UnderageBat> have fun with it
[3:50:45] <xshadowxx416> thats good
[3:50:47] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Destiny has gorgeous UI
[3:50:52] <%dekkitout> It can body with a full swash stack
[3:51:07] <TheChillRoom> @xenoriddley36 VGC is the official format for the game's sanctioned tournaments. It's different from a lot of Showdown in that it's 2v2 rather than 1v1 battles
[3:51:10] <+DACH33ZMAN> too bad theres no range perks but quickdraw with swash is really interesting
[3:51:48] <RetributionP> destiny for Christmas? my whole Christmas is ruined. Kappa
[3:51:53] <+xenoriddley36> Well, I don't play online pokemon. Only play for the story mode when I do. I suck at competetive anything
[3:52:24] <TheChillRoom> That's fair. Competitive Pokemon battling really is a whole othe game tbh
[3:52:29] <%dekkitout> So long as you can get over the breeding grind, pokemon comp is pretty easy to learn
[3:52:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> @mesamus it depends on what play style you like. If you like to hold W and slay out close quarters play titan. If you like to be quick and cunning then play hunter. if you enjoy inflicting pain upon yourself play warlock
[3:52:54] <+xenoriddley36> I just don't have the patience for it. My backlog is already so massive that it's just not realistic for me
[3:52:56] <Oxybe> competitive pokemon is like playing paper scissors rock only sometimes paper throws scissors. or bugs.
[3:53:11] <%Jolnir> 1990 was 30 years ago
[3:53:17] <KingsVisage> Fun fact, if you get a melee kill with a swashbuckler slug shotgun, it gives you x5 swashbuckler stacks which makes it a 1-shot body shot
[3:53:17] <+xenoriddley36> Hell, I'm just now getting to River City Girls. Had that since LRG released it and haven't played it till today
[3:53:27] <pswayde> Bruh, no shaders on your gear?
[3:53:30] <%dekkitout> And then you throw rock, and you find out that you're up against a rain stall team
[3:53:35] <RetributionP> Pat does a thing while chat talks about pokemon
[3:53:38] <TheChillRoom> Oh wow. Yeah, your backlog is too big to add an esport to your plate
[3:53:52] <SilverJakler> Exit Strategy is a good name for a gun
[3:53:57] <+xenoriddley36> I'm actually stuck on the Hibari fight right now LUL
[3:53:58] <Oxybe> which is bullshit, because nothing beats good ol rock!
[3:54:09] <mankeyfigh> eXit
[3:54:27] <tetrabrick1lt> BIG SHIPS
[3:54:29] <+xenoriddley36> Had Ace Combat 7 since it release and still haven't touched it either. Just Finished Zanki Zero - Last Beginning today
[3:54:39] <TheHeroAppears> first comes rock
[3:54:56] <+xenoriddley36> and that's not even considering the anime backlog I've got
[3:54:57] <%nofestu2> It's his element
[3:55:06] <%smugjorgen98> guys ff14 Q: is there any point leveling other classess before leveling your main class to max level
[3:55:14] <+ozzrabbit> Just use the Revoker
[3:55:14] <+killer_squid1990> Pog
[3:55:16] <%dekkitout> Thats a good one
[3:55:22] <studleydoorite> The Supremacy is such a sniper rifle name
[3:55:47] <mankeyfigh> Come at me as if you were trying to kill me
[3:55:50] <+xenoriddley36> Restarted One Piece cause a friend wanted to watch it, but didn't want to start it himself. I was all done with Whole Cake Island when I started over, and were on Water 7 Now.
[3:56:02] <+DACH33ZMAN> save Eris from her spooky ghosts!
[3:56:04] <%D33TR> @smugjorgen98 There used to be when cross class skills were learnt by gaining them from other classes. But now all classes just have access to that pool once appropriate level, so no real reason besides just wanting to change it up
[3:56:05] <%dekkitout> There was a sniper called 'Patience and Time' that gave you radar and invisibility in Destiny 1, now that was a sniper
[3:56:11] <Psyramics> level other classes if you think you'll like them more, or if the class you want has a mind level ee1uirement
[3:56:26] <Psyramics> requirement
[3:56:31] <Jrocy247> "Opponent has claimed dat ass"
[3:56:34] <mankeyfigh> @xenoriddley36 oh god the one piece anime are you sure may should i send help

[3:57:37] <%Chichen> don't worry, we never thought that.

[3:57:43] <chicken_danger> Pat we love you because you're not cool
[3:57:43] <Zebroneath> When did that happen?
[3:57:44] <SilverJakler> they are exposed
[3:57:48] <%WhereIsWill> pats coolness was all an illusion!
[3:57:52] <$Smolkupo> We never think you're cool Pat LUL
[3:57:53] <%DedlokPM> When did that happen? rooThink
[3:57:53] <%smugjorgen98> i must have skipd that part of the stream
[3:57:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> We never thought you were cool.
[3:57:55] <SilverJakler> out in the open for all to see
[3:57:57] <%DakotaMacDoodle> do not worry we never thought you were cool
[3:58:01] <%nofestu2> *Insert obvious joke here*
[3:58:03] <mankeyfigh> I just read the manga and watch the anime fights, pro strats only over here
[3:58:03] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:58:06] <+DACH33ZMAN> i really should change my name to dacheezman like every other platform i use
[3:58:10] <Jrocy247> @AngriestPat If it makes you feel any better, at least we laugh at you for thinking you're cool.
[3:58:11] <%araechfgc> to quote Char... "I came to laugh at you"
[3:58:14] <xshadowxx416> pat we never thought you were cool apatCanada apatCanada
[3:58:16] <RetributionP> I watched the shit out of those pne peice episodes and an on current atm

[3:58:42] <+DACH33ZMAN> yikes
[3:58:42] <+ozzrabbit> O.O ... I just got a Trophy Hunter with Extended Mag, Lead From Gold, and Vorpal Weapon. HOLY SHIT!
[3:58:42] <Ryan1016> LUL
[3:58:46] <Jrocy247> That's a weird fucking gun
[3:58:47] <$Smolkupo> LMAOOOOO
[3:58:49] <%dekkitout> @mankeyfigh Damn, those are the pro strats, and I'm wasting time watching Fire Force given my place in the manga
[3:58:49] <+xenoriddley36> @mankeyfigh Well, we usually watch once a week, so it's slow going. I'll be able to finally watch the movies though, as I never got around to them on the first watch
[3:58:49] <TheHeroAppears> great job pat
[3:58:50] <+UnderageBat> calebKek
[3:58:51] <SpaceCatStation> LUL
[3:58:52] <chicken_danger> you tried
[3:59:00] <Zebroneath> Maybe Coil is not the right answer
[3:59:05] <+xenoriddley36> @dekkitout is Fire Force any good?
[3:59:12] <Jrocy247> Literally walked into the bullet
[3:59:15] <RetributionP> ResidentSleeper LUL
[3:59:19] <$Smolkupo> Pat why the Hell are you using WC? LUL
[3:59:24] <SilverJakler> was that REaper
[3:59:30] <+xenoriddley36> I'm actually gonna be starting an anime called "Wanna Be the Strongest in the World"
[3:59:33] <chicken_danger> tease it
[3:59:34] <SilverJakler> I swear that was Reaper's VA
[3:59:35] <%dekkitout> It's a fun ride, but is tonally whiplashing at times
[3:59:38] <SpaceCatStation> @SilverJakler yes
[3:59:41] <mankeyfigh> @xenoriddley36 aren’t ALL the movies non-canon?
[3:59:45] <+DACH33ZMAN> @SilverJakler you are correct!
[3:59:45] <SilverJakler> I knew it
[3:59:50] <SilverJakler> @SpaceCatStation thank you
[3:59:56] <Jrocy247> So what does the Wolf howl mean?
[3:59:57] <+DACH33ZMAN> he even makes a refence to it if you get a 15 kill streak i think
[3:59:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> Death. Death could happen.
[3:59:59] <mankeyfigh> I never watched a Naruto movie for that reason
[4:00:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> That's pretty bad.
[4:00:03] <SpaceCatStation> he even has a DIE DIE DIE line if you're doing well enough
[4:00:04] <SilverJakler> @dach33zman thank you
[4:00:08] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> barb
[4:00:11] <%dekkitout> Wolf howl means three zones were captured
[4:00:12] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> rarb
[4:00:13] <chicken_danger> keep pulling
[4:00:22] <+xenoriddley36> @mankeyfigh no, they're directly reference in the show, and then the movie happens. It's kinda like a soft cannon. it happens, but you can skip it
[4:00:22] <SilverJakler> My one talent is to recognize voices good
[4:00:35] <chicken_danger> my advice is stop getting shot
[4:00:52] <Aydarkzero> ! ASS AT RISK !
[4:00:52] <%dekkitout> Avenge thy ass
[4:00:53] <%nofestu2> Avenge at own ass
[4:00:54] <%cvp5127> assvenger
[4:00:55] <+xenoriddley36> at least, Stong world, Film Z, Film Gold and Stampede are directly set up with an episode or two eluding to them
[4:00:59] <Oxybe> So when Pat gonna play a real FPS, like the Fortnites. Not this cool space robot wizard stuff.
[4:01:05] <Jrocy247> WHO'S SCREAMING
[4:01:08] <%mayorrev> WHO SAID THAT
[4:01:09] <+DACH33ZMAN> wooooaaah we are half way there WOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH

[4:01:34] <renegade_blade> puppG puppSnowball1
[4:01:34] <%mayorrev> yeah
[4:01:40] <Aydarkzero> Kappa
[4:01:44] <%WhereIsWill> its whats LIT in the streetz
[4:01:45] <SilverJakler> The lightsabers are honestly really fun to use ngl
[4:01:46] <mankeyfigh> @xenoriddley36 But are any of the events ever referenced in the anime later?
[4:01:46] <%dekkitout> Fortnite has lightsabers? Do they have yellow ones? sbfpScared
[4:01:48] <Jrocy247> So what benefits do you have when "The Hunt is on"?
[4:01:48] <seycheles> squadHmm
[4:01:51] <xshadowxx416> 2+2=fish
[4:01:52] <%mayorrev> @AngriestPat The camera centers and the combat is like fallen order, there's even a dark souls roll
[4:01:55] <%smugjorgen98> fortnite was no.1 downloaded game on switch too
[4:01:57] <+xenoriddley36> nah, kids are into some weird new game called Minecraft. it's got terrible graphics
[4:01:57] <+SolverCODO> hot like a diarrhea fart
[4:02:02] <TheHeroAppears> can someone cryo genically freeze me and bring me back when fortnite is over
[4:02:11] <alextrebeken> hes doing the nose touch
[4:02:11] <%dekkitout> @Jrocy247 Team can't cap the zones, kills are worth triple points
[4:02:16] <chicken_danger> you died and won a true paradox
[4:02:16] <mankeyfigh> I think My Hero is doing a good job with its movies
[4:02:21] <+Admiral_PopnFresh> mmm yes meel

[4:02:26] <Jrocy247> @dekkitout cool

[4:02:37] <%mayorrev> @dekkitout the lightsabers are 4 diff colors, green, red, blue, and purple
[4:02:40] <Neo_Kaiser> Fortnite is over, kids in school don't like playing it anymore.

[4:02:48] <%mayorrev> theyre named after the characters who wield em

[4:03:08] <+xenoriddley36> @Neo_Kaiser so what's gonna happen to all the fortnight money epic throws around?
[4:03:13] <Neo_Kaiser> D&D
[4:03:17] <Oxybe> "dont get shot and you'll be fine" is good advice IRL too

[4:05:08] <JDebss> Zero Frank Costanza fans
[4:05:11] <%araechfgc> is the battlepass system just D2 FOMO edition?
[4:05:11] <Oxybe> Fortnite 3 and Knuckles, featuring Dante from Devil May Cry
[4:05:16] <bear_breaker20> gambit can be fun when your the team steamrolling
[4:05:16] <%dekkitout> They really need to fix invader spawns, those thing are flimsy af
[4:05:18] <Slim_Lipid> I can't believe you don't remember Thanos yeeting fortniteland into a black hole live on stream. That earned it best ongoing game of the year over FFXIV
[4:05:20] <+xenoriddley36> but isn't Gambit one of the best X-Men? except for the one time he joined Apocalypse?
[4:05:21] <majindusto> How soon...who knows? dudsBless
[4:05:25] <bear_breaker20> otherwise....
[4:05:33] <chicken_danger> doors and corners

[4:06:25] <RetributionP> Pat is having "fun" with the video game
[4:06:26] <SilverJakler> Hey Pat, you ever think of getting into the Zero Escape series? I started playing them for the first time recently and they are NUTS
[4:06:30] <%smugjorgen98> FF14 is for weebs in the eyes of little children
[4:06:33] <+xenoriddley36> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw I love Darwins reaction to planet hulk that was going after everyone. His power, rather than adapt to the threat, just teleported him away
[4:06:35] <+DACH33ZMAN> same

[4:08:36] <seycheles> big patters
[4:08:37] <%dekkitout> He's trying
[4:08:45] <Neo_Kaiser> Why doesn't Pat just message all players and ask for quest boosting?
[4:08:47] <%smugjorgen98> why have PVP spesific quests
[4:09:06] <SpaceCatStation> because it's a monthly pvp mode?
[4:09:08] <Oxybe> Hey man, us atlantic time zone gets to see how pat fucks up an hour in advance. it's pretty funny
[4:09:09] <JDebss> noice
[4:09:12] <%DACH33ZMAN> stomp on them pat. make them rue the day they took your heavy
[4:09:16] <%dekkitout> @smugjorgen98 To have something to do, cause apparently, the pve isn't enough for some people
[4:09:17] <chicken_danger> SNEAKY GUNMAN
[4:09:22] <bear_breaker20> iron banner just started today
[4:09:30] <%smugjorgen98> well that explains it
[4:09:34] <+xenoriddley36> @Oxybe wait, are you telling me that you're from the future?
[4:09:45] <bardockodom> whens resident evil???
[4:09:46] <Oxybe> heck yeah. it 1am here
[4:09:47] <chicken_danger> you tried
[4:09:56] <+xenoriddley36> @Oxybe What's Bishop up to?
[4:09:58] <geoffster999> well this should make my grind trying to beat octopath actually enjoyable
[4:10:15] <JDebss> s'ok
[4:10:15] <%necrocannibal2> you have to grind to beat octopath?
[4:10:17] <+fingalights> Vader ??
[4:10:18] <%mayorrev> noscoped
[4:10:20] <%araechfgc> quick everyone in the good timezone open your presents. enjoy christmas before california even knows what happened
[4:10:22] <%cvp5127> tsk tsk
[4:10:25] <+xenoriddley36> @geoffster999 is Octopath any good? Debating on getting it on steam. Didn't want to get a switch just for it
[4:10:26] <%DedlokPM> @Oxybe what are the lotto numbers? mogsPog
[4:10:26] <TheHeroAppears> too bad the challenge wasn't for getting killed by rockets LUL
[4:10:27] <Oxybe> Fight'n.
[4:10:30] <%dekkitout> Pat please don't hollow out over Destiny 2 of all things
[4:10:33] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @xenoriddley36 yeah, it's a pretty cool ability
[4:10:40] <Oxybe> the lotto number is 9
[4:10:44] <Neo_Kaiser> Octopath should be on PS4.
[4:11:02] <chicken_danger> try not leaping into direct fire
[4:11:02] <bear_breaker20> in the dick*
[4:11:06] <+xenoriddley36> I'll have to check, but I'm pretty sure Octopath Traveler is switch and PC only
[4:11:09] <Habblewater> right in the donk
[4:11:15] <SpaceCatStation> dick shots are the real critical kills
[4:11:17] <geoffster999> it's ok honestly if it's not on sale don't grab it it feels more like work then anything
[4:11:20] <%nofestu2> is yooooooou
[4:11:26] <%necrocannibal2> how about instead of Octopath it's Octopat and the main characters are gingers
[4:11:26] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> LOUD SHITPOSTING
[4:11:36] <%dekkitout> Hey, better than the Last Word/Chaperone quests in D1...
[4:11:44] <JDebss> This is basically indistinguishable from Overwatch to me
[4:11:46] <Neo_Kaiser> Just open up chat and ask for boosting.
[4:11:46] <%Valdorick> Cbimbast is canceled, all challenges require heavy ammo now.
[4:11:47] <%DACH33ZMAN> how many quest steps are after this?
[4:11:47] <FLAWDREW> love you pat
[4:11:52] <Jrocy247> You should give up Kappa
[4:11:53] <%Madbearv> Madbearv subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Marry Christmas Pat you wonderful shitlord
[4:11:53] <Ner234> @ThatOneGuyYouSaw Contain your shitposts !
[4:11:54] <+xenoriddley36> @AngriestPat How do you feel about Henry Cavil almost losing out on being Super Man because he was in the middle of a WoW raid?
[4:12:22] <+xenoriddley36> LUL
[4:12:22] <%Madbearv> oof
[4:12:27] <%smugjorgen98> ooooooof
[4:12:28] <%necrocannibal2> LUL
[4:12:29] <Jrocy247> Dayum
[4:12:32] <%ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @Ner234 never! next time my shitposts shall be even more powerful
[4:12:34] <%DACH33ZMAN> hahahahahhahahahahahahhaahhahahahahaa
[4:12:40] <JDebss> agreed
[4:12:42] <%Zulrez> LUL
[4:12:43] <SGrim> @AngriestPat but he would have lost the chance to sell out.
[4:12:43] <%Valdorick> Teammate teabagged you.
[4:12:44] <%DACH33ZMAN> someone is actually trolling you
[4:12:51] <%nofestu2> apatWhat_TK
[4:12:57] <SpaceCatStation> naw it just be like that
[4:12:58] <Jrocy247> Do you not like Henry Cavill as Superman?
[4:13:00] <JDebss> WoW>Superman
[4:13:01] <%smugjorgen98> how can one person be this right
[4:13:02] <%linkster291> Pat you know the reason they make that last step the most annoying to get, if they didn't people would just walk away once they've completed all their bounties and quest. Got to keep the banner lobbies full.
[4:13:02] <+xenoriddley36> dude is great as Geralt though
[4:13:03] <Habblewater> and now he's the video game grandpa man
[4:13:04] <%araechfgc> we never would've been gifted with CGI superman face
[4:13:05] <%necrocannibal2> he hates Superman
[4:13:10] <%Valdorick> You don't Teambag, that guy is a maniac.
[4:13:14] <studleydoorite> I'm going to eat a bag of chips for christmas, I've earned it
[4:13:15] <%DACH33ZMAN> iron banner is always full
[4:13:21] <dickbuttwoman> What a conundrum
[4:13:28] <%DACH33ZMAN> iron banner has never had an issue with people queueing up
[4:13:28] <%the_mental_punk> I honestly can't believe thats superman as geralt. It's literally just geralt. I can't even see henry in the character at all
[4:13:31] <%Evil_John_Cena> What's the worst gift you've gotten besides clothes Pat?
[4:13:38] <dickbuttwoman> Eat shit by playing wow or eat shit by playing superman
[4:13:46] <JDebss> Good Overwatching
[4:13:48] <Wan6Saber> BAM
[4:13:55] <+xenoriddley36> @the_mental_punk I know right? He's literally perfect as Geralt
[4:13:59] <Oxybe> superman. selling out makes profit.
[4:14:01] <chicken_danger> He's so good at Geralt and everything else is awful I can't handle it
[4:14:12] <+xenoriddley36> Also, Henry Cavil is super huge into PC gaming
[4:14:13] <Neo_Kaiser> How come Geralt isn't ugly?
[4:14:13] <%araechfgc> Henry as injustice superman would be entertaining. but they're to big of cowards to do an evil superman movie
[4:14:14] <SpaceCatStation> Thundercrash super can go through that window
[4:14:25] <Naho_Saenoki> Murphy Chrimcram, everyone! succinHead_SA
[4:14:25] <%Valdorick> oof
[4:14:28] <Jrocy247> Pat should play Overwatch and how mad he REALLY gets at his teammates
[4:14:40] <Wan6Saber> ngngRekt jennLOL
[4:14:40] <%mayorrev> time to be SUPER TOXIC
[4:14:45] <%necrocannibal2> Snyder's Superman might as well be evil
[4:14:45] <%dekkitout> But he plays LoL
[4:14:50] <%Alpha8087> You did it
[4:14:52] <+xenoriddley36> he's really into Total War Warhammer 2 right now

[4:15:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 15m.
[4:15:10] <Neo_Kaiser> Destiny 2: "Urgh, I won"
[4:15:11] <%WhereIsWill> understandable
[4:15:14] <DrFacilier> You should switch to League, much less toxic
