[0:04:43] <goosematty> dreadtroid
[0:04:52] <+bugz_munny> Jaffe attempts to be relevant every now and then
[0:04:57] <%RealThiele> its also shitty as someone who has been in development do that to another dev. like zero self-awareness
[0:04:58] <Treasure_Vault> Is No More Heroes 3 off the schedule forever?
[0:05:05] <+bugz_munny> he said some other weird crap a few years ago, and then faded away into the ether

[0:19:43] <%InternetShis> uh ohhh
[0:19:44] <%KeiganOfAstora> How is it any less weird in Japanese?
[0:19:44] <%solracc25> terrrible
[0:19:45] <devanmuse> The original dub or the Netflix one?
[0:19:45] <HitchhikingThrough> ? Wait in the new netflix one?

[0:20:02] <%JoshManVGH> I thought it was the glasses kid that did that.
[0:20:04] <ExpressNode> Its been a while since I've seen Evangelion. Probably 10 years ago
[0:20:05] <%SinnerEbru> pat thats a great miles morales tweet
[0:20:06] <%InternetShis> It's probably British Texan
[0:20:07] <%asgard147> The one where they ran out of money
[0:20:07] <%SaiyanShoto> Fuck you the original one is fine
[0:20:09] <%NopeBadguy> Did you ever get around to watching Legends of the Guild?
[0:20:19] <%maskofmichael> the english dub gave us the Shinji rant though
[0:20:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> It's fine, c'mon dude
[0:20:24] <%greasypete00> i thought it was 4?
[0:20:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah what was that scene even about? Somethin about hivemind bullshit?
[0:20:30] <%SinnerEbru> wait theres been 3????
[0:20:33] <%JoshManVGH> @blainpld Do NOT read anything online about 14 Sentinels until you're done.
[0:20:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> do they translate shit differently too?
[0:20:38] <%Rumbutt> @megadblitz I mean it's near the end of the original series so like... that's a lot of context to cover in twitch chat
[0:20:41] <%solracc25> and diferent line deliveries
[0:20:41] <%polothegreatest> the meaning of that ending is nonsense, director was full on drugs
[0:20:42] <heartlesshealer> depends on which Shinji scream you want
[0:20:43] <teh_Question> i love the one where shinji was voiced by gilbert godfried
[0:20:43] <blue8moon> I don't remember a texas accent LUL
[0:20:44] <%Dova573> I watched the netflix dub, I enjoyed  it
[0:20:44] <%asgard147> Fuck it who knows
[0:20:44] <Blu_C> I like how in the rebuild they yell at him to get OUT of the robot.
[0:20:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> I like the Mega64 dub lol
[0:20:45] <%TheHateFish> @maskofmichael The Shinji Rant is great
[0:20:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> excellent
[0:20:49] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[0:20:50] <%BinaryFireball> everytime I watch a dub anime I feel like im watching yugioh and I cant take it seriously
[0:20:50] <slix3431> Hey Pat, I've considered doing a mindgoblin run of Disco Elysium
[0:20:51] <%NopeBadguy> Did you ever get around to watching Legends of the Guild on Netflix
[0:20:51] <HitchhikingThrough> "worthy of his grace"
[0:20:52] <%Dakuu75> Cursed
[0:20:52] <%JoshManVGH> Amazon, Funimation, Netflix, and ADV I think.
[0:20:53] <+JustToWatch> just make your own out of the 4
[0:20:53] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hes
[0:20:54] <@Ranryu692> Netflix localizers should be shot into the sun
[0:20:54] <Tracazoid> Third Children
[0:20:57] <hereiam407> I enjoyed the Netflix Dub
[0:21:00] <%scaryboisupreme> 2.0's new translation is SUPER bad
[0:21:01] <%KeiganOfAstora> He's exaggerating the accent
[0:21:02] <%BinaryFireball> they are
[0:21:03] <XuriScratch> The EVA dubs are no worthy of my grace
[0:21:03] <+JustToWatch> kinda

[0:22:06] <%Profmcstevie> Kinda
[0:22:07] <%KeiganOfAstora> LUL
[0:22:08] <%JoshManVGH> Beard means muppet?
[0:22:08] <%emperordread> No Gods or Kings, only beard
[0:22:08] <%Ipsenscastle> I thought that was food on your face???
[0:22:08] <+YPFrost> the beard is the lips
[0:22:09] <pepinillomaton> The rest of the face is r e d a c t e d
[0:22:11] <SilverFaustX> i just beat samus retuns for the first time, zero mission is better
[0:22:11] <%RealThiele> Beerd.
[0:22:12] <%InternetShis> It was all the testosterone from fighting idiots on the sidewalk
[0:22:15] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is beard
[0:22:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> admittedly, your beard has very high energy.
[0:22:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> makeup tutorial stream
[0:22:15] <vaishino> beard does a lot of heavy lifting
[0:22:18] <%Monkeyweed21> also the ghost blowjobs
[0:22:19] <%bob900000> I can't look away
[0:22:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> Beerd
[0:22:20] <hereiam407> That one band muppet
[0:22:26] <%stickislaw> But that's the best part
[0:22:27] <%Profmcstevie> Like those characters with no visible mouth just facial hair, we assume the location of the mouth
[0:22:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> that's the worst feeling
[0:22:31] <risenlp2> but I like moustache taste
[0:22:32] <%solracc25> and food sticks
[0:22:34] <XenoDandelion> tastes like soup
[0:22:34] <%KeiganOfAstora> Nah
[0:22:35] <$waxpants> you look like John Cena
[0:22:37] <ExpressNode> My hair does the same thing when I let it grow so I shave it
[0:22:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> I hate feeling my moustache on my lips
[0:22:39] <heartlesshealer> also the beard will steal food from you
[0:22:39] <Mattais88> DR Mayhem?
[0:22:39] <%KeiganOfAstora> Trimming is not manly
[0:22:40] <hereiam407> Doctor Teeth and the Electric Mayhem beard guy
[0:22:40] <%Ipsenscastle> just have a tastier beard, loser
[0:22:40] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm debating whether to trim my mustache or start curling it up
[0:22:40] <ToneBacas> but then you can't eat soup off your whiskers
[0:22:40] <Blank9> you get your mustache stuck in a can every sip
[0:22:46] <%Dakuu75> Day 2, of my all chili diet… i feel, i am become chili… itchy tasty…
[0:22:46] <%KeiganOfAstora> Real men don't trim shit
[0:22:56] <hereiam407> Yay
[0:22:56] <%stickislaw> Saves food for later so you can snack on the go

[0:23:04] <+Fooguwu> What's up my Whussies?
[0:23:05] <%ScreamLord> Bizzarro Pat has a full head of volumous hair and a baby face
[0:23:06] <hereiam407> Dread is the ultimate
[0:23:09] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat you should grow a mountain men's beard.
[0:23:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> personal grooming is the most masculine alpha shit you can do
[0:23:17] <%KeiganOfAstora> It covers your upper lip so your face literally becomes beard
[0:23:19] <%solracc25> spooky
[0:23:22] <+Mrbaconator> unmetal is that amazing metal gear parody right
[0:23:27] <%captainpodock> Dis Zangief get mad at that crazy neighbor?

[0:23:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat has the facial hair texture for righteous mutton chops
[0:23:46] <heartlesshealer> curly hair isn't good for mountain man length if you can get it to grow that long
[0:23:46] <+tempestzephyr> imagine pat with afro
[0:23:46] <%NopeBadguy> What kind of coffee?
[0:23:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> Beard balm is your friend
[0:23:53] <brandt_connors> Metroid Zero Mission has good controls.
[0:23:54] <%scaryboisupreme> At least you're not in your weird jim norton cosplay when you shave your beard and head
[0:24:00] <vaishino> price was right tho

[0:32:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @heartlesshealer well yea the solution is to collectively in all facets of our society shun racism and bigotry until those assholes stop spreading it and it dies with them
[0:32:50] <%hereiam407> I used to live in Florida, it's cool to cut it off, maybe make it an island
[0:32:56] <Vertigheist> shold've told that old stale croissant to stop acting like a child, cuz you know he's old
[0:33:04] <redwidow1358> There is no logic, they're all just incredibly self-centered and angry for no reason @tonebacas
[0:33:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @ToneBacas It's a form of unity. "We all have something in common. We were born here."
[0:33:12] <+TrevSmith222> Fortunately, a lot of racist southerners nowadays are extremely fake and will just say the racist thing behind your back.
[0:33:13] <@Ranryu692> Obviously the best defense when someone yells at you to speak French is to immediately start singing Plastic Bertrand's 1977 classic "Ça plane pour moi" at them until they run away
[0:33:15] <%hereiam407> Yeeha
[0:33:17] <+hoozasaurus> or a second boss phase. there was one enemy i struggled with and defeated, then the core x immediately flattened me lol

[0:33:27] <@Lion_kun> I don't get why Quebecers get mad about people speaking English when they can't even speak French.
[0:33:28] <%asgard147> "I will not have my face cleaned Father!" psaDogchamp

[0:34:46] <%hereiam407> Jeez
[0:34:46] <@Ranryu692> is that why nobody ever talks about Quebec City?
[0:34:46] <%Monkeyweed21> @heartlesshealer remember that in the 60's it was illegal to be gay in most places and segregation was seen by moderates as a neccessity, things CAN get better if people fight for it
[0:34:50] <%asgard147> ah, that's alota french limesSip
[0:34:51] <chaospudding> I'm gonna dip and watch the vods when I'm done

[0:34:52] <%Ne1son> And none of them actually speak real french
[0:34:53] <TenguGemini> So how poorly do they react to American tourists there?
[0:34:57] <%Niney_Who> That doesn't seem Legal

[0:35:08] <TioXyco> that's douchebaggery
[0:35:09] <ShinyVagikarp> should be illegal
[0:35:15] <%valriot> Its called Quebec City? LUL Sounds like a Sonic level
[0:35:15] <+Havictos> So?
[0:35:16] <+AutechreTwinAphex> you live in Quebec and can't speak French? good luck
[0:35:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> Ewwww that shit needs to get cancelled
[0:35:17] <TenguGemini> do they react that poorly to any other languages or is it just English?
[0:35:17] <Zeif00> yeah, y'all need to get the fuck outta there

[0:35:18] <%hereiam407> Hmmm
[0:35:19] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[0:35:19] <T_Sasquatch> Is it it just me that has zero attachment to their language
[0:35:20] <+Geronimo9037> hey hey hey quebec city is still a beautiful village
[0:35:20] <%captain_thickthighs> Dont forget change your menu from italian to french
[0:35:21] <Make_me_mad> Nothing is illegal if the cops don't punish them for it.
[0:35:22] <retrosadness> its illegal to break the law
[0:35:23] <%PrimalDweeb> Not ever...
[0:35:23] <%SinnerEbru> gotta love institutional racism
[0:35:23] <Blu_C> It's only illegal if they catch you.
[0:35:24] <%notsoy> no one would ever break the law to be racist
[0:35:25] <+emVulpine> They can't do that, that's illegal.
[0:35:25] <+Havictos> That won't stop them
[0:35:26] <%hereiam407> Yeh, just like the US South
[0:35:27] <%Rumbutt> YOU CAN'T DO THAT IT'S ILLEGAL
[0:35:28] <%Profmcstevie> But how? Law magic no break?
[0:35:32] <%NopeBadguy> Even if it was, the cops are too dirty to enforce
[0:35:32] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Who's gonna arrest them? French cops?
[0:35:33] <vaishino> how would they enforce that
[0:35:35] <%toolofparanoia> that sound fucking awful
[0:35:36] <%MegadBlitz> remember to always follow the rules!
[0:35:37] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Oh geeze I went to the bathroom what did I miss
[0:35:37] <pixelkenj> Neil Breen: ISNT THAT IMMORAL
[0:35:38] <%Niney_Who> Nothing illegal about posting it on the Internet then
[0:35:40] <%notsoy> because they would surely be punished for breaking the law to be racist Kappa
[0:35:43] <Dopamien> I'm calling the money police
[0:35:43] <%captain_thickthighs> Now you sound German
[0:35:44] <Virokwet> laws are very powerful
[0:35:49] <%MidnightBurst12> who would ever do such a thing? Kappa
[0:35:49] <%ShogunNoonto> @JoshManVGH sorry when i type fast i make spelling mistakes
[0:35:49] <%Profmcstevie> I'm sure the COPS in QUEBEC CITY care very much
[0:35:50] <%criticalink_> I'd just assume a business would have more oversight for that sort of thing
[0:35:51] <%notsoy> it definitely isn't like cops are racist, no sir Kappa
[0:35:52] <churropoppa> xenophobia is illegal so now discrimination has been defeated duh
[0:35:52] <%polothegreatest> it has tip included, wo its ok GlitchNRG
[0:35:53] <%ScreamLord> You
[0:35:55] <%JoshManVGH> Laws are IMPASTABLE to break
[0:35:58] <redwidow1358> Aw man, it sure would be a shame if hypothetically someone would break a law but the victim of such lawless behavior was the establishment charging English-speaking peoples more for their meals
[0:35:58] <+Namillus> "911 what's your emergency. Someone is killing you? That's illegal people can't do that. Hello?"
[0:35:59] <blue8moon> no one would ever break any laws ever
[0:36:00] <%hereiam407> I cannot believe you committed racism, I cannot believe you committed racism
[0:36:03] <TenguGemini> FrankerZ500 So is it just English they respond badly to or all non-french languages?
[0:36:07] <%bob900000> how true is the construction mafia
[0:36:08] <Treasure_Vault> After racism was outlawed in the US, it vanished overnight
[0:36:08] <@GeneralSCPatton> Ben Shapiro was right! We need to ban all crime! woolieFABRICATION
[0:36:12] <@Ranryu692> do they charge less if you speak proper French and showing them how it's done?
[0:36:18] <$realm_forge> Is Paige ok?
[0:36:19] <@Ranryu692> Showing?
[0:36:25] <Calek> lava is also sometimes a lie
[0:36:25] <+harrisboe> But if they charge you more, you can refuse to pay the extra charge, and they can’t do shit

[0:44:52] <+MushyCornbread> thats next level
[0:44:53] <+TrevSmith222> Good ole meth seeds.

[0:45:04] <ExpressNode> Didn't have a bad neighbor but I did have my brother's crazy ex throw my computer monitor and break it.
[0:45:04] <TheHeroAppears> gift them a good time :)
[0:45:05] <%JoshManVGH> Weed isn't illegal in some places
[0:45:05] <%Puhff> plant some CP in their lyard
[0:45:06] <%captain_thickthighs> can you be predjuice and high at the same time. Ive mostly seen drunk
[0:45:08] <%RealThiele> 1 plant if done right is enough for a household
[0:45:08] <@QueequegTheater> This doesn't work when weed is legal
[0:45:08] <placeholder03> Plant 7
[0:45:10] <%asgard147> Yeah, but ya need get all the equipment then and that's kinda a time sink
[0:45:12] <@Ranryu692> plant a dead body in their yard instead, then
[0:45:12] <%cvp5127> they digivolve
[0:45:18] <LoliKappa> it would be a bit wasteful to just make one and not use it, maybe whip up a batch while you're there
[0:45:20] <%hereiam407> Metroid equivalent
[0:45:23] <%cvp5127> burn the planet down
[0:45:25] <%Dova573> thats how they are in fusion
[0:45:28] <%solracc25> just nuke it
[0:45:28] <heartlesshealer> well, they also always drop resources, so it's a mixed bag of difficulty
[0:45:31] <Mattais88> The Thing
[0:45:33] <%VictorVonLouche> X parasite is the end if it gains space travel
[0:45:38] <Treasure_Vault> Like  w40k orc spores
[0:45:39] <HitchhikingThrough> It beats out nurgle's shit in 40k
[0:45:39] <%RealThiele> one oopsy and planet is fucked
[0:45:40] <%AncelDeLambert> It's as real as a Bio-Curse can get
[0:45:41] <MiamiMemory> My krokodil plant is growing well this season
[0:45:42] <TheAzureOracle> The planet HAS to go
[0:45:43] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Pat, the Necromorphs
[0:45:43] <%SaphronBlackbourne> What if we gave Umbrella the X
[0:45:44] <korpocalypse> fun fact: X parasites are based loosely on Candida Albicans
[0:45:45] <%Profmcstevie> It just consumes all biomatter living or dead and can ORGANICALLY INTERACT WITH DATA
[0:45:46] <Blu_C> GOOD JOB HERO
[0:45:47] <%hereiam407> Damn
[0:45:50] <+harrisboe> Within hours it spreads across the whole planet
[0:45:50] <%Dova573> like theres even human zombie x enemies in fusion is great
[0:45:51] <pylonmadness> My x parasite CANT be this cute!
[0:45:53] <%hereiam407> Kill em all Samus
[0:45:53] <%scaryboisupreme> that's how fast they did it in Fusion to SR388 too
[0:45:53] <devanmuse> Didn't you have that big quarantine door open for ten minutes before the entire planet got got?
[0:45:54] <comicalmond> so where are u gonna move too?
[0:45:54] <ammobasket> Time for the Chimera Ant arc
[0:45:55] <%solracc25> AMD dead too
[0:45:57] <Thepothero> The flood would like to have word s pat
[0:45:58] <%Monkeyweed21> the metroids were created JUST for X
[0:45:58] <HelluvaNohbody> it's the Thing on crack
[0:46:03] <%Arweynn> oh god, he said that didn't he. that includes you and the chozo doesn't it?
[0:46:03] <%Beetlewins> Yeah it's a big whoops maybe we shouldnt have eradicated their only natural predator
[0:46:09] <slix3431> Samus can kill anything
[0:46:10] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Is the X parasite worse than the necromorphs?
[0:46:11] <%JoshManVGH> The fact that The Galactic Federation didn't immediately move to glass the planet from oebit
[0:46:14] <ZaCrimsonDragon> Idk ever seen white people cause gentrification?
[0:46:14] <pylonmadness> Metroid dread made the X look cute imo
[0:46:16] <%brisk_dacat> But I’m a livening creature on this planet
[0:46:17] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt How were there any native species before the Chozo introduced the Metroid for popullation control?
[0:46:20] <@GeneralSCPatton> Think about how much supernatural or dimensional shenanigans creatures can do in this setting, and then think about the X mimicking THAT csbeastSetIn
[0:46:23] <heartlesshealer> and the solution -before- they got out was to still destroy the planet to get rid of the X
[0:46:24] <Treasure_Vault> Learn spanish?
[0:46:24] <%criticalink_> I just want to know why the X refill your ammo
[0:46:36] <LoliKappa> maybe all Romance languages are fine
[0:46:37] <doseofdhillon> !runtime
[0:46:37] <%Persona_EX> I just fucking finished your fucking vod and KNEW you’d still be reading this shit
[0:46:43] <%cvp5127> is the X just kirby?
[0:46:45] <+hoozasaurus> @criticalink_ they did that in fusion too
[0:46:46] <%Persona_EX> Hell yeah
[0:46:47] <Gamers_RiseUp> that makes it even funnier to me that the Federation gets on your case about blowing up the ship in Fusion
[0:46:47] <@QueequegTheater> Adam didn't give me permission to kill this X-parasite yet
[0:46:51] <slix3431> Racist?
[0:46:52] <HitchhikingThrough> ahh
[0:46:53] <%VictorVonLouche> Considering how fast X parasites took to infest a whole research station in a few short hours and that had quarantine measures, in fusion. They are dangerious.
[0:46:57] <Gamers_RiseUp> this existential-ass threat
[0:47:00] <korpocalypse> frankly we all could benefit from phones Kappa
[0:47:03] <TioXyco> elect the what?
[0:47:10] <%sandwich_jones> hit the dab fam
[0:47:10] <%Profmcstevie> Oh so they're BITTER
[0:47:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> lets go as hard as possible in the opposite direction
[0:47:12] <miucsa51> samus is just a walking petri dish at this point LUL
[0:47:14] <%Ipsenscastle> the CHURCH was in government??
[0:47:15] <%JoshManVGH> @criticalink_ Samus suit was infected by X, so it's part X, part Chozo biotech, part Metroid.
[0:47:15] <Dopamien> @criticalink_ they morph into freaky flesh missiles
[0:47:15] <TioXyco> Oh
[0:47:17] <%captain_thickthighs> So when your live long enough to become the villian
[0:47:17] <%SinnerEbru> holy fuck
[0:47:19] <+Havictos> @JoshManVGH In Fusion you learn the federation has corrupt elements that wanted to use the X as a weapon
[0:47:28] <korpocalypse> @miucsa51 LUL
[0:47:30] <Mattais88> Language laws are hilarious
[0:47:37] <%ShogunNoonto> Wait you guys don't have separation of church and state

[0:57:12] <LoliKappa> getting cursed by the Government to be Canadian sounds like the worst fate

[0:57:18] <Treasure_Vault> You're welcome!
[0:57:18] <$EsotericOdyssey> that happened to hawaii
[0:57:19] <%lumporr> if someone told me "hey you're canadian now" i'd be like "aight"

[0:57:47] <%hereiam407> Just make more fish
[0:57:47] <tcosmiclatte> @PatStaresAt As a Barbadian, I wouldn't care at all
[0:57:48] <%lumporr> they used the fish as currency
[0:57:48] <%Mr_Pylon> gotta let the danes get their share of the fish
[0:57:52] <%Dakuu75> it's like what EA does to game companies

[1:08:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Never played a Metroid game, but I know everyone loves them.
[1:08:11] <%notsoy> he's jealous of the skeleton because paige loves it
[1:08:12] <rearedlogarithm> Okay, I'm getting out, I just wanted to hear Pat shittalk Quebeckers.
[1:08:13] <%toolofparanoia> SKELMO VS ZANGIEF
[1:08:20] <godzookylives> he's keeping Skelmo in his place
[1:08:21] <%hereiam407> Hard question
[1:08:21] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Prime all the way
[1:08:28] <PanicSwytch> Both r good
[1:08:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> love 2D but Prime is the best
[1:08:32] <+ReiDuran> They both have their strengths
[1:08:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this one IS very good
[1:08:35] <Buttku> any plans to play the good life?
[1:08:35] <%moondog_> pat ignores the existence of abe the ghost
[1:08:36] <+KipTheSmuggler> gief about to throw hands at skeleton
[1:08:37] <+youngjwilliams> Evening folks
[1:08:37] <%hereiam407> This game is fantastic, but Prime is too immersive
[1:08:39] <ExpressNode> He's barking because Skelmo's jokes are dead ringers
[1:08:40] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Both are good, I prefer 2D
[1:08:44] <Spudmeister9000> will you play the primes if/when they come out on switch?
[1:08:45] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Both is my answer
[1:08:45] <Blank9> prime 2 I like best of primes
[1:08:45] <+emVulpine> Dread is making me want to revisit Prime after some time.
[1:08:53] <$sleepystardewfarmer> he has suddenly understood the concept of mortality, and the skeleton scares him greatly
[1:08:54] <%hereiam407> Swery!
[1:08:55] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Does Elmo and Zangief get along with SKelmo?
[1:08:56] <PanicSwytch> I just beat dread last nite so now i can watch ur stream
[1:08:58] <Buttku> ayyy
[1:08:58] <%Kevlar_Caviar> oh dang i joined just in time
[1:08:59] <%hewlettfan96> hewlettfan96 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to PatStaresAt's community! They've gifted a total of 4 in the channel! 
[1:09:00] <%hewlettfan96> hewlettfan96 gifted a Tier 1 sub to mugennoken! 
[1:09:00] <dd44dostivei> dread feels like smash
[1:09:00] <%hewlettfan96> Why is your dog so gaseous?? Also Do you still think SJW politics has ruined games forever?
[1:09:03] <heartlesshealer> the good life is coming out soon?!
[1:09:06] <%valriot> Prime games are all excellent but theyre more about slow exploration, than ZOOOOM
[1:09:13] <%hereiam407> Pat will now know what it feels like to be Elmo
[1:09:15] <+Armadelus> Metroid Prime was the first and only Metroid I have ever played...and I feel like I missed out on A LOT!
[1:09:15] <Ravingpyro> what's the best spooky game for spooky month?
[1:09:16] <+TombstoneTTromboners> I'm almost done my second playthrough of hard-mode, it rules
[1:09:18] <An_Armed_Bear> Dread is fantastic but I prefer Prime for all the environmental storytelling, scanning, and atmosphere.
[1:09:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> I thought we were playing some horror game tonight?
[1:09:24] <%hereiam407> @valriot Yeh, good point
[1:09:25] <thunderborn32> @PatStaresAt yo pat im 1 job away from having everything at 80 on ff14
[1:09:26] <%barrakuta371> awww
[1:09:30] <%RealThiele> tantrum not over
[1:09:30] <radregice> fullscreen him
[1:09:30] <Alzero83> @PatStaresAt appreciate thye feedback, I went ahead and bought B4B
[1:09:30] <+JavaManJoJo> Was trying to watch Northernlion play The Good Life today and it crashed on him four times in like 20 minutes
[1:09:30] <Aeroallways> Recently started playing prime through a mod of dolphin that gives it keyboard and mouse controls, works surprisingly well.
[1:09:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> like a bow tie
[1:09:34] <+hoozasaurus> hes a beautiful son
[1:09:34] <radregice> nvm he gone
[1:09:36] <Spudmeister9000> cleavage
[1:09:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> still got the V?
[1:09:37] <+KipTheSmuggler> gief is a queen
[1:09:40] <TioXyco> @thunderborn32 does that count BLU? Kappa
[1:09:43] <%UvBenServed> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:09:44] <%maskofmichael> It's a V, for Zangief
[1:09:45] <%BinaryFireball> DO IT
[1:09:45] <Ravingpyro> psaDogchamp
[1:09:46] <+Mrbaconator> pat can i request that you pet zangief some more
[1:09:47] <ExpressNode> He looks like a reese's peanut butter cup on four legs
[1:09:50] <%Cecrios> That is actual masochism
[1:09:51] <An_Armed_Bear> @Ravingpyro I'm going through Alien Isolation again
[1:09:51] <Tracazoid> Yeah does it count Blue tho
[1:09:52] <%hereiam407> Pat got this dog to deflate the chat into happiness, and it totally works
[1:09:52] <heartlesshealer> good luck on full 80 jobs!
[1:09:54] <%PrimalDweeb> Do it bitch!
[1:09:56] <Ravingpyro> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:09:56] <%asgard147> Do it!
[1:10:01] <%kn1ghtfel> Zangeif is a good looking boy
[1:10:03] <%hewlettfan96> @valriot Noo they’re the highlight of the franchise except for Prime 2s tedious dark world
[1:10:07] <@QueequegTheater> @thunderborn32 You can powerlevel BLU in like 2 hours with a friend at 80
[1:10:08] <T_Sasquatch> Im 2 jobs away and it's bard and whm ... I wanna die
[1:10:10] <OneThousandTomatoes> i don't think it's that hard
[1:10:16] <%BinaryFireball> trying to hit 60 in NW is ... its hell
[1:10:19] <%JoshManVGH> I have a friend who always gives away kittens and they mock me cause I can't have one right now!
[1:10:22] <Blank9> getting all to 80 was fun and felt freeing
[1:10:22] <fistynopunches> Fishing is Masochism
[1:10:22] <+Havictos> God that gravity suit looks so SICK!!
[1:10:23] <blue8moon> leveling is actually really easy in 14
[1:10:25] <%hereiam407> My body is ready
[1:10:26] <%hewlettfan96> Zangief is the best boy
[1:10:26] <@Ranryu692> I'm still working on my first, but I could definitely see myself getting there someday
[1:10:28] <+Delenay> do you have the oled? the load times are so much faster then mine
[1:10:33] <redwidow1358> Rescheduled because Pat is enjoying Dread more @nigelschnauzerpug
[1:10:34] <teh_Question> GODS THE FUCKING GRAV SUIT IS CLEAN AS ALL HELL
[1:10:36] <T_Sasquatch> @queequegtheater how does one unlock "friend" ?
[1:10:37] <%hereiam407> Shinespark baby
[1:10:39] <Tracazoid> Plus it's just kind of super doable if you play long term with rested XP and the like, might as well use it so eventually stuff gets leveled
[1:10:40] <%ospreyworks> Pat's "Whee" is so consistent, it tricked me into thinking it was an in-game sound
[1:10:41] <%Dregon_Azure> I leveled up an alt in FF14 and got all my jobs, gatherers, and crafters to lvl 69
[1:10:45] <+GalacticaPhanto> GalacticaPhanto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[1:10:47] <+thetunnelhomer> I'm happy that Metriod fans get so much food after so long a wait.
[1:10:50] <%hereiam407> And he barely used it last game
[1:10:52] <%Undenizen> YEAH just in time for stream
[1:10:55] <%Undenizen> what we doin?
[1:10:56] <%solracc25> GRAVITY SUIT
[1:10:56] <redwidow1358> @delenay OLED does not have faster load times
[1:10:56] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Did you see that levelling alts is going to be easier in EW
[1:10:58] <An_Armed_Bear> Problem is those early levels and early dungeons are roooouuuuuugh
[1:11:04] <+KipTheSmuggler> the screwy tack
[1:11:06] <%notsoy> i assume those blocks are for screw attacks?
[1:11:08] <%valriot> @hewlettfan96 I mean Prime Trilogy is my number 1 game, but 2D games are much more "go fast, sequence break", especially with Dread
[1:11:13] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> do tell
[1:11:13] <crash400> I'm watching this live for tge first time and it's excruciating not having a fast forward button
[1:11:14] <%solracc25> water and lava means nothing
[1:11:14] <%SaphronBlackbourne> It is???
[1:11:15] <%asgard147> wait what?
[1:11:22] <%MugenSandan> They haven't given details
[1:11:23] <%GetGianni> Congrats Samus getgiaSmileyblue Alright Captain Falcon don't worry bro I'm sure you're next, Bro...
[1:11:25] <Visorak6> first I'm hearing it
[1:11:25] <KingJackel> @notsoy yep
[1:11:25] <+StrikeTheErf> I heard that as well
[1:11:26] <+TombstoneTTromboners> TELL US
[1:11:28] <Ravingpyro> really??
[1:11:30] <%valriot> LUL
[1:11:32] <ohno778> wtf
[1:11:32] <%MugenSandan> probably a matter of exp calculations
[1:11:34] <+KipTheSmuggler> can someone mod in elevator music to these tho
[1:11:34] <Tooniearcade> huh
[1:11:34] <%hereiam407> YAY
[1:11:34] <$realm_forge> god damn Samus lookin fine as hell
[1:11:35] <%JoshManVGH> What!?
[1:11:38] <%Undenizen> @valriot this game looks really good for speedrunning
[1:11:39] <ohno778> why bring it up then
[1:11:40] <Tracazoid> LUL
[1:11:42] <+Delenay> hmmm i have to wait like a minute or more sometimes... maybe its the zone
[1:11:44] <+LastHazzerd> Queg posting
[1:11:46] <@GeneralSCPatton> Is it possible for me to do the free trial and also get the Endwalker pre-order bonus, or does buying the game and linking to Steam invalidate the trial?
[1:11:46] <%Monkeyweed21> quests and roulettes were mentioned as giving more XP
[1:11:48] <%Akizea> ?????
[1:11:48] <%RealThiele> gravity suit still lookin fine as hell
[1:11:49] <%TheHateFish> Money on, it'll just be "fuck you, +200% armoury bonus"
[1:11:51] <%notsoy> i wonder if the switch has enough power to actually run a modern-looking f-zero
[1:11:52] <%JoshManVGH> psaGib psaGib psaGib
[1:11:57] <%solracc25> chilly
[1:11:59] <%VyperVic> this bit is fun
[1:12:05] <%Akizea> @GeneralSCPatton buying the game invalidates the trial
[1:12:07] <blue8moon> looks cold
[1:12:08] <godzookylives> I love the gravity suit
[1:12:09] <@QueequegTheater> Yoshi didn't give details
[1:12:09] <+Havictos> Raven Beak left the AC on
[1:12:09] <%hereiam407> @notsoy Depends how modern you go
[1:12:12] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> No
[1:12:12] <Alzero83> nope
[1:12:14] <%VictorVonLouche> X parasite terraforming to FUCK METROIDS OVER
[1:12:15] <+Pachi3000> hmst
[1:12:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no
[1:12:15] <KingJackel> Not this icey
[1:12:18] <@QueequegTheater> But he urged people to wait
[1:12:18] <%cvp5127> ice is new
[1:12:18] <%hereiam407> No, it just turned cold
[1:12:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt this is the first zone
[1:12:26] <%TarikBot> At the end of last session "ADAM" told you the temperature of the planet is dropping
[1:12:28] <%VictorVonLouche> Yes
[1:12:32] <%TheHateFish> @GeneralSCPatton Buying invalidates trial, and if you just pre-order EW, you won't get StB and ShB until EW fully releases.
[1:12:33] <+Pachi3000> yes
[1:12:34] <@QueequegTheater> Looks like my stream is behind
[1:12:35] <%hereiam407> Yes, you were here before?
[1:12:35] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> It affects the places you started at as well
[1:12:36] <Zaphire_Saucypants> some of the ice is old. A lot more is not so old.
[1:12:36] <pixelkenj> It freezes once you get the Gravity Suit
[1:12:37] <%VyperVic> technically yes
[1:12:37] <Zezinizzle> @notsoy if they stick with 7th gen graphics it's definitely possible
[1:12:38] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Last thing Adam said was planet was cooling for some reason
[1:12:40] <zanzibarian_hamster> The opposite of global warming, lunular freezing
[1:12:40] <%solracc25> yup
[1:12:41] <+Pachi3000> story reason
[1:12:41] <%Dregon_Azure> i heard side quests were gonna give more exp and that the story was so long that you may get more exp than one job alone can handle
[1:12:43] <SunsetJack> Check your mission if you forget, Adam said temperature was dropping.
[1:12:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> YoshiP also mentioned that they usually designed stuff like relic quests with the idea that people have 1-3 max lvl jobs, but now they're going forward with the recognition that people like to level a lot of jobs
[1:12:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Hey Pat, could you explain Metroid to the people who know nothing about it?
[1:12:52] <KingJackel> Part of would have been, but not all of it
[1:12:55] <+Pachi3000> that's just 2D Metrood for you
[1:12:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a literal cutscene you can get from sequence breaking.
[1:13:07] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat You can replay dialogue in the menu
[1:13:07] <@QueequegTheater> @PrimalDweeb Roll around, kill bugs
[1:13:09] <+bluedude153> Do people who dont know what metroid is exist?
[1:13:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> @akizea Well shit, guess I'll be paying a sub earlier than I wanted
[1:13:17] <notabrobro> the X are chilling the planet specifically to kill you
[1:13:18] <%hereiam407> This is way easier to blast through
[1:13:23] <%PrimalDweeb> @QueequegTheater LUL
[1:13:29] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You can totally sequence break Prime
[1:13:30] <+gustavozxd> mobility in prime games was also never that interesting tbh
[1:13:30] <%valriot> Seems almost EVERY upgrade can be sequence broke, at least by 1-2 "steps", so cant do instant Gravity, but can get Gravity 2 steps faster
[1:13:31] <%Piemono> You're not getting through ice man
[1:13:34] <%solracc25> no one tell
[1:13:35] <Blank9> the sequence breaks get wild
[1:13:38] <%VyperVic> later
[1:13:40] <%hereiam407> Uh Uh Uh
[1:13:44] <%RealThiele> Prime 1 has early space jump iirc
[1:13:45] <+KipTheSmuggler> uwu?
[1:13:45] <+Havictos> Personally I don't see linearity as a detriment
[1:13:48] <SunsetJack> Don't bother exploring a lot, this is temporary.
[1:13:48] <%scaryboisupreme> Prime 2 had lots of sequence breaks
[1:13:49] <Saltmeisterr> most of prime sequence breaking is OOB stuff
[1:13:50] <@QueequegTheater> Hey look a bonfire
[1:13:51] <jorniev> the camera in prime was also awfull
[1:13:54] <%hereiam407> The Scrooge
[1:13:57] <%Dakuu75> Game seems a tiny bit too loud compared to Pat. Just me?
[1:14:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> there's some fun sequence breaking you can do in Dread that's a blast
[1:14:09] <hassanico2> Just you
[1:14:10] <pixelkenj> ice missiles are bad for melting ice
[1:14:12] <TioXyco> well, you can sequence break to that
[1:14:13] <%VyperVic> fire ice missiles at the ice, samus
[1:14:13] <Blank9> my favorite prime sequence break was early double jump the instant you land
[1:14:13] <%scaryboisupreme> You could totally go to the fortress as like the first area and get the light suit first thing
[1:14:15] <+TombstoneTTromboners> have it on the map?
[1:14:17] <%cvp5127> is it still sequence breaking if the developers plan for it?
[1:14:19] <%jyeowa> because goblins, yes
[1:14:20] <%VictorVonLouche> Getting the bombs in Dread is super easy too for a sequence break, you just need to know how.
[1:14:22] <hassanico2> OH BOY
[1:14:23] <%RealThiele> mind goblins
[1:14:27] <%hewlettfan96> The camera is absolute ass in prime
[1:14:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> CHOZO TIME
[1:14:34] <%hereiam407> X Bird Boy
[1:14:34] <+Double_Tap_That> !uptime
[1:14:34] <@Moobot> @Double_Tap_That I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 14m.
[1:14:35] <+Pachi3000> shield bro
[1:14:36] <OneThousandTomatoes> they talked about the new leveling stuff in the jesse cox interview, i don't remember details other that relic quests being mentioned
[1:14:40] <KingJackel> If you run up and counter him before the shield charge, you can destroy his shield.
[1:14:42] <hassanico2> god god this mashing tech!
[1:14:42] <blue8moon> this one's red
[1:14:46] <%solracc25> fast mash
[1:14:49] <%hewlettfan96> Bomb jumping is always great
[1:14:52] <%doctordinkus> doctordinkus subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Just photographed a wedding at a yacht club, I'll shoot your wedding for 5 canada bucks and a beer
[1:15:05] <+gustavozxd> @hewlettfan96 it was alright using the Wiimote controls
[1:15:05] <%greasypete00> these guys are such dark souls enemies
[1:15:05] <%RealThiele> funny part is with pats mashing speed he could legit speedrun this game
[1:15:08] <KasiCrafter> "Turn off auto fire indoors!" | "It's NOT, look!" [ MASH]
[1:15:12] <hassanico2> Remember: COUNTER AT him
[1:15:12] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> close
[1:15:12] <%cvp5127> closer
[1:15:13] <%AncelDeLambert> this one confused the HELL out of me
[1:15:13] <+Delenay> get closer
[1:15:16] <%VictorVonLouche> Run at him with parry
[1:15:16] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> closer
[1:15:16] <%bevyrage> you have to bait out the attack then slap the shield before he charges
[1:15:17] <%VyperVic> don't parry when he runs, parry when he smashes the shield dow
[1:15:17] <hassanico2> Counters aren't stationary
[1:15:19] <notabrobro> you gotta be right up next to it
[1:15:19] <%captain_thickthighs> on the shiny
[1:15:19] <+gustavozxd> prime controls like ass with the GameCube controller
[1:15:19] <%TarikBot> You gotta slap the shield maybe?
[1:15:20] <Blank9> running parry is a bit safer, you cover more distance with it
[1:15:21] <%Mr_Pylon> red bad
[1:15:21] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I think yougotta be closer
[1:15:22] <+McDerpus> hit during the flash, not after
[1:15:22] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt that's a very long deay
[1:15:24] <+zuzuxiv> i think you have to hit the shield itself
[1:15:24] <PanicSwytch> Get real close
[1:15:24] <+zoopbooploop> Think he's gotta get close
[1:15:24] <+emVulpine> You have to run in and counter as he slams his shield down.
[1:15:24] <@QueequegTheater> I got banned from 4chan again
[1:15:26] <+Pachi3000> it's a close counter
[1:15:26] <@QueequegTheater> lmao
[1:15:28] <scarman125> dash counter. you need to hit him when it flashes
[1:15:28] <%greasypete00> you have to melee them not counter it i htink
[1:15:28] <+clevernamewhere> out of range
[1:15:35] <%hereiam407> Beaitful
[1:15:37] <pylonmadness> You have to run up to him and counter
[1:15:38] <+TaurusOxford> RIP
[1:15:41] <%VictorVonLouche> They fuck
[1:15:41] <%JoshManVGH> Punch shield
[1:15:41] <+gustavozxd> @queequegtheater congrats
[1:15:41] <%lumporr> woah
[1:15:43] <Ethel9727> These guys SO are Rakshi from bionicle. I cannot unsee it
[1:15:43] <+StrikeTheErf> @PatStaresAt re: ff14 alts being easier to level, most common thought/rumor is that they're significantly increasing xp from side quests
[1:15:46] <%RealThiele> BIG damage
[1:15:47] <%Buzzard42> yeah he hits like a truck
[1:15:48] <+KaguraRaion> Really?
[1:15:49] <pixelkenj> spears hurt
[1:15:53] <+gustavozxd> how the fuck do you get banned from 4chan tho
[1:15:53] <%JoshManVGH> There you go!
[1:15:56] <+zoopbooploop> Pat, people take damage when they're hit
[1:15:56] <%Piemono> Yeah he was just hitting you for fun
[1:15:57] <%Ipsenscastle> you didn't notice he kept hitting you?
[1:15:58] <+McDerpus> what did you think he was hitting you for? candy?
[1:16:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> got a looooong reach when they get to that point.
[1:16:05] <crash400> what was he hitting you for then, Pat?
[1:16:06] <scarman125> why are all the names white?
[1:16:10] <Blank9> You've got those storm missiles too for big damage
[1:16:12] <krionik77> yeah, damage get big at near endgame.
[1:16:14] <%bevyrage> @QueequegTheater they've been randomly banning peeps who don't have premium accounts this year, and it's been inconsistent as to why
[1:16:15] <redwidow1358> What names?
[1:16:20] <%TheHateFish> @gustavozxd Relatively easily, actually
[1:16:21] <hassanico2> X BAAAAAAARF
[1:16:24] <%greasypete00> youd be surprised
[1:16:26] <+gustavozxd> they absolutely do
[1:16:28] <Calek> you'd be surprised
[1:16:29] <%Ynkubus_> @gustavozxd its easier than most think
[1:16:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i have no idea what does more damage
[1:16:34] <%valriot> Mashing is more if you can
[1:16:34] <%solracc25> not like that
[1:16:35] <%VyperVic> they do
[1:16:40] <hassanico2> Nope Pat's right for once
[1:16:44] <jorniev> BAAAAAARF
[1:16:46] <+emVulpine> Watching speedrunners, mashing the fuck out of the beam fire is super fast.
[1:16:47] <Blank9> as long as you get more than 1 lock they're nuts
[1:16:48] <%twistedj3ster> I never saw the shield parry because I melted him with missles
[1:16:49] <%SinnerEbru> fuck dread is so dynamic, all this movement is butter
[1:16:50] <%ForlornCarton> Plasma spam does the most damage, if you can mash the button like crazy
[1:16:51] <PanicSwytch> Ice missle deal a crazy amount of damage
[1:16:52] <%VictorVonLouche> tbh the rate you fire beam probably does more damage
[1:16:53] <+antpantz> no those missles hit harrd
[1:16:55] <%RealThiele> they do not people dont want to run this game because mashinng wins
[1:16:56] <+emVulpine> As in, fast DPS.
[1:16:56] <Aeroallways> Storm missiles don't even out dps regular missiles if you don't lock on perfectly
[1:16:57] <KasiCrafter> The DPs may be higher, but it makes you WAY more vulnerable
[1:17:00] <+TombstoneTTromboners> full heal time
[1:17:03] <+gustavozxd> gotta learn to move around while aiming though
[1:17:06] <%greasypete00> for the amount you can mash tho it may be worthlessly similar
[1:17:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> or close to it
[1:17:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeye
[1:17:09] <%Dova573> You can move while locking on
[1:17:11] <+McDerpus> storm missiles can do more if you can't get shots off and charge it while no shots can connect, otherwise plasma does more
[1:17:12] <KingJackel> For future playthoughs, you can store a shinespark before the fight then tackle him to skip phase 1.
[1:17:14] <hassanico2> Nah Red Xs are 5 bars, 50 missiles
[1:17:15] <%valriot> Mashing beam > Storm Missile > Charge beam, but some enemies have mash resistance
[1:17:16] <hassanico2> Not full heal
[1:17:19] <redwidow1358> They do a ton of damage, but maybe not as much as mashing the beam at your speed. The point is to aim at it in easy moments to fire while dodging, then prep to fire more after.
[1:17:20] <%Ipsenscastle> wow
[1:17:24] <jett_eyes> you made him goop
[1:17:24] <+gustavozxd> these guys are cool
[1:17:27] <Teras_ode> damn
[1:17:28] <+antpantz> uea
[1:17:28] <%TarikBot> Holy CRAP
[1:17:31] <hassanico2> "haha me explode into ice" - X Parasites
[1:17:32] <%cvp5127> never saw that
[1:17:32] <Blank9> you can just hold R to storm missile while running, no need to stop
[1:17:34] <+cermo55> yeah that got me 2
[1:17:41] <hassanico2> X Parasites weaponizing Ice has been a thing twice now
[1:17:41] <AzureFlame98> Beams do comparable damage to a single storm missile the difference is beams fire as fast as you can press the button
[1:17:41] <Treasure_Vault> Weird how Samus and Kirby are both Nintendo flagship characters, and bother eldritch abominations
[1:17:42] <+cermo55> counter those
[1:17:46] <+TombstoneTTromboners> if only samus had a lava beam
[1:17:46] <Treasure_Vault> both are*
[1:17:46] <%Dakuu75> I still don't know how to kill those guys
[1:17:58] <%Dakuu75> oh... ok...
[1:17:58] <redwidow1358> You shoot them a lot
[1:18:08] <%VyperVic> @dakuu75 parry
[1:18:09] <%RealThiele> counter wins, always
[1:18:16] <hassanico2> YO
[1:18:17] <redwidow1358> They wait a sec before exploding, so just move out of the way
[1:18:18] <hassanico2> FREE TANK
[1:18:18] <eustine> How is samus an eldridtch abom?
[1:18:25] <%RealThiele> E
[1:18:33] <%TheWinged7> E
[1:18:35] <+Pachi3000> weiner
[1:18:36] <+gustavozxd> that guy is counter only or just avoid him
[1:18:38] <hassanico2> ...Free Tank PART I guess. Boo.
[1:18:38] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Icy?
[1:18:43] <Treasure_Vault> haha, icy
[1:18:49] <@QueequegTheater> @bevyrage Oh it had nothing to do with that
[1:18:50] <%Monkeyweed21> dont use ice missiles on the ice monsters
[1:18:51] <+harrisboe> Samus is a slurry of dna but she’s not eldritchian
[1:18:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @eustine part metroid
[1:18:57] <@QueequegTheater> I was shitposting in the WoW general
[1:18:58] <hassanico2> This puzzle is cool

[1:19:32] <%Piemono> Charge beam pierces ground
[1:19:33] <%notsoy> charge beam splash hit through floors btw
[1:19:34] <%RealThiele> diffusion hits udnerground
[1:19:44] <%SinnerEbru> was it worth it
[1:19:48] <PanicSwytch> Some of the speed boost puzzles r brutal but luckily i got them done
[1:19:48] <@QueequegTheater> yes

[1:21:36] <+gustavozxd> shinespark is the jump button with no directional input

[1:22:30] <+gustavozxd> did pat play Metroid 2 remake?
[1:22:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i don't believe so
[1:22:42] <redwidow1358> He did not
[1:22:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Just like in Fusion
[1:22:45] <hassanico2> Yeah that's a Fusion thing
[1:22:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> I think is the first 2D metroid he's ever really played
[1:22:54] <hassanico2> If an X is flashing in Fusion, it will respawn as an enemy
[1:22:59] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> need Time Stop
[1:23:01] <%RealThiele> save those GBA memory bits
[1:23:07] <HumanZac> ah yes, time stop!
[1:23:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this room is now FROZEN
[1:23:12] <Zezinizzle> He's more familiar with the prime games
[1:23:13] <+tsmasher1000> I'm so glad that the new Metroid knocked it out of the park. Hopefully it sells well and they make more
[1:23:15] <%VictorVonLouche> X have made it ANTI METROID

[1:26:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Pat coping. Nice to see.
[1:26:22] <Ethel9727> Paige is going to live forever because Pat has said she's dying so often. HIs stand is stronger than death itself.

[1:30:53] <%JoshManVGH> I'd like to imagine Pat and Paige have a giant Squid Games piggy bank, and all their stupid bets go into. Whomever survives life the longest gets the pig.
[1:30:53] <Halospaz117> Dude this game is so good, it makes me as happy just thinking about it that DMC5 made me when it came out
[1:30:53] <+TombstoneTTromboners> absolutely love this though

[1:31:47] <willyfreshness> They cant have my Bed
[1:31:50] <%hewlettfan96> I think you’ll have to get rid of another pillow since Pat hotboxed it to death
[1:31:53] <willyfreshness> My Bed
[1:31:59] <CoffeeCobra> @Calek They are, but I don't think I could play through the older ones as well as I could this one, I'm really glad it exists because it fits right up my alley

[1:34:03] <+antpantz> ight goodluck
[1:34:04] <CoffeeCobra> must contain the urge to backseat game NotLikeThis
[1:34:06] <%crimsonharvest> that pink goo does 40 per tick

[1:34:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> lmao
[1:34:11] <%hereiam407> @harrisboe zThis isn't the experiment from earlier, that we saw in that room?
[1:34:12] <+cermo55> Samus rarely has to kill a thing only once
[1:34:14] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I died to the floor spam the first time
[1:34:18] <%greasypete00> it takes some getting used to this boss is weird
[1:34:19] <%Buzzard42> probably the best boss in the game
[1:34:20] <%KetsuoTaberu> LUL
[1:34:22] <+tsmasher1000> f
[1:34:22] <%Niney_Who> This is the most B oss Fight boss in the game
[1:34:23] <%hewlettfan96> Holy shite That looks amazing
[1:34:23] <+Getter404> You tripped on its pinky. And exploded.
[1:34:25] <%TarikBot> Is it just me or does storm missile suck
[1:34:25] <@QueequegTheater> F
[1:34:26] <%RealThiele> last bosses are git gud checks
[1:34:26] <+TaurusOxford> Good attempt. LUL
[1:34:27] <Treasure_Vault> walked into him
[1:34:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> stood on the ouchie floor, classic mistake
[1:34:27] <%keyoray> LuvSign
[1:34:28] <%crimsonharvest> this fight makes me really wish for Dark Souls lack of contact damage from bosses
[1:34:30] <SunsetJack> I died like that too.
[1:34:30] <+vaderxyz1970> How cool would it be if earth animals could shoot lazers out of their mouths
[1:34:30] <%cvp5127> can pat beat it the stylish way
[1:34:31] <%JoshManVGH> The arms have hurtboxes
[1:34:33] <+fetrigon> F
[1:34:33] <Teras_ode> bork
[1:34:33] <+HakureiIllusion> This is the thing getting zapped on the floor earlier, yes
[1:34:33] <CoffeeCobra> all I CAN say is, he's not as hard as he seems when you get the rhythm down, but that goes for most bosses in this game
[1:34:33] <redwidow1358> This boss takes some work ngl
[1:34:33] <Aeroallways> def the best boss in this game
[1:34:34] <%hereiam407> get good
[1:34:34] <PanicSwytch> Floor goo deals damage
[1:34:34] <%PrimalDweeb> F
[1:34:36] <KingJackel> @hereiam407 yep
[1:34:37] <+LastHazzerd> was that one of them Canadian resets i been hearin' about?
[1:34:39] <+Delenay> space jump is nice here
[1:34:40] <+attoram> I think I died to this boss the most of any of them
[1:34:41] <Halospaz117> Floor do boo boos
[1:34:43] <%RealThiele> storm missiles DO suck imo
[1:34:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I found the ice missiles weirdly more consistent with this boss.
[1:34:46] <+harrisboe> @hereiam407 yeah it’s the experiment. But it’s easy to get that guy mixed up with the first boss
[1:34:47] <shotgang86> nice boss, and I died to it a bunch of times. once it clicks for you it gets a lot easier
[1:34:47] <@GeneralSCPatton> Spicy ground
[1:34:49] <%hewlettfan96> Pat stop shafting for one minute your upsetting the dog
[1:34:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> boo boo floo

[1:35:04] <+Pachi3000> the floor is painful shaving cream
[1:35:04] <%JoshManVGH> This boss is a fuck but its a blast once you figure it out
[1:35:06] <$realm_forge> If anyone can beat it it’s you. Pro gamer Chilibottom Pat
[1:35:07] <T_Sasquatch> People talk alot about Metroidvanias but man ive never seen one remotely as interesting as actual Metroid (inb4 hollow knight )
[1:35:10] <heartlesshealer> zangief hates this boss
[1:35:12] <Saltmeisterr> this boss has a cool quick kill
[1:35:12] <shotgang86> missed parry
[1:35:14] <olaksi> missiles programmed to home only in 2 dimensions
[1:35:16] <+Clyderso> Ahhhh thats a bunch of SOPRANOS
[1:35:18] <zanzibarian_hamster> We deadspace now
[1:35:20] <Halospaz117> Pat, you BETTER land that counter
[1:35:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> get tricked :)
[1:35:26] <+gustavozxd> it's basically this game's version of that annoying boss that gives you the power bomb in Metroid 2 remake
[1:35:27] <%hewlettfan96> The boss looks like a pain ooooo
[1:35:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> And that's how we became the SOPRANOS
[1:35:39] <+TombstoneTTromboners> HERE IT COMES
[1:35:39] <%RealThiele> forgets about his flash shift
[1:35:40] <zealsteele> THE FLOOR IS LAVA
[1:35:41] <CoffeeCobra> I remember watching a video of someone who just used space jump to avoid the big leggie slashes but you can easily dodge them with 1 (one) jump LUL

[1:36:28] <KingJackel> There is a quick kill trick you can do in this phase, but it involves a tight shinespark execution during the wind attack

[1:36:49] <%greasypete00> i hate the wind attack
[1:36:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> a perfect moment for a shinespark
[1:36:51] <redwidow1358> Flappy Chozo
[1:36:52] <%cvp5127> shinespark him
[1:36:52] <%hereiam407> Remember, this game is influenced by Dark Soulds

[1:36:53] <Treasure_Vault> Now Shinespark him
[1:36:53] <+antpantz> this is what you get for undetale slander
[1:36:53] <$TenguGemini> So this is one of the best fights in the game imo

[1:38:12] <placeholder03> no
[1:38:16] <%RealThiele> shinespark if you hit a boss with it melts just about anything

[1:38:36] <%hewlettfan96> Paige keeps jumpin in
[1:38:37] <KingJackel> You can store a shinespark, then hit him at the end of the attack.

[1:39:28] <@GeneralSCPatton> AH FUCK
[1:39:28] <ToneBacas> nice try
[1:39:28] <%hereiam407> That was weak
[1:39:30] <redwidow1358> THAT WAS A GOOD RUN
[1:39:33] <+Pachi3000> it's like right in the top mid to avoid that one
[1:39:33] <KingJackel> Yeah, the hitbox on that attack is weird
[1:39:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can do it, Pat. I believe.
[1:39:34] <%JarlSvog> LUL LUL
[1:39:34] <TyphoonSwirl> damn

[1:39:42] <Visorak6> MEDOCRE
[1:39:43] <CoffeeCobra> do I hear a good boy?
[1:39:43] <%solracc25> that one is very specific
[1:39:43] <%hereiam407> Barely came out of the foreground
[1:39:44] <%barrakuta371> arcast1Oof
[1:39:44] <+gustavozxd> the place you have to hide is a hitbox before he slashes
[1:39:46] <Make_me_mad> It's okay Pat. You were almost cool.
[1:39:46] <Reveresao> really should just stay in the center for those atks
[1:39:51] <Ravingpyro> squeaky
[1:39:55] <%hewlettfan96> That was a MEDIOCRE run
[1:39:57] <jorniev> did pat ever finish no more heroes 3?
[1:39:57] <+Pachi3000> oof
[1:40:03] <%toolofparanoia> sequence switching!
[1:40:06] <%RealThiele> pasta la pizza
[1:40:06] <kazadaz> Hold on, Turbo Killer
[1:40:08] <%hereiam407> @jorniev No
[1:40:12] <%Kiyosuki> Squeak squeak
[1:40:18] <CoffeeCobra> Flash Shift the second he stops
[1:40:20] <jorniev> damn
[1:40:20] <+gustavozxd> don't forget Metroid Dread is an anime fighter, and thus, you can triple air dash
[1:40:23] <%hereiam407> @jorniev I think its last on his list, or not at all
[1:40:26] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I have no idea  how to dodge that last swipe without Space Jump, I beat him without it and just had to dodge the rest and tank it
[1:40:27] <+clevernamewhere> invincible durin swipes
[1:40:40] <%hereiam407> @jorniev He said it was really cool, just he wanted to play other stuff
[1:40:47] <+gustavozxd> LUL YEAH ITS FUCKING SICK
[1:40:47] <Halospaz117> it works REALLY good
[1:40:49] <%hewlettfan96> @jorniev Nah and he probably never will now, cause laziness and schedule RIP psaWhat
[1:40:52] <Make_me_mad> It's very effective.
[1:40:53] <%MrBorisMakarov> ITS EFFECTIVE THO
[1:40:53] <+Clyderso> Samus is a pro gamer
[1:40:53] <Treasure_Vault> She'll stop doing it when it stops working
[1:40:56] <+antpantz> thats pretty good
[1:40:58] <miucsa51> LUL
[1:40:58] <%hereiam407> Diect confrontation
[1:40:59] <Virokwet> foolproof plan
[1:41:00] <%PrimalDweeb> I mean, if it works...
[1:41:01] <TheAzureOracle> I mean, it's an effective go-to
[1:41:03] <%RealThiele> oh no missiles in my mouth my weakness!
[1:41:04] <ohno778> I can't wait till they give her a sword for the next game.
[1:41:05] <lealea4> Because it always works pat! LUL
[1:41:11] <+gustavozxd> what if I released a charge shot inside your mouth
[1:41:13] <Louie_Salmon> Samus is just DoomLady
[1:41:16] <kinkade_77> gun to mouth is usually pretty effective
[1:41:21] <ToneBacas> this flappy bird shit is awful
[1:41:24] <+gustavozxd> what if... 😳
[1:41:26] <+Namillus> @ohno778 I'd comment on that but spoilers lol
[1:41:29] <arizenarkana> They even do it in Other M which says something.
[1:41:30] <mr_mister0> aw
[1:41:32] <+youngjwilliams> shes just a gunlance user
[1:41:36] <%Niney_Who> Just gotta shoot mid air then instantly spark
[1:41:37] <+Con_fusedDX> y + b to do it in mid air
[1:41:40] <%solracc25> you don't
[1:41:40] <%Buzzard42> Flappy Bird is cool
[1:41:44] <Explodincatz> neutral jump
[1:41:46] <SunsetJack> Has to be done from a neutral position.
[1:41:46] <%Buzzard42> it's a fun phase
[1:41:51] <fcKurl> wtf you can do it in mid air?
[1:41:53] <%Horosho> neutral jump if you wanna shinespark
[1:41:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yes, remember, shoot mid air
[1:41:55] <+LastHazzerd> it's not free
[1:41:58] <%jyeowa> it doesn't even look like you get time to
[1:42:00] <ohno778> mask off metroid may cry
[1:42:01] <kinkade_77> you can use shine spark in this boss?
[1:42:11] <mr_mister0> Press B when neutral jump, Y+B when spin jumping
[1:42:12] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:42:13] <+Clyderso> OOF
[1:42:14] <+zuzuxiv> RIPPPPP
[1:42:14] <fcKurl> F
[1:42:14] <Halospaz117> too close
[1:42:15] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:42:15] <+Namillus> You have JUST enough time to shinespark his face off
[1:42:15] <%Ipsenscastle> F
[1:42:16] <+gustavozxd> I was happy I enjoyed all boss fights in all their phases
[1:42:16] <+zoopbooploop> Yep
[1:42:16] <redwidow1358> Too close
[1:42:16] <saddlezilla1> noooo
[1:42:17] <+antpantz> HAAA
[1:42:17] <TioXyco> @kinkade_77 yeah, after the flappy bird segment
[1:42:17] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt neutral jump to aerial shinespark
[1:42:17] <SunsetJack> Nooo
[1:42:17] <ToneBacas> parry god?
[1:42:17] <+HakureiIllusion> Timing is tricky, best to just beat him normally on the first playthrough
[1:42:17] <+Pachi3000> NOOOO
[1:42:18] <%RealThiele> LUL
[1:42:18] <%MrBorisMakarov> LUL
[1:42:19] <+TaurusOxford> @PatStaresAt you have to be in a neutral jumping position to do a mid-air shinespark. Hit shoot just before jump
[1:42:19] <%TheWinged7> LUL
[1:42:19] <fierysnowflakes> F
[1:42:20] <+vaderxyz1970> wiff
[1:42:20] <pixelkenj> :)
[1:42:20] <%SinnerEbru> rip
[1:42:20] <@Ranryu692> there used to be a Flappy Bird cabinet in the Walmart near where I used to live
[1:42:20] <KingJackel> The trick is to store the spark it right before the first big wave (2nd to last wave).
[1:42:21] <hassanico2> @kinkade_77 second phase yes
[1:42:21] <Visorak6> too close
[1:42:22] <+fetrigon> OMEGALUL
[1:42:22] <+LastHazzerd> hit boxes
[1:42:24] <+gustavozxd> the final boss is some fucking wild ass shit
[1:42:28] <CoffeeCobra> @fcKurl I've seen people do Shinesparks in midair so YUP
[1:42:29] <%Korzodin> Be a smooth operator, Pat
[1:42:30] <Halospaz117> PAIGE WHY DID YOU DO THIS
[1:42:31] <%Kiyosuki> Dat jaw
[1:42:34] <lilmac64> I love how Nintendo didn't want Samus doing actual bounty hunting in Prime because "She'd never do something like that" But are somehow A-Okay with having her barrel stuff ever other boss in Dread.
[1:42:35] <%Niney_Who> It does not explain how to shinespark mid air
[1:42:35] <%RealThiele> paige keeps showin pepperonis
[1:42:43] <+gustavozxd> @ranryu692 like an arcade cabinet!? LUL
[1:42:44] <+MoFroGT> unavoidable chin move?
[1:42:45] <%Horosho> ye
[1:42:46] <+TaurusOxford> yes
[1:42:47] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[1:42:47] <+antpantz> ues
[1:42:47] <%Kiyosuki> Zangief at the edge of his seat lol
[1:42:48] <pepinillomaton> You can only do it during neutral jump, not spin jump
[1:42:50] <+Con_fusedDX> If your spinning y + b works
[1:42:53] <%Buzzard42> let go of the stick and push B
[1:42:53] <Explodincatz> correct
[1:42:53] <CoffeeCobra> I have a hard time with the Shinespark too NotLikeThis
[1:42:54] <+Pachi3000> ye
[1:42:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I usually firmly hold it.
[1:42:54] <pixelkenj> b neutral, and then tilt your direction
[1:42:55] <+youngjwilliams> yb while spin jump too
[1:42:55] <KingJackel> Quick fact the game doesnt tell you: press Y+B to do it in the air
[1:42:57] <%Buzzard42> B then a direction
[1:42:57] <saddlezilla1> GiEF
[1:42:57] <%Niney_Who> Well no you'll shinespark on the ground then
[1:42:59] <Blank9> neutral jump, then direction you wanna go
[1:42:59] <redwidow1358> Squeakgief
[1:43:01] <%Monkeyweed21> B, then the direction
[1:43:03] <mr_mister0> you can also y+b when spin jumping
[1:43:06] <Halospaz117> @PatStaresAt You can shoot midear to get out of a spinjump and set up for shinespark
[1:43:08] <TyphoonSwirl> GET EM PAT
[1:43:09] <SunsetJack> Yea, or shot you to stop spinning and then press B.
[1:43:10] <%Niney_Who> He can't Neutral jump though
[1:43:14] <%jyeowa> chat i guarantee you this y+b shit is going to fry pat's brain again
[1:43:14] <%AncelDeLambert> that's why we tell you about the fire plus jump while spin jumping
[1:43:17] <%Niney_Who> If you hit B to neutral jump he'll just shinespark on the ground
[1:43:20] <%hereiam407> Lamos
[1:43:21] <Calek> he just hits hard
[1:43:23] <%Buzzard42> he's just really punishing
[1:43:23] <CoffeeCobra> thank you chat for revealing the secret to spinjump Shinespark
[1:43:24] <+MoFroGT> pat is gonna eat those words lol
[1:43:26] <pixelkenj> first try
[1:43:32] <devanmuse> You're not David Jaffe
[1:43:33] <hassanico2> The strat Woolie developed to dodge this boss' beam was ABSOLUTELY DERANGED
[1:43:37] <+antpantz> hes not but really cool looking
[1:43:38] <%hereiam407> Its not baby easy though
[1:43:38] <%rkbinder> Never played SNES games
[1:43:38] <TioXyco> people nowadays cry if they face a little bit of dificulty
[1:43:42] <fcKurl> i didnt know this was the hard boss i had a harder time with others i think
[1:43:43] <ArthurDoyleRPG> It's hidden tech that only super fans know
[1:43:47] <hassanico2> He would stay on one side and try to spin jump it with the wall
[1:43:49] <%solracc25> nah future bosses have some bullshit
[1:43:49] <wqorst> modern gaming says bosses should be one shots unless you're a souls weirdo
[1:43:53] <hassanico2> Delusional dodging tech
[1:43:56] <%hewlettfan96> He’s just a really hard opening boss, and he looks cool
[1:43:59] <saddlezilla1> The one that gave me a hard time was the thunder bug
[1:43:59] <+gustavozxd> it's tough but not insane tough
[1:44:01] <%Niney_Who> I'm not a super fan this was like my second metroid I just learned how to do it
[1:44:01] <+Pachi3000> he says on his 4th try
[1:44:03] <CoffeeCobra> @hassanico2 I was GONNA watch that but then I saw Pat online LUL
[1:44:03] <+vaderxyz1970> Its not gamer journalist easy
[1:44:11] <+transporterthesequel> PERFECTLY timed squeak.
[1:44:11] <%AncelDeLambert> apparently Dave Jaffe lost his SHIT at basic destructable walls at the beginning of the game and rage quit
[1:44:22] <%hewlettfan96> Souls is not THAT hard hot take
[1:44:23] <hassanico2> @CoffeeCobra there's always 2x speed Youtube but yeah LUL
[1:44:27] <pepinillomaton> In spin jump Y + B
[1:44:28] <hassanico2> AW
[1:44:28] <+zuzuxiv> close!
[1:44:30] <mr_mister0> OOOOOO
[1:44:30] <hassanico2> THE DODGE
[1:44:31] <%hereiam407> @AncelDeLambert Did he ever play a Metroid game?
[1:44:32] <moonbearbacon> can anyone else hear the squid boss noise from mario sunshine?
[1:44:33] <Halospaz117> SO FUCKIN CLOSE
[1:44:34] <redwidow1358> AWWWWW
[1:44:34] <SunsetJack> Aw
[1:44:35] <hassanico2> Good attempt!
[1:44:35] <5paceIoser> why do people have to pretend video games are hard
[1:44:36] <+Pachi3000> noooo not then
[1:44:38] <Explodincatz> mees
[1:44:40] <KingJackel> So close
[1:44:41] <Aeroallways> if you refuse to read telegraphed attacks you'll have a bad time with this game.
[1:44:42] <TioXyco> it was a good atempt
[1:44:42] <+tempestzephyr> damn
[1:44:42] <%hewlettfan96> Awwwwwwww
[1:44:43] <Halospaz117> He's got the idea at least
[1:44:44] <lilmac64> It's hard like a 90s or early 2000s Nintendo game, and no one knows how to deal with that anymore.
[1:44:45] <+fetrigon> next time
[1:44:53] <%AncelDeLambert> @hereiam407 I guess not
[1:44:56] <+BoboDaHobo> some people just bounce off of games that require you to die a few times to learn the patter fight. they always want to just barely win on the first attempt
[1:44:57] <CoffeeCobra> wait did someone seriously ragequit at Cataris? or? LUL
[1:44:57] <%hewlettfan96> Next time
[1:44:58] <+Delenay> when ht roars is when he comes back into the forground to hit
[1:45:01] <hassanico2> This guy's slash effect is so basic and lame, why is it SO COOL?!
[1:45:06] <PanicSwytch> @kingjackel So pressing y+b let's u shinespark in mid air?
[1:45:10] <+BoboDaHobo> pattern of the fight*
[1:45:12] <%Korzodin> Curiosity kills the Pat
[1:45:12] <hassanico2> @CoffeeCobra david jaffe
[1:45:23] <%Deft_Thought> This is a neat boss
[1:45:26] <%hereiam407> @BoboDaHobo Just shoot at the target and you win, no difficulty please
[1:45:30] <Halospaz117> @PanicSwytch It lets you cancel the spinjump animation, which lets you shinespark
[1:45:31] <hassanico2> GG
[1:45:34] <hassanico2> FUCK YOU
[1:45:34] <+McDerpus> who tf is David Jaffe anyway?
[1:45:36] <hassanico2> MORE PLASMA
[1:45:36] <hat_under_bread> These are some impressive God of War grapple sequences.
[1:45:36] <%RealThiele> gottem
[1:45:37] <+antpantz> oh yea pat, phase shift doesnt interrupt storm missle charge
[1:45:37] <+tsmasher1000> YEYEYEYE
[1:45:38] <+tsmasher1000> GG
[1:45:40] <CoffeeCobra> @BoboDaHobo look I have ADHD, I have NO patience whatsoever, and have zero Metroid experience, but even I beat the game LUL that's just sad
[1:45:40] <%greasypete00> bad bitch samus
[1:45:41] <%baka_sugoi> ded
[1:45:42] <Asuterisuku> Games in the 90s never had checkpoints this generous
[1:45:42] <+PA_august> That Jaffe video is nuts, how are you a game dev who played games in the 80s/90s and not know how to Metroid
[1:45:42] <+TombstoneTTromboners> AAAAAA
[1:45:42] <KingJackel> @PanicSwytch Yes. It's useful to know when your doing a spin jump
[1:45:44] <%Monkeyweed21> BIIITCH
[1:45:45] <Calek> @McDerpus some nerd
[1:45:45] <+gustavozxd> none of the Metroid bosses I've ever seen are that tough, people say they are in fusion but... they were pretty easy there too
[1:45:47] <T_Sasquatch> That was shorter than expected
[1:45:47] <+LazyAss24Seven> in the drink!
[1:45:50] <markdreizehn> NO THE POWER UP!!!
[1:45:51] <SaltyAzteca> GIT YER ASS BACK HERE CORE

[1:45:55] <+TombstoneTTromboners> tried to change back into big x form to fly away and still fell in
[1:45:56] <$MinoMiushi> No ice beam for Pat
[1:45:57] <%criticalink_> I feel like I could enjoy a lot of the Dread bosses more if they didn't feel quite so trial-and-error. The fact they have to have checkpoints right outside the doors to them seems like a blatant acknowledgement the damage is a bit much.
[1:45:57] <%hereiam407> Good work!
[1:45:57] <ToneBacas> you're so cool, Samus
[1:45:58] <+Pachi3000> BAMF
[1:46:02] <+Delenay> how handy
[1:46:04] <%hereiam407> Drill baby drill
[1:46:05] <+ReiDuran> GOD I LOVE THE THRUSTERS ON HER BACK
[1:46:06] <TheAzureOracle> I think some people just have a really hard time with the idea of having to do more than one attempt at a boss
[1:46:09] <+mr_miyagucci> I wish I had thought of using y to cancel spinjump for spark, getting some of those collectables would have been much easier
[1:46:10] <saddlezilla1> This fight was so fun
[1:46:12] <hassanico2> that 3rd person view charge shot RULED
[1:46:12] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "fuck you controls"
[1:46:13] <%hewlettfan96> Good work!!!
[1:46:17] <+zuzuxiv> god she's so badass
[1:46:17] <+the22cstomp> god samus is so fucking cool
[1:46:18] <hassanico2> *casually shoots machine*
[1:46:19] <Halospaz117> You have successfully turned the warm AC back on
[1:46:20] <redwidow1358> David Jaffe got his panties in a twist because the ceiling had some unmarked shootable blocks that you are meant to shoot by complete accident. The game also has a plain text explanation that says if you hit a dead end you should shoot things. He's a real game designer by the way.
[1:46:23] <greatspaceadventure> @ToneBacas too cool for me not to be slightly terrified of you
[1:46:25] <jorniev> SHE SHOT THE FANS
[1:46:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> fuckin badass mofo
[1:46:28] <%Kiyosuki> Cause scrubs will always reach for excuses. It’s always been that way the only thing that’s changed are the platforms and excuses lol
[1:46:29] <+BoboDaHobo> @coffeecobra same! I'm on the last fight right now actually
[1:46:30] <KasiCrafter> Looks like she's not a...fan Kappa
[1:46:30] <+Zxtole> Yea casuals can't stand losing
[1:46:30] <%hewlettfan96> This fight was amazing from beginning to end
[1:46:31] <jorniev> CAUSE SHE HATED IT
[1:46:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt if you land the shinespark its an instant kill
[1:46:32] <pixelkenj> Samus wasnt a big fan of that attack
[1:46:36] <+Delenay> nope it was just a room
[1:46:36] <CoffeeCobra> I find no shame in googling a boss and reading up a gameplan tbh it lessened the frustration for me
[1:46:39] <%GalacticaPhanto> Suplex me Space Mommy holy shit
[1:46:39] <%SinnerEbru> fuck samus is so hot
[1:46:40] <PanicSwytch> @halospaz117 @kingjackel That would've made all those speed boost puzzlez easier for me. Thanks
[1:46:41] <%Deft_Thought> I wonder what the planet was like before they built this place?
[1:46:42] <%hereiam407> Samus, thank you for the refreshing AC and cold lemonade
[1:46:43] <+tsmasher1000> Samus is a queen in this game
[1:46:43] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Samus pulled a Sarah Conner 😆
[1:46:45] <jorniev> THAT WAS SO PETTY SAMUS
[1:46:45] <fcKurl> @criticalink_ I get that but i love it personally it's all about learning the boss patterns then executing and it feels great when you get it
[1:46:51] <CoffeeCobra> don't torture yourselves my dudes
[1:46:53] <%hewlettfan96> Sami’s was just not having It with that fight
[1:47:05] <%hewlettfan96> @sinnerebru BEGONE SIMP
[1:47:11] <@commanderclaw> Gimme the Xussy
[1:47:17] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt theres a teleporter here that will take you back to the screw attack room
[1:47:22] <+ReiDuran> Xussy
[1:47:30] <PanicSwytch> Xussy
[1:47:34] <+Namillus> Less cool games: "Bluh we don't know how to characterise a silent protagonist!" Metroid Dread: "Hold these E Tanks."
[1:47:35] <%SinnerEbru> @hewlettfan96 im a lesbian im allowed to simp over girls who'd kill me
[1:47:38] <KingJackel> @PanicSwytch No problem :) Before I learned the tirck, I needed to press R to get out of the spin. So much easier now.
[1:47:39] <+omegadarknes> @hewlettfan96 nothing wrong with finding samus hot, cuz she is
[1:47:41] <hassanico2> SA-Xussy Kappa
[1:47:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Whussy superior over sussy Xussy.
[1:47:43] <SunsetJack> Yeap, teleporter shortcut is close by.
[1:47:44] <KnivesEve> thanks Claw
[1:47:48] <%greasypete00> this fire doesnt hurt you now
[1:47:49] <CoffeeCobra> @BoboDaHobo You'll get it! it looks way harder than it is! Remember to take breaks tho, it helps to go into it with a calm mind SeemsGood
[1:47:50] <%RealThiele> fire . gif
[1:47:53] <%GalacticaPhanto> Metroiussy
[1:47:58] <Make_me_mad> Gravity suit is so good that fire doesn't even hurt you.
[1:48:04] <+attoram> fun fact fire traps can't hurt you anymore thanks to the grav suit
[1:48:05] <+gustavozxd> I had fun learning the bosses, wasn't frustrating at all to me
[1:48:05] <%scaryboisupreme> You're actually not affected by fire anymore
[1:48:05] <%hewlettfan96> @sinnerebru She isn’t real cmon don’t be weird
[1:48:06] <Saltmeisterr> theres a TP shorcut pat
[1:48:08] <%GalacticaPhanto> Wait. Metroidussy
[1:48:09] <+Havictos> Is it even possible for Jaffe to not be a giant pissbaby
[1:48:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Metrussy
[1:48:10] <%hereiam407> Lava doesn't hurt you
[1:48:10] <+youngjwilliams> not used to actually watching a stream live, how long does he usually go?
[1:48:11] <kinkade_77> space jump so cool
[1:48:12] <%Persona_EX> Mannnn so I just beat Dread. All I’m gonna say is best Metroid I’ve played
[1:48:24] <hassanico2> this route's fine too
[1:48:24] <+Delenay> blue tp

[1:48:26] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[1:48:31] <SunsetJack> Dark blue on the map
[1:48:31] <+TaurusOxford> there was a better teloport, past the elevator.
[1:48:33] <%RealThiele> this route is fine
[1:48:34] <KingJackel> Yes, in fact, you might need to take it to get the power up
[1:48:36] <+youngjwilliams> or hoof it for items
[1:48:36] <fierysnowflakes> psaDogchamp
[1:48:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dark blue thing
[1:48:38] <%zarkazeon> don't forget to merc purple emmi after this upgrade
[1:48:39] <Saltmeisterr> to the right of the elevator
[1:48:41] <%hewlettfan96> @omegadarknes If you find plastic oddly proportioned barbie dolls than I guess so yeah
[1:48:45] <Zaphire_Saucypants> need to go through lava to get to
[1:48:52] <zentzen> it doesnt matter
[1:48:52] <KingJackel> It's just to the right of the elevator you just took
[1:48:54] <greatspaceadventure> this game has top music
[1:48:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> @hewlettfan96 Naw let em simp free who cares
[1:48:58] <SunsetJack> You unlock the other way.

[1:49:13] <%RealThiele> da baby grandpa
[1:49:14] <+attoram> Fun thing I like is how they made at least a partial language for the Chozo
[1:49:19] <+attoram> it's nice
[1:49:19] <+omegadarknes> @hewlettfan96 i mean, zero suit doesn't look quite like a barbie doll
[1:49:23] <Ravingpyro> Elmo!

[1:49:45] <%notsoy> elmo the eternal

[1:49:46] <+LastHazzerd> eternal dog
[1:49:47] <@commanderclaw> I wish I could stay the same age 3 years in a row, you go Elmo

[1:49:57] <ArthurDoyleRPG> Loading Screens are the real Dread
[1:49:58] <%RealThiele> streetlife aged him 3 years
[1:50:00] <Blank9> I forget how old my cats are because I got them at 3 and 5 months old
[1:50:02] <T_Sasquatch> Can't age if you stop counting
[1:50:05] <%ScreamLord> Eternal geriatric Elmo
[1:50:05] <%hereiam407> Only 6 more to go
[1:50:08] <Halospaz117> Lava is now a hot tub
[1:50:08] <%twistedj3ster> look how strong you've become
[1:50:10] <+tempestzephyr> the tomato soup
[1:50:10] <kinkade_77> orange fanta
[1:50:10] <+TombstoneTTromboners> correct
[1:50:11] <CoffeeCobra> Samus too hot for lava Kreygasm
[1:50:11] <%hewlettfan96> @sinnerebru Hehe whatever just don’t do it all the time
[1:50:17] <+Havictos> Fuck Reality
[1:50:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> which means you can revisit all those lava areas.
[1:50:24] <%notsoy> EXPLODY BLOB
[1:50:25] <Halospaz117> @CoffeeCobra Always has been
[1:50:26] <%Piemono> he missed it
[1:50:27] <%Buzzard42> psaBlind
[1:50:27] <wqorst> I thought he saw it lol
[1:50:28] <%hewlettfan96> @omegadarknes She’s still just a game character though
[1:50:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> @hewlettfan96 Its healthy if it's just like you find the concept of a bad ass bitch hot but not obsessing over the fictional character I guess
[1:50:29] <+vaderxyz1970> Damn samus could of gotten the Ice beam off that boss then if lava wasnt a problem anymore
[1:50:33] <+rbakervv> scan pat
[1:50:34] <SunsetJack> There is an explosive blob next to it.
[1:50:36] <+Delenay> theres a wall blob there
[1:50:37] <%Monkeyweed21> psaBlind
[1:50:37] <Make_me_mad> I like that pat shot the roof instead of using the scanner,
[1:50:42] <%Deft_Thought> @greatspaceadventure Yeah, not a lot of the tracks land for me. A lot of em sound whimsical to my ear.
[1:50:43] <%criticalink_> @fcKurl They're great fights, I just think it'd be more gratifying if you weren't intended to die several times to learn it. That combined with the frequent checkpoints (instead of having to return to last Save) I feel Dread kinda lost the health-management aspect of the 2D Metroid games that added to the tension of the older titles. Though I get where you're coming from.
[1:50:45] <+Delenay> to hit with diffuser
[1:50:47] <%SinnerEbru> @hewlettfan96 SeemsGood i gotchu kindly internet fellow
[1:50:47] <+TombstoneTTromboners> hard mode rules

[1:50:55] <+zuzuxiv> oh

[1:51:01] <+omegadarknes> @hewlettfan96 yeah, she doesn't need to be real to look good
[1:51:03] <Halospaz117> I mean, can't Samus not use the ice bean anymore cuz of the Metroid DNA? Isn't that why she has Ice missles instead now?
[1:51:03] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> You can New Game from the same file
[1:51:05] <%DashXero> The Goblins, people.
[1:51:08] <SunsetJack> You can copy your file anyway.

[1:51:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ah.
[1:51:14] <DoctorMulholland> gobbo
[1:51:15] <+omegadarknes> @hewlettfan96 she only needs to be real to be interacted with
[1:51:15] <%Kiyosuki> Man gravity suit looks so nice in this game the white works with the red and purple so much better than yellow imo
[1:51:16] <%hewlettfan96> @sinnerebru Right back at ya psaUp
[1:51:17] <%AncelDeLambert> this game actually lets you copy saves between slots
[1:51:18] <%Maids4lyfe> no it doesn't
[1:51:20] <@goose_attack_almanac> He's out of line but he's right.
[1:51:20] <peyodogo> you can beat the goblins you can do it

[1:51:34] <+TheotherKristian> Mind Goblins at Work
[1:51:35] <+Namillus> @Halospaz117 That stopped being a problem after she absorbed the SA-X but there's probably design reasons to keep her with the Ice Missiles
[1:51:35] <Louie_Salmon> ???????
[1:51:35] <KingJackel> SCREW ATTACK
[1:51:36] <+zuzuxiv> LETS GOOOOOOO
[1:51:37] <%Maids4lyfe> your rewards will be deleted including hard mode @PatStaresAt

[1:52:31] <CoffeeCobra> you ever just JUMP into a person and they ragdoll to the floor?
[1:52:31] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt word of advice, screw attack FUCKS up enemies and even mini bosses
[1:52:33] <PanicSwytch> No need to shoot. screw attack melts enemies
[1:52:36] <Halospaz117> @Halospaz117 I mean she was still weak to cold in this game before she gets the gravity suit so I imagine the cold weakness just stays, and while the gravity suit protects from whats outside, having a constant cold energy inside would be a problem
[1:52:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Try it on the large ones, see what happens.
[1:52:39] <%Kiyosuki> Screw Attack means you’re at that point where Samus is basically a god
[1:52:45] <Calek> @hewlettfan96 became Easy Allies
[1:52:51] <Asuterisuku> A shame they got absorbed into Rooster Teeth
[1:52:54] <%AncelDeLambert> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:52:55] <+attoram> Special power you don't have yet
[1:52:55] <@GeneralSCPatton> You now dust everything with your flips

[1:53:13] <KingJackel> Burenia is the next place you'll want to be
[1:53:14] <+gustavozxd> no
[1:53:15] <%zarkazeon> ferenia my dude
[1:53:16] <liammichealryan> The only thing you're missing is the power bombs, you can basically get everything you want now.
[1:53:17] <Saltmeisterr> theres a green TP in burenia u can take
[1:53:20] <+Take_2_shots> @GalacticaPhanto no

[1:56:44] <SaltyAzteca> it does but it hurts you too
[1:56:44] <%AncelDeLambert> no it doesn't
[1:56:46] <%hereiam407> And maybe you too
[1:56:46] <%PhantomMiG> It does
[1:56:46] <%Deft_Thought> " So you got a 25 percent at best at beat me! And then you add Quiet Robe to the mix? You-the chances of winning drasticy go down. See, the 3-Way at ZDR, you got a 33 and a third chance of winning. But I! I got a 66 and two thirds chance of winning, Quiet Beak KNOOOWS he can't beat me, and he's not even gonna try."
[1:56:46] <+Take_2_shots> they're still hitboxes

[1:57:19] <CoffeeCobra> these guys gave me such a hard time at first
[1:57:23] <%hereiam407> For enemy types

[1:57:50] <+tempestzephyr> wall missle
[1:57:54] <%hereiam407> Stack on stacks
[1:57:57] <kinkade_77> storm missile op
[1:57:58] <%AncelDeLambert> oh hey shortcut location for the gravity suit
[1:57:59] <Treasure_Vault> +2 missiles might be one of the weaker parts of this game
[1:58:01] <SunsetJack> Oh boy
[1:58:03] <+gustavozxd> let's see pat do this one, this one is fun
[1:58:03] <Qsmash_> it never once occured to me to use Storm Missiles during my first run
[1:58:04] <%zarkazeon> oh no....
[1:58:05] <Saltmeisterr> OH MNA
[1:58:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ah yes
[1:58:07] <mm_orios> here we go
[1:58:08] <%AncelDeLambert> shinespaaaaaaark
[1:58:08] <KingJackel> This is the gravity suit skip area
[1:58:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this part
[1:58:17] <%AncelDeLambert> YEP
[1:58:22] <%valriot> Yeeee best puzzle time
[1:58:23] <SunsetJack> Yeap

[1:58:26] <pixelkenj> Yeah I saw it the other day
[1:58:27] <%valriot> Youll see
[1:58:28] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> If you can shinespark good
[1:58:29] <%AncelDeLambert> successfully do this shinespark
[1:58:31] <CoffeeCobra> I'm with Pat on this, HOW
[1:58:31] <%Buzzard42> that's the path for early gravity suit
[1:58:32] <%Deft_Thought> @SaltyAzteca I got 141 and 2/3rds chance of winning!
[1:58:32] <+TaurusOxford> Early grav suit area, to be clear
[1:58:32] <Asuterisuku> If you don't like shinesparking don't go down here
[1:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I did it myself today
[1:58:40] <SunsetJack> It skips 2 upgrades when you get ice missiles.
[1:58:40] <CoffeeCobra> OHHHH I remember now
[1:58:40] <+Take_2_shots> you don't need space jump only shine spark
[1:58:40] <+harrisboe> THIS FUCKER. THIS IS THE ONLY ITEM I STILL HAVENT GOTTEN
[1:58:42] <%Arkfyre> oh this one is cool
[1:58:43] <KingJackel> You need to do a chain of shine sparks.
[1:58:45] <@commanderclaw> Hoo boy, this area is some REAL SHIT
[1:58:46] <Halospaz117> oh THIS shinespark
[1:58:46] <livi242> oh boy

[1:58:52] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Yeah, not skip, early Gravity
[1:58:55] <redwidow1358> Today is the day Pat learns how to shinespark in midair into a ramp
[1:58:57] <%greasypete00> more fun times with speed
[1:58:57] <+gustavozxd> air dash doesn't exist
[1:58:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Remember the last stream?
[1:58:58] <%SaphronBlackbourne> You can skip Space Jump
[1:58:58] <CoffeeCobra> oh lord this bitch LUL
[1:58:59] <%AncelDeLambert> that's how
[1:59:00] <hairtoday> man fuck this puzzle
[1:59:02] <%R3Roundabout> this is the number 1 speed puzzle
[1:59:02] <KingJackel> If you shinespark into a sploe, instead of crashing, you will continue to run
[1:59:03] <%Kiyosuki> Watching speed runs of this game when runs are better refined is gonna be a trip
[1:59:04] <+ReiDuran> GOOD LUCK

[1:59:27] <SaltyAzteca> The very beginning!
[1:59:28] <+Take_2_shots> you have to mid air shine spark it's not the hardest because you can just grapple to the walls but it's still rough

[1:59:29] <%SaiyanShoto> This one is fun and hard
[1:59:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> up
[1:59:31] <SunsetJack> More back
[1:59:33] <+zuzuxiv> above
[1:59:33] <KingJackel> In the room you got the energy part
[1:59:35] <%ForlornCarton> You start where you ran to get down here
[1:59:35] <greatspaceadventure> this is one of the best ones in the game
[1:59:35] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt start in the room that you shinesparked in to get here
[1:59:35] <%scaryboisupreme> the room above this one
[1:59:38] <+TaurusOxford> Back at the spot where you broke the blocks
[1:59:38] <%MooseIsGoose> look up a video for this one
[1:59:38] <+zuzuxiv> where you last shine sparked
[1:59:39] <saddlezilla1> AHHHH ZERO MISSION FLASHBACKS
[1:59:39] <%cvp5127> git gud
[1:59:39] <%R3Roundabout> last room
[1:59:42] <+cermo55> up
[1:59:42] <Spudmeister9000> this is the only puzzle I had to look up a solution
[1:59:42] <%scaryboisupreme> the floor is just big enough
[1:59:43] <+attoram> In the room you got the energy tank just now
[1:59:43] <+gustavozxd> start where you last did the speed boost
[1:59:43] <+Take_2_shots> like 2 rooms back
[1:59:43] <heartlesshealer> this puzzle is cool, but also super bullshit
[1:59:44] <scarman125> wrong way
[1:59:45] <%vexion_smh> figure out and find out
[1:59:46] <%DashXero> The good news is that you're not far from where you have to start.
[1:59:47] <CoffeeCobra> this one is fun but kinda unforgiving
[1:59:47] <TheAzureOracle> You have to start outside, also remember that shinesparking into ramps recharges speed booster
[1:59:48] <SunsetJack> Close to where you picked up that E part.
[1:59:50] <+zuzuxiv> yes
[1:59:51] <%MegaXZerolegends> Shine spark up the slopes
[1:59:51] <+zuzuxiv> above
[1:59:51] <%cvp5127> lol no
[1:59:52] <@commanderclaw> Higher
[1:59:53] <+bugz_munny> nah further back
[1:59:53] <%AncelDeLambert> now go up
[1:59:53] <+Take_2_shots> one more up
[1:59:54] <%greasypete00> you have to make use of storing
[1:59:55] <+bugz_munny> up above
[1:59:56] <SaltyAzteca> Next door
[1:59:56] <SunsetJack> Yes
[1:59:56] <%ReenMan350> the other room
[1:59:57] <%SaiyanShoto> From the behind that top door
[1:59:57] <PanicSwytch> Up
[1:59:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> upper door
[2:00:00] <%scaryboisupreme> no the room above
[2:00:00] <+cermo55> up one
[2:00:01] <Make_me_mad> No, one floor up even.
[2:00:01] <+TaurusOxford> No, just above
[2:00:02] <+cermo55> ore
[2:00:02] <%maskofmichael> Start at the begining
[2:00:03] <%AncelDeLambert> the same shinespark as before
[2:00:03] <Spudmeister9000> the other door
[2:00:04] <scarman125> up
[2:00:04] <TheAzureOracle> No, further out
[2:00:04] <%DXLelouch24> @patstaresat this is the gravity suit sequence break
[2:00:06] <Dr_Angelic> You gotta start in the room above this one, but protip:  A+X in mid-air plus a direction triggers the shine dash
[2:00:06] <%RealThiele> get good
[2:00:07] <+bugz_munny> that room
[2:00:07] <+zuzuxiv> you start in this room yes
[2:00:07] <%AncelDeLambert> HERE
[2:00:07] <%cvp5127> right there
[2:00:07] <@commanderclaw> YES
[2:00:08] <+bugz_munny> yup
[2:00:09] <KingJackel> yes
[2:00:09] <zealsteele> Yes
[2:00:09] <%scaryboisupreme> yes
[2:00:10] <%ReenMan350> ye
[2:00:10] <%Arkfyre> yes
[2:00:10] <%watts121> THIS TOOK ME AN HOUR
[2:00:10] <CoffeeCobra> YUP
[2:00:11] <TheAzureOracle> There
[2:00:11] <Asuterisuku> Tis is the hardest spark in the game required for completion.
[2:00:11] <+TaurusOxford> Yes.
[2:00:12] <snivins> yes
[2:00:12] <PanicSwytch> there
[2:00:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yes
[2:00:13] <+cermo55> yes
[2:00:14] <+Take_2_shots> you have just enough room
[2:00:14] <%criticalink_> it's a stupid tight shinespark
[2:00:14] <redwidow1358> Here
[2:00:14] <+bugz_munny> right here
[2:00:14] <Dr_Angelic> yup at the edge
[2:00:14] <+gustavozxd> yea
[2:00:15] <%AncelDeLambert> have fun
[2:00:15] <%DashXero> This room.
[2:00:15] <%SaiyanShoto> yup
[2:00:15] <ZorenMaximus> yes
[2:00:16] <@GeneralSCPatton> Yup
[2:00:16] <SunsetJack> Yeap
[2:00:17] <Louie_Salmon> Yep
[2:00:18] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[2:00:20] <Kaji04> hahahahaha
[2:00:21] <%scaryboisupreme> you gotta be quick
[2:00:22] <+bugz_munny> its frame perfect
[2:00:23] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Ramp shinespark tech les go
[2:00:25] <+attoram> This things a gauntlet
[2:00:25] <+ReiDuran> @PatStaresAt you can shinespark in midair by hitting Y+B by the way
[2:00:26] <+Lammchen> This one sucks
[2:00:28] <heartlesshealer> hope you love bouncing around like an asshole
[2:00:29] <fcKurl> u got this boss
[2:00:29] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt This is where gamers become GODS.
[2:00:29] <+ReiDuran> You'll need it for this
[2:00:30] <Asuterisuku> Not to beat the game, to 100 it.
[2:00:32] <hairtoday> shining down and left onto that ramp will let you reset your charge
[2:00:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> damn
[2:00:33] <%cvp5127> git gud
[2:00:34] <+gustavozxd> it's not frame perfect but it's tight
[2:00:36] <+zuzuxiv> stock the charge at the lip of the platform as soon as you get out the room
[2:00:36] <+cermo55> this one is really obtuse
[2:00:37] <Saltmeisterr> gotta store it
[2:00:38] <+Pachi3000> it's fast
[2:00:39] <Aeroallways> glhf
[2:00:40] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Chat remind me, did Woolie get this one?
[2:00:41] <+Take_2_shots> when you spark boost hit down as fast as you can
[2:00:42] <CoffeeCobra> it's doable but you're gonna be frustrated
[2:00:43] <SunsetJack> Press down to conserve shinespark.
[2:00:45] <Dr_Angelic> it's TIGHT
[2:00:45] <Louie_Salmon> Exactly enough room and no extra
[2:00:46] <hakumaribo> is this mandatory?
[2:00:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> BECOME AS GODS
[2:00:46] <%SaphronBlackbourne> This shinespark was a motherfucker, took me ages to pull off
[2:00:46] <Kaji04> it's not frame perfect, but it's annoyingly precise
[2:00:48] <+monfo_the_great> You have enough space to run and store where you're trying right now
[2:00:48] <%GuilKato> what is pat trying to do?
[2:00:48] <fierysnowflakes> His face is just stuck in utter confusion LUL
[2:00:52] <scarman125> and that's the easy part
[2:00:53] <+bugz_munny> tight af
[2:00:54] <PanicSwytch> If u shinespark towards the slope, the speed boost continues
[2:00:54] <zealsteele> @ReiDuran HAPPY BIRTHDAY REI DURAN
[2:00:54] <@GeneralSCPatton> This one wasn't too bad
[2:00:57] <+clevernamewhere> oh god
[2:00:57] <+TaurusOxford> @hakumaribo no.
[2:00:57] <+cermo55> store it before falling
[2:00:58] <+attoram> This is a lot of shine sparking into ramps, good luck
[2:00:59] <Explodincatz> welcome to Metroid
[2:01:00] <bobdoletrasher> @patstaresat dash into a slope to resume boost running and then hit dowm again to resave ot5
[2:01:01] <BlackermanZX> you can hang from the right and have a little more space iirc
[2:01:02] <Louie_Salmon> This would be way easier with a D-pad, unfortunately
[2:01:02] <teefpal> How far in is pat?
[2:01:03] <+Lammchen> You essentially gotta conserve shinespark a total of 3 times during this section
[2:01:04] <@commanderclaw> Prepare to be here for 45 minutes
[2:01:04] <bobdoletrasher> it
[2:01:05] <%bevyrage> you can get an easier start further up, but then you have to do more charges to store it
[2:01:07] <%criticalink_> I'm pretty sure the doors cause some sort of input delay
[2:01:07] <Ravingpyro> can u run back and forth to charge it
[2:01:12] <%SinnerEbru> @canadiananimatorguy yeah, im pretty sure he beat it on stream
[2:01:15] <%R3Roundabout> store shine, drop, slide, shoot down, shine left, slide, store shine, space jump, shine
[2:01:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> BECOME AS
[2:01:16] <CoffeeCobra> You can do it Pat PogChamp
[2:01:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> GODS
[2:01:19] <+ReiDuran> @ReiDuran NO NO NO
[2:01:20] <fcKurl> nope @Ravingpyro
[2:01:20] <+bugz_munny> This one hurt my thumb lol
[2:01:24] <%vaporousTippler> I guess it's better than shinesparking into a sock.
[2:01:25] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i just realized how to shinespark more directions the end of my hard mode playthrough lmao
[2:01:27] <Halospaz117> @commanderclaw You have to much confidence in pat my friend
[2:01:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's why I firmly press and hold before tilting the direction
[2:01:28] <+Take_2_shots> you need to slide into the next room and then shoot down before you unlease the spark
[2:01:29] <SunsetJack> Yea, it is hard.
[2:01:34] <+TombstoneTTromboners> i always just thought it was upwards
[2:01:37] <+TaurusOxford> down pat. LUL
[2:01:37] <+gustavozxd> the hardest part for me in this one was to figure out how, after that, just a couple attempts
[2:01:38] <%RonaldMcDownload> Just watched another streamer go at this for 20 minutes, lol
[2:01:40] <KingJackel> You need to be at the very edge
[2:01:43] <+bugz_munny> its rough man
[2:01:44] <PanicSwytch> This one took me about 15 mins
[2:01:46] <+youngjwilliams> start from hanging
[2:01:49] <+harrisboe> Hardest item to get in the game
[2:01:51] <%hereiam407> I have to go to the bathroom anyway
[2:01:53] <%R3Roundabout> slide there
[2:01:54] <+bugz_munny> slide
[2:01:54] <ZorenMaximus> slide?
[2:01:57] <+bugz_munny> shoot
[2:01:59] <%greasypete00> mid air shine
[2:01:59] <%hereiam407> Slide
[2:02:00] <%criticalink_> you can shinespark diagonally down-left once you reach the destructable blocks
[2:02:00] <SaltyAzteca> FRAME. PERFECT.
[2:02:01] <SunsetJack> Slide
[2:02:01] <+Pachi3000> no
[2:02:02] <@commanderclaw> Roll through, blast the blocks, hit the ramp
[2:02:04] <Make_me_mad> Slide under, shoot down, shinespark into the ramp behind you.
[2:02:05] <pixelkenj> go ahead, plan out the route
[2:02:05] <+TaurusOxford> you have to fall down and mid-air spark into the slope.
[2:02:06] <%R3Roundabout> yes
[2:02:06] <+eddie_hedgehog> it begins
[2:02:07] <jett_eyes> go against the slope pat
[2:02:07] <Syrushmx> Pat
[2:02:07] <+gustavozxd> yes
[2:02:07] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[2:02:08] <redwidow1358> Slide then spark in the air
[2:02:08] <%greasypete00> yes
[2:02:08] <+ReiDuran> midair shine
[2:02:08] <+bugz_munny> YEP
[2:02:08] <+Take_2_shots> you have to slide and shoot down before you lease the spark
[2:02:08] <+HakureiIllusion> Yes
[2:02:09] <Zaphire_Saucypants> What helped for me, with the shooting bit, was, without aiming with L, I constnatly shot as diagonally as I could. Then midair shinespark
[2:02:09] <$MinoMiushi> Slide then shinespark down left
[2:02:09] <snivins> yes
[2:02:09] <Spudmeister9000> YEP
[2:02:10] <@GeneralSCPatton> Slide, shoot floor, shine into slope
[2:02:10] <SaltyAzteca> Yep
[2:02:11] <hydragoon513> Yep
[2:02:11] <CoffeeCobra> you can slide and roll with the speed/shinespark stored
[2:02:11] <+TombstoneTTromboners> gotta go fast
[2:02:11] <%Horosho> ya
[2:02:12] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:02:12] <KingJackel> You gotta slide, shot down, then hit the slope, yes
[2:02:12] <%Buzzard42> yes
[2:02:12] <+gustavozxd> exactly that
[2:02:12] <+TombstoneTTromboners> goddamn
[2:02:12] <%tank7013> Yes
[2:02:12] <+cermo55> yes
[2:02:12] <TioXyco> yeah
[2:02:12] <PanicSwytch> YES
[2:02:12] <SunsetJack> Yeap
[2:02:13] <scarman125> yes
[2:02:13] <+youngjwilliams> yes
[2:02:13] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> slide, shoot down, shinespark midair
[2:02:13] <+monfo_the_great> Slide, shoot, jump, shine
[2:02:14] <roboyuji> I just gave up on these, I didn't find them fun at all.
[2:02:14] <%hereiam407> Yep
[2:02:14] <$MinoMiushi> You don't need to shoot
[2:02:14] <+Pachi3000> get down to the ramp and then release it
[2:02:14] <+bugz_munny> then slide
[2:02:14] <Explodincatz> correct
[2:02:14] <%ForlornCarton> Yes :D
[2:02:15] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[2:02:15] <%zarkazeon> the shittiest part is that it's just m8ssles
[2:02:15] <+attoram> yup
[2:02:16] <%DashXero> That's part of it, yes.
[2:02:16] <TheAzureOracle> You have to shinespark into the ramp, that gives you speed boost back
[2:02:18] <Blank9> can land on the blocks and diagonal down left through them
[2:02:18] <+bugz_munny> yup
[2:02:19] <+zuzuxiv> yes you do
[2:02:19] <%Horosho> ye
[2:02:19] <+bromeme> yup
[2:02:19] <+gustavozxd> you got plenty
[2:02:19] <Make_me_mad> Barely!
[2:02:19] <@commanderclaw> Barely
[2:02:20] <+Take_2_shots> Just barely
[2:02:20] <+TaurusOxford> Yes
[2:02:20] <%criticalink_> just barely
[2:02:20] <%ForlornCarton> Yes
[2:02:20] <hairtoday> you can spark through the blocks to the ramp
[2:02:21] <KingJackel> yes
[2:02:21] <%greasypete00> yes also
[2:02:22] <Spudmeister9000> just about
[2:02:22] <%tank7013> Yea
[2:02:22] <Aeroallways> If you shinespark into a ramp you go back into speedboost mode
[2:02:22] <zealsteele> @ReiDuran It's Nondell
[2:02:23] <miucsa51> Here we go
[2:02:23] <$MinoMiushi> You dom't need to shoot
[2:02:23] <+bugz_munny> Store mid-way
[2:02:23] <SunsetJack> Yes
[2:02:23] <teefpal> no
[2:02:23] <+monfo_the_great> Yes
[2:02:23] <%Arkfyre> just enough time
[2:02:24] <%hereiam407> Yes
[2:02:25] <scarman125> just barely
[2:02:26] <SaltyAzteca> GOOD LUCK PAT!
[2:02:26] <%Buzzard42> barely
[2:02:27] <%bevyrage> you can store it again before you roll
[2:02:27] <+cermo55> barely
[2:02:27] <CoffeeCobra> no shootie just slidie
[2:02:27] <+Pachi3000> barely
[2:02:29] <+Lammchen> I highly recommend you scout out the whole path to see what you're gonna need to do before attempting
[2:02:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> just do thing
[2:02:29] <+attoram> yes but just barely
[2:02:32] <Syrushmx> no, tell him he can start from the next room
[2:02:33] <%AncelDeLambert> you gotta do it again right after that one, too
[2:02:33] <$MinoMiushi> Slide then shinespark down left into the slope
[2:02:39] <PanicSwytch> SHINESPARK THE SLOPE FOR THE SPEED BOOST TO EXTEND
[2:02:39] <%SaiyanShoto> slide then shinespark above the blocks
[2:02:41] <+OneGorillionDollars> barley
[2:02:43] <%criticalink_> honestly it's getting the shinespark stored that's the hardest part of this puzzle
[2:02:44] <+T4silly> just got in and OH THIS ONE...
[2:02:47] <+esseston> uses the screw attack then shift to the left
[2:02:48] <TheAzureOracle> Also all of that is only the first part lol
[2:02:48] <CoffeeCobra> your speed should break a couple blocks if I remember correctly
[2:02:49] <An_Armed_Bear> Imagine showing this one to Jaffe
[2:02:50] <redwidow1358> You have just enough time to store the spark, slide, shoot down, then launch yourself in the sir
[2:02:51] <Syrushmx> after get up the 1st slide
[2:02:52] <+zuzuxiv> LOL
[2:02:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gonna have to do it midair too
[2:02:52] <redwidow1358> air*
[2:02:53] <%criticalink_> I failed starting the run like 75% of the attempts
[2:02:58] <+LazyAss24Seven> E D G E
[2:02:59] <%AncelDeLambert> this is not the hardest part
[2:03:02] <+esseston> you don't need shine spark
[2:03:02] <+ReiDuran> @ReiDuran oh hi
[2:03:03] <+HakureiIllusion> Climb up from the ledge, should give you as much space as possible
[2:03:04] <pixelkenj> I heard if you start boosting while you make a 180 you get more speed
[2:03:05] <kinkade_77> made me want to eat my fingers
[2:03:07] <hairtoday> that door is actually a problem for this puzzle
[2:03:08] <@commanderclaw> IMO this is only the Second Hardest shinespark puzzle
[2:03:10] <%tank7013> Honestly probably. It's tight for sure
[2:03:10] <greatspaceadventure> it's not too hard, it's about doing the  right inputs but the timing is generous
[2:03:11] <+bugz_munny> Its really tight
[2:03:11] <+rorschachsjournal505> Oh this one is awesome
[2:03:14] <%bevyrage> definitely not the hardest part to this one
[2:03:16] <+bugz_munny> Really reallly tight
[2:03:18] <%Dante_Magnum> this one was insano hard for me
[2:03:20] <+TombstoneTTromboners> OH NOOO
[2:03:21] <+TaurusOxford> This isn't mandatory Pat, just FYI
[2:03:22] <%PrimalDweeb> Why do dis?
[2:03:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[2:03:23] <+Take_2_shots> I wouldn't say it's the hardest park the hardest park is the first spark
[2:03:25] <%vexion_smh> awww almost
[2:03:26] <Halospaz117> Hey, that's progress
[2:03:26] <+cermo55> shoot down
[2:03:27] <SaltyAzteca> He's getting it
[2:03:28] <BlackermanZX> running back and forth works too
[2:03:29] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta shoot on the way
[2:03:29] <Blank9> almost, diagonal down left woulda done it
[2:03:30] <+Pachi3000> NotLikeThis
[2:03:31] <greatspaceadventure> i member doin this one
[2:03:33] <+gustavozxd> that is so weird, I got the run start easily but had trouble timing the EMMI parry LUL
[2:03:33] <%criticalink_> you shinesparked at the right point, you just have to do it down-left
[2:03:35] <+bugz_munny> this one is proly the hardest
[2:03:36] <miucsa51> NotLikeThis
[2:03:39] <%SinnerEbru> @taurusoxford but the goblin!
[2:03:42] <%Kiyosuki> Ryouma Nagare could do it Kappa
[2:03:47] <+Rekinsinn> i feel like having the door in the way of the initial part is just a bit of a fuck you to the player
[2:03:48] <fcKurl> nice
[2:03:48] <+zuzuxiv> YEAHYEAHYEAH LETS GO
[2:03:48] <scarman125> yeah this is optional. I only did it for the 100%
[2:03:48] <Halospaz117> I'll say, this still gave me less trouble than that last spark in Zero Mission
[2:03:49] <%notsoy> pat's mind goblins won't let him back down from a challenge psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:03:50] <+bugz_munny> STORE
[2:03:50] <%trackles_64> not done yet?
[2:03:54] <%ForlornCarton> Yeah!
[2:03:55] <Spudmeister9000> nope
[2:03:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh wow, I didn't even think to do that..
[2:03:55] <+Pachi3000> lol
[2:03:56] <+bugz_munny> Remember to store!!!
[2:03:58] <%AncelDeLambert> STORE then drop
[2:03:59] <%blastyoboots> STORE
[2:03:59] <Spudmeister9000> store after slide
[2:04:02] <Saltmeisterr> STORE
[2:04:03] <+youngjwilliams> he already has the item yes??
[2:04:03] <@commanderclaw> Remember to store it before the drop
[2:04:05] <%Arkfyre> store the charge ast the top of the second ramp
[2:04:05] <+HakureiIllusion> Don't forget to store before dropping
[2:04:05] <scarman125> remember to STORE
[2:04:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> diagonal shit always gets me.
[2:04:06] <KingJackel> You got this Pat!
[2:04:07] <%bevyrage> store it before each drop
[2:04:07] <+Pachi3000> slide STORE drop
[2:04:10] <Aeroallways> You have to store it again
[2:04:10] <%AncelDeLambert> you'd be surprised
[2:04:11] <CoffeeCobra> Good luck Pat, I gotta go to bed LUL
[2:04:11] <+Take_2_shots> yeah you have to do it 3 times

[2:04:27] <+TombstoneTTromboners> AAAA
[2:04:28] <+HakureiIllusion> This game really is a fighting game. Lab everything out, then when it comes time to execute, forget everything
[2:04:30] <%vexion_smh> This is like that fusion easter egg
[2:04:35] <SaltyAzteca> Store after sliding
[2:04:36] <+TaurusOxford> Store before the slide
[2:04:37] <Visorak6> Gotta store
[2:04:37] <An_Armed_Bear> He is beginning to believe
[2:04:38] <TheAzureOracle> Gotta store before the drop
[2:04:39] <+megaman_sentinel> store
[2:04:39] <PanicSwytch> Now u got the idea
[2:04:40] <@GeneralSCPatton> Almost there though
[2:04:40] <+Pachi3000> gotta store
[2:04:46] <Asuterisuku> Missed the store.

[2:05:25] <+Pachi3000> gamerrrrr
[2:05:25] <%MugenSandan> GREAT SUCCESS
[2:05:30] <%valriot> So this is where you get the Grav suit early
[2:05:30] <+TombstoneTTromboners> oh damn it's a shortcut
[2:05:35] <Akumaou> :D elnachangKoshifuri
[2:05:36] <zealsteele> GRAVITY SUIT SKIP
[2:05:37] <%AncelDeLambert> and this is how you early get the gravity
[2:05:40] <crash400> OMG PAT! YOUR D*VK IS SO BIG
[2:05:42] <doggieo> SKILL
[2:05:42] <+Take_2_shots> with that you can bypass the space jump sequence earlier
[2:05:42] <%AncelDeLambert> yep
[2:05:42] <%MechArch> girls were watching
[2:05:43] <@commanderclaw> Yep
[2:05:43] <%ForlornCarton> Early Gravity Suit
[2:05:44] <zealsteele> Yes
[2:05:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yep!
[2:05:45] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Grav suit shortcut
[2:05:45] <+the_hidden_yeti> yes
[2:05:46] <+TaurusOxford> this leads you to early grav
[2:05:46] <+youngjwilliams> yes
[2:05:46] <scarman125> this is the gravity suit skip
[2:05:46] <%tank7013> Yea
[2:05:48] <+Pachi3000> just space jump into em
[2:05:49] <Blank9> yeah
[2:05:49] <kinkade_77> yea
[2:05:50] <BlackermanZX> yes
[2:05:50] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[2:05:51] <$MinoMiushi> Yes
[2:05:54] <teefpal> Has he beaten the game?
[2:05:54] <KingJackel> This skip allows you to skip the 2nd visit to Ferenia, and the underwater section
[2:05:55] <%hereiam407> Thats awesome
[2:05:56] <SaltyAzteca> COMMIT
[2:05:57] <+zuzuxiv> rest in pepperoni
[2:05:57] <miucsa51> yes
[2:05:58] <ZorenMaximus> yes
[2:06:03] <An_Armed_Bear> not that far
[2:06:08] <%InternetShis> MUST COMMIT
[2:06:09] <%PrimalDweeb> Pat is biggest dickkus
[2:06:12] <%SinnerEbru> he go up
[2:06:28] <%greasypete00> pat you dont even need to shoot regular enemies now
[2:06:30] <+zuzuxiv> yeah that's probably the hardest one
[2:06:33] <@commanderclaw> Second hardest IMO
[2:06:33] <+bromeme> It's super sick tho
[2:06:33] <+fetrigon> what a great game
[2:06:35] <Kaji04> Does he know he can screwattack every non boss monster?
[2:06:40] <Halospaz117> Not sure if it's THE hardest, but it's up there
[2:06:42] <TheAzureOracle> I wouldn't say that's the hardest
[2:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the one in the containment unit might be harder
[2:06:45] <+T4silly> Oh that is for sure NOT the hardest one.
[2:06:45] <Make_me_mad> I wish you could re-fight bosses in this game.
[2:06:46] <+Take_2_shots> it's either that or the Super Missile skip
[2:06:46] <Spudmeister9000> I think theres a harder one
[2:06:50] <+bromeme> There's a ballspark one that's about as hard
[2:06:52] <%AncelDeLambert> or the temple, whatever that area is
[2:06:53] <%valriot> Its one of the hardest. depending on how you do another one
[2:06:53] <%tank7013> The hardest one is definitely the alt way for the Dairon one
[2:06:54] <+youngjwilliams> think you're gonna stream a hard mode run or just do it for yourself?
[2:06:58] <scarman125> @PatStaresAt screw attack one shots all non boss enemies
[2:06:59] <+gustavozxd> hardest one for me was the one at the entrance of the place with the statues
[2:07:00] <Spudmeister9000> that one is just tricky because the game doesnt teach you that mechanic
[2:07:07] <%AncelDeLambert> that morphspark one is NUTS
[2:07:08] <An_Armed_Bear> @Make_me_mad Can make a save before them i guess
[2:07:09] <%hereiam407> Cat nip
[2:07:10] <%VyperVic> i'm doing that puzzle rn lol
[2:07:10] <%SinnerEbru> smacksmacksmack
[2:07:11] <Saltmeisterr> Early super missle is a fun one
[2:07:11] <KingJackel> In order to get to the GS skip, you also need to do a shine spark to get to this teleportal in Ghavoran early.
[2:07:13] <+megaman_sentinel> dat power stance tho
[2:07:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Try screw attacking regular non-boss enemies.
[2:07:14] <olaksi> you can screw almost everything
[2:07:16] <Saltmeisterr> and it looks so cool
[2:07:20] <teefpal> Can't wait for the final area
[2:07:23] <+Namillus> There's a room that has two entrances, both of which can only be unlocked from inside the room
[2:07:29] <saddlezilla1> Anyone remember the ZM shinespark puzzles? the missle in Ridley one and the trip wire? LUL
[2:07:30] <+Namillus> That's pretty spicy
[2:07:32] <%valriot> LUL
[2:07:33] <pixelkenj> :)
[2:07:34] <+bugz_munny> Timestop
[2:07:34] <%R3Roundabout> need upgrade
[2:07:38] <%AncelDeLambert> does he have the cross yet?
[2:07:39] <+TaurusOxford> need another upgrade
[2:07:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> take a guess
[2:07:41] <+tsmasher1000> LUL
[2:07:42] <%AncelDeLambert> that's a no
[2:07:43] <$MinoMiushi> Timestop
[2:07:43] <%scaryboisupreme> there's 2 ways to do this
[2:07:43] <+ReiDuran> timestop
[2:07:44] <TheAzureOracle> You're missing a thing
[2:07:44] <Blank9> can get your balls sparking
[2:07:44] <teefpal> You get a powerup
[2:07:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Time stop, my man
[2:07:48] <scarman125> cross bombs
[2:07:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can actually shinespark this
[2:07:50] <pixelkenj> Need the Scrimblo Bimblo Upgrade
[2:07:52] <notabrobro> he doesn't have cross?
[2:07:54] <%scaryboisupreme> You can shinespark it or go for another upgrade
[2:07:56] <+bromeme> @saddlezilla1 god don't remind me it still haunts me
[2:07:57] <+LastHazzerd> timestop is good code
[2:07:58] <%hereiam407> Mega cool
[2:08:07] <Asuterisuku> He has the cross, I think?
[2:08:09] <+bugz_munny> I love it
[2:08:17] <+TaurusOxford> He doesn't
[2:08:21] <KingJackel> You get the cross next
[2:08:21] <Saltmeisterr> @Asuterisuku not yet
[2:08:22] <+youngjwilliams> no cross
[2:08:23] <%valriot> Ballsparking up there is also a skip
[2:08:23] <TheAzureOracle> I don't think he does
[2:08:24] <$MinoMiushi> He's about to get the time stop
[2:08:30] <SaltyAzteca> Grape bubble gum Samus
[2:08:30] <%trackles_64> Zero suit is sexy tho
[2:08:30] <%hereiam407> Its a nice purple
[2:08:31] <Blank9> the white helps
[2:08:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> very Unit 4
[2:08:32] <+zuzuxiv> this is imo the best gravity suit
[2:08:34] <Halospaz117> Samus Returns Gravity Suit is may favorite version, but this one's good too
[2:08:36] <%Ipsenscastle> I'm not a huge fan of the purple with red
[2:08:37] <+TombstoneTTromboners> the varia suit is definitely my favorite
[2:08:41] <SaltyAzteca> Boss door
[2:08:42] <+youngjwilliams> i dont like the torso lights tho
[2:08:42] <+bugz_munny> I like the neon zigzags
[2:08:43] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I prefer blue lights on the Gravirty Suit
[2:08:43] <%hereiam407> They all look great
[2:08:43] <+tsmasher1000> Samus is sicko
[2:08:45] <+Take_2_shots> yup
[2:08:45] <Halospaz117> But honestly I love the gravity suit in general
[2:08:48] <+bromeme> KEKW
[2:08:48] <+TombstoneTTromboners> SHINESPARK TIME
[2:08:48] <+gustavozxd> that one is easy
[2:08:49] <%hereiam407> Varia is my default favorite
[2:08:49] <+tsmasher1000> LUL
[2:08:51] <teefpal> Chill pat
[2:08:52] <+Havictos> It's a cool iridescent purple
[2:08:52] <Zezuar> SPINE SHARKS
[2:08:52] <saddlezilla1> @bromeme I actually love most of ZM's crazy puzzles. But that missle speed puzzle can burn in hell NotLikeThis
[2:08:55] <$Jaxnos> those are all a color theory thingie
[2:08:56] <%polothegreatest> sick, rocking woolie style samus psaDab
[2:08:57] <+T4silly> That one's easier than you think.
[2:08:59] <+zuzuxiv> ngl tho someone ruined the suit design for me describing samus as a 'nike shoe'
[2:09:03] <+tsmasher1000> Pog
[2:09:04] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah Gravity always being the big power suit isn't my favorite
[2:09:05] <+Namillus> My favourite part about Samus's suit in this game is how its lore interfaces with getting upgrades
[2:09:07] <+bugz_munny> yee
[2:09:07] <%hereiam407> That was aweome
[2:09:10] <fierysnowflakes> E
[2:09:10] <%Kiyosuki> Yeah like I said earlier the white red purple works so much better than yellow red purple imo
[2:09:13] <%RealThiele> E
[2:09:13] <%trackles_64> thats not purpl its blue
[2:09:14] <+fetrigon> ye
[2:09:18] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat is the Metroid now
[2:09:19] <%InternetShis> E
[2:09:21] <+bromeme> @saddlezilla1 that space jump before mecha ridley is a nightmare too
[2:09:24] <+bugz_munny> bad ass bitch
[2:09:27] <BoneofMalkav> E: It's in the E
[2:09:28] <+TaurusOxford> @trackles_64 Don't do this, please.
[2:09:28] <%ScreamLord> That's because Samus is
[2:09:29] <teefpal> Thats because you are
[2:09:31] <KingJackel> You can also get the next upgrade you are about to get early with a well timed ball spark.
[2:09:31] <+fetrigon> E
[2:09:32] <+Pachi3000> supabitch
[2:09:35] <ZorenMaximus> LUL
[2:09:35] <%SaiyanShoto> looking cool Pat
[2:09:37] <Blank9> I do like that gravity added the extra bits to the shoulder compared to the other versions
[2:09:37] <Halospaz117> Who the FUCK said it's blue?
[2:09:38] <Ravingpyro> E
[2:09:39] <teefpal> E
[2:09:39] <+HakureiIllusion> The Woolie suit
[2:09:41] <+Namillus> Lore-wise the power suit is rebuilding itself after Fusion, hence the clean white plates, and each suit upgrade you get adds additional armour in the suit colour
[2:09:45] <Halospaz117> RAISE YOUR FUCKIN HAND
[2:09:46] <An_Armed_Bear> Light and Phazon are sweet though
[2:09:46] <%hereiam407> Its purple
[2:09:47] <hassanico2> oh god
[2:09:50] <hassanico2> This thing
[2:09:53] <%InternetShis> Girlboss Samus
[2:09:54] <%AncelDeLambert> here we gooooo
[2:09:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you can just screw attack the first two parts
[2:09:59] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Magenta more than a anything
[2:10:00] <greatspaceadventure> i got this item before i got space jump, it was my one sequence break
[2:10:06] <PanicSwytch> This fucked me up
[2:10:07] <akitanito> rocket that ass
[2:10:07] <%RealThiele> beeg
[2:10:07] <saddlezilla1> @bromeme I think the intent for that one is a shinespark, it's hell either way tho...
[2:10:07] <%AncelDeLambert> just jump and flash, super fast
[2:10:08] <%InternetShis> WAOW
[2:10:09] <SaltyAzteca> This place looks like SR388
[2:10:11] <%Deft_Thought> Boy big
[2:10:11] <%hereiam407> Beast wars time
[2:10:12] <hassanico2> BIGGEST
[2:10:15] <%AncelDeLambert> and now a biggerrererer one
[2:10:16] <%Deft_Thought> BOY BIG
[2:10:16] <+dante_must_die_exe> oh NO
[2:10:16] <+TombstoneTTromboners> AN EVER BIGGER ONE
[2:10:17] <Finaldragoon> ANOTHA ONE
[2:10:17] <KingJackel> Biggerer one
[2:10:18] <fierysnowflakes> BIGGEST ONE
[2:10:18] <+D00msDayDan> hardest boss in the game
[2:10:20] <+Pachi3000> now once more
[2:10:21] <%ScreamLord> Even biggerer
[2:10:21] <%SinnerEbru> big boye
[2:10:23] <+tempestzephyr> time to die
[2:10:36] <Halospaz117> Oh this bitch
[2:10:39] <+gustavozxd> @d00msdaydan atpRtsuspectd
[2:10:41] <An_Armed_Bear> It's a pokemon
[2:10:42] <%Kiyosuki> I really want a hypothetical future smash brothers to design Samus more around this gameplay as opposed to how plodding she is in it now
[2:10:45] <+Ironbuttz> that does 3 energy tanks worth?!
[2:10:46] <hassanico2> Woolie decided the clear solution here was to SPACE JUMP over this guy every single time
[2:10:46] <+T4silly> Fire *while* sliding under for cool points
[2:10:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I think the regular missile might actually do more dps in this case
[2:10:50] <Asuterisuku> This isa boss, by the way
[2:10:51] <Halospaz117> I don't even remember how I beat this one, I think I just BS'd it
[2:11:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> or Flash Step.
[2:11:02] <+itsOnyxLeo> lmao I didn;t know you could slide under these boys, I always space jumped over him
[2:11:04] <%InternetShis> Back the dumpy up
[2:11:07] <%hereiam407> I love that Mini-bosses just show up, with no cutscenes
[2:11:08] <%Deft_Thought> Whoa, never saw that
[2:11:08] <+itsOnyxLeo> that made this so much easier
[2:11:08] <hassanico2> LUL
[2:11:09] <olaksi> killed by butt
[2:11:09] <%Ipsenscastle> killed by butt
[2:11:09] <wqorst> ass death

[2:13:45] <+youngjwilliams> this is the strangest upgrade
[2:13:46] <%hereiam407> @Kiyosuki We Metroid now?
[2:13:47] <Make_me_mad> @NigelSchnauzerpug They can't infect metroids. Metroids eat them on contact.
[2:13:52] <PanicSwytch> It also helps propel u forward in morph ball form
[2:13:54] <scarman125> immediately forgets about the cross bomb
[2:13:58] <Halospaz117> Pat you're just using the regular bombs
[2:13:59] <SaltyAzteca> Its not cheating if its part of the game

[2:17:04] <%InternetShis> Hi Adum
[2:17:05] <marvel877> Did he ever figure out shinesparking into ramps or is he still confused?
[2:17:07] <$realm_forge> That’s what Hollywood seems to believe
[2:17:13] <Asuterisuku> Woolie skipped this vidit
[2:17:14] <+bugz_munny> Gotta murder
[2:17:16] <%hereiam407> We gotta help Adum
[2:17:23] <fcKurl> @marvel877 he just did it earlier :)

[2:17:25] <teefpal> The raven beaks a real tough guy huh?
[2:17:25] <%hereiam407> Poor horse computer
[2:17:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> God, he's sooooo great
[2:17:29] <+gustavozxd> @marvel877 he got it a couple minutes ago on a puzzle
[2:17:32] <+Rekinsinn> @marvel877 he got the one that leads to early gravity suit, he's good on it
[2:17:34] <%Persona_EX> I would say there is a “victory road” of some sorts
[2:17:35] <Treasure_Vault> Welp uhh go do stuff

[2:17:51] <An_Armed_Bear> Purple door hmmm
[2:17:51] <fcKurl> cross bombs are so cool
[2:17:52] <%greasypete00> screw attack is insane for everything but bosses basically
[2:17:53] <mattdemotts> on earth, actors would love to get an "emmy"... says a lot about the state of Outer Space
[2:18:04] <+Pachi3000> Raven Beak is the Wrestlemania sign
[2:18:09] <+tsmasher1000> Adam be like, Raven Beak's dick is so big. I'd like to worship it. I've heard he gets all the big booty bitches out there Samus. You probably shouldn't fight him because he'll totally wipe the floor with you again Kappa
[2:18:13] <+Pachi3000> "yo he coming tho"
[2:18:19] <Blu_C> Samus, I have been studying this Raven Beak guy and he is super cool and sexy and a billion times more awesome than you. Giving up sounds like a good idea.
[2:18:31] <+bugz_munny> Samus his ass cheeks are thunderously clapping
[2:18:33] <%solracc25> 225 missiles
[2:18:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Yeah, screw attack, you can basically just jump through an entire area lickety split, wrecking face all the while.
[2:18:35] <Calek> I bet Raven Beak has an 8 pack
[2:18:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> POWER
[2:18:38] <+bugz_munny> My processors can't handle it
[2:18:44] <%solracc25> Sonic
[2:18:47] <redwidow1358> @mattdemotts Funny thing about Dread, the files say "emmy" instead, as if it's a feminine name instead of the acronym

[2:19:27] <Calek> @redwidow1358 Quiet Robe says each letter individually funny enough

[2:20:20] <%twistedj3ster> or a grami at least
[2:20:24] <%VyperVic> nope
[2:20:25] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[2:20:26] <+fetrigon> get dat purple woolieYE
[2:20:27] <%hereiam407> Gotta catch em all
[2:20:32] <%solracc25> need time stop
[2:20:33] <+gustavozxd> that emmi's purple armor is an offense to Samus's gravity suit
[2:20:36] <Halospaz117> Spoilers, gun r purble
[2:20:38] <ToneBacas> you're gonna parry that EMMI, aren't you?
[2:20:43] <%AncelDeLambert> uh oh need purp beam
[2:20:43] <%scaryboisupreme> I thought the purple emmi was gonna be the grav suit
[2:20:43] <+TaurusOxford> Get the HeyGuys Beam
[2:20:48] <%trackles_64> just dont look at any doors then
[2:20:49] <%RealThiele> door says u need purple
[2:20:52] <%AncelDeLambert> oh no STILL need purp beam!
[2:20:53] <SaltyAzteca> You need a thing
[2:20:53] <+T4silly> Great I wonder how you kill that thing.
[2:20:55] <%InternetShis> Does purple beam taste like grape or purple?
[2:20:57] <%scaryboisupreme> GEE I WONDER WHAT IT'LL BE
[2:21:00] <Halospaz117> Man I never took this route before, I went the other way around
[2:21:01] <+T4silly> *gee
[2:21:02] <%hereiam407> That door is clearly blue
[2:21:03] <Blank9> I thought purple emmi was gonna be grav suit too, so getting it surprised me
[2:21:05] <+HakureiIllusion> Purple taste
[2:21:07] <%VictorVonLouche> Look at that hologram
[2:21:13] <%InternetShis> Oice
[2:21:13] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! thanks for being one of the most reliable sources of amusement in my life
[2:21:15] <An_Armed_Bear> Purple beam tastes like water, sugar, and purple
[2:21:16] <%scaryboisupreme> Hey why are the X looking at that Federation ship
[2:21:17] <+gustavozxd> yeah it's fucking awesome
[2:21:20] <KingJackel> it tastes like Purple
[2:21:20] <%VictorVonLouche> Fed ship
[2:21:20] <saddlezilla1> @scaryboisupreme same. but could u imagine how annoying that'd be? An EMMI tat manipulate gravity chasing u.
[2:21:21] <akitanito> a gunship
[2:21:21] <%SinnerEbru> gunship
[2:21:21] <+Rekinsinn> maybe a gunship
[2:21:21] <%trackles_64> like a darksouls experience
[2:21:22] <+zuzuxiv> federation ship
[2:21:23] <%AncelDeLambert> probably a ship
[2:21:24] <%SinnerEbru> shipgun
[2:21:24] <+TaurusOxford> This game is deceptively open
[2:21:24] <%Monkeyweed21> AC is on high
[2:21:24] <SaltyAzteca> THE PILLAR OF WINTER
[2:21:26] <+R_BChe> gunship
[2:21:26] <teefpal> It's the Federation ship
[2:21:27] <%SaiyanShoto> This game has so many ways to go its great
[2:21:27] <%scaryboisupreme> It's a federation starship
[2:21:27] <%hereiam407> Pillar of Autmun
[2:21:29] <%solracc25> many way arounds
[2:21:29] <%Monkeyweed21> SHIP GUN
[2:21:29] <+RyTYoung> this game is 100% my game of the year so far
[2:21:29] <Ralfclogs> GUN ship
[2:21:29] <+gustavozxd> I thought it was a big space gun
[2:21:30] <+T4silly> THE BFG 10000 IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL.
[2:21:31] <Saltmeisterr> its theemmi shi[
[2:21:31] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, that's a Fed ship from Prime
[2:21:32] <+D00msDayDan> the best spaceships look like guns
[2:21:33] <%greasypete00> it looks kinda like the ship from the opening cutscene
[2:21:35] <%trackles_64> could be a gunship
[2:21:35] <Asuterisuku> It's time for F-EMMI
[2:21:37] <saddlezilla1> The ship the EMMI came on
[2:21:37] <%Deft_Thought> You can use your melee counter to kill those robots mines before they explode
[2:21:38] <quipquest1> So a ship from Halo?
[2:21:39] <%MugenSandan> mayhaps tis some sort of... ship shaped gun
[2:21:40] <+zuzuxiv> it's the fed ship at the beginning of fusion
[2:21:43] <%ForlornCarton> I think it's the federation ship that brought the EMMI to the planet.
[2:21:43] <Halospaz117> Yeah I always went to this area then Up, you did the reverse
[2:21:44] <PanicSwytch> Yeah i found the teleporter before the train
[2:21:48] <%hereiam407> 'Man, its like a fridge in here, huh Samus?'
[2:21:50] <Zezuar> screw attack everything
[2:21:50] <SunsetJack> This is the intended path, people who went the other way around went the long way
[2:21:51] <+zuzuxiv> I THINK
[2:21:52] <%ScreamLord> I sequince broke the Grapple Beam before I took out the Green EMMI
[2:21:53] <Zezuar> life is much easier
[2:21:55] <%VictorVonLouche> Wrong way btw
[2:21:56] <+TombstoneTTromboners> use the screw attack!!!
[2:21:56] <%twistedj3ster> you can't just shoot a hole in the surface of ZDR
[2:21:58] <%InternetShis> I just started playing, that's a Fed ship from the Fusion recap
[2:22:10] <Spudmeister9000> pat just jump at shit and they die
[2:22:12] <Spudmeister9000> LUL
[2:22:15] <%scaryboisupreme> your bombs need more power
[2:22:18] <+gustavozxd> I haven't played any game that came out this year other than twewy and Metroid so I can't say
[2:22:18] <$StrawberryPantsu> MAN THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS
[2:22:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> everything in this room is mere prey before your screw attack.
[2:22:19] <%RealThiele> still
[2:22:21] <ToneBacas> you know how it goes
[2:22:25] <+Rekinsinn> @ScreamLord you learned to slide jump on your first run?
[2:22:26] <NenaFan101> Just finally 100% everything.  Some of these puzzles can be a pain in the ass
[2:22:28] <+youngjwilliams> those things hardcore look like hunter metroids
[2:22:28] <%trackles_64> Getting a bit op now
[2:22:30] <%Kiyosuki> Maybe it’s a hint to something deeper, the Feds can’t be trusted anymore
[2:22:36] <Spudmeister9000> guns are for bosses
[2:22:36] <trigunstar26> Yeah kinda reminds me of the Pillar of Autumn
[2:22:53] <Louie_Salmon> Pat you should try screw attack on enemies
[2:22:53] <+Namillus> @Kiyosuki Nah it just indicates that someone's been monitoring the feds
[2:23:07] <%RealThiele> its the ship that deployed the EMMis is all
[2:23:09] <%GalacticaPhanto> Pat just jump into enemies
[2:23:10] <+tsmasher1000> Has Pat played the other 2D Metroids and understands the lore?
[2:23:18] <Halospaz117> smrt
[2:23:24] <%scaryboisupreme> no
[2:23:25] <%Kiyosuki> Still can’t be trusted
[2:23:28] <+youngjwilliams> a little of super thats it
[2:23:35] <+tsmasher1000> Dang
[2:23:35] <KingJackel> EMMI time
[2:23:36] <Louie_Salmon> @tsmasher1000 Big no
[2:23:37] <saddlezilla1> @tsmasher1000 no
[2:23:39] <%Monkeyweed21> EMMI time
[2:23:41] <ToneBacas> blu
[2:23:44] <+TombstoneTTromboners> time for the omnipotent emmi
[2:23:45] <%hereiam407> Purp
[2:23:45] <+gustavozxd> no but all the """lore""" you need is in the intro
[2:23:46] <%scaryboisupreme> I like Metroid's story a lot. It's a lot like old bungie era story telling
[2:23:49] <IronGlorfindel> So why haven't the X infected machines like in Fusion?
[2:23:49] <+tsmasher1000> Lore of Metroid is pretty cool
[2:23:54] <Make_me_mad> Doing this one without the gravity suit is fun.
[2:23:55] <SaltyAzteca> Nice, time for dinner
[2:23:59] <Blank9> space jumping and gravity suit feels so unfair against this emmi
[2:24:00] <%RealThiele> piss
[2:24:01] <Visorak6> LUL
[2:24:01] <quipquest1> What a time to pause
[2:24:01] <%solracc25> oh no
[2:24:03] <+D00msDayDan> hold on EMMI i know you want my dna but i gotta take the dog out
[2:24:06] <KingJackel> "Hold up, EMMI, I gotta take a shit"
[2:24:07] <PanicSwytch> This water part fucked me up running from emmi
[2:24:09] <%baka_sugoi> F UU D
[2:24:09] <%InternetShis> Don't kill the neighbour
[2:24:14] <saddlezilla1> @tsmasher1000 to be fair. some of the story in dread is weird unless u read the manga.
[2:24:14] <+Namillus> @IronGlorfindel Those were probably sufficiently biological
[2:24:14] <Louie_Salmon> @tsmasher1000 It gives a pretty good recap at the start of this, at least.
[2:24:17] <miucsa51> LUL
[2:24:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Replace Emmi theme with Guardian theme from BotW
[2:24:18] <%ScreamLord> @Rekinsinn Kinda, I new how to do the sequence break before but DIDN'T know how to get the the Green EMMI's Omega Canon with out it. I still don't LUL
[2:24:20] <+Rolandknight> he has to do it since peach will get attack.
[2:24:20] <hydragoon513> @IronGlorfindel The robot they infected in Fusion had an actual brain in it.
[2:24:21] <%SaphronBlackbourne> @IronGlorfindel Box had organic components you exposed in the first fight
[2:24:23] <+RyTYoung> EMMi time? More like Steve BuscEMMI time HELL YEAH
[2:24:29] <%solracc25> Grav suit + water makes the emmi a joke
[2:24:32] <Make_me_mad> @IronGlorfindel The X could never infect a machine that didn't have biological components. The spider-tank had a brain based computer, and Samus' suit is techno-organic.
[2:24:38] <%GalacticaPhanto> is he really moving because of the shit neighbor because man that sucks
[2:24:44] <+tsmasher1000> Yeah that is true. Manga is pretty good on the lore and the main points of the story is at the beginning of Dread.
[2:24:56] <+Namillus> Yeah the power suit is Chozo Biotech
[2:24:56] <%Kiyosuki> I think elements of the story can be communicated through background details, it’s how it should be in these games imo
[2:24:57] <%DeepPix3l> Ayoo, am I here in the middle or early?
[2:25:01] <@PeachSaliva> @galacticaphanto no we have been planning on moving anyway
[2:25:08] <teefpal> My only problem with Metroid is how much of the story is communicated through single lines of text or background events, so figuring out the whole plot is like putting together 5 games of bull
[2:25:09] <Halospaz117> @RyTYoung That's actually a horrifying concept
[2:25:12] <+tsmasher1000> Feel like the Metroid lore is pretty cool though. Seems like one of the only Nintendo franchises that Nintendo actually puts some effort into the lore.
[2:25:14] <trigunstar26> Pat’s moving?!
[2:25:22] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PeachSaliva the staaars align.
[2:25:25] <+gustavozxd> @saddlezilla1 is it though, was pretty standard stuff to me and I only played the games
[2:25:26] <+RyTYoung> @halospaz117 yeah I'm not a fan of it ngl
[2:25:28] <%GalacticaPhanto> @peachsaliva Oh well I'm glad it was in the plan and not just because of Pepe le Pew
[2:25:29] <%MegadBlitz> pee break? where is pat staring at
[2:25:31] <teefpal> Like the Chozo language from this game is in both Prime 1 and Fusion
[2:25:35] <@PeachSaliva> @trigunstar26 not for a while but eventually
[2:25:47] <+RyTYoung> @patstaresat @peachsaliva sorry about what happened to you guys today
[2:25:50] <saddlezilla1> they put effort into zelda too. but they also forget it often lol.
[2:25:55] <Halospaz117> @RyTYoung Do you think you stay in chat in fear of what you created?
[2:25:58] <%ScreamLord> Besides the Light Suit what is ya'll favorite suit? I kinda like the Dark Suit but the PED suit from Prime 3 was pretty cool
[2:25:59] <%vexion_smh> glad no one is hurt tho
[2:26:03] <+gustavozxd> hey Paige I hope you're well despite all the bullshit atpQuan @peachsaliva
[2:26:04] <teefpal> And one of the hyrogliphics in this game show Space Pirates bowing to Raven Beak
[2:26:05] <+LazyAss24Seven> @PeachSaliva hope it all goes well! sucks that the environment is garbage when it comes to the people so hopefully it works out better in the long run.
[2:26:09] <+RyTYoung> It wasn't me I was not the crazy guy just saying LUL
[2:26:09] <@PeachSaliva> @rytyoung thanks. It’s such a bummer
[2:26:32] <+youngjwilliams> what happened?
[2:26:33] <Blu_C> Feel better soon Peach.
[2:26:40] <+harrisboe> @peachsaliva tell the asshole neighbor you will be traveling around Quebec to spread the English language and culture. Just to piss him off
[2:27:01] <saddlezilla1> @gustavozxd u can still get most of the main points. but there's some smaller stuff that works better w/ manga knowledge. Mainly a few small things w/ Raven.
[2:27:11] <%MegadBlitz> I think that's what we all want for ourselves and for everyone? bad environments are not good for the mental health and da soul
[2:27:11] <teefpal> I told yall about french canadians
[2:27:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @PeachSaliva Yeah, I know I'd be fucking shaking if that had happened to me. Get better soonish.
[2:27:14] <trigunstar26> Oh does he not like Americans?
[2:27:34] <+RyTYoung> Well here's something fucked up that happened to me and my girlfriend, we are away in a lodge, and the TV has netflix on it, so we're watching Squid Game, and no joke, someone connected their phone to the TV and put two pics of a naked girl spread...we were mortified...
[2:27:37] <%InternetShis> Quebec is a fuck
[2:28:04] <+TNT93o> @RyTYoung now that's a story
[2:28:18] <%polothegreatest> wtf LUL
[2:28:19] <%vexion_smh> Xenophobia is so fucked
[2:28:19] <%InternetShis> snuffOmg
[2:28:22] <%DeepPix3l> Francophones can be salty all they want, they'll never have a good hip hop scene cause their language sound dumb and flowery
[2:28:24] <+RyTYoung> @tnt93o literally happened an hour ago it was fucking weird
[2:28:30] <%MegadBlitz> that just sounds crazy @rytyoung
[2:28:35] <teefpal> Grown men acting like children is funny when to watch but terrifying up close
[2:28:37] <%scaryboisupreme> I feel like pat would move into a bunker if he could
[2:28:50] <+gustavozxd> @rytyoung that is some middle school level shitposting
[2:28:54] <+RyTYoung> @megadblitz w
[2:28:55] <+TNT93o> @RyTYoung start communicating with them. Send some feet
[2:28:57] <%Kiyosuki> Light Suit Phazeon Suit this games’ Gravity Suit and one other one are my faves
[2:29:03] <+RyTYoung> @megadblitz I wish I was making that shit up
[2:29:10] <+gustavozxd> could have been an image of shadow saying nice cock bro or something
[2:29:12] <%polothegreatest> thats, mmm CoolStoryBob
[2:29:21] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Pat and Paige should move to the northern most part of Canada.
[2:29:24] <Halospaz117> Think I already said it but GodDAMN Samus Returns had a sexy Grav Suit
[2:29:29] <%scaryboisupreme> @Kiyosuki Samus Returns gravity suit looks amazing too
[2:29:35] <%polothegreatest> kronk posting
[2:29:44] <%Kiyosuki> Returns Gravity Suit is quite nice
[2:29:45] <+RyTYoung> I could've changed the name of the TV to "Hey don't put porn on this tv thanks"
[2:29:49] <%MegadBlitz> @rytyoung sounds like something that makes me think, what if that was me, but at the same time I don't want whoever that was NEAR me
[2:29:50] <teefpal> Samus returns suit designs were thicc
[2:30:01] <%Kiyosuki> I like the look of this one a bit more if I had to choose though
[2:30:13] <Halospaz117> Seriously if he got a high quality version of Samus Returns Grav Suit, I'd be a very happy man
[2:30:20] <%GalacticaPhanto> @deeppix3l word it's like Hon hon hon yo
[2:30:23] <+RyTYoung> @megadblitz well thank fuck I'm checking out tomorrow so I hope to god I don't see whoever it was...
[2:30:25] <+youngjwilliams> Prime 2 and 3 Varia is pretty clean for me
[2:30:31] <d_shibbler> big poop
[2:30:34] <%Kiyosuki> It might not count totally but I like super hulk buster Samus from the Dread art book lol

[2:33:25] <+HakureiIllusion> Break the armor then screw attack its face off
[2:33:26] <+TNT93o> when is the next Mind Goblins stream?
[2:33:30] <HitchhikingThrough> try now
[2:33:38] <%AncelDeLambert> regular missiles are faster
[2:33:38] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it's neat seeing more of the chozo bio-ai that aren't mother brain
[2:33:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> FYI, beam spam has the best DPS
[2:33:51] <teefpal> Damn Samus voice actor is really good
[2:33:51] <+T4silly> I'm still surprised THESE THINGS aren't Xed up.
[2:33:52] <SunsetJack> Now the fun part...
[2:33:53] <KingJackel> Now for a really really tense segment
[2:33:57] <%Deft_Thought> Storm missiles are useful but they're kind of a trap. More expensive and with a longer fire time for slightly lower DPS then regular missiles.
[2:33:58] <+ZackTheGnomeChild> so this game is full mega man now?
[2:34:05] <+gustavozxd> this game as some big satisfying sound effects
[2:34:05] <saddlezilla1> Anyone else really love the design of Samus' boots in this game?
[2:34:08] <%AncelDeLambert> here we go, real shit real time
[2:34:11] <zealsteele> @T4silly They're fully robotic
[2:34:11] <greatspaceadventure> fucking sound design in this game is so delicious and chunky
[2:34:13] <%greasypete00> shoot
[2:34:14] <%AncelDeLambert> aim down
[2:34:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this ones special

[2:34:20] <%hereiam407> Samus kicks down the door
[2:34:21] <%Deft_Thought> @GeneralSCPatton Plus that, on enemies that aren't protected

[2:39:13] <@GeneralSCPatton> GeneralSCPatton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months, currently on a 39 month streak! Time for more PATronage. I really appreciate the goblin streams because I have a lot of the same goblins. Maybe I'll try to get over that shit too.

[2:39:26] <Alzero83> That Purple Stuff
[2:39:27] <Saltmeisterr> ur op now
[2:39:29] <+HakureiIllusion> Seventh one is hype AF
[2:39:32] <+TombstoneTTromboners> yes
[2:39:33] <SaltyAzteca> Goes through walls
[2:39:33] <+MisterAvry> sick
[2:39:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> wallhacks
[2:39:33] <+TombstoneTTromboners> it rules
[2:39:36] <Louie_Salmon> What if it was PURPLE?
[2:39:40] <akitanito> that's what wave beam always does
[2:39:44] <%hereiam407> @InternetShis A little bit
[2:39:47] <%RealThiele> so now that you got it theres a wave to do a fake wave beam and shoot through walls without it
[2:39:47] <+MisterAvry> Samus hax
[2:39:47] <SaltyAzteca> Its quite busted
[2:39:49] <%InternetShis> Wallhack beam meme
[2:39:53] <+D00msDayDan> see what enemy? you can kill it
[2:39:55] <%blastyoboots> OH RIGHT pat hasn't played a metroid much he DOESN'T KNOW about the wave beam
[2:39:56] <+gustavozxd> extremely late wave beam too
[2:39:57] <$MinoMiushi> Pat the wave beam has always gone through walls
[2:39:57] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You are the personification of Death.
[2:40:01] <+cermo55> There's one specific door that's tricky that you need this for
[2:40:01] <teh_Question> uh pat it's actually call a Spazer
[2:40:06] <%zarkazeon> now become the true spam god.
[2:40:09] <Blank9> wave beam's electric in prime
[2:40:11] <SaltyAzteca> WHERE IS POWER BOMB
[2:40:13] <Asuterisuku> Diffusion Beam is now completely unnecessary.
[2:40:15] <@GeneralSCPatton> Now beam spam has EVEN MORE SUPERIOR DPS
[2:40:15] <%RealThiele> spazer is the wide beam chump
[2:40:18] <%solracc25> need timestop
[2:40:31] <marvel877> He knows about the wave beam from Prime, but not in the 2d metroids.
[2:40:31] <$StrawberryPantsu> WAVE BEAM BABY
[2:40:32] <%hereiam407> The trivializer
[2:40:37] <%InternetShis> Thia
[2:40:38] <zealsteele> Wave beam also does even more damage
[2:40:41] <+ReiDuran> imagine being sent to take out samus and getting shot through a fucking wall
[2:40:41] <teefpal> Now you can open the purple door
[2:40:41] <%Akizea> wallhacks
[2:40:46] <%InternetShis> This thing nuts
[2:40:49] <%ScreamLord> That just totally invalidated the Diffusion Beam doesn't it?
[2:40:52] <scarman125> the timestop joke was never funny
[2:40:53] <Calek> wave beam goes through walls in prime 1 as well y'all
[2:40:53] <+gustavozxd> Pat can't even react to something and people will correct him atpCap
[2:40:55] <%RealThiele> yea beam spam is king when usable
[2:40:59] <%solracc25> everything is now a non problem
[2:41:04] <%zarkazeon> time for hardest emmi
[2:41:06] <+Namillus> Diffusion Beam still has the impact blast but yeah kinda
[2:41:07] <Airuzen> @ScreamLord think of it as the next step up from Diffusion then
[2:41:08] <%twistedj3ster> back to hannah barbara
[2:41:09] <%MugenSandan> DA SHIP
[2:41:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you 100%ing this or running headlong towards ending?
[2:41:16] <+Rekinsinn> For some reason I just got reminded of the farsight
[2:41:16] <%MegaXZerolegends> Yup
[2:41:18] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre both useful
[2:41:18] <+gustavozxd> yeah it's kinda like that
[2:41:19] <%InternetShis> Back to... Train
[2:41:25] <%Monkeyweed21> they're both good
[2:41:26] <%solracc25> now to the car
[2:41:27] <%hereiam407> Yes
[2:41:28] <%VyperVic> crack cocaine plot time
[2:41:38] <+gustavozxd> screw attack before power bomb
[2:41:41] <+HakureiIllusion> Missiles in this game tend to almost always be stronger but in Fusion they more or less flip-flopped every time you upgraded one
[2:41:44] <+gustavozxd> late wave beam
[2:41:45] <%hereiam407> Going from the underground to the sky
[2:41:52] <teefpal> All-locks Missile Storm is the highest damage attack
[2:41:56] <Halospaz117> Admittedly, you didn't have the ship AT ALL in the OG Metroid
[2:42:01] <%Deft_Thought> Late morphball forces you to play with the newer toolset a lot more
[2:42:04] <+gustavozxd> I haven't played other M
[2:42:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> OH THIS IS THE GOOD PART

[2:42:17] <%hereiam407> I forgot
[2:42:18] <%InternetShis> Goopa

[2:45:32] <%hereiam407> A fuckin NUKE
[2:45:34] <+tsmasher1000> Samus is too badass
[2:45:36] <%barrakuta371> PFFFFTTT
[2:45:36] <jett_eyes> I was thinking it was the wrestling move
[2:45:37] <Bananassassin> So at this point you can backtrack without fear of having to do it again later
[2:45:39] <%InternetShis> KaBOOM
[2:45:41] <$realm_forge> Now she can do wrestling moves
[2:45:41] <%rekinom> I'm starting to think maybe the thing we're supposed to be Dreading is Samus
[2:45:41] <%Niney_Who> Literally the final upgrade
[2:45:42] <kingra> BOY IS IT
[2:45:42] <%solracc25> motivated
[2:45:42] <%greasypete00> really late
[2:45:43] <AzaroRequiem> as if Samus wasn's fucking strong enough already lol
[2:45:44] <%hereiam407> This thing is more powerful than any power bomb I've ever seen
[2:45:44] <AngryAsian5> Literally a walking nuke
[2:45:45] <An_Armed_Bear> It's usually late isnt it?
[2:45:47] <%JoshManVGH> Hey you got some upgrades got that

[2:45:49] <%Niney_Who> yes
[2:45:49] <%greasypete00> yes
[2:45:49] <+TaurusOxford> yes
[2:45:50] <greatspaceadventure> power bomb is historically a late item
[2:45:50] <@GeneralSCPatton> This game is very generous with power bomb ammo
[2:45:50] <%Chichen> ya
[2:45:50] <ToneBacas> yes
[2:45:51] <blackjack8182> Do you have permission from Adam to use the power bombs
[2:45:51] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[2:45:52] <+ReiDuran> yes
[2:45:52] <%InternetShis> Samus is getting more broken and more angry

[2:45:57] <+tsmasher1000> yes
[2:45:58] <%ForlornCarton> Mostly Robot enemies
[2:45:59] <%spitelite> yeah
[2:46:00] <+D00msDayDan> power bomb ammo comes from resupply points
[2:46:00] <%Jeemukun> yeah you just got some
[2:46:00] <Blank9> the M's
[2:46:01] <%hereiam407> Just did
[2:46:02] <%RustyCoyoteA> Yes
[2:46:04] <ToneBacas> no survivors
[2:46:05] <ape_hawk> samus is now pretty much All For One
[2:46:05] <tangowulf> I'm sorry but the lights on Samus' suit make it look like she's wearing the Borat speedo
[2:46:05] <$realm_forge> Yes
[2:46:05] <%solracc25> now to clean up
[2:46:08] <+attoram> Yeah it's like missle ammo but just a slightly lower drop rate
[2:46:08] <%tank7013> Yes but it's less common
[2:46:09] <marvel877> you're getting them now, yeah
[2:46:09] <willsin4fun> people who've called Samus Metroid have now been vindicated
[2:46:09] <%solracc25> yep
[2:46:10] <SunsetJack> You picked up those before cause you start with 2 normally.
[2:46:10] <%greasypete00> you get a lot of it too
[2:46:11] <%dekkitout> Just a Bfg in her back pocket
[2:46:18] <%scaryboisupreme> hey those ships look spaceworthy
[2:46:19] <%VictorVonLouche> Its a MULTPLE ROOM CLEAR in some areas
[2:46:20] <thisisacoolguy> Yeah, they just drop less common than others @PatStaresAt
[2:46:20] <%twistedj3ster> that poor robot
[2:46:23] <Blank9> who needs x ray when you can power bomb
[2:46:26] <$realm_forge> DISRESPECT YOUR SURROUNDINGS
[2:46:28] <+TombstoneTTromboners> Turns out Samus was the titular Metroid this time!
[2:46:31] <ToneBacas> are you mashing super hard there to shoot that fast?
[2:46:31] <Shwepie> What's Pat's secret mashing technique?
[2:46:34] <%GustauveVIII> a literal nuke
[2:46:37] <%hereiam407> Adam: "damn, maybe I was wrong about this whole thing"
[2:46:41] <blue8moon> big strong
[2:46:41] <FollowDatDolphin> Tactical nuke

[2:46:47] <+HakureiIllusion> Cam
[2:46:48] <%hereiam407> NUKE
[2:46:48] <+attoram> Power bombs also destroy regular bomb blocks
[2:46:52] <+TombstoneTTromboners> "fuck your planet"
[2:46:54] <+Havictos> @ToneBacas He's really good at mashing
[2:46:55] <Saltmeisterr> the classic
[2:46:56] <mr_mister0> nice reference
[2:46:56] <mothdude> Dead brain
[2:46:58] <%RustyCoyoteA> Lying walls have nothing to say now
[2:46:59] <+HakureiIllusion> Can't go a Metroid game without blowing up a glass tunnel
[2:46:59] <+McDerpus> super metroid throwback
[2:47:00] <akitanito> casually destroy the planet
[2:47:00] <SaltyAzteca> Anything you screen nuke sucks into you
[2:47:02] <Halospaz117> GOOD

[2:47:14] <%hereiam407> That's how it should work
[2:47:15] <+T4silly> good
[2:47:17] <%spitelite> as it should
[2:47:18] <%iamthe_salt> iamthe_salt subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! 
[2:47:19] <SaltyAzteca> THATS HOW IT SHOULD BE
[2:47:19] <haisho> it's practically tradition at this point
[2:47:19] <%InternetShis> Feature

[2:50:28] <%JoshManVGH> Unidirectional doors is dumb
[2:50:29] <Gamers_RiseUp> you can power bomb in the room before the emmi door to save yourself time
[2:50:31] <Blank9> one room right

[2:50:41] <%RealThiele> you did it!
[2:50:42] <SunsetJack> Yea, no go back, the door closes fast.
[2:50:45] <%greasypete00> its much easier to get from the other way
[2:50:46] <%VyperVic> there's the answer
[2:50:48] <+dante_must_die_exe> @JoshManVGH but effective LUL
[2:50:49] <%VictorVonLouche> You can power bomb the next room

[2:51:29] <%InternetShis> I HURT
[2:51:33] <HitchhikingThrough> you can open that one way from below
[2:51:35] <%scaryboisupreme> I remember doing this one a different way

[2:51:39] <%greasypete00> go to the other side
[2:51:43] <%blastyoboots> no that's how to do it you just have to
[2:51:43] <PanicSwytch> Go up to the room before the speed boost
[2:51:43] <marvel877> Work on your timing, Pat.
[2:51:46] <+gustavozxd> there's probably another way, but THAT is how I did it
[2:51:49] <mothdude> There are two ways to do it
[2:51:50] <Saltmeisterr> WAIT PAT
[2:51:52] <Saltmeisterr> go back
[2:51:54] <+ReiDuran> you can go up in that previous room

[2:56:10] <@goose_attack_almanac> The X has chosen Style
[2:56:14] <+rorschachsjournal505> This the real chozo
[2:56:15] <deejay782> how is pat firing so quickly
[2:56:20] <+gustavozxd> oh yeah different shield
[2:56:20] <+LastHazzerd> The Arbiter
[2:56:22] <%scaryboisupreme> mash
[2:56:26] <mr_mister0> hes fast
[2:56:28] <%RealThiele> pat has mash skill
[2:56:28] <jett_eyes> why's the covenant in this game
[2:56:31] <+Rekinsinn> wow I completely missed that opportunity to counter
[2:56:33] <%ScreamLord> Mash Master
[2:56:34] <+Havictos> with thumb
[2:56:36] <An_Armed_Bear> I wish they didn't have you fight like 6 of these things
[2:56:36] <Spudmeister9000> hes got a damn turbo buttom
[2:56:36] <+TombstoneTTromboners> he got super fingers
[2:56:38] <%tank7013> Not everyone knows your dank mashing tech
[2:56:38] <%hereiam407> Hopefully Gravemind doesn't show up
[2:56:40] <+tsmasher1000> Pat's the world's best masher
[2:56:41] <%spitelite> storm missile is better
[2:56:45] <jorniev> PAT IS REALLY GOOD AT MASHING
[2:56:46] <+Renewed> grapple beamed PogChamp
[2:56:47] <%Townspoon> wtf thats not normal mashing
[2:56:47] <%scaryboisupreme> Pat's always beena mashter
[2:56:47] <%Niney_Who> Paige must be lucky
[2:56:49] <%InternetShis> Crack hands help a lot
[2:56:49] <jumpyhugs> mash is best DPS
[2:56:50] <%solracc25> tool assist
[2:57:02] <+TombstoneTTromboners> alas
[2:57:05] <%polothegreatest> psaSkelmo
[2:57:06] <churropoppa> @spitelite why don't you storm missile yourself some bitches
[2:57:06] <%RealThiele> 7 e-tanks down later
[2:57:07] <Asuterisuku> Woolie did not notice the blue light on the shield.
[2:57:09] <%Deft_Thought> Nah, just dodge
[2:57:09] <@GeneralSCPatton> Just mash
[2:57:11] <%blastyoboots> that ink blast does over 200 damage
[2:57:11] <%InternetShis> I have crack hands but that requires full hand devotion to one button
[2:57:12] <%scaryboisupreme> Nah the wave beam is more DPS
[2:57:12] <%hereiam407> It helps
[2:57:12] <%VictorVonLouche> pat stop eating like 1/4 of you health hits
[2:57:12] <marvel877> F
[2:57:15] <+StingRayVA> orgasm
[2:57:16] <wqorst> dead mashers do no dps
[2:57:16] <KingJackel> Flash helps for those beams
[2:57:16] <TioXyco> "I feel confident enough"
[2:57:18] <%GustauveVIII> its fun knowing you can mash harder than your friends because you're giving yourself arthritis
[2:57:18] <%tank7013> Mashing wave beam like that is better overall but much harder
[2:57:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, how are you this incapable of letting go of the aim button?
[2:57:18] <+LastHazzerd> DPS race
[2:57:19] <+Namillus> Patmus just has the Beam Burst aeion power installed at all times
[2:57:19] <thisisacoolguy> don't get owned it sucks and you die when that happens
[2:57:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt try powa bomb
[2:57:19] <haisho> this is...advanced mashing!
[2:57:19] <Saltmeisterr> beam is better dps
[2:57:25] <%RealThiele> those chozo do NOT mess around
[2:57:26] <%VictorVonLouche> They do not play games they are here to kill
[2:57:31] <ShinBojangles> Your thumb hurts?
[2:57:37] <teefpal> I did not think the shield was destructible, I thought that was the point of the fight
[2:57:38] <%solracc25> beaam does hurt
[2:57:39] <FollowDatDolphin> beam spam is better, just harder to aim
[2:57:40] <+harrisboe> Mashing is an art, and Pat has mashtered it
[2:57:40] <%tank7013> Got Pat like doodMash doodMash doodInjury doodInjury
[2:57:54] <%blastyoboots> oh that's DEFINITELY doing more damage than wave beam did
[2:57:54] <bobdoletrasher> @patstaresat I can't even do it that fast with my wanking hand
[2:57:54] <%RealThiele> he doesnt mash with his thumb it would be the muscles in his wrist taking the damage
[2:57:58] <+Renewed> storm missile bullying lytRUN

But then you take my 75 perchance-chance of winnin' (if we was to go one on one), and then add 66 and two thirds…percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at ZDR! Samus? The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at ZDR!"

[3:06:39] <%hewlettfan96> Metroid dad

[3:06:41] <RaimeTT> this is my favourite boss fight in any metroid imo
[3:06:42] <+healnavi> @havictos Gray Voice is her "raised her" dad, like Adam. Raven is her biological Chozo dad, like Mr. Aran
[3:06:42] <%tank7013> @realm_forge He's obsessed with strength and wants to have the strongest army
[3:06:44] <Syrushmx> so that means this is samus 3rd birthday?
[3:06:44] <%hereiam407> Shooting rockets hurts him
[3:06:46] <$MinoMiushi> Pat it is hurting him its why he changes color
[3:06:48] <510BrotherPanda> @havictos Grey Voice was probably her daddy, but I guess this bird is her "father"
[3:06:49] <Louie_Salmon> It is though
[3:06:49] <crash400> it's the golden armor that's invisible.
[3:06:49] <+TombstoneTTromboners> this is so fucking cool
[3:06:49] <+zoopbooploop> It's hurting him
[3:06:49] <%polothegreatest> light and dark aura psaCaw psaBig
[3:06:51] <+Rekinsinn> its not hurting but its advancing the fight
[3:06:51] <%solracc25> it helps
[3:06:54] <+Renewed> get styled on
[3:06:59] <+zoopbooploop> FUCK YESSSSSS
[3:06:59] <%RealThiele> beam sword
[3:06:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> She's got like...two pseudo dads. So basically she has 3 dads.
[3:07:00] <+tsmasher1000> YEYEYEYE
[3:07:02] <%MegaXZerolegends> Beam is better at this point during counter
[3:07:02] <+Pachi3000> 3 missiles kill those orbs
[3:07:05] <+PA_august> The eternal war of Chozo Nerd vs Chozo Jock
[3:07:09] <+preppyposs> HE DOESNT CARE HOLY SHIT
[3:07:10] <+JonathLP> The aura tells you what he's defending against
[3:07:11] <redwidow1358> 4 missiles
[3:07:19] <+Pachi3000> oh right, 4
[3:07:19] <%scaryboisupreme> You gotta get him red
[3:07:21] <%hereiam407> Rockets
[3:07:24] <+TombstoneTTromboners> her human dad, old bird, and now her bio bird dad
[3:07:25] <blackjack8182> Use the devil bringer
[3:07:27] <%MechArch> so you've lowkey been playing nero this whole time
[3:07:28] <+Pachi3000> it does
[3:07:30] <teefpal> If you dont hear a clink sound you're doing damage
[3:07:32] <%greasypete00> it hurts you
[3:07:32] <+Renewed> cool thing is the gist of how to fight him was shown at the game's start
[3:07:33] <+tsmasher1000> She has a few dads - some genetically and some adoptive. This is her gene dad that doesn't care about anything other than the Metroid DNA.
[3:07:34] <+T4silly> Yes it hurts.
[3:07:34] <KingJackel> yes that hurts
[3:07:34] <%hereiam407> Yes
[3:07:36] <DigiDom> yes it hurts
[3:07:36] <TioXyco> it hurts
[3:07:37] <%tank7013> Imagine this fuckin' dude in smash though
[3:07:39] <+tsmasher1000> YEYEYEYE
[3:07:40] <%InternetShis> It does
[3:07:41] <%Maids4lyfe> YES IT HURTS IT MAKE SHTE HURTY NOISE PAT
[3:07:41] <Halospaz117> The fuck do you mean you can't tell?
[3:07:41] <+YoSoyConando89> Storm Missiles seem to do SOMETHING to him at this point, but countering him hurts him for reals
[3:07:42] <RaimeTT> god it so fucking cool aaaaaa
[3:07:42] <$Jaxnos> NOW THIS IS MY TYPE OF ANIME
[3:07:43] <+healnavi> @zaphire_saucypants Samus had five dads. bio dad, bio bird dad, two birds who raised her and Adam
[3:07:43] <hollumdusk> both Gray Voice and Raven are her dad, is DNA mix betwee  tribes
[3:07:44] <+harrisboe> You are my daaaad~ You’re my dad! Boogiewoogiewoogie!

[3:07:54] <+Fooguwu> No pat it's an attack that does nothing
[3:07:54] <Aeroallways> Now it does not hurt

[3:08:16] <+LastHazzerd> HOLY SMOKES
[3:08:16] <Auros_Mavrix_Dracos> @patstaresat When They adopted her when her parents were killed, they injected her with Chozo DNA so she could more comfortably live on their planet. After the X parasite infected her, she was injected with Metroid DNA to counter it. Now all of it combined to make her a hybrid Chozo/Metroid/Human.

[3:08:28] <%solracc25> the worst one
[3:08:29] <+Pachi3000> It's SO hard to dodge
[3:08:29] <Louie_Salmon> @victorvonlouche Don't worry, he can get it on try 11
[3:08:30] <+JonathLP> the bird is upped
[3:08:31] <$TenguGemini> this is easily the best final boss in the series
[3:08:32] <+jigglypuffthedovahkin> "you FUCKING sorry??"
[3:08:33] <%dekkitout> Is the greates pride a father could feel being defeated by his kid for the fate of the universe? Because I think yes.
[3:08:34] <+tsmasher1000> This boss is sick af
[3:08:47] <%RealThiele> beeeeeeem
[3:08:48] <%RustyCoyoteA> This Storm Eagle fight looks a lot different than I remember
[3:08:52] <+Pachi3000> He's fucking Silverbolt
[3:08:56] <%GarbageNirvana> He reminds me of a Mega Man X Sigma fight
[3:08:57] <+dmbender> "I am the storm that is approachinngggggg"
[3:08:57] <%GarbageNirvana> But like a good one
[3:09:05] <+tsmasher1000> The greatest pride is having a daughter that's the most badass warrior in the universe - just as badass as you LUL
[3:09:07] <%VictorVonLouche> @Louie_Salmon Nah he's gonna get it on first try just watch
[3:09:09] <+Redpointshine> This is actually a really cool final boss
[3:09:09] <FollowDatDolphin> slide or ball
[3:09:09] <Azathotic> Ridley: NOOOO YOU CANT BE A BETTER NEMESIS THAN ME
[3:09:11] <+Pachi3000> duck under that

[3:09:22] <%polothegreatest> psaSkelmo
[3:09:23] <%hereiam407> First try
[3:09:24] <+HakureiIllusion> Don't forget to slide under his high attacks
[3:09:24] <%hereiam407> Damn
[3:09:25] <DeeVee_TV> melted
[3:09:26] <%GustauveVIII> slide when he tries to ram you pat
[3:09:26] <Kain5707> he turns into Ridley when he slams down
[3:09:27] <teh_Question> that gun fucking sucks
[3:09:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Don't forget slide and flash
[3:09:27] <+TungstenViper> Pat, you have a SLIDE
[3:09:29] <+Pachi3000> Those rapid shots are the worst and they go on so long
[3:09:29] <Madinki> @Louie_Salmon Ha
[3:09:30] <+dante_must_die_exe> use the POWER BOMB or whatever
[3:09:30] <+tsmasher1000> This guy stronk
[3:09:30] <%hereiam407> Or second, or third
[3:09:31] <+Pachi3000> Yea he is
[3:09:33] <RaimeTT> He is
[3:09:33] <%hereiam407> Hell yeh
[3:09:35] <%scaryboisupreme> you ain't seen nothing yet
[3:09:35] <blackjack8182> F
[3:09:37] <Gelphaze> That's an HP melter
[3:09:39] <+ReiDuran> Raven Beak RULES
[3:09:40] <+geobuster> best Metroid final boss IMO
[3:09:40] <TerrifyingRei_05> he's using the missile combos from Prime 2¡
[3:09:41] <+attoram> It's a long fight
[3:09:41] <%dekkitout> He's too cool to make johns about
[3:09:43] <+LastHazzerd> yeah he is~!
[3:09:44] <+Pachi3000> Dadtroid
[3:09:44] <CanadianAnimatorGuy> Isshin Beak
[3:09:45] <Blank9> he's so cool
[3:09:45] <+zoopbooploop> Honestly, getting to phase 2 on attempt 2 is incredible
[3:09:47] <%polothegreatest> LUL
[3:09:47] <%InternetShis> You can slide under his low dash
[3:09:47] <+Rekinsinn> LUL
[3:09:47] <AoiRob> you can crouch, slide or ball under the horizontall flying tackle
[3:09:48] <PanicSwytch> Slide when he tackles u
[3:09:50] <%SaphronBlackbourne> I always just morph balled when I saw he was gonna ram me lol
[3:09:50] <teh_Question> WHAT IF METROID WAS A GRILL????
[3:09:50] <%tank7013> Well, one of like 7 dads
[3:09:50] <%Deft_Thought> YOU DIDN'T!
[3:09:51] <+harrisboe> It’s the best boss fight in all of metroid
[3:09:52] <+JonathLP> Wait til you get the the 9th phase
[3:09:52] <RaimeTT> LUL
[3:09:52] <%RaziWraith> That's Impossible! BibleThump
[3:09:53] <teefpal> Slide under dash, watch out for big beam
[3:09:53] <@GeneralSCPatton> One of several dads
[3:09:54] <reonome> why does metroid dad
[3:09:54] <jorniev> HE IS METROIDS DAD
[3:09:55] <+healnavi> dadtroid
[3:09:55] <+LastHazzerd> LUL
[3:09:55] <+preppyposs> it's one of her 4 parents
[3:09:55] <%twistedj3ster> It actually feels good when you get punched into the wall, it's crazy
[3:09:55] <%scaryboisupreme> It's absolutely not wrong to call Samus metroid now
[3:09:56] <+CherteuseKapibara> MercyWing1 majinoCaw majinoZulu1 majinoZulu2
[3:09:56] <ToneBacas> what's the stance on backseat gaming?
[3:09:57] <+gustavozxd> that sounded intentional LUL
[3:09:58] <+Namillus> Metroid Dread? Metroid DAD
[3:09:58] <%G_Thunders> Why does Metroid have so many dads?
[3:09:58] <+LastHazzerd> you were right
[3:10:02] <+TungstenViper> now METROID is the name of the game and main character
[3:10:04] <%VictorVonLouche> Beam the fuck out of him
[3:10:04] <+LastHazzerd> in 3 ways you were right
[3:10:05] <%Chichen> finally, she's the game title
[3:10:05] <librettodude> But can Metroid's Dad Crawl?
[3:10:07] <greatspaceadventure> i mean, the chozo have technically always been the metroid's dads
[3:10:07] <Saltmeisterr> METROID HAVE MANY DAD
[3:10:08] <%blastyoboots> powah boms?
[3:10:09] <Blank9> get wallsplat by a rekka
[3:10:11] <%VyperVic> metroid has 4 genetic parents. it's fucked
[3:10:12] <spinningchurro> can you even land a power bomb on any boss?  seems like it’d take too long.
[3:10:12] <blackjack8182> Jane Metroid’s dad John Metroid
[3:10:12] <+T4silly> Those Melee attacks are what got me on this fight.
[3:10:13] <%hereiam407> 'How can we have Metroids if Samus killed all of them?' 'I have an idea.'
[3:10:15] <+ReiDuran> this guy could easily be a fighting game boss
[3:10:17] <mothdude> She's got like three bird dads, a flesh dad, and a robot dad.
[3:10:23] <+YoSoyConando89> She's got a second bird dad
[3:10:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Namillus Don't you have dread when you see your parents at events
[3:10:24] <DigiDom> use flash step
[3:10:24] <%RealThiele> backseating is usuallt not great but it seems to happen
[3:10:24] <Treasure_Vault> Link and Zelda better fusion in BOTW2 so we can call him Zelda and be right
[3:10:25] <+McDerpus> so we go from maternity issues in other M to daddy issues in dread
[3:10:29] <%Niney_Who> I hope pat sees him Taunt
[3:10:31] <crash400> you can attack him when he has tye purple aura. it's the golden aura that you can only parry
[3:10:33] <+YoSoyConando89> Gray Voice
[3:10:33] <+tsmasher1000> Metroid used to be the name of the specimen that threatened the universe. Now it is the species of the main character.
[3:10:34] <+McDerpus> Metroid: Dad
[3:10:36] <+LastHazzerd> he helped make the metroids, he helped make chozo-samus, and he helped make metroid-samus
[3:10:36] <+healnavi> @tungstenviper it's been both since Zero Mission, technically Fusion
[3:10:38] <librettodude> @mothdude don't forget The Baby Dad
[3:10:41] <fcKurl> @mothdude and a parasite dad right
[3:10:42] <greatspaceadventure> so we've had the baby, the mother, and the dad, so all that's left now is the sibling and the auntie
[3:10:44] <%scaryboisupreme> So you shoot him to charge up his shield so you can parry that attack too
[3:10:46] <BlackermanZX> shoot him pat
[3:10:50] <reonome> hey metroid how come your mom let you have two dads
[3:10:51] <%Dova573> You still gotta do damage to his shield pat
[3:10:52] <+YoSoyConando89> And a bird grandpa\old dad
[3:10:53] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt you still have to hit him
[3:10:56] <Kain5707> pat...
[3:10:59] <+YoSoyConando89> Old Bird
[3:10:59] <+HakureiIllusion> He still takes damage in the beginning, gotta hit him
[3:11:00] <olaksi> Metroid: Ad D
[3:11:00] <KingJackel> shot him
[3:11:01] <%greasypete00> hes such a drama queen
[3:11:02] <+TungstenViper> @healnavi yeah, more like Fusion
[3:11:03] <Azathotic> My two gay bird dads
[3:11:04] <Bananassassin> Raven Beak is like the pinnacle of 2D shooting boss design for me
[3:11:08] <Bananassassin> Such a great fight
[3:11:09] <+harrisboe> Reminder that “Metroid” is the Chozo word for “ultimate warrior”
[3:11:10] <%afronooch> @tsmasher1000 With as many planets as Samus has destroyed, she's still a threat to the universe
[3:11:11] <%VictorVonLouche> Pat break the shield by overloading it
[3:11:11] <Tham1k> Parry only challenge
[3:11:12] <+Pachi3000> you do
[3:11:15] <KingJackel> you do
[3:11:18] <%JGardner03> @PatStaresAt Its much faster to mash the beam for that since it does more damage in that window
[3:11:18] <DigiDom> you do
[3:11:18] <+preppyposs> god you know who's going to really mark out at this fight? woolie
[3:11:19] <Saltmeisterr> you do
[3:11:23] <StingtheKing> Hitting him does speed up the fight.
[3:11:23] <Blank9> samus has at least 2 bird dads, adam dad, adam ai dad, and a real but dead dad
[3:11:26] <%AncelDeLambert> I think at most hitting him just makes him pull his parry out faster
[3:11:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> when he's red, you do.
[3:11:30] <+tsmasher1000> @afronooch That's true. She's destroyed more than the Metroids probably, that's for sure KEKW
[3:11:31] <AzaroRequiem> so is Pat never gonna get hit by that liver punch? lol
[3:11:31] <librettodude> For Phase 1-1, you have to break his shield once
[3:11:34] <FollowDatDolphin> you don't, but hitting once is a free counter
[3:11:34] <%RealThiele> @preppyposs he did it was great
[3:11:35] <Zaphire_Saucypants> dammit
[3:11:35] <+the22cstomp> @preppyposs he already did
[3:11:35] <An_Armed_Bear> I think this technically works but it's the harder way
[3:11:36] <+Namillus> @preppyposs You know who SUPER DID mark out at this fight? Woolie
[3:11:36] <+Bluydee> @preppyposs he did
[3:11:37] <+HakureiIllusion> Woolie already beat this game, and yes, he hyped out at it
[3:11:37] <+D00msDayDan> my favorite thing about this boss is every single part of your kit has some place in this fight
[3:11:37] <Rav3Games> I mean you don't but it's slower
[3:11:38] <+YoSoyConando89> Jump and phase shift for his punching
[3:11:39] <%polothegreatest> isnt SA-X and dark Samus her siblings?
[3:11:39] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz I beat him without hitting him in the first phase at all
[3:11:39] <%twistedj3ster> Nope
[3:11:39] <greatspaceadventure> @Bananassassin i think i would describe some fights from Hollow Knight in a similar way
[3:11:40] <%scaryboisupreme> you do a cool thing if you hit him enough
[3:11:40] <%VictorVonLouche> Deliberately SKipping THE COOLEST CONTENT
[3:11:40] <marvel877> @preppyposs he beat this already on stream
[3:11:41] <fcKurl> yeah i did this fight without hitting him once he turned pink
[3:11:42] <jorniev> LIVER BLOW
[3:11:42] <DigiDom> both work
[3:11:42] <%tank7013> Hitting him until he's gold causes parry opportunities to trigger way more often. Just makes things go faster
[3:11:43] <%twistedj3ster> psaWrong
[3:11:44] <%cvp5127> bird up
[3:11:44] <%greasypete00> you have to damage him enough first
[3:11:47] <+Pachi3000> I mean yeah but it's slower
[3:11:47] <Azathotic> Hitting him forces a QTE
[3:11:51] <sabieri> brucegFlappingwingleft brucegGoosehead brucegFlappingwingright 📣 bird up
[3:11:52] <FalseKingAki> is that a chozo?
[3:11:52] <+preppyposs> OH WOOLIE BEAT IT ALREADY?
[3:11:54] <sennoh> chat just lying like that LUL
[3:11:54] <greatspaceadventure> @Bananassassin dont get me wrong tho this fight is amazing!
[3:11:55] <+senfood> BIRD UP
[3:11:55] <%InternetShis> BIRD UP AGAIN
[3:11:56] <%Chichen> psaWrong
[3:11:58] <%Niney_Who> HE BLOCKS THAT SHIT
[3:11:59] <%scaryboisupreme> OH I WISH
[3:12:00] <JacknZack27> It just takes longer
[3:12:03] <sabieri> @FalseKingAki yes
[3:12:04] <redwidow1358> You cannot
[3:12:04] <%BisoromiBear> you thought
[3:12:05] <%greencapps> it's faster if you do and then morph ball to dodge the big wave he does
[3:12:05] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah no that aint gonna work with him
[3:12:05] <+Renewed> shinespark shut down
[3:12:06] <%hereiam407> Bonk

[3:12:53] <greatspaceadventure> @wqorst just you wait
[3:12:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I just spammed the fuck out of beam this phase.
[3:13:11] <+T4silly> Ayyyy nailed the pattern.
[3:13:11] <Azathotic> @fcKurl First phase, energy wave across 90% of the screen > duck forces a QTE into gold armor. At that point, just gotta wait for parry moment

[3:14:06] <+MrIntake> my man threw a sun in the air
[3:14:07] <FollowDatDolphin> chat maybe no more backseating lol
[3:14:07] <runewalker01> Woolie is gonna lose his shit when he sees that
[3:14:07] <+TombstoneTTromboners> WAIT YOU CAN POWER BOMB THE SUN???
[3:14:07] <+preppyposs> THE SUN
[3:14:08] <teh_Question> BRUH JUST WAIT TIL PHAISE 5
[3:14:08] <Madinki> @fcKurl Can't fly with just one wing
[3:14:08] <TioXyco> remember the Final Song from the Bunker? yeah, that
[3:14:09] <+attoram> Dude is Dracula and Vergil rolled into one
[3:14:10] <@Lion_kun> Knowing how to deal with that sun made the fight so much easier.
[3:14:10] <+zoopbooploop> Powerbomb da sun
[3:14:11] <PanicSwytch> Praise the Sun
[3:14:11] <%dekkitout> Dracula. Another cool, evil dad
[3:14:11] <+Bluydee> I'LL DESTROY THIS PLANET
[3:14:12] <+KaguraRaion> @fcKurl Because what purpose would it serve leaving it.... he lost one you cant do shit with one wing
[3:14:13] <%hereiam407> Sephiroth
[3:14:13] <Davybot> turned into Okuu
[3:14:13] <+Kharinite> this is literally the coolest boss fight i've seen all year
[3:14:13] <Spudmeister9000> shut it chat
[3:14:14] <marvel877> beam spam his final phase
[3:14:14] <%scaryboisupreme> Watch Raven Beak NOT get into the next Smash
[3:14:14] <%emMmDeeKay> Raven Beak ain't free
[3:14:14] <%polothegreatest> Nuke the SUN psaCaw psaDab
[3:14:15] <mm_orios> stfu chat
[3:14:16] <%VictorVonLouche> When things are dire Power Bomb the fuck out of it.
[3:14:16] <+TaurusOxford> @TombstoneTTromboners yes
[3:14:17] <%RealThiele> Evil Alucard
[3:14:19] <%tank7013> @TombstoneTTromboners Ye
[3:14:19] <+Take_2_shots> That ain't Sephiroth, that's Falco
[3:14:20] <%valriot> They finally made a good Castlevania
[3:14:20] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Raven Beak: Sephiroth is a bitch compared to me!
[3:14:20] <marvel877> don't run
[3:14:22] <Make_me_mad> Why does the entire chat feel it necessary to yell boss fight spoilers after the first time the attack is seen?
[3:14:25] <+Havictos> @fcKurl Because one wing is useless and he seems the type to get of something if it's no use to him
[3:14:25] <+McDerpus> first he made you, his daughter, then he made his sun
[3:14:25] <%greencapps> if you do damage first phase and then morph ball his big aoe you can get a longer parry
[3:14:27] <+LastHazzerd> Bird bat
[3:14:27] <Treasure_Vault> There's a checkpoint before phase 7
[3:14:29] <Kain5707> PHD Vampire
[3:14:35] <%spitelite> you can power bomb the sun
[3:14:37] <%RealThiele> chat being bad at the backseating atm
[3:14:38] <%AncelDeLambert> man, I beat him without using PBs, LUL
[3:14:39] <+LastHazzerd> let me spend points to backseat
[3:14:39] <thisisacoolguy> Chat really loves backseating the final boss huh lol
[3:14:39] <greatspaceadventure> my first actual thought in this fight was "this is the first Dracula battle ever in Castlevania" genuinely
[3:14:41] <+Redpointshine> Raven Beak is the coolest Mteroid villain since Ridley
[3:14:41] <fcKurl> @fcKurl but it hurts to rip it off and it would look cool if he left it
[3:14:44] <+tsmasher1000> One of the coolest things is that the initial fight between Samus and Raven Beak has the cutscene show how to fight him
[3:14:53] <fcKurl> you can walk with 1 wing :)
[3:14:54] <%scaryboisupreme> I wish samus had a cool glowy shield like that
[3:14:55] <lonosis47> STOP BACKSEATING
[3:14:56] <AzaroRequiem> that parry was bs lol
[3:14:58] <+piecks_butt> PATROID
[3:15:03] <%scaryboisupreme> NICE
[3:15:07] <+Namillus> @fcKurl It's so much sicker to rip it off BECAUSE of the implied pain
[3:15:10] <%RealThiele> SPLAT
[3:15:17] <%polothegreatest> psaGib psaGib
[3:15:18] <%InternetShis> OH THAT PUNCH
[3:15:18] <ape_hawk> NEW Dan Ryckert Lore: He once thought the moon was only 7 miles away.
[3:15:28] <%king_wragles> Does Pat know he's not hurting him?
[3:15:30] <marvel877> @scaryboisupreme she did, in Samus Returns. this guy's literally use it right now.
[3:15:34] <shieldanvil> @fcKurl but then squenix would come for copy right infringement
[3:15:39] <+HakureiIllusion> Don't stop firing missiles during the parry moments, they can last longer
[3:15:40] <Kain5707> no phase skip FeelsBadMan
[3:15:42] <%scaryboisupreme> OH RIGHT
[3:15:45] <%AncelDeLambert> can you just hit him with normal blaster fire to make him do the parry faster, or does it have to be missiles?
[3:15:46] <%scaryboisupreme> IT IS HYPER AMOR
[3:15:47] <+harrisboe> @fckurl yeah but I’m a fight having just one wing would weigh you down
[3:15:49] <An_Armed_Bear> nooo
[3:15:51] <%scaryboisupreme> SHIT
[3:15:53] <+NeonLight> B I R B
[3:15:57] <+tsmasher1000> Because he wanted to show he's cooler than Sephiroth
[3:16:01] <$EsotericOdyssey> aw hell yeah final boss time
[3:16:02] <An_Armed_Bear> he's too good to see the cool thing
[3:16:03] <%InternetShis> BIRD
[3:16:06] <Blank9> I love that she copies his gut punch for that phase transition
[3:16:07] <Azathotic> @AncelDeLambert Beams work but missiles hit harder
[3:16:09] <$EsotericOdyssey> just got back
[3:16:13] <blackjack8182> BIRD
[3:16:18] <%RealThiele> i mean once you lose a wing the other is just a big target
[3:16:22] <Louie_Salmon> @anceldelambert Regular shots work too. Missiles are basically infinite though
[3:16:22] <+Bluydee> dissidia taught me 1 wing makes you able to destroy the solar system
[3:16:25] <+Namillus> @Blank9 "Learned it from watching you, dad!"
[3:16:28] <%polothegreatest> This aint KH LUL
[3:16:30] <m1a_gunner> bird is the word
[3:16:31] <+T4silly> Shove those missiles up his cloaca!
[3:16:35] <%AncelDeLambert> although, honestly in phase 1, I just dodge until he does the parry
[3:16:44] <%MegadBlitz> @EsotericOdyssey welcome back take a seat? we at birdgil now
[3:16:47] <%emMmDeeKay> BIRDGIL FOR NICK All Stars
[3:17:01] <%AncelDeLambert> huh, you CAN'T bonk him...
[3:17:17] <$StrawberryPantsu> Oh that actually hurt him
[3:17:18] <Calek> powerbomb certainly hurts him who knows how much though
[3:17:18] <Louie_Salmon> That does do damage
[3:17:20] <%greasypete00> that probably does a good bit of damage
[3:17:22] <%SinnerEbru> oh this is birdgil huh
[3:17:24] <+NeonLight> I do like that this boss makes you know all your movement tech to do well
[3:17:24] <BiostormEX> that did hurt him
[3:17:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> I WOULD 10000% be behind him as a smash character
[3:17:45] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, the question is down to how much damage the PB does on him and is it a viable dps strat
[3:17:48] <+tsmasher1000> This final boss is like a final exam boss. You gotta know how to use everything in the game to win
[3:17:48] <%scaryboisupreme> You got it this time Pat
[3:17:49] <%hereiam407> You got this
[3:17:57] <+T4silly> Damn, wanted to see that again.
[3:17:58] <+TombstoneTTromboners> YEAH!!!!

[3:18:05] <+NeonLight> **power bomb the sun!!!**
[3:18:05] <RaimeTT> you can do that??????
[3:18:06] <%RealThiele> RIP THE SUN
[3:18:07] <ataxia72> this is the run
[3:18:10] <$EsotericOdyssey> what did pat think of the part where he tore his wing off
[3:18:13] <%InternetShis> YOOOOOO
[3:18:15] <+gustavozxd> I didn't know you could power bomb that shit
[3:18:16] <blackjack8182> COME ON PAT
[3:18:17] <$8BitDsx> WHAT, NUKE THE SUN!?

[3:19:42] <SunsetJack> Black hole takes just 4 missiles yes
[3:19:43] <%Mr_Pylon> try shooting bird with gun
[3:19:45] <+zoopbooploop> It's so damn cool that in one game  and one fight they gave Samus a cooler foil than Dark Samus

[3:19:47] <%AncelDeLambert> oh okay, good to know
[3:19:55] <+T4silly> in the GUTT
[3:19:57] <Blank9> he doesn't put the shield back on while flying
[3:19:58] <Saltmeisterr> ice missiles are more dps than storm
[3:20:04] <Saltmeisterr> but u have to hit him
[3:20:05] <%king_wragles> @SunsetJack Where the fuck were you when I was fighting him?
[3:20:13] <%king_wragles> That's WAY easier than what I did lmao
[3:20:16] <%hereiam407> I hope Pat gets to see the 'come over here' gesture on hard mode
[3:20:23] <miucsa51> Metroidvania
[3:20:27] <%greasypete00> he cant be hurt while golden
[3:20:27] <Zaphire_Saucypants> spam beaming during the second phase helps save on risk as far as health goes.
[3:20:29] <+LastHazzerd> puting the vania in metroidvania
[3:20:29] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, I would always do the full five storm points on the black hole
[3:20:31] <Saltmeisterr> yeah gold is invuln
[3:20:33] <+PA_august> The D on my grave stands for Dracula
[3:20:34] <+TaurusOxford> @hereiam407 he does that on normal too.
[3:20:34] <An_Armed_Bear> I think he'll get to see it here
[3:20:37] <SunsetJack> @king_wragles I didn't know until later too :(
[3:20:39] <mr_mister0> @FollowDatDolphin only four, and you dont need to wait
[3:20:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> 1000% confidence in pat
[3:20:43] <+TungstenViper> guys, is this Pat's first 2D metroid?
[3:20:47] <Shwepie> Storm Missiles do less damage per missile than Super/Ice Missiles.
[3:20:50] <Azathotic> I think everyone spams Storm Missiles because it looks stronger
[3:20:56] <%hereiam407> @TaurusOxford Pat won't let it happen, he's too good
[3:20:57] <fcKurl> i had no idea the storm missiles were good for bosses so i beat everything just spamming ice missiles
[3:21:03] <%hereiam407> There we go
[3:21:03] <Kain5707> Pog
[3:21:04] <Azathotic> YEYEYE
[3:21:05] <+TombstoneTTromboners> love that so much

[3:21:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> so cool
[3:21:14] <%InternetShis> Yeah
[3:21:15] <redwidow1358> YO
[3:21:16] <%emMmDeeKay> BODIED
[3:21:17] <Shwepie> @TungstenViper He played Super but hated how it controlled and gave up, beyond that nothing.
[3:21:18] <$StrawberryPantsu> GETS THE WALLSPLAT
[3:21:18] <+Pachi3000> big dickus
[3:21:19] <+zoopbooploop> YEAH IT'S THE COOLEST PARRY
[3:21:19] <+LastHazzerd> he's LEARNING
[3:21:20] <+KingNoodleWalrus> DID HE JUST DO A "COME AT ME BRO"????
[3:21:20] <+ReiDuran> BIPSON
[3:21:20] <jorniev> ADD THIS GUY TO SMASH
[3:21:21] <marvel877> @TungstenViper kinda, he tried Super years ago, but hated the jumping.
[3:21:22] <+Kharinite> bruh
[3:21:23] <%InternetShis> SHCUM
[3:21:26] <+Rekinsinn> @TungstenViper first he's played to the end I think
[3:21:28] <ToneBacas> he even waits
[3:21:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> BIRDGIL FOR FUCKING SMASH
[3:21:31] <+T4silly> Yep, his Come At Me Bro phase.
[3:21:32] <$EsotericOdyssey> MF TAUNTS YOU AND YOU *GOTTA* GO OVER THERE AND PARRY HIM
[3:21:36] <+harrisboe> RAVEN BEAK FOR SMASH 6
[3:21:37] <%emMmDeeKay> WE don't call him BIRDGIL for nothing
[3:21:42] <Blank9> the kiryu taunt
[3:21:46] <%InternetShis> PUT RAVEN BEAK IN SMASH
[3:21:48] <+Renewed> Smash is finished LUL
[3:21:49] <redwidow1358> If you never approach for the taunt he literally just fucking stands there unamused and it's great. I love his attitude in this fight.
[3:21:50] <+TungstenViper> oh ok, thanks guys.
[3:21:52] <%greencapps> one storm point is the same ammount of damage as one super missle and uses up 3 times the ammo
[3:21:58] <%jyeowa> SHOW ME YOUR METROIDIVATION
[3:21:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> PERRY WITH THE CONFIRM
[3:22:00] <%hereiam407> Very cool
[3:22:03] <%hereiam407> Very Bird
[3:22:06] <redwidow1358> RAVEN BEAK FOR SMASH
[3:22:07] <ToneBacas> it's a pretty good fight
[3:22:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah but when you got 200 missiles you don't care about ammo
[3:22:18] <+tsmasher1000> Pretty sure this guy is the strongest warrior in the universe in Metroid (or at least thus far that we've seen)
[3:22:18] <%InternetShis> @renewed Fine, then the Smash when the next console comes out
[3:22:19] <Azathotic> Speedruns of this fight gonna be INSANE
[3:22:23] <Blank9> he's so much cooler than ridley
[3:22:25] <+harrisboe> Best goddamn fight in the entire series
[3:22:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Raven beak 10000% for smash
[3:22:34] <%greencapps> I mean he ran out last try
[3:22:34] <Louie_Salmon> @greencapps Yeah but homing tho
[3:22:36] <Saltmeisterr> after phase 1 missiles are better dps pat*
[3:22:36] <%greencapps> lol
[3:22:43] <+KingNoodleWalrus> styling on him with those cheeky wave blasts, damn
[3:22:45] <+tsmasher1000> Raven beak definitely the sickest mofo ever
[3:22:46] <%greencapps> but just aim tho
[3:22:48] <%hereiam407> @Blank9 Is this a sort of Ridley surrogate?
[3:22:48] <ToneBacas> there's a parry move you can do in this flight phase, right?
[3:22:48] <+Ardailec> Berdly heard you only played mobile games.
[3:22:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ridley is a bitch compared to birdgil
[3:22:56] <+the22cstomp> smash players dont deserve raven beak tbh
[3:22:59] <+SaintValiance> @greencapps Yeah, but you get up to 5 to fire at once, and they you don't have to aim them
[3:23:00] <%InternetShis> We need a 4th Metroid rep, and Raven Beak is perfect
[3:23:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt BIRDLY GREW UP AND IS NOW KICKING YOUR ASS
[3:23:04] <Azathotic> @tsmasher1000 In terms of ability yes, but Metroid Prime and Mother Brain are stronger in that they need weird bs to kill them
[3:23:06] <+Renewed> 100 missiles up his cloaca
[3:23:15] <Saltmeisterr> after phase one he gets a 3x damage reduction against beam
[3:23:21] <%hereiam407> Going strong
[3:23:22] <%emMmDeeKay> This what Berdly thinks he looks like
[3:23:32] <Kain5707> these guys need to remake Zero Mission
[3:23:35] <FollowDatDolphin> @greencapps easier to pull off storm missiles while moving. set and forget
[3:23:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @emMmDeeKay only with nipples
[3:23:49] <%greencapps> They're useful but there's a lot of times you're better off just pumping him full of supers cause of how long storm takes to charge
[3:23:50] <SaltyAzteca> 69 AGAIN
[3:23:55] <Saltmeisterr> @Kain5707 remake remake?
[3:23:58] <%InternetShis> Weeee~!
[3:23:59] <BiostormEX> 69 nice
[3:24:02] <+NeonFishFace> god this phase
[3:24:08] <+HakureiIllusion> Zero Mission and Fusion still hold up super well, they don't need remakes.
[3:24:09] <%hereiam407> Here we go!
[3:24:10] <%InternetShis> NO WINGED ANGEL
[3:24:10] <%greencapps> when you're moving yea
[3:24:23] <%hereiam407> Zero Mission feels good still
[3:24:26] <+tempestzephyr> stuffed
[3:24:26] <%greencapps> use storm
[3:24:28] <redwidow1358> @hakureiillusion I will disagree tbh
[3:24:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> IMAGINE IF SEPHEROTH RIPPED OFF HIS OWN WING
[3:24:29] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 yea why not and honestly Super and Fusion
[3:24:30] <%jyeowa> THAT GUT PUNCH AND WALL HITTING is SO anime
[3:24:34] <%AncelDeLambert> yep

[3:34:41] <SaltyAzteca> ANTI GOBBO TECH
[3:34:41] <+NeonLight> you can also just start new game on that file
[3:34:42] <Shwepie> You can start a new game from the same save file.
[3:34:43] <%tank7013> If you want to keep gallery progress you have to save over the file. It's weird
[3:34:43] <mr_mister0> WELCOME TO METROID
[3:34:43] <Spudmeister9000> cant believe you just stole that save file
[3:34:45] <%solracc25> Goblin Slain

[3:34:54] <KingJackel> start a new game on the cleared file. That way you keep the galery unlocks
[3:34:54] <Kain5707> Pat whats your rating on it?
[3:34:56] <Aeroallways> normal and hard have different rewards, you can just start a new game on the same file and keep your gallery rewards
[3:34:56] <JacknZack27> You actually want to start hard on the same save file
[3:34:56] <%MegaXZerolegends> You can start a new game in the file. Only way to unlock all ending images
[3:34:57] <+Take_2_shots> Let's you skip cutscenes

[3:36:24] <%Tearonex> why can't Metroid Crawl? but for realies now
[3:36:24] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Samus was the friend we made along the way.
[3:36:24] <%GustauveVIII> WAS DREAD NINTENDO'S VERSION OF DOOM?

[3:36:25] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Dread is an anagram for Re-Dad
[3:36:26] <cthulu_fearlock> the true dread was the friends we made along the way
[3:36:26] <doggieo> The next game will be sweet (not Prime)
[3:36:26] <%AncelDeLambert> not really, this is the last game of the timeline
[3:36:27] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> she's part human. part bird, part metroid, part x
[3:36:27] <SunsetJack> @patstaresat Ending unlocked by beating the game, under 8 hours and the last under 4 for each difficulty.
[3:36:27] <%hereiam407> Metroid can't crawl
[3:36:27] <hbkman24> Metroid = Ultimate Warrior = Samus
[3:36:28] <deejay782> its at the very end of the timeline
[3:36:28] <Kain5707> its the last one
[3:36:29] <+Namillus> No timeline shenanigans, this is the "latest" game timeline wise
[3:36:29] <%doc_ock_rokc> PAT this is the END OF THE TIMELINE
[3:36:30] <ohno778> Federation wants her asshole
[3:36:31] <%InternetShis> Metroid is Baba
[3:36:31] <deejay782> right after fusion
[3:36:32] <%Mr_Pylon> Isn't Dread the latest in the timeline?
[3:36:33] <hollumdusk> now link needs to become Zelda
[3:36:33] <%scaryboisupreme> Prime 4 has to take place after this
[3:36:34] <+attoram> Dread is the end of the timeline as of now
[3:36:34] <+ReiDuran> Raven Beak is a really cool final boss.
[3:36:35] <librettodude> Prime 4 is gonna be nutty
[3:36:35] <%JoshManVGH> How DREADful
[3:36:35] <+McDerpus> you know Ellie, we really were, the Metroid Dread
[3:36:35] <%rekinom> I think Metroid is a pretty cool guy
[3:36:35] <+zoopbooploop> It's at the end of the Metroid timeline, fortunately
[3:36:36] <Treasure_Vault> Waiting for the Link Zelda fusion
[3:36:37] <%ScrapKingKeita> @PatStaresAt how much do you wanna bet that the next metroid game will have your powers reset because your suit is no longer compatible with her fucked up Septic Tank DNA
[3:36:39] <%Dova573> Or Metroidssy?
[3:36:39] <%Kiyosuki> Also Green Samus
[3:36:40] <+Geronimo9037> fun fact this is the first Metroid where you dont start the game from samus ship

[3:36:48] <%MegadBlitz> i still cant believe this game was announced and released in the same year!
[3:36:49] <%InternetShis> Well she was de-Metroided by the X
[3:36:51] <TheGameGuner> This is the current END of the timeline how is that
[3:36:52] <%spitelite> Samus is a weird human/bird/parasite/other parasite freak
[3:36:52] <LoneFonte> and thats how they can still use that name being obsolete :)
[3:36:52] <%AncelDeLambert> she owns
[3:36:53] <+harrisboe> No timeline shenanigans, this is the last game chronologically
