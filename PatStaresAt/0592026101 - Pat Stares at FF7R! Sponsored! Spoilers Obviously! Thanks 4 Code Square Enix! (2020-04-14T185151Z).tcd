[0:20:18] <Too_Much_Nukie> Plague has a lot of issues with the story of FF7R. He does not appreciate the shitty timeghosts.

[0:26:07] <+amiroodude> Yeh thats true
[0:26:08] <derap41> Like how Americans count one century ahead
[0:26:09] <%UW_Duncan> its possible to be days old and 2 years old
[0:26:09] <%spiritofmojave> NO?
[0:26:09] <bardicfire> Japan does it too
[0:26:10] <%ringabal> IS it like when mothers call their kids 432 months old?
[0:26:10] <SkyPirateArcane> Eh that makes sense I guess, just start at 1 instead of 0
[0:26:10] <%Verd_254> that is what you took
[0:26:12] <%aishman> OH WOW IT'S SUPER TRUE
[0:26:13] <KaliasTV> Birthdays are dumb anyway
[0:26:14] <+CelioHogane> THAT'S REAL, a newborn can be 2 years old in South Korea!
[0:26:16] <+Dumple_Roe> Taste like bullshit to me
[0:26:16] <+stranglersthemsoftly> stranglersthemsoftly subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[0:26:17] <Stubin83> that's not how time works.
[0:26:17] <%Andrizzleton> no it doesn't
[0:26:18] <@mothmandraws> "im on my 2nd year" "im on my 28th year"
[0:26:18] <+exiled_blood> me?
[0:26:19] <%aishman> I just googled it.
[0:26:19] <Nupinoop296> EMLO
[0:26:22] <+arancet> instead of "1 year old" think of it like "your 1st year"
[0:26:22] <%logoth_> Koreans are aged in cycles, like omikron
[0:26:22] <MSN04_Sazabi> In the olden days you were as old as however many winters you survived
[0:26:22] <+justianxix> Didn't japan used to have something like that?
[0:26:23] <Shishi1205> elmo
[0:26:24] <ashuckel> sounds like bullshit
[0:26:26] <%medusasghost> psaPorgmo psaPorgmo
[0:26:27] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat That is 100 percent real
[0:26:27] <$GrugManGetAngryInside> Vietnamese Birthdays are the same as S. Koreans.
[0:26:28] <+Remery_> But the day in which i was poop out of my mother is special
[0:26:28] <ardbart> Kitten arise
[0:26:29] <Calern> watch out for south korean 18 year olds then
[0:26:30] <+some_brave_apollo> they also have an age of consent of 19 to account for that
[0:26:33] <xeros720> that makes a lot more sense why new years is such a big deal over there
[0:26:33] <%Ancopro> woaa
[0:26:38] <%GoopyEuclid> Pat it’s super true but they celebrate bdays
[0:26:38] <%spiritofmojave> Everyone is a New Year's baby?
[0:26:40] <vivaldiva> south korea is just weird all-round
[0:26:40] <@mothmandraws> think of age like video game levels pat
[0:26:40] <%Aeoneth> No they still do, but in general they don't ask how old you are, but rather they ask what year you were born in
[0:26:41] <%zeif00> NO PDA ON STREAM PLS

[0:26:41] <bardicfire> Japan still does that too

[0:26:44] <+ALazo> Can the rest of the world convince them to not?
[0:26:44] <Longerbone_ghm> Japan is not like that, ya'll tripping
[0:26:45] <DeoxysPrime> South Korea is also the country that believes in Fan Death, so...
[0:26:45] <derap41> Same as how Americans count the centuries
[0:26:46] <+leondatwani> It is apparently real
[0:26:46] <braincraft> Doesn't that mean that a Korean born on Christmas is one week old when they're 2?
[0:26:49] <%Typhaeon> South Koreans probably think arrays start at 1
[0:26:51] <unstablebeast19> WALL MARKET TIME BABY!

[1:07:26] <%Aeoneth> @megamirk Nope they all carry upward with the new upgrade system. Hardedge is the best Physical Attack weapon, Buster is general purpose/balanced, and [Redacted] is the best Magic weapon for Cloud

[1:07:46] <%Drizzydre116> BIG NUMBERS
[1:07:46] <42nfl19> HARD EDGE
[1:07:49] <+Firgof> Hardedge is literally 'fuck magic, give attack DPS'
[1:07:49] <%KasiCrafter> Number go BIG UP.

[1:07:57] <%AllenDeadman> BIG NUMBER
[1:07:57] <%BoomerUnchained> Big Number Edge
[1:08:00] <%JohnAtDawn> Hard Edge has the highest attack and nothing else
[1:08:03] <+ScrapSentinel> tangySmug big fuck off sword tangySmug
[1:08:03] <%Drizzydre116> all gas no breaks
[1:08:09] <%valkuma> @PatStaresAt yeah hardedge has the highest #'s of the entire game. its like 10-15 more stats than the others.
[1:08:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @JohnAtDawn Character also has base attack in addition to the blade, the percent affects the final overall sum of the stat
[1:08:17] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> Honey but materios

[1:55:55] <%optimasmaximas> @Meow0369 ye
[1:55:58] <%MasterTonberry23> Anyone else thing even the combat feels sorta Yakuza? Your regular moves do scratch damage and are really just there to build up your heat gauge, which does the real damage
[1:56:01] <%Keyd00d> use that ATB
[1:56:03] <%chiluzza> "this is too easy" oh man i cant wait for the final fight

[2:01:20] <%LandOfTheWay> relax chat, he can find out for himself so long as he saves
[2:01:20] <%Meow0369> If he doesn't unequip the fight is lame and shitty
[2:01:26] <%spiritofmojave> It's fine to say that really, backseat but eh
[2:01:28] <%alucard929> Do you get enough SP to fill everything out, or do you have to pick and choose what you want?
[2:01:30] <%hzealot> hey chat. here's an idea let him play the fucking game without backseating 24/7. if he dies he dies its not like you lose progress
[2:01:32] <%j0ustar> I'm pretty sure he knows what's coming
[2:01:32] <@StridentSong> Well he can fail the fight and learn from it then.

[2:10:53] <%tusk102> @BigCoffee saving it for when they're close to staggering
[2:10:55] <%Meow0369> He's pat that's why
[2:10:57] <%spiritofmojave> he's just saving it id imagine
[2:10:58] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[2:11:00] <%Esparsenior> How is this not the best fight in the game. HOw do you top THIS?
[2:11:04] <%Shockrates20XX> this is the house of god
[2:11:05] <%starotter70> @tusk102 Oh no, I just meant the commentary variety
[2:11:07] <%SaiyanShoto> Because you have to save the summons
[2:11:07] <%marchums> AWE FUCK I gotta go get an eye exam in like 20 minutes so i might not see the whole fight or the stuff from after
[2:11:07] <%EuropanLamprey> Yes Pat, make sure Clouds head is a deep into the rocket as you can get it LUL

[2:11:20] <%JumbleJams> CHOCOBOOOOO
[2:11:20] <%tusk102> he's probably saving the summon for when it staggers
[2:11:21] <%Valdorick> Hold chat, hold.
[2:11:23] <%Buzzard42> shoot it until it dies!
[2:11:25] <%prism_zet> That's why i said the commentators are the best here, all aspects are talked about haha
[2:11:27] <%rufus2k2> according to the lease they are
[2:11:28] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s wasteful summoning it right away
[2:11:31] <%optimasmaximas> guys they literally said to NOT backseat
[2:11:31] <%VritraReiRei> @BigCoffee he's waiting for a 3rd phase or when it's closer to death or something

[2:24:37] <%j0ustar> Time to grind psaGoblin
[2:24:37] <+reinbachthe3rd> reinbachthe3rd subscribed with Twitch Prime.
[2:24:40] <%Persona_EX> 10 levels overleveled tomorrow BET
[2:24:41] <%Keyd00d> Hell house confirmed male
[2:24:44] <%Meow0369> This fame and recognition makes it so weird that he's able to successfully hide his identify with nothing but a dress
[2:24:49] <%saynof> FOR HE WVMEN
[2:24:54] <%Pappajimbo> doing it for the vvemans
[2:24:58] <%Pompadourius> I do think that was the best way they could've done Hell House though. Better than giving him a random encounter/as a sidequest boss or something. On full display in all his stupidity.
[2:25:01] <%reinbachthe3rd> I can finally SPEAK.
[2:25:07] <%pupperpuzzlersupreme> So I've been grinding a little off screen
[2:25:10] <%j0ustar> Level 99 Cloud incoming
[2:25:16] <%Legato_Ambrose> It was beautiful
[2:25:18] <%Meow0369> I think max level is 50
[2:25:19] <%reinbachthe3rd> That boss fight was frickin' amazing.

[2:25:51] <+Remery_> DANCING
[2:25:52] <%Keyd00d> Make sure to do those fights before you leave Wall Market
[2:25:54] <%suikudo> already knows about the dancing
[2:25:55] <%Nope80808> FF7 Danicng all night
[2:25:55] <%tusk102> wow imagine spoiling the game chat Kappa
[2:25:56] <%Legato_Ambrose> Oh god I hope we get Tankceratops
[2:25:57] <%Roundelay11> Wait, did pat get spoiled on the dance?
[2:26:03] <%Esparsenior> What’s Honey Bee?
[2:26:08] <%tusk102> @Esparsenior an inn
[2:26:11] <%nanaki_ff14> Its in the trailer
[2:26:14] <%Pompadourius> Tankceratops as the sequel to Hell House in part 2 would be the best way to follow it up imo.
[2:26:18] <%nanaki_ff14> He hasnt seen the full dance
[2:26:23] <%floralkami> @roundelay11 it's in the trailer
[2:26:25] <%j0ustar> I get the feeling Pat will just be grinding the night away
[2:26:29] <%Legato_Ambrose> What should part 3's "ridiculous monster turned boss" be then?
[2:26:30] <ringabal> @Roundelay11 The dancing was teased in the trailers
[2:26:31] <%Meow0369> Was the dance in the trailer? I didn't see that and I'm thankful for that because that came out of NOWHERE for me
[2:26:34] <%reinbachthe3rd> psaGoblin
[2:26:49] <%tusk102> @Meow0369 it was briefly shown
[2:26:53] <%Nope80808> Imagine watching trailiers for anything?
[2:26:55] <%Pompadourius> Dance was in the trailer for like 2 seconds, yeah.
[2:26:56] <%Aeoneth> @Legato that weird pot thing
[2:26:57] <%nanaki_ff14> Just the end
[2:26:59] <%Meow0369> I only watched the 2015 original hype reveal
[2:27:14] <%spiritofmojave> Shame the trailers pseudo spoiled that then, I only saw screenshots/stills thank god
[2:27:16] <%Pompadourius> In the Hollow trailer IIRC. Which I couldn't skip because that song was incredible.
[2:27:23] <%chiluzza> did they leave cause paige offered a hand massage
[2:27:29] <%tusk102> @Meow0369 i've only seen what they discussed in the podcasts
[2:27:31] <%Legato_Ambrose> I dunno, I'm not sure the pots are stupid enough
[2:27:51] <%Nope80808> The entire collection of music is on sale i think its 7 disk for 77 dollerydoos
[2:27:59] <%Meow0369> Yeah the OST is 77 bucks
[2:28:05] <%Meow0369> Euro, yen and USD iirc
[2:28:07] <%Nope80808> No vynils tho
[2:28:10] <%tusk102> god i just tried to skip forward in the video thinking it was a VOD that i'd been catching up on
[2:28:11] <%floralkami> the parts that of Wall Market that were in the original game was shown off in the trailer. they weren't so much spoilers as they were confirmation for all the people who wanted to get "their nostalgia moments"
[2:28:23] <@StridentSong> It was in the trailers, yea. But don't be talking about it in detail please
[2:28:33] <%Aeoneth> @Legato_Ambrose What about the swimsuit woman
[2:28:41] <%Meow0369> Why people want vinyl I don't understand.
[2:28:49] <@SoFarFetched> Sound quality
[2:28:56] <%floralkami> sounds quality
[2:28:56] <%tusk102> @Meow0369 it's neat and nostalgic. also sound is good
[2:28:56] <%Legato_Ambrose> @tusk102 I've done that before, dude. Rarely get a chance to watch live
[2:28:58] <%Yummy_Nukes> @patstaresat paige might like the side quests they're pretty funny
[2:28:58] <%j0ustar> Because cool
[2:29:03] <%colouroftheiris77> Twitch is running like a pig for me today, anyone else?
[2:29:05] <%Roundelay11> It sucks that they put it in the trailer, I went in blind and loved every surprise second
[2:29:07] <%thetrashman_sc> it was me i defeated the hell house
[2:29:07] <%Meow0369> The sound is objectively inferior to digital
[2:29:11] <%rytyoung> I WAS THERE IN LIFESTREAM SPIRIT
[2:29:13] <%floralkami> digital compresses music into each other
[2:29:13] <%depressed_skeleton> *I* did it
[2:29:15] <%starotter70> Johnny's DAD!?
[2:29:17] <%Aeoneth> Or the Eagle Gun
[2:29:27] <%floralkami> @meow0369 it's not
[2:29:27] <%Pompadourius> I don't get physical music in general. Just inject the music directly into my computer.
[2:29:29] <%tusk102> @Meow0369 inferior maybe but it has a certain quality to it that digital can't reproduce
[2:29:30] <%This_is_Marco> I did it :)
[2:29:33] <%Aleate> THAT LADY T-POSED IN WHEN HE PAUSED, I SAW IT
[2:29:34] <%optimasmaximas> god chadley kills me everytime i see him LUL
[2:29:35] <%Legato_Ambrose> OH! The giant skeleton boat should be a boss!
[2:29:35] <%Nobrev> ive been considering getting a vinyl player
[2:29:41] <%reinbachthe3rd> I saw ENB do that Hell House fight with zero healing/item use. What a mad lad.
[2:29:55] <%Meow0369> You mean that it sounds grainy. Vinyl offers nothing digital can't reproduce. It's just nostalgia garbage fight me
[2:30:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> The skeleton boat and the russian nesting doll monster
[2:30:07] <%FoolsArcade> but he said he'd let you pass??
[2:30:09] <%Axellogic> yeah those alleys fucked with me too
[2:30:15] <%ringabal> He'll only let you pass if you join his DnD session

[2:30:46] <%AllenDeadman> wait.... IS THAT LULU'S VA?
[2:30:46] <%Roundelay11> It's cause you did all the sidequests
[2:30:47] <%ringabal> THE Cloud from Super Smash Bros Ultimate?
[2:30:47] <%Meow0369> He's cloud the wandering prostitute
[2:30:48] <%Nobrev> or meow hear me out maybe let people like what they like
[2:30:48] <%Legato_Ambrose> but nah, the snow lady will probably just be put in as-is without any fanfare
[2:30:59] <%Niney_Who> GHaha cum
[2:31:02] <+Remery_> More like Lulu's sister
[2:31:07] <%optimasmaximas> jesus fuckin christ this woman Kreygasm

[2:31:38] <%SH1NK1R0> Welp there that goes
[2:31:39] <%floralkami> @meow0369 that grain you're assuming comes from lack of proper care, like not wiping down the vinyl and needle before putting them on the player.
[2:31:41] <%This_is_Marco> handholding DansGame

[2:34:58] <%thenumber5point5> i sell high end AV... Vinyl can be nice, if you have a right set up for it .. but 99% of people buying vinyl do not want to spend the money on a proper 2ch analog set up to actuly take advantge of vinyl's uncompressed audio... what most people are hearing on the "vinyl is better" is in how mastering of audio changed and old stuff isnt pushing for loudness

[2:37:01] <%starotter70> Wow
[2:37:02] <%floralkami> yep
[2:37:02] <%collind99> Table textures
[2:37:02] <%Legato_Ambrose> wait, really?!
[2:37:03] <%DetroitSentai> There are SEVERAL things that decide what quests you get
[2:37:05] <%spiritofmojave> Yep, each of the 'kings' has a route
[2:37:06] <%nanaki_ff14> I didnt get this quest yeah
[2:37:07] <%GohanHitsugaya> Sort of
[2:37:09] <%realm_forge> Johnny Johnny! Yes Papa? Rescue Tiffa? No Papa!
[2:37:13] <%Axellogic> That explains why I dont remember this
[2:37:14] <%Keyd00d> Yeah this is new to me
[2:37:14] <%hzealot> its hard to describe
[2:37:15] <%Meow0369> Aren't there like 5 different sets of quests
[2:37:16] <%tweedler92> I only got the squat bros
[2:37:18] <%floralkami> you have to play again to find out
[2:37:24] <%nanaki_ff14> I got the Angel of the Slums
[2:37:24] <%floralkami> not even joking
[2:37:25] <%ImmaCanuck> ....
[2:37:27] <%hzealot> theres 2 sets
[2:37:27] <%Legato_Ambrose> Look at this fucker dance-talking
[2:37:31] <%bevyrage> this guy feels like zell
[2:37:32] <%prism_zet> only 2 sets
[2:37:33] <%Piemen99> Such a himbo
[2:37:33] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt one of the alternate quests is called "Shear's counterattack"
[2:37:33] <%Axellogic> but I swear I talked to johnny first
[2:37:33] <%reinbachthe3rd> LUL
[2:37:34] <%DetroitSentai> Every choice in wall market leans the quests you get in two different dirrections
[2:37:35] <%HotBloodedHero> Is that Hank/Mr Krabs
[2:37:38] <%prism_zet> sam/madam ones
[2:37:41] <%depressed_skeleton> dumdum
[2:37:42] <%Pompadourius> M and Sam apparently give you different quest routes, and talking or not talking to Johnny at the start gives you different stuff or whatever. Can't 100% on one playthrough apparently.
[2:37:42] <%realm_forge> It’s a dirty playboy from the 40’s
[2:37:43] <%Hasmeister96> Did he just struggle to say "inspiration"?

[3:10:51] <%starotter70> Yeeeea
[3:10:52] <%spiritofmojave> JUST a littleeee
[3:10:52] <%floralkami> @sgrim well that's good, but fast squats are legit horrible if you trying to gain actual mass and endurance. it's MUCH better to bring yourself down into a proper form and hold them for at least 2-3 seconds each so you can activate all the muscle groups in your legs.
[3:10:53] <%This_is_Marco> hit em with fire LUL

[3:15:58] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt depends on how big your party is
[3:15:58] <%hzealot> that one is for a good item

[3:16:18] <%Aeoneth> there are some unlocked later that let you bring 2 or 3 people

[3:16:20] <%Jp3g95> H U G E Q U E S T
[3:16:23] <%NopeBadguy> they're solo only for lb2, you missed aerith's earlier, so see if you can come down when she rejoins the party
[3:16:27] <%DetroitSentai> There are other fights, you just cant do them yet
[3:16:28] <%floralkami> @sgrim see, "heart problems." fast squats are good for doing cardio, and should be something you build up into jumping squats to get that explosive power factor. but for building mass, they will do more harm than good. you should try slow controlled paces every other day to build your strength and balance.

[3:20:42] <%floralkami> @sgrim trust, you can get a super hard, muscle building workout using bodyweight as well. weights should be used to build up weaker muscles that can't handle your body weight. Rule of thumb: Slow and steady builds mass, fast and explosive strengthens the heart, no matter what.

[3:55:20] <%ringabal> Dont worry about it
[3:55:21] <%honeyman18> For the SFM intro
[3:55:22] <%floralkami> they did
[3:55:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> they shrink
[3:55:24] <%BioHunter> they did take them
[3:55:25] <%Masamune195> they did take your weapons away
[3:55:26] <%DetroitSentai> They did, you just dont ever lose inventory in this game
[3:55:27] <%Ancopro> you can just do this for funsies
[3:55:30] <%furiousfurioso> they did it just lets you change stuff anyway
[3:55:30] <%FoolsArcade> you dont actually have your weapons
[3:55:31] <%Darkfire346> they could have just asked you to wait in the room
[3:55:31] <%mankeyfigh> no your equipment is gone
[3:55:32] <%Japanfreak2595> @XeroSigmaPrime joking
[3:55:33] <%MAX116030> Well the question is where he stoked the weapon
[3:55:42] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt talk to tifa a bunch
[3:55:43] <%mechslayer71> They did take them @patstaresat
[3:55:44] <%tallik44123> but what about the muscle orgie baths
[3:55:44] <%Hasmeister96> @RetroCop87 what about Club Sunshine?
[3:55:46] <%MAX116030> so far only cloud has long shirt
[3:55:48] <%SaiyanShoto> You don’t have your weapons
[3:55:50] <%ringabal> Say your prayors to the planet
[3:55:50] <%Gogogolem> The gas was to clean the slum smell of bitches.
[3:55:53] <%Keyd00d> nice
[3:55:53] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Don't look at me.
[3:55:55] <%cowardman93> Honey Bee Inn got so lavishly made so nobody could complain about them holding back on the weird stuff
[3:55:58] <+Remery_> So glad, now we get more FemCloud "art" on Twiiter
[3:55:58] <%Ancopro> smellovision
[3:56:01] <%Darkfire346> DONT LOOK AT ME PAIGE
[3:56:01] <%Townspoon> All these chat eyeballs...
[3:56:09] <@StridentSong> Keep the backseating to youself
[3:56:13] <%j0ustar> Paige wants 2D Pat
[3:56:17] <%depressed_skeleton> stinky paige
[3:56:18] <%Keyd00d> But the MAN ORGY BATH
[3:56:20] <%This_is_Marco> I feel like they doubled down on it
[3:56:20] <@SoFarFetched> It had to turn into sub mode because people couldn't behave.
[3:56:23] <%suikudo> Yea the gay orgy is gone
[3:56:24] <%Dragon_Batman> they knew they had to
[3:56:24] <%RetroCop87> I can't wait for the inevitable PC release which includes mods for the Honey Bee Inn scene
[3:56:25] <%Japanfreak2595> Square included the Black Jack and hookers
[3:56:25] <%NovaKnightmare> BRING BACK THE GANG BANG
[3:56:26] <%ringabal> Square going BIG HARD
[3:56:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Literally I feel like this game is perfect trasnlation and improvement to the OG
[3:56:31] <%StaceMcGate> But Cloud didn't get a muscular man massage
[3:56:32] <%WhereIsWill> they tripled down on the crazy
[3:56:33] <%sporeian94> I mean the gay orgy is gone
[3:56:33] <%patriotrenegade> cant wait for the "under the airship" scene
[3:56:33] <%Roundelay11> They didn't do the gym sauna scene though, so thats one thing that got cut
[3:56:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> I am looking at al 3 dresses Cloud can wear...I agree with the current dress as best dress
[3:56:36] <%nanaki_ff14> Deadly Dodge to Tifa just to look at it so sick
[3:56:37] <%Xenokhrist> they excised the Prez Shinra Sephiroth play thing
[3:56:40] <%Solid_Stro> @j0ustar Because she can silence him whenever she wants
[3:56:44] <%mankeyfigh> people will still complain, they're dumb, someone said the music remixes are all trash
[3:56:48] <%Andrizzleton> dodge
[3:56:50] <%Verd_254> "b-but cloud shouldn't know how to dance" doodSad doodSad doodSad doodSad
[3:56:52] <%JumbleJams> they had to sacrifice bath gang bang for dance minigame so it evens out
[3:56:56] <%Keyd00d> I kinda wanted to see Shinra doing the weird play too, but oh well
[3:56:57] <%j0ustar> @Solid_Stro oof
[3:56:58] <%Valdorick> He got a Dance with a man and an on stage make over though. I feel like this is a fair trade.
[3:57:01] <%Japanfreak2595> Honey Bee Innhas male hookers now
[3:57:12] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[3:57:15] <%spiritofmojave> Much better
[3:57:15] <%StaceMcGate> Honey Bee is a bisexual paradise now I suppose
[3:57:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> There are people who think the music sucks in this game compared to old FF7...
[3:57:16] <%NopeBadguy> synergy is alright for casters
[3:57:17] <+Remery_> I like Tifa's deadly dodge. Just more kicks
[3:57:22] <%Ancopro> we also got a sweet hand massage
[3:57:26] <%Owkono> lucky tifa
[3:57:26] <%Meow0369> @XeroSigmaPrime Those people are WRONG
[3:57:27] <%Keyd00d> The remixes have all been hot fire
[3:57:28] <%ringabal> YOU get a ho and YOU get a ho
[3:57:30] <%floralkami> they wouldn't put in the gangbang, that was literally sexual harassment
[3:57:31] <%Like51bears> Ay Pat, Tifa's Iron gauntlets do way damage.
[3:57:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> @XeroSigmaPrime tell theme to shut up...they are both good
[3:57:32] <%Valdorick> Those people are insane, Xero.
[3:57:33] <%Dragon_Batman> @xerosigmaprime those ppl are nuts
[3:57:36] <%NopeBadguy> I wish deadly dodge was better
[3:57:40] <%suikudo> This has MAJOR flaw. These dresses arent extra costumes
[3:57:44] <%Solid_Stro> Hooker Materia
[3:57:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Meow0369 Yup They desrved to be euthanized
[3:57:47] <%Hasmeister96> btw when's the stream ending?
[3:57:48] <%Roundelay11> vending machine in the back
[3:57:49] <%cowardman93> look under your seats, EVERYBODY gets a whore!
[3:57:53] <%spiritofmojave> @xerosigmaprime People hate better sound quality music I guess LUL
[3:57:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> BUT
[3:57:56] <+Remery_> I wish deadly dodge was it's own slot like Asses
[3:57:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> BUT!
[3:58:00] <%Keyd00d> If only there was a Lightning costume for Cloud to really hit that home
[3:58:01] <%DrSoulDraig> Aireth has a new weapon

[4:19:41] <%cherrysavestheuniverse> Id rcok aeriths dress only because i fucking love how cute the red jacket is
[4:19:41] <%Nupinoop296> what hte hell
[4:19:45] <%the38bandit> I like the red Jacket
[4:19:45] <%suikudo> Yea there is only one place the women are allowed to sit
[4:19:46] <%ringabal> Don Corneo can't even afford a sex bench
[4:19:47] <%StaceMcGate> might wanna heal up
[4:19:51] <%Legato_Ambrose> @conflict1914 This game is fine to play without the original, but you may be confused by a lot of references
[4:19:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @conflict1914 While it assumes you played the original it stands on it's own
[4:20:00] <%honeyman18> It's not a public bench that's for sure
[4:20:01] <%Keyd00d> psaWrong
[4:20:02] <%Solid_Stro> Paige wears dresses but doesn’t read
[4:20:04] <@mothmandraws> vincents pointy shoes are better
[4:20:07] <%Nupinoop296> her her AC outfit was good
[4:20:08] <%Valdorick> She had the best design in AC
[4:20:09] <%sporeian94> PAT CLOUD HAS BEEN WITH CORNEO FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES!!!!
[4:20:10] <%TehMud> The last time I wore a dress was back in college for an event with friends. Honestly felt free as a bird buuut they made me wear heels. Never again
[4:20:10] <%rontopronto> Paige is Jared 19
[4:20:12] <%yeknomlive> is it different from her dirge of cerberus design
[4:20:12] <%optimasmaximas> yuffie looks cool af in ac
[4:20:13] <%thetrashman_sc> kingdom hearts design PogChamp
[4:20:14] <%tiaramaki> Her Dirge outfit was a bit odd too
[4:20:17] <%Darkfire346> her Dirge of Cerberus design was cool
[4:20:19] <%suikudo> Paige hates words
[4:20:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @sporeian94 I am sure hes good
[4:20:21] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So, she's the anti-Belle
[4:20:24] <%vaporousTippler> Yuffie's old design has a SOLDIER shirt, because that's what she originally was meant to be.

[4:29:07] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt too bad tifa has ice attacks which he's strong to
[4:29:09] <%RPG_CHICAGO> ice fists not doing much...
[4:29:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Magic is still useful
[4:29:21] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt pat he's weak to fire you just ead it
[4:29:29] <%bevyrage> you can use magic for big damage but the stagger won't fill up as quick as normal
[4:29:33] <%floralkami> @mechslayer71 well, when you plan to create even bigger destruction to blame on low level terrorists to justify breaking treaty and starting another war, killing 50-80k people is just a cracked egg
[4:29:51] <%cowardman93> breakfast is served
[4:29:54] <%Keyd00d> carve those horns
[4:29:56] <%bluefooddye1> If only there was some giant glowing weak spot with its own healthbar laeStare

[4:30:23] <%mankeyfigh> poison
[4:30:32] <%rontopronto> This boss is one letter removed away from being an adorable little monkey with a red hat
[4:30:34] <%hzealot> hes resistant to fire!
[4:30:40] <%tusk102> @hzealot no hes not
[4:30:41] <%rontopronto> SUMMONING!
[4:30:41] <%Sir_stride> HELL YEAH
[4:30:44] <%hzealot> i know chat im meming from earlier
[4:30:44] <%mechslayer71> @floralkami that’s another thing that gets me; is it really believable to say that junk ass terrorists have the means to drop 1/8 of your city? Like, would people believe that?
[4:30:45] <%Keyd00d> no he hates fire
[4:30:48] <%tusk102> @hzealot in fact fire is his weakness
[4:30:56] <%Sir_stride> now its like a cock fight
[4:30:58] <%mankeyfigh> EVERYTIME
[4:30:59] <+Remery_> Lewd
[4:31:01] <%hzealot> literally meming from earlier when pat read weakness as resistance
[4:31:07] <%spiritofmojave> drill up the butt!
[4:31:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> IT'S LIKE THE TRAILER OH MY GOD
[4:31:17] <@mothmandraws> next patch ff14 allows your summons to be this size like bahamut
[4:31:26] <%bread_assassin> I don't think I ever dodged that pounce move when I fought him.
[4:31:28] <@mothmandraws> he dancing
[4:31:31] <%mankeyfigh> he's really gonna need to learn how to dodge Pounce
[4:31:32] <%spiritofmojave> @mothmandraws oh if only
[4:31:34] <%marchums> Pat really doesnt seem to like arcane ward
[4:31:45] <%Keyd00d> save that attack for when he's staggered
[4:31:47] <%marchums> Double attack spells are super nice
[4:31:55] <%MonsterEnvy> Arcane ward lasts pretty much the whole fight
[4:31:55] <%bevyrage> yeah you need to block that attack
[4:31:56] <%beepbeepbopbop> arcane ward is killer
[4:32:14] <%hzealot> thats another gameplay thing i hate is bosses will always focus the player controled character and its very annoying at times
[4:32:16] <%mankeyfigh> hellfire
[4:32:18] <%Rachet122> pat does know summons have really good abilities right?
[4:32:20] <@mothmandraws> Phase 2
[4:32:22] <%DetroitSentai> All on regen/cure i found to be way better than barrier
[4:32:28] <%optimasmaximas> god ifrit is so cool in this game
[4:32:34] <%SH1NK1R0> Why does he never use summon abilities. The whole party can use them which allows spamming
[4:32:38] <%beepbeepbopbop> True, but he was focused on healing
[4:32:42] <@mothmandraws> "ill pay you back" implies ifrit is on a wage, what would cloud pay ifrit
[4:32:43] <%mankeyfigh> arcane ward is great
[4:32:46] <%JohnAtDawn> HE FINALLY USED IT
[4:32:52] <%spiritofmojave> UH OH

[4:42:19] <%bevyrage> I find it interesting that these guys were just originally Kappa but the localization team went with the lovecraftian iteration because that's the closest version western lore had in lore at the time.

[4:45:00] <%bevyrage> oh cool you did
[4:45:03] <%WhereIsWill> remember how much material you'd have by this point in the original? like night and day
[4:45:03] <%Xenokhrist> Starshower is crazy strong
[4:45:07] <%Dragon_Batman> I think he learned it yea
[4:45:08] <%Jp3g95> MAXIMUM TIFA
[4:45:16] <%spiritofmojave> also i dont think starshower is interruptible
[4:45:26] <%beepbeepbopbop> It's got a startup though
[4:45:30] <%beepbeepbopbop> so you can get knocked out of it
[4:45:39] <%spiritofmojave> true!
[4:45:44] <%Firgof> Yep. If you can get through the first... two seconds I think it goes off no matter what
[4:45:49] <%SH1NK1R0> Dont forget that star shower beefs her next command

[4:46:32] <%mechslayer71> The ability for this weapon is god tier @patstaresat
[4:46:33] <%bread_assassin> That's just like a free turn.
[4:46:39] <%Firgof> It's never explained I don't think but Speed is move speed + ATB charge speed right?
[4:46:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Bruh
[4:46:47] <%beepbeepbopbop> Really now?
[4:46:49] <%tusk102> First time getting in trouble :(
[4:46:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> BECOME SPEED
[4:46:53] <%beepbeepbopbop> When you get haste though
[4:46:55] <%j0ustar> crank S P E E D
[4:46:55] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea speed is atb, I think it's in the intel stuff

[4:47:14] <%j0ustar> become one with SPEED
[4:47:19] <%hzealot> i think the combat is actualy the worst part with how spel casting and certain other things work, not to mention the uninterruptibles that you have to know exactly how to dodge or get fkd
[4:47:20] <%PanicSwytch> Gotta go Fath
[4:47:24] <%spiritofmojave> Haste plus refocus is probably amazing
[4:47:25] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL

[4:48:03] <%wsintai> unsubbed
[4:48:04] <%spiritofmojave> no
[4:48:04] <%bread_assassin> @mechslayer71 In terms of like DPS, I guess.
[4:48:05] <%Firgof> Her ATB charges so damn fast with those gauntlets upgraded if you control her
[4:48:05] <%SH1NK1R0> Nah. Cloud actually hits harder but tifa builds stagger faster and increases stagger damage
[4:48:08] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Feel shame

[4:48:49] <%Darkfire346> GREASY SWEET
[4:48:57] <+Remery_> Seeing all the poop juice fill up ruined him
[4:48:59] <%mechslayer71> @bread_assassin Yeah, she’s the glass cannon for sure. But she’s not as good for groups compared to cloud because cloud has the sweeping sword attacks. Star shot does do decent against tight groups tho
[4:49:01] <%j0ustar> Pat is piss, piss is Pat
[4:49:15] <%Yummy_Nukes> we need a yellow PISS emote
[4:49:17] <%beepbeepbopbop> Tifa doesn't have a parry either
[4:49:21] <%tusk102> sfhCRY
[4:49:21] <%Nobrev> atching pat stumble through trying to move materia around makes me NotLikeThis
[4:49:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> psaCaco_TK
[4:49:37] <%Firgof> It was a big revelation for me while playing that 'triple strike isn't triple strike' because it doesn't 'target three enemies'. Rather, Cloud *attacks* three enemies and whatever gets hit gets hit
[4:49:49] <%beepbeepbopbop> But man, that chi level stuff is such a nice addition to her play style
[4:50:01] <%Firgof> Making it an *amazing* move for 1 ATB if you're hitting a tight and open group
[4:50:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Man there was a fight later on that kicked my ass a bunch, wondering if he'll get there
[4:50:10] <%beepbeepbopbop> Oh that one
[4:50:18] <%This_is_Marco> @Firgof thats true LUL although he does hit the same enemy 3 times if its the only one left
[4:50:19] <%beepbeepbopbop> 3 of those sahugin?
[4:50:21] <%mechslayer71> @firgof yeah, triple strike against a single enemy does more damage than braver easily, and tracks so it’s basically impossible to miss. So good
[4:50:23] <%beepbeepbopbop> Same here.
[4:50:30] <%Dragon_Batman> nah it's in the next area
[4:50:33] <%jessedouglas> favourite cloud ability chat?
[4:50:45] <%Firgof> I *love* the 'untyped mako triple strike'.
[4:50:50] <%Firgof> Shame you get it so late
[4:50:54] <%zetastriker> The counter is my favorite Cloud ability
[4:50:59] <%SH1NK1R0> Mine is a spoiler move
[4:51:09] <%Nobrev> my favorite ability for cloud is one that is on a later weapon so i wont spoil it
[4:51:09] <%Andrizzleton> did pat disrobe to pee?
[4:51:21] <%This_is_Marco> I just like spamming Cloud's stinger
[4:51:24] <%Malisin_Murder> psaUp
[4:51:27] <%tusk102> its only for the big poo
[4:51:27] <%Valdorick> You do it to poop.
[4:51:33] <%Firgof> Focused Strike is strong the whole way through, yeah.
[4:51:35] <%beepbeepbopbop> Builds stagger really well, that stinger
[4:51:37] <%tweedler92> Spoiler move is super good against spoiler boss
[4:51:39] <%Visorak6> What if you're taking a piss and shit at the same time
[4:51:41] <%j0ustar> I legit understood POWER SQUAT for a second
[4:51:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Pants were on the ground though, right?
[4:51:45] <%Firgof> Focused Strike + Tifa using Shooting Stars is amazing stagger.
[4:51:45] <%SaphronBlackbourne> Final Fantasy 13: Litning Returns
[4:51:48] <%Bane_Kaikyo> What if you are just tired?
[4:51:50] <%Daniel_Is_I> Peeing sitting down is fine, it's more comfortable.
[4:51:53] <%Nobrev> fuck you pat sitting to pee is comfy
[4:51:56] <%wmeldrum> or post coitus. cant trust the stream dude
[4:51:56] <%Dragon_Batman> Stinger and infinity end are like the best it feels
[4:51:59] <%wsintai> Sitting down to pee is FINE, especially if its your own damn toilet
[4:52:08] <%DetroitSentai> party
[4:52:15] <+Remery_> its really comfy to sit on a toilet ok?
[4:52:16] <%Like51bears> Starshower into Starshower is the most broken shit in the game.
[4:52:20] <%beepbeepbopbop> Remove divekick
[4:52:21] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Party" for status.
[4:52:24] <%Darkfire346> this party looks like Fuck, Marry, Kill on Hard Mode
[4:52:27] <%Firgof> *Starshower, not Shooting Stars
[4:52:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt sitting to pee is comfy and gives us an excuse to sit on our phone for half an hour
[4:52:28] <%Yummy_Nukes> does paige pee standing up?
[4:52:32] <%Dragon_Batman> Dive kick is just damage yea
[4:52:35] <%startstoprepeat> divekick is braver

[4:52:39] <%j0ustar> this chat understands psaUp
[4:52:44] <%zetastriker> More like Dive Kick is useless because charging chi or overpower are always better
[4:52:46] <%SH1NK1R0> Dive kick is tifa braver
[4:52:47] <%Firgof> Haste on Tifa is basically broken
[4:52:50] <%DetroitSentai> Dickkick combos well off of the uppercut
[4:52:59] <%DetroitSentai> Divekick
[4:53:03] <%beepbeepbopbop> Haste on Tifa is stupid great
[4:53:09] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL dickkick

[4:53:47] <%Dragon_Batman> What would it be?
[4:53:48] <@SoFarFetched> like side DLC?
[4:53:50] <%mighty_max_t> get off the stage!
[4:53:50] <%DetroitSentai> DLC for fighting in dresses

[4:53:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt that joke sucked, i'm unsubscribing from superbunnyhop
[4:53:54] <%Visorak6> Arena DLC bosses?
[4:53:58] <%skibadaa> The DLC will be the next game
[4:53:59] <%Andrizzleton> it will be $120 over the next 5 years
[4:54:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> unless its free DLC
[4:54:02] <%Firgof> A certain person having a solo mission set as a DLC would get me to drop some coin
[4:54:03] <%SH1NK1R0> Haste refous tifa the truest ora
[4:54:08] <%Dragon_Batman> It powers up the next
[4:54:09] <%JumbleJams> DLC: start game with dress
[4:54:10] <%ShichiNoBushi> Gilgamesh boss fight?
[4:54:14] <%Keyd00d> I'm waiting a year for the PC mods

[4:54:34] <+Remery_> Zest is a weird word
[4:54:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Isn't the game basically DLC?

[4:54:43] <%arcielardor> zest edition
[4:54:44] <%tusk102> DLC would be a horrible idea since they're gonna make us pay another 120-180 dollars for the rest of the game @PatStaresAt
[4:54:46] <%RyanTheRecluse> Started playing the hard mode yesterday and it doesn't mess around, didn't realise how much I relied on potions in the early game.

[4:56:11] <%SH1NK1R0> Remember when people said tifa looked bad? Lmao
[4:56:15] <%spiritofmojave> should get that checked out
[4:56:20] <%rumtumtugnutz> You always need your Asses materia
[4:56:26] <%GohanHitsugaya> Which Tifa? The left or right?
[4:56:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its all that extra WEIGHT she can put behind that punch

[4:56:41] <%Dragon_Batman> Fukin nuts right? @SH1NK1R0
[4:56:49] <%Yummy_Nukes> doodSweet doodSweet
[4:56:49] <%mechslayer71> An action game that was just Tifa and her move set would be cool on its own @patstaresat
[4:56:51] <%Firgof> Barret will be.
[4:56:58] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt whens the patch going out?
[4:56:59] <%Firgof> Oh boy will he be the Stagger-juggernaught
[4:57:05] <%zetastriker> Barrett can get crazy strong, he just deletes people when you press triangle
[4:57:13] <%zetastriker> Don't even need to control him. XD
[4:57:16] <%KasiCrafter> But, unfortunately, no one is a Hellhouse.
[4:57:20] <%Nupinoop296> power and money
[4:57:21] <%Darkfire346> I missed a couple streams, is Barret as "Mr T" ish as he was in the original?
[4:57:22] <%Yummy_Nukes> doodSmug doodDerp doodSweet
[4:57:23] <%tigerfang86> It's a SUPER EVIL endgame
[4:57:24] <%NovaKnightmare> SECTOR 7 2
[4:57:26] <%Keyd00d> Well...
[4:57:30] <+Remery_> But i like Barret's deadly dodge xD
[4:57:35] <%hzealot> its only something someone really evil would do
[4:57:42] <%tusk102> @Darkfire346 nope. he's more like a giant black preacher though its great
[4:57:48] <%valriot> Barrett tanks so hard
[4:57:50] <%floralkami> @darkfire346 you really should find out for yourself
[4:57:50] <%skibadaa> Shinra profits in moustashe twirling
[4:57:52] <%Darkfire346> Dude thats awesome
[4:57:53] <%weissguard> Can we appreciate how the materia on Cloud's weapon glow in the dark here?
[4:57:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cool lighting bro
[4:58:01] <%Dragon_Batman> Don't go secret hunting right now
[4:58:01] <%Dragovus> Wow this is dark
[4:58:03] <%mechslayer71> @darkfire346 No, now he’s small part Mister T, big part crazy black pastor, big part just charismatic and cool
[4:58:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> so... this story starts off fighting against the man. but then changes into SEPHIROTH
[4:58:07] <%SH1NK1R0> Notice how aerith stayed quiet for that?
[4:58:13] <j0ustar> I mean... there's actually a LOT to gain but hey
[4:58:14] <Darkfire346> TESTIFY BROTHER
[4:58:14] <+bread_assassin> I got a real weird bug when I played through this area, No matter how much I progressed through the level, Tifa & Aerith ran back to this office after every fight.
[4:58:20] <%Firgof> And then it changes into [CENSORED BY SPIRIT GANG]
[4:58:21] <%tusk102> @TurtlesAndTentacles sephiroth IS the man

[4:59:10] <%Darkfire346> am I the only one who heard "pissy"?
[4:59:12] <%hzealot> its the @PatStaresAt attack, putrid discharge
[4:59:16] <%Darkfire346> "pussy*"
[4:59:32] <%vaporousTippler> I think Zell did it, too.
[4:59:33] <%Dragon_Batman> Crab counter!
[4:59:35] <%InfamousShephard> crab battle
[4:59:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> CRAB PEOPLE
[4:59:50] <%Firgof> The Scissorclaw's Design Purpose is to make the player feel that Tifa isn't broken on receiving the Broke Gauntlets
[4:59:57] <%Dulzara> Does Pat know about Tifa's increase stagger thing? I went through like 80% of the game without learning that.
[4:59:58] <%sniffy77> this game is gonna take a long time to speedrun
[5:00:00] <%Nupinoop296> oooooh
[5:00:04] <%Darkfire346> Zell has My Final Heaven though
[5:00:06] <%Sir_stride> im upset that Shiva doesnt snap her fingers in this
[5:00:07] <%Dragon_Batman> Not familiar
[5:00:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> because Dancer is best dps
[5:00:19] <%MrBorisMakarov> rooSmug
[5:00:20] <%cvp5127> hit triabgle
[5:00:23] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> don't know a Shiiiva but I know a Sheeva. lol.
[5:00:27] <%Dragon_Batman> Her triangle builds the percent of stagger damage
[5:00:30] <%Dulzara> If you do unbridled power up twice, every Triangle move that Tifa does will increase the 160%
[5:00:37] <%couch_potato_Ed_Boy> The cat girl from Tekken 7 does a little hop thing when she does her Rage Art too
[5:00:40] <%Like51bears> Her Triangle makes stagger % go up
[5:00:44] <%Sir_stride> unbridled strength for triangle
[5:00:46] <%startstoprepeat> depending on your chi charge, you boost stagger damage more
[5:00:51] <%Dragon_Batman> it goes to 200 even
[5:00:51] <%optimasmaximas> yes
[5:00:53] <%GohanHitsugaya> Don't forget to assess enemys.
[5:00:53] <%Dulzara> So you can increas the 160% to like 200% if you spam the triangles
[5:00:54] <%Verd_254> chadly has a thing for 200% stagger
[5:00:56] <%chiluzza> stagger damage bonus
[5:00:59] <%Demirose41> Stagger % go up so more damage bonus
[5:01:00] <%Keyd00d> it goes to 300 even
[5:01:03] <%Dragon_Batman> Tifa
[5:01:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> Overpower makes it go up a bit more
[5:01:04] <%mankeyfigh> Stagger % is the multiplier for damage
[5:01:05] <%startstoprepeat> there's a cheevo for 300
[5:01:06] <%Demirose41> it goes above 200
[5:01:08] <%hzealot> trophy for 300
[5:01:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt when staggered, monsters take 160% more damage. she can increase the % with triangle and unbridled
[5:01:10] <%Dulzara> I went through the whole game not figuring that damn thing out
[5:01:12] <%Demirose41> spam
[5:01:14] <%Keyd00d> do it A LOT
[5:01:16] <%Firgof> *P u n c h*
[5:01:17] <%mankeyfigh> big UNBRIDLE
[5:01:20] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Big combo
[5:01:22] <%chiluzza> beat the shiit out of tbosses
[5:01:24] <%gaomachine> Fat Chocobo is a good target for it
[5:01:25] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[5:01:28] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt do combo
[5:01:30] <%startstoprepeat> she's not the only one that'll be able to do it
[5:01:32] <%Dulzara> Her Rise and Fall triangle does like 6 damn hits alone it so good
[5:01:50] <%Demirose41> tifa is just a monk from 14 she gets stacks of greeced lightning and can cash them out for stagger percent increases
[5:01:51] <%tigerfang86> DOGE
[5:01:53] <%Keyd00d> it WORKED
[5:01:57] <%hzealot> how do you get hte different triangle like rise and fall, omnistrike, and uppercut?
[5:01:59] <%Firgof> Section Skip
[5:02:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Would be weird to program I think
[5:02:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> I think it's Status materia that links with Poison.
[5:02:01] <%tusk102> we DO IT
[5:02:06] <%spiritofmojave> IT WORKED

[5:02:14] <%Firgof> hzealot: Her core first ability
[5:02:15] <%Demirose41> @hzealot higher stacks give the better attack
[5:02:15] <%tigerfang86> BUTT
[5:02:16] <%hzealot> ASS
[5:02:18] <%Dulzara> @hzealot You use uinbridled power and it buffs your triangle./

[5:02:28] <%toastybites> just jump over
[5:02:29] <%tigerfang86> NO SHUT UP PAT
[5:02:31] <%JoshyJ> NO SHUT UP
[5:02:32] <%mechslayer71> Tifa is the most fun to play IMO, but the fact that she’s a class cannon plus the fact that AI rushes the player controlled character the most makes it a bit tricky
[5:02:33] <%jessedouglas> shoutout to the crazy bastards who are going to inevitably speedrun marathon all parts of FF7R
[5:02:34] <%tigerfang86> THERES NO TIME PAT
[5:02:35] <%This_is_Marco> No Kappa

[5:02:41] <%Firgof> no. jumping. allowed.
[5:02:41] <+Remery_> only in cutscenes
[5:02:42] <%j0ustar> no shhhhhhh
[5:02:43] <%suikudo> and fall into shit
[5:02:44] <%spiritofmojave> Crisis Core Cloud could
[5:02:44] <%GohanHitsugaya> Yes! Yes they can!
[5:02:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> No you couldn't

[5:02:52] <%JoshyJ> id love to see you jump that pat :)
[5:02:53] <%Nupinoop296> brownLUL brownLUL
[5:02:53] <%bread_assassin> The FUCK you could
[5:02:54] <+Remery_> can't even jump in the game
[5:02:55] <%xShenzi> Cloud could just throw you tho
[5:02:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> pat you can't
[5:03:00] <%InfamousShephard> They can only jump vertically, not horizontally
[5:03:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> You'd try and then you'd fall and hurt yourself
[5:03:04] <%Dragon_Batman> baby
[5:03:05] <%freakintony> jump it ya nerd
[5:03:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> Cloud has Height but not range pat
[5:03:07] <%Malisin_Murder> Baby
[5:03:08] <%ergulor> Wind
[5:03:08] <@SoFarFetched> If that didn't follow up with a simpsons reference, I'd riot.
[5:03:10] <+cvp5127> LUL
[5:03:15] <$floralkami> @hzealot there are also moves that you have to hold or pause before mashing again
[5:03:21] <%Darkfire346> P R E S S U R E D
[5:03:22] <%j0ustar> oh no, a small gate, how will I EVER cross?
[5:03:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> Trombopoline?
[5:03:27] <%EuropanLamprey> "Five two and I dunk" - Patrick "I can't wait to leave the Earth's gravity" Boivin
[5:03:31] <%Keyd00d> Yeah and the enemies too
[5:03:31] <%Firgof> poor wererats
[5:03:33] <%tigerfang86> THEY HOT AND TOUGH
[5:03:43] <%Firgof> they keep showing up even later in the game and they're still *just as trash*
[5:03:47] <%PigGuy800> ice ice baby?
[5:03:49] <%Xenokhrist> cloud can super jump
[5:03:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> Muggsy Bogues could have made the shot.
[5:03:55] <%skibadaa> Wait till you see more Sahagins tho. They are for real.
[5:04:07] <%Firgof> yeah but that was Cutscene Cloud pat
[5:04:09] <%Dragon_Batman> Man Sahagins kick ass
[5:04:13] <%tigerfang86> clouuuuuud
[5:04:16] <%Hellarussian> plot needs to happen
[5:04:17] <%freakintony> he can fall not jump
[5:04:18] <%startstoprepeat> kids were around, they give him extra power
[5:04:19] <%Sir_stride> so not out of character
[5:04:22] <%suikudo> That was advent children cutscene cloud
[5:04:24] <@SoFarFetched> "Oh no the plot has suddenly made me feel more heavier so I can't jump"
[5:04:25] <%j0ustar> I hate small obstacle shenanigans.
[5:04:30] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Yeah, big jumps ruin narrative consistancy
[5:04:36] <%skibadaa> Not in this game they aint
[5:04:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> That're senior mutant kung-fu tortoises
[5:04:40] <%GohanHitsugaya> I believe the term for that is called ludonarrative dissonance.
[5:04:41] <%Firgof> Cutscene are the Limit Break for Cloud's Wuxia Powers
[5:04:47] <%RyanTheRecluse> just like death, jumping only occurs in cutscenes
[5:04:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> FF Games Cutscene characters are amazing. DMC games Cutscene characters are FUCKING UNSKILLED WIMPS
[5:04:59] <%Dragon_Batman> The bubbles!
[5:05:00] <%BubbaRands> BUBBLES NOOOO
[5:05:07] <%chiluzza> id pay good money for a saughalin to scream EVILAK
[5:05:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> CITIZEN SNIPS!
[5:05:27] <%Teh_Un> psaSleep
[5:05:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're fighting for their lives and Tifa still has time to flirt with Cloud
[5:05:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> @doc_ock_rokc for DMC...the gameplay is where the skills MATTER...cutscenes are for MUTHERRRR
[5:05:52] <%Firgof> I really think Cloud was a huge D&D nerd when he was still in the service
[5:06:00] <%Darkfire346> Mess with the crabbo you get the stabbo
[5:06:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Guardiansaiyan Well done
[5:06:01] <%Firgof> Because nobody else says 'Calling Lightning'
[5:06:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> Whatever Tifa is elementalling, it's not working on Mr. Snips
[5:06:16] <%Darkfire346> well yeah
[5:06:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Makes sense also
[5:06:20] <%Dragovus> as it should
[5:06:25] <%Firgof> The Road to 185 Magic Power, Pat. It begins now.
[5:06:37] <%Firgof> When Cure heals someone to Full for 4 MP
[5:06:44] <%Like51bears> and 300 attack Tifa
[5:06:47] <%Like51bears> fucking beast
[5:06:48] <%Savarro> I can't get enough of this combat. Its so good
[5:06:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @doc_ock_rokc thank you
[5:06:51] <%Dragon_Batman> But what if
[5:06:52] <%RyanTheRecluse> aerith is an absolute damage fiend in this game
[5:06:57] <%Darkfire346> 300ATK Tifa plus haste
[5:07:21] <%Firgof> You mean NoChillVergil, Darkfire?
[5:07:49] <%SaphronBlackbourne> NATALIA, THE SLUICE
[5:07:52] <%suikudo> Hard mode is awful
[5:07:53] <%Darkfire346> I mean Star platinum on red bull
[5:08:02] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Eh heh....good luck on hard mode
[5:08:03] <%WhereIsWill> the S A U C E
[5:08:04] <%Firgof> That's pretty accurate
[5:08:05] <%SH1NK1R0> Steadfast block is underated as hell.
[5:08:15] <%Firgof> Tifa was a fucking blur in the final fights in mine
[5:08:17] <%Dragon_Batman> I love steadfast block
[5:08:25] <%Dragon_Batman> It
[5:08:35] <%Dragon_Batman> It's really useful
[5:08:49] <%Firgof> Steadfast is the *most important* materia for Reno later imo
[5:08:49] <%Savarro> I felt dumb for not using steadfast block or first strike until the last few chapters
[5:08:50] <%valriot> Hard mode is interesting, different game honestly since a lot of the defensive stuff is so valuable
[5:08:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Aerith is like she is in ff7 proper....over powered at first
[5:09:03] <%Firgof> wait not Reno. Uh. the son rather
[5:09:08] <%Dragon_Batman> ATB boost
[5:09:22] <%Firgof> that jank physics
[5:09:26] <%Darkfire346> JANK
[5:09:28] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[5:09:31] <%Malisin_Murder> Looks like shit
[5:09:35] <%Jekado> how did it stay in place too?
[5:09:37] <%prism_zet> physics aint squares game
[5:09:38] <%j0ustar> P H Y S I C S
[5:09:42] <%Keyd00d> clod
[5:09:42] <%Savarro> Or someone like Tifa who constantly gets rocked
[5:09:42] <%Dragon_Batman> The sewers is where the junk belongs
[5:09:44] <%Firgof> the plot wills it, jekado
[5:09:44] <%PigGuy800> why would it going down make the water level come up
[5:09:45] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[5:09:51] <%RyanTheRecluse> steadfast block + prayer are essential for hard mode
[5:09:55] <%tusk102> no they'd never Kappa
[5:09:57] <%BubbaRands> Cloud is pretty hot
[5:10:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> They're both sad that Cloud was a prettier girl then they are
[5:10:00] <%SH1NK1R0> Block is better and it gives ahole atb. Also ai alway auto blocks if they arent acting.
[5:10:00] <%Wolfstriker121> SO HOT CLOUD IS!!!

[5:12:55] <%pynkdoe> cloud has been demoted to bitchboy
[5:12:59] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Nice job idiot
[5:13:00] <%Visorak6> Isnt tifa really strong
[5:13:00] <%bevyrage> for a moment i thought the staff was a gun
[5:13:01] <%JohnAtDawn> Cloud why did you try to run across instead of jumping?
[5:13:02] <%Zebroneath> That obsurdly fast
[5:13:03] <%tigerfang86> it's the sword
[5:13:04] <%Buzzard42> where's the time cops
[5:13:05] <%JoshyJ> sword es big
[5:13:06] <%InfamousShephard> it's all the sword
[5:13:09] <%Firgof> He's wearing like 7 huge swords
[5:13:10] <%danpc5> i mean his sword is really big
[5:13:10] <%prism_zet> its all sword
[5:13:14] <+Remery_> Cloud's sword is like 30lbs
[5:13:16] <%PigGuy800> Wait a minute That's not the right staff
[5:13:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Im now picturing tifa like Beyonetta at the end of B2
[5:13:17] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt he's carrying like 90 pounds of sword
[5:13:18] <%xShenzi> It's all his "sword"
[5:13:21] <%EuropanLamprey> That swords got to be 300 pounds at least
[5:13:23] <%j0ustar> Cloud activated skill: Fall from high places
[5:13:25] <%PanicSwytch> Where'd they get the pipe
[5:13:26] <%Dragon_Batman> There is a difference in carrying strength
[5:13:26] <%spiritofmojave> Cloud's bodyweight is 70% sword
[5:13:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Welp. No going back I guess.
[5:13:28] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PigGuy800 SSSH
[5:13:28] <%BubbaRands> 10% cloud 90% sword and fat ass
[5:13:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> boxes
[5:13:31] <%Nupinoop296> it's so dumb that people try and pit Tifa and Aerith against each other when they are getting along so well
[5:13:31] <%toastybites> okay what was the point of that
[5:13:31] <%optimasmaximas> @Remery_ definitely more
[5:13:34] <%VashyronM> Just
[5:13:35] <%rytyoung> ye
[5:13:36] <%JumbleJams> the sword weighs more than him
[5:13:36] <%suikudo> Yep

[5:13:53] <%yeknomlive> i've been noticing
[5:13:54] <%mighty_max_t> He is not talking theories
[5:13:55] <%Reaped_Psyche> @PanicSwytch It's Aerith's staff
[5:13:55] <%bread_assassin> Max is just out of the sewers.
[5:13:56] <%Buzzard42> EXTREMELY
[5:13:56] <%MrBorisMakarov> he suspects
[5:13:58] <%Firgof> They don't start *hitting you over the head with it* yet but that time is coming
[5:13:58] <%Masamune195> none at all
[5:13:58] <%tusk102> @floralkami it's 80 lbs
[5:13:59] <%Verd_254> He isn't letting on but he is pick up
[5:14:00] <%floralkami> he is having the same thoughts as you
[5:14:01] <+Remery_> I guess it just depends on the metal
[5:14:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> I bet Aerith is working for Shainra.
[5:14:05] <%yeknomlive> im literally right where you are and yeah same
[5:14:07] <%Dragon_Batman> He hasn't like gone with any theorys
[5:14:07] <%spiritofmojave> He ain't talking too many theories but suspect
[5:14:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> *Shinra
[5:14:10] <%Nupinoop296> @mechslayer71 brownLUL
[5:14:10] <+Remery_> but its heavy af
[5:14:14] <%Verd_254> He is trying not to spoil his own chat so he isn't letting on
[5:14:17] <%RyanTheRecluse> Nah he spent like an hour and a half on hell house yesterday
[5:14:18] <%realm_forge> YES YOU ARE
[5:14:18] <%SaiyanShoto> He suspects but he’s not really talking about it
[5:14:20] <%tigerfang86> the TINY BITS
[5:14:23] <%floralkami> @tusk102 yeah 80lbs is more like it
[5:14:25] <%tigerfang86> the SMALL BITES
[5:14:25] <%conradical> just got here. what chapter is he at?
[5:14:30] <%Keyd00d> 10
[5:14:31] <%ShawnTK_> 10
[5:14:32] <%bread_assassin> 10
[5:14:33] <%Firgof> Toad
[5:14:35] <%conradical> thx
[5:14:37] <%InfamousShephard> Can we get a Doughnut Cloud like how there is a Doughnut Drake?
[5:14:37] <@commanderclaw> We're in the sewers, so right now it's pieces of corn
[5:14:38] <%Visorak6> LITTLE BITS
[5:14:39] <%wsintai> @PatStaresAt Yeah he got fucked by Hell House for so long he didnt get any farther than you really
[5:14:40] <%KasiCrafter> He suspects TONS to the point where he doesn't want to say anything in fear of them being TOO correct.
[5:14:44] <%BubbaRands> Calling now Aerith is Zach in a wig
[5:14:47] <%za7az> Aerith was president Shinra all along?!
[5:14:48] <%toastybites> what a convenient bench
[5:14:49] <%Dragon_Batman> @conradical This should be chp 10
[5:14:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> @commanderclaw doodSmug I see what you did
[5:14:56] <%zeif00> The memberwine Aerith keeps sippin
[5:14:57] <%conradical> aw I missed honey bee?
[5:14:57] <%chiluzza> tiny sprinkle with tiny hats
[5:14:59] <%IntrepidEye> Actually now that I think about it he knows more than he lets on because the devs spoiled it a bit for him months ago
[5:15:01] <%ShawnTK_> @BubbaRands I would ugly laugh
[5:15:01] <@SoFarFetched> Some plot,as a treat
[5:15:02] <%floralkami> @patstaresat he actually knows the name of those ghosts, and you were a bit on the money
[5:15:05] <%tusk102> @floralkami man at arms made a replica and thats how much it weighed
[5:15:07] <%ShichiNoBushi> A zest of plot.
[5:15:08] <%Firgof> Gonna be a bit for more plot, sadly. Lots of neat little setpiece encounters coming up though.
[5:15:09] <%valriot> He can tell something is going on, but some of it is split between new suspicion and reworked old stuff just explained better
[5:15:10] <%Savarro> Hell House didn't wreck Pat as hard as Max did it?
[5:15:14] <%j0ustar> corn pops of information, if you will
[5:15:19] <%bread_assassin> @wsintai I think Abzu fucked him up more than Hell House.
[5:15:19] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> He's too hyped so he thinks any discussion will lead to a chat spoiler so I don't really hear him say much when I poke my head in. I prefer watching Pat
[5:15:22] <%Keyd00d> Pat beat it first try
[5:15:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> And then, Tifa's like, "I got your plot right here."
[5:15:29] <%DrFacilier> Nah Pat big strong gamer Hell House dead
[5:15:32] <%Nupinoop296> it's better that Pat doesn't say anything so Crazy Talk doesn't get him
[5:15:32] <%floralkami> @tusk102 oh yeeeeeaaaaah
[5:15:33] <%Dragon_Batman> Nah @Savarro Pat did it furst try
[5:15:36] <%SaiyanShoto> He doesn’t want to say anything because he doesn’t want to get the chat riled up and spoil him on accident
[5:15:38] <%SummonerMagno> If Pat makes enough predictions, at least one has to be kinda right
[5:15:40] <%Savarro> Nice
[5:15:53] <%Dragon_Batman> Yep
[5:15:53] <%Darkfire346> Man....as soon as the PC release hits, the porn markets going to crash
[5:15:54] <%Firgof> It's true tho
[5:15:54] <%tigerfang86> THE SHOTGUN
[5:15:58] <%tigerfang86> ITS THE TRUTH SHOTGUN
[5:16:02] <%Townspoon> WE HAVE RULES PAT
[5:16:05] <%Nupinoop296> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[5:16:07] <%tusk102> @floralkami so confirmed the things like 80 pounds and cloud swings it like a wood stick lmao
[5:16:08] <%Dragon_Batman> Spray and pray more like
[5:16:08] <%Drizzydre116> Is this the power of crazy talk?
[5:16:09] <%PigGuy800> I picture Pat having a spreadsheet of streams to predictions made by what chapter when he made them so on and so
[5:16:15] <%supersugoisenpai1> Collateral lies
[5:16:16] <%j0ustar> the more he types, the more he rights
[5:16:26] <%Firgof> The only rule in FF7:R is there are no rules so long as Spirit Gang is OK with it
[5:16:30] <%This_is_Marco> PEPE SILVIA
[5:16:30] <%Zebroneath> Just keep shooting till one at least hits. You'll never miss. LUL

[5:16:45] <%Firgof> Rats!!
[5:16:48] <+Remery_> Still waiting for that Cloud/Sephiroth kiss
[5:16:51] <%saynof> Knowing Nomura, he's going to try and re-implement a "connection" between Sephroph and Areith that was dropped from the orignial game.
[5:16:51] <%Dragon_Batman> LUL bubba
[5:16:52] <%tusk102> one of my favorite scenes so far is back at during the first "cloaked man" encounter when you first get back with tifa and cloud clangs his stupid big sword on the roof
[5:16:52] <%Visorak6> WERE THE RATS
[5:16:55] <%MrBorisMakarov> Kreygasm

[5:17:13] <%pynkdoe> jermaChomp WERE THE RATS
[5:17:16] <%skibadaa> I predict Hojo is secretly everyones stepdad
[5:17:17] <%RyanTheRecluse> I'll be honest I'm only checking Max's stream every now and again because of the toxic salt pit that is developing between the mods and chat.
[5:17:21] <%Pyroclase> I love you guys anyway
[5:17:23] <%Guardiansaiyan> @tigerfang86 I love that show
[5:17:25] <%Firgof> Forgiven for making the reference

[5:18:15] <%Darkfire346> I used to freeze gatorade and eat it like a popscicle. Shit was good
[5:18:21] <%ConLin_Arts_> Yeah pulp is great, but chewing orange juice???
[5:18:26] <%Dragon_Batman> Ultimate defense
[5:18:28] <+Remery_> had too many bugs in drinks, pulp makes me feel uncomfortable
[5:18:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> like Yoghurt?
[5:18:31] <%Firgof> 100% Pulp: It's Good Enough for Jetstream Sam so It's Good Enough For You
[5:18:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> @ConLin_Arts_ pulp is cool
[5:18:36] <%floralkami> I think the crabs are resistant to some materia you have
[5:18:38] <%ConLin_Arts_> ye
[5:18:45] <%king_wragles> At this point, I'm almost certain Pat just refers to oranges as orange juice

[5:20:23] <%RyanTheRecluse> @guardiansaiyan @optimasmaximas the mods are pretty gung ho, to an insane degree, about anyform of discussion or attempts to assist Max about the game and the chat isn't taking it lying down

[5:20:56] <%bevyrage> wasn't there an item to the north?
[5:20:58] <%ConLin_Arts_> She wanted some raincloud

[5:21:20] <%ShawnTK_> sahagins are fuckin assholes in this game
[5:21:21] <%Firgof> oof that clapback
[5:21:23] <%optimasmaximas> @RyanTheRecluse eh, i can see both sides, especially since max said he really didn't want help from chat
[5:21:23] <%Wolfstriker121> GODDAMN TIFA!!!
[5:21:23] <%ShawnTK_> 1
[5:21:26] <%Guardiansaiyan> @doc_ock_rokc not big enough...or DEEP enough..
[5:21:33] <%ringabal> DOOR STUCK
[5:21:35] <%RyanTheRecluse> @guardiansaiyan Yeah, particularly because the chat is subs only
[5:21:36] <%tigerfang86> 1
[5:21:37] <%Firgof> 'sorry but I gotta' (THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSION)
[5:21:40] <%Visorak6> FIRE UP
[5:21:40] <%WhereIsWill> damn Tifa vs sahagin PogChamp
[5:21:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> Also I found out that Aerith's VA is a youtuber and streamer?

[5:21:46] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan when they aren't screaming simp horny thirst etc, yeah
[5:21:47] <%Dragon_Batman> Yoo we firaga now
[5:21:53] <%Guardiansaiyan> @RyanTheRecluse I was lucky for someone to gift me a sub on his stream
[5:21:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Guardiansaiyan the main hold is doing fine for right now...but this is for emergencies
[5:21:56] <%Yummy_Nukes> damn cloud chill
[5:21:59] <%AzureGale> You gotta what?
[5:22:15] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami I guess thats why he put more emotes?
[5:22:18] <%ringabal> delicious delicious healing
[5:22:29] <%ringabal> Blorb
[5:22:31] <%Savarro> So in hard mode are there no items at all? Or just in combat?
[5:22:33] <%Sir_stride> dumb question: does pat know how to cast level 2 magic in battle?
[5:22:34] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan YEP
[5:22:37] <%TheActuallyGuy> ADDED EFFECT
[5:22:40] <%tigerfang86> that's OK I GUESS
[5:22:49] <%ConLin_Arts_> OSFrog
[5:22:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @RyanTheRecluse I can understand the sub only stuff...but hopefully the mods ca lighten up...but they probably can't cause max pulls in 20k people minimum so...
[5:22:51] <%Sir_stride> gotcha. took me a while
[5:22:54] <%Dragon_Batman> The master effect is what's nice, but it'll be a while
[5:22:57] <%Firgof> It's eh for later but for now it's pretty great for the fish gangs
[5:22:57] <%floralkami> @savarro in combat
[5:23:00] <%spiritofmojave> I didn't know how to cast Curara for the longest time lol
[5:23:01] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami I win!
[5:23:02] <%startstoprepeat> when the marlboro shows up in ffvii-3, you'll wish you levelled that up
[5:23:08] <%JohnAtDawn> I didn't until around this part of the game
[5:23:11] <%AzureGale> Materios, part of a balanced breakfast
[5:23:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> @startstoprepeat NO VII - #

[5:23:20] <+MaddyCaddy> MaddyCaddy subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months!
[5:23:21] <%Wolfstriker121> i was wondering that too
[5:23:22] <%JohnAtDawn> I got no idea
[5:23:22] <%Aeoneth> Wait warding gets extra effects on reaching max level
[5:23:22] <%optimasmaximas> hopefully
[5:23:26] <%Savarro> @floralkami thank god. No item run would be hell LUL
[5:23:28] <%Zebroneath> that's what worries me
[5:23:30] <%Firgof> "Yes, you have Firaga, but what about Firagagagagaga"
[5:23:31] <%rytyoung> I don't think it will but who knows
[5:23:31] <%Dragon_Batman> I kinda have a feeling it might if you have save data?
[5:23:31] <%Aeoneth> Fuck now I gotta grind it up
[5:23:32] <%Nupinoop296> ugh
[5:23:32] <%Hellarussian> no you just play as Johnny

[5:23:34] <%cvp5127> probably just add more weapon levels
[5:23:34] <%spiritofmojave> They should, cause the gameplay is stellar now
[5:23:35] <%Dragovus> Some of it has to, otherwise people will be pissed
[5:23:36] <%beepbeepbopbop> Oh this pump shit
[5:23:36] <%Sir_stride> just drink it 4Head
[5:23:37] <%Keyd00d> Firaza
[5:23:47] <%Guardiansaiyan> bop it
[5:23:47] <%Like51bears> i don't think it will carry over materia

[5:23:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> twist it

[5:23:55] <%AzureGale> Sewer temple
[5:23:59] <%Firgof> And now: girls pump things away from the boys
[5:24:00] <%Legato_Ambrose> I would think it would, considering I finished the game at level 30-something and I'm assuming there will be at least three parts total
[5:24:02] <%Keyd00d> part 2 will be a strategy game
[5:24:06] <%floralkami> @savarro it would be close to impossible since few moved restore MP
[5:24:07] <%skibadaa> TMNT time
[5:24:09] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i doubt they'd force you to restart but i bet they'll delete your materia (besides summons possible)
[5:24:14] <%Visorak6> But where does it go

[5:31:12] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt every time she says "this ones for you" i instantly finish it with "morph"

[5:31:53] <%Firgof> Yeah it's unfair to enemies that Starshower is AoE
[5:32:08] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Every time she says "This one's for you" I think of the bar-tending skeleton from Castlevania
[5:32:13] <%RyanTheRecluse> @patstaresat you should aim to get one of each type of green materia maxed out so you don't miss out on chadley challenges
[5:32:14] <%Like51bears> If you Starshower into Starshower it does even more damage
[5:32:16] <%j0ustar> My wifi just died. Good thing I got good data dammit

[5:42:20] <%chiluzza> TAYCO
[5:42:22] <%lord_traxis> Mayo...ontacos?
[5:42:23] <%reinbachthe3rd> I'm partial to carnitas for my tacos.
[5:42:23] <%Darkfire346> Are Tacos sandwiches? More at 9
[5:42:24] <%nanaki_ff14> kk sweet
[5:42:26] <@SoFarFetched> but that sounds interesting
[5:42:27] <%conradical> Pat can make your home made mayo
[5:42:30] <%Hellarussian> theres not mush room tho
[5:42:34] <%beepbeepbopbop> Fish tacos are pretty good too
[5:42:34] <%king_wragles> Those look really good
[5:42:34] <%WhereIsWill> I love mushrooms but What!?
[5:42:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Remery_ Tacos are like hotdogs, and hotdogs are sandwiches, so I dunno
[5:42:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt when will you be sponsored by Taco Bell?
[5:42:46] <%ringabal> Mushrooms are nuts, they can taste like anything
[5:42:56] <+Remery_> Hotdogs are sandwiches too?
[5:42:59] <%j0ustar> So chat, are soft tacos actual tacos or open burritos?
[5:43:02] <+Remery_> That's insane
[5:43:13] <%Guardiansaiyan> @j0ustar tacos with comfort cushion
[5:43:13] <%Firgof> It's handled Not Badly.
[5:43:19] <%Daniel_Is_I> I mean he's an artist, not a writer.
[5:43:22] <%Keyd00d> HE didn't write it
[5:43:23] <%WhereIsWill> the script ghosts
[5:43:26] <%Dragon_Batman> So far I'm liking it
[5:43:30] <%Nupinoop296> he didn't write it so it'll probably be fine
[5:43:32] <%코코꾸라> He wrote the story for every character, chat
[5:43:33] <%SaiyanShoto> But he didn’t even write it
[5:43:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> A hotdog is just a long meatball hoagie.
[5:43:34] <%코코꾸라> In the original
[5:43:35] <%BubbaRands> @j0ustar Are burritos just closed tacos?
[5:43:36] <%beepbeepbopbop> Same composer as FFXIII too
[5:43:38] <%Nupinoop296> oh???
[5:43:38] <%Keyd00d> The new stuff was a joint effort
[5:43:38] <%maximemeretrax> Nomura gets a bad rap but he's a legit visionary dude
[5:43:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mmmmm Mushrooms
[5:43:41] <%j0ustar> @guardiansaiyan true
[5:43:43] <%danpc5> he made the original concept for ff7
[5:43:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> @코코꾸라 let our dreams be DREAMS
[5:43:45] <%wsintai> @j0ustar Are tacos just cakes?
[5:43:49] <%indig0bird> Jeez, I'll do that
[5:43:49] <%beepbeepbopbop> Its why the music feels a lot like FF 13 at times.
[5:43:51] <%Hellarussian> I like when Cloud dabbed on the Hell House
[5:43:52] <%WhereIsWill> was wall market the best thing ever? @patstaresat
[5:43:53] <%코코꾸라> He's credited along Sakaguchi on the original FF7 as the main writer
[5:43:58] <%ringabal> Open cakes
[5:43:58] <%코코꾸라> Come on
[5:43:59] <%optimasmaximas> no?
[5:44:00] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt bruh?
[5:44:00] <%Dementedpenguin> WHAT
[5:44:02] <%Dragon_Batman> Noooo?
[5:44:02] <%danpc5> but Nojima is the writer for both
[5:44:03] <%SH1NK1R0> Remember that a director and a writer are not the same.
[5:44:04] <%pipboy344> Had to leave for a while. How long until Sector 7 collapse.
[5:44:04] <%Nupinoop296> he's got interesting ideas, he just needs other people to be there and help him out when he gets uhhhhh you know

[6:09:49] <%Farples> Before shinra building
[6:09:50] <%Jaller101514> 2 chapters from now
[6:09:53] <%Axellogic> A long ass time
[6:09:54] <%Firgof> Ah right, yeah it's a bit longer than that
[6:09:54] <%lord_traxis> Yeah. Did you get Aerith's?
[6:09:57] <%JohnAtDawn> There's a section after the plate falls, then you can go
[6:09:57] <%SH1NK1R0> After plate
[6:10:00] <%hzealot> no he didnt
[6:10:03] <%Keyd00d> Aerith's won't be for a whiiiile
[6:10:04] <%mechslayer71> After the section after this one
[6:10:10] <%Shwepie> @AzureGale Nylon, the old school kind you could wear your whole life and then pass down to your grandchild.
[6:10:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> yeah
[6:10:14] <%DetroitSentai> there's a chapter that expicity tells you to go do clean up because there is no going back
[6:10:19] <%lord_traxis> I missed hers in my playthrough
[6:10:23] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe they wanted to build on that ff7 and 10 thing
[6:10:25] <%SolidusRex> This is my favorite chapter
[6:10:27] <%supergoblinpunch> @reinbachthe3rd Enemy skill from Chadley
[6:10:29] <%VashyronM> @PatStaresAt The game will give you a direct notification about that shit. Don't worry about it.

[6:12:52] <%goose_attack_almanac> If these are ghosts, can you cast cure on them?
[6:12:54] <%wsintai> @lord_traxis They usually tell you if you step onto the non-progression path though
[6:13:01] <%GohanHitsugaya> Do you think FF9 will ever get a remake?
[6:13:01] <%Firgof> @goose_attack_almanac Yes
[6:13:11] <%Firgof> Does cost MP though of course
[6:13:12] <%Valdorick> No
[6:13:17] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[6:13:20] <%suikudo> No other FF game will ever get this much love
[6:13:22] <%GohanHitsugaya> Aw...
[6:13:24] <%luckysteak> FF9 is already perfect as is
[6:13:24] <%DetroitSentai> i'd rather ff9 not be remade, as a FF9 fanboy
[6:13:29] <%Valdorick> Sadly FF9 will forever remain amazing on its own, and not needmoney to be better than FF7
[6:13:33] <%wsintai> FF9 will get a remake in another 30 years maybe
[6:13:37] <%DetroitSentai> Just make a good port for once for
[6:13:39] <%suikudo> None of them not a single other game in the series will ever get this
[6:13:39] <%SirGO0SE> what if the time ghosts are part of a bigger plot to have a FF Universe game that has all of them
[6:13:40] <%ShawnTK_> only good FF games get remakes
[6:13:43] <%optimasmaximas> 6 should get a remake but that's cause it's a mess and needs it
[6:13:46] <%valriot> You can use raise spell to Insta kill
[6:13:54] <%Emperor_Machinus> what about FFVI?
[6:13:59] <%lord_traxis> I'd just settle for an upscaled FFIX
[6:14:01] <%Valdorick> Sides, yeah, FF6 would likely get the remake treatment first.
[6:14:05] <%Firgof> Mhm.
[6:14:09] <%SaphronBlackbourne> My friend thinks 6 deserve a remake the scale of this. Agree/Disagree?
[6:14:09] <%amused_platypus> If they did Clemps would die from joy
[6:14:11] <%Firgof> Kefka moves money.
[6:14:12] <%claudesavegely> Aerith ain't afraid of no ghosts
[6:14:19] <%SaiyanShoto> Only the best FF games get a remake Kappa
[6:14:19] <%Nobrev> an ff9 remake like this would be poggers but it's honestly great as is (except some of those ugly cutscene faces)
[6:14:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> Aerth loves ghosts
[6:14:27] <%Firgof> Just not as much money as 7/8/10
[6:14:37] <%hermitsen> hermitsen subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months!

[6:14:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Uno ghosto
[6:14:41] <%Shwepie> @SirGO0SE Please, no. I do not want Final Hearts.
[6:14:41] <%kewlmyc> Probably my least favorite chapter in the remake.
[6:14:42] <%wmeldrum> I'd want Chrono trigger if it's art style wasn't toriyama
[6:14:46] <%Firgof> Also they'd have to remix Dancing Mad again
[6:14:48] <%DrFacilier> psa1guy
[6:14:52] <%Firgof> And that thing's a massive thing
[6:14:53] <%Valdorick> Cutscene faces and the Disc 4 issue of 70% of the game becoming blocked off is all FF9 really needs.
[6:14:53] <%SirGO0SE> @Shwepie oh god that's what it'd be
[6:15:00] <%Teh_Un> It is an odd number of ghosts, yes
[6:15:00] <%Dragon_Batman> I really like this chapter
[6:15:06] <%코코꾸라> I really like it too
[6:15:06] <%hzealot> pat stairwell u missed
[6:15:08] <%prism_zet> this part is a nice surprise
[6:15:08] <%optimasmaximas> i like this chapter LUL cry more people
[6:15:09] <%Keyd00d> this is ia good one
[6:15:09] <%suikudo> Anyone who says wall market aint the best part of this game is just wrong
[6:15:13] <%hzealot> guess he forgot instantly
[6:15:14] <%prism_zet> not my fave, but still good
[6:15:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I like the interaction of the characters.
[6:15:18] <%VashyronM> FF6 is never going to get a good remake. They already did a mobile port. They are never touching that game again.
[6:15:22] <+Remery_> What ghosts are awesome, i hate all the lame Shinra enemies
[6:15:23] <%Yummy_Nukes> in neutral on the subject
[6:15:29] <%invisi_bliss> this chapters's good tho
[6:15:32] <%Firgof> This is a nice slow-paced chapter which bookends nicely against the High Octane of the previous and the next chapter
[6:15:36] <%SH1NK1R0> The chaper is great. But there is an enemy that isnt
[6:15:39] <%Dragon_Batman> The interaction is great, and even what comes up a little later
[6:15:44] <%VashyronM> Also, there is a scene in this chapter that fucking BROKE me.
[6:15:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM maybe you guys can mobilize? I am sure you might have a second go if enough attention is brought to FF6
[6:15:52] <%valriot> final 2 chapters are best besides the dog room
[6:16:03] <%Wolfstriker121> resident evil 4 remake in the works i guess...get ready for the LEON! screams
[6:16:05] <%Dragon_Batman> I think I know which one @VashyronM had me too
[6:16:14] <%optimasmaximas> oh?
[6:16:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea yea
[6:16:19] <%optimasmaximas> krey
[6:16:21] <%kewlmyc> It just feels weird. I get it was in the original, but going from "we need to save sector 7 " to scooby doo stuff just feels weird.

[6:16:32] <%Dragon_Batman> 3 slot both defenses
[6:16:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Wolfstriker121 watch the remake recreate Ashley into a Tifa wannabe
[6:16:37] <%amused_platypus> Do you think shin megami tensei nocturne will ever be remade byAtlus
[6:16:44] <%floralkami> big tittie goth gf with Tifa?
[6:16:46] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Goth girl...perfect for Cloud
[6:16:47] <%Hellarussian> ya boi Clud
[6:16:50] <%Firgof> lol no amused
[6:16:57] <%reinbachthe3rd> @amused_platypus I just want to hear about SMT V at this point.
[6:16:59] <%Shwepie> @VashyronM We'll never get to see Sabin suplex a train in glorious 4k. limesFeels
[6:17:06] <%Firgof> About as much chance that Prototype gets a reboot
[6:17:10] <%suikudo> SMT V has been turned into persona 6
[6:17:11] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[6:17:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> You mean that Persona spinoff?
[6:17:17] <%bread_assassin> Does it?
[6:17:17] <%optimasmaximas> they're still working on it im sure
[6:17:19] <%JumbleJams> I never forget :(
[6:17:24] <%Nobrev> it doesnt Kappa
[6:17:24] <%DetroitSentai> SMT V was just announced super early, just like P5
[6:17:25] <%hzealot> @floralkami andrea is the big tiddi goth gf in this game
[6:17:26] <%optimasmaximas> they just announced way too early
[6:17:27] <%suikudo> @Daniel_Is_I LUL
[6:17:30] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan I mean, perhaps, but I really don't it. Like, the mobile/steam version is the only version of that game I don't own because I'm so disappointed with it compared to all the love that 4 got. I just don't think Sqaure cares about it.
[6:17:33] <%ringabal> I thought we already got Persona 5?
[6:17:34] <%luckysteak> all these remakes this year have me worried about xenoblade, I hope it is a 1:1 port
[6:17:35] <%KasiCrafter> SMT? OH, you mean that Persona spinoff series? Kappa
[6:17:36] <%zetastriker> I love Persona, but I still like SMT more than it.
[6:17:40] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea I think they announced it early too
[6:17:41] <@SoFarFetched> SMT5 and Persona 5 are two different things.
[6:17:43] <%miguelrod777> what's smt do you mean persona
[6:17:44] <%VashyronM> @Shwepie Feels bad, but oh well.
[6:17:44] <%Keyd00d> Well when they announce the japanese release date don't worry it'll come out a year later here
[6:17:45] <%TimetodiveLTX> my first persona game was the tactics one for the DS
[6:17:47] <%mechslayer71> SMT 5 is about as real as Bayo 3 @patstaresat
[6:17:48] <%TalisKanju> Why do you like Tifa but hate Yukiko @PatStaresAt
[6:17:52] <%ChaosAethr> So What do people think of this Game is it Game of the Year for you?
[6:17:53] <%Drizzydre116> I love persona, never played an SMT
[6:17:54] <%genowyn> genowyn subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 15 months! Take my bezos bucks pat
[6:17:58] <%WhereIsWill> I'm 80 hours in on SMT4 playing it rn
[6:18:02] <%SH1NK1R0> P5 got a rerelease before smt5 got gameplay footage
[6:18:04] <%hzealot> not game of the year for me
[6:18:06] <%Zebroneath> Been wanting to play SMT4, but my 3DS is unfortunately dead.
[6:18:07] <%wsintai> @PatStaresAt Isn't SMT just that spinoff of Dead or Alive? Kappa
[6:18:08] <%hzealot> but it depends what else is out
[6:18:11] <%godzookylives> didn't they just show a logo and that was it?
[6:18:13] <%Firgof> @ChaosAethr That's tough because so many fucking good games have come out this year and Baldur's Gate 3 hasn't even launched yet
[6:18:13] <%floralkami> @hzealot that's not goth, that's vogue chic, you silly goose
[6:18:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM you just gotta hope something comes up for 6...find the team doing this or something and maybe get their attention on 6...after this game of course...
[6:18:34] <%Undenizen> What game is this? Looks TERRIBLE.
[6:18:35] <%Drizzydre116> Cyberpunk would have to be a major dissapointment to not win my GotY
[6:18:36] <%hzealot> @floralkami he reminds me of metallica from JJBA:GW
[6:18:39] <%optimasmaximas> do you guys think persona has officially overtaken SMT as Atlus's favorite series?
[6:18:46] <%prism_zet> @ChaosAethr Game of the year so far, not as infinitely replayable as the original but excited for the rest
[6:18:47] <%JumbleJams> @ChaosAethr oo early to say but the music fucking slaps so it better get an award for that at least
[6:18:50] <%Dragon_Batman> Maybe?
[6:18:54] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Considering the whole "Winter 2014" thing with P5, I expect Atlus just announces stuff too early in general
[6:18:58] <%Firgof> This game does have a fucking enormous soundtrack
[6:18:59] <%maximemeretrax> Love this XIII-2 type battle theme
[6:19:00] <%Nobrev> aerith's playstyle in this game is so fun
[6:19:00] <%Keyd00d> big so heal
[6:19:05] <%Zulrez> maybe put first strike on her for now?
[6:19:08] <%ringabal> This is the Death Stranding
[6:19:14] <%Shwepie> @optimasmaximas No, but they definitely know it makes them money.
[6:19:18] <%Firgof> Literally 30 tracks that don't play in the game outside of little radio stations
[6:19:18] <%JojoPiero> Death Strand box
[6:19:21] <%TalisKanju> You didn't notice that in the beginning of this area?
[6:19:21] <%코코꾸라> it is cute
[6:19:22] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM my GAME OF THE YEAR is Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles...a game thats so nitch I thought people forgot aout it BUT now there is a remaster on Swithc and PS4 so...F6 might get justic...
[6:19:23] <%mechslayer71> To anyone that knows the flow of FF7 original, would Wutai be right after this game or....?
[6:19:32] <%amused_platypus> @maximemeretrax that one was the best of the trilogy
[6:19:34] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan Maybe. This will be years and by then, people are going to want a new FF.
[6:19:40] <%wsintai> @mechslayer71 Not at all
[6:19:41] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 no lol
[6:19:43] <%lord_traxis> Wutai's a LOOOONG way away
[6:19:51] <%mechslayer71> Damn ok
[6:19:52] <%Nobrev> junon is after midgar iirc
[6:19:53] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mechslayer71 FF7 Original 20 hours in...this remake? 70 hours in
[6:19:55] <%Shwepie> Wutai is a myth.
[6:19:58] <%Firgof> Doesn't have to be, depending on how they do the open world
[6:20:01] <%cvp5127> @mechslayer71 wutai is optional
[6:20:04] <%suikudo> maybe in 2030
[6:20:04] <%ringabal> Part 2 for sure
[6:20:06] <%Keyd00d> Wutai's like game 3
[6:20:07] <%floralkami> @hzealot .... yeah, i don't see it. Andrea isn't wearing enough dark "i'm dying" makeup for that
[6:20:09] <%hzealot> @ChaosAethr heres the thiing its gonna get a nomination but i really dont expect it to win and i would put it top 5 but not #1 but again depends on how the year shapes up
[6:20:12] <%prism_zet> @mechslayer71 wutai is like 3/4 in the original, way ater
[6:20:15] <%maximemeretrax> @amused_platypus I want to play more of it...but I can't. I reached this one point and I just hate that boy party member with zero personality (liked all of the rest though)
[6:20:15] <%kewlmyc> Wutai ain't nothing to fuck with
[6:20:16] <%suikudo> thats a 2 pat
[6:20:17] <%Keyd00d> SourPls
[6:20:18] <%suikudo> thats a 2
[6:20:18] <%Firgof> Jazz Battle
[6:20:21] <%spiritofmojave> YEYEYE
[6:20:26] <%spiritofmojave> BOP
[6:20:29] <%Wolfstriker121> JAZZ HANDS!!!!
[6:20:30] <+Remery_> That Sax tho
[6:20:37] <%SABiscotti> Yo that's a SICK remix
[6:20:38] <%TalisKanju> Yeah, maybe in 3030, when everyone on the planet will be dead
[6:20:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[6:20:42] <%optimasmaximas> @Nobrev fort condor before that, and then the cave before that, then zolom, before that, then chocobo ranch, then.... NotLikeThis
[6:20:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM is 6 a long story? if not they might remake or remaster it minimum
[6:20:43] <%Firgof> This shows Cloud's true power
[6:20:43] <%prism_zet> i like that just cloud naps, the rest just watch and stand there
[6:20:47] <%DetroitSentai> It wont take as long for the next parts since a lot of the character design, combat systems and such is already done
[6:20:48] <%Undenizen> So, if I've never played a final fantasy before, is this a good intro?
[6:20:48] <%Dragon_Batman> It's a really good track
[6:20:49] <%Firgof> He can sleep even *while* enemies are near
[6:20:50] <%amused_platypus> @maximemeretrax he really is cardboard protag
[6:20:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> what did I miss?
[6:20:53] <%WhereIsWill> junon gonna be sick
[6:20:59] <%hzealot> @TalisKanju youre confusing 3030 with 2020 again
[6:21:01] <%Nobrev> manspread all over that bench
[6:21:06] <%Nupinoop296> it's true, cloud is cute
[6:21:10] <%optimasmaximas> cant wait to get a dolphin to help me climb a tower LUL
[6:21:11] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Undenizen yes...but I personally recommend Final Fantasy X as a first
[6:21:17] <%mechslayer71> I was thinking about playing the original, but I just looked at the screenshots on PSN... JEEZUS CHRIST I don’t think I care enough to put up with that shit LUL
[6:21:17] <%TimetodiveLTX> can't wait to fuck up the parade in HD
[6:21:19] <%Keyd00d> Don't forget the child CPR and dolphin jump minigame
[6:21:19] <%AzureGale> They secretly did it with him while he was asleep :x
[6:21:19] <%Dragon_Batman> Man the posing shit in that section is gonna be funny
[6:21:22] <%suikudo> The team is gonna go to water world to get accurate dolphin models
[6:21:22] <%Firgof> I am super curious to know what in the everliving fuck the Ancient Temple is going to become
[6:21:24] <%prism_zet> @Undenizen yes, but most ff's don't play like this haha
[6:21:29] <%cvp5127> what if each town gets a part LUL
[6:21:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mechslayer71 bring a guide and you'll be fine
[6:21:35] <%TalisKanju> You're right, I did confuse the two years
[6:21:35] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 it's fine, trust me play it
[6:21:38] <%Firgof> Also the entire submarine section
[6:21:43] <%lord_traxis> If the parade is anything like the squats minigame, I can already see myself throwing my controller
[6:21:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Firgof free real estste
[6:21:54] <%valriot> I feel like the next parts of FF7R wont actually take that long, cos most of the work is already done in this game. They've already made Niblehiem
[6:21:55] <%Keyd00d> Boss time
[6:21:57] <%Firgof> NO BEEP BOOP ALLOWED
[6:21:59] <%Wolfstriker121> OH shit
[6:22:00] <%PhysicsLB> after this game would be kalm>neibelheim flashback>chocobo ranch>midgar zolom>junon>costa del sol>corel>gold saucer>Gongaga>cosmo canyon>neibelheim>rocket town>THEN you could do wutai
[6:22:00] <%reinbachthe3rd> I'm playing the original right now, and I just got to Junon. The dolphin yeeting you 100 ft. in the air is hilarious. @optimasmaximas
[6:22:03] <%beepbeepbopbop> Yeah this fight
[6:22:04] <%luckysteak> can't wait to get ambushed by emerald weapon again
[6:22:06] <%hzealot> if you think squats mini game is annoying HOO BOY
[6:22:09] <%Wolfstriker121> SHES BENDING HER OVER
[6:22:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> So cute
[6:22:11] <%beepbeepbopbop> Great fight
[6:22:15] <%mechslayer71> @guardiansaiyan It’s not about a guide, it just looks SO SHIT
[6:22:16] <+Remery_> cower in fear
[6:22:21] <%optimasmaximas> @reinbachthe3rd yup LUL
[6:22:22] <%Shwepie> @Undenizen If everyone says, "Yes, but...." what they really meant to say was no.
[6:22:24] <%Andrizzleton> that's right chat Aeris
[6:22:25] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan It's pretty average length for a SNES RPG, I think.
[6:22:26] <%Firgof> It's Super Boo 'o clock
[6:22:26] <%BubbaRands> BOOKS WutFace
[6:22:29] <%ringabal> THE PHOOOOOONE
[6:22:33] <%lord_traxis> Well, not necessarily squats, but the OTHER one
[6:22:34] <%optimasmaximas> monkaS
[6:22:37] <%toastybites> I think I remember this from Indigo Prophesy
[6:22:39] <%shurtal> This boss fight annoyed me
[6:22:40] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mechslayer71 nostalgia solves everything..if you don't have that then find a movie version of the OG 7
[6:22:40] <%suikudo> Time ghosts!?
[6:22:41] <%prism_zet> @valriot do you remember how big ff7 is? Its not just nibelheim
[6:22:44] <%hzealot> @lord_traxis thats what im talking about lol
[6:22:45] <%Nupinoop296> *BIG CONCERN*
[6:22:45] <%Wolfstriker121> PERSONA?
[6:22:48] <%karl_rex> Fusion HA
[6:22:51] <%ChaosAethr> Ghost Boss Time
[6:22:52] <%suikudo> THE GHOST CRYSTAL
[6:22:53] <%ringabal> THATS A DARK SOUL
[6:22:53] <%ergulor> Ghostnado
[6:22:53] <%miguelrod777> future ghosts?!
[6:22:54] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I ain't afraid of no ghost
[6:22:56] <%optimasmaximas> OH SHIT
[6:22:56] <%Keyd00d> HELL GHOST
[6:22:57] <%AzureGale> When did the castlevania books guest star in this game
[6:23:00] <%NovaKnightmare> YOOOOO
[6:23:01] <%BubbaRands> GET READY
[6:23:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM then a minor remake should work...wasn't FF1 short too? and they remade that
[6:23:02] <%toastybites> WHAT
[6:23:03] <%Maids4lyfe> cast cure on it!
[6:23:03] <%Valdorick> PHANTOON!?
[6:23:04] <%Wolfstriker121> EVIL GENGAR!
[6:23:07] <%maximemeretrax> This is an enjoyable boss
[6:23:08] <%Keyd00d> LUL
[6:23:09] <%luckysteak> Big spooks
[6:23:10] <%Teh_Un> D:
[6:23:11] <%hzealot> i hope his name is like poltergeist
[6:23:14] <%realm_forge> SOULNADO
[6:23:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Fuck yeah
[6:23:15] <%MrBorisMakarov> D:
[6:23:15] <%TimetodiveLTX> THAT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH GHOSTS
[6:23:16] <%GohanHitsugaya> Da fook?
[6:23:16] <+Remery_> Coolest boss in the game
[6:23:16] <%ringabal> BOXES YO WE GOT BOXES
[6:23:17] <%optimasmaximas> aerith slid over LUL
[6:23:17] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan The second half of the game takes you awhile though, cause you basically start over and have to re-explore the world and find all your characters.
[6:23:19] <%NovaKnightmare> PHOENIX DOWN THE BITCH
[6:23:20] <%OneGorillionDollars> D:
[6:23:22] <%plus_on_black> It's Ghost Pimp
[6:23:22] <%Nupinoop296> trying to be brave
[6:23:25] <%Nobrev> D: BAD WORD
[6:23:26] <%PhysicsLB> I AM THE BOX GHOST
[6:23:27] <%toastybites> GHOUL what a shit name
[6:23:29] <%Keyd00d> Pat please read
[6:23:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM ooooh...wel...padding can be worked around
[6:23:37] <%weissguard> I AM the BOX GHOOOOOST, OOOOOH.... BEWARE!
[6:23:40] <%Firgof> Psycho Mantis Time
[6:23:42] <%godzookylives> How many games in total do you think FF7 will be?
[6:23:44] <%reinbachthe3rd> Pat using his JFK voice.
[6:23:44] <%realm_forge> ooooo that’s spooky actually
[6:23:47] <%Guardiansaiyan> @weissguard have the WHOLE series!
[6:23:55] <%mechslayer71> @guardiansaiyan Games older than I am, so no nostalgia. If only the had the sense to future proof it with 2D like Chrono Trigger, which I did play.
[6:23:57] <%floralkami> YEET
[6:23:58] <%PhysicsLB> at least three. probably more
[6:24:02] <%prism_zet> @godzookylives they said 2, but i'm guessing 3 likely
[6:24:03] <%weissguard> @Guardiansaiyan Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
[6:24:04] <%suikudo> Quick plug the controller into player 2
[6:24:07] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mechslayer71 if only
[6:24:13] <%optimasmaximas> @Guardiansaiyan niiiceu!
[6:24:16] <%Hellarussian> silenced LUL
[6:24:20] <%Keyd00d> camera pls
[6:24:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @weissguard it was on sale for $25 at walmart
[6:24:23] <%hzealot> camera where are you ol
[6:24:25] <%Guardiansaiyan> @optimasmaximas ??
[6:24:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> So monsters, mutants, gods, and Ghost exist?
[6:24:42] <%Visorak6> You have tier 3 fire right?
[6:24:45] <%floralkami> damn. i feel i should re-DANNY PHANTOM, YEAH
[6:24:45] <%Firgof> @PatStaresAt Greyed out means 'Can't Use This Spell/Ability' it's a helper tool to let you know something's immune
[6:24:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Aight its late. Ill catch the rest on VOD
[6:24:51] <%weissguard> @Guardiansaiyan Sick, good deal.
[6:24:53] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TurtlesAndTentacles yes
[6:25:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Poisoned too, nice
[6:25:04] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami yeah!
[6:25:04] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 im 19, the game is old but fine to play
[6:25:06] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan I mean, they redid 4 like 3 different times in the span of 10 years and that story is not very complex. At this point, I think I'd rather than just have them leave it alone and enjoy my weird cameos than risk another bad remaster/port.
[6:25:06] <%godzookylives> @prism_zet If it's only 2 then this would make the first part seem almost too tiny
[6:25:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> See ya later bois
[6:25:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Have a good one Baller
[6:25:20] <%optimasmaximas> @Guardiansaiyan danny phantom
[6:25:21] <%rytyoung> See ya dude!
[6:25:29] <%Hellarussian> psaBig immune
[6:25:30] <%RyanTheRecluse> bio spell is physical i think
[6:25:32] <%Wolfstriker121> BODIED
[6:25:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM maybe if your lucky someone will mod it and you can get it then?
[6:25:34] <%amused_platypus> ouuu Bio is doing work
[6:25:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> @optimasmaximas Phantom!
[6:25:39] <%hzealot> cloud just dove at the bulet aimedd at aerith ol
[6:25:44] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What are you doing?
[6:25:48] <%Nobrev> i think it says reduced when cloud hits its physical form because of the element materia
[6:25:54] <%prism_zet> @godzookylives yeah thats why i'm feeling like 3 parts at least, although my first playthrough ran 40:21, there are parts they could streamline and parts they could expand
[6:26:04] <%mechslayer71> @optimasmaximas I’m sure it’s fine to play and all, but I already have a good chunk of long ass modern RPG’s that I want to get too that I don’t have to fix in my mind with past vision
[6:26:05] <%VashyronM> @Guardiansaiyan Possibly.
[6:26:10] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Guardiansaiyan THis is the coolest. We got Mecha adn Big boobs!
[6:26:12] <%prism_zet> @godzookylives depends how they treat the open world really
[6:26:32] <%godzookylives> 3 makes the most sense anymore would seem a little ridiculous.
[6:26:35] <%TheSniperJoe> TheSniperJoe subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! I might be in the minority here but I haven't really enjoyed some of the new takes on old areas that Remake has to offer...cept the Train Graveyard. Really dug this section, nothing clever to say about it, just felt better handled overall.
[6:26:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TurtlesAndTentacles caters to all kinks
[6:26:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> @VashyronM hopefully
[6:26:55] <%Nupinoop296> oh that boss is doing a kingdom hearts
[6:26:56] <%Nobrev> i wonder if there even will be an open world map...
[6:27:14] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TheSniperJoe the main reason might be because Square lied about it being a faithful recreation
[6:27:17] <%Shwepie> @Nobrev Ever or in this specific game?
[6:27:20] <%lord_traxis> I doubt there'll be an open world map
[6:27:30] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 that's perfectly okay, i've been chipping away at it bewteen releases and when i have nothing else to play so i understand how you feel; i still gotta finish outer worlds, nier automata (just started it), P5R, and this remake before i get back to it
[6:27:31] <%thenumber5point5> dont guess thos ghost is like old school Final Fantasy and weak to healing moves
[6:27:32] <%reinbachthe3rd> Fuck, man - just found out my step-dad lost his job. This COVID-19 shit sucks ass.
[6:27:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> @lord_traxis don't let our dreams be DREAMS
[6:27:34] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Guardiansaiyan I have seen no tentacles yet
[6:27:40] <%prism_zet> @Nobrev exactly lol, i'm expecting something much more routed, maybe ff15 style car routes,
[6:27:41] <%hzealot> he mad
[6:27:42] <%SABiscotti> We Bloodborne Now
[6:27:49] <%TheSniperJoe> @Guardiansaiyan Oh yeah, from the very beginning. Least we forget at one point this game was being brought to you by CyberConnect.
[6:27:49] <%Alazull> Oh shit yeah this is a pretty fun fight
[6:27:49] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TurtlesAndTentacles might be an optional boss
[6:27:51] <%ringabal> GHOST RAGE
[6:27:54] <%lord_traxis> I can see them sticking with the chapters section and then the Highwind being something of a fast travel machine for the various hubs
[6:27:55] <%RyanTheRecluse> I don't know if ff will ever get crazier than using phoenix down to kill a train
[6:28:03] <%Nobrev> I mean in the next parts. I already finished this one
[6:28:05] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TheSniperJoe truth
[6:28:13] <%lord_traxis> But boy would I mark out if they gave us the full open world
[6:28:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> Wasn't Pat supposed to say this game is sponsored yet?
[6:28:32] <%Dragon_Batman> He did when he ate at least
[6:28:32] <%TimetodiveLTX> it's fiiiine
[6:28:36] <%Alazull> Use magic
[6:28:38] <%mechslayer71> @optimasmaximas I gotta do P5R, Outer Worlds, Finish off the last bit of Pillars of eternity, do pillars 2... yeah I’m not gonna go back to that blocky shit with all this modern stuff on my plate
[6:28:41] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Dragon_Batman okay
[6:28:43] <%DonatelloJose> hurt me more dog
[6:28:52] <%AzureGale> All these grunts are strangely erotic o_o
[6:28:56] <%barkon345> im thinking its going to be a lot like FF10 where they still travel through out the world through all kinds of different enviroments but there will be no full dedticated world map
[6:29:05] <%mechslayer71> But yeah, any estimates on when remake part 2 is likely to be coming?
[6:29:05] <%PanicSwytch> Music is so good
[6:29:11] <%reinbachthe3rd> @barkon345 Seems most likely.
[6:29:17] <%Kriss1827> how long till part 2 will it be out? whatcha guys think
[6:29:19] <%prism_zet> @Nobrev yeah i know what you mean, i finished up this one too. If they cut the grindy bits out of the open world, and just made them about travelling, they would go fast for sure
[6:29:24] <%floralkami> @mechslayer71 3 years, my bet
[6:29:34] <%Firgof> @Kriss1827 Before COVID-19 I'd bet 1.5 years
[6:29:36] <%barkon345> im thinking 2 years
[6:29:36] <%Alazull> @mechslayer71 2-3 years
[6:29:52] <%lord_traxis> In a true and just world? Next year. Probably closer to 2 or 3 years, though...
[6:29:55] <%RyanTheRecluse> my biggest hope for remake is they sort out their file compression because this game shouldn't be 100gb
[6:30:03] <%Like51bears> TIME FOR CUMHAZZARD
[6:30:04] <%optimasmaximas> @mechslayer71 yeah i gotta do pillars too lmao; i'd just say go back to it whenever you get through all your stuff and feel like taking a look back at the older version of the remake and see what's in store for the rest of the remakes
[6:30:05] <%PanicSwytch> Chances are they're working on them simultaneously. Maybe 2 years
[6:30:06] <%saadi90> Yeah 2-3 the earliest
[6:30:07] <%Nobrev> since they have the engine done and a good portion of assets im gonna guess a yearly or bi yearly shedule
[6:30:08] <%Firgof> @RyanTheRecluse It's literally the audio files
[6:30:10] <%RyanTheRecluse> remake 2 I mean
[6:30:10] <%Dragon_Batman> I was thinking 2 years max but with Covid, who knows
[6:30:20] <%Firgof> It's always the audio that takes up huge amounts of space in games that have lots of VA
[6:30:32] <%hzealot> what a combat system lol
[6:30:42] <%PanicSwytch> Do u guys think this might be just a 2 parter or 3?
[6:30:51] <%optimasmaximas> 4 parter
[6:30:51] <%mechslayer71> I don’t think it’ll be 3, it took less than five from the original announcement for this one, and that was with the original build from Cyber Connect getting scrapped and starting all over again. The engine and combat system is figured out, the template is there, I don’t think it’ll take that long... if they don’t fuck around that is
[6:30:51] <+Remery_> I didn't know this thing has a grab, looks terrifying
[6:30:52] <%optimasmaximas> easily
[6:30:57] <%Nobrev> most likely 3 or 4 parts
[6:31:07] <%barkon345> and when even the backround extras have voice actors thats a whole lot of audio files
[6:31:24] <%optimasmaximas> this game is fucking MASSIVE
[6:31:25] <%ringabal> I AM THE TABLE
[6:31:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Jesus
[6:31:38] <%hzealot> i just dont want al the parts to be $60
[6:31:45] <%Firgof> This is one of the first times the game turns your fight into a real *fight* and not just an encounter
[6:31:47] <%prism_zet> really depends on how large each part is, and how detailed they get, the original is huge, with tons of stuff to cover
[6:31:47] <%Alazull> @mechslayer71 You aren't accounting for COVID making it so they probably can't be in the office for at least six months
[6:31:55] <%floralkami> @mechslayer71 well, lets say i would hope it's 2-3 years, so they can get everything really polished
[6:31:57] <%Maids4lyfe> why hasn't anyone tried using Cure or Phoenix Down on the ghosts yet? NotLikeThis
[6:32:02] <%AzureGale> Protip: those ground flames hurt
[6:32:04] <%Nobrev> ll if they're all full games why wouldn't they be 60
[6:32:05] <%Firgof> @Maids4lyfe It hurts them
[6:32:05] <%barkon345> well if all the parts are as high quality as this I will gladly pay full price for each of them
[6:32:07] <%mechslayer71> I’m cool with all the parts being 60 if the remount of content is the same as this game
[6:32:08] <%prism_zet> @hzealot they absolutely will haha, especially if it only comes out every 2 years
[6:32:14] <%TonberryLives> @hzealot Oh don't worry they will be
[6:32:16] <%Guardiansaiyan> That Ghost sounds like NEMESIS when hit!
[6:32:18] <%Firgof> Boss is sadly immune to P.Down. Does take lots of damage from Revive while vulnerable though
[6:32:25] <%jessedouglas> what if you got a discount on remake part 2 if you got remake part 1?
[6:32:28] <%optimasmaximas> like there's so much shit to do and all the different locations and we can assume they want to expand on everything given how they've handled this game, so 4 parter easily; wouldn't be surprised if it were 5
[6:32:38] <%Shwepie> @mechslayer71 Part 2 will be released in 3 years, then Part 3 will come out 14 years after that.
[6:32:40] <%Maids4lyfe> @Firgof thank you, I don't have the game yet and I was hoping they would work
[6:32:43] <%lord_traxis> Anyone with a ps4 pro have crap texture issues or is it just because I'm on a basic ps4?
[6:32:43] <%Guardiansaiyan> @jessedouglas thats called incentive
[6:32:52] <%Firgof> Yeah, don't forget the Main Quest of 7 was about 60-80 hours long without hardly any sidequests.
[6:32:53] <%Valdorick> RIP Cloud, I can't believe he's fucking dead.
[6:33:00] <%Dragon_Batman> Almost there
[6:33:00] <%Firgof> *300* hours about with all sidequests and materia and summons
[6:33:01] <%beepbeepbopbop> Textures do have issues on PS4 cloud
[6:33:03] <%Dragon_Batman> Nice
[6:33:11] <%Dragon_Batman> Subversion materia
[6:33:13] <%Keyd00d> Just playing
[6:33:15] <%Kriss1827> @lord_traxis i have texture issues on ps4 pro too
[6:33:15] <%jessedouglas> @guardiansaiyan exactly.
[6:33:15] <%beepbeepbopbop> PS4 pro that is
[6:33:21] <%optimasmaximas> FeelsBadMan
[6:33:22] <%za7az> Oh fuck off
[6:33:24] <%floralkami> first try poggers
[6:33:24] <%wiley_boi> what?
[6:33:27] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[6:33:28] <%Valdorick> Don't admire that you dumb binch!
[6:33:29] <%pynkdoe> BibleThump
[6:33:31] <%Nupinoop296> what the fuck
[6:33:34] <%toastybites> THAT WAS NOT PLAYING
[6:33:35] <%amused_platypus> quick question could you steal from it
[6:33:35] <%hzealot> clean first try EZCLAP
[6:33:36] <%Keyd00d> Very fun play time
[6:33:38] <%Yummy_Nukes> doodSad
[6:33:42] <%DetroitSentai> just bench
[6:33:42] <%ChaosAethr> FF fanfare
[6:33:44] <%ringabal> That ghost needed to workshop its Fighting combos
[6:33:47] <%spiritofmojave> playing with poltergeists :)
[6:33:49] <%spiritofmojave> fun :)
[6:33:49] <%KaiserMario> They are pretty chill considering THE PLATE WILL DROP
[6:33:49] <%Axellogic> the bench is right behind you
[6:33:52] <%Alazull> Those are the souls of dead kids y'all
[6:33:53] <+Remery_> The Ghost children just wanted to die in a epic way
[6:33:56] <%Firgof> It's CC the Materia
[6:33:59] <%Daniel_Is_I> So has Aerith always been able to talk to ghosts?
[6:34:01] <%optimasmaximas> @amused_platypus haven't found the steal materia yet, dunno if it's even in the game
[6:34:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> cloud don't be dumb
[6:34:03] <%suikudo> You dont ever fight to the death with your friends?! Woolie does it alot!
[6:34:03] <%Alazull> Breach and Dispel
[6:34:05] <%supergoblinpunch> Put on steal, Pat
[6:34:07] <%Dragon_Batman> I think you could steal but I don't know what it would give, honestly forgot to check that
[6:34:08] <%prism_zet> its to break barriers and stuff
[6:34:08] <%Firgof> *Counterspell the Materia
[6:34:09] <%toastybites> *Throws washing machine* No it was just a prank bro
[6:34:10] <%Valdorick> "Aw man, its really sad that these murder ghosts were just sad they couldn't find someone who could murder them."
[6:34:12] <%hzealot> anti barrier / reflect @PatStaresAt
[6:34:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Remery_ without Epic gamestore
[6:34:12] <%JumbleJams> @Daniel_Is_I i mean, lifestream
[6:34:13] <%DetroitSentai> breach gets rid of protect and recflect
[6:34:19] <%Hellarussian> Aerith is off her rocker
[6:34:21] <%optimasmaximas> WAIT STEAL EXISTS?!
[6:34:22] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea you should uhhh have steal
[6:34:23] <%optimasmaximas> WTF
[6:34:25] <%Keyd00d> When the time comes the game will tell him
[6:34:25] <%floralkami> @daniel_is_i i think it's a part of the lifestream thing, like she can with the flowers
[6:34:26] <%SH1NK1R0> Pat literally has steal on
[6:34:35] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Valdorick if thats the only way you could die in the afterlife you would be pretty sad too
[6:34:36] <%코코꾸라> You could just have used a phoenix down on the boss
[6:34:40] <%Like51bears> you need steal soon
[6:34:41] <+Remery_> @Guardiansaiyan indeed
[6:34:44] <%Firgof> @코코꾸라 Sadly doesn't work
[6:34:52] <%코코꾸라> Really?
[6:34:55] <%beepbeepbopbop> Yup
[6:34:55] <%Firgof> Revive does, but it doesn't do instakill
[6:34:57] <%Keyd00d> psa1guy
[6:34:58] <%Alazull> Really
[6:34:58] <%king_wragles> Phoenix downs can get resisted, but not all the time
[6:34:58] <%Valdorick> !uptime
[6:34:59] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 6h 35m.
[6:35:05] <%Maids4lyfe> Revive and Cure work instead
[6:35:06] <%AzureGale> Does steal just take people's underwear
[6:35:08] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Valdorick SSSHHHH
[6:35:12] <%Maids4lyfe> or is it just Revive?
[6:35:12] <%코코꾸라> Someone on Discord said it worked for them
[6:35:14] <%MrBorisMakarov> 1 guy atpRtsd
[6:35:15] <%Dragon_Batman> oooh magic based?
[6:35:16] <%LaughingCatt> It did for me when its in intangible form
[6:35:16] <%코코꾸라> Gonna kick their ass
[6:35:22] <%hzealot> @AzureGale hes not kazuma desu
[6:35:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AzureGale I get that reference
[6:35:27] <%Guardiansaiyan> @MrBorisMakarov we killed ONE GUY 2 parts ago
[6:35:28] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> does steal still steal?
[6:35:32] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[6:35:36] <%Firgof> Maybe I was unfortunate and it was in the middle of switching forms and had iFrames
[6:35:38] <%Guardiansaiyan> Ghosts can't melt STEAL BEAMS
[6:35:41] <%prism_zet> yes lol
[6:35:42] <%TalisKanju> Did Phoenix Down turn into Hama spells?
[6:35:43] <%Alazull> Important life lesson for life on the ground floor
[6:35:45] <%Keyd00d> No, instead it gives the enemy items
[6:35:48] <%Alazull> Take a little nap
[6:35:51] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[6:35:53] <%barkon345> @PatStaresAt what are you going to do if woolie is not finished with the game by next podcast?
[6:35:55] <%Dragon_Batman> I personally think you get a better chance when an enemy is under pressure for it to work better
[6:36:00] <%AzureGale> Can you go to sleep as Aerith or Tifa
[6:36:02] <%Guardiansaiyan> @barkon345 lament
[6:36:03] <%Firgof> @barkon345 Shame him lol
[6:36:10] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[6:36:11] <%PanicSwytch> One guy is too strong. One guy has multiple lives
[6:36:14] <%Alazull> He will give him a through dressing down
[6:36:15] <%ChaosAethr> I beat it in three days
[6:36:19] <%rytyoung> Chat remind Pat to have steal at the ready psaUp
[6:36:20] <%ringabal> HOW DARE YOU NOT FINISH THIS 60 HOUR GAME ON OPENING NIGHT
[6:36:26] <%prism_zet> @Dragon_Batman yeah i've had better success when they are staggered
[6:36:28] <%espanishcanamurciana> quick pat what's the equation for slope intercept
[6:36:29] <%Firgof> Flex on his inability to fight ghosts quickly
[6:36:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> This is an indie game @PatStaresAt
[6:36:30] <%reinbachthe3rd> Bad, Woolie - back to the Woolie Hole.
[6:36:30] <%TonberryLives> He doesn't care about being relevant Pat LUL
[6:36:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> it's your job to play givedo mames
[6:36:37] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rytyoung Okay
[6:36:41] <%weissguard> He's not gonna be done with it by next podcast. Woolie seems like he always has a lot on his plate.
[6:36:41] <%Daniel_Is_I> One thing the FF series has taught me is STEAL FROM EVERYONE
[6:36:46] <%Undenizen> Pat, was that your black-guy voice?
[6:36:53] <%Dragon_Batman> @prism_zet kool, good to see it just wasn't me
[6:36:54] <%weissguard> Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but still.
[6:36:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @PatStaresAt Hey Pat, you should have STEAL equipped.
[6:36:56] <%Alazull> Too busy with his Dokapon Kingdoms and being up his own ass about KOTOR 2
[6:36:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Woolie lives to be an outsider just to be one
[6:37:00] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Daniel_Is_I BUT your mom
[6:37:03] <%floralkami> oh, Woolie is also playing it? i wouldn't have figured he be into FF7 or-- wait, he totally loved FF10, nevermind
[6:37:09] <%TalisKanju> Pat is unquestionably blacker than Woolie
[6:37:16] <%MrBorisMakarov> @king_wolf_rigger he does
[6:37:17] <%Firgof> Woolie could get it done by next podcast. That depends I think a lot on how much he is consumed by Dokapon Kingdom though
[6:37:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami apparently he plays it off stream for himself
[6:37:19] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Triple Slash helps with crowd control
[6:37:22] <%PanicSwytch> Steal is mandatory in FF12
[6:37:22] <%hzealot> i missed it in my playthru can someone give a vague answer to where he needs steal for?
[6:37:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> wow this move is gonna make me miss her when she's dead
[6:37:31] <%SH1NK1R0> Aerith is stronk af
[6:37:32] <%Alazull> Bosses
[6:37:33] <%AzureGale> "Stop killing me, monster"
[6:37:37] <%hzealot> like a chapter or some vague boss hint or w/e
[6:37:37] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PanicSwytch truth...Vaan does nothign but steal
[6:37:39] <%optimasmaximas> woolie tweeted today that he will be playing black mesa every day this week for the stream
[6:37:41] <%mechslayer71> @alazull You know, the important things that will grow his channel
[6:37:42] <%Alazull> You want to steal from bosses
[6:37:51] <%Daniel_Is_I> Steal gives some of the best weapons in FF3
[6:37:53] <%Dragon_Batman> It was something you missed very early
[6:37:58] <%DetroitSentai> you already did right before the boss
[6:38:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MrBorisMakarov I know, someone in chat made a joke saying that chat should make sure he does, so I obliged by being a shitter lol.
[6:38:03] <%floralkami> @guardiansaiyan good, he deserves his own game time. i do hope he does a bit of hardcore mode in the future, tho
[6:38:04] <%Alazull> Pat go back to beginning
[6:38:05] <%barkon345> @optimasmaximas he has been playing FF7 on his off time
[6:38:13] <%Alazull> The train is down now
[6:38:20] <%Guardiansaiyan> @floralkami hopefully
[6:38:20] <%MrBorisMakarov> @king_wolf_rigger doodDerp
[6:38:21] <%Firgof> @PatStaresAt I got lost here too. It's the controls back near the stairs you first went up to get here you want to use, then go down and get into it
[6:38:34] <%optimasmaximas> @barkon345 oh i know but someone said something about him playing
[6:38:37] <%Hellarussian> im with Cloud here
[6:38:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @MrBorisMakarov That's an amazing emote hahaha
[6:38:40] <%Dragon_Batman> That is what you missed
[6:38:47] <+Remery_> Cloud's spooked
[6:38:48] <%maximemeretrax> How do you all feel about the FFXIII influence in this game? Toriyama did a lot on this game
[6:38:55] <%Firgof> I think it's fine
[6:38:55] <%AzureGale> Then it becomes Corpse Party
[6:38:56] <%Dragon_Batman> They talk about how there is no power
[6:38:59] <%코코꾸라> It's fine
[6:39:02] <%Firgof> The combat system for instance is Gold Standard
[6:39:09] <%VritraReiRei> They are all the player who got a Game Over in this section
[6:39:12] <%Dragon_Batman> Steal all you can
[6:39:14] <%TalisKanju> Look at this Resident Evil ass area in this game
[6:39:14] <%ringabal> oh yea
[6:39:15] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Holy christ, Tifa is so goddam stacked.
[6:39:16] <%optimasmaximas> @barkon345 sorry hit enter on accident; him playing "his dokapons and kotors" so i was saying he would only be playing black mesa this week
[6:39:19] <%Firgof> @PatStaresAt Steal from Reno. Kill the Dog Immediately.
[6:39:23] <%Farples> Maybe
[6:39:23] <%TimetodiveLTX> 1yr 0crime
[6:39:25] <%startstoprepeat> reno has a nice accessory
[6:39:25] <%hzealot> @PatStaresAt im sure youl figure it out @PatStaresAt
[6:39:27] <%Farples> Maybe not
[6:39:28] <%mechslayer71> @maximemeretrax Well the stagger system and the music are great, so those are two good things it inherited
[6:39:29] <%Hellarussian> one year
[6:39:30] <+Remery_> steal his virginity
[6:39:33] <%Farples> You'll see
[6:39:34] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Steal Reno's panties
[6:39:38] <%mechslayer71> Nope, next boss @patstaresat
[6:39:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> STEAL HIS UNDERWEAR
[6:39:41] <%PanicSwytch> I prefer the item usage system in FF15 over this
[6:39:45] <+Remery_> And steal Rude's sunglasses
[6:39:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Can we not spoil bosses @beepbeepbopbop ?
[6:39:50] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Remery_ thats Rude's job
[6:39:52] <%barkon345> its ok but yea you can feel itsinfluence with the lots of really pretty but barrren hallways
[6:39:53] <%VritraReiRei> Does Pat have Steal Equipped?
[6:39:59] <%maximemeretrax> Aren’t y’all back seating rn
[6:40:07] <%Nobrev> yes pat has steal equipped
[6:40:10] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Visorak6 his goblins might take care of that
[6:40:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @VritraReiRei I dunno, we should yell at Pat more to make certain
[6:40:17] <%SH1NK1R0> Lol the items in ff15 undermined all challenge
[6:40:21] <%reinbachthe3rd> NOOOOO
[6:40:28] <%reinbachthe3rd> Aerith got yeeted.
[6:40:33] <%hzealot> PaT dO yOu HaVe StEa?
[6:40:36] <%Hellarussian> LUL
[6:40:40] <%Firgof> In fairness, the tactic I described is pretty much 'just how you do the fight fast in FF7' in the first place haha
[6:40:40] <%NovaKnightmare> LASER PISS
[6:40:42] <%ChaosAethr> yes
[6:40:44] <%ringabal> PERFECT
[6:40:46] <%floralkami> @panicswytch you mean the consumable magicks?
[6:40:48] <%Firgof> The dog was annoying in 7 and it continues to be here

[6:41:08] <%prism_zet> you figured it oue
[6:41:11] <%barkon345> you know to this day I still cant figure out why FFx feels less like a Hallway simulator then FFXIII even though they bolth had no world maps
[6:41:21] <%Hellarussian> the first ghost was a train
[6:41:21] <%Firgof> More curves and pitstops

[6:43:13] <%Alazull> No Tifa you fool it was a RUSE

[6:43:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> MindGhostlins is damn good
[6:43:21] <%Firgof> Because Shinra doesn't know how to recycle are you serious lol
[6:43:22] <%Nupinoop296> she was taken on a ruse cruise
[6:43:22] <%PhysicsLB> let's not waste time here *sits on bench for indeterminate amount of time*
[6:43:23] <%Drizzydre116> These feels sponcered by square enix
[6:43:24] <%Guardiansaiyan> @maximemeretrax its a bigger hallway for us...like a highway
[6:43:26] <%Buzzard42> monkaS
[6:43:26] <%AzureGale> What a convinent bench
[6:43:28] <%Keyd00d> How does he know
[6:43:28] <%Hellarussian> psaBig UH OH
[6:43:29] <%ChaosAethr> Oh BOY
[6:43:34] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks PatStaresAt is Sponsored by Square Enix but without the PERKS imGlitch Kupo
[6:43:35] <%optimasmaximas> monkaS
[6:43:35] <%prism_zet> gunfire in the distance
[6:43:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> more like Sergei Popov
[6:43:40] <%TalisKanju> When is Clumbo going to see visions of Sassafrass again?
[6:43:44] <%ChaosAethr> The PILLAR
[6:43:46] <%espanishcanamurciana> Look at that dark souls greatsword
[6:43:52] <%ringabal> Pay no mind to the backround explosions
[6:43:54] <%skibadaa> POP off is REAL
[6:43:56] <%baronblank> does he have steal equipped?
[6:44:01] <%Axellogic> Press the level and pull the button
[6:44:01] <%Hellarussian> Ghost philosophy brought to you by Square Enix
[6:44:02] <%TimetodiveLTX> how the turn tables...
[6:44:03] <%j0ustar> I see booms
[6:44:05] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea he has steal
[6:44:09] <%Valdorick> Oh no
[6:44:10] <%Valdorick> RATS
[6:44:11] <%baronblank> okay cool
[6:44:11] <%VritraReiRei> Remember guys, no backseating. Let Pat play however he wants, as optimally/unoptimally as he wants
[6:44:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> They really improved this section from OG FF7
[6:44:17] <%Nobrev> yes chat again for the billionth time he has steal equipped
[6:44:17] <%rytyoung> Pat you should has steal equipped if not
[6:44:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> We should make sure he has Steal equppied
[6:44:30] <%JumbleJams> @rytyoung he has it
[6:44:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> Don't overdo it. *Proceeds to uppercut NOTHING*
[6:44:37] <%Jekado> this feels very vermintide. waiting for something then killing rats.
[6:44:37] <%Buzzard42> I genuinely love how much of Midgar has been expanded on
[6:44:39] <+rytyoung> @jumblejams then all is in order
[6:44:45] <%Dragon_Batman> Yea I like the added stuff, cuz some of these places were just like 2 or 3 hallways
[6:44:48] <%TimetodiveLTX> is steal still a random chance or is it consistent
[6:44:50] <%espanishcanamurciana> if you open the stats Tifa has a higher attack than Cloud and she's using her fists SeemsGood
[6:44:51] <%Keyd00d> Pat unequip steal
[6:44:59] <%weissguard> Tifa is giving me some Jude Mathis flashbacks with that run speed.
[6:45:00] <%Alazull> Gosh dang bitch ghosts!
[6:45:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @rytyoung But what if he DOESN'T?!
[6:45:01] <%Firgof> This game makes me *fear* the Weapon Fights
[6:45:05] <%floralkami> guys, Pat already has Steal equipped. keep bringing it up, and he might take it off just to fuck with us
[6:45:06] <%maximemeretrax> Pat steal my virginity
[6:45:06] <%rytyoung> @timetodiveltx Random chance, but will proq eventually
[6:45:17] <%rytyoung> @king_wolf_rigger THEN ALL IS IN DISORDER
[6:45:23] <%Dragon_Batman> @TimetodiveLTX It is random and based off luck, there is a chance up if an enemy is pressured or staggered
[6:45:25] <%Firgof> I don't want to fucking know what it's going to take to bring down Emerald Weapon in this combat system
[6:45:34] <%Valdorick> OOPS! All Immune
[6:45:36] <%Buzzard42> psaDab
[6:45:39] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[6:45:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Oh no! Not DISORDER!
[6:45:42] <%mechslayer71> @firgof Your first born child
[6:45:45] <%Andrizzleton> damn that move doesn't track?
[6:45:59] <%TimetodiveLTX> gotcha
[6:46:02] <%코코꾸라> @Firgof Do you know the ADamantoise fight on FFXV?
[6:46:08] <%rytyoung> It's the WORST kind of order!
[6:46:12] <%lord_traxis> Switching to easy difficulty will leave Emerald spinning
[6:46:14] <%Dragon_Batman> Weirdly this fight beat my ass for a bit
[6:46:14] <%Valdorick> What a fuck nut
[6:46:23] <%hzealot> he existed just to troll pat
[6:46:29] <%Firgof> @mechslayer71 "Step One: Acquire Vincent. Step Two: Savescum until Lucky Shot does something Useful Step Three: Try not to Die Step Four: Die A Lot"
[6:46:33] <%ringabal> YOU DIDN'T WIN
[6:46:34] <%Alazull> I really wish there was Added Effect to link with Steal so you could just steal with your basic attacks
[6:46:34] <%Hellarussian> haw can it be
[6:46:42] <%Axellogic> This fight isnt so bad til it starts running away all the time
[6:46:44] <%prism_zet> @Dragon_Batman yeah getting swarmed can circle jerk you pretty good
[6:46:45] <%Daniel_Is_I> The ambient music here reminds me a lot of the back alley of nier automata's amusement park
[6:46:46] <@SoFarFetched> That really sweeped her off her feet LUL
[6:46:51] <%TimetodiveLTX> same
[6:46:55] <%Valdorick> Can see the explosions on the tower.
[6:46:56] <%Firgof> @코코꾸라 I do, and it's part of what makes me worried

[6:47:45] <%Keyd00d> oh no the console
[6:47:45] <%prism_zet> @Alazull old steal upgraded to mug when it leveled up, i miss the materia duplicating when it levelled over max,
[6:47:50] <%ospreyworks> Wow those textures.
[6:47:55] <%Firgof> I really think what's going on here is the LoD engine is failing to update/work in places
[6:47:56] <%j0ustar> SOULNADO POWERED TRAIN
[6:48:00] <%TimetodiveLTX> i'm not fucking ready for this
[6:48:00] <%weissguard> Oof those textures.
[6:48:02] <%Alazull> @SH1NK1R0 You right
[6:48:02] <%Firgof> So the higher-quality meshes/textures are just failing to load
[6:48:08] <%StaceMcGate> MORALLY GREY
[6:48:10] <%JojoPiero> Man, knowing the like, purposes of shit
[6:48:11] <%j0ustar> tseng my boi!
[6:48:12] <%Keyd00d> Thank God there's subs
[6:48:19] <%JojoPiero> I didn't think they'd be SOULNADO
[6:48:23] <%JojoPiero> That's sick
[6:48:25] <%AzureGale> Flashback!
[6:48:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Its a common thing with Unreal Engine, Jedi Fall Order had the exact same issue
[6:48:39] <%Ancopro> yo tifa's freakin out i love it
[6:48:43] <%ChaosAethr> STILL REALLY EVIL TO DO THAT
[6:48:46] <%toastybites> Was Tseng always this much of an ass
[6:48:50] <%Firgof> Yes
[6:48:52] <%ospreyworks> yeah
[6:48:55] <%floralkami> yes
[6:48:56] <%ospreyworks> he slapped Aerith
[6:49:01] <%weissguard> Pretty sure, yeah.
[6:49:03] <%Hellarussian> run it back
[6:49:03] <%maximemeretrax> I shouldn’t like Tseng but I wanna bone him
[6:49:03] <%ringabal> GREY MORALITY
[6:49:04] <%Keyd00d> Tseng is big evil
[6:49:04] <%tigerfang86> HUGE EVIL BUT LIKE LESS EVIL
[6:49:04] <%rytyoung> well you won't be if you're FUCKING AROUND WITH GHOST TRAINS
[6:49:05] <%hzealot> damn ottomans
[6:49:07] <%Daniel_Is_I> HIS NAME IS RUDE
[6:49:10] <%tigerfang86> TSENG IS LIKE HUGE EVIL THO
[6:49:10] <%Daniel_Is_I> OF COURSE HE'S EVIL
[6:49:11] <%Hellarussian> they're too close man
[6:49:14] <%ImmaCanuck> GREY EVIL
[6:49:14] <%JohnAtDawn> Tseng in Crisis Core being nice to Zack was so weird
[6:49:16] <@commanderclaw> But they're all hot, so they're morally grey at worst
[6:49:20] <%hzealot> rude is a good boi and i will not have you say otherwise
[6:49:20] <%spiritofmojave> well they're evil but for A PRICE. Tseng is just THE BIG EVIL
[6:49:21] <%Firgof> Tseng is evil and Hojo is *mega-evil*.
[6:49:22] <%Alazull> Tseng is pragmatically evil
[6:49:25] <%SH1NK1R0> Tseng has always been pure business over morals
[6:49:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Seriously, though. I would play an FF7 spinoff about Reno and Rude.
[6:49:27] <%IntrepidEye> Tseng is full orders are orders
[6:49:31] <%toastybites> I remember Crisis Core Tseng better than FF7 Tseng to be honest
[6:49:32] <%Maids4lyfe> I always thought Reno and Rude were evil
[6:49:32] <%j0ustar> Tseng is just trying his best
[6:49:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol I can't believe the Unreal Engine is still trash at loading textures. It's like how the Souls games never fix their problems.
[6:49:38] <%Pyroclase> It's interesting that they're using the Crisis Core black hawks
[6:49:40] <%spiritofmojave> The Pay Me evil
[6:49:41] <%rytyoung> and MONEY
[6:49:41] <%hzealot> rude is sensible at least
[6:49:41] <%NovaKnightmare> Good soldiers follow orders
[6:49:42] <%Hellarussian> money cool
[6:49:44] <%maximemeretrax> Tseng has a Dick ring for sure
[6:49:45] <%Valdorick> Tseng vs Cloud in a "Pay me" battle.
[6:49:46] <%Guardiansaiyan> Tseng: BUT THE MONEY THO!
[6:49:46] <%Alazull> Tseng is like fuck innocent lives get money
[6:49:46] <%hzealot> reno comes around to it
[6:49:47] <%AlteisenReiseZ> It's Corporate Evil, Job's gotta be done by someone and they're the guys to do it
[6:49:52] <%optimasmaximas> SourPls

[6:51:24] <%hzealot> this would be good to farm 200% stagger on

[6:51:56] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Umbrella just does Bioweapons, Shinra does Bioweapons + Tons of evil shit
[6:51:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Apparently you missed a chest
[6:52:01] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> C HES T
[6:52:05] <+Remery_> When the healer suddenly does the most dps in the party because she unlocks the laser beam
[6:52:07] <%Keyd00d> wrong way
[6:52:08] <%j0ustar> The Turks are all just "Pay me we do it" not necesarilly evil just workin' men that have done too much to stop now
[6:52:09] <%TalisKanju> GO BACK FOR THE CHEST
[6:52:11] <%lord_traxis> Isn't Umbrella more incompetent than evil? Like, they're evil, but if their stuff didn't screw up, they'd cause a LOT less collateral damage. Shinra's literally killing the planet for money
[6:52:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Don't forget to equip Steal
[6:52:19] <%maximemeretrax> @xerosigmaprime there are good shinra people though

[6:53:48] <%ospreyworks> Just call him Carlos Strife.
[6:53:55] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Firgof Same as Umbrella. RE3 has hospital staff working for Umbrella without knowing the whole truth
[6:54:03] <%sniffy77> i always wonder how much bounty hunters ir hired goons get paid in fiction.

[7:04:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @mechslayer71 They made some sick fucking monsters. Monsters in mako reactor, recreating alien bioweapons (Jenova), leaving exposed reactors irradiate and mutate monsters (reactor by Gongaga). Hojo literally makes the Nibelheim mansion a stuff of nightmares

[7:05:37] <%Keyd00d> Aerith is the mvp of this fight
[7:05:37] <%Firgof> I'm really curious to know if Vincent will still be a Completely Missable and Optional Character
[7:05:38] <%mechslayer71> @xerosigmaprime I haven’t played the original so I haven’t seen all that stuff yet. But idk man, none of that shit sounds as insidious as the T and G viruses. I guess I haven’t seen it in detail but still

[7:06:28] <%rytyoung> ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA
[7:06:30] <%TalisKanju> @mechslayer71 True, but Umbrella didn't kill those people just to blame someone else for it
[7:06:34] <%mechslayer71> Coulda summoned shiva @patstaresat
[7:06:42] <%Alazull> Lore is that he is the dude killing the kids who become the ghosts in the Train Graveyard
[7:06:56] <%Nupinoop296> did he say "BAM"??
[7:07:02] <%ImmaCanuck> "Reduced" LUL

[7:07:12] <%Alazull> Emeril Strife
[7:07:12] <%toastybites> I love this Tekken bullshit
[7:07:17] <%JojoPiero> Ifrit summon is doing as much as Ifrit-egi, boss is being tanked around in a circle so he just spends the time moving instead of attacking
[7:07:22] <%Visorak6> lizzard is legitimately terrible
[7:07:23] <%optimasmaximas> @Nupinoop296 yeah. there's little lines like thsat in the game
[7:07:25] <%Sir_stride> Ice fucking sucks in this game
[7:07:31] <%tigerfang86> ASSHOLE
[7:07:35] <%Wolfstriker121> HOLY SHIT
[7:07:36] <%mechslayer71> @taliskanju that’s true, but it doesn’t really make much difference to me. It was still made with the express purpose of killing people.

[7:08:15] <%tigerfang86> ITS THAT DOG
[7:08:17] <%Valdorick> Blizzard does not seem to hit nearly hard enough considering its long cast animation followed by its long animation of not doing damage...
[7:08:17] <%dante_must_die_exe> huge big sad ghost
[7:08:18] <@SoFarFetched> Now Tifa just needs to do a FAMIFOO

[7:08:24] <%ImmaCanuck> Hey, it's that ghost.
[7:08:28] <%EldritchBee> these ghost look huggable
[7:08:29] <%Pyroclase> Wouldn't this section have way better dramatic value if they were fighting Shirna in the train graveyard isntead?
[7:08:30] <%JojoPiero> It's like in Fallout where you kill a dude with a leg shot and it fucks off into the horizon. "Right Leg Crippled PogChamp " as he gets fucking gibbed
[7:08:30] <%코코꾸라> back to the lifestream you go

[7:08:58] <%Guardiansaiyan> @TalisKanju these ghost died here...time ghost died in 1996
[7:08:59] <%Nupinoop296> but this is our house! :(
[7:09:03] <%KasiCrafter> Tifa kicked those ghosts so hard that they got exorcised.
[7:09:03] <%Firgof> @TalisKanju Can't answer that without spoilers
[7:09:04] <%mechslayer71> @taliskanju these ghosts come from lost children. Time ghosts come from Nomura’s balls

[7:09:13] <%spiritofmojave> this Aerith theme mix is tight
[7:09:17] <@SoFarFetched> @optimasmaximas It's a funny thing in Hi-Score Girl where people thought Guile was saying FAMIFOO instead of Sonic Boom in SF2 LUL
[7:09:19] <%reinbachthe3rd> EPIC LOOTZ

[7:09:31] <%ringabal> It's just a naginata
[7:09:32] <%floralkami> @taliskanju I think ghosts are spirits trapped outside of the lifestream, while the time ghosts are some kind of protectors of it
[7:09:33] <%suikudo> Aerith is like the best character
[7:09:33] <%Sir_stride> hello? this staff can cut a bitcj
[7:09:35] <%Alazull> Is good staff

[7:09:52] <%ospreyworks> weird
[7:09:52] <%KasiCrafter> Stopping projectiles sounds BUSTED.
[7:09:52] <%Alazull> Aerith is the power house of the cell
[7:09:52] <%beepbeepbopbop> It's a good take on an offensive caster
[7:09:53] <%TalisKanju> @floralkami I like that explanation
[7:09:54] <%Big_Dream> they all due
[7:09:54] <%j0ustar> A stick with duct-taped knives nice

[7:09:57] <%Dragon_Batman> Funny Barret still has his 2 guns
[7:09:58] <%Keyd00d> I think everyone has the same amount of weapons in the end

[7:10:03] <%optimasmaximas> @SoFarFetched lmao, i still need to watch that
[7:10:09] <%beepbeepbopbop> Since magic can be seen as boring to play
[7:10:12] <%tigerfang86> tons of crit bonuses
[7:10:22] <@SoFarFetched> definitely a good thing to watch SeemsGood
[7:10:30] <%ringabal> Mmmm this song hits the good spots
[7:10:32] <%Nobrev> we haven't even seen my favorite aerith skill yet
[7:10:34] <%beepbeepbopbop> I think you can get the full soundtrack late May
[7:10:35] <%floralkami> @taliskanju it would also fall in line with the whole thing going on with Jessie's dad
[7:10:36] <%spiritofmojave> @VashyronM hope they put out the digital mix soooon
