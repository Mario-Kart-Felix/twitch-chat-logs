[1:31:49] <+CelioHogane> @SH1NK1R0 actually, there is a Moogle summon on the game, so they ARE real.

[1:33:10] <+CaptainJax> neeeerd

[1:33:13] <tactician0> cause it stupid
[1:33:13] <Dr_Mooose> reading eww
[1:33:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because Tedtalks are often rediculus bullshit
[1:33:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE WHITEST STREAM ON TWITCH LUL
[1:33:16] <%cervidaequus> Greased cloud lightning
[1:33:16] <%JohnAtDawn> Have you ever actually seen a Cloud/Lightning ship? I've only seen one.

[1:33:22] <%PadreHail> DESTINY IS DESTINY
[1:33:22] <+evilpaul13> Isn't Cloud in drag basically Lightning?
[1:33:23] <seaechiowai> I know where you are going with this and I don't like it
[1:33:25] <BlueSpartan119> Ted Talk
[1:33:26] <ginblades> Iced Earth?
[1:33:28] <%de1ete_forever> Women are allowed to read?
[1:33:29] <%indig0bird> Because we were forced to watch TED talks in shitty "Entreperneurship" classes
[1:33:32] <FloresIsDead> wish I could read
[1:33:32] <%Yummy_Nukes> Cloud "Thunder Head" Strife
[1:33:32] <%suikudo> Because you werent using real sentences!

[1:33:48] <%ryome> What we tell you about reading Paige!?
[1:33:48] <dan_g_v> because Ted talks tend to run into the "kinda bad" area more often than not. Just ask Anita about her Ted Talk
[1:33:48] <%j0ustar> Paige needs more ram
[1:33:51] <%suikudo> i cant... what?

[1:34:55] <+geary28> Hell House could absolutely be tonight unless this is like a 2 hour stream
[1:34:55] <%Meow0369> I hope they have morph materia in part 8 when we get there in 30 years
[1:34:58] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Zombrocom taxes
[1:35:00] <bestwaifuritsu> @PatStaresAt Ramuh isnt in the game but Bahamut is for some reason despite being originally obtainable in the temple of the ancients way later
[1:35:00] <TDAWS_MP132> Why Reset?
[1:35:03] <%Fenrirlives> @patstaresat maybe you can get the church materia now?
[1:35:03] <+Superbro64> I don't you even loose anything from highlighting your message. Other than your dignity

[1:55:02] <Daskolin> Also Cait Sith is a robot. So any dong mods you can im... I stop here
[1:55:10] <hassanico2> @GarbageQueenEllie Oh those people are just dumb and refuse to actually pay attention to the real themes
[1:55:11] <%PadreHail> Man I would not be surprised if Final Fantasy House Remake is a thing

[1:55:25] <seaechiowai> anyone here know what time Max's stream will be?
[1:55:28] <mothdude> Naoto had the literal sex change dungeon
[1:55:29] <ODSTEvan147> hey guys
[1:55:29] <+CelioHogane> @Daskolin so Cait Sith is actually a Sex Toy... excelent news everybody
[1:55:38] <%weissguard> @GarbageNirvana lol my bad, wrong person
[1:55:44] <dan_g_v> if Max streams, he would start around 5 hours from now
[1:55:45] <MaritimeSpanker> WOuld you buy a Caith sith sex doll?
[1:55:46] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @PettyFunk I'm more of a tea guy but Im willing to drink some. I tried to nap 3 hours ago and only got 20 minuets @dan_g_v
[1:55:47] <%optimasmaximas> cait sith is a furry
[1:55:52] <%PadreHail> Max is already streaming plenty in his pants, I have no clue what time he's on though
[1:56:02] <bestwaifuritsu> cait sith is a stuffed robot, Reeve is the furry.
[1:56:05] <%SweetCheeksPlays> hey everyone!
[1:56:13] <%SweetCheeksPlays> How white has Pat been this stream?
[1:56:15] <seaechiowai> @dan_g_v limesOK thanks mate VoHiYo

[1:56:38] <+Suplexsenpai> He raised the roof
[1:56:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Regardless, Naoto rocks that dorky english look. Just pure amazing
[1:56:38] <+UnwoundCaesar70> i think Max is like 15 hours in
[1:56:38] <Mexrage> question, what chapter is pat on?
[1:56:46] <dan_g_v> Reeve is really living the furry life. He gets to go full VR with his fursuit and do any kind of stupid furry shit and nobody will be able to tell it is him
[1:56:52] <%weissguard> @GarbageQueenEllie True enough.
[1:56:52] <%PadreHail> He talked about how lit the game was and dabbed to the Hip Hop Chocobo theme
[1:56:54] <+CelioHogane> @TheFranss Max ended his first stream earlier than Pat, so Pat has Part 1 advantage.
[1:56:57] <TheFranss> Pat is on captin 8 right?
[1:56:59] <%walternatorz> I think pat has gone the pee poops
[1:57:01] <%PadreHail> Pat is on 8 yes
[1:57:11] <MaritimeSpanker> he slipped into the bowl and decided to take a bath in the water
[1:57:18] <%de1ete_forever> we are before Hell House and the playground talk
[1:57:18] <theredhairedtrainer> Pat dropped the TP roll again
[1:57:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Maybe Pat has been living in Hell House all along and is getting eaten.
[1:57:38] <dan_g_v> remember Pat needs to shed his clothes first and then hunt the toilet paper before he can start peeing

[2:02:04] <%moogleboy1984> Ice and Aero are NOTORIOUSLY bad for this

[2:02:29] <nikoloas_> looks like they have a barrier
[2:02:29] <%Louie_Salmon> Wind and ice are all that really do that
[2:02:31] <%Reaped_Psyche> Looks like these enemies have a shield
[2:02:32] <sendart> wonders if the enemies have a barrier
[2:02:32] <TheFranss> Maybe it's because spells have different mechanics to them? Like Ice's true damage comes from the ice 'splosion?
[2:02:36] <Explodincatz> FF Tactiocs was the best said someone
[2:02:36] <Viaquez> it looks like spells target where the enemy was at the time of cast, so enemies can just move out of the way?
[2:02:38] <%Madbearv> as always pat, just get good at this the dark souls of final fantasy games
[2:02:39] <%EuropanLamprey> we are colorful idiots

[2:03:08] <%superstarsage> I get the intent, like you're supposed to cast those spells while hitstunning with another character or when they're staggered but shields kindaaaa make that hard.
[2:03:10] <%bread_assassin> It also sucks that party member's ATB goes up at a glacial pace when you are not controlling them.

[2:08:10] <%SoFarFetched> @floralkami Twitch unfortunately gets fucky on Notifications so I put pat's notifications on his twitter. But yeah it's tough t rying to figure out who to watch and when during this time.
[2:08:11] <%Laecerelius> Too many childrens
[2:08:11] <%de1ete_forever> that's too many childs
[2:08:12] <%Shady_Squid> Cloud has killed hundreds of Shinra gaurds, why does he get to be indignant?
[2:08:15] <Coystick> No condoms are dick socks
[2:08:18] <+CelioHogane> @Daskolin well then whatever, just ban them
[2:08:19] <WarchiefGoldva> Childrens are the worst.
[2:08:19] <%moogleboy1984> Kill. All. The. BABIES
[2:08:25] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Only weapons show on your character right?
[2:08:26] <%walternatorz> a couple missing children aren't going to be missed
[2:08:33] <%Meow0369> Oh no better delete a whole function because like 1 person might bypass automod
[2:08:34] <dan_g_v> if you blow this area, you can find the children without risk of them escaping
[2:08:36] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Daskolin I think words can be banned no matter where
[2:08:36] <FloresIsDead> no U scared me child
[2:08:38] <+michingmallecho> You know chat, when you get the game, you can skip the side quests in your game 🌝

[2:27:00] <%THATGUY_789> Pat was born confused
[2:27:00] <+michingmallecho> Tomino would approve of this hate of the old
[2:27:02] <FloresIsDead> be nice to kids so you can shake them down later when they get money

[2:27:07] <seaechiowai> No Midgar for Old Men
[2:27:08] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He was forcing the old man to give the key back himself

[2:27:21] <ThePimpGuin> being nie to the young and shitty to the old, its like a 3/5th compromise
[2:27:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> The old man says he can't move around.
[2:27:22] <%RedKnightVI> He was trying to motivate him to keep going, and not give up. It's stupid.
[2:27:23] <+DiabloDeAzul> Read the fine print pat
[2:27:23] <%Meow0369> he was telling the old man to do it himself
[2:27:23] <%JohnAtDawn> He didnt want the old man to give up

[3:56:31] <+stuntdoublejesus> @lotharrio no
[3:56:37] <+zetastriker> Anyone else think Aerith sounds like Zepla, the FFXIV youtuber?
[3:56:38] <WarchiefGoldva> Yo for real, she just did a buncha damage with that shit.
[3:56:42] <ChloeFleurage> a reason to use items you say?
[3:56:43] <CuttleCrow> GOTTA PUMP UP THE ATTACK THOUGH
[3:56:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> use aerith's butt as a meat shield
[3:56:44] <$lotharrio> Thank god. It's the only thing that matters.
[3:56:56] <Tealhollow1> I think hard mode doesn't allow items so it's crazy tough
[3:56:57] <%luckysteak> why is one made up name better than the other? they are both awkward to say
[3:57:06] <%Tearonex> WHO'S READY FOR ANOTHER BANGER OF A SONG
[3:57:15] <%spiritofmojave> meeeeee
[3:57:18] <%코코꾸라> It doesn't allow items at all
[3:57:20] <VidulaSaix> Nope, no items period
[3:57:20] <%floralkami> @garbagequeenellie how? there's barely any meat to shield with
[3:57:22] <+Superbro64> aerith's voice actor does have a gaming youtube channel, apparently. "Rebel-" something
[3:57:24] <$Dakuu75> doesn't his Buster Sword have like 4 slots now? but it only shows 2?
[3:57:24] <Monkeyweed21> did I miss Hell house yet?

[4:09:00] <%PadreHail> Hopefully Pat doesn't walk out of the bathroom flinging poop at Paige like a weird monkey dwarf

[4:11:54] <%UvBenServed> Shit posting is the best engagement
[4:11:58] <%TheActuallyGuy> So many rival fights in this game so far. I love it.
[4:12:01] <%PadreHail> Roche is actually the final boss and you have to fight him by swinging his motorbike at him
[4:12:06] <Sol_Install> It's ok Pat, shit talks are fine
[4:12:08] <%Zebroneath> You're doing fine, Pat, imo.
[4:12:11] <~PatStaresAt> your cat may be very nice jade and it is your duty to lvoe them more than elmo
[4:12:12] <%PadreHail> Then you get his bike as a bonus sword
[4:12:17] <reinbachthe3rd> Captain's Log, "Wow, this is a huge shit."

[4:12:50] <%suikudo> That just leaves Aerith or Yuffie and god i hope it aint Yuffie
[4:12:54] <seaechiowai> shitposting is funposting
[4:12:55] <YakumoYomi> Is Pat literally "shit-posting" right now? This is the content I crave.
[4:12:56] <%Hellarussian> what is Elmos fluff to chonk ratio?
[4:12:56] <Sokumotanaka> You get his bike as a bonus sword LUL

[4:16:57] <vaderxyz1970> Any else amazed that Paige sounds extactly like Arieth
[4:16:57] <%suikudo> Im dying
[4:17:01] <seaechiowai> internet was a military invention, ergo shitposting is a weapon

[4:17:19] <%Hellarussian> farting is just burping from your butt

[4:17:46] <T_Sasquatch> @hellarussian that's a fact
[4:17:56] <%Zebroneath> Im still surprised you get sponsors from the amount of shit you, Woolie, and Paige collectively say.
[4:17:57] <lockhead45> wonder when we will have even smaller pats running around
[4:17:58] <%tumzfestival> @Hellarussian Isn't that why you get to decide?.... Just me?
[4:18:00] <YakumoYomi> Oh shit...is it time for the B L O O D P O O L already?!

[4:18:08] <the_alphonse> poop is all three states of matter
[4:18:11] <%necrocannibal2> Pat is probably wiping right now
[4:18:14] <%tumzfestival> Bloodpool? sounds metal
[4:18:16] <Coystick> Diarrhea is just ass-flu
[4:18:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PadreHail Woolie should come over to Pats stream and help out
[4:18:18] <%sund0wner> Back to front.
[4:18:20] <%PadreHail> Pat the retcon ghosts will make sure your poop goes into the toilet but they can't protect you from the splash
[4:18:22] <%suikudo> Poop is just Human ice
[4:18:30] <%sund0wner> Poop is malleable though

[4:19:38] <%suikudo> Pat has been taking grown man shits since he was 7
[4:19:43] <%tumzfestival> How long has this chat been pretty seriously discussing SHIT?!
[4:19:45] <%suikudo> Thats why he strips
[4:19:48] <+peri_d0t> @Hellarussian please no
[4:19:55] <CuttleCrow> when will Pat be brave enough to install the toilet under the gamer cube?
[4:19:56] <$Dakuu75> @tumzfestival since the START of the break
[4:19:58] <%spiritofmojave> @tumzfestival it never started, and never ended
[4:20:00] <%Guardiansaiyan> @tumzfestival 5 iminutes
[4:20:02] <%supergoblinpunch> They're fucking on a pile of Raid: Shadow legends cash
[4:20:02] <%PadreHail> Fun fact I'm also a crazy person and whenever I go to any public toilet I always mummify the toilet seat with tp even if I have a full bladder just so I don't have to sit on someone else's fecal germs
[4:20:05] <~PatStaresAt> hey chat im dun pooping getting ready for food now
[4:20:07] <%Hellarussian> do you take shits? Or do they take you?
[4:20:09] <the_alphonse> pats been taking old man shits since he was 8
[4:20:13] <%tumzfestival> I wanted a list of answers, thank you hehe
[4:20:15] <%SoFarFetched> Pat is fully relieved of poop
[4:20:19] <%necrocannibal2> that was actually kinda fast
[4:20:19] <%Guardiansaiyan> @PatStaresAt I don't believe you
[4:20:22] <%suikudo> Did you wash your hands before or after you send that @PatStaresAt
[4:20:23] <%UvBenServed> Did you make the bidet noise?
[4:20:23] <+superkeaton> @PatStaresAt rooHug
[4:20:24] <%necrocannibal2> maybe I'm just a slow pooper though
[4:20:24] <%weissguard> Stuff goes in, stuff comes out.
[4:20:31] <%spiritofmojave> Shouldn't you food THEN dump?
[4:20:36] <YakumoYomi> The tank is empty, and must now be refilled.
[4:20:38] <%PadreHail> Like every time I have to poo at work on break I spend like 5 minutes just covering the seat
[4:20:38] <%tumzfestival> @weissguard that's what popp concerns all about
[4:20:43] <Coystick> Thank you for the valuable, disgusting update, chief.
[4:20:44] <+Remery_> He poop to empty his stomach to fill it back up with more food to poop again. The madman! :D
[4:20:44] <%de1ete_forever> Food go in, poop come out, that's what Pat Stares At is all about
[4:20:48] <Aydarkzero> gotta make room Kappa
[4:20:49] <%thegreenbenis> EAT MY FIBER PAT, JESUS
[4:20:53] <%thegreenbenis> MORE*
[4:20:57] <~PatStaresAt> thank you deleterfrover
[4:21:08] <%necrocannibal2> @thegreenbenis uhm...
[4:21:11] <MoreLukewarm> eat thegreenbenis's fiber
[4:21:15] <CuttleCrow> eat his fiber
[4:21:16] <$Dakuu75> Pat should /clear the chat lol
[4:21:20] <%tumzfestival> Hey Pat, we've been talking about POOP nonstop
[4:21:29] <%Guardiansaiyan> Oops ALL POOP
[4:21:29] <%PadreHail> Mudbutt Pat, Mudbutt Pat, Mudbutt Pat and his poopy butt cat
[4:21:30] <%thegreenbenis> More fiber.
[4:21:32] <+Remery_> Poop talk is better than vomit talk :)
[4:21:32] <%suikudo> Elevate this process while eating with a stream setup on the toilet so food can go in as poop go out
[4:21:36] <Coystick> A mouthful of greenbenis a day helps keep you regular
[4:21:38] <%Hellarussian> the logistics of pooping is an important conversation
[4:21:42] <MoreLukewarm> poop poop poop poop poop poop
[4:21:42] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Remery_ why did you remind chat?
[4:21:44] <%tumzfestival> @Dakuu75 WIPE IT perhaps?!
[4:21:48] <%Guardiansaiyan> Vomit vomit vomit
[4:21:52] <$Dakuu75> ffffffffff....
[4:21:56] <ChloeFleurage> Pat Brappin' it up in chat
[4:21:58] <%weissguard> psaBig psaHoldon
[4:21:59] <%tumzfestival> IM OUIT
[4:22:02] <~PatStaresAt> I hate how things come out of my body why can't I just eat less and go like once a year
[4:22:02] <%spiritofmojave> @remery_ long as we don't have a podcast where Woolie talks about catching poop in a shirt
[4:22:06] <CuttleCrow> when you eat a lot of different food colorings and your poop comes out like a rainbow
[4:22:11] <+Remery_> @Guardiansaiyan nah they wont remember too worried about the poop
[4:22:12] <%tumzfestival> THESE THINGS!!!
[4:22:14] <%PadreHail> I bet you Kitase-san is pooping along with the stream
[4:22:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Crunchberries are the worst part of Captain Crunch.
[4:22:16] <Meekest> Just let the bidet do its work
[4:22:17] <%Guardiansaiyan> @Remery_ true
[4:22:19] <getinthetent> @PatStaresAt that would be super painful
[4:22:26] <~PatStaresAt> yeah but it'd be once a year
[4:22:28] <%weissguard> That's how you get a gaping asshole PAT!
[4:22:29] <MoreLukewarm> Install a colonic machine in your house
[4:22:31] <ChloeFleurage> can't I just have a portal in my butt that teleports the poop into the sun instead of having to shit
[4:22:32] <+Remery_> @spiritofmojave I wanna hear that story tho
[4:22:43] <%suikudo> Rainbow poops would make your butt look like the portal to fairyland
[4:22:52] <CuttleCrow> colonoscopy bag when?
[4:22:55] <~PatStaresAt> yeah Chloe that's the stuff
[4:23:00] <%spiritofmojave> @remery_ small part of me feels that, sameeeeee
[4:23:03] <Flarepulse> Pat should just meld his body into the plumbing
[4:23:04] <%UvBenServed> Just shit in your girlfriend's purse
[4:23:10] <GiygasDrillBreak> it wouldnt be called poop, it would be called Patrician Boivonite
[4:23:11] <%j0ustar> Pat even if you were a brain in a jar you would still produce waste matter
[4:23:14] <%suikudo> Oh god a poopy sun would give us all pink eye
[4:23:15] <This_is_Marco> Be like a sloth, they poo like once a week

[4:46:23] <hassanico2> @Wrashis No problem. We gotta pick up the slack to avoid the copyright thing.
[4:46:24] <This_is_Marco> was there a choice?
[4:46:25] <%Alazull> She doesn't want you seeing that Honeybee Inn dawg
[4:46:26] <%코코꾸라> She did say before that the main way through the shortcut was close
[4:46:27] <+zepelinnn1> she said it was a shorcut when she was a kid

[4:46:54] <hassanico2> Does it sound like the music is saying "F F EEEEEIGHT"?
[4:47:09] <$lotharrio> Maybe the ladders are normally down, but the bandits and so on raised them cause they wanted a hideout and didn't want girls or dames to intrude.

[4:56:29] <%collind99> @floralkami I think that people mistake MCU Spider-Man getting the aesthetics of spider man down (someone who looks like a teenager in high school, awkward but quips a lot, etc.) for it getting the tone and themes of Spider-Man. I think SM2 gets those things, which matter more to me imo.

[5:23:39] <%ape_hawk> you can only refocus once per battle
[5:23:42] <%j0ustar> 2 birds 1 chonk
[5:23:45] <Nupinoop296> one borb, one stone
[5:23:45] <WarchiefGoldva> I wish Chadley died of cancer.

[5:24:09] <dan_g_v> may we need Tifa's punchers for this?
[5:24:10] <the_alphonse> @PatStaresAt so is this game a good starting point for final fantasy? I've never played any
[5:24:19] <TastySammiches> BEEG chocobo
[5:24:21] <bigdumbidiotguy> I think I blocked maybe 5 times my entire playthrough on normal
[5:24:21] <%SH1NK1R0> Its a great limit for tifa actually since it lets you spam
[5:24:26] <Aydarkzero> @dan_g_v you can two man it
[5:24:33] <Trinity5> @the_alphonse yeah
[5:24:44] <hassanico2> DOINK
[5:24:44] <Onmi_Khaos> I mean @the_alphonse Almost every FF is different than the others in some way or another so... yeah any of them are good starting points
[5:24:45] <SpookySpaghooti> @the_alphonse it's closest to the new games, so everything after 10.
[5:24:46] <The_Dark_Gods> GET AWAY FROM HER
[5:24:53] <%ryome> Maybe he’ll dodge?

[5:25:10] <boxofhooligans> Kreygasm
[5:25:10] <+BigCoffee> @the_alphonse no because it assumes you know the original game and all the extra material
[5:25:17] <Treuan> come on and ride this Chocobo!
[5:25:18] <%AllenDeadman> tonberries are scary
[5:25:25] <bigdumbidiotguy> all the bosses are absolute tanks in this game.

[5:28:18] <MildMannered_Creighton> FIRELORD IS BACK
[5:28:22] <+hod_fareview> I love how the chocobo does not give a single FCUK about Ifrit LUL

[5:28:25] <%AllenDeadman> OH LAWD HE ROLLIN
[5:28:25] <kofumugi> man i wanna go get some KFC now
[5:28:26] <framewindowcleaner> Pat, you have to use the summon abilities
[5:28:30] <%Faustgesicht> The most dangerous Primal: Fat Chocobo
[5:28:31] <+Ollie_the_Orphan> The secret KFC raid boss is a fucking beast
[5:28:31] <%Typhaeon> Extra crispy
[5:28:35] <Trinity5> ya'll remember that ff14 kfc fat chocobo shit LUL
[5:28:40] <$lotharrio> La Bomba...
[5:28:43] <Aydarkzero> what if the Chocobo just fully healed it self Kappa
[5:28:44] <%floralkami> @the_alphonse every FF game is different in mechanics, so I suggest researching the systems and see what battle system you would enjoy grinding through more with. I personally say original FF7 cause I like the active system, but it also has the "recommended" classic turn base and the easier wait system too.
[5:28:51] <%Typhaeon> KFC raid was the funniest shit
[5:28:56] <%spiritofmojave> FRY HIS BUTT
[5:28:56] <%Typhaeon> Too bad it was China only
[5:29:00] <marvinbrewton25> The most amazing thing in this whole fight is that chocobos life bar it hardly moves after a full round of fighting
[5:29:00] <%zk_nails> cook that bird
[5:29:02] <%olsenpaint> psaGib

[5:29:39] <%king_wragles> Oh god, he's letting the potato wedges stack
[5:29:40] <Trinity5> you have to reestablish hatred on this chicken sandwich
[5:29:42] <ChloeFleurage> nah
[5:29:42] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[5:29:53] <%floralkami> @the_alphonse you should start with any FF from 7 up to 10
[5:29:53] <%Wolfstriker121> wtf?!

[5:30:31] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Tonberries and Cactaurs. amazing
[5:30:31] <$Dakuu75> OH SHIT Refocus gave Cloud 3 ATB
[5:30:36] <%floralkami> @treuan it's not a spoiler, it's in the trailer.

[5:31:38] <%king_wragles> @PatStaresAt I thought he was a Shinra mark?
[5:31:38] <%SH1NK1R0> Refocus gives 3rd atb and makes them smaller so they are earned faster
[5:31:38] <BoneofMalkav> The True Hellhouse was the Friends we made along the way :)
[5:31:40] <%TalisKanju> FUCK OFF Chadley

[5:36:08] <+ScrapSentinel> @heartlesshealer you're more likely to use it if you can magnify it, cuz now you don't have to do it three damn times
[5:36:10] <ODSTEvan147> good cat
[5:36:12] <ChloeFleurage> cat owners know the pain of being constantly covered in scratches and puncture wounds
[5:36:13] <heartlesshealer> Elmo hates barrier
[5:36:17] <Dr_Mooose> Elmo show no mercy
[5:36:19] <agadejobi> So is Elmo just a huge cat, is Pat smaller than I think he is, or both?
[5:36:20] <$lotharrio> That cat is pissed at Pat. Look at the tail.
[5:36:26] <%narusao> they're love wounds
[5:36:27] <$hzealot> what a crazy noise bizarre town
[5:36:28] <theog_rb> "Why is he mad??" we'll literally never know and neither will Elmo
[5:36:28] <+Emrldt> both

[5:36:40] <transporterthesequel> @agadejobi Yes
[5:36:43] <lockhead45> Honeybee Inn and Hell House are legit the best parts of this game lets hope Pat doesnt blue ball us
[5:36:43] <%ape_hawk> i forget, does the elemental materia work on cure?
[5:36:54] <tactician0> nope

[5:36:58] <%ape_hawk> hmm
[5:36:58] <heroicspiritavenger> “Why is he mad” WHY DO YOU THINK, IF YOU HAD SENSE YOU’D BE MAD TOO
[5:36:59] <AncyentMarinere> I just fought hell house he’s fucking TOUGH
[5:37:11] <%VashyronM> Only works with Lightning, Fire, Ice, and Wind
[5:37:18] <lockhead45> hell house identifies as a woman actually
[5:37:33] <%Guardiansaiyan> thinks PatStaresAt is Sponsored by Square Enix but without the PERKS imGlitch Kupo
[5:37:39] <marvinbrewton25> No seriously is summon materia just 1 meteria and all summons go in it or what?
[5:37:42] <%ledgefiendd> what would all-elemental do?
[5:37:49] <AncyentMarinere> She’s***
[5:37:52] <NiktenKing> Nothing
[5:37:52] <cosmicgoatee> Back and forth and late end into this im sure the switchouts will be ridiculous
[5:37:54] <%VashyronM> nothing
[5:37:57] <+Overlordkain> which is why you will regret not keeping revival equip for most of the game
[5:37:57] <%ledgefiendd> awwww
[5:37:59] <%ape_hawk> no
[5:38:04] <+ScrapSentinel> @marvinbrewton25 several materias, each weapon gets a DEDICATED slot so it doesn't take space for materia you want
[5:38:08] <Birdigalore> @PatStaresAt White Wind was a group heal so kinda
[5:38:09] <$lotharrio> Healing Wind or something, I think.
[5:38:10] <%Ascethetic> @PatStaresAt dteal
[5:38:12] <%ledgefiendd> what if it made it so your swings hit everyone tho
[5:38:12] <%Ascethetic> steal*
[5:38:13] <%RyanTheRecluse> what summons has pat got so far?
[5:38:14] <%CalebHatesGames> @marvinbrewton25 There are separate Summon Materia, but they share the same gauge in combat
[5:38:16] <HisEvilDomain> was I the only one to clip Elmo's rampage of terror?
[5:38:18] <marvinbrewton25> AH tyvm
[5:38:21] <%JD_Lars> If you have to fight Knights of the Round that will be a shit show
[5:38:21] <%floralkami> @marvinbrewton25 no, it's on a separate slot, one for each party member.
[5:38:23] <%CursedNobleman> This episode of Cloud gets sat on by a fat chocobo is sponsored by sqeenix
[5:38:25] <Monkeyweed21> CUMBO
[5:38:32] <TastySammiches> chonkobo
[5:38:34] <NiktenKing> Steall all would be cool
[5:38:35] <reinbachthe3rd> FAT CHOKE
[5:38:38] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Are there links larger then 2 for materia in this game?
[5:38:39] <%Typhaeon> I'm a sucker for underdog weapons so I'd use Nail Bat and fish for crits with a buncha Luck Up
[5:38:42] <%SH1NK1R0> Each character has 1 summon slot and each summon is a separate one.
[5:38:43] <+ScrapSentinel> imagine fighting Knights of the Round aeroLUL
[5:38:47] <Explodincatz> can u swap weapons mid combat?
[5:38:48] <%moogleboy1984> Can't wait to get to Junon underground so I can spam mastered HP Plus Materia for a gorillion gil
[5:38:50] <+Plankman> he's not equipped to think this hard!

[5:38:57] <Monkeyweed21> Pat are you an idiot?
[5:38:59] <TDAWS_MP132> you took out the accessory ones again
[5:39:14] <ChloeFleurage> when pat's brain panics he dumps all important info and the ability to process data

[5:39:27] <%Plankman> Plankman subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[5:39:38] <Monkeyweed21> cumbo is dumbo
[5:39:39] <%moogleboy1984> this game needs Materia loadouts in the worst possible way
[5:39:43] <$lotharrio> ...why?
[5:39:45] <Edible_Enthusiasm> oh. what.
[5:39:47] <bigdumbidiotguy> pray wasn't in the original. they've really done a good job to try and bring back clear job roles from previous games. Aerith is a Black/White mage combo, Tifa is a Monk, Barret is a long range tank and cloud is a knight.
