[0:26:39] <%Ranryu692> so Paige had crotch cobwebs
[0:26:39] <dan_g_v> vaginal bug
[0:26:41] <%BoxNavy> smart
[0:26:42] <Jnkolm> Is that like a regular spider but with Powdered sugar like a funnel cake?
[0:26:43] <%cervidaequus> Laundry line spiders are surprisingly common
[0:26:43] <$dalmek> and now I will too
[0:26:45] <+Shady_Zaku> Me too
[0:26:45] <DazzlingFuhrer> That's how I date.
[0:26:45] <AnneSQF> check the shorts for worms
[0:26:46] <%cowardman93> correct response paige
[0:26:46] <Shardlab> Nope.Nope.Nope.Nope.
[0:26:46] <TechGamer> This would only happen to you Paige, some how life finds away
[0:26:46] <TREEMAN9999> understandable
[0:26:49] <NMD_Ninja> not vagina rot WutFace
[0:26:49] <+mr_drucifer> somehow that ended worse than I could have imagined
[0:26:49] <%goatbait> Check your crotch for spiders
[0:26:49] <%BinaryFireball> I have had nightmares of spiders biting my dick
[0:26:50] <+Delenay> thats one of those life altering moments
[0:26:50] <%roscoe_rosaline> It will
[0:26:51] <+Shady_Zaku> Gotta check crotch
[0:26:52] <%Ipsenscastle> check burger for worms, check vagina for spiders
[0:26:52] <calibaniii> Makes more sense than WORMS IN THE BURGER
[0:26:52] <%BinaryFireball> its the worst
[0:26:52] <+vehementvadr> why is paige alive? how?
[0:26:54] <AluxStreams> Crotch damage is the worst.
[0:26:54] <dragon17013> It's more likely than you think SoBayed
[0:26:56] <Weeabooninja> Actual Vaginal Spiders
[0:26:56] <%BoxNavy> it WILL happen if you dont do that
[0:26:56] <%OffbeatMinority> Had a scorpion on my work shirt once, scared the shit out of me so I do the same thing now
[0:26:56] <%POUND_CAKE94> The scarier part is that they just live close enough to do that at EVERY MOMENT
[0:26:57] <%Movemeister> It’s more likely than you’d think
[0:26:57] <iosephe> this is more reasonable than the worms
[0:26:58] <Arek_1> NotLikeThis
[0:26:59] <verychillysquid> I do that too but for different reasons
[0:26:59] <%AzureGale> That would suuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[0:27:00] <%Arancet> there still could be INVISIBLE SPIDERS
[0:27:00] <+chosenjuan42> so new McDonald's worms
[0:27:00] <%Garthunox> despite being around the world
[0:27:02] <%YakumoYomi> Funnel webs are no joke
[0:27:05] <%Sausious> No it won't bitwe you, it'll just lay eggs in your vagina
[0:27:06] <%JoshManVGH> Check for burger worms and check for undie spiders.
[0:27:07] <%shurtal> "I always shake, and look at crotch." --Peachsaliava's Club Activities
[0:27:08] <%SaiyanShoto> I do the same because spiders hide in our pants here
[0:27:09] <+kumaprime> crotch spiders
[0:27:12] <%twistedj3ster> per pant
[0:27:16] <+takutoots> Australia is a constant battle royale with nature
[0:27:16] <aiutare47> Paige still checks hamburgers
[0:27:18] <marvel877> Check for worms, check for spiders, check for skeletons
[0:27:21] <blue8moon> When I was a kid I got bit by a spider on the inner thigh near my crotch, and I have hated spiders ever since
[0:27:24] <+Shady_Zaku> Time investment is WORTH IT for the Sanity Meter refill
[0:27:33] <+ThisIsLloyd> Tennesse has spiders that want to live in your shoes so you gotta check them before or else your gonna have a bad time
[0:27:33] <+Deekman> most people do
[0:27:34] <TallPixels> Hey lemme check out pat's stream. Paige: "-bite my vagina"
[0:27:36] <+oktavia_von> pagie's magical spider shorts
[0:27:37] <yourliteraldog> Crotch Spiders sounds like a STI

[0:27:58] <DazzlingFuhrer> "nice"
[0:27:59] <%Sausious> fucking australia
[0:27:59] <$TIME_PUNCHER> in Australia people were worried pythons would mistake toddlers for wallabies and eat them
[0:27:59] <%cowardman93> australia is a testament to man's ignorance
[0:28:00] <AluxStreams> man fuck australia
[0:28:01] <%Ranryu692> Australia doesn't seem worth it
[0:28:02] <%YakumoYomi> Agreed. The presence of spiders gives me a persistent DoT debuff
[0:28:03] <%whyskeywolfe> This sounds like a Montreal stripclub.
[0:28:04] <+cvp5127> pve country
[0:28:06] <+Deekman> redback spiders
[0:28:08] <%Bailey__gaming> Australia : It's Bullshit!
[0:28:09] <%AncelDeLambert> FUCK THAT CONTINENT
[0:28:12] <%JoshManVGH> @marvel877 the check for skeletons is the only one with hope
[0:28:14] <%Aeogard> what do vagina spiders have to do with bug fables
[0:28:15] <+Shady_Zaku> There's a reason all the criminals got sent to Australia
[0:28:15] <+AXL808> damn austrailia
[0:28:15] <%roscoe_rosaline> Ah man, come on. My home town isn't that bad guys! COME ON

[0:28:35] <+sillyschlub> indeed
[0:28:36] <%BinaryFireball> kangaroos are horrifying
[0:28:37] <%a_goth_pancake> australian genital spiders are the worst.
[0:28:38] <BigNerdSam> Toilet Snakes are a new form of terror.
[0:28:42] <%JoshManVGH> the fact that they have forever pain bushes should deter all outdoor activities
[0:28:42] <%Bailey__gaming> Geif Big Snore
[0:28:42] <+chosenjuan42> Australia banned a Peppa pig episode for saying spiders were friends
[0:28:45] <$TIME_PUNCHER> kangaroo tastes like venison, so that's accurate
[0:28:47] <+kumaprime> kangaroos will drown you
[0:28:47] <TechGamer> If something like bugs comes inside the house, they forfeit there life rights imo.
[0:28:47] <%bigboyeggo> DROPBEARS monkaS
[0:28:49] <%vexion_smh> PogChamp OMG
[0:28:51] <yourliteraldog> There is a banned episode of peppa pig in Australia, that told kids not to fear spiders.
[0:28:51] <Weeabooninja> The drop bears are the worst
[0:28:52] <%twistedj3ster> was there one with a red jacket?
[0:28:54] <%roscoe_rosaline> I don't know what everyone is talking about man. It IS FINE HERE.
[0:28:56] <+Wiley_boi> they might give you syphilis
[0:28:57] <+oktavia_von> Australia is new game plus
[0:29:03] <TheCunchPuncher> Kangaroos are considered a nuisance in Australia
[0:29:09] <yourliteraldog> No pat
[0:29:09] <%patriotrenegade> Kangaroos trying to break through your sliding glass door
[0:29:09] <+TheCaptainX96> Prison Island
[0:29:12] <%Sausious> that's like, exactly why
[0:29:12] <dizimous> Someday I want to kill a Kangaroo in 1-on-1 combat
[0:29:13] <+EasyAsDan> Theres a reason the UK used to send all their criminals there centuries ago
[0:29:14] <%Puhff> Koalas have psaBig STDs
[0:29:14] <%BoxNavy> OH GOD
[0:29:14] <%roscoe_rosaline> We eat them.
[0:29:20] <+BIumen> no land apex predators, evolution got to have Fun
[0:29:21] <%cowardman93> Australia needs to be stopped
[0:29:23] <%brickwall35> it's a highly fertile environment that simultaneously is not well suited for humans
[0:29:26] <+Shady_Zaku> Never forget the great Emu War
[0:29:27] <AnneSQF> you're saying it their fault?
[0:29:29] <Shardlab> The natives knew better
[0:29:30] <%OffbeatMinority> this ain't a scene. it's a goddamn venomous arms race!
[0:29:31] <%whyskeywolfe> But where did the dropbears drop from?
[0:29:32] <spongeofmystery> Winters aren't cold enough to kill off bugs is why
[0:29:33] <frostyjay3> I kinda zoned out and came back in during the middle of the spider story and when Peach mentioned that it was Australia it all made sense.
[0:29:35] <+takutoots> @roscoe_rosaline LUL
[0:29:35] <%JoshManVGH> but then they also had islands of super friendly penguines!
[0:29:36] <%roscoe_rosaline> Kangaroos are our national animal and also food!
[0:29:37] <+Deekman> it sucks don't go
[0:29:37] <Weeabooninja> Europe put all the scary animals there for a time-out as a joke
[0:29:39] <%caramelatte1> hell no
[0:29:41] <%AncelDeLambert> venom is common in deserts, and most of Aussie is one
[0:29:41] <%patriotrenegade> Kangaroo meat is a well-deserved come-uppance
[0:29:41] <%Jeemukun> the aboriginals actually killed a lot of the deadlier animals that were there
[0:29:41] <Shardlab> And stayed out of the way of the arms race
[0:29:42] <%super_ej8> good idea Pat
[0:29:42] <Coystick> come Pat, say g'day
[0:29:43] <$dalmek> the air would be toxic to Pat

[1:05:34] <kingmemelord97> noble no

[1:05:39] <%ThisIsLloyd> its exactly like paper mario encounters
[1:05:45] <+chosenjuan42> GO WEAST
[1:05:50] <ShineTheDiamond> Hollow Knight is already cute
[1:05:51] <$insaneintentionsyo> you can tattle too
[1:05:52] <%Bt_Robot> If it's Paper Mario, the enemies will be on the map
[1:06:02] <%vexion_smh> oh hey totally not a goomba LUL
[1:06:06] <%ClericOfSparda> wow
[1:06:09] <%BoxNavy> wow that is exactly the same as that other game

[1:06:10] <%Bt_Robot> and you can attack for a surprise round
[1:06:21] <%donkymagooterson> smack it with the hammer BOP

[1:06:29] <%ClericOfSparda> I want it
[1:06:30] <Goodvibes99508> what is this nondescript paper game?
[1:06:34] <biomegabear> @ClericOfSparda GOOD

[1:06:45] <ergulor> cut the grass
[1:06:56] <$insaneintentionsyo> tattle insane120Ree
[1:06:59] <frostyjay3> I'm looking at this and thinking, "this is just Paper Mario, but the good ones" and honestly I wouldn't want it any other way.
[1:07:06] <Retrogamingfreak> This looks like Paper Mario
[1:07:11] <%Dwarven_Gaming> omg this si SO BLATANT
[1:07:11] <%ThisIsLloyd> tattle on that lil brate
[1:07:18] <%AncelDeLambert> x button I think to switch turns?
[1:07:24] <+ShutUpAceyP> you should spy on all enemies for a card minigame
[1:07:25] <$insaneintentionsyo> yes, chat this game is an homage to paper mario
[1:07:27] <ergulor> Oh it shows the deffense now
[1:07:37] <%ThisIsLloyd> its not exactly a secret paper mario successor lol
[1:07:52] <aeonicvector> Hard mode
[1:07:55] <+ShutUpAceyP> hard mode badge
[1:07:56] <Explodincatz> last patch u didnt see defense
[1:07:57] <Skeletonmanners> hard mode doesnt mess around
[1:07:57] <Shadope342> there's even timed/perfect blocks
[1:07:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> That bug's neck has to be STRONG to constantly attack like that
[1:08:02] <ergulor> it didn't, you just falll
[1:08:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> muh buggy
[1:08:15] <%BoxNavy> nice sound design
[1:08:15] <%Aeogard> wow i cant believe this is an Origami King sequel :)
[1:08:16] <Explodincatz> hardmode badge is a waste of time on standard enemies
[1:08:22] <Tisaric> it's almost like Nintendo stopped making the paper mario games people wanted so an indie company did it
[1:08:25] <+supershadow2022> Enemies hit HARD on hard mode. I honestly just left it off for basic encounters and turned it on for bosses
[1:08:34] <Lunatyr64> hardmode sucks for normal enemies
[1:08:36] <+Shady_Zaku> Surprise first strike!
[1:08:36] <aeonicvector> @Explodincatz Your legally right, but its fun for the challenge
[1:08:39] <%BoxNavy> haha :)
[1:08:42] <+aogman> @patstaresat cut that grass
[1:08:48] <ergulor> ypu get more xp tho
[1:08:54] <jerobees> Hell yeah bugs
[1:09:04] <%BoxNavy> :(
[1:09:08] <$insaneintentionsyo> HARD
[1:09:09] <CursedNobleman> PM64 is gas!
[1:09:14] <aeonicvector> yeah, hardmode means more damage in, but mroe exp
[1:09:15] <Explodincatz> the xp isnt worth it for the ammount of time u have to run back to heal
[1:09:25] <$insaneintentionsyo> with Kabbu, yees
[1:09:26] <aeonicvector> the tall patches
[1:09:26] <$spardanwarrior> The tall grass on the right
[1:09:31] <+ShutUpAceyP> @patstaresat whoever is front will do more damage but more likely to be attack
[1:09:32] <%Bt_Robot> tall grass
[1:09:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> tongue click noise is my jam
[1:09:46] <+Houndemise> Is this like paper mario but with bugs?

[1:10:36] <$insaneintentionsyo> you have TP
[1:10:45] <%BoxNavy> chat is this paper mario :)
[1:10:45] <%Ipsenscastle> that water flowing uphill is driving me crazy
[1:10:45] <%AncelDeLambert> that's okay, the block timing SUCKS
[1:10:48] <%bevyrage> Pat put tank in front!
[1:10:54] <%Bt_Robot> hard badge might mean only perfect blocks work..
[1:10:54] <Jnkolm> Pat
[1:11:04] <%AncelDeLambert> legit blocking isnt worth the effort
[1:11:04] <Jnkolm> Pat's a bog boy I'm sure he'll figure it out
[1:11:12] <+ShutUpAceyP> pat is gonna have to use items... there aren't any healing abilities?
[1:11:33] <jerobees> There are healing skills, but you unlock them later
[1:11:34] <$Cozy90> my rest space huh?
[1:11:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> Rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck tho
[1:11:40] <%YakumoYomi> There are healing abilities, but items are more efficient for healing
[1:11:45] <ShineTheDiamond> Pat is 100% a bog boy
[1:11:48] <%AncelDeLambert> there's one healing ability, but it isnt really worth the tp cost
[1:11:49] <+cvp5127> PAY ME
[1:11:50] <$insaneintentionsyo> Pat is Vi
[1:11:51] <+ShutUpAceyP> Vi is Queen Bee of Pay Me
[1:11:54] <%BoxNavy> bewwies
[1:12:01] <+Shady_Zaku> "and you didn't do anything" lol
[1:12:03] <mayor_manders> lol "it's really not"
[1:12:06] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat IS Vi!
[1:12:08] <UncleOliver> vi is kind of a beetch
[1:12:08] <biomegabear> V? Is that canon wiht cyberpunk?
[1:12:17] <%DappercatEsquire> #sponsored
[1:12:17] <%SirGO0SE> good ad read Clap
[1:12:27] <%Aeogard> These bugs fresh?
[1:12:28] <%Bt_Robot> Vi, the Pockets of the party!
[1:12:30] <ShineTheDiamond> Where are they keeping the currancy if it's the size of their heads?
[1:12:41] <%YakumoYomi> I've never seen Pat throw a boomerang, though
[1:12:59] <%SirGO0SE> @Aeogard from Bugcifica?
[1:13:00] <%Jekado> the bee makes it easier to first strike
[1:13:07] <%Jekado> since you can throw the boomer
[1:13:10] <+Shady_Zaku> OOF
[1:13:14] <+Shady_Zaku> vargBruh vargLUL
[1:13:15] <$insaneintentionsyo> yeah, timing is tough
[1:13:17] <+Grayhammatter> oof
[1:13:25] <%spitelite> hard mode
[1:13:30] <%Aeogard> @SirGO0SE Those bugs from the field no good, make you sick.
[1:13:30] <%craigb31> but in the end
[1:13:31] <%YakumoYomi> Is the timing different for hard mode?
[1:13:34] <+peanutprophet> maybe turn off hard mode till you get the block down
[1:13:35] <Explodincatz> the REAL Royal Guard mechanic
[1:13:35] <DraxTD> hardmode may make blocking HARD, Pat
[1:13:37] <%bevyrage> have bee eat leaf
[1:13:37] <%RetributionP> how could pat be sooooo bad at videogames!?
[1:13:38] <%Jekado> yeah its a bit finky the dodge
[1:13:38] <+ShutUpAceyP> take the hard mode badge off
[1:13:40] <%BoxNavy> pat is going to die in the baby bee game EleGiggle
[1:13:41] <Jnkolm> Cronchy feenFat
[1:13:41] <krin_x> @PatStaresAt vi has a heal ability
[1:13:41] <%AncelDeLambert> @patstaresat the timing is insanely precise
[1:13:46] <aeonicvector> your also on hard, so your taking more damage, feel free to turn it off, and only turn on for bosses (but it DOES boost exp gains)
[1:13:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Oh right you do have hard mode on...
[1:13:54] <marvel877> So, has mindgoblins set in yet?
[1:14:04] <LorcaNomad> FOR REAL!?
[1:14:07] <+lucaflowe> Yeah might wanna take hard mode off
[1:14:10] <s1rcuit> Hi everyone, how's it going?
[1:14:10] <kingmemelord97> how isnt a den just a small cave ?
[1:14:14] <%AncelDeLambert> the problem is that xp gain is worthless
[1:14:15] <+ShutUpAceyP> saving doesnt heal any more does it?
[1:14:19] <s1rcuit> How's he liking it?
[1:14:29] <LorcaNomad> hard mode is actually the intended way to play I heard
[1:14:31] <jerobees> Saving heals at certain points in the game
[1:14:32] <$insaneintentionsyo> goblins
[1:14:34] <Jnkolm> @ShutUpAceyP Yellow crystals do
[1:14:36] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate the xp system in this game so damn much

[1:17:57] <LorcaNomad> spy for hp values pat

[1:18:33] <%AncelDeLambert> the problem this opening segment has is that it DROWNS you in healing utems, yet has save points everywhere. it really screws your perception of health management
[1:18:40] <+Shady_Zaku> "this again"

[1:34:43] <+ShutUpAceyP> GLOBAL WARMING?
[1:34:46] <komixsanz> o fuck its last of us all over again...
[1:34:47] <butthurtdave> remember, miyamoto hates paper mario
[1:34:58] <Warbot40> Did they add some UI elements to this? The defense stat graphic is new.
[1:35:10] <+ShutUpAceyP> music kinda has tones from capcom zelda games
[1:35:11] <%BoxNavy> miyamoto hates everything
[1:35:13] <+blaze__drag> There was a relatively recent update
[1:35:16] <Macfine> Pat likes gross bugs
[1:35:20] <Louie_Salmon> @warbot40 There's been a few QoL updates since it came out
[1:35:27] <+ShutUpAceyP> hard badge make game hard
[1:35:30] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> what if the game ends with a snail infecting your friends with snail parasites so you have to kill your friends and then kick the snail off on a lil raft. he floats off and shouts how YOU belong on this raft, not me
[1:35:30] <+blaze__drag> they added that Defense stat, and also added a few post-game bosses
[1:35:30] <+supershadow2022> Yeah there was a good bit of stuff added in a patch a few months ago
[1:35:32] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> ha ha
[1:35:32] <+Deekman> heal
[1:35:40] <%YakumoYomi> Vi has a healing skill, I think\
[1:35:44] <%chiazam> HEAL
[1:35:45] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:35:47] <tiaramaki> Heal in menu, if you need it
[1:35:50] <Warbot40> I know they added some bosses. Didn't know about the QoL.
[1:35:56] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL Pat dum
[1:35:58] <Warbot40> I still gotta do most of the post game
[1:36:02] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> honey has incredibly medicinal properties, it would make sense that vi can heal
[1:36:11] <+ShutUpAceyP> you can press B to switch your party members in the middle of a fight
[1:36:16] <lessthanhuman_tv> I like everything except the battle UI LUL looks hank
[1:36:21] <lessthanhuman_tv> Jank
[1:36:21] <AoiRob> parry this you filthy casual
[1:36:23] <DraxTD> does... does pat not know he can select the other enemy?
[1:36:30] <PeteyMcPickle> I need this game so bad. I can't believe I never knew it existed
[1:36:30] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> one time this archeaologist found some like 600 year old honey in a tomb and just wiped the dust away and ate a spoonful of the honey
[1:36:31] <$sylphyyyy> nintendo is probably going to be extra crispy cookie cutter until the old execs all retire unfortunately.
[1:36:31] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> still good
[1:36:33] <%AncelDeLambert> except Vi literally just pulls out snacks she hides
[1:36:35] <SharkMissile> This game is cute, but how did they not get sued?
[1:36:36] <PeteyMcPickle> I've wanted something like this for so long
[1:36:40] <Lunatyr64> B switches positions during combat, X switches current attacking member
[1:36:42] <AncelDeLambert> Vi boggarts goodies
[1:36:47] <+supershadow2022> @tabletopsandpowerbottoms Except she doesn't use honey most of the time lmao
[1:36:49] <Warbot40> The visuals are a bit amatuer but this is a top tier RPG for sure.
[1:36:50] <biomegabear> and now its here petey
[1:36:56] <+ShutUpAceyP> you cant select the other enemy with kabu
[1:37:00] <PeteyMcPickle> I'm so happy
[1:37:05] <+ShutUpAceyP> its whoever is in front
[1:37:08] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> well yeah, she needs pollen to make the honey
[1:37:08] <+lethallylactic> LUL
[1:37:10] <+tabletopsandpowerbottoms> i dont see no flowers
[1:37:10] <%BoxNavy> wii
[1:37:20] <AoiRob> @SharkMissile over what? 's not like the game's design is copyrighted
[1:37:22] <PeteyMcPickle> How many other people never heard of this till today?
[1:37:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> "Fine, we'll make our own Paper Mario"
[1:37:30] <$insaneintentionsyo> got e
[1:37:31] <%BoxNavy> oh shit
[1:37:38] <$spardanwarrior> Sick juggle
[1:37:45] <+ShutUpAceyP> it's a good indie paper bugio
[1:37:45] <$milhousego> I've heard this game is sorta like paper mario. Can anyone confirm?
[1:37:53] <AoiRob> smokin sexy style
[1:37:53] <Warbot40> If you guys like what you're seeing, I HIGHLY reccomend checking this out. This is arguably better than classic Paper Mario at least in terms of gameplay.
[1:37:54] <+holo_192> some DMC2 kind of juggling there
[1:37:58] <%vexion_smh> it is
[1:38:02] <LunarRemix> You haven't seen nothing Pat, it goes places.
[1:38:07] <Lodestarrobot> it's like paper mario yes
[1:38:07] <%Sausious> @milhousego look at it
[1:38:09] <tanarath> @patstaresat ONE OR MORE
[1:38:09] <lessthanhuman_tv> I went through a phase last summer where I was deep into paper Mario streams so yeah i heard a lot about this game
[1:38:13] <s1rcuit> @SilvaChariot0133 "With Black Widows, and Hook worms!"
[1:38:15] <%Ranryu692> @SharkMissile how did South Park not get sued? Nintendo doesn't own a game genre
[1:38:15] <saraizarai> Is the writting as good as paper mario?
[1:38:19] <Lunatyr64> this game is a straight upgrade from TTYD tbh
[1:38:23] <+Deekman> I enjoy the irony that this game is "fuck it we'll make our own paper mario" and it rules and the medium is "fuck it we'll make our own silent hill" and it sucks
[1:38:23] <biomegabear> Yes
[1:38:23] <Darthkitten_Prime> I would say it is, to a fault in some places. But overall it's pretty good.
[1:38:25] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:38:27] <AoiRob> this game's better than TTYD IMO
[1:38:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> so when do we get to the jrpg kill the bug god?
[1:38:34] <+holo_192> So how's the writing in this?
[1:38:35] <%Taisuru> Depends on the character
[1:38:37] <YakumoYomi> Vi can
[1:38:38] <$sylphyyyy> @SharkMissile because then Nintendo would have to prove they were going to use a 15 year old system again they haven't since TTYD lol
[1:38:43] <An_Armed_Bear> Kabbu can't
[1:38:43] <+ShutUpAceyP> not with kabbu
[1:38:43] <AoiRob> not with kabbu
[1:38:43] <%Taisuru> Boomerang guy can
[1:38:45] <Louie_Salmon> @saraizarai Nothing incredible, but it's solid
[1:38:48] <ergulor> only with bee kabbu can only attack the front grounded enemy
[1:38:48] <LunarRemix> @saraizarai I'd yes so, yes. It has actual twists and character development
[1:38:49] <+Stormzcales_Lair> vi can
[1:38:54] <Darthkitten_Prime> I think you can attack the other enemy with the boomerang
[1:38:55] <%Ranryu692> Vi has a ranged attack
[1:38:57] <%AncelDeLambert> Vi can hit anything above ground
[1:38:59] <%KineticZen> Bug Tales, uh, woo?
[1:38:59] <+ShutUpAceyP> kabbu is melee and can only attack the front enemy
[1:39:06] <%AncelDeLambert> *she
[1:39:09] <%YakumoYomi> Kabbu can only hit the frontmost enemy (that is on the ground)
[1:39:10] <+lucaflowe> She
[1:39:16] <+lucaflowe> Vi is a girl
[1:39:23] <%BoxNavy> sick
[1:39:24] <$dalmek> oh baby
[1:39:25] <+ShutUpAceyP> you can switch to vi though after knocking it over
[1:39:25] <Warbot40> Writing is solid, not as off the wall as paper mario but its a solid little rpg plot.
[1:39:28] <%vexion_smh> it's literally hammer & jump but two person

[1:41:33] <problemagic> make patcam bigger
[1:41:33] <$sylphyyyy> Leif best boi sylphy1Sass
[1:41:34] <+lethallylactic> @chiazam Hard Mode has special rewards.

[1:42:41] <%ThisIsLloyd> sUUPERRR
[1:42:41] <Warbot40> The combat in this game is better than TTYD. Also it actually gets hard even without hard mode on.

[1:42:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> hit the baby
[1:42:46] <KindaBluesy> Pat did you seen Total War: Warhammer 3 trailer?

[1:43:13] <%BoxNavy> turn relay is a really cool mechanic
[1:43:13] <ergulor> oh yeah, all three of them have dialogs for spy (you can see the others in the meni)
[1:43:16] <+supershadow2022> @louie_salmon Nah, Amber's got a limit. I think it's 30?
[1:43:25] <Warbot40> Leif is the shit
[1:43:25] <Louie_Salmon> Getting used to his attack was hard for me, gotta react

[1:47:13] <%BoxNavy> cool
[1:47:19] <problemagic> fun bug fact: you can actually talk to bugs in real life. just talk to them. they can't talk back but don't let that stop you!
[1:47:21] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @bagoflotions same
[1:47:29] <KindaBluesy> Do you want bugs in your Paper Mario?? Because that's how you get bugs in your Paper Mario!
[1:47:29] <MysticSushiTV> @Louie_Salmon I didn't even know this existed. I'm probably buying this tonight.
[1:47:52] <%chiazam> HEAL
[1:47:52] <%BoxNavy> freezing that water droplet just made me think of golden sun for some reason
[1:47:55] <Warbot40> Worst aspect of the game. Platforming and puzzzle solving ain't great.
[1:47:56] <Lodestarrobot> this game is really good and the bug designs are really cute
[1:48:03] <+Shady_Zaku> vargBruh vargLUL
[1:48:16] <TopTierHarley> Oh it's this kind of game huh
[1:48:17] <An_Armed_Bear> Yeah some of the block puzzles can get a bit tedious
[1:48:19] <$insaneintentionsyo> try icefall out
[1:48:22] <LunarRemix> They're okay, they're on paper mario level
[1:48:28] <%pectusumbra> ummm, audio just gone?
[1:48:28] <%chiazam> Try Leif's Special Attack
[1:48:31] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah puzzles are kinda whatever
[1:48:37] <+zsDirtyHarry> Is this basically paper mario with bugs?
[1:48:45] <TopTierHarley> yes
[1:48:51] <Louie_Salmon> @pectusumbra That's on your end, stream is fine
[1:48:52] <LunarRemix> Basically.
[1:48:57] <Macfine> @zsDirtyHarry its exactly that
[1:48:57] <%pectusumbra> Yeah I refreshed and there's just no audio at all now halp
[1:48:58] <%Ipsenscastle> hot shitted shittedy-damn
[1:48:58] <An_Armed_Bear> Icefall carried me through so much of the game lol
[1:49:04] <biomegabear> yeah but good paper mario
[1:49:15] <%pectusumbra> ooooo, I see
[1:49:25] <TopTierHarley> Is this on any other platform?
[1:49:26] <+threamstream> there's some cheesy strats with keeping Vi poisoned and equipping a bunch of badges like that
[1:49:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> getting close to boss
[1:49:30] <%pectusumbra> somehow the tab was muted despite the stream itself not being muted?
[1:49:33] <An_Armed_Bear> Arguably better than TTYD
[1:49:35] <TopTierHarley> Cause I'll buy this righ tnow
[1:49:38] <butthurtdave> Is this just a one-off/play on your own time?
[1:49:46] <+ShutUpAceyP> vi isn't really the healer
[1:49:49] <russiboy> how many medals can a character carry?
[1:49:51] <%jerobees> @PatStaresAt Vi is a girl, by the way
[1:49:54] <+threamstream> @TopTierHarley switch at least
[1:49:56] <%BoxNavy> good one
[1:50:09] <%AncelDeLambert> there basically is no "healer"
[1:50:10] <%senorpapel> senorpapel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 21 months, currently on a 21 month streak! Holy shit i caught the pat stream, glad to see you playing bug fables. I kinda spite bought the game after paper mario the origami king and I loved it. Hope you enjoy it.
[1:50:11] <gamezerox> She's the ranged dps healer
[1:50:13] <+ShutUpAceyP> vi has one heal ability and it is not worth it
[1:50:19] <Louie_Salmon> @pectusumbra That's a feature chrome has, if you maybe accidentally clicked that
[1:50:19] <Lodestarrobot> you can equip as many medals as you have medal points
[1:50:25] <+chiazam> @An_Armed_Bear Them's fighitng words
[1:50:25] <TopTierHarley> @threamstream damn was hoping for PS4
[1:50:28] <TopTierHarley> oh well
[1:50:32] <Jnkolm> someone said it's on sale on PSN right now @TopTierHarley
[1:50:43] <+threamstream> @TopTierHarley might be, I just don't know
[1:50:50] <TopTierHarley> PogChamp
[1:50:58] <Louie_Salmon> And it ups damage on them
[1:51:03] <%pectusumbra> @Louie_Salmon using firefox
[1:51:06] <An_Armed_Bear> Hitting frozen enemies breaks the ice and does extra damage
[1:51:08] <Louie_Salmon> In exchange for breaking the ice early
[1:51:08] <%pectusumbra> but fixed regardless
[1:51:14] <+ShutUpAceyP> plants hate ice damage
[1:51:45] <+supershadow2022> @russiboy There's not a limit to how many medals a single party member can equip. not a good idea to stack everything on one though
[1:52:07] <%vexion_smh> oh shit it doesn't
[1:52:21] <%BoxNavy> oh no monkaS
[1:52:22] <%StebTheVee> StebTheVee subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! hi
[1:52:23] <$insaneintentionsyo> medal is fine
[1:52:25] <Louie_Salmon> Gotta get that BP

[1:52:27] <+ShutUpAceyP> ranku rup
[1:52:29] <%vexion_smh> yeyeyeyeyeye

[1:52:34] <%a_goth_pancake> this dungeon seems kinda long.

[1:52:40] <+ShutUpAceyP> limited inventory
[1:52:41] <%cvp5127> LUL
[1:52:45] <%Sausious> just like paper mario
[1:52:45] <%BoxNavy> that how they work in pap mar too
[1:52:46] <Arek_1> psaGoblin
[1:52:50] <+supershadow2022> General consensus on Level Ups is to ignore HP forever and get a lot of BP and a little TP
[1:52:52] <+Fooguwu> goblins activated
[1:52:54] <KindaBluesy> What kind of bug would Pat be in real life?
[1:52:57] <%greasypete00> did you not play pap mar
[1:53:00] <DraxTD> so pat never ever played paper mario I guess
[1:53:04] <@SoFarFetched> I can hear his mind goblin yelling at him to pick it up
[1:53:07] <biomegabear> oh its designed by "USE YOUR ITEMS BITCH" with the knowledge that people horde them. Thats good
[1:53:10] <RaidenRising> goblin time
[1:53:27] <Louie_Salmon> Come to think of it, I've never heard Pat talk about a paper mario game
[1:53:36] <$insaneintentionsyo> it's fine
[1:53:46] <+ShutUpAceyP> don't freeze the geyser
[1:53:58] <+ShutUpAceyP> nevermi d lol
[1:54:10] <DraxTD> ice floats in water
[1:54:14] <s1rcuit> basically sleep status effect in good rps
[1:54:23] <$insaneintentionsyo> icefall can hit multiple targets fyi
[1:54:28] <%BettyMwwaahh> oh its actually bug fables. i thought he was making a joke about Bug Snacks
[1:54:31] <%chiazam> why

[1:57:59] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah Pat that's paper mario
[1:58:04] <+ShutUpAceyP> makes it important to spy
[1:58:15] <jdanov> @PatStaresAt maybe it's a bit early still, but how are you liking this so far?
[1:58:16] <iosephe> lol

[2:00:05] <%jerobees> It's on switch, and pc
[2:00:10] <Lunatyr64> PC @biomegabear

[2:00:48] <Profmcstevie> Nice "not blooper" enemy
[2:00:56] <%Taisuru> How do you know?
[2:01:00] <%BettyMwwaahh> dont they tho?
[2:01:01] <Macfine> Bees don't have boomerangs
[2:01:01] <alcett> bee dont have boomerangs
[2:01:01] <%Mrbaconator> sure they do
[2:01:02] <+goosefoiegras> this one does :)
[2:01:02] <%craigb31> that you know of
[2:01:03] <Percivol> they don't use boomerangs either
[2:01:03] <AdmiralButtloaf> bees dont have boomerangs
[2:01:04] <problemagic> they don't have ice powers in canada?
[2:01:04] <+LikeARyder> Bees dont have boomerangs
[2:01:04] <Lunatyr64> sure they dont Kappa
[2:01:05] <Louie_Salmon> I mean bees don't have boomerangs
[2:01:07] <$spardanwarrior> And bees don't throw tiny boomerangs
[2:01:08] <+Stormzcales_Lair> story
[2:01:08] <%walternatorz> I thought all Canadian bugs had ice abilities?
[2:01:09] <+ShutUpAceyP> Pat have you ever met a moth ril befofe?
[2:01:10] <LorcaNomad> Leif is my absolute favorite character in this game for many reasons
[2:01:10] <%Shacklebox> bees don't have boomerangs
[2:01:11] <%MisterRockett> I do wish the spells were more bug themed, yeah.
[2:01:14] <aeonicvector> Moths dont have ice powers HahaThink
[2:01:16] <$insaneintentionsyo> this game is about 50 hours if you do everything
[2:01:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah ice powers aren't super bugly
[2:01:17] <DraxTD> I hope paige RANDOMLY talks about Paper Mario XD
[2:01:17] <Louie_Salmon> Fair
[2:01:17] <Jnkolm> Moths are too small for their ice powers to be noticeable
[2:01:19] <aiutare47> Have you ever asked one Patrick?
[2:01:20] <%bevyrage> some cultured believed moths to be snow faeries because of the dust that'd come off of their wings when they'd fly around.
[2:01:23] <An_Armed_Bear> Light magic might have made more sense
[2:01:24] <%greasypete00> its how they collect the pollen
[2:01:24] <skyentombment> @PatStaresAt PAT STOP SAYING A PARTY MEMBER IS GOOD, YOU'LL JINX HIM AND HE'LL DISAPPEAR BY THE END OF THE CHAPTER
[2:01:24] <problemagic> pat what do you think mothballs are?
[2:01:24] <%ClericOfSparda> Bee-marangs
[2:01:36] <%cvp5127> goblins defeated
[2:01:36] <problemagic> moth spores
[2:01:36] <An_Armed_Bear> He's basically Big Chill from Ben 10
[2:01:45] <+Rekinsinn> HIP
[2:01:45] <%JoshManVGH> just looked up Moth Ice. it's a pesticide.
[2:01:46] <tanarath> BEEmerang, not boomerang.
[2:01:55] <problemagic> look vi is holding a mothball
[2:01:56] <%Garthunox> Its hip to fuck bees!
[2:02:05] <cumurasame> Pat, do you actually like bugs?
[2:02:06] <AdmiralButtloaf> Does Vi need an australian accent because she uses a beemerang?
[2:02:07] <problemagic> woah now
[2:02:08] <%cvp5127> @An_Armed_Bear god youre right
[2:02:08] <bomfiz> why did I think people hated this game
[2:02:09] <alcett> ice magic is good for overworld puzzles, it's the best interaction element
[2:02:15] <Profmcstevie> Bees are suspected to use boomerangs when not observed because they don't want humans to know they discovered tools
[2:02:15] <Percivol> D:
[2:02:20] <@commanderclaw> Cartoon bugs are cute tho
[2:02:20] <%BoxNavy> true
[2:02:20] <bomfiz> bugs are cute

[2:02:29] <problemagic> bugs will remember this
[2:02:30] <%walternatorz> Pat is a bug.
[2:02:31] <%BettyMwwaahh> thats a bit extreme
[2:02:36] <+ShutUpAceyP> @patstaresat aren't you made of bugs?
[2:02:39] <+goosefoiegras> I only played this on switch, looks so crisp in this res

[2:26:14] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah you can even exchange all your medals without reloading a checkpoint
[2:26:30] <%jerobees> It's so good @Louie_Salmon
[2:26:42] <$sylphyyyy> don't forget leif can ice za warudo sylphy1Sass
[2:26:43] <+geosspone> once Leif learns Ice Coffin, you can stunlock most bosses, same for Vi with her needle skills and certain medals
[2:26:48] <Lodestarrobot> i think the multihit does more damage while they're on the web
[2:26:53] <%the22cstomp> this is cute
[2:27:06] <%SirGO0SE> PunOko
[2:27:09] <%chiazam> Take out the small FRIES
[2:27:11] <problemagic> yes make them angery
[2:27:40] <$insaneintentionsyo> lucky
[2:27:45] <problemagic> targeted harassment
[2:27:45] <+supershadow2022> I beat the spider by getting really lucky with freezes and cheesing him out
[2:27:45] <+lethallylactic> monkaS
[2:27:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Add phase is real monkaS
[2:28:05] <+Shady_Zaku> You chose hard node Pat lol
[2:28:20] <problemagic> he nap
[2:28:24] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:28:27] <Ausk> the game is balanced around being played on hard mode
[2:28:29] <%SirGO0SE> this rules
[2:28:31] <+TheNewZealandStory> what the fuck does monkas mean
[2:28:36] <Louie_Salmon> Oh and he even gets his turn back after reviving
[2:28:45] <%BoxNavy> monkas
[2:28:53] <%AncelDeLambert> I hate managing health in this game, you get so lottle to work with
[2:28:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> This music is great
[2:28:57] <%SirGO0SE> return to monkas
[2:28:58] <Arek_1> monkaS
[2:29:04] <gamezerox> Kabbu now super buffed
[2:29:07] <Lodestarrobot> does taunting even do anything useful for this fight
[2:29:20] <%BoxNavy> monkaS is alot like FishMoley wish is closer to haHAA
[2:29:20] <Lodestarrobot> using the points on attacks seems more practical
[2:29:22] <Louie_Salmon> Tactically staying poisoned for the defense, smart
[2:29:24] <daniphofani> this music slaps SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[2:29:25] <Explodincatz> taunting is generally useless
[2:29:29] <ergulor> no the badge
[2:29:38] <%jerobees> No you have defense up while poisoned fro mthat badge
[2:29:38] <%pectusumbra> you have the badge that makes defense go up when poisoned
[2:29:41] <ergulor> the poison defense up
[2:29:44] <goldenprince603> So THIS is paper mario
[2:29:45] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah I never use taunt much
[2:30:00] <+shry7> pat getting confused by the badges is classic pat
[2:30:05] <Arek_1> @TheNewZealandStory It's an emote from Better Twitch TV. It's used to convey fear.
[2:30:09] <$insaneintentionsyo> you got this
[2:30:10] <$sylphyyyy> might be it here
[2:30:10] <problemagic> eat bug ass
[2:30:13] <%Taisuru> dps rACE
[2:30:14] <Lodestarrobot> it seems like they sorta wanted kabbu as tank but his defense or health aren't particularly high for that
[2:30:14] <Louie_Salmon> Might actually do it on hard mode
[2:30:18] <+geosspone> I use taunt with the Favorite One medal, because it gives Leif and Vi damage buffs
[2:30:26] <%jerobees> Yeah yeah do it
[2:30:28] <%ChungusQuest> The real Paper Mario Souls begins here
[2:30:29] <+ShutUpAceyP> got em
[2:30:31] <Ausk> you're supposed to do it on hard mode lol
[2:30:32] <gamezerox> Yay

[2:30:47] <$Cozy90> was that not hard mode?
[2:30:52] <Lodestarrobot> I don't think i have the favorite one medal so that would make sense
[2:31:14] <problemagic> ope
[2:31:14] <Louie_Salmon> I believe that was with the hard mode badge, unless he took it off when I wasn't looking
[2:31:17] <%Taisuru> F
[2:31:29] <%vexion_smh> ye the bugs died
[2:31:33] <Zeikier> and then they died, but canonically this time
[2:31:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> Then all the cute bugs drowned, thus concludes the bug fable
[2:31:39] <dan_g_v> fuckin lmao
[2:31:40] <%BoxNavy> dead :)

[2:35:27] <+DailyOkami> bee-akana
[2:35:27] <Louie_Salmon> @penmanlupine Okay that's too good of an idea
[2:35:38] <problemagic> it's been 100 DAYS
[2:35:39] <Ausk> I like how it's immediately apparent with Leif that just something is fucked up with him
[2:35:39] <%SilvaChariot0133> 🤔
[2:36:02] <s1rcuit> We're Bug! A Dino-Bug Story
[2:36:02] <%JoshManVGH> Time Crimes!

[2:36:20] <%BoxNavy> fuck you ant
[2:36:22] <Lodestarrobot> go to the mantis
[2:36:23] <GypsyMagi> go inside the adventurers building
[2:36:28] <problemagic> thats a long time in bug years
[2:36:30] <Ausk> when you clear an area the saves stop healing you
[2:36:31] <Lunatyr64> No :)
[2:36:32] <gamezerox> No longer heal
[2:36:32] <%SilvaChariot0133> "You're blue now"
[2:36:32] <%jerobees> You have to use Inns now

[2:36:48] <+ShutUpAceyP> gotta use inns now
[2:36:48] <%BettyMwwaahh> thats like a whole generation in bug years
[2:36:56] <$insaneintentionsyo> talk to the hard mode man
[2:37:00] <Lunatyr64> yellow saves are usually just story saves
[2:37:02] <%JoshManVGH> Oh that must be why ice powers. If bugs don't die in winter than they get ice magic.
[2:37:02] <%DappercatEsquire> showing less than concern is easy
[2:37:02] <s1rcuit> It means side-quests later
[2:37:07] <gamezerox> You're a big bug now, no need for yellow crystal

[3:11:34] <%SirGO0SE> "angry comfort"
[3:11:35] <problemagic> its about chat
[3:11:36] <Profmcstevie> Hate reading
[3:11:38] <s1rcuit> @Lodestarrobot which one?
[3:11:50] <+staseb> biomutant does look like a B game. Might be okay. But never really looked really interesting
[3:12:09] <LorcaNomad> put it in da bank
[3:12:19] <%vexion_smh> LUL
[3:12:20] <%AzureGale> GOTEM

[3:12:25] <%BoxNavy> biomutant looks so bad
[3:12:26] <%vexion_smh> MIND MAIL
[3:12:27] <biomegabear> I didnt even see gameplay of biomutant
[3:12:29] <Louie_Salmon> What is biomutant even?
[3:12:31] <Lodestarrobot> it's game where you're a rat creature that mutates body parts, but no one has talked about it for years
[3:12:31] <Profmcstevie> Very threatening thoughts, oooh~
[3:12:31] <biomegabear> what is it
[3:12:31] <s1rcuit> @staseb depends on how the mutation mechanic works
[3:12:33] <+ACurryDish> LUL
[3:12:35] <%JoshManVGH> got them!
[3:12:35] <%Daxalog> Was anyyone else expecting biomutant to be a comic book thing?
[3:12:40] <%AzureGale> Quick someone clip this
[3:12:43] <+staseb> might be nicely eurojanky
[3:12:44] <Snowydragoon> ah biomutant, as apposed to all those technomutants.
[3:12:45] <biomegabear> I only know its a racoon
[3:12:46] <%Bt_Robot> YAY!

[3:12:59] <tanarath> Pat, you just said it, though.
[3:13:17] <jimmytwofeet> NO YOUR PLACE IS SHADY
[3:13:19] <Vaardvark> you're right it's much more polite to say it in public in front of 700 people
[3:13:19] <$insaneintentionsyo> ohhhh
[3:13:24] <s1rcuit> Bee crimes
[3:13:25] <Torgue_1> But it would be on brand for you
[3:13:36] <+blaze__drag> I really hope Woolie plays this too
[3:13:38] <+Grayhammatter> bee crimes?!
[3:13:40] <+ekodrop> bugs are gross
[3:13:43] <+staseb> This werewolf - the apocalypse game releasing soon looks like fine trash too. Gameplay seems janky and you play an eco-terrorist-werefolf, fighting polluting coprorations. Oh boy!

[3:32:50] <%Monkeyweed21> only bp is the Woolie way

[3:33:47] <+supershadow2022> The thing is you get enough HP plus badges that you can just emulate HP level Ups if you need HP that bad
[3:33:48] <%pokefan9956> I liked hard mode for a while, but I ended up hitting a boss which made the game basically impossible
[3:33:53] <%AzureGale> As Barbatos would put it, "NO! ITEMS! EVERRRRRRRRRRR!"
[3:33:53] <%Bt_Robot> AN archaeologist is married to rocks, a "Rock Husband " in the common tongue

[3:35:43] <%JoshManVGH> sad about it
[3:35:46] <seniormeatbox> does pat know he can swap team positions
[3:35:50] <+Stormzcales_Lair> take hard mode off as well except for mini bosses or bosses, the xp gain is minimal
[3:35:51] <+lucaflowe> Good idea
[3:35:59] <+lucaflowe> He does
[3:36:00] <heartlesshealer> Pat, I recommend taking off Both of the difficulty modifiers until you feel more comfortable
[3:36:15] <zakaraz> but the achievements and badges
[3:36:20] <%vexion_smh> man fuck mosquitos
[3:36:23] <%BoxNavy> mopitter...
[3:36:25] <heartlesshealer> okay then
[3:36:29] <%pokefan9956> hard mode kinda turns the game into a slog I felt
[3:36:31] <+lucaflowe> Pat is probably gonna keep hard mode on cause bigger level up number
[3:36:32] <s1rcuit> "ants are not welcome"
[3:36:32] <+OperatorPlease> hard mode is killer on bosses. hell see
[3:36:34] <%AzureGale> Ants not welcome?
[3:36:44] <Ausk> @PatStaresAt the hard mode mod is actually what the game is balanced around, but some of the areas are a little rough
[3:36:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> GOOD
[3:36:45] <$Cozy90> fire something something
[3:36:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fren Lasahe Ants welce

[3:36:52] <ergulor> hard mode is just a bother the first 2 chapters after that is not that hard
[3:36:52] <bear_breaker20> I hate ants all my homies hate ants
[3:36:52] <+AgentApe0> Omg, this is just bug Paper Mario

[3:37:12] <$StrawberryPantsu> BUG RACE WAR
[3:37:13] <silver__viii> Ants go to Ant Hell
[3:37:25] <%Taisuru> Pat, the mosquitos attack every time you hit one
[3:37:31] <%Taisuru> Freeze them like it said
[3:37:31] <%TheWinged7> they told you to freeze it last battle
[3:37:33] <+goonsnob> pat you better be pressing the context sensitive dialogue button for every new area and npc

[3:38:36] <SnapIntoaTimJim> I figured Pat would be squirmy
[3:38:44] <s1rcuit> @Taisuru I forgot, my bad
[3:38:51] <Jnkolm> The freeze doesn't always freeze, costs TP and still counts as a hit
[3:38:56] <%TheWinged7> freeze & push
[3:38:56] <%Taisuru> Push with kabu
[3:39:02] <$insaneintentionsyo> nope
[3:39:02] <penitentpendant> It looks like you can shove ice blocks with the beetle?
[3:39:11] <heartlesshealer> later

[3:46:25] <+lordericter> Pat is doing a bit huh
[3:46:26] <$FluffiTamamo> So THATS why the game seems harder for him. ironmouseSTARE

[3:46:32] <%AzureGale> Reminds me of that Awkward Zombie comic with Fire Emblem
[3:46:36] <+supershadow2022> If you're serious about hard mode consumables are absolutely necessary
[3:46:37] <Arek_1> psaGoblin
[3:46:40] <tanarath> Pat needs to check the cooking wiki
[3:46:45] <+taltalheights> Elixers are a trick from Big Consumable
[3:46:48] <%Taisuru> But pat, you already know the game gives tons of items
[3:46:50] <Jnkolm> feenNap
[3:46:56] <Slim_Lipid> why is that boomerang trash?
[3:46:58] <Lunatyr64> hard mode with no items is going to be awful the whole time

[3:47:19] <$lotharrio> What if, one day, he needs those elixirs?
[3:47:23] <%JoshManVGH> Pat would have no issues holding the Game Stop line. It's digital item, it might never come back if he sells it.

[3:48:03] <%Monkeyweed21> why play on hard mode if bad at game?

[3:54:05] <+ekodrop> if only pat was good at game
[3:54:18] <lambishly> Paper Mario: 1,000 Bugs on my Floor
[3:54:19] <ergulor> it he wasn't playing on hard that would be ok but...
[3:54:24] <+taltalheights> It'd be funny to tie being able to run vs how many items you had
[3:54:27] <$FluffiTamamo> Wait so what happens when a character dies? He just hauls all the way back to an inn or something?
[3:54:29] <penitentpendant> Hoarding is go

[3:54:39] <SnapIntoaTimJim> What if you need it now, pat?
[3:54:40] <+ekodrop> when you get better items
[3:54:42] <jellssssss20> Because MindGoblins make a baby
[3:54:45] <$lotharrio> Pat was showing off a feature and putting the game on hard mode to test his tactical skills.
[3:54:47] <gamezerox> More like save them for never

[4:01:55] <penitentpendant> By using items

[4:02:07] <Ausk> gotta grind and/or use items
[4:02:07] <%spitelite> buy items
[4:02:09] <Daniel_Is_I> Use items and don't play on hard?
[4:02:10] <zakaraz> Pat is stupid that is why he die
[4:02:10] <%BoxNavy> ITS IMPOSSIBLE
[4:02:11] <tanarath> ITEMS
[4:02:12] <jimmytwofeet> YOU CAN DO IT
[4:02:13] <%pectusumbra> "I'm die thank you forever!"\
[4:02:14] <$Cozy90> @aslfrasle pretty much
[4:02:16] <+goonsnob> if only there was a way to lower the difficulty
[4:02:17] <%Broand> This game must be impossible
[4:02:20] <%MelBrooksKA> Maybe later has come...
[4:02:21] <%SilvaChariot0133> How can this Be!?
[4:02:23] <Profmcstevie> After dying I go back to my save? Nooooo, what kind of video game is this
[4:02:25] <%weissguard> HOW can this BEE?
[4:02:25] <$lotharrio> There's NO. WAY.
[4:02:26] <Ausk> you eventually stop getting reasonable amounts of exp
[4:02:26] <+ekodrop> items are infinite if you keep buying them
[4:02:27] <%xiccy> the BIG death
[4:02:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Why are you playing on hard mode if you're bad at this game?
[4:02:31] <%JoshManVGH> No Item Hard Mode on first run?
[4:02:37] <+Stormzcales_Lair> freeze
[4:02:38] <penitentpendant> Wow, that's some vindictive RNG
[4:02:38] <$Spydurman> poll for whether he calls it or turns off hard mode
[4:02:41] <tiaramaki> YOOOO THIS LITTLE GUY
[4:02:44] <gamezerox> Oh my god he keeps getting golden seedlings
[4:02:53] <Ausk> @Monkeyweed21 it's meant to be played on hard mode but you DO have to use items lol
[4:02:54] <+Gallhint> !! stream at risk !!
[4:02:54] <CappuccinoGuil> Was that EIGHT damage?
[4:02:55] <+Grayhammatter> 8? HOLY
[4:03:00] <+storkeylope> Honestly the way I played it was just turning on hard mode for bosses
[4:03:02] <tiaramaki> Only your first hit counts
[4:03:04] <ergulor> metal slime
[4:03:05] <+OperatorPlease> THOSE ATTACK?!
[4:03:07] <%Taisuru> METAL SLIME
[4:03:10] <%AzureGale> Is that like a metal slime
[4:03:13] <+goonsnob> I've played this game for 40 hours and ive never seen that enemy
[4:03:14] <%JoshManVGH> it's like full ghost no murder for a first run in Dishonored, it seems.
[4:03:15] <%Broand> That was a metal slime
[4:03:17] <ergulor> save
[4:03:24] <%Taisuru> Get your items ya stupid bitch
[4:03:27] <%AzureGale> bt
[4:03:28] <%MassConnect> which one of these bug is going to be Aerith
[4:03:33] <+ConLin_Arts_> dambage
[4:03:34] <%AzureGale> btw you should save
[4:03:37] <%BoxNavy> hmm
[4:03:37] <@StridentSong> That was a Metal Slime, it's not a good example. You just got lucky/unlucky depending on how you look at it
[4:03:40] <+ekodrop> who thunk it
[4:03:42] <+BeeComfy> Is this game supposed to be like Paper Mario TYD?
[4:03:43] <tanarath> pat, save
[4:03:44] <+Stormzcales_Lair> enemies weaker
[4:03:45] <BerryliciousDefinition> No way
[4:03:47] <SnapIntoaTimJim> Pat, it wouldnt be impossible if you had used potions.
[4:03:51] <ergulor> the enemies deal less damage
[4:03:58] <%vexion_smh> hard mode is hard - pat 2021
[4:04:02] <ergulor> and use less complicated tactics
[4:04:03] <%Taisuru> Enemies deal less
[4:04:05] <+OperatorPlease> theres no weevils with hard mode off, pat
[4:04:05] <Skeletonmanners> hard mode makes enemies hit harder and do different things
[4:04:07] <LVL1_Scumbag> Easy mode has been selected
[4:04:10] <+Gallhint> you take more damage?
[4:04:11] <Skeletonmanners> it doesnt make you hit weaker
[4:04:14] <%BoxNavy> there is NO difference
[4:04:18] <%pectusumbra> I think it's enemies are less powerful
[4:04:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> is Pat really this dumb?
[4:04:19] <gamezerox> Hard mode is hard, but not the hardest
[4:04:21] <SnapIntoaTimJim> I know how pat behaves and handles games. I dont know why I wanna tell him otherwise. I wish to experience pat as pat experiences the world.
[4:04:22] <$lotharrio> Obviously the game must be crazy. Not Pat. He's normal.
[4:04:23] <%Taisuru> Enemies deal more pat...
[4:04:25] <tiaramaki> Might be best to save
[4:04:26] <Jnkolm> Enemies are stronger in hard, doesn't change your characters
[4:04:32] <+ekodrop> it's not...
[4:04:34] <@StridentSong> Pat. Enemies deal more incoming damage in Hard Mode.
[4:04:36] <Ausk> it's not the same, your sample size is 1
[4:04:37] <%Monkeyweed21> thats wrong
[4:04:37] <gamezerox> Spy and compare
[4:04:38] <+Shady_Zaku> vargMAMA vargMAMA vargMAMA vargTech vargTech vargTech vargTech
[4:04:39] <@StridentSong> You're output does not change
[4:04:46] <%BoxNavy> @Bane_Kaikyo i mean youve been watching him for a while
[4:04:47] <jumpyhugs> Get hard, stay hard
[4:04:51] <1matheuw> oh shit is bug fables
[4:04:52] <$lotharrio> Enemies with less HP and atk would be the easiest way to adjust.
[4:04:52] <+Gallhint> TAKE MORE DAMAGE
[4:04:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> Bruh
[4:04:58] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Enemie's output changes
[4:04:58] <Skeletonmanners> because you get hit harder??
[4:04:58] <Profmcstevie> Because they hit hard
[4:04:58] <%JoshManVGH> Pat has opted to take 3 damage. hit, instead of 1
[4:04:59] <@StridentSong> ...
[4:05:01] <+Shady_Zaku> YOU TAKE MORE
[4:05:01] <bigtavious> Holy shit pat
[4:05:01] <%Taisuru> BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO HEALING ITEMS YOU MONGOLOID
[4:05:02] <%pectusumbra> because THEIR output goes up
[4:05:02] <%goose_attack_almanac> AAAH
[4:05:02] <+parrotman01> I have a friend that thinks Oragami King is 100% better than this and is a better sequel gameplay wise to Paper Mario. He has also never played Thousand Year Door.
[4:05:03] <%Monkeyweed21> ENEMIES HIT HARDER
[4:05:03] <$lotharrio> Just like XCom.
[4:05:04] <%ThisIsLloyd> bro your reading half teh sentence
[4:05:06] <%shurtal> enemies hit harder, some have higher defense
[4:05:07] <%DappercatEsquire> is he getting us back for fucking with him earlier
[4:05:08] <@StridentSong> Did you literally ignore my comment before htat/
[4:05:09] <penitentpendant> Input changes
[4:05:12] <%vexion_smh> Tbh I'd like to think this all happened in someone's garden LUL
[4:05:13] <@StridentSong> ENEMIES HIT YOU HARDER
[4:05:13] <%BoxNavy> THE ENEMIES HIT HARDER ON HARD MODE OH MY GOD ITS NOT DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
[4:05:13] <Profmcstevie> PAT DRINK WATER, BRAIN AT RISK
[4:05:14] <+Gallhint> Pat sundowning harder than ever before
[4:05:15] <Jnkolm> is Pat doing a bit
[4:05:16] <@SoFarFetched> Pat hard mode is they do "MORE" damage.
[4:05:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Apparently
[4:05:24] <silver__viii> i'm all for chaotic pat
[4:05:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> PAT ENEMIES DO MORE DAMAGE DUMMY
[4:05:28] <+goonsnob> Her name is vi pat
[4:05:28] <+OperatorPlease> pat you've played DMC, difficulty is more than numbers
[4:05:29] <%Taisuru> GET YOUR DAMN ITEMS
[4:05:32] <penitentpendant> Hydrate and gain Brain Points!
[4:05:32] <%Monkeyweed21> IF ONLY YOU HAD HEALING ITEMS
[4:05:36] <LVL1_Scumbag> If only there were a way
[4:05:37] <+ekodrop> you wouldn't be wasting so much time if you used items
[4:05:46] <%Mr_Pylon> Looks like you need the items
[4:05:49] <+LordGeneric> Gotta find some king of carry-able undamage consumable
[4:05:53] <%JoshManVGH> It's impossible!
[4:05:59] <@SoFarFetched> "easy mode is now selectable"
[4:06:01] <Explodincatz> why even fight at all just run from every fight
[4:06:01] <%BoxNavy> really sucks that there are no healing items in this video game rpg
[4:06:12] <silver__viii> damn these enemies hit kind of 'hard' don't they Kappa
[4:06:13] <+aslfrasle> Don't you mean fuck...bee
[4:06:16] <+Gallhint> They should have put items in this game to make fights easier
[4:06:17] <+aslfrasle> ?
[4:06:18] <Lunatyr64> if only there existed some sort of consumable healing kits
[4:06:41] <penitentpendant> Fight those goblins Pat! Take control!
[4:06:43] <GreyHeartedHero> Pat's mind goblins will impede all progres
[4:06:52] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[4:06:54] <+blaze__drag> if only you could combine them into more powerful healing kits
[4:06:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> NotLikeThis
[4:06:57] <+LordGeneric> The point is to use them up
[4:07:00] <$sylphyyyy> but you'll get more lmfao
[4:07:02] <+ekodrop> time to switch games, it's ok
[4:07:06] <%Taisuru> Then turn off hard mode so you take less damage
[4:07:06] <%goose_attack_almanac> I pay this man for more of this
[4:07:09] <+Grayhammatter> the point is to use them
[4:07:11] <%jerobees> You can cook them to make them better so you use them less often
[4:07:11] <+OperatorPlease> youre walking back to town BECAUSW you dont have them
[4:07:17] <$insaneintentionsyo> now items?
[4:07:17] <+ultimafullmetal> Do cooking
[4:07:24] <+Stormzcales_Lair> cook honey drop
[4:07:24] <$FluffiTamamo> Are you rationalizing not buying simple-ass potions? SilverSuffer
[4:07:33] <ergulor> cook them so they're better
[4:07:35] <%DappercatEsquire> but you can't bring the inn with you
[4:07:35] <penitentpendant> But you can't bring The Inn with you
[4:07:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Money is easy to get
[4:07:35] <+ekodrop> they cost more in terms of time
[4:07:36] <gamezerox> Not really
[4:07:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> but they let you go farther before needing the inn NotLikeThis
[4:07:39] <%spitelite> cook them
[4:07:40] <$lotharrio> But you can't carry the inn with you, right?
[4:07:40] <$sylphyyyy> Pat I swear, you will get more items because you will get a berry bank LUL
[4:07:43] <+Grayhammatter> then... why don't you cook them?
[4:07:44] <%goose_attack_almanac> and the enemies respawn don't they
[4:07:44] <tiaramaki> Items you can get from cooking can do good
[4:07:48] <Louie_Salmon> But you're actually spending the most limited currency of all, which is time
[4:07:52] <$insaneintentionsyo> cooking is good..
[4:07:53] <ShichiNoBushi> The difference is for convenience.

[4:20:31] <%jerobees> No it's good tho
[4:20:32] <%Monkeyweed21> you need to follow the recipe @PatStaresAt
[4:20:35] <$lotharrio> Roughly doubles the effectiveness if you just cook the basic ones, yeah.
[4:20:36] <Jontman42> is this the Hollow Knight sequel
[4:20:37] <LVL1_Scumbag> You gained recipes tho
[4:20:37] <penitentpendant> Really needs a recipe list on that screen
[4:20:38] <%goose_attack_almanac> Just do it right the first time without knowing what happens
[4:20:38] <Louie_Salmon> You make the sickest items with cooking tho
[4:20:40] <ergulor> is really good
[4:20:43] <Explodincatz> check the cooking wiki
[4:20:44] <heartlesshealer> You'll need that mechanic late game
[4:20:44] <$Cozy90> in ur butt

[4:20:51] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt online
[4:20:51] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Npcs give you hints
[4:20:51] <%xiccy> buy more
[4:20:53] <%jerobees> It's in your menu
[4:20:53] <Jnkolm> you're making the recipe book
[4:20:58] <SinisterBroccoli> wait so is this just paper mario?
[4:21:04] <+Gallhint> you shouldnt have to check a fucking wiki
[4:21:05] <%Taisuru> Gotta experiment
[4:21:06] <$sylphyyyy> yes
[4:21:07] <%theoriginalbigboy3535> That mechanic gives you the best times @PatStaresAt ...but new recipes are just online
[4:21:09] <$sylphyyyy> but bugs
[4:21:09] <%AzureGale> Trial and error, baby!
[4:21:11] <penitentpendant> You can also save scum
[4:21:12] <%super_ej8> LUL
[4:21:12] <$floralkami> this is Woolie assuming cooking was a gamble, but 10x worst
[4:21:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> Trial and Error baby
[4:21:14] <%goose_attack_almanac> Yeah pat it's a game
[4:21:15] <+Fooguwu> experimentation is important for cooking patrick
[4:21:16] <+shry7> now you know for next time
[4:21:16] <+ekodrop> by not being dumb
[4:21:17] <Explodincatz> yes it IS a shit system
[4:21:17] <+Gallhint> save and reload
[4:21:19] <$floralkami> *worse
[4:21:19] <$Mekhet09> Do what you always do pat.
[4:21:20] <%super_ej8> it's there tho Kappa
[4:21:20] <LVL1_Scumbag> God forbid you might have to try
[4:21:20] <%AzureGale> That's how they did it in Paper Mario
[4:21:21] <%goose_attack_almanac> by doing
[4:21:22] <+Stormzcales_Lair> i saaved scummed,
[4:21:24] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> Npcs will give you hints
[4:21:25] <ergulor> trial and error and some lore and misions
[4:21:26] <Louie_Salmon> Whatever just cheat
[4:21:28] <%spitelite> just do it
[4:21:31] <%the22cstomp> what are they gonna do? ban you?
[4:21:35] <$Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt do what you always do just cheat
[4:21:36] <%Taisuru> @Explodincatz Not if you're not stupid, it's also totally optional
[4:21:38] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Do you want for real wiki spoilers or no?
[4:21:38] <penitentpendant> Save Scum before cooking is, unfortunately, optimal
[4:21:39] <%theoriginalbigboy3535> If you're gonna save scum, just look it up
[4:21:40] <%Agami23> maybe theres an item you get later thats a recipe book that will tell you some
[4:21:45] <+blaze__drag> I remember leaf + honey being good early game cause it heals both TP and HP
[4:21:50] <DestroPrime83> Oh my god this is just TTYD
[4:21:54] <Scuzster> you hear windjammers 2 got rollback?
[4:21:58] <%theoriginalbigboy3535> ^
[4:22:01] <dan_g_v> do you get something from instant win fights? Or just skipping them?
[4:22:07] <+GovernmentMY> so this is just paper mario with bugs
[4:22:11] <$floralkami> "I don't think that's intentional" Pat says at a tried and tried tradition of rpg gameplay
[4:22:17] <penitentpendant> Technically, as long as you don't save, you'll get your items back if you die again
[4:22:18] <$floralkami> *true
[4:22:18] <ergulor> he has an insta kill badge for wimpy enemies
[4:22:20] <Profmcstevie> Windjammers plays better than Street Fighter 5 online, beautiful LUL
[4:22:25] <theanora1> is that like a feature that everytime Pat says fuck his screen turns redish?
[4:22:25] <$lotharrio> This is on PS4? ... I think I'm about to purchase.
