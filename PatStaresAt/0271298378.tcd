[0:37:35] <der_dachs13> crazy how the first thing they show REAL game play for is this as apposed to their giant titles
[0:37:36] <BobTheism> Is this copyrighted music?
[0:37:36] <+Bael_Lord_of_End> BibleThump

[0:37:38] <%Agami23> people who actually care about their product and their fans? this isnt EA

[0:37:43] <+Jsutton1254> They've shown more Unravel than Battlefield
[0:37:43] <$mandragoraroot> this is the opposite of EA
[0:37:43] <%CaptainPileDriver> THIS IS TO GENUINE
[0:37:43] <DukeMoose> Order some MacDonaldsTM
[0:37:43] <Idon__> This is like the only heart this EA conference has.
[0:37:44] <bakedcheeseman> Its alright
[0:37:44] <LeoStrahl> So will Pat or Paige get stuck being the blue one?
[0:37:45] <waddle_dee1992> MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, THEY WILL DISCOVER SOMETHING ABOUT THEMSELVES

[0:37:53] <V0idZoid> ea trying to pretend theyre not hatable by putting the kind boy on stage\
[0:37:54] <+manwithboxonhead> Beyond Two Yarns: Become Unraveled

[0:38:00] <@WoolyFish> This looks so sweet.
[0:38:01] <gimmickypizza> this has a soul
[0:38:02] <+thesyndrome> @AngriestPat they are trying to foster good will by forcing a nervous indie man out on stage
[0:38:03] <kvnmck94> the sundance film festival of video games
[0:38:04] <HellboundHeartless> @saintvaliance Fifa ,Battlefield 5, Battlefront 2 updates ,Respawn is doing a Star wars game
[0:38:05] <xXFlyingBrickXx> This looks so wholesome
[0:38:06] <+nepwar> this would be a good game for pat and paige
[0:38:06] <skybriel1> actual video game appears
[0:38:06] <SinnerBeta> @AngriestPat wool confirmed for mainstream then?
[0:38:07] <KruelDestiny> This looks good
[0:38:07] <Wistelligence> i mean, they want the mainstream people to buy indie games too
[0:38:08] <+RainShott> This is better than all the other games they’ve shown combined

[0:38:15] <wired_soul> GivePLZ Squid2 Squid2 TakeNRG
[0:38:16] <17sevens> They needed to include this to fake not being as soulless as they are, so they outsource the soul to the indie devs
[0:38:16] <+SergentSov> Did I just hear the sonic bouncepad?

[1:10:21] <Thesaltymixture> TENNO SCUM
[1:10:21] <Thunderhawk47> combat is probably fucked, that little sneak peak showed the game running at like 15 fps
[1:10:21] <Louie_Salmon> Okay, "Javelin" is a pretty good name for the power-armor
[1:10:22] <+generalve> @AngriestPat They just released a new BFV presentation PAT
[1:10:22] <Hidashi13> look at this monster hunter with machines
[1:10:22] <kathrineai> what are the creatures they keep mentioning
[1:10:22] <%SGrim> Javelin is a better name than this game deserves. rooWut
[1:10:23] <Griffin1171> WHERE ARE THE GUNS?
[1:10:23] <+SoejimaMX> where is ＥＬＭＯ
[1:10:24] <%Finalgear14> so it's almost like these people use something...something like a frame of war or maybe a warframe

[1:10:34] <Polarix64> Wasn't that footage from last year
[1:10:34] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Must be neat NOT being Warframe huh BioWare?
[1:10:34] <+nepwar> cant show the no asset they have
[1:10:34] <IminyourBase> what we tried to do was play destiny
[1:10:34] <KronusX7> SHOW GAMPLA
[1:10:35] <+Luigicow92k> This could be perfectly fine if it turns out to be "Good Destiny"
[1:10:35] <operator_san> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:10:35] <Meekest> @AngriestPat Half of the gameplay footage shown is the stuff they showed last year too
[1:10:35] <+Nomicro4u> Oh Bioware what happen ;(
[1:10:36] <Deimos002> Inb4 it's out after the show Kappa
[1:10:36] <MMetas> Show the game already!
[1:10:37] <+JustToWatch> Actually that sounds cool. Ancient Terraforming Machines vs a planetary hive mind
[1:10:37] <reonome> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper

[1:10:42] <PunishedVenomWolf> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:10:42] <+RainShott> Hey Pat how are you doing in Warframe
[1:10:42] <ikillme7> Instead of the Traveler, we have the Anthem.
[1:10:43] <+213372bu> I love people talking about games even more than actually playing them!
[1:10:43] <DeathByPoke7> the first thing we think about is destiny
[1:10:43] <bakedcheeseman> Is tom cruise in it
[1:10:43] <Ixiah> please dont tell me theres like 10 skills and thats it
[1:10:43] <%R0bobot> well I'll be honest, Anthem at least has better names than Da DArkness and Da Light
[1:10:44] <Polarix64> ResidentSleeper
[1:10:44] <+Dr_DankMemes> YOU ARE AN ACTION GAME WITH NO VIEWABLE ACTION
[1:10:44] <AssassinAI> Gameplay is clearly just dev mode flying around, no enemy populations or effects other than weather are even working
[1:10:44] <M4eta> THEY ARE SHOWING NOTHING!!!!
[1:10:44] <Dingalow> MOVE ON ALREADY
[1:10:45] <shieldecho> In all honesty I wouldn't mind a game where you just run around and fly to get to new areas and just explore shit. But I don't think that's what the game's gonna be.
[1:10:45] <%ssjklyco> Goodbye Bioware
[1:10:45] <Plague_Doctor_D> JUST ONE MISSION PLEASE
[1:10:45] <cant_pick_a_name> kinda looks like zachary quinto

[1:11:01] <DothMyNugsBequeathMe> WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT OpieOP
