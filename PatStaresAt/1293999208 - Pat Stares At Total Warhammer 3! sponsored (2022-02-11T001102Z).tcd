[0:08:53] <+Shonen_hero> that's about the sum of my answer. I like the idea of Warhammer, I like the aesthetic, I like some if not all of the lore, and I hate Gamers Workshop
[0:08:54] <sapphomet777> pats gonna play as fartman faction isnt he
[0:08:54] <kazadaz> There's Evil undead, Good undead, and Pirate undead
[0:08:55] <%cade_calrayn> HI ELMO
[0:08:56] <%SpontaneousC> what if America was space lizard men
[0:08:57] <%cooldude69xx> A setting any more EXTRA would be infeasible

[0:09:13] <+ryderbootz> edgy camp aesthetic
[0:09:14] <sirtommygunn> dawn of war
[0:09:16] <+Shonen_hero> I have Total War Rome or whatever
[0:09:17] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Theres a tool tip for nurgle that has the work Smegma
[0:09:21] <quantras6> Shogun 2 is pretty good
[0:09:23] <mar_krow> I know nothing about war hammer except marines and orks
[0:09:26] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BASED AUTHORITARIANISM- in 40k only in 40k real life no
[0:09:28] <+Shonen_hero> It wasn't very memorable imo
[0:09:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Oui Oui
[0:09:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats what Napoleon is worth tbh
[0:09:31] <%Monkeyweed21> they are VERY DIFFERENT from normal RTS
[0:09:31] <%Brassnarwhal> what if your bullets could tell when they are in people so they can explode at the perfect moment
[0:09:32] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Rome 1 was sick
[0:09:35] <%Fenrirlives> Fenrirlives subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 56 months! Aw yeah! time to Total War! aka, I stare at all the cool character models while not understanding how any of the game systems work! Oh wow, that nightmare beast looks terrifyi- oh wait that's just Pat. Sup Buddy!
[0:09:36] <%cade_calrayn> pet that cat
[0:09:37] <+MoaLaMoa> shogun 2 and medieval 2 TW supremacy
[0:09:38] <+heiro001> DxCat
[0:09:40] <%terrorengine> Napoleon wasn't good
[0:09:43] <+trackles_64> its hard to learn
[0:09:45] <%oda_flobunaga> @ToneBacas no, it looks like a horseshoe crab and instead of a ball/ infrared light its on a joystick mount
[0:09:47] <+Shonen_hero> but there's so much stuff
[0:09:48] <Yomamma1337> total warhammers cool once you get into it
[0:09:50] <%twistedj3ster> I know that feeling
[0:09:50] <kazadaz> Pat you've been making Total War soundtracks since like 2015
[0:09:51] <quantras6> @mar_krow that's 40k the sci fi stuff. this is based on fantasy Warhammer so no marines.
[0:09:53] <sapphomet777> i reccomend the auto resolve for battles!
[0:09:53] <+Laycas49> @mar_krow That is 40k, This is fantasy. Think elves, and dwarves
[0:09:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Units being huge formations actually makes an enormous difference for gameplay
[0:09:57] <FievelFails> The table top game will steal your life away
[0:09:58] <Profmcstevie> Stubbornly getting over the hump for cool stuff
[0:09:59] <+rycon88> Napoleon was okay not great but decent
[0:09:59] <+Shonen_hero> you've reached the event horizon?
[0:10:00] <+SimplyRandy> it's worth it. Favorite rts series

[0:10:10] <%Bluwizard21> da orks
[0:10:11] <+demon1103> I played Rome, but only did auto-resolve...I REALLY want to play the Total Warhammers and actually use the battle system...but dear lord I suck!!!
[0:10:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> still play it
[0:10:12] <tranquilturnip> its nurgle
[0:10:13] <mrtanaka111> nurgle
[0:10:14] <%SpontaneousC> shogun 2 is probably legit where the franchise peaked honestly
[0:10:14] <mar_krow> Oh thanks
[0:10:15] <%blastyoboots> ROKS
[0:10:16] <%barkon345> is this game based off of warhammer fantasy or based on Dune?

[0:10:23] <Quilltaz> total war is fun as long as you dont expect the deepest city builder or the deepest political stuff
[0:10:24] <+queaks> It was easy for me to start with history cause the unit match ups make real world sense. Then the jump to warhammer was a lot easier

[0:10:46] <JackalKing> Skaven arent in WH3 yet guys.
[0:10:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ogres are the pre-order DLC so not surprising
[0:10:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt because ogres are preorder DLC
[0:10:52] <+Shonen_hero> why though
[0:10:54] <+queaks> The embargo lifts have been so arbitrary
[0:11:04] <%valcheese> valcheese subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Yah Warhammer!!
[0:11:04] <%Monkeyweed21> Ogres and reviews are on Valentines day

[0:11:08] <Nikbottom> I’m big excited for Grand Cathay
[0:11:09] <quantras6> 'ATE CATHAY, 'ATE KISLEV, 'ATE CHAOS, SIMPLE AS
[0:11:11] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Cuz Ogres are free for the first week buys
[0:11:14] <Profmcstevie> Lizards be licking trees, lmao
[0:11:16] <+demon1103> really? that's weird..what are the Ogres hiding!!!  oh...preorder DLC...sigh
[0:11:21] <sapphomet777> smh the man named queek wants skaven love you too bud
[0:11:23] <lliam01> cuase adeptus mechanicus seem like a pat faction
[0:11:26] <+Stormzcales_Lair> you mean Herbaviore?
[0:11:26] <huskarl_zap> the embragos were for hidden characters but Boris was exposed anyway
[0:11:32] <+Shonen_hero> won't they eventually sell those Ogres on the side?
[0:11:34] <kazadaz> Their main thing is Eating
[0:11:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> the big content creators get to stream like 4 hours a day until release
[0:11:39] <Quilltaz> Ogres are the big chonks that us gamers can relate to
[0:11:39] <kazadog> no ogres yet Sadge
[0:11:40] <+Shonen_hero> outside of the promotion?
[0:11:45] <+SimplyRandy> Pat, are you still able to show them if they attack you? Or how does that work?
[0:11:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they've done a tiered embargo where people can show a new faction or mode every week
[0:11:47] <whittacre> lliam01 that's the wrong warhammer
[0:11:48] <BliVru> Mongolian neanderthals with fucking Ice age Monsters!
[0:11:51] <+queaks> What chaos god does Pat align to?
[0:11:52] <sapphomet777> yes ogre army later as dlc
[0:11:55] <quantras6> Ogres are big lads who eat and fight

[0:12:18] <BliVru> @Monkeyweed21 Up to slaneesh, ogres ar stil embargoed
[0:12:20] <%oda_flobunaga> Total War Atilla is so fracking cool
[0:12:20] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:12:23] <cheapdoc> Makes sense
[0:12:27] <lliam01> is this fantasy warhammer then, yeah?
[0:12:29] <%Monkeyweed21> The start is by far the hardest part of Total War it gets easier as you go
[0:12:29] <+sonofthedeepsouth> can you do?
[0:12:35] <quantras6> He might also play Chaos Undivided
[0:12:38] <%EmanXLR> EmanXLR subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! pet the babies for me
[0:12:39] <Saturni_Rose> @lliam01 yep

[0:12:39] <SilverFaustX> shogun 2 is the best one
[0:12:41] <FievelFails> I love the wizard men in AOS it's what got me into the tabletop
[0:12:44] <%hermitsen> battle difficulty is absolutely not worth putting above normal anyway
[0:12:47] <@Ranryu692> march 3rd
[0:12:48] <kazadog> @lliam01 yup its the fantasy setting
[0:12:50] <+Shonen_hero> I always liked Total War Warhammer's campaign stuff

[0:13:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> Play on easy, shit's hard when you gotta stream and manage chat, people think that shit's easy but they're used to playing by themselves without distractions
[0:13:04] <sapphomet777> imagine he plays cathay KomodoHype
[0:13:04] <kazadaz> I've heard TW: Attila as a "survival horror turn-based strategy", and it's cool but it's just so hard to play
[0:13:08] <+Shonen_hero> not sure how I feel about the Vortex campaign
[0:13:09] <lliam01> cool! Less familar with fantasy but i always was interested
[0:13:09] <%MyNameIsRasus> why did you turn italian there for a sec

[0:14:18] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt fair enough, though if your beard is big enough thats not a problem
[0:14:18] <kazadog> @demon1103 does gamepass just straight up give you the game? if so if you get it in the first week ogres are free

[0:14:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt btw general consensus is that Nurgle is VERY not meta
[0:14:52] <%ChrisPlaysThing> 4 years, big peepee
[0:14:56] <%TubeMan642> Are the Skaven in this one?

[0:15:38] <%notsoy> skaven will not be playable on 3 until the immortal empires free dlc drops
[0:15:38] <%ChrisPlaysThing> That one kid was very surprised
[0:15:45] <pokketlint60> @TubeMan642 Skaven are in Total Warhammer 2. They're in Total Warhammer 3 as NPCs but aren't playable, but sometime after launch there's gonna be a big combined map that you can play if you own the previous games, and in that campaign you can play Skaven.
[0:15:56] <BliVru> @TubeMan642 You'll have to wait for the mortal empires patch

[0:16:21] <cheapdoc> That was the most beautiful poem I{ve ever heard
[0:16:29] <+rycon88> 😑
[0:16:30] <lamash7u> "I'm a lumberjack and I'm O-Kay!"
[0:16:33] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Speaking of RTS are there any ones more closer to StarCraft?
[0:16:40] <%maskofmichael> @Profmcstevie a very smart 10 year old
[0:16:45] <sirtommygunn> Which starcraft
[0:16:50] <kazadog> @legendfather_of_giants yes but the campaign map mechanics and plagues more than make up for it
[0:16:51] <azure_dunes> it was fun!!
[0:16:53] <sapphomet777> lizardmen copium is real i cant lie
[0:16:54] <%Shonen_hero> out of all the times where the story should be good, it's when you introduce the Chaos gods in full

[0:17:00] <+UltraViolet371> I was hoping you'd be sick today so we'd get more
[0:17:03] <%Dova573> Is the vod up on youtube?
[0:17:06] <sirtommygunn> there's not much like the first one but i feel like a lot of them are similar to 2
[0:17:07] <+sonofthedeepsouth> ursun be like I'm a God. Dies Kappa
[0:17:07] <BliVru> @NigelSchnauzerpug try Age of Darkness final stand
[0:17:17] <lloyddboy> damn im jealous
[0:17:19] <+RealThiele> Bozja is a bunch of bullshit and i hate it
[0:17:23] <Profmcstevie> It's weird mocking you and you can't say anything back....but they are fun LP/VOD streams
[0:17:34] <BliVru> uf
[0:17:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> NO ITS EVEN WORSE NOW
[0:17:34] <SolumFuturae> @RealThiele real and true
[0:17:37] <sapphomet777> kiev is rightfully BearLand
[0:17:38] <+EdgySalad> @patstaresat Hey Pat, are you doing my Pillars 2 or was last night's stream a one off?
[0:17:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @BliVru That does look like what I'm looking for. Thank you.
[0:17:43] <%notsoy> auto resolve is even worse now lmao
[0:17:46] <%oda_flobunaga> @NigelSchnauzerpug Grey Goo is like what would happen if Command and Conquer and Starcraft had a baby.
[0:17:46] <sapphomet777> **kislev
[0:17:48] <%MoaLaMoa> what faction are you playing Pat?
[0:17:48] <+queaks> Autoresolve is now based on Campaign difficulty
[0:17:49] <kazadog> autoresolve is total bullshit
[0:17:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> Autoresolve is harsher in this game than 2, in 2 it was pretty fair
[0:17:52] <quantras6> last I saw Auto Resolve now shows what you will lose
[0:17:53] <+rafaelba93> auto resolve is bad for the player on this one
[0:17:56] <+sonofthedeepsouth> fuck your shit up
[0:17:59] <%Man_in_the_Red> its the same auto resolve as usual, yet to see if its still racist like Tww2 auto resolve
[0:18:01] <lliam01> There we go, I looked up the factions in the game now. I like Slaanesh and Ogres.
[0:18:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> Autoresolve got made WAY less powerful this time, you lose way more @PatStaresAt
[0:18:03] <Quilltaz> autoresolve in total war is never good
[0:18:04] <%Shonen_hero> kind of suck
[0:18:05] <sirtommygunn> it's fine that auto resolve is a little bad, encourages you to play the battles
[0:18:06] <%Gogogolem> @PatStaresAt  The auto resolve bar is always racist.
[0:18:06] <Yomamma1337> autoresolve is for really easy fights
[0:18:12] <%SpontaneousC> auto-resolve will straight up throw fights that should be easy wins sometimes
[0:18:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> because the game incentivixes you to play the battles
[0:18:14] <BliVru> Auto resolve is awful for low armour factions
[0:18:16] <tranquilturnip> never auto resolve when its even REMOTELY close
[0:18:17] <kazadog> @lliam01 yeyeyeye ogres
[0:18:18] <+rycon88> Never auto resolve
[0:18:22] <%Monkeyweed21> auto resolve is for skipping faceroll fights
[0:18:26] <+SimplyRandy> By the end of WH2 they made some slight improvements for it, but it is still very biased
[0:18:26] <Saturni_Rose> play on normal and use time pause to assess the battle and cue up commands. that's how I got better
[0:18:27] <Quilltaz> i have had like 99% win in my autoresolve bar and i lost 2 of my important cavs
[0:18:31] <+queaks> Pat auto resolved OBS earlier
[0:18:32] <+RandyFistburgers> Time saver basically
[0:18:33] <+RealThiele> auto resolve lies at iffy fights
[0:18:35] <%MyNameIsRasus> Autoresolve is the Ryuji rank 8 skill
[0:18:35] <BliVru> actually no, its awful
[0:18:36] <%MoaLaMoa> autoresolve is always a waste of units, only good if you have a significantly larger army
[0:18:38] <quantras6> @bourgeoisdaemon there were times though it had a brainfart, like a full army against 3 units and saying I would lose
[0:18:41] <kazadog> good rule of thumb right there
[0:18:45] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt the auto resolve gets better as your general level up
[0:18:45] <person181> ya know what game had a good auto resolve?  endless legend
[0:18:47] <%Man_in_the_Red> luckily you know the casualties in 2 and 3
[0:18:48] <%Monkeyweed21> its a time saver, not a way to skip half the game
[0:18:52] <%Shonen_hero> that's about right
[0:18:55] <Profmcstevie> Auto resolve is for crushing a fucking Pidgey in your hands kinda battles
[0:18:56] <+queaks> I dont do it cause I like fighting the battles
[0:18:57] <+sonofthedeepsouth> fr fr deadass on god?
[0:18:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt it got nerfed for this one
[0:19:00] <+Laycas49> It shows you what units you lose in auto resolve in the latest warhammer II patch @PatStaresAt
[0:19:00] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:19:01] <kazadog> yes
[0:19:02] <%Kataguro> Kataguro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! Immortal Empires can't come soon enough, but I'm excited for the buggy launch all the same.  I know this is a Khorne and Nurgle household, but which of the other factions are you interested in trying?
[0:19:02] <Yomamma1337> they have SO MUCH gameplay out
[0:19:03] <%SethFace> Yes!
[0:19:03] <+SimplyRandy> There's been lots of coverage
[0:19:04] <%notsoy> the worst autoresolce foibles have been addressed
[0:19:05] <%Nekros4442> @quantras6 ...did you jsu have a full stack of skaven slaves?
[0:19:06] <%MyNameIsRasus> my dad works at nintendo
[0:19:06] <%Piemono> There's a fuckload of info about the game at this point
[0:19:08] <sapphomet777> unga bunga the unit #s
[0:19:09] <+queaks> Streamers have had it since January 18
[0:19:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Because we big smart
[0:19:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt content creators get to stream like 4 hours a day until release
[0:19:11] <%linSP> I played the campaign so well I hardly ever fight
[0:19:14] <sirtommygunn> your fans are fucking nerds pat
[0:19:16] <person181> we're hundreds of people, you're onepat
[0:19:17] <%MonsterEnvy> Autoresolve changed
[0:19:17] <@ssjklyco> this is like when you
[0:19:18] <darkodargon> Various streamers and youtubers
[0:19:18] <@PrefectusCorgi> You are
[0:19:19] <Profmcstevie> They have a LOT of stuff on stream
[0:19:19] <bourgeoisdaemon> Some Total War streamers have had it for specific factions for weeks
[0:19:20] <%twistedj3ster> you're special to me
[0:19:20] <%maskofmichael> Some people are just HUGE NERDS!
[0:19:21] <FievelFails> Is endless space 2 was amazing
[0:19:21] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt auto resolve has always worked that way
[0:19:21] <Klarrann3> there's lots of youtube videos out
[0:19:22] <BliVru> We can recommend you the channels if you want
[0:19:23] <+rafaelba93> total war focused youtubers
[0:19:23] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Because we actually play other TW games
[0:19:23] <+RealThiele> we are nerds tru
[0:19:24] <quantras6> @nekros4442 no, a normal army
[0:19:24] <+Nothing_Wild> Honestly, you can use it for a lot of fights.
[0:19:25] <%MoaLaMoa> wait did they make changes to auto resolve for total warhammer 3?
[0:19:26] <%Dementedpenguin> Pat, you're special to us.
[0:19:26] <kazadog> all the big total war streamers have had it for a little while now
[0:19:27] <%Shonen_hero> I've played like... a lot of TW; W 1 and 2
[0:19:30] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Nah noone is Kappa
[0:19:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> for the last few weeks
[0:19:31] <+ryderbootz> ppl like total war
[0:19:33] <%MoaLaMoa> it's always been the same in previous TWs
[0:19:34] <%Tearonex> well you ARE special, i other ways tho LUL
[0:19:36] <+Nothing_Wild> Obviously don’t if you are iffy.
[0:19:37] <Saturni_Rose> nah they just test ran these changes earlier in TW:WH2
[0:19:37] <+rycon88> Sorry pat
[0:19:37] <anAngryHamster> I played the Master of Orion reboot and I'd lose fights the auto resolve said would be 100% victory
[0:19:37] <darkodargon> You are cool pat
[0:19:38] <+Laycas49> People have been putting stuff on youtube for like a month
[0:19:39] <Anarbael> Other streams have been going hard on the game for a while
[0:19:39] <Klarrann3> you're still cool :3
[0:19:39] <+queaks> You are cool Pat and we are super jealous
[0:19:42] <+Sendaar> Does it still have the weird autoresolve thing where artillery is weighted waaay too much
[0:19:44] <quantras6> @nekros4442 they did fix it up a bit so it happened a lot less
[0:19:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait
[0:19:49] <sapphomet777> im autistic dude i love warhammer im gonna KNOW about the THINGS
[0:19:56] <%nick__sayre> Sounds like not much has changed! Guess I’ll remain watchin streams!
[0:20:00] <+Laycas49> The new TW III siege system is lit
[0:20:01] <+queaks> Minor settlements are so cool
[0:20:02] <%Pappajimbo> seige was slog
[0:20:02] <terrantom1990> When in doubt, remember the Hammer and Anvil, good old reliable hammer & anvil
[0:20:02] <%maskofmichael> you're only cool because you live in Canada
[0:20:03] <%Kataguro> TOWERS AND RAMS
[0:20:07] <kazadog> @sapphomet777 hell yeah my dude
[0:20:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Seiges battles are so much better
[0:20:10] <%Monkeyweed21> OH GOD SIEGES SUCKED SO HARD IN 2
[0:20:13] <bippityjones> The corner with the towers
[0:20:15] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Pat you should watch a guy called Okoii, makes doomstacks funny videos
[0:20:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> defending sieges was made harder because of the capture points
[0:20:19] <+sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:20:19] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt are there real naval battles in this one?
[0:20:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait.....You thought you were COOL?
[0:20:20] <+Nothing_Wild> I’ve been playing these games for almost 10 years. If you are iffy about the fight, then definitely.
[0:20:21] <quantras6> They let you make barricades and such right?
[0:20:23] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS SUCH AN IMPROVEMENT TO HAVE ACTUAL VARIETY
[0:20:24] <%SpontaneousC> nothing like sieging the super fortress Prague in TW2 and its the same lay out as every other city
[0:20:28] <BepBepAmShep> It's also good for when you don't think you can win, but the autoresolve somehow shows a win.
[0:20:29] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah it's more complex with sieges now, bit harder on the AI tho
[0:20:31] <%kittenby> I have 95 hours in TW:W2 and I STILL barely understand the RTS section. Keep getting wiped by much weaker units. Love it.
[0:20:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> @oda_flobunaga no
[0:20:35] <%MoaLaMoa> @Laycas49 any siege system will be better than warhammer I and II's
[0:20:35] <Anarbael> The siege battles are nice now
[0:20:37] <+Nothing_Wild> The maps in sieges for Warhammer were ass.
[0:20:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> Okoii makes funny videos with meme armies @PatStaresAt
[0:20:43] <+queaks> Okoii is amazing
[0:20:45] <%oda_flobunaga> damn it
[0:20:46] <Quilltaz> Okoii makes little short fun meme stuff
[0:20:49] <%MyNameIsRasus> "what the fuck are you talking about jessie"
[0:20:51] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> what race are you playing?
[0:20:51] <quantras6> Nurglings are the best and cutest
[0:20:55] <darkodargon> Doom stack is just all one unit @PatStaresAt
[0:20:55] <+sonofthedeepsouth> MEMESRY
[0:21:00] <sirtommygunn> doomstack is like a full army of all 1 unit
[0:21:01] <%Man_in_the_Red> Okoii is also a fan of The Orb
[0:21:01] <%VioletHeart> Doomstacks are entire armies of one unit that still manage to decimate, like 20 Imperial steam tanks.
[0:21:07] <sirtommygunn> usually an op one
[0:21:08] <%Shonen_hero> doom stacks sounds like you just pile a bunch of units together
[0:21:09] <+queaks> His 19 Nuglings video is a work of art
[0:21:09] <darkodargon> ye all the same unit
[0:21:11] <+rafaelba93> nop
[0:21:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Okoii is the Total War shitposter like Quiet Shy is the Warframe shitposter
[0:21:14] <Yomamma1337> doomstack = strongest possible army usually
[0:21:21] <%Chichen> ye
[0:21:22] <BepBepAmShep> yeah
[0:21:23] <DracaenaLeaf> ye
[0:21:23] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> doom stack is a 20 people army that can win against anything.
[0:21:26] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yepwe
[0:21:26] <%MyNameIsRasus> ye
[0:21:27] <ergulor> yes
[0:21:29] <Quilltaz> Pat legendary lord with 19 great unclean ones
[0:21:30] <ergulor> and a cute cat girl
[0:21:33] <scrumbotime> The Cthulu Yabbos
[0:21:35] <%Shonen_hero> yes
[0:21:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> And Cat thulu
[0:21:37] <+RealThiele> paige should ddef play that
[0:21:42] <bourgeoisdaemon> Doomstacking is when you make a deathball of 20x 1 super strong unit, it's suboptimal in 3 due to economy changes
[0:21:45] <+Kyma1020> yeaaah it's pretty good
[0:21:53] <+sonofthedeepsouth> What about the hitler one Kappa?
[0:21:56] <%Shonen_hero> L'neta for laifu
[0:21:57] <%oda_flobunaga> Give me a mod that mods the Doomslayer in as a unit, for the ultimate Doom stack

[0:22:30] <%SpontaneousC> wood elves are straight up Vietcong now and it's great
[0:22:31] <+invalid_robin> Rat men are the best
[0:22:32] <%Brassnarwhal> slanussy or bust
[0:22:32] <%MoaLaMoa> "don't care for the elves" WOAH THERE
[0:22:33] <ebrion> Slaanesh is the way
[0:22:34] <+RealThiele> ROCK AND STONE
[0:22:37] <+sonofthedeepsouth> people of the woods
[0:22:39] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Can you play as an entire army of Victor Saltzpyre?
[0:22:40] <mrtanaka111> they are called AELVES

[0:22:54] <+rycon88> For the emperor
[0:22:56] <%Monkeyweed21> Wood Elf AC-150 is best doomstack
[0:22:57] <quantras6> The best thing about Chaos Dwarfs sadly not being in at launch is that they'll likely get a really nice dlc like Tomb Kings
[0:22:58] <joodatious> @mrtanaka111 fuck off
[0:22:59] <%legendfather_of_giants> @mrtanaka111 not before AoS they're not

[0:23:23] <%Monkeyweed21> Shitting your pants is Nurgle for most people, but Slaneesh for a few people

[0:23:37] <person181> pat hold on i'm ordering cookies
[0:23:38] <%notsoy> when's kiryu in warhammer
[0:23:43] <%SethFace> Awful statement
[0:23:45] <quantras6> @kataguro goddamit please no let the lizards get SOMETHING
[0:23:47] <kazadaz> The other streamers are saying that autoresolve is MAJORLY tilted against the player in this one, like way more than usual
[0:23:55] <%Chichen> why is that book farting
[0:23:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> have you tried the Demon Prince at all?
[0:23:55] <+RealThiele> rip into that Slanussy
[0:23:59] <%oda_flobunaga> never look up the Sister of Nurgel

[0:24:03] <+BigCoffee> I'm eating pizza for the third time today
[0:24:06] <+coolercole> Ever had any interest in the tabletop source game?
[0:24:08] <%Shonen_hero> I got some oreos around somewhere
[0:24:10] <+Catpurnicus> So which came first, the War or the Hammer?
[0:24:16] <sirtommygunn> Streamers are also good at the game though so it's gonna be a bigger difference for them
[0:24:19] <%Shonen_hero> is that the Tzentech or whatever?
[0:24:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @notsoy your monkey's paw condition is that he only gets into 40k and he's a tau apologist
[0:24:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @quantras6 lizards still have space for a DLC and a rework at some point
[0:24:22] <+sonofthedeepsouth> messing with tzentch shit

[0:24:48] <quantras6> @monkeyweed21 they really need it. I like Lizards but they're boring to play as in the map
[0:24:50] <%vehementvadr> the tome of fates is the only text that has recorded the abhorrent things I did to your mother last night
[0:24:50] <lamash7u> When Immortal Empires is out I'd like to meet new and interesting peoples and creatures from far off lands as the Wood Elves... and kill them.
[0:24:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt that guy's the overarching villain btw
[0:24:52] <joodatious> stop lying chat
[0:24:54] <%oda_flobunaga> or maybe, a mod for this that changes it to the TTS verse
[0:24:55] <darkodargon> yes eveyone else has
[0:24:57] <%Man_in_the_Red> @catpurnicus the war did cause warhammer was originally a custom rule book for their old LOTR models to fight
[0:24:57] <sirtommygunn> one guy
[0:24:58] <%Monkeyweed21> YES YOU CAN
[0:25:04] <%MonsterEnvy> Thanks evil book

[0:25:12] <kazadog> ban that guy
[0:25:13] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Did you know Cathay and Kislev didn't even exist as armies in the tabletop?
[0:25:13] <%Kataguro> @quantras6 Here's your second fiddle afterthought factions, bro.  Sorry, we have to give the lions share of budget to Skaven/Kislev/Kislev/Whoever
[0:25:14] <%Monkeyweed21> only thing still embargoed is Ogres

[0:25:35] <%Shonen_hero> it looks sexy asf
[0:25:35] <Buttku> warhammer is such a great brand marred by GWs shite
[0:25:36] <%Dakuu75> You don't think he'd KNOW what he can/can't show to prevent DMCA and strikes on his channel, which is his lively-=hood?
[0:25:37] <%Chichen> do fights run above 10 fps
[0:25:37] <%Brassnarwhal> stop it chate we have OneGuy at home
[0:25:38] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Is it Ogre time?
[0:25:38] <%Kataguro> Kislev
[0:25:41] <+Nothing_Wild> @brassnarwhal Most people who aggressively shit on Tau tend to ignore most of the crap the Imperium does. I say this as a dude who’s into Eldar. Farsight is still based, though.
[0:25:42] <%Monkeyweed21> its a big improvement
[0:25:43] <%MyNameIsRasus> pat mom says it's my turn at the xbox now
[0:25:48] <quantras6> @patstaresat remember the weird as hell fighting game select screen for the lord's?
[0:25:48] <Saturni_Rose> I'm pretty sure there were a few Kislev units on the table if not an actual army
[0:25:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt he's the final villain of 1
[0:25:57] <+queaks> Ogres my lord
[0:25:59] <BliVru> he didn't do anything of vlue
[0:26:01] <+Catpurnicus> that dude needs better ventilation when painting his miniatures
[0:26:04] <+froduck42> He's voiced by Sage Freke from Demon Souls as well I think
[0:26:06] <$lotharrio> I'm just gonna say it. I would not live in the Warhammer world. Seems inconvenient. Everything is spiky and bloody.
[0:26:06] <bippityjones> bluhdh
[0:26:07] <%kittenby> "Ogre mercenaries my lord"
[0:26:07] <+Marsantas> He's weirdly absent in 2, he's big on 1
[0:26:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> No!
[0:26:08] <%Kataguro> He's bird boy
[0:26:09] <BliVru> depends
[0:26:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> he betrays you and summons Chaos
[0:26:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Well his bird was
[0:26:10] <%SpontaneousC> Yup
[0:26:11] <ebrion> Chaos!
[0:26:15] <%linSP> He’s the guy
[0:26:15] <%maskofmichael> What's the difference between WH and 40K, besides the hole "IN SPACE" part?
[0:26:15] <+queaks> He didnt really do much in 2
[0:26:16] <joodatious> @Saturni_Rose there weren't it was mostly made up from lore blurbs
[0:26:18] <huskarl_zap> For archaeon
[0:26:19] <%SpontaneousC> in 1 he's a secret daemon
[0:26:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @nothing_wild i think tau are cool i just know they are the ones to make fun of
[0:26:21] <%MelBrooksKA> What's that smell!?
[0:26:23] <+Meathands> He turns into Sarthorael in 1
[0:26:23] <%Monkeyweed21> he's a Tzeentch Cultist pushing everyone to do war
[0:26:25] <quantras6> @patstaresat he turns on archeon and is working for Tzeetch
[0:26:25] <+Catpurnicus> damn it ash
[0:26:26] <%Kataguro> KISLEV
[0:26:29] <CatRidder> is he the lich king?
[0:26:29] <kazadaz> There's a theory this game is actually a prequel to 1
[0:26:38] <+Catpurnicus> This is the one thing we didn't want to happen
[0:26:38] <%shurtal> Kislev? They Still fighting Aveh?
[0:26:41] <%Brassnarwhal> Abbadon?
[0:26:43] <huskarl_zap> @catridder no
[0:26:44] <Quilltaz> Just as keikaku'd
[0:26:46] <FievelFails> Pat say Hi to buttons for me

[0:26:48] <%Monkeyweed21> hey look the Prologue
[0:26:48] <$lotharrio> @maskofmichael In space i s the biggest difference. Though most of the factions are different too.
[0:26:48] <pokketlint60> 🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻🐻
[0:26:50] <sirtommygunn> just a theory
[0:26:52] <%Shonen_hero> D:

[0:27:02] <quantras6> oh this is the backstory for the OC Deamon Prince
[0:27:06] <+RandyFistburgers> Couldnt BEAR it
[0:27:09] <%oda_flobunaga> The fall of Cadia this ain't
[0:27:09] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Not much of a God if it can die kappa
[0:27:11] <Saturni_Rose> @joodatious coulda sworn their winged cav were playable in Empire.. but it has been a long time so I could easily be misremembering
[0:27:13] <joodatious> wow the production for these cutscenes are way better then the last game
[0:27:15] <%SpontaneousC> This is all New Exclusive Lore
[0:27:18] <Anarbael> ye quantras
[0:27:27] <%Kataguro> Go get Volibear back
[0:27:28] <%MonsterEnvy> It's a bear god
[0:27:29] <%Shonen_hero> you save that bear
[0:27:29] <Quilltaz> Bae'Lakor
[0:27:30] <+rycon88> Not much of a god, dying to a mere pistol
[0:27:30] <%AncelDeLambert> yes, bears are cool
[0:27:31] <bippityjones> Blue Bear in the Big Bad House
[0:27:31] <%MyNameIsRasus> BOO
[0:27:32] <%Cozy90> voldermort?
[0:27:32] <%Shonen_hero> he looks rad
[0:27:36] <Treasure_Vault> the total warhammer is the final upgrade in the warhammer weapon tree
[0:27:37] <blewbeary> the 1st demon prince
[0:27:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> big daddy Chaos
[0:27:40] <%hairtoday> BILLY NO
[0:27:40] <%Nekros4442> yep, big dick belakor
[0:27:40] <pokketlint60> White Daemon Jumpscare
[0:27:43] <$lotharrio> God vs Gun. Gun wins.
[0:27:43] <%AnthroMetal> The Band?
[0:27:43] <%PocketBearIllustrator> bears are my people
[0:27:43] <quantras6> BE'LACHAD
[0:27:44] <+queaks> Belakor is played by the main dwarf from the hobbit
[0:27:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Be'lakor has a cool model
[0:27:45] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Look out for falling rocks, Be'lakor!
[0:27:46] <joodatious> @Saturni_Rose they weren't, you might just be remembering kitbashes
[0:27:47] <%DianaTheAscian> Bear god looks cool
[0:27:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> Be'lakor the bear shackler
[0:27:48] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Bela'kor is a chad
[0:27:48] <darkodargon> IDk he offers good benefits
[0:27:50] <Sol_Install> is that wat they used as a ref volibear? curious
[0:27:51] <+gatdragon> Wonder how many dlcs will be in this one
[0:27:54] <%Monkeyweed21> he punked the Chaos Gods to be a sigma male
[0:27:55] <%oda_flobunaga> time to blay a childre's card game
[0:27:56] <+Smeagleman6> Ahh, Belakor!
[0:27:57] <BliVru> Literally the arch jerk
[0:27:58] <@PrefectusCorgi> The 1st Prince of Chaos
[0:27:59] <%Shonen_hero> more like god versus god gun
[0:28:01] <copyritetm> belacuck more luck
[0:28:03] <+Nothing_Wild> Really wish they went with a more historical direction for Kislev.
[0:28:03] <tanarath> You should speak a demon's name.
[0:28:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Belakussy
[0:28:10] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt He has an awesome new model
[0:28:10] <%AnthroMetal> be'lakor makes some cool ass music
[0:28:11] <tanarath> shouldn't
[0:28:12] <+rycon88> I’m getting a weird lord of the rings vibe
[0:28:15] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, is this one of those "you can be a god but it's dead man's boots" type of settings?
[0:28:17] <+RealThiele> wants that bear bussy
[0:28:18] <bippityjones> This guy's sounding like a real asshole
[0:28:19] <%Shonen_hero> bruh no
[0:28:21] <%AnthroMetal> @Pookiedaexzile oh no
[0:28:22] <%Shonen_hero> let that shit go
[0:28:23] <+p4ntless> be'lakor got canceled by the chaos gods and he still hasn't gotten over it
[0:28:27] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz I sorta hate that, I prefer Divine Spark settings
[0:28:29] <+Nothing_Wild> They look too Finnic or Siberian, honestly.
[0:28:32] <%oda_flobunaga> urssy
[0:28:36] <Saturni_Rose> @joodatious VERY likely yeah. I played skaven back in 7th so I mainly know their stuff
[0:28:38] <FievelFails> It's almost like it's high fantasy or something
[0:28:41] <+PMAvers> "I may need eight to twenty-four like-minded adventurers to raid the daemon's realm in search of treasures."
[0:28:41] <bippityjones> What could go wrong!
[0:28:47] <%Shonen_hero> wow this sounds like a terrible idea
[0:28:50] <%hewlettfan96> Pat u smell
[0:28:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> urssy is strong af
[0:28:51] <%Shonen_hero> go on
[0:28:52] <$lotharrio> Pat LOVES bears!
[0:28:53] <quantras6> @rycon88 I mean Warhammer is kind of like lord of the rings but going as hard as possible
[0:28:57] <+Meathands> A portal to the realms of Chaos? Sounds like a picnic!
[0:28:58] <tanarath> This sounds 100% fine
[0:28:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael they are oficially not part of the same cannon, 40k has a lot of transhumanism stuff but theres representation of a lot of wh fantasy factions, the chaos gods are pretty much the same the eldar factions are the space elves demons are still around. theres a lot of turning dudes to a bloody mist in 50k too
[0:29:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @shonen_hero Lets do it
[0:29:03] <lloyddboy> this "moving portrait" effect makes him look like he's gonna sing Baka Mitai
[0:29:05] <%Kataguro> Wow, this is way better than the Fighting Game roster
[0:29:06] <$lotharrio> Ogre boys!
[0:29:08] <Yomamma1337> GOOD LORD SELECT
[0:29:08] <+sonofthedeepsouth> time for poll
[0:29:11] <+Nothing_Wild> @shonen_hero It probably is, but hey! That’s Chaos.
[0:29:17] <person181> "sounds like a bad idea"-a good sum of warhammer AND 40K
[0:29:20] <mrtanaka111> kislev
[0:29:22] <+Catpurnicus> look, you don't get immortal tech-lich emperors by having good ideas
[0:29:22] <%KineticZen> Going to buy this just for BIG BOIS
[0:29:23] <sirtommygunn> thank goodness
[0:29:23] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @lotharrio not the kind I'm familiar with. :P
[0:29:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt he's currently trying to break a curse tzeentch gave him in 1 for failing, thats the book
[0:29:25] <ProfBadger> ah yes, the book who you're bound to giving you the means to open a door into chaos to give you the chance to break your curse. Not a trap at all.
[0:29:25] <+froduck42> Bear Army!
[0:29:28] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Do the different lords change your starting point on the map?
[0:29:28] <KitsuneCrew> RASPUTIN
[0:29:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> RA RA RASPUTIN
[0:29:30] <joodatious> kinda crazy how these cutscenes do a better job setting up its world then Lost Arks hyper production cutscenes
[0:29:31] <+Marsantas> It really feels like Mandalore dragging their ass in his vid actually got them to change things
[0:29:31] <%AncelDeLambert> yeaaaaaah, Lizard Empire!
[0:29:32] <quantras6> you didn't like the fighting game select
[0:29:32] <%Kataguro> I want them to add more unlockable characters
[0:29:33] <+scarman125> @PatStaresAt ironically enough it was like this in game 1
[0:29:35] <person181> as opposed to what GOOD RASPUTIN?
[0:29:38] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Ra-Ra-Rasputin
[0:29:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[0:29:40] <%TubeMan642> Go Slanesh!
[0:29:41] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Is it all ogre?

[0:30:11] <blackbaron98> ooo tentacle arm
[0:30:12] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Undivided always
[0:30:15] <pokketlint60> You don't have to beat the game to unlike Boris, you have to beat a special quest battle after holding all the Kislev cities
[0:30:16] <kazadog> @Ches_Neckbeard YUP
[0:30:17] <querc31> booby the destroyer
[0:30:22] <+RealThiele> who need they slanussy ate

[0:30:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Why Not
[0:30:41] <%Monkeyweed21> put ranged units near melee units for big bonusbo
[0:30:43] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Cathay and Kislev didn't even exist as armies in tabletop
[0:30:46] <copyritetm> You're just not very auspicious Paty
[0:30:47] <quantras6> NURGLECHADS
[0:30:48] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz I HATED the micro you had to do in RA3 with the Rising Sun
[0:30:49] <$lotharrio> I just want Chaos Dwarves, so bad.
[0:30:49] <+carafe741> if you have the other two games can you use all hte factions?
[0:30:50] <ergulor> pat
[0:30:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt Khorne is currently considered the strongest faction btw
[0:30:50] <+Sendaar> Most of the cathay faction is made up for this game right?
[0:30:51] <sirtommygunn> SKARBRAND HATES EVERYTHING
[0:30:52] <Pookiedaexzile> click the Ogies
[0:30:53] <ergulor> paige
[0:30:55] <Sol_Install> why no orge?
[0:30:56] <Saturni_Rose> make melee guys stand near ranged guys. ez
[0:30:56] <Manwad> Birdsquad caw!
[0:30:58] <%Shonen_hero> blood for skull throne, skull for blood throne
[0:30:58] <yomamma133713> No you see they're dragons disguised as humans.  Completely different :)
[0:30:59] <+sonofthedeepsouth> sex
[0:31:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> tweet tweet mother fucker
[0:31:01] <+Meathands> Kislev sort of did
[0:31:02] <%Monkeyweed21> 1 bob
[0:31:02] <+froduck42> Kislev did Catahy is new
[0:31:02] <+PMAvers> Just as Keikaku Boys
[0:31:02] <+sonofthedeepsouth> The coomers
[0:31:02] <blewbeary> theres Kislev models @PatStaresAt
[0:31:06] <huskarl_zap> Kislev did
[0:31:06] <%MonsterEnvy> They are cool
[0:31:06] <+RealThiele> YES.... YES!
[0:31:07] <%Kataguro> It's like Vampire Coast where they just wholecloth made them
[0:31:07] <%Brassnarwhal> YEAH SEX PERVERTS
[0:31:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they're bringing back the tabletop and probably giving them armies
[0:31:13] <+p4ntless> all you gotta do is put ranged units near melee units and bing bang you getta da bonus
[0:31:13] <twilight_cleric> TZEENTCH ALL THE WAY
[0:31:13] <+sonofthedeepsouth> Kislev existed
[0:31:13] <+froduck42> They may in future as well
[0:31:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Wait.......where are the 1 and 2 races?
[0:31:15] <joodatious> Cathay is 100% new stuff and new lore for this game
[0:31:16] <%hairtoday> they're one of the background factions
[0:31:17] <$realm_forge> Go Nurgle demon! He loves when you eat mold!
[0:31:17] <copyritetm> Cathay is actually brand new to Total War 3
[0:31:18] <%SpontaneousC> Kislev did, Cathay is fully original
[0:31:18] <%oda_flobunaga> Kislev exists in bloodbowl though
[0:31:20] <+Marsantas> Of course they are cool, the warhammer people didn't make them
[0:31:21] <bippityjones> We GOTTA go Nurgle
[0:31:22] <%MonsterEnvy> They are going to get lists in the new version of the tabletop
[0:31:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Click on the Ogres
[0:31:24] <lamash7u> Q: Why is everything in Warhammer made of skulls?  A: Most abundant resource.
[0:31:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Pookiedaexzile He can't
[0:31:26] <+queaks> They literally ran out of people to Add
[0:31:27] <tanarath> They are, but Warhammer is weird
[0:31:30] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Cathay was barely mentioned, it was basically a footnote
[0:31:32] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> nooope
[0:31:32] <Saturni_Rose> it's pronounced "tuh zeench"
[0:31:33] <%SpontaneousC> And both of them are going to be informed by this for the Old World tabletop reboot
[0:31:33] <bourgeoisdaemon> Games Workshop is using this game as an opportunity to introduce Kislev/Cathay as concepts without risking making a line of Minis that don't have recognition
[0:31:35] <+Smeagleman6> In the new game coming out in a few years, both Kislev and Cathay will be in
[0:31:35] <St33l_Titan> they don't exist *Yet* they are coming in 'the old world'
[0:31:36] <+alphonseisbest> when does this come out?
[0:31:36] <sirtommygunn> Yell at Games Workshop about it until they agree to let them make Ind
[0:31:38] <joodatious> They said they're adding every army plus more
[0:31:38] <Yomamma1337> total war warhammer 40k when?
[0:31:39] <+froduck42> No Chaos Dwarves though
[0:31:39] <kazadaz> They're gonna keep making this game for the next five years
[0:31:39] <+coolercole> the table top has iterated since this total war series started
[0:31:39] <quantras6> @patstaresat Games Workshop is making a new fantasy thing for Warhammer, they worked with Creative Assembly to make them and put them in the game
[0:31:41] <%oda_flobunaga> good
[0:31:41] <anAngryHamster> Did they bring back the pygmies?
[0:31:42] <Quilltaz> the thing about games workshop is they like to hint at cool shit outside of the empire, then they NEVER expanded on literally anything outside the empire and then they nuked fantasy instead of doing anything with anything east of the dorf mountains
[0:31:42] <%Shonen_hero> you know what? I trust Creative Assembly
[0:31:43] <+RealThiele> RIP Lizardmen
[0:31:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Cathay used to be like 5 paragraphs of vaguely racist lore
[0:31:43] <+Ches_Neckbeard> 40k!
[0:31:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HMMMM
[0:31:44] <Shacklebox> yep, last oe
[0:31:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Chaos Dwarfs
[0:31:46] <%Kataguro> Lord of the Rings probably
[0:31:47] <%Nekros4442> Theres still Nippon lol
[0:31:47] <$lotharrio> Warcraft?!
[0:31:47] <TheRelaxedOne> yeah, after this you get into WArhammer 40K times
[0:31:48] <BliVru> cough 40k cough
[0:31:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> 4OK 40K
[0:31:50] <%SpontaneousC> LOTR
[0:31:50] <+queaks> They can still add Chaos Dwarves, Ind, Kurresh and Nippon
[0:31:50] <%MoaLaMoa> sad. but i'm looking so forward to medieval 3, been waiting a decade for it
[0:31:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> complete
[0:31:51] <%maskofmichael> pick the orcs by accident
[0:31:51] <joodatious> not 40k lmao
[0:31:51] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Creative Assembly worked with Games Workshop and basically built em from the ground up
[0:31:52] <+p4ntless> when GW brings back old warhammer Cathay and Kislev are basically confirmed to be getting full ranges of minis
[0:31:52] <%terrorengine> Star Trek?
[0:31:52] <+rycon88> They will have everyone eventually
[0:31:52] <%Shonen_hero> ;-;
[0:31:53] <terrantom1990> Kislev had some models, but they were only an allies option
[0:31:53] <blackbaron98> 40k
[0:31:53] <bippityjones> The Ultimate 200$ Videogame Warhammer Experience
[0:31:54] <+Nothing_Wild> @sendaar Pretty much, though it’s very likely they’re part of the relaunch. They showed concepts for their WHF relaunch that were for Kislev, which those were used for this game.
[0:31:55] <%shurtal> Total 40k
[0:31:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> There's 40000 possibilities
[0:31:56] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Total War 40k would be rad
[0:31:56] <twilight_cleric> I mean, I'd give my left nut for 40k
[0:31:57] <%Shonen_hero> I don't believe you
[0:31:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DO IT
[0:31:59] <%king_wragles> Unrelated: Wasn't Dark Crusade cool as shit?
[0:31:59] <+ninjabush> yeah and instead of making them a thing games workshop just said "LETS BLOW UP THE WORLD"
[0:32:00] <%barrakuta371> Alien Isolation 2
[0:32:01] <%oda_flobunaga> 40 K wouldn't work well
[0:32:02] <%terrorengine> oh
[0:32:02] <%MonsterEnvy> 40k won't fit as well as fantasy
[0:32:02] <$eternalnorth232> 40k
[0:32:03] <%Kataguro> 40K would be really bad for this
[0:32:03] <+rycon88> 40k
[0:32:04] <%Shonen_hero> THEY SHOULD
[0:32:04] <%strakillias> 40k would not work with this formula
[0:32:04] <+sonofthedeepsouth> not 40k. it wouldn't work
[0:32:06] <%Shonen_hero> they won't
[0:32:06] <BliVru> It's really complicated to adapt into this engine
[0:32:06] <%king_wragles> Man, if only we got Dark Crusade again
[0:32:07] <%Brassnarwhal> i hope they do 40k ones next i like that setting more
[0:32:08] <+RandyFistburgers> yuh
[0:32:08] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:32:09] <%Shonen_hero> because they're cowards
[0:32:09] <+coolercole> I mean, 40k
[0:32:10] <+sonofthedeepsouth> IT WOULD NOT WORK
[0:32:11] <joodatious> they're never doing 40k lmao
[0:32:11] <quantras6> They properly will or find some other fantasy setting
[0:32:13] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> YEAH NURGLE
[0:32:15] <$lotharrio> Why no Ogre Kingdoms?
[0:32:15] <@DakotaMacDoodle> Alien Vs Predator Total War
[0:32:15] <+ryderbootz> ehhh Id take an AoS over 40k for total war
[0:32:15] <joodatious> FUCK META
[0:32:15] <%kittenby> Why do 40k when theres a perfectly good Greyhawk they can use?
[0:32:16] <+ninjabush> YES IKKY BOY LOVE IT
[0:32:16] <+puffinup> they wont tho
[0:32:17] <+queaks> They LOVE being gross
[0:32:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BUT KHORNE THO
[0:32:18] <Nikbottom> We won’t know for a long time
[0:32:18] <Shacklebox> how?
[0:32:19] <+Smeagleman6> 40k Total War would be fantastic
[0:32:19] <$realm_forge> Obligatory fuck GW message
[0:32:19] <quantras6> NURGLECHADS, IT'S TIME
[0:32:20] <pokketlint60> Nurgle with a Hard R
[0:32:20] <count_bob> I'm just waiting for Tilea.
[0:32:21] <Surprise_Anole> get that chaos stank
[0:32:21] <%shruke> Total War warhammer war of the Hammers
[0:32:21] <huskarl_zap> shit on stream
[0:32:22] <+alphonseisbest> when does this come out?
[0:32:22] <person181> we're not playing online who gives  A FUCK about metta
[0:32:22] <Saturni_Rose> LOTR seems most likely to me. 40k seems at odds with CA's other stuff tbh
[0:32:22] <terrantom1990> 40k would not work dude
[0:32:23] <%AncelDeLambert> just gimme the ability to play as the fucking Tau, please
[0:32:23] <+froduck42> with the stink lines and everything
[0:32:23] <%Monkeyweed21> NURGLE IS WIERD AS SHIT
[0:32:24] <+rafaelba93> they can
[0:32:24] <%KineticZen> Grandfather Nurgle
[0:32:24] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> The games not even out, how is there a meta
[0:32:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> it reminds pat of Piage
[0:32:25] <kazadaz> I'd like it if CA made a 40K game, but I feel like it doesn't suit the structure of TW
[0:32:26] <%shurtal> would Gief be a Nuurgal?
[0:32:27] <TheRelaxedOne> Nurgle is fine, not so fast though
[0:32:27] <%Shonen_hero> just like Zangief
[0:32:27] <+RealThiele> mold Orb
[0:32:27] <+Ches_Neckbeard> where is Zangief?
[0:32:29] <%oda_flobunaga> WW1 total War
[0:32:29] <%MyNameIsRasus> Nurgle with a hard r
[0:32:29] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> at the end, everyone of note will be here basically, so its fine if its the end
[0:32:29] <$valkuma> @PatStaresAt 40k where the campaign is a single planet and the single player story is a galaxy of planets
[0:32:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis Pat playing videogames sub-optimally
[0:32:30] <+temsik> YEAH STINKY BOIZ
[0:32:32] <%Cozy90> THE NURGLE R HOT
[0:32:32] <+alphonseisbest> tyty
[0:32:36] <gingemahminge1> LEEEEESEEEEEETS GOOOOOO
[0:32:36] <+rbakervv> @alphonseisbest the 17th
[0:32:36] <+Nothing_Wild> People keep saying 40K, but I honestly don’t see how that could work with line and ranks.
[0:32:37] <+puffinup> there's so many reasons for why 40k will never have a total war game
[0:32:38] <%AncelDeLambert> I want my dumb psychic weebs, I want my missiles
[0:32:42] <Shacklebox> nurgle buildings are gonna piss him off
[0:32:43] <%terrorengine> hey, its the guy from warcraft
[0:32:43] <+DisplayNameTaken> Nurgle more like Turdgle
[0:32:44] <%terrorengine> !
[0:32:44] <lamash7u> I think the Wargame/WARNO guys should be the ones that make a big Epic/Apocalypse scale 40K game.
[0:32:46] <+sonofthedeepsouth> HE IS YOU PAT
[0:32:48] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> HERE COME THE STANK
[0:32:48] <%Brassnarwhal> why wouldn't 40k work in this genre they are both based off of what was once very similar aystems and shit
[0:32:49] <+p4ntless> DA NURGUSSY
[0:32:50] <BliVru> infantry
[0:32:51] <kazadaz> Infantry
[0:32:56] <gingemahminge1> PAPA NURGLE HERE TO SAVE YOU FROM HURT
[0:32:57] <Nikbottom> It’s a nice chair
[0:32:58] <%Shonen_hero> god there's so many games coming out this month, and then at the first week of March
[0:33:00] <%Shonen_hero> just fml
[0:33:00] <%Kataguro> Small Boyz
[0:33:00] <quantras6> Can't wait to see some Nurglings get shit on
[0:33:01] <sirtommygunn> Yes
[0:33:02] <tanarath> Given GW's track record, they will take away the license, like they did with the dark heresy people, after that tabletop rpg series was popular & they'd finally started balancing it
[0:33:03] <+RealThiele> throw more nurglings at it
[0:33:03] <%MyNameIsRasus> THAT NURGUSSY IS SO STANK
[0:33:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah it's your basic guys
[0:33:05] <@PrefectusCorgi> Yes
[0:33:06] <+ninjabush> nurgling good
[0:33:07] <+queaks> Yeah get lots of those
[0:33:09] <TheRelaxedOne> Those are pretty good
[0:33:10] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA THE SWARM
[0:33:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Wet ass Nurgussy
[0:33:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Nurglussy
[0:33:13] <Brutusness> I'm picking up some plague marines this weekend hell yeah
[0:33:17] <Shacklebox> yes
[0:33:17] <Saturni_Rose> tiny rowdy boys
[0:33:18] <BliVru> Their animations are top tier
[0:33:18] <+temsik> papa nurgle loves you <3
[0:33:20] <quantras6> @shonen_hero what else besides Elden Ring?
[0:33:21] <Anarbael> Doomstacks of nurglings
[0:33:21] <+Catpurnicus> so like a stinky zergling?
[0:33:22] <%Monkeyweed21> they are your free chaff meant to die
[0:33:22] <+RandyFistburgers> baby nurg number go up
[0:33:25] <+puffinup> mainly because total war can't handle squad based combat
[0:33:25] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt why Nerglings and not Nuggets?
[0:33:26] <%AncelDeLambert> so how much base building do I get to do?
[0:33:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> Nurgussy or Nurglussy?
[0:33:28] <%Brassnarwhal> you already have a nurgling you wipe his burgers all the time
[0:33:29] <Shacklebox> your chaff is chaffier
[0:33:30] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz that's the fun part
[0:33:31] <%sniffy77> sniffy77 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! Pat, what are you most excited for in elden ring? I'm excited to maybe finally be able to run a legit spellsword buuild without feeling like i'm sacrificing too many other stats.
[0:33:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> More lords and WAY more units over time
[0:33:35] <+rycon88> Yeah basic bitches
[0:33:37] <+RealThiele> i prefer Nurgussy
[0:33:38] <+p4ntless> gotta get two whole nostrils of that nurgussy before you go in
[0:33:39] <joodatious> @Brassnarwhal they're not similar at all, the Tabletop systems and such are very different it would need to be more of a Dawn of War game
[0:33:41] <%Brassnarwhal> @reallybigrocks nurgussy for aure
[0:33:42] <%Xelig> Does this game build off of the first 2 like 2 did to 1? Like is it worth buying the old ones to play around with that content in the new game?
[0:33:42] <%Man_in_the_Red> not to mention the old chaos lord'll get folded into these factions
[0:33:43] <+puffinup> or trenches or terrain or etc
[0:33:49] <+sonofthedeepsouth> DLC
[0:33:50] <%Shonen_hero> Shadow Warrior 3, there's also that Yoko Taro card ghame
[0:33:51] <blewbeary> ya
[0:33:52] <joodatious> @Xelig yrd
[0:33:54] <joodatious> yes
[0:33:57] <%ChrisPlaysThing> CHAOS
[0:33:59] <kazadaz> Total Warhammer has a bigger character roster than most fighting games
[0:33:59] <bossbear> @Xelig yes but not off the bat
[0:34:01] <%Xelig> sick
[0:34:01] <pokketlint60> Pat you would love Tamurkhan, he's a fatass Nurgle warrior who is friends with evil dwarfs. He'll probably be DLC
[0:34:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> see idk I like the L sound in Nurglussy
[0:34:03] <%MonsterEnvy> Nurglings are your fodder you can sacrifice them freely
[0:34:05] <quantras6> @shonen_hero oh yeah
[0:34:06] <BliVru> @Xelig Yes, you can get everything when mortal empires patch drops
[0:34:09] <%Monkeyweed21> originally it was JUST Daemons of Chaos yea
[0:34:13] <%MonsterEnvy> You are fine on nomral
[0:34:16] <TheRelaxedOne> neh, keep it like that
[0:34:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Why Do the Demons get there own tab
[0:34:16] <%XzileGaming> EZ Mode has been unlocked
[0:34:17] <Deleran> Papa Nurgle :D
[0:34:18] <+queaks> You can do it Normal Pat!
[0:34:19] <%notsoy> wh2 currently has 75 legendary lords iirc
[0:34:22] <%oda_flobunaga> Journalist mode?
[0:34:22] <+Shoosler> so far the ui looks much nicer than WH2
[0:34:24] <$boggsz12> throatin' some nurglizzy
[0:34:25] <copyritetm> I love this loading screen art
[0:34:26] <quantras6> NURGLE GANG
[0:34:28] <%shurtal> "Pat came to regret that decision"
[0:34:30] <%sniffy77> yeah papa nurgle
[0:34:30] <$Order_of_Mystery> where the lizardmen at?
[0:34:31] <+p4ntless> @xelig yup, the combined map with everything from 1 and 2 pprted into 3 will be out a few months after 3 launches
[0:34:31] <+Marsantas> Bean dad smiles upon you
[0:34:33] <%AncelDeLambert> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:34:33] <joodatious> this game is gonna be insane once all the games are smashed together
[0:34:35] <%Monkeyweed21> STINKY TIME
[0:34:35] <%Shonen_hero> I wonder if they plan on doing anything with the Warriors of Chaos
[0:34:38] <TrollKing96> So they gave Chaos Undivided it's own faction?
[0:34:38] <joodatious> a few months
[0:34:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> months
[0:34:39] <Saturni_Rose> you explained that weird but I understand what you mean
[0:34:40] <BliVru> 6 months?
[0:34:42] <Pookiedaexzile> That one in the middle has a gapping Nurglussy
[0:34:42] <Anarbael> look at how gross and happy they look like
[0:34:42] <+Nothing_Wild> @brassnarwhal Probably the same reason that people stopped fighting in line and ranks in the real world. Works for a smaller skirmish game on a tabletop. But gameplay would need to be really different. It could work, but battles wouldn’t be as slow as TW. It’d have to be closer to Halo Wars or Endwar.
[0:34:43] <%strakillias> 2 or 3 months I think
[0:34:43] <joodatious> less then a year
[0:34:43] <+PMAvers> "Do I want to" and "Should I" are different questions.
[0:34:44] <%Kataguro> Not that long I think?
[0:34:45] <%Xelig> I have the first but never got the second, or any of the dlc
[0:34:45] <+queaks> I think combined theres a total of 48 Legendary Lords between all 3 games
[0:34:46] <+froduck42> It was a while
[0:34:46] <%MonsterEnvy> 6 months I think
[0:34:50] <%Monkeyweed21> 3 months
[0:34:53] <%Shonen_hero> probably three or four months
[0:34:56] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> I expect it maayyyyybe this summer
[0:34:57] <Shacklebox> 3 months
[0:34:57] <%Man_in_the_Red> considering how MANY lords have to be rebalanced, this'll take a while
[0:35:00] <joodatious> it was around 3 for the last time
[0:35:00] <quantras6> I'm going to wait on Immortal Empires first tbh
[0:35:15] <%Shonen_hero> god I can't wait, I don't think I'll touch it until that comes out
[0:35:19] <%Shonen_hero> I want all duh warriors
[0:35:21] <Shacklebox> this might take longer tbh
[0:35:25] <+p4ntless> it'll be out by the time I'm done with elden ring and horizon and that's fuckin perfect
[0:35:27] <%FunkyStreams> Father of PLague?
[0:35:28] <kazadaz> Mortal Empires took exactly 1 month (but this one will deffo take longer)
[0:35:28] <+Catpurnicus> dank brews
[0:35:28] <Saturni_Rose> yeah something tells me "Immortal Empires" will take a bit longer
[0:35:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> it'll be longer this time because they have to rebalance magic completely
[0:35:30] <BliVru> Covid 3 is in development
[0:35:31] <%Monkeyweed21> The old races already have new siege maps in the game so most of the hard work is doen
[0:35:31] <%Brassnarwhal> @nothing_wild didnt they already make one of these for 40k? i thought there was one and people were mad about it for some reason
[0:35:31] <huskarl_zap> Go to the Death guardsansions in the hills
[0:35:34] <+RandyFistburgers> Eli?
[0:35:36] <%Kataguro> Kugath put the mold in Paige's potato salad
[0:35:36] <Treasure_Vault> plague daddy
[0:35:38] <+itsgundamu> I love Kugath's voice
[0:35:38] <$scallycap> gross
[0:35:43] <joodatious> @quantras6 u should try it out before hand, the campaign for 3 is apparently REALLY good
[0:35:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> big ick
[0:35:46] <quantras6> I love it
[0:35:50] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Kugath ate Nurgles greatest plague. the bastard
[0:35:52] <%Cozy90> THATS HOT
[0:35:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine the Smell
[0:35:53] <+lildoc_911> I wanna fuck it.
[0:35:55] <+Nothing_Wild> @brassnarwhal Do you mean Dawn of War?
[0:35:56] <joodatious> fat stinky grandmpa
[0:35:56] <%BinaryFireball> BinaryFireball subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! yo pat did you get a chance to play the khorne daemons? are they good??
[0:35:57] <%Man_in_the_Red> @brassnarwhal yeah Dawn of War, but this is half 4X and not entirely RTS
[0:35:58] <+ninjabush> this boy got Disney villan vibes
[0:35:59] <+queaks> He sounds so good
[0:36:00] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> an understandable period of months, considering they will be putting the entirety of two whole games into one massive whole-world of a map
[0:36:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Brassnarwhal no, theres the Dawn of War games, but those are closer to Starcraft than this
[0:36:02] <ergulor> god bear?
[0:36:02] <huskarl_zap> Tell pat about the Isha jar
[0:36:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt are you excited for the smegma spell
[0:36:02] <$lotharrio> Ku'gath's cum jar was in full display.
[0:36:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @nothing_wild probably
[0:36:07] <quantras6> @joodatious I might but Elden Ring first
[0:36:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @huskarl_zap no Isha jar in Fantasy
[0:36:22] <+p4ntless> the fetid nurgussy shaft
[0:36:22] <%Kataguro> Da God Pox
[0:36:23] <gingemahminge1> On every level except physical, I am a nurgling
[0:36:29] <+Catpurnicus> he's super hype, damn
[0:36:29] <%Shonen_hero> WutFace
[0:36:29] <+izanagi22> Howdy Pat, Howdy Chat
[0:36:31] <copyritetm> What a sweety
[0:36:32] <+Nothing_Wild> @brassnarwhal Because  that was a really different game. Creative Assembly did work on Halo Wars.
[0:36:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @legendfather_of_giants the word war is used to many times I can't keep it straight
[0:36:35] <+ryderbootz> Woah i didnt know pats mom was in the game
[0:36:37] <%Shonen_hero> don't hurt my bear daddy
[0:36:39] <joodatious> these games have such good voice work
[0:36:40] <+p4ntless> this is nurgle's radiator and kugath is his glass jar
[0:36:40] <Ipsenscastle> the animation is fantastically done
[0:36:42] <Shacklebox> he's so snotty
[0:36:43] <pokketlint60> I'm happy we finally get to see the Advisor actually meeting the Legendary Lords. You never got to actually see this in the previous games
[0:36:45] <kazadaz> Oh shit he used the H word
[0:36:48] <quantras6> Nurglings are the bestest and cutest!
[0:36:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> cover the concept art in stink fume simulations
[0:36:50] <r0termond> WutFace
[0:36:52] <person181> HE DIDN'T SAY IT HAD T9O BE UNTAINTED BLOOD
[0:36:52] <+izanagi22> Worked for Yakuza 0, it can work for this
[0:36:52] <$zyberion626> "Let's make God Covid!"
[0:36:53] <gingemahminge1> He’s so polite, nurgle boys are always so polite
[0:36:54] <Shacklebox> a LOT of effects
[0:36:56] <Pookiedaexzile> Why would you trust that Face
[0:36:57] <%sniffy77> he's so happy!

[0:37:17] <%maskofmichael> BODY FOR THE MOLD GOD
[0:37:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @nothing_wild oh the reason people were mad was because the warhammer one was better than the mainline ones at the time
[0:37:18] <BedHome> you are an evil rotten egg
[0:37:18] <stegosaurus_md> everyone wins!
[0:37:21] <+p4ntless> nurgle is the only chaos god who will ever love and appreciate you and that makes him the best

[0:37:39] <Talliemon> what a lovely poem
[0:37:42] <%Cozy90> This kinda reminds me of Etherlords
[0:37:42] <quantras6> @scallycap the old guy just wants a drop of blood, doesn't care if he's working for someone to kill the bear or save it
[0:37:42] <$realm_forge> Nurgle worshippers are proficient at Smash Bros
[0:37:43] <%Brassnarwhal> @queaks he is
[0:37:44] <+izanagi22> Sick bars
[0:37:44] <sirtommygunn> Nurgle faction is just so jolly about all the horrific shit they do, love em
[0:37:45] <+rycon88> Does the old man really think this won’t end horribly for him?
[0:37:48] <bippityjones> Oh no he's rhyming, it's even scarier now
[0:37:50] <%cooldude69xx> This nurgle guy doesnt seem chill
[0:37:51] <coridal_mercenary> A LITERAL deal with the devil
[0:37:51] <+lildoc_911> what is he a disney villain?
[0:37:53] <%kittenby> The icons arent animated anymore D:
[0:37:54] <pokketlint60> Lol at Ogres being the starting enemies for Nurgle. Thicc vs. Thicc
[0:37:54] <%Kataguro> Weird that the portraits aren't animated
[0:37:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> attrition time baybee
[0:37:57] <kazadaz> I wish we was goin to Candyapple Island
[0:38:01] <Manwad> can't believe nurgle's making black plague 2
[0:38:02] <tanarath> Gallows Tree
[0:38:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @coridal_mercenary *a* devil
[0:38:07] <%pokefan9956> pokefan9956 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Hey Dr. Orbman. Keep up the great work. You'll catch that blue hedgehog soon enough man
[0:38:07] <joodatious> a kiss of pestilence upon your cheek
[0:38:09] <+SilverDevilfish> Ogres my lord
[0:38:10] <%kittenby> Ahhhhh
[0:38:12] <+itsgundamu> aww
[0:38:16] <%Shonen_hero> that's probably wise
[0:38:17] <%Kataguro> Ahhhhh, that makes way more sense
[0:38:21] <kazadaz> @Manwad A Bigger Blacker Plague
[0:38:28] <BliVru> @Manwad That was actually a Skaven invention
[0:38:30] <Ace5335> 2d images looks better anyways
[0:38:30] <%Shonen_hero> also don't use blood whenever it comes out
[0:38:31] <Saturni_Rose> OGRES MY LORD
[0:38:32] <bippityjones> Dwarfs are in this game?
[0:38:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> just put more juice in the computer
[0:38:32] <+queaks> Are they still animated on the character screens?
[0:38:33] <Shacklebox> yuuppp
[0:38:34] <+lildoc_911> poorly optimized warhammer games? no.
[0:38:35] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah and the portraits don't add much
[0:38:36] <joodatious> thats always the first thing you should do when playing total war games
[0:38:37] <%kittenby> I dont notice that in 2 on my PC but im also not streaming so
[0:38:38] <$lotharrio> Man I hope those dwarves don't have any grudges.
[0:38:39] <%Shonen_hero> that shit bogs your game so hard
[0:38:41] <gingemahminge1> Just gonna clap some ogre cheeks
[0:38:54] <%Pappajimbo> total war games have always been hogs for pc juice
[0:39:01] <+Shoosler> @PatStaresAt could you zoom out and show the map once you're able please??
[0:39:01] <%Man_in_the_Red> gotta have full models loaded just to have diplomacy active at a click with animated portraits
[0:39:05] <Nikbottom> Optimization is last on the list for any game
[0:39:05] <%king_wragles> You shall bring Missouri ?
[0:39:06] <kazadaz> Bring Missouri upon its people before defiling their god
[0:39:07] <hexen109> bring Misouri upon them
[0:39:07] <+rafaelba93> 2 got optimized
[0:39:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @lotharrio that wouldnt be very dwarfy
[0:39:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt campaign performs worse, battle better
[0:39:10] <%Kataguro> Plague it up, Plague of Gripes
[0:39:15] <joodatious> its the best running warhammer game on launch
[0:39:19] <pokketlint60> We don't want to bring "misery" to people, we want to make them happy in Papa Nurgle's love!
[0:39:25] <%Monkeyweed21> its a better engine but theres no day 1 patch or driver
[0:39:26] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Papa Nurgle loves all his children
[0:39:27] <joodatious> so its a good sign for things to come
[0:39:29] <%maskofmichael> You shall bring Missouri
[0:39:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> UNLEASHED NEW JERSEY UPON THEM
[0:39:30] <pokketlint60> Hey Pat do you speak Nurglish?
[0:39:33] <+lildoc_911> I feel the warp overtaking me, it is a good pain!
[0:39:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Speak Nurglish KKona
[0:39:34] <%Man_in_the_Red> The Fence Shall Rise to the Heavens
[0:39:36] <bippityjones> Weird
[0:39:37] <%Kataguro> Oh that's super weird
[0:39:38] <sirtommygunn> oh nice
[0:39:42] <+sonofthedeepsouth> nurglish
[0:39:51] <GarbageNirvana> I forget, are these games real time or
[0:39:52] <person181> does the world rot around where you're cities are?
[0:39:53] <%Brassnarwhal> geif definitely speaks nurglish
[0:39:53] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurgle is the weirdest faction in game 3 by far
[0:39:55] <+lildoc_911> i don't like that word...lol
[0:39:57] <+RandyFistburgers> A nurgle jerk
[0:40:03] <kazadaz> Don't piss all over Slaanesh that just makes him stronger
[0:40:06] <%Shonen_hero> why can't all the chaos gods just get along?
[0:40:13] <%Valdorick> Its not your house, in the middle of the street.
[0:40:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> u gotta know Nurglish to get up in this Nurglussy
[0:40:16] <bossbear> as for somebody who just watched the plague marines video .... pretty happy with this .
[0:40:17] <gingemahminge1> psaBougie
[0:40:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadaz facts
[0:40:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> you start Sunken sewers
[0:40:20] <GeneralHysterics> ~our house~
[0:40:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @GarbageNirvana the campaign map is turn based, battles are RTS
[0:40:23] <%Shonen_hero> yeah Slaneesh'd be into it
[0:40:24] <bossbear> Kappa
[0:40:25] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> gotta fight 3 other assholes to corrupt the world with stank
[0:40:26] <quantras6> When is the Warriors of Chaos going to get a goddamn rework
[0:40:26] <GeneralHysterics> ~in the middle of the map~
[0:40:31] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Tzeench FUCKS UP nurgle. Best to avoid them
[0:40:31] <tanarath> CHOESE
[0:40:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @shonen_hero that's what chaos undivided is
[0:40:45] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt
[0:40:45] <gingemahminge1> When pat start abusing the game mechanics to get mad cash
[0:40:47] <+BahaPrisdimee> if all the chaos gods could get along there'd be nothing left
[0:40:49] <sirtommygunn> Your only artillery unit as Nurgle iirc
[0:40:49] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the game is balanced for Ultra size now btw
[0:40:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Shonen_hero Name something slaneesh isn't into
[0:40:50] <quantras6> CUTE NURGLINGS
[0:40:51] <%Shonen_hero> @ReallyBigRocks think of all the STDs you'd get from nergussy
[0:40:52] <gingemahminge1> psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie psaBougie
[0:40:52] <Visorak6> nurglings are the best
[0:40:54] <%Joshbored> fuck im late, how far into the game are we
[0:40:54] <pokketlint60> uWu
[0:40:55] <%sniffy77> chaos furries
[0:40:57] <+Ches_Neckbeard> now I need to know if Paige finds Nurgle Men or Ogre's more attractive
[0:40:58] <FievelFails> Aw damn he went nurgle
[0:40:59] <BliVru> You playing with Ultra unit sizes?
[0:40:59] <sendart> OWO
[0:41:00] <bourgeoisdaemon> Furies are garbaggio
[0:41:04] <kazadaz> Yeah I heard that too
[0:41:05] <+sonofthedeepsouth> furries?

[0:41:07] <count_bob> @doc_ock_rokc Nurgle.
[0:41:09] <+rafaelba93> ultra is always best
[0:41:10] <%MonsterEnvy> I heard it a lot
[0:41:11] <FievelFails> @Joshbored not far
[0:41:11] <%Shonen_hero> check and mate
[0:41:13] <+UltraViolet371> This faction does have some Black Cauldron vibes, they should higher Nurgle for the inevitable remake
[0:41:13] <+queaks> That is what all the content creators are saying yeah
[0:41:17] <joodatious> they confirmed it befor
[0:41:17] <%blistexthief> Is it also tuned for lean?
[0:41:18] <%Brassnarwhal> @joshbored just started
[0:41:19] <bossbear> ULTRA
[0:41:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt multiplayer also uses ultra size now
[0:41:23] <%Brassnarwhal> couple minutes
[0:41:26] <+scarman125> yeah Ultra is what it's balanced off now
[0:41:28] <kazadaz> Can't change after you start a campaign
[0:41:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt think you have to restart to change unit size
[0:41:34] <+Squid5_> spells would still be nursed?
[0:41:36] <Soginha> yes, the damage of magic and single units is scaled
[0:41:36] <%Valdorick> Wait, we can change unit scale mid game now?
[0:41:40] <+Squid5_> nerfed*
[0:41:42] <Nikbottom> Throw heads
[0:41:43] <+Fetrigon> dude I work for SEGA Nigeria. It's true.

[0:42:58] <%Valdorick> Look, every Total War before this, its change unit size, you have to restart the entire campaign.
[0:43:00] <BliVru> NO. ANGERY :(
[0:43:02] <$scallycap> if chat doesnt calm down im going to kill myself you whores
[0:43:03] <$lotharrio> I'm only just starting to get ALL FIRED UP!
[0:43:04] <%hairtoday> i'll calm down when i'm dead
[0:43:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> don't worry about it
[0:43:05] <%AncelDeLambert> what is this unit size thing, why is it important
[0:43:07] <kazadaz> We didn't get one-guyed, the game really works like that
[0:43:11] <%Brassnarwhal> @mrtanaka111 oneguy detected
[0:43:12] <+rycon88> Let’s relax we are the happy bois
[0:43:16] <$ArcanumArcanum> @strakillias see that's cool for new people but I'm already invested on steam with all the previous games and DLC so they already hooked me into buying it
[0:43:17] <joodatious> @Valdorick literally untrue
[0:43:28] <%Valdorick> How so?
[0:43:30] <Yomamma1337> always play out the first battle.  for good luck
[0:43:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't forget to check out your plagues and techs
[0:43:33] <+Marsantas> Cause the AI is better than you
[0:43:34] <joodatious> @AncelDeLambert it changes the number of units
[0:43:36] <sirtommygunn> ogres strong
[0:43:36] <%radda343> that fat evil is very corpulent
[0:43:36] <thepardack> this man is leaving a poo streak on the ground
[0:43:37] <mrtanaka111> @Brassnarwhal i was never in hiding
[0:43:37] <%Monkeyweed21> Ogres are big bois
[0:43:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Valdorick but it was true tho
[0:43:43] <%Joshbored> @AncelDeLambert how many dudes in a squad, it affects the balance but turning it down saves cpu
[0:43:43] <bossbear> ogre booties are THICK
[0:43:47] <%Bluwizard21> ha bingowings
[0:43:47] <+JupiterDjin> big ogres take his nerd lunch monies
[0:43:49] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Auto resolve is a liar
[0:43:51] <person181> they wouldn't get beat up if they weren't nerds
[0:43:51] <CatRidder> stop losing then
[0:43:51] <+queaks> Just make sure nurglings are the ones getting beat up. They are the tarpit
[0:43:51] <crimsonsaens> Did you shoot him with your lord?
[0:43:53] <$ArcanumArcanum> but units heal over time
[0:44:03] <+rafaelba93> I would say to pile on them
[0:44:04] <Saturni_Rose> heywoaBIG
[0:44:06] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat make sure to check you plague. He may be lonely on the farm
[0:44:09] <+TheAdMerlin> Must hard to let your units get beat up and run away. This message brought you to by the Vampire factions
[0:44:11] <%AncelDeLambert> ... oh I would HATE this game, wow
[0:44:13] <%Man_in_the_Red> most noticably, magic is more powerful the less unit size is
[0:44:16] <%Brassnarwhal> @mrtanaka111 detected doesnt imply hiding just that everyone else didnt know you were there, i didnt find you you were detected
[0:44:17] <%kyh9> So make sure they don’t get beat up, ez
[0:44:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt autoresolve hates you way more in this game
[0:44:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Remember your nurglings are fodder meat to take blows for the rest of your foces
[0:44:30] <%Monkeyweed21> I love that corruption alters map details like those pus sacks
[0:44:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Ogres have a lovely culture
[0:44:31] <sirtommygunn> The enemies all melee, you should at least shoot them a bit with the flies
[0:44:34] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt If you hold space bar, you get more ui options
[0:44:35] <kazadaz> ZOOM IN ON THEM NURGLINGS
[0:44:39] <joodatious> a new feature is that the game saves your formations
[0:44:44] <huskarl_zap> yes
[0:44:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> I wish I was good at RTS games because the Total War games just look rad
[0:44:48] <kazadaz> Expendable
[0:44:51] <crimsonsaens> expendable?
[0:44:51] <joodatious> they aren't fodder
[0:44:51] <%Valdorick> Expendable
[0:44:52] <pokketlint60> Expendable?
[0:44:53] <tanarath> Y E S, they are fodder
[0:44:53] <$ArcanumArcanum> look at the circles in abilities?
[0:44:54] <$valkuma> Expendable
[0:44:55] <+queaks> Yeah you get about 10x more of them than any other unit
[0:44:57] <quantras6> @patstaresat it would say expendable
[0:44:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> traits are VERY inconsistent
[0:44:58] <$MattyNezz> That just affects morale
[0:44:59] <bippityjones> Show us those horrible gobulins
[0:45:00] <joodatious> Kugath makes them strong
[0:45:00] <sirtommygunn> They are fodder but they're surprisingly good fodder
[0:45:01] <Tunamanguy> they usually are
[0:45:01] <bippityjones> aww yeah
[0:45:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> @ReallyBigRocks SAME
[0:45:02] <mrtanaka111> @Brassnarwhal the more i learn
[0:45:02] <+rafaelba93> they are fodder alright
[0:45:02] <BliVru> Everything that is cheap is fodder
[0:45:03] <+p4ntless> nurglings are good for EVERYTHING
[0:45:04] <Nikbottom> Toads are cool
[0:45:05] <kazadog> expendable just means they dont cause leadership issues when the get killed
[0:45:05] <bourgeoisdaemon> Don't give too much weight to those notes
[0:45:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> every nurgling matters
[0:45:07] <%Brassnarwhal> zergling nurgling LUL
[0:45:07] <%SpontaneousC> Expendable just means you wont take moral damage if they die
[0:45:08] <%BinaryFireball> nerglings are usually a trash unit
[0:45:10] <pokketlint60> Nurgle would never treat his Daemons as expendable because he loves them all!
[0:45:10] <%king_wragles> Cute? They're actively shitting on each other
[0:45:11] <Soginha> they are easily replaceable, and can be decent with lord skills
[0:45:11] <%Valdorick> Just because they don't have that trait, doesn't mean their job isn't to die in droves for the damage dealers/
[0:45:14] <+Totally_Not_Toby> they're having a good time
[0:45:14] <bippityjones> They try
[0:45:14] <+Double_negative> This lord buffs Nurglings sky high, you want to buy lots of them and get all the nurgling skills in the lords skill tree
[0:45:14] <TrollKing96> How would a Total Warhammer 40K game work since space and other planets are a thing?
[0:45:15] <%SpontaneousC> Fodder can be fodder without that traight
[0:45:15] <+froduck42> They're cheap and you can get a lot of them easily
[0:45:17] <%Man_in_the_Red> Nurglings are kinda horrifying because they are good
[0:45:17] <Saturni_Rose> @ReallyBigRocks use time pause to cue up orders. that's what I did
[0:45:17] <%oda_flobunaga> @ReallyBigRocks try BSG deadlock, its a great entry RTS
[0:45:18] <%Monkeyweed21> nurglings are free you have basically infinite of them
[0:45:20] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> its expendable as fuck
[0:45:20] <%MonsterEnvy> They don't have that but they are meant to take blows for everyone else
[0:45:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> NLM chat come on
[0:45:25] <%twistedj3ster> I keeping thinking of Garfield except the grey one is Nermal but it's screwing with me
[0:45:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt cheap+high numbers means fodder, expendable is a bonus some fodder gets
[0:45:30] <+queaks> They look like they dont know why they are here
[0:45:30] <quantras6> @patstaresat if a units expendable it means nobody gets demoralised when they retreat
[0:45:30] <Grave_Titan_D> they're just having a good time
[0:45:32] <dredgyboi> Nurgle best god
[0:45:32] <$realm_forge> Look at em raving
[0:45:35] <Pookiedaexzile> Imagine being a dude with a  sword and you see this shit over the hill
[0:45:38] <CatRidder> the game needs a gieff unit
[0:45:39] <%CalderGaming> stinky boys
[0:45:39] <%Man_in_the_Red> theyre supposed to be fodder units but they wreck house with a small tech upgrade
[0:45:39] <Nikbottom> Having a great time
[0:45:40] <%Valdorick> @TrollKing96 The Map teleport zones from Empire Total War
[0:45:40] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Gamer chair
[0:45:41] <eustine> Chaos?
[0:45:42] <%radda343> very fat, very evil
[0:45:43] <$MattyNezz> Expandable just exists for SUPER shitty fodder like Skaven Slaves, so they don't tank your army morale when they get deleted in two seconds
[0:45:44] <$ArcanumArcanum> @TrollKing96 they would have to have the campaign on a single planet or massively overhaul the campaign map to make it work IMO
[0:45:46] <+gruff_gridof> greatest uncleanest
[0:45:50] <+Catpurnicus> does every unit have a fart-cloud radius or something?
[0:45:51] <joodatious> @TrollKing96 probably like dawn of war with planets being cities
[0:45:53] <count_bob> The gamercube.
[0:45:55] <%hairtoday> harbos
[0:45:55] <sirtommygunn> They're so cool! *vomits*
[0:45:56] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt I thought you hated gross body stuff
[0:45:58] <ohno58> Just shoot disinfectant at them
[0:45:59] <+p4ntless> all the other chaos gods just want to use you, nurgle loves you and wants you to have a good day
[0:46:02] <JackalKing> @TrollKing96 Do what the Dawn of War titles did and set it around the war for a single planet.
[0:46:15] <kazadaz> That's part of the thrill
[0:46:22] <joodatious> attack others with your mind goblins
[0:46:24] <%MonsterEnvy> Nurglings are supposed to take the first hit.
[0:46:27] <person181> he's using his goblins against them
[0:46:28] <+alphonseisbest> HE SPREADS HIS FEAR
[0:46:28] <+Sleepy_Puma> Whoa the great unclean one?
[0:46:31] <%notsoy> btw locking formation is only for regulating movement, guard stance is what makes missile units not chase when shooting
[0:46:32] <+Mrbaconator> so if pat could play as a hobo with a mystery syringe as a weapon would he?
[0:46:32] <Pookiedaexzile> I'm rooting for the Ogres
[0:46:33] <%vaporousTippler> It's like Batman being afraid of bats. ...except gross.
[0:46:34] <%MonsterEnvy> Then everyone else runs into them
[0:46:39] <%Cozy90> Pat they are hot what are you talking about?
[0:46:39] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat will master the monussy
[0:46:40] <+alphonseisbest> Weaponise your own fears CHAT
[0:46:40] <ReaverbotJesus> Pat doesn't want to see body horror, pat wants to be the body horror.
[0:46:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt numerous warbeasts are for harassing, Toads are like shock cavalry
[0:46:43] <Visorak6> the LORD
[0:46:46] <dredgyboi> is there any army in warhammer that doesnt devolve into gross body stuff?
[0:46:48] <%Valdorick> Pat doesn't want to be attacked by a mystery syringe, but that doesn't mean he's not using one on someone else if he founds one!
[0:46:49] <%Brassnarwhal> it's like how the ocean terrifies me so my favorite horror stories are about the ocean
[0:46:50] <pokketlint60> the virgin goblins vs. the chad gnoblars
[0:47:02] <$realm_forge> Weaponize that which you fear
[0:47:04] <%Man_in_the_Red> @reaverbotjesus no we wants to become an immortal toilet, just like the Mechanicus
[0:47:12] <%oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt all of Nergal's forces squeeze their colostomy bags in the general direction of their foes
[0:47:12] <+Sleepy_Puma> lmaooo
[0:47:12] <%MonsterEnvy> Did you hold alt
[0:47:13] <%Valdorick> Take Kugath out
[0:47:14] <Soginha> click the lock
[0:47:14] <+bytex678> I've never understood the "war" part of these games. At all.
[0:47:15] <+Sleepy_Puma> death blolb
[0:47:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> Ku'gath is anti-infantry, he does bad against large
[0:47:17] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Lokk at the projectile, its hilarious
[0:47:17] <%Man_in_the_Red> Flesh is Weak
[0:47:18] <+queaks> pat just click each unit and right click each enemy
[0:47:20] <kazadaz> Gotta select the WHOLE formation, you only had the boys selected
[0:47:22] <+p4ntless> they need to be in a locked group
[0:47:22] <CatRidder> restart
[0:47:23] <huskarl_zap> too little enemy units
[0:47:27] <Shacklebox> take the lord out
[0:47:28] <+StonerStan101> Sup Pat my fellow short dude.  How are things?
[0:47:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @man_in_the_red iron within
[0:47:33] <kazadaz> Cuase they got close
[0:47:34] <Shacklebox> got it!
[0:47:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> the smell
[0:47:34] <lloyddboy> too close
[0:47:35] <joodatious> they got close
[0:47:35] <%MonsterEnvy> They got close enough
[0:47:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> they got close enough to spot you
[0:47:37] <Azmodem> I see pat is playing as himself
[0:47:38] <bourgeoisdaemon> detection radius
[0:47:41] <Deleran> They probably smelled them.
[0:47:43] <%strakillias> They can see you if they get too close
[0:47:47] <+p4ntless> they got close enough to see you
[0:47:47] <%Valdorick> Did you have the crossed out eye icon over all of them?
[0:47:49] <Shacklebox> they got too close
[0:47:49] <joodatious> also they only have one way to go lol
[0:47:52] <%Brassnarwhal> They smell you
[0:47:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> i can smell a platoon of nurglings a mile away
[0:47:53] <+bytex678> cos they smell like farts
[0:47:54] <Pookiedaexzile> There's like five trees
[0:47:56] <bourgeoisdaemon> Do magic!
[0:48:19] <joodatious> FROGS
[0:48:21] <$realm_forge> The Nurglings we’re literally throwing a kegger in the woods
[0:48:28] <$scallycap> the toads love to eat infantry
[0:48:30] <person181> THEY HOP LIKE FROGS
[0:48:36] <+rycon88> @arcanumarcanum What about a total war 40k game set during the siege of vraks, plenty of factions appeared such as space marines and chaos marines and was a massive shitshow.
[0:48:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @person181 like toads
[0:48:46] <%notsoy> yes
[0:48:46] <Magicalquack> use hex on boss
[0:48:46] <Saturni_Rose> flnak
[0:48:50] <%Monkeyweed21> PANTS SHIT SPELL
[0:48:53] <bourgeoisdaemon> yeah there is friendly fire with magic
[0:48:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you can turn the spell by holding down the mouse button
[0:48:55] <kazadaz> You can hold down left-click to aim most spells
[0:48:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nergs smell like hot burning dog shit dipped in rot and sewage
[0:48:56] <%notsoy> a spell will specifically say if it does not do friendly fire
[0:48:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Miata of Mazdalence
[0:48:59] <Saturni_Rose> flank even
[0:49:04] <person181> @Brassnarwhal close enough
[0:49:05] <count_bob> They like it.
[0:49:06] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Remember you can hold the button to angle the spell
[0:49:07] <+TheAdMerlin> @PatStaresAt if you click a location then shift click another location, you can queue their movements
[0:49:14] <bourgeoisdaemon> Holding Ctrl allows you to twist the direction of a spell
[0:49:23] <%radda343> my brain doesn't understand rts games at all
[0:49:24] <%linSP> brapomancy?
[0:49:24] <$scallycap> those toads look just like humans! the resemblance is uncanny!
[0:49:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @person181 psaGotcha
[0:49:32] <joodatious> @rycon88 I mean that would be pretty disappointing considering the scale of the galaxy, 40k would end up feeling tiny to fantasy since it has all the races
[0:49:32] <kazadaz> @bourgeoisdaemon Don't have to hold CTRL even
[0:49:42] <raikagelord1> Can you play as a Khorne or a Slannesh faction?
[0:49:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @scallycap THEY LOOK JUST LIKE HUMAN BEINGS
[0:49:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @linsp basically
[0:49:52] <+itsgundamu> Lords are always tough
[0:49:56] <kazadog> nurgle in a nutshell
[0:49:56] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Pt u have guard mode on
[0:49:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Your Flyers are on Guard Mode so they won't chace
[0:49:59] <%Broand> oh no noigal
[0:50:01] <%MonsterEnvy> chase
[0:50:01] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Maybe dont have kugath firing explosive artilery at your own units
[0:50:02] <Pookiedaexzile> One Guy
[0:50:05] <some_douchebag69> froggie : )
[0:50:08] <%notsoy> that's nurgle's thing, tough as hell but slow and not very powerful
[0:50:08] <sirtommygunn> Nurgle doesn't deal much morale damage huh?
[0:50:12] <+scarman125> Kugath can hold his own in melee get him in there
[0:50:16] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nurgle can't really retreat, you're very slow
[0:50:17] <Saturni_Rose> leaders are like that
[0:50:18] <joodatious> no its fine
[0:50:20] <ElenaManetta> their life for the king
[0:50:26] <joodatious> don't listen to them pat
[0:50:28] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Kugath is good at big blobs but bad at hurting big single dudes
[0:50:30] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> you have auto guard mode in your settings so nothing with chase unless you deactivate ut
[0:50:30] <+itsgundamu> yea I keep forgettign friendly fire is a thing
[0:50:32] <+FanServ> it can sometimes be fine, depends on the projectile type
[0:50:32] <+Sleepy_Puma> goo man
[0:50:35] <joodatious> friendly fire is called friendly for a reason
[0:50:36] <sirtommygunn> It's fine if its nurglings
[0:50:36] <tanarath> 'What is friendly fire'
[0:50:37] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Kugath is actually really good in melee and can shoot while moving
[0:50:39] <Latija> how did i know pat would pick nurgle
[0:50:41] <BliVru> No one is chasing units cuz you have guard moe on
[0:50:42] <%Cozy90> Pat when u cpsplay this guy?
[0:50:43] <%Brassnarwhal> what if we all backseat pat  at the same time like as a prank
[0:50:45] <blackbaron98> WWWW
[0:50:49] <ElenaManetta> didn't lose a single guy, perfect
[0:50:53] <%Logoth_> VICTOLY
[0:50:53] <CatRidder> gud jobb
[0:50:53] <Saturni_Rose> Pat you're not playing Skaven, so friendly fire isn't good
[0:50:57] <Shacklebox> pause and look at the projectile, it's pretty cool looking
[0:51:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt kugath does way better against numerous small enemies than against ogres/cavalry/monsters
[0:51:06] <%Dakuu75> Chat... ffs...
[0:51:06] <%KineticZen> That guy's name is bingo wings, har
[0:51:07] <%epide> but we already do
[0:51:09] <kazadaz> So Pat, you ended your Grom stream with a meal, how will you end your Nurgle stream?
[0:51:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL Kappa
[0:51:10] <%Valdorick> What if we back seated him wrong, as a joke?
[0:51:11] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat do the thing good
[0:51:11] <BliVru> HE'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING
[0:51:12] <person181> that's a prank we're REALLY, REALLY GOOD at
[0:51:14] <Treasure_Vault> how would he tell
[0:51:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat you gotta flurgle ur nurgles
[0:51:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Cozy90 ...you mean he isn't?!

[0:51:20] <sirtommygunn> how unusual
[0:51:21] <%Brassnarwhal> i was being sarcastic pat
[0:51:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Use a Flanking maneuver
[0:51:23] <%Monkeyweed21> LOL 90% of pats losses were from friendly fire
[0:51:26] <@Ranryu692> do you want emote mode on?
[0:51:27] <%Brassnarwhal> please no
[0:51:27] <%Pappajimbo> yep
[0:51:28] <%ArceusStarDestroyer> you have auto guard mode in your settings so nothing with chase unless you deactivate it
[0:51:28] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Quick thing pat your flyers were on Guard Mode so that's why they did not chase the fleeing ogres

[0:52:21] <Treasure_Vault> i love a good plague
[0:52:22] <%Valdorick> Pat is playing COVID19
[0:52:22] <%thebeargoesHONK> i wanted to see goblins
[0:52:22] <%NopeBadguy> this hits a bit too close to home monkaS
[0:52:31] <Pookiedaexzile> How stank must that chair be
[0:52:32] <St33l_Titan> oh you have *no* idea how toxic the warhammer community is Pat, they'll probably rip me apart just for this comment Kappa
[0:52:32] <+Catpurnicus> *Omicron music plays*
[0:52:34] <%Cozy90> Hero is a term thats a bit loose here
[0:52:34] <+queaks> I feel like they took out the ability to name plagues so people dont call it Covid 19
[0:52:39] <pokketlint60> CROSS COUNTER
[0:52:46] <+penjaza> Nice meat balloon
[0:52:48] <joodatious> i love that all daemon factions have unique corruption on the map
[0:52:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @st33l_titan how dare you
[0:52:54] <%Cozy90> WHAT A HERO
[0:52:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> @St33l_Titan no u
[0:53:01] <Visorak6> You can describe nurgle units easily: "He's having a great time"
[0:53:04] <%Cozy90> SO NOBLE THIS HERO
[0:53:09] <+rycon88> @joodatious Maybe but the old dawn of war games tend to be set on either a single planet or a small system with a couple of planets, for a siege of vraks you would have plenty of options for factions, a clear objective, and would a decent start to explore and experiment with a radically new setting.
[0:53:13] <%Valdorick> Man, if ever there was a series that would work on the pre-recorded format, this is one of those series.
[0:53:13] <TheGoodTimeGirl> is that gramps from xenoblade 2
[0:53:13] <%Broand> Nurgle is so gross
[0:53:13] <%RonaldMcDownload> e n g o r g e
[0:53:14] <pokketlint60> @St33l_Titan THAT ISN'T TRUE HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT I'M GONNA RIP YOU APART
[0:53:20] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Your units are on default guard mode so they won't chase after fleeing units
[0:53:21] <+gruff_gridof> 'ard boyz
[0:53:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> it's actually super small
[0:53:26] <kazadaz> Patrick, you ended your Grom stream with a meal; how do you plan to end your Nurgle stream?
[0:53:29] <$realm_forge> ENGORGE IT
[0:53:29] <%Brassnarwhal> @visorak6 well they can't feel pain which is pretty cool
[0:53:33] <joodatious> big boys
[0:53:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Visorak6 Nergs like orks are just having a wonderful time
[0:53:39] <Latija> those hero abilities stack btw
[0:53:46] <+queaks> Infect Kugath
[0:53:55] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurgle has recruitment from a different Total War game
[0:54:03] <pokketlint60> #GreenBoys
[0:54:03] <ReaverbotJesus> Slug dogs!
[0:54:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nurgle grows units, so you have unit caps
[0:54:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @kazadaz by contracting a plague
[0:54:13] <+rycon88> Who’s smells worse orks or nurglings?
[0:54:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> plagues are the cauldron button with the exclamation point above the End Turn button @PatStaresAt
[0:54:19] <Yrefe> papa nurgle provides
[0:54:25] <Latija> pretty good
[0:54:25] <klx5> there's a select race option if you just wanna see nurgle
[0:54:30] <joodatious> unit summoning is awesome
[0:54:31] <%Bluwizard21> I'll never be your beast of nurgle
[0:54:31] <+OmegaWeltall> oh of course Pat's playing Papa Nurgle
[0:54:33] <kazadaz> The Beast is like a monster duellist I think
[0:54:36] <Visorak6> soul grinders are sick
[0:54:37] <%Pappajimbo> nurgle gief
[0:54:51] <Shacklebox> gotta get grosser
[0:54:52] <joodatious> WOW all the races are ready to be put in
[0:54:54] <%Valdorick> Oh that's a neat menu
[0:54:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Have you seen the "Great clean one" model conversion
[0:55:02] <Latija> well yeah
[0:55:03] <%notsoy> all chaos races have lots of monsters
[0:55:07] <%Valdorick> Yeah, Demons LOVE monster spam.
[0:55:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurgle is about big slow bois
[0:55:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt some nice trivia, Nurgle uses the recruitment system from TW: Three Kingdoms
[0:55:18] <joodatious> yes
[0:55:19] <%strakillias> Nurgle's army is about being beefy and (literally) shitting on dudes
[0:55:21] <Latija> yes
[0:55:21] <%Monkeyweed21> MORE NURGLINGS
[0:55:21] <joodatious> happy boys
[0:55:23] <+queaks> Yeah Nurglings are cheeeap
[0:55:26] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nurglings are never bad, they're value for cash
[0:55:26] <joodatious> let the babies loose
[0:55:26] <kazadaz> Porque no los dos
[0:55:28] <%Treuan> I like big boy
[0:55:29] <BliVru> @doc_ock_rokc OH MY GOD WHY
[0:55:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Get a Beast and some Nurgles
[0:55:31] <Visorak6> MORE nurglings
[0:55:33] <%oda_flobunaga> Nergal Nuggets
[0:55:35] <tgarcia8> Nurgling spam
[0:55:38] <+p4ntless> if the question is more nurglings the answer is yes, always
[0:55:39] <pokketlint60> can never have too many nurglings
[0:55:40] <%Valdorick> Consider the 1500 bois
[0:55:40] <huskarl_zap> plague bearers
[0:55:40] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats not new
[0:55:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Nurglings are free and basically infinite
[0:55:42] <+RealThiele> the dripping goo is inevitable
[0:55:44] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nurgle recruits different
[0:55:44] <$lotharrio> A nurgling and a beast
[0:55:45] <Soginha> its unique to nurgle
[0:55:46] <%MonsterEnvy> Nurgle is weird
[0:55:47] <GarbageNirvana> Why do these guys keep making Zangief noises
[0:55:50] <%notsoy> nurgle's infrastructure and recruitment are very different from everybody else
[0:55:50] <+bunchaghosts> more like nerdlings hue hue hue
[0:55:50] <Yomamma1337> ?
[0:55:51] <joodatious> its new for pat guys
[0:55:53] <+queaks> Click recruit and find out
[0:55:56] <kazadaz> Gotta click RECRUIT to confirm
[0:55:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BliVru Because I like to make you specifically suffer
[0:55:57] <%Nekros4442> Nurgle uses horde recruitment. Same as beastmen and such
[0:55:59] <moodkilla115> Beast of Nurgle is a very good option, especially if youre fighting Ogres
[0:56:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurgle recruitment is from Thrones of Britannia @PatStaresAt
[0:56:00] <joodatious> you can summon immediatly with nurgle
[0:56:00] <kazadog> recruited instantly
[0:56:01] <@PrefectusCorgi> Its not new
[0:56:05] <%Valdorick> That's not new, that's the Vampire Unit summoning UI
[0:56:06] <bourgeoisdaemon> as many as you got ready
[0:56:07] <$scallycap> more
[0:56:07] <+queaks> Unlimited but they come in damaged
[0:56:09] <+p4ntless> MANY
[0:56:10] <+Marsantas> As many as you can afford, it's not new
[0:56:11] <%oda_flobunaga> Unit Training
[0:56:11] <+scynza> man, some people in my fc are on some hard copium that drk is the best tank in the game in ffxiv
[0:56:12] <+scarman125> welcome to nurgle
[0:56:14] <+Shoosler> 20 total
[0:56:18] <Shacklebox> ALL OF THEM
[0:56:19] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt the limit is above the unit cards at the top
[0:56:19] <+bytex678> warhammer nerds D:
[0:56:20] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt you summmon units right away but they don't start at full strength
[0:56:22] <%Man_in_the_Red> some factions get this instacook units
[0:56:22] <Shacklebox> but they start low health
[0:56:24] <+Derogue> yeh its one of nurgles features
[0:56:24] <$ArcanumArcanum> the number above the summon unit card is how many you can recruit of that unit
[0:56:24] <kazadaz> But they'll start damaged
[0:56:28] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt nurgle uses the Total War: Three Kingdoms recruitment, where they get recruited instantly but start off damaged
[0:56:28] <%Valdorick> Protoss the Units right into your army
[0:56:30] <tgarcia8> As many as the cap allows instantaneously but at half health
[0:56:35] <+queaks> Dont bankrupt yourself though
[0:56:36] <bourgeoisdaemon> Your guys grow at home over time, gotta keep growing em up to full
[0:56:37] <huskarl_zap> Tomb kings were the same
[0:56:39] <BliVru> You chose the most diferent faction to start with
[0:56:43] <%VioletHeart> @scynza It's the highest DPS tank so in high level content it *is* the best one.
[0:56:44] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt its a mechanic unique to nurgle
[0:56:47] <%strakillias> Now do 4 more
[0:56:51] <joodatious> THE BOIS
[0:56:53] <Shacklebox> just like the british
[0:56:55] <Visorak6> The boys are back in town
[0:56:58] <+StonerStan101> Perfect faction for Pat really.
[0:57:00] <Yomamma1337> tomb kings and vampires do the same thing
[0:57:07] <Nikbottom> Nergle just built different
[0:57:10] <%legendscar01> @patstaresat remember pat papa Nurgle loves you
[0:57:11] <$realm_forge> I love the idea of an apocalyptic tidal wave of nurglings being all happy
[0:57:11] <kazadaz> Oh you should try one of the Undead factions in 2, they get something similar
[0:57:16] <joodatious> Nurgle also gets LOTS of big heals
[0:57:16] <gespenst25> 'ere we go 'ere we go 'ere we go!
[0:57:16] <+queaks> Thats why you want lots of replenishment and Nurgle and dont feel bbad about taking damage as nurgle
[0:57:17] <CatRidder> kill them all pat
[0:57:18] <@PrefectusCorgi> @PatStaresAt Dont forget Lvl Lord
[0:57:23] <joodatious> they are the tank faction
[0:57:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't forget to check your city
[0:57:29] <+rafaelba93> dof nurglin arrived
[0:57:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can also combine damaged units if you dont want to wait for replenishment
[0:57:49] <@Ranryu692> that's a useful button
[0:57:50] <person181> who doesn't \
[0:57:52] <joodatious> FUCK SHORTIES
[0:57:52] <kazadog> oh no he hates pat
[0:57:55] <%Valdorick> That button won't always cushion your ass.
[0:57:56] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Theres a button in game that tells chat to back seat you?
[0:57:57] <%emperordread> Yeah! Dwarves suck
[0:57:59] <Latija> route marcher is good
[0:58:00] <+OmegaWeltall> hates Tzeench LUL
[0:58:02] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt But now you have no money to build stuff in your city
[0:58:02] <pokketlint60> Anti-Pat faction
[0:58:02] <%twistedj3ster> that button's taking OUR job!
[0:58:02] <%legendscar01> @patstaresat lore reason that's why
[0:58:05] <%Valdorick> Like if you have empty or upgradable buildings in town.
[0:58:05] <+Fetrigon> KomodoHype SICK!
[0:58:08] <moodkilla115> Furies are great for Nurgle. One of the few fast moving units in an army of fat slugs
[0:58:09] <%Nekros4442> route marcher isbapways first
[0:58:10] <ScreamLord> But Pat, how can you be a part of the Nurgle faction then?
[0:58:15] <%notsoy> usually you take route marcher first, then grab spells
[0:58:15] <pokketlint60> I hope Skarbrand gets "Hates Khorne"
[0:58:18] <+queaks> He starts with hates dwarfs lol
[0:58:25] <+Fetrigon> TPFufun saves me time.
[0:58:25] <+theuselessace> al;ways get route marcher first
[0:58:26] <%Valdorick> "DWARVEN BALLS ARE TOO BRASS FOR MY CROTCH ROT!" - Nurgle, maybe
[0:58:28] <+theuselessace> no matter what
[0:58:30] <%Monkeyweed21> Dwarfs live super long and resist disease so Nurgle hates them
[0:58:34] <%GodDougle> GodDougle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 15 month streak!
[0:58:39] <+queaks> Theres always next turn
[0:58:40] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt also nurgle buildings are fuckin weird
[0:58:40] <%notsoy> lmao rekt
[0:58:44] <+Derogue> but you have beef
[0:58:46] <+rycon88> Why does he start with hates dwarfs?
[0:58:47] <$scallycap> just steal more money
[0:58:47] <+bunchaghosts> u can cancle them
[0:58:47] <kazadaz> Top row is Kugath's stats, second row is Kugath's spells, third is buffs to units in his army, fourth is buffs to his army overall
[0:58:49] <joodatious> its fine u got units already
[0:58:52] <CatRidder> restart the campain
[0:58:56] <$scallycap> everyones tree is weird
[0:58:56] <%Monkeyweed21> it happens when you're new you'll be fine
[0:59:01] <BliVru> you can combine units to fill their numbers
[0:59:03] <+Fetrigon> wow it's working already PogBones

[0:59:10] <+SpinalWizard> lol fleshy abundance
[0:59:11] <%Valdorick> Furries LUL
[0:59:14] <joodatious> all the daemon factions have unique tech trees that are all flavored for their faction
[0:59:14] <Nikbottom> NotLikeThis
[0:59:16] <pokketlint60> >Eastern Malady I'm not even touching that, it's too easy
[0:59:16] <Cobaltor_252> chaos furries...

[0:59:27] <+RealThiele> cysts yeyeye
[0:59:32] <+rycon88> You picked the most unique faction so……

[0:59:39] <+Squid5_> I can't wait for Mandalors crazy video for this game <3
[0:59:40] <+Derogue> fevers are good eco
[0:59:40] <CatRidder> negtussy

[0:59:43] <%Monkeyweed21> Growth is really good early
[0:59:44] <Latija> money
[0:59:56] <joodatious> ew
[0:59:57] <%Valdorick> @Pookiedaexzile If you have one, or know someone who has one, see a doctor
[0:59:59] <%strakillias> Fever or Cyst.
[1:00:00] <%Cozy90> everyone lost a good cyst
[1:00:01] <%Frodiddly> hell yeah i love growing cysts
[1:00:02] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Nurgle Buildings are interesting. They are expressive to first build, but upgrade on their own once built. Then they passively add units to your summoning pool.
[1:00:02] <%Cozy90> loves
[1:00:03] <%oda_flobunaga> Cyussy
[1:00:03] <%notsoy> growth and money are the most important things early
[1:00:03] <Visorak6> It means the building matures more often and faster
[1:00:07] <kazadog> not cyst growth but growth mechanic
[1:00:07] <kazadaz> It's a Building buff
[1:00:14] <%Frodiddly> cyussy baka
[1:00:17] <Shacklebox> buildings grow faster
[1:00:19] <%oda_flobunaga> Go for the cyussy

[1:01:20] <joodatious> the art for the plagues is so nice
[1:01:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> ahhh im covered in buboes
[1:01:23] <+xp194> @PatStaresAt Is Gripes a symptom?
[1:01:24] <%asgard147> Yo! You playin' the Grandfather Pat?
[1:01:27] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Its cheaper to summon plagues directly on Kugath btw
[1:01:27] <lloyddboy> ayy-g
[1:01:28] <kazadaz> Ague= Malaria
[1:01:34] <$realm_forge> Conquer the land in an endless tide of dysentery
[1:01:35] <%Blackmage9999> ah good old papa nurgle
[1:01:35] <$boggsz12> buboes, as in bubonic
[1:01:36] <TheLegendofNate> Kugoth still stirring that pot
[1:01:37] <%Brassnarwhal> that gives them those gross armpit bumps
[1:01:43] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Would you play the CO OP campaign on stream?
[1:01:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> ague lmao
[1:01:57] <joodatious> dont worry about it pat
[1:01:59] <CatRidder> summon elie
[1:02:05] <Pookiedaexzile> Kugussy
[1:02:05] <%notsoy> you can choose who to infect with your plague before clicking the plague menu
[1:02:05] <Yomamma1337> i assume you have to pick a location for the plague
[1:02:10] <%Brassnarwhal> there are so many mosquitoes send help
[1:02:11] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:02:11] <%linSP> without further ague
[1:02:11] <+pectusumbra> So I came in late and BOY I missed some stuff
[1:02:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt infect yourself and then spread the plague by fighting
[1:02:13] <+rycon88> Basically Grom cooking super cancer
[1:02:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat are you buboe dipping?
[1:02:16] <joodatious> guys pat is VERY new to warhammer games let him learn
[1:02:18] <ScreamLord> Realistically Nurgle would probably be the worst Chaos God too go against. Because 1: Nuglite demons are the most resilient and 2: Every Nurglite demons can infect you with some kind of horrible, crippling illness, some of which will turn you into a Nurglite demon
[1:02:19] <bourgeoisdaemon> better to click on kugath before infecting
[1:02:22] <%oda_flobunaga> Yum
[1:02:23] <Visorak6> It means infecting Kugath is cheaper @PatStaresAt
[1:02:28] <kazadaz> "Infect Selection" means it targets what you currently have highlighted (which in this case was your town).  You can target anything you own
[1:02:29] <%asgard147> nice limesEvil
[1:02:30] <+queaks> So if you select kugath to infect, its half price
[1:02:38] <klx5> it infects what you're targeting
[1:02:39] <dundore77> having kugoth selected before going into pox menu
[1:02:43] <%epide> what would nurgles wooty be like?
[1:02:47] <BliVru> put Kugath on the settlement for a few turns
[1:02:49] <+queaks> Yay gross!
[1:02:54] <joodatious> WOOH
[1:02:54] <blackbaron98> Ultra Dirt
[1:02:55] <kazadog> YAY STINKY
[1:02:59] <+RandyFistburgers> Big gross
[1:03:02] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt if you have a character move over to the settlement the plague can spread on it's own
[1:03:03] <%asgard147> eat the pus pat limesEvil
[1:03:06] <$lotharrio> Weeping buboes and everything.
[1:03:07] <+queaks> Uh oh stinkies

[1:03:11] <%oda_flobunaga> Equip colostomy Bag
[1:03:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt now you spread the plague to everyone you fight
[1:03:12] <pokketlint60> Lucha lookin' ass on the right

[1:03:21] <bourgeoisdaemon> hovering autoresolve shows if any units will get wiped
[1:03:23] <kazadaz> Just don't let those hypercavalry charge your infantry and you'll be okay
[1:03:24] <kazadog> fight it so we can see da ogres
[1:03:24] <+JupiterDjin> and medium casualties
[1:03:26] <Yomamma1337> "casualties medium"
[1:03:28] <%oda_flobunaga> Sorry, Colostussy bag
[1:03:29] <+rafaelba93> never worth it on this game
[1:03:29] <Shacklebox> lets see if pat can turn it pyrhic
[1:03:29] <dundore77> believe in your papa
[1:03:35] <rcand9> i like that dude in the top right
[1:03:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> you definitely will, autoresolve hates damaged units so it underrated you
[1:03:46] <$valkuma> @PatStaresAt the auto resolve should show you casualties
[1:03:47] <%asgard147> They tanky tho right?
[1:03:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Gnoblussy?
[1:03:50] <%Bluwizard21> gnoblar these nuts
[1:03:51] <pokketlint60> Mind Gnoblars = level 2 Mind Goblins
[1:03:52] <Yomamma1337> it says casualties next to the battle result
[1:03:54] <Latija> that mournfang cavalry can fuck you up
[1:03:58] <kazadaz> "Colostussy" is the worst one, it's the fucken worst, I thought I was inured to it by now
[1:04:00] <+queaks> No casualties
[1:04:06] <Yomamma1337> it says medium casualties
[1:04:07] <%king_wragles> I alt tabbed back in thinking Pat was making up names, sure enough... gnoblars
[1:04:07] <%notsoy> tzeentch is the only daemon faction that has significant amounts of ranged units
[1:04:09] <+SpinalWizard> This whole city went to shit when the gnoblars moved in
[1:04:09] <%SaiyanShoto> Gnoblar on deez nuts
[1:04:09] <Manwad> these are some fucking names
[1:04:09] <$realm_forge> NURG RUSH
[1:04:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt it only shows if a unit will be wiped out
[1:04:14] <dockingchamp> i had no idea they were making a total warhammer 3! just preordered it lol
[1:04:16] <Vex_Machina> Medium
[1:04:17] <thepardack> paul gnoblart

[1:04:18] <kazadog> gonna get some gnobussy
[1:04:22] <%MonsterEnvy> So lots of beat up units but no units lost
[1:04:27] <@PrefectusCorgi> Thats only for TWW2

[1:04:41] <+queaks> Put your healthy ones up front me thinks
[1:04:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> yeah
[1:04:47] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Don't feel, do
[1:04:49] <%Valdorick> Ogre in the Iron Mask
[1:04:49] <kazadog> most of the army is gnoblars youll be fine
[1:04:49] <+jsleeze> yep
[1:04:49] <%Brassnarwhal> short range thicc as fuck
[1:04:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Nergs are literally zerg
[1:04:53] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> not really, but the ones they do have are either big as fuck or gnoblars yeeting spears
[1:04:56] <$lotharrio> Gotta get close to sneeze on people.
[1:04:57] <%Broand> The disease cares not for a single germ
[1:04:57] <Magicalquack> surround them
[1:04:58] <%notsoy> probably not, half of the units are trash fodder and nurgle units are more durable than average in general
[1:04:58] <$valkuma> Yeah...you usually wanna take the autoresolve if it shows no casualties.
[1:04:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you got rated a decisive victory even when you had damaged units, you'll be fine. AR underrates dmaaged units
[1:05:02] <%vehementvadr> the legendary battle of glut port, one for the books
[1:05:03] <moodkilla115> FYI Furies are very good at taking down defensive towers!
[1:05:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> just give em the ick
[1:05:06] <%Valdorick> Minor Settlements are SO MUCH BETTER
[1:05:11] <%MyNameIsRasus> dope map wow
[1:05:12] <Magicalquack> attack from all sides you have the numbers
[1:05:14] <dundore77> Warhammer 3 settlements are much better
[1:05:15] <%MonsterEnvy> Nrugle corruption
[1:05:16] <%asgard147> as nugllites are want to do, as the Grandfather demands limesEvil
[1:05:18] <+queaks> Yeah they dont mind it
[1:05:18] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Ogres are hardy folk
[1:05:18] <%Valdorick> Free food for the Ogres
[1:05:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> y'all really live like this?
[1:05:20] <%notsoy> they took it from you before the campaign started
[1:05:20] <Visorak6> "Damn bitch you live like this?"
[1:05:20] <$ArcanumArcanum> bitch you live like this?
[1:05:22] <bippityjones> Maybe you being here just did this
[1:05:24] <pokketlint60> This is because of Nurgle corruption, it effects battle maps too now
[1:05:24] <joodatious> they eat the poop
[1:05:26] <%Chichen> bitch you live like this?
[1:05:26] <+Mrbaconator> pats really like "ogres you live like this"
[1:05:26] <bourgeoisdaemon> It's still in the Nurgle zone even if they occupy it
[1:05:27] <copyritetm> Ogres don't give a shit they'll eat anything
[1:05:27] <+froduck42> Damn Bitch you live like this?
[1:05:28] <ElenaManetta> they like it
[1:05:29] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt because you have a bunch of nurgle corruption in the area
[1:05:29] <kazadaz> Hit Start Deployment to make that prompt go away
[1:05:31] <Samurai_Jake> nurgle units are usually tanky but slow
[1:05:31] <Latija> damn bitch you live like this
[1:05:32] <%legendfather_of_giants> thats Nurgle's fault, not the ogres
[1:05:33] <Shacklebox> they got some fuckedup neighbors
[1:05:34] <%Bailey__Gaming> what army is Pat?
[1:05:35] <pokketlint60> Corruption changes battle maps now
[1:05:38] <%Monkeyweed21> you get more nurglings from every economy building so feel free to sacrifice them
[1:05:41] <dundore77> becuase the corruption for nurgle is high it changes the landscape same for all other gods as well
[1:05:43] <Yomamma1337> its your factions fault lol
[1:05:47] <Nikbottom> Foods food
[1:05:48] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can sorrund the whole map
[1:05:50] <slix3431> You're a wizard harry
[1:05:50] <huskarl_zap> Ogers have extreme resilliance
[1:05:50] <pokketlint60> "Yer a wizard, Counter"
[1:05:51] <joodatious> @Bailey__Gaming nurgle
[1:05:52] <kazadaz> A Fight-Wizard
[1:05:53] <+rycon88> They are pretty gross themselves
[1:05:54] <%MonsterEnvy> You don't have to go in this one area
[1:05:55] <$lotharrio> 'Ary?
[1:05:56] <%Valdorick> Chonk Wizard
[1:05:57] <Pookiedaexzile> He cast magic
[1:05:59] <%notsoy> yes, greater daemons are all spellcasters except for khorne
[1:06:01] <%SaiyanShoto> Yer a lizard Larry
[1:06:03] <dundore77> you have the full mape to deploy
[1:06:04] <%Monkeyweed21> All demon lords and heroes are wizards
[1:06:10] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt are you gonna play the CO OP campaigns on stream?
[1:06:16] <slix3431> Pat you gotta get nasty
[1:06:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @bailey__gaming i was trying to mention you not friend you, he's nurgle
[1:06:23] <%notsoy> khorne is the only exception to that rule, because khorne hates magic
[1:06:23] <thepardack> if you're a wizard you have to tell me
[1:06:23] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can deploy around the whole map not just this one area
[1:06:23] <+bytex678> Yes, chat, keep telling Pat how to play I'm sure he'll LOVE it :D
[1:06:24] <kazadaz> Cuddles
[1:06:24] <joodatious> @Monkeyweed21 no they aren't
[1:06:29] <%Monkeyweed21> the Nurglings are best as a front line
[1:06:30] <joodatious> he's a happy puppy
[1:06:33] <kazadog> hes so happy
[1:06:34] <$scallycap> i love he
[1:06:36] <$boggsz12> i love him
[1:06:37] <%Valdorick> He's so happy!
[1:06:37] <rcand9> hes real wiggly thats awesome
[1:06:38] <+Shoosler> Ursula?
[1:06:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> he loves being disgusting
[1:06:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:06:40] <joodatious> Its Gief
[1:06:43] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> let the man spread plagues however he wishes, for he is the great unclean orb
[1:06:44] <$realm_forge> Plage Pat is now running clinical trials
[1:06:45] <%Dakuu75> that's legit horrifying
[1:06:46] <quantras6> HE'S SO HAPPY IT'S GREAT
[1:06:48] <Visorak6> Just ate a nurgling oh no
[1:06:49] <DeltaPangaea> He's havin' a whale of a time.
[1:06:52] <thepardack> He's cool I like hi
[1:06:53] <$lotharrio> He's got a buddy crawling around inside of him!
[1:06:53] <quantras6> GRANDPA IS PROUD
[1:06:54] <%oda_flobunaga> dentatussy?
[1:06:55] <+BlackSunEmperor> I love him
[1:06:57] <$realm_forge> He’s having a great time
[1:07:00] <+demon1103> that's disgusting...I love it!!!
[1:07:05] <+SpinalWizard> He actually just wants to play
[1:07:06] <%cvp5127> psaDogchamp
[1:07:11] <%linSP> I’m eating!
[1:07:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Beasts of Nurgle are puppies that dont attack, they just aggresively cuddle people
[1:07:15] <%notsoy> the yellow area is your deployment zone
[1:07:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> full 360
[1:07:20] <%GinAndRoses> wheee kaptoored eet for kayos
[1:07:21] <BliVru> the yellow
[1:07:21] <%notsoy> the white area is where vanguard deployment can be done
[1:07:22] <kazadaz> Everything the light touches
[1:07:23] <kazadog> @PatStaresAt the units with the little red icon over their unit cards can be deployed in front of your deployment area up to the white line
[1:07:24] <Vex_Machina> Yellow.
[1:07:26] <%MonsterEnvy> It's the entire map
[1:07:27] <dundore77> its 360 on this map
[1:07:29] <%Brassnarwhal> it's like that episode of mr meaty with the tapeworm
[1:07:32] <Daxalog> all around
[1:07:33] <%Nekros4442> surround this binch
[1:07:33] <joodatious> everything behind yellow and vanguard units can go further
[1:07:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> spread your nurgs far and wide
[1:07:43] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Units with Vanguard Deployment can be puth inside the white zone
[1:07:47] <%MonsterEnvy> Anywhere on the map behind the yellow
[1:07:47] <ebrion> Ogres have dat good Gut Magic
[1:07:49] <+queaks> Spliting can be good, but probably harder to micro
[1:07:50] <%Brassnarwhal> OH GOD pat have you seen mr meaty? you would hate it
[1:07:59] <Daxalog> Its a good idea sometimes to split up your attack so they have to split their defense. iirc
[1:08:02] <%asgard147> Come here new friends! Let us bring you into the Grandfather's embrace! limesEvil limesKnife
[1:08:07] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Your formation isn't stinky enough
[1:08:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> its a pincer attack but it smells worse
[1:08:29] <thepardack> @Brassnarwhal That fact that at least one other person on planet earth remembers mr meaty somehow simultaneously shatters my reality and assures me that I'm not completely fucking insane
[1:08:30] <%Chex868> man its wierd there so much choas love in this game
[1:08:34] <Visorak6> Just get some more beasts of nurgle and you'll be plenty stinky
[1:08:37] <%strakillias> Nurgle units being the happiest fuckers in Warhammer and possibly the only ones who are happy, is the best.
[1:08:44] <slix3431> @ReallyBigRocks Sphincter attack
[1:08:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> mr meaty was some fucked shit
[1:08:55] <kazadaz> Nurgle believes ALL life is sacred
[1:09:02] <+SpinalWizard> @strakillias also orks
[1:09:04] <%shurtal> would Gief go Nuurgal or Khorne?
[1:09:06] <bourgeoisdaemon> Splitting up too much can strain your micromanagement
[1:09:10] <+Shoosler> that's a big ass map
[1:09:13] <joodatious> @strakillias ork are also happy. though warhammer fantasy is a decent amount of happy
[1:09:13] <Latija> good luck
[1:09:19] <%Bailey__Gaming> is this the fantasy or 40k warhammers?
[1:09:25] <+ReallyBigRocks> @slix3431 puts the pressure on from all sides
[1:09:30] <+rycon88> Remember the episode with the stomach worm
[1:09:30] <%MonsterEnvy> Fantasy
[1:09:30] <slix3431> @shurtal Geif is Ogre, cause he is of the fatness

[1:09:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @bailey__gaming fantasy
[1:09:53] <dundore77> no shame in pausing imo i do it all the time
[1:09:55] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Hit that PAUSE on 'em!
[1:10:03] <%Chex868> those poor gnoblars
[1:10:03] <%Bailey__Gaming> thanks, what army's can you be?
[1:10:06] <xerotwo> ZA WARUDO
[1:10:07] <+bytex678> 40K would have had giant mega space ships and unneccesarily huge pauldrons by now
[1:10:09] <+Romuken> We playing ogre bois?  Noic.  Orb team!
[1:10:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> "real time" strategy
[1:10:18] <moodkilla115> Capturing zones gives army wide buffs
[1:10:28] <%notsoy> btw both kugath and your hero should have spells, so don't forget to use those
[1:10:30] <SaltyAzteca> Youre good Pat :)
[1:10:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Bailey__Gaming all 4 chaos demons, Chaos Undivided, Kislev (Russia), Cathay (China) and Ogres
[1:10:35] <Pookiedaexzile> @Romuken Nurgle Nymphos

[1:10:51] <%asgard147> Here we come new friends! Let us show you Nurgle's lovely gifts! limesKnife
[1:10:57] <moodkilla115> Furies are great for downing towers
[1:10:59] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Fliers can kill towers fast
[1:11:09] <%MonsterEnvy> They apepared
[1:11:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> its a secret
[1:11:11] <bourgeoisdaemon> click the notification
[1:11:13] <joodatious> ogres melord
[1:11:15] <bippityjones> You can't see behind walls Pat
[1:11:16] <Pookiedaexzile> They're hiding
[1:11:37] <kazadaz> Nurgle infantry moves at HALF the speed of elves
[1:11:37] <%Bloomingzonda> @moodkilla115 Is that what paige does at furry conventions
[1:11:38] <%MonsterEnvy> Don't forget about slow mode
[1:11:39] <joodatious> they're scared
[1:11:42] <Visorak6> WHY are you running?
[1:11:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> archers are repositioning
[1:11:46] <+queaks> They scared gobbos
[1:11:46] <+poisin224> theyre baiting you
[1:11:47] <joodatious> coward gnoblars
[1:11:47] <rcand9> one units still asleep
[1:11:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> ranged units will run from melee
[1:11:49] <Latija> because they're cowards
[1:11:51] <%Bailey__Gaming> @legendfather_of_giants no brentionians? no undead? that sucks what if I don't like chaos?
[1:11:51] <+bytex678> Pat just told you guys to stop fuckin backseating and you're going on worse than ever :D
[1:11:54] <%maskofmichael> WHY ARE WE RUNNING?
[1:11:55] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz gnoblars suck
[1:11:58] <rcand9> its got the zzz
[1:12:03] <SaltyAzteca> mmm, pincer strikes
[1:12:11] <$lotharrio> Gnoblar sandwich?
[1:12:13] <%Nekros4442> @bailey__gaming then yoy wait a a couple months
[1:12:14] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Flank them Pat
[1:12:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Bailey__Gaming brets and undead are in Warhammer 1 (and 2 with Mortal Empires)
[1:12:16] <%asgard147> Don't run new freinds! We just want to hug you! limesEvil
[1:12:20] <%notsoy> nurgle is sloooooooooow
[1:12:20] <+SpinalWizard> "Why are you running?" Pat full on nurgle mode
[1:12:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no did you get baited :)
[1:12:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Bailey__Gaming They'll be added to 3 eventually, but you'll have to own 1 and 2 to play that mode
[1:12:50] <%Nekros4442> @bailey__gaming same thing happened when 2 released. Had to wait for mortal empires to be integrated
[1:12:53] <dundore77> you can turn auto guard mode on and off in the settings
[1:13:21] <kazadaz> That's a good matchup; the danger of their monster-cav is knockback, and your monsters can't get knockbacked
[1:13:23] <thepardack> get em froggies
[1:13:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> monsters can be anti-large themselves
[1:13:26] <+FanServ> monstrous units can be anti-monster, you can check on their unit card
[1:13:35] <%notsoy> there should be an option or button to automatically show a unit's stats when highlighting them, if that helps
[1:13:41] <%maskofmichael> I would never backseat play Pat. Mainly because I've never played one of these games an I have no idea what's he doing anyway
[1:13:48] <BliVru> @patstaresat Press I to check stats
[1:14:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Mournfang are FOR REAL
[1:14:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Someone show this to a Field Captain from the Bronze Age
[1:14:11] <SaltyAzteca> Run awaaaaaaay WutFace
[1:14:12] <Latija> kugath is on melee i think
[1:14:13] <+rycon88> Blood for the blood gods
[1:14:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> @notsoy there is, its not default tho
[1:14:23] <joodatious> they chonky
[1:14:28] <Visorak6> your beast is fine
[1:14:31] <+Romuken> Yo pat, with ranged units, if you have fire-at-will on while in melee, they'll still fire their range weapons.  Or should.  Might need to have their formation set so they're a rectangle, small end to the enemy for max efficiency?
[1:14:36] <Nikbottom> Help frogs
[1:14:40] <cloakofashes> Is Papa Pat-gle giving hugs to everyone?
[1:14:43] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt have you seen the Great Unclean One's special execution?
[1:14:44] <%Monkeyweed21> Monstrous cavalry are good at staying in the fight at the cost of lower speed
[1:14:47] <+Romuken> Also YAY FROGS
[1:14:54] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Pat I just wanna say you are doing awesome
[1:14:56] <kazadaz> Yah the frogs are winning, just slowly
[1:14:59] <slix3431> @PatStaresAt Crowding single units is less effective than duelling
[1:15:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> The Gross Bug Cavalry is here to Help Frogs!
[1:15:02] <+bytex678> oh god the backseaters are yelling in highlights now
[1:15:04] <%Gogogolem> Pat why do you love playing smelly people in video games.
[1:15:04] <+Romuken> @PatStaresAt did the frogs drink the water?
[1:15:12] <%asgard147> Can you feel Grandfather's love yet new freinds? Isn't it wonderful? limesEvil
[1:15:12] <SaltyAzteca> THE EAGLES
[1:15:14] <+rycon88> Your doing fine
[1:15:36] <%Bloomingzonda> Pat is the most beautiful frog lord I have ever seen
[1:15:40] <+Romuken> delicious
[1:15:41] <+queaks> I think you can hold space to see unit outlines
[1:15:41] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Fun fact about the Beast the Beasts turn into the Flies when they get too depressed
[1:15:50] <%Monkeyweed21> PANTS SHIT SPELL YEA
[1:16:04] <moodkilla115> Ku Gath is tank as fuck, but your other stinky boi not so much
[1:16:06] <Yomamma1337> chase?
[1:16:07] <dundore77> you have guard mode on
[1:16:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you have Guard Mode on, units won't chase after fleeing enemies
[1:16:16] <dundore77> in guard mode they wont chase
[1:16:16] <joodatious> cant wait for pat to see the giant shits GUOs do
[1:16:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Gueard Mode
[1:16:30] <Yomamma1337> gotta be careful of friendly fire
[1:16:30] <%notsoy> the birds are shit, don't worry about them
[1:16:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> don worry the furies SUCK
[1:16:32] <+poisin224> F
[1:16:32] <+Buttlo> atpBird
[1:16:32] <pokketlint60> It's ok Pat you can get more birds
[1:16:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Furies
[1:16:34] <+queaks> Birds are cheap feel nothing for their loss
[1:16:36] <joodatious> its alright we'll get more
[1:16:36] <Magicalquack> dont worry they are crap
[1:16:37] <+rycon88> You have guard mode on so they won’t really pursue
[1:16:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> fuck dem birds
[1:16:38] <bourgeoisdaemon> Better off without them!
[1:16:39] <%hairtoday> it's cool, furies are shitters
[1:16:41] <dundore77> furies die super easy
[1:16:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Birds are cheap tier 1 units
[1:16:45] <moodkilla115> Easily replaceable
[1:16:46] <tanarath> Did friendly fire do it?
[1:16:49] <crimsonsaens> birds have glass bones
[1:16:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Your Furies
[1:16:53] <+Romuken> They got hollow bones like Paige.  Never stood a chance @PatStaresAt
[1:16:56] <%XzileGaming> anti birb tech
[1:16:59] <Latija> there's a setting to have guard mode off automatically
[1:17:00] <Yomamma1337> they suck and you had ranged units pointed at them i imagine
[1:17:07] <%notsoy> guard mode should only be on for non-cavalry missile units
[1:17:08] <+rycon88> They suck that’s why
[1:17:08] <dundore77> you can make it so you have to toggle guard mode instead of it being auto on in the settings
[1:17:13] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Theres a setting to have guard mode off by default
[1:17:14] <$lotharrio> Pat's lord sounds like he's gargling.
[1:17:20] <cloakofashes> The birds apparently made the mistake of looking delicious near the ogres?
[1:17:21] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt That is an option
[1:17:27] <%Valdorick> Guard mode is GREAT for ranged units you want behind your lines.
[1:17:31] <%MonsterEnvy> You can select auto on or off
[1:17:32] <Nikbottom> Man this fight is gross
[1:17:39] <%Valdorick> Did you?
[1:17:43] <joodatious> you you press Ctrl+A you can mass select the whole army
[1:17:46] <+Romuken> yum so gross
[1:17:46] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Your army ability is charged
[1:17:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> guard mode is good for archers/artillery
[1:18:01] <moodkilla115> Guard mode is cool if youre on the defense
[1:18:01] <SaltyAzteca> The bigger the beast....the greater the glory....
[1:18:02] <+Romuken> How's he liking that dank nasty Nurgussy
[1:18:05] <+dragoon001914> Damn, why does the game have to be a week away?  I wanna play Cathay :(

[1:21:25] <+Fetrigon> none :)
[1:21:27] <%MonsterEnvy> Minus the one you are covering up
[1:21:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Furies are meant to die tying up artillery and ranged units while you shamble up to them

[1:26:52] <kazadaz> He starts with all his skills; points just make him better
[1:26:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they have all those skills, they use them in different circumstances
[1:27:02] <+Rofiarf> will you use him for combat or not?
[1:27:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> Between him and Kugath one should spellcast and the other should fight
[1:27:06] <%MonsterEnvy> All the skills he has he already has
[1:27:17] <tgarcia8> Magic is best
[1:27:18] <dundore77> that bottom row are all the actions he can do and on general buff
[1:27:18] <orochiblood> just joined and Pat picked Nurgle, lmao
[1:27:18] <%notsoy> the points at the bottom are to improve those abilities/effects
[1:27:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> for the bottom stuff @PatStaresAt

[1:27:39] <%MonsterEnvy> like training
[1:27:42] <+queaks> Id make him the mage and make Kugath a leader
[1:27:45] <+bytex678> The innards of a Great Unclean One are best not pondered, for such gastric caverns are not places that sane men wish to consider for too long. It is in these churning depths that the Nurglings are created.
[1:27:46] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh ok

[1:32:20] <Latija> yay!
[1:32:22] <+A_Fistful_of_Bees> Local Ginger Man spreads his shit everywhere
[1:32:23] <%strakillias> mustering=recruitment
[1:32:25] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So is this game closer to Civ than Starcraft or 4X?
[1:32:28] <%notsoy> lmao 20? that's definitely very long-term
[1:32:31] <%Sotetsu> I know Paige likes mustarding
[1:32:36] <Pookiedaexzile> Nurgle doesn't believe the numbers
[1:32:41] <Visorak6> 20 is a new army
[1:32:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> furies are VERY bad
[1:32:48] <$Cthulos> Total War War
[1:32:50] <$Cthulos> Hammer
[1:32:52] <%Brassnarwhal> your army is SICK!
[1:32:57] <$realm_forge> Your army is afflicted with Chilibutt
[1:32:58] <%strakillias> Toad it up
[1:32:59] <tgarcia8> Furies are not worth it
[1:33:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> one of the worst units
[1:33:05] <%MonsterEnvy> Furies are useful
[1:33:06] <%notsoy> yeah, furies only exist to be a cheap fast meatshield
[1:33:06] <%Monkeyweed21> MORE NURGLINGS
[1:33:07] <@QueequegTheater> Total Total War War Hammer Hammer
[1:33:10] <kazadaz> Flying units tend to be Trash or Elite, no in-between
[1:33:10] <%Valdorick> Furies are BORN TO DIE
[1:33:12] <theoneGalen> what the heck chaos hell is this?
[1:33:25] <+queaks> Nurglings are economic
[1:33:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @pookiedaexzile nurgle made the virus and hes the one telling people masks will make you pass out or whatever
[1:33:27] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Your buildings will fill the summoning pool with units
[1:33:29] <%SpontaneousC> Early fliers are really for tying up other units or harrasing archers, they're not really expected to live long
[1:33:31] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt furies are for tying up artillery and ranged so they dont kill your good units
[1:33:35] <%MonsterEnvy> The numbers are how many you have
[1:33:35] <$lotharrio> Pat's a scientist!
[1:33:38] <+poisin224> seduced by the price point yet again
[1:33:43] <%Chex868> murglings are goblin eqivolent
[1:33:47] <%Bloomingzonda> Oh cool you poop on the ground
[1:33:49] <+ryderbootz> Ogres delende est
[1:33:57] <dundore77> and kugath does get stuff that ups nerglings
[1:34:02] <%Sotetsu> Eww, that army makes more slime than Gief does.
[1:34:06] <kazadaz> Cheap units are the best, you can beat Shogun 2 with nothing but Ashigaru
[1:34:12] <Anarbael> Kugath gets an ability later on that lets you heal nurglings passively battle
[1:34:25] <+queaks> Hes preparing a defence
[1:34:25] <dundore77> if you press r it speeds up the walking speed
[1:34:26] <%notsoy> nothing in this game is quite as good as S2 yari ashigaru lol
[1:34:27] <%Brassnarwhal> is it normal for the autosave to take so long?
[1:34:30] <vonmaultke> Pat playing Granddad's Orbs faction? Nice FeelsGoodMan
[1:34:34] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt All this does is make me want a remake of Dark Crusade
[1:34:36] <%Chex868> ogre big troops small numbers
[1:34:52] <%That1blindkid> That1blindkid subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months, currently on a 9 month streak! Uwuw Papa Nurgle gives the good touch
[1:35:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Spread that Decussy
[1:35:14] <+queaks> How sick the land is
[1:35:18] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Especially among Gripes
[1:35:20] <Latija> corruption is a spectrum
[1:35:21] <%strakillias> Spread a gripe
[1:35:21] <@QueequegTheater> Chaos juice
[1:35:22] <stormhawk9891> Spread those gripes
[1:35:22] <%Monkeyweed21> your zerg carpet
[1:35:25] <alwayspronking> do it again for the lulz
[1:35:26] <thepardack> spread mooooore!
[1:35:26] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> spread MORE
[1:35:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes, corruption is a passive effect spread by osmosis, having heroes there, etc @PatStaresAt
[1:35:31] <dundore77> yeah thatll spread
[1:35:31] <Latija> yes
[1:35:37] <%notsoy> yeah, corruption basically spreads by itself
[1:35:37] <%maskofmichael> spread the plague of gripes
[1:35:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt corruption is creep
[1:35:39] <huskarl_zap> yes usually
[1:35:39] <moodkilla115> you do it passively
[1:35:41] <+queaks> Oh look its pats couch
[1:35:41] <alwayspronking> maybe there's a stance that helps?
[1:35:42] <plaguedoctor_vi> yes
[1:35:47] <SaltyAzteca> GO! GO! CORRUPTION!
[1:35:47] <%cvp5127> tags: corruption
[1:35:48] <darkodargon> any hero in the area just does it
[1:35:49] <%Man_in_the_Red> you can recurit heroes that spread it more
[1:35:51] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt buildings heroes and armies will passively increase it
[1:35:51] <vonmaultke> Letting your funk woft into the next region
[1:35:53] <DeltaPangaea> Just gotta exist grossly.
[1:35:55] <%notsoy> an area with very high corruption will start to spread it to neighboring areas
[1:35:59] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah and techs and units and buildings will spread it more
[1:36:04] <dundore77> theres also probably buildings or agent skillsthat up spread
[1:36:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt You have to move Arthas to the waypoint
[1:36:07] <kazadaz> You can get corruption from buildings, characters (w skills), and plagues
[1:36:07] <%Nekros4442> you may have an army stance that affects it
[1:36:07] <plaguedoctor_vi> some characters help spead corroption like a cultis of nurgle
[1:36:10] <%sandrews> hows pat doin?
[1:36:11] <+poisin224> corruption is like religion in the old TW games except it can cause attrition
[1:36:25] <+JupiterDjin> run like big boy
[1:36:27] <Magicalquack> should have taken the town
[1:36:29] <orochiblood> Im gonna wait for the Blood DLC to play Khorne. Its weird without blood.
[1:36:33] <person181> yay gross house
[1:36:44] <+SpinalWizard> Gross ER
[1:36:49] <Profmcstevie> FILTH....EXPANDS
[1:37:00] <%Sotetsu> This doesn't come out for normal people until next Thursday, right?
[1:37:03] <bippityjones> I want to see the maps from Warhammer Age of Reckoning in this game
[1:37:03] <ahaegotrigger> HOT
[1:37:08] <kazadaz> Those Nurglings are tough as hell
[1:37:13] <%QuasarKnightGaming> The ring is not equipped
[1:37:18] <vonmaultke> Sexy boi
[1:37:19] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Oop nevermind
[1:37:22] <%FunkyStreams> he seems... hungry?
[1:37:52] <+Mrbaconator> Pat dad stream when
[1:37:58] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> DadPat stream when?
[1:38:00] <@QueequegTheater> Papa Boivin dominates the ladder
[1:38:02] <%SaiyanShoto> Would he stream it?
[1:38:02] <%Puhff> DAMN
[1:38:06] <kazadaz> Patrick are you playing those devil games??  ...Can I join in?
[1:38:07] <%luftraumm1> cystussy
[1:38:08] <SaltyAzteca> yaaaay asscysts
[1:38:09] <bourgeoisdaemon> Oh that item looks good as hell
[1:38:10] <vonmaultke> Yea, this game is a time eater
[1:38:10] <%oda_flobunaga> risk is mostly luck based
[1:38:11] <%Pappajimbo> well there is the pure history total wars
[1:38:14] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I had a friend that was god tier at risk but it was because he just rolled lucky so fucking hard
[1:38:16] <Grave_Titan_D> my uncle won't stop playing Hearts of Iron
[1:38:16] <$scallycap> pretty sneaky, cyst
[1:38:17] <lloyddboy> CYSSY
[1:38:29] <GarbageNirvana> hey cysta soul cysta
[1:38:33] <%luftraumm1> what is more foul asscyst or cyssy?
[1:38:36] <orochiblood> what god of chaos would Papa Boivin play
[1:38:42] <dundore77> its literal free money
[1:38:43] <%Monkeyweed21> spore diffusion is good too
[1:38:54] <%QuasarKnightGaming> As a walking cyst abomination, I swear to serve our lord and savior Nergle well and his people even better, after I got vomit.
[1:38:56] <%oda_flobunaga> @luftraumm1 colostussy
[1:39:00] <bourgeoisdaemon> ABILITY
[1:39:04] <%notsoy> its passive effect is also super-powerful, AOE DOT
[1:39:06] <KroqGar> I think Pat likes Nurgle the most
[1:39:09] <@QueequegTheater> I remember when i was like 8 I showed Starcraft to my dad but it was the Terran survival mission and I got all my dudes killed but won by hiding a barracks away from the base and he was horrified
[1:39:15] <@QueequegTheater> Don't let me run a war
[1:39:20] <%notsoy> take the settlement first
[1:39:21] <Magicalquack> no
[1:39:22] <%Chex868> city
[1:39:24] <+queaks> Attack the city while its undefenderd
[1:39:25] <@PrefectusCorgi> Take town
[1:39:27] <kazadaz> Yeah get that land
[1:39:30] <%notsoy> that way it isn't blocking the way and you can move more easily
[1:39:32] <KroqGar> both in fantasy and 40k
[1:39:33] <%Monkeyweed21> attack city first
[1:39:38] <%MonsterEnvy> Either or
[1:39:49] <%Sotetsu> How big is this game?
[1:39:54] <%luftraumm1> @oda_flobunaga  ain't no colostomy bags or ports in this game i think
[1:39:58] <%Chichen> get down with the sickness oowa ah ah ah
[1:40:01] <$sirtanka> No.
[1:40:02] <$lotharrio> @QueequegTheater I did the same but with my older brother. I had squeaked out a victory previously, but he just went full aggro on the enemy before they started attacking and found it easy.
[1:40:02] <@PrefectusCorgi> no
[1:40:04] <+queaks> Nah we saw one last time
[1:40:04] <%Chex868> no
[1:40:06] <huskarl_zap> nope
[1:40:06] <$realm_forge> The forbidden rod is those giant inch thick candy canes they sell at Walgreens
[1:40:07] <dundore77> not rally
[1:40:07] <bourgeoisdaemon> Fight the battles you want to
[1:40:07] <+JupiterDjin> Test the auto-resolve
[1:40:07] <joodatious> just auto
[1:40:07] <%QuasarKnightGaming> "They are very upset because they are very sick." I mean... >.>
[1:40:07] <+bunchaghosts> no way
[1:40:08] <Yomamma1337> i kind of want to see how auto resolve handles it
[1:40:08] <lloyddboy> more content
[1:40:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes, experience is good
[1:40:10] <%notsoy> "low" casualties is generally when you should autoresolve
[1:40:13] <CatRidder> save firts
[1:40:13] <$scallycap> you know youre doing great when you dont have to play the game
[1:40:13] <%MonsterEnvy> No
[1:40:15] <+OutHereSmokingCrack> it looks cool
[1:40:15] <plaguedoctor_vi> you will always do better than the autoresolve
[1:40:18] <%MonsterEnvy> Just auto
[1:40:18] <%FunkyStreams> define 'play'
[1:40:29] <%king_wragles> Sometimes it's fun to play the easy fights, but some are just way too easy to even enjoy the one-sided ness
[1:40:39] <$sirtanka> Units will flash red if you're going to lose them in the auto-resolve.
[1:40:43] <%Valdorick> The game has gotten MUCH better about just deleting a unit against 3 dudes with swords
[1:40:44] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Thats the Cysts affect!
[1:40:47] <@QueequegTheater> @lotharrio Ironically that's 100% a good strategy for those survive the clock missions, if you can hurt their base enough they can't mount a counterattack
[1:40:52] <%MidnightBurst12> how cute
[1:40:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt tzeentch is your hard counter
[1:40:58] <%Nekros4442> probably want spells
[1:40:58] <+ryderbootz> ehh not yet
[1:40:59] <%Chex868> also nurgle fast regen herlp
[1:40:59] <person181> is tzeentch even on the board?
[1:41:02] <%asgard147> FUCK THAT BIRD-BRAIN! limesHeck
[1:41:02] <$scallycap> you cant outthink death
[1:41:06] <+queaks> Say Teentchcian 10 times fast
[1:41:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> 2nd from the bottom, red skills for commanding
[1:41:08] <%notsoy> you haven't run into any tzeentch factions yet so save it
[1:41:09] <%Broand> hey hey people
[1:41:10] <%MonsterEnvy> I would get Children of Nurgle
[1:41:13] <plaguedoctor_vi> @PatStaresAt At some point in total war warhammer 2 the change the screen to the autoresolve, if you lose a unit that unit is going to glow red
[1:41:15] <%Nekros4442> you arent fightong tzeench atm though
[1:41:18] <%hairtoday> nurgle always hates tzeentch, he's an asshole
[1:41:23] <+ryderbootz> thats the when you take it
[1:41:25] <%Monkeyweed21> you can get whenever yea
[1:41:26] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah
[1:41:27] <$sirtanka> Tzeench is fast with good range, and great magic.
[1:41:41] <kazadaz> Inspiring Presence unlocks buffs for your Nurglings
[1:41:42] <Yomamma1337> is lightning strike still great?
[1:41:44] <iamstilldivorced> Tzeentch are zoners and Nurgle's just a bunch of honest grapplers
[1:41:45] <bourgeoisdaemon> yes
[1:41:45] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Tzeentch is ambition, revolution, and change, of course he counters Nurgle
[1:41:46] <%GingaNZ> YOYOYO is there a pat code for this game?
[1:41:48] <SaltyAzteca> Nurgle is just jealous that Tzeentch has the market cornered Kappa
[1:41:49] <kazadaz> Yah
[1:41:53] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Correct
[1:41:53] <huskarl_zap> yes
[1:41:55] <%MonsterEnvy> Unlocking your spells is a good idea
[1:41:55] <bourgeoisdaemon> 2nd from bottom is passive comanding
[1:41:57] <%notsoy> red is army buffs, yellow is personal skills, blue is campaign-level stuff
[1:41:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AGuyNamedFrank 2nd from bottom is army improvement
[1:41:58] <@PrefectusCorgi> somw what
[1:42:01] <@QueequegTheater> JUST. AS. PLANNED.
[1:42:01] <%Valdorick> Oh thank god, Lightning Strike is a 3 point trait now with the third point being the "okay, just ignore reinforcements now"
[1:42:02] <+queaks> Red is leading troops and yellow is fighting the fight
[1:42:06] <+Rofiarf> naah
[1:42:08] <kazadaz> Hard disagree
[1:42:09] <bourgeoisdaemon> I'
[1:42:09] <%strakillias> Only if units die
[1:42:12] <%Nekros4442> nah
[1:42:12] <%Monkeyweed21> blue is campaign, red is army, yellow is personal
[1:42:13] <Rngiddion> Corruption is more useful
[1:42:14] <darkodargon> its meh
[1:42:14] <JackalKing> The Blue Line is your campaign buffs. The red line is your army buffs. The line above that is your magic. The line above magic is your personal fighting ability. And the ones above that are all special
[1:42:15] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Its decent, and adds up eventually
[1:42:17] <Yomamma1337> second from bottom is cooler
[1:42:18] <bourgeoisdaemon> It's not a big buff
[1:42:18] <joodatious> corruption good
[1:42:18] <%MonsterEnvy> You want CHildren of Nurgle
[1:42:18] <%Valdorick> MORE MONEY is better than cheaper recruit
[1:42:20] <$sirtanka> Recruitment cost is great in mid-late game for higher cost units.
[1:42:22] <+xp194> Blue = Campaign map skills
[1:42:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt upkeep is the big cost
[1:42:25] <dundore77> yes. Red is troop buffs, blue is map buffs, yellow is character buffs, and theres spell lines
[1:42:25] <tgarcia8> Magic is the best option here
[1:42:28] <zenith0111> !uptime
[1:42:28] <@Moobot> @zenith0111 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 42m.
[1:42:30] <Anarbael> it is, nurgle is one of the most expensive faction
[1:42:37] <tgarcia8> Or army buffs
[1:42:38] <%Nekros4442> magic is your best option
[1:42:39] <%Monkeyweed21> upkeep matters way more than recruitment cost
[1:42:43] <%king_wragles> Having more money makes upkeep easier
[1:42:44] <plaguedoctor_vi> For nurgle better recover is better and corription is better
[1:42:47] <@QueequegTheater> So is this turn-based or RTS?
[1:42:48] <%strakillias> Red tree is for after spells
[1:42:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You want Children of Nurgle from the Spellcasting tree
[1:42:52] <JackalKing> Generally if a lord has magic, its best to get magic. If they dont have magic, its best to get army buffs
[1:42:58] <%QuasarKnightGaming> 2 points into corruption, ok
[1:42:58] <+FanServ> @QueequegTheater both
[1:42:59] <bourgeoisdaemon> Spread the nurgliness!
[1:43:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes hes right
[1:43:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @QueequegTheater turn based on the map, rts in battle
[1:43:06] <+queaks> Corrupt the heck out of everyone
[1:43:08] <count_bob> @QueequegTheater RTS
[1:43:10] <%Nekros4442> @anarbael its expensive because nurgle just regens in battle anyway
[1:43:13] <%oda_flobunaga> @QueequegTheater Turnbased over world, RTS battles
[1:43:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt passive heal whenever you cast
[1:43:14] <%notsoy> @QueequegTheater campaign map is turn-based, actual battles are real-time
[1:43:15] <%Valdorick> Heals 1% of a unit's HP everytime you magic.
[1:43:16] <+Rofiarf> passive and triggers when you cast spells
[1:43:18] <person181> can't go wrong with heal
[1:43:21] <+ryderbootz> das preety guud
[1:43:23] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Id make the other guy the spell caster cause kugath has unique tallents
[1:43:23] <%Monkeyweed21> heal EVERYONE whenever you cast
[1:43:27] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Children of Nurgle lets you stay in fights for a much longer time with less risk of unit loss
[1:43:36] <+afrodood> I’d personally go magic but that’s only because I want Pat to see Blight Boil.
[1:43:36] <@QueequegTheater> Oh that's way better
[1:43:55] <$sirtanka> Pull back units when you heal them. It makes the heal more effective for a re-charge.
[1:44:07] <dundore77> you have to consider unit it unlocks too pat
[1:44:15] <kazadaz> Can't go wrong with Control
[1:44:20] <%Chex868> eco goes in small cities mil go in capitals
[1:44:23] <+queaks> Control good
[1:44:30] <%notsoy> check the stats at the left side of the screen, go growth if your control is OK
[1:44:31] <%MonsterEnvy> You will want to build a building so you can recruit so more elite units
[1:44:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> if your control is stable, go growth
[1:45:01] <dundore77> no, all the basic military can fit in the small settlements too
[1:45:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt basic military is better for minor settlements on nurgle
[1:45:07] <person181> minus is hardly ever good
[1:45:08] <@PrefectusCorgi> thats good
[1:45:09] <%MonsterEnvy> You don't need to put it in the capital if a smaller settlement can max it
[1:45:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> is that currnt or change per turn?
[1:45:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> red = bad
[1:45:14] <dundore77> adv military is major settlement
[1:45:34] <%strakillias> -7 cause you just took a settle ment. Control should be +3 next turn
[1:45:39] <+jsleeze> its current turn but especially bad this turn because you captured
[1:45:53] <+RojanBo> !uptime
[1:45:53] <@Moobot> @RojanBo I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 46m.
[1:46:07] <kazadaz> That'll almost double your growth, good early pick
[1:46:11] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You will want to build a military building or you won't have any better units to recruit
[1:46:25] <%MonsterEnvy> As they need to cycle to add their units to the summoning pool
[1:46:25] <bourgeoisdaemon> That can wait
[1:46:28] <%Monkeyweed21> cant go wrong with nurgling spam in the early game
[1:46:31] <+Rofiarf> growth builds at the start is smart
[1:46:32] <lloyddboy> THE BROWN NOTE
[1:46:32] <%GingaNZ> THE BROWN NOTE

[1:47:27] <%notsoy> btw one of the ability flavor texts specifically mentions pus and smegma LOL
[1:47:28] <%IncredibleMeh> is that actually a referance or is that just wildldy coincidental

[1:50:40] <huskarl_zap> Ogres are STRONG
[1:50:41] <%Valdorick> OGRES ARE TOUGH
[1:50:41] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> auto resolve at its best
[1:50:43] <%VentWilsn> thats not good?

[1:50:50] <%SpontaneousC> Auto-resolve likes to favor Large units
[1:50:53] <$sirtanka> Ogor tribes are Tankey as fuck.
[1:50:53] <+ryderbootz> fight for your right to be nasty
[1:50:53] <theoneGalen> LOL the autoresolve in every game ever is bullshit

[1:51:16] <+RealThiele> EASY MODE UNLOCKED
[1:51:20] <@QueequegTheater> they're full of gigachads
[1:51:21] <$scallycap> nuglings are the skaven of warhammer
[1:51:22] <huskarl_zap> ogres are just plain good base stat
[1:51:22] <+queaks> NO its the best!

[1:51:29] <+Rofiarf> just ambush them
[1:51:30] <kazadaz> no that's good, you can camp and kill them when they arrive
[1:51:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurglings are so cheap that the autoresolve undervalues them
[1:51:33] <person181> ohhhh
[1:51:33] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> fuck the reinforcements first
[1:51:35] <%notsoy> it'll take them some time to actually show up though

[1:51:40] <EynoStiles> @patstaresat Are ya winning son? lol
[1:51:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> Can ambush them when they arrive
[1:51:41] <%asgard147> They'll get reinforcements in about 1 minute Pat, work fast
[1:51:41] <%MonsterEnvy> You can check how long it takes for them to arrive by mousing oever
[1:51:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> it's only 2 units, annihilate them when they show up
[1:51:44] <Nikbottom> Ogres fuck huh?
[1:51:45] <%Man_in_the_Red> good gamble
[1:51:45] <huskarl_zap> they were also created to destroy chaos

[1:51:59] <%QuasarKnightGaming> You can set up an ambush on the enemy reinforcements
[1:52:00] <%strakillias> I agree camp on top of reinforcements
[1:52:04] <zerointelligence000> battlemace!
[1:52:07] <EynoStiles> God I wish I had the brain power for this.
[1:52:10] <thepardack> where'd they get all these fuckin bones
[1:52:12] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt If you mouse over the reinforcments you can check how long it takes them to arrive
[1:52:20] <+LastnameSilverLastname> Just fuckin' SEND IT
[1:52:21] <%Man_in_the_Red> i cant believe they changed Gamble, now people think it wont be awful
[1:52:23] <%GingaNZ> dont forget high ground
[1:52:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt reinforcements dont show up for 1:30
[1:52:32] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> remember to always check the terrain too
[1:52:35] <+queaks> Id line up right on the edge so you engage immediately and dont get shot by towers
[1:52:35] <Ravingpyro> nurgle
[1:52:35] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Welcome to the battlefield, nerds
[1:52:48] <%Valdorick> Don't even hide in the woods
[1:52:53] <%Valdorick> just meet them and beat them
[1:52:53] <zenith0111> Pat stares at Defeat?
[1:52:57] <+Cecrios> Fuck the maps look so good
[1:52:59] <+SpinalWizard> Is it wait?
[1:53:01] <%strakillias> It's not like the rest of the enemy will come outside
[1:53:07] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Plague bearers are the slowest unit in the game. Maybe put them closer
[1:53:07] <+JupiterDjin> wait and ambush
[1:53:10] <ItsJustShawn> throw it all at em?
[1:53:13] <@QueequegTheater> Is the plan "FUCKEN SEND IT!"
[1:53:16] <SaltyAzteca> Uh huh
[1:53:17] <%Valdorick> Let the AI get towers up? Kappa
[1:53:28] <%AJ_Cherenkov> it's fine
[1:53:30] <dundore77> those other troops are way too far away
[1:53:32] <zerointelligence000> I love that Pat accepts his status as a Nurgling and plays their faction
[1:53:36] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Ah yes, let the enemy prepare extra internal defenses, that'll work
[1:53:37] <%legendscar01> legendscar01 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months, currently on a 40 month streak!
[1:53:38] <person181> is it a NURGRUSH
[1:53:41] <%Man_in_the_Red> the AI builds towers instantly anyways
[1:53:46] <$scallycap> i like this, let the enemy come to you
[1:53:47] <%Transatlantic_Dylan> I dunno what’s happening but I’m here for it

[1:54:29] <zenith0111> These games make me feel dumb everytime
[1:54:37] <%AJ_Cherenkov> that's what they're for
[1:54:45] <lloyddboy> he has to advance to cast
[1:55:05] <thunderborn32> @zenith0111 i always just feel these kinds of games only half ass explain things
[1:55:07] <bourgeoisdaemon> Youre slow!
[1:55:08] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt whats your opinion on nurgle faction so far?
[1:55:14] <+queaks> Nurgle is the slowest in the game
[1:55:14] <bippityjones> Lmao fuck this we're running away
[1:55:24] <%Valdorick> I'm uh... still confused why you hid in the trees instead of just meeting them at the map edge.
[1:55:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[1:55:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> big legs
[1:55:39] <%AJ_Cherenkov> PRO LIF ER ATION

[1:55:46] <%notsoy> excellent plan
[1:55:46] <Glass_Front> Nurgle be slow
[1:55:47] <$scallycap> well it was a good idea in theory
[1:55:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> strategery
[1:55:49] <%hairtoday> do a magic?
[1:55:49] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Nurgle army is all warty, they don't run very fast
[1:55:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> this was probably the worst ambush i ever saw
[1:55:50] <+queaks> Maybe hiding in trees was not good idea
[1:55:53] <+Totally_Not_Toby> well that sure turned out a way
[1:55:56] <@QueequegTheater> Just as planned
[1:55:57] <kazadaz> Alright, New Plan time
[1:56:01] <+scarman125> you're just slow as hell
[1:56:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Valdorick he didn't want to get shot by towers while waiting
[1:56:07] <+rbakervv> does this game have a super easy mode for babies?  I like strategy games, but I suck at them...
[1:56:09] <Magicalquack> next time pat park the troops where you think they are going to spawn in they will imediately fight
[1:56:11] <%Valdorick> Defeat in detail has failed us today.
[1:56:12] <rufus2k2> where the giant rats that make all of the rules
[1:56:21] <Nikbottom> Frog funny
[1:56:27] <%legendscar01> yes its easy mode
[1:56:32] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @rbakervv I mean, there is easy mode
[1:56:49] <RyuuAoi> Is this another pre recorded Pat tonight?
[1:56:50] <+queaks> This little maneuver is gonna cost us 30 years

[1:57:23] <+Double_negative> You build defenses in settlement defence missions. New mechanic for warhammer 3
[1:57:26] <SaltyAzteca> We'll do it live
[1:57:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:57:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt half the unit is over there
[1:57:43] <$ArcanumArcanum> half that unit is in the encampment lol
[1:57:49] <+queaks> The unit is split lolol
[1:57:50] <+Rofiarf> oh the enemy is split in two
[1:57:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the unit is split
[1:57:50] <%notsoy> half the unit is in a different spot
[1:57:52] <@QueequegTheater> run away
[1:57:53] <Hawkthorne25> You can destroy them temporarily or simply capture the point they are connected to to completely stop them.
[1:57:53] <%Chex868> unit split in two
[1:57:55] <lloyddboy> the unit's split up
[1:57:57] <zerointelligence000> is the ai being fucky?
[1:57:58] <huskarl_zap> they got spit up
[1:57:59] <Nikbottom> NotLikeThis
[1:58:00] <%QuasarKnightGaming> You split a unit lmao
[1:58:02] <kazadaz> That unit of Ogres has been split into two groups, your guys are trying to attack the distant ones
[1:58:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The actual army is in the camp and that spilt isnt real
[1:58:07] <@QueequegTheater> ULTIMATE DECEPTION
[1:58:07] <huskarl_zap> its a bug
[1:58:14] <RyuuAoi> Wow, Pat. This is PC as PC can get.
[1:58:30] <$scallycap> i dont know if youre winning this one
[1:58:37] <kazadaz> Check out them Nurgling combat animations
[1:58:42] <$scallycap> shoulda autoresolved
[1:58:43] <+Rofiarf> out of ammo
[1:58:44] <+queaks> Flies killed a tower
[1:58:46] <+queaks> good flies
[1:58:47] <%Chex868> ogres strong in chock point
[1:58:51] <%legendscar01> bless them with nurgle's treasure
[1:58:54] <%AJ_Cherenkov> it's fine, they still got big balance of power
[1:59:02] <zerointelligence000> I love how nurgle voice acting demands a throat full of phlegm
[1:59:07] <%QuasarKnightGaming> "Nurglings are strong man!!!"  Later: "Nurglings aren't doin the best."
[1:59:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Dat Orgussy too thick for infection
[1:59:16] <huskarl_zap> i think the ogres would win a stand up fight
[1:59:18] <%terrorengine> I usually just auto resolve siege battle in TW games
[1:59:34] <kazadaz> Ironically the sexy demons are the fastest ones
[1:59:34] <%AJ_Cherenkov> they feast on ANY man or beast, even gross ones
[1:59:44] <bourgeoisdaemon> Zoom in on Kugath!
[1:59:47] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @terrorengine sieges are cooler this time... mostly
[1:59:48] <akitanito> your army be smart
[1:59:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> they're a little confused
[1:59:53] <%legendscar01> autoresolving in WH3 won't be smart
[1:59:54] <+Double_negative> Their doing fine, nurgle is just a high defense low attack factions. Fighting is always a slog.
[1:59:57] <huskarl_zap> damn they are really fucking slow
[2:00:01] <kazadaz> It was the shortest path
[2:00:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt FUN FACT: Out of all the chaos gods Nerg is the only one that is legally concidered a warcrime
[2:00:08] <+Flunkorg> oh wow
[2:00:20] <%hairtoday> battle's going great
[2:00:20] <skyshinecrusader> I would love to see pat play Warcraft 2 or 3
[2:00:28] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I'm really glad to see that siege battles are still dog shit
[2:00:28] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this is all kinds of fucked up
[2:00:28] <%king_wragles> You mean considered?
[2:00:28] <+RealThiele> AI seems.... bad
[2:00:30] <+queaks> Nurgle wants to blob so this is good
[2:00:37] <@QueequegTheater> Your army lacks disciprine
[2:00:38] <+KingKrampus> NO VOICE IN OUR EARS BUT THE MAW
[2:00:40] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt you got this pat
[2:00:41] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> slaanesh aint a war crime? Thats surprising me lol
[2:00:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> @doc_ock_rokc is Slanneshi rape a warcrime? I feel like ti should be
[2:00:43] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Yeah, there certainly won't be like... 8 more groups in the camp when we are struggling with 4
[2:00:44] <%Chex868> i mean they are gnoblars wtf u expecr
[2:00:45] <akitanito> this is totally fine
[2:01:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> @JustTheGuyYouNeed This is not siege
[2:01:04] <%notsoy> white flag = broken, skull = perma-broken
[2:01:05] <%Valdorick> @doc_ock_rokc Sounds like a Tzeench ploy to make Nurgle feel bad.
[2:01:05] <Zombrocom> Woah warhammer stream. Hows the goblins?
[2:01:10] <+Flunkorg> @RealThiele Ai in these games are incredibly complicated. Especially since AFAIK they make each faction react differently.
[2:01:12] <lloyddboy> @PatStaresAt meter's full
[2:01:14] <zerointelligence000> you saying gnoblar reminded me of arch and now I feel bad
[2:01:17] <+mechslayer71> oh God he uses groups
[2:01:18] <+KingKrampus> WE RELISH THE SOUND OF ITS CALL
[2:01:21] <RyuuAoi> This is fine. This'll totally work itself out...Hitler's last words.
[2:01:23] <+gruff_gridof> what
[2:01:28] <+ReallyBigRocks> just fuckin nerg em
[2:01:34] <Pookiedaexzile> THEY SCREAM AND THEY RUN BUT THATS PART OF THE FUN
[2:01:36] <%MoaLaMoa> psaGoblin
[2:01:37] <akitanito> that's a warcrime
[2:01:40] <+RealThiele> well this complicated AI is making awful decisions right now
[2:01:41] <+queaks> Watch out for flies!
[2:01:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> @JustTheGuyYouNeed its pretty much the same
[2:01:43] <bourgeoisdaemon> Retreat the fliers!
[2:01:44] <lloyddboy> BUGGOS DYIN

[2:01:50] <%notsoy> the drones are being shot by the towers
[2:01:52] <bourgeoisdaemon> nice!
[2:01:52] <Pookiedaexzile> OGRES!
[2:01:58] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Keep the flies safe!
[2:01:59] <%Valdorick> It doesn't help that Pat put his Plaugebearers into a thin, long line
[2:01:59] <+Rofiarf> oh they got caught
[2:02:05] <%Valdorick> and the unit remembers that formation...
[2:02:07] <%AJ_Cherenkov> yeah, it's the towers
[2:02:09] <+KingKrampus> @pookiedaexzile CAUSE THE OGRES ARE COMING TO GET YA!!
[2:02:11] <Zombrocom> yeah those towers hurt
[2:02:18] <%AJ_Cherenkov> F
[2:02:19] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:02:19] <+Rofiarf> lol they died
[2:02:23] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt the towers are shooting your units probably
[2:02:24] <+Shoosler> they still died, damn
[2:02:26] <Ravingpyro> elmo!
[2:02:28] <+gruff_gridof> F
[2:02:29] <bourgeoisdaemon> ah well
[2:02:31] <+Flunkorg> @RealThiele They also purposefully made it so that the AI can't think for itself to much (to avoid the game playing itself)
[2:02:33] <%asgard147> kitty limesAw psaWink
[2:02:34] <zenith0111> F
[2:02:34] <@QueequegTheater> F
[2:02:34] <%QuasarKnightGaming> The towers you waited for them to set up? They kinda hurt a lot
[2:02:35] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you ignored the towers
[2:02:40] <+scarman125> rip plague drones
[2:02:44] <akitanito> oh god the pathing
[2:02:45] <+Flunkorg> @RealThiele This can cause some weird shit from time to time
[2:02:52] <%legendscar01> F in the Chat
[2:02:52] <bourgeoisdaemon> two lords
[2:02:59] <@QueequegTheater> See this is why I prefer Civ
[2:03:04] <+Double_negative> Break down the barricade blocking your path.
[2:03:09] <+ryderbootz> its actually a good route cuz you gonna flank em
[2:03:12] <%notsoy> smash the barricades
[2:03:13] <+KingKrampus> has pat embraced his destiny as ORB KING of the Ogres yet
[2:03:15] <bourgeoisdaemon> They keep building barricades
[2:03:15] <zenith0111> Towers?
[2:03:20] <+bunchaghosts> break the targets
[2:03:28] <+RealThiele> yea the battles are too much for my smooth brain
[2:03:33] <%Chex868> pats poor army of midgets
[2:03:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @QueequegTheater this is why the Coop campaign lets you delegate units to your friend to micro for you
[2:03:46] <+nwatts1999> Nurg rush kekeke
[2:03:46] <%Valdorick> @RealThiele I'm curious what the Ogre Faction could do against a massively overwhelming force that its going to lose against anyway. More so when Pat is fatiguing his troops.
[2:03:55] <+Flunkorg> People new to this series kind of have to learn that they have to be very specific with there commands and baby there troops.
[2:04:03] <@QueequegTheater> @Monkeyweed21 I mean, I would need a friend for that
[2:04:26] <kazadaz> TW is a sort of hybrid between Game-games and War-sim-games
[2:04:52] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Welcome to Gross Mart Global Enterprises
[2:04:56] <pokketlint60> Pat you don't have to click away from the battle, the flag icon is an automatic retreat function
[2:04:57] <Nikbottom> Help Frogs
[2:05:03] <+queaks> BTW pat when demons lose moral they cruble and disolve
[2:05:08] <+Flunkorg> I'm actually surprised pat was interested in this game since it feels like it would drive him absolutely nuts.
[2:05:08] <Fist_Wizard_Jay> Your interdimensional providers of gross
[2:05:10] <+ryderbootz> Stupendous
[2:05:11] <%Valdorick> Reminder that Rome: Total War was used in a British Gameshow called Time Commander.
[2:05:12] <+KingKrampus> wait pat is papa nurgle?
[2:05:17] <evbites> @Valdorick for ogres war is just a really fun buffet that can kill you
[2:05:18] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt liking the game so far?
[2:05:19] <person181> dope
[2:05:25] <Zombrocom> Banished back to zee realms of chaos
[2:05:26] <DeltaPangaea> It DID drive him nuts before.
[2:05:27] <zenith0111> Oh so demons straight up die
[2:05:27] <%Valdorick> Yeah, they're summoned.
[2:05:29] <%notsoy> yeah, demons losing morale makes them take damage instead of trying to run away
[2:05:30] <Gelphaze> long live Pat the Ogres king eat them all pat!
[2:05:31] <%GingaNZ> really? I thought that was undead?
[2:05:33] <+ryderbootz> yeah demons aint real theyre made of warpstuff
[2:05:34] <DeltaPangaea> But Pat is now strong and powerful.
[2:05:37] <%notsoy> *take MORE damage
[2:05:51] <DeltaPangaea> He is POWERFUL Pat, who can play things like Path of Exile and Total Warhammer.
[2:05:52] <%hairtoday> BEGIN THE HUNT
[2:05:52] <RyuuAoi> Basically the vampires in Blade.
[2:05:54] <%Valdorick> Its Demons now too @GingaNZ
[2:05:56] <+RealThiele> spread ze goo
[2:05:58] <+Flunkorg> @DeltaPangaea Unless he has a doom stack I'm skepticle.
[2:05:58] <%notsoy> you destroyed the camp
[2:05:59] <+KingKrampus> ORB OGRE KING PAT
[2:06:00] <LLCoolZJ> I've been playing M2TW recently and have had some STUPID battles
[2:06:06] <+Rofiarf> whats nurgling tide
[2:06:08] <%GingaNZ> gotcha cheers
[2:06:10] <%notsoy> nurgling tide!
[2:06:10] <%QuasarKnightGaming> You can't TAKE camps from Ogres, its an exclusive thing to them, but you can kill everyone inside and run em out
[2:06:12] <bourgeoisdaemon> Nurgling Tide!
[2:06:16] <+Marsantas> Nurgling tide?
[2:06:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Ogres Will eat even the Infected
[2:06:23] <%notsoy> you should generally take whatever the legendary lord's unique skills are
[2:06:27] <kazadaz> Oh sick
[2:06:32] <evbites> Praise slaanesh
[2:06:50] <huskarl_zap> curse
[2:06:52] <%notsoy> rancid visitations is good vs big monsters and enemy lords/heroes
[2:06:52] <+Flunkorg> I kind of want to see pat try multiplayer.
[2:06:55] <+Flunkorg> I want tears
[2:07:01] <+queaks> So much money pat
[2:07:06] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt they have the ability to explode to do some massive damage if I remember correctly
[2:07:23] <+gruff_gridof> doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain doodBigBrain
[2:07:23] <%AJ_Cherenkov> forsaken are also okay
[2:07:24] <bourgeoisdaemon> That's a long wait for soul grinders
[2:07:38] <%Valdorick> "Oh Soul Grinders!" E1M1 begins
[2:07:40] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Keep an eye out for the units that explode on death, they are NUTS if you get them in a crowd
[2:07:45] <+KingKrampus> alright chat: is pat Papa Nurh
[2:07:48] <+Flunkorg> @queaks Pat doesn't strike me as the type to spend resources.
[2:07:50] <%legendscar01> soul grinders are tier 5 units right?
[2:07:59] <%AJ_Cherenkov> yup
[2:08:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> Great Unclean One is your strongest unit
[2:08:05] <+gruff_gridof> greatest big boy
[2:08:05] <%notsoy> GUO is nurgle's big monster, like kugath's little brother
[2:08:08] <+ryderbootz> hes pretty great
[2:08:12] <+KingKrampus> nurgle or ORB Ogre
[2:08:14] <+RealThiele> greater demon yooo
[2:08:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> War Beast Cavalry
[2:08:39] <%AJ_Cherenkov> pox riders are as close as nurgle gets to Cav
[2:08:40] <Yomamma1337> its a life cycle
[2:08:43] <%Monkeyweed21> War beast cavalry
[2:08:43] <+Rofiarf> do we know any nurgle doomstacks?
[2:08:46] <%notsoy> the buildings transform over time
[2:08:48] <Zombrocom> Your builds grow and die over time
[2:08:49] <plaguedoctor_vi> warbeast but is as close as cavalary as you get
[2:08:50] <huskarl_zap> life cycle
[2:08:53] <Zombrocom> It goes around in a circle
[2:08:53] <Hawkthorne25> From what I read, they will grow into those tiers.
[2:08:56] <+queaks> Basically each time it grows past one of the circles it add one of those units to the pool
[2:08:57] <+Flunkorg> Its different for each faction leader  so have fun with that
[2:08:57] <huskarl_zap> it dies after the apex
[2:08:57] <bourgeoisdaemon> It's a life cycle, they take turns to move into each stage
[2:08:59] <thatrandomlurkingguy> Basically every couple turns, the buildings transform in a cycle.
[2:08:59] <%notsoy> so it takes X turns to turn into the next version, and so on
[2:09:01] <%thbluewarden> the buildings upgrade and decay on their own
[2:09:01] <Visorak6> You rotate around and have peak life cycles
[2:09:03] <%SpontaneousC> Nurgle buildings age and die
[2:09:04] <%AJ_Cherenkov> @Rofiarf prerelease still, no chance
[2:09:04] <darkodargon> your buildings will chage over time
[2:09:05] <%Brassnarwhal> Pat is Nurgle responsible for The Woolie Hole?
[2:09:05] <joodatious> beast of nurgle
[2:09:07] <joodatious> they happy
[2:09:09] <+Marsantas> It cycles through, you can only recruit at certain points in the cycle
[2:09:11] <%QuasarKnightGaming> War beasts are decent
[2:09:13] <Zombrocom> Forsaken and nurglings
[2:09:24] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt it goes in cycles and you have to do research and upgrade settlements to unlock the stronger ones
[2:09:29] <kazadaz> So the building will cycle around, and add 1 copy of its unit to your recruitment pool whenever it moves to a new stage
[2:09:30] <+RealThiele> head to the greater demon ccause they are cool
[2:09:33] <Nikbottom> Burgle: what’s a calvelry? Is it tasty?
[2:09:45] <bourgeoisdaemon> I recommend basic military at this stage
[2:09:48] <%notsoy> right-click to hold a unit card in place
[2:09:48] <Zombrocom> Right click the card
[2:09:51] <plaguedoctor_vi> Forseken is better for flank
[2:10:07] <%Valdorick> @Rofiarf The theory right now is Soul Grinder. AoE Artillery with respectable Melee Stats, plus Nurgle Caster Healing.
[2:10:08] <plaguedoctor_vi> plaguebears is you wall
[2:10:20] <kazadaz> Less tough but more fighty
[2:10:20] <Zombrocom> Forsaken are damage dealer infantry. Not as tanky as plaguebearers but faster and killyer
[2:10:20] <plaguedoctor_vi> forseken go around you wall and flank
[2:10:23] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Plaugebearers are more durable
[2:10:34] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Forsaken are a great unit for killing whatever makes you have to stop charging
[2:10:38] <%legendscar01> Forsaken are faster right?
[2:10:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes
[2:10:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeh they human
[2:10:51] <%maskofmichael> gonna met Nergal in the pot?
[2:10:53] <%QuasarKnightGaming> Yup
[2:10:54] <bourgeoisdaemon> kinda
[2:10:59] <%MonsterEnvy> Plaguebearers also evolve into exaulted Plaugebearers
[2:11:00] <%Valdorick> Forsaken are just dudes. Very good, very strong dudes
[2:11:04] <Zombrocom> You use nurglings and plaguebearers to tank damage and kill with toads and forsaken
[2:11:06] <%Valdorick> Are they still unbreakable?
[2:11:12] <%legendscar01> those plaguebearers have 23 speed, god that sucks so much puss
[2:11:15] <%Valdorick> ... Were they ever unbreakable, did I imagine that?
[2:11:17] <%GingaNZ> So yeah, was there a pat code for this game to buy it? if so what is it
[2:11:21] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Valdorick what?
[2:11:26] <zerointelligence000> I know it's probably early but how is Slaanesh in this game?
[2:11:38] <%Monkeyweed21> @legendscar01 SLOOOOW BOIS
[2:11:53] <%legendscar01> Slaanesh faction overall is basically glass cannon
[2:11:54] <kazadaz> Any unit which causes Fear is immune to Fear/Terror, but otherwise they're normal morale-wise
[2:11:54] <Hawkthorne25> Slaanesh is very fast and seduces the enemies into joining.
[2:12:06] <%Monkeyweed21> @zerointelligence000 super micro intensive but boy can they melt shit, still need to iron out some kinks with the Vassals tho
[2:12:10] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick For some reason, I remember Forsaken having the unbreakable trait in the Warriors of Chaos faction, but I think I'm just having a stroke.
[2:12:22] <%legendscar01> Very squishy, giggity
[2:12:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Valdorick Forseken no they never were which makes no sense, since they are mutated to the point of lost their sanity
[2:12:32] <%notsoy> no, that would be chaos spawn that were unbreakable
[2:12:38] <%That1blindkid> i know the tzeench forsaken are unbreakable
[2:12:44] <%That1blindkid> or is that chaos spawn?
[2:12:45] <%Monkeyweed21> Slaanesh is based on domming the mortal factions until they serve you
[2:12:50] <%Valdorick> Unbreakable just means they don't route off the battlefield
[2:12:54] <%Valdorick> not like, mental unbreakable
[2:13:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @That1blindkid only the spawn are unbreakable
[2:13:16] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Valdorick chaos spwam is unbreakable
[2:13:17] <%Valdorick> SPAWN! That's what I'm confusing them with
[2:13:30] <kazadaz> Today's Wordle is a bit Nurgley
[2:13:35] <%Valdorick> So yeah, just having a stroke, don't mind me.
[2:13:43] <%legendscar01> Chaos spawn in game 2 were unbreakable
[2:13:47] <%notsoy> unbreakable units are immune to all forms of fear/terror and leadership penalties
[2:14:16] <Hawkthorne25> Aye. Which is why a slayer army is so scary.
[2:14:27] <Hawkthorne25> You would have to kill all of them to win.
[2:14:31] <kazadaz> Sorry, I meant Friday's wordle, Australia time
[2:15:05] <%legendscar01> Everybody knows Kairos Fatewaiver is the strongest chaos lord
[2:15:13] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Valdorick yes but if you route it neans you are running away, either for fear or some similar, so a unit that is kind lost should not rout just my opinion tho
[2:15:35] <%Valdorick> Ah, yeah, I get you now
[2:16:29] <%legendscar01> Did pat get infected by nurgle or what?
[2:17:12] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Did Pat win before he went on break?
[2:17:13] <zerointelligence000> is it heretical to be into slanussy?
[2:17:17] <wolfen091> kids?!
[2:17:18] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Hawkthorne25 slayers are more annoying because since they have 0 armor they to down fast so a army of slayer would not be so effective
[2:17:22] <bourgeoisdaemon> SMOOCHIN
[2:17:23] <person181> is your music supposed to be the brown note?
[2:17:23] <+Rofiarf> yes
[2:17:24] <Hawkthorne25> Play the forbidden note!
[2:17:26] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I brown noted myself so hard
[2:17:31] <%Xelig> @zerointelligence000 very
[2:17:35] <+queaks> did zangief sign for it?
[2:17:39] <+Double_Tap_That> I'm sorry to say that I've fallen victim to it
[2:17:39] <evbites> @zerointelligence000 N0
[2:17:42] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Is that why Paige was mad? The trash was full?
[2:17:45] <akitanito> as expected of a follower of nurgle
[2:18:02] <Nikbottom> Good work pat
[2:18:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> go basic
[2:18:08] <%maskofmichael> Of course, we believe you
[2:18:13] <bullprophet> makes sense. WH2 hates having other shit run alongside it too
[2:18:14] <kazadaz> It's a super-robot
[2:18:17] <Hawkthorne25> Sorta.
[2:18:21] <Zombrocom> Soulgrinder is a big spider mech with a poison mortar
[2:18:23] <%hairtoday> bitchin spider tank
[2:18:24] <%Valdorick> Soul Grinders are GREAT
[2:18:26] <%Monkeyweed21> cyborg demon
[2:18:32] <%legendscar01> What's their speed though pat?
[2:18:35] <Hawkthorne25> It has a barfing flamethrower that melts groups of units.
[2:18:38] <Zombrocom> Yes
[2:18:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> yes
[2:18:45] <Zombrocom> Yes and Yes
[2:18:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes
[2:18:46] <%legendscar01> Yes
[2:18:51] <%MonsterEnvy> If they are diffrent
[2:19:00] <+m3chamike> @PatStaresAt Oh no is the performance not great? I'm on an aging gtx1080 because I usually get graphics cards a generation behind... and then 2020 happened...
[2:19:08] <darkodargon> next too upkeep cost
[2:19:09] <bourgeoisdaemon> hes noy
[2:19:11] <Hawkthorne25> The flies?
[2:19:11] <Zombrocom> Isn't it over your flag?
[2:19:13] <%MonsterEnvy> You will have an icon above your head that shows what you have
[2:19:18] <%MonsterEnvy> He's not sick
[2:19:21] <Glass_Front> zoom out
[2:19:24] <+Rofiarf> down
[2:19:27] <Zombrocom> That's not upkeep
[2:19:28] <kazadaz> Top left of the army box I think
[2:19:28] <%notsoy> the army's individual upkeep
[2:19:30] <%MonsterEnvy> It's over top the flag
[2:19:30] <%notsoy> at the bottom
[2:19:30] <darkodargon> no on your army
[2:19:32] <Nikbottom> So sick
[2:19:33] <%Joshbored> that green skull to the left of the cards
[2:19:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> He aint sick!
[2:19:41] <%legendscar01> move the camera on the screen please
[2:19:43] <darkodargon> oh oops my b
[2:19:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @Joshbored thats army abilities
[2:19:50] <%Bluwizard21> I really want a Dark Crusade remake now
[2:19:50] <Zombrocom> Ah ok, you have no active plague
[2:19:52] <Glass_Front> he's cured
[2:19:52] <bourgeoisdaemon> He just glows a lot
[2:19:53] <%notsoy> no, that's his own model
[2:19:53] <plaguedoctor_vi> @bullprophet stange i played the whole life spam since pat stream  of Warhammer 2 while watching some or hearing their podcast
[2:19:53] <%MonsterEnvy> That's just him
[2:19:55] <darkodargon> i guees not
[2:19:56] <+JupiterDjin> save, corrupt yourself and see
[2:20:02] <%notsoy> you would see skulls floating off of him if you were carrying a plague
[2:20:04] <Hawkthorne25> Skaven
[2:20:05] <%Monkeyweed21> he's just vibing
[2:20:06] <zerointelligence000> time to lick a doorknob
[2:20:09] <Hawkthorne25> Don't go for it.
[2:20:14] <%notsoy> finish off the ogres and get all of your first province
[2:20:29] <person181> but now it's personal?
[2:20:31] <akitanito> but what if you lose some people!
[2:20:31] <%legendscar01> Why pat?
[2:20:32] <kazadaz> Sometimes you just wanna see how hard an army hits a wall
[2:20:35] <+JupiterDjin> but at the same time, fuck them.
[2:20:36] <%MonsterEnvy> You should have infected yourself first for the buffs
[2:20:36] <lloyddboy> Bullying is fun!*
[2:20:37] <%strakillias> He gotta learn
[2:20:42] <%hairtoday> spend it getting gud
[2:20:45] <plaguedoctor_vi> @PatStaresAt the autoresolve now shows which units you are going to lose
[2:20:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can keep the beast of nurgle out of combat so it can get its health back up
[2:20:54] <evbites> @zerointelligence000 no you gotta deepthroat the knob so it hits your gag reflex so you vomit on it
[2:20:55] <Hawkthorne25> Throw those nurglings!
[2:21:03] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Cast a bunch and you can heal your army a bit
[2:21:07] <Zombrocom> That is 7 ogres over there. 7 ogres versus the plague horde. Hm.
[2:21:22] <Zombrocom> This also gives your beast time to regen so that's cool.
[2:21:31] <bullprophet> @bullprophet I mean other programs mostly. anything else that's even moderately intensive on the cpu seems to make WH2 chug for me at points
[2:21:31] <Gelphaze> I'm surprised pat didn't go for the Ogres faction but Nurgle would fit just as well for him.
[2:21:36] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Cast spells for the free healing
[2:21:39] <plaguedoctor_vi> "ogers my lord"
[2:21:43] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt don't shoot your own units when they cluster up
[2:21:44] <%Valdorick> Ogres are still under NDA

[2:25:15] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Create a plague cultist and have him infect the dwarfs
[2:25:39] <kazadaz> Dwarfs are tough as shit, I don't know how Nurgle stacks up against them
[2:25:42] <%notsoy> watch out for the plague's current target
[2:25:44] <evbites> Can you name the plauge?

[2:30:03] <%Valdorick> Slav Sqauting
[2:30:10] <%legendscar01> Pat is definitely a true follower of Nurgle in Real Life
[2:30:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Kislev
[2:30:12] <%AJ_Cherenkov> that's bullshit, considering they're surrounded on all sides
[2:30:12] <%Valdorick> From what I've heard, Kislev is NOT for newbies.
[2:30:12] <%SneakTheBeak> SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
[2:30:14] <Zombrocom> Kislev is really cool though

[2:30:20] <+joeyduderman> That is The Empire
[2:30:20] <joodatious> yeah they got bears
[2:30:21] <%legendfather_of_giants> Imperial Guard is Empire
[2:30:22] <huskarl_zap> i mean
[2:30:22] <%MonsterEnvy> Kislev is the Russia
[2:30:23] <%Bluwizard21> i love imp artillery
[2:30:24] <chaosbringer28> no
[2:30:24] <%SpontaneousC> they are not even remotely that no
[2:30:26] <kazadaz> I think the Skaven are the Fantasy equivalent of the Guard
[2:30:26] <huskarl_zap> normal humans
[2:30:26] <+FanServ> empire is the imperial guard really
[2:30:28] <$SGrim> Sure?
[2:30:29] <Arbeh> Eh thats kinda the Empire
[2:30:29] <Zombrocom> Nah, The Empire is the Imperial Guard equivilent
[2:30:30] <%thbluewarden> russia/poland
[2:30:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> Kislev is Russia
[2:30:31] <Hawkthorne25> They are fantasy Poland/Russia.
[2:30:32] <Pookiedaexzile> Imperalism doesn't rule
[2:30:32] <%notsoy> no, that's the empire, fantasy germany
[2:30:33] <plaguedoctor_vi> Kislev is russia
[2:30:34] <%Valdorick> Cathay are the baby bitch faction you learn to play on
[2:30:34] <triangularblasphemy> they ain't guard
[2:30:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> they dont have one
[2:30:37] <Yomamma1337> kislev is poland right
[2:30:37] <triangularblasphemy> BEAR
[2:30:37] <%SpontaneousC> Kislev is basically Heavy Metal Slavs
[2:30:38] <+joeyduderman> Kislev does not have one
[2:30:38] <%Valdorick> Russia
[2:30:38] <+Romuken> space wolves?
[2:30:38] <+ryderbootz> Kislev is the Vostroyan Firstborn
[2:30:39] <Zombrocom> Kislev does not have a 40K
[2:30:39] <+joeyduderman> really
[2:30:39] <+ccwettr123> Kislev are Vostroyans in 40k
[2:30:41] <%AJ_Cherenkov> there isn't an equivalent
[2:30:41] <kazadog> there is none
[2:30:42] <+Rofiarf> russia and poland
[2:30:42] <evbites> Also imperial guard
[2:30:42] <huskarl_zap> theyre eastern europ russians
[2:30:44] <Glass_Front> space wolves
[2:30:45] <%Jeemukun> more like Russia/Eastern Europe
[2:30:46] <%SpontaneousC> Russia, Poland, Siberia, all of that all into one
[2:30:46] <%legendscar01> Kislev is Russia
[2:30:47] <%asgard147> limesPoggers
[2:30:48] <+ninjabush> ooohhh just sit where therre reinforcing and eat them
[2:30:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Kossars
[2:30:51] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt lots of factions didnt make it to 40k
[2:30:51] <TheLegendofNate> Vostruyans
[2:30:52] <bourgeoisdaemon> thanks Paige!
[2:30:52] <%hairtoday> vostroyans probably
[2:30:52] <kazadaz> Damn I can see the fancy from here
[2:30:53] <Zombrocom> Kislev is fantasy russia/poland/slav land
[2:30:53] <rohrvg> empire for sure
[2:30:54] <%MonsterEnvy> Kislev vostroyans in 40k I guess
[2:30:54] <zerointelligence000> a fance-witch
[2:30:57] <+joeyduderman> Yeah.  They are basically Russia
[2:30:58] <Pookiedaexzile> Space Wolves
[2:31:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> Their leader is called the Tzar
[2:31:01] <rohrvg> vostroyan guard
[2:31:02] <+p4ntless> kislev would be the Valhallan and Vostroyan regiments of the imperial guard
[2:31:02] <joodatious> @ccwettr123 literally who lmao
[2:31:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> pain sandwich
[2:31:04] <akitanito> LUL
[2:31:07] <%SpontaneousC> they dont really translate one to one to 40k, not everything does
[2:31:09] <%Monkeyweed21> im suprised Paige didnt cut the crusts to spit Pat
[2:31:09] <%notsoy> 40k factions don't quite translate 1:1 with WHFB
[2:31:11] <kazadog> not everything in fantasy has a 40k equivalent
[2:31:11] <Hawkthorne25> Kislev is one of the factions, like Lizardmen, who have no 40k equivalent.
[2:31:13] <Gelphaze> Crush the little humes PAT!
[2:31:13] <%hairtoday> the sandwich was a trap
[2:31:14] <joodatious> space wolves aren't russion
[2:31:18] <+holliesthalo> i rock the necrons
[2:31:19] <joodatious> they're viking larpers
[2:31:21] <kazadaz> Skaven = Imperial Guard, I will die on this hill
[2:31:21] <%legendscar01> Where's the cheese at?

[2:32:24] <TheGesticulator> Just joined. Has Pat played Total Warhammer games before?
[2:32:24] <kazadog> zangief is a true ogre
[2:32:27] <Zombrocom> Oh yeah, ambush that reinforcement army
[2:32:30] <%legendscar01> spinning suplex those ogres
[2:32:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Orgyns are Allied with Humanity, I want real Ogres who eat people
[2:32:41] <%hairtoday> sandwich for dog
[2:32:42] <kazadog> @TheGesticulator yes but not that much
[2:32:43] <+Romuken> Fair
[2:32:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> it's semi-random
[2:32:46] <%MonsterEnvy> Reinforcments can pick were they come in now
[2:32:47] <%notsoy> do the opposite and bumrush the city
[2:32:48] <+Catpurnicus> you should totally set up a mile away in some  trees
[2:32:48] <Senselessvirus> The paige special: broken glass on rye, extra mustard and poison.
[2:32:50] <plaguedoctor_vi> you can now chose where the reiforciment come from
[2:32:53] <cloakofashes> They want that thick, wet, and juicy Nurge booty.
[2:32:55] <+joeyduderman> Do traitor guard
[2:32:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @Zombrocom buildable towers hurt like shit so its better to rush the points
[2:32:57] <%Puhff> Reinfussies
[2:32:59] <TheGesticulator> @kazadog Gotcha. Thank you!
[2:33:00] <+joeyduderman> those ogres can eat people
[2:33:01] <Hawkthorne25> Wall of nurglings waiting for them?
[2:33:01] <plaguedoctor_vi> but they take time
[2:33:02] <Cameoun570> Cameoun570 subscribed at Tier 1.
[2:33:08] <%legendscar01> Put your army in front of where their actually going to show up not far away lol
[2:33:14] <evbites> @Pookiedaexzile well they still do the imperium is number 1 in teamkilling
[2:33:15] <%notsoy> reinforcements can slightly delay their entry to choose their entry point
[2:33:20] <%Cameoun570> Real plague hours
[2:33:21] <Zombrocom> That army will get here in two minutes
[2:33:22] <+nwatts1999> If you don’t want to be flanked, just set up on the other side
[2:33:22] <+ninjabush> YYYYEEEEESSSSSS KILLL THEM
[2:33:25] <Zombrocom> Keep in mind
[2:33:26] <kazadaz> oh you can ABSOLUTELY spawn-camp reinforcements
[2:33:46] <TheGesticulator> The settlement battles look so much better than in 1 and 2. Like, I may actually play them.
[2:33:57] <+joeyduderman> I am afraid that when this game comes out I will not be able to work over all the blood loss from my brain over my mega huge boner.
[2:34:03] <kazadog> @Pookiedaexzile in 40k tyranids are the faction that eats everything they come across
[2:34:06] <+joeyduderman> KHORNE KOB KOCK

[2:34:27] <%hairtoday> that's a trundle
[2:34:29] <+joeyduderman> It is a field of little Pats
[2:34:37] <Hawkthorne25> Take their weird noses! And put them on our faces!
[2:34:43] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Don't forget casting heals your dudes now
[2:34:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> NOT NORSCA
[2:34:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> OR CHAOS
[2:35:05] <+joeyduderman> Nurgle has never ever ever ever been bad at anything
[2:35:07] <Zombrocom> Every faction is good in campaign
[2:35:10] <%Valdorick> I can't wait for the final Skaven DLC for this game.
[2:35:13] <%Valdorick> *Vermin Lords*
[2:35:15] <+joeyduderman> Papa Nurgle is the golden child of GW
[2:35:16] <joodatious> @legendfather_of_giants this entire game is their redemption lmao
[2:35:18] <Gelphaze> THE PAT OF PESTILENCE
[2:35:20] <%Monkeyweed21> @legendfather_of_giants Chaos already got a rework and Norsca is confirmed for next rework
[2:35:22] <kazadaz> Supposedly Nurgle is low-tier in MP, but speed is way more important vs humans
[2:35:23] <joodatious> this is literally the chaos game
[2:35:32] <+Romuken> Hope they bring the WARP TREX in this game in DLC
[2:35:35] <TheGesticulator> @legendfather_of_giants I at least enjoy Norsca conceptually. I really like beating other factions into submission.
[2:35:36] <+ryderbootz> I really hope the glottkin comes out as an LL
[2:35:37] <plaguedoctor_vi> @Zombrocom say that to Norsca
[2:35:38] <funky_fen> @Valdorick Thanquol
[2:35:47] <+joeyduderman> the other 2 gods get the shaft
[2:35:48] <%Valdorick> Yeyey! My Ratty Boi
[2:35:53] <%SpontaneousC> every faction is good in campaign except warriors of chaos. and launch beast men. and launch wood elves. and several lizardmen lords
[2:35:53] <kazadog> @kazadaz they can always reduce mp unit costs too which matters a ton
[2:35:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> I mean it took 3-5 years
[2:35:55] <%notsoy> speed and missiles are way more important in MP and nurgle has little of either
[2:35:55] <+Troispoint> boosted with the sickest of diseases
[2:35:55] <huskarl_zap> lol
[2:35:59] <Hawkthorne25> Go for the center.
[2:36:00] <+joeyduderman> and they keep trying to make Slannesh a thing
[2:36:00] <Zombrocom> Nurgle is a bit weak in multiplayer but in campaign you just spread plagues everywhere and snowball
[2:36:02] <%legendscar01> hahaha
[2:36:04] <lloyddboy> just cap the point then
[2:36:07] <Hawkthorne25> They lose that and they lose the match.
[2:36:10] <+Troispoint> Skavens are low key adorable
[2:36:17] <kazadaz> TRUDGE! TRUDGE! TRUDGE!
[2:36:17] <thepardack> the word "gnoblars" will never not make me laugh
[2:36:18] <joodatious> @Romuken thats 40k not fantasy
[2:36:18] <Zombrocom> Every game 3 faction* is good in campaign
[2:36:25] <%legendscar01> their acting like actually goblins
[2:36:29] <DeltaPangaea> Skaven best.
[2:36:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can take the capture points to force them to fight you
[2:36:32] <DeltaPangaea> Yes-yes.
[2:36:32] <%notsoy> just take the capture points if they won't stand and fight
[2:36:34] <kazadog> oh no you just get to take and hold the main objectives without resistance what a shame
[2:36:35] <%Valdorick> @SpontaneousC Remember before Orks had "Big Think'n"? The only faction in the game that had to RESEARCH units to unlock them.
[2:36:43] <+ninjabush> yeah you kinda need like harppys or bug boys to fly in a hold them for you stinky boys
[2:36:48] <+Rofiarf> those controll points look like toasters
[2:36:51] <Visorak6> hit em with the old fastball plague
[2:36:51] <kazadaz> oh this charge is gonna SUCK
[2:37:09] <huskarl_zap> fart cloud
[2:37:21] <+Romuken> give'em the ol' dick twist!
[2:37:27] <kazadog> fart gas: the faction
[2:37:35] <%legendscar01> nipple twist them
[2:37:41] <kazadaz> Escalate, Cuno, escalate!
[2:37:46] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget about Kugath's summons
[2:37:46] <thepardack> Nurgle is the last thing I'd want to twist my dick.
[2:37:48] <huskarl_zap> dont know if those nurglings can beat two ogre units
[2:37:53] <+Troispoint> brraaaaappp boys
[2:37:54] <%Valdorick> Grab their dick and infect it!
[2:37:59] <%Valdorick> The old STI!
[2:38:12] <%notsoy> @PatStaresAt breath/wind spells are usually not good against big guys like ogres
[2:38:12] <huskarl_zap> does pat know about unit mass?
[2:38:17] <%Valdorick> Those are massy bois
[2:38:20] <kazadaz> Yeah ogres have so much mass they can just wade past your dudes
[2:38:23] <+Romuken> INFECT THEIR DICK
[2:38:41] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt you can summon nurglings from new skill from Kugath
[2:38:59] <%SodiumPatrol> s i c k b o y s
[2:39:03] <+m3chamike> I just want my ratbois
[2:39:05] <%asgard147> psaGiefstare "Gimme foob"
[2:39:09] <Hawkthorne25> Problem is is that they have more mass and can wade through yours.
[2:39:10] <Zombrocom> Ya might want to send some dudes to the other capture points
[2:39:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Under your face
[2:39:40] <joodatious> is nurgle tide
[2:39:41] <+JupiterDjin> Nugling tide
[2:39:50] <Yomamma1337> gotta click on it
[2:40:00] <%MonsterEnvy> click the button
[2:40:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> it did!
[2:40:03] <Hawkthorne25> It was too close
[2:40:05] <Zombrocom> It summoned them on top of ol kugath
[2:40:07] <bourgeoisdaemon> last unit on the line!
[2:40:08] <%notsoy> new nurgling unit appeared, check the bars
[2:40:09] <+Rofiarf> is it on cd?
[2:40:11] <joodatious> click it pat and choose the location
[2:40:12] <plaguedoctor_vi> you last unit card
[2:40:18] <Zombrocom> It's the last unit on your bar
[2:40:19] <@PrefectusCorgi> the last card
[2:40:20] <%Monkeyweed21> unit card
[2:40:33] <%legendscar01> their fighting the general it seems
[2:40:49] <%MonsterEnvy> You can have the new summoned ones self destruct
[2:40:58] <joodatious> oh wow they're cycle charging
[2:41:05] <Visorak6> That lord's having a real bad time
[2:41:08] <%MonsterEnvy> Army ability charged
[2:41:12] <Zombrocom> Should capture the other points
[2:41:13] <count_bob> They are vibin
[2:41:18] <kazadaz> You gotta keep in mind that units in this game are kinda sticky, so it's hard for a unit to extricate itself from a big moshpit (unless it's heavy like an ogre)
[2:41:20] <zhenthrim213> nah nurle units just do no dmg
[2:41:21] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt those new nurglings can explode I think just don't do it when your units are around
[2:41:26] <joodatious> plague bearers dont do alot of damage lol
[2:41:27] <Zombrocom> This is a lot of tanky dudes beating each other
[2:41:33] <%fanciful_fright> Haven't seen anything gameplaywise for TW:WH3, but am I right in assuming that basically every unit Pat has right now are Skavenslave levels of expendable?
[2:41:34] <evbites> imagine if chaos units had a self destruct button
[2:41:40] <plaguedoctor_vi> i mean so many units are fighting him like there many units there that are not doing anything
[2:41:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> nurgle units do like no damage
[2:41:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> it was the summon
[2:41:48] <%notsoy> it was the summopned nurgling
[2:41:59] <+Troispoint> chaos is just vibes
[2:42:05] <%notsoy> summoned units will eventually start to break apart and die after a while
[2:42:12] <kazadaz> Especially Slaanesh
[2:42:24] <Nikbottom> If you had to fight a chaos god, I feel like Nurgle would be the worst
[2:42:27] <bourgeoisdaemon> Damn! He's very slowly getting away!
[2:42:31] <Visorak6> SIR, SIR!
[2:42:32] <lloyddboy> EXCUSE ME
[2:42:39] <%legendscar01> kill him pat
[2:42:41] <akitanito> they are barely hitting him
[2:42:41] <zhenthrim213> @Nikbottom Slaneesh
[2:42:52] <blakeout> Killing the general is always worth for the extra reward
[2:42:52] <+takotoots> LUL
[2:42:54] <%Monkeyweed21> @fanciful_fright Nurglings are basically free and infinite but the rest of Nurgle units are valuable
[2:42:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> ARMY ABILITY
[2:42:57] <akitanito> baby steps!
[2:42:57] <studleydoorite> this game is bitrate poison huh
[2:42:58] <Visorak6> THE JOESTAR FAMILY TECHNIQUE
[2:42:58] <%Monkeyweed21> MASS
[2:42:58] <huskarl_zap> lol bye
[2:43:00] <heli0hso> we got a draft dodger
[2:43:07] <%Bluwizard21> he skiddadled
[2:43:09] <+Double_Tap_That> RUN FORREST RUN
[2:43:13] <vonmaultke> waddle to live LUL
[2:43:14] <+Ataraxis9> play benny hill music
[2:43:15] <TheRelaxedOne> he got there in the end XD
[2:43:15] <evbites> @Nikbottom yeah would rather get murdered quick or have my soul eaten then fight a pus covered mass
[2:43:20] <+queaks> would you multiplayer stream with adeptus rediculous?
[2:43:21] <darkodargon> well done pat
[2:43:25] <Brutusness> Jack sparrow running
[2:43:25] <lloyddboy> GNOBLARS DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE
[2:43:44] <kazadaz> NOICE
[2:43:51] <%MonsterEnvy> We are even cheaper
[2:43:52] <%kittenby> CHASE HIM DOWN AND EAT HIM
[2:43:53] <%fanciful_fright> @Monkeyweed21 Ah good to know. I plan on playing some flavor of chaos on launch and prefer the densest of murderballs as my playstyle.
[2:43:53] <%legendscar01> That's awesome Pat
[2:43:53] <person181> THAT'S SO GOOD
[2:43:57] <joodatious> YEAH BRUNTOS
[2:43:59] <TheGesticulator> So this man's name really is just "Bruntos Shitter".
[2:44:01] <%Monkeyweed21> NURGLINGS EVEN MORE FREE
[2:44:02] <+vaultzombie> I thought that said Glut Porn
[2:44:04] <Hawkthorne25> So, in the red line? Invest in Nurglings.
[2:44:07] <+JupiterDjin> Bruntos Bowelpurge, now there's a name
[2:44:09] <TheLegendofNate> Some of the heaviest system testers besides the straight fps or triple a eye candy
[2:44:09] <kazadaz> Father you can pay us even less
[2:44:10] <blakeout> nurgling spam powerful
[2:44:18] <%epide> dont forget that killing legendary lords gives a perm passive skill
[2:44:24] <%legendscar01> @PatStaresAt Wand of Jet, equip it, its good
[2:44:30] <Dalthine> Dang, Pat gets to play this thing a whole week early?
[2:44:30] <%notsoy> always check the top row
[2:44:41] <%notsoy> for legendary lord-specific skills
[2:44:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @fanciful_fright Nurgle's whole playstyle is to make a big unkillable blob that slowly debuffs and melts the enemy while your flying units tie up their range, basically Vampire Counts x10
[2:44:51] <Hawkthorne25> Yes.
[2:44:53] <%MonsterEnvy> It's helpful later on
[2:44:55] <+Catpurnicus> you are getting shot up by towers
[2:44:55] <kazadaz> Eh, it's nice but not a priority IMO
[2:44:55] <blakeout> unique line, the one along nurgling tide is quite strong
[2:44:55] <joodatious> yeah eventually
[2:44:55] <%notsoy> missile resist = less damage taken from shots
[2:44:56] <plaguedoctor_vi> @epide you mean the trait? is that not only for the legendery ones?
[2:44:57] <darkodargon> hes a big target
[2:44:58] <Hawkthorne25> Big boy = Big target
[2:45:02] <%notsoy> which includes artillery, yes
[2:45:03] <TheGesticulator> Missile resist is good with large units since they can get focused down.
[2:45:03] <Visorak6> Its a long term upgrade
[2:45:05] <%notsoy> PLAGUE SHIELD
[2:45:05] <%legendscar01> Yes its good
[2:45:20] <bobdoletrasher> @PatStaresAt hates sseth?!
[2:45:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> YEP thats good
[2:45:33] <%notsoy> yeah, check that row whenever you level, it's almost always good shit
[2:45:33] <kazadaz> Sometimes One Guy is a hero
[2:45:35] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Good Call
[2:45:38] <joodatious> you
[2:45:40] <plaguedoctor_vi> you shot actually
[2:45:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Kugath shoots stuff
[2:45:43] <%legendscar01> Jugath shoots Pat
[2:45:43] <%Valdorick> Kugath for one. Soul Grinders for 2
[2:45:45] <zhenthrim213> KU,GATH
[2:45:47] <%legendscar01> Kugath
[2:45:51] <Zombrocom> The power at the end of the line starting with Hard To Hit is really good
[2:45:55] <%epide> pat your hero shoots
[2:45:58] <Hawkthorne25> Rancid?
[2:46:01] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the top skill line for Legendary Lords is unique and almost always worth focusing on
[2:46:11] <TheGesticulator> @bobdoletrasher I love the extent to which Sseth is nega-Mandalore.
[2:46:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> Rancid is veryn good
[2:46:17] <%legendscar01> Rancid
[2:46:28] <Visorak6> Yeah you take a LONG time to kill heroes
[2:46:33] <%notsoy> yeah stream for blobs, rancid for big boys
[2:46:35] <Hawkthorne25> The fireball you have is good for that too.
[2:46:44] <%legendscar01> Wand of Jet gives you more magic Pat if you equip it
[2:46:46] <bobdoletrasher> @TheGesticulator LUL
[2:46:50] <%notsoy> you can just infect the city directly though
[2:47:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> Rancid is also good against low-number units like ogres @PatStaresAt
[2:47:06] <bourgeoisdaemon> Going well so far
[2:47:13] <Visorak6> HE WANTS SOME
[2:47:17] <plaguedoctor_vi> Kug´gath is actually a Artillery i don´t even know why when he attacks he get close
[2:47:18] <ProfessorBadvibes> hi pat
[2:47:23] <bourgeoisdaemon> Diplomacy with the beastmen may help
[2:47:32] <%notsoy> that's a rebellion
[2:47:36] <+Catpurnicus> its a faction you've ignored until now
[2:47:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> minor Nurgle faction
[2:47:42] <%notsoy> their city was in such bad straits that a rebellion happened
[2:47:43] <%GalacticaPhanto> he's Nerghalin for a Gurgalin
[2:47:45] <%MonsterEnvy> Nurgle rebllion
[2:47:49] <bourgeoisdaemon> Corruption spawned a nurgle demon army
[2:47:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> you dont
[2:47:55] <+SimplyRandy> THE DAWI ARE GOING TO WAR!!!!!
[2:47:56] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt rebellion from too much corruption
[2:47:56] <lloyddboy> GARRY SON
[2:47:58] <%MonsterEnvy> Infect them with more stuff
[2:47:59] <Visorak6> Avoid
[2:48:00] <Zombrocom> Uh. Ambush it?
[2:48:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You die
[2:48:01] <%Valdorick> You fuck'n run like a bitch
[2:48:02] <huskarl_zap> GET  into the settlement
[2:48:02] <%notsoy> go back to the city and kill the dorfs
[2:48:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> Use settlement as protection!
[2:48:05] <+Marsantas> You let them take it and retake it later
[2:48:06] <@PrefectusCorgi> Die
[2:48:06] <%Monkeyweed21> Defend
[2:48:09] <alexandus_> destroy them with covid
[2:48:09] <TurtlesAndTentacles> what is the appeal of these sorts of games
[2:48:13] <+SimplyRandy> Avoid them and let the plague do it's job
[2:48:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt at this point, you dont deal with that
[2:48:16] <person181> "that's the neat thing, you dont'"
[2:48:20] <+Catpurnicus> make those cavalry beast things
[2:48:20] <bourgeoisdaemon> Let them break upon your putrid walls!
[2:48:33] <Nikbottom> That’s the thing…
[2:48:40] <+SimplyRandy> @TurtlesAndTentacles Big cinematic battles, power fantasy, strategic & tactical complexity, multiplayer, co-op, versus, etc
[2:48:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> go growth
[2:48:51] <count_bob> @TurtlesAndTentacles Tactical and strategic gameplay.
[2:48:51] <%notsoy> yeah, more growth is always good
[2:48:53] <Pookiedaexzile> @TurtlesAndTentacles You ever wanna be a General?
[2:48:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> stuff that gives growth is best in the long run
[2:48:58] <bourgeoisdaemon> never the wrong choice early game to do growth
[2:49:02] <Soginha> Save game
[2:49:10] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Basic military buildings are good in the minor settlements
[2:49:11] <%Valdorick> Growth is good until it isn't.
[2:49:29] <Nikbottom> Can’t go wrong with money
[2:49:30] <TheGesticulator> Yeah, if I don't get an immediate growth building I just feel like the game slows to a crawl.
[2:49:31] <bourgeoisdaemon> See his plague is above Kugath name
[2:49:34] <%Valdorick> And yeah, look for buildings that cap at level 3, and build those in the baby bitch cities that can't go to level 4
[2:49:37] <sheeperson34> the way you're playing this game is driving my boyfriend NUTS
[2:49:38] <+SimplyRandy> yep
[2:49:43] <%Valdorick> Correct
[2:49:47] <Pookiedaexzile> The Real Appeal of these games is  taking your favor faction and mumbling memes about your faction to yourself while you play
[2:49:47] <%notsoy> yeah, growth until your cities max out is usually the best approach
[2:49:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah, then you demolish for money/military
[2:49:49] <+SimplyRandy> THEY"RE RUNNIN
[2:49:52] <bourgeoisdaemon> FUCKEN DORFS
[2:50:00] <bourgeoisdaemon> FUCK OUTTA HERE
[2:50:02] <TurtlesAndTentacles> these are good answers chat
[2:50:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> If only Bardin was in that army.
[2:50:15] <Nikbottom> LUL
[2:50:17] <%Valdorick> "Making us leave the hold then bitching back to your city, thus wasting our time? That's a grudge'n"
[2:50:19] <%notsoy> the dwarfs will probably come back the next time you leave the city though
[2:50:25] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is this game a good starting point in trying this sort of thing out?
[2:50:29] <+joeyduderman> Pat.  Slannesh is NEVER cool.
[2:50:38] <Visorak6> Uh
[2:50:38] <person181> HA NO
[2:50:39] <Visorak6> Okay
[2:50:42] <Visorak6> LUL
[2:50:46] <+joeyduderman> I would say to buy the first Total war WMarhammer
[2:50:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah no
[2:50:48] <%notsoy> click the city
[2:50:50] <bourgeoisdaemon> Lucky!
[2:50:55] <+Catpurnicus> lol maybe later
[2:50:58] <person181> grandfather gets around huh
[2:50:59] <+SimplyRandy> CULT MECHANICS
[2:50:59] <studleydoorite> credulity jermaVenus
[2:51:00] <Nikbottom> Slanted here was always cool
[2:51:01] <%notsoy> you can build inside that city
[2:51:05] <%Valdorick> Slannesh? You mean that bitch who loses to the Great Horned Rat-Rat!?
[2:51:06] <lloyddboy> why does being a slaanesh dude make you have one tiddy
[2:51:07] <+Marsantas> They are helping you for later
[2:51:08] <joodatious> there is now a cult in that city
[2:51:19] <TheGesticulator> @TurtlesAndTentacles It's as good a place as any. If you're unfamiliar with RTSs then your first will always be a bit overwhelming. You kind of just have to throw yourself into it and take a few hours to go through the motions until it makes sense.
[2:51:19] <+Catpurnicus> oh so it just captures it for you?
[2:51:19] <+Marsantas> They are spreading nurgle corruption
[2:51:19] <huskarl_zap> you
[2:51:24] <Zombrocom> It's a neutral nurgle faction
[2:51:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> ORKS?
[2:51:31] <plaguedoctor_vi> @PatStaresAt Since that is a nurgle minor faction they have you corruption so because of that you where able get a cult there
[2:51:38] <Visorak6> They are basically zealots you can choose to help?
[2:51:38] <huskarl_zap> its a cult inifltration building
[2:51:39] <TheRelaxedOne> it's chaos corruption
[2:51:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> This is part of your corruption mechanics
[2:51:43] <+SimplyRandy> As chaos corruption spreads, you can have higher chances of a "cult" appearing in nearby regions. Cults allow you to build buildings which generate faction specific resources for you
[2:51:51] <Zombrocom> A cult is like a secret mini city inside a city
[2:51:55] <studleydoorite> @lloyddboy tiddy rationing, it is war after all
[2:51:58] <bourgeoisdaemon> Cult = Undercity
[2:52:07] <juggernaut246> Essentially you get building slots in other empires cities
[2:52:12] <Zombrocom> You get to build one of 4 options
[2:52:15] <TheGesticulator> @SimplyRandy That's fucking rad. I got frustrated that every form of corruption just meant people were unhappy. It was a bit bland.
[2:52:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @thegesticulator That makes sense
[2:52:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> it is
[2:52:24] <plaguedoctor_vi> infection is always better
[2:52:24] <+SimplyRandy> Ye that's the safest one
[2:52:27] <Zombrocom> It's reliable
[2:52:28] <%notsoy> yeah, that one will be most consistent
[2:52:30] <%Valdorick> So, Static +5, or +10 with effects active
[2:52:37] <%fanciful_fright> First one is the only reliable option.
[2:52:46] <joodatious> beast fuckers
[2:52:46] <bourgeoisdaemon> Do diplomacy with them!
[2:52:50] <Visorak6> beastfolk
[2:52:51] <Nikbottom> Interesting
[2:52:51] <lloyddboy> Beastie Boys
[2:52:58] <TheGesticulator> @TurtlesAndTentacles Look up Mandaloregaming's video over the series to figure out where to start. There's a fuckton of DLC and the way the games connect is weird.
[2:52:58] <%Valdorick> Beastmen LOVE Chaos Gods
[2:52:58] <+SimplyRandy> I don't think anyone has ever described a beastman hoirde as "chill" lmao
[2:53:10] <kazadaz> Mr Tumnus and his roided-out friends
[2:53:10] <akitanito> oh they no chill
[2:53:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you have to offer them somethign too
[2:53:25] <plaguedoctor_vi> you can give some money
[2:53:25] <royvictus> yeah but you stinky :(
[2:53:28] <%MonsterEnvy> Do a  quick deal
[2:53:30] <bourgeoisdaemon> They don't fear you enough yet
[2:53:31] <Not_Paladin> no friendship allowed
[2:53:32] <%MonsterEnvy> you can make it work
[2:53:33] <%notsoy> there's a "quick deal" button if you want to just make it easy
[2:53:34] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Beastmen have not chill, lol
[2:53:36] <+ryderbootz> he beastman, he angy
[2:53:39] <%notsoy> or you can declare war on mutual enemies
[2:53:40] <person181> offer not to kill them
[2:53:41] <%Valdorick> Either butter his butthole, or fuck'n kill him and sacrifice him.
[2:53:43] <%CalderGaming> Team! Diplomacy has failed!
[2:53:43] <%fanciful_fright> Or give a little monies
[2:53:44] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @thegesticulator thank you for the recommendation!
[2:53:57] <alextrebeken> you are a plague demon, of course
[2:54:07] <%terrorengine> ?
[2:54:13] <bourgeoisdaemon> hover all the buttons
[2:54:15] <kazadaz> Ah who cares, he's a weakling anyway
[2:54:17] <TheGesticulator> It's kind of like Civ where it needs to be considerably more worth it to them until you're besties.
[2:54:17] <Yomamma1337> whats troubling you?
[2:54:21] <%Valdorick> "Non-Agress with us or we'll fucking KILL YOU"
[2:54:23] <%Monkeyweed21> READ BUTTONS
[2:54:26] <TheRelaxedOne> just give a bit of money, you can even let the game balance it
[2:54:42] <kazadaz> "Quick Deal" is a way to search if ANYONE would like to make a deal w you
[2:54:45] <%MonsterEnvy> You have to offer some money
[2:54:52] <+RealThiele> [Deal]
[2:54:52] <royvictus> You are negotiating with a cow
[2:54:53] <+SimplyRandy> balance the deal with MONEY
[2:55:02] <%Valdorick> paying him seems like its not worth it
[2:55:03] <SpookyBeef7> Aren't Beast Tribes not normally able to have alliances?
[2:55:06] <%Valdorick> Just attack him and kill him.
[2:55:06] <Glass_Front> there's an auto balance button
[2:55:08] <sheeperson34> just kill them
[2:55:08] <+SimplyRandy> it will say after you select an ammount
[2:55:09] <%Caped_Eggy> Start with a small amount
[2:55:09] <%MonsterEnvy> You will see it balance
[2:55:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> hit the check
[2:55:10] <+Totally_Not_Toby> give him one dollar
[2:55:12] <SpookyBeef7> Or did they change that with 3?
[2:55:13] <%Valdorick> Make him pay YOU.
[2:55:17] <sheeperson34> they will just sit on your land and raid
[2:55:18] <+Marsantas> Well offer a little and see how they see it
[2:55:21] <+SimplyRandy> the checkmark doesn't reduce it right away
[2:55:22] <plaguedoctor_vi> you see the -1,3? you need to get it to +
[2:55:28] <%fanciful_fright> You shouldn't need much persuasion, 300 would prolly work. You just gotta kinda feel it out by instinct.
[2:55:28] <Yomamma1337> "balance offer"
[2:55:32] <Not_Paladin> offered him 1 whole coin
[2:55:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> Autobalance button is greyed out
[2:55:39] <TheRelaxedOne> yeah, guess they will just not do it
[2:55:40] <huskarl_zap> its greyed out
[2:55:47] <%abcismasta> @patstaresat I missed the race select, what all factions can you play? Cheer500
[2:55:51] <@Fuggins4U> Fuggins4U subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 25 months! Enjoy plsy
[2:55:51] <Nikbottom> Give him 20 bucks
[2:55:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Looks like he won't do it
[2:55:55] <kazadaz> It don't mean shit
[2:55:55] <+Totally_Not_Toby> he hates it i guess
[2:56:00] <Yomamma1337> they dont want to sign it
[2:56:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you don't have enough to offer him
[2:56:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> If it's greyed out they won't do it
[2:56:02] <+Catpurnicus> yeah they won't play ball
[2:56:03] <Glass_Front> wait, it's not letting you do any peace treaty
[2:56:05] <%notsoy> check the number at the bottom, sometimes money won't actually grease the wheels
[2:56:14] <bourgeoisdaemon> Beastmen often don't care about money, you can threaten them tho
[2:56:18] <+aWanderingKaivo> "I'm gonna give you a hundred dollars to fuck off"
[2:56:18] <+afrodood> You don’t have enough resources to make them sign.
[2:56:19] <+mrredwednesday> Diplomacy was never an option
[2:56:25] <%Valdorick> @abcismasta Cathay (China), Kislev (Russia), 4 Chaos Gods, Ogres, Chaos Undivided
[2:56:28] <royvictus> Pretty sure Beastmen don't care about money
[2:56:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Time for murder
[2:56:47] <bourgeoisdaemon> auto that
[2:56:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh did you see the button to kick them out of your territory
[2:56:53] <+SimplyRandy> what a stomp
[2:56:57] <SpookyBeef7> Disease for everybody!
[2:56:59] <+ALazo> slapped
[2:57:05] <royvictus> wow! That is a big green boi
[2:57:05] <Nikbottom> What a good plague
[2:57:12] <%abcismasta> @valdorick noice
[2:57:12] <bourgeoisdaemon> only auto equips if empty slots
[2:57:14] <+SimplyRandy> only auto equips if its an empty slot
[2:57:16] <%MonsterEnvy> one
[2:57:17] <%legendfather_of_giants> 1 per character
[2:57:21] <%notsoy> you can only ahve one of each type of item
[2:57:21] <Yomamma1337> 1 arcane item
[2:57:25] <%Caped_Eggy> Only 1 for each type
[2:57:31] <kazadaz> Those are all Arcane Items, and you've only got 1 Arcane slot
[2:57:48] <%maskofmichael> rotting cock snake?
[2:57:52] <Nikbottom> One rods
[2:57:53] <+vaderxyz1970> OMG those poor nurglings
[2:57:59] <%MonsterEnvy> You took off his weapon
[2:58:00] <%Valdorick> ... why'd you take off his weapons?
[2:58:00] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Re-equip your weapon maybe?
[2:58:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> not enough range, otherwise you can
[2:58:02] <thepardack> mr. bowelpurge was my father
[2:58:14] <bourgeoisdaemon> Gotta head south and get that other port
[2:58:26] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can salvage and fuse magic items now
[2:58:42] <kazadaz> Those ogres are like an infection
[2:58:54] <Glass_Front> Yay! we got sick!
[2:58:59] <akitanito> why would you care about getting sick though
[2:59:13] <+SimplyRandy> blood for the blood god
[2:59:16] <studleydoorite> down with the sickness jermaVenus
[2:59:28] <%MonsterEnvy> You may need a second lord to chase the Ogres down
[2:59:35] <huskarl_zap> yes
[2:59:37] <%Caped_Eggy> Yes
[2:59:37] <kazadog> yes
[2:59:39] <funky_fen> Yes
[2:59:41] <Nikbottom> Can the other demons get sick?
[2:59:41] <lloyddboy> they do that
[2:59:42] <%notsoy> yes, there's a button to warn him to fuck off
[2:59:45] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes, tell him to leave with tha hand button @PatStaresAt
[2:59:50] <+Totally_Not_Toby> those motherfuckers
[2:59:51] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes he is raiding you
[2:59:51] <person181> sure seem like it
[3:00:05] <TheGesticulator> @legendfather_of_giants That's a nice fucking addition. It got super frustrating that your options were genocide or being a doormat.
[3:00:14] <%notsoy> OOOH
[3:00:28] <bourgeoisdaemon> YOOOOOOOOOO
[3:00:31] <studleydoorite> your dude must be cold
[3:00:34] <%notsoy> ward save = universal damage reduction
[3:00:35] <%Caped_Eggy> Yo that's pretty good
[3:00:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> That item is turbo good!
[3:00:42] <kazadaz> Ward save reduces ALL damage always
[3:00:47] <%notsoy> NO you still had movement range lol
[3:01:02] <bourgeoisdaemon> Steamship
[3:01:03] <%notsoy> you had movement range you didn't use before the turn ended BTW
[3:01:04] <%Chex868> kind of
[3:01:07] <funky_fen> steamship
[3:01:15] <%Monkeyweed21> dwarf ship
[3:01:18] <+Squid5_> ironclad
[3:01:41] <bourgeoisdaemon> They're leaving
[3:01:44] <+SimplyRandy> you told em to leave, they're leaving
[3:01:51] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Ward save apparently reduces all damage
[3:01:57] <+scarman125> why unfortunately? Nurgle loves being sick LUL
[3:02:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> Get da Glut Port!
[3:02:18] <+vaderxyz1970> @scarman125 Nurgle just loves
[3:02:22] <%notsoy> more heroes = better
[3:02:22] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:02:23] <bourgeoisdaemon> More heroes is super good
[3:02:27] <%MonsterEnvy> That's pretty good Plaugeridden are helpful heroes
[3:02:30] <%Kiso52> ayo papa bless!
[3:03:08] <zhenthrim213> Nurgle campagin is slow
[3:03:15] <%Monkeyweed21> Nurgle is the SLOW faction
[3:03:23] <Visorak6> You need to be there I think?
[3:03:25] <bourgeoisdaemon> 2 turns until the building grows some forsaken
[3:03:26] <Paragon_Sheep> Not in the area with them
[3:03:31] <+SimplyRandy> are you in the same province?
[3:03:31] <kazadaz> When that building moves to next stage, it'll add 1 forsaken to your pool
[3:03:33] <+scarman125> yeah I'm not sure how I feel about how Nurgle's buildings work
[3:03:34] <%Monkeyweed21> they need to add more to the pool
[3:03:35] <bourgeoisdaemon> No!
[3:03:39] <%Caped_Eggy> You are in a different province I think
[3:03:40] <Glass_Front> building needs to grow more
[3:03:40] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Everytime the thing cicles it will add a Forsaken to to the pool
[3:03:41] <+SimplyRandy> you just have to be in the province, not the region
[3:03:42] <huskarl_zap> need to be in the region that has the bbuilding
[3:03:45] <bourgeoisdaemon> Need 2 more turns!
[3:03:50] <%notsoy> it takes time for nurgle buildings to add to the recruitment pool
[3:03:53] <Paragon_Sheep> No no disregard us listen to Bourgeois
[3:03:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt they only add units to the pool when they cycle
[3:04:03] <%MonsterEnvy> 2 more turns until it adds one
[3:04:08] <%notsoy> no
[3:04:13] <@PrefectusCorgi> no
[3:04:15] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont get one at the start, just when it cycles back
[3:04:17] <%notsoy> it will take 2 more turns for it to add one, and then 4 more to add another
[3:04:23] <kazadaz> No, happens when it FINISHES a stage, it's still on the first one
[3:04:45] <bourgeoisdaemon> More growth?
[3:04:46] <%notsoy> yeah, this mechanic looks like such a pain in the ass
[3:04:49] <%MonsterEnvy> I recommend getting some more plague bearers
[3:04:59] <%notsoy> as opposed to conventional turn-based recruitment
[3:05:22] <bourgeoisdaemon> 4th infra building speeds up cycle times
[3:05:23] <%Monkeyweed21> advanced is only for major settlements
[3:05:51] <studleydoorite> plupYUMYUM
[3:06:19] <%notsoy> or...not?
[3:06:19] <kazadaz> So ALL the econ buildings just give you nurglings constantly
[3:06:22] <huskarl_zap> those are serious
[3:06:23] <%Valdorick> Off to slutport, what?
[3:06:32] <zhenthrim213> i mean he is in your hell
[3:06:36] <lloyddboy> GETTING CLOSER
[3:06:42] <alexandus_> nobody likes dwarfs lol
[3:06:43] <bourgeoisdaemon> HATES DWARFS
[3:06:48] <zhenthrim213> the DRAK BOYS
[3:06:48] <huskarl_zap> Thats a doom stack protect your settlements
[3:06:48] <person181> OH NOW THEY WANT IT
[3:06:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> 2k HELL YEAH
[3:06:52] <%Valdorick> Its fine, those are a pirate raider faction. They'll only attack you if you're on sea.
[3:06:55] <bourgeoisdaemon> Money don't mean shit to Beastmen
[3:07:06] <%Valdorick> GOOD JOB STUMBO
[3:07:08] <+SimplyRandy> What a deal
[3:07:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> you grew in power since probably
[3:07:12] <%notsoy> you threatened them LOL
[3:07:15] <%Caped_Eggy> NICE
[3:07:27] <TheGesticulator> Yeah there's like a bell curve of how much people like you and your power level.
[3:07:33] <juggernaut246> Diplomacy in Total War has not been the Traditional strong suit of the series
[3:07:44] <%fanciful_fright> Oh no, you were just messing up before Pat. You were trying to autobalance but there was nothing to balance instead of finalizing the offer.
[3:07:46] <Profmcstevie> You come to bargain with me?! "you....you said to" .....I accept!
[3:07:48] <juggernaut246> its called Total War after all, not Total Negotiations
[3:08:06] <studleydoorite> who in this universe DOES care about money?
[3:08:15] <%notsoy> yes, he's raiding the ogre port
[3:08:18] <+RealThiele> Scientology: Cult successful!
[3:08:23] <zhenthrim213> they are.... indiffrent
[3:08:24] <+scarman125> I love the rivers of puss and shit that are forming in the land
[3:08:27] <bourgeoisdaemon> It takes a full turn to cross a river :(
[3:08:27] <%notsoy> crossing a river eats 50% of your movement range
[3:08:39] <studleydoorite> like everyone's either a space god or techno totalitarian
[3:08:39] <thepardack> @studleydoorite I assume like. dwarves and human folks at least do
[3:08:53] <juggernaut246> @studleydoorite Most Humans, Dwarves, Elves. Ogres
[3:08:59] <%MonsterEnvy> He was hidding remember
[3:08:59] <bourgeoisdaemon> He was invisible because he was ambushing
[3:09:01] <+SimplyRandy> @PatStaresAt they werre in "ambush" stance, which means you couldn't see them
[3:09:01] <kazadaz> Ogres, my lord
[3:09:06] <%maskofmichael> Your mom's house
[3:09:10] <+scarman125> they have a camp right there
[3:09:16] <studleydoorite> oh I thought this was 40K I'm dum
[3:09:17] <SaltyAzteca> Wildcard bitches, yeeeeeeee
[3:09:20] <%Chex868> those dwarvws coming for u
[3:09:22] <SpookyBeef7> Dwarces exist to be annoying. That's really it.
[3:09:34] <%notsoy> one way to "deal" with the dwarfs is to sit outside of the city in ambush stance (check the stances at the bottom left)
[3:09:35] <thepardack> dude you are lousy with ripped-ass dwarves
[3:09:57] <plaguedoctor_vi> @studleydoorite and a guy named balthasar gelt
[3:10:07] <%barkon345> Is this based in WarHammer fantasy or Dune aka 40k
[3:10:08] <+Totally_Not_Toby> were totally friends they're just sneaking out around our back door in the bushes we're friends though
[3:10:17] <huskarl_zap> map
[3:10:24] <thepardack> @barkon345 Warhammer Fantasy
[3:10:26] <%notsoy> winds of magic are calculated per-army
[3:10:46] <+queaks> maybe recruit a second army to defend?
[3:10:56] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:11:18] <%MonsterEnvy> A second army and some more plagueridden would be a good idea
[3:11:24] <tanarath> They're doing Friend Things, Pat, Don't Worry About It.
[3:11:26] <+SimplyRandy> THE DWORFS ARE COMIN
[3:11:29] <bourgeoisdaemon> lmao at the level of corruption, keeps spawning bonus armies at glut
[3:11:33] <zhenthrim213> pat is the most ornery nurgle follower ive ever seen
[3:11:33] <+Totally_Not_Toby> these ripped to shit dwarves are really just shitting up the place

[3:13:45] <%notsoy> no, 20 is the maximum you can possibly have
[3:13:48] <+SimplyRandy> you can stack 20
[3:13:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> you have 1, out of 20 max
[3:13:50] <%Valdorick> 1/20
[3:13:51] <%notsoy> the first number is how many you currently have

[3:13:52] <lloyddboy> availabe/max
[3:13:53] <bourgeoisdaemon> You have 1 available and 20 is the storage cap
[3:13:53] <%MonsterEnvy> You have 1 of the possible 20 in the pool
[3:13:53] <+JupiterDjin> Only have one in your pool
[3:14:00] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> 1/20

[3:14:09] <TheGesticulator> It's one available out of twenty.
[3:14:11] <funky_fen> Aren't the toads pretty good?
[3:14:12] <TheUglyNakWoo> i think thats the pools recruitment cap
[3:14:12] <%Valdorick> psaBlind
[3:14:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> nurgle is slow about everything
[3:14:19] <+eggstyr0ne> slow growth faction
[3:14:20] <+SimplyRandy> papa nurgle is slow & steady
[3:14:21] <%asgard147> the SLOW Faction
[3:14:23] <%notsoy> yeah nurgle is slow in all ways
[3:14:24] <klx5> nurgle is slow
[3:14:25] <Yomamma1337> well you dont have to recruit them
[3:14:31] <alexandus_> F in chat for Toxfarter
[3:14:35] <zhenthrim213> yes Nurgle is suppose to be the slow game
[3:14:39] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah you grow up slow, but the settlement garrisons are stronger than other factions, v good at defending territory you have
[3:14:40] <thepardack> F
[3:14:44] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah it's why it's good to set up millitary buildings ahead of time
[3:14:50] <Yomamma1337> i mean theres no recruit time
[3:14:58] <Yomamma1337> in response to you calling them slow
[3:15:00] <%notsoy> that army was spawned by a rebellion
[3:15:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> Rebels against Ogres!
[3:15:03] <%asgard147> CHAOS
[3:15:05] <%Valdorick> Its the other guy's
[3:15:07] <+gruff_gridof> different smells
[3:15:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt they happened because nurgle corruption got high in another province
[3:15:08] <%Valdorick> ignore them
[3:15:08] <%notsoy> when public order goes to -100, a rebellion happens
[3:15:09] <%MonsterEnvy> The Rebels on the ogres lands
[3:15:13] <+SimplyRandy> kugath is just one devotee of nurgle
[3:15:13] <kazadaz> They think the plague is a hoax (and they're pissed cause they want the plague)
[3:15:14] <+Marsantas> They like nurgle, just not you
[3:15:16] <Majiinbooh> you're worshiping Nurgle wrong
[3:15:17] <bourgeoisdaemon> Rebels are hostile to all
[3:15:18] <chaosbringer28> chaos groups fight each other constantly, even if they follow the same god
[3:15:19] <%legendfather_of_giants> rebels hate evryrbodyu
[3:15:20] <%notsoy> rebels are at war with everybody
[3:15:21] <%MonsterEnvy> That's just how rebels work
[3:15:21] <%Valdorick> They're hostile to EVERYONE
[3:15:27] <%notsoy> regardless of what type of army they actually happen to be

[3:15:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> they are prodistant pat
[3:15:35] <+p4ntless> They're very against the current pro-syphillis regime you've got going and would prefer things to be more gonorrhea focused

[3:15:41] <%Dakuu75> third party their ass
[3:15:42] <+Marsantas> I'd fight Zok
[3:15:42] <+RealThiele> the only people chaos hates the most is other chaos
[3:15:42] <%Valdorick> Kill them then take the town they're mad at.
[3:15:51] <+m3chamike> In Warhammer, a lot of Chaos factions have infighting because CHAOS
[3:15:56] <huskarl_zap> you need to go back to your settlements

[3:16:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> you have a preservation ALREAdy?
[3:16:45] <alexandus_> poggers
[3:16:46] <+JupiterDjin> Don't forget to plague yourself, for the children.
[3:16:53] <%notsoy> yeah, skills in that row are always good
[3:16:59] <zhenthrim213> @vaderxyz1970 this happens more often than it should
[3:17:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> final point in rancid is good
[3:17:05] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You can fuse and salvage items now
[3:17:26] <%Dakuu75> @JupiterDjin that's a sentence I never thought I'd read

[3:18:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> GREAT item for nurgle
[3:18:15] <%notsoy> your loot luck is pretty good so far lol
[3:18:29] <Visorak6> He's new
[3:18:30] <bourgeoisdaemon> He's more vulnerable
[3:18:37] <%notsoy> double-check your equipment, always
[3:18:38] <dan_g_v> hey chat peoples, how are the goblos going?
[3:18:48] <%Monkeyweed21> he's a melee character
[3:18:53] <Visorak6> When we're not beating each other over arguments
[3:18:54] <zhenthrim213> well like it
[3:18:54] <yyyyfdugyu> chat how is the game?
[3:18:55] <%cvp5127> pat stinks
[3:19:00] <bourgeoisdaemon> Kugath is near unkillable like he's got 15k hp and he's artillery
[3:19:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> We live to annoy and pester
[3:19:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> book of ashur is good on kugath
[3:19:11] <%MonsterEnvy> You should infect yourself to give an extra advantage
[3:19:18] <person181> send in the infected to weaken it
[3:19:22] <orochiblood> Pat Plaguefarter
[3:19:24] <%legendfather_of_giants> oh they have a fire wizard
[3:19:26] <alexandus_> manual fight?
[3:19:32] <%SharkMissile> Chat does Nurgle do good siege equipment?
[3:19:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> You can take this, you've got better magic on your hero
[3:19:35] <Visorak6> Yeah that's gonna be rough
[3:19:37] <%asgard147> psaGiefstare "My Apull"
[3:19:39] <Hawkthorne25> Replenish a bit, give them super AIDS, and then go in?
[3:19:45] <%notsoy> siege equipment is uniform across all races
[3:19:46] <@PrefectusCorgi> Nurglies are cheap
[3:19:46] <yyyyfdugyu> you should infect yourself NOW!!
[3:19:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[3:19:51] <huskarl_zap> kraka drak is going for your settlements
[3:19:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> YES
[3:19:52] <alexandus_> yes, high chance
[3:19:52] <+Marsantas> It can
[3:19:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[3:19:56] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes it has a chance of it
[3:19:56] <%notsoy> plagues CAN spread like that, yes
[3:19:57] <tntmen9> yes
[3:19:59] <%Bluwizard21> stinky agent
[3:20:01] <bourgeoisdaemon> But it'll take a turn
[3:20:02] <Yomamma1337> kinda shitty plague if not
[3:20:03] <+queaks> you can encircle then to attrition their forces
[3:20:05] <+vaderxyz1970> @sharkmissile Nurgle IS siege equipment
[3:20:07] <%notsoy> but it's only a chance, not guaranteed
[3:20:09] <Case_Ah_Dia> spread that stink
[3:20:10] <tntmen9> high chance of yes low chance of no
[3:20:12] <TechnicalCultist> offload the smells
[3:20:13] <%Dakuu75> this is like a monster version of Krew from Jak 2
[3:20:21] <Nikbottom> Probably
[3:20:21] <bourgeoisdaemon> Speed -10 is good cos you slow as FUCK
[3:20:24] <KneifEX> summon a cultist launches stink at people
[3:20:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> yes
[3:20:26] <alexandus_> middle one does attrition
[3:20:34] <%notsoy> attrition is probably better tbh, chip away at their numbers
[3:20:38] <orochiblood> 'i want palsy'
[3:20:46] <@PrefectusCorgi> and Fever
[3:20:54] <%notsoy> it does not spread instantly, FYI
[3:21:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> if you made a cultist, they would be sick now
[3:21:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> It's a classic tactic
[3:21:18] <%Monkeyweed21> just coughing on their front door
[3:21:25] <thepardack> the big fart cloud outside the window tactic
[3:21:30] <%Dakuu75> ...
[3:21:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> They will eventually be wiped
[3:21:33] <orochiblood> 'coughing on my room mates door'
[3:21:36] <Hawkthorne25> They can come out and attack.
[3:21:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> it takes some time tho
[3:21:40] <JetpackMcQuack> that's war
[3:21:43] <zhenthrim213> i would surrender
[3:21:53] <thepardack> just riddling the land with fart gas
[3:21:58] <kazadaz> I am so goddamn sick of these ogres
[3:22:04] <JetpackMcQuack> this seige is disgusting 🤮
[3:22:05] <+queaks> place second army in city
[3:22:07] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt why isnt the 2nd army garrisoned?
[3:22:09] <+Totally_Not_Toby> these dwarves are huge dicks
[3:22:10] <alexandus_> bad news bears
[3:22:13] <zhenthrim213> thts alot of warriors
[3:22:15] <Visorak6> That's a get the fucky wucky outta there
[3:22:18] <TheGesticulator> Yeah, not having a spare defensive army is a mistake you make when you start, and you only make it once.
[3:22:25] <Hawkthorne25> They spawn outside.
[3:22:27] <thepardack> uh oh
[3:22:35] <+vaderxyz1970> Is Nurgle pro or anti STD's since STD's get in the way of the life?
[3:22:41] <huskarl_zap> ignore that for no
[3:22:41] <kazadaz> When you make a new army, by default it appears 1 pixel outside the town
[3:22:44] <Hawkthorne25> Do not teleport to it.
[3:22:48] <%MonsterEnvy> Quest battle
[3:22:52] <Gelphaze> Its crunch TIME!
[3:22:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt quest battle for Kugath's unique equipment, leave that until you have a good army
[3:22:55] <bourgeoisdaemon> It's a quest battle
[3:23:04] <TechnicalCultist> teleport will send you back after the battle
[3:23:04] <Nikbottom> What did we ever do to you, Dwarfs?
[3:23:06] <+queaks> need a stronger army for that quest battle
[3:23:09] <zhenthrim213> you can do it whenever
[3:23:10] <%MonsterEnvy> It's something you can do later
[3:23:16] <kazadaz> There's no timer on that quest or anything, whenever you're ready
[3:23:44] <thepardack> more nurglings for the nurgling pile
[3:23:49] <thepardack> watch them giggle and dance
[3:23:51] <+queaks> maybe give moboth a plague
[3:23:52] <person181> OR come out and fight you WHILE they die
[3:23:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> that'll be like 10 turns @PatStaresAt
[3:24:02] <%notsoy> BTW the plague you created doesn't actually cause attrition
[3:24:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> They'll lose units to attrition every turn, check in to see if it's easier to attack.
[3:24:12] <zhenthrim213> yea this happens
[3:24:19] <%notsoy> LOL
[3:24:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> uh-oh
[3:24:24] <%asgard147> oh dear
[3:24:24] <alexandus_> oof
[3:24:24] <bourgeoisdaemon> RUDE
[3:24:25] <person181> OH NO
[3:24:26] <zhenthrim213> OOF
[3:24:27] <TechnicalCultist> Uh oh.

[3:24:32] <alexandus_> rip
[3:24:32] <Latija> THE ROYAL RUMBLE
[3:24:33] <KaiserMario> Do other factions get to lame it out like this or just the Nurgle lads?

[3:24:35] <kazadaz> maybe sit this out m'lord
[3:24:35] <thepardack> OH SHIT

[3:24:37] <+JupiterDjin> Ask and you shall receive.
[3:24:41] <+ryderbootz> uh oh spaghettyos
[3:24:45] <TheGesticulator> At lower difficulties, most other factions are doing nothing while one or two take over the entire rest of the world.
[3:24:45] <delerim001> TIME TO RUN
[3:24:46] <thepardack> RUN BITCH RUN
[3:24:47] <alexandus_> you got 'em sick successfully!

[3:24:50] <@PrefectusCorgi> Welcome to Warhammer Total War
[3:24:52] <orochiblood> I hate dwarves in this game dude, I make sure to wipe them out as soon as possible
[3:25:03] <lloyddboy> ORB
[3:25:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> T O A D S
[3:25:08] <TechnicalCultist> @KaiserMario other factions get to inflict attrition by besieging a settlement
[3:25:11] <%cvp5127> ORB
[3:25:13] <kazadaz> FROG FRACTIONS
[3:25:16] <person181> SICK ORB
[3:25:17] <+PharosOfLight> time to ponder the orb

[3:25:32] <%barrakuta371> psaBig psaOrb
[3:25:36] <Visorak6> Nurgle yo
[3:25:37] <+PharosOfLight> because your mouth is in your stomach?
[3:25:37] <%notsoy> it's chaos, don't question it
[3:25:39] <+ElectricHoodie> maybe it was like a jelly
[3:25:41] <KaiserMario> @TechnicalCultist thanks!
[3:25:41] <TheRelaxedOne> This is how I plant my trees :)
[3:25:44] <%asgard147> psaBig psaOrb
[3:25:45] <chaosbringer28> chaos mutations dawg
[3:25:45] <Visorak6> You got a mouth in your gut pat
[3:25:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> its chaos they don't have to explain shit
[3:25:46] <biglomix> mouth stomach
[3:25:48] <+Marsantas> nurgle ain't big on bones
[3:25:48] <taro_m> It came out of the belly mouth?
[3:25:49] <%Chex868> mate u have a massive stomach mouth
[3:25:52] <%Monkeyweed21> UNHINGE YOUR JAW
[3:25:54] <+vaderxyz1970> magic
[3:25:55] <whispersilk001> Nurgle Units are stretchy like that.
[3:25:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Its squishy
[3:25:59] <bourgeoisdaemon> DONT MERGE HE WRONG
[3:26:01] <Nikbottom> What even…?
[3:26:14] <alexandus_> don't merge!
[3:26:14] <zhenthrim213> NEVER MERGE
[3:26:25] <%notsoy> it's useful when in hostile territory where you can't replenish
[3:26:31] <bourgeoisdaemon> What stances can the army take?
[3:26:32] <TheGesticulator> It's really only good if you need to make space for better shit.
[3:26:35] <%Monkeyweed21> merging is bad as nurgle
[3:26:36] <%notsoy> then leave, no biggie
[3:26:40] <tntmen9> never merge
[3:26:44] <%MonsterEnvy> We need the dwarfs to get gone
[3:26:46] <%Chex868> run away build bigger army
[3:26:46] <kazadaz> Pull back and try to lure the dwarfs into a 1-on-1 fight I reckon
[3:26:48] <Hawkthorne25> Go home and attack with two armies?
[3:26:48] <bourgeoisdaemon> Park in the forest and ambush? Good chance
[3:26:49] <thepardack> yeah this shit is out of control
[3:26:55] <%notsoy> go home and clean out the ogres in your backyard
[3:26:58] <huskarl_zap> return to settlement
[3:27:00] <zhenthrim213> time to apply Joestar tech
[3:27:00] <%Monkeyweed21> you took way too long to secure your province, this happens
[3:27:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt conquer in the other direction for now?
[3:27:03] <tntmen9> run away and build a bigger army
[3:27:05] <thepardack> these dwarfs are too damn huge
[3:27:16] <bourgeoisdaemon> Careful you need 25% movement leftover to ambush
[3:27:18] <tntmen9> ambush could work
[3:27:25] <Nikbottom> Being chaos is hard
[3:27:31] <bourgeoisdaemon> Don't be too close
[3:27:31] <DeltaPangaea> Dorfs too DOUGHTY to get stinky.
[3:27:35] <%Chex868> even with ambush dwarves going to murder
[3:27:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt I think what really got you was accepting that 2-turn movement lock on like turn 3, it gave them time to build up
[3:27:46] <%notsoy> you need to leave and heal up
[3:27:47] <+eggstyr0ne> retreat have 2nd army reenforce
[3:27:48] <TechnicalCultist> some furies or something might be good in that army, mobility to shut down ranged units is nice
[3:27:49] <bourgeoisdaemon> You can win! You got magic
[3:28:01] <sheeperson34> encamp
[3:28:12] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> dworfs are super monsters
[3:28:17] <huskarl_zap> that drako port and occupy
[3:28:20] <kazadaz> You can probably beat all those armies, but not at the same time
[3:28:21] <bourgeoisdaemon> Move slightly further away to encamp
[3:28:32] <%notsoy> no, they're going to attack you again LOL
[3:28:38] <@PrefectusCorgi> They wont
[3:28:40] <tntmen9> LUL
[3:28:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> dorfs have spell resist tho
[3:28:48] <$scallycap> dwarves, known for giving up
[3:28:58] <sheeperson34> YOU CAN DO IT
[3:28:59] <TechnicalCultist> PYRRHIC VICTORY

[3:29:40] <bourgeoisdaemon> They aren't at war, they're neutral to each other, so they can team up on a mutual enemy
[3:29:40] <+Marsantas> They are neutral to each other but both hate you

[3:29:52] <tntmen9> they both hat you so they will fight together
[3:29:54] <%kujofire990> YOU ARE CHOAS
[3:29:56] <kazadaz> But thou musteth
[3:29:57] <%notsoy> should have left when you had the chance
[3:29:57] <joodatious> victory is victory
[3:29:58] <JetpackMcQuack> for the king
[3:30:01] <huskarl_zap> I said move back to the capital
[3:30:03] <+JupiterDjin> Pyrrhic, take the babby win
[3:30:03] <zhenthrim213> LETS GOOOOO
[3:30:05] <Latija> BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD
[3:30:09] <ThunderJim> for Frodo
[3:30:11] <%legendfather_of_giants> you're taking out tier 4 units of the dorfs that would be worth it
[3:30:12] <bourgeoisdaemon> You can win, abuse your magic
[3:30:13] <+scarman125> Ogres are a Neutral race they've fought alongside Dwarfs before in the lore. they'll fight with pretty much whoever pays them
[3:30:15] <Ardailec> Bro your hero's foot is the size of their leader, I think you got this
[3:30:16] <joodatious> nurglings cost nothing tho
[3:30:16] <juggernaut246> Destroy Them Pat!
[3:30:18] <%Valdorick> Pus for Pus Lord!
[3:30:18] <+ALazo> time to savescum
[3:30:22] <mar_krow> Make em sick
[3:30:24] <JetpackMcQuack> not great
[3:30:24] <Visorak6> This is gonna be rough
[3:30:26] <orochiblood> abuse all that magic you got
[3:30:26] <+ryderbootz> Kill em ALL! For Grandfather!
[3:30:27] <tntmen9> nurgle are tanky you still have a chance to win
[3:30:27] <Klarrann3> good luck lol
[3:30:31] <TheGesticulator> Godspeed, vomit man.
[3:30:32] <kazadaz> Okay so Dorfs are very slow.  They have a decent number of ranged units but not THAT many, and 1 piece of arty
[3:30:32] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> i would be very surprise if Pat wins this one
[3:30:34] <juggernaut246> ALRIGHT PAT
[3:30:36] <TechnicalCultist> that grudge thrower will be a problem but otherwise you can manage i think
[3:30:38] <Latija> keep kugath in the back shooting artillery
[3:30:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Oh hey a Gnarlmaw
[3:30:43] <darkodargon> nurgle treee
[3:30:46] <juggernaut246> RED MARKERS ARE WHERE THE REINFORCEMENTS ARE COMING FROM
[3:30:48] <%MonsterEnvy> They are blight Trees
[3:30:48] <zhenthrim213> is tht fucen miners with BLASTING CHARGES
[3:30:50] <+SimplyRandy> divide & conquer
[3:30:50] <%Monkeyweed21> early game momentum is really important, if you dont secure your starting province fast this is what happens
[3:30:54] <%emperordread> You go big guy
[3:30:55] <+scarman125> no you're right that's a tree
[3:30:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @kazadaz thunderers will murder all his good stuff tho
[3:30:55] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this is so fucked
[3:30:57] <huskarl_zap> use those rock choke points
[3:31:00] <+RabbiKing> Time to use ur big strong tactic brain to turn pyrrhic victory into a stomp
[3:31:03] <evbites> why would anyone invade the warp
[3:31:03] <JetpackMcQuack> one at a time
[3:31:03] <+Catpurnicus> yeah get the reinforcements first
[3:31:07] <bourgeoisdaemon> Hide a nurgling or two far to the side, then send them at the artillery once melee is engaged
[3:31:09] <RyuuAoi> Backdown
[3:31:11] <zhenthrim213> watch out for those miners pat
[3:31:20] <%MonsterEnvy> @evbites This is not the warp it's the Chaos Wastes
[3:31:45] <evbites> Same question
[3:31:51] <TechnicalCultist> oh damn Ku'gath has more range than i thought, he might be able to return fire on those grudge throwers
[3:32:01] <huskarl_zap> Demons are free I think so if you get wiped you can just recruit your other army right?
[3:32:02] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:32:07] <kazadaz> Don't overcomplicate this folks.  Pat: flank and tie up their ranged units, and your melee boys should be tough enough to outlast theirs
[3:32:07] <+CrustyAxon> reinforcements don't get there straight away?
[3:32:07] <%notsoy> tell kugath to shoot at the dwarfs
[3:32:19] <person181> oh no
[3:32:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt dwarfs have guns that will absolutely annihilate the nurgle beast and KuGath
[3:32:24] <Wolfstriker121> here they come
[3:32:24] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:32:26] <zhenthrim213> @TechnicalCultist yea he is an artilery piece
[3:32:27] <JetpackMcQuack> be quick
[3:32:31] <+ryderbootz> Dwarves are slow, you got time
[3:32:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> They are super slow th
[3:32:42] <TechnicalCultist> @zhenthrim213 i knew that, i just didn't think it was THAT long range
[3:32:43] <RyuuAoi> Time waits for no one.
[3:32:45] <%notsoy> stand on top of the edge of the map
[3:32:55] <bourgeoisdaemon> You got the range
[3:32:57] <JetpackMcQuack> that's ok
[3:32:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah take out their arty
[3:33:10] <bourgeoisdaemon> He's got a good throwin arm
[3:33:10] <+Catpurnicus> I thought nurgle had some healing ability for the troops
[3:33:13] <alexandus_> enemy reinforcements coming from your left flank
[3:33:16] <+OnTheDonner> I wish I had any skill whatsoever with these types of games
[3:33:23] <+Totally_Not_Toby> hahahahaha
[3:33:30] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[3:33:30] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this sucks, man
[3:33:35] <kazadaz> He knows about the reinforcements guys
[3:33:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah he's good versus infantry
[3:33:39] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah Kugath is busted
[3:33:39] <person181> spells?
[3:33:42] <zhenthrim213> might want to save his ammo
[3:33:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @person181 too far away
[3:34:01] <Wolfstriker121> holy shit!!
[3:34:02] <TechnicalCultist> @OnTheDonner Total War honestly probably isn't nearly as tough as something like StarCraft, it looks like a lot but he's only controlling 19 units
[3:34:06] <JetpackMcQuack> They're taking a choke point
[3:34:07] <person181> lame
[3:34:08] <kazadaz> COUNTERBATTERY FIRE
[3:34:08] <%emperordread> Myn the Harpoons
[3:34:09] <lloyddboy> no pat
[3:34:10] <RyuuAoi> I feel like you're out numbered, Pat.
[3:34:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> BOOK OF GRUDGES
[3:34:13] <JetpackMcQuack> Race them
[3:34:16] <%notsoy> they're here
[3:34:18] <lloyddboy> better to whittle down the infantry
[3:34:21] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Ok, where is the link that lets the company know I bought the game because Pat?
[3:34:24] <Klarrann3> good luck hitting a smaller target
[3:34:27] <%notsoy> CHARGE, you're way too far basck
[3:34:30] <tntmen9> he is outnumbered he is fighting three armies with one
[3:34:32] <zhenthrim213> time to charge
[3:34:36] <Latija> @TechnicalCultist nurgle is a slow faction, faster factions need good micro
[3:34:41] <tntmen9> CHARGE
[3:34:43] <%CalderGaming> !sponsored
[3:34:44] <JetpackMcQuack> here we go boid
[3:34:45] <huskarl_zap> downhill charge is good
[3:34:47] <alexandus_> kill 'em before you get pincered
[3:34:55] <%CalderGaming> nope that doesn't work
[3:34:56] <bourgeoisdaemon> Use the new spell!
[3:34:56] <Visorak6> spells time
[3:34:59] <Nikbottom> This is bad huh?
[3:35:05] <taro_m> use magic
[3:35:06] <Happy_Acciden> start praying
[3:35:09] <bourgeoisdaemon> On hero
[3:35:10] <JetpackMcQuack> now that's a horde
[3:35:11] <zhenthrim213> if you get pincered by dwarfs your done
[3:35:11] <%notsoy> on the hero
[3:35:12] <%legendfather_of_giants> Rancid on the other wizard
[3:35:15] <tntmen9> open fire at the artiliery
[3:35:16] <lloyddboy> TIDE THE CATAPULTS
[3:35:16] <+scarman125> Nurgle doesn't do fast
[3:35:17] <%MonsterEnvy> The Plague Ridden has it
[3:35:18] <%notsoy> the hero has rancid
[3:35:26] <kazadaz> Dwarves have kinda shitty melee damage, so you can hold back their line with a couple units for a while
[3:35:27] <Visorak6> rancid their wizard
[3:35:30] <TechnicalCultist> @Latija for sure, i play beastmen and am planning on playing the hell out of Slaanesh but i still have a way easier time doing micro in this game than SC and i've been playing that for a way longer time
[3:35:30] <sheeperson34> nurgle units get a bonus in melee
[3:35:38] <lloyddboy> NOOOO
[3:35:40] <huskarl_zap> thats for single entities
[3:35:43] <%notsoy> cast it on the lord, not on gnoblars
[3:35:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> on the general, not gnoblars
[3:35:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Yeah, looks ok
[3:35:48] <lloyddboy> pat that's for single targets
[3:35:51] <Visorak6> dont rancid their troops!
[3:36:08] <JetpackMcQuack> just add prayer
[3:36:17] <evbites> the battle of armies
[3:36:18] <Visorak6> He has to cast
[3:36:18] <zhenthrim213> these are the fights I LIVE FOR
[3:36:21] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this blows man this is just a bad situation all around
[3:36:23] <evbites> four
[3:36:24] <+Marsantas> Pat he can't shiit the arty, the trees are blocking his shots
[3:36:27] <huskarl_zap> oh fuck mournfang
[3:36:29] <taro_m> the wedge spell is best cast from the side, along the enemy lines for maximum damage
[3:36:31] <%MonsterEnvy> Kugath can shoot and cast at the same time
[3:36:32] <+saltpiggu> oh man they just flop
[3:36:40] <+SimplyRandy> at least you don't have to fight all of them at once
[3:36:41] <+OnTheDonner> @TechnicalCultist Having to make units to counter others, when you aren't sure what they have, just gives me choice paralysis, making me default to one of two units. Plus add on the whole formation and actual military tactics ontop of that
[3:36:44] <Wolfstriker121> this is not good
[3:36:45] <tntmen9> this is not good
[3:36:49] <Yomamma1337> hit em with the wedge
[3:36:50] <%emperordread> Retreaaat
[3:36:52] <alexandus_> they're all bunched up for your artillary
[3:36:55] <Klarrann3> and that's game
[3:36:58] <Happy_Acciden> this is very not good
[3:37:02] <%MonsterEnvy> Have Kugath cast
[3:37:04] <tntmen9> very few plants
[3:37:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> Good if they shoot at kugath
[3:37:06] <+SimplyRandy> BIG SPELLS
[3:37:06] <huskarl_zap> chokepoint in the back right of the map
[3:37:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> keep casting
[3:37:08] <%strakillias> Use spells
[3:37:09] <+Marsantas> If you had rushed the dwarves first maybe?
[3:37:11] <JetpackMcQuack> the planet of statistics
[3:37:13] <+ALazo> In the planet you auto-resolved I guess
[3:37:17] <%Valdorick> With the power of Magic and Cheese!
[3:37:18] <tntmen9> pretty sure this is a lost cause at this point
[3:37:18] <tanarath> Restart & engage in a better location/earlier
[3:37:20] <kazadaz> It looks like the dwarves are hanging back til their catapult uses all its ammo, which is good for you
[3:37:28] <%fanciful_fright> Only reason it was Pyrrhic Victory is because Nurgle is weighted higher in autoresolve
[3:37:31] <+SimplyRandy> pat use your nurgle spell
[3:37:32] <bourgeoisdaemon> Every cast heals your army
[3:37:37] <+sermittens> FLANK
[3:37:39] <Happy_Acciden> outswaggered
[3:37:40] <%MonsterEnvy> Use Army ability and summon your nurglings
[3:37:44] <Visorak6> keep casting
[3:37:46] <sheeperson34> rip
[3:37:46] <alexandus_> they're flee out of the battle
[3:37:47] <Yomamma1337> most of your units arent attacking
[3:37:48] <%MonsterEnvy> And remember casting heals
[3:37:50] <+saltpiggu> time to reload!
[3:37:51] <@PrefectusCorgi> Your will Heal your troops
[3:37:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt you heal while casting
[3:37:52] <+Rofiarf> cast spells to trigger the passive heal
[3:37:54] <alexandus_> focus on breaking individual units and chasing them out
[3:37:56] <kazadaz> The ogres... they're vaxxed...
[3:38:02] <TechnicalCultist> @OnTheDonner you can make a balanced army that can deal with any or most situations, most races also specialize in a certain playstyle that you can prepare for. dwarfs have no mobility but sturdy masses of infantry and lots of ranged firepower for example
[3:38:06] <huskarl_zap> plaggue bearers are winning odd
[3:38:10] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Most of the units are just sitting around
[3:38:11] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Use the Joestar Secret technquie that's been passed for generations
[3:38:14] <Happy_Acciden> L + ratio moment
[3:38:14] <Yomamma1337> you need to order your units to fight their
[3:38:17] <Yomamma1337> theirs*
[3:38:19] <alexandus_> see yeah balance of power is improving
[3:38:25] <JetpackMcQuack> Team A did OK
[3:38:25] <+SimplyRandy> Pat what is the spell on the right of yourt screen above the magic?
[3:38:25] <bourgeoisdaemon> They're breaking, keep going
[3:38:27] <huskarl_zap> ogres lose to bearers huh
[3:38:28] <zhenthrim213> wow your scattering the ogres
[3:38:28] <+scarman125> the Dwarfs don't seem to give a shit what happens to the Ogres
[3:38:33] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Don't forget about summoning exploding nurglings
[3:38:38] <kazadaz> All the units with ZZZs on their cards are currently idle
[3:38:49] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt your Balance of power bar is going up, you're actually doing well
[3:38:52] <%SodiumPatrol> i wish i was good at this to understand wtf is going on lol
[3:38:54] <+OnTheDonner> @TechnicalCultist Maybe I'll try out Total Warhammer 2. I picked it up once but only played for about 50 min
[3:39:01] <JetpackMcQuack> Recombine and roll em
[3:39:05] <Gelphaze> The Ogres are going to eat you Pat!
[3:39:10] <bourgeoisdaemon> Get the monsters in
[3:39:18] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You also have the army ability
[3:39:20] <huskarl_zap> the bearers do work
[3:39:26] <+scarman125> what does his army ability do?
[3:39:26] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it sure couldve gone worse so far
[3:39:32] <kazadaz> You're turnin it around man
[3:39:33] <darkodargon> You can do it pat
[3:39:51] <zhenthrim213> THERE RUNNIN
[3:39:51] <TechnicalCultist> @OnTheDonner high elves or lizardmen are a great starting race, high elves are very versatile and basic with a strong economy, lizardmen don't have an amazing economy but are also versatile and fairly easy to play
[3:39:54] <+saltpiggu> you got this!
[3:39:55] <JetpackMcQuack> this games so fucking rad
[3:39:55] <%notsoy> rancid on the enemy lord
[3:39:57] <%legendfather_of_giants> pop down a rancid on the general
[3:39:59] <kazadaz> Everyone cough if you believe in Nurgles
[3:40:00] <+saltpiggu> just kite and cast spells!
[3:40:05] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You just need to deal with the dworf army next
[3:40:16] <+saltpiggu> yeah their fleein!
[3:40:18] <%MonsterEnvy> Use the Hero spell on the enemy lord to damage him
[3:40:18] <Parapattern> Can't mansplain, manipulate, or  manwhore my way out of this one, boys.
[3:40:19] <JetpackMcQuack> That hill is officially a problem
[3:40:20] <tntmen9> still could beat the dwarfs
[3:40:23] <%notsoy> nurgle? kite? lmfao
[3:40:29] <JetpackMcQuack> YEAH
[3:40:30] <darkodargon> honestly cant he just run out the clock and hang back
[3:40:32] <tntmen9> might still be able to win this
[3:40:33] <+scarman125> poop wind
[3:40:34] <kazadaz> Adieu to the nurglings, but dying is what they were made for
[3:40:38] <%legendfather_of_giants> this could beat those dorfs, they're all AP
[3:40:39] <JetpackMcQuack> Won the battle
[3:40:41] <jetjagger222> was that literal fart gas
[3:40:42] <+OnTheDonner> @TechnicalCultist Thanks, man. I'll try that out. I forget which race I picked, but probly went for the one that looks cool. Probly the hardest race to play
[3:40:42] <tntmen9> nurgle can't kite they are too slow
[3:40:43] <bourgeoisdaemon> So far only nurglings have really died
[3:40:46] <+saltpiggu> give them the blob
[3:41:05] <Nikbottom> That’s a sick gamer chair
[3:41:10] <%emperordread> Kill him and eat his bones
[3:41:12] <%notsoy> time to go kill the dorfs
[3:41:13] <kazadaz> Army ability is ready again
[3:41:14] <+ryderbootz> Dude you've totally got this
[3:41:14] <+ElectricHoodie> dwarves just vibin
[3:41:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> Baance of power says you're even with the dwarves
[3:41:26] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ogres done! Get those dwarfs, make sure you get monsters on top of ranged units and you can take this
[3:41:28] <thepardack> Kugath and his big gamer chair are doin it
[3:41:29] <+lordericter> I think you lost more than the auto resolve was going to take and this battle is only half over
[3:41:30] <%notsoy> bumrush the dwarfs now, don't redeploy
[3:41:34] <JetpackMcQuack> so this thing
[3:41:39] <zhenthrim213> THEY HAVE CHARGES
[3:41:42] <%MonsterEnvy> Kugath is out of amy
[3:41:46] <taro_m> I miss the times where Total War games had tactics rather than just blobbing the enemy
[3:41:50] <JetpackMcQuack> let's go to the right
[3:41:51] <lloyddboy> summon a unit on em
[3:41:52] <%emperordread> artillery is running out of ammo, you can take it easy
[3:41:57] <TechnicalCultist> @OnTheDonner NP! skaven with no DLC are kinda not great and even with DLC can be hard if you're new to this sort of game, i started with them and had a hard time
[3:42:03] <bourgeoisdaemon> dw about artillery
[3:42:14] <tntmen9> now is the time to strike
[3:42:23] <+Totally_Not_Toby> this is wacky
[3:42:35] <JetpackMcQuack> hit that corner like hell
[3:42:36] <Visorak6> YOu should be fine as long as you dont charge uphill
[3:42:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> most of their units are armor-piercing, and you don't have much armor, which is good
[3:42:44] <taro_m> What's the spell on the right above the magic?
[3:42:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> Get the guns and the bows in melee and they're cooked
[3:42:53] <kazadaz> The dwarves are such assholes, just watching the ogres get demolished
[3:43:01] <Visorak6> Theyre spinning
[3:43:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt once they're out of artillery ammo they'll charge you
[3:43:03] <%notsoy> army-wide ability
[3:43:04] <zhenthrim213> there repostioning
[3:43:04] <Visorak6> Not running
[3:43:05] <+saltpiggu> oh crap theres more of them
[3:43:07] <%MonsterEnvy> @kazadaz They are not actual allies
[3:43:11] <JetpackMcQuack> fucking squares
[3:43:24] <lloyddboy> frogs gettin pelted
[3:43:32] <%Valdorick> Ironically, so far, pat has only lost units the auto resolve said he would.
[3:43:48] <+Rofiarf> there were units that you didn't have line of vision on
[3:43:51] <bourgeoisdaemon> The ranged units will slaughter you, the beast and Kugath must melee them, push through
[3:43:56] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to use the army ability once you engage the dwarfs
[3:44:00] <+saltpiggu> heal if you can
[3:44:01] <JetpackMcQuack> I ssee a lot of melee
[3:44:15] <JetpackMcQuack> fuck
[3:44:20] <JetpackMcQuack> LUL
[3:44:22] <Visorak6> Yeah you should be casting and getting into melee ASAP
[3:44:27] <bourgeoisdaemon> Use all magic, everything to kill ranged units
[3:44:30] <zhenthrim213> the dance
[3:44:33] <+ElectricHoodie> wow hacks, turning to face your enemy
[3:44:33] <evbites> damn dwarves and thier iron wall

[3:44:46] <RyuuAoi> Here we go

[3:46:24] <%notsoy> blew it way too early
[3:46:28] <bourgeoisdaemon> Exclamation points are colour coded for threat level
[3:46:29] <@PrefectusCorgi> Bad match up
[3:46:31] <+RoeDeerRootie> the color of the exclimation points in their danger relative to your selected unit
[3:46:35] <420moneymoney69> I would love to be able to get into this game but I have absolutely no idea wtf is going on

[3:47:20] <+TAFK> gotta get someone to that back line pat
[3:47:21] <bourgeoisdaemon> Charge them
[3:47:22] <kazadaz> Kugath can just charge the guns
[3:47:29] <Visorak6> Kugath is getting melted
[3:47:32] <funky_fen> missiles are STRONG in this game
[3:47:33] <%Chichen> welp
[3:47:35] <bourgeoisdaemon> Big boys can push thru
[3:47:39] <Latija> push kugath through
[3:47:39] <+nwatts1999> Don’t forget abilities on lords

[3:48:01] <%SodiumPatrol> ifcMagnush ifcEmd ifcEmd2 zyzxSHOOK
[3:48:05] <%Monkeyweed21> big boi means big target
[3:48:10] <delerim001> there goes kugath
[3:48:15] <%Caped_Eggy> Oh they switch target
[3:48:16] <tntmen9> this is bad
[3:48:18] <+Rofiarf> hahaha
[3:48:18] <jetjagger222> dorfs are super tough head to head
[3:48:22] <%Caped_Eggy> LUL
[3:48:23] <JetpackMcQuack> keep pushing the quad
[3:48:24] <Yomamma1337> lol
[3:48:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> it hit your own troops
[3:48:27] <kazadaz> yeah it whiffed
[3:48:28] <JetpackMcQuack> squad
[3:48:30] <+saltpiggu> didnt have a clear shot
[3:48:31] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you just fired balled you lord
[3:48:34] <@PrefectusCorgi> He Missed LUL
[3:48:36] <%MonsterEnvy> Guns are bad for you
[3:48:37] <bourgeoisdaemon> Unfortunate loss, you have to melee the ranged units
[3:48:38] <%SodiumPatrol> GGs?
[3:48:42] <funky_fen> thunderers are high damage
[3:48:43] <Wolfstriker121> good try tho
[3:48:46] <Yomamma1337> you saved, so you can retry if you want
[3:48:47] <Mister_McDerp> RIP
[3:48:49] <JetpackMcQuack> but we had fun
[3:49:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> honestly, you almost won, I couldn't do that my first few campaigns @PatStaresAt
[3:49:04] <bourgeoisdaemon> RIP, take the pyhrric instead
[3:49:05] <+ElectricHoodie> I would love to see Kugath be "carried from the field"
[3:49:06] <%Valdorick> Dwarves are uh... a problem early game.
[3:49:09] <+ryderbootz> weaalp
[3:49:15] <evbites> pat it's over
[3:49:15] <delerim001> should have taken that auto victory
[3:49:16] <kazadaz> We beat the plague everyone!  Lockdon's finally over!
[3:49:19] <bourgeoisdaemon> keep mashing attack orders
[3:49:21] <%luftraumm1> either back down or retry honestly
[3:49:23] <%Monkeyweed21> army loses is about to kick in
[3:49:26] <+saltpiggu> yeah its often good to send big mobile monsters into the back line
[3:49:28] <jetjagger222> nurgle doesn't like ranged
[3:49:30] <+TAFK> you handled all the melee guys pretty well, just needed to get to their ranged ones
[3:49:32] <darkodargon> oof
[3:49:33] <@PrefectusCorgi> LUL
[3:49:35] <%emperordread> filthy campers
[3:49:36] <%SodiumPatrol> Gun OP
[3:49:38] <darkodargon> Good try pat
[3:49:41] <tntmen9> the beast of nurgles are very tanky
[3:49:41] <+scarman125> that's daemons for you
[3:49:43] <+afrodood> Did Pat forget the Beast?
[3:49:54] <@PrefectusCorgi> Should Have done Autoreslove
[3:49:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah you did GREAT
[3:49:56] <%projectmanatees> How bad or good is pat playing
[3:49:57] <Klarrann3> should have used more of those wind spells on the ranged units
[3:50:01] <+scarman125> honestly that was a good fucking try. that battle was tough as hell
[3:50:02] <kazadaz> Combined Arms
[3:50:06] <tntmen9> time to build a new army
[3:50:07] <@Ranryu692> is that good?
[3:50:08] <bourgeoisdaemon> Ah that sucks, but yeah big monsters can push through the front and get to the backline shooters
[3:50:09] <%Valdorick> Guns and high armor in the early game. Dwarves got it all right at the beginning
[3:50:11] <Visorak6> You did well the biggest issue is kugath shouldve just bowled right into their backline immediately
[3:50:12] <%notsoy> autoresolve would, in fact, have given a better result, damn
[3:50:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @projectmanatees For how long he's been playing, actually really good
[3:50:14] <Mister_McDerp> Nurgle is literally hard countered by missile infantry, it was a good try
[3:50:14] <%terrorengine> Slow clap
[3:50:15] <+SimplyRandy> to be fair it was a tough fight
[3:50:17] <funky_fen> @projectmanatees Decent
[3:50:17] <zhenthrim213> Kislev or Cathy would be your faction then
[3:50:18] <+Ataraxis9> That looked good
[3:50:19] <+JupiterDjin> Now reload and take the pyrric victory
[3:50:23] <tntmen9> the whole army is gone
[3:50:27] <%BinaryFireball> i want to make fun of you but this game hard
[3:50:29] <+RealThiele> you died but it was cool
[3:50:30] <kazadaz> They'll probably all die of plague eventually
[3:50:31] <%kyh9> The disgusting fart monsters fought…VALIANTLY
[3:50:31] <JetpackMcQuack> ye
[3:50:38] <+lordericter> shoulda auto resolved I guess
[3:50:40] <EynoStiles> What genre is this?
[3:50:44] <+saltpiggu> yeah but you routed a lot
[3:50:50] <jetjagger222> that's a really bad result
[3:50:55] <+TAFK> positive KDR!
[3:50:59] <kazadaz> It's a hybrid Turn-based/Real-time strategy
[3:51:01] <%Caped_Eggy> Them
[3:51:01] <%BinaryFireball> khorne
[3:51:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> i mean you have a backup army too
[3:51:02] <evbites> WAR OF ATRITION
[3:51:02] <%baka_sugoi> the long con
[3:51:03] <sheeperson34> them
[3:51:04] <$SGrim> Them.
[3:51:05] <person181> still not you
[3:51:05] <%luftraumm1> they are
[3:51:05] <%BinaryFireball> khorne always wins
[3:51:06] <taro_m> Maybe you should have left some units behind and have the dorfs wheel around exposing their backline to you
[3:51:06] <@PrefectusCorgi> Not You
[3:51:06] <funky_fen> @EynoStiles fantasy tactics
[3:51:07] <RyuuAoi> No one
[3:51:08] <sheeperson34> no
[3:51:09] <%Valdorick> LUL
[3:51:10] <+Mrbaconator> you have more blood on your face making you the victor
[3:51:11] <+p4ntless> it's okay Nurgle is still very proud of you for doing your best
[3:51:16] <%Monkeyweed21> the big mistake was probably taking too long to secure your first province
[3:51:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt also Tzeentch is the ranged kings
[3:51:19] <kazadaz> Suka blyat
[3:51:19] <+ninjabush> yay orger boys
[3:51:21] <%terrorengine> vampire counts?
[3:51:24] <evbites> wraith pat
[3:51:26] <sheeperson34> yeah you look white as hell
[3:51:26] <bourgeoisdaemon> All for Papa Nurgle!
[3:51:30] <%terrorengine> vampire counts
[3:51:31] <Mister_McDerp> time for archer spam
[3:51:33] <RyuuAoi> Pat uncalibrated ha tv.
[3:51:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> and they have protoss shields
[3:51:40] <+RealThiele> gamma big up
[3:51:41] <Happy_Acciden> ghost mode
[3:51:57] <kazadaz> And they're fast enough to run away
[3:51:58] <klx5> yeah that sounds like tzeentch
[3:51:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah BOTH of those hard-counter Nurgle
[3:52:01] <%MegboyManuel> MegboyManuel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 38 months! pat how would you feel about a mouthful paige art where she vores big things
[3:52:10] <%barkon345> is the sound tracking of for anyone else?
[3:52:14] <%barkon345> off
[3:52:16] <moodkilla115> Pretty micro heavy faction tho
[3:52:18] <jetjagger222> just as planned
[3:52:26] <kazadaz> Tzeentch has a campaign ability that lets you give one person's city to another person
[3:52:29] <Happy_Acciden> sound is fine for me
[3:52:37] <%maskofmichael> thing don't work, ask paige for help
[3:52:38] <Gelphaze> YEAH Ogres Pat! can't wait!
[3:52:48] <%legendfather_of_giants> now mod it to shit
[3:52:49] <%Valdorick> Pat! Do you have an affiliate Link!?
[3:52:50] <%Monkeyweed21> Tzeentch counters Nurgle, Nurgle counters Khorne, Khorne counters Slaneesh, Slaneesh counters Tzeentch
[3:52:53] <+Rofiarf> yeah
[3:52:57] <%BinaryFireball> khorne bb
[3:52:59] <%hermitsen> any factions from 1/2 you would want to go back to?
[3:53:01] <zhenthrim213> Khnorne is awsome
[3:53:02] <orochiblood> Tzeentch time
[3:53:03] <+ryderbootz> Will do! as soon as that new pc comes in, i swear
[3:53:05] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yeah it was a good run, even that loss was dealable
[3:53:06] <%notsoy> nurgle's buildings are weird
[3:53:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah nurgle is a hard start, Kislev and Cathay would be easier
[3:53:09] <jetjagger222> play empire lol
[3:53:11] <+Mrbaconator> khorne is rock rock always wins
[3:53:14] <+scarman125> Nurgle is a rough faction to play by all accounts
[3:53:15] <%notsoy> ikit claw is fun as hell
[3:53:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Nurgle is the big snowball faction so they have the hardest start by far
[3:53:16] <zhenthrim213> YES-YES
[3:53:19] <funky_fen> You would probably love Ikit Claw
[3:53:26] <+ryderbootz> Skaven is super fun
[3:53:30] <%Valdorick> Skaven are the best "I just never want my enemy to reach me" faction.
[3:53:35] <%notsoy> nobody doesn't love ikit claw
[3:53:37] <+Rofiarf> ikit claw gets nukes
[3:53:38] <+m3chamike> YEAH THE FUCKIN RATBOIS LETS GOOOOO
[3:53:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt the big Skaven faction then is Skryre from the Prophet and Warlock DLC
[3:53:44] <bourgeoisdaemon> Yep
[3:53:46] <jetjagger222> skaven is all about cheating
[3:53:47] <zhenthrim213> YUP
[3:53:47] <Onamar> yeah skaven are busted
[3:53:49] <kazadaz> Skaven are the Imperial Guard of fantasy
[3:53:50] <Klarrann3> yeah, it's the best
[3:53:51] <Latija> that's right
[3:53:52] <%notsoy> no, they're about guns and more guns
[3:53:53] <%SharkMissile> Live to die
[3:53:53] <Yomamma1337> some of the lords arent but mostly
[3:53:54] <bourgeoisdaemon> Even skaven elite infantry are still garbage
[3:53:57] <+Macmo696> Don't forget the warpstone nukes
[3:53:57] <%Valdorick> Yeah, you replace your front line with Plague Monks who summon Clan Rats that don't mean anything!
[3:53:59] <+p4ntless> basically, they also have good magic and monster options
[3:54:00] <bullprophet> ikit is literally that. chuck trash up front to hold enemy long enough for your gunners to SHRED them
[3:54:01] <$zyberion626> sounds like you're an Empire/Dwarf man Pat
[3:54:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Ogre gunners have artillery range cuz their guns are literally handheld cannons
[3:54:12] <kazadaz> and Ikit Claw is the shootiest Skaven lord
[3:54:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> skaven elite infantry are worse than their early infantry
[3:54:16] <%strakillias> Not all artillery. There is also Ratling guns
[3:54:17] <%emperordread> Skaven also have a unique warren mechanic for corrupting towns
[3:54:19] <zhenthrim213> cant friendly fire if they arent freinds
[3:54:20] <bourgeoisdaemon> OGRES MILORD
[3:54:32] <+demon1103> problem I face is the "starter" classes are ones I don't want to play. I want smelly Nurgle maybe murder happy Khorne (would have like Ogres but day 1 dlc, so no on gamepasss)
[3:54:54] <Tunamanguy> i just want mortal empires mode
[3:54:59] <Latija> and chaos undivided
[3:55:03] <inksmears> LUL
[3:55:07] <mrtanaka111> !
[3:55:07] <%SharkMissile> LUL
[3:55:09] <%Monkeyweed21> Khorne is stupid busted its hilarious
[3:55:13] <%cvp5127> coward
[3:55:14] <+p4ntless> skaven also have chemical weapons, sniper rifles and miniguns, and it all rounds up on ground up magic crack
[3:55:14] <%MegboyManuel> meg
[3:55:15] <%SharkMissile> Paige will love it
[3:55:17] <RyuuAoi> Ha
[3:55:22] <%Valdorick> RIP Archon the Neverchosen. Deamon Prince is just Warriors of Chaos but better.
[3:55:23] <+RowenCleric> how is chaos undivided different from the other 4
[3:55:24] <kazadaz> Actual Meg from Family Guy
[3:55:25] <%MegboyManuel> stop telling vel to fuck off
