[0:12:04] <mr_slaide> Why is Elmo so great?
[0:12:05] <%Solidus_113> December 11th is the very first stream you did, with FF15. the video is on the SBFP channel @AngriestPat
[0:12:06] <%Remery_> How dare you clash with Woolie's stream? You Whore!
[0:12:07] <FoulNightingale> RAFFLE HARDER
[0:12:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @AngriestPat I remember it was mid-december, it was a patch notes for ff14

[0:12:14] <WeedSpagon> DS2 feels floaty
[0:12:15] <%MaiHusbando9S> i hate when it feels loose

[0:12:25] <PsychoFlash1> @WeedSpagon yeah exactly
[0:12:25] <@Moobot> Added one or more users to the raffle
[0:12:29] <cizal11> ds2's movement is really awful
[0:12:29] <%tyler274> paaaattttt
[0:12:29] <+Buytoast> DS2 feels like all the animations were made by just tweening everything
[0:12:30] <$GohanEgret> so it's Brawl
[0:12:31] <flamearch13> elffar!
[0:12:32] <+noboruian> even ds1 "feels" way better
[0:12:33] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat I miss the build verity tho
[0:12:34] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> DS2 is kinda shit but at least it tried SOME things new. I feel like DS3 relies on things from the past games WAY too much
[0:12:35] <valriot> feels like the game is just hitboxes
[0:12:35] <%umbypokochan> i like it, it's like dancing
[0:12:37] <NYCrownlessKing> we need matt streaming so we got the quad-fecta of streams

[0:12:44] <mr_slaide> Fuggins, who's the best sailor scout and why is it Mercury?
[0:12:46] <atlas5057> DS2 feels like a fever dream after you got the flu playing DS1
[0:12:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Paige's two years was the first week of november on twitch, but I think her periscope things were as far back as september
[0:12:47] <%MaiHusbando9S> the thunkest
[0:12:51] <+wynnewake> that's a weird fetish
[0:12:52] <ArtThouBored> Bloodeborne or DS3 for your second favorite?
[0:12:53] <NYCrownlessKing> thats only cuz it had to fix shit that ds2 did @PlayKingdomHeartsGames
[0:12:57] <thatwaulfyguy> Watched a video that said ds2 movement is essentially locked on cardinal directions
[0:12:59] <Duskers> THE THUNK
[0:13:00] <@Fuggins4U> @mr_slaide Look at me. I am the sailor scout now.
[0:13:02] <onlyglaric> Ooh nice
[0:13:03] <%Paralurx> the THUNKENING
[0:13:04] <thatwaulfyguy> pretty weird

[0:13:05] <Duskers> Thonk

[0:13:12] <Run44forrest> think ds2 is my favorite souls game

[0:13:43] <mr_slaide> Paige is dead.
[0:13:43] <PsychoFlash1> DS2 is overhated AF, worst souls game but still great
[0:13:44] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> whenever 2 was referencing the first game it was shit
[0:13:44] <%SaltyDongs> PAT WOOLIE WAS STREAMING AND HE MADE US CALL HIM DADDY

[0:13:50] <@Fuggins4U> hamdruff
[0:13:54] <Darmarock> DS2 is great, but still worse than the rest
[0:13:55] <Worldbrand> Vordt's flaky ball dandruff
[0:13:57] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> and thats all 3 does, Plays better tho
[0:14:00] <+MahoganyVince> Pat did you already comment somewhere on Fallout 76 already being on sale for $35? Cause I really wanna know your reaction to that
[0:14:02] <+Ssaik> DS2 is bad
[0:14:03] <%BAGGETTA> winter scalp itch is real
[0:14:06] <+Buytoast> did you ever do rat king covenant shinanigans in DS2?
[0:14:07] <TheBlankAce> Well Vordt went mad because of dandruff thats canon now
[0:14:07] <+Ssaik> >:(
[0:14:07] <mr_slaide> Fallout 76 sucks.
[0:14:07] <%Solidus_113> I'm drinking crown royal and coke tonight apatDab
[0:14:09] <OwlLightningMage> Pat literally just past Woolie in viewers. Suck it Woolie
[0:14:10] <Calek> I'd rather play DS2 over DS3

[0:14:15] <RCtiger0> He can make a dandruff snowman
[0:14:16] <%FrostMass22> @saltydongs Woolie took the Father Woolie bit too seriously
[0:14:18] <$GohanEgret> LUL
[0:14:22] <%umbypokochan> the fact that I actually beat DS2 means it must be good because damn it was hard
[0:14:22] <PsychoFlash1> LUL
[0:14:25] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> Demon's still has the best bosses dont or do @ me
[0:14:27] <bsmusic> LUL
[0:14:28] <%Your_Friendly_Futa> Did I do the thing? Ive never subbed before
[0:14:34] <@Fuggins4U> yay
[0:14:38] <PsychoFlash1> @umbypokochan well, it is the easiest souls game by a landslide
[0:14:39] <$TenderBabyBacon> cheer200 Pat, you got me back into Warframe lately, and just a reminder that the younger and more innocent the animal, the tastier the food that comes from it
[0:14:42] <Chumblago13> I think it comes down to preference. I genuinely like humanoid enemies and the feel of DS2. but all the Souls games are good in their own way.
[0:14:43] <KoyaMusa> @PlayKingdomHeartsGames leechmonger
[0:14:45] <MattyPOnTheRoad> oh hi @angriestpat
[0:14:46] <+megaotter> DS2 and DS3 have their pros and cons each..
[0:14:57] <snake_zen> @FrostMass22 we chose to start that not him
[0:14:58] <+Ssaik> the internet
[0:14:58] <%Metballs> Bother Mothman
[0:15:03] <WeedSpagon> I hope we get a character in Sekiro called 'Yurtrec, Chief of Carim'.
[0:15:03] <captainthunderwolf> MiniWarGaming probably has some templets.
[0:15:04] <%Metballs> He's a nerd for that
[0:15:05] <whimsicallifestyle> is elmo there
[0:15:05] <%AncelDeLambert> Wattup losers, let's all ditch and go watch Woolie
[0:15:07] <+D4C_Trice> I've quit DS2 4 times due to getting bored
[0:15:08] <NYCrownlessKing> u forget though the game just had terrible bosses @PlayKingdomHeartsGames and none were even unique or entertaining new monster types, story differences or not.
[0:15:09] <%umbypokochan> @PsychoFlash1 I thought the first one was easier, though i stopped half way through because i lost interest
[0:15:11] <bsmusic> @playkingdomheartsgames Adjudicator
[0:15:11] <+NWR_James> Miniture war games
[0:15:19] <$wolfofsound> @AncelDeLambert why not both?

[0:15:37] <flamearch13> Anyone else buy a skeleton to keep them company because of PAT
[0:15:39] <+Buytoast> i wish the torch mechanic in 2 was utilized more, it was probably my most favorite mechanic and it saw little practical use outside of a few parts

[0:16:02] <+WhyIDie> nah, liam just ended
[0:16:03] <PsychoFlash1> @umbypokochan personally I think it's much harder than 1, mostly everything that comes after anor londo, general consesus is that it's the hardest souls, but I disagree with that
[0:16:04] <%Baesel20xx> Don't feed it Pat
[0:16:04] <%PlayKingdomHeartsGames> @NYCrownlessKing One boss summoned a player what do you mean not unique
[0:16:06] <KoyaMusa> so its fair for pat to steal them all
[0:16:07] <%Keyd00d> Stop trying to pit the best friends against each other

[0:16:34] <NYCrownlessKing> ya. and the mechanic didnt work msot of the time and it did nothing else but throw lightning bolts @PlayKingdomHeartsGames
[0:16:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat YOU SHOULD PLAY WARFRAME TOGETHER
[0:16:34] <OwlLightningMage> The gap is getting wider. Pat is gaining more and more. Soon Woolie will start crying out of shame LUL
[0:16:35] <Nepsotic> WHERE IS DARK SOULS BOI
[0:16:36] <corrosivePaladin> Naw the bitch move is to start at 7:30
[0:16:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @AngriestPat your 2 year anniversary is on December 11, if you weren't already told
[0:16:40] <%umbypokochan> @PsychoFlash1 i guess because i beat 2 and then played 1 and i already knew what i was doing instead of having to learn a new game
[0:16:41] <%AncelDeLambert> a Bitch Ricky move?
[0:16:45] <+NaotoKozuki> THE Race war starts now
[0:16:50] <+WhyIDie> that young aspiring streamer looking at the sun that is Viewer Count, which then gets eclipsed by Pat's giant staring head

[0:16:51] <mr_slaide> How's it feeeeeeeeeeeeel, Pat, to be a... biiiiiiiiiitch?

[0:18:44] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat small hands? remember when everyone thought u been drinking regular sized redbulls???

[0:19:35] <+TheSpiced> Vaykor Hek is from Steel Meridian
[0:19:36] <faegbeard> HOK HEK
[0:19:39] <+WhyIDie> everyone has steel meridian, might be better to go to its rival faction, and trade your rep item for meridian's. advantage is you have stuff that's more in demand after

[0:20:19] <%Freelance7> *looks at upgraded Serration* FUCK
[0:20:26] <%MagickBurritoh> the Hek looks plastic
[0:20:27] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat when selling mods, endo or money?

[0:21:00] <%FrostMass22> @captainthunderwolf This chat? maybe. I was talking about Warframe because it has autobans for the dumbest stuff in all the chat tabs
[0:21:01] <OwlLightningMage> Money becomes trivial late game. Endo is forever

[0:23:10] <Nepsotic> Did I miss the gameplay? Or haven't you started yet carciREE
[0:23:11] <Mikers29> Censor the balls with elmo cam
[0:23:20] <mrsunshinesprinkles> which warframe has the tastiest feet
[0:23:22] <Worldbrand> That's about time to look into armor scaling
[0:23:24] <releasethehounds0> Imagine not having hair. By the WoolieVS gang.
[0:23:25] <%Remery_> @captainthunderwolf Ridiculous
[0:23:27] <ArtThouBored> Is Smough a Ballchinian?

[0:23:41] <Nepsotic> ah cool
[0:23:42] <Worldbrand> make sure you understand how armor scales with enemy levels and you'll be fine
[0:23:48] <benjiFG> Is PS4 Warframe any different from PC?
[0:23:52] <captainthunderwolf> @Remery_ You show me a fat raccoon that pays for private insurance
[0:23:58] <+ren173> What soul level is pat on.
[0:23:59] <+MarshallLee67> PC is most updated- consoles don't have fortuna yet @benjiFG

[0:24:06] <%aspirationdeath> @benjifg Its always a few patches behind
[0:24:09] <%badchoice5> Hey Pat, did I get here too late to shitpost in chat?
[0:24:10] <OwlLightningMage> PS4 trade chat sucks LUL
[0:24:14] <benjiFG> i see
[0:24:16] <%umbypokochan> it's weird that i'm watching Pat talk when I could be watching Woolie play a game, is that racist?
[0:24:16] <%Solidus_113> hunter munitions is only good if you have a crit weapon
[0:24:20] <$KnivesEve> cheer200 hey shitlord been meaning to ask but do you remember where you got that one shirt of a jill sandwich, cause i would like one
[0:24:22] <+WhyIDie> +damage, multishot, then focus either on elemental mods or crit mods, depending on if weapon starts with good crit or not
[0:24:22] <%KaironFortressKnight> Is Devil May Cry 5 out yet
[0:24:24] <+redanimator> u see Kill a Kill coming to switch now
[0:24:30] <releasethehounds0> Vital sense only if the gun has more than 20% crit anything less is worthless.
[0:24:30] <+NWR_James> DAMAGE BIG UP
[0:24:31] <Deekman> Where's that silent hill 3 video he was talking about earlier?
[0:24:33] <TheEnablerr> GUN go up?
[0:24:43] <%umbypokochan> i saw fluff
[0:24:44] <Run44forrest> i enjoy pre game pat talk
[0:24:45] <captainthunderwolf> @Deekman Super Eyepatch Wolf's most recent
[0:24:55] <faegbeard> Corrosive boyo
[0:24:56] <Deekman> @captainthunderwolf thanks!
[0:25:05] <captainthunderwolf> @Deekman No probs!
[0:25:05] <%SummonerMagno> Always dmg and multishot
[0:25:27] <%badchoice5> Wait we stripping now?
[0:25:30] <Deekman> added to my Watch Later
[0:25:37] <corrosivePaladin> corrosive needed for lv30 taterLUL
[0:25:40] <%Solidus_113> if you can't reach 100% multishot effectively then the mods have less use
[0:25:51] <Nepsotic> Is pat playing on PC?
[0:25:53] <TheEnablerr> I wonder if GUN Souls would be any good.
[0:25:56] <ragasquid> yeah
[0:25:56] <Zombrocom> Corrosive does bonus damage to ancients, which are the only infested that take any effort to kill
[0:25:56] <%umbypokochan> the video is "silent hill 3 heather calls her dad" - just google it (not lies)
[0:26:01] <$Slimshazbot> @AngriestPat You gonna shoot some warframe advice Liam's way?
[0:26:13] <aiyobro> bujinn souls
[0:26:17] <Nepsotic> It was something like "The Problem With Silent Hill 3"
[0:26:19] <%badchoice5> That is seriously every "wide open system" in an mmo, there's always an optimal build
[0:26:21] <+purps26> fuck me daddy
[0:26:26] <$GohanEgret> FALLOUT
[0:26:27] <mayorrev> LUL
[0:26:30] <%Freelance7> Shadow of the Tomb Raider?
[0:26:31] <+Ciphris> +dmg +multishot (if crit +crit chance +crit damage) (if status stacking 60/60 mods)
[0:26:31] <+WhyIDie> also always level up mods evenly, don't focus and max one at a time, costs raise exponentially each rank
[0:26:32] <Djinnazz> It may be
[0:26:32] <dekkitout> does it in someway increase damage? aiight, gimmie 5
[0:26:32] <Zombrocom> The other strat is to have your team stack corrosive projections and mod for viral, need a team for that though
[0:26:33] <OwlLightningMage> Fallout 76 is the fastest for me
[0:26:35] <FoulNightingale> ITS PRETTY CLOSE
[0:26:36] <+NWR_James> 5 DAYS
[0:26:42] <cizal11> not even one fucking week

[0:26:55] <+angry_boy> what about battlefront 2
[0:26:57] <$RaikenTB> MvCi was pretty bad.
[0:26:58] <Djinnazz> it's ha;f price now.
[0:26:58] <strangelee> What were all those Overwatch clones?

[0:27:13] <$GohanEgret> Fallout 76% Off
[0:27:13] <%Solidus_113> that price still isn't low enough
[0:27:13] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I'm so glad I didn't spend the 80$ for it
[0:27:16] <+redanimator> shadow of tomb raider got rid of most blood spatters in new patch
[0:27:20] <%MaiHusbando9S> haha y-yeah guys black friday!
[0:27:25] <FoulNightingale> @GohanEgret That's pretty strong
[0:27:27] <%AbnormalVoid> at least you got paid LUL
[0:27:30] <%TheGreatPenor> I preordered 76 on discounted
[0:27:31] <cordhine> Fallout 76? More like Fallout 70 dicks.
[0:27:33] <Djinnazz> RDR2 isn't on sale, the Higher priced editions are but not the base version @AngriestPat
[0:27:33] <faegbeard> Oh goddamnit I missed the stream of Liam being a Warframe babby I AM SALT
[0:27:38] <%badchoice5> Is Pat on the quiet side for anyone else?
[0:27:40] <centipede1994> oh hi yo
[0:27:40] <TheEnablerr> How about not leaving a huge security hole with my fallout thanks
[0:27:41] <benjiFG> just redbox it lol
[0:27:46] <dekkitout> im actually gonna buy it now for the inevitable 1 year later "Fo76 is Fixed?!?"
[0:27:50] <+purps26> You wanna bet that Starfield is a multiplayer game and 76 was a test?
[0:27:52] <%AbnormalVoid> the battle maraccas
[0:27:55] <+MarshallLee67> oof
[0:27:55] <captainthunderwolf> Fallout 76? More like Fallout 33% off one week after release from all distributors.
[0:27:59] <$GohanEgret> @FoulNightingale strength go up, price go down
[0:28:01] <%superc37> eyo, isnt woolie still streaming?
[0:28:06] <%MahoganyVince> Bethesda's apparently offering refunds for F76 on PC, so yeah it's pretty bad
[0:28:07] <$wolfofsound> @superc37 ya
[0:28:07] <+furiousfurioso> A very popular streamer got 3/4ths of a full server together to fight the final super boss of Fallout 76, the server crashed and it despawned and they lost all their ammo
[0:28:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I haven't playeD me somee Dank sulz in a hot minute
[0:28:12] <WeedSpagon> Are the Sellsword Twin Blades still stupidly broken>
[0:28:18] <Nepsotic> You playing on PC, Pat?
[0:28:20] <corrosivePaladin> Pat's warmans advice hurts. Hes like half right but the other half just makes me crack up so much
[0:28:26] <%umbypokochan> Fallout? more like FART OUT!
[0:28:29] <+mechslayer71> Oh boy, these stream cannibalization numbers. Woolie stepping on toes, time to cut his off
[0:28:31] <+Dreamerrvevo> Drang hammer is alright but the only good part about it is the l1 into weapon art comob
[0:28:34] <%badchoice5> at the same time
[0:28:35] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat got any tips for modding New Vegas? when I tried the game would crash on almost every area load and I couldn't figure out why.
[0:28:36] <Nepsotic> @weedspagon They're still pretty OP especially with a sharp gem
[0:28:40] <%MahoganyVince> Fart out 70 dicks
[0:28:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> gross
[0:28:57] <%umbypokochan> @MahoganyVince you just killed me
[0:28:58] <+deity_majora> Pat gonna hide
[0:28:58] <%KaironFortressKnight> I wanna see you and Woolie stream together at some point. Play some Third Strike or some shit
[0:28:59] <OwlLightningMage> A longsword is an anti Pat build
[0:29:00] <%MahoganyVince> apatSmug
[0:29:01] <+TransporterX7> Is it just cheating?
[0:29:03] <reiju_22> monkaS
[0:29:08] <cizal11> @AngriestPat have you taken a look at fallout new california?
[0:29:10] <+TransporterX7> I bet it's just cheating
[0:29:13] <Nepsotic> I also am planning on hunting Pat. This is why I need to know if he is on PC
[0:29:16] <+AXL808> ! Pat At Risk !
[0:29:20] <+Ssaik> What even is an anti-pat build? Walk around naked and unarmed so that Pat gets overconfident and triggers Crazy Talk?
[0:29:22] <+Dreamerrvevo> Nah
[0:29:24] <+Dreamerrvevo> I don't cheat
[0:29:27] <OwlLightningMage> Pat is using a strength weapon with no poise. Just lame him out with a fast weapon
[0:29:28] <aiyobro> I didn't buy anything black friday, hoo ray for me
[0:29:29] <+Dreamerrvevo> It's a underleveled build
[0:29:31] <TheEnablerr> @Solidus_113 try the GOG version. It comes with the 4gigabyte patch placed and it's way more stable than the steam version
[0:29:37] <%Remery_> Hunt the Pat!
[0:29:38] <captainthunderwolf> If Fallout 76's servers can't even handle a nearly full-capacity fight, by the way, then that goddamn game deserves refunds.
[0:29:44] <+trnzero> anti-pat build is armor of thorns made of syringes
[0:29:44] <%badchoice5> Just googled it, DAMN there's a lot of Jill Sandwich shirts
[0:29:53] <%Your_Friendly_Futa> Is it time
[0:29:53] <mayorrev> show baby
[0:29:55] <+redanimator> wolfenstien 2 was besthaesda last year fallout 76 price drop

[0:47:28] <strangelee> wut
[0:47:28] <zamzoph> Who doesn't just run past the worm? LUL
[0:47:29] <KoyaMusa> pat what the fuck
[0:47:29] <OwlLightningMage> That worm is Sans
[0:47:30] <Worldbrand> It's what.
[0:47:36] <Aydarkzero> head cannons are fun
[0:47:38] <cizal11> no the worm is his stand get it right
[0:47:39] <+AParkedChopper> What's poppin fellas? What'd I miss?
[0:47:39] <mastermidget23> wait what.
[0:47:39] <captainthunderwolf> @Gogogolem A tutorial boss, but sure.
[0:47:41] <KoyaMusa> THE TREE IS DUSK
[0:47:43] <corrosivePaladin> But the worm is just a leftover asset from a cut zone
[0:47:43] <+Elexius> Worm's easy if you know the cheese spot
[0:47:44] <@Fuggins4U> Sans Darksouls
[0:47:48] <Deekman> i can dig it
[0:47:49] <mr_slaide> Soooo... Is this place Anor Londo?
[0:47:50] <Zombrocom> I believe this is the intended progression path. You are suppossed to see the worm, go fuck that, then explore and find the broken floor bit
[0:47:50] <+walternatorz> because of the light bug thing?
[0:47:50] <valriot> THE BIRD IS JONTRON
[0:47:50] <OwlLightningMage> Pat stop being wrong. It hurts so bad BibleThump
[0:47:52] <undeuxtroisqua> Lightning worm, thats how my gf calls it Kappa
[0:47:59] <dekkitout> anything could be solaire, that pile of rocks over there can be solaire
[0:47:59] <+ArchimerDreatect> is this pat's lore re-run? that seems to be the hip thing in th epigeon-souls'd community these days

[0:48:06] <strangelee> @AngriestPat didn't think you could dig yourself any deeper, yet here we are
[0:48:07] <LunarLancaster> Game Theory: What if Solaire is actually Sans?
[0:48:13] <+Dreamerrvevo> Pat its me
[0:48:14] <VeryTricky> FREE SHIT

[0:48:32] <captainthunderwolf> Game Theory: Is Sans Undertale secretly Gwyndolin?
[0:48:42] <+Xanax44> I smell a trap
[0:48:44] <OwlLightningMage> I thought Pat said he wasn't gonna play online to avoid hacking?
[0:48:50] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat I think he is aware who you are
[0:48:53] <undeuxtroisqua> You complain about hackers ruining your previous YET you pick up random things from strangers

[0:50:38] <Firestone12332> gg
[0:50:39] <captainthunderwolf> I think that Stronk might be in chat, Pat.

[0:50:41] <+purps26> Pat you should just get hella drunk tonightt. fuck it
[0:50:44] <strangelee> oh it's a trap
[0:50:45] <onlyglaric> Now Pat is the stronkest
[0:50:45] <+The_Review_Corps> Go get a seed of a giant tree @angriestpat
[0:50:53] <Worldbrand> That was the true trap
[0:50:53] <%Remery_> Pat doesn't show mercy :(
[0:50:53] <+Dreamerrvevo> @captainthunderwolf I was stroonk
[0:50:54] <%badchoice5> Pat was scared of his Stronk tyle
[0:50:55] <OwlLightningMage> Pat doesn't like friends. Only blood
[0:50:56] <strangelee> you grab it and the enemies close in on you
[0:50:56] <Worldbrand> you're lost now
[0:50:57] <KoyaMusa> but pat only cares about murder
[0:50:57] <%SaltyDongs> That's why I had to kill you
[0:51:00] <%umbypokochan> Pat kills his friends... Matt and Woolie are ghosts
[0:51:04] <critikal_bit> His true plan reveals itself!
[0:51:05] <+WhyIDie> pat was scared of opening his heart to friendship
[0:51:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat does not care for friendships. Only war
[0:51:07] <RichAnvils> little pat no friends
[0:51:07] <@Fuggins4U> @Dreamerrvevo when we first became friends, I rushed him with a pickaxe too
[0:51:11] <TheEnablerr> Friendship is the biggest trap of all.
[0:51:14] <cizal11> !PROGRESS AT RISK!
[0:51:20] <%ComfortableStranger> no wollie is just chemicals
[0:51:25] <HPA_StoicReaper> In Dark Souls a friend means you die.
[0:51:27] <KoyaMusa> for the first time in his life, pat truly understood the meaning of war
[0:51:30] <dekkitout> only true friends know of the pickaxe secret handshake
[0:51:31] <zamzoph> @Dreamerrvevo no friends, no mercy
[0:51:38] <aiyobro> it's the basement of the main hall and balcony
[0:51:38] <SulfurousAcid> those fucking statues
[0:51:40] <thatwaulfyguy> Without friendship, we are all truly lost
[0:51:49] <Grimlockfly> Woolie is chemtrails
[0:51:52] <%SaltyDongs> Woolie the ghost who doesn't believe in himself
[0:51:53] <zamzoph> When was Izalith NOT fucked up?
[0:51:56] <aiyobro> pat is actually in the sewers
[0:51:59] <%badchoice5> Everything dies eventually Pat, that's like the theme of Dark Souls
[0:52:00] <+Master_Vandestelca> oh man worst DS1 enemy...
[0:52:00] <Aydarkzero> demon socity got super rekt
[0:52:02] <aiyobro> izalith rose up to the sewers
[0:52:05] <+Dreamerrvevo> I just wanted to settle it over a pint of seigbrau
[0:52:05] <+placidpanda16> Do you think TWD final season will ever be completed?

[0:52:22] <Nowewulf> A friend is only an enemy that hasn't attacked yet
[0:52:23] <+Dreamerrvevo> Also pat attacked me without me getting my weapon so I got a unupgraded pickaxe
[0:52:30] <sykehm> i thought he was just gonna walk past that wall
[0:52:34] <Thalchampz> what a trooper
[0:52:34] <%badchoice5> LUL
[0:52:36] <TheEnablerr> PFFT
[0:52:39] <wicketpelican> This is the least stingy game with weapon upgrades in all soul games.

[0:53:07] <TheEnablerr> 1,000,000,000 of still being assholes
[0:53:12] <+ArchimerDreatect> but pat the lore, you saw a ds1 enemy that means B I G L O R E
[0:53:15] <+purps26> Pat have you played the new hitman games>
[0:53:16] <RichAnvils> Perseverance Great Sword = truly great sword
[0:53:18] <%badchoice5> @Dreamerrvevo You overestimated Pat, an often fatal mistake
[0:53:18] <+mastertwin2> DS3 has like 8 slabs
[0:53:24] <@PlagueOfGripes> 2 was by far the least stingy with mats
[0:53:32] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat This is what Deep Down would've been like
[0:53:37] <%badchoice5> Take a dip
[0:53:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah this whole area is anus

[0:53:53] <+Elexius> Its Lava, just wash your hands in it :)
[0:53:57] <OwlLightningMage> Deep Down is deep in the ground..
[0:53:58] <papanail> plagueofgripes more like plague of dumb Kappa

[0:55:04] <%xemnahort> @deekman welp we are all entitled to our incorrect opinions
[0:55:08] <+ATentacleMonster> to be reasonable, fair lady was already dying and blind with a poison womb
[0:55:10] <thatwaulfyguy> so i know 76 is bad, but what do the reviews look like for fallouts 5 through 75?
[0:55:12] <RichAnvils> and that crab became a skeleball
[0:55:17] <+ATentacleMonster> I don't think I'd want her living long

[0:57:09] <Heartless_01> @PlagueOfGripes best kind of rooms TPFufun
[0:57:10] <%s_xylocalsingles> love you pat <3
[0:57:12] <+Master_Vandestelca> Such a Stronk room
[0:57:12] <chimaera24> I can't believe this game has enemies that spawn turrets to attack you
[0:57:20] <%Jp3g95> howdy y'all
[0:57:20] <%hawk_rush> trying to do blood-starved beast with the kirkhammer build, getting my ass kicked
[0:57:37] <%xemnahort> Remember all the decayed dragon asses just copy pasted in lost izalith?
[0:57:40] <WeedSpagon> That room is the best for popping seed of a giant tree in while invaded
[0:57:40] <+ATentacleMonster> I usually just book it and lure them to the stairs on the left
[0:57:41] <TheEnablerr> You like fireballs boy? Well you can HAVE THEM
[0:57:45] <aiyobro> there is a hidden wall in the bonfire room too
[0:57:48] <+ATentacleMonster> good luck!
[0:57:48] <%THATGUY_789> was that the Pepis room?
[0:57:55] <+keksisblyat> Did you get the boneshard and Estus share in this area yet
[0:57:59] <OwlLightningMage> We don't talk about the last dragon orgy room
[0:57:59] <C_S_N_G> There’s the fake wall in the room with the bonfire
[0:58:08] <Daniel_Is_I> They eat you in the dark
[0:58:12] <+claudesavegely> you are likely to be eaten by one
[0:58:13] <hog_zone> you are likely to be eaten by one
[0:58:13] <%vaporousTippler> It's from Zork, mother fucker.
[0:58:16] <%xemnahort> That room is slightly less terrible but you kind of need a microscope to see the difference
[0:58:17] <%thunderdutch> Zork
[0:58:18] <%AbnormalVoid> they were small, then got bigger
[0:58:18] <+Proposition__Joe> they eat you
[0:58:19] <candidateplays> They're beasts.
[0:58:21] <+WhyIDie> pat needs to play some zork sometime
[0:58:26] <mrjohncarlton> The GRU? Well when Col. Volgin...
[0:58:31] <+Rorinator> something something abyss
[0:58:38] <enternius> The Temen-ni-Ghru
[0:58:42] <%DoktahDoktah> I like how that mace is just Leoric's mace from Diablo. Patrick Boivin the Skeleton King!
[0:58:42] <%THATGUY_789> ha i thought he said Vape wall
[0:58:46] <%MaiHusbando9S> i didnt understand them either, but they ghru on me
[0:58:46] <%superc37> theyre demons made to work for the abyss watchers
[0:58:47] <+shinpete> Invading D:
[0:58:53] <MarylandJutsu> there should be a Charecter in Seikiro named ELMOOO
[0:58:56] <WeedSpagon> Well Gru starts off wanting to steal the moon but then he falls in love with the 3 girls he adopts. I think thats his deal
[0:59:03] <%XzileGaming> Pat doing PVP wtf?
[0:59:06] <cipherscriptures> Maybe if you invested in more than piss ass vigor you could survive more hits
[0:59:08] <+Dragoneye77> lol blades of the darkmoon in 2018
[0:59:11] <%Jpdodds> Col. Volgin runs them to build the Shagohod
[0:59:29] <cizal11> went clear the wrong way lmfao
[0:59:32] <+bread_assassin> Started Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Really curious about that big thing that happens like 12 hrs in.
[0:59:34] <OwlLightningMage> I hope Pat runs into a meta lord
[0:59:42] <%MaiHusbando9S> not with that attitude
[0:59:52] <@PlagueOfGripes> you won't know until you fail
[1:00:05] <%XzileGaming> you invaded the only bigger coward than you are Pat
[1:00:12] <+Dragoneye77> Louis C.K gets lost in hell. Part 1
[1:00:12] <Futurecity10> @bread_assassin Word of warning, the ending to the game is locked behind dlc
[1:00:14] <+ATentacleMonster> :(
[1:00:18] <KoyaMusa> cowarding out like a big hero
[1:00:23] <%DesertPenguin09> Why are you still doing invasions?
[1:00:24] <+MarshallLee67> coward
[1:00:25] <%badchoice5> BIG CHEATS
[1:00:28] <+shinpete> Running Away LUL
[1:00:29] <%XzileGaming> out cowarded the coward, PRO COWARD STRAT
[1:00:30] <+keksisblyat> Coward
[1:00:33] <TheEnablerr> !COWARD!
[1:00:35] <OwlLightningMage> Only true heroes and big cowards
[1:00:38] <LunarLancaster> @Futurecity10 @bread_assassin No it's not
[1:00:38] <+Dragoneye77> that poor blade of the darkmoon
[1:00:43] <+Dragoneye77> he just wanted his ear
[1:00:44] <+Rorinator> "Sir PAtrick ran away. Bravely ran away away!"
[1:00:44] <Heartless_01> i thought pat was scared of the pvp
[1:00:45] <Futurecity10> Yes it is lunar
[1:00:48] <+mastertwin2> ! BRAVERY AT RISK !
[1:00:49] <+Elexius> If we're both big cowards, we're both the winners!
[1:00:49] <%THATGUY_789> and Pat lives to fail another day
[1:00:57] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> ! Big Blind !
[1:00:58] <joestar115> Can't lose if you don't fight
[1:01:02] <cipherscriptures> If you pin a coward and a coward together they outbalance their cowardness
[1:01:04] <%badchoice5> Pat, your play in Dark Souls 3 has inspired me to run away from MY problems in life as well, rather than dealing with them!
[1:01:15] <%XzileGaming> never been defeat, cant be defeat if dont fight
[1:01:15] <+ATentacleMonster> I miss when Pat was big and strong
[1:01:16] <+shinpete> Isn't irrithyl the true battle arena? Why try here?
[1:01:18] <+MisterCrimson> Hi, Lost. I'm dad.
[1:01:20] <cipherscriptures> A coward plus a coward equals a hero
[1:01:23] <+purps26> fuck town
[1:01:25] <Futurecity10> @LunarLancaster if its not locked behind dlc then why is the dlc in question named after the thing that has no conclusion.
[1:01:25] <LunarLancaster> @Futurecity10 You complete what you set out to do. Just because you don't get a big "End Game" screeen doesn't mean it isn't an ending
[1:01:27] <MarylandJutsu> PAIGE IS GIVING PAT THE BLIND
[1:01:27] <DraxTD> HOW... how can you be lost @AngriestPat , I thought your spacial awareness in this game was unparealle
[1:01:31] <aiyobro> this is like a boss arena
[1:01:31] <%hawk_rush> never mind, just dominated and pounded away at it
[1:01:32] <%Fistofgraal> Do combo

[1:01:52] <SkyPirateArcane> Oooh
[1:01:59] <cipherscriptures> @thatguy_789 no we leave that in Bloodborne where it belongs
[1:02:09] <LunarLancaster> @Futurecity10 Because things can always be expanded upon. That's why sequels exist.
[1:02:10] <%badchoice5> As a coward, you die with your every step Pat
[1:02:12] <+PulverKong> @AngriestPat oh hello pat i was just watching episode 1 of this

[1:06:00] <%Gogogolem> I hope Kojima dresses up as V
[1:06:00] <SkyPirateArcane> We care about the cringe
[1:06:01] <+Cptn_Turtle> awards are fiiiiiiiiine
[1:06:02] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat well looks like smash aint gettin any awards this year
[1:06:02] <$PulverKong> @AngriestPat did my cheer get through or do you read them later?
[1:06:02] <Worldbrand> The VGA was so much better than the PS experience show it's unbelievable
[1:06:03] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat don't forget about that new Alien Blackout game that was recently teased
[1:06:06] <%Metballs> why the fuck are the game awards on Thursday?
[1:06:08] <RipSlamsteak> I hope Kojima dabs and walks off stage without saying anything
[1:06:09] <+Proposition__Joe> when will MGSv get released
[1:06:11] <Angry_Ev1L> do we really need even more dmc5 spoilers lol?
[1:06:12] <Mikers29> Fallout 76 wins a GOTY
[1:06:14] <%MagickBurritoh> V from DMCV or 2077?
[1:06:14] <captainthunderwolf> DMCV news is the greatest game award of all.
[1:06:14] <dekkitout> its like waiting for movie trailers during the superbowl
[1:06:15] <+Dragoneye77> I hope Tommy from a way out shows up
[1:06:16] <%Metballs> it's the dumbest shit for work
[1:06:18] <$Falilth> and schlick man
[1:06:20] <ArtThouBored> Game Awards is a trailer showcase like E3
[1:06:20] <JoeNeutrino> Oh well I'm definitely interested in the bullshit!
[1:06:22] <+Bloodxb> kojima crosses over with itsuno
[1:06:23] <$RaikenTB> will Fallout 76 win anything? LUL
[1:06:25] <artoflec> literally just watching it for the V trailer and maybe Bayonetta 3 trailer
[1:06:29] <AFlyingTaco1> @Metballs Because they knew Smash was gonna come out the day afterwards LUL
[1:06:31] <Deekman> But who is most influential gamer sponsored by mountain dew
[1:06:32] <MarylandJutsu> GAME AWARDS KNOWS SMASH IS MORE IMPROTANT
[1:06:33] <+redanimator> i hope kojima announces death stranding coming to pc now
[1:06:33] <calvarok> they barely show anything though
[1:06:35] <%SergeEXE> not even the VGA's would survive Smash Release Day
[1:06:37] <misterspotswood> @RaikenTB biggest dumpster fire
[1:06:37] <kite1haseo> @RaikenTB no
[1:06:40] <strangelee> No Pat, you're just bad
[1:06:42] <zamzoph> Chalice Dungeons DansGame
[1:06:42] <aiyobro> wanna come to my place and play smash? ;) ;)
[1:06:42] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> No Pat shut up
[1:06:42] <@Fuggins4U> I wish I still used Windows XP
[1:06:43] <Deekman> SCHICK HYDROBOT FOR SMASH!
[1:06:45] <%badchoice5> and not even a GOOD chalice dungeon
[1:06:48] <@Fuggins4U> does it even support 4k?
[1:06:49] <+RushUnplugged> you want them to work on a WEEKEND? like plebeian devs or something?
[1:06:50] <candidateplays> It\s the rused assets of the planned challice dungeon system, that never got made
[1:06:51] <%OdysseyKnight> Poor Izalith, always last
[1:06:53] <cizal11> not evne close
[1:06:57] <%THATGUY_789> Salad Chalice
[1:06:57] <artoflec> There's also a Dante showcase stream on CapcomUK's channel on the 26th at some point
[1:07:00] <%hawk_rush> probably, yeah
[1:07:05] <%SergeEXE> BIG TITANITE
[1:07:14] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Big drinks
[1:07:16] <+claudesavegely> they sure live giving you titanite shards
[1:07:19] <ArtThouBored> If only it was a chalice dungeon
[1:07:20] <+micalica> Pat that sure is a big fuckin stick you got there
[1:07:25] <Angry_Ev1L> you know what game need chalice dungeon mode? DMC5
[1:07:33] <strangelee> @AngriestPat you're approaching it it from the middle with a bad sense of direction
[1:07:33] <$RaikenTB> put some shampoo on that stick ffs
[1:07:34] <%crimsonharvest> What's better chat, flanged mace or some other kinda inferior mace
[1:07:38] <IBeastmanNinjaI1> This area kind of looks untextured to be honest
[1:07:39] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Paige can do it
[1:07:39] <@PlagueOfGripes> I hate these fucking bloodborne enemies
[1:07:40] <%MelBrooksKA> @Fuggins4U XP doesn't support XBone controllers, I highly doubt it even has a data type to DISPLAY 4K
[1:07:40] <ArtThouBored> Chalice dungeons look like shit
[1:07:40] <SkyPirateArcane> By dying
[1:07:42] <SailingSaturn> She's gonna die cirSlain
[1:07:42] <@Fuggins4U> also, full discloure pre-emptive Johns: I am AWFUL at Smash
[1:07:43] <Worldbrand> She will probably handle it hilariously
[1:07:43] <cizal11> IT'S NOT GONNA GO WELL
[1:07:43] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> She's BIG and STRONG
[1:07:44] <hntronium> WITH BRUTE SMARTS
[1:07:49] <dekkitout> brute force smarta
[1:07:50] <KoyaMusa> oh that's gonna be a painful stream
[1:07:51] <%badchoice5> She still has to make it through DS2, she's got time
[1:07:52] <captainthunderwolf> She'll have a BIG SWORD and BIG ARMOR and spousal abuse..
[1:07:52] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat She'll miss it entirely
[1:07:54] <aero160h> What do we need to do to get you and Woolie to fight each other in DS3?
[1:07:55] <+keksisblyat> Hope Lady an Trish are playable in DMC V
[1:07:56] <+micalica> Instead of panicking, all she has to do is roll like once or twice and spam R1
[1:07:56] <+Proposition__Joe> this area is optional so who cares
[1:07:56] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> She;ll handle it inexplicably and screaming, I imagine.
[1:07:58] <+walternatorz> I thought invisible clocks are her kryptonite
[1:07:59] <%imextremelymanly> shes better than all of us in souls games remember
[1:08:00] <@Fuggins4U> like, it's like setting the AI difficult to -3
[1:08:01] <Angry_Ev1L> @Fuggins4U so is Pat
[1:08:01] <%crimsonharvest> THis area is optional anyway
[1:08:02] <MarylandJutsu> @Fuggins4U nah its all good, we know Elmo will thrash you and Pat in Smash Bros
[1:08:06] <C_S_N_G> With you loving support and honks
[1:08:07] <+micalica> if she can get past panicking, every Souls game is easy
[1:08:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Woolie got through here, Paige will be fine
[1:08:18] <%badchoice5> She's gonna accidentally fall through the geometry and land at the end
[1:08:20] <JoeNeutrino> I get so lost in here
[1:08:20] <+DeathsDoom> she can just use a estoc and poke all the pains away lol
[1:08:21] <aiyobro> there are no crabs in my game lol
[1:08:22] <$RaikenTB> @micalica That's big if.
[1:08:23] <%SergeEXE> KILL THE LIGHTENING PENIS
[1:08:23] <%THATGUY_789> Pat wants a Phallus Dungeon
[1:08:32] <captainthunderwolf> You mean a vagina?
[1:08:38] <JoeNeutrino> I love the estoc
[1:08:42] <+BubTheBozo> Pat did you know you can roll into illusionary walls? you dont have to hit them
[1:08:45] <benjiFG> inb4 R1
[1:08:52] <Intolerable> This isn't even a lake
[1:08:54] <+Ciphris> who cares about meta if you're having fun
[1:08:55] <Daniel_Is_I> The DLC scythe is one of the most fun weapons in this game
[1:08:57] <+TransporterX7> ITS FUN BECAUSE IT WORKS
[1:08:59] <%crimsonharvest> My favorites are still the DS1/2 mace, the club, and the regular claymore
[1:08:59] <+micalica> Yeah it's really hard not to panic, but once you start practicing and see more of the game, things stop surprising you. @RaikenTB
[1:09:01] <%FrostMass22> "Fuck the pain away" -Mr Plinkett
[1:09:01] <kite1haseo> NOW
[1:09:03] <hntronium> END HIM RIGHTLY
[1:09:04] <%SergeEXE> THUNDER B E P I S
[1:09:04] <+MarshallLee67> CHEESE
[1:09:04] <%d00msdaydan> i thought the problem people had with estoc was that its moveset was just poke poke poke poke poke until you die
[1:09:05] <+bubbli97> now
[1:09:06] <%ComfortableStranger> bonfire LIT AF
[1:09:07] <SkyPirateArcane> Cheese that fuck

[1:09:09] <+Bouerd> Cheese him
[1:09:11] <TheEnablerr> C H E E S E

[1:09:21] <Mikers29> I love the big dumb demon fist weapons
[1:09:22] <cipherscriptures> CHEESE
[1:09:23] <WeedSpagon> If I remember correctly they nerfed the right hand damage with the estoc but not the left hand damage which is a really weird decision imo.

[1:31:28] <thehollow89> peeing a lot is a symptom of diabetes

[1:31:52] <+CyberTheory> peeing is a symbol of weakness
[1:31:56] <+WhyIDie> song really doesn't go with these arts
[1:31:57] <+SuichiTanaka> Probably a soundcloud artist
[1:31:58] <%THATGUY_789> no coopyrights

[1:33:48] <TheEnablerr> Oh no! Woolies!
[1:33:51] <%DoktahDoktah> Good music for an AFK outro would be bad. Because you would be listening to something good and not want it to stop. This music right here is accurate to reflect a simple break. Catchy but you wouldnt feel akward if it stopped running randomly.
[1:33:51] <+WhyIDie> the raid's just in time to get pee'd on
[1:34:00] <SafetyBet> Can't believe Pat changed P5 music
[1:34:01] <+NWR_James> Pat really Pat'd this one

[1:36:12] <+Goshism> Did Pat fall into the toilet?

[1:56:06] <%craig_t> 2 part story, but i'm giving you twitchbucks for each - I got into your content when ds3 came out, and as time went by i got more in more into it. when i finally started the podcast, I was starting to get very interested in these "fight games", and by august I decided to give this "evoh" a chance. I got super hype, blew my paycheck, and started trying to get into the community. I've been going to meetups pretty regularly since, getting my ass handed to me. cheer200

[1:56:13] <%craig_t> Earlier this week I went to a meetup, played some SC6 and tekken 7. Near the end of the night, I noticed a guy on one of the setups making Nero in the SC6 char creator. We got to talking about the franchise, and stuff like Dante being a TMNT, and it turned out that we were both into it because of you dudes. When we talked further, we discovered that we were both into fg's for the same reason. You're doing gods work, you old scrublord. cheer200

[2:10:17] <+AXL808> fuck me, Pat takes these guys out in 2-3 hits and they kill me before I can finish casting
[2:10:20] <TerraWraith> So 40 senconds from now
[2:10:35] <+king_wragles> Then don't cast?
[2:10:39] <cizal11> casting sucks in ds3 so that makes sense
[2:10:41] <OwlLightningMage> Magic is bad in this game
[2:10:49] <TerraWraith> Wow, my brain said that was how to spell seconds. It's been a rough day
[2:10:50] <+thebestestkevin> "is this ringed city?" - pat
[2:10:52] <dekkitout> is this the ringed city?
[2:10:52] <+Xanax44> The Ringed City is supposed to remind you of here
[2:10:53] <OwlLightningMage> BibleThump
[2:10:58] <Ultimatefool> Is that Bort's mace?
[2:11:02] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Between Jevil's theme and seam's theme, what is your favorite deltarune track?
[2:11:02] <+keksisblyat> That’s probably on purpose
[2:11:04] <%badchoice5> Casting in DS3 is only for BIG DICK GS
[2:11:05] <+Arsimckhoi> plot twist IT IS THE RINGED CITY
[2:11:06] <Parapattern> "It's poetry. They rhyme."
[2:11:07] <%craig_t> correction - casting is bad in pve
[2:11:14] <%cherubsanonymous> These guys are coolio

[2:12:10] <+thebestestkevin> ds3 clearly only wants you to play in a few specific ways, one of my biggest criticisms of it
[2:12:14] <clolei> are fire the fire witches hollows? they disappear instead of just dying
[2:12:17] <TerraWraith> If Ornstein was Anor Londo, then who was phone!?
[2:12:18] <Parapattern> It was like a flip book

[2:12:35] <Hydrapissed> !uptime
[2:12:37] <%craig_t> i wish enemies like this had better ways of dealing with up close enemies
[2:12:37] <dekkitout> eastus; grip n' sip
[2:12:39] <+FloorBurger> Fire bois getting some good hits in.
[2:12:46] <+MarshallLee67> at least you don't really need to backtrack and fight them multiple times or anything
[2:13:01] <MementoExtasis> 24 hour stream PogChamp
[2:13:07] <cizal11> this one is SUCH horseshit lmfao
[2:13:13] <Hydrapissed> or u can leave her to flounder about
[2:13:15] <+MarshallLee67> god yeah fuck that hidden shit
[2:13:16] <Hydrapissed> that can be cool to
[2:13:22] <+spook_knightatx> lirikCLENCH lirikCLENCH
[2:13:22] <+tussletoes> Miyazaki had a blast forgetting what Dark Souls is supposed to feel like and made everything faster and more aggressive imo
[2:13:24] <+MarshallLee67> i found most hidden walls on my own but that one was ass
[2:13:25] <IShadowStrykerI> whens paige gonna play ds2 and 3
[2:13:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Village of the Hidden Shit
[2:13:35] <+Tylermcd93> It is?
[2:13:37] <C_S_N_G> I didn’t find that until my third playthrough
[2:13:37] <$GohanEgret> t h i c c
[2:13:43] <+MarshallLee67> who is this thicc bitch
[2:13:43] <+thebestestkevin> @tussletoes i get the feeling he just wanted to make bloodborne 2
[2:13:47] <zettig> @AngriestPat What's the lore behind that lady?
[2:13:48] <+FloorBurger> She went for the 720. Respect.
[2:13:49] <OwlLightningMage> After Dragon's Dogma
[2:13:53] <KoyaMusa> will paige do demon's souls too?
[2:13:53] <+Bloodxb> after she beats dragons dogma
[2:13:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> really?
[2:13:55] <roboguy2k> why would you subject anyone to DaS2
[2:13:57] <candidateplays> No? Dorhy isn't that important, and she's not Drhys. Dorhys is dead.
[2:14:00] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat you ever do an sl1 build? i'm doing a refresher run of ds3, and prepping for the hurt
[2:14:01] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Finally 2019 is looking up Kappa
[2:14:01] <+king_wragles> I was going to make a joke and say 2019, looks like I was correct actually
[2:14:02] <$serpenttucker> Paige? Blitzing?
[2:14:05] <%badchoice5> DS2 is great
[2:14:08] <%craig_t> YEAH
[2:14:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> u sure?
[2:14:15] <+tussletoes> @thebestestkevin which to be fair, is a good idea. Just name it Bloodborne next time
[2:14:16] <MementoExtasis> 4Head PAT
[2:14:16] <%SergeEXE> Shadow Puzzle
[2:14:20] <%OdysseyKnight> If she does the DLC, Fume Knight will either be Paige easy for her or it will break her soul
[2:14:24] <%OdysseyKnight> There will be no in between
[2:14:25] <+thebestestkevin> I remember I went thru this area the first time with the Farron Greatsword, when it was shit
[2:14:28] <IShadowStrykerI> mad hype for what i can only assume is gonna be powerstance greatsword badassery
[2:14:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> And then Catherine in February!!!
[2:14:33] <%forevern2dust> SL too tiny
[2:14:34] <+megaotter> DS2 is awesome, I like DS1 the best, but actually prefer 2 to 3
[2:14:37] <Graywolf_the_45th> Is pat a casul?
[2:14:37] <%xemnahort> @badchoice5 finally someone with good taste
[2:14:37] <+spook_knightatx> lirikGREAT lirikGREAT
[2:14:38] <+WhyIDie> you're not able to powerlevel an SL1 character off screen LUL
[2:14:38] <%MaiHusbando9S> number go up
[2:14:39] <goddamndavid> pat the coward
[2:14:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> g e t b i g
[2:14:44] <turtlesawd> it's pretty fine in 1, cause equipment can be upgraded
[2:14:45] <WotanCR> casul
[2:14:48] <+NWR_James> ked
[2:14:49] <+SaurianCrash> try onslaught mod V:
[2:14:49] <JoeNeutrino> The primary feelgood of the game is kill the big thing.
[2:14:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> me too
[2:14:53] <%badchoice5> Pat loves getting big, that's why he's with Paige
[2:14:54] <+Tylermcd93> SL1 is the most pointless shit in the world
[2:14:58] <WotanCR> EASY MODE NOW AVAILABLE
[2:14:59] <+sundizzle> exactly, who likes a challenge?
[2:14:59] <grayjammer> I think she's Dorhys, and I think she's important *enough* to be *somewhat* of a notable character
[2:15:01] <+thebestestkevin> @tussletoes yeah honestly a lot of problems i have with this game could be easily solved by just not calling it DS3
[2:15:02] <bleugh> getting big in dark souls is cheating
[2:15:06] <%n33t_1337> @angriestpat Would it be better if there was a mode dedicated to it?
[2:15:07] <MementoExtasis> Get loot from big thing
[2:15:07] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat On a scale from baby to lobsjr How inclined are you to do a bullshit meme run of this game?
[2:15:09] <LtThunderbolt> what
[2:15:11] <+Xanax44> what
[2:15:13] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat so street fighter would be better if every time zangeif won a match, his grabs did more damage in the next match?
[2:15:13] <Worldbrand> what
[2:15:14] <%SaltyDongs> what
[2:15:15] <+MarshallLee67> the gray stuff?

[2:15:45] <andreasanf> save then send
[2:15:45] <misterspotswood> is paige drunk?
[2:15:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Don't go to the West Wing. IT IS FORBIDDEN!!!
[2:15:46] <candidateplays> The Japanese version implies Dorhys is dead, so she's probably not her.
[2:15:50] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat the nice friendly thing, or the big dark thing?
[2:15:52] <inksmears> LUL
[2:15:52] <Kilagn> @AngriestPat Would you want another Bloodborne/Dark souls or a new Armored Core game from FromSoftware?
[2:15:53] <%SuperCasualBoom> Did Paige had an edible???
[2:15:53] <benjiFG> isn't it too late after you pass the bridge
[2:15:54] <%forevern2dust> Is this anor londo?
[2:15:56] <%badchoice5> Basically Anor Londo, fuck you if you disagree
[2:15:59] <MementoExtasis> Kappa sure
[2:16:01] <grayjammer> did you even send out Grey?
[2:16:02] <misterspotswood> idk man, you sound drunk
[2:16:02] <%MaiHusbando9S> tired is a kind of drunk
[2:16:02] <Worldbrand> You should look it up to be safe
[2:16:04] <andreasanf> just avoid going into the dungeons
[2:16:06] <+RushUnplugged> it's the same if you do it before the boss
[2:16:11] <+nova12833> do the thing then remember to do the other thing as well
[2:16:12] <%konekoryugamine> Just playing Stick of Truth

[2:17:00] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Never got this quest fully completed
[2:17:04] <+king_wragles> (that stream was great btw)
[2:17:14] <%badchoice5> @SuperCasualBoom It's not her fault, she can't see the serving size on the label
[2:17:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I loved Paige's BS stream
[2:17:34] <+Rhaenarr> if you save the vegetable its enough to save grey

[2:18:42] <Mr_Strut> Pat is going to make his child a bastard
[2:18:43] <gorillahandz> best ending is ending the fire just saying
[2:18:44] <C_S_N_G> The best ending
[2:18:45] <+Chud_Pudsley> Reversal into an F5
[2:18:47] <Tampaoster> you are going to pound that delicious firekeeper to the ground
[2:18:48] <+king_wragles> Demon Souls ending, gotcha. ... fucking what?
[2:18:48] <OwlLightningMage> I have no idea what Pat is talking about
[2:18:51] <+sundizzle> the worst but best ending
[2:18:53] <+NWR_James> ! BABY AT RISK OF BASTARD !
[2:18:53] <+MarshallLee67> is that where you do the black and then you attack at the end
[2:18:54] <%SuperCasualBoom> @badchoice5 Mustard doesn’t come in a 2 liter
[2:18:55] <+purps26> let elmo outside
[2:18:58] <+Chud_Pudsley> F5 into choke slam
[2:18:59] <captainthunderwolf> Best ending is, fuck it, I AM EATING THE SUN.

[2:19:09] <dekkitout> no make anor londo great ending
[2:19:10] <captainthunderwolf> Cycles? Fire? Fuck you, I AM EATING THE SUN.
[2:19:11] <chimaera24> @AngriestPat Demon souls had two endings pat
[2:19:13] <+Chud_Pudsley> Pick up into a back breaks
[2:19:16] <gorillahandz> He means he's going to kill the Firekeeper at the end and betray her
[2:19:18] <zamzoph> Pat doing the most bastard ending D:
[2:19:21] <TerraWraith> Paige, which one is the marriage tiddy? I remember the left one can shrink in when it's scared like Shlorpy.
[2:19:25] <benjiFG> pat no
[2:19:28] <+Chud_Pudsley> So ending 2.5
[2:19:29] <gorillahandz> Like how you can step all over the Black Maiden at the end of Demon Souls
[2:19:30] <%Keyd00d> you ass heh
[2:19:30] <+Chud_Pudsley> Lol
[2:19:30] <OwlLightningMage> WHAT THE FUCK IS HE TALKING ABOUT
[2:19:30] <%SuperCasualBoom> @badchoice5 Dear god...we must let that information reach Paige.
[2:19:39] <JoeNeutrino> Is that the sudden heel turn ending?
[2:19:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> Do we at least get to smash before killing Firekeep waifu?
[2:19:45] <benjiFG> please pat
[2:19:46] <Enemy_In_Disguise> So 3
[2:19:48] <zamzoph> We do know tho
[2:19:50] <LtThunderbolt> so vauge
[2:19:51] <+king_wragles> NIER AUTOMATA I THINK?
[2:19:52] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I know, I just never cared
[2:19:55] <OwlLightningMage> That's ending 4 to me
[2:19:55] <+Rhaenarr> @OwlLightningMage the one that you be mean
[2:19:56] <+RushUnplugged> when you do the thing but then not
[2:19:57] <+Rhaenarr> to waifu
[2:19:58] <captainthunderwolf> Usurping the Flame just sort of feels like the proper, canon ending to the series as a whole.
[2:20:00] <+MarshallLee67> okay yeah i figured
[2:20:00] <gorillahandz> I got it first ;c
[2:20:02] <+Chud_Pudsley> The anime turn around and leave ending
[2:20:09] <+MarshallLee67> i got it earlier too >:c
[2:20:16] <OwlLightningMage> That ending is stupid
[2:20:18] <+Rorinator> @AngriestPat You gonna go though all those backflips to save greirat?
[2:20:26] <%Keyd00d> ass combat
[2:20:27] <candidateplays> There's kind of a fifth. You can do the end of fire and just leave. You don't get the final lines from the firekeeper or kill her.
[2:20:32] <Thalchampz> oh cool PogChampo
[2:20:34] <%SergeEXE> I've watched a bunch already
[2:20:34] <DrDomVonDoom> Pat the realest Zaibatsu heel
[2:20:36] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Still a big fan of ending 2
[2:20:38] <%SergeEXE> just never finished
[2:20:39] <Angry_Ev1L> I fucking love ace combat too can;t wait
[2:20:44] <+Arsimckhoi> i just watch jojo episode 1 what the hell am i getting into?
[2:20:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat ur cute ;3
[2:20:50] <zamzoph> those Belkans can go nuke themselves again
[2:20:53] <+NWR_James> METEOR FALL
[2:20:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> what is an EVO?
[2:20:58] <+Rhaenarr> i agree that one is the worst ending ever
[2:21:03] <misterspotswood> ohhh hes doing the ending i got
[2:21:04] <DrDomVonDoom> It’s a trap @arsimckhoi
[2:21:06] <agadejobi> @AngriestPat Did you ever finish Zeta Gundam? You stopped talking about it on the podcast
[2:21:08] <Worldbrand> That sounds about right
[2:21:14] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Dark Souls has no non-stupid endings. Rule the world? Leave? Heel-turn? No matter what, you're doing fuck-all for whoever I guess in a world that's so fucked that the lore doesn't even agree with itself.
[2:21:15] <agadejobi> I really wanted to hear you shit on Katz
[2:21:17] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Only done ending 2, I'm probably going to do ending 4. Mainly due to you are inspiring me to play DS3 again now that I got the season pass for DS3. Going to go for big mace build, swol builds are fun.
[2:21:17] <OwlLightningMage> I like ending one because it's different from other ending one
[2:21:26] <ArtThouBored> Astaroth Boyz
[2:21:31] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[2:21:33] <+Chud_Pudsley> She earned that.

[2:21:57] <captainthunderwolf> She sleepy
[2:21:59] <+redstonej> Real fucking Neto
[2:22:03] <JoeNeutrino> Nito invented skeletons. Before him everyone was a blob.
[2:22:09] <machshop> if nito was the first of the dead, who got first blood?
[2:22:12] <captainthunderwolf> @dekkitout Literally, like, the first organism to bite it
[2:22:15] <%Keyd00d> south park

[2:22:19] <Graywolf_the_45th> south park thing
[2:22:19] <+king_wragles> !Paige will remember this!
[2:22:20] <%SaltyDongs> Memberries
[2:22:20] <flattopswag> dumb South Park shit
[2:22:20] <%badchoice5> Paige's love of short, stunted men (pygmies) out weighs her love of skeletons (Nito)
[2:22:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Its a South park
[2:22:22] <TheEdrem> he doesn't member
[2:22:22] <%TaifuDragon> MEMBER STAR WARS

[2:22:56] <+king_wragles> @AlfredoCavatelli You've been watching for 6 months straight?
[2:22:57] <captainthunderwolf> @dekkitout It sounds cool until you realize that makes him the prime bitch. He's the first dude to get ganked. But he's king skeleton, so it pays off i guess.
[2:22:59] <ArtThouBored> Stop dancing!
[2:23:01] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Pat is it bad that I like LittleV's version of fighting gold then the original?
[2:23:12] <+spook_knightatx> shroudG shroudG
[2:23:12] <OwlLightningMage> @captainthunderwolf I don't like that ending because it seems even less like nothing. The other ending at least seem to imply something that makes some sense
[2:23:14] <+Chud_Pudsley> You pay $8600 to CONSUME PRODUCT and then go back to work.
[2:23:14] <%seaearthandsky> says the man getting payed for his vacation LUL
[2:23:21] <+Arsimckhoi> streaming isn't hard bruh... people get shot at for a living... your job is alright

[2:24:02] <+RushUnplugged> GOT
[2:24:02] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage Usurping the Flame makes perfect sense. You absorb the Fire, forcing it into balance with the Dark Soul, ending the cycle by throwing the world into forced stasis that favors neither the Light nor Dark Soul. It's the true "Lord" ending.
[2:24:03] <Intolerable> HAHAHAHA
[2:24:04] <%hawk_rush> loooool
[2:24:04] <%Tarantulawl> You get paid vacation in America, if you have a GOOD job

[2:24:58] <C_S_N_G> Paige is recording enemy sounds for DS4
[2:24:59] <+Chud_Pudsley> Is she peeing on the couch AGAIN!?
[2:24:59] <LixFury> 2
[2:25:01] <OwlLightningMage> @captainthunderwolf That's not the one I meant. I don't like the betrayal one
[2:25:03] <%Freelance7> 2
[2:25:04] <+king_wragles> I don't know what Paige is doing, but I assume it is OBSCENE
[2:25:05] <gorillahandz> Paige you fuckin klutz
[2:25:07] <Djinnazz> is there not a table in front of you?
[2:25:08] <flattopswag> Is this why you zoomed in the camera
[2:25:08] <+Rorinator> Dankest couch
[2:25:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> 'oh oh oh no' so cute
[2:25:09] <%FrostMass22> She's spilled zebra cum all over
[2:25:10] <+WhyIDie> each stain is a precious memory
[2:25:11] <+TheMattman1313> RIP chat replays.
[2:25:13] <+AXL808> It['s actually spilt all over the couch off camera
[2:25:18] <%MaiHusbando9S> gotta mark her territory
[2:25:18] <+NWR_James> I hope they used scotchguard on that couch
[2:25:19] <$GohanEgret> be like an old person and cover it with a plastic tarp
[2:25:19] <candidateplays> I love that these dogs have human skulls
[2:25:20] <+FloorBurger> She nailed it, Pat. Chill.
[2:25:22] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage That's because that only actually is stupid.
[2:25:23] <shurtal> did pat already talk to Patches about the thinge he needs patches to do?
[2:25:23] <DrDomVonDoom> That couch is the darkest timeline ever
[2:25:31] <+TheMattman1313> I WONDER WHY
[2:25:32] <%Vanic_Venator> The furtive couch, so easily stained
[2:25:33] <cizal11> are these like prototypes of the big doggo on the bridge
[2:25:33] <+Chud_Pudsley> You gotta housebreak her already Pat. Come on.
[2:25:33] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Why does Twitch hate us so?

[2:26:24] <Graywolf_the_45th> Dark Souls 2 got announced at the game awards didn't it?
[2:26:25] <%Keyd00d> WRONG
[2:26:25] <+FloorBurger> "Im super right"
[2:26:29] <gorillahandz> P A T
[2:26:31] <dekkitout> shadows die twice had a teaser at the game awards didnt it?
[2:26:31] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Oh, Sekuro was announced at Game Awards wasn't it?
[2:26:32] <Pajex_> NEXT TOPIC
[2:26:32] <$GohanEgret> G O U T

[2:26:39] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Bloodborne 2 for Packinko @AngriestPat
[2:26:39] <OwlLightningMage> I don't want BB2. I want another new setting instead.
[2:26:42] <Parapattern> Where do you go from the end of Bloodborne, though?
[2:26:42] <fingalights> Sekiro was thouh
[2:26:43] <+spook_knightatx> lirikTOS lirikTOS lirikTOS
[2:26:44] <%Aitch971> Sekuro was game awards

[2:26:48] <candidateplays> More teased than announced
[2:26:50] <flattopswag> I'm full of self-deprecation :)
[2:26:51] <onlyglaric> The game awards were wrong
[2:26:54] <%BrazenMask> Neither of you will be full of shit if bloodbborne 2 gets announced
[2:26:54] <%Keyd00d> Bayo 3 was announced last year. Still no word on it since then
[2:26:54] <machshop> is this the power of boivin's stand
[2:26:56] <+Arsimckhoi> PAT ! what would your video game be like? what genre and what's the plot?
[2:26:57] <captainthunderwolf> @OwlLightningMage As long as we agree that these games literally went out of their way to stop making sense come DS3. The storyline feels like they genuinely want it to not matter at this point. The world's becoming trees, there's angel, Pontiff Sulyvahn is the Darklurker, it's all ???? and it's all unexplained.
[2:27:02] <gorillahandz> Game Awards into Smash release is such a fucking back to back hype blast
[2:27:02] <%PalmtopNami> Sekro was the GA's @angriestpat
[2:27:04] <ArtThouBored> Soul Calibur 6 was announced at game award I think
[2:27:04] <%badchoice5> Paige is trying to hide Pat's rightness from us
[2:27:04] <%MagickBurritoh> apatWrong
[2:27:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is a poopy boi
[2:27:17] <+Rorinator> So much gurgling in these games

[2:27:36] <+NWR_James> poopy boi
[2:27:37] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat you don't have to worry about DMCAs Pat. Vinny Vinesauce confirmed with Twitch that the new rules are basically just the old rules. He ESPECIALLY doesn't want to make any mistakes because he streams copyrighted music EVERY stream. There's nothing to worry about :)

[2:28:43] <captainthunderwolf> @AngriestPat Ang Pat, of the Sup Best Friends, co host of the Rub Wep Hour.
[2:28:45] <+mgskomododragon> but does bloodborne 2 NEED to come out?

[2:28:50] <%FrostMass22> Pat can't run away from Fuccboivin
[2:28:52] <OwlLightningMage> It wouldn't make me happy. I want mech souls instead
[2:28:56] <+AXL808> the madness is too strong for Bloodborne 2
[2:28:56] <%MaiHusbando9S> bad luck for us impersonal computer users
[2:28:57] <valriot> Knack 3 tho
[2:28:58] <TioXyco> bloodbourne would not come to pc. 'cuz it's sony's IP
[2:28:59] <+RushUnplugged> they're keeping BB2 for the ps5, wanna bet?
[2:28:59] <+Chud_Pudsley> @AngriestPat Did you ever read that article last year where From Software said they still wanna do Armored Core?
[2:28:59] <+Rhaenarr> Oh fuck. You made me hyped up for it Pat! I don't deserve thsi

[2:29:16] <+AXL808> Our eyes have yet to open for Bloodborne 2
[2:29:17] <blademaster247> El-mo, Dan-te, Mo-ther

[2:29:51] <OwlLightningMage> Armored Souls
[2:29:54] <$GohanEgret> all mech games have been tainted by ZOE2 for me

[2:32:30] <%FrostMass22> Isn't Bloodborne the painting from Ashes of Ariandel?
[2:32:31] <DrDomVonDoom> That’s the darkest timeline
[2:32:32] <+JenovasPuppet> Was that the Baby Jesus?
[2:32:32] <dekkitout> by a little context, he means a dissertation
[2:32:34] <+king_wragles> @PlagueOfGripes Featuring Dante&Knuckles from Funky Mode
[2:32:36] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah, I thought the tie was to Demon's Souls, not Dark Souls.
[2:32:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's bullshit anyway. just more fan masturbation over nothing
[2:32:36] <%xxviios> Age of DEEP WATER
[2:32:38] <Worldbrand> @Breakfast_Megapowers dont fucking tell me about things i didnt know i wanted
[2:32:38] <%mandragoraroot> no
[2:32:38] <Darmarock> Alpha Bloodborne was Demon's Souls continuation, not Dark Souls
[2:32:38] <weissguard> ! Credibility At RISK!
[2:32:39] <DRAGKUDO> He's afraid Crazy talk will make it not true
[2:32:40] <Tevvy> i know it and its bullshit
[2:32:41] <flattopswag> Dark Core, Featuring dead memes
[2:32:42] <Jaxnos> The mention of the age of deep water
[2:32:42] <%SuperCasualBoom> Dark Souls vs Bloodborne Infinite
[2:32:43] <+Foobe> truly madman's knowledge
[2:32:44] <Jaxnos> ye
[2:32:44] <Kaitepaints> Put the hot one on camera
[2:32:45] <Zombrocom> Oh that
[2:32:45] <Deekman> Sekiro actually directly translates to “Broodsouls”
[2:32:48] <candidateplays> That just refers to the Dreg heap, though
[2:32:51] <DRAGKUDO> ooh my god here we go wit this
[2:32:56] <+Bupkis7> BLOODBORNE IS NOT FUTURE DARKSOULS
[2:32:58] <captainthunderwolf> Well, that's fair.
[2:33:00] <cizal11> that's fucking stupid pat
[2:33:00] <+redstonej> How about Breadborne and you fight moldy bread
[2:33:01] <candidateplays> Because the Deep is everywhere there
[2:33:03] <%Keyd00d> sounds like some youtuber theory stuff
[2:33:04] <onlyglaric> hmm
[2:33:04] <%FrostMass22> Aldritch is a Bloodborne
[2:33:05] <OwlLightningMage> The Deep makes so much sense... SwiftRage
[2:33:05] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat's been listening to subreddit theories again
[2:33:06] <DRAGKUDO> Deep is a symbol of Water.
[2:33:06] <DraxTD> ah I see
[2:33:08] <+Xanax44> What about when Father G says Umbasa??
[2:33:09] <gorillahandz> Fuck that it could mean it's a prequel to Endless Ocean or some bullshit, fuck off mate
[2:33:11] <Tevvy> stop watching vaati
[2:33:12] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[2:33:12] <TerraWraith> Then isn't that hint in DS3 and not in BloodBorne?
[2:33:14] <%badchoice5> Fuck Aldritch, he ate the titty godess
[2:33:15] <$KnivesEve> thats a stretch
[2:33:16] <+AXL808> "Plip plop, splish, splash"
[2:33:16] <Parapattern> I would Actually shit if Demon's Souls 2 was ever announced
[2:33:19] <%SuperCasualBoom> The Deepest motherfuckas
[2:33:20] <OwlLightningMage> DS3 LORE IS SO FUCKED UP
[2:33:20] <%FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat Souls and bloodborne are from the same multiverse MAYBE?
[2:33:20] <DRAGKUDO> A world without Fire because it was snuff out by water
[2:33:21] <+Rorinator> Thematic similarities? Must be connected.
[2:33:27] <+Chud_Pudsley> @Deekman Yeah but Sekiro is just a spiritual reincarnation of the Tenchi series
[2:33:27] <%Keyd00d> Seek the Old Theories
[2:33:28] <dekkitout> its an easy theory
[2:33:29] <%FrostMass22> Plip plop, plip plop
[2:33:33] <chimaera24> @AngriestPat except DS3 uses water as a metaphor for the abyss throughout the entire game
[2:33:34] <+Bupkis7> IT'S NOT TRUE PAT IT'S BULLSHIT
[2:33:34] <valdorick> @redstonej You start off as sliced bread, and can either kill bosses to become Toasted, or die, and mold
[2:33:36] <fatalDestiny> See I always assumed the deep water stuff was a reference to a future pirate themed souls game,
[2:33:36] <misterspotswood> HE TRIED TO EAT MY WIFE
[2:33:38] <gorillahandz> Back in the day 2 years ago??
[2:33:41] <Worldbrand> Ariamis symbolizes the Ice Wall
[2:33:44] <cizal11> that's nearly as dumb as fuckin indoctrination theory for mass effect 3
[2:33:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> CALLED OUT
[2:33:46] <zamzoph> What if The Deep is just some vague bullshit that was made up on the spot? 🤔
[2:33:47] <%SergeEXE> Vaati also thinks the things of Light with Wings are the "Angels"
[2:33:48] <Cogito1001> When's are they gonna put Sigmier into Fortnite?
[2:33:49] <%FrostMass22> That was before DS3
[2:33:51] <+sundizzle> can well just agree that dark souls lore is a monster child of what it used to be
[2:33:51] <+WhyIDie> yes, deflect, it makes your argument more legit SeemsGOod
[2:33:53] <+WhyIDie> SeemsGood
[2:33:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Can we get Tsundere Maria- chan
[2:33:53] <%Keyd00d> me too
[2:33:53] <%xxviios> Wat a prick
[2:33:57] <aiyobro> he put Gwynn's son thing on his you kno whatever
[2:33:57] <+Chud_Pudsley> HUGE TITS
[2:33:57] <%forevern2dust> @Parapattern they would have to have all the broken ass weapons it had that were missing from dark souls.
[2:33:58] <Gorgen> 'Plot'
[2:33:59] <%commanderclaw> 90% of souls "lore" is speculation and inference
[2:34:01] <%SergeEXE> GWENEREAR
[2:34:04] <Inebriateddonut> GWYNEREAR
[2:34:04] <%SuperCasualBoom> Dick Souls
[2:34:05] <Worldbrand> he fell
[2:34:06] <+FloorBurger> Paige knows whats up.
[2:34:07] <OwlLightningMage> DS3 LORE MAKES NO SENSE! I AGREE WITH UNCLE PLAGUE
[2:34:08] <flattopswag> It's me
[2:34:09] <%MagickBurritoh> That sky door was the door to bloodborne
[2:34:11] <%wizkid50000> Pat, did you ever finish The Surge?
[2:34:11] <%badchoice5> Goddess of Tits, she was the greatest
[2:34:12] <Cogito1001> HE was Trappin
[2:34:12] <JoeNeutrino> I recommend Sinclair Lore's Bloodborne and Dark Souls lore podcasts with Jerks Sans Frontieres. They are the best-worst podcasts ever.
[2:34:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> jerkin it
[2:34:13] <%seaearthandsky> what was it? guinevrear? LUL
[2:34:13] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> These things can go die, looking at em freaks meout
[2:34:14] <candidateplays> Probably going after Yorksha.
[2:34:14] <mayorrev> dont u dare disrespect gwynevere
[2:34:14] <SkyPirateArcane> That extremely well animated ass
[2:34:15] <+Rhaenarr> Yo don't call our gracious amazing chest a slut
[2:34:17] <Kaitepaints> Ugh, I’m having a super hard night. I got the ptsd triggers
[2:34:19] <Kratok> More like 70
[2:34:19] <gorillahandz> Look fuck all this lore shit just put Priscilla in Smash and end the Souls series on that
[2:34:25] <+heliosvaporizer> I just want a Bayonetta 3 trailer at VGA
[2:34:32] <%forevern2dust> I'm inferring that commander claw is right.
[2:34:34] <+Tylermcd93> That why it's better than almost any other game's lore
[2:34:35] <Intolerable> I wanna motorboat Chloanne just once
[2:34:36] <%badchoice5> And just enough there to prove you wrong
[2:34:37] <+Buytoast> from are practically schizophrenic with how much they jsut throw at a wall to see if it sticks
[2:34:39] <fingalights> Like, why is this guy here
[2:34:44] <turtlesawd> some bullshit is more internally consistent than others tho
[2:34:44] <OwlLightningMage> There's too make shit in 3 you have to make up for yourself
[2:34:46] <captainthunderwolf> Did you know that Bloodborne is actually a DMC1 prequel? You're playing AS Sparda.
[2:34:49] <Deekman> Suicide because he was a worm
[2:34:51] <DrDomVonDoom> No I wanna know the real bullshit
[2:34:56] <+RushUnplugged> now just go sewers and not dungeons, and questline is safe
[2:34:56] <+Foobe> bloodborne is the next painted world.... big if true
[2:34:57] <%OdysseyKnight> What if The Nameless King is just Sans Undertale underneath the armor?
[2:34:58] <+FloorBurger> Put Bonfire-chan in Smash.
[2:34:59] <+Arsimckhoi> i feel like more could have been done with this area it is lacking
[2:35:00] <%badchoice5> But you don't REALLY make a stort
[2:35:01] <OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne is actually the prequel to Undertale
[2:35:05] <FracturedImage> So basically Twin Peaks?
[2:35:07] <dekkitout> isnt that the thing that people hate about destiny's lore
[2:35:09] <+Chud_Pudsley> @captainthunderwolf Thats my new head canon thanks
[2:35:12] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Lady Maria for SMASH
[2:35:13] <valdorick> I got it - next big idea
[2:35:16] <Inebriateddonut> You know what would be great? An Artorias spinoff game by Platinum
[2:35:16] <+potatodono_> We need Blood Born 2 so Vatti can make content again
[2:35:16] <JoeNeutrino> It still made sense if you put all the pices together... until DS3.
[2:35:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> mmmmmm MEEEEeeeee
[2:35:21] <valdorick> Mimic Souls - its Dark Souls, but nothing but mimics
[2:35:24] <DRAGKUDO> Do you think Lady Gaga's recent playthrough of Bayonetta is some kind of marketing for Bayo 3?
[2:35:25] <%xxviios> Miyazaki writes a thing then just takes out huge sections to make it more vague

[2:35:26] <candidateplays> Enh, kinda. You can make logical inferences.
[2:35:26] <%forevern2dust> Déraciné is gonna be the waking world of bloodborne.
[2:35:26] <C_S_N_G> Make a story and then just don’t tell it
[2:35:28] <gorillahandz> Fun fact, Bloodborne is ACTUALLY a prequel to Animal Crossing, because everyone but the Mayor has turned into a furry, which was happening to the people in Bloodborne. cased close fuckbois
[2:35:34] <%THATGUY_789> its a choose your own adventure game

[2:35:41] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mmmm
[2:35:43] <OwlLightningMage> it made sense until you think about it at all even a little bit
[2:35:43] <+TransporterX7> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH
[2:35:44] <+AXL808> It's like designing a world and not adding story elements until after you've made the world

[2:36:33] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige the new Woolie confirmed
[2:36:33] <+SaurianCrash> she gave pat a question she didnt have an answer too
[2:36:35] <RantingRavager> oh no
[2:36:35] <captainthunderwolf> You know, I bet if the smug fucks would built this city hadn't put so much work into making their bridge so pretty, they wouldn't have all died.
[2:36:38] <%badchoice5> Pat is the Ghandi of Humbleness
[2:36:41] <+NaotoKozuki> saw it today it was fine
[2:36:42] <+Bupkis7> PAIGE IS NEITHER BIG NOR STRONG. SHE IS FRAIL AND WEAK

[2:36:45] <+Sozu_> yes big mistake
[2:36:46] <%imextremelymanly> why no one be like wreck it 2
[2:36:49] <+Chud_Pudsley> @AngriestPat How much would you pay to play a DMC game where you're Sparda?
[2:36:50] <lloyddboy> I'd fuck it
[2:36:50] <LixFury> Its the emoji movie but slightly less bad
[2:36:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cutie
[2:36:52] <blademaster247> NO, there is on 1 opinion, and it's wrong
[2:36:52] <captainthunderwolf> These are the actual fucking worse.
[2:36:52] <Cogito1001> It felt like the Emoji movie
[2:36:53] <+Rhaenarr> wreck it ralph was a mistake from the start
[2:36:54] <flattopswag> At least it's not Emoji Movie
[2:36:54] <cizal11> is it paige?
[2:36:54] <%mandragoraroot> WutFace
[2:36:54] <troxcree> From what I've heard it's a film about how hard Disney can blow itself.
[2:36:56] <+AXL808> the general idea is that it's greatly average
[2:36:57] <VeryTricky> he flossed, that makes the movie an auto 0/10
[2:36:58] <dekkitout> a silberfish?
[2:36:59] <Worldbrand> leave house centipedes olone :(
[2:37:02] <+redstonej> husband and wife
[2:37:02] <+ajcritfumble> aah yes, the greater sewer nope
[2:37:05] <%SuperCasualBoom> Wreck it Ralph put Zangief as an evil person...so...
[2:37:07] <Gorgen> are you not talking to one right now?
[2:37:14] <valdorick> A horrifying creature in your house? Time to move again, Pat, burn it all.
[2:37:15] <%mandragoraroot> house centipedes are fucking assholes
[2:37:19] <Graywolf_the_45th> It's a less shit emoji movie
[2:37:19] <indig0bird> She tried to sell donuts
[2:37:19] <%Remery_> Like a coward
[2:37:20] <DavidSanChan> she said feed me wall peeee
[2:37:20] <%bevyrage> it's a sequel, it has donte levels of snide jokes to older ip's
[2:37:20] <%izaich> they just want to hug and kiss you
[2:37:21] <Worldbrand> centipedes are exclusively predatorial so you've probably got something else in there
[2:37:23] <%AncelDeLambert> hair bugs?!
[2:37:24] <%badchoice5> YOUR COWARDICE IS YOUR UNDOING
[2:37:26] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> she a cute
[2:37:26] <%imextremelymanly> big spoil for paige ahead
[2:37:26] <%AncelDeLambert> in house?
[2:37:32] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> I never liked Wreck it Ralph
[2:37:32] <%SuperCasualBoom> Good impression of Paige, Pat.
[2:37:33] <captainthunderwolf> The thing is, it's an expensive work of mediocre effort with internet elements that you'll either hate or be neutral on. Enough money went into it to ensure that it'll always be palatable to a general audience.
[2:37:36] <cizal11> @SuperCasualBoom all grapplers are evil this is known
[2:37:37] <Haruhi_Sujioka> house centipedes are the greatest, very fluffy look them up
[2:37:37] <flattopswag> eh
[2:37:38] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool

[2:37:45] <Cogito1001> What happun?
[2:37:45] <%imextremelymanly> we saw you swing a big stick
[2:37:46] <+FloorBurger> Be careful Paige. If theres two that means theres more.
[2:37:46] <benjiFG> that was dope
[2:37:47] <RutilusMonachus> I didn't see anything, I was looking at Discord
[2:37:48] <iusetheinternet> what happened?
[2:37:49] <lloyddboy> You beat on those women real good Pat
[2:37:49] <shiny_prinny> i looked away
[2:37:50] <%bevyrage> the second act is missing a TON of scenes that were replaced with more superficial bullshit
[2:37:50] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> Hm what? Did Pat do something? Kappa
[2:37:53] <%AncelDeLambert> @angriestpat you probably shouldn't let Paige see ANYTHING upstairs
[2:37:55] <grayjammer> I didnt see shit mang

[2:37:59] <DrDomVonDoom> I didn’t see shit
[2:38:02] <%SuperCasualBoom> That you hit two women at once?
[2:38:10] <%bevyrage> and big massive problems are just ignored
[2:38:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat can beat off any lady in record time
[2:38:14] <%wizkid50000> Pat, did you ever beat The Surge?
[2:38:14] <Worldbrand> someone ate and shat out those ashes
[2:38:18] <%bevyrage> and not brought up again
[2:38:18] <%craig_t> invasions are the worst, fuck this stupid ganking bullshit
[2:38:19] <cizal11> and close your ears
[2:38:23] <%badchoice5> She can't see anything anyways Pat

[2:39:49] <cizal11> @xemnahort you can taunt with a chip, i think it's by turning off and on the flashlight in an enemy's face.

[2:39:51] <Cogito1001> PUSHIT? Reall good.
[2:39:53] <OwlLightningMage> PUSH SHIT REAL GOOD
[2:39:55] <captainthunderwolf> Taunting is a feature you enable with a specific plug-in chip. You flash your flashlight and it makes enemies, giving you a big damage bonus and giving them the same.
[2:39:55] <onlyglaric> No that would be silly
[2:39:58] <%SuperCasualBoom> Pushit real good!! Salt and Pepper here!!

[2:41:02] <%badchoice5> Because you died too many times
[2:41:03] <+RushUnplugged> they forced the fog walls because consoles
[2:41:04] <%imextremelymanly> its a ds3 problem, cannot be helped
[2:41:05] <Josef_Stryker> Exactly enough
[2:41:06] <cizal11> i think you need like 2 more souls lmao
[2:41:07] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Remember when Bloodborne had the BLOODBORNE load screens?
[2:41:07] <+Rhaenarr> That fog wall is a bloodborne reference
[2:41:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> GIVE THAT CHIME TO PICKLE PEEEE!!!
[2:41:14] <captainthunderwolf> @xemnahort 2B's perfect dodge is loose enough that Taunting is usually mad worth the damage bonus. If you get Overclock, you can essentially Za Warudo and destroy the enemies in seconds.
[2:41:16] <%THATGUY_789> suck such dick
[2:41:25] <%mandragoraroot> FrankerZ
[2:41:33] <+king_wragles> Because life is hard, and then you die... or become a toilet.
[2:41:35] <grayjammer> So that its faster to load into the shrine
[2:41:38] <zamzoph> so that people don't have to load the entire level when they just want to do stuff in the one room
[2:41:40] <+Troispoint> all hail console limitations even on platforms who don't have them
[2:41:42] <TerraWraith> Remember when Bloodborne was called PROJECT BEAST! The raddest and coolest name ever
[2:41:48] <OwlLightningMage> Bloodborne's loading times at launch were so scary BibleThump
[2:41:54] <+SaurianCrash> 2B can be customed in SC6
[2:42:05] <captainthunderwolf> Bloodborne's loading times were so bad that the loading screen burned into my fucking TV.
[2:42:10] <%badchoice5> Pat, would you rather be a classic toilet, or a urinal?
[2:42:12] <captainthunderwolf> I still see that brick pattern.
[2:42:18] <Cogito1001> 2B's alt colors are 1000%
[2:42:20] <%imextremelymanly> is 2B already out for SC6
[2:42:28] <dekkitout> the loading screen burned into my eyelids

[2:43:36] <+king_wragles> C'mon Pat, you've got this
[2:43:39] <+king_wragles> we beleive in you
[2:43:41] <+RushUnplugged> don't go to the dungeons, go beat the boss
[2:43:42] <%xemnahort> Are there any plug in chips that cannot stack?
[2:43:52] <%XzileGaming> STUM SUFF SAYS THE STAME
[2:43:53] <onlyglaric> no
[2:43:54] <candidateplays> Gotta beat a boss.
[2:43:55] <+RushUnplugged> or sieg moves forward and rat dies
[2:43:55] <DrDomVonDoom> Thorny as fuck
[2:43:57] <%Sovspot> Not only is paige blind with her eyes but also she suffers from the memory blindness.
[2:43:58] <DraxTD> DO YOU?!
[2:44:01] <lloyddboy> KILLBOSS
[2:44:01] <%SuperCasualBoom> cheer200 If Paige was a superhero, her name would be supercalifragilisticexpialid-lupus. Loving this playthough of Dark Souls 3, Pat. Keep doing God’s work, ya jerk!
[2:44:03] <%badchoice5> Pat speaks like Paige remembers, it fits and spurts and with great difficulty
[2:44:05] <%imextremelymanly> progress even further
[2:44:06] <+Rhaenarr> you gotta beat Mr Suly
[2:44:15] <+RushUnplugged> TIME FOR PARRY
[2:44:19] <captainthunderwolf> @xemnahort Yes, but I can't remember which at the moment. Bear in mind, movement speed actually caps out pretty low, but it's good for a race sidequest/saving time.
[2:44:31] <cizal11> damn he nailed that
[2:44:31] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Stando Powah
[2:44:32] <%Faustgesicht> doesn't beating sully kill grey?
[2:44:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUPUS THE WOLF
[2:44:34] <Cogito1001> If Paige was a superhero she'd literally be starfire
[2:44:38] <+Rorinator> @AngriestPat I think entering the dungeon might kill greirat
[2:44:39] <DraxTD> So I asked you earlier @AngriestPat , but did you get a chance to play Spider man DLC Turf War yet?
[2:44:41] <%mandragoraroot> jermaSun
[2:44:44] <OwlLightningMage> DROP RATE CHIPS OP
[2:44:46] <wsintai> Super Back Down Man!
[2:44:47] <+AXL808> so humble "God works through me!"
[2:44:48] <Cogito1001> Down to the mustard chugging
[2:44:49] <captainthunderwolf> @xemnahort Don't get auto-heal if you want any kind of challenge. Get auto-heal if you do not want any kind of challenge.
[2:44:51] <GypsySnarf> enbSwoleL enbSmug enbSwoleR
[2:44:54] <Caidezes> PONTIFF
[2:44:56] <candidateplays> Can't go into the dungeons. You gotta beat Sulyvahn to save Greirat
[2:44:56] <%xemnahort> @captainthunderwolf do you think invincibility after taking damage stacks?
[2:44:57] <+RushUnplugged> WRONG WAY
[2:45:00] <flattopswag> Well that sucks
[2:45:00] <Bouldus> booo im late, as always :(
[2:45:04] <%badchoice5> YES, IT HAPPENED TO ME
[2:45:06] <%Faustgesicht> i think grey's dead
[2:45:06] <Th1sisstan> through pat all things are possible
[2:45:06] <+Rorinator> @AngriestPat gotta kill sully
[2:45:15] <captainthunderwolf> @xemnahort I believe it does, but it stacks up to a low number.
[2:45:17] <%badchoice5> FUCK THAT QUEST BTW
[2:45:18] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Paige is like if Supergirl wore Kryptonite lip balm
[2:45:26] <+RushUnplugged> grey is fine if onion is around BUT you have to beat a boss before going to the dungeons
[2:45:32] <%imextremelymanly> would it kill him? I though he dies during the journey to the prince
[2:45:35] <LixFury> FeelsBadMan
[2:45:35] <+Nobrev> wew missed 3 hours how long you all think we going tonight

[2:46:17] <OwlLightningMage> PAIGE DOESN'T REMEMBER THIS

[2:46:37] <%mandragoraroot> apatWhat huuuh
[2:46:39] <captainthunderwolf> Look at this room that is literally made of spoilers!
[2:46:39] <+bread_assassin> Just have her put on a blindfold.
[2:46:41] <%imextremelymanly> oh okay. I was always questioning how and when he dies
[2:46:41] <valdorick> Is this, an amazing chest ahead?
[2:46:42] <+Chud_Pudsley> Lookin at dem bitties we seen it
[2:46:44] <%badchoice5> Look, it's a picture of the Tit Goddess
[2:46:44] <+king_wragles> "Paige looked at a spoiler and didn't know it was a spoiler, I should tell her just so she knows it was a spoiler"
[2:46:45] <Josef_Stryker> Oh hey remember that Painted World of the Abyss? Kappa
[2:46:45] <Cogito1001> No more potassium
[2:46:47] <indig0bird> Damn yah it is
[2:46:50] <cizal11> big poise
[2:47:02] <+Rhaenarr> did you ever see the picture of lady nash in that room
[2:47:02] <TerraWraith> I'ma go get food because I haven't eaten in 30+ hours like a dumb
[2:47:03] <+jyrecko> P O I S E
[2:47:05] <%SuperCasualBoom> If Paige was a stand user, her stand would be called Blind Melon.
[2:47:08] <Gorgen> is this Anor Londo?
[2:47:19] <indig0bird> I'm farming Warframe stuff right now
[2:47:27] <Cogito1001> Goldfishgirl
[2:47:28] <flattopswag> @TerraWraith Ah, the college diet
[2:47:38] <+AXL808> Anyone notice the picture of Nashandra on the wall?
[2:47:47] <+jerree66> @Gorgen Yes

[2:48:08] <+bobopipe> cool story pat
[2:48:08] <%AbnormalVoid> fuggins is right
[2:48:08] <%badchoice5> I wish this was DS2 and Pat broke a chest
[2:48:08] <captainthunderwolf> If Paige was a Stand User, her Stand would be called Like a Virgin and it would summon people from chat. DAMN.
[2:48:09] <%XzileGaming> COOL. STORY. BRo
[2:48:15] <candidateplays> There's a painting of the Old Iron King's throne as well
[2:48:15] <OwlLightningMage> Pat's talent for forgetting key details and exaggerating remembered details is on par with Paige's forgetting of details
[2:48:16] <+WhyIDie> oops, all billies
[2:48:18] <%SaltyDongs> billy not billy
[2:48:20] <%xxviios> I blame ADHD for my memory problems

[2:48:23] <%Aitch971> so sans
[2:48:26] <Cogito1001> $10000 dollars in hats spent
[2:48:29] <valdorick> Hey guys, remember DS2, when they thought that, to counter people just hitting the chests to mimic chest, they should make the chests breakable... great design.
[2:48:29] <Gorgen> i still need to get Nova Prime parts
[2:48:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Which Billy loves the anime? is it Billy?
[2:48:37] <%Faustgesicht> how's harrow in the warfraem meta?

[2:48:55] <+SaurianCrash> Suuuper ADHD
[2:48:56] <candidateplays> All you need to do was hit them once, though.
[2:48:56] <Cogito1001> Giberish

[2:50:42] <Gorgen> starter pack was only 7 bucks last weeks
[2:50:45] <+FloorBurger> McDonald's is estus for Paige.
[2:50:46] <+AmaniIsYourBoss> I bet Paige is eating a well balanced meal of healthy green shit. Kappa
[2:50:47] <+timblenaut> its not a free game in practice
[2:50:47] <Inebriateddonut> They literally give you money to play it
[2:50:49] <+JenovasPuppet> Did she order Salad Cauldron?
[2:50:51] <%AncelDeLambert> It's free to your wallet, it only costs your SOUL
[2:50:51] <%badchoice5> But Pat, no one can resist the allure of a shiny hat, so is it "free"?
[2:50:53] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Don't download anything for Playstation unless you hate Crossplay and Big Anime Titties
[2:50:54] <Graywolf_the_45th> You can buy a hat that turns you into a bloodborne
[2:50:58] <Caidezes> Don't say the hat thing Pat. People will think you're serious about having to buy them.
[2:51:05] <+Nobrev> god i'm gonna buy so many hats for my space dolls once my bank card gets to me
[2:51:07] <%Faustgesicht> I could use help hunting eidiolons. never successfully killed one and i want that parasword
[2:51:07] <juxtest> pew pew
[2:51:10] <+SaurianCrash> it doesnt matter for any versions
[2:51:10] <Gorgen> console doesnt have Fortuna and thats it
[2:51:13] <+WhyIDie> you pay them money, and they give you even more money in return
[2:51:13] <+AXL808> It's also basically free money
[2:51:13] <+Zasirel> switch one you can transfer too...

[2:51:21] <valdorick> You can play a Frame that use to turn you into Dio, but it only turns into half a Dio now.
[2:51:27] <kite1haseo> ???
[2:51:28] <+revrendike> That was great.
[2:51:28] <%AncelDeLambert> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[2:51:28] <%Tarantulawl> On a related note, the Switch version is only 13 gigs, somehow
[2:51:30] <NiftyNox> vineBlind
[2:51:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:51:30] <+king_wragles> Hey, do you guys think that Sans Warframe will get into Smash?
[2:51:34] <candidateplays> lionBaby lionBaby
[2:51:36] <%mandragoraroot> vineBlind
[2:51:36] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I really wish I could migrate my Xbox account to my PC
[2:51:38] <%forevern2dust> is warframe's combat actually challenging?
[2:51:38] <mayorrev> @AngriestPat can confirm, switch port is dope. missing some stuff but it;'s scheduled to come later
[2:51:40] <OwlLightningMage> I miss going full Dio with Limbo BibleThump
[2:51:40] <dekkitout> ps4 and xb also have mkb support for warframe if you really give a damn
[2:51:44] <+FloorBurger> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:51:45] <Gorgen> @Enemy_In_Disguise SAME
[2:51:53] <OwlLightningMage> Limbo is still cool though
[2:51:56] <+king_wragles> I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT TENNO ASSIST TROPHIES AND AM NOW WAY TOO PUMPED
[2:52:01] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat did you see that the Switch port has legit graphics options? you can turn on/off ambient occlusion, DOF, HDR, and a few other settings
[2:52:06] <Gorgen> eventually i want to migrate to PC but i dont want to leave my 12 prime frames behind
[2:52:07] <%badchoice5> Like when you pack a knife in your pocket, that's a short cut
[2:52:08] <%imextremelymanly> all i know is that the dlc for smash will have another RARE character
[2:52:10] <DrDomVonDoom> I also indulge in Switchframe it is gud
[2:52:11] <%mandragoraroot> heeh
[2:52:12] <%SuperCasualBoom> Okay, I’ll d/l it later. Too busy watching my favorite streamer...unseen Paige.
[2:52:12] <captainthunderwolf> You guys ever wonder what generic magic bolts are supposed to feel like? Like Soul Arrow, what is that? Does it just hurt like an arrow? Does it burn? Is it cold? I'd assume it's like solid fire, but maybe it just HURTS you.
[2:52:12] <%XzileGaming> HANH?
[2:52:13] <flattopswag> Same with her mustard-drinking
[2:52:20] <+Rhaenarr> Gwynevere is the next Smash character with that amazing chest
[2:52:24] <%mandragoraroot> jermaFear
[2:52:25] <ShadowZiggy> Hey all
[2:52:25] <Cogito1001> The Switch has HDR?
[2:52:26] <%SaltyDongs> PAIGE IS EVIL
[2:52:28] <%AncelDeLambert> you EXIST! HERETIC!
[2:52:29] <ShadowZiggy> Hope everyone is well
[2:52:29] <+LogothX> Nice to see you off screen paige
[2:52:37] <%camodikk> Key to Eidilon hunting is lvlning. getting a decent Amp and making sure your warframe weapons deal Radiation\
[2:52:43] <+ajcritfumble> fuck this next room
[2:52:44] <Josef_Stryker> What level is Pat's hammer?
[2:52:47] <blademaster247> Paige has already forgotten who is scared by her lack of memory
[2:52:50] <+ajcritfumble> i hate these dudes
[2:52:57] <DrDomVonDoom> Don’t let it sink in.
[2:52:59] <Gorgen> Lanka is a good weapon for Eidilons
[2:53:02] <%Faustgesicht> Next smash character is Custer from Custer's Revenge
[2:53:08] <%xemnahort> @blademaster247 how scary
[2:53:18] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> fuck that table
[2:53:20] <+AXL808> That's because Paige spends most of her time in a trance like state like Master Willem from Bloodborne
[2:53:21] <%SuperCasualBoom> If Paige was a song it be “Don’t you forget about me”.
[2:53:22] <%XzileGaming> @Faustgesicht dude, thats just wrong
[2:53:26] <captainthunderwolf> @ajcritfumble Why would you hate the invisible swarming enemies who have an annoying flurry attack and more health than you expect?
[2:53:27] <%Faustgesicht> yes
[2:53:33] <+LogothX> I thought he said Blanka is a good weapon for Eidolons.
[2:53:37] <+Rhaenarr> @Faustgesicht im pretty sure its Moon Presence
[2:53:37] <%XzileGaming> LUL
[2:53:41] <OwlLightningMage> Lanka is so good
[2:53:47] <RenegadeEpsilon> pats got hooooooeeeeeeessssss
[2:53:49] <+WhyIDie> can pretty much solo eidolons with a lanka on chroma or rhino
[2:53:51] <%badchoice5> Time to carry Anri
[2:53:51] <Gorgen> Lanka needs a better model
[2:53:51] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat Fuck.
[2:53:53] <+AXL808> it's a statue
[2:53:55] <mayorrev> @Solidus_113 i actually turned off bloom and some other graphics stuff and it does actually smooth out frames a bit
[2:54:02] <%imextremelymanly> this game needs more GUN
[2:54:02] <mayorrev> so thats good :]
[2:54:03] <Bouldus> lol
[2:54:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hot
[2:54:06] <Deekman> Peach saying it like that reminds me of the episode of the Simpsons where Moe gets a lobotomy in Flanders world.
[2:54:07] <blademaster247> @AngriestPat Do you guys avoid talking about Fallout 76's shitshow because they sponsor the podcast?
[2:54:07] <+ajcritfumble> fuck the lanka this comment broght to you by the vectis gang
[2:54:09] <VeryTricky> whats the easiest way to not get super overwhelmed by all the stuff in warframe?
[2:54:15] <%badchoice5> Paige is falling apart on stream
[2:54:18] <dekkitout> a wiki
[2:54:19] <DrDomVonDoom> Blanka stance.
[2:54:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> PAIGE, this is a CHRISTIAN stream
[2:54:24] <Shining_Armor> @VeryTricky Don't play...or interact with the community/wiki
[2:54:28] <flattopswag> I'm sure this is a common question, but what's the Warframe time sink like? A lot of grinding or no?
[2:54:28] <cizal11> overwhelmed is kinda just how warframe is
[2:54:28] <+FloorBurger> Dont look at Lanka users and dont talk to Lanka users.
[2:54:29] <DrDomVonDoom> Lewd
[2:54:29] <OwlLightningMage> Wiki but avoid spoilers
[2:54:34] <Gorgen> "No.."
[2:54:34] <captainthunderwolf> @VeryTricky Guides. There's a guide for everything somewhere.
[2:54:36] <Cogito1001> im confused at what im supposed to be doing in Warframe so i just go through onslaught repeatedly. Usually make it to 15-17 before i get bodied but its fun at least.
[2:54:37] <Inebriateddonut> @VeryTricky take things slow and ask questions
[2:54:39] <Nighthawkmun> Nice got home in time to catch someof the stream
[2:54:39] <+mgskomododragon> Vectors RISE UP
[2:54:42] <+Ciphris> where my rubico sisters at
[2:54:47] <+RushUnplugged> Lanka or Rubico Prime eat eidolons, vectis and vulkar are good too but not as much
[2:54:50] <%BrazenMask> who is christian and when this become his stream?
[2:54:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat is working, paige
[2:55:02] <+MarshallLee67> rubico prime is nutty
[2:55:03] <+WhyIDie> at least everyone can agree tigris prime is the best sniper

[2:55:13] <+Ciphris> i was using rubico before it got cool with the prime version
[2:55:16] <+RushUnplugged> rubico prime is NUTS if you can combo some hits

[2:56:35] <cizal11> lmao
[2:56:35] <Laecerelius> I found Destiny 2 to be generally way more boring than Warframe. Shooting guns felt nice but everything else was meh at best.

[2:57:34] <Cogito1001> Saryn with Octavia's animations is also 1000%
[2:57:37] <+RushUnplugged> Destiny is a fancy car that runs ok but it's just "ok, Warframe is a muscle car that goes nuts at times but it's always fun
[2:57:37] <Shining_Armor> @Breakfast_Megapowers That's a good question! Pat should get married to tell us.
[2:57:40] <gameaholic42> Paige.exe has stopped working
[2:57:43] <misterspotswood> @PlagueOfGripes what are your thoughts on government funding being put towards making monster girls

[2:58:36] <Worldbrand> it just feels neat
[2:58:39] <misterspotswood> do the thing where you just lay down between the two statues and dont take hits
[2:58:44] <Worldbrand> Dex
[2:58:45] <+eshafferart> Dex sybaris
[2:58:45] <Deekman> Are bosses considered to actually be that large or is it just a metaphor for their power level?
[2:58:46] <VeryTricky> i would have beat pontiff first try if i didnt try to parry during his second phase like an idiot
[2:58:47] <OwlLightningMage> Shy loves both
[2:58:47] <+eshafferart> in my opinion
[2:58:47] <+RushUnplugged> but everything will end when we get Opticor Vandal
[2:58:48] <+jestrfestr> sybaris is fun to use
[2:58:52] <Shining_Armor> Pat seems like the kind of guy who would get married, not say anything to anyone, and let the community think he was still dating until one day someone just happens to catch a view of his ring and then he's like 'Oh yeah I got married 2 years ago."

[3:04:11] <dekkitout> welcome to the real mans anor londo
[3:04:12] <%badchoice5> Sully: 4, Smashy-boi: 0
[3:04:15] <Worldbrand> breathing room: no
[3:04:15] <Cogito1001> Pat youre not Rhino prime
[3:04:16] <Caidezes> Try dodging.
[3:04:16] <+Arsimckhoi> summon anri you dope
[3:04:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> now you see why everyone says just parry him. shit boss
[3:04:19] <Nighthawkmun> Roll into his dick
[3:04:21] <Cogito1001> dodge
[3:04:24] <ArtThouBored> Do you need to go Robot like Paige did with Gwyn?
[3:04:24] <OwlLightningMage> Never stopping attacking is the best boss design
[3:04:25] <Inebriateddonut> Pat you should switch out to tigris to oneshot him
[3:04:25] <+NoirePanzer> Have you tried dodging him?
[3:04:27] <%hawk_rush> nah, this boss is awesome
[3:04:28] <Hydrapissed> yeah parry or hyper armor bout it
[3:04:34] <%Divryne> Try not getting hit.
[3:04:34] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Attack his weak point to inflict MASSIVE damage
[3:04:35] <cizal11> he attacks as much as 2 bosses hmmmmmm
[3:04:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i believe in you patty!!
[3:04:37] <%hawk_rush> you don't need to parry him
[3:04:39] <xeros720> Robo Paige is still near and dear to my heart
[3:04:40] <Th1sisstan> pat is like an altar boy the way he keeps getting poked by the pontiff
[3:04:40] <Josef_Stryker> Sounds like someone is salty
[3:04:41] <+LogothX> He has weird slow swings that fuck with your timing
[3:04:42] <Basch71> never really parried him, just dodged and hit
[3:04:45] <Hydrapissed> yeah u beat him last time via huge and a rapier
[3:04:46] <NiftyNox> Its a shame they didn't give Sulyvahn more screentime before his fight, cuz based on everything you learn AFTER him he's basically the most important figure to the entire lore
[3:04:46] <%badchoice5> Beat him in your heart Pat, then you will beat him in the game
[3:04:46] <+Press_X_ToJASON> yeah, same
[3:04:48] <Worldbrand> Did you have a shield back then?
[3:04:48] <Josef_Stryker> TBF u were using an Estoc and were huge af
[3:04:49] <%Divryne> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:04:50] <+Zombiemowlcher> I think it's the big slow mace
[3:04:50] <TerraWraith> Reduce his health to zero before he reduces your health to zero.
[3:04:52] <+FloorBurger> Slow it down
[3:04:55] <+Elexius> you're being too aggresssive i think
[3:04:57] <cizal11> you were using a much faster weapon
[3:04:58] <+Press_X_ToJASON> big slow mace = bad time
[3:04:58] <SirDogBear> you gotta hug it out to win
[3:05:00] <ceasefireiscool> popes can be defeated if you just write 95 thesis
[3:05:04] <ashen_smithy> ds3 was kinder to str builds than ds2 was but not by much
[3:05:08] <%shabop> parry that boy
[3:05:09] <+king_wragles> parry this punk
[3:05:11] <juxtest> Hit him with the pointy end of the mace
[3:05:13] <valdorick> Step 1 - go Limbo, step 2 - press 1, step 3 - press 2, step 4 - Tigrus him in the face until it stops being funny.
[3:05:14] <Pookiedaexzile> I see the problem try notbdodging face firstbat the flaming or glowing swords
[3:05:15] <+JenovasPuppet> At least the run is easy
[3:05:24] <Hydrapissed> I mean that weapon art he has on that mace is pretty damn good
[3:05:28] <%Divryne> BONK.
[3:05:30] <Basch71> did this fight with a Dante gimmick build, shit was fun
[3:05:31] <+Zombiemowlcher> Did they fix poise?
[3:05:33] <ArcanumMBD> BIG COMBO
[3:05:35] <+JenovasPuppet> Jesus fuck that attack pattern
[3:05:35] <%badchoice5> Sully: 5, Smashy-boi: 0
[3:05:37] <Josef_Stryker> @ashen_smithy I disagree there. Strength Builds were extremely good in DS2 especially hammers
[3:05:37] <ArcanumMBD> HE DO BIG COMBO
[3:05:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> big slow weapons just... I don't know, they're more for supporting in this fight?
[3:05:41] <cizal11> should've sprinted away from the big combo
[3:05:42] <tykai1> you challenge a lot of his attacks that you should either just dodge or parry
[3:05:42] <%kenpachi9211> DEATH COUNT 55
[3:05:42] <+0range_> Come on pat its a DPS race Kappa
[3:05:42] <ziggbuttz> my cat is loving watching you die, pat
[3:05:42] <%SaltyDongs> doing good buddy
[3:05:43] <%shabop> his first attack is mad easy to parry
[3:05:45] <dekkitout> i will not stand for kirito ass to be tonights wall
[3:05:46] <Cogito1001> Strafe diagonally towards his left or right
[3:05:47] <cjmk9> He has a stand that the pc can see, does that mean the pc has a stand?
[3:05:49] <%Sirculbs> Time to panic? Time to panic
[3:05:49] <DRAGKUDO> is it me or does the beginning of Pontiff's theme sound like something from Kingdom Hearts?
[3:05:50] <jossahmol> wow that's rough
[3:05:53] <Shining_Armor> Hey Pat, what's a good fighting game for beginners? I bought Skull Girls when it was like a dollar and while the tutorial in very in depth, it's community is not really...beginner friendly?
[3:05:53] <critikal_bit> Just use negotiation like in your Persona games
[3:05:54] <dashmatt> Staminaz
[3:05:59] <+thebestestkevin> @ashen_smithy yeah i completely disagree with that statement
[3:06:02] <oponomo2> pontiff bois
[3:06:02] <candidateplays> You can use big weapons in this fight. AGS absolutely destroys him.
[3:06:03] <DrDomVonDoom> Try tongue, but hole
[3:06:04] <Cogito1001> Try using your 4
[3:06:05] <+yourunclesmorningpaper> Daddy pontiff
[3:06:06] <aiyobro> I beat him lol
[3:06:12] <%Faustgesicht> just shoot him with gun
[3:06:14] <+sgtlaggy> just parry Kappa
[3:06:15] <Cthulos> Hey, come on!
[3:06:15] <Gorgen> this boss keeps beating Pat off
[3:06:18] <Inebriateddonut> try using your operator
[3:06:20] <SirDogBear> put a gun on that hammer and everything will be solved
[3:06:20] <stigna1> Hey, I've heard of this game!
[3:06:25] <ashen_smithy> aight would it be more accurate to say it was less kind to heavy weapon builds?
[3:06:26] <Cthulos> Get serious!
[3:06:26] <ArcanumMBD> parrying in this fight is for cowards who don't like fun fights
[3:06:27] <Hydrapissed> parry or wep art
[3:06:28] <+Zombiemowlcher> He cant parry with both of his hands firmly grasping his shaft
[3:06:29] <Worldbrand> JUST TALK
[3:06:29] <+JenovasPuppet> Have you tried killing him instead of dying?
[3:06:31] <%OlCaptainRed> thats a big stick
[3:06:31] <%Divryne> Just kill him in one hit.
[3:06:34] <Shining_Armor> Anyone else is also free to answer that question
[3:06:36] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This is the Crash Bandicoot of the series

[3:08:27] <%badchoice5> I can't believe how many hits Pat can take
[3:08:29] <+LogothX> or
[3:08:31] <+Dragoneye77> he says this as he nearly dies
[3:08:31] <%Big_Dream> once he goes anime he becomes weaker
[3:08:32] <Basch71> he's not rushing you down constantly thats why
[3:08:32] <ArcanumMBD> he attacks MUCH slower, and the stand acts as a big telegraph

[3:12:23] <+Krasmeyts> Its ANDOR LANDO!
[3:12:24] <TerraWraith> This menu I mean

[3:13:12] <%thunderdutch> Anal Gonbdor time!
[3:13:12] <+king_wragles> Paige awakens from a mountain of Wic Donalds
[3:13:13] <%xemnahort> @badchoice5 casting starts off pretty bad at the start but gets better after you find orbeck but I haven’t reached sully yet and I think I’ll use a lot of Farron flashsword more than anything else
[3:13:15] <%badchoice5> JUST THROW IT ON THE FLOOR PAIGE ITS YOUR HOUSE
[3:13:18] <+AXL808> she throwing shit on the floor again isn't she!!
[3:13:21] <blademaster247> I was expecting her to throw it at you
[3:13:26] <+Nobrev> @AngriestPat have you tried the switch version of warframe at all?
[3:13:32] <%DedlokPM> @RushUnplugged literally just went up and talked to him
[3:13:33] <OwlLightningMage> PAIGE SHIT ON THE COUCH
[3:13:36] <%badchoice5> @xemnahort Sully is a motherfucker as a caster
[3:13:36] <Shining_Armor> Is Paige high?
[3:13:37] <%SaltyDongs> she peed on it
[3:13:37] <Jontman42> Paige pooped on the couch?
[3:13:37] <+RushUnplugged> oh derp
[3:13:38] <valdorick> "Do things"
[3:13:39] <FoulNightingale> what I miss?
[3:13:40] <dekkitout> shes right, you know
[3:13:41] <Liwyn> is that anor londo
[3:13:42] <oponomo2> is that Angelina Jolie besides skeletor?
[3:13:42] <blademaster247> Is Paige ok?
[3:13:42] <%Sharkfighter9000> SHE POOPED ON THE COUCH
[3:13:43] <+king_wragles> PAIGE GOT DRUNK AND SHAT THE COUCH
[3:13:44] <%Sharkfighter9000> AGAIN
[3:13:45] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige is poopy
[3:13:47] <RutilusMonachus> Paige, stop pooping on the couch!
[3:13:48] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Paige has good aim for a blind lady
[3:13:49] <Antrodox> not again
[3:14:03] <%OdysseyKnight> Waow
[3:14:04] <Jontman42> No not on stream
[3:14:05] <DavidSanChan> cup o zebra juice spilled
[3:14:05] <dekkitout> is not shit, its chocolate
[3:14:10] <+LogothX> There's no such thing as a COVERT SHIT. If someone shits themself you're going to smell it.
[3:14:10] <%Sharkfighter9000> stay classy, Internet
[3:14:11] <Cthulos> Or butt chocolate the couch
[3:14:12] <Josef_Stryker> Pat, u find his spells from the Painted World it only makes sense he's a painting denizen
[3:14:12] <%Tarantulawl> Don't poop on the couch! Use the fart closet!
[3:14:13] <%Faustgesicht> banned for poop cries
[3:14:14] <Shining_Armor> The couple that lacks shame
[3:14:15] <+Bloodxb> painted world yes bird person no
[3:14:16] <chimaera24> Is Paige high?
[3:14:17] <$rdark_ksu> paige if you shit yourself you would be so red a tomato would be jealous
[3:14:18] <%badchoice5> That's true, Paige is notoriously public about her bathroom activities
[3:14:18] <+sundizzle> pontiff left the painted world, it's heavily implied
[3:14:20] <Cogito1001> Aw man she shit the couch, I liked that couch, really bought the room together,
[3:14:22] <+RushUnplugged> also, Pestilent Mercury makes any boss a joke, caster life is ez
[3:14:22] <OwlLightningMage> Paige is like a toddler with less aim
[3:14:25] <%AncelDeLambert> Pontiff can't be one of the bird people, he has arms
[3:14:27] <nelsonq415> good evening pat
[3:14:39] <+king_wragles> Birds have arms, they use them to fly
[3:14:39] <Josef_Stryker> @RushUnplugged Pestilent Mercury on Midir is a godsend
[3:14:51] <+RushUnplugged> he just melts
[3:14:52] <cowunstoppable> Hey Pat, you ever try modded runs?
[3:14:53] <%xemnahort> @badchoice5 then again I was thinking of sorceries but my miracle caster would have a great time, defense spells and regen plus executioners to get fo back I’d outlast him
[3:14:55] <oponomo2> ds3 is so gud. never gets old
[3:15:02] <SirDogBear> thats the one thing i like about ds more than bb, the spell casting, especially pyro. using bullets for spells did not scratch that itch
[3:15:05] <%Faustgesicht> and now this jackass
[3:15:06] <ceasefireiscool> maybe paige is always confused because m they always stream at 1am and she's just tired
[3:15:08] <candidateplays> He's more like a Pilgrim than a corvian
[3:15:13] <OwlLightningMage> Pontiff is probably Ariandel's kid or something stupid like that because DS3 lore.
[3:15:17] <FoulNightingale> I just installed warframe for the first time since 2013...
[3:15:21] <kazadog> hes going to the donjon
[3:15:25] <Inebriateddonut> It's DS2 man
[3:15:27] <Jontman42> It's 8 am here and I just woke up, how about there?
[3:15:27] <%AncelDeLambert> man I HATE this guy
[3:15:30] <tykai1> @AngriestPat or anyone what do you think of the KirkHammer in bloodborne, doing my first run with in and am in the dlc now
[3:15:32] <+AXL808> Poor bastard lost Zullie
[3:15:36] <%badchoice5> Alva isn't as good as his armor, confirmed
[3:15:37] <+sundizzle> alva is so fucking cool
[3:15:38] <valdorick> Oh look, its Alva, the Iconic Armor man of Dark Souls 2! Or something
[3:15:40] <cizal11> geez almost bought it
[3:15:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool weapon art
[3:15:43] <OwlLightningMage> KIRKHAMMER IS MY BAE
[3:15:53] <OwlLightningMage> THE KIRKHAMMER IS A GOOD WEAPON
[3:15:54] <candidateplays> But it's the same transformation happening to everything. People turning into the age of ancients stuff.
[3:15:54] <Caidezes> Alva's the best.
[3:15:55] <Josef_Stryker> @AXL808 At least they pseudo reunite in Ringed City
[3:15:58] <%Afancymoose> @angriestpat /other scrublords, y’all played Let It Die?
[3:16:00] <+Elexius> rip headphone users incoming
[3:16:02] <%Sharkfighter9000> I feel like Paige is a victim; she tried to poop but the game was set to invert Y-axis, and a sofa just got in the way
[3:16:04] <dekkitout> oooooooh Boy
[3:16:07] <+Buytoast> did he win the stand battle?
[3:16:09] <Josef_Stryker> Brace your ears everyone
[3:16:10] <valdorick> WELP! PTSD time
[3:16:14] <%Faustgesicht> and it's pats basement.
[3:16:14] <cizal11> kirkhammer is ok but tbh it's totally outclassed by the ludwig holysword
[3:16:15] <NiftyNox> @tykai1 I did a run that was entirely hammer mode, it can be tough sometimes, especially against Kos, but damn is it FUN
[3:16:18] <Josef_Stryker> WE IN A HORROR GAME NOW BOYS
[3:16:19] <flyingtarantulaz> NEW YU YU HAKUSHO OVA OUT!!
[3:16:20] <inksmears> Are dark spirits another player?
[3:16:20] <Shining_Armor> @Sharkfighter9000 I laughed harder than I should. I hate you.
[3:16:21] <+sundizzle> WutFace
[3:16:21] <+AXL808> the scream!
[3:16:22] <+TheSaintJohn> This place isn't my favorite, that's for sure :|

[3:16:27] <JoeNeutrino> WutFace
[3:16:27] <+RushUnplugged> JUMPSCARES TIME
[3:16:28] <cizal11> LMAO
[3:16:29] <+AParkedChopper> So like, I don't like ds2 at all and I'm thinking of skipping straight to ds3. Is that a bad idea?
[3:16:31] <cowunstoppable> !jump scared!
[3:16:32] <+king_wragles> I forgot about that FUCKING SCREAM
[3:16:32] <+phatmac16> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[3:16:35] <benjiFG> i wanted pat to get scared
[3:16:46] <Haruhi_Sujioka> absolutely love this place, nice and comf
[3:16:48] <ceasefireiscool> every time i read bonfire lit i think it says bonfire, lit
[3:16:49] <FoulNightingale> THE FUCKING FORTUNA MUSIC JUST STARTED UP AND IT WAS THE MOST APPROPRIATE THING EVER. Sorry for yelling
[3:16:53] <%hawk_rush> @AngriestPat Can you and Paige play Visage?
[3:16:54] <%xemnahort> @inksmears mostly yes but there are npc invasions like the one who almost killed pat back there
[3:16:55] <oponomo2> pat, did u forget ds3 details?
[3:16:55] <+AXL808> cheap ass scare that never shows up again
[3:16:55] <+sundizzle> this place might be the worst in all of souls
[3:16:59] <+LogothX> Dark Souls 2 is the DMC 2 of Dark Souls
[3:16:59] <Josef_Stryker> Still the worst part about Irityll Dungeon is the Gollum-Dragon Hybrids
[3:17:00] <+thebestestkevin> @AParkedChopper why dont you like it?
[3:17:01] <Josef_Stryker> Creepy fucks
[3:17:02] <+phatmac16> SHUT THE FUCK UP ELMO
[3:17:03] <+Salvation122> Dungeons usually are
[3:17:04] <SirDogBear> pat survived 7 shitstorms, he aint scared of anything anymore
[3:17:06] <tykai1> I love the kirkhammer but it is very situational. i could not use it at all again the Holy Blade boss (not revealing name)
[3:17:08] <Jontman42> Some rough shit went down here
[3:17:10] <+RushUnplugged> @AParkedChopper if you're not feeling it at all, sure, but it's not THAT bad of a game
[3:17:10] <+sana_kan> @AParkedChopper nah I don't think so, if you're really not feeling ds2 there's no reason you can't skip over it
[3:17:13] <%AncelDeLambert> a DRAGON shithole
[3:17:13] <dekkitout> oh THESE guys
[3:17:13] <+Buytoast> if you go sorcery DS2 is alot more bearable
[3:17:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hahaha
[3:17:16] <valdorick> That's nice seared ass there, Pat
[3:17:17] <+Ciphris> BRANDED
[3:17:19] <%AncelDeLambert> REKT
[3:17:20] <+LogothX> Getting hit with a brand knocks you down
[3:17:22] <%Faustgesicht> holy dick good survive
[3:17:23] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat branded
[3:17:23] <+Devilbringer133> Yeah this place ain't the best
[3:17:25] <+Bloodxb> who needs a healthbar
[3:17:25] <%camodikk> 500+ hours in this game and i may have to download again and try a new build
[3:17:25] <cowunstoppable> i mean play what you enjoy, but ds2 is honestly a good game
[3:17:26] <+bobopipe> They reduce your max hp!?
[3:17:27] <+AXL808> Who like their Pat extra crispy?
[3:17:27] <Josef_Stryker> @LogothX Ok that's harsh, it's more like DMC4 where it's incomplete in some areas
[3:17:28] <DrDomVonDoom> dark souls is the blood borne of Demons Souls
[3:17:35] <%AncelDeLambert> the Jailers are the WORST!
[3:17:36] <%xemnahort> @buytoast magic is so good in ds2
[3:17:43] <OwlLightningMage> Kirkhammer is good against all things.
[3:17:43] <+RushUnplugged> ds2 is the worst of the series but it's an 8 in a series of 9s
[3:17:43] <+phatmac16> Ooh god this place suckkksss
[3:17:44] <candidateplays> DS2 is not like DMC2. That's ridiculous.
[3:17:45] <dekkitout> i believe the brand reads "Property of Dwight."
[3:17:52] <flyingtarantulaz> probably reeboot of the old yu yu show
[3:17:55] <OwlLightningMage> Kirkhammer is love. Kirkhammer is life
[3:17:58] <tykai1> KirkHammer is God
[3:17:59] <+LogothX> That run cycle is goofy
[3:18:00] <Liwyn> he branded you with the indian logo from beyond
[3:18:01] <+G_Thunders> I’d say Demons Souls’ version of this area was way worse. Tower of Latria
[3:18:04] <%axellogic> Quick everyone take Pat's health
[3:18:04] <valdorick> Man, look at all that Health pat has, would be a shame if it WASN'T THERE BASED ON PERCENTS
[3:18:06] <%waddledoops> hey i got here just in time for the absolute worst level of the game
[3:18:09] <cizal11> lmao it ate total shit
[3:18:10] <+AXL808> i like their little shuffle though
[3:18:10] <stigna1> Jokes on the jailors; can't drain me if everything oneshots me already! Haha
[3:18:11] <LtThunderbolt> jailer sailor
[3:18:15] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Shimmy
[3:18:16] <oponomo2> kill all the undead HotPokket
[3:18:16] <TerraWraith> I typically play all dodges and low vit, so the place was damn near impossible without a respec
[3:18:16] <ArtThouBored> Kirkhammer is a good

[3:18:23] <+king_wragles> FUCK
[3:18:26] <%mandragoraroot> vineHard
[3:18:27] <cizal11> @waddledoops no izalith was at the start of the stream
[3:18:28] <Shining_Armor> That is pretty loud
[3:18:29] <LtThunderbolt> LAWL
[3:18:34] <kite1haseo> D:
[3:18:38] <+Elexius> why is fromsoft so cruel
[3:18:39] <Jontman42> That works I guess
[3:18:39] <%xemnahort> @rushunplugged my opinion is almost the same as yours but I switch ds2 with ds1, yeah I’m weird deal with it
[3:18:40] <gorillahandz> DS2 is the weakest of the series but it's still leaps and bounds better than anything Deck13 has made
[3:18:41] <+phatmac16> :(
[3:18:46] <+thebestestkevin> i find that a lot of hate on ds2 is pretty hypocritical when ds3 does the same things, but even worse. Yet ds3 gets praised to high heaven
[3:18:57] <+AParkedChopper> @thebestestkevin I just really dislike most of the changes from ds1 like the hollowing system and health consumables. There's cool shit in there but it really feels like Diet Dark Souls imo
[3:19:04] <FoulNightingale> Holy shit my frost prime is still here!
[3:19:04] <+RushUnplugged> @xemnahort I get it, ds1 has some bad jank in retrospect
[3:19:06] <stigna1> DSII iss the hill that I will die on; 2 was fantastic.
[3:19:09] <%waddledoops> @cizal11 I actually didnt have that much trouble there as compared to this shit hole
[3:19:10] <Thalchampz> shit's locked
[3:19:10] <Josef_Stryker> @thebestestkevin It's because it's directed by Miyazaki who we know can do no wrong
[3:19:10] <ziggbuttz> They make wendigo noises!! BibleThump
[3:19:11] <%Afancymoose> The force of Pats ass hitting the ground killed that guy without even touching him lmao
[3:19:12] <+AXL808> too bad the lighting on these enemies give the real ones away
[3:19:14] <ceasefireiscool> the boots pats character is wearing reminds me of paige's hooker boots
[3:19:14] <candidateplays> Dark souls 2 is honestly more like DMC4, what with the rushed production. Although without the absurd depth of combat.
[3:19:22] <benjiFG> ! leeched !
[3:19:26] <SirDogBear> i thought people loved the gameplay of ds2 like don't people still pvp or something to this day?
[3:19:28] <+Buytoast> you'll have to elaborate on what it does worse, because DS2's janky and sluggish animations are abyssmal
[3:19:28] <%Faustgesicht> sweet maggots bruh
[3:19:29] <%xemnahort> @rushunplugged they’ve all made mistakes but we still love em
[3:19:34] <+redanimator> max needs 4th blacout
[3:19:35] <oponomo2> girls dood
[3:19:37] <Josef_Stryker> @candidateplays Does that make SOTFS DMC4SE?
[3:19:38] <Jontman42> DS2 would've been fine if it was called King's Souls or something like that
[3:19:39] <DrDomVonDoom> DS2 had Lucatiel and she is best girl
[3:19:44] <valdorick> Lords of the Fallen is the DMC2 of Dark Souls Kappa
[3:19:45] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Gross mart forever
[3:19:54] <%hawk_rush> pvp is considered the best in ds
[3:19:54] <Shining_Armor> 1 damage away
[3:19:55] <+tussletoes> I’ll say it again, warning hot tale
[3:19:56] <ArtThouBored> DS2 has a beautiful Hub Theme though
[3:19:56] <%hawk_rush> *ds2
[3:19:57] <%n33t_1337> DS3 has the worst mechanics
[3:19:58] <cizal11> 70.1 lmao
[3:19:58] <Inebriateddonut> @SirDogBear it's pretty widley accepted that ds2 pvp is the best in the series
[3:19:59] <flyingtarantulaz> @angriestpat Yusuke is back
[3:20:06] <OwlLightningMage> I love that everyone has their favorite and hated souls games LUL
[3:20:19] <+AParkedChopper> It's just a shitton of knit picks that compound into a really unsatisfactory experience
[3:20:24] <%xemnahort> @valdorick lords of the fallen does have an easy mode build so I guess it is
[3:20:24] <Thalchampz> wow that was bullshit
[3:20:24] <+sundizzle> you know whats a fun mechanic? equip a torch to stop the bleeding because fuck you
[3:20:26] <SirDogBear> yea thats what i thought @Inebriateddonut i definitely missed power stances though made me feel special when i met requirements lol
[3:20:26] <%AncelDeLambert> he doesn't have any firebombs?
[3:20:28] <+RushUnplugged> "pvp is the best in ds1" is something only people who still jerkoff to giantdad can say
[3:20:29] <+tussletoes> *hot take: dark souls 2 is, thematically a better sequel than 3 and far more memorable imo
[3:20:46] <cizal11> @Inebriateddonut it has lots of builds, but the movement is so fucking bad that pvping still sucks ass
[3:20:48] <%Afancymoose> Oh damn thems fighting words
[3:20:48] <+LogothX> I had a lot of fun in DS2 cosplaying as Geese Howard
[3:20:49] <TerraWraith> I like all the Souls games equally. They all have points in them where they are fundamentally fucked for a bit.
[3:20:49] <+thebestestkevin> 1) constant references to ds1, 2) any build thats not sword and board was terrible for a long time, 3) spellcasting is still garbage in ds3, 4) like plague said theres a lot of over aggressive annoying bosses
[3:20:54] <+thebestestkevin> just to name a few
[3:20:57] <+sundizzle> @tussletoes kinda agree with you
[3:20:58] <DrDomVonDoom> Dark souls 2 was my first souls game so it will always have a place in my heart
[3:20:59] <%SergeEXE> Once again, just my theory. Also, the devs tagged the angel-like enemies in Ringed City as "Angels" (with quotes) in the Patch Notes
[3:21:01] <$Chimeraelite> Mine is almost chronological. Demons > DS1 > DS3 > DS2 but even at my personally most "hated" DS2 is STILL leagues above most games out there
[3:21:06] <%FrostMass22> Hot take: the ending of Dark Souls 2 is terrible and is the reason why the series grew more convoluted and unoriginal
[3:21:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he a hongry bio
[3:21:14] <%SergeEXE> HONGRY
[3:21:15] <+AXL808> I liked the spells in DS2 more than the ones in DS3 because there was more variety
[3:21:15] <cowunstoppable> never gonna happen but would you guys rather get bloosborne or demon's souls multiplatorm release?
[3:21:16] <Jontman42> I love them all equally
[3:21:17] <+LogothX> @Chimeraelite define "most".
[3:21:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> boi
[3:21:20] <+tussletoes> I rant a lot but I love/hate all Souls games almost equally lmao
[3:21:24] <+Buytoast> 3>1>Des>2
[3:21:25] <%badchoice5> How could anyone tell the difference between Angel wings and bird wings, in a land with human-sized birds?
[3:21:26] <@Mechz71> SAMOA JOE
[3:21:26] <$Chimeraelite> Least loved @LogothX lol
[3:21:27] <Darmarock> Like DS2 wasn't filled to DS1 references lmao
[3:21:28] <Josef_Stryker> DS3's magic is garbage
[3:21:30] <@Mechz71> HE'S FAT
[3:21:34] <@Mechz71> SENOR JOE
[3:21:35] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Yeyeye
[3:21:36] <+thebestestkevin> and ds3 isnt lmao
[3:21:42] <gorillahandz> hot take: video games are bad and we're all fools for playing them
[3:21:43] <%Faustgesicht> @SaltyDongs well done
[3:21:44] <%FrostMass22> DS2 was only DS1 references
[3:21:45] <tykai1> demon's souls 2 when?
[3:21:46] <$Chimeraelite> Also keep in mind I didn't play Scholar of the 1st SIn
[3:21:46] <candidateplays> The Angels is just stuff growing wings because they're turning into dragons.
[3:21:48] <%xemnahort> @cowunstoppable bloodborne I don’t like demons nearly as much
[3:21:56] <cizal11> scholar was even worse somehow
[3:22:01] <+sundizzle> dark souls 1 is all berserk references anyways, who are we kidding.
[3:22:01] <valdorick> DS3's copied magic from the other games is garbage, but fight me, The magic short sword spell was baller as fuck
[3:22:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> big rees
[3:22:26] <+RushUnplugged> ds3 magic is FINE, you just gotta actually put points in int
[3:22:27] <Josef_Stryker> And now for the more horrifying enemy in the game design wise
[3:22:31] <%mandragoraroot> jermaVenus
[3:22:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Dragmo screm
[3:22:39] <+thebestestkevin> ds3 has dope looking spells, but they are usually pretty impractical
[3:22:40] <SirDogBear> ds2 also had samurai knights
[3:22:54] <benjiFG> D:
[3:22:55] <Josef_Stryker> Ugh still creep me out
[3:22:59] <%AncelDeLambert> Hello Dragmo
[3:23:00] <cizal11> big unsettles
[3:23:01] <%axellogic> NOOO THE PEACEFUL ONE
[3:23:03] <%xemnahort> Farron flashsword is the best thing ds3 has ever done for magic
[3:23:03] <+Elexius> He was just chilling! Why?
[3:23:04] <%AncelDeLambert> NOOOOO
[3:23:04] <Inebriateddonut> He just stares at you he isn't even doing anything wtf
[3:23:05] <+tussletoes> “Dark souls is about a world’s collapse, civilizations falling and being forgotten.” Dark souls THREE: here’s gwyn lol
[3:23:06] <+Buytoast> murdering a baby
[3:23:06] <+redstonej> crack rocks
[3:23:08] <+AXL808> I feel like DS3 threw out all the DS2 spells and just went back to the DS1 spells
[3:23:09] <%AncelDeLambert> HE WAS FREND!
[3:23:10] <OwlLightningMage> I think Paige died BibleThump
[3:23:11] <+G_Thunders> I just like how DS2 got criticized for having a nonsensical world layout, then DS3 says “ the fire fading made random zones smash together” and that’s somehow fine.
[3:23:12] <+Ryallen> How many people have already made a Lucky Ted joke
[3:23:16] <+Bloodxb> he was innocent
[3:23:22] <stigna1> Ok, its been tite errybody, but I gotta rock and roll. Gnight everyone! ^_^
[3:23:22] <%bootysteve> Being chuffed makes me CHUFFED
[3:23:27] <Videogamer4> pat should go fight the dancer now tbh
[3:23:30] <dekkitout> what makes you not so chuffed
[3:23:34] <%Faustgesicht> collect rocks, crush children
[3:23:43] <%xemnahort> Pat murders the innocent live on stream
[3:23:44] <lloyddboy> ROIGHT CHUFFD
[3:23:47] <ceasefireiscool> i feel like that guy didn't need to be killed
[3:23:53] <+LogothX> They rapidly emit barf gas. Be careful
[3:24:03] <Cogito1001> CHUNGUS THYME
[3:24:05] <Josef_Stryker> Can Pat not upgrade his hammer?
[3:24:05] <cizal11> @G_Thunders because that's the opposite. ds2 tried to play it off like it made sense, ds3 made it make geographical sense even when it shouldn't
[3:24:06] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Dancer Kreygasm
[3:24:10] <Jontman42> Yeah kick it
[3:24:11] <valdorick> O-oh my, what happened pat, where's your BIG health bar?
[3:24:16] <+AXL808> still not sure what that gas is supposed to be
[3:24:16] <+AParkedChopper> half of ds2, when mapped out, is literally clipping through itself. That's why it gets so much flak
[3:24:16] <Josef_Stryker> Ugh I hate those things
[3:24:27] <valdorick> Did the Jailers decide to be TOTAL GARBAGE!?
[3:24:42] <lloyddboy> CRAZY TALK
[3:24:46] <%Keeble24> whats the lore here??? they experimented on fucked up babies or something???
[3:24:58] <%OdysseyKnight> Clutch
[3:24:59] <Videogamer4> BAITEX
[3:25:00] <candidateplays> That's not why it gets Flak. It gets flak because it has some transitions that break the illusion.
[3:25:00] <+RushUnplugged> they're dragon mixes iirc
[3:25:03] <+Bloodxb> they wanted to make dragons
[3:25:05] <+Elexius> They tried to make dragons, it didnt fucking work
[3:25:08] <Josef_Stryker> @Keeble24 They were trying to make Dragons out of people again
[3:25:12] <+Buytoast> babys are mutated dragon attempts or something
[3:25:14] <%AncelDeLambert> I can't believe Pat forgot that was the trap
[3:25:15] <oponomo2> hey pat. wanna Get invaded? i know where u live Kappa
[3:25:16] <Inebriateddonut> @Keeble24 Dragon prototypes or something
[3:25:18] <+RushUnplugged> and yes they're freak babies
[3:25:20] <%waddledoops> i never fully explored this place
[3:25:21] <+GTZergy> jailers are pretty easy if you have good spacing and a long weapon
[3:25:25] <TerraWraith> The lore is "I did a SCIENCE! but it didn't work." Fuck it
[3:25:26] <+LogothX> Berserk enemies
[3:25:27] <+timblenaut> PAIGE RUSTLING
[3:25:27] <Jontman42> That's about right
[3:25:28] <%AncelDeLambert> now go unlock that door
[3:25:30] <dekkitout> always with the dragon transformations
[3:25:31] <+AXL808> thematically speaking I think it's really interesting that the jailers are capable of reducing players' max health and not just inflict damage
[3:25:38] <%badchoice5> I mean, that's everything in this game
[3:25:41] <%waddledoops> i ran straight to the boss and killed it immediately and then never went back
[3:25:41] <+sundizzle> DS3 world design is just a bunch of bullshit got smashed together and somehow anor londo
[3:25:42] <%n33t_1337> DS3 is full of DS1 references wtf?
[3:25:43] <+petros_ichorus> science in dark souls is almost always bad
[3:25:49] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's that time of the month. time for science
[3:25:51] <Videogamer4> I wonder what ever happened to the emerald herald
[3:25:52] <%Keeble24> ahhhh ohhh the "turning people into dragons" plot... i see lol
[3:25:52] <%n33t_1337> they even call the places BY NAME
[3:25:52] <+LogothX> Those human faced things remind me of those f'd up creatures from Escape from Bug Island
[3:25:54] <+InkblotBlues> I did a science once. Wouldn't recommend it.
[3:25:57] <OwlLightningMage> These enemies are what happens when you eat McDonalds everyday SwiftRage
[3:25:58] <arfsm95> they did science with babys to try and create dragons, turns out, didn't work out
[3:26:01] <%n33t_1337> DS2 never did that
[3:26:02] <%axellogic> Next Dark Souls all enemies will have the Jailer's health removal as a passive
[3:26:03] <%badchoice5> Except Sif, he's just a good boi trying to make it in this messed up world
[3:26:03] <orihsnek> science is bad, don't learn anything you idiots
[3:26:05] <%BAGGETTA> failed prisoners aka free men. ©mattmcmuscles
[3:26:09] <+AParkedChopper> btw I bought a ps4, what are some must have games? (Other than Bloodborne, that's a given)
[3:26:11] <+Salvation122> This is, like, Mistakes Were Made: The Zone
[3:26:12] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Like Oceiros
[3:26:14] <+petros_ichorus> escape from dragon chimera island
[3:26:14] <+thebestestkevin> yeah except ds2 gets constant shit for it
[3:26:17] <Josef_Stryker> DS2's world design does leave alot ot be desired, but at least it did offer much more variety in how u go about the game, whereas DS3 is just two branching paths at a time.
[3:26:18] <+Tylermcd93> LUL Bug Island
[3:26:18] <+king_wragles> shit's locked
[3:26:19] <+ajcritfumble> its like fighting spectres in dnd ie: fucking scary and not fun unless youre the gm inwhich case its very fun
[3:26:20] <SirDogBear> people forgive ds3 more because more people like firekeeper in ds3 more than the emerald herald in ds2 CorgiDerp
[3:26:23] <dekkitout> turns out, playing god is HARD
[3:26:24] <%DedlokPM> SHIT'S LOCKED! z8z3
[3:26:25] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ew
[3:26:26] <%xemnahort> @badchoice5 sif deserved better
[3:26:31] <+LogothX> I always thought Dark Souls could use more Amazonian Lizard Women
[3:26:32] <+sundizzle> @AParkedChopper God of War is a must
[3:26:32] <cizal11> ds2 only has like 2 paths also
[3:26:34] <Videogamer4> scientists be like "I did what had to be done"
[3:26:35] <candidateplays> 'Turning people into dragons" is the entire plot of every Dark Souls game, and also Bloodborne, if you replace Dragons with old Ones.
[3:26:36] <Josef_Stryker> Emerald Herald is underrated
[3:26:37] <SchroedingersFerret> "I wonder if this will kill me?"
[3:26:46] <Nighthawkmun> Awwwwwwww pat
[3:26:47] <$rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat Has Paige ever had kombucha?
[3:26:47] <TerraWraith> @LogothX Now we're getting somewhere
[3:26:53] <+Buytoast> @AParkedChopper the only one i can think of that doesn't require prior involvement with previous entries is Spider-Man
[3:26:55] <+sundizzle> it's all about the dragons on the inside
[3:26:57] <+GTZergy> biggest problem with ds 2 are the bad bits are way way worse than the bad bits of ds 3
[3:26:59] <%n33t_1337> DS2 gave you like several different paths at least
[3:26:59] <Josef_Stryker> @cizal11 Technically yes but if u do things a certain way u can unlock areas earlier.
[3:27:02] <ceasefireiscool> kombucha is soo good
[3:27:05] <+Tylermcd93> @cizal11 No DS2 is like a tree where Majula is the trunk. It has 4 paths right off the bat.
[3:27:13] <%n33t_1337> DS3 was always a straight line and a fork on the rode
[3:27:16] <tysmiller> ds2 is way less linear than 3
[3:27:16] <benjiFG> "I wish there was somebody I could drop onto here"
[3:27:21] <%n33t_1337> road
[3:27:33] <+AParkedChopper> @Buytoast lucky, the thing came with Spiderman
[3:27:34] <cizal11> des is non linear. ds2 pretends to be nonlinear but couldn't be further from it
[3:27:37] <+redstonej> STOP
[3:27:38] <+sundizzle> the forks on the road for DS3 were pretty short lived though
[3:27:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Really? I basically have this level memorized
[3:27:48] <dekkitout> nb4 judo kick
[3:27:53] <+thebestestkevin> theres basically no forks honestly
[3:27:54] <+ajcritfumble> cmoooon tatsu
[3:27:56] <+Tylermcd93> DS1 is a web, DS2 is a tree with branches and roots, DS1 is a single line
[3:27:57] <%AncelDeLambert> REKT
[3:27:59] <valdorick> slurp
[3:28:00] <+ajcritfumble> awww
[3:28:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the real bosses
[3:28:02] <+AXL808> back spin kick!
[3:28:02] <%waddledoops> are there more mimics in this game than actual chests?
[3:28:02] <OwlLightningMage> Let it Die is goo Soulds
[3:28:05] <benjiFG> aaaaa EEEEE
[3:28:05] <+thebestestkevin> just which cinder lord do you want to fight first
[3:28:09] <Josef_Stryker> DS2, for example u could head to Heide's Tower kill the Rider, use the souls to buy the Cat Ring and head to the Gutter. Or u could use those souls to open up Earthen Peak.
[3:28:10] <+sundizzle> DS3 is WAY more linear than DS2
[3:28:10] <+Buytoast> 3 at least lets you fight end game bosses first if you want, 2 forces you to go through a parade on each street
[3:28:12] <+Tylermcd93> DS3 is a single line I mean
[3:28:15] <%xemnahort> Can you handle a rushdown character?
[3:28:16] <+thebestestkevin> yaoi blob or giant boi
[3:28:24] <%OdysseyKnight> DS3, where you finally find out the answer to the question "Can FromSoft overuse mimics?"
[3:28:24] <Josef_Stryker> And there's the usual way of just doing the Forest of Fallen Giants
[3:28:27] <Videogamer4> I hope sekiro is more like ds1 with branching paths now with the improved vertically
[3:28:28] <%OdysseyKnight> That answer being yes
[3:28:31] <Intolerable> Is Paige asleep on the couch or did she go to bed?
[3:28:32] <%n33t_1337> DS3 also has some garbage assm echanics
[3:28:36] <%n33t_1337> ass mechanics
[3:28:36] <DrDomVonDoom> What that tongue do tho
[3:28:40] <NiftyNox> Man Bloodborne 2 looks great
[3:28:44] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Remember when Woolie ate a tatsu from a Mimic
[3:28:50] <%xemnahort> Mimics are just rushdown characters with 2 really good 720s
[3:28:52] <TioXyco> Yes
[3:28:54] <Josef_Stryker> I think we can all agree that DS1 still has the best world design right?
[3:28:55] <+RushUnplugged> ladder
[3:28:56] <+Tylermcd93> DS2 will always be my favorite in the series

[3:29:15] <cizal11> feel bad for people who's favorite is ds2, born with no taste
[3:29:15] <SirDogBear> what i liked about ds3 is bleed is really fun in this game, ds2 poison was my jam though
[3:29:16] <+AParkedChopper> @Josef_Stryker I mean, duh
[3:29:18] <dekkitout> east i heard weast
[3:29:20] <@Mechz71> You know they say that all men are created equal, but you look at me and you look at the Pygmy and you can see that statement is not true. See, normally if you go one on one with another undead, you got a 50/50 chance of winning. But I'm the Ashen One and I'm not normal!
[3:29:20] <%DedlokPM> Go Nouth Weast
[3:29:24] <Josef_Stryker> @xemnahort We don't talk about that

[3:29:44] <%xemnahort> @cizal11 rather have no taste than be rude
[3:29:44] <+bobopipe> its a gigantic!
[3:29:45] <OwlLightningMage> DS 2 had the best build variety
[3:29:47] <ceasefireiscool> no idea but in silent hill you always go down and you like silent hill so go down
[3:29:48] <Josef_Stryker> DS2 made EVERYTHING Viable
[3:29:50] <+sundizzle> you have to fight his feetsies
[3:29:51] <TerraWraith> Guys, guys, You're all right. All the Souls games are bad, because they aren't Bloodborne.
[3:29:51] <+LogothX> DS2 fist weapons were the shit
[3:29:55] <LtThunderbolt> BULLY
[3:30:01] <%Divryne> You gotta lick the feet.
[3:30:01] <+Salvation122> Fucking drink
[3:30:02] <%Divryne> Pat.
[3:30:03] <Jontman42> Pat I think he has the advantage here
[3:30:05] <Josef_Stryker> I miss being able to just punch people with the Vanquisher's Seal
[3:30:05] <%AncelDeLambert> eat shit
[3:30:06] <%OdysseyKnight> just keep rollin' into those fists
[3:30:08] <Nighthawkmun> Arrows

[3:30:12] <valdorick> "everything was viable", except faith, fuck that shit right up the anus
[3:30:13] <+LogothX> Its just a shame DS2 is a crap factory; or I'd do a fist playthrough of the game
[3:30:14] <DraxTD> drink that sunny D pat
[3:30:17] <cizal11> everything viable but it plays awfully. vs ds3 where only some stuff is viable but it plays like a fucking dream

[3:30:29] <+Tylermcd93> DS2 is great
[3:30:30] <TerraWraith> What are hitboxes anyway?
[3:30:31] <SirDogBear> heck yea @Josef_Stryker i love poison builds but most souls games they are not very practical lol
[3:30:31] <%AncelDeLambert> pwnd

[3:31:13] <Josef_Stryker> @SirDogBear No kidding. In DS3, bleed was the way to go courtesy of Luck, shame that poison was about as effective as Pinwheel on a bad day.
[3:31:16] <TerraWraith> Aye!

[3:36:18] <Caidezes> And here's the only DS2 mimic in the entire game.
[3:36:22] <%Keeble24> it'd be interesting to have a game where it basically a prequel to dark souls, before shit went down
[3:36:23] <+king_wragles> both chests are safe

[3:36:59] <candidateplays> I like how they have both DS1 and DS2 mimics.
[3:37:00] <+Aleate> Don't worry about that
[3:37:06] <benswanny> "Yeah just dump them in here"
[3:37:06] <Inebriateddonut> SPILL OUT BROTHERS
[3:37:06] <Caidezes> @Gorgodrn Is there? I never noticed.
[3:37:08] <cizal11> spring loaded basilisks
[3:37:11] <%imextremelymanly> remember you dont have to fight them
[3:37:13] <benswanny> "that looks great. ship t."
[3:37:20] <Josef_Stryker> I remember the Basilisks scaring me when I first played DS1
[3:37:20] <%Faustgesicht> fucking clown car into the level
[3:37:28] <Josef_Stryker> Those "eyes" sure did the trick
[3:37:32] <@Mechz71> pat watch out there's an ambush here
[3:37:35] <%Keeble24> "Emerald splash?? more like, belongs in the trash"
[3:37:38] <%n33t_1337> I hate the flies more than the basilisks
[3:37:40] <%patriotrenegade> yes
[3:37:40] <misterspotswood> still am
[3:37:40] <%badchoice5> Not really
[3:37:43] <OwlLightningMage> YES
[3:37:46] <%n33t_1337> makes my skin crawl
[3:37:47] <Yummy_Nukes> nope
[3:37:47] <+Gorgodrn> @Caidezes Yes, in the room next to the lever that opens the gate from Dragon Barracks to Dragon Slayer Armour
[3:37:49] <+LogothX> Getting cursed was annoying
[3:37:49] <OwlLightningMage> THE FIRST TIME WAS BAD
[3:37:50] <$renyrells> not in this game
[3:37:51] <+Elexius> only in DS1
[3:37:51] <Nighthawkmun> Cursed stream
[3:37:51] <%imextremelymanly> they were awful in ds1
[3:37:52] <+RushUnplugged> I still am because ds1 curse SUUUUCKED BAALLLS
[3:37:53] <benjiFG> gives me conniptions
[3:37:54] <+king_wragles> Those things are creepy
[3:37:57] <+LogothX> An actual bio curse
[3:38:06] <sosuke5> Pokemon Let's Go to the polls
[3:38:06] <%DedlokPM> I am always surprised at how many people who stream this game seemingly not know or at least use the chain technique of identifying mimics
[3:38:08] <valdorick> The ones in DS3 seems to not aim their breath right... like...t hat one just leapt over your head 3 times and shot behind you.
[3:38:08] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat You never placed the Abyss Watcher ashes?
[3:38:09] <%Keeble24> LOL back when people thought the eyes where the big eye looking things
[3:38:14] <Josef_Stryker> Is it time for the room?
[3:38:16] <+GTZergy> them and the cursed spider monsters make my least favorite
[3:38:21] <Videogamer4> getting cursed pre patch MULTIPLE TIMES was a nightmare
[3:38:21] <cizal11> wonder if that might mean something like how almost everything from ds1 in this game is less than it should be hmmm
[3:38:22] <Caidezes> @Gorgodrn Huh. Guess I always killed it to fast to notice then.
[3:38:23] <ceasefireiscool> lord i need to go to bed. night everyone. night pat and paige
[3:38:23] <%xemnahort> I wasn’t scared until I learned what they do now I’m spooked forever
[3:38:29] <LtThunderbolt> ds3 but you can million stab
[3:38:30] <cizal11> the cinders they mean
[3:38:34] <OwlLightningMage> I don't think you need to
[3:38:36] <Josef_Stryker> @patriotrenegade Like it matters, u only need to do that the endgame
[3:38:38] <%OdysseyKnight> Kill them all Pat
[3:38:41] <TerraWraith> You never put the head on the throne
[3:38:42] <+Salvation122> THEY COMIN' FOR YA

[3:47:16] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat upgrade your weapon or set a password to bypass it
[3:47:21] <%TaifuDragon> It's a boss weapon so that should be equivalent to +4
[3:47:23] <OwlLightningMage> Gank town

[3:47:25] <%badchoice5> I just want to see whatever Pat's "squish" is
[3:47:26] <+Gorgodrn> +2 Twink/boss is the same as +4
[3:47:37] <OwlLightningMage> Go to gank town you coward SwiftRage

[3:53:50] <+Tylermcd93> I don't think Pat has ever found Sugandese
[3:53:53] <%xemnahort> Most people give up after eating the 720
[3:53:54] <%badchoice5> Why does Pat not show bobs on strem?
[3:53:59] <$serpenttucker> I like how the one or two times that pat sees me type in chat, it is when I say some sort of meme that would be embarassing out of context.
[3:54:02] <FoulNightingale> That can't be true

[3:56:48] <Bouldus> @dyhi30 yea most people do
[3:56:49] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat remember when peach practically failed for "feed grandma fat cock"

[3:57:20] <%badchoice5> Plague is a shitpost snob
[3:57:25] <indig0bird> I meant "(Pat wants to violently LOVE those nuts)"

[3:58:35] <OwlLightningMage> The Bill Nye GG joke is one the hardest I've ever laughed in my life and it's such a stupid joke
[3:58:37] <%hawk_rush> this place also sucks ass
[3:58:44] <Smithy4224> Everyone's talking about dumb kid jokes, and yet nobody here has a butfor.
[3:58:46] <Worldbrand> every game has giant butterflies if you're concussed enough
[3:58:47] <+AXL808> sigh yet another enemy magic was useless against

[3:59:21] <%VigorousSnow> verbal aboos
[3:59:26] <longrat> it infuriates me that there isn't a single souls game that feels 100% complete without half finished areas
[3:59:29] <%n33t_1337> So where's the Undead from DS2 in all of this
[3:59:29] <+FloorBurger> She's busy Pat!

[4:00:27] <DatAsuna> lies
[4:00:29] <DatAsuna> it's elmo
[4:00:37] <%MechaBaphomet> Finally someone said it
[4:00:37] <Bouldus> Pat is a Slaneeshi sex moster, with an extra Pat face on his ddick Kappa
[4:00:40] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Pat would totally wear a shirt of himself wearing a shirt of himself
[4:00:42] <@Mechz71> Pat is here to shitpost at
[4:00:45] <Josef_Stryker> @arcaderabbit48 DS3 pisses me off when it comes to lore references where the basically suck DS1's dick but put in the most nothing shit from DS2
[4:00:47] <%d00msdaydan> i don't tune in for either one of you in particular, it is only when both of you are on stream flinging shit at each other that i am content
[4:00:50] <%badchoice5> Time for McDonalds!

[4:01:02] <valdorick> No, make a stand Pat! Order Burger King!
[4:01:02] <+king_wragles> SURRENDER TO THE AMERICAN COPORATIONS
[4:01:02] <%crimsonharvest> you liar buttons is the only thing you truly love
[4:01:04] <+Nobrev> it is a scientific fact that pat's streams increase tenfold in quality when paige is present
[4:01:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> poop
[4:01:05] <+thebestestkevin> pat how are you gonna order food at 2am

[4:01:13] <+Gravity_Gunner> Pat is the Marty Jannety
[4:01:13] <%imextremelymanly> why don't you guys ever have food at your home
[4:01:15] <+AXL808> Paige needs VVcDonalds now!
[4:01:15] <arcaderabbit48> @Josef_Stryker And the game suffers so hard for it. In ignoring DS2 so hard, they turn around and make a lot of the same mistakes that game did.
[4:01:19] <limeyprick> just freeze the red bull
[4:01:21] <%bevyrage> didn't tweet the gif with both of your faces on it yet. was it not low enough effort? (jk)
[4:01:23] <%Afancymoose> Pat is dating a shitpost
[4:01:25] <OwlLightningMage> You guys eat food at the most fucked up times
[4:01:29] <+NWR_James> order a mcdonald, just the one
[4:01:32] <Pajex_> PogChamp
[4:01:33] <%forevern2dust> cool
[4:01:34] <admiralsatan> shorten or make better
[4:01:35] <%xemnahort> @clolei it’s only 11 here
[4:01:36] <+AXL808> even more so than the lupus actually
[4:01:38] <%Spydurman> Paige can have McD's but Pat can't have cake
[4:01:39] <%FrostMass22> Not the lupus?
[4:01:40] <+FloorBurger> That and the lupus
[4:01:41] <+JenovasPuppet> I don't know, Paige has a lot of life shortening things like witch curses
[4:01:41] <+Tylermcd93> Thats so mean BibleThump
[4:01:42] <DRAGKUDO> Paige laughs in the face of death
[4:01:43] <Bouldus> and THIS ladies and gentleman is where it went downhill Kappa
[4:01:43] <zettig> Why do you guys always order food? Do you not keep food in the house? I'm not being mean, I'm just curious.
[4:01:44] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> live slow dies whenever
[4:01:45] <%badchoice5> I used to assume Paige would outlive Pat, now its a toss up
[4:01:51] <%Faustgesicht> could've been 105, but too bad she had a phone
[4:01:52] <%Spydurman> LUL
[4:01:55] <+NWR_James> @badchoice5 whoever kills the other wins

[4:02:00] <+Gorgodrn> The way to the key and Onionbro is inside
[4:02:01] <fingalights> Mcd's is filled with Lupus worms
[4:02:01] <DublinRage> Idk Pat, you sure like to push Paige's buttons. Not innuendo, I swear.
[4:02:02] <@Mechz71> What's wrong Pat-kun do you not want my Mcnuggies? @AngriestPat
[4:02:03] <%OdysseyKnight> Stop
[4:02:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Not at all
[4:02:06] <%forevern2dust> the closer she is to death the closer she is to being a skeleton
[4:02:07] <DatAsuna> Paige isn't fat, so
[4:02:07] <valdorick> H-his Benis?
[4:02:08] <%mandragoraroot> the big benus

[4:02:13] <DavidSanChan> beatus the meatus
[4:02:13] <+AXL808> that's fine, he'll just eat it in the closet
[4:02:14] <OwlLightningMage> The Red Bull is killing Pat faster than all the cake in the world
[4:02:15] <+democrazyyy> what
[4:02:20] <Yummy_Nukes> big beedus
[4:02:20] <hntronium> Paige are you high
[4:02:21] <juxtest> What IF the big fetus indeed
[4:02:24] <+king_wragles> Isn't it the damndest thing that the one who orders McDonald like 5 times a week is the one to NOT get gout?
[4:02:25] <+JenovasPuppet> Pat show betis
[4:02:25] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Lord Beetus
[4:02:27] <$nademonkey1100> wilfered is dead
[4:02:29] <+NWR_James> Benus or Pepis
[4:02:32] <+Gravity_Gunner> Is Paige drunk?
[4:02:33] <%Faustgesicht> everyone died
[4:02:33] <%badchoice5> Paige has no fear of the Diabeastie
[4:02:34] <$nademonkey1100> betus guy died

[4:02:39] <+AXL808> mimic burger
[4:02:42] <@Mechz71> Pat get my chicken tendies
[4:02:43] <%hawk_rush> paige would die instantly
[4:02:46] <FracturedImage> he's 84
[4:02:49] <TerraWraith> That McDonald's has no honor
[4:02:51] <KaseKaizer> D:

[4:02:57] <+Rorinator> Nope
[4:02:57] <@Mechz71> get me chicken tendies Pat
[4:02:57] <Bouldus> wilfred brimly was immortalised in WOW with a big dumb owl mount
[4:02:57] <ProRJHunter> Alive
[4:02:58] <+king_wragles> spell his name?
[4:02:58] <heatrashes> living
[4:02:59] <admiralsatan> wilfred brimley is becoming stronger
[4:02:59] <+trnzero> he lives
[4:02:59] <+JenovasPuppet> Patrick Steward got him in a murder/suicide
[4:02:59] <+Tylermcd93> FeelsBadMan
[4:03:00] <%badchoice5> Alexa says he lives
[4:03:01] <%imextremelymanly> really
[4:03:02] <gorillahandz> not dead
[4:03:02] <%mandragoraroot> hes in dead or alive
[4:03:06] <+Rorinator> He's 84
[4:03:06] <valdorick> That's why Burger King would be the ruler of the Thing world - They're flame Broiled for your order, and thus would burn the Thing
[4:03:06] <+AXL808> he died the moment before you said that
[4:03:06] <KaseKaizer> FeelsAmazingMan
[4:03:07] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> D:
[4:03:08] <misterspotswood> hes good
[4:03:08] <%Faustgesicht> LIVING
[4:03:08] <Josef_Stryker> @arcaderabbit48 I actually like the way DS2 handled DS1 references for the most part. Instead of outright saying it what characters did, we learn of their legacy such as the Fenito and Milfanito who were created to carry Nito's legacy of comforting the dead or the Lost Sinner who is a reincarnation of the Witches.
[4:03:10] <Yummy_Nukes> what if Paige is the thing???
[4:03:11] <%Spydurman> imagine if The Thing could be inanimate objects
[4:03:12] <+Tylermcd93> D:
[4:03:13] <OwlLightningMage> Owl mounts are cool
[4:03:15] <+Yeajow> Undead for sure
[4:03:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> he just liked one of my twitter posts to him, and we talked about it while we recorded the thing commentary
[4:03:18] <EMP_Ike_Turner> He just stopped aging
[4:03:18] <+democrazyyy> Schrodinger's diabeetus
[4:03:19] <$MightyMaxT> Alien Space Ship is a McDonalds burger. The Aliens are worm-like
[4:03:21] <@PlagueOfGripes> how can you question this
[4:03:22] <xeros720> he's just in Dead
[4:03:23] <+TheGodfrey> The Thing is more palatable than a Big Mac
[4:03:23] <+JenovasPuppet> He IS in Death Stranding though
[4:03:24] <%forevern2dust> still going strong at 84 years
[4:03:25] <%craig_t> JK Rowlinged?
[4:03:26] <+king_wragles> Owl mounts ARE cool, what brought them up?
[4:03:27] <+NWR_James> Wilfred for SC6
[4:03:28] <%FrostMass22> Blood test
[4:03:32] <%craig_t> what on earth does that mean
[4:03:37] <Mr_Strut> Paige confirmed for DOAX5
[4:03:38] <$Piemono> but he can be in SC VI
[4:03:39] <@Mechz71> You certainly are something Paige
[4:03:39] <cizal11> @Josef_Stryker problem is all of that feels fanfictiony as fuck

[4:04:01] <%Faustgesicht> YEAH MALUS MALEFICARUM dat shit
[4:04:01] <%SaltyDongs> it is super fast
[4:04:02] <%AlfredoChicken> ask which is the good boob
[4:04:04] <+JenovasPuppet> It's FAR more logical!
[4:04:06] <Jontman42> Efficiency trumps logic
[4:04:08] <+NWR_James> speed is a form of logic
[4:04:09] <+AXL808> if Paige didn't die then Pat would try to steal her secrets of immortality
[4:04:10] <OwlLightningMage> Witch logic is the fastest.
[4:04:11] <xeros720> go get Elmo to shoot you guys
[4:04:11] <valdorick> Logic requires thinking, and thinking requires time - best to just burn it all and let ash sort it out.
[4:04:12] <+FloorBurger> Honk the marriage tiddie.
[4:04:14] <%badchoice5> Could The Thing have Lupus?
[4:04:16] <Cthulos> Burn the witch!
[4:04:17] <arcaderabbit48> @Josef_Stryker Pretty much! People complain DS2 depended too much on DS, but then turn around a praise DS3 for sucking DS' dick. Its super hypocritical, especially for a problem that DS2 didn't even have. It did a fine job with the DS lore and building off of it
[4:04:31] <Zuzecha> the marriage titty is the side you lay on you derp

[4:04:47] <Josef_Stryker> @cizal11 I mean part of me gets that but the other part of me would probably have hated if they did the same thing with DS3 because I'd eventually complain that it was just sucking DS1's dick instead of trying it's own thing.
[4:04:47] <%SergeEXE> GUN
[4:04:47] <OwlLightningMage> Pat might just shoot you anyway

[4:04:56] <cizal11> @arcaderabbit48 ds2 is barely a step above ds1 fanfiction. ds3 is just a sequel
[4:05:01] <TerraWraith> SHoot them both
[4:05:02] <+Salvation122> It's worth noting that shooting The Thing didn't really do much to it
[4:05:06] <+JenovasPuppet> OR MORE
[4:05:10] <xBolts4Lifex> LUL
[4:05:11] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Paige is all fatal areas
[4:05:12] <+NWR_James> Perfect copy of Paige will probably just die on its own if yo u let it. Just leave poison and glass out
[4:05:14] <valdorick> The twist here is - Pat is the Thing
[4:05:16] <%OdysseyKnight> Waow
[4:05:16] <+king_wragles> He's not wrong
[4:05:16] <@PlagueOfGripes> blood test her woman blood
[4:05:17] <%Spydurman> What if you're The Thing
[4:05:17] <misterspotswood> the thing ((prequel)) said look for tooth fillings
[4:05:19] <Jontman42> But Pat will be safe
[4:05:19] <%badchoice5> What about you?
[4:05:19] <%Faustgesicht> but what if you thing
[4:05:19] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ...
[4:05:20] <+claudesavegely> Pat was the thing all along
[4:05:21] <@Mechz71> AND PAT WAS THE THING ALL ALONG
[4:05:22] <Bouldus> and then it turns out Pat was the thing
[4:05:22] <Moonlight_Grimoire> He's not wrong
[4:05:22] <+CaptainJax> but what if YOU'RE the thing
[4:05:23] <ziggbuttz> pat u selfish coont
[4:05:23] <+WhyIDie> skip the fire test, just go straight to the murder
[4:05:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> lol
[4:05:24] <xBolts4Lifex> its the only way pat
[4:05:24] <+JenovasPuppet> Do you shoot yourself in case you might be The Thing and you didn't know?

[4:05:35] <longrat> god this area sucks
[4:05:36] <+AXL808> if she floats she's a witch
[4:05:37] <%thewinged7> so pat is the guy that goes crazy and gets shot first?
[4:05:37] <%Svanyr> But what if YOU are the thing
[4:05:40] <Djinnazz> @AngriestPat Why not just shoot the leg or something?
[4:05:40] <admiralsatan> just shoot everyone, that way you're safe for sure
[4:05:41] <Moonlight_Grimoire> also a bulletshot isn't going to put down the thing and just leaves more organic matter for it to play with
[4:05:42] <+Gorgodrn> elaK
[4:05:46] <Josef_Stryker> Did Pat ever upgrade his hammer yet?
[4:05:47] <OwlLightningMage> Women don't have blood. They have period.
[4:05:49] <+FloorBurger> Use GUN to make sure.
[4:05:49] <Zuzecha> yes
[4:05:49] <+thebestestkevin> profaned capital is so disappointing
[4:05:53] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat what if pat was the thing?
[4:05:53] <KaseKaizer> WutFace
[4:05:55] <Zuzecha> that would be hell
[4:06:00] <%badchoice5> Doesn't that happen anyways?
[4:06:00] <Bouldus> Paige how quickly do women synch on that
[4:06:02] <%DedlokPM> GOOD JOB, MACE
[4:06:03] <Zuzecha> ragtime is a musical genre
[4:06:04] <arcaderabbit48> @cizal11 See, I can't agree with that though. DS2 at least has areas unique to it that don't depend on DS1. DS3 is cramming DS1 stuff in everywhere it possibly can. "Remember THIS thing?? Well its dead now!"
[4:06:07] <Coystick> !uptime
[4:06:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 6m 8s.
[4:06:08] <+thebestestkevin> the "capital" is just like 2 buildings?
[4:06:10] <+trnzero> i'm imagining an interrogation room w/ glass set out in front. The real paige couldn't resist eating the glass and would be sweating bullets
[4:06:11] <Bouldus> i didnt think it would be immediately
[4:06:11] <+AXL808> Pat is already the thing
[4:06:12] <ziggbuttz> women are the key to survival against the thing, you heard it here
[4:06:15] <+TheGodfrey> you mean he isnt?
[4:06:15] <Jontman42> Isn't that like a myth
[4:06:17] <@PlagueOfGripes> what if the thing became el pregante
[4:06:17] <OwlLightningMage> See if it says anything wrong
[4:06:18] <+JenovasPuppet> If The Thing is a perfect copy, would it mimicking everyone on earth really change things much?
[4:06:21] <%AParkedChopper> TIL cosplayer streams are boring as hell
[4:06:24] <ArtThouBored> They'd all kill each other
[4:06:24] <Pajex_> would the Thing react if you put blanks in the gun? 🤔
[4:06:27] <Nepsotic> you gotta upgrade it more dammit
[4:06:27] <Th1sisstan> he is the small thing
[4:06:28] <DavidSanChan> is pat synced with you
[4:06:29] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Almost glomped
[4:06:29] <fingalights> Blood magic
[4:06:30] <%forevern2dust> She is born of the blood. Made man by the blood. Undone by the blood.
[4:06:32] <zamzoph> wat
[4:06:33] <%DedlokPM> "It Depends" I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE apatWhat
[4:06:35] <thehollow89> It's sync or swim
[4:06:36] <%OdysseyKnight> Sync your periods to unlock synchronized pregnancy
[4:06:36] <+WhyIDie> just download the app, add them to your friend list, and hit the "sync" button
[4:06:36] <+InkblotBlues> What if Elmo is the Thing?
[4:06:37] <+cvp5127> ??
[4:06:39] <%MechaBaphomet> Sounds like something the thing would do
[4:06:40] <Bouldus> OH i know its a thing, i was jsut curious how quickly or slowly it would happen
[4:06:41] <+AXL808> You have to hold the button until their eyes flash collectively
[4:06:41] <Yummy_Nukes> BUT DO YOU HAVE NON-CONTAMINATED BLOOD TO TEST WITH???
[4:06:42] <Kaitepaints> That’s not real
[4:06:43] <TerraWraith> What if Pat was the thing. Like, no copy of him, he just was the thing and didn't know it.
[4:06:45] <+Noxybaru> Laugh it up
[4:06:45] <%badchoice5> It depends, are their body clocks on metric or imperial time?
[4:06:46] <%imextremelymanly> shark week
[4:06:48] <KaseKaizer> like at one level of Social-link do the menstrual cycles sync?
[4:06:49] <$Piemono> Hooters must've been a nightmare
[4:06:49] <ziggbuttz> within two months of occupying the same environment, females will begin to sync up their cycles. Men also sync up their cycles, they just don't bleed.
[4:06:49] <lloyddboy> If Paige were The Thing then it would be under attack from lupus and you'd know instantly
[4:06:51] <Bouldus> but if it varies then it varies :P
[4:06:52] <%mandragoraroot> apatBig
[4:06:53] <+blupsy> big gross syncing
[4:06:54] <@Mechz71> Elmo is the man of the house
[4:06:59] <Coystick> Remember Profaned Capital was supposed to be Wolnir's domain back when the Abyss Watchers were supposed to be fighting Carthus
[4:07:00] <Liwyn> pat would volunteer to be the thing tbh
[4:07:01] <$MightyMaxT> The Porkening is synced
[4:07:03] <%Faustgesicht> if elmo is thing, life's not worth it
[4:07:06] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat's butt ovulations are regular and concerning
[4:07:06] <+AHolyCorndog> Somebody call Britney Spears, cause this is TOXIC
[4:07:09] <admiralsatan> burn them all pat
[4:07:10] <+JenovasPuppet> That's smarter
[4:07:10] <valdorick> Jesus pat, why would you EVER skip flame thrower!?
[4:07:10] <+Tylermcd93> LUL
[4:07:14] <Moonlight_Grimoire> always straight to flame thrower
[4:07:18] <+JenovasPuppet> Burn them all and then yourself
[4:07:19] <Bouldus> god damn it Plague ahaha
[4:07:20] <%MostFrank> Burn them all
[4:07:23] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat but what if apatWink is the thing
[4:07:25] <%badchoice5> Then Pat would be safe, so we are fine
[4:07:28] <%forevern2dust> At what point in this scenario do you become a toilet?
[4:07:28] <Inebriateddonut> Shoot self with fire
[4:07:30] <+bobopipe> damn paige
[4:07:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> emlo
[4:07:31] <+Tylermcd93> Emlo
[4:07:32] <valdorick> Elmo would just eat the Thing
[4:07:33] <+NWR_James> Emlo is the thing
[4:07:33] <cizal11> @arcaderabbit48 almost all the stuff in ds1 is purposefully like desiccated and lesser than it used to be, that's the whole meta point of it. the whole game is a metacommentary on the series, no troll.
[4:07:34] <%mandragoraroot> emlo
[4:07:38] <admiralsatan> you cant burn a toilet
[4:07:38] <+JenovasPuppet> Do not joke about Emlo being the thing....
[4:07:38] <DavidSanChan> if elmo's head splits, you have two elmo heads to pet
[4:07:39] <+AXL808> good ol' Emlo
[4:07:39] <lloyddboy> Assimilate into Elmo
[4:07:40] <Dragonfang1337> guess I'll die
[4:07:40] <Zuzecha> does this mean PAT and PAIGE have been COOP Bloodbourne because they SYNC on RAGTIME
[4:07:42] <+FloorBurger> sipsipHellmo sipsipHellmo
[4:07:42] <Jontman42> He would love him all the same
[4:07:45] <%mandragoraroot> emlo is a thing
[4:07:49] <+RushUnplugged> "if anything happened to Elmo I would kill everyone in this room, and then myself" to paraphrase
[4:07:49] <Bouldus> Elmo become as god
[4:07:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> thicc
[4:07:52] <%badchoice5> Laugh as Elmo the Thing struggle to manage his legs
[4:07:53] <misterspotswood> you cut the pinky to the first bend and if it becomes its own thing then boom its a thing
[4:07:53] <xeros720> be one with the baby
[4:07:54] <%Faustgesicht> apatWink apatWink apatWink
[4:07:55] <DatAsuna> pat loves elmo more confirmed
[4:07:55] <+king_wragles> So
[4:07:56] <Coystick> Elmo Vs Emlo Whoever Wins We Lose
[4:07:57] <Jontman42> Oh no these weirdos
[4:07:58] <%OdysseyKnight> The giant fap hands
[4:07:58] <OwlLightningMage> Emlo the Unborkable
[4:08:00] <+JenovasPuppet> @FloorBurger No! We do not burn the baby!
[4:08:00] <+AXL808> god, the literal shit babies
[4:08:00] <@Mechz71> time everyone to make Elmo thing photoshops
[4:08:00] <%thewinged7> become as god
[4:08:00] <+king_wragles> these guys are the worst
[4:08:01] <%waddledoops> oh god i hate these things
[4:08:02] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat I think I have the answer on the invasions. Given that I just invaded "Zach the Destroyer" and was followed by another invasion from "Pat Hunter" it seems we're all fucking invading each other.
[4:08:04] <longrat> man these hand guys are cool
[4:08:04] <Talz_> Thingmo is too big and strong, no chance at winning
[4:08:07] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Biggest gross
[4:08:09] <longrat> so fucking weird
[4:08:09] <TerraWraith> I fogot about these freaks
[4:08:09] <ArtThouBored> Stick Pat with a needle if you think he is the thing
[4:08:09] <+Gorgodrn> Holy, they are super weak t frost
[4:08:10] <%mandragoraroot> ✋
[4:08:11] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat when do you think Blair became The Thing? I always thought it happened in the shack and the real Blair tried to hang himself
[4:08:11] <Pajex_> what are these hand babys
[4:08:12] <+BestTeaMaker> i forgot about these guys
[4:08:13] <benjiFG> bleed is effective against these guys
[4:08:13] <SirDogBear> pat views elmo > humans
[4:08:18] <+king_wragles> I hate EVERYTHING about these enemies
[4:08:18] <heatrashes> these monsters r yucky
[4:08:19] <%FrostMass22> "Come here, Thingmo"
[4:08:21] <Bouldus> these dude are so weird
[4:08:22] <%badchoice5> Elmo can't deal with 4 legs half the time, what would he do with a transforming body?
[4:08:23] <Coystick> These or the centipedes are the worst things ever

[4:08:54] <Djinnazz> AN attemted was made.
[4:08:57] <+Gravity_Gunner> Could be worse, could be human centipedes
[4:09:00] <Yummy_Nukes> I'll flamethrower the both of you out of love
[4:09:00] <valdorick> You're all going weak here guys - just burn it all. If you're in charge of something, and get a message "There might a John Carpenter's The Thing on the compound", you just burn the entire place down first, ask questions later.
[4:09:00] <Bouldus> now PAT is the hooker on the corner
[4:09:02] <+JenovasPuppet> Your belief that you could live is what killed you
[4:09:02] <Jontman42> Or highseven or how many that was
[4:09:04] <%mandragoraroot> ✋ ✋
[4:09:06] <OwlLightningMage> Just bring Elmo to a toilet.
[4:09:09] <arfsm95> the worst part about this monsters is not that they are gross hand monsters, is that they're gross hairy hand monsters @AngriestPat
[4:09:14] <%Faustgesicht> give you some touchies on your everywhere
[4:09:15] <%badchoice5> Those may not be the toughest, but they SUCK to fight
[4:09:19] <+NWR_James> FBBlock
[4:09:20] <ArtThouBored> Speaking of Thing, hand monsters
[4:09:22] <+cvp5127> vore?
[4:09:22] <Josef_Stryker> Unless u got bleed, then they're just cows to the slaughter
[4:09:23] <MrMagicConch> Why'd you hit the sleeping one ya big hckin silly
[4:09:24] <%Spydurman> Pat will shoot Paige but not Elmo
[4:09:25] <admiralsatan> what if elmo was a toilet
[4:09:33] <Coystick> it's literal rubbish
[4:09:33] <Objurgo> Dying to the thing would kinda suck cause you wouldn't even realize that you've died on the molecular level

[4:09:36] <Migada> just offer elmo some loops, brother
[4:09:36] <+RushUnplugged> you go up instead of down at the poison
[4:09:37] <+NWR_James> FBBlock sipsipBaby
[4:09:38] <OwlLightningMage> What if the Thing was a toilet?
[4:09:40] <+thebestestkevin> big romantic rubber fist got anthropomorphized
[4:09:41] <Josef_Stryker> On another note, I'mma go to bed. G'Night Shitlords :) /
[4:09:42] <%badchoice5> Yeah
[4:09:45] <+JenovasPuppet> Obviously
[4:09:48] <arcaderabbit48> @cizal11 That's true, but I feel DS3 could have done it better. Remember the zombie dragons from DS1 and how they were originally much more grotesque, but Miyazaki wanted them to have a more noble design? He wanted them to retain some measure of dignity, even so long after their prime. I don't feel that in DS3. We go to an area that's literally wall to wall demon corpses. No dignity for the thing we are harkening back to, just shock value. It feels cheap by comparison. I'd feel better about all
[4:09:49] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What if Elmo was The Thing from the Fantastic Four?
[4:09:50] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> i waifu the thing
[4:09:51] <Bouldus> @badchoice5 i swear the worst enemies in souls games are always the weird annoying ones, not the "hard" ones
[4:09:53] <@Mechz71> oh you mean the enemies that have no bad frames on miss and there are multiple of them
[4:09:54] <Yummy_Nukes> LUL
[4:09:56] <%badchoice5> If a gunshot kills Paige, she wasnt worthy
[4:10:01] <OwlLightningMage> Paige would be an Enhancer. She could take a bullet.
[4:10:01] <+AXL808> she's accepted her place
[4:10:04] <admiralsatan> what if toilets were mimics
[4:10:09] <%imextremelymanly> shoot me fatal
[4:10:11] <+WhyIDie> the thing paige would know this now, and hold elmo in front of her
[4:10:13] <+ForteBlade> someone who says Illinois is southern is not tough
[4:10:14] <+CaptainJax> it's faster if you go fatal
[4:10:17] <Coystick> Shoot me daddyy
[4:10:24] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ohh noo that sucks
[4:10:28] <limeyprick> next level kinks
[4:10:28] <%Faustgesicht> i blam blam because i love
[4:10:29] <arfsm95> i mean, paige wasn't even subbed to pat until like, 3 months ago
[4:10:32] <%Spydurman> I kinda wish they'd made Prey into a space The Thing movie
[4:10:33] <%badchoice5> Aim for the head, no taking chances
[4:10:36] <+JenovasPuppet> I'm totally using "I thought they were The Thing!" if I ever get brought up on murder charges
[4:10:36] <Bouldus> she was coming right for me Kappa
[4:10:40] <+king_wragles> only a monster can squirt mustard into their gullet for 6 seconds straight
[4:10:40] <arfsm95> emlo would sub to pat
[4:10:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat, you don't wanna hurt nobody
[4:10:43] <admiralsatan> thicc
[4:10:48] <Jontman42> Oh they have a tail
[4:10:49] <Traxad> @arcaderabbit48 True, a lot of Bloodborne design bled into DS3.

[4:10:52] <Coystick> Are these things Manus's autistic children?
[4:10:53] <+Rorinator> Man I should rewatch the thing
[4:10:54] <SirDogBear> what if pat had to choose between shooting matt or woolie first?
[4:10:56] <+AXL808> it has a tail...
[4:10:56] <%Spydurman> eyes on the inside
[4:10:57] <admiralsatan> damn

[4:11:09] <Jontman42> The proportions are right actually
[4:11:10] <Coystick> Monstrosity of Chonk
[4:11:11] <OwlLightningMage> What if Fuggins was the Thing?
[4:11:12] <SainVt> they are ijdiel's babies
[4:11:13] <%xemnahort> @plagueofgripes that means he wants to hurt everybody
[4:11:17] <MrMagicConch> Pat cannot roll out of his bed coccoon
[4:11:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> just a big groping hand, grasping for any honkable object
[4:11:20] <%Faustgesicht> the poop hair is a nice touch
[4:11:20] <%FrostMass22> This is a Bloodborne monster
[4:11:21] <%AParkedChopper> What if Pat's head opened up like a gross maw for like a second then he just went back to streaming
[4:11:24] <OwlLightningMage> Could Pat shoot Fuggins?
[4:11:24] <Inebriateddonut> I can't remember how I visceral attacked these guys

[4:11:31] <heatrashes> squish
[4:11:31] <arcaderabbit48> @Traxad As someone who loves Bloodborne and coonsiders it my favorite of the Blood Souls series, BB leaking in to DS3 was the worst thing that could have happened to DS
[4:11:35] <+Gravity_Gunner> @rorinator Yes, you should. But not the Pre-Reboot-Sequel
[4:11:43] <Yummy_Nukes> squish the tush
[4:11:47] <+LogothX> A giant hand enemy seems appropriate.
[4:11:54] <Bouldus> lol
[4:11:58] <%DedlokPM> mogsHiccup
[4:11:58] <candidateplays> I really can't understand people saying that's a Bloodborne monster. That's 100% a Dark Souls design
[4:12:01] <%xemnahort> Y’know I wanted to defend ds3 but then I remembered these hand things and I gave up
[4:12:03] <Sir_Naix> was that squeak or a hiccup
[4:12:04] <%mandragoraroot> hic
[4:12:06] <Bouldus> finally learnt how to get RUBBISH
[4:12:08] <%badchoice5> WE DEMAND BUTT HONKING ON STREM
[4:12:08] <OwlLightningMage> Paige just honked
[4:12:09] <thehollow89> Remember when it was Two Best Friends and Matt was the honkable object?
[4:12:12] <%TaifuDragon> Another for the list: Patron Hoonter
[4:12:13] <Laecerelius> Those creatures are basically the gross hentai NTR man of monsters
[4:12:13] <%imextremelymanly> gotta free the man
[4:12:15] <Traxad> @arcaderabbit48 Agreed. I dont mind it too much but it feels a tad bit lazy. Understandable but lazy.
[4:12:19] <%DedlokPM> Paige tonight = mogsHiccup
[4:12:20] <Coystick> Whoever though of molar teeth on the palm of a hand as a visual motif needs a raise
[4:12:20] <%TaifuDragon> Who, as with the rest, immediately quits on invasion
[4:12:23] <Bouldus> waah?
[4:12:24] <Bouldus> lol
[4:12:26] <TerraWraith> @arcaderabbit48 agreed. DS is to D&D as BB is to CoC
[4:12:26] <arcaderabbit48> Its literally a hipp ogre form the neck down, so yest the hand things are a DS design
[4:12:30] <+thebestestkevin> @arcaderabbit48 ^^^^ ds3 feels like miyazaki just wanted to make bloodborne again
[4:12:30] <+G_Thunders> @candidateplays The hand made of eyes on the inside?

[4:12:36] <%Spydurman> @AngriestPat my cat is sleeping with her tongue sticking out and it's adorable
[4:12:39] <+king_wragles> is that why Paige is off screen? So she can seig heil?
[4:12:39] <candidateplays> The whole Hand /Face/Teeth thing is from Manus
[4:12:41] <Bouldus> @TerraWraith thats pretty accurate
[4:12:41] <%imextremelymanly> yes
[4:12:42] <+Gorgodrn> And the hand is literally Manus'
[4:12:42] <Djinnazz> yes.
[4:12:43] <cizal11> @arcaderabbit48 dark souls 1 is supposed to be this mythic sort of legend thing and so everything in it reflects that. ds3 spends a lot of its time intentionally taking the sort of purposeful nostalgia the first game built and using it go pretty much to complete other direction. ds3 doesn't feel very mythical or legendary at all, and that's definitely on purpose. it's about dispelling myths and legends more than anything.

[4:14:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> bitches, man
[4:14:16] <+Nautilus_Bot> Aren’t these guys like the ogres from DS2?
[4:14:17] <%waddledoops> i love the name of the profaned capitol
[4:14:18] <OwlLightningMage> She made the flame that's stupid and makes no sense
[4:14:26] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat in the hands look like suction cups
[4:14:28] <%badchoice5> WAIT, NOW THERE ARE TWO OF THEM!
[4:14:36] <Bouldus> theres usually like 3
[4:14:43] <longrat> @AngriestPat if you notice their face hand has some weird growth shit that looks a lot like manus's hand
[4:14:48] <+Nobrev> I hate the bloodborne hand babies so much
[4:14:50] <arcaderabbit48> @cizal11 I agree, but that's why I don't like it. DS3 lacks a lot of the dignity DS had and I don't like that. It loses something in that transition, and DS3 feels much less alive and meaningful in that sense. That's probably more a personal thing, but I really can't stand it and I don't think it was done particularly well.
[4:14:50] <Coystick> Pat you don't understand frostbite
[4:14:54] <%mandragoraroot> NotLikeThis
[4:14:55] <candidateplays> They're explained. They're relatives of that guy on the roof and got transformed for eating people.

[4:15:11] <artoflec> thanks Miyazaki
[4:15:11] <heatrashes> o no
[4:15:11] <%badchoice5> Blunt weapons are often strong against large fleshy creatures

[4:15:50] <Nighthawkmun> Yeet on my feet
[4:15:51] <OneShotZombie> funny thing is I think you could have won if you attacked while you were trapped
[4:15:52] <Bouldus> Pat wtf was that?
[4:15:53] <Xystant> SCOOP DIDDY WOOP
[4:15:54] <Bouldus> ahahah
[4:15:55] <+cTAKU> wait what was that
[4:15:58] <+democrazyyy> lmao
[4:16:02] <$WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> Did your burp fuck a hiccup and just spawn that noise?
[4:16:02] <heatrashes> the siblings go hic
[4:16:03] <Hyper_charger> what just happened?
[4:16:04] <zamzoph> You never thought that before?
[4:16:06] <Bouldus> cuuute
[4:16:07] <+RushUnplugged> Manus does mean hand in latin...
[4:16:08] <TerraWraith> Manus' hand was a hand, not a face tho
[4:16:09] <%mandragoraroot> thanus
[4:16:10] <%badchoice5> They're dark creatures, it all comes back to Manus in the end
[4:16:14] <artoflec> there is lore from an armor set that explains who they were in the capital
[4:16:16] <+king_wragles> I don't want them to be related to anything, so that there isn't anymore of these horrible awful things
[4:16:19] <+cTAKU> that was a chirp
[4:16:19] <%axellogic> I think it was Manus becoming from within you Pat
[4:16:19] <Bouldus> cute hiccup
[4:16:21] <arcaderabbit48> @xemnahort Could you elaborate? Appropriate in what way?
[4:16:26] <Yummy_Nukes> hic
[4:16:28] <%axellogic> beckoning
[4:16:32] <Laecerelius> Manus the Hand of Fate
[4:16:47] <+Nautilus_Bot> Remind me of those big guys from the beginning of DS2, they both have that sit down move
[4:17:08] <OneShotZombie> they're most definitely repurposed ogres from DS2
[4:17:15] <admiralsatan> i thought they were overfed mimics
[4:17:32] <OneShotZombie> nah they were human
[4:17:32] <%AbnormalVoid> you know you don't really get anything good from them, right?
[4:17:33] <Bouldus> @Nautilus_Bot they dooo look like the ogres from ds2
[4:17:40] <Bouldus> huh
[4:17:50] <%AbnormalVoid> DAH DUH DAH DAH DAH
[4:17:52] <+RushUnplugged> ttheir hands with 10 fingers each are the creepiest thing though
[4:17:53] <Bouldus> never thought about these things and the ds2 ogres
[4:17:53] <candidateplays> They def share moves with Ogres.
[4:17:54] <Yummy_Nukes> they comin for dat ass pat!
[4:17:56] <%badchoice5> Paige, make PAt do gooder
[4:17:56] <%xemnahort> @arcaderabbit48 everything about ds3 is about it’s the end of a cycle that’s gone on for a hell of a lot longer than it was ever meant to, the world itself is tired and broken
[4:18:04] <Coystick> They're called Monstrosity of Sin
[4:18:08] <%Faustgesicht> nice good hit pat
[4:18:09] <LtThunderbolt> niceu
[4:18:23] <%Keyd00d> strong name
[4:18:26] <%badchoice5> So, Velka then
[4:18:27] <Bouldus> yoo, sick name
[4:18:30] <+king_wragles> cool name for AWFUL ENEMIES
[4:18:49] <Bouldus> oh shit Velka is the goddess of sin isnt she
[4:18:55] <misterspotswood> that was my name in highschool. looked the same too!
[4:18:56] <+Nautilus_Bot> Soooo they’re FFX enemies lmao
[4:18:57] <Coystick> Or whatever the first sin that Aldia was obsessed over, haven't played DaS2 in yonks
[4:18:57] <Tampaoster> @PlagueOfGripes how do you think theses monsters were born?
[4:18:58] <candidateplays> profaned Capital = City of Sin
[4:19:02] <%badchoice5> They're basically DS2 Ogres but so, soooo much worse
[4:19:04] <+king_wragles> @Bouldus Yes, where are you going with this?
[4:19:10] <%Svanyr> God they make the worst sounds
[4:19:11] <heatrashes> Notes & Trivia It has more than 5 fingers on all of its hands. thank you, wikia

[4:19:32] <Coystick> @candidateplays Ayy makes sense
[4:19:33] <Bouldus> @king_wragles nowhere, i was jsut responding to badchoises comment
[4:19:34] <SeventyForce> Ah, what a... SHITTY REWARD
[4:19:36] <%Keyd00d> what noise
[4:19:38] <TerraWraith> Is it the pee noise?
[4:19:41] <Coystick> farts?
[4:19:41] <%Keyd00d> the pee noies
[4:19:42] <%hawk_rush> i hate this place
[4:19:43] <+king_wragles> IT'S THE PEE NOISE
[4:19:46] <%badchoice5> We can hear her Pat. so we can see her sleeping
[4:19:49] <Coystick> the PEE FART noise
[4:19:56] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the hand monsters have their eyes on their chest
[4:19:57] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> MAKE THR PEE NOISE
[4:20:02] <Kaitepaints> KOTOR?

[4:20:28] <%OdysseyKnight> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[4:20:30] <Bouldus> i liek that dude
[4:20:33] <Yummy_Nukes> damn dude
[4:20:34] <arcaderabbit48> @xemnahort I really have to wonder what made Miyazaki take things in such a direction. It just feels so callous compared to DS1, and we now know the story was originally going to be vastly different from what we got.
[4:20:37] <+KursedKaiju> @WhyIDie DansGame
[4:21:04] <Nighthawkmun> Why Logan?
[4:21:06] <+Gorgodrn> Not becuase they have the word sin in their name does it mean that they are related to Velka. She's more like a manager and pardoner. That why the literal pardoners exist
[4:21:08] <cizal11> i mean that's true of ds1 also
[4:21:10] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat You seen the cut content videos yet?
[4:21:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[4:21:10] <TerraWraith> Yes. Both those things
[4:21:12] <candidateplays> All of the games do it.
[4:21:19] <%xemnahort> @arcaderabbit48 hard to say I don’t know why they changed it but I personally like how it turned out a lot
[4:21:23] <candidateplays> Sulyvahn was originally the final boss.
[4:21:30] <longrat> the cut content looks AWESOME
[4:21:31] <%badchoice5> DONT FORGET THE SIEG JUMP
[4:21:33] <Zuzecha> if PAT played BLOODBOURNE with an ALL AGRO MOD would he call it RAGTIME?
[4:21:34] <longrat> i'm so sad it got removed
[4:21:35] <%forevern2dust> post it in the discord for the rest of chat
[4:21:37] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Oh, you are in for a treat
[4:21:41] <cizal11> noooooooooo
[4:21:42] <%n33t_1337> @candidateplays I would've hated if that was the final boss
[4:21:42] <OwlLightningMage> DS2 got it the worst
[4:21:50] <+Gorgodrn> The story of 3 was going to be super involved regarding time travel and shit. In early build screenshots, you could even interact with Dancer before she changed
[4:21:53] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have pontiff's swords yet?
[4:21:53] <cizal11> wait does it not chase
[4:21:54] <%hawk_rush> Bloodborne has so much cut content, god damn
[4:22:03] <benjiFG> they were invisible
[4:22:03] <candidateplays> @n33t_1337 I agree.
[4:22:04] <+5Two> DS3 was supposed to be a shmup at first
[4:22:06] <valdorick> They're invisable there
[4:22:06] <+RushUnplugged> they're there invisible
[4:22:06] <%xemnahort> Cut content always hurts because there is so much good stuff that gets axed
[4:22:06] <%forevern2dust> @OwlLightningMage DS2 felt like it was made from cut content
[4:22:07] <%Faustgesicht> invisible
[4:22:08] <cizal11> they're invisible right there
[4:22:08] <candidateplays> They're invisible.
[4:22:09] <%n33t_1337> Invisible
[4:22:11] <longrat> the bloodborne cut content hurts me
[4:22:11] <cizal11> the message isn't lying
[4:22:14] <KoyaMusa> all of the queens from ds2's names were in the files before the dlc was announced
[4:22:16] <longrat> there is SO MUCH cut content
[4:22:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yes
[4:22:17] <%n33t_1337> Thry pop in after you pass by
[4:22:18] <valdorick> and then see your sexy health bar and go "Oh boy, we want that"
[4:22:18] <candidateplays> You can see them from the other side of the window.
[4:22:19] <%badchoice5> Inivisblessed
[4:22:19] <%bevyrage> @angriestpat save onion?
[4:22:20] <DatAsuna> persaonlly the ds1 cut content ws the biggest bummers for me
[4:22:21] <+Tylermcd93> Idk I loved DS3's final boss even if it was easy. It was so thematically good
[4:22:24] <%Faustgesicht> by the window
[4:22:26] <%Keyd00d> Dark Souls 3 was originally going to be a fighting game with Visual Novel elements
[4:22:28] <MrMagicConch> NOT just invisible. I don't think you can attack them at all before they appear
[4:22:29] <arcaderabbit48> @xemnahort I just feel like it could have been done better. Like, if everything has to do, at least have the Darkwraiths do it instead of those stupid goatmen.
[4:22:29] <+Noxybaru> They're just invisible. Complete nonsense mechanic seen nowhere else
[4:22:32] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat do you have pontiff's swords yet?
[4:22:33] <DatAsuna> DS2 had downgrdes but not as many cool bosses and lore cuts
[4:22:37] <longrat> yes you can @MrMagicConch
[4:22:38] <Liwyn> did it get cut cause of time or cause it was bad?
[4:22:46] <+Gorgodrn> Bloodborne cut content is mostly elaborations on known lore. With the exception of the bosses, not much was truly lost
[4:22:48] <OwlLightningMage> DS2 was originally a game from the ground up about time travel
[4:22:49] <+landslide313> I'm new to DS1 any tips or help? @angriestpat
[4:22:55] <+Gorgodrn> Merely to rpeserve the game's apcing
[4:22:56] <MrMagicConch> Those jailers are the worst mechanic
[4:22:57] <Nepsotic> Pat low-key disconnected his internet that's why we can't invade him.
[4:22:58] <%xemnahort> @arcaderabbit48 on that we can easily agree
[4:23:01] <+Gorgodrn> pacing*
[4:23:03] <%hawk_rush> @Gorgodrn I could use some more lore tho
[4:23:09] <Coystick> Sent @AngriestPat
[4:23:09] <%n33t_1337> Hahaha
[4:23:14] <%Keyd00d> ah ah eh
[4:23:14] <+Gorgodrn> It's the same, only longer
[4:23:15] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat they have 110 ice, so you can freeze and burn and freeze again, it's busted
[4:23:17] <OwlLightningMage> They had to completely scrap most of it because none of it worked
[4:23:20] <%n33t_1337> ah ah eh
[4:23:25] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Covitious Kappa
[4:23:28] <%Faustgesicht> best friend is safe to kill other best friend, yay
[4:23:29] <longrat> oh yeah it looks fucking amazing
[4:23:34] <%forevern2dust> @AngriestPat any plans to play Borderlands 2 VR?
[4:23:36] <+Gorgodrn> And things people infered were mostly correct so there's that
[4:23:43] <+ShinHadokenman> How big are Pats numbers? Can he beat Jiren yet?
[4:23:45] <Tampaoster> !uptime
[4:23:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 23m 47s.
[4:23:50] <Zuzecha> HEY PAT, i would buy YOUR cut content ;)
[4:24:02] <Djinnazz> Pat's tummy is too weak.
[4:24:03] <%Faustgesicht> that's a thing? woof, that sounds awful
[4:24:06] <arcaderabbit48> @Liwyn DS3's cut content is so vastly different from what we got, its hard to say if its really good or bad. I think it would have been much more interesting, but its really hard to say. Probably would have made more sense if nothign else, its pretty clear where stuff got cut and replaced.
[4:24:07] <Coystick> It always seems cooler when it's cut
[4:24:08] <%xemnahort> @forevern2dust bl2 has vr now?
[4:24:11] <+JenovasPuppet> Borderlands VR sounds vomit inducing
[4:24:12] <OwlLightningMage> Coward Yhorm time BibleThump
[4:24:18] <DatAsuna> Pat got it real bad in the cut content department yeah
[4:24:20] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat you have an estus shard
[4:24:25] <+Gravity_Gunner> Pat won’t be streaming Borderlands 2 VR because he’s weak.
[4:24:25] <%forevern2dust> @xemnahort they are re-re-releasing it with vr
[4:24:29] <+Noxybaru> I cannot think of something I want to do less than play Borderlands 2 through a second time, VR or no
[4:24:34] <Liwyn> @arcaderabbit48 oh ok ty
[4:24:35] <+CyberTheory> @angriestpat your my favorite person named pat in your house.
[4:24:41] <KoyaMusa> instead of make a new game cause poor little randy got all that money stolen, what shame to such a good guy
[4:24:43] <DatAsuna> Youmight say it cut him off at the nees
[4:24:44] <+JenovasPuppet> BIG LIES
[4:24:49] <MrMagicConch> BIG WRONG
[4:24:54] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> l i e s
[4:24:54] <%Faustgesicht> shove your face right into anthony burch's 10 year old memes
[4:24:55] <+G_Thunders> @gorgodrn I’d say it’s way more than that. Bloodborne had an entire straightforward story originally. And there’s unused or unrecorded dialogue from like a dozen NPC’s.
[4:24:55] <@Fuggins4U> I fell asleep on the couch
[4:24:56] <+Press_X_ToJASON> @arfsm95 shame the liar!
[4:25:05] <+Skatedeandre> you're my 3rd favourite pat moon2S

[4:25:06] <%badchoice5> You're my third favorite P name in your house
[4:25:07] <%bevyrage> i like how the short BL2 vr commercial is 'put on helmet, see axe land next to head, remove helmet'
[4:25:13] <%DedlokPM> Elmo is my favorite thing named Pat in Pat's house. teenJOY
[4:25:15] <arfsm95> @Press_X_ToJASON i think he had, he used and i didn't see it
[4:25:16] <%xemnahort> Bl2 with vr sounds incredibly pointless and not a big enough draw to go back
[4:25:17] <@Mechz71> Hey fuggins do you wanna shitpost at pat with me
[4:25:20] <andyspz> its everyones favourtie fuggins
[4:25:21] <@Fuggins4U> I was man, it's just a reall comfy couch

[4:31:55] <arcaderabbit48> I want to like Warframe so much, but it is just so dull to play
[4:31:56] <xeros720> human children can not compete with Elmo
[4:31:58] <+RushUnplugged> Elmo is draining her strength, and that's FINE
[4:32:01] <OwlLightningMage> People are unworthy of love. I should know
[4:32:12] <Coystick> Vampelmo
[4:32:17] <%crimsonharvest> my own fluff son is outside playing and wont come in

[4:32:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 32m 24s.
[4:32:23] <Zuzecha> uhoh
[4:32:23] <Bouldus> people in general dont compete with my dogs
[4:32:24] <%imextremelymanly> gross

[4:32:42] <%tiishi> apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong
[4:32:42] <OwlLightningMage> The bag is filled wit hopes and dreams
[4:32:43] <$MightyMaxT> Ah cahnt believe you've done this
[4:32:43] <Coystick> Grab him by the baggy.
[4:32:44] <+RushUnplugged> you cowards still haven't invaded him
[4:32:46] <KoyaMusa> but it is allowed to do it
[4:32:47] <Bouldus> #Elmotoo? Kappa maybe too much
[4:32:48] <%Keyd00d> Bag status: grabbed
[4:32:52] <Zuzecha> yesa
[4:32:53] <medril07> quick run to the boss room
[4:32:56] <+thebestestkevin> wat
[4:33:01] <Bouldus> maybe that was too much
[4:33:02] <OwlLightningMage> I hate how little sense it makes
[4:33:03] <TerraWraith> People are bags of shit. Fill them up with water, and it has to come out somewhere. Animals are the babies
[4:33:05] <arcaderabbit48> Shaking the peepee's bag fills you with DETERMINATION
[4:33:09] <cizal11> is it because it's unclear though
[4:33:09] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why?
[4:33:12] <%badchoice5> But Anor Londo is in DS3....
[4:33:18] <Coystick> It was supposed to be Wolnir's palace
[4:33:25] <+RushUnplugged> it's all that's left if the capital and only because Yohrm is there
[4:33:29] <+FloorBurger> Tower of Latria Remix
[4:33:31] <phoenix_games87> Vaati explains it
[4:33:32] <+Jack8274> Jebaited
[4:33:32] <OwlLightningMage> Why is there an undying flame here? It makes no fucking sense at all
[4:33:33] <NiftyNox> Much like many areas of DkS2, it'd make a great place for a spinoff story
[4:33:34] <LtThunderbolt> Fear of the unknown
[4:33:39] <Zuzecha> HEY PAT, would POISE ruin DS3 for you now?
[4:33:39] <%hawk_rush> @Coystick oh shit, rea;lly?
[4:33:41] <+G_Thunders> I think it’s unclear because it’s unfinished...
[4:33:45] <Zombrocom> This place is CLEARLY super unfinished
[4:33:47] <Coystick> Allegedly
[4:33:52] <%n33t_1337> DS2 was more of a spinoff area
[4:33:54] <%FadingEmber> @AngriestPat you love things that are cryptic and unclear Pat
[4:33:55] <+too_effing_old> Look at these Dr Who monsters
[4:34:01] <medril07> both chests are safe pat
[4:34:02] <OwlLightningMage> This area feels like fan fiction
[4:34:05] <+Mikatonic> why is pat streaming at 2:30am...
[4:34:06] <%Chichen> apatDab
[4:34:08] <Coystick> Look at Wolnir he's replete with jewels
[4:34:18] <Coystick> Look at the capital, full of jewels
[4:34:23] <%Keyd00d> "we're geniuses" "OH NO"
[4:34:24] <LtThunderbolt> KICK
[4:34:32] <arcaderabbit48> What is with this game's massive hard on for Mimic's
[4:34:37] <NiftyNox> You did it Eric, you broke down DARK SOULS to its basic elements!
[4:34:43] <TerraWraith> The chest
[4:34:46] <+yandereboyfriend> was it meant to be a solution?
[4:34:46] <%n33t_1337> I liked Dark Souls 2 third choice ending
[4:34:47] <longrat> @arcaderabbit48 the base game has more mimics than regular chests
[4:34:47] <cizal11> pat the other chest
[4:34:48] <Bouldus> i missed what that was about
[4:34:51] <TerraWraith> You mised the actual chest you hit
[4:34:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> chest
[4:34:54] <cizal11> oh my god lmao
[4:34:57] <+Jack8274> We better be getting some Onion bro for this boss
[4:34:57] <LtThunderbolt> kicks or punches?
[4:35:05] <%badchoice5> The only solution that seemed to actually "work" was the Frozen King, at least that I can think of
[4:35:07] <Tampaoster> Put the flame out
[4:35:09] <arcaderabbit48> @longrat I heard that, yes. And literally your first chest is a Mimic
[4:35:12] <+drypegasustwitch> I love you pat
[4:35:13] <Tampaoster> tis profane
[4:35:14] <Tampaoster> auhuaha
[4:35:24] <candidateplays> City is sinful, creates the Flame of sin, it needs to be purged - Yhorm links the fire, it needs humanity to burn, kills the entire city.
[4:35:30] <DrDomVonDoom> “We didn’t start the 🔥 “
[4:35:31] <OwlLightningMage> Propane capital
[4:35:34] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat CUT CONTENT
[4:35:34] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat you hit a chest to see if it was a Mimic and didn’t open it near the mimics
[4:35:38] <%AbnormalVoid> They're jooools, betty
[4:35:43] <candidateplays> There's not a whole lot to go on, but there's not a lot of mystery to it either
[4:35:44] <+Jack8274> It was in the trailer
[4:35:47] <Zuzecha> hey pat, would you like an actual punch build for the next SOULS clone
[4:35:47] <@Mechz71> This place is supposedly where the first Anor Londo is and the othere Anor Londos are fake.
[4:35:55] <TerraWraith> Whatever is is in the chest back there was probably good
[4:35:58] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat First video of Wol'nir was in a room that looks nearly identical to Yhorms room
[4:36:02] <Bouldus> @OwlLightningMage o// i enjoyed that :P
[4:36:03] <+yandereboyfriend> i thought the profaned flame was its own weird thing
[4:36:06] <+G_Thunders> One of the trailers has wolnir in this boss room iirc
[4:36:13] <OwlLightningMage> I hate this area so much. The deep is also pretty stupid.
[4:36:16] <@Mechz71> no problem
[4:36:17] <Coystick> Cut content, Wolnir was a covenant leader and Carthus was fighting the Abyss Watchers
[4:36:18] <candidateplays> It's in the trailer, but he's clipping into the pillars in that trailer
[4:36:18] <Bouldus> propane capital :P
[4:36:18] <DrDomVonDoom> Yhorms room where the magic happens
[4:36:23] <OwlLightningMage> LUL
[4:36:27] <+Felremi> Chest missed back where the ladies were
[4:36:36] <%tiishi> ^
[4:36:37] <%AbnormalVoid> gaht dangit, Siegward
[4:36:42] <%Chichen> Im one of those people that have too many hours in these games
[4:36:43] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Yhorm originally had Wolnir's model, and was fought here. A lot of boss models were swapped around in this game, its kinda crazy
[4:36:46] <Zuzecha> THE CORNER
[4:36:47] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> by the mimics
[4:36:48] <%TaifuDragon> honk
[4:36:48] <+Jack8274> @candidateplays Clipping in Dark Souls? Never! LUL
[4:36:50] <%xemnahort> @angriestpat you missed a chest near the mimics
[4:36:52] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat near mimics
[4:36:52] <TerraWraith> Over by the 2 mimics
[4:36:53] <%thewinged7> with the mimics
[4:36:54] <Pajex_> by the mimcs
[4:36:55] <cizal11> near the two mimics
[4:36:56] <Nepsotic> cannot understand why I'm unable to invade you, this is frustrating as balls
[4:36:59] <+Felremi> lol
[4:37:04] <TerraWraith> you hit it then walked away
[4:37:14] <+Jack8274> @Nepsotic What level are you?
[4:37:15] <Zael913> Alright people, I'm thinking of buying this on steam with the season pass. It's a little over $25 American. I've already played and beaten all DLC and this game on PS4, but I have a hankering to play it again. Should I get it?
[4:37:17] <Zuzecha> TOLD YOU
[4:37:17] <OwlLightningMage> That would explain why Yhorm and Wolnir feel out of place
[4:37:19] <Nepsotic> 67
[4:37:21] <cizal11> it's fucking nothing lmao
[4:37:22] <%DedlokPM> All of that for an ember. teenJOY
[4:37:23] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> gg chat
[4:37:25] <VJdarkworld> @nepsotic game priorities coop players over solo
[4:37:27] <Pajex_> run saved
[4:37:41] <%Faustgesicht> good music time
[4:37:41] <+LogothX> So just sit there like normal
[4:37:44] <OwlLightningMage> PAIGE WILL NOT REMEMBER THIS
[4:37:47] <+Jack8274> @Zael913 Nows a better time than any with the sale. It's pretty busy co-op and PVP wise
[4:37:48] <Nepsotic> true but you can still invade solo players, been trying for hours
[4:37:48] <arcaderabbit48> Pretty sure this is also why Wulnir had his skull goblet, and thos whole area is littered with goblets and cups? I dunno, might be looking too far in at that point
[4:37:50] <%Keyd00d> Is Paige going to play 2 and 3 at some point?
[4:37:51] <Coystick> And nothing changed
[4:37:52] <+Spryman> Challenge mode, don't use the weapon
[4:37:53] <+JenovasPuppet> D'aaaaw
[4:37:55] <@Mechz71> Paige is the expert of turning off brains
[4:37:55] <%FrostMass22> Maternal, Emlo is training for the baby
[4:37:55] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> mommy paige
[4:38:00] <%tiishi> apatElmo
[4:38:01] <%Keyd00d> HYAAAAH
[4:38:02] <NiftyNox> HYAGGH
[4:38:04] <%SergeEXE> HYAAAAH
[4:38:06] <Zael913> @Jack8274 Welp, I s'pose I should
[4:38:08] <TheBlankAce> Pat don't fuck it up
[4:38:08] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat lupus will fog her mind
[4:38:08] <Nepsotic> welp, that's that then
[4:38:10] <Bouldus> @Keyd00d yea thats why shes not really paying attention to the game
[4:38:12] <$ooblagis> This boss is so lame
[4:38:12] <+claudesavegely> Go Go Onion bro!
[4:38:13] <Intolerable> ONION BRO
[4:38:15] <OwlLightningMage> NOT PAT
[4:38:20] <+JenovasPuppet> Shouldn't have told her she was warm and nice and sweet
[4:38:21] <OwlLightningMage> NOT THE COWARD WAY
[4:38:21] <cizal11> LMFAO
[4:38:21] <%Keyd00d> INVENTORY
[4:38:22] <%SergeEXE> LUL
[4:38:22] <+LogothX> Inventory!
[4:38:25] <$ooblagis> HE'S DYING PAT
[4:38:25] <captainthunderwolf> JUST FIND IT
[4:38:26] <%Spydurman> LUL
[4:38:26] <Nepsotic> such an epic boss
[4:38:27] <OwlLightningMage> FIGHT HIM LEGIT
[4:38:28] <%xemnahort> @keyd00d she said during this stream she’ll play 2 in January
[4:38:28] <Coystick> Yhorm was originally the tutorial boss, not Iudex
[4:38:29] <%DedlokPM> CAN YOU FEEL THE STORM? sbfpBaz
[4:38:30] <+LethargicRush> HIS GREATEST WEAKNESS just laying there
[4:38:31] <Bouldus> GOOOO SIEGWARD
[4:38:35] <spucifer> onion boiiiiii
[4:38:36] <OwlLightningMage> LAME
[4:38:38] <+Jack8274> So bad ass
[4:38:44] <OwlLightningMage> BibleThump
[4:38:46] <%Keyd00d> Ah okay thanks buds, I haven't been here for the whole stream
[4:38:46] <%Chichen> its bad
[4:38:47] <Nepsotic> @lethargicrush Because it was a gift
[4:38:48] <$ooblagis> It sucks
[4:38:52] <candidateplays> it blows
[4:38:52] <OwlLightningMage> FIGHT IT LEGIT THEN
[4:38:53] <+Nobrev> kinda bad
[4:38:53] <%SergeEXE> BIG THROW BACK
[4:38:54] <Shraquet> Shouldn't you get his attention?
[4:38:55] <%n33t_1337> it's shit
[4:38:56] <TerraWraith> It's not good
[4:38:57] <%Freelance7> It's a gimmick fight
[4:38:58] <%SergeEXE> NOT GOOD
[4:38:58] <+Freelance_Astronaut> It's a gimmick fight
[4:38:59] <candidateplays> It's a massive let down
[4:38:59] <%hawk_rush> it's awful
[4:38:59] <andyspz> its bad
[4:39:00] <Tampaoster> its gimmicky as fuck
[4:39:00] <Zombrocom> This fight is actually pretty cool if you fight it without storm ruler
[4:39:01] <limeyprick> boring gay shit
[4:39:01] <valdorick> It would be better if there was more to it.
[4:39:02] <%Faustgesicht> tag team that gaint with your wind penises
[4:39:02] <+RushUnplugged> Yhorm wants to die, that's why he has the SR there and gave one to his friend Siegward
[4:39:04] <Pajex_> watch out... ResidentSleeper
[4:39:05] <Nepsotic> Great fight
[4:39:05] <+Jack8274> It's trying to be like Demons Souls tribute
[4:39:06] <+thebestestkevin> abyss watchers is so good it makes yhorm look even worse
[4:39:06] <Coystick> Sucks because it was repurposed
[4:39:06] <andyspz> it could have been REALLY cool, but its not
[4:39:07] <Star_K4398> It looks cool but easy
[4:39:09] <Xystant> WIND SCAR
[4:39:11] <+G_Thunders> In DeS at least you were hitting a moving target
[4:39:14] <TheBlankAce> I love it thematically but it sucks gameplay wise
[4:39:14] <Zael913> This boss fight is too gimmicky. Would have been better as the first boos fight as it was originally planned imo
[4:39:16] <longrat> this boss sucks
[4:39:16] <+bobopipe> Is he literally shooting wind from a sword?
[4:39:17] <arcaderabbit48> This fight reminds me of Demon Souls, for a lot of obvious and not good reasons
[4:39:17] <$ooblagis> Even the Demon's Souls version of this at least had you dodge ranged attacks
[4:39:18] <Jontman42> I wish it was an actual fight
[4:39:21] <Zuzecha> ONION BRO = BEST CHARACTER OF THE FRANCHISE
[4:39:23] <+JenovasPuppet> Good job, wind sword!
[4:39:26] <%Metballs> you've got 2 layers of cheese, Pat
[4:39:26] <Liwyn> it was super cool the first time tho
[4:39:26] <Coystick> He looks so cool though
[4:39:29] <OwlLightningMage> Pat did it the bad way BibleThump
[4:39:30] <valdorick> Have the slash be sideways, and force you to like, climb up the pillars so you can stormcleave his face or something
[4:39:34] <phoenix_games87> I didnt know about the sword and beat him witout it 1st time
[4:39:35] <+Felremi> badass
[4:39:36] <limeyprick> you all might'd him yeah
[4:39:38] <DracaenaLeaf> don't talk to him
[4:39:38] <Coystick> One of the best looking bosses in the game, at least
[4:39:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> cool
[4:39:40] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat I CLAPPED I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE STORM RULER 4head200
[4:39:40] <%thewinged7> time for a nice nap
[4:39:40] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Yhorm the Gimmick
[4:39:44] <DeaconTNR> Yeah Yhorms turns out to be a jobber
[4:39:45] <srkAres> good job, onion bro
[4:39:47] <Jontman42> If they just made normal weapons work on him it would be good
[4:39:49] <+FloorBurger> Remember Demon's Souls? We remember.
[4:39:53] <Nepsotic> still better than most ds2 bosses lol
[4:39:56] <Zombrocom> You can stun him to get ripostes on his head which makes for a much more interesting fight
[4:40:00] <Intolerable> HAVE A DRINK WITH ONION BRO
[4:40:00] <%Spydurman> gimmick fights only work if the gimmick, lore, or fight is good. This has none of those
[4:40:01] <%badchoice5> gimmick fights are often unsatisfying
[4:40:02] <OwlLightningMage> Normal weapons DO work on him
[4:40:02] <Zombrocom> If you don't use the storm ruler
[4:40:03] <%TaifuDragon> not at all
[4:40:03] <+Jack8274> Not well at least
[4:40:04] <+Felremi> hit for 20
[4:40:06] <+JenovasPuppet> Onion IMMEDIATELY sits down. Chillest mofo alive. Err, undead.
[4:40:07] <Bouldus> they do fuck all
[4:40:07] <OwlLightningMage> They totally do
[4:40:08] <Coystick> Imagine how fucking cool he'd be if he still had his giant shield
[4:40:08] <candidateplays> You have to hit him in the head
[4:40:09] <Djinnazz> they do, they just do shit DMG
[4:40:10] <Zael913> Normal weapons work, it just takes a WHILE
[4:40:10] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat They do very little. You can knock him down and stuff but very very little
[4:40:12] <Zombrocom> They work fine
[4:40:14] <Mesonoxian_Methuselah> they work, he just has a shit ton of HP
[4:40:15] <%Metballs> they're fine
[4:40:16] <%Divryne> No he just has a fuckton of HP.
[4:40:16] <$ooblagis> It's like fighting Vendrick without the Giant Souls
[4:40:17] <%DedlokPM> *fights it with a weapon that THE DEVS PUT IN THE ROOM and INTENTIONALLY PUT IN FOR THE FIGHT" "WHY DON'T YOU FIGHT IT LEGIT?" mogsW
[4:40:19] <Nepsotic> yhorms lore is awesone
[4:40:21] <$ooblagis> They technically work
[4:40:22] <LixFury> he has so much hp
[4:40:24] <+deanbees> I didn't even know the stormruler was an option originally. I killed him with bleed procs.
[4:40:24] <+G_Thunders> I clapped when the onion knight sat down. Just like in DS1!
[4:40:25] <cizal11> you can kill him with a normal weapon, it just takes forever because he has so much hp
[4:40:25] <+Noxybaru> It's like a 20-30 minute fight without them
[4:40:26] <candidateplays> You can do a bunch of poise damage to his feet, and he keels over
[4:40:28] <%Keyd00d> the pat breathe deep
[4:40:32] <Jontman42> He takes half an hour to kill with normal
[4:40:36] <+thebestestkevin> also he has so few attacks
[4:40:37] <+Amplificate> @AngriestPat I accidentally killed Seigward with that sword before. The 2.5k damage that it does fully charged registerd to both the boss and Seigward at the same time killing him. Sad day then
[4:40:44] <Zombrocom> You can knock him down and reposte his head for MASSIVE damage
[4:40:47] <OwlLightningMage> No one knows the other way to fight him LUL
[4:40:48] <Coystick> Good work Stormruler
[4:40:49] <+thebestestkevin> so it just gets boring to fight

[4:42:16] <NiftyNox> Pat did you think the final DLC boss did a good job as a final farewell to the series?
[4:42:16] <Zael913> So re-bought the game on steam
[4:42:17] <GueyDuckB> Is he just naked now?
[4:42:23] <Coystick> Pure entropy
[4:42:27] <+Felremi> he ded
[4:42:28] <%n33t_1337> WORLD IS FUCKED
[4:42:29] <Nepsotic> the world is always ending in DS, it's nothing new
[4:42:30] <%AbnormalVoid> quick everyone, escape into a painting
[4:42:32] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Wasn't end a good thing?
[4:42:34] <OwlLightningMage> Gael is the only part of the DLCs I actually like
[4:42:38] <Bouldus> @GueyDuckB he no longer had any drive and went holow
[4:42:39] <medril07> he's naked somewhere
[4:42:42] <$ooblagis> The other games are about the shadow of death, DS3 is actually about death
[4:42:42] <Zael913> I kinda miss the world tendency stuff from DES
[4:42:46] <+Gravity_Gunner> So just like real life, then?
[4:42:49] <Zael913> It was a neat mechanic
[4:42:51] <$serpenttucker> @AngriestPat Isn't it implied or straight up stated that this shit is cyclical and that it will all happen again?
[4:42:58] <%Chichen> World tendency was a good idea, poor execution imo.
[4:42:59] <captainthunderwolf> World Tendency was cool but way too arbitrary and obscure.
[4:43:07] <Coystick> I mean the Dreg Heap is just high fantasy version of the Big Crunch
[4:43:11] <captainthunderwolf> Yeah wow, two of us in a row said exactly the same thing.
[4:43:13] <Nepsotic> @serpenttucker that's a DS2 thing mainly
[4:43:13] <%xemnahort> Ds3 is more the world was supposed to end a long ass time ago and because it didn’t everything is fucked
[4:43:19] <Bouldus> yeyeye
[4:43:19] <Jontman42> It fits that Dark Souls 3 is a "forced" continuation of the series that must really end now
[4:43:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ye
[4:43:20] <%Chichen> @captainthunderwolf apatDab
[4:43:21] <KoyaMusa> exile set?

[4:43:24] <%Keyd00d> ye
[4:43:25] <Bouldus> aww
[4:43:25] <Zael913> It was, but it added more weight to death and such
[4:43:30] <Coystick> Become CHONK
[4:43:31] <Bouldus> yeyeye
[4:43:35] <misterspotswood> killed to be undead, world is a fuck, kull em all 2016, i am the undead, 410,757,864,530 souls
[4:43:36] <OwlLightningMage> The end of the DLCs implies that it's all actually done
[4:43:37] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Fully layered
[4:43:38] <Nepsotic> @jontman42 despite being leagues better than 2?
[4:43:43] <+RushUnplugged> linking the fire repeats things, but every time it's worse, which is why the dark end is the best
[4:43:51] <captainthunderwolf> Dark Souls 3 is Miyazaki saying, "I'm out of ideas, you fucks!"
[4:44:02] <captainthunderwolf> And someone else says, "Let someone else write it! It's easy!"
[4:44:11] <captainthunderwolf> And Miyazaki starts shouting about tree worms and fire.
[4:44:18] <NiftyNox> uggee
