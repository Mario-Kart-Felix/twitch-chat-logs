[0:13:29] <+Weeewer> this is league of legends except youre not locked into 30 min doomers

[0:13:49] <LorcaNomad> I'm actually really hoping for fortnite to come back actually
[0:13:49] <+Dustin_Gunn> @bigshedman because it's impossible to score vs any competent team so every match becomes "who kills zapdos"
[0:13:49] <+Weeewer> Pika is solid in this
[0:13:51] <%Movemeister> I’m imagining Pat just shrinking down into the Pokemon world like the mainline games now
[0:13:53] <mrblitzstream> next up on the podcast.... Tierlists for Pokemon Unite

[0:14:35] <Laioken13> DONT YOU FUCKING TALK SHIT ABOUT WARTORTLE
[0:14:36] <%The_Protagonist> also I love that this game literally shows Pokemon de-evolving like in Digimon, which means they could implement that in future games
[0:14:38] <ChungusQuest> """""knock out"""""
[0:14:38] <dekkitout> Hit em wit a dunda bolt

[0:14:45] <%BoxNavy> knock out? the fuckin thing got deleted
[0:14:46] <insomniac_doze_> COLLECT THEIR SOULS
[0:14:46] <+Mr___Pillow> when you get to the main menu you can change in game settings so B auto paths to minions and A for players instead of proximity when just A

[0:15:08] <%Sol_Install> MONEY
[0:15:08] <%killsareFALL0UT> sheesh
[0:15:09] <+Das_Prints> @patstaresat There’s a setting you can turn on that lets you pick target priority between players and mobs for auto attacks. By default it aims for the closest target.
[0:15:09] <%TheYellowcouch> they made it real good
[0:15:11] <+sonofthedeepsouth> WHEN YOU KNOK A MOFUCKA
[0:15:12] <+alphonseisbest> the frames WILL drop in match PAT
[0:15:12] <jumpyhugs> Dunkacinno
[0:15:12] <2DSuperiority> sooo it super goes down during a real game
[0:15:12] <%Treuan> Amazing what Pokemon money can do with competent devs
[0:15:13] <+Infernal_Dalek> Tencent moneyyyyy....Switch is a powerhouse compared to mobile phone
[0:15:15] <Solvari> I mean the assets don't look overly high fidelity
[0:15:15] <+Gouf_Troop> switch games can run good if you optimize
[0:15:16] <bigshedman> Wait till you get online, maybe it'll run worse then...
[0:15:16] <%Sotetsu> It's gotta run on mobile, so it makes sense.
[0:15:17] <%TheYellowcouch> YUPP
[0:15:17] <+D00msDayDan> i can, it looks pretty basic
[0:15:17] <+Dustin_Gunn> Wait until you feel the menu lag, @PatStaresAt
[0:15:17] <DianaTheAscian> I don't know what you said
[0:15:19] <+TaurusOxford> tencent - better pokemon game makers than Gamefreak. LUL
[0:15:19] <+haitakaa> LUL Swery
[0:15:21] <SuperInhuman> space jam 2 needed pikachu
[0:15:21] <Manwad> optimized beyond measure
[0:15:21] <quietshun> The menues lag tho, unfortunately
[0:15:22] <Portal_Operater> Dunk on them Pikachu.
[0:15:23] <+redyoshi5> wait till you see how laggy the menu is it makes no since
[0:15:24] <dekkitout> You tellin me Tencent made a decent Moba? Wha?
[0:15:24] <Necnill> Hades???
[0:15:25] <%coward_man> this game runs and plays better than mainline pokemon games!
[0:15:25] <+armormog> it kind of bogs down hard in game at points
[0:15:26] <%solracc25> Because money pat
[0:15:26] <+BigNerdSam> GUESS WHO CAN'T PULL THIS OFF: NINTENDO
[0:15:26] <Profmcstevie> Now watch it crash/stutter loading
[0:15:27] <%BoxNavy> this is also a mobile game
[0:15:27] <Baljhet> I mean, how much does it even need to render at once?
[0:15:28] <%SvenHolgersson> YEYEYEYEYEYEEYYEEY BEST MON RIGHT THERE
[0:15:29] <+alphonseisbest> WAIT till u get in match pat

[0:15:31] <+Delenay> itll probably shit the bed when theres more then 1 player
[0:15:32] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Ah, the overrated one
[0:15:34] <Dangan12> pat it will run on phone, optimisation is a must
[0:15:35] <lyzejag> MAKE EVERY GAMES A GACHA
[0:15:36] <+Mr___Pillow> wired is a must wifi drops hard
[0:15:36] <%spitelite> so nintendo
[0:15:39] <%RaziWraith> If they gave Wartortle sunglasses, ya'll would probably think he was cool. :(
[0:15:39] <+Rigid_Iguana> yeah bro why cant the witcher 3 run like this Kappa
[0:15:43] <dickbuttwoman> The game is Realllllllllly simple
[0:15:43] <+Weeewer> the menus are ACTUALLY the worst part of the game, theyre so rough
[0:15:44] <%The_Protagonist> @TaurusOxford to be fair, everyone else that makes a Pokemon game seems to make a better one
[0:15:45] <%cylish> Kinda makes me upset Riders still chugs
[0:15:45] <+kewlmyc> To be fair, there's one map. It's not like it's open world.

[0:27:19] <+LowBatteryLife> gonna be a 8 month thing
[0:27:19] <%JumboCrunchies> It depends on how often they update
[0:27:19] <Explodincatz> hell no

[0:27:22] <Lunatyr64> yes
[0:27:22] <VentWilsn> who knows
[0:27:23] <TheMadBadger> Honestly, i hope so. It's fun as a casual league alternative
[0:27:24] <dan_g_v> cant include 1k pokemon right at once , Pat
[0:27:24] <+OddityOn> they already added Gardevoir a day or two ago
[0:27:25] <+D00msDayDan> it's not made by nintendo so maybe
[0:27:25] <ChungusQuest> too soon to tello
[0:27:26] <%Agami23> this will be cancelled within the year
[0:27:27] <+sonofthedeepsouth> YUP
[0:27:28] <%dankjerri> you KNOW septile will be in it
[0:27:28] <+Das_Prints> Blast pose and Clefable are planned to be added sometime soon.
[0:27:29] <%Ynkubus_> What tournament tho
[0:27:29] <%coward_man> well pokemon put money into it to make it run good so YES
[0:27:30] <+fetrigon> prints money tbh
[0:27:30] <%The_Protagonist> Blastoise is getting added in a couple of weeks prob
[0:27:31] <+Vigonept> theyre already adding new pokemon
[0:27:31] <+MandoZ3R0> claim Zeraora for free from your messages
[0:27:31] <%hrbeck_> It’s gonna be a thing
[0:27:31] <%GarbageNirvana> Depends on how much money it makes
[0:27:31] <2DSuperiority> some skins change the vfx and sounds like in league
[0:27:31] <%MrUnKnownAlien> yea seems like it
[0:27:32] <%Ne1son> @PatStaresAt Bet it shuts down in 1 to 2 years with no warning
[0:27:37] <DaKnightWarrior> you know what...maybe not.
[0:27:38] <%solracc25> maybe?
[0:27:38] <+BigNerdSam> I anticipate the next Castle Superbeast Episode where you talk about how sick Pokemon Unite is to Woolie, who has already written it off.
[0:27:38] <Saltedoasis> depends on how much money it makes probably
[0:27:39] <+sonofthedeepsouth> NOPE
[0:27:41] <%TheYellowcouch> orb man
[0:27:42] <marvel877> Its more The Pokemon Company's thing than Nintendo's thing.
[0:27:44] <+polothegreatest> they never supported pokken BibleThump
[0:27:46] <mrblitzstream> for now atleast, league started with less
[0:27:46] <%Movemeister> It’ll be a mobile thing
[0:27:47] <+Dustin_Gunn> I guess P2W games can get pretty popular
[0:27:50] <%viewtifulr> the gragus of pokemans
[0:27:51] <%dankjerri> no video examples?
[0:27:51] <+lordericter> Flail is trash
[0:27:54] <+Weeewer> heavy slam is SO good
[0:27:56] <$jacob2pop> To be fair LoL has been out for 12 years, so they have a bit of a head start on roster soze
[0:27:56] <SnorlaxBud> Flail
[0:27:57] <VentWilsn> maybe Unite will only be a switch thing, nintendo has been know to do dumb shit like that
[0:28:00] <artificiallynatural> well pokemon masters is still a thing so I'd be surprised if this wasnt supported for at least a year
[0:28:03] <%Deano8817> lail bad
[0:28:04] <theanora1> Heavy Slam is broken AF
[0:28:09] <+Vigonept> i like flail for the burst of speed and damage
[0:28:13] <%GigaSeifer> @VentWilsn it's coming to mobile
[0:28:14] <TheFakeBob> Flail is good if you're better than the opponent
[0:28:18] <critiquequartz> Did you get zenora?
[0:28:18] <Moondoggie25> Unite is already confirmed to be coming to phones
[0:28:19] <Baljhet> you can move while blocking
[0:28:22] <critiquequartz> From the mail
[0:28:23] <+Weeewer> block can perma stun opponents
[0:28:25] <TonutWasTaken> what are pokemans
[0:28:28] <TheMadBadger> @lordericter Flail is god-tier if you build it right. I've out-dueled Absol with DPS Snorlax.
[0:28:29] <jumpyhugs> blcok is hella wide
[0:28:33] <+Vigonept> it also stuns
[0:28:36] <JudgeParadox> woooo pokemon and pat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[0:28:37] <jumpyhugs> like 3/4 of a lane
[0:28:38] <%The_Protagonist> Block is real good
[0:28:38] <%BoxNavy> you can sandwich people with block its funny
[0:28:41] <%HaroldDonchee> basically anivia

[0:49:15] <Louie_Salmon> You don't want basically anything automatic
[0:49:15] <%TopTierHarley> Press is mash actually
[0:49:17] <TehMud> Got it
[0:49:20] <+Yudouuuuuuu> yeah;. so you don't automatically move towards enemies
[0:49:20] <%GobbleLynn> because B is also how you cancel your spells
[0:49:22] <kingluckyday100> Certain characters make auto basic terrible
[0:49:22] <+hdawger> thank fuck he turned on advance control
[0:49:25] <+Mr___Pillow> auto pathing when basic attack

[0:49:38] <+Vigonept> yeah it makes you move towards enemies when you attack
[0:49:44] <Knifefarty> can you cancel it if it's set to press button?
[0:49:44] <%TopTierHarley> It's definitely not once but ok
[0:49:44] <%Ninestempest> you mash it to get it to go once
[0:49:46] <%MonsterEnvy> Yes that is helpful
[0:49:49] <Knifefarty> just press it again?
[0:49:51] <+Acrylick42> press feels like shit i prefer hold

[0:56:14] <studleydoorite> look at Slowpoke, he's sick
[0:56:18] <+Weeewer> youre in their speed zone
[0:56:19] <%andrewofbob> Squirtle isn't even the roster...
[0:56:20] <Louie_Salmon> Speed flux
[0:56:20] <+Weeewer> which means you move slow
[0:56:22] <%lloyddboy> RAW SEXUAL ENERGY
[0:56:31] <+thefancywig> the fact that they have squirtle in these tutorials while he's not playable is hilarious
[0:56:32] <Zayasu> I'm Trainer 2 :)
[0:56:34] <Louie_Salmon> Slow and they can see you
[0:56:36] <%Puhff> I love that they do a lil slam dunk to core poin
[0:56:39] <DraxTD> Hay pat, how's this Poked-man unite thing?
[0:56:54] <+Weeewer> squirtle shipped out to die
[0:56:59] <+pupil31> They're feeding LOL
[0:56:59] <%MonsterEnvy> squirtle is not even in the game yet
[0:57:05] <%GobbleLynn> @thefancywig they're the next character coming out
[0:57:07] <%BestTeaMaker> squirtle is gonna be added to the roster soon
[0:57:15] <%DukeMoose> @MonsterEnvy WHAT
[0:57:21] <+Weeewer> snorlax is s tier defender
[0:57:24] <SnorlaxBud> the bots are trash, love playing vs them in ranked
[0:57:27] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> Snorlax is the shit
[0:57:28] <+pupil31> SourPls
[0:57:29] <%MonsterEnvy> Yeah he is not playable yet.
[0:57:30] <nailwind> bulbasaur chads where you at
[0:57:33] <+sonofthedeepsouth> murked
[0:57:36] <Louie_Salmon> Snorlax is the second best tank in the game
[0:57:36] <+antpantz> yawn is wayyy too good
[0:57:37] <%CalderGaming> I'm squirtle, dying
[0:57:37] <%notsoy> they really added fucking gardevoir before blastoise, a travesty
[0:57:38] <SnorlaxBud> Snorlax has 2 S tier spots
[0:57:42] <Ardailec> FeelsBadMan Poor Squirtle
[0:57:44] <+Celarious> He's busted early game but he falls off hard
[0:57:44] <+noappedixman> when you gonna open your wallet
[0:57:45] <Profmcstevie> Ears busy reading
[0:57:46] <julrave> Zapados is literally the winning factor in these games, getting it means you win
[0:57:49] <%Snarksmith> Snorlax can hold ALL the Pokemon
[0:57:51] <+CaptainLoin> >zapdos can turn the tide of a battle thats an understatement
[0:57:55] <+BigNerdSam> My favorite Snorlax tech is to put enemies to sleep mid-fight.
[0:58:01] <kylecorr> gengar and zeraora is busted also
[0:58:01] <+redthebaron> tiny bird
[0:58:01] <+pupil31> Stealing Zapdos kills is the funniest shit LUL
[0:58:02] <+Weeewer> Okay Pat this is the most important lesson of all : ZAPDOS is the entire goal of the game
[0:58:03] <%andrewofbob> Slowbro is pretty good with the full CC chain
[0:58:03] <Ardailec> @notsoy of course they added Gardevoir. She's like...80% of the fan art.
[0:58:10] <BackflipCharm> Never surrender a match before Zapdos, folks
[0:58:10] <%tactician0> charizard is also nasty
[0:58:11] <DancesWitBalrog> Pat likes tanks. Tank is Snorlax
[0:58:11] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> DO YOU LOVE KANTO?
[0:58:16] <nailwind> gengar is such a fun faceroll charactcer
[0:58:17] <yaboi_raidshadowlegends> GF LOVES kanto
[0:58:19] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> I lock to block stun people into submission as Snorlax
[0:58:25] <+SinisterBroccoli> There are like no gen 2
[0:58:32] <+Weeewer> Every single goal becomes an instant goal
[0:58:38] <%GigaSeifer> it means you score instantly @PatStaresAt
[0:58:39] <%VictorVonLouche> you INSTANT SCORE
[0:58:40] <%aishman> You score faster
[0:58:40] <+Gouf_Troop> you score more points
[0:58:40] <Snookasaurus> instant
[0:58:41] <%andrewofbob> Defenceless = instant dunk
[0:58:42] <%BestTeaMaker> defenseless means no shield and instant goal
[0:58:42] <%therustystream> no channel time to score
[0:58:42] <InvaderKAZ> You dunk instantly yeah
[0:58:44] <Sarakin2> the scoring charge time is like almost instant yeah
[0:58:44] <+Celarious> Goals become instat
[0:58:46] <+UnfilteredComic> You score instant
[0:58:46] <+TheBobulus> defenseless means instant and double-points
[0:58:50] <Louie_Salmon> Run in and mash, yep
[0:58:50] <+Mr___Pillow> yeah yeah
[0:58:50] <+Weeewer> yeah its an instant win 90% of the time i you get zapdos
[0:58:52] <+pupil31> DUNK
[0:58:54] <tmo200> enemies also do not get a shield/healing from the goal
[0:58:54] <%Treuan> Yeah, otherwise the more points you have the longer the charge
[0:58:55] <SnorlaxBud> get dunked on fellow kids
[0:58:55] <+BigNerdSam> Instant goal, double points
[0:58:57] <2DSuperiority> more point insta goal big good
[0:59:00] <Axl_Frost> @andrewofbob yeah, locking people in Slowbro’s cc makes me almost feel like I’m playing dota 2 again
[0:59:05] <%ShogunNoonto> there is no gen2 here
[0:59:06] <+Mr___Pillow> Zapdos be global Rotam
[0:59:07] <%andrewofbob> Normally, carrying more ass energy makes it take longer to dunk
[0:59:08] <nailwind> TOP IS FED
[0:59:12] <Louie_Salmon> No YOU'RE fed
[0:59:19] <%Puhff> BOT IS FED
[0:59:20] <+Weeewer> @BigNerdSam the double points are because of last 2 min, so not a zapdos thing
[0:59:27] <studleydoorite> i'll feed ur mom
[0:59:29] <illtima> DO YOUR LAST HITS PAT
[0:59:30] <Sarakin2> snorlax loves to be fed
[0:59:34] <+Infernal_Dalek> Fed = big and strong
[0:59:37] <Louie_Salmon> Report enemy team for feeding
[0:59:54] <steelballsdeep> pats tummy wummy is fed to the ugu maximum and will carry us all.
[1:00:09] <%VictorVonLouche> Pat do math
[1:00:09] <+Weeewer> the move sets are surprisingly well thought out
[1:00:18] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> some pokemon take longer to scale so you know youre messing up if you have a charmander already a charizrd in early game
[1:00:24] <+Acrylick42> hold is better
[1:00:25] <%Axellogic> Maybe go back to hold
[1:00:25] <%Deano8817> I prefer hold honestly
[1:00:27] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah gotta go nooch
[1:00:30] <+Yudouuuuuuu> I feel like hold makes more sense
[1:00:42] <%VictorVonLouche> Kill the minion pokemon for more points
[1:00:54] <+Weeewer> hold can be finnicky for me, you can mash tap and get it started
[1:01:01] <+pupil31> The menu's are crap LOL
[1:01:02] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah menus are not good
[1:01:04] <%andrewofbob> Menus run on delay code?
[1:01:11] <%BestTeaMaker> the menus suck
[1:01:14] <+Weeewer> Item Enhancer single most important thing in the game.
[1:01:17] <JORDANdotEXE> theres one more tutorial
[1:01:19] <+Mr___Pillow> items be passives
[1:01:20] <Louie_Salmon> I have no idea why they lag, there really is not a lot going on
[1:01:20] <%BoxNavy> da idums...
[1:01:23] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> i still get lost on these menus because theyre so slow lol
[1:01:32] <Explodincatz> p2w items
[1:01:36] <+Mr___Pillow> battle prep held items to equip
[1:01:37] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> like trying to upgrade my held items
[1:01:40] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:01:43] <Axl_Frost> Speaking of controls: has anybody told Pat that he can have auto-attacks mapped to both A and B, each preferring different targets?
[1:01:46] <+Killsteal_Wolf> That's the pay to win items, you can start levelling them up when you reach Trainer Level 9
[1:01:47] <steelballsdeep> menus are pre weird but are easy to get used to
[1:01:50] <%VictorVonLouche> lol no
[1:01:57] <Louie_Salmon> @axl_frost Yeah, he has it on
[1:01:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> THESE LOAD TIMES
[1:01:57] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Which doesn't take that long at all
[1:01:59] <%emperordread> Become a pikamon master
[1:02:02] <+OddityOn> not yet
[1:02:08] <nailwind> feed that pokemon with your credit card
[1:02:10] <+Weeewer> the menus are laggy so i hate em for that
[1:02:14] <%Treuan> Jungle buffs
[1:02:23] <Louie_Salmon> Get that blue buff
[1:02:23] <BackflipCharm> The game really isn't pay to win. The items are easy to get where you need them without paying money.
[1:02:23] <%chance_h> Gamer time
[1:02:26] <+Weeewer> Dreadnaw is super important btw, huge EXP lead for the team, its like league dragon
[1:02:28] <%Ninestempest> also i love how pat says there is a lot of gen 2 when it's like, just aipom
[1:02:29] <+Dustin_Gunn> they're just making these pokemon up on the fly
[1:02:30] <%andrewofbob> You can use HEAVY SLAM to get away
[1:02:31] <+butterick> pupperPeepin
[1:02:35] <Axl_Frost> @louie_salmon just saw it. Thx, friend.
[1:02:37] <steelballsdeep> Bruh Erbies design is fucking TOP NOTCH

[1:02:43] <%VictorVonLouche> thats the flux zone
[1:02:59] <%JumboCrunchies> Gives you an execute effect
[1:03:10] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah his boosted attack is insane
[1:03:12] <%Spydurman> the purple buff
[1:03:17] <+Weeewer> @noappedixman 100% is pushing it. like you cant infinitely scale cause mony
[1:03:20] <+Das_Prints> That’s not purple.
[1:03:23] <%Movemeister> Ludicolo BibleThump
[1:03:25] <%GigaSeifer> blue = easier last hits, red = slow attacks

[1:05:45] <%Deano8817> HEX SLUDGE BOMB
[1:05:46] <%GigaSeifer> yes there should be crossplay, that's why they mentioned accounts when you logged in

[1:09:27] <+Weeewer> pat you dont understand
[1:09:29] <%goose_attack_almanac> He will NEVER get nerfed
[1:09:30] <VentWilsn> LET THE SLUDGE BOMB FUEL THE DARK SIDE
[1:09:31] <%Deano8817> they didn't nerf him the first update LUL
[1:09:33] <+Weeewer> your level 7 power spike is massive
[1:09:35] <+campfirecrew> wait to you try machamp lol
[1:09:35] <linSP> Children are in shambles

[1:09:42] <%TheYellowcouch> Kill dreadnaw!
[1:09:49] <+Weeewer> Hex resets cooldown if you hit a status'd pokemon
[1:09:49] <%Deano8817> hex is spammable
[1:09:50] <$renyrells> bomb then use hex
[1:09:51] <+sonofthedeepsouth> OP AND BROKEN
[1:09:51] <+Weeewer> AKA poisoned
[1:09:52] <Louie_Salmon> Sludge then Hex is the combo
[1:09:52] <%therustystream> why does the music sound offkey
[1:09:53] <+Acrylick42> he's not gonna know how to use it properly
[1:09:54] <Mogel56> hexing a sludged enemy resets hex's cooldown
[1:09:55] <Daebunz> hit people youi poison with hex
[1:09:55] <+Celarious> Now hit something with sludge bomb then spam hex
[1:09:56] <+sunsetserenity1> Use sludge bomb first, then use hex over and over
[1:09:56] <sponsoredviewer910> sludge then hex
[1:09:56] <+NightNiix> This game actually seems fun
[1:09:57] <OldManDeckardCain> you can use hex on enemies affected by sludge bomb
[1:09:57] <+Dustin_Gunn> @PatStaresAt hex has no cooldown when it hits a poisoned mon
[1:09:58] <Daebunz> resets the cooldown
[1:09:58] <%lumporr> is there a strict role system like how you're not supposed to leave your lane in LoL, or is there more freedom?
[1:09:58] <+RyeReis> sludge bomb first, then just keep spamming hex on them
[1:09:59] <bigshedman> Hex resets duration of status effects
[1:10:04] <+Keiyum> sluge bomb first so hex has no cooldown
[1:10:04] <+Weeewer> Sludge then hex
[1:10:05] <kotl7> Sludge then Hex
[1:10:06] <+Tragosavich> Its a blink
[1:10:06] <%Ninestempest> hex resets when the target is poisoned
[1:10:06] <+OddityOn> Sludge then hex
[1:10:07] <+TheBobulus> wipe eldegoss out fast, they heal their team
[1:10:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Resets cooldown on Statused characters
[1:10:10] <+Tragosavich> Flash thing
[1:10:11] <%GobbleLynn> You need to poison them FIRST
[1:10:13] <%Treuan> It jumps on someone. If you sludge bomb then hex you can hex until they die
[1:10:17] <Daebunz> cooldown resets if you hit someone with a syayis
[1:10:19] <Daebunz> staytus*
[1:10:21] <+OddityOn> you can spam hex after sludge
[1:10:26] <%Deano8817> hex can be spammed on poisoned pokemon basically
[1:10:27] <%CalderGaming> Iron Jaws
[1:10:27] <%marusux> Sludgebomb then use hex
[1:10:27] <%GigaSeifer> if you hit a poisoned dude you can spam it
[1:10:27] <%notsoy> it extends status timers
[1:10:30] <%Monkeyweed21> no cooldown if they have poison
[1:10:35] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> Poison with sludgebomb first, then hex
[1:10:36] <%dredgyboi> Resets debuffs
[1:10:39] <%GigaSeifer> Gengar can legit 100-0 most other characters
[1:10:43] <%TheYellowcouch> Big DPS
[1:10:44] <Zebroneath> that's fuckied
[1:10:45] <%TopTierHarley> 1 second reset
[1:10:46] <+sunsetserenity1> YEYEYEYE
[1:10:46] <+Weeewer> Congrats Pat, youre god now
[1:10:46] <InvaderKAZ> You poison with Sludge Bomb and then Hex gets a cooldown reset when you hit them
[1:10:47] <+RyeReis> that is why he is broken
[1:10:48] <%TubeMan642> He is so busted
[1:10:49] <+campfirecrew> LUL LUL
[1:10:49] <bigshedman> So a status effect has a duration, right? So hex resets that duration.
[1:10:49] <+OddityOn> see
[1:10:49] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Sludgebomb first, then Hex
[1:10:50] <$renyrells> yuuuuup

[1:11:14] <+redthebaron> kinda of insane
[1:11:15] <+OddityOn> Zeraora, Gengar and Lucario are savages

[1:11:17] <$renyrells> NOW YOUR EYES HAVE OPENED
[1:11:18] <sirtommygunn> DUNK
[1:11:21] <%therustystream> this is a good video game lol
[1:11:21] <+Dustin_Gunn> it's legit a huge balance issue
[1:11:22] <+Weeewer> there is SOME counter play, but its really hard
[1:11:24] <+pupil31> The 40 points D:
[1:11:27] <+Weeewer> Press it again
[1:11:29] <%Bailey__gaming> Butt Stomp
[1:11:29] <+RyeReis> you are still squishy though
[1:11:31] <%Deano8817> you need to prress that twice
[1:11:31] <+lordericter> pat use HEX

[1:11:38] <%MrUnKnownAlien> pat i hate how u sit on so many points
[1:11:39] <+Gunnehsan> double activation
[1:11:42] <RamenRiderZ> Someone on the dev team loves Gengar
[1:11:44] <mm_orios> cinderace still more broken tbh
[1:11:45] <Frostydough1> Wait guys is Hex just Kassadin ulti?
[1:11:45] <%TopTierHarley> go cash in
[1:11:45] <VentWilsn> HES SWIMMING
[1:11:47] <+TheBobulus> I think it's like one press to move around, second press to hit 'em
[1:11:48] <+OddityOn> Lucario is a good counter to Zerora but Gengar is a fucking problem
[1:11:51] <+Kaask> slam dunk those points
[1:11:52] <%GobbleLynn> you go invisible when you ult too Pat
[1:11:53] <%shurtal> i just got back, Pat still being toxic?
[1:12:00] <+Das_Prints> You cast it again to do a big attack.
[1:12:01] <Louie_Salmon> @patstaresat Hex has a 1 second cooldown when hitting poisoned pokemon
[1:12:02] <%shurtal> killing the children?
[1:12:04] <kotl7> LUL
[1:12:06] <nailwind> @Frostydough1 hes a fucked up old urgot + kassadin
[1:12:10] <+pupil31> LMAO
[1:12:13] <%Ne1son> Gengar is legitimately cracked in this game
[1:12:14] <+MythosDeity> LMAO
[1:12:17] <+sonofthedeepsouth> PAT DUNK
[1:12:18] <%TheYellowcouch> MELT THE KIDS
[1:12:18] <OldManDeckardCain> we told you LUL
[1:12:19] <DaKnightWarrior> LUL
[1:12:19] <+Weeewer> its the strongest moba character of all time
[1:12:20] <CriticKitten> LUL
[1:12:22] <+Weeewer> like its not even close
[1:12:23] <Zebroneath> That's the worst I've ever seen
[1:12:23] <+Killsteal_Wolf> That's with what, a 1 level difference?
[1:12:23] <%VictorVonLouche> Its gotta get hard nerfed
[1:12:28] <+pupil31> Pika melted
[1:12:31] <WakeUpThrow> Why is this character like this, jesus christ
[1:12:32] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Lol of course hes playing Gangar
[1:12:32] <+OddityOn> Zerora and Gengar will obliterate you
[1:12:32] <+noappedixman> its fihne
[1:12:34] <+Acrylick42> just don't get hit and hex is on cd.
[1:12:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> That is broken
[1:12:36] <%notsoy> cash out your points, you wasted 24
[1:12:37] <%GigaSeifer> once you get the item where you heal when you use an ability, you're invincible
[1:12:37] <+Chosington> clearly not broken enough since you died Kappa
[1:12:38] <$thesickestzak> Now but the items that increase your damage
[1:12:38] <sirtommygunn> that hex cd should be at least 3x as long
[1:12:38] <+Weeewer> Asides from him though, game feels pretty balanced LOL
[1:12:39] <+Acrylick42> gengar is easy to cc and kill
[1:12:42] <$thesickestzak> *buy
[1:12:45] <nailwind> instant rework Kappa
[1:12:46] <%pokefan9956> what if they just didn't nerf him lol
[1:12:46] <%TopTierHarley> Cause he's Gengar
[1:12:46] <+NeroZeppeli> madame95Beans1
[1:12:48] <Baljhet> I don't understand why it isn't like, a 2s reduction instead of "all"
[1:12:50] <%TopTierHarley> he deserves it
[1:12:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHO THOUGHT THAT WAS OKAY
[1:12:55] <DaKnightWarrior> Ghost types number one!
[1:13:04] <%TopTierHarley> Now wait til you see Cinderace auto attack you to death
[1:13:12] <nailwind> corner fucked
[1:13:12] <+Weeewer> the counter play is to dodge sludge bomb, he goes down free if you do. but that shit aint easy
[1:13:13] <VentWilsn> has anyone else who played Unite ever go like 2 days not fighting actual good gengars?
[1:13:15] <+Acrylick42> if he misses hex/sludge bomb he doesn't do anything for like 7 seconds
[1:13:16] <+Weeewer> Or use Full Heal item
[1:13:17] <+pupil31> Gacha
[1:13:21] <Static870> I got Gengar because I like him, turns out he’s super busted. Whoops.
[1:13:21] <Zeemod155> They need to change sludge bomb to something else so that you're required to use other player's pokemon's status effects
[1:13:25] <BackflipCharm> @PatStaresAt Hex also puts your basic attack to the end of the combo so you can boost your DPS by smacking between hexes
[1:13:33] <+OddityOn> man they chose to make Cinderace is annoying as hell
[1:13:36] <kotl7> now do a pentakill
[1:13:41] <VentWilsn> ULT
[1:13:49] <+MythosDeity> hahaha
[1:13:50] <+MoonObscure> LOL
[1:13:52] <+MoonObscure> nice
[1:13:53] <Mattais88> Doomfist alt
[1:13:54] <+Weeewer> WHAT. A . GOAL
[1:13:56] <+Totally_Not_Toby> it's so fucked up
[1:13:56] <%TopTierHarley> WHAT A GOAL
[1:13:59] <WakeUpThrow> Disgusting
[1:14:03] <DaKnightWarrior> YEYEYE
[1:14:05] <%GigaSeifer> now just imagine if you'd been jungling
[1:14:05] <%BestTeaMaker> like, there is counterplay to gengar, but if your team isn't good or isn't coordinating, gengar is a nightmare to fight
[1:14:10] <+pupil31> WHAT A GOAL
[1:14:12] <+TheBobulus> regretting not spending my coins on gengar D:
[1:14:13] <+SinisterBroccoli> How can you tell who's winning?
[1:14:17] <JojoAndTheAfroRobo> rip the talonflame ult
[1:14:18] <%andrewofbob> Did that child just ult a jungle mob?
[1:14:21] <sirtommygunn> ultimate straight into a wall lol
[1:14:24] <+Acrylick42> see how he missed and died
[1:14:24] <DaKnightWarrior> Pat's new main.
[1:14:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> IF you can't combo you die
[1:14:24] <+thefancywig> there isn't one
[1:14:25] <+OddityOn> talonflame is good tho, I love talonflame
[1:14:25] <Baljhet> to be fair, you died because you fucked his mechanics up twice.
[1:14:25] <+kewlmyc> Bodied by choildren
[1:14:26] <+Gunnehsan> just could've kept on hex'n bro
[1:14:26] <+Weeewer> Talonflame is the hero we deserve
[1:14:27] <%Deano8817> there isn't
[1:14:28] <%GigaSeifer> you don't see it until the end
[1:14:29] <%Treuan> There is no scoreboard
[1:14:29] <+thefancywig> all you get is that note about who's in the lead
[1:14:29] <+Weeewer> they do NOT show scores
[1:14:30] <%Ninestempest> NO SCORE LOL
[1:14:30] <%Ne1son> Who needs one
[1:14:31] <quietshun> there isn't one
[1:14:31] <+Totally_Not_Toby> not allowed
[1:14:31] <%BestTeaMaker> There's no score on screen, that's the other annoying part
[1:14:32] <+sunsetserenity1> It's not therw
[1:14:32] <%pokefan9956> there is no score lol
[1:14:32] <Kratok> LUL
[1:14:32] <%TopTierHarley> You don't get to see the score :)
[1:14:33] <%VictorVonLouche> There isnt
[1:14:33] <%Ninestempest> Can press start to see kills
[1:14:34] <+campfirecrew> i dont thinnk they show the score
[1:14:35] <nailwind> he probably assumed the ult goes through the wall
[1:14:35] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Think you hit minus to see it?
[1:14:36] <+Weeewer> Well thats not accurate
[1:14:36] <TheDirtyGentlemen> Oh god that talon flame panicked
[1:14:37] <InvaderKAZ> You can tell by the vibes
[1:14:37] <+Yudouuuuuuu> generally, whoever has more goals up.
[1:14:37] <Kratok> This game sucks Pat
[1:14:37] <+Mr___Pillow> hold X when alived?
[1:14:37] <Baljhet> like Splatoon
[1:14:38] <%GigaSeifer> you get told every couple minutes
[1:14:39] <+thefancywig> that's the only thing
[1:14:41] <quietshun> Sometimes the announcer will say if you have a lead or not
[1:14:41] <+Weeewer> The game tells you whos winning periodically
[1:14:42] <+pupil31> Why tho???
[1:14:44] <+LowBatteryLife> Score is missing to keep people from quitting.
[1:14:44] <sirtommygunn> just a complete surprise who wins at the end
[1:14:44] <+Weeewer> But not quite by how much
[1:14:46] <+Mr___Pillow> X
[1:14:46] <%therustystream> you can kinda tell from destroyed towers
[1:14:46] <%notsoy> ZAPDOS
[1:14:47] <%MrUnKnownAlien> it is a guessing game really
[1:14:49] <%Ninestempest> Yeah every minute or so after 5
[1:14:50] <Profmcstevie> We're REALLY struggling
[1:14:51] <%hewlettfan96> Don’t drink too much Patrick
[1:14:52] <+TheBobulus> I think it's to keep you from giving up when you're only down a little
[1:14:52] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Minus or Plus to see it I think?
[1:14:52] <VentWilsn> only when the game gives u updates like that
[1:14:58] <%BestTeaMaker> Zeraora is also just as busted
[1:14:58] <%Movemeister> I hated talonflame in black/white
[1:14:59] <kylecorr> zeraora is busted also pat
[1:15:03] <+Weeewer> So hex works on ANY status effect, even ones you yourself do not apply
[1:15:04] <TheMadBadger> Yes. That way you don't get people tilted and afking when they see the score
[1:15:04] <%Ninestempest> There's pics of people who have given up but wer ein the point lead lmao
[1:15:04] <$thesickestzak> I think if your push minus you can see the score
[1:15:05] <+NeroZeppeli> I knew Gengar was busted but not THIS busted

[1:33:39] <VentWilsn> HEAVY SLAM
[1:33:40] <+Acrylick42> heavy slam block

[1:33:52] <%PocketBearIllustrator> GIEF!
[1:33:52] <+aSleepySkelly> heavy slam seems better but, you can always try flail once.
[1:33:55] <Drakeotar> Hello everyone, first time on pats stream but loved him for years. Love you Elmo and Gief.
[1:33:55] <%GobbleLynn> Heavy slam is a knockup and CC is so good in this
[1:33:56] <%Zedkan> flail yawn underrated
[1:33:56] <+Weeewer> IF you needed to be a damaging character, you can do flail. Otherwise, Heavy slam is life
[1:33:57] <+tweedler92> bussy gengar
[1:33:59] <GamerWorlock> Heavy is better but Fail good for running
[1:34:02] <%Dakuu75> woof~

[1:36:47] <+OddityOn> Charizard ain't bad, but kinda mid compared to everyone else
[1:36:48] <VirtuaRailith> @thedankestmeeme You have to get to the second main city in the second expansion to become a dark knight
[1:36:50] <%MaxeusTheFirst> @PatStaresAt Those arnt kids they are also other late 30 year olds thinking you are a kid too.
[1:36:53] <%Zedkan> everyone one of venusaurs moves is a skillshot.. hes high risk low reward

[1:37:00] <+OddityOn> his ULT tho will eviscerate you
[1:37:02] <Mattais88> There can be only one!
[1:37:02] <+thatbob9001> @thedankestmeeme I believe Dark Knight is a Heavensward class anyway.
[1:37:10] <%TopTierHarley> Nah Zard is good, you just have to babysit him which is annoying
[1:37:17] <BackflipCharm> Giga drain and petal dance aren't skill shots

[1:37:43] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Pat Sleeps and lets the enemy get away
[1:37:43] <Baljhet> Let him escape while sleeping to send a message
[1:37:46] <Louie_Salmon> BTW you have the free potion
[1:37:47] <+Kiaayo> zard actually got nerfed recently
[1:37:48] <kylecorr> kinda sad the gen 1 starters are kinds bad in this trukBoomer
[1:37:48] <+Acrylick42> 1 hp rest
[1:38:04] <BackflipCharm> Zard is fine just not as good as some of the busted characters
[1:38:09] <gyrobasel> is there itemization in this game like league?

[1:38:12] <VentWilsn> 1HP haunter? I Sleep ResidentSleeper
[1:38:20] <+MythosDeity> 6 second CD for that healing ability seems insanely strong
[1:38:25] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt also the yellow dots on the map are the Creeps use it to look for respawns u need to level yo
[1:38:31] <studleydoorite> what happens if both Gengars try to Hex spam each other at the same time?
[1:38:32] <Baljhet> they're actually kinda coordinated
[1:38:37] <+Gunnehsan> zard is not fine, zard is only assist LUL ]
[1:38:48] <Louie_Salmon> Block is pretty sick
[1:38:55] <chaosjoey> Summoner spells have really low cooldowns in this game when compaired to league
[1:38:59] <+Weeewer> Assists are good, Eldegoss is top tier so idk that doesnt say much
[1:39:02] <%MaxeusTheFirst> I hoped Scyther would have been in the game. I can hope it would be added later maybe.
[1:39:03] <CruxAustralis> SPLAT
[1:39:03] <%Bailey__gaming> BUTT SLAMED
[1:39:03] <bigshedman> Sumo slam!

[1:39:17] <+butterick> fff
[1:39:19] <2DSuperiority> Raboot afk NotLikeThis
[1:39:22] <%Monkeyweed21> CRUSH THE AFK CHILD
[1:39:24] <+Gunnehsan> agoss has utility, zard doesn't

[1:39:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is what I do I sit on you
[1:39:31] <chambatron> afk child
[1:39:33] <%Bailey__gaming> Slam is so fuckin good
[1:39:37] <BackflipCharm> Zard has really high damage on burned targets.
[1:39:47] <+OddityOn> they might forfeit
[1:39:58] <SaltyAzteca> THE WALL
[1:40:00] <TehMud> Kids probably getting told to get off the darn vidyagaems
[1:40:01] <+Soliloquy123> Oh he's Braum
[1:40:05] <Louie_Salmon> Block is incredible in teamfights
[1:40:07] <+lordericter> block seems kinda watery compared to Yawn
[1:40:16] <+Croire> Become as pat, destroyer of children
[1:40:17] <%Bailey__gaming> it's an aoe damage and heal
[1:40:21] <chaosjoey> If you point the wall towards you team you can push enemies into the fight
[1:40:22] <%Zedkan> block can stall zapdos so well
[1:40:22] <+OddityOn> they taking bottom now
[1:40:27] <kylecorr> block can stunlock people
[1:40:29] <Meltgar> Pat, you can roll
[1:40:29] <gyrobasel> wait why are the jungle creeps just other pokemons? LUL
[1:40:29] <+Weeewer> block is INCREDIBLE, its what th high elo dudes use
[1:40:30] <VentWilsn> the only problem i have with zard is that sometimes his seimstic toss doesnt execute even tho im mashing the button
[1:40:36] <+Vigonept> block is fucking amazing
[1:40:42] <CruxAustralis> yeah
[1:40:44] <Baljhet> Gengar almost 1v3'd
[1:40:45] <CruxAustralis> gengar is very strong
[1:40:52] <+Acrylick42> block is probably the best skill in the game
[1:40:54] <+Weeewer> potion
[1:40:55] <Megafang2145> Gengar is Busted rn
[1:40:56] <BackflipCharm> Block is great if you have a team that will take advantage of the opening
[1:40:58] <+Killsteal_Wolf> For a 3v1 scenario, that Gengar did really well, even with a level disadvantage
[1:41:01] <%NitronStreams> potion
[1:41:01] <TheAdMerlin> Gengar must've bought items
[1:41:04] <chambatron> rest
[1:41:06] <SaltyAzteca> NO MAN ON EARTH CAN MAKE IT FALL
[1:41:15] <+Weeewer> LUL
[1:41:15] <%Draylle> we have to clean the boy
[1:41:17] <%Dakuu75> FUCKING WUT
[1:41:17] <Louie_Salmon> You should use potion more often, it costs nothing
[1:41:21] <+pupil31> CHARMANDER I CHOOSE YOU
[1:41:22] <Sarakin2> ew
[1:41:22] <%Bailey__gaming> BUTT SLAMED
[1:41:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> BLASTOISE BEST STARTER
[1:41:24] <Megafang2145> when hex hits a poisoned enemy it shortens the cooldown to basically nothing
[1:41:24] <californaya> WOW, PAT
[1:41:25] <quietshun> The other ones can't learn fly tho

[1:41:52] <%TopTierHarley> Yea take their jungle
[1:41:53] <bob900000> but venasaur sucks
[1:41:59] <%Movemeister> Bulbasaur is the worst gen 1 starter
[1:41:59] <+redthebaron> boring dragon vs plant dinosaur
[1:42:00] <Drakeotar> Dakuu gets it
[1:42:04] <+demon1103> Blastoise > Charizard...yeah I said it
[1:42:04] <%Monkeyweed21> fire starters didnt get good until Blaziken
[1:42:08] <Megafang2145> Venasaur rules
[1:42:14] <%Movemeister> But I’m all for dunking on charizard

[1:45:04] <Saltmeisterr> imaging losing zap and winning
[1:45:06] <+CaptainLoin> free venusaur!
[1:45:07] <%TheYellowcouch> numbers are not important
[1:45:07] <Megafang2145> You are credit to team
[1:45:09] <VentWilsn> was gengar's name "Bussie"?
[1:45:09] <TheMostAverageGamer4> demolsih them all
[1:45:12] <+Arek_1> LUL LUL
[1:45:13] <insomniac_doze_> turn down the music
[1:45:14] <+NiktenKing> Venusaur
[1:45:17] <+Weeewer> try him out!
[1:45:19] <+fetrigon> pat no
[1:45:19] <shotgang86> ...why I don't like that UI?
[1:45:19] <+Weeewer> hes not bad
[1:45:20] <+ikantreeed> if ur character was a real human, i wold refuse to shake his hand
[1:45:20] <kylecorr> they were playing cinderace and he's kinda busted
[1:45:23] <+OddityOn> lowest tier but still fun to play
[1:45:25] <+fetrigon> stop
[1:45:25] <+lordericter> Venesaur is pretty mid
[1:45:25] <%Ninestempest> venusaur is okay but his ult kinda bad
[1:45:26] <Louie_Salmon> He's one of the worst in the game
[1:45:27] <%Ranryu692> so true to life?
[1:45:28] <shotgang86> that... arrow, I don't like it
[1:45:28] <%lumporr> what's the roster like? how's it feelin' variety wise?
[1:45:28] <theanora1> No child left un-demolished
[1:45:28] <+projectmanatees> How you finding the game?
[1:45:29] <%Paperware> Solar Beam is cool though
[1:45:30] <%Ninestempest> solar beam is hilarious though
[1:45:31] <Saltmeisterr> he's kinda weak
[1:45:36] <%Draylle> @VentWilsn that's what i thought i saw LUL
[1:45:37] <+Weeewer> So the held items are the p2w mechanic, sorta
[1:45:39] <+OddityOn> he's not good but he's fun
[1:45:40] <chambatron> I will be downloading this yo my nephew tomorrow. he's 7 please be nice to him
[1:45:45] <+redthebaron> upgrade?
[1:45:46] <%GobbleLynn> Solar Beam is like the only good thing about Venusaur and you should probably be taking Petal Dance for the mobility anyway so
[1:45:49] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Can we do the upgrade pay to win now?
[1:45:52] <Saltmeisterr> muscle band is very good
[1:45:54] <vegetablespy> I guess 100 dollars makes you the best kid crusher
[1:45:55] <%Bailey__gaming> with blue hair
[1:45:56] <+Acrylick42> pretty sure solar beam is like the best spell as far as damage
[1:45:58] <Baljhet> your child will be destroyed by Pat-like manchildren
[1:45:59] <quietshun> Nah you got the hair and hat
[1:46:03] <+Weeewer> LUL
[1:46:05] <+NiktenKing> Muscle Band is busted on Cramorant
[1:46:05] <kylecorr> bad ult and only good move is solar beam since it has alot of range
[1:46:07] <+Kaask> oof
[1:46:07] <%GobbleLynn> it comes with a wig
[1:46:08] <%Ziegsy> wig
[1:46:09] <yourliteraldog> its crustle
[1:46:09] <+OddityOn> cause set
[1:46:10] <%Bailey__gaming> it's a hat with hair
[1:46:10] <%NitronStreams> the hair is attached
[1:46:10] <Louie_Salmon> "Headwear"
[1:46:12] <%king_wragles> Cause it's also hair
[1:46:13] <Sarakin2> set items have specific looks
[1:46:13] <Megafang2145> Venusaur can snipe major objectives (i.e. drednaw and zapdos) but it takes experience
[1:46:16] <+redthebaron> wig
[1:46:21] <%Sotetsu> Hair is attached to the hat.
[1:46:22] <+redyoshi5> you can get machamp now
[1:46:25] <VentWilsn> yea some of the topwear changing hair color
[1:46:26] <+NightNiix> when you buy hats the hair comes with it, everybody knows that

[1:47:14] <+Weeewer> NO
[1:47:14] <+lordericter> you are fucked if you missed week 1
[1:47:14] <%goose_attack_almanac> You're fucked if you do buy it anyway
[1:47:22] <+Iamdenril> nothing worth in that battlepass
[1:47:23] <+Weeewer> You get MORE than enough in the battle pass if you play all the missions
[1:47:24] <+ByakkoHQ> my math has determined that its some bullshit
[1:47:26] <+NiktenKing> are you able to change weeks?
[1:47:26] <+demon1103> a battlepass is fine....as long as it doesn't expire,wasting your $$$
[1:47:27] <+Iamdenril> really
[1:47:29] <Megafang2145> Tip: convert all aeos tickets to item enhancers
[1:47:31] <+Weeewer> YoU ARE NOT fucked
[1:47:31] <+BigNerdSam> SWAGACHU
[1:47:31] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Because of course you can spend money to instantly max out the battle pass level

[1:47:54] <Moondoggie25> @patstaresat its honestly a fairly quick battlepass
[1:47:55] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, it's definitely not GOOD to miss week 1
[1:47:57] <linSP> There’s FOMO?
[1:47:58] <%Bailey__gaming> EGG
[1:48:05] <theanora1> look at the end of the pass, Pat
[1:48:06] <+Mr___Pillow> missions are worth more asx the weeks go potentially, looks fine
[1:48:06] <BeyondTheGrave07> @PatStaresAt You can buy levels though with the premium currency
[1:48:08] <+NiktenKing> The final reward is the best
[1:48:13] <Laioken13> there's always gonna be fomo with these lmao
[1:48:18] <+Killsteal_Wolf> You need to play about 70% of the days in a season I think
[1:48:19] <%GobbleLynn> Yeah you should only spend your Aeos tickets on Item Enhancers, Pat
[1:48:20] <+MeltymcFisto> Pat Sandles are for feet not your asshole, silly
[1:48:21] <+NiktenKing> the last reward is the best

[1:53:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> league
[1:53:56] <%Axellogic> Potato Salas
[1:53:56] <gyrobasel> leek
[1:53:56] <Louie_Salmon> Definitely league
[1:53:56] <wolfen091> lige
[1:53:56] <%MechArch> too much power psaGiefrail
[1:53:56] <+polothegreatest> its a shame league games are 1hr+ long
[1:53:56] <bob900000> pokemon league
[1:53:58] <+pupil31> Someone asked which is more toxic League or Overwatch
[1:54:02] <T_innerYeti> league
[1:54:03] <+NiktenKing> they were doing an unofficial poll
[1:54:03] <DickieWoodsmall_279> so it's league?
[1:54:03] <Coystick> League
[1:54:06] <luftraumm1> question wether league or overwatch more toxic
[1:54:07] <+Nathan246> ligue
[1:54:10] <Explodincatz> Dota1
[1:54:12] <WakeUpThrow> Overwatch is pretty bad too
[1:54:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Overwatch is PRETTY toxic but League is way worse
[1:54:17] <Neri011> You can grab Machamp now
[1:54:17] <%goose_attack_almanac> Overwatch
[1:54:20] <%PocketBearIllustrator> @VentWilsn Well, it's more of a dark black on my end. And there's stars n shit. :P
[1:54:22] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Overwatch and league
[1:54:25] <+WarbossMetal> Which is more toxic? League or Dota2
[1:54:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> Ieam
[1:54:28] <Meltgar> League you get insulted in so many languages like in Dota2
[1:54:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its become HYPER toxic when out of the spotlight
[1:54:31] <+Dracoshroob> ive heard more raciel slurs in league than i do in overwatch
[1:54:33] <Tomschiii> nah, think the joke of the community is overblown
[1:54:33] <WakeUpThrow> But yeah, League is still the "champ" in that
[1:54:35] <+mikesapartment> Machamps are cool
[1:54:35] <%Draylle> oh man is overwatch pretty bad
[1:54:36] <Profmcstevie> Overwatch got pretty bad pretty fast, but League has legacy toxicity
[1:54:36] <%Paperware> @polothegreatest Games are honestly much shorter now a days, especially since most games are surrender by 15
[1:54:40] <vegetablespy> wild rift isn't bad, but it's still bad
[1:54:42] <luftraumm1> league is radioactive
[1:54:43] <+fetrigon> PAT GRAB MACHAMP
[1:54:47] <%Ranryu692> did you just say Vorelax?
[1:54:48] <+ahdurian> not going to grab Gengar?
[1:54:52] <+fetrigon> alright I reminded him
[1:54:52] <+Maleicus> snore is right
[1:54:53] <Megafang2145> more people play league so the concentration of toxicity is higher. among other reasons
[1:54:53] <+Acrylick42> you don't get enough free currency to keep getting characters pick wisely
[1:54:54] <%PocketBearIllustrator> So happy I haven't given Blizzard any of my money recently.
[1:54:57] <%Ranryu692> oh
[1:54:57] <%TheYellowcouch> vorelax
[1:55:01] <Megafang2145> i think
[1:55:04] <%Ranryu692> I'm keeping Vorelax, then
[1:55:05] <+Acrylick42> takes a couple weeks for 1 character
[1:55:05] <KilljoyHexx> You said VoreLax
[1:55:08] <%Ascethetic> i heard vorelax lol
[1:55:08] <VentWilsn> imagine snorlax could vore people like tham kench

[1:55:35] <%Draylle> not really
[1:55:35] <luftraumm1> a bit
[1:55:35] <%PocketBearIllustrator> Yeah, it's pretty loud.
[1:55:35] <+MisterCrimson> Back in 1997 when gen 1 released, I remember a rumor that if you got Snorlax to level 120, he evolved into Warlax.
[1:55:35] <peachy996> Yes.
[1:55:36] <+AFellowDegen> SonicChu?
[1:55:36] <+NiktenKing> it can be loud
[1:55:36] <tanarath> nah

[1:55:38] <+fetrigon> nah
[1:55:38] <Saltmeisterr> ye
[1:55:40] <+Killsteal_Wolf> It's not that memorable, I say that.

[1:55:48] <%andrewofbob> I turned it down, but game boot forgets until I log in
[1:55:48] <%Dakuu75> I would rather hear more you, than this music
[1:55:49] <luftraumm1> it's also very in your face
[1:55:49] <+Killsteal_Wolf> Which is surprising for Pokemon
[1:55:50] <%Axellogic> YeahI hear you perfectly fine
[1:55:50] <SulfurousAcid> yeah you're louder than game still
[1:55:51] <+upandadam> it's like a cruisin usa machine

[1:55:51] <Megafang2145> yeah\
[1:55:52] <%barrakuta371> Maybe a tad on the loud side, but I hear you
[1:55:53] <tanarath> yeah, we can
[1:55:59] <XxbkgamerxX> I bet there's enough bones inside of Snorlax to create a complete skeleton
[1:56:00] <%BoxNavy> we might guys
[1:56:00] <RamenRiderZ> It sounds like stock music
[1:56:03] <+Maleicus> no thanks

[1:57:23] <+polothegreatest> they are taking too long to release wild rift on consoles
[1:57:25] <agustorm123> Hots was good until it died
[1:57:25] <+Acrylick42> op lane

[2:08:40] <+OddityOn> Machamp is A tier pokemon
[2:08:40] <+EdgarLOLZ> Pat frame 1s the grappler
[2:08:41] <yourliteraldog> SUBMISSIVE AND BREEDABLE
[2:08:44] <Louie_Salmon> Basically Machamp cannot be stopped
[2:08:49] <%Paperware> It's Ora Ora
[2:08:51] <+Weeewer> You have to press the unite move twice
[2:08:56] <chaosjoey> he runs in with submission then close combats and ults to kill
[2:09:01] <+Weeewer> If you dont press it twice you dont getora ora
[2:09:09] <%GobbleLynn> I always pick Submission and Cross Chop
[2:09:12] <%Axellogic> Machamps card pose sucks
[2:09:17] <+Brebovr> is this game fun?
[2:09:18] <Louie_Salmon> @patstaresat You can press + to level up and try moves immediately
[2:09:18] <JobbedBone> if they put Kim K in smash, what is his B move
[2:09:26] <californaya> Machamp with the Randy Orton pose

[2:09:41] <+Weeewer> Check out the training settings
[2:09:45] <shotgang86> psaHoldon
[2:09:55] <kylecorr> submission is really good and cross chip also
[2:09:56] <Hoaxfish> "small child punching monkeys"
[2:10:00] <+Weeewer> Practice options
[2:10:04] <+redyoshi5> practice options
[2:10:07] <+Weeewer> wrong menu
[2:10:26] <chambatron> hey chat is type advantage taken into consideration for damage? like fighting > normal
[2:10:37] <%GigaSeifer> @chambatron no
[2:10:40] <%Ninestempest> noo
[2:10:41] <+AugustRei> no type advantage
[2:10:45] <+OddityOn> nah
[2:10:47] <%wujak> you probably want submission
[2:10:47] <%Ninestempest> it's a moba that']d be really busted
[2:10:48] <+AugustRei> that would make this game a nightmare
[2:10:50] <chambatron> thanks
[2:10:57] <+Weeewer> You can also remove cool downs and just spam shit
[2:10:59] <+bunchaghosts> cool
[2:10:59] <tanarath> Try submission
[2:11:05] <RamenRiderZ> oraoraora
[2:11:07] <+Dracoshroob> ya type advantage and not seeing team picks would just break everything
[2:11:11] <+NiktenKing> use it on target dummy
[2:11:13] <%GobbleLynn> Pat you should pick Submission
[2:11:16] <JobbedBone> D: charmanders are too cute to beat up
[2:11:17] <+Weeewer> You might have to restart
[2:11:20] <Louie_Salmon> He is insanely fast and cannot be slowed. No one can escape him
[2:11:25] <chaosjoey> Submission gives huge speed boost then he grapples on the next auto attack
[2:11:30] <+NiktenKing> You have to restart
[2:11:33] <+redyoshi5> its in settings
[2:11:37] <kylecorr> submission and cross chop are really good
[2:11:38] <%Ninestempest> submission literally make shim busted

[2:13:35] <CanonHusbando> It’s a moba where your son don’t matter it’s good
[2:13:36] <+Acrylick42> cross chop
[2:13:37] <%NitronStreams> cross chop
[2:13:38] <+OddityOn> it's as moba as you can get besides the p2w item enhancements
[2:13:40] <+NiktenKing> ye
[2:13:44] <Martianorbit> How many children’s lives has Pat ruined so far?
[2:13:53] <zerointelligence000> Is it only good if you put money in or can you get by by being cheap?

[2:22:51] <hakumaribo> you want op, try gengar.
[2:22:51] <+Keiyum> naw just everyone you've picked so far lol
[2:22:52] <+WarbossMetal> If everyone is overpowered, nobody is!
[2:22:53] <+NiktenKing> They can be
[2:22:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> Nope just Zeraora and Gengar
[2:22:57] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah there's like 8 OP mons
[2:22:58] <GrayFox517> machamp is pretty solid
[2:23:00] <JobbedBone> your bots are sucking LUL
[2:23:01] <%Garthunox> a slowbro with scald
[2:23:03] <zerointelligence000> can you not see your points during a match?
[2:23:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> A good game makes EVERYONE feel overpowered in the right spot
[2:23:05] <%Garthunox> might as well surrender
[2:23:05] <+Weeewer> oh he knows about Gengar
[2:23:07] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:23:09] <Captbutt> @Keiyum that little shit better get nerfed
[2:23:09] <+Acrylick42> it's the level advantage
[2:23:11] <AllenDeadman> brave bird
[2:23:14] <Saltmeisterr> charizard exist
[2:23:16] <%Ninestempest> @HogHoncho it's a weird option i don't use cause i fyou need to move in a direction and sleect a pokemon, it can fuck up your aiming
[2:23:19] <%YakumoYomi> Zeraora, Gengar, and Cinderace seem to be among the top tiers
[2:23:22] <Saltmeisterr> charizard is bottom tier
[2:23:28] <%Deft_Thought> This music sure is... not great
[2:23:28] <GrayFox517> these are also beginner noobs
[2:23:32] <VentWilsn> zeraora, gengar, lucario, nine tails, maybe gardevoir from what I've played
[2:23:32] <%goose_attack_almanac> He mighta tried to ult you, but You can't be cc'd when you're chasing using submission
[2:23:35] <%Ninestempest> everyone listing these top tiers and not saying machamp is hilarious
[2:23:36] <Captbutt> that's canon
[2:23:38] <CanonHusbando> charizard should always be bottom tier
[2:23:42] <Zeemod155> Pika on Pika violence!!!
[2:23:45] <+Acrylick42> this is all bots
[2:23:45] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @zerointelligence000 Nope, but the game occasionally gives "we're in the lead" "we
[2:23:47] <JobbedBone> BibleThump pokemon the movie vibes
[2:23:51] <Sigma_190_Beta> Pretty sure you can solo Rotom.
[2:23:53] <+redyoshi5> that move was supposed to push you but you are cc immune during submission
[2:23:55] <%Deft_Thought> What about Pikachu on Pikachu violence, hmm???
[2:23:57] <OpenYourEels4TheNextFeels> @zerointelligence000 are behind messages
[2:23:58] <Saltmeisterr> @VentWilsn slowbro too
[2:23:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> its a Pika eat Pika World
[2:24:01] <+NiktenKing> Gengar is only broken if you let him be,idk why people complain. just shut Gengar down early and you are fine.
[2:24:03] <quietshun> Cinderace just kills you with auto attacks, it sucks to fight
[2:24:08] <%bread_assassin> @YakumoYomi I saw MoistCr1tikal play a bit of Cinderace, and yeah, he seems busted.
[2:24:11] <Captbutt> he just let that pikachu live
[2:24:12] <%saiyanblitz> Pokémon shouldn’t be fighting not like this
[2:24:15] <AllenDeadman> monkaS
[2:24:19] <%Movemeister> Pokemon weren’t meant to fight, not like this BibleThump
[2:24:21] <%Garthunox> MAGIC PIXEL!
[2:24:22] <linSP> Yeah! fist those Pokémon
[2:24:23] <%hraezlyrnoyaiba> Magic pixil
[2:24:30] <peachy996> Pokemon should always fight
[2:24:31] <+Keiyum> look how happy the pokemon are
[2:24:32] <peachy996> To the death
[2:24:32] <VentWilsn> @VentWilsn yea i mean he usually never died when i 1v1 him
[2:24:38] <+NiktenKing> Cramorant is truly busted. Free auto attacks on multiple people is dumb
[2:24:43] <Martianorbit> Not even close baybee.
[2:24:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> Kill the Rotom
[2:24:44] <AllenDeadman> nice brave bird LUL
[2:24:46] <fazoburquina> good job talonflame LUL
[2:24:46] <+gerunding> what's the point of having multiple pokeballs if you can't throw them all out at once
[2:24:46] <Louie_Salmon> Bad talonflames are the worst
[2:24:51] <%HaroldDonchee> Holy shit report this talonflame
[2:24:55] <peachy996> Mortal Kombat but with Pokemon
[2:24:58] <Explodincatz> smart bot
[2:25:00] <AllenDeadman> oh Rotom is the herald
[2:25:07] <%GobbleLynn> Oh also after you suplex you get an attack speed buff too
[2:25:14] <+Weeewer> That talon flame didnt stop you?
[2:25:15] <Kalcom> oh wow it's like hots mercs
[2:25:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> Reminder that Machamps pokedex entry says it can crush entire mountains
[2:25:20] <Captbutt> wtf is the other team even doing
[2:25:21] <+Weeewer> Not sure if these are or arent bots at tis point
[2:25:26] <%lloyddboy> pat you shoulda waited for rotom
[2:25:28] <+Acrylick42> cross chop ups your crit too
[2:25:33] <%lloyddboy> it doublesyour points
[2:25:35] <s1rcuit> reminds me of that terminal montage vid where the machamp in Arnold's voice goes: "It's showtime!"
[2:25:35] <VentWilsn> talonflame: "i didnt see anything"
[2:25:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> Kill Zapdos.
[2:25:36] <$thesickestzak> Lol talonflame didn’t even bother
[2:25:37] <AllenDeadman> crushing it
[2:25:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> Head to Central
[2:25:44] <JobbedBone> children are basically bots anyways
[2:25:44] <fatcrab_kurl> A bot would have interrupted him i think lol
[2:25:48] <CanonHusbando> just let you score what a coward
[2:26:03] <CanonHusbando> i'm predicting a surrender
[2:26:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> not really
[2:26:06] <Explodincatz> oh the dunk time is dependent on the amount u have
[2:26:08] <%Paperware> Crustle is pretty fun too, you can trap enemies with a rock wall and wail on them
[2:26:12] <%Garthunox> At risk of feeding his ego, Pat is hard carrying
[2:26:12] <%HotSauceFiend> Is Pat the.... main damage dealer? not sure what lol roles are
[2:26:23] <Louie_Salmon> These are absolutely bots, randos never fight zapdos together
[2:26:24] <+Weeewer> just go dunk dont let em stop you
[2:26:26] <+NiktenKing> one of them has 69 in their name so not a bot
[2:26:28] <+gerunding> not after beating zapdos, iirc
[2:26:33] <VentWilsn> omg i forgot about the giant fucking bruiser known as Crustle
[2:26:38] <+Weeewer> @Louie_Salmon sure they do?

[2:30:10] <CanonHusbando> kids
[2:30:11] <$HogHoncho> children
[2:30:11] <JobbedBone> does this have gambling?
[2:30:12] <%Axellogic> 2 of them had 0 points pat
[2:30:12] <+LowBatteryLife> 2 off them were afk so probably children
[2:30:18] <+Acrylick42> first match is bots
[2:30:22] <+NiktenKing> Real people cause they had a 69 joke as a name
[2:30:22] <+Weeewer> Bots surrender generally though
[2:30:24] <goose_coward> robo-children
[2:30:25] <+Weeewer> I think it was children
[2:30:27] <XxbkgamerxX> Children bots

[2:30:37] <%andrewofbob> PRESS X
[2:30:41] <+MythosDeity> They gonna learn today
[2:30:42] <+Weeewer> X lets you open up a second menu @PatStaresAt

[2:30:44] <$HogHoncho> yeah its the worst thing
[2:30:45] <%viewtifulr> so pat when will start opening card packs Kappa
[2:30:45] <VentWilsn> i love that chat cant tell whether its bots or children
[2:30:49] <Neri011> what happened last round? i missed it
[2:30:50] <+AugustRei> press x
[2:30:52] <VentWilsn> neither could i lmao
[2:30:52] <%NouveauPunk> This game's UX is godawful. It's slow and cumbersome and you need to go through a hundred menus.
[2:30:56] <%YakumoYomi> Bots surrender as soon as the team is down by 300
[2:30:57] <+Weeewer> idk
[2:30:57] <Zebroneath> summer work? what losers
[2:30:59] <$HogHoncho> thats a game changer!
[2:31:00] <+Weeewer> but it is what it is lol
[2:31:04] <%Treuan> It's bugged for pro controllers though
[2:31:04] <CosmicApe13> pat bein a school yard bully givin wedgies and stealing lunch money
[2:31:10] <LorcaNomad> terrible UI design this game gas
[2:31:18] <VentWilsn> oh Crustle
[2:31:18] <kylecorr> there's zeraora
[2:31:19] <%NouveauPunk> You got swimsuit Venusaur!
[2:31:22] <bigshedman> You got Garchomp tho! PogChamp
[2:31:25] <Sigma_190_Beta> Yeah, but you do have a Zeraora on their team.
[2:31:28] <%king_wragles> So this on PC?
[2:31:29] <$jacob2pop> This game could really benefit from a draft pick mode
[2:31:29] <+Weeewer> Menus are easily low point of this game
[2:31:31] <%Axellogic> You got lightning cat to deal with
[2:31:33] <Zeikier> pat u monster
[2:31:33] <%livlinn> psaPorgmo
[2:31:35] <%Treuan> If you hit X to bring up the menu it will lock the game. You can hit - to get out of it
[2:31:36] <+Weeewer> Garchomp is a super late game scaler
[2:31:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Garchomp is fucking cool
[2:31:37] <bigshedman> idk but he's fucking cool lol
[2:31:38] <%HaroldDonchee> that nerd has a skin
[2:31:39] <+Weeewer> but is ASS early
[2:31:40] <quietshun> Garchomp sucks until level 11
[2:31:41] <JobbedBone> pat skateboaring into the schoolyard to make fun of literal children
[2:31:41] <+sunsetserenity1> They have Zeraora NotLikeThis
[2:31:41] <Zeikier> IS garchomp good pchSip
[2:31:43] <CanonHusbando> I love the switch, it's such a functional console
[2:31:44] <$HogHoncho> garchomp is one of my favorite
[2:31:46] <+redyoshi5> garchomp is good late game but sucks till then
[2:31:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> Garchomp can probably solo a bunch of Jungles right?
[2:31:46] <+NiktenKing> Be careful with Crustle
[2:31:51] <+GFPPM> Garchomp can 1 vs 4
[2:31:51] <+MisterCrimson> Garchomps alright, his passive is reflected damage
[2:31:52] <apropos0fnothing> garchomp is useless early
[2:31:53] <%Garthunox> Garchomp is good but his ult is hard to control, cos its outrage
[2:31:58] <boredpantz> Garchomp is pretty good but not as good as your mom's credit card @PatStaresAt
[2:31:59] <+TestAnon> when they going to add shuckle to this game?
[2:32:00] <GrayFox517> hes good but not op
[2:32:01] <+Weeewer> Dont Fuckle with Crustle
[2:32:12] <+NiktenKing> Crustle will take you to ground pound town
[2:32:12] <%YakumoYomi> @king_wragles It's a Pokemon game, so no. It's Switch only for now, with a mobile version coming later.
[2:32:24] <JobbedBone> BibleThump the sacrificial aipoms
[2:32:24] <quietshun> I hope that crustle is good
[2:32:30] <+LowBatteryLife> feed that garchomp pat
[2:32:43] <Neri011> its so adorable
[2:32:43] <goose_coward> punch buddies
[2:32:44] <Sigma_190_Beta> @quietshun He's apparently real good.
[2:32:46] <+NiktenKing> Dont feed the Crustle at all
[2:32:46] <$jacob2pop> Why is the actual game music not the rock track
[2:32:58] <+katsuya01> Oh no. Gible gonna be so useless till gabite
[2:33:05] <JobbedBone> D: THERES AN ICE VULPIX?
[2:33:07] <%Axellogic> I actually kind of dig how the creep being junglies decentralizes the combat alot
[2:33:11] <Zeikier> "I oughta kick yer ass!" ~Jigglypuff
[2:33:21] <+CursedNobleman> @JobbedBone from pokemon sun and moon, from hawaii
[2:33:23] <quietshun> @quietshun Oh I know crustle is good, I meant the player on the other team
[2:33:27] <PartyFavors> @JobbedBone yeah, introduced in gen 7, the Pokemon Hawaii games
[2:33:29] <+Weeewer> I can understand hiding the score, MOBAs are THE most toxic games
[2:33:31] <$HogHoncho> do the evolutions actually change anything? or are they just cosmetic ?
[2:33:31] <JobbedBone> thats pretty cute
[2:33:32] <goose_coward> yummy tears
[2:33:35] <Profmcstevie> Judging by every MOBA ever, adults cry the most
[2:33:35] <+Weeewer> So they hide it so you keep trying
[2:33:35] <chaosjoey> You can kinda predict the score by how many goals are borken
[2:33:36] <Megafang2145> @JobbedBone yeah alolan-vulpix is a subspecies
[2:33:46] <SomeAsianDood> Crustle looks like he knows how to play
[2:33:47] <CanonHusbando> lead is 50 up and huge lead is 100 up
[2:33:48] <%NitronStreams> they hide the score but then they put in messages saying how bad you getting your ass kicked
[2:33:50] <+Weeewer> @HogHoncho they do, but i dont have hard numbers
[2:33:50] <%killer_squid1990> it makes a noise
[2:33:53] <%Ziegsy> pat try a quick match
[2:33:56] <%HaroldDonchee> its for the kids
[2:33:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Are you mad at Jigglypuff because that is what you'd be if you were a pokemon?
[2:33:57] <+WarbossMetal> There is a little sound effect tho
[2:33:57] <+Weeewer> There is a sound effect, its the pokemon sound effect
[2:33:59] <%Sotetsu> You don't die, you faint
[2:34:01] <s1rcuit> @JobbedBone yeah, in Sun and Moon which take place in not-hawaii, there's variants of some pokemon
[2:34:03] <+Flarepulse> Just a "bweoop"
[2:34:03] <+NiktenKing> it makes the death boop
[2:34:03] <JobbedBone> it makes the faint sound
[2:34:04] <+redyoshi5> yes pikachu has a death sound effect no one else
[2:34:06] <VentWilsn> theres a "health at 0" sound effect
[2:34:09] <+Acrylick42> they don't show deaths either.
[2:34:09] <%Extrallent> There's a pokeball recall noise. but it's pretty quiet
[2:34:11] <%andrewofbob> Audio feedback is generally lacking
[2:34:15] <$HogHoncho> @HogHoncho so like general stat buffs
[2:34:18] <%Maids4lyfe> because death's cold sweet embrace is silent
[2:34:20] <linSP> that’s the faint sound effect it go boop
[2:34:20] <%Garthunox> ya too close mon
[2:34:29] <+mitzieter> is pat doing the pay to win in this game?
[2:34:32] <JobbedBone> give us chatPls
[2:34:38] <HoldBtoRun> you're probably too far from the tv to hear it?
[2:34:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pokemon Not Britian also has Poke varients
[2:34:42] <+NiktenKing> Yeah it goes BWOOP
[2:34:49] <bigshedman> why Pat
[2:34:52] <+Weeewer> Pat hasnt spent anything, you dont really need to
[2:35:00] <Megafang2145> theres a bwoop but its faint
[2:35:01] <%Axellogic> Commiting suicide is typically a bad call yes
[2:35:13] <VentWilsn> @NiktenKing yea thats the noise, i couldnt describe it
[2:35:15] <JobbedBone> hes learning BibleThump
[2:35:27] <goose_coward> real tough children
[2:35:28] <+Weeewer> You can hold L and look around the map btw, a lot of people dont realize that
[2:35:33] <+Weeewer> Gardevois HURTS
[2:35:35] <%lloyddboy> pat stop getting fucked
[2:35:36] <%HaroldDonchee> this ninetales is fucking you up
[2:35:38] <$LightningLynx89> Machoke is fed
[2:35:39] <+MisterCrimson> poison is a problem in this game
[2:35:41] <+Acrylick42> getting owned by ninetails
[2:35:43] <Megafang2145> oh good the ninetales picked blizzard
[2:35:43] <VentWilsn> omg ur partner at bot is not pulling his weight
[2:35:46] <hairtoday> is pat feeding?
[2:35:49] <+NiktenKing> It's like a Megaman sound effect for the recall
[2:35:49] <%Spydurman> feeding bot
[2:35:51] <PartyFavors> Ninetales and Gardevoir are shredding and I'm here for it because I love them
[2:35:53] <zerointelligence000> these must be middle schoolers
[2:35:54] <SomeAsianDood> pat can't body children anymore LUL
[2:35:55] <%Ipsenscastle> Machamp seems worse than Vorelax was
[2:35:56] <+NiktenKing> when you die
[2:35:58] <%Bt_Robot> maybe don't feed the Ninetales
[2:35:58] <+Weeewer> Sick

[2:36:03] <+Weeewer> Quick score
[2:36:06] <goose_coward> these are the cool kids
[2:36:11] <LorcaNomad> POPPING OFF
[2:36:13] <+Acrylick42> socore
[2:36:13] <+Weeewer> youre maxed up on balls
[2:36:15] <%andrewofbob> Slows are generally a good way to screw over a melee kit
[2:36:18] <fugly_nick> What the shit is this?
[2:36:18] <+WarbossMetal> ff 15, jungle diff
[2:36:19] <VentWilsn> rip
[2:36:23] <+Weeewer> you have very little time to score, so you have to be really proactive
[2:36:26] <%vitoxxi> are blazeken and lucario in this?
[2:36:27] <+LowBatteryLife> The turnaround is your partner on bot evolved.
[2:36:28] <%TopTierHarley> Maxed out
[2:36:30] <+Acrylick42> people return to lane quick
[2:36:36] <+Weeewer> @vitoxxi lucarios yes

[2:45:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> For a Kid that is big money
[2:45:10] <%Ninestempest> the shitty part is getting an item past level 20 lmao
[2:45:12] <%king_wragles> You know what's cheap? Not actually spending money!
[2:45:12] <pacibuddy> skins are expensive though i think

[2:46:33] <Coystick> Is Machamp supposed to be based on some wrestler or yokai or something?
[2:46:35] <+MythosDeity> This is super duper abusable
[2:46:45] <DianaTheAscian> what a weird system
[2:46:58] <Aydarkzero> wow
[2:46:59] <+Weeewer> AKA dont be a shit-system
[2:47:00] <%Nekros4442> Get fucked
[2:47:02] <%TopTierHarley> Don't be a shit
[2:47:02] <charrchord> ew
[2:47:03] <Neri011> wow
[2:47:03] <+Weeewer> They need to do this in fighting games
[2:47:05] <+NiktenKing> Jail system
[2:47:06] <%NitronStreams> holy shit
[2:47:07] <Aydarkzero> so if you go into the 60's you're fucked
[2:47:07] <chaosjoey> so you can afk 2-3 times a day free
[2:47:09] <goose_coward> toxicity is baked in
[2:47:11] <%Nekros4442> You gave that guy -15 points didnt you
[2:47:12] <+NiktenKing> JAIL JAIL JAIL
[2:47:12] <oedocontroller> what is this jojo reference? "stands still maliciously"?
[2:47:12] <+SilverDevilfish> This system seems abusable
[2:47:16] <+WarbossMetal> Yes it does
[2:47:16] <TheGammaBear> So people can report you falsely and fuck up your entire game
[2:47:16] <Profmcstevie> Trust takes time to build and is easy to annihilate
[2:47:17] <+Iamdenril> i lost 10 for having to leave a game early
[2:47:17] <tmvct1> just dont leave game nerds
[2:47:19] <%TopTierHarley> Yes :)
[2:47:20] <%Dakuu75> yeah
[2:47:20] <artificiallynatural> go to baby jail
[2:47:22] <Explodincatz> jail as a job
[2:47:23] <+AmericanSkidd> probably
[2:47:24] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt its the baby jail system
[2:47:25] <+MythosDeity> Yes. Exactly that
[2:47:25] <%Monkeyweed21> yes
[2:47:26] <%killer_squid1990> I imagine it checks
[2:47:26] <goose_coward> fuck
[2:47:26] <%Ranryu692> maybe it only takes max 10 per match?
[2:47:26] <%andrewofbob> I think AFKing is only reportable
[2:47:26] <Neri011> pretty much
[2:47:26] <%Maids4lyfe> anti-toxic system
[2:47:27] <%Ninestempest> no
[2:47:30] <+Weeewer> Nah, they probably check to see if you were actually idling
[2:47:31] <+NiktenKing> no
[2:47:31] <%Ninestempest> it will only do it per game
[2:47:32] <%Maids4lyfe> oh shit
[2:47:32] <%Agami23> this is the strongest form of stream sniping
[2:47:32] <%killer_squid1990> using an algorithm
[2:47:32] <jorniev> wow
[2:47:33] <%Maids4lyfe> wow
[2:47:33] <DianaTheAscian> Yes
[2:47:36] <%Ninestempest> reports can just confirm
[2:47:36] <+Acrylick42> im sure they only get penalized once
[2:47:37] <goose_coward> time-out system
[2:47:37] <tolloponik> man if league had that bronze might be manageable
[2:47:37] <+NiktenKing> 10 for the match
[2:47:38] <quietshun> How would they do that
[2:47:38] <%The_Protagonist> no actually the system auto-determines it
[2:47:39] <+Weeewer> everyone saying yes has never seen it happen
[2:47:41] <+Weeewer> so...
[2:47:41] <Profmcstevie> Depends if it checks if they were ACTUALLY idling
[2:47:42] <%YakumoYomi> I think the game knows when you idle for a long time
[2:47:42] <+Vigonept> nah
[2:47:45] <%Ninestempest> it's max 10 per game
[2:47:47] <KDE_Viz> what stops fake reports?
[2:47:48] <goose_coward> tantrum corner
[2:47:48] <chaosjoey> They probably have programs to detect idle
[2:47:48] <%Sol_Install> What if they troll on someone?
[2:47:48] <+silvery_cricket> This music sounds like its trying to kill itself
[2:47:50] <hairtoday> the shitty menuing is the only defense against the abuse
[2:47:52] <jorniev> YEAH GENGAR
[2:47:55] <+Weeewer> its auto determined
[2:47:55] <%Bt_Robot> So it takes 12 days to go from 0 to 60
[2:47:56] <%Ninestempest> reporting multiple times doesn't make it happen multiple times
[2:47:56] <%Sol_Install> yea
[2:47:57] <fatcrab_kurl> You have to actually afk
[2:47:58] <+WarbossMetal> Abusable report systems are really bad
[2:47:58] <tranquilturnip> how would they make you suffer the penalty and not them
[2:47:58] <Aydarkzero> hope the team behind this is actually looking into the reports right? Kappa
[2:47:58] <jorniev> AND SNORLAX
[2:48:00] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt you can also report opponents it seems
[2:48:03] <%Sol_Install> that my concern
[2:48:05] <%lloyddboy> I'm guessing it checks inputs over time?
[2:48:07] <%Ninestempest> and yeah it's automatically determined, reports just confirm it
[2:48:08] <%CollinsOfBodom> nintendo just comes and kills you
[2:48:08] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt even if everyone reports it maxes out at -10
[2:48:11] <jerobees> 100% gengar win rate
[2:48:14] <%The_Protagonist> reporting doesn't do shit unless you have like a sex name or something
[2:48:23] <Aydarkzero> is this the season pass?
[2:48:28] <Aydarkzero> oh
[2:48:31] <KDE_Viz> itai
[2:48:32] <%Monkeyweed21> someone else reported that guy too so he got -10 instead of -8
[2:48:33] <oedocontroller> where is "report the entire enemy team" button
[2:48:39] <+NiktenKing> Yes
[2:48:39] <+MythosDeity> Also enjoy not being able to play ranked if you're a well known streamer that gets stream sniped
[2:48:41] <%TopTierHarley> Lol
[2:48:43] <%andrewofbob> 00:00 UTC
[2:48:44] <tranquilturnip> does anyone know how much money it would cost to max out the items to be competitive?
[2:48:44] <goose_coward> bedtime
[2:48:45] <%CubicPhantom> it feels like that system is heavily implementation-dependent
[2:48:46] <%Ninestempest> yeah lol
[2:48:46] <chaosjoey> yup
[2:48:48] <%Ziegsy> china time
[2:48:48] <+NiktenKing> Get your Ninetaled
[2:48:48] <%Ninestempest> it's very china time
[2:48:51] <+Weeewer> what time is that in china tho
[2:48:52] <+Pharmakokinetic> Warframe's refresh is the same, always struck me as odd
[2:48:55] <+silvery_cricket> japanese time
[2:48:58] <%Ranryu692> DBZ Dokkan Battle's is at like 9:30pm
[2:49:01] <+NiktenKing> Get your free Ninetales
[2:49:03] <+Iamdenril> it resets at midnight in the uk
[2:49:03] <CanonHusbando> Pat already strategizing his malicious reports
[2:49:04] <%Ninestempest> oh yeah if you're still on in 10 minutes you can get a free ninetails
[2:49:06] <Aydarkzero> it's indeed Pokemon
[2:49:13] <Neri011> we need more! one day
[2:49:13] <kylecorr> 12am utc
[2:49:15] <%Sotetsu> It was fun to watch
[2:49:16] <+silvery_cricket> That music is not great
[2:49:18] <tmvct1> did you have fun?
[2:49:24] <+Mr___Pillow> 5PM PT is common for ftp games
[2:49:24] <%Teintstein> yet
[2:49:28] <Aydarkzero> i'll pass b/c it's a moba
[2:49:29] <@StridentSong> 8pm EST is Midnight UTC, it's commonly used for games with daily bonuses to use a neutral time
[2:49:32] <theanora1> do you think Plague will report you?
[2:49:34] <%TopTierHarley> the item difference isn't that much
[2:49:36] <tmvct1> nice
[2:49:36] <+72grahamcrackers> resets at
[2:49:40] <%MidnightBurst12> infinite value
[2:49:41] <%TopTierHarley> 2% more damage
[2:49:43] <+72grahamcrackers> 8, literally a couple min
[2:49:46] <CanonHusbando> low APM moba good
[2:49:47] <+NiktenKing> Positive because stream rev
[2:49:49] <Aydarkzero> sounds like something he'd do
[2:49:51] <+silvery_cricket> Apparently Riot is also getting sued by California
[2:49:58] <blue2red> pedNote pedRain free
[2:50:08] <+Mr___Pillow> awesome
[2:50:08] <+72grahamcrackers> @TopTierHarley This, it's barely any increase for paying
[2:50:08] <+Weeewer> they can get to level 30
[2:50:09] <chaosjoey> Its hard to tell because they don't show base stats
[2:50:12] <VentWilsn> @silvery_cricket for what?
[2:50:15] <zzNamttamzz> It's big early game
[2:50:18] <+Weeewer> 1-20 is pretty trivial but 21-30 is more resources
[2:50:20] <kotl7> sick bagel shirt
[2:50:22] <+Killsteal_Wolf> About 10% boosts to a specified stat per item
[2:50:25] <%mike2hands> !uptime
[2:50:25] <@Moobot> @mike2hands I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 50m.
[2:50:25] <+NiktenKing> Lv 30 but honestly 15 is decent
[2:50:26] <%TopTierHarley> Exactly it's barely an increase
[2:50:30] <%TopTierHarley> just whaling to whale
[2:50:31] <+Mr___Pillow> they do when upgrading at trainer lvl 8
[2:50:32] <+Vigonept> its like 2 percent per level
[2:50:35] <VentWilsn> i like X Attack because it makes playing charizard managable
[2:50:37] <+silvery_cricket> @VentWilsn Its been a ongoing thing
[2:50:38] <+Acrylick42> you want items at level 20
[2:50:39] <$thesickestzak> I think someone broke it down in a Reddit post
[2:50:41] <%mike2hands> Did i missed it? :(
[2:50:41] <boredpantz> They can get to level 30, and its super strong early game, especially with the movement speed item in a moba
[2:50:43] <+Mr___Pillow> only shows stats when upgrading
[2:50:45] <+NiktenKing> Dont max out a single item. Make use of multiple ite
[2:50:46] <%TopTierHarley> 15 is decent, 20 is perfect
[2:50:54] <%AzureGale> nyannMegalul
[2:50:54] <%FacetiousAF> BRO ITS THE FUCKIN THE DS3 POG

[2:51:03] <+Breedofevil> gief noises be like
[2:51:06] <+NiktenKing> 15 for all three items. Don't focus just one
[2:51:09] <CanonHusbando> or just spend 40 bux and max out every item
[2:51:11] <Megafang2145> honestly i just got out of great rank and the P2W doesn't seem too noticeable. so either A.) it's not noticable or B.) I'm blind
[2:51:12] <+BigNerdSam> So Pat, how's marrying a cartoon fox waifu?
[2:51:12] <Aydarkzero> oh she's streaming next?

[2:51:59] <+pupil31> Pokemon Saturdays PogChamp
[2:52:00] <%FacetiousAF> @Breedofevil honestly PC, content has dried up other than events
[2:52:06] <+72grahamcrackers> Exactly, playing free will get you to a competitive level. The pay to win mechanic will almost never let you beat someone better, but it is dumb that it's available in the first place.
[2:52:08] <blue2red> pedRat
[2:52:16] <%MistyMntns> Wait is the game free?
[2:52:23] <IronRilla> getting your items to 20 is what you want and you can get that from just playing
[2:52:27] <+NiktenKing> Yes
[2:52:28] <%Ziegsy> iwould like to pokemans with the the sphere

[2:53:07] <%Ranryu692> almost every game type is better with a controller
[2:53:07] <%MistyMntns> @PatStaresAt You should try Smite
[2:53:08] <CanonHusbando> remember awesomenauts
[2:53:17] <%MistyMntns> Wow Okay

[2:54:08] <zzNamttamzz> Remember the Guardians of Middle-Earth LUL
[2:54:09] <%BoxNavy> i cant play dragoon for shit
[2:54:11] <%Agami23> dragoon, warrior, whitemage
[2:54:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> Or PAL
[2:54:16] <+ByakkoHQ> these are great recommendations per role

[2:54:19] <%Agami23> the easiest shit
[2:54:21] <2Bs_USB_port> black mage Kappa
[2:54:21] <$StrawberryPantsu> PAL is brain dead
[2:54:24] <CanonHusbando> if you wanna heal, get ready to get mad
[2:54:32] <%MistyMntns> Jo Cat has guides to FF14
[2:54:35] <%Mountaindrewdle> Dragoon is easy until level 60
[2:54:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> I chose PUG/MNK
[2:54:39] <%BoxNavy> paladin doesnt exist
[2:54:45] <%Agami23> do hall of the novice
[2:54:49] <ExpressNode> Show them the power of adult money
[2:54:51] <%Mountaindrewdle> then it gets easy again at 74
[2:54:51] <+Iamdenril> it has a ranked
[2:54:52] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> heared Destiny 2 is getting crossplay?
[2:54:54] <CanonHusbando> there are plenty of dungeons you'll learn to tank before you need to learn to tank
[2:54:55] <CaptainMuscles> there is a ranked mode.
[2:54:55] <nocturnPhoenix> lol get rolled, Paladin
[2:55:05] <Megafang2145> it has ranked
[2:55:06] <+NiktenKing> Expert class and higher is where the game really starts
[2:55:08] <+Iamdenril> there is a ranked mode
[2:55:11] <+Breedofevil> pat i wanna get into the story of ff14 but ive skippped a few cutscenes cause of dungeon anxiety. WAT DO
[2:55:12] <Aydarkzero> ha
[2:55:13] <+Hilleltaco> Dark knight after getting to Heavensward, worth mentioning. The jobs added in Heavensward are the only ones with mandatory progress like that
[2:55:15] <zzNamttamzz> So many kids don't know what a minimap is
[2:55:15] <Omiba98> there is ranked mode
[2:55:19] <Zeikier> does that make u feel like a big man, pat?
[2:55:22] <Megafang2145> just got into expert
[2:55:22] <+TurnipKupo> im veteran class 3 and genuinely sometimes am matched with people that seem completely new though
[2:55:25] <DianaTheAscian> for sure
[2:55:28] <Profmcstevie> It's not like the game gracefully brings them in to how to play a MOBA
[2:55:30] <oedocontroller> its lol ptsd veterans vs kindergarden
[2:55:34] <Megafang2145> yeah
[2:55:40] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib good musics
[2:55:47] <%Ninestempest> @TurnipKupo fun fact! This game can accidentally put NORMAL GAME PEOPLE in your match!
[2:55:48] <CanonHusbando> @Breedofevil cutscene viewer in your room works wonders
[2:55:53] <%BoxNavy> 3 on ds is good
[2:55:57] <ExpressNode> Well its not definitive because they remove shit from the GBA releases
[2:55:59] <%Ninestempest> It's the shitttiest matchmaking ever
[2:56:00] <%Ranryu692> 2 fucking sucks
[2:56:01] <+TurnipKupo> @Ninestempest omg :0
[2:56:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> 3 IS OKAY
[2:56:02] <Tracazoid> A pixel version of 3 is pretty cool to have though
[2:56:05] <%FacetiousAF> moneyt
[2:56:08] <+NiktenKing> 3make is alright
[2:56:14] <+Gouf_Troop> 3 is good tho
[2:56:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> FF3 is just FF1-2
[2:56:15] <CaptainMuscles> never heard anyone mention FF5 ever
[2:56:16] <%BoxNavy> Kreygasm oh shit
[2:56:19] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt 3 is okay till the end
[2:56:21] <%Akizea> you take that back aout 3
[2:56:23] <Forester_Skippy> 3 was meh but the music slaps
[2:56:28] <Zeikier> can confirm FF5 rules!
[2:56:28] <%FacetiousAF> psaGib ff5 stream
[2:56:29] <+NiktenKing> Butz
[2:56:30] <+CookieCutter007> how's the crt shader
[2:56:32] <CanonHusbando> tactics though
[2:56:32] <Zebroneath> I beat FF5 last month. It's great!
[2:56:33] <linSP> I’m enjoying FF1 remastered, I’m excited to try FF3 with snes pixels
[2:56:33] <%crimsonharvest> im kind of impressed at the ff1 soundtrack arrangement in the remaster
[2:56:34] <+Gouf_Troop> 5 is great
[2:56:35] <theanora1> now if they'd only put it on console
[2:56:35] <%Agami23> best job system
[2:56:36] <%BoxNavy> that job system baby
[2:56:38] <Zeikier> you do any 4 Job Fiesta runs pat?
[2:56:38] <%DavidCrimsonHeidern> Butz
[2:56:40] <%FacetiousAF> 5 has the train suplex right?
[2:56:40] <+Hilleltaco> @Breedofevil Never feel forced to skip cutscenes to avoid holding people up, if they run off without you it's their fault
[2:56:44] <%Agami23> fun blue mage
[2:56:46] <+pupil31> WELCOME TO JOBLAND
[2:56:47] <%FacetiousAF> oooo job system?
[2:56:48] <%FacetiousAF> mmmm
[2:56:50] <%Akizea> @FacetiousAF thats 6
[2:56:51] <dd44dostivei> no
[2:56:51] <%Agami23> has ex death who is rad as fuck
[2:56:52] <linSP> FFV is criminally underrated
[2:56:54] <Moondoggie25> Now if only those idiots would put it on switch
[2:56:54] <+NiktenKing> DO JOB GET JOB
[2:56:56] <nocturnPhoenix> I never really got into Final Fantasy before but I've been sucked into ff14 and just finished Shadowbringers so I need to roll it back and try some of the old ones
[2:57:02] <%crimsonharvest> i never could beat FF5 before i tried it in the Fiesta format, i always got trapped leveling up jobs
[2:57:03] <%chance_h> I got a job from chat's mom last night.
[2:57:04] <$StrawberryPantsu> @FacetiousAF That was 6
[2:57:05] <ExpressNode> I wonder why you don't like Bravely Default. That game is jobs for days
[2:57:05] <oedocontroller> do they just all colors of mages?
[2:57:07] <%Dementedpenguin> New people: don't play FFV for the plot. It's all about the Job System
[2:57:24] <Blank9> FF5 has good character/banter though.
[2:57:26] <%megadblitz> oh man I missed the end of unite?
[2:57:31] <%BoxNavy> good
[2:57:45] <%AzureGale> NOT THE YOUNGLINGS
[2:57:45] <%GarbageNirvana> You can play FFV with a full party of Berserkers if that's the kinda psychopath you are
