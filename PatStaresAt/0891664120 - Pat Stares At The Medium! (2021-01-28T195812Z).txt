[0:55:55] <%Ancopro> the power to run
[0:55:55] <mortificent> this is quite a DOWNPOUR
[0:55:55] <TheViltsuZ> Observer map reused?
[0:55:55] <penitentpendant> The power of walking speed
[0:55:56] <+alternative_flu> she walks at medium speed
[0:55:56] <Borkbiff > I'd say more of a large
[0:55:59] <%Starotter70> Good
[0:55:59] <%BoxNavy> good
[0:56:00] <Brothermanhyll> bad game turnm it off
[0:56:01] <+thefishofwar> she's medium rare at best
[0:56:09] <+TheBitingIrish> LB, I think
[0:56:10] <+squidlord482> Left trigger to run
[0:56:11] <reonome> this is very haunting ground
[0:56:11] <+gustavozxd> is that why that's the name of the game ü§î
[0:56:11] <+takutoots> LUL
[0:56:13] <%sonlascivious> is it at least a good fixed camera?
[0:56:15] <%Tomfom25> does Pat have Tank controls
[0:56:15] <%Alazull> Game looks pretty
[0:56:16] <%dekkitout> Her shoe size- 7 1/7
[0:56:16] <Leviathan0010> @PatStaresAt Did you know Yakuza 3,4 and 5 is now on steam remastered?
[0:56:17] <MayShip> broken down people usually walk at medium speed. can confirm
[0:56:18] <+ThisIsLloyd> She likes Medium done steaks
[0:56:19] <%Broand> Did you hear about the psychic dwarf who's on the run from the law?
[0:56:19] <$crusader_raul> @TheViltsuZ looks a lot like it
[0:56:20] <heartlesshealer> weird balcony netting that I assume has a purpose
[0:56:22] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So i guess this game is MEDIUM uality?
[0:56:23] <%SharkMissile> Didn't Adam Sandler sing a song about this
[0:56:26] <%ghostofsolomon> but if she rarely is a medium you could say she is medium raaareeee
[0:56:28] <icosahedral> she's a rare medium whose job was well done
[0:56:29] <+TheBitingIrish> !uptime
[0:56:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 56m 40s.
[0:56:29] <%captain_thickthighs> oh so medium as in between, I feel so dumb
[0:56:30] <Dragon_Batman> Probably indoor speeds or something

[0:56:37] <penitentpendant> A Small Medium at Large
[0:56:43] <Broand> He's a small medium at large
[0:56:44] <%Taisuru> Game is called The Medium cause it's a solid 5/10
[0:56:44] <allanmiri> @Broand I know that's not real. But it would be fucking sick if it was.
[0:56:46] <+LazyBumNetwork> Is there an option for tank controls? @patstaresat
[0:56:47] <sydowoodo> not yet
[0:56:52] <Dragon_Batman> Or some prologue slow build

[0:57:04] <+gustavozxd> that's a sad name but I guess it IS a funeral
[0:57:05] <%watts121> So if she's a Medium, does that mean this game is about conning old widows out of money?

[0:58:17] <allanmiri> This music and house gives me The Shining vides.
[0:58:18] <%DrBunni> So is this game a walking simulator so far or is there combat?
[0:58:27] <%purple_bagel> The Poggdrasil
[0:58:30] <TheViltsuZ> Observer ui

[0:58:51] <%ghostofsolomon> very good pat very good
[0:58:53] <%UvBenServed> Are those vases filled with ashes?
[0:58:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The problem with these type of games is that none will ever surpass Deadly Premonition
[0:58:55] <%madmanrambler> madmanrambler subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 13 months! first video series I remember watching with pat in it was silent hill, feels right to hit 13 months watching more silent hill
[0:58:55] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I see dead people
[0:58:58] <+HalcyonNineThousand> in urns
[0:59:09] <pk_piss> if theres magical spells to fight monster with im going shit my pants
[0:59:12] <%ghostofsolomon> but no taxidermy things
[0:59:12] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt is this by the same people that made Observer? (I feel like it was but I'm not remembering)
[0:59:14] <Cactuskris> great camera
[0:59:15] <%watts121> @DrBunni it's a Silent Hill clones so I imagine it'll be a lil bit before we shoot monsters
[0:59:17] <thetruenicster> Irons getting off on Taxidermy down below
[0:59:17] <+gustavozxd> I feel like people call games walking simulators whenever they don't have combat, so basically Talos Principle is a walking sim with that logic
[0:59:21] <mortificent> creepy sex dungeons?
[0:59:22] <+HalcyonNineThousand> people are dying to get in there
[0:59:25] <Brothermanhyll> Jack always made me solve video game puzzles before I got anything, like opening a can of beans
[0:59:32] <SaltyAzteca> Speaking of, you got any plans for an RE stream for the upcoming RE8?
[0:59:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OH RLY?
[0:59:37] <anAngryHamster> Which Observer?
[0:59:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Observer was rad
[0:59:40] <allanmiri> Oh shit! Are we gonna autopsy her dad!1?
[0:59:42] <$crusader_raul> Dan Lazarski was my hero
[0:59:45] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh, she has the tree on her jacket
[0:59:46] <%ghostofsolomon> omg
[0:59:47] <%DrBunni> @watts121 thanks for letting me know.
[0:59:48] <dukenux> id wish more modern games would utilize fixed camera angles

[0:59:52] <%sniffy77> Hi Mr shit
[0:59:55] <+alternative_flu> I guess he's a deadbeat dad?
[0:59:55] <%LymanAl> NOOO
[0:59:55] <%purple_bagel> God i hope re8‚Äôs ps4 version runs ok
[0:59:55] <TheViltsuZ> Gamers are still immature enough to call any game without combat ""walking simulator""
[0:59:56] <BlkFlameKami> 'sup.
[0:59:56] <DracaenaLeaf> hey dead person
[0:59:57] <%lockhead45> Shouldn't she be put off by the fact nobody is really around?

[1:06:00] <mr_saturday93> don't beyond two souls this
[1:06:00] <rjhascancer> it starts with a dead girl @PatStaresAt
[1:06:02] <+takutoots> Devil Trigger!
[1:06:02] <+thefishofwar> she's a medium becuase she's half tree
[1:06:03] <+solzan2000> I guess its a mechanic
[1:06:04] <+alternative_flu> medium brightness
[1:06:05] <$dalmek> actually she's a Medium because she is Beyond Two Souls Kappa
[1:06:06] <%kyh9> It looks like Fungus, which is the main decomposer in forests
[1:06:06] <+TheBitingIrish> SHe never called him father pepehands
[1:06:07] <fuji_92> also STRANDS
[1:06:07] <dukenux> what?
[1:06:07] <%baka_sugoi> she got the blood of SPARTA
[1:06:07] <randomahole> it's like the arm from DP2
[1:06:08] <+tigerfang86> STRAND MEANS STRAND
[1:06:08] <+BootyFriend> Ugh this is hitting a bit too close right now
[1:06:09] <+fearlesscoward9> She's a stand user
[1:06:10] <madejustforchat> the main character looks like the one in control and claire redfield
[1:06:10] <%NovaKnightmare> Thats bullshit but I belive it
[1:06:12] <Ell1ot> i'm dead inside. am i a medium?
[1:06:12] <%LymanAl> As a lefty, I am very sinister
[1:06:13] <%Valdorick> FUCK YOU PAT! I'M LEFT HANDED AND HATE YOU
[1:06:13] <+thefishofwar> weed get out
[1:06:14] <+tigerfang86> THE STRAND STANDS FOR STRAND
[1:06:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEP
[1:06:17] <%linSP> Hey guys when did pat start
[1:06:17] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> @PatStaresAt as a left handed person, can confirm, totally satan side
[1:06:17] <+sixcubit> of course she's half-dead, her dad is a ghost
[1:06:19] <+gustavozxd> that's a David Cage kind of right
[1:06:20] <%kyh9> It looks like her left arm is filled with Fungus, which is used to decompose stuff
[1:06:21] <Mobilebeardunit> how much have i missed?
[1:06:22] <%lockhead45> It was all a dream
[1:06:22] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt Sinister. Yeah either she died, or almost died
[1:06:23] <+HalcyonNineThousand> that‚Äôs why I masturbate with my left hand
[1:06:24] <%ghostofsolomon> not liking the narration
[1:06:26] <mortificent> It's a horror game, of course it's gonna be stupid
[1:06:32] <dukenux> The Medium stands for Strand
[1:06:34] <%Taisuru> Daddy Kreygasm
[1:06:34] <%SirGO0SE> didnt it say "starts with a dead girl" tho
[1:06:37] <%baka_sugoi> FATHER
[1:06:37] <%ghostofsolomon> shud have just let the scene play out without narration
[1:06:39] <%chiazam> DADDY
[1:06:41] <%Dakuu75> schizophrenia the game
[1:06:41] <+TheBitingIrish> She couldn't even say it to his face FeelsBadMan
[1:06:43] <%bunchaghosts> The leftorium was unholy thats why it got ransacked
[1:06:44] <Garry_Guyface> Does that mean the broken bone part of my left leg is a hit-point I can perform kick attacks against ghosts with???
[1:06:44] <%watts121> why would she say Daddy instead of Dad...
[1:06:48] <MayShip> this game could be as stupid as it wants to be and still be better than Beyond Two Souls
[1:06:50] <Brothermanhyll> beyond two sould?
[1:06:54] <%purple_bagel> I hope theres a bit where shes doing something on the right side and on the left side you see a creepy ghost coming towards her but she cant see it. That would be cool i think
[1:06:55] <$NoctisxMog> so lefties are evil?
[1:06:56] <%watts121> Paige would you say Daddy instead of Dad in this instance?

[1:07:30] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:07:31] <+HalcyonNineThousand> why did she answer
[1:07:33] <ThatButler> Hot take, she uses the Medium trauma as an excuse to hide the fact that she's an alcoholic.

[1:08:07] <+cvp5127> alan wake?
[1:08:08] <+nirvana227> the light monkaS
[1:08:08] <allanmiri> @ghostofsolomon Narration is sometimes used when the writer doesn't have confidence they can tell the story clearly otherwise. I personally think the writer should've given themself mofe credit for this scene because I think we'd be able to follow it without narration.
[1:08:09] <Garry_Guyface> I NEED TO TELL YOU ABOUT XENU
[1:08:11] <Srthunda> I have heard scam calls more natural than that

[1:17:50] <+Veraverse> LUL
[1:17:52] <+GenesisKnight> He knows
[1:17:52] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:17:52] <rytisone> he knows
[1:17:52] <+LazyBumNetwork> I already don‚Äôt like their idea of ghosts in this game..
[1:17:57] <ralphfromdk> He can feel the ghosts!!!
[1:17:58] <+Shotgundam009> nvm I see
[1:17:59] <allanmiri> Geif is such a troll.
[1:17:59] <CookieCutter007> the dog senses fear
[1:18:00] <%ssjklyco> How is that different from your noises?
[1:18:00] <+strakillias> The run and camera changes look like they are stolen from Dino Crisis or early RE games
[1:18:00] <+Grayhammatter> he knows
[1:18:00] <Dragon_Batman> The universe works in mysterious ways LUL
[1:18:01] <+LokimenD> Zangief is scared :(
[1:18:02] <%UvBenServed> It enhances the experience
[1:18:02] <Brothermanhyll> White people are crazy

[1:18:17] <%Romuken> insight the tree
[1:18:21] <%Romuken> insight the birds
[1:18:21] <majindusto> Why do you gotta describe it so sarcastically?
[1:18:24] <%UvBenServed> Already broken up
[1:18:26] <Parapattern> What the hell do you think it is, Lady?
[1:18:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @KaitlynnHere Well i didnt make up. I sure wish her daughter did tho
[1:18:29] <+HalcyonNineThousand> The game takes itself to seriously to take it seriously
[1:18:32] <+nirvana227> nothing?
[1:18:36] <%LymanAl> babby hand
[1:18:38] <DelgotHansto> The T might be the Thomas who knows though
[1:18:38] <s1rcuit> "We're the future and we'll never die."
[1:18:41] <KaitlynnHere> @uvbenserved lasted three months
[1:18:47] <+Veraverse> Insight the government drone...Or birds, idk how you call it
[1:18:54] <marrowjuice> is writing initials in trees actually a thing irl, because I have literally never seen it on an irl tree
[1:18:55] <rytisone> pick some mushrooms for dinner
[1:18:57] <Dragon_Batman> Maybe a hand print or something to show a trail
[1:18:57] <%topendbuzza> bug?
[1:18:57] <+Grayhammatter> a whole buncha bullshit nothing
[1:18:58] <MrBaldachin> a cinematic straight line
[1:18:59] <KaitlynnHere> @uvbenserved all be it that‚Äôs the longest both of them have been in a relationship
[1:19:00] <Tham1k> Tree souls
[1:19:06] <TheViltsuZ> This is on game pass PC/console.
[1:19:07] <allanmiri> I think they might be hand prints, but not sure.
[1:19:13] <Freezerhorse> child handprints, i think
[1:19:16] <Dragon_Batman> It's a little kids handprint
[1:19:21] <+HalcyonNineThousand> what‚Äôs with the lighting
[1:19:27] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Is it intentional?
[1:19:33] <rjhascancer> dont run, we cant load everything that fast!
[1:19:33] <penitentpendant> This feels like a game where a person had a movie pitch but sold it to a game company
[1:19:41] <%logoth_> ING!!
[1:19:43] <Arek_1> @marrowjuice Not just trees. Benches, school desks. Yeah, that was very much a thing.
[1:19:45] <%Dakuu75> Didn't we stop at a gas station or something? why're we at a fort now?
[1:19:52] <%topendbuzza> how bout no
[1:19:52] <%BoxNavy> no
[1:19:58] <$dalmek> the dinosaur ghosts were exorcised by the meteor
[1:19:58] <%hopendreamlesss> sweet
[1:19:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THATD BE RAD
[1:19:59] <s1rcuit> only in video games can you not walk over something that is shorter than the gap of your natural stride
[1:19:59] <%purple_bagel> The weird lighting is ghost vision
[1:19:59] <%BoxNavy> they would kil you for sure
[1:20:00] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> mummy ghosts pog
[1:20:02] <nilla_24> it would
[1:20:04] <+Veraverse> RE6 let's go
[1:20:04] <MyNameIsRasus> and shoot'em with spirit blast
[1:20:05] <ergulor> that would be pretty swell
[1:20:07] <s1rcuit> dino ghosts would be rad
[1:20:08] <Dragon_Batman> What's polands folklore maybe?
[1:20:09] <+Grayhammatter> that'd be rad
[1:20:10] <peachy996> Not if its lame looking dinosaur ghosts
[1:20:10] <mortificent> A DINO CRISIS,if you will
[1:20:12] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Cast your Spirit Blast at the dino ghosts
[1:20:12] <KaitlynnHere> @arek_1 don‚Äôt forgot into lead painted walls
[1:20:12] <%watts121> @Dakuu75 it was more like an abandoned checkpoint

[1:20:34] <spongeofmystery> But I don't want to cure cancer, I want to turn people into dinosaur ghosts
[1:20:34] <+alloVera> @HalcyonNineThousand when pat uses the 'insight' skill the lighting changes
[1:20:35] <biomegabear> I hope this is better than downcoming
[1:20:36] <%LymanAl> I NEED MY PIIIIIILLLLLS
[1:20:38] <Karakuioshi> @PatStaresAt take your pills pat!

[1:20:44] <s1rcuit> the white hair looks good on her
[1:20:50] <KaitlynnHere> I like her white hair
[1:20:51] <Dragon_Batman> I like the idea of it being an actual split
[1:20:54] <JoshManVGH> Is this twin stick?
[1:20:56] <+HalcyonNineThousand> if a game had a story to tell, I‚Äôd have turned it off by now
[1:20:56] <Zeif00> OH NO THE GHOST MAMMARIES
[1:21:00] <+holyxgrale> I can understand why this game would be a 30 fps lock
[1:21:00] <allanmiri> Okay, I know you're all joking, but Dino Ghosts would make me run out and buy this game right now.
[1:21:00] <%swesterly> Is it just me or is the writing kind of bad
[1:21:00] <%Infernal_Dalek> Play this with a VR headset, lol
[1:21:01] <penitentpendant> I'm somewhat surprised no one has made "There's a line on your screen" reference yet
[1:21:01] <biomegabear> her devil trigger hair
[1:21:02] <dukenux> oh this game has co op Kappa
[1:21:04] <anAngryHamster> 15 years ago I had a Shaman King OC who was an archeologist with a velociraptor spirit
[1:21:07] <Srthunda> wait was that noise geef or that game
[1:21:07] <+cvp5127> can you desync?
[1:21:08] <+Tarkus110> so she has a devil trigger LUL
[1:21:09] <brunoberserk> YOU DRIVIN ME INSAAAANE
[1:21:10] <+CptnCampy61> Oh this is weird
[1:21:11] <zettig> I wonder if a game like would have even been possible in 4:3.
[1:21:11] <lazerscraper> SPIRIT TRIGGER?
[1:21:11] <+Veraverse> Oh look, it's Kara from Detroit Become Human with white hair!
[1:21:16] <+TrevIn3Dimensions> @PatStaresAt hows Elmo?
[1:21:17] <%Starotter70> huh
[1:21:22] <heartlesshealer> oh hey
[1:21:24] <Bloodninja15> "Never in a million years" - Marianne
[1:21:25] <+takutoots> oh
[1:21:26] <heartlesshealer> different prompts
[1:21:28] <%Dakuu75> @JoshManVGH naw, you're just controlling both at the same time, like it's a single character
[1:21:29] <Dragon_Batman> Ooooh that's really neat actually
[1:21:30] <rytisone> left ps, right xbox
[1:21:33] <%hopendreamlesss> alright, thats neat
[1:21:34] <KaitlynnHere> I soon will have white hair, I‚Äôm excited. I‚Äôll probably have a full head of white hair by the time I‚Äôm in my mid 30s
[1:21:45] <marrowjuice> i wish the ghost dimension had a cooler aesthetic
[1:21:49] <%AllenDeadman> shit's locked
[1:22:00] <Pookiedaexzile> and people
[1:22:02] <JoshManVGH> @dakuu75 Neat!
[1:22:03] <CookieCutter007> :)
[1:22:04] <dukenux> The Matrix rules
[1:22:11] <Dragon_Batman> Ball and all
[1:22:12] <%LymanAl> Them kids draw fast
[1:22:16] <+GenesisKnight> this is the part where you leave
[1:22:17] <penitentpendant> That's a quick draw
[1:22:18] <%BoxNavy> eerie monkaS
[1:22:22] <majindusto> Dont get Ghost Slapped!!!
[1:22:23] <%AllenDeadman> probably
[1:22:23] <$dalmek> specifically her 'spirit (?)' version
[1:22:26] <+LazyBumNetwork> God that jog
[1:22:26] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:22:26] <Dragon_Batman> Most likely
[1:22:29] <heartlesshealer> probably, yeah
[1:22:30] <+Veraverse> You'll run faster on the PS6!
[1:22:31] <+redthebaron> yeah that is a good guess
[1:22:31] <+Grayhammatter> probably
[1:22:35] <TheAntiNihilist> yup
[1:22:39] <Arek_1> Also, you know. Burn damage.
[1:22:41] <dukenux> this reminds me of Constantine's(movie) hell
[1:22:43] <%Broand> remember gang, being a medium means you're passively letting spirits work through you instead of being an active element. don't be a medium, be a wizard instead
[1:22:43] <%debugdrawray_> yeah i could do without the narrations
[1:22:45] <JoshManVGH> My game runs at 20 Steps per Minute
[1:22:50] <Srthunda> ya this narration feels useless
[1:22:51] <Pookiedaexzile> THe glorious technology of Split screening
[1:22:51] <%Starotter70> oh my
[1:22:52] <allanmiri> I'm gonna say it... Chicks with white hair are hot.
[1:22:54] <dots4eyes> A thousand years of ghosts
[1:22:55] <+GenesisKnight> Ooooooh I hate the look of that
[1:22:55] <%BoxNavy> that might be a little horrible
[1:22:57] <$dalmek> yeah but it's cool though
[1:22:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Truly a next gen achievement
[1:23:00] <+gustavozxd> looks like an upgrade thing
[1:23:04] <%AllenDeadman> are those... moths...
[1:23:04] <Parapattern> History does just happen. That's what history is.
[1:23:05] <mortificent> Yeah this narration...
[1:23:06] <atgithursdays> When the class war comes will Pat be spared or will his big big mommy money milkers get milked?
[1:23:10] <tacoisgoods> I dig the otherworld
[1:23:13] <TheViltsuZ> Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski
[1:23:14] <Brothermanhyll> This looks like Zdizlav Bedskinski stuff
[1:23:15] <timarkot> Left or right chat?
[1:23:15] <+takutoots> soul juice
[1:23:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Hit the Juice Spot
[1:23:16] <%debugdrawray_> like id rather just guess and take in the enviroment than have her always talking
[1:23:17] <rytisone> that was a power up for doomguy
[1:23:17] <MrBaldachin> filled with ghost juice
[1:23:19] <Freezerhorse> DT gauge refilled
[1:23:21] <%swesterly> Yeah the writing on the narration is pretty cringe
[1:23:22] <%BoxNavy> juice dwn
[1:23:23] <ittla> i'd give them props for not just copying silent hill nightmare world aesthetics though they are just blatantly copying beksinski's paintings
[1:23:25] <+Grayhammatter> BANG BANG BANG, pull my DEVIL TRIGGER
[1:23:26] <%Mr_Pylon> Juice up to juice out later
[1:23:26] <heartlesshealer> Her feathery arm stuff is just power coils
[1:23:26] <brunoberserk> woolie hole : the game
[1:23:28] <ittla> looks good though
[1:23:30] <JoshManVGH> Mean left hook!
[1:23:32] <%NovaKnightmare> yea girl get juicy
[1:23:33] <Dragon_Batman> Bolth
[1:23:34] <%Dunmarkh> is this ghost cannibalism?
[1:23:35] <majindusto> Stop saying Juice
[1:23:37] <maskedmook> are you gonna fight ghosts with the spirit arm?
[1:23:37] <%Taisuru> What does the juice do in gunslinger?
[1:23:43] <Brothermanhyll> Not a bad source of inspo at all
[1:23:45] <%Dakuu75> yeah, build meter so you can EX fireball
[1:23:46] <%topendbuzza> no?
[1:23:46] <%Starotter70> SPIRIT BLAST
[1:23:48] <sydowoodo> destiny is destiny
[1:23:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Juice the Juice Box
[1:23:49] <+GenesisKnight> Spirit Gun!
[1:23:51] <+takutoots> i mean yes but no
[1:23:51] <SaltyAzteca> Destiny is destiny Kappa
[1:23:51] <+Grayhammatter> SPIRIT GUN
[1:23:52] <%watts121> these camera angles are hitting me with nostalgia
[1:23:52] <TheViltsuZ> @ittla It's inspired by Bleksinski
[1:23:54] <Laecerelius> Juice galaxy
[1:23:57] <%AdamElJefe> She's just like the prince of persia with her ghost arm
[1:23:59] <biomegabear> spirit wave
[1:23:59] <dukenux> good for me :)
[1:24:07] <JoshManVGH> Using souls to power technology has never had downsides
[1:24:09] <+gustavozxd> ebola 2
[1:24:12] <Elsewize> Oh that's cool.
[1:24:17] <+LyteSpawn> Can you choose to be in only one dimension or is it double vision all the time by default?
[1:24:17] <penitentpendant> Perhaps with a bolt cutter though
[1:24:18] <%SuperButterBuns> the title of this game is just one big pun huh
[1:24:19] <ittla> less inspired and more like
[1:24:19] <Visorak6> Counterpoint: bolt cutters
[1:24:19] <+LazyBumNetwork> I was hoping for a SH... I guess this game is ok as it‚Äôs own thing... big disappointment though.
[1:24:26] <Brothermanhyll> What is it with poles and photosensitivity
[1:24:27] <+Pilau32> Is she gonna be talking all the time the whole game?
[1:24:27] <%Taisuru> That is very extreme
[1:24:28] <ittla> beksinski should get an art direction credit
[1:24:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Just remember that this game is based on the award winning day time television franhised
[1:24:31] <+redthebaron> only ghost powered allowed
[1:24:34] <%BoxNavy> hope no one in chat has epilepsy
[1:24:35] <mortificent> Hey Buns
[1:24:36] <+Veraverse> Imagine not having ghost powers
[1:24:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> You were almost a bolt cutter sandwich
[1:24:38] <%BigHooppaw> agreed
[1:24:41] <%Taisuru> That gave me a headache
[1:24:43] <%Starotter70> Hey Buns
[1:24:44] <%bevyrage> maybe the discomfort is intended
[1:24:45] <CookieCutter007> my eyes watering means it's working
[1:24:46] <+gimmickypizza> I kind already already don‚Äôt like this game this gimmick
[1:24:46] <heartlesshealer> yeah, it's just annoying
[1:24:46] <dukenux> yea
[1:24:47] <Parapattern> But light blink real fast tho
[1:24:49] <%Dakuu75> yeah, they could've made that transition less... painful.
[1:24:49] <Zeif00> hay boons
[1:24:51] <+CptnCampy61> Are we looking at a difference in time or two different dimensions?
[1:24:52] <%LymanAl> YOU HAVE TO FEEL THE NARRATIVE
[1:24:52] <peachy996> I think they're fine
[1:24:53] <%Broand> use toast powers
[1:24:57] <%watts121> Yeah if she didn't have ghost powers, she could just go home.
[1:24:58] <$Afterman_> hey @PatStaresAt did you see the video of a bear chasing a skier?
[1:25:02] <dukenux> but ze art
[1:25:04] <+hornydino_> oh look a wild butterbuns
[1:25:04] <+takutoots> beware of fyre
[1:25:06] <+Veraverse> But you feel like you're having a seizure!
[1:25:08] <lyzejag> If there's no options to disable it than it's fucking dangerous
[1:25:08] <+Grayhammatter> bork
[1:25:08] <%AllenDeadman> dry leaves and dead trees burn good
[1:25:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Light Blink real smooth
[1:25:11] <rei0> ghost in the house
[1:25:11] <JoshManVGH> My phone died, better go ghost up at the cemetery
[1:25:13] <%CatastropheCorvid> Even if you "Don't" have epilepsy, it'd be a pretty shitty way to find out.
[1:25:15] <$floralkami> @patstaresat you know what would've been a great feature for this game, show off the power of the system with its simultaneous area loading, and finally make better use of that dang touchpad on the controller? making the filter use a slider the player could use all at any amount. Would also make for great jump scares. feel free to use this concept if anyone in chat is a game dev. I'm too lazy
[1:25:18] <%BoxNavy> icky!!!
[1:25:19] <ergulor> maybe you can burn the 65% of the body that you didn't burn last time
[1:25:19] <+takutoots> deer vampire
[1:25:20] <+Grayhammatter> where's ja though?
[1:25:20] <%BinaryFireball> is that a tsuchinoko ?????
[1:25:21] <+GenesisKnight> What the fuck is up with its neck
[1:25:24] <%AllenDeadman> he got ghost succed
[1:25:24] <+redthebaron> got spoked
[1:25:24] <heart_ablaze> isn't the intention to make you feel uncomfortable?
[1:25:25] <dukenux> ghost wolves PogChamp
[1:25:28] <%purple_bagel> It may not run super great but the art direction is fantastic
[1:25:28] <%watts121> Absorb it's spirit power!
[1:25:30] <%Romuken> insight the deer
[1:25:31] <marrowjuice> uh, it died, lady
[1:25:32] <allanmiri> I remember House of the Dead 1 flashing a lot. That's why I greatly prefered the 2nd game growing up.
[1:25:33] <lazerscraper> Gief sees ghosts. GIEF WILL WRESTLE THAT GHOST
[1:25:35] <%fat_burtreynolds> Doggos see ghost?
[1:25:41] <%spookbooty> is there something wrong with me that i can no longer play a game unless it has some sort of xp/progression system
[1:25:43] <+gespenst25> hair looks good Pat.
[1:25:49] <dukenux> @heart_ablaze better ways than directly assaulting your eyes
[1:25:49] <Cactuskris> this forest looks really good
[1:25:56] <majindusto> Jeez, Paige burps so much
[1:25:56] <%Dakuu75> this is what happens when you reach 99 insight
[1:25:57] <heartlesshealer> I would have been fine to just zoom in on her face and have noise going with color dropping out until she lets go of her head
[1:25:58] <%BinaryFireball> this is the best looking forest I've seen in a game
[1:26:00] <%Dunmarkh> seizures are uncomforable
[1:26:00] <%vivaldiva> Gief will just eat the ghost
[1:26:00] <SaltyAzteca> Piledrive the ghosts back to their ethereal realm
[1:26:02] <%Dakuu75> too many eyes on the inside
[1:26:03] <heartlesshealer> It would*

[1:31:56] <allanmiri> She could find a rock or something.
[1:31:56] <%BoxNavy> glass is a bitch
[1:31:56] <dukenux> this is just a point and click adventure game, without pointing and clicking
[1:31:57] <%spookbooty> cyberpunk for example is not hard to break
[1:31:59] <heartlesshealer> some people cheap out
[1:31:59] <peachy996> and hearts
[1:32:00] <%Romuken> just a shard of porcelain can shatter your window
[1:32:04] <%AllenDeadman> my optimism and will to stay possible was supposed to be hard to break
[1:32:06] <RedShirt_Fighting_gamefan> Butt
[1:32:06] <+Malacious> that run
[1:32:08] <%Ancopro> ive seen a guy accidentally just walk into glass and it broke

[1:32:26] <dukenux> blind

[1:33:10] <TheAntiNihilist> VERY cool. VERY Silent Hill
[1:33:13] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah nah this is the good shit
[1:33:13] <+HalcyonNineThousand> is this spirit blast?
[1:33:13] <+smuggleruncle> it never gets better
[1:33:13] <mortificent> the frustration?
[1:33:14] <penitentpendant> They removed the survival, and there's barely any horror
[1:33:14] <GarbageQueenEllie> But where is the Grunge?
[1:33:15] <allanmiri> Not enough penis and vagina monsters.
[1:33:17] <Pookiedaexzile> just imagine being alone

[1:33:45] <%AllenDeadman> oh there's footprints
[1:33:46] <%watts121> I sense those kids sucked a hop scotch
[1:33:47] <%Romuken> nah i did
[1:33:49] <%Dwarven_Gaming> do the numbers say soemthign in ghost vision?
[1:33:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> What's up y'all, just got here and all I have to say is that camera is far as fuck from the character
[1:33:58] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Pat, spirit blast the door down
[1:33:59] <Parapattern> "Soviet Union? Didn't you guys break up?"
[1:34:00] <%Taisuru> If she's part tree does that mean she has wood?

[1:34:14] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:34:20] <heartlesshealer> I remember Pat asking Paige what her elf eyes hear. It was perfect
[1:34:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> not nearly enough fog. Needs at least Persona 4 December level of fog to be Silent Hill
[1:34:20] <$Hzealot> brutalism is the entire building from control the video game @patstaresat
[1:34:29] <TheAntiNihilist> pUzzLE

[1:34:35] <pk_piss> this seems frustrating
[1:34:35] <penitentpendant> I just want to smack the level designer at this point. "Yes it's pretty, but you're wasting the player's time." "BUT MUH ATMOSPHERE!"

[1:35:33] <Dragon_Batman> I'm shure the box is yummy
[1:35:33] <%slimmixrp> Maybe the foot prints hit the numbers in a weird order that's a code to some bullshit safe somewhere
[1:35:36] <penitentpendant> That is a small car
[1:35:37] <%BoxNavy> this game would have a better atmosphere if your character didnt remark on every little thing she looked at

[1:43:09] <+thefishofwar> subtext be damned
[1:43:10] <%Taisuru> SHE'S BURNED LIKE MAIN CHARACTER

[1:43:11] <%toastybites> THE SAD GAME
[1:43:11] <marvel877> Like that Wii game that never came out.
[1:43:12] <peachy996> Oh this sounds like a track from Akira
[1:43:12] <+TheBitingIrish> She's made of PLANT
[1:43:13] <+Tarkus110> butterfly in the sky. I can fly twice as high
[1:43:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> look at this Rule of Rose shit
[1:43:18] <oAznoUta> this is Quantic Dream, right? how involved was Cage in this one?
[1:43:19] <%Monkeyweed21> emoshun
[1:43:21] <%shiplord13> She's made of like twigs
[1:43:22] <+redthebaron> i'm sadness and the buterfly makes me think these are the same person
[1:43:24] <JoshManVGH> One Armed Tabitha?
[1:43:24] <+zsDirtyHarry> X Doubt
[1:43:24] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> looks like she got blown the fuck up
[1:43:25] <%topendbuzza> she hollow
[1:43:26] <+GenesisKnight> Wow. A decent child actor
[1:43:29] <%BoxNavy> oh my god if she is who i think she is im going to shit
[1:43:33] <DuoScratch> Same side, I saw
[1:43:34] <ittla> the split screen is neat but it doesnt seem to serve any puprose
[1:43:34] <Dragon_Batman> Me niether
[1:43:38] <allanmiri> The got taken by the dino ghosts
[1:43:38] <%ssjklyco> I wonder if this is how non Silent Hill protags see the the Silent Hill protag when theh are doing their bullshit
[1:43:38] <ittla> purpose*
[1:43:41] <MyNameIsRasus> GIVE US A SHOT OF THE PENDANT COWARDS
[1:43:42] <%hopendreamlesss> I think they're the same
[1:43:42] <rytisone> we all do
[1:43:43] <$Afterman_> @BoxNavy who do you think she is
[1:43:44] <%Dunmarkh> "live"
[1:43:45] <zephlink> Both pendants are the same
[1:43:45] <TheViltsuZ> PERVERT
[1:43:48] <crocboyz> its the same side
[1:43:48] <MrBaldachin> I know it's like, the whole theme of the game, but I don't feel the split-scene adds anything to this
[1:43:48] <%SaiyanShoto> The music is great
[1:43:55] <%Taisuru> Pervert
[1:43:55] <%megaman_sentinel> no pendent?
[1:43:57] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I really like the look of the ghost world
[1:44:02] <timarkot> They look like monsters to you?
[1:44:04] <JoshManVGH> why are arms getting jacked up in this game?
[1:44:07] <%shurtal> and GOING and COMING
[1:44:12] <+Raiden_Breaker> this is cool for the first time but now its more of a hindrance
[1:44:13] <+HalcyonNineThousand> what is the point of this shot
[1:44:14] <%Infernal_Dalek> Gonna run into a fat guy eatin' pizza and/or throwing up?
[1:44:14] <+zsDirtyHarry> The shinning
[1:44:16] <GarbageQueenEllie> They should've just had occasional scene transitions between realms, wouldve worked better
[1:44:19] <+TheBitingIrish> That hollowed arm is making me queasy
[1:44:19] <Rav_Rabies> saw it earlier looked like the same side
[1:44:20] <DracaenaLeaf> Yep
[1:44:22] <Dragon_Batman> It looks liek the same side
[1:44:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah it's a little weird that the split screen is staying the whole time
[1:44:23] <%BoxNavy> the pendant is not mirrored
[1:44:25] <peachy996> Remember Laura
[1:44:25] <+Delenay> it looks like its the right side
[1:44:25] <+HalcyonNineThousand> like hide something in the real world if you‚Äôre doing thos
[1:44:28] <%chiazam> how long till she gets angry
[1:44:28] <%Deft_Thought> You should get that arm looked at, kiddo
[1:44:28] <%furiousfurioso> same side
[1:44:30] <%Starotter70> It might be the same side
[1:44:35] <MyNameIsRasus> Boo no mirror pendant
[1:44:36] <+Skelegroove> We need a random NPC to look at her funny during these segments
[1:44:37] <%purple_bagel> I love how she just chills with the ghosts. Its a nice change of pace from other horror games
[1:44:48] <Freezerhorse> eurojank aside, the style of the ghost world is rad af
[1:44:50] <%BoxNavy> lets see if this kid has the other half of the pendant
[1:44:52] <penitentpendant> Same on both sides. That's... somewhat disappointing honestly.
[1:44:57] <+HalcyonNineThousand> the devs think they‚Äôre smarter than they are
[1:44:58] <+Delenay> is on thomas i bet
[1:45:03] <%hopendreamlesss> I like that you can see her acting like a crazy person in the real world.
[1:45:05] <MyNameIsRasus> WITH THESE GOD HANDS
[1:45:07] <allanmiri> Yeah the pendant will give her Devil Trigger.
[1:45:07] <rytisone> the fusion dance
[1:45:08] <%Agami23> or the rival has the other half
[1:45:09] <+storebrandcandy> straight double dragoning
[1:45:10] <%super_ej8> like the Double Dragon live action movie?
[1:45:10] <+Veraverse> *Screams in half pendant*
[1:45:12] <%Taisuru> That's when you get DT
[1:45:13] <%megaman_sentinel> do that again pls
[1:45:14] <+vicar_anat> BEYOND TWO PENDANT
[1:45:14] <%Infernal_Dalek> Who do you have to defeat to get the other magic arm?
[1:45:14] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt bets on the girl being part of the main character?
[1:45:16] <Dragon_Batman> Or it broke off when she "died" and that is the reveal
[1:45:17] <s1rcuit> that's how you unlock the SPIRIT GUN
[1:45:17] <mr_saturday93> pat looked like he was squeezing his man boobs
[1:45:19] <+MugenSandan> she'll get the pendant and do the DBZ fusion dance
[1:45:19] <filialpails> and it'll lead the way to the cave of wonders
[1:45:21] <JoshManVGH> Wait is White Haired her not NIWA?
[1:45:22] <%dekkitout> And then she'll get a STRAND of white hair in the mortal coil or something
[1:45:24] <%debugdrawray_> lol unless they fucked it up and just put it on the wrong side of the gameplay model
[1:45:24] <+HalcyonNineThousand> that‚Äôs when Y2K starts
[1:45:25] <+Veraverse> Cool song
[1:45:27] <%Romuken> how do you know it's the same side? Pendants swish and shit all the time, and butterflies are symmetrical.
[1:45:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> i think it's super cool that the little girl has a china doll mask and one arm
[1:45:30] <+takutoots> music
[1:45:30] <MyNameIsRasus> Yo this song tho
[1:45:31] <%topendbuzza> i need the soundtrack
[1:45:33] <+TheBitingIrish> She's made of PLANT
[1:45:35] <+HeroSolaire> SO how good is this game so far chat?
[1:45:35] <TheAntiNihilist> WHY TWO SCREENS ALREADY!!!?
[1:45:36] <+redthebaron> i would really rather they just changed the worlds in between shots instead of the dual screen but it looks rad still
[1:45:39] <%RyderTokage> Jesus this mixing
[1:45:39] <Dragon_Batman> I really like this song dam
[1:45:40] <%superc37> so whats the point of the top screen again?
[1:45:41] <peachy996> Yeah this is like Doll's Polyphony
[1:45:42] <vivianann> Yeah song is the bomb
[1:45:42] <Zeif00> The mixing on this fuck
[1:45:43] <MrHeisenbird> So far there‚Äôs no point in this being a video game over a movie...
[1:45:44] <%chiazam> whoops

[1:46:24] <+redthebaron> going into a fucking elevator in an abandoned building is wild
[1:46:25] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt If this game was japanese, she'd have heterochromia to represent she can see both sides
[1:46:27] <%slimmixrp> I can see why it runs at 30 if its loading both worlds
[1:46:27] <%BoxNavy> sadness...
[1:46:28] <+TheBitingIrish> @vicar_anat Did you even play TWEWY?
[1:46:29] <s1rcuit> I just realized it's Time for Sadness
[1:46:29] <%debugdrawray_> ghost elevator
[1:46:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Bowlth
[1:46:29] <lazerscraper> Wheres the area that just becomes the main hall of the spencer mansion
[1:46:36] <servicesuspension> I like that it keeps the silent hill camera thing, but the fact you can see clearly what's real and what's not really detracts
[1:46:39] <ComfyFox> unghokay
[1:46:39] <Essixian> Unghokay
[1:46:39] <%Monkeyweed21> her real name is David Cage
[1:46:41] <$StormingRLP> Her movements seem weird...Even while's facing Marianne in the other world. Looks...fake for lack of a better word.
[1:46:42] <peachy996> It's Indigo Prophecy
[1:46:42] <$Afterman_> sadness=Marianne, betting on it
[1:46:42] <%BoxNavy> Unghokay

[1:47:37] <+AzureWolfStrke> why didn't she do that to go up the stairs?
[1:47:38] <servicesuspension> she reminds me of the girl from Control
[1:47:38] <%anticrust> I love how this looks
[1:47:41] <allanmiri> @timarkot Not enough rape for it to be that.
[1:47:42] <ittla> stapled onto another beksinski painting
[1:47:44] <+Grayhammatter> oh, she melting real bad
[1:47:48] <pk_piss> this game couldve really benefited from some better animators

[1:49:30] <Dragon_Batman> ye
[1:49:31] <%Starotter70> Little bit
[1:49:32] <allanmiri> So far the game is interesting, but not scary at all. It feels more like a supernatural drama so far instead of a horror game.
[1:49:33] <%Taisuru> Nah, but I feel it in my heart
[1:49:34] <%spookbooty> attach second mic to pigdog collar
[1:49:37] <%megaman_sentinel> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp notice me human
[1:49:40] <+HeroSolaire> They should have just a button to switch realms instead of this Heavy Rain Indigo Prophecy double vision
[1:49:40] <%chiazam> This fucking dog lmfao
[1:49:43] <majindusto> WOW, being a Mobile Watcher scottfThinkle
[1:49:56] <+Grayhammatter> this dog is a mess
[1:50:00] <servicesuspension> the fact you can see the real world at all times really fucks the atmosphere
[1:50:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Is it possible to configure this game to play on two different monitors if you have two? Because that would be cool
[1:50:02] <%Sargonyx> Dog playing with squeaky toy sounds makes me so happy :D
[1:50:05] <s1rcuit> the squeaks prevent being spooped
[1:50:08] <blakeout> How's the game so far?
[1:50:11] <pk_piss> id really like the game to set up at least a little tension or uneasiness

[1:51:22] <%crimsonharvest> I experience frequent dissociation and this seeing yourself twice at once is kind of freaking me out lol

[1:51:39] <Cactuskris> goes to light
[1:51:40] <ittla> if i see a death's head moth, i'm tapping out
[1:51:40] <GarbageQueenEllie> @s1rcuit lol what did Harry Potter do to you?
[1:51:40] <%Broand> oh no it's a moth, the worst butterfly
[1:51:41] <Dragon_Batman> Interesting it's a moth and not a butterfly
[1:51:41] <+HalcyonNineThousand> not butterfly
[1:51:42] <%redthebaron> @TheAntiNihilist there is an implied ghost shield on the controls

[1:52:03] <$Hzealot> u playing silksong when its out?
[1:52:04] <mike2hands> use your spirit shield
[1:52:06] <blakeout> spirit shield implies you have a spirit gun
[1:52:06] <DracaenaLeaf> we did :)
[1:52:06] <+GenesisKnight> LUL
[1:52:08] <+HeroSolaire> that is very silent hill esque
[1:52:11] <lazerscraper> ROYAL GUARD
[1:52:11] <TheAntiNihilist> @redthebaron is that it?
[1:52:12] <Djinnazz> oh my GOOOOOOD
[1:52:14] <Srthunda> spirit shield that she did not even know about
[1:52:17] <s1rcuit> @GarbageQueenEllie nothing, he didn't earn ANYTHING that was given to him
[1:52:18] <servicesuspension> that looks really silly, the more detailed the graphics of survival horror, the dumbest it looks
[1:52:19] <%logoth_> That's a neat idea
[1:52:22] <stanlychicken> When's spirit gun?
[1:52:23] <+Grayhammatter> a juice
[1:52:24] <silverira> that looks so dumb omg
[1:52:25] <+Shady_Zaku> SPIRIT SHOTGUUUUN!
[1:52:25] <+HalcyonNineThousand> that was straight out of Harry potter
[1:52:29] <%logoth_> Meet sadness
[1:52:34] <waffleandman> im never getting used to this split screen
[1:52:34] <%SirGO0SE> i have a key made of flesh :)
[1:52:36] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is there a juice-meter covered by the web-cam?
[1:52:38] <%Arweynn> geiger key
[1:52:38] <%Monkeyweed21> this game would be hilarious if you could only see the regular side
[1:52:40] <pk_piss> it feels lame how nonchalantly she reacts to magical powers and ghost children
[1:52:44] <KaiserMario> Flesh and sinew, one could say...
[1:52:47] <%chiazam> go back
[1:52:47] <%redthebaron> yeah @TheAntiNihilist it seems no combat is a good guess
[1:52:49] <chronoxgp> learned a thing or two from david cage
[1:52:51] <%Starotter70> Nice Flesh door
[1:52:53] <Giztech> i really hope they do something like a person attacks you when doing this outer body thing
[1:52:57] <marrowjuice> eat it
[1:52:57] <%BoxNavy> no its flesh
[1:52:58] <Laecerelius> It even has a little sad face on it
[1:52:58] <TheViltsuZ> The artwork is by Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, not Geiger or Harry Potter.
[1:52:58] <$HairballCT> moisturize me
[1:52:58] <+storebrandcandy> better eat your way through
[1:53:00] <GarbageQueenEllie> @s1rcuit Yeah I always thought the world itself was more interesting than the main character. real RPG potential
[1:53:02] <+HeroSolaire> Like Siren Blood Curse has a better split screen mechanic
[1:53:04] <+Veraverse> Yum
[1:53:05] <%Romuken> get that KNOIF
[1:53:06] <$Afterman_> rip that butthole flap open
[1:53:07] <+GenesisKnight> That's not a knoife
[1:53:08] <%rbakervv> @pk_piss shes been doing this her entire life
[1:53:08] <s1rcuit> @pk_piss she's been dealing with this shit since childhood

[1:53:24] <%Romuken> the KNYOIIIF
[1:53:24] <%Starotter70> mmmmm
[1:53:27] <%Starotter70> Don't like that
[1:53:29] <%Taisuru> MOTHS, THE EVIL BUTTERFLY
[1:53:30] <Dragon_Batman> Which I'm shure you'll find in the normal world
[1:53:31] <Zeif00> That's a Beksinski looking ass key
[1:53:33] <allanmiri> @pk_piss She's apparently been talking to ghosts since she was a kid so she's probably use to it.
[1:53:34] <%Aeoneth> I wonder how this would play in VR
[1:53:36] <s1rcuit> @GarbageQueenEllie yeah, I liked the old Harry Potter games, but they could've been much better
[1:53:36] <TheAntiNihilist> @herosolaire OH GOD I hope Pat either finishes this quickly or gives up and goes and plays Siren
[1:53:38] <%topendbuzza> turn down bugs game
[1:53:42] <+professormorrigan> spirit bugz
[1:53:48] <+Grayhammatter> mmmmm, don't like that
[1:53:50] <marrowjuice> wait. can she only see the ghost dimension right now?
[1:53:52] <+takutoots> there was a hole her
[1:53:53] <The_500lb_Child> Clearly she is a mime
[1:53:53] <bigshedman> Imagine this game in VR with 2 different screens projected on your left and right eyes
[1:53:53] <+HeroSolaire> Is there even enemies in the real world?
[1:53:55] <+LazyBumNetwork> The art is cool, but the feel of the writing and gameplay don‚Äôt.. do it justice.
[1:53:55] <MyNameIsRasus> UwU
[1:53:56] <waffleandman> i hat this gimick so much
[1:54:05] <%Taisuru> @marrowjuice No, both
[1:54:08] <%Dunmarkh> @marrowjuice always sees both
[1:54:09] <Uselesswhitenoise> I love this gimmick
[1:54:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> @s1rcuit If they didn't treat the mobile game like a RobinHood app, I would've been all over it.

[1:54:38] <%topendbuzza> it's thd dog cat code pat
[1:54:39] <biomegabear> @LazyBumNetwork its sucks because its clear they like silent hill and played the games but it just that yeah which hurts
[1:54:40] <%orcstr16> I just got here gang. How's the game?
[1:54:40] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> psaGib
[1:54:43] <pk_piss> @lazybumnetwork i agree, the writing really kills the atmosphere. especially the constant narration
[1:54:45] <allanmiri> Ghost audio log!

[1:55:07] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Yes.
[1:55:07] <RaidenRising> sup troy
[1:55:08] <s1rcuit> @GarbageQueenEllie like Harry and Malfoy annoy me so much in that franchise because neither of them have any interest in learning magic shit, even though the more you know in that world the more literal power you have
[1:55:11] <Arek_1> Say yes ONE MORE TIME! SwiftRage
[1:55:11] <+Veraverse> Btw, Troy Baker is the monster!

[1:55:54] <marrowjuice> i bet you could do some cool scares with a split screen gimmick
[1:56:02] <ittla> main character tells the audience the emotions they should feel
[1:56:02] <Sunstalker> I stand with gief kinamaMad
[1:56:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> @s1rcuit It's a pitiful rivalry at best. Like, rivals are supposed to keep each other sharp and stuff.
[1:56:06] <+snausages_> played some of this, pretty much seems like a walking sim with a silent hill soundtrack
[1:56:07] <+HeroSolaire> Im not sure why they mixed magic shit with Silent Hill otherworld esque
[1:56:08] <%Taisuru> PAt...
[1:56:13] <%Taisuru> You're supposed to dive
[1:56:14] <@SoFarFetched> Pat did you miss what she said? LUL
[1:56:20] <%Romuken> looks like you need to get OUT OF BODY
[1:56:22] <+LazyBumNetwork> Honestly... if they didn‚Äôt split the screen and zoomed the camera in a little more I might like the visuals?
[1:56:23] <+Grayhammatter> D:
[1:56:29] <%toolofparanoia> @rytisone Triangle girl iss CRAZY HOT

[1:56:46] <blakeout> Oh Mr. Tartovsky
[1:56:48] <peachy996> This is like a bizarre mix of Silent Hill and Beyond Two Souls

[1:57:47] <%linSP> An actually pig would be less piglike than gief
[1:57:47] <TheViltsuZ> @KennySD Nah, Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski's art is amazing.
[1:57:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> just cure all that sad juice with electricity
[1:57:57] <%orcstr16> The electroshock is such an awful way to cure someone. Who actually believed that shooting some electricity through someone was a good idea?
[1:58:05] <+LazyBumNetwork> Hey so what are we doing here again, chat?
[1:58:07] <BoxNavy> pigs arent even that gross
[1:58:08] <s1rcuit> @GarbageQueenEllie imo Fantastic Beasts (the first one, haven't seen the 2nd) was way more interesting, and the characters were better
[1:58:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Not feeling dapper, get in the zapper.
[1:58:14] <$Afterman_> if that was Piperazine thats for roundworm infections apparently?>

[2:00:37] <pk_piss> the writing is killing it for me so bad it's actually making ne sad
[2:00:37] <%Sotetsu> @s1rcuit That's too bad
[2:00:41] <+HeroSolaire> Outlast 2, Amnesia Rebirth, The Medium, Evil Within, why the protagonists dont shut up?
[2:00:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Got no chill? Knock back a pill
[2:00:43] <peachy996> the butterknife of oopsie doo
[2:00:44] <%Manjove> too much gameplay for a David Cage game
[2:00:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> @HeroSolaire How else are you supposed to understand all the symbolisms

[2:01:32] <servicesuspension> every time I see the magic I can only think

[2:01:48] <rjhascancer> rude
[2:01:48] <s1rcuit> @IHATREID if this videogame goes higher than 30fps it'll explode
[2:01:49] <%lockhead45> Has there been any chase/combat scenes yet? I just rejoined since the start
[2:01:50] <+Grayhammatter> D:
[2:01:50] <BlkFlameKami> cut the goblins out
[2:01:51] <SaltyAzteca> D:
[2:01:53] <peachy996> at least you got a skip dialogue option
[2:01:53] <%SirGO0SE> D:
[2:01:55] <+HeroSolaire> Its really silly the protagonist reminds me of the Bloodstained protagonist
[2:01:58] <servicesuspension> oh no it's my dad D:
[2:01:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @SirGO0SE what happens if you poo while out of body?
[2:01:59] <+Veraverse> Damn....
[2:02:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> Sounds like he needs that guilt razor
[2:02:02] <+LazyBumNetwork> So do the writers/designs think were really that stupid, or are they that unaware how bad their use of symbolism is?
[2:02:05] <s1rcuit> @lockhead45 not yet
[2:02:08] <+Veraverse> BibleThump
[2:02:09] <%toastybites> Is this just Constantine without the sick fights
[2:02:10] <+HeroSolaire> The white mirror

[2:02:14] <+HeroSolaire> spooky
[2:02:16] <SaltyAzteca> S(REDATCED)
[2:02:17] <%SirGO0SE> @Monkeyweed21 Thonk
[2:02:20] <%dekkitout> @LazyBumNetwork Yes
[2:02:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Monkeyweed21 you poo for real
[2:02:27] <+HeroSolaire> is that a poop bucket
[2:02:28] <%Taisuru> So when does gameplay happen?
[2:02:28] <%anticrust> Thats why you need to kill your soul first
[2:02:29] <+HalcyonNineThousand> @monkeyweed21 spirit blast poo out your ass
[2:02:31] <%Jaxnos> my balleyes are struggling to focus on a side of the screen
[2:02:32] <skyentombment> the mildly used toothbrush of the penitent
[2:02:32] <cherrycottontail> I wonder if that will come back up in this game about there being two of you
[2:02:34] <MrHeisenbird> Uh oh Pat‚Äôs leaning back. The game‚Äôs putting him to sleep.üåö
[2:02:47] <+takutoots> oh no
[2:02:50] <BlkFlameKami> yandere nurse
[2:02:52] <%chiazam> ummmmmmm
[2:02:53] <+captainspauldin> i dont trust that nurse
[2:02:55] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[2:02:56] <+HeroSolaire> Tarkowvsky poop bucket
[2:02:56] <servicesuspension> the otherworld is actually pretty charming
[2:02:57] <%transporterthesequel> Oh she is 100% going to die before this game ends
[2:02:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> That bitch is a Murder Nurse. I seen those on the ID channel

[2:03:03] <%chiazam> wonder how that happened
[2:03:03] <mr_saturday93> she doesn't!?
[2:03:03] <Dragon_Batman> If they weren't still in your body
[2:03:05] <servicesuspension> COLOSTOMY
[2:03:06] <@SoFarFetched> what do you mean if
[2:03:06] <bigshedman> you'd enjoy it Pat don't lie
[2:03:10] <sydowoodo> doesn't she already do that?
[2:03:10] <%snugglepuggs> but she already does
[2:03:13] <%SirGO0SE> says man who poops in diaper
[2:03:13] <%BoxNavy> i would rather die that have someone bare that cross
[2:03:16] <%NovaKnightmare> PAIGE IF YOURE READING THIS MAKE PAT SHIT HIS PANTS LIVE
[2:03:18] <peachy996> what if you had to clean the poops from paige
[2:03:18] <+Veraverse> >if
[2:03:19] <%anticrust> WOuld you clean up hers? @PatStaresAt
[2:03:23] <theanora1> I thought you hated cleaning your own poopies?
[2:03:25] <allanmiri> Okay I'll say again, the game is kinda interesting, but not scary at all. It's lacking something for me.
[2:03:27] <MrBaldachin> WHY DID SHE NEED TO SAY THAT
[2:03:31] <skyentombment> GOING NUTZZZZZ
[2:03:32] <pk_piss> The 1984 "Psychic Shit" Incident
[2:03:34] <+LazyBumNetwork> @novaknightmare LUL
[2:03:35] <+takutoots> moth madness
[2:03:38] <%anticrust> boge
[2:03:40] <%Romuken> Wait pat, what if the spirit's pendant is a moth?
[2:03:42] <%dekkitout> Those moths have a taste for human flesh D:
[2:03:46] <%Sotetsu> Paige is an expert dealing with your shit. psaDab
[2:03:46] <MrBaldachin> the narration is ruining this LUL
[2:03:47] <+Veraverse> Moths on fire!
[2:03:49] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:03:50] <Sapphire_Breeze> medium left
[2:03:58] <Dalonomus> D:
[2:04:00] <%chiazam> This is a new area Pat
[2:04:00] <+GenesisKnight> the hell
[2:04:05] <+thefishofwar> jumped down a floor
[2:04:07] <+HeroSolaire> medium these nuts
[2:04:07] <s1rcuit> @allanmiri that thing is probably urgency, that's how is for me, I can barely remember why we're here
[2:04:08] <+LazyBumNetwork> Too bad you have an invincible button. Stupid moths.
[2:04:11] <TheViltsuZ> @allanmiri Have you considered that watching a Twitch stream might take a bit out of the scare factor? And the streamer constantly babbling?
[2:04:17] <%MoguManda> medium raw
[2:04:18] <Uselesswhitenoise> how come otherworlds are always messed up and ruined, why there never a otherworld that is like way better than the real world
[2:04:20] <%Starotter70> Smrt
[2:04:22] <servicesuspension> remove the narration and the devil trigger and it'd be a little creepier
[2:04:23] <+HalcyonNineThousand> this game is for chameleons
[2:04:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I like moths, I think they're kinda cute :)
[2:04:26] <%BoxNavy> this game refuses to let you think for yourself and infer things
[2:04:27] <%Sotetsu> Nice camera angles
[2:04:32] <Arek_1> @LazyBumNetwork I think it's a problem between non-writers/designers and subtlety. I think they feel that if a subject is too subtle and the player won't pick up on it, then it's a failure.
[2:04:36] <$Futurecity10> Just found out my Dentist got murdered in a house robbery
[2:04:36] <SirBrawler18> This any interesting so far?
[2:04:40] <+LazyBumNetwork> Put spooky moths, but make sure they can‚Äôt really damage the players.
[2:04:44] <%chiazam> I also think Pat missed a room
[2:04:50] <servicesuspension> In Mawaru Penguindrum the otherworld is super colorful and pretty, and that makes it terrifying
[2:04:51] <allanmiri> @TheViltsuZ That and the fact that nothing scary has happened at all.
[2:04:51] <%Jaxnos> watching other you mime shit is funny
[2:04:52] <+gimmickypizza> wow
[2:04:54] <+HeroSolaire> @servicesuspension yeah and turn down the brightness by 50
[2:04:57] <+GenesisKnight> Shortcut activated
[2:05:00] <Dragon_Batman> I imagine having two different places working together might tank some performance if you wrun
[2:05:01] <+IrishWeegee> @futurecity10 holy shit
[2:05:02] <+Veraverse> Let the game load poor bastard
[2:05:04] <%SirGO0SE> @BoxNavy walking simulators have come so far üôÑ
[2:05:13] <%AdamElJefe> Hahaha, that's such a funny story Mark riffHaHa riffHaHa
[2:05:15] <+HeroSolaire> time for another snarky comment
[2:05:15] <+LokimenD> fuck you is january!
[2:05:16] <+HalcyonNineThousand> they have to load two areas at once, your pc would die if you moved faster
[2:05:17] <%Sotetsu> I kind of don't like the two screens. it makes it hard to focus on either environment.
[2:05:18] <TheViltsuZ> @allanmiri You need jumpscares?
[2:05:19] <$Futurecity10> Yeah shits crazy
[2:05:23] <+zsDirtyHarry> V
[2:05:24] <%Jaxnos> oh yeah, that's satisfying
[2:05:30] <+gimmickypizza> do you get twice the achievements
[2:05:35] <chronoxgp> locust
[2:05:36] <SirBrawler18> That is some Silent Hill looking flesh
[2:05:39] <+Veraverse> Oddly long animation, but okay
[2:05:40] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> ‚ÄúAbout to get hit by mouths‚Äù?
[2:05:44] <%chiazam> When do you run out of JUICE?
[2:05:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Moths? Don't you mean evil butterflys
[2:05:48] <+HeroSolaire> If you stare at the left screen the game looks very stupid
[2:05:53] <allanmiri> @Futurecity10 NOt jumpscares just a feeling of dreed that this game lacks or an actual threat other than moths.
[2:05:55] <Uselesswhitenoise> gotta find green herbs
[2:05:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's so disappointing that those just disappear after teasing the floppy flesh door physics
[2:06:01] <%king_wragles> This game would look so much better if it wasn't both sides at the same time
[2:06:16] <+GenesisKnight> Oh! They turned a fort into a resort.
[2:06:21] <s1rcuit> get fucked Hitler
[2:06:22] <%G_Thunders> I liked how Dishonored 2 did the side-by-side screens thing since your character was only in one or the other
[2:06:26] <waffleandman> i dont understand why people like this gimmick
[2:06:31] <LoudmicRPG> "heroic" red army
[2:06:39] <MyNameIsRasus> oh shit this was a WW2 site, it's super haunted
[2:06:45] <Arek_1> "Heroic."
[2:06:45] <+GenesisKnight> There's probably some old ass WW2 ghosts in there
[2:06:50] <filialpails> killing nazis is super heroic actually
[2:06:56] <servicesuspension> One thing I liked about the first 2 silent hills is that they kept the magic shit invisible, you rarely saw stuff transform or glow with mysticity. The Harry Potter shit is truly killing it
[2:07:01] <%orcstr16> So, uh, this game seems like it has some potential, but man that writing sucks.
[2:07:02] <+LazyBumNetwork> @king_wragles literally take the spirit realm environment and real realm protagonist without white hair and I‚Äôd like this game 2x more.
[2:07:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> Plz stop
[2:07:11] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[2:07:11] <+captainspauldin> creepy little girl
[2:07:12] <+storebrandcandy> Hey Sad, can I call you Sad?
[2:07:15] <Freezerhorse> weeeeird
[2:07:15] <+Veraverse> Inside Out looks way different from what I remember
[2:07:15] <%Livelinne> aww
[2:07:17] <Zebroneath> that's horrible
[2:07:20] <%Sotetsu> She is very light-hearted for all the horror
[2:07:20] <+LokimenD> ResidentSleeper

[2:07:23] <maskedmook> this lady weird
[2:07:26] <%SirGO0SE> cringe is the new horror
[2:07:26] <+captainspauldin> good one marianne
[2:07:28] <+HeroSolaire> ResidentSleeper
[2:07:30] <%chiazam> Uh oh Sad was getting kind of aggro there
[2:07:31] <MyNameIsRasus> is there no lip sync?
[2:07:32] <%toolofparanoia> oh you can see her ribs
[2:07:33] <%crimsonharvest> Is a visual representation of the theraputic practice of parenting your young self?
[2:07:34] <peachy996> I think it's a nice touch she's trying to be friendly to creepy ghost girl
[2:07:37] <%anticrust> I like her gross arm hole
[2:07:41] <peachy996> You don't see that a lot
[2:07:41] <skyentombment> her lip flappers are dark souls esque
[2:07:45] <SirBrawler18> Wow. I apparently missed a lot
[2:07:49] <servicesuspension> yeah that one was cringy but also pretty realistic
[2:07:53] <+HeroSolaire> THis animations are really bad
[2:07:55] <allanmiri> @TheViltsuZ Whoops replied to the wrong guy. I don't need jumpscares just a feeling of dreed or an actual threat both of which this game lacks so far other than moths.
[2:07:58] <+Veraverse> Again, the music is really goof
[2:08:00] <%SirGO0SE> @SirBrawler18 less than youd think
[2:08:02] <+Veraverse> good*
[2:08:04] <%Sotetsu> @anticrust sipsipRude

[2:08:22] <%toolofparanoia> she speakin facts
[2:08:22] <+nirvana227> lmaooo
[2:08:25] <servicesuspension> would this game be better if it had PS2 graphics
[2:08:29] <+HeroSolaire> haHAA this is actually life is strange levels
[2:08:30] <+zsDirtyHarry> She bailed
[2:08:31] <%LymanAl> spook time
[2:08:36] <+LazyBumNetwork> The music is like a really good sauce for a super dry old steak.
[2:08:37] <orpleborple> how people see kids nowadays
[2:08:37] <+HeroSolaire> @servicesuspension yes
[2:08:39] <MyNameIsRasus> that's the first time i've seen a character treat the haunt child nicely

[2:08:50] <servicesuspension> IMPRISONIG ME
[2:08:50] <chronoxgp> uses double the memory to render two worlds
[2:08:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> it's the tetanus, Pat
[2:08:53] <%king_wragles> It was always like that, probably from the accident?
[2:08:57] <%AdamElJefe> OH LOOK A BUTTERFLY
[2:08:57] <+vicar_anat> symbolic!
[2:08:59] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, cause you didn't have the juice
[2:09:00] <LoudmicRPG> @HeroSolaire Allright lets not get ahead of ourselves now
[2:09:04] <%chiazam> Can you not focus on the Material World only now?
[2:09:15] <+Veraverse> @sotetsu you would not believe...
[2:09:16] <+Shady_Zaku> RUH ROH RAGGY
[2:09:17] <+GenesisKnight> Uh oh

[2:10:16] <%Broand> MOLD EVIl
[2:10:18] <praisedasun_> is this thing decent, im just seeing people talk about performance and not the content
[2:10:19] <ittla> it sure would be nice if you could gather your own feelings from the design of the nightmare areas
[2:10:23] <%Sargonyx> lot of puzzles so far are just screaming "break the glass"
[2:10:23] <%Romuken> was that michael scott
[2:10:24] <Dalonomus> secretariat boys
[2:10:28] <%AdamElJefe> $20 says there's a hidden lab under it
[2:10:44] <ittla> explaining emotions to you kinda defeats the purpose of art
[2:10:45] <SirBrawler18> That map is eerily similar to Brookhaven Hospitals
[2:10:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Visual and sound design should show you the feels
[2:10:48] <pennykettle_> I can't believe im buying fucking gamestop and dogecoin shares and I've never bought stocks before
[2:10:50] <Dragon_Batman> @praisedasun_ So far it seems pretty good

[2:14:09] <%G_Thunders> This game is making me really appreciative that RE characters never comment on the random bullshit and clues they pick up
[2:14:10] <Dragon_Batman> Makes sense
[2:14:10] <marrowjuice> i've actually never seen a clip-on flashlight irl
[2:14:11] <+LazyBumNetwork> @animecupz as a horror game? Yes...?

[2:14:59] <+Veraverse> WHY IS SHE NARRATING THIS?
[2:15:07] <+HalcyonNineThousand> This game is going to be on ‚ÄúWha happun?‚Äù eventually
[2:15:07] <%topendbuzza> sure you have
[2:15:20] <dukenux> do you think Maryanne is addicted to ghost juice
[2:15:30] <waffleandman> as i was narrating i realized i was ruining the game for everyone
[2:15:31] <+Grayhammatter> thanks thom
[2:15:34] <+CatsEyeBlind> "Yeah I just rewound time in a separate reality, thursdays am I right?"
[2:15:36] <dukenux> cause she sounded really eager to get to that fountain
[2:15:37] <Katorskay> that's not a lot of juice
[2:15:40] <+Grayhammatter> one whole juice
[2:15:45] <%BoxNavy> vape that juice
[2:15:57] <lazerscraper> guess is: thomas lost a loved one, did the blood magics to be with them again
[2:16:04] <lazerscraper> Just guessing
[2:16:07] <allanmiri> Unless the game introduces an actual threat to the player this feels more like a supernatural drama instead of a horror game. Which is fine, but eh.
[2:16:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> If there was like 50% less narration this would be more enjoyable
[2:16:12] <servicesuspension> the whole place is a ghost juice farm
[2:16:17] <+waltzqueen> blood magic sounds legit
[2:16:19] <%Broand> no.. don't do it! it's... too vague!
[2:16:20] <%Undenizen> do you really wanna do this in reverse order?
[2:16:23] <ittla> wouldnt you want to not turn time backwards to examine them in order
[2:16:23] <KasiCrafter> In order? I thought the clock was getting turned back?
[2:16:30] <servicesuspension> some enemies would be nice
[2:16:36] <%dekkitout> Remember kids, hemomancy is badass
[2:16:38] <Uselesswhitenoise> dog rebels agianst towle
[2:16:52] <+LazyBumNetwork> The only thing that would bring me back is sudden Cthulhu.
[2:17:03] <Dragon_Batman> He needs the cold floor to feel alive
[2:17:07] <dukenux> you say you want more combat, but i feel like the combat system might be dogshit
[2:17:19] <%Undenizen> Imagine how crazy this lady looks if you can only see the left side of the screen
[2:17:25] <Uselesswhitenoise> just get good at death magic dude
[2:17:26] <+Veraverse> @lazybumnetwork ...The game has you kinda covered
[2:17:28] <servicesuspension> silent hill's combat was also dogshit tbf
[2:17:28] <%orcstr16> This game would be infinitely cooler without the narration explaining the game to you. Games like this are built on the mystery and intrigue that comes from trying to piece out what things represent and mean. It has a bit of that, but the narration destroys that intrigue somewhat. It might still be super cool underneath that though. It's a bit hard to tell.
[2:17:32] <%Dunmarkh> @dukenux just like real silent hill
[2:17:50] <allanmiri> @dukenux You may be right, but... yeah.
[2:18:02] <lazerscraper> EVIL SHIT
[2:18:07] <+LazyBumNetwork> @undenizen oh no... I was joking. JOKING NotLikeThis
[2:18:10] <blakeout> meanwhile I paid $15 for darkwood and I'm loving it
[2:18:18] <+waltzqueen> @orcstr16 i agree, the narration is a con not a pro
[2:18:34] <+HeroSolaire> I wonder if there is even 1 scary sequence in this game
[2:18:40] <+keatiestofthegribbles> so this is lorraine warren the game?
[2:18:43] <+Veraverse> Again, I dig the music...
[2:18:44] <dukenux> @blakeout i need to get my hands on it
[2:18:48] <%BinaryFireball> so is most of the gameplay room exploration/puzzles?
[2:18:49] <%chiazam> It's a hidden passage
[2:18:57] <blakeout> Does anyone know if Pat ever finished a playthrough of darkwood?
[2:19:02] <%Undenizen> @LazyBumNetwork i have been asleep for an hour so i dunno if i said something dumb

[2:22:15] <+HeroSolaire> This game really looks like its made by Dontnod
[2:22:16] <%crimsonharvest> This game is doing a lot of work to translate coping into a 3d environment it reads like a psych 101 text

[2:22:48] <+LazyBumNetwork> Ghost tray
[2:22:54] <allanmiri> The narration wouldn't be bad if she just talked about something when you click on an object like classic RE, but she does so much. I feel like the writer either didn't have confidence in themselves or their players.
[2:22:55] <DracaenaLeaf> This is sadness :)

[2:27:21] <marrowjuice> that voice does not match the design
[2:27:21] <+smuggleruncle> the confusion will go MUCH HIGHER later
[2:27:23] <+LazyBumNetwork> It‚Äôs doing the Woolie fake demon noise.

[2:27:35] <%dekkitout> There is no escape from Evillak
[2:27:35] <Dragon_Batman> That was a sneaky teleport
[2:27:35] <%BestTeaMaker> oh that's why, he blindsides you from the other side
[2:27:36] <%king_wragles> That was supposed to be the known...
[2:27:36] <%SomeSageAdvice> he teleported
[2:27:40] <+MrTurtleThief> oh god. no. MrDestructoid
[2:27:42] <pennykettle_> So I'm hearing this game isn't great
[2:27:44] <+thickshield> this is way to calm for a demon chase
[2:27:44] <KaitlynnHere> He just really likes her style
[2:27:45] <blakeout> the voice isn't very intimidating
[2:27:47] <%Alazull> That doorway looked vaguely vaginal

[2:29:05] <KaitlynnHere> ‚ÄúI really like your boooooots‚Äù
[2:29:05] <%StaceMcGate> I wouldn't say this game is bad, just not impressive and obviously a low-budget title
[2:29:07] <%Starotter70> Did that camera freak out?
[2:29:07] <+cvp5127> ?
[2:29:09] <%chiazam> NOPE

[2:30:21] <+WutangchickeN> That isn't scary
[2:30:21] <+Shady_Zaku> LMFAO way to brute force it
[2:30:23] <%Livelinne> OhMyDog
[2:30:24] <Pookiedaexzile> So something new on Saturday?
[2:30:25] <%s_xylocalsingles> frustrated when he dies from Brute Forcing Stealth KEKW
[2:30:25] <servicesuspension> Pat's starting to break

[2:30:27] <+captainspauldin> this is literslly the easiest part
[2:30:28] <%PanicSwytch> He had trouble walking in the environment
[2:30:31] <+Shadygamer31> almost as bad as your stealth skills pat, like what the heck lol
[2:30:31] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:30:32] <skyentombment> Tip: Don't let him see you
[2:30:36] <%s_xylocalsingles> psa3guy
[2:30:36] <%Fyre_link> I've been here for 5 minutes, but this game looks like it kinda sucks tbh
[2:30:41] <%linSP> you know what is scary
[2:30:41] <+strakillias> You gonna be playin Kotor 2 on Saturday?
[2:30:41] <clockworkidiot> roomba devil
[2:30:41] <KasiCrafter> That scariest of all: Game Over screens
[2:30:43] <waffleandman> this looks so bad its like it doesnt know if it wants to be horror
[2:30:48] <SaltyAzteca> HOR ROR
[2:30:49] <+ScatterCatt> This enemy would be scarier if he didn't talk or growl.
[2:30:49] <%BoxNavy> what are you gonna stream on saturday pat? :)
[2:30:49] <allanmiri> ME TOO!
[2:30:53] <Profmcstevie> Against his will, yes he has
[2:30:56] <KaitlynnHere> Girl, your skin is so smooth! What‚Äôs your skincare plan? I gotta know!
[2:30:58] <+Veraverse> *I sleep*
[2:31:00] <%crimsonharvest> This has the feel of a PS2 era janktrip
[2:31:03] <%ArchimerCXV> wait this is supposed to be horror?
[2:31:05] <%thomassolorio> this game is da poopoo
[2:31:06] <Decarcassor> This is supposed to be horror ? Because the tone is completly off. :/
[2:31:08] <%slaughtedlamb> wtf is this trash
[2:31:11] <+HalcyonNineThousand> It‚Äôs scary how bad it is
[2:31:12] <%Mr_Pylon> This feels like an incredibly powerful underwhelming time
[2:31:13] <pennykettle_> Would children be afraid by this
[2:31:14] <BonesandMuses> because... it sucks LUL
[2:31:17] <allanmiri> YEs. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:31:18] <ralphfromdk> It's.... HORRORible..... LUL
[2:31:19] <+smuggleruncle> this is one of the most boring games ever
[2:31:20] <%BoxNavy> YOUR CHARACTER IS CHIPPER THROUGH THE WHOLE THING
[2:31:21] <MrBaldachin> there's way too much tonal inconsistency for you to feel tense
[2:31:21] <%BinaryFireball> curiosity?
[2:31:22] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Eurojank
[2:31:22] <bleugh> it's a boreor game
[2:31:25] <redrins> it invokes boredom
[2:31:26] <+gimmickypizza> if you buy it you'll be horrified
[2:31:26] <%Valdorick> Its just... weird...
[2:31:27] <+thickshield> i would call that monster a ... spoop. as it comes no where close to spooky
[2:31:29] <DracaenaLeaf> Like a lesser Alan wake mixed with Control
[2:31:29] <skyentombment> Pat cares not
[2:31:29] <%Dunmarkh> but spooky jumpscares tho
[2:31:30] <TheViltsuZ> YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR LIGHTS ON AND CONSTANTLY READING THE CHAT.
[2:31:30] <+WutangchickeN> This evokes Boredom
[2:31:31] <rjhascancer> well THIS part sucks for sure
[2:31:32] <+HeroSolaire> Its stapled "psychological horror" in the wikipedia tho
[2:31:34] <%crimsonharvest> the apprehension is 'how will it make me repeat a segment next'
[2:31:34] <%thomassolorio> it invokes da poopoo
[2:31:35] <servicesuspension> it's a walk in the park
[2:31:36] <%Livelinne> Skawyy muusic
[2:31:37] <%Starotter70> It feels like stock horror game
[2:31:37] <SpaceGuntank> its a little lame, but thats just my opinion.
[2:31:38] <allanmiri> This guy is a threat, but he's too little too late.
[2:31:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Its spooky
[2:31:38] <KaitlynnHere> Hore ore
[2:31:39] <+PleasantLee> giant bug satan just said he wants to wear you.....
[2:31:42] <+gespenst25> Does it invilve "eww"
[2:31:45] <Noogiez> some would say its right in the middle
[2:31:46] <servicesuspension> At least it could have gone for a Swery vibe
[2:31:46] <%SirGO0SE> if the character isnt afraid you wont be
[2:31:53] <+gimmickypizza> if you play on console you'll be horrified by the FPS
[2:31:54] <Pookiedaexzile> We know when the Threat is
[2:31:55] <TheViltsuZ> YOU'RE PLAYING WITH YOUR LIGHTS ON AND CONSTANTLY READING THE CHAT
[2:31:56] <%anticrust> Quoting from a pair of idiots "This isn't survival horror" "Oh yeah, well its horrible and you're surviving it"
[2:31:59] <AllonBachuth> @bleugh that's on the nose brilliant
[2:32:02] <KaitlynnHere> @pleasantlee your clothes!
[2:32:05] <+HalcyonNineThousand> The character is bored
[2:32:12] <%ArchimerCXV> it looks like a nice reference on the CV for the art team
[2:32:14] <%king_wragles> It looks like there's at least effort in this game, but given the developer's history I have no idea if it's all THEIR effort. Ya know?
[2:32:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Hey @PatStaresAt and Chat, i made 10k on GME yesterday and then bought in on their orchestrated driop today to milk them for more tomorrow, how ya'll doing?
[2:32:15] <tacoisgoods> So like Shattered Memories?
[2:32:17] <%SirGO0SE> @anticrust +2 LUL
[2:32:24] <+Naey_Naey> Resident Evil counts as horror and those aren't scary/spooky either
[2:32:26] <%Jaxnos> so it's mainly because it's easy eurojank
[2:32:27] <MrBaldachin> she's so flippant
[2:32:28] <%abakkus> the worst threat is "you will fail this autofail mechanic and the enemy will do a growly at you" and the tension build-up isn't there to make that actually be worth anything
[2:32:29] <%topendbuzza> she sure does
[2:32:29] <servicesuspension> YEAH
[2:32:29] <%BoxNavy> @TheViltsuZ even if he werent doing these things he would not be afraid i promise you this
[2:32:31] <%arcielardor> IT'S CALLED MEDIUM BECAUSE IT'S NOT RARE AND IT'S NOT WELL DONE!
[2:32:31] <+Veraverse> Imagine Leon narrating a puzzle in RE2
[2:32:35] <Profmcstevie> She sounds bored
[2:32:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Nice egg form dude
[2:32:37] <peachy996> It's like a Ghostbusters
[2:32:38] <+HalcyonNineThousand> BUT THE CAMERA ANGLES
[2:32:42] <Cactuskris> like isaac in dead space 2
[2:32:43] <peachy996> "Stop talking"
[2:32:43] <+cvp5127> whatevs
[2:32:45] <%Undenizen> Horror doesn't equal to scary. Genre is to do with themes, not emotion.
[2:32:45] <SomersaultJustice> A the medium
[2:32:46] <falsecrabmeat> As bad as this scene is, I think the dialogue is the worst aspect so far
[2:32:50] <pennykettle_> I prefer my women medium large
[2:32:50] <%Starotter70> She snarks about it
[2:32:51] <+ThomasOfTroy> "Let me try you on," Satan needs to be less thirsty, god damn
[2:32:51] <@SoFarFetched> @TheViltsuZ I mean we've seen pat get spooked in a game while streaming.
[2:32:55] <KaitlynnHere> She‚Äôs been smoking dat dank weed bro
[2:32:56] <auraoftheearth009> This is what some developers believe is horror
[2:32:56] <servicesuspension> main character is also really boring
[2:32:58] <%BoxNavy> its so frustrating
[2:33:01] <%BinaryFireball> witcher lady
[2:33:01] <NadaPlays> So is this bad? I just came in
[2:33:03] <Profmcstevie> She has no healthy respect for the threat of the scenario, experienced or not
[2:33:04] <s1rcuit> @arcielardor got'em
[2:33:09] <servicesuspension> like, she's like an even less energetic Jessie
[2:33:10] <+Double_Tap_That> James is pretty laid back tho
[2:33:13] <Dragon_Batman> I think a part of it is that her character has lived her life with this
[2:33:15] <%BoxNavy> oh for sure
[2:33:16] <%thomassolorio> this shit is wack
[2:33:17] <rufus2k2> how's the music
[2:33:17] <%Starotter70> The narration hurts it a lot
[2:33:26] <servicesuspension> James is not laid back, he's resigned
[2:33:27] <%abakkus> and also if she didnt have mannequinface
[2:33:28] <+DragonArt07> It reminds me of Beyond Two Souls
[2:33:28] <%Livelinne> Ye
[2:33:30] <%BoxNavy> YEP
[2:33:32] <+Veraverse> She makes puns also
[2:33:33] <blakeout> When people see freaky shit they should actually freak
[2:33:33] <%Starotter70> LUL
[2:33:34] <$Futurecity10> yeah this game sucks
[2:33:34] <Uselesswhitenoise> horror game wirten by john whendon
[2:33:34] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[2:33:34] <%AdamElJefe> LUL
[2:33:35] <MrBaldachin> it sounds like they recorded a lot of her dialogue for a lara croft game then swapped to this style instead
[2:33:37] <Karebuncle> @Double_Tap_That james isnt laid back, he's fucking wierd
[2:33:37] <+gimmickypizza> be horrified if I bought a series X for this
[2:33:37] <+zzNamttamzz> Shes also Polish
[2:33:38] <%debugdrawray_> AHAHAH
[2:33:38] <+takutoots> LUL
[2:33:38] <%Starotter70> Perfect
[2:33:41] <Pookiedaexzile> This game would be spoopier if the game didn't cut up the action into action spaces
[2:33:42] <%BoxNavy> DONT HAVE YOUR CHARACTER TALK WHEN TEHY DONT NEED TO
[2:33:42] <+Shady_Zaku> vargLUL vargLUL vargLUL vargLUL
[2:33:43] <Cactuskris> she wasnt chill about it though
[2:33:43] <%s_xylocalsingles> Pat looking at chat for validation KEKW
[2:33:43] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:33:44] <SaltyAzteca> its too obvious
[2:33:44] <%Sotetsu> fmgS
[2:33:45] <peachy996> @Veraverse Yeah but I seem to recall Claire, Jill or leon wouldn't shut the hell up in their remakes
[2:33:46] <%ChrisPlaysThing> formulaic, you might say
[2:33:46] <iosephe> crazy talk requiem
[2:33:46] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[2:33:46] <+sonicitus> LUL
[2:33:46] <Dragon_Batman> That one line is fine tho
[2:33:46] <silverira> @PatStaresAt any interest in playing At the dead of night ?
[2:33:46] <+JesusFromSpace> @PatStaresAt wouldn't you say something to yourself though?
[2:33:48] <rufus2k2> Harry Mason getting shot at: Have you seen a little girl? 5 years old, short black hair
[2:33:50] <skyentombment> she's also doing this thing where her cursing doesn't sound natura
[2:33:51] <Meekest> @PatStaresAt This or Amnesia Rebirth?
[2:33:53] <%GarbageNirvana> literally calling it beat by beat
[2:33:54] <pennykettle_> Why isn't it splitscreen anymore
[2:33:54] <%Mr_Pylon> She sounds more baffled that the monster wanted to skin-suit her than anything else
[2:33:55] <KaitlynnHere> What the fuck was thaaaaaat
[2:33:55] <+sonicitus> Game bad
[2:33:55] <$8BitDsx> Modern games do this all the time; it's super annoying
[2:33:56] <Dragon_Batman> The rest I can give you
[2:33:56] <%thomassolorio> Hitler knew
[2:33:57] <%crimsonharvest> this isnt gameplay, what are they doing
[2:33:57] <%Livelinne> NotLikeThis
[2:33:58] <skyentombment> like Ethan in heavy rain
[2:33:58] <+pandan82588> Is this like spooky Detroit?
[2:33:58] <chronoxgp> sidle
[2:33:59] <%psidefx> It's Poland man waddaya want
[2:33:59] <+HalcyonNineThousand> What‚Äôs the developers name again?
[2:34:00] <%LymanAl> hand through wall
[2:34:00] <%chiazam> But don't RE characters talk A LOT as well?
[2:34:00] <SaltyAzteca> its trying TOO hard to be spoopy
[2:34:02] <%AllenDeadman> that's the most scared we've heard her all game
[2:34:04] <peachy996> Imagine if James was this chatty
[2:34:04] <Profmcstevie> James in Silent Hill is disturbed beyond belief, every engagement is tinged with discomfort
[2:34:06] <ralphfromdk> Pat, are you also a medium well done?
[2:34:06] <Dragon_Batman> It's like Heather saying that in 3
[2:34:07] <Pookiedaexzile> Danger spaces does a spoop not make
[2:34:08] <+Shady_Zaku> She should just shout KURWA at the ghosts
[2:34:09] <+justianxix> the game looks good at least
[2:34:09] <servicesuspension> she curses like she wants to impress
[2:34:10] <%ghostofsolomon> too much dialogue takes away the suspense
[2:34:11] <%AdamElJefe> What's real work her doing right now I wonder
[2:34:12] <%Livelinne> psaGiefrail psaGiefrail psaGiefrail
[2:34:16] <%BoxNavy> D:
[2:34:19] <+zsDirtyHarry> lul
[2:34:20] <%Jaxnos> this also doesn't help: taking the most tense moments out of your control
[2:34:20] <+Veraverse> F a l l
[2:34:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Also anything with ANY stakes at all seems like it's basically totally on rails
[2:34:23] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah I feel the character always going "WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT" to everything isn't too great.
[2:34:23] <%Dunmarkh> what's going on in the human world right now?
[2:34:25] <%Valdorick> ded
[2:34:25] <KaitlynnHere> Your sofa did nothing to you @patstaresat
[2:34:26] <%crimsonharvest> the bugs werent even going for her why cant she keep her hands under control
[2:34:26] <%BoxNavy> did she died
[2:34:27] <%debugdrawray_> oh my god
[2:34:29] <%Fyre_link> I do gotta give it a bit of credit though, theres no one else trying to make a fixed camera angle horror game in 2021. Too bad more devs won't take a risk going back to that like these guys will
[2:34:29] <servicesuspension> sad though, I really like the moths
[2:34:32] <%dekkitout> Strands! Man. psaSkelmo
[2:34:33] <auraoftheearth009> Kewl...
[2:34:33] <%Sotetsu> So did her real world self fall through the floor, or how does that work?
[2:34:36] <+Veraverse> This is kinda like a bad Control set up
[2:34:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Uncharted: But Sppopy
[2:34:39] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Her arm looks like the prince a Persia shit
[2:34:40] <peachy996> This is drama bordering on pretentiousness
[2:34:40] <%SirGO0SE> Pat's toilet after taco tuesday is scarier than this
[2:34:40] <%MisterRockett> I've always loved the idea of a horror protagonist who ruined the tone by reacting to things in a very human, almost kinda funny way.
[2:34:41] <+Veraverse> I want to replay Control now
[2:34:43] <KasiCrafter> Cutscenes and scripted events are also ANTI-scary.
[2:34:45] <%thomassolorio> did David cage consult on this
[2:34:48] <+gimmickypizza> no steaks or potatoes
[2:34:48] <rufus2k2> what is this animation
[2:34:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> got it, shie say herself die in another reality
[2:34:49] <%Valdorick> A fraction? A FRACTION!? DO YOU KNOW HOW FUCKING HUGE THE UNIVERSE IS LADY!? HOW HUGE THE PLANET FUCKING EARTH IS!?
[2:34:53] <+HeroSolaire> @HalcyonNineThousand yes I cant take that out of my mind
[2:34:54] <%LymanAl> Sabat cigarettes
[2:34:54] <%chiazam> And we're back here
[2:34:56] <%topendbuzza> uh huh sure
[2:34:58] <servicesuspension> The camera is good, the otherworld is ok (except the satan)
[2:34:59] <KaitlynnHere> See? She‚Äôs smoking that dank kush
[2:34:59] <Cactuskris> floeating cigaretts
[2:34:59] <%psidefx> Stress Lucky Strikes
[2:35:00] <+ThisIsLloyd> got those marlboro reds
[2:35:00] <Pookiedaexzile> We get it you can animate and the voice actor can act
[2:35:02] <+zsDirtyHarry> This game is boring
[2:35:03] <Profmcstevie> You know how in Resi 2 remake Leon would sometimes exclaim about zombies....but he'd do it from hour 1 to hour 10? Yeah don't do that
[2:35:03] <Meekest> This facial animation is uhhh
[2:35:04] <skyentombment> she's kinda pretty
[2:35:06] <%UvBenServed> Mind Break
[2:35:06] <%AllenDeadman> suuure hon
[2:35:07] <KaitlynnHere> She can‚Äôt help it
[2:35:07] <servicesuspension> moths are cool
[2:35:08] <ExpressNode> @patstaresat Wouldn't you say you feel like you're playing a horror movie instead of a horror game?
[2:35:08] <$Hzealot> her face is so familiar
[2:35:09] <%Starotter70> We can tell
[2:35:11] <%topendbuzza> hmm
[2:35:12] <%Livelinne> Bork
[2:35:14] <%AdamElJefe> ALSO, LIKE, MOUTH ANIMATION IS BAD
[2:35:15] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I‚Äôd break if I was on this QA team too
[2:35:17] <%thomassolorio> who is she expositing to
[2:35:18] <%ghostofsolomon> who is she talking to?
[2:35:20] <peachy996> Lip Syncing and facial animation is so oof
[2:35:22] <%Valdorick> "That thing... it scares me" - Heavy
[2:35:22] <servicesuspension> she's like claire fused with jessie
[2:35:23] <$Hzealot> she has a very bland face
[2:35:23] <+abrupt_abe> Who is she talking to
[2:35:23] <rafflespaddock> A Satan
[2:35:26] <+gimmickypizza> David Cage games at least keep you interested for the ride
[2:35:26] <TheOdyssean> she doesnt talk like somebody who sees things like that
[2:35:26] <iosephe> all of this animation is bad
[2:35:27] <+Pilau32> who are you talking to Marianne?
[2:35:29] <KennySD> That cigarette did not bend at all.
[2:35:30] <allanmiri> The incel demon!
[2:35:32] <Pookiedaexzile> When dark souls has better facial animation
[2:35:33] <mr_saturday93> fuck off twitch are breaks
[2:35:36] <skyentombment> @AdamElJefe it's dark souls mouth flapper
[2:35:38] <%Ghufufin> this dialogue
[2:35:39] <+strakillias> They really want the MC to be like Jessie from control except no gun
[2:35:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> If you're so freaked out by everything it's not normal, is it?
[2:35:40] <%topendbuzza> anwser to what????
[2:35:44] <Feared4Some> what is this dialog?
[2:35:45] <Pookiedaexzile> Hand never touched the table
[2:35:45] <servicesuspension> she's talking to the psychologist from shattered
[2:35:46] <KaitlynnHere> The e-no-suns
[2:35:48] <%abakkus> @Hzealot she's got a bad case of stock-prettygirl-model face
[2:35:48] <%Livelinne> The Debiiiiil? DarkMode
[2:35:49] <%ghostofsolomon> who is she talking to again?
[2:35:49] <KaitlynnHere> No
[2:35:49] <+abrupt_abe> Yo this game sucks man
[2:35:51] <+A0N33> Wait, is this a POST STORY framing device? Meaning we already know she lives through the plot?
[2:35:52] <falsecrabmeat> These are questions the player should be asking instead of the character
[2:35:52] <Byorski> yeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh...this could've been done better
[2:35:53] <%linSP> animate shun
[2:35:55] <+HeroSolaire> This is definitely a dialogue
[2:35:55] <+HalcyonNineThousand> bro this story telling
[2:35:56] <ralphfromdk> Thomas was alone!!! LUL
[2:35:56] <%crimsonharvest> that thing was a visual representation of your Millennial lust for death in tthe face of constant financial uncertainty
[2:35:57] <ittla> kinda deflates the tension when it flashes forward to her being totally okay
[2:35:58] <%topendbuzza> like why is she here????
[2:35:58] <KaitlynnHere> Damnit spellcheck
[2:35:59] <+vicar_anat> not really a fan of that framing device...
[2:35:59] <gcaithanos> the animations are not great...
[2:36:00] <+Shady_Zaku> KURWA GHOSTS lmfaooo
[2:36:00] <Laecerelius> I‚Äôm assuming she‚Äôs talking to some spirit they‚Äôll show us at the very end
[2:36:00] <%thomassolorio> bendy and the ink machine is better than this
[2:36:00] <%psidefx> End game shes scene with her talking to a mirror
[2:36:04] <Arek_1> "Who was Sadness?" LUL
[2:36:06] <KaitlynnHere> Ruining my jokes
[2:36:08] <@SoFarFetched> thats how I wake up
[2:36:11] <auraoftheearth009> There goes the script
[2:36:13] <%whyskeywolfe> The fuck was she talking to?
[2:36:15] <%thomassolorio> y is it like this
[2:36:18] <KaitlynnHere> No?
[2:36:18] <%anticrust> @PatStaresAt Well, now theres no suspense since we know she survives
[2:36:18] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp
[2:36:24] <iosephe> show don't tell!
[2:36:26] <+Pilau32> *yawn*
[2:36:26] <peachy996> Then leave now
[2:36:26] <%AdamElJefe> @AdamElJefe riffHaHa
[2:36:30] <+Pilau32> Well leave then
[2:36:31] <servicesuspension> what's that? is that the script?
[2:36:32] <%BoxNavy> this narration is giving me other m vibes
[2:36:33] <peachy996> Why not
[2:36:33] <%topendbuzza> WHY?
[2:36:37] <%Monkeyweed21> why not
[2:36:39] <rufus2k2> this feels like someone that thinks NuLara Croft is a compelling characters
[2:36:42] <%BoxNavy> S A D N E S S
[2:36:42] <%Mr_Pylon> Why not
[2:36:43] <KasiCrafter> Narration is also ANTI-scary.
[2:36:43] <%topendbuzza> SHE DOES????
[2:36:45] <sydowoodo> does she?
[2:36:46] <KaitlynnHere> .............
[2:36:47] <allanmiri> Show don't tell sweetie.
[2:36:47] <Vallacondios> yovgStare yovgStare yovgStare
[2:36:48] <peachy996> Who cares if it solves anything
[2:36:48] <Feared4Some> This feels like watching blade runner with the narration
[2:36:49] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I bet that name means a lot more in polish
[2:36:54] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat this is kind stupid.
[2:36:54] <+professormorrigan> ze sadness
[2:36:55] <Dragon_Batman> They haven't
[2:36:56] <+Pilau32> How does the GHOSt need you r help?
[2:36:56] <servicesuspension> SADNESS, IMPRISONING ME, ALL THAT I SEE, ABSOLUTE SADNESS
[2:36:56] <%GarbageNirvana> did Alan Wake write her
[2:36:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> I MUST help the ghost child
[2:36:57] <%SirGO0SE> but she got a telephone call LUL
[2:36:57] <%BoxNavy> you must help Sadness
[2:36:57] <Pookiedaexzile> Shes a Medium
[2:36:58] <%topendbuzza> NOT AT ALL
[2:36:59] <ralphfromdk> So..... 50/50 on Sadness being the big evil...
[2:37:00] <%shiplord13> Nope
[2:37:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Its her job
[2:37:01] <%UvBenServed> Some guy called
[2:37:01] <+Grayhammatter> probably not
[2:37:01] <@SoFarFetched> Hello Sadness, my old friend. I've come to talk to you again.
[2:37:01] <Byorski> I woke up with blood in my veins. My eyes perceived light. My muscles made me get up, and I walked with my legs to a location
[2:37:01] <%ArchimerCXV> the script is not holding up the themes nor the game and it's kinda painful
[2:37:02] <%BinaryFireball> I dont know why you are here like at all
[2:37:03] <%Dakuu75> -because random-guy said so
[2:37:03] <%anticrust> At least it looks Really Good
[2:37:04] <%Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt did this fucking bitch really name someone sadness? fuck this entire game
[2:37:08] <Pookiedaexzile> ITS FOR THE MUNEY
[2:37:09] <+Shady_Zaku> THE SILENT HILL RADIO
[2:37:10] <hokkemika> the dialogue is so goofy
[2:37:10] <+gimmickypizza> they didn't
[2:37:12] <KaitlynnHere> BECAUSE SADNESS PAT
[2:37:12] <s1rcuit> exactly
[2:37:13] <%Mr_Pylon> She must help the Indigo Sadness Child
[2:37:22] <ZComiX> what does she mean if she literally chosechose to come here
[2:37:23] <+Shady_Zaku> static = monstars comin
[2:37:24] <%Starotter70> It feels like there's potential for a good horror here, but just buried under a pile of easy and critically poor decisions
[2:37:25] <@SoFarFetched> @Mrbaconator Because the ghost girl only knows she goes by sadness cause she c an't remember what her name is.
[2:37:25] <%BoxNavy> happy :)
[2:37:25] <peachy996> Like I said Beyond Two Souls
[2:37:28] <%anticrust> Wait, she doesn't understand her posers?
[2:37:28] <%topendbuzza> got phone call come here thats it
[2:37:28] <MrBaldachin> üòÉ
[2:37:34] <+HeroSolaire> Mary and happy you're okay
[2:37:35] <%Master_Van> Some guy was really upset and needed her here. Not much else..
[2:37:37] <iosephe> cute
[2:37:39] <+TheMorilo> 2chill 2horror
[2:37:42] <Arek_1> @Mrbaconator No, that name was self-given.
[2:37:42] <+HeroSolaire> thats the password pat I figured it out
[2:37:42] <KasiCrafter> I mean. Isn't motivation super flimsy in all horror games like this? Everyone should bail at the FIRST monster they even see.
[2:37:42] <+ReallyBigRocks> Oh it's Michael Bay Bumblebee
[2:37:43] <auraoftheearth009> Someone played Shattered Memories
[2:37:43] <KaitlynnHere> ......

[2:37:58] <%StaceMcGate> RIIIICHARD
[2:38:00] <rytisone> from the bravo team

[2:38:40] <%topendbuzza> oh my goooood game stop
[2:38:44] <%whyskeywolfe> @TheotherKristian Just a big silly mess.

[2:38:54] <Noogiez> magnum dong
[2:38:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> My favorite thing about this chat is everyone racing to make the same jokes lmao
[2:38:56] <+teh_rawk> metal wolf chaos is a scarier game
[2:38:56] <gslayer14> well that was easy
[2:38:59] <+Shady_Zaku> RRRICHAAAARD
[2:39:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> It's a lot of fun
[2:39:02] <servicesuspension> raves ARE pretty scary
[2:39:03] <KasiCrafter> If she's experienced, the game should lean on it a BIT more. She needs to either be freaked out or wise to this BS.
[2:39:04] <+Pilau32> why are the lights so bright
[2:39:05] <%LymanAl> shit's locked
[2:39:06] <+GenesisKnight> Shit's locked
[2:39:07] <+TheotherKristian> Darn it!

[2:39:09] <@SoFarFetched> the buzzing seems to be the lights
[2:39:10] <+Grayhammatter> dayroom , found. EASY
[2:39:14] <+gimmickypizza> beyond two souls is a scarier game

[2:39:36] <servicesuspension> HE HATES IT
[2:39:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> someone should make a horror game where NONE of the doors are locked

[2:41:37] <s1rcuit> @blakeout both
[2:41:38] <bleugh> the raw sharks
[2:41:44] <%Agami23> i feel like stealth monsters sequences and combat kinda ruin story based psychological horror games like this.
[2:41:44] <+teh_rawk> wipe that pupper
[2:41:46] <chronoxgp> fart gas
[2:41:51] <+LazyBumNetwork> So did we stop already, chat?

[2:42:22] <+waltzqueen> accurate
[2:42:24] <Profmcstevie> Low interactivity

[2:42:43] <iosephe> he's so majestic
[2:42:47] <%wibbwobbler> game looks pretty ok can't wait to play it
[2:42:51] <+teh_rawk> crash bandicoot is a horror game
[2:42:51] <WinstonFromUndertale> This still the hour pre game?
[2:42:54] <%Starotter70> It's not scary or tense, it's boring
[2:42:55] <scrumbotime> He's so Solid looking

[2:43:11] <+ThisIsLloyd> oooo he tried for it tho\
[2:43:11] <%Bailey__gaming> He lunge
[2:43:12] <%SirGO0SE> he say "mine"
[2:43:12] <KaitlynnHere> And the ear folds
[2:43:13] <rufus2k2> gimme my treat taskmaster
[2:43:13] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[2:43:14] <Uselesswhitenoise> i think there should be a horror game with yakuza style combat imo
[2:43:15] <+Grayhammatter> bork
[2:43:17] <peachy996> He almost ate your hand
[2:43:17] <+AngriestAngryArtist> bork
[2:43:18] <$8BitDsx> BORK
[2:43:18] <ikantreeed> he grabbed that food so fast
[2:43:18] <%Ghufufin> geif gtfo
[2:43:20] <datfoogamma> Speak! *cough*
[2:43:22] <+Shady_Zaku> Whoossaguudbooii
[2:43:25] <+storebrandcandy> pupper is excite
[2:43:25] <sydowoodo> he's just like yeah sure whatever
[2:43:26] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Hefty boy
[2:43:27] <%BoxNavy> yet monkaS
[2:43:32] <auraoftheearth009> If this had been styled like Until Dawn, it would've been fine
[2:43:32] <%Bailey__gaming> SO FAST NANI
[2:43:35] <servicesuspension> I bet the Yakuza guys could make a solid horror
[2:43:36] <KasiCrafter> I actually think Francis York Morgon is a great self-aware supernatural investigator. Here she's just...too lukewarm for someone "experienced".
[2:43:38] <+JesusFromSpace> @PatStaresAt I don't think horror games should necessarily present you with an immediate danger or death mechanics. P.T. for example was super successful and it had 0 gameplay.
[2:43:38] <allanmiri> @TheViltsuZ I will agree with you on that.
[2:43:41] <KaitlynnHere> He will
[2:43:41] <KaiFawkes> Yo pat just got in, what you think so far?
[2:43:42] <%whyskeywolfe> Make sure to get him [MUCH FATTER]
[2:43:48] <rufus2k2> did pat finish cyber shadow?
[2:44:09] <%SirGO0SE> yeah LUL
[2:44:09] <chronoxgp> lucid dream based pt
[2:44:12] <chronoxgp> based
[2:44:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[2:44:20] <Profmcstevie> P.T threatened you all the time, you just don't where it's coming from
[2:44:20] <+waltzqueen> Lids WILL eat you
[2:44:23] <+Veraverse> LOOK BEHIND YOU
[2:44:23] <+JesusFromSpace> eh, it's a timer and that's it
[2:44:24] <Pookiedaexzile> But Pat, What if your bad at the game like the commenter
[2:44:24] <%caramelatte1> Amnesia dark decent
[2:44:26] <Profmcstevie> also sometimes it just breaks your neck
[2:44:26] <KaitlynnHere> Oh yea I forgot
[2:44:27] <+waltzqueen> lisa*
[2:44:29] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Phasmophobia needs a better jump scare murder
[2:44:30] <Pookiedaexzile> then its just walking
[2:44:30] <Noogiez> man, i wish PT got made
[2:44:31] <+Veraverse> Don't trust the tap water
[2:44:32] <KaitlynnHere> But it makes sense though
[2:44:33] <falsecrabmeat> The lady who made Anatomy put out more free games in October if you want some solid horror games
[2:44:36] <+JesusFromSpace> you can't make a mistake in that game per se
[2:44:37] <rytisone> Dead Space 2 starts strong
[2:44:39] <Cactuskris> Silent Hill is only scary the first time because you don¬¥t know, but it¬¥s not like a lot of stuff is actually that dangerous
[2:44:49] <ikantreeed> i've got nithign too NotLikeThis
[2:44:49] <%topendbuzza> oh we still going?
[2:44:50] <+waltzqueen> @falsecrabmeat really? that's dope
[2:44:52] <KasiCrafter> Well, there IS Amnesia The Dark Decent. A *lot* of its gameplay was just lies!
[2:44:55] <%LymanAl> The developers definitely have a good sense of tone, but the execution can be iffy
[2:45:01] <ikantreeed> i can't even type NotLikeThis
[2:45:05] <servicesuspension> They really should stick to the classics and just give you a gun
[2:45:08] <+DragonArt07> So would you say Alien Isolation is a good example of a horror game?
[2:45:09] <peachy996> A lot of Silent Hill's scariness is in its atmosphere which this game lacks
[2:45:13] <DracaenaLeaf> S A D N E S S
[2:45:14] <+HalcyonNineThousand> she‚Äôs fighting all her ex‚Äôs
[2:45:21] <peachy996> Mostly cuz some people don't shut up
[2:45:23] <+HeroSolaire> Silent Hll doesn't even need to have dangerous scary monsters because 90% of the time the scenary is opressive by itself
[2:45:28] <bleugh> profound sadness
[2:45:30] <+takutoots> PT benefits from it being short and death not always being a setback also changing the game almost every 5-10 minutes
[2:45:32] <%topendbuzza> no but phone call
[2:45:32] <%UvBenServed> KETCHUP
[2:45:34] <Dragon_Batman> The most they did was that phone call
[2:45:34] <%SirGO0SE> i hate how on the nose this is. who are these games for?
[2:45:35] <Profmcstevie> 60 seconds of setting, then GO. easy
[2:45:37] <KaitlynnHere> Hello darkness my dear friend
[2:45:39] <s1rcuit> I thought she worked at a funeral home
[2:45:39] <%BoxNavy> but thats not mysterious enough
[2:45:40] <Dragon_Batman> But it wasn't enough
[2:45:40] <falsecrabmeat> @waltzqueen Kitty Horrorshow has all her games. A lot of them are free
[2:45:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait is that not the motivation?
[2:45:54] <allanmiri> She love ghost. Ghost is love. Ghost is life... sorta...
[2:45:55] <%Livelinne> Kappa
[2:45:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why are you here then?
[2:45:56] <+HeroSolaire> The last of us 3? Pog
[2:45:56] <%topendbuzza> nope
[2:45:57] <KaitlynnHere> I‚Äôm glad to see you again
[2:45:58] <%SirGO0SE> yeah visuals is something this game has done well
[2:45:59] <+storebrandcandy> I loved anatomy so much
[2:46:00] <+Grayhammatter> giant ass pool
[2:46:09] <%drabberfaun535> it would have been super neat if the ghost powers were killing her and she needs to learn to control them
[2:46:09] <MrBaldachin> she's just exploring cuz she feels like it
[2:46:10] <peachy996> @SirGO0SE People who are desperate for horror games with fixed angles I imagine
[2:46:10] <sydowoodo> so like obra djinn but not really?
[2:46:11] <waffleandman> that is so stupid LUL
[2:46:18] <+HalcyonNineThousand> it will reveal itself to her
[2:46:19] <Profmcstevie> problem 1: "Why the fuck do we care about her past"
[2:46:21] <%topendbuzza> one 20 sec phone call
[2:46:22] <servicesuspension> Graphics less detailed and more colorful would help
[2:46:29] <%SirGO0SE> @peachy996 dang thats real tbh
[2:46:35] <+takutoots> wait this reminds me of another game with porcelains character remother something
[2:46:37] <s1rcuit> yeah, she seems at peace with her live so far
[2:46:39] <%Starotter70> I didn't even realize she had a lack of a past
[2:46:41] <%captain_thickthighs> tomas or satom?
[2:46:42] <%abakkus> "oh my past!! i need my past!!" is so. i dont give a damn about that motivation at all, like, ever.
[2:46:45] <+HeroSolaire> SO they gave up on the dual dimension vision, why force that before?
[2:46:47] <Cactuskris> she is literally emotionally and physically scarred by her past
[2:46:49] <+Caidezes> She seems pretty chill about everything.
[2:46:51] <%BoxNavy> MILICJA
[2:46:56] <+GrinningAlex> So far for me the strongest part is the art design for the hell world or what you call it
[2:46:56] <Meekest> First Thomas, then Richard, now Frank
[2:46:57] <+abrupt_abe> Hi Frank
[2:46:58] <clockworkidiot> it might as well have been Enzo saying "It'll clear up that mysterious past of yours"
[2:47:02] <%luftraumm1> luftraumm1 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 24 months! because of world troubles dollar is very high and I had to pause my subscription to ffxiv and instead I have been playing a bit of wow witch is way cheaper, it is STILL an mmo of the last century, so much bad stuff that only shows in comparison to ffxiv
[2:47:03] <%Starotter70> It sure is
[2:47:04] <+Pilau32> Graphics looks like Last of US. One. Remastered at least
[2:47:05] <bleugh> problematic
[2:47:05] <+Matto424> basically she had nothing better to do
[2:47:08] <SaltyAzteca> BUDDY
[2:47:12] <%Spydurman> Hi Frank, can I be Bob?
[2:47:16] <%G_Thunders> Even if it was a fake call to lure her here, yeah hiring fire for a job would be better
[2:47:18] <Cactuskris> if she¬¥d constantly freaked out you would complain about that
[2:47:18] <servicesuspension> Why is it always mysterious past and amnesia shit
[2:47:19] <iosephe> TOVARISCH
[2:47:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> @HeroSolaire I'm sure it'll be back and hang around for too long again
[2:47:20] <Meekest> We GET IT she's a MEDIUM
[2:47:21] <%Undenizen> drink
[2:47:27] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Frank: This plan needs to be cancelled.
[2:47:30] <s1rcuit> @Matto424 that's the best explanation I've heard so far
[2:47:31] <+Grayhammatter> ok sure
[2:47:31] <+MugenSandan> that was the most American COMRADE I've ever heard
[2:47:34] <%SirGO0SE> cant escape the echo
[2:47:36] <Pookiedaexzile> If she says Stick one more god damn time
[2:47:37] <chronoxgp> phantasy star is free you spend like a dollar an hour
[2:47:40] <Arek_1> "Heroic" Red Army.
[2:47:44] <%abakkus> every time she speaks it's just the script caving our skulls in insisting it's Deep
[2:47:45] <bleugh> couldn't it just be a mystery thing and she's just a medium
[2:47:46] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I thought she was an small
[2:47:49] <%topendbuzza> ?????
[2:47:59] <%LymanAl> WHy is he southern
[2:47:59] <rytisone> A big titty nurse
[2:48:04] <%UvBenServed> Because Silent Hill
[2:48:08] <%Undenizen> it's like SOMETHING POSSESSED HER
[2:48:08] <peachy996> Right now the only nice things I can say about this is the soundtrack and fixed angles
[2:48:12] <%Livelinne> DarkMode DarkMode DarkMode
[2:48:21] <servicesuspension> fixed angles are very nice
[2:48:21] <%AdamElJefe> She was posessed by a thing
[2:48:23] <+GrinningAlex> A lot of telling instead of showing
[2:48:24] <%SirGO0SE> wuz dat smell?
[2:48:24] <peachy996> They're not great fixed angles mind you but still
[2:48:26] <%AdamElJefe> maybe?
[2:48:30] <%BoxNavy> delicious delicious blood
[2:48:30] <+takutoots> delicious
[2:48:37] <+barrakuta371> that smell? it blud
[2:48:39] <Pookiedaexzile> HE's southern because hes' from the Kansai era of Poland
[2:48:40] <+Grayhammatter> what's that smell?
[2:48:45] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Hey, it‚Äôs that blood!
[2:48:45] <servicesuspension> bring prerendered backgrounds back
[2:48:48] <+HalcyonNineThousand> is big vampire waifu from rs8 a response to this medium lady
[2:48:51] <%topendbuzza> the soundtrack is nice
[2:48:53] <Arek_1> @Pookiedaexzile LUL
[2:48:54] <chronoxgp> they could make this game scarey as hell with some grunge metal sfx
[2:48:55] <%Pappajimbo> i hope its not chris blood
[2:48:57] <gcaithanos> fear the old blood
[2:49:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> A lot of showing then destroying any intrigue with too much telling
[2:49:11] <+Pilau32> To feel what?
[2:49:15] <%topendbuzza> ehhs
[2:49:18] <servicesuspension> those were gud
[2:49:18] <Dragon_Batman> Decent in their own right
[2:49:18] <iosephe> ripoffs
[2:49:19] <%jinking79> really hate it when character question supernatural stuff after going through supernatural stuff 10 min ago
[2:49:20] <Meekest> They were both very good
[2:49:21] <i_need_sciss0rz> and blair witch
[2:49:28] <%Starotter70> Those were alright
[2:49:30] <$Futurecity10> observer is better than this
[2:49:31] <MrBaldachin> I think layers of fear is a better "horror" game personally
[2:49:32] <rafflespaddock> Horror Simulators
[2:49:32] <+b_aleph> did we find which medium is it yet? is it VHS?
[2:49:32] <ranarath> Oo, Observer was actually pretty good. Layers of Fear was okay.
[2:49:33] <ElusiveStarlord> Does she have prior knowlage aboout this place? cuz idk why she would be like "HOW?WHY' about the nurse if she didnt know who she was?
[2:49:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Layers of Fear sucked ass
[2:49:35] <ralphfromdk> walking simulators indeed... And so is this... but with shite puzzles.
[2:49:35] <waffleandman> its also not good
[2:49:39] <Dragon_Batman> Yea true
[2:49:42] <+TheMorilo> people just don't shut up in this game
[2:49:42] <TheViltsuZ> Observer is really cool. The cyberpunk complex is really creepy.
[2:49:46] <marrowjuice> i'm so sick of horror walking sims
[2:49:47] <+TheotherKristian> Disappointed!!
[2:49:53] <+HalcyonNineThousand> ~camera angles~
[2:49:55] <+Naey_Naey> I liked Layers of Fear
[2:49:55] <%SirGO0SE> are they really puzzles if the only options are solutions
[2:50:00] <Pookiedaexzile> Walking Sims with Natalia Fillion on the mi
[2:50:01] <%topendbuzza> growth

[2:50:34] <%RyTYoung> NotLikeThis
[2:50:35] <Swimmingrock> @marrowjuice There's a fucking plague of them on Steam and I've started ignoring them as a genre. Don't even read the description anymore.
[2:50:42] <pennykettle_> SirGO0SE that's a quote for the history books
[2:50:49] <+GrinningAlex> When they say it's inspired by Silent Hill people are gonna compare it to Silent Hill
[2:50:57] <allanmiri> @SirGO0SE You managed to put in words something that has been on my mind for awhile but couldn't describe. Thanks.
[2:51:07] <Pookiedaexzile> With a whiff a silent hill
[2:51:10] <servicesuspension> I know that a classic survival horror is not easy to make, but if you're gonna, why half-ass it like this
[2:51:11] <Pookiedaexzile> a smig
[2:51:13] <TheViltsuZ> @Swimmingrock That's just dumb
[2:51:17] <Pookiedaexzile> A sprinkle
[2:51:26] <bettysharkface> Is this a spooky game?
[2:51:29] <Dragon_Batman> Your not in all truth
[2:51:30] <s1rcuit> I think this game is making me sleepy
[2:51:36] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont FEEL like Spiderman
[2:51:36] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt feels like Beyond Two Souls
[2:51:37] <%topendbuzza> you sure are
[2:51:40] <marrowjuice> i've noticed that games that try to be the new silent hill never try to actually use silent hill's gameplay
[2:51:40] <Profmcstevie> We follow the glowing objects, we have not explored for dick
[2:51:40] <peachy996> I don't think it's half assing more that it's beyond their scope currently
[2:51:40] <%wibbwobbler> yep
[2:51:43] <+Veraverse> But two worlds at once tho!
[2:51:44] <+HalcyonNineThousand> @bettysharkface it‚Äôs trying to be
[2:51:45] <Swimmingrock> @TheViltsuZ Why? I have no interest in them.
[2:51:46] <+Veraverse> SSD!
[2:51:49] <ralphfromdk> and this was one of Microsofts biiiiig things...
[2:51:49] <+zsDirtyHarry> RE Baby!
[2:51:50] <+cvp5127> so a vn?
[2:51:52] <dukenux> Bolt Cutters my old friend
[2:51:53] <+Veraverse> Oh no
[2:51:54] <%BoxNavy> the resident evil bolt cutters
[2:51:55] <+Pilau32> RE bolt cutters lol
[2:51:55] <penitentpendant> This game does the most damning thing I can say to describe a game: It's boring
[2:51:57] <%G_Thunders> Beyond Two Souls would‚Äôve been way better if Jodie was a ghost hunter
[2:51:57] <lazerscraper> SHITS LOCKED
[2:51:58] <pennykettle_> Oh nooo you're right
[2:51:59] <Decarcassor> They clearly put effort into the environment, and the music is good obviously. There is just not much... game happening.
[2:52:00] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt Is it a good narrative so far?
[2:52:02] <KasiCrafter> Guided = Scripted = Not Scary
[2:52:04] <servicesuspension> UNDERWATER

[2:52:11] <+takutoots> Whoa
[2:52:11] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Paige stepped on it
[2:52:12] <TheViltsuZ> @Swimmingrock SOMA is a masterpiece. The genre can do great things.
[2:52:13] <sydowoodo> look there's a kitty on the wall
[2:52:14] <scrumbotime> I do not like the weird child
[2:52:14] <rytisone> bolt cutters really getting their mileage in horror games
[2:52:15] <DracaenaLeaf> Madness
[2:52:17] <+gimmickypizza> beyond two souls was more entertaining
[2:52:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> ow broken mirror sharp
[2:52:20] <peachy996> boooo
[2:52:20] <%topendbuzza> ha ha
[2:52:22] <%Starotter70> Waka Waka
[2:52:23] <waffleandman> go through the glass vagina
[2:52:23] <%Monkeyweed21> dangit Paige
[2:52:24] <+professormorrigan> legit pretty sleeper game
[2:52:26] <MrBaldachin> that was mildly tense but then she was flippant again about it and killed it
[2:52:27] <rufus2k2> follow the snowflies
[2:52:29] <+DragonArt07> all thats missing is the quick time
[2:52:30] <Cactuskris> I¬¥d prefer that over hitting thinsg with a pipe again
[2:52:33] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[2:52:37] <Swimmingrock> @TheViltsuZ Watched part of a SOMA playthrough and found it boring.
[2:52:38] <bleugh> 4Head
[2:52:39] <%RyTYoung> oh hi mark
[2:52:39] <lazerscraper> hahahaha what a story sad
[2:52:40] <+JesusFromSpace> To me this feels like a point and click adventure game. That's kinda why I enjoy it.
[2:52:41] <Waldo_landfill> whys this ghostie girl bein all scary even though she is so nice to you when you talk. what's her problem
[2:52:43] <servicesuspension> she's laughing at the script
[2:52:45] <+vicar_anat> I feel like every single minute, someone is talking in this game
[2:52:46] <Darkdrome7> dear god I can't stand this voice acting
[2:52:49] <peachy996> I just want to walk next to her and say "Next Bit" for every quip she makes
[2:52:49] <ExpressNode> Beyond two balls
[2:52:50] <+TheMorilo> this game needs 90% more silence
[2:52:54] <pennykettle_> LUL what a story mark
[2:52:54] <penitentpendant> I stick with my original comment: This is like Silent Hill by David Cage, but the interesting crazy sucked out.
[2:52:55] <dukenux> Sadness was a horror game for Wii that never happened, i think it was even the same people behind it
[2:52:56] <+vicar_anat> barely any quiet time at all
[2:52:57] <Dragon_Batman> This is stuff they did in there past games I think
[2:52:59] <%Livelinne> I love this toy
[2:53:03] <%topendbuzza> NO?
[2:53:07] <TheViltsuZ> @Swimmingrock The game has an amazing story. Should play it yourself. It's easily one of the best horror games ever made.
[2:53:08] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> What a story, Marianne!
[2:53:10] <Arek_1> Was that Dakooters!? LUL
[2:53:13] <Katorskay> They're gone now
[2:53:14] <%topendbuzza> KIDS how did you guess
[2:53:21] <blakeout> Is Devotion ever going to see the light of day again?
[2:53:24] <Uselesswhitenoise> is sadness the only character or can we meet the rest of the inside out cast
[2:53:29] <lazerscraper> getting awfully close to "We're meeting G over there" levels of acting
[2:53:30] <+Veraverse> Sometimes, no dub and a text box works fine
[2:53:31] <KasiCrafter> I mean. You saw Sadness. We knew kids were here...
[2:53:34] <dukenux> getting a voice acting budget was a mistake
[2:53:34] <Uselesswhitenoise> anger joy and disgust
[2:53:36] <%drabberfaun535> its as if the devs were trying to make a silent hill game from memory
[2:53:36] <peachy996> @dukenux I think you're right. I remember Matt pointing that out during Layers of Fear

[2:54:01] <+takutoots> its that dog
[2:54:03] <Laecerelius> Otto‚Äôs Day Out
[2:54:04] <Swimmingrock> @TheViltsuZ I don't think you're understanding my issue with horror walking sims is that I find them incredibly boring to play. I won't see the rest of the story, because there's no way I'll sit through more than 30 minutes before losing interest.
[2:54:09] <%Agami23> these kids sound like kids in a david cage game
[2:54:11] <+storebrandcandy> Wiener ghost
[2:54:16] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Wouldn‚Äôt the children be swimming not playing hide and seek?
[2:54:16] <servicesuspension> see chat? this is why so many game characters are silent protagonists
[2:54:20] <%drabberfaun535> But only ever played with a guide book
[2:54:25] <%captain_thickthighs> this game kind of feels like a tech demo for like the Xbox one
[2:54:29] <dukenux> PowerUpL FrankerZ PowerUpR
[2:54:39] <dukenux> yeah, Jodie u freak
[2:54:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> Yeah go fuck yourself bernard
[2:54:40] <+Veraverse> Holy shit that child voice was rough
[2:54:41] <%BoxNavy> i dont remember
[2:54:42] <DracaenaLeaf> walk
[2:54:42] <%RyTYoung> I dunno
[2:54:43] <$8BitDsx> fuck u bernard
[2:54:44] <MrBaldachin> walk
[2:54:44] <Profmcstevie> Looked
[2:54:45] <Uselesswhitenoise> horror walking games are fun to watch in youtube
[2:54:45] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Spirit blast
[2:54:45] <SaltyAzteca> look good 4Head
[2:54:47] <%Monkeyweed21> bumble
[2:54:47] <penitentpendant> Played a boring game
[2:54:47] <+GrinningAlex> The game does a lot of thinking for you instead of letting you find out the solution yourself
[2:54:47] <peachy996> Walked
[2:54:47] <mr_saturday93> walked around
[2:54:48] <%TheGreatSunbro> TheGreatSunbro subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! LETS GO
[2:54:48] <fuji_92> walked and look at stuff
[2:54:48] <%BestTeaMaker> walking
[2:54:49] <%Dakuu75> walking simulator
[2:54:49] <dukenux> walked around?
[2:54:52] <servicesuspension> You walked
[2:54:52] <Arek_1> You, uh...
[2:54:53] <+Grayhammatter> walked
[2:54:54] <%AdamElJefe> YOU MISSED A THING
[2:54:55] <%whyskeywolfe> That was 10 minutes ago Pat.
[2:54:55] <servicesuspension> You talked
[2:54:56] <%UvBenServed> A mirror broke or something
[2:54:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> Was that half an hour ago? Holy shit
[2:54:57] <rytisone> this feels like point and click adventure game
[2:54:57] <+Veraverse> You heard exposition out of context I guess
[2:54:58] <%Mr_Pylon> Uhhhh, walked around and looked a rotating object while children talk.
[2:54:59] <%snugglepuggs> but shut up its spooky tho
[2:55:00] <bleugh> i don't think it's been a half hour
[2:55:00] <%slaughtedlamb> fucking nothing
[2:55:00] <Pookiedaexzile> This is basically a podcast
[2:55:02] <+MugenSandan> E M O S H U N
[2:55:02] <Srthunda> you have listened to your character talk to themselves, mostly
[2:55:03] <%RyTYoung> and walked
[2:55:06] <servicesuspension> Ehhh
[2:55:08] <%topendbuzza> theres voices in my head they tlak to me they understand
[2:55:08] <%wibbwobbler> richard
[2:55:08] <+gimmickypizza> beyond two souls had a better gimmick
[2:55:09] <chronoxgp> shining
[2:55:10] <blackbaron98> GAmEpLaY
[2:55:11] <%linSP> Are you having fun pat
[2:55:12] <servicesuspension> I don't remember
[2:55:12] <theanora1> Medium seems like the most graphically intense walking sim released yet
[2:55:12] <+Gamefriendly> you got closer to beating the game
[2:55:13] <ranarath> You ran from a demon and hid badly from it.
[2:55:15] <Arek_1> @MugenSandan LUL
[2:55:19] <%jinking79> walking more walking a bit of running and more walking
[2:55:19] <+GrinningAlex> Not doing a good job atm
[2:55:22] <$8BitDsx> I feel there's no reason for you to be doing anything. There's no sense of urgency, or a threat of any kind. She can just..leave.
[2:55:22] <%Undenizen> DOES it?
[2:55:23] <+WutangchickeN> @PatStaresAt I'll be honest I would have turned the game off as soon as I saw the 'combat' section
[2:55:24] <Decarcassor> walked and interacted with prompts, so you could walk more ?
[2:55:24] <%topendbuzza> you have a map
[2:55:25] <Pookiedaexzile> And it throws shit at you
[2:55:26] <allanmiri> You met a ghost girl and ran from a half moon baphomet.
[2:55:27] <+carfar_farcar> sound like silent hill
[2:55:27] <%captain_thickthighs> you was doing the bare medium üòÇ
[2:55:28] <penitentpendant> The Medium feels like the gaming equivalent of copying someone else's homework SO BADLY they still fail the assignment.
[2:55:29] <MrBaldachin> and one of the top reviews I saw was praising the pacing ü§î
[2:55:30] <TheViltsuZ> @Swimmingrock Are you sure? Maybe you just haven't played a great "horror walking sim" where the story keeps you engaged from start to finish? I admit, there aren't that many, but SOMA is one of them...
[2:55:30] <Profmcstevie> Solving and exploring
[2:55:30] <servicesuspension> YOU SEE WEIRD SHIT
[2:55:31] <%thedankestmeeme> I joined the stream 15 mins ago and still dont know what you're doing
[2:55:33] <%RyTYoung> Do you map?
[2:55:33] <+professormorrigan> pretty effective sedative
[2:55:33] <rytisone> the combat sucks in SH tho
[2:55:34] <fuji_92> you fight notes
[2:55:34] <%chiazam> Are you having fun?
[2:55:35] <Pookiedaexzile> I WONDER WHAT PART IS MISSING
[2:55:37] <+HalcyonNineThousand> this is an lp to sleep to
[2:55:39] <%topendbuzza> real puzzles
[2:55:41] <joejoelololl> Just play silent hill
[2:55:42] <lazerscraper> you try to open locked doors
[2:55:42] <+Jaysky> Well normally you talk to weirdos not just yourself
[2:55:42] <Furxio> try to find a stranger
[2:55:44] <%RyTYoung> NO U
[2:55:44] <peachy996> It's definitely giving me a bigger appreciation of the monsters existing in Silent Hill.
[2:55:45] <Visorak6> Consult GameFAQs
[2:55:48] <lazerscraper> You hug walls
[2:55:52] <+Veraverse> LUL
[2:55:53] <%Daxalog> Your lost
[2:55:53] <%BoxNavy> no one understands that about RE and SH
[2:55:55] <ralphfromdk> But Pat... That sounds like gameplay....
[2:55:57] <fuji_92> you fight lost, you get monsters, you run notes
[2:55:59] <+WutangchickeN> This is supremely disappointing
[2:56:01] <%exileshadow03> The director of this project clearly doesnt know the genre
[2:56:04] <+gimmickypizza> so no shoe bangs in this one
[2:56:05] <blakeout> HECK
[2:56:05] <+Jaysky> Shut the HECK UP
[2:56:05] <marrowjuice> i really wish horror games had combat again
[2:56:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Gameplay is hard
[2:56:08] <+IrishWeegee> heck
[2:56:08] <%RyTYoung> BERNARD, STFU
[2:56:09] <+Veraverse> JU
[2:56:10] <%BoxNavy> people think those games are scary cus ahhh monster ahhh grimy environment
[2:56:11] <+GrinningAlex> It misses the little sandbox area where you find items, supplies and solves puzzles.
[2:56:11] <Bluewolf544> PunOko
[2:56:12] <+gimmickypizza> shot bangs
[2:56:14] <+Grayhammatter> HECK
[2:56:14] <+Gamblor69> T34-85?
[2:56:15] <+HalcyonNineThousand> spirit blast that kid
[2:56:16] <Pookiedaexzile> Gameplay is hard to do
[2:56:16] <+GenesisKnight> KIDS ARE CRUEL, JACK!
[2:56:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> Just walk in a circle while new things appear in places you've already been
[2:56:20] <%Daxalog> This feels like how I fealt when I played Silent Hill 1. Just lost and mad.
[2:56:20] <WinstonFromUndertale> How long has pat been playing this game for already?
[2:56:27] <%topendbuzza> back here
[2:56:33] <waffleandman> i like how people unironically like david cage games LUL
[2:56:34] <Pookiedaexzile> but combat is diffult
[2:56:34] <%Mr_Pylon> But we must know what happened to Bernard!
[2:56:36] <penitentpendant> This feels like a tech demo game, through and through
[2:56:37] <%thomassolorio> and blood doesn't stay red like that it turns dark brown
[2:56:40] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt what is your quitting point?
[2:56:42] <+Jaysky> PunOko cirCop No more heckin or I'll get to blastin
[2:56:42] <+IrishWeegee> !uptime
[2:56:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[2:56:46] <peachy996> The baby looked at you?
[2:56:50] <%Livelinne> Dear Esther??
[2:56:53] <+LazyBumNetwork> Hey, chat. Do we know if there are project leads who don‚Äôt really play games on their off time..?
[2:56:54] <%Undenizen> it's Alice in wonderland
[2:56:57] <Pookiedaexzile> David Cage has Dialogue options
[2:56:58] <penitentpendant> @waffleandman Stupid crazy is, at least, interesting
[2:56:59] <%BoxNavy> Snowdrop
[2:56:59] <Pookiedaexzile> thats gameplay
[2:57:00] <+Veraverse> 3 hours of nothing!
[2:57:01] <servicesuspension> !Pat's goodwill to the game at risk!
[2:57:02] <dukenux> k o t
[2:57:03] <+HalcyonNineThousand> is sadness her?
[2:57:04] <Pookiedaexzile> Thats leagues ahead
[2:57:05] <sydowoodo> that's jack's cat's name
[2:57:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> SNowdrop is gonna be her cat from the past isnt it
[2:57:20] <+professormorrigan> @HalcyonNineThousand probs
[2:57:26] <+Veraverse> WHY NARRATE THIS
[2:57:28] <marrowjuice> ughhhh, i bet she used to live here
[2:57:29] <+Veraverse> WHY
[2:57:30] <dukenux> how sad does the game make you feel so far
[2:57:30] <TheViltsuZ> PENIS
[2:57:30] <+Pilau32> jesus
[2:57:31] <+GrinningAlex> Again the game is telling you what to do
[2:57:34] <TheViltsuZ> TRAP
[2:57:35] <peachy996> really lady?
[2:57:38] <allanmiri> Game making sure you know to go to the mirror.
[2:57:39] <+Pilau32> Shut up marriane
[2:57:39] <+DragonArt07> the fact that gameplay so far has just been to create atmosphere rather then provide stimulation, is sad. Wasted potential.
[2:57:42] <+GenesisKnight> SHOW! DON'T TELL DAMMIT!
[2:57:42] <MrBaldachin> I CAN FEEL THE PUZZLE
[2:57:44] <+IrishWeegee> @winstonfromundertale about 2 hours, pat usually talks for an hour before game
[2:57:44] <%topendbuzza> thanks game
[2:57:46] <+HalcyonNineThousand> she has a throbbing in her panrs
[2:57:47] <Uselesswhitenoise> the game is its own faq guide
[2:57:50] <servicesuspension> I know this is gonna sound pretty immature, but hear me out guys: GIVE US A FUCKING GUN
[2:57:50] <dukenux> oh is it her old orphanage, and she forgot?
[2:57:50] <Visorak6> This game's problem is there's absolutely zero tension
[2:57:53] <+vicar_anat> no joke, the narration is making me feel tight in the chest
[2:57:53] <$Quiet__Viking> narration is dumb
[2:57:57] <%ArchimerCXV> remove every other line and it might actually build suspense
[2:57:58] <%thomassolorio> these ghosts are pretty good at blood graffiti
[2:58:00] <+Veraverse> Jesus fucking Christ
[2:58:00] <+VoidN0> this is worse than downcoming
[2:58:10] <The_500lb_Child> Heard you like puzzles, so we solved them for you.
[2:58:14] <s1rcuit> and the places you can go are either plot or pointless
[2:58:14] <+LazyBumNetwork> Game faq should just read listen to your character.
[2:58:14] <%G_Thunders> Wait does she not understand she was the one being bullied in those ghost memories??
[2:58:19] <fuji_92> better than homepour tho
[2:58:20] <dukenux> oh noo
[2:58:21] <gyrwyrm> I just got here game bad?
[2:58:22] <lazerscraper> HOMEcoming
[2:58:22] <%BoxNavy> downcoming had elements of horror games at least
[2:58:24] <$Futurecity10> oh god I'm down cumming
[2:58:25] <servicesuspension> at least downpour had the funnies
[2:58:25] <ExpressNode> Downcumming
[2:58:26] <ergulor> wait downpour or homecoming or both?
[2:58:28] <Decarcassor> If a game can be defined as a serie of interesting choices, this is not a game.
[2:58:29] <Triplicat> LUL
[2:58:29] <%exileshadow03> NO EXPLORE, SOLVE PUZZLE...said the game
[2:58:32] <+Pilau32> The devs must think americans are idiots
[2:58:32] <+GrinningAlex> At least this game has better art design
[2:58:32] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[2:58:33] <%Undenizen> you're coming off that way a lil bit pat :3
[2:58:34] <+gimmickypizza> at least you get to throw an accent to an abyss in downpour
[2:58:34] <peachy996> We always think that until we remember downcoming
[2:58:35] <%PanicSwytch> Down coming LUL
[2:58:36] <%linSP> Downwhore
[2:58:36] <%arcielardor> downcumming
[2:58:37] <gyrwyrm> Oh no game bad
[2:58:37] <%Starotter70> Hard to appreciate an atmosphere over droning narration
[2:58:39] <servicesuspension> YES HE SAID IT
[2:58:39] <Arek_1> LUL
[2:58:40] <+Veraverse> Homepour
[2:58:41] <KaiserMario> YOU WISH you could throw an axe down a chasm!
[2:58:42] <%BoxNavy> paige monkaS
[2:58:42] <penitentpendant> While it is disappointing longterm, I'm glad my initial impression of this game was spot on
[2:58:43] <+LazyBumNetwork> But you are
[2:58:46] <+DragonArt07> this game has potential, but it falls short which is frustrating.
[2:58:47] <viciousgrim> but how does it hold up on it's own @PatStaresAt
[2:58:48] <@SoFarFetched> This seems more like a Story driven game with horror elements,rather than a horror game with a story.
[2:58:49] <+professormorrigan> just wait... for the good... part ResidentSleeper
[2:58:49] <+GenesisKnight> You're always in both tho!
[2:58:50] <allanmiri> We can see that sweetie.
[2:58:50] <%thomassolorio> at least downcoming had axes
[2:58:51] <+Draco_Aeris> the trailers looked terrible lol
[2:58:51] <+gimmickypizza> throw the axe
[2:58:52] <$8BitDsx> I mean, her jacket is kinda cool. That's a plus.
[2:58:53] <AllonBachuth> I don't even know that you've seen the actually shitty parts of this game yet
[2:58:54] <%exileshadow03> Silent Hill: Sundowning
[2:58:55] <%aishman> @PatStaresAt Hey guys I just jumped on here, game not good?
[2:58:57] <dukenux> jaded SH mark wishes for his tank controls horror to be back
[2:59:00] <+WutangchickeN> EVEN SHE SOUNDS FUCKING BORED
[2:59:02] <%ArchimerCXV> Are you shocked OR NOT?!
[2:59:02] <%Valdorick> LUL
[2:59:08] <rufus2k2> lol her run animation
[2:59:09] <+Veraverse> LUL
[2:59:10] <SpaceGuntank> wanted Silent Hill, got Beyond Two Souls instead.
[2:59:10] <reonome> oof
[2:59:10] <%Daxalog> OH NO
[2:59:11] <+xmetalicdemonx> it just seems boring.
[2:59:11] <+IrishWeegee> miss medium's wild ride
[2:59:11] <peachy996> This is a lot like Downpour's Movie Thatre shit
[2:59:11] <+MrTurtleThief> oof

[2:59:15] <%aishman> NOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:59:18] <+JJsAdventure> Its dull?
[2:59:18] <reonome> BLAND
[2:59:18] <dukenux> thats the wirst
[2:59:19] <chronoxgp> this game has some Zdzislaw Beksinski art that looks good
[2:59:20] <%Monkeyweed21> this would be way better if you did a big weed
[2:59:23] <Bluewolf544> yikes
[2:59:24] <%topendbuzza> the worse kind of not good
[2:59:24] <+JJsAdventure> Sucks
[2:59:25] <%BoxNavy> so pat what are you gonna stream on saturday?
[2:59:27] <fuji_92> mediocre NotLikeThis
[2:59:28] <penitentpendant> Boring, the worst thing you can use to describe the game
[2:59:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why is she so confused by ghost stuff every time if this shit is literally her job? It's always "what the fuck is this"
[2:59:31] <Profmcstevie> Entertainment media is failing at basic job: Entertain
[2:59:31] <dukenux> MEDIOCRE
[2:59:31] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Music rocks tho
[2:59:33] <+GrinningAlex> It's MEDIUMocre
[2:59:33] <%aishman> That sucks so much
[2:59:33] <%wibbwobbler> disagree imo lol
[2:59:33] <ralphfromdk> It just.... is....
[2:59:33] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I want her to fight juren already
[2:59:34] <%Monkeyweed21> Do a big weed and this would be way better @PatStaresAt
[2:59:36] <+HalcyonNineThousand> jiren
[2:59:37] <bettysharkface> It's forgettable
[2:59:40] <+Caidezes> This bitch talks too much.
[2:59:40] <gyrwyrm> Ok but also Pat has bad game opinions so I will reserve judgement
[2:59:40] <@SoFarFetched> there's too much talking that it takes you out of reactions to things.
[2:59:41] <+takutoots> can't what for dat soundtrack tho
[2:59:41] <%Valdorick> 6/10
[2:59:43] <rufus2k2> Akira Yamaoka can't catch a break
[2:59:46] <peachy996> Soundtrack is great tho
[2:59:47] <Dragon_Batman> I come back to some kool looking shit
[2:59:48] <%topendbuzza> the soundtack is nice!
[2:59:51] <+Veraverse> So this game is basically The Order 1886 for the xbox SEX?
[2:59:51] <conleetru> says monkeyweed21
[2:59:52] <%StaceMcGate> its more boring than bad eh
[2:59:53] <dukenux> so you say... its kinda... medium?
[2:59:54] <%JamesCorck> Put Zangief back on screen. He's far more interesting than this game.
[2:59:54] <+Stormzcales_Lair> naww do a big weed and play Balan demo
[2:59:55] <servicesuspension> I can't get over her Devil Trigger shit
[2:59:55] <%pokefan9956> quit now and play RE2

[3:00:01] <%Mr_Pylon> YUP
[3:00:03] <+gimmickypizza> A six is too generous
[3:00:04] <ranarath> Now that weird mannequin was kinda cool.
[3:00:04] <+LazyBumNetwork> Big weed no. Big Mushrooms
[3:00:09] <%Starotter70> Where can you go????
[3:00:13] <%pokefan9956> quit now and switch to RE2
[3:00:13] <KingVantq> prepare for a new Schedule chat
[3:00:17] <%topendbuzza> game gave up
[3:00:18] <%Daxalog> Is this the same devs who made Ratpocalypse?
[3:00:18] <filialpails> I was interested in the parts that reminded me of stalker but this isn't that anymore
[3:00:19] <The_500lb_Child> In case you get lost in a hallway LUL
[3:00:22] <Uselesswhitenoise> GOTTA HOLD YOUR HAND PAT
[3:00:29] <Uselesswhitenoise> YOU MIGHT HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN
[3:00:29] <@SoFarFetched> she sounds bored that she found them
[3:00:31] <$Futurecity10> also the dialogue is cringe
[3:00:31] <+Veraverse> LUL
[3:00:33] <%Livelinne> Eeeeeh sounds like generic spoopy sounds to me
[3:00:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> UGGHHH
[3:00:34] <servicesuspension> that is AWFUL
[3:00:35] <marrowjuice> i actually think the worst part of this game is the glowing objective marker
[3:00:35] <Savior127> My biggest gripe is that she never shuts up.
[3:00:36] <DjFrostBite95> LUL
[3:00:36] <Uselesswhitenoise> cant have that
[3:00:36] <peachy996> How old is this character?
[3:00:39] <+Pilau32> lol
[3:00:40] <+vicar_anat> HOW?
[3:00:40] <Srthunda> ya this narration feels like it is david cage inspired
[3:00:41] <%Starotter70> HELL YE
[3:00:42] <peachy996> I'm curious
[3:00:44] <+GrinningAlex> The game doesn't trust the player to think
[3:00:45] <+JJsAdventure> Lol
[3:00:45] <allanmiri> How much do I have to donate for you to stop playing this game and play RE REV2 with Paige?
[3:00:45] <Arek_1> LUL

[3:01:00] <%whyskeywolfe> Pat what if I gave you 5 bux to play Rocket Knight Adventures instead
[3:01:02] <fuji_92> YO PAT PREDICT THE ENDING PogChamp
[3:01:03] <+professormorrigan> its the detroit android wall
[3:01:06] <Profmcstevie> HE CAN SMELL THE JUICE
[3:01:07] <servicesuspension> go back to Ninja Gaiden
[3:01:11] <+GrinningAlex> Honestly the best part I had with the game was shitting on it
[3:01:12] <lazerscraper> wheres the valve item that has that old sound
[3:01:12] <%pokefan9956> literally anything other than this would be great
[3:01:13] <@SoFarFetched> Pat is having an out of body experience with this game
[3:01:15] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think this team has much experience with the what the basis of this game is
[3:01:17] <%Livelinne> Oh noooooo The Debiiiiiiiiiil DarkMode
[3:01:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet when you find it she's gonna say "This is the thing I need to put on that thing remember"
[3:01:34] <%GarbageNirvana> It's not even like charmingly offkilter like SH2 was
[3:01:36] <mr_saturday93> I would love to see ya and Paige play RE RE 2 again. when are ya you going back to that?
[3:01:36] <%Starotter70> What's gonna happen?
[3:01:37] <%BestTeaMaker> hey, a bit of gameplay
[3:01:41] <%cowardman93> jesus christ how slow does this need to be!
[3:01:41] <peachy996> Remember cutting the flesh walls of homecoming
[3:01:44] <Decarcassor> Its not even gross.
[3:01:44] <%ArchimerCXV> is this gameplay? you're playing it yeah but is it gameplay?
[3:01:46] <+DragonArt07> I'd almost say combat would improve this game
[3:01:47] <+ThisIsLloyd> I'\ve been working thru this stream and this is a hell of a part to look back on
[3:01:51] <ralphfromdk> Man... this game feels.... old.....
[3:01:57] <+DoktorZee> oh noo :(( i was looking forward to this game its that bad
[3:01:59] <+JJsAdventure> U little fuks
[3:02:01] <+professormorrigan> u little fr*icks
[3:02:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> And there it is
[3:02:01] <peachy996> Good angle too
[3:02:02] <marrowjuice> having the game handhold the player is one of the absolute worst decisions i've seen in a horror game
[3:02:03] <%whyskeywolfe> Incredible?
[3:02:03] <%Starotter70> Sure
[3:02:03] <%Dunmarkh> LUL LUL LUL
[3:02:10] <SaltyAzteca> Precursor James?
[3:02:12] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[3:02:14] <+Pilau32> ok
[3:02:15] <peachy996> Lol
[3:02:15] <%cowardman93> hey remember how SH2 would've done that? you would've used the item and a transition would happen
[3:02:16] <+WutangchickeN> yeah but who gives a fuck
[3:02:18] <%cowardman93> jesus fuck
[3:02:19] <%Starotter70> Back to the trotting
[3:02:20] <+WutangchickeN> like srsly bored
[3:02:23] <penitentpendant> Look at all this tech demo pretending to be a game
[3:02:24] <%pokefan9956> am I crazy in that this looks like a ps3 game?
[3:02:24] <+WutangchickeN> with this game
[3:02:27] <Savior127> Didnt Silent Hill 2 or 3 did the same thing?
[3:02:29] <+0078thunder> I think this game would be a decent bit better without the CONSTANT narration
[3:02:32] <+GrinningAlex> Which game has the better flesh wall cutting. This or Homecoming?
[3:02:32] <%BoxNavy> 4Head
[3:02:33] <%Agami23> boo
[3:02:33] <%cowardman93> I had more hopes than NONE
[3:02:38] <%Mr_Pylon> Even your Medium hopes were dashed
[3:02:38] <+Veraverse> ahaaaa
[3:02:39] <Bluewolf544> MEDIOCRATES
[3:02:40] <%GarbageNirvana> Hah
[3:02:41] <iosephe> boo

[3:02:45] <Zombrocom> Boo
[3:02:46] <+IrishWeegee> -2
[3:02:46] <%Dunmarkh> remember in homecoming when this was a real puzzle?
[3:02:47] <+UnwoundCaesar70> booooooooooo
[3:02:47] <waffleandman> its not if even like a funny bad its just bad
[3:02:48] <+WutangchickeN> LAME
[3:02:48] <allanmiri> I like that the ghost world is like a big tree. That's something I haven't seen before at least even if it's not as good as it could be.
[3:02:49] <%weissguard> Game
[3:02:49] <servicesuspension> Silent Hill transitions helped hide the mystic shit, and that is great
[3:02:53] <%ArchimerCXV> this is the FIVEST OUTTA TEN GAME i've seen in a minute
[3:03:00] <penitentpendant> Mediocrates: "Don't put this tripe on me!"
[3:03:03] <%weissguard> Game's lookin' kinda mid
[3:03:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> Starting a timer

[3:03:29] <allanmiri> The incel demon!
[3:03:31] <peachy996> @GrinningAlex I really do not want to give credit to Homecoming
[3:03:31] <%Starotter70> RUN CRASH
[3:03:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Welp
[3:03:33] <%UvBenServed> Minutes, seconds
[3:03:33] <$8BitDsx> Approximately 30 seconds later..
[3:03:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> XD
[3:03:36] <+A0N33> I was about to say, five minutes seems a little generous LUL
[3:03:36] <%AdamElJefe> LUL
[3:03:37] <+GenesisKnight> bitch ass moth
[3:03:38] <%BoxNavy> WHY DOES IT TALK
[3:03:38] <servicesuspension> CRAZY TALK REQUIEM
[3:03:38] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> God, these sections are so linear. They don't even offer the illusion of choice.
[3:03:39] <%whyskeywolfe> ayyy lmao
[3:03:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> Fat lot of good that timer did
[3:03:41] <mr_saturday93> STARS
[3:03:42] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[3:03:43] <+DragonArt07> @PatStaresAt This game badly needs to make use of ,show and don't tell.
[3:03:43] <rafflespaddock> oh god
[3:03:45] <@SoFarFetched> It really feels like the game developers were afraid of dead air,if they keep making the character comment on everything.
[3:03:47] <%LymanAl> It's just a worse Pennywise
[3:03:49] <SpaceGuntank> that was 8 Seconds. contratulations
[3:03:50] <%cowardman93> as soon as I saw the game had no combat I was worried and I was fucking right to be
[3:03:50] <lazerscraper> EVILAAK
[3:03:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Too much credit given
[3:03:52] <%Dunmarkh> sounds like a dbza character
[3:03:52] <Crouton18> have you played this before?
[3:03:58] <s1rcuit> WhO CoUlD hAvE SeEn ThAt CoMiNg?!
[3:04:09] <+professormorrigan> walk :)

[3:04:12] <%BoxNavy> OH MY GOD
[3:04:14] <%Starotter70> LUL
[3:04:15] <%XeroSigmaPrime> STOP PAT
[3:04:16] <+LazyBumNetwork> I bet at the end of the game you get your medium powers irl. @patstaresat
[3:04:17] <+takutoots> LUL
[3:04:17] <+GrinningAlex> @PatStaresAt if you really want to her narration has a volume meter you can turn down but since the game is designed around it, it might fuck it up.
[3:04:17] <%redthebaron> hell yess
[3:04:20] <Bluewolf544> OH MY GOD HAHA
[3:04:20] <servicesuspension> Reminder that Heather can become a Magical Girl
[3:04:22] <+takutoots> Pat the prophet
[3:04:23] <falsecrabmeat> I feel like I would enjoy the concept art more than the game itself
[3:04:25] <Profmcstevie> You can ONLY interact with things that do something useful/plot valid
[3:04:26] <DracaenaLeaf> God dammit LUL
[3:04:26] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:04:28] <Bluewolf544> PAT NO IT'S ALREADY DEAD
[3:04:28] <%captain_thickthighs> looks like Pat's got the supernatural powers this time
[3:04:29] <penitentpendant> Oh look, Death Stranding mechanics
[3:04:30] <servicesuspension> KORE WA REQUIEM DA
[3:04:30] <NeonBleu> Pat too strong
[3:04:31] <rytisone> Pat sees the code like Neo
[3:04:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> HE IS THE PROPHET
[3:04:32] <+Sushi2k> clip it and ship it
[3:04:33] <fuji_92> KEEP DOING IT PAT, KEEP PREDICTING
[3:04:34] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:04:39] <Pookiedaexzile> bruh like Jordan in game 6
[3:04:40] <+IrishWeegee> HE'S WEAPONIZED CRAZY TALK!
[3:04:40] <%PanicSwytch> 2 for 2
[3:04:40] <+vicar_anat> Loving these predictions!
[3:04:42] <%Starotter70> I wish the monster would stop talking
[3:04:43] <$8BitDsx> This would be WAY more scary without a voice.
[3:04:44] <%Agami23> man, lost in vivo is a way better silent hill spiritual sequel than this
[3:04:46] <+nirvana227> PAT IS THE ONE
[3:04:46] <%cowardman93> wait does this game seriously have fixed camera angles but not tank controls!? What the fuck were they thinking?
[3:04:48] <mr_saturday93> His powers are too strong!
[3:04:48] <Pookiedaexzile> He can't Miss
[3:04:49] <%UvBenServed> Reverse Crazy Talk is strong today
[3:04:51] <+Pilau32> Hide from the cookie monster, he wants your cookie
[3:04:56] <Ranger747> I feel like the monster having subtitles doesnt help
[3:04:56] <+Gamefriendly> i thought that was kinda neat
[3:04:59] <%topendbuzza> like you?
[3:05:00] <falsecrabmeat> Pat has turned into the real medium
[3:05:00] <allanmiri> IF this whole game was a movie with a movie's run time then it might've been better.
[3:05:02] <+GrinningAlex> @peachy996 we all must make difficult choices sometimes
[3:05:03] <+Jaysky> I'm so glad she's narrating this :)
[3:05:03] <rafflespaddock> oh my god, pat using Epithet
[3:05:04] <Pookiedaexzile> CRAZY TALK REQUIEM
[3:05:04] <ralphfromdk> This bitch needs to duck better... her head was still in plain sight!!!
[3:05:05] <Savior127> SHE DOESNT STOP TALKING
[3:05:06] <%Undenizen> I have a feeling this game is going to do really well, and it's gonna make Pat very mad
[3:05:06] <+professormorrigan> that was ok
[3:05:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Thanks for the explanation, I didn't get it
[3:05:08] <DaKnightWarrior> PAT WITH THE READS
[3:05:08] <waffleandman> PAT keep going make it dumber
[3:05:09] <$Futurecity10> This dude sounds like Hermaus Mora
[3:05:09] <Uselesswhitenoise> pat with your experience playing horror games could you survive a real life horror situation
[3:05:10] <%BoxNavy> its fun watching someone well versed in video game horror play a bad horror game
[3:05:10] <%ArchimerCXV> This is one of those games where i want someone more dedicated than me to outline every issue for an essay
[3:05:11] <%Starotter70> Monsters are scarier when they no talk
[3:05:15] <servicesuspension> if it was a movie it would still suck
[3:05:16] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> psaHoldon psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:05:17] <+HalcyonNineThousand> There was no escape, but I escaped
[3:05:17] <+chiazam> What
[3:05:18] <%king_wragles> There is WAY too much talking, even the plot important stuff is excessive
[3:05:19] <abuse_of_zeus> gotta be a whey
[3:05:21] <ZComiX> all the narration is doing is making me believe the writers didn't have confidence
[3:05:28] <%UvBenServed> The bolt cutters, gotta get the bolt cutters
[3:05:32] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand_HF
[3:05:33] <RaidenRising> crazy talk requiem
[3:05:38] <allanmiri> ghost audio log
[3:05:39] <+AzureWolfStrke> Watching you predict what is going to happen is making the game more enjoyable.
[3:05:40] <Pookiedaexzile> HIDE AND WATCH OUR MONSTER ANIMATE
[3:05:40] <+takutoots> wait for scary to leave then procede to the right
[3:05:41] <%chiazam> OK, MAYBE NOW it'll be scary
[3:05:41] <+GrinningAlex> High octane gameplay right?
[3:05:44] <Pookiedaexzile> oh wait
[3:05:44] <+Jaysky> @ZComiX No confidence!
[3:05:46] <+HalcyonNineThousand> 3D PUZZLE PHONE
[3:05:47] <%pokefan9956> "new details have emerged"
[3:05:48] <Pookiedaexzile> he invisible
[3:05:52] <%BoxNavy> ive been playing re2 remake recently and the stealth sequence with sherry was really good
[3:05:55] <julrave> no time to explain
[3:05:56] <+Dumb_Parrot> Modern horror game indeed
[3:05:58] <Uselesswhitenoise> THE RUSSIANS
[3:06:01] <fuji_92> shit's locked
[3:06:01] <+GenesisKnight> Is that guy supposed to be Russian?
[3:06:05] <@SoFarFetched> if its taking 3+ hours to be actually scary,there might be a huge problem.
[3:06:05] <%topendbuzza> shits locked
[3:06:06] <+ReallyBigRocks> @ZComiX Which is interesting because nothing's been particularly deep or difficult to understand
[3:06:06] <julrave> this is a phonecall but there's no time
[3:06:07] <peachy996> is he supposed to be russian
[3:06:07] <bleugh> jammed
[3:06:08] <Reanimator83> Is this a full price game
[3:06:09] <lazerscraper> shits l o c k e d
[3:06:10] <rafflespaddock> that's the most boring russian i have ever heard
[3:06:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait so are they not actually speaking English rn?
[3:06:15] <servicesuspension> they need weirder shit
[3:06:16] <%cowardman93> door locked RIGHT NEXT TO THE SOLUTION MIRROR
[3:06:17] <marrowjuice> @Starotter70 i could accept the monster talking, but the voice direction they use for it does not fit the design at all. like, i would have personally used more of a whispery voice
[3:06:22] <Noogiez> @GrinningAlex medium octane sir
[3:06:27] <%BoxNavy> that is cool
[3:06:37] <%BoxNavy> this game has some stuff at least
[3:06:37] <madejustforchat> this people made layers of fear, right?
[3:06:37] <Profmcstevie> Nice tech showcase, one clap
[3:06:41] <%Arancet> theres something about this game i really want to love it, but this is just dull with a briefist flashes of really cool ideas
[3:06:41] <+HalcyonNineThousand> that‚Äôs why the frame rate sucks
[3:06:42] <+GenesisKnight> I wonder who the monster is
[3:06:43] <+Pilau32> Okay
[3:06:49] <%topendbuzza> wut?
[3:06:51] <%Livelinne> psaUp
[3:06:52] <%cowardman93> this game has cool ideas with terrible execution
[3:06:53] <peachy996> Truly living up to the name Medium
[3:06:56] <s1rcuit> that sucks actually
[3:06:56] <+Dumb_Parrot> Both worlds are constantly being processed right? It's why the resolution goes down from what I've seen
[3:06:57] <%Livelinne> psaDown
[3:06:57] <%king_wragles> There are ton of cool ideas and visuals locked inside this not great game.
[3:06:58] <servicesuspension> This game's like The Room, but it's the wrong The Room
[3:07:01] <%redthebaron> the game visually is pretty cool it just is really dumb
[3:07:01] <%pokefan9956> the monster is the friends we made along the way
[3:07:02] <%linSP> This game is like a plain bagel with sprinkles
[3:07:06] <%WaitHowDidIGetHere> Helloooooi, Bad Nurse!
[3:07:13] <waffleandman> lets show exactly where they are LUL
[3:07:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet they're both one door away
[3:07:15] <%Starotter70> LUL
[3:07:17] <+GrinningAlex> A or B, make your ''choice''
[3:07:17] <bleugh> would this necessarily need to be horor? like if it was more focused on the investigation aspect
[3:07:20] <nathorz1> is the demo on steam?
[3:07:26] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This game has some great design, but it's a bit rough otherwise
[3:07:28] <+TheMorilo> This game is basically Beyond Two Murdered: Soul suspect
[3:07:31] <%Starotter70> Never let go of their hand, you might get lost
[3:07:31] <fuji_92> shes even gave away you gotta go to the other side... oof
[3:07:32] <servicesuspension> investigation aspect?
[3:07:35] <Pookiedaexzile> No Puzzle to find the key
[3:07:38] <%cowardman93> I don't think you could
[3:07:41] <+HalcyonNineThousand> someone‚Äôs getting a prostate exam soon
[3:07:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Let that sink in
[3:07:46] <+HalcyonNineThousand> in a hotel
[3:07:46] <Reanimator83> Isthmus monster voiced by Troy Baker
[3:07:47] <Profmcstevie> No explore, only find when we say so
[3:07:47] <%topendbuzza> we done yet?
[3:07:50] <%drabberfaun535> mabye it only sucks right now because its the first level and has to be easy
[3:07:50] <Pookiedaexzile> A horro game that just gives you the key
[3:07:51] <servicesuspension> being compared to Soul Suspect is not... not a good
[3:07:51] <+GrinningAlex> It's on xbox game pass if you have it @nathorz1
[3:07:55] <%king_wragles> @linSP it's an everything bagel, but the everything refers to the seasonings the shop has on hand... which is cornmeal...
[3:08:02] <+GenesisKnight> That got dark fast
[3:08:05] <%LymanAl> I liked that
[3:08:06] <penitentpendant> The main characters doesn't... have... to comment... on every action... writers...
[3:08:09] <nathorz1> @GrinningAlex thanks
[3:08:09] <%UvBenServed> Wholesome
[3:08:12] <falsecrabmeat> Make sure your horror game has lots of handholding so it doesn't get too scary
[3:08:15] <Ranger747> Feels like they're adhering to the same mistakes Origins made
[3:08:16] <%ArchimerCXV> i really hope this is one of those games where the team can take the criticism on the chin cause jesus this needs a conversation
[3:08:34] <waffleandman> @drabberfaun535 lets hope but the narration will definitely be there
[3:08:35] <Pookiedaexzile> @penitentpendant BUT HOW WILL THE PLAYER CONNECT
[3:08:35] <%Monkeyweed21> The real puzzle is figuring out that this game sucks
[3:08:40] <+GrinningAlex> Amnesia 3 did the same damn thing. So much talking
[3:08:42] <Visorak6> Is this better than amnesia rebirth?
[3:08:47] <%BoxNavy> i am
[3:08:50] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at her Personality
[3:08:51] <fuji_92> it feels like they went " hey we got a cool va for our protagonist, well gotta use em"
[3:08:52] <Uselesswhitenoise> its the best
[3:08:53] <Bluewolf544> SeemsGood
[3:08:55] <%Starotter70> psaUp
[3:08:56] <Furxio> i think they do that.. for.. not horror players.. but that makes a bad choice.. for.. there target audices that supuse to be horror players...
[3:08:56] <Ranger747> yeye
[3:08:56] <+DragonArt07> it's good
[3:08:57] <+Pilau32> Complain more
[3:08:57] <+GrinningAlex> Looks better
[3:08:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> You think we'll ever find an area that isn't topologically just a straight corridor?
[3:08:58] <%wibbwobbler> SeemsGood
[3:08:58] <Yung_FckUp> pat is too short we gotta squeeze him. am i using this concept ive learned about a day ago correctly?
[3:08:58] <penitentpendant> Ooooof
[3:08:59] <Visorak6> yikes
[3:08:59] <fuji_92> no?
[3:08:59] <@SoFarFetched> geefThink
[3:08:59] <+takutoots> good commentary
[3:09:00] <DracaenaLeaf> oof
[3:09:01] <marrowjuice> the monster suddenly showing up in the real world was not an earned scare
[3:09:03] <%topendbuzza> oof
[3:09:04] <%Daxalog> Is Amnesia Rebirth the new Floor?
[3:09:05] <Sol_Install> it's fine
[3:09:05] <mr_saturday93> I say it's better than rebirth
[3:09:05] <majindusto> Oh shit, We Silent Hill 0rigins
[3:09:06] <TensecondTarvis> The real puzzle is allthe friends we made along the way
[3:09:06] <rytisone> what about machine for pigs?
[3:09:07] <%whyskeywolfe> You complaining is the entertainment.
[3:09:07] <%Livelinne> Yep psaUp
[3:09:09] <s1rcuit> they should've played Until Dawn for inspiration
[3:09:11] <Bluewolf544> oof
[3:09:11] <%Mr_Pylon> AR's other world was cooler
[3:09:13] <Uselesswhitenoise> people criticizing games is way more interesting then praising them
[3:09:14] <+Dumb_Parrot> LUL
[3:09:15] <waffleandman> @Monkeyweed21 LUL LUL
[3:09:15] <servicesuspension> Sadly these kind of story based games have a bunch of Youtube sycophants that will praise it to high heaven
[3:09:15] <TheViltsuZ> Amnesia Rebirth is the worst game ever made
[3:09:16] <+Kurt_0> NotLikeThis
[3:09:16] <$8BitDsx> Okay but what would happen if she took the mirror off the wall and walked around with it tho
[3:09:16] <+GrinningAlex> The only good part about Amnesia 3?
[3:09:17] <RaidenRising> wow
[3:09:21] <peachy996> Eh
[3:09:21] <pennykettle_> Oh man I loved Soma, why did they have to go back to Amnesia. Super influential game but not a great game at the same time
[3:09:22] <%BoxNavy> i feel like im watching a retsupurae video
[3:09:25] <+DragonArt07> I enjoy the commentary it's informative for me, who wants to get into the industry
[3:09:26] <+MidnightBurst12> oof
[3:09:30] <%The_Protagonist> why did she have white mushrooms on her arm tho
[3:09:30] <+storebrandcandy> Amnesia rebirth had pregnancy mechanics
[3:09:37] <peachy996> I'd put the soundtrack to this over a: rebirth
[3:09:40] <+takutoots> has the comparison already been made to Forgotten Memories?
[3:09:42] <+DoktorZee> being able to switch back and forth really takes the tension away from ever being in the Other world
[3:09:45] <+GrinningAlex> The baby
[3:09:48] <rytisone> It's reptile
[3:09:50] <+Dumb_Parrot> Press to give birth LUL
[3:09:50] <penitentpendant> Speaking of full
[3:09:56] <%DeadlyPeaks> Anyone else getting Fragile Dreams vibes? Another flawed game, but way more compelling story wise
[3:09:57] <%cowardman93> oh man, what an interesting monster design
[3:10:00] <servicesuspension> you have too much control and at the same time not enough
[3:10:03] <%Starotter70> LIKE A GLOVE
[3:10:06] <Profmcstevie> Fucking voldemort sounding ass
[3:10:06] <%Dunmarkh> if he's so cold why doesn't he just go back to hell?
[3:10:07] <WinstonFromUndertale> @8bitdsx mods delete his comment he‚Äôs said too much
[3:10:07] <+GrinningAlex> Tense AF
[3:10:09] <+LazyBumNetwork> That‚Äôs so dumb omg
[3:10:11] <%Undenizen> howlongtobeat says this is an 8 hour experience so you're about a quarter the way through
[3:10:13] <%BoxNavy> the monsters dialogue isnt even scary
[3:10:14] <peachy996> Pat, just let the scary ghost man get his nut
[3:10:15] <wrath2x> Really dislike what I'm seeing of this game. A new fixed camera horror game with amazing visuals, a good OST and a neat gameplay mechanic on paper is something I would have loved to be good. too bad it's banal in everything it does with these things
[3:10:16] <Arek_1> WHO'S FEEDING!? LUL
[3:10:16] <servicesuspension> Fragile Dream is a WAY better sadness simulator
[3:10:16] <%Starotter70> OH
[3:10:16] <majindusto> Its expected that you will nitpick the SHIT out of this game
[3:10:17] <Sol_Install> MonkaS

[3:10:21] <rafflespaddock> horror pun??
[3:10:22] <%cowardman93> would've been really scary if I could SEE THE MONSTER
[3:10:23] <wrath2x> like a glove? ok ace ventura
[3:10:24] <%Livelinne> shiaYikes
[3:10:26] <+vicar_anat> oh no he wants to possess you
[3:10:26] <%The_Protagonist> so if you are the other girl you can see the monsters or
[3:10:27] <allanmiri> It's half moon head baphomet
[3:10:27] <SpaceGuntank> so bad its scary
[3:10:34] <+Kurt_0> doodStare
[3:10:38] <ralphfromdk> How can a game with so little going on, run so bad?
[3:10:39] <+gimmickypizza> fortunately it's not a full price game
[3:10:40] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> I think they took "never show the monster" a little too far
[3:10:41] <peachy996> Horny ghost
[3:10:41] <julrave> the monster kinda talks like an old school Disney villain
[3:10:43] <%BoxNavy> oh my god
[3:10:43] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I‚Äôm enjoying watching this suck
[3:10:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> And then the big monster walks away without looking at the one spot you could be hiding
[3:10:49] <servicesuspension> he talks like a power rangers monster
[3:10:54] <%watts121> It's a Japanese thing.
[3:10:59] <Zourath> "I'm Big Scary, so scary you guys, words words words!"
[3:11:05] <Sunstalker> It's so ghosts can't tell you your breath stinks$
[3:11:06] <allanmiri> This demon gives incel vibes
[3:11:07] <%BinaryFireball> so it doesnt make sense to have the monster be invisible now after you have already seen him
[3:11:07] <servicesuspension> Someone played DP
[3:11:09] <+Kurt_0> It‚Äôs spoopy
[3:11:12] <%The_Protagonist> how do you
[3:11:13] <DracaenaLeaf> Dork LUL
[3:11:14] <peachy996> No way Goldar is more eloquent than this chump
[3:11:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> oop walked right into him
[3:11:16] <Noogiez> hes like a ghost/predator
[3:11:16] <%Starotter70> Oh boy
[3:11:18] <%topendbuzza> (sigh)
[3:11:19] <%The_Protagonist> even tell where the fuck it is with that camera angle
[3:11:20] <s1rcuit> SHUT UP its SUSPENSE
[3:11:20] <%cowardman93> wow if only you could see the fucking thing
[3:11:21] <%BoxNavy> what do i know, pat? :)
[3:11:22] <%redthebaron> that was so dumb
[3:11:23] <Noogiez> somewhere in the middle
[3:11:24] <%Starotter70> Time to do it again
[3:11:25] <$Futurecity10> welp, thats a good ending
[3:11:26] <%Agami23> stealth invisible enemies
[3:11:26] <+Gamefriendly> i had a feeling he was gonna double back, but its hard to see that
[3:11:26] <%Mr_Pylon> A different animation would be nice
[3:11:28] <+snausages_> So is this game a bit shit then
[3:11:29] <servicesuspension> I meant the bad voice
[3:11:30] <pennykettle_> How far into the game is this?
[3:11:32] <ZComiX> it all ends and me sounds like something Shadow the Hedgehog would say
[3:11:33] <+Dumb_Parrot> I like that it's fixed camera and the graphics are great, I guess. But is the game just hiding from the same invisible monster in different rooms?
[3:11:33] <%captain_thickthighs> this seems fun...
[3:11:36] <Bluewolf544> That was so underwhelming
[3:11:37] <rytisone> invisiblessed
[3:11:37] <wrath2x> why is the jersey devil invisible?
[3:11:38] <Savior127> The monster VA sounds like the Fishing Hamlet Priest in Bloodborne
[3:11:40] <fuji_92> just a little
[3:11:43] <+DoktorZee> now we have to hear his bullshit MULTIPLE TIMES
[3:11:45] <%redthebaron> can you use spirit vision
[3:11:47] <%BoxNavy> but its scary :)
[3:11:47] <+GrinningAlex> Instinct button helps but it does something dumb @PatStaresAt
[3:11:49] <%Livelinne> S*mp Demon DarkMode
[3:11:49] <%Monkeyweed21> just use the Sword Legion on him
[3:11:51] <%BinaryFireball> you can see the outline
[3:11:54] <$8BitDsx> Naw there's a bit of a silhouette. Just a bit.
[3:11:54] <servicesuspension> I think we bled like 700 viewers
[3:11:54] <+Veraverse> V o r e
[3:11:55] <penitentpendant> There's screen blur but that's about it
[3:11:55] <lionsignal> monster is voiced by troy baker
[3:11:56] <%BoxNavy> AN ARROW
[3:11:56] <%Starotter70> At least they didn't make you do the whole sequence
[3:11:56] <%cowardman93> they just didn't texture the fucking thing
[3:11:57] <pennykettle_> I thought the ENTIRE gimmick was being able to see both worlds. Is it a plot point that she can't see him right now?
[3:11:57] <%BoxNavy> FUCK OFF
[3:12:00] <servicesuspension> this game's fucking boring

[3:12:50] <%Pojinn> she sounds so bored about everything
[3:12:51] <+DragonArt07> they showed his appearance earlier, there's no reason to hide it in spirit vision
[3:12:52] <+Gamefriendly> LUL yeah true she dgaf
[3:12:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> Glad she talks the instant the stealth is over so you know there
[3:12:53] <servicesuspension> please tell me this wasn't kickstarted
[3:12:54] <allanmiri> @ryukosbuns I'd say that Pat is 2 and a half hours in give or take.
[3:12:56] <Aracon_> I love when my protagonist doesn't care about what's happening :)
[3:12:58] <bleugh> yeah there's some tonal whiplash alright

[3:13:25] <+HalcyonNineThousand> No more handys sie
[3:13:26] <+professormorrigan> aloooneuh
[3:13:28] <tanarath> Look Pat, she's worked in Retail, this isn't any different.
[3:13:30] <+Veraverse> This game is making me miss Control
[3:13:31] <+Kurt_0> Speeen
[3:13:39] <+nirvana227> Kappa
[3:13:39] <Bluewolf544> @patstaresat You should just pop in silent hill 2 at this point
[3:13:40] <@SoFarFetched> did she just do a "artist formerly known as prince" joke
[3:13:41] <TheBadonkulator> If this was what deadly premonition 2 was like then i'd give it a shot
[3:13:42] <joejoelololl> Just play silent hill 4
[3:13:45] <servicesuspension> shuuut uuuuup
[3:13:46] <%BinaryFireball> oh autographs
[3:13:47] <+GrinningAlex> You can turn of her dialog infact on the volume meter
[3:13:49] <allanmiri> Would you rather play this or SH4?
[3:13:50] <%BinaryFireball> my brain is dumb
[3:13:54] <+ReallyBigRocks> @mield916 in all fairness Control was a big budget shootems game
[3:14:04] <+AzureWolfStrke> Everybody in this game talks way too much. It ruins any tension there could be
[3:14:04] <+Veraverse> Oh nooooooo
[3:14:14] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> she looks so stiff
[3:14:17] <mark_collins45> flick flocking
[3:14:18] <+Jaysky> Nonono you need the flavor text it adds so much to this game. Like... Uh... Huh. Normally it does that, doesn't it?
[3:14:19] <Arek_1> I shouldn't be saying "Shut the fuck up" at a horror game every 5 minutes...

[3:14:33] <%BoxNavy> ugh, like, super icky!
[3:14:34] <julrave> her commentary sucks man
[3:14:35] <%mield916> Remedy is not a big studio
[3:14:38] <+GrinningAlex> The otherworld in SH 1 or 3 it was a oh shit moment now it's whatever
[3:14:43] <mark_collins45> This voice actress has no urgency or emotion at all.
[3:14:52] <ElusiveStarlord> I am SO CONFUSED about how much prior knowlage marrianne HAS about this place? She seems to know everybody but nobody at the smae time?
[3:14:52] <+Dumb_Parrot> This trend of main characters constantly thinking out loud is honestly annoying. Jesus
[3:14:53] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh my god she is incapable of being anything but monotone
[3:14:54] <servicesuspension> Here's some flavor text from Silent Hill 3 for comparison: "It's bread."
[3:14:54] <%mield916> Blooper team had MICROSOFT MONEY and still fucked this up
[3:14:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> At least they totally beat the split screen thing into the ground the first time they used it and haven't touched it since
[3:14:59] <peachy996> These audio dialogues from inspecting items are a holdover from layers of fear and other popular first person horror games that didn't need to be here
[3:15:03] <allanmiri> I like that it looks like you're in a big evil tree.
[3:15:06] <%XeroSigmaPrime> OMG
[3:15:07] <julrave> I kinda wish her commentary hints were optional cause she won't stop with them

[3:16:40] <+Veraverse> @donkymagooterson yeah...
[3:16:41] <+Juggerlag> your so god damn bored lol
[3:16:46] <%watts121> Even being a Medium, you don't see a lot of shit.
[3:16:47] <+lyskaltelvanni> ROLL CREDITS
[3:16:50] <+Kurt_0> Bootch
[3:16:53] <%wibbwobbler> not being invested in the narrative is prob a bad thing lmao

[3:17:26] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt is there an option for polish dub? maybe the voice acting isn't as bad
[3:17:27] <%watts121> I already returned my copy of Steam.
[3:17:28] <%redthebaron> mother
[3:17:31] <%watts121> I played it for like 30 mins
[3:17:36] <theanora1> these answers are too jokey for a horror game
[3:17:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Stop laughing at me, Mother!
[3:17:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> Why does the phone explode? Is it ghost energy?
[3:17:40] <+Veraverse> This game hyped me up for Control, a game I've already played
[3:17:41] <+gimmickypizza> WutFace
[3:17:42] <%whyskeywolfe> What the fuck are we actually doing?
[3:17:44] <Bluewolf544> muthur
[3:17:47] <servicesuspension> I wish Woolie was here to hype
[3:17:54] <+Grayhammatter> m-mother
[3:17:56] <+gimmickypizza> is this like remothered
[3:17:57] <+Veraverse> Dead naming is sick! Hell yeah game
[3:18:05] <%Mr_Pylon> Aren't we supposed to find Tom
[3:18:09] <+thefishofwar> I fell asleep what did I miss?
[3:18:14] <s1rcuit> Whiskey Wolf is better than Tequila Wolf
[3:18:15] <majindusto> THEY'RE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU!!!
[3:18:16] <Bluewolf544> remothered ungrandmothered
[3:18:17] <+Jaysky> Neither is your va
[3:18:17] <+thefishofwar> not a joke btw
[3:18:19] <ralphfromdk> You are trying to find Thomas... because she's got nothing better to do I guess?
[3:18:19] <+professormorrigan> Remediumed: Tormented Pats
[3:18:20] <+storebrandcandy> It‚Äôs fine
[3:18:21] <peachy996> Next Bit
[3:18:26] <+HalcyonNineThousand> Vivenne?
[3:18:26] <penitentpendant> A shame you can't refund this
[3:18:28] <Dactic> Not every day i make it to a pat stream
[3:18:28] <+JesusFromSpace> Victoria
[3:18:29] <%Dakuu75> Victoria? or Vivian?
[3:18:30] <%watts121> Victoria if you want to trigger her.
[3:18:31] <Waldo_landfill> why is our character quipping so much
[3:18:35] <%whyskeywolfe> @s1rcuit I was the wolf they fed
[3:18:41] <+Jaysky> Has Pat tried Remothered? It's a claaaasic
[3:18:41] <+MugenSandan> but Pat you learned all her EMOSHUNS
[3:18:42] <+Juggerlag> "Not exactly a hot bed of passion" The quote that sums up this game
[3:18:45] <+HalcyonNineThousand> it‚Äôs eilliot
[3:18:46] <%Dakuu75> -welp, rip chat
[3:18:47] <+Veraverse> @thefishofwar you had a better time resting, I believe
[3:18:48] <+Pilau32> ???
[3:18:51] <%chiazam> WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH THE BOLT CUTTERS
[3:18:52] <%Arancet> serious question: since coming here at the start of the game, has the main character advances her story line in ANY WAY?
[3:18:53] <%snugglepuggs> Tori is a lame nickname for Victoria
[3:18:55] <%watts121> Tori is short for Victoria...it's all coming together
[3:18:55] <Bluewolf544> ????
[3:18:55] <+GenesisKnight> Stop narrating everything
[3:18:56] <Savior127> ????????
[3:18:56] <%Starotter70> uhhhhhhhhh
[3:18:57] <%RyderTokage> Did David Cage write this?
[3:19:02] <tattleworm> kusotori
[3:19:03] <+Dumb_Parrot> Legit question, are there moments of silence in this game? I feel like this game suffers from ADHD
[3:19:06] <+Grayhammatter> wait, what the fuck is happening?
[3:19:08] <Bluewolf544> GET THE BOLT CUTTERS LADY
[3:19:09] <%Undenizen> "Victory"
[3:19:09] <+HalcyonNineThousand> I DONT understand
[3:19:11] <+lyskaltelvanni> Nicknames you like are your REAL NAME lol
[3:19:13] <+storebrandcandy> Toriel?
[3:19:14] <%Livelinne> Tori Amos
[3:19:20] <%LymanAl> I don't think she chose it
[3:19:20] <%redthebaron> art
[3:19:21] <+gimmickypizza> David Cage wrote much better than this
[3:19:24] <rytisone> girls are crazy
[3:19:25] <%Undenizen> maybe she didn't choose her stage name
[3:19:26] <+Veraverse> Because yeah
[3:19:26] <+GenesisKnight> She probably didn't choose the stage name
[3:19:28] <%snugglepuggs> beacuse she caught the stupid
[3:19:29] <Uselesswhitenoise> no don't ask question just feel these emotions
[3:19:29] <%ssjklyco> Who knows, Angriest Pat
[3:19:34] <%watts121> Man they really gave up on the split screen gimmick.
[3:19:39] <allanmiri> I guess she didn't get to choose and it was the manager or something.
[3:19:40] <Bluewolf544> @gimmickypizza Hey let's not get crazy
[3:19:40] <+takutoots> wait is this the same place?
[3:19:41] <rafflespaddock> Icky Vicky
[3:19:42] <%Dakuu75> @gimmickypizza you sure?
[3:19:45] <@SoFarFetched> no stop
[3:19:46] <Savior127> +
[3:19:47] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Id rather watch Beyond TTwo Souls XD
[3:19:53] <%Mr_Pylon> Is she getting quieter or is it just more boring?
[3:20:01] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna see
[3:20:03] <marrowjuice> wait, did they really just get rid of the split screen gimmick?
[3:20:06] <Uselesswhitenoise> i miss the split screen gimmick
[3:20:06] <servicesuspension> She's falling asleep
[3:20:06] <+gimmickypizza> I'm definitely sure, heavy rain is better beyond two souls is better Detroit is better
[3:20:07] <Bluewolf544> @mr_pylon yes
[3:20:10] <%LymanAl> WHy won't they put something in the window
[3:20:11] <penitentpendant> I'd rather watch him finish Cyber Shadow
[3:20:14] <%Dakuu75> yes, the boring, is getting louder
[3:20:14] <+HalcyonNineThousand> the voice actress is getting more bored
[3:20:14] <%chiazam> Who told you she picked out Vivienne
[3:20:17] <%LymanAl> GUess there'll be a thired time
[3:20:19] <+MugenSandan> Zangief has learned to become water from Elmer
[3:20:22] <Decarcassor> Way too much inner monologue and the actress wasn't given any direction... :/
[3:20:23] <%Livelinne> Full Gief stream when psaGiefrail psaDogchamp
[3:20:23] <+LazyBumNetwork> I wonder how hard it really is to direct a decent game. I wish there was a documentary on it.
[3:20:24] <TensecondTarvis> and to think, its only a 6-8 hour game of NOTHING HAPPENING
[3:20:26] <julrave> I miss Yakuza 7...
[3:20:26] <KaitlynnHere> I wanna see the melting dog, it‚Äôs probably more entertaining than this game
[3:20:35] <+gimmickypizza> Where's the Elmo loaf
[3:20:37] <%G_Thunders> This actually reminds me of Murdered Soul Suspect
[3:20:37] <+DoktorZee> Coraline felt more impactful then this
[3:20:39] <bleugh> you are all free now
[3:20:41] <Bluewolf544> Give dog
[3:20:45] <+DoktorZee> BETTER GET TO IT
[3:20:50] <rjhascancer> are we having fun? @PatStaresAt
[3:20:50] <ZComiX> do you think the reason we're doing the mirror swapping is because they realize thathaving two characters on the same screen was too intensive for their game
[3:20:53] <%whyskeywolfe> I feel like the most this game can hope for is a dissapointed Mandalore Gaming review.
[3:20:53] <%Livelinne> StinkyCheese StinkyCheese StinkyCheese
[3:20:55] <%RyderTokage> dark
[3:20:56] <+Shady_Zaku> BIG SLEEP
[3:20:56] <allanmiri> @DoktorZee Coraline was awesome!
[3:20:59] <julrave> @DoktorZee that's cause Coraline is a good movie
[3:21:00] <%Spydurman> what happened to finding Thomas???
[3:21:01] <servicesuspension> Victoria was so thankful to be out of this game
[3:21:03] <%Daxalog> Ya winnin son?
[3:21:04] <%watts121> illconcieved.
[3:21:07] <%cowardman93> oh hey it's the drawings from Homecoming
[3:21:07] <+AzureWolfStrke> This is honestly just making me want to play the original Silent Hill games again.
[3:21:11] <Arek_1> Don't let her find peace. She sounds like a bitch. LUL
[3:21:13] <%ssjklyco> It's a Medium on the fun scale
[3:21:13] <Srthunda> For a game that likes talking to you, I realy did not understand why that name was important until the end
[3:21:13] <+sweatypalms_btw> Aggressively Mediocre
[3:21:14] <+tadok0ro> so much of this dialogue felt like the writers demanded it to be there when it would've been beneficial to cut
[3:21:16] <%BoxNavy> ahhh!!! :)
[3:21:18] <KaitlynnHere> @spydurman now they‚Äôre Vivian
[3:21:20] <KingVantq> It is the Medium tdogSmile
[3:21:21] <%snugglepuggs> what IS fun? not this thats for sure
[3:21:21] <+DoktorZee> it WAS an awesome movie exactly lol
[3:21:21] <$Calval1er> Why does the otherworld look so much like woolies house?
[3:21:22] <donkymagooterson> I hear horror happening
[3:21:22] <+GenesisKnight> wow that voice acting LUL
[3:21:23] <+Shady_Zaku> Ruinously mediocre lmao
[3:21:23] <T_Sasquatch> i feel like ive never seen pat wear a hoodie
[3:21:24] <gallohuegos> I thought the art looked cool but this is pretty boring
[3:21:25] <%Starotter70> What makes you say that
[3:21:27] <+Veraverse> What a twist
[3:21:31] <%Arancet> i like so much about the idea of this game and so little about the reality
[3:21:32] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> would you say this game is medium ?
[3:21:33] <KaitlynnHere> Eeeeehhhhhh!
[3:21:35] <Visorak6> Waist high walls? What is this, gears of war or a horror game?
[3:21:41] <%Daxalog> What are you playing on Saturday than?
[3:21:42] <%LymanAl> If only there were a mirror next door
[3:21:42] <+MugenSandan> Pat is probably not having fun playing it, but I'm having lots of fun watching him not have fun
[3:21:46] <mark_collins45> That run animation is unfortunate
[3:21:50] <KaitlynnHere> Game design is hard
[3:21:54] <tanarath> what a ~tweest~
[3:21:54] <pennykettle_> This idea should just have been a Stranger Things game
[3:21:55] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt It seems like a 5-6/10 at best. Not bad, but also not really good?
[3:21:57] <%watts121> But the game doesn't even feel scary.
[3:21:58] <%megaman_sentinel> is that climbing animation
[3:22:00] <servicesuspension> her run is so awkward
[3:22:00] <penitentpendant> Everything got poured into the visual design
[3:22:00] <T_Sasquatch> it looks like she has a devil bringer ... plus white hair ... hmmm
[3:22:02] <+Dumb_Parrot> Gaming : "There were too many of us, we had access to too much equipment, too much money, and little by little we went insane. "
[3:22:08] <%redthebaron> the jog absolutelly still drives me insane
[3:22:08] <Bluewolf544> She runs like she shit her pants
[3:22:12] <ranarath> Bless you!
[3:22:13] <+Veraverse> bless you
[3:22:14] <Bluewolf544> reminds me of andromeda
[3:22:14] <Oxybe> Ah yes. the Spooky Mushroom dimention.
[3:22:16] <rafflespaddock> bless you
[3:22:17] <+Gamefriendly> that scared me more than the game
[3:22:17] <%baka_sugoi> bless
[3:22:19] <%StaceMcGate> bless you
[3:22:20] <+GenesisKnight> that sneeze scared me more than anything in the game has
[3:22:21] <%snugglepuggs> i dont know who sounds boreder. Pat playing this game or the main character of the game
[3:22:22] <Arek_1> Bless you.
[3:22:24] <Swimmingrock> That sneeze was way scarier than the game.
[3:22:24] <+AzureWolfStrke> bless you
[3:22:24] <%Spydurman> JASON
[3:22:27] <%Livelinne> Blessh
[3:22:30] <Bluewolf544> Bless you
[3:22:31] <Psyramics> i thought you were jumpscaring at something
[3:22:44] <KaitlynnHere> Bless you God boi
[3:22:46] <julrave> can you just list all the names off in order with the mask?
[3:22:47] <%slaughtedlamb> bet, he was killed by jilted lover
[3:22:48] <%BoxNavy> no :)
[3:22:49] <Savior127> "Huh.. Chairs.. Chairs for people to sit on. Not bad."
[3:22:54] <+Kurt_0> How‚Äôs the soundtrack
[3:22:58] <peachy996> I thought that name said Baraka
[3:23:00] <%SirGO0SE> @Bluewolf544 its the run that you do when people are watching and you dont want to show them you actually running LUL
[3:23:01] <+Skelegroove> What's stopping her from just going one by one
[3:23:14] <+LazyBumNetwork> Are we back into the era of interesting game teasers to awful games?
[3:23:16] <KasiCrafter> ACTUAL puzzle?
[3:23:17] <+Veraverse> @kurt_0 it's the best part so far
[3:23:17] <%BoxNavy> fuckin boris

[3:23:30] <%redthebaron> BOORIS
[3:23:31] <rjhascancer> hes the guy!
[3:23:32] <+Gamefriendly> I wonder if this game's going to have any cool speedrun stuff
[3:23:32] <Snowfellow> I'm... the guy
[3:23:36] <marrowjuice> fuck boris
[3:23:40] <julrave> You're free Aaron Abernathy, you're free Alex Borischuk, you're free-
[3:23:40] <rjhascancer> you're the guy?
[3:23:41] <%boxboten> boxboten subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! have some tendies courtesy of $GME
[3:23:42] <servicesuspension> all my homies hate boris
[3:23:44] <%Livelinne> Iiiiits Boris
[3:23:51] <%snow_bush> Mark Hammel?
[3:23:54] <Profmcstevie> NO BRAIN, JUST BUTTONS
[3:23:56] <mark_collins45> Bore us, isn't that what this game is called LUL
[3:24:03] <+Jaysky> Listen Pat SOME people aren't able to thunk
[3:24:08] <rafflespaddock> what was i thinking?? 8 is not 9
[3:24:08] <%watts121> Shut up bitch, this is my puzzle!
[3:24:08] <Bluewolf544> More like Boring is amirite Kappa
[3:24:19] <heartlesshealer> puzzle denied
[3:24:19] <TensecondTarvis> he die in a conference room?
[3:24:23] <%SirGO0SE> Resident Evil 2 solving who sits in what chair is more of a puzzle LUL
[3:24:24] <AllonBachuth> NotLikeThis
[3:24:24] <servicesuspension> is this how it feels to play Silent Hill on easy
[3:24:25] <%Starotter70> If they keep this up, they might just trick us into thinking there's gameplay
[3:24:25] <%king_wragles> Has there even been a REAL puzzle yet? You're like 2.5 hours in
[3:24:27] <tattleworm> it's only a puzzle when you've gotta put a gear in a thing
[3:24:28] <+Veraverse> Shut up tho, look at the SSD technology
[3:24:29] <TensecondTarvis> tough meeting i guess
[3:24:31] <penitentpendant> @Bluewolf544 A joke more inspired than this game
[3:24:32] <%redthebaron> i love to watch the mc doing the puzzle for me that is nice
[3:24:32] <%AdamElJefe> So much hand holding
[3:24:34] <heartlesshealer> I hate these anti-puzzles
[3:24:34] <+GenesisKnight> This suuuuucks
[3:24:35] <Uselesswhitenoise> i have played games for small cildren with less handholding
[3:24:37] <%baka_sugoi> bad puzzle
[3:24:37] <BlkFlameKami> this could've been an email
[3:24:39] <%thomassolorio> sad
[3:24:39] <+MugenSandan> wait so they dont even let you just look at the page and figure it out they just TELL you
[3:24:39] <auraoftheearth009> He died after the soup
[3:24:42] <%BoxNavy> oh god moon2W
[3:24:42] <+DragonArt07> wasted potential is my pet peeve
[3:24:44] <%Dakuu75> that was like an MMO quest, where you jsut examine tand talk to everyone/everything multiple times
[3:24:46] <%BoxNavy> huh
[3:24:47] <rytisone> amazing
[3:24:47] <%Mr_Pylon> HAHAHAHA
[3:24:48] <%RyderTokage> WHAT THE FUCK
[3:24:48] <marrowjuice> the level of handholding is literally the WORST thing you could do to a game with puzzle elements
[3:24:48] <rjhascancer> stinky aass soul
[3:24:48] <+LazyBumNetwork> No real gameplay 2.5 hours in.
[3:24:49] <%LymanAl> USE THE ARROW
[3:24:49] <+vicar_anat> man I already miss Phelps tapping with his finger on things
[3:24:49] <%Starotter70> COOL
[3:24:50] <%thomassolorio> peothetic
[3:24:50] <tattleworm> it's ya boy
[3:24:51] <+Grayhammatter> F
[3:24:52] <+Pilau32> lmfaooo
[3:24:52] <Cal_ixo> I hate her little jog and her voice
[3:24:53] <%UvBenServed> Your soul is stinky
[3:24:53] <%Starotter70> YEEES
[3:24:53] <+Veraverse> Minecraft has more decision making
[3:24:54] <Profmcstevie> INVISIBLE GHOST
[3:24:55] <%BestTeaMaker> F
[3:24:55] <+Dumb_Parrot> I like the technical aspects of this game, seems to have a nice camera and such. But man, a character that's consntantly talking needs to be, you know... engaging
[3:24:55] <+Pilau32> wtf
[3:24:55] <+GenesisKnight> It all ends in me
[3:24:56] <+Veraverse> WHAT
[3:24:56] <%The_Protagonist> what
[3:24:57] <%Starotter70> LUL
[3:24:57] <Bluewolf544> Ive heard people play melty in the mirror universe

[3:25:01] <rjhascancer> your soul reeks
[3:25:01] <+TheCoobie> Nice lol
[3:25:02] <rafflespaddock> what??
[3:25:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I cant wait for RE Village, a good horror game with tons of enemies and puzzles
[3:25:03] <heartlesshealer> It feels like they wanted a movie instead of a game
[3:25:03] <servicesuspension> FUB
[3:25:03] <Oxybe> LUL
[3:25:04] <donkymagooterson> that was more confusing that scary
[3:25:04] <%wibbwobbler> f
[3:25:04] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm reminded of a Barney the dinosaur game I saw for the Genesis which just starts playing itself if you leave it alone for long enough
[3:25:04] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[3:25:05] <servicesuspension> FUN
[3:25:05] <ZComiX> I am all that I am all that I am
[3:25:05] <+Gamefriendly> im with you, but the audio que did sound like he was in front
[3:25:05] <%thomassolorio> die
[3:25:05] <silverira> WHY IN FRONT
[3:25:06] <Visorak6> I feel like this game has a quota of forced deaths per hour
[3:25:11] <%cowardman93> if only you could see him
[3:25:12] <KasiCrafter> Looks like the flashlight blinks faster the closer he is to you.
[3:25:14] <%Livelinne> Oh nooooo
[3:25:15] <peachy996> someone get this guy an onahole or something
[3:25:16] <+Juggerlag> lol
[3:25:16] <tanarath> this feels like a shitstorm game
[3:25:16] <+LazyBumNetwork> Same animation and death states
[3:25:20] <%Mr_Pylon> gotta use your targetting reticule
[3:25:21] <servicesuspension> you died, that makes this a game
[3:25:22] <peachy996> OR onasoul
[3:25:22] <%watts121> It's cuz you aren't a Medium Pat, only mediums like me can see him
[3:25:23] <T_Sasquatch> @Veraverse is that meant to be a joke ? because minecraft is built on decision making LUL
[3:25:27] <%thomassolorio> maybe fall through the hole
[3:25:29] <rafflespaddock> i can smell your soul??

[3:35:20] <bleugh> EVERYBODY LAUGH
[3:35:21] <Pookiedaexzile> YEYEYEYE
[3:35:21] <ExpressNode> At least cyberpunk you can laugh at but this game is just painful

[3:35:29] <+MugenSandan> is she THE PETER GRIFFIN OF HORROR GAMES JESUS
[3:35:31] <%BinaryFireball> is there even glass in that door/
[3:35:32] <+thefishofwar> DON'T CRACK WISE IN SILENT HILL MISS
[3:35:36] <+survivalone> what the hell, that chain opening thing is so like RE7
[3:35:36] <Pookiedaexzile> NATALIE FILLION
[3:35:36] <Giztech> no matter how much you try she will also get the last word lol
[3:35:38] <%AdamElJefe> YEAH, levity in my horror game, that's what I want
[3:35:39] <%MoguManda> if she never talked this game would be a bit better
[3:35:41] <+survivalone> Its exactly the same
[3:35:42] <@SoFarFetched> This REALLY is starting to feel like the game developers were afraid of dead air.
[3:35:42] <%redthebaron> marriane what the fuck you are in danger why are you just doing bits
[3:35:45] <MrBaldachin> yeah it literally has the same flippant protagonist as other action-adventure 3rd person games
[3:35:46] <bleugh> why the fuck is she called SADNESS
[3:35:46] <KingVantq> uncharted actually has decent gameplay they forgot that
[3:35:46] <BlueSpartan119> CAPITAL S Sadness
[3:35:47] <%thomassolorio> talking to one's self ...... really game
[3:35:48] <Zourath> No Bit, stop with all bits forever, miss.
[3:35:48] <Pookiedaexzile> NATALIE DRAKE
[3:35:51] <dynamic_funk> WTF?
[3:35:54] <%Starotter70> Or they can make you move faster than a small trot
[3:36:01] <wrath2x> the real horror is having to hear the inner thoughts of a very boring protagonist making jokes that'd have dad's cringe
[3:36:01] <+strakillias> Is there a harder difficulty that will shut her up or will that be DLC?
[3:36:03] <ralphfromdk> Couldn't they have given her a spirit friend or something... Spirit butterfly that talks to her?
[3:36:03] <TheAntiNihilist> Level Design is at an all time low
[3:36:05] <AllonBachuth> Gamespot gave this a 9/10
[3:36:06] <+ThomasOfTroy> Would you like this game better if the dialogue volume was set to zero and the subtitles were turned out?
[3:36:08] <silverira> can't wait for a mod in this game where they take out 80% of her lines
[3:36:09] <%cowardman93> $10 for you to quit right now
[3:36:10] <Bluewolf544> 100%
[3:36:12] <Savior127> YUP
[3:36:14] <%Livelinne> joofbSweat
[3:36:18] <%Spydurman> any one else getting frame drops?? Cause it's looking GREAT LUL
[3:36:18] <+smuggleruncle> imagine until dawn but every 60 seconds they crack a dumb joke
[3:36:18] <AllonBachuth> PC Gamer gave this a 92/100
[3:36:21] <Pookiedaexzile> WHo says randomly "Okay, My own name. "
[3:36:22] <aluddss> wouldn't doubt it
[3:36:23] <+tadok0ro> I really dislike this sort of flippant but trying too hard sort of dialogue
[3:36:24] <+survivalone> @PatStaresAt How's this game so far, worth buying?
[3:36:24] <heartlesshealer> it's close if not
[3:36:24] <+nirvana227> why did those chains melt?
[3:36:25] <%watts121> It removes all the horror aspects when she is so nonchalant about it.
[3:36:26] <%Starotter70> Oh yeah
[3:36:27] <Bluewolf544> @allonbachuth Gamespot can eat shit
[3:36:28] <Aracon_> fuck your immersion hggLul
[3:36:29] <+smuggleruncle> WOW
[3:36:30] <%Dakuu75> they would

[3:36:33] <+Grayhammatter> she disappeared...
[3:36:34] <%sniffy77> ...is pat gonna need to change the schedule again?
[3:36:35] <+Jaysky> None out of ten?
[3:36:36] <Giztech> even more so than KOTOR
[3:36:37] <servicesuspension> Half of the problems is the dialogue, but even without them it's still bad
[3:36:38] <+GenesisKnight> Here we go again
[3:36:39] <Uselesswhitenoise> PILLS
[3:36:39] <%cowardman93> God Hand 4/10
[3:36:40] <AllonBachuth> Techradar gave this a 4.5/5

[3:36:49] <rafflespaddock> finally, marketing material
[3:36:49] <%whyskeywolfe> but what if there was a spooky girl with one arm
[3:36:51] <Waldo_landfill> @PatStaresAt I keep expecting her to say aloud "This door is locked form the other side."
[3:36:52] <TheAntiNihilist> SUBJECTIIIIVE
[3:36:53] <%watts121> This is a 7 at most.
[3:36:53] <%snugglepuggs> a lot of places and reviewer gave it a 9/10
[3:36:55] <%thomassolorio> some people have hittler a 9 out of 10
[3:36:56] <Aracon_> what terrible editing
[3:36:57] <+waltzqueen> ??????
[3:36:58] <+survivalone> What is this david cage camera usage
[3:37:00] <ExpressNode> How long is this game?
[3:37:02] <%fishmonger555> they should've put a mask on her too.
[3:37:06] <Sunstalker> Why her eyes gotta look so dead.
[3:37:06] <dynamic_funk> oh my god....

[3:37:16] <+Jaysky> Rage Shadow Legends?
[3:37:17] <%Sargonyx> I dont understand the split screen during cutscenes. what's interesting in the material world during this?
[3:37:20] <+thefishofwar> anger...2!!!!
[3:37:20] <%Starotter70> of Africa\
[3:37:22] <%baka_sugoi> rage against the machine

[3:37:24] <%Mr_Pylon> Shame Sith, got it
[3:37:24] <%BoxNavy> ACG gave this a "wait for a deep sale" and even that is incorrect
[3:37:25] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> most places gave this game like 6 or 7
[3:37:25] <Aracon_> why even have 2 perspectives
[3:37:28] <+Gamefriendly> LUL the game is explaining rage
[3:37:33] <%watts121> Yeah...she is the thing.
[3:37:34] <TheAntiNihilist> Shame...SHAME...rage.but anger...
[3:37:35] <Pookiedaexzile> How could tGamespot hate it, theres no combos
[3:37:38] <+survivalone> @Sargonyx They are basically copying heavy rain lols
[3:37:41] <%Livelinne> Soooooo....it is incel

[3:38:05] <+survivalone> RICHARD nooooo
[3:38:06] <%baka_sugoi> S p 0 o k Y
[3:38:07] <pennykettle_> I can't deal with empty platitude dialogue like this anymore. Vague appeals to concepts instead of concrete stories
[3:38:07] <+Dumb_Parrot> At least they're showing off their tech eh?
[3:38:08] <+MugenSandan> child focus on ORB it will keep you SAFE
[3:38:09] <%RaziWraith> umm why are there two perspectives if stuff is only happening in one of them?
[3:38:09] <%Broand> DAYROOM, FIGHTER OF THE NIGHTROOM
[3:38:15] <+Dumb_Parrot> Rendering everything all the time
[3:38:20] <sydowoodo> how long is this game?
[3:38:20] <Maxicqwe> at least the game is trying you can't deny that
[3:38:20] <ralphfromdk> As in.... daycare? is that just a janky translation?
[3:38:24] <%whyskeywolfe> Oh my God are we only NOW getting to Richard?
[3:38:28] <+waltzqueen> A HOLLOW
[3:38:29] <Bluewolf544> LOOK AT OUR COOL TECH
[3:38:29] <+survivalone> This is legit so bad
[3:38:29] <servicesuspension> it's 2020, we have autoblows, this is not impressive anymore
[3:38:32] <%BoxNavy> im becoming hollow listening to this moon2SOOFER
[3:38:33] <servicesuspension> 2021, fuck
[3:38:35] <servicesuspension> even worse
[3:38:38] <Giztech> so throw paint on the evil thing and you can see it lol
[3:38:39] <%ArchimerCXV> i feel like this screen is only split to pretnd to be more itneresting - there sint anything you're missing in the real world
[3:38:39] <+survivalone> looks like complete shit, like an asset flip
[3:38:40] <+Jaysky> Is he the monster?
[3:38:41] <%Starotter70> Is this a secret Bleach game?
[3:38:42] <+Goku01899> Bleach? Kappa
[3:38:46] <%baka_sugoi> BAD MAN
[3:38:47] <Aracon_> hggSleep

[3:39:00] <%topendbuzza> she did?
[3:39:06] <%The_Protagonist> her name is Sadness tho
[3:39:06] <+Snazzy_Tomato> I MUST CONVINENTLY LEAVE OUT DETAILS TO CREATE SUSPENSE FOR LATER
[3:39:07] <+MugenSandan> they are trying so hard to save time by not rendering that ball in both worlds the whole time
[3:39:07] <%Broand> the big fleshy thing
[3:39:07] <dynamic_funk> WTF?
[3:39:08] <TensecondTarvis> NO SHIT
[3:39:08] <%BoxNavy> your special eyes
[3:39:09] <+DoktorZee> STOP NARRATING
[3:39:09] <AllonBachuth> It was then I realized
[3:39:10] <%Mr_Pylon> what?
[3:39:10] <Bluewolf544> More monologues SeemsGood
[3:39:10] <+survivalone> who wrote this dialogue, david cage's son?
[3:39:10] <TheAntiNihilist> Byeeeeee
[3:39:11] <%megaman_sentinel> really?
[3:39:11] <Oxybe> Mushrooms?
[3:39:13] <@SoFarFetched> "it all started with a dead girl"
[3:39:13] <Vallacondios> AM i a joke to you?
[3:39:14] <peachy996> MMMMMYESSS TELL ME WHAT YOU REALIZED
[3:39:14] <maskedmook> why does she care about Sad
[3:39:15] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Wooo so bad
[3:39:15] <+GenesisKnight> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:39:16] <dynamic_funk> Why did she say that?
[3:39:17] <+vicar_anat> im starting to think emotions are a theme....
[3:39:19] <+thefishofwar> sadness be like AIGHT BYE
[3:39:20] <%Livelinne> psaBig sad
[3:39:20] <SunsetJack> This inner dialogue is giving me other m vibes and I am hating it.
[3:39:21] <heartlesshealer> Realized JUST NOW???
[3:39:21] <servicesuspension> What's with her jacket, does it have a tribal design
[3:39:22] <%CapnClassix> This feels like the added narration in Blade Runner
[3:39:24] <+rainlily1245> @PatStaresAt this is just the original theatrical cut of blade runner with the harrison ford narration
[3:39:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Bitch she dead, how you gonna save her
[3:39:28] <+Pilau32> Sadness literrally just said DONT
[3:39:28] <TheAntiNihilist> Just stamp
[3:39:33] <+Dumb_Parrot> @ArchimerCXV clearly just showing off that they're rendering both worlds at the same time
[3:39:35] <anAngryHamster> The other world can't be scary when the protagonist interacts with so casually
[3:39:36] <TheAntiNihilist> Stawp
[3:39:37] <peachy996> @SunsetJack I see it too
[3:39:38] <%Ranryu692> omg Pat's wearing long sleeves
[3:39:40] <%baka_sugoi> ew
[3:39:44] <UndeadManatee> floppy!
[3:39:44] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt this feels like a pretty OK Netflix Original
[3:39:51] <%Andrizzleton> this game looks like shit
[3:39:51] <+GenesisKnight> Ohhey, bugs. You know what that means
[3:39:53] <Aracon_> jesus these cuts
[3:39:55] <Profmcstevie> I'd prefer if she called him dick
[3:39:57] <+Grayhammatter> RICCCHARD!
[3:39:58] <Srthunda> I did not realize this was a mini game at first, I thought it was just a slow animation
[3:39:59] <%watts121> wait....so what would a normal person do in that situation? See an invisible force field?
[3:40:10] <%Livelinne> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[3:40:11] <%StaceMcGate> This is Pat's GOTY 2021 right here
[3:40:17] <Manwad> this game is missing an Angela and an Eddie
[3:40:20] <Bluewolf544> @watts121 leave the building
[3:40:20] <+Dumb_Parrot> I guess this is a good tech demo
[3:40:31] <servicesuspension> consume towel
[3:40:34] <+Jamesins> Why is cutting through a wall the most interactive thing in the game?
[3:40:39] <%PanicSwytch> I hate this dual reality shit. it could be used in a better way but it just feels like a forced gimmick
[3:40:47] <peachy996> Like if you had her explain that she talks to herself so she doesn't feel so alone at the start of the game
[3:40:49] <SaltyAzteca> hows the game going so far?
[3:41:06] <%cowardman93> can we just sit and see Gief play for rest of stream? It'll be far more entertaining
[3:41:07] <+Snazzy_Tomato> detective mode
[3:41:21] <+Nahual_Amini> How's the game?
[3:41:22] <dynamic_funk> @saltyazteca not good
[3:41:23] <%BoxNavy> is richard the evil monster i havent been paying attention
[3:41:24] <+survivalone> save money cutscenes
[3:41:26] <%MoguManda> it's almost like he was a butterfly
[3:41:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Innovative Split Screen technology, it's a real different feel than all the games that switch eviorments with a single button press
[3:41:34] <%LymanAl> WE. Already. Knew. This.
[3:41:35] <heartlesshealer> Richard was nurse-killed it seems
[3:41:38] <+GenesisKnight> @Nahual_Amini Mediocre
[3:41:40] <Talen99> Pat you look like a lovely kiwi
[3:41:41] <+Dumb_Parrot> It's the first game to render 2 worlds at the same time, isn't it? Nice for them. But it's all they have, huh?
[3:41:43] <%topendbuzza> so is this a hotel or a hospital???
[3:41:47] <+Grayhammatter> shit's locked
[3:41:55] <servicesuspension> it's a hospice??
[3:42:10] <dinnydanny777> can be your angle or your demen
[3:42:11] <%watts121> Who knows at this point.
[3:42:16] <+Snazzy_Tomato> why is there an unexplained split screen all of a sudden
[3:42:17] <Bluewolf544> @dumb_parrot didn't the master chief collection already do this
[3:42:27] <%watts121> I believe this building is whatever the story needs it to be at any given time.
[3:42:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Now you can play two shitty games
[3:42:38] <@SoFarFetched> time to play moonlight sonata
[3:42:41] <@SoFarFetched> to unlock a door
[3:42:42] <%Broand> fiiind the puzzle pieces
[3:42:45] <rytisone> play moonligth sonata
[3:42:48] <%Starotter70> OH
[3:42:49] <%Livelinne> What‚Äôs this institute anyways? Big Corp mini town?
[3:42:51] <Uselesswhitenoise> she finnaly shut up
[3:42:54] <inthenameofharman> just tuned in, what yall think of this game so far?
[3:42:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> wish granted
[3:42:56] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[3:42:57] <%MoguManda> speak up please
[3:42:57] <+Grayhammatter> oh.
[3:42:58] <servicesuspension> the splitscreen is here to tank the framerate
[3:42:58] <heartlesshealer> bye voice
[3:42:59] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> HushTheDragonSpeaks subscribed with Prime. 
[3:42:59] <TensecondTarvis> LUL
[3:43:00] <dynamic_funk> That amazing
[3:43:01] <%Broand> Hm? I didn't hear anything
[3:43:05] <Bluewolf544> two shit games rendered in the screen space of one
[3:43:06] <%whyskeywolfe> Do more, game.
[3:43:09] <%Starotter70> @inthenameofharman Mediocre
[3:43:09] <+Dumb_Parrot> @Pookiedaexzile you're right, but the split screen is not the tech, it's just showing off both worlds are constantly being rendered. It seems to be the case even when in non-split screen which is why the transitions are so fast!
[3:43:13] <servicesuspension> thank you
[3:43:16] <+doublefukiage> How we feeling about this one guys trash or hot shit?
[3:43:21] <Mattatat_tat> umbrella town, population: weird ass shit
[3:43:22] <+vaderxyz1970> just joined what's the consusus for this game?
[3:43:26] <ShineTheDiamond> This split-screen looks bad. There are so many ways to do the two-mirrored worlds bit and this is not great
[3:43:28] <+Dumb_Parrot> @Bluewolf544 maybe, didn't play it
[3:43:36] <Bluewolf544> @doublefukiage Trash shit
[3:43:37] <%BoxNavy> lotta people are just joining huh
[3:43:39] <servicesuspension> consensus is that the game is fucking boring and kinda annoying
[3:43:41] <%BoxNavy> its not very good
[3:43:42] <Uselesswhitenoise> we all hate it
[3:43:42] <%topendbuzza> hot wet shit
[3:43:43] <ShineTheDiamond> @vaderxyz1970 Not good
[3:43:51] <@SoFarFetched> da baby
[3:43:52] <+doublefukiage> @Bluewolf544 o u

[3:44:16] <ShineTheDiamond> Will we see the Elmo?
[3:44:17] <servicesuspension> dog better
[3:44:18] <Mattatat_tat> dishonored 2's split level part was really good
[3:44:20] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is she asking "What kind of cheese would I be?" again?
[3:44:22] <%BoxNavy> hes so fat
[3:44:24] <+RSNoon> I remember when the baby was elmo...
[3:44:25] <+LazyBumNetwork> -Humanity Restored-
[3:44:27] <TheAntiNihilist> @patstaresat wouldn‚Äôt you prefer to play Siren Blood Curse?
[3:44:31] <Oxybe> @patstaresat speaking of babies... do you still have Baby Ashley?
[3:44:33] <%watts121> I have a feeling it would be a cult classic if it was more than a damn point and click adventure game...where the game flat out gives you the answers.
[3:44:38] <Pookiedaexzile> Look being the word
[3:44:38] <%BoxNavy> i miss elmo jermaPluto
[3:44:40] <@SoFarFetched> There's no problem solved,you're still playing this game psaDab
[3:44:42] <fuji_92> so, the game got any better?
[3:44:43] <majindusto> YOU'RE FAT!!!
[3:44:46] <+Snazzy_Tomato> this game is only watchable in the sense that you wanna see how boring it can get
[3:44:53] <servicesuspension> OH GOD SHUT UP

[3:45:22] <Profmcstevie> Miss fucking english class over here trying to describe the feelings of random objects
[3:45:23] <%watts121> Hey those globes with the Soviet Union still on would be a collectors item.
[3:45:25] <Uselesswhitenoise> the downside o watching live is that i can't make this game go at x2.0 speed
[3:45:30] <servicesuspension> orb earths are sad, flat earths are happy
[3:45:35] <%Dakuu75> Globe Alone 3

[3:46:17] <TheAntiNihilist> This game feels like it was written as a college free writing assignment. And it got a C-
[3:46:22] <ShineTheDiamond> Why did she only shade the mane and knees?
[3:46:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no she was a horse girl
[3:46:34] <+Pilau32> So Lillianne not related to Marianne in any way?
[3:46:34] <%Starotter70> Oh no, horse girls
[3:46:37] <peachy996> Wasn't there a Vivienne too
[3:46:42] <dynamic_funk> Uncle Richard is a dirty old fuck

[3:47:00] <+GenesisKnight> A bromance broken up by booty

[3:50:09] <%BoxNavy> play a good horror game soon please
[3:50:11] <heartlesshealer> Siren seemed better, but is also not a Pat game
[3:50:11] <+thefishofwar> especially shitty invisible monsters
[3:50:15] <Zourath> I legit feel this would've been better as a book.
[3:50:18] <Profmcstevie> The gameplay is in the way of the narrative
[3:50:19] <%thepizzascotsman> Could maybe try The pc Silent Hill 2 Overhaul mod as a replacement?
[3:50:20] <Oxybe> we made le bon jeux, non?
[3:50:23] <Mirrorcatch> but it lets them say the game is three hours longer than it actually is
[3:50:25] <%Agami23> man pat, would love to see you play another horror game in place of this. like clocktower 3 or some shit.
[3:50:26] <%redthebaron> refuses to stop
[3:50:26] <TheAntiNihilist> How about you play Siren Blood Curse?
[3:50:31] <dinnydanny777> But Until Dawn
[3:50:35] <%wibbwobbler> never really a fan of insta kills lol
[3:50:37] <falsecrabmeat> The satan could also not stop talking
[3:50:42] <mortificent> Even Uncharted's zombie Nazis section was scarier than this
[3:50:43] <%Livelinne> AND NO MORE DEVILS PLEASE. ENOUGH.
[3:50:44] <+thefishofwar> game sucks
[3:50:45] <%snugglepuggs> Silent Hill more like Loud Hill
[3:50:45] <%MoguManda> Bolt Cutter
[3:50:46] <+possumwalsh1221> Sleeby boi sleep loud
[3:50:46] <%watts121> What do you mean? That Bolt Cutter spy zinger was gold!
[3:50:47] <dynamic_funk> 10 OUTTA 10
[3:50:50] <narusao> but how do i know what they're thinking unless they say it
[3:50:51] <heartlesshealer> The magical girl clocktower game? That'd be fun
[3:50:54] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Pat that's crazy I think you just hate women
[3:50:54] <%Alazull> They nailed some of the aspects of Silent Hill, but not the actual horror
[3:50:54] <%AdamElJefe> People don't want levity in a horror game
[3:50:54] <ralphfromdk> They could at least have giving her a spirit pet or something, so she wasn't just talking to herself.
[3:50:56] <psimon_> 5head
[3:50:57] <%SirGO0SE> <3
[3:50:59] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> Your playable character needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine.
[3:51:00] <%Arancet> then its a qte without prompts
[3:51:01] <Profmcstevie> Can't even be wrong
[3:51:02] <+mortalmanbaby> i was hoping the medium was going to be like evil within
[3:51:03] <+Pilau32> The demon's just an incel too
[3:51:03] <pennykettle_> @SirGO0SE Quote of the week unironically
[3:51:08] <@SoFarFetched> Pat my huge problem with this is they call it a "third-person psychological horror game" but you calling it a Narrative game means they completely missed the mark on making it a horror game.
[3:51:08] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh no stream over?
[3:51:09] <%redthebaron> if the main character is solving the puzzles WHY EVEN PUT IT IN
[3:51:10] <Uselesswhitenoise> some how make little nightmares 2 come out early and play that right now instyead
[3:51:11] <%baka_sugoi> -10/10 couldn't pet cat
[3:51:16] <%TheGreatSunbro> Also there's no real suspense in if you're going the right way or not while following magical breadcrumbs
[3:51:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> Is it good?
[3:51:26] <%watts121> Every puzzle is go back to the cold/hot area to change the keycard.
[3:51:28] <servicesuspension> 10/10 it was a huge waste of time
[3:51:30] <Bluewolf544> That's a great analogy
[3:51:30] <+TomDanksEGOT> while reading scraps of paper
[3:51:32] <Meekest> @PatStaresAt Would you rather this or Amnesia Rebirth
[3:51:32] <pennykettle_> Straight hallway with the key in front of the door, but you can't see the key until you try opening the door
[3:51:34] <Samurai_Jake> so medium bad?
[3:51:40] <+holyxgrale> Oh look this ripped piece of paper two steps from this notebook
[3:51:44] <+possumwalsh1221> Yamaoaka deserves better Sadge
[3:51:45] <%Master_Van> Just time lengthening locks
[3:51:56] <+VoidN0> it's the ilusion of a puzzle
[3:51:58] <%JamesCorck> This game is way up its own ass.
[3:52:00] <Arek_1> It went like "Is it a puzzle if your only choices are solutions?"
[3:52:00] <%watts121> wait wtf...RE8 is $80?
[3:52:02] <heartlesshealer> LB is not a good "holding" button
[3:52:05] <%ssjklyco> it has medium application
[3:52:05] <+nirvana227> LUL
[3:52:10] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Are you buying the soundtrack tho?
[3:52:11] <fuji_92> save it for the podcast
[3:52:12] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So, babby writer's first video game?
[3:52:13] <+gimmickypizza> another DOA added to the game pass pile
[3:52:15] <%JamesCorck> Hey Pat you should also label this as a review of the game.
[3:52:18] <%Starotter70> What is this? A maze for Paige? sipsipSipsipblind
[3:52:18] <dynamic_funk> Timmy first Horror game
[3:52:18] <rytisone> danger, watch yourself
[3:52:18] <narusao> <- DANGER
[3:52:19] <pennykettle_> a mobile game 2d arrow
[3:52:19] <servicesuspension> The Feel of a Puzzle
[3:52:21] <Uselesswhitenoise> oh, it's just a worse killer 7
[3:52:21] <rjhascancer> @watts121 for ps5 yes
[3:52:21] <+ZoltanBMagnus> Is this the "The Order 1886" of this generation?
[3:52:23] <+thefishofwar> chat got the better experience cause we didn't have to play it
[3:52:27] <dinnydanny777> Like the Cursor in FF7 or something? LUL
[3:52:31] <%KeiganOfAstora> <--- Danger
[3:52:32] <%BoxNavy> it looks so cheap
[3:52:32] <+MugenSandan> I feel like this games proves that the Layers of Fear devs got super lucky with that game becoming popular with YouTubers and Streamers
[3:52:34] <@SoFarFetched> no everyone in chat was having issues pat,it wasnt just you
[3:52:35] <%KeiganOfAstora> ?
[3:52:35] <Profmcstevie> No be hard on it, games have solved this shit for years
[3:52:36] <ZComiX> workshopping for the podcast are we
[3:52:38] <+ServiusWolf> these devs are so good at making almost good games
[3:52:39] <+Dumb_Parrot> that arrow just clashes with the style of the game 100%
[3:52:41] <%KeiganOfAstora> Hey what's your shirt say?
[3:52:46] <Flyatmebro> not too hard that was bad
[3:52:47] <%watts121> @ZoltanBMagnus would need a budget to be that.
[3:52:48] <@SoFarFetched> LakeView Hotel
[3:52:50] <@SoFarFetched> is what the shirt says
[3:52:51] <+GenesisKnight> The arrow feels like they tossed it in once they realized how badly designed the encounter was
[3:52:56] <%TheGreatSunbro> You walk into the police station's hall in RE2 and there's a giant arrow over Mr.X's head pointing down at him across the room
[3:52:58] <%Bree_Bear> nah, that's lazy
[3:53:00] <+possumwalsh1221> Lakeview widepeepoHappy
[3:53:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> Shame
[3:53:07] <+ZoltanBMagnus> @watts121 fair enough
[3:53:10] <%Agami23> man that hotel is kinda confusing.
[3:53:16] <42nfl19> I missed it but was it invisible in both? Or could it been seen in the other dimension?
[3:53:19] <+possumwalsh1221> Oh god it did seem like that oof
[3:53:20] <peachy996> member SH2? what a good game
[3:53:23] <Meekest> It feels like the protagonist monologues are also added on in post
[3:53:34] <harryjpeter> I've just got here after playing The Medium, what arrow? I didn't see any arrow pointing at the monster during my playthrough
[3:53:34] <ZComiX> the game just doesn't feel confident in yourself
[3:53:36] <fuji_92> if he hears u he goes after u too
[3:53:38] <%sniffy77> oh hey 343 released some more halo infinite news
[3:53:41] <rjhascancer> bad game is bad
[3:53:44] <%QueequegTheater> This feels like somebody needed to hire multiple editors like three years ago
[3:53:46] <+thefishofwar> I wish you could just ghost blast the ghost monster
[3:53:47] <heartlesshealer> sounds like shit controls
[3:53:48] <%DappercatEsquire> guess i missed the game, did pat not like it?
[3:53:49] <%BoxNavy> alright moon2W
[3:53:50] <+possumwalsh1221> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear‚Äù the game
[3:53:54] <mortificent> like, Hardcore Nemesis and the Hunters in RE3 Remake were scarier than this and that was an action game
[3:53:56] <leinadtonu> Pat reviews at...
[3:53:56] <fuji_92> mediocre game is mediocre more like
[3:54:00] <cherrycottontail> well, they got the style good
[3:54:00] <ComfyFox> crouching and holding breath? sounds like death stranding
[3:54:00] <peachy996> THanks for giving Akira yamaoka work though
[3:54:02] <servicesuspension> it would all have been better if Discount Jessie from Control could have shut up
[3:54:04] <heartlesshealer> @DappercatEsquire Oh boy
[3:54:08] <%JamesCorck> what is worse? This game or the comic sans on Silent hill 2 remastered?
[3:54:09] <%The_Protagonist> HOW THE HELL DOES THIS GAME HAVE PERFECT SCORES ON SOME PUBLICATIONS
[3:54:16] <peachy996> I look forward to listening to the whole soundtrack
[3:54:17] <BlkFlameKami> D:
[3:54:19] <%Puhff> Puhff subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! Fuck yeah, it's January and my birthday! Normally I'd make a funny but between getting into a car wreck last week and and finding out I owe $1800 in taxes today, I'll just suggest you check out the new Dwarven Engineer DLC class for Vermintide 2!
[3:54:22] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Yamaoka got paid tho
[3:54:27] <%FacetiousAF> FacetiousAF subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! money gave money for animal foods
[3:54:27] <+possumwalsh1221> They paid them ez
[3:54:30] <+gimmickypizza> money
[3:54:30] <%BoxNavy> horror is dead moon2W
[3:54:33] <heartlesshealer> Purely Graphics
[3:54:33] <+GenesisKnight> @The_Protagonist Some reviewers only care about presentation
[3:54:38] <dinnydanny777> Horror game fans starved of content LUL
[3:54:41] <majindusto> You've never seen a lot of good shit
[3:54:42] <+cvp5127> its easy LUL
[3:54:43] <%echobee_tv> January game for sure
[3:54:43] <Meekest> You loved plenty of those walking simulators
[3:54:44] <%SirGO0SE> there are good ones
[3:54:44] <servicesuspension> the only horror nowadays is life
[3:54:46] <T_Sasquatch> I DO
[3:54:47] <harryjpeter> cos the game is pretty good imo
[3:54:52] <%TwoStarPlayersNik> Remember the Vice review of RE2 Remake who lamented the fact that it wasn't a walking simulator? That's why.
[3:54:53] <Oxybe> @patstaresat Briefcases full of dollars. That's how Pat.
[3:54:55] <rytisone> Gone Home is pretty cool too
[3:54:57] <%The_Protagonist> yeah Dear Ester is pretty neat
[3:55:00] <+Dumb_Parrot> Perfect scores given like it's from Famitsu I guess
[3:55:01] <%boxboten> what remains of edith finch was great
[3:55:01] <mortificent> Dear Esther is pretty goof
[3:55:02] <Profmcstevie> I am that kinda person, make your fucking game good regardless
[3:55:02] <T_Sasquatch> Edith finch is really good tho
[3:55:03] <pennykettle_> The Stanley Parable is a walking sim and one of the best games ever made
[3:55:03] <ralphfromdk> But this walking simulator makes you play parts again and again if you "die"
[3:55:05] <mortificent> good
[3:55:06] <%BoxNavy> no this shithouse studio in poland didnt pay off reviewers chat
[3:55:08] <%Agami23> like a visual novel almost
[3:55:13] <+GenesisKnight> If there's no fail state it's not a game
[3:55:15] <Arek_1> I'm so sad. Are there any games from my home country that are good? Besides The Witcher 3 on a good day?
[3:55:18] <+possumwalsh1221> Yeah dear Esther was more of an experience than a game
[3:55:19] <%baka_sugoi> bad game is bad
[3:55:21] <%whyskeywolfe> What was there TO like about Dear Esther? It was so boring and pretentious.
[3:55:21] <peachy996> You even liked some of the walkies from the shitstorms
[3:55:24] <%Livelinne> psaUp psaUp psaUp
[3:55:24] <DartAran> I went to look at some of those reviews, saw someone say it was the best third person horror game they've ever played, and I just
[3:55:27] <+ServiusWolf> life is strange is good
[3:55:28] <%Deft_Thought> Get em Pat
[3:55:29] <TensecondTarvis> or a story
[3:55:29] <Midnight188> I bet dumfuck normies will eat this up
[3:55:30] <%Deft_Thought> Light em up
[3:55:31] <%Livelinne> Nice attitude
[3:55:38] <+Snazzy_Tomato> this should have just been a book
[3:55:40] <+NiktenKing> Dear Esther didnt lie to you about its contents
[3:55:40] <%redthebaron> i feel like the game thinks i am dumb as a player
[3:55:41] <servicesuspension> eurojank can be fun, this was just euroboring
[3:55:50] <Profmcstevie> The Stanley Parable is a "walking simulator" that is stronger being a game, it's great to interact within
[3:55:54] <servicesuspension> dumfuck normies WILL eat this up
[3:55:55] <%topendbuzza> how do I shot em
[3:55:57] <%wibbwobbler> some cool puzzles might have saved it i guess
[3:55:57] <+gimmickypizza> uncharted has plot
[3:55:58] <%weissguard> Do you try to stealth at first if at all?>
[3:56:01] <%BoxNavy> huh thats a good contextualization
[3:56:01] <peachy996> I would rather play The Last Dead End
[3:56:02] <mortificent> yeyeye you can go cover to cover or run and gun
[3:56:03] <%Alazull> That game could've been an animated movie
[3:56:05] <KaitlynnHere> What a disappointment, you even got all dressed up for this game and everything @patstaresat
[3:56:06] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> The choice is the gameplay not the story
[3:56:15] <%Alazull> Whereas Uncharted actually has gameplay
[3:56:21] <Uselesswhitenoise> you should finish Pathologic 2 lol
[3:56:21] <%Starotter70> Horror Climbing
[3:56:23] <+DragonArt07> they should have made a comic rather then a game
[3:56:24] <ToneBacas> the two worlds mechanic and story would be the only things that could carry this game, but i guess they're not interesting either
[3:56:25] <servicesuspension> this one could have been ok as a comic, but nothing else
[3:56:28] <%Deft_Thought> @PatStaresAt Legit question then, although I don't know if you touched it: How do you feel about games like A Plague's Tale: Innocence?
[3:56:43] <%boxboten> pathologic is a stress sim there's no way pat could finish it
[3:56:46] <penitentpendant> To no one's surprise, there's one ending
[3:56:49] <servicesuspension> As much as I shit on Jessie from Control, at least that game had HYPE
[3:56:55] <%SomeSageAdvice> @Deft_Thought he has a playthrough of it on youtube
[3:56:56] <Uselesswhitenoise> IT WOULDN'T EVEN LET YOU FIGURE OUT THE PUZZELS
[3:56:57] <%Starotter70> I think he streamed it when it came out @Deft_Thought
[3:56:59] <+waltzqueen> better or worse than beyond two souls?
[3:56:59] <%BoxNavy> @Deft_Thought oh pat like plague tale
[3:57:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> @Deft_Thought he loved it
[3:57:02] <dinnydanny777> @deft_thought A Plague's Tale has gameplay though
[3:57:02] <Uselesswhitenoise> it just told you how to do them
[3:57:03] <+takutoots> LUL
[3:57:03] <jorniev> oh i just got here
[3:57:04] <%Spydurman> @PatStaresAt this wants to be a Netflix Original
[3:57:05] <TheAntiNihilist> What game will replace this?
[3:57:06] <+possumwalsh1221> It has the illusion of choice but relies to heavily on said illusions
[3:57:07] <+IHATREID> pat bald
[3:57:07] <jorniev> ohw was it?
[3:57:10] <%Deft_Thought> Oh he did? I missed that
[3:57:11] <nevan_44> LUL
[3:57:14] <%TrafficCohen> What game is he talking about
[3:57:19] <Maxicqwe> this is so depressing for the devs
[3:57:22] <%whyskeywolfe> The fact that this was 50% of the game is a joke.
[3:57:31] <Dannzzyy> Another hit Xbox game release. :)
[3:57:36] <VeryTricky> !uptime
[3:57:36] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 57m.
[3:57:37] <Psyramics> pat getting madder the more he thinks about this
[3:57:38] <+Dumb_Parrot> journalists love extreme hand-holding too :3
[3:57:40] <%topendbuzza> it does
[3:57:42] <peachy996> Yeah but its way more interesting
[3:57:44] <$8BitDsx> The stealth is similar to the Sherry segment in REmake 2.
[3:57:45] <jorniev> DOWNPOUR TOO
[3:57:51] <%Starotter70> But it's good
[3:57:53] <peachy996> And its there once
[3:57:59] <%Deft_Thought> @dinnydanny777 Oh for sure. I don't think the two are similar but I did find that A Plague's Tale frayed a bit once you realized there was the way to resolve the environmental puzzles
[3:58:01] <%Alazull> Yeah, the hospital
[3:58:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> That was HALF the game!
[3:58:04] <%redthebaron> the jogging arround
[3:58:05] <sweet_gravy> downcoming is shit and a bad example
[3:58:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> Waht?
[3:58:10] <rytisone> and that game has a dog ending
[3:58:11] <+possumwalsh1221> Yeah true even downpour did it better and that was a train wreck
[3:58:12] <penitentpendant> You RUN in that game, you power walk in this one
[3:58:13] <jorniev> REMEMBER THE RED BALL IN DOWNPOUR?
[3:58:14] <servicesuspension> 76 metascore??? fucking waht?
[3:58:20] <+NiktenKing> Mystery of Castle Super Beast was exponentially better
[3:58:20] <%wibbwobbler> like a video game
[3:58:21] <%Deft_Thought> You make choices dealing with other people in the periphery though
[3:58:28] <dinnydanny777> @deft_thought I suppose
[3:58:34] <%QueequegTheater> OOF
[3:58:36] <%Starotter70> And you don't even know your Crash Bandicooting for half of it
[3:58:36] <%Alazull> @PatStaresAt That could've been an hour and a half long animated movie, but as a game it seems like not interesting enough to put in the time.
[3:58:39] <+possumwalsh1221> OH GOD IT WAS THE HELLBOY ANGEL SHUT UP
[3:58:41] <mortificent> yeah, and in RE2 and 3 you beat the shit out of the persuer
[3:58:50] <peachy996> with paper wings
[3:58:53] <ABootlegPerson> so clap -$50?
[3:58:55] <+carfar_farcar> lighting is cool
[3:58:57] <+GenesisKnight> God. It really is
[3:59:01] <servicesuspension> just give the main character a gun
[3:59:02] <peachy996> bam bam bam all the beats are there
[3:59:08] <penitentpendant> Kind of reminded me of Pan's Labrynth
[3:59:08] <mortificent> OH GOD
[3:59:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn
[3:59:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> And it want's to wear your skin or some shit and won't shut up about it
[3:59:11] <aluddss> oh
[3:59:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Why he hit em like that
[3:59:20] <jorniev> Are you going to play Olija?
[3:59:21] <$Afterman_> i love raziel
[3:59:22] <+Conker139> hey pat how would i share a youtube channel with you that i think you would enjoy without plugging someone elses shit
[3:59:27] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:59:27] <peachy996> It was super horny for yo
[3:59:27] <%Flamefish345> Flamefish345 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hey Pat I've been late to sharing my 10 month sub anniversary. Sounds like i'll try The Medium for myself, but since it doesn't sound like you're enjoying it, are you gonna replace the game with something else? Could I recommend Olija?
[3:59:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Stealing from Del Toro
[3:59:32] <%Agami23> man i saw some legacy of cain recently, that game was rad
[3:59:32] <+NiktenKing> Glad this is on gamepass cause yikes
[3:59:37] <DublinRage> an example of "Mash-up Gone Wrong"
[3:59:41] <+possumwalsh1221> Is that gief snoring in the background omg
[3:59:44] <peachy996> It never shuts up about how horny it is
[3:59:44] <Giztech> should have had the child skull
[3:59:48] <TheAntiNihilist> Play Soul Reaver Pat!
[3:59:51] <+GenesisKnight> Smashing Marianne!
[3:59:51] <%king_wragles> Her director sucks
[3:59:51] <+DoktorZee> the monster feels like directly inspired after someone went to Del Torros exhibit
[4:00:02] <%king_wragles> and the character isn't great
[4:00:06] <dinnydanny777> Is she like an exposition character
[4:00:07] <%BoxNavy> i think sadness' actor was doing a good job
[4:00:07] <$Afterman_> YES

[4:00:26] <+NiktenKing> YEYEYE
[4:00:28] <%JamesCorck> Yes but it was interesting.
[4:00:29] <+possumwalsh1221> YUUUUPPP
[4:00:29] <Profmcstevie> AND THOSE ARE SOME OLD GAMES
[4:00:31] <Laecerelius> Yeah Sadness had a good voice actress
[4:00:33] <%JamesCorck> It was so interesting,
[4:00:34] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt Is this better than nothing tho? Are we getting another SH anytime soon?
[4:00:34] <jorniev> ITS SO SHAKESPEREAN
[4:00:35] <%king_wragles> I'm scarred that I agree
[4:00:35] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Its great
[4:00:37] <mortificent> I LOVE THAT SHIT
[4:00:39] <ZComiX> I think if she delivered the dialogue with a bit more panicit would sound like she was trying to comfort herself
[4:00:39] <ComfyFox> lets play that
[4:00:47] <heartlesshealer> gotta hear that
[4:00:50] <%JamesCorck> It was character, and lore, and world building, and it was awesome.
[4:00:52] <jorniev> VAE VICTIS
[4:00:54] <+MugenSandan> I would pay to hear Raziel order at McDonalds
[4:00:58] <+possumwalsh1221> Yeah play that instead LUL
[4:00:59] <ralphfromdk> PatStaresAt How did you like the Alan Wake games? I feel they did narration the "right" way.
[4:01:00] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> DUDE. Legacy of Kain is one of my FAVORITES. There was supposed to be so much more.
[4:01:02] <%redthebaron> the bolt cutter whole deal is insane
[4:01:06] <mortificent> They are so petty bitches, I LOVE IT
[4:01:19] <jorniev> THATS A PULL
[4:01:30] <%Dakuu75> I fucking love that line
[4:01:30] <%Deft_Thought> That's a good line
[4:01:34] <%Master_Van> This was like bad York monologues
[4:01:38] <+takutoots> @jorniev indeed
[4:01:39] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> I've played the whole series and Pat is right. You CANNOT. GET. ENOUGH. They writing is so beautiful, the plot is gorgeous
[4:01:41] <KaiserMario> Wait... Did you say "Michael Bay" was in it?
[4:01:41] <MidnightPacif1c> are you gonna bark all day little doggy
[4:01:44] <+GenesisKnight> "It's almost like a writer wroter it." LUL
[4:01:45] <Profmcstevie> It's too smart for the moment
[4:01:49] <pennykettle_> You cant have a man named Michael Madson and a man named Mads Mikkelson exist in the same universe
[4:01:51] <%Starotter70> I feel like there was so much talking, I could never have a moment to process
[4:01:55] <%BoxNavy> thats strong
[4:01:55] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> Michael Bay is in it!
[4:01:56] <SpaceGuntank> thats called Charisma
[4:01:58] <ToneBacas> yeah sounds like something a real person would not say as a quick response
[4:01:59] <Meekest> I'd take overwritten before mindless drivel
[4:02:02] <tacoisgoods> I had hope for this game but it seems like a meh walking simulator with a boring monster.
[4:02:12] <jorniev> inane dialogue?
[4:02:17] <Decarcassor> Its not even dialogue, just inner monologue
[4:02:20] <KaiserMario> @HushTheDragonSpeaks From Transformers?
[4:02:22] <dinnydanny777> More meaningless dialogue than meaningful dialogue
[4:02:25] <cherrycottontail> it's rambly
[4:02:27] <jorniev> LIKE SONIC BOOM?
[4:02:28] <mortificent> Charisma can sell overwritten dialogue
[4:02:28] <aluddss> a lot of nothing being said
[4:02:28] <cherrycottontail> first-draft-ish
[4:02:30] <fuji_92> underwritten with a ton of dialogue about useless stuff
[4:02:31] <+possumwalsh1221> It‚Äôs just a lot of words with no substance, like trying to hit an essay word count
[4:02:32] <%redthebaron> it is insane
[4:02:33] <filialpails> the writing is spread too thin
[4:02:34] <rytisone> Cutters, Bolt Cutters
[4:02:36] <%BoxNavy> that bolt cutter shit was the worst thing in a while
[4:02:39] <peachy996> Agent Bolt Cutters is a line from ME3 DLC
[4:02:39] <BlkFlameKami> the cringe hit me the right way, won't lie
[4:02:41] <%baka_sugoi> TRASH
[4:02:42] <%redthebaron> i am so pissed at the agent cutters bit
[4:02:44] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> Oh! Sorry, Michael Bell
[4:02:47] <Visorak6> The bolt cutter joke only works if the character is endearing or has someone to play off of imo
[4:02:48] <+Jaysky> You didn't like her joke?
[4:02:49] <Profmcstevie> It's straight up "next bit" territory
[4:02:50] <jorniev> SO LIKE SONIC BOOM
[4:02:52] <Srthunda> you thought it would end then it didnt, then you thought it would end but it still didn't
[4:02:53] <penitentpendant> Cutters, cutters, got to get the Cutters.
[4:02:56] <dinnydanny777> You can write this shit but you can't say it
[4:02:56] <+WutangchickeN> I think the dialogue is used better in the village demo wutang6AHAHA wutang6AHAHA wutang6AHAHA
[4:03:01] <CozyRunner> the payer
[4:03:02] <fuji_92> cutters, gotta get the cutters, cutters, gotta get the cutters
[4:03:06] <peachy996> Agent Bolt Cutters is a jokey line Straight out of the Citadel DLC from Mass Effect 3
[4:03:09] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> @KaiserMario Sorry, new to Twitch. I meant Michael Bell
[4:03:12] <Midnight188> could've done so much more with so much less
[4:03:12] <servicesuspension> if you need dialogue so your player don't get bored, you lost already
[4:03:27] <penitentpendant> I don't qualify this as horror
[4:03:27] <Meekest> RE3?
[4:03:30] <+allups> so that game wasnt good
[4:03:30] <KaiserMario> @HushTheDragonSpeaks Oh, thanks, I was very confused
[4:03:31] <+Grayhammatter> balloon, gotta get the balloon
[4:03:32] <dinnydanny777> Until Dawn maybe?
[4:03:32] <silverira> what if she said call me Master of Unlocking @PatStaresAt
[4:03:35] <jorniev> BEST PART OF SILENT HILL WAS THE SILENCE
[4:03:36] <%SirGO0SE> its really good
[4:03:38] <+possumwalsh1221> The horror was letting the player play the game
[4:03:39] <%wibbwobbler> SeemsGood
[4:03:39] <sweet_gravy> RE3R
[4:03:46] <Profmcstevie> You know who WOULD say that line? AGENT YORK
[4:03:50] <%SirGO0SE> this shows you the value of a good Director
[4:03:55] <%shiplord13> @PatStaresAt It really feels like they had two different ideas on what kind of game they were making and ended up just forcing two concepts together that don't fit
[4:03:56] <%baka_sugoi> Good setting bad gameplay
[4:03:57] <orphan_ash> is this really horror though?
[4:03:59] <%HushTheDragonSpeaks> @KaiserMario My bad, I got sooo excited about this series, no one knows what it is.
[4:03:59] <penitentpendant> It's justified
[4:03:59] <Sulliman34> im late but uh....i assume the game is bad
[4:04:00] <TensecondTarvis> its super linear too
[4:04:02] <+DoktorZee> nah Until Dawn still had charm to it
[4:04:04] <servicesuspension> No, complaining is awesome!
[4:04:07] <+NiktenKing> Style w/o substance
[4:04:08] <+Jaysky> Nope, you're fine
[4:04:08] <+Dumb_Parrot> But they don't let us get actually get immersed imo
[4:04:08] <mortificent> nah RE3R benefited cause it was action shlock, as it should be
[4:04:09] <+possumwalsh1221> Nah you have valid salt right now LUL
[4:04:09] <@SoFarFetched> no you had good reasons
[4:04:10] <%Starotter70> Nah, I agree
[4:04:10] <+rocko_125> wow this game must really sucked
[4:04:10] <%Alazull> Nah dude, I like hearing an actual opinion
[4:04:11] <%crimsonharvest> Games need to let you Disco Elysium it more often and just take the hands off the player
[4:04:11] <%Deft_Thought> It's a bummer to have high expectations and feel like the game just doesn't deliver at all
[4:04:12] <%SirGO0SE> no, its good criticism and articulated
[4:04:13] <+DoktorZee> Man of Medan on the other hand was garbage
[4:04:15] <%Taisuru> Nah, you're complaining cause you like these kinds of games and this is a bad one
[4:04:16] <penitentpendant> I look forward to this section on next Podcast
[4:04:16] <%Sotetsu> I'm enjoying your thoughts.
[4:04:16] <aluddss> no no, u rite
[4:04:17] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt sooo...10/10?
[4:04:18] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I feels to me, you're anfrier because you're disappointed
[4:04:20] <i_am_therydon> your rant is more interesting than the game
[4:04:20] <%redthebaron> that is just fair it was like watching a bad horror movie
[4:04:20] <rytisone> so more on friday, yeah?
[4:04:20] <peachy996> nah these are valid complaints
[4:04:20] <iosephe> Nah, you're right
[4:04:20] <+RogueEwok> love hearing you complain, i think it's your biggest strength
[4:04:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wow that Halo Infinite thing is a BIG fuckin post
[4:04:21] <%Romuken> @PatStaresAt 76 is done better
[4:04:24] <+imtheoldmanjenks> The complaining only makes you stronger
[4:04:27] <%Master_Van> Nah let it out
[4:04:27] <Profmcstevie> Something that misses this much is kinda embarrassing, like dude look at any other game
[4:04:28] <%BoxNavy> until dawn is supposed to be a horror movie thriller not a psychoigcal horror
[4:04:29] <%Alazull> Versus just saying it's bad
[4:04:30] <peachy996> Oh yeah fuck Man of Medan
[4:04:31] <ralphfromdk> Speaking of weird Russian game worlds... I'm still looking foward to that Atomic Heart game...
[4:04:32] <fuji_92> you are, but we can see where it comes from, it comes from wasted potential @patstaresat
[4:04:33] <+carfar_farcar> good thing I have game pass and didn't pay for the game
[4:04:33] <%Sotetsu> I think Until Dawn was my favorite horror game of the past few years.
[4:04:35] <Laecerelius> For a game that's inspired by Silent Hill they didn't seem to learn anything from how it does its horror.
[4:04:35] <jorniev> I GET IT if you come out trying to emulate SILENT FUKING HILL you better NOT MISS
[4:04:36] <+Jaysky> If people are giving this 9/10 feel free to shit talk it
[4:04:36] <%Arancet> theres some really good sticking out from a massive sea of dull
[4:04:37] <KaitlynnHere> Oh I thought you were talking about the walking dead again when Kenny thought lee knew how to pick locks for.... reasons @patstaresat
[4:04:38] <%baka_sugoi> isn't it like $60
[4:04:38] <+takutoots> nah this is fair they set up the comparison as a marketing point
[4:04:41] <%Bree_Bear> lol you're allowed to not enjoy it
[4:04:44] <dinnydanny777> To be fair most horror games are awful
[4:04:45] <+possumwalsh1221> KHOLAT FOR EXAMPLE
[4:04:45] <MrBaldachin> you played visage not too long ago and that was way better
[4:04:46] <TheAntiNihilist> Sap
[4:04:47] <%Mr_Pylon> Fuckin Carrier did more with fixed camera angles
[4:04:50] <%JamesCorck> I was thinking, this game doesn't even hold up to the standard of the shitstorm.
[4:04:50] <TheAntiNihilist> Scp
[4:04:51] <redmoon108> PowerUpL 2020Rivalry PowerUpR I hope your feeling better
[4:04:52] <PeteyMcPickle> Did pat already play the medium and hate it?
[4:04:54] <bleugh> it feels like it doesn't really know what it wants to be
[4:04:57] <penitentpendant> It's a movie someone tried to pass off as a game
[4:04:58] <astrophizz> I think it's a mismatch of expectations
[4:04:58] <+NiktenKing> Remerai's game was better
[4:05:00] <@SoFarFetched> yeah petey
[4:05:02] <%Agami23> this makes me really bummed out because i like watching you play horror games. but this is dull
[4:05:02] <%Broand> Wasn't there another game where there was too much talking in a similar fashion recently?
[4:05:08] <Giztech> I like it you remind me of the ranting Swed in sheep in the big city
[4:05:11] <%BoxNavy> yeah i know
[4:05:11] <jorniev> too bad i missed the stream
[4:05:18] <PeteyMcPickle> Damn
[4:05:22] <TensecondTarvis> Its a narrative game that had troubles telling the narrative, little to connect it all
[4:05:24] <PeteyMcPickle> Yeah me too jorniev
[4:05:24] <aluddss> Remerai's castle super beast game actually better LUL
[4:05:28] <%Sotetsu> @sofarfetched I had to step away for a bit, did he beat it? fmgS
[4:05:34] <%ssjklyco> Canada Stonks are just Maple Syrup bottles
[4:05:44] <peachy996> Yamaoka
[4:05:46] <rei0> akira toriyama
[4:05:46] <+Dumb_Parrot> LUL
[4:05:48] <%Taisuru> AKIRA TORIYAMA LUL
[4:05:48] <+possumwalsh1221> TORIYAMA LUL
[4:05:48] <+Deko_> toriyama LUL
[4:05:48] <mortificent> LUL LUL
[4:05:48] <peachy996> Jeez dude lol
[4:05:49] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[4:05:51] <Meekest> Nothing
[4:05:52] <%Deft_Thought> Dr. Slump made the music!!!
[4:05:53] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[4:05:53] <+GenesisKnight> Akira Toriyama LUL
[4:05:54] <servicesuspension> Akira Yamaoka wasted!
[4:05:56] <fuji_92> LUL TORIYAMA
[4:05:58] <+sonicitus> LUL
[4:05:59] <+DoktorZee> didnt even hear the music
[4:06:02] <%Sotetsu> Akira Torioka
[4:06:03] <%BoxNavy> i did not notice any of the music
[4:06:03] <+gimmickypizza> It would sound like trunks
[4:06:04] <CozyRunner> Toriyama OST PogChamp
[4:06:04] <Laecerelius> That's the kind of dumb brain fart I'd make
[4:06:05] <djblue_shift> LUL LUL
[4:06:06] <+Grayhammatter> yo, ka ka ka kachi daze
[4:06:06] <%shiplord13> The Dragon Ball writer and artist was our music guy.
[4:06:09] <+eanscrale> Damn no wonder he don't write so good, workin too hard on tht music career
[4:06:14] <+Malacious> LUL
[4:06:14] <peachy996> Why?
[4:06:15] <fuji_92> the ost is great, but seem like that's about it
[4:06:15] <+possumwalsh1221> Yeah Yamaoka nails it 100% of the time but when that‚Äôs the ONLY good part
[4:06:15] <tacoisgoods> Yamaoka was wasted on this.
[4:06:19] <+gimmickypizza> barely heard the music in this game
[4:06:21] <majindusto> We are NEVER getting a New Silent Hill Game! :(
[4:06:23] <%Broand> Oh now I remember what it reminds me of. the new amnesia game
[4:06:24] <%Taisuru> Pat just has DBFZ on the mind today
[4:06:35] <%Starotter70> Then just ambiance
[4:06:35] <%crimsonharvest> I bet Toriyama would write a jazz fusion stage epic if music was his deal
[4:06:38] <+GenesisKnight> Budget went to the music?
[4:06:39] <%shiplord13> Silent Hill as a franchise seems to have been forsaken
[4:06:42] <peachy996> Stuff has to happen for there to be new music
[4:06:43] <%Ranryu692> he was expensive, obviously
[4:06:44] <+carfar_farcar> 50/50 score, half was yama the other half was a bloober team composer
[4:06:47] <fuji_92> silent hill is dead and konami killed it
[4:06:48] <Giztech> it's all they could afford lol
[4:06:50] <Profmcstevie> If the monster had a really good theme that you dreaded by a single note, ooh baby
[4:06:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> All I remember hearing was the danger monster noise
[4:06:54] <sweet_gravy> @Broand Yeah man the new amnesia was fucking awful :(
[4:06:55] <+DoktorZee> you can even enjoy the monster music because the monster doesnt shut up
[4:07:03] <%Taisuru> They're also on Game Pass!
[4:07:04] <%BoxNavy> isnt 6 on pc? monkaS
[4:07:04] <+Dumb_Parrot> I miss SH1's ambiance, very harsh and annoying for some, but it was truly special for me
[4:07:07] <%echobee_tv> 6 is coming in May
[4:07:07] <+EasyAsDan> If you have to think about the music then it wasnt memorable
[4:07:10] <Sulliman34> 5 is so fucking good outside of THAT ONE PART
[4:07:12] <%Romuken> Think you'd play Lobotomy Corp?
[4:07:12] <%shiplord13> Hey why don't you play Yakuza 3
[4:07:13] <+WizoSavage> 5 better than 0?
[4:07:14] <mortificent> yeyeye 5 IS REALLY GOOD
[4:07:15] <%Ranryu692> you like 5 more than 6?
[4:07:15] <thetruenicster> Really? 5?
[4:07:17] <Reaver_Parable> Jacuzzis 6 was announced for February I believe
[4:07:20] <dinnydanny777> Was there a single good horror game this year?
[4:07:21] <ElusiveStarlord> @PatStaresAt yakuza 6 is in march!
[4:07:22] <Reaver_Parable> yakuza*
[4:07:23] <%Ranryu692> *5 more than 4
[4:07:25] <%imtheoldmanjenks> imtheoldmanjenks subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:07:26] <%DedlokPM> They literally announced Yakuza 6 for both gamepass and PC months ago
[4:07:27] <%AyotoCorp> Yakuza 6 is on PC in March
[4:07:30] <peachy996> @Profmcstevie If I was Yamaoka I wouldn't work too hard to make a track for that guy
[4:07:33] <Sulliman34> @WizoSavage yes! 0 is great but doesnt hold up to some of the other titles
[4:07:38] <%Trenr> oh no is this the end
[4:07:40] <astrophizz> 6 is in March
[4:07:40] <+Dumb_Parrot> Guys don't remind Pat of Y6 LUL
[4:07:47] <+takutoots> LUL
[4:07:48] <+WizoSavage> interesting, can't wait
[4:07:54] <@SoFarFetched> we're getting old
[4:07:55] <Sulliman34> Y6 was good the twist was just really weak
[4:07:56] <%s_xylocalsingles> no they dont

[4:08:43] <%imtheoldmanjenks> Didnt we get that CSB game? That was fun
[4:08:55] <servicesuspension> this is just a reminder that making games ain't easy
[4:08:56] <+Dumb_Parrot> Has Pat finished Pathologic?
[4:09:03] <+nicoleymcquack> I trust your survival horror opinions over anyone elses
[4:09:08] <xanerts> Just tuned in. So... not good?

[4:09:59] <jorniev> SORRY MAN
[4:10:00] <%Valdorick> Mood = downed
[4:10:01] <mr_saturday93> rip your dentist
[4:10:01] <+WizoSavage> Yeah he does need a new dentist
[4:10:01] <Pookiedaexzile> Shoulda Been a ObGyn

[4:10:09] <%imtheoldmanjenks> psaUp psaUp
[4:10:10] <+possumwalsh1221> That‚Äôs a Florida man article if I‚Äôve ever heard it
[4:10:16] <%FingaLights> What??
[4:10:16] <%baka_sugoi> not tooth doctor
[4:10:17] <peachy996> I think Layers of Fear 1 was alright
[4:10:20] <%Agami23> but observer wasent very scary.
[4:10:23] <Waldo_landfill> wait, he killed someone then got let out on good behavior?
[4:10:24] <Pookiedaexzile> But the Dog died
[4:10:26] <redmoon108> Real shit üôè
[4:10:27] <%Agami23> it was super cool. but not scary
[4:10:28] <@SoFarFetched> yeah its weird to say "not to bring down the mood" and give us something like that.
[4:10:34] <+takutoots> wait is Bugsnax a better horror game than Medium LUL
[4:10:34] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt On Yamaoka's Spotify the "The Medium" OST has 27 tracks
[4:10:38] <+vaderxyz1970> @peachy996 Execpt hoodwinked husbands
[4:10:41] <peachy996> But you can see holdovers from LoF in this and it's worse
[4:10:48] <%Monkeyweed21> Observer was existential scary
[4:10:49] <+DoktorZee> @takutoots yes
[4:10:49] <mark_collins45> cox, heh
[4:10:52] <%crimsonharvest> wow is boring as shit if what you want is to sit down and play the video game
[4:10:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> Murdered a couple of months ago.... released on good behavior? That story doesn't add up.
[4:10:57] <%caramelatte1> Hes at the start of 5.3
[4:11:04] <%Monkeyweed21> He loves it way more than Wow lol
[4:11:09] <peachy996> @KaiserMario Sweet is there a playlist on youtub
[4:11:09] <TheAntiNihilist> @takutoots Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs a better game in general
[4:11:11] <%crimsonharvest> i saw Jesse finish 5.2
[4:11:21] <Uselesswhitenoise> pat do you think with your expertise in horror games you could survive a horror game in real life
[4:11:26] <%crimsonharvest> He's really sharp at picking up the narrative in FF14
[4:11:27] <%luftraumm1> he's a fun guy
[4:11:29] <KaiserMario> @peachy996 Not sure, but probably
[4:11:31] <%GarbageNirvana> 5.3 is where that story actually resolves
[4:11:31] <%Monkeyweed21> He's American you
[4:11:32] <%Ranryu692> I let his dick explode in Cyberpunk
[4:11:33] <penitentpendant> He likes to make prediction mid cutscene
[4:11:36] <%FingaLights> He's pretty cool
[4:11:37] <mortificent> Fellow ginger person
[4:11:37] <%luftraumm1> his xiv run was awesome
[4:11:38] <DirtyMiser> The Medium tanked but there is Yakuza remastered on gamepass at least
[4:11:48] <%luftraumm1> he got super invested
[4:11:57] <%Agami23> god damn 5.3
[4:12:06] <+NiktenKing> Fellow big ginger
[4:12:13] <%crimsonharvest> I love Jesse he has such a wide audience and loves everyone
[4:12:14] <StarlitStunner> It‚Äôs been a long time since his OMFG Cata days
[4:12:22] <%Puhff> 5.3 literally made me weep

[4:12:48] <+LionKagura> wow
[4:12:52] <+LionKagura> holy shit dude
[4:12:53] <+MugenSandan> Jesse has a sort of mini-podcast called "Forward and Back Again, A Cox Tale" for anyone interested in a shortened version of his Journey
[4:12:54] <%Monkeyweed21> his streams involve constantly shitting on Wow's story in comparison to ff14

[4:16:49] <+carfar_farcar> the mocapped footage was leaked primarily
[4:17:01] <heartlesshealer> what are you guys showing pat about pathfinder?
[4:17:07] <%Agami23> oh cool. hashtag eattherich is trending

[4:17:16] <drewslo> so I missed it is the medium worth playing
[4:17:17] <%Emperor_Machinus> English
[4:17:21] <jorniev> PLAY OMORI
[4:17:27] <mortificent> nananannananana Pat Man
[4:17:31] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt Library of Ruinia has an English Translation
[4:17:32] <%snugglepuggs> @drewslo no
[4:17:34] <%Agami23> man lobotomy corp is cool but stream poison
[4:17:41] <%DedlokPM> @drewslo pat says no
[4:17:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no
[4:17:45] <+geistuser> Hows the migraine?
[4:17:47] <%TheHappyCynic> TheHappyCynic subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Missed the stream due to work. Sucks that it sounds like medium isn't what it was cracked up to be. Maybe we are reaching the limit on trying to recapture old ideas and franchises like Silent Hill and should focus on trying to do new things instead.
[4:17:47] <+NiktenKing> Omori is neat
[4:17:48] <+Pilau32> Omori would be good
[4:17:48] <+WizoSavage> just 5%?

[4:18:10] <Pookiedaexzile> Medium is Medium as fuck
[4:18:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> @drewslo seemed pretty boring, but apparently we got halfway through it today
