[0:14:00] <+mcjimbo12> @AngriestPat the TLDR on wow in the last 3 years is that there were some really great (but slightly flawed) systems in the previous expansion that the whiny baby playerbase were whiny babies about, so now we just have watered-down versions of those systems and it sucks big dingdong

[0:31:40] <Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 wanted to know if I had a crowdfund for like 1000 dollars, we'd all donate the amount to you if you did a challenge run or a rougelite successful run, while your parents were in the background on speaker(or on headphones, whatever) detailing their sexcapades to you, while paige mocked your losses, made heartbeat sounds, or stuck the fingers from one hand into the open "OK" sign in her other hand.
[0:31:43] <Rygart121> foolishness

[0:33:21] <Eskalon> I cant find the purple orb in this mission :(
[0:33:21] <%sshen> They haven't recorded it yet, pat has been ill lately
[0:33:24] <helpmeimafruit> SDT and the Royal Guard buffs destroys every Dante boss even in SoS, especially since like 8 perfect guards gives you SSS and gives you a free SDT combo
[0:33:25] <KeiPrime> u stink loser
[0:33:25] <$ooblagis> @AngriestPat I was watching the VoD from last night and I noticed some confusion on if Distortion works. It does. It does about 3000 damage, as opposed to the regular DT damage of 2000
[0:33:26] <Valdorick> Paid money to be told you stink!
[0:33:31] <%Kravedarknesss> is the music not playing or am I deaf?

[0:34:29] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[0:34:33] <%jiin6> pvpMotivated but is pat motivated to use Royal Guard?
[0:34:38] <%Real_Todd_Howard> The best use I saw for royal guard is using it to keep Vergil stuck in his devil trigger phase so you don't have to fight his final human phase
[0:34:41] <%kiiiirsten> @CappuccinoGuil Welcome brotha apatLiz
[0:34:50] <Gruhunchously> It's like Dante's Inferno, but actually good. And not taking itself so damn seriously.
[0:34:56] <+TheoTTree> Chaos might be my favourite enemy to fight. Breaking their blade spikes is so satisfying
[0:34:57] <%Agami23> using faust on the lizards while they spin seems to break their blades every time.
[0:34:58] <+waterbuddy16> goin full wahoo

[0:35:14] <%hntronium> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatCrazy
[0:35:15] <Paradocks23> You can also stay in Devil trigger for the entire boss combo since perfect guard gives a full bar of DT back. Even if you're in DT. @angriestpat

[0:43:25] <+jotaro_cooljo> don't forget that enemy step, it's super easy to do. also rainstorm with E&I to avoid attacks since you can still move during it @AngriestPat
[0:43:31] <+TheoTTree> King Cerberus is genuinely super tough
[0:43:34] <kalinflip> @ooblagis I can see it in the finsihed product
[0:43:34] <%QueequegTheater> @ooblagis Over DmC's reception, not the game
[0:43:35] <Tha_Mik> Here we go
[0:43:39] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Real_Todd_Howard how's the bethesda offices after FO76's release?

[0:44:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@TheoTTree) (warning)
[0:44:28] <benjiFG> haha he said berial
[0:44:28] <deathsmions1> he said the shat word
[0:44:28] <BunnyEmperor> Cerberus King exposed, he is only King because he ate the other cerberi
[0:44:29] <anuchallengertwitch> Dante's too tired to not curse
[0:44:29] <%terminallyCapriciousz> COOLGUYSDON'T SWEAR
[0:44:30] <Pillagius> Pat just use a green star Kappa

[0:44:46] <Ner234> Hey guys is it true that Vergil reacts to taunts?
[0:44:49] <Fear_Ranjer> Cerby!
[0:44:53] <%SaltyDongs> Can you royal guard the explosions?
[0:44:53] <%Real_Todd_Howard> @terminallyCapriciousz well we've finally finished cleaning out the first third and we're having a furniture sale in the parking lot next saturday so all in all things are looking up
[0:44:55] <$ooblagis> Funny how they try and make Berial out to be a big deal, when even base level Nero rocked him with zero effort
[0:44:56] <Supabait> berial took 1 bullet to the face and died
[0:44:58] <%QueequegTheater> You can Royal Guard literally everything
[0:45:00] <%lolslowking> @Ner234 Absolutely
[0:45:01] <santystuffs> Considering Berial is the son of Mundus it's surprising Cerberus flames are actually stronger
[0:45:01] <kalinflip> @Ner234 I havent seen it, I tried tho
[0:45:03] <Bust_ER> is this DMD?
[0:45:04] <Valdorick> Exactly, Berial is a punk bitched who died to some no one.
[0:45:05] <$valriot> @grayjammer Yeah but theyre kind of unclesr hitboxes and they hit twice
[0:45:05] <OkamiDude15> @Ner234 at S rank and above yes. it even zooms in on him doing it
[0:45:08] <dukenux> Kamiya turning in his grave Kappa
[0:45:13] <kalinflip> good to know
[0:45:15] <Ner234> @OkamiDude15 That's so cool
[0:45:15] <%AllYouCanYeet> @Ner234 yeah, he'll say something to the effect of "you mock me!"
[0:45:17] <BunnyEmperor> You can Royal Guard Berials explosion in 4 so probably this too
[0:45:20] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Real_Todd_Howard I'm glad, I really want things to go well for you guys <3 Never liked your games though.
[0:45:21] <+ItsAGundamu> This boss was harder than Virgil for me
[0:45:24] <%QueequegTheater> Berial got killed by dead weight
[0:45:28] <T_Sasquatch> is it just me or do the bosses from mission 15 onwards get hard as fuck
[0:45:30] <$valriot> Fireworks best for these orbs
[0:45:31] <Gruhunchously> @dukenux The grave of his own design.
[0:45:32] <santystuffs> Missed opportunity for an Alastor callback here

[0:46:12] <+Plankman> Nero killed berial, but he got better
[0:46:19] <BunnyEmperor> Bael is the Frog, 2nd boss in DMC4
[0:46:20] <%AkronymCLT> Wow Cerberus you really do like name dropping huh?

[0:46:47] <benjiFG> why doesn't pat use air trick

[0:52:07] <%Konquerer> he would turn into a pizza with pineapples on it

[0:52:11] <%cherubs_anonymous> Is he gonna eat that napkin
[0:52:11] <VritraReiRei> He would have took one bite, spit it out, then said, "This isn't PIZZA!"

[0:53:22] <Fear_Ranjer> Eeeeeeh.... debatable
[0:53:22] <+d00msdaydan> now he just looks like a big dark souls boss
[0:53:28] <%QueequegTheater> Is Crew Cut still takin notes
[0:53:29] <$ooblagis> DMD even mission 17 Urizen is a bitch and a half
[0:53:30] <Pillagius> But Pat, Urizen never existed! :D
[0:53:33] <Mr_216> Good thing Vergil is way tougher
[0:53:34] <dukenux> You're basicly fighting Sauron here
[0:53:35] <%Dingus_Tickler> Man, I wish Onimusha Warlords would get that sweet Remake treatment that RE2 got
[0:53:35] <+TheoTTree> Disagree; his summoned swords are scary shit
[0:53:35] <Flyrant> this on SoS or DMD?
[0:53:36] <%Solidnick18> i like this phase of him
[0:53:38] <Zombrocom> Air trick ruins him I find
[0:53:40] <+redascendant1> Whoa, change of scenery
[0:53:40] <CuttleCrow> he's Ur izen

[0:53:46] <%jiin6> UR IZEN
[0:53:47] <$ooblagis> @Flyrant SoS
[0:53:49] <Shishi1205> Why do the demon kings always suck compared to their underlings?
[0:53:50] <%Dioliciouss> he gonna die at one pip again
[0:53:51] <%AllYouCanYeet> it's like an arkham situation where it can't outshine the Vergil fight
[0:53:53] <OkamiDude15> cant wait fot crew cut to be released as the new character
[0:53:54] <Flyrant> ok thanks everyone!
[0:53:56] <%willjar313> Dude's got those Dark Souls Mimic kicks...
[0:53:56] <%sshen> Urizen is literally YOUR REASON
[0:53:57] <$valriot> I find him easy, Rainstorm is huge cheese
[0:53:58] <OldManDeckardCain> he heard pat talk shiet LUL
[0:54:03] <$MightyMaxT> I don't know if I love or hate that URIZEN is a stand in for YOUR REASON
[0:54:04] <Paradocks23> Oh no! He heard you talking shit!
[0:54:05] <%ScreamingMeat> It's because he no longer has his shield or the fucking tendrils
[0:54:10] <UnderpaidBob> now he's motivated
[0:54:11] <VHLW> honestly the crazy thing is probably having to fight this urizen in bloody palace
[0:54:12] <Gruhunchously> Played college ball you know!
[0:54:17] <iforgottousername> Im doing this on SOS too, but I'm using rebellion instead of DSS
[0:54:19] <Valdorick> @Shishi1205 Clearly, because they have to multispec into administration Kappa
[0:54:27] <+TheoTTree> Good point; what bosses are we expecting for BP?
[0:54:29] <RoboXGP> I never noticed urizen messed up the ground
[0:54:31] <Ner234> The fact that he's so HUGE and STILL manages to flash step is impressive.
[0:54:31] <%dave323dave> man if playable vergil could do some of this shit
[0:54:38] <Tucker0603> his animation feels odd
[0:54:45] <$ooblagis> I love that wherever he steps he turns the ground to goo
[0:54:46] <VHLW> @TheoTTree I think they said every boss
[0:54:52] <Flyrant> enemy step makes everything easier
[0:54:53] <CybertronPrime> Urizen taking a knee there is a clear indicator of a Buster opportunity.
[0:54:54] <gogoszy> Aretmis lasers, goliath fireballs, geryon time stop, anything else?
[0:54:58] <+TheoTTree> @VHLW What the hell really?
[0:54:58] <+0oki> what difficulty is this?
[0:54:59] <%sshen> Considering there's an animation for V killing vergil, I'm saying vergils in it
[0:55:02] <Gruhunchously> He's SHATTERING the ILLUSION
[0:55:03] <$ESP_ROOT> malphas teleport
[0:55:04] <%FrustratedAF> SCUM what foolishness is this "motor cycle"
[0:55:04] <%Real_Todd_Howard> I think one of the best features of the later play throughs of this game are Neros Dt grabs on the staggered bosses
[0:55:06] <%QueequegTheater> @MightyMaxT He isn't. Urizen is a character in William Blake's fiction. WHich means V made up the "your reason" line for a pun only he would get
[0:55:10] <SpaceGuntank> to me he never really seemd all that powered up after eating the fruit
[0:55:10] <+TheoTTree> Even stuff like Gilgamesh?
[0:55:12] <+timblenaut> i didnt notice that where he stands becomes bloody
[0:55:16] <BunnyEmperor> this time field is the worst
[0:55:17] <$ESP_ROOT> gilgamesh tentacles
[0:55:18] <Pillagius> @jiin6 I think Urizen is just a game of words, sort of. Like Hodor - "hold the door", so "Urizen" is "Your reason", like in V's sentences when he hired Dante: "your reason to fight"
[0:55:19] <%jiin6> Motor Cycle his Crotch
[0:55:19] <Shishi1205> Still summon swords
[0:55:22] <spykeu> spykeu subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[0:55:38] <AllenDeadman> oh yeah, this is much better
[0:55:40] <gogoszy> Urizen is also a figure in Willaim Blake's Poerty.
[0:55:42] <+TheoTTree> PogChamp
[0:55:44] <$ooblagis> Urizen is named after a William Blake character, who is name after "Your Reason"
[0:55:48] <h33lbr1ng3r> has Pat recorded the rest of the playtrough with Woolie?
[0:55:49] <%Agami23> shooting his summon swords gives toooons of DT
[0:55:55] <%Real_Todd_Howard> Zoning Characters WeirdChamp
[0:55:56] <%lolslowking> Notice how those bolts come down in a V
[0:55:59] <Shishi1205> This is reminding me of the fucking ancient leshen fight in mhw
[0:56:01] <jubejube56> geeze even his artemis shots are in the shape of a V
[0:56:06] <Valdorick> This mother fucker shoots in Vs
[0:56:10] <%spykeu> wait did i just never notice wacky yahoo man during dante's missions????
[0:56:10] <helpmeimafruit> duel to the death with your fallen brother who just lost his soul -> Dante: WAHOOOHHOHOHOOO
[0:56:15] <Graxe_> Man, Ground Trick from Trickster is so good.
[0:56:16] <%Ahack13> The fact dante makes the stupid karate noises durring like the most important fight ever is amazing
[0:56:18] <%jiin6> So the Final Boss is Poetry, how wierd
[0:56:21] <+ill_sage> infinite air revolvers a strong tool
[0:56:37] <%Kurt_0> i had no idea you started at 7 and now ive missed almost an hour of stream
[0:56:37] <Graxe_> Dante basically gets Vergil's movement with it.
[0:56:39] <+ItsAGundamu> Sin Devil Trigger is so fucking Busted
[0:56:39] <Paradocks23> Not the final boss
[0:56:41] <SpaceGuntank> it would've been soo cool if he finished him with that

[0:57:13] <%spiritofmojave> Dante had to go through the trauma of losing his brother twice, and mother.
[0:57:14] <%Real_Todd_Howard> Vergil is such an idiot

[1:00:33] <santystuffs> @AngriestPat according to the game library absorving the Sparda and Eating the Fruit are basically the same power boost
[1:00:33] <%AllyBeeBoo> if vergil has white hair why doesn't dante have it too!?

[1:01:05] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater that's typical Japanese corporate politeness
[1:01:06] <anuchallengertwitch> The human factor makes all the difference
[1:01:13] <OkamiDude15> maybe thats what his finisher was doing to all those demons
[1:01:16] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater he doesn't want DmC fans to backlash against the game and not buy it
[1:01:18] <$ooblagis> And a wig
[1:01:19] <+TheoTTree> "I wasn't IN your way Dante"
[1:01:19] <xtremegamer80> Is that the sccript?
[1:01:21] <%GueyDuckB> put a wig on V
[1:01:21] <dukenux> V would die if he didn't merge with Urizen
[1:01:22] <xtremegamer80> *Script?
[1:01:23] <blackbookalpha> Vergil's true strength is his humanity?

[1:01:58] <Fear_Ranjer> I wonder if what he says to Nero in Japanese is different from the translation

[1:04:10] <+timblenaut> patricide is worse than brother killing brother, history is pretty firm on that

[1:04:13] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> He's not gonna kill Vergil. Just kick his ass a bit

[1:06:05] <degamk619> I don’t have a father I just want to take a piss that’s all
[1:06:08] <%QueequegTheater> Piss on the camera while you insult us
[1:06:08] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater guys like Itsuno are diplomatic unlike Tameem; they don't go around stirring up the beehive; doesn't mean that what he says for PR purposes reflect his true feelings
[1:06:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Devil May Piss
[1:06:11] <CuttleCrow> 👉 Breeding time 👈
[1:06:17] <%spiritofmojave> Pat May Cry? Pat May Shit and Piss?

[1:06:20] <+Plankman> what the HELL are you dOOOING
[1:06:35] <Seitine> Gingers Sometimes Piss
[1:06:39] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Anybody else worried about Sekiro since there will be no early copies and the review embargo is post launch?
[1:06:42] <lucianon96plays> @plankman shitting
[1:06:49] <Paradocks23> Ginger May Pee
[1:06:50] <helpmeimafruit> Microsoft E3 2023: Tameem comes up on stage: "DmC IS BACK!"
[1:06:57] <Tha_Mik> I'm not pissing it's the rain
[1:06:57] <%willjar313> @QueequegTheater "Take this money that I am pissing upon you, with my ANCIENT GOD DICK!"
[1:07:01] <lucianon96plays> @plainsimpletailor nahhh, it's gonna be cool.
[1:07:06] <danknugglit> Ginger may pee 2
[1:07:09] <AlasterAngelo> @PlainSimpleTailor who cares about reviews
[1:07:10] <AutechreTwinAphex> @PlainSimpleTailor yeah it is puzzling; TBH I am cautiously optimistic about it now but I still have it preordered
[1:07:11] <$HentaiSenpai9K> @plainsimpletailor Bruh it's From Software. Everything they've made is a masterpiece
[1:07:14] <CuttleCrow> Sekiro probably won't be better than DMC5
[1:07:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm going to be pissed if he doesn't have any trouble on Vergil. That was the first time this game actually got hard
[1:07:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Devil May Dump The Bucket
[1:07:21] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex He wouldn't say it's his favorite game unless it was. I'm not defending Tameem, the guy is an idiot. But trying to pretend like DmC never happened is asinine and willfully ignorant of the fact that Itsuno himself really liked the game
[1:07:29] <Realimpact> nameof the song pls?
[1:07:40] <CybertronPrime> I'm not worried. Mainly because I've kinda already written off Sekiro as another Dark Souls. Because that's seemingly the only kind of game FromSoft can make now.
[1:07:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sekiro will probably be better than DMC 5.
[1:07:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> @PlainSimpleTailor it's funny too; before DMC5 came out, I was cautiously optimistic about DMC5 and thought Sekiro was going to be a guaranteed masterpiece; now I'm kinda on the opposite end
[1:07:43] <%PlainSimpleTailor> @HentaiSenpai9K Maybe they'll finally learn how to have NPCs that fucking emote?
[1:07:45] <%sshen> Itsuno tried to resign after DmC came out man
[1:07:47] <$valriot> @helpmeimafruit Bunch of shitty journalists start writing their "Is DmC 2 Vergil a Trump metaphor articles"
[1:08:01] <%Ion_Laser> @valriot seriously?
[1:08:04] <+bubbli97> @AngriestPat is the rocket launcher even useful against Vergil?
[1:08:04] <%spiritofmojave> There's a lot of clear DmC influence in this, but it's really more like a class-act way of Itsuno seeing the good-concepts and executing them in a way they SHOULD have been done.
[1:08:05] <$HentaiSenpai9K> That's not critical tho 😂
[1:08:05] <weontheultralightbeam> :)
[1:08:05] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat your zipper is undone
[1:08:09] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex If he didn't then why would Reuben straight up say that Itsuno was disheartened/disillusioned by the game's negative reception among fans?
[1:08:10] <zerocruz> Devil may cry, devil my piss his pants, devil may shit and cum ?
[1:08:11] <lucianon96plays> @plainsimpletailor Not like it's made by EA or Bethesda.
[1:08:11] <BunnyEmperor> nice you didnt fall into the toilet this time Kappa
[1:08:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> @PlainSimpleTailor I will say that after RE2 and DMC5 that I am spoiled in terms of graphics and it will be hard going back to From's slightly dated engine at this point
[1:08:13] <BlackMagicMarvus> ALMOST 3 MILLION ORBS!!
[1:08:14] <saiyan24675> Hey

[1:10:28] <%GarbageNirvana> Well that's Bayo's thing now
[1:10:34] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater he clearly told Reuben something completely different than what he told the press in PR interviews

[1:11:03] <$ESP_ROOT> SourPls
[1:11:06] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex He told Reuben that he was extremely unhappy that DmC, a game he put a lot of work into, was hated by most of the fanbase
[1:11:17] <Shishi1205> Wait a second if they were made from the memory of vergil how do they remember about the fights with dante
[1:11:18] <%jiin6> beat up Asian Iago...wait...
[1:11:19] <Them00n> @angriestpat How far into this game is Woolie?
[1:11:20] <%Verd_254> Anyone else really dig DSD over Rebellion? Seen a lot of people complaining swordmaster was ruined but I like it even more now.
[1:11:21] <%ScreamingMeat> Does this Griffon even have the original's memories?
[1:11:34] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater he was brought in last minute having to clean up Ninja Theory's mess - he was not in charge of the main design or direction
[1:11:38] <helpmeimafruit> no, he's just a figment of vergil's mind
[1:11:39] <Megapikman132> it's unclear
[1:11:40] <%Svanyr> Oh god he makes the noises
[1:11:42] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater like DMC2 he had to clean up other people's mess
[1:11:46] <+TheoTTree> King Cerberus is probably my favourite weapon
[1:11:49] <BunnyEmperor> I dont think he has the memeories from dmc1
[1:11:50] <Tha_Mik> So it is THE Griffon?
[1:11:50] <+TheoTTree> It's so good
[1:11:51] <%supersugoisenpai1> I love Dante's kung fu noises
[1:11:53] <+timblenaut> WOOLIE
[1:11:53] <%spiritofmojave> It's Vergil's mind manifesting them pretty sure
[1:11:53] <%jiin6> all he needs now, is to mention LIIIIIGHT
[1:11:55] <+Plankman> Dante's new summoned swords are SO cool
[1:11:56] <%ohdamnitseric> ohdamnitseric subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:11:59] <OkamiDude15> i wish nightmare had his cool armor like in dmc1
[1:11:59] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex It wasn't last minute, he was there for more than just three months
[1:12:00] <%willjar313> Dante is just the biggest fuckin' goober ever.
[1:12:00] <$ooblagis> My one complaint about the story of 5 is that they didn't bring back Mundus and focused solely on Virgil
[1:12:02] <$ESP_ROOT> PogChamp
[1:12:06] <%SaltyDongs> SaltyDongs subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! Where's my mustard muther?
[1:12:13] <$ooblagis> Didn't leave much for a climax
[1:12:17] <RoboXGP> 5 is like a bleach movie or something
[1:12:18] <%BigNerdSam> Oh shit, Woolie' streaming. Time to look at his stream titties.
[1:12:18] <AlasterAngelo> @QueequegTheater boy I sure would like if a series was taken from under me and then forced back onto me because they fucked it up so bad that's the dream
[1:12:18] <%ScreamingMeat> So then why does Griffon and the other summons want to kill Dante so bad?
[1:12:19] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater yeah - flown in at the last minute as I said - 3 months is nearly identical to the time he spent on DMC2
[1:12:21] <Flyrant> @Verd_254 I think the problem is that a lot of built up muscle memory makes DSD awkward to use for a lot of people
[1:12:25] <%Big_Dream> mundus is dead so
[1:12:25] <@Fuggins4U> awww
[1:12:26] <pshuuu> no faust hat? what a coward. hes so close to 3m

[1:12:36] <%Big_Dream> why bring him back
[1:12:37] <+EvilSoully> V's summons do suicide by cop into Dante to free Vergil from his fucked up memories, right?
[1:12:41] <%jiin6> MUSTARD, Mutherrrrr
[1:12:41] <CuttleCrow> Which of the music DLC(s) are worth getting, if any?

[1:13:06] <Sanyle> @Verd_254 i love it because id been talking to my friend about it, i ended up realizing that the main swordmaster moves should be into the main moveset and replaced with something else because why wouldnt i choose those extra moves for more style?
[1:13:08] <anuchallengertwitch> @EvilSoully pretty much
[1:13:11] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater probably to actually execute the idea in a good way?
[1:13:11] <derekwst3> I keep hearing get off that dick son
[1:13:12] <RoboXGP> here comes the butthole elevator
[1:13:12] <%QueequegTheater> What with constantly praising NT, referencing it in his games
[1:13:14] <%zeroarturia> @Verd_254 I prefer DSD more then rebellion especially it can create its own summon swords variant

[1:13:44] <+misterfistor> i wish it looked more like rebellion
[1:13:45] <%Kravedarknesss> the texture for that bloody hair is really good

[1:13:48] <%MagickBurritoh> Dante is Sparda and Rebellion so yeah

[1:14:02] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater the Trickster moves in DMC2 were cool too; doesn't mean DMC2 is anything but crap
[1:14:03] <Valdorick> Its my belief that Itsuno 1 - is just a polite guy and isn't going to shit on Ninja Theory, and 2 - Consulted to them about the things that work in that game, like the hit stop, and screen zoom.
[1:14:03] <%jiin6> THEY SHARED THE COLD

[1:14:24] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex Trickster doesn't share any moves with DMC2
[1:14:25] <Valdorick> Its a good game, but a shit story. Or, in short "Dante is a gay boy, he is not the emo villain kid from Chronicle"

[1:14:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dante is a sexy hobo grandpa.
[1:14:45] <Gruhunchously> I hope Paige returns to her normal level of sick soon.
[1:14:50] <zerocruz> Don’t hurt the boi
[1:14:50] <%Agami23> im surprised they didnt give shadow a move that would cause him to self destruct
[1:14:52] <+TheoTTree> I love this level; such a goodamn victory lap for the series
[1:14:53] <+Plankman> that launcher ULES
[1:14:56] <+metalsiren31> I love that they use the DMC1 music there
[1:15:05] <Sanyle> pat revving it up over here
[1:15:05] <Flyrant> @AngriestPat will you do a DMD playthrough?
[1:15:06] <RoboXGP> dante looks like a mexican in this
[1:15:06] <jubejube56> same
[1:15:10] <Deano8817> fucking same
[1:15:10] <$ooblagis> That is pretty goofy
[1:15:12] <%spiritofmojave> I hated it on DMD
[1:15:14] <KZN02> El donte
[1:15:14] <MONSTR_UwU> black peepee to stronk
[1:15:14] <%psychocalibur> gunslinger w/ double kalianna ann makes the fight pretty easy
[1:15:16] <$ESP_ROOT> the boss fight is actually fun
[1:15:18] <bleugh> what difficulty is this on
[1:15:18] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @Flyrant he said not on stream
[1:15:22] <Gruhunchously> 'Hate' as in it's badly designed or 'hate' as in it's hard?
[1:15:25] <Flyrant> :(
[1:15:26] <%terminallyCapriciousz> @bleugh son of sparda
[1:15:27] <Shishi1205> son of
[1:15:28] <+TheoTTree> Fun fact: You can do the donut attack FOREVER. I mashed it out for a full minute in the void
[1:15:28] <%Ion_Laser> @bleugh son of sparda
[1:15:29] <PrinceOfEden> @TheSpiritof2277 Same, one stray punch from nightmare fucking hurt.
[1:15:32] <%Kravedarknesss> @bleugh SOS
[1:15:41] <Skeleton_Boner_Lord> Dante saw bloodborne`s pizza cutter and was like gotta get me some of that
[1:15:50] <$valriot> I dont mind this one, Geryon is the worst
[1:15:51] <+jkobe34> so who's ex provocation you going to get
[1:15:56] <helpmeimafruit> Use gunslinger kalina ann to down griffon in two hits
[1:15:57] <+trekkie11041> it would have been cool if he said rest in peace feather face
[1:16:03] <%spiritofmojave> @PrinceOfEden Ikr, I think I had more 'give ups' there than Vergil
[1:16:04] <%J_Papa> What's the point of destroying those roots btw?
[1:16:06] <Sanyle> okay can someone tell me what pat destroyed just now actually does?
[1:16:06] <%Konquerer> you know what works really well on griffon, GUNSLINGER
[1:16:08] <%Big_Dream> is wrong i like playing nero more than dante
[1:16:11] <+EvilSoully> Dante is such a fucking nerd
[1:16:13] <PrinceOfEden> Fun Fact; If you kill Shadow before griffin shows up, it ends the fight immediately.
[1:16:17] <stirlingw17> Pat what you feel is the best weapon in this game for dante?
[1:16:19] <+Plankman> is that a fuckin AIR RAID?!
[1:16:21] <AllenDeadman> that baphomet got fucked
[1:16:22] <danknugglit> Wah
[1:16:27] <PrinceOfEden> It also actually ends the fight immediately if you kill Shadow first.
[1:16:27] <pshuuu> @J_Papa they spawn blocks at the boss that drop health orbs
[1:16:29] <%Kravedarknesss> @big_dream Nah Nero is great
[1:16:32] <Flyrant> Nero is a lot of fun
[1:16:36] <%spiritofmojave> That would take some Faust magic to work I'd bet
[1:16:38] <AlasterAngelo> all of Dante's weapons are the best one
[1:16:40] <+HoloToast> that bapho-met his match DendiFace
[1:16:43] <anuchallengertwitch> What does everybody think Vergil's ex provocation will be?
[1:16:48] <RoboXGP> those insects are so uesless
[1:16:48] <Gruhunchously> Nero really came into his own.
[1:16:51] <%GarbageNirvana> So how big would Dante's scarf be with Dr. Faust right now since Pat's red orb count is in the millions
[1:16:54] <%willjar313> Just tearing through these motherfuckers like a fat kid through cake.
[1:17:00] <PrinceOfEden> @TheSpiritof2277 Yeah, nothing hurts more in DMD than getting the boss down to like 3 hits and he fucking kills you.
[1:17:04] <+TheoTTree> All of Dante's weapons are more complex than any of the weapons he's had before except MAYBE Lucifer
[1:17:10] <%QueequegTheater> LUL
[1:17:13] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[1:17:14] <%Big_Dream> vergil ex will be like some classical weeb music
[1:17:16] <%thewildzubat> Man I can't wait for Dante to kill Thanos in Endgame
[1:17:16] <NotHereToStream> big whiff
[1:17:17] <AlasterAngelo> Devil Sword Dante is some next level shit
[1:17:18] <$valriot> @anuchallengertwitch It should be Summon Swords making a chair and he sits down and reads a book
[1:17:23] <Flyrant> Getting an S on certain DMD missions is painful
[1:17:26] <$ESP_ROOT> is distorted real impact still a thing?
[1:17:31] <Limes528> Well you're in luck...
[1:17:32] <@Fuggins4U> batmofos begins
[1:17:35] <pshuuu> mission 10 is just retarded
[1:17:41] <OkamiDude15> @ESP_ROOT not as far as i know
[1:17:42] <Gruhunchously> If this was Duke Nukem those would be wall-tits.
[1:17:44] <SpaceGuntank> i just lame out the bats with the bazooka
[1:17:46] <0rond> this mission's boss is actually harder than vergil on SoS
[1:17:48] <Flyrant> @ESP_ROOT as far as I'm aware it is not
[1:17:48] <%Kravedarknesss> woah camera
[1:17:53] <stirlingw17> @Flyrant especially on nero
[1:17:53] <AlasterAngelo> IGNITE THE FLAM
[1:17:53] <+trekkie11041> the bats are way less annoying as nero
[1:17:54] <RoboXGP> the insects have tits on their noggins
[1:17:54] <AlasterAngelo> NOW
[1:17:55] <Deano8817> gauntlets in dmc6 but they give you literally Kazuma Kiryu's moveset
[1:17:57] <+TheoTTree> I actually think that this game has the best enemy roster of all DMC games with the exclusion of 1 because of how different it plays
[1:18:01] <%Big_Dream> i miss alatsor you get balrog but not lighting sword
[1:18:02] <PrinceOfEden> Go home Camera, you're drunk.
[1:18:03] <benjiFG> ! camera at risk !
[1:18:25] <Gruhunchously> The camera is not on side, it's gone rogue.
[1:18:26] <weontheultralightbeam> this mission is almost impossible to S rank
[1:18:27] <+EvilSoully> So, is this Pat's game of the year so far then?
[1:18:39] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat do you have unlocks minus the ex taunts?
[1:18:43] <AlasterAngelo> IGNITE THE FLAME
[1:18:43] <$valriot> Trish will probably get Alastor if shes added
[1:18:44] <AlasterAngelo> IGNITE IT
[1:18:47] <0rond> this mission is ridiculously hard
[1:18:51] <0rond> the boss really
[1:18:52] <+HoloToast> kick the kitty
[1:18:54] <danknugglit> Almost 3 mill rorbs PogChamp
[1:18:56] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater I sure must have imagined that wall running and wall jump then in DMC3
[1:19:06] <PrinceOfEden> I just got Nero's EX taunt today, next will be Dantes then Vs.
[1:19:09] <Gruhunchously> 'Watch the birdie'. I haven't heard that one in years.
[1:19:10] <Flyrant> ouch
[1:19:16] <PrinceOfEden> I also realized Nero had a gum taunt that heals him
[1:19:17] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex Took you a while
[1:19:18] <zerocruz> Anyone having trouble S ranking mission ?
[1:19:25] <anuchallengertwitch> @TheoTTree I agree. Even just visually the enemies in this game are awesome. The Fury as a concept of being an evolved demon is cool. Though I still have a soft spot for the enemies in Dmc1.
[1:19:30] <zerocruz> 10
[1:19:30] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater I'm not around all the time here
[1:19:42] <Ner234> Who does he plan on buying the Ex Taunt for first?
[1:19:46] <vendrys1> this is literally the only mission i havent s ranked on SoS and DMD, just watching someone else play it is triggering me rn
[1:19:47] <PrinceOfEden> @zerocruz That's the prologue dante one right?
[1:19:52] <pshuuu> @zerocruz yeah that shit is insane. its like you have to do a no damage run
[1:19:53] <jubejube56> Did griffon do anything that fight?
[1:19:55] <zerocruz> Yep
[1:19:57] <Gruhunchously> Using a motorcycle to chainsaw a demon panther in the face.
[1:19:58] <benjiFG> I clapped
[1:20:00] <$valriot> @zerocruz Yeah, everyone is lmao it actually seems like it might be bugged, you can literally skip all the encounters and have the same rank
[1:20:00] <danknugglit> Nero ex first
[1:20:05] <+Plankman> NASTY
[1:20:07] <Vvvzzzlllvvvzzzlllvvv> @QueequegTheate "why don't you glue your eyes to a twitch chat like a normal human would"
[1:20:07] <AllenDeadman> I'm so glad dante actually said it
[1:20:08] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@valkuma) (warning)
[1:20:08] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex And fine. One similar animation is different from EX costumes in two games, the entire look of the Qliphoth, and the entire last two mission
[1:20:08] <+ItsAGundamu> Its technically 4 though
[1:20:10] <%NWR_James> that shit's gross
[1:20:12] <$ESP_ROOT> DansGame
[1:20:13] <$DarkKnightGrave> You mean 4
[1:20:14] <Ipsenscastle> he says, fighting them in 4
[1:20:15] <0rond> shadow 's attacks aren't telgraphed and some of them like the aoe apikes are huge and pretty much instant, and nightmare's hitboxes are insane
[1:20:29] <%Agami23> i feel like it was a big missed opportunity rnot to have phantom show up
[1:20:30] <PrinceOfEden> I had to redo it once yeah, I wouldn't say it was impossible, but style points were fucking essential for that.
[1:20:30] <%QueequegTheater> Guys he means fight each of them three times
[1:20:31] <domu_kujira_kohi> BEST SONG
[1:20:34] <PrinceOfEden> @zerocruz
[1:20:34] <AllenDeadman> hey nightmare
[1:20:35] <anuchallengertwitch> Mental Machine
[1:20:35] <%sshen> Your end rank is decided by how long during certain fights you stayed at S or above, so ending them too quickly is actually a detriment

[1:20:49] <stirlingw17> this music holy shit
[1:20:56] <weontheultralightbeam> The aerial bike moves destroys nightmare
[1:20:59] <stirlingw17> I think this is the first time I've really listend to it
[1:21:04] <+EvilSoully> Woops
[1:21:06] <$valriot> These remixes are so good
[1:21:07] <AlasterAngelo> this actually looks like an awful place to die dante
[1:21:11] <danknugglit> Every song is best song
[1:21:12] <AutechreTwinAphex> @QueequegTheater thank god they didn't take from DmC the insanely crap platforming; you should never ever fall into a void in a Devil May Cry game; especially not in combat arenas
[1:21:13] <Flyrant> yeah but he uses his health to heal the other too, so you can hit them as well
[1:21:15] <pshuuu> killing the others drains nightmares health when he revives them. so theyre all real
[1:21:15] <$valriot> Wrong, kinda
[1:21:19] <RoboXGP> if you kill the other guys nightmare uses HP to create them again
[1:21:20] <$ooblagis> Nightmare will feed his HP into the other though
[1:21:21] <Flyrant> other TWO even
[1:21:22] <stirlingw17> @danknugglit except dante's
[1:21:26] <+misterfistor> ??? theyre all from vergils memory
[1:21:29] <AlasterAngelo> oh god thank christ 5 didn't take DmC's platforming
[1:21:30] <+HoloToast> took me a minute to figure that out, I was killing the other ones instead while Nightmare was up sbfpSetIn
[1:21:33] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah Nightmare uses its bar to revive them pretty sure
[1:21:35] <PrinceOfEden> @AlasterAngelo Idk man, a floating demon tornado cane as a Grave Stone seems pretty rad.
[1:21:38] <%spiritofmojave> but it's still better to go head on
[1:21:40] <danknugglit> Damn
[1:21:46] <%QueequegTheater> @AutechreTwinAphex Because DMC's platforming was so much better LUL
[1:21:52] <%GarbageNirvana> It makes sense considering if you summoned Nightmare as V it'd bring the other two back if they were down
[1:21:55] <Deano8817> LUL
[1:21:56] <Gruhunchously> @AutechreTwinAphex I dunno, I thought it really enhanced the gameplay when every attack had the potential to send you hurling into the void.

[1:24:35] <PlumpPotatoRump> there was a reddit post and some maths and shit
[1:24:37] <+TheoTTree> In case you didn't know those pillars are destructible and drop health
[1:24:40] <prooffrock> wait does pat not know that you can get nightmare to break the columns for some green orbs
[1:24:41] <+0oki> I really didn't want to kill them :(
[1:24:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> I sure loved their rationale for not having taunts too - a guy at TGS from Ninja Theory literally said it was not in there because of 'cognitive dissonance reasons' - 'the serious story cannot be interrupted by corny taunts'
[1:24:44] <zerocruz> What about Nero?
[1:24:44] <PsychoFlash1> dante is videogame-mature-old
[1:24:48] <+twohitgood> why no pop dt and heal?
[1:24:48] <ArthurDoyleRPG> No Dante is 69
[1:24:49] <dukenux> Dante is 80 yo, like Aragorn
[1:24:51] <+trekkie11041> that would mean nero is in his mid 20's
[1:24:53] <PrinceOfEden> @TheoTTree FUCKING WHAT?!
[1:24:56] <Bust_ER> Dante and vergil are in their 40s
[1:24:56] <+twohitgood> ah

[1:25:17] <T_Sasquatch> the time difference between 4 and 5 isnt THAT big is it ?
[1:25:19] <Shishi1205> "Dante is approaching 40 in MDC 4
[1:25:21] <$ooblagis> Dante was 28 during DMC1, Anime is like two years later, Patty is 18 now, so 8-12 years have passed. Dante is roughly 38-42
[1:25:23] <+TheoTTree> I also wish I knew that shit LUL
[1:25:25] <Bust_ER> lady is in her late 30s
[1:25:28] <stirlingw17> do you build dt gauge in sin dt?

[1:25:57] <Flyrant> dead
[1:25:58] <AutechreTwinAphex> @PsychoFlash1 yeah not to mention the story was the most laughable of them all and in a non-ironic way
[1:25:58] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Dante is old enough to be an old tired white man in a game, but he's still a whacky wahoo gay cowboy ninja turtle so it cancels out

[1:26:52] <%QueequegTheater> This is going well Kappa
[1:27:07] <AutechreTwinAphex> let's make Vergil a super hacker and let's make him the head of Anonymous and Occupy Wall Street; I loved the depth they added to this existing character; totally not lazy and derivative at all
[1:27:08] <PsychoFlash1> Easy Mode is Now Selectable is one of the moments that made me laugh the hardest in the [OLD CHANNEL]
[1:27:13] <Fear_Ranjer> uuuuuuuugh god I love this remix

By the way Pat, have you had any experience with a bug in Mission 16 where Subhuman won't play? I mean like no dynamic track or anything; just ambient level music. Real weird.
[1:39:32] <+shawntk_> @brickwall35 Because that would lower his rank

[1:39:36] <+emperor_z> I'm on this fight right now. Stuck on the last 25% of his life
[1:39:37] <PrinceOfEden> @TheoTTree I just used the Dante Blades followed by round trip to ground vergil.
[1:39:45] <$SGrim> @brickwall35 some misplaced pride he doesn't deserve to have rooKek

[1:46:44] <+Strogg> Jesus fuck that damage
[1:46:45] <Ultimatefool> The best part is Vergil MOVES INTO FRAME to look cool
[1:46:45] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat you know you can just kill the swords with a few swings right
[1:46:46] <%spiritofmojave> Judgement NUT
[1:46:47] <Tha_Mik> shcum
[1:46:49] <raincoatponch> that was a perfect shot
[1:46:49] <lols_royce> cuting spacetime is one of the coolest sword tropes
[1:46:50] <%primax104> how many tries so far?
[1:46:51] <ArthurDoyleRPG> That's a nope
[1:46:52] <Lukalux3> Wooowww
[1:46:53] <%ThirdWelles> Break those summon swords before you RGC on Vergil's DT
[1:46:55] <+ZeferSenano> Not even Royal Revenge can block that
[1:47:00] <Flyrant> three tries now I think
[1:47:04] <%nameless_majin> GOD DAMN
[1:47:04] <$MightyMaxT> The last judgement nut draweth nigh
[1:47:10] <%sshen> 3 with 1 reset
[1:47:10] <%thewildzubat> Vergil used his all out attack
[1:47:11] <%QueequegTheater> @ZeferSenano You can block it with perfect timing
[1:47:13] <Valdorick> He's little brother because his dick is smaller, DmC said so Kappa
[1:47:16] <stirlingw17> Final judgement nut!
[1:47:18] <PsychoFlash1> holy shit
[1:47:22] <Malziel> God I love that Vegil can also juggle *you*
[1:47:23] <%nameless_majin> yoooo oh my god
[1:47:24] <+misterfistor> yall havent even seen DMD vergil in 3 yet
[1:47:27] <%JaydenSai> FOOLISHNESS
[1:47:28] <+Blaxel411> Vergil sure does love being older by 2 minutes
[1:47:30] <+trekkie11041> you seem to be getting worse KappaHD
[1:47:39] <%ScreamingMeat> @QueequegTheater Yup, hope he's playable in the campaign too.
[1:47:41] <Gruhunchously> He's on tilt
[1:47:43] <AutechreTwinAphex> I do miss one sound byte "INSANE BUFFOON"
[1:47:48] <MONSTR_UwU> @Blaxel411 LUL
[1:47:53] <OkamiDude15> @misterfistor does he do the tracking judgement cut? sfhWOKE
[1:47:58] <RichochetForce> @Valdorick Please remember that studio execs approved those lines, approved the budget to hire voice actors, and voice actors read those lines 10+ times
[1:48:00] <Flyrant> this will go poorly
[1:48:01] <%GarbageNirvana> So Vergil's clearly going to be DLC, right
[1:48:04] <Gogeta957> What if Vergil comes with the styles Dante didnt carry from 3 so he has darkslayer but also doppleganger and quicksilver?
[1:48:05] <BunnyEmperor> too early
[1:48:07] <gustavozxd> this combo A spam hurts my soul
[1:48:08] <CuttleCrow> narrator: i didn't
[1:48:12] <%ThirdWelles> Does a broken royal guard chip, or just hitstun?
[1:48:20] <+misterfistor> @OkamiDude15 yes
[1:48:24] <Deano8817> he teleported into it LUL
[1:48:24] <Tha_Mik> wow
[1:48:28] <Valdorick> I mean really, he should be upset that he's two minutes older, that means he's getting older faster, meaning every second alive is 2 minutes of being weaker than dante who isn't old Kappa
[1:48:29] <%nameless_majin> good luck
[1:48:32] <RichochetForce> That move is glorious
[1:48:33] <BunnyEmperor> he will just heal it out LUL
[1:48:34] <candidateplays> Luce (R2) does the most damage in SDT, I believe
[1:48:34] <OkamiDude15> @misterfistor awesome
[1:48:35] <Paradocks23> Oh dear.
[1:48:36] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat try the SDT R2 button on him next time. That shit does ridiculous damage
[1:48:42] <$ooblagis> Use the Luce when you Sin against Vergil, it's FAR batter
[1:48:43] <+jotaro_cooljo> @AngriestPat the hold R2 move where you shot a bunch for SDT works the best in this fight
[1:48:44] <T_Sasquatch> i sewear vergil gets faster in phase 2
[1:48:44] <benjiFG> SHCUM
[1:48:47] <+xx123manxx> Man, Vergil's so cool
[1:48:48] <Tha_Mik> SHCUM
[1:48:48] <RichochetForce> @Chichen The Luce right? It's obscene
[1:48:52] <%Chichen> @RichochetForce yep
[1:48:53] <+mega_pengers> i hope they make it so that fight can be done playing as vergil as dlc or something
[1:48:53] <+Silentman0> how come vergil can go double trigger when there's no demon sword vergil?
[1:48:53] <+StrawberryPantsu> Playable Lady,Trish,and Virgil when?
[1:48:54] <Morning_Asakura> enemy step :)

[1:48:58] <+HoloToast> did he just enemy step his own brother? brutal
[1:49:01] <%Niney_Who> His Sin Damage is too real
[1:49:01] <blakeout> SDT the luce is crazy good. i found it useful here
[1:49:02] <%Keyd00d> woof
[1:49:02] <Shishi1205> He is not a joke
[1:49:03] <%Nobrev> try using bullet rain to break the swords around you. I've seen people do that @AngriestPat
[1:49:04] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat Try The Luce (SDT R2) on him its disgusting
[1:49:05] <%primax104> n + 2
[1:49:08] <Kefkaisnotamused> Dante napped for too long.
[1:49:12] <+Fnir> why not use shotgun ?
[1:49:12] <+emperor_z> Is it feasible to get style on this fight without using RG?
[1:49:14] <BunnyEmperor> Ready for DMD Pat?
[1:49:15] <Gruhunchously> Ruff
[1:49:18] <Lotharman> Players May Cry
[1:49:19] <%connos_livereview> THIS is devil may cry

[1:49:21] <+Strogg> is this DMD?
[1:49:22] <candidateplays> Why is there a Luce move but no Ombra move? They should have called Demolition that.
[1:49:24] <+iNotOriginal> @angriestpat For the summon swords, use Balrog's jump
[1:49:25] <OkamiDude15> @emperor_z it is
[1:49:25] <%lilytastic> wow pat you suck. it's not like i just ragequit this section 10 minutes ago. on human. no sir.

[1:49:27] <gustavozxd> dmd vergil 3 where he heals more than you in DT LUL
[1:49:29] <OkamiDude15> @Strogg sos
[1:49:30] <+MstrSwrd> @Silentman0 The character bio says that his time spent as Urizen and V helped him better understand his Demonic powers.
[1:49:32] <%QueequegTheater> @emperor_z Yes, you can combo him when you catch him off guard
[1:49:32] <%Tenebrae94> @AngriestPat not gonna taunt him?
[1:49:33] <CuttleCrow> can't you use fireworks to knock the swords off of you?
[1:49:35] <+advoccat> D:
[1:49:38] <Flyrant> just one shot DMD vergil with Dr Faust Kappa
[1:49:40] <Bailey__gaming> that's a nettle game over screen

[1:49:47] <stirlingw17> @CuttleCrow yes
[1:49:50] <+trekkie11041> crazy talk
[1:49:51] <RichochetForce> @candidateplays Good question. I guess because Dante doesn't do Darkness? He's a good boy.
[1:49:55] <Gruhunchously> Remember when Boss Fights were actually hard? Capcom remembers.
[1:49:55] <OkamiDude15> put the faust hat on vergil sfhLUL

[1:52:08] <%AllYouCanYeet> this game slaps
[1:52:14] <%Keyd00d> Pat has downloaded Vergil
[1:52:17] <Shishi1205> How is vergil stinger called again?
[1:52:17] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Thats the sound of Vergil spanking you
[1:52:18] <+advoccat> RHYTHM GAME LUL
[1:52:19] <%Keyd00d> ...nvm
[1:52:21] <gustavozxd> there's only like 4 DMC games actually
[1:52:23] <Gruhunchously> It didn't know this was a rhythm game
[1:52:26] <stirlingw17> @king_strongstyle i find it pretty good if you combo in the weapon switch for cerberous to follow him with revolver
[1:52:27] <WaxWitch> Vergil is the Alpha and Omega after all TPFufun
[1:52:29] <Bailey__gaming> Ddr levels of rhythm practice
[1:52:29] <%Cavumentum> How many easy mode jokes have been made already
[1:52:30] <%willjar313> Can we confirm of deny the rumors that the size of Frustration is, indeed, increasing?
[1:52:38] <blakeout> vergil stinger is rapid slash
[1:52:39] <Flyrant> Pat should really switch to trickster when he gets juggled to tech out of the combo
[1:52:40] <%Ion_Laser> @Cavumentum a lot LUL
[1:52:40] <gustavozxd> 1 3 4 5 there's no other DMC games that's it
[1:52:40] <%Big_Dream> only 4 dmc exist 2 doesn't count and shitty reboot doesn't count
[1:52:41] <+xx123manxx> Only move I have trouble blocking with vergil is his hilt swings
[1:52:41] <+Kawaso> pat: "I can see it! I can see his movements!"
[1:52:53] <%dreamfillah> DMC is honestly so much more brutal than most action games cause you can't regain health in any way in boss fights

[1:53:17] <Onamar> You can combo Vergil a little longer if you launch him

[1:53:34] <$hatesdps> man i put this down until capcom hopefully fixes that awful controller problem on pc where touching the keyboard or mouse locks the game
[1:53:34] <+emperor_z> If you use the checkpoint option on a level with no checkpoints, does it still penalize your score?
[1:53:35] <%Keyd00d> NICE
[1:53:36] <Joey1995456> Revengence also had the counter, that was buffed on the highest difficulty.
[1:53:36] <gustavozxd> you can use items in DMC games before 5, and DT heals a lot

[1:55:30] <Vekxun> I'm surprised by the difficulty spike going up just the 1 mode.
[1:55:34] <%valkuma> is that the best sword combo you can do to him?
[1:55:35] <PlumpPotatoRump> do enemies and bossew get new moves in DmD?
[1:55:37] <Onamar> My first win on Vergil 4 took me like an hour, I feel like they changed some things specifically to fuck with you if you're used to Vergil 3.
[1:55:49] <ThiccSuccLVL99> I mean, Vergil isn't even -that- cool Kappa
[1:55:49] <%QueequegTheater> @dreamfillah Kalina Ann 2 double laser knocks Vergil out of DT
[1:55:51] <%spiritofmojave> you'd think Vergil would know by know Dante's 'just punch the fire' solutions to everything
[1:55:57] <$GoogleyGareth> @dreamfillah If you use the gunslinger laser from the rocket launcher on him when he charges up, he gets staggered out of it.
[1:55:59] <%spiritofmojave> *by now know
[1:56:00] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@StrangeCoincidence) (warning)
[1:56:07] <Valdorick> Vergil + Royal Guard? My god, Woolie would die from the lack of blood going to brain from the HUGE ERECTION
[1:56:09] <zerocruz> They made Vergil super hard and I LOVE IT
[1:56:10] <mechslayer71> @vekxun Cavalier Angelo was the same way. Beat him first try my first play through, took several tries on SoS
[1:56:11] <Zombrocom> Just the normal charged laser or the gunslinger super laser?

[1:57:37] <%ScreamingMeat> @Valdorick Yes

[1:58:01] <+TimeRewinder1> I love this fight I got him to 20% hp like 5x without getting hit and then couldn't figure out a clean strat to beat him
[1:58:01] <%Hasmeister96> so is Vergil gaining health back when he hits you, or is that just the amount he gains back by using his DT?
[1:58:02] <Paradocks23> Royal guard does biggest damage.
[1:58:05] <@SSaryn> But that was Royal Revenge wasn't it?
[1:58:09] <abakkus> SO CLOSE U CAN DO IT

[1:59:31] <$bootysteve> You can also dt out of the cmobos
[1:59:31] <+TimeRewinder1> royal guard really makes this a lot harder because it eats DT if messed up a bit
[1:59:35] <LazyLuca> what's he playing on DMD?
[1:59:36] <+iNotOriginal> gotta switch to swordmaster when you're slicing him in dt
[1:59:36] <dukenux> Gotta be honest. I didn't expect THAT differecne between DH and SOS
[1:59:43] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> I think this might surpass Vergil 3 for me as favorite Vergil fight
[1:59:44] <$ooblagis> Technically, playable Vergil is available RIGHT NOW. He just sucks
[1:59:50] <%ScreamingMeat> Maybe charge up You Sin D.T and save it for the last leg of the fight?

[2:00:02] <RichochetForce> @dukenux Well, the issue is that DH was softened compared to previous games
[2:00:03] <+advoccat> @dukenux till DmD LUL
[2:00:06] <+ItsAGundamu> Isnt his health doubles in DMD?
[2:00:10] <+xx123manxx> DMD is fairly easy they just take 30 minutes to die
[2:00:14] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Just realized the difficult mode is SOS FailFish
[2:00:16] <Paradocks23> Making me want to go play this.
[2:00:18] <dukenux> @RichochetForce oh yeah, i noticed that
[2:00:19] <PlumpPotatoRump> that room with the two furys FUCKED me up for a while
[2:00:30] <+TimeRewinder1> if you can beat it on this you can probably beat it on dmd just the same

[2:00:31] <%Big_Dream> 3 mistakes
[2:00:33] <%QueequegTheater> 2
[2:00:34] <+tkrall36> if you reflect his dagger theres a small chance it could 1 shot him. Happened to me on accident
[2:00:36] <BunnyEmperor> crazy talk
[2:00:36] <%Big_Dream> on dmd
[2:00:40] <$ooblagis> On DMD you'll probably have learned how easy it is to cheese bosses with Faust LUL
[2:00:40] <+TheoTTree> I'm not sure how much of it to attribute to being better at the game but I'm finding DMD for the most part... manageable
[2:00:42] <%Konquerer> apatWrong
[2:00:42] <%sshen> Now hell of hell
[2:00:43] <RichochetForce> @dukenux Yup, the game only started to feel like classic DMC difficulty in the back half for example

[2:01:46] <+ItsAGundamu> I've tried it
[2:01:47] <Shishi1205> That dmg is ludicrous
[2:01:51] <+Captain_Salt_47> that's a lot of damage
[2:01:54] <%laserbeaming> !uptime
[2:01:55] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 1m.
[2:02:07] <%spiritofmojave> because he is
[2:02:07] <Hobbiesoftheshire> Cavalier is a good for air combos when you launch him I find
[2:02:07] <+xx123manxx> That effect is so good
[2:02:09] <+ZeferSenano> Slay all!
[2:02:10] <%0dokuro> Yes

[2:02:18] <Paradocks23> YEAH!
[2:02:18] <%starotter70> Good damage
[2:02:19] <Turyx01> @DaGodKira he uses Swordmaster to break them without stop movement
[2:02:20] <+Exyoh> Oof, that timing
[2:02:21] <BunnyEmperor> Nice DT transition line
[2:02:21] <Sanyle> TIMING
[2:02:22] <RichochetForce> Judgement Cut is a perfect example of satisfying animation work.
[2:02:25] <Ipsenscastle> now he's unmotivated
[2:02:27] <%nameless_majin> JESUS CHRUST apatDab

[2:02:32] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@WaterBoardKickflip) (warning)
[2:02:35] <Floofiie> Balrog flame jump gets rid of all the swords
[2:02:35] <AllenDeadman> NICE
[2:02:37] <+MichelaDare> @MichelaDare is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:02:41] <+Blue256> it's an enemy stand!
[2:02:43] <%0dokuro> For real though that is some tight timing, great job pat
[2:02:51] <zerocruz> Poor Nero
[2:02:54] <%laserbeaming> Hey Pat, you can destroy those swords he puts around you by jumping with Balrog on
[2:02:57] <Floofiie> This SoS or DmD?
[2:02:57] <gustavozxd> the son I don't remember having
[2:02:58] <BunnyEmperor> Vergil the tracksuit dad
[2:02:58] <CuttleCrow> [crazy talk]
[2:03:00] <Flyrant> his stand is too strong even for crazy talk
[2:03:02] <Gruhunchously> This is my REAL son.
[2:03:02] <+HoloToast> Vergil: "I don't care for Gob"
[2:03:04] <Dehlome> imagine if the vergil doppelganger did judgement cuts too
[2:03:05] <%Ion_Laser> @Floofiie SoS
[2:03:06] <OkamiDude15> @Floofiie sos
[2:03:08] <%QueequegTheater> That is nonsense
[2:03:12] <Magnetgear> @floofiie SoS
[2:03:16] <BigDickBazusos> rainstorm also works to get rid of the swords
[2:03:20] <%willjar313> So wait a second, how old is Vergil, and how old is Nero?
[2:03:23] <+LittleRex26> @LittleRex26 is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[2:03:23] <jubejube56> lol that cheeky sword at the end
[2:03:24] <OkamiDude15> @Dehlome it does do them if its alive long enough
[2:03:27] <AlasterAngelo> when the boss style combos you
[2:03:32] <PlumpPotatoRump> nero is 24 i dunno vrrg's age
[2:03:35] <AllenDeadman> NotLikeThis
[2:03:36] <WaxWitch> it's beautiful isn't it? they really did Judgement Cut well here
[2:03:36] <Dehlome> @OkamiDude15 thats freakin spooky
[2:03:36] <Flyrant> lol, pat needs better combos to break vergils guard
[2:03:36] <PlumpPotatoRump> vergils*
[2:03:40] <%0dokuro> Now Vergil will use Daddy Guard
[2:03:40] <AlasterAngelo> @willjar313 Vergil should be 40 like Dante
[2:03:41] <Deano8817> why does vergil simply not also royal guard 🤔
[2:03:44] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Pat's got this HassaanChop
[2:03:51] <Gruhunchously> Coming down to the wire here.
[2:03:51] <CuttleCrow> two bros, just royal guarding
[2:03:55] <stirlingw17> @AlasterAngelo virgil should have a style meter over his head just to taunt you
[2:03:57] <+6695HC> @willjar313 vergil and dante are boomers
[2:03:58] <Floofiie> HE SAID IT
[2:04:08] <+ItsAGundamu> Not in a Million years
[2:04:10] <Aydarkzero> not in a million years!
[2:04:10] <%willjar313> @AlasterAngelo They DO NOT look 40.
[2:04:10] <ThiccSuccLVL99> It's a sure thing
[2:04:11] <%lloyddboy> F
[2:04:11] <Gruhunchously> You WRETCH

[2:04:17] <%ScreamingMeat> Just Gorb alread
[2:04:18] <%RNGbob> @AngriestPat Did you know you can double devil buster Vergil if you have the buster arm equipped on the Nero fight?
[2:04:18] <+wwwwwww1> dante keeps jinxing it
[2:04:18] <Paradocks23> Damn.
[2:04:19] <BunnyEmperor> Doppelganged
[2:04:20] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT
[2:04:20] <Flyrant> is F a rank you can get in this game?
[2:04:21] <%0dokuro> Ye
[2:04:22] <aizt> big oof
[2:04:22] <%bruthabone> use the gunslinger double kalina ann beam while he charges the strafing run to stop it and knock him out of DT
[2:04:26] <$DarkKnightGrave> That was a fast million
[2:04:27] <IminyourBase> where did that million years come from?!?!
[2:04:28] <Ultimatefool> Think Pat can beat this fight? Hopefully in a million years
[2:04:28] <@SSaryn> Dealing with Doppleganger can be rough if you don't got full RG.
[2:04:30] <WaxWitch> funny how Vergil still talks mad shit, but rarely wins LUL
[2:04:30] <ThiccSuccLVL99> A MILLION
[2:04:30] <+xx123manxx> not cheating hard enough with sin dt Kappa
[2:04:31] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:04:31] <%nameless_majin> Fuck you were so close!
[2:04:34] <candidateplays> I groaned so hard
[2:04:35] <%0dokuro> Vergil's Father Guard is too strong
[2:04:36] <+6695HC> vergil uses perfect judgement cut to mow your lawn at 4am
[2:04:39] <Dickbutt_prime> Jesus this fight gives me anxiety.
[2:04:42] <%Mikatonic> just use double kalina ann like a pro
[2:04:43] <%QueequegTheater> Pat, not hear that line? Not in a million years
[2:04:48] <+天使42199> wasnt not in a million years from when DmC donte gets the grey hair wig ?
[2:04:48] <nikkyshef> what difficulty is this?
[2:04:49] <DeebzNutz100> 31245
[2:04:50] <Ipsenscastle> why does nobody know what boomers are? late 40s is gen Xers you clods
[2:04:51] <Aydarkzero> i noticed it right away
[2:04:54] <@SSaryn> @nikkyshef SOS
[2:04:55] <Wan6Saber> little brother? athHM
[2:04:56] <OkamiDude15> @nikkyshef sos
[2:04:57] <BunnyEmperor> why are you not knocking him in the air for combos?
[2:04:57] <Floofiie> Summon swords you mean free DT
[2:04:57] <%QueequegTheater> @天使42199 yes
[2:04:59] <$ESP_ROOT> @天使42199 yes
[2:05:00] <WaxWitch> SoS
[2:05:03] <+天使42199> @QueequegTheater LUL
[2:05:05] <Tha_Mik> BONK
[2:05:06] <nikkyshef> okie
[2:05:08] <Flyrant> sin DT is a risk though since you can't heal in it
[2:05:09] <+天使42199> @ESP_ROOT haha wow LUL
[2:05:10] <%spiritofmojave> SDT does cheese it if you can build up with RG
[2:05:12] <+TimeRewinder1> much better fight when not using sin DT
[2:05:13] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RNGbob) (warning)
[2:05:15] <Flyrant> and Pat needs heals
[2:05:20] <%ECRead> stinky boi
[2:05:21] <stirlingw17> crazy talk immediately activates
[2:05:24] <blackorchidKI2> @Ipsenscastle That's the joooke.
[2:05:36] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat Use round trip to keep Virgil in check, it what I did. I basically made him easy to punish after every move.
[2:05:38] <$ESP_ROOT> you havent taunted him once PepeHands
[2:05:39] <Ipsenscastle> @blackorchidKI2 ah ok
[2:05:44] <+xx123manxx> Fight is really easy when you use phase 1 to fill Sin DT then beat his ass to phase two, Royal release him into phase 3 then pop Sin DT
[2:05:48] <%zeroarturia> Dont let Crazy Talk get in the way
[2:05:48] <+TimeRewinder1> @Flyrant imagine if he put that entire DT bar into sin RN and just kept blocking
[2:05:51] <%Hasmeister96> BTW is this the nearest we're going to get to Dante and Vergil fighting shirtless in the rain on top of a Metal Gear?
[2:05:54] <+TimeRewinder1> @Flyrant fight is over
[2:05:55] <Floofiie> @ DSD doesn't have Round Trip
[2:05:56] <aimlesshealer> Can you not launch him on this difficulty?
[2:06:05] <Tha_Mik> there you go
[2:06:07] <%spiritofmojave> Cavalier is good for keeping him into the air longer
[2:06:10] <%QueequegTheater> @aimlesshealer You can, Pat just doesn't
[2:06:11] <%0dokuro> get that air time
[2:06:12] <RichochetForce> @Hasmeister96 Unfortunately, yes. Woolie is now sad.
[2:06:20] <InfiniteSwagbito> Why does pat not cancel his DT earlier? Seems like a waste
[2:06:20] <Floofiie> @PrinceOfEden DSD don't got round trip
[2:06:21] <%laserbeaming> Don't use stinger to get close!
[2:06:23] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Triggered NotLikeThis
[2:06:25] <BunnyEmperor> @xx123manxx yeah Pat waste the good shit way too early
[2:06:27] <%laserbeaming> Specially not in DT
[2:06:32] <PrinceOfEden> @Floofiie The floating swords, due.
[2:06:34] <PrinceOfEden> dude*
[2:06:34] <$hatesdps> uh oh woolie stream now too?! what do i do???
[2:06:35] <PrinceOfEden> FailFish
[2:06:42] <RichochetForce> @PrinceOfEden The spinning swords is DSD's round trip
[2:06:43] <+6695HC> I don't know why but woolie thinking that they fought in the rain shirtless was the funniest shit to me
[2:06:45] <OneEyeAnimator> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis

[2:06:49] <Flyrant> Woolie streaming too? This is sophie's choice
[2:06:51] <Zombrocom> Which is better
[2:06:53] <Hellarussian> its gonezo
[2:06:53] <+TimeRewinder1> stinger is actually really effective its just a matter of knowing when
[2:06:54] <+noajenkk> did his rg get broken?
[2:06:55] <Tha_Mik> @hatesdps use doppleganger
[2:06:55] <stirlingw17> you used it
[2:06:55] <%starotter70> @hatesdps Tiddy analogy
[2:06:55] <benjiFG> I think you spent it on the summon swords
[2:06:56] <Ner234> @hatesdps Multitwitch ?
[2:06:56] <PrinceOfEden> @RichochetForce That's clearly what I'm talking about.
[2:06:56] <+timblenaut> used it on a SWORD
[2:06:56] <RichochetForce> @6695HC I laughed my ass off when I heard that in the DMC3 LP

[2:07:45] <RichochetForce> @PrinceOfEden Oh, I know. I was confused when the other dude said DSD has no RT
[2:07:48] <%0dokuro> not a good start
[2:07:48] <+Strogg> vergil wasn't having that bullshit laser so he judgement nutted
[2:07:50] <PrinceOfEden> See?
[2:07:53] <PrinceOfEden> Easy to punish
[2:07:55] <%spiritofmojave> give him the gay cowboy hat and you'll win

[2:08:04] <+Dovakhin573> So does vergil say mitivation at all in this fight?

[2:08:09] <Dickbutt_prime> You can do it Pat!
[2:08:14] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Nice
[2:08:15] <+MugenSandan> Pat you should be able to use Rainfall from Gunslinger to get rid of his summon swords when they surround you
[2:08:16] <%Hasmeister96> so at what point does Pat just give in and use a gold orb?
[2:08:17] <%TheFilth> Vergil's SDT lasts a lifetime
[2:08:20] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Not changing music to Vergil Battle #2 cmonBruh

[2:08:26] <%spiritofmojave> @Dovakhin573 He no longer say he's motivated, sadly :c
[2:08:31] <Deano8817> DRIVE A BIKE ON HIS FACE
[2:08:33] <PrinceOfEden> Yep, this is how I cheesed Virgil. LUL
[2:08:38] <OkamiDude15> @Sphincter_Spelunker can you do that? sfhTHINK woopsHmm
[2:08:40] <+mars_driver> Crazy Talk Activate!

[2:08:53] <stirlingw17> @willjar313 stand by me
[2:08:53] <%primax104> SM makes first phase pretty doable
[2:08:53] <%0dokuro> Daddy Guard vs Royal Guard

[2:08:56] <pwnhills> He HATES it!
[2:09:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> No, do it tho
[2:09:02] <%TheFilth> No Dante! Summoned Swords are my thing!
[2:09:02] <RichochetForce> It's almost like Dante is stronger than Vergil. Maybe. Possibly.
[2:09:03] <PrinceOfEden> Yep. Don't judge me for spamming this in DMD. @Noktifer
[2:09:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> PC Mustard Race

[2:09:22] <OkamiDude15> @BunnyEmperor i assumed as much
[2:09:23] <+天使42199> hey if vergil has summon swords dante can use his too
[2:09:26] <PolarBear1071> is this Son of Sparda?
[2:09:27] <zerocruz> Fireworks for Summoned swords Pat!

[2:09:37] <didgereedoodah> HITBOXES
[2:09:39] <InfiniteSwagbito> where's the receipt on that hitbox
[2:09:40] <%Cavumentum> Dante: "Dad said it's my turn to be OP with Summoned Swords"
[2:09:41] <JT137> weird Vergil is weak to summon swords Kappa
[2:09:41] <Tha_Mik> Now Vergil knows how it feels
[2:09:41] <RichochetForce> @Shishi1205 Basically. Dante has stomped this fool into the dirt so often it has broken him mentally.
[2:09:44] <+blacklyon50> MOTIVATED
[2:09:55] <%TheFilth> First my William Blake book, now my summoned swords
[2:10:03] <Shishi1205> He never stops trying tho

[2:10:26] <$NocturneNovember> That's only on Devil Hunter, but still
[2:10:27] <%absolute_weapon> Not weird at all @JT137 It's like a Dragon type, weak to your own moves

[2:11:45] <%sshen> Royal release
[2:11:48] <%TheFilth> @Hasmeister96 lol no
[2:11:48] <RichochetForce> Royal Guard is no joke.
[2:11:51] <%0dokuro> Ma son is not as strong as Futher
[2:11:52] <$ooblagis> @Hasmeister96 Naw, it's just a sword with a motor
[2:11:55] <OkamiDude15> @Hasmeister96 nope its just modified to fuck
[2:11:56] <%Cavumentum> Does the damage boost from balrog's inflame boost the damage on a royal release?
[2:11:56] <+Exyoh> Red Queen is just a cool engine sword. No demons
[2:11:57] <+6695HC> @Hasmeister96 red queen is not a devil arm at all
[2:11:57] <VritraReiRei> then why not do it? 🤔
[2:11:58] <+MstrSwrd> @Hasmeister96 Nope- just a really good sword made to combat demons
[2:11:59] <stirlingw17> @Hasmeister96 no
[2:11:59] <+Dovakhin573> Here I would just kill vergils stand and then dodge
[2:12:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> you can do it you short ginger fuck
[2:12:03] <InfiniteSwagbito> I rocked Balrog/Royal Guard this whole fight, worked out pretty well
[2:12:06] <n0ahjpvd> such jumping

[2:12:22] <DeebzNutz100> Why not use trickster for evasion?
[2:12:23] <+Exyoh> If Nero gets a Red Queen devil arm in the next game (if ever), it'll be ridiculous
[2:12:27] <+xx123manxx> Mom said it's my turn on the summon swords
[2:12:29] <DarthCiDulous> @hasmeister96 no not close, its heavy modified to the point only nero can weild due to demon heritage

[2:15:52] <+MutedOnTwitter> that's a weird way to start off a phone call
[2:15:52] <%MagickBurritoh> creedo
[2:15:55] <dukenux> Kyrie, my Dad is an ASSHOLE, Kyrie!
[2:15:55] <+giogiothethird> KYRIE oh my god i have a dad
[2:15:55] <shotgang86> how the fuck is the phone working my god I love this game
[2:15:56] <Kefkaisnotamused> Ware waaa
[2:15:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> are gonna bone right
[2:15:58] <BunnyEmperor> I'm still bummed that there is no Kyrie model...
[2:15:59] <Dehlome> "The time has come and so have I"
[2:16:02] <CuttleCrow> it was covered in slime, so its ok Kyrie
[2:16:03] <jorgeniev> hey pat are you gonna play seikiro when it comes out?
[2:16:06] <%alexandrecau> credo was bullying the shit out of you
[2:16:06] <@SSaryn> Can I just say, this is the best fight in DMC5?
[2:16:07] <%primax104> this guy kind of looks like young Johnny Yong Bosch
[2:16:09] <%Afterman_> the blood lizards suck ass to fight on dmd
[2:16:11] <Aydarkzero> why doesn't Kyrie have a model? Kappa
[2:16:12] <Tha_Mik> No shut up tho
[2:16:13] <%TheFilth> THERE WAS NO TIME
[2:16:13] <IminyourBase> it's not dumb you're dumb shut up
[2:16:14] <+giogiothethird> dante worse uncle
[2:16:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sparda line is dumb as rocks
[2:16:14] <Valdorick> Finding out that Nero is related to Sparda just makes her yern more.
[2:16:15] <Deano8817> I would totally fucking buy Dante not telling Nero shit though
[2:16:15] <Willfordbrimly> Its not dumb, it's stupid. Stupid awesome.
[2:16:15] <candidateplays> The entire end of the game is real bad, story wise
[2:16:15] <sc0ttch> Its so cringe
[2:16:16] <InfiniteSwagbito> Man I was really looking forward to seeing Kyrie's Thiccness in RE2's engine
[2:16:17] <%laserbeaming> This whole sequence is dumb
[2:16:18] <%0dokuro> Big dumb, but big anime fights so its okay
[2:16:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> so Kyrie is dead right
[2:16:19] <RichochetForce> Yeah, it's some bullshit from a DMC4 novel
[2:16:19] <abakkus> all these dumbass men have hella emotional issues and dont know how to communicate good
[2:16:19] <%Tearonex> No shut up Pat it's gneius
[2:16:19] <+Personified134> credo only coming up NOW is a bit goofy yeah
[2:16:20] <gustavozxd> I'm glad they didn't waste their time modeling Kyrie
[2:16:22] <+Afrobrawler> The phone or the transformation?
[2:16:23] <Hellarussian> no its super good
[2:16:24] <StrangeCoincidence> nero wants a family... since 3 seconds ago
[2:16:25] <alrobot2014> how much contact did dante have with nero post dmc 4?
[2:16:25] <dukenux> I like Kyrie's lowkey them in this, tho
[2:16:26] <+conradical> vergil was dead all this time, wasn't he? even in DMC4? so why would it come up
[2:16:27] <IminyourBase> like shut up tho
[2:16:27] <cinless> what didn't come up?
[2:16:29] <%Ganerumo> Because Dante is a huge coward
[2:16:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> and Nero is a dream
[2:16:29] <+advoccat> kyrie must be Pregnant
[2:16:30] <%starotter70> Dante's just a lazy fuck, ok
[2:16:31] <televisedrevolting> Nero just assumed Dante was his dad and never asked. That's my explanation at least
[2:16:33] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat remember when nero and kyrie didn't even mention credo once after his death in dmc4
[2:16:34] <%primax104> get ready for them SFX
[2:16:36] <dukenux> i mean DMC4 music
[2:16:37] <%enkaisu> what doesn't come up
[2:16:37] <%lloyddboy> MAMORU
[2:16:37] <vindaxxv> they're not the type of people to ask or answer
[2:16:38] <IminyourBase> who come up?!?
[2:16:38] <ThiccSuccLVL99> My action game needs awkward phone conversations!!!! UnSane
[2:16:39] <$Rumbutt> I mean, how is Dante supposed to tell him though? Your dad is my brother and he went to hell and then I killed him...?
[2:16:40] <+AXL808> The Kyrie box
[2:16:41] <%Hasmeister96> @k0tyc it also doesn't help that Kyrie's English VA voiced Orihime, and Nero's Devil Trigger kinda looks like Ulqiorra
[2:16:41] <K0TYC> it felt like mission 20 should have been an entire level leading up to a boss fight ending, not just a boss fight
[2:16:43] <CuttleCrow> 1/8th demon babby
[2:16:44] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Dante didn't want him to know Pat

[2:23:47] <Valdorick> No! He will NTO except his sweet surrender chat! Bad chat!
[2:23:48] <dukenux> Fight with your dad simulator

[2:23:53] <Willfordbrimly> Devil Bringer brings the suplexes
[2:23:56] <Shishi1205> Wait does he not heal while dting?
[2:23:57] <%aivalera> @angriestpat I literally plucked him from the sky on my first try, and then my Xbox fucking crashdd
[2:23:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That was kind of underwhelming

[2:24:25] <+HoloToast> scum of sparda
[2:24:31] <Ipsenscastle> this song is terrible
[2:24:37] <Hydrapissed> Schum
[2:24:38] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> This song is fantastic
[2:24:40] <RichochetForce> @phoenix_games87 Someone modded the game to allow it. It's PAINFUl looking.
[2:24:43] <+tigerfang86> this song owns
[2:24:43] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat When Vergil is in his knockdown state, you'll do more damage to him using 2 Showdowns
[2:24:43] <T_Sasquatch> FUCK YOUUUUU
[2:24:44] <gogoszy> I like that his Sin DT has sheathes on both arms.
[2:24:45] <+GeneralHysterics> FINISHED

[2:24:54] <Saltmeisterr> rip hype

[2:24:55] <phoenix_games87> oh wow really tats crazy
[2:24:55] <+blue_shyguy> this song slaps tho
[2:24:55] <+countgaculatv> This song slaps
[2:24:55] <+Rewrench> the song is missing a lot since hes at low style
[2:24:56] <%ScreamingMeat> SoS Vergil seems easier with Nero
[2:24:56] <Paradocks23> Time to reset.
[2:24:57] <%Nobrev> @Ipsenscastle pat hasn't triggered the full song yet
[2:24:57] <Storm_Samurai> BEST SONG
[2:24:57] <%sshen> Yeah silver bullet is a fantastic song
[2:24:58] <Morning_Asakura> kyrie
[2:24:58] <Pillagius> break the dopelganger's face with devil bringer? It oneshots him
[2:24:58] <+MisterAngryEyes112> On its own the song isn't much but in this fight its fantastic!
[2:24:58] <+Exyoh> If you're good enough, it's a good song
[2:25:00] <%Hasmeister96> how old is Nero meant to be in this game? Just wondering cos of the teen-esqe angst
[2:25:00] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> D-daaaddddy
[2:25:01] <OneEyeAnimator> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:25:02] <BunnyEmperor> GG Vergil won by default
[2:25:03] <Sapphire_Breeze> this song is the best
[2:25:05] <%kenpachi9211> I think I should've counted oh well
[2:25:05] <CurrySauseBandit> Good try
[2:25:05] <Willfordbrimly> I realy wish there was a faster restart option
[2:25:07] <+l3sovikk> Give Daddy a taste of the good shit.
[2:25:07] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Don't waaaake daddy
[2:25:08] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Nero is about 25
[2:25:08] <+JediWomprat> DAAAADDEEEEEY
[2:25:09] <+Strogg> Is it me or is vergil easier with nero than dante. even when i played i only died once
[2:25:11] <AlasterAngelo> LIKE A SILVER BULLET
[2:25:12] <darkvergillll> Daddy gave rekt him
[2:25:12] <phoenix_games87> vergils in 20s
[2:25:17] <K0TYC> @Hasmeister96 20s
[2:25:18] <stirlingw17> i love how they have to tone virgil down in order for nero to fight him
[2:25:19] <+天使42199> nero battle is way easier imo
[2:25:19] <%spiritofmojave> this song slaps like hell, I still prefer Shadow's DMC1 remix tho
[2:25:19] <%FrustratedAF> would ragtime help????
[2:25:22] <%HyperCharge_Sam> Use the Gorbs Kappa
[2:25:25] <+GeneralHysterics> MUDA
[2:25:26] <$ESP_ROOT> that "nero..." kinda hurts FeelsBadMan
[2:25:27] <%FrustratedAF> "what power is this?" TIMESTOP
[2:25:28] <+alphonseisbest> Nero is around 24 -5
[2:25:32] <Aydarkzero> wait then how old is Dante?
[2:25:32] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The best one is still the double DT grab
[2:25:33] <%daisyyyy> Its less of a victory lap now
[2:25:33] <zerocruz> This song sucks and I’ll die on this hill
[2:25:36] <Gruhunchously> *sad violin*
[2:25:40] <+Dovakhin573> Now can you counter buster his helmbreakers?
[2:25:43] <K0TYC> @Aydarkzero like 45 I believe
[2:25:44] <gustavozxd> Nero's fight is supposed to be harder
[2:25:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Dante is like mid 40's
[2:25:45] <phoenix_games87> Dante is supposed to be in 40s i believe
[2:25:46] <%ScreamingMeat> I wish you still got Super Nero for the final boss like in the first run
[2:25:46] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> I will kill you on this hill
[2:25:47] <%sshen> dante is mid 40s
[2:25:47] <T_Sasquatch> did anyone else just use their dt IMMEDIATELY the fight started for the first time ? LUL
[2:25:48] <%TheFilth> @zerocruz then perish
[2:25:49] <+alphonseisbest> @aydarkzero OLD
[2:25:52] <Aydarkzero> thats weird
[2:25:52] <eco419> V BibleThump
[2:25:53] <stirlingw17> was that 3 max acts in a row

[2:25:56] <aimlesshealer> damn dude
[2:25:56] <%MagickBurritoh> wtf
[2:25:57] <CopperTucker> Dante is "old"
[2:25:58] <+GeneralHysterics> I love how lazy vergil is in his summoned swords at the start
[2:26:00] <Zombrocom> Gerbera
[2:26:00] <Saltmeisterr> perish you fool
[2:26:01] <BunnyEmperor> Judged
[2:26:01] <%Niney_Who> ELIMINATE ALL
[2:26:03] <freedomboyz> that is so coool
[2:26:03] <+HoloToast> zerocruz there's dozen of us
[2:26:04] <%AllYouCanYeet> Gerbera
[2:26:04] <CopperTucker> but Nero is a great shitkid
[2:26:05] <Amasepyt> NO DAD NO
[2:26:05] <Onamar> Grab him
[2:26:05] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, RIP
[2:26:06] <Paradocks23> @screamingmeat I think he's easier on every difficulty as Nero. Power and such.
[2:26:09] <zerocruz> No regrets
[2:26:09] <T_Sasquatch> Ive never been hit by that LUL
[2:26:10] <ThiccSuccLVL99> DT > Za Warudo
[2:26:10] <RichochetForce> Yeah, ioritree on YOutube has Super V vs Vergil. V even has a special kill animation against Vergil.
[2:26:12] <+MisterAngryEyes112> oooh nice parry
[2:26:12] <+LeroyOctopus> breakaway can get you out of there, but you don't use that
[2:26:14] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You can stun him out with dt
[2:26:14] <%Skrypto> Skrypto subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Happy January the 75th!!!
[2:26:22] <Willfordbrimly> AAWWWW HELL NAWWWWW
[2:26:22] <spawnzie> So THAT'S what Rawhide is for
[2:26:23] <tri3dgE027> Break Away or Gerbera Spam
[2:26:23] <%aivalera> Or charged bullets
[2:26:30] <IminyourBase> yeee yee lets gooooo
[2:26:33] <fabnanman> Kreygasm
[2:26:33] <+miguelrod777> SICK
[2:26:34] <jorgeniev> attacking him
[2:26:35] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Oh so it automatically starts up after the first buster
[2:26:36] <OneEyeAnimator> the music sync
[2:26:37] <RichochetForce> I'm almost certain Vergil will be an enemy in Bloody Palace or something. You don't spend money animating something no one will ever see.
[2:26:38] <Rubyeyed> punchline is best here imo, stays on Vergil all time, ez stun and cheap dmg
[2:26:38] <+GeneralHysterics> FUCK YOU
[2:26:39] <%starotter70> FUCK YOU
[2:26:41] <ne_zha> FUCK YOU
[2:26:42] <abakkus> FUCK YOU
[2:26:42] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @RichochetForce Bloody Palace hold over, probably
[2:26:42] <errasos> fuck you!
[2:26:42] <+skylerpilot> Nero fight is still easier in SoS not sure about DmD yet as im still on teh dante v virgil fight on DmD but its just not free like it is on Devil Hunter. You no longer have infinite DT on the higher difficulties during the fight
[2:26:44] <Saltmeisterr> FUCK YOU
[2:26:44] <$ESP_ROOT> FUCK YOU
[2:26:44] <BunnyEmperor> PULL MY FUCK YOU
[2:26:47] <%Ahack13> I don't know about SoS because I haven't gotten there yet. But I found this fight to be WAY easier than the Dante one on Devil Hunter.
[2:26:48] <AlasterAngelo> FUCK YOU
[2:26:51] <+xx123manxx> ANGERY TRIGGER
[2:26:51] <ThiccSuccLVL99> FUCK TRIGGER

[2:26:55] <%Skrypto> WHOS FUCKING YOU?
[2:26:58] <abakkus> nero's had enough of this bullshit
[2:26:59] <RichochetForce> @Sphincter_Spelunker Almost certainly. Just like earning Vergil's DMC3 color
[2:27:02] <T_Sasquatch> Never has there ever been a time to say fuck you so appropriately
[2:27:03] <chikensandwich> Triple jump is good to get out of judgement cut end
[2:27:04] <WaxWitch> is the OST out yet?
[2:27:04] <bleugh> FUCK YOU! nyannAngry
[2:27:05] <KnightAsteran> this SOS or DMD?
[2:27:07] <gustavozxd> I'll buy the PC version if I can mod that fuck you to play every time you turn DT on with Nero
[2:27:07] <Hellarussian> Nero got his DT by being really angry?
[2:27:08] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @skylerpilot still easier on DMD, but it's a fun fight
[2:27:08] <%Hasmeister96> @sphincter_spelunker fair enough I guess
[2:27:13] <%spiritofmojave> @Ahack13 Yep, it's definitely meant to be a victory lap with the DT on the lower difficulties
[2:27:14] <%Big_Dream> Hey nero yes vergil i fucked your mom
[2:27:14] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Ahack13 You'd be correct, it was kind of a victory run
[2:27:16] <%Skrypto> 5th Jesus?
[2:27:23] <didgereedoodah> Did virgil just Shodown?
[2:27:25] <%TheFilth> I love how they gave him DMC4SE combos
[2:27:25] <42nfl19> BOTH
[2:27:26] <InfiniteSwagbito> YEYEYE HE DID MY ADVICE
[2:27:28] <silverira> I will beat dad!!!!!!!
[2:27:29] <derekwst3> make him say jackpot
[2:27:29] <+GeneralHysterics> OH HE DID IT
[2:27:30] <+天使42199> yeah I just beat it on devil hunter today. Vergil fight with Dante was the first I died in the whole game LUL nero v vergil was a victory lap imo
[2:27:32] <TakesGuts> this fight on DMD is legit to S rank
[2:27:34] <$Zairthos> Pat your hardest!
[2:27:35] <+timblenaut> SHODOWN

[2:27:40] <gustavozxd> massive failure sadness
[2:27:42] <$DarkKnightGrave> BALLER
[2:27:47] <+conradical> next time you stun him, high roller him into the air then grab him
[2:27:50] <$ESP_ROOT> you wont get it
[2:27:50] <0rond> why is he not using any devil breakers?
[2:27:50] <+Punisher7771> beat his ass
[2:27:52] <%Konquerer> prepare to get hugged
[2:27:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> DT Buster?

[2:28:06] <T_Sasquatch> ohhhhhh DDT
[2:28:06] <Malziel> PogChamp
[2:28:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> well then
[2:28:07] <Onamar> if you buster twice while you're in DT you can grab Doppel and Vergil at the same time and smash their heads together. It does a shitton of damage
[2:28:08] <%Tearonex> DT DDT
[2:28:10] <gustavozxd> if you want damage use the buster arm
[2:28:10] <+miguelrod777> NICE
[2:28:11] <BunnyEmperor> Existence suplex

[2:28:13] <deathsmions1> BRAINUBUSTER
[2:28:14] <Saltmeisterr> WAHOO
[2:28:14] <T_Sasquatch> HE NEARLY BROKE
[2:28:15] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You can stun him in dt form with reloaded bullets
[2:28:16] <%Ahack13> @TheSpiritof2277 @InfiniteSwagbito Yeah thats what I kinda figured. Looking forward to the real fight of it when I get there lol.
[2:28:18] <T_Sasquatch> him in HALF JR
[2:28:20] <+GeneralHysterics> He's still probably dead, lol
[2:28:21] <RichochetForce> @KnightAsteran Same. I think it's because Nero has WAY less options than Dante. He's super limited
[2:28:27] <Deano8817> so should we be worried if vergil calls his own son scum?
[2:28:36] <+l3sovikk> monkaS
[2:28:44] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat So yeah just Showdown into Grab and there goes his health lol
[2:28:47] <ThiccSuccLVL99> F
[2:28:48] <%Skrypto> F
[2:28:48] <%NWR_James> Wait, is he still fighting the same fight?
[2:28:49] <+GeneralHysterics> rekt
[2:28:50] <%MagickBurritoh> Don't be a hero Pat, just use a GORB
[2:28:50] <+miguelrod777> ANIME BATTLE
[2:28:50] <+天使42199> @Deano8817 Shcum is just a term of endearment for his family
[2:28:50] <shevan123> always so close
[2:28:51] <reiju_22> whiff punish
[2:28:52] <%arancet> @AngriestPat so then... how did V/Vergil know about Nero to call him in in the first place when he had no idea he was his son?
[2:28:53] <%starotter70> Close
[2:28:53] <AllenDeadman> rip

[2:28:58] <@SSaryn> Yeah SoS isnt a victory lap anymore.
[2:28:58] <+xx123manxx> all that damage that could be avoided if you just break the swords
[2:28:58] <%ThirdWelles> @AngriestPat Rawhide the summon swords

[2:29:00] <0rond> @AngriestPat are you not using any breakers?
[2:29:01] <%aivalera> It requires two or three shots @angriestpat
[2:29:02] <+天使42199> his brother is shcum his son is shcum his mother might be shcum too
[2:29:02] <%dreamfillah> I hear the vocals with this fight so rarely, is it htat hard to S-rank
[2:29:03] <AlasterAngelo> this is the victory lap round Pat
[2:29:03] <RichochetForce> @NWR_James No, this is Nero v Vergil. He was fighting as Dante before.
[2:29:03] <CuttleCrow> Pat's thinkin bout those gorb
[2:29:05] <candidateplays> Buy some Busters
[2:29:05] <+Dovakhin573> Raw Lv1
[2:29:05] <+Razhork> It feels like Dante is better equipped to deal with some of Vergil's attks versus Nero
[2:29:06] <%MagickBurritoh> COWARD OUT YOU HERO
[2:29:06] <phoenix_games87> maybe use rawhilde to get rid of those robs
[2:29:08] <+MisterAngryEyes112> After Dante, fighting Vergil with Nero is really damn limiting
[2:29:10] <%Skrypto> Im sweating after that
[2:29:11] <CopperTucker> the SHADOW REMAINS CAST
[2:29:13] <%HyperCharge_Sam> all those gorbs tho LUL
[2:29:14] <BunnyEmperor> You're not worthy as my SON.
[2:29:15] <Megapikman132> @arancet He met his as V
[2:29:17] <Ids560> this is clearly the time for Sweet surrender
[2:29:20] <%Tearonex> These last two fights are great
[2:29:20] <Jane_Lo> Nero... FeelsBadMan
[2:29:21] <Megapikman132> *Him
[2:29:21] <TakesGuts> how do you do the double buster on vergil and the doppelganger?
[2:29:22] <RichochetForce> @Razhork Absolutely, Dante knows how to deal with his douchebag brother.
[2:29:29] <%TournamentArc> beat his ass
[2:29:31] <PsychoFlash1> @CopperTucker just got some PTSD here LUL
[2:29:31] <+keksisblyat> Ye I think you can just swing at the summon swords around you and they’ll break
[2:29:32] <%Big_Dream> i find nero has an easier time but that just me i guess
[2:29:36] <%Noahccountingfortaste> is rawhide recommended here? I always use Gerbera
[2:29:37] <Onamar> @TakesGuts When he sends out Doppel to try and dodge a grab just DT and hit Buster again
[2:29:38] <+Bupkis7> At least the music is good
[2:29:38] <+JediWomprat> 🎻 BibleThump 🎻
[2:29:38] <gustavozxd> Nero has infinite DT the first time in this fight and dudes still failed LUL
[2:29:39] <InfiniteSwagbito> Lol use THE WORLD on Vergil
[2:29:40] <%spiritofmojave> atleast you have exceed and grapple to add to combos with Nero compared to Dante on this difficulty
[2:29:41] <stirlingw17> za worldo!
[2:29:41] <%Kaask> Kaask subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:29:42] <Zombrocom> Did he just break ragtime?
[2:29:42] <%TheFilth> Vergil don't give a fuck
[2:29:45] <%MagickBurritoh> oh wow ragtime doesn't work on him
[2:29:45] <Hellarussian> wow
[2:29:47] <$ESP_ROOT> PepeHands 🎻
[2:29:48] <AlasterAngelo> did he just cut through time
[2:29:49] <$cureneckbeard> woolie is doing the blue/purple thing again

[2:29:51] <eco419> reset
[2:29:51] <0rond> yeah he just straight up cancels non breakage rag time

[2:30:02] <+Razhork> FUCK YOU
[2:30:04] <Valdorick> Is Vergil stronger than time!? Can Vergil solo Jiren!?
[2:30:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> demon butt
[2:30:06] <TakesGuts> @Onamar ty
[2:30:13] <KnightAsteran> @noahccountingfortaste rawhide for parry, gerbera for dodge, so do you want to trick or RG
[2:30:15] <Megapikman132> It happens in the Novel, yeah.
[2:30:16] <+noajenkk> this song is such a banger. was listening to it while running today
[2:30:17] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You can also reflect his summon sword with your sword, it gives you a free combo
[2:30:18] <silverira> PULL MY F&*% TRIGGER
[2:30:19] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Nice
[2:30:21] <%starotter70> Whew
[2:30:23] <+GeneralHysterics> cutting it close there
[2:30:27] <%rubbishbinge> Vergil is technically El Hermano
[2:30:42] <%SaltyDongs> big number
[2:30:43] <+advoccat> LUL
[2:30:45] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @KnightAsteran perfect analogy, makes total sense since I'm a trickster coward
[2:30:46] <%TheFilth> the Doppleganger can be one-shot by snatch and then a buster
[2:30:48] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat is virgil confirmed yet?
[2:30:50] <+deemans> If you double snatch virgil and the doppleganger you can do a double buster
[2:30:51] <CuttleCrow> what buttons does pat have breaker and bringer on?
[2:30:52] <%Ahack13> Can we just talk about how insane Virgil is by fighting both Dante and Nero back-to-back?
[2:30:53] <+l3sovikk> Does Vergil technically have a Stand?
[2:30:58] <phoenix_games87> i think his sin devil is going to be his urizen form
[2:31:02] <InfiniteSwagbito> @rubbishbinge So what you're telling me here, is that I'm looking at Nero Blanco
[2:31:04] <+deemans> You knock their heads together like cartoon characters
[2:31:12] <Zombrocom> Shoulda dted first
[2:31:13] <Morning_Asakura> ahhh dt
[2:31:13] <AlasterAngelo> @phoenix_games87 the thing he's using right now is his Sin DT
[2:31:14] <gustavozxd> damn
[2:31:17] <InfiniteSwagbito> @phoenix_games87 He's already in Sin DT.
[2:31:20] <KnightAsteran> Vergil uses his Sin DT when he starts flying doesn't he?
[2:31:20] <ThiccSuccLVL99> ACCEPT ME FATHER
[2:31:21] <%arancet> @stirlingw17 not officially confirmed, but data mine confirmed...
[2:31:22] <BunnyEmperor> His Sin is Doppelganger
[2:31:23] <%Skrypto> Choppy CHOPPY
[2:31:23] <shevan123> oh fucking YES thats good
[2:31:28] <RichochetForce> @phoenix_games87 No way, he'd be unusable in many story maps if that was the case.
[2:31:33] <InfiniteSwagbito> @KnightAsteran Nah he just charges up and opens the wings
[2:31:34] <stirlingw17> @arancet the hype is fucking real
[2:31:37] <mechslayer71> Shoulda dt’d first, it would slammed hen together
[2:31:39] <+Tonku_the_Red> Hey @AngriestPat , Woolie REALLY needs you to calibrate his TV. His colors are WAY screwed up!
[2:31:44] <+noajenkk> LUL
[2:31:45] <%Skrypto> RIP
[2:31:45] <+GeneralHysterics> sad
[2:31:46] <KingGuthorm> LUL
[2:31:49] <Zombrocom> Virgil is only uses SinDT this fight, you can see his normal DT in the model viewer
[2:31:50] <Hellarussian> BIG miss
[2:31:50] <BunnyEmperor> really LUL
[2:31:50] <Kefkaisnotamused> Owie
[2:31:52] <%TournamentArc> get him now!!!
[2:31:55] <RichochetForce> @Tonku_the_Red Is his gamma super dark like in RE?
[2:31:56] <Angry_Ev1L> Vergil is always in SIn DT in this fight
[2:31:58] <InfiniteSwagbito> The Summon Sword disrespect
[2:32:00] <%starotter70> In the bag
[2:32:03] <Valdorick> Nero Blanco did kill el padre grande.
[2:32:04] <Angry_Ev1L> He has usual D Tart in the gallery
[2:32:05] <%spiritofmojave> if only Nero had RG
[2:32:05] <%daisyyyy> Ijust realized its the church boy who swears
[2:32:07] <+wal__rus> monkaS
[2:32:07] <+xx123manxx> Just break the swords NotLikeThis
[2:32:08] <0rond> @AngriestPat brign a charged buster arm when he is first knocked down, you gotta see how much damage that does
[2:32:08] <abakkus> one drop always spirals rip
[2:32:10] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Wait did you just duck under that LUL
[2:32:10] <+noajenkk> not even worth trying to attack DT vergil
[2:32:12] <ThiccSuccLVL99> Just kill Vergil already Pat, it's a sure thing
[2:32:12] <+GeneralHysterics> big dead
[2:32:13] <%Noahccountingfortaste> I hate that I'm too late for the easy mode jokes
[2:32:15] <%patman22897> Do combo
[2:32:15] <n0ahjpvd> this aint it chief
[2:32:16] <%Skrypto> ErMaGerd
[2:32:16] <Kefkaisnotamused> No gerbera?
[2:32:17] <KnightAsteran> yeah Vergil got his Sin DT when he fused with V
[2:32:22] <+fatal_penguin_> @AngriestPat We need you on Woolie's stream to calibrate his shit tv. GHELP
[2:32:25] <%Nobrev> aww you didn't get the unique double grab that activates the lyrics @AngriestPat
[2:32:27] <+wal__rus> FeelsBadMan
[2:32:27] <Varanoo> Pat you need to calibrate Woolies TV it's BAD, really bad, he needs your help dude @AngriestPat
[2:32:28] <+advoccat> buy arms
[2:32:29] <%battlepope99> why is pat refusing to just use a gold orb?
[2:32:29] <arisenpai> Don't give up dead weight!
[2:32:29] <%ThirdWelles> Rawhide or Gerbera the summon swords circling you @AngriestPat
[2:32:31] <Damashi_The_Kaotic> t is the difference between the two gerberas?
[2:32:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Sin DT is from the fruit
[2:32:32] <InfiniteSwagbito> @KnightAsteran I'm sure the fruit had something to do with it too
[2:32:37] <Angry_Ev1L> @AngriestPat Woolie just discovered that his TV is fucked and not elgato changing colros LUL
[2:32:37] <+天使42199> @battlepope99 pride
[2:32:40] <%FrustratedAF> woolie's tv has the bad colors
[2:32:43] <pshuuu> its perfectly being calibrated
[2:32:44] <+JediWomprat> Fuck gorbs
[2:32:48] <%FrustratedAF> needs calibrated Jebaited
[2:32:51] <+fatal_penguin_> @AngriestPat It's colours are fucked
[2:32:51] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> apatHoldon
[2:32:52] <GyroBrando> it has a line
[2:32:53] <Valdorick> Woolie is doing Deamon X Machina!?
[2:32:56] <InfiniteSwagbito> I think the Fruit gave him the SDT, and Doppelganger was from V
[2:32:56] <RichochetForce> Yes
[2:32:58] <$MightyMaxT> So, that means Vergil HAS to be playable right? No way they'd model his regular DT if they weren't gonna use it at all
[2:33:00] <+noajenkk> whoa what
[2:33:00] <Mrthepastyrider> if dante is surfer grandpa cool, and nero is punk cool, is vergil weeb cool?
[2:33:01] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Puts Vergil on the same ground as Dante's new Sparda. Like Sparda vs Mundus
[2:33:01] <%FrustratedAF> @Valdorick yes yes
[2:33:02] <RichochetForce> Woolie vs Machina
[2:33:03] <KnightAsteran> @infiniteswagbito why not both rooShrug
[2:33:03] <$DarkKnightGrave> colors are fucked
[2:33:04] <+noajenkk> did you parry that?
[2:33:09] <+MisterAngryEyes112> yep gerbera can do that
[2:33:12] <+noajenkk> dope
[2:33:19] <Pillagius> @noajenkk you can parry summon swords yea :)
[2:33:20] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @Mrthepastyrider I'm hoping you unlock him by beating BP as V or something
[2:33:24] <+Tonku_the_Red> Woolie thinks his El Gato is messing with his colors, so he posted a screenshot to Twitter and Twitch told his they're the same as the stream.
[2:33:25] <%ShaneWhite> What’s up, What I missed?
[2:33:26] <%starotter70> Woolie having that color problem again?
[2:33:26] <+noajenkk> FUCK YOU
[2:33:29] <+noajenkk> gonna try that out @Pillagius
[2:33:31] <InfiniteSwagbito> @KnightAsteran Fruit feels like a power boost, refusion with V feels like a technique boost
[2:33:33] <Gruhunchously> Fuck YOOOUUUUU
[2:33:39] <reiju_22> SourPls
[2:33:40] <+wal__rus> multitwitching pat and woolie PogChamp
[2:33:42] <+asperger_mode> HELL NO
[2:33:45] <%aivalera> @angriestpat You can shoot him out his attacks if you side roll and shoot.
[2:33:45] <$Zairthos> son of sperda
[2:33:45] <+noajenkk> i cant believe nero made the DmC "fuck you" cool
[2:33:48] <+noajenkk> actually i can
[2:33:49] <Kefkaisnotamused> Faka me? No, faka YOU
[2:33:49] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Mrthepastyrider Prep with weeb fetishes
[2:33:49] <Deano8817> gotta s rank vergil for the chorus though
[2:33:50] <aimlesshealer> It's awesome if you DT when he stabs you iirc
[2:33:55] <Mrthepastyrider> Nothing Personnel kid
[2:34:03] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Nero going 'Fuck you' has some serious emotional weight behind it tho
[2:34:06] <DynamicIntrigue> Was Vergil wincing from the Summoned swords during that grab?
[2:34:07] <$ESP_ROOT> almost bungled that
[2:34:09] <$MightyMaxT> I think my biggest complaint about Vergil
[2:34:12] <InfiniteSwagbito> LOL
[2:34:21] <+noajenkk> good timing!
[2:34:22] <T_Sasquatch> both you fucking asshole
[2:34:25] <%starotter70> Nice
[2:34:25] <KnightAsteran> @infiniteswagbito either way, he couldn't actually use Sin DT until he fused with V
[2:34:27] <RichochetForce> @Unlimited_Coffee_Works Props to JYB for having the emotional range and chops to actually sell that line
[2:34:27] <+MisterAngryEyes112> gerbera jump breaks the swords! Didn't know that
[2:34:28] <DrkJP520> Wat
[2:34:30] <InfiniteSwagbito> If you let the animation ride Vergil says it's past your bedtime
[2:34:30] <Graxe_> Getting DT Buster on DT Vergil also gets you the lyrics. And it's easier than getting S.
[2:34:31] <+kraajkase> best line in the game
[2:34:41] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat You can snatch the doppelganger
[2:34:43] <Pillagius> @noajenkk IMHO good efficiency - you miss, then you take a little damage, you hit and you cause nice damage to Vergil and open for further beating
[2:34:45] <DagetStreams> There's something viscerally satisfying about Nero calling his dad a fucking asshole
[2:34:48] <$MightyMaxT> I think my biggest complaint about Vergil's look is that he doesn't have the tuft hanging down. It just looks off all slicked back
[2:34:53] <PrinceOfEden> @InfiniteSwagbito And Dante's is "Just like old times"
[2:34:54] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @Graxe_ oh... that explains how I heard them on DMD
[2:35:01] <InfiniteSwagbito> @DagetStreams It's because it was well earned
[2:35:05] <Analogflame> if u snatch the doppleganger and vergil at same time u get the sick secret song
[2:35:06] <%FrustratedAF> don't forget to max act the riding high Kappa
[2:35:08] <%aivalera> @angriestpat Shooting clears out all the summons sword as well when they surround you.
[2:35:11] <Pookiedaexzile> Yo you know Woolie fucked up his TV right
[2:35:13] <Kefkaisnotamused> Were doing so well last game. :/
[2:35:18] <%spiritofmojave> YOU DID IT
[2:35:18] <+noajenkk> i can see that, sure @Pillagius
[2:35:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> HE DID IT

[2:37:12] <aimlesshealer> @PrinceOfEden Suffer (Cerberus theme from DMC3) is easily the best!
[2:37:13] <KarakuriBro> Pogchamp
[2:37:16] <+天使42199> POP THE GORB
[2:37:17] <%0dokuro> Vergil just standing in the background XD

[2:37:18] <+MisterAngryEyes112> You fool!
[2:37:19] <InfiniteSwagbito> Oh he talking shit to you
[2:37:20] <+TheQButton> Progress.
[2:37:21] <Willfordbrimly> Look at Vergil posing for the death cam
[2:37:23] <%brickwall35> that wasn't very BANG BANG BANG of you
[2:37:23] <shotgang86> YOU FOOL
[2:37:25] <gustavozxd> @t_sasquatch heaven or hell, I'm talking about hell and hell
[2:37:26] <CurrySauseBandit> That's a sick shot of virgi behind ya though
[2:37:27] <Willfordbrimly> He did the dame thing in my game
[2:37:27] <%TheFilth> yeah a buster one-shots it
[2:37:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Foolishness
[2:37:29] <RichochetForce> @aimlesshealer It's wild how good Cerberus' theme is for being the first goddamn boss.
[2:37:30] <Paradocks23> Do it with honor.
[2:37:30] <PrinceOfEden> @aimlesshealer Ningen, don't make me cut you. lucidM1 lucidM2
[2:37:36] <Vasendak> woah.. how do you get both with the devil bringer?
[2:37:36] <InfiniteSwagbito> @AngriestPat Snatch the clone/Grab is usually an instakill
[2:37:36] <+ombyes> ombyes subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:37:36] <spawnzie> Air buster is a safe way to kill Doppleganger instantly
[2:37:37] <Graxe_> I like how Vergil is scripted go out of DT and teleport near you just to pose at you lose screen.
[2:37:39] <darcfowler1995> Don’t feel too bad Pat this shit is fucking impressive because of my Parkinson’s I can’t do hardly any of that shit when it comes to combos
[2:37:40] <%Big_Dream> Pull my devil trigger
[2:37:44] <%ShaneWhite> What I missed
[2:37:44] <RichochetForce> That's like getting One Winged Angel on the Guard Scorpion in FF7
[2:37:45] <%CappuccinoGuil> Vergil must be proud of his boy when he suddenly does Maximum Bet
[2:37:53] <Gruhunchously> I really like how it starts with the sad violin
[2:37:54] <%thewildzubat> god i love the slow down
[2:37:57] <DeebzNutz100> Virgil owes back child support
[2:37:59] <%Noahccountingfortaste> I'm behind, guys. This is a DMD run?
[2:38:01] <degamk619> Doppelganger can’t block so you can snatch and buster it
[2:38:05] <+TheoTTree> My favourite song in this game is Cavaliere Angelo's
[2:38:05] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> SoS
[2:38:06] <Gruhunchously> Should have used protection
[2:38:06] <%spiritofmojave> SoS actually
[2:38:07] <PrinceOfEden> SoS @Noahccountingfortaste
[2:38:08] <$ooblagis> SoS run
[2:38:09] <%Noahccountingfortaste> oh
[2:38:12] <CurrySauseBandit> Nero why is your Dad so god danm anime?
[2:38:13] <RichochetForce> @Gruhunchously Yeah, it's a nice contrast.
[2:38:14] <%aivalera> @noahccountingfortaste No, son of sparde
[2:38:23] <T_Sasquatch> @gustavozxd I mean in general , if its just a one hit dead (im not sure which mode it is), could you just shoot them
[2:38:25] <Pookiedaexzile> Quick Question, Who Cheeks did Vergil Clap to make Nero...and Why shouldn't it be Lucia
[2:38:26] <%TheFilth> god I wish drop kicking Vergil did something special
[2:38:31] <%Noahccountingfortaste> thanks for the replies
[2:38:38] <Gruhunchously> No YOU
[2:38:38] <+AXL808> "Why don't you love me, Daddy!?"
[2:38:47] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Lucia was nowhere near Fortuna
[2:38:53] <$ooblagis> @AngriestPat You can DT just for a moment during Buster animations, and if you
[2:38:53] <Onamar> Ooooh I see you don't get infinite DT in SoS
[2:39:04] <KnightAsteran> why did pat only have 1 arm?
[2:39:04] <aimlesshealer> Vergil seems very happy to find out he has a son... in his own way
[2:39:07] <$ooblagis> @AngriestPat You can DT just for a moment during Buster animations, and if you're DTed during the damage, it's gets boosted
[2:39:13] <Deano8817> FUCK YOU
[2:39:15] <Gruhunchously> "What did I ever do to you?" "You were born"
[2:39:15] <KingGuthorm> FUCK YOU honakoRage
[2:39:16] <PrinceOfEden> @KnightAsteran Vergil broke his others LUL
[2:39:17] <%Ahack13> So there was that data showing that Virgil might be playable along with the Bloody Palace release right? What do people think the odds of him coming out that soon are?
[2:39:18] <+天使42199> FUCK YOU SourPls
[2:39:19] <AlasterAngelo> FUCK YOU
[2:39:23] <+ChipZafari> FUCK YOU SourPls
[2:39:23] <%alexandrecau> nero's mom ishinted at being a prostitute
[2:39:26] <+chimaera24> @Onamar You only get infinite DT on your first runthrough
[2:39:27] <+AXL808> what difficulty is this that Pat has retried several times?
[2:39:27] <OneEyeAnimator> FUCK YOU
[2:39:34] <T_Sasquatch> also can someone please explain why the fuck vergil needs to constantly sheath and unsheath his katana ??
[2:39:34] <%starotter70> FUCK YOU take me seriously!
[2:39:37] <+6695HC> @Onamar you only get the super nero costume the first time you do that mission
[2:39:38] <%Ion_Laser> @AXL808 son of sparda
[2:39:40] <DeebzNutz100> This is how Nephilim play catch with thier sons
[2:39:43] <AlasterAngelo> @T_Sasquatch BECAUSE IT'S COOL
[2:39:44] <gustavozxd> V in hell and hell is fucking laame
[2:39:48] <aizt> human Kappa
[2:39:48] <KnightAsteran> @princeofeden do you not get them back after retry?
[2:39:49] <+xx123manxx> need to be DT
[2:39:55] <RichochetForce> @gustavozxd It's AGONY
[2:39:55] <Pookiedaexzile> @Sphincter_Spelunker Why would you put the baby close to you if you're grieving the loss, also our boy Ver is 1 jacket away from a sweet Dante cosplay
[2:39:56] <+天使42199> So Vergil needed to fuck ? so he banged a rando prostitute ?
[2:39:56] <%Nobrev> you need to be in DT for the double grab I think @AngriestPat
[2:40:01] <Onamar> You need to DT to grab both
[2:40:03] <+noajenkk> LUL
[2:40:03] <CuttleCrow> his head is a V
[2:40:04] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[2:40:05] <DrkJP520> You can interrupt him by shooting him in the air after he blocks you strike
[2:40:06] <+misterfistor> you need devil trigger to do the double snatch @AngriestPat
[2:40:06] <%Big_Dream> so nero has full demon regen powers now like dante and vergil
[2:40:07] <+TheoTTree> It's fucking cool
[2:40:07] <PrinceOfEden> @KnightAsteran Nope, can speak from experience. (DMD mode NotLikeThis )
[2:40:08] <%spiritofmojave> @Ahack13 Yeah his moveset, DT and everything are all there--and people Cheatengined the data to play as him sorta. I'd say pretty likely
[2:40:08] <LiquidMathew> Such is the power of the demon fruit
[2:40:09] <InfiniteSwagbito> He's made of Twin Snakes cutscenes
[2:40:09] <EVA_Unit02> Vergil is Ingenium LUL
[2:40:10] <mayorrev> i cant believe vergil FUCKS
[2:40:11] <lols_royce> he's actually valstrax
[2:40:11] <DeebzNutz100> Jet Set May Cry
[2:40:12] <%TheFilth> he's fuelled by motivation
[2:40:13] <beepleks> valstrax cosplay
[2:40:15] <aimlesshealer> Is that why he's so sexy? Kappa
[2:40:16] <%starotter70> Does that mean he can melt steel beams?
[2:40:16] <limeyprick> kinda like jugo
[2:40:16] <RichochetForce> The jet engine blades is actually Yamato's true form.
[2:40:16] <+Exyoh> The horns are so stupid, I love it
[2:40:17] <spawnzie> And has a big ol V on his chest
[2:40:18] <$MightyMaxT> Yamato can melt steel beams
[2:40:18] <KingGuthorm> PogChamp
[2:40:20] <dukenux> Can't believe Vergil turns into Ace Combat
[2:40:21] <Rexenexus> This Devil propels itself in the air by PURE MOTIVATION alone
[2:40:21] <+noajenkk> SourPls
[2:40:22] <Gorgodrn> This is the best fucking grab
[2:40:24] <Saltmeisterr> motherfucker gotta ZOOM
[2:40:26] <Paradocks23> Vergil is Starscream?
[2:40:29] <+AXL808> Powered by DETERMINATION
[2:40:29] <Plague_bagel> vergils just that one monster from monster hunter xx
[2:40:30] <chikensandwich> cause he is fast
[2:40:30] <+Shadicara> Vergil is the Virgilmobile now PogChamp
[2:40:33] <%Typhaeon> That's like the Impaler
[2:40:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Pookiedaexzile ? cmonBruh
[2:40:34] <PrinceOfEden> @Gorgodrn Fury buster says hi
[2:40:36] <%aivalera> Man, you’re nailing all of those grabs
[2:40:36] <jubejube56> It is basically the same grab he does against the angelos
[2:40:40] <%alexandrecau> @AngriestPat vergil is a motor engine because his son has a reving sword
[2:40:40] <dukenux> VergilWING
[2:40:41] <+noajenkk> is gerbera good for getting rid of spiral swords?
[2:40:43] <$NocturneNovember> Dante likes motorcycles, Vergil loves jets
[2:40:43] <+noajenkk> chat?
[2:40:44] <Gruhunchously> Alright, I acknowledge that you exist, now will you die already!?
[2:40:47] <Gorgodrn> @PrinceOfEden it's great too
[2:40:50] <OkoPoko> @T_Sasquatch I kind of see it as a bait tactic. To make enemies think he's dropping his guard.
[2:40:51] <+Dovakhin573> Damn that Marvel Hitbox
[2:40:52] <%Makototruth> I guess it makes sense for Nero to do wrestling moves because he is Cody Rhodes
[2:40:53] <SchroedingersFerret> Gib child support pls
[2:40:58] <+GeneralHysterics> big dumb wrestling moves getting into my video games is the best. See GoW stranger fight and half the stuff nero does
[2:40:59] <+epinefrain> Cody Rhodes should make this his gimmick
[2:41:09] <+noajenkk> but he loves his dad
[2:41:12] <%starotter70> @NocturneNovember I always thought Vergil was more of a car guy
[2:41:12] <Kefkaisnotamused> I acknowledge you exist.. as a corpse.
[2:41:13] <KnightAsteran> @princeofeden I'm only on M17 on SOS and I've only really died as Dante so I guess I just never noticed
[2:41:13] <+HoloToast> Father kills son as 90's eurobeat plays in the distance
[2:41:15] <$NocturneNovember> Cody's already Geese Howard
[2:41:16] <Gorgodrn> I just like the fact that you catch your flying father midair, and slam his asshole face to the ground for being a cunt
[2:41:17] <%Makototruth> That would be money
[2:41:18] <InfiniteSwagbito> "Don't fuck with me!"
[2:41:19] <fegarcia88> It's more of a death valley driver
[2:41:22] <Deano8817> I'm awaiting Kenny Omega's new finisher, Devil Trigger
[2:41:23] <+noajenkk> cody's also cody travers
[2:41:24] <AlasterAngelo> Nero would have a match better than 3 stars tbh
[2:41:27] <Gruhunchously> SCUM
[2:41:28] <+Shadicara> Wonder if Nero will just get more fists in his Sin DT
[2:41:30] <wydamn> "I love my Da-deee!"
[2:41:42] <Gorgodrn> I kinda miss the Shcum
[2:41:43] <InfiniteSwagbito> @Shadicara It just becomes Asura's Wrath at that point and it'd be radical
[2:41:44] <Onamar> @Shadicara Sin DT Nero is just gonna be Asura
[2:41:47] <whobeee> Why is Nero's DT so anime
[2:41:50] <%Makototruth> No I am imagining Vergil saying Dusty Rhodes stuff...
[2:41:52] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat wait for him to take a knee first before buster or any advanced stuff
[2:41:54] <%ScreamingMeat> Sin D.T Nero is basically Asura from Asura's Wrath
[2:41:56] <+Exyoh> Sooner or later, somebody's gonna get full-on oras
[2:42:03] <RichochetForce> @whobeee It looks like something out of Onimusha
[2:42:05] <KnightAsteran> damnit you guys beat me to saying Asura
[2:42:06] <%0dokuro> Baller
[2:42:08] <+天使42199> @Gorgodrn he does say scum in this game but im not sure he says shcum
[2:42:10] <+HoloToast> do we know who's to blame for Nero's DT design?
[2:42:13] <Gruhunchously> You WRETCH
[2:42:16] <Pillagius> Pat just bee line towards Vergil during dimensional slash
[2:42:16] <%Ahack13> Like obviously it wouldn't work for story reasons. But imagine trying to do this fight as V.
[2:42:23] <+JohnnyTubesocks> is this game fun?
[2:42:26] <+TheoTTree> That was hype
[2:42:28] <shevan123> its TIME
[2:42:29] <Gorgodrn> @天使42199 I know, I miss the nostalgic, nasal shcum
[2:42:31] <%TheFilth> no pressure
[2:42:31] <+epinefrain> Damn that baller timing tho
[2:42:33] <brutalbren> This game looks sick I really should play it
[2:42:33] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Think Nero's DT is supposed to show off that he's more human. But yes, very anime
[2:42:34] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Don't miss this!
[2:42:35] <+xx123manxx> either a win or a big fail
[2:42:37] <+Shadicara> This game is very fun
[2:42:38] <+Exyoh> Go Nagai is to blame for this entire franchise
[2:42:38] <aimlesshealer> @JohnnyTubesocks Oh hell yes it is

[2:44:47] <Pookiedaexzile> I had to get up to do something so since Lucia is Vergil baby moms, will Dante receive blowback from this
[2:44:48] <Saltmeisterr> bye lol
[2:44:48] <darcfowler1995> I wish Nero would’ve gotten a chance to fight Dante like this in this one

[2:46:50] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @LiquidMathew probably just doesn't want to go back to restock, but also gerbera is great here
[2:46:50] <+Shadicara> I mean a breather can help brother
[2:46:52] <RichochetForce> @LiquidMathew Nero has terribly mobility and that leaves you vulnerable in this fight
[2:46:53] <%Big_Dream> Take break to thank the people pat @AngriestPat
[2:46:54] <+Jerycho_TV> this a bloody palace mission
[2:46:57] <+Jerycho_TV> ?

[2:47:03] <Gruhunchously> Vergil fights with his brother and his son in one day.

[2:47:05] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@sorridsnake12) (warning)
[2:47:05] <helpmeimafruit> @AngriestPat you can DT before the stab in the buster animation for more damage
[2:47:05] <%payterodactyl> @AngriestPat You need to drink more redbull to get more power!

[2:47:36] <+ItsAGundamu> Fuck that move never gets old
[2:47:40] <framerate_issues> you can hit summon swords back with the red queen
[2:47:41] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Never used them. Beat the game 4+ times
[2:47:43] <DrkJP520> Shhot him when he teleports above you after he blocks an attack
[2:47:45] <%Big_Dream> yes overture can work
[2:47:50] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> says pat
[2:47:50] <Gruhunchously> Oh HELL NO
[2:47:52] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat Youll never make it to regionals if you keep making rookie mistakes like THESE!!
[2:47:53] <LiquidMathew> deflecting summon swords is great
[2:47:54] <KingGuthorm> Good old Sparda family bonding
[2:47:58] <$megamonmon123> nothing is better than hitting back those summon swords
[2:48:02] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat You reflect those single summoned swords well timed sword attck
[2:48:05] <DeebzNutz100> yes you can
[2:48:10] <+MisterAngryEyes112> gerbera is better for that I think
[2:48:11] <LiquidMathew> It fucks him up like it does to you too iirc
[2:48:11] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat The Robot Buster Arms do way more damage than nero's real bringer arm. Especially fully charged.
[2:48:12] <KnightAsteran> CUHRAZY
[2:48:12] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat It gives you a free stun
[2:48:14] <Gorgodrn> And can't the Buster also knock them off?
[2:48:24] <Ipsenscastle> i'm impressed he's reading chat at the same time
[2:48:25] <$megamonmon123> you can use devil breakers 2
[2:48:28] <Pookiedaexzile> Ya'll remember when Nelo Angelo was the best fight in this series
[2:48:29] <Cowctus> vergil is basically a dark souls meta player with his katana and homing soulmass
[2:48:34] <KingGuthorm> FUCK YOU DAD
[2:48:35] <Gruhunchously> The Sparda family rivals the Skywalkers in dysfunctionality.
[2:48:36] <+asgard147> FUCK YOU DAD! SwiftRage
[2:48:44] <gustavozxd> I once did stinger as soon as vergil shot a bunch of summon swords, the game stood there for 3 seconds because there's some sort of crazy stun when you do it
[2:48:44] <+HoloToast> eurobeat intensifies
[2:48:46] <aimlesshealer> ooooooh yeah
[2:48:46] <$megamonmon123> overture has a continuous hit box to send summon swords back

[2:48:53] <BunnyEmperor> Stand shield
[2:48:54] <%Hasmeister96> @tayloctopus91 he combs the levels for stuff, and he never uses gold orbs. plus he's played this game multiple times

[2:49:36] <%QaizerArt> Did he just fucking suplex Virgil?
[2:49:38] <RichochetForce> @T_Sasquatch The stun or the Sin DT Vergil?
[2:49:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Give em the ol dick twist
[2:49:39] <+Riseskimo> don't deactivate DT during showdown, it's different in DMC5, where DT doesn't deactivate after the move finishes, but immediately, thus lowering your damage @AngriestPat
[2:49:40] <stirlingw17> damn nero has some daddy issues
[2:49:40] <PolarBear1071> you can use DT to break out of stagger in a pinch
[2:49:45] <+Sstjohn> Hey chat and pat, what difficulty is this? DMD?

[2:56:34] <PrinceOfEden> YOU DIDN'T DO IT
[2:56:34] <arisenpai> It's quite simple... just dodge everything perfectly
[2:56:34] <stirlingw17> i feel like vergil and terry crews would get along, they are both obsessed with power
[2:56:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> just pull his devil trigger. handjobs solve a lot of tension.
[2:56:35] <Morning_Asakura> boo
[2:56:36] <PrinceOfEden> YOU FUCK
[2:56:38] <%Toynota10> timing is pretty tricky
[2:56:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> So if Dante and Vergil are chilling in Hell, talking about the birds and the bees. You think Dante would let slip he did the twosome tango with Trish
[2:56:40] <LiquidMathew> @brickwall35 he's not motivated enough yet
[2:56:50] <framerate_issues> if you have the arms for it a break away will shatter the circling swords around you and give you a bunch of dt
[2:56:54] <+tigerfang86> FUCK U
[2:56:55] <+MisterAngryEyes112> seems like you have to either calibur the clone or payline to avoid the judgement cuts

[2:57:12] <+bobbyganoush> At this point, I'd just start over out of frustration.
[2:57:21] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @MisterAngryEyes112 I found it better to either shoot it down or get in the air then snatch and buster

[2:58:32] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @MisterAngryEyes112 it does, but I usually space it out so I snatch him after the fourth judgement cut. I usually avoided it that way
[2:58:40] <+天使42199> @michingmallecho thats the cycle - dmc 5 is the really good dmc game (dmc 3) dmc 6 will be the rushed but still decent game (dmc 4) and then DmC 2 PogChamp

[3:01:18] <+misterfistor> same thing lol
[3:01:19] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Is it still a win if you didn't SSS it?
[3:01:20] <kalinflip> Nero just blast vergil

[3:01:23] <kalinflip> Ass blast

[3:01:46] <%Noahccountingfortaste> why can't he come back? Yamato opens portals
[3:01:48] <%Birdigalore> And Shuffle counters Vergil's helm splitter
[3:01:49] <%Nobrev> @scorpiozilla hilt is handle
[3:01:49] <Graxe_> Vergil is also easier to stun with Nero, especially DT Vergil.
[3:01:52] <jubejube56> dmc 3 better
[3:01:52] <Shatterthought> @dero45 Nero as main character stopping shit. Dante and Vergil doing stuff in Hell to help Nero out.
[3:01:53] <Megapikman132> little pieces of tech to make it cooler/easier
[3:01:57] <reonome> LUL
[3:01:57] <nerdking5> DMD is so annoying every enemy DTs
[3:01:57] <Onamar> Vergil really can't deal with arm breakages. When he staggers you can stuff three Overtures into him and then set them off whenever you want with a DT near him

[3:02:30] <%SvenHolgersson> V BOOK
[3:02:30] <Commander_Spyke> LOL
[3:02:30] <Pookiedaexzile> LUL
[3:02:31] <+misterfistor> vergil regen'd health and stays in dt until you knocked him out of it in 3. it was bullshit
[3:02:31] <LiquidMathew> Vergil 4's arena is a bit big for my tastes
[3:02:31] <DeebzNutz100> atpSpiner
[3:02:31] <abakkus> dante hangin out on the side lmaoooo
[3:02:32] <vonmaultke> LUL OMG
[3:02:33] <%low_hell_key> IT'S SO FUCKING DUMB
[3:02:33] <Willfordbrimly> TWENTY TWO SCADOOOOOO
[3:02:33] <utari888> its funny
[3:02:34] <+Shaggnar> The naruto run woopsDab
[3:02:34] <%Ahack13> PErsonally, I think these 2 fights are the best the series has ever been.
[3:02:38] <+McSoliace> Fight*
[3:02:39] <%low_hell_key> AMAZING
[3:02:39] <$ESP_ROOT> V
[3:02:41] <%El_Desperad0> I like this fight better than the dmc3 fight, but location-wise it's ehhh
[3:02:41] <utari888> so funny
[3:02:42] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat Watch that be in DMD difficulty
[3:02:43] <kalinflip> @Ahack13 Agreed
[3:02:46] <+Midnight_Fondler> Pat Time!
[3:02:47] <+Bloodxb> also vergil becoming a jet planes is sick
[3:02:50] <%SvenHolgersson> Detroit: Become Emo
[3:02:51] <%0dokuro> It really is
[3:02:53] <jorgeniev> at least is not a v car
[3:02:54] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Gives the player more agency!
[3:03:01] <%TheFilth> it had three fights throughout the game
[3:03:02] <Megapikman132> now fight him as V Kappa
[3:03:05] <Ipsenscastle> 3 gains a lot of points just for the stronger story and set-up increasing the hype exponentially
[3:03:08] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat a shame he didn't have beowulf or force edge
[3:03:09] <kalinflip> the book actually has the pages in it
[3:03:09] <+This_is_Marco> what is he actually reading?
[3:03:11] <fabnanman> vergil becomes a rathalos in 5
[3:03:11] <%low_hell_key> YEYEYEYE you better beat the credits pat Kappa
[3:03:12] <kalinflip> LUL
[3:03:12] <utari888> LUL
[3:03:12] <Supabait> what do you think about the van being agnus as a devil arm?
[3:03:13] <DeebzNutz100> DMC3 Remake incoming?
[3:03:15] <EVA_Unit02> some guy in the back LUL
[3:03:17] <PrinceOfEden> PHONE BOOK
[3:03:17] <Gorgodrn> I think that's because the story in 3 is a bit more solid
[3:03:18] <Morning_Asakura> is that a game manuel
[3:03:21] <stirlingw17> 3 was amazing as a fight but this has so many cool parts to it
[3:03:22] <%spiritofmojave> 3 gave Lady much more to do, wish 5 had that too
[3:03:22] <VritraReiRei> Is he reading a phone book!? LUL
[3:03:23] <$ooblagis> I prefer the arena in 3, it forces you to ALWAYS be in Vergil's face, and not strafe around him in safety
[3:03:28] <freedomboyz> i like japanese nico
[3:03:32] <+GeneralHysterics> Itsuno confirmed that the van is agnus as a devil arm
[3:03:35] <gunzerkingdunce> like 5 hours
[3:03:37] <%Reaped_Psyche> Japanese Nico cute AF.
[3:03:37] <%Noahccountingfortaste> God this OST
[3:03:42] <+ultimafullmetal> I wonder if we'll have to do the Vergil fight as V in Bloody Palace.
[3:03:44] <Ki_Momento> its a cook book, a COOK BOOK!
[3:03:45] <dero45> They will probably go full reboot with older Nero and new characters maybe Dante and Vergil become bad guys
[3:03:46] <Morning_Asakura> don't ask itsuno for shit
[3:03:46] <%0dokuro> I liked it when the son power bombed the dad
[3:03:48] <kalinflip> @GeneralHysterics atpShh
[3:03:51] <+azure22900> He had no arm for like a grand total of like a month
[3:03:51] <%Tyonidus> @GeneralHysterics you're kidding
[3:03:55] <+misterfistor> nico crafted like 10 new devil breakers in like 6 hours
[3:03:55] <Willfordbrimly> Japanese Nico is too demur
[3:03:56] <sosuke5> "once"
[3:03:56] <+天使42199> atpShh
[3:03:57] <%Toynota10> I'm glad itsuno didn't leave after Capcom made DmC
[3:03:57] <T_Sasquatch> i cant believe dante got knocked out for an entire month
[3:03:58] <%ThirdWelles> @GeneralHysterics Link or bullshit
[3:04:02] <%Birdigalore> YAMATO OPENS PORTALS THO
[3:04:04] <reonome> devils never cry

[3:04:07] <%spiritofmojave> they're on hellcation
[3:04:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Ya'll Bugging, Black Nico is the hottest woman in video games, and I will put a knife in anyone who disrespects
[3:04:10] <+tigerfang86> (No)
[3:04:12] <aimlesshealer> Nero's human arm kinda weirds me out
[3:04:18] <RichochetForce> @ultimafullmetal Look up ioritree on Youtube. He has a V vs Vergil fight. V has a special kill animation for Vergil.
[3:04:18] <$ESP_ROOT> that face
[3:04:19] <%Noahccountingfortaste> @Birdigalore RIGHT?
[3:04:20] <gunzerkingdunce> they can leave WHENEVER
[3:04:21] <%0dokuro> Cant wait for Dante to turn evil now
[3:04:23] <kalinflip> bruh being gone in a devil may cry game doesnt mean shit LUL
[3:04:27] <+giogiothethird> they'll be back in 10 years
[3:04:29] <+ChipZafari> this is like the 3rd time Dante's ""trapped in hell"" and they have the sword that can open portals back to Earth
[3:04:30] <$DarkKnightGrave> They will be back for the DLC
[3:04:31] <%Ahack13> Who else is ready for buddy-cop adventures in hell?
[3:04:31] <Willfordbrimly> WHEN MUH DIDDY DIEDUH
[3:04:32] <%Tyonidus> @Pookiedaexzile lol shutup nerd the one we got in game rocks

[3:04:33] <%MagickBurritoh> FAMILEEE
[3:04:34] <+ChipZafari> they're the least trapped they've ever been
[3:04:34] <kalinflip> We all know that there will be more later
[3:04:37] <+天使42199> They find another hidden way back outta hell
[3:04:40] <+ultimafullmetal> @RichochetForce nice
[3:04:44] <+TNT3Rays> Nah dude they’re done
[3:04:44] <silverira> Vergil killed a lot of people and noone cares
[3:04:45] <%starotter70> Hell, being dead rarely mean shit
[3:04:45] <GrandmasterBFunk> Trish and Lady should be DLC
[3:04:46] <+trekkie11041> give me sparda next
[3:04:46] <+xx123manxx> Ladies Night DLC Kreygasm
[3:04:47] <kalinflip> @ChipZafari Deadass they could leave whenever
[3:04:48] <%ScreamingMeat> Vergil and Dante can leave Hell literally whenever they want. They have Yamato
[3:04:48] <jorgeniev> in fact i would dare say if they make a sequel virgil will be in the main campaing
[3:04:49] <NotHereToStream> Sparda please
[3:04:51] <+OmegaFatalis> how do you feel about Kyrie getting no screen time?
[3:04:52] <Ipsenscastle> Lady could carry a game. Fuck Trish
[3:04:54] <%Calliphor> Trish, Lady, and Nico's night out
[3:04:55] <Willfordbrimly> Why does everyone keep calling her Lusha?
[3:04:55] <+TNT3Rays> Now you get to play the live action credit sequence

[3:05:06] <+Exyoh> Nero, Lucia, new person?
[3:05:06] <GyroBrando> Nero with lady and trish could be fun
[3:05:07] <benjiFG> if Lady were to come back I wish they would give her more mobility
[3:05:07] <+tigerfang86> ALL OF THEM ONE GAME
[3:05:07] <CuttleCrow> Nero and Kyrie dating sim
[3:05:08] <RoboXGP> she goes you going to cry ? lil bitch lol

[3:05:12] <+deemans> Sparda prequel game!
[3:05:13] <+HunterInABox> DMC6 to be the Bayo crossover
[3:05:14] <gunzerkingdunce> We'll just have to see
[3:05:15] <+TNT3Rays> Trish and lady cannot carry a whole game
[3:05:15] <+MstrSwrd> Odd stages Nero on Earth, Odd Dante/Vergil in hell
[3:05:16] <%0dokuro> Nero's son
[3:05:16] <Saltmeisterr> morrison
[3:05:17] <Gorgodrn> I do think Nero can.
[3:05:18] <+chaumiester> Wait, how do you know that Lucia has the coolest Move set? Did you play DMC2?!?
[3:05:18] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> I would like a game with Sparda
[3:05:18] <AllAccordingToPlan> @Bloodxb it's already in the game
[3:05:18] <T_Sasquatch> i honestly want new characters, completely new playstyles like v
[3:05:18] <DagetStreams> Surprised Kyrie didn't get a cameo right at the end and also she was preggers or something
[3:05:19] <+Bloodxb> vergil and dante kill mundus in hell
[3:05:19] <Supabait> crew cut took notes? PogChamp
[3:05:20] <+xx123manxx> Kyries Cooking Mama game
[3:05:21] <+TNT3Rays> Bad waifus
[3:05:22] <lautalocos> visual novel with dante, nero and vergil living together
[3:05:22] <GrandmasterBFunk> seriously tho pat install the crewcut mod
[3:05:23] <phoenix_games87> im not good enough with nero its my only fear of the future of the francise
[3:05:24] <+HoloToast> Crew Cut and HUNK shoot their way through Bloody Palace
[3:05:24] <thatdudeinthecotton> V only exists as a prototype so that a new refined summoner type hunter can be made
[3:05:24] <+Shaggnar> Would anyone notice if Kyrie god screen time LUL
[3:05:25] <%Noahccountingfortaste> man this is goofy
[3:05:25] <+miguelrod777> dantes son
[3:05:26] <+MstrSwrd> *even stages Nero, odd the other 2 I mistyped sorry
[3:05:26] <dero45> But Vergil will probably leave Dante in hell cuz he’s a dik
[3:05:27] <LiquidMathew> Nero game, have Kyrie in the van with Nico
[3:05:27] <nerdking5> @angriestpat I would want a literal dantes inferno with Dante and Vergil
[3:05:28] <%starotter70> Dead Weight DLC
[3:05:29] <gunzerkingdunce> 5 is a better send off than dmcdmc

[3:05:33] <%low_hell_key> GOD THIS IS SO LAME, i love it
[3:05:34] <%absolute_weapon> It's time for Devil may Cry 0, @AngriestPat We have the basis for how Sparda should handle now with allt he powerups Dante and Vergil have
[3:05:36] <+OmegaFatalis> @kalinflip I think it sucks the didn't model her
[3:05:36] <Pookiedaexzile> @Tyonidus Bitch did I stutter, She is I will die for that country bumpkin
[3:05:37] <%ScreamingMeat> @AngriestPat The only thing keeping Dante and Vergil in Hell is their search for shits and giggles
[3:05:38] <$ESP_ROOT> :)
[3:05:43] <%0dokuro> Its not a power glove without you
[3:05:44] <PrinceOfEden> @silverira I said the same thing, but someone made a great arugment. That was the demon separated Virgil. The same way you can't say Virgil helped save dante since V did, N'aw mean?
[3:05:47] <%GueyDuckB> Nico as a driving game
[3:05:48] <wydamn> Crew cut's campaign is just a call of duty man in a devil may cry world.
[3:05:51] <Willfordbrimly> Did Nico just call Nero a work of art?
[3:05:51] <+天使42199> ass

[3:06:17] <Supabait> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[3:06:18] <%starotter70> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[3:06:18] <RichochetForce> Sparda was a humorless OP monster. He cannot carry a game.
[3:06:19] <GyroBrando> Just make sparda story and then he just does everithing everyone has ever made in dmc
[3:06:19] <+HoloToast> my first time there I tried to pause to read the moves, I skipped LUL
[3:06:19] <+giogiothethird> dmc zero with sparda and his gamg
[3:06:21] <shotgang86> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[3:06:21] <%brickwall35> GOTTA LET IT OUT
[3:06:21] <%Ahack13> So how many do you have to kill here?

[3:06:25] <%daisyyyy> Its like Bayo but with a dude
[3:06:26] <AllAccordingToPlan> I want a DMC game about what happened immediately after mundus killed his mom
[3:06:26] <mak0t0yukii> SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls SourPls
[3:06:27] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> 0 could set up a future villain or rival "clan" to the Spardas
[3:06:28] <%ScreamingMeat> A game on Sparda's war against Mundus would be awesome
[3:06:29] <0rond> @AngriestPat btw if you press start right now it will just skip this part
[3:06:30] <LiquidMathew> Sparda game where one mission is just beating all the dmc3 guardians and locking them up in the tower
[3:06:30] <benjiFG> bless you matt walker
[3:06:31] <KinduVborrd> Move fast baby
[3:06:31] <PrinceOfEden> @Mnightshyamallama 3 was the origin of Dante and Virgil
[3:06:31] <+tigerfang86> GOTTA LET IT OUUUT
[3:06:35] <gunzerkingdunce> just have it be him trying to be with Eva in the afterlife
[3:06:40] <$MightyMaxT> Is there a diifference between Devil Snatch and Wire Snatch?
[3:06:40] <aimlesshealer> Once in the shower, I wrote out a whole prequel to the DMC3 prequel with babby Dante as Tony Redgrave. And then I forgot all of it.
[3:06:41] <Commander_Spyke> @holotoast same pvpWhy
[3:06:42] <Pookiedaexzile> So are we gettin a Sparda DLC campagin...Cuz I'm dropping 30 bucks for that no question
[3:06:43] <+天使42199> @Ahack13 I dont think this one has a kill amount
[3:06:48] <%aivalera> There is a major crashing issue after these fights on Xbone, I'vce hit it three times and it's a massive bummer
[3:06:49] <+Exyoh> After this game, I trust Itsuno to make more sweet movesets, but would Sparda ever live up to the hype?
[3:06:49] <%0dokuro> Either a Sparda game or a game where Dante turns evil for once.
[3:06:50] <Them00n> @angriestpat Do you think V will ever return?
[3:06:51] <Mnightshyamallama> @PrinceOfEden exactly
[3:06:52] <Shatterthought> @daisyyyy DMC was first, so... Bayo is like DMC but with a woman. SeemsGood
[3:06:52] <%Tyonidus> heck yeah brother I love this dang game, Dante Must Die difficulty is giving me a rough time though.
[3:06:53] <evbites> also they explained what rebellion and yamato do so it's a perfect setup
[3:06:54] <LiquidMathew> @MightyMaxT animation only as far as i know
[3:06:57] <DraxTD> faster pat, more style
[3:06:58] <%Ahack13> Well, you get Dialog changes based on your preformance
[3:06:59] <zerocruz> Everyone would be down with waking up to justice on a DMC 0
[3:06:59] <%JJCheeker> What's up everybody
[3:07:01] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> Nero: tho fucketh not with me
[3:07:01] <AlasterAngelo> RUINED
[3:07:05] <+giogiothethird> shinji mikami was lead artist in this game????
[3:07:11] <dero45> If they do continue I see maybe Dante and Vergil dying to pass the torch to Nero completely and that will be a sad day
[3:07:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DT
[3:07:15] <CuttleCrow> DT
[3:07:18] <PrinceOfEden> @Mnightshyamallama He's talking about actually playing as Sparda and seeing his story. Since we never actually do.
[3:07:18] <candidateplays> I think they expect you to spam Breakag
[3:07:19] <derekwst3> you can use the jump taunt on the tony hawk section and get the blue orb.....i just wanted to test if i could do it
[3:07:20] <%FrustratedAF> do you even get rorbs?
[3:07:20] <$HentaiSenpai9K> Are you gonna play something else? Maybe Yakuzies?
[3:07:20] <KinduVborrd> Different Shinji Mikami, I'd assume
[3:07:21] <+tigerfang86> ARM ON FIRE
[3:07:21] <nerdking5> DT
[3:07:22] <%spiritofmojave> Give us a Sparda game with a definite Bayo connection to it too and I"m one happy boy
[3:07:22] <%brickwall35> BANG BANG BANG
[3:07:23] <+OmegaFatalis> I think they could weave Sparda's war on Mundus into Mundus's return in the present like they jump around in this game
[3:07:25] <+Shaggnar> woopsD 📣 PULL MY DEVIL TRIGGER
[3:07:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@low_hell_key) (warning)
[3:07:26] <%aivalera> DT starts maxed
[3:07:26] <$megamonmon123> you guys know you can grab berserker enemies out of their armour?
[3:07:27] <+tigerfang86> BANG BANG BANG
[3:07:28] <kalinflip> Yo vergil goes fucking nuts on the dante part
[3:07:29] <PrinceOfEden> It's always "SPARDA WAS THE GOAT" but then he fucked off somewhere.
[3:07:30] <benjiFG> overture is even better when you use knuckle to prevent the enemy from flying away
[3:07:35] <isolex_> that was sick
[3:07:36] <+HoloToast> no hud, you don't know if you need to style or kill, ...
[3:07:37] <%AllYouCanYeet> cheesing it with buster makes it pretty easy. I can't do the dante version of this tho
[3:07:38] <jorgeniev> do you think they will add new skills to the game?
[3:07:39] <kalinflip> Like dimension slash everything
[3:07:40] <%low_hell_key> fucking moobot
[3:07:40] <Mnightshyamallama> @PrinceOfEden and it should stay that way

[3:07:45] <%JJCheeker> Oh shoot did I miss the rest of the stream
[3:07:46] <%ThirdWelles> and nothing else?
[3:07:46] <GrandmasterBFunk> Like, we don't even know if Sparda is dead or not right?
[3:07:48] <%Toynota10> With Heaven or Hell mode, you can blow through the whole game as long as you don't get hit lol
[3:07:49] <%MrBorisMakarov> you're doing a big good job
[3:07:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Kill 100 demons
[3:07:50] <a_mad_dragon> pat confirmed for HUD bitch
[3:07:50] <$ooblagis> CLOSE
[3:07:51] <%MagickBurritoh> Sparda either went into space or heaven
[3:07:51] <Quikanims> Devil Trigger > Devils Never Cry > Shall Never Surrender > Lock and Load
[3:07:53] <%pupperpuzzlersupreme> CLOSE
[3:07:54] <PrinceOfEden> I don't agree, I would love to play as Sparda.
[3:07:55] <%tyler274> inb4 Sparda fucked off for CBT in all universes
[3:07:58] <Jane_Lo> lil bro FeelsGoodMan

[3:08:08] <vendrys1> nico calling nero lil bro makes me so fucking happy
[3:08:10] <%0dokuro> Aniki?
[3:08:14] <%aivalera> Why is never surrender playing?
[3:08:14] <%FrustratedAF> yeah i stopped being a fan of these live-action scenes after like... 3 missions.
[3:08:16] <%treebeard24> don't quote me on it but im fairly certain they give you on of each devil breaker for that moment so you can spam break ages too
[3:08:16] <%MagickBurritoh> Space demons
[3:08:18] <+tigerfang86> MEANWHILE
[3:08:19] <banjokazumi> No hud with Dante is so hard m
[3:08:21] <+miguelrod777> Ara Ara says nico
[3:08:24] <+HoloToast> rebellion PogChamp
[3:08:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> Sparda isn't dead, right? I thought he was just banished for eternity.
[3:08:28] <+Exyoh> They didn't have the music for the mock-ups
[3:08:29] <Pookiedaexzile> Woah woah whatcha doing there little bro...thats disgusting
[3:08:30] <%0dokuro> He does
[3:08:32] <Gorgodrn> Kyodai more than aniki
[3:08:35] <+AXL808> Gotta cut this green screen down
[3:08:35] <phoenix_games87> i think this is before they made dmc5 music but this is pretty bad ass lol
[3:08:35] <didgereedoodah> cut down the WALL
[3:08:36] <%Nobrev> he really is and I love it
[3:08:39] <aimlesshealer> Vergil chilled the fuck out
[3:08:39] <%Noahccountingfortaste> I miss V
[3:08:40] <Mnightshyamallama> @PrinceOfEden sparda works better as a legend instead of someone to play as, just like The Boss in the MGS lore
[3:08:42] <CuttleCrow> basically Vegeta
[3:08:43] <kalinflip> He learned alot while V was alive
[3:08:43] <jorgeniev> the time has come and so have I
[3:08:46] <%0dokuro> Stupid Demon Adventures the game
[3:08:47] <+advoccat> PLS Vergil
[3:08:47] <%spiritofmojave> I want wacky adventures in hell with Dante and Vergil DLC/patch
[3:08:48] <+HoloToast> I'm sure Vergil would love Pizza
[3:08:48] <GrandmasterBFunk> Ignore the like, hundreds of thousands of people he killed
[3:08:49] <%Ahack13> @AngriestPat I think thats the plan
[3:08:49] <Lotharman> Which is awesome
[3:08:50] <$DarkKnightGrave> It is mostly because of V.
[3:08:50] <vonmaultke> LUL
[3:08:51] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat But he's killed so many people! He's a villian!!!
[3:08:51] <+MisterAngryEyes112> V rejoining him really had an impact!
[3:08:52] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat this is an extremely happy ending for a DMC game
[3:08:52] <RantingRavager> Virgil May Cry
[3:08:53] <+miguelrod777> he killed alot of people
[3:08:55] <Supabait> F in chat for all the humans vergil killed to make his blood fruit smoothie PepeHands
[3:08:55] <Megapikman132> give me more Virgil SOL adventures.
[3:08:57] <Fiendmaw> Yeah,when he reunited with V,he definitely changed
[3:08:58] <stirlingw17> @rumtumtugnutz he is into CBT in some pocket domintion due to mundus
[3:08:58] <GyroBrando> Just make vergil playable and ill pay that's it
[3:08:59] <%Demon_Shadow4> dont they hate eachother?
[3:08:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> what would vergil like on his pizza
[3:08:59] <0rond> "lil-bro" is the most japanese thing in this game, AND VERGIL IS IN THIS GAME
[3:09:00] <OkoPoko> Do you dislike how he's changed?
[3:09:01] <$ESP_ROOT> SourPls
[3:09:02] <+TransporterX7> Dude finally melloed out
[3:09:02] <T_Sasquatch> @GrandmasterBFunk that was urizen
[3:09:02] <%sshen> He got sasuked yeah sorry
[3:09:03] <danknugglit> Vergetta PogChamp
[3:09:04] <Pookiedaexzile> All it took was 1 ass kicking and now he's full on vergeta
[3:09:04] <+HoloToast> Vergil's Bizarre Adventure
[3:09:05] <+TNT3Rays> Vergil will never die
[3:09:05] <Gorgodrn> He'll tag along, but pretend to not like it like Piccolo at the start of Z
[3:09:07] <+Bloodxb> vergil becomes a co owner of devil may cey
[3:09:07] <kalinflip> I have grown to love subhuman
[3:09:08] <+xx123manxx> The "Whered you learn to count" line shows how different he is
[3:09:08] <+tigerfang86> @AngriestPat vergil tags along with dante so every mission ends with a salty vergil fight over some dumb argument
[3:09:09] <shotgang86> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[3:09:10] <+MisterAngryEyes112> SDT is the key here
[3:09:10] <PrinceOfEden> @Mnightshyamallama Again, I disagree. The majority of the DMC community wants to truly know Sparda's story.
[3:09:10] <+TheQButton> @AngriestPat that's true but I want V back.
[3:09:11] <+Sstjohn> I like Vergil and Nero sitting in the van next to each other
[3:09:11] <whobeee> Vergil made his peace and now maybe he can willingly split into V for future games?
[3:09:12] <evbites> ew subhuman
[3:09:13] <buffmurffy> vergil and dante should run a pizza shop. judgement cut slices
[3:09:13] <+HoloToast> SourPls
[3:09:13] <$MightyMaxT> Vergil's Rising
[3:09:13] <wydamn> RIGHT IN THE BUTT
[3:09:15] <Gorgodrn> I mean, there's a reason they put him in the van
[3:09:16] <+advoccat> Vergil Dante hell roadtravle pls
[3:09:17] <AllAccordingToPlan> I AM ERMERGER
[3:09:17] <%MagickBurritoh> so hell is just the hunter's dream?
[3:09:18] <dero45> Vergil will probably become full good guy then die and give Yamato to Nero giving him sin Nero I see it BibleThump
[3:09:18] <+MisterAngryEyes112> otherwise its impossible basically
[3:09:18] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Next adventure Vergil has to pay all the child supoort he owes.
[3:09:24] <killuaru> guys 40 bucks for dmc 5 with all dlc is a good price? tsosHMM
[3:09:24] <%Trinity5> YOU CANNOT KILL ME SwiftRage
[3:09:25] <derekwst3> they will use magic on the book and v will be reborn
[3:09:26] <%ThirdWelles> Now DANTE'S HUD being missing I can understand. Cuz 8 different weapons and all.
[3:09:27] <PrinceOfEden> It's fine if you feel otherwise, but our reasoning won't change.
[3:09:27] <+Blaxel411> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[3:09:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> @stirlingw17 that's what I thought
[3:09:29] <+天使42199> SourPls
[3:09:31] <GrandmasterBFunk> @T_Sasquatch DMC 3 tho
[3:09:32] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> "No, Urizen killed those people." coxWat
[3:09:34] <+天使42199> this song kicks ass
[3:09:36] <+xx123manxx> I fucking hate those red predator enemies, worst in the whole game
[3:09:37] <J2m0ftw> @AngriestPat turn off devmode for the last frame?
[3:09:37] <$megamonmon123> dont forget sin dt
[3:09:37] <%Ion_Laser> @Gogogolem that's a shit ton of child support LUL
[3:09:40] <+azure22900> But Vergil just wants to beat Dante, you can see him fidgeting like crazy in the van while staring at Dante reading the magazine.
[3:09:44] <eco419> YOU CANNOT
[3:09:46] <+TheQButton> @AngriestPat Just make V a style like gunslinger or something.
[3:09:46] <AlasterAngelo> I let Vergil deal with the Furies fuck those guys
[3:09:46] <Mnightshyamallama> @PrinceOfEden you know his story already. Playing as him would only make people compare him to the characters that you already play as
[3:09:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> except for the CBD thing
[3:09:48] <existingdark> I love how V and Nero were seeming to grow to be really good best buds throughout the early missions
[3:09:48] <kalinflip> I love the Judgement cuts
[3:09:50] <wydamn> Next game is Vergil and Nero awkwardly throwing a baseball back and forth.
[3:09:51] <gustavozxd> @killuaru godlike price tbh
[3:09:51] <kalinflip> looks so good
[3:09:56] <kalinflip> He will
[3:09:59] <%aivalera> "You cannot kill me," says subhuman. "Capcom will put me in DMC6!"
[3:09:59] <nerdking5> DMC6 Dantes Inferno Featuring Vergil from the dmc series
[3:10:01] <Pookiedaexzile> I would give this game 40 bucks for Nico Nudes and a phone call from Dantes voice actor
[3:10:02] <+HoloToast> killuaru hell yeah, I got it for 55€ and it's worth more than that IMO
[3:10:07] <jorgeniev> i want virgil to be standing next to dante looking at him with a disaproving look everytime he starts doing stupid shit.
[3:10:07] <T_Sasquatch> @GrandmasterBFunk true but lets be real , normal people are practically irrelevant in this series
[3:10:08] <PrinceOfEden> @Mnightshyamallama No we don't. "He rose to justice and fought people and hell."
[3:10:15] <%Nobrev> wahoo
[3:10:16] <aimlesshealer> @Mnightshyamallama I agree, Sparda is better as a legend
[3:10:19] <Morning_Asakura> YOU CANNOT KILL ME
[3:10:25] <+HoloToast> wahoo weehee pizza yeehaww
[3:10:26] <Deano8817> "it is NOT WAHOO TIME DANTE"
[3:10:26] <killuaru> @HoloToast because i can get it for 29£ since i got promocode
[3:10:27] <Ned_the_Ninja_spams_R1> man, the scooter is awesome
[3:10:30] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat what do you think of new Cerberus?
[3:10:31] <PrinceOfEden> @Mnightshyamallama By that logic, I could say Dante fought demons and saved the world and expect people to be satisfied with that.
[3:10:33] <kalinflip> The dmc games focus on the legacy the off spring off sparda make
[3:10:36] <%apostateCourier> DMCV is so extra, it has TWO credits combat sequences
[3:10:39] <+miguelrod777> vergil killed a city in dmc 3
[3:10:40] <CuttleCrow> FAILED
[3:10:40] <+tigerfang86> OWNED
[3:10:41] <shotgang86> I AM OMEGA
[3:10:43] <Pookiedaexzile> Ypu should be able to hit Vergil and start another boss fight
[3:10:43] <%aivalera> Also, you start out with a max SIN trigger in this fight
[3:10:43] <%low_hell_key> YOU DONE FUCKED
[3:10:43] <RoboXGP> Nico is jewish, her last name is Goldstein
[3:10:43] <GrandmasterBFunk> @T_Sasquatch Oh yeah, i honestly don't care, i wont Vergil to be the star of a game for once, it's just funny

[3:11:56] <Supabait> i mean its the DMC universe so who knows
[3:11:56] <Willfordbrimly> You really cant use real food when shooting takes. Sometimes youd have to eat multiple slices due to multiple takes

[3:12:10] <dukenux> She can sharpie her name over it
[3:12:10] <bleugh> lady dropped out of school
[3:12:10] <alrobot2014> then she'll just change her name to morrison
[3:12:12] <+Sstjohn> Idk why but I was totally expecting like a full on black guy for Morrison
[3:12:12] <LiquidMathew> Dante would definitely just put "whoever has this is the owner" he's lazy like that
[3:12:13] <AlasterAngelo> @Pookiedaexzile yeah it stands for Dismal

[3:13:04] <Goldenwolf98> Its not surprising tho
[3:13:05] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Did Dante go to school
[3:13:06] <abakkus> """might be""""
[3:13:06] <IminyourBase> dude he is fucking hella stupid. the boy never went to school

[3:13:06] <CuttleCrow> can't even read LUL
[3:13:07] <+OmegaFatalis> It's like Tekken rules. If you beat up Heihachi you get his company
[3:13:07] <rosemon5001> WAS that a timer for how long they have been doing it?
[3:13:07] <Forester_Skippy> hah thinking a pizza can count god one
[3:13:07] <+HostilePoundcakes> LUL
[3:13:08] <wydamn> Dante does math at a grade 4 level
[3:13:08] <%JJCheeker> 2 + 2 is 5?
[3:13:08] <takokasa> Dante was orphaned as a kid. He probably has a primary school education at best
[3:13:09] <helpmeimafruit> I never learned how to reaaaaad
[3:13:09] <GrandmasterBFunk> Dante is a dumb dumb virgin and i love him
[3:13:09] <%shockzndrawe> I still love Dante
[3:13:09] <mak0t0yukii> Stupid like goku?
[3:13:10] <%starotter70> But unsurprising
[3:13:10] <%spiritofmojave> I remember that line about him not having to use his brain this much LUL
[3:13:10] <+MstrSwrd> I thin it's just supposed to be that he's tired and miscounted

[3:13:11] <Gold13821> Dante is Goku confirmed
[3:13:12] <evbites> he never went to school
[3:13:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dante might be illiterate

[3:13:14] <GyroBrando> Is dante illetrate? we dont know could be
[3:13:14] <$MightyMaxT> Literally Goku, Vegeta and Trunks
[3:13:14] <+HunterInABox> Why do you think Dante is always broke? It's because he stupid
[3:13:14] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Dante is secretly Illiterate .
[3:13:15] <Pookiedaexzile> I thought we settled that he is the dumbest man of all time
[3:13:17] <AlasterAngelo> Dante's house burned down when he was 8 give him a break
[3:13:18] <LiquidMathew> Dante was just counting the other wins against Vergil
[3:13:18] <%Ion_Laser> Dante might be undercharging his services LUL
[3:13:19] <+miguelrod777> hes goku levels of intelligent
[3:13:19] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> when would he have got an education
[3:13:19] <RoboXGP> gaay
[3:13:20] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Where would he have gone to school?
[3:13:20] <+Afrobrawler> think it was just suggesting they fight alot
[3:13:20] <%willjar313> Dante thinks 2+2= WOO-HOO PIZZA TIME.
[3:13:21] <phoenix_games87> remember how in the mission he he said makes my brain hurt solving this puzzle lol
[3:13:22] <derekwst3> he was a orphan and doubt he went to school
[3:13:23] <dukenux> Yeah, not quite Goky stupid but still
[3:13:23] <benjiFG> I assumed Dante and Vergil received schooling at Sparda's big mansion
[3:13:24] <%aivalera> Hey, now lock and load is playing
[3:13:25] <%rdark_ksu> I thought his character was charming dumb asshole
[3:13:25] <JeoDood> dante never went to school
[3:13:26] <zerocruz> Dante didn’t go to school
[3:13:26] <+HoloToast> Demons are like a box of chocolate
[3:13:26] <BunnyEmperor> Vergil is the brain, Dante the muscle, thats how the gimmick works
[3:13:26] <abakkus> dante cant count and has never fucked
[3:13:27] <%daisyyyy> This is the HAPPIEST ending
[3:13:27] <TheDr0t> @AngriestPat virgils hair realy bothers me
[3:13:28] <CuttleCrow> can't read, just watches cartoons, and eats pizza
[3:13:28] <+flamingmonkies2> you don't have to be smart to be cool
[3:13:29] <%Tyonidus> He can't be though, he picks up these crazy weird demon weapons and INSTANTLY styles with them and understands how they work and all their intricacies.
[3:13:29] <wydamn> man, those sparks
[3:13:30] <dukenux> Hey, they're pretty good...
[3:13:31] <Pookiedaexzile> HE literally sells demon weapons to randos

[3:19:31] <%spiritofmojave> This dance is cursed
[3:19:32] <LiquidMathew> meme dance is clearly Vergil's
[3:19:33] <+GeneralHysterics> ...I actually really like it. It's too stupid, it has to fuck with enemies
[3:19:36] <DeebzNutz100> Can the taunt be done wile holdong an enemy?
[3:19:36] <Them00n> @angriestpat V dies in 2 hits in this mode.
[3:19:37] <%Hasmeister96> do the Empusa not have DTs?
[3:19:37] <42nfl19> Wait can you taunt while doing a hold?
[3:19:38] <%TempestaDePrimo> Wait is the arm a gundam reference?

[3:19:56] <%0dokuro> Make my day
[3:19:58] <VritraReiRei> Just do it in the Void, it's super hard to pull off practically
[3:20:00] <%joylent_blue> TempestaDePrimo it is
[3:20:04] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat these guys don't get to effected by it but every other enemy does
[3:20:04] <kalinflip> @TempestaDePrimo Huge dumb
[3:20:05] <gustavozxd> @tempestadeprimo yes actually
[3:20:10] <vendrys1> V's EX taunt is goofy as fuck and I love it, plus you can do it all the way with him pretty often, even on DMD
[3:20:10] <pwnhills> It's just an Empusa tho
[3:20:10] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat They take less damage and they're harder to stun, they can also be juggled
[3:20:11] <BadgerDK> it varies from enemy to enemy what they get from DT
[3:20:11] <+TransporterX7> Oh no they have hits of super armor
[3:20:13] <%Tyonidus> @TempestaDePrimo this one is yeah, it's a pre-order bonus
[3:20:13] <+MisterAngryEyes112> Just an empusa
[3:20:14] <+misterfistor> its the first enemy in the game pat jeez
[3:20:14] <+wwwwwww1> @tempestadeprimo yeah, mechanical designer did the design for the gerbera
[3:20:15] <Goldenwolf98> They are just the basic enemy Pat

[3:20:19] <%low_hell_key> oh just you wait pat
[3:20:22] <phoenix_games87> its the first mission though
[3:20:23] <gustavozxd> Nero's chewing gum taunt is good too
[3:20:23] <%spiritofmojave> I could only pull it off on lower difficulties, the animation on the dances is way too long
[3:20:25] <+trekkie11041> dosent seem that hard with the easiset enemy in the game
[3:20:26] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Go a little further, you know, to actual enemies
[3:20:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> the tutorial doesn't seem that hard
[3:20:30] <$MightyMaxT> Oh, does it not have the extra enemies from SOS?
[3:20:32] <+xx123manxx> well heres your first taste with the queen damn thing has 9000HP
[3:20:33] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat V's EX taunt is literally 'singing in the rain'
[3:20:34] <Gogeta957> If you pull off the entire dance in a fight you get instant S and orbs rain upon you
[3:20:36] <+goatofdeparture666> empusa queen is a rude awakening
[3:20:38] <PolarBear1071> the first enemies of the game generally arent hard, even on dmd, my first wall was artemis
[3:20:38] <%0dokuro> "I'm singing in the rain"
[3:20:39] <%TempestaDePrimo> Thanks for the clarification guys. And yeah I am also huge dumb
[3:20:40] <+Shadicara> "This doesn't seem that hard" on the most jobber enemy LUL

[3:21:05] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat you can snatch some enemys once they get some damage or a small stun on them but otherwise furries and the berserker guys can't be now
[3:21:05] <gustavozxd> V on hell hell is making me salty AF
[3:21:06] <%joylent_blue> LOSER
[3:21:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Remember though they used to die in two hits

[3:21:45] <+ItsAGundamu> @AngriestPat all enemys have double health from SoS
[3:21:45] <stirlingw17> @AngriestPat it's double the health they have on SOS
[3:21:46] <%spiritofmojave> this is just the iceberg

[3:21:58] <PrinceOfEden> @AngriestPat You can rev with that buster.
[3:22:00] <UnusualSalmon> @AngriestPat I'm pretty sure that some enemies in DMD have more health that goliath does in Human mode
[3:22:01] <+HoloToast> basically Berial
[3:22:06] <BadgerDK> you can exceed that grab
[3:22:07] <%ragerunner2020> apatBig
[3:22:12] <mayorrev> taunt em
[3:22:12] <%aivalera> @AngriestPat Gotta tauynt it
[3:22:14] <stirlingw17> @BadgerDK no
[3:22:17] <Morning_Asakura> you can exceed most busters
[3:22:18] <BadgerDK> yes
[3:22:20] <+MisterAngryEyes112> They have to get to like 40% or something or a taunt I think
[3:22:22] <+asperger_mode> could you imagine limited ammo and weapon durability
[3:22:26] <%spiritofmojave> @PrinceOfEden Nobodies are pretty bad yeah, struggled with these guys and Furys more tho
[3:22:32] <NeonBleu> no you dont
[3:22:35] <jubejube56> tbf this enemy has a DT mechanic built in when she drinks blood
[3:22:36] <%Nobrev> no you dont
[3:22:39] <phoenix_games87> when she drinks blood isnt she kinda DT already though
[3:22:40] <fruit_pie_the_magician> its just time based
[3:22:41] <+MisterAngryEyes112> There you go
[3:22:41] <PrinceOfEden> You don't have to taunt it, who said that?
[3:22:43] <gustavozxd> no it's not
[3:22:45] <lautalocos> they also dt at low health

[3:25:25] <+HoloToast> devil may shit and cum
[3:25:29] <bazz_tv> did he finish sos?
[3:25:32] <%TempestaDePrimo> Ah this song
[3:25:33] <+tigerfang86> yea
[3:25:33] <+kyuubisonic> hell and hell is a nightmare
[3:25:34] <%joylent_blue> yeah bazz_tv
[3:25:36] <@Fuggins4U> time for Devil & Knuckles mode
[3:25:36] <pectusumbra> yes
[3:25:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> emlo is being a cloud with paige
[3:25:49] <gustavozxd> I was having a good time with hell and hell until V's mission
[3:26:00] <%El_Desperad0> Hell and Hell with V is actually a nightmare
[3:26:03] <aimlesshealer> Does Dante actually not need to eat, or is that just Pat and Woolie's weird headcanon?
[3:26:04] <gustavozxd> Nightmare gets hit once you go back to 0 DT
[3:26:11] <%joylent_blue> seems like DMD and HaH are where V shits the bed
[3:26:33] <bazz_tv> inb4 the release LDK along Bloody Palace
[3:26:35] <+kyuubisonic> dmd with V isnt so bad honestly
[3:26:36] <%joylent_blue> gustavozxd whaaaaaaat the fuck
[3:26:42] <gustavozxd> "shadow protect me" "huh" *dies* hell and hell in a nutshell
[3:26:47] <%laserbeaming> They should bring the SMT: Nocturne Demi-Fiend as an optional super bossfight
[3:26:50] <%spiritofmojave> DMD with V is still feasible atleast, but HaH is just... ugh
[3:26:54] <+kyuubisonic> except V cant heal
[3:26:54] <%Toynota10> is hell and hell still one hit kill
[3:27:02] <derekwst3> he says that's it but then goes to the bathroom, are we doing more?
[3:27:16] <UnusualSalmon> Hey so does anyone here know how to unlock that alternate V costume that Pat was using?
[3:27:24] <%MarylandJutsu> probably thanking swubscrwibers @derekwst3
[3:27:30] <gustavozxd> @joylent_blue I have to check if that happens only when you mount nightmare but yeah, if nightmare gets hit he goes to 0 health, that health is technically your DT, so RIP
[3:27:32] <%Hasmeister96> @derekwst3 I think he's just going to read donations now
[3:27:38] <+loonymatt> the blue one?
[3:28:08] <%joylent_blue> UnusualSalmon you have to either kill enough enemies in the credits as Nero, or kill more enemies than Vergil in Dante's credits (i think)
[3:28:12] <%XzileGaming> remember to HOST WOOLIE, you shitlord
[3:28:17] <%Toynota10> @angriestpat Soooo, you gonna play Spectre Knight any time soon?

[3:30:39] <%Dr00_PhD> you were just sick dood take it easy
[3:30:40] <+asgard147> we worry not enough
[3:30:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> like it's great you want our opinions

[3:30:52] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat still farming mutagen samples. kill me
[3:30:54] <+TheQButton> You sound like my doctor telling me I worry to much.
[3:30:57] <%joylent_blue> Toynota10 supposedly they age normally
[3:31:00] <+PanicSwytch> do what makes u feel best
[3:31:05] <VritraReiRei> Can you show the Joke Ending on Stream please? TakeNRG
[3:31:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> but you're the one who is doing this for our entertainment.
[3:31:08] <aimlesshealer> No they're not
[3:31:10] <Kisiel250> But Sparda died of old age
[3:31:15] <UnusualSalmon> Unless one of them kills the other first
[3:31:18] <CuttleCrow> Pat, we're worrying about our content!
[3:31:23] <gunzerkingdunce> They just physically age slowly
[3:31:26] <%yeknomlive> we dont know sparda died
[3:31:27] <%El_Desperad0> They age like trees
[3:31:29] <%KaironFortressKnight> KaironFortressKnight subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Hey Pat. I can't stop playing DMC5. I'm already on DMD Mission 18, and I kinda want Bloody Palace now.
[3:31:40] <%brickwall35> LUL
[3:31:48] <%JJCheeker> Interesting there's lotion right next to you... Kappa
[3:31:48] <%willjar313> @Kisiel250 Didn't Sparda also lose a huge chunk of his power beforehand?
[3:31:48] <Kirby_Sauce> HUMILIATION
[3:31:49] <PsychoFlash1> @Kisiel250 plot twist: he faked his own death to go live in the bahamas
[3:31:53] <%Demon_Shadow4> so whats the experation date on nero? a few hundred years? Thousands?
[3:32:11] <$ESP_ROOT> go to bed bitch
[3:32:13] <%0dokuro> Couple Millennia give or take
[3:32:14] <CuttleCrow> yes, Pat should use that "lotion" Kappa
[3:32:22] <%joylent_blue> nero, just like dante and vergil, will age normally, devs have said they age normally
[3:32:29] <May_yervis_canut> !uptime
[3:32:30] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 32m.
[3:32:33] <%JJCheeker> I'm sure he'll use it a little later
[3:32:33] <%mastertwin2> If demons are immortal, then Dante and Vergil would be half of that, right?
[3:32:39] <%0dokuro> "normally"
[3:32:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> but the important question remains. Sega may not release Judgement in North America.
[3:32:47] <aimlesshealer> I can't imagine Sparda got killed by something, because there's no way you wouldn't hear whoever got him gloating about it
[3:32:52] <rekinom> Mustard Momma
[3:32:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> cause of durgs
[3:32:54] <abakkus> whats half of immortal
[3:32:57] <%joylent_blue> Dante is obviously getting noticeably older
[3:32:57] <May_yervis_canut> !time
[3:33:00] <Razor4145> !uptime
[3:33:00] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 33m.
[3:33:04] <%SaltyDongs> you read that already
[3:33:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> how does that make you feel
[3:33:18] <bsmusic> same here
[3:33:22] <CuttleCrow> the gamer goo?
[3:33:24] <%Dr00_PhD> You get different cutscenes depending on who you beat first
[3:33:24] <%Noahccountingfortaste> you have to defeat griffon before shadow or something like that
[3:33:25] <%SaltyDongs> hope she gets better soon
[3:33:35] <%JJCheeker> The proto molecule?
[3:33:36] <%0dokuro> while Vergil's voice gets higher
[3:33:36] <+OmegaFatalis> I think it depends on how you beat shadow and griffon
[3:33:37] <%El_Desperad0> Does the twins activating their Sin DTs make them immortal now?
[3:33:37] <%Big_Dream> nah dante just needs a shave then he will de age
[3:33:38] <%Noahccountingfortaste> the alternate scenes are just whether they escape together or alone
[3:33:39] <%FrustratedAF> peach is still in a state of dying?

[3:36:09] <TheDr0t> @AngriestPat have you seen a twitch clip of vergil got oneshoted by he's own summon sword?
[3:36:11] <%joylent_blue> why is he taking so long to finish it PunOko
[3:36:12] <$HentaiSenpai9K> I think Vergil reproduced asexually and gave birth to Nero
[3:36:12] <%0dokuro> borned
[3:36:13] <%laserbeaming> don't bug woolie!

[3:36:21] <%Toynota10> I'd be shocked if Woolie hasn't been spoiled yet
[3:36:21] <%mastertwin2> Was horrificly sick today and watching Vergil beat the shit out of Pat somehow made me feel better

[3:37:13] <%cvp5127> oh japan

[3:37:18] <%FrustratedAF> apatBig yawns for the end of strong streams
[3:37:31] <%maskedriderhero> Thats what I mean, they aint releasing that thing until they scrub that actor out big hard
[3:37:33] <%brickwall35> it's free real estate
[3:37:37] <aimlesshealer> Who are you and what have you done with Pat
[3:37:40] <zebexter> hello everyone
[3:37:41] <%Ion_Laser> the VA is going to be recast and the lines will be re-recorded for that Judgement game probably
[3:37:45] <@SSaryn> Nothing's better than FREE.
[3:37:46] <VritraReiRei> @joylent_blue DMC5? because he's only going to play it when they are recording the LP
[3:37:47] <%Codemaster7777> did i miss it
[3:37:50] <%FrustratedAF> @aimlesshealer he hasn't had canned energy in some time
[3:37:55] <%Noahccountingfortaste> nah, that's hell or hell
[3:37:57] <artoflec> his summons die very quickly
[3:37:58] <Oqzar> everyone dies instantly
[3:38:01] <@SSaryn> V is a problem in DMD.
[3:38:02] <derekwst3> don't get hit
[3:38:02] <%Noahccountingfortaste> V on DMD isn't terrible
[3:38:06] <%ShaneWhite> I got to give money though @AngriestPat
[3:38:09] <%apostateCourier> don't get hit
[3:38:10] <%Ion_Laser> LUL
[3:38:11] <@SSaryn> WHY DO YOU DO THIS
[3:38:12] <%joylent_blue> VritraReiRei no i get that, just why hasn't he recorded it already FeelsBadMan
[3:38:12] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[3:38:13] <derekwst3> v is easy to use
[3:38:21] <Tracazoid> I found V the toughest on DMD out of the three characters but that might be far more experience with Nero and Dante.
[3:38:22] <%apostateCourier> he's a fragile hoo-man
[3:38:25] <%joylent_blue> VritraReiRei if you're busy you're busy though
[3:38:28] <%shockzndrawe> Pay to win SSaryn here
[3:38:35] <aimlesshealer> You make me look like dogshit at DMC, I'm embarrassed to play now
