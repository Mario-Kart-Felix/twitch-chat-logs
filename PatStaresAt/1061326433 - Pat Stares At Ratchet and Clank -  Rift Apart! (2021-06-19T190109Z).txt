[0:13:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> Same thing as the Jedi dogma
[0:13:12] <%TheYellowcouch> hot nuns man
[0:13:13] <$SGrim> Constant repression and guilt leads to explosive personalities
[0:13:13] <%AzureGale> The more you try to restrict them, the more rebellious they become
[0:13:14] <$ItsRatman> Being repressed makes it more appealing
[0:13:19] <scrumbotime> If you tell someone that fucking will send them to hell it breaks something in there
[0:13:19] <%X2Eliah> wait french catholicism or english catholicism?
[0:13:20] <%thbluewarden> they are very repressed
[0:13:25] <%kyh9> CATHOLIC SCHOOOL GIRLS JUST WANTED TO DO THE MOST DANGEROUS SHIT
[0:13:26] <%JoshManVGH> Repression combined with rebellion.
[0:13:27] <dubstep_paladin> Catholic school is just horny jail?
[0:13:27] <%SaiyanShoto> I think it‚Äôs the repression
[0:13:29] <Dova573> Boredom and Horniness are dangerous duo
[0:13:30] <%maenos2> can confirm, ex is Catholic, she is REALLY kinky.
[0:13:36] <%kyh9> They were VERY dangerous for anyone who didn't want kids at 17
[0:13:53] <%JoshManVGH> "Don't do that" "I'm going to do all of that SO. HARD!"
[0:13:54] <%Bailey__gaming> YOU Knew sex freaks in highschool?!
[0:13:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> catholic is indeed horny jail
[0:13:57] <+Ghufufin> gotta eat that forbidden fruit
[0:14:04] <%thbluewarden> no need to worry if you're already saved
[0:14:12] <chimeraxmachina> Man catholic privat school sucked, they made us look at images of  abortions and went like ‚Äúbet you don‚Äôt want Fetusses to be ripped apart‚Äù

[0:27:59] <%YakumoYomi> Awww...that's wholesome
[0:28:00] <scrumbotime> Pat will grind when the grinding is just numbers.

[0:28:12] <CappuccinoGuil> Awwwww that's nice Pat, we enjoy seeing you bumble your way through games too.
[0:28:21] <+runegod20> the basic pistol is actually pretty damn good when upgraded

[0:48:18] <SuperChumps> I staffed a convention where Richard Horvitz was a guest. Got to spend a little time with the dude. He was super chill. Spent most of his down time recording custom voicemails for the staffers.

[0:49:06] <raikagelord1> Ratchet and clank have had to compete in a couple gladiator arenas. Dreadlock was on of my favorite games as a kid
[0:49:19] <%SolidusRex> Yes Dakuu75, yes actually
[0:49:21] <Virokwet> what fungis
[0:49:23] <+featherlan> I can't believe Insomniac is allowed to reference that game in a Sony title
[0:49:47] <%Dakuu75> @SolidusRex lol, nice.
[0:49:49] <%GalacticaPhanto> @featherlan they own the IP now
[0:50:00] <mistspade> @featherlan sony owns it now
[0:50:06] <+featherlan> YO, SUNSET OVERDRIVE SEQUEL???
[0:50:12] <%dankjerri> Mr. boivin is here to kill
[0:50:25] <+runegod20> and besides, it's just the cans and sound effects for picking them up, it's not too impossible to get
[0:50:30] <+MelodyMedley> @featherlan It's possible now
[0:50:35] <raikagelord1> @featherlan apparently their are a lot of references in this game also most ratchet and clank titles are Innuendos.
[0:50:40] <+featherlan> @dankjerri I see what you did there XS
[0:50:42] <+Javaa01> @featherlan Sony bought the Sunset Overdrive IP from Microsoft when they were busy buying Insomniac out
[0:50:52] <morningmoondude> Rift Apart tells me that Sony is giving Insomniac some blank fucking checks after Spider-mans
[0:50:55] <%AzureGale> We can always hope for Sunset Overdrive 2... someday
[0:50:56] <Laseki> this game is loaded with referances to other sony/insomniac games
[0:51:01] <+runegod20> i forget, can you upgrade the range for the topiary thing?
[0:51:04] <avidneptune> Microsoft never owned the IP
[0:51:12] <%SolidusRex> Support weapons are always the best in arenas
[0:51:13] <avidneptune> Insomniac owned it
[0:51:14] <arduousScavenger> He's collecting the amount of Red Bulls that Pat consumes on an average Tuesday.
[0:51:14] <+featherlan> @raikagelord1 I DID spoil myself slightly, and see how the RYNO in this game is, you aren't wrong there
[0:51:15] <%dankjerri> this makes me want to play Infamous

[1:03:16] <Daxalog> Oh wow they actually give you alot of ammo during the challanges these days
[1:03:22] <SlangPunk> This challenge on the hardest difficulty is wild
[1:03:26] <%hammerfell> the game gameplay int
[1:03:26] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the more I watch the more this kinda feels like doom but third person

[1:04:04] <RushUnplugged> sure would be great if Sonic had any good games past the 90s
[1:04:06] <avidneptune> They‚Äôre were better than the OG Sonic games
[1:04:06] <studleydoorite> Ratchet and Clank is a serious game for serious gamers, but not too serious
[1:04:06] <andrewofbob> Oh crap, tuned into the shotgun challenge
[1:04:12] <Brothermanhyll> Didn't pat have a whole twitter pubfight over this
[1:04:15] <%ssjklyco> Ratchet games focus on "Hey, let's make it fun" not "HEY GUYS, It's SONIC! YOU REMEMBER SONIC?"
[1:04:16] <andrewofbob> Hardest of all of them IMO
[1:04:18] <fairore> sa2 is a good game
[1:04:25] <%TheYellowcouch> It'S GREAT
[1:04:28] <%X2Eliah> Yeah just like Pixar
[1:04:32] <%AzureGale> It's okay, they're bad people
[1:04:32] <%TheYellowcouch> MORE MURDER PLEASE
[1:04:45] <$ItsRatman> No blood so it's all good
[1:04:52] <logothete2401> That is why Drakengard exists
[1:04:54] <SociopathicApe> People blew up and died in the Incredibles
[1:04:56] <+Dia_Dar> more murder for little timmy when the scalpers lay off the ps5
[1:04:59] <morningmoondude> Lombax: teehee *commits massacres cutely*
[1:04:59] <+tigerfang86> only EXTREME AMOUNTS OF EXPLOSION
[1:05:00] <%NateyBeak> robot gore
[1:05:02] <+tigerfang86> no blood though
[1:05:02] <%cvp5127> family friendly murder
[1:05:07] <Brothermanhyll> people get vaporized screaming all the time
[1:05:07] <%TheYellowcouch> They're just robots
[1:05:08] <avidneptune> Cartoons die too
[1:05:09] <%TheYellowcouch> it's fine
[1:05:10] <+runegod20> it's electricity so no scrapnel, it's all guchi
[1:05:13] <auraofdawn> they could all yell "I'M FINE" in theory
[1:05:14] <%TheYellowcouch> they don't have rights
[1:05:15] <%ComfortableStranger> genocide is fine as long as its robots
[1:05:19] <RushUnplugged> they're fiiiiine
[1:05:20] <AllenDeadman> good hustle

[1:06:22] <sonoheizen> Nah, it's easy.
[1:06:25] <%AzureGale> Okay this is cool
[1:06:32] <%TheMoenia> fun fact: the command and conquer games got around censorship in germany by replacing blood with oil and pretending all human units are actually robots

[1:06:40] <Brothermanhyll> PS5 flexxin
[1:06:41] <%AzureGale> NICE WORK DYING
[1:06:42] <sonoheizen> nvm
[1:06:42] <%AncelDeLambert> SHENANIGANS
[1:06:46] <logothete2401> There have been no loading screens in the entire game
[1:06:47] <+featherlan> @rathekingofthesun You got a PC? It's on Steam
[1:06:48] <studleydoorite> on my local Craigslist there's a listing for a PS5 it's just "Will only trade for a gun and ammunition. Comes with 2 controllers."
[1:06:57] <StarMechV> "Nice work back there!"
[1:07:00] <+MosesUnspoken> Insomniac writes their games the way Gearbox THINKS they write their games.
[1:07:05] <foxname96> Hello chat!!! What dank Lombussy shit i missed????
[1:07:05] <+murderof_crows> Dude, the orginal ps2 games where hard pg13 style games. From ps3 onward it went down to pg. it‚Äôs the writing and gameplay that makes it even better.
[1:07:09] <%AzureGale> Yeah that's a trap
[1:07:13] <$realm_forge> Try spinning! That‚Äôs a neat trick!
[1:07:13] <+tigerfang86> bepStare
[1:07:14] <AllenDeadman> wtf...
[1:07:14] <Virokwet> what
[1:07:15] <%Dakuu75> dafuq
[1:07:17] <%cvp5127> nice deal
[1:07:18] <+cascadepersona> @studleydoorite Sounds more reliable than Gamestop
[1:07:18] <%X2Eliah> wow
[1:07:20] <+tigerfang86> bepStare bepStare bepStare
[1:07:21] <SociopathicApe> Genius strat.
[1:07:22] <%X2Eliah> what a scam
[1:07:23] <crocboyz> thats a fucking setup
[1:07:23] <+Dia_Dar> @MosesUnspoken oof...that's a solid burn
[1:07:23] <Virokwet> hella sus
[1:07:24] <scrumbotime> Well, it's a good deal for one person.
[1:07:24] <morningmoondude> that's dangerous... but 2 controllers tho
[1:07:24] <Saltmeisterr> UHHH
[1:07:25] <%AzureGale> Guy's going to take the weapon AND the console
[1:07:25] <%SirGO0SE> comes with 2 controllers tho
[1:07:26] <Daxalog> Holy shit
[1:07:28] <%KetsuoTaberu> Trade for a gun and ammo that they will then rob you with
[1:07:30] <+runegod20> hey, a gun is much easier to find than a ps5 in the states
[1:07:30] <BlueLunecy> Two controllers you say
[1:07:31] <Profmcstevie> what if I USE the gun and TAKE the PS5
[1:07:32] <nomos42> is the ammunition a single bullet?
[1:07:34] <%Dakuu75> lol
[1:07:36] <%ssjklyco> THe buyer could just bring the gun and use the amunition to take the PS5
[1:07:37] <XeroSigmaPrime> Im so desperate for a PS5 tho...
[1:07:38] <chimeraxmachina> So the rift just happened and they are already integrating it into their blood sport? Loving the commitment
[1:07:42] <raikagelord1> That‚Äôs how you get robbed.
[1:07:42] <$realm_forge> Sounds like Texas
[1:07:42] <%MidnightBurst12> controllers are expensive
[1:07:46] <+rathekingofthesun> @featherlan nope. Nothing strong enough to handle games
[1:07:53] <%The_Protagonist> shoot the guy and then you'll have the gun and the PS5.
[1:07:55] <studleydoorite> I could get a gun and ammo for the retail price of a PS5 but the police may come looking for me later
[1:08:06] <Onionchamp> The price is probably comparable
[1:08:16] <%ssjklyco> It was wrong last time
[1:08:17] <scrumbotime> yeah but he didn't send you the first time
[1:08:18] <+featherlan> @rathekingofthesun Damn, sorry man; I do hope it comes to Playstation for ya
[1:08:18] <+BIumen> because the first time he got the wrong location
[1:08:18] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, it's a child
[1:08:19] <+rathekingofthesun> Damn. You could get 2 controllers for your first borne. That‚Äôs a good deal
[1:08:22] <heart_ablaze> I'm still in shock on how pretty this game is
[1:08:26] <BlueLunecy> Some real Jak and Daxter energy here
[1:08:27] <%Zeikier> he said it!
[1:08:28] <%The_Protagonist> he said the D word
[1:08:28] <StarMechV> The joke is he tried before and you ended up in the wrong place Pat
[1:08:29] <+featherlan> HE SAID IT
[1:08:29] <andrewofbob> The joke is that he says it then it doesn't happen
[1:08:29] <%Zeikier> he said the D word!
[1:08:31] <%AncelDeLambert> .... is that Zim?
[1:08:33] <+BIumen> yeah lmao

[1:10:50] <+runegod20> if i remember right, the final level of the starter pistol turns into spread shot that shoots 3 bullets for the price of one, which gives it stupid damage

[1:11:17] <%TheYellowcouch> Gieffy has sock GIEFFY IS FREE
[1:11:21] <foxname96> @legendfather_of_giants it just seems every time i tune in he plays as this shoehorned in rule 63 ratchet that exists for muh representation points. That's all. Didn't see much of Ratchet gameplay yet. besides very start of the game. Will you be able to at least switch at will later in the game???
[1:11:39] <brachydios777> Gief must consume what he surveys
[1:11:42] <+sixcubit> What Has He Done
[1:11:44] <%Zeikier> pchSip
[1:11:50] <Brothermanhyll> @foxname96 ResidentSleeper
[1:11:57] <+tigerfang86> have you considered that having other characters is good, maybe

[1:12:12] <Virokwet> aww what a lil troll
[1:12:14] <%AzureGale> Gief is like little baby dog
[1:12:16] <%YakumoYomi> My dog does that too. She'll even come find me to show that she has it.
[1:12:17] <+featherlan> Rivet is cool, wdym
[1:12:25] <studleydoorite> he wants you to chase him, you should hire a dog chaser
[1:12:28] <+tigerfang86> nice bait from that guy
[1:12:36] <+sermittens> Is that Sue from Chicago?
[1:12:40] <foxname96> I just wanted a new Good Ratchet game. Like PS2 ones but on PS5. Reboot was ATROCIOUS
[1:12:47] <Spoofy16> rivet is a cutie and im not even a furry
[1:12:59] <nomos42> Jebaited
[1:13:01] <+runegod20> being able to stun bosses for even a few seconds is pretty busted
[1:13:14] <+runegod20> and t hat's like level 1 without upgrades either
[1:13:18] <Brothermanhyll> I just assume Rivet is like Arbiter and you switch once in a while

[1:14:31] <XeroSigmaPrime> Carbonax is like the sickest armor design in the series, I'm glad they brought it back
[1:14:34] <+MelodyMedley> Isn't there more arena stuff?
[1:14:37] <+runegod20> that's cool rather than the preo rder skin only being available in preorder and either never shows up again, or is paid DLC
[1:14:45] <+MosesUnspoken> it unlocks later

[1:23:05] <chimeraxmachina> Does this game straight up have no load times? I haven‚Äôt noticed any so far
[1:23:10] <CappuccinoGuil> I LOVE YOU TRUDI
[1:23:11] <%AzureGale> Wait what's a zurpstone
[1:23:12] <+probably_facetious> Why would a cat be able to swim? They don't need to swim to hunt rats (which can't swim)
[1:23:13] <AllenDeadman> that's a weird dog
[1:23:15] <%X2Eliah> Is that just Pat and Paige
[1:23:24] <+ipaintwithcolor> this game looks cool
[1:23:26] <SomeAsianDood> Is Mort supposed to be space canadian?
[1:23:27] <brachydios777> Morts are space canadians, right?
[1:23:32] <Brothermanhyll> I saw a loadtime that was about 1 sec, maybe one and a half

[1:24:02] <+fugatlas> @PatStaresAt there are Zurps that seem unobtainable: aim on the ones that make sense first, when you hit a threshold the weird ones become obtainable

[1:24:10] <+probably_facetious> @azuregale It's just what Trudi needs.

[1:24:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt that's where it starts
[1:24:21] <%bevyrage> put fungal back on the first wheel
[1:24:22] <%AzureGale> Yeah pages is a great addition to the series
[1:24:26] <+fugatlas> my brain made me try to get one of the unobtainable ones for an hour before i googled it and realized there are some you just can't get at first
[1:24:27] <Brothermanhyll> This whole game is just PS5 flexing
[1:24:37] <Afterman_> no
[1:24:41] <Afterman_> thats the planet atmosphere
[1:24:46] <%MegboyManuel> this entire game looks pixar
[1:24:53] <%sjay662> zurping system
[1:24:53] <brachydios777> there is?
[1:24:55] <CappuccinoGuil> After playing Sunset Overdrive, I've learned Insomniac really loves making tons of weapons in their shooters
[1:24:57] <%sjay662> big zurps
[1:24:58] <Profmcstevie> Bold of you to think I can see shit through twitch
[1:24:59] <$FriedMattato> It's JUST you Pat. No one else is like this
[1:24:59] <andrewofbob> I thought Astro's Playroom is the full-on flex
[1:25:02] <foxname96> Low res bushes. PS5 to the max LUL KEKW LUL
[1:25:04] <+runegod20> it has giant acid lakes, i assume it'd make stuff look weird

[1:25:42] <%AzureGale> Oh this is the open-ended planet
[1:25:43] <+runegod20> for the bit i played of sunset with my free month of gamepass, i'm amazed by how many weapons the game had, though it feels like it'd take alot to grind for them
[1:25:47] <$FriedMattato> Morts are Pat crossed with Zangief
[1:25:48] <chimeraxmachina> Cuuuute

[1:26:03] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh lord, icons errywhere
[1:26:04] <iosephe> zurp it up
[1:26:05] <+probably_facetious> ZURPOCALYPSE

[1:26:06] <Afterman_> the goblins begin to plot
[1:26:07] <+tigerfang86> Goblins have AWAKENED
[1:26:08] <+TechnicolorNinja> Gotta get that zurp
[1:26:15] <+yoshkosh20> I wasn't here for the first stream. do you choose who to play between ratchet and rivet, or do you change chars depending on the mission/story progression?
[1:26:21] <%sjay662> If you collect some as Rivet, and then play Rachet.... It's the zurping system
[1:26:24] <CappuccinoGuil> @AzureGale Joke's on you, THIS IS WHAT I LOVE WATCHING.
[1:26:24] <%tinyswampthing> tinyswampthing subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 38 months! 
[1:26:28] <brachydios777> Am I right to assume this is the best Ratchet and Clank game so far?
[1:26:30] <%cvp5127> zurpussy
[1:26:31] <+gitgouda> the goblin horde cometh
[1:26:37] <%X2Eliah> That zurp in that lomburp
[1:26:41] <+KingKrampus> @yoshkosh20 alternates between the two
[1:26:44] <morningmoondude> go back when you get 30, then again when you get 45
[1:26:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt then you get to 60, but you unlock somehting after getting 30 that makes collecting the rest easier
[1:26:52] <+rathekingofthesun> Zurpussy 2021
[1:26:57] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat to save you some time, the ones that seem like they are unobtainable (in a weird high spot) are, until you collect the rest you can reach.
[1:27:00] <+runegod20> @yoshkosh20 they each have their own planets that they play on, so if pat decided to go back to the first planet, the game would switch to ratchet, or if he goes back to the battle arena, it changes back to rivit
[1:27:04] <AllenDeadman> we're an RTS now
[1:27:08] <CappuccinoGuil> God damn, Fungi is disgusting. I love it
[1:27:11] <%AzureGale> But Pat you are throwing away XP when you use max leveled weapons. jk
[1:27:14] <morningmoondude> The Fungussy
[1:27:14] <+Exicuren> Dayum
[1:27:15] <%bevyrage> use 'em for boss fights
[1:27:22] <%sjay662> Mr Fungi, go home and be a family man
[1:27:25] <+yoshkosh20> gotcha, thanks @KingKrampus @runegod20
[1:27:31] <%AzureGale> Is this guy watching you 24/7
[1:27:33] <%X2Eliah> Chat is correct, you are losing weapon EXP when you use Fungi
[1:27:39] <notsoy> that would be rad if a maxed-out weapon distributed the XP to your other weapons
[1:27:52] <StarMechV> RELATABLE

[1:28:35] <%X2Eliah> @OneGorillionDollars eh you know, not all canadians and such
[1:28:36] <%Broand> RYNO you say?
[1:28:38] <%topendbuzza> heck we need the spybot
[1:28:39] <Profmcstevie> Ryno you saaaaay
[1:28:40] <+MosesUnspoken> LETS GO
[1:28:44] <%AzureGale> FLYING MOUNT GET
[1:28:45] <+featherlan> It's RYNO TIME
[1:28:45] <Daxalog> RYNO huh. Welp
[1:28:46] <andrewofbob> Ride the dragon
[1:28:46] <+FoolsArcade> FLYING?
[1:28:47] <$SGrim> Flying mount!
[1:28:47] <+MelodyMedley> Nice
[1:28:51] <+Exicuren> EVEN easier
[1:28:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> They outright said RYNO after trying to keep it secret earlier
[1:28:57] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Automatically take you there I hope
[1:29:00] <+runegod20> i mean, she lives in a cave but it's a decked out cave, it's not just a mattress on rocks
[1:29:01] <Profmcstevie> Unreached islands, winged creature, HMMM hboxEyes
[1:29:01] <brachydios777> That thing is cool
[1:29:01] <devanmuse> RYNO is the best weapon is every game, holy shit
[1:29:05] <%JoshManVGH> You can fly around the map!
[1:29:16] <%Dakuu75> I'm lovin g the black'n yellow. very x-man
[1:29:18] <Spoofy16> do those come in gamer colors
[1:29:23] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt VERY IMPORTANT PAT: You can't get all the Zurp right away. You need to grab all the ones on the ground before the game gives the dragon the ability to shoot down the ones in high places. THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU THIS AND A LOT OF OTHER LPERS GET STUCK IN HERE FOR HOURS
[1:29:40] <+MosesUnspoken> YUP
[1:29:44] <+BIumen> yeah i feel that
[1:29:45] <AllenDeadman> huh
[1:29:47] <%cvp5127> yep
[1:29:48] <ThatGuyThere03> good tips
[1:29:51] <+fugatlas> the threshold is 45
[1:29:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> I GOT STUCK THERE
[1:29:55] <%HunguyTV> Not hours but happened to me too
[1:29:55] <+SocialMisfitGamer> So just do it offscreen
[1:29:57] <andrewofbob> Pfft, I just use the broken dash to climb up anyway
[1:29:59] <%AzureGale> That is actually a good one
[1:30:00] <morningmoondude> very good teip
[1:30:01] <%radregice> oh i guess this is the big collectathon iteration for this game
[1:30:06] <%X2Eliah> zurp zurp zurp
[1:30:07] <+rathekingofthesun> Good chat
[1:30:14] <+runegod20> thankfully they're all marked on the map right away which helps alot
[1:30:20] <chimeraxmachina> Aw good advice
[1:30:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @radregice not really, it takes like 15 minutes tops
[1:30:30] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:30:33] <CappuccinoGuil> Awww that's cute, you get extra dialogue revisiting boss arenas
[1:30:40] <%Dakuu75> OH shit! there's damage numbers?!
[1:30:42] <%tinyswampthing> yep and if you didnt collect all the ones in the first place you get them in those remains hidden on the map
[1:30:45] <morningmoondude> the dragon shooting fire also collects teh zurp
[1:30:52] <brachydios777> was that a pin ball gun?
[1:30:53] <+runegod20> yeah, this part isn't actually as long as you'd think
[1:31:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Dakuu75 that's a bonus you get for collecting gold bolts
[1:31:19] <T_Sasquatch> Murder :)
[1:31:23] <%cvp5127> get the bolt
[1:31:33] <%X2Eliah> A different game would have these collectibles not visible on the map and not highlighted on the hud
[1:31:35] <%sjay662> fun and not annoying?
[1:31:50] <%ssjklyco> Don't forget, they are the same people who did the recent Spidermans
[1:31:51] <+zuzuxiv> wtf is this drakengard
[1:31:55] <%tinyswampthing> the teddy bears arent on the map though
[1:32:00] <morningmoondude> just like with Spider-man. Insomniac's really good at making 100%ing a game reasonable.
[1:32:01] <%cvp5127> get the bolt in the sky
[1:32:05] <+runegod20> having each bolt give you a mini bonus right away rather than having to collect a certain amount to unlock stuff helps too
[1:32:05] <%tinyswampthing> i really wish they were
[1:32:18] <+rathekingofthesun> I hope there‚Äôs a dev room like in past games
[1:32:20] <T_Sasquatch> @x2eliah ac feathers LUL
[1:32:26] <+MosesUnspoken> LUL
[1:32:30] <%AzureGale> DED
[1:32:30] <+Zeromaru2> not that
[1:32:32] <andrewofbob> She's basically a taxi at this point
[1:32:54] <AllenDeadman> it's great for crowd control
[1:33:03] <+fugatlas> im a fan of any ratchet weapon that gives a DOT
[1:33:07] <%JoshManVGH> A lot of weapons in this game clearly fuck.
[1:33:11] <+fugatlas> lava stream best gun
[1:33:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt these guys spawn infititely, just get the stones
[1:33:40] <+runegod20> i don't think they're infinitely
[1:33:43] <%ssjklyco> They do not
[1:33:45] <%JoshManVGH> Nah they don't
[1:33:45] <andrewofbob> They don't
[1:33:47] <morningmoondude> ONE GUY
[1:33:48] <AllenDeadman> one guy
[1:33:50] <%watchmanfury> rekt
[1:33:51] <%Bane_Kaikyo> .... ONE GUY
[1:33:51] <+MosesUnspoken> one guy
[1:33:54] <SomeAsianDood> ONE GUY
[1:33:54] <%xmetalicdemonx> one guy
[1:33:55] <%bevyrage> the only infinite spawns in a rachet & clank game are from spawners
[1:33:55] <andrewofbob> If they did, that would be infinite xp
[1:33:55] <AmericanaRed> im sure
[1:33:55] <%Dfreddy8> psaCrazyhead
[1:33:56] <%TheYellowcouch> CRAZY TALK FOR CHAT
[1:33:56] <T_Sasquatch> Maybe. Maybe not
[1:33:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah, thats on me
[1:33:57] <Profmcstevie> Wrong? Hm? Couldit be?
[1:33:59] <brachydios777> he is not
[1:34:00] <%AzureGale> Spoke too soon
[1:34:01] <Laseki> they dont respawn
[1:34:05] <%Broand> Singular person

[1:34:40] <%Dakuu75> reminds me of that one guy who got timed out but, right before he was like "I deserve that"
[1:34:40] <brachydios777> Press X to doubt
[1:34:42] <+cascadepersona> Pat: Barely contained
[1:34:44] <%ChrisPlaysThing> LUL
[1:34:49] <NaberiustheNefarious> PJs are for storing meat
[1:34:57] <%X2Eliah> They kinda are fishnets, you just have really red legs
[1:35:02] <+rathekingofthesun> Pat: love sausage
[1:35:05] <%TheYellowcouch> Pat dicks at
[1:35:09] <%sjay662> @PatStaresAt once you hit 45 you can get the ones high up
[1:35:10] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Call my PJs the meat locker
[1:35:11] <+fugatlas> it almost feels like they didn't tell players about the dragon fire breathing so that they'd spend more time here /s
[1:35:14] <+MosesUnspoken> 6 more
[1:35:21] <+runegod20> i've never liked weapons in games that requires you to charge them down before you fire
[1:35:22] <morningmoondude> Love it when you're about o level up and the XP bar is THROBBING
[1:35:23] <Saltmeisterr> @foxname96 its a cosmetic
[1:35:26] <%X2Eliah> gaah
[1:35:27] <Profmcstevie> no plot reason, just a silly thing you can toggle with cheat unlocks
[1:35:27] <Brothermanhyll> The plot reason is a skin that Pat has enabled
[1:35:33] <Daxalog> @foxname96 He used a secret bolt to change them.
[1:35:38] <%X2Eliah> every time she speaks, I swear it sounds like Paige

[1:36:09] <NaberiustheNefarious> what do you think about forced accents in games
[1:36:17] <%thedankestmeeme> sorry, no open cell here
[1:36:21] <TinalaCoakes> If your dick had a fighting-game-move name what would it be?
[1:36:29] <+KingKrampus> THE MEGATRON COLLIDER??
[1:36:43] <+runegod20> yeah, why can't everyone be natural and speak in an american accent like a normal person
[1:36:44] <brachydios777> Oh god that does sound a little like Paige

[1:38:53] <RinWR> Shoties
[1:38:58] <Saltmeisterr> no johns
[1:38:59] <SpaceGuntank> "sex kicks" is my favorite funny Smash term
[1:39:00] <+PkSilent01> Scrimblo Blimblo is my favorite character
[1:39:01] <StarMechV> Scrimblo vs Anime McSwordsman
[1:39:03] <+Shacklebox> Kid fuckies
[1:39:03] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> lolololol he got timed out xD
[1:39:04] <NaberiustheNefarious> bruh my fundies are mad good i be schomovin
[1:39:05] <%TheYellowcouch> Sounds like a whole lot of Joe
[1:39:15] <+runegod20> aww, we skipped out on tyheir dialogue
[1:39:16] <TinalaCoakes> sex kick is definately up there
[1:39:17] <Saltmeisterr> that fucking shoto discussion was so funny
[1:39:18] <+Shacklebox> Pedophillies
[1:39:24] <karovus> it sounds like a fake work along the lines of ligma or one of those
[1:39:25] <%X2Eliah> I still cannot get over smash players saying "shoto" (or w/e) to mean "other game chars"
[1:39:33] <Hippoleon> Sounds like you're just mad that you got hit by too many Mamma Mias
[1:39:36] <+cascadepersona> It came from Kheyehm's Stream of Balan Wonderworld and KZ, Feel, and everyone else ran with it
[1:39:53] <Brothermanhyll> @X2Eliah I still cannot get over smash players
[1:39:54] <+KingKrampus> @x2eliah Smash players do what now
[1:39:54] <Saltmeisterr> its not as bad as ROA having a official competitive term called the BONER FART
[1:39:57] <%TheYellowcouch> a real good Ricochet you would say?
[1:40:05] <brachydios777> Remember how Smash fans have no idea what a shoto is?
[1:40:17] <andrewofbob> It's that Luigi is actually a shoto that makes the argument even more crazy
[1:40:20] <%topendbuzza> sigh when will jak get love like this on the ps5?
[1:40:33] <+MosesUnspoken> time to fly
[1:40:35] <%bevyrage> BIG XP
[1:40:36] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt killinmg grunthors gets you Raritanium
[1:40:36] <ThatGuyThere03> @brachydios777 You mean people who ONLY play Smash
[1:40:38] <%AzureGale> I thought Bonerfarts was from Borderlands 2 :x
[1:40:39] <morningmoondude> Go back and Trudy can shoot fire
[1:40:50] <+runegod20> gunters drop like 3 raratanium each, good farmings
[1:40:52] <brachydios777> Yes
[1:40:55] <Profmcstevie> Jak and Daxter will NEVER find a developer that can do it justice sugoiAwawa
[1:40:55] <+MosesUnspoken> you can get the high ones now
[1:40:56] <morningmoondude> TASER THAT GRUNTHOR
[1:41:01] <Brothermanhyll> custom animations
[1:41:03] <+fugatlas> KEEP THEM DOT'S UP
[1:41:05] <%Blackleafx> haha health bar go BRRRRRRR
[1:41:05] <%Dakuu75> damn nigh, stun-locked
[1:41:11] <s1rcuit> @topendbuzza never, since they wrapped up the story in 3
[1:41:14] <morningmoondude> tasing his taint
[1:41:19] <+cascadepersona> @topendbuzza I don't think Naughty Dog is gonna go back to Jak and Daxter with their current output
[1:41:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Has pat bothered to even attempt to make the basic pistol better?
[1:41:25] <+rathekingofthesun> Stronk tazer
[1:41:27] <%AzureGale> I'm still waiting for an Uncharted kart racer from Naughty Dog :x
[1:41:29] <brachydios777> Now that's alot of damage!
[1:41:34] <TinalaCoakes> Ok but isn't shoto also a stupid obscure term made by a silly community?
[1:41:41] <%dio96> @AzureGale Unkarted.
[1:41:41] <%AzureGale> They could call it... Unkarted
[1:41:41] <+vaderxyz1970> Can you imagine using the nuetron colored on a rathalos
[1:41:43] <%Delenay> thats a nifty way of raising the damage counter, just moving the middle digit
[1:41:44] <%X2Eliah> @Bane_Kaikyo why? he already killed a boss with it
[1:41:50] <morningmoondude> @Bane_Kaikyo No. But I beat teh game and it's not fucking worth it.
[1:41:52] <+fugatlas> @AzureGale uncharted jeep racing
[1:41:55] <%sjay662> it levels up fast
[1:41:57] <s1rcuit> it could be
[1:41:57] <%X2Eliah> lvl 5 is good
[1:42:00] <%topendbuzza> it gets better
[1:42:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> at max, it gets crazy, but its not good now, no
[1:42:02] <+featherlan> Y'know, I hope we get another R&C game like Into the Nexus; as short as that game was, I think it's one of the better entries, especially in terms of writing
[1:42:02] <+MajorCrasher> the basic pistol is actually incredible fully upgraded
[1:42:03] <%ssjklyco> It's decent
[1:42:03] <%sjay662> and becomes a triple shot
[1:42:03] <Coin2Play> actually a cool kids game wow
[1:42:04] <+cascadepersona> There are better weapons than the starting pistol
[1:42:06] <+ScrapKingKeita> generally speaking the pistols just level up super fast
[1:42:07] <%TheMoenia> im gonna be honest, that dodge animation kinda fucks with my brain and makes me want to barf
[1:42:08] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt arguably the best gun in the game fully upgraded
[1:42:09] <Saltmeisterr> it seems ok leveled up
[1:42:11] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Da spoilers
[1:42:11] <+runegod20> when upgraded it turns into a triple shot pistol for the price of one bullet with tons of damage with the headshots
[1:42:14] <%TheYellowcouch> Yeah needs more updog
[1:42:15] <andrewofbob> Upgraded pistol has a split-shot when fast, and there are dps upgrades
[1:42:20] <StarMechV> The raritanium upgrades turn it into a beast
[1:42:25] <Profmcstevie> Upgrade anything on the chance it become good
[1:42:27] <+Ghufufin> if u suffer enuff it becum OK
[1:42:29] <+tigerfang86> free window!!!
[1:42:33] <%xmetalicdemonx> It has helped in tight spots when everything else ran out of ammo. Just an observation
[1:42:34] <+tigerfang86> that's a free window babyyyyyyy
[1:42:37] <Kain5707> does it become dualies like the the other games?
[1:42:38] <morningmoondude> I don't agree, the full upgrade is fun but runs otu of ammo too fast to do good shit
[1:42:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt it also levels up way faster
[1:42:43] <%sjay662> @PatStaresAt you can get the ones up high now
[1:42:45] <+fugatlas> go get on trudie, you've passed the threshold you need to make the dragon breath fire
[1:42:47] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Ok nevermind.... I only asked because in previous games the basic pistol and shotguns improve drastically with upgrades and stay relevant
[1:42:50] <tpindustriesV> will they be bringing back groovitron?
[1:42:50] <%Ipsenscastle> SAME
[1:42:50] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[1:42:50] <%X2Eliah> ?
[1:42:54] <Brothermanhyll> From Star Fox Adventures??
[1:42:55] <+fugatlas> with that ability you can clean the rest of these up in like 5 minutes
[1:42:57] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:42:59] <%X2Eliah> "bath mo dad"?
[1:42:59] <+tigerfang86> @PatStaresAt DUM DEE DUM
[1:43:00] <tanarath> bafmodad

[1:43:02] <Saltmeisterr> BAFMODAD
[1:43:07] <%Ipsenscastle> collect 5 billion bafmodads
[1:43:09] <+sixcubit> think about it this way: max it out and you can remove it from your wheel forever
[1:43:10] <+KingKrampus> @patstaresat that's because a lot of this level has Star Fox Adventures but GOOD vibes
[1:43:10] <%bevyrage> does it have any upgrades though?
[1:43:14] <spuginky> that word has never left my mind
[1:43:14] <$SirGO0SE> bafmobussy
[1:43:15] <andrewofbob> Dragon has GUN
[1:43:17] <+runegod20> a upgraded pistol can kill a gruntor in like less than a minute easy

[1:43:32] <RinWR> Angelus?
[1:43:37] <%justcallmebobplease> Every time I tab back over this game remains a Pixar movie, it's pretty incredible
[1:43:37] <+Ghufufin> turns out the gun was inside the dragon all along
[1:43:39] <%bevyrage> are those tie fighter shot sound effects?
[1:43:39] <AllenDeadman> dragon gastritis is something else
[1:43:40] <s1rcuit> @PatStaresAt Bafmodad was the phoenix down in Starfox Adventures

[1:44:15] <%AzureGale> You wasted the XP
[1:44:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @RinWR yes, actually
[1:44:17] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Dragun
[1:44:17] <+ScrapKingKeita> the Dra-Gun
[1:44:19] <AllenDeadman> dragun
[1:44:20] <+cascadepersona> Drag-on Dragoon
[1:44:21] <+tigerfang86> absolute RUBE
[1:44:21] <nomos42> dra un
[1:44:21] <%Delenay> or does it?
[1:44:22] <s1rcuit> damn, Trudy is his planet's apex predator
[1:44:24] <astroasis> drag on dragoon
[1:44:24] <+runegod20> upgrading the dragon gave it hte gun in the first place
[1:44:38] <andrewofbob> Gun levelling is gun, but it's SO gobliny
[1:44:42] <andrewofbob> fun*
[1:44:46] <+runegod20> the basic pistol becomes good just for how good the ammo of it is
[1:44:47] <%valriot> Dragon these nuts on your face huehue
[1:44:50] <%topendbuzza> shoot heads now
[1:44:51] <brachydios777> Mario is more of a shoto than Kazuya
[1:44:59] <%bevyrage> that wasn't the burst pistol?
[1:45:06] <%bevyrage> was it?
[1:45:07] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> whaddya know deault gun is big shoot
[1:45:08] <notsoy> luigi is more of a shoto than mario
[1:45:13] <Brothermanhyll> what a mysterious shoto
[1:45:15] <andrewofbob> Area for later
[1:45:15] <%topendbuzza> it was
[1:45:22] <%legendfather_of_giants> you don't yet
[1:45:23] <+BIumen> its a later thing
[1:45:25] <SomeAsianDood> ken is more a shoto than kazuya
[1:45:27] <%bevyrage> huh, looked different
[1:45:33] <s1rcuit> I just noticed the spent casings rolling on the ground
[1:45:35] <+runegod20> well old mario was more of a shoto than current mario since he has fluud now
[1:45:39] <%bevyrage> ken IS a shoto though
[1:45:40] <TinalaCoakes> Shoto can do both fire and ice :D
[1:45:49] <%AzureGale> Fox is more of a shoto than Kazuya
[1:45:55] <%TheYellowcouch> like when we finally got flying in ARR
[1:46:02] <Brothermanhyll> This whole game feels like "who gives a shit, engine can handle it"
[1:46:05] <+RowenCleric> screw it make it drakengard
[1:46:05] <morningmoondude> POWER OF THE SSD yadda yadda
[1:46:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Yeah, if memory serves, Rachet and Clank like to make the Default gun remain relevant throughout the game.... so I suspected the pistol would be deceptively good
[1:46:16] <brachydios777> Ryu and Ken are the original shotos
[1:46:17] <%bevyrage> shoto is what, projectile, body projectile, and DP right?
[1:46:25] <+MajorCrasher> Mr. game and watch is more of a shot than Kazuya
[1:46:36] <+MajorCrasher> fuck
[1:46:37] <+Ghufufin> have they gone mad with ENGINE POWA?
[1:46:39] <Profmcstevie> Sony devs are big on biting off more than they can chew then inventing shit to make it work
[1:46:40] <%SirGO0SE> is lasagna a shoto?
[1:46:45] <morningmoondude> gold bolt to ther ight
[1:46:46] <%Broand> GOLD BOLT ON THE RIGHT
[1:46:47] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> do not bulli the lizer
[1:46:48] <%sjay662> gold bolt on your right
[1:46:51] <%topendbuzza> gold bolt in ring
[1:46:56] <SomeAsianDood> no but mayonaise is @SirGO0SE
[1:46:56] <+unsolvedAnomalies> the whole game is actually a miniature and it's just clever camera tricks
[1:47:02] <RinWR> @bevyrage Projectile, DP, advancing kick (Tatsu, spinning bird)
[1:47:08] <TinalaCoakes> If we're being real shoto is a silly made up term made by a bunch of nerds.
[1:47:10] <Saltmeisterr> blind pat

[1:47:13] <+PkSilent01> Hey Pat just want to say thanks for getting me into to Disco Elysium. On the first day I was able to meet with Evart because I passed the parkour check to get my jacket. I also spec into a sorry cop who is into Communism AND Fascism.

[2:00:41] <clockworknait1> I see the animations are as ... lively as the remake lol
[2:00:54] <%Ipsenscastle> @radregice LUL guess I just drifted away there, thanks!
[2:00:59] <chimeraxmachina> I‚Äôm utter trash but Gary is kinda hot? I hate this
[2:01:16] <+psychotripstreams> Genocide over tax returns. Got it.
[2:01:25] <+tigerfang86> dont hurt the morts usedV
[2:01:26] <Brothermanhyll> Mort is a key member?
[2:01:29] <+katarjin> R&C ..making new furrys ...yes
[2:01:30] <+fugatlas> fun thing: Gary's race is the goons 4 less race, just in this universe they're chill instead of having murder boners
[2:01:35] <CappuccinoGuil> @chimeraxmachina no no, your gut is right, he IS hot
[2:01:42] <%legendfather_of_giants> yeah, Sargasso is a callback to the PS3 games
[2:01:43] <+KingKrampus> tidus!
[2:01:46] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> this place has the color palette of the new metroid suit
[2:01:49] <+ThomasOfTroy> Minus the genocide
[2:01:53] <+psychotripstreams> ....I know this is a joke but I'm black and I cant with that shit XD
[2:01:54] <%valriot> LUL LUL
[2:01:54] <+Zeromaru2> Sound like the kind of thing IRS would do to everyone but the rich
[2:01:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Revolutionary war not civil war
[2:01:57] <+vaderxyz1970> that was about "states rights"
[2:02:03] <%MidnightBurst12> ah yes, the Great Tax War
[2:02:10] <TinalaCoakes> @ReallyBigRocks tomato potato
[2:02:10] <dashwallkick> uhhhh the...civil war?
[2:02:18] <XeroSigmaPrime> REvolutionary war, not civil XD
[2:02:18] <+alphonseisbest> @psychotripstreams yea Pat's that guy
[2:02:18] <+digital_gambitt> Wrong war, but close
[2:02:26] <%AzureGale> You sure killed that guy
[2:02:26] <%tinyswampthing> pat dont the us education system any ideas
[2:02:31] <brachydios777> Also that slavery thing, but mostly tax returns
[2:02:33] <TinalaCoakes> Is there even a difference?
[2:02:34] <Profmcstevie> Pat would you kill for dank Monster
[2:02:40] <Animeshowfan> i love how your able to collect the sodas from sunset overdrive its amazing
[2:02:42] <+psychotripstreams> I think Pat confused the civil war with the revolutionary war XD
[2:02:43] <tanarath> @patstaresat for rich people's tax returns specifically. poor people couldn't afford tea & the colonies were tax free
[2:02:47] <%ShogunNoonto> Is Pat and pretty sure that was mostly Slave owners not wanting to give up their slaves
[2:02:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> You haven't really tested the pistol since upgrading it
[2:02:55] <+fugatlas> ah yes, the time honored tradition of "but was the civil war REALLY about" discourse. I'll break out the popcorn
[2:02:58] <avidneptune> I mean it was technically a civil war
[2:03:00] <Giant_Ham> Reminds me of the pick ups in Sunset overdrive
[2:03:03] <fruit_pie_the_magician> smacks of death stranding
[2:03:05] <%watchmanfury> no that was world war 1
[2:03:10] <CappuccinoGuil> You do know those energy drinks are from a game, right?
[2:03:10] <%legendfather_of_giants> I mean, it was for monetary reasons
[2:03:12] <Kain5707> KEKW
[2:03:13] <romc215> Makes it feel like sunset overdrive
[2:03:14] <clockworknait1> I hate the change and it looks like they did it because they are easier on the system
[2:03:14] <%MidnightBurst12> "on purpose"
[2:03:15] <+ThomasOfTroy> Suuuure
[2:03:16] <%AzureGale> UM ACKTUALLY

[2:04:00] <TinalaCoakes> @PatStaresAt So you just did the "Haha I was merely pretending to be stupid!"?
[2:04:02] <Profmcstevie> I'm either a genius or I'm baiting psaSmug
[2:04:13] <+psychotripstreams> Pat's the realest Canadian I know.

[2:04:47] <peyodogo> your balls arent on stream if you show them on purpose is what you're sayin. yeah, checks out
[2:04:49] <+psychotripstreams> Was Sunset Overdrive any good? I barely remember that one
[2:04:52] <TinalaCoakes> also didn't mean that with snark or anything. Just poking fun. Americans are silly.
[2:04:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I guess who needs basic bitch pistol when lightning gun do THAT
[2:04:57] <studleydoorite> starFrogOnHead_UN
[2:04:58] <+fugatlas> damage numbers is the single best addition to the game, it make the brain chemicals go bit up
[2:04:58] <%MidnightBurst12> y'all ever fuck up your entire vocabulary for a bit?

[2:06:48] <%SolidusRex> I both love and hate how the troopers laugh whenever they hit you
[2:06:54] <+psychotripstreams> ...huh.
[2:06:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @TheMoenia she's also jacked, her arm is beefy
[2:07:04] <%sjay662> better than unobtanium

[2:09:29] <%GalacticaPhanto> @notsoy yeyeyeyeyeye you knew where I was going with it
[2:09:30] <CappuccinoGuil> Why do we like Sonic when we have this????
[2:09:31] <+Shillk> this is genuinely the coolest upgrade in the game

[2:09:40] <+Kango234> @radregice That remake was bafflingly disappointing.
[2:09:40] <%Dakuu75> I am, I am all of me~
[2:09:40] <+cascadepersona> It is my favorite part of the game right there
[2:09:41] <+tigerfang86> LMAO

[2:09:42] <SilverFaustX> ooooo

[2:09:43] <ThatGuyThere03> INDEED

[2:09:44] <+Zeromaru2> LUL
[2:09:45] <RinWR> @psychotripstreams Ever heard of grooming
[2:09:47] <%caramelatte1> Fun mechanics in video games? What is this madness?
[2:09:49] <%MajorCrasher> no
[2:09:53] <SomeAsianDood> indeed
[2:09:53] <KUYAmoPESh> Sonic Gamez with gunzzz
[2:09:57] <%RabbiKing> well no it'd be a good shadow game
[2:09:58] <+fugatlas> HIT THAT THPS GAP
[2:09:58] <%legendfather_of_giants> OMG ratchet has totally used Chaos Control on   the PS3
[2:09:59] <%AzureGale> DO IT DO IT DO IT DO IT
[2:10:02] <+alphonseisbest> sadly no
[2:10:03] <romc215> We'll never have a good sonic game ever again
[2:10:05] <%Ipsenscastle> Sega should just license Sonic out to a competent dev
[2:10:08] <%MajorCrasher> I literally can't imagine a good 3d sonic game
[2:10:08] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> MUSIC
[2:10:08] <+cascadepersona> Insomniac made a better Shadow the Hedgehog game in the year 2021
[2:10:10] <+BIumen> time for sonic
[2:10:12] <TinalaCoakes> Robo Blast 2 is great. Ive legit beaten it like 20 times by now.
[2:10:13] <Laseki> @PatStaresAt wanna do something fun? Look in diagonally at a flat wall or rail then actuvate the hoverboots and swing your wrench
[2:10:19] <+KingKrampus> quiet pat you want a teleporter in your intestines
[2:10:19] <%MidnightBurst12> @rinwr oh no
[2:10:22] <%GalacticaPhanto> @ipsenscastle Like they did with Mania
[2:10:22] <+psychotripstreams> I was just about to say this must be what a big budget sonic game is supposed to feel like
[2:10:24] <brachydios777> Generations was alright
[2:10:24] <+MosesUnspoken> never stop boosting
[2:10:33] <%radregice> @KingKrampus obviously its an early ps2 game so its not like the writing was anything stellar but I thought they at least gave him some development in the original
[2:10:41] <tpindustriesV> that looks like the ship from Wild Wild West
[2:10:43] <%Ipsenscastle> @GalacticaPhanto the one good modern Sonic game - absolutely, yes
[2:10:52] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Katy
[2:10:55] <+ScrapKingKeita> Oh, so she's Katie
[2:10:57] <+fugatlas> fun fact, R1 has been a sprint button the entire game even though the tutorial says its L3, it just switches to being boots when you get them.
[2:11:01] <%sjay662> LORBS

[2:12:41] <+FoolsArcade> feels like they're doing a zelda here
[2:12:46] <andrewofbob> It's like Ratchet's Sargasso
[2:12:54] <+brightman42> good thing you got those hover boots
[2:12:57] <%Dakuu75> @brachydios777 Oh, I like that.
[2:12:59] <+fugatlas> welcome to ratchet and clank: all range mode
[2:13:05] <emMmDeeKay> this is basicaly better shadow the heghehog now
[2:13:09] <%AzureGale> Guys they've done open world fields in R&C before
[2:13:14] <chimeraxmachina> The art direction in this game is so  g o o d
[2:13:15] <Thepothero> Love how meaty the levels are
[2:13:16] <tpindustriesV> there will be so many ring outs
[2:13:19] <%kyh9> when did Shadow the Hedgehog 2 come out?
[2:13:31] <andrewofbob> 2 and 3 had open areas too
[2:13:32] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[2:13:33] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 13m.
[2:13:41] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt there was a level like this in 2 & in 3, Pat
[2:13:43] <+alphonseisbest> that was more like open Space
[2:13:45] <%kyh9> I AM ALL OF ME
[2:13:47] <%GalacticaPhanto> wait is there a damage number toggle?
[2:13:51] <Dova573> When did we get female Clank?
[2:13:54] <+featherlan> Into the Nexus also had open-world portions
[2:13:54] <+fugatlas> the desert in RC2 was a nightmare of an open world zone
[2:13:55] <RinWR> Look like the things from that Stephen King movie
[2:13:59] <%kyh9> I'm sorry, I can not see anything other than Shadow in those jet boots
[2:14:00] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So you collect toilet paper?
[2:14:03] <+EcoFreak07> The worst part about this game. Is how blatantly unintentionally it points out that Insomniac is just as awesome as they used to be if not better... and Naughty Dog is just...... yeah.
[2:14:04] <%MajorCrasher> MajorCrasher subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! I will be mildly disappointed if this game doesn't end with lombussy.
[2:14:04] <avidneptune> There‚Äôs been an open world level every so often
[2:14:06] <$KnightAsteran> @GalacticaPhanto its a gold bolt unlockable
[2:14:06] <%GalacticaPhanto> @dova573 literally just now
[2:14:09] <%megadblitz> joining the stream what's with all the redbull cans? what are they and are they the currency?
[2:14:11] <+psychotripstreams> @dova573 A few minutes ago
[2:14:15] <Thepothero> They suck in the 1 st game too
[2:14:15] <Profmcstevie> The desert and the snow area in R&C 2 can die in a fire
[2:14:16] <Brothermanhyll> that one guy woulda been pissed about lady clank
[2:14:18] <%GalacticaPhanto> @knightasteran that's pretty cool
[2:14:23] <Dova573> lol i missed it
[2:14:23] <nesbitt22> OMG Pat is Rachet Shadow the Hedgehog now?
[2:14:31] <brachydios777> They remind me of those things from The Maxx
[2:14:33] <+tigerfang86> the snow area of Going Commando SUCKED ASS

[2:19:28] <+fugatlas> yup, in this universe they never got blood lust and instead beccame monks
[2:19:31] <brachydios777> That's funny

[2:21:05] <dashwallkick> ohhh, KT. Katie.
[2:21:05] <tengel66> hi, pat. The Sly Cooper reference was neat.
[2:21:12] <brachydios777> So Lombaxes are Chozo
[2:21:14] <%AzureGale> GET DRILL
[2:21:25] <%megadblitz> "yo there was this weird hairless mole with a silly costume on."
[2:21:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Knack had a deep voice
[2:21:27] <heart_ablaze> are they building their own universe or are these just references?
[2:21:34] <+Ghufufin> Compensating for nothing
[2:21:35] <%The_Protagonist> is that the Megaman Legends drill arm? :V
[2:21:37] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> now pierce the heavens
[2:21:38] <s1rcuit> reminds me of the shark gun from Armed and Dangerous
[2:21:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @patstaresat so someone at Insomniac liked you and Woolies gorb and porb bit much they put it in the game as a lorb?
[2:21:42] <%bevyrage> references to their other games @heart_ablaze
[2:21:47] <%Dakuu75> @brachydios777 yeah, pretty much
[2:21:48] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> tengen toppa gurren lombax
[2:21:52] <$KnightAsteran> @heart_ablaze just references
[2:21:55] <Brothermanhyll> "there was this screaming robot looking guy shooting at meat things with mining equipment"
[2:22:02] <%Zeikier> @s1rcuit hell yeah the Landshark gun
[2:22:22] <+TheCrispyBoi> this whole game is just "what if sonic but good"
[2:22:26] <s1rcuit> @s1rcuit that thing was so broken
[2:22:51] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:22:51] <+Kango234> "You're trapped in here with me"
[2:23:00] <+fugatlas> its a gun that shoots an explosive pupper, it is an actual Bark Buster
[2:23:14] <nomos42> she's not like other monks
[2:23:16] <Brothermanhyll> It has become increasingly obvious, I can deny it no longer
[2:23:17] <%bevyrage> @TheCrispyBoi the twist here is 3D sonic games were trying to ape rachet & clank, sly cooper, etc
[2:23:18] <%StaceMcGate> Pat relates
[2:23:19] <+tigerfang86> Bork Buster
[2:23:19] <%radregice> manlet
[2:23:29] <%The_Protagonist> why did he hesitate to say Clank?
[2:23:34] <%TheYellowcouch> it makes you not understand Lady D
[2:23:40] <s1rcuit> LUL
[2:23:40] <%Delenay> i stepped away and didnt think story would happen this fast. we got a alt clank now?
[2:23:41] <+TopTieramisu> if you're small enough, life is RE8
[2:23:42] <%HunguyTV> Does this also have the different dialogue for when in combat like spider man?
[2:23:43] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> why did he not say Clanks names?
[2:23:44] <%maenos2> Paige is on fire?
[2:23:45] <%Arancet> howd she set herself on fire this time?
[2:23:45] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> pat got himself some lombussy already
[2:23:46] <%megadblitz> is she asleep?
[2:23:46] <Animeshowfan> best part about being short is getting a tall wife
[2:23:47] <%AzureGale> Hey do you think they recorded two different versions of lines with Ratchet, one for when he's idle and one where he's doing stuff?
[2:23:53] <+KingKrampus> pat is like what, 4 feet?
[2:24:06] <%HunguyTV> I dont remember clank shouting this line for me, but it might be just me being wrong
[2:24:07] <raikagelord1> Currently on fire? Oof
[2:24:11] <Brothermanhyll> I hope we get Ratcher screaming like Deacon
[2:24:12] <SummonerMagno> is she reading, and by reading i mean watching tiktoks?
[2:24:13] <+tigerfang86> DOUBT
[2:24:14] <SilverFaustX> lol
[2:24:15] <%Ipsenscastle> I'd say 'tell us her most embarrassing secret' but I feel like that would be redundant at this stage
[2:24:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pat is short and that means he is closer in proximity to hot lady bussy
[2:24:16] <+JonathLP> 3ft?
[2:24:17] <%HunguyTV> ratchet* oof
[2:24:18] <%maenos2> @kingkrampus that one picture with the chocolate bunny calculated as 4 foot 3
[2:24:19] <%TheYellowcouch> You're 3 feet
[2:24:19] <%bevyrage> pat is 2 feet
[2:24:20] <+KingKrampus> lady d is one normal lady taller than Pat
[2:24:20] <s1rcuit> @KingKrampus 3 feet
[2:24:20] <%MelBrooksKA> 2 foot 5 inches @KingKrampus
[2:24:21] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:24:22] <tpindustriesV> thumbellina
[2:24:22] <+Catoclystic> 3 foot 112 inches
[2:24:22] <SilverFaustX> smal
[2:24:22] <%cvp5127> whats the difference
[2:24:24] <brachydios777> DOUBT
[2:24:28] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat is only 3 redbull cans tall
[2:24:28] <%AzureGale> Best part about being short is being able to cosplay small girl characters more easily
[2:24:30] <%TheMoenia> what is that like 150 cm?
[2:24:30] <romc215> Small but mighty
[2:24:32] <RinWR> 4 apples
[2:24:40] <%MrUnKnownAlien> is that with shoes on or off pat
[2:24:43] <mak0t0yukii> SHORT MAN
[2:24:43] <%megadblitz> pat is actually 8 ft everyone around him just grows like 10 feet taller when they're around him
[2:24:49] <+probably_facetious> Everything below 5'10" looks the same to me
[2:24:54] <+ThomasOfTroy> Pat's short enough that we don't need to say he's even shorter than he already is
[2:24:55] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat is short because he‚Äôs weighed down by his big‚Ä¶ ego
[2:24:57] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't believe Pat is only 1 foot tall
[2:25:01] <zanzibarian_hamster> Shortness seems easier to maintain, you eat less, put on muscle easier etc, I envy that
[2:25:01] <%cvp5127> yea violence
[2:25:02] <andrewofbob> That was the puzzle
[2:25:03] <%The_Protagonist> it was a ... "puzzle"
[2:25:05] <brachydios777> Pat is literaly the size of a child
[2:25:06] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Puzzle for babbiews
[2:25:07] <+MelodyMedley> It sure is!

[2:25:49] <+dramajoe> IQ
[2:25:49] <%SaiyanShoto> I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs intelligent cube
[2:25:51] <ThatGuyThere03> ohhhhhhh it's reference to Sony published stuff

[2:25:58] <auraofdawn> minecraft is the stupid cubes
[2:25:58] <+Ldubz88> played the hell out of the demo
[2:25:58] <%Vyskus> intelligent cube kicked my ass as a kid. I had a demo disk with it
[2:25:59] <%megadblitz> one of those 10 people is apparently this lombax
[2:25:59] <+dramajoe> should have been devil dice
[2:25:59] <raikagelord1> I feel like your right.

[2:26:06] <%AzureGale> Nah that's totally Mario Party
[2:26:07] <+MelodyMedley> Nice skip
[2:26:07] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:26:08] <Saltmeisterr> IT HAD SICK MUSIC
[2:26:09] <Frogwash> It was a ps1 game
[2:26:16] <%Maids4lyfe> the game is legitimately called Intelligent Cube
[2:26:18] <%Zeikier> it was ran at AGDQ and the people running it were basically aliens for how esoterically they explained it
[2:26:19] <romc215> Intelligent Qube was a ball buster, cool music though
[2:26:26] <%Zeikier> which made it harder to understand lol
[2:26:34] <%Ipsenscastle> All these dumb kids don't know about intelligent cube omg terrible
[2:26:36] <%AzureGale> FAILURE
[2:26:38] <s1rcuit> LUL
[2:26:40] <$SGrim> too slow
[2:26:43] <SilverFaustX> missed one
[2:26:49] <+JonathLP> pat doesn't understand portals

[2:27:05] <+MelodyMedley> They totally knew
[2:27:08] <%AzureGale> gj
[2:27:19] <scrumbotime> lorbussy
[2:27:24] <auraofdawn> LORB
[2:27:24] <morippenya> I only know about intelligent cube because of game center cx
[2:27:26] <+CookieCutter007> sasuga game design
[2:27:33] <%AzureGale> GOTTA GO FAST
[2:27:38] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:27:39] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:27:49] <%megadblitz> aha what a silly man
[2:27:50] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LUL
[2:27:52] <+tigerfang86> isnt kaden like, rachet's dad??? idk the later lore for ratchet
[2:27:53] <CappuccinoGuil> What an idiot, I wanna give him a kiss
[2:27:59] <+JonathLP> HOVERING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[2:28:03] <StarMechV> Silly Lombussy
[2:28:04] <JetpackMcQuack> More sonic than sonic
[2:28:04] <+BIumen> you are shadow the hedgehog
[2:28:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> @tigerfang86 yes
[2:28:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Intelligent Qube was a game where you stood on a platform about 8 cubes wide and an infinite amount of cubes long
[2:28:08] <%megadblitz> does this make rivet sonic?
[2:28:10] <+TopTieramisu> ratchet and clank, the true 3d sonic
[2:28:17] <AllenDeadman> weird dog
[2:28:18] <s1rcuit> it's that mechanical creature from the pub, you might be able to ride it
[2:28:26] <Cymen90> SONIC SHOULD FEEL LIKE THIS
[2:28:28] <%bmoral64> bmoral64 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[2:28:29] <ChaosedStar> its a zangief
[2:28:38] <JetpackMcQuack> What if sonic team just dialed back the 'faster than sound' thing
[2:28:40] <+tigerfang86> @legendfather_of_giants ah cool
[2:28:53] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And on top of this platform, cubes rolled at you, and you needed to make a path for yourself with grid bombs by blowing up the cubes
[2:29:01] <%KaiserMario> psaCrazyhand
[2:29:13] <+ImmaterialHero> its an egg dude from spyro pat
[2:29:13] <Cymen90> Raritanium is such a clear parody of Unobtanium
[2:29:13] <%maenos2> ah this
[2:29:15] <StarMechV> its a moving shrine
[2:29:22] <+tigerfang86> you FOOL
[2:29:25] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Failure to do this perfectly resulted in either you getting smashed, and/or falling screaming into blackness
[2:29:37] <+TopTieramisu> if they scaled back how fast sonic was going, maybe they wouldn't have to resort to linear segments so often
[2:29:40] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> @cymen90 nah it's always been a thing since R&C 2
[2:29:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Then, your "IQ" would be somehow calculated by this
[2:29:46] <%Delenay> ... what if sonic was good
[2:29:49] <%HunguyTV> Dont jump at the edges
[2:30:04] <+TheCrispyBoi> sega hire this man
[2:30:09] <+MelodyMedley> So much energy
[2:30:27] <%maenos2> LORB
[2:30:40] <%cvp5127> jak and daxter
[2:30:42] <Cymen90> @abelincoln_catpuncher I think you took what I said the opposite way it was intended? I was not saying this should not be like this because it is like Sonic. I am saying I WISH Sonic was more like this!
[2:30:47] <%Ipsenscastle> JAK AND DAXTERRRR
[2:30:48] <StarMechV> Jak & Daxter!!!

[2:31:07] <emMmDeeKay> I MUST KILL GENERAL PRAXIS
[2:31:09] <romc215> With all of those energy drinks, Ratchet shouldn't need any devices to jump between dimensions lol
[2:31:11] <s1rcuit> still plenty of love for their Naughty Dog friends
[2:31:11] <+Kango234> The last time Sony will acknowledge them
[2:31:12] <Sol_Install> Making me sad
[2:31:15] <brachydios777> Definitly J and D
[2:31:22] <+FoolsArcade> Insomniac should buy the rights to Jak and Daxter
[2:31:25] <+tigerfang86> Dog gun dog gun dog gun
[2:31:26] <%cvp5127> too bad naughty dog hates fun now
[2:31:32] <%megadblitz> gief gun

[2:31:40] <+MelodyMedley> Big damage
[2:31:45] <+Exicuren> Oh look, Insomniac has so much more love towards Sony's IPs than Sony themselves
[2:31:52] <emMmDeeKay> Gief does slime damage
[2:31:52] <+tigerfang86> wet boy
[2:31:53] <%TheMoenia> has gief had anymore cummie accidents?

[2:32:28] <ScreamLord> That's a lot a Redbull
[2:32:33] <s1rcuit> Gief does crush/gravity damage
[2:32:34] <$Futurecity10> isnt jak and dexter actually physically in this game?
[2:32:35] <romc215> I mean, a dog's mouth is cleaner than a human's so... it's all good, right?
[2:32:35] <+Ghufufin> so very MOIST
[2:32:36] <%TheYellowcouch> As long as it's not Butt liquids
[2:32:39] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you're getting a lot of money on this planet
[2:32:41] <%Ranryu692> How goes the quest for lombussy? Have you determined what the B stands for yet?
[2:32:42] <%MidnightBurst12> mucus mutt
[2:32:50] <%Bane_Kaikyo> L O V E
[2:32:52] <Cymen90> How do you describe Paige?
[2:32:58] <+probably_facetious> @themoenia Gief no longer produces cummies
[2:33:00] <Animeshowfan> hes just so smart his brain juices are leaking out cause there isnt enough room in that big brain
[2:33:02] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I knew a fucking giant bulldog that would go crazy at cigarette butts for some reason
[2:33:07] <brachydios777> Pig Dog, Pog
[2:33:14] <+tigerfang86> MAD MAX SHIT
[2:33:20] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> truly now an x man
[2:33:21] <+MelodyMedley> Niiice
[2:33:28] <+TopTieramisu> an arc reactor
[2:33:29] <+TheCrispyBoi> do you have to cover your drinks
[2:33:30] <%Ranryu692> a red visor and an X on the chest? You're just cosplaying as Cyclops
[2:33:33] <Cymen90> ROITUOUS
[2:33:37] <+MelodyMedley> Time to get more LORBS
[2:33:48] <%Ipsenscastle> omg he is in Cyclops cosplay
[2:33:49] <%LeiaSkynoober> Who is this guy, why aren't we playing as Riviet anymore
[2:33:51] <%maenos2> righteous is such a cromulent term
[2:33:58] <raikagelord1> Righteous Dude
[2:34:01] <%TheMoenia> @probably_facetious oh no, not his cummies
[2:34:05] <%radregice> when the game makes you actually want to run around and collect shit that's real good
[2:34:15] <s1rcuit> I love that even after all these years they still got love for their friends at ND
[2:34:17] <%maenos2> amwn
[2:34:19] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt This is probably the biggest map in the game
[2:34:21] <%maenos2> amen rather
[2:34:24] <JetpackMcQuack> neffWicked rightous
[2:34:33] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like trying to propel yourself in that manner would cause you to eat shit
[2:34:34] <$Ziegsy> its better when you tap l2
[2:34:36] <+alphonseisbest> Da FUC is a cromulen?
[2:34:39] <%HunguyTV> The way the haptics shift when you turn at high speed feels great
[2:34:53] <%Broand> Be careful not to act on Righteous Abandon
[2:35:09] <%bevyrage> acceptable or adequate
[2:35:09] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> is this just skubb
[2:35:15] <+BIumen> god damnit dude
[2:35:16] <StarMechV> This is a reference to a previous Ratchet game
[2:35:17] <%heartlesshealer> =)
[2:35:20] <%xmetalicdemonx> yeah everybody knows that word and are not totally looking it up now
[2:35:20] <+BIumen> it really was
[2:35:24] <%bmoral64> skubb is so not cromulent
[2:35:24] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Use google.... type in "Cromulent definition"
[2:35:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt THAT CAUSED THE PS3 GAMES TO HAPPEN
[2:35:27] <$realm_forge> It‚Äôs an evil space empire from Star Trek
[2:35:28] <AllenDeadman> sure does
[2:35:28] <Brothermanhyll> if you get shot in the head it'll create rift storms you jackass
[2:35:29] <+MelodyMedley> That's a terrible terrible idea
[2:35:29] <%Ipsenscastle> I'd never heard the word 'embiggens' before I came to Springfield
[2:35:30] <Animeshowfan> he just invinted vr
[2:35:35] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt In the PS3 games the Dimensionator was a dumb looking hat
[2:35:42] <+BIumen> it also looks very silly
[2:35:42] <StarMechV> this explains it
[2:35:46] <s1rcuit> @StarMechV which tells me that they didn't stay with the retcon
[2:35:47] <auraofdawn> it was a terrible idea and thats why all the other ones went boom
[2:36:07] <emMmDeeKay> Cromulent: Acceptable, adequate. Useful to identify douches when they use it in regular conversation.
[2:36:12] <%maenos2> so much energy drank
[2:36:16] <StarMechV> @StarMechV You eman the PS4 game?That wa salways planned to just be a one time thing
[2:36:21] <ScreamLord> Ratchet's gonna get a heartattack from all these Redbulls
[2:36:27] <+fugatlas> Ratchet and clank: throw away lorb explaining why the dimmensonator isn't a hat. Kingdom hearts: make an entire game explaining why mickey isn't wearing a shirt that one time
[2:36:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Stole this from Warframe
[2:36:44] <ketchuo13> I really should replay Sunset Overdrive
[2:36:55] <%maenos2> Jesus so many cans
[2:36:55] <%valriot> Man Crash 4 was really good, but hard as FUCK to complete
[2:36:57] <wasteless40800> Pat I wanna play this so bad
[2:37:00] <+probably_facetious> First try
[2:37:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> DEADLOCKED
[2:37:04] <mattdaddyd101> Cans!!!!
[2:37:07] <%Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:37:15] <%AzureGale> YEYEYE
[2:37:16] <raikagelord1> Deadlock
[2:37:18] <AllenDeadman> CAPTAIN DICKHEAD
[2:37:24] <ScreamLord> Space Luchador
[2:37:28] <brachydios777> That's a Captain Marvel
[2:37:32] <$SGrim> Deadlock? More like dead game LUL
[2:37:34] <Thepothero> Oh from deadlocked
[2:37:37] <raikagelord1> LOVED Ratchet: Deadlock
[2:37:43] <s1rcuit> @AllenDeadman if you mean the villain I think that was Hardlight
[2:37:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt its a reference to a minor character from R&C 4
[2:37:56] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> ratchet deadlocked was legit fantastic
[2:38:01] <+MelodyMedley> I'm actually real jealous that this is only on ps5
[2:38:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Deadlocked felt like a reasonably good mod
[2:38:12] <tpindustriesV> deadlocked was fun as a couch coop, but solo not so much
[2:38:25] <raikagelord1> Also liked Captain Starsheild even though he died in the opening cutscene. LUL I just like Captain Space Hero‚Äôs
[2:38:27] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Image if Insomniac made Jak and Daxter game.
[2:38:32] <s1rcuit> @MelodyMedley same, there's actually a bunch of good games on it and I can't play them
[2:38:39] <Animeshowfan> did you actually use voice commands in dreadlock?
[2:38:48] <ScreamLord> Same can be said about Oddworld Soul Storm
[2:38:56] <%Ascethetic> yo pat, what was your favorite of the original 3?
[2:39:06] <%maenos2> BEEEEEES
[2:39:10] <Brothermanhyll> The hostels
[2:39:21] <StarMechV> tTime to shoot some mroe Giefs
[2:39:23] <+MightyDuckShoes> so we can expect ps5s  to be reasonably stocked in stores by 2023, right?
[2:39:29] <%The_Protagonist> does the drill shoot exploding dogs?
[2:39:32] <chimeraxmachina> This planets design is legit awesome...
[2:39:35] <raikagelord1> Ratchet Deadlock was my favorite ratchet and clank game because how a little bit edgeir it was
[2:39:39] <%cvp5127> little big planet

[2:40:52] <%sjay662> other way @PatStaresAt
[2:40:53] <+BIumen> i think you went backwards
[2:40:53] <%cvp5127> went backward
[2:40:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> you're probably doing this backwards
[2:40:58] <%bevyrage> you were going the wrong way to it
[2:41:02] <Frogwash> Wrong side
[2:41:02] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> neat how speed pads turn and reorient for you
[2:41:05] <%Ranryu692> that's pretty cool
[2:41:12] <chimeraxmachina> Merch idea: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just pat‚Äù hoodies

[2:41:27] <+FoolsArcade> why go back
[2:41:30] <@commanderclaw> You passed it
[2:41:34] <Cymen90> Ratchet and Clank is the BEST Sonic game
[2:41:46] <+FoolsArcade> but you were next to the lorb
[2:41:47] <+MelodyMedley> There's the gold!
[2:42:00] <%HunguyTV> All i remember about Littlebigplanet 1 is listening to "My Patch" for hours while making bad levels
[2:42:03] <%Ranryu692> LUL did you change off of the visor because you looked like Cyclops? @PatStaresAt
[2:42:03] <+FoolsArcade> owned
[2:42:05] <%HunguyTV> and the skateboard
[2:42:05] <s1rcuit> @Cymen90 kinda like how Okami is the best Legend of Zelda game
[2:42:06] <+MelodyMedley> Jukebox music!
[2:42:14] <Cymen90> O W N E D
[2:42:19] <+featherlan> LittleBigPlanet 2 was the best one, I swear
[2:42:23] <%Puhff> git pwnt nerd
[2:42:29] <Brothermanhyll> All I remember about LBP is that it got me into Passion Pit before they started making crappy pop anthems

[2:43:07] <SkinnyRite> lol earlier than usual gotta play happy games like this during the day lol
[2:43:15] <+tigerfang86> the beauty of Ratchet games is that you can just main whatever you want basically
[2:43:16] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> thus pat commited genocide
[2:43:37] <tpindustriesV> what happened to mr fungi?
[2:43:43] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt the raritanoum upgrade system was nly implemented in the PS3 games, but the level-ups have eben around since at least 2
[2:43:51] <Brothermanhyll> fungi retired

[2:44:19] <%AzureGale> Or the Parappa dimension
[2:44:20] <iosephe> Yeah
[2:44:23] <+ScrapKingKeita> He needed a few years to do it
[2:44:25] <%Zeikier> time to fight that guy as the final boss
[2:44:28] <%AzureGale> Or the Ape Escape dimension
[2:44:29] <+Ghufufin> mapped infinity ok
[2:44:30] <bigshedman> Mapped out all five dimensions in existence Kappa
[2:44:36] <AllenDeadman> it was during a few years
[2:44:38] <+KingKrampus> @azuregale buzz lightyear?
[2:44:38] <%AzureGale> Or the Metal Gear Solid dimension
[2:44:40] <Brothermanhyll> what about the metal gear solid dimension
[2:44:43] <Cymen90> D:
[2:44:45] <%SolidusRex> Do you think he went to the Bible Black dimension?
[2:44:46] <nyacoo> pew pew pew
[2:44:48] <%valriot> Go to the Bloodborne dimension and gimme a fucking PC port
[2:44:51] <TurtlesAndTentacles> I was here for Lorb 4 I missed 5 lorbs i that short about of time? Any other Sony Games references chat?
[2:44:57] <%Puhff> or the dogwelder dimension
[2:45:00] <%AzureGale> @KingKrampus No the quiz game series
[2:45:02] <Brothermanhyll> Dead Space dimension
[2:45:05] <+featherlan> Like, does Ratchet & Clank follow the rules of the New 52, or what?
[2:45:10] <%Ipsenscastle> Leisure Suit Larry dimension
[2:45:10] <tomikaze_> I 99% completed the game but theres a gold nug on this world I cant access due to a bug.
[2:45:23] <%AzureGale> Siren dimension
[2:45:36] <%cvp5127> @tomikaze_ for real
[2:45:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> @TurtlesAndTentacles Jak, LittleBigPlanet, Knack, I dont remember Intelligent Qube
[2:45:48] <$Ziegsy> you can catch it
[2:45:58] <notsoy> BOOST
[2:46:03] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> whos KT's VA
[2:46:12] <tomikaze_> @cvp5127 you can't get the gold bolt behind the Glitch door either?
[2:46:33] <%AzureGale> @Top_Lane_Duelist Debra Wilson apparently
[2:46:33] <%SolidusRex> Don't forget Sly Cooper
[2:46:33] <+featherlan> @Top_Lane_Duelist I JUST looked her up, shit....
[2:46:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Intelligent Qube was like 1996 I think
[2:46:34] <+MelodyMedley> Lorb complete
[2:46:37] <Animeshowfan> master of unlorbing
[2:46:39] <Laseki> @Top_Lane_Duelist Debra Wilson
[2:46:46] <Sol_Install> OH
[2:46:57] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> humu humu
[2:46:59] <SomeAsianDood> wait isn't this just the plot of GOW reboot?
[2:47:02] <AllenDeadman> huh
[2:47:07] <Sol_Install> that makes a lot of sense
[2:47:08] <Yakobro> hide all the lombussy
[2:47:09] <Animeshowfan> so the lombax race was inside little big planet all along
[2:47:17] <Brothermanhyll> I thoguht for a second you meant Gears of War
[2:47:19] <%Ipsenscastle> Good thing I left all these audiologs around the landscape for people to collect
[2:47:20] <avidneptune> Well it was the plot of Tools of Destruction first
[2:47:28] <%SolidusRex> Actually it's the plot of Tools of Destruction bAck in 2007
[2:47:29] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Not a reboot but yes
[2:47:29] <+BIumen> This means all Ratchet and Clank cameos are canon
[2:47:31] <%hat_under_bread> Can't let the baddies get the lombussy.
[2:47:31] <%valriot> The Lombussy Dimension
[2:47:34] <+Ghufufin> so what makes Lombax so special?
[2:47:37] <%MajorCrasher> how is this the gow plot?
[2:47:52] <Brothermanhyll> we have a son to abuse
[2:47:53] <%valriot> @Ghufufin Big science
[2:47:53] <+BIumen> @Ghufufin they are very smart at dimensional stuff and it made them targets
[2:47:53] <bigshedman> The Playstation Allstars Battle Royal dimension LUL
[2:48:02] <SaltyAzteca> oh wow early stream, missed a bit
[2:48:08] <%sjay662> is it Atreus being a shit?
[2:48:09] <%MajorCrasher> you read that wrong
[2:48:10] <%maenos2> what's th3 one thing
[2:48:14] <professorbadvibes> pat what did you think of god of war pre-reboot
[2:48:22] <+Pilau32> its a 3 year old game, you can say it
[2:48:23] <+BIumen> R&C's dumb thing is how they had to retcon out the lady lombax in 2
[2:48:24] <+fugatlas> @Ghufufin big science, they can build literally anything, and canonically they're like the only race with 5 fingers, so they're better with mahcinery
[2:48:24] <Saltmeisterr> What thing?
[2:48:26] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @legendfather_of_giants Thank you! I miss Jak which sucks
[2:48:27] <brachydios777> Black Rune
[2:48:29] <professorbadvibes> compared to like, dmc
[2:48:30] <%thedankestmeeme> bro i'm  climbing the strive tower kinda easily
[2:48:31] <%Arancet> wait, what one thing? i dont recall
[2:48:32] <$Ziegsy> Im playing this and I may possibly have gotten myself permanently stcuk
[2:48:35] <%Zeikier> Path of DEATH!
[2:48:40] <scrumbotime> oh that was such a good line
[2:48:41] <+Ghufufin> ty helpful chat ppl
[2:48:43] <+featherlan> Look, I'm all for a proper Playstation All-Stars sequel, as long as they fix the kill system and unify the artstyle
[2:48:44] <Profmcstevie> I love r/Doom
[2:48:45] <%AzureGale> Trial/Doom is my new crack paring
[2:48:55] <BreakersAweigh> what's the one thing i'll be on edge about this for forever, pat
[2:49:02] <%valriot> Lombax got wiped tf out cos they basically had super science like time travel and shit
[2:49:03] <SkinnyRite> what's the God of war issue? I've beaten that game a ton
[2:49:04] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> @thedankestmeeme I've been stuck on floor 4 since launch I feel like the biggest smoothbrain
[2:49:16] <%heartlesshealer> lorb 12/12
[2:49:22] <%AzureGale> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[2:49:26] <+MelodyMedley> :(
[2:49:33] <$realm_forge> This is better than any 3D sonic ive ever seen
[2:49:34] <%Zeikier> This Is Football in 2055
[2:49:38] <CappuccinoGuil> THAT SOUNDS STUPID
[2:49:40] <+brightman42> is it if you know Norse mythology it ruins the twists?
[2:49:44] <andrewofbob> R&C backstory is a race war
[2:49:50] <bigshedman> Pat please, what was the one thing about the GoW plot. This will keep me up all night.
[2:49:56] <%Zeikier> Mags Mikkelson
[2:50:02] <+MisdirectionErection> Lorebax
[2:50:03] <$realm_forge> Like it does what sonic tries to do but waaay better
[2:50:05] <auraofdawn> the lombaxes were gonna be genocide-d if they didtn leave so i'd say it was a smart move
[2:50:09] <CappuccinoGuil> "We gotta get away to another dimension to run from our enermies" "Okay, let me just write down where we're going,"
[2:50:20] <wolfen091> gtg fast pat
[2:50:22] <chimeraxmachina> Cry
[2:50:24] <+JonathLP> So, does that mean with a rebuilt dimensionator and the map that Ratchet and Rivet can find the other Lombaxes?
[2:50:33] <%Xevtes> @CappuccinoGuil lombax only info
[2:50:33] <%Zeikier> Race. TO tha finish!
[2:50:34] <brisk_dacat> Mags‚Ä¶ Nikolson
[2:50:39] <Brothermanhyll> man those boots look like they feel good
[2:50:47] <+katarjin> @CappuccinoGuil in a log taht only lombax can get in to
[2:50:53] <%maenos2> wet lombussy
[2:50:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> @CappuccinoGuil it's probably locked behind a Lombax-only code or something
[2:50:54] <+featherlan> @CappuccinoGuil To be fair, not many races can reach them since they aren't as smart as the Lombaxes
[2:51:14] <JetpackMcQuack> What a creature
[2:51:17] <Brothermanhyll> Lombaxes seem to have a tendency to be action heroes
[2:51:21] <TurtlesAndTentacles> @cappuccinoguil only Lombax can access them so no one else would have known
[2:51:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> his skin texture is so detailed what the hell
[2:51:27] <%legendfather_of_giants> I just want the Deadlocked armor
[2:51:28] <%bevyrage> YEAAAAAAAAH
[2:51:29] <+TopTieramisu> smoke
[2:51:33] <%Ipsenscastle> KILLZONE
[2:51:34] <+featherlan> Yo, that's SICK
[2:51:36] <+MelodyMedley> Nice
[2:51:38] <CappuccinoGuil> @featherlan the fact Nefarious made the dimensionator work trumps everyone's arguments.
[2:51:39] <+fugatlas> you either need a dimmensionator or the abillity to make dimmensional rifts to get to the map, so it's not like they left a post it note on their workstation
[2:51:40] <Brothermanhyll> I am ENENRA
[2:51:41] <ScreamLord> Mad Bax
[2:51:42] <+Ghufufin> darth lombussy
[2:51:42] <%TheYellowcouch> owww the edge
[2:51:43] <%Zeikier> is that a killzone helmet
[2:51:43] <Justaguy3> you look like a space marine
[2:51:43] <Thepothero> Yooo
[2:51:43] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> ok thats alright
[2:51:44] <romc215> Sweet
[2:51:45] <%The_Protagonist> it fits the color palette because you're wearing the full armor lol
[2:51:46] <scrumbotime> 20% defense buff vs animals
[2:51:46] <%Zeikier> or Resistance?
[2:51:47] <JetpackMcQuack> Armor as black as my soul
[2:51:48] <brachydios777> Awesome
[2:51:55] <%LeiaSkynoober> This game looks so good, I want a PS5 to play this game
[2:51:57] <mattdaddyd101> Killzone
[2:52:01] <+KingKrampus> okay Shadow Pat the EdgeHog
[2:52:02] <$realm_forge> MADD LOMBAXX
[2:52:05] <SomeAsianDood> But is he edgy enough to kill CHAOS?
[2:52:07] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's kinda what I wish the armor in biomutant looked like
[2:52:13] <+featherlan> @CappuccinoGuil I said "NOT MANY" so there is leeway, like Nefarious
[2:52:26] <Profmcstevie> Hm....this really is just cool Biomutant
[2:52:27] <Brothermanhyll> you are right it does look like a helghast armor
[2:52:46] <DontChuckle98> Pat‚Äôs gonna turn this good Lombax boy edgy wether ya like it or not. lol

[2:53:30] <+KingKrampus> CRAZY TALK CRAZY TALK
[2:53:47] <CappuccinoGuil> @featherlan sounds stupidly dangerous and awkwardly convenient for the plot, but I'll see how it goes, I'm following the story along with you all here.
[2:53:53] <%HunguyTV> @thedankestmeeme But man, ye ps5 dpad is some rough shit for fighting games
[2:53:56] <+black_pariah> Ah, man, I just watched Geoff Keighley demonstrate that he doesn't know how to use a mini-map LUL
[2:54:03] <tpindustriesV> i wish the golden bolts were also golden cans
[2:54:03] <+MelodyMedley> Oh his voice is even muffled with the armour
[2:54:16] <avidneptune> RWBY moments
[2:54:40] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Ratchet and Rivet should mate to make Wrench
[2:54:41] <+featherlan> @CappuccinoGuil I mean, historically, the only race that has ever caused the Lombaxes legitimate problems were the Cragmites
[2:54:46] <iosephe> Praetorium.....
[2:54:46] <%TheYellowcouch> SUCH DEVASTATION
[2:54:47] <SaltyAzteca> Praetorian is always cool
[2:54:48] <%Dakuu75> DOOM
[2:54:49] <%AzureGale> WE DOOM NOW
[2:54:53] <+MelodyMedley> ooo
[2:54:53] <+JonathLP> Iron Ratchet?
[2:54:54] <bigshedman> That's just fucking Doomguy armour
[2:54:54] <+floweri> i need another blinx the time cat
[2:54:55] <BreakersAweigh> man this game looks fun
[2:54:57] <%sjay662> thats just Doom armor
[2:54:58] <SomeAsianDood> DOOM
[2:55:01] <%TheYellowcouch> THIS WAS NOT THE ARMOUR NOT MY INTETNION
[2:55:01] <%AzureGale> RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE
[2:55:04] <romc215> Pretorian, like Doom guy?
[2:55:05] <+fugatlas> you now permenantly recieve more raritanium, so nice
[2:55:09] <tpindustriesV> this kind of reminds me of DMC donte sequences
[2:55:24] <%valriot> I love Gaius
[2:55:25] <TysonSirius> Just tuned in, how is new Ratchet?
[2:55:29] <%sjay662> I started playing FF14, I understand what Such Devestation means now
[2:55:32] <$BlackMage66652> That is unironically Doom Slayer armor. The full set is straight up his armor.
[2:55:34] <$realm_forge> May the blood on your lombax never dry
[2:55:35] <Thepothero> WE WILL SPEAK LATER ASCIAN
[2:55:39] <+MelodyMedley> New Ratchet is very good
[2:56:01] <+katarjin> lol
[2:56:03] <avidneptune> It‚Äôs the final Armor from Tools of Destruction I‚Äôm pretty sure
[2:56:04] <+MelodyMedley> There it is
[2:56:06] <%Dfreddy8> THERE
[2:56:06] <iosephe> DAMN YOU ASCIAN
[2:56:07] <scrumbotime> Literally Right There
[2:56:08] <romc215> Doombax
[2:56:14] <%Dakuu75> wut
[2:56:14] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> what
[2:56:16] <+KingKrampus> HAHA
[2:56:16] <%Ipsenscastle> ????
[2:56:16] <raikagelord1> Wowwww
[2:56:17] <+TopTieramisu> killbox?
[2:56:18] <+tigerfang86> nice job NERD
[2:56:19] <Brothermanhyll> d i e
[2:56:20] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt There's a theory that the reason Lombaxes were so advanced compared to other species is because they have five fingers. More dexterous hands that can do stuff faster compared to the clumsy 3-fingered folk
[2:56:25] <+MelodyMedley> Huh
[2:56:26] <Laseki> that happens, its a bug
[2:56:27] <+probably_facetious> ?????
[2:56:34] <%maenos2> cute
[2:56:35] <+MelodyMedley> Cute
[2:56:35] <+Shillk> if you approach those platforms from the wrong side, you just die
[2:56:38] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I LIKE KT
[2:56:40] <Animeshowfan> god shes so cute
[2:56:43] <amonimis> so how important is being familiar with the other ratchet games for this one?
[2:56:43] <+fugatlas> probably the dumbest issue with the game, there seems to be some sort of sensor for if you are in free fall for to long. The gaem assumes you're stuck or dying and just resets you, even if you're jumping from on platform to another
[2:56:53] <+MelodyMedley> KT more like QT
[2:57:00] <+featherlan> @ScreamLord Yo, I've never heard about that; that actually makes so much sense
[2:57:03] <+brightman42> the third gold bolt can't be reached until later in the game fyi
[2:57:18] <%Dakuu75> scarf
[2:57:18] <+KingKrampus> I want a KT doll
[2:57:19] <+tigerfang86> yo that one OWNS
[2:57:22] <TysonSirius> MegaMan X Upgrade pod like :
[2:57:22] <chimeraxmachina> Kt is warming up to ratchet awwwww
[2:57:24] <scrumbotime> skullomania running wild
[2:57:24] <brachydios777> Yoooo!
[2:57:26] <%Mrbaconator> dripbax
[2:57:30] <+MelodyMedley> Nice scarf
[2:57:34] <%xmetalicdemonx> Scarf makes everything better
[2:57:43] <$realm_forge> Cerberus armor
[2:57:46] <%maenos2> lombussy drips
[2:57:52] <scrumbotime> Go Lombussy
[2:57:56] <%sjay662> Rachet is a disparaging term?
[2:58:02] <%maenos2> LUL
[2:58:05] <zanzibarian_hamster> ?
[2:58:05] <+ScrapKingKeita> Lombanus
[2:58:05] <+MelodyMedley> Insomniac should just make a sonic game at this point
[2:58:07] <$BlackMage66652> L o m b u s s y
[2:58:08] <+KingKrampus> stop being anti furry pat
[2:58:09] <%Mrbaconator> i think it means scummy
[2:58:11] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyNana Cursed
[2:58:12] <+fugatlas> i made the mistake of watching the RLM video on BS Dracula before playing this game, and now when i see KT all I see is dumb butt head dracula
[2:58:12] <Saltmeisterr> lombussy man
[2:58:14] <avidneptune> Rat Shit
[2:58:14] <%THATGUY_789> rat shit?
[2:58:15] <%valriot> Nurse Ratchet and her Lombussy
[2:58:16] <Profmcstevie> why don't you calm down YOUR lombussy
[2:58:16] <%maenos2> it is?
[2:58:18] <SaltyAzteca> Why have we created a monster in this chat BibleThump
[2:58:21] <romc215> LIke, Nurse Ratchet
[2:58:22] <bigshedman> Oh right, like ratchety old man
[2:58:23] <+samuraiknack> WAL
[2:58:24] <%TheYellowcouch> Someone has not been listening to rap
[2:58:24] <Brothermanhyll> Can you call someone clank
[2:58:26] <+floweri> it means ghetto
[2:58:29] <%BarujaraciGaming> no ratchet means like "slutty"
[2:58:32] <ScreamLord> @featherlan It also explains why Lombaxes are so technically adept because a majority of tech is build for large 3-fingered hands so they have to modify it for smaller 5-fingered hands
[2:58:33] <+JonathLP> Calling Rivet ratchet is like 3 insults in one
[2:58:38] <%Ynkubus_> @valriot gross
[2:58:39] <BreakersAweigh> yeah its like modern age ghetto
[2:58:40] <+Ghufufin> depends on your region
[2:58:41] <%maenos2> I'm not hip to the longo
[2:58:43] <%Dakuu75> Question: Did the PS3 games get remakes too?
[2:58:45] <+KingKrampus> oh I knew
[2:58:46] <%MidnightBurst12> similar to trashy
[2:58:47] <brachydios777> its a thing chat
[2:58:48] <%Extrallent> Sounds like an old person insult
[2:58:49] <%megadblitz> I know it's like an adjective, but is it also a noun?
[2:58:50] <SaltyAzteca> You know why Pat.
[2:58:51] <zanzibarian_hamster> Is it an america-y thing?
[2:58:53] <%SolidusRex> Must be a Canadian thing
[2:58:56] <scrumbotime> That's actually the better question
[2:58:57] <%MelBrooksKA> I knew it in like 2012, I was hoping it was dead
[2:58:57] <%moink1234> It's like the third or 4th definition on urban dictionary
[2:58:58] <Profmcstevie> Cos you're old
[2:58:58] <%AzureGale> @Dakuu75 No
[2:58:58] <+KingKrampus> I've been on Twitter enough
[2:58:59] <+gitgouda> never heard ratchet ass [blank]
[2:58:59] <avidneptune> Is that a Canada thing?
[2:58:59] <amonimis> I knew that pat
[2:58:59] <%THATGUY_789> colloquium
[2:58:59] <TysonSirius> Pat "HELLO FELLO CHILDREN"
[2:59:00] <+Glass_Muffin> Ratchet means like ghetto or like trashy
[2:59:01] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt I've heard of Wretched but not Ratchet as an insult

[2:59:28] <%Fooguwu> SET ME FREE
[2:59:31] <BreakersAweigh> you were correct it was cool
[2:59:34] <chimeraxmachina> I‚Äôve only learned about ‚Äúratchet‚Äù being a bad word via drag race ngl. Never heard it before that
[2:59:36] <raikagelord1> Ratchet is the slang word for trash/Slutty and an African American thing to be specific
[2:59:36] <+mangodroid> Ratchet is AAVE
[2:59:41] <Brothermanhyll> nah just speedrun it
[2:59:45] <+RowenCleric> chat is whiter than pat confirmed
[3:00:04] <Brothermanhyll> oh kicks mean shoes

[3:00:29] <%megadblitz> @chimeraxmachina it essentially means like ghetto, shitty, "you poor bitch your look is goddamn atrocious" but in a sassy guuurrrlll way
[3:00:29] <$Ziegsy> how many bolts does pat have?
[3:00:30] <%SolidusRex> The sprinklers are OP
[3:00:32] <+fugatlas> @xmetalicdemonx It gets a DOT eventually instead of just being a stun
[3:00:39] <+ScrapKingKeita> yeah, turrets in R&C have traditionally felt kind of boring, but like, the Additions like Fungi and Zurkon are fun
[3:00:49] <%xmetalicdemonx> oh cool
[3:00:54] <+fugatlas> you can stun lock the final boss with the sprinkler, it's the best
[3:00:57] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Urban dictionary defines "Ratchet" as "another name for a socket wrench"
[3:01:13] <+featherlan> I'm glad the music has started going back to the sci-fi feeling electronic-y vibes that the original series had
[3:01:24] <SuperChumps> @PatStaresAt Could you help me decide between buying a pair of shorts with tiny lobsters on them or shorts with tiny crabs on them? Thanks.
[3:01:25] <$realm_forge> Wow sonic can suck it

[3:01:55] <%TheYellowcouch> Suck a clank
[3:01:56] <Kain5707> ü¶Ä
[3:01:57] <+MelodyMedley> Crabs sound better

[3:01:57] <+TopTieramisu> crabs also has the association with the crotch
[3:01:58] <%AzureGale> Yes get crabs for your crotch

[3:02:00] <%AzureGale> wait
[3:02:00] <scrumbotime> Go lobsters so you don't have the Crabs and Crotch associations
[3:02:01] <Brothermanhyll> isn't lobster A crab
[3:02:02] <+Zeromaru2> Al must return to crab

[3:02:10] <brachydios777> Crab is good
[3:02:10] <+Zeromaru2> But I like eating lobster more
[3:02:11] <%monsieurfantastic> but then everyone will think you have crabs
[3:02:11] <Profmcstevie> Also plenty of "I got crabs" jokes
[3:02:14] <zanzibarian_hamster> Carcinisation is a thing, everything will return to crab, embrace it
[3:02:17] <+tweedler92> Crab good
[3:02:18] <%BarujaraciGaming> CRAB........BATTLE
[3:02:19] <+Pilau32> why would u want crabs around the crotch area?
[3:02:19] <%THATGUY_789> do the crabs have a small top hat
[3:02:20] <+fugatlas> It is illegal in Maine to give a prisoner lobster more then twice a week
[3:02:22] <+MelodyMedley> So many energy drinks
[3:02:34] <+mangodroid> Crabs that close to you junk?

[3:13:39] <+ScrapKingKeita> If they're the same type of robot as Clank, KT is probably worried about being a war machine
[3:13:39] <+psychotripstreams> KT is a war criminal confirmed.
[3:13:41] <Brothermanhyll> "Katie i'm used to being friends with war criminals, clank caused this whole thing"
[3:13:42] <GarbageQueenEllie> KT's war crime was beeing too cute
[3:13:42] <+KingKrampus> @cappuccinoguil why 4825 specifically

[3:31:43] <+FoolsArcade> @razieltano123 they showed it in the cutscene
[3:31:46] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> the latter seems very feasible

[3:33:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Hey chat. Kill All Humans could have been an Invader Zim game....but it wasn't
[3:33:12] <professorbadvibes> does anyone remember how ape escape had a remake on the PSP and the english dub cast richard horvitz as spike

[3:33:34] <%THATGUY_789> drill hound is a portable e
[3:33:37] <%sjay662> it costs when it gets shot at
[3:33:38] <+BIumen> shotgun 3 time

[3:33:40] <Pookiedaexzile> @sjay662 DESTROY US ALL
[3:33:42] <$BlackMage66652> It does when it absorbs things and fires
[3:33:44] <razieltano123> %%%%

[3:43:54] <JetpackMcQuack> GivePLZ GivePLZ GivePLZ
[3:43:55] <brachydios777> Master Miller!?
[3:43:57] <psimon_> @MugenSandan anyt vegetables or?
[3:43:59] <%crimsonharvest> if i have to eat it with my parents the earlier the better so i can recover
[3:44:02] <Hellarussian> this level is all sorts of dank
[3:44:03] <BurningAc3s> put stuff in the tum tums
[3:44:03] <%DeaconBluesClues> I try to do stuff before I'm too tired to do it so as noted id do prep now at a minimum. same with ordering food since places around me close eadly
[3:44:10] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> stick a prokchop in a blender and just drip feed it to him
[3:44:11] <%Dfreddy8> YES
[3:44:14] <$realm_forge> I already had my sad solitary bachelor dinner thanks
[3:44:20] <BreakersAweigh> @PeachSaliva sounds delicious actually
[3:44:21] <bigshedman> @brachydios777 Yep! And he does a slight british accent. It's great!
[3:44:25] <@PeachSaliva> @realm_forge aw, I would cook you dinner hon
[3:44:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Paige in the kitchen cooking chicken Candy
[3:44:31] <%DeaconBluesClues> @peachsaliva sounds good but bacon wrapping is always a lot of work in my experience
[3:44:32] <romc215> This section reminds me of that part in Titanfall 2 where you had to jump back and forth through time to get around obstacles and such
[3:44:36] <+tigerfang86> the BLEEP BLOOPS
[3:44:42] <%Ipsenscastle> Bachelor Chow: now with flavour!
[3:44:46] <brachydios777> That is great
[3:44:46] <$realm_forge> TakeNRG
[3:44:51] <%xmetalicdemonx> @PeachSaliva what are you making?
[3:44:52] <%MugenSandan> yup, onions mushrooms and peppers
[3:44:52] <@PeachSaliva> @DeaconBluesClues Really? I just roll it around the chicken. Takes only ten seconds, really.
[3:45:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt topiary gets WAY better with upgrades
[3:45:14] <andrewofbob> Topiary increases damage received
[3:45:17] <Profmcstevie> Upgrades could make them interesting, who knows
[3:45:18] <StarMechV> That's still two out of a LOT of weapons. Shows how good the arsenal is
[3:45:19] <$BlackMage66652> @PeachSaliva I'd prefer VvcDonald's
[3:45:20] <%sjay662> the void disruptor does not get better
[3:45:20] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Levle them up and youll like them @PatStaresAt
[3:45:21] <Pookiedaexzile> Chefing up some Poultry Pastries
[3:45:28] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Level even
[3:45:30] <+Sendrak70> Theres a good chance that those of those weapons when maxed are awesome and have some very specific uses in fights.
[3:45:30] <@PeachSaliva> @xmetalicdemonx Bacon wrapped baked chicken with brown sugar and papricka! Side of potatos and sauteed spinach!
[3:45:37] <BurningAc3s> chicken gives +1 to charisma
[3:45:40] <%DeaconBluesClues> @peachsaliva i usually am doing bacon wrap with sea scallops and those require you to do it with tooth picks and its finnicky; I should try it with chicken
[3:45:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Is this the second best Mass Effect game
[3:45:52] <cgreene64> that's a very good bounce animation for the lava boys
[3:45:57] <Brothermanhyll> look morty i turned myself into a papRicka
[3:46:00] <@PeachSaliva> @DeaconBluesClues Oh god no, that sounds delish but if you want somethign quick, just wrap it around chicken and voila
[3:46:01] <+tigerfang86> it's thr best mass effect
[3:46:16] <brachydios777> Why does she keep calling him Bolt?
[3:46:20] <Aydarkzero> it's great
[3:46:20] <krabthecrab> Being the best Mass Effect is a low bar
[3:46:23] <%valriot> this is videogame
[3:46:32] <%sjay662> I am glad this game is as good as it is, I was kinda cold on it because 2016 burnt me out on the series
[3:46:34] <Aydarkzero> it's her nickname to him
[3:46:34] <StarMechV> A videogame-ass videogame
[3:46:34] <Brothermanhyll> It's more polite than calling him Nut
[3:46:35] <%shootbang_exe> shootbang_exe subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 22 months! Glad to see you enjoying Rift Apart. Haven't touched a Ratchet game since Deadlocked on the ps2 and this gave me all the good brain chemicals
[3:46:40] <%SolidusRex> Most R&C games are roughly this fun to play, except for the small handful of bad ones
[3:46:41] <ScottyScotch> Ikr
[3:46:41] <mattdaddyd101> Big Fun
[3:46:42] <+ArtsyFoxo> , Paige  going Iron Chef mode
[3:46:46] <+chiazam> @PeachSaliva that sounds like my kinda bacony treat
[3:46:48] <%MugenSandan> can we have cooking camera while Pat streams

[3:46:54] <+FoolsArcade> yeah it kinda is
[3:46:55] <%valriot> Yes
[3:46:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> very muhc, yes
[3:46:56] <+ScrapKingKeita> I've personally had more fun with R&C than any Mario
[3:46:56] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> That sounds fair
[3:46:56] <%radregice> yes
[3:46:57] <+Sendrak70> This game looks like its a good game that does what you want it to, when you want it to.
[3:46:57] <%sjay662> ehhh, kinda
[3:46:57] <+tigerfang86> I guess that tracks
[3:46:58] <auraofdawn> yeah
[3:46:58] <%TheYellowcouch> It's what I would say
[3:46:59] <+KingKrampus> absolutely
[3:46:59] <$daveronald> sure
[3:46:59] <%Dakuu75> I mean, I think it's better than Mario
[3:47:00] <brachydios777> ye
[3:47:01] <+MisdirectionErection> yep
[3:47:01] <Kain5707> for sure
[3:47:01] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> b4tter maybe

[3:47:02] <$BlackMage66652> Yes, with guns
[3:47:04] <%valriot> When its good
[3:47:04] <+chiazam> Yeah kinda
[3:47:05] <Brothermanhyll> It is a flagship franchise yeah
[3:47:05] <%sjay662> I equate it to Sony's Kirby
[3:47:06] <Profmcstevie> No but it's fairly tight fun
[3:47:09] <Cymen90> It is their most successful mascot game
[3:47:09] <+ScrapKingKeita> YEAH
[3:47:10] <Aydarkzero> LUL
[3:47:10] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> most definitely
[3:47:10] <%Ranryu692> Mario without the popularity

[3:47:49] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> it's probably nightmarish without the helmet

[3:48:14] <chimeraxmachina> It‚Äôs basically a chibi to realistic proportions slider
[3:48:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Now all wee need is Jack and Daxter 5
[3:48:19] <%RaziWraith> Ratchet only likes Rivet for her big head :(
[3:48:23] <StarMechV> This theme slaps actually
[3:48:29] <Pookiedaexzile> And Blinx 2
[3:48:31] <+katarjin> These devs seem to like fun
[3:48:32] <+chiazam> @zanzibarian_hamster THE YEAR IS 2021 AND WE HAVE BIG-HEAD MODE BABYEEE
[3:48:33] <%Ranryu692> OMG SUPER FRIENDS IS ON HBO MAX
[3:48:35] <+vaderxyz1970> How many years went into this game?
[3:48:38] <+psychotripstreams> This feels like a real video game with costumes and goofy cheat modes and no microtransactions. What year is this?
[3:48:39] <Profmcstevie> Ratchets gonna think all females lombax got HUGE HEADS
[3:48:47] <Aydarkzero> goons 4 less LUL
[3:48:47] <%AzureGale> Or does Rivet like Ratchet for his big head ;)
[3:48:49] <$RealThiele> she probably gives great helmet
[3:48:56] <Brothermanhyll> vroom goons
[3:48:57] <StarlitStunner> VROOM GOONS
[3:48:57] <+tigerfang86> VROOM GOONS
[3:48:58] <%Ipsenscastle> @Mrbaconator it was more or less annual since the original, they just stepped away for the past few years because they were burnt the fuck out on it
[3:48:59] <%SolidusRex> VROOM GOONS
[3:49:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> aw, it doesn't affect enemies anymore
[3:49:05] <StarMechV> VROOM GOONS
[3:49:06] <Saltmeisterr> VROOM GOONS
[3:49:14] <+Kango234> @psychotripstreams That's always been Insomniac's thing
[3:49:15] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Is she cosplaying Darth Helmet from SpaceBalls?
[3:49:18] <Cymen90> BROS
[3:49:20] <%Dakuu75> bros always travel in herds. lol
[3:49:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Why does Big head mode make this game look slightly more indie
[3:49:34] <andrewofbob> Hand grenade is not the best pick for an AA weapon
[3:49:40] <%TheotherKristian> Jesus fuck the graphics are so expensive
[3:49:40] <chimeraxmachina> Bitches know they can‚Äôt catch me, cute sexy & my ride‚Äôs sporty
[3:49:42] <+TheCrispyBoi> big head mode really fucks with your perspective
[3:49:48] <$RealThiele> Spaceballs: The Flamethrower
[3:49:54] <%SolidusRex> "Kinda cute" Rivet says as she blows the robo mutts to robot hell
[3:49:58] <Brothermanhyll> imagine someone tunes in now and goes like "fuck is this a canon change"
[3:49:59] <%DeaconBluesClues> robogief noi
[3:50:08] <Pookiedaexzile> It makes everything look closer
[3:50:11] <%Ipsenscastle> his head should be grinding along on the floor behind him
[3:50:12] <%AzureGale> NO I DID NOT SEE YOU PLAYING WITH YOUR DOLLS
[3:50:14] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> big head? energy drinks money? 10/10
[3:50:18] <+psychotripstreams> @realthiele The kids LOVE that one
[3:50:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @PatStaresAt it used to affect enemies, which made headshot challenges easy
[3:50:21] <%megadblitz> i never realized how stupid big head mode actually was
[3:50:22] <Cymen90> The big head actually makes me feel nauseous a bit....
[3:50:28] <%barkon345> the big head makes it look like the camera is zoomed in
[3:50:35] <+chiazam> All lava is insta-death
[3:50:36] <StarMechV> Insta-death Lava. ISN'T ALL LAVA INSTA DEATH?
[3:50:39] <AllenDeadman> looking like a funko pop
[3:50:40] <%sjay662> Pat will probably appreciate the side quest on this level
[3:50:44] <romc215> Lemur, wombat, lynx = Lombax
[3:50:44] <+Ghufufin> I SAW YOU PLAYING WITH YOUR DOLLS SHEPPARD!
[3:50:46] <BurningAc3s> pat expert at big head
[3:50:51] <%DeaconBluesClues> this game is really cute

[3:51:05] <+featherlan> @StarMechV No, some of it will KINDA kill you
[3:51:10] <cgreene64> shhhhhh
[3:51:11] <StarMechV> DON'T QUESTION IT
[3:51:12] <+tigerfang86> SHUT UP THO
[3:51:14] <Pookiedaexzile> YOUR HEAD IS HUGE SHEPARD
[3:51:14] <Brothermanhyll> She grinded off screen
[3:51:18] <%MidnightBurst12> dimensional bullshit
[3:51:19] <%AzureGale> She bought them at Space Amazon
[3:51:20] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> are those fish people
[3:51:29] <+featherlan> Remember the days of all games having Big Head mode?
[3:51:32] <KohryuZX> How much do you play as her compared to Ratchet?
[3:51:37] <%legendfather_of_giants> you DONT KNOW that she didn't have them before, she just didn't use them
[3:51:40] <+tigerfang86> lmao
[3:51:45] <%megadblitz> clank you sly BITCH
[3:51:48] <dullvivid> oh clank, you silly cunt
[3:51:49] <StarMechV> Clank is clipping through her head XD
[3:51:50] <$BlackMage66652> @KohryuZX It's 50/50
[3:51:51] <andrewofbob> @KohryuZX It's about 50/50
[3:51:54] <+chiazam> Clank I fucking love you
[3:52:01] <ScottyScotch> Rather it be convenient than force a reason
[3:52:01] <%AzureGale> Rivet didn't have the authorization to use the hoverboots
[3:52:04] <+Punchasaur> She‚Äôs a dimensional counterpart so it kinda makes sense
[3:52:12] <Brothermanhyll> redbullite
[3:52:17] <$RealThiele> turn rocks into energy drinks
[3:52:18] <+TopTieramisu> the baby
[3:52:18] <StarMechV> "I gotta smash your rocks, there's gatorade inside of em"
[3:52:24] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> lol
[3:52:27] <avidneptune> She wasn‚Äôt even there
[3:52:27] <Brothermanhyll> hhhhhhhh
[3:52:28] <chimeraxmachina> It actually makes sense that the lava makes you bounce back. The rapid water evaporation can cause lava to make people fly in the air while burning
[3:52:31] <+chiazam> dimensions, not time travel

[3:53:16] <Hellarussian> take one for the meme
[3:53:19] <%AzureGale> @Ipsenscastle This is funny because Clank is voiced by Megatron :p
[3:53:20] <Profmcstevie> Clanks voice after 1 was fine, as they got to the PS3 games he got a little....slower
[3:53:24] <%RaziWraith> there is a trophy for completing the game with big head mode on the whole time right? :)
[3:53:24] <AllenDeadman> funkopop head-ass
[3:53:25] <Brothermanhyll> Which Lombax is getting the best Head?

[4:14:56] <XeroSigmaPrime> Man imagine FF7 Remake Part 2 with an SSD <3 That open world
[4:15:10] <Pookiedaexzile> As someone who got nosebleeds alot, Blood is not sweet
[4:15:13] <Pookiedaexzile> nor romantic
[4:15:15] <lazysaiyajin> gun good
[4:15:16] <JetpackMcQuack> load screens are a really good fix to prioritize
[4:15:21] <+vaderxyz1970> @goyak like a Snickers bar?
[4:15:25] <romc215> BOB! DO SOMETHIN!
[4:15:30] <Meltgar> Blood is blood, but Khorne would appreciate that Kappa
[4:15:32] <+katarjin> and loading eleveator
[4:15:34] <@commanderclaw> And the Uncharted SQUEEZE
[4:15:35] <SaltyAzteca> Like loading elevators
[4:15:36] <%Ranryu692> rip elevators in games lol
[4:15:38] <$RealThiele> elevators
[4:15:41] <+featherlan> I miss loading screen minigames
[4:15:42] <%Delenay> mp4 now with longer loading screen elevators
[4:15:45] <@commanderclaw> Remember all those times you have to squeeze through shit?
[4:15:46] <Aydarkzero> plot twist ff7r will still keep that LUL
[4:15:48] <+MisterAvry> member when you had to do a loading screen to cross to the other side of Vice City?
[4:15:49] <Profmcstevie> FF7R had terrible designs for load masking
[4:15:52] <ScottyScotch> Rip ME1 elevator ride
[4:15:54] <%Ipsenscastle> when the rocks are too close together and you have to squeeze through so the level can load in
[4:15:54] <avidneptune> Narrow gaps
[4:16:07] <+Punchasaur> Blood is metallic and not good for eating
[4:16:10] <Meltgar> @featherlan why noone aside from those DBZ game have loading minigames?
[4:16:12] <Profmcstevie> Mass Effect elevator is good load masking, it's a chance to vibe with the party and listen to comms
[4:16:24] <SaltyAzteca> Shadow realm really do be evil
[4:16:34] <%Delenay> gem on right
[4:16:49] <Pookiedaexzile> Member when you had to ride an elevator in the Normandy to load the upper and lower levels
[4:16:52] <Profmcstevie> Namco patented "loading minigames" and it only ran out semi recently
[4:16:58] <+featherlan> @Meltgar Bandai/Namco had a trademark or copyright on the concept, so no other game studios could do them
[4:17:01] <+Dia_Dar> coincidentally weren't concealed loading screens introduced by ,aughty dog's jak & daxter ? with the boat travels ?
[4:17:06] <Meltgar> WOW that fucking SUCKS
[4:17:21] <%Delenay> well you missed an upgrade gem in there
[4:17:25] <Profmcstevie> Game designers inventing patents are cringe
[4:17:27] <Aydarkzero> @Dia_Dar boat in 1 the metroid door opening in 2/3
[4:17:34] <%AzureGale> Metroid Prime hid loading screens with door openings
[4:17:39] <Pookiedaexzile> Namco literally made games worse for everyone else
[4:17:40] <Aristotlay> Tony Hawk American Wasteland or whatever had those loading screen hallways
[4:17:43] <Aydarkzero> ^
[4:17:44] <%HunguyTV> You can boot the most recent save from the cards on the ps5 os and its crazy fast
[4:17:45] <chimeraxmachina> Copyrights like that are laaame
[4:17:48] <+featherlan> It was a big suck, and now games load so fast; we missed out on a whole era of potential load screen minigames
[4:17:53] <%Ipsenscastle> fuck namco
[4:17:59] <$RealThiele> good ol' PS1 SotN CD rooms
[4:18:07] <%Ipsenscastle> they wasted so much of our cumulative time
[4:18:13] <+Punchasaur> No need for loading mini games if you don‚Äôt spend any time loading

[4:34:59] <Slimeking_Mike> Gary, Second Prophet of Oxtos
[4:35:02] <Aydarkzero> @legendfather_of_giants glad somebody else thinks so
[4:35:03] <%SolidusRex> Guys, not only does the Plumber fucks, the Plumber fucks lizard women
[4:35:04] <%valriot> For people unaware, The Plumber is in every Ratchet and Clank game and just appears in random places fixing the plumbing
[4:35:08] <+Punchasaur> His dad is Mario
[4:35:24] <%SolidusRex> No, Clank's dad is Mario
[4:35:38] <%SolidusRex> Seriously, Charles Martinet voiced Clank's dad in ACIT
[4:35:44] <+Punchasaur> His mom is Bowsette
[4:36:01] <emMmDeeKay> @SolidusRex Yeah in Mario vs Donkey Kong there where mini robot marios right?
[4:36:09] <avidneptune> The plumber usually shows up and either breaks the 4th wall or gives them a mcguffin they won‚Äôt know they need until the end of the game.
[4:36:12] <MrRevocs1256> Fun Fact: Clank is voiced by Beast Wars Megatron

[4:52:52] <+Punchasaur> Why‚Äôs she scared she has every gun
[4:52:53] <Profmcstevie> Hey that dead space man dev is working on something, we never know
[4:52:55] <bigshedman> Too bad Dead Space 3 only sold a few million copies instead of 20 million
[4:52:55] <+Buzzkill983> Sad dead space being... dead
[4:52:59] <Sol_Install> EA really push that series to shit
[4:52:59] <@commanderclaw> Remember when Command and Conquer was good? Remember when Mercenaries was good? Remember when Sim City was good?
[4:53:01] <+vaderxyz1970> I too miss Isaacs 1000 ton boots
[4:53:01] <JetpackMcQuack> We always have ds1
[4:53:03] <$realm_forge> Or cyber bully EA
[4:53:03] <chimeraxmachina> What happened to the dead space IP?
[4:53:04] <+Dia_Dar> deep space ambient deafening silence of dead space and the magnetic boots sections boots
[4:53:14] <Pookiedaexzile> @Shillk Now that's a name I haven't heard in years
[4:53:16] <Tracazoid> *Remember when *Insert EA, Ubisoft or Blizzard game was good"* Yeah, good times
[4:53:17] <+featherlan> When are we gonna get a spiritual successor that goes where Visceral wanted the original...?
[4:53:18] <marcomatame> 50% should be passing, but grades should be more honest. A lot of 70s should be 40s, lets be real
[4:53:20] <juanrock89> Fuck EA
[4:53:20] <Aydarkzero> yes
[4:53:22] <Sol_Install> no
[4:53:22] <romc215> You know what old game would be awesome to bring back in a style like this? Kid Chameleon.
[4:53:25] <+RowenCleric> dead space 1 is better
[4:53:26] <Sol_Install> i rather not
[4:53:26] <%MidnightBurst12> no
[4:53:27] <%valriot> 3 was okay
[4:53:27] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt remember you have jet boots
[4:53:27] <+Punchasaur> EA happened
[4:53:29] <SaltyAzteca> This is the dumb timeline
[4:53:31] <+Dia_Dar> DEAD SPACE 3 teh action adventure game ?!
[4:53:34] <+Buzzkill983> Dead Space 3: Snowy Boogaloo
[4:53:36] <emMmDeeKay> You guys remember Dead Space Extraction
[4:53:37] <1matheuw> there is no 3 pat
[4:53:39] <%Tearonex> shame they didn't make a dead space 3
[4:53:40] <+smallboops> shut up about old game good, new game gooder :V
[4:53:41] <lazysaiyajin> dead space esport
[4:53:43] <Pookiedaexzile> @valriot 3 was not okay
[4:53:44] <brachydios777> Sadly yes
[4:53:48] <AllenDeadman> I want to forget
[4:53:50] <bigshedman> DS3 wasn't even that bad, it's more that you could totally feeld EA's hands all over it.
[4:53:50] <jorniev> EA has always happened to good companies
[4:53:54] <andrewofbob> I find it odd that Dead Space and Lost Planet swaps aesthetics in their 3rd entries
[4:54:00] <%BarujaraciGaming> fuck dead space 3 and fuck ea
[4:54:01] <Mr_implosion> Dead space 3 atpCap
[4:54:08] <ergulor> and is here

[4:54:12] <%ShogunNoonto> I miss lost planetI
[4:54:15] <Aydarkzero> I didn't hate dead space 3 but it was missing quality like 1 and 2
[4:54:27] <%valriot> @pookiedaexzile 3 wad okay via the definition of okay
[4:54:33] <+Pilau32> i bet starfield isnt gonna be this god
[4:54:35] <1matheuw> this looks pretty cool ngl

[4:57:04] <%Ranryu692> has she even met Ratchet?
[4:57:08] <+Valison> that's some expensive lombussy
[4:57:11] <Pookiedaexzile> the Game Artist didn't use 100 percent opacity on the linework and left rough lines in
[4:57:14] <brachydios777> Nefarious is a Necron , right?
[4:57:15] <%psidefx> I missed it all
[4:57:15] <Pookiedaexzile> That's that real shit son
[4:57:15] <%MelBrooksKA> It just occurred to me that EA and Activision both kill their franchises the same way by throwing them into the shooter mines
[4:57:16] <ScreamLord> Or the omnipotent Plumber
[4:57:20] <1matheuw> but I just arived
[4:57:21] <%Tearonex> good place to stop
[4:57:23] <1matheuw> =[

[4:58:07] <$BlackMage66652> @Monkeyweed21 I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE
[4:58:08] <chimeraxmachina> Many thanks for the awesome stream pat and also many thanks to the chat for being absolutely wild tonight
[4:58:20] <%barrakuta371> and the shelves
[4:58:39] <%Monkeyweed21> Floor 9 is for real on PC
[4:58:41] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[4:58:43] <%kewlmyc> Yeah, floor system is great. It's just the Habbo Hotel shit that's annoying
[4:58:49] <i_chevalier> @patstaresat When are you gonna start calling Paige. "Ma!" like a western settler. lol
[4:58:58] <Profmcstevie> The floor system is....just basically ranked isn't it? Is there any real difference between calling someone Floor 5 or a Silver rank
[4:59:16] <%AzureGale> Atelier
[4:59:24] <$Ziegsy> Legend of heroes if you want TO FEEL
[4:59:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @Profmcstevie you dont get matched against higher floors in GG Strive, unlike other rank systems where you run into killers more often
[5:00:01] <chimeraxmachina> Aw pat sleepy
[5:00:10] <Profmcstevie> so no crossing the streams, gotcha
[5:00:23] <%Broand> IF you win 5 times in a row, you go up I find
[5:00:33] <+Punchasaur> Numbers
[5:00:33] <Aydarkzero> skill based matchmaking?
[5:00:50] <Aydarkzero> neat
[5:00:55] <%Monkeyweed21> within 5 to 10 matches
[5:01:04] <SaltyAzteca> Heaven really is empty BibleThump
[5:01:10] <Profmcstevie> Lonely in Heaven
[5:01:12] <%kewlmyc> For now. I'm sure the opposite will be true in like 4 months
[5:02:04] <romc215> Too many
[5:02:07] <%Monkeyweed21> Lombaxes have 7 cloacas but only 5 penises
[5:02:09] <%kewlmyc> 10%
[5:02:09] <+Punchasaur> Heaven is empty because no one deserves to be there
[5:02:09] <Aydarkzero> it's a sad reality
[5:02:10] <SaltyAzteca> We may never know
[5:02:10] <%Dregon_Azure> i dont wanna know lol
[5:02:11] <%Arancet> im considering getting this one, never played a r&c before
[5:02:12] <%psidefx> more than 30-40 tbh
[5:02:14] <%AzureGale> More than should be
[5:02:15] <%NopeBadguy> i'll scalp them instead
[5:02:16] <+Pharmakokinetic> there were estimates that 25% of nbew consoles are scalped
[5:02:18] <%Bane_Kaikyo> that's depressing
[5:02:18] <%psidefx> percent
[5:02:21] <%MidnightBurst12> that thought is upsetting
[5:02:22] <%kewlmyc> It is
[5:02:25] <s1rcuit> BibleThump
[5:02:26] <jorniev> LIKE half of the number produced last year
[5:02:27] <Profmcstevie> Considering how often stocks just DISAPPEAR within minutes.....a lot
[5:02:29] <%Zeikier> Lots
[5:02:41] <BigNerdSam> Am I cynic for saying "36%?"
[5:02:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> I mean, once stock ramps up those people are fucked
[5:02:50] <romc215> That's why I laugh when scalpers complain that no one is buying their over priced bullshit
[5:02:51] <%dio96> There's over 8M PS5s out there so that'd be pretty huge, yeah.
[5:02:58] <%HunguyTV> ive managed to get mine during a local retailer restock back in december and i feel blessed
[5:03:01] <+Punchasaur> I bet I won‚Äôt be able to get one within a year
[5:03:05] <Aydarkzero> i'd hate my self even more if i bought from a scalper
[5:03:05] <%legendfather_of_giants> the question is how long thatll take
[5:03:13] <Profmcstevie> 70 dollar games
[5:03:15] <BigNerdSam> Sony makes more money on software than PS5 hardware
[5:03:18] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL imagine it being that cheap from a scalper
[5:03:28] <+RaveBV> It's bad for all devs. They now have to market under the idea people don't own the consoles they made license deals to be exclusives on.
[5:03:34] <%Zeikier> guess they better crack down on piracy instead of scalpers zeikieRage
[5:03:34] <juanrock89> The game is all Lombussy
[5:03:39] <andrewofbob> Retailers are throwing up anti-bot tech so that they also have a market to sell games to
[5:03:42] <+vaderxyz1970> your not trying hard enough for the lombussy
[5:03:44] <%TIME_PUNCHER> TIME_PUNCHER subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! I can't take my dog to the park anymore, ducks keep biting him. I should've known this would happen since he's pure bread.
[5:03:45] <+RaveBV> SE fucked itself with intergrade, since not many own a PS5.. at least not as many as they hoped.
[5:03:47] <BigNerdSam> @Profmcstevie PS4 games too, my friend is still mad at me for showing him Monster Hunter World loadtimes on PS5.
[5:03:48] <%cvp5127> LUL

[5:03:56] <%MidnightBurst12> respect

[5:03:56] <Ner234> NotLikeThis I hate this
[5:03:58] <%cvp5127> money is money
[5:03:58] <%Dakuu75> Yeah, I think this is the first game, I really wish I had a PS5 for
[5:04:00] <SaltyAzteca> i respect the hustle
[5:04:01] <%kewlmyc> I don't like any of that
[5:04:03] <Profmcstevie> Police can't catch him
[5:04:03] <auraofdawn> It took a couple friends of mine 3-4 months to get their PS5s legit
[5:04:07] <bob900000> nice
