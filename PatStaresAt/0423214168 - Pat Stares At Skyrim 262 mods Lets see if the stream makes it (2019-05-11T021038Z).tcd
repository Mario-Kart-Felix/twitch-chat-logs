[0:10:25] <FunkyStreams> I'm actually going to say because of these foliage mods the game enviroment looks a bit cluttered
[0:10:25] <jerkhov_> I have never seen anyone do stealth and archery
[0:10:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> so what build are you going for? stealth archer? how about stealtc archer? or an archer, but made for stealth? how about a warrior, that eventually becomes a stealth archer?

[0:11:00] <dekkitout> There's builds aside from stealth archer?
[0:11:00] <%MagickBurritoh> COWARD CLASS
[0:11:01] <%JJCheeker> Yes starting a new playthrough this game is a chore
[0:11:03] <%Strider222> @callsigneagle01 of course I'm hyped.
[0:11:03] <CrematedCube> You can also just do the quest and be like "surprise I did it"
[0:11:04] <+d00msdaydan> he knows everyone who plays skyrim well
[0:11:04] <Aydarkzero> a warrior archer
[0:11:06] <+ssulcer> Arch Stealther?
[0:11:08] <+tigerfang86> whast a bout a wizard that learns stealth magic, and also bowmanship
[0:11:09] <haisho> All roads in vanilla Skyrim lead to Stealth Archer
[0:11:09] <+maybefalco> stealth archer is the only class
[0:11:10] <+Robopengy> How's the game goin'?
[0:11:10] <%irziggo> stealth archer is easy mode
[0:11:10] <anotheronionguy> Big coward
[0:11:15] <+beekay579> no cube tonight
[0:11:15] <$Slimshazbot> honestly this texture mod looks assssssss
[0:11:16] <Huntercd> Vampire stealth archer
[0:11:16] <MrVgmaster> Use the Faendal glitch
[0:11:17] <%Diabetic> this game is a divine miracle running on the Switch
[0:11:17] <alrobot2014> why is stealth archer so optimal
[0:11:19] <+beekay579> im sad
[0:11:19] <$MajorCrasher> Pat is forever coward
[0:11:21] <callsigneagle01> @Strider222 the most evilest character ever in the AC universe
[0:11:22] <dekkitout> How bout a mage- that summons a bow and uses muffle?
[0:11:22] <+katarjin> Illusion mage....stleah archer
[0:11:23] <%spiritofmojave> Unarmed or go home--mostly just go home because this game's combat has no goddamn variety
[0:11:27] <%Laecerelius> More for Pat!
[0:11:28] <BreakTheBarrier> *continues to drink it*
[0:11:28] <Ultra_Pancake> Is there any other way to play Skyrim than a stealth archer??
[0:11:29] <$Tuskor13> I typically prefer a stealth mage with knife that eventually caves and gets Bound Bow and devolves back into Stealth Archer
[0:11:30] <Pookiedaexzile> Be a Bard
[0:11:30] <+Nomicro4u> THATS HOW YOU KNOW IT WORKing
[0:11:32] <%manwithboxonhead> How about assassin.
[0:11:33] <goodpuddin3> sell page
[0:11:33] <%hawk_rush> nauseous because of the PREGANT??
[0:11:34] <callsigneagle01> he's gonna have to one-up Grabacr nuking half the cities on earth
[0:11:35] <starotter70> Continues to drink it
[0:11:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> Sell Paige to me
[0:11:37] <callsigneagle01> or trying to
[0:11:38] <$MajorCrasher> even Paige knows REDBULL is awful
[0:11:38] <VJdarkworld> Isnt stealth archer the most meta of meta builds?
[0:11:39] <%Strider222> @callsigneagle01 probably belkan lol
[0:11:40] <FunkyStreams> sneaky mage build is fun too
[0:11:40] <lotharrio> Stealth archer is solid. Big coward strength. But how about you go for an unarmed build?
[0:11:41] <+overlordofbones> sugar free redbull is gross tho
[0:11:42] <%THATGUY_789> Natural Selection always reward the cowards
[0:11:43] <%TheKillerKalamari> Everyone starts off wanting to be anything but a stealth archer, but always end up a stealth archer, so it's pointless to try to build anything else
[0:11:43] <+sora8745> But what if you need that crap later???
[0:11:43] <jerkhov_> illusion is big brain archer
[0:11:45] <%Axel6561> why be a stealth archer when you can just go stealth archer?
[0:11:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I got weird caffeine shakes after having a red bull once, never again
[0:11:45] <+TheWallOfMeat> You won't even use the potions tho
[0:11:46] <%FrustratedAF> my buddy once gave me a good loot tip: only take what you can get 10x gold per weight
[0:11:48] <majindusto> DONT SELL RED AQUA BibleThump
[0:11:50] <%HyperCharge_Sam> ewwww whats wrong with his face
[0:11:50] <%ItsRatman> Theres really no reason NOT to carry a bow and arrow
[0:11:51] <blackbeaking> paige did you ever read the crimson petal and white sequel? if so was it good?
[0:11:52] <%Strider222> @callsigneagle01 good thing I got the season pass with the CE
[0:11:53] <Wibit> Go conjuring. Then summon a bow for stealth archery
[0:11:54] <Pookiedaexzile> Be a Warlock with levels in mage
[0:11:54] <%LouieRouie> That's how you know it's working
[0:11:56] <+LucentWulf> so @AngriestPat how many creepy sex mods did you install
[0:11:59] <+LowBatteryLife> Red Bull is an acquired taste. It helps if you start with vodka, then move to red bull, then mix the two.
[0:11:59] <callsigneagle01> @Strider222 I honestly hope not man, it's such a meme at this point
[0:11:59] <Sydin18> S.Archer that becomes a mage.
[0:12:01] <Zer0beats> the claw
[0:12:02] <+SuichiTanaka> I'm the idiot that went pure mage in a vanilla Skyrim playthrough

[0:21:04] <%Strider222> @callsigneagle01 Yeah the Raven is kinda like the Falken. Nosferatu or Fenrir would have been cool. Yeah more RL planes would have been cool, especially more ground attackers like the Su-25
[0:21:04] <+Zombiemowlcher> Takes you to marker
[0:21:08] <alcors_wisdom> when you think about it skyrim has not gold or copper denominations of coin so gold is essentially the same as pennies in this world
[0:21:09] <ExemplarKyle> Stealth + Arrows = You win the game
[0:21:11] <Atzros> Translation: He as mods he's ashamed of in the list

[0:39:34] <a_c_chirns> @AngriestPat which mod adds the crossbows?
[0:39:35] <%hawk_rush> chest
[0:39:36] <%WackyGear> @AngriestPat you missed a chest
[0:39:37] <jerkhov_> crossbows weren't added until dawnguard for some reason
[0:39:37] <NumbusPlays> blind confirmed, missed the chest
[0:39:38] <dsauce999> blind as fuck
[0:39:39] <%laserbeaming> Crossbows have that busted armor piercing stuff
[0:39:40] <%NovaKnightmare> @AngriestPat got a list of these mods for peeps who wanna play thru themselves?
[0:39:41] <%Jetsfantasy> They don't get all the multipliers though, do they?
[0:39:43] <RantingRavager> Does @AngriestPat have big tiddy anime girl mods?
[0:39:43] <%wolfofsound> NotLikeThis
[0:39:44] <takokasa> dawnguard adds crossbows
[0:39:46] <%Mornaka> @reiju_22 just heavily moded
[0:39:47] <ccrida> @reiju_22 vampire DLC added crossbows
[0:39:47] <Darren716> Pat you missed the locker

[0:39:55] <Tennochief> Ah Skyrim
[0:39:58] <%benjiFG> oh no I'm getting reminded of the chalice dungeons
[0:39:58] <dsauce999> This is going to be a good stream
[0:39:59] <killaholic89> crossbows are also louder but get sneak multis too
[0:40:00] <haisho> you missed it every time
[0:40:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> hope we don't run into any draugur. those things are rare and dangerous!
[0:40:01] <kvnmck94> @RantingRavager Pat is the big tiddy anime girl
[0:40:01] <%wolfofsound> 1
[0:40:01] <%Laecerelius> I figured he was going to get it later
[0:40:05] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat's mod setup is too complex to post a list. At least so far.
[0:40:05] <EASrake> GOLD ON TABLE Kappa
[0:40:05] <%decisivelynameless> So why're we playing Skyrim and not Dragon's Dogma
[0:40:06] <FunkyStreams> that is the jankiest looking skyrim ive ever seen
[0:40:06] <+Spec7re> 1
[0:40:07] <%GarbageNirvana> One doesn't simply "beat" Skyrim
[0:40:07] <CloudCircus> Why don’t pat and Paige cuddle more?
[0:40:08] <Sloavon> 1
[0:40:10] <+linSP> this fov is a little cramped
[0:40:10] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@ccrida) (warning)
[0:40:11] <$abluecardigan> >not using the lockpicking cheat mod
[0:40:11] <%mh9s> pat you are the worst Skyrimmer
[0:40:11] <RantingRavager> @kvnmck94 PogChamp

[0:40:18] <Werjer> it's why we show up, pat the blind coward
[0:40:20] <jerkhov_> was that a custom lock image?
[0:40:22] <ItsKitKat_> @PlagueOfGripes And those mythic dragons
[0:40:25] <AnacondaVirtue> @AngriestPat Ultimate Combat has an option to make stealth a bit more difficult, if you wanna try that. Could make things more interesting
[0:40:27] <%WackyGear> hreat skyriming @AngriestPat
[0:40:28] <haisho> your Skyrim cred is falling apart
[0:40:29] <%spiritofmojave> Pat's not experienced in Skyrimjobs
[0:40:29] <ccrida> @PlagueOfGripes looks like a butt to me
[0:40:29] <FunkyStreams> accuire more skyrim
[0:40:30] <takokasa> Because Warriors in Dragon's Dogma are the coolest class but are weak as shit because they only have 3 skills
[0:40:31] <jerkhov_> because the baby
[0:40:32] <+Nomicro4u> Cuddle Elmo
[0:40:32] <SubjectX07x> Breh.
[0:40:33] <%MagickBurritoh> LEWD
[0:40:34] <%JJCheeker> Why does that lock have Balls
[0:40:34] <%nikoloas_> cause cuddling is gross
[0:40:34] <%mh9s> gross
[0:40:34] <ReelDeath> Pat is drunk on skyrim
[0:40:35] <$Tuskor13> @killaholic89 guy in chat said gold on table GOLDONTABLE
[0:40:36] <+tigerfang86> cause they're RELATED
[0:40:38] <%driemen> gamer cube doesn't allow it
[0:40:40] <+MonsieurHedge> they DO cuddle... they cuddle EMLO
[0:40:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's incidental
[0:40:42] <%logoth_> Ewwww ghey
[0:40:43] <gustavozxd> cause that's gay
[0:40:43] <+Nomicro4u> WHOS HONKING
[0:40:44] <%spiritofmojave> Disgusting
[0:40:44] <Dfreddy8> Pats ALWAYS drunk
[0:40:45] <%laserbeaming> @AngriestPat Not to trigger the goblins, but there's tons of chests in Skyrim that are quite hidden and you might've missed every single time.
[0:40:45] <rytisone> I'd watch that
[0:40:45] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> cuddle the fuck out in that gamer cube.
[0:40:45] <alwayspronking> LUL HONK HONK
[0:40:46] <+Spec7re> Honk that bag!
[0:40:46] <+Deepfriedhamster> the cuddle with genitals
[0:40:47] <+senfood> Cuddles are for Elmo.
[0:40:48] <Dhurkst> LEWD
[0:40:48] <%decisivelynameless> @takokasa you can mod it on PC so they have 6 skills
[0:40:48] <%Strider222> @callsigneagle01 In Ace 4 and 5 there were no assault records right?
[0:40:49] <Desertfishing> cuddling on stream is weird as fuck
[0:40:51] <callsigneagle01> Why is Paige a goose now?
[0:40:51] <@lewdskeletor13> woolieOMG
[0:40:51] <%WackyGear> dragons dogma is the shit
[0:40:51] <jerkhov_> twitch is prude also PDA Kappa
[0:40:51] <+LowBatteryLife> Honk those balls.
[0:40:51] <%LouieRouie> It would be sweet
[0:40:52] <Crankthulhu> Wait, is Paige honking Pat's boobs?
[0:40:53] <%terribleusername> don't honk the bepis
[0:40:53] <%TheSniperJoe> I feel like I've SEEN you cuddle on stream before but that might just be my perception of your great relationship, manifesting false memories.
[0:40:54] <kvnmck94> do it, but make thsoe exact sound effects
[0:40:54] <+BoomerTiro> Who is honking!
[0:40:55] <%Mornaka> hmm
[0:40:55] <$MajorCrasher> it's because Pat despises human contact
[0:40:55] <vingadivo> paige is his sibling why would they cuddle eww
[0:40:55] <VJdarkworld> HONK HONK
[0:40:55] <+Estuko> You gotta accidentally cuddle, fall into her arms pat
[0:40:56] <%wolfofsound> You can't cuddle in the cube
[0:40:56] <%Shadowtalon77> honk honk
[0:40:56] <Tennochief> @PlagueOfGripes Mimics keep their balls outside the chest
[0:40:56] <starotter70> I mean you guys basically already do that

The most interesting was the one that was a former member of Gault team that survived, moved to Estovakia, and helped build the Aigaion and was subsequently shot down by Garuda Team

[0:44:07] <Maids4lyfe> you have to level up your melee first
[0:44:08] <callsigneagle01> you stop it
[0:44:10] <+BoomerTiro> None of our melee advice matters since the combat has been completely changed and we don't know how his hands work anymore
[0:44:10] <Sloavon> dawnguard is a good Bloodlines 2 prep
[0:44:10] <Calamity2007> @AngriestPat what difficulty are you playing on?

[0:44:15] <+Th3SmartAlec> @Flare3500 strikes again
[0:44:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> how about a mod that makes enemies loudly flatulate when they die
[0:44:15] <3xgilly> Skyrim = first person shooter
[0:44:15] <FunkyStreams> yeah 3 kill streak! take that Paige! you and your mustard infused melee weapons...
[0:44:16] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Get the zweihander and become sneaky William Wallace!
[0:44:16] <%Promessa_EX> you should really combo the bow with magic or one handed

[0:44:24] <%deviljhojho94> tomatoRat I will shove you into a locker dweeb
[0:44:25] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 2 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 8oz (240mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[0:44:26] <ItsKitKat_> So this is gonna be one of these kind of fail-throughs huh @AngriestPat
[0:44:27] <Smart_ZaK1> You don't have it yet
[0:44:29] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat has so many mods though, we don't know exactly what's changes
[0:44:29] <%Keaton_x> 262 mods and not one that removes that stupid spinning death animation...
[0:44:32] <TheOriginOfAll> @AngriestPat i love you please marru me

[0:44:43] <+LiveStreamOnyx> I just want Thomas the Tank Engine bardW
[0:44:45] <VJdarkworld> Wild Rat mod
[0:44:48] <dsauce999> wildcat makes pat take 2.5 times more damage than normal
[0:44:48] <+Spec7re> Now i need to choose whether to play skyrim or watch it, what a conundrum
[0:44:48] <@PlagueOfGripes> ballsack lock
[0:44:48] <Flare3500> install the Rengar mod
[0:44:48] <%Luna_Ashford> I thought you said you had ultimate combat?
[0:44:51] <takokasa> The mod that makes dying enemies make the wilhelm scream is the best mod
[0:44:56] <callsigneagle01> @Strider222 6 was peak cheese, but it was super good. Also a lot of people say it had the best gameplay and I find it hard to argue
[0:44:58] <haisho> now Pat must make his way back to his worst enemy: THE SKEEVER
[0:44:59] <%logoth_> Is the ballsack mod installed
[0:44:59] <ccrida> @PlagueOfGripes It's a butt
[0:45:00] <Hoisengineer> that lock does have a nutsack

[0:45:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten :( apatFist
[0:45:05] <%laserbeaming> Wildcat is a little excessive in some things. Smidolon is a toned down version of it.
[0:45:05] <dsauce999> pat has both wildcat and ultimate combat
[0:45:07] <redial_nick> potion of quick shot
[0:45:08] <+Nomicro4u> There needs to be some sort of punishment for Pat getting Elmo killed

[1:16:30] <%dreampipe332> Elmo, I tell you I'm going into battle
[1:16:31] <+absolute_cagemony> OMG IM HERE...how much "erotic content" have i missed?
[1:16:32] <+IronPickle> Why did you side with the Empire. Those assholes just tried to kill you for crossing the boarder
[1:16:34] <%Verd_254> i need a skyrim mod that basically turns the combat into mount and blade
[1:16:35] <+waxingbarelyrical> Faendal trains archery
[1:16:37] <+TeraMercier> To anybody who cares: Pat won't do the mod 'install guide' he did for NV, but with a lot of texture mods, just exporting the load order wouldn't be a full list. AFAIK Vortex doesn't have a convenient full mod list output
[1:16:38] <deadguyisdead> you can't handle my strongest potions
[1:16:42] <$Tuskor13> My potions are too strong for you traveler
[1:16:45] <+6PoundsofShrimp> Oh wow this is sopretty
[1:16:45] <Dhurkst> @AngriestPat I'm digging the music. What are the mods?
[1:16:49] <nerdblase> James Woods?

[1:17:05] <%NovaKnightmare> sell him drugs
[1:17:06] <%ItsRatman> Steal. It. Back.
[1:17:10] <dekkitout> Yup, he places it- on a counter top
[1:17:11] <Seraphile> huh he does look like nines
[1:17:12] <%Agami23> damn the claw looks awesome
[1:17:13] <%gsun103> this music is really out of place lol
[1:17:19] <+absolute_cagemony> Is pat using Schlongs of Skyrim for that immersion?
[1:17:23] <%laserbeaming> Don't sell enchanted stuff, disenchant it instead
[1:17:24] <+TeraMercier> He's packing a deagle under that tunic
[1:17:31] <shotgang86> did you apply the rich merchants mod?
[1:17:34] <%DigitalJoshie> man watching these mods makes me realize how drape vanilla skyrim is
[1:17:39] <shotgang86> this is one of those essential mods
[1:17:46] <Cymen90> SPEECH
[1:17:51] <+TeraMercier> I always just console 10000 gold onto any npc who runs out
[1:17:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Does pat know about Reshader?
[1:17:53] <+griffball13> @AngriestPat do you think its weird for kajhet to where fur stuff
[1:17:59] <callsigneagle01> now rob them
[1:17:59] <+6PoundsofShrimp> are we playing everytime Pat kills someone they have to stop combat and loot the body immedately
[1:18:03] <+TeraMercier> People get rich when my character is in town
[1:18:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Pat you look like an Aragon cosplayer.
[1:18:04] <%laserbeaming> Yeah, mods are kinda necessary for Skyrim, once you go Modded, you can't go back
[1:18:14] <callsigneagle01> When was Aragorn a cat?
[1:18:18] <+SuichiTanaka> Magic is just unusable in vanilla Skyrim
[1:18:20] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> fuck his sister and make cat babies
[1:18:27] <+SuichiTanaka> it requires mods to even be a functioning build
[1:18:27] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You're not going to the right conventions

[1:18:54] <$Tuskor13> @griffball13 leather is just tanned skin isnt it? isnt humans wearing leather just like khajiit wearing fur
[1:18:54] <+TeraMercier> Free smithing skill by asking for the tutorial
[1:18:55] <shotgang86> yeah makes sense that merchant has like 200 gold without mods. I used it and applied the x10 modifier
[1:18:56] <Xgwill222> Whoa, I've actually never played an Elder Scrolls game.

[1:20:05] <+TeraMercier> Hey Pat, this notice board mod will send you all over the map. The Missives mod keeps all those posted quests within the same hold
[1:20:06] <MrVgmaster> CICERO
[1:20:06] <%spacedroner1> Cicero
[1:20:06] <Rashnam> What IS bird? coxBut
[1:20:07] <%spiritofmojave> Cicero is alright
[1:20:07] <Huntercd> Serana is great for stealth
[1:20:07] <alrobot2014> Cicero
[1:20:07] <Dhurkst> @Xgwill222 I'd recommend starting with Oblivion. More robust than Skyrim, more beginner-friendly than Morrowing
[1:20:08] <a_c_chirns> birds aren't real
[1:20:08] <%Niney_Who> Fucking Cicero
[1:20:08] <%Strider222> is that a crab?
[1:20:09] <%spacedroner1> Best companion
[1:20:10] <%Order_of_Mystery> Cicero
[1:20:10] <Tennochief> Cicero?
[1:20:11] <+IronPickle> They're basically just a mule
[1:20:12] <$eldritchbee> Cicero, the Worst Companion
[1:20:13] <lotharrio> Yeah but werewolf powers.
[1:20:14] <%StarDiamond1> cicero
[1:20:15] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @kingra that's so good omg
[1:20:15] <%spacedroner1> Cicero or Serana
[1:20:15] <%gsun103> there's no really memorable followers in skyrim
[1:20:16] <+BoomerTiro> Armored Trolls from Dawnguard don't break your stealth
[1:20:17] <%Niney_Who> "That's not a horker, that's MY WIFE"
[1:20:18] <%Laecerelius> She's pretty great
[1:20:19] <Tennochief> cute crab
[1:20:21] <indig0bird> Serana
[1:20:24] <+SuichiTanaka> in the vanilla game there's basically 6 damage spells, which don't scale in damage, and require lots of heavily enchanted gear to function.
[1:20:24] <alrobot2014> Laura Bailey is always a great companion
[1:20:25] <+LunarLancaster> Serena, Aela and Cicero are the stealth companions
[1:20:26] <+Estuko> PogChamp Vampire wife
[1:20:27] <MrVgmaster> Cicero is best boi
[1:20:27] <skeletonknifefight> serana best gril
[1:20:27] <suikudo> Lura baily is best waifu
[1:20:28] <callsigneagle01> I hated him
[1:20:28] <NotHereToStream> kill jester
[1:20:29] <Desertfishing> kill jesta
[1:20:29] <haisho> Paige confirmed a cold blooded killer
[1:20:30] <%spacedroner1> Serana is a hot goth waifu
[1:20:33] <$eldritchbee> Hes SO annoying i hate him so much
[1:20:33] <%Niney_Who> Kill jesta
[1:20:34] <ooblag> No human being has ever said the words "I love Cicero" before this moment
[1:20:34] <TheLeadingTone> wait is this witcher music?
[1:20:35] <+Grayhammatter> serana best gril
[1:20:37] <+linSP> the vinesauce companion combo
[1:20:37] <+6PoundsofShrimp> We stormclock or imperal bois?
[1:20:37] <starotter70> Kill Jesta
[1:20:40] <+Verdenfert> the problem with cicero is that he has like 4 lines'
[1:20:40] <Zalthia> @gsun103 Erandur and Serenia are pretty good, but Erandur looses his personality after his quest :T
[1:20:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat's a loner. A hard edge anti-hero. You wouldn't understand.
[1:20:43] <%Ynkubus18> kill jester
[1:20:43] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Cicero is trash
[1:20:44] <Raudive> kill jesta
[1:20:45] <+absolute_cagemony> What ENB is he using? Anyone know?
[1:20:45] <Dogmaticjoe> my favorite companion was your fan from oblivion
[1:20:45] <dekkitout> Cicero is a fine short fellow
[1:20:46] <Huntercd> Laura Bailey wuff wuff
[1:20:47] <+neuwaive> how do people like serana?
[1:20:47] <+Thunder_Poo> Pat, is Elmo going to become a Vampire or Wearwolf?
[1:20:48] <Tennochief> Imperials rule
[1:20:48] <%StarDiamond1> how the hell do Armored Trolls not break stealth? thats so weird
[1:20:49] <callsigneagle01> @6PoundsofShrimp neither hopefully
[1:20:49] <%spiritofmojave> This just makes me want to reinstall Witcher again
[1:20:56] <+Ace5335> vineClown
[1:20:57] <%mastertwin2> Somehow Aela is a stealth follower despite wearing heavy armor
[1:20:58] <+tigerfang86> Skyrimming around
[1:21:00] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> not being able to marry serena
[1:21:07] <+Estuko> LUL I love how pat has to be super cautious because anyone could just fuck up his day
[1:21:07] <%terribleusername> shoot first, ask later
[1:21:08] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Nobody in this game is cool Pat, it's Skyrim.
[1:21:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Kill them all.
[1:21:15] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @callsigneagle01 but we gotta kill the stormclock scum for being racists
[1:21:16] <Tennochief> except for Kodlack
[1:21:18] <skeletonknifefight> i love that serana shuts you down super hard
[1:21:19] <%Niney_Who> HE SCREAM
[1:21:20] <Tennochief> Kodlack is cool
[1:21:21] <$Tuskor13> Paige only loves Cicero because he's short ginger and insane like Pat
[1:21:22] <%Mornaka> You should Skyrim those merchants Pat

[1:22:04] <Sedrelic> its cute...but i always feel sorry for him
[1:22:05] <callsigneagle01> it's literally not

[1:22:39] <rytisone> yeah, I guess
[1:22:39] <+6PoundsofShrimp> @AngriestPat only if you kill the stormclock scum

[1:22:41] <Cymen90> @AngriestPat How come Woolie never played any of these games?

[1:22:44] <%terribleusername> the most dangerous of enemy, the rat
[1:22:45] <dekkitout> Usually, I'd side with religious oppression, but inn Skyrim's context it's TOTALLY REAL! SeriousSloth
[1:22:45] <%thackattack00> ResidentSleeper
[1:22:46] <indig0bird> I kinda miss it but I hate it
[1:22:46] <%Ninestempest> here's a hint chat, it doesn't matter cause the thalmor are willing to wait hundreds of years before making a move
[1:22:46] <BallinArbiter> Yeh
[1:22:47] <$cdrom321> Can't wait for Skyrim 2.

[1:22:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Die, monster, you don't belong in this world!
[1:22:52] <callsigneagle01> The interesting thing is the Stormcloaks are more extreme xeno focus than racist but the meme have coalesced into such
[1:22:54] <shotgang86> I applied the Open Cities mod and man does it make a difference, thanks for the suggestion Pat
[1:22:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Penakoto) (warning)

[1:23:15] <shotgang86> meeew
[1:23:16] <callsigneagle01> But the real thing is that the writers had to make them hate everyone because if they didn't everyone would side with them for Independence.

[1:24:02] <MonstarGrrrl> is that paige ?
[1:24:03] <Zalthia> If Bethesda actually goes with the "Thalmor are trying to destroy the world to ascend into godhood" plot line I will be very suprised

[1:24:15] <SumKnowBuddy> awwww poopy babyyyy
[1:24:16] <joedatuous> the big screm
[1:24:16] <+TeraMercier> The Stormcloaks view Skyrim to be Nord territory, and therefore view anyone of any other race to be potentially untrustworthy. It's not racist in script, but in application
[1:24:17] <Mr_Strut> NONSTOP INFINITE LOADING
[1:24:17] <hntronium> That was big skrem

[1:24:20] <+absolute_cagemony> hmmmmm
[1:24:20] <callsigneagle01> Like the only real reason the Storms hate everyone else is because the writers needed a hardcore reason for the people to dislike them at all.
[1:24:20] <invisi_bliss> somebody's gettin fuuuucked
[1:24:21] <starotter70> YE YE YE

[1:24:35] <%Binary_Fireball> @pat would you tap that?
[1:24:37] <skeletonknifefight> i mean...thats generally how writing works
[1:24:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Estuko Why did you share! Now we both suffer!
[1:24:41] <%Binary_Fireball> damn it
[1:24:42] <callsigneagle01> especially when the Thalmor are constantly over their shoulder
[1:24:43] <+Thunder_Poo> wouldn't it be easier to swim downstream?
[1:24:43] <Sloavon> divinity 2 is on sale on ps4. should I get it chat?

[1:24:50] <+MrWrann> Game still runs, not enough mods
[1:24:51] <+Estuko> @doc_ock_rokc FeelsBadMan don't ground me please
[1:24:52] <CrimsonFox777> It's Skyrim, you can never overdo it with mods.
[1:24:53] <+neuwaive> change the ingame difficulty?
[1:24:53] <majindusto> To Much Mods
[1:24:55] <haisho> no that's modded combat in a nutshell really
[1:24:56] <%CaptainTubaki> GASP
[1:24:56] <detectivedeera> but the game looks beautiful
[1:24:56] <ThalosTheSoviet> @Sloavon yes
[1:24:59] <rytisone> shoulda installed some tiddies
[1:25:00] <%Bluwizard21> loudest footsteps ever
[1:25:01] <sponsoredviewer910> divinity 2 is great, get it
[1:25:03] <%Niney_Who> NO
[1:25:03] <flubber3d> just a bit
[1:25:03] <Calamity2007> @AngriestPat Any chance you can share your load order
[1:25:03] <majindusto> "Too"
[1:25:06] <Rashnam> think you need more mods
[1:25:09] <+TeraMercier> To be fair though, the Empire is just tryin to keep an unruly faction from being shit-disturbers after they LOST a WAR over it
[1:25:10] <shotgang86> its fine Pat
[1:25:11] <%spacedroner1> Didn't this exact thing happen with New Vegas
[1:25:11] <%Strider222> fog looks really nice
[1:25:13] <suikudo> You need to game it more
[1:25:13] <alexandrecau> pat you can't think
[1:25:14] <%StarDiamond1> we need more mods
[1:25:14] <%Instagig> more mods to fix the mods
[1:25:15] <%sshen> hit 500mods
[1:25:15] <%spiritofmojave> Hey, you tried Pat c:
[1:25:17] <dekkitout> Smaller amount of mods? Heresy!
[1:25:17] <+C24U> Pat needs Mods badly
[1:25:18] <%Luna_Ashford> @AngriestPat Wildcat + Ultimate Combat is fucking crazy Pat, just pick one or the other
[1:25:19] <SubjectX07x> The mods are fine, you just need to not play this like vanilla.
[1:25:19] <%Dr00_PhD> more tiddy less difficulty
[1:25:19] <MissJenniecide> that fog is real nice
[1:25:19] <Mr_Strut> Pat, since when do you have good ideas?
[1:25:20] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@6PoundsofShrimp) (warning)
[1:25:21] <xeros720> MROW
[1:25:21] <%Order_of_Mystery> @sloavon yes. dos2 is great, and you won't regret it!
[1:25:21] <Tennochief> Some mods are good on paper, but in game they suck
[1:25:23] <Huntercd> Lady Elmo @AngriestPat
[1:25:24] <%AncelDeLambert> it'd be a better idea to just do the main quest and level up your equipment
[1:25:25] <Tucker0603> I'm greatly enjoying this
[1:25:25] <%ItsRatman> You should only have one combat overhaul mod on, theres no way they're all balanced with each other
[1:25:25] <ThalosTheSoviet> 500GB of compressed mods
[1:25:26] <suikudo> Common pat you beat darksouls!
[1:25:28] <%deviljhojho94> unlimited mod works
[1:25:29] <drfights> no, MORE mods
[1:25:29] <%gsun103> no, we need more mods
[1:25:30] <%korth367> double down on the mods i say
[1:25:30] <SpaceCatStation> no don't take mods out. you gotta make it MORE skyrim
[1:25:31] <Zalthia> @callsigneagle01 Especially because it was the Empire that tried to kill you. That puts the Stormcloaks above them in any player's eyes
[1:25:31] <PineappleBison> 1000 mods
[1:25:32] <+tigerfang86> not hard ENOUGH
[1:25:32] <$RaikenTB> Your embarrassment is my entertainment.
[1:25:33] <theguy4445> pat just wanted to give us a fun time ):
[1:25:34] <%deviljhojho94> we believe it
[1:25:35] <NoMojoJoJo> baby scream for more mods
[1:25:36] <starotter70> Double Down
[1:25:37] <%TheYellowcouch> You know what will fix your problem Pat? More mods.
[1:25:38] <haisho> modded combat is just really, really brutal, no matter what it is
[1:25:38] <+Thunder_Poo> but in the end it doesn't even matter
[1:25:38] <callsigneagle01> @TeraMercier Empire did that by basically letting the Thalmor in after they lost the war
[1:25:39] <+TeraMercier> Agreed, two combat mods is overkill
[1:25:42] <+6PoundsofShrimp> share the load mr frodo
[1:25:45] <+techhunter80> so pat do you feel at home playing this since you're a drawf
[1:25:45] <callsigneagle01> Like
[1:25:46] <%lizard0tm> why have less mods? if the game isn't actively crashing every 20 mins, there room for more mods
[1:25:46] <%Ninestempest> Pat has 10 more mods than me, i'm super upset
[1:25:46] <%deviljhojho94> So as I pray, unlimited mod works
[1:25:47] <sponsoredviewer910> if you can tell it's skyrim then you don't have enough mods
[1:25:51] <+KennyK> What problems are we talking about?
[1:25:55] <TootPirate> D:
[1:25:55] <+BigBruthaThunda> 1000mods yes
[1:25:58] <%spiritofmojave> Christ
[1:26:02] <starotter70> Hey, that is pretty looking
[1:26:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KennyK The Fog
[1:26:04] <based_lobster> Would you like a So-da?
[1:26:09] <Zalthia> Also the Empire has Ivanova and that makes them cool
[1:26:09] <bruses1> don't worry pat, magic can even wreck you in vanilla skyrim if you are unprepared
[1:26:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat needs Fuus so bad
[1:26:16] <%Bluwizard21> why's he going that way when he said he was going for silent moon?
[1:26:17] <NoMojoJoJo> @Ninestempest then get 11 more
[1:26:19] <Mr_Strut> Uh oh. Paige is dying again
[1:26:20] <+KennyK> What fog @doc_ock_rokc
[1:26:21] <callsigneagle01> You can't do the 'we're best staying with Skyrim! Only then can we resist the Thamlor!" when there's a Thalmor ambassador like ten feet from them
[1:26:28] <detectivedeera> rude
[1:26:29] <haisho> time to save
[1:26:29] <starotter70> Well
[1:26:29] <+cafefunk> So how is the game running with that many mods?
[1:26:29] <+TeraMercier> @callsigneagle01 If the bottom line is that the current situation means that the elves can definitely beat them, then maybe implement the laws they want and don't bother to enforce them
[1:26:30] <majindusto> You tried so hard...and got so far...But in the End, it didn't even matter
[1:26:32] <Tennochief> ow
[1:26:33] <Zeddsworth> You should install Blended Roads, makes roads actually 3 dimensional instead of flat
[1:26:33] <%CaptainTubaki> apatJpeg
[1:26:33] <+6PoundsofShrimp> not even gonna take the arrow
[1:26:33] <%Ninestempest> I'm good actually
[1:26:34] <alrobot2014> @Bluwizard21 bad sense of direction
[1:26:34] <InugamiTheHound> boom headshot!-FPS doug
[1:26:35] <Admiral_Apathy> why does the grass look like astroturf
[1:26:35] <%gsun103> ok then
[1:26:42] <dekkitout> That Bust got borked- wait a sec
[1:26:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> You're not really playing modded skyrim if you don't have the cheese shout.
[1:26:44] <%Binary_Fireball> door just sploideed
[1:26:50] <+techhunter80> all the textures look weird without grass or snow
[1:26:55] <+AlexGrahamBell> i havent played non vanilla skyrim
[1:26:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Reshader
[1:26:55] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat is this OG skyrim or special edition?
[1:26:56] <%lizard0tm> no, no turn down
[1:26:57] <%DigitalJoshie> man slow mo kills in this game are jank
[1:26:58] <callsigneagle01> @TeraMercier But they didn't 'definitely' beat them, the Thalmor army got fucked in the last big battle of the war
[1:26:59] <haisho> really? seems fine to me
[1:27:02] <+TeraMercier> Pass on this grass mod, it's really out of place
[1:27:04] <+Dragoneye77> Wow I cant believe Pat bought his game again vargTodd
[1:27:06] <shotgang86> Pat, WE ARE HERE FOR THE GOOFY

[1:29:52] <%gsun103> bandits OP
[1:29:55] <haisho> you're trying to sneak early game in Skyrim with a combat mod in broad daylight. You're going to get detected real hard
[1:29:55] <+AlexGrahamBell> I feel like we've been here Patrick
[1:29:57] <+neuwaive> Most combat mods are made to make stealth archer less viable
[1:29:59] <+AlexGrahamBell> this is the part where you die
[1:30:00] <dekkitout> Kite em into guards, you know the drill
[1:30:00] <+TeraMercier> That's why increased spawns are really iffy for hardcore combat mods
