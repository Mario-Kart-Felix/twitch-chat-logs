[0:13:02] <Soul_Intern> @AirlineFood74 THAT'S GREAT LUL
[0:13:02] <Parapattern> How about when he shot Punisher into the stratosphere?
[0:13:03] <+Toblo1> I think my liking of Shocker depends on his design for that continuity
[0:13:03] <+Lethal_Poi5on> Homecoming shocker DansGame
[0:13:03] <god__of__lore> Read Superior Foes is Spider Man for the Shocker-Mobile
[0:13:05] <%aishman> The Shocker is in Homecoming dude.

[0:13:07] <%Cynful_Pleasures> He was in the spider man game matt LPed solo
[0:13:07] <theangryguyofde> Does Spiderman also teleport?
[0:13:07] <+donpatrondx> "DONT MOCK THE SHOCKER" is an actual quote
[0:13:07] <InsomniacPersona> Rumor is Mysterio is the villain in the next Spidey movie
[0:13:09] <Cosairen> he killed mary jane that one time
[0:13:10] <+levitheshark> @AngriestPat The entire second half of Spider-Man 2 is against Mysterio
[0:13:10] <+redanimator> swarm is still the worst he has bee powers
[0:13:10] <%TDotGoat> so mysterios
[0:13:11] <+Twinmin> isnt he the new villain in the next movie?
[0:13:11] <bum_boi> Nah venom is way better Pat, sorry
[0:13:11] <%Cynful_Pleasures> for one shitty boss fight
[0:13:12] <dmysta3000> He might be in Far From Home according to rumors
[0:13:12] <%storytayl0r> I'm still hoping for Csrnsge to show up.
[0:13:13] <%wizkid50000> Shocker is in homecoming
[0:13:13] <Firesparks> punisher was a spiderman villian

[0:13:15] <+Bt_Robot> Remember that time Aunt May was a multi-dimensional god being who also had the hots for her adoptive son Peter?
[0:13:15] <Shinmaddrox> He is kind of the entire problem for like 1 or two of the Spiderman games.
[0:13:16] <Mr_Strut> He has entire levels
[0:13:16] <%flying_hipp0> was the main villian in shattered dimensions
[0:13:16] <%heyitsbrian> Mysterio killed the X-Men! Mysterio is rad!
[0:13:16] <%PunishedRaccoon> @AngriestPat he was in shattered dimensions
[0:13:16] <alexandrecau> the animated series too for some reason he wasn't used much
[0:13:17] <$Mornaka> Spider-Man has similarly terrible villains such as Paste-pot Pete cheer200
[0:13:18] <Kokoro_Breaker> hes the main baddie in shatterd demsions
[0:13:19] <LuckyLagomorph> JJJ is the best villain
[0:13:19] <alexth3gr3at> What about the Spiderman PS1 Mysterio battle?
[0:13:22] <DonatelloJose> Gotta have him in the NEXT GAME
[0:13:22] <%ssjklyco> I hope the portal guy is in this game.

[0:23:55] <AncelDeLambert> Venom would be on the goddamn cover
[0:23:56] <Soul_Intern> it's true
[0:23:56] <federico_with_a_f> D L C
[0:23:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat SHOCKER AND JACKAL
[0:23:56] <Prism_Wing> I'm so over Venom now.
[0:23:58] <$Mornaka> they are
[0:23:58] <+bread_assassin> And then after that, Mysterio
[0:23:59] <Soul_Intern> THEY ARE
[0:24:00] <C_S_N_G> They are
[0:24:02] <%happyface699> KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS LOW BOI
[0:24:02] <Sacksquatch> They are
[0:24:03] <+ViewtifulYoshi> Saving Venom for the inevitable sequel.
[0:24:03] <iwa5h4ck3d> Kingpin is pretty broken
[0:24:03] <cerberuscarmine> true
[0:24:03] <%gingergaming8> they are stupid
[0:24:04] <zal_silverfang> cause they act as jobers
[0:24:04] <%patriotrenegade> They are
[0:24:04] <deviljhojho94> they are
[0:24:05] <turf_wind_and_fire> They are!
[0:24:08] <lightsout177> theyre idioys thats why
[0:24:08] <+redanimator> black clover next week hopefully better then new boruto game
[0:24:08] <Covil91> Is the webs biological or mechanical in this game?
[0:24:09] <admiral_of_crunch> Aww, Carnage would be great. Remember when he showed up at the end of 64 and it was horrifying? That a trip.
[0:24:11] <$SGrim> They're both functionally disabled.
[0:24:11] <sosuke5> They are like logia's from One Piece
[0:24:13] <+Soul_Bruce_Lee> Hydroman isn't even canon
[0:24:15] <%Agami23> hydroman and sandman are legit one piece power tier villains
[0:24:15] <mercado94> what if venom is like a super secret boss ala kingdom hearts 2
[0:24:15] <+lasersxpanther> sandman one shoved himself down spiderman's throat and blew him up
[0:24:17] <+xxviios> yeah sandman is s tier
[0:24:17] <CatmanIX> they're literally stupid ConcernDoge
[0:24:17] <xeros720> every sandman i've seen might actually never been to high school
[0:24:18] <%DedlokPM> Sandman was a good before he was sandified
[0:24:21] <Huntercd> Yea it's weird
[0:24:22] <OkamiDude15> remember that time sandman straight up killed spiderman but going inside of him and just exploding him from the inside out?
[0:24:23] <Chancestohr> When a character has a power that is too powerful the writers are forced to either sideline them or make them jobbers.
[0:24:24] <AnimeJedi25> Rocket man has a family at home
[0:24:24] <AncelDeLambert> Once again, Pat is 100% right
[0:24:24] <kwangalang> sandman is an immortal GOD
[0:24:25] <+Bt_Robot> Remember when Leopardon was in The Amazing Spiderman #112?
[0:24:26] <+michingmallecho> Hydro man. Just get him in the sun anneKappa anneKappa
[0:24:27] <%shin_garbage> @AngriestPat Regular
[0:24:27] <roboguy2k> Pat Dragon Quest XI came out 3 days ago you bought the wrong game
[0:24:27] <Neo_Kaiser> Venom's reached a point where people think he's the focus of Spider-Man.
[0:24:29] <devanmuse> remember that time Doc Ock took over peter parker's body for about a year and none of his friends or family noticed?
[0:24:30] <%DedlokPM> Not sure about Hydroman
[0:24:30] <%SirFailsAlott> apatDab the only reason for subbing
[0:24:32] <$GohanEgret> k e r m i t
[0:24:34] <lloyddboy> you think sandman can beat anakin?
[0:24:34] <$floridianman> KERMIT
[0:24:34] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Reminder that Electro is one of the most broken characters in Marvel but he's too stupid to use his powers to his full potential
[0:24:36] <TofuTama> @superorangerobin Svenom is my favorite Spoderman villain dude

[0:44:44] <quinnage7> Are they using AN-94's?
[0:44:47] <$Chimeraelite> unless they're reinforced
[0:44:49] <Volkrotia> Burn the Imperial system. Science will advance faster
[0:44:49] <jetpack_rorschasch> The spider man swings good: 10/10 Pat Certified!
[0:44:50] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> OH FUCK BIG RIG
[0:44:51] <%flagi64> "Am I a shill? Maybe"
[0:44:51] <alcors_wisdom> WHY DOES THAT COP HAVE A DEAG

[0:45:02] <+Jonesman64> wowzer.. better than spidey 2? impressive
[0:45:03] <ragasquid> they look like type 95's
[0:45:05] <the_sprankton> who volunteered to drive that truck?
[0:45:07] <HayabusaTaichou> My favourite sort of heroes are the ones that do it as a job That double life almost get fired cause you're heroing when you should be working shit is super irritating.
[0:45:14] <alexandrecau> wouldn'T at least one cop check the rear for shit like that
[0:45:16] <+DERGONS86> shock
[0:45:17] <renegadekira> AIR JUGGLE WITH YOUR WEBS PAT!!!
[0:45:18] <+Grayhammatter> HEY! it's SPIDERman
[0:45:20] <DukeMoose> Police didnt come with patrol rifles for HVT Arrest, IMMERSION RUINED
[0:45:20] <AncelDeLambert> THAT'S his banter?
[0:45:21] <$ooblagis> Why would a criminal ever think a massive attack on police is the best way to commit a crime?
[0:45:23] <Volkrotia> Yea thats a Arkham
[0:45:28] <Firesparks> spiderman is batman?
[0:45:29] <HypeArbalest> Look Im American and I say the foot pound system SUCKS!
[0:45:30] <$SGrim> ARKHAM rooPog
[0:45:31] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> already hit
[0:45:31] <BlackV0rt3x> A big explosion, and all the cops still have their hats on. Neat
[0:45:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> so its Mordor
[0:45:33] <@WoolyFish> Look at the puddles though 0/10
[0:45:33] <californaya> It's an Arkham
[0:45:37] <Meta_Four> @Ell1ot Because if cops were smarter in these stories, there'd be less for the main characters to do.
[0:45:37] <AtlasMcCoy> Yep thats an arkham
[0:45:37] <Intolerable> I'm hoping for a "I'M GOING TO DIE" MOMENT
[0:45:40] <AthenaAegis> Spider Man: Arkham City Kappa
[0:45:40] <Man_F_Artwish> Tankers do blow up like that it's awesome
[0:45:43] <%heyitsbrian> It's Spidey-Arkham
[0:45:49] <$ooblagis> That's a Bamham
[0:45:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> looks a lot closer to Mordor to me
[0:45:50] <cerberuscarmine> its like 2 then
[0:45:51] <Buttsong> sparkham
[0:45:54] <+ATentacleMonster> I love their ragdoll
[0:45:55] <Volkrotia> I hope future abilities make it less Arkham
[0:45:55] <EMP_Ike_Turner> RAGE
[0:45:59] <Pairoschuz> whoa, childish gambino is here to kill you
[0:45:59] <%brave_sj> How is the fucking National Guard not there immediately for the large group of men with automatic rifles shooting up Time Square

[0:46:00] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> Spider-Man: The Last City Kappa
[0:46:00] <sosuke5> So is this twink boi spider-man, or big dicked spider-man?

[0:46:06] <californaya> YEAH LAUNCHERS
[0:46:06] <AncelDeLambert> who ARE these people, and where's the army at this point?

[0:46:08] <Giothegame> How's it feel Pat?
[0:46:08] <%bloodypurpledog> that bitch dead
[0:46:08] <+Ciphris> that guys dead
[0:46:09] <+joylent_blue> shadow of spidor
[0:46:09] <%pilgrimsayswhat> AIR COMBOOOOOOOOOOOS
[0:46:11] <$GohanEgret> more combo than marvel infinite Kappa
[0:46:12] <+SoarFlyer> THAT GUY IS DEAD NOW
[0:46:12] <%sayaman012341> JOOGLES
[0:46:13] <radical_skeleton> AIR COMBOS THIS IS BETTER THAN ARKHAM
[0:46:13] <%Order_of_Mystery> does spiderman have a helmsplitter?
[0:46:15] <$Mendin> When's Maximum Spider?
[0:46:15] <%pilgrimsayswhat> FUCKIN AIIIIIR COMBOOOOOS
[0:46:16] <SilverInferno3> MORE LAUNCHERS
[0:46:17] <Midknightsun316> This...

[0:46:18] <cherubsanonymous> How does combat feel?
[0:46:19] <333agus333> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:46:19] <alcors_wisdom> they very clearly modeled deags but only recorded sound from like a .38 special
[0:46:20] <+graffitisamurai> AIR JUGGLES
[0:46:21] <CriticKitten> Oh man this looks so good. ._.
[0:46:22] <renegadekira> AIR JUGGLE WITH WEBS DAMMIT
[0:46:23] <radical_skeleton> PAT CAN YOU AIR SNATCH
[0:46:25] <President_valentine> CRAWLER ASSAULT
[0:46:27] <californaya> Big Willie Style
[0:46:29] <alexandrecau> How many goons before you can just take the city saint row style
[0:46:29] <$Chimeraelite> OW
[0:46:29] <+graffitisamurai> IS THIS CHARACTER ACTION
[0:46:29] <+DonnyJaBronie> this is a good start
[0:46:30] <bearwagon> advantage of having super strength and flexibility in a superhero game is air combos
[0:46:32] <%happyface699> @bloodypurpledog No he stun with batmobille
[0:46:33] <Pairoschuz> Can't wait to see Willie's Willy
[0:46:34] <Fruitywhompus> SICK
[0:46:34] <Midknightsun316> Is fricking fantastic so far
[0:46:35] <%SuperCasualBoom> Spider-Man for Tekken 7 confirmed
[0:46:36] <+Ssaik> GOTTA LET IT OUT GOTTA LET IT OUT
[0:46:37] <DantesAnimus> UHM. Is that a Devil Bringer?????
[0:46:38] <+SoarFlyer> Use air raid!
[0:46:43] <Vikingincognito> Honestly the arkham combat always seemed like a better fit for spidey. The spider sense for counters, the wooshing acrobatic moves, the quick use of projectiles (webs)
[0:46:43] <$Chimeraelite> oof
[0:46:44] <+DonnyJaBronie> this is a GOOD start
[0:46:45] <+zetaplus> the reason I'll get this later is that I dont really like arkham combat
[0:46:46] <%Cinder5by5> This looks fucking great
[0:46:47] <%craig_t> fuck this looks good
[0:46:48] <+LogothX> I wonder if you can beat this game mashing all 4 buttons with one hand
[0:46:49] <BlackV0rt3x> Cool, SpiderMan has his own Codex and Otocon lady
[0:46:51] <californaya> >Re-Elect Osborn
[0:46:51] <AncelDeLambert> Spidey can lift a car, why would he need more than one punch to lay these guys out?
[0:46:51] <%craig_t> i need me a ps4
[0:46:51] <Ell1ot> look at all these people that Spiderman just killed
[0:46:53] <californaya> uh oh
[0:46:53] <Volkrotia> So it seems he starts with a pretty diverse kit right away. Already have air comboes and web tethers and shit
[0:46:53] <damienlunas> Is this a character action
[0:46:53] <$magikestral> man, it even does the POOF that arkham does, that's good
[0:46:55] <wsintai> Yuri, quit yelling at Yuri
[0:46:55] <CastellanVon> Batman but with air combos
[0:46:56] <admiral_of_crunch> I was pretty done with Arkham combat by the end of City, but this looks nice.
[0:46:57] <AirlineFood74> Yuri please stop saying Yuri
[0:46:57] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> Can you do the Web-Dom in this game PogChamp
[0:46:57] <+joylent_blue> but does it have air hike Kappa
[0:47:00] <+Quarkee> god i want a ps4
[0:47:03] <+MrMcCrabby> Pat, you gotta shoot them after you launch them
[0:47:06] <A_d3adly_zambo> max is having a hard time lol
[0:47:08] <Vorsun> Wow, it's so much better than Arkham because it doesn't have 5 years of slo-mo after each fight.
[0:47:08] <+CharredChord> and it actually makes sense because he uses webs
[0:47:09] <Parapattern> Like, guys, he could literally split you in half with his bare hands. Why would you even try to fight?
[0:47:11] <+BoboDaHobo> how much of that is just bashing square over and over again though?
[0:47:15] <%ECRead> oh i want that big stupid web cocoon bomb from Spidey 2
[0:47:20] <@WoolyFish> "Fisk Tower" subtle.
[0:47:22] <$SGrim> Spiderman, Spiderman beating up minorities, and outpacing the authorities. Spiderman! rooPog
[0:47:27] <$ooblagis> Interesting fact, Devil May Cry invented launching enemies
[0:47:28] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> Fish Tower
[0:47:28] <$magikestral> @bobodahobo from what i heard they force you to mix it ip
[0:47:31] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> this shit looks fucking great TPFufun

[0:48:01] <@PlagueOfGripes> why'd you destroy that property, spiderman
[0:48:01] <AtlasMcCoy> I guess a problem would be the spidey senses are colored white, which might be hard to see.
[0:48:03] <+Grayhammatter> He's SUPER dead
[0:48:03] <cherubsanonymous> I mean it's a AAA title so it makes sense

[0:50:09] <$TheNeedlesD> Spider-Matt
[0:50:09] <ravencloak13> @kommandantraphael Being called in?
[0:50:10] <%Keyd00d> spidermatt?
[0:50:11] <EMP_Ike_Turner> GIT GUD
[0:50:13] <miguelrod777> why do they only have pistols
[0:50:14] <InsomniacPersona> He does
[0:50:15] <+ButterShutter> @AncelDeLambert looks like spiderman and deadpool really were the same character OpieOP
[0:50:16] <tmix1600> But Carnage for 3 or 2
[0:50:19] <+DERGONS86> When does Elsa show up in this game?
[0:50:20] <+Grayhammatter> spidermatt pulls his punches
[0:50:20] <+Sinetha> Truth
[0:50:21] <spacecatstreams> is that canon
[0:50:24] <+RushUnplugged> canon, spidey pulls his punches 99% of the time, he can lift trains ffs
[0:50:24] <admiral_of_crunch> I'm waiting for thugs to start screaming about "The Bat".
[0:50:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah, imagine punching a hamster
[0:50:25] <+PatEarthGod> He pulls them REAL hard
[0:50:26] <+SoarFlyer> Like Captain America
[0:50:26] <Fruitywhompus> peter is a good boy
[0:50:27] <+ATentacleMonster> Srs Spiderman is fucked up
[0:50:27] <Man_F_Artwish> Does it feel better than the ps1 game
[0:50:28] <alexandrecau> @Parapattern he does actually doc ock died from repeated punch
[0:50:29] <silvcrest> One time he didn't he caved a villains skull in
[0:50:29] <eco419> Counter
[0:50:31] <Jolly_Adventurer> This combat looks really satisfying
[0:50:31] <FairOnFire> I think punching someone so hard they fly into the air like 10 feet is not pulling your punches
[0:50:32] <Parapattern> But he literally punches guys up into the air?
[0:50:33] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> like a hero
[0:50:33] <%ssjklyco> Insomniac knows how to make a solid game
[0:50:34] <+JonThePrettyOKGuy> With all these "he's not dead" shenanigans, he's just the Kiryu of Marvel
[0:50:38] <$MonsterEnvy> r2 to wall ruj
[0:50:39] <Ell1ot> he just swung a cinderblock at someone
[0:50:39] <arcaderabbit48> His spider sense also lets him feel how hard he's hitting them, so he knows how hard to hit them without popping their heads off
[0:50:40] <turf_wind_and_fire> Pat you got a wall run on R2
[0:50:41] <Niney_Who> look at this Dead space shit
[0:50:42] <Risingxiv> whaaaat? does Superman pull his punches too???
[0:50:42] <+khalcipher> EWWWW
[0:50:43] <+KennyK> Oh is that also what happened in Punisher Warzone?
[0:50:44] <%Order_of_Mystery> I want to see spider-man punch someone at full force so badly.
[0:50:45] <ragasquid> that's fucking radical
[0:50:46] <ravencloak13> Spidey could dead lift trains with a finger
[0:50:47] <AirlineFood74> @FairOnFire it is when full power is outright murdering
[0:50:48] <President_valentine> dude can casually lift cars
[0:50:49] <FairOnFire> Your head would fly off
[0:50:49] <Chainshada> @spacecatstreams Yes, when Doc Ock stole his body, he broke Scorpions jaw and KOd him in 1 hit
[0:50:50] <+Bt_Robot> Also Spider-Man is not nearly as strong as someone like Captain America.
[0:50:50] <+Valison> I love when doc ock takes over his body and immediately decapitates somebody with punch
[0:50:50] <DantesAnimus> just realized this is Sai Nijima he's working with lmao
[0:50:51] <uncleholly> Didn't spiderman straight up kill a dude with a single punch once?
[0:50:51] <damienlunas> @AngriestPat did you miss the R2 to wall run tutorial prompt?
[0:50:52] <supersparta333> I mean, Ryu does it all the time
[0:50:53] <+khalcipher> He looks like s spider ew
[0:50:54] <alexandrecau> you can't pull dive kick from five stories
[0:50:54] <ravencloak13> His fucking pinkey
[0:50:54] <SophisticHades> spider man is really strong
[0:50:54] <Tracazoid> He can punch a person's jaw right off if he doesn't pull his punches.
[0:50:55] <Covil91> I feel like a shootout with the cops would be strong evidence of crime
[0:50:55] <On_Target> yeah, when doc ock takes over his body for awhile doesn't he kill someone y accident
[0:50:55] <AlasterAngelo> why isn't Aunt May hot
[0:50:56] <$Mendin> You need evidence and a warrant THE MAN HAS A LITERAL PRIVATE ARMY ATTACKING THE POLICE RIGHT NOW WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED
[0:50:57] <Jslicerx> @AngriestPat Remember the story about Dr.Doom gettting permanent bodily damage from fighting Spider-man over time?
[0:50:59] <AtlasMcCoy> Wait, do superhero movies exist in worlds with superheroes?
[0:50:59] <future_famous_person> wincest
[0:50:59] <deviljhojho94> LUL They have SUPERHERO MOVIES IN THIS UNIVERSE
[0:50:59] <HiddenPorpoise> Everyone he throws 20 feet in the air is dead
[0:51:00] <silvcrest> Doc took over Spidey and accidently caved in Rhinos skull
[0:51:01] <+SoarFlyer> Not a punch, just a quick lil grab
[0:51:01] <SeventyForce> When doc-oc went into peter's body he wondered why peter didn't just explode every one he fought.
[0:51:04] <Pairoschuz> D'awwww
[0:51:04] <333agus333> didn't spider doctor octopus murder the first guy he fought?
[0:51:05] <AthenaAegis> He wouldn't harm a fly Kappa
[0:51:08] <FaytLeingodz> holy
[0:51:08] <cherubsanonymous> Mr. Negative when
[0:51:08] <%Paralurx> When Otto was in his body that one time he accidentally ripped Scorpion's jaw off cuz he didn't know how much Peter held back
[0:51:09] <$GohanEgret> @AlasterAngelo she is Kappa
[0:51:09] <Volkrotia> You can lift someone with a swift punch if you have enough control
[0:51:10] <3viltiki> Stan Lee compared Spidey's strength potential to Thor and Hulk.
[0:51:10] <RedMaskBandit> He can pick up a locamotive
[0:51:10] <CappuccinoGuil> There's this one comic where Spidey says he could take on the ENTIRE X-MEN and probably kill half of them
[0:51:11] <bendatron> probably except for enemies that can take it like certain iterations of green goblin thanos etc
[0:51:12] <Niney_Who> THROW ONE OFF PogChamp
[0:51:13] <%kimo313> >Hires paramilitary organization to mass-murder police in his building yet can't be put in jail LUL

[0:51:18] <@WoolyFish> Do the NTR route with Aunt May or you'll get the bad end.

[0:53:47] <$ooblagis> @codussalpha In an alternate timeline were he kills one dude and becomes mildly edgy, everything falls apart and becomes dysotopian because he's "the moral center" of Earth's heroes
[0:53:48] <%AlfredoCavatelli> did spider man just shoryuken that guy
[0:53:48] <$Mendin> Fisk is very concerned about hypoallergenic workplaces, he makes his vents big enough to employ literal chimney sweep orphan waifs to make sure the ductwork and HVAC is clean

[1:07:57] <californaya> He's human. He's basically if One Punch Man were a fat criminal.

[1:21:40] <Volkrotia> THATS FUCKING NEW YORK MAN
[1:21:41] <AirlineFood74> OSBORN
[1:21:42] <SilverInferno3> I love how the music immediately starts up when you go swinging
[1:21:46] <$magikestral> pat completely blowing off his boss
[1:21:46] <Volkrotia> This is impressing me
[1:21:51] <+Jonesman64> are there collectibles?
[1:21:56] <On_Target> Spidey's run continues to look dumb
[1:22:02] <lloyddboy> DO AIR TRICK
[1:22:04] <supersparta333> @Jonesman64 Yes
[1:22:04] <yuribo26> BIRDS FOR SCALE PogChamp

[1:22:10] <cimturry> GO KICK THOES BIRDS
[1:22:10] <+Blargimazombie> So 8 years later and Aunt May still doesn't know?
[1:22:10] <+Quarkee> i like how the music mainly picks up when youte swinging then fades out when you land
[1:22:12] <+Jonesman64> I hope there are collectibles...
[1:22:12] <1medjoe1> the map looks massive
[1:22:12] <+doc_ock_rokc> I'm a little sad the optional old swing rumor wasn't true
[1:22:13] <Chainshada> There are backpacks and landmark photos
[1:22:13] <Vorsun> MYSTERIO'S BACKPACKS?
[1:22:13] <$codussalpha> so....just how strong is spider man? i mean, i know he has at least some level of super strength, but just what's his maximum? who's he comparable to?
[1:22:13] <%mostundesired> @On_Target Doesn't matter when you can do AIR TRICKS
[1:22:14] <wsintai> @magikestral That's how he got the job Kappa
[1:22:14] <+hobojo153> IIRC the puddles weren't actually downgraded, there's just less in that one scene.
[1:22:14] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> what even
[1:22:15] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> SPIDER PACK :D
[1:22:15] <the_sprankton> there are antennae or something
[1:22:15] <+SoarFlyer> Steal backpacks?

[1:22:27] <lozscat> How does the webswinging feel?
[1:22:29] <+jetrouverai> are there balloons tho?
[1:22:30] <devanmuse> yknow, I just realized that the city's sanitation workers probably lose their minds cleaning up all that webbing
[1:22:31] <DaringOcelot> Is the classic suit from the start dlc or something?
[1:22:32] <Volkrotia> Like a Warframe
[1:22:32] <alexandrecau> web abird
[1:22:37] <+lucaflow> @AngriestPat How good does the swinging feel? Best Spiderman swinging ever?
[1:22:38] <On_Target> but he looks like that when runs on the ground too!
[1:22:39] <+RushUnplugged> the puddle thing is just shitbabies throwing a fit about nothing
[1:22:40] <%Sirculbs> @angriestpat The outfit you have on is different from the one in the move videos. Maybe you have a preorder bonus or something?

[1:22:48] <lozscat> How does swinging feel
[1:22:50] <C_S_N_G> The webbing dissolves after a few hours
[1:22:52] <+SoarFlyer> O
[1:22:53] <%Cynful_Pleasures> This looks like it feels amazing

[1:22:56] <%mostundesired> Doc's been waiting for like thirty minutes god damn.
[1:22:59] <wsintai> @devanmuse In most spidey continuities his webs naturally degrade after like a day or so
[1:23:00] <yuribo26> O
[1:23:03] <SilverInferno3> @Sirculbs He'll get the default costume later
[1:23:04] <Jslicerx> @AngriestPat You can transition from one trick into another for more XP just change the L stick direction mid trick
[1:23:04] <+mechslayer71> @cynful_pleasures it does!
[1:23:05] <$codussalpha> @devanmuse in universe, he makes his web formula so that it dissolves after a short time
[1:23:07] <Chainshada> The suit he has now is normal, you unlock the white spider suit soon
[1:23:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Sirculbs that's a story unlock
[1:23:08] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat check your suits or whatever, I think you've got a pre-order suit on
[1:23:12] <talisign> Is there an outfit with the weird armpit webs?
[1:23:12] <$magikestral> but its not efficient, pat
[1:23:12] <DonatelloJose> This is more effective then any commercial. I want a PS4 Just for this.
[1:23:13] <+HatAmazing> if only Bruce Campbell was here to narrate
[1:23:15] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> do what?
[1:23:15] <ravencloak13> If it feels half as good as it looks then it‚Äôs the best still
[1:23:18] <AirlineFood74> nvm LUL

[2:37:14] <energywarning> spacechem this is not
[2:37:15] <+Story_Ark> @strayshep is his Persona Spiderman?
[2:37:15] <%PatNTheHat> He sounds like he's working on a sex bot
[2:37:16] <Fruitywhompus> getting a science degree must be dumb easy
[2:37:19] <$Mendin> YEAH WELL AT LEAST IT ISN'T A GO BOARD, RIGHT PAT?!
[2:37:20] <FourSwissRollsNothingMore> WHERE"S MY SINCENCE MILLION DOLLARS

[2:37:22] <reonome> pat you're creating doc ock
[2:37:22] <%Vanessa_Ui> I hope we get a Resident Evil 4 slide puzzle, we'd be here for hours. apatElmo
[2:37:24] <PlasmaDood> damn bioshock puzzles
[2:37:26] <$RaikenTB> they didn't much effort into these puzzles.
[2:37:26] <+rooked4> I liked it when there were puddles in this scene, and the water would fuck up the science machine
[2:37:26] <+ctommy0720> omg theyre using the pipe game from bioshock
[2:37:26] <ravencloak13> @sirculbs Since when did security cameras have voice recorders?

[2:37:37] <%HannibalBeerus> BIG NERD
[2:37:38] <@WoolyFish> This is why Spider-Man gets beaten up in school all the time.
[2:37:41] <+levitheshark> WAS THAT PART OF THE PS1 STARTUP SOUND?!
[2:37:41] <+SammyKiller> @Arek_1 Resolution is definitely nice, I loved how God of war would have multiple settings, monster hunter too.
[2:37:42] <kwangalang> why include such basic puzzles
[2:37:44] <%jiin6> early game puzzles pat
[2:37:50] <talisign> Pat is smarter than a child.
[2:37:51] <%GarbageNirvana> So it looks like there's 25 different suits in the game
[2:38:00] <ravencloak13> @woolyfish For improving peoples lives?
[2:38:04] <CatmanIX> yea yea, spiderman building doc ocks suit for him

[2:38:08] <+SammyKiller> @Arek_1 Even with a 4k tv, the 1080p/50-60fps mode was a lot better in my opinion
[2:38:08] <x24sonic> need to tighten up the graphics on level 3
[2:38:09] <+Grayhammatter> ouuuu
[2:38:09] <%Sirculbs> @ravencloak13 It's a science wing. I'd imagine there is audio surveillance as well
[2:38:09] <@JustinianKnight> Oh no, MATH
[2:38:11] <$ooblagis> OK, the grid gets bigger, good
[2:38:16] <@WoolyFish> @ravencloak13 For being a huge nerd.

[2:38:22] <$ooblagis> You need 5
[2:38:25] <%jiin6> smarter than a 2nd grader lets see if he beat a 3rd grader

[2:46:19] <+srkAres> i mean its more realistic that the nerd makes the gadgets and isnt the hero himself
[2:46:20] <StrawberryPantsu> Why does Peter Look like Game theory
[2:46:20] <+Grayhammatter> he's a good guy, but a dummy

[2:46:35] <%rdark_ksu> Oh but radioactive spider powers is more believable?

[3:11:45] <HoIlywood_SN> Spider-Man was once tricked by Wolverine into 'full force pulverizing a womans face which immediately and instantly' killed her because he crushed her skull
[3:11:46] <+gwanzan> the music was the best part of those movies except Kristan Dunst's tits
[3:11:47] <tdude0175> The question on my mind is are there limited tokens

[3:16:26] <Clu_Flynn> K stream over
[3:16:30] <HoIlywood_SN> whats fucked up is the guy who came up with the code for the Spider-Man 2 swinging mechanic apparentl'y patented and officially' owns that shit and refuses to let them use it on Spider-Man games, which is why after Web of Shadows the swinging took a huge fucking nosedive with Spider-Man games and everyone kept having to try rebuilding that mechanic
[3:16:32] <ShinobiPhoenix> bringing in Paige unlocks Spider-Gwne
[3:16:33] <Cosairen> @majindusto she already knows
[3:16:37] <CatmanIX> @majindusto she already knows, was in chat earlier

[3:17:40] <AirlineFood74> @lutefiiisk okay thank you. Being crazy would really put a damper on my life
[3:17:42] <TerraBranfordStrife> Did Paige win that mustard contest?
[3:17:43] <321Continue> @hoilywood_sn well he made it on his own time, when SM2 was being developed it was gonna have shitty swinging but he did overtime to code his own web swinging
[3:17:43] <+deacon1621> It's a song from P5 Clench
[3:17:43] <The_Sorrow_> @Clenchknox852 Persona 5 ost
[3:17:43] <Flyrant> @HoIlywood_SN yeah I think I heard he was going to make his own game with it. Not spider man of course. Don't think it ever went anywhere.

[3:19:34] <Endocrom> Shepshefter
[3:19:35] <%lutefiiisk> @arek Cog>Pop out player
[3:19:38] <nzrai> the sound distortion is probably because of low latency or something
[3:19:39] <AirlineFood74> @Arek_1 click the player's settings, there's a pop-up option in there
[3:19:40] <vampireinarm> WHENS Minecraft Story mode 2 you cowards
[3:19:47] <Cosairen> @Hilleltaco it might be i thought i was positive but now im not

[3:20:14] <AirlineFood74> @ShinobiPhoenix Paige can chug entire bottles of mustard
[3:20:17] <ShinobiPhoenix> that doesn't come up nearly as much as McDonalds
[3:20:19] <AirlineFood74> And it's sickening
[3:20:20] <vampireinarm> @ShinobiPhoenix its not a meme, its her everyday
[3:20:20] <CatmanIX> @alcors_wisdom dunno man, i get weird vision problems all the time, try not to worry about it, maybe see an eye doc if it happens often
[3:20:30] <TafferAA> 2slow
[3:20:34] <%lutefiiisk> There is a pissing minigame in Yakuza Kiwami 2. And the best part is that it exists IRL in Japan.

[3:21:19] <bambowl> i don't hear anything wrong
[3:21:22] <zaptar13> It sounds fine.
[3:21:29] <ravencloak13> Musics fine to me
[3:21:30] <Arek_1> @dedlokpm I don't have that option. I'm on an older tablet and can sometimes accidentaly pop out the stream.
[3:21:36] <770megaman> The transitions are going Faster
[3:21:36] <CatmanIX> @Cinder5by5 try increasing stream quality (if possible) or refreshing, sounds fine to me
[3:21:37] <AirlineFood74> it's like a siren's call
[3:21:40] <fazoburquina> its getting distorted on my end
[3:21:41] <aeonicvector> OK, i just saw one of the last suits in the game 100/100 best costume

[4:17:09] <Sinister_Aglet> how is spider-man holding back if he has trouble with a normal heavyweight?
[4:17:10] <maskeddudej> no they go to sleep, forever
[4:17:10] <Iwashi94> @RevaniteRyan they get attached to a surface with webs
[4:17:11] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat paige, before you go "wow he killed that man", when you knock em off rorofs you send rope after them. might break their neck, but hey
[4:17:17] <HoIlywood_SN> okay so lets just pretend that every one of those guys he throws off a roof IS caught by a webline, that just means theyre going to tense up about 40 feet from the roof and swing right into solid concrete at extreme speeds, theyre still dead
[4:17:23] <aeonicvector> nope, last second spider-chutes
[4:17:23] <%craig_t> by rope i mean web
[4:17:24] <zaptar13> @revaniteryan I think he shoots them with a web so they stick to the building

[4:28:16] <AirlineFood74> He's always been a weeb
[4:28:17] <%Rostichenburg> Gwen cheated on Spider-Man with green goblin what a hero
[4:28:18] <dekkitout> kisk is a weeb cause he constantly hires red ninjas
[4:28:18] <Jslicerx> It might be to keep him zen, he's got those anger problems
[4:28:18] <eyelessstrider> can we get a QTE where we spin the Rhino on his horn?
[4:28:20] <Bouldus> well dipicted as weebos anyway
[4:28:21] <%rdark_ksu> Its cause he learned martial arts and had more money than sense
[4:28:23] <Endocrom> I hope to see "Dream of a fisherman's wife"
[4:28:23] <%jiin6> King of the weebs
[4:28:23] <Enyoyable> It's illegal to be this much of a weeabo LUL
[4:28:26] <%nitronLVIII> He stole Japan
[4:28:30] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat because organized crime in europe wasn't as classy
[4:28:31] <alcors_wisdom> FISK ACTUALLY OWNS LIKE I THINK ITS KADOKAWA AT SOME POINT
[4:28:31] <+CrystalLakeWasJusASetback> Because it's expensive shit and Fisk is a collosal douchebag.
[4:28:31] <%Cynful_Pleasures> He fought Wolverine in Japan once
[4:28:31] <+TheDastardlyD> that means touch the art
[4:28:31] <+baseball7000> @AngriestPat He was always a weeb. Knows how to sumo wrestle because he's a big fat guy.

[4:29:14] <cptbellybutton352> good boy elmo!
[4:29:15] <thehornypastrypuffer> "i want to be a real hero, not like pussy spider man"
[4:29:22] <dyepigeon> rose rosemann is a pretty okay name for an auctioneer
[4:29:24] <BeefyQueefer> MJ's walk cycle feels odd. Like it looks like they took Black Cat's and toned it down.
[4:29:24] <VectMachine> Fisk also has a laser cannon built into his canes.
[4:29:28] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> White MJs can't jump

[4:44:47] <HoIlywood_SN> the spider cum
[4:44:49] <%craig_t> the bit that always got me about gwen stacy is that spiderman had been doing shit for ages, he'd know how big fall+sudden stop affects unreinforced human neck

[4:55:45] <%Rostichenburg> Replacement cartridges on his belt or around the shooters
[4:55:45] <Sinister_Aglet> based considerate shocker
[4:55:48] <AirlineFood74> CONSCIOUS SHOCKER
[4:55:53] <dekkitout> man if spider man had the black-evil suit, shocker would UBER MURDER him
[4:55:56] <+justianxix> this rocket jumping motherfucker
[4:55:58] <+Krivvan> how do they hear each other over this?
[4:55:59] <mister_z_1994> GET BACK HERE SHOCKER
[4:56:06] <Kataguro> Rude
[4:56:11] <TranquilTurnip> That's a cool way to get around
[4:56:15] <bambowl> how can they hear each other
[4:56:15] <+Cigwynn> "You don't have emotions" says Sauske
[4:56:16] <majindusto> Aww, Shocker cares!
[4:56:27] <nzrai> B-BALA
[4:56:33] <TranquilTurnip> hes no more Z tier than Vulture
[4:56:33] <Ell1ot> how come Shocker doesn't go be a bad guy in a different state?
[4:56:33] <halospaz117> Shocker is so Z-Tier he loops around to A-Tier
[4:56:36] <%DedlokPM> SHOCKER! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME! I WILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH! z8z3
[4:56:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> shock? as in shockwave?
[4:56:37] <Endocrom> Stilt man is the Z-tierest
[4:56:39] <HoIlywood_SN> actuall'y Shocker traditionally is one of the Spider-Man villains whos fucked him up the most
[4:56:41] <ravencloak13> I always found it weird how Shocker and Electro are in the same world. Like, Shockers name always made me think he had some electric based power but it‚Äôs just concussive blast
[4:56:42] <OkamiDude15> Shocker? SHOCCKER!!!!! YOU CANT RUN FROM ME! ILL CHASE YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!! doodCrazy
[4:56:42] <viewtifulr> i miss shocker as fishnet man

[4:56:58] <extradopeness> Redundancy
[4:57:00] <AirlineFood74> BibleThump Shocker chan please
[4:57:00] <%craig_t> @AngriestPat are you actually familiar with shocker beyond the fox cartoon? he jumps between competent low tier and total joke, sometimes both at once
[4:57:01] <HoIlywood_SN> @ravencloak13 its shocker because he makes vibrational 'shockwaves
[4:57:01] <bear_breaker20> Kinda makes every spidy villian feel redundant after scorpion got his jaw punched off...
[4:57:02] <%SergeEXE> This is a lot more radical than I thought it would be
[4:57:08] <%DavidSanChan> shock juice is loose
[4:57:09] <s_snowball> how can they hear each other from 50m away and moving like that
[4:57:09] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Not nice Herman
[4:57:15] <AirlineFood74> EAT IT
[4:57:20] <Strigiform> shocker built prototypes of those gloves while in prison, hes a dumb iron man
[4:57:26] <eyelessstrider> how much do we need to donate for pat to actually yell that line?
[4:57:26] <%Rostichenburg> He‚Äôs better than Montana and the enforcers
