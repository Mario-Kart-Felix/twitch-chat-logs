[0:44:48] <%SergeEXE> video games
[0:44:49] <KRSG> Welp. Don't know what happened. Was Merging mods and now a shit ton of masterfile esm files are missing. Don't know what happened to them. Don't really give a shit. Fuck Vortex. Not taking the chance of wasting two weeks again. FUCKKKA!!
[0:44:49] <AirlineFood74> Missed book NotLikeThis
[0:44:50] <+Fallout48> @natebud he has them installed and mentioned Lonesome road would be "The end of the game" so I think he's doing them.
[0:44:51] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AirlineFood74 Which Pat isn't doing.
[0:44:53] <%jiin6> Star caps are not worth
[0:44:53] <zafooru> he is at 1 pip
[0:44:53] <Ghost_Excalibur> The Item menu is modded right??
[0:44:54] <TheEnablerr> 9 caps? OH BOI!
[0:44:56] <%LargePhallusRichard> i think theres a survial guide
[0:44:58] <%crimsonharvest> yay book
[0:45:00] <+Exyoh> Hey, pre-war money is totally worth for the long game
[0:45:02] <%sparrrow_> Is the Indiana Jones fridge in this game or in Fallout 3??
[0:45:03] <%OwlLightningMage> 9 caps PogChamp
[0:45:03] <zafooru> large blindness
[0:45:05] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Fix YOUR LEG you asss
[0:45:06] <+IronPickle> I thought Paige was the blind one
[0:45:08] <%LargePhallusRichard> noice
[0:45:12] <StubYourToe> how many times has Pat save scummed so far? anyone know?
[0:45:12] <zafooru> survival is such a garbage skill
[0:45:14] <%Too_Much_Nukie> I don't know if Pat even can target individual limbs with his dumb controller mod.
[0:45:14] <%rdark_ksu> books are power
[0:45:15] <KronusX7> Lol was just typing about the book
[0:45:18] <natebud> @sparrrow_ This one outside of goodsprings
[0:45:18] <Xel_Gel> did he summon the bottle cap man
[0:45:20] <%jiin6> he's going to regret not getting comprehension
[0:45:20] <Loxoron> @sparrrow_ this one
[0:45:20] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> why not sleep
[0:45:22] <+augurgewalt> you should grab mags anyway since they weigh nothing and are worth a bit. lockpikcing and hacking ones are regularly handy too
[0:45:22] <%Nobrev> @AngriestPat I just finished watching your DAI troubleshooting stream.
[0:45:23] <MihajloMBlood> @zafooru You clearly never played on hardcore
[0:45:24] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat because you lost your other 4 pairs of eyes
[0:45:25] <dekkitout> "Boot. Ant."
[0:45:26] <alrobot2014> paige is spreading her status effects
[0:45:26] <%TeraMercier> Being a good level and place for the dlc is still like two streams from here
[0:45:27] <StubYourToe> noice
[0:45:28] <FoxInABeret> @sparrrow_ It's this one, but Pat doesn't have WW, so it won't trigger.
[0:45:28] <%jiin6> Fix it better
[0:45:30] <yourliteraldog> Toster repair
[0:45:30] <Mangahero18> @Exyoh its in the game but you need wild wastland perk
[0:45:31] <ScreamingMeat> "It's FIIIIIIIIINE!"
[0:45:32] <blademaster247> Your leg's got the GOUT
[0:45:33] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I don't believe you Pat
[0:45:34] <%MagickBurritoh> stump foot
[0:45:35] <%AbnormalVoid> Pat saves cum
[0:45:35] <+InugamiTheHound> have you modded any of your weapons?
[0:45:35] <massive_laser_zapper> i think the indiana jones fridge is from the wild wasteland perk?
[0:45:37] <DracaenaLeaf> plot moving
[0:45:40] <%lizard0tm> you move much slower with crippled limbs
[0:45:42] <%crimsonharvest> oh yeah dont forget you can just sleep for an hour to hel
[0:45:42] <%jiin6> the BONES SHOWING PAT
[0:45:46] <%OwlLightningMage> How many times has Pat scummed saved? LUL
[0:45:47] <%lizard0tm> fix your fucking leg
[0:45:47] <zafooru> yeyeyeye
[0:45:47] <%payterodactyl> @AngriestPat I just watched a 2 hour video about how fallout 3 is better than new vegas, whats your opinion on that?
[0:45:49] <AMajorTom> There's no need to save scum when you min-max
[0:45:49] <Polengoldur> oo pats playing GUN
[0:45:52] <$Mornaka> rex is a good boy
[0:45:52] <+CuttleCrow> HEATHEN
[0:45:53] <yourliteraldog> Robo dog
[0:45:54] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Rex is melee only though.
[0:45:54] <%Fidel_Castbro> are you getting Boone too
[0:45:55] <+augurgewalt> "fine" he says
[0:45:55] <Ser_Randal> FUCK YOU PAT
[0:45:55] <Disname23> My legs are ok
[0:45:55] <LtSergei> scrub
[0:45:56] <cadlingtongaming> I like Rex as a dog, but I think ED-E is more useful in terms of his perk.
[0:45:56] <FutaSnek> Is thia modded?
[0:45:56] <tinypouf> nnnNNNOO
[0:45:56] <zafooru> doggo > orb
[0:45:56] <%lewdskeletor13> You did it with Malcolm too
[0:45:57] <%NWR_James> Bones exposed on stream. Peach is panting
[0:45:57] <%deviljhojho94> wat the fuck pat
[0:45:58] <%battlefield900> fix your right foot pat
[0:45:59] <KronusX7> ED-E is better tho
[0:45:59] <%marvinbrewton25> sleep for an hour pls!
[0:45:59] <+alphonseisbest> boooooo
[0:45:59] <VeryTricky> shepard.
[0:45:59] <Shisno27> boooooooooo
[0:46:00] <corepool> well rex is good boy
[0:46:00] <%OwlLightningMage> Rex ResidentSleeper
[0:46:01] <%TheSpiritof2277> Rex's perk is far better, and he's a good boy
[0:46:03] <LightningLynx89> Rex is the best
[0:46:04] <+alphonseisbest> boooooooooo
[0:46:04] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat favorite companion to have in the "human" slot?
[0:46:05] <dekkitout> por que no las dos
[0:46:05] <tinypouf> but robot friend ):
[0:46:06] <mayorrev> why does Fallout always have this ugly piss filter
[0:46:09] <rararasputino> Disappointing, but not surprised
[0:46:10] <+alphonseisbest> boooooooo
[0:46:10] <%jiin6> HAVE BOTH EDE and Rex
[0:46:10] <%Too_Much_Nukie> ED-E has battle music, and lasers, and a sweet chassis.
[0:46:11] <randomp141> @AngriestPat Not gonna get the "Robco Friendly Robots," mod?
[0:46:12] <Loxoron> Lily and rex best choices, fuck y'all don't @ me
[0:46:12] <MihajloMBlood> Rex blows
[0:46:13] <%battlefield900> your moving slower
[0:46:14] <ArtThouBored> Wrex?
[0:46:15] <KahtaLzargo> Fallout 2 is better for those that care about story
[0:46:17] <+TheRealVegerot> GL bringing rex into the divide Kappa
[0:46:18] <alrobot2014> Shepard
[0:46:18] <%abadbadman> Boone best boy
[0:46:18] <%Dungeon00X> Wow, this looks worse then I remember it.
[0:46:19] <+augurgewalt> bad take
[0:46:21] <%DavidSanChan> replace ed-e model with floating pat head
[0:46:22] <+CuttleCrow> Rex doesn't have BATTLE MUSIC
[0:46:23] <ArtThouBored> Wrex
[0:46:25] <%PauliusMaximus> you cant have E DE and rex
[0:46:27] <%deviljhojho94> shepard
[0:46:28] <KahtaLzargo> And new Vegas follows that
[0:46:28] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat who's gonna be your second companion?
[0:46:29] <zafooru> ants HATE getting shot
[0:46:30] <Forces45> Rex and Cass are the best but Boone is probably one of the better companions
[0:46:30] <KeystoneA1> Boone's is best -- the enemies literally glow
[0:46:31] <%Erictron4000> Have Rex and cass
[0:46:32] <machshop> @mayorrev the desert has a piss filter in real life
[0:46:33] <YourFalloutCompanion> THEM & THOSE
[0:46:34] <KronusX7> ED-E is better for energy weapons
[0:46:36] <Manooz> Boone is best companion get out
[0:46:36] <%OwlLightningMage> Except it never works
[0:46:37] <cadlingtongaming> ED-E basically gives you 20 Perception, though.
[0:46:37] <tinypouf> rex doesnt make cute beep sounds how dare you
[0:46:39] <dekkitout> not with that attitude, you cant!
[0:46:40] <%lewdskeletor13> Rex doesn’t have a heartbreaking backstory
[0:46:42] <%TeraMercier> Holy shit I forgot vanilla was so easy
[0:46:43] <Mangahero18> Why not do do both? Save scumming and MinMaxing are both part of the Fallout experience.
[0:46:44] <Redchimera45> "giant" worker ant
[0:46:44] <%sparrrow_> @mayorrev because it's a nuclear wasteland
[0:46:44] <thelonechris> Vaporized
[0:46:45] <Kamgin> EDF EDF EDF
[0:46:45] <kamen_advent> not gonna search the ants?
[0:46:46] <Ghost_Excalibur> What Mod is this?
[0:46:47] <%Jpdodds> how long has the game been running
[0:46:49] <%PauliusMaximus> Boone is pretty great
[0:46:53] <duebronge> EDE is better if you find his upgrades in Lonesome Road
[0:46:53] <%OwlLightningMage> I never found Rex's shit useful
[0:46:53] <zafooru> rex is only half toaster too
[0:46:55] <+augurgewalt> E-DE's ability is great too
[0:46:56] <$NocturneNovember> Rex also doesn't complain about his wife
[0:46:56] <%NumbusPlays> Rex doesn't do <sneaky beeping>
[0:46:56] <Disname23> Boone and Rex are the endgame team
[0:46:58] <VeryTricky> ED-F
[0:47:01] <Shisno27> THE EDF DEPLOYS
[0:47:01] <Disname23> Although Arcade is also acceptable
[0:47:01] <+alphonseisbest> @angriestpat HAVE U TRIED THE motorcycle MOD?
[0:47:04] <FoxInABeret> Rex and Boone are the Best Buddy Boys and you can't tell me otherwise.
[0:47:04] <cadlingtongaming> And that extends to your Companions, so ED-E and Boone basically kill the entire Mojave.
[0:47:04] <$codussalpha> @AngriestPat who's gonna fill the second companion slot?
[0:47:05] <Bek_359> ED-E has crafting stuff
[0:47:07] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat ED-E can get a crafting station, shits Energy Ammo, Has 10 Perception so you always get to notice enemies, and can get a better gun that crits as much as you
[0:47:07] <mayorrev> i dunno, i just wish it was more vivid like 4 personally
[0:47:08] <$Mornaka> Big Empty
[0:47:08] <cadlingtongaming> From a thousand miles away.
[0:47:08] <%crimsonharvest> not as big as GUN
[0:47:10] <%Dungeon00X> Bug brains everywhere

[0:47:19] <massive_laser_zapper> savescumming is kinda necessary in a game this prone to crashing

[0:48:53] <%TombstoneTTromboners> now you can pierce armor
[0:48:53] <cadlingtongaming> I like the Service Rifle. It's pretty good midrange.

[0:48:58] <$Niney_Who> How can you just shove .223 into a 5.56 mm gun
[0:49:01] <CLiP2> Use them Doctor Bags Pat!!
[0:49:03] <%TheSpiritof2277> why does the service rifle take .223, thought it was 5.56
[0:49:03] <+redstonej> stolen goods isntead of payment real classy
[0:49:04] <%crimsonharvest> also Pat is it worthwhile to hotkey stims for you? or do you prefer to pause to heal
[0:49:08] <+speedwagon33> Fallout 4 just doesn't compare to this for me
[0:49:08] <zafooru> gun magic

[1:18:31] <martmartez> @angriestpat. thoughts on edf 5?
[1:18:32] <%marvinbrewton25> turn ede off pat or well.. its gona be bad
[1:18:32] <%SaltyDongs> The house won't burn down if it's just on fire Pat
[1:18:33] <+kiiiirsten> Get in the Quarry and start kicking some ass
[1:18:33] <weontheultralightbeam> xqcM keep going
[1:18:34] <jgalena> Is paige's autoblow going to burn the house down?
[1:18:34] <+augurgewalt> i love all the nods to the eventual DLC that were already in the base game
[1:18:36] <DSD24> Dead Money was awesome
[1:18:38] <silvcrest> So wait, is Lonesome Road or Dead Money the worst dlc
[1:18:38] <%LargePhallusRichard> STEALTH MASTER
[1:18:40] <Stofil42> how many glitches have i missed?
[1:18:40] <natebud> Can you promise to kill ALL Centaurs? That's all I ask.
[1:18:42] <+punit216> Why is he going this way and not the other
[1:18:42] <+scroats_> all that scrap metal left behind
[1:18:43] <grauster> Dead money is best DLC
[1:18:46] <%pimpinahz> apatHoldon apatBig apatHoldon
[1:18:48] <ScreamingMeat> 0
[1:18:48] <%Dungeon00X> and there's my nuts!
[1:18:49] <%Magewart> Vegas is so close ;)
[1:18:52] <DSD24> @silvcrest New Vegas has no bad DLCs
[1:18:52] <%SweetCheeksTrap> arent there invisible deathclaws out here or something?
[1:18:52] <Falketh> Dead money is the worst
[1:18:54] <%pimpinahz> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:18:54] <Disname23> Dead Money is good and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise
[1:18:55] <LtSergei> going over black mountain and fighting through is actually easier than sneaking i think
[1:19:00] <%TheSpiritof2277> Dean Domino is my husbando
[1:19:00] <weontheultralightbeam> this is what real terror feels like
[1:19:04] <+kiiiirsten> It's fine
[1:19:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat I suggest turning off Ed-e pronto
[1:19:05] <jobbedbone> I'll thread your needle
[1:19:06] <KeystoneA1> @dis30 I like it too.
[1:19:08] <Stofil42> @dis30 I see you're a man of culture
[1:19:08] <TheEnablerr> Dead money is GREAT. The first time through.
[1:19:09] <%Magewart> Dead money is good if you aren't doing it in survival
[1:19:10] <Mr_Strut> RUN FOR IT
[1:19:12] <alrobot2014> there are deathclaws on the road like 10 ft away
[1:19:13] <$Niney_Who> @SweetCheeksTrap Nightkin, Blue Invisibility Super Mutants
[1:19:14] <+metalsiren31> Oh are we going north first?
[1:19:18] <+CuttleCrow> sweating intensifies
[1:19:18] <+moranprime> Go fist fight that death claw kappa
[1:19:19] <%Jpdodds> @silvcrest Personally, OWB is the worst one, but most people say DM is the worst and lonesome is the best
[1:19:19] <+MisterCrimson> They're little bitches, Pat. Kill em all
[1:19:20] <LtSergei> dead money is good if you're doing it in survival
[1:19:21] <DSD24> All the DLC is great in New Vegas
[1:19:22] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> use EDE as a decoy
[1:19:23] <%Magewart> Survival just makes it a chore
[1:19:24] <Djinn247> is Pat running mods ? any interesting ones ?
[1:19:24] <grauster> Always played in survival, makes dead money better!
[1:19:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Dead Money is BEST with survival
[1:19:27] <depressedpepega> hight of new vegas gameplay right here
[1:19:28] <%Remery_> Sexy Deathclaws?
[1:19:29] <+mr_dangus> he will attack
[1:19:30] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[1:19:31] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 19m.
[1:19:32] <Shisno27> no shut up don't do that
[1:19:32] <JT137> Time to make some Patty Cakes Kappa
[1:19:34] <tinypouf> he atacc
[1:19:34] <Falketh> Deadmoney is okay but Honest hearts is more fun imo
[1:19:34] <%AncelDeLambert> makes you SURVIVE
[1:19:35] <weontheultralightbeam> oh no...
[1:19:36] <%joylent_blue> ed-e is doing his best
[1:19:36] <%TeraMercier> Turn him to passive
[1:19:36] <+augurgewalt> Honest Heats is the most boring, Dead Money has amazing writing but jank gameplay and Lonesome Road is a slaughterfest during which you get sermoned by a madman
[1:19:38] <%LargePhallusRichard> dead
[1:19:38] <SuperSonichu> @AngriestPat stay high up on the rocks and you might be able to make it
[1:19:39] <corepool> i mean he can't die so just use him as bait
[1:19:40] <natebud> I think Lonesome Road was the weakest, story-wise
[1:19:40] <weontheultralightbeam> droog
[1:19:41] <+mr_dangus> passive
[1:19:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need the "True Passive Companions" mod.
[1:19:46] <%marvinbrewton25> game shifts from open world shooting a looting to survival horror!
[1:19:48] <%TeraMercier> Perfect
[1:19:50] <silvcrest> I always hear lonesome was the worst because of some dumb choice at the end
[1:19:50] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He is going to attack.
[1:19:51] <+mr_dangus> good
[1:19:51] <+CuttleCrow> he'll only attack if you get attacked
[1:19:52] <jobbedbone> who do I have to sub to to get the "damn"
[1:19:53] <StrangeCoincidence> Controller is so babies
[1:19:54] <%Magewart> I prefer honest hearts
[1:19:55] <DSD24> Old World Blues was awesome
[1:19:55] <grauster> No intro or outro for longest road unfortunately
[1:19:57] <TheEnablerr> OLD ai
[1:19:58] <+metalsiren31> OWB > DM > Honest Hearts > Lonesome Road
[1:19:58] <%TeraMercier> We weren't sure
[1:19:59] <%ribboons> Howdy Dowdy everyone, hoews the stream today?
[1:20:00] <%TheSpiritof2277> passive aggressive boy
[1:20:00] <%marvinbrewton25> but he just shot a scorpion did he not?
[1:20:02] <%Tearonex> Yo chat, is Pat playing on survival?
[1:20:04] <%Too_Much_Nukie> You need the True Passive Companions mod.
[1:20:04] <%AncelDeLambert> the game ai ain't great
[1:20:05] <TalisKanju> Is Pat getting Boone?
[1:20:06] <%pimpinahz> Ed-E takes no fuks. doesnt matter his settings
[1:20:06] <%Jpdodds> Use melee= no attacking, right?
[1:20:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> Be aggressive, B E aggressive
[1:20:12] <+CuttleCrow> the scorpion was aggroed
[1:20:14] <%TeraMercier> I don't think he's on survival
[1:20:14] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat i would through here if i were youand passive only means passive until threatened
[1:20:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Without that he will attack any enemies that get close.
[1:20:16] <Djinn247> well, scorpions are AGRESSIVE
[1:20:22] <GyroBrando> i want boone where boone at
[1:20:23] <alrobot2014> he's going by the krogan definition of passive
[1:20:25] <+kiiiirsten> Excuse me, they prefer to be called Nightkin
[1:20:25] <ComradeConquistador> Neil Degrasse Tyson's shack.
[1:20:26] <Stofil42> @StrangeCoincidence not like the fallout games are sharp enough shooters to warrant precise aim, to be fair
[1:20:27] <natebud> Talk to Neil
[1:20:28] <TheEnablerr> well...
[1:20:28] <mayorrev> Makes you wish for a nuclear winter

[1:20:33] <dsauce999> TFW WHEN NO RATSLAYER
[1:20:34] <Glassbrain> Uh, if you're uh, sure about that, pat.
[1:20:35] <+augurgewalt> pat's last words
[1:20:36] <+CuttleCrow> passive is basically "defensive"
[1:20:38] <%Too_Much_Nukie> LUL
[1:20:38] <vedammi> Pat any thoughts on the PE remake?
[1:20:39] <%SulfurousAcid> maybe duck
[1:20:40] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> THE BEAR AND THE BULL
[1:20:42] <%joylent_blue> getting Boone is like saying "i don't wanna do fights anymore"
[1:20:43] <+SWFanatic> kill them all peter
[1:20:43] <%Too_Much_Nukie> CROUCH
[1:20:44] <%Dungeon00X> Try and get them to fight each other
[1:20:44] <$Niney_Who> Remember how fast Super Mutants ran in these older games
[1:20:44] <Djinn247> Headshot everyone
[1:20:46] <a_mad_dragon> supermutants you can at least reverse-pickpocket bottlecap mines to kill
[1:20:48] <Disname23> WHO'S TALKING
[1:20:50] <TheEnablerr> if you think you're safe...
[1:20:50] <jobbedbone> whats with these messed up highways? the nukes didn't cause earthquakes
[1:20:51] <Bek_359> these are not Fallout 3 super mutants
[1:20:53] <+metalsiren31> In before invisible wall ruins everything
[1:20:54] <%pimpinahz> lol that mutants gonna push Pat's shit in!!
[1:20:55] <%Tearonex> god this soundtrack is amazing
[1:20:56] <%Dragonfang1337> paige turn off your vibrator
[1:20:58] <+augurgewalt> the advantage of death claws is that they can't shoot you
[1:20:59] <alrobot2014> @vedammi there'a parasite eve remake?
[1:21:00] <mayorrev> who said that
[1:21:02] <%Jpdodds> @jobbedbone Time
[1:21:04] <+kiiiirsten> You're gonna scrape your balls against a deathclaw
[1:21:05] <ScreamingMeat> Time watch Pat shit his ass before the Deathclaws and Super Mutants push it back in
[1:21:06] <dekkitout> headshot? a supermutant? at this level? HA!
[1:21:08] <TheEnablerr> Devs say no
[1:21:10] <Stofil42> you can climb that mountain
[1:21:12] <KeystoneA1> NCR safehouse is around here I think
[1:21:12] <Glassbrain> "I'd rather get shot to death with lasers immediately upon being seen than even having the chance to run away from the danger." Pat, 2019
[1:21:13] <Bek_359> these are super high-level mutants with real good gear and armor
[1:21:13] <grauster> parasite eve remake would be most welcome
[1:21:14] <StrangeCoincidence> @Stofil42 actually that is tru, the controller is more comfy for terrain explorin and you have VATS anyway
[1:21:16] <TalisKanju> @AngriestPat What companion are you going to get?
[1:21:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @jobbedbone its a mix of time and the fact that nukes can push a lot of earth around

[1:59:00] <%rdark_ksu> go with cass plz
[1:59:01] <radical_skeleton> vodka cures radiation poisoning, i learned that from stalker
[1:59:02] <%Tearonex> yes it can
[1:59:03] <Shisno27> everything can be irradiated if you're radiated enough
[1:59:04] <%ECRead> it absolutely can
[1:59:04] <rararasputino> Radiation and infection are very different things
[1:59:06] <TranquilTurnip> I thought everything could be irradiated
[1:59:07] <NeutrinoInteraction> Everything can be irradiated
[1:59:07] <%TheWaifuMeat> The Nuka Cola rum is irradiated
[1:59:08] <+fantom_flasch> anything can be irradiated
[1:59:08] <alrobot2014> there's irradiated whiskey ingame somewhere
[1:59:09] <$nademonkey1100> this isnt stalker
[1:59:09] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Yep.
[1:59:09] <dekkitout> anything can be irradiated if you try hard enough tajC
[1:59:10] <fruit_pie_the_magician> EVERYTHING CAN BE iRRADIATED
[1:59:10] <Admiral_PopnFresh> It does in S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[1:59:10] <natebud> Vodka helps with radiation posioning very very slightly in real life
[1:59:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @avarice99 that is the exact rule I use, it's the only thing to live by
[1:59:17] <Sunstalker> Armors good to sell if you repair it
[1:59:21] <%splosiontactics> So weirdly twitch will not give me notifications for this stream. What's up with that?
[1:59:22] <+Nomicro4u> Alcohol reduces radiation in ATOM RPG
[1:59:22] <randomp141> @AngriestPat In game yes, in life yes. Just like how antivenom can become posioned.

[2:13:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Ahhhhhh shit, I’m late. For New Vegas of all games too...what’d I miss? I can tell we’re at Nipton, but did Pat go off the main road for certain quests?
[2:13:58] <%Bree_Bear> fallout 4 is a shallow husk of a game imo..
[2:14:07] <+PukingGoombas> What faction is Pat going for?
[2:14:08] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Bad mutts. Bad!
[2:14:10] <%Bree_Bear> this tho. mmmmm

[2:14:28] <godsabove> i just got here, did pat kill Vulpes?
[2:14:30] <+u_should_feel_bad> fo4 is okay. NV is just better
[2:14:35] <AirlineFood74> yes
[2:14:35] <TheEnablerr> the one time to wear faction is armor is ony to get into New Vegas through McAraan
[2:14:36] <+augurgewalt> Fallout 4 is simplistic as hell and you have seen basically everything the game has to offer after the tutorial
[2:14:38] <+PukingGoombas> @lewdskeletor13 hell yeah. best run

[2:15:41] <%lewdskeletor13> NO
[2:15:42] <godsabove> fuck hardcore
[2:15:55] <TalisKanju> Playing on Hardcore would force Pat to craft
[2:15:57] <eldritchart> @AngriestPat try picking up the body and dragging it, it helps.
[2:16:03] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> So what sidequests have we done yet?
[2:16:06] <Gruhunchously> Hardcore just adds a lot of micromanaging. Which is fine if that's your thing, but not really entertaining stream material.
[2:16:13] <JittersCaffeine> F4 is just an endless loop of creating settlments to get resources to make more settlements
[2:16:13] <%SiameseSneeze> Hardcore is fun
[2:16:15] <Big_King_Coconut> sunset sass is the best medicine
[2:16:16] <%AbnormalVoid> Mentats or Mantits? 🤔
[2:16:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Hardcore is for people who don’t want to have fun apatWhat
[2:16:20] <%crimsonharvest> mentats is basically ADHD medicine

[2:16:36] <+u_should_feel_bad> I like hardcore. But i have beat NV like 8 times

[2:16:42] <Togamdiron> @SleepyMaribo But pee is stored in the balls.
[2:16:43] <the_mental_punk> I like hardcore cause its not as annoying as it could've been

[2:17:06] <+kiiiirsten> YES I looked up in time to catch the pug in the dog show
[2:17:10] <Gruhunchously> There's a skill book in the Mayor's Office. A science one too, relevant to your interests.
[2:17:10] <%joylent_blue> DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap i was a tad late as well, but i know he ran the sloan shortcut to the clinic to get INT implant, and he killed Vulpes for his hat
[2:17:12] <%umbypokochan> i didn't even know there was a flashlight when i played o.o
[2:17:12] <+havepawnwilltravel> so what faction is he going now?
[2:17:13] <TheEnablerr> The vanilla Pip Boy light is near useless

[2:17:33] <dekkitout> things 4 has that other fallout games doesnt: dogmeat dressup
[2:17:33] <+augurgewalt> 4 has better gunplay technically, but you play RPGs for the complete package, not for shooting that feels okay
[2:17:43] <dekkitout> and no, mods dont count SeriousSloth
[2:17:44] <BakemonoGaming> Generally the shooty shooty and general feel, that and i found the world told more of a story. The main story was crap though.

[2:20:01] <b1gboss007> GRAMPA PAT

[2:20:06] <McPumpkin> Familiarity?
[2:20:06] <AggsMK7> Always target the eyes
[2:20:07] <%ahegotrigger> theyre not really that fun
[2:20:08] <majima666> i played 2, but it wasnt really my style of game.
[2:20:10] <%DavidSanChan> Less shame
[2:20:10] <AoG_JarlRaven> Pat is old.

[2:20:15] <%ssjklyco> Familiarity
[2:20:15] <Grennold> I hope OW doesn't go to much for that Borderlands tone in the trailer
[2:20:15] <%CrazyD1amond> Recettear is a funny concept but playing the game actually sucks
[2:20:17] <%crimsonharvest> call me up i can be your fallout 2 guide i wrote a damn faq
[2:20:17] <%TheDullaMAN> He feels a "Sense of Right"
[2:20:18] <+Exyoh> I'm super excited for Outer Worlds. I almost feel sorry for Bethesda, falling so hard on their asses during the announcement window.
[2:20:20] <+BizarreRevolver> play the modded fixed versions
[2:20:21] <DSD24> Ghost is cool!
[2:20:21] <heybenice> Isn’t there a companion in this building
[2:20:24] <%PalmtopNami> I feel that, everytime i go back. Its a sense of calming familiarity and joy.
[2:20:26] <frogurtz> New Vegas just feels good to play.
[2:20:26] <$Cobra743> Grandpa shortpants
[2:20:27] <grimnier> You should take a look at Oxhorns lore channels for it. Goes really in depth
[2:20:27] <majima666> i'll admit 3 got me into fallout
[2:20:28] <%deviljhojho94> Familiarity?
[2:20:28] <Stofil42> I went through both a few years back and honestly aside from 1 being jank both were fine
[2:20:29] <redbearrusskie> BEST GIRL
[2:20:29] <dekkitout> literally nothing is worse than fo76
[2:20:30] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat nostalgia? and out worlds looks good so far and knowing obsidian is making it puts me at ease in twmrs of will it be good
[2:20:32] <+pswayde> Like a happy comfort, same thing you get when you snuggle in a blanket with a can of redbull
[2:20:33] <spawnzombie> Fallout 1 and 2 are from 97 and 98. You dont have to be that old to have played them
[2:20:34] <+Theophilus567> I’d like to see those games played. Badly
[2:20:34] <the_mental_punk> i wanna play more 1 and 2 but i have such a hard time adjust to how it plays
[2:20:35] <Big_King_Coconut> get a tan!
[2:20:35] <Geno4344> ranger ghost Kreygasm
[2:20:37] <ComradeConquistador> Outer Worlds is gonna be the breath of fresh air after the fart gas of 76.
[2:20:39] <DSD24> Nipton was filled with Thots
[2:20:41] <Gruhunchously> Ghost is indeed best girl.
[2:20:42] <godsabove> @u_should_feel_bad like the tribals from various areas speak modified english or a completely different language
[2:20:42] <TranquilTurnip> Fallout 4 is my favorite post Apocalyptic Hoarder and Trashdiving simulator
[2:20:43] <+IronPickle> like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in a while
[2:20:43] <AoG_JarlRaven> Fallout 3 is fine.
[2:20:46] <%ahegotrigger> lmao
[2:20:48] <%OwlLightningMage> 3 is actually still good. 4 is bad
[2:20:51] <blademaster247> @CrazyD1amond I found it zen and charming but I haven't put a whole bunch of time in it yet
[2:20:53] <%ahegotrigger> even the NCR agrees
[2:20:53] <%ItsRatman> Nipton sounds like a nice place to live.
[2:20:53] <AirlineFood74> @dekkitout Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel exists
[2:20:54] <LtSergei> fallout 3 is trash
[2:20:54] <%masterpiecejeremy> It's fucked? Nah IT'S
[2:20:55] <KronusX7> @lewdskeletor13 the whole "original creators of Fallout and Fallout NV" stuff. Idk guess it really isn't their fault as those are good accolades you can use to show your merit, but people seem to have just taken that as "man hahaha fuck Bethesda" and it's just came off as really spiteful. The Outer Worlds subreddit is basically just an anti-Bethesda sub
[2:20:55] <Sloavon> fuck you legion
[2:20:58] <%OwlLightningMage> 76 is a joke LUL
[2:20:59] <%abadbadman> hey guess where i got this hat from
[2:21:00] <indig0bird> Fuck you Legion
[2:21:01] <Geno4344> why does ranger ghost have literally one rule 34 pic
[2:21:01] <%snow_bush> Does the legion deserve to get burned by the legion?
[2:21:05] <dannyb84> Everything post-Morrowind = freakin bad
[2:21:06] <dekkitout> lalalal- cant hear you= lalalala
[2:21:08] <Geno4344> is it because she's so pure
[2:21:09] <the_mental_punk> part of me hopes valenwood is absolutely terrible
[2:21:11] <sparkboy777> LOCKPICK
[2:21:12] <indig0bird> Although JC Dentley did a good job
[2:21:12] <natebud> I decided to go exploring as soon as the game started in Fallout 1, found the Boneyard church, got locked in the basement and accidentally started the final dungeon. That was Fallout 1 for me.

[2:21:41] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Pump that shiz into repair.
[2:21:43] <godsabove> @KronusX7 yeah but on the other hand bethesda's kind of a really shitty company and deserves it

[2:22:15] <KronusX7> To everyone saying Bethesda screwed Obsidian over. It didn't. Zenimax is the one that screwed them over
[2:22:15] <+Exyoh> It's not Obsidian's fault that a cheeky jab came after such a blunder with FO76.
[2:22:16] <+sixcubit> explosivr 20
[2:22:18] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Explosives so you can stop dying from mines.

[2:22:29] <godsabove> I usually try to get repair up to 90 by the time I reach level 14, so I can get jury-rigging as soon as possible
[2:22:30] <silvcrest> Does he even have the magazines?
[2:22:33] <%TheSpiritof2277> Jury rig is so worth it
[2:22:33] <%TheDullaMAN> Fine
[2:22:35] <Chocolate_Burrito> that works

[2:22:48] <randomp141> @AngriestPat You know the Legion would ultimately lose the war unless you take over New Vegas?
[2:22:49] <natebud> Put all your points into big weapons
[2:22:52] <indig0bird> Need moar speech
[2:22:54] <+augurgewalt> Jury rig is straight up the best perk in the game and every character desperately needs it
[2:22:54] <Gruhunchously> After the Fallout 76 fiasco, people aren't feeling charitable towards Bethesda right now.
[2:22:55] <Ugato> Terrible it has no energy weapons
[2:22:55] <the_mental_punk> i rather the fallout 4 building mechanics was like a phonegame where you selected a certain area to become something like a hospital or a shop over time as your character went out adventuring
[2:22:56] <KronusX7> @dannyb84 Zenimax owns Bethesda
[2:22:56] <ScreamingMeat> Magazines boost skills by 10-15 temporarily
[2:22:57] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AirlineFood74 That's literally the first magazine type you get.
[2:22:58] <%VRNK> jury rigging most busted perk in new vegas

[2:23:06] <godsabove> that's fair
[2:23:06] <AirlineFood74> oh probably i dunno
[2:23:08] <reiju_22> :O
[2:23:08] <%bread_assassin> Jury Rigging is one of the best perks in the game by far.
[2:23:08] <TheEnablerr> Jury rigging is the shit but it needs 90 repair
[2:23:09] <FracturedImage> you spiteful bastard
[2:23:09] <TheTunnelSn8ke> Jury Rigging is a godsend

[2:23:32] <+Daidis> it's so good x4
[2:23:32] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Commando is for baby bitch kids.
[2:23:32] <+bonelord> I don't think I ever used Commando.
[2:23:34] <indig0bird> Shotgun Surgeon is fantastic
[2:23:34] <natebud> I've never not taken commando, its the most fine
[2:23:35] <Sunstalker> shotgun surgeon is better
[2:23:36] <+augurgewalt> vats is for noobs imo
[2:23:36] <GlockentopHoods> commando is for dirty VATS users

[2:24:01] <GyroBrando> and then take boone and just break the game
[2:24:02] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Not really, VATS isn’t as useful as it is in 3
[2:24:04] <Meekest> Wrong one Pat

[2:28:57] <wirblewomble> skill books are shit anyways
[2:28:57] <%AncelDeLambert> .... who cares about ALL of them?
[2:28:59] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @schroedingersferret fuuuuuuck, I’d love to see a mod that’d make a melee run of New Vegas like Yakuza...
[2:29:01] <+ThirstyMichael> @AngriestPat what's your base Charisma if you're min/maxing?
[2:29:01] <BakemonoGaming> You could almost say you cant... Comprehend... Their location!
[2:29:02] <%AncelDeLambert> just FIND them
[2:29:03] <+u_should_feel_bad> pro modder
[2:29:04] <%joylent_blue> you have so many level ups in NV with all the DLC that skill books really don't need to be minmaxed
[2:29:04] <dekkitout> hates crafting and temp buffs, glad i dont have stickler foibles....
[2:29:04] <wirblewomble> magazines are op
[2:29:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat's talking crazy again
[2:29:10] <+Fallout48> Running out of ammo in fallout by mid game is basically a joke on normal and below.
[2:29:12] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Why not get a mod that lets you take more companions? That way you can have ED-E, Wrex and whoever else
[2:29:13] <redbearrusskie> yes they do!
[2:29:13] <rararasputino> They run out of special ammo

[2:29:31] <ape_hawk> they run out of ammo if they are using a weapon that you give them
[2:29:31] <%ahegotrigger> only for guns that arent their default
[2:29:33] <pureticly> it's just a radius of light i prefer how 4 does it with the whole flashlight thing
[2:29:33] <AggsMK7> What have you DONE?
[2:29:33] <PSI_Guy95> Install the less bright bright pipboy mod!
[2:29:35] <+bonelord> They run out of ammo except for their very basic weapons.
[2:29:35] <Booette94> HOLD ON
[2:29:36] <%OwlLightningMage> They only run out of special ammo. Pat doesn't make special ammo either way
[2:29:36] <dekkitout> like looking into gods asshole ResidentSleeper
[2:29:36] <%bread_assassin> They do if you give them different guns. They only have infinite with default weapons. @AngriestPat
[2:29:37] <+alphonseisbest> yes they do

[2:29:49] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 29m.
[2:29:54] <+augurgewalt> Grandma never runs out of ammo
[2:29:54] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is playing on normal so it's fine
[2:29:55] <%ahegotrigger> you should give boone a 12.7 smg
[2:29:56] <+Theophilus567> Only their default weapons do not run out.
[2:29:58] <TalisKanju> Pat loves Boone

[2:31:25] <CrowsSmallNest> !raffle
[2:31:29] <crimson983> Personally I hate the fact that companions take real ammo just to use any decent weapons late game.
[2:31:36] <wolf_hurricane> Please tell me we're at least going to get a co-op stream with Woolie and Pat for DMC5
[2:31:38] <%mimikyu92> the one silver lining is that now that the zaibatsu has ceased to be, the ustabiaz has as well
[2:31:39] <wolf_hurricane> that's all I want
[2:31:40] <dekkitout> eh- i like yharnam fm better
[2:31:48] <+bonelord> @wolf_hurricane You and me both dude.
[2:31:50] <%joylent_blue> @wolf_hurricane same
[2:31:53] <CrowsSmallNest> @crimson983 Why not just have them fo melee?
[2:31:54] <+Aetropos> PEEPEE
[2:31:56] <+CuttleCrow> I have so much ammo late game, doesn't matter
[2:32:04] <Cranky_Construct> Is the ustabiaz still a thing
[2:32:08] <wolf_hurricane> no
[2:32:09] <the_mental_punk> honestly the best friends ending is like mcr ending, better on their own terms instead ofcrashing and burning
[2:32:12] <%OwlLightningMage> You get so much good late game ammo from crafting
[2:32:13] <+CuttleCrow> just give them ammo for a type of gun you don't use / cheap ammo
[2:32:18] <%ShiftyFish> Pat should try S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[2:32:22] <wolf_hurricane> get out of here stalker
[2:32:24] <masterofthemash> is the stream over?
[2:32:25] <%FrostMass22> What would a death claw's penis look like?
[2:32:26] <wolf_hurricane> no
[2:32:26] <PSI_Guy95> too bad Pat doesn't think the crafting system exists
[2:32:27] <%joylent_blue> no
[2:32:27] <wolf_hurricane> pat is pissing
[2:32:28] <+SteelC0W> CHAT WHO HERE IS HUGE
[2:32:29] <%ItsRatman> nope
[2:32:29] <Cranky_Construct> Nah, break time
[2:32:29] <indig0bird> The crafting perks are fine
[2:32:31] <+bonelord> I second that. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is amazing.
[2:32:31] <DSD24> @masterofthemash He took a break
[2:32:33] <+Aetropos> @wolf_hurricane you typed it faster than me
[2:32:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> No, Pat is poopig
[2:32:44] <wolf_hurricane> oh man
[2:32:44] <indig0bird> If you could craft Alien Cells then the game would be super broken
[2:32:44] <Archmortal> I'm two hours late, how much has Pat fucked up tonight
[2:32:46] <TranquilTurnip> I always love crafting mechanics, I'm a dope for them
[2:32:46] <wolf_hurricane> have you seen poopig
[2:32:47] <crimson983> True but if your fighting something that’s real tough having companions to take off aggro can be helpful
[2:32:47] <+Aetropos> LOUD PEE?
[2:32:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Big dumps
[2:32:47] <%FrostMass22> Pat is a poo pig
[2:32:48] <Jack_DT> pooping Pat
[2:32:48] <dekkitout> does brb mean goodnight in another country?
[2:32:49] <%afronooch> Stalker spooked me the first time I tried playing it

[2:32:51] <wolf_hurricane> i havent seen poopig in forever
[2:32:52] <nina9669> Futa mod
[2:32:54] <%afronooch> i think i was 13 or 14
[2:32:55] <indig0bird> But would make those skills instantly more valuable

[2:37:25] <%jiin6> fallout new vegas where you are the P3 protaginist
[2:37:25] <spawnzombie> Its a cozy game
[2:37:25] <+sogeki_dan> When is new pod?
[2:37:27] <+Aetropos> new vegas is my favourite game of all time
[2:37:27] <%TheSpiritof2277> NV is the shit
[2:37:27] <%Prism_Wing> I'm just listening because Fallout bores me.
[2:37:28] <KeystoneA1> Best Fallout
[2:37:28] <dekkitout> this just in: people like fun games
[2:37:30] <%OwlLightningMage> More of us are showing up because of the destruction of the channel too LUL
[2:37:31] <indig0bird> New Vegas is a good game
[2:37:32] <%SweetCheeksTrap> and i get like, 20 whole viewers per stream lol
[2:37:33] <godsabove> I mean the only reason I'm here and not watching old AH videos is because I saw FNV
[2:37:33] <Downcom1ng> You need to wake up Pat
[2:37:35] <+bonelord> More here for the Pat than the game honestly.
[2:37:37] <$avarice99> metal Gear Pat: The phantom chat
[2:37:41] <alrobot2014> new vegas is a game about yuri lowenthal killing himself, laura bailey, and liam o'brien
[2:37:45] <PSI_Guy95> @chief413 i can't believe Pat beat Daigo when Woolie didn't
[2:37:47] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Essentially PS4 Spider-Man’s Peter Parker and Mary Jane are the male and female Courier respectively.
[2:37:52] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> will NEVER be finished
[2:37:53] <crimson983> Well many people consider new Vegas to be the best
[2:37:54] <+Snaketsu> the fallout 4 engine LUL
[2:37:55] <Cthulos> what's the point
[2:37:57] <petpurplepanda> Watch F4Miami trailer
[2:38:02] <Cthulos> it's the same engine
[2:38:02] <Chocolate_Burrito> theres a trailer
[2:38:03] <+BaronVonFatty> didnt new vegas get cancelled
[2:38:03] <pseudomuse> come for the new Vegas, stay for the skelmo
[2:38:04] <%FunTruker> Theres a youtube chanell
[2:38:08] <Chocolate_Burrito> and a demo
[2:38:08] <ape_hawk> theres the first ten minute gameplay thing
[2:38:08] <AirlineFood74> It's the same engine
[2:38:10] <%lizard0tm> @AngriestPat Skyblivion is being developed as well
[2:38:10] <%RogueInfinity> Have FAITH Paaat
[2:38:11] <%Dragonfang1337> what is with fallout modders fascination with modding other fallout games into other fallout games
[2:38:12] <%jiin6> you haven't seen the miami trailer?
[2:38:14] <%ItsRatman> So it will be done when Outer Worlds come out, got it
[2:38:18] <%OwlLightningMage> It's crazy that Outer Worlds is using a real engine for once LUL
[2:38:23] <+augurgewalt> imagine a mod being infinitely better than the base game
[2:38:25] <Cthulos> miami looks interesting
[2:38:26] <%ZeroMP_> they have a plan, Pat. have some god damn FAiTH
[2:38:27] <%TheSpiritof2277> Same janky ass Gamebryo engine with some patchwork
[2:38:27] <Spidermustdie> they do blog updates every few weeks, its getting constant dev
[2:38:28] <ScreamingMeat> They're remaking the game in FO4 from the ground up
[2:38:29] <TranquilTurnip> @lizard0tm I feel like thats been in development for like 6 years now
[2:38:31] <%homelesstwinky> Fallout: Miami has a promising trailer
[2:38:43] <+PurpleRoseTattoo> Well after 3 hours of progress found out Subautica has no auto save
[2:38:44] <SubjectX07x> They are remaking and replacing it all, but given the trailer they are being quite certain to find people with voices matching characters, the Doc Mitchell VA is a dead ringer.
[2:38:46] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Personally, 1 is my favorite Fallout, but yeah, I understand New Vegas being best for everyone; it’s riiiight behind 1 for me
[2:38:48] <%Luna_Ashford> Don't forget Fallout Cascadia!!
[2:38:50] <indig0bird> Lol true
[2:38:51] <majima666> its like those mods for gta 3 that were based on SA
[2:38:55] <majima666> etc
[2:38:57] <%Shady_Zaku> !uptime
[2:38:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 39m.
[2:39:00] <+Sinister_Aglet> it's not open world tho
[2:39:00] <%lizard0tm> @TranquilTurnip I think it's been only like 3 years
[2:39:00] <Coystick> FINALLY
[2:39:00] <randomp141> I'm into this.
[2:39:03] <%jiin6> Outer Worlds not using the creation engine apatDab
[2:39:03] <majima666> same engine basically
[2:39:03] <TheEnablerr> time for texture load-ins
[2:39:04] <TranquilTurnip> @Luna_Ashford oh yeah that looks awesome
[2:39:05] <+lexitheshark> Fucking FINALLY
[2:39:05] <%lizard0tm> Not sure tho
[2:39:09] <dekkitout> hopefully i can sprint jump in outer worlds
[2:39:10] <crimson983> @angriestpat did you hear about the new Vegas mod frontier? A huge mod with lots of promise like tanks and vertibirds!
[2:39:10] <indig0bird> It looks like a response to every stupid decision Bethesda has made in the alst 5 years
[2:39:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> Its a Bethesda-em-up.
[2:39:16] <%Too_Much_Nukie> It's closer to RAGE than to Fallout.
[2:39:18] <%TheSpiritof2277> YEP
[2:39:19] <%TheDullaMAN> Bethesdumb, amirite?
[2:39:19] <Calek> I can't believe NotFallout is using an engine from this millenium
[2:39:22] <+Blarghnox> you mean fallout new vegas 2 in space?
[2:39:23] <spawnzombie> OBSOLETE AND POINTLESS
[2:39:25] <%snow_bush> But then they'd have to learn something else.
[2:39:26] <%korth367> it just works tho
[2:39:27] <+Ssoline> job secuirty
[2:39:29] <+AtlasMcCoy> I just got back, what fucked up pat?
[2:39:31] <TheEnablerr> Gamebryo is JANK
[2:39:31] <rararasputino> No license fee and easy modding is the reason
[2:39:31] <radical_skeleton> if bethesda tried to change engines they'd probably fuck up even worse
[2:39:31] <silvcrest> but youtubers keep telling me the engine is fine!?
[2:39:32] <+Nomicro4u> Is it really tho? Is greed really not a simple motivation?
[2:39:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Bethesda upper brass are fucking morons
[2:39:33] <%Rngiddion> Bethesda doesnt wanna give Epic the sales percent for using Unreal 4
[2:39:33] <%faegbeard> It's a new engine though we swear :^)
[2:39:33] <%skybriel1> Im just excited Obsidian gets to make a game without being fucked for once
[2:39:33] <%ZeOrbling> they want all that money
[2:39:34] <Them00n> It's probably gonna be closer to vtm than a bethesda game.
[2:39:34] <%joylent_blue> a decision by bethesda is baffling? SHOCKER
[2:39:35] <%laserbeaming> I sure hope outer worlds has mod support
[2:39:35] <%snow_bush> Why learn when you can copy paste?
[2:39:36] <alrobot2014> don't they at least have access to idtech?
[2:39:39] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@NWR_James) (warning)

[2:39:42] <%lizard0tm> Bethesdas engine is literally a taped together slimy pile if shit
[2:39:42] <troytaco> copyrights issue?
[2:39:46] <%SweetCheeksTrap> @angriestpat BUT JOB SECURITY
[2:39:49] <TranquilTurnip> @lizard0tm I looked it up, it started as a passion project in 2013.
[2:39:52] <spawnzombie> Gamebryo is older than most people in this chat, its insanity.
[2:39:52] <pseudomuse> Bethesda is trash tho
[2:39:53] <Shastafield> it just works
[2:39:55] <KeystoneA1> It's too bad Konami probably won't let go of the Fox Engine, because I'd love to see a Fallout game made in that
[2:39:55] <%AncelDeLambert> totally
[2:39:55] <%NWR_James> @Moobot sucks
[2:39:55] <PSI_Guy95> But then they don't need to use people with railway hats to make railways
[2:39:56] <randomp141> @AngriestPat What's this Unreal Engine Obsidian game again? I wanna be able to pick it up.
[2:39:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's definitelt Borderlands by way of Fallout though
[2:39:58] <Dr_Donkey_Brains> And yet Bethesda makes better games
[2:39:58] <crimson983> @angriestpat what’s more confusing is I’ve heard people defend that dumb engine.
[2:39:58] <topkkekk> the engine is good. bethesda cant get anything working tho
[2:40:00] <%joylent_blue> Bethesda is such trash now
[2:40:00] <%AncelDeLambert> I'd put money on that
[2:40:01] <%lizard0tm> Ah
[2:40:06] <+Blankets_and_Tea> i'm very curious to see how starfield and elder scrolls 6 will be received
[2:40:06] <%DarkSodaMcFaceHead> They may be too cowardice
[2:40:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> FALLOUT MARS
[2:40:08] <%AncelDeLambert> That's a bet I'll make
[2:40:09] <+augurgewalt> they don't want to give up even an ounce of control, EA are the same with frostbyte
[2:40:10] <natebud> It really will be a big success. This is certain
[2:40:12] <Sloavon> DOOM should be an Unreal game
[2:40:14] <captainpodock> Todd wont allow it
[2:40:17] <%lizard0tm> Todd Coward won't allow it
[2:40:20] <AirlineFood74> @randomp141 QaizerArt ce Combat 7
[2:40:20] <+Kriptin> If they're porting New Vegas why can't they use the damn original VA.
[2:40:24] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> cheer300 Howdy Ho pat. Was wondering if you ever played onimusha back in the day. If so what did you think of it and do you think you will be streaming the remaster that is coming out?
[2:40:28] <%Luna_Ashford> Also Fallout The Frontier

[2:40:32] <+Prince_Potato42> @AngriestPat Do you have any links to a modpack that you use for New Vegas?
[2:40:33] <pseudomuse> outer worlds facial animations are uncanny valley for me
[2:40:33] <xanerts> *working*
[2:40:33] <ScreamingMeat> Obsidian even passive aggressively throws shade at bethesda in the trailer by mentioning the Fallout games THEY made
[2:40:34] <crimson983> Fallout: New Space !
[2:40:34] <randomp141> @AirlineFood74 TY.
[2:40:37] <AirlineFood74> @randomp141 Just kidding it's Outer Worlds
[2:40:37] <%skybriel1> Okay but what if the games are still hot garbage even after switching engines
[2:40:39] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Most likely the Outer Worlds was most likely how it was now for the longest time, it was coincidence that 76 fucking crashed super hard.
[2:40:40] <+Kriptin> Doom's on Id Tech, the good engine Bethesda has.

[2:45:33] <%TheDullaMAN> Yeah, but the Overwatch women are hot, right?
[2:45:41] <%RogueInfinity> Overwatch is worse than League
[2:45:42] <Ugato> “It’s toxic” says the FGC fan
[2:45:42] <InsomniacPersona> Overwatch dead game
[2:45:43] <%RogueInfinity> Much worse
[2:45:43] <%AstroFalcon09> pretty much
[2:45:44] <DSD24> @TheDullaMAN Yes they are
[2:45:44] <%sparrrow_> yeah why are these cartoony games more toxic than stuff like CoD?
[2:45:44] <ScreamingMeat> @Too_Much_Nukie It is when New Vegas is objectively the best modern Fallout game based on writing alone.
[2:45:46] <%jiin6> Overwatch is boring
[2:45:48] <Rhinoprotoss> Not really
[2:45:49] <+augurgewalt> it's like a moba, so of course it attracts the same kind of toxic dip****
[2:45:54] <JohnHP> I'm already Torbjorn
[2:45:55] <+lexitheshark> Activision Blizzard are firing their CFO @AngriestPat
[2:45:56] <spawnzombie> The FGC is FAR from toxic

[2:46:16] <rockworm> i never played overwatch but I played a little bit of Paladins am I qualified to talk like I know everything?
[2:46:18] <%Remery_> Overwatch's Switch Mechanic ultimately ruins the game. :)
[2:46:18] <NeroCapone> Overwatch rule 34 really keeps me from bringing out the old noose FeelsGoodMan
[2:46:18] <benjiFG> picking who you want to play? what?

[2:46:45] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @ScreamingMeat You're doing that thing where you're saying your opinion is objectively true and therefore anything even tangentially related to your opinion must be a reflection of your opinion. When it's just Obsidian saying "here's what you might know us from" like every single other trailer does in both video games and movies.

[2:47:03] <%flagi64> are we at the end of the stream? saddd

[2:48:54] <natebud> 4 makes me sad

[2:49:05] <+Aetropos> What game is Avellone working on now, that zombie game sequel?
[2:49:08] <orcus12> 3 was a decent starter but thats it
[2:49:11] <xiccy> 4 is great
[2:49:12] <%Too_Much_Nukie> And Sawyer didn't write New Vegas anyway, he's director not writer.
[2:49:15] <natebud> SEAN
[2:49:16] <+bonelord> 4 is the DMC2 of Onimusha.

[2:51:53] <%Too_Much_Nukie> That was golden entertainment.

[2:52:51] <PSI_Guy95> Might be best if they both had experience with it before playing. A double blind playthrough would be nuts tho

[2:52:59] <%Dragonfang1337> custom emotes that anyone can use on your channel
[2:52:59] <Fynale> @AngriestPat better twitch tv emotes can be gifs
[2:52:59] <+augurgewalt> FeelsBadMan
[2:53:00] <GyroBrando> they better emotes
[2:53:00] <AirlineFood74> FeelsBadMan
[2:53:03] <MaverickHaunter> FeelsBadMan

[2:53:14] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, ONE?
[2:53:15] <godsabove> ...9?
[2:53:15] <+CuttleCrow> minmaxing LUL bullshit
[2:53:15] <+ThirstyMichael> @AngriestPat hell yeah, you know
[2:53:15] <Them00n> Pat would be a nightmare to play DnD with.
[2:53:19] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 9 + implant = 10.
[2:53:20] <+ilasper1> 9 because he got boost from implant to 10
[2:53:21] <DetroitSentai> Emotes suck tho so yeah
[2:53:22] <petpurplepanda> Implant
[2:53:23] <%Ahack13> Did someone just as PAT if he was min/maxing?
[2:53:24] <KaseKaizer> SUB (puke) OPTIMAL
[2:53:25] <%Rngiddion> He upgraded it from 9 to 10 dudes
[2:53:26] <+Puppa_Warpig> Ahh
[2:53:28] <%TheMattman1313> Chrome Extension that add quality of life stuff to vanilla Twitch. Also adds more emotes like LUL and FeelsBadMan
[2:53:28] <jobbedbone> does the int implant give you more skill points on level up
[2:53:29] <%TheDude8D> gotta go check our gun runners!
[2:53:30] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, Pat is the most awkward, cringy fuck in the wasteland

[2:53:47] <Fynale> lol pat moves like he has tank controls in a non tank control game
[2:53:49] <+hillbillypowpow> one CHAR sounds about right
[2:53:49] <jobbedbone> oh
[2:53:50] <+ThirstyMichael> @chat charisma is a dump stat, there's only one or two Charisma checks in the game, and no useful perks
[2:53:53] <%Fidel_Castbro> you might as well go to Gun Runners since you have a fast travel point near the strip
[2:53:53] <+augurgewalt> you just walk by without giving Cass a howdy?

[2:54:15] <Fynale> all charisma does in new vegas is boost how much damage your companions do

[2:58:57] <+augurgewalt> Roboscorpions!
[2:58:58] <+dragoon001914> @mrboo001 You can just pump skill points into Speech and Barter, Charisma is utterly useless.
[2:58:59] <SubjectX07x> DUST is super cool, and mind numbingly difficult at the start.
[2:59:03] <Gruhunchously> So which way are we going exactly?
[2:59:05] <Spidermustdie> SUBSTANTIALLY
[2:59:06] <+kiiiirsten> YEAH GO GO GO

[2:59:17] <crimson983> @angriestpat ever visited the thorn?
[2:59:17] <hazardkujacker> @Gruhunchously Laura Bailey *harp music*
[2:59:18] <natebud> weird bullshit for another day
[2:59:19] <%violetheart> Luck influences the gambling odds so much that at 10 luck you can't lose.
[2:59:19] <%Ascethetic> Dust?
[2:59:19] <ScreamingMeat> Touch the bullshit
[2:59:20] <+Aetropos> 👁️
[2:59:20] <+InugamiTheHound> sonicfox is no longer king of the furries. Pat is our new king
[2:59:30] <+mrboo001> @AirlineFood74 @dragoon001914 so... you can have 100 Speech with 1 Charisma and still talk to twin right?

[2:59:35] <TheChampionofBoxes> Is pat gonna do the DLCs too?
[2:59:41] <+u_should_feel_bad> I think Pat needs to play Lost in Vivo. It looks right up his alley
[2:59:42] <+Fallout48> Pat do you have a plan for when you'll dlc? Recommended levels or post game?
[2:59:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> is pat gonna work for mr hous
[2:59:43] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:43] <nah_stradamus> pat is more the court jester of the furries
[2:59:44] <TheEnablerr> the "intended" way
[2:59:45] <+AtlasMcCoy> Pat is basically a huge cheater but not the hugest cheater
[2:59:46] <%ahegotrigger> good thank you Pat
[2:59:47] <$avarice99> jury rigging is great unless youre sloppy and use a modded sniper rifle to fix up a shotgun
[2:59:48] <+augurgewalt> it's not sequence breaking when you are supposed to be able to do it
[2:59:53] <Gruhunchously> *Loads shotgun* Shame
[2:59:53] <+ShadowArcangel> yaknowatimean?

[3:00:36] <%ahegotrigger> watch the traffic cone
[3:00:36] <KeystoneA1> There's no bighorns around there
[3:00:36] <Gruhunchously> Hey, watch out for the red traffic cones. Some of them have mines underneath.

[3:01:44] <$SleepyMaribo> thats a funny way of saying keep boon on your team forever
[3:01:47] <+bonelord> B....but Boon...
[3:01:47] <hazardkujacker> @XxbkgamerxXyes actually
[3:01:48] <%ronyncato87> apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead apatCrazyhead
[3:01:50] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @mrboo001 highly persuasive misanthrope is the best.
[3:01:50] <$Niney_Who> Look at that Snake-Worshipping loser
[3:01:53] <+kiiiirsten> You out-snuck his sneak

[3:02:00] <+IronPickle> who is your favorite companion?
[3:02:01] <%narusao> guess you could say he wasn't very lucky
[3:02:06] <gerahwar> That is one dead boi
[3:02:07] <%Slaardacity> off to work for me, have a good night gang
[3:02:09] <royal_kun> hohoho
[3:02:09] <TheEnablerr> @XxbkgamerxX there are, don't recommend having them ALL at once. interiors become a mess
[3:02:15] <MisterGrowing> @XxbkgamerxX yes but its kinda lame tbh to have all or a few following you makes fights boring to me
[3:02:17] <hazardkujacker> @IronPickle Ulysses
[3:02:19] <natebud> grease gun boys
[3:02:21] <+u_should_feel_bad> Raul is my favorite companion
[3:02:21] <TheChampionofBoxes> Pat who is your favorite companion?
[3:02:22] <%fFailureatlife> yoink
[3:02:23] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat Vipers are a lot cooler than they look. They worship a giant snake and make sacrifices to it so they can end the world.
[3:02:24] <ScreamingMeat> Grease Gun for the win
[3:02:26] <+InugamiTheHound> grease gun
[3:02:27] <+Kriptin> Oh you got the FO4 menu thingy
[3:02:30] <Admiral_PopnFresh> M3 Grease Gun PogChamp
[3:02:31] <+Kriptin> that's neat.
[3:02:32] <jobbedbone> did you add the NTR mod?
[3:02:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> "They will look to us and cry "Save us!" and I will whisper "Tunnel Snakes Rule."
[3:02:36] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is super right
[3:02:37] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat did you already find cass at the outpost?
[3:02:39] <+kiiiirsten> ex pee
[3:02:39] <arcaderabbit48> I love the submachine gun and minigun but I feel like they eat through ammo far too quickly
[3:02:40] <TheEnablerr> true
[3:02:44] <%snow_bush> But you can get it now! Through pointless violence!
[3:02:45] <alrobot2014> pat is extremely right
[3:02:46] <+Aetropos> yeah with respawning enemies
[3:02:46] <+AtlasMcCoy> Should get a mod that deletes the level cap
[3:02:49] <gerahwar> Is Pat playing with mods?
[3:02:49] <KeystoneA1> I download an XP dampening mod because of that
[3:02:53] <dekkitout> its only 50
[3:02:53] <%OwlLightningMage> You get so much Exp in this game if you just do most of the things
[3:02:54] <KeystoneA1> Makes it more fun
[3:02:55] <Cthulos> it's no scorpion death god religion
[3:02:56] <ScreamingMeat> Didn't used to be but the DLC changed that
[3:02:58] <%Agami23> theres also way more caps in the game then needed to cap
[3:03:00] <$Niney_Who> Fuck up these Jabronies
[3:03:01] <%ahegotrigger> I mean if you have lessons learned it is
[3:03:02] <godsabove> I usually hit cap before finishing the last dlc
[3:03:05] <ape_hawk> oh boy, time for the fuccboi brigade
[3:03:07] <Gruhunchously> JSawyer significantly reduces XP gain to prevent that
[3:03:09] <a_mad_dragon> not using a level cap remval mod Kappa
[3:03:10] <GyroBrando> wheres boone hes cool and big and strong and cool
[3:03:14] <+AtlasMcCoy> F
[3:03:15] <ScreamingMeat> Shoot his dick
[3:03:15] <TheEnablerr> R U N
[3:03:15] <+Kriptin> Getting skilled so you get that minus 10% Oh yeah
[3:03:16] <$Niney_Who> >Shotgun on Armored enemies LUL
[3:03:16] <%SirChronocide> uh oh, you're fucked now, Pat .XD
[3:03:18] <natebud> Somehow avoided all the mines
[3:03:19] <+AFoolishPaper> F
[3:03:20] <+CuttleCrow> centurions PogChamp
[3:03:21] <+u_should_feel_bad> No AP?
[3:03:23] <%crimsonharvest> lookit that armor cant even break through
[3:03:25] <%ahegotrigger> well youre fucked
[3:03:26] <orcus12> The Caesar has marked you for death and the Legion obeys, ready yourself for battle.
[3:03:28] <jobbedbone> why would an assassin be in full plate armor?
[3:03:29] <%Too_Much_Nukie> BOY! Sure would be nice to have energy weapons!
[3:03:32] <+kiiiirsten> Sexy squat
[3:03:34] <%Too_Much_Nukie> Or Armor Piercing Rounds!
[3:03:37] <%Too_Much_Nukie> TOO BAD.
[3:03:39] <%Too_Much_Nukie> CRAFTING.
[3:03:43] <Gruhunchously> This is a bug where the Legionaries you encounter at low level are super powerful
[3:03:43] <+augurgewalt> these guys are why you don't ill furry man, they are super tough early game
[3:03:50] <%ahegotrigger> holy shit
[3:03:50] <%Agami23> have you ever done a melee fallout build?
[3:03:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> RETRIBUTION
[3:03:53] <spawnzombie> Yeah I personally like removing level cap but Iwouldnt recommend it unless you just want something fresh
[3:03:55] <%ahegotrigger> youre really strong
[3:03:55] <$Niney_Who> If only you had Energy Weapons or AP rounds
[3:03:57] <TheChampionofBoxes> I love that gun but that circle sight looks terrible
[3:03:57] <%jaggiesama> Upskirt
[3:03:57] <ScreamingMeat> One benefit to pissing of the Legion is that the ambush parties have really good gear on them
[3:03:58] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> If you can survive tho, ya got some sweet loot to keep or sell
[3:03:59] <alrobot2014> are you sure its a bug?
[3:04:01] <$Niney_Who> Or Shotgun Surgeon
[3:04:02] <+kiiiirsten> Go get fucking BOONE
[3:04:06] <+VVardy> Is there a reason Pat doesn't play with M+KB for new vegas?
[3:04:08] <Gruhunchously> But, you have ED-E with you so fuck everything.
[3:04:11] <%furiousfurioso> It's Caesars Legion! lionSalt
[3:04:13] <depressedpepega> Oh no its free loot delivery service
[3:04:14] <KeystoneA1> Oh he's got a hunting rifle
[3:04:15] <%TheSpiritof2277> Melee in this is stupid strong, especially with anything that ignores DT
[3:04:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> right in the noodle
[3:04:20] <rockworm> this game looks so good!
[3:04:20] <alrobot2014> @VVardy i'd assume its the gout
[3:04:21] <orcus12> Shocked they dont have Marksmen Rifles and Lances
[3:04:25] <+kiiiirsten> Wow this guy has dick armor AND knee armor
[3:04:25] <%ahegotrigger> heal
[3:04:27] <zerocruz> Oh boy
[3:04:27] <+u_should_feel_bad> When is face blasting not the answer? NEVER
[3:04:28] <Gruhunchously> Hey, Stimpacks are fun
[3:04:29] <5xldragonshirt> Nice playing! good use of vats
[3:04:30] <%crimsonharvest> @AngriestPat if you want a cheap way to bust enemy armor, get shotgun surgeon
[3:04:31] <+VVardy> Makes sense
[3:04:31] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat just hit him with the ripper
[3:04:32] <KeystoneA1> He's got a hunting rifle, that's super good
[3:04:32] <%Nobrev> TAKE HIS HAT
[3:04:33] <+Kriptin> I can't see the health it's making me nervous.
[3:04:35] <machshop> wow what a good assassin
[3:04:35] <+augurgewalt> Pat is a contrarian at heart, so he is required to play each game with the least optimal control method
[3:04:35] <jobbedbone> get the vegas showgirl hat
[3:04:39] <CastellanVon> Need a bigger gun
[3:04:45] <jaycds> vats is gay
[3:04:49] <spectral_mad_doctor> Hunting Rifle is moderate at best.
[3:04:50] <+kiiiirsten> I love how you both went "hold up I gotta reload" at the same time
[3:04:52] <%SuperSonichu> @AngriestPat the legion kill teams spawn at that abandoned gas station on the way to nipton and travel outwards into the world until they find you
[3:04:54] <ScreamingMeat> Need a Trail Carbine or Brush Gun RIGHT NOW? Shoot Vulpes in the face
[3:04:57] <Gruhunchously> That was satisfying.
[3:04:58] <+AtlasMcCoy> Would this fancy metal armor actually do anything against bullets?
[3:05:01] <%ahegotrigger> ripper ignores armor in this game
[3:05:01] <%crimsonharvest> that THREE ZERO EIGHT
[3:05:09] <$Niney_Who> Hunting Rifle > Cowboy Repeater
[3:05:11] <+Mr_Initials> I think he sold the ripper
[3:05:12] <%Nobrev> wear his hat wear his hat wear his hat
[3:05:12] <%deathbytincan> Bongo Bongo Bongo
[3:05:15] <%ahegotrigger> and take your prizes
[3:05:18] <+InugamiTheHound> trail carbine is really good in this game
[3:05:20] <Shastafield> yeah he sold it
[3:05:23] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat Do not sell that hunting rifle. Start maining with it.
[3:05:24] <LightningLynx89> Booo. Pat the Coward, hindering the true heroes.
[3:05:25] <+Kriptin> Well probably not Atlas but neither would leather or most armour that isn't combat armour.
[3:05:26] <zaptar13> @atlasmccoy no
[3:05:26] <DracaenaLeaf> All that in a pile of whatever?
[3:05:26] <natebud> THE MAGNUM LIVES
[3:05:27] <%crimsonharvest> that super sledge is worth dollar
[3:05:27] <zerocruz> Hunting rifle is the fucking best
[3:05:27] <+augurgewalt> that's some good armor, too bad everyone will shoot you for wearing it
[3:05:31] <spectral_mad_doctor> Well yeah, plus the peep sight on the repeater SUCKS.
[3:05:33] <%fFailureatlife> the hunting rifle is my favorite
[3:05:36] <%ahegotrigger> the centurian armor is cool

[3:14:49] <%jiin6> Throwing spears were broken

[3:15:37] <MaverickHaunter> @Fallout48 well, techincally speaking even if you throw it, it is not a throwing spear since it doesn't throws anything

[3:17:45] <alcors_wisdom> no if you defend the ranger base they'll fuck off

[3:20:20] <%Finalknightmare> That bridge up ahead has traders to sell your stuff to
[3:20:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> @AngriestPat Why aren't you making ED-E carry your loot for you?
[3:20:20] <zafooru> EdE is a moving box
[3:20:21] <%PenmanLupine> repair the armors to sell them for more caps
[3:20:22] <natebud> Pat is really tempted to sell all that stuff and wait another day
[3:20:25] <DarkZoren> when you get the legion's affinity reset you can try to pal around long enough to get access to their hide out for the lucky shades.
[3:20:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat HATES using game mechanics

[3:22:46] <+ogrest> maybe if younglings didn't want to be killed they wouldn't fucking stand there like dumbasses while someone murders them
[3:22:47] <kinrobo> nobody cares about that
[3:22:49] <+u_should_feel_bad> Letting all that meat go to waste
[3:22:53] <natebud> trading post ahead

[3:23:15] <+CuttleCrow> no i meant the dead trader
[3:23:15] <%jiin6> HE WASTES the MEAT
[3:23:16] <+ogrest> did you think that maybe if god wanted those younglings to live, he wouldn't have put them in front of anakin while he had a lightsaber in his hand?
[3:23:17] <TheEnablerr> or not
[3:23:18] <Gruhunchously> If you were worried about getting ambushed again you could just hook up with a caravan and use them as meat shields.
[3:23:21] <$Niney_Who> Here's where the Cleaver is

[3:25:16] <+CuttleCrow> WHY
[3:25:16] <DarkZoren> the true reason that Ulysses hates Pat is that he stole his cleaver and book.

[3:25:58] <%sparrrow_> pack mule
[3:25:59] <+CuttleCrow> It's your personal BANK
[3:26:00] <sparkboy777> @AngriestPat just give him things youre gunna sell.
[3:26:00] <%Jp3g95> Yes then ED-E will use the Chopper Kappa
[3:26:03] <natebud> give him your busted armor
[3:26:04] <bjd5955> why the shovel
[3:26:06] <%CwutGaming> !uptime
[3:26:07] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 26m.
[3:26:08] <+SWFanatic> choppa choppa your pee pee
[3:26:09] <$Niney_Who> Gooood pat
[3:26:12] <Gruhunchously> We're coming up to Boone, so I assume he'll be next.
[3:26:15] <Ran196> he does have a weight limit
[3:26:16] <+Aetropos> he has a limit too
[3:26:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he has a limit
[3:26:16] <nobody12349> He has a limit
[3:26:19] <$Niney_Who> He has a carry weight of... something.
[3:26:19] <+ogrest> I like the fake plastic trees version of Ed-E better tbh
[3:26:19] <outis94> all but faction armor
[3:26:19] <%sparrrow_> He stores it in the same place as Cammy in SFV Kappa
[3:26:20] <%Too_Much_Nukie> He won't use any of it because he's a robot.
[3:26:20] <corepercentlives> forget goes up ede ass goes down
[3:26:22] <raminnoodle420> Give him the caps thats a good idea
[3:26:23] <+CuttleCrow> yes Pat, ED-E is basically a pack mule
[3:26:23] <%jiin6> he has a limit
[3:26:23] <$Niney_Who> But it's limited
[3:26:23] <%Skeletorexplains> Ed-E is gonna scam you bud
[3:26:24] <+augurgewalt> chopper is silly strong, i don't like the lack of range though
[3:26:25] <rockworm> i always use my companion as a pack mule it seems like the most useful thing they do lol
[3:26:26] <+ogrest> sex robot > eyebot
[3:26:27] <Gruhunchously> ED-E and Boone is the death combo
[3:26:29] <RiverBirch> Choppin that meat
[3:26:30] <%FunTruker> @AngriestPat There are two merchants near you on the broken bridge
[3:26:35] <%Skeletorexplains> hes gonna sell all that crap for jawbreakers!
[3:26:36] <nobody12349> He can't carry faction armor
[3:26:38] <%Jp3g95> It tells you if ED-E is at capacity, yeah?
[3:26:47] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat can’t go past his weaight limit and he can’t carry the Legion armor
[3:26:47] <spiegspikel> I need help. Garou is $6 right now on PSN, but I’m told the netcode is pretty awful. Anybody here able to confirm or deny this?
[3:26:47] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat Do you know about the exploit to duplicate Boone's beret?
[3:26:48] <alexandrecau> you can have sex with an eyebot
[3:26:52] <+u_should_feel_bad> What if EDE flew lower the more stuff the carried?
[3:26:53] <%jiin6> ED will tell you
[3:26:54] <%sparrrow_> That bridge just gave me a flashback to that Vampire quest in Fallout 3, that quest was so fucking cool
[3:26:58] <RiverBirch> Wackin and mackin and smackin.
[3:27:00] <$Niney_Who> There's probably a Mod for that
[3:27:02] <sparkboy777> cant you pick up veronica here?
[3:27:02] <%lewdskeletor13> They have the high ground!! apatWhat
[3:27:03] <+Spikyshrike> There's prob a mod for that
[3:27:03] <spectral_mad_doctor> DONT DUMP CASES
[3:27:09] <laguerrilha> @AngriestPat he drops group based armor like Legion and NCR armor
[3:27:10] <%sparrrow_> probably a mod for that
[3:27:11] <+u_should_feel_bad> I remember this part
[3:27:13] <alrobot2014> he doesn't craft anyway
[3:27:14] <raminnoodle420> There might be a mod for that
[3:27:17] <%FrostMass22> He's chopping that swelling meat
[3:27:19] <AirlineFood74> @spectral_mad_doctor he doesn'T care for the crafting
[3:27:20] <%OwlLightningMage> @spectral_mad_doctor Pat doesn't make ammo
[3:27:22] <%Dragonfang1337> now KILL them
[3:27:26] <+ogrest> @alexandrecau it's just not the same as turning off a robot then having sex with it after sitting it in an ice water bath for a while though, usually I'd have to go to the gomorrah's back room for that kind of service
[3:27:27] <+CuttleCrow> so Pat, GET THIS: you have two companions right? you make one your pack mule for selling (ED-E) and one for other shit
[3:27:28] <TheEnablerr> @sparkboy777 that's after Novac
[3:27:29] <nobody12349> Wait why can EDE carry faction armor?
[3:27:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh no 5 wasted seconds
[3:27:33] <%lewdskeletor13> MURDER
[3:27:33] <%joylent_blue> loot whoever dies in the ambush
[3:27:36] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat But Pat, if you keep cases, you could kill Legion with their own stupid coins
[3:27:38] <spectral_mad_doctor> @AngriestPat But Why though?
[3:27:38] <%jiin6> Hey there...need anything?
[3:27:38] <+Aetropos> cuz he cant wear it
[3:27:39] <alcors_wisdom> honestly sell everything in aid except meds and books
[3:27:41] <+augurgewalt> cases have no weight or value though
[3:27:54] <Gruhunchously> @jiin6 Sure, here's what I got.
[3:27:55] <%OwlLightningMage> @spectral_mad_doctor Pat loves to be wrong LUL
[3:27:56] <%jiin6> Cases have no sell value
[3:27:59] <$Niney_Who> I hope Pat buys That Gun
[3:27:59] <AirlineFood74> @augurgewalt it's pat.
[3:28:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat does what Pat wants
[3:28:08] <spectral_mad_doctor> Exactly why you shouldn't dump then.
[3:28:10] <Grayhammatter> mini nukes though? what the hell?
[3:28:10] <+AncientToco> Pat hate to craft and hates the better ammo types
[3:28:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> NUKES?

[3:30:59] <%lewdskeletor13> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[3:31:01] <DarkZoren> like true rpg
[3:31:05] <corepercentlives> still warm
[3:31:09] <%joylent_blue> @AngriestPat that's a scripted ambush btw, they were there for the merchants, not you
[3:31:09] <TheEnablerr> "Here's your friends clothes now pay me"
[3:31:10] <+MisterCrimson> "Here let me sell you this shit I picked up off your dead bodyguard"
[3:31:14] <+augurgewalt> howdy
[3:31:16] <Gruhunchously> Well, the Gun Runners do have factories.
[3:31:22] <%lewdskeletor13> @sparrrow_ There are factories, back in the NCR
[3:31:24] <+MrWrann> "hey you want to buy the armor that the guy you hired was wearing"
[3:31:28] <+Kriptin> Handloading tools @sparrrow_
[3:31:30] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hero pat
[3:31:31] <AirlineFood74> @AngriestPat If you pick up Boone's beret from the person he snipes in his quest you'll duplicate it when you talk to him, meaning you'll both have sick-ass berets
[3:31:33] <%sparrrow_> DRAGOON BUILD
[3:31:35] <TranquilTurnip> Those guys and the merchants are alwasys here
[3:31:37] <spectral_mad_doctor> @sparrrow_ Yeah, you don't factory. You just need a reload bench. People do it all the time.
[3:31:37] <+ogrest> @sparrrow_ absolutely, primitive ones usually, but if you can find a c&c machine and some reloading equipment you're good to go
[3:31:43] <+kiiiirsten> Heal your leg you heathen
[3:31:44] <+augurgewalt> could have repaired that sledge later and sold it for big money
[3:31:44] <alrobot2014> the onees on the way out of novac will be out for you
[3:31:53] <%TheDude8D> murder the merchants
[3:31:58] <Meekest> Legion crucifies people, act like jackasses, destroy towns, rob merchants, and people still wanna join em for some reason
[3:32:04] <%Jp3g95> apatBig money
[3:32:06] <saberknight_> romans are cool
[3:32:07] <$Niney_Who> Yeah sleep in Ulysses' bed
[3:32:09] <$Niney_Who> that'll show him
[3:32:13] <+augurgewalt> @Meekest but order though
[3:32:14] <+AtlasMcCoy> Just sleep the shattered bones away
[3:32:22] <raminnoodle420> Legionairres, they just wanna make more jesus's
[3:32:25] <+ogrest> @sparrrow_ helll, you give me a rubber band, a metal pipe, a needle and some shotgun shells and I can make you a shotgun RIGHT NOW
[3:32:27] <spectral_mad_doctor> @Meekest People don't have a choice; their tribes got conquered.
[3:32:27] <DarkZoren> more reason for Ulysses to hate Pat
[3:32:27] <LightningLynx89> Man how come the Legion are just the coolest and strongest
[3:32:35] <+MisterCrimson> @Meekest don't forget the slavery and rape
[3:32:39] <+CuttleCrow> KILL
[3:32:42] <natebud> Pat peed in Ulysses bed
[3:32:44] <%lewdskeletor13> The Legion suck all the dicks
[3:32:46] <%Jp3g95> Kill em all PAtrick
[3:32:46] <thelonechris> You can take them
[3:32:55] <+Exyoh> Some people are just way into brute force authoritarianism. And hats.
[3:32:56] <indig0bird> That's something I like about the HC mode
[3:32:56] <%ahegotrigger> dont shoot those ones
[3:32:58] <DarkZoren> strongest = dumbass cosplayers
[3:32:58] <LightningLynx89> @lewdskeletor13 The Legion has no time for modern moralities
[3:32:58] <+InugamiTheHound> i need to replay new vegas and play the dlc. I heard dead money dlc is super bad
[3:33:03] <laguerrilha> I was a moron and tried to make a Legion run while having a female character LUL
[3:33:03] <indig0bird> You have to fix your bones with doctor bags
[3:33:05] <wolf_hurricane> dead money is great
[3:33:05] <+augurgewalt> the real reason Ulysses hates courier six is because they slept in his bed
[3:33:05] <troytaco> bones just all naturally mending themselves sideways and your character just gets more deformed over time
[3:33:05] <diegobandzz> use the power of gun
[3:33:06] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @airlinefood74 no, it’s not duping. You’re the one who puts it on to signal and he lets you keep it so you can take advantage of the beret’s effects...plus he has a spare.
[3:33:08] <wolf_hurricane> shut up
[3:33:09] <%sparrrow_> Crucifixion is one of the most fucked up things people have ever come up with
[3:33:10] <%umbypokochan> i will continue to point out that one of the slaves was mean to my dog so fuck em
[3:33:11] <+Aetropos> wtf thats the best town in the game
[3:33:15] <Astaroth130> anyone know which faction hes going with?
[3:33:18] <+Spikyshrike> Just blitz Lonesome Road Kappa
[3:33:19] <%gespenst25> @sparrrow_ simple fire arms like pipe rifles or zip guns yeah. but at this point in history they've rebuilt the factories...
[3:33:21] <%CerberusDriver> dead money
[3:33:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @InugamiTheHound Dead Money is you either love it or you hate it
[3:33:23] <%ahegotrigger> wait for boone to do booted
[3:33:26] <Calindoor> are you also going to do all the dlc for this as well
[3:33:28] <TheEnablerr> Fuckin' searchlight
[3:33:30] <+ogrest> @Exyoh you say that like it's a bad thing, but when you need to get shit done, democracy isn't always the answer, just sayin
[3:33:33] <wolf_hurricane> HOUSE OR RIOT
[3:33:33] <%ahegotrigger> nah get boone first
[3:33:34] <+kiiiirsten> Go get Boone you fuckoducko
[3:33:34] <%Dragonfang1337> TEAM MYSELF
[3:33:35] <%TheDude8D> yourself

[3:36:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @alcors_wisdom oh okay. I don't usually use the hunting rifle
[3:36:40] <DarkZoren> makes it so you can use the cosshairs instead of ironsights
[3:36:40] <rockworm> remember anything bad about this game is 100% Bathesda's fault and Obsidian can do no wrong ever
[3:36:42] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat it use the rng like vats in new vegas iirc
[3:36:49] <DarkZoren> its argubly better for most guns

[3:39:15] <natebud> purified water is worth it
[3:39:18] <DarkZoren> you can change iron sights to crosshairs in the display settings
[3:39:19] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat iirc the aiming is always based on dice rolls but you probably already knew that
[3:39:20] <raminnoodle420> stealing from legionaires is a no no
[3:39:20] <%SiameseSneeze> The Hunting Rifle Sights are literally misaligned, the sights go slightly to the left of where you are aiming
[3:39:20] <%lewdskeletor13> he’ll tell everyone what a bad ass you are
[3:39:21] <+AtlasMcCoy> Lost karma for robbing from the legion guys you just murdered
[3:39:23] <%TheDude8D> Stealing
[3:39:24] <thelonechris> Why would you lose karma for stealing from the Legion?
[3:39:26] <Conky89> A new version of the farmer and the scorpion: With Poweder Gangers as the farmer, and Pat as the scorpion.
[3:39:26] <+Exyoh> Wow, what a baddie you are for stealing from the immoral dead
[3:39:26] <+CuttleCrow> stealing from slavers, that's a paddlin'
[3:39:26] <diegobandzz> get that smh tho
[3:39:27] <%Dragonfang1337> killing isn't losing karma but stealing from them is vineThink

[3:39:30] <alcors_wisdom> pat didnt kill all the escaping hostages therefore tonight hes the biggest losers
[3:39:30] <PinkSocks> they should've removed Karma in NV
[3:39:31] <Ran196> take a nap
[3:39:32] <%Jp3g95> Wait does he lose Boone?
[3:39:32] <$Niney_Who> Stealing from Slavers is bad

[3:39:45] <DarkZoren> smg by campfire
[3:39:48] <+Aetropos> ironsights are more fun tho

[5:16:20] <%KevinsLunchbox> if only you didnt sell those STEALTHBOYS
[5:16:20] <%gespenst25> i didn't think it was possible to get to evil in this game
[5:16:22] <%freightl0rd> i thought boone would fuck off if you didnt quit acting like an asshole?
[5:16:22] <grimnier> It's bad when others do it, but Pat really wants it, so it's ok

[5:17:24] <Jack_Onee_san> @AngriestPat Just unlocked Saturn!
[5:17:24] <KeystoneA1> You can kill Cass if you antagonize her over her dead parents when she criticizes you for being evil
[5:17:26] <drewslo> VATS
[5:17:28] <JittersCaffeine> @AngriestPat either cheat your karma up or go massacre some Fieands. Because she'll instantly leave you if you have low karma
[5:17:29] <dekkitout> just kill some ghouls and powder gangers, and itl be fiiine
[5:17:30] <randomp141> @AngriestPat it's cloaked pat.
[5:17:37] <%sparrrow_> LUL
[5:17:39] <Conky89> You could be evil as crap for stealing, yet be benevolent to numerous factions in the game.
[5:17:40] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat if you start out as good she'll travel with you, but as you turn evil she forces a dialogue that releases her from your service

[5:25:05] <rossnwolf> @sparrrow_ Gross
[5:25:07] <Conky89> Boone was so freaking broken when this game was first released. His stats were bugged and he basically was in god mode.
[5:25:07] <+dougrayman> that looks like a cod animation
[5:25:09] <%deviljhojho94> use your sick NCR skills
[5:25:10] <vanagandr_hnd> their pathing isnt the greatest
[5:25:10] <+Kravedarknesss> of course pat shoots when it runs away
[5:25:12] <+SiegeJay> Is it a bit ironic that the guy who is known for shouting a lot has CAPSLOCK restrictions?
[5:25:12] <%spacekataz18> My waifle
[5:25:13] <%sparrrow_> Also a shower is only supposed to last like 3 minutes apparently
[5:25:14] <%mostundesired> Good job Boone

[5:26:44] <%cervidaequus> yes, big kills
[5:26:45] <nogameunplayed> "why am I bothering to walk" - reason #1 why open world games should limit fast travel
[5:26:45] <JittersCaffeine> Don't go into Vault 3. Save them for the Khan quest lines

[5:26:48] <%TheSpiritof2277> Or a bunch of ghouls, yeah
[5:26:48] <young_sn0w> @dirtydeedsdundirtcheap yep, not a big fan of all those mods that add features and make the game completely different

[5:31:05] <Estuko> @AngriestPat god I hope this isn't some dream that just skips through a lifetime only for you to wake up to your alarm clock to go to your job at retail
[5:31:06] <%CrimsonCore90> 1500 dollars for a reacharound
[5:31:08] <Dingo_Eejit> Where da Woolie at?
[5:31:08] <chrisboba8> try to find something laid back without costumer interactions whatsoever
[5:31:12] <Magir0ck> woolieGASM woolieGASM
[5:31:13] <%Skrypto> Theres always a number
[5:31:14] <derap41> $10,000 or the mystery box
[5:31:17] <JittersCaffeine> If you bump speech, you don't really NEED charisma
[5:31:20] <%OwlLightningMage> Charisma is meh in all the new games
[5:31:24] <DancingBasturd> Charisma is pretty worthless. Just dump points in Speech
[5:31:28] <derap41> Charisma is pointless
[5:31:30] <%Too_Much_Nukie> 1 Charisma is the ideal way to go.
[5:31:37] <FracturedImage> CHA is pointless
[5:31:43] <+SWFanatic> good night everybody, me done
[5:31:46] <+atlasbot1> CHA CHA CHA
[5:31:47] <%TheSpiritof2277> Charisma is a dumpster stat
[5:31:49] <%OwlLightningMage> It's never gonna be stronger than when it gave you more part members
[5:31:52] <%deviljhojho94> BETTER CRITS IS A MUST
[5:31:52] <derap41> its bad
[5:31:53] <%deviljhojho94> A MUST
[5:31:59] <+atlasbot1> WOollie
[5:31:59] <JittersCaffeine> Charisma exists to give you a jump start on barter and speech
[5:32:00] <Laicuss> CHA CHA SLIDE
[5:32:01] <+JenovasPuppet> COWARD
[5:32:02] <lich995> Good move
[5:32:02] <%SaltyDongs> CHA LA
[5:32:05] <Gruhunchously> But Muh Better Criticals!
[5:32:13] <%cervidaequus> big speech
[5:32:14] <AlasterAngelo> Charisma is pointless if you're a nerd who can't look people in the eye when you talk to them
[5:32:28] <a_mad_dragon> at least they're not the leafs
[5:32:29] <JittersCaffeine> But it also increases your Companions' hidden "nerve" stat
[5:32:34] <JohnathanSanta> monkey nuts
[5:32:36] <+atlasbot1> I miss woolie

[5:35:15] <%Typhaeon> TRUTH
[5:35:15] <DancingBasturd> What about OUTER WORLDS
[5:35:15] <MUhockey95> fair as fuck
[5:35:17] <Gruhunchously> Sad but true
[5:35:18] <+Kravedarknesss> i would agree
[5:35:18] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout4 WASN'T THAAAAT BAD
[5:35:19] <+bonelord> Way too true.
[5:35:19] <%MahoganyVince> We gotta get the Fallout Battle Royale first
[5:35:20] <madogod> fallout 4 was pretty good imo. fight me
[5:35:20] <%jiin6> Totally Give up on Bethesda
[5:35:21] <%OwlLightningMage> I honestly want them to sell the rights to someone else
[5:35:23] <a_mad_dragon> we need a van buren revival
[5:35:25] <nobody12349> lT'S FUCK YOU JANUARY
[5:35:25] <Grayhammatter> sad and true
[5:35:26] <%TheSpiritof2277> People hated Jesus for he spoke the truth
[5:35:27] <%Das_Bass> agree 100% with pat
[5:35:29] <TootPirate> I'm scared for Elder Scrolls
[5:35:30] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 4 was bad
[5:35:32] <%PenmanLupine> Fallout 4 is fine, people are just weak
[5:35:34] <%deviljhojho94> I cant fight the mentally handicapped LUL
[5:35:35] <%OwlLightningMage> 76 is a joke
[5:35:35] <rockworm> the circlejerking is strong here
[5:35:35] <%Skrypto> Pat Tired
[5:35:36] <MUhockey95> is it bad i enjoy 76...
[5:35:38] <+NiktenKing> I only like Fallout 4 cause CALLADOOTYDAWG
[5:35:41] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, in terms of writing yes. F4 isn't really the same game.
[5:35:44] <%Typhaeon> Fallout 4 was tedious
[5:35:46] <Calek> someone sided with the Enclave? for shame
[5:35:48] <$awsomesaucekirby> Murica
[5:35:54] <%mister___doctor> "Pat heres money, will you validate my opinions for me"
[5:35:55] <%jiin6> Enclave ew
[5:35:55] <DancingBasturd> Enclave suck but the Enclave Remnants are the shit
[5:35:58] <+SuichiTanaka> The gunplay in 4 was way better though, so it has some merit.
[5:36:00] <valachi> @DancingBasturd Outer Worlds is probably gonna be bad too. Pillars of Eternity bombed and everyone that made New Vegas good is gone now.
[5:36:04] <MUhockey95> 3 is still the best imo
[5:36:04] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 4 has so much wasted potential.
[5:36:05] <TalisKanju> When is Pat next streaming?
[5:36:05] <%Chatterbox1991> ayyyyyy Lynx
[5:36:06] <+Puppa_Warpig> !uptime
[5:36:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 36m.
[5:36:07] <%MahoganyVince> I bought 76 when it went on deep sale a couple weeks after it came out, player for a couple hours and DRASTICALLY lost interest
[5:36:08] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is super right
[5:36:08] <%PenmanLupine> most people that complain about fallout 4 never even played it.
[5:36:10] <+Aetropos> pat saying caesar correctly!
[5:36:11] <%lucidrush> Inb4 bethesda rereleases NV on current consoles as misguided damage control
[5:36:11] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat 4's implamentation of Power Armor, assuming you don't just meta game the shit out of fusion cores, is fun. It makes power armor actually feel dangerous to unarmored players
[5:36:12] <%deviljhojho94> settlements are shit
[5:36:12] <chrisboba8> OUTER WORLDSS!!!
[5:36:15] <+Kravedarknesss> @rockworm just cause people dont like a game doesnt mean it's a circlejerk
[5:36:16] <%SiameseSneeze> I like Fallout 4... with tons of mods
[5:36:18] <%OwlLightningMage> There's also nothing to find
[5:36:20] <%TheyCallMeVawn> Im super not a fan of 4s voiced main character and the way the dialogue works
[5:36:20] <rockworm> its so easy to ignore the building and settlements
[5:36:26] <%Chatterbox1991> @LightningLinx AVE CAESAR
[5:36:29] <DancingBasturd> @valachi You're probably right. I'm just hoping it gets the NV treatment and gets better with age.
[5:36:34] <massive_laser_zapper> bethesda's been slipping since oblivion, & the cracks were visible even in oblivion
[5:36:35] <%ElenaManetta> Fallout 4's locations and characters were still fun even if your quest log would never stop with settlement demands.
[5:36:36] <valachi> Settlements were just a cheap excuse for Bethesda to not make any interesting locations.
[5:36:37] <%deviljhojho94> voiced main character and settlements kileld it
[5:36:37] <%Skrypto> I liked the Landscape, but the story and settlements were meh
[5:36:39] <KangarooCyborg> Settlements are a nightmarish slog of micromanagement that plagues the entire experience
[5:36:43] <+Puppa_Warpig> I wish they kept the ammo construction from new vegas
[5:36:46] <Estuko> I became too strong regardless of the game's difficulty and my build
[5:36:50] <+Lavanio> 3 did that too
[5:36:53] <vollian> bethesda's level scaling is a big pile of dog shit
[5:36:54] <%Typhaeon> Bethesda not learning their lesson from OBLIVION about enemy scaling
[5:36:56] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yep fuck games that lvl with you
[5:37:00] <Calek> the fact that Fallout 4 gave you power armour and made you fight a deathclaw at the very start sucked the wind out its sails for me
[5:37:01] <%OwlLightningMage> It also has no real side quests and it's all combat
[5:37:03] <JittersCaffeine> I was really annoyed that the unlocking and hacking perks were level locked.
[5:37:05] <Mr_Strut> Level scaling is the worst
[5:37:10] <rockworm> No everyone agreeing that the entire franchise is a lost cause because you don't like the games is circlejerking
[5:37:10] <valachi> Pipe Weapons are garbage and people that thought they were a good idea are dumb.
[5:37:17] <+Zerodyne90> hope they'll finally get rid of it
[5:37:19] <MUhockey95> the special silenced handgun in 4 was the best
[5:37:20] <+Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat what do you think about ff14 shadowbringers?
[5:37:23] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat thats an overlook on that lving up enemies system
[5:37:26] <+ChaosVulpes> Yeah, Oblivion and it's fucking bandits all starting to wear Glass and Deadric armor. Where the fuck did those bandits get that shit!?!
[5:37:27] <Gruhunchously> I'll never understand the logic behind having EVERYTHING level up along side you.
[5:37:28] <%Rngiddion> man I sure love shooting DLC enemies in the head with a autoshoty 50 times to kill them
[5:37:29] <knoxxsgold> Late game causes a thing where you have to use only the overpowered legendary weapons
[5:37:29] <Grayhammatter> basically
[5:37:30] <%OwlLightningMage> There's no reason to explore in that game and your choices don't matter
[5:37:33] <Estuko> @valachi they look like shit too
[5:37:33] <ScreamingMeat> Goddamn shitty internet!
[5:37:36] <crow_king_> Game World is well designed, but everything besides the companions are super yikes
[5:37:39] <+NiktenKing> The Legendary system was fucked
[5:37:40] <AlasterAngelo> wait are there people that actually like Fallout 76
[5:37:42] <$Magir0ck> cheer200 loved the stream, ty pat
[5:37:44] <%Typhaeon> The franchise will remain a lost cause as long as it's Bethesda's property
[5:37:45] <JittersCaffeine> I like being able to start with 50 Lockpicking or whatever at level 1 in New Vegas
[5:37:49] <Canti58> Hey Pat, do you have a countdown to the release of RE2 on your refrigerator like me an any other normal person should or are you a fake RE fan?
[5:37:49] <DancingBasturd> And somehow Skyrim
[5:37:51] <%deviljhojho94> yeah that shit was dumn
[5:37:52] <+NiktenKing> Random Legendary Alpha Deathclaw
[5:37:52] <valachi> @Estuko They look so fucking bad holy shit
[5:37:53] <madogod> okay pat whatever you say
[5:37:53] <ape_hawk> they really limited the perk selection that way
[5:37:53] <%crimsonharvest> Trust Bethesda to do as little work as possible
[5:37:54] <+SuichiTanaka> and Skyrim's perk tree is AWFUL
[5:37:54] <%ElenaManetta> Just give me Fallout 4's world and characters with NV engine
[5:37:57] <nina9669> i hate Bethesdas leveling system
[5:37:57] <laguerrilha> Level scaling should degrade after a while. Otherwise you will never be better or fell accomplished
[5:38:04] <Calek> ending the game with 10 in all SPECIAL makes it a bit lame too
[5:38:04] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer200 was an enclave remnant, the GM gave him a pet deathclaw due to all the other players metagaming him, and the fluff about them and the enclave and he teamed up with the legion and a vault dweller. really good story. i think neckbeardia did a greentext read of it
[5:38:05] <%Rngiddion> Gotta dumb down these increasingly dumbed down rpgs
[5:38:07] <%Centrilion> I would love a new fallout that is in the style of 1 and 2
[5:38:07] <Estuko> @valachi there was no way I'd ever use one just because of how awful they looked.
[5:38:08] <JittersCaffeine> There's an optimal path in the Fallout 4 leveling tree and that's just lame
[5:38:08] <%lucidrush> Fallout needs a new team, engine, and a few years out of the spotlight

[5:38:23] <KangarooCyborg> optimal fallout 4 was spam criticals with 10 luck

[5:38:32] <+A_Ninja_Who_Games> Hey Pat happy to finally make it to one of your streams! I've been busy with my first semester of college but the Warframe videos really helped me make it through especially since you are a fellow Inaros main!
[5:38:33] <rockworm> Its funny because the franchise wouldn't have existed past the original games without Bathesda... I guess that would have been for the best

[5:39:04] <%Skrypto> My Pleasure ^^
[5:39:05] <%OwlLightningMage> There's so little real choices in Fallout 4. It feels more like an Ubisoft game than anything else

[5:41:19] <DracaenaLeaf> If Paige only orders the burger with only the condiments, wouldn't that be meatloaf?
[5:41:26] <a_mad_dragon> niblets + mashed potatoes = god tier

[5:44:55] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer200 fine, i will spoil it, everyone close your ear holes. you fight a god, a dark god, free the hands, and you get to play AS Master Hand. and the rathalos fight is quite in depth, head ant tail damage, and 2 items drop that can be used as flash pods and pitfall traps. it's fuckin gold
[5:44:56] <%TheMattman1313> I mean I was 2 when the Dreamcast came out. My younger sister, who's now in college, was born over a year AFTER it.
