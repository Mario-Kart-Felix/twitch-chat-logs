[0:05:23] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> There's actually a shocking lack of people dying in this yakuza game.
[0:05:45] <%krispen_wa> Because Ichiban is a Hero of Justice who will save everyone
[0:05:51] <kingcosmicthecosmicking> to be honest, I like Ichiban more that Kiryu, not that I disliked Kiryu, I think he's cool
[0:05:58] <kingcosmicthecosmicking> but I'm a sucker for underdogs
[0:05:59] <mortificent> there hasn't been a big WIPEOUT in the series since 1, iirc
[0:06:09] <%MonsterEnvy> Chee500 So Pat with the end of the game approaching and only Aoki, Ishioda and Sawashiro left as notable villains (Kume does not count) any theories on how things will go.
[0:06:12] <%krispen_wa> Yakuza 1 is so fucking depressing
[0:06:12] <Hellarussian> Ichiban has the talk no jutsu
[0:06:15] <%honeyman18> Oh yeah, didnt he just get past the old man getting shot and now Ichis depressed?
[0:06:25] <%krispen_wa> Kume is the REAL villain

[0:07:18] <%eyezehuhh> psaBlind_BW
[0:07:19] <Aiden_Sylas_Storm> I think the reason Kasuga is better then kiryu is because fighting everyone is always Kiryu's one and only plan, while Kasuga only fights everyone because they force him to.

[0:24:57] <Sulfur_Boride> @PatStaresAt So is Ichiban more like Kiryu when it came to taking the fall for murder, since Ichiban in reality technically took the fall for someone he considered a friend?
[0:24:58] <Blank9> if yakuza 7 had an intro, it would show majima and kiryu in it for sure
[0:24:59] <Mahbonk> yeah and more Item packs
[0:25:00] <%mike2hands> Mabuchi's theme is the best
[0:25:00] <%DashXero> How are they supposed to make us believe that Kasuga and his merry band of chucklefucks can even muss Kiryu's hair?!

[0:37:33] <skyentombment> I fucking LOVE how that was like "Hey, we're making this shit!" "WHAT" "nvm, I'm making nothing of the sort"}
[0:37:34] <+Seitine> Goddamn I want a puppy.

[0:37:49] <mortificent> Imagine fighting Amon Kappa
[0:37:55] <%bread_assassin> Zangief's a harsh critic.
[0:37:57] <%TheMattman1313> Jowl WIGGLING
[0:38:01] <+Mendin> Pat you've already ground and completionist'd a lot in this game since it's an RPG, SHOW US THE AMON YOU (formerly) OVERLEVELED BINCH
[0:38:01] <%KineKithZen> Hironoki is the Okie's weeb form
[0:38:03] <acrobaticballerina> Pat, don't you feel weird touching a dog's face and then touching your own face right after with the same unwashed hands?
[0:38:03] <%radda343> he do a blep
[0:38:05] <%fat_burtreynolds> Zangief wants a cyberpunk 2077 samurai cola made by rockstar. Probably the most caustic drink ever invented
[0:38:08] <%Higure_yoru> blep pupper
[0:38:11] <RyeBreadBakery> shake the bag, wiggle the jowl

[0:38:34] <+tehbuu> lil blep Gief, maybe someday he'll bust out a command grab on stream
[0:38:41] <%eyezehuhh> wii U
[0:38:41] <Profmcstevie> The bugs vary from "haha AI break" to "my mission fucking broke, reload a save"
[0:38:43] <$Futurecity10> @neroforte177 still getting made
[0:38:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL

[0:38:59] <+RowenCleric> the ps4 version reminds me of Shadow of Mordor ps3, remember that?
[0:39:03] <%Birdigalore> Cant wait for the Cyberpunk talk on the podcast lmao
[0:39:10] <%jorniev> AAAAAUGH
[0:39:10] <$Futurecity10> Pat why do maps in ff14 suck ass
[0:39:12] <%gnarly_memes_bro> the cop spawn is the one that really does it for me. thats just bad
[0:39:14] <%jorniev> IT HURTS
[0:39:15] <Blank9> cops do that
[0:39:15] <fabo_joyful> he blep
[0:39:17] <huskarl_zap> a cop out
[0:39:18] <bob900000> like real life
[0:39:18] <%aram909> Uh that's just how cops work IRL
[0:39:20] <jetpack_rorschasch> So are they ever going to fix the PS4 version?
[0:39:21] <%jorniev> WHYYYY CD PROJECT
[0:39:22] <Monkeyweed21> thats how cops work IRL
[0:39:22] <%GG_sensay> early access sounds right
[0:39:23] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt u saw Shy's video on the game I assume?
[0:39:23] <nevan_44> like real life!
[0:39:24] <+Mendin> Cops suddenly appear to shoot you in the back of the head? SOUNDS LIKE AMERICA
[0:39:26] <MarvelousMrD> its a shame the story was very enjoyable
[0:39:29] <%radda343> I love the dumb car bugs they're the best
[0:39:30] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Pc is working fine for me
[0:39:30] <+Seitine> How long till ya'll think it's playable and worth it?
[0:39:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS THE BEST LUL
[0:39:32] <+skyheys> Sounds realistic?
[0:39:33] <%jorniev> UHUHUHHUHUUUUU
[0:39:36] <%Grimlockfly> PS4 on PS5 is fine most of the time, it just dies every other 15 minutes
[0:39:38] <%cache_22> Anyone want to take bets on how long the "Cyberpunk is Jank" part of the podcast will be? 40+ minutes
[0:39:41] <%Birdigalore> YEARS OF WORK, MONTHS OF CRUNCH
[0:39:41] <%jorniev> NOOOOOO
[0:39:43] <%OrangeMDT> AI just isn't good in Cyberpunk
[0:39:45] <%SunnyVarietyPack> Oh
[0:39:46] <%Esparsenior> The cop thing is one of the worst parts tbh
[0:39:46] <Profmcstevie> It's a broken design for an open world game outright, forget bugs
[0:39:48] <+Kanrir_> the shareholders did so dirty in releasing the game
[0:39:48] <%jorniev> i cant
[0:39:49] <%tigerfang86> tigerfang86 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! here's another month to say thanks for introducing me to Yakuza and all the big wholesome himbo energy it contains
[0:39:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> My beast of a PC can handle it
[0:39:51] <%KeiganOfAstora> no driving AI
[0:39:52] <NitronStreams> give it at least a year
[0:39:53] <Monkeyweed21> I know cops they can teleport in and out of reality
[0:39:53] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> how can that game have that many issues with that much development time, honest question
[0:39:55] <%SpcOpsBear> Thanks for the 2020Rivalry @tigerfang86
[0:39:58] <bob900000> is the story even good?
[0:39:58] <%DappercatEsquire> as someone that didn't hype it at all, the game is... fine
[0:40:05] <%KeiganOfAstora> I don't think it was originally intended to be open-world
[0:40:14] <Torgue_1> @cache_22 Those are rookie numbers
[0:40:15] <%coreyyotto> like there's a lot of logic bugs, not performance bugs
[0:40:16] <+Seitine> Honestly, good. Gives me time to build a good PC.
[0:40:16] <%tigerfang86> yo nice Bear that's my favorite holiday emote this time 2020Rivalry

[0:40:50] <+GingerStrawhat> My PS5 runs it fine but it keeps crashing like crazy
[0:40:51] <%missingangle> bruh, that's valid
[0:40:54] <%tigerfang86> oh no
[0:40:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @neroforte177 Subverse is progressing nicely. I haven't touched the backer beta at all, but the game is gradually happening.

[0:40:57] <%tigerfang86> the dick ruined it
[0:40:57] <%SvenHolgersson> BUT THAT DICK THO
[0:40:58] <$realm_forge> Playing Skyrim on Xbox with mods is less buggy
[0:40:59] <+WutangchickeN> cyberpunk makes skyrim look like hades 1.0
[0:40:59] <+Mendin> His charactger was Zangief?
[0:41:00] <%TheMattman1313> I wonder if this will get an In-Goodening like No Man's Sky?
[0:41:01] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You don't do that during important conversations?
[0:41:03] <+RowenCleric> thats my reaction to important life events too
[0:41:03] <%baka_sugoi> the moment when your PP is hard

[0:52:01] <mortificent> SHIN FINAL PARTY
[0:52:02] <Mangahero18> So if you wanna do the cool crimes like a yakuzy use a gamepad. Also, you are WAY overlevelled pat.
[0:52:02] <%tigerfang86> all of the party is top tier character wise
[0:52:04] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Who's your tank then

[0:52:31] <primarch_lupercal> i seriously do wonder if eri's was supposed to have more involvement but then the devs decided not
[0:52:31] <%gnarly_memes_bro> you don't need a tank in turn-based games come on now

[0:58:58] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @patstaresat honestly it doesn't even really matter, a lot of the late game bosses either throttle your damage or have massive defense pools to keep your from breaking them too hard
[0:59:01] <+tehbuu> runs into final boss at level 70 lmao
[0:59:05] <%honeyman18> diabolic is better

[0:59:20] <%Istrael25> @patstaresat would Kiryu use a gamepad?
[0:59:21] <Blank9> diabolic wristband is better than profane
[0:59:28] <+razielhex> @patriotrenegade The only good Battlefield is BAD COMPANY 2
[0:59:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> the final boss is still hard at 70
[0:59:31] <%coreyyotto> does anybody know what Dex does yet? I still don't know what dex does
[0:59:31] <MarioGalaxyMan25> Do you enjoy Chris Redfield as Sonic?

[1:00:25] <%McSoliace> i thought it was the arena
[1:00:26] <+razielhex> @patriotrenegade My Favorite DICE interview was when they admitted that Bad Company 2 had the best multiplayer experience they ever had in a game and they have no idea why it's so good so they can't replicate it.
[1:00:26] <$Skelemungus> there are better one
[1:00:30] <%rumtumtugnutz> You wouldn’t download a penis, why would you suck at a video game
[1:00:31] <%Wiithan6> yeah Ichi's agi kinda falls off late game if you don't boost it, at least that's how it seemed in my playthrough
[1:00:33] <%Garthunox> @Joe2187 of course it but HE DOESNT HAVE IT!
[1:00:35] <TReaperx1> @PatStaresAt from hero stuff and catching sujimon you get a better one
[1:00:41] <%honeyman18> The Tiger belt adds 80MP
[1:00:43] <%coreyyotto> there is a better one but you don't have it yet
[1:00:43] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt better one is chapter 15
[1:00:49] <$Skelemungus> that you could get sorry
[1:00:53] <%krispen_wa> Power ring? More like Superpower ring
[1:00:53] <%Joe2187> I dont remember where I even got the dragons tear
[1:00:54] <Blank9> I'd slap the curse doll on ichiban too, just because it's game over if he gets instakilled
[1:00:55] <%HedgehogGames1> Did Pat do some grinding offscreen?
[1:00:59] <fabo_joyful> Gracias por el 2020Delivery, @titothegaminggod.
[1:01:05] <%krispen_wa> He did not actually
[1:01:07] <%krispen_wa> surprisingly
[1:01:08] <jojomzo> one guy
[1:01:08] <%gnarly_memes_bro> you don't have the better one yet

[1:01:11] <%HefestoForges> @PatStaresAt it's in a future chapter
[1:01:13] <GigaSeifer> you don't have the better one yet
[1:01:14] <%MonsterEnvy> He does not need to grind anymore. He will reach proper endgame power just playing the story.
[1:01:14] <TReaperx1> after collecting all sujimon
[1:01:16] <%StaceMcGate> Dragon Tear is chapter 15

[1:02:50] <%MonsterEnvy> @PatStaresAt You don't have it yet. Also you don't need to grind anymore. You are at the softcap and level 55 is good enough for endgame. Which you will easily surpass now just by doing story stuff alone.
[1:02:52] <Blank9> precious old man
[1:02:54] <%tigerfang86> what if we SHOT THEM
[1:02:55] <+Double_Tap_That> Man I love the Yokohama battle theme
[1:02:55] <%cache_22> This game released pretty polished. I'm impressed they've fixed so much since I played through it.
[1:02:59] <$Skelemungus> wat if
[1:03:03] <RyeBreadBakery> dad bods tho
[1:03:04] <colzack_> those party chats are definitely one of the best additions with the move to full jrpg

[1:03:27] <%krispen_wa> WITH FINESSE
[1:03:28] <PkSilent01> we finishing yakuza today?
[1:03:31] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Yeah the story bosses softcap around 55, its kind of frustrating
[1:03:37] <+Beetlewins> This seems like an unfair matchup tbh. Inflatable floaties vs guns
[1:03:40] <%bread_assassin> Did Pat get the job DLC? Matriarch is fuckin' busted.
[1:03:41] <%sonofthedeepsouth> SOFT
[1:03:44] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt no point in grinding until chapter 15
[1:03:46] <%sonofthedeepsouth> NAH MORE
[1:03:50] <%coreyyotto> psaBig one guy on that
[1:03:51] <$Skelemungus> youre golden

[1:03:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 4m.
[1:03:55] <%CrowbarFacelift> flaccid cap
[1:03:55] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Yeah eri as matriarch kicks ass
[1:03:56] <%JeanGardner99> You think that will stop Pat?
[1:03:58] <%krispen_wa> Yeah, he got matriarch and it's GUN
[1:04:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Eh I beat the game at lv 51
[1:04:01] <+razielhex> @bread_assassin I think I saw that as a job.
[1:04:02] <%sonofthedeepsouth> 100% RUN
[1:04:06] <+Mendin> You completion everything so give us Amon
[1:04:06] <SaltyAzteca> Hey Pat HeyGuys
[1:04:06] <%BoxNavy> im pat :)
[1:04:06] <%sonofthedeepsouth> R you Pat tho
[1:04:06] <%Solipsist_Construct> Pretty much you should be good, grinding much better once you progress more
[1:04:07] <Zarkith> THE Pat!?!? imaChamp
[1:04:07] <%SpcOpsBear> psa1guy
[1:04:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Had no problems at like level 53
[1:04:10] <%coreyyotto> Final dungeon is closer to 65-70 but you're good for now
[1:04:11] <Mahbonk> you're pretty much set
[1:04:12] <%SvenHolgersson> You're gucci my dude
[1:04:13] <$Skelemungus> better dungeon comin up anyways
[1:04:13] <Blank9> You're strong enough to beat the game now
[1:04:15] <%Puhff> youre pat4
[1:04:15] <Memitim> what chapter is this?
[1:04:15] <RyeBreadBakery> next stream Pat's gonna be like "so i did some grinding off screen"
[1:04:16] <Mahbonk> you did a lot more than i did
[1:04:18] <+tehbuu> thanks whoever told him to longer grind <3 big ups we can see him face a challenge of sorts
[1:04:22] <%st_jimmy456> Hey there everyone, welcome back to PatStaresAt, I'm your host Greg
[1:04:23] <Blank9> though I did the grind at the end and was like level 64
[1:04:24] <%radda343> playing yakuzie 0 is making me miss ichiban's infinite sprint
[1:04:25] <+loukemia83> Eri as Dealer is great, Dart Throw very good
[1:04:26] <colzack_> grinding any more would just be to get op which is also valid
[1:04:35] <+tehbuu> @Memitim chapter 13
[1:04:35] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @jeangardner99 I'm normally just like lat but I was pissed off with how much my grinding didn't matte from the last boss fight
[1:04:36] <Sulfur_Boride> I'm the best! I'm Ichiban!
[1:04:36] <GigaSeifer> @PatStaresAt yeah, you'll be fine, I beat the game with my party in the high 30s
[1:04:36] <%damienlunas> damienlunas subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months, currently on a 13 month streak! At the end of Dragon Quest 1, the Dragonlord offers you a chance to rule the world at his side and get a bad ending. I'm wondering if this game will have an homage to that.
[1:04:36] <%SvenHolgersson> Well then win then
[1:04:37] <%krispen_wa> So Majima and Saejima was basically the biggest wall?
[1:04:38] <%SvenHolgersson> Ya winner
[1:04:39] <%tawdymcstoic> @PatStaresAt also the last 7 or 6 substories is locked behind your social stats
[1:04:39] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats orb is flexing he's so strong
[1:04:42] <fIashman92> Does Pat have enough stats for ther omance?
[1:04:43] <%Blackleafx> ME
[1:04:43] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Pat if you saw the world as Ichiban did what job would you be titled under?
[1:04:44] <+razielhex> 7.6M Yen. Still poor as shit and living in garbage.
[1:04:44] <%MonsterEnvy> @coreyyotto That is a lie final boss is level 60
[1:04:47] <TheHeroAppears> me
[1:04:48] <%st_jimmy456> Loser patrol
[1:04:50] <Memitim> @radda343 you can upgrade your sprint at the shrine
[1:04:51] <%StaceMcGate> @krispen_wa one more
[1:04:58] <%SpcOpsBear> GO TO SCHOOL
[1:04:59] <%damienlunas> @A_Real_American_Trash_Can Influencer
[1:05:01] <hassanico2> More exams?
[1:05:04] <hassanico2> wow
[1:05:06] <%JeanGardner99> @gnarly_memes_bro yeah that one got me too lmao
[1:05:07] <Blank9> recommended menu items never give the party conversations
[1:05:09] <%gnarly_memes_bro> BEAT THE GAME YEYEYEYE
[1:05:10] <tsnakesrule> Grinding more means you wanna do legend mode and grindr all jobs to 99 for end dungeon
[1:05:10] <@SoFarFetched> thats fair
[1:05:12] <%BoxNavy> beat the game wooo
[1:05:12] <%sonofthedeepsouth> nah 100 percent run
[1:05:13] <%coreyyotto> @MonsterEnvy might be thinking of the bonus dungeon
[1:05:14] <%SvenHolgersson> The one is also morally questionable
[1:05:14] <%radda343> @Memitim I'm aware
[1:05:15] <fIashman92> Fail more exams for our entertainment
[1:05:16] <%StaceMcGate> why are you walking?
[1:05:16] <colzack_> fair
[1:05:16] <%SvenHolgersson> So theres that
[1:05:16] <%televisedrevolting> You can just look them up.
[1:05:17] <$Skelemungus> no love link aww
[1:05:19] <%AzureGale> Cheer500 I love me a good surprise stream :o
[1:05:19] <%bread_assassin> Fair.
[1:05:20] <%tawdymcstoic> thats fine
[1:05:20] <+fishteevee> i ended up skipping most of the final stories since i was only able to max out two of the stats
[1:05:20] <+Dova573> Do it bitch, you wont
[1:05:21] <%AzureGale> AzureGale's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:05:25] <%sonofthedeepsouth> do it tho

[1:05:26] <%CrazyMedicine> Chapter 13 and 14 tonight then?
[1:05:27] <%NeedlesD> entirely fair
[1:05:28] <+RowenCleric> premium adventure works great in tis anyways
[1:05:30] <TheHeroAppears> it's not great
[1:05:30] <%sonofthedeepsouth> DO. IT.
[1:05:30] <UlriktheSlayer1> story good so far looking forward to end
[1:05:31] <%krispen_wa> The "Who's hungry" sounds way less goofy in JPN because it's just a simple "itadakimasu"
[1:05:32] <%MonsterEnvy> That is fine
[1:05:35] <hassanico2> wowwow
[1:05:36] <%Lion_kun> Pat you have to do the last substory on screen
[1:05:38] <%brachydios777> I say continue with story
[1:05:38] <ape_hawk> why not?
[1:05:38] <%MonsterEnvy> I don't do that stuff
[1:05:39] <%SvenHolgersson> Dungeons aren't worth it
[1:05:40] <%zanzibar_junker> Its short
[1:05:44] <TheHeroAppears> I'm doing it though
[1:05:45] <+soflicar> the exams get you close to max fast
[1:05:46] <nmaten> lame
[1:05:46] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you can clear super dungeon lvl 60, the ULTRA SUPER dungeon requires lvl 99
[1:05:49] <+tetraes> theres a lil story cutscene in the super dungeon
[1:05:50] <%Lion_kun> It is amazing.
[1:05:51] <colzack_> You actually don't need to do all subs for amon in this which is cool
[1:05:53] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt If you don't do them then look up the last substory on youtube. It's fantastic.
[1:05:56] <%Puhff> You mean you're not going for Platinum?!
[1:05:58] <%coreyyotto> The NG+ dungeon is bullshit but the regular version is kinda neat

[1:34:44] <+coldsama> @kingvantq meh fair enough, it's not hard to get but it's boring to grind Ichiban Holdings
[1:34:46] <+Godlike_Turtle> First time catching it live. Been a fan of Pat since years ago when I searched for Eternal Darkness playthroughs. I don't call my cat peepee instead she is fuckass
[1:34:52] <%BoxNavy> @Dunmarkh yeah i know i just saw someone get mad just now
[1:34:54] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @grimlockfly its sort of depressing how good daigo is as a summon considering how terrible he is as a character
[1:34:56] <%DashXero> @krispen_wa Oh. I thought he just went and played the business management game...
[1:35:01] <eco419> he is peeing crests
[1:35:03] <%Lizard0TM> Pat is pissing out 92 tojo clan crest
[1:35:05] <%DashXero> @tanarath I see...
[1:35:07] <%ElectricEmissary> @hefestoforges I more meant during the woolie and eyepatch wolf playthrough of the mystical ninja, when woolie revealed they were playing on an emulator the whole time

[1:35:25] <NitronStreams> P.E.E. Pat Excretes Emblems

[1:36:41] <%gnarly_memes_bro> As it turns out, what I thought was severe constipation was actually 92 tojo crests lodged into my sphincter
[1:36:54] <T_Sasquatch> i justt want to say grinding for red orbs for ex provocation fucking sucks

[1:39:55] <%HedgehogGames1> Oh no his bladder's so full he can't even stand!
[1:39:55] <$spardanwarrior> JUST POOP ON THE COUCH
[1:39:55] <dante_suoh> 1000 crests are hard to find
[1:39:55] <%televisedrevolting> He's gotta aim his piss up the stairs.
[1:39:58] <+BlackLightRadia> Damn he's not that old yet is he?
[1:39:59] <fIashman92> Never smile like that again
[1:40:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Getting old man. Stream starts to slow down. Not the same force.
[1:40:01] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaDogchamp psaPorgmo psaPat psaPorgmo psaDogchamp
[1:40:02] <%Encrouched> did pat poo himself again
[1:40:02] <%CrowbarFacelift> sometimes you have to let things brew for a while before releasing, I understand
[1:40:03] <+vaderxyz1970> He gave up half way to come back down to let us know it would be a while
[1:40:04] <ShadeTheNovice> how considerate of pat to stop his piss mid stream to tell us that Kappa
[1:40:06] <%OvenmittDeluxe> CHUNKY PISS
[1:40:06] <%SaiyanShoto> HMMMMMM psaSmug
[1:40:09] <%cache_22> Pat has to climb up the squatty potty and everything.

[1:40:14] <letsgo3212312> hes taking a bin
[1:40:26] <%HefestoForges> He's looking for the right hex code for the pee registry
[1:40:27] <wohdin> MAXIMUM STOOL
[1:40:27] <Louie_Salmon> @vaderxyz1970 And that's very considerate of him, what a hero
[1:40:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> That’s gotta be the longest buttcrack in the whulrd
[1:40:29] <eco419> you saw that big smirk he did it
[1:40:30] <lem______> what I miss so far today
[1:40:30] <%Omegaanimus> did the toilet just grow taller?
[1:40:32] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Man somebody should really give the Tojo clan a call about those crests, maybe apply a bittering agent so short gingers don't eat so many of them
[1:40:42] <%Encrouched> poo coming out both ends
[1:40:47] <%PigGuy800> are the crests just those little lapel pins they wear?
[1:40:48] <%zuckerkick> Thanks for the pee break update, very considerate.
[1:40:49] <farrellcityking> He’s just letting zangief... AGAIN! 🙄 Cant make it 2 seconds without that dog.
[1:40:49] <%CrowbarFacelift> Elmo hogging the bathroom again
[1:40:50] <orcstr16> This is a preview of Pat's streaming future. One day this piss break will be real.
[1:41:04] <%Omegaanimus> fecal matter out of EVERY hole
[1:41:08] <farrellcityking> petting*
[1:41:14] <%Encrouched> more like Zangrief amirite
[1:41:16] <eco419> Kreygasm
[1:41:25] <%Omegaanimus> could you imagine shitting out through your eye sockets?
[1:41:33] <Louie_Salmon> He's looking for the cheat code that edits the coordinates of the piss to be outside his body
[1:41:33] <%Korzodin> Korzodin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! Hey Pat. Ever check out the classic Doom modding community? And if so, would you ever be interested in streaming Doom mods?
[1:41:37] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Tojo clan crests are just hyper-compressed poopoo, you heard it here first
[1:41:40] <farrellcityking> Lol@ Zangrief. Awesome!
[1:41:45] <farrellcityking> Dumb dog
[1:41:46] <%aram909> im using this break to make some progress on FINAL MILLENIUM TOWER
[1:41:49] <%McSoliace> searching for the perfect Piss hole is a very long and time consuming job chat
[1:41:56] <%aram909> this final dungeon is hard as fuck
[1:42:03] <Gamer76255> So has anything actually happened yet, or this pretty much the start?
[1:42:11] <%zuckerkick> OMG, so Tojo Clan crests are a bit like the "Korok Seeds"?
[1:42:18] <TheHeroAppears> @aram909 I almost died to the two robots at the start
[1:42:21] <farrellcityking> MORE ELMO!!! No more dog!
[1:42:26] <%krispen_wa> ichiban is running for president now
[1:42:27] <redrins> @zuckerkick mini medals
[1:42:28] <%aram909> @Gamer76255 pat made some progress and now he's doing some "hacking" to get a certain item
[1:42:37] <Louie_Salmon> @zuckerkick Less hidden, and they are farmable
[1:42:46] <Gamer76255> @aram909 Thank you
[1:42:51] <farrellcityking> *misses the Elmo on steam days*
[1:42:58] <farrellcityking> Stream*
[1:43:00] <TheHeroAppears> @zuckerkick no
[1:43:05] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Tojo clan crests are the compressed essence of crimes that tojo clansmen must periodically release, lest the crime juices build up
[1:43:10] <%brachydios777> Time to deliver a pizza ball to the prime minister’s office
[1:43:13] <huskarl_zap> bro how long does cheat engine take
[1:43:35] <%QueequegTheater> Is CE a violation of TOS?
[1:43:38] <%Lion_kun> Itll be worth it
[1:43:38] <%DashXero> Depends on how proficient you are at using it...
[1:43:39] <%cache_22> I wonder if Pat is also searching for that Ceramic Boxcutter for Eri in the bathroom too.
[1:43:39] <%DappercatEsquire> cheat eng-what? pat's shitting
[1:43:40] <%Jaxnos> we caused this despair
[1:43:44] <%krispen_wa> hes intentionally drawing it out because he doesnt want to meet DAIGO
[1:43:53] <Louie_Salmon> Did everyone see that Zack Snyder's Batman will do a big swear because he is so tough and cool
[1:43:53] <%mike2hands> wow this is a big ol PISS
[1:43:56] <farrellcityking> Is Pat trying to inspect Paige again? I thought she knew he wasn’t a real gynecologist.
[1:44:02] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @cache_22 he may as well at this point
[1:44:11] <%iosephe> He's just going to the bathroom, and maybe getting a surprise delivery of Tojo Crests
[1:44:25] <Blank9> pat is putting in a lot of work for the man he cried over in 6
[1:44:32] <@SoFarFetched> Pat's gotta poop out those Tojo Clan Crests,one by one Kappa
[1:44:35] <Blank9> he's emotionally invested
[1:44:36] <%StaceMcGate> fun fact: there is actually 100 tojo crests right outside the hotel
[1:44:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @louie_salmon "Fuck Batman"
[1:44:41] <%SvenHolgersson> He just loves Daigo so much
[1:44:47] <%SvenHolgersson> It means alot to him to summon the man
[1:44:52] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Listen guys, if kat has to take a poop and he accidentally poops put all the tojo crests he needs thats a lucky day in my book
[1:44:53] <%HedgehogGames1> "Did you know urine is made of Tojo Crests - it's true!"
[1:44:55] <%krispen_wa> "Fuck Robin"
[1:44:55] <%StaceMcGate> Daigo did nothing wrong
[1:45:04] <%HefestoForges> @QueequegTheater Any activity, such as cheating, hacking, botting, or tampering, that gives the account owner an unfair advantage in an online multiplayer game, is prohibited. This also includes exploiting another broadcaster's live broadcast in order to harass them in-game, such as stream sniping.
[1:45:07] <%KineKithZen> He fell in guys
[1:45:08] <%king_wragles> Pat are you fucking DRAWING the crests? C'mon man
[1:45:11] <orcstr16> Has Daigo accomplished anything. I genuinely can't remember
[1:45:14] <+Mendin> Summoning Daigo has him fail to do anything, but then Kiryu shows up and punches it
[1:45:17] <%HefestoForges> only in online games quee
[1:45:19] <%gnarly_memes_bro> Daigo might have done a couple of things wrong guys
[1:45:28] <%KineKithZen> Online multiplayer game
[1:45:30] <%lastnamesilverlastname> Pissing the world away
[1:45:32] <%krispen_wa> @orcstr16 he succesffuly destroyed the Tojo clan!
[1:45:33] <%QueequegTheater> Thanks
[1:45:33] <Blank9> daigo really did do nothing wrong, kiryu should've given the tojo to kashiwagi
[1:45:34] <%AzureGale> @HedgehogGames1 The more you know ★
[1:45:42] <huskarl_zap> His name is Daigo
[1:45:49] <robotman37> @gnarly_memes_bro Only a couple
[1:45:54] <%missingangle> I think Pat died via cheating, I mean pissing
[1:45:59] <%aram909> daigo was such an asshole in yakuza 0
[1:46:02] <Blank9> why would you give the tojo to a drunk deadbeat guy in his 20s after you broke it
[1:46:08] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Pat is busy teaching Daigo how to piss. He never learned how to do it without Kiryu to hold his peepee for him.
[1:46:09] <%Blackleafx> how long has it been since he left initially? five mins?
[1:46:10] <huskarl_zap> "I'm like a fucking onion Ichibong."
[1:46:14] <hassanico2> man Millenium Tower isn't even that long or hard he could probably kick its ass now
[1:46:16] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Pat's bathroom battle is all on you chat
[1:46:25] <ShadeTheNovice> surely hes dehydrated by this point, how much piss can he possibly have left?
[1:46:32] <KingVantq> the Orb isnt as young as it use to be takes awhile to empty
[1:46:34] <%Keaton_x> Kidney stones? Bitch please. You ever try passing 92 Tojo Clan Crests? Give the poor man a minute!
[1:46:35] <+TDotGoat> Pat died on the way to the piss planet
[1:46:48] <%jorniev> PAT IS TAKING A LIFE OR DEATH MONDO SHIT

[2:58:14] <%miguelrod777> The most terrible of confidences
[2:58:15] <%MisterRockett> Wasn't it weird that the locker was locked? Why would she lock it if she wanted her baby found?

[2:58:32] <%TheMattman1313> So now Ichi is 100% Arakawa's kid. His mom was helped by the Shangri-La folks at the last second
[2:58:33] <zachataxx> Every Yakuza game has at least one purely circumstantial plot twist
[2:58:35] <Lalunite> @PatStaresAt This was an actual problem in japan so it's not that much of a coincidence
[2:58:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> The most absurd coincidence so far.
[2:58:37] <Bryon_Youngblood> @Undenizen I got a BAD feeling the baby died.
[2:58:38] <%AlphaRayAllen> OH NO
[2:58:39] <%CalderGaming> IT'S INVERSE BROLY AND GOKU?!

[2:59:05] <CurrySauseBandit> Who would have thought, his genetics, not his being raised by Yakuza since birth made him a scumbag. Crazy.

[2:59:19] <MasterTonberry23> this twist is pretty out there, but its not the dumbest thing this series has done, not by a long shot

[2:59:59] <T_Sasquatch> just walk 4Head
[3:00:03] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Man, this kid needed a smack in the mouth at an EARLY age.
[3:00:05] <%Blackleafx> @TyrianPurpleHaze at least oda didnt abuse babie

[3:00:06] <%Deft_Thought> Hey guys, remember how he shot the chairman in the chest 5 minutes ago
[3:00:06] <+Undenizen> y'know, kids who can't walk tend not to think this way. they just think of themselves as normal
[3:00:07] <zachataxx> Fun Fact: This is apparently based on a story called "Coin Locker Babies", in which this exact thing happens
[3:00:08] <%ElectricEmissary> they should never have stopped echoing
[3:00:08] <%chibicheezit> I can't believe people put unwanted babies in coin lockers. like, is a police station or something not an option as long as they do it covertly??
[3:00:09] <huskarl_zap> Cuckoo Arakawa
[3:00:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Except all the times Kiryu turns back
[3:00:12] <%Birdigalore> 5 years gave Arakawa old man voice lol
[3:00:13] <+Chronobot> he turned into takai in 5 years
[3:00:13] <%reonome> aoki can walk now so its fine
[3:00:13] <BurdRightsActivist> JUST USE YOUR LEGS 4Head

[3:00:21] <%Kataguro> Like Jo DOES have a heart. It's just really small and shitty
[3:00:22] <%Ner234> So did Arakawa die not knowing this?
[3:00:22] <%za7az> @jorniev THAT MAKES IT SO MUCH WORSE
[3:00:22] <%mike2hands> i love this guitar track
[3:00:25] <%ElectricEmissary> and you should've fucking come clean.
[3:00:26] <livi242> watch the next game make Pat cry for Jo
[3:00:32] <mighty_fine_trousers> Isn't the problem he had too many smacks as a kid? Drunk father and all
[3:00:33] <GigaSeifer> dude swearing an oath gets you free sake? sign me up!

[3:06:50] <%Ner234> It's both dumb and extremely tragic at the same
[3:06:52] <TyrianPurpleHaze> The worst part is that Arakawa loved Ichiban like a son and never got to know he really WAS his son.
[3:06:52] <%notsoy> how high does this rank on the list of dumbest Yakuza plot twists?
[3:06:52] <+titansloth93> oh this is HIGHEST Melodrama
[3:06:54] <%fat_burtreynolds> If I had your life and you had mine
[3:06:54] <%goose_attack_almanac> It should be pointed out that Ichiban knowing this can do NOTHING for him to help his situation. It'll only give him emotional anguish

[3:07:46] <%linSP> but wait its a maybe
[3:07:46] <%cache_22> We should have a poll on dumbest Yakuza plot twist.
[3:07:47] <%iosephe> I like how they handle this dumbass twist in the end though
[3:07:47] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yes no Yakuza 6's Boat is THE WORST, this is second though
[3:07:48] <%Deft_Thought> We hid a boat and killed anyone who knew about this boat. By the way. N I C E B O A T
[3:07:49] <PkSilent01> RUBBER BOAT BULLETS
[3:07:50] <Blank9> the boat is incredible because if you say big boat three times in a mirror, takeshi will show up and shoot you
[3:07:50] <TyrianPurpleHaze> This is the worst, but it's also the BEST.
[3:07:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> I think the "kiryu was there during the massacre" was pretty dumb
[3:07:54] <%SaiyanShoto> psaElmo psaElmo psaElmo
[3:07:56] <%thegreatsun> I can see Pat and Chat being the type watch soap opera and feel a sense of superiority from it.

[3:08:28] <%luckypineapple> hows yakuza treating pat?
[3:08:29] <CelestialCage> how the fuck do they do that
[3:08:29] <wrydiculous> This twist is inspired by an actual Japanese novel
[3:08:29] <+GingerStrawhat> THE END OF THE YAKUZA?!?!?!?! WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?!?!?!?
[3:08:30] <shoukenz> THE END OF YAKUZA

[3:08:45] <Yesaye94> Someone make Yakuza into an anime series right now
[3:08:45] <@SoFarFetched> "Will Krillin survive?? Time to find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z: KRILLIN'S NOBLE SACRIFICE"
[3:08:47] <DestroyerPhoenix> completely by coincidence that arakawa came to save his real son then
[3:08:47] <+LandOfTheWay> GOODBYE JO(jo)
[3:08:48] <+tehbuu> Light And Darkness
[3:08:49] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt You realize this means Ichiban was in the cold that put Masato in a chair for HOURS longer and was fine? He really IS Number One!
[3:08:49] <%Dakuu75> thank you Vergil
[3:08:50] <%slrls_> how is Steve Yeun so bad at Korean :(
[3:08:55] <colzack_> I honestly love this twist, like yeah it's a giant coincidence and stuff but that's Yakuza for you, it's great

[3:08:56] <%CherteuseKapibara> the sex shop is too loud
[3:08:57] <+Chronobot> this porn music is ruining it
[3:08:58] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Yokoyama is over-doing it with the twists though, I am growing tired of his writing tbh
[3:08:59] <Daniel_Is_I> "You're late, Ichi"
[3:08:59] <%tigerfang86> damn son
[3:09:00] <tsnakesrule> So yeah Ichiban totally has brain damage

[3:09:01] <olaksi> It's an incredible coincidence, but it's where the story starts too so it kinda works?
[3:09:01] <%Blackleafx> THE TWIST
[3:09:02] <%ElectricEmissary> yeah
[3:09:02] <Remedy020> rooREE Jo's the reason why Ichi got a fish on his back and not a dragon like real yakuza
[3:09:02] <SaltyAzteca> but why
[3:09:03] <GeltonZ> This needs a Spanish dub so it can be a Telenovella
[3:09:03] <%reonome> OH SHIT
[3:09:03] <+Grayhammatter> what...
[3:09:03] <+coupdegrayce> the real tragedy is that Arakawa Knew and blew off Kasuga for dinner to go hang out with one of his crime friends. Reconnect with your son you sent to prison in the place of your adopted son? phsew, nah.

[3:12:04] <%ElectricEmissary> and then he sent his son to jail for his other son
[3:12:04] <%h0wiewong> He probably looked into it
[3:12:05] <Tooniearcade> He knew
[3:12:05] <Remedy020> Maybe to protect him?
[3:12:05] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yes he did

[3:12:11] <%ElectricEmissary> :(

[3:12:12] <+paladinstarbuster> thats why he cut the finger
[3:12:13] <%gnarly_memes_bro> OK but we don't KNOW that he's actually Arakawa's son, only that he's Akane's son
[3:12:13] <redrins> what a shit
[3:12:13] <huskarl_zap> DAMN IT IF ONLY I COULD OF BEEN A CRIME BRAT
[3:12:15] <PkSilent01> saw him in the 90a*

[3:12:18] <+Jaromero435> Big Sad BibleThump
[3:12:19] <DestroyerPhoenix> the way arakawa was talking made me think that he knew, that spoiled it more than the chapter title if you're gonna go with that
[3:12:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> That’s why he saved you, you fuck
[3:12:20] <GigaSeifer> the idea that ichiban's soapland dads never told ANYONE that he came out of a coin locker is a little much, he surely knew
[3:12:21] <Hellarussian> evil glasses-man
[3:12:22] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Oh, he 100% knew as soon as he met Ichiban that this was his real son.
[3:12:23] <MarvelousMrD> kasuga probably looks like his mom
[3:12:24] <%TheMattman1313> Did Aoki know?

[3:12:29] <Huffenpuffy> why keep the other baby then?
[3:12:30] <%missingangle> I wonder if he knew or if he felt that Ichiban being his son would've felt right.
[3:12:32] <%coreyyotto> THAT DAY
[3:12:34] <%Bt_Robot> It's my blood!
[3:12:34] <%Kataguro> Power...I need more power!

[3:27:43] <Hellarussian> Jason Derulo
[3:27:45] <Sulfur_Boride> His name is Darryl Kurylo. The only other role I know him as is Alex Mercer in prototype 2
[3:27:45] <%KineKithZen> It's very clear that despite some weird pronunciations in places, the direction here is much better
[3:27:47] <%krispen_wa> Darryl Kiryu
[3:27:50] <GeltonZ> I think he was a TV actor
[3:27:52] <%AlphaRayAllen> Darryl Kiryu it is
[3:27:53] <Daniel_Is_I> BOLD CLAIM
[3:27:53] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I wasn't sure with what we heard at Omi last stream, but this scene sealed it, he's fucking perfect
[3:27:53] <%transporterthesequel> Everything's on fire,, "Vergil: Everything is under control."
[3:27:56] <Kiaayo> also the voice of alex mercer
[3:27:57] <highfivesquash> unlimited poweeeer-san
[3:27:58] <tranman090> Kiryu could probably beat him down
[3:28:03] <%tigerfang86> there are TONS of people trying to stop you right now Aoki
[3:28:08] <%Hotironclad> I think Aoki is a good villian
[3:28:10] <%DukeBlack_> he also voiced Alex Mercer
[3:28:10] <%AzureGale> No one man should have all that power
[3:28:11] <ape_hawk> *majima laughs in the background*
[3:28:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> How many people in the govt have an orbital laser?
[3:28:15] <Golden_Battler> Aoki NEEDS more power
[3:28:17] <+Delenay> nah man. aokis on them drugs
[3:28:20] <zachataxx> To be fair, Yakuza 1 localization was just "add swears to every sentence to make it real edgy"
[3:28:21] <Meekest> We're gonna kick this man through that window
[3:28:21] <Daniel_Is_I> Need more POWER
[3:28:22] <Remedy020> Yikes only got there because Arakawa funded him rooBlank
[3:28:28] <%tigerfang86> OH NO
[3:28:28] <RyeBreadBakery> Aoki is GETTING MOTIVATED
[3:28:29] <+PriFa> Damn, Jameson Price really only has that one voice
[3:28:30] <NeroInfinite> So is Aoki gonna try to ice the police comissionernow?
[3:28:31] <%tigerfang86> IT WAS THE COOL GUY
[3:28:32] <follyofjolly> But he needs MORE power
[3:28:33] <%hrbeck_> I like Aoki as a villain
[3:28:33] <uncle_speeps> aoki is the first good yakuza villain since 3
[3:28:34] <AMaidIndeed> that was a cool shot
[3:28:36] <mortificent> Is this a Dante in DMC 4 situation?
[3:28:36] <%Kataguro> Ishioda is crazy
[3:28:37] <Blank9> aoki is so much better than nishiki
[3:28:37] <%tigerfang86> NOT THE COOL GUY
[3:28:37] <%AlphaRayAllen> Looks like superman, acts like lex luthor
[3:28:40] <%maenos2> is that what's his name from re4

[3:31:09] <%brachydios777> @aram909 I know, but does it translate to something or a meaning in Japanese?
[3:31:09] <garbageheaphound> Ichiban suffers hard
[3:31:11] <%aram909> it was the first time any of my party members ever got knocked out
[3:31:13] <%Grimlockfly> I was just joking about finishing it tonight, but it really is a straight shot to the end of you mainline focus, huh?
[3:31:17] <%GalacticaPhanto> I mean I beat the game but this chapter fucks with him
[3:31:20] <%gnarly_memes_bro> @conlin_arts_ gnight friend
[3:31:34] <garbageheaphound> im worried about the future games if he gets it this bad in his introduction
[3:31:36] <%Omegaanimus> both Aoki and Ichiban are just willing to go to crazy lengths to get what they want, it's just that Aoki is a dick and Ichiban wants to do the right thing
[3:31:41] <%GalacticaPhanto> Yeah he only has one more chapter plus new grindspot
[3:31:45] <%owazowski> I think needlessly tragic describes the whole Yakuza series really well

[3:32:21] <%honeyman18> This track is pretty good coming up
[3:32:27] <mortificent> that factoid that locker babies were a real thing in Japan still fucks me up

[3:55:56] <+xeros720> oh yeah, the green dragon is isn't it?

[3:56:06] <%missingangle> It's like that in Pokemon too
[3:56:08] <TheHeroAppears> all dragons are weak to ice that's not really anything crazy
[3:56:08] <Djinnazz> Unless it's an ice drgon
[3:56:08] <%furiousfurioso> IS THAT WHY THEY ARE IN POKEMON TOO
[3:56:08] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean that makes sense right?
[3:56:10] <%televisedrevolting> IT'S ALSO CAUSE HE NEEDS HEAT FOR HIS MOVES

[3:56:57] <%greasypete00> HES IN THE PARRY STANCE
[3:56:57] <VritraReiRei> @PatStaresAt do you think it would be worth it to just have the guys just block 100% of the time and let the girls handle it
[3:56:57] <%tigerfang86> DO IT COWARD
[3:56:58] <SaltyAzteca> MAJIMA
[3:56:59] <CelestialCage> DO Let HAN DO IT
[3:57:03] <eco419> PUSSA

[3:57:07] <jojomzo> he kick
[3:57:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> once? as a treat
[3:57:10] <%Bt_Robot> Wouldn't little girl summon do extra damage?
[3:57:13] <%jorniev> DONT STARE AT KYRYU WHILE ROYAL GUARDING
[3:57:13] <%thegreatsun> He is taking easy on you huh
[3:57:14] <gungniir_> He did a kick cuz he's fishing for Tiger Drop
[3:57:15] <+fishteevee> kiryu looking musky
[3:57:15] <wrydiculous> Also that's the most aura fire i have ever seen out of kiryu
[3:57:16] <DusK_The_Stray> I thought you wanted to step the fuck up
[3:57:16] <%Dakuu75> lol
[3:57:17] <%h0wiewong> Wow he really does not care
[3:57:17] <%TheBensonator_> LUL
[3:57:18] <$Skelemungus> eh pat can you try a regular attack with a guy?
[3:57:20] <ukokira> ukokira subscribed at Tier 1. 
[3:57:25] <RetributionP> COOL HIS HEAT
[3:57:25] <Djinnazz> he doesn't care
[3:57:26] <%KineKithZen> Ice cools off heat, seems legit
[3:57:29] <%ukokira> Yeehaw
[3:57:29] <TheHardM> Kiryu doesn't sell.
[3:57:30] <tsnakesrule> Kiryu isn't in red heat, nor using all his moves
[3:57:32] <%tigerfang86> NO COMBOS AT ALL
[3:57:33] <%AtlasMcCoy> KICK
[3:57:34] <tanarath> summon majima
[3:57:34] <+DigitalPelican> use the k drama summon
[3:57:35] <Ravingpyro> do it
[3:57:37] <Blank9> he's baiting the tiger drops, that's why he's kicking
[3:57:37] <Monkeyweed21> He's not even trying
[3:57:37] <%Hotironclad> of course LUL
[3:57:37] <SirDogBear> make sure to take Kiryu out before he spams drinking 3 drinks from his item menu LUL
[3:57:38] <Thepothero> Id spam that ice bucket
[3:57:40] <+Chronobot> He hasnt even dragon dropped you
[3:57:40] <TyrianPurpleHaze> He doesn't even fucking CARE.
[3:57:41] <+Delenay> only time majima might beat kiryu is when hes summoned as a friend in someone elses fight
[3:57:41] <%Bt_Robot> ASK HIM FOR A DONATION
[3:57:43] <%AlphaRayAllen> He clearly hasn't done majima everywhere
[3:57:43] <%linSP> hes holding back
[3:57:46] <PatchySouls> It would have been cool if Kiryu worked on an ATB level, like Final Fantasy
[3:57:49] <%TheBensonator_> Kiryu knows he needs to put you over at Yakoozie Kingdom
[3:57:51] <randomahole> at the end of the fight, he just gets dressed
[3:57:52] <+RaziWraith> Maybe he is weak against ice cuz his shirt is off.
[3:57:56] <Maleicus> you cant do combos in turn based
[3:57:57] <%ukokira> psaDab
[3:57:58] <%QueequegTheater> No finisher
[3:57:58] <%spoiledbadger> ice ice baby
[3:58:02] <%krispen_wa> Literally only does basic combos or one hits
[3:58:02] <skyentombment> HE DID THE KICK FROM THE COVER
[3:58:03] <%MisterRockett> Their level isn't their real level it represents how much they're holding back.
[3:58:04] <colzack_> hes not finishing any of his combos either
[3:58:13] <%hrbeck_> majima
[3:58:13] <Thepothero> cast gun
[3:58:14] <%h0wiewong> Wow
[3:58:14] <%tigerfang86> RESIST GUN
[3:58:19] <MarvelousMrD> i kinda wish he didnt take it so easy
[3:58:20] <+hollowwhirlwnd> Call Majima
[3:58:22] <%Strider222> KICK
[3:58:22] <%krispen_wa> Measly kick
[3:58:26] <$Cozy90> honerable bullets
[3:58:28] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Kiryu's only level 57 because he's holding back THAT hard.
[3:58:31] <+Omegasinnocence> He did not care
[3:58:32] <zachataxx> Kiryo would be LV 100 if he fought seriously
[3:58:33] <%TheBensonator_> smol kick
[3:58:35] <+RaziWraith> When did Eri get a freakin Assault Rifle in Japan???? WutFace
[3:58:36] <lem______> stop spamming hollow

[4:02:47] <%tigerfang86> y e s
[4:02:48] <Guardiansaiyan> @GigaSeifer Kiryu
[4:02:49] <%iosephe> Yes
[4:02:50] <%baka_sugoi> YES
[4:02:50] <%MrBorisMakarov> YES
[4:02:52] <%solracc25> Did they even fight
[4:02:53] <circular7> kiryu's fist always calms people down
[4:02:56] <%coreyyotto> That's fucking rich coming from Kiryu though
[4:02:58] <ZeeJiggle> Kiryu is REALLY good at beating people into a calm state.
[4:02:58] <%TheBensonator_> YEYEYE
[4:02:58] <BigMaximum> yes
[4:02:58] <%HedgehogGames1> Kiryu punched them one time each and won.
[4:02:59] <42nfl19> wait this was just a nero vs dante dmc4 fight
[4:03:00] <Remedy020> modCheck Eri?

[4:03:05] <%Jekado> THEN TIGERDROP
[4:03:05] <+loukemia83> @TheMattman1313 No games journalist played past chapter 3
[4:03:07] <%tigerfang86> YOU TOOK 6 GAMES TO LEARN THAT
[4:03:08] <%OswaldTheDog> you gon take his hand anytime soon ichi
[4:03:08] <%BoxNavy> kiryus sobering fists
[4:03:09] <Valkryna> kiryu teaches everyone a lesson with his fists
[4:03:11] <%TheWinged7> WHEN DID KIRYU GET THIS SMART?
[4:03:12] <+RowenCleric> oh my god... I just realized... this whole game is just a SUBSTORY to Kiryu!!!
[4:03:13] <%AlphaRayAllen> Vibecheck
[4:03:14] <parkslady> boy you best listen to the dragon of dojima
[4:03:14] <zachataxx> Sometimes, we just need our asses kicked once in a while
[4:03:15] <Daniel_Is_I> And then beat them with a bench
[4:03:15] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @PatStaresAt That was funny as fuck, but I honestly think it'd be cooler if that last bit actually happened and Ichiban actually did, like, give him a little bruise or something.
[4:03:15] <+Pharmakokinetic> how old is kiryu at this point
[4:03:16] <+Jaysky> @TheMattman1313 It wasn't in the running, and it's likely cause not every person on the board had played all Yakuza.
[4:03:17] <%missingangle> Kiryu calms people down... perhaps TOO calm. They stop moving and all
[4:03:17] <AMaidIndeed> shut up Kiryu, you never do that
[4:03:19] <DusK_The_Stray> This is just a side story for Kiryu
[4:03:19] <AllenDeadman> ayyyy
[4:03:19] <+fishteevee> @tigerfang86 YEAH BUT HE LEARNED THO
[4:03:21] <%televisedrevolting> This was a subquest for Kiryu.
[4:03:23] <+Seitine> I was able to take a damn shower in the time it took to beat his ass I even shaved my damn legs. LUL
[4:03:23] <%jorniev> KYRYU ALWAY LITERRALLY FIXES THINGS WITH HIS FISTS
[4:03:24] <tukds> now kiss

[4:03:26] <%TheBensonator_> Kiryu, the fucking philosopher
[4:03:27] <CoronaVirusIsOver> @Pharmakokinetic 51
[4:03:28] <Daemyx> Kiryu voice feels so out of place
[4:03:29] <Blank9> I'm most afraid of kiryu tiger dropping me, without me attacking him
[4:03:29] <Aeon_Offspring> HE'S HUGE
[4:03:29] <OneThousandTomatoes> kiryus in his 50s
[4:03:31] <circular7> touch passed
[4:03:32] <+Delenay> lol it was
[4:03:35] <Brunty023> @Pharmakokinetic Kiryu is 50 at this point
[4:03:37] <MarvelousMrD> but kiryu never did that he punched his problems away
[4:03:37] <%televisedrevolting> @dusk_the_stray SAME HAT
[4:03:39] <RyeBreadBakery> FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT KISS KISS KISS
[4:03:41] <R3c0n31> @TheWinged7 He raised a child
[4:03:42] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Now Kiryu is off to go play pocket circuit
[4:03:42] <%QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So how quickly did the fight actually take for Kiryu to kick all seven of their asses?
[4:03:44] <Chaosbringer21> this game has really made me want to go back and play the series
[4:03:44] <KirinoKosaka> What a fight
[4:03:45] <PsychoPearl> Kiryu is like 50
[4:03:48] <Monkeyweed21> SAVE
[4:03:49] <%h0wiewong> Plot twist, that dragon punch he did wasn't imaginary
[4:03:49] <%baka_sugoi> Kiryu sidequest complete

[4:03:53] <%R0bobot> Ichiban really said "I'll kill you!"
[4:03:53] <DusK_The_Stray> @televisedrevolting AYYY
[4:03:55] <%AlphaRayAllen> WIFE
[4:03:55] <%TheBensonator_> That's some peak storytelling right there
[4:03:56] <+RowenCleric> literally just a sub story to Kiryu, complete with motivational monologue
[4:03:57] <Remedy020> that was crazy good budget
[4:03:59] <Spagheddies> Oh shit thighs
[4:04:00] <+Shadowtalon77> FIND THE COMPUTER ROOM
[4:04:00] <Sulfur_Boride> Kiryu's 51, and still a god
[4:04:00] <%tigerfang86> SUPER HOT STILL
[4:04:01] <%Quigsies> This is definitely one of the the best games of the year
[4:04:04] <garbageheaphound> Kiryu can absolutely Tiger Drop you Pat
[4:04:05] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Kiryu's like 51 at this point.
[4:04:08] <Daniel_Is_I> Minority report?
[4:04:08] <%TheNewJapanGuy> Best girl
[4:04:09] <%MrBorisMakarov> MINORITY REPORT
[4:04:14] <Bryon_Youngblood> Unlike you, Kiryu, that can also be a strength of Ichiban's to wear his heart on his sleeves. Since even if you can be calm and shit a lot, it won't help if yoiu've been wrongewd. Sometimes... YOU GOTTA EXPLODE
[4:04:19] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Kiryu totally has the Tiger Drop.
[4:04:20] <darkspines520> Might as well start playing the sad substory piano music
[4:04:21] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> Kiryu totally heard the sad substory music when talking to Ichiban
[4:04:23] <%reonome> whats this minority report shit
[4:04:25] <Bryon_Youngblood> You bottle it too long, you end up miserable.
[4:04:26] <%Omegaanimus> Kiryu is headed to Dragon Kart

[4:04:38] <+TheBigO75> I love Kiryu's voice actor.
[4:04:44] <Bryon_Youngblood> @OneThousandTomatoesDoubt it.
[4:04:45] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @onethousandtomatoes not yet
[4:04:48] <%h0wiewong> Kiryu has not once introduced himslef
[4:04:51] <TyrianPurpleHaze> @A_Real_American_Trash_Can Oh my God, you're so right. The sad substory music was going off in his head that whole time he was talking.
[4:04:53] <tsnakesrule> @onethousandtomatoes no one there does
[4:04:54] <PsychoPearl> @onethousandtomatoes Probably not
[4:04:55] <mortificent> yeah, Kiryu does have the Tiger Drop and it fucking hurts
[4:05:04] <DestroyerPhoenix> couldn't happen to a nicer guy
[4:05:06] <%SuckerPunchSyd> He pulled a. “you dont get to know my name”
[4:05:09] <%reonome> killing his actual dad
[4:05:13] <CelestialCage> @h0wiewong hes supposed to be incognito

[4:05:35] <Sulfur_Boride> Huh. i'm starting to see a little more wrinkles on Kiryu's face
[4:05:35] <R3c0n31> Dont make ichiban remember
[4:05:36] <%baka_sugoi> Kiryu should have his jacket off like from the 6th game
[4:05:37] <%MrBorisMakarov> 'sorry'

[4:05:49] <%gnarly_memes_bro> The dragon of HUh what niw??
[4:05:51] <%NeedlesD> It's not like Saejima didn't call him the Dragon of Dojima earlier
[4:05:52] <%Deft_Thought> What cover? He's wearing the same shit he always does
[4:05:52] <gungniir_> The Fixer as in The Florist?
[4:05:59] <AlexDaGr8> i don't see how it's a cover when kiryu has been wearing the same suit for THIRTY FIVE YEARS
[4:06:02] <zachataxx> What is this "Dojima" you speak of?
[4:06:03] <%MisterRockett> With the Omi and Tojo dead Ichiban literally never has to ACTUALLY learn who Kiryu is.
[4:06:05] <TyrianPurpleHaze> The Dragon of Some Place, Don't Worry About It

[4:07:12] <%TheMattman1313> MAJIMA could kill Sawashiro
[4:07:12] <seaechiowai> apparently he's not blending in so well, actually

[4:07:28] <%Ner234> Oh ichiban...
[4:07:29] <GigaSeifer> He ordered a hit on the man he thought was his dad
[4:07:29] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[4:07:30] <circular7> nothing
[4:07:30] <CelestialCage> He tried to kill his fake deas
[4:07:32] <%ElectricEmissary> he'll epstein him
[4:07:32] <VritraReiRei> Obviously Kappa
[4:07:33] <+Jaysky> Shush Ichi
[4:07:34] <PsychoPearl> Exactly LUL
[4:07:35] <+PenmanLupine> Ichiban is a shonen idiot
[4:07:35] <hassanico2> LUL
[4:07:36] <%tigerfang86> HE KILLED HIS DAD EARLIER
[4:07:36] <%Dunmarkh> He'll kill his dad twice
[4:07:36] <Remedy020> Because Plot :)
[4:07:37] <zachataxx> Name any master disguise assassin, and that's Mirror Face
[4:07:38] <%AtlasMcCoy> True
[4:07:38] <+Jaysky> Oh my god Ichi
[4:07:39] <%Piemono> He would want to kill him more if anything
[4:07:40] <%natjen8> Ichi showing that 1 INT
[4:07:40] <+Grayhammatter> ichi, you are so dumb
[4:07:40] <%iosephe> When you put it like that...
[4:07:41] <%oAznoUta> flawless logic
[4:07:41] <CelestialCage> Ichi
[4:07:42] <%medusasghost> LUL
[4:07:43] <sentientvin> beautiful sentence
[4:07:44] <circular7> Pat's right
[4:07:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Wait is that the same assassin from Judgment?
[4:07:44] <R3c0n31> Is he already a member of the party? if he can disguise as anyone?
[4:07:44] <%baka_sugoi> aoki psaBig BAD
[4:07:48] <%Grimlockfly> Party500 Ichiban 'has heard' of Majima, but literally one of his Chairmans isn't ringing any bells.
[4:07:50] <follyofjolly> MORE power
[4:07:50] <%Grimlockfly> Grimlockfly's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[4:07:50] <%YakumoYomi> ”Well...one more dad to kill."
[4:07:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> that sentence
[4:07:52] <%greasypete00> hes such a himbo its hilarious
[4:07:54] <+xeros720> look, i know that's the actual plot, but god damn that sounds idiotic
[4:07:54] <sponsoredviewer910> yes ichi
[4:07:54] <primarch_lupercal> THINK ICHIBAN
[4:07:55] <%Dr00_PhD> I am so deep into this Yakuza shit sthat sentence actually made sense
[4:07:55] <definitelynotnero> Ichi is too pure for this world
[4:07:57] <GigaSeifer> "Aoki, you killed the wrong dad!"
[4:07:57] <watts121> Aoki: DOUBLE KILL!
[4:08:00] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> to be fair Ichi just fought Kiryu and got the crap beat outta him
[4:08:00] <zachataxx> Ichiban lost both of his dads, Masato killed both of his dads
[4:08:00] <%tigerfang86> LOOK AT THE COLOR CONTRAST
[4:08:02] <Remedy020> I'm the DAD captain now
[4:08:03] <+loukemia83> Ichi is optimistic til the end
[4:08:03] <%tigerfang86> THE COLOR CONTRAST THO
[4:08:04] <Jnkolm> He would be thrilled at getting to kill his dad twice
[4:08:05] <%gnarly_memes_bro> EVERY STAR IN THE SKY IS A NEW DAD I MUST KILL
[4:08:05] <%iosephe> Pat: "I'll kill all my dads"
[4:08:06] <%Piemono> Given what a shit dad Jo was, Aoki would double kill him
[4:08:06] <TyrianPurpleHaze> Seriously Ichiban, he ALREADY thinks he killed his own dad, why the fuck would he care?
[4:08:07] <%BoxNavy> nah
[4:08:09] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> so uh his brain may still be booting up

[4:08:17] <%ElectricEmissary> I'm too OPO

[4:08:18] <%h0wiewong> He's not allowed to be a main character anymore
[4:08:18] <%hrbeck_> "I'm overleveled"
[4:08:19] <BigMaximum> "Nah"
[4:08:19] <%reonome> kiryu is too OP to be in the party

[4:08:25] <$Skelemungus> jermaPluto

[4:09:25] <%Deft_Thought> "If I keep going and Haruka finds out I'm alive, I'd actually have to show up in her life and be a father figure. Instead, I make no effort to disguise myself and beat up Yakuza."

[4:09:57] <SGrim> This 56 year old is telling this 40 year old that hes not in his physical prime yet... Ok Boomer.
[4:09:59] <circular7> THE POWER OF FRIENDSHIP

[4:10:56] <nolanhero> we'll see him tomorrow
[4:10:57] <R3c0n31> She want tha no sex dick
[4:10:57] <T_Sasquatch> kiryu will never not be in a yakuza game
[4:10:57] <+toastedalmond1222> i'd be ok with him being a random superboss, but never get involved in the story
[4:10:57] <%Kataguro> Oh she wantin some fuck
[4:10:58] <colzack_> Don't want Kiryu as the new Amon?
[4:10:58] <%ElectricEmissary> kiryu was a ghost the whole time

[4:10:58] <Spagheddies> Oh you'll see him again. You'll see.
[4:10:58] <CelestialCage> Kreygasm Kiryuchan
[4:10:59] <%BoxNavy> hes totally a poundmate isnt he
[4:11:00] <%tigerfang86> SPLOOOOOOOSH
[4:11:00] <%coreyyotto> Kiryu was the ghost porn all along
[4:11:00] <NitronStreams> "Kiryu died on the way back to his home planet"
[4:11:01] <%missingangle> Gief LUL
[4:11:01] <%kewlmyc> Watch he show up in every game
[4:11:01] <+swid_harry> not in a million years
[4:11:01] <+Jaromero435> ISHIODA
[4:11:06] <seaechiowai> shouldn't but will
[4:11:06] <garbageheaphound> NEXT TIME WE SHOW UP KIRYU SHOULD BE EIGHTY AND IS SOMEHOW THE STRONGEST
[4:11:06] <mighty_fine_trousers> Ok forreal that upskirt shot
[4:11:09] <Morbidmort> Kiryu teaches the new guy to fight in 8
[4:11:09] <tonfirean> "Also, did you see how he's a dragon?"
[4:11:09] <%HedgehogGames1> Really we shouldn't have seen him in this game either.
[4:11:09] <tsnakesrule> Kiryu won't be in 8 unless the orphans get destroyed
[4:11:09] <%weissguard> Giefy snore
[4:11:09] <VritraReiRei> "Never see him again" PROCEEDS TO POUNDMATES
[4:11:09] <dinnydanny777> I like the idea that he has a stupid cameo in every game LUL
[4:11:10] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> See you next time space yakuzie
[4:11:10] <Sunstalker> I want to see him again on a tourist trip with majima
[4:11:12] <parkslady> Kiryu just taking a ghost break that's all he'll be back
[4:11:12] <%miguelrod777> sploosh
[4:11:14] <%murderof_crows> Women still want him
[4:11:15] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> time to fuck a bitch up

[4:11:18] <%radda343> how do her heels work on that floor
[4:11:19] <+Delenay> nope
[4:11:20] <+Seitine> Ah, that's just life.
[4:11:22] <%baka_sugoi> ghost hunters
[4:11:23] <%A_Real_American_Trash_Can> The only time he'll lose is when he comes back in Yakuza 10 as an 80 year old, and even then you won't really win.
[4:11:23] <Djinnazz> 56 years old and still the strobgest man in the land.
[4:11:25] <%mister___doctor> That guy can see yo her skirt from down there
[4:11:29] <AMaidIndeed> she's also wearing a skirt on a metal grate platform
[4:11:30] <Bryon_Youngblood> How about just letting him sit on the sidelines? Reall yin the long run, it worked inm some ways for Dante in Devil May Cry 4 or 5, and it's more fitting in the long run too with Nero stepping up to the plate as the new protagonist.
[4:11:31] <sponsoredviewer910> bet he loves working on the lower floor
[4:11:31] <+Delenay> what difference would it be, day or night?
[4:11:33] <zachataxx> What if Kiryu appears just as a boss in a coliseum or whatever bonus minigame, and nobody comments on it
[4:11:49] <%tigerfang86> he'd KILL ME
[4:11:49] <%AlphaRayAllen> NOPE

[4:11:53] <tonfirean> @radda343 that reminds me of the end of Armor of God 2: Operation Condor
[4:11:54] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I always ask how the fuck women in games be wearing heels on grating.

[4:12:11] <gungniir_> mike tyson's fabled tither throp
[4:12:13] <+swid_harry> I would explode
[4:12:13] <SGrim> Old Ass Mike Tyson probably doesn't want to fight a 24 year old boxer though.
[4:12:13] <+GingerStrawhat> End of the chapter is coming up!
[4:12:15] <dinnydanny777> Some boxers already go until they're like 40 as well
[4:12:16] <%rdark_ksu> can it be a cooking fight?
[4:12:16] <+Seitine> Also as a chick, I'd just fucking die instantly LUL
[4:12:18] <+Plus_On_Black> we all getting waxed
[4:12:18] <DKDiamantes> If you paid me enough I'd take that ass whopping
[4:12:19] <%goose_attack_almanac> It'd be that discussion of How Many people does it take to fight a gorilla
[4:12:19] <%weissguard> Kiryu is turning 51 this year, for those unaware.
[4:12:21] <+Private_Donghead> If it were mike tyson and 20 randos from the chat all in that a room, I'm still convinced mike would win
[4:12:22] <luciluxlu0> he could fight all of chat without sweating
[4:12:22] <T_Sasquatch> he might be 50 but he's still mike tyson
[4:12:22] <BurdRightsActivist> look at this fucking DUNGEON
[4:12:22] <UlriktheSlayer1> just cuz you old dont mean you cant kick someone's shit in
[4:12:23] <R3c0n31> Fucking one punch man theme starts playing agaisnt plebs like us against that motherfucker
[4:12:23] <DusK_The_Stray> I'd do it knowing full well he'd probably kill me
[4:12:26] <Spagheddies> Honestly, I'm rather fond of my ears. Both of them.
[4:12:30] <Morbidmort> Is Kiryu the Japanese Mike Tyson?
[4:12:30] <%weissguard> *Ingame, that is.
[4:12:32] <%patriotrenegade> I bet Mike isn’t faster than my gun.

[4:12:43] <%gnarly_memes_bro> I wouldn't need to fight Mike Tyson I've got good weed
[4:12:43] <xbb1024> I wonder if Mike Tyson gets requests from people to punch them
