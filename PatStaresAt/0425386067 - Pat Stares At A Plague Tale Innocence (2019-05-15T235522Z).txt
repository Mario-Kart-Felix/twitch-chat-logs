[0:40:50] <spinalwizard> Fire Rats vs Vampires LET'S GO!!!
[0:40:50] <lionmanguy> They had real trials for people digging up corpses because they thought diraah was caused by vampires
[0:40:50] <%laserbeaming> YEAH IT DID

[0:40:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Werewolves
[0:40:51] <xeros720> vampire rats
[0:40:51] <gustavozxd> it's cool that they don't know what it is

[1:29:26] <$Brother_Coduss> david killed a fucking giant with a rock

[1:29:31] <%connos_livereview> david was a sans enfant terribles tho
[1:29:31] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, but Goliath didn't wear much armor
[1:29:32] <%Gogogolem> slings are pretty easy to use.
[1:29:33] <+redstonej> david was a dumbass
[1:29:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Bows are pretty easy to make
[1:29:34] <%RioGascar> sling? Just put some rocks in
[1:29:34] <+jacobloomer> David didn't have arrows
[1:29:35] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ver pretty
[1:29:36] <lotharrio> Slings are easier to use, are less prone to wear, have easier to acquired ammunition and over short distances are super deadly.

[1:29:56] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Slings are better in theory, but they don't do as much against armor and are kinda hard to learn to use
[1:29:57] <SaintSadistic> Yout taste is shit and you should feel bad. -_-
[1:29:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Were arrows invented in 1985 too? @angriestpat
[1:30:01] <simulationbard> David had the power of God and anime on his side

[1:33:49] <xeros720> walked right past a prompt
[1:33:50] <GoldeNOVA> But also there weren't enough doctors, Plague Doctors were not "doctors"
[1:33:51] <+AlphaAgito> Gotta make sure all your colors are balanced
[1:33:52] <@lewdskeletor13> They tried their best ok?
[1:33:53] <%spiritofmojave> A little blood-letting to lessen the plague :)
[1:33:53] <simulationbard> Hit them with a stick
[1:33:56] <+BubbaRands> Stomach ache? Leeches!
[1:33:59] <+Shaggnar> In fact those doctors openly mocked the guy who found out washing your hands caused less people to die
[1:34:00] <dukenux> "Did you know Mervury is good for you"
[1:34:01] <BigNerdSam> Anyone else follow Plaguebot on Twitter?

[1:34:13] <%DeaconBluesClues> the 4 humors represent trickster, giunslinger, swordmaster-
[1:34:14] <jerkhov_> your psych degree is showing
[1:34:14] <worldbrand> don't you know the human body is basically just plumbing?
[1:34:15] <%Wallabri> Black bile, yellow bile, blood and phlegm

[1:34:30] <corepercentlives> yeah remove the bad blood
[1:34:32] <+Ragnarok1890> this sick little boy can run pretty good and pretty long
[1:34:33] <+BoomerTiro> The sudden population explosion in the past century is because we only started doing medicine mostly correct in the past century and double human lifespan and brought infant mortality down to a percentage
[1:34:34] <+ChaosVulpes> obtain AXE
[1:34:35] <mayorrev> WHAT'S THAT SMELL
[1:34:35] <%deviljhojho94> crikIQ

[1:34:46] <ooblag> On the plus side, using leeches is the most occasionally useful way of bleeding people, since they cleen the shit out of wounds
[1:34:46] <+BlockingDisabled> As far as healing went, they were pretty bad, but apparently they fought plague suprisingly well.

[1:36:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is a intresting game dev wise
[1:36:06] <42nfl19> Soap originated from animal fats I think, super old stuff @AngriestPat
[1:36:07] <alexandrecau> accusatory pARLOR
[1:36:08] <jerkhov_> living room was created by the tv
[1:36:11] <%jiin6> Drinks in the PALOR apatLiz
[1:36:12] <%ThePuddingDead> dad of boy, no contest
[1:36:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> my favorite thing is that 'soap' used to be animal fat mixed with sand and flowers.
[1:36:14] <%tuesti> WHAT
[1:36:15] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> They still do that
[1:36:15] <$Brother_Coduss> for a wake, yes

[1:36:28] <%Ranryu692> It's called a wake
[1:36:28] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> puppet them like a muppet
[1:36:28] <%puhff> I mean, the soap line from Fight Club is pretty accurate
[1:36:30] <%wolfofsound> a wake
[1:36:30] <Jontman42> Is this another Pat fact that's actually wildly inaccurate
[1:36:30] <%connos_livereview> thats bullshit but i believe it
[1:36:31] <%duneblythe> that sounds cool as hell
[1:36:31] <%Typhaeon> Nowadays they call it the F Room

[1:36:33] <twistedj3ster> @Rincewind1998 Yeah, it's not the corridor shooter I'm fiending for, plus it's newer, was hoping I missed a gem
[1:36:33] <narusao> dress up yer dead gramma in funny hats
[1:36:33] <%spiritofmojave> That was a popular rite in filial piety in China I think
[1:36:35] <%jiin6> Stinky bodies in the palor
[1:36:35] <+BubbaRands> This is actually still true in some cultures
[1:36:35] <mar_krow> Take picture with them too
[1:36:38] <Claxter_> The kid is dressed like a dragon quest character. He probably learns Sizzle later on
[1:36:39] <starotter70> And it was
[1:36:40] <simulationbard> They think that bleeding might have been how Gorge Washington died. Officially it was because of a fever but the doctor who treated him apparently let out like a liter of blood and some historians are pretty sure that was the real cause, or at the very lest a major factor
[1:36:41] <thegreenbenis> I believe it was also to make sure you were dead. @AngriestPat
[1:36:44] <%laserbeaming> That sounds like not very sanitary
[1:36:44] <%Ranryu692> it's called a wake, I was at one today
[1:36:46] <%ThePuddingDead> it WAS barbaric
[1:36:46] <+BoomerTiro> "this thing everyone does is barbaric"

[1:37:36] <%nekodelic> nobody expects the inquisition
[1:37:38] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Fun fact Pat, The catholic church caused the plague to be worse, The pope declared a black cat the second incarnation of satan it escaped and catholics mass murdered black cats for three decades making the cat population in europe insanely low making rats thrive.
[1:37:38] <SirBrawler18> We didnt expect them
[1:37:39] <cosmictrashcan> South america still does it
[1:37:39] <Badgerconda_> Ireland is basically stuck in the middle ages, though.

[1:37:54] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Thats a baller name
[1:37:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @GohanEgret Skeletons aren't corpses. They're skeletons.
[1:37:57] <%Typhaeon> Typical to have a family event with an open casket before the funeral

[1:38:49] <%ThatOneGameTester> None
[1:38:49] <SirBrawler18> Now THATS a Turbofumble
[1:38:51] <%Laecerelius> Yeah, because they noticed that the plague would be in places with lots of cats which were trying to kill the rats which were spreading the fleas which were spreading the plague
[1:38:53] <thegreenbenis> *Tips fedora*
[1:38:54] <jerkhov_> elmo is just half black would he be okay?
[1:38:55] <Mr_Strut> Thanks Obama!

[1:38:57] <+jacobloomer> Can we get an F in the chat for all the black cats
[1:38:57] <ShichiNoBushi> Ring around the rosie; Pocket full of posies...
[1:38:58] <dzdandcnfsd> Plague was spread by fleas so dogs and cats also carried it
[1:39:00] <+BoomerTiro> Death of Cats, Anti-semitism, and an entire host of other things all pretty much worked together to make the plague wipe out everyone but poland
[1:39:00] <%TDotGoat> ok, but cats are allies of satan..
[1:39:01] <vonmaultke> the 4th crusade LUL black cats must die
[1:39:01] <%DeaconBluesClues> FUN FACT similar shit happened during the great leap forward, with Chinese peasants killing random birds because they blamed them for disease
[1:39:01] <+cahv123> Well this is a time when people though maggots spontaneously sprouted from rotten things.
[1:39:01] <%nofestu2> it was a comedy of errors really
[1:39:02] <dakuman13> With stupid-ass haircuts like that, do you expect any less?
[1:39:03] <%puhff> There also used to be 2 popes
[1:39:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's not the Pope's fault people were largely uneducated and scared.

[1:39:28] <+Shaggnar> Before the split in the church if I remember right
[1:39:29] <shackbox> jews were spared because they FUCKING BATHED, but then the catholics killed them
[1:39:30] <+MusouMiko> england had it the worst because it was 1) cramped 2) full of shitty idiots

[1:39:44] <ItsKitKat_> @AngriestPat Another fun fact! cities such as Milan and Douai in Flanders, were completely untouched by the black plague due to the merchants from the east bringing in their healthy lifestyles
[1:39:44] <%MagickBurritoh> Oh no

[1:42:03] <+YabbaTroll> probably woulndt be high enough pop density
[1:42:03] <%SaltyDongs> I would set myself on fire
[1:42:03] <Dreigun> that mass of rats effect is really cool
[1:42:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat. Rats wouldn't have spread as fast
[1:42:05] <%Gogogolem> No
[1:42:05] <thegreenbenis> This looks really nad.
[1:42:05] <sirrice77> invention of flame?
[1:42:05] <%crimsonharvest> This many rats only exist because of urbanization in the first place so no
[1:42:06] <%Hammerknife> @AngriestPat no its just video game
[1:42:06] <+TheSaintJohn> this is super dramatized
[1:42:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Well we wouldn't have ships pat
[1:42:06] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> We linked the First Flame and won
[1:42:06] <jerkhov_> these rat tracking animations are hillarious
[1:42:07] <%afronooch> uuuhhhh
[1:42:07] <Lunatyr_> The invention of fire?
[1:42:07] <+justianxix> Rats would rule the world
[1:42:07] <mattskitchen67> flame wasn't invented until 1832
[1:42:08] <%connos_livereview> its ok cos of the first flame tho
[1:42:08] <NickHatesSnow> I wouldnt call it stupid to be scared of being burnt alive
[1:42:08] <dukenux> nah
[1:42:08] <$El_Desperad0> Yes
[1:42:08] <Hydrapissed> yep we invented flame
[1:42:09] <SaintSadistic> "The invention of flame". Let's all let that sink in.
[1:42:09] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Plague watching Plague Tale.
[1:42:10] <+Lazyjoules> Pat, we weren't close enough to eacheother before fire
[1:42:11] <Ominnous> New Mexico had a strain of the Bubonic Plague a few years ago
[1:42:11] <+Shaggnar> No, the rates just make all the rules
[1:42:12] <Deazleweasle> From what I have learned, Poland was one of the only countries in mainland Europe that was spared from the brunt of the plague due to the country's plain-like topography.
[1:42:12] <mar_krow> Yes
[1:42:13] <+DrPoxx> prior to fire? the first invention?
[1:42:13] <NerdSquid> think about it bud
[1:42:13] <RupanSen> Gwyn, Inventor of Flame
[1:42:14] <Jeemukun> wouldn't be enough humans around in the first place for that to do anything
[1:42:14] <Louie_Salmon> I mean, no, the rats weren't actually like this
[1:42:14] <%Laecerelius> There wouldn't be enough humans to spread a plague like that that early on
[1:42:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Louie_Salmon The plague is spread by "blood" rats are carriers not spreaders. Fleas spread plague
[1:42:14] <%topendbuzz> but rats did not live near us back then
[1:42:15] <dakuman13> Had our ancestors not linked the first flame, we would be mega fucked yes
[1:42:15] <mar_krow> No
[1:42:15] <Caidezes> THE INVENTION OF FIRE
[1:42:15] <Us3rr> invention of fire
[1:42:15] <%Plankman> we'd be skaven to adapt to our plaguemasters
[1:42:16] <ooblag> The Plague wouldn't spread for shit without humanity and urbanization
[1:42:16] <simulationbard> tHE TORCH IS LIT. THE PATH IS CLEAR. WE REQUIRE ONLY THE STRENGTH TO FOLLOW IT
[1:42:17] <%spiritofmojave> You're thinking too into it
[1:42:17] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The invention of flame...?
[1:42:17] <%TDotGoat> some people are naturally immune to the plague
[1:42:17] <%spacehouse> FIRE INVENTED DURING 1500s
[1:42:19] <$Valdorick> Prior to several 10s of thousands of years ago? MAYBE
[1:42:19] <$El_Desperad0> He said before the invention of flame, chat
[1:42:19] <+cvp5127> i mean the sun exist
[1:42:19] <scritchez> when rats move like liquid, i'd say it's a big problem
[1:42:19] <dzdandcnfsd> Ratking is the final boss?
[1:42:19] <BigNerdSam> Man, these rat physics are rad.
[1:42:19] <autcetera> Nah, we wouldn't be urbanized
[1:42:19] <PerrinIsDead> Eh asia was fine
[1:42:19] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat roughly 30% of victims lived regardless, so no.
[1:42:21] <%Edgy_Macaroon> there would still be cats to hunt
[1:42:21] <starotter70> Before flame, yes
[1:42:23] <%RioGascar> The invention of flame...OH THANK GOD FOR PROMETHISUS
[1:42:23] <MatheusSipolatti> This is totally a Vampire the MAsuqerado Dark Ages games, but secretly
[1:42:23] <%arcaderabbit48> Those rats look awful, their just clipping out of existence through the wall
[1:42:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Infection exists because we gather together @AngriestPat
[1:42:24] <%Laecerelius> The plague was horrible because of cities existing
[1:42:25] <%Plankman> jermaRat
[1:42:26] <%Kreegmeyer> Vermintide 3 got spooky damn
[1:42:27] <%TIME_PUNCHER> shh don't ask questions
[1:42:28] <worldbrand> You know, the invention of fire, inspired by the discovery of Dark Souls 1 in 40,000 BC
[1:42:28] <+BoomerTiro> Fire doesn;t really stop disease and rats do NOT behave like this
[1:42:28] <dukenux> before the flame we wiuldnt have trade ships
[1:42:28] <+miyoles> your talking about the origins of humanity
[1:42:29] <%maskedriderhero> These rats are fucking monsters
[1:42:30] <%connos_livereview> flame was actually invented in 1985
[1:42:31] <+MusouMiko> there wouldn't be enough civilization clustered up regardless
[1:42:31] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Louie_Salmon fleas or ticks
[1:42:32] <corepercentlives> Good we invented air and water too
[1:42:33] <+Noxybaru> I mean before the invention of flame people didn't really live in sprawling settlements so it would've killed a community or two and then fucked off

[1:43:04] <Rotabrutsama> living lava
[1:43:04] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Throw grenades at the rats
[1:43:05] <person181> 2x4s burn for a bit, sucks you can't use them
[1:43:05] <Hydrapissed> Holy
[1:43:07] <+Reveresao> get eatten pat
[1:43:07] <starotter70> Are there any good films about the Plague?
[1:43:07] <%puhff> I invented Flame in 1985 before I was born
[1:43:08] <shackbox> go back there was a letter
[1:43:10] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> BONES
[1:43:10] <alrobot2014> that shit might as well be a river full of spiders
[1:43:11] <%Daidis> did rats actually do this
[1:43:11] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> paige no
[1:43:12] <Thalchampz> SICK
[1:43:13] <+darkParable> what the hell did i just find out
[1:43:13] <%Plankman> skellmo!
[1:43:13] <+Spec7re> not even bleached
[1:43:13] <%MagickBurritoh> They all are
[1:43:13] <jerkhov_> skelmo
[1:43:14] <sonofthedeepsouth> Nice
[1:43:14] <+cahv123> yep, if plague had hit before fire was common place would have been way before now and there would have been by far fewer humans. It would have wiped humanity off the surface of the earth.
[1:43:14] <$Brother_Coduss> WORLD IS A FUCK
[1:43:14] <shackbox> there was a thing!
[1:43:14] <Ion_Laser> WutFace WutFace
[1:43:14] <%Lillowh> Don't give up skeleton
[1:43:15] <Us3rr> holy shit
[1:43:15] <corepercentlives> basically kryll from gears
[1:43:15] <%GohanEgret> paige is INTRIGUED
[1:43:16] <Pyrrhus90> papa nurgle loves you
[1:43:16] <CrypticMochi> brownSPOOKY
[1:43:16] <+g8rhead> Rat Piranhas
[1:43:16] <%nofestu2> the floor is disease
[1:43:17] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Don't give up skeleton.
[1:43:17] <%duneblythe> lava is less dangerous
[1:43:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> JUST LOOK AT THE BONES!
[1:43:18] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat I don't think rats existed before man discovered fire
[1:43:18] <Taffer85> UPGRADE
[1:43:19] <%afronooch> the hunger
[1:43:20] <worldbrand> rats are dermestid beetles, don't you know?
[1:43:20] <%laserbeaming> Impressive how two monks kept all these torches and sconces lit
[1:43:20] <dukenux> sbfpVita
[1:43:21] <mar_krow> It is
[1:43:22] <%spiritofmojave> Paige interest PIQUED
[1:43:22] <Bimbort> Love the ~rat tech~. They flow in a really sick way
[1:43:23] <SaintSadistic> Ah, good old fantasy piranha-rats.
[1:43:23] <%MelBrooksKA> Paige is getting so porked up right now
[1:43:23] <%Zundelle> the skeleton is freed
[1:43:25] <%Ranryu692> it's worse than lava, it chases you
[1:43:26] <%anAngryHamster> rats, the piranhas of the land
[1:43:26] <@lewdskeletor13> MY SKELETAL BRETHREN
[1:43:27] <ShichiNoBushi> Also diseases spreading from animals to humans. They kill humans so bad because they aren't adapted to them, and a parasite would be at a disadvantage if it killed its host.
[1:43:27] <%wolfofsound> where did you come from paige
[1:43:29] <autcetera> This is Matt's kinda game yeah?
[1:43:29] <t0hub0hu> btw rats also naw bones for the marrow
[1:43:29] <%Faustgesicht> picked. the. fuck. clean
[1:43:29] <aimlesshealer> Go back and oogle that skeleton
[1:43:29] <BigNerdSam> Man, bubonic plague really makes rats hungry.
[1:43:29] <%skizzuto> not a very charismatic skeleton
[1:43:29] <%Swampykins> Getting some Metroid Echos vibes.
[1:43:30] <clonexsniperx> land piranhas
[1:43:30] <HeadsHeldHigh> Paige actively helping rats create skeletons
[1:43:30] <%AncelDeLambert> is sulphur a crafting material? Because if so FUCK having a cap!
[1:43:32] <%mastertwin2> What's really crazy is that most horrible diseases only exist because of huge shit-covered cities like London or Paris
[1:43:32] <person181> rat ladder time
[1:43:32] <SirBrawler18> Rats aint playing around
[1:43:32] <$Valdorick> The Great Horned One hungers
[1:43:33] <+Mittensbro> The floor is lava, but the lava is actually rats
[1:43:34] <Us3rr> the EYES
[1:43:35] <+Evitron1> this is the WORST
[1:43:35] <dakuman13> Were rats always privy to human flesh?
[1:43:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> fucking yikes man
[1:43:36] <sonofthedeepsouth> The floor is fucking is rats is scary enough
[1:43:37] <%tebari> tebari subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! Have you noticed that the rat swarm behaves like a liquid?
[1:43:37] <$Brother_Coduss> THEY'RE EVERYWHERE
[1:43:38] <deafmutelaughing> so do the rats eat people or give them the plague? seems like conflicting narratives here
[1:43:39] <gustavozxd> so Paige is the one commanding the rats
[1:43:41] <%crimsonharvest> without fire there was no way for as many humans as is required to spread a plague like happened in this case
[1:43:43] <+agentnuma> the sound design in this game is real good in a horrifying way
[1:43:43] <%ForgetfulUthanasiast> All it takes is one
[1:43:44] <+Spec7re> Man Dishonored is a cakewalk compared to this
[1:43:45] <+Rolandknight> @angriestpat is this a good buy and we all should do the same?
[1:43:46] <NickHatesSnow> If it was lava you couldny stand near it
[1:43:47] <%PaladinDupre> how would you even fight that many rats? A shotgun isnt enough
[1:43:47] <ooblag> Man, this is the weirdest Metroid Prime 2 mod I've ever seen
[1:43:48] <MajorCheri> I've seen this around and have been interested. Is it straight up horror or?
[1:43:51] <Taffer85> upgrade to get that sulfur
[1:43:51] <RoboXGP> people sleeping together spreads plague
[1:43:51] <shackbox> there's crafting?
[1:43:52] <+darkParable> i want to see a rat king in this
[1:43:52] <Louie_Salmon> @frostedzaibatsu Buts fleas/ticks would be on the rats, right? So functionally it's the rats
[1:43:54] <dukenux> when do you fight the King of Rats in this game
[1:43:54] <$SGrim> Thankfully rats can't climb... wait woopsHyper
[1:43:55] <$Big_King_Coconut> sulfur is a component of gunpowder
[1:43:55] <%ares92822> Land Piranha
[1:43:58] <MrPwng3> what all i miss
[1:43:59] <%duneblythe> you can run across lava
[1:43:59] <$Brother_Coduss> wheres molotovs when you need them
[1:44:00] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Hey chat. I watched a nature documentary. Flocks of birds in the wild in plains areas can do this to a Zebra FOR REAL, WITHIN 6 HOURS.
[1:44:00] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> hype
[1:44:00] <meermadon> I hope someone gets overrun by rats and comically turned into a skeleton in like 2 seconds
[1:44:01] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, bullshit, being able to carry 6 at once at most is bullshit
[1:44:02] <MrPwng3> just got in
[1:44:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Okay so this game is officially the worst and it's giving me the anxious.
[1:44:02] <%ThatOneGameTester> rats are so much worse of an apocalypse than zombies
[1:44:04] <%TIME_PUNCHER> the first flame saved us from plague
[1:44:05] <%puhff> This seems like a streach...
[1:44:06] <%Plankman> this music is that good crepy shit
[1:44:07] <Calamity2007> So is this game bad?
[1:44:08] <brows_> Ah can’t play in China
[1:44:08] <+democrazyyy> im glad I caught this in time to witness the first rat part cause man, when pat described this game on the podcast it sounded nuts
[1:44:12] <%RioGascar> Look at this video game shit
[1:44:14] <%theactualjimbo> theactualjimbo subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[1:44:33] <thegreenbenis> Rats are smarter than pat.
[1:44:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Saltpeter? Incoming gunpowder?
[1:44:33] <sonofthedeepsouth> NOISE
[1:44:35] <+Samsquanch> did pat just say fire isn't natural light
[1:44:35] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Hes the Rat King
[1:44:36] <SaintSadistic> "Flame is not natural light." -Pat Esquire.
[1:44:37] <+FrostedZaibatsu> @Louie_Salmon but saying they are the sole purpose IS misleading

[1:44:46] <Maids4lyfe> sacrifice him to satan
[1:44:46] <$Notalza> cheer1000 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 If you read the Metro 2033 book they describe a whole Metro station being consumed by a ocean of rats that flow in like water.

[1:45:23] <CriticKitten> Even in the past, girls don't have pockets. :(
[1:45:24] <%arcaderabbit48> @DraxTD Just replace mushroom zombies with rates
[1:45:24] <%AncelDeLambert> FEED them

[1:45:33] <42nfl19> distraction bag
[1:45:33] <%Laecerelius> I feel like once this amount of rats existed they'd just eat eachother
[1:45:34] <Louie_Salmon> @frostedzaibatsu Fair enough, yeah. I guess literally any animal was part of the problem
[1:45:35] <sonofthedeepsouth> Improvise
[1:45:36] <+jacobloomer> I do recommend the metro 2033 book
[1:45:36] <%spiritofmojave> D:

[1:45:46] <%Plankman> Steamed Hams
[1:45:47] <mayorrev> @angriestpat you think this is gonna have God of War levels of family bonding?
[1:45:47] <scritchez> straight up alien noises
[1:45:47] <reonome> JESUS CHRIST
[1:45:49] <Dorigard> I've seen this enough of this game to know how rad it is
[1:45:49] <jerkhov_> who could ever forget dear rat boy
[1:45:50] <+ChaosVulpes> Mmmmm, steamed hams!
[1:45:50] <sosuke5> Steamed hams
[1:45:51] <ooblag> Mmmmm, plagued hams
[1:45:51] <JayEarly> Same strings as Dishonored rats
[1:45:51] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> RAT TECH
[1:45:52] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> RAT TECH
[1:45:52] <+Plaxer> HAM
[1:45:53] <Jontman42> Liquid rats
[1:45:53] <SpaceGuntank> RAT TECH
[1:45:54] <+agentnuma> RAT TECH
[1:45:55] <%AllYouCanYeet> that ham gets the rats fuckin porked up
[1:45:55] <%Kataguro> Steamed Hams but it assists against the Rat Plague
[1:45:56] <%AncelDeLambert> the violin sting when they run is great
[1:45:57] <%Plankman> this game is pretty darn cool
[1:45:57] <%crimsonharvest> HAM TECH
[1:45:59] <dakuman13> I like that the music goes with the rays
[1:45:59] <MrPwng3> josuke you need to shoot the rats

[1:45:59] <Dr_Mooose> Days Gone eat your heart out
[1:46:01] <Ocaz> just jump
[1:46:02] <Inebriateddonut> Interesting choice to go for a gritty atmosphere in this ratatouille adaptation
[1:46:02] <$i_am_therydon> they're hungry for those GAMS
[1:46:03] <%NWR_James> BIG RAT TEK
[1:46:04] <gustavozxd> a flamethrower would be nice right about now
[1:46:07] <+Shaggnar> My favorite thing that happened with the Plague was how it got to Norway on a single ship that all the crew died and it floated around the baltic sea for years before washing ashore and a flood of rats came off of the ship
[1:46:07] <Claxter_> takes them longer to eat a ham then a man
[1:46:09] <worldbrand> she said it! she said the title of the-- wait, wrong game
[1:46:10] <%Hammerknife> i had rats in the house i bought. one treatment of vikane cleared them all and we swept a bunch of dead baby rats out from the crawlspace
[1:46:10] <+BubbaRands> Rat tech
[1:46:12] <%connos_livereview> this days gone and war z with the swarm era
[1:46:12] <%Plankman> even if the rest of the game sucks, like, it's got enough to be good
[1:46:13] <+darkParable> wait 'salpeter'? isnt it saltpeter
[1:46:14] <imshadow_35> basically like rats from Dishonored
[1:46:16] <Professor_Dr_Muffins> Man. Days gone was so proud of this, meanwhile this game is busy becoming a sleeper hit.
[1:46:17] <Lunatyr_> Days Gone cancelled for Rat game
[1:46:17] <$Brother_Coduss> SATAN EYES
[1:46:18] <+BoomerTiro> ...isn't this literally the same rat behavior from Dishonored?
[1:46:19] <antthefool> This horde is terrifying
[1:46:19] <$Valdorick> We're getting closer to - A Way out, Siblings, a tale of many rats (tm)
[1:46:20] <%theAncopro> majin rats

[1:46:26] <kingra> Cursed rats
[1:46:27] <%skizzuto> red eyes that fear fire, it's just like Sekiro!
[1:46:28] <$Garthunox> It's the heartless
[1:46:28] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Matt would probably hate this game.
[1:46:29] <+justianxix> its in their nature
[1:46:30] <Dovakhin573> Fuckin Skaven
[1:46:30] <%Lillowh> That's bad manners

[1:46:38] <+sundayafternoon1> the entire game is an escort mission lol
[1:46:38] <ooblag> Rats haven't figured out table tech yet
[1:46:38] <gustavozxd> can rats super jump?
[1:46:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> CALL THE BYZANTINES and Their Greekfire
[1:46:39] <%PaladinDupre> RATS VS GOBOLINS
[1:46:39] <+BoomerTiro> Isn;t this literally the same rat behaviour from Dishonored which is also not how real rats behave
[1:46:40] <Triplicat> Jebaited
[1:46:41] <+jorgamund> yeah you'll be safe on the table when the're falling from the roof...
[1:46:41] <AlasterAngelo> Just pick the lamp up
[1:46:43] <sonofthedeepsouth> FALL
[1:46:43] <%maskedriderhero> just a sea of furry piranhas
[1:46:44] <%jiin6> Rats can't climb its fine
[1:46:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> meat
[1:46:45] <%Ranryu692> rats can jump so high
[1:46:48] <%ThePuddingDead> its like Night of the Lepus featuring Mark After Dark @AngriestPat
[1:46:48] <thegreenbenis> Rats are great at jump.
[1:46:50] <xeros720> i hope we find hero rats too
[1:46:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> I didn't think this would get me so bad. >>
[1:46:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> MEAT
[1:46:53] <$i_am_therydon> push the child. save yourself.
[1:46:53] <scritchez> what if you just threw the kid
[1:46:55] <$SGrim> You, 100%, could pick up that barrister burner and wield it like a spear.
[1:46:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Oh no there’s a Plague in the chat now!
[1:46:56] <+Reveresao> Throw the kid!!!
[1:46:57] <+TheSaintJohn> jump in the rat pit for fun
[1:46:59] <$Garthunox> plague rats vs mind gobolins
[1:47:00] <%ForgetfulUthanasiast> Theyre possessed by angry ghost rats
[1:47:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just jump in the rat pit, what could go wrong? :)
[1:47:01] <Louie_Salmon> @boomertiro seems more detailed, but yeah I guess it is
[1:47:02] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Use the flamethrower
[1:47:05] <%ThePuddingDead> the kid's got plenty of meat
[1:47:06] <%NWR_James> Steamed hams
[1:47:06] <$Valdorick> Throw the kid down! Give the rats their lord!
[1:47:07] <%spiritofmojave> Wack the child for more time on the clock
[1:47:08] <%TheDullaMAN> Try the windows.
[1:47:09] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> apatGib meat
[1:47:09] <+AllenDeadman> where does the game take place?
[1:47:10] <+cahv123> She can't pick up the lamp guys she has to hold her little brothers hands gawd.
[1:47:13] <%connos_livereview> delicious wall ham
[1:47:13] <Triplicat> he wants it so bad lol
[1:47:14] <$Rockgagong> the windows me boy
[1:47:14] <alrobot2014> france
[1:47:16] <%DeaconBluesClues> my sister would shit herself super hard at this game, she hates rats so much she insists we call them 'dolphins' if we see one
[1:47:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Windows?
[1:47:16] <JayEarly> I thought this was gonna be a Telltale game
[1:47:16] <+agentnuma> the strings when the rats converge is soooo good
[1:47:17] <%dylin456> remember no rats in alberta
[1:47:18] <+TheSaintJohn> throw the child to the rats
[1:47:18] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Jesus, its like the Heartless

[1:47:26] <%supersugoisenpai1> Use the child as bait
[1:47:26] <JayEarly> not The Rats Of Us
[1:47:26] <imshadow_35> @boomertiro this seems very similar to the behavior of Dishonored's rats
[1:47:28] <sonofthedeepsouth> Good thing hams are forever
[1:47:28] <+iforgottousername> sacrifice the kid to the rats
[1:47:30] <+darkParable> flamethrower technology should be top priority
[1:47:32] <deafmutelaughing> pay $.99 to get an extra ham

[2:00:33] <MrPwng3> @starotter70 plague type movie and like infection movies or more documentary?
[2:00:34] <sonofthedeepsouth> But really the first crusade did nothing wrong. The rest of them were atrash fire tho
[2:00:35] <Reanimator83> That’s for a different stream pat... wink, wink
[2:00:38] <$Rockgagong> yo remember that time pat had to hide on top of the toilet from a rat
[2:00:44] <%RioGascar> Was the plague in actuality good for us? It did sorta force hygiene or die
[2:00:51] <Pookiedaexzile> Did the Boys Rat Powers Activate
[2:00:56] <starotter70> @MrPwng3 Movies preferably, but docs work too
[2:00:57] <GoopyAvacado> SOAP
[2:01:02] <ItsKitKat_> Fun Fact 5 Literature and visual art changed course during the plague and the misery of the human kind was widely depicted in almost all verticals.
[2:01:07] <xeros720> totally hoping that inquisition guy is a giant rat
[2:01:11] <%llamington> petition to change this music to the walking around the streets music from vampire masquerade
[2:01:14] <%Hammerknife> @RioGascar it didn't force hygiene, people were still filthy for centuries afterward
[2:01:14] <ziggythehutt> Quick while he's gone everyone go to German Spy's stream
[2:01:19] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah
[2:01:26] <sonofthedeepsouth> dabs
[2:01:27] <%RioGascar> Well those people died then
[2:01:29] <Us3rr> @itskitkat_ I'm actually trying to look it up now, is there a word to describe the xenomorph shit/hay combo?
[2:01:30] <%king_wragles> Yo, let's go to Taka's instead
[2:01:33] <antthefool> Filthy commoners
[2:01:33] <%RioGascar> Problem solved
[2:01:38] <aimlesshealer> Man this game would've made such a great LP for the channel BibleThump
[2:01:40] <dakuman13> People still smell like shit today it didnt force anything
[2:01:51] <+Answer_Moose> @RioGascar Hygiene wasn't reason for the plague. It was fleas. ON RATS!
[2:01:53] <MrPwng3> @starotter70 closest thing I can super recommend is a zombie flick but like left for dead infected type called train to busan, not exactly plague but good movie
[2:01:54] <dakuman13> Just look at melee players
[2:01:55] <GoopyAvacado> shitstorm game
[2:02:00] <%Niney_Who> Melee Players would cause a Second Black Plague
[2:02:01] <alrobot2014> but what if people smelled like even worse shit
[2:02:02] <mar_krow> Also it population control the plague and at the same time increase in it with hygiene I believe
[2:02:04] <$Rockgagong> theres no crying in rat ball
[2:02:09] <%RioGascar> no it wasnt the reason no, but it did force standards to go up
[2:02:11] <%maybefalco> maybefalco subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! A Plague Tale is officially a medieval version of Alien
[2:02:14] <starotter70> @MrPwng3 Thanks

[2:06:12] <InkyDraconian> Fun Fact: when you sleep your always dreaming, but for the most part the part of your brain that remembers shit is turned off
[2:06:18] <%connos_livereview> i had a dream once where i was being pulled through a tunnel of camel spiders
[2:06:19] <Inebriateddonut> I got bit by a monkey in a dream once and I felt it in real life

[2:30:47] <DRAGKUDO> the ol classic "what was that noise"
[2:30:49] <dakuman13> @Inebriateddonut Yeah but chasing a spry young girl while you're in clunky ass armor, and actively faster than then is kinda nuts

[2:31:37] <Lunatyr_> armor isn't even super clunky irl, good armor at least

[3:09:22] <%king_wragles> For those who don't know, a simple sling can get a pebble going about 40-50 MPH, 60 if you give it some oomph
[3:09:28] <%walternatorz> good idea to loot the corpses during the plague
[3:09:30] <BappoSama> I was honestly waiting for the bigger kid to say, "remember to protect your head little ones."
[3:09:31] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I like how an Englishman during the 100 Years War sounds like a modern English speaker instead of Middle English
[3:09:38] <%jiin6> @AngriestPat now you need more fabric
[3:09:38] <%king_wragles> or was that 30-40(/50)?
[3:09:39] <@lewdskeletor13> @luesagna00 It’s magic rats, it’s not trying to be realistic
[3:09:39] <Lord_of_all_Edges> Save your upgrades for the shotgun, Pat
[3:09:41] <Rincewind1998> @Luesagna00 This is xstraight up fantasy, the kid has some kind of curse, and the rats are making Alien-style nests

[3:11:54] <BappoSama> So, this may sound ignorant of me, but since when were rats afraid of fire? I assume it's mostly because of instinct, but there's literally thousands of them....Couldn't they just smother it with there tiny bodies?
[3:11:54] <ManOfReason> this game is giving me anxiety

[3:13:41] <Lunatyr_> @BappoSama These rats don't have a hivemind controlling them or telling them what to do so I don't think any living animal would willingly hurt itself
[3:13:45] <+TheSystem_> @canonhusbando that’s not fun at all!
[3:13:56] <BappoSama> Hmm..
[3:14:12] <Idon__> just carry one of these around always

[3:14:21] <NeroInfinite> No better line of work than looting
[3:14:23] <%TeraMercier> Strange point, but I'm shocked that this is running at a decent framerate. Looks like the kinda game that sits around the mid 20s
[3:14:23] <%ItsRatman> I'd rather do whatever they're doing than work in retail still, No joke
[3:14:27] <BappoSama> Maybe I'm just too soft..I'd totally sacrifice myself if it means to help the rest of my group. :/
[3:14:27] <%Svanyr> Its a lucrative business. Minus the satan rats
[3:14:27] <%HyperCharge_Sam> take the torch with you!

[3:25:00] <Idon__> IT'S DOUBLE REWIND TIME.
[3:25:02] <MatheusSipolatti> YOU BLIND MAN
[3:25:02] <krymzen5> he died less painfully
[3:25:02] <kc703> how long?
[3:25:03] <12gagerager> It sure looked cooler.
[3:25:03] <alexandrecau> even the song plays fuck you evil
[3:25:10] <%Starlight_Gamer> better solution
[3:25:10] <%PanicSwytch> Die by Fire or Rats? I choose Fire
[3:25:10] <%The_Esquana> He’s good, just crispier than normal
[3:25:14] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> items
[3:25:16] <antthefool> Probably better to get crushed than to get ripped to shreds by rats
[3:25:17] <%Zundelle> death by fire sounds like a better end
[3:25:19] <McFlubberpantsLIVE> jars
[3:25:20] <MatheusSipolatti> you have sleep gas
[3:25:24] <MatheusSipolatti> SLEEP GAS, PAT
[3:25:25] <+zetaplus> nice dry heat
[3:25:30] <Fujiwara_92> ya could have just let him live tho
[3:25:30] <$Big_King_Coconut> sleep gas still kills them
[3:25:32] <%masneo2> bring out your dead! BONG!
[3:25:33] <gekizenbu> sleep drugs are expensive
[3:25:35] <InugamiTheHound> do rats like BBQ human??
[3:25:36] <$Valdorick> Sleep powder second chance, pat
[3:25:39] <Louie_Salmon> The "sleep" gas is also murder
[3:25:39] <bursky00> Pat just really wanted to kill that guy
[3:25:39] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat u have sleep gas and can wait in the grass
[3:25:40] <kc703> yo how long has he been playing?
[3:25:46] <%deviljhojho94> tomatoRat just a little closer...
[3:25:48] <%joyoustechnoshrine> the constant squealing is getting annoying
[3:25:49] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Sleep gas is close range, it wouldn't work chat
[3:25:53] <person181> why bot have the kids carry around like a arm full of sticks to take with them

[3:25:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 25m.
[3:25:58] <@lewdskeletor13> It doesn’t matter if you kill people, there’s only one ending
[3:25:59] <MatheusSipolatti> @Valentinius_Anodyne hE WAS PATROLLING
[3:25:59] <%spiritofmojave> Death by fire seems much quicker than bone's being gnawed on by a hundred rats
[3:26:01] <%Laecerelius> we can't contain Pat's murder boner!
[3:26:04] <%TeraMercier> Why wouldn't the underbrush be just teeming with the fucking ratws
[3:26:05] <alexandrecau> sleep powder is a consumable, also the rats likely get him

[4:01:23] <$RaikenTB> Whoever modeled that horse ass deserves a raise.
[4:01:25] <tank7013> The game literally said that making too many sleep items could lock him out of upgrades. There can't be THAT many resources around

[4:01:36] <Dr_Mooose> so regular vision
[4:01:37] <Inebriateddonut> How can Pat play this game when every tool is a consumable?
[4:01:37] <$ookiiapple> its almost like theyre people
[4:01:41] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Just like real life ya goober
[4:01:43] <%DedlokPM> @Zereaux unfortunately his character is too modest to rip off her clothes to use as fabric for upgrades. rooBooli
[4:01:43] <CriticKitten> It's almost like they have actual normal human vision
[4:01:43] <%Shady_Zaku> They're not blind, unlike you
[4:01:44] <$Hiro01231> It's daytime, of course they can seee a ways away
