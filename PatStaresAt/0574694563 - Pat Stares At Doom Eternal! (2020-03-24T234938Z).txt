[0:04:25] <%jessedouglas> EB Games closed before I could cancel my pre order of re3 and ff7 (because fuck that company) but fuck it, so I pre ordered ff7 digitally! I don’t even care if I get my $20 deposit on the games back! Either way almost at a year subbed! Enjoy playing rip and tear simulator!

[0:04:35] <%AmericanaRed> @draxtd I think only for PS4

[0:04:56] <+DesertPenguin> I just finished the Sentinel Prime mission
[0:04:59] <+DesertPenguin> I don't wanna watch anything past that
[0:05:08] <%AncelDeLambert> wtf, Twitch, why did I have to dig for this?
[0:05:11] <Saltmeisterr> @mechslayer71 wtf that's stoopid
[0:05:11] <Nina96> is the no 5hr podcast just a troll or is there a reason?
[0:05:15] <%valriot> COOM
[0:05:20] <+DesertPenguin> No reason that they've explained
[0:05:28] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @Nina96 to not give chat the staisfaction
[0:05:42] <xxmagonx> DOOT
[0:05:42] <Nina96> @Sphincter_Spelunker :(
[0:05:48] <Milo_san> psaDab
[0:06:00] <+mechslayer71> @saltmeisterr Yeah, he’s just annoying. Not even interesting to fight, just annoying and difficult (until you find out how to fuck him)
[0:06:03] <+DesertPenguin> I love the rambling but just put a 2 hour timer on that. then an 2 hours for news and emails
[0:06:06] <fairore> when can we see your island pat SwiftRage
[0:06:22] <CappuccinoGuil> Hell yeah, it's still there! Did Pat fully explore the maps because mind goblins?
[0:06:26] <khotgor> Animal Crossing needs an Isabelle Doom skin
[0:06:40] <%valriot> No, Doomguy needs an Isabelle skin
[0:06:41] <+DesertPenguin> Is the most recent Doom VOD the 6 hour one?
[0:06:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @khotgor I mean, couldn't you make it yourself with the custom designs?
[0:06:52] <khotgor> @DesertPenguin Yes
[0:06:53] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> part 3 is the 6 hours one yeah.
[0:07:07] <Saltmeisterr> I saw Sunhi fuck up maroauder

[0:07:11] <khotgor> @CappuccinoGuil *shrug*
[0:07:21] <Nina96> has Pat turned is island in AC to plastic/ cube land yet?
[0:07:22] <fairore> @valriot or a reference
[0:07:25] <+DesertPenguin> I have an hour left on the last VOD
[0:07:43] <fairore> @nina96 that's what I like to know
[0:07:48] <%spiritofmojave> Doom needs a country guitar and Animal Crossing needs Mick Gordon next releases
[0:07:51] <osiris1260> Apparently there’s an exploit to infinite the maurader by switching between ballista and super shotgun
[0:08:05] <thatWaulfyguy> i'm out of chips and im depressed
[0:08:09] <AvoidingTheCoronaVirus> I wish Mick would work on SMT or DMC that would be sick
[0:08:11] <khotgor> Doomguy has a bunch of guitars. He should be able to use them in battle nero/dante style
[0:08:12] <+DesertPenguin> what do you mean "to infinite the marauder"?

[0:13:57] <Square_Potato> what if one level is short though?
[0:14:00] <peachy996> Perfect amount
[0:14:01] <+chaumiester> Pat are you able to get groceries in these weird times? Are you able to get everything or is certain things always out of stock?
[0:14:01] <RubberFistFight> Your VRAM speed is gonna influence stuff like pop-in and intra-zone stutter more than anything else, you're likely already at the fastest for that. SSD is more likely to affect initial load in, but again you were probably already close to max speed with a SATA 6gb/s drive.

[0:28:04] <VritraReiRei> Unmaker?
[0:28:05] <+gimmickypizza> Doom guy develops doom confirm
[0:28:06] <%bevyrage> and we're in doom
[0:28:07] <%hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt Did you see the nunchucks next to the rock?
[0:28:08] <+Javaa01> Close to what Chocolate Doom is
[0:28:09] <+dante_must_die_exe> Soul Cube
[0:28:09] <%thesyndrome> soul cube, not cosmic cube
[0:28:10] <Fenlig> Wasn't it the soul cube?
[0:28:11] <+konekoryugamine> ARE THOSE COLLECTIBLES
[0:28:12] <%dekkitout> Soul Cube*
[0:28:12] <1matheuw> soul cube?
[0:28:13] <+PunishedBuck> C U B E
[0:28:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> Look at the backside of the chainsaw model
[0:28:15] <+Javaa01> Except Doom 3
[0:28:15] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> What armor are you wearing? Still the original?
[0:28:15] <peachy996> There's an Argent Containter too
[0:28:17] <trianglehat> all wads too
[0:28:18] <%wsintai> ESPECIALLY H-Doom
[0:28:18] <$floralkami> NOT DOOM 3
[0:28:19] <Nina96> 3?
[0:28:19] <Mister_McDerp> even the movie?
[0:28:20] <+NitronStreams> Cannons?
[0:28:20] <OvaltineDream> even movie doom?
[0:28:21] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> oh no, spoilers. later
[0:28:21] <%crimsonharvest> in Doom everything is real
[0:28:22] <ringabal> Even BIG GUTS is canon
[0:28:23] <Yummy_Nukes> bunny cage next to computer!
[0:28:23] <R3c0n31> Even 3?
[0:28:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> Every DOOM THAT MATTERS
[0:28:24] <+Javaa01> Doom 3 got abolished from canon
[0:28:25] <%Niney_Who> Not the movies
[0:28:25] <VritraReiRei> @hmgirlpopuri he did the first time he found the game
[0:28:25] <gekizenbu> Doom 3 is RIGHT THERE with the cube
[0:28:26] <wrightlight94> Even Doom 3 ?
[0:28:26] <ape_hawk> ESPECIALLY THE MOVIE
[0:28:26] <JokerNewby> @PatStaresAt did you get the Unmayker?
[0:28:26] <b_ikki> huge guts
[0:28:27] <1matheuw> doom 3 can still fuck off tho
[0:28:28] <Fenlig> Doom 3 was good!
[0:28:29] <%dekkitout> Every canon is Doom
[0:28:30] <xxmagonx> NOT the Movies!
[0:28:33] <%neVan0> LUL
[0:28:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> wgerestgesjatebiard
[0:28:34] <%Aracon_> doom 3 alt timeline LUL
[0:28:34] <%linkster291> Doom 3 is a retelling of half of Doom 1
[0:28:36] <+konekoryugamine> NOT THE MOVIES.
[0:28:37] <narusao> but but the rock tho
[0:28:37] <+TheShisno> Everything except 3 cause fuck 3
[0:28:37] <+konekoryugamine> NO
[0:28:40] <peachy996> Nahhh
[0:28:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOT THE MOVIES
[0:28:41] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat I'm still happy my Isekai protagonist guess was right
[0:28:42] <%Valdorick> THE MOVIES MOST OF ALL
[0:28:42] <%mastermindgoblin> Doom 3 is a weird doom game, but it's still pretty good
[0:28:43] <Sundaysmiles01> Wasn't Doom 3 a Prequel to Doom 1?
[0:28:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Does that mean Earth has been invaded already once before?
[0:28:45] <+Javaa01> The movie is more canon then Doom 3
[0:28:48] <%Louie_Salmon> One floor down
[0:28:49] <%crimsonharvest> i have 3/6 keys
[0:28:51] <%tusk102> the movies counted bc doom guys not in them
[0:28:51] <+TheShisno> Different universe where he becomes a corporal
[0:28:53] <%thesyndrome> unmakyr is kinda....ok, it's not the super-weapon I thought it would be
[0:28:53] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Even the COMIC is canon
[0:28:58] <%BeatBo_2> only the first one, but as an in-universe comedy
[0:28:59] <%Pyroclase> using the stairs smh
[0:29:00] <peachy996> The movie is based off Doom 3
[0:29:02] <blackbaron98> were the movie cannon🤔?
[0:29:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> Not jumping down
[0:29:08] <Fenlig> Did you get the secret above the power source?
[0:29:09] <hntronium> nice
[0:29:09] <+konekoryugamine> So, to go back a bit, WERE THOSE COLLECTIBLES BACK THERE?!
[0:29:10] <%jarednotwithsubway> last one in this level
[0:29:11] <+DesertPenguin> NOT WORTH IT
[0:29:12] <+mans51> laser sword?
[0:29:15] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> pat you can get that secret now
[0:29:16] <$floralkami> the ones that have been canonized are DOOM 1, 2, 64, Brutal DOOM and the comics
[0:29:18] <+Javaa01> Yes
[0:29:20] <1matheuw> why didnt khan makyr just took ir with her?
[0:29:21] <CappuccinoGuil> Huh, why does the hud look different?
[0:29:23] <%hmgirlpopuri> Doom 64 was a good doom
[0:29:24] <%bevyrage> dwayne 'the rock' johnson is doom canon
[0:29:24] <+Javaa01> It really is
[0:29:25] <%thesyndrome> doom 64 DESERVES to be Doom 3
[0:29:26] <DracaenaLeaf> Doom 3 is doom 4 lol
[0:29:27] <Yummy_Nukes> big brain take: doom 2016 and doom eternal take place in the doom 3 universe
[0:29:28] <peachy996> That's why The Rock is playing Sarge and why Pinky from Doom 3 shows up
[0:29:30] <+TheShisno> Doom 64 is HARD CANON
[0:29:31] <%SkyPirateArcane> The 5th slayer gate is by far the hardest, the 6th is actually pretty easy. Surprised me a lot
[0:29:34] <%solid_stro> Doom New Horizon
[0:29:35] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Doom 64 was the 3 all along
[0:29:36] <Azathotic> @floralkami DOnt say Brutal Doom. Please no...
[0:29:36] <CappuccinoGuil> Can you change the HUD?
[0:29:37] <%Pyroclase> I don't understand how Doom 2 is supposed to be canon. Was Earth destoryed twice??
[0:29:40] <+konekoryugamine> THE DEEPEST LORE WHORE
[0:29:40] <TioXyco> thought Final Doom was Doom 3
[0:29:42] <SleepyMaribo> unmakyr fucks demons up super hard too
[0:29:42] <indig0bird> What skin are you using right now?
[0:29:43] <+mans51> Kreygasm
[0:29:44] <%Louie_Salmon> Sick beat
[0:29:45] <+HappiestFace> swap i
[0:29:45] <SlappyMeats> sick beat
[0:29:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Sexy noise
[0:29:49] <tiaramaki> Reeeemiiiiix
[0:29:50] <Tucker0603> @patstaresat I'm still happy I was right about him being an Isekai protagonist
[0:29:50] <%SABiscotti> Dakka
[0:29:50] <%Zekuu69> 64 is in Eternal?! !
[0:29:52] <Fenlig> I think the minigun model is too smooth and future tech!
[0:29:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @pyroclase Alternate Earth
[0:29:53] <R3c0n31> @PatStaresAt Be sure no cheats are on. for some reason for me they were counted as being on therefore the Slayer Key didnt spawn
[0:29:53] <%solid_stro> psaBougie
[0:29:55] <+TheShisno> The gunshots are the beat
[0:29:55] <+mechslayer71> It’s honestly not that good, it sharing ammo with bfg just makes it a liability to use
[0:29:55] <+withguac> What about the Dwayne Johnson movie
[0:29:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> You're rip & tearing me apart, Lisa!!!
[0:29:57] <%crimsonharvest> I learned to love the Ballista, i'm so proud of myself for beating the ravager in the slayer gate
[0:29:58] <XelGel> training hear
[0:30:00] <boogaleeboo> Doom 2 was a small scale incursion and they covered it up, evidently
[0:30:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> Knight skin
[0:30:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @pyroclase Right? i dont get it either
[0:30:01] <%tusk102> Gladiator?
[0:30:02] <XelGel> gear*
[0:30:02] <$floralkami> @azathotic just the glory kills, lol
[0:30:03] <+Javaa01> He's using the Sentinel Training Armor
[0:30:03] <indig0bird> Preatorian?
[0:30:03] <+konekoryugamine> RIP AND TEAR
[0:30:04] <%Valdorick> Sentinal?
[0:30:05] <%TheActuallyGuy> Training gear
[0:30:06] <%Pyroclase> @GeneralSCPatton is that suggested anywhere?
[0:30:06] <+konekoryugamine> RIP AND TEAR!
[0:30:07] <peachy996> Praetor?
[0:30:10] <Sundaysmiles01> I think its the classic skin
[0:30:12] <Azathotic> @floralkami Oh thank god
[0:30:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[0:30:16] <SleepyMaribo> BFG devision!!!
[0:30:21] <XelGel> warm up room
[0:30:22] <%optimasmaximas> @tucker0603 yo chill you lowkey spamming that
[0:30:22] <+konekoryugamine> The FUCK was that from the top left?! WAS THAT TOASTY?!
[0:30:36] <$floralkami> JUST RIGHT INTO IT
[0:30:38] <+konekoryugamine> This is so stupidly awesome
[0:30:39] <+TheShisno> SourPls
[0:30:41] <$floralkami> NO LUBE
[0:30:41] <$KnivesEve> how much rip and tear did i miss?
[0:30:48] <allmightythunder> What if DOOM goes on to have enough sequels to go up to DOOOM 63, what will we do...
[0:30:48] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pretty heavily suggested that it's a multiverse, which then also explains how most Doom WADs are canon now.
[0:30:48] <hntronium> not much
[0:30:48] <+konekoryugamine> Not much
[0:30:49] <TioXyco> Praetorium gear? how many cutscenes you had to endure and how much time you spent to get it ? (get it?)
[0:30:53] <%optimasmaximas> Just started knives
[0:30:56] <%TIME_PUNCHER> What do you call a Terminator wearing make up? Pretty metal
[0:31:01] <+TheShisno> Doomguy abuses prisoners, but they're deemons so it's okay
[0:31:02] <Dova573> I am a bit sad that Gauss boi is not back
[0:31:04] <$KnivesEve> nice
[0:31:05] <+konekoryugamine> DId you just fucking slow time?!
[0:31:06] <LeeOhX> I love that every weapon is viable
[0:31:07] <indig0bird> Honestly, the Preatorian is my favourite. Never a fan of the uncovered gauntlet. Maybe less of a pet peeve now I know the Doom Slayer is magically empowered
[0:31:10] <$floralkami> GOD, I love how the Ballista sounds when charging and firing
[0:31:10] <VritraReiRei> @KnivesEve about 3 minutes? He played a minute of Doom 2
[0:31:10] <+konekoryugamine> IS DOOM GUY A WITCH NOW
[0:31:20] <b_ikki> dont die in training mode
[0:31:21] <+SoundVoid> I’ve been meaning to get this game and now I guess I have the time to play it as well
[0:31:22] <%GeneralSCPatton> Doomguy rampaged through a lot of Hell portals to get where he is now.
[0:31:24] <%thishere2103> thishere2103 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 39 months!
[0:31:24] <%Louie_Salmon> Upgraded blade is much better
[0:31:42] <+DesertPenguin> How come he's doing the Ripatorium again? it's just a training simulator. YOu don't get anything from beating it again right?
[0:31:43] <peachy996> Prefer the Prator Suit myself, appreciate the Astro and Crimson skins to suit the plot
[0:31:44] <+konekoryugamine> This game is so stupidly awesome
[0:31:47] <Azathotic> What mission is Pat on?
[0:31:50] <slimey0> This game needs a style meter
[0:31:50] <+Javaa01> Agitated Skeleton
[0:31:52] <%Intersceptre> Intersceptre subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months! Hey Gingers. Construction work in Uk deemed 'essential' despite workers not wanting to go, means Hotel jobs like mine are essential too. I'm stuck in the Dark Zone. Peach knows about my girls health woes, hope I don't get her sick. FeelsSadMan.
[0:31:56] <+TheShisno> You go to Hell like 3 times in 2016
[0:32:05] <%thesyndrome> you should stick with the OG doomguy look, it's great for cutscenes
[0:32:06] <%Pyroclase> Pat, you have more viewer than Bernie right now.
[0:32:06] <$floralkami> @desertpenguin it's a good warm-up
[0:32:10] <+konekoryugamine> @Intersceptre Hope things get better for you, my dude
[0:32:13] <+TheShisno> Pat killed the Gladiator last strem
[0:32:13] <ataxia72> what's up fuckers I just caught a stringfish
[0:32:14] <%Aracon_> good start
[0:32:18] <b_ikki> @Intersceptre wash your hands
[0:32:19] <VritraReiRei> Did you customize your HUD at all? Colors, text, display options, etc... @PatStaresAt
[0:32:20] <+DesertPenguin> I guess, I'd rather just play. If you die so what? it's a game lol
[0:32:26] <CappuccinoGuil> Hey Pat, what HUD option are you using?
[0:32:30] <+DesertPenguin> Astro is cool
[0:32:36] <%Intersceptre> At least I get 100% wage, and I'm hosing myself with alcohol gel
[0:32:37] <Nina96> thats just a practice room right/
[0:32:38] <+konekoryugamine> Oh kaDAMN
[0:32:39] <Tucker0603> but gladiator skin
[0:32:40] <XelGel> yep
[0:32:40] <ringabal> YEAH EX GUN SKINS
[0:32:40] <+DesertPenguin> I'm using Astro now, the white is a clean look

[0:32:44] <Nina96> ?*
[0:32:48] <indig0bird> FUCK, my feed froze!
[0:32:49] <peachy996> Ugly Makyr skins
[0:32:49] <%Pyroclase> it varies by gun, the color of skin
[0:32:51] <indig0bird> I couldn't see it
[0:32:53] <osiris1260> NOOOO, THE ABS
[0:32:57] <+konekoryugamine> THEY'RE FLOPPIES!!!
[0:32:57] <%optimasmaximas> I like the new modern design
[0:32:58] <1matheuw> i think theres a makyr skin for the doomdude
[0:32:58] <indig0bird> This is so annoying
[0:33:00] <LeeOhX> Waiit how did you get the Demon Doomguy?
[0:33:01] <+konekoryugamine> EEEEEE!!
[0:33:02] <%Intersceptre> Rather be home mind you.
[0:33:03] <CappuccinoGuil> Oh shit, I got distracted, what did he say he's using for the HUD?
[0:33:12] <+konekoryugamine> My purest little heart is excited so much right now
[0:33:21] <+TheShisno> Deemon Doomguy is deluxe edition thingy
[0:33:25] <%thesyndrome> this level is a fuck, it ate up so many of my lives
[0:33:26] <%Pyroclase> the chaingun and plasma gun get astro skins, the shotgun and heavy cannon get green skins
[0:33:26] <peachy996> yes let's go

[0:33:44] <%linkster291> You'll see why soon.
[0:33:45] <%Louie_Salmon> Mm maybe
[0:33:46] <SleepyMaribo> this is where the final purple gate is, you get the unmakyr after this
[0:33:47] <%Tearonex> Last level is probably the hardest
[0:33:47] <+konekoryugamine> OH this is some DARK catacomb shit!!
[0:33:49] <peachy996> it's tough
[0:33:50] <%SkyPirateArcane> Eh this one wasn't super bad
[0:33:50] <ataxia72> this is definitely not the hardest level
[0:33:51] <Tucker0603> idk how to feel about this skin, I like yet also don't
[0:33:51] <Dova573> Also Im glad the shitty lazer pistol dint comeback, but would have like a Revolver or a cool heavy pistol

[0:33:54] <LeeOhX> THE LORE HERE IS DOPE
[0:33:58] <%thesyndrome> I found it harder than any of the levels that came after it
[0:33:59] <+DesertPenguin> Okay gotta go, later guys. I'll catch up tomorrow after I play this for myself
[0:34:00] <%Louie_Salmon> Next couple of levels are rough too
[0:34:04] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> This level is only the hardest if you are bad at video games
[0:34:08] <+konekoryugamine> OH MY GOD . . .

[0:38:14] <StefyRaRa> PAT. SHOOT. DOG.
[0:38:17] <Mige_> seems like pat knows the combo
[0:38:19] <Twichty> schut dog
[0:38:23] <%taku_toots> He wuick
[0:38:31] <%crimsonharvest> pup snuffed
[0:38:31] <$KnivesEve> try to glory kill this one if you want
[0:38:31] <+HypotheticalWalrus> I felt like the marauders got harder as the game went on
[0:38:33] <%GraceTBM> the combo seems like a bitch to do on controller
[0:38:35] <%joey_jo_jo_juniorshabadoo> The soundtrack is like baby's first metal, but the metal is basically angsty dubstep using two frets on the guitar.
[0:38:36] <+dirtyh4rr1> kill the ghost furries
[0:38:37] <%SkyPirateArcane> So the dog is based on distance I'm pretty sure
[0:38:38] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt protip: rockets remote detonation can hit around his shield, just shoot it to his left or right (or just above), and detonate when it's past his shield, it trivialises the fight
[0:38:39] <CappuccinoGuil> Just BFG the dude Kappa
[0:38:41] <+GeneralHysterics> FIRST* TRY
[0:38:44] <%BeatBo_2> Doomguy kills another Vergil
[0:38:45] <Funky_Honkey> pro tip, Arbalest makes short work of Marauders
[0:38:47] <+Irridium> glory kill from the right is fucking sick on him
[0:38:47] <Mister_McDerp> that one gif made it look easy
[0:38:48] <+titansloth93> they resist BFG
[0:38:48] <%crimsonharvest> @CappuccinoGuil you can't
[0:38:50] <discozombi> The music in this game reminds me of the band Meshuggah
[0:38:51] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> see? Easy
[0:38:52] <+Irridium> and left
[0:38:55] <+LandOfTheWay> WELCOME TO TOWN, FUCKER
[0:39:00] <+mechslayer71> @hypotheticalwalrus I felt the exact opposite. Once I figured the combo out to fuck them it was trivial
[0:39:06] <peachy996> @Breakfast_Megapowers This isn't even the annoying one
[0:39:07] <CappuccinoGuil> @crimsonharvest I know. That's why I Kappaed
[0:39:09] <%tusk102> YEAAAAAHHHH

[0:43:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Archviles are hype men
[0:43:53] <%Kenori> Kenori subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Have this 1 year anniversary during these trying times. Also, I put Doomguys real suit on. The 2016 suit is best. #coveryourarms.
[0:43:53] <R3c0n31> Does pat not remember them from Doom 2?

[0:44:28] <%Louie_Salmon> I kinda hate the slow-down rune
[0:44:29] <+GeneralHysterics> trying to stick a lost soul kappa
[0:44:29] <CappuccinoGuil> Lost Souls AI is really busted in this game LUL
[0:44:30] <%realm_forge> The fully upgraded heat blast plasma rifle is AMAZING
[0:44:33] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Sam: you suck doomguy

[0:44:37] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt To save time, end of the room, statue on the right kneeling
[0:44:38] <+Javaa01> Now get ya secrets
[0:44:38] <ape_hawk> not our fault that the angels were corrupted so easily, samuel!!
[0:44:41] <+TheShisno> Archvile is the totem and it WILL NOT tell you until AFTER you kill it. One thing I actually dislike, the most annoying enemy is the one time they won't tell you how to kill it before you start fighting
[0:44:44] <trianglehat> rad
[0:44:44] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt just use it, theres really no reason to hoard them
[0:44:45] <%hmgirlpopuri> First time I saw the notes about mastery tokens I was worried they were gonna be paid DLC
[0:44:46] <ringabal> That's rad
[0:44:49] <%Louie_Salmon> That's rad
[0:44:50] <Monkeyweed21> It would be cooler if you werent using the baby slo mo rine
[0:44:51] <+NitronStreams> That's Rad
[0:44:51] <+mans51> rad af
[0:44:52] <DXLelouch24> Archviles are just hypemen for the demons
[0:44:52] <%Piemen99> RAD
[0:44:52] <CappuccinoGuil> So there are no tutorials on?
[0:44:54] <$Slimshazbot> @floralkami Ah, bummer :c
[0:44:56] <Fenlig> @tusk102 I was referring to the original archville
[0:44:58] <%Deadpal> I have NEVER FIGURED OUT THAT ROOM.
[0:44:59] <karl_rex> Rad Suit? This isn't fallout
[0:44:59] <%D00msDayDan> @ape_hawk actually it's kind of completely sam's fault
[0:45:00] <$RetroCop87> I'm starting to kinda agree with Sam
[0:45:03] <KingVantq> oh this secret LUL
[0:45:06] <%tusk102> @Fenlig ah i see
[0:45:06] <%Deadpal> HOW DO YOU GET IN THIS ROOM
[0:45:09] <+TheShisno> Because he must be correct, he's a pissbaby who cannot be wrong
[0:45:10] <peachy996> This secret is a toughie
[0:45:11] <+GeneralHysterics> I wonder is sam put a penor on his robo body. Like, what if he gets bored?
[0:45:12] <+Javaa01> The way to get in there is to smash a statue on the other side of the arena
[0:45:12] <+PunishedBuck> There's a statue with cracks on it near the objective
[0:45:12] <%Deadpal> I have NEVER GOTTEN IN THERE.
[0:45:13] <SleepyMaribo> secretswitch needed
[0:45:13] <+kraajkase> have fun figuring this one out
[0:45:13] <ataxia72> this room took forever to figure out
[0:45:15] <%solid_stro> Hey Pat do you think Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing will subconsciously be remembered with the Corona Virus. Like years from now we’ll remember Doom Eternal and say “oh yeah that C-virus shit that happened”.
[0:45:15] <LixFury> TOP SECRETS
[0:45:16] <XelGel> @TheShisno thats the point he intentionally sits back so you can discover him
[0:45:16] <CappuccinoGuil> This one is tricky, took me a bit to find
[0:45:17] <%linkster291> You got to find a swtich.
[0:45:18] <%realm_forge> LOOK FOR KNEELING WALL STATUE
[0:45:19] <bcdenton> there's a button hidden somewhere in the room
[0:45:19] <MasterTonberry23> Sam may have Optimus' voice but he'll never have his FIIIIRE
[0:45:20] <rosemon5001> this will take some time he wont figure it out
[0:45:20] <wrightlight94> There is a statue to break to enter that room
[0:45:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> choot chain?
[0:45:20] <+aspirationdeath> got really high the other night and played this to the new code orange. orgasmic experience
[0:45:22] <peachy996> Solution is not as close as you think it is
[0:45:23] <ringabal> Big puzzle for Big Orb
[0:45:23] <+Verd_254> shoot the chain?
[0:45:23] <%Louie_Salmon> This took me like 15 minutt
[0:45:24] <%Deadpal> where the hell is that switch!?

[0:45:25] <Fenlig> That secret took me an hour!
[0:45:25] <%D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt there's a statue to punch near the front of the room
[0:45:25] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Do you shoot the chain?
[0:45:25] <a_timberdoodle> I had two points where Lost Souls just screamed round in circles against the geometry after I killed everything else in the arenas.
[0:45:26] <+Irridium> I'll be real this one took me a fucking minute to find
[0:45:26] <%walternatorz> there was a green spot on the chain
[0:45:26] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt protip: there things you can punch in the environment that arent walls
[0:45:26] <KingVantq> @Deadpal some super hidden bulldshit

[1:00:00] <$Covidbuttlicker> All other channels are borked at well

[1:01:53] <%SkyPirateArcane> Vampyre is pretty fun. The endgame is rough difficulty wise but I enjoyed it
[1:01:59] <peachy996> @GeneralHysterics I like that it's a callback to Sarge from Doom 3 but much better designed

[1:03:32] <MasterTonberry23> Hey Twitch put the difficulty in the stream description so we can laugh at the people that ask about the difficulty
[1:03:37] <$Covidbuttlicker> This game seems cartoony compared to 2016. You cool with that?
[1:03:41] <%D3rrtyD4n> D3rrtyD4n subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
[1:03:41] <trianglehat> peach
[1:03:42] <%optimasmaximas> dont open it

[1:03:50] <IminyourBase> paige could you check if covid is at the door
[1:03:54] <%WhereIsWill> don't it's doomguy!
[1:03:59] <Yummy_Nukes> peach no it's a trap!
[1:04:00] <XelGel> thats what the 1st one was like
[1:04:02] <Nina96> 2016 wasnt cartoony?
[1:04:04] <%tusk102> this is the most videogame videogame and its perfect
[1:04:06] <%valriot> 2016 was just red and grey
[1:04:11] <%Hiro01231> I return
[1:04:13] <%MayorRev> watch out Paige it's the Corona man!
[1:04:14] <%Aracon_> AYYYEEE desktop twitch is back
[1:04:16] <+GeneralHysterics> 2016 is super bland
[1:04:19] <b_ikki> 2016 was not this cartoony
[1:04:20] <+kraajkase> Thats what makes it good!!
[1:04:20] <%jarednotwithsubway> LAST GATE
[1:04:29] <%Totally_not_toby> keyyyyyyyyyy
[1:04:33] <+mechslayer71> But yeah I didn’t realize the similarities between the guy who gave Doom guy his powers and Samuel. Not the same person tho I don’t think, otherwise he would’ve been able to predict the event of 2016 and prevent them (or fight better against them)
[1:04:36] <XelGel> did you punch the pruple gate?
[1:04:44] <osiris1260> Notice Samur was a weird tentacle monster under the robe?
[1:04:48] <TheAmazingClaytor> Oh hey, was just watching the playthrough on Youtube and saw you were live :)
[1:04:55] <Monkeyweed21> Pat cant swim up
[1:04:55] <DarknessD42> That's rad!
[1:05:00] <%mighty_max_t> This puzzle gave me such trouble
[1:05:00] <ahaegotrigger> SAVED
[1:05:02] <%SaiyanShoto> 2016’s color palette was very bland compared to eternal
[1:05:05] <+GeneralHysterics> pat gonna hold his breath lmao
[1:05:10] <ape_hawk> in the end, arent we ALL weird tentacle monsters under robes?
[1:05:12] <tiaramaki> @osiris1260 Samur is Saddler? monkaS
[1:05:19] <+republo> ded
[1:05:25] <ringabal> shoot
[1:05:26] <Mister_McDerp> cthulu is our ally against satan
[1:05:28] <XelGel> wrong way
[1:05:28] <peachy996> its fine
[1:05:31] <SSBBfan666> @PatStaresAt you try shooting the red light on the gate to get the last key
[1:05:33] <%EtheralFlameX> uh oh fucky wucky
[1:05:33] <+Flunkorg> @osiris1260 All the maykrs are wierd tentacle monsters...
[1:05:34] <mobiusnightshade> @ape_hawk It's not always a robe.
[1:05:37] <%jarednotwithsubway> its fiiiiiiiiine
[1:05:37] <peachy996> you're fine OHSHIT
[1:05:37] <LeeOhX> To think the thing that doom guy is weakest to is acid water
[1:05:38] <$RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt Can you back out after you beat the final gate to get your sword?
[1:05:38] <@commanderclaw> Fucky doo dah is my favorite camp song
[1:05:45] <%Rumbutt> Aren't water sequences just your favorite? oroLUL
[1:05:45] <peachy996> see? you're fine
[1:05:47] <MasterTonberry23> This reminds me of the underwater sections in DMC1. Those were awful too.
[1:05:47] <Edible_Enthusiasm> Puzzzzzzles
[1:05:55] <hntronium> This swimming sucks
[1:05:55] <+kraajkase> use the jump button to swim up
[1:05:58] <tiaramaki> Toughy woughy
[1:05:58] <Onatamana> Pat doesn't think in 3 dimensions very well
[1:06:04] <%Mr_Improbable> Beat this game the other day. My only negative for this is that swimming was unnecessary.
[1:06:06] <%Piemen99> JUMP IN
[1:06:06] <mobiusnightshade> Reminds me of trying to get Kidman out of the piss water in Evil Within 1.
[1:06:10] <+maenos2> Swear those horns are starting to play Thus Spoke Zarathustra
[1:06:18] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt jump button is to swim up
[1:06:18] <%D00msDayDan> not being able to dash up or down sucks ass
[1:06:21] <%GraceTBM> Pat thinks in three dimensions: left, right, and chat
[1:06:23] <Monkeyweed21> Pat is vertically challenged
[1:06:26] <DexteraXIII> Anyone else remember the swimming sections in DMC 1?
[1:06:38] <hntronium> I member
[1:06:39] <MasterTonberry23> @DexteraXIII Yeah, they were awful
[1:06:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> The concept of up offends his sensibilties as a shorty
[1:06:41] <peachy996> This ambient track is great
[1:06:44] <%tusk102> i member
[1:06:54] <+mechslayer71> Shit like this and the purple goo really make me wonder what the fuck the team was smoking at some points. Like, to do all the dope shit this game does but simultaneously do shit that literally makes no sense and is fun for no one, what happened?
[1:06:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> KILL DAEMONS
[1:07:03] <xDartuzax> @RetroCop87 With fast travel, yes
[1:07:09] <gameever> What is the (square root of 850)/15? The answer doesnt want decimals
[1:07:12] <zipfile777> yea
[1:07:15] <Onatamana> Is there a water demon in this game
[1:07:27] <+PunishedBuck> yes

[1:12:53] <MasterTonberry23> Wanna see me tempt fate? WOW THIS GATE IS EASY!
[1:12:55] <%crazyspartan214> use chainsaw for ammo
[1:13:10] <%tinyswampthing> do the micro missile feel weaker in this game compared to 2016 or is it just me
[1:13:14] <%BeatBo_2> is this basically FPS Devil May Cry?
[1:13:24] <%thesyndrome> @tinyswampthing definitely weaker
[1:13:24] <+PenmanLupine> yes
[1:13:25] <peachy996> He might actually get that Secret Encounter provided he doesn't lose any lives and does the SSG+Arbalest Combo
[1:13:25] <+mechslayer71> @beatbo_2 Yeah
[1:13:29] <@commanderclaw> Demons will cry
[1:13:30] <%Niney_Who> Whiplashes are the only female demon in this game

[1:13:41] <peachy996> Whiplashes are bitches
[1:13:42] <dking0000> @tinyswampthing they can be the highest group dps with the kill buff
[1:13:47] <%dekkitout> Are Smmoners not in this one?
[1:13:48] <+GeneralHysterics> super okay
[1:13:52] <+Javaa01> It wasn't okay
[1:13:52] <CptHarlok> I hate those fuggin snakes more than any other enemy type honestly.
[1:13:53] <%BeatBo_2> 1 life
[1:13:55] <ImmaCanuck> 1 life left NotLikeThis
[1:13:57] <MasterTonberry23> The micromissiles were always kinda underpowered
[1:14:03] <Saltmeisterr> archviles are just summoner
[1:14:04] <%BeatBo_2> time to clutch it out, Pat!
[1:14:04] <KingVantq> @dekkitout you mean Archvilles?
[1:14:05] <Dova573> This medusa fucks are pieces of shit
[1:14:16] <Dova573> I hate backdashing into them
[1:14:17] <%dekkitout> From 2016
[1:14:18] <+GeneralHysterics> the snakes are slippery as hell, I use the super shotgun meathook to hold them in place
[1:14:23] <%Niney_Who> HUGE GUTS
[1:14:23] <peachy996> Summoners are not in, Whiplash has the Wave and Archvile summons
[1:14:26] <XelGel> hey smol cyber demon
[1:14:29] <CrazyMedicine> Cyberdemon?!
[1:14:30] <+TaurusOxford> Cyberdemon's here. :)
[1:14:32] <peachy996> Tyrant so huge
[1:14:35] <tsb_gorilla> KomodoHype It’s like playing a game focused on TF2’s scout but in hell
[1:14:36] <TheAmazingClaytor> Shoot it 'til it dies
[1:14:39] <%BeatBo_2> HE HAS HUGE GUTS
[1:14:40] <$anita_dickin> shoot it until it dies
[1:14:45] <+GeneralHysterics> I love how the tyrant warning sounds fit in with the music.
[1:14:46] <+CrunchyFrog_> i think ive died to the whiplashes and prowlers more than any other enemy in game
[1:14:47] <%BeatBo_2> RIP AND TEAR
[1:14:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt shoot it until it dies
[1:14:53] <XelGel> they can't name him cyberdemon cause cyberdemon was a title to one of them
[1:15:00] <%crazyspartan214> If you see a group of weak demons clump together; use flamethrower first, then grenade for faster armor shards
[1:15:04] <MasterTonberry23> That Archvile is gonna keep summoning mooks
[1:15:05] <+theman515> @CrazyMedicine They're just dudes in this game. Just to put it in scope how nuts this game gets
[1:15:16] <JunkyardCrow> Cyberdemon? He's slim pickings.
[1:15:17] <Onatamana> I think there's an archvile
[1:15:18] <CrazyMedicine> oh i see
[1:15:35] <peachy996> I love Cyberdemons are minibosses under a new name.
[1:15:36] <+GeneralHysterics> ladies and gentlemen we got him
[1:15:39] <%tusk102> oof
[1:15:43] <+theman515> Nah, no archville
[1:15:45] <dking0000> Lorewise Tyrants are a subrace to the 2016 Cyberdemon iirc
[1:15:48] <MasterTonberry23> One cyberdemon wasnt enough so they had to start mass producing them
[1:15:52] <%snow_bush> snow_bush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! Oh hey, 16 Months. Doom is pretty fun to watch when trying to keep the pope from suicide crusading into Jerusalem in Crusader Kings
[1:16:05] <%BeatBo_2> like mass produced evas
[1:16:09] <XelGel> When i chainsaw i just think of a punch of candy popping from them

I'm normally to get annoyed with stupid bullshit in media, but your RE6 streams were one of the rare cases where I couldn't stop laughing at all the nonsense on screen. Now I know why people latched onto RE7.
[1:36:43] <DaCheekyOne> @indig0bird I don't know much about it. Just felt like it was something interesting
[1:36:45] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Not sure how, but when Sunhi does that he goes Super Shotty, Ballista, Combat Shotty. I think the CS has more range for the blow back

[1:41:26] <ape_hawk> sam, no one asked you
[1:41:28] <bendatron> isnt the combo the other way around arent you supposed to start with the ballista?
[1:41:31] <Dizzle_Sizzle> SAM-YUH-EL
[1:41:32] <%FlyguyJP> Doom Sneks are basically dead
[1:41:32] <TheAmazingClaytor> Meathook snek and dissolve snek
[1:41:32] <%Th3SmartAlec> We live in a Makyr society, Sam says
[1:41:33] <usurper_sos> hmmmm
[1:41:39] <+kraajkase> he seems to know an awful lot huh
[1:41:40] <+GeneralHysterics> SAM-UR-EL??
[1:41:43] <Storm_Samurai> Samurrrruel?
[1:41:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Look, he's been reading a lot of books, okay?
[1:41:47] <1matheuw> i mean he created fake but still usable hell energy
[1:41:49] <%Louie_Salmon> @bendatron I don't think it matters
[1:41:55] <ape_hawk> he was suspicious since the first game, pat
[1:41:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> HE IS REALLY GOOD AT XENO-ARCHEOLOGY
[1:41:58] <+Kduff89> S. Hayden..... hmmm Sayden...... SATAN
[1:41:59] <junks2300> I missed the beginning of the stream; any big plot revelations today?
[1:41:59] <%GraceTBM> it's not a specific combo bendatron, just a useful sequence of weapon switches
[1:42:00] <%Hiro01231> he merged pretty easily with your ship too
[1:42:00] <Manwad> samuel hayden is an anagram for john romaer, don'tcha know
[1:42:02] <+JustToWatch> he was the head of the uac
[1:42:04] <Yummy_Nukes> the seraphim told him about it probably
[1:42:05] <Storm_Samurai> Neversoft logo
[1:42:06] <%solid_stro> Pat if I told you that Argent energy has perfect rollback netcode would you consider it?
[1:42:06] <CappuccinoGuil> Whaaaaaaaat? sammy being SUSPICIOUS? That's crazy
[1:42:07] <peachy996> Oh god the Urdak scenes are fitting so well right now, I need to finish the game
[1:42:11] <%FlyguyJP> Doom (2016) had Samual just being a super smart human who wanted to have a bad ass robo-body.
[1:42:12] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt The ARC scientists called his armour "alien", even though he was part of the UAC
[1:42:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Storm_Samurai This is starting to feel like a name pun you'd see in an anime or somethong
[1:42:21] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Anything posthumously researched in a heavy metal capacity = XENO*blank*
[1:42:23] <%Louie_Salmon> Blood punch is an instant kill on pinkies btw
[1:42:27] <+OneGorillionDollars> The way sam says "your people" even he was human before becoming a robot riiiight? TheIlluminati
[1:42:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @solid_stro Argent energy is NO LAG AT ALL
[1:42:32] <KingVantq> ^^^
[1:42:32] <%SkyPirateArcane> And when you picked Sam up, the scientists said that his circuitry was "alien" and they couldn't figure it out
[1:42:33] <%GraceTBM> just jump over them and use the SSG
[1:42:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @solid_stro Does it have soulback netcode?
[1:42:39] <ape_hawk> hey guys, what would sam's name be if kojima wrote this game
[1:42:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> @OneGorillionDollars What does he mean, "your people"?!
[1:42:45] <+GeneralHysterics> Did you ever see sam as a human?
[1:42:46] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Solid Sam
[1:42:50] <%ArchimerDreatect> screw perfect rollback, ask for perfect internet
[1:42:53] <%Th3SmartAlec> @GeneralHysterics Nope
[1:42:53] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Liquid Sam?
[1:43:00] <KingVantq> @GeneralHysterics no
[1:43:00] <TheAmazingClaytor> @ape_hawk Sayden-Man
[1:43:01] <junks2300> Robot Man
[1:43:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Dizzle_Sizzle Serious Sam
[1:43:03] <%GraceTBM> "Architect of Our Suffering" AOS for short
[1:43:03] <+greenfall> blood punch goes thru pinky armor as a reminder
[1:43:05] <peachy996> Kojima would call him Moses
[1:43:12] <+GeneralHysterics> Then how do we know he's a human?
[1:43:12] <peachy996> Tell me he wouldn't
[1:43:12] <rickaay15> @GeneralHysterics He's got a portrait in the 2016
[1:43:17] <Ultimatefool> Pinkies leveled up
[1:43:23] <%GraceTBM> it's so sick that blood punch is an instakill on pinkies
[1:43:26] <+UnwoundCaesar70> @generalhysterics Theres a picture in 2016 but you never actually see him
[1:43:30] <peachy996> He was sick
[1:43:31] <%DappercatEsquire> If it was Kojimbo, it would be Sam BEFOREMAN
[1:43:31] <+vaporousTippler> Shaving accident.
[1:43:32] <%Niney_Who> wouldn't you
[1:43:32] <trianglehat> it's fine
[1:43:33] <Onatamana> He had terminal cancer
[1:43:33] <+UnwoundCaesar70> as a human
[1:43:34] <peachy996> OR WAS HE?!
[1:43:34] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Hey well 9 1/2-foot tall super robots...
[1:43:35] <ape_hawk> thats what happens to ALL scientists
[1:43:35] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> hmm
[1:43:36] <ringabal> The cancer helped
[1:43:36] <%za7az> He had cancer
[1:43:37] <%Piemen99> HMMMMM
[1:43:38] <NaturalGear> he was dying
[1:43:38] <+kraajkase> "cancer"
[1:43:39] <+GenesisKnight> You'd become a 9 foot robot voiced by Darin DePaul if you could
[1:43:40] <Centrilion> He had cancer
[1:43:40] <BeefyQueefer> Just a mid-life crisis.
[1:43:40] <a_timberdoodle> terminal brain cancer
[1:43:40] <Monkeyweed21> Pat would totally do that too
[1:43:41] <+JustToWatch> I mean I totally would if given the chocie
[1:43:43] <nazzynoeyes> Brain cancer
[1:43:43] <+Verd_254> sometimes you gotta becomes a robot idk
[1:43:44] <+Soulsbjorne> he didnt just feel like it
[1:43:44] <%Niney_Who> He did have cancer
[1:43:44] <buffmurffy> i mean, who wouldnt do that?
[1:43:45] <%wolfofsound> wouldn't you want to be a giant robot?
[1:43:47] <%FlyguyJP> Almost like maybe robo-sam assumed Hayden's identiy
[1:43:48] <usurper_sos> WHY NOT
[1:43:49] <galabuddy> because it's sick
[1:43:49] <%BeatBo_2> what if it's all a work
[1:43:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> ..hmmmmmmm
[1:43:51] <+gutlesscoward> maybe he wanted to not have to do the gross human things humans do
[1:43:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt don't act like you wouldn't want to be a tall robot
[1:43:53] <+GeneralHysterics> I like the mid life crisis answer more than anything
[1:43:54] <+Shubreaker> tell me you wouldn't
[1:43:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> did you
[1:43:55] <peachy996> Big Cole Phelps level Doubts right now
[1:43:55] <+Theworld732> wouldnt you pat
[1:44:02] <%ahl9307> ahl9307 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
[1:44:03] <+TheBigO75> Because why the heck not?
[1:44:10] <nademonkey1100> idk man dying of cancer or become 9ft super robot
[1:44:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> And ARC scientists said his circuitry was "alien" when you picked him up
[1:44:13] <a_timberdoodle> I mean he designed a way hotter body, living the dream.
[1:44:14] <Onatamana> Maybe he wanted to be immortal but also not be a toilet
[1:44:17] <%Manjove> robot bodies are cool though
[1:44:17] <+RogueCrocodile> My theory is that that guy was Hayden, this guy isn’t
[1:44:18] <%wolfofsound> if I could become Big O I'd sacrifice everyone in this chat
[1:44:19] <%solid_stro> Human transmutation fucks you up, Pat
[1:44:20] <+Soulsbjorne> Omfg Pat lol obv didnt read log from 2016
[1:44:21] <iosephe> I liked that bit of lore!
[1:44:24] <%FlyguyJP> TBH If I could afford an 8 ft tall super-strong robot body, i'd take it
[1:44:24] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Oh boy that metal riff.

[1:45:09] <%tusk102> @GraceTBM ballista arbalest does increased damage to flying enemies
[1:45:12] <%GraceTBM> It feels like ballista takes three charged arbalest shots or four standard for Elementals
[1:45:14] <%Manjove> rip secret

[1:45:15] <Sundaysmiles01> Lore Whore Wants MOAR
[1:45:18] <Dizzle_Sizzle> YESSIR.
[1:45:18] <%Aracon_> holy shiiiiiit
[1:45:18] <CappuccinoGuil> In one of the codexes in 2016, it says he wanted a body that invoked strength of leadership to guide humanity. The first time Argent was sent to Earth, the switch was too large for anyone but Hayden to flip it. He was literally the only man capable of bringing power to Earth.
[1:45:18] <%GeneralSCPatton> @roguecrocodile Some kind of fusion of Samur with a living human host in a cyborg body?
[1:45:20] <%BeatBo_2> YO
[1:45:23] <peachy996> What a sick lookin Civil War
[1:45:23] <ringabal> aaaaaaanimeeeee

[1:45:47] <midnightbomber57> PAT CAN READ!
[1:45:52] <ScreamLord> Gross, he's using a pistol DansGame
[1:46:02] <%TaphexWin> Ohhhhhh, so the Sentinels at the arena weren't true sentinels then?
[1:46:04] <+RogueCrocodile> @generalscpatton or samur just assumed Hayden’s identity after death
[1:46:11] <peachy996> Oh yeah remember the Pistol?
[1:46:11] <%Louie_Salmon> @tusk102 The armor looks kinda skinny, could just be perspective I guess
[1:46:13] <%tusk102> MIRACLE FUEL
[1:46:17] <%GeneralSCPatton> @yummy_nukes He had a more controlled plan, if only the cult didn't fuck it up
[1:46:20] <ringabal> HUMAN INSTRUMENTALITY
[1:46:22] <Dova573> Man I want some power metal ballad about the night sentinals
[1:46:24] <peachy996> Pistol goes bye bye LUL
[1:46:27] <%tusk102> @Louie_Salmon it's just cuz their far away tbh
[1:46:29] <Dova573> get sabaton on this shit
[1:46:31] <CappuccinoGuil> @TaphexWin no, they are true sentinels. Sentinels are just the soldiers who protect the Argenta and fight for the Khan
[1:46:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @midnightbomber57 Woolie is so jealous
[1:46:38] <MasterTonberry23> Oh my god HEAVEN AND HELL ARE THE SAME
[1:46:39] <%DappercatEsquire> @Yummy_Nukes Long con to kill Khon Maykr?
[1:46:45] <bimjojo> asses of the argents?
[1:46:47] <%FlyguyJP> Indoctronated Asses?
[1:46:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> "BUT JETPACKS THO"
[1:46:48] <CookieDoughFK> Woolie would love this lore
[1:46:51] <%solid_stro> Diablo
[1:46:52] <Dizzle_Sizzle> @MasterTonberry23 YESSUH.
[1:46:55] <%Manjove> CONSPIRACY THEORISTS
[1:46:59] <%grandark_z317> so they were complacent.
[1:46:59] <Mister_McDerp> what if Satan was God
[1:47:02] <%FlyguyJP> Can't get enough HELL JUICE
[1:47:04] <MasterTonberry23> Didnt Bayonetta do this already?
[1:47:16] <Dizzle_Sizzle> I mean...
[1:47:16] <+Pookiedaexzile> WAS SAM A SNITCH>
[1:47:19] <%Piemen99> GODS ARE ASSHOLES
[1:47:21] <Ultimatefool> Pat, can you read the first paragraph again, I forgot
[1:47:22] <ringabal> Guys, Valhallah is pretty metal
[1:47:25] <peachy996> Woolie should do the level first then use Fast Travel to backtrack unless he sees secrets on the way
[1:47:25] <CappuccinoGuil> @CookieDoughFK Woolie is gonna lose it when he plays this. It's literally the Catholic Church indoctrination and the fucking crusades LUL
[1:47:38] <peachy996> Would work for his lp I think
[1:47:42] <MasterTonberry23> When is Darlington gonna play this, whats he waiting for?
[1:47:43] <TheAmazingClaytor> This is gonna be on the test guys, can I copy someones notes?
[1:47:44] <+Shubreaker> THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL KILLERS
[1:47:45] <+GenesisKnight> THE MIGHTIEST OF ALL KILLERS
[1:47:47] <%FlyguyJP> So basically Heaven was like "Hey this Hell Juice is pretty good shit"
[1:47:51] <%TaphexWin> @CappuccinoGuil Oh, okay, that explains why even though he killed a hell priest, he still lost sovereignty with the sentinels
[1:47:54] <junks2300> This lore is some REAL bull shit.
[1:48:02] <Dizzle_Sizzle> -1 you spelled MAKYS INCORRECTLY FUCK.
[1:48:02] <%Th3SmartAlec> lul
[1:48:03] <bimjojo> and then you rip and tear
[1:48:04] <peachy996> @MasterTonberry23 Probably waiting until it stops being new lol
[1:48:07] <hntronium> the spice must flow
[1:48:08] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Makyrs*, yikes.
[1:48:09] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pew pew
[1:48:12] <%Ner234> SHOOT GUN
[1:48:17] <bimjojo> ripeth and teareth thine guts
[1:48:17] <+Javaa01> Too bad the demons fucked up the Wraiths and drew energy from them instead
[1:48:25] <boxofhooligans> And so the demons that tasted the bite of his sword, named him... the Patinator
[1:48:26] <bimjojo> -doom jesus
[1:48:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> Yeah, just go back to the weird Chaotic Neutral Pagan gods instead of this angel and demon shit
[1:48:28] <MasterTonberry23> @peachy996 He played Indivisible when it came out, and that game wasnt even that good! (yeah I said it)
[1:48:39] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Dan Brown wrote this.
[1:48:42] <+CSNG> And the Slayer shoteth his gun, and then he shoteth it again, and it was good. amen
[1:48:43] <peachy996> Fast Travel
[1:48:43] <Mister_McDerp> Old Gods > Satan
[1:48:44] <%TreeeFOX> the lore and story is the single worst part of this game
[1:48:47] <ringabal> PERFECT
[1:48:50] <peachy996> That works too
[1:48:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> All according to plan
[1:48:52] <+sixcubit> BRUTE SMARTS
[1:48:53] <%FlyguyJP> We gotta bring Cthulu back
[1:48:53] <rosemon5001> subarashi
[1:48:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @TaphexWin Here's the catch: it's not Sentinel blood only, apparently it's any Argenta. The Order of Daeg aren't Sentinels, they are like another path they followed in that society
[1:48:55] <%solid_stro> If demons had any self preservation they’d runaway but they’re completely mindless.
[1:48:57] <%grandark_z317> @mastertonberry23 considering Ajna's a dumbass, I don't expect it to be good.
[1:49:09] <+RogueCrocodile> @generalscpatton imagine Doom Thor
[1:49:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @TaphexWin For all intents and purposes, tho, same difference LUL
[1:49:20] <peachy996> STOP
[1:49:26] <SatansDelight> fast travel?
[1:49:28] <peachy996> Yea
[1:49:32] <midnightbomber57> I'm the DoomThlayer
[1:49:37] <%FlyguyJP> Smart demons know enough to throw mindless minions at Doomguy to slow him down so they can try to escape
[1:49:38] <peachy996> Good 1up

[1:49:52] <Dizzle_Sizzle> LOL.
[1:49:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> @roguecrocodile The wraiths are elemental. Lightning wraith with a hammer?
[1:50:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @solid_stro because they number in the near infinite. You kill hundreds, thousands more pour in.
[1:50:02] <ringabal> LIGHT PUZZLES
[1:50:04] <Dizzle_Sizzle> Porzzle rum.

[1:50:15] <Dizzle_Sizzle> PORZZLE.

[1:50:39] <+Yakobro> SHADOW PUZZLES
[1:50:40] <Onatamana> gotta go fast
[1:50:45] <%wolfofsound> it's more likely than you'd think
[1:50:46] <Dizzle_Sizzle> What is this Hellboy 2 shit?
[1:50:48] <CappuccinoGuil> @FlyguyJP more likely than you think
[1:50:52] <StarlitStunner> SPEED

[2:09:55] <%Th3SmartAlec> @PatStaresAt Pretty sure one dash at a time is more efficient when traveling

[2:09:59] <Monkeyweed21> this is embarassing
[2:09:59] <usurper_sos> doing a big think
[2:10:00] <SleepyMaribo> your jump is disabled after falling a certain amount
[2:10:00] <KingVantq> once you star falling for awhile you cant jump again
[2:10:00] <+LandOfTheWay> DIG UP STUPID
[2:10:01] <%PlainSimpleTailor> The lid
[2:10:01] <%Aleate> If you go too fast, you can't use your second jump. Its fucking dumb

[2:10:03] <duraju> truly the hardest demon
[2:10:03] <+SoriduSnaku> you fall too fast to use the boost

[2:22:08] <corpsegoo> the real struggle for me is an introvert is trying to control my sleep schedule when under 0% obligation to do it

[2:22:09] <+Remery_> Don't know how, I have so many single player games to put work in, Nier Automata, Nioh, FF15

[2:22:37] <%FlyguyJP> Oh by do you have your stockpile of TP ready?
[2:22:40] <%PlainSimpleTailor> and we're the QuaranTEAM
[2:22:42] <%tizz86> anyway, without the railroads operating as the second line of transport (behind shipping) nothing gets delivered
[2:22:46] <omen_setter> this is my moment to shine
[2:22:47] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt You and Woolie were getting close to workers' rights issues on the podcast, have you guys ever though of using your platforms to push for unions in QA and other areas of the industry?
[2:22:50] <heartlesshealer> I'd like to take walks without getting hassled
[2:22:51] <mankeytennis> QuaranBaron at best

[2:23:09] <+Irridium> Y'all see that tweet how the Quarians in Mass Effect are named that way because they basically live in quarantine
[2:23:10] <%alcors_wisdom> i always forget what my un is
[2:23:11] <Sundaysmiles01> Quarian makes a lot more sense as a racial name now
[2:23:13] <+Verd_254> hope everyone is ready for the next generation, the "quarantine kids".
[2:23:14] <%solid_stro> We’re basically the Qurrians from Mass Effect now
[2:23:15] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt So are the zoomers going to be re-named the Quaranteens?
[2:23:17] <%D00msDayDan> "real" suit

[2:23:27] <%WhereIsWill> is there a marauder skin??
[2:23:29] <peachy996> It just looks nice
[2:23:30] <Mister_McDerp> we were the real Quarians all along
[2:23:31] <%Pyroclase> EH, thje 2016 suit actually looks meh here. The colors are messed up and it looks weird.
[2:23:32] <trianglehat> oh boy
[2:23:41] <RantingRavager> UNIONIZE
[2:23:41] <ImmaCanuck> Well don't stop there!
[2:23:42] <heartlesshealer> it's strange that they don't
[2:23:43] <+TheBigO75> Fucking lit

[2:23:48] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 23m.
[2:23:52] <boogaleeboo> The marauder is just the sentinel suit on a demon man
[2:23:52] <Redmannasah> Man, but I really like the new suit, but I really like the 2016 as well.
[2:23:55] <+NitronStreams> Thinking Doomguy needs to cover his arms is objectively wrong
[2:23:58] <%tusk102> Boy do i love that americas not doing that essential jobs thing. My 16 year old younger brother and my poor mom are still forced to go to work because no paid leave despite them working in restaurants
[2:23:59] <%FlyguyJP> Unionization would require there not being a sea of cheap gig workers there
[2:23:59] <boogaleeboo> sentinel is a real real good skin
[2:24:11] <indig0bird> And take a wild guess who was deemed essencial
[2:24:11] <%britishfrog> britishfrog subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
[2:24:12] <+TheBigO75> Unionize
[2:24:13] <+mans51> but won't somebody think of the corporations?

[2:24:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> OOOOH CANANDA
[2:24:21] <xxshadowxx416> castle coward beast
[2:24:23] <corpsegoo> my understanding is that tech is banking on you feeling lucky to be there
[2:24:27] <%tusk102> but the union at least existed tho @PatStaresAt
[2:24:41] <+terranfirma> Is twitch stuttering every nine seconds for everyone else?
[2:24:45] <%neVan0> LUL
[2:24:47] <+AtlasMcCoy> Who needs a union when you can air your grievances to the billion dollar company who will replace you at the drop of a hat?
[2:24:50] <%Dizzle_Sizzle> Well, damn.
[2:24:54] <%SoFarFetched> Should try and refresh @terranfirma
[2:24:56] <+greenfall> unions always become currupt, learn to stand up for yourself
[2:24:57] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt Boy do i love that americas not doing that essential jobs thing. My 16 year old younger brother and my poor mom are still forced to go to work because no paid leave despite them working in restaurants
[2:25:01] <+terranfirma> I've refreshed like six times lol
[2:25:03] <+terranfirma> It's only twitch
[2:25:05] <%TheActuallyGuy> @terranfirma not for me
[2:25:09] <%weissguard> Must be nice to have union support. LUL

[2:25:14] <+TheBigO75> I'll gladly pay dues for that kind of protection.
[2:25:14] <+hoenhime344> sounds like a coruptable system
[2:25:16] <+Irridium> @greenfall knew a guy who tried that and got fired the next day LUL
[2:25:16] <heartlesshealer> people can't stand up for themselves due to power difference though
[2:25:22] <thatWaulfyguy> People against unions either want to work you to death or are letting perfect be the enemy of good
[2:25:28] <heartlesshealer> it would take actual violence and that tends to be a big no

[2:26:08] <Redmannasah> Pats into being the baby bird
[2:26:08] <corpsegoo> outsourcing creative talent for most companies means needing to pay another group to fix the first groups work and paying more than you would going to competant people in the first place
[2:26:09] <$Dakuu75> omg, that made me choke on my water
[2:26:11] <$Covidbuttlicker> I'm unemployed due to Covid BUT my wife got a promotion because of covid. AKA I stay home and play videogames and she works overtime. I'm living my best life

[2:26:59] <indig0bird> Right?!?!?!?! They literally cannot get rid of the workforce that way
[2:27:04] <CookieDoughFK> Just automate everything
[2:27:16] <+greenfall> @irridium working retail is not a marketable skill sorry to say
[2:27:18] <%SoFarFetched> @terranfirma can always try restarting your computer and see. I'm making guesses though but it's like what else is there to do and try LUL
[2:27:18] <%solid_stro> Lessons with Pat time
[2:27:20] <+Pookiedaexzile> Outsourcing isn't as esy as people think
[2:27:25] <%MonsterEnvy> MonsterEnvy subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! So it seems the Maykr's were basically huge grifters instead of angels. But it's interesting seeing Angel beings work with Hell like them. Would you agree Pat.
[2:27:33] <heartlesshealer> "marketable"
[2:27:33] <RetributionP> Pat the Orberlord
[2:27:38] <%tizz86> aka, life of a subcontractor

[2:27:46] <%PlainSimpleTailor> No you didn't
[2:27:50] <heartlesshealer> I'd say patience dealing with idiots is a skill
[2:27:58] <%griffball13> its true
[2:28:05] <ShineTheDiamond> Yup
[2:28:10] <mankeytennis> He got a flow chart
[2:28:15] <%Intersceptre> @heartlesshealer it's called 'hospitality'
[2:28:17] <%PlainSimpleTailor> I'm usually too mad from trying to understand what they're saying
[2:28:17] <ImmaCanuck> That guy probably works 80 hours a week below minimum wage.
[2:28:23] <+GenesisKnight> I hate calling customer service for that exact reason.
[2:28:34] <heartlesshealer> @Intersceptre Thanks, I knew it had another name
[2:28:35] <%Th3SmartAlec> @mankeytennis it's just the SF4 Ken flowchart

[2:29:23] <%Intersceptre> can we outsource Pat?
[2:29:32] <Meekest> Hey man. Wet naps
[2:29:33] <%WhereIsWill> 8.10!? luxury lol
[2:29:38] <%FlyguyJP> American Companies: "Yeah it's pissing off customers BUT PROFIT"
[2:29:41] <%Totally_not_toby> it's time to outsource pat for a skinny indian man
[2:29:47] <%SkyPirateArcane> Yeah. And it won't work
[2:29:49] <%Totally_not_toby> sorry paige this is just how it's gotta be
[2:29:51] <%Totally_not_toby> cutbacks
[2:29:54] <%DappercatEsquire> Then the backdown
[2:29:55] <%Intersceptre> Indian Pat would be incredible
[2:29:56] <%Marchtothesea> Companies don't care for you, that's why you need a Union. Take this opportunity to Unionize your workplace.
[2:29:57] <%linkster291> A buggy nightmare
[2:29:58] <%tusk102> yeah
[2:29:58] <+OutLawMiller> yes
[2:29:59] <%Aracon_> Yup
[2:29:59] <%Pappajimbo> I work for a UK ISP its the excat same shit
[2:30:00] <heartlesshealer> what better jobs can people get without that entry level experience that's getting flooded with people who already also work at the "better jobs" because people gotta work multiple unlike 30 years ago?
[2:30:01] <+AtlasMcCoy> Ya

[2:30:06] <+BubbaRands> oh god yes
[2:30:08] <1matheuw> the wat
[2:30:09] <%Jumpie8> yeah

[2:30:20] <@StridentSong> They do.
[2:30:21] <FrankysDream> @PatStaresAt can you be specific on those movies?
[2:30:21] <%bevyrage> DO NOT FORGET that writer's strike shit writing KEPT GOING ON FOR OVER EIGHT YEARS AFTER THE STRIKES WERE FINISHED due to production times
[2:30:23] <Meekest> So nothing changes for Konami
[2:30:24] <%BeatBo_2> the writer's strike is a good analogy
[2:30:27] <xxshadowxx416> yeah it right now
[2:30:28] <+Gutsandlove> yeah
[2:30:29] <+MugenSandan> Pat as a former cell phone salesman just want to let you know that customer service reps were being directed to lie. Not to lie in the way sales just IS, I mean as in tell actual falsehoods that could get you in trouble legally.
[2:30:29] <%42nfl19> @PatStaresAt You mean how they outsourced the boss fights in Deus Ex??
[2:30:31] <+Neoepochx> !uptime
[2:30:32] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 30m.
[2:30:32] <Yummy_Nukes> just put penalties on companies who outsource
[2:30:32] <%Intersceptre> outsource QA is a nightmare
[2:30:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> this music fits
[2:30:34] <+hrudzie_1> @PatStaresAt banks in canada are so cheap, as an employee you have to deal with outsourced INTERNAL calls
[2:30:46] <%BeatBo_2> they'll outsource the coding and actual legwork @PatStaresAt
[2:30:47] <%Jumpie8> or they don't have qa at all Kappa
[2:30:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Why is all the art in the new Cod just elephant men with six arms
[2:30:49] <+Irridium> the "but they'll outsource it!" thing is funny because they already do that shit as much as possible
[2:30:50] <%Agami23> my grandpa worked at GE for ages. they always seemed like a buncha assholes. but that was their airplane division
[2:30:51] <%BeatBo_2> realistically speaking
[2:30:58] <%FlyguyJP> Right that will work LUL
[2:31:12] <ringabal> The most you'll typically get nowadays is "Tounge in Cheek" humor against Big Corp in games like Outer Worlds.
[2:31:21] <%FlyguyJP> Just have high-end workers LEAVE THE COUNTRY to dodge unionization
[2:31:23] <%Intersceptre> we will just stick our top guys in hell
[2:31:26] <$SpecterHDMC> game industry companies are to independent for that
[2:31:28] <%marsantas> Ubisoft ran from union rights from France to Montreal
[2:31:36] <chambatron> Google did that for Google Apps for Work in the Philipines but it didn;t work LUL
[2:31:38] <%theotherkristian> theotherkristian subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! yeyeyeyeyeyeyey Doom!
[2:31:53] <+hrudzie_1> idk where you bank, but the big 5 canadian banks are the worst for this
[2:31:56] <%BeatBo_2> isn't that replacement thing happening right now?
[2:31:57] <@commanderclaw> How's that working for Naughty Dog?
[2:31:58] <+TheBigO75> Getting into game dev is a friggin nightmare
[2:31:59] <%AncelDeLambert> they'll TRY to raise the prices of games, and we'll laugh at them
[2:32:02] <%FlyguyJP> Entry level meatgrinder
[2:32:04] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you ever see that shit about how ceo's make like 927% more than the average worker or some shit
[2:32:05] <+NitronStreams> A new 25 year old is born every day
[2:32:06] <+hrudzie_1> I worked at scotia and they even outsource internal services
[2:32:06] <%Agami23> god damn scabs
[2:32:12] <%Marchtothesea> Seriously Unionize your workplace
[2:32:15] <omen_setter> rip naughty dog
[2:32:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> And when they raise the price this is important...STOP BUYING GAMES
[2:32:19] <@StridentSong> The way this works currently is they will have "team leads" in the company itself, and an outsource team that executes the test plan. The team leads will have their asses busted for the ad-hoc testing and creating the test plans, and the outsource team will do 100% of the guided testing
[2:32:20] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt I think you and Woolie could help give something like Game Workers Unite a lot of visibility
[2:32:21] <Meekest> Gamestop doesnt even wanna close their stores for a plague
[2:32:23] <+mans51> Just makes me think of the diablo immortal/wc3 reforged (alot of outsourcing on the latter)
[2:32:23] <indig0bird> THAT IS ALREADY KNOWN
[2:32:23] <mobiusnightshade> Burnout is real, and it's rough.
[2:32:27] <%Agami23> that didnt kill the manga industry
[2:32:27] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt did you see that shit about jobs taping over the section of coronavirus procedures with the last one being "go home"
[2:32:28] <%solid_stro> So is being a manga artist
[2:32:32] <%WhereIsWill> good Ted talk pat
[2:32:36] <+Irridium> but if you do that execs may not be able continue with their 15 million sign-on bonuses and we can't have that now can we
[2:32:39] <oAznoUta> I'm at the end, aren't I
[2:32:40] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt if I didn't do my research on the industry I would've chosen the game dev track of my IT degree instead of software dev.
[2:32:43] <%moogleboy1984> At least until the union becomes corrupt like here in the US
[2:32:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> Also I'm 25 and I will definitely do that because "OOH RENT MONEY"
[2:32:47] <+TheBigO75> Someone tag a big wig stat
[2:32:49] <%trustycoyote> Activision has a college for that. Train new people, chew through them because why not that have bodies to replace them.
[2:32:49] <junks2300> @AncelDeLambert I dunno man, Video games have gotten more significantly more expensive all at once, more than once in my lifetime. People will spend a lot for something they want.
[2:32:52] <cybz98> a unionization has been overdue for like a decade now it feels like
[2:32:52] <%alcors_wisdom> so long as we dont get culty
[2:32:53] <%Intersceptre> @tusk102 i wish my place would do that
[2:32:54] <+greenfall> most if not all blue collar jobs pay very good are considered a necessary and plenty of jobs open non union btw

[2:33:42] <%tusk102> @Intersceptre no no no thats what i meant. They fucking put tape OVER the part that said "go home" so their workers wouldn't read it
[2:33:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat has had the OPPOSITE experience with unions then I have
[2:33:45] <%Valdorick> "We raised your pay by 5 cents, but your union dues are increased by 7 cents"
[2:33:45] <hntronium> not for me they are

[2:33:49] <ImmaCanuck> LIBERALS STOLE MY PIE
[2:33:49] <%marsantas> They don't want to screw over the workers because the workers are their 'voters'
[2:33:50] <+CSNG> But what if you're not part of the union
[2:33:51] <%hrudzie_1> hrudzie_1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 7 months! I worked at scotiabank in ontario, they even outsource call centres for their own employees... imagine being the fucking BANK and being that cheap

[2:37:06] <Mrbaconator> i think the BFG is just way better
[2:37:09] <$RetroCop87> did the game volume drop?
[2:37:10] <+einherjarvalk> turn up the audio Pat
[2:37:12] <%Niney_Who> Not exactly
[2:37:12] <+kawachipto> yeah it's pretty useless lol

[2:37:15] <Sundaysmiles01> you got sentinel batteries?
[2:37:15] <%alcors_wisdom> game quite
[2:37:16] <+Delenay> i think the game sound wasnt turned back up after you turned it down to talk
[2:37:17] <$KnivesEve> seems quite
[2:37:17] <blue_falcon_fight_club> audio up plz
[2:37:19] <%solid_stro> Meh BFG is better
[2:37:24] <heartlesshealer> oh yeah, he turned it down during food time
[2:37:24] <%Niney_Who> It's better for Single Targets
[2:37:24] <+Irridium> BFG you can only fire twice, this you can fire 60 times.
[2:37:25] <%Pyroclase> Nah the Unmaker is great
[2:37:26] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> I like this one better
[2:37:27] <AlfredoCavatelli> unmaykr is more ammo efficient
[2:37:28] <+mans51> Looks sexy though
[2:37:28] <heartlesshealer> CHOCOLATE WRAPPER
[2:37:29] <$anita_dickin> depends on the situation
[2:37:29] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> BFG Is better
[2:37:30] <Mrbaconator> the BFG hits a whole room this just sprays in front of you @PatStaresAt
[2:37:31] <+Javaa01> The actual BFG is for clearing arenas
[2:37:31] <TheAmazingClaytor> BFD is Bae For Good
[2:37:31] <%Agami23> i just had to stop playing doom eternal because this section fucking goes and goes and goes
[2:37:31] <RyanTheRecluse> less ammo better damage per shot
[2:37:31] <peachy996> I don't know about better but I like the BFG more
[2:37:32] <+CrunchyFrog_> unmaykr is better on the final boss
[2:37:33] <%alcors_wisdom> could not hear sam's saxy ass voice
[2:37:34] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres fuckin places here in america that put tape over the "go home" part of the coronavirus response sheet they put up on the walls
[2:37:35] <R3c0n31> Unmayker is better for bosses then BFG
[2:37:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Bigger Fucking Gun
[2:37:36] <%fattness132> BFG better for large areas / groups. Unmakyr for 1-2 targets you need dead NOW
[2:37:38] <%Pyroclase> BFgG is for groups, unmaker is for lone heavy hitters
[2:37:38] <TYBGerritt> BFG is better but ghe Unmakyr is good for IoS
[2:37:40] <%Louie_Salmon> BFG for rooms, unmayker for doods
[2:37:40] <+greenfall> unmayker would be better with a larger ammo pool
[2:37:41] <%D00msDayDan> unmakyr is for when that cyberdemon's GOTTA go, bfg is for when the whole room's fucked
[2:37:42] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt This is a Plasma Rifle that uses BFG ammo
[2:37:43] <%linkster291> Because it's rapid fire, you get more shots, but since the Ammo for it is rare BFG is better overall.
[2:37:43] <%FlyguyJP> BFG needs zero aim but I do see the Unmayker as having more consistent output
[2:37:43] <+Neoepochx> That's cause we haven't gottent he Demon keys yet Kappa
[2:37:45] <heartlesshealer> hide chocolate wrapper from baby
[2:37:46] <seaechiowai> This is why you shouldn't work at grocery store for first/teen job. your perception of work gets skewed

[2:37:47] <ringabal> @PatStaresAt If this is the final stretch, are you going to get through to the ending?
[2:37:48] <CappuccinoGuil> Unmaykr does so much damage and is more controlled. You can't accidentaly ruin yourself by shooting a wall
[2:37:49] <OtterSlinger> Unmakyr is better if you're taking out a single enemy like those fucking marauders
[2:37:52] <%Marchtothesea> I gotta be to work early so I'm gonna go to bed, chat. Unionize your workplace. Practice Social Distancing. Be gay, do crimes.
[2:37:53] <CookieDoughFK> Too Loud
[2:37:53] <%linkster291> It's cool, but sucks to use.
[2:37:57] <%ryome> Unions are corrupt, but your boss would fire you for a 22-year old with your skills if they could
[2:37:58] <Yummy_Nukes> unmaykr has it's uses, I'd say they're both useful
[2:38:03] <%Th3SmartAlec> CLANg
[2:38:06] <$anita_dickin> BFG gets 2 shots, unmayker gets 60
[2:38:07] <%duraju> unmaykr is good for the finale

[2:38:08] <trianglehat> psaWink
[2:38:08] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> UNMAKYR is mai waifu <3 <3 <3 UuwuU
[2:38:10] <+SoriduSnaku> Unmaker is good for taking out single enemies, bfg for large groups. Use unmaykr on a tyrant for example
[2:38:14] <Equirah> @PatStaresAt BFG - crowds; Unmakyr - single target
[2:38:16] <CappuccinoGuil> Remember, folks, BFG stands for Be Fucking Gay
[2:38:16] <%FlyguyJP> @PatStaresAt Take the Unmayker to the Ripitorium to test it out
[2:38:17] <heartlesshealer> the traditional greeting punch
[2:38:19] <+kawachipto> unmakyr is only useful on final boss
[2:38:20] <R3c0n31> I mean you press button and anyhting in front of you will die
[2:38:22] <boogaleeboo> If you want a room to be gone you fire the BFG, if you want a big monster to get messed up you unmakyr
[2:38:25] <dking0000> BFG for all the little guys to fuck off. Unmaykr to have that one big boy to fuck off.
[2:38:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ryome and Unions won't care as long as the 22 pays dues
[2:38:27] <Mrbaconator> @duraju you are correct however overall BFG is justt better
[2:38:28] <peachy996> BFG can kill a lot more in those 2 shots and doesn't need to kill in a line.
[2:38:38] <+titansloth93> I would hope so

[2:38:56] <%Niney_Who> Pat's BRAIN DOESN'T TRUST REALITY
[2:38:57] <+Javaa01> Pat you already smell like poopoo
[2:38:57] <%fattness132> psaGoblin
[2:38:57] <CappuccinoGuil> @R3c0n31 but if you misfire and hit a pillar, wall or a zombie, you wasted a shot. Unmaykr uses less ammo and does great damage

[2:39:03] <RantingRavager> TURN THAT POOP INTO WINE
[2:39:04] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> no
[2:39:05] <aonagainhaha> Unions only become shit when they are more concerned with social issues than securing wages for their members
[2:39:07] <Meekest> No Paige
[2:39:07] <heartlesshealer> Orb Broken, please ask Paige
[2:39:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> youre an idiot

[2:39:13] <%MelBrooksKA> pat hears and then he smells
[2:39:14] <RyanTheRecluse> yeah but bfg does less damage against single targets for the ammo it consumes
[2:39:14] <%bread_assassin> @PatStaresAt What if they just lie?
[2:39:16] <+mans51> @PatStaresAt how many lootboxes have you bought?
[2:39:17] <%ShichiNoBushi> "Surprise Mechanics™"
[2:39:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt unmakyr is for single targets bc you get 60 shots. bfg is for crowds bc only 2 shots
[2:39:18] <%crazyspartan214> TURN THAT POOP INTO WINE!!!
[2:39:18] <%ryome> HE ALSO CANT SMELL OR TASTE
[2:39:18] <blue_falcon_fight_club> DO IT STINK???

[2:39:19] <karl_rex> Pat 2020 - IT COULD BE P O O P
[2:39:19] <%Louie_Salmon> No one wants to be surprised BY POOP
[2:39:19] <DarkestDawn64> Surprise Mechanics
[2:39:20] <%redrins> as someone who hates surprises, I can relate
[2:39:20] <%linkster291> The surprise would be poop
[2:39:21] <mobiusnightshade> IT COULD BE WORMS, PAIGE!
[2:39:22] <%Shadicara> Surprise poop
[2:39:22] <%TIME_PUNCHER> It's cocoa poop sauce
[2:39:22] <+CSNG> Paige hears then sees, Pat checks then he smells
[2:39:25] <%TreeeFOX> if my boss would dance in my blood for a nickle, what would a shit comp. like Bethesda do?
[2:39:25] <%Emperor_Machinus> surprises suck
[2:39:30] <osiris1260> Surprises are the worst
[2:39:31] <+einherjarvalk> there's a secret above the unmaykr
[2:39:33] <reddpop_> surprises could be anything, even a syringe full of air
[2:39:34] <+einherjarvalk> did you get it?
[2:39:35] <+maenos2> Pat how can you love Paige if you won't smell her poop?
[2:39:35] <%FlyguyJP> Go to the Ripitorium to test the gun
[2:39:37] <%tusk102> @TreeeFOX 1 cent
[2:39:40] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> stream brownies?
[2:39:40] <%Owkono> She hid the poop well
[2:39:40] <+AtlasMcCoy> Pat got the secret toy already
[2:39:41] <%crazyspartan214> IT COULD BE CORONA!!!
[2:39:42] <%TIME_PUNCHER> drug brownies
[2:39:44] <+TaurusOxford> @einherjarvalk he has it.
[2:39:44] <%tusk102> a fuckin penny
[2:39:45] <Oxybe> IT COULD BE UNIONS
[2:39:46] <+mans51> blizzard tho
[2:39:49] <%Louie_Salmon> They would do what they do now
[2:39:49] <%BeatBo_2> weave us a tail
[2:39:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> Weave us a tale, Bard Pat
[2:39:51] <%alcors_wisdom> we're off to slay the wizard the horrible wizard of marz
[2:39:52] <peachy996> Imagine EA
[2:39:53] <mankeytennis> Please do
[2:39:54] <BeefyQueefer> Weave Pat.
[2:39:55] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> So how is Doomguy air dashing? Is he just using his anger?
[2:39:55] <BeefyQueefer> WEAVE

[2:39:56] <indig0bird> "This is the tale of Bioware Montreal"
[2:39:56] <cryptidsyrup> how can paige complain, she checks mcdonalds for worms
[2:39:57] <peachy996> CAN YOU IMAGINE

[2:40:01] <%BeatBo_2> aw
[2:40:01] <%Piemen99> DO IT
[2:40:02] <Manwad> ill stay a while and listen to that tale
[2:40:03] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt shit companies would do it for free to give your blood exposure
[2:40:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pyr0_Fr0st yes
[2:40:09] <Mister_McDerp> thats is known
[2:40:09] <cybz98> @PatStaresAt They fucked over Obsidian and Human Head pretty heard
[2:40:09] <boogaleeboo> Bethesda corporate would literally ask if slavery is still legal somewhere
[2:40:09] <CappuccinoGuil> Imagine Netherrealm urgh
[2:40:10] <BeefyQueefer> We already knew that.
[2:40:12] <Yummy_Nukes> let id software do whatever they want and fuck up everything else
[2:40:12] <%ryome> Bethesda literally got people to pay them $160 for people to beat them up
[2:40:12] <TheAmazingClaytor> That Hard Timnes article, NaughtyDog in wake of COVID allowing employees to sleep at home"
[2:40:19] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Bethesda would slit your throat for a metacritic score
[2:40:24] <ImmaCanuck> SourPls
[2:40:26] <%grandark_z317> Bethesda is partially why I didn't buy this game.
[2:40:27] <nademonkey1100> they have woven that shit already
[2:40:29] <%arfsm95> @PatStaresAt what did you get from the challenges?
[2:40:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pyr0_Fr0st doomguy glares a space and it moves out of his way so he can get to the demons
[2:40:31] <TheAmazingClaytor> SourPls
[2:40:32] <peachy996> I want to see what horrible shit EA tries to pull if Unions were a thing
[2:40:38] <%tusk102> @TIME_PUNCHER is that a joke about new vegas
[2:40:40] <zipfile777> BFG DIVISION
[2:40:41] <+AtlasMcCoy> Its a shame you cant customize who you fight here
[2:40:43] <%bread_assassin> Never forget the three Bs of game devs, everyone. They can do no wrong.
[2:40:43] <HyperBomb21> SourPls
[2:40:44] <Zebroneath> Wolfenstein flopped and Fallout mega-flopped
[2:40:48] <peachy996> Cuz you know they will go hard and go big
[2:40:54] <Dutchpotato> Man I’m so excited to see how they fuck up the new fallout 76 update in a couple weeks
[2:40:56] <%Valdorick> It kills Tyrants
[2:41:05] <%FlyguyJP> Unmyker just Deletes a single enemy super fast
[2:41:05] <%tusk102> unmakyrs for murdering bosses @PatStaresAt
[2:41:05] <%TreeeFOX> Bethesda would take that blood and sell it for $60, not including the DLC.
[2:41:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt it uses BFG amo
[2:41:11] <%TIME_PUNCHER> @tusk102 mehbe
[2:41:12] <+NitronStreams> For when you absolutely positively have to kill every mother fucker in the room
[2:41:17] <ImmaCanuck> Sure can't wait for Elder Scrolls 6, amirite? sfoxLOL
[2:41:18] <+CSNG> Do combo and big number
[2:41:23] <+dante_must_die_exe> Only the new coop Wolfenstein flopped
[2:41:26] <+dante_must_die_exe> super hard
[2:41:30] <+mechslayer71> Why use it to kill tyrants when you have the sick ass Crucible animation tho?
[2:41:46] <zipfile777> MESS
[2:41:49] <Ultimatefool> Cyber mancubus without armor looks straight up NEKKID
[2:41:53] <1matheuw> so now pat has 3 super weapons
[2:42:02] <%Shadicara> Doom Guy lives a very full life
[2:42:03] <dking0000> Because the Crucible has like 5 pickups in the entire game
[2:42:05] <%tusk102> shit sucks
[2:42:08] <+Javaa01> You don't fry enemies raw
[2:42:11] <Mister_McDerp> it sux real bad
[2:42:12] <OverlordedK> heat blast is way better
[2:42:12] <nuane> supposed to use it on half dead enemies
[2:42:12] <+einherjarvalk> it's supposed to be a finisher
[2:42:12] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> @doc_ock_rokc So basically Zero Shifting but really angry edition?
[2:42:13] <+dante_must_die_exe> Mancubi are huge big orb
[2:42:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt sofen them up first then Fry them
[2:42:15] <+Javaa01> You gotta soften them up first
[2:42:16] <+kraajkase> it's based on remaining health
[2:42:16] <Onatamana> you have to weaken them first
[2:42:19] <heartlesshealer> it fries plasma shield real fast though
[2:42:20] <%linkster291> Yeah the beam is for finishing off weakened enemies.
[2:42:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Pyroclase yes
[2:42:22] <peachy996> Heat Blast is better
[2:42:23] <%D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt microwave beam uses less ammo when they're at low health
[2:42:24] <Midnight188> Oh hey did pat finally beat that one Slayer Challenge he didnt finish from his first play session?
[2:42:26] <%Niney_Who> They explode
[2:42:27] <+mechslayer71> @dking0000 There are 5 in the last mission alone lol
[2:42:27] <+Javaa01> Stunlock
[2:42:27] <%Th3SmartAlec> Explosion
[2:42:28] <Sundaysmiles01> explosions
[2:42:28] <%linkster291> They fry much faster.
[2:42:28] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it makes them explode
[2:42:29] <+Irridium> they explode
[2:42:29] <+GeneralHysterics> big boom
[2:42:30] <+kraajkase> AOE
[2:42:30] <RantingRavager> Explode
[2:42:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Explosion
[2:42:31] <nuane> so they blow up
[2:42:33] <CappuccinoGuil> big boom
[2:42:33] <+AtlasMcCoy> The point is its a shit mod
[2:42:34] <%BeatBo_2> they damage enemies around em
[2:42:35] <boogaleeboo> AOE damage
[2:42:36] <+maenos2> Tastier
[2:42:36] <%linkster291> And then go boom
[2:42:38] <xxmagonx> sr7nlock
[2:42:39] <$anita_dickin> they head asplod
[2:42:40] <+Neoepochx> I just use it to stun the Whiplash
[2:42:40] <Mister_McDerp> but doom is already full of finishers
[2:42:41] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt it's a big aoe explosion when they die
[2:42:42] <Zebroneath> Microwave could be way better.....it's not
[2:42:43] <rafaelba93> its shit
[2:42:43] <+Remery_> A little foreplay before the sex
[2:42:45] <RantingRavager> and i think it blows up those dumb energy shields faster
[2:42:45] <%Nobrev> they explode and deal damage to surrounding enemies
[2:42:45] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's not great
[2:42:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt also it burns though forcefields
[2:42:46] <+Neoepochx> Microwave is not that great.
[2:42:47] <%linkster291> You pull it on a big enemy they do big boom.
[2:42:47] <karl_rex> BIG NUMBER
[2:42:49] <heartlesshealer> Stunlocking
[2:42:49] <boogaleeboo> It is
[2:43:00] <Sundaysmiles01> its not a great option
[2:43:00] <+Javaa01> Microwave needs to be used accordingly, not willy nilly
[2:43:00] <$megamonmon123> the microwave sucks
[2:43:02] <RyanTheRecluse> they explode and if something is rushing you it immobilises them
[2:43:02] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Where is Cerebral Bore
[2:43:03] <%EtheralFlameX> heat blast is an expolsion and extra damage
[2:43:04] <+ElectricFoxLex> It also stunlocks bigger demons
[2:43:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> The explosion is useful. Softening them up saves time and cells.
[2:43:05] <$anita_dickin> its not the best
[2:43:06] <%Shadicara> @remery_ LUL
[2:43:09] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt Just use it on whiplashes whien they are the only enemies
[2:43:10] <+mans51> PepeHands
[2:43:12] <%Th3SmartAlec> does DOOM still crash?
[2:43:17] <Ultimatefool> I spent a mastery token on Microwave, soooo worth skipping that shit
[2:43:19] <$megamonmon123> did he put in the password?
[2:43:19] <%tusk102> wowie
[2:43:21] <rosemon5001> have you checked outside the station?

[2:43:28] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> ho does doomguy get demon prisoners of he murders every demon he comes across
[2:43:30] <%realm_forge> The other upgrade is way better
[2:43:30] <%Pyroclase> you have four more levels
[2:43:35] <dking0000> @mechslayer71 I don’t count those respawning ones, for most of everything else there’s very little to pick up. The BFG is the emergency, the Crucible is big emergency.
[2:43:35] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Doom Eternal is thr best Turok game in decades
[2:43:39] <Azure_Storm> Did you ever read the book titles?

[2:45:42] <Mrbaconator> no that's how much you ended at with
[2:45:43] <%alcors_wisdom> you only start with what you had left
[2:45:43] <%Shadicara> Metal for the metal gods
[2:45:44] <Sol_Install> safe it
[2:45:44] <+Javaa01> Nah, you start with whatever you had leaving the last level
[2:45:45] <%Niney_Who> DANTE'S INFERNO BULLSHIT
[2:45:45] <%GraceTBM> @PatStaresAt you start with whatever you had at the end of last level
[2:45:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt What if your sword ran on batteries
[2:45:47] <ittla> all those question marks make me anxious
[2:45:50] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt The pips don't recharge between missions
[2:45:51] <byrneson> your pips carry over from level to level
[2:45:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> @flyguyjp Reverse it. Mass destroyed souls.

[2:46:00] <CappuccinoGuil> @TIME_PUNCHER not the world-eater, the other demons gathering at the gore nests
[2:46:01] <%spiritofmojave> He cri lava
[2:46:02] <%Louie_Salmon> Is it moving?
[2:46:02] <Tucker0603> poor dude
[2:46:02] <ImmaCanuck> BibleThump
[2:46:02] <%ShichiNoBushi> That's pretty metal.
[2:46:02] <boogaleeboo> Pat this is hell

[2:46:18] <%Niney_Who> Picking it up yes
[2:46:18] <CappuccinoGuil> Pickups
[2:46:18] <+GeneralHysterics> no, this is in hell. Khan makyr had these factories built after the sentinels cleared out the demons
[2:46:19] <RyanTheRecluse> Time for the worst encounter in the entire game localised entirely within Nekravol
[2:46:20] <Visorak6> correct
[2:46:23] <%Th3SmartAlec> BFG ammo?
[2:46:23] <heartlesshealer> Sword only regens from sword pickups
[2:46:24] <%alcors_wisdom> other than RIP AND TEAR? yeah
[2:46:28] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt This is just straight up hell not Argent D'Nur
[2:46:28] <heartlesshealer> and ammo cheat
[2:46:30] <%Louie_Salmon> Other than uh
[2:46:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> ...yes?
[2:46:32] <CappuccinoGuil> Crucible has limited ammo
[2:46:32] <boogaleeboo> This is where Argent outsourced energy generation Pat.
[2:46:33] <+Javaa01> Pickups are the only way you're ever gonna get more sword juice
[2:46:34] <pede2011> This is hell dude, not Argent D Nur
[2:46:35] <+AtlasMcCoy> Instead of boss fountains, they just put a bunch of shit enemies to farm resources off of
[2:46:36] <%Shadicara> Are you just in Doomguys mind??
[2:46:36] <LeeOhX> He commin
[2:46:37] <Ultimatefool> @RyanTheRecluse Which one
[2:46:38] <$megamonmon123> yeah
[2:46:39] <nademonkey1100> its a 1 hit kill weapon

[2:46:47] <gunzerkingdunce> Sword is the for real, oh shit button
[2:46:48] <%Louie_Salmon> Yeah no way to Regen your shit other than getting the shit
[2:46:50] <%arancet> yes pat, getting shit regens shit
[2:46:53] <BeefyQueefer> "No way of regenerating the shit other than getting the shit."
[2:46:53] <$megamonmon123> its pick up only like the bfg @generalscpatton
[2:46:54] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> uh........... getting the shit?

[2:47:06] <%D00msDayDan> @PatStaresAt that's his left, not yours
[2:47:07] <%SkyPirateArcane> @PatStaresAt Left side means his left, not yours
[2:47:07] <peachy996> UGH HIS LEFT

[2:47:40] <%Lion_kun> from the right
[2:47:41] <%Louie_Salmon> I had to retry this do much because I thought it was your left, not the demon's left arm
[2:47:48] <TheAmazingClaytor> SPEEN
[2:47:51] <$megamonmon123> oh he doesnt have infinate micromissles yet

[3:17:38] <peachy996> Is it the one where you catch his fist
[3:17:40] <Visorak6> they just want you to see the kill
[3:17:43] <%FlyguyJP> LORE
[3:17:44] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Yeah but the One where you aim at the Marauder's feet is super cool you'd love it
[3:17:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt no they want the cool aim at feet glory kill pat
[3:17:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> But we WANT that Glory Hill
[3:17:48] <boogaleeboo> robot tank man is the one he needs
[3:17:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Cool
[3:17:50] <BeefyQueefer> more like Poon Hunter lmofa
[3:17:51] <Yummy_Nukes> this is a bad time to be eating a medium rare steak
[3:17:52] <boomstickery> looks its pat in the middle getting owned
[3:17:54] <StarvingPenguinGod> the hoverboard one
[3:17:54] <ringabal> YEAH HELL PARTY
[3:17:55] <trianglehat> olde timey doom
[3:17:58] <jase__x> That's pat
[3:17:59] <%D00msDayDan> the demon on the left is like "you hear about souls?"
[3:18:00] <%Th3SmartAlec> Yeah, Glory Hill, that's right
[3:18:01] <%weissguard> It's PAT
[3:18:04] <TheAmazingClaytor> Doom-eth
[3:18:05] <nademonkey1100> people i think are mixing up the doom hunter and the marauders
[3:18:06] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Why are you being choked out by demons?
[3:18:08] <%dekkitout> Guy in center looks a little like Pat
[3:18:11] <xinexes> why is PAT in that picture
[3:18:19] <%FlyguyJP> Efficient Demon Production
[3:18:23] <%Aracon_> vineThink
[3:18:26] <%Mornaka> that was definitely Pat
[3:18:33] <ringabal> The Well being the final Boss Pit in 2016
[3:18:39] <%FlyguyJP> So.... Hell Juicve
[3:18:49] <%dekkitout> I bet Woolie's in the background with a jetpack
[3:18:54] <Mister_McDerp> demon + wraith = BIG energy
[3:18:55] <FG_Leo106> how far in the game is this guy?
[3:18:57] <+NitronStreams> SWORD
[3:18:58] <King_Wolf_Rigger> So it's powered by an orphan's heart. Got it.
[3:19:01] <%Niney_Who> FAMINE MODE OH NO
[3:19:03] <%FlyguyJP> Heaven came along and make Hell more efficient
[3:19:11] <R3c0n31> Indeed, they we literally WEAKER then they are now and Doom Guy dont care
[3:19:14] <Monkeyweed21> They Minmaxed Hell
[3:19:14] <Gi_judd_617> The marauder was my only disappintment. Hewas advertised as Vergil, he became a nuissance.
[3:19:17] <%D00msDayDan> famine makes you realize how dependent on glory kills the game is
[3:19:17] <boogaleeboo> Yeah but they are immortal now so, you know, YOLO
[3:19:18] <Visorak6> I mean theyre saving their race
[3:19:26] <Visorak6> what do theyc are
[3:19:28] <Longfang91> Yeah, the Makyr are kind of assholes
[3:19:33] <$PaleBloodInk> Writing the codex entries for this game must be one the most thankless jobs.
[3:19:33] <Monkeyweed21> They Minmaxed and optimized hell pat
[3:19:33] <heartlesshealer> obtain secret
[3:19:35] <+JustToWatch> honestly it works out pretty well for the maykrs
[3:19:38] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt A race using Argent energy for profit sounds kinda familiar huh?
[3:19:41] <osiris1260> To be fair, they kinda have things under control
[3:19:41] <heartlesshealer> cube hole?

[3:20:46] <%cylish> This feels like the story of tobacco, it was a leaf that the locals smoked and sure it wasnt good for you but its not like everyone was doing it all the time, then americans came in and industrialized that shit
[3:20:54] <%grandark_z317> What's the deal with Commander Keen?
[3:21:01] <%FlyguyJP> Crushers don't even phase doomguy so much as inconvenience him

[3:26:43] <%ShichiNoBushi> She had a bad spine. Scoliosis.
[3:26:43] <Visorak6> demons NEVER deliver on the spirit of the deal
[3:26:44] <%hmgirlpopuri> @PatStaresAt It's her Employee of the Month statue
[3:26:48] <TurtlesAndTentacles> is she from this game?
[3:26:49] <Mister_McDerp> they gave her MANY legs
[3:26:50] <%EtheralFlameX> She could have got a jetpack with legs
[3:26:52] <%Valdorick> Her legs were broken, so they gave her 8!
[3:26:52] <peachy996> But at least she got a statue!
