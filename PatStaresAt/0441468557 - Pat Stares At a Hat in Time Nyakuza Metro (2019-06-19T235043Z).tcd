[0:15:17] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 update on that dnd game. The fighter woke up in the inn after being knocked out by poison, and dragged back by the party. As soon as he wakes up, he looks for the seediest bar in town, so he could get some quest leads. "You mean the ones that were in the inn you woke up in?" "No, the grimy ones" he then immediately tried to fight some redbrands, despite being alone, lv2, with no weapons or armor. Just 1 redbrand can out dps him with single attacks, and there's 4. With multi attack.

[1:08:23] <+BorinCorran> There were demons in the base.
[1:08:27] <TheRagingLeo> @AngriestPat what difficulty are you playing on?
[1:08:28] <%Diabetic> what difficulty?
[1:08:28] <SeruraRenge> @Tekaii00 Yes and it's actually really good but Doomguy doesn't care about the plot
[1:08:29] <derekwst3> im the devil
[1:08:31] <%cherubs_anonymous> Mars Hell
[1:08:33] <Bek_359> @SeruraRenge Well, there's also the stuff about Doom Slayer being from a world that already got eaten which MIGHT be a previous Doom game, but it's intentionally unclear and doesn't matter.
[1:08:34] <%logoth_> Mars is haunted
[1:08:34] <%GabeSweetMan> KILL HELL
[1:08:35] <%Dr00_PhD> Darin Depaul Kreygasm

[1:08:49] <dukenux> FUCK YOU PLOT
[1:08:49] <%Zamorouskiwhich> "Here is the story: HOES- I mean, Doomguy mad!"
[1:08:50] <%king_wragles> god I love this game
[1:08:50] <%spiritofmojave> Shutup Sam Fisher
[1:08:50] <+EySoyCoco> YEYEYE
[1:08:51] <deviljhojho94> Bringer of pain
[1:08:52] <%ElenaManetta> Oh cool I'm all caught up
[1:09:00] <Ion_Laser> Doomguy: FUCK YOU TIME FOR MURDER
[1:09:01] <Meekest> One of my favorite parts of Doom is how Doomguy just ignores the entire narrative
[1:09:03] <Bek_359> There is a story but your character actively doesn't care.
[1:09:05] <VritraReiRei> Cool Story Bro!
[1:09:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah, no time for monologuing
[1:09:07] <@lewdskeletor13> It’s actually a pretty decent story
[1:09:10] <derekwst3> punch boy
[1:09:14] <hericknhx> The story is very good if read the documents but hey, schut shit amaright 4Head
[1:09:15] <%arcaderabbit48> DOOM feels like one of those horror games where you get to be the unstoppable horror
[1:09:15] <+Cityscape17> time for the best weapon!
[1:09:15] <42nfl19> @AngriestPat Is there anything more you need to know thatn "Rip and Tear"? Nope, then move on!
[1:09:15] <NumbusPlays> GUN
[1:09:16] <deviljhojho94> NOW THE GAME BEGINS
[1:09:16] <NeonIceCavern> But what is the political climate of hell like?
[1:09:19] <%darcfowler1995> Dumb robot man get dead that is your
[1:09:19] <Kristoffers> the best characterization
[1:09:20] <%Grimlockfly> Doom boy is bes boy
[1:09:22] <%abakkus> the most i understand about doom's plot is your character is the debug menu for demon problems
[1:09:23] <$valriot> Doomguy is an Anti-Plot machine inside a game that has a plot
[1:09:23] <SeruraRenge> TURN ON CLASSIC VIEW
[1:09:25] <dukenux> >reading in Doom
[1:09:28] <+hax_metatron> Chapter 2: Shotgun
[1:09:29] <%MightyMaxT> The best part is that Doom Guy hates plot
[1:09:29] <%meltdown547> Time to shotgun: Fuck off, take your shotgun.
[1:09:29] <romanticzomedy> doomguy is also qualified to be pope
[1:09:29] <Kraahka> There's a lot of background lore that is actually pretty interesting
[1:09:30] <Moonlight_Grimoire> The shotgun is great in Doom
[1:09:30] <AoG_JarlRaven> the meta narrative is actually pretty compelling
[1:09:33] <dukenux> can i kill demons with a book?
[1:09:33] <%fFailureatlife> the thing is is that the narrative of this game is solidly designed for this gameplay
[1:09:36] <shotgunspaghetti> i cant wait for the first fucking crunch of the music
[1:09:37] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat which shotty upgrade you going with first? burst is my personal favorite
[1:09:37] <Kristoffers> lol
[1:09:40] <shotgunspaghetti> HERE WE FUCKING GOOOOO
[1:09:45] <%arcaderabbit48> As opposed to safe levels of demonic presence?
[1:09:46] <bomfiz> what difficulty is pat playing on?
[1:09:48] <%shurtal> the fact you get the shotgun like 4 minutes after starting the game is the correct move
[1:09:49] <lambretime> Unsafe levels of FRAKING DEMONS?!
[1:09:53] <+gimmickypizza> It’s doom
[1:09:53] <bearalin> Boom!
[1:09:54] <derekwst3> that's demonist
[1:09:54] <%shurtal> Hurt me More?
[1:09:55] <Ion_Laser> @bomfiz hurt me plenty
[1:09:58] <dukenux> dododododo
[1:09:59] <Darkrenai> What is a safe level of demons
[1:10:04] <%fFailureatlife> hurt me more snake
[1:10:08] <@lewdskeletor13> Can’t wait to kill Heaven in the sequel
[1:10:08] <+Jimboq> so wet and gooey Kreygasm
[1:10:08] <+BorinCorran> See this is why Doom is fucking awesome. Most games have you with a machine gun. Doom says fuck that shit, they give you a Shotgun to start after the pistol.
[1:10:10] <Bek_359> @lambretime The UAC has weird priorities.
[1:10:12] <dukenux> FIFA HQ?
[1:10:21] <%HentaiSenpai9K> apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[1:10:27] <%Niney_Who> Use Keyboard then nerd
[1:10:28] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Doom has always been unintentionally comical
[1:10:31] <%vaporousTippler> SNES version was the best version.
[1:10:31] <%Niney_Who> Get your Gamer Cube
[1:10:32] <RupanSen> but aim bad
[1:10:33] <lambretime> @Bek_359 I can see that bit FUCK...
[1:10:38] <Ion_Laser> gotta circle strafe them cyber demons
[1:10:38] <%spiritofmojave> even though movement is seamless now apatGoblin
[1:10:41] <SeruraRenge> ....how is that not easier on a mouse and keyboard?
[1:10:47] <MrDonTacos_> i just got here, what happened to a hat in time?

[1:10:57] <@lewdskeletor13> @mrdontacos_ Game was borked
[1:10:58] <%arcaderabbit48> Because playing on a mouse and keyboard makes your hands feel like death
[1:11:00] <%meltdown547> What...
[1:11:02] <RupanSen> Zdoom version is best version
[1:11:04] <TheLakinessMonster> @MrDonTacos_ Hat in Time crashed
[1:11:05] <$KnivesEve> the jaguar version is the best version
[1:11:06] <AoG_JarlRaven> could there be a DOOM where you fight demons and angels?
[1:11:06] <Bek_359> @MrDonTacos_ Update fucked up

[1:11:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> YEAH!
[1:11:53] <%ParaSpitfire> In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. He chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace. And with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. And those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.
[1:11:53] <shotgunspaghetti> AH!!!!!!!
[1:11:54] <dukenux> oh wait, you can
[1:11:54] <tungstenviper> NOT WORTH IT

[1:12:29] <%DestroyerDJ8> i love that they added an option to put the guns in the middle of the screen again
[1:12:31] <TheLakinessMonster> The storytelling in Doom is very subtle.

[1:13:00] <+BorinCorran> Good, Heaven deserves it. It's full of Anit-Vaxxers.
[1:13:00] <Bek_359> @GarbageQueenEllie Apparently there's an energy crisis and their desperation has outweighed their common sense.
[1:13:00] <Youwereeatenbyalid> oh my god is Pat's OCD going to actually make him open the codex?
[1:13:01] <filialpails> it's certainly very argent
[1:13:02] <+BigBruthaThunda> ooo doom
[1:13:02] <%Deft_Thought> I like the fact that the Doom Slayer looks down at the corpse in the elevator.
[1:13:03] <shotgunspaghetti> @iwishthiswasicq refresh to check the new title if it hasn't updated
[1:13:08] <%fFailureatlife> i have heard very good things about doom eternal PogChamp
[1:13:10] <%Harawanagangsta> ID made this, A bunch of shell companies ham fisted fo76 together in 6 months
[1:13:12] <%Diabetic> I honestly think that if Doomslayer went on Mars without the armor he'd still be fine, because he would be so angry he couldn't breathe he'd make his own anger oxygen. @AngriestPat
[1:13:19] <bleugh> oh no no he's playing fps on a controller
[1:13:20] <Ion_Laser> @BorinCorran They would be up there? WutFace
[1:13:21] <%meltdown547> The amount of glory kills based on relative positioning and aiming is insane.
[1:13:21] <%MyDarkStorm> Your too slow
[1:13:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> @Bek_359 Hell does have some great Thermal reserves.

[1:14:45] <Bek_359> Shame that Serious Sam 3 ALMOST had the glory kill system but it's just kinda shitty for a few reasons
[1:14:45] <%averyoddjew> this game is fantastic
[1:14:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> Hat Kid was Doom Guy all along

[1:14:48] <lambretime> Murder!
[1:14:48] <ReiDuran> DEMON murder though
[1:14:49] <Kristoffers> Murderers Only
[1:14:51] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Doomguy is a force of nature protagonist
[1:14:51] <+lionstrate> murder is lame Kappa
[1:14:53] <%codecell23> Pat you're a sub par tank
[1:14:54] <%spiritofmojave> Murder woo!
[1:14:54] <Misterjablez> @AngriestPat Which version would you recommend more, PC or Console?
[1:14:54] <bleugh> can't murder a demon
[1:14:55] <+BigBruthaThunda> or cocaine
[1:14:55] <Ion_Laser> How did Polygon screw up playing Doom? That should be impossible
[1:14:55] <SilverFaustX> KLL KILL KILLLL
[1:14:55] <HanPaul> I only play farm sims; should still buy? Kappa
[1:14:56] <derekwst3> its not murder if they are demons
[1:14:57] <FatherGreyBeard> Murder is fantastic
[1:14:57] <%cherubs_anonymous> If you're dumb and lame you won't like it
[1:14:58] <TheRagingLeo> YAY MURDER
[1:14:58] <Moonlight_Grimoire> to think, Doom Eternal is going to be more fast pace than this
[1:15:00] <42nfl19> What about your love of the lord and cleansing all evil?
[1:15:01] <AoG_JarlRaven> I still liked Titanfall 2 more but DOOM is solid
[1:15:02] <%spiritofmojave> Same
[1:15:02] <%Solidnick18> YE
[1:15:03] <%ElenaManetta> Soccer moms who want to ban video games are coming for you RIGHT NOW, PATRICK
[1:15:03] <dukenux> LUL

[1:15:04] <deviljhojho94> yeyeyeyeyeye
[1:15:04] <NeonIceCavern> I love the murder that my murder murders.
[1:15:04] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> They're demons, not people. So it's not murder!
[1:15:05] <%shurtal> the speedrun of this game is hilarious
[1:15:06] <blackbookalpha> Pat plays Smash?
[1:15:06] <%fFailureatlife> ME TOO
[1:15:06] <$Sayie> Do you want a video gamey murder violence video game? Get Doom
[1:15:07] <TurtlesAndTentacles> between PS4 and Xbone which one would be better?
[1:15:08] <%iwishthiswasicq> It's 15 dollars on PS4 right now if you have plus.
[1:15:08] <%Diabetic> AMEN
[1:15:08] <King_Wolf_Rigger> It's not murder if they are demons. It's only justice.
[1:15:09] <deviljhojho94> OLD
[1:15:10] <%averyoddjew> but what about Dante?
[1:15:10] <cosmicdischarge> 1994
[1:15:11] <RupanSen> to kill all the nintendo demons
[1:15:12] <%gespenst25> A new challanger rips and tears until it is done.
[1:15:12] <%Guardiansaiyan> Demon murder is fine-ish...but I would rather murder from a DISTANCE thank you...
[1:15:12] <%MightyMaxT> I have been a fan since 2016
[1:15:13] <Ion_Laser> I fucking love Doom
[1:15:13] <+BorinCorran> Didn't some media guy throw a hissry fit because he did not enjoy Ripping and Tearing?
[1:15:14] <TheRagingLeo> you can kinda make him as a Mii tho
[1:15:16] <+DownPlayTwitch> Smash version HAS to look like OG Doom Box Art guy
[1:15:18] <%bread_assassin> Is there a pacifist route?
[1:15:19] <conflict1914> imagine glory killing mario
[1:15:19] <Kristoffers> gun characters are a bother
[1:15:19] <%miguelrod777> wasnt evn alive them
[1:15:20] <%NovaKnightmare> yey
[1:15:20] <@lewdskeletor13> Can you really murder a demon
[1:15:20] <OwlLightningMage> I want Steve Undertale in Smash Brothers Kappa
[1:15:21] <derekwst3> isn't this guy just a weird boy
[1:15:22] <+valkuma> If they put Doomguy in smash brothers he'd have to be so strong that he would be disabled in competitive play.
[1:15:23] <redial_nick> yes john dooman into smash
[1:15:27] <%Dr00_PhD> thats more years than my existence
[1:15:27] <$cureneckbeard> Demon murder can't be a thing unless murdering demons is illegal
[1:15:27] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYEYEYE
[1:15:27] <sazssich> is this game much easier with a mouse, like every shooter? Or are there gameplay elements who make it
[1:15:29] <goddamndavid> oh lord controller aiming
[1:15:29] <Ion_Laser> ye ye ye
[1:15:29] <dukenux> Cute
[1:15:30] <FatherGreyBeard> PogChamp

[1:15:32] <%spiritofmojave> CUTE
[1:15:32] <%theAncopro> you mean since bethesda invented the fps genre
[1:15:34] <sazssich> just as hard with a mouse
[1:15:34] <%Diabetic> I never got him to do the fist bump
[1:15:34] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[1:15:36] <%Solidnick18> i like when he fist bumps those
[1:15:37] <hericknhx> funkopops 4Head
[1:15:37] <MattTheSpratt> doomguy: "aw sweet a funko"
[1:15:37] <%GabeSweetMan> [sounds of happiness]
[1:15:37] <scrumbotime> Imagine, if we had those instead of funko pops
[1:15:38] <%arcaderabbit48> Is that a Funko Pop
[1:15:41] <shotgunspaghetti> HE REMEMBERS
[1:15:42] <dukenux> No
[1:15:47] <+valkuma> theAncopro are you that retarded? those were ID developers speaking
[1:15:47] <Kristoffers> his armor is so chunky

[1:15:52] <Kristoffers> street fighter alpha fat
[1:15:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> DOOM 2016 was the very first FPS Video Game
[1:15:56] <Enemy_In_Disguise> They made toys out of his life
[1:15:57] <Misterjablez> Funko WISHES they had such adorable Doomguy figurees
[1:16:03] <%theAncopro> na man bethesda said so at their conference
[1:16:05] <dukenux> I love John Doom
[1:16:05] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Bethesda invented Video Games
[1:16:13] <Misterjablez> I would unironically buy one of those Doomguy figures
[1:16:14] <TheRagingLeo> this is the exact opposite of hat in time. Kappa

[1:16:23] <hericknhx> Bethesda is a videogame
[1:16:23] <%MightyMaxT> Does the music kick in later or is it just kinda quiet?
[1:16:24] <%arcaderabbit48> Ah yes, my mistake. Funk Pops don't have such quality features as movable limbs
[1:16:24] <MattTheSpratt> just wait until the upgrades, pat :3c
[1:16:26] <%MagickBurritoh> That noise
[1:16:26] <shotgunspaghetti> @Misterjablez they actually have funko pops of 4 different space marines and the cyberdemon
[1:16:28] <%President_Miyazaki> Rahhhhhhh gets louder
[1:16:35] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat How confident are you Doomguy can get in a game that didn't allow "Die monster, you don't belong in this world" in the Castlevania trailer?
[1:16:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Yaaay murdeeeeeer
[1:16:36] <Flame_Water> I wonder if doom guy would consider GTAV a violent game
[1:16:37] <%Credfield_> i had to go for like half an hour; this ain't no hat in time
[1:16:49] <@lewdskeletor13> Doomguy aka BJ Blazkowics descendant

[1:16:54] <@lewdskeletor13> Allegedly
[1:16:57] <drugbustincat> WOOOOOOOOOOOOO DOOOOOOOOOOOOOm
[1:16:59] <$KnivesEve> OMG I forgot doom guy has grenades
[1:17:00] <%Diabetic> and Commander Keen
[1:17:01] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Fuck, I completely forgot grenades were in this
[1:17:03] <Kristoffers> @Credfield_ there was a bug
[1:17:03] <shotgunspaghetti> @Credfield_ he had a cutscene malfunction and he decided to switch it up
[1:17:04] <%fFailureatlife> @brave_sj i mean they let snake in and he loves murder
[1:17:04] <$cureneckbeard> I'm humming Grab Bag
[1:17:07] <%averyoddjew> subhuman plays for some reason
[1:17:07] <+valkuma> lewdskeletor13 Blazko is too weak for Doomguy honestly

[1:17:30] <%arcaderabbit48> pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew pew
[1:17:30] <SchroedingersFerret> Doomguy x Samus OTP
[1:17:34] <%MightyMaxT> Did Paige go sleepy sleep?
[1:17:37] <GarbageQueenEllie> I get the feeling DoomGuy doesn't even need weapons. They just make it more fun for him.
[1:17:38] <%schlager087> HiGh LeVeL pIsToL
[1:17:38] <$valriot> is this the kid from that dope new Commander Keen game, @angriestpat ?? PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:17:39] <%weissguard> I know that's a Doom track, but I am reminded of wacky woohoo pizza man adventures when I hear it nowadays.
[1:17:50] <Ion_Laser> BJ from the original timeline is definitely the ancestor to Doomguy
[1:17:54] <conflict1914> Doomguy but he's anime boy
[1:17:57] <%Credfield_> @angriestpat did you see the trumpet imp from the doot e1m1 mix as the pre order bonus for doom eternal
[1:18:03] <%ElenaManetta> I like it when you and Paige say dumb shit and then tell us to think about it
[1:18:03] <benjiFG> but you haven't checked the map
[1:18:03] <Ion_Laser> @valriot Kappa
[1:18:04] <gypsystranger> Samus is too powerful for doomguy
[1:18:04] <$cureneckbeard> Doomguy but the voice is Paige
[1:18:05] <blackbookalpha> I visited id's office, they have a 1:1 scale Imp statue made of wood, carved with a chainsaw
[1:18:05] <MattTheSpratt> @SchroedingersFerret the furthest that would go is the two of them meeting, giving each other a knowing nod, and then they go their separate ways
[1:18:07] <%arcaderabbit48> @conflict1914 So, DMCV?
[1:18:07] <@lewdskeletor13> @valkuma I mean he’s literally supposed to be BJs descendant in one game
[1:18:07] <+BorinCorran> Doomguy Harem anime.
[1:18:10] <MattTheSpratt> that is the upper limit of that ship
[1:18:11] <%spiritofmojave> Doom but bishi/stronk woman
[1:18:14] <Enemy_In_Disguise> Doomguy but it’s a lady.
[1:18:18] <Tekaii00> THats like asking for a kiryu with a morty voice
[1:18:21] <%MightyMaxT> Seriously though, Doom guy should never ever talk
[1:18:25] <+gerenago> Hat Girl's new DLC hat is a bit fucking extreme
[1:18:26] <%GohanEgret> @spiritofmojave so metroid? Kappa
[1:18:29] <JJMR322> did he kill paige and hes hiding the body?
[1:18:29] <%Diabetic> @Enemy_In_Disguise they're already doing that in the movie that will make no money
[1:18:39] <%vaporousTippler> Them Doom novels, though. Remember Arlene? And the Clydes?
[1:18:40] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I would love a Doomgal
[1:18:40] <ReiDuran> ...This is making me want to play Doom again.
[1:18:41] <%spiritofmojave> @gohanegret hey I'd take it
[1:18:43] <Ion_Laser> PogChamp
[1:18:44] <%Solidnick18> YE
[1:18:45] <GarbageQueenEllie> What if Doomguy put the SuperCrown on
[1:18:45] <%MagickBurritoh> YEYEYE
[1:18:45] <%Guardiansaiyan> the whole song
[1:18:45] <Run44forrest> doom guy has really bad social anxiety
[1:18:46] <Ion_Laser> YE YE YE
[1:18:47] <%brave_sj> @fFailureatlife Yeah but the point of most Metal Gear games is to avoid murdering. It happens in the game but it's not Snake's main deal
[1:18:47] <%Guardiansaiyan> come on!
[1:18:50] <Enemy_In_Disguise> @diabetic Thanks, I hate it.
[1:18:51] <%weissguard> PogChamp
[1:18:51] <$valriot> Doomguy has big Roblox OOFS in the new game
[1:18:52] <dukenux> PogChamp
[1:18:52] <PowerWeightedCell> Imp song is best dont @ me
[1:18:53] <Crankthulhu> !uptime
[1:18:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 18m.
[1:18:58] <MattTheSpratt> doomguy's character is basically someone let down so often by everyone they've tried to depen on that they've just given up on words or decorum
[1:19:00] <NeonIceCavern> Do you remember DOOM?
[1:19:00] <%meltdown547> @Enemy_In_Disguise Crash from Quake 3.
[1:19:05] <%GabeSweetMan> A Hat in Time Kiwami really went in a really different direction didn't it?
[1:19:07] <mastermidget23> Just got here. This is some tone shifted dlc for hat kid.
[1:19:07] <%LupaTheWolf> Doomguy and samus are basically the same, Doomguy has a murderboner for demons, and Samus has a murderboner for space pirates.
[1:19:09] <%arcaderabbit48> Okay yeah, this is really cute. Never played the original, or any DOOM, but I can appreciate the throwback
[1:19:09] <dukenux> I remember Shadow Warrior remake doing stuff like that too
[1:19:10] <Onillius> @GohanEgret Yeah
[1:19:16] <Enemy_In_Disguise> @meltdown547 Now we’re talking

[1:19:22] <%ElenaManetta> is this fallout
[1:19:23] <%Divryne> @AngriestPat You enjoy Nyakuza (Savage)?
[1:19:23] <@lewdskeletor13> Doom and Wolfenstein are probably my two fave shooters
[1:19:25] <%fFailureatlife> @brave_sj "You enjoy all the killing, don't you?" - Liquid Snake
[1:19:27] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> The problem with these bonus levels is all the models in this game were made for the main game's moody lighting
[1:19:35] <%mayorrev> ARMOR
[1:19:37] <%megabrogus> I really wish the demons in the bonus rooms were classic sprites
[1:19:39] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> not this universal light source nonsemse
[1:19:47] <42nfl19> But @AngriestPat you are the demons?
[1:19:54] <mastermidget23> @ElenaManetta Well it IS made by the inventors of the FPS. Bethesda.
[1:19:56] <%brickwall35> this hat game looks different than I remember
[1:20:09] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mastermidget23 blasphemy
[1:20:16] <+Darren716> Explosive all day
[1:20:19] <%Josef_Stryker> It'd be even better if the enemies in the classic rooms were sprites like they were in the Wolfenstein dream sequences

[1:21:02] <mastermidget23> @Guardiansaiyan Are you saying Bethesda would just straight up LIE to me at their own conference? Good sir.
[1:21:05] <+allups> 1st play through?
[1:21:05] <Run44forrest> charge shot tho
[1:21:14] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:21:15] <%Dr00_PhD> nope

[1:21:21] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> TIGER KNEE
[1:21:30] <%cvp5127> for style
[1:21:35] <+earthboy2k> so how are the porn mods for hat in time
[1:21:35] <$valriot> You can tell which mods suck in this game, based on the ones that returned in Eternal
[1:21:40] <Ion_Laser> @mastermidget23 Bethesda is built upon a stack of Lies and Fallout 76 whale money
[1:21:41] <%mayorrev> big chjunks
[1:21:42] <%Ranryu692> You said you were playing it the other day
[1:21:44] <%Guardiansaiyan> @mastermidget23 yes my good man! I say so!
[1:21:47] <BappoSama> 1st playthrough in 5 years basically.
[1:21:48] <@lewdskeletor13> Poor robot
[1:21:55] <+gravityactually> Do you normally play fps games with controller?
[1:21:55] <BappoSama> my mistake
[1:21:57] <%megabrogus> doom guy just jumped 6 feet in the air and kneed a demon in one move
[1:21:57] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @earthboy2k they broke the cutscenes so he's playing DOOM instead
[1:21:58] <%fFailureatlife> look i get that bethesda is great right now but we all do recognize that they were clumsily referring to the fact that id is part of bethesda right
[1:22:05] <BappoSama> My mistake, 3 years.
[1:22:08] <+BigBoy3535> Jesus fuck did this game come out 5 years ago?
[1:22:11] <%fFailureatlife> *bethesda isn't great
[1:22:15] <%arcaderabbit48> Feel free to yell at you? Don't worry buddy, I'm sure the rest of the chat is here for you
[1:22:16] <+future_famous_person> i fucking love this game
[1:22:18] <%Guardiansaiyan> @fFailureatlife we do
[1:22:22] <@lewdskeletor13> This game still looks great
[1:22:22] <+allups> god damn this game is so good
[1:22:23] <+BigBoy3535> @BappoSama Even that seems more than I thought
[1:22:24] <AoG_JarlRaven> Bethesda is being carried by literally every studio besides Bethesda Game Studios
[1:22:27] <GarbageQueenEllie> SCREEEAM
[1:22:28] <%Alazull> Pat thanks for the UI stuff in the beginner stream, really liking the way 14 is running now
[1:22:30] <+gimmickypizza> Doot
[1:22:33] <%brave_sj> @fFailureatlife Not nearly as much as Doomguy. Snake doesn't rip enemy soldiers' livers out through their mouths, he just stabs them
[1:22:38] <+gravityactually> Didn't this game get graphically upgraded compared to its trailer?
[1:22:39] <HawaiiAnthony> Pat playing an FPS always just feels like im watching something taboo
[1:22:50] <eco419> the bobble head thoD:
[1:22:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> @HawaiiAnthony we won't tell if you won't
[1:23:01] <mistermastergreg> @AngriestPat Hey Pat any plans to continue FFT?
[1:23:02] <+earthboy2k> playing with a controller is taboo
[1:23:05] <+Noxybaru> The pace of this game with a controller instead of M+KB is so different it gives me whiplash
[1:23:08] <%megabrogus> 2016 was not 5 years ago @BigBoy3535
[1:23:19] <%fFailureatlife> @brave_sj just make his weapons "energy based" and keep the explosives mission accomplished
[1:23:19] <@lewdskeletor13> They did a great job rebooting DOOM and Wolfenstein, makes me happy
[1:23:24] <%Josef_Stryker> DOOM Funkos apatSmug
[1:23:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I can't believe 2016 was 11 years ago
[1:23:28] <fairore> @earthboy2k on what earth cmonBruh
[1:23:28] <+BigBoy3535> @megabrogus Someone else said 5 and I was reacting to that
[1:23:30] <Enemy_In_Disguise> I still love how this is just Brutal Doom
[1:23:32] <HawaiiAnthony> @Guardiansaiyan im in your debt
[1:23:32] <BappoSama> @BigBoy3535 I mean, it's originally a 20 year old game that was just remade in 2016. It's pretty fuckin old, but still holds up to this day. :/
[1:23:35] <DeliciousManTitties> A controller when you have a mouse and keyboard is a sin against god
[1:23:35] <%JoveGar> Wolfenstein 2 is hot garbage tho
[1:23:38] <+BorinCorran> Smash is missing an FPS rep. Gotta be either Doomguy or Master Chief, and they already used the Microsoft pass on Banjo. That's not how it works, but I'll pretend it is.
[1:23:39] <+razielhex> Oh mhe just started this game didn't he?
[1:23:44] <+BigBoy3535> @AngriestPat When are we getting that dank paper mario stream?
[1:23:50] <%fFailureatlife> @gravityactually they basically removed a terrible filter that made everything yellow looking
[1:23:54] <%patriotrenegade> Damn one year of dumb bullshit
[1:23:56] <Dio_TR> wolfenstein you feel like a corn flake those games suck shit
[1:23:59] <+gravityactually> Ah that's what it was
[1:23:59] <+earthboy2k> A FFVII refresher playthrough would be nice
[1:24:03] <BappoSama> @BigBoy3535 Never.
[1:24:05] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY for MK11. Screw Nintendo. No way they're gonna let DOOMGUY glory kill Princess Peach.
[1:24:20] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY fits in MK11. Hell is literally the Nether-realm.
[1:24:20] <+BigBoy3535> @BappoSama I know, but it's a dream
[1:24:24] <%fFailureatlife> @JoveGar im glad someone else agrees, such a disappointment after The New Order
[1:24:28] <+gravityactually> Doomguy for tekken Kappa
[1:24:36] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I hope it is doom slayer in MK11 not Ash
[1:24:39] <GarbageQueenEllie> Doomguy really needs that Supercrown. I NEED to see it
[1:24:43] <+razielhex> it can be both.
[1:24:49] <%JoveGar> Wolfenstein 2 has maybe the worst modern shooter design I've seen
[1:24:52] <NickSwanson> it wont be ash
[1:24:54] <mastermidget23> @fFailureatlife It's kind of amazing that doom came out BETTER in looks and gameplay than the trailers showed.
[1:24:57] <AMajorTom> You and Paige and Plague should do a commentary track for the Doom movie with the Rock
[1:24:58] <%patriotrenegade> patriotrenegade subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months, currently on a 12 month streak! Your huge! Which means you must have huge guts! Rip and tear your guts!
[1:25:04] <%arcaderabbit48> Doomguy genderswap, but she's wearing the same armor so you can't even tell
[1:25:11] <%Kravedarknesss> Wolfenstein The New Order is a great FPS. I feel like The New Colossus stumbles in some of its designs but is overall a good game
[1:25:19] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY with SuperCrown already exists. It's DOOMGUY.
[1:25:24] <AoG_JarlRaven> New Order definitely trumps New Colossus
[1:25:27] <%fFailureatlife> @mastermidget23 its amazing what happens when the people making care
[1:25:34] <alwayspronking> very neutralized
[1:25:36] <+gravityactually> No kill like overkill
[1:25:37] <+razielhex> New Collossus just needs more boss fights and Old Blood-esque stealth and it'd damn be perfect.
[1:25:37] <%JoveGar> Wolf2 has three gameplay upgrades and all of them are pointless
[1:25:38] <%patriotrenegade> Demonic activity at unsafe levels. Like, at what levels is ANY demonic activity safe? @angriestpat
[1:25:41] <+future_famous_person> @Kravedarknesss colossus got better after a few patches
[1:25:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat I figured out how to play the cutscenes!
[1:25:48] <@lewdskeletor13> I love Wolfenstein and I really enjoyed its story. But Doom feels better to play. Love both games tho
[1:25:48] <%brave_sj> @fFailureatlife I do think Doomguy would be cool I just don't expect him to get in. As long as we don't get Steve I'll be happy
[1:25:48] <+future_famous_person> though the stealth still sucks
[1:25:49] <%NovaKnightmare> Doom makes me happy
[1:25:51] <%fFailureatlife> we've all seen that one DoomGal fanart right Kreygasm
[1:25:58] <GarbageQueenEllie> @patriotrenegade Academy Award shows
[1:26:04] <%patriotrenegade> GET UP IN THEM GUTS
[1:26:08] <%NovaKnightmare> does Hell count as an accident?
[1:26:09] <rearedlogarithm> Can't have accidents if everyone's dead, Pat.
[1:26:12] <AoG_JarlRaven> @fFailureatlife is it sfw?
[1:26:13] <%MyDarkStorm> Reset the Clock on that shit
[1:26:13] <Moonlight_Grimoire> it isn't an accident if you don't file the paperwork!
[1:26:15] <+Double_Tap_That> This end screen music
[1:26:16] <garbageheaphound> it just means everyone has been dead fro that long i bet
[1:26:17] <%MagickBurritoh> RIP AND TEAR
[1:26:18] <romanticzomedy> you................... did it
[1:26:19] <$cureneckbeard> They killed the guy who resets the accident counter :(
[1:26:20] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY doesn't believe in stealth; Old Blood B.J. was like Alpha Protocol level stealth.
[1:26:21] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:26:24] <conflict1914> shoot the people
[1:26:25] <TMulharin> D O O M
[1:26:26] <+BigBoy3535> huh, this chat is a lot slower than I'd expect for 1200 people
[1:26:26] <DelNoche> i hae parkour
[1:26:28] <AMajorTom> Shoot the demons
[1:26:29] <alwayspronking> when in doubt, RIP AND TEAR
[1:26:30] <HipHopAnonymous23> @AngriestPat do you ever not wear PJ pants?
[1:26:31] <mastermidget23> @fFailureatlife Between this, DMC5, Bloodstained, DOS2, it's kind of weird how often demons are involved!
[1:26:32] <%patriotrenegade> Just do what comes natural
[1:26:32] <%Solidnick18> Kill demons
[1:26:34] <%templar010> Doom, guy
[1:26:37] <romanticzomedy> shoot the demons until they die
[1:26:37] <%Fox_Rezard> Hey. so... FF14 do i still need to level Archer to a certain point to learn the DPS Increase cooldown?
[1:26:37] <%brave_sj> Shoot the demons until they die
[1:26:38] <%Niney_Who> Apparently someone in the discord figured out how to play the Cutscene via a Console Command in Hat in Time. @AngriestPat
[1:26:38] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat the next smash character is: Ace Combat Guy
[1:26:39] <Enemy_In_Disguise> You are the demons
[1:26:42] <+BorinCorran> Doomguy with the supercrown are like those genderswapped Jason or Michael Myers statues. Full on Why-Boner.
[1:26:44] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@razielhex) (warning)
[1:26:45] <%patriotrenegade> Do parkour
[1:26:49] <garbageheaphound> fair
[1:26:50] <%gespenst25> hot
[1:26:51] <%GohanEgret> yet
[1:26:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> shoot the shit. shoot the shit.
[1:26:51] <NeonIceCavern> Does Elmo wear his PJ pants?
[1:26:52] <%fFailureatlife> @AoG_JarlRaven is tape over the breasts to show off the muscle definition count as sfw
[1:26:53] <%Kravedarknesss> @future_famous_person I may have to go back and try it then. I just remember that some of the levels were extremely frustrating
[1:26:57] <SilverFaustX> yet
[1:26:58] <%ElenaManetta> When do we get to see Elmo naked
[1:26:59] <+gravityactually> There are pro smash players that wear pj pants to tournaments
[1:27:01] <+Estuko> LUL wearing pants
[1:27:01] <%miguelrod777> sell it on onlyfns
[1:27:02] <+razielhex> No Josons! You are teh daemons. Then Jon was a zombie.
[1:27:02] <eco419> :)
[1:27:03] <%megabrogus> there are walkthroughs on the internet pat dont make us work for you
[1:27:04] <%Solidnick18> Vega PogChamp
[1:27:06] <$valriot> VEGA PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:27:07] <%MagickBurritoh> mars has an ai
[1:27:07] <+Double_Tap_That> gooey
[1:27:09] <Tekaii00> Did hat girl get kidnapped like Haruka & Doom guy has to save her? LORE
[1:27:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> he wears real pants at Woolies house
[1:27:10] <%Dovahthing> Vega = bro AI
[1:27:10] <%kiiiirsten> If that couch could talk/cry...
[1:27:14] <%brave_sj> You have to pay for the premium subscription for that
[1:27:14] <Moonlight_Grimoire> VEGA is a bro
[1:27:17] <+braixhim> Vega BibleThump
[1:27:18] <+TONYOO101> wait, what happened to the CUBE?
[1:27:19] <antthefool> Vega is pretty cool
[1:27:20] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Fucking let us through
[1:27:20] <eco419> moon2CUTE thx vega
[1:27:27] <+DownPlayTwitch> I wish the E3 trailer didn't spoil that VEGA is back
[1:27:30] <antthefool> He’s a good boy
[1:27:31] <+Double_Tap_That> VEGA is best boi
[1:27:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Vega. Read aloud "The Catcher in the Rye" for the rest of the lp.
[1:27:35] <+razielhex> In Japan, Id shoulda called Vega M. Bison just to fuck with ;em.
[1:27:40] <%patriotrenegade> @angriestpat there’s an upgrade that shows you where the secrets are on the maps
[1:27:43] <+Noxybaru> I mean it was pretty obvious Vega would be back
[1:27:51] <%fFailureatlife> lmao stop hitting yourself
[1:27:54] <%arcaderabbit48> Is a glory kill anything like a glory hole?
[1:27:54] <eco419> moon2EZ
[1:27:56] <%tigerfang86> Kreygasm
[1:27:57] <AoG_JarlRaven> I also thought Vega was pretty foretold to return?
[1:28:02] <%Solidnick18> Gore Kreygasm
[1:28:06] <%brave_sj> VEGA's a cool guy glad he's apparently back in Eternal
[1:28:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat Look on your Discord I figured out how to fix hat in time for you
[1:28:09] <+future_famous_person> cyrGasm
[1:28:16] <mastermidget23> VEGA is such a great swerve. An A.I., overlooking a facility of workers that were worshipping demons, and he's powered by hell energy, yet he's COMPLETELY BENEVOLENT.
[1:28:22] <+razielhex> Glory kill == health (and with rune, armor). Chainsaw == ammo.
[1:28:25] <+Noxybaru> Doomguy saves a copy deliberately and onscreen
[1:28:26] <+BigBoy3535> What's it take to get in the discord, subscription?
[1:28:26] <shotgunspaghetti> imma need a full playthrough of this from you please
[1:28:27] <Run44forrest> I remember the weapon upgrades being hard to miss
[1:28:27] <%Kravedarknesss> @arcaderabbit48 it's basically the same thing to doomguy
[1:28:33] <+razielhex> Armor (with rune) == infinite ammo.
[1:28:33] <%fFailureatlife> remember when doomguy saves VEGA cuz hes rad?
[1:28:41] <mastermidget23> Yeah!
[1:28:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> OOOO
[1:28:42] <Run44forrest> oof clip him through the floor
[1:28:43] <+Pookiedaexzile> OIOOOH
[1:28:46] <SkyPirateArcane> Ooooh Doom! RIP N TEAR Motherfuckers
[1:28:46] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Don't mind that
[1:28:48] <mastermidget23> I hope that comes back in Eternal.
[1:28:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> THE FUCK
[1:28:52] <+DownPlayTwitch> Yeah but I would have rather the reveal be more meaningful than. Oh hey he is talking again during that trailer

[1:29:48] <%fFailureatlife> secrets PogChamp
[1:29:51] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat so what's the best weapon in the game and why is it the minigun?
[1:29:53] <+BigBoy3535> Wait I just realized I don't know anything about DOOM
[1:29:53] <+LegendaryButcher> cause satan is cool
[1:29:55] <+Noxybaru> u did it
[1:29:57] <eco419> woo
[1:29:58] <%ElenaManetta> DAS BOOT
[1:29:59] <%mayorrev> sekrit
[1:29:59] <%Solidnick18> das good
[1:29:59] <+BigBoy3535> Why are there demons on Mars?
[1:30:01] <Navitae> Hey Pat, habbin fun?
[1:30:02] <copyritetm> I think she is literally the stupidest villain ive ever seen in a videogame
[1:30:08] <+allups> i kinda want Doom guy to be the new Kratos
[1:30:08] <xamnotnef> did pat like bloodstained?
[1:30:09] <%themythj> themythj subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:30:10] <%fFailureatlife> @BigBoy3535 because shut up
[1:30:11] <romanticzomedy> @BigBoy3535 where else would they go lbr
[1:30:12] <flying_man_3> Shes evil because she has boneitis
[1:30:21] <%arcaderabbit48> @BigBoy3535 Because Mercury is already full up with angels
[1:30:22] <%Kravedarknesss> @bigboy3535 people opened a hell portal for that juicy hell gas
[1:30:23] <WillyFresh992> EA execs are calling lootboxes "surprise mechanics" now
[1:30:23] <worldbrand> i bet she practices gyromancy
[1:30:23] <%Taisuru> DOOOOOOM
[1:30:23] <%king_wragles> @SWindleFeD the real question is which minigun upgrade is better? The fire barrels or the tri-minigun?
[1:30:24] <+razielhex> and Robot Bishop is still Bishop 'cuz Lance Henrikson
[1:30:27] <copyritetm> doomguy is better then kratos
[1:30:35] <$Big_Dream> octopimp is playing judgement what ???
[1:30:38] <+allups> huh smarter maybe
[1:30:40] <+SWindleFeD> @king_wragles tri-gun, easy
[1:30:40] <Ion_Laser> @WillyFresh992 :D :D :D
[1:30:41] <Run44forrest> because thats where they built the hell portal to use the demon energy
[1:30:41] <mastermidget23> @BigBoy3535 This company solved an energy crisis by tapping into a rift to hell on mars. Hell routinely invades other dimension that try to do this sorta thing.
[1:30:42] <%fFailureatlife> weyland yutani opened a hell portal thats the story to doom
[1:30:43] <+allups> nah*
[1:30:50] <%tigerfang86> HOES MAD
[1:30:51] <%brave_sj> I hate this level because that fucking message is stuck on a loop as if it's really that important that you can't possibly ignore it
[1:30:52] <+Pookiedaexzile> Look I don't doubt that statement, but I wanna see Doom guy and Kratos fight
[1:30:53] <$cureneckbeard> hoes mad
[1:30:54] <%patriotrenegade> That’s just the chat
[1:30:54] <blackbookalpha> suprise mechanics and comparing it to Kinder Eggs
[1:30:55] <Navitae> If I randomly kick someone in the groin and justify it as a surprise mechanic; does that count?
[1:30:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Bitch be quiet
[1:30:57] <Run44forrest> is demon energy clean energy? is it good for the environment
[1:30:58] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat those are the mad hoes

[1:31:28] <+razielhex> @BigBoy3535 This game is the sequel to DOom64, which itself takes place after Doom2 (Doom 3 is its own continuity). Mars had already been victim to a dimensional gateway to the Hell-Realm on Phoboos and Deimos.
[1:31:29] <$rekinom> onlyafroGasm
[1:31:36] <romanticzomedy> is good game
[1:31:36] <%Solidnick18> i like that
[1:31:38] <+Noxybaru> We can go violent-er
[1:31:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat Did you just say "Buck Yeah" you dork?
[1:31:41] <AoG_JarlRaven> ehhh i've seen more violent
[1:31:43] <+YabbaTroll> !uptiem
[1:31:45] <%Remery_> quiettAww
[1:31:46] <eco419> Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[1:31:53] <+YabbaTroll> !uptime
[1:31:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 31m.
[1:31:54] <+flanchefx> all the weapons in this game have great kick to them
[1:31:55] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat its not violent its uber violent
[1:31:59] <%fFailureatlife> @razielhex thats a misconception sadly
[1:32:02] <+flanchefx> feels good to shoot stuff
[1:32:06] <Dio_TR> Doom guy is just REALLY ANGRY captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank
[1:32:06] <Buzzard42> it's also implied that Doomguy comes from an alternate version of this reality
[1:32:07] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY decided to just stay in hell for centurties killin'; demons cuz doomguy and he got so good at it that the demon world turned him into a boogeyman.
[1:32:09] <+flanchefx> even the assault rifle
[1:32:13] <alwayspronking> no, much later
[1:32:13] <+EySoyCoco> oh no
[1:32:13] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:32:14] <%Niney_Who> Not for a while
[1:32:15] <+gravityactually> Not for a bit
[1:32:16] <mastermidget23> @BigBoy3535 This one actually adds some neat backstory! Apparently THIS doomguy is from a dimension that was already conquered, and he's been WRECKING SHIT in hell for an untold, but implied super long time. The demons as a society are super worried about him.
[1:32:17] <+williss_> Not for a while
[1:32:17] <TechDragon_Z> Double Jump is much later
[1:32:18] <+geckosheer> the juggle dump
[1:32:19] <eco419> pat the lever
[1:32:20] <+DownPlayTwitch> not even
[1:32:20] <+future_famous_person> like halfway through the game
[1:32:21] <%king_wragles> 2 or 4 levels from now
[1:32:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> @angriestpat Who wins in a fight Doom Guy or Master Chief
[1:32:23] <+CronoMagnum> Jubble Jump
[1:32:28] <Moonlight_Grimoire> two more levels
[1:32:33] <%Niney_Who> 🎸
[1:32:33] <TechDragon_Z> Below you
[1:32:34] <%fFailureatlife> SourPls
[1:32:35] <Buzzard42> yeah Hell is terrified of doomguy

[1:33:04] <%Kravedarknesss> @razielhex doomguy was just so good at killing that they had to deal him in a coffin otherwise he would've eventually annihilated all of them
[1:33:07] <+future_famous_person> PogChamp

[1:33:20] <AoG_JarlRaven> :O

[1:33:26] <%fFailureatlife> @BigBoy3535 shut up tho
[1:33:27] <proto_char> Is this a blind playthrough?
[1:33:27] <%king_wragles> I think the wall takedown is new?
[1:33:28] <dredshift> Woah, Hat Kid got hardcore
[1:33:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> Can we get a Doom 2016 for Blood
[1:33:30] <antthefool> Holy shit I never saw that
[1:33:32] <%Gogogolem> @fFailureatlife Not its his pure rage.
[1:33:33] <%gespenst25> wtf
[1:33:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> all glory kills are contextual
[1:33:35] <%arcaderabbit48> Is there a reason Doomguy is so badass, or is he just that good? Like a Master Chief kinda thing, or what?
[1:33:42] <romanticzomedy> he's powered by rage
[1:33:45] <%king_wragles> @proto_char no, he 100% the game but that was years ago
[1:33:47] <%tigerfang86> Doomguy just hates demons
[1:33:49] <%Kravedarknesss> @bigboy3535 read Jorge Joestar. it explains everything
[1:33:49] <+razielhex> glory kills differ on demon type as well as angle to the demon.
[1:33:49] <Buzzard42> @arcaderabbit48 he's very angry
[1:33:50] <proto_char> Ah alright
[1:33:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Hoes Decapitated
[1:33:56] <%fFailureatlife> @arcaderabbit48 hes just sick awesome and hates demons
[1:33:57] <Ion_Laser> Hoes Dead
[1:33:59] <AoG_JarlRaven> @arcaderabbit48 I think he's just very angry
[1:33:59] <%tigerfang86> Doomguyin around
[1:34:02] <eco419> LUL
[1:34:10] <proto_char> Doomguy is just too angry to die
[1:34:10] <%mornerboi> official doomguy theme
[1:34:11] <Run44forrest> doomguy is manlet
[1:34:12] <+braixhim> lockdown is for the demons safety
[1:34:13] <+Pookiedaexzile> I like to think Doom Guy sings to him self
[1:34:15] <GarbageQueenEllie> Doom Guy Chaotic Good
[1:34:23] <%Gogogolem> Do you think Doom guy enjoys his job.
[1:34:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom Guy is the King of Manlets. The let is for letting you live
[1:34:33] <%mornerboi> @Gogogolem im almost 100% positive he fucking loves it
[1:34:34] <+YabbaTroll> @arcaderabbit48 theres actually a bunch of lore, lemme find you a vid on it, its really good
[1:34:36] <AoG_JarlRaven> Doom Guy probably counts to 4 and inhales/exhales
[1:34:39] <Moonlight_Grimoire> chainsaw is legit next room, lol
[1:34:44] <+razielhex> use your dfamned pistol on the zombies, jesus
[1:34:48] <dankdoobz> doom guy is jesus in power armor and he kills your sins with guns instead of the whole crucifixion thing
[1:34:58] <eco419> neverending ammo Kreygasm
[1:35:01] <+BigBoy3535> @arcaderabbit48 Maybe it'll be explained in the Commander Keen
[1:35:01] <mastermidget23> I like to think that Doomguy's armor has internal speakers that just generate synth-rock when he kicks ass.
[1:35:01] <romanticzomedy> doom guy would make the best pope
[1:35:04] <Buzzard42> @razielhex why would anyone touch the pistol
[1:35:08] <%Nobrev> FUCK THE PISTOL
[1:35:13] <deviljhojho94> Why use the pistlo lmao
[1:35:15] <deviljhojho94> its shit
[1:35:15] <%averyoddjew> double barrel?
[1:35:17] <benjiFG> but you did five mintues ago
[1:35:17] <%ElenaManetta> You can't use your dick
[1:35:18] <eco419> AMEN
[1:35:19] <Fabulich> All these crunching noises is making me hungry.
[1:35:19] <%Gogogolem> doom guy clocking into his 9 to 5
[1:35:20] <%Solidnick18> Jebaited
[1:35:21] <+MrWrann> What if you need ammo for later
[1:35:22] <Crankthulhu> You will run out of ammo?
[1:35:24] <+razielhex> The strongest thing is the goddamned telsa cannon or triple-barrel chaingun
[1:35:25] <worldbrand> wow
[1:35:25] <%shurtal> No Kill like Overkill
[1:35:25] <chron121> Will we finally have Woolie VS God 2: Heretical Boogaloo when Doom: Eternal Drops?!
[1:35:26] <+Snaketsu> VARIETY PAT
[1:35:26] <%FusRoDom> Because what if you need it later?
[1:35:28] <Ion_Laser> This is a Doom game use the goddamn shotgun
[1:35:28] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Because ammo is a consumable item
[1:35:28] <%JoveGar> imagine being so fucking stupid that you dont kill demon better
[1:35:29] <%MagickBurritoh> why did you use it earlier then
[1:35:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like being able to give a good pistol-whipping. That shit hurts like a bitch
[1:35:31] <+xijiy> Kill the enemies as hard as you can
[1:35:31] <%Yadogari> Pistol is fucking useless
[1:35:33] <+TheyTookMyBeard> @AngriestPat Always use the biggest gun, then the next biggest etc.
[1:35:35] <+flanchefx> gauss cannon is great in this
[1:35:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy isn't Jesus He's Moses, Leading you fuck ass Demons to hell and splitting chest cavities liek the sea
[1:35:36] <%arcaderabbit48> Because Doomguy's hate boner isn't a weapon
[1:35:42] <+TheyTookMyBeard> Then chain saw
[1:35:42] <$Zathas> WAIT, doesn't this go against the Pat syndrome of never using the good ammo?
[1:35:42] <%Gogogolem> Goes home to doom wife and doom kids.
[1:35:44] <%SilvaChariot0133> Strident promised me cat crimes, this is demon crimes >_>
[1:35:47] <g15835> how long y'all been on Doom? i was watching an early Judgement stream
[1:35:47] <Rezroc> The Chinshaw
[1:35:49] <%tigerfang86> FREE CHAINSAW
[1:35:50] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yeyeyeye
[1:35:51] <+Noxybaru> The chaingun fucking wrecks
[1:35:52] <+daisyyyy> Never play an ace if a two will do Pat
[1:35:53] <Ion_Laser> GROOVY
[1:35:54] <+razielhex> You literally havew to pistol zombies for some of the achievements
[1:35:58] <%fFailureatlife> @Zathas theres always ammo
[1:35:58] <%Kravedarknesss> @angriestpat the pistol has infinite ammo and what if you need those shotgun shots later
[1:36:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> Not one tree in sight
[1:36:02] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat why did they need a chainsaw on mars before there were demons?
[1:36:03] <%Solidnick18> That's good for killing demons
[1:36:03] <%gespenst25> Max has put out a video on Doom Eternal entitled "Yea...It's That Good"
[1:36:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> but we don't ned trees
[1:36:04] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Zathas It's not a survival horror game so Pat's Goblins are appeased
[1:36:05] <silvcrest> Variety is the spice of death y'all
[1:36:05] <+DownPlayTwitch> I wasn't paying attention, did he get the secret int he last room
[1:36:06] <romanticzomedy> @g15835 not that long
[1:36:08] <Goergorion> chainsaw GOOD
[1:36:09] <%arcaderabbit48> That's not even a space chainsaw, its just literally a chainsaw!
[1:36:10] <%Dingus_Tickler> Is DOOM Guy a Red Halo? Or a Green Mega-Man? atpRtsd
[1:36:10] <%averyoddjew> what a glorious future this is that they are on mars and STILL use chainsaws
[1:36:14] <eco419> lol ammo in a doom game LUL
[1:36:16] <hypecactuar> hows it goin chat!
[1:36:19] <mastermidget23> But how is the chainsaw against LIVING THINGS
[1:36:23] <+xijiy> Doomguy's hate boner is TOTALLY a weapon
[1:36:25] <worldbrand> doom (2016) more like mood (6102)
[1:36:32] <g15835> @romanticzomedy like 30 mins?
[1:36:33] <+YabbaTroll> @arcaderabbit48 any chainsaw is a space chainsaw if its in space
[1:36:38] <romanticzomedy> @g15835 ya thereabouts
[1:36:42] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom Guy would definitely fuck a Demon to death
[1:36:43] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat Pat the Consumable Goblins are just one room away, waiting. apatGoblin
[1:36:52] <%Gogogolem> @averyoddjew Can you think of a way to make a better chainsaw?
[1:36:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> but he chooses not to, because he cares about consent
[1:37:02] <g15835> @romanticzomedy great thanks
[1:37:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @YabbaTroll Huh. I can't really argue that
[1:37:11] <silvcrest> Don't forget about your regular grenades too
[1:37:14] <romanticzomedy> @hypecactuar that's a dope name, cactuars are indeed hype
[1:37:15] <+cameronfincher> what difficulty is Pat on?
[1:37:27] <%king_wragles> LUL
[1:37:28] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom
[1:37:35] <Ion_Laser> @cameronfincher hurt me plenty
[1:37:39] <%gespenst25> who'd have thought that huge a Bethesda published game would be less buggy than a small indie platformer.
[1:37:44] <eco419> Snap crunch gloop
[1:37:44] <%cameronfincher> yeet
[1:37:49] <%tigerfang86> I did too pat
[1:37:49] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Dom. Dom 4. Dom 4 Champaign
[1:37:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> I like that part too.
[1:37:53] <%averyoddjew> @Gogogolem laser chainsaw?
[1:37:53] <+future_famous_person> looks like normal difficulty
[1:37:53] <+razielhex> If you ever watched Mick Gordon's glorious 45 minute GDC presentation of how he made the music for this game, he dides provide a way to make the chainsaw better @Gogogolem
[1:37:54] <romanticzomedy> this is the part where they die
[1:37:58] <%spiritofmojave> That's a good part
[1:38:01] <+DownPlayTwitch> You can get the plasma rifle early here, also dont use the weapon mod until you get that or the machine gun
[1:38:01] <%NovaKnightmare> God I love this game
[1:38:02] <$Big_King_Coconut> Oh did you kill them? I must have missed that part
[1:38:05] <transporterthesequel> No way me too!
[1:38:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> What was YOUR favorite part of the trip?
[1:38:11] <$Zathas> It's an id game before a Bethesda game.
[1:38:12] <+YabbaTroll> doom lore, the chainsaws you find on mars are there only because of a shipping mistake, they were supposed to receive grinders but got chainsaws instead
[1:38:15] <antthefool> I love how imps maneuver
[1:38:26] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat just go across the tracks
[1:38:26] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom vs Cole Train from gears of War
[1:38:29] <eco419> :)
[1:38:31] <Youwereeatenbyalid> @YabbaTroll that's actually some good lore.
[1:38:38] <+razielhex> chainsaw Oil!?
[1:38:39] <mastermidget23> @YabbaTroll Wasn't that Doom 3 Lore? Or am I mistaken.
[1:38:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat is talking inthe 3rd person
[1:38:40] <+razielhex> OIL!?
[1:38:40] <%Gogogolem> Maybe doom guy has a one of those murder auras. Where his weapons of choice just show up in his vincity.
[1:38:45] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Oil??
[1:38:48] <Ion_Laser> @mastermidget23 yeah it was Doom 3 lore
[1:38:51] <+razielhex> That's goddamned petrol
[1:38:53] <eco419> Baba is doom
[1:39:00] <+YabbaTroll> @mastermidget23 I think its also in a codex in this one
[1:39:01] <+flanchefx> space petrol
[1:39:03] <alwayspronking> Hoes mad?
[1:39:04] <%tigerfang86> Hoes
[1:39:04] <%Dingus_Tickler> This game is a blast to play if you’re good at FPS games and being aggressive atpGood
[1:39:05] <Youwereeatenbyalid> Hat kid is mad
[1:39:06] <+braixhim> hoes
[1:39:09] <GarbageQueenEllie> demons is mad
[1:39:11] <Onillius> @razielhex no it's gasoline
[1:39:14] <mastermidget23> @YabbaTroll I accept this because it's cool.
[1:39:17] <$cureneckbeard> hoes mad nyannSmug
[1:39:21] <%weissguard> Doom Guy doesn't emit Killing Intent, he IS Killing Intent.
[1:39:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dooms Stand is his E1M1
[1:39:27] <+razielhex> in Mars they use the term petrol for gasoline
[1:39:31] <+razielhex> because British
[1:39:33] <%Dovahthing> DEMONS MAD
[1:39:34] <blackbookalpha> Baba IS You
[1:39:35] <eco419> BabyRage
[1:39:39] <+LegendaryButcher> come back to that room later
[1:39:49] <$cureneckbeard> Master Chief
[1:39:50] <%tigerfang86> he's so one dimensional it's endearing
[1:39:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> eeeehhhh
[1:39:53] <%mornerboi> doom guy is so one dimensional that he becomes multi-dimensional
[1:39:55] <%averyoddjew> pet his rabbit?
[1:39:56] <+DownPlayTwitch> he NEEDS to kill the demons
[1:39:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> Hate is a good motivator
[1:39:57] <+YabbaTroll> @mastermidget23 aw fuck im wrong, the codex says that it was smuggled onto mars, weak
[1:40:00] <%brave_sj> I MUST KILL THE DEMONS
[1:40:02] <@lewdskeletor13> THEY KILLED HIS RABBIT
[1:40:05] <%Solidnick18> SourPls
[1:40:06] <%Shady_Squid> Is he just some guy?
[1:40:06] <$cureneckbeard> Only a one-dimensional hero can defeat an extradimensional threat
[1:40:06] <%averyoddjew> oh wait... they killed it
[1:40:07] <%MagickBurritoh> Does doomguy ever talk
[1:40:10] <42nfl19> Master Chief use to be like that. Just kill all the aliens!!
[1:40:14] <+Pookiedaexzile> With his fist
[1:40:15] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@mornerboi) (warning)
[1:40:15] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY only cares about killing demons. He literally ignores the story and narrative the game builds.
[1:40:17] <mastermidget23> @YabbaTroll WHY WAS IT SMUGGLED THOUGH!?
[1:40:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doomguy still has more character then the ENTIRETY OF ANDROMEDA
[1:40:23] <romanticzomedy> doomguy is a wordless man of murder and mystery
[1:40:34] <+Pookiedaexzile> My question, Does doom guy have scars
[1:40:35] <+Ell1ot> I like Doom Guy way more than John Halo, Master Chef
[1:40:40] <eco419> Rage great motivator
[1:40:47] <+razielhex> He simply doesn't care about what's going on andf intentionally sabotages the story in several places by just destroying McGuffins
[1:40:54] <mastermidget23> @Pookiedaexzile He's got LOADS that you can see at the very start when he's naked.
[1:41:12] <+future_famous_person> LUL
[1:41:14] <%Solidnick18> oo
[1:41:22] <+saltyputblug> doom guy is a scar
[1:41:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @razielhex you mean he intentionally saves people from trouble by destroying demon summoning items
[1:41:31] <%spiritofmojave> @mastermidget23 nice
[1:41:32] <eco419> 1 hp Close call
[1:41:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> @mastermidget23 So he's fucking venerable perfect Character 10/10 fuck John Halo
[1:41:39] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat don't forget the glory kill challenge
[1:41:42] <+YabbaTroll> @mastermidget23 bro imagine how much power you have if your the only one within a 54.6 million mile radius with a chainsaw
[1:41:42] <+razielhex> What people is he saving? Everyone is already dead except Olivia.
[1:41:44] <$Big_King_Coconut> Pat please kill more demons
[1:41:46] <Studyman> is he playing on normal?
[1:41:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Put doom guy in Halo
[1:41:52] <+razielhex> he definitely dfoesn't save her
[1:41:55] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat whoops
[1:41:56] <+YabbaTroll> @mastermidget23 how could you not smuggle it in
[1:41:58] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Waiting for a demon to go "EEEEEeeeeee... OOOOOOOOOooooooooooo"
[1:41:58] <Buzzard42> I love that this game forces aggression by making enemies explode into health when you kill them at low health
[1:41:59] <+Improv__1> @Improv__1 is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[1:42:04] <Buzzard42> thus encouraging you to go HARD when you're almost dead
[1:42:11] <+Darren716> Isnt there a hidden pulse rifle in this level?
[1:42:11] <alwayspronking> DOOM SECRETOS
[1:42:12] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@BigBoy3535) (warning)

[1:42:54] <eco419> moon2D
[1:42:57] <+razielhex> there's a pulse rifle here and you wait to get it and then upgrade the pulse rifle.
[1:42:58] <+sixcubit> @AngriestPat it's sort of implied that Doomguy likes VEGA, since he saves it onto a disk instead of destroying all copies. i always found that odd
[1:42:59] <%Solidnick18> AAH
[1:43:00] <vanderbolt777> hard to believe Bethesda made this
[1:43:06] <+BigBoy3535> I just wanted to know if there was a change petition to get John Halo in Smash
[1:43:10] <+DownPlayTwitch> He is incapable of waiting
[1:43:11] <FalseEyeD> Controller NotLikeThis
[1:43:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @vanderbolt777 id Software made this
[1:43:15] <%king_wragles> OOOHHH, the assault rifle is the next weapon!
[1:43:16] <+Darren716> Yeah you could have gotten a pulse rifle upgrade instead

[1:44:04] <VritraReiRei> when was the last time you played this game @AngriestPat ?
[1:44:05] <%AnIcedCoffee> bethesda totally made this
[1:44:05] <romanticzomedy> gun status: got
[1:44:06] <eco419> i made it :)
[1:44:07] <mastermidget23> I think that Doomguy does care about people, but he's very, VERY certain that the best way to kill them is to focus entirely on killing demons. And thankfully, he knows how to be in the right place.
[1:44:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Darkred28 No ID is not related to that team
[1:44:07] <%joylent_blue> no i did :)
[1:44:08] <antthefool> God I love how all the weapons in this felt
[1:44:08] <+YabbaTroll> i think there is a secret gun in this area
[1:44:09] <+razielhex> IF YOU HAD WAITED.. You'd have SNIPER mode
[1:44:10] <sjcodan> DOOM is best played with subtitles OFF
[1:44:11] <+DownPlayTwitch> Backtrack time for big secrets
[1:44:12] <+future_famous_person> i made this game :)
[1:44:13] <deviljhojho94> it was me :)
[1:44:15] <+Pookiedaexzile> doomguy does say please, he's a good boy
[1:44:20] <+Ell1ot> but is it the shotgun?
[1:44:24] <$Big_King_Coconut> gun has too much blood on it, find a cleaner one
[1:44:25] <+LegendaryButcher> backtrack for plasma
[1:44:26] <eco419> is me john romerow :)
[1:44:29] <CSNG> I love the repeating missle upgrade on this gun
[1:44:29] <Ion_Laser> Bethesda only published this. If Bethesda developed a Doom game they would have found a way to screw that up
[1:44:29] <Buzzard42> @razielhex how are you consistently wrong about everything LUL
[1:44:29] <%spiritofmojave> Bethesda invented shootey mctooty :)
[1:44:32] <Buzzard42> it's all about missiles
[1:44:33] <+razielhex> Battle Rifle Sniper Mode is *great*
[1:44:36] <deviljhojho94> Its me, john doomguy :)
[1:44:37] <+DownPlayTwitch> nevermind
[1:44:39] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> The only subsidiary of Bethesda Softworks (rather than sister-company to it under Zenimax) is BGS.
[1:44:43] <vanderbolt777> what difficulty are we playing on?
[1:44:45] <FalseEyeD> Subtitles are ridiculous here. They just unload the entire paragraph.
[1:44:55] <Moonlight_Grimoire> the doom assault rifle is probably my favorite LMG in a game
[1:44:56] <sjcodan> Pat its not recoilng
[1:45:00] <sjcodan> Thats like no kick
[1:45:01] <Ion_Laser> @vanderbolt777 hurt me plenty
[1:45:02] <Jolnir> Oh this is that bethesda game
[1:45:11] <eco419> i love that rifle an the rockets mod
[1:45:22] <%Lion_kun> hey
[1:45:25] <%Lion_kun> this isn't yakuza
[1:45:28] <deviljhojho94> A reckoning of lead is coming
[1:45:31] <%Lion_kun> did pat trick us
[1:45:34] <Jolnir> no its hat in time
[1:45:35] <mastermidget23> @Moonlight_Grimoire I want to dispute that but nothing comes to mind. Everything about it is great.
[1:45:35] <RickyRelucent> Try executing nibbas net to walls
[1:45:35] <shotgunspaghetti> i think there was a door he missed
[1:45:39] <Onillius> "not the chainsaw" "YES THE CHAINSAW" ~boomstick, Death battle
[1:45:40] <%Dingus_Tickler> @sjcodan It’s because it’s DOOM Guy handling the gun. For everyone else, its recoil
[1:45:41] <%genowyn> genowyn subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 
[1:45:43] <+razielhex> isn't this where one of those big bubbas come in?
[1:45:43] <romanticzomedy> this is clearly bloodstained
[1:45:44] <%Remery_> punched his asscheek off :/
[1:45:48] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Jolnir Yes, this is the first Video Game ever. Conceptualized, Developed, and Published by Bethesda Game Studios.
[1:45:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Kill Shield bitch first... He insults the spirit of Doom
[1:45:53] <eco419> hat in time dlc :)
[1:45:55] <%tigerfang86> YEAH DO IT
[1:46:01] <%SergeEXE> YEYEYEYE
[1:46:01] <sjcodan> @Dingus_Tickler I know, I was just saying he used the term KICK wrong
[1:46:01] <+future_famous_person> LUL

[1:46:09] <%miguelrod777> IM OUT
[1:46:09] <blackbookalpha> Hat In Time DLC looks GREAT
[1:46:11] <FalseEyeD> Bloodstained, a Bethesda game.
[1:46:11] <deviljhojho94> YES
[1:46:12] <%brave_sj> WHO'S MAN AND A HALF
[1:46:12] <%fFailureatlife> SourPls

[1:46:13] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pog
[1:46:14] <eco419> Kreygasm
[1:46:18] <Ion_Laser> @Lion_kun Nope. A Hat in Time update broke some of the cutscenes so he switched to Doom
[1:46:25] <%Tojan89> Tojan89 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Rip and Tear til its done!
[1:46:26] <+BigBoy3535> Jesus fuck, I love the fact that they ran away from him
[1:46:36] <%Lion_kun> boy is this tonally different from hat in time
[1:46:37] <%sshen> I'm digging this commander keen sequel
[1:46:47] <antthefool> His deadliest weapon his hands
[1:46:53] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Hey @AngriestPat how bout them BetterTTV Channel Emotes?
[1:46:53] <$cureneckbeard> Pat announced he was playing the Hat in Time DLC and accidentally triggered 「CRAZY TALK」
[1:47:02] <FalseEyeD> Is this a mobile game? Like Commander Keen always was?
[1:47:03] <$Big_King_Coconut> the demons are laughing at you "did you see that idiot fall into that hole?"
[1:47:05] <blackbookalpha> DOOM Guy and Hat Kid would be a lol crossover
[1:47:10] <Jolnir> how come you cant drive halos in this game, microsoft did it
[1:47:15] <Ion_Laser> @FalseEyeD Yup Kappa
[1:47:16] <Jack8274> Why Pat play with controller? Is his baby hands to small for a mouse?
[1:47:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> See now I get the difference between John halo and Doomguy. Halo is just a Fighter....but everybody wanna get wet liek a Barbarian
[1:47:23] <+razielhex> you can run doom on practically anything, so yeah, DOOM is on mobile
[1:47:23] <GarbageQueenEllie> DoomGuyXHatKid OTP
[1:47:35] <+BigBoy3535> Can we get Commander Keen in this game
[1:47:35] <+fritolayy25> There is a secret out here i think
[1:47:36] <%joylent_blue> Jack8274 because he wants to
[1:47:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Arthritis
[1:47:44] <sjcodan> Pat-lygon
[1:47:46] <%MagickBurritoh> Because he's insane
[1:47:47] <blackbookalpha> smug kiddo with vengeful demon slayer
[1:47:47] <eco419> this is a controller best play :)
[1:47:50] <%HentaiSenpai9K> Heathen
[1:47:54] <%brave_sj> Because he's a fake gamer Kappa
[1:47:55] <+future_famous_person> elevator
[1:47:55] <%spiritofmojave> it's because he's lazy
[1:47:55] <shotgunspaghetti> pat im pretty sure he missed a yellow keycard door but it might be too late
[1:47:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> Heretic
[1:48:03] <+YabbaTroll> that fucked with me too
[1:48:05] <+BigBoy3535> Him and John Halo should ride a dinosaur
[1:48:08] <bleugh> baby needs auto aim
[1:48:09] <mastermidget23> @BigBoy3535 I shit you not, there's a skeleton with Commander Keen's helmet in a hidden spot.
[1:48:10] <+BigBoy3535> Because dinosaurs are cool
[1:48:13] <Buzzard42> him and john halo should go on an adventure
[1:48:14] <FalseEyeD> @sjcodan Maybe he can make it past the tutorial level.
[1:48:18] <$Sayie> Someday people will realise that M+KB is only for ultra porn, controllers are for pro gamers
[1:48:19] <eco419> pog
[1:48:20] <sjcodan> This man plays a fucking MMO on a controler. he's clearly gone mad
[1:48:21] <%ElenaManetta> Anyone play shooters with a Wii-mote? It's a fucking nightmare
[1:48:21] <%shurtal> as i've gotten older, i've found that unless i re-map shit on ctrl buttons, playing fps games makes my fucking pinky hurt like a motherfucker
[1:48:22] <Buzzard42> Pog
[1:48:25] <dybia> I went afk a bit ago when he was still playing hat in time, what prompted this?
[1:48:30] <+razielhex> Commander Keen, Dragonbourne, Turkey Puncher etc. etc.
[1:48:40] <%spiritofmojave> @elenamanetta RE4 on the wii was uh, something lol
[1:48:41] <romanticzomedy> @dybia hat in time broke so we switched to demon killin

[1:49:05] <Ion_Laser> Fistbump FTW
[1:49:09] <Tucker0603> he's the b st
[1:49:09] <%ElenaManetta> Is Doom Guy cooler than Master Chef

[1:49:27] <%weissguard> I'm a little surprised he did that.
[1:49:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> More games need to try and write less and show more

[1:49:33] <JoeStillLife> No
[1:49:34] <+future_famous_person> yes
[1:49:35] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY is like the great, great, great grandsom of Terror Billy or some shit.
[1:49:35] <FalseEyeD> DoomGuy x Samus produced Master Chef
[1:49:36] <eco419> moon2A

[1:53:26] <Ion_Laser> @DesertPenguin09 He switched over. He's playing on Hurt Me Plenty
[1:53:28] <Run44forrest> switched over after hat in time crashed

[1:54:16] <vanderbolt777> pat wishs he was snoop dawg
[1:54:17] <Run44forrest> elmos the one playing
[1:54:17] <Kristoffers> snoop dogg should have a fake gaming channel
[1:54:18] <SandaSimpson> dats right, cap em and shank em
[1:54:19] <Onillius> "Red is ded, Blue is in the Goo" Jesse Cox, Dead Space,
[1:54:19] <+Pookiedaexzile> Snoop can fake all he wants he too high to lets play
[1:54:19] <+razielhex> P-A-Double-Tizzle
[1:54:20] <%spiritofmojave> Snoop only fakes because he's high, Pat's high
[1:54:21] <+Can_Do_Kamel> Lol so much for a hat in time lol
[1:54:22] <SandaSimpson> snoop dizzle
[1:54:24] <nutimik> Wait, why is pat playing with a controller?
[1:54:26] <+senfood> haha gottem
[1:54:30] <%patriotrenegade> Pat is me??
[1:54:35] <bleugh> snoop dogg is actually playing the game, he's hiding behind the couch
[1:54:35] <eco419> LUL snoop on mixer *playing *madden
[1:54:36] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Snoop doesnt fake. He plays them with his Penis
[1:54:38] <sjcodan> @nutimik Because he is dumb
[1:54:38] <hntronium> Pat and Woolie always record when high
[1:54:42] <antthefool> God hitting things with that rifle is so satisfying
[1:54:44] <hntronium> They're always high
[1:54:54] <+VariantX7> oh look codexes and lore that the doom slayer gives zero fucks about
[1:54:54] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat plays with a controller so he doesn't shit his diapy and cum
[1:54:55] <+razielhex> Knock Knock! It's HELL.
[1:54:56] <hntronium> So they're always recording
[1:54:58] <sjcodan> Literally polygon right now, pat
[1:55:00] <+Pookiedaexzile> keyboard and mouse too smooth
[1:55:02] <Abecale> Hat in time more like Pat losing mind
[1:55:03] <hntronium> Pat is on the big drugs
[1:55:06] <nutimik> This game is like 10 times more fun with a mouse :(

[1:55:42] <mastermidget23> SO, most of the weapons in this are insanely satisfying. What weapon ISN'T satisfying though? I'd say the pulse rifle. Almost never used it, especially once I got THE PROBLEM SOLVER later on that used the same ammo.
[1:55:43] <+razielhex> SWEEP The LEG!

[1:56:12] <+razielhex> Pulse Rifle when you have the Infinite Ammo Run is amazing. You never have to stop firing and it just wrecks @mastermidget23
[1:56:21] <%ZombieMonkeyNG> Did he already play seal the deal?
[1:56:27] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat's Version of Doomguy is more Ash from Evil dead

[1:57:14] <buerdo> @angriestpat what was the discount code for the raycon deal?
[1:57:16] <mastermidget23> @razielhex I can believe that. It's totally a solid weapon, I just don't like something about the way it -feels-, but I can't really explain why.

[1:57:31] <+Grayhammatter> indeed you have
[1:57:32] <eco419> yes u miss 3
[1:57:32] <%patriotrenegade> You have
[1:57:33] <Jack8274> Try not to think about it lest you go mad
[1:57:34] <Ion_Laser> @BionicPulga hurt me plenty
[1:57:35] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I legit think you have to come back here later to get them all
[1:57:35] <+VektorTroika> No Pat, don't let the MIND DEMONS take control...
[1:57:39] <%Diabetic> @Rostichenburg Devil Trigger Remix with Nero's fuck you
[1:57:39] <%Maids4lyfe> you missed at least more than one

[1:57:41] <Dr_Mooose> I always miss the elite guards
[1:57:43] <EMP_SaltyMan> yeah bout 3
[1:57:44] <Jack8274> @VektorTroika MIND GOBLINS!
[1:57:45] <+Greywyn00> look at that one you just missed walked right past it Kappa
[1:57:46] <deviljhojho94> @joylent_blue @romanticzomedy The struggle is real
[1:57:48] <hypecactuar> goblins
[1:57:48] <conflict1914> did you find the pulse rifle in this level
[1:57:56] <eco419> now just 2
[1:57:59] <%Maids4lyfe> no he did not
[1:58:06] <%Maids4lyfe> or he did
[1:58:07] <+razielhex> Pulse ammo tends to be hard to fiund and it burns through its shots really fast. The latency on it means you often have 5-6 more shots when they get into Glory Kill mode and it melts them befor eyou can get into cover. It's Pulse Burst is somewhat good.
[1:58:07] <+Darren716> No you didnt
[1:58:10] <+seoultrain> I still haven't beaten this game

[1:58:36] <SomersaultJustice> One toot on this whistle will take you to a far away place!
[1:58:40] <+razielhex> So having infinite pulse ammo as long as your armor is up just lets you hold that trigger down and treat it like a tracer.

[2:00:10] <sjcodan> @AngriestPat Opinions on Square enix's "Ethics Department"
[2:00:12] <+razielhex> Even better, Darin de Paul also voices JJ Jameson on Spider-Man
[2:00:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Doom guy is so bored with the plot, he's tuning out the exposition for the viewer

[2:00:38] <mastermidget23> @razielhex Wow, dude's got some range.
[2:00:39] <%Zamorouskiwhich> Subtitles were broken? ruuMad
[2:00:43] <42nfl19> This guys sounds suuuuper evil...I WONDER IF HE IS EVIL?
[2:00:43] <%patriotrenegade> Samuel Hayden did nothing wrong
[2:00:49] <%spinalwizard> @Kristoffers Basically everything but half his brain
[2:00:56] <+VektorTroika> the MIND GOBLINS are infesting the game
[2:00:56] <CybertronPrime> They gave Tifa abs, I'd say that's a fair trade.
[2:00:59] <+razielhex> And Emperor Valkorion in SWTOR
[2:01:01] <antthefool> He gives me Weyland vibes
[2:01:04] <EMP_SaltyMan> can't wait to punch Samuel in the sequel
[2:01:09] <Run44forrest> Pat you would do THE SAME
[2:01:15] <eco419> he is wasting our time moon2A
[2:01:17] <%patriotrenegade> HE DID NOTHING WRONG
[2:01:17] <%Maids4lyfe> Hayden also removed the part of his brain that controlled empathy and morality
[2:01:28] <Kristoffers> hahah
[2:01:28] <hypecactuar> PogChamp
[2:01:32] <Kristoffers> that explains things
[2:01:37] <%DesertPenguin09> Are you gonna go after all the elite guards?
[2:01:46] <Run44forrest> Didnt you say you wanted your brain in a robot body because then it would be clean
[2:01:51] <zamzoph> Hayden does what he must for humanity BibleThump 7
[2:01:56] <antthefool> Wait what @desertpenguin09 ?
[2:01:57] <conflict1914> you should invest in that upgrade that tells you where stuff is
[2:02:01] <sjcodan> @CybertronPrime She really doesnt have much in the way of abs in the remake, sadly
[2:02:06] <mastermidget23> Look, Samuel Hayden may be entirely responsible for this whole mess, intentional or not, but i gotta say if someone gave me the option, I'd become a 9 foot tall robotman given the chance.
[2:02:16] <eco419> look map :)
[2:02:18] <antthefool> ELITE GUARDS?!
[2:02:18] <+Darren716> Know what would make this game better? Some good, ethical, surprise mechanics
[2:02:21] <%patriotrenegade> Pat is smart
[2:02:23] <+Pookiedaexzile> What if Doomguy doesn't talk because he has stage fright
[2:02:27] <zamzoph> @sjcodan more than 0 abs
[2:02:28] <%Diabetic> @mastermidget23 I can't fault him but it's really Olivia's fault
[2:02:28] <%DesertPenguin09> Yes invest in the thing that helps locate secrets and go hunting for an hour or two
[2:02:30] <%spinalwizard> @mastermidget23 On this we can all agree
[2:02:31] <Run44forrest> yeah hes shy
[2:02:32] <Rostichenburg> I thought he was going to say he was gonna try and put his brain in a robot body
[2:02:42] <EMP_SaltyMan> he's like Gordon freeman
[2:02:42] <sjcodan> @zamzoph Like, 0.2 abs, tops.
[2:02:52] <TranquilTurnip> I really like the map in this game
[2:02:54] <%Maids4lyfe> Doom Guy doesn't talk because he can't speak english and doesn't know what anyone is saying to him
[2:02:59] <%DesertPenguin09> Map can get confusing sometimes, especially in later levels
[2:03:05] <%DesertPenguin09> But yea it's cool
[2:03:06] <sjcodan> I'd say toned, but I wouldnt call it "Abs"
[2:03:07] <eco419> follow the light
[2:03:12] <Run44forrest> map gave me metroid prime map headaches
[2:03:15] <mastermidget23> @Diabetic Agreed. Ultimately I don't hate Hayden, he's an interesting character because he does genuinely think it's the only way.
[2:03:19] <CybertronPrime> Doomguy isn't even human. Inside that suit is pure violence.
[2:03:19] <conflict1914> i thought he was backtracking but no he got lost in a straight corridor
[2:03:24] <Rostichenburg> Doom guy is just upset the demons killed his sister Billie
[2:03:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Just kill demons and don't say anything upsetting"
[2:03:32] <Monkeyweed21> @AngriestPat Why are you woolie right now
[2:03:33] <%Maids4lyfe> omg LUL
[2:03:34] <FirewallStorm> git that good shit
[2:03:36] <+calvinf10> Hey chat how many times has he fallen to his death so far?
[2:03:39] <zamzoph> ALL THE SECRETS [mind goblins]
[2:03:42] <EMP_SaltyMan> atpCap
[2:03:43] <GarbageQueenEllie> Just how much smaller bobs are we talking here? Tifa's at LEAST a DD.
[2:03:43] <eco419> yeyeye completionist mode activated
[2:03:48] <%DesertPenguin09> I like in Doom Eternal he makes noise when taking damage and you saw his face through the visor. That felt good
[2:03:48] <sjcodan> BIG LOST
[2:03:50] <Ion_Laser> When you kill Doomguy's rabbit. You have to pay the price
[2:03:51] <mastermidget23> Some say Doomguy is just ash inside scorched armor, from his exposure to the lighting of the first flame.
[2:03:58] <%Diabetic> So the only mobs we're missing via this game is the Archvile correct?
[2:03:58] <%spinalwizard> Everything gives you upgrade points, m'dude
[2:04:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Just kill the demons Doom guy, Don't say anything stupid"
[2:04:05] <%DesertPenguin09> Doom Souls
[2:04:05] <%king_wragles> @sjcodan he's back tracking for upgrades
[2:04:11] <%spiritofmojave> Chest shits are a thing you should probably get checked out

[2:29:21] <+Pookiedaexzile> @godzookylives No Doom guy is a shy Guy
[2:29:25] <Moonlight_Grimoire> that side alcove has upgrade pat
[2:29:25] <sjcodan> Thats the joke
[2:29:28] <%pajamarammaslamma> Pat never reloads either

[2:29:34] <romanticzomedy> doomguy always hustlin
[2:29:34] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat DO ROADIE RUN
[2:29:35] <+saltyputblug> Doom Guy is sprint
[2:29:37] <Moonlight_Grimoire> yee
[2:29:40] <%Gogogolem> doom guy runs with murderous intent
[2:29:41] <%king_wragles> I think double jump is this level acutally
[2:29:44] <GypsySquid> Oh, roger.
[2:29:44] <Moonlight_Grimoire> pat remembering stuff
[2:29:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy doesn't sprint, He is dawn to the kill by Rage Force
[2:29:52] <Ion_Laser> Doomguy sprints 24/7/365
[2:29:52] <+Grayhammatter> what...
[2:29:54] <sjcodan> whew
[2:29:56] <Moonlight_Grimoire> double jump is next level
[2:29:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Are you singing Megalovania
[2:30:01] <+Bob_Tom> double jump is a good chunk of game away
[2:30:07] <GypsySquid> Saaaame
[2:30:08] <+Bob_Tom> wait
[2:30:08] <pillowwasp> Imagine Doomguy in smash only being able to sprint
[2:30:11] <+paladinstarbuster> E1M1
[2:30:19] <conflict1914> >Doomguy rips off Pits wings
[2:30:20] <SixthSun2> He might get in MK11
[2:30:21] <romanticzomedy> totally thought you said you wanna smash doomguy, which is fair
[2:30:23] <eco419> double jump in two morelvls
[2:30:23] <+StrawberryPantsu> Doesn't afraid of anything
[2:30:26] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat you're supposed to say "can you give me a hand"
[2:30:27] <+Bob_Tom> DMC for smash please sakurai
[2:30:28] <$vincerocmm> cammander keens in smash
[2:30:34] <+razielhex> DoomGuy is too violent for Smash. I can see NRS taking that and letting him stay gory
[2:30:35] <%king_wragles> I love the assault rifle
[2:30:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> Don't do that Click Noise, I just watched Heredity
[2:30:37] <+Grayhammatter> can i.... get a hand?
[2:30:38] <Onillius> @lewdskeletor13 no the OG 93' Doom theme
[2:30:46] <benjiFG> check under the desk
[2:30:46] <%danpc5> Anime comander Keen in Smash just to spite Pat
[2:30:48] <Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> now imagine doomguy as fallout 76 DLC. Hah.
[2:30:49] <@lewdskeletor13> I know I’m just being sassy
[2:30:53] <+paladinstarbuster> LUL
[2:30:54] <godzookylives> I would rather have him in Smash to be honest even if MK makes more sense
[2:30:59] <Dr_Mooose> big demon ball right there
[2:31:03] <pillowwasp> Doomguy can convey violence through animation without gore chat. It’s completely pissible
[2:31:05] <%tigerfang86> goo zone
[2:31:09] <pillowwasp> Possible
[2:31:10] <+Grayhammatter> insanely gooet
[2:31:12] <%pajamarammaslamma> I just want someone violent for smash. Like Dante or Scorpion someone who kills things hard. Minecraft steve sounds like the worst choice now that banjo is in
[2:31:13] <zamzoph> SourPls
[2:31:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Also Rip and Tear, turns into Punch and spare

[2:32:07] <+Bob_Tom> god mick gordon is ggreat
[2:32:09] <GypsySquid> I think Smash makes more sense than MK, since blowing people away decisively is Doom Guy's thing.
[2:32:10] <Hispanacomida25> I love you Mick Gordon
[2:32:16] <pillowwasp> My dream is for Dante and Doomguy to be revealed in the same cinematic trailer fighting each other
[2:32:23] <Jolnir> oh gooood for youuu. and how was it?

[2:32:44] <eco419> missed armor
[2:32:47] <+Grayhammatter> big missed some
[2:32:52] <%pajamarammaslamma> I've never found Bayo super gruesome since attacks don't have much momentum and angels just kind of blood explode when you torture them
[2:32:56] <%tigerfang86> hmmmm
[2:33:05] <%NovaKnightmare> just dont bother
[2:33:14] <%pajamarammaslamma> like the craziness of Bayo takes away a lot of impact imo

[2:33:41] <%tigerfang86> the GOBBOLINS figured it out
[2:33:43] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> @pillowwasp That raises a terrifying question: Assuming that Doom Guy is extra effective against Demons, does Dante count as one enough to trigger the Rip and Tear instincts?
[2:33:44] <sjcodan> YES
[2:33:45] <+Jimboq> yes
[2:33:46] <%0dokuro> yes

[2:36:43] <Rostichenburg> Good thing Doomguy isn't in Smash then
[2:36:43] <%pajamarammaslamma> He would be friends with like Simon murder Bayo and Jokester
[2:36:44] <+future_famous_person> same
[2:36:44] <%segbas2004> is mike gordon doing the music for doom eternal as well?
[2:36:46] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat What's significant about Aether and Primal?
[2:36:51] <%NovaKnightmare> why you kicking urself?
[2:36:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @pajamarammaslamma I don't even imagine Mario and Luigi are friends

[2:37:05] <sjcodan> @zamzoph Means shits fucking full, my dude
[2:37:06] <+StrawberryPantsu> I wish Doomguy would pull off sick wrestling moves

[2:37:35] <%MyDarkStorm> @zamzoph Its ff14 datacenters in the NA
[2:37:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> bayo is a witch, she's pretty much a demon by DOOM standards
[2:37:56] <eco419> ssecret close
[2:37:57] <%pajamarammaslamma> Doomguy murder Bayo and Arsen
[2:37:58] <+Grayhammatter> god, it's so crunchy, i love it
[2:37:59] <+Eclipse_knight_> weakBalls
[2:38:00] <sjcodan> @zamzoph Ather and Primal are datacenters, not just servers
[2:38:00] <Run44forrest> rip and tear bayo? thats hot
[2:38:01] <%0dokuro> gonna be a lot of rule 34 of that if you know what I mean
[2:38:07] <%segbas2004> I see there NL subs in chat
[2:38:12] <romanticzomedy> @segbas2004 he did an interview on vgr about a year ago that talks about it.
[2:38:16] <sjcodan> @zamzoph Essentially 2/3 of NA is full
[2:38:18] <+YabbaTroll> lionDoubtit
[2:38:19] <DraxTD> Are you having fun playing the Son /grandson/decendent of Comander Keen @AngriestPat ?
[2:38:29] <Rostichenburg> I think Doomguy would probably hate the Bayonetta angels much more
[2:38:34] <%MasterDecoder> Demon Bayo secret boss in Doom Eternal? Probably not, but it'd be neat
[2:38:38] <%pajamarammaslamma> Commander Keen grew up and fucked
[2:38:50] <sjcodan> ?
[2:38:53] <+Grayhammatter> that would be dumb
[2:38:53] <sjcodan> ???
[2:38:55] <%0dokuro> Stronger
[2:38:55] <+TheSaintJohn> this kills the game
[2:38:55] <+ArcLifth> thats fucking stupid

[2:39:02] <Ion_Laser> @pajamarammaslamma And had kids for a Non-Mobile game Kappa
[2:39:02] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RagingMath) (warning)
[2:39:02] <%arancet> thats an insane stance for a company to take
[2:39:03] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat Goblin server is still open Kappa
[2:39:05] <%Nobrev> what does that even mean pat
[2:39:06] <%ElenaManetta> ot EXACT OPPOSITE
[2:39:06] <+OmegaFatalis> the melee button also being the interact button is the best thing ever. Doom Guy just wants to punch the world
[2:39:07] <Dr_Mooose> so no one can play then
[2:39:07] <%castarts> Wierd Flex but ok
[2:39:08] <%Shadicara> No pat the server is going to explode and you're gonna take it like a man LUL
[2:39:09] <42nfl19> Why would any company be like "We don't want your money"
[2:39:09] <pillowwasp> How long would it take for Doomguy to figure out Dante was a good demon
[2:39:11] <Tucker0603> the fuck Pat did you say?!?
[2:39:13] <sjcodan> Bad flew, not ok
[2:39:15] <eco419> missed a rocket launcher
[2:39:20] <+SWindleFeD> might as well get the armor pat
[2:39:22] <+Pookiedaexzile> Restrict access for profit?
[2:39:24] <%meltdown547> Pat "I couldn't play Warframe for years because Excalibur Prime was unobtainable" Boiven, wants to lock a game?
[2:39:27] <%pajamarammaslamma> Doomguy and DMC3 lady are very similar characters
[2:39:28] <+StrawberryPantsu> But @AngriestPat Patch 8.2 for WoW is coming out F-Final Fantasy XIV is d-dead
[2:39:33] <+saltyputblug> yeah
[2:39:34] <Run44forrest> my brain filters mmorpg talk out i cant help it
[2:39:35] <$El_Desperad0> no
[2:39:35] <eco419> s there
[2:39:38] <+Pookiedaexzile> No
[2:39:41] <%0dokuro> no
[2:39:41] <TranquilTurnip> @AngriestPat How is FF14 for someone who doesn't really play MMOs?
[2:39:41] <%castarts> ammo
[2:39:44] <blacksheeprising> Yes you did/
[2:39:45] <Moonlight_Grimoire> I think there is an early rocket launcher?
[2:39:46] <%ElenaManetta> SLiGHTY WHAT
[2:39:46] <Run44forrest> the lid pat
[2:39:49] <%brave_sj> It was on top of the lid
[2:39:49] <%rumtumtugnutz> ffxiv will continue to launch servers as they need to.
[2:39:50] <LivingLegacyVII> So you just cant get into ffxiv now?
[2:39:53] <zamzoph> at least we can still go to the data center with Balmung Kreygasm Kappa
[2:39:59] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dante Vs DOOMGUY go
[2:40:10] <AbysmalWulf> LUL
[2:40:12] <+razielhex> DOOMGUY
[2:40:13] <%arancet> yes, but then you add servers, not block customers
[2:40:13] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:40:18] <Run44forrest> dante is prertty op
[2:40:21] <%weissguard> Royal Guard
[2:40:21] <Sydin18> Rauban Ultimate incoming
[2:40:21] <sjcodan> THERE's ONLY 4 OPEN SERVERS LEFT
[2:40:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> but these servers will only be full for probably a few weeks after Shadowbringers launches
[2:40:31] <pillowwasp> They fight each other than fight an argent infused
[2:40:31] <jeffishype> Dante isn't demons so doomguy wouldn't fight him
[2:40:33] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dante is Demon Doomguy kill demon
[2:40:34] <%superc37> dante would win for sure
[2:40:34] <pillowwasp> Virgil
[2:40:35] <%pajamarammaslamma> Dante can shrug off most DMC weapons so I don't know if Doomguy is winning
[2:40:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> Soooo
[2:40:37] <eco419> uwu
[2:40:40] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Eh, everything's in the cloud now. It's Amazon's responsibility to deal with massive MMORPGs.
[2:40:44] <%ElenaManetta> Why not just open more servers
[2:40:45] <%0dokuro> Featuring Danta, from the Devil May Cry series
[2:40:48] <%MyDarkStorm> Yes
[2:40:50] <FirewallStorm> yes
[2:40:50] <dickbuttwoman> The big problem is that the servers modern MMOs use are all custom built and take MONTHs to come in
[2:40:52] <+saltyputblug> yes
[2:40:53] <%ElenaManetta> They would be making enough money to afford it if hitting max capacity
[2:40:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> buy a VPN so you can play in Jap as n.
[2:40:53] <%Shadicara> EU will be fine Kappa
[2:40:55] <eco419> yup
[2:40:58] <Moonlight_Grimoire> you did
[2:40:58] <sjcodan> Diabolos, Malboro, Correl and Goblin are all thats left, holy fucking shit
[2:41:01] <%pajamarammaslamma> I will raise my first-born child in the cloud

[2:41:14] <+ForteBlade> To be honest it would be shitty to sell a game that you couldn't actually play
[2:41:17] <xGeneralDOOM> yes
[2:41:18] <Ion_Laser> Well Shit...
[2:41:18] <%0dokuro> fight the crate
[2:41:18] <%joylent_blue> whats doomguy gonna do, shoot him? dante can take a bullet to brain twice and be right as rain
[2:41:23] <Moonlight_Grimoire> there is a gravity lift where you dropped down at, pat
[2:41:23] <marvel877> this is why this is my least favorite level.
[2:41:23] <anAngryHamster> Dig up stupid

[2:41:39] <zamzoph> It helps when there's no humans to look at
[2:41:42] <3xgilly> even on switch
[2:41:42] <InugamiTheHound> looks at good as doom 3
[2:41:42] <eco419> bye fockets

[2:42:20] <chronoxgp> musta been the demo then
[2:42:21] <%pajamarammaslamma> My PC stutters on Rage 1 and Wolfenstein TNO but Doom runs buttery smooth. Idtech 6 is good
[2:42:22] <%senorpapel> senorpapel subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! Hey pat just wanted to say thanks for killing wow so I could finally discover ff14. Best crafting system I’ve seen in a while.

[2:43:11] <deviljhojho94> Skyrim first came out on 1994, and it was originally called the elder scrolls
[2:43:13] <%debugdrawray_> thalo blue

[2:43:15] <3xgilly> ememe ememenies
[2:43:21] <+iforgottousername> Imjust glad Skyrim is finally comfortable enough to express his sexuality
[2:43:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> Skyrim existed before the earth did
[2:43:26] <Mechanical_Mayhem> No joke there's a secret that you need to jump into the lava for, a collectable
[2:43:29] <FoxOperator> skyrim isn't out on my stadia yet

[2:44:04] <+Pookiedaexzile> @Saltmeisterr Rip and Tear
[2:44:06] <eco419> yeyeye
[2:44:06] <%ElenaManetta> Hat in Time bugs pissing off Pat but Doom being relaxing and chill stream reminds me of that video game test "Violence in games doesn't make you aggressive. Bullshit and bad controls do"
[2:44:07] <%weissguard> It's ADORABLE
[2:44:13] <Asuxley> fallout doomguy
[2:44:17] <+iforgottousername> Don't feel bad pat, a lot of things in doom2016 are hard to find. Even the path forwards
[2:44:21] <FoxOperator> vault marine
[2:44:25] <+OmegaFatalis> Doom Guy is an otaku
[2:44:27] <Saltmeisterr> why doom of all games?
[2:44:27] <TheDr0t> DOOT76
[2:44:27] <romanticzomedy> i like the idea of doomguy attaching these dolls to his suit's shoulders like little parrots
[2:44:28] <Dr_Mooose> big boi
[2:44:30] <CybertronPrime> Hell Knight!

[2:44:43] <3xgilly> what if there was a F76 doom guy in eternal
[2:44:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat i found a way to play the cutscene for you pat
[2:44:45] <FoxOperator> doom guy is a bridge between otaku and frat guy
[2:44:48] <godzookylives> I'm glad they brought back the Doom 3 Hell Knight
[2:44:48] <%pajamarammaslamma> This game came out 6 months after Fallout 4
[2:44:50] <+SimplyPandaz> Is pat ever gonna keep a schedule right?
[2:45:00] <romanticzomedy> that's unpossible
[2:45:03] <FoxOperator> hah no
[2:45:13] <Saltmeisterr> @Pookiedaexzile ok but did pat never beat doom?
[2:45:15] <eco419> this game has a fallout 4 funko

[2:45:48] <%ElenaManetta> you really did get smoked

[2:45:55] <Moonlight_Grimoire> bridge to your left, lever on it for secret mission, iirc
[2:45:55] <+Dman1500> There is a lever on one of the bridges over the lava pool in this central room. Near the middle, behind a big metal box @AngriestPat
[2:45:56] <InugamiTheHound> yeah fallout 4 is a good game but 4 bad same endings and bad rip off of mass effect conversation. made fallout 4 feel kinda shitty compared to fallout 3 and new vegas
[2:45:57] <Saltmeisterr> @AngriestPat why you playing doom again?
[2:45:58] <@lewdskeletor13> I mean it was supposed to be Bloodstained tonight tho... Kappa
[2:46:04] <eco419> The lever is in the middle of the level crossing the otherside

[2:48:37] <mesamus> do not drop!
[2:48:40] <FoxOperator> what
[2:48:46] <FoxOperator> he looks super fast
[2:48:53] <Saltmeisterr> its like he's moving through molasses
[2:48:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> @Saltmeisterr What are you smoking
[2:48:57] <FoxOperator> or at least more dynamic
[2:49:00] <eco419> moon2VERYSCARED
[2:49:02] <+Agentoracle> thought this was hat in time?
[2:49:03] <romanticzomedy> he movin through demon soup
[2:49:07] <+Dman1500> I think he looks slower in eternal because the areas are bigger
[2:49:10] <Warbot40> He looks just as fast in eternal.
[2:49:10] <%brave_sj> How fucking heavy is that lever that Doomguy, who pries open blast doors, struggles that much to pull it
[2:49:12] <FoxOperator> I don't care if he's slower he'll be more mobile
[2:49:12] <Saltmeisterr> i mean his base movement speed
[2:49:13] <Ion_Laser> YE YE YE
[2:49:20] <Run44forrest> havent seen terminator 2 whaaaaat
[2:49:21] <Dr_Mooose> shit just got meta
[2:49:23] <pillowwasp> The areas were mite open in the eternal demo so it looks slower.
[2:49:26] <%king_wragles> Ya, the way he literally air dashes, double jumps, and grapples towards enemies is super slow. In other news, racecars are now considered slow
[2:49:28] <Ion_Laser> E1M2 Music YE YE YE

[2:50:59] <+Agentoracle> aww
[2:51:01] <FoxOperator> the movement options are great so I'm hopeful that I'll complete eternal quicker
[2:51:02] <SixthSun2> You have to play the full map in Extras to get stuff like that
[2:51:04] <mesamus> wasn't the rocket in that?
[2:51:15] <+AllenDeadman> this sections always look so fucking weird
[2:51:17] <%king_wragles> In the old one I think?

[2:53:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm being 100 percent serious wit hthis question
[2:53:20] <Rostichenburg> It seems like the Doom Eternal levels are going to be less varied if it's open world and not discrete levels now
[2:53:21] <%nobunagaesq> RICHARD
[2:53:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy Vs Akuma
[2:53:26] <%brave_sj> Sam Hayden's all like "We were only doing this for the energy, totally didn't want the demons involved" but his whole goddamn company is literally a cult
[2:53:28] <FoxOperator> 2016 had a lot of hallways leading to two layers
[2:53:35] <Coystick> !uptime
[2:53:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 53m.
[2:53:36] <nihaomiaou> I liked charged burst better but went for grenades first as well
[2:53:37] <SixthSun2> Fire is hot
[2:53:37] <eco419> honk
[2:53:37] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@FoxOperator) (warning)
[2:53:37] <MrTickleTrunk> ap?
[2:53:41] <MrTickleTrunk> *map?

[2:53:56] <Zereaux> i wish dying light was faster
[2:53:58] <@lewdskeletor13> Doomguy is cool and all but he isn’t THE President of these United States @angriestpat
[2:54:00] <eco419> Woo
[2:54:02] <InugamiTheHound> pat is spitting on hot fire like Dylan
[2:54:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Dylon
[2:54:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Gotta believe in your own Justice

[2:54:19] <FoxOperator> Doom Election
[2:54:26] <sjcodan> Goblin down, Zalera up
[2:54:38] <Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Just started FF14. Do quests ever show up in area's after you clear them out of quests? I'm super anal about missing quests
[2:54:55] <eco419> oof
[2:55:09] <Saltmeisterr> i hope more of the levels are less cramped
[2:55:10] <InugamiTheHound> LOL
[2:55:26] <FoxOperator> i hope more of the levels have less invisible walls
[2:55:29] <Run44forrest> the hell levels are less cramped
[2:55:33] <FoxOperator> yes
[2:55:34] <godzookylives> Even the laws of physics are scared of the Doom Slayer
[2:55:34] <Coystick> Dat Mick thumping
[2:55:36] <eco419> moon2EZ
[2:55:38] <FoxOperator> the second half is great
[2:55:51] <$RubberFistFight> @Coystick DOOF DOOF DOOF intensifies
[2:55:53] <%brave_sj> @Futurecity10 You can always scan over an area with your map periodically. Quests show up on the map once you visit the area
[2:55:56] <FoxOperator> doom skater needs more space
[2:56:01] <InugamiTheHound> wall is doom guy
[2:56:03] <Futurecity10> Thanks
[2:56:08] <eco419> dig up
[2:56:25] <eco419> where u find funko
[2:56:28] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I think it's a wall vent... I don't remember clearly though
[2:56:37] <+Pookiedaexzile> Woo
[2:56:54] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat my guess is you don't have the upgrade yet that makes your controller rumble slightly when you're near a secret
[2:57:03] <eco419> got it
[2:57:08] <Saltmeisterr> aaaye
[2:57:09] <Coystick> USB of POWER
[2:57:12] <FoxOperator> it's like that dmc reboot shit
[2:57:14] <nihaomiaou> secrets are so satisfying in this
[2:57:22] <FoxOperator> where dante started beebing
[2:57:25] <%ElenaManetta> Where would Chell and Gordon Freeman rank in the chart of Doom Guy. Above or below.
[2:57:28] <%king_wragles> This is a fun game
[2:57:32] <%king_wragles> ID did great
[2:57:33] <+MrWrann> So does FF14 ever stick with a single story arc past Heavensward, because so far it seems they switch arcs every like 6 quests
[2:57:35] <+mgskomododragon> no mouse and keyboard?
[2:57:37] <Ion_Laser> @ElenaManetta Below
[2:57:37] <+Aesopska> Pat stares at good video game
[2:57:38] <+Jaimie_Praufax> Pat, you gotta get the powerup mushroom
[2:57:40] <eco419> i love this :)
[2:57:45] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat what about the reactor thingy?
[2:57:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> Here that Pa-pas Ungrateful ass
[2:57:51] <Saltmeisterr> oh fuck he is playing with controller
[2:57:52] <$Jmann1892> @ElenaManetta Def Below
[2:57:52] <+iforgottousername> If you ever try to make out doomguys face behind the visor he looks a LOT like Guts
[2:57:56] <blacksheeprising> I love this game so much.
[2:57:59] <SixthSun2> Fuck you Jessica
[2:58:03] <FoxOperator> honestly the controller feels fine
[2:58:08] <Coystick> Man I made a mistake getting the triple shot upgrade for the shotty first
[2:58:13] <FoxOperator> like it better for moving precisely
[2:58:18] <Saltmeisterr> yeah it looks arlright tbh
[2:58:21] <eco419> last one moon21 moon2POGGYWOGGY
[2:58:24] <Moonlight_Grimoire> god I love how the music just builds
[2:58:30] <+Pookiedaexzile> Pat is offically a Crip
[2:58:31] <%king_wragles> @Coystick get gets good eventually... but it takes so long to get to that point
[2:58:32] <FoxOperator> yeah the triple shot is useless early game
[2:58:33] <Run44forrest> wym triple shot is better
[2:58:35] <%king_wragles> I think you need to max it too
[2:58:39] <+Pookiedaexzile> Him and Blueface will be doing songs together
[2:58:40] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[2:58:44] <FoxOperator> tho' it does wonders against tanky enemies
[2:58:45] <@lewdskeletor13> Jessica is dead man
[2:58:47] <InugamiTheHound> is the pistol on this game so bad?
[2:58:56] <FoxOperator> end game triple shot is better
[2:59:04] <Coystick> @king_wragles they even made the long range alt fire standard in Rage 2
[2:59:05] <+Jaimie_Praufax> Yo Pat, you should play some brutal doom. This game's just a ripoff of that.
[2:59:10] <FoxOperator> also the pistol doesn't really suck
[2:59:10] <+saltyputblug> rocket launcher is in this mission @AngriestPat
[2:59:11] <%ElenaManetta> Remember that era in your life where you thought getting good at Quake Live would impress your gamer friends? Oh, just me? ok.
[2:59:18] <FoxOperator> it's just underwhelming
[2:59:21] <GypsySquid> jfc one at a time, intercom douchebags
[2:59:21] <sjcodan> ???
[2:59:22] <Saltmeisterr> man i can't wait to hear the death metal opera
[2:59:23] <Moonlight_Grimoire> pistol is bad without upgrades, then it is decent. Pistol deals with zombies nicely though.
[2:59:35] <%king_wragles> Ya the pistol isn't as bad as you'd think
[2:59:37] <$RubberFistFight> Remember: the road to Hell is paved with Argent Energy.
[2:59:39] <+SWindleFeD> BLUE! doodCrazy
[2:59:40] <eco419> last time to get secrets or finish lvl
[2:59:43] <FoxOperator> and metal
[2:59:43] <3xgilly> accidental dismemberment
[2:59:49] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 3 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 12oz (360mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[2:59:51] <+Pookiedaexzile> I'm a little younger , So I thought getting good at Gears of War 2 would make me a MLG leet gamer
[2:59:53] <%king_wragles> it really shines when you max it, but it's a decent gun all around
[2:59:55] <eco419> down the secret lever
[3:00:06] <Coystick> Foundry is such a good level
[3:00:06] <FoxOperator> pat drink that water bag
[3:00:16] <3xgilly> booty cheeks steve
[3:00:16] <FoxOperator> foundry is great
[3:00:21] <FoxOperator> very open-ended
[3:00:26] <$Jmann1892> What exactly is minimal acceptable Demonic levels?? No bleeding walls and less than 3 possessed people walking around?
[3:00:29] <Coystick> Jump into the lava Paaaaat
[3:00:36] <+Pookiedaexzile> Who wins Doom Guy or the Predator
[3:00:40] <+saltyputblug> rocket launcher my guy. im not lying @AngriestPat

[3:01:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy or Gandalf of wins
[3:01:06] <Run44forrest> doomguy tells you GG before he rips your intestines out

[3:01:45] <42nfl19> When do we get the iconic double barrel?
[3:01:46] <%king_wragles> I don't know if I got it on my first time at this level. I know I 100% my first run but I might've found it by back tracking
[3:01:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> DoomGuy Vs Guts Who wins
[3:01:49] <Hydrapissed> no
[3:01:50] <+saltyputblug> no

[3:04:41] <%MightyMaxT> BAHOU
[3:04:47] <pillowwasp> Doom is the demons we meat along the way
[3:04:48] <InugamiTheHound> rocket launcher!
[3:04:48] <%Aeriz_> Pat I just started playing XIV cuz of you, 7 hours in and I'm on this shit hard
[3:04:48] <iamnolionheart> How can this be
[3:04:48] <FoxOperator> no friends just energy drinks
[3:04:49] <eco419> moon2EZ i did it
[3:04:49] <%weissguard> @SpcOpsBear Get well soon dude.
[3:04:53] <Moonlight_Grimoire> you are going to get all the guns early, this is going to be hilarious
[3:04:53] <CSeriesJTYPE> does pat do SLI or does he just have a single titan x
[3:05:01] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat it's at the end iirc
[3:05:07] <Saltmeisterr> time for some gibbing
[3:05:08] <+SWindleFeD> Why would they have a rocket launcher in a place like this?
[3:05:09] <%SpcOpsBear> @weissguard thanks
[3:05:12] <SixthSun2> I saw a white icon down below?
[3:05:14] <dickbuttwoman> What's that white thing on the outskirts of the map
[3:05:18] <+DownPlayTwitch> I like how in the new doom there are going to be new hidden secret demon fights. Each level has a demon meter that you can clear out if you find them all
[3:05:21] <FoxOperator> bcuz it's a metal as shit place @SWindleFeD
[3:05:23] <%hawk_rush> hawk_rush subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 9 months! yo
[3:05:29] <+nekodelic> @angriestpat white icon down below the map
[3:05:34] <Coystick> Why no weapon in the middle mode?
[3:05:41] <Luvinsus> White icon is armor chat
[3:05:48] <ape_hawk> wait, why is he playing doom and not hat in tim?
[3:05:56] <FoxOperator> I'm happy they didn't add dual wielding
[3:06:00] <Coystick> DOOF time
[3:06:02] <eco419> LUL LUL
[3:06:03] <pillowwasp> Hat tim doesn’t rip and tear
[3:06:04] <SixthSun2> This is hat in time, what are you talking about? Kappa
[3:06:09] <%MasterDecoder> @ape_hawk Newest update broke Nyakuza cutscenes
[3:06:10] <%IMDRanged> Looks like that RE4 area
[3:06:12] <FoxOperator> glad id stopped merging a bunch of shit together
[3:06:13] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Is Pat DOOMing good?
[3:06:14] <Floofiie> pon mods
[3:06:22] <ape_hawk> no, hat in time has more gore
[3:06:24] <%SpcOpsBear> Is... is the audio supposed to sound way too spatial?
[3:06:24] <SuiZideD> WHIFF'D
[3:06:24] <+Pookiedaexzile> Doom guy is a Gib slut
[3:06:28] <Run44forrest> nice
[3:06:28] <Saltmeisterr> NICE
[3:06:32] <%Aeriz_> I think they justify the rocket launcher for mining purpoes
[3:06:32] <FoxOperator> a hat in time was banned in india
[3:06:35] <%Aeriz_> *purposes
[3:06:36] <eco419> CoolCat
[3:06:41] <Coystick> They should put an endless wave mode in Doom Eternal and call it Doof Eternal
[3:06:50] <FoxOperator> Doom Palace
[3:06:54] <%Solidnick18> all these diomons
[3:06:57] <+SWindleFeD> @FoxOperator but why?...
[3:06:58] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat Is rocket jumping viable in Doom 2016? I forget
[3:06:59] <FoxOperator> Tartarus Eternal
[3:07:00] <SixthSun2> LUL
[3:07:00] <+DownPlayTwitch> Does Hatkid disapprove of pooping on train tracks?
[3:07:11] <%MasterDecoder> @Coystick And it has the mode exclusive BFG-inator
[3:07:18] <eco419> look up
[3:07:19] <FoxOperator> @SWindleFeD u gotta mine with certainty
[3:07:30] <%Aeriz_> This game is probably a nightmare to play with controller
[3:07:35] <+SWindleFeD> @FoxOperator no I mean hatty time being banned in India
[3:07:37] <nihaomiaou> what difficulty is he playing on
[3:07:47] <InugamiTheHound> I wonder how often in western and japanese games do we go to hell or heave and kill satan or god?
[3:08:11] <FoxOperator> @SWindleFeD oh it`s a dumb meme, it`s bcuz india brasil and other countries have some dumb rules about video games
[3:08:19] <eco419> this game is the friendliest for controllers tbh
[3:08:22] <%Solidnick18> yeah micro missles
[3:08:23] <%brave_sj> @Aeriz_ It is, look at how bad Pat is at the video game. Like 15% of that is his controller
[3:08:25] <FoxOperator> yes it`s smooth
[3:08:29] <Saltmeisterr> i feel like western games learn more into killing satan
[3:08:30] <%SWFanatic> This is a neat enter the gungeon mod
[3:08:30] <Lurantis_> Almost always hell, not sure if any game has you killing the abrahamic god @inugamithehound
[3:08:34] <Coystick> sex missiles
[3:08:35] <FoxOperator> jump with LB you guys
[3:08:44] <Saltmeisterr> and Japanese games more into killing god
[3:08:45] <+Manjove> Asura's Wrath tho
[3:08:57] <%Aeriz_> But then again, I wouldn't play a twitch shooter like Doom or Quake with a controller. Definitely M+KB kinda games for me.
[3:08:58] <pillowwasp> Doesn’t hell stuff get blocked in China
[3:09:02] <Zereaux> asuras not a human though
[3:09:07] <eco419> missing an usb
[3:09:07] <+iforgottousername> now that all those hot demon balls have been gotten rid of
[3:09:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @Lurantis_ SMT2 ends with you killing YHVH himself
[3:09:10] <%VioletHeart> I don't know what you're talking about. Game plays and feels great on a controller.
[3:09:17] <+soundcloud_raptor> this episode of chernobyl is a bit different than usual
[3:09:17] <InugamiTheHound> yeah in Japanese games we kill a god-like being, God or buddha
[3:09:18] <%ECRead> oh hey Wukong got a rework and he looks... kinda viable now???
[3:09:18] <FoxOperator> you can safely strafe on controller
[3:09:19] <eco419> thx randy
[3:09:21] <+Jaimie_Praufax> does anyone else here have an ossification fetish?
[3:09:23] <%Aeriz_> I believe it, I just haven't tried it.
[3:09:24] <Lurantis_> @valentinius_anodyne what’s SMT 2 stand for?
[3:09:25] <+d00msdaydan> why do people call this game doom 2016 and not d44m
[3:09:26] <%IMDRanged> Crotch SD card
[3:09:27] <mesamus> CoolCat
[3:09:29] <FoxOperator> enemies have very console friendly move patterns
[3:09:29] <+Grayhammatter> big maps, for big cowards
[3:09:33] <Coystick> @eco419 fark
[3:09:35] <pillowwasp> Not enough graphite
[3:09:35] <RAH001> AngriestDoom
[3:09:41] <%LucentNeodracht> @Lurantis_ Shin Megami Tensei 2 and 4 Apocalypse you kill YHWH
[3:09:44] <Zereaux> hey gonna finish on stream??
[3:09:46] <Moonlight_Grimoire> woo, level done
[3:09:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> THERE IS NO GRAPHITE
[3:09:50] <Saltmeisterr> i wonder how god switch pro controller would be for doom
[3:09:52] <SixthSun2> Oh hi

[3:09:53] <FoxOperator> tilda swinton time

[3:10:37] <Lurantis_> What’s the over under on Angels being a new enemy type for Doom Eternal?

[3:12:04] <ShichiNoBushi> What if the cat is just an obnoxious bastard?

[3:12:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Medo3G then get a sphynx
[3:12:07] <@lewdskeletor13> Can I buy an Elmo clone?
[3:12:07] <+TypicalAnomaly> "the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles"
[3:12:08] <nihaomiaou> cats are children that live on the floor
[3:12:09] <FoxOperator> ye getting a pet so u won't pet it is dumb
[3:12:09] <eco419> moon2EZ
[3:12:10] <+SWindleFeD> @RubberFistFight sometimes if you put a dot instead of a space between words twitch thinks it's a link
[3:12:11] <+nekodelic> he also gives you toxoplasmosis
[3:12:12] <CeeDee__> they come in hairless, thankfully
[3:12:13] <%brave_sj> Or Moobot whatever
[3:12:13] <%ElenaManetta> But YOU have allergies
[3:12:14] <MrTickleTrunk> Careful of Toxoplasma :S
[3:12:14] <InugamiTheHound> elmo scratches pat like goose did to nick fury in captain marvel

[3:12:17] <eco419> yeeeeeeeaaaaa
[3:12:18] <DeebzNutz100> AngriestCat
[3:12:20] <+Eclipse_knight_> pets are actually good for allergies
[3:12:20] <+StrawberryPantsu> Or was that the Brain parasite speaking?
[3:12:21] <FoxOperator> like not spending time with your kids
[3:12:21] <%MasterDecoder> Depends on how bad the allergies are
[3:12:21] <$RubberFistFight> @Lurantis_ a link warning. Also LOL @ the idea of a spoiler warning on a 3 year old game.
[3:12:33] <Saltmeisterr> man there needs to be more good single player shooters
[3:12:38] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> On the one hand, they might poop in the airport, on the other hand, doggos are fluffy
[3:12:41] <Coystick> Revenant time oh boy
[3:12:43] <Lurantis_> @rubberfistfight You’d be amazed how many streamers will ban spoilers on 10+ year old games
[3:12:45] <pillowwasp> I wonder if Doomguy kills the demons?
[3:12:47] <%Maids4lyfe> avoiding contact with pets can cause you to be allergic
[3:12:53] <Lurantis_> If it’s their first playthrough
[3:12:53] <eco419> ppl still get mad at FF7 Spoilers
[3:12:53] <sleepyskeletonzzz> everyone needs some sort of pet
[3:12:54] <FoxOperator> I prefer tactical shooters but they don't exist anymore
[3:12:55] <%ElenaManetta> Pat is such a confusing man. His reputation states he is both angry and has allergies yet he is chill playing Doom and petting his cat
[3:12:56] <Saltmeisterr> time for doot skeleton
[3:12:57] <Coystick> Prepare your bones
[3:12:58] <%ElenaManetta> what a fraud
[3:12:59] <MrTickleTrunk> I wonder if Pat and Peach HAVE "Toxo"; it would explain a lot Kappa
[3:13:00] <FoxOperator> so here it goes doom
[3:13:01] <%Maids4lyfe> but if your allergy is very mild, you can build a resistance
[3:13:03] <%king_wragles> HEY CHAT, Pat has played this before. He can't be spoiled on this
[3:13:05] <%SWFanatic> apatHoldon
[3:13:05] <+Dman1500> @RubberFistFight If you miss a period and the first word of a next sentence moobot detects it as a link, because you have words(dot)words.

[3:17:28] <Coystick> Hellwalker best main menu theme of all time
[3:17:39] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound milk in bags definitely exists, i've seen pictures of it.
[3:17:57] <InugamiTheHound> @chiluzza I wish they sell milks in glass bottles because that would be cool
[3:18:00] <eco419> fuck youtube guides thx game
[3:18:02] <Ion_Laser> The buddy system :D
[3:18:06] <$RubberFistFight> @Lurantis_ plenty of independent farmers and smaller companies do it here in Australia. Milk in glass bottles is great.

[3:18:07] <%chiluzza> @Lurantis_ If you live near a Dairy Farm they do, or literally any grocery store worth their salt

[3:19:17] <$RubberFistFight> @Lurantis_ that sucks man. Good milk is so damn good. You can still get the non-homogenised stuff that has the cream on top here. It's so good.
[3:19:18] <eco419> anything not on ultra = baby mode

[3:20:54] <%MightyMaxT> My favorite part of Dead Space 3 was making the Plasma Cutter XL. Line Gun plus rotater mechanism
[3:20:54] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat will always get the succ.
[3:20:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> @lurantis_ lots of people
[3:21:01] <Ion_Laser> Time for THE SUCC
[3:21:04] <eco419> best rune for me is executioner
[3:21:11] <supersunbro1> I remember working with a friend like 10 years ago to make a Doom RPG. It wasn't great, but I was proud anyway.
[3:21:24] <%Maids4lyfe> the pistol is decent
[3:21:27] <eco419> is free
[3:21:28] <pillowwasp> How long would it take Doomguy to solve the Halo alien problem
[3:21:36] <InugamiTheHound> pistol only speed run?
[3:21:37] <Saltmeisterr> bottomless missiles is the shit
[3:21:38] <eco419> one day
[3:21:42] <Coystick> Has there even been a good laser pistol in video games?
[3:21:43] <Ion_Laser> @pillowwasp 5 minutes
[3:21:45] <dekkitout> He'd just punch it @pillowwasp
[3:21:50] <Lurantis_> @rumtumtugnutz I live in the suburbs, never seen a glass milk bottle at a grocery store, might just be an american thing to not have them
[3:22:01] <Buzzard42> no
[3:22:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pillowwasp are the aliens demons? if not Doomguy doesn't care
[3:22:06] <+RiverKing13> Play on the hardest difficulty coward
[3:22:06] <%Maids4lyfe> america don't use glass bottles for milk either
[3:22:12] <eco419> moon2EZ
[3:22:18] <Moonlight_Grimoire> there is a lever behind you
[3:22:22] <%ElenaManetta> Come on kids! Say map's name three times
[3:22:25] <Lurantis_> @maids4lyfe I’m american too uwu
[3:22:26] <pillowwasp> @doc_ock_rokc they are essentially cultists
[3:22:33] <flying_man_3> There are plenty of glass bottle milks in america
[3:22:37] <dekkitout> I'm, now picturing Doomguy as Goblinslayer for demons LUL
[3:22:45] <hopecanon42> Kroger near me has glass milk
[3:22:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pillowwasp but they worship a giant BFG and not the mind eating demons
[3:22:47] <InugamiTheHound> @Maids4lyfe back in the day americans used glass bottles and then big corporations stoped using it and made us responsible for recycling the plastic
[3:22:49] <eco419> just a tease
[3:22:49] <$RubberFistFight> @Lurantis_ if you've got any smaller, family owned or independent stores, check them out. They might have some. But if you're in super-suburbia you might be shit out of luck. Rural/urban fringe is when you start to see them more in my experience.
[3:22:55] <Coystick> RIGHT THERE go back
[3:22:58] <Saltmeisterr> @dekkitout that's what he is tho
[3:23:05] <+KorysHere> i knew the map upgrade would just strengthen the goblins
[3:23:06] <+Eclipse_knight_> oberweis has glass milk
[3:23:09] <Moonlight_Grimoire> next to the two big blue lights
[3:23:11] <AdmiralButtloaf> this isnt hat girl
[3:23:15] <%brave_sj> There is a secret level lever in here
[3:23:16] <eco419> noooooo
[3:23:21] <Coystick> nooooo
[3:23:27] <Moonlight_Grimoire> in the corner
[3:23:27] <%Zamorouskiwhich> The lid!
[3:23:29] <Buzzard42> nooooo
[3:23:30] <eco419> keep moving
[3:23:30] <Saltmeisterr> this is hat girl with GUN
[3:23:32] <pillowwasp> @doc_ock_rokc Doomguy also occasionally goes out of his way to save people
[3:23:32] <Buzzard42> the lid
[3:23:34] <flying_man_3> you dont even need to go to small stores. Whole foods and safeway carry glass bottle milk
[3:23:37] <%MasterDecoder> @AdmiralButtloaf New Hat in Time update broke Cutscenes
[3:23:40] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound yeah, and now we're all being blamed for "recycling it wrong" even though 99 times out of 100 they just either ship it off to china, or combine it with the normal trash in landfills and don't tell anyone.
[3:23:51] <eco419> ikr
[3:23:57] <+Ell1ot> Purple
[3:23:59] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat below you
[3:23:59] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Yeah who the hell said blue?
[3:24:01] <Hoisengineer> they're purple
[3:24:02] <%Maids4lyfe> @dekkitout doom guy's voice actor is the same one who plays goblin slayer in the dub
[3:24:04] <%Solidnick18> idk
[3:24:05] <%LucentNeodracht> @RubberFistFight lol probably,
[3:24:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> The color of the lights are cool in a warm enviornment thus they seem blue
[3:24:06] <%chiluzza> we need to bring back superior glass for holding our liquids
[3:24:06] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat under the lever
[3:24:09] <+RootVeggie> they’re cyan
[3:24:14] <%Neryl_> TIL Pat can't see blue.
[3:24:15] <Coystick> That fine
[3:24:16] <%king_wragles> oh
[3:24:16] <eco419> back
[3:24:17] <jimmytwofeet> PATO-CHAN
[3:24:18] <AzirothTheGreat> The lid
[3:24:21] <%king_wragles> I was very wrong
[3:24:24] <Lurantis_> @rubberfistfight one day I will find the elusive milk
[3:24:25] <dekkitout> Now THAT'S some good casting
[3:24:36] <Moonlight_Grimoire> this room is super small
[3:24:39] <%MasterDecoder> @Neryl_ This has been known since that one Warframe Stream
[3:24:41] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight yeah china doesn't want out waste and Philippines wants to go to war with Canada(and win LOL) over trash and recycling
[3:24:46] <Coystick> The lights were clearly purple
[3:24:48] <eco419> no secret level uwu
[3:24:49] <flying_man_3> Glass is that great. it makes things way more expensive and it tends to burst if it gets too hot or cold
[3:24:50] <+RootVeggie> It’s so weird seeing classic Doom stages with high fps and motion blur
[3:24:55] <flying_man_3> *isnt
[3:25:00] <%chiluzza> glass is better than plastic
[3:25:07] <%chiluzza> it doesnt leech its plastic flavor into drinks
[3:25:10] <CybertronPrime> Does Pat know about the option to put the gun in the center of the screen?
[3:25:17] <%SpcOpsBear> aluminum is better than glass
[3:25:18] <Lurantis_> Soda in glass bottles is definitely a magnitude better than canned
[3:25:22] <eco419> EZ
[3:25:24] <Revant_tillywink> BIG AND STRONG
[3:25:27] <%Maids4lyfe> holy shit I just looked up to see what else Doom Slayer/Goblin Slayer has done and he was in fucking VR Troopers
[3:25:28] <%SpcOpsBear> it doesn't allow uv radiation contamination into your drink
[3:25:41] <pillowwasp> Lead bottles
[3:25:44] <%chiluzza> it doesnt react and the only time it shatters is when its dumb hot getting cold liquids pored into it
[3:25:47] <benjiFG> this bass unf
[3:25:48] <eco419> Coke in glass form is the best
[3:25:53] <$RubberFistFight> @chiluzza modern plastic bottles made of polypropylene don't do that. But to me the real advantage is that the milk stays colder for longer (and seems to get colder in general) in glass bottles.
[3:25:56] <+RootVeggie> yo DOOM VR is actually pretty fun

[3:26:35] <InugamiTheHound> does your progress save or do you have to re do all of it?
[3:26:36] <flying_man_3> monomer transfer will happen with any material and the taste dif for soda is usually because the kinds in glass are using dif sweeteners
[3:26:37] <%ElenaManetta> How come I don't hear Paige laughing at you rmisfortune
[3:26:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SpcOpsBear you make mr Snip Snips proud

[3:27:58] <%Maids4lyfe> OW
[3:27:58] <$RubberFistFight> @flying_man_3 if you pour a coke from a glass bottle into a cup, and pour a coke from a can into an identical cup, and taste them while wearing a blindfold, you won't be able to tell the difference. THAT "difference" is mostly psychological.
[3:28:11] <nihaomiaou> the burst shot is better imo
[3:28:17] <+AlwaysBeGaming> OOOOOO
[3:28:32] <%Guardiansaiyan> @AngriestPat are you beating the WHOLE game tonight?
[3:28:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight welll not entirely but the can one would have better carbination
[3:28:41] <Coystick> smrt gamer
[3:28:44] <flying_man_3> except that most of the ones in glass use cane sugar so they do actually taste dif it just has nothing to do with the bottle
[3:28:49] <%Maids4lyfe> you can't go there
[3:28:53] <InugamiTheHound> is Canada gonna ban single use plastic like the EU and UK??
[3:28:57] <eco419> Kappa awwww
[3:28:57] <+nekodelic> beginning of the level?
[3:29:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> ALSO Glass bottle cokes have Sugar Cane

[3:29:20] <ShadeNightz> LUL
[3:29:20] <@lewdskeletor13> beat the whole game coward
[3:29:22] <pillowwasp> Yeah glass bottle coke has a different recipe/bottling plant
[3:29:24] <$RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc funny story - the argument is usually that BOTTLES have better carbonation. Seems people can't make their mind up. Which is how differences due to psychological perception function, funnily enough.

[3:29:50] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat how you gonna kill a bunch of demons like a badass only to die to your lack of spacial awareness?
[3:29:52] <%Guardiansaiyan> says the time like this
[3:29:52] <pillowwasp> Kill demons
[3:30:02] <Lurantis_> Elmo is the true final boss
[3:30:09] <eco419> thx randy
[3:30:32] <%KrippSubBot> KrippSubBot subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat, what’s ur opinion of Doom 3? It got a lot of shit for being so different, but it’s still fun.
[3:30:36] <+PiZZAGUYTV> thaaaaanks
[3:30:43] <$RubberFistFight> coke from a drink fountain tastes different because the level of syrup vs fizzy water is not the same as in a can or bottle, and frequently differs from fountain to fountain, and even between trips to the same one.
[3:30:48] <%Faustgesicht> What happened to Hat in time?
[3:30:58] <pillowwasp> Hell happened
[3:30:59] <@lewdskeletor13> Hat in Time was borked
[3:30:59] <Lurantis_> Doom 3 was a good game, I just dont think it was a good Doom game
[3:31:02] <%brave_sj> @KrippSubBot It's not fun though. It's boring
[3:31:07] <+SkaiVibration> SourPls
[3:31:07] <%MasterDecoder> @Faustgesicht Newest update broke cutscenes
[3:31:18] <%Faustgesicht> Oh okay ouch
[3:31:29] <$RubberFistFight> @Lurantis_ agreed. Although it did have several aspects that were VERY true to Doom lore in general, and I liked the design of Hell.
[3:31:34] <%chiluzza> glass can also be recycled easier you can have a glass bottle that is made up ofhundreds of its lesser kin
[3:31:38] <flying_man_3> @RubberFistFight at least for soda dif types do have dif levels of carbonation usually due to being based on regional recipes. Dif countries like it dif. Mexican coke, aka the glass bottle kind, has cane sugar. Coke sold in africa tends to be less carbonated and mroe syrupy
[3:31:44] <lucin_gestalt> Hey Pat. Don't get hit and you won't die. It's that simple
[3:31:54] <Buzzard42> LUL
[3:32:01] <Buzzard42> NAILED IT
[3:32:07] <$RubberFistFight> @flying_man_3 being in a glass bottle doesn't automatically make it mexican. Here in Australia we've got it in cans, glass bottles and plastic bottles.
[3:32:15] <$RubberFistFight> all sweetened with cane sugar.
[3:32:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Faustgesicht don't worry I figured out how to replay a normally unreplayable cutscene
[3:32:30] <dekkitout> So does Doom do that thing DMC 5 does with the music in combat
[3:32:32] <%brave_sj> Nope
[3:32:37] <$RubberFistFight> Which, amusingly enough, is apparently DA WURSTEST the same way everyone freaks out about HFCS over there in the states.
[3:32:38] <Rostichenburg> No it's not
[3:32:41] <FirewallStorm> no its not
[3:32:49] <%Faustgesicht> Nice good jerb @doc_ock_rokc
[3:32:58] <Saltmeisterr> that would be dope tho
[3:33:05] <SaltyAzteca> SMASH
[3:33:06] <GypsySquid> "Yeah, no."
[3:33:08] <flying_man_3> in america 99% of the time you only get the glass bottles if they are based on the cane sugar recipe

[3:33:25] <Coystick> Yes. It. Is.
[3:33:26] <Lurantis_> It totally is tho
[3:33:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> But I disagree. It is necessary.
[3:33:27] <Buzzard42> "AH FUCK THIS"
[3:33:27] <flying_man_3> our regular coke uses corn syrup
[3:33:30] <CassidyAlacrity> How bout I do anyway?
[3:33:35] <@commanderclaw> The souls of the damned are an infinite power source!
[3:33:36] <InugamiTheHound> wow the chat is still talking about difference of coke from a can or bottle
[3:33:38] <%chiluzza> i would lover if all the sugar in the US was replaced with cane sugar i can have candy and not get lectured by the GF everytime i get candy
[3:33:39] <%Maids4lyfe> corn syrup sucks
[3:33:39] <$RubberFistFight> Fun fact: cane sugar is roughtly 50/50 split between glucose and fructose. HFCS is closer to 45/55. A whopping total of 5% more fructose. Even more fun fact: that alone is not going to hurt you AT ALL. Overconsumption is the problem.
[3:33:46] <%Jasek7> I could go for a Mexican coke rn
[3:33:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @king_wragles It might plus he might want to play it on his off time and if so I have the means to help

[3:34:31] <%king_wragles> @doc_ock_rokc I should have said guarantee instead of will , but those are still valid points
[3:34:36] <Lurantis_> Fountain soda is so good because they sprinkle cocaine in the machine

[3:34:54] <Coystick> double time stop
[3:35:00] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound at one point they were toying around with grinding it up and using it as a concrete filler/aggregate. Source: used to work for a big concrete company.
[3:35:14] <$RubberFistFight> I don't know why they stopped, maybe something to do with "omg microplastics" or summat.
[3:35:15] <GypsySquid> Clearly Hayden hasn't read Doom Guy's resume. He evicts Hell. Period.
[3:35:21] <%Solidnick18> huh
[3:35:30] <+biggysweet> bubble gun
[3:35:30] <%NWR_James> blue balls are never friendly
[3:35:35] <+Manjove> friendly balls
[3:35:36] <GypsySquid> It looks way closer to the original design in Eternal.

[3:35:52] <GundamF91> I never used the Plasma Gun, it doesnt feel satisfying at all

[3:36:14] <Lurantis_> @brave_sj I’m gonna fight you
[3:36:15] <Saltmeisterr> i kinda don't understand whats the difference between the plasma gun and the assault rifle
[3:36:16] <Coystick> it's supposed to be like a long ranged flamethrower
[3:36:16] <guppy_> plasma gun was my least used weapon
[3:36:19] <Ion_Laser> @LVDoomien Kappa
[3:36:24] <%king_wragles> @biggysweet why? When you get the armor rune ammo basically is unlimited
[3:36:25] <Saltmeisterr> aside from ammo
[3:36:26] <guppy_> especially since on PC shooting it slows down your mouse movement
[3:36:32] <%MightyMaxT> What if Doomguy was transported to ancient times to kill demons like Ash in Army of Darkness?
[3:36:55] <%enickma11> @MightyMaxT That movie would end in 5 minutes

[3:37:01] <$RubberFistFight> Doom64 was fucking awesome and is sorely underappreciated imho.
[3:37:04] <Lurantis_> Is there literally any situation in which you wouldn’t use the argent energy upgrades on ammo
[3:37:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> I like how he stopped for a second
[3:37:10] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat oh no you made Ultron mad

[3:37:56] <@lewdskeletor13> Doomguy wants to eat the rich

[3:38:46] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> missed one
[3:38:46] <+MisterCrimson> It occurs to me that the worst thing that could happen to Doom would be to give Jim Doomguy a voice.
[3:39:05] <%chiluzza> if they give doomguy a voice we need to riot
[3:39:07] <+Grayhammatter> not a single barrel down there my dude

[3:39:19] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert dunno why he'd have that problem, he's not stupid. And there's heavy implications that he's Doomguy from the original continuity, post-Doom64 and this is a separate timeline/universe.

[3:39:37] <%AncelDeLambert> @RubberFistFight the game gave me the impression he's a straight alien

[3:39:37] <sleepyskeletonzzz> super fantastic
[3:39:39] <Lurantis_> Which DOOM timeline is the doomguy a practicing catholic?

[3:39:55] <%king_wragles> @RubberFistFight isn't this a reboot though?

[3:40:05] <Coystick> @dekkitout Karl Urban
[3:40:06] <%MightyMaxT> Good luck @doc_ock_rokc I hope you rokc it
[3:40:14] <%chiluzza> gotta reboot the aliens ass
[3:40:15] <+JackMillerTime> @doc_ock_rokc sleep well doc
[3:40:17] <%king_wragles> @doc_ock_rokc Good luck!
[3:40:35] <+MisterCrimson> quick Pat, waste some ammo so you can pick up the objects in case you need them later
[3:40:37] <+Ploobie> Is anyone else worried about Doom Eternal being lackluster? The recent Wolfenstein and RAGE games were nothing amazing...
[3:40:51] <InugamiTheHound> apparently cyber punk 2077 is racist because of a gang called the animals had some black folks in it
[3:40:52] <ShadeNightz> I don't think it'll be.
[3:41:01] <$RubberFistFight> @king_wragles yes, but the hints are still there. At the end of Doom64 doomguy stays in hell and rampages across it - which is exactly what this guy's backstory is and why the demons locked him away. Additionally, "Hell" is explicitly stated to be extra-dimensional, so who's to say it's not connected to the original timeline as well?
[3:41:02] <Lurantis_> There’s like a 30% chance it will blow, but I really doubt it will
[3:41:06] <+DownPlayTwitch> Everyone came out of E3 high as fuck off Doom
[3:41:07] <%king_wragles> @Ploobie different teams
[3:41:07] <Coystick> Doomguy: Doom is not Eternal, I am Eternal.
[3:41:19] <+MisterCrimson> right?
[3:41:29] <$RubberFistFight> @king_wragles there's also artwork ingame, like tablets and carvings, as well as the presence of the soulcube from Doom 3, that would support that idea.
[3:41:33] <+Hotironclad> It's also doom
[3:41:33] <Ion_Laser> Reloading in Doom 3 got to be a pain in the ass
[3:41:35] <%spiritofmojave> Why would Doom Guy ever stop shooting
[3:41:37] <%Zamorouskiwhich> But the super Shotgun needs reloading ruuThink
[3:41:44] <Manwad> reloads ruin any modern day/sci-fi ARPG for me
[3:41:45] <%AstroFalcon09> yo am i late to the strim?
[3:41:51] <stabbityrabbit> I thought Doom Slayer's humanity was ambiguous? He definitely started human, but so much fuckery has happened in his life that he might not be anymore. Which is only made more questionable by the stunts he pulls. Am I mistaken?
[3:41:54] <+Grayhammatter> it's fine
[3:41:55] <godzookylives> YOU SAVED HIM
[3:41:55] <Coystick> @Zamorouskiwhich that's a cooldown :^)
[3:41:55] <InugamiTheHound> doom 3 you couldn't use a flash light and pistol at the same time
[3:41:56] <AzureHawk_Streams> MrDestructoid MrDestructoid MrDestructoid
[3:41:57] <Lurantis_> @astrofalcon09 like 3 hours
[3:41:58] <EddieBrock> I saw nothing.
[3:41:59] <+Aesopska> oh yes.
[3:42:01] <+fgcmorad> Ohh Bethesda
[3:42:02] <CybertronPrime> Fun Fact: the backstory of this game implies that every single .WAD someone has ever created or will create is canon to DOOM lore.
[3:42:02] <dekkitout> What part of "rip and tear until it is done" mentions reloading?
[3:42:02] <jaguarkek318> LUL
[3:42:04] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> masaka
[3:42:09] <+rusephine> Even the concrete is demons
[3:42:10] <+AlwaysBeGaming> doom is a perfect game
[3:42:10] <+MisterCrimson> it also occurs to me that Comander Keen is an asshole for naming both his kids Billy/Billie
[3:42:12] <%chiluzza> The only reason the Super Shotgun needs reloading is so that more targets will come
[3:42:13] <@lewdskeletor13> Yeah this is supposed to be the original Doomguy just transported to a different universe
[3:42:22] <@lewdskeletor13> From what I understand
[3:42:23] <+paladinstarbuster> Sexy Imp STUCK in ground gets pounded
[3:42:25] <%chiluzza> it lulls them into a false sense of security
[3:42:25] <%king_wragles> ID coded the game... Bethesda only published it
[3:42:28] <+Grayhammatter> it's not rip and reload and tear
[3:42:30] <+scrubz_413> Oh no
[3:42:33] <$RubberFistFight> @stabbityrabbit you're pretty much bang on. He's spent so much time going in and out of hell that he's changed now, but he definitely started as a baseline human.
[3:42:35] <Coystick> Time stop boots
[3:42:37] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat is peach the dead? NomNom
[3:42:42] <Lurantis_> When are we getting the DOOM Eternal battle royale?
[3:42:42] <AzureHawk_Streams> Popping in
[3:42:47] <+MisterCrimson> you'll have time to reload in Hell
[3:42:49] <+AllenAfro> you can get everything on this map without double jump

[3:43:36] <$RubberFistFight> @lewdskeletor13 I love how you can see the clear rage and irritation in the way he reacts to dialogue and stuff, like "jesus christ, no matter what universe i'm in, the UAC NEVER FUCKING LEARNS"
[3:43:37] <$rekinom> Yeah, give her the big hug, with your DIIIIIICK
[3:43:46] <InugamiTheHound> baba is wall was just too much for Paige

[3:44:38] <@lewdskeletor13> @brave_sj wiki says it’s the original Doomguy based on the description given in Quake Champions which says he’s the original one transported to this universe. All the hell lore happened after that allegedly

[3:46:18] <+fgcmorad> @torontototoro Maybe time it so it explodes behind shield dudes
[3:46:26] <pillowwasp> Friendly reminder that Pete Hines at bethesda told an interviewer that they spoke to Nintendo about smash dlc
[3:46:34] <%torontototoro> @SWindleFeD ah that makes sense. I only ever used rocket launcher on big dudes so never thought of that
[3:46:45] <TalisKanju> Yo Pat, how was Bloodstained yesterday?
[3:46:48] <%brave_sj> @lewdskeletor13 I always thought he was one of the knights from a different world the demons conquered, who helped the demons invade in exchange for his son's life, but they double crossed him and so he went on a killing spree and has continued ever since
[3:47:00] <Lurantis_> @pillowwasp who’s pete hines again?
[3:47:00] <+saltyputblug> he get doble barrel yet
[3:47:01] <+Aesopska> retro shred

[3:47:33] <%weissguard> Doomslay-san
[3:47:35] <$RubberFistFight> @kiiiirsten bethesda didn't make this, they just published it. iD software are still responmsible.
[3:47:41] <Limes528> @kiiiirsten Doom deserves it
[3:47:43] <Saltmeisterr> dude i hope we see doomguy's bunny
[3:47:45] <eco419> This was made by ID no bethesda dummy
[3:47:47] <Lurantis_> @pillowwasp oh. oh noooooooooo.
[3:47:49] <%spiritofmojave> I really like how Bethesda has pushed ID software into being the same entity, damn you Todd
[3:47:54] <Moonlight_Grimoire> Beth doesn't dev good games, they publish good games is how it works, imo
[3:47:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bethesda has lied their way through so much stuff that I doubt they even know what a Nintendo is.
[3:48:00] <%kiiiirsten> apatFist
[3:48:02] <Hispanacomida25> All the stuff not made by Bethesda is good
[3:48:02] <Coystick> hooot
[3:48:04] <+MisterCrimson> rip rockets, you might have needed those for later
[3:48:07] <+fgcmorad> Arkane studios are good too
[3:48:10] <+Aesopska> he almost got remote LUL
[3:48:16] <AzureHawk_Streams> Freedom dispenser
[3:48:35] <SuiZideD> oh noes
[3:48:35] <Ion_Laser> Bethesda is good at publishing. Trying to develop in-house is when things turn into a goddamn shit-show
[3:48:40] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[3:48:40] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 48m.
[3:48:40] <pillowwasp> Watch the smash dlc character be Dragonborn and everyone get pissed off
[3:48:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> Vault Boy is gonna be in Smash.
[3:48:48] <InugamiTheHound> remember Bethesda invented the FPS game and everyone loves fallout 76 and everyone is hyped for elder scrolls blades
[3:49:06] <Lurantis_> Here he is, Skyrim Dragonborn here to fight in Smash Bros!
[3:49:07] <+unclekulikov> Lockon deals less damage than regular rocket
[3:49:09] <thatd00doverthere> I figured pat would be bunny hopping way more in this game lol
[3:49:11] <californaya> Pat, how do you keep missing with a shotfun
[3:49:11] <Hispanacomida25> Vault just stares at you and demands money for a win
[3:49:17] <+MisterCrimson> GOOM
[3:49:19] <+unclekulikov> Gooigi?
[3:49:24] <%rumtumtugnutz> vault 76 will be the Smash fighter
[3:49:28] <Coystick> I suppose Remote Detonation could be uselfl if you miss a shot and can clip them with the explosion
[3:49:29] <%spiritofmojave> Gooigi~
[3:49:29] <InugamiTheHound> @pillowwasp a wiiUMii character dressed up like skyrim man
[3:49:30] <+unclekulikov> Doom Gooternal
[3:49:32] <Saltmeisterr> arbiter time
[3:49:37] <Goergorion> Pat is the type of person to kill you and then complain about it.
[3:49:42] <%mh9s> GOOm Guy
[3:49:52] <stabbityrabbit> @InugamiTheHound Which is why everyone is excited for the most iconic Bethesda character to come to Smash. The king from the start of Oblivion.
[3:49:56] <pillowwasp> But would it be Skyrim man or vault man
[3:49:57] <BappoSama> Is this a complete playthrough?
[3:50:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Brent from HR next smash fighter
[3:50:02] <DeebzNutz100> Jell-O doom pops
[3:50:02] <stabbityrabbit> Yes, the one that died immediately.
[3:50:03] <+MisterCrimson> "hero"
[3:50:05] <Lurantis_> I can’t wait to smash my controller in DOOM Eternal because they brought back pain elementals
[3:50:05] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> DOOM GUY is my hero
[3:50:06] <%MasterDecoder> @BappoSama No
[3:50:07] <%mh9s> so the biggest hero
[3:50:12] <%Ne1son> WoAh
[3:50:12] <GypsySquid> Doom guy's not a dick, though?
[3:50:13] <%torontototoro> Pat's already beaten this game before, right?
[3:50:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> well hes saving humanity so yeah hero
[3:50:14] <guppy_> all doomguy cares about is killing demons
[3:50:17] <+CaptainJax> doomguy is SUPER heroic
[3:50:17] <Coystick> Doom is Hero
[3:50:18] <pillowwasp> @stabbityrabbit yay Patrick Stewart finally
[3:50:18] <Halospaz117> He's a dick to demons
[3:50:18] <+fgcmorad> Doom guy is best husbando
[3:50:22] <Ion_Laser> @torontototoro yeah
[3:50:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Look at Billy "Doom Guy" Keen go.
[3:50:29] <dekkitout> Jean Luc Picard would make a great addition to Smash
[3:50:32] <InugamiTheHound> @stabbityrabbit its all about the jarl of whiteout that dude be balling! *jarl of skyrim does a windmill dance on the table*
[3:50:33] <%Ne1son> Doomguy is not a dick unless you are a demon, are you a demon @AngriestPat
[3:50:34] <nobody12349> Dick to those that deserve it
[3:50:35] <TheLakinessMonster> Doom guy is a nice guy. He's just sick of everyones shit
[3:50:35] <+MisterCrimson> SLAYER is DOOM
[3:50:36] <Saltmeisterr> wait no summoner dude?
[3:50:38] <%Nobrev> doom slayer is good to humans and a dick to demons
[3:50:42] <InugamiTheHound> white run sorry
[3:50:49] <Saltmeisterr> i thought he spawned there
[3:50:50] <GypsySquid> He cares a lot, y'know? He's just so done with this demon bullshit.
[3:50:52] <42nfl19> been in and out, did we get the double barrel yet?
[3:50:54] <$RubberFistFight> @Ne1son well I mean he's a ginger, so...
[3:51:06] <TheLakinessMonster> If you look at how he acts towards humans in the Eternal trailers he just walks around and has a good time around people.
[3:51:12] <Hispanacomida25> I just realized Daisy is in Eternal so Doom guy gets his rabbit back
[3:51:16] <%spiritofmojave> Doom Guy is probably a really wholesome friend
[3:51:21] <stabbityrabbit> @InugamiTheHound Are you implying that his taunt wouldn't be him flossing?
[3:51:41] <+MisterCrimson> Casual reminder that Doomguy is Commander Keen's son
[3:51:43] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[3:51:46] <eco419> woo
[3:51:47] <TheLakinessMonster> If anything happens to Daisy, there will be hell to pay.
[3:51:47] <pillowwasp> Doomguy doesn’t have friends. He is too busy killing demons
[3:51:49] <GypsySquid> Like, he gave Hell a chance to not invade, but they broke that promise and he had to become the consequences by locking himself in Hell to punish it for years.
[3:51:50] <SixthSun2> @MisterCrimson *Descendent
[3:51:56] <$RubberFistFight> @MisterCrimson or grandson*
[3:52:03] <BaslerJones> @MisterCrimson its the opposite
[3:52:06] <SixthSun2> It's unknown how many generations went between Keen and Doomguy

[3:54:30] <pillowwasp> No it’s a metaphor for clean coal
[3:54:31] <godzookylives> I hope Pat finds the Commander Keen secret
[3:54:31] <megaman_sentinel> OP
[3:54:48] <InugamiTheHound> @pillowwasp god i hate that term clean coal. Such lies
[3:54:49] <BappoSama> I love how it's called the SUPER SHOTGUN
[3:54:52] <dakuman13> i forgot doomguy is fucking commander keen godfuckingdamnit
[3:54:58] <Addyoxt> Which level is this?
[3:54:58] <42nfl19> But can you rocket jump?
[3:55:00] <$masneo2> would it be neat if doom guy and dante had a collab together?
[3:55:05] <+paladinstarbuster> I love the soundtrack to this game
[3:55:07] <%weissguard> Doomguy: Rip and Tear tho 4Head
[3:55:17] <+Manjove> next level
[3:55:18] <+braixhim> double jump is next level
[3:55:18] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound here in Australia, our PM took a chunk of coal that'd been coated in lacquer/varnish to parliament to prove how "clean" it was.
[3:55:23] <@commanderclaw> It's at the beginning of the bridge/tower level
[3:55:26] <pillowwasp> @dakuman13 only related
[3:55:27] <%Nobrev> next level for jump
[3:55:31] <Rostichenburg> It's not in this level
[3:55:32] <Saltmeisterr> doom guy doesn't rocket jump
[3:55:40] <$RubberFistFight> He had to coat it because IT WASN'T CLEAN. Not even to handle. Fucking chump.
[3:55:43] <%SwdVengeance> Next level for double
[3:55:43] <+HotBloodedHero> Replayability
[3:55:45] <+TheyTookMyBeard> @AngriestPat You can get everything here
[3:55:49] <%OmniSTylez> Hey pat. Hey chat
[3:55:50] <Buzzard42> nyet
[3:55:54] <InugamiTheHound> @RubberFistFight wow that's dumb and I thought american politicians were dumb and give out fake news
[3:55:56] <Buzzard42> everything is attainable as you first reach the level
[3:55:56] <Saltmeisterr> that's more of a quake thing
[3:56:03] <%yoshkosh20> DOOM SLAYER
[3:56:05] <dakuman13> @pillowwasp in current year that's still horrible
[3:56:09] <%Yadogari> Heat Blast is great
[3:56:12] <Buzzard42> stun bomb is a godsend too
[3:56:12] <%MasterDecoder> @RubberFistFight Damn that's bad, IQ tests and reality checks are needed for Politicians
[3:56:14] <$RubberFistFight> @InugamiTheHound his name's Scott Morrison if you wanted to look into him and his bullshit.
[3:56:15] <Limes528> Hell yeah
[3:56:19] <Buzzard42> both the plasma rifle upgrades slap, but heat blast is better
[3:56:26] <+braixhim> there's an achievement for getting all secrets on your first playthrough of a level
[3:56:37] <Moonlight_Grimoire> heat blast is a real nice passive damage increase
[3:56:45] <Limes528> heat blast is great because it doesn't cost ammo
[3:56:46] <pillowwasp> @dakuman13 true, but at least BJ’s genes are mire dominant
[3:56:47] <dakuman13> i really love the firearm designs in this game. super sleek and organically designed
[3:57:01] <%fattness132> Coming in late here - doom on a controller, pat. really?
[3:57:02] <+MisterCrimson> oh my god, I bought a bag of columbian cacao dark chocolate and it's soooooo bitter. I love it.
[3:57:07] <+Estuko> demon casually hanging out: monkaS
[3:57:12] <Buzzard42> @fattness132 it's comfy
[3:57:19] <$RubberFistFight> @dakuman13 I love how the super shotgun is just straight-up a double-barrelled shotgun. Like it's not a space shotgun or anything.
[3:57:31] <Jack8274> We all do
[3:57:37] <+SWindleFeD> ^
[3:57:40] <mesamus> everyone forgets about the grenades
[3:57:47] <dakuman13> @RubberFistFight this 100%
[3:57:47] <@commanderclaw> Yeah, nades are gonna be way better in Eternal with the shoulder launcher
[3:57:49] <+Manjove> dont need them
[3:57:52] <%Yadogari> Why use a grenade when you can just switch to the rocket lawnchair
[3:57:53] <$RubberFistFight> @fattness132 nothin wrong with that - I have it on PS4 and it plays beautifully on a controller.
[3:57:54] <+ZenVulgarity> I forgot there were nades in this game
[3:58:01] <nihaomiaou> I used them all the time
[3:58:04] <+photas10> is doom the series that was awaiting a sequel forever and then when it came out it was shit
[3:58:09] <pillowwasp> Exposed biceps
[3:58:17] <NeroInfinite> that was duke
[3:58:21] <+Estuko> @photas10 duke nukem*
[3:58:32] <$RubberFistFight> @photas10 nope. Doom, Doom 2, Doom 64, Doom 3 + the expansion, then this.
[3:58:41] <+iforgottousername> and it was never heard from again
[3:58:42] <mesamus> @photas10 there was a prototype that was dropped cause no one was gonna like it
[3:58:45] <+photas10> ahhh right right
[3:58:50] <$RubberFistFight> there was definitely a period there where nothing was happening though.
[3:58:50] <pillowwasp> I never played doom 64
[3:58:52] <dekkitout> Arctic Assault Doomguy. In stores now
[3:58:55] <NeroInfinite> Duke 3 was kinda pants IIRC wasn't it?
[3:59:01] <NeroInfinite> DOome*
[3:59:12] <Hispanacomida25> Duke 3 was buns
[3:59:17] <Ion_Laser> Doom 3 was ok
[3:59:18] <dakuman13> just seems like the artist had fun drawing up the concepts for these guns, making them stand out even with more uniform color palettes etc
[3:59:19] <Saltmeisterr> SOURPLS
[3:59:20] <XelGel> doom 3 music remix
[3:59:23] <$RagingMath> Does anyone who plays FFXIV know the fastest way to go about leveling up a fisher? I'm Lvl 40 at the moment and was curious

[3:59:35] <mesamus> oh shit! yeah its tweaker's song
[3:59:37] <filialpails> YOU HAVE HUGE GUTS
[3:59:40] <$RubberFistFight> @pillowwasp you should. It's part of the main story, not a port. There's various "total conversions" out there for Doom 2 that allow you to play it on PC, I'd suggest "The Absolution" as it's the most faithful.
[3:59:43] <eco419> GRIFFIITH
[3:59:51] <Stay_Hydrated_Bot> @angriestpat stayhyBottle You've been live for just over 4 hours. By this point in your broadcast you should have consumed at least 16oz (480mL) of water to maintain optimum hydration.
[3:59:53] <artoflec> god the way the music cuts in and out during that is so good
[3:59:53] <dakuman13> oh man its the kratos juice

[4:01:16] <$RubberFistFight> what the fuck did you wake him up for if you're just gonna try and stop him, Hayden? jesus christ.
[4:01:17] <%Hammerknife> oh he's playing it with a controller
[4:01:20] <%MightyMaxT> If they wanted to stay alive, they shouldn't have used demon energy
[4:01:20] <pillowwasp> Doomman don’t care bout energy
[4:01:21] <megaman_sentinel> he he really helpful lol
[4:01:22] <%LupaTheWolf> Millions dead, billions saved
[4:01:22] <$RagingMath> @AngriestPat Sorry to ask you a FFXIV related question, but would you happen to know the best way to level fisher at the moment? I'm Lvl 40
[4:01:24] <mesamus> oh yeah i remember in the OG DOOM video how they loved this scene cause the movement speaks a lot about doomguy
[4:01:29] <BigDaddyofCincinnati> I aspire to give no fucks about stuff as much as Doom Guy
[4:01:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Kill her pat
[4:01:34] <Jack8274> PERFECT
[4:01:36] <+ZenVulgarity> It's amazing how much personality DoomGuy has when he doesn't say one god damn word
[4:01:52] <Saltmeisterr> doom is fun
[4:01:53] <romanticzomedy> good strem
[4:01:54] <TurtlesAndTentacles> awwww
[4:01:54] <cham52> Killing demons is definitely a personality
[4:01:57] <romanticzomedy> naito
[4:01:58] <$RagingMath> Appreciate it, thank you so much @AngriestPat <3

[4:02:06] <lucin_gestalt> See ya Pat. Woo Judgement!!
[4:02:13] <$RubberFistFight> @ZenVulgarity the part in the opening cutscene where Hayden is waffling about how it was "all worth it" - and he just looks slowly down at the corpse in the lift, looks back up at the screen and then punches it as hard as he can.
[4:02:21] <%Niney_Who> You gonna die
[4:02:23] <%MightyMaxT> Screw Judgment, CTR is where it's at!
[4:02:25] <dakuman13> dude do whatever

[4:05:36] <%megabrogus> Did he read donations in the middle of doom I missed like an hour and hes way past were I donated
[4:06:00] <%Kirby_Sauce> Cheer500 watch some RT animated so you can grasp their in-jokes. Gotta grease those palms. Was doing the extreme quiet fight in MGSV. They patched her ai so she moves if you drop a crate on her, but you can trick her into staying still if you duck in and out of cover, forcing her to shoot at you. This makes the fastest way for me to beat this with all objectives is to groundhog in front of an enemy who can 1shot me. I'm glad this was my first mgs game.
[4:06:02] <%Kirby_Sauce> reward A Cheer shared Rewards to 10 others in Chat!
[4:06:05] <+MisterCrimson> @AngriestPat I wanted to let you know that I tried your cut twice technique on my milk and it spilled everywhere instead of pouring. You lied to me. Next time I'm pinching the jug.
[4:06:17] <+Grayhammatter> missed a whole everything

[4:07:31] <SomersaultJustice> can't wait for machinist to exist again
[4:07:35] <%AstroFalcon09> LUL
[4:07:40] <Moonlight_Grimoire> if I go back to FF14, I'm going to do Gunbreaker or Machinist

[4:08:42] <%Niney_Who> Just don't drop
[4:08:47] <%MasterDecoder> Set aside some time, Direct Deposit is literally the best
[4:09:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> The best way to serve and drink milk is to just not.
[4:09:21] <+MisterCrimson> reusable milk bottles are great, but it sucks that farmers keep shooting at me when I try to refill
[4:09:33] <%MegboyManuel> are we talking about milk bags again
[4:09:44] <Ion_Laser> yeah
[4:09:55] <%OmniSTylez> after watching hot ones i learned that drinking milk after eating 2,000,000 scoville sized peppers doesnt help much
[4:10:04] <%Kirby_Sauce> No i love it, it's so dumb
