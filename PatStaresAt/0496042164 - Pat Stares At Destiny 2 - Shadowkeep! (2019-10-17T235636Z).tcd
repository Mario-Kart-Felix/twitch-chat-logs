[0:08:17] <collinscorpio13> Thanks for the RPGTreeNua @spcopsbear
[0:08:18] <%RubberFistFight> Yeah they overdeveloped the RPG combat system and the rest of the game is kind of a desert.
[0:08:19] <tigerfang86> that's a big No Pat game
[0:08:20] <veldinmusic> I disagree but i can totally see why you would say that
[0:08:20] <+DrFacilier> no number go up gameplay? Trash.
[0:08:20] <Monkeyweed21> Thats wrong pat

[0:09:14] <%DraxTD> ah
[0:09:21] <%ElenaManetta> You have to love the town?
[0:09:22] <jorniev> it feels weird, like its lacking something
[0:09:26] <Skibopadoo> the pacing is really weird
[0:09:27] <%dumbnamettv> I can feel pat on this. Some downtime could really be used
[0:09:43] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> something something kill some rats
[0:09:47] <%ElenaManetta> "Once you left, monsters took over"
[0:09:48] <zamzoph> My town D:
[0:09:51] <%rainwater739> I think the pacing just feels off.

[0:10:20] <+chaumiester> Isn't that.... Standard RPG storyline?
[0:10:24] <+neodeltai> Go left. Go right. Town destroyed. Pacing achieved.
[0:10:25] <Aydarkzero> the game felt very fast
[0:10:25] <Psyramics> it can't be the hero's journey cause she is immediately "i wanna go on an adventure!"
[0:10:29] <%honeyman18> I CAN FEEL THE 2ND ENCORE COMING
[0:10:33] <Aydarkzero> like oh hey dad ded
[0:10:41] <zamzoph> But town was offscreen tho!
[0:10:50] <%dekkitout> You feel like you went in feet running?
[0:10:52] <Kisiel250> I took it as devs making a joke on the trope
[0:10:57] <%rainwater739> @AngriestPat So they didn't build up player commitment to the town before harming it?
[0:10:59] <Aydarkzero> Monday gonna be good Kappa
[0:10:59] <%ElenaManetta> "I don't want to race Riku to name my boat, just get me to Donald and Goofy"
[0:10:59] <%Feifong_wong> I feel the same, the pacing was way off and I really didn't like the combat
[0:11:00] <Monkeyweed21> The story pace slows down to a comfortable pace after Sumeru
[0:11:00] <valriot> @angriestpat It's fighting game players going "Just lemme lab"
[0:11:00] <zamzoph> LUL
[0:11:01] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> oof
[0:11:02] <$DigitalJoshie> So woolie
[0:11:04] <tigerfang86> I respect your opinion pat, very well voiced, but be prepared to FIGHT WOOLIE next week
[0:11:05] <%TendrilsTwitch> its jump starting the rpg formula but rpgs are about the story. if you skimp over the story, whats the point
[0:11:05] <reonome> because woolie HATES rpgs
[0:11:06] <%mh9s> because woolie is empty
[0:11:07] <%Yakobro> LUL
[0:11:09] <%tizz86> oof indeed
[0:11:10] <mrblack499> wow
[0:11:12] <tigerfang86> Pat LOVES menus
[0:11:14] <%cherubs_anonymous> Yeah Woolie's right
[0:11:17] <crazzmatazz2> why would you NOT want RPG menu time
[0:11:18] <Psyramics> there's no number to make go up
[0:11:19] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> no numbers to go up
[0:11:20] <%rainwater739> #menu_love
[0:11:20] <%Rngiddion> its not fluff! its the MEAT of rpgs!
[0:11:21] <zamzoph> Pat PLAYS FF14!
[0:11:22] <%cherubs_anonymous> Stop liking padding Pat
[0:11:24] <%Farples> Menus can be enjoyable
[0:11:24] <tigerfang86> NUMBERS GOOD
[0:11:24] <narusao> menutime is funtime
[0:11:26] <%tizz86> shots fired
[0:11:26] <crazzmatazz2> your RPG menu time should ALWAYS BE MORE than actualy gameplayyyyy
[0:11:27] <$D_day> Gimme a Persona menu aleksCheck
[0:11:27] <+crimsonharvest> its like the MacOS version of an RPG
[0:11:29] <spyder_casual> breaking news, angry ginger has opinion
[0:11:30] <+neodeltai> The characters feel shallow too.
[0:11:31] <tigerfang86> Menus and Numbers are COOL
[0:11:33] <%Farples> P5 menus for example are super fun
[0:11:36] <reonome> your combo goes up
[0:11:37] <jorniev> JUST MEAT IS NOT A BALANCED MEAL
[0:11:38] <%cvp5127> numbers go up Kreygasm
[0:11:38] <Monkeyweed21> Do you not like Indivisible because of A LACK OF MIND GOBLIN FOOD
[0:11:38] <%dekkitout> An rpg without any of the narrative connecting tissue
[0:11:39] <rubbishbinge> Try Valkyrie Profile?
[0:11:40] <narusao> whee! menus
[0:11:41] <mrblack499> @AngriestPat but nioh lol
[0:11:41] <%ChaosAethr> Its That the Point of An RPG?
[0:11:41] <Psyramics> there's no numbers to go up, there's no building to do
[0:11:49] <%SpcOpsBear> BUT HULK WANT BIG NUMBER
[0:11:51] <%Saltmeisterr> also those tutorials are BAD
[0:11:54] <kelvinxj> I wanted more Character depth
[0:11:58] <%ShockzNDrawe> pat dislikes the thing you like boo him
[0:11:59] <%Kiiper> maybe give it more of a chance off stream
[0:12:00] <Finaldragoon> @AngriestPat sounds like a solid Steam Sale game in a year or so
[0:12:00] <lotharrio> Indivisible is not actually an RPG, I agree.
[0:12:03] <%ElenaManetta> What IS an RPG
[0:12:07] <kelvinxj> and a movelist
[0:12:13] <%ElenaManetta> They aren't anymore?
[0:12:15] <narusao> are pee geez
[0:12:16] <%ElenaManetta> They still are
[0:12:17] <OhioNitsud> it's fun to look at numbers
[0:12:19] <%AgentOrangeShoes> Why is an RPG
[0:12:24] <%gekizenbu> game called indivisible, game leavespeople divided
[0:12:29] <tigerfang86> WHERE MY MOVES AT
[0:12:31] <+sleepy_coffee> It’s like a strategy but with stats and characters on a 2d plane
[0:12:32] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I mean in any game you're playing the role of someone. All games are RPGs Kappa
[0:12:33] <phrickshun> RPG is such a wonky-ass classification these days
[0:12:34] <Monkeyweed21> but they level up and get new moves
[0:12:37] <%Mendin> Neither did base release skullgirls Kappa
[0:12:37] <%ShockzNDrawe> that seems to be a trend with lab zero games
[0:12:39] <%cherubs_anonymous> Okay Dad
[0:12:39] <zamzoph> HWNDU
[0:12:42] <Kryss_arondight> WTF? WHY IS PAT PLAYING DESTINY?
[0:12:44] <narusao> god hand is an RPG
[0:12:44] <$DigitalJoshie> Again with no movelist
[0:12:48] <%ElenaManetta> Is Pokemon an RPG
[0:12:50] <%ShockzNDrawe> skullgis launched with out one
[0:12:52] <+Ryallen> It's surprisingly shallow in its design for a game designed by people who put out one of the better fighting games
[0:12:54] <%Rngiddion> yeah maybe you some Mike you fool
[0:12:56] <Bailey__gaming> @elenamanetta where is a rpg

[0:14:34] <Monkeyweed21> why aren't you playing Iceborne Pat
[0:14:35] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if you wanted a relatively short but rather awesome game to fill stream time, you might wanna check out Observer. It's a fair bit like SOMA at parts and contains themes I think you'll enjoy./
[0:14:36] <%ShockzNDrawe> get all the guns and armor pat
[0:14:37] <%Farples> It also crashed the game in PvP

[0:21:56] <%SpcOpsBear> PEPSI BLUE WAS THE SHIT

[0:22:18] <%Corporate_Redeemer> apatPorgmo apatPorgmo apatPorgmo
[0:22:20] <+razielhex> otherwise, you can probably get the original GAMER FUEL, an energy drink called BAWLS
[0:22:20] <+MoonObscure> LUL
[0:22:21] <marvel877> Blue colored Pepsi that tasted like someone mixed Blue jello into it, ruining two good things.
[0:22:21] <%dalmek> like a good boy
[0:22:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah thats cats
[0:22:23] <Virokwet> Elmo knew youd slept long enough
[0:22:27] <%mh9s> he good
[0:22:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Dementedpenguin same. I wish they'd bring crystal pepsi back that shit was amazing too. When I was a kid it was like "it looks like lemonade but tastes like pepsi, HOW CAN THIS BE?!"
[0:22:31] <%Doruben> woolie needs to calm down
[0:22:34] <@lewdskeletor13> He’s a good boy
[0:22:34] <%Dr00_PhD> sounds gross
[0:22:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> My old poodle would do the same but with a cry that she wants outside
[0:22:39] <%GarbageNirvana> I should get a cat alarm clock
[0:22:46] <shurtal> I had a cat that would fishhook me in the morning so he could lick my nose until i woke up
[0:22:48] <lyzegredjag> Yeah so good
[0:22:49] <%rainwater739> @RubberFistFight It's impossibles
[0:22:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> guru taste like ball stink

[0:23:14] <+MazDoThing> E M L O
[0:23:15] <@lewdskeletor13> Outer Wilds, that’s out next week Kappa
[0:23:17] <%Xooler67> he's dumb until pat trips over him
[0:23:22] <%Varlinator> Noooooooooo
[0:23:27] <%Shadicara> Liar Kappa
[0:23:29] <Dementedpenguin> I wasn't a fan of the crystal logo, though
[0:23:31] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat when you played it it was like Black Hole Simulator 2019. You just kept finding ways to trip into that thing.
[0:23:31] <zamzoph> Pat's friendship with Warframe is OVER D:
[0:23:33] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Whats That Shirt?
[0:23:34] <%dekkitout> Did you at least get the sick symbiote suit
[0:23:38] <%GarbageNirvana> I'll probably get back into Warframe when New War finally drops
[0:23:39] <frozenballz> This year has been a bit fbzS
[0:23:44] <%pilgrimsayswhat> All this talk about Indivisible actually relieves me a bit, less games I feel like I need to get on quickly
[0:23:46] <MasterDecoder> @dekkitout Probably not
[0:23:47] <%ChaosAethr> Looks cool
[0:23:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> Warframe is okay, I found some new fucking weird builds that are not meta but still strong
[0:23:49] <frozenballz> i feel they got a bit complacent with the updates.
[0:23:52] <%Varlinator> Still waiting for Empyrian :(
[0:23:55] <$oAlec687> "spoke"
[0:24:08] <AMajorTom> It the warframe lady got into Jojo, does that count for nothing?
[0:24:11] <Bailey__gaming> nothing feels as good as Destiny when it comes to shooting the gun
[0:24:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> hahaha u kno the Secret, Pat shhh
[0:24:18] <%Varlinator> apatBig Ambition... but slow-ass delivery
[0:24:21] <rubbishbinge> fair
[0:24:23] <Aydarkzero> oh...
[0:24:26] <vexicbayn> that's all incredibly fair
[0:24:27] <+razielhex> That's why I left WarFrame in like 2013
[0:24:28] <%BoboDaHobo> sup nerds, how y'all doing tonight?
[0:24:31] <Crankthulhu> "Warframe isn't dying" Kappa
[0:24:45] <%dekkitout> Power creep is a hell of a drug
[0:24:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I have faith in DE still, laugh at me if you will
[0:24:45] <Qwertoqwerto> When Warframe has no gear to grind for I bounce off like rubber
[0:24:46] <@lewdskeletor13> @bobodahobo Howdy
[0:24:46] <AbnormalEnd> Damage gating is the dumbest thing ever
[0:24:47] <MasterDecoder> @razielhex That's when it was worse than it currently is
[0:24:48] <%ryome> Wisp needs a bigger ass
[0:24:48] <shadytreeofknowledge> warframe dont die they break
[0:24:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> I just got a mirage build that nukes shit
[0:24:53] <%PinkSuprende> PinkSuprende subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 16 months! how is anthem still having events i can't even
[0:24:54] <zamzoph> Pat HATES Warframe!
[0:24:55] <%Varlinator> Fair enough
[0:25:00] <frozenballz> they're too ambitious and their scope is too big for the time they take to get the content out.
[0:25:02] <Monkeyweed21> What about Iceborne?
[0:25:02] <%BoboDaHobo> @lewdskeletor13 howdy
[0:25:08] <shadytreeofknowledge> boooo Space Hats lol

[0:25:12] <%terribleusername> number go up, unlike indivisible
[0:25:12] <%Rngiddion> one day?
[0:25:14] <+enternius> Honestly Destiny 2 just has such good gunplay, everything feels good to use
[0:25:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Still haven't found a good raid group, alas
[0:25:16] <+razielhex> Yeah but I got to like EAGLE rank by 2013 and had every weapon and frame to 30 and modded how I liked and the game was.. empty.
[0:25:18] <Thalchampz> HE DOES
[0:25:21] <Monkeyweed21> IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY
[0:25:24] <frozenballz> and now this year that ambition has grown a bit bigger than they can cover i guess.
[0:25:27] <Thalchampz> his XIV streams were on crazy times
[0:25:29] <zamzoph> What about Max?
[0:25:29] <%GarbageNirvana> None of you motherfuckers play on PS4 so
[0:25:31] <+razielhex> I was just doing dojo runs to better my time and... eh
[0:25:33] <MasterDecoder> @AngriestPat Plague is in Brozime's Discord
[0:25:34] <@StridentSong> YEA I WAS
[0:25:45] <Thalchampz> fuck yeah strident
[0:25:47] <%ShockzNDrawe> we were talking about digimon
[0:25:49] <%BoboDaHobo> We all have bad sleep, you're just the only one we can judge
[0:25:50] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat tripped on the one-armed bandit and now is passed out drunk with his own arm draped around the lever.
[0:25:51] <Dementedpenguin> I saw him fight through a final fantasy stream. It was maddening DansGame
[0:25:53] <Thalchampz> giving tips and not using them
[0:25:54] <%Corporate_Redeemer> Pat are you gonna stream some DBD once they release the Archives update?
[0:25:56] <%theo_marks> Sleep is for the week
[0:26:00] <shadytreeofknowledge> somebody say Digimon
[0:26:06] <shadytreeofknowledge> agumon

[0:27:28] <Sabbrewolf> full scumbag company.
[0:27:30] <%GarbageNirvana> Hard to find a large-scale gaming company out there that doesn't have some kind of stake in China tbh
[0:27:32] <%topendbuzz> "kinda" lol
[0:27:32] <Thalchampz> be aware chat
[0:27:35] <%dekkitout> If not even more given the shit from the walkouts back in may
[0:27:38] <+Darren716> At least Riot isn't fucking people over for their opinions like Blizzard
[0:27:39] <shadytreeofknowledge> im Aware

[0:28:19] <@lewdskeletor13> Butt
[0:28:20] <+razielhex> An authoritarian state that endorses a form of State-Capitalism and has a market of a billion people, capitalist entities in the west have no reason not to kowtow, as neoliberal policies are in no way going to regulate them.
[0:28:25] <%Shadicara> Butt punch
[0:28:32] <+Darren716> Like every company is attached to China, Blizzard are the idiots who decided to blatantly punish people for their political beliefs

[0:33:47] <%Feifong_wong> Feifong_wong subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Does Woolie like any roguelikes? Risk of rain 2 was updated recently with a punch girl that has a grappling hook, I know you bounced off of it but I think he could get into it with a character like that.

[0:34:09] <Thalchampz> amazing
[0:34:15] <Qwertoqwerto> @AngriestPat locally organized competitive matches in Destiny 1 were called "sweats" instead of friendlies
[0:34:15] <%MalekDracarus> Hardcore players in general are called sweaty
[0:34:20] <Swish19XX> Halo Bros

[0:34:56] <%dekkitout> Quote from my cousin Josh: "Ay cuz this shit got me hella sweaty"
[0:34:57] <Kalinflip> Woolie is very accessible lol
[0:34:57] <%MegboyManuel> okay thank you
[0:34:57] <$Timesteel> it's sweaty because you actually have to put in work due to the skill based match making in like all but one playlist
[0:35:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat it came from I believe Mr. Fruit and Jez originally
[0:35:05] <+razielhex> DREAMBONE CONNECTED TO THE..

[0:35:15] <%terribleusername> pit check
[0:35:19] <%dumbnamettv> Sweaty is a better term than tryhard
[0:35:23] <Tucker0603> mobility over recovery?
[0:35:27] <+Javaa01> Just know that Mobility doesn't apply when running
[0:35:32] <%SpcOpsBear> Pat being sweaty would make me sweaty
[0:35:34] <Kalinflip> @dumbnamettv Sweaty tryhard is my go to phrase
[0:35:35] <StripesUltimateEdition> the dreambane armor is heugh
[0:35:36] <@StridentSong> Sweaty is the best
[0:35:37] <%rainwater739> Pat like to go fast
[0:35:40] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Pat I dont Understand this games Menu system Plz help
[0:35:44] <%lucidrush> the colony isnt a sweaty weapon
[0:35:44] <%terribleusername> it's very descriptive terminology
[0:35:47] <@PeachSaliva> Pat loves to go fast.
[0:35:55] <%Shadicara> You'd think sweaty would be more insulting
[0:35:56] <zv1neda> @AngriestPat how's armor 2.0 now that your deeper into the game?
[0:35:57] <+sleepy_coffee> If you love your wizard so much why don’t you marry him sipsipDab
[0:36:02] <%topendbuzz> tell us more pagie
[0:36:06] <MarylandJutsu> If Elmo would be a Desinty charecter what Class would he be Pat?
[0:36:07] <%Dr00_PhD> hi paige
[0:36:09] <Kalinflip> Pat loves deez nuts Too :)
[0:36:12] <MarylandJutsu> In everything Paige?
[0:36:15] <@PeachSaliva> Howdy
[0:36:21] <ScreamLord> It's so weird seeing all these stats in D2
[0:36:21] <Sabbrewolf> Hey Peach.
[0:36:22] <Dementedpenguin> I just think of Schweddy balls whenever someone says that. :/
[0:36:22] <$Timesteel> for mobility you should use transversive steps
[0:36:23] <%legendfather_of_giants> It sucks in the levelling process, but way better at max
[0:36:26] <%GarbageNirvana> It's weird to me that anything you got before the update is still 1.0
[0:36:27] <Ion_Laser> KonCha
[0:36:30] <%President_Miyazaki> Armor 2.0 is just time consuming until you stop using it at all because you're set.
[0:36:35] <%Xooler67> I wild peachsaliva appeared
[0:36:35] <MarylandJutsu> We miss your sassy amazing ownings of Pat, Paige
[0:36:35] <+bobfriskit> I like 2.0 having more flexability at least
[0:36:37] <%Shadicara> Sup paige Kappa
[0:36:39] <%Xooler67> *a
[0:36:43] <%Ryallen> Is it cliche to ask if Destiny 2 is worth playing now of all times?
[0:36:44] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat what ship is that?
[0:36:44] <Sabbrewolf> @AngriestPat They are adding more options to 2.0 soon. They announced it in the TWAB today.
[0:36:45] <Monkeyweed21> @AngriestPat How are you enjoying Iceborne?

[0:37:10] <%GarbageNirvana> @PeachSaliva Don't worry, he can't buy hats in this one

[0:37:42] <xvalltendo> indivisible wasn't doing it for you eh @AngriestPat
[0:37:43] <%Jay_Squirrel> they are making it so you can have 2 of the same mod on an armor piece but they give diminishing returns @AngriestPat
[0:37:43] <+D00msDayDan> whaaaaaa
[0:37:46] <valriot> Good, it's fucking broke.
[0:37:46] <%dekkitout> Yeyeyeye

[0:37:54] <corepercentlives> outrageous
[0:37:56] <Aydarkzero> the axe monkaS
[0:37:56] <%President_Miyazaki> Crimson got big buffs.
[0:37:57] <%MadMatt2099> Seeing this game run at 60FPS on PC has made me uninterested in playing on console, to be completely honest
[0:37:58] <Sabbrewolf> @AngriestPat loosening of stacking restrictions on Armor 2.0 mods. Starting next season, the restrictions on having multiple mods of the same type in a single piece of armor will be removed (with a few exceptions). So, you’ll be able to run two Hand Cannon Loader mods, or two Shotgun Ammo Finder mods, and so forth. The only exceptions to this stacking come from mods that provide no benefit when stacked, such as Fastball and Traction."
[0:37:59] <valriot> 0.4s TTK is fucking out of control
[0:38:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Cerberus+1 also wrecks face in PVP
[0:38:02] <zv1neda> AXE

[0:38:35] <Sabbrewolf> @AngriestPat In the 2.6.1 patch, coming later this month, armor mods will be visible in your Collections, allowing you to browse through all the possibilities and see which ones you have already collected. Additionally, starting next season, the armor mod Collections will get a UI upgrade, allowing them to display armor energy type and cost on the icon, just like they do in your armor socket.
[0:38:36] <CptHarlok> Crimson's been one of my top five for a long time.
[0:38:38] <valriot> @angriestpat Go get Thorn for max scumbaggery

[0:39:51] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you gotta quit your stream now so you're ending on a high note, it's all downhill from here. Kappa
[0:39:57] <%MadMatt2099> @RubberFistFight Oh sure, I have no doubt it's a solid 30. I just wish it ran at 60. I know, silly to expect, given the game has been out for a while already and runs the same.
[0:40:01] <%nicos143> streamer luck
[0:40:02] <Sabbrewolf> @AngriestPat at the start of next season there will be broad-category mods for both the ammo finder and ammo scavenger categories, and they will be automatically unlocked for all players (no need to hunt them down!). This should help round out your builds more easily, and give you more options for tinkering with your ammo no matter what armor energy type you use. they’re also working on some broad category ammo capacity mods.
[0:40:05] <$Mighty_observer> already sweaty
[0:40:06] <%GarbageNirvana> That...yeah okay

[0:40:40] <+SOULSILVERAERO> @oAlec687 Destiny started on console so most people are used to controllers for it

[1:07:56] <CptHarlok> Takes me back to the good old days of my Grasp of Malak.
[1:07:58] <+FennecZephyr> I think I made a mistake turning in my IB stuff before I hit 950 before the artifact
[1:07:59] <%MalekDracarus> What do the element typing on armors do?
[1:08:08] <%Reanimator83> Music at least for me is distracting
[1:08:09] <kevxl> D2 better than 1? D1 was just a grind loot shooter with the same enemys over n over, I hope its not like that here?
[1:08:09] <+crimsonharvest> when will they make a Gradius game out of all these fuckin ships
[1:08:14] <shadytreeofknowledge> Pat looks Jacked af i bet under the shirt is a pillow
[1:08:17] <%dekkitout> Element typing is like polarity in Warframe kinda
[1:08:26] <%SpcOpsBear> I got a Claws of the Wolf with Slideshot and Rampage
[1:08:35] <%theo_marks> aw DIP
[1:08:42] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat have you touched vex offensive? there's a lot of good guns there
[1:08:45] <shadytreeofknowledge> cool glove
[1:08:46] <ChoculaUltra> I got a rock.
[1:08:55] <%theo_marks> rampage and fully auto frame would kill
[1:09:09] <Aydarkzero> show me Kappa

[1:09:59] <%MalekDracarus> Ah, a fellow gold trace wearer. A man of culture
[1:10:03] <%LiquidShake83> no
[1:10:09] <+NeonLight> Outlaw and Demo stacks the reload though, might do with something aside from outlaw right?
[1:10:15] <%pilgrimsayswhat> idk this rifle seems mad solid
[1:10:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> go play cards in Red Dead
[1:10:21] <%Typhaeon> Here I am satisfied with my little compound bow
[1:10:22] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat I thought God roll was Accurized rounds outlaw killclip
[1:10:26] <shadytreeofknowledge> i understand that more
[1:10:31] <ChoculaUltra> oh man just read that This Week at Bungie post. Bottom tree Striker Titans on suicide watch.
[1:10:40] <Swish19XX> Purp gang
[1:10:45] <%dekkitout> Fo real? @ChoculaUltra
[1:10:46] <Bailey__gaming> NEW MONARCHY DIAMOND'S baby
[1:10:58] <shadytreeofknowledge> did Jigglypuff kill you
[1:11:01] <ChoculaUltra> @dekkitout aaaaaand OEM nerfs apparently, for the second time.
[1:11:07] <%skizzuto> got rekt by Jigglypuff lol
[1:11:15] <khancake> The one that is like 15 numbers stringed together?
[1:11:21] <MarylandJutsu> the elmoes are quiet
[1:11:24] <%dekkitout> I mean... the first one didn't take well tajRLY
[1:11:29] <khancake> Again?
[1:11:36] <shadytreeofknowledge> one eyed willy
[1:11:36] <ChoculaUltra> no details just yet, but they specifically mentioned that they're going to be looking at it. Again.
[1:11:38] <+D00msDayDan> not yet, they said they're looking at it so maybe in 6 months they'll do something to it
[1:11:39] <Aydarkzero> oem will prob get nerfed later
[1:11:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> This conversation makes no sense to me
[1:11:44] <%dekkitout> Know the pain of all hunters, titans
[1:11:46] <CptHarlok> They already did I thought.
[1:11:48] <%MalekDracarus> Midnight talons good too but it’s a little too shiny sometimes
[1:11:49] <$Timesteel> it has been nerfed once already
[1:11:50] <shadytreeofknowledge> lost his good eye
[1:11:50] <ChoculaUltra> patch eta Oct 29th.
[1:11:53] <MasterDecoder> Yea, no details, just that they're looking at it
[1:11:57] <$drbuttss> now titans wont have any crutches in pvp
[1:11:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Have you seen the supposed stats for the PS5?
[1:12:00] <shadytreeofknowledge> how many eyes does he got now?
[1:12:06] <%LiquidShake83> slide
[1:12:07] <+bobfriskit> that shader you get at the beginning of the season is cool
[1:12:25] <Sabbrewolf> The change hasn't been announced. Just that they are looking into it
[1:12:26] <$Timesteel> they haven't said yet just that there looking into it
[1:12:33] <valriot> OEM is just bad design tbh, they need to change it or replace it
[1:12:39] <MasterDecoder> No news yet @AngriestPat, just that they're looking at it and watching
[1:12:56] <khancake> Its the worst thing ever if you are not a titan
[1:13:19] <ChoculaUltra> this is just hard speculation from a loser with too much time - but they're probably going to get rid of the enemy tracking and keep the overshield.
[1:13:22] <shadytreeofknowledge> Pat u look like Thor more than u dont
[1:13:25] <%dekkitout> While they're at it, can they nerf Mechaneer's Tricksleeve just cause... SeriousSloth
[1:13:30] <%legendfather_of_giants> That's why Dawnblade bottom tree is so brainless
[1:13:38] <MasterDecoder> @khancake Even if you are a Titan, as a Titan main, I can't stand it, especially because of how ugly it is
[1:13:42] <+bobfriskit> @AngriestPat top tree Arc is better in PVP imo
[1:13:52] <Swish19XX> I like the void explosion super for PvP
[1:13:57] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Which is more humiliating. Being killed as soon as you pop your super or getting hit with a tether or nerf grenade?
[1:13:57] <CptHarlok> Back when I played more, it was really the only standout PvP titan exotic at the time. Everything else was kinda eh... May have changed since I was on though.
[1:14:02] <%dekkitout> Nothing but why not just shit on the lamest exotic
[1:14:07] <californaya> Pat stop feeding
[1:14:11] <ChoculaUltra> the Rat King + Mechaneer Tricksleeve meta is alive dammit! Rat Kings rise up!
[1:14:16] <Retinolgaming> Classic halo trade
[1:14:17] <lennyrager> When should i start grinding in crucible
[1:14:19] <shadytreeofknowledge> yall space wizards got this Space Cowboy holding my Space knife like stay off my lawn
[1:14:20] <khancake> What is the coolest looking but useless titan helmet then?
[1:14:28] <zv1neda> jesus
[1:14:38] <shadytreeofknowledge> yes @zv1neda
[1:14:38] <khancake> Bygones is also a great pulse rifle
[1:14:39] <%dekkitout> He also pins a tracking mark on you
[1:14:43] <+HelloImTom08> probally saint 44
[1:14:43] <doster504> just finished the pursuit for Iron Banner
[1:15:01] <+HelloImTom08> sick Roman General helm but the perk is pretty meh
[1:15:01] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat There is a pretty cool ornament for the One-Eyed Mask that gives you a cyclopean bird face
[1:15:06] <zv1neda> LUL @shadytreeofknowledge
[1:15:13] <$drbuttss> i thought it was saint 14
[1:15:14] <khancake> Riiight it just blinds people who walk into your shield bubble
[1:15:20] <MasterDecoder> @ScreamLord it improves it, but still eh
[1:15:32] <shadytreeofknowledge> always in the weirdest of places @zv1neda
[1:15:34] <doster504> What Power Level is @AngriestPat at?
[1:15:37] <Dutchpotato> Would someone playing the year one free to play version even stand a chance in crucible?
[1:15:53] <ChoculaUltra> crucible? sure. Iron banner? nope.
[1:15:53] <%LiquidShake83> late to that party
[1:16:04] <Aydarkzero> @Dutchpotato theres some decent stuff in the f2p version
[1:16:09] <ScreamLord> @drbuttss Nah, Helm of Saint-14 just makes it so enemies are blinded while in your bubble
[1:16:09] <shadytreeofknowledge> @zv1neda like in Pat's couch Christian what if I was Elmo the Cat
[1:16:20] <+aimeetheviking> most of the playlists don't have a power advantage so you're good free or not
[1:16:21] <AnacondaVirtue> Nope
[1:16:23] <%acexclover> what i wish i had the fucking crimson!!
[1:16:29] <+HelloImTom08> yea im not having any trouble in pvp and im new light, i always felt the light shit was a placebo, if you shoot ppl in the head they die
[1:16:30] <zv1neda> PogChamp \
[1:16:35] <+sleepy_coffee> @peachsaliva how doing, I hope the things are good for you!
[1:17:04] <doster504> I haven't bought Shadowkeep and I'm at 955 so Shadowkeep doesn't give you that much advantage
[1:17:04] <%LiquidShake83> just 5 more
[1:17:06] <MasterDecoder> @ScreamLord It also has a blind-on-block effect with the Shield
[1:17:08] <%barkon345> barkon345 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
[1:17:20] <shadytreeofknowledge> ghosty voice Pat this is Tony the Guy the Kicked with the Dog, why did u have a Dog tied to your Shoe

[1:17:33] <%LiquidShake83> blues
[1:17:42] <+SoundVoid> lol
[1:17:48] <%GarbageNirvana> IB control is so much more fun than regular control
[1:17:59] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid Sound Cannon
[1:18:05] <%shawntk_> what is the difference between the 2 @GarbageNirvana
[1:18:06] <alwayspronking> @AngriestPat I just started playing D2, what should I prioritize?
[1:18:13] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid boooooooooooooooooooom
[1:18:22] <lennyrager> That super reminds me of moira from OW
[1:18:23] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[1:18:27] <ChoculaUltra> man, I'd love a loot filter for Destiny. Auto converting blues into parts would be dreamy.
[1:18:37] <+aimeetheviking> you can sort of do whatever you want now
[1:18:41] <+SoundVoid> No sound escapes the void
[1:18:50] <$Timesteel> prioritize getting to 900 then go from there
[1:18:55] <+aimeetheviking> can just keep running strikes and bounties forever
[1:18:56] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid even a Fart?
[1:18:58] <+aimeetheviking> truth
[1:19:02] <%dekkitout> @ChoculaUltra That's on the very long list of things the first game had
[1:19:04] <+SoundVoid> Yes
[1:19:10] <alwayspronking> okay, make number go up, got it.
[1:19:12] <%LiquidShake83> what your artifacts level?
[1:19:24] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid whats it smell like tho
[1:19:30] <+SoundVoid> Death
[1:19:47] <ChoculaUltra> @dekkitout I've been so focused on shaders like Glowhoo that are still in D1 that I completely forgot about the QoL D1 had lmao
[1:20:00] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid Anubis Death or just Tony the Boatman?
[1:20:04] <ChoculaUltra> dammit Bungo!
[1:20:10] <%dekkitout> Remember Glass Needles and Three of Coins CoolStoryBob
[1:20:21] <+SoundVoid> Boatmen

[1:21:35] <%dekkitout> Someone's handle is 'Scrota, Sack of Oryx'
[1:21:45] <Mad_Morpho> Ana Bray's Bathwater was good name
[1:21:48] <Ion_Laser> @dekkitout LUL
[1:21:49] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid im kinda like Headphone girl and Gambit
[1:22:01] <%rainwater739> Isn't "Shlorpy" the name of one of Pat's testicles?
[1:22:06] <ChoculaUltra> I've seen a couple of Cayde-69s and shamelessly chuckled each time.
[1:22:11] <KillerGibbs> played with the Wendy's 4 for $4 menu the other day that was pretty fun
[1:22:17] <shadytreeofknowledge> @soundvoid wanna make a lazy Superhero team?
[1:22:29] <+Javaa01> Deathbringer can be absolutely disgusting in PvP in the right hands
[1:22:29] <+SoundVoid> Sure why not
[1:22:30] <ScreamLord> @acexclover Deathbringer seems to be a worse Gjallarhorn
[1:22:34] <valriot> @angriestpat They best I saw was people pushing Raid Shadow Legend links
[1:22:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> Deathbringer is really good if you can reliably get power in comp
[1:22:39] <+river_city98> jesus

[1:29:52] <californaya> @rainwater739 Tabletop Simulator
[1:29:54] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat how did you grind out recluse? with a group? did you use any cheese?
[1:29:56] <mrvidicus> @rainwater739 I've been getting into WArframe lately as a good "Shut my brain down and occupy my hands," game.
[1:29:56] <%dekkitout> Phoenix Protocol and Bad Juju makes me a very happy fire-bird man
[1:29:58] <%pilgrimsayswhat> Voidwalker fucking rules dude
[1:30:03] <vexicbayn> Also geomag RULES
[1:30:07] <%arancet> which of your space wizard dollies do you prefer? warframe or destiny?
[1:30:10] <%TaifuDragon> Damn you. Damn you for having Phoenix protocol. I have been trying for a year and it never drops. Damn you, Pat. Damn you
[1:30:14] <%MegboyManuel> Void Titan for the BIGGEST shields
[1:30:16] <%rainwater739> @mrvidicus That sounds right up my alley!
[1:30:24] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat it takes a bajillion farming, and it isn't menagerie
[1:30:25] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat turn in triibutes by spending planetary mats
[1:30:26] <shadytreeofknowledge> @angriestpat and he think Justin Bieber is cooler than Michael J. Fox
[1:30:27] <$Timesteel> bad juju isn't from menagerie
[1:30:34] <%LiquidShake83> call up three people and go to town
[1:30:38] <valriot> Go to the Tribute Hall @angriestpat
[1:30:38] <%dekkitout> Play the game alot and get 13-45 triumphs for triumph hall
[1:30:40] <$Timesteel> its from the tribute hall
[1:30:41] <Quietshun13> yo
[1:30:41] <+bobfriskit> bad juju is not menageire
[1:30:42] <shadytreeofknowledge> see he doesnt Argue Chat Shame him
[1:30:47] <%MegboyManuel> Hey is the two tailed fox any good?
[1:30:51] <Decoy_44> bad juju is from the tribute hall
[1:30:51] <%MalekDracarus> It’s just tribute hall for bad juju
[1:30:52] <%dekkitout> 13 gets the gun, 45 gets the catalyst
[1:30:52] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Bad Juju you get from the tribute hall. Its veerry tedious to get though
[1:31:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat bad juju only requires like 20 tributes, you can do it without touching menagerie
[1:31:03] <%VantomPayne> two tailed fox is good for gambit is what i heard
[1:31:13] <%deviljhojho94> what is you doing
[1:31:14] <%LiquidShake83> tribute duhh
[1:31:15] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat get your chalice quest dome, do the achievement to get tributes
[1:31:16] <%Farples> Spend mats
[1:31:16] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you can spend planetary mats to get everything you need
[1:31:17] <+bobfriskit> Its like trophies
[1:31:18] <Decoy_44> open the chest behind werner on the nessus barge to access tribute hall
[1:31:18] <shadytreeofknowledge> tribute shyt dumbass
[1:31:19] <mrvidicus> @rainwater739 Besides the occasional cutscene/lore drop you get, most of the game is just playing procedurally generated levels with all kinds of different modes, alone or with others.
[1:31:19] <+D00msDayDan> tribute hall is secretly a training room
[1:31:20] <%TaifuDragon> You just get trophies
[1:31:20] <$drbuttss> you place tributes
[1:31:21] <%PinkSuprende> you pay for statues
[1:31:26] <%Farples> Spend mats to get trphies
[1:31:27] <%Ninestempest> @AngriestPat buy tributes with resources (or get them from Triumphs) and place them and then you can get bad juju with enough
[1:31:30] <%TaifuDragon> You can get trophies from other places too, check your triumphs
[1:31:30] <%afronooch> unlock tributes
[1:31:32] <%dekkitout> It's a trophy room/damage test field/free ammo fill
[1:31:34] <%afronooch> test guns
[1:31:36] <valriot> Grind tributes, basically Triumphs
[1:31:36] <%PinkSuprende> its money sink for nothing else to work for
[1:31:36] <%VantomPayne> you pay money to get anime figurine
[1:31:40] <shadytreeofknowledge> fuck somebodies mom
[1:31:43] <%laserbeaming> So... what kept me out of Destiny for a while is that apparently you NEED to do PvP to get good stuff for PvE, did they fix that?
[1:31:43] <%Farples> Ye
[1:31:43] <$Timesteel> its a training room basically
[1:31:44] <MasterDecoder> It's a Material sink @AngriestPat, do bounties for a discount
[1:31:46] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat bounties give discounts on the statues
[1:31:47] <%MalekDracarus> @angriestpat 18 trophies. And you pay big money for them
[1:31:48] <%Ninestempest> Yes, but we're talking 100s of planetary matts
[1:31:50] <Aydarkzero> @AngriestPat at the time of release it was intended to be a sink for Shadowkeep
[1:31:50] <+bobfriskit> @AngriestPat Its like hey, Look at these enemies models
[1:31:53] <+redmageryan> it's 18 tributes for bad juju and 45 for the catalist
[1:31:54] <+Astral_Directive> Kinda becomes like a big playground dick measuring arena
[1:31:55] <KillerGibbs> it's a shooting range too
[1:31:58] <coldsama> And it also works as firing range kinda
[1:31:58] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat Some trophies come from other places. You unlock a few from playing Iron Banner actually
[1:31:59] <MrNoobMcSalt> @AngriestPat it's a trophy room/ sim room of sorts. Mostly it's for bad juju at 12/15 and it's catalyst at 30 or 45
[1:32:00] <%DedlokPM> and do bounties from the statue to lower the costs of the tributes
[1:32:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat 1% for each bounty
[1:32:03] <%deviljhojho94> thats the way it is
[1:32:05] <Decoy_44> have to place 45 for the catalyst
[1:32:08] <khancake> 12 easy payments of 19.99 pat and the bad juju is yours
[1:32:10] <%PinkSuprende> you buy jpegs of dregs and put them where you want
[1:32:12] <%dekkitout> The first day it came out, Spider was sellin all the materials to buy the tributes
[1:32:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> maybe if you're luckly not as easy as Porn makes it looks
[1:32:19] <%rainwater739> @mrvidicus Thanks so much! It's hard to find a multiplayer that will be fun without my idiot-ness pissing other players off
[1:32:20] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Lore wise... think of it as the Guardians trophy room and resting quarters
[1:32:30] <Decoy_44> this map is cancer
[1:32:47] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you could probably get Bad Juju as you are now without any discount
[1:32:52] <shadytreeofknowledge> the map is a crab
[1:32:53] <+ZoopZoops> Warcraft 3 was the best game of all time
[1:32:53] <%pilgrimsayswhat> I miss my explosive Eyasluna NotLikeThis
[1:32:59] <%sshen> Bring back my sniper shooting through walls on this map
[1:33:00] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> This map is poorly balance for long range
[1:33:26] <zv1neda> SWEAT
[1:33:32] <+Javaa01> Disgusting/10
[1:33:34] <$Timesteel> would have really preferred exodus blue or rusted lands over this map
[1:33:37] <%dekkitout> It was worse in the first game, there was a lane where a sniper can pick off an entire team grabbing heavy ammo
[1:33:43] <shadytreeofknowledge> going to Prom
[1:33:43] <%segonian> segonian subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 23 months! Good to see you back. Good break?
[1:33:54] <khancake> chaperone -clap- is -clap- legit -clap-
[1:33:54] <shadytreeofknowledge> dont drink Pat
[1:33:55] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Chaperon's pretty good. And the Ornaments are snazy
[1:34:00] <mrvidicus> "Defeated Gingermage," killing your own kind, Pat?
[1:34:04] <%PlagueOfGripes> went back to controller for pvp? I remember you describing its autoaim as aggressive
[1:34:09] <shadytreeofknowledge> and wear Condoms in your shoes and on your fingers
[1:34:24] <Monkeyweed21> you ran into the death
[1:34:24] <%sshen> Remember in D1 that the first IB sniper could get a perk to literally shoot through walls
[1:34:24] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> pat blind
[1:34:25] <khancake> pat why would you walk into an enemy grenade
[1:34:32] <Dark_Wint3r> Is he playing on Pc?
[1:34:33] <+CezrDaPleazr> Sup Pat, hows Destiny?
[1:34:35] <%ChaosAethr> `````````Flying Duffman awesome name
[1:34:38] <%afronooch> he is
[1:34:46] <%dekkitout> Someone explain to me why the Chappy ornament hat makes the gun model larger give it more range? LUL
[1:34:51] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat basically you check the log book under locations / tribute hall, you have to get 20 tributes including the ones u can buy fir money/ mats
[1:34:54] <+Evitron1> F
[1:34:55] <shadytreeofknowledge> for Protection Condoms the Worlds only real armor from Zombie Sperms
[1:35:08] <%MegboyManuel> so why is everyone i know runnign PvP in Destiny 2
[1:35:10] <IminyourBase> that's a stupid reason to walk into a grenade though
[1:35:12] <%PlagueOfGripes> big gun shoot far-er
[1:35:18] <khancake> 'Great shot kid don't get cocky'
[1:35:25] <+SoundVoid> Classic friendly grenade
[1:35:28] <@BigNaturalMan59> whens the ffxi stream
[1:35:29] <%MegboyManuel> im in a call with friends and theyre running pvp too, ooooooh
[1:35:55] <Bailey__gaming> can someome tell him what I said?
[1:35:57] <$drbuttss> that rhymes
[1:36:06] <%chrishnaw> Is the PVP fun if I'm playing on WiFi?
[1:36:06] <khancake> That helmet literally looked like a bucket
[1:36:07] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat The newest Ornament for the Chaperon also actually improves it slightly. It makes the barrel slightly longer and gives it more range. I don't think Bungie ment to do that LUL
[1:36:08] <%PlagueOfGripes> jesus, 957 power? I think the cap was like 250-300 or something when I stopped
[1:36:17] <%MegboyManuel> the horn helmet is big cool aesthetic though
[1:36:18] <shadytreeofknowledge> when is Pat Running that 5k @peachsaliva u said when u were drunk he would
[1:36:24] <%Deathtronhammer> Mess with the bull; you get the horns
[1:36:30] <lennyrager> Do i need shadow keep
[1:36:35] <%dekkitout> You start at 750 now, so technically, the cap never moved tajC
[1:36:44] <shadytreeofknowledge> @deathtronhammer what if the bull has no balls
[1:37:02] <Aydarkzero> it's super good
[1:37:02] <%deviljhojho94> nice hat dork
[1:37:04] <+Javaa01> @lennyrager Not unless you're up to date with the story, and want to continue into Shadowkeep
[1:37:05] <%PlagueOfGripes> farm iron banner for Throbbo
[1:37:06] <%pilgrimsayswhat> in the FAE
[1:37:06] <$Timesteel> anyways tribute hall is basically the simulacrum but you need to donate mats to unlock enemies to shoot
[1:37:08] <%pilgrimsayswhat> FACE
[1:37:15] <Monkeyweed21> guns are generally quite good at shooting people
[1:37:19] <+SoundVoid> I would hope so
[1:37:21] <%MalekDracarus> I reset crucible rank before I realized I forgot to pick up the chaperone quest...
[1:37:24] <shadytreeofknowledge> ur Cooler than me
[1:37:31] <%deviljhojho94> I've heard destiny lore is the hypest shit ever but barely touched upon in the games themselves
[1:37:36] <%LiquidShake83> i like parcel of stardust for kinetic slot shotty.
[1:37:37] <Monkeyweed21> Do you have Bad Juju
[1:37:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> sleeper too

[1:37:46] <shadytreeofknowledge> Mountain Dew
[1:37:47] <%dekkitout> Le Monarque
[1:37:48] <%MegboyManuel> mountain top is disgusting
[1:37:49] <Monkeyweed21> Truth or THUNDERLORD
[1:37:52] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat when you get 1K, it's the most toxic ever
[1:37:53] <%MegboyManuel> esp with weapons of light
[1:37:57] <%chrishnaw> Barehanded. Just punch the other players
[1:38:01] <%TaifuDragon> For filthy invader kills, the MG is unparallel
[1:38:02] <%dekkitout> Invader HATE it if the map has bad invade spawns
[1:38:05] <%PlagueOfGripes> Have they ever mentioned why they still have you replicate color swatches instead of just picking them when you dye gear?
[1:38:06] <%ChaosAethr> @AngriestPat Toxic Or Honest
[1:38:14] <iggdrafolium> I think I heard that Activision and this game broke relationship or something?
[1:38:16] <shadytreeofknowledge> Cool Ranch and the smell of Farts
[1:38:17] <%MalekDracarus> Hammerhead bois
[1:38:18] <Aydarkzero> no truth :(
[1:38:19] <%CirnoIce> @AngriestPat just steal heavy ammo for hammerhead and 4 tap everyone
[1:38:20] <%PlagueOfGripes> Is it some sort of engine issue? Because that seems doubtful
[1:38:31] <Aydarkzero> rip
[1:38:33] <Bailey__gaming> @angriestpat basicly you need to check your logbook under locations / the tributes hall, then you need 20 of a mix of the achieves and buying tributes
[1:38:35] <+SoundVoid> Cheese your victory spyCheese
[1:38:43] <%VantomPayne> holy shit pat you wearing exact the same thing as i do
[1:38:48] <shadytreeofknowledge> @plagueofgripes hey Why do fools fall in love?

[1:38:58] <%TaifuDragon> @PlagueOfGripes engine jank. But at least now the consumables can be remade for shards for nearly no cost
[1:39:00] <khancake> Saladin is bending players over now
[1:39:06] <+DesmondtheOrc> yo is that a fucking shaxx helmet?
[1:39:07] <%dekkitout> The popular statement thrown around for why all the shaders aren't in your inventory like mods is "memory restrictions"
[1:39:15] <%depressed_skeleton> wow look at this pointy hat
[1:39:19] <%TaifuDragon> It's got something to do with the limit on the amount you can carry yeah
[1:39:25] <shadytreeofknowledge> check the Chat we Toxic

[1:46:40] <sonofthedeepsouth> Goddamn Elmo is YUGE
[1:46:41] <startstoprepeat> maybe reload before running into the enemy
[1:46:48] <%dekkitout> That guy using Le Monarque, that guy's a champ~
[1:47:00] <%SWFanatic> warframe changed their UI or something I guess
[1:47:11] <%SWFanatic> I know pat wouldn't cheat on warframe. He's a good Tenno.
[1:47:23] <$crusader_heide> @plagueofgripes loveing ur plaguetober buddy ^_^

[1:49:29] <%Typhaeon> This is the PvP mode I have the most fun with
[1:49:46] <collind99> @angriestpat Just listened to the podcast. I don’t think they’re doing live action Batman Beyond because there’s apparently an intention to do a Spider Verse style animated movie. Also I’m not mad that they’re doing Pattinson as Bruce because it’s supposed to be a noir detective story and we’ve never gotten that before in a movie.
[1:49:52] <VJdarkworld> boop
[1:49:55] <%MalekDracarus> @angriestpat do you have Outbreak perfected? If you don’t just know that quest is fucked.
[1:49:55] <bigstupidjellyfish1337> time for baby kissing
[1:49:57] <%Quigsies> It's a good pve and pvp balance
[1:50:04] <$crusader_heide> Pp has human nose
[1:50:08] <+Javaa01> It's very much like a condensed version of Attrition from Titanfall
[1:50:17] <1matheuw> is it a pvp version of index right?
[1:50:21] <zv1neda> i just did the outbreak perfected quest it is fucked
[1:50:22] <+Reveresao> *-*-+9

[1:54:32] <+D00msDayDan> shoot gun good, get better gun

[2:00:40] <Aydarkzero> Saint-14 is so cool
[2:00:40] <Calek> Alan Wake American Nightmare is a neat Groundhog Day game
[2:00:43] <+Aeriqui> like if the vex give you respect theres no way they let you die
[2:00:46] <%Aeoneth> That and he headputted a Fallen Kell to death
[2:00:48] <%dekkitout> Also he headbutted a Kell
[2:01:00] <+Pyroclase> I just tuned in, why the heck is Pat playing NORMAL gambit
[2:01:01] <+Aeriqui> they woukd want to simulate his combat data forever

[2:01:42] <ScreamLord> They couldn't even kill him fairly. They had to slowly drain his light until he couldn't revive again
[2:01:44] <%depressed_skeleton> It's pat fault
[2:01:45] <Aydarkzero> the crazy thing about Saint-14 was that all of his heroism was to live up to the legend that the player character did
[2:01:46] <thehashslingingslashers> slows you down
[2:01:48] <mrblack499> sure pat
[2:01:49] <MasterDecoder> @Order_of_Mystery That's not how that works

[2:03:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> @acexclover wasn't 6 fronts after he got kicked out?
[2:03:15] <MutedOnTwitter> So is it any good?
[2:03:21] <+Aeriqui> legit all of the vanguard are anime busted
[2:03:28] <frenchpooper> @AngriestPat boi u thicc!
[2:03:30] <Aydarkzero> Guardians are busted
[2:03:32] <%LiquidShake83> git guud
[2:03:34] <@StridentSong> Pat's getting too cold to sweat now
[2:03:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> Shaxx is most busted after Ikora
[2:03:46] <%acexclover> osiris participated in the battle became warlock vanguard then got exiled for his studies with his desciples in tow
[2:03:48] <Aydarkzero> Ikora is actually stronger though LUL
[2:03:52] <+Aeriqui> Shaxx killed an ahamkara with his bare hands
[2:03:59] <+Aeriqui> Shaxx is scared of Ikora
[2:04:06] <Aydarkzero> ^
[2:04:09] <%acexclover> they even say it was like osiris was on every front at once he was so good
[2:04:10] <ScreamLord> The Sweatening begins
[2:04:11] <valriot> SHAXX FUCKS
[2:04:13] <MutedOnTwitter> Also, super novice, is Destiny (1) even worth booting up?
[2:04:14] <%legendfather_of_giants> Ikora blew up Chicago
[2:04:16] <Teh_Un> Add Blockers huh
[2:04:16] <%king_wragles> Most people should be scared of Ikora
[2:04:17] <%dekkitout> Did Shaxx then turn the Ahamkara into a pelt and proceed to shag Mara Sov on it?
[2:04:20] <+Aeriqui> Ikora has never lost in the crucible and has taken on teams by herself
[2:04:24] <Aydarkzero> @valriot the helmet stayed on
[2:04:29] <%LiquidShake83> mortis
[2:04:31] <ScreamLord> @valriot The Helmet stays on
[2:04:31] <+armor_kuma> @MutedOnTwitter Not unless you have all the dlc
[2:04:46] <+Javaa01> Oh yeah, you've been jobbing it super hard for half the round
[2:04:46] <+Aeriqui> like, she can cast multiple supers simultaneously
[2:04:52] <MutedOnTwitter> @armor_kuma I see.
[2:04:56] <+CBN16> take the high ground hut
[2:04:56] <+Aeriqui> thats soooo busted
[2:05:02] <%legendfather_of_giants> She can also use all three subclasses at once
[2:05:09] <%Kiiper> Destiny 1 is still good, but yeah you need everything
[2:05:24] <+Aeriqui> like i'm not worried about the vex gate she's building bc she can probably defend it by herself one handed
[2:05:32] <+CBN16> you guys got it
[2:05:58] <+Pyroclase> Who builds an evil boss portal directly across from the ramen shop anyway?!
[2:06:00] <%acexclover> shaw helped push through a line with nothing but his super even took out a fallen walker on his own and i think he threw saladin through a walker at one point
[2:06:01] <%dekkitout> And yet they let Drifter in the tower...
[2:06:03] <shadytreeofknowledge> the Olympic arena is fine
[2:06:05] <%Kiiper> Ikora is way more badass then we've seen her be
[2:06:07] <%acexclover> shax*
[2:06:14] <%tweedler92> Gives her something to do I guess?
[2:06:15] <valriot> @angriestpat Saint14 is gonna come out of it, calling it now
[2:06:15] <+NeonLight> We kill the undying mind multiple times, it honestly isnt *that* big a threat if it comes through
[2:06:16] <%GarbageNirvana> Vanguard just never stops fucking it up
[2:06:18] <%Kiiper> unlike that chump Zavala
[2:06:18] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat she can handle it. She nuked Chicago
[2:06:20] <zv1neda> god that dance makes you look like a fucking goober
[2:06:22] <+calvinf10> Ikoras plan is great because theres about 10,000 ways it could go wrong
[2:06:24] <+Aeriqui> i mean if it was anyone else other than ikora, it would be a bad idea
[2:06:26] <Crankthulhu> Would people say this game has too much visual clutter?
[2:06:28] <%king_wragles> So, is that THE SMG Pat has? I'm still a bit out of the loop
[2:06:29] <%depressed_skeleton> @AngriestPat Hey pat, buying currency to buy cosmetics.. they're so neat & tempting.
[2:06:33] <+Aeriqui> but ikora is standing right there
[2:06:33] <+D00msDayDan> that portal's either gonna destabilize at the end of the season or ikora will tear it down, serial continuity is now something destiny actively takes into consideration
[2:06:40] <+Posh_Cat> doogHi doogPaw
[2:06:40] <+Aeriqui> so we're fine
[2:06:43] <Crankthulhu> Because I could barely understand what was going on in my first Gambit match
[2:06:56] <%SirTopHat_III> SirTopHat_III subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 30 months huh. Nice.
[2:06:57] <%acexclover> i think she is trying to have osiris be able to visit the tower whenever he wants
[2:06:57] <%king_wragles> That is Recluse
[2:06:59] <shadytreeofknowledge> seeya Pat ill be back gotta go Save the World
[2:07:01] <Don_Discovery> hey pat hows it going you playing PC or console? have you done the shadowkeep raid yet?
[2:07:09] <%dekkitout> Hey man, a hip fire sniper is a god damn unicorn!
[2:07:21] <+Aeriqui> also osiris is literally just getting stronger and stronger running infinite simulations
[2:07:34] <%SlimeSlimeSlime> You should always wait a little before getting in there.
[2:07:39] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Hip-Fire on a sniper is like a scope for a sword. Useless
[2:07:45] <+Aeriqui> meanwhile hunters have Bray and Eris Morn technically?
[2:07:53] <%acexclover> @screamlord agreed
[2:07:55] <+Aeriqui> but no vanguard :(
[2:07:55] <+Posh_Cat> Wow that smug really has no recoil

[2:08:28] <%king_wragles> @Posh_Cat it's the epitome of point and shoot
[2:08:31] <+Posh_Cat> Is eris a Hunter?
[2:08:34] <+calvinf10> 15 motes in the ground tho
[2:08:41] <+Aeriqui> eris was a hunter yes
[2:08:49] <+Aeriqui> but she got her light ripped out of her
[2:08:49] <+jyeowa> sure you did patrick
[2:08:50] <Aydarkzero> @Posh_Cat yes
[2:08:51] <+Pyroclase> You totally teamwiped on stream one time, I was there
[2:08:54] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat you need to do that for a quest
[2:08:58] <%dekkitout> Emphasis on 'was'
[2:08:58] <+Posh_Cat> And there’s me trying to get 21% delirium
[2:09:01] <Dutchpotato> Sure pat
[2:09:13] <+Javaa01> SMH can't even get a 5k in a single invasion
[2:09:19] <+calvinf10> the first time i ever invaded i got an army of one with thunderlord lol
[2:09:24] <+Aeriqui> also the biology of eris ripping hive eyes out and slamming them into her skull is wild
[2:09:25] <%acexclover> and titans have shax saladin saint 14 and rayz laser
[2:09:26] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I once used a Thundercrash in Control to wipe the entire enemy team. It felt amazing
[2:09:36] <+mgskomododragon> what is that rocket launcher and how do i get it?
[2:09:44] <+jyeowa> he didn't even get the kill and he's so happy, this is why i love pat
[2:09:45] <+Posh_Cat> always saw eris as warlock material..huh dizzyThink
[2:09:51] <+Pyroclase> Did you know there's a hidden triumph for getting 7 kills in a single invasion?
[2:09:54] <Aydarkzero> @mgskomododragon finish the shadowkeep story and then do a few more quest from Eris
[2:09:56] <%dekkitout> That's Deathbringer, and it's from the new expac
[2:10:21] <+Posh_Cat> Polaris Lance is surprisingly good for invading
[2:10:28] <%acexclover> and yea eris was a hunter till she got fucked up in that pit
[2:10:28] <theamazingroberto> why is he angry pat now and not angriest pat? did i miss something?
[2:10:38] <+calvinf10> Deathbringer seems EXTREMELY GOOD in gambit?? like a indirect fire weapon that can instakill
[2:10:42] <%Saltmeisterr> bazooka
[2:10:58] <+CBN16> bruh
[2:11:00] <+Aeriqui> Polaris Lance is incredible for invading
[2:11:01] <+Pyroclase> @calvinf10 clearly you never played during the sleep/queenbreaker meta
[2:11:02] <Ion_Laser> F
[2:11:07] <WeebFever> died in the piss
[2:11:08] <ScreamLord> Deathbringer = Slightly worse Gjallarhorn
[2:11:11] <+Posh_Cat> Haha
[2:11:11] <+Aeriqui> Its how i got dredgen
[2:11:19] <+CBN16> blame the controller
[2:11:26] <%dekkitout> I still have wounds that ache from Queenbreaker
[2:11:28] <+Aeriqui> Polaris Lance is my favorite gun in the game highkey
[2:11:34] <+Aeriqui> its so beautiful
[2:11:36] <+Pyroclase> Polaris Lance is amazing yeah.
[2:11:50] <+Pyroclase> But I just got an outlaw/demolitionist reckless oracle and it's amazing
[2:11:54] <+calvinf10> @Pyroclase no i know of that meta, im just saying deathbringer is also rlly strong
[2:12:05] <%dekkitout> Polaris proccing playing with fire and sun spots is da best
[2:12:17] <+Posh_Cat> did anyone of you keep the masterwork prototype from the Polaris Lance quest?
[2:12:25] <+Pyroclase> Oh wow
[2:12:29] <%3Xgilly> LUL
[2:12:30] <%dekkitout> Oh yes
[2:12:32] <+Pyroclase> I've never seen that before
[2:12:36] <+Posh_Cat> Really glad I did
[2:12:42] <%ArcanumMBD> pro invade
[2:12:43] <+calvinf10> Ooooh boy
[2:12:44] <luckyifpurple> Mortis
[2:13:13] <%Chichen> are we
[2:13:23] <%dekkitout> Do you not feel like John Travolta from Pulp Fiction?
[2:13:25] <Finakala> He's having a great time
[2:13:25] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just to be clear, what happened was Pat was blown through the portal to be the last kill right?
[2:13:28] <%king_wragles> YES
[2:13:32] <+jyeowa> it super damages you pat
[2:13:36] <+Andrizzleton> they're stupid
[2:13:37] <Cranky_Construct> I wonder if I should get back into Destiny, this looks pretty fun
[2:13:38] <+Pyroclase> all grenades hurt you
[2:13:43] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat All Grenades hurt you
[2:13:49] <%DedlokPM> All grenades that do damage hurt you
[2:14:06] <+Pyroclase> emlo
[2:14:09] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Some hurt more than other's tho
[2:14:16] <Don_Discovery> elmo Pog
[2:14:22] <+Posh_Cat> My destiny emotes consist of baking cookies, pouring tea, sitting impatiently on a chair and dinging...
[2:14:39] <%ArcanumMBD> yeeet
[2:14:46] <+Posh_Cat> dizzyTea
[2:14:52] <+Javaa01> Well, at least you died before the invader got in
[2:14:52] <+Andrizzleton> heal the primeal, HEAL HIM!

[2:15:42] <%dekkitout> You know who says that? Genji/Reaper mains
[2:15:44] <%legendfather_of_giants> TRACKJING AND CLUSTER IS GREAT IN GAMBIT
[2:15:46] <+Pyroclase> Are you saving that black armory bounty for izanagi's burden?
[2:15:47] <+BishopBain> Pat, pet the baby. Kappa
[2:15:51] <+GreenCMD> are you using the double artifact mod glitch for grenade spam?
[2:15:54] <%Chichen> EMLO
[2:15:57] <ScreamLord> That is a REALLY good roll
[2:16:00] <%king_wragles> HE GOT BLAST RADIUS MASTERWORK?
[2:16:00] <+tsunami_33> this is on PC with a xbox controller right?, cause this looks and loads way to fast to be console
[2:16:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat That roll is great in Gambit ONLY
[2:16:03] <%Chichen> bye emlo
[2:16:07] <+mortis_forsaken> wow pat is a dirty warlock
[2:16:09] <%Deathtronhammer> Bymo
[2:16:10] <+Javaa01> Tracking Cluster with extra Radius is fantastic
[2:16:13] <+Posh_Cat> dizzyWtf that moment when your running for the portal shooting to indicate this and they run through before you anyway l...
[2:16:29] <Finakala> Emlo gone
[2:16:39] <ScreamLord> A Half-Truth is you will
[2:16:42] <%dekkitout> So a Reality Check?
[2:16:42] <+PerrinIsDead> Hey boys
[2:16:44] <%depressed_skeleton> ew
[2:16:46] <Thalchampz> eeeey
[2:16:46] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Those teammates really need to start carrying their weight and also some of yours. Lazy!
[2:16:47] <%dekkitout> GOTEEM
[2:16:50] <Quietshun13> amazing
[2:16:54] <+calvinf10> i really like how the drifter is sketchy as shit but they still let him be in the tower
[2:16:56] <%mh9s> pat's gonna go eat elmo's food
[2:17:02] <+Posh_Cat> doogPaw Hunter over here
[2:17:02] <PsideFxX> BURN
[2:17:02] <%DedlokPM> @tsunami_33 yeah it is pc because he was asked about whether or not pad players are matched with other pad players earlier so I would assume yeah, pc on controller
[2:17:08] <WhereIsWill> warlocks rise up!
[2:17:09] <%Chichen> I've heard the new player experience is super fucked in this game right now. How annoying is it to actually start up?
[2:17:09] <+Aeriqui> the drifter is my new dad
[2:17:14] <%king_wragles> @mh9s that's fine, Elmo can just eat his own hair.
[2:17:15] <mrblack499> JUST No @AngriestPat
[2:17:25] <+Aeriqui> i have the papers right here
[2:17:37] <+Pyroclase> Hey Pat, why not play Gambit Prime?
[2:17:38] <Ion_Laser> :D
[2:17:40] <Don_Discovery> MEOW
[2:17:45] <Don_Discovery> ITS EMPTY D:
[2:17:49] <%Deathtronhammer> Cause it scares them when food isn't infinite
[2:18:00] <%Chichen> @AngriestPat Whisker fatigue usually. If its not a flat bowl they get tired of their whiskers rubbing against the bowl and just stop eating
[2:18:05] <%Kiiper> @Chichen It's fine, until it hits you with three full pages of quests
[2:18:07] <iwa5h4ck3d> Are you gonna play Code Vein
[2:18:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Chichen it's not fucked, you just start with all your abilities unlocked and vets are salty
[2:18:12] <%GarbageNirvana> What Chichen said
[2:18:21] <Finakala> He did play Code Vein
[2:18:24] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> They can't dive in to a half empty bowl scrooge mcduck style with an empty spot! Theyd break their head
[2:18:33] <+tsunami_33> @dedlokpm thanks for the confirmation, because I was gonna chuck my ps4pro if this was on an xbox one
[2:18:33] <%king_wragles> @iwa5h4ck3d he's already played it, you can check it out in the videos too!
[2:18:38] <+Posh_Cat> chaperone is very underused
[2:18:40] <%Chichen> my cat started eating a lot more once I bought him a more flattened bowl with low sides
[2:18:45] <sjcodan> If I was to get back into destiny, does that mean I gotta buy $70 of DLC for my $60 game?
[2:18:46] <@lewdskeletor13> Poor cats
[2:18:46] <mrblack499> is he still playing Nioh
[2:19:00] <@StridentSong> YEYEYE OUTBREAK BABY
[2:19:12] <%Chichen> @Kiiper @legendfather_of_giants got it. I'll probably try it soon. Just swamped with games and life righ tnow
[2:19:16] <+Pyroclase> Do you have the catalyst for it?
[2:19:20] <+Aeriqui> money is loot
[2:19:20] <+Javaa01> You need money to glam your shit
[2:19:25] <+Aeriqui> guardians need loot
[2:19:25] <Finakala> What even is a Mote anyway ferociousThink
[2:19:26] <%ArcanumMBD> @legendfather_of_giants that is 100% not the reason people are saying it's fucked. There's just a metric assload of stuff to do between campaigns, bounties, pursuits, and a myriad of activities
[2:19:29] <%Maids4lyfe> guardians need money
[2:19:37] <%Maids4lyfe> motes are darkness manifest
[2:19:38] <%tweedler92> I still gotta get outbreak but man I'm garbo at platforming
[2:19:45] <sjcodan> Oh god I forgot pat plays FPS on a controller
[2:19:45] <+Posh_Cat> Guardians have money... it’s glimmer
[2:19:53] <+Pyroclase> Zero Hour is AWFUL to play as a warlock
[2:20:04] <%legendfather_of_giants> @ArcanumMBD yeah, there's some of that. I just started my own 2 alts, so I feel it too
[2:20:07] <%ArcanumMBD> the game just throws everything at you immediately now, which is easily overwhelming for new players
[2:20:07] <Finakala> Darkness manifest? Sounds edgy
[2:20:10] <+Aeriqui> zero hour heroic i have done so many times
[2:20:23] <+Aeriqui> i have nightmares of the outside section
[2:20:28] <+Posh_Cat> that is a meaty sounding shotgun I like it
[2:20:31] <+Aeriqui> and trevor
[2:20:39] <+GovernmentmYass> people who get angry about minor costume changes to underage characters in games like TMS because censorship are the lamest people alive.
[2:20:44] <+Pyroclase> Me and two friends got the shyip and catalust from heroic zero hour because one of them had internet so bad they'd never load in and the timer would never start
[2:21:11] <%3Xgilly> Yeah why dont you get a tank in gambit
[2:21:17] <+Aeriqui> lmao thats incredible
[2:21:58] <%Quigsies> F

[2:22:52] <Kingdom_65> Pat, shoot the floor next to him. Not directly at him.
[2:22:57] <dynamitedoki> CHOKED
[2:23:08] <PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Pat you aim at the ground not AT the person...
[2:23:14] <Qwertoqwerto> Aim floor small man
[2:23:15] <+Pyroclase> Pat, are you aware that Gunnora's axe is a slug shotgun?
[2:23:18] <Roz_Lynd> CMON PAT FUCK EM UP!!
[2:23:29] <%depressed_skeleton> We're your friends.
[2:23:30] <Kingdom_65> Pat you smelly gamer boy, shoot their feet not their nipples.
[2:23:33] <%depressed_skeleton> don't look at destiny friends.
[2:23:33] <alcett> is this pvp/pve ? some alterac valley bullshit?
[2:23:34] <+Pyroclase> PAT
[2:23:38] <+Pyroclase> HE WAS MELEEING YOU
[2:23:44] <chambatron> Behind you dude cmon
[2:23:47] <%Chichen> I could hear him meleeing you LUL
[2:23:54] <Finakala> Well he finally killed someone with the rocket launcher
[2:23:54] <%Chichen> welcome to speakers vs headset unfortunately
[2:23:56] <Roz_Lynd> @alcett it's a PvPvE sort of thing
[2:23:59] <LozsCat> Pat are you deaf
[2:24:01] <+Javaa01> He got some good hits in, the Titan, that is

[2:24:32] <startstoprepeat> personally i find tracking module on bad omens kinda crappy since the projectile moves so fast it barely influences it
[2:24:36] <WhereIsWill> dab on em pat!
[2:24:37] <Roz_Lynd> you want a hand pat?
[2:25:02] <+Pyroclase> Supposedly the faster a rocket, the better it tracks
[2:25:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> you dont keep Heavy ammo between rounds @AngriestPat
[2:25:18] <startstoprepeat> huh, definitely doesn't feel that way
[2:26:13] <+D00msDayDan> arc
[2:26:16] <+Pyroclase> I wanna say it's arc?

[2:28:28] <%Ninestempest> ARC LEGS
[2:28:39] <+Javaa01> You definitely don't have it

[2:28:47] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat arc legs
[2:28:50] <+Javaa01> Grind more weapon parts
[2:28:54] <%TaifuDragon> @AngriestPat there's also ammo finder on arc helmet
[2:28:57] <%kewlmyc> Stop making your teem worse
[2:29:00] <+Pyroclase> there is not, but they're adding general ammo finders later
[2:29:10] <%Ninestempest> they're adding them in an upcoming patch
[2:29:13] <Qwertoqwerto> Not yet
[2:29:15] <+Pyroclase> They just announced it in TWAB
[2:29:17] <+GreenCMD> No, bungie blog post today says they're coming tho.

[2:30:13] <chambatron> X to revive? is he palying on xbox?
[2:30:19] <%SpcOpsBear> PC with controller
[2:30:23] <chambatron> Ok
[2:30:24] <%VirtuaRailith> virtua88Horfo
[2:30:41] <+Javaa01> Also, big cursed
[2:30:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> PC with controller is the most viable way to play with controller on PC
[2:30:50] <IminyourBase> why put yourself at a disadvantage tho?
[2:30:52] <WhereIsWill> feelsgoodman
[2:30:54] <+Dayube> @angriestpat Will you consider playing Nioh on stream or maybe the nioh 2 open beta on Nov 1?
[2:31:02] <@StridentSong> @angriestpat Hoo boy you are dropping frames like crazy
[2:31:22] <zv1neda> o
[2:31:23] <%PauliusMaximus> it was only for like 1 second
[2:31:30] <DavidSanChan> noob not using a flightstick/steering wheel combo
[2:31:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Mouse and Keyboard was awkward for me cause I played on PS4 first.
[2:31:39] <%TomDanksEGOT> Bungie FPSs tend to feel better on controller since they primarily developed for consoles
[2:31:42] <@StridentSong> It's more then one second. Twitch said he's dropped 2016 frames so far
[2:31:42] <WhereIsWill> just refreshed the stream cuz I thought the frames were just me lol
[2:31:46] <%ShockzNDrawe> his frames aren't the only thing thats dropping
[2:31:48] <segbas2004> nah
[2:31:50] <+Javaa01> Nah, it was the guy with the Scout
[2:31:54] <startstoprepeat> you, in fact, did not kill that fucker
[2:31:56] <%dekkitout> Drifter would beg to differ
[2:31:59] <%rumtumtugnutz> @DavidSanChan I use two steering wheels. Flightstick and Steering Wheel is for nerds
[2:32:00] <@lewdskeletor13> Stolen valor
[2:32:02] <chambatron> I honestly dislike playing with a mouse and that's why I only play on console. I know PC is better and you can play with a controller but whatevs
[2:32:35] <%Ninestempest> lol 46
[2:32:39] <%rumtumtugnutz> I HATE jeyboard and mouse. I would 100% rather use a controller for most games.
[2:32:40] <WhereIsWill> there are ppl out there who actually prefer dark souls on mouse an keyboard WutFace
[2:32:51] <%SpcOpsBear> those people are wrong
[2:32:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> Those people are touched in the brains
[2:32:55] <+Pyroclase> Man, how does pat have so much more progress than me? I don't even have a job....
[2:33:00] <%ShockzNDrawe> @AngriestPat Nah son
[2:33:11] <+armor_kuma> those people are not people they are animals
[2:33:13] <%dekkitout> He finished the road to Chappy?
[2:33:18] <raveous> keyboard and mouse are only better for shooters and RTS games, and everything else controller is infinitely better
[2:33:44] <$Timesteel> I earned chaperone completely passively lol
[2:33:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> RTS games are usually terrible on controller for true
[2:33:52] <IminyourBase> is it her smile?
[2:34:01] <%radda343> leave Amanda alone she's trying her best
[2:34:04] <%peenlordsupreme> peenlordsupreme subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:34:06] <+Javaa01> It's almost like the entire genre was never designed for controllers
[2:34:06] <startstoprepeat> she'll probably have a bunch of masks again soon
[2:34:06] <+armor_kuma> Driving with Mouse and Keyboard is just, its just so awful
[2:34:09] <soullesskin> Can anyone confirm if iron banner bounties refresh every day this season?
[2:34:11] <WhereIsWill> RTS on pad LUL
[2:34:12] <chambatron> Titans playing with shorguns on PVP is like the jocks of every fraternity
[2:34:14] <%dekkitout> Amanda's got other things going on...she's a great pilot, a mechanic, a widower...
[2:34:29] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat That weapon is AMAZING in comp IF you can aim
[2:34:45] <%Chichen> chicheGUN GUN
[2:34:45] <%dekkitout> That's the good one
[2:34:45] <+D00msDayDan> nice, you have the p2w ornament because barrel length matters for shotguns
[2:34:46] <startstoprepeat> that weapon cosmetic increases the range because destiny is dumb
[2:34:48] <%rainwater739> @dekkitout The correct term is 'single'
[2:34:51] <Ion_Laser> That's a pretty GUN
[2:34:51] <WhereIsWill> oooh
[2:34:56] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat 2shot body, 1 shot head at INCREDIBLE range
[2:34:57] <$Timesteel> panama ravine actually gives it more range
[2:34:57] <valriot> "Shotgun"
[2:35:01] <%Quigsies> What perks it got?
[2:35:07] <thehashslingingslashers> sends angry rounds hard and fast
[2:35:11] <+Pyroclase> Yup, that orament gives it a longer range because it is physically longer. Destinby is amazing.
[2:35:14] <WhereIsWill> pat taking it all the way to the top!
[2:35:22] <+armor_kuma> Seems op
[2:35:24] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> and it gets more range and damage
[2:35:26] <%dekkitout> Chaperone is an instrument of death that'll make tinbits from your foes' heads
[2:35:28] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Unless Bungie patched it, That ornament actually slightly increases the Chaperon's range too.
[2:35:41] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> pair it with a Spectral Blades Hunter and it is borderline OP
[2:35:48] <+Pyroclase> look at this man not using DIM
[2:35:49] <Qwertoqwerto> Like a 20th of a meter of extra range, it’s negligible
[2:35:51] <%GarbageNirvana> I do like a good slug
[2:35:53] <valriot> You can headshot kill from like 20m or something dumb
[2:36:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> For some reason I have a sniper rifle equpped, even though it is a bad Sniper. I just haven't changed it out cause I almost never change off my rifle in solo cause my rifle is badass.
[2:36:06] <%dekkitout> Yeyeye, get mappy with the Chappy
[2:36:10] <chambatron> You can one shot people from a bit further away than most shorguns if you land a headshot
[2:36:31] <+TheSkeep> i can't belive i have over three times as much bank space taken up then pat, how are my brain worms worse
[2:36:35] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat That thing can 1 shot headshot at like double melee range
[2:36:41] <+D00msDayDan> south african shotgun
[2:36:47] <Roz_Lynd> if i wind up in a fight against you i'm not fighting
[2:36:52] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> The thing about the Chaperone is that you're probably not going to get a second shot if you miss your first
[2:36:57] <+D00msDayDan> also how is pat missing every single one of these comments about barrel length
[2:37:02] <$realm_forge> You’re gonna love the range
[2:37:08] <+armor_kuma> The gimmick is its op
[2:37:14] <ScreamLord> And sometimes that's all you need an Exotic to be
[2:37:21] <DavidSanChan> barrel elngth hehe
[2:37:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AngriestPat Is it like that bullshit Mozambique shotgun I used to get all the time in Apex?
[2:37:26] <valriot> Get that length, barrel girth
[2:37:27] <$realm_forge> And you reload like Arnold in T2
[2:37:28] <%Chichen> the FANCY EVIL
[2:37:32] <Mad_Morpho> evil
[2:37:34] <IminyourBase> size queen
[2:37:34] <%mintyrobo> so what I'm hearing is this thing is anti-OEM
[2:37:35] <%logoth_> Its THICK and BLACK
[2:37:35] <chambatron> It's an all or nothing shotgun either you kill on the shot or you might not have a chance to shoot a second one
[2:37:46] <%dekkitout> The Polaris Lance's barrel length is even funnier with an ornament
[2:37:48] <blackbookalpha> wait this isn't Indivisible
[2:37:51] <$realm_forge> DAT RANGE
[2:37:52] <valriot> SUROS poggers
[2:38:00] <%legendfather_of_giants> @rumtumtugnutz idk, but it shoots one single bullet that does like trwice as much damage as it should if you headshot
[2:38:08] <%TaifuDragon> Wish-Ender is the only kinetic exotic I use
[2:38:11] <%TaifuDragon> Because I am a bastard
[2:38:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Evil is the superior version because it actually looks like it would be possible to use.
[2:38:14] <%Quigsies> one eyed monster
[2:38:14] <Roz_Lynd> oem garbage
[2:38:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> @legendfather_of_giants Neat.
[2:38:26] <%dekkitout> It kills so hard, it makes people uninstall their game
[2:38:26] <+D00msDayDan> btw, use chaperone with attunement of sky dawnblade for icarus grip
[2:38:26] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @TaifuDragon I love using bows in pvp, they're my most used, but thats brave
[2:38:28] <Roz_Lynd> "unflinching X"
[2:38:35] <valriot> Get a Mindbenders Ambition, that thing just works
[2:38:40] <%TaifuDragon> @The_Lady_Alustriel it has wallhacks which means it's scum in Survival
[2:38:50] <%TaifuDragon> Peek corner, catch arrow in face
[2:39:08] <$The_Lady_Alustriel> @TaifuDragon yeah I definitely see the benefit, but it's already a struggle to get more than one arrow off somtimes lol
[2:39:10] <%dekkitout> That's why I love Le Monarch in pvp Jebaited
[2:39:12] <valriot> Worst map for shotguns LUL LUL
[2:39:18] <%SpcOpsBear> Hey, wanna hear a joke?
[2:39:20] <%SpcOpsBear> The Stranger's Rifle.
[2:39:26] <foreverN2dust> Was this map in D1?
[2:39:30] <+D00msDayDan> good start
[2:39:31] <Qwertoqwerto> No
[2:39:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> @SpcOpsBear stop it
[2:40:03] <Ion_Laser> @SpcOpsBear :D
[2:40:11] <Notingles> @Notingles is new here. Say hello! SeemsGood
[2:40:13] <%MalekDracarus> @forevern2dust Yes
[2:40:14] <ScreamLord> Aimed a little too high
[2:40:18] <valriot> fucking Inaugural address people in year 3
[2:40:18] <%logoth_> I dont know how you can play pvp with a controller
[2:40:20] <+D00msDayDan> remember, despite firing a slug chaperone still has shotgun range
[2:40:25] <WhereIsWill> miss and it's OVER lol
[2:40:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Chappy is hard to use, but it feels GOOD when you hit
[2:40:38] <IminyourBase> 2 bodyshots > 1 missed headshot
[2:40:57] <%dekkitout> Chappy takes time- and clueless enemies...
[2:41:04] <ScreamLord> Stream is chugging it
[2:41:12] <WhereIsWill> I'm all about this shotty

[2:46:20] <chambatron> Jotunn is cancer
[2:46:20] <startstoprepeat> gunnora's is the one that can get opening shot, right?
[2:46:28] <valriot> Jotunn ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[2:46:54] <ScreamLord> @chambatron It was MUCH worse before they nerfed the tracking
[2:47:08] <%MalekDracarus> What shotguns drop with one two punch most consistently?
[2:47:20] <+jyeowa> pat made that successful kill streak look very unexciting somehow
[2:47:29] <StarvingPenguinGod> LUL
[2:47:30] <valriot> Man, Crown is such a good helmet but it looks like shit
[2:47:38] <Qwertoqwerto> Crown of Sorrows shotty
[2:47:39] <chambatron> @ScreamLord I didn't know they actually nerfed it but I'm glad
[2:47:49] <+MrTickleTrunk> That was very OK
[2:48:00] <WhereIsWill> ggs
[2:48:03] <Greywyn00> is pat only doing pvp tonight?
[2:48:03] <%MachigattaLT> the TTK on this game has always seemed way too low for me
[2:48:04] <%Chichen> mothma3Moffchamp
[2:48:14] <WhereIsWill> game running better btws idk why
[2:48:25] <ScreamLord> @chambatron It damn near used to do U Turns when it first dropped
[2:48:25] <%dekkitout> Jotunn had an issue where on higher frame rates it's tick damage would increase
[2:48:30] <@StridentSong> You're dropping frames again
[2:48:36] <%Swampykins> mothma3Moffchamp
[2:48:38] <WhereIsWill> LUL
[2:48:45] <%Chichen> Yep. I saw it too
[2:48:53] <+PerrinIsDead> Elmo is at 24fps
[2:48:54] <@StridentSong> Pat, it's not your graphics
[2:48:55] <%dekkitout> It's almost the same reason why 1k Voices got bopped on pc
[2:48:56] <%Ninestempest> it's probably twitch
[2:48:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> I love how in this game warlocks looks like they just super raided a thrift store.
[2:48:57] <@StridentSong> Switch twitch servers
[2:49:06] <ScreamLord> Probably
[2:49:08] <chambatron> Not dropping frames for me on 1080p60
[2:49:11] <@StridentSong> No, because it's happening during matches
[2:49:15] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Just set it to 800x600 and run it windowed
[2:49:28] <%alcors_wisdom> you can but you need a third party app
[2:49:46] <WhereIsWill> u can't iirc
[2:49:59] <@StridentSong> You have to do it through OBS, though it'll require you to reset the stream though
[2:50:07] <%Chichen> oof yah big frame drops
