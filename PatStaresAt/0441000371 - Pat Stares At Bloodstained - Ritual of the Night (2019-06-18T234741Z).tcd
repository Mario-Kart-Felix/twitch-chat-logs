[0:10:25] <%Hasmeister96> @spec7re IKR. It just appeared with no fanfare or anything

[0:10:40] <%CerberusDriver> Will Bloodstained make me cry like an anime fan on prom night?
[0:10:43] <$sylphyyyy> @buttku good!!! i hope the day stays good for you
[0:10:47] <Futurecity10> Since raiding is the endgame of the game

[0:22:24] <TwinBat> David Hayter is in the game but this isn't him

[0:55:08] <%Niney_Who> And the eyes become many potatoes
[0:55:10] <eldritchart> you cut up the potato and pury it. potatoes do have seeds tho
[0:55:11] <filialpails> potatoes have eyes on the outside
[0:55:24] <$Order_of_Mystery> Stick potato in ground, wait, more potato

[2:50:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pride500 Techniques are only for a few weapons, but Mastering them unlocks them for the whole weapon family. Getting Passive Shards to Rank 9 through Alchemy makes it so you don't have to equip them. Isn't that great? Always wanted to have all of Soma's Passive Souls at the same time.

[3:35:59] <%AstroFalcon09> @Geno4344 ok but who does the art
[3:35:59] <@StridentSong> It's a low chance drop
[3:36:00] <%Niney_Who> 4%
[3:36:07] <%king_wragles> Like if the screen didn't flash it'd be totally fine
[3:36:08] <%AstroFalcon09> @Geno4344 since gacha is 90% art
[3:36:08] <OldManDeckardCain> pair up that sword with sword expertise and you get fakin DPS for days

[3:41:13] <majindusto> Symphony is fantastic
[3:41:14] <+dougrayman> he got another one?

[3:41:38] <+Slice_of_Kris> can you turn into a dog or cat tho?
[3:41:38] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Right in the pits.
[3:41:39] <%Mekhet09> Personally I think the DS games are the best.
[3:41:40] <starotter70> Pat's gonna stain your castle
[3:41:40] <%Toynota10> How you like compared to Hollow Knight?
[3:41:41] <%AstroFalcon09> It's castlevania for girls
[3:41:43] <%hrudzie_1> hrudzie_1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[3:41:43] <Mashn2> Is it better than hollow knight?!?!
[3:41:44] <%Remery_> Castlevania with Waifu Dress up? I'm in
[3:41:44] <cellarspook> when do the loot boxes come into play
[3:41:46] <%AstroFalcon09> not even gonna lie

[3:42:06] <krymzen5> the free dlcs for this sound super cool
[3:42:07] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Castlestainia
[3:42:09] <Finakala> Map completion is absolutely important in Metroidvania
[3:42:09] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> The hoes mad notifcation synced to that music
[3:42:10] <roofkie> @AngriestPat was that because of your goblins?
[3:42:10] <$Valdorick> 10/10, Map complete
[3:42:11] <hntronium> the ceiling tho
[3:42:11] <%spiritofmojave> your goblins are your limiters
[3:42:12] <haitakaa> commendable

[3:42:35] <circular7> Pat will kill them all!
[3:42:36] <%Kilagn> Curse of Darkness is where Hector and Isaac come from in the Castevania show but are very different @AngriestPat
[3:42:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> Shawn? Wait, when did I die?
[3:42:41] <$8BitDsx> @AngriestPat you can select multiple quests by pressing "X", using an Xbox controller.
[3:42:43] <anuchallengertwitch> Kill them to death!
[3:42:44] <%Skrypto> is this a console exclusive or can I get it on Steam?
[3:42:51] <Papafleish> I just want to play galaga
[3:42:54] <%AstroFalcon09> it's on both
[3:42:55] <%spiritofmojave> Granny says KILL THEM ALL 1857
[3:42:57] <$Dakuu75> the character portrait at the top left reminds me of the chick from the anime "Overlord"
[3:42:58] <%Skrypto> neat
[3:42:58] <haitakaa> Hollow Knight is a pure metroid clone
[3:43:02] <haitakaa> well not clone
[3:43:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Hollowknight is its own thing now
[3:43:06] <%AstroFalcon09> you can get it on everything even the switch
[3:43:06] <haitakaa> but no levels and stats
[3:43:12] <%Niney_Who> Still thinkin' bout them fries
[3:43:13] <Finakala> Hollow Knight is unfairly well refined
[3:43:14] <$cureneckbeard> If it's in England why are you buying things in gold instead of shillings
[3:43:15] <%PinkSuprende> Pat your farm box is full, go put down some catalysts
[3:43:17] <$hatesdps> do the 8 bit and 16 bit coins do what i think they do?
[3:43:22] <circular7> hollow Knight better than dmc5, pat said it not me Kappa
[3:43:22] <ExpressNode> I just bought Hollow Knight on my Switch and I love it
[3:43:27] <%AstroFalcon09> maybe not the dreamcast or gameboy advance
[3:43:28] <%hrudzie_1> how much?
[3:43:28] <+Brewstamasta> Anyone know how the switch port runs?
[3:43:30] <FalseEyeD> Steam Xbox PS4 Switch
[3:43:30] <+ScatFace> hollow knight is more metroid than SOTN
[3:43:31] <%Ninestempest> surprisingly this game is NOT a shitty epic exclusive
[3:43:32] <$cureneckbeard> Can I get it at the Epic Store?
[3:43:34] <%Ninestempest> it is on PC
[3:43:36] <worldbrand> you trade the -bit coins for powerful special weapons
[3:43:37] <Kalcom> I can't belive they just give you this at early game
[3:43:37] <%Ninestempest> on Steam
[3:43:38] <%Skrypto> LUL
[3:43:38] <%anticrust> What if I think it looks bad...
[3:43:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> NO it is an epic store exlusive....its on steam for like 30
[3:43:39] <%AstroFalcon09> @cureneckbeard no LUL
[3:43:40] <+ScatFace> but it doesn't control like a metroid
[3:43:41] <haitakaa> Silksong will be doop
[3:43:42] <+Slice_of_Kris> but can you get it on epic game store am i right chat
[3:43:42] <starotter70> @hrudzie_1 Like 40$
[3:43:42] <%Spydurman> Hey Pat I'm curious if Hollow Knight is the best Metroidvania, what's the best survival horror game? RE2?
[3:43:43] <@lewdskeletor13> I’ll only buy it on Epic
[3:43:43] <%NWR_James> Like a big rubber fist?
[3:43:44] <%Remery_> for fisting?
[3:43:46] <%hrudzie_1> how much in CAD on steam?
[3:43:46] <worldbrand> they're probably kickstarter backer weapons but i'm not sure
[3:43:47] <Caidezes> Giant hands are really useful.
[3:43:47] <+jbaker009> this game will probably end up being crack for me just like am2r and dead cells
[3:43:47] <circular7> baby hands pat
[3:43:48] <@commanderclaw> Yeah you want bigger hands, but what about the game?
[3:43:48] <%anticrust> Like the models and environment
[3:43:56] <cellarspook> try giant hand but hole
[3:43:57] <circular7> baby arm bovin
[3:43:59] <%AstroFalcon09> it looks fine
[3:43:59] <Mashn2> Romantic giant hand even??
[3:44:02] <FalseEyeD> Love the Level Up effect
[3:44:06] <%TheMilhouseExperience> Then you would have to fight a smelly smash player though.
[3:44:11] <Finakala> I bought Dead Cells the other day but haven't played it yet, too much FFXIV and Sekiro to play first
[3:44:12] <%hrudzie_1> @starotter70 thx
[3:44:13] <%anticrust> It would look better in the sprite style its trying to evoke
[3:44:14] <%TheWinged7> then whyd you toss the romantic rubber fists pat?

[3:45:10] <Saltmeisterr> AAAAAAAH
[3:45:10] <Onillius> @AngriestPat ( I don't know if you missed the latter post so here ) but this game was made by Koji Igarashi the guy who made SOTN, Aria and dawn of Sarrow and order of Ecclesia so he's up there with kojima if you ask me
[3:45:11] <TheLakinessMonster> Was it a backer reward to do the voice acting for some monsters?
[3:45:15] <%AstroFalcon09> this game is obviously inspired a little by bloodborne which is fine
[3:45:20] <Mashn2> That sword just screamed

[4:18:39] <cellarspook> playing the piano unlocks the michiru yamane skin
[4:18:40] <$RubberFistFight> @StEmlosWater I mean that it sounds absolutely nothing like moonlight sonata besides being played on a piano.

[4:18:48] <Nina96> oh no
[4:18:50] <haitakaa> the fairy will sing if you get her
[4:18:52] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> How's the game so far? Comparable quality to old Igavanias?
[4:18:53] <abakkus> the devs didn't have to add the ability to play a random piano but they did. they did that for us.

[4:23:00] <%freightl0rd> should i buy bloodstained or shadowbringers? i havent finished goddamn stormblood yet and i have terrible awful FOMO
[4:23:01] <+Promessa_EX> I think the designs are great but the way they are rendered is less great
[4:23:12] <%StEmlosWater> @Cuon_Alpinus What do you mean? Animation looks good to me
[4:23:15] <FalseEyeD> It is acceptable Kickstarter jank
[4:23:17] <haitakaa> the models are a bit too shiny imo
[4:23:18] <%Mekhet09> I hope pat switchs weapons it sucks.
[4:23:22] <doodledumps> So i've never played a Castlevania game but i'd love to get into them. Where should i start? I know a lot of people say Symphony of the Night is super good but isn't that like the 5th game?
[4:23:30] <%Ascethetic> @cuon_alpinus its basically a Castlevania game, how do you expect it to animate?
[4:23:34] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> SILVER CHARIOT is GOING BERSERK
[4:23:35] <cellarspook> lovingly made artisanal jank
[4:23:39] <%freightl0rd> @SwindlerOfProgress dude its killing me to say this because that game looks fucking cool for all the reasons i love castlevania but the actual in game art and shit looks like a shitty 360 indie game
[4:23:42] <+BurkeBigsby> ew, english.

[4:24:13] <+kimonochrono> i think youre giving way too much credit to 360 indie games
[4:24:18] <%StEmlosWater> @freightl0rd You have forgotten what XBLA Indie looked like if you think that
[4:24:18] <FFFan80> ....I didn't know chaining the kicks did that. fuuuuuuuuck
[4:24:22] <doodledumps> @FalseEyeD That's when all the stats and item switching was put in right?

[4:25:05] <SirBrawler18> How is it Pat, early response I hear is pretty positive
[4:25:06] <%CalebHatesGames> @doodledumps Symphony is where this style of Castlevania originated, so you're fine.
[4:25:06] <SwindlerOfProgress> @freightl0rd I'm right there with you. The backgrounds don't bother me, but the enemies and characters, I really don't like. I can probably kind of get used to it eventually, but not enough to like it.
[4:25:08] <%freightl0rd> but the moves also look SO FUCKING COOL
[4:25:10] <Djinnazz> Zobaz confirmed.
