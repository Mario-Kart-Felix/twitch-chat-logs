[0:08:49] <%SilvaChariot0133> those are worth more
[0:08:50] <cosmicgoatee> There's being nice to devs and playing keys cause it benefits both parties and there's clearly selling out like those chinese mobile games

[0:14:46] <%floralkami> @sllypper yes, he's been praising this all week
[0:14:49] <%walternatorz> you wouldn't pirate a subscription
[0:14:54] <Sllypper> @Crushter A fucking lot. Way way too much
[0:14:54] <heart_ablaze> He is cool tho

[0:15:13] <%starotter70> The undertale character?
[0:15:14] <claivian> i have found the file percentage to be real bullshit in blasphemous made it to like area 3
[0:15:15] <%primax104> He is a your blasphemous MC acting like batman
[0:15:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> Azrael Abyss works at Cinnabun
[0:15:18] <cosmicgoatee> Basically, hes a good goat lad
[0:15:18] <Lmsd944> big yikes for the canadian prime minister
[0:15:21] <%floralkami> He's Edgelord Batman
[0:15:24] <worldbrand> He'll only take the ham
[0:15:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Azrael was Batman for awhile after a Bane broke Bruce’s back, but went nuts
[0:15:31] <suikudo> @AngriestPat I just want you to know if i could pirate a subscription to your channel i would do it and sleep like an elmo

[0:15:40] <+xXichibanballer> Mr.Popo is our prime minister now
[0:15:42] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat Are you interested in the GRR Martin/Dark Souls game?
[0:15:43] <%d00msdaydan> oh SHIT
[0:15:43] <marvel877> Knight's good, but its definitely the weakest Arkham game, including Origins.
[0:15:45] <%Ranryu692> this never ends well
[0:15:47] <kindashagg> Metal O'Clock
[0:15:48] <jellssssss20> So quick!

[0:16:21] <Sparty9112> have you confessed your sins today, Pat?
[0:16:21] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I didn't realize you could get different looks for your player character
[0:16:22] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Different audio levels... actually this is good.
[0:16:23] <Lmsd944> @floralkami pictures of him in black face
[0:16:24] <%WheatlyXT> Sounds good
[0:16:25] <suikudo> no it was good
[0:16:26] <Ominnous> we did it
[0:16:31] <TomDanksEGOT> during the podcast Wols mentioned a gif of Clone Trooper firing guns from a cliff when talking about Sakuga, anyone know what anime the scene was from?
[0:16:31] <+BoboDaHobo> @angriestpat I'm leaving this here so I can ask you to go back and read it a few weeks from now
[0:16:35] <OswaldTheDog> no he’s a lil goat dude
[0:16:35] <%Nope80808> WHEEL AND DEAL
[0:16:35] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A few sound FX seem muted, but actual battle is at a good level.
[0:16:35] <Ominnous> now we can say bitch again
[0:16:36] <%averyoddjew> did you get the 3 humiliations?
[0:16:43] <kindashagg> Christ you're far in
[0:16:46] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat hey Pat, I just wanted to say last stream sorry if I felt backseaty or handholdy I like this game a lot so I was just trying to alleviate some of the wanderlust
[0:16:46] <%floralkami> @lmsd944 @lmsd944 OH BOIII
[0:16:48] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat game sound is fine to me
[0:16:49] <Mendin> He has one Mask
[0:16:52] <ShichiNoBushi> There are bone-wheel skeletons somewhere in those guys.
[0:16:57] <BlacSoul> i hate his stupid pointy hat
[0:16:59] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Yea this is close to perfect.
[0:17:01] <Coystick> Full LP
[0:17:05] <%starotter70> @TomDanksEGOT I wanna say he was talking about the Clone Wars cartoon
[0:17:07] <cureneckbeard> Put luck to 50
[0:17:08] <%kiiiirsten> !uptime
[0:17:09] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 17m 10s.
[0:17:15] <%Laecerelius> Only real hiccup with a boss was the giant skele-pope and even then it wasn't that bad
[0:17:17] <%dukenux> we finishing Deus Souls tonight?
[0:17:19] <AzureHawk_Streams> Welp, time to start hunting that shiny Celebi!
[0:17:20] <%MyNameIsRasus> catholic lucky ted
[0:17:26] <%kiiiirsten> wtf 17 minutes and Pat is playing da game???
[0:17:28] <%MyNameIsRasus> aka jesus
[0:17:29] <Mendin> Oh, Pat, remember the sewer shit
[0:17:29] <%indig0bird> Hey, apparently someone gave me an eyeball while I took a rest from Twitch!
[0:17:31] <%floralkami> PAT, IS CANADA BLACKFACE BOIS NOW? Y'ALL MAKING NOIZE??? @angriestpat
[0:17:32] <%RantingRavager> Roman Catholic Ted
[0:17:33] <%king_wragles> What's the nail do?
[0:17:44] <%indig0bird> Thanks and I'm sorry for being this callous
[0:17:50] <%Crushter> @king_wragles removes water weight
[0:17:52] <ShichiNoBushi> St. Ted
[0:17:53] <%FrostMass22> @king_wragles Makes it so mud doesn't hinder you
[0:17:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Same with me. I swear I heard you ask for help with the rosary last night. Wanted to give you the right info and copy-pasted what I found to not mislead you.
[0:17:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat and Crushter sittin in a tree, drinkin maple syrup hee hee hee
[0:18:00] <Ominnous> @averyoddjew he has done the 3 humiliations and beat a boss called Malquiedas
[0:18:00] <%king_wragles> @Crushter ya I just noticed that actually
[0:18:07] <TomDanksEGOT> #starotter70 cool that's what I was thinking but not totally sure
[0:18:12] <BlacSoul> ddi pat ever do Deaths Gambit?
[0:18:17] <+jetjagger222> melquiades is fuckin' sick
[0:18:19] <%pectusumbra> ooooo, fancy new outfit. Alright, gotta bounce out, watching stuff in order and all. have fun all!
[0:18:21] <@lewdskeletor13> This game makes me feel sinful
[0:18:26] <%FrostMass22> I have precognition when it comes to things I already know
[0:18:27] <%averyoddjew> @Ominnous the one being held up by arms?
[0:18:30] <%starotter70> "Uh oh, I looked at chat"
[0:18:33] <Ominnous> @averyoddjew ye
[0:18:39] <Mendin> Good. Feel sinful. Pray to the Miracle for redemption and punishment for your guilt
[0:18:41] <claivian> kinda sucks you have to manually select the artifacts when it would sorta just be better to have them active all at once and be able to disable or activate them at will.
[0:18:48] <Ominnous> ended it shortly after that boss
[0:18:50] <%averyoddjew> dam he passed me
[0:18:50] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat lots of sewer stuff is available now with the nail
[0:18:51] <rainwater739> Can someone fill me in on the basic plot of this game. I missed the last few streams
[0:18:58] <TomDanksEGOT> @starotter70 Cool that's what I was thinking, Thx
[0:19:00] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Is chat as wrong about this game as consistently it was for Contol?
[0:19:05] <%kiiiirsten> is this.....anor londo?
[0:19:09] <%dukenux> nah
[0:19:10] <%Laecerelius> Yeah only being able to have three set at a time is pretty lame
[0:19:11] <%FrostMass22> @claivian It's probably an arbitrary rule to make it so you can miss stuff
[0:19:12] <jellssssss20> Any tips for Bayonetta 2? I just got it for the switch
[0:19:14] <%starotter70> @TomDanksEGOT Np, could still be wrong
[0:19:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You seem like you're in a great mood tonight, man. :) Pre-stream funsies?
[0:19:19] <Ominnous> @averyoddjew oh and he did a jump puzzle dodging a giant swinging something...?
[0:19:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> @claivian true
[0:19:26] <%dukenux> this doesn't have as much stuff to be wrong about as Control.
[0:19:30] <Mendin> big charm slots
[0:19:31] <%kiiiirsten> wow what a weird question to ask someone
[0:19:40] <%moogleboy1984> Slide Cooldown is baller
[0:19:45] <%Crushter> I feel like the relics were at some point big buff items that they wanted a hard limit on @AngriestPat
[0:19:50] <GiygasDrillBreak> the Mea Culpa should have the 3-slots, while the relics stay active like metroid upgrades
[0:19:50] <%FrostMass22> Either Pat got further than he thought or he was better at finding secrets than I was in my first playthrough
[0:19:50] <Pinkaminks> You probably want the thorned symbol, no contact damage is huge for bosses
[0:19:52] <%crimsonharvest> instant fall recovery not good?
[0:19:57] <cosmicgoatee> Same feeling after all charms in hollow knight
[0:20:02] <%gunzerkingdunce> Wait how much has he streamed this? and how far has he gotten?
[0:20:05] <TomDanksEGOT> Im super psyched ot see the full ending, I've seen the bad one but it looks like pat may 100% this mf'er
[0:20:12] <%kiiiirsten> My heart rate went up when I saw there is a designated LORE BUTTON
[0:20:12] <%Crushter> he's over half @gunzerkingdunce
[0:20:16] <%floralkami> @rainwater739 the Miracle happened and everyone got punished so hard they each became a metal album cover. this guy is trying to stop the shit, hence the Blasphemy.
[0:20:18] <cosmicgoatee> Big slots Kreygasm
[0:20:19] <AzureHawk_Streams> How was the podcast this week? I missed it.
[0:20:19] <Coystick> I like the heavy slam
[0:20:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @gunzerkingdunce Something like 12 hours.
[0:20:29] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's very few times fall recovery is a hindrance
[0:20:36] <%gunzerkingdunce> @crushter didn't he only start yesterday?
[0:20:42] <Coystick> Shit feeling weighty is important to me
[0:20:47] <kindashagg> I may have to dip out because you're way ahead of me, but enjoy the game dude
[0:20:50] <%FrostMass22> @gunzerkingdunce Day before yesterday
[0:20:50] <%dukenux> that;s a lotta modifiers
[0:20:51] <%floralkami> @gunzerkingdunce two streams ago
[0:20:53] <%Crushter> @gunzerkingdunce no he did an earlier one
[0:20:56] <ShichiNoBushi> Touch tips
[0:20:57] <%gunzerkingdunce> got it, ty
[0:20:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger Sup d00d
[0:20:59] <GiygasDrillBreak> day before yesterday, but yesterday he did ALOT
[0:20:59] <%CappuccinoGuil> so this is a metroidvania, eh?
[0:21:02] <%starotter70> ooooooh
[0:21:05] <%Laecerelius> so much stuff to do!
[0:21:06] <%dukenux> OOH PogChamp
[0:21:08] <claivian> charge attacking is also virtually useless since you have to stand still while using it and cant move around while charging since that would make it actually usable.
[0:21:09] <%moogleboy1984> Are you ready to deliver a fragile flower?
[0:21:13] <joaodmc> how do you get that skin??
[0:21:22] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat I finished the speed run after your stream session last night so now I'm 100% on both the game and Steam
[0:21:23] <Ultimatefool> Is this Hollow Knight 2.0
[0:21:23] <GiygasDrillBreak> charge has limited use, true
[0:21:26] <%starotter70> @joaodmc Deluxe Edition I think
[0:21:27] <Dementedpenguin> Don't jinx it.
[0:21:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Me, and the sky. How about you?
[0:21:30] <%kiiiirsten> IS this on the switch
[0:21:30] <cosmicgoatee> My Brinstar senses are off the charts
[0:21:37] <Vigonept> I enjoy pat the most when he goes " OH OOH OH" and gets excited about the game hes playing.
[0:21:38] <Mendin> It is on the switch

[0:26:42] <atravelbee> @pat what did you think of the Bab and Worm boss
[0:26:47] <3xgilly> said no one ever
[0:26:47] <pennykettle_> bitch is stronger than fucko because bitch is 1 syllable that you can hold
[0:26:49] <IndoorSitup> Was just having a discussion on the CSB discord on the lore behind different religions and mythologies and how fucking dumb it all is but in a good way.
[0:26:49] <%kiiiirsten> Kappa
[0:26:50] <Mendin> Hasnt gotten to it yet
[0:26:50] <tigerspath> Hi Pat. Hi chat.

[0:27:04] <%InugamiTheHound> big dick pat!! Play some fallout 4!!
[0:27:05] <%Thalchampz> just say no, pat
[0:27:06] <%Calek> @miguelrod777 if you're playing 5e don't worry about keeping people topped up, damage is huge in 5e better to do damage and then pop people back up when they go down
[0:27:06] <3xgilly> read the room bro
[0:27:06] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat you spent all the deaths from her normally on that platforming segment with the ghosts and worm attacks
[0:27:08] <Coystick> Fuck off Randy
[0:27:08] <Ultimatefool> RANDOLPH NO
[0:27:08] <beetbo2> No BL3
[0:27:08] <GiygasDrillBreak> RANDY NOOOO
[0:27:09] <+chaumiester> Pat boycott BL3
[0:27:12] <suikudo> fuck bitchford and fuck BL3
[0:27:14] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Play it so you can be mad at Ava the whole time
[0:27:14] <pennykettle_> I will pay extra for BL3 if it means Randy gets none of it
[0:27:16] <%dukenux> It's okay to say "no", Pat
[0:27:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Storytime with Pat?
[0:27:16] <Valdorick> I'm pretty sure BL3 is anti-pat bait at this point.
[0:27:19] <%moogleboy1984> I'm glad that EGS bought it, because it made me a patient gamer
[0:27:20] <ShichiNoBushi> *Ding Dong* It's hired goons!
[0:27:23] <MajesticDoogle> it's a really good game tho
[0:27:29] <%moogleboy1984> hopefully it'll be patched by the time it comes out
[0:27:30] <RogerPoore> @AngriestPat There's a billion games to play otherwise
[0:27:31] <%GarbageNirvana> BL3 is a great game that I wish was made by better people
[0:27:31] <Slim_Lipid> It isn'r really
[0:27:32] <jellssssss20> When’s the next boss, hurry up Kappa
[0:27:34] <+SamleyTimes> ???
[0:27:36] <awalbaru> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[0:27:36] <%Crushter> its written terribly too
[0:27:41] <+SamleyTimes> ahhh yeah
[0:27:42] <beetbo2> you summed it up very well
[0:27:43] <deviljhojho94> Dont forget the jokes
[0:27:47] <pennykettle_> the MEMES
[0:27:47] <Coystick> There's plenty of good games to support instead
[0:27:47] <%kiiiirsten> GOONS
[0:27:47] <jellssssss20> “It’s an okay game to...”*
[0:27:48] <beetbo2> "JOKES"
[0:27:50] <Ultimatefool> The 2K GOONS
[0:27:50] <AdmiralButtloaf> Randolfo Pitchfordo
[0:27:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> infinte memeworks
[0:27:53] <beetbo2> In BIG quotations
[0:27:55] <shevan123> stealing mone
[0:27:55] <+EmiinV> what happened with the voice actors rangel2Woah ?
[0:27:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> What happened with the "voice actor shit"?
[0:27:58] <Coystick> HIRED 2K GOONS
[0:28:00] <Crankthulhu> Just buy the game, install it, then refund it, you'll keep the game Kappa
[0:28:00] <atravelbee> It would have been a revolution IN 2014
[0:28:01] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat What sort of writing we talking about?
[0:28:03] <Aydarkzero> i saw some cutscenes they look like shit
[0:28:03] <+SamleyTimes> except for the game part
[0:28:05] <pennykettle_> Is that one guy still writing it? You know, that one guy?
[0:28:08] <claivian> @AngriestPat Do you know how to use air impulse it allows for a couple extra attacks in the air you can see the explanation in the gameplay tips
[0:28:08] <jellssssss20> It’s a good game to pirate..?
[0:28:09] <Slim_Lipid> "It's great except for every aspect about it" Yeah okay sure
[0:28:09] <Pinkaminks> They hired new voice actors and just didnt even ask the old VAs
[0:28:11] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> it's like captain planet except instead of stopping pollution it's trying to stop borderlands 3
[0:28:12] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[0:28:14] <%gunzerkingdunce> Fair enough
[0:28:16] <MajesticDoogle> the story is actually pretty good even if the humor isn't your cup of tea
[0:28:16] <deviljhojho94> if you removed every sentence and word from the game it would legit become a better experience
[0:28:17] <IndoorSitup> Don't forget about the 2K mafia sending goons to your house.
[0:28:19] <%logoth_> "Big Dock Energy"
[0:28:20] <%NeroInfinite> Randy basically being a shit to claptraps old VA
[0:28:20] <%Kiiper> No, Burch is in his cuckhole somewhere
[0:28:21] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat's got scruples yo.
[0:28:22] <deviljhojho94> Memelands

[0:28:30] <%Mrbaconator> i actually like meme central
[0:28:30] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> oh no
[0:28:31] <%Nope80808> Dated memes to the max
[0:28:31] <Aydarkzero> oh good
[0:28:33] <%nmaten> so random xd
[0:28:38] <ZE_Count> time to hoist the black flag!
[0:28:39] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat to the salt saint
[0:28:40] <Onmi_Khaos> Not even good memes too
[0:28:41] <Dementedpenguin> I've never played a Borderlands game, so all of this is going over my head.
[0:28:41] <GiygasDrillBreak> HEY MORTY I TURNED INTO BORDERLANDS, IM BORDERLANDS RIIIICK
[0:28:42] <AzureHawk_Streams> Hoist the colors, then?
[0:28:44] <Slim_Lipid> Kill Big Succ to get the Rick and Morty Shotgun
[0:28:45] <Coystick> Boomers slinging memes
[0:28:49] <heart_ablaze> The main villains of 3 are horrible
[0:28:49] <Mendin> Bless That Shit
[0:28:49] <Valdorick> "We disbanded our Australia branch because the jokes in Pre-Sequel weren't funny" - Company that would later make Boarderlands 3.
[0:28:49] <pennykettle_> I liked Jim's review that asked why he should hate the antagonists when every NPC is an asshole
[0:28:50] <MajesticDoogle> believe it or not, it is toned down from bl2
[0:28:50] <%SGrim> So, what if you embrace the shit? I can see the appeal.
[0:28:50] <sambws> How the fuck do you increase the meme level from BL2
[0:28:53] <%dukenux> I want Raiden to visit Gearbox HQ and End their Memes.
[0:28:54] <SourDoughRye> like doog
[0:28:55] <%GarbageNirvana> If I do another playthrough I plan on turning voices down and turning subtitles off
[0:28:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @faldin D:< So how big was the lawsuit / settlement after? Assholes...
[0:29:00] <MajesticDoogle> it's still... potty humor max though :(
[0:29:01] <%moogleboy1984> I ripped my hair out trying to remember where this room was
[0:29:01] <%Laecerelius> Off to Clemps to bless this shit!
[0:29:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @EmiinV The guy who first did claptrap did it for free while working on the game, when he asked for money to keep doing the voice, he shit on by the weirdo who runs that company.
[0:29:03] <%valriot> @angriestpat It's like eating a Chick-fil-a, big troubles bug zealot Christian beliefs, but thats some good fukin chicken
[0:29:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Far as I'm concerned it's gonna be a universe of mutes
[0:29:05] <awalbaru> I liked borderlands 3 but then i realized i never played
[0:29:07] <Crankthulhu> @Valdorick Is that true?!?
[0:29:07] <+mugwugsampoo> Borderlands combat is ResidentSleeper
[0:29:07] <RogerPoore> @AngriestPat Did you see the entire sidequest that's a Tommy Wiseu reference, including his voice?
[0:29:09] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat to the salt saint man
[0:29:10] <jellssssss20> Wasn’t it the Witcher dev that said “pirate this game if you can’t get it”? This should be everyone else saying “pirate this game if oh *need* to play it”
[0:29:14] <deviljhojho94> hmm i wonder tomatoMMM
[0:29:18] <%gunzerkingdunce> @sambws some of the guns say here comes dat boy
[0:29:19] <IndoorSitup> Can anyone give us a rundown on all the oudated internet memes that game references?
[0:29:27] <pennykettle_> jellssssss20 I think that was hotline miami devs with australia
[0:29:29] <%SilvaChariot0133> nice
[0:29:31] <%moogleboy1984> Diesel with the big boot
[0:29:32] <ZE_Count> Theres a Tommy Wiseu quest in borderlands 3?
[0:29:32] <%Nope80808> I wish they'd brought on the writers from Tales from the Borderlands to make the story while they focused on the gameplay.
[0:29:33] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[0:29:33] <Valdorick> @Crankthulhu Maybe not the jokes part, but they did disband their Aussy office because of poor sales.
[0:29:33] <GiygasDrillBreak> Pat if you pick up a useless item, there's only 1 person who can use it
[0:29:37] <Onmi_Khaos> So theres a bitcoin gun and the bitcoin gun has the description "One free blockchain with every reload" and the ability "Say cryptocurrency!"
[0:29:38] <Coystick> All of them
[0:29:40] <+RiceeFTW> @IndoorSitup use ALL the memes hggTom

[0:29:48] <worldbrand> there's a splatoon reference
[0:29:48] <%Crushter> oh yes
[0:29:48] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Find the big succ
[0:29:49] <%dukenux> Also, all the random humor aside, BL2 didn't really grip me as a game itself. its one of those that clicks only when you play with friends.
[0:29:50] <+SamleyTimes> 0/10
[0:29:50] <%genowyn> Randy posted cringe
[0:29:50] <deviljhojho94> And a The Big Succ joke

[0:29:54] <%Anime_Flux> do you need a high IQ to wield it?
[0:29:55] <Onmi_Khaos> And that's it, it doesn't do random damage that fluctuates every second.
[0:29:56] <heart_ablaze> The villains of 3 are GOD AWFUL
[0:29:57] <%dukenux> IM PICKLE DIIIIIICK
[0:29:59] <suikudo> DRM has been cracked already
[0:29:59] <Crankthulhu> @IndoorSitup I saw an NPC called Amber Lamps, based on the Badass Grandpa viral video that I'm pretty sure was stale when BL2 came out
[0:30:01] <%grayjammer> Oh

[0:30:01] <%solidousstream> theres pickle rick behind a car

[0:30:06] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> What about a BIG MOOD meme?
[0:30:06] <%dukenux> WUBBA BUBBA GLUB GLUB
[0:30:06] <Coystick> You think Randy knows he's vile or is he deaf to the truth?
[0:30:06] <atravelbee> @AngriestPat heard about the DRM?
[0:30:07] <Tracazoid> What? No Homer Make-up shotgun? Clearly they chose wrong.
[0:30:07] <%RubberFistFight> jesus christ the more I hear about it the more cancerous it sounds LUL
[0:30:08] <%tizz86> tizz86 is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to AngriestPat's community! They've gifted a total of 58 in the channel! 
[0:30:09] <Onmi_Khaos> It doesn't slow enemies down or do anything that actual makes fun of cryptocurrencies
[0:30:09] <suikudo> BL3 was cracked 2 days after it released
[0:30:09] <%tizz86> tizz86 gifted a Tier 1 sub to Basch71! 
[0:30:10] <deviljhojho94> "Like comment and obey"
[0:30:11] <%goose_attack_almanac> There's a Rick and Morty Mini-boss fight. There are multiple instances of Pickle Rick references
[0:30:12] <Onmi_Khaos> it's just LOLCRYPTO
[0:30:13] <@StridentSong> Not just a shotgun Pat. There's two enemies called Wick and Warty
[0:30:14] <+PatchworkSquid> @angriestpat I caved and got it. just got a grenade that is a reference to the first RE movie.
[0:30:19] <ExpressNode> I keep forgetting Rick and Morty was a thing since I never really saw the series but heard about it from the people around me
[0:30:20] <ISkyHunterI> @AngriestPat wait there are different skins in the game ? I am at 85% and had no idea

[0:30:26] <%ThatOneGameTester> Hello pat and chat
[0:30:29] <TomDanksEGOT> the whole gag around teh shotgun is its guarded by guys named Mick and Borty, like that's the extent of the 'joke'

[0:30:34] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat and all I want in that game is muscle girl Amara :/

[0:30:55] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat So are you completely boycotting BL3? Or do you think you might pick it up at some point? I don't think I'm going to get it at all.
[0:30:55] <%CherrieVelvet> oh..

[0:30:58] <DomunDomunDomun> @crankthulhu I think amber lamps was old by the first borderlands.

[0:31:00] <@StridentSong> StridentSong subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 33 month streak! Borderlands 3's writing is like a child just discovered the word "ass", and tries to put it in every conversation. It's fucking terrible.

[0:31:00] <Coystick> Hahhahaaha
[0:31:00] <+RiceeFTW> that's cursed

[0:31:02] <+PatchworkSquid> @indoorsitup it's called the "red queen" and it creates a laser to cut people up.
[0:31:03] <%Anime_Flux> Clearly you're the enemy, Pat
[0:31:04] <%gunzerkingdunce> They're the Paul brothers
[0:31:04] <bomfiz> do they dab?
[0:31:05] <%GarbageNirvana> Yeah but they're the bad ones though
[0:31:05] <Crankthulhu> You mean future E3 presentees?
[0:31:06] <laserbeaming> WELL FUCK
[0:31:06] <%Crushter> @ISkyHunterI his current one is from the Deluxe edition, there's one for both endings and one for collecting all the bones
[0:31:06] <+mugwugsampoo> xqcHAA
[0:31:06] <%floralkami> Randy, Why?
[0:31:07] <Aydarkzero> it's really fucking bad
[0:31:07] <deviljhojho94> their catchprase is "Like comment and obey"
[0:31:08] <etoir> I don't think you are for real
[0:31:08] <rainwater739> @AngriestPat You and Woolie are the reason I just bought the Dark Souls games.
[0:31:10] <Onmi_Khaos> ARE WE HIP WITH THE KIDS YET?!
[0:31:11] <soraabora> woahwoah some of them are actual va's though. like SungWon
[0:31:12] <heart_ablaze> LUL
[0:31:14] <%dukenux> But please Randy, tell us how you REALLY feel LUL
[0:31:14] <%rumtumtugnutz> @firearmsinstructor the voice over thing is about the Claptrap vo. he voiced the character in the first two games for free since he worked for Gearbox, but he left. they asked him to come back for the third one, he said he would if they paid him his executive salary like before, and Gearbox decided to replace him.
[0:31:16] <Strider222> yeah its horrible
[0:31:19] <+VantomPayne> LETS FLAY
[0:31:19] <pennykettle_> @AngriestPat does it make sense in universe? Or is it just a jab
[0:31:20] <%Basch71> Randy made the most cursed game this gen LuL
[0:31:21] <SourDoughRye> its meta pat get wth it
[0:31:22] <AzureHawk_Streams> Jesus
[0:31:22] <awalbaru> thats mony grabby strategyweebs thats insane
[0:31:22] <Dementedpenguin> I wonder how well Borderlands 3 is gonna hold up ten years from now? Kappa
[0:31:23] <%nmaten> thats fucking hilarious actually
[0:31:23] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> It's their only fucking gimmick too
[0:31:24] <Valdorick> Randy saw you making fun of his BFF Cliffy B and made you, Pat, the villain of the game.
[0:31:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's fucking embarassing. like my ability to spell
[0:31:25] <%dalmek> nono, they're called Lets FLAYers
[0:31:25] <%logoth_> Hello fellow kidz
[0:31:26] <Coystick> How Do You Do, Fellow Kids: The Game
[0:31:28] <%dalmek> and Live SCREAMERS
[0:31:30] <%hrudzie_1> hes right
[0:31:30] <%dalmek> BIG difference
[0:31:31] <%Mr_Strut> I don't believe you.
[0:31:32] <%RantingRavager> a little on the nose
[0:31:33] <$TheDoctor19901> they are also parasites/leeches in the game, thats how theyget power, just like real streaers
[0:31:35] <%ThatOneGameTester> yeah they do live killings and such for views
[0:31:35] <jellssssss20> Repeat it for clips
[0:31:38] <%nmaten> randy's number 1 enemy: influencers
[0:31:38] <JackalKing> How much you want to bet Randy insisted on that because livestreamers and youtubers kept making fun of him?
[0:31:39] <ExpressNode> I'd love to see you stream it though so I can gaze back into the past of memes
[0:31:42] <%hrudzie_1> no hes totally right
[0:31:42] <Rosy_Joan> @rumtumtugnutz oh and Randy punched him right?
[0:31:44] <+Caped_Eggy> For once in his life, pat is right
[0:31:44] <ZE_Count> Streamers are the true evil says Randy as he demands more crunch time and shits on the voice actors.
[0:31:45] <%Mr_Strut> That sounds too stupid even for Randy
[0:31:46] <jellssssss20> And those of us that didn’t hear
[0:31:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> they're good villains. the Like, subscribe, and obey thing gets old.
[0:31:47] <ISkyHunterI> Is there a more JUST person than randy LUL
[0:31:51] <%SGrim> @pennykettle_ considering they also tied in using twitch viewership to generate loot. It's just an asspull.
[0:31:52] <%ShogunNoonto> what up its god queen tyween comeing at you live
[0:31:53] <%dukenux> Man, now i kinda want you to play it, if only so you might find a cringey "parody" of yourself @AngriestPat
[0:31:55] <IndoorSitup> DO THEY REFERENCE TWITCH MEMES THO?
[0:31:57] <atravelbee> @AngriestPat have you heard about the BL3 DRM?
[0:31:58] <%NeroInfinite> I think Rivercity Girls was the only recent thing that pulled off having youtubers/streamers in their games and not made it cringy.
[0:32:01] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat that's basically like how the bad guys in Ghostbusters 2016 were.... ghostbusters fans. Fucking insulting. "Haha, let's unabashedly take a swing at our target audience, we're so awesome". Fuck off with that asinine garbage, holy fucking shit. But of course morons the world round drink it up. Because THEY'RE MORONS.
[0:32:06] <Onmi_Khaos> Randy Pitchford just wants to Hold My Beer himself
[0:32:09] <%FirearmsInstructor> @rumtumtugnutz and didn't compensate him for the work he put it... wow. That's SUPER greasy and slimy... moreso if it was planned and didn't just "happen".
[0:32:12] <%grayjammer> how fucking topical ugh
[0:32:20] <shevan123> alright what the fuck
[0:32:21] <Coystick> A Hate-through

[0:32:31] <beetbo2> Remember
[0:32:35] <%floralkami> @angriestpat can you say this was a direct attack to your image and business?
[0:32:36] <beetbo2> pirate bay
[0:32:39] <worldbrand> there's no rush, it's not like 2019 is running low on good games
[0:32:40] <beetbo2> is a thing
[0:32:42] <lionmanguy> No it's easy. Just wait around two weeks for the internet to inevitably crack the drm
[0:32:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[0:32:44] <%valriot> @angriestpat Just turn off all the game audio besides sound effects
[0:32:44] <+RiceeFTW> I
[0:32:45] <%genowyn> Don't give randy your money tho
[0:32:45] <%Ascethetic> i dont think anyone here would be upset if you pirated it
[0:32:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> cant pirate BL3 because SUPER DUPER DENUVO
[0:32:47] <%derekwst3> its not a bad game, but its not that great either
[0:32:54] <+RiceeFTW> I I
[0:32:55] <%EmiinV> EmiinV subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! don't give in pat, resist the playthrough
[0:32:56] <cosmicgoatee> Pat what do you think will be the next szechuan sauce/popeyes chicken sandwich debacle
[0:32:56] <+PatchworkSquid> I'm mad that I like it.
[0:32:57] <beetbo2> Just wait for the crack lol
[0:32:59] <ISkyHunterI> Is is still written by anthony burch ?
[0:33:00] <shevan123> is it time for FUCKING PIRACY
[0:33:02] <suikudo> BL3 Denuvo was cracked after 2 days
[0:33:03] <+RiceeFTW> I II
[0:33:06] <%dukenux> Super Denuvo that also gimps performance
[0:33:07] <beetbo2> YO HO YO HO
[0:33:08] <%mayorrev> i was away for a bit, what's this game about
[0:33:09] <7th_justiceflame> Numbers
[0:33:10] <%Crushter> he's almost there
[0:33:11] <%dukenux> Yay, for legal users Kappa
[0:33:11] <suikudo> Go look it up
[0:33:13] <Coystick> I don't U N D E R S T A N D
[0:33:13] <ミュウレ4242> why not play a good game instead. there's a few left.
[0:33:14] <pennykettle_> I can handle bad meme references, but every line needing a punchline is what kills me. I hate FEELING the setup for a joke
[0:33:16] <GiygasDrillBreak> you cant UNinstall BL3, because the Denuvo is so powerful it forces BL3 to stay on your PC
[0:33:17] <IndoorSitup> *whispers* i dont think anyone would be too upset if you got it but got in in a way where you didnt spend any money if you know what i mean
[0:33:21] <jellssssss20> *Acquire* it Pat, or try to get paid for saying “whatever you would like” about the game, not that that would ever happen @angriestpat
[0:33:22] <+mugwugsampoo> R)
[0:33:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is the LP thing a lighthearted joke? Wink and a nod? Or is it a real dig and malevolent? (I'm guessing the flatter from your reaction.)
[0:33:24] <%Anime_Flux> I dig this spooky music
[0:33:25] <TomDanksEGOT> the numbers are changing
[0:33:25] <%TomServal> The answer is "Loss"?
[0:33:25] <%RubberFistFight> @GiygasDrillBreak Denuvo's already been broken, dude. Like... a day after launch.
[0:33:25] <ExpressNode> Does Denuvo still super wreck your shit nowadays?
[0:33:26] <+FoolsArcade> omg pat are you serious
[0:33:27] <heart_ablaze> One good thing about Borderlands 3s villains is that they make you REALLY want to kill them...
[0:33:28] <%kiiiirsten> half do not return :)
[0:33:29] <Yrefe> the numbers!
[0:33:32] <%kiiiirsten> LULW
[0:33:35] <+FoolsArcade> HALF DO NOT RETURN PAT
[0:33:36] <Caidezes> ProZD is the only good thing about Borderlands 3, aside from the gameplay.
[0:33:37] <GiygasDrillBreak> proofs?
[0:33:39] <%Crushter> whoops
[0:33:41] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:41] <%RantingRavager> everyone passes :)
[0:33:44] <+FoolsArcade> it doesnt matter how high
[0:33:47] <pennykettle_> Are the BL3 classes at least fun
[0:33:48] <%Ascethetic> why does this music remind me of Dead Cells?
[0:33:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is neat.
[0:33:52] <worldbrand> Huh
[0:33:52] <%Calek> @FoolsArcade it does matter

[0:34:03] <pennykettle_> Ascethetic now that you mention it
[0:34:03] <%Crushter> :doubt:
[0:34:05] <Mendin> It does matter how high it goes because Everyone Passes

[0:34:21] <cosmicgoatee> 42 the meaning of life, obviously
[0:34:21] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if the game had put that in slide-puzzle form though... Kappa
[0:34:22] <Smart_ZaK1> All that for a GRAPE
[0:34:22] <%NovaKnightmare> Hi everybody am I late
[0:34:23] <HorribleHog> That puzzle was impossible to solve well done Pat

[0:34:35] <awalbaru> the only way to achieve Half is to have for in one side
[0:34:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> TPB doesn't have BL3, whoever said the Denuvo got cracked is a lying shit
[0:34:38] <%primax104> @NovaKnightmare nah, he started playing maybe 15 minutes ago

[0:35:34] <Mendin> So Pat hasn't even seen 2/3 of this yet
[0:35:34] <ミュウレ4242> trying to fight the plague w/ silver ions, while still eating food w/ rat dung in it.
[0:35:37] <%AbnormalVoid> my cup now
[0:35:37] <%umbypokochan> please tel me those are slide puzzles that get rearranged and pat has to solve them
[0:35:38] <GiygasDrillBreak> FLOWER QUEST
[0:35:39] <worldbrand> Wh
[0:35:40] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat because this is kind of a bitch, you now have to go kill those three enemies without dying OR teleporting
[0:35:40] <%Pinkaminks> Enjoy the Blasphemous version of the worst Hollow Knight sidequest
[0:35:42] <%dalmek> welcome to Delicate Flower
[0:35:46] <Coystick> This was a neat little quest
[0:35:46] <%dalmek> Blasphemous edition
[0:35:47] <worldbrand> Oh, oh no
[0:35:47] <+PatchworkSquid> holy shit. just looked up a spoiler for a decision you have to make in BL3. . . even the guide says "wow. . . keeping it fresh with the latest memes, huh gearbox"
[0:35:49] <krlos970> This side quest is bullsh***
[0:35:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> enjoy Delicate Flower
[0:36:02] <heart_ablaze> This is gonna be fun
[0:36:05] <+RiceeFTW> Aslan hggShaq hggShaq
[0:36:11] <%korth367> PUZZLES
[0:36:11] <cosmicgoatee> Oh no this is delicate flower fuck

[0:36:15] <IndoorSitup> @patchworksquid What is it? Spoil dat shit
[0:36:18] <GiygasDrillBreak> it's not locked
[0:36:23] <%Pinkaminks> You do not
[0:36:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Time to fuck that Jesus lion.
[0:36:24] <Mendin> You havent seen two of them
[0:36:25] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat you haven't seen the first enemy yet
[0:36:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> the biggest problem with Borderlands 3 is that Borderlands 2 is the same game.
[0:36:25] <%moogleboy1984> it's not locked
[0:36:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> the quest doesnt start until you kill #1
[0:36:28] <moragtang> It's not as bad as the flower. LUL
[0:36:29] <ミュウレ4242> i didn't know catholisism had tentacle monsters.
[0:36:34] <worldbrand> I'd kinda appreciate the equivalent challenge but with "dont sit at a bonfire" instead of "dont get hit"
[0:36:38] <+SamleyTimes> EZ compared to flower
[0:36:39] <%Crushter> nope
[0:36:43] <%Calek> nope
[0:36:43] <jellssssss20> Oh boy finishing the white flower quest from hollow knight
[0:36:43] <%Pinkaminks> You haven't
[0:36:44] <%Crushter> there's another one
[0:36:44] <moragtang> Even if you teleport it just resets the quest, not break it.
[0:36:49] <not_twitter_rowan> different version
[0:36:50] <+PatchworkSquid> @indoorsitup it's a mustache joke. lame af.
[0:36:51] <ZE_Count> Conehead Jesus is pretty cool.
[0:36:54] <%moogleboy1984> it's not as brutal as the flower, but it's definitely bullshit
[0:36:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> you can quit and reload the game and NOT lose progress in the quest
[0:36:56] <%dukenux> the Bible has leviathan
[0:36:59] <ExpressNode> Shooter?, Looter?...... SHCLOOTER?!
[0:36:59] <%NovaKnightmare> thats the BASIS of all forms of Christianity

[0:37:03] <%nmaten> japan cant have all the fun
[0:37:03] <%dukenux> which is a sort of sea monster i gues
[0:37:04] <%Mr_Strut> Catholocism invented tentacle monsters
[0:37:05] <cureneckbeard> haven't you seen bible black
[0:37:07] <%InugamiTheHound> the Japanese version?
[0:37:09] <%umbypokochan> haven't you heard of the jesus fish?
[0:37:10] <%Crushter> You keep the cup, you just have to fill it back up if you spill it
[0:37:10] <jellssssss20> But only leviathan?
[0:37:11] <%Calek> how do you think Mary got pregant
[0:37:26] <%EmiinV> a snake is really just one evil tentacle if you think about it
[0:37:26] <%Invlux> if course it has tentacle monsters, they're called Cardinals
[0:37:29] <%Pinkaminks> you get notified whenever you kill the right enemy
[0:37:33] <%Mr_Strut> To be fair, there's not many tentacle monsters in Bible Black. Mostly just futas.
[0:37:37] <%Crushter> The recommened order is Statue, Lion, Bull
[0:37:40] <%dukenux> altho apparently leviathan is just a hippo. which is less cool, but way scarier.
[0:37:47] <carzeri> the music in this game is above average
[0:37:48] <%primax104> Happiest Pat?
[0:37:52] <+SamleyTimes> fuc
[0:37:59] <%Calek> leviathan being a hippo makes a lot of sense
[0:37:59] <heart_ablaze> Fuck
[0:37:59] <deviljhojho94> if hippos had thumbs we would all be fucked
[0:38:00] <tetriata> Those sewage pipes seem really out of place
[0:38:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mr_Strut And shotguns
[0:38:05] <claivian> you have to kill them all without warping to my knowledge

[0:38:56] <%dukenux> @deviljhojho94 you know what, you might be right, and i mightve mixed those up
[0:38:59] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat there's a bonfire in the library early on, you didn't need to use that one haha

[0:39:29] <Mendin> The ultimate deoweapon
[0:39:32] <worldbrand> the librarby
[0:39:43] <DracaenaLeaf> A lot of people apparently dislike the plot
[0:39:43] <flattopswag> Ok is saying the word like that a Canadian thing or is Pat just...well, Pat
[0:39:44] <%Crushter> It's a shame cause the game seems great, mechanically
[0:39:46] <+RiceeFTW> that's pathetic
[0:39:46] <heart_ablaze> Oh god
[0:39:47] <+SamleyTimes> ohhh nooo
[0:39:50] <IndoorSitup> How is it on consoles??
[0:39:50] <%Ascethetic> wow
[0:39:50] <%nmaten> what fps was he getting lmao
[0:39:53] <%filialpails> but what's his CPU?
[0:39:53] <%42nfl19> What kind of CPU?
[0:39:54] <GiygasDrillBreak> that sounds like some bad DRM, mate
[0:39:55] <laserbeaming> HOW?
[0:39:56] <beetbo2> CPU?
[0:39:56] <atravelbee> thats 10 more than 1080
[0:39:57] <%Kiiper> 1080p runs at like 80fps with massive FPs drops in combat and menus
[0:39:59] <ExpressNode> Holy shit that game doesn't sound optimized. Just imaginie it at 4k
[0:39:59] <+RiceeFTW> get a quad 2080ti nerds
[0:39:59] <%dukenux> It is
[0:39:59] <Ultimatefool> Obviously the game is too advanced for modern graphics
[0:40:02] <%sandwichtaker> Sounds badass if I say so myself
[0:40:04] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat you watch skillup?
[0:40:04] <Coystick> How is Gearbox still in Business?
[0:40:05] <%Big_Dream> download more ram
[0:40:06] <Mendin> WELCOME TO CASTLEVANIA
[0:40:07] <+Roundelay11> I hate these book fuckers
[0:40:07] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's more DRM threads than game threads in BL3
[0:40:07] <%moogleboy1984> on the regular PS4 it dips between 30-15 fps
[0:40:08] <%RubberFistFight> wait I missed that, what game runs like that?
[0:40:09] <worldbrand> I dont think anyone with a 2080TI has an underperforming CPU
[0:40:09] <%gunzerkingdunce> yeah even console struggles
[0:40:11] <heart_ablaze> CPU THO?
[0:40:12] <%kiiiirsten> LMAOO WHAT IS THAT ENEMY
[0:40:14] <carzeri> lol thats a 1000 bucks GPU. nice optimization
[0:40:17] <Valdorick> B-but... but you stylize your artstyle so you DON'T need the black obelisk as a slave GPU
[0:40:18] <DrFacilier> Agreed. BL3 improved on many things, performance was Not one of them
[0:40:20] <IndoorSitup> I imagine that shit is worse on consoles
[0:40:22] <ISkyHunterI> The word badass is forever ruined for me because of randy
[0:40:22] <%Dr_DangerPhD> shoulda had 2 2080 TI's in SLI Kappa
[0:40:23] <%Big_Dream> more like processing power
[0:40:23] <SourDoughRye> but can it run on switch
[0:40:24] <%Crushter> Those shakespearian meduas enemies are great
[0:40:33] <%dukenux> oof
[0:40:33] <IndoorSitup> rekt
[0:40:35] <Mendin> #gotem
[0:40:35] <%kiiiirsten> DO YOU?
[0:40:36] <%42nfl19> what kind of CPU did he have?
[0:40:40] <%Pinkaminks> And so begins the next 2 hours of pat getting knocked off platforms by books.
[0:40:46] <ExpressNode> But a PS4 and a Xbone can run that better.... right?
[0:40:46] <GiygasDrillBreak> BL3 is so Big Brain Randy it cant run on 2080 Super SLI
[0:40:47] <Jetsfantasy> Spend 1K+ on a gpu and can't even get 1080 60fps
[0:40:50] <%RantingRavager> please return your overdue books
[0:41:02] <%Crushter> @Pinkaminks oh i'm ready, are you excited for the castlevania rooms in the Painted gallery?
[0:41:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Look at these Shakespeare-ass mutherfuckers.
[0:41:06] <%kiiiirsten> Bookmerang PogChamp
[0:41:11] <ミュウレ4242> they only want you to buy it. it doesn't have to work.
[0:41:12] <DrFacilier> I have run into numerous bugs in which a quest will completely break and ya gotta leave and return to area
[0:41:13] <+Javaa01> Yeah, DX12 is busted, and running most any of the settings on ultra is both a terrible idea from a performance standpoint, and they basically don't even make any visible difference
[0:41:15] <GiygasDrillBreak> IGNORE THAT WALL
[0:41:16] <%Mr_Strut> Why is Shakespeare's head trying to kill you?
[0:41:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think some of these performance issues are overblown cause i have had zero issues on PC.
[0:41:18] <+Roundelay11> it's a one way shortcut
[0:41:20] <%moogleboy1984> the bookmerang hits like a truck filled with dead babies
[0:41:23] <AzureHawk_Streams> Attack of the Shakespearean heads
[0:41:25] <Animal_Farm4> Run over. Reset
[0:41:26] <Jetsfantasy> Charge move?
[0:41:26] <%Pinkaminks> Im very much ready to watch pat die a billion times to spikes, yes
[0:41:28] <+Roundelay11> you can only hit it from the other side
[0:41:29] <+RiceeFTW> speed run ruined
[0:41:31] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat How is BL3 on consoles? I imagine it's worse.
[0:41:33] <TheMj23ad> is he running it on Directx 12?
[0:41:36] <ISkyHunterI> Fuck this area and the area after it NotLikeThis
[0:41:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Speed run over, do it again.
[0:41:42] <%rumtumtugnutz> but I'm not entirely sure what my settings are set at.
[0:41:42] <HorribleHog> start over juliar1Pur
[0:41:44] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> this area's music is kingdom hearts as fuck
[0:41:47] <jellssssss20> Hey @angriestpat would you ever/have you ever played that SCP Containment Breach game?
[0:41:48] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if he has a 2080 ti probs like a 9900k so it won't bottleneck right?
[0:41:48] <Mendin> This area and the area after it are Peak Castlevania
[0:41:52] <TomDanksEGOT> @IndoorSitup bad, even on Pro set to performance you get maybe 30 fps loading times are decent but base models have ridiculous loading times and some of the worst menu lag in any game and even worse frames
[0:41:56] <%Kiiper> DX12 has better FPS but hitches constantly during battles
[0:41:57] <GiygasDrillBreak> to play BL3 on PS4, Randy comes to your house to personally put his diarrhea in your mouth
[0:41:58] <%moogleboy1984> this area isn't nearly as bad as the Canvases
[0:42:01] <%AgniBrandt> SkillUp did have issues, but apparently his brother (running a much more modest rig) didn't. Performance seems to be all over the place for different setups.
[0:42:02] <%nmaten> how does borderlands run poorly
[0:42:05] <Coystick> I forgot about this guy
[0:42:05] <%Kiiper> BX11 lower FPS but less hitches
[0:42:06] <ExpressNode> Now that I put my headphones on I can hear the great music
[0:42:06] <+Roundelay11> I never figured out what this guy wanted
[0:42:06] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat I just need dlc now, 100 percent on steam and in game :c
[0:42:08] <%zamzoph> ))) NotLikeThis (((
[0:42:08] <ZE_Count> got a big jangle of keys there
[0:42:10] <%Pinkaminks> Canvasas is probably the most annoying zone, yeah
[0:42:11] <worldbrand> is that guy my sister? she keeps like a million keys and charms on her keychain
[0:42:12] <laserbeaming> How is everyone so big?
[0:42:13] <%Laecerelius> Gotta wait a bit to wonder if good boi or bad boi
[0:42:14] <claivian> kinda feel like contact damage in a game where enemies already have attacks is sorta dumb
[0:42:16] <DrFacilier> @IndoorSitup What Tom said, the fucking Menu LAAAAG
[0:42:19] <%Crushter> @Roundelay11 there's a ghost in the room with the noise
[0:42:25] <%InugamiTheHound> gascoigne??
[0:42:28] <GiygasDrillBreak> he wants SOMEONE to STOP making noise in the library
[0:42:33] <%akaAxi0m> Yea is that Papa G
[0:42:36] <Mendin> "This sound does not cease" "You are a worm through time. Red eyes, then yellow and green. You hear this and you want to, etc etc etc"
[0:42:36] <ExpressNode> Oh yeah, anyone see the new steam library update? I like how it looks now.
[0:42:38] <SourDoughRye> whats that sound?
[0:42:40] <%Invlux> anybody noticing audio lag on Pat's facecam?
[0:42:48] <%kiiiirsten> LUL
[0:42:48] <ISkyHunterI> @Roundelay11 you need to equip the talk to dead relic and find a certain ghost in the library
[0:42:52] <Hawajiggaba> Boomerang books?
[0:42:52] <%ThatOneGameTester> the games industry is too busy chasing shinier graphics to actually optimize a game right. and since Games as a service means you're gonna deal with it or you can't play at all AND they get to kill it whenever for the next product. so why bother in their eyes
[0:42:52] <%RubberFistFight> I'm gonna point out what I point out every single time a broken game releases on epic: The devs no longer have to produce a marketable product because Big Daddy Chinabux is bankrolling them, regardless of how well they sell.
[0:43:00] <moragtang> These book-throwing fuckers are the worst enemies. They're the primal aspids of this game.
[0:43:02] <worldbrand> that's sneaky

[0:43:56] <%gunzerkingdunce> Did Pat finish River City Girls?
[0:43:57] <%dalmek> They'll start calling you Patrick Yungboivin now
[0:43:59] <%nmaten> pats good at finding his own kind

[0:44:30] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> This game doesn't really have stats in the normal sense, so you can't really get big huge

[0:45:10] <Ultimatefool> Why is that guy throwing a pizza at you?
[0:45:13] <laserbeaming> Can you hit those books out of the air?
[0:45:16] <%RubberFistFight> So the bile flasks heal a specific hit point number, instead of a flat "percentage of", like estus do.
[0:45:17] <%Crushter> @worldbrand if you think paintings are spikes

[0:46:18] <%floralkami> @angriestpat i also just learned this, but wait a bit to pick up your guilt fragments when you really need health during a boss. the guilt fragments function as moderate health restores.
[0:46:34] <AdmiralButtloaf> @spyder_casual pat found a hidden barf bottle by accident

[0:49:01] <ZE_Count> Does pat ever use all the other magics??
[0:49:01] <SourDoughRye> pat is a slave to his habits NotLikeThis
[0:49:07] <%floralkami> is that a floating aristocrat head?
[0:49:14] <WarchiefGoldva> There's like a lore entrance about the beautiful girl that people made statues of to the point where the religious zealots were all like "SHE'S A SAINT" and she burns her face so people would leave her the fuck alone. It canonized her in their religion instead. That's nightmare fuel, dude.

[0:49:28] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami YES and it's being created by a headless corpse carrying its own decaying head on a platter

[0:50:07] <%dukenux> monkaS
[0:50:08] <moragtang> @WarchiefGoldva Yeah a lot of this game is "people are fucks, horrible thing happens, people think the horrible thing is even cooler"
[0:50:11] <%kiiiirsten> That room was full of fart gas
[0:50:14] <ミュウレ4242> WarchiefGoldva, idol culture is sick.

[0:50:30] <%reneries> are there a lot of gruesome deaths for the MC?
[0:50:31] <GiygasDrillBreak> i like how Penitent One has that 1 frame of animation he's doing the Devil Trigger dance
[0:50:43] <Mendin> Yes that's the power of the hair t hing
[0:50:44] <worldbrand> i bet if you replace "Miracle" with "super metal thing" the lore suddenly makes sense
[0:50:48] <%Crushter> that does a lot of damage

[0:51:22] <%floralkami> HOW AMNY TIMES AM I GONNA HAVE TO ASK WHIT THE FUUUUUUUCK
[0:51:23] <%kiiiirsten> Excuse me?!
[0:51:25] <%blaccbird914> is that swinging around a lady?
[0:51:26] <%Mr_Strut> Oh, that's a tiny person on top of a big person.
[0:51:35] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat taranto is more expensive than the beam
[0:51:45] <%moogleboy1984> @blaccbird914 it's a woman, riding on top of a giant dude, swinging an elk carcass
[0:51:47] <%Pinkaminks> pat pls take off weight of true guilt
[0:51:47] <%FirearmsInstructor> How prevalent are secret walls / floors, etc?

[0:51:54] <%kiiiirsten> uffer
[0:51:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> tiny lady using a giants head as a dildo?
[0:52:00] <%floralkami> @mr_strut that's a lady with a vaguna that turned into a giant
[0:52:00] <%Crushter> @FirearmsInstructor pretty common
[0:52:02] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I haven't seen other streamers have these treasure chests for items, they just find them on the ground. What's up with that?
[0:52:05] <+SamleyTimes> dr evil
[0:52:10] <%Ranryu692> what about Popola?
[0:52:12] <%Pinkaminks> some items are in chests
[0:52:15] <%blaccbird914> @moogleboy1984 ok thanks i couldn't tell what it was from a distance but thats metal
[0:52:17] <%Pinkaminks> usually not though
[0:52:17] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat those dicks with the elks, i always found it easier to basically hug their ankles. most of their shit misses you then.
[0:52:22] <GiygasDrillBreak> there's way more bare floor items than chest items
[0:52:23] <%Crushter> @Hunk_Of_Dunk chests are present, but they're uncommon
[0:52:25] <Jetsfantasy> Pat, slit your wrists when you rest, then heal for full HP/MP
[0:52:26] <Trash_leviathan> but debla is cooler pat you have to do it for the style points

[0:53:15] <%gespenst25> Pat, does the world not make sense because I'm hypoglycemic, because of something in this game or am I actually in some lynchian hell right now?
[0:53:15] <WarchiefGoldva> She's constantly being eaten by the giant she's riding. That's metal.
[0:53:18] <%floralkami> BUY ANOTHER
[0:53:24] <worldbrand> that's generous at least
[0:53:25] <%Crushter> with the miracle buff rosary and the sword heart that buffs magic its so good
[0:53:27] <moragtang> Read, motherfucker!!
[0:53:28] <%moogleboy1984> @floralkami I wouldn't be surprised if it's supposed to be her son and it's connected through some kind of umbilical cord

[0:54:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Local file? Just copy and paste?
[0:54:13] <%floralkami> @moogleboy1984 thanks, my theory wasn't disturbing enough
[0:54:16] <+burgerdicks> is that an arcana reference? Or is the characters name delores
[0:54:21] <worldbrand> look out pat
[0:54:21] <%Crushter> I like how good the game is at giving you upgrades fairly regularly
[0:54:32] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat wait, a game with Catholic theming and iconography has "corruption" issues? Kappa
[0:54:43] <%moogleboy1984> japes
[0:54:47] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Have you ever played The After Years?
[0:55:01] <Dreigun> what even was that enemy?
[0:55:08] <%Crushter> It's a woman riding a giant
[0:55:13] <WarchiefGoldva> A lady riding a giant's face.
[0:55:19] <JohnA83> Is this on Steam or Epic?
[0:55:20] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight i clapped. the funny man did the joke!
[0:55:22] <+RiceeFTW> and the giant is using an elk as a club LMAO
[0:55:23] <%moogleboy1984> good luck on this one
[0:55:24] <WarchiefGoldva> The giant wields a deer as a weapon.
[0:55:25] <worldbrand> A lady on a giant holding a dead stag
[0:55:26] <Mendin> Steam/PS4/Switch
[0:55:31] <%Pinkaminks> so, place bets now, will he figure this out himself?
[0:55:36] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat this is very obtuse, the clues are present on the three bones you find that match them
[0:55:39] <%Typhaeon> I think so
[0:55:39] <Mendin> Well he only has 2 of t he bones
[0:55:41] <Trash_leviathan> LEG
[0:55:41] <laserbeaming> Oh, that's very Castlevania
[0:55:42] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami :D
[0:55:43] <shevan123> he might, he figured out the other puzzles pretty well
[0:55:51] <moragtang> It ain't too hard, he's a smart boy. I hope. LUL
[0:55:54] <%Pinkaminks> yeah but the other puzzles are a lot more straight forward
[0:55:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Got a solid favorite part of this game yet? Mechanic / enemy / artwork, etc.
[0:55:55] <+burgerdicks> We need the corpse parts
[0:56:00] <%Typhaeon> Man don't just tell him
[0:56:02] <GiygasDrillBreak> nobody else help him
[0:56:07] <%Bluwizard21> do you want the answer cause it's still kind of annoying
[0:56:09] <%Crushter> @Typhaeon you have to figure out
[0:56:12] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami don't worry, I'm painfully aware at how terrible and low-hanging-fruit my humour is.
[0:56:15] <moragtang> Well. It's too much to hope chat to not say anything I guess.
[0:56:21] <%Ranryu692> I thought that said "an analog book" and I hated it
[0:56:27] <%Typhaeon> I know, I've solved the puzzle, but it's more fun to see him struggle
[0:56:30] <%Crushter> a lot of people thought you needed just bones though
[0:56:31] <+burgerdicks> How can one man hold all these stand powers?
[0:56:35] <%Crushter> or tried to submit bones
[0:56:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> Good thing Paige isn't here... she's be apatBig sploshing all over the couch. neohWhat
[0:56:48] <Baka_Shinji17> The Bone Tome
[0:56:58] <%InugamiTheHound> oh man Paige loves skeletons and their bones
[0:56:59] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight dude, i love that kind of humour
[0:57:00] <%moogleboy1984> Do you think Paige would get dirty with a Femur?
[0:57:01] <%Big_Dream> you ahve the tibia
[0:57:05] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat you just passed the tibia
[0:57:05] <laserbeaming> You had a tibia
[0:57:06] <%Big_Dream> last one
[0:57:07] <manoshake> get rid of all items
[0:57:08] <%Pinkaminks> Note: You dont actually need all the bones to do it, they just tell you how to do it
[0:57:13] <%kiiiirsten> wow cause nobodky knows patella
[0:57:15] <ZE_Count> So how real is the bones thing with Paige like how real real is it?
[0:57:21] <Mendin> Concerningly real
[0:57:24] <%Crushter> @ZE_Count it's pretty real
[0:57:28] <%Typhaeon> Patella is too similar to paella for the Spaniards Kappa
[0:57:28] <%dalmek> she has a Papyrus body pillow
[0:57:30] <cureneckbeard> it's just a really dedicated bit
[0:57:30] <%FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight Digging a troth into the dirt so you can get even lower? ;)
[0:57:32] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat if you want the answer all u have to do is ask, as it is still kinda obtuse what you need to do
[0:57:36] <%dalmek> and "pictures' on her phone
[0:57:37] <%floralkami> Paige really should be here for the next two bosses
[0:57:37] <Smart_ZaK1> It is not a gimmick
[0:57:48] <worldbrand> so no items and full blue meter, and one last thing we dont know?
[0:57:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's a trash clue right there.
[0:57:49] <cureneckbeard> halloween
[0:57:50] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat the first one looks like you need to unequip everything
[0:57:50] <WarchiefGoldva> Fervent? Max fervor?
[0:57:53] <RevolverBobkat> technical term for kneecap is Patella
[0:58:01] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat the third is full favor by the looks of it
[0:58:04] <a_mad_dragon> PATELLA
[0:58:06] <%mayorrev> I shot an old man in the kneecaps
[0:58:17] <+SamleyTimes> big video game IQ
[0:58:18] <%floralkami> @firearmsinstructor @rubberfistfight yeah, get that really gooey mud deep below
[0:58:18] <JohnA83> So what even is this game?
[0:58:21] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat you still have items
[0:58:30] <Mendin> @JohnA83 Spanish Catholic Bloodborne Metroidvania
[0:58:30] <%QueequegTheater> Why does Titania EX take so long to queue for
[0:58:31] <+SamleyTimes> @JohnA83 if dark souls was a metroidvania
[0:58:32] <%Crushter> @JohnA83 it's a metroidvania at heart
[0:58:35] <+arfsm95> you passed the patela
[0:58:36] <%kiiiirsten> YOu have someone's asshole in your bag?
[0:58:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> #
[0:58:40] <Onmi_Khaos> @AngriestPat Have you ever played The After Years?
[0:58:44] <JohnA83> Cool

[0:58:47] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat you passed the patela
[0:58:52] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor you know it, man.
[0:58:54] <%floralkami> @kiiiirsten what, you don't?
[0:59:02] <Mendin> No he didn't, the patella is literally not gotten to yet
[0:59:03] <deviljhojho94> Man the game is actually pretty long
[0:59:06] <worldbrand> i totally didn't see it either
[0:59:09] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat the patella is ahead
[0:59:10] <Mendin> *Kneecap
[0:59:13] <%kiiiirsten> @floralkami I try to leave it at home when I go to church
[0:59:14] <GiygasDrillBreak> no patella yet, also he isnt naked
[0:59:14] <%Bluwizard21> @angriest you have to take out the core at a shrine
[0:59:15] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Middle
[0:59:17] <WarchiefGoldva> You need a save point to mess around with the sword.
[0:59:21] <ahmz1404> its not patella, its kneecap
[0:59:23] <%blankwaffle> top right corner
[0:59:26] <%Crushter> err kneecap
[0:59:29] <%floralkami> KNEECAP?
[0:59:31] <deviljhojho94> Not gonna lie, back when this was unreleased I tought it was gonna be a mediocre game carried by art style but this is damn good
[0:59:33] <%Pinkaminks> 100% is ~15 hours, going off what I got
[0:59:39] <ahmz1404> its called kneecap
[0:59:40] <moragtang> It's not that obtuse, it's actually called Kneecap.
[0:59:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Oh whops. You were scrolling too fast. I P-something.
[0:59:43] <%blankwaffle> shit
[0:59:44] <%Typhaeon> It's just "kneecal"
[0:59:44] <Slim_Lipid> Why isn't this al0habetical NotLikeThis
[0:59:45] <Mendin> HE DOES NOT HAVE AND CAN NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE KNEECAP YET
[0:59:48] <ZE_Count> Bones are weird
[0:59:48] <%Typhaeon> kneecap. Not Patella
[0:59:49] <%RubberFistFight> it's pronounced "cossix"

[1:00:09] <cosmicgoatee> I feel like you're building an entire skeleton
[1:00:09] <%QueequegTheater> @AngriestPat I'm not taking the blame for this one
[1:00:13] <bomfiz> idk what the purpose of that room is
[1:00:24] <%Crushter> @bomfiz it's a puzzle, the bones tell you what to do
[1:00:25] <Mendin> It's a nice obtuse puzzle
[1:00:26] <%kiiiirsten> @floralkami That's why I take my bf with me
[1:00:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> @QueequegTheater YOUR FAULT! SHAME!!!
[1:00:29] <CivilDiscord> it will straight up say kneecap
[1:00:30] <%einheri> einheri subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[1:00:31] <%RubberFistFight> wait why are people saying "not patella, kneecap". They're literally the same thing. The former is the proper name for the latter.
[1:00:32] <%QueequegTheater> NO
[1:00:35] <%QueequegTheater> IT WASN'T ME
[1:00:36] <%Pinkaminks> Oh im dumb, I kept asking him to take off the weight of true guilt and it was the hair.
[1:00:49] <%Typhaeon> Because the item in game is "kneecap of blahblah"
[1:00:53] <%Ascethetic> everytime chat is wrong, we blame @QueequegTheater
[1:00:53] <Smart_ZaK1> kneecap is the name of the item in the game
[1:00:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @QueequegTheater Ok Shaggy.
[1:00:57] <%floralkami> @kiiiirsten well that just sounds kinky
[1:00:59] <bomfiz> @Crushter wait what. I thought it was relating to the collectibles.
[1:01:01] <%Crushter> @Pinkaminks he doesn't know about the ending stuff
[1:01:08] <WarchiefGoldva> Blood fireflies.
[1:01:08] <%Bane_Kaikyo> reequip the other stufff @AngriestPat
[1:01:09] <%Crushter> @bomfiz nope, it gives a miracle
[1:01:10] <%QueequegTheater> I hate you chat
[1:01:10] <%RubberFistFight> @Typhaeon considering they've given the formal names of all the bones prior to that, I highly doubt it, but ok.
[1:01:11] <CivilDiscord> kneecap of the puppeteer is what it will say
[1:01:12] <%Pinkaminks> Yeah that would make sense
[1:01:16] <%Tearonex> @QueequegTheater IT WAS THE BUTTERFLY I TELL YOU! THE BUTTERFLY!!
[1:01:18] <%kiiiirsten> @floralkami It would be, if i had a bf or went to church LUL
[1:01:24] <%Typhaeon> No, it is
[1:01:31] <+SamleyTimes> i brute forced this puzzle multiple times LUL
[1:01:31] <%Ascethetic> @QueequegTheater <3
[1:01:32] <%1matheuw> oh no i gotta watch the VOD
[1:01:33] <%ThatOneGameTester> <3 @QueequegTheater
[1:01:36] <%DedlokPM> Timestop
[1:01:38] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat get that big brain and get my favorite spell
[1:01:38] <laserbeaming> Chat, don't be meant to Queequeg
[1:01:38] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't remember how I opened that gate.
[1:01:42] <%1matheuw> brb guys
[1:01:47] <laserbeaming> Don't be mean at all
[1:01:47] <ZE_Count> jump better

[1:01:51] <Mendin> Pat what the shit
[1:01:55] <etoir> pull the lever on the right
[1:01:58] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Could the patella / kneecap be "hidden" elsewhere, or part or something else? (You have a "Toe" bead.... just a thought.
[1:02:00] <%Typhaeon> Ahab's plenty mean enough already
[1:02:14] <%RubberFistFight> jesus there's a lot of phalanges just lying around this game
[1:02:16] <%Pinkaminks> pat put on the shroud
[1:02:19] <ahmz1404> what's that infernal racket
[1:02:19] <%Crushter> @FirearmsInstructor it's later in the area
[1:02:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Kill the explosive heads near the dude?
[1:02:24] <Mendin> You had 75% of the puzzle done and then you just... walked away
[1:02:28] <%kiiiirsten> Okay I now understand this enemy
[1:02:34] <%umbypokochan> it's in your leg, just rip your leg off and take it
[1:02:36] <ZE_Count> Okay now I see the lady riding the giant.
[1:02:40] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Crushter ah ok. He has quite the collection! :)
[1:02:49] <%dukenux> Is that a whole pelvis bone
[1:02:56] <JohnA83> How's your day been Pat? I've been magnificently sick so I've been watching Netflix and the the playthrough of Bully you guys did on the old channel
[1:02:57] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat you can use the bomb heads to kill the summoner
[1:03:00] <bomfiz> @Crushter well it could give that. I just thought it was referring to certain collectibles you need to get
[1:03:02] <KitsuneManami> @AngriestPat are you actually gonna play FO4?
[1:03:07] <%moogleboy1984> 4Head
[1:03:08] <atravelbee> Pat what did you think of the Giant babeh boss? @AngriestPat

[1:03:15] <%RubberFistFight> @dukenux well the pelvis is a single bone with a few cartilage articulation points.

[1:04:16] <carzeri> dude the soundtrack of this game is nuts, love it
[1:04:18] <etoir> you have to pull the right lever, open the door, then navigate back when the door is open

[1:18:50] <%dukenux> ???
[1:18:50] <+lilgarbage_> Hit the babby
[1:18:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Holy shit, you didn't die.
[1:18:50] <worldbrand> can you spell those?
[1:18:50] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat remember that key in "i have no mouth and i must scream" that did absolutely nothing and went to no door?
[1:18:50] <Dementedpenguin> those were some tasty sound bites Kappa
[1:18:51] <ahmz1404> now he learns
[1:18:53] <Mendin> So there's 4 blue candles, you only need 3
[1:18:53] <+Roundelay11> use vertical magic

[1:19:11] <Kiraklene> SICK
[1:19:11] <+SamleyTimes> pointless candle
[1:19:11] <%Sol_Install> that was extreme
[1:19:11] <Pyrenity> Yeah!
[1:19:14] <%RubberFistFight> So you just turned that child to dust, no biggy.
[1:19:14] <worldbrand> hey!
[1:19:16] <deviljhojho94> YEAH
[1:19:24] <%floralkami> @angriestpat remember to duck
[1:19:26] <SlimeSlimeSlime> They wrote the name right!
[1:19:29] <%moogleboy1984> creepy = 10/10
[1:19:30] <worldbrand> okay
[1:19:32] <%dukenux> You may keep your puppets, or you may keep your kneecaps Kappa
[1:19:34] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Kneecap of Sea-Bass.
[1:19:36] <%ogtrashwizard> That's some Junji Ito shit there
[1:19:36] <%RubberFistFight> I wonder if they didn't know the real name of that bone...
[1:19:37] <%Crushter> it's so rare that you get a Sebastien
[1:19:37] <deviljhojho94> OOF
[1:19:40] <%AbnormalVoid> "Hey, puppets, better not move!"
[1:19:42] <Dementedpenguin> Damn
[1:19:43] <%Hydrapissed> Cover art
[1:19:43] <%RubberFistFight> since they get all the other names right
[1:19:46] <ahmz1404> the animations in this game are sick
[1:19:48] <%Typhaeon> See? They saw "paella" and got hungry
[1:19:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> What a good goddam kill.
[1:20:01] <WarchiefGoldva> ...Spinel?
[1:20:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I want more games with BRUTAL and METAL executions.
[1:20:09] <AdmiralButtloaf> nobody likes a moving puppet
[1:20:09] <Smart_ZaK1> Kick his ass, seabass
[1:20:15] <%RubberFistFight> @Typhaeon yo to be fair though paella's fucken tasty as fuck.
[1:20:15] <ZE_Count> Man Conehead Jesus is pretty brutal.
[1:20:15] <Ominnous> fervent?
[1:20:19] <ahmz1404> remember sword heart
[1:20:19] <%Crushter> @King_Wolf_Rigger if Elden Ring doesn't have Glory Kills I'll be sad
[1:20:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> To be fair if my puppets tarted moving I'd burn down the building as well
[1:20:24] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat talk to him again after this
[1:20:25] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat MAke sure to have the sword item removed
[1:20:27] <%dukenux> kissu kissu
[1:20:30] <Tucker0603> need full fervor probably
[1:20:30] <Mendin> Hey while you're here, show Foot Pope your hand
[1:20:31] <%Typhaeon> Indeed
[1:20:32] <%Pinkaminks> talk to him again pat
[1:20:33] <%Laecerelius> Big money!
[1:20:33] <deviljhojho94> damn thats a lot of money
[1:20:37] <%moogleboy1984> 10k bills
[1:20:38] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> there's no easy way to fill up fervor is there?
[1:20:39] <worldbrand> Wow that was everything you just spent
[1:20:40] <deviljhojho94> you recovered it all
[1:20:46] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> 10,000 sluls jeez
[1:20:47] <%Pinkaminks> ah, you're missing an item
[1:20:47] <%RubberFistFight> dollar dollar bills y'all
[1:20:47] <moragtang> Remember when Jesus took that guy's candelabra and stabbed him with it?
[1:20:48] <%Crushter> wait
[1:20:48] <deviljhojho94> time is convoluted
[1:20:49] <Mendin> Self-cutting, Hunk
[1:20:49] <WarchiefGoldva> @AngriestPat If you hold the ranged bottan, you do big self-damage for big fervor juice.
[1:20:52] <%Agami23> time to get that bile vial
[1:20:54] <Trash_leviathan> what do tears do
[1:20:58] <worldbrand> "In sundowns, we need not contemplate" god if that isn't the truth
[1:20:59] <%Crushter> did he miss an ingredient?
[1:21:03] <deviljhojho94> tears are what the coins are called
[1:21:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Crushter Dude, if Elden Ring has executions, it will de facto be the best FromSoft game.
[1:21:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Pinkaminks Hi Pinky :)
[1:21:04] <Mendin> Tears are souls
[1:21:05] <%Pinkaminks> Yeah he had to of
[1:21:06] <%moogleboy1984> tears is money
[1:21:08] <%Pinkaminks> sup
[1:21:08] <+SamleyTimes> @AngriestPat progress more, then come back to him
[1:21:11] <%dalmek> you might be missing an item for him, then
[1:21:12] <ahmz1404> has anyone found the Bust Carved in Ivory yet?
[1:21:13] <sulkysulko> keep talking to him
[1:21:14] <%FirearmsInstructor> "Sundown"?
[1:21:16] <%moogleboy1984> because they thought you gave him all the ingredients
[1:21:19] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Show the water guy your hand
[1:21:20] <%gespenst25> the flow of Lordran is convoluted?
[1:21:20] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Wash them more!
[1:21:20] <%moogleboy1984> you're still missing 2
[1:21:25] <LodiFrostbeard> chat is always wrong
[1:21:25] <%valriot> show peninse
[1:21:32] <Smart_ZaK1> You need more items
[1:21:35] <%Crushter> thought he got em all
[1:21:38] <%AncelDeLambert> Bearer Seek Seek Lest
[1:21:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Cool
[1:21:45] <%Crushter> ...........but there's only six
[1:21:48] <ZE_Count> 8 is a holy number
[1:21:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> How far along into the game is Pat? (Main quest line)
[1:21:55] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> now speak to Giga Clemps
[1:21:57] <%kiiiirsten> Gross
[1:21:59] <%Pinkaminks> hes gotta get the 3 masks
[1:22:03] <%DedlokPM> Show feet
[1:22:04] <%Pinkaminks> I dont think he has any
[1:22:07] <+SamleyTimes> @AngriestPat theres only 6. Its possible to talk to him too early to receive big reward
[1:22:08] <Mendin> He has 1
[1:22:18] <jimmytwofeet> @AngriestPat Hello fellow gamer
[1:22:21] <%Crushter> @Pinkaminks oh do you need all masks to get the knot too
[1:22:23] <%kiiiirsten> BAD HAND give, GOOD HAND get
[1:22:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> whoa, foot fetish paradise
[1:22:32] <+poobus> is this dark souls for super nintendo
[1:22:34] <%Pinkaminks> Dont think so
[1:22:38] <+ThePandoran94> kill 2 more bosses than talk to him again
[1:22:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Maaaaaaaaan, so many games are made in the old style with such mastercraft nowadays. Imagine getting games like this during the SNES era? They would've been carved in time forever as legendary games.
[1:22:45] <ミュウレ4242> groovy.
[1:22:47] <%Pinkaminks> But I didnt re-talk to him till way after I handed in everything
[1:22:49] <%dukenux> Kira wept
[1:22:53] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Just to save ti me, it will -always- ring in Albero, it's a bug
[1:22:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> whats the lore?
[1:22:59] <haisho> so it plays THAT music whenever a mystery is about huh
[1:23:09] <moragtang> The reason they're mastercrafts is precisely because they're made today tho
[1:23:24] <lilfrazzy> @SlimeSlimeSlime i agree
[1:23:24] <haisho> no I'm making a dumb joke about mysteries
[1:23:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @SlimeSlimeSlime Someone still makes games for the Sega platforms and they are killer.
[1:23:28] <+poobus> oh boy! albero
[1:23:28] <ahmz1404> it's for the secret wall
[1:23:33] <Coystick> But why does it play the bell in Albero
[1:23:33] <%Pinkaminks> he gives you the last knot for the rosary
[1:23:37] <+poobus> best beef jerky imo
[1:23:38] <Ominnous> @DesuDesuDokiDoki for some reason everyone's guilt manifested into blessings or curses into tangible beings or events and now the world is a crazy hellish catholic nightmare
[1:23:41] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat no, kill two more bosses then come back I guess
[1:23:42] <Coystick> there's no secret left there surely
[1:23:46] <ミュウレ4242> they aren't mastercrafts. modern tools and hardware are cheating.
[1:23:58] <%moogleboy1984> @DesuDesuDokiDoki People are sad because Sin, woman beats a symbol of God against her chest until a sword comes out of it, she turns to stone, your dude grabs the sword and has to serve penitence for being alive
[1:24:03] <%aeravon> That costs money, stop
[1:24:04] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @King_Wolf_Rigger I gotta look that up ASAP.
[1:24:07] <ahmz1404> dont forget the unequip swordheart
[1:24:08] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SlimeSlimeSlime Can you imagine fitting all this onto a ROM? I don't even think it could contain the voice acting... but yea... not to mention it would have set a high bar and we would be that much farther along into game evolution etc :)
[1:24:08] <WarchiefGoldva> Dude does an incomplete sudoku.
[1:24:13] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> sick
[1:24:42] <%Pinkaminks> yeah, its easier to go from the library because of the spike pits
[1:24:43] <SlimeSlimeSlime> @FirearmsInstructor Can't argue with any of that. :)
[1:24:47] <%Crushter> @Ominnous it's not for no reason, the silver mask guy says early on that he beckoned the miracle down
[1:24:52] <Coystick> The library of n words
[1:24:58] <+poobus> oh it''s also a metroidvania
[1:24:58] <%moogleboy1984> also, Jesus turned into a tree because lolmiracles, and Olive Oil sets fire to women
[1:25:11] <%RubberFistFight> spikepits wanna deal with you though Pat.
[1:25:32] <Ominnous> @Crushter It's not really for no reason, it's just unclear until the later events of the game, so I didn't bother disclosing why to someone new to the game
[1:25:44] <+poobus> is that william shakespeare's head?
[1:25:46] <%king_wragles> so that bell is part of the music right?
[1:25:49] <%Crushter> @Ominnous oh sorry, that was me assuming :x u right
[1:25:52] <WarchiefGoldva> The Miracle doesn't care if what it gives is good or bad. If you want to die, it'll kill you horribly. If you want to save people, it'll make your kisses magical.
[1:26:07] <%moogleboy1984> @poobus I assume it's a representation of Dantalion
[1:26:10] <%king_wragles> aaahhh, that is really quiet
[1:26:18] <+poobus> Francis Bacon?
[1:26:24] <Mendin> I'd just check after the next boss
[1:26:28] <alexandrecau> So is your guy on the Miracle side or try to fight it
[1:26:32] <%Pinkaminks> If you mean the rosary knot thing, chances are you just gotta progress and then try again
[1:26:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SlimeSlimeSlime It's actually fascinating... because of the extreme cost of hardware before, it was literally like an art form to be as absolutely and completely efficient with your code and resulting compiled program size. Nowadays hardware is cheap, and things can be sloppy and bloated, but still beautiful.
[1:26:34] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat apparently you might need to kill a boss for it trigger
[1:26:38] <+Surf_Zombie> Yo, I remember this kickstarter! Looks dope
[1:26:39] <%moogleboy1984> you're fine Pat
[1:26:41] <Mendin> @alexandrecau God only knows.
[1:27:18] <%zamzoph> @SamleyTimes Kreygasm
[1:27:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Everyone got something during the miracle
[1:27:21] <%valriot> General Grevious miracle
[1:27:21] <Coystick> I dunno I kicked my toe today that was pretty bad
[1:27:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> jesus didn't turn into a tree. he cursed a tree so it wouldn't give up any more fruit when it didn't have figs. but he never turned into a tree.
[1:27:25] <%moogleboy1984> > gives you the knot
[1:27:27] <%RantingRavager> Just do 100 hail marys and you'll be fine
[1:27:27] <ミュウレ4242> where's alucard when you need him?
[1:27:29] <%Crushter> the Miracle is ambivalent, it gives grace and curses those. If you ask for punishment, it will give it, if your plea is empassioned enough
[1:27:32] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SlimeSlimeSlime Nevertheless, I still appreciate the little tricks and clever things they did to maximize and squeeze every last bit, byte, and nibble out of the available resources that were available to them. :)
[1:27:33] <%moogleboy1984> lenny.png
[1:27:33] <haisho> wow library ninjas
[1:27:33] <atravelbee> F U C K O
[1:27:36] <Mendin> ALucard is working in another library
[1:27:39] <WarchiefGoldva> The Miracle is the worst thing, but the people are what truly escalate it into nightmare hellscape.
[1:27:41] <haisho> I knew there was something fishy about em
[1:27:44] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@SamleyTimes) (warning)
[1:27:50] <%RubberFistFight> oof
[1:27:50] <deviljhojho94> tomatoKnife tomatoKnife MrDestructoid tomatoKnife tomatoKnife Grievous miracle
[1:27:57] <+SamleyTimes> LUL
[1:28:00] <alexandrecau> I mean the character you play is following the faith or blaspheming right now?
[1:28:00] <%dukenux> General Kenobi
[1:28:08] <%kiiiirsten> big bell for big boys
[1:28:11] <moragtang> Depends on who you ask.
[1:28:12] <sonofthedeepsouth> THE MIRACLE DID NOTHING WRONG
[1:28:14] <%Crushter> @alexandrecau he's blaspheming because he's going against the church
[1:28:15] <Mendin> A Penitent One implies you are seeking forgiveness for your sins
[1:28:27] <deviljhojho94> that cone hat also implies it
[1:28:32] <%Pinkaminks> the bell isn't useful if you just use a 100% map
[1:28:33] <ZE_Count> Im trying to figure this lore out the miracle can give ya kinda super powers but also make ya super fucked up right?
[1:28:36] <alexandrecau> @Crushter but some of the church guy like him
[1:28:38] <%moogleboy1984> the hand was the last thing I got for my 100%, which is why I made sure to point it out to you
[1:28:45] <Ominnous> stagger weapon
[1:28:50] <%moogleboy1984> it's in such an out of the way place that it's super easy to miss it
[1:28:54] <Ominnous> get it, cause it's a stag
[1:28:55] <%Crushter> @alexandrecau only the people not part of the System, people in the Mother of Mothers, etc don't
[1:29:05] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat you have to take the heart of the sword out at a shrine
[1:29:05] <%kiiiirsten> Idle animations don't count
[1:29:08] <deviljhojho94> lets ssee what happens
[1:29:10] <lilfrazzy> @FirearmsInstructor i feel like if this level of game design was achievable back then the indie scene would be full of polygonal styled games instead of 8-16 bit styled games lol
[1:29:11] <%dukenux> PogChamp
[1:29:11] <atravelbee> N I C E

[1:29:18] <%Laecerelius> You did it!
[1:29:19] <+lilgarbage_> MASSIVE BRAIN
[1:29:19] <haisho> watch it close as he puts all his shit on
[1:29:21] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[1:29:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> this is the kinda puzzle I like
[1:29:23] <%moogleboy1984> Grape
[1:29:23] <%Crushter> @alexandrecau for example, Esdras, the guy you fight on the bridge is part of the Anointed Legion, guards to the Pope
[1:29:23] <+TheImmortal70> @ZE_Count Nope, it makes manifest your guilts. Folks who want to be pious and take others suffering or what have you will be horrifically transformed by the Grievous Miracle, just like they want.
[1:29:24] <%dukenux> BELIEVE IT
[1:29:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat apatBig apatDab
[1:29:26] <+SamleyTimes> i think hes doing the Miracles dirty work? idk
[1:29:27] <%RubberFistFight> apatBig success
[1:29:28] <%Diabetic> Is Goth Metal Jesus happy now?
[1:29:30] <%sl8r4l8r> HOW DID YOU DO THAT?!?!
[1:29:38] <%moogleboy1984> spaels
[1:29:38] <ahmz1404> was there a room around here with an annoying banging sound?
[1:29:39] <%Rakenshin> BIG numbers
[1:29:40] <%dukenux> It's a miracle Kappa
[1:29:49] <%kiiiirsten> ITS BLUUD
[1:29:52] <%Crushter> its an okay miracle, you leave DoT clouds
[1:29:53] <%Pinkaminks> Is it just me or is this the worst prayer?
[1:29:55] <WarchiefGoldva> The Miracle isn't like a monkey's paw. It is simply detached from thoughts. If you WANT punishment and suffering, it WILL give it to you. If you want to save lives, it WILL give you the means to do so.
[1:29:56] <%moogleboy1984> is gud blud
[1:29:56] <moragtang> haha it's a bloody fart
[1:29:57] <+SamleyTimes> FART CLOUD
[1:29:59] <%valriot> BLOOD VAPE PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[1:30:01] <%hntronium> amen
[1:30:01] <Coystick> Damn I suck at this game all secrets missed
[1:30:04] <EVA_Unit02> Unlimited Blade Works
[1:30:10] <+TheImmortal70> It require your entire bar holy shit
[1:30:12] <%rubbishbinge> I am the bone of my blood
[1:30:13] <%dukenux> CRIMSON CLOOOT
[1:30:14] <AdmiralButtloaf> Hollow Knight stink cloud
[1:30:17] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so it's basically that charm from Hollow Knight that makes you stinky with the poop cloud
[1:30:21] <deviljhojho94> hell of a thing baby
[1:30:22] <atravelbee> time for BAB
[1:30:23] <%moogleboy1984> he has no spell equipped KappaRoss
[1:30:24] <Smart_ZaK1> Crimson Kush
[1:30:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Only the most soulless individuals could figure out these puzzles.
[1:30:27] <cosmicgoatee> Defenders crest fart huh
[1:30:33] <%Crushter> Socorro is the best example of the Miracle doing a good, but in a visibly terrible way
[1:30:34] <Mendin> She's in that small room due left
[1:30:39] <LodiFrostbeard> near the portal
[1:30:43] <Mendin> In the gallery
[1:30:45] <deviljhojho94> the sword beam-o or the lightning seems more useful
[1:30:47] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Whoa, I didn't know this game was a Hollow Knight. Radical.
[1:30:49] <%Pinkaminks> wonder what that sound is
[1:30:51] <ahmz1404> theres that annoying banging sound
[1:30:59] <Mendin> Directly below you
[1:31:08] <ZE_Count> So its commentary about catholic guilt?
[1:31:09] <%moogleboy1984> @Crushter Oh, Our Lady of the Impeccable Misery unto Perpetuity?
[1:31:16] <%Crushter> @moogleboy1984 yes
[1:31:21] <Mendin> Oh Big Such Yes ZE
[1:31:25] <+SamleyTimes> not really commentary
[1:31:26] <%moogleboy1984> you didn't say her full Spanish name
[1:31:33] <WarchiefGoldva> @ZE_Count Oh yes.
[1:31:38] <%FirearmsInstructor> @SlimeSlimeSlime I appreciate Mode7 for what it was, it's place in history, and occasionally get a pang of nostalgia when I see it, but I'm glad how well we've progressed... that said I (almost) always enjoy playing a game of chess before these crazy AAA titles.
[1:31:40] <+poobus> somehow getting Actraiser vibes from this game
[1:31:44] <%Crushter> She does actually protect the Paladin Guards' wounds, she prevents the wounds of prisoners, but her wounds ever grow on themselves, and burst
[1:32:10] <%Dioliciouss> Pat you are doing surprisingly well in this game
[1:32:11] <atravelbee> @ZE_Count yeah the PC is serving penance for.... living?
[1:32:17] <moragtang> So basically the Grievous Miracle is the equivalent of the D&D Wish spell. LUL
[1:32:33] <%Crushter> @moragtang it's more like petitioning a "true" angel for help
[1:32:33] <%RubberFistFight> @moragtang wow that's actually a really apropos way to sum it up.
[1:32:39] <%Kain5707> @AngriestPat what do you plan on playing to fill the AC gap now?
[1:32:39] <%WhereIsWill> games like these are right up pats alley
[1:32:50] <+Zereaux> 100% run?
[1:32:51] <deviljhojho94> overflowing with fortune
[1:32:51] <ZE_Count> Man that old lady must be rich.
[1:32:52] <IndoorSitup> Uwu
[1:32:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Big spender
[1:32:54] <deviljhojho94> hell of a thing
[1:32:57] <%Crushter> The Grevious Miracle isn't "human"
[1:33:02] <IndoorSitup> UwUwUwU
[1:33:05] <Mendin> Did you see the bag of gold and swag on her back?
[1:33:09] <deviljhojho94> schedwell
[1:33:10] <%Kain5707> oh i forgot about that :O
[1:33:14] <%InugamiTheHound> wait astral chain is over?
[1:33:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound yeah
[1:33:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> I'm gonna miss confusing you by referencing Astral chain while you are in control
[1:33:26] <cosmicgoatee> @zereaux at the rate he is going he probably will without realizing it
[1:33:29] <IndoorSitup> @inugamithehound Yeah dude
[1:33:31] <%Crushter> @ZE_Count Do you count stealing things from dying people to sell them as "rich"
[1:33:31] <Mendin> Candelaria is apparently a Gypsy of some renown and maybe power?
[1:33:31] <ZE_Count> Time for best Final Fantasy...... 8 the bess one.
[1:33:32] <%Kain5707> oh i forgot about Surge 2
[1:33:35] <ahmz1404> i like using the rising up attack and then doing a plunging attack
[1:33:36] <%FirearmsInstructor> WTF is Surge 2? Code Vein?? Not heard of either of these.
[1:33:38] <%InugamiTheHound> @King_Wolf_Rigger damn I missed the final part
[1:33:39] <+SamleyTimes> paige ruined it :)
[1:33:42] <%Big_Dream> ff 8 sucks
[1:33:43] <%valriot> Code Vein LUL LUL
[1:33:44] <%FirearmsInstructor> @doc_ock_rokc hey man
[1:33:44] <Equirah> @AngriestPat popping the second vial doens't heal you for more
[1:33:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter so it's trying to do good but because it lacks a human perspective it's unknowingly visiting misery and pain on people?
[1:33:46] <+poobus> @AngriestPat are you hyped for the FFXIV Nier raid?
[1:33:47] <+CaptainGrime> @InugamiTheHound hes only done the main content not the post game
[1:33:50] <%AbnormalVoid> first look at the schedule, then throw it away, cause it means nothing Kappa
[1:33:51] <RaccoonBoy> Pat September has only 30 days wtf?
[1:33:56] <%DeltascapeV4> eww
[1:33:57] <ミュウレ4242> somnium files is out.
[1:33:58] <Equirah> *doesn'
[1:33:58] <%Pinkaminks> where is he going?
[1:34:04] <deviljhojho94> here's hoping surge 2 is better
[1:34:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @InugamiTheHound I have the vod up and ready to play because I also missed it.
[1:34:05] <+Zereaux> pats getting a tatoo and hes gonna stream it
[1:34:06] <Equirah> fucking hell
[1:34:08] <WarchiefGoldva> The Miracle is just a phenomenon that does things. It's just that people are terrible and wish for stupid things, like the boy that wanted to get strangled by a tree because he felt guilty of something.
[1:34:12] <ahmz1404> go back
[1:34:13] <%moogleboy1984> @FirearmsInstructor The Surge 2 is Machine Souls
[1:34:13] <%miguelrod777> Surge 2? that hasn't been marketed at all holy shit
[1:34:17] <ape_hawk> or as we like to call them: robot dark souls and anime dark souls
[1:34:18] <%solidousstream> code vein gonna be terrible so glad I preordered it
[1:34:19] <%InugamiTheHound> @CaptainGrime what was end of the main game?
[1:34:20] <Mendin> He's going for that sweet BLUD
[1:34:25] <+Roundelay11> you forgot the place to the right of the painting guy
[1:34:26] <IndoorSitup> @angriestpat You gonna be streaming Code Vein? Looks like some anime ass shit.
[1:34:28] <fazoburquina> has pat seen the bull yet?
[1:34:30] <%Crushter> @RubberFistFight it's the power of GOD itself, YHWH style, the Father and the Mother once interpreted god's will but they gone now
[1:34:35] <%Pinkaminks> Oh, bile vessel, right
[1:34:37] <%Agami23> @fazoburquina yeah
[1:34:38] <cosmicgoatee> Astral chains end plus that last costume pretty much seal the deal
[1:34:39] <Smart_ZaK1> He saw the bull
[1:34:42] <%ScreamLord> Throw the book at 'im!
[1:34:43] <ahmz1404> Code Vein is the worst animated game i've ever seen
[1:34:44] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter oh dear. Yeah, that's a bad time for everyone.
[1:34:45] <%dukenux> Pat's getting a tattoo? Is it a full back one of RCPD map?
[1:34:48] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Quick rundown / premise about Surge 2 & Code Vein?
[1:34:52] <IndoorSitup> Yea boiiii
[1:34:54] <%Crushter> @WarchiefGoldva actually he brought a log with him, so the Miracle punished him by turning him into a Tree that bleeds molten gold
[1:34:56] <%Agami23> i hope you enjoy code vein. the beta was pretty fun
[1:34:56] <foreverN2dust> I heard the character creator for it was pretty swanky
[1:34:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I see FFVII and fuckin Destiny in the schedule.
[1:35:03] <%Svanyr> Cant wait to spend hours making anime waifus
[1:35:07] <Equirah> Code Vein is traaaash, that team hasn't learned anything in decades
[1:35:10] <%rumtumtugnutz> he has two days scheduled to play the vampire waif game
[1:35:12] <ahmz1404> this room has a secret
[1:35:14] <%Starlight_Gamer> how many pit deaths today?
[1:35:15] <%dukenux> Sounds cooler than it was
[1:35:16] <%Calek> anime Vampires
[1:35:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> VAMPIRE anime
[1:35:20] <+lilgarbage_> Weeb Souls
[1:35:20] <Coystick> Anime gas masks waifus
[1:35:21] <%shurtal> HARD anime
[1:35:21] <%Zombrocom> And vampires
[1:35:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> vampire waifus
[1:35:22] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat but Dark Souls IS anime
[1:35:23] <%Pinkaminks> I believe 3 pit deaths
[1:35:24] <haisho> Code Vein is Dark Souls meets God Eater apparently
[1:35:24] <%gunzerkingdunce> Anime and tiddy
[1:35:24] <WarchiefGoldva> @Crushter Yes, but the Miracle wouldn't have done that if he didn't ask for it.
[1:35:26] <Baka_Shinji17> I love the taste of Surge.
[1:35:27] <%moogleboy1984> Simmons: "AAAAAAAANIMAAAAAYYYYYY"
[1:35:28] <%dukenux> waifu that Succ
[1:35:29] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat Are you excited about Shadowkeep? I'm super hyped
[1:35:30] <+NekoNinja13> I possed about code Vein because that game got the god eater devs and God eater 3 suffered because of it
[1:35:30] <ahmz1404> this one
[1:35:31] <%Agami23> its tokyo ghoul but souls like
[1:35:32] <zipfile777> DS IS anime
[1:35:32] <+Zereaux> your gonna not like cod vein
[1:35:33] <suikudo> Code vein is just really really bad god eater
[1:35:34] <%Big_Dream> ANIME!!!!!
[1:35:36] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Can't wait for Code Vein
[1:35:37] <+poobus> does it have bigtiddygothgfs
[1:35:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @zamzoph SHHHH

[1:35:41] <ahmz1404> that bangingnoise... make it stop
[1:35:41] <corepercentlives> code vein demo was ehhh
[1:35:41] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You're frighteningly concise with your responses, lol.
[1:35:42] <%Kain5707> are you more excited for Surge or Vein?
[1:35:43] <%rubbishbinge> dat job syste
[1:35:46] <%solidousstream> @angriestpat so many bluud waifus
[1:35:47] <%Pinkaminks> pat pls
[1:35:48] <%rubbishbinge> system*
[1:35:50] <%AbnormalVoid> BWOOONG
[1:35:52] <%sirisvirus> nope
[1:35:53] <%dalmek> you are incredibly wrong on that
[1:35:55] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Everything is Dark Souls. I believe Miyazaki will be revered like Kojima in the near future.
[1:35:55] <%TheBitingIrish> La li lu le lo
[1:35:55] <SnazzyRazz> I like the idea that the miracle is just giving these people what they ask for and the religion is what ruined everyone's day
[1:36:00] <%Crushter> @WarchiefGoldva he asked for Punishment, the Miracle interprets a punishment from the things around him
[1:36:10] <ahmz1404> remember the guy that wanted you to stop an annoying racket?
[1:36:12] <foreverN2dust> mountain dew code vein or surge, hard choice
[1:36:26] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat so there's a game set to come out next year called "Carrion" - it's billed as a "reverse horror game" and one of my regulars summed it up as "It's a game where you play as John Carpenter's The Thing". Sounds pretty interesting, there's been a little bit of gameplay footage showed here and there.
[1:36:29] <%Crushter> @SnazzyRazz the religion got high on its own fumes, basically, that's how we got here
[1:36:35] <etoir> SS
[1:36:40] <Astaroth130> that was pretty sweet
[1:36:41] <worldbrand> i wasnt looking do it again
[1:36:42] <SnazzyRazz> I mean the kissers of wounds just wanted to help people and then they could kiss boo boo better
[1:36:46] <atravelbee> BA-BY
[1:36:50] <%moogleboy1984> this fucking Eva pisses me off
[1:36:52] <foreverN2dust> the animations in this look so good
[1:36:55] <%Kiiper> @RubberFistFight We watched the devolver conference together he knows
[1:36:55] <%Laecerelius> abastract daddy does big damage
[1:36:55] <%TheBitingIrish> But is Carrion an asymmetric multiplayer?
[1:36:57] <+poobus> blyat
[1:36:59] <atravelbee> BA-BY!
[1:37:03] <%Crushter> Yeah but the Order itself, the Church is what kind of fugged up stuff
[1:37:04] <moragtang> They talked about Carrion a while back in the podcast iirc.
[1:37:11] <cosmicgoatee> POG
[1:37:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @foreverN2dust I prefer Surge to Mountain Dew, but Jolt was the best lol.
[1:37:18] <%RubberFistFight> @Kiiper oh yeah that's right LUL My memory's shitty sometimes.
[1:37:18] <%FirearmsInstructor> LOL
[1:37:20] <%dalmek> @RubberFistFight Pat showed interest when he saw the video for it on the "Devolver Direct" for E3, but yeah it seems neato

[1:38:28] <Smart_ZaK1> That thing looks like Koh from Avatar
[1:38:28] <%derekwst3> that's not a snake

[1:38:37] <suikudo> i read that as scion of abortion
[1:38:38] <%StaceMcGate> Exposito = Despacito
[1:38:39] <Mendin> @Engwithan_Elder_God Oh that's where you're wrong
[1:38:39] <%ThatRandomGuy661> Despacito, the Boss Baby
[1:38:39] <atravelbee> MY CATHOLIC GUILT FEELS GOOD WITH THIS IMAGERY

[1:38:42] <%derekwst3> its the umberical cord
[1:38:42] <+TheImmortal70> This boss is a super joke
[1:38:44] <Coystick> That style of sprite animation on the snake is so unsettling
[1:38:44] <%millamoks> @AngriestPat Thats probably its umbilical cord or something
[1:38:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Engwithan_Elder_God buckle up THERE IS MORE

[1:39:13] <+TheImmortal70> It's not that the attack is op, the boss has a very clear weak point on it's midsection that takes like 300% damage so it's trivialized

[1:39:15] <%AbnormalVoid> I wanna see Pat get ripped in half
[1:39:16] <Mister_McDerp> tiny?

[1:39:20] <Mendin> This is a lt of peoples' hard-ass boss
[1:39:21] <$TheYharnamTheorem> Gotta respect how far these devs went with their grim vision. Love how horrific and potentially offensive their art is.

[1:47:52] <+poobus> what's the name of the font in this game? I'm really digging it
[1:47:56] <%Big_Dream> so what his alignment now
[1:48:03] <+poobus> very Enix
[1:48:04] <%FirearmsInstructor> About how many hours is this game on average?
[1:48:07] <%Dakuu75> alignment: Jesus
[1:48:17] <Mendin> 12-15
[1:48:17] <%moogleboy1984> @FirearmsInstructor to get through? about 10-15
[1:48:17] <moragtang> game length varies from 8 to 20+ hours.
[1:48:23] <%king_wragles> @poobus so the weird thing is that most fonts are licensed and copy righted. So it's probably a custom job
[1:48:27] <WarchiefGoldva> Big Jesus.
[1:48:27] <%moogleboy1984> to 100% is more like 20ish
[1:48:28] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor people are averaging between about 15 and 20 depending on ability and whether they're a completionist or not.
[1:48:36] <LandOfTheWay> !uptime

[1:48:58] <LandOfTheWay> so what's pat done so far?
[1:49:02] <%king_wragles> @DesuDesuDokiDoki I'm surprised that no one has made that joke yet.
[1:49:08] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat any hype for Shadowkeep? The last vidoc got me really excited

[1:49:23] <ahmz1404> what about the guy with the library quest?
[1:49:30] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat why you need this hand of the fraternal master
[1:49:31] <%Dakuu75> the ledge grabbing is just a smidge off-kilter
[1:49:32] <Mendin> @Ultimatefool Depends on the MP cost of the spell equipped, shows how many casts he can do
[1:49:40] <%king_wragles> I should hit level 50.... but Warframe....
[1:49:41] <ZE_Count> guess another boss?
[1:49:42] <%dalmek> @Ultimatefool uses depend on the spell. He has an EXPENSIVE spell on
[1:49:47] <SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat any plans to play Daemon x machina, mechs are cool...
[1:49:48] <%GarbageNirvana> I'm gonna have to see what Shadowkeep looks like before I pick it up
[1:49:48] <%FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight Well you are shit tier so that makes complete sense. ;P

[1:57:48] <MapleFlapjack> Yeah
[1:57:50] <sonofthedeepsouth> Yeah Pat kill those kids
[1:57:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat A 10mg OTC tab might be just enough to offset the Elmo-spores. I suffered pretty bad, but it seriously does help.
[1:57:54] <MapleFlapjack> This is the game with the brutal death animations
[1:57:57] <moragtang> There's one for No Context Pat.
[1:57:58] <MattDemers> I enjoy how brutal these executions are
[1:57:59] <sonofthedeepsouth> JUST STOMP THE ALTAR BOYS
[1:57:59] <%RubberFistFight> I love how that execution is basically the Penitent One going "COME HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT"
[1:58:00] <ZE_Count> Wonder if you could use health potion immunity to dodge them?
[1:58:03] <Ominnous> this is all because of the ladies pat is into

[1:59:10] <%valriot> Vaati Pog
[1:59:11] <sonofthedeepsouth> Vaati will soon do a video
[1:59:11] <%miguelrod777> pour out crack and SMOKE it
[1:59:14] <atravelbee> @miguelrod777 yeah your nose would be too clogged to inhale spores lol

[1:59:18] <%Laecerelius> Push less rope, use more linen

[1:59:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> *Larry the Cable Guy Prilosec noises*
[1:59:23] <%floralkami> @doc_ock_rokc so never
[1:59:27] <%valriot> This game probably banned in Australia
[1:59:29] <%RubberFistFight> @doc_ock_rokc man, I tried to like that game, I tried SO HARD, but I found it uncomfortably un-fun.
[1:59:33] <+nekodelic> Vaati making a video about this would be a mix of lore and history
[1:59:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat LORATADINE 10mg is what I take. Combats my friend's cat's death grip on me. It's just a generic antihistamine that you can get from whatever chain drugstores you have up in CA. It's like $0.50 / day or something to not suffer and be able to breathe.
[1:59:38] <cosmicgoatee> Get Mossbag and Vaati to team up
[1:59:44] <%floralkami> CONSUME PRILOSEC
[1:59:46] <+Mitchellsocks> You can tell when there's no active Souls news when Vaati posts: Why Demon's Souls Needs A Remaster
[1:59:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> Catholics be like this game explain the lorw to much
[1:59:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @floralkami oh yee of little faith
[1:59:56] <%Punchasaur> vaati reads the Bible
[2:00:15] <moragtang> Man's gotta make content from something.
[2:00:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Anti-histemines have no effect on me anymore.
[2:00:17] <%Pinkaminks> I wish we were getting Sekiro DLC
[2:00:21] <%RubberFistFight> @FirearmsInstructor My missus can't take that, it makes her super sleepy. she takes 10mg Cetirizine instead.
[2:00:22] <VeryTricky> did pat beat the game
[2:00:23] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat it is
[2:00:27] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I scoffed at it for years but now it's seriously beneficial. Please give it a shot sometime. I'm sure it'll help.
[2:00:27] <+SamleyTimes> Vaati bible series PogChamp
[2:00:32] <ahmz1404> you can drop into all the abyss areas now
[2:00:37] <+SamleyTimes> SAME
[2:00:39] <%dukenux> i wish we were getting DMC V dlc
[2:00:40] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> why?
[2:00:42] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat You don't wanna fight Tomoe?
[2:00:44] <%moogleboy1984> I want a sequel to Sekiro more than DLC
[2:00:45] <%valriot> Sekiro was bad
[2:00:47] <sonofthedeepsouth> SEKIRO IGNORED
[2:00:48] <%king_wragles> Sekiro is getting DLC?
[2:00:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> I need to play sekiro
[2:00:51] <+Mitchellsocks> Vaati just reading bible passages on a chapter per video basis
[2:00:52] <asurite_warrior> didnt you love that game when you were playing it?
[2:00:53] <%Punchasaur> yeah cuz you suck 4Head
[2:00:57] <ahmz1404> the ones with the hazey stuff int he pits
[2:00:58] <%waltzqueen> i also ignored sekiro
[2:01:00] <%GarbageNirvana> What if they found a way to fix the whatsits you hate
[2:01:00] <%Dakuu75> @VeryTricky this game? no, he's like... 40-50% into it I think
[2:01:01] <a_mad_dragon> the elevator shafts
[2:01:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> @RubberFistFight Yea some people have weird reactions. There's different formulations if you have an adverse (ie sleepy) response to it.
[2:01:03] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat I actually helped Vaati in a very small and minor way during one of his Sekiro streams I brought to his attention the Japanese/Chinese Legend about Carp that can become Dragons by jumping through the Dragon Gate at the top of a Waterfall
[2:01:04] <atravelbee> @AngriestPat did you ever beat Nioh? just killed Hawk man Mercenary guy tonight
[2:01:07] <+Mitchellsocks> ! SEKIRO AT RISK !
[2:01:08] <%Big_Dream> skeiro wasn't bad
[2:01:08] <+Roundelay11> death pits that have mist floating on them
[2:01:10] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat you already did the one in Olive Tree so you only have the Rooftop and the Sewer Elevator
[2:01:10] <%sirrice77> bottomless pit areas, the places with fog
[2:01:10] <worldbrand> I felt like i got everything I wanted in sekiro
[2:01:11] <carzeri> i want sekiro dlc so much. one of the best games i have ever played
[2:01:13] <deltakuma009> the art style reminds me of that one point and click you and woolie played for a shitstorm a long while back
[2:01:15] <ZE_Count> can you survive that elevator drop now?
[2:01:17] <%floralkami> Sekiro is disappointing in the face of all these other new games
[2:01:19] <RogerPoore> @AngriestPat Is Sekiro worse than Dark Souls 2?
[2:01:25] <+SamleyTimes> sekiro was forgettable
[2:01:28] <carzeri> sekiro is goty and its not even close
[2:01:30] <%Pinkaminks> Sekiro is the 2nd best fromsoft game.
[2:01:30] <ahmz1404> theyre all over the map really
[2:01:32] <%RubberFistFight> @asurite_warrior yeah but he also said it has basically 0 replay value because there's no real "builds" like souls or bloodborne./
[2:01:32] <%firehawk_420> I love Sekiro
[2:01:35] <moragtang> @deltakuma009 Tormentum: Dark Sorrow?
[2:01:38] <%floralkami> @deltakuma009 Tormenteum
[2:01:47] <deltakuma009> yea that one
[2:01:49] <worldbrand> Wow polarized opinions in chat
[2:01:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I can take a whole day's dose of Benadryl in one go and nothing happens
[2:01:53] <%Dakuu75> @deltakuma009 Speaking of which, I wounder who has the copy-write for "Shitstorm" now

[2:02:29] <%Punchasaur> sekiro's combat made me need a second cum sock
[2:02:30] <deltakuma009> yea thats a great question
[2:02:30] <DracaenaLeaf> do it again but towards the item
[2:02:30] <%floralkami> oh, pits to to new areas now?
[2:02:31] <WarchiefGoldva> Trees are assholes.
[2:02:37] <+SamleyTimes> sekiro delivered me straight into the arms of God himself
[2:02:39] <%arcielardor> Right down to the room layouts!
[2:02:43] <Ominnous> spikes are gravity enhancers
[2:02:45] <carzeri> i want them to use the sekiro combat system for every fromsoft game from this point on including the jrr martin one
[2:02:50] <+JacktheMan18> He can fall from that ledge without dying now?
[2:02:53] <%RubberFistFight> @worldbrand Sekiro is an amazing game with some serious engine problems, like most Fromsoft games. It runs like ASS on consoles, even Pro/XboneX, and the frame timing on PC is awful as well.
[2:02:56] <%Crushter> man i hope baiken is in gg 2020
[2:02:58] <%moogleboy1984> bonez
[2:02:59] <DracaenaLeaf> yay
[2:03:03] <%InugamiTheHound> salad chalice?
[2:03:03] <moragtang> He got a relic that allows him to drop down pits.
[2:03:09] <Mendin> Most of the bottomless pit areas you've seen so far, you've legitimately unlocked/explored what's under them
[2:03:12] <%Pinkaminks> I would rather they seperate the fast paced souls games from the slower ones
[2:03:14] <%Crushter> almost got all the bones
[2:03:16] <%Katashi25> try putting the chalice down @angriestpat
[2:03:18] <%Punchasaur> @carzeri jrr Martin??
[2:03:19] <ape_hawk> oh no
[2:03:23] <ape_hawk> hes confident
[2:03:24] <buffmurffy> he's doomed
[2:03:25] <%Pinkaminks> DS3 pulling as much as it did from Bloodborne made it not good at all
[2:03:25] <%Big_King_Coconut> famous last words
[2:03:25] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:03:28] <%Crushter> that was my last boner
[2:03:29] <%moogleboy1984> rip
[2:03:30] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Sekiro does feel as replayable as Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I think after you play through it 2 or 3 times you've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer
[2:03:32] <%Piemen99> OH NO
[2:03:32] <internetexplorer11> go pat i bleve in u

[2:04:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> You get killed by Clerc

[2:04:34] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger Like I was able to clown the shit out of Sword Saint Isshin on PC, but on PS4 a solid 1/3 of your inputs get eaten and don't result in actions and I struggled to push him into second phase. Same exact boss, totally different experiences.

[2:06:01] <asurite_warrior> Pat has to lick up the bones so Paige dont steal them
[2:06:05] <Mendin> @AngriestPat The bone locations correspond to the world map, so one missing bone in the bottom-right is probably in the library or gallery, and the upper right ones are in places you likely havent gotten yet
[2:06:08] <cosmicgoatee> We're in the endgame now
[2:06:09] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Yeah, I never got to play Sekiro, since I stopped caring after DS3. Until I get to play a game of theirs and it feels good, I'm gonna keep holding off. Luckily I have friends who still enjoy them.
[2:06:12] <%ChaosAethr> Are You?

[2:06:49] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger DS:Remastered runs very well, and Scholar of the first Sin on PC also runs very nicely. DS3 is... debatable.
[2:06:52] <%Crushter> yes
[2:06:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> ???
[2:06:58] <WarchiefGoldva> Of course it's a subjective opinion, but I feel like the writing in BL3 is a passable OK. It's entertaining, and I guess that's all it has to be.

[2:07:22] <worldbrand> LUL
[2:07:33] <worldbrand> that is a hilarious problem
[2:07:35] <atravelbee> @RubberFistFight DS3 wont run higher than 1920x1080 for me like, at al
[2:07:36] <SnazzyRazz> so a slot for every bone
[2:07:37] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Is this a Paige-fetish-bone-room? D:
[2:07:44] <haisho> yes
[2:07:51] <%Ion_Laser> yes
[2:07:58] <%moogleboy1984> Does Paige call her bed The Ossuary?
[2:07:58] <cosmicgoatee> Absolutely
[2:07:59] <LodiFrostbeard> is it worth getting all the bones?
[2:08:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> neohWhat
[2:08:01] <%Zutrax> It''s not totally exact for all the bones though, for instance my last bone to find was the top right one which was somewhat in the upper middle of the map
[2:08:11] <Mendin> Oh I know eactly which one you're missing
[2:08:12] <%Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard my favorite skin, but your mileage may vary
[2:08:19] <Rayorin> what happening? good things I hope
[2:08:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Hahaha, it is debatable, yes. I just have so many issues with input delay, eaten inputs, and command stacking and it's never consistent. I think the consistency is my biggest issue.
[2:08:22] <Mendin> Check your last 5-7 bones for Phalanx of Aralcarim
[2:08:23] <%RubberFistFight> @atravelbee that's the engine lock at work. You have to install something called "souls unsqueezed" but sadly that fucks the performance for a lot of people, and runs like absolute garbage on an AMD system. Like mine. Luckily 1080p is sufficient IMHO.
[2:08:54] <cosmicgoatee> Pat do you know of the Cathedral made with and decorated with of thousands of human bones
[2:09:00] <%moogleboy1984> reasonably easy to miss
[2:09:03] <Mendin> I was looking at a bone map and thought you missed that one
[2:09:13] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat each bone slot is set to be a specific bone, is what they meant, you can compare the empty spots for a list easily
[2:09:14] <%dukenux> That's only a chapel, and it's in Czech Republic
[2:09:15] <3xgilly> M U D ER
[2:09:15] <atravelbee> @RubberFistFight cool info, im AMD as well, and yes its nice but i like utilizing my 55 inch screen as much as possible lol
[2:09:17] <ahmz1404> Pat don't forget the tall guy complaining about the noise
[2:09:19] <%moogleboy1984> a bone map? you mean a skeleton?
[2:09:20] <%Dakuu75> Dakuu75 is continuing the Gift Sub they got from Bane_Kaikyo! 
[2:09:23] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger you play on consoles or PC? I've found input honouring to be SIGNIFICANTLY more robust on PC for From games. It's probably an issue with the game communicating to the bluetooth protocols on the console.
[2:09:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> How many are you missing? Like 6?
[2:09:26] <%valriot> Crush the Bone
[2:09:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Big bone crusher
[2:09:27] <%zamzoph> crush those bones
[2:09:30] <%Agami23> paige would be proud
[2:09:30] <%Pinkaminks> most of the bones are pretty out in the open so its somewhat easy to find em all
[2:09:36] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat you uh, crushing bones huh? Just rocking it really hard on those... bones?
[2:09:37] <Mister_McDerp> crushing the bones Kreygasm
[2:09:37] <%Monkeyweed21> you have experience from Paige
[2:09:44] <%Crushter> boners
[2:09:45] <%valriot> BONE SLOT, THATS THE NEW NAME FOR COOCHIE
[2:09:46] <%Varlinator> Varlinator subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Evening Pat! How goes the game? Looks like Castlevania had a demon babby with Dark Souls!
[2:09:50] <%Diabetic> Wait, you have a bone on here Pat?
[2:09:54] <+Roundelay11> The bones give you another skin
[2:09:58] <cosmicgoatee> @dukenux but it's so cool tho Kreygasm
[2:10:03] <Rayorin> What happened to the blue bar
[2:10:04] <%dukenux> yeah it is
[2:10:14] <%valriot> Gurl lemme git in dat Sphere Grid
[2:10:18] <turqrazor> can you play this game if you aren't religious
[2:10:22] <Rayorin> there were more divisions yesterday when I went to sleep
[2:10:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight PC. I had hoped the wired controller and the brute strength of my PC would compensate. As it is, it's only marginally better.
[2:10:23] <%RubberFistFight> @atravelbee in that case you;re much better off just persevering with it in vanilla. AMD already have enough problems with games pretending they don't exist, to add in mod developers who ALSO pretend they don't exist thus compounding issues instead of negating them.
[2:10:31] <%dukenux> if anyone gets a chance to go on holiday there, its in the town of Kutna Hora
[2:10:36] <%dukenux> iirc
[2:10:44] <ahmz1404> i feel like this game is designed really intuitively
[2:10:49] <ahmz1404> with not a lot of fluff
[2:10:56] <%dukenux> buuut, i think they're renovating it now, and cleaning all the bones
[2:11:01] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[2:11:04] <atravelbee> @turqrazor yes, but it'll just feel silly instead of imparting intense guilt
[2:11:05] <%FirearmsInstructor> ?
[2:11:06] <ahmz1404> remember that room with the banging?
[2:11:11] <%Big_King_Coconut> maybe he wants you to mute the music Kappa
[2:11:12] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat you missed at least 3 ulyoth codex
[2:11:12] <copyritetm> man every time i look at this game i just love everything about its art\
[2:11:16] <%zamzoph> @ahmz1404 Kreygasm
[2:11:16] <%king_wragles> Crazy thought, but mute the music real quick?
[2:11:22] <cosmicgoatee> I hope Paige will visit the chapel of bones one day and offer spaghetti as a tithe LUL @dukenux
[2:11:28] <%Jaxnos> is pat killing babies again?
[2:11:34] <3xgilly> why are their floating ferdinand von aegir heads
[2:11:34] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger That's really weird. Maybe you've got something hogging your usb root hub resources, or some kind of background process interference. What're your system specs?
[2:11:35] <+Roundelay11> you need the talk to dead people item on i think
[2:11:38] <%Pinkaminks> is pat ever not killing babies?
[2:11:39] <Tersalus> book'd!
[2:11:40] <%Big_King_Coconut> @king_wragles we had the same thought LUL
[2:11:43] <atravelbee> @RubberFistFight i feel ya, luckilly i beat it about a month ago USURP THE FLAM
[2:11:45] <%InugamiTheHound> room banging= babies
[2:11:48] <%Jaxnos> this is fair, pink
[2:11:53] <%dukenux> Pat straight up annihilated one baby
[2:12:02] <%king_wragles> @Big_King_Coconut oh shit, I didn't even notice. At least I'm not the only crazy person here
[2:12:03] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger because Wired controller should be basically instantaneous with the lowest amount of latency and input lag.
[2:12:04] <Mendin> Hm, the missing bone is probably in the bottom-right 25% of the Mother of Mothers then
[2:12:11] <asurite_warrior> Those guys are like READ BITCH
[2:12:12] <Rosy_Joan> slap
[2:12:16] <Rayorin> Killing babies? In MY Catholic themed game? It's more likely than you think.
[2:12:17] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't understand why you have to equip 3 of the things at once instead of having them be permanent passives.
[2:12:20] <%Crushter> My third favorite boss is up next :]
[2:12:21] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you have the "Talk to the dead" item / charm / artifact on?
[2:12:27] <Jetsfantasy> Careful, those guys can read you like a book
[2:12:36] <%king_wragles> @Jetsfantasy BBOOOOOOOO
[2:12:42] <%firehawk_420> Is it just me or did that last health potion heal nothing?
[2:12:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @asurite_warrior Cue that "Read a mother fucking book" song
[2:12:52] <%RubberFistFight> @atravelbee Lord of Hollows is the only valid ending IMHO. Fuck Gwyn's legacy, that arsehole broke the world because he was afraid of the dark and too dimwitted to invent a fucking lightbulb.
[2:12:53] <+JacktheMan18> Boomerang Books doodWAT
[2:13:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Might help. Also it was @Roundelay11 Who said it, not me. I just repeated it.
[2:13:06] <haisho> library ninjas are the worst
[2:13:12] <%Punchasaur> hard read
[2:13:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Roundelay11 Good call. :)
[2:13:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight I know it's not those, but for referance I've got the old AMD powerhouse combo. FX-9590 CPU and Rx 490 GPU with 16 gigs of ram.
[2:13:16] <%Crushter> @WarchiefGoldva my best guess? Relics were originally like HK badges, big power ups limited in slot usage
[2:13:20] <%Pinkaminks> @firehawk_420 probably not just you, I often felt like id heal and get nothing from it but I never got definitive proof
[2:13:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @haisho the quietest of all ninjas
[2:13:33] <+mastertwin2> Did Pat get to the third "Lord Soul" boss yet?
[2:13:37] <%Big_King_Coconut> was that a heckin LASER GHOST?
[2:13:40] <Rayorin> woah lasers
[2:13:40] <%Crushter> @mastertwin2 nop
[2:13:41] <%Pinkaminks> not yet
[2:13:42] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Everytime you die I take a sqig of my screwdriver. So keep at it.
[2:13:47] <+mastertwin2> thx
[2:13:54] <%Big_King_Coconut> That's rad DatSheffy
[2:13:54] <Tersalus> block'd!
[2:13:58] <Calamity2007> Nova skeleton
[2:14:00] <DexterousRob> wheres the combat then
[2:14:03] <%Crushter> Third favorite, the my favorite then second favorite
[2:14:06] <DexterousRob> does anything happen in this game
[2:14:06] <haisho> is this secretly a Dr McNinja game?
[2:14:07] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Tersalus NO U D:< heh
[2:14:07] <%Crushter> excited
[2:14:10] <%king_wragles> Lazer Ghost, Coast to Coast.
[2:14:20] <Ultimatefool> @Bluwizard21 For just a SECOND, I thought you meant an actual screwdriver
[2:14:24] <Rayorin> how can you even fight the fart gas
[2:14:25] <Tersalus> @FirearmsInstructor <:O
[2:14:25] <metrying> moon2LOLE
[2:14:41] <WarchiefGoldva> I love Laser Ghost, Coast to Coast. It was my favorite show about nothing.
[2:14:44] <%Punchasaur> laser is spelled with an S you fucking troglodytes
[2:14:45] <%Pinkaminks> @Rayorin theres an item that makes you immune to poison, as well as a few beads that reduce toxin damage
[2:14:46] <haisho> it has Library Ninjas, Laser Ghosts and the library equivalent of NASAghasts
[2:14:54] <%king_wragles> @Rayorin the silver lung makes you immune to it
[2:14:58] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger ahhhh... yeah, the CPU is likely what's dragging you down there. I recently switched from an FX-8350 to a Ryzen 5 2600 and holy shit, the difference is night and day. Unfortunately the FX chips were not very well optimised and didn't multithread that well, instead sort of brute forcing their way past with processor speed instead. Not bad when they released, but quickly outpaced by software.
[2:15:01] <%king_wragles> until then, "get fuckt"
[2:15:10] <LodiFrostbeard> here but up
[2:15:12] <Rayorin> Ah thanks, @Pinkaminks and @king_wragles
[2:15:14] <shotgang86> UP
[2:15:19] <Mendin> Dig Up
[2:15:24] <%Bluwizard21> @angriest pat go to the room above it
[2:15:25] <shotgang86> go UP pat
[2:15:26] <%Pinkaminks> dig up stupid
[2:15:38] <WarchiefGoldva> How do you up when go down is easier?
[2:15:38] <%Monkeyweed21> dig up
[2:15:43] <%Crushter> pft
[2:15:49] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Baka
[2:15:50] <metrying> drop your shield dumbo
[2:15:56] <Rayorin> @AngriestPat take it like a man pat
[2:15:56] <poweruser> pierce through the heavens
[2:15:58] <%dukenux> Yeah, im a jerk and everyone loves me!
[2:15:59] <zipfile777> dab on them
[2:16:02] <%lulzysavant> apatWrong
[2:16:08] <worldbrand> dig up cutie
[2:16:11] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Stop getting hit.
[2:16:13] <%FirearmsInstructor> NO U
[2:16:14] <%zeroarturia> So apparently Daymare 1998 is out now?
[2:16:15] <Deadbulky> Any news when the FF7 lp will start back up?
[2:16:17] <buffmurffy> if you were taller you wouldnt have to dig up
[2:16:19] <%Pinkaminks> yeah its out
[2:16:26] <worldbrand> oh
[2:16:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Sure, but I have zero problems with any other game. It's only From Soft stuff that pukes all over the place lol. MHW and Nioh work great for example.
[2:16:27] <%king_wragles> OH
[2:16:30] <%Punchasaur> dig up b-baka
[2:16:30] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger that said, I use my old FX-8350 system guts as my streaming PC since it handles 720p60 well, and allows me to take the load off my primary gaming PC.
[2:16:35] <%dukenux> It's over.
[2:16:37] <spyder_casual> ok.
[2:16:38] <%starotter70> No it's a cat
[2:16:38] <WarchiefGoldva> That was easy as shit.
[2:16:38] <shotgang86> quest DONE
[2:16:39] <%dukenux> It's done.
[2:16:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> neohR neohUh
[2:16:46] <%FirearmsInstructor> neohRo neohH
[2:16:47] <Deadbulky> Spook
[2:16:48] <%Monkeyweed21> it was a bioghost
[2:16:49] <Jetsfantasy> neat
[2:16:59] <Mendin> bustin makes me feel good
[2:17:01] <%lulzysavant> What's it like to get a handy from a ghost?
[2:17:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ghosts are the real biocurses we make along the way
[2:17:02] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat It was @Roundelay11 . Good call man :)
[2:17:07] <%arcielardor> So when does the main character get a gun and telekinesis?
[2:17:15] <haisho> oh great now the library has bioghosts too
[2:17:15] <%king_wragles> @Big_King_Coconut ... I still think it's the music PJSalt
[2:17:20] <%Monkeyweed21> is this a good game for Woolie?
[2:17:26] <metrying> no
[2:17:28] <haisho> the world of Blasphemous is the worst
[2:17:31] <%dukenux> When does the Peninent get time stop tho
[2:17:32] <Rayorin> can the books be hit back?
[2:17:34] <%Big_King_Coconut> @king_wragles that's the easy, big brain way to finish the quest
[2:17:34] <%Pinkaminks> no, its the best game for woolie
[2:17:42] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> it would scare woolie
[2:17:43] <%king_wragles> @Big_King_Coconut LUL
[2:17:46] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger oh for sure. Even given all I just said, it also comes down to exactly what kind of content you're using it for as well.
[2:17:48] <%Crushter> big horror
[2:18:00] <%dukenux> Woolie, the guy that wants people to watch Serbian Film?
[2:18:08] <%dukenux> *serbski
[2:18:13] <metrying> never watch serbian film
[2:18:18] <metrying> dont do it
[2:18:19] <%dukenux> nah, that's too dark for him
[2:18:21] <Rayorin> ah question answered
[2:18:21] <%king_wragles> @dukenux good point, he might actually like this.... but probably not
[2:18:22] <%starotter70> Can't wait to show my club Serbian Film
[2:18:33] <%arcielardor> So is he just haunted now?
[2:18:34] <%Punchasaur> worst game for Woolie is Billy Hatcher and the giant egg
[2:18:38] <%Hydrapissed> DIO
[2:18:39] <%king_wragles> GOD DAD
[2:18:46] <poweruser> Can't wait to watch Serbian film with my mom.
[2:18:47] <%TheBitingIrish> Dio's dad? DansGame
[2:18:54] <%dukenux> This guy looks like Bloodborne
[2:18:55] <WarchiefGoldva> Dio's Dad!?
[2:18:56] <spyder_casual> is this a Jojo reference?
[2:18:57] <%Laecerelius> he has lots of keys
[2:18:58] <%dukenux> God's dad?
[2:19:01] <%LiquidShake83> ii made it!
[2:19:01] <%FirearmsInstructor> @starotter70 You trying to ruin lives?
[2:19:05] <%starotter70> Yes
[2:19:05] <%dukenux> KRONOS?
[2:19:09] <LodiFrostbeard> means god given
[2:19:14] <+Suplex9000> What is the significance of blood in this game?
[2:19:35] <WarchiefGoldva> I don't think there is a significance.
[2:19:37] <Rayorin> blood, it's what plants crave
[2:19:42] <ahmz1404> this game is so good, i hope it's a financial success so we can get another
[2:19:43] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat You have a favorite part of this game yet? (Character / mechanic / art / lore etc) If so what is it?
[2:19:55] <%baronblank> Is this super late game? I only just tuned in to pat playing it and I haven't seen much about the game myself
[2:19:56] <3xgilly> M U D D E R
[2:20:01] <%Punchasaur> blood is the juice of jesus
[2:20:06] <worldbrand> the setting is pretty dope
[2:20:07] <%Pinkaminks> its fairly late game yeah
[2:20:07] <%TheBitingIrish> @starotter70 Why must you make me google these things
[2:20:10] <IndoorSitup> Blood. It's what makes a Subaru a Subaru.
[2:20:12] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Mostly gaming. It's why I'm kinda done with From Soft. Everything else has no control issues, only their games. And I'm not about to upgrade hardware when I can get 50-60 fps from everything as I am lol.
[2:20:12] <%FirearmsInstructor> @3xgilly lol
[2:20:18] <%starotter70> @TheBitingIrish Blame Woolie
[2:20:18] <atravelbee> @Suplex9000 What is the significance of blood in the Bible?
[2:20:20] <spyder_casual> Whats that smell?
[2:20:26] <%Monkeyweed21> is the final boss just gonna be biojesus?
[2:20:30] <worldbrand> idk my bff jill
[2:20:34] <Mendin> The final boss is... something
[2:20:34] <%blastazoid26> @angriestpat Is the purple in you character a costume or an upgrade?
[2:20:35] <metrying> 🧀
[2:20:36] <WarchiefGoldva> I still don't understand the lorepiece about the guy that died and started BLEEDING like a fucker so much that people had to drag his corpse out of town and collect the overflow in buckets so he wouldn't cause a mass flooding with his bleeding.
[2:20:39] <Mendin> No spoilers for the final boss
[2:20:47] <%Pinkaminks> its a skin he got for owning the deluxe edition
[2:20:53] <%FirearmsInstructor> FUCK that's so brutal D:
[2:20:55] <%Punchasaur> uhh... khakis
[2:21:01] <%blastazoid26> neat

[2:21:48] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah I get ya. They've been making games for a while now, you'd think they'dve figured out how to stabilise their engine, but apparently they're too busy fetishising "difficulty" to work on that.
[2:21:49] <%moogleboy1984> @DexterousRob he's working towards the Rooftops and The Wall
[2:21:54] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Engwithan_Elder_God Also those are cardinals?

[2:23:40] <%Pinkaminks> Bloodstained managed to have that visual effect old cartoons had where you can tell what will be interactable, but its 3d
[2:23:43] <Mendin> The game is Ok (but is one to two patches from going up to Really Good) and the aesthetic is great
[2:23:46] <Ultimatefool> Elmo wouldn't have fallen into that pit 12 times just saying

[2:23:57] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger my first play though of Souls EVER was streaming the Prepare to Die edition on PS3. Oh man, Blighttown was NOT GREAT. I think it averaged about 17fps with drops as low as fucking 7.
[2:24:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight And despite all my shit-talking, I'm more sad than anything, because goddam if they don't do a good job with lore and world building and aesthetics.

[2:25:39] <deviljhojho94> I still cant get over how good this game looks

[2:26:35] <%king_wragles> @FirearmsInstructor cool you heard it too, so I'm not having a stroke, awesome.
[2:26:40] <ahmz1404> or safety from death
[2:26:51] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger the problem with their engines isn't the frame RATE mostly, it's the frame TIMING. Like, take 60fps. That SHOULD mean 1 frame every 16.66 seconds, right? If the timing is off, you might get like, 8 ms, then 32 ms, then 5 ms. The end result is it makes the framerate feel MUCH lower than it is, because you're getting visual hitching and stuttering that's right on the edge of perceptible.
[2:26:55] <%Pinkaminks> Oh, right, Pat said he met Cleofas already, has he talked to the window dude in town?
[2:27:00] <%FirearmsInstructor> @king_wragles I blinked a few times, but yea, he said what we heard.
[2:27:00] <%AbnormalVoid> SourPls

[2:27:06] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's pretty bad.
[2:27:07] <%dukenux> Is THAT the bleeding girl?
[2:27:09] <Ominnous> wait do you have an offering for her?
[2:27:09] <%Punchasaur> uh

[2:27:17] <%moogleboy1984> "Look how fucking rad it is! This bitch takes all the damage for us!"
[2:27:19] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat I think the incense / urns have collision when in the foreground and flashing?
[2:27:20] <%miguelrod777> that's one way to get down
[2:27:23] <MattDemers> This is my least favorite area due to all the swinging things.
[2:27:24] <3xgilly> Does anything happen if you kill her?
[2:27:25] <%Diabetic> I need clarification on what that was
[2:27:30] <WarchiefGoldva> That's a woman that's been cursed by the Miracle to basically be whipped, bleed and suffer forever.
[2:27:31] <+Roundelay11> he doesn't have the offerings for her because he hasn't gone to the rooftops yet
[2:27:31] <alexandrecau> might want to bring a wound kisser to her if you can
[2:27:32] <Ominnous> @AngriestPat did you have an offering for that lady?
[2:27:32] <%Pinkaminks> It will though, you can fuck up the quest if you dont have it before hand
[2:27:33] <%starotter70> Reminds me of a vn i was reading
[2:27:36] <%Crushter> @3xgilly you get the bad end of the quest

[2:27:49] <%floralkami> @AngriestPat remeber to duck

[2:28:01] <%Punchasaur> this is what the church does with your donations
[2:28:05] <3xgilly> @Crushter Oh damn
[2:28:06] <%FirearmsInstructor> @Engwithan_Elder_God Yea you're super right. They're cardinals. I looked a lot closer now. Thought they were old ladies or something.
[2:28:34] <+Roundelay11> she has three offerings you get from the next zone above this one
[2:28:37] <WarchiefGoldva> This world is fucked, man. These zealots scare the shit out of me.
[2:28:39] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger things like RDR2 and Horizon, on the other hand - their frame timing is stable as FUUUUCK, at least on the PS4 Pro. 30fps gets you a frame every 33.3ms with very few if ANY exceptions. The end result is incredibly smooth and actually looks better than a 60fps game that can't keep its timing stable.
[2:28:39] <%Diabetic> He's FUCKING UPSET now
[2:28:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight You're not wrong, I just refer to it as framerate since I believe they tie everything mechanical in that series to the framerate which is bonkers. Means if the fps shit the bed, gameplay goes out the window.
[2:28:45] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat Why not?
[2:28:46] <%starotter70> Is that a challenge?
[2:28:49] <%NeroInfinite> now he gonna go scream

[2:29:23] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Can you attack or do special abilities on a ladder? (Like the energy burst cylinder thing?)

[2:29:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Being a cat he would demand to be petted all day only to attack after 2 minutes.
[2:29:57] <spyder_casual> thanks
[2:29:57] <Mendin> @spyder_casual If you go for semi-completionism, 15ish hours +/- 3
[2:29:59] <%Pinkaminks> its been about, 2-3 hours? I got 100% at 15 hours

[2:30:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight And terrible optimization lol. It's why anytime someone said they wanted From to do a Berserk game, I was screaming inside. That franchise deserves better.

[2:36:56] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger but yeah I was fucking infuriated that Sekiro demanded frame-perfect timing from the player, whilst serving up the jankiest framerate crap I'd seen since PS3 dark souls.
[2:36:59] <WarchiefGoldva> I'm enjoying going to Twitter and looking up River City Girl combo videos quite a lot more than I thought I would.

[2:42:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> @firearmsinstructor it's at the Gaylord National Hotel in Oxon Hill, Maryland.
[2:42:52] <WarchiefGoldva> Socorro can literally mean "the act of asking for help" or "giving assistance to those that did", depending on context.
[2:42:56] <atravelbee> @King_Wolf_Rigger it can be easy to put down, shits so good, shits SO hard
[2:42:57] <+Order_of_Mystery> hey chat, does anyone know what mod Pat was referring to in one of his fallout 4 tweets awhile ago? the 'synth dad' one?
[2:43:00] <%Jaxnos> does this game have its own path of pain?
[2:43:07] <3xgilly> @Ascethetic There is a premere going on rn
[2:43:10] <haisho> did he find ANOTHER Path of Pain?
[2:43:13] <%arcielardor> That hat is still so rediculous
[2:43:23] <%Calek> @Order_of_Mystery another start or something like that
[2:43:29] <deviljhojho94> platforming takes a backseat here compared to hollow knight
[2:43:30] <+prism_zet> angry table
[2:43:30] <%Calek> the rest is just role play
[2:43:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Order_of_Mystery I read that more like his headcanon was his player character was a synth, to explain the stupidity.

[2:49:11] <atravelbee> @AngriestPat So was the miracle an AWE?
[2:49:11] <%senorpapel> @panicswytch cuz stabbing yourself is a powerup, just like irl.

[2:50:17] <%Punchasaur> that's a dick
[2:50:24] <%senorpapel> That’s why scarred peeps are so tough
[2:50:27] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I took a lot of bullets, now I can't be shot.

[2:51:26] <deviljhojho94> Pathetic tomatoDevious
[2:51:27] <pabloelenano2> @aishman my bad chatolisism
[2:51:29] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> watch out for spikes
[2:51:34] <%Dakuu75> FIRST TRY, let's GO~!
[2:51:35] <%floralkami> Wait, that last vial didn't give any health back @AngriestPat
[2:51:50] <Ominnous> now death
[2:51:51] <+PanicSwytch> Is the game difficult in relation to hollow knight?
[2:51:52] <ahmz1404> change the poison one to the hand
[2:51:56] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger kinda like how in the original Civ game, Ghandi was the most likely to go to nuclear war because of a buffer underrun
[2:51:59] <%Crushter> yes
[2:51:59] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[2:51:59] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> yes
[2:51:59] <+Roundelay11> yah
[2:52:00] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:52:02] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Those are great. I love it when a computer goes "-1 = infinity, right? Yeah."
[2:52:02] <%Soul_Intern> Teppers
[2:52:03] <%DedlokPM> yes
[2:52:03] <%aishman> Yeah it was the Butcher
[2:52:04] <atravelbee> Iframes on heal is like a literal blessing
[2:52:06] <PkSilent01> yes
[2:52:06] <haisho> it was more bone yes
[2:52:07] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> oooooooo
[2:52:08] <Buzzard42> maybe
[2:52:09] <%Monkeyweed21> you got a boner
[2:52:12] <Mendin> The platforming is a bit fiddlier than hollow knight
[2:52:13] <Paperware> yeah the butcher
[2:52:14] <%Crushter> big boner
[2:52:16] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger basically yeah.
[2:52:18] <%senorpapel> Is this 2d darknsouls?
[2:52:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Patitent one do not lose faith
[2:52:19] <%Punchasaur> I hope this gets modded to have a veggie tales skin
[2:52:34] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur Cursed
[2:52:37] <+RiceeFTW> this is 2d dark souls if dark souls happened during the Spanish Inquisition
[2:52:40] <%dukenux> I think the game is about the critique the part of catholic faith that put suffering on pedestal, as something nobilitating, and leading to holliness. the whole martyrdom idea.
[2:52:44] <ZE_Count> You can do it Conehead Jesus!
[2:52:47] <%arcielardor> So are you trying to recreate a skeleton, frankenstein-style?
[2:52:51] <%WhereIsWill> Spanish catholic apocalypse THE GAME
[2:52:55] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger well actually it's "-1 = 255" but a lot of games have "maximum attribute values" lower than 255, so it results in batshit behaviour when it happens.
[2:53:00] <%arcielardor> Like is this a paige game?
[2:53:02] <%Dakuu75> yeah, first try. I had faith
[2:53:04] <ahmz1404> pat the secret relic isn't equipped
[2:53:10] <%Agami23> good job pat
[2:53:10] <%dukenux> which, isn't uniform to catholicism, but that's the esthetic this game picked
[2:53:14] <%PatIsMyHero> How goes it?
[2:53:17] <%Punchasaur> @soul_intern you want this to be true
[2:53:20] <%Crushter> @dukenux you are correct, the Pope's wish for divine punishment for the sake of divinity is the driving force for fuck
[2:53:28] <%senorpapel> @riceeftw i think you just unveiled fromsofts next game
[2:53:32] <Parapattern> The player character is Martin Luther
[2:53:34] <%aishman> So...why do you wear a big hat? Is it so all can be jealous of your big hat?
[2:53:42] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur If my eyes were scorched, sure
[2:53:45] <%Maids4lyfe> it's a spanish catholic thing
[2:53:46] <%Crushter> @aishman it's a common helm for sinners or penitents
[2:53:48] <Mendin> the big hat is like a dunce cap for sinners
[2:53:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Functionally infinite. My favourite kind.
[2:53:54] <%hussdogrob> @angriestpat you gonna check out Links Awakening on stream at all?
[2:53:54] <%RubberFistFight> @aishman it's so big because it's so full of mercy.

[2:55:09] <%Soul_Intern> ARE YOU FEELING IT YET PAT?
[2:55:12] <Parapattern> It's like the hat of that one Undertale monster
[2:55:14] <fazoburquina> why would you ever remove the anti pitfall relic?
[2:55:28] <Mendin> Ice Hat?
[2:55:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Parapattern ice hat
[2:55:34] <%Soul_Intern> @Parapattern Ice cap, if he were a heretial catholic
[2:55:34] <deviljhojho94> @RubberFistFight I mean its probably true! But you know what they say about men with big hats. They have big feet

[2:55:52] <+nekodelic> The fuckk are you doing?
[2:55:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AngriestPat the bells call the elevator
[2:55:59] <Mendin> Ring the elevator bell my dude
[2:56:06] <%senorpapel> What are the odds that yachtclub snuck shovel knight into this game?
[2:56:08] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat hit the bell to summon the elevator
[2:56:09] <%Zutrax> If you fall in an abyss that has no new room under it, it just goes to the room that's under it on the map
[2:56:14] <deviljhojho94> Mother of mothers is the most catholic shit ever
[2:56:16] <+Snirtax> @AngriestPat You need to signal the elevator by hitting the bell, otherwise it won't come down
[2:56:18] <%RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 I have big hands and big feet. When I was 16 I unironically used the "big hands/feet" line in an attempt to flirt. It went about as well as you'd imagine.
[2:56:18] <%aishman> Man the music in this game is GREAT
[2:56:20] <Mendin> @senorpapel He's in a painting in the haunted gallery

[2:57:51] <Mendin> @Punchasaur Look up Ten Piedad
[2:57:52] <%aishman> Is he gonna be in anything considered an indie game?
[2:57:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I hope Baphomet is in this
[2:57:55] <Jetsfantasy> Is it me or does The Pennant One's crouch look almost like a dab. It bugged me so much during my playthough
[2:57:59] <%senorpapel> Shovel knight has become all game
[2:58:00] <%dukenux> Shovel Knight Everywher System

[3:00:37] <%RubberFistFight> @WarchiefGoldva yeah... I mean playable Hornet was a promised stretch goal for the first game, even though it got funded it never happened.
[3:00:52] <deviljhojho94> vampire bloodlines 2 also comes a bit before cyberpunk i think
[3:00:56] <%Soul_Intern> @WarchiefGoldva Ive been meaning to play HK again, so sad that Silksong is getting delayed like that
[3:00:57] <%Crushter> 3 zones instead of like 5, but ymmv
[3:01:02] <%Crushter> yes
[3:01:03] <+nekodelic> Yep
[3:01:03] <WarchiefGoldva> @RubberFistFight To be fair, they did transform that promise into Silksong.
[3:01:06] <fazoburquina> yep

[3:01:24] <%dukenux> the world map that is
[3:01:25] <%Dakuu75> did he ever do the "end her suffering" thing with the torture-lady?
[3:01:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight all backers are getting Skilksong free
[3:01:28] <Ominnous> pat look out

[3:01:39] <thattallguy47> 50%
[3:01:42] <%RubberFistFight> @WarchiefGoldva yes, but the thing is people paid for that, and now they're gonna have to pay again for the new game. The first game was awesome, no denying that, but still I can't lie and say that doesn't bother me.

[3:13:13] <%arcielardor> @lols_royce because jesus
[3:13:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @lols_royce he knocked icecream cone from a priests hand
[3:13:14] <Ventuss> he is a dunce

[3:13:30] <%Punchasaur> he would suck at limbo
[3:13:31] <%Crushter> @WarchiefGoldva no its God, YHWH. They speak about its divine will. The Father was the first to interpret its will
[3:13:33] <+RiceeFTW> his crime is having an ugly ice cream cone on his face like gucci
[3:13:34] <ZE_Count> please its Conehead Jesus Pat.
[3:13:35] <%dukenux> John Blasphemous has to wear this vone, cause he was a very bad boy.

[3:14:03] <%RubberFistFight> lol fucken John Blasphemous
[3:14:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> @RubberFistFight thus the reason he pays Petitence
[3:14:17] <%Soul_Intern> @RubberFistFight John Blaspheman
[3:14:18] <WarchiefGoldva> @Crushter Ah, I see. I figured that they referred to the Grievous Miracle itself as God.
[3:14:23] <ZE_Count> Do you all the tasty bones yet?
[3:14:26] <%NeroInfinite> Did pat get all of the seals for the lady?
[3:14:27] <Rayorin> some days I don't notice it as much, but sometimes it is the absolute worst
[3:14:28] <%Crushter> It's the way God works through
[3:14:29] <%RubberFistFight> @Soul_Intern attorney at law?
[3:14:37] <TomDanksEGOT> so was The Grievous Miracle a single act or is it just the Will of God so it can happen anytime and there are multiple occurrences? Im just a little confused since there is a witness of the Grievous Miracle
[3:14:37] <Mendin> "Guilt, Repentance, Mourning, and every pain of the soul of mankind were visibly and tangibly manifested everywhere and in all of us: Sometime in the form of blessing and grace, sometime in the form of punishment and corruption. Penance never ends, but changes, hurts, and condemns at will. That Divine Will, equally pious and cruel, which we could not and will NEVER be able to unravel, was called... The Miracle."

[3:14:55] <deviljhojho94> lionhead studios
[3:14:57] <%Soul_Intern> @RubberFistFight Just in case
[3:15:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> More dudes with big dick energy.
[3:15:13] <ZE_Count> I wish there was a Black&White 3
[3:15:22] <%Crushter> @TomDanksEGOT it has happened various times throughout history, this most recent use of it touched the whole Land instead
[3:15:23] <%RubberFistFight> Basically a divine force fulfilled everyone's prayers without any kind of interpretation or translation. Result: whooooole lot of misery and suffering.
[3:15:24] <TomDanksEGOT> @Mendin ooooh ok that makes it more clear thanks
[3:15:26] <Mendin> That's the game's intro monologue
[3:15:32] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat The skill you get as the last skill is the most powerful move in the game
[3:15:34] <a_mad_dragon> @AngriestPat advance warning, you can't teleport between killing those three enemies
[3:15:40] <%dukenux> The Miracle sounds kina like the Eclipse from Berserk
[3:15:53] <%Crushter> Only if you use it like an asshole
[3:15:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> ded

[3:16:03] <Personified134> basically imagine everyone in berserk worshipping the eclips
[3:16:06] <%Katashi25> I love they how the prisoners have the running frames of a super nintendo enemy on ice.
[3:16:09] <WarchiefGoldva> Look at that boy's peepee.
[3:16:13] <%RubberFistFight> And because this is steeped in Spanish Catholicism, everyone cried out "WE DESERVED THIS!" as they got variously mutilated and disfigured.
[3:16:28] <%Crushter> @RubberFistFight actually not a single soul asked for this deal
[3:16:33] <Mendin> And/or "HURT ME MORE DADDY"
[3:16:38] <%Crushter> Blame it on His Holiest of Holies
[3:16:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Crushter well one guy did

[3:32:13] <LodiFrostbeard> this was the toughest boss for me
[3:32:14] <Mendin> This guy is unironically a Lord of Cinder - he got burnt to death and returned
[3:32:17] <%Invlux> if your boner is burning, you should really see a doctor
[3:32:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This cumbo also have stumbo hat.
[3:32:18] <+FoolsArcade> Quirce looks like the Slave Knight
[3:32:19] <+Xenoska> Are there no health pots? holy canolli!
[3:32:23] <%RubberFistFight> @simulationbard I periodically rewatch that on account of it being fucking hilarious.

[3:33:24] <KishinGrek> Use those invincibility frames
[3:33:25] <haitakaa> am I crazy or is that bosses name have improper capitalization
[3:33:27] <%moogleboy1984> @AzureHawk_Streams he's downloading right now
[3:33:30] <%Soul_Intern> OH MAN THATS SO COOL
[3:33:31] <+VantomPayne> might be late but the healing sound effect sounds like pop open a soda
[3:33:39] <Jetsfantasy> Those numbers will change based on what stage the fight is in
[3:33:41] <%Crushter> @haitakaa if its part of the name you capitalize everything
[3:33:42] <%Soul_Intern> @VantomPayne Why
[3:33:42] <cureneckbeard> rub your balls on his sword so he wont' want to pick it back up
[3:33:54] <%WhereIsWill> go the distance!!
[3:34:00] <GiygasDrillBreak> you can REACH him on the ceiling
[3:34:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> but his balls will catch fire
[3:34:02] <+Xenoska> What difficulty is he playing on?

[3:34:24] <%Soul_Intern> MORTIS TIME
[3:34:24] <%Ion_Laser> sbeefDead
[3:34:25] <+SamleyTimes> F
[3:34:26] <deviljhojho94> Close
[3:34:26] <ZE_Count> thats a boss
[3:34:31] <+Caffieantedjedi> mjbF
[3:34:32] <KishinGrek> But the fires hot enough to burn the ball germs away
[3:34:32] <simulationbard> That was pretty good
[3:34:33] <%moogleboy1984> So, Quirce's lore is pretty metal
[3:34:33] <Mendin> Yeah that boy is a bit spicy
[3:34:34] <+Xenoska> @Jetsfantasy for real?
[3:34:35] <%Thelastofthemohicans> F
[3:34:35] <AzureHawk_Streams> F
[3:34:35] <%Soul_Intern> COOL ASS BOSS I TELL YOU WHAT
[3:34:35] <%NeroInfinite> p. close
[3:34:37] <%senorpapel> **mortis**
[3:34:40] <%cylish> isnt that just the dude from DS3?
[3:34:41] <%Punchasaur> Stoopid cumbo
[3:34:44] <ahmz1404> using that fire defense?
[3:34:45] <+RiceeFTW> everything about this game is pretty metal
[3:34:48] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat if you go right up thereyou can get a faster shortcut
[3:34:54] <%zamzoph> get rekt LUL
[3:34:54] <%moogleboy1984> he was wrongly convicted and sentenced to die by burning at the Stake and the fire said "nah, he legit"
[3:34:56] <Jetsfantasy> @Xenoska Yeah, I don't remember this game even having a difficulty select
[3:34:56] <cosmicgoatee> Good first try considering
[3:34:58] <%Soul_Intern> @cylish Yeah it totally Slave Knight Gael
[3:35:01] <implied_consent> Why don't you just use your giant power geyser?
[3:35:03] <T_Sasquatch> that boss charge is so slow , how are you getting hit LUL
[3:35:11] <KishinGrek> Chickens?
[3:35:13] <%Thelastofthemohicans> At least they have the same cool heretic hat!
[3:35:13] <%Soul_Intern> @T_Sasquatch Cumbo
[3:35:16] <puse9> because its slow
[3:35:22] <Jetsfantasy> You lost too much HP while learning his patterns
[3:35:25] <%moogleboy1984> @T_Sasquatch have you ever played Guitar Hero on the lowest difficulty?
[3:35:26] <KishinGrek> Were those chickens?
[3:35:27] <cureneckbeard> emlo
[3:35:27] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat the laser beam is good for him post the dash with his own power geyser
[3:35:30] <suikudo> you need to use that sonic boom more often
[3:35:32] <WarchiefGoldva> The Miracle actually respawned him as he kept burning to death over and over again.
[3:35:36] <Mendin> So Quirce adn those mad lads are showing off another mechanical quirk that detracts from this game - Your knockdown and get up animation speed is kinda just slow enough to get you hitlocked a bit
[3:35:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Learning patterns is for cowards who can't attack.
[3:35:45] <%starotter70> Yeeeeee, just snitched on the guys in my dorm for being super loud at night
[3:35:48] <%RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 oh man i totally understand what you mean there lol LUL
[3:36:01] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> I don't know how I feel about bonfires not refilling mana when they refill your health and you can directly turn health into mana
[3:36:05] <3xgilly> wait does the sonic boom cost life?
[3:36:08] <deviljhojho94> Snitches dont get stitches
[3:36:08] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @starotter70 Big mood. Nicely done.
[3:36:10] <Jetsfantasy> @Mendin Final boss can abuse that super well too... ESPECIALLY if it corners you
[3:36:14] <%senorpapel> @starotter70 shoulda went and be loud with em
[3:36:18] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> it's not that they really don't fill your mana, it just puts a middleman in of like 30 seconds of cutting yourself
[3:36:18] <puse9> magic is op in this game
[3:36:19] <+RiceeFTW> @Hunk_Of_Dunk they're blood bullets
[3:36:20] <%RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 snitches get cumbod
[3:36:26] <+Xenoska> @Jetsfantasy Noice. Shall i await a review video of a game journo failing horribly cuphead style? lol
[3:36:28] <implied_consent> Pat will you admit you totally wanted to cry at the end of Outer Wilds?
[3:36:32] <+RiceeFTW> and most of the magic spells are really strong
[3:36:34] <%Crushter> @puse9 only if you spec into it, which is cool
[3:36:37] <+RiceeFTW> like, REALLY strong
[3:36:42] <T_Sasquatch> @moogleboy1984 i get that but man that charge is slowwww like you do it at the last second
[3:36:44] <%Soul_Intern> D:
[3:36:48] <deviljhojho94> @RubberFistFight i cant believe how dire that sounds
[3:36:52] <%Soul_Intern> D: D:
[3:36:53] <+SamleyTimes> he said bitch
[3:36:54] <suikudo> @implied_consent But he totally cried at the end of shadowbringers
[3:36:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Cumbod in the stumbo
[3:36:56] <%Crushter> I like that magic is swole if you put work into it

[3:39:28] <+SamleyTimes> he wasnt fiery tho
[3:39:29] <%jobbedbone> @Hunk_Of_Dunk I think inconvenience can be useful to drive a gameplay loop, without having to remove or cheapen systems

[3:46:32] <ZE_Count> The key must be silver, but not any kind. I want it to be the purest there is. Bring it to me when its beauty is as high as its task is meaningful. The chariot will be sealed and forbidden, and your horses will sleep for as long as I order it. This I command, and my command is the command of His Holiness Himself.

[4:14:17] <%RubberFistFight> @Rayorin it started as "stumbo", and then pat/paige were talking about cum and someone said "cumbo", and now here we are.

[4:14:49] <%RubberFistFight> @Rayorin and of course Pat screamed "NO NO DON'T MAKE THAT A THING" which only emboldened chat.
[4:14:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Truly, the origins of cumbo are blessed as the rains down in Africa.
[4:14:51] <%floralkami> Pat, you just nad it

[4:23:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Ancient Catholics ripped off Dark Souls
[4:23:48] <chronoxgp> aceticism
[4:23:49] <%Crushter> It's not Literally Christianity, it just uses its aesthetics
[4:23:49] <Ultimatefool> Did I miss all the sick ass boss fights
[4:23:49] <puse9> also pain
[4:23:50] <%arcielardor> The teachings of Cathol
[4:23:51] <MKUltima> Caltholicism took it from Dark Souls
[4:23:54] <%Noxyba> This is basically Warhammer Catholicism
[4:23:56] <+itsOnyxLeo> this reminds me a LOT of Hollow Knight, and that feels really really weird considering Hollow Knight is just Symphony of Zero Mission
[4:24:05] <%Crushter> @Ultimatefool you didn't miss the sickest one so don't worry
[4:24:06] <%moogleboy1984> Metsoulsvania
[4:24:09] <Ominnous> Catholicism is the Dark Souls of Religions

[4:24:21] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Catholic Berserk?
[4:24:22] <%Punchasaur> Mont saint Michel?
[4:24:23] <JDebss> Warhammer is basically Catholicism
[4:24:26] <Valdorick> Virgin Frankish Castles when Castile is just down south.
[4:24:26] <Coystick> The Anor Londo Everywhere System
[4:24:32] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And Code Vein takes place in France?
[4:24:32] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Ok, but is this actually paying homage to the lore of Christianity, or is it Evangalion lip service?

[4:25:16] <%Calek> jump after him
[4:25:16] <%TheBitingIrish> Down
[4:25:16] <%RubberFistFight> @CrystalLightPeachTea a LOT of it is heavily steeped in Spanish Catholic iconography and certain interpretations of things like sin, penance, holy intervention, etc.

[4:25:53] <%Crushter> @CrystalLightPeachTea It's Homage, it uses the imagery and setting to criticise a lot of the worship of pain, and the brutality of the church
[4:25:55] <Mendin> If you DONT give him the amulet, he'll jump
[4:26:06] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @Morbidmort @RubberFistFight @Crushter Thanks lads. Putting this on the wishlist.
[4:26:06] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat You're safe from fall damage because Catholics don't believe in gravity

[4:26:46] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat unfortunately it's in service to a big fucken lie.
[4:26:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> we fucked up
[4:26:48] <%Thelastofthemohicans> Thats a apatBig boy
[4:26:50] <%moogleboy1984> Jesus came back from space just to laugh at you
[4:26:52] <deviljhojho94> thats catholic guilt for ya! I think....
[4:26:53] <worldbrand> they basically just told copernicus to fuck off because he was annoying, not because they thought he was wrong
[4:26:56] <+ZenVulgarity> Sometimes you have to take the L
[4:26:56] <shevan123> space is cool as shit dude
[4:26:58] <DraxTD> do Catholics have a saint of falling deaths @AngriestPat ?
[4:27:00] <%Jolnir> apatLiz apatDab apatSmug apatWhat
[4:27:00] <Sparty9112> i think you mean Copernicus @AngriestPat
[4:27:00] <%KoyaMusa> historically the catholic church was very supportive of scientists, since they didn't see it as conflicting with faith
[4:27:00] <ZE_Count> That was a big stumbo on their part!
[4:27:01] <+Deathtronhammer> No foolin' space is coolin'
[4:27:02] <%Crushter> FOR TWISTED ARE, HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE THE PATHS OF THE MIRACLE
[4:27:04] <%Shadicara> Church science to find that jesus magic
[4:27:05] <puse9> down thrust
[4:27:09] <%Noxyba> The Catholic Church is usually pretty good about science yeah
[4:27:14] <Blank9> you don't know, maybe galileo was a real dick about it
[4:27:19] <deviljhojho94> gotta catch em all
[4:27:19] <%Punchasaur> see you, space cumbo
[4:27:20] <+SamleyTimes> monkaS
[4:27:20] <%CrezaK> We got a saint for everything
[4:27:21] <Morbidmort> There's a saint for everything
[4:27:22] <%Jeemukun> Galileo was always being a big douche about it tho
[4:27:23] <%zamzoph> don't tell Paige that space is cool
[4:27:24] <xeros720> there was a saint arms race for a bit
[4:27:25] <%Jolnir> apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada apatCanada
[4:27:25] <%hntronium> Galileo was a massive asshole about it
[4:27:25] <ZE_Count> I like finding the really weird ones.
[4:27:28] <DraxTD> Saint Fall Damage!
[4:27:28] <puse9> there's even a baker saint
[4:27:29] <Coystick> Saint ofthe stumbo'd cumbo
[4:27:29] <+oOZtkOo> they told galileo to fuck off because he wouldnt stop insulting the pope
[4:27:30] <%Monkeyweed21> pat will become the saint of Cumbo
[4:27:32] <SlimeSlimeSlime> How... Do you get to be THAT saint?
[4:27:32] <Firesparks> saint are basically catholic deity
[4:27:33] <%Mr_Pylon> More saints than playable pokemon now
[4:27:35] <%Noxyba> Galileo was more complicated, yeah.
[4:27:36] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And some of them are saints of multiple things.
[4:27:36] <DeliciousPears> There are a shit ton of saints because that was the only way they could convert pagans
[4:27:37] <ahmz1404> I feel like the loading time for the warp needs to be artificially lengthened
[4:27:37] <marvel877> "Slip the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of God."
[4:27:37] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> One thing I've noticed with this game is that it feels like it lacks very good mobility or teleports around the map
[4:27:37] <deviljhojho94> Galileo was pat
[4:27:37] <Personified134> the catholics have absolutely no problem making up bullshit for people to be the saint of, just to let people be saints
[4:27:38] <+SamleyTimes> anyone remember the original 151? tomatoCool
[4:27:39] <xeros720> saints were realliy profitable for towns, so there may have been some made up ones
[4:27:41] <%SirGO0SE> LOL 400?! thats the LOW END bro
[4:27:42] <deviljhojho94> PogChamp
[4:27:42] <JDebss> they were handing out sainthood in the streets back then
[4:27:43] <CrystalLightPeachTea> "There are more than 10,000 saints recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, though the names and histories of some of these holy men and women have been lost to history. "
[4:27:43] <Firesparks> instead of pantheon, they have saints
[4:27:44] <%Shadicara> Pat has always been saint cumbo
[4:27:50] <alexandrecau> being a big douche about being right is still better than prosecutiong someone politewly
[4:27:51] <deviljhojho94> i only pray to gen 1 saints
[4:27:51] <cosmicgoatee> Galileo is Ebriatas LUL
[4:27:51] <+Zereaux> what would pat be the saint of?
[4:27:52] <mechengineers> yeah i thought it was galeo pissing off the wrong guy like in the mob
[4:27:55] <%zamzoph> is John Paul 2 a saint?
[4:27:55] <%42nfl19> @AngriestPat Saints also get updated, like the saint of information also became the saint of the internet or something.
[4:27:59] <+ZenVulgarity> wtf
[4:28:01] <%Noxyba> The whole controversy about Galileo is more just protestants being salty
[4:28:03] <karl_rex> Saint of Cumbo
[4:28:08] <puse9> that spell is op
[4:28:16] <+ZenVulgarity> Is this just some NG+ shit?
[4:28:16] <%Punchasaur> Saint Logan Paul
[4:28:18] <+SamleyTimes> latest saint is mother theresa
[4:28:20] <marvel877> A lot of saints pull double duty and rep more than one subject.
[4:28:21] <Morbidmort> @Firesparks that's actually the primary doctrinal issue between Christianity and Islam
[4:28:23] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat Now you are Blessed by Tentudia and Sorocco
[4:28:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Galileo did nothing wrong.
[4:28:28] <Ominnous> wait these enemies are evil?
[4:28:29] <%floralkami> Wouldn't you be a massive asshole if the people around yiu were literal yuppies telling you "NO BUT OUR PLANET IS IMPORTANT THO"
[4:28:30] <DraxTD> <.< aparently there are MORE than 10,000 saints in the Catholic Church
[4:28:34] <%Shadicara> Summon the nuns
[4:28:36] <deviljhojho94> tomatoPain
[4:28:40] <%Soul_Intern> Mega invincibility frames
[4:28:45] <Mendin> Saint Erasmus of Formiae is the Patron Saint Of People Who Work At Great Heights
[4:28:47] <%ScreamLord> @AngriestPat And a lot of them are Saints of multiple things. Like Saint Nicolas was the Patron Saint of Gifts, Children, and Prostitutes
[4:28:49] <ZE_Count> Summon your Nun stand Pat!
[4:28:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @floralkami I would. In fact, I am an asshole about that lol.
[4:28:55] <Mendin> So that's probably who we're praying to for the no falling
[4:28:57] <%floralkami> wow, that sounded way off from what it meant
[4:28:59] <%Monkeyweed21> clemps is in this game?
[4:29:00] <JDebss> I'm the patron saint of pulling out
[4:29:02] <puse9> its basically invulnirability to ALL damage for a short while @AngriestPat
[4:29:03] <ahmz1404> look at those stat bars and health flasks
[4:29:05] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami yeah exactly, he was an asshole about it because he was sick of being told he was wrong without even a cursory glance at his findings.
[4:29:11] <%Soul_Intern> @floralkami YEAH LUL
[4:29:13] <%Calek> @ScreamLord that would explain all the Ho Ho Ho's

[4:29:35] <marvel877> yeah, but do you still suffer knockback???
[4:29:37] <%KoyaMusa> is it all of your fervor?
[4:29:41] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami all the church cared about was enforcing their model of geocentrism, and preventing contradiction of it.
[4:29:44] <%SirGO0SE> i-frames-4-days
[4:29:44] <Notterr> @marvel877 no
[4:29:44] <+IMCthulhu> its faaaantastic
[4:29:44] <Blank9> I wish more games used super heavy religious imagery and just embraced it
[4:29:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Become the King Coward Cumbo you were meant to be.
[4:29:48] <alexandrecau> I mean vatican still canonized people so saints are gonna keep piling up

[4:37:50] <+SamleyTimes> nicenicenice
[4:37:50] <%Crushter> @Morbidmort nope
[4:37:51] <%kiiiirsten> Is this game really gonna shit the bed the last 10 minutes?
[4:37:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> the confliction is confused? why?
[4:37:53] <Coystick> noice
[4:37:54] <%aishman> Oh that would do it
[4:38:01] <%hntronium> nice girl
[4:38:02] <Morbidmort> @Crushter Well fuck
[4:38:03] <%miguelrod777> jarney
[4:38:07] <Mendin> @Morbidmort None of the thing with the thing, we're doing that after this
[4:38:08] <%Calek> I didn't know this existed, that would have been really useful
[4:38:10] <%hntronium> amen
[4:38:11] <%Crushter> @Morbidmort it's better to do B first anyway
[4:38:11] <%TheBitingIrish> Force?
[4:38:13] <+Frankyzappa> fhis game is so goddamn cool
[4:38:13] <%KoyaMusa> time to destroy the statues yeah?
[4:38:15] <%aishman> @Crushter Cause in the last hour I've seen so many maps, like the map stuff. The game looks awesome and I hope they fix it all cause DANG
[4:38:19] <%RubberFistFight> @aishman because it's an indie title from a very small studio. Honestly it's getting stupid how many times people have had to say that at this point. It's not a AAA title. The dev team know. They're working on it. They don't have EA bucks or Epic bucks to throw at it, so it takes time. It's only been a week and a half since release.
[4:38:25] <%Shadicara> Time to kill jesus
[4:38:26] <%Crushter> @aishman most of the bugs are really minor
[4:38:27] <%Prism_Wing> This art reminds me of I Have No Mouth
[4:38:35] <+SamleyTimes> hes gonna do the bad ending before destroying statues
[4:38:41] <%moogleboy1984> spoilers: if you use her on the first three bosses, she dies and you can just re-enter the last boss room you used her in to get the spell
[4:38:44] <Brother_Coduss> time to do it like brutus
[4:38:45] <%Soul_Intern> FINAL BOSS TIME
[4:38:46] <NameNumber> @Prism_Wing A little bit, yeah.
[4:38:52] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> No EA bucks, but fewer bugs than most EA games.
[4:38:55] <Valdorick> Blasphemous final?
[4:39:01] <Mendin> Final Boss Time

[4:39:49] <ZE_Count> WHAT IS THE NATURE OF A CUMBO!
[4:39:50] <%aishman> @RubberFistFight I understand, I do but stuff like the map not filling out the whole way, the thing with the guilt spawning in the spikes? I dunno I guess I've been spoiled with indie titles without bugs like that. It is a really good game from what I see though and I'm glad it's being succesfull.

[4:44:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> These bosses are easy? Somebody's a hot-shot.
[4:44:49] <%floralkami> @lodifrostbeard oof, what kind of standards you holding?
[4:44:52] <Personified134> oh did I just miss the final boss
[4:44:55] <xeros720> good catch, same tells
[4:44:55] <deviljhojho94> he seems fucking rad
[4:44:55] <Personified134> my internet dropped
[4:44:57] <LaughingCatt> mope
[4:45:01] <worldbrand> nah show's just starting
[4:45:01] <LaughingCatt> *nope
[4:45:01] <%moogleboy1984> I don't remember if he does Fire attacks on the normal ending
[4:45:02] <%Shadicara> Nothing can prepare you for Catholic Galactus
[4:45:04] <marvel877> Nah
[4:45:06] <+IMCthulhu> mopey pope
[4:45:07] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami yeah i'm wondering that too
[4:45:10] <Mendin> Behold, Personafied
[4:45:13] <@commanderclaw> Catholactus
[4:45:15] <%Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard I mean I thought the bosses were easy too once I 100 percented the game, but I think Dark Souls bosses are easy after the fact too
[4:45:17] <Personified134> but I missed pat seeing the final boss
[4:45:21] <Personified134> which seems like just as bad
[4:45:25] <+CaptainGrime> @Personified134 GIGA POPE
[4:45:32] <Personified134> I can see that
[4:45:34] <karl_rex> The time has come and so has Catholicism
[4:45:35] <%senorpapel> @personified134 internet drop? Purge the redbar!
[4:45:35] <%Soul_Intern> HIT STUN
[4:45:37] <worldbrand> that is a lightning juggle
[4:45:37] <JDebss> My DnD character will need a phylactery too one day
[4:45:37] <marvel877> SCOOPS
[4:45:39] <Valdorick> Unlimited lightning combo works
[4:45:40] <Coystick> If/when you get within the final segment of his health I'm bailing
[4:45:45] <Personified134> I HAVE A WIRED CONNECTION
[4:45:46] <%Jolnir> uh oh stinky
[4:45:47] <ShadeTheNovice> That lightning is no joke
[4:45:55] <marvel877> You can stay in the air an awful long time
[4:45:56] <katocrimson> wow the lightning stunlock sucks
[4:46:00] <deviljhojho94> Do air combos
[4:46:03] <Mendin> Elemental Damage as a whole in this game seems slightly overtuned
[4:46:04] <NameNumber> A little Sigma-esque.
[4:46:13] <%SilvaChariot0133> oof man that damage
[4:46:13] <xeros720> hehe, he just gets faster
[4:46:17] <Valdorick> Radiance this boss is not.
[4:46:19] <%Jolnir> apatWhat
[4:46:24] <%RubberFistFight> @Crushter personally I think it's telling that he hasn't responded to multiple attempts to get him to elaborate on his "too easy and repetitive" claims. Sort of like he doesn't actually have anything to back that up.
[4:46:24] <%moogleboy1984> rekt
[4:46:28] <+Jaysky> That's a lotta damage
[4:46:29] <+Vostroyan1> holy

[4:46:41] <+Blackmage9999> The nun prayer?
[4:46:42] <%Crushter> fire damage is his strongest i recommend quirce's bead @AngriestPat
[4:46:42] <+SamleyTimes> fire hurts bruh
[4:46:42] <+Binary_Fireball> TRIVIAL
[4:46:42] <candidateplays> The firestorm is really fucking power
[4:46:43] <Astaroth130> thats a spicy meatball
[4:46:43] <%floralkami> we over here looking at the pope almighty wrapped in mythral and gold, and this guy over here saying this the weakest part of the game?
[4:46:44] <ahmz1404> fire make bur
[4:46:45] <%Punchasaur> if only you had access to the 3rd dimension you could break the phylactery
[4:46:47] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat all the resistances for magic and elemental
[4:46:57] <%SoySocks> pat must become shmup god to dodge fire
[4:46:59] <katocrimson> bloodborne magic projectile bullshit
[4:47:09] <%Soul_Intern> BECOME MORE CUMBO PAT
[4:47:09] <%Shadicara> Man if that's god I might convert LUL
[4:47:13] <Personified134> chat how long is it gonna take him to beat this, I wanna go back in the vod and see him see his first time on the boss but I don't want to miss him winning
[4:47:14] <%Soul_Intern> AIR
[4:47:14] <%moogleboy1984> heart
[4:47:16] <+Ell1ot> wind water heart
[4:47:18] <%HyraFukit> Just dont get hit.
[4:47:19] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat dont forget the extra air attack
[4:47:19] <FranticFicus> CAPTAIN PLANET
[4:47:19] <MKUltima> CAPTAIN PLANET
[4:47:20] <theredhairedtrainer> gotta pump up that DPS
[4:47:21] <%Soul_Intern> EARTH
[4:47:23] <%Soul_Intern> WATER
[4:47:23] <Ventuss> captain planet
[4:47:23] <CrystalLightPeachTea> That's a good point, why can't he just attack the phylactery? It seems to be on the same layer as his monster mash face.
[4:47:25] <%Shadicara> HEART
[4:47:25] <%senorpapel> Imma go make my lunch, don’t beat the final boss just yet. @angriestpat
[4:47:26] <%SirGO0SE> WIND, WATER, HEART
[4:47:27] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami "The boss doesn't immediately murder me with a full-screen unblockable attack, this is TOO EASY!!" Fucken bullshit LUL
[4:47:28] <deviljhojho94> By your powers combined
[4:47:30] <TearDropBro> AIR
[4:47:31] <deviljhojho94> I am scrublord
[4:47:39] <+SamleyTimes> WHO COULD CONTROL ALL FOUR ELEMENTS
[4:47:39] <%Shadicara> I AM CUMBO
[4:47:43] <%The_Cassowary> Subway500 bonus50 Hey Pat, just wanted to thank you for all the amazing streams and podcasts, you always manage to crack me up even on the rough days so seriously thank you
[4:47:45] <laguerrilha> All changed when the Catholic church attacked
[4:47:48] <FranticFicus> I like how we all made a captain planet reference
[4:47:48] <%Soul_Intern> I AM CAPTAIN CUMBO
[4:47:51] <%moogleboy1984> toxic is trivial to dodge
[4:47:52] <Valdorick> Captain Jesus, he's your hero, gonna take the pantheon to zero.
[4:47:53] <JDebss> @CrystalLightPeachTea I was thinking that too
[4:47:55] <+Jaysky> Personified134 he only fought him the first time like 7 minutes ago so you could catch up
[4:47:55] <NameNumber> Gonna take pollution down to zero.
[4:47:56] <%Punchasaur> everything changed when the fire nation attacked
[4:47:57] <Tucker0603> BY YOUR POWERS COMBINED, you, ARE CATHOLIC MAN!!! @angriestpat
[4:48:01] <ahmz1404> is toxic really a threat though
[4:48:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Personified134 Don't worry about it. his first time wasn't anything special. Just stick around.
[4:48:05] <%Shadicara> Lost my shit at captain cumbo
[4:48:08] <%Crushter> @AngriestPat toxic isn't hard to dodge
[4:48:08] <cosmicgoatee> Captain Cumbo, he is a Humbo
[4:48:09] <Mendin> Best to be thorough
[4:48:09] <+CaptainGrime> @Tucker0603 LUL
[4:48:10] <%Soul_Intern> Toxic is not a threa tPat
[4:48:10] <%moogleboy1984> there's a Bead that does all elements
[4:48:15] <%TheBitingIrish> Can he not switch them during combat?
[4:48:17] <Personified134> its cool guys I have two monitors
[4:48:20] <Personified134> i'll peep it
[4:48:21] <Mendin> He doesnt have the spiral shell
[4:48:21] <%luftraumm1> there are some extra beads
[4:48:24] <%moogleboy1984> Seashell of the Inverted Spiral
[4:48:27] <+CaptainGrime> but theres nothing toxic in the fight
[4:48:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Personified134 ooh, fancy
[4:48:34] <%SirGO0SE> gonna take the Blumbo down to Zumbo, CAPTAIN CUMBO
[4:48:35] <%Crushter> @CaptainGrime the green attacks
[4:48:36] <%Kiiper> why not red wax?
[4:48:37] <%Punchasaur> water, earth, fire, cumbo
[4:48:37] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight and this is after the literal lord of cinder fight with female Virgil RIGHT after
[4:48:41] <Valdorick> Aw... damn it... I shoulda said gonna take the pagans down to 0.
[4:48:42] <+Jaysky> Except for Pat CaptainGrime
[4:48:45] <%Soul_Intern> @CaptainGrime There re some flying balls
[4:48:48] <%moogleboy1984> get rid of Wicker Knot for Red Bead
[4:49:00] <%arcielardor> Pat keeps getting balls in his face
[4:49:04] <+CaptainGrime> @Soul_Intern @Crushter oh i missed those
[4:49:07] <%moogleboy1984> I'm always right
[4:49:08] <+CaptainGrime> @Jaysky LUL
[4:49:09] <%Shadicara> Captain Cumbo vs Cathlactus
[4:49:11] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami I'm pretty sure he just doesn't like the game and is trying to find reasons to shit on it, because calling the bosses "too easy and repetitive" is just fucking absurd.
[4:49:16] <NameNumber> You got him this time.
[4:49:19] <TearDropBro> Fire bad, hoes mad
[4:49:27] <deviljhojho94> it ends tonight
[4:49:38] <%WhereIsWill> you went HAM last night tho pat
[4:49:38] <Valdorick> #Sponsered
[4:49:39] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight haven't even seen him in chat since then either.
[4:49:41] <deviljhojho94> Its pretty phenomenal yeah
[4:49:43] <Mendin> Behind the chalice bullshit, yeah
[4:49:44] <puse9> yup
[4:49:48] <+Jaysky> You can even get the other ending in the same playthrough which is nice
[4:49:49] <+SamleyTimes> YEAH THE CHALICE
[4:49:50] <Coystick> Chalice Pi\uzz
[4:49:51] <%luftraumm1> chalice
[4:49:52] <%floralkami> is that guy even in here?
[4:49:53] <%moogleboy1984> babies gives you a sick ass Familiar

[4:49:56] <+SamleyTimes> Oops all caps
[4:50:01] <MKUltima> I can't believe the pope is a coke kingpin
[4:50:01] <chronoxgp> this guy fights like dracula haha
[4:50:02] <Blank9> in a few hours dmc2 comes out for switch who's hyped
[4:50:03] <marvel877> Have you considered just accepting the lord into your heart, Pat?
[4:50:03] <xeros720> there's really not much filler in this game, it's all pretty cool
[4:50:03] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger oh don't think i hadn't noticed that, lol.
[4:50:09] <puse9> it took me a whole circuit of the map to get all 3
[4:50:11] <Mendin> Look at that dracula-ass cape teleport
[4:50:15] <worldbrand> Can you do like HK and kill all the enemies from one end of the path to the other?
[4:50:19] <marvel877> SCOOPS
[4:50:19] <+Ell1ot> what is this game? is this a Catholic souls?
[4:50:24] <%Crushter> my no flask run on this boss and Fem Vergil was fun
[4:50:27] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat you have literally to do the true ending gather the babies and do the chalice for the last sword upgrade
[4:50:28] <Mendin> Spanish Catholic Bloodborne M etroidvania
[4:50:29] <JDebss> @RubberFistFight This game looks sick but that "Vergil" fight was lame
[4:50:29] <+CaptainGrime> @Ell1ot yea
[4:50:30] <Valdorick> Glad to know his lnightning bullshit is bullshit even in phase 1
[4:50:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Ell1ot Yes
[4:50:37] <deviljhojho94> If i could make a single gameplay change it would be some invincibility to prevent stunlocking
[4:50:40] <marvel877> DANDRUFF
[4:50:41] <+Jaysky> Game is called Blasphemous Ell1ot
[4:50:41] <ahmz1404> you know its fake coz the screen doesnt go red
[4:50:41] <+Caffieantedjedi> Man, this first phase is cool because it looks like it is a way to introduce the attacks in the second phase, except he goes down so fast you don't see them all.
[4:50:43] <%RubberFistFight> @King_Wolf_Rigger I imagine he's crying hot, bitter tears into his frootloops grinding his teeth and muttering "WHY DO THEY LIKE THE THING I HATE, WHY"
[4:50:48] <%Soul_Intern> THE FINAL SHOWDOWN, CAPTAIN CUMBO VS NEGA POPE SUPREME
[4:50:49] <%Shadicara> Here comes Cathlactus
[4:50:50] <xeros720> the lightning stunlocking is pretty bs
[4:50:50] <%floralkami> @jdebss elaborate
[4:50:57] <+conradical> the fact that the lightning can actually combo you while you're getting up is really lame
[4:50:57] <%HyraFukit> Give pat your power!
[4:50:59] <waifoong98> @marvel877 ewww
[4:51:03] <Ominnous> They are russian doll phylacteries
[4:51:08] <nepwar> hey so is this just 2d dark souls or is it its own thing?
[4:51:10] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight lol nah. Prob just some hot-shot who wants to stir up shit.
[4:51:12] <Ominnous> each pope has a smaller pope around his neck
[4:51:15] <Coystick> Okay Air Impulse is key here
[4:51:18] <%Shadicara> Pray to cumbo that pat does not stumbo
[4:51:20] <%Crushter> @nepwar own thing
[4:51:24] <+Jaysky> I'd stay away from the fire completely till it's gone
[4:51:29] <%moogleboy1984> Lightning and Fire are the fuckers
[4:51:34] <%The_Cassowary> this looks tough as hell
[4:51:35] <JDebss> @floralkami Comparing a character doing the same move over and over to Vergil?
[4:51:39] <Coystick> I take back ragging on Air Impulse
[4:51:53] <asurite_warrior> So the pope is some sort of lich in this game?
[4:52:01] <Valdorick> Face fuck the enemy's enemies
[4:52:05] <nepwar> @Crushter cool cool cool
[4:52:05] <+Jaysky> Christ
[4:52:07] <Valdorick> .. attacks*
[4:52:07] <%Shadicara> No it's Catholic galactus
[4:52:07] <etoir> that's a lot of damage
[4:52:08] <NameNumber> Da Pope-a, lost-a his-a wallet.
[4:52:09] <+CaptainGrime> HYPER VIPER POPE BEAM
[4:52:14] <+Jaysky> So many flames
[4:52:14] <Sparty9112> this is just a Terraria boss now.
[4:52:14] <deviljhojho94> fuck those hurt super bad
[4:52:33] <xeros720> SPAM HEAL OF COURSE
[4:52:38] <%Shadicara> BRUTE FORCE
[4:52:40] <%floralkami> @jdebss the "vergil" comparison i made is that the character does the same moves as the player character, but better.
[4:53:00] <%arcielardor> @AngriestPat Dude you literally just got a shield power!
[4:53:04] <%RubberFistFight> @JDebss you know, Bed of Chaos was probably the weakest part of Dark Souls, but that doesn't mean that the bosses overall are the weakest link. Not every boss is gonna be awesome, and shitloads of great games have at least one embarrassing aspect. There's a huge gap between "one shitty boss" and "the bosses are the worst part".
[4:53:07] <%Punchasaur> are you serious
[4:53:09] <%SilvaChariot0133> Those fire trades are oof
[4:53:09] <Firesparks> youu should stack fire resist, that's the hardest to dodge
[4:53:10] <%KoyaMusa> the fire tracks, so it's better to slowly bait it

[4:54:05] <tigerfang86> CRAZY TALK HAS ACTIVATED!!!! [T R U T H] HAS BEEN ALTERED JOJO!!!!!
[4:54:06] <etoir> I hope it's not bugged now
[4:54:07] <%RubberFistFight> "GOTCHA BITCH!" Said the bosspope
[4:54:08] <%Soul_Intern> CRAZY TALK IS EVER LIVING
[4:54:11] <Firesparks> pope took control of YOUUR stand
[4:54:11] <xeros720> okay, we're good
[4:54:12] <Personified134> chat what does "last son of the miracle" actually MEAN in this context, or is that explained after you kill him
[4:54:15] <$notEisiger> You were hit by the big green booger that spawned on his head
[4:54:20] <NameNumber> You've got this shit.
[4:54:21] <cureneckbeard> haha and you said bitch even though you said you woudln't say bitch.
[4:54:22] <%tragicjohnson84> NOW-fight the Pope!
[4:54:24] <%Punchasaur> cumbo talk
[4:54:28] <JDebss> @floralkami Just saying it wasn't a very hype fight unlike Vergil
[4:54:29] <puse9> it makes you live a bit longer
[4:54:29] <%mh9s> i wish my face had contact damage
[4:54:37] <+BaronVonFatty> didnt you just get a spell that blocks projectiles
[4:54:37] <%lucaflow> "GOTCHA BITCH!" Yelled Pat as he died
[4:54:38] <%Zombrocom> Oh phase 1 is literally Dracula
[4:54:38] <Mendin> I think it means he is the last big manifestation of the miracle's blessing?
[4:54:44] <Valdorick> My face has ranged contact damage - you look at it, you take damage.
[4:54:52] <puse9> or an invulnerability spell
[4:54:53] <Bogart4321> Kureijītōku ga akutibu ni narimasu
[4:54:53] <nepwar> often overlooked fact is that your face can do contact damage if you're strong enough
[4:54:56] <NameNumber> @mh9s But you'd get no kisses.
[4:54:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat's greatest enemy truly is himself.
[4:55:06] <%hntronium> uhoh
[4:55:06] <Personified134> LUL
[4:55:07] <tigerfang86> YEAH IT WAS
[4:55:07] <%floralkami> @jdebss dude, NOTHING is a hype fight like Vergil. hence the name "the VERGIL"

[4:55:09] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:55:09] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat the final blood blade upgrade makes this boss trivially easy
[4:55:09] <+Caffieantedjedi> LUL

[4:55:16] <suikudo> why are you getting beat up by old man pope?
[4:55:17] <%Crushter> @Mendin this is the form he took physically, he makes you fight him in the Dream World to really kill him
[4:55:17] <+SamleyTimes> brute*
[4:55:19] <maybefalco> paige strats
[4:55:20] <deviljhojho94> Its already over
[4:55:21] <$notEisiger> vineBrainyot vineBrainyot vineBrainyot vineBrainyot
[4:55:21] <%The_Cassowary> I'm so proud pat lol
[4:55:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's right Pat, keep sliding into those.
[4:55:23] <xeros720> doing the same thing over and over has to work
[4:55:26] <etoir> SHAMEFUL
[4:55:26] <NameNumber> Like Tears in Rain.
[4:55:26] <ShadeTheNovice> beaten by an old man
[4:55:29] <%RubberFistFight> @waifoong98 OUR MEN ARE RUNNING FROM THE BATTLEFIELD
[4:55:29] <%Punchasaur> why you slide tackle a magics
[4:55:35] <%hntronium> Now win this at a handicap
[4:55:35] <waifoong98> @RubberFistFight LUL
[4:55:42] <%Crushter> he doesn't know
[4:55:45] <deviljhojho94> Funny you mention that
[4:55:45] <%arcielardor> The final boss looks like he's in an iron maiden
[4:55:49] <%Shadicara> It's a giant sword pat
[4:55:50] <%arcielardor> This game is so metal
[4:55:53] <beetbo2> LUL
[4:55:53] <%sl8r4l8r> protip: the sword can attack
[4:55:54] <suikudo> didnt know the sword could attack?
[4:55:54] <LodiFrostbeard> he thinks this isn't the big last boss
[4:56:03] <JDebss> @floralkami Ok? That's my point that it wasn't that great compared to the rest.
[4:56:08] <%tragicjohnson84> Tiny windows to hit head
[4:56:09] <+Jaysky> ***
[4:56:17] <Silly_Duckling> the sword hadn't attacked the last 2 times, I didn't think it could swing either
[4:56:20] <+nekodelic> @AngriestPat This is the big last boss
[4:56:33] <%tragicjohnson84> Literal fart bubbles
[4:56:35] <%Punchasaur> his nose is bleeding
[4:56:37] <Reook1> Fart gas in the pope mask
[4:56:45] <+Jaysky> I'm shocked the lightning didn't juggle him there
[4:56:49] <waifoong98> That lightning crap seems very annoying
[4:57:02] <%Zombrocom> This BOSS seems very annoying
[4:57:11] <NameNumber> Annoying, but pretty cool anyway.
[4:57:12] <waifoong98> @Zombrocom fair enough lol
[4:57:12] <$notEisiger> he used DI to escape the combo
[4:57:14] <+CaptainGrime> well its not sapost to be EZ
[4:57:15] <%floralkami> @jdebss what was the rest? dude, it's okay to not like me using Vergil as a rival character trope name, but get over it.
[4:57:17] <Valdorick> OOF
[4:57:29] <%Shadicara> LUL
[4:57:30] <%RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom well i mean, isn't that the point? Bosses aren't meant to make you feel happy and co-operate with you, they're meant to fuck with your shit and make you miserable.
[4:57:39] <+CaptainGrime> ^
[4:57:40] <suikudo> ded
[4:57:41] <+gralho> did he get the guilty statues?
[4:57:42] <beetbo2> LUL
[4:57:48] <%Mr_Strut> Pat's greatest weakness: slow tracking projectiles
[4:57:49] <%Noxyba> FIREBALL, FIREBALL, FIREBALL
[4:57:53] <%Zombrocom> I dunno, I thought they were supposed to be enjoyable challenges
[4:57:56] <Huntercd> Why does he look like the pope in an iron maiden?
[4:58:00] <$Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat I'll bet you $10 that that the face in the mask is one of the creators faces like Doom
[4:58:01] <NameNumber> Damn, dude.
[4:58:02] <waifoong98> Hadoukened
[4:58:02] <%Soul_Intern> Unlucky
[4:58:02] <+Jaysky> M o r t i s
[4:58:03] <CALLthaDoctah> can you hit the fireballs?
[4:58:03] <marvel877> ...
[4:58:04] <worldbrand> i dunno what you can do besides run
[4:58:06] <%probablypoisonous> MORTIS
[4:58:06] <Valdorick> He's spamming fireballs more than D&D wizards.
[4:58:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Didn
[4:58:07] <%Maids4lyfe> you need the shield spell
[4:58:08] <ahmz1404> why arent u using the prayer
[4:58:08] <xeros720> and pat was zoned out yet again
[4:58:08] <shevan123> fireballs are the worst ones
[4:58:08] <%WhereIsWill> whats worse the stunlock lighting or the fire
[4:58:08] <%Crushter> @Huntercd he is a pope in an iron maiden
[4:58:09] <+conradical> pat, use that invulnerability spell that you ahve? idk
[4:58:13] <GeneralUile42> use spell
[4:58:13] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> e'rybody in chat gettin heated 'bout the bosses
[4:58:14] <%Punchasaur> NotLikeThis
[4:58:14] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat the fire protection ins't doing much
[4:58:16] <%KoyaMusa> the fireballs can be strafed if you move slowly
[4:58:16] <Buzzard42> oh man did I come back in time for the final boss
[4:58:16] <$notEisiger> Fireballs are a god damn nightmare on Son
[4:58:18] <waifoong98> fucking shotos man Kappa
[4:58:18] <Tucker0603> why aren't you using your invulnerability spell?
[4:58:19] <LodiFrostbeard> @worldbrand zarabanda
[4:58:21] <%floralkami> this boss feels like an escalation of all the other bosses
[4:58:21] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Didn't pat get a spell to be invulnerable lol
[4:58:21] <JDebss> @floralkami I hadn't even talked about how you used his name I had talked to rubberfist. I'm not upset you're the one who told me to elaborate
[4:58:22] <%spacehouse> walk, don't run from fireballs
[4:58:23] <%Kiiper> don't you have two spells that handle projectiles for you?
[4:58:24] <%The_Cassowary> the fireballs might be a bit cheap imo
[4:58:26] <%RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom it's almost as if people enjoy different things. How strange.
[4:58:26] <nepwar> man it looks like you can parry those fireballs since it looks impossible to dodge
[4:58:29] <+gralho> wich ending is pat doing?
[4:58:29] <%Soul_Intern> Use the invi spell that you have when the fireballs start
[4:58:32] <NameNumber> He's got this shit. Just needs to put it all together for the big victory.
[4:58:33] <chambatron> More like the hidden missiles from Dr Doom
[4:58:35] <%Zombrocom> @RubberFistFight Why are angry?
[4:58:35] <%Shadicara> Pray to cumbo for help
[4:58:40] <%Thelastofthemohicans> Time for this jobber again.
[4:58:48] <Valdorick> Pat will now spite ignore any call to use the invuln spell
[4:58:49] <%SirGO0SE> ya the floor is slippery
[4:58:50] <xeros720> oh yeah, since they are player tracking, that makes sense
[4:58:52] <%senorpapel> Cool, i didn’t miss the final boss
[4:59:04] <%RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom lol are you for real? What part of my response indicates anger?
[4:59:08] <%Crushter> huh
[4:59:10] <+CaptainGrime> @senorpapel you ready for GIGA POPE
[4:59:12] <%Crushter> those don't actually hurt him
[4:59:14] <%moogleboy1984> I'MMA HIT YOU WIT YA OWN PIMP
[4:59:20] <waifoong98> This guy gives me sanctus vibe
[4:59:22] <AzirothTheGreat> Y don't u use, invinciblity? goblins?
[4:59:23] <+Jaysky> This fight is going longer than before
[4:59:31] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat $10 says the face in the mask is one of the creators faces
[4:59:34] <%KoyaMusa> the fireballs track so that if you run you tend to make them inescapable, walking gives you a way out
[4:59:35] <%CrezaK> What was the nuke move that you used on your first attempt?
[4:59:36] <%WhereIsWill> ah yes, halo syndrome
[4:59:37] <NameNumber> Sanctus, but less? pathetic.
[4:59:38] <JDebss> you just gotta rush him
[4:59:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Cumbo is down
[4:59:40] <Huntercd> Dark pope fights for the amusement of light pope?
[4:59:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Inverse Prog is real
[4:59:44] <+Ell1ot> it seems like you run out of room faster when you run from fireballs
[4:59:47] <%Zombrocom> It seemed to me your words implied a condescending/sarcastic tone, which I felt was unwarrented from my statements. my bad If I am wrong
[4:59:50] <%Mr_Pylon> Use your invincibility when fireballs are out
[4:59:56] <beetbo2> Maybe it’s exhaustion
[4:59:56] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat you're on the downward slope, it's an inverse bell curve. Soon you'll hit the bottom and then start climbing back up.
[5:00:06] <beetbo2> You’ve been running for a while
[5:00:09] <waifoong98> @NameNumber yeah, this guy is missing that cartoonishly evil laugh hah
[5:00:11] <%The_Cassowary> in 5 minutes I turn 30, let the existential crisis begin!
[5:00:13] <%RubberFistFight> @Zombrocom your misinterpretation of my words is on you, nobody else.
[5:00:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Nah, he'll break new ground and suck more.
[5:00:18] <$notEisiger> it's pat chat, being passive aggressive is mandatory
[5:00:29] <%Zombrocom> @RubberFistFight Dude, you are kinda being a dick for no reason right now.
[5:00:41] <marvel877> SCOOPS
[5:00:41] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight also, he just apologized, and that is antagonistic language.
[5:00:41] <Ominnous> nice oki
[5:00:43] <%floralkami> @jdebss sorry, i lost the thread, but i finished my part after i explained why vergil was a good description, which Rubberfist agreed
[5:00:47] <Huntercd> Elmo give Pat your support
[5:00:48] <JDebss> dark souls syndrome where you get worse at the fight as you get more practiced
[5:00:52] <Ominnous> marvel combos over here

[5:02:52] <tigerfang86> DO CUMBO PAT
[5:02:56] <%Shadicara> The real miracle is the cumbos we had along the way
[5:02:57] <%floralkami> @lodifrostbeard why are the boss fights the weakest part of the game?
[5:03:03] <marvel877> Why can't he do good cumbo???
[5:03:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> is this the true ending or are we still just fighting him
[5:03:05] <$notEisiger> at this point you're just kind of a retard

[5:03:50] <marvel877> Does knocking back the toxin do any damage to the boss or is he unaffected?
[5:03:53] <%RubberFistFight> @FuzzTime this is Wolnir after he's had his morning coffee.
[5:04:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Chat needs to be cool.
[5:04:03] <LodiFrostbeard> @floralkami they're easy and repetitive, the exploration and the art make the bosses look lame in comparison, i can't belive you were angry at that opinion
[5:04:03] <tigerfang86> ^
[5:04:04] <JDebss> @floralkami lol what? I was joking calm you shit kid

[5:04:49] <%Binary_Fireball> Binary_Fireball subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Pat you have a choice of all porn becoming feet or all porn becoming skeletons, what do you choose?

[5:05:01] <%Zombrocom> That fireball attack seems like the biggest threat by far
[5:05:02] <StonerStan101> Pretty Metal.
[5:05:03] <Valdorick> Pet the Elmo to cleanse the bad spirits.
[5:05:07] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat i think you're safe from it
[5:05:11] <xeros720> god damn, that greed
[5:05:11] <%Crushter> this is funny, I had biggest trouble with femVergil and I cleaned house on this boss

[5:05:18] <%SummonerMagno> Kill that pope
[5:05:21] <%Shadicara> Pat just play perfectly and you'll do it Kappa
[5:05:21] <+JacktheMan18> I'm guessing he can't reflect the fireballs which is unfortunate
[5:05:23] <cosmicgoatee> Pat learn to channel Cumbo
[5:05:26] <%Kiiper> NICE
[5:05:27] <beetbo2> Elmo, give us your holy light!!
[5:05:31] <%floralkami> @lodifrostbeard no one is angry at your opinion, we just wondered where you vanished to when we asked why you thought the bosses are easy and repetitive.
[5:05:35] <+FuzzTime> Just don't get hit 4Head
[5:05:37] <%Soul_Intern> Popi
[5:05:37] <%Crushter> @JacktheMan18 you can with a sword heart in the true end path
[5:05:38] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat and now you're on your way back up the bell curve.
[5:05:39] <%SirGO0SE> POPI!
[5:05:42] <waifoong98> You can dew it Pat, don't lose to this old fart Kappa
[5:05:43] <%Soul_Intern> Papi Popi
[5:05:43] <$notEisiger> Wowee
[5:05:45] <NameNumber> Big Popi.
[5:05:46] <%KoyaMusa> go to an edge of the screen during fireballs then walk to avoid
[5:05:47] <%RubberFistFight> AY POPI
[5:05:48] <%SirGO0SE> Go, popi!
[5:05:50] <Silly_Duckling> fireballs look like they track your position, so stutter-stepping seems to be the way, but what do I know?
[5:05:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> \`[T] / GIVE PAT YOUR ENERGY
[5:05:52] <%Monkeyweed21> use your INVINCIBLE SPELL or the one that reflects projectiles
[5:05:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pope Stumbo, gonna get the Cumbo!
[5:05:56] <+JacktheMan18> Oh cool
[5:05:56] <atravelbee> @Binary_Fireball I would rather die than deal with feet
[5:05:57] <Huntercd> Iron Pope
[5:06:08] <NameNumber> Everybody knows is, the PS3 has the best games.
[5:06:09] <implied_consent> If you like games with Catholic imagery, I recommend Grezzo 2
[5:06:11] <%SummonerMagno> Summon jeezus for the assist
[5:06:11] <%Shadicara> Give pat the cumbo so he can't stumbo
[5:06:12] <beetbo2> Time to fight the ultimate boomer: the pope!
[5:06:23] <%SirGO0SE> wish you could play as galford in every game
[5:06:25] <%Zombrocom> Didn't pat get a fireball reflect spell from FemVirgil? Almost feels like it's intended for this fight
[5:06:28] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight does it work the same on mobile?
[5:06:54] <deviljhojho94> True suffering
[5:07:03] <%derekwst3> this reminds me of kirby
[5:07:04] <$notEisiger> Thorned Hairs prayer basically just means free damage/ignore fireballs
[5:07:06] <LodiFrostbeard> @floralkami why would i spend any ammount of time justifying myself to your passive aggressive ass, you need to chill man
[5:07:13] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Heal to FULL, man, ffs.
[5:07:14] <%Crushter> @Zombrocom its from the woman
[5:07:18] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami you should have a little speech bubble icon in the top right, click it and it'll bring you to a pane that has "friends" on one tab and "whispers" on the other.
[5:07:25] <Valdorick> The random Platform spawn is the true final boss.
[5:07:25] <%Crushter> @LodiFrostbeard u mad
[5:07:29] <%Zombrocom> You guys still going?
[5:07:33] <%Kilagn> He's gonna do it boys PogChamp

[5:07:43] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Does no one in chat know how to stop being a dick and just let it go? Wild shit man.
[5:07:44] <%mh9s> he might got it
[5:07:44] <LodiFrostbeard> @Crushter no u
[5:07:47] <+Jaysky> That was your best fire dodge before
[5:07:48] <implied_consent> I was here
[5:07:48] <%Zombrocom> Lets all stoip yelling at each other, yeah?
[5:07:50] <cureneckbeard> yeyeye
[5:07:51] <Silly_Duckling> I mean, you can probably do the fight without the spell, it'd be crazy if you couldn't. Maybe that's Pat's plan, do it spell-less
[5:07:51] <%Punchasaur> you guys are all being petty
[5:07:51] <beetbo2> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[5:07:52] <Mendin> This chatroom is our punishment under the Miracle
[5:07:52] <+Jaysky> You got this one
[5:07:53] <LeafarOznolam> Is PAt killing the thing with the power or Religion?
[5:07:53] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @notEisiger Oh, ok. Didn't know.
[5:07:57] <%RubberFistFight> @LodiFrostbeard wait, you basically call them a nobody, and then throw out "passive aggressive ass", and THEY'RE the ones who need to chill?
[5:07:58] <beetbo2> You can do it!!!
[5:08:01] <Paperware> man the fire is the worst since it just stops any kind of progress in the fight
[5:08:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Mendin You got that right.
[5:08:06] <+Jaysky> If only Pat had GUN
[5:08:09] <deviljhojho94> dont get cocky
[5:08:13] <waifoong98> god damn zoners reeee

[5:08:46] <nepwar> the fireballs is the real boss
[5:08:46] <implied_consent> Do it again pat.
[5:08:46] <ahmz1404> since your always on low life why not use the high attack damage low health thing
[5:08:46] <%Zombrocom> Can you just stack fire resist?
[5:08:47] <Casinoroyale80> USE SPELL
[5:08:48] <%Laecerelius> try to use a defensive prayer?
[5:08:48] <puse9> use your spells
[5:08:49] <deviljhojho94> I assume the shield thing is not working
[5:08:50] <%Soul_Intern> You can do it PAt
[5:08:53] <%Shadicara> Pat put that spell on that reflects projectiles yo
[5:08:54] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat just a question, why aren't you using your prayers?
[5:08:54] <%nmaten> easy mode now selectable
[5:08:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat You have a anit-fire spell from vergil
[5:08:57] <%Thelastofthemohicans> >inb4 The Run
[5:08:57] <%The_Cassowary> your healing trick works pretty well
[5:09:00] <asurite_warrior> BE Aggressive be eee aggressive
[5:09:00] <beetbo2> I believe in you
[5:09:01] <$notEisiger> dodge doesn't have iframe from everything
[5:09:02] <+Fnir> fireballs like in shmups
[5:09:04] <%moogleboy1984> the dodge doesn't work against immaterial projectiles
[5:09:08] <JDebss> @floralkami Let it go kid
[5:09:09] <%Divryne> Shiiieeet.
[5:09:13] <+johnny_volcano> Damn zoners, ruining the meta
[5:09:15] <%tweedler92> You know what does tho? Invincibility spell
[5:09:18] <%TheBitingIrish> Try the prayer you got from the lady just outside
[5:09:21] <%moogleboy1984> does he have Heart of the Single Tone?
[5:09:25] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yeah i think @King_Wolf_Rigger is right, you got a thing for that off the shiny chrome bitch you wrecked before.
[5:09:28] <$notEisiger> there's 3 beads for fire resist, and a core allows you to smack them away
[5:09:28] <beetbo2> Elmo believes in you Pat! OhMyDog
[5:09:33] <%floralkami> @jdebss didn't i give you a dick to eat?
[5:09:37] <NameNumber> Elmo always beleived.
[5:09:40] <asurite_warrior> the more you spend time healing the more fire you need to dodge
[5:09:41] <Huntercd> Blessed are the Elmo may he shine on stream
[5:09:45] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Pat on a no prayer run on this boss out of pure spite to chat lmao
[5:09:46] <%derekwst3> @AngriestPat what about the new prayer?
[5:09:46] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat just a question, why aren't you using your prayers?
[5:09:49] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat I don't remember him doing the fireballs that much but I had maxed the sword and was doing what you are with the air combos so it didn't take as long
[5:09:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Pat can't read anymore, he too concentrated. Like frozen OJ.
[5:09:57] <JDebss> @floralkami Go to bed child
[5:09:58] <%Punchasaur> reee explain yourself to me, for I am twitchboy, lord of the gamers!
[5:10:00] <%Zombrocom> Annnnnd those guys are still yelling at each other

[5:10:29] <+FuzzTime> HE NEEDS IT FOR LATER

[5:11:13] <%Laecerelius> SO USE THE DEFENSIVE ONES!!
[5:11:21] <%Zombrocom> Oh!
[5:11:21] <Mendin> So there's a German musical group called E Nomine that has some good goth Gregorian trance stuff
[5:11:22] <$notEisiger> The column is by far the worst miracle btw. mostly for tiny trash moblins

[5:21:57] <puse9> start at the library, go all the way to the roof to the prison and lastly go to the cistern and near the cliff area @AngriestPat
[5:21:58] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Which you WILL.
[5:21:58] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat I went to Sleeping canvases, then went up to WAall of Prohibitions, took the gondola to the covent of charred vissage then down to mountains of endless dusk then back to desectated cistern
[5:22:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Game: "You thought you won? GLITCH OUT FOREVER"
[5:22:02] <%Punchasaur> @rubberfistfight I was debating on saying that
[5:22:04] <%WhereIsWill> religion is metal af thats the truth of it
[5:22:04] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Painting first (since it's hardest to get out of with the spikes), the jail via the convent, then mountains
[5:22:15] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> !uptime
[5:22:15] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 22m.
[5:22:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @JDebss You ready for the sequel?
[5:22:33] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Less instadeath spikes that route
[5:22:34] <puse9> its a grat plan
[5:22:35] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> Jesus 5 hours?
[5:22:36] <$notEisiger> it's a good plan, because SPIKE TRAPS
[5:22:40] <puse9> *great
[5:22:42] <Mendin> Also Pat check your rosary beads for a second
[5:22:47] <%moogleboy1984> I would HIGHLY suggest using a Prie Deiu near where you start and not stopping at any others
[5:22:51] <JDebss> @King_Wolf_Rigger So fucking ready!
[5:22:58] <%floralkami> i really wanna go back and see if that body double combo finisher on Vergil was a real thing
[5:22:59] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Victorian Medusa Heads??
[5:23:04] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> How much closer are you to the end of the game? @angriestpat
[5:23:15] <+wolfofshokan> I just tuned in and holy shit this game's soundtrack is good
[5:23:22] <$notEisiger> You just lost your good ending Kappa
[5:23:23] <puse9> die again to make it black
[5:23:24] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Can't wait for the weirdness of a DP2.
[5:23:27] <%moogleboy1984> you broke your Ring of Sacrifice

[5:23:41] <Mendin> I dont think he'll need to die, he'll just... eventually die
[5:23:49] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat that tainted guilt you need to wear when destroying the guilt shrines but do that last as there will be no way to reclaim guilt afterwards
[5:23:50] <%floralkami> @xxx_wiiuboss_xxx he just got the first ending

[5:24:43] <worldbrand> I will be here to chuckle at/with you
[5:24:44] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> @floralkami Ok, so did he already get the good ending?
[5:24:45] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat to cause a guy to spawn save at a shine and head to the right, that's the only way to make them spawn

[5:25:30] <Xxx_wiiuboss_xxx> @floralkami ok, thanks
[5:25:31] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat that bead is for guilt shrines only, unequip it and put something useful on like the one that increases dodge distance
[5:25:40] <+IMCthulhu> not nearly enough

[5:25:57] <JDebss> lol that needs a sonic animation
[5:25:57] <MistahMrMatt> i can never judge his deaths my dumbass is willing to face check any death traps
[5:25:59] <%sl8r4l8r> Patience is indeed a virtue
[5:26:12] <deviljhojho94> What is the name of the colors he is wearing?

[5:26:16] <deviljhojho94> Something something guilt?
[5:26:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @JDebss I want to know which of that character we'll be getting? The one who died at the end or the one who was the original.
[5:26:17] <$notEisiger> I got 96% completion before realizing I didn't need to do all of this shit for the ending
[5:26:18] <Mendin> True Apostacy
[5:26:19] <+IMCthulhu> diaLUL
[5:26:23] <deviljhojho94> man thats fucking sick
[5:26:32] <$notEisiger> but this road was 'fun'
[5:26:37] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat with dodge distance and dodge cooldown on you can spam dodge for faster movement
[5:26:58] <$notEisiger> suck on them toes, penetant one
[5:27:07] <%Punchasaur> John blasphemous for Smash
[5:27:07] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Save at a Prie Dieu here since if anything goes big stumbo you're back at the starting point
[5:27:09] <JDebss> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah that's what makes me think it's retconned.
[5:27:10] <%WhereIsWill> that a rough ass BAD END tho
[5:27:13] <%moogleboy1984> use the bonfire down here
[5:27:14] <%WhereIsWill> like, you get NOTHING
[5:27:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I've driven on some pretty rough roads, I can handle what you got.
[5:27:24] <Mendin> No teleporter, correct
[5:27:31] <deviljhojho94> At least his penance was over tho
[5:27:34] <deviljhojho94> That is something, no
[5:27:40] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat the enemies you want in sleeping canvas only spawn when you are entering from the left
[5:27:45] <$notEisiger> @AngriestPat I didn't test it, but you could possibly maybe quit to menu in order to spawn back at the last per dieu
[5:27:47] <%floralkami> @whereiswill honestly, i expected less
[5:27:55] <GeneralUile42> use invunerable spell
[5:27:56] <GiygasDrillBreak> it can work
[5:27:56] <Morbidmort> @deviljhojho94 not when so many suffer still
[5:28:04] <CrystalLightPeachTea> SAME PIT
[5:28:05] <%moogleboy1984> 14
[5:28:07] <Mendin> Oh that makes sence as they're huge and guard the leftmost door

[5:28:12] <karl_rex> Yeah!
[5:28:12] <xeros720> rip
[5:28:13] <%WhereIsWill> thats fair
[5:28:15] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[5:28:16] <Ominnous> remember women aren't sharp
[5:28:17] <deviljhojho94> @Morbidmort Well but compared to dark souls at least its over
[5:28:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> because quitting to menu and reload does NOT empty the cup
[5:28:21] <%moogleboy1984> yes
[5:28:24] <katocrimson> remind's me a bit of sen's fortress
[5:28:27] <LodiFrostbeard> YES
[5:28:29] <deviljhojho94> OOF
[5:28:34] <%HibikiYamada> so, what's the repercussion of dying?
[5:28:36] <%floralkami> YO

[5:28:54] <Buzzard42> F
[5:28:55] <Mendin> Or you can go to the Prie Dieu at the start of this area
[5:28:57] <JDebss> wow
[5:28:58] <%Ion_Laser> yup
[5:28:59] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @JDebss The reason I don't think it needs to be retconned, is that Zach is still capable of being a detective, and we follow Francis, well, those are just Heaven crimes being solved lol. Here's hoping they keep it all legit and find a way to make it work.
[5:28:59] <Silly_Duckling> nailed it
[5:28:59] <%floralkami> Pat
[5:29:00] <MKUltima> PartyTime
[5:29:01] <MattDemers> I would've tilted the fuck out of this game by now.

[5:29:04] <CrystalLightPeachTea> I think that was the same pit, AGAIN

[5:29:33] <%luftraumm1> @angriestpat take the easier path, less pits
[5:29:33] <doggieo> We need a miracle
[5:29:35] <+NoGoodAtGames> Its Literally one button to jump, Cumbo
[5:29:42] <%floralkami> maybe you need sleep
[5:29:45] <%rubbishbinge> !uptime
[5:29:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 5h 29m.
[5:29:49] <%The_Cassowary> but pat suffering is the only true way to be godly ;)
[5:29:51] <Blu_C> Look at it this way, this is just punishment for your sins.
[5:29:53] <cureneckbeard> People of chat! Give Pat your power! abipopPANTSU
[5:29:55] <%moogleboy1984> Remember your DS training. If you tilt, you'll lose.
[5:30:00] <%floralkami> okay, yeah just tank the hit
[5:30:03] <Tersalus> yaaay!
[5:30:03] <CrystalLightPeachTea> WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
[5:30:05] <JDebss> @King_Wolf_Rigger Yeah I really hope so. That teaser trailer with York talking to Zack gave me so much hope
[5:30:13] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> I haven't watched much of the game or know much about it, but seeing spikes being instant death to checkpoint tells me this game is fucked
[5:30:14] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat After sleeping canvases everything is easier
[5:30:17] <$notEisiger> @AngriestPat if you have it, use the Prayer to turn invincible against the pendulums
[5:30:25] <+RiceeFTW> LUL
[5:30:29] <cosmicgoatee> @angriestpat do you feel your sins crawling on your back
[5:30:31] <Mendin> Remember that you also need to Not Die
[5:30:37] <+RiceeFTW> just git gud
[5:30:56] <%moogleboy1984> do NOT use any other bonefires if you can help it
[5:30:59] <%marsano168> But what if he needs the magic for later??????
[5:31:08] <LodiFrostbeard> @moogleboy1984 why?
[5:31:10] <ahmz1404> try not to die
[5:31:11] <$notEisiger> if he fucks up, he can just use a warp back
[5:31:13] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat just take your time and go the easy way up to wall of prohibitions
[5:31:16] <%moogleboy1984> because if you happen to die along the way, you'll need to backtrack all the way back down here
[5:31:23] <LodiFrostbeard> clever
[5:31:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @JDebss Fingers crossed. It's gonna be a mindfuck either way lol.
[5:31:41] <JDebss> yup
[5:31:51] <Mendin> @AngriestPat I might put on the Golden Dont-Die-To-Pits if you're going to go up the Mother of Mothers
[5:31:58] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @moogleboy1984 Does he actually need to kill them all in one life?
[5:32:06] <%moogleboy1984> @CrystalLightPeachTea yes
[5:32:07] <+RiceeFTW> yes
[5:32:13] <ahmz1404> this is like the WHITE FLOWER quest in hollow knight
[5:32:16] <%moogleboy1984> mercifully, he can take damage
[5:32:17] <%derekwst3> so what does he have to do for good ending?
[5:32:21] <%RubberFistFight> ey I'm back, did you kill the Great Satan yet Pat?
[5:32:25] <%Soul_Intern> @ahmz1404 Except for babies
[5:32:25] <%moogleboy1984> so it's not as bad as the flower quest
[5:32:25] <%Punchasaur> why does my weenis tingle when I sneeze
[5:32:25] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Neevr played Hollow Night yet.
[5:32:45] <ahmz1404> whats better? grubmos or babies?
[5:32:46] <%The_Cassowary> Hollow Knight is the best imo
[5:32:47] <cosmicgoatee> white flower was no damage or flower breaks, this is a similar vein but your life
[5:32:49] <MKUltima> @Punchasaur It just means it's going to fall off if you sneeze too hard
[5:32:53] <%Soul_Intern> @CrystalLightPeachTea Good game
[5:32:58] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Punchasaur Because of CUMBO
[5:33:00] <Mendin> Grubmos hands fucking down cmon
[5:33:01] <%RubberFistFight> @cosmicgoatee you couldn't use the stagway either, you had to do it all live.
[5:33:02] <Mendin> There is no contest
[5:33:03] <%moogleboy1984> if you're just getting into Metroidvanias, do NOT start with Hollow Knight
[5:33:05] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @Soul_Intern I know, I own it.
[5:33:10] <%moogleboy1984> it will spoil you for its greatness
[5:33:10] <ahmz1404> that is true
[5:33:15] <%Soul_Intern> @CrystalLightPeachTea PLAY
[5:33:22] <LodiFrostbeard> @moogleboy1984 i don't even remember what the reward for this is
[5:33:26] <%Punchasaur> I've heard a sneeze is 1/8 of a cumbo
[5:33:29] <$notEisiger> if you're just getting into metroidvanias, ONLY play Hollow Knight
[5:33:30] <Mendin> For the chalice quest?
[5:33:32] <%moogleboy1984> the last Mea Culpa upgrade
[5:33:37] <Mendin> ^
[5:33:38] <cosmicgoatee> too late @moogleboy1984 im suffering with NKG NotLikeThis
[5:33:40] <%RubberFistFight> @moogleboy1984 honestly anybody looking to get into metroidvania should start with either metroid or castlevania. There's a reason the genre is named after them.
[5:33:41] <CrystalLightPeachTea> If I can't make me, what makes you think YOU can?
[5:33:42] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Go through the shortcut of the wall and then head down to the lion headed guy
[5:33:53] <%The_Cassowary> @RubberFistFight You could use the trams but they weren't super helpful with the flower as I found out lol
[5:33:56] <%Soul_Intern> @CrystalLightPeachTea Cumbo
[5:33:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If you're getting Hollow Knights, only play Metroid and Castlevania.
[5:33:57] <Tersalus> imagine doing a challenge like this when you're exhausted, in front of 1,000 people? props to pat
[5:34:01] <+RiceeFTW> imagine never having played Castlevania or Metroid
[5:34:02] <%moogleboy1984> Castlevania 2 with a retranslation patch imo
[5:34:17] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat Go Slowly up this vertical path
[5:34:21] <%floralkami> @punchasaur well you wee son, when a young person grows up they get feelings and tingles in their bodies. That's the devil in you trying to get out, but you gotta keep it in so you dont taint the world in your sin
[5:34:24] <Mendin> Zero Mission, Metroid Fusion, SotN, Hollow Knight
[5:34:24] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @Soul_Intern I only got here in the last hour, so I have no idea what a Cumbo is.
[5:34:28] <%RubberFistFight> @RiceeFTW well Pat's on record as not liking Metroid at all. Except for Prime, i think?
[5:34:33] <ahmz1404> take your time
[5:34:33] <%WhereIsWill> find your true zen pat, which is elmo apatElmo
[5:34:33] <%Soul_Intern> @CrystalLightPeachTea Cumbo
[5:34:39] <%firehawk_420> I’ve never played castlevania or metroid
[5:34:40] <ahmz1404> eliminate threats
[5:34:42] <+RiceeFTW> @RubberFistFight yeah but never having played it?
[5:34:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Imagine thinking Castlevania started at FOUR
[5:34:46] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @Soul_Intern Koopy Sandwich
[5:34:50] <%firehawk_420> Regrettably
[5:35:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> WE DON'T TALK ABOUT KOOPY
[5:35:00] <%RubberFistFight> @RiceeFTW i'm 36 and i've never played castlevania, so it's not THAT unusual.
[5:35:03] <%Soul_Intern> Now dont die here Pat
[5:35:07] <%moogleboy1984> whew
[5:35:10] <+RiceeFTW> @RubberFistFight but you've played metroid?
[5:35:13] <Buzzard42> Castlevania started at 3
[5:35:15] <%SirGO0SE> metroid fusions is excellent i cant imagine pat not liking that one
[5:35:15] <deviljhojho94> real talk, what would koopy taste like
[5:35:16] <%Punchasaur> @floralkami is the devil in my cumbo?
[5:35:25] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat you passed the hardest parts of this run
[5:35:35] <%RubberFistFight> @RiceeFTW played it and loved the shit out of it, except for Other M because that's a fucking diarrhettic turd of a game.
[5:35:48] <Mendin> Well, get the Lion first
[5:35:52] <%floralkami> @punchasaur yes son, the devil is in all of our cumbos
[5:35:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @deviljhojho94 Apparently, Koopy sandwiches were made with that tiny Koopy lizard in the lizard tanks in the game.
[5:36:02] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat it's smooth sailing as long as you dont let a monster kill you
[5:36:05] <Mendin> Thy're everywhere
[5:36:06] <%moogleboy1984> next room, go down
[5:36:08] <JDebss> Castlevania was always good but GODDAMN Symphony of the night!
[5:36:09] <ahmz1404> in the middle
[5:36:10] <%RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 koopy is basically a lizard, right? So probably vaguely chickeny.
[5:36:11] <+RiceeFTW> @RubberFistFight so I mean it's pretty rare for someone to have never played Metroid AND Castlevania
[5:36:14] <GiygasDrillBreak> stairways
[5:36:15] <%Punchasaur> cumbo sandwich
[5:36:17] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat straight down from there
[5:36:18] <GiygasDrillBreak> bottom of stairs
[5:36:25] <%RubberFistFight> @RiceeFTW fair point.
[5:36:31] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @AngriestPat If the Devil gave you a magic pimp cane, but wanted you to marry his ugly daughter, would you do it? For the purpose of this scenario, Paige doesn't exist.
[5:36:31] <Mendin> That second door, I think
[5:36:32] <%RubberFistFight> could still happen though.
[5:36:32] <alexandrecau> koopy must taste like simili turkey
[5:36:34] <Mendin> Also
[5:36:42] <deviljhojho94> @RubberFistFight i would be into it ngl
[5:36:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CrystalLightPeachTea That was a good movie
[5:37:10] <deviljhojho94> @King_Wolf_Rigger I tasted snake once, real tasty stuff so it could be similar
[5:37:10] <%Bluwizard21> Anyone remember where those last two children of moonlight are? He can get them on his way to the guilt shrines
[5:37:15] <%floralkami> @punchasaur now take this whip and head on outside for your daily tear excretion
[5:37:18] <pabloelenano2> breath man dont worry
[5:37:19] <%RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 sure, eating reptile flesh is totally a thing. People eat crocs, gators, snakes and turtles all the damn time. It's still meat, even if it's not mammalian in origin.
[5:37:22] <ahmz1404> use the charge slash
[5:37:26] <lionmanguy> Nervous about what?
[5:37:28] <ZE_Count> Your fine probably
[5:37:31] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @deviljhojho94 Aw you lucky dawg.
[5:37:34] <Mendin> It's the easy street fro here, no more spikes
[5:37:38] <CrystalLightPeachTea> 2/3
[5:37:39] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat head back up across the gondola and then down to abelo
[5:37:39] <GiygasDrillBreak> take the chairlift to convent
[5:37:44] <%moogleboy1984> you've already beat the hardest part of this challenge
[5:37:45] <%Punchasaur> @floralkami cmonBruh
[5:37:47] <%arcaderabbit48> I have had alligator tail before. It tastes like fish, with the texture of chicken
[5:37:50] <deviljhojho94> @RubberFistFight yeah you know how cajuns sometimes cook alligators and shit tomatoCool real tasty
[5:37:50] <%WhereIsWill> whats the challenge?
[5:37:53] <Mendin> Just gondola to the convent, work your way down, and elevator - town - sewer - mountain - doe
[5:37:54] <%Kiiper> snake, alligator and croc are pretty good
[5:37:55] <ahmz1404> dont let him relax
[5:37:56] <%firehawk_420> You got this Pat
[5:38:01] <+Epic_Fubar> full faith pat!
[5:38:04] <%Soul_Intern> WOO BOY
[5:38:05] <%arcielardor> So I'm lost, what's he trying to do?
[5:38:08] <%Soul_Intern> THAT WAS CLOSE
[5:38:10] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight oh yeah, we DEFINITELY got gator meat here in south Florida
[5:38:12] <%RubberFistFight> @deviljhojho94 well croc hunting is a thing here in Australia too, we have shitloads of em, so yeah.
[5:38:13] <cureneckbeard> Have lucky faith
[5:38:19] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I've had 'gator jerky. It was pretty good.
[5:38:20] <%Bluwizard21> Did pat get the cherub at the beginning of the game?
[5:38:22] <tigerfang86> Lucky ___
[5:38:27] <Tersalus> shut your crazy talkin mouth, pat! its dangerous!
[5:38:27] <Mendin> Yeah he got that
[5:38:30] <ZE_Count> just have patience pat and stop jumping in the elevators JESUS!

[5:38:32] <%Kiiper> 31 months? holy shit
[5:38:35] <tigerfang86> huh, I thought I remembered a name for a second there....
[5:38:38] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Just teleport to the spots hggPeanut
[5:38:39] <tigerfang86> hmm.....
[5:38:44] <%torontototoro> Easier or harder than the flower challenge in Hollow Knight?
[5:38:51] <+RiceeFTW> @FrostedZaibatsu hggGANG
[5:38:54] <Mendin> @FrostedZaibatsu Auto-fails if you teleport
[5:38:55] <GiygasDrillBreak> easier than flower
[5:38:56] <%moogleboy1984> Mea Kappa
[5:38:56] <LodiFrostbeard> @torontototoro easier
[5:39:00] <+FrostedZaibatsu> hggGANG hggGANG hggGANG hggWoke
[5:39:01] <ahmz1404> and down we go
[5:39:04] <GiygasDrillBreak> he's almost done
[5:39:08] <Mendin> This challenge you can get -hit-
[5:39:20] <%Bluwizard21> did he get the cherub at the bottom of the greivance ascends that you need the root vines to get?
[5:39:20] <GiygasDrillBreak> make sure the abyss relic is on
[5:39:22] <Mendin> Yet another way that this game pales in comparison to Hollow Knight
[5:39:24] <%Punchasaur> look at those shovel Knight cauldrons
[5:39:25] <%dr_diddy> dr_diddy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[5:39:29] <%WhereIsWill> at least in this you can heal lol
[5:39:31] <MattDemers> Did he do the flower challenge?
[5:39:34] <cosmicgoatee> it is easier than the flower but also spike floors man
[5:39:47] <%torontototoro> did Pat eat shit super hard on the flower challenge? I must've missed watching him stream that
[5:39:48] <%RubberFistFight> @Mendin hollow knight sets the bar very high though, lets be fair.
[5:39:57] <Mendin> Yeah I screamed at him to put that on as soon as he got out of the library
[5:39:58] <cureneckbeard> They eat shit so we may feast
[5:40:02] <%moogleboy1984> he's doing it right now @torontototoro
[5:40:02] <%Bluwizard21> what is the flower challenge?
[5:40:13] <ahmz1404> who's hype for silksong?
[5:40:14] <GiygasDrillBreak> yeah as long as the abyss relic is on, pat cant possibly die
[5:40:15] <+RiceeFTW> it's hard to live up to Hollow Knight, even Bloodstained couldn't do that
[5:40:16] <GobblesInTheMist> So is pat mid game? Or end game?
[5:40:17] <deviljhojho94> eyes peeled for those chubby fuckers
[5:40:17] <%hntronium> does resting at a shrine fuck up the challenge?
[5:40:24] <%hntronium> @GobblesInTheMist end game
[5:40:25] <%moogleboy1984> double end game
[5:40:29] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat did you get the cherub at the bottom of greivance ascends before the altasgracias?
[5:40:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> end game af
[5:40:38] <%RubberFistFight> @Bluwizard21 get a flower from the grey mourner and transport it to her lover's grave without taking damage or using the tramways.
[5:40:39] <LodiFrostbeard> @Bluwizard21 Hollow knight has a similar challenge in which you can't get hit
[5:40:42] <%fatalDestiny> Flower challenge was easy, if you did it before they patched the enemies not respawning.
[5:40:42] <Mendin> We are in endgame-postgame
[5:40:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @AngriestPat Can you use the teleport machines to make this easier?
[5:40:52] <%Bluwizard21> oh hollow knight
[5:40:53] <%torontototoro> @Bluwizard21 In Hollow Knight you need to transport a delicate flower (don't get hit) from a character on one end of the map to a grave on the other end. no fast travel
[5:40:54] <%moogleboy1984> getting back to Grievance Ascends is ass
[5:40:56] <Mendin> There's probably a baby in Jondo so Grievous Ascends will be nearby
[5:40:57] <GobblesInTheMist> Wow
[5:40:57] <%AncelDeLambert> that sounds like apatGoblin
[5:40:58] <%Bluwizard21> yeah that one was fun
[5:41:01] <lilfrazzy> Did he ever save he suffering chick?
[5:41:02] <%hntronium> @King_Wolf_Rigger No teleporting
[5:41:04] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Pat did the Tower of Pain tho
[5:41:10] <deviljhojho94> lots of wacky bullshit for this ending
[5:41:11] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's rough
[5:41:14] <+FrostedZaibatsu> Path of pain
[5:41:14] <%torontototoro> God I can
[5:41:21] <%torontototoro> can't wait for Silksong
[5:41:23] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> the end of the flower quest forces you to go thru a series of small spike corridors. can't believe that bullshit
[5:41:25] <ahmz1404> gg ez
[5:41:25] <deviljhojho94> Ohohoho hell yeah

[5:44:42] <Mendin> Getting all the confessor statues is basically a world trip anyway so the baby hunt is part and parcel
[5:44:47] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @torontototoro It's basically the Blood Angels from Warhammer 40k.
[5:44:49] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat ill keep looking

[5:49:18] <Morbidmort> @Maids4lyfe And where the Grievous Miracle began
[5:49:23] <tigerfang86> Despacito
[5:49:27] <%SirGO0SE> i believe that means 'step on my balls"
[5:49:30] <+lordsdb> that range attack keeps making me think of inyuyasha cause it looks like blood
[5:49:32] <%spacehouse> Despacito Scrotum
[5:49:33] <%torontototoro> despacito scrotum
[5:49:39] <asurite_warrior> give me pain in place for my guilty mind. I'd rather feel than think and accept.
[5:49:44] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Grimmchild
[5:49:46] <%moogleboy1984> how sad, Alexa, play Exposito
[5:49:49] <Mendin> BEARER OF THE CURSE, SEEK GUILT, LARGER, MORE POWERFUL GUILT
[5:49:51] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat hitting enemies at the end of the blood blade does about 5x the damage of just hitting them with the sword or a single strike of the blood blade
[5:49:57] <ahmz1404> the lore doesnt change
[5:49:58] <%Zero_Awakening> i think that description is the same as when it was just a thorn?
[5:50:03] <Morbidmort> @AngriestPat You desecrated the Sanctuary
[5:50:08] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @AngriestPat Detestatio Sanctorum is a Renunciation of family rites.
[5:50:10] <%Bluwizard21> ok guys where are these last two cherubs
[5:50:20] <%RantingRavager> ANOR JONDO
[5:50:21] <ShadeNightz> @Mendin at this point it's BECOME GUILT
[5:50:23] <%Soul_Intern> Big jondo time
[5:50:24] <deviljhojho94> more guilt
[5:50:26] <deviljhojho94> more
[5:50:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> NEW JONDO
[5:50:30] <%moogleboy1984> might baby
[5:50:36] <FranticFicus> Anor Yondo
[5:50:37] <ahmz1404> since its spanish its pronounced hondo
[5:50:40] <%hntronium> Anor Jondo
[5:50:40] <%moogleboy1984> Edmund Jondo
[5:50:41] <%WhereIsWill> new jondo ruins
[5:50:42] <+RiceeFTW> New John Doe
[5:50:43] <cureneckbeard> Anor Cumbo
[5:50:44] <asurite_warrior> ass slap
[5:50:45] <xeros720> sexy guilty
[5:50:47] <%Faustgesicht> get that guilt momentum gin
[5:50:49] <implied_consent> Burasufemusu
[5:50:50] <+Dmorktry> lol guilty souls, amirite, fellow gamers?
[5:50:58] <deviljhojho94> enjyoing the art directione a final time
[5:51:02] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat there are 3 babies in jondo, top left far right and just before the far right
[5:51:09] <LodiFrostbeard> @ahmz1404 they even pronounce it like that a couple of times in the game
[5:51:19] <asurite_warrior> So pat does this game ever feel like the term punish me daddy
[5:51:25] <%Soul_Intern> EXCUSE ME
[5:51:27] <%Soul_Intern> LUL
[5:51:34] <Mendin> @ShadeNightz Think about it. If your end goal is to Atone For Guilt, then using bitch-mode Pardoners to cleanse your guilt isn't going to help. You need to STAGGER UNDER THE WEIGHT OF YOUR SINS in order to achieve a Good and True Atonement Of Your Guilt
[5:51:34] <implied_consent> How many statues does he have to take down?
[5:51:49] <ahmz1404> i think theres a chest here he didnt get
[5:51:53] <%floralkami> taking a trip to the GOP
[5:51:56] <ahmz1404> unless it was a vine one
[5:52:00] <%WhereIsWill> jondo feels just like deepnest idk why
[5:52:13] <deviljhojho94> Guilt, atonement, hats. The true catholic experience
[5:52:14] <+Dmorktry> beyblade WutFace
[5:52:26] <ZE_Count> well I found a youtube video with all he cherubs.
[5:52:27] <asurite_warrior> So does this game ever explain the straight up monsters in the world or no?
[5:52:31] <%moogleboy1984> @WhereIsWill more like Mantis Village to me
[5:52:45] <deviljhojho94> supposedly the miracle caused the inner sins of people to manifest themselves and turn them into monsters
[5:52:48] <deviljhojho94> supossedly
[5:52:51] <Mendin> ^
[5:52:55] <Ominnous> no I remember it
[5:53:03] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat so top left?
[5:53:03] <Morbidmort> @asurite_warrior God made them from the worst interpretation of people's prayers
[5:53:06] <Mendin> There's no supposedly, the very start of th e game monologue says it
[5:53:12] <%floralkami> @whereiswill same color scheme and lack of music, replaced with echoed sound fx?
[5:53:16] <Ominnous> top left is the one he abandoned
[5:53:17] <deviljhojho94> oh hell yeah brother
[5:53:17] <ZE_Count> ***
[5:53:18] <%WhereIsWill> @moogleboy1984 ah yeah i can see that too
[5:53:32] <vonmaultke> Also i'm pretty sure these monsters are just catholic beings from the bible
[5:53:35] <asurite_warrior> ah I understand I often fight with the split man battle cross demon or the boomerang book librarian in my soul
[5:53:41] <deviljhojho94> get that baby
[5:53:50] <%WhereIsWill> @floralkami yeah gotta be the atmosphere
[5:53:53] <ahmz1404> im gonna say he got it
[5:53:54] <%Bluwizard21> a needle in a haystack
[5:53:55] <deviljhojho94> @asurite_warrior you too, huh
[5:54:04] <Vlesh> "The Baby" - Samus says
[5:54:11] <%floralkami> i see mantis village more in that place with all the incense
[5:54:20] <%WhereIsWill> save them babys pat!
[5:54:23] <+Dmorktry> Def Jam - Fight For The Baby
[5:54:25] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Remember you finished the chalice so you can actully bonfire now
[5:54:26] <%Ascethetic> isnt that a pearl jam song?
[5:54:26] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @asurite_warrior A daily ocurrance, really.
[5:54:36] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat do you have the heart of cerulean incense for you sword
[5:54:49] <LodiFrostbeard> @Mendin I think the tone of the game kind of implies that the origin of the miracle might not be all that holy, i haven't been paying too much attention to the lore tho, i'm probably wrong
[5:54:57] <ahmz1404> it was there
[5:55:05] <%Bluwizard21> ok so you got that baby
[5:55:14] <ahmz1404> you got this bebe
[5:55:19] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat i dont think there a re any babies in jondo
[5:55:28] <ZE_Count> Did he get the one behind the pillars in the Desecrated Cistern?
[5:55:32] <%Zero_Awakening> @AngriestPat you got the one from the starting area of the game?
[5:55:38] <Vlesh> I don't trust chat
[5:55:41] <%Soul_Intern> This is gonna take a while
[5:55:44] <%WhereIsWill> jondo babys SAVED
[5:55:44] <%RubberFistFight> @LodiFrostbeard yeah if you don't pay attention to a thing you kind of can't make any statements on it really, can you.
[5:55:44] <Morbidmort> @ZE_Count he got the pillar baby
[5:55:45] <FranticFicus> Anor Jondo
[5:55:50] <asurite_warrior> yeah I think Im annoying my priest, but I gotta keep that holy blessing to harm the tree demon. The yard will get out of control if I don't
[5:56:01] <Buzzard42> @RubberFistFight are you always Like This lmao
[5:56:04] <+Dmorktry> Half of chat only tells lies, the other half only tells truths
[5:56:13] <LodiFrostbeard> @RubberFistFight you're a cartoon character
[5:56:16] <%hntronium> The third half of chat does both
[5:56:16] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat in greivance ascends directly above the boss fight did u get the floating baby there? it was out of reach
[5:56:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Cumbo is a truth
[5:56:25] <pabloelenano2> @AngriestPat design 1 person to post here where the babbys are and only listen to him and we can tell if you already got it or not
[5:56:27] <asurite_warrior> I feel like a good 3rd of chat is jokes sooo
[5:56:46] <Ominnous> @AngriestPat did you get key of the scribe ever?
[5:56:47] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight lol, i guess if it aint me, it was you to slap their nuts around.
[5:56:50] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you get to that area you couldn't jump in blight town?
[5:56:53] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Look at all these fucking hats
[5:56:53] <ahmz1404> what about the baby below the snow area over the cliff?
[5:56:59] <Mendin> Wait, NO HE DIDNT
[5:57:01] <+nekodelic> let's focus on the area he's in right now
[5:57:06] <+Dmorktry> Those babies goona be grown ass adults by the end
[5:57:07] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami it's kinda hilarious how I can't even breath without somebody taking a jab.
[5:57:14] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat There's one in Graveyard of the Peaks that requires the golden thread
[5:57:15] <Silly_Duckling> naw, listen to any random shmuck that comes in here, that's where the real progress is made
[5:57:16] <asurite_warrior> This is the world your saving Pat. You're a true hero.

[5:58:01] <LodiFrostbeard> @floralkami seriusly so petty and silly over nothing, both of you
[5:58:08] <Tersalus> the only true path to salvation is *checks bible* wear a larger hat
[5:58:11] <Silly_Duckling> is the baby with a goat? is the baby on a boat?
[5:58:20] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight he called you a cartoon character, like that's a bad thing?
[5:58:20] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Jesus fuck chat, ya'll can't let something of no consequence slide?
[5:58:21] <%luftraumm1> @angriestpat what's the skin you're using?
[5:58:21] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Does every baby give a unique prize before you kill them all? We could just find out by asking about that.

[5:59:38] <T_Sasquatch> loooooooooool
[5:59:39] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami i think he thinks i'm some kind of one-dimensional mustache-twirling villain. I mean that says more about him than about me, really, doesn't it.
[5:59:40] <%Zombrocom> Wow
[5:59:40] <%Soul_Intern> And thats it
[5:59:42] <%floralkami> @lodifrostbeard it's because it's of such little consequence that it's fun to bitch about. btw, you still haven't explained what's wrong with the bosses besides you liked the art better than them.

[6:00:43] <%zamzoph> BabyRage
[6:00:44] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight you could start wearing a fake stache for your streams and not draw attention to it
[6:00:46] <%luftraumm1> I wish there were secret bosses

[6:01:07] <Mendin> I feel like he got that one instantly after getting the vines
[6:01:07] <implied_consent> Take a break if you want, pat.
[6:01:10] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat also remember that your blood blade is the strongest tool in your arsenal
[6:01:10] <Ultimatefool> This game needs a baby radar
[6:01:11] <cosmicgoatee> i mean its 2 left. does the bell work for baby too I wonder
[6:01:12] <Mendin> Cause that was one of the most memorable ones
[6:01:23] <%moogleboy1984> @ahmz1404 nah, the one behind the Mary statue? I backseated him into that one
[6:01:30] <Vlesh> The babe with the power? What power? The power of voodoo? You do?
[6:01:30] <ahmz1404> ok
[6:01:31] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami maybe when i hit 300 followers I'll do something like that. Be like "ha HA, I was Dick Dastardly all along!" or something.
[6:01:43] <%Bluwizard21> @cosmicgoatee it doesnt work for babies and it's two needles in a whole game
[6:01:48] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat did you get to that area you couldn't jump to a ledge in the cistern?
[6:01:49] <CrystalLightPeachTea> The Spell you get with all babies doesn't sound all that great. It seems tantamount to an assist trophy.
[6:01:58] <%Bluwizard21> I have a map I can see every baby and I don't knwo where his two could be
[6:02:07] <%Shadicara> pat you always need big huge power don't lie Kappa

[6:03:00] <%floralkami> *Martian
[6:03:01] <Mendin> @AngriestPat BUT REDUCES ELEMENTAL RESISTANCE
[6:03:01] <%moogleboy1984> you take increased damage for the ones you miss though

[6:03:13] <%Shadicara> don't miss Kappa

[6:03:25] <%Bluwizard21> @cosmicgoatee yeah 10 hours would be a bit much
[6:03:47] <cosmicgoatee> thats an understatement Kappa

[6:05:42] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat if you want something to fill a single stream, grab a game called GRIS. It's a beautiful game, more like art and music in motion. The music especially is outstanding.

[6:06:07] <+Jaysky> Every time I tried to play Fallout 4 I got bored 2 hours into it
[6:06:08] <+Epic_Fubar> I'm cool with that
[6:06:09] <%vectorless_peon> NO FALLOUT 4 ITS AWFUL

[6:06:20] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @AngriestPat Has all this self-torture put you in the mod for a modern fallout game?
[6:06:27] <Silly_Duckling> Install anime race mod PogChamp
[6:06:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That bearded baby hit you with his butt.
[6:06:29] <%moogleboy1984> I'd rather watch DF runs of Eden Savage tbh
[6:06:32] <Coystick> Stream Anthemlands 3
[6:06:38] <Mendin> Back to Remnant
[6:06:39] <%torontototoro> stream the underrated masstapiece, Radical Heights!
[6:06:40] <%Faustgesicht> fucking play FO3 if you're going that route
[6:06:41] <%floralkami> SCHEDULE AT RISK. NO TO FALLOUT 4
[6:06:42] <Buzzard42> no do it
[6:06:44] <%Soul_Intern> LUL
[6:06:46] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Fallout 4 is Okay. Which is really bad for a fallout game. But it's still okay.
[6:06:47] <senatorarmstrong_2020> ide watch and prolly even play it again because of it
[6:06:48] <+CharredChord> These are kinda lame arenas
[6:06:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> do it
[6:06:49] <deviljhojho94> LUL reminds me of the time you streamed rage
[6:06:50] <DeliciousPears> do it
[6:06:51] <Mendin> Or start LISA
[6:06:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> YES TO FO4
[6:06:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> I mean, I'll watch that garbage if you stream it...
[6:06:57] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat 7 guilt shrines total
[6:06:58] <deviljhojho94> I would watch literally anything tho
[6:06:58] <%Shadicara> BabyRage
[6:06:59] <%moogleboy1984> has he never done LISA?
[6:07:01] <%floralkami> DO LISA
[6:07:02] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> I'll watch that shit
[6:07:02] <%WhereIsWill> do it just to spite us crazies LUL
[6:07:02] <Coystick> I will never not be mad at Rage 2
[6:07:04] <%Soul_Intern> I would only watch 4 if it was HEAVILY modded
[6:07:07] <%vectorless_peon> stream daytona USA
[6:07:07] <%Zombrocom> Do whatever ya want dude
[6:07:10] <%MalekDracarus> Dont listen to chat, stream what you want
[6:07:10] <Tersalus> DO the fallout
[6:07:12] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat fuck the haters man, if you wanna play FO4 go right the fuck ahead. Your castle, your rules.
[6:07:14] <Silly_Duckling> Stream the modding of Fallout 4
[6:07:15] <Buzzard42> Yes
[6:07:18] <%moogleboy1984> that's a two stream game imo
[6:07:20] <deviljhojho94> its possible
[6:07:22] <Buzzard42> ...probably
[6:07:27] <ZE_Count> does the lore change on the flower?
[6:07:28] <+CommradeWolf> @AngriestPat What do you call a boat full of polite football players? A good sportsman ship.
[6:07:28] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> maybe
[6:07:30] <%riderstrike152> Stream Deadly Premonition Origins
[6:07:34] <%floralkami> how about streaming LISA?
[6:07:36] <%bevyrage> @moogleboy1984 if he doesn't go painful yeah
[6:07:38] <Tersalus> FO4 is not good but fun to watch. or, I'm wrong and bad
[6:07:50] <%Soul_Intern> Librarby
[6:07:52] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat I did these pretty early, and they ruined my playthrough as sometimes in the switch version the guilt totem would spawn on spikes
[6:07:53] <Coystick> There's not as many as you'd think
[6:07:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @CommradeWolf That's the level of dad joke I need in my life.
[6:07:58] <%moogleboy1984> he could play OFF too
[6:08:04] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Have a stream where you spend 2hrs in the create a character and intro, then never return to the game again
[6:08:08] <deviljhojho94> progression
[6:08:08] <Buzzard42> or he could do neither
[6:08:08] <%SirGO0SE> fallout 4 modder would rule but you have to finish new Vegas still please @angriestpat
[6:08:10] <Mendin> @Bluwizard21 It happened to Pat ehre once too
[6:08:13] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight no, dont put fecal matter on the castle walls, tho
[6:08:21] <ZE_Count> Play Rage 2!
[6:08:25] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @AngriestPat Tears of Atonement, Thorny Briar. Give us the lore.
[6:08:27] <%SirGO0SE> modded*
[6:08:34] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat also destroying them all will make it impossible to talk to the man in the fountain or use the blood shrines to upgrade bile flasks
[6:08:38] <%Punchasaur> stream fallout 4 but be the belligerent murderous asshole you know you want to be
[6:08:39] <Coystick> Yeah they feel like something you do when you're cleaning up the map at the very end
[6:08:42] <%hntronium> Aren't tears of atonement just the currency?
[6:08:51] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> chat gets all up in arms about FO4 but it's not a bad game. It has many flaws, but it made many genuine improvements over the previous games, even if it also fucked some things up.
[6:08:58] <Coystick> What is the deal with that other bridge back there
[6:09:05] <%floralkami> yes, lets put the COLORFUL fecal matter on the castle walls, that would be way better..
[6:09:08] <%Zero_Awakening> @hntronium yeah tears = $
[6:09:08] <AdmiralButtloaf> Please sir, can I have some lore? LORE?!
[6:09:20] <Mendin> The approach to the first plotgate of t he game, and a boss fight arena, @Coystick
[6:09:26] <%Faustgesicht> Yo what other faiths would make a good game like this?
[6:09:30] <%moogleboy1984> NOOOOOOO Skeksis!
[6:09:31] <Coystick> Yaaay
[6:09:31] <%WhereIsWill> cant get over how beautiful this game is tho
[6:09:33] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat you are basically spittin on god so I'd imagine his parishoners would be upset too
[6:09:33] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[6:09:33] <Silly_Duckling> FO4 is a better video game than New Vegas, change my mind. Kappa
[6:09:34] <Ultimatefool> ?????
[6:09:34] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[6:09:34] <Shadope342> LUL
[6:09:34] <%hntronium> pfffffffft
[6:09:35] <Mendin> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
[6:09:35] <%Zombrocom> Wow
[6:09:36] <Buzzard42> F
[6:09:40] <chronoxgp> lol
[6:09:40] <%Shadicara> LUL
[6:09:43] <Ominnous> the exact right location
[6:09:44] <+thepotatosorceress> LUL
[6:09:45] <maybefalco> LUL
[6:09:46] <deviljhojho94> you dont know
[6:09:46] <%hntronium> that was something
[6:09:48] <chronoxgp> SPLAT
[6:09:50] <%floralkami> okay, a genocide run of FO4 would be pretty entertaining to watch
[6:10:03] <%Shadicara> LEDGE MY ARCH NEMESIS
[6:10:06] <Coystick> Hey cool red sword when did that happen
[6:10:06] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami there's something to be said for streaming "bad" games just to mock them, though. I did that with Detroit recently, and I'm gonna do the entire Quantic back catalog eventually.
[6:10:10] <%SirGO0SE> chats dumb they'll whine no FO4 then cry when he doesn't complete it
[6:10:11] <deviljhojho94> im still up for a fallout 4 stream tomatoCool
[6:10:13] <Morbidmort> This game NOT reward blind faith
[6:10:13] <%moogleboy1984> I'd kill for a Relic that turns off spike instakill
[6:10:21] <%Punchasaur> Islam would make a cool game, lots of explosions
[6:10:22] <deviljhojho94> i dont want to play the game but i would watch someone do
[6:10:29] <Coystick> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
[6:10:31] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> HAHAHAHHHAHA
[6:10:32] <deviljhojho94> OH NO NO NO
[6:10:32] <jaid251> Are you gonna stream daimon x machina?
[6:10:33] <ZE_Count> Go back to Divinity: Original Sin 2 Pat!
[6:10:33] <%Zombrocom> Hm
[6:10:33] <%hntronium> your own jumps are the greatest enemy in this game
[6:10:34] <Hyphixsys> PAT GOT SO BUFFED
[6:10:38] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @floralkami Only if it skips the first 15 minutes of tedious walking cutscenes.
[6:10:39] <Shadope342> THE TRUE BOSS
[6:10:39] <etoir> rekt
[6:10:40] <%StreamStopA> Just restart the speedrun
[6:10:41] <Coystick> Spikes are the true final boss
[6:10:44] <Ultimatefool> Are spikes the physical form of CRAZY TALK
[6:10:46] <%vectorless_peon> @Silly_Duckling no need to change your mind, when it is so clearly broken to begin with
[6:10:49] <deviljhojho94> Your strenght cant overcome spikes
[6:10:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> If only there were a spawn point closer.
[6:10:50] <Silly_Duckling> seriously, though, while the narrative is troubled in 4, it's gunplay is way better
[6:10:54] <AdmiralButtloaf> this game looks like it needs a jump dash
[6:10:57] <CrystalLightPeachTea> Wait, can I... Do this?
[6:10:57] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight wai.... as in the Cage purgatory?
[6:10:58] <Paperware> super jesus
[6:10:58] <%nmaten> become jesus
[6:11:00] <deviljhojho94> Guiltasaurus
[6:11:00] <CrystalLightPeachTea> No
[6:11:01] <%hntronium> become devil
[6:11:04] <ZE_Count> Conehead Jesus Pat!
[6:11:06] <doggieo> tall
[6:11:06] <+CharredChord> gold tree? is that right?
[6:11:07] <%marsano168> Mega Jesus
[6:11:07] <Hyphixsys> "GULT ABSORBED"
[6:11:11] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami yup. I got no soul, so he can't absorb it.
[6:11:15] <%Shadicara> Imagine if someone just surrounded pat's house with spiked floors
[6:11:15] <%StreamStopA> Get gud?
[6:11:16] <%hntronium> become angle
[6:11:16] <Coystick> I imagine Game Kitchen has stats on where players died and it's 70% spikes
[6:11:19] <Mendin> Good Question
[6:11:20] <chronoxgp> ye are not guilty BIG O
[6:11:20] <deviljhojho94> you know its kind of ambiguous
[6:11:23] <%WhereIsWill> become as SIN
[6:11:27] <CrowbarFacelift> Become a sin-eater like Heath Ledger
[6:11:34] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> a little from column A, a little from column B
[6:11:45] <%sl8r4l8r> JUST GET DOWN WITH THE DEVIL. THE KIDS WILL LOVE IT
[6:11:48] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight Don't let Omikron implode that empty shell
[6:11:48] <%luftraumm1> @crowbarfacelift basically
[6:11:49] <zenobygoat> i think the whole point of the narrative is to sustain suffering
[6:12:00] <Coystick> It feels like the spikes are MAGNETIZED
[6:12:01] <deviljhojho94> the penitent one wasnt penitent enough and got consumed
[6:12:06] <deviljhojho94> ash vored, even
[6:12:07] <%Shadicara> I'd laugh if you climbed up the dirt hill only to fall off into a spike pit LUL
[6:12:09] <+CharredChord> maybe you become the old lady shop keep and sell you wares for the rest of your days
[6:12:12] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> You use the stones to destroy the stones
[6:12:15] <%floralkami> @rubberfistfight like he did Liam...
[6:12:15] <%Punchasaur> being the grievous miracle really makes you feeeel like batman
[6:12:32] <%NeroInfinite> why'd pat change from gold and white?
[6:12:42] <Mendin> New skin for the Bad Ending
[6:12:45] <pabloelenano2> @Punchasaur you mean horphan?
[6:12:45] <Hyphixsys> Bookmerang Kappa
[6:12:46] <%NeroInfinite> ah
[6:12:46] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat with your power it might be better to take it a bit slower and just destroy the obstacles in your way for a faster result
[6:12:48] <%CopperTucker> grievous injury, palpable fear
[6:12:48] <%floralkami> that works too fucking well, Punch
[6:12:54] <%Laecerelius> Pat wanted to be Red Cop
[6:12:55] <%vectorless_peon> good old book damage
[6:12:57] <%SirGO0SE> @punchasaur LUL
[6:13:05] <Reook1> nice trade
[6:13:11] <Hyphixsys> "read a book"
[6:13:15] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @CopperTucker Grievous Miracle, Papal Fear
[6:13:15] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> LUL
[6:13:18] <%RubberFistFight> @floralkami nah i'll be fine. I reckon I'll have a good time with fucken Indigo Prophecy though. That shit looks dumb as bricks.
[6:13:19] <%Maids4lyfe> yes
[6:13:20] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat your stream tonight helped me find the last few things I needed to get 100%
[6:13:21] <Morbidmort> Time stopped
[6:13:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> lol yeah
[6:13:23] <%Soul_Intern> Good game
[6:13:23] <%Dakuu75> uhhhh
[6:13:23] <%NeroInfinite> yeo
[6:13:25] <%StreamStopA> no
[6:13:26] <%Cigwynn> Pat stop breaking the game
[6:13:34] <Mendin> Too many after-residues of the animation stuck on each other anad it went all fucky
[6:13:34] <%floralkami> yeah, take that book to the face, that's how you learn
[6:13:43] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat its another glitch sometimes the flasks dont heal
[6:13:44] <%floralkami> I KNEW I WASN'T CRAZY
[6:13:53] <%StreamStopA> ez boss
[6:13:58] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> It's not a bug its a feature
[6:14:34] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat I think the flask wont heal based on frameloss during mutliple heals
[6:14:43] <Hyphixsys> whips bois
[6:15:04] <%luftraumm1> after you see them a million times you start to forget but the animations in this game are incredible
[6:15:13] <Mendin> Have you ever done the Big Groundslam since you got that upgrade, Pat?
[6:15:22] <%floralkami> @bluwizard21 i think it has something to do with his max life and vials percentage not scaling together. there are items to buff the vial restore percentage.
[6:15:44] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Very nice
[6:15:48] <MKUltima> Despacito Scrotum
[6:15:50] <%Dakuu75> what's that mean? translation?
[6:15:52] <+CharredChord> Despacito Santorum
[6:15:56] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[6:16:01] <deviljhojho94> Very cool
[6:16:05] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat a very good rosary for spamming the blood blade
[6:16:08] <CrystalLightPeachTea> @Dakuu75 Renunciation of family rites.
[6:16:11] <Mendin> Detestatio Sacrorum means something like a rejection of the rituals
[6:16:22] <%Dakuu75> neat <3
[6:16:25] <%StreamStopA> Does Elmo like vodka?
[6:16:28] <%floralkami> THAT WASN'T JT
[6:16:37] <Silly_Duckling> more spells sounds good
[6:16:40] <deviljhojho94> A couple of patches and its pretty much great
[6:16:40] <%WhereIsWill> and its on the switch too!
[6:16:42] <Coystick> I want a NG+
[6:16:49] <+Surf_Zombie> The music of this area slaps
[6:16:50] <%zamzoph> I'd recommend this to anybody*
[6:16:51] <+Kduff89> @AngriestPat I saw a clip of you on a facebook twitch ad. It was the astral chain ice cream one
[6:16:55] <+Ell1ot> the baby?
[6:16:56] <Mendin> There we go
[6:16:59] <gonzy92> I bought this over slave cops
[6:17:00] <%luftraumm1> I want more bosses
[6:17:00] <AdmiralButtloaf> lol what if they have catholic parents
[6:17:01] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @StreamStopA I mean, who doesn't?
[6:17:04] <Coystick> Penitent One for Smash
[6:17:07] <Hyphixsys> there's a NG+ on this? @Coystick if it does, imma buy it
[6:17:08] <Reook1> Google says Detestatio Sacrorum means "Sacred Oath"
[6:17:13] <+CharredChord> I'm gonna wait for a sale for sure
[6:17:14] <%Punchasaur> recommend it to your grandma? @angriestpat
[6:17:18] <%RubberFistFight> @Kduff89 yeah that was pretty awesome. max was on it too. He was also on one for RDR2 back when that came out.
[6:17:18] <Hyphixsys> I love games with NG+
[6:17:22] <Mendin> @AngriestPat So you agree that this game is 1-2 patches from upgrading Good to Great?
[6:17:32] <%Soul_Intern> Aw
[6:17:33] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> F
[6:17:33] <%TheBitingIrish> doodSad
[6:17:33] <%hntronium> recommend this to paige?
[6:17:34] <+Ell1ot> me neither
[6:17:34] <Coystick> @Hyphixsys I don't think so, but I suspect they'll add it
[6:17:35] <%Soul_Intern> :(
[6:17:35] <%nmaten> oof
[6:17:36] <%Dakuu75> @Coystick yeah, and jsut smears a glass jar of blood on his face
[6:17:37] <Mendin> Paige has grandma mode sometimes
[6:17:39] <Hyphixsys> BibleThump
[6:17:48] <%Punchasaur> @angriestpat me neither pal
[6:17:50] <deviljhojho94> Grandma paige is so bizarre
[6:17:52] <%Soul_Intern> You have Paige, she can count as a grandma sometimes
[6:17:53] <%floralkami> oh, sorry for your loss..
[6:17:58] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> Pat just Crazy talked his grandmas out of existence
[6:17:59] <+Ell1ot> yes. Paige is grandma
[6:17:59] <cureneckbeard> F
[6:18:11] <%Frostydough1> Jesus fucking christ Pat is STILL streaming Blasphemous even after I get home from the gym??? It's that good huh
[6:18:13] <+Kduff89> @RubberFistFight I havent watched the stream cause I am playing it myself but it was way cool to see him and max on there.
[6:18:19] <Mendin> He loves it
[6:18:27] <%Frostydough1> glad he's finding games enjoyable :D
[6:18:31] <Hyphixsys> @Frostydough1 he needs to absord all those GUILT
[6:18:34] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat the max buff makes you feel like a god, but it's really just you knowing the enemies and getting to hit them fewer times
[6:18:34] <%WhereIsWill> thats how you know its good
[6:18:37] <Shadope342> oh he's gettin there
[6:18:45] <%luftraumm1> it's great when pat gets hooked on a game
[6:18:56] <Coystick> Oh lawd he's gettin'
[6:19:04] <+chaos5338> would woi
[6:19:08] <%Frostydough1> @Hyphixsys need all those delicous delicous sins
[6:19:12] <Mendin> I feed my Guilt it grows powerful
[6:19:13] <%WhereIsWill> BONK CITY
[6:19:22] <+prism_zet> bonk bonk bonk
[6:19:25] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat inuyasha that shit
[6:19:25] <%RubberFistFight> fuck Chairpope pissed me off when i first started this game.
[6:19:26] <%floralkami> i can't wait for the stream to end so i can go sin in bed before sleep.
[6:19:27] <%Punchasaur> new bonk city
[6:19:29] <+chaos5338> would Woolie play this game or is the Christian themes and imagery too much for him?
[6:19:31] <deviljhojho94> Feed me guilt
[6:19:32] <%NeroInfinite> giga bonk city
[6:19:33] <ZE_Count> *smack Conrhead hat* This pointy hat boy can fit sooo much guilt!
[6:19:34] <Hyphixsys> @Frostydough1 delish Kappa
[6:19:37] <%Frostydough1> bonk
[6:19:41] <Coystick> I used the invulnerability prayer to great affect against the final boss, allowed for big fat safe heals.
[6:19:44] <MistahMrMatt> how much longer the stream got?
[6:19:56] <%RubberFistFight> @MistahMrMatt yes.
[6:19:59] <%luftraumm1> iirc woolie had Adventist parents
[6:20:00] <deviljhojho94> Saltine guilt and balls make a potent combination
[6:20:03] <Mendin> He has... two more statues and then Final Boss Redux so <30min?
[6:20:04] <%Soul_Intern> @MistahMrMatt 20, maybe 30 minutes?
[6:20:07] <%WhereIsWill> just stab em with everything why dont ya
[6:20:19] <ZE_Count> Honestly all this game needs is a crazy cool optional boss.
[6:20:22] <Coystick> I like the red sword what skin is that
[6:20:23] <MKUltima> I've got it, it means Detachable Scrotum
[6:20:25] <deviljhojho94> oh man adventists are something else. And i say that as someone that grew in heavy catholic tradition
[6:20:28] <MistahMrMatt> fair enough lol i wanna see this beat ill sleep later
[6:20:29] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat blades of blood, inuyasha callbacks all over
[6:20:39] <deviljhojho94> Adventists are wacky
[6:20:53] <%Cigwynn> BONK
[6:20:55] <+prism_zet> bonk
[6:20:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Coystick You have to beat the game and get the bad ending to unlcok this skin.
[6:20:55] <+CharredChord> dong
[6:20:59] <%hntronium> my bleeding blade
[6:21:01] <Mendin> Oh right remember when Woolie saw the intro to Binding of Isaac and he had to process it for a minute
[6:21:02] <%Soul_Intern> @deviljhojho94 Tell me about it, I live in a country full of 'em
[6:21:10] <Coystick> @King_Wolf_Rigger ah phooey
[6:21:11] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat if an enemy has a shield you can throw the blood blade though them if you are close enough and it will hit them on the return
[6:21:23] <%Soul_Intern> @Mendin Gib link right now
[6:21:24] <deviljhojho94> @Soul_Intern my condolences
[6:21:30] <+nekodelic> @Soul_Intern I feel you bro

[6:21:38] <Coystick> Super Bible Aesthetic
[6:21:39] <%WhereIsWill> dripping with atmosphere from the art alone
[6:21:50] <Shadope342> LUL
[6:21:50] <Coystick> Raw Testament Aesthetic
[6:21:50] <%NeroInfinite> Did he do the inverse cup thing or was that sidequest too much of a ballache to bother with?
[6:21:50] <+prism_zet> hahahaha
[6:21:52] <ShadeTheNovice> LUL
[6:21:52] <Hyphixsys> WAT
[6:21:55] <cureneckbeard> perkele
[6:21:55] <%Bluwizard21> hit it with a blood blade
[6:21:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> hahahaha get shit on
[6:22:03] <Shadope342> awww it didn't respawn the other one
[6:22:04] <Mendin> @Soul_Intern Just youtube BEst Friends Binding of Isaac
[6:22:04] <%luftraumm1> the animations, details and art direction are super
[6:22:14] <%Soul_Intern> @deviljhojho94 @nekodelic Thanks you too, my sanity feels better
[6:22:17] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat if you can't tell i was obsessed with the blood blade and the charged shot
[6:22:20] <Mendin> Like a NG+
[6:22:23] <deviljhojho94> new game plus would be ideal in a patch,,,
[6:22:27] <Shadope342> potential future dlc?
[6:22:29] <%StaceMcGate> "I'm too strong, I can't be killed!"
[6:22:32] <%moogleboy1984> the skill tree feels tacked on honestly
[6:22:33] <Coystick> Expansion Pack pls
[6:22:37] <%Soul_Intern> @Mendin Thanks bruv
[6:22:39] <+Kduff89> or like an upside down world like Castlevania
[6:22:44] <ZE_Count> Something like Optional Super Boss! Or a super hard dungeon.
[6:22:49] <Hyphixsys> DLC : Jesus' Revenge
[6:22:55] <T_Sasquatch> I'm still waiting for eitr
[6:23:01] <Mendin> The skill tree is very basic, which is fine. You have these 4 moves, now make them better
[6:23:04] <%gespenst25> mea culpa -designer probably
[6:23:07] <%Bluwizard21> @moogleboy1984 it's not tacked on it was there to keep you from using obscene skills early
[6:23:08] <laguerrilha> DLC will have thumbs-up Jesus
[6:23:10] <%Soul_Intern> Yeah thats beautiful
[6:23:11] <Hyphixsys> AMAZING ARTWORK Kreygasm
[6:23:12] <%WhereIsWill> they are FUKED is where they are
[6:23:16] <%Soul_Intern> And yeah, it probably is
[6:23:16] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> God that's such a good lookin' shot
[6:23:17] <%NeroInfinite> yeah
[6:23:17] <Mendin> I think the Tree is the gateway to the Mother of Mothers
[6:23:23] <%Punchasaur> new testament was just dlc and patch notes for the Bible
[6:23:33] <%Cigwynn> DLC better have super ripped Korean Jesus
[6:23:37] <deviljhojho94> This game better win some awards i tell you what
[6:23:40] <+arfsm95> @AngriestPat is there a downside to destroying statues besides no guilt cure?
[6:23:43] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur You are the king of comedy in this chat
[6:23:46] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat dlc has tomoe from sekiro
[6:23:46] <%moogleboy1984> the fourth hit and down spin combos feel unimpactful, since the only enemies you can actually hit them with will poise through the hits and knock you out of the combo
[6:23:50] <prideofacadia> Comment ca va Patrick!
[6:23:53] <%ElenaManetta> hey pat's still going
[6:23:53] <Hyphixsys> @Cigwynn we all need that Korean Jesus Kappa
[6:23:58] <Coystick> They so break visual continuity, the tree is at the end of the bridge where you fight the dude and the angel.
[6:24:00] <%WhereIsWill> game awards gonna be lit...maybe
[6:24:00] <%moogleboy1984> the down smash upgrades require a higher elevation than your normal jump
[6:24:13] <%moogleboy1984> blooderang is amazing though
[6:24:13] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pepis
[6:24:13] <%Dakuu75> !Roulette
[6:24:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> People didn't like the Jesus update, so they wiped their hard drive.
[6:24:28] <%ElenaManetta> wOW PAT's BARS gOT BIG SINCE i LAST TUNED IN
[6:24:34] <%Bluwizard21> @arfsm95 locks off npcs, prevents gaining new bile flasks and if your guilt totem shows up on spikes your just fucked
[6:24:36] <Mendin> The Biggest
[6:24:38] <%Punchasaur> @soul_intern I can't tell if that was genuine or sarcastic lol
[6:24:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> Holy shit you crazy motherfuckers are still going!! Hi chat. apatBig neohWhat apatDab
[6:24:42] <deviljhojho94> REEEEEE-

[6:24:55] <CrystalLightPeachTea> RAT
[6:24:55] <%floralkami> fuck, I'm starting to lose it.... chat, hello me stay awake
[6:25:00] <+arfsm95> @Bluwizard21 i see, thanks mate
[6:25:01] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur Genuine, sorryIm tired LUL
[6:25:01] <deviljhojho94> No stopping until the game is over man
[6:25:12] <deviljhojho94> no one leaves until its done
[6:25:13] <Coystick> So basically do the Guilt Challenges at the end
[6:25:15] <Buzzard42> big stumbo
[6:25:20] <%torontototoro> Paaaaat beat the game so we can sleep. You can do it!
[6:25:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger Feeling better. Not sure what kicked my ass earlier but I passed out immediately. Nap helped.
[6:25:35] <Mendin> It's the topleftmost door in t hat room
[6:25:36] <%Bluwizard21> @moogleboy1984 yeah the downsmash thing isnt that great, but the dodge to attack the charge attack and most definitely the blood blade are insane upgrades
[6:25:40] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur Also cant blame you, there are some hostile people in this chat
[6:25:43] <%Punchasaur> @soul_intern oh thanks! no problem, glad somebody thinks I'm funny lol
[6:25:43] <+chaos5338> this music
[6:25:47] <%moogleboy1984> oh yeah, the Stinger is god tier
[6:25:50] <%FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger Anything fun / exciting that I should know about?
[6:26:05] <%moogleboy1984> I didn't care for the charge attack tbh
[6:26:08] <%Punchasaur> @soul_intern for REAL
[6:26:12] <Mendin> Yeah this game has one of the better Stingers
[6:26:19] <Mendin> the move, that is
[6:26:21] <deviljhojho94> tomatoCool so close to the ending i can almost taste the guilt
[6:26:23] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Well, that's weird, but also good to hear you're kickina round again lol. Pat beat the game, so he's mopping stuff up to get the good ending, and chat was chanting CUMBO for awhile.
[6:26:28] <%Bluwizard21> @moogleboy1984 if you land the blood blade to detonate right on an enemy it does 5X the damage of your 7x upgraded sword
[6:26:43] <deviljhojho94> Guilt tastes like communion wafers, oddly enough
[6:26:45] <%FirearmsInstructor> y Pat sword red? .-.
[6:26:53] <ahmz1404> i cant wait for NG+ and NIGHTMARE mode
[6:26:58] <%Bluwizard21> @moogleboy1984 I 4 shot the enemy sword girl and 2 shot the first pope form
[6:27:04] <ZE_Count> He a big chonk of guilt
[6:27:04] <cureneckbeard> big cumbo sword
[6:27:05] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Red sword is from beating the game
[6:27:07] <%Soul_Intern> @Punchasaur You are really creative with your jokes, Im sure many people find you funy
[6:27:11] <%floralkami> @firearmsinstructor oh, welcome back
[6:27:18] <+CharredChord> a wandering fart

[6:27:34] <OlmStranger> So we're Pardoner Fennel now?
[6:27:37] <%Soul_Intern> BIG BOIS
[6:27:38] <jell_ree> sup guys...wow is he trying to achieve 100%?
[6:27:38] <+CouchViolator> This guy is tearing this game up....is this a new game plus or something? The person I watched play this looked like they were struggling way harder
[6:27:39] <%FirearmsInstructor> @floralkami Thanks. Felt horrible earlier, now doing better. :)
[6:27:40] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat landing that blood blade right where it detonates deals 5x the damge of your swords damage
[6:27:41] <%AncelDeLambert> oh, Pat's starting to flag
[6:27:47] <Hyphixsys> rock gals
[6:27:48] <%Soul_Intern> BONK
[6:27:49] <%FirearmsInstructor> @hntronium womp womp ;(
[6:27:50] <%AncelDeLambert> Stumbo needs a minute
[6:27:53] <deviljhojho94> Nah man pat has all the upgardes
[6:27:54] <Mendin> He's going to achieve Good Ending but he's respectably close to 100% as well
[6:28:02] <Slim_Lipid> 🕑 👈 😠 TIME TO SLEEP 😠 👉 🕑
[6:28:02] <deviljhojho94> This game was not made to be hard I think

[6:28:28] <%FirearmsInstructor> Red sword stronger? Or is it purely cosmetic? Can he switch back to purple or whatever?
[6:28:30] <+CharredChord> lazer his ass
[6:28:32] <%Bluwizard21> I've jumped over that shit
[6:28:33] <%Punchasaur> @soul_intern thanks! I appreciate that a lot

[6:28:38] <%Zombrocom> This dude is the bane of pats existence
[6:28:39] <%floralkami> @punchasaur literally every joke you've said i hearted how right they were
[6:28:41] <%hntronium> through the power of spin
[6:28:41] <deviljhojho94> LUL

[6:29:09] <%Dakuu75> am I insane or is his health not going up sometimes on flask-use?
[6:29:10] <Mendin> Good Ending will also give a skin
[6:29:13] <+greenmoose11915> a token to join the drgon bros
[6:29:14] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Elmo's
[6:29:16] <%floralkami> hated. like my autocorrect @punchasaur
[6:29:17] <%Bluwizard21> on to the last one
[6:29:23] <%AncelDeLambert> if it wasn't so late in the day and this stream were running long, I'd tell Pat to take a donation break, cuz he needs it
[6:29:24] <deviljhojho94> covetous snake
[6:29:27] <%Punchasaur> @floralkami haha I tend to lean toward the sad but true
[6:29:27] <%Soul_Intern> THE NUMBER OF MEOWS
[6:29:30] <Ominnous> awhhh
[6:29:32] <+CharredChord> LUL
[6:29:34] <cureneckbeard> elmo's belly is softer but pat's is hairier
[6:29:34] <Ominnous> dark souls reference
[6:29:35] <Mendin> Big Farming that reaaaaallly isnt needed
[6:29:36] <%moogleboy1984> literally worthless
[6:29:40] <cosmicgoatee> plague of gripes currency
[6:29:43] <%boondoggle42> Was that the Havel?
[6:29:48] <Coystick> Look at this Paige
[6:29:51] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Creepy Sex Coins
[6:29:51] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat basically if you have anything unupgraded or not bought this is the answer
[6:29:58] <deviljhojho94> how odd, that text had no reference....
[6:30:01] <Hyphixsys> @Sir_Gawain_Lotsson Kappa
[6:30:04] <shevan123> i wonder what that reference was
[6:30:08] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat brotherhood and finish
[6:30:14] <Silly_Duckling> I mean, snakes and avarice have been a thing before, right?
[6:30:14] <%floralkami> @punchasaur don't stop
[6:30:18] <Coystick> That coin is Anor Londo
[6:30:21] <Ominnous> well at least you can always have a full fervor bar
[6:30:23] <+RiceeFTW> "we must leave this place" must be Sen's Fortress LUL
[6:30:24] <%Soul_Intern> Very close now Pat
[6:30:25] <%TheBitingIrish> Monkeys dressed as bishops? Is that a Sekiro reference? LUL
[6:30:26] <Mendin> A horse reading scriptures makes me think Crusader Kings 2
[6:30:31] <+AntithesisEK> snakes and dragons have a long association with greed yes
[6:30:31] <Hyphixsys> @Coystick EVERYTHING is Anor Londo
[6:30:33] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat go through cell door
[6:30:34] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Dig up.
[6:30:37] <shevan123> snakes have been a symbol of the prideful and betrayal usually
[6:30:41] <%moogleboy1984> through the Sundown Gate
[6:30:51] <deviljhojho94> we are almost there
[6:30:52] <Coystick> Hang in there baby
[6:30:53] <%Bluwizard21> @moogleboy1984 sundowner?

[6:30:59] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> sleepy pat
[6:31:04] <%Dakuu75> still haven't seen the virgil from the comic?
[6:31:05] <Shadope342> sun is long down
[6:31:08] <BakerBrute> Last baby is in the bottom right corner
[6:31:11] <%Soul_Intern> But one more statue
[6:31:11] <deviljhojho94> sunupping
[6:31:12] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Sun is GONE
[6:31:12] <BakerBrute> bottom left*
[6:31:13] <%moogleboy1984> and you had an early day
[6:31:14] <+chaos5338> it's late on all coasts.
[6:31:15] <%Soul_Intern> And the boss
[6:31:17] <tigerfang86> the sun was bound to go down
[6:31:17] <Mendin> @Dakuu75 She was the penultimate boss
[6:31:21] <Coystick> I stayed up to finish this too we suffer together
[6:31:24] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Congrats on beating the game? I had to pass out earlier, but just woke up and am back. Good job.
[6:31:26] <%firehawk_420> Go to sleep Pat!
[6:31:30] <%Punchasaur> you'd think a guy who wears a spike on his head would be immune to spike damage
[6:31:30] <%ElenaManetta> i've been sleeping since 8pm! so now you gotta make up for my lack of tired, pat.
[6:31:33] <%Sovspot> go to bed
[6:31:34] <+nekodelic> there is a gap in your map
[6:31:34] <%Dakuu75> damn
[6:31:36] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat you have two more fights. the brotherhood shrine and the final boss redux
[6:31:42] <ahmz1404> ive been up for 26 hours
[6:31:44] <%luftraumm1> I think tube reference for the animals in the coin lore ate some prints by goya, Spanish artist depicted a lot of medieval stuff
[6:31:49] <cureneckbeard> pat go bed
[6:31:49] <+Flambage> @AngriestPat Might as well just make this a 24 hour stream while you're at it
[6:31:52] <laguerrilha> drink a refreshing Redbull!
[6:31:52] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> pat beat her with shadow clone ninjutsu
[6:31:55] <cosmicgoatee> wow pat I expected you to find those elusive babies
[6:31:56] <%Punchasaur> is there a patron saint of spikes?
[6:31:56] <Ace_Kuper> So is Pat going for 100% or just full ending?
[6:32:04] <sarg1010> Pat going all monkaS when spikes are on screen
[6:32:13] <%Zombrocom> That was a close call
[6:32:15] <%moogleboy1984> rightfully so
[6:32:17] <Ominnous> we're coming up on Sun Upper
[6:32:17] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> monkaGun
[6:32:18] <%luftraumm1> jesus did have a crown of thorns
[6:32:19] <Coystick> My left nut for a double jump
[6:32:26] <Ace_Kuper> Spikes are the worst in this game, cause some jumps are too precise.
[6:32:27] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat brotherhood shrine then final boss and your done
[6:32:31] <%hntronium> @Ace_Kuper Just full end if he cant find those babies
[6:32:32] <%AncelDeLambert> when floor spikes are the scariest shit in existence
[6:32:34] <Mendin> Double Jump is for people who ARENT HUGE SINNERS
[6:32:34] <%RubberFistFight> @sarg1010 to be fair they've killed him more times than everything else in this game combined.
[6:32:38] <%AncelDeLambert> oh FUCK THIS
[6:32:41] <%luftraumm1> right?
[6:32:44] <%Soul_Intern> DOUBLE JUMP ARE FOR SINNERS
[6:32:46] <tigerfang86> you're too HEAVY WITH SIN to jump in midair Pat
[6:32:46] <Mendin> YOU ARE TOO WEIGHED DOWN BY YOUR GUILT FOR A DOUBLE JUMP
[6:32:51] <%FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Catholics believe in gravity, heathen.
[6:32:53] <%floralkami> @punchasaur you'd think the patron saint of spikes would be more careful around them.
[6:32:55] <+Carpe_Deez_Nuts> games not a real Metroidvania
[6:32:56] <%SirGO0SE> ive never had double jump
[6:32:58] <ShadeTheNovice> Double jumping is sinning against the laws of physics
[6:32:59] <doggieo> Religious things do not double jump
[6:33:04] <Ace_Kuper> @hntronium Thanks, there is a baby map, but depending on how much is left it would take a while.
[6:33:05] <%Zombrocom> A metroidvania without a double jump? That has to be a sin or something
[6:33:06] <Coystick> Like he could grow angel wings for a moment or a cherub could pick him up for sec goddamn
[6:33:11] <%luftraumm1> it's kinda awesome they never give you a double jump
[6:33:13] <%nmaten> is that DIO's coffin?
[6:33:13] <cureneckbeard> Wait, Pat missed the double jump?
[6:33:14] <sarg1010> You would need wings for a double jump, and you are NO ANGEL
[6:33:16] <%hntronium> @Ace_Kuper 2 left
[6:33:19] <%Punchasaur> feel the sans crawling up your back
[6:33:20] <+RiceeFTW> there is no double jump for Catholics, only wings of an angel
[6:33:23] <%AncelDeLambert> anyone have any fingernails left?
[6:33:25] <%FirearmsInstructor> @ShadeTheNovice This guy gets it.
[6:33:30] <deviljhojho94> dont worry about it
[6:33:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @AngriestPat you can't double jump if you're weighed down by all that CATHOLIC GUILT
[6:33:38] <Ace_Kuper> @hntronium Oh, when it can be done with a map cheat.
[6:33:44] <%luftraumm1> at least it tries something different
[6:33:44] <%moogleboy1984> @Coystick it'd be more like he shoots a high pressure spurt of blood out of his feet stigmata
[6:33:48] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat ima say this now cause I need to go to bed as well, are you ready for the sequel?
[6:33:49] <deviljhojho94> no no, we need EVEN MORE GUILT
[6:33:55] <deviljhojho94> MORE GUILT
[6:33:56] <%FirearmsInstructor> xD
[6:33:58] <Hyphixsys> LUL
[6:34:02] <tigerfang86> GIVE ME MORE GUILT
[6:34:06] <Hyphixsys> MORE GUILT IS REQUIRED
[6:34:07] <%luftraumm1> video games and double jumps are almost synonymous
[6:34:11] <MKUltima> So much sin the earth itself is repulsed by your presence thus pushing you higher into the air
[6:34:12] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> USE THE GUILT AS BALLAST
[6:34:12] <Coystick> @moogleboy1984 metal
[6:34:20] <Mendin> Crisantia DLC
[6:34:20] <Ace_Kuper> DLC is planned?
[6:34:22] <%Bluwizard21> @AngriestPat dlc sequel you will see
[6:34:23] <Mendin> here's Hoping
[6:34:24] <%hntronium> you gotta make the next podcast title something religioous related
[6:34:29] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> You are weighed down by your sins
[6:34:29] <sarg1010> So what was the initial plot to this game? Why are we who we are?
