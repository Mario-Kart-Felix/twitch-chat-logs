[0:10:07] <%kraken_lab> I'm redy to be upset
[0:10:07] <%Mr_Pylon> Crono Trigger lost in the FIRST ROUND lol
[0:10:09] <PirateMike_> Hello.
[0:10:09] <%RealThiele> IGN polled idiots and GoW is now the best game ever
[0:10:09] <+orochiblood> GoW 2018 isn't even the best GoW game. that would be GOW 3
[0:10:20] <%baka_sugoi> S EE D
[0:10:24] <JojoPiero> Starring Pat Boivin as Thor
[0:10:26] <$ringabal> OH goody
[0:10:30] <Abyssal_Jaguar> GOW Top Seed based on dolla dolla donations
[0:10:31] <%RealThiele> its about gundams
[0:10:33] <+nivlac_555> oh god
[0:10:48] <%Mr_Pylon> outrage generator dot html
[0:10:50] <tanarath> GoW 4 isn't bad. it's not disco or outer wilds
[0:10:51] <comicalmond> it's all call of duty
[0:10:51] <%baka_sugoi> Stacked Brackets
[0:10:55] <%TheWinged7> gonna make the blind guess no disco elysium
[0:10:55] <+BIumen> we need to get the gamefaqs users who vote on OoT every year to help
[0:10:55] <AthenaAegis> You can't spell ignorant without IGN Kappa
[0:10:56] <atgithursdays> duh any game made before 2010 sucks
[0:10:57] <SaltyAzteca> I never forgave IGN for what they did to my boy Gene melsorrrYandere
[0:11:03] <%Ne1son> Why is anybody giving this bracket thing the time of day?????
[0:11:04] <%SpoonheadInExile> Like Last of Us 2?
[0:11:10] <%Monkeyweed21> hey Naughty Dog and Rockstar
[0:11:15] <%baka_sugoi> Really?
[0:11:15] <+nivlac_555> lol
[0:11:17] <%jtdobyns> IS TLOU2 on there?
[0:11:21] <comicalmond> to much water
[0:11:21] <%cvp5127> hmmmm
[0:11:28] <tanarath> hmmmm
[0:11:29] <+pre10cious_1> I see no problem lol
[0:11:29] <%logoth_> lmao
[0:11:29] <%Treuan> HMMM
[0:11:30] <@TheYellowcouch> At least it's not detroit become human
[0:11:30] <%JoshManVGH> How does Dishonored lose to Modern Warfare 4
[0:11:30] <TheFramedWarlock> These are the people who gave God Hand a 3.0 and Prey 2017 a 4.0 why are we even listening to them anymore ?
[0:11:31] <%Dova573> Gotta get the Killers to take each other out
[0:11:31] <@tizz86> I didn't know IGN has been relevant since 2006 lol
[0:11:34] <%ScreamLord> It's hilarious how butt hurt people were about Thor being fat. None of them apparently have seen Strong Man competitors and we get 0 description of Thor in the mythology other than Red Hair, Bearded, and Strong.
[0:11:34] <+fetrigon> wtf
[0:11:34] <+NopeBadguy> hmmmmm
[0:11:38] <marvel877> Look, I like Dad of Boy as much as the next person, BUT CMON!

[0:11:43] <+nivlac_555> hah
[0:11:45] <DianaTheAscian> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[0:11:45] <%RealThiele> just delete those new games early
[0:11:48] <theanora1> Metroid Prime and not Super Metroid?
[0:11:49] <$ringabal> Nihilistic Reminder: Popularity polls are inherently pointless
[0:11:51] <SlangPunk> @monkeyweed21 I’ll come in with a hot take, Rockstar games have always sucked balls
[0:11:53] <@TheYellowcouch> Astroturfed God of war
[0:11:54] <tanarath> Just a coincidence
[0:11:54] <+orochiblood> these polls are just triple A jerking off
[0:11:54] <%twistedj3ster> where Omikron
[0:11:55] <@ssjklyco> All japanese games stay in the corner
[0:11:56] <Slimeking_Mike> Hmmmmmmmmmm
[0:11:58] <+NopeBadguy> it must be nice to be bribed @PatStaresAt
[0:12:00] <cheapdoc> GTA 4 was mid
[0:12:01] <%Treuan> bribes
[0:12:03] <%jtdobyns> GTAV is like a dead horse they just keep beating
[0:12:04] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Games so good they got to release them 15 times
[0:12:05] <@tizz86> money
[0:12:05] <%RealThiele> Rockstar presents: $$$$ to IGN
[0:12:09] <SaltyAzteca> COINCIDENCE
[0:12:09] <%PocketBearIllustrator> it's a good thing I don't pay attention to these sort of things.
[0:12:13] <$ringabal> NO PAST, ONLY NOW
[0:12:14] <%ScreamLord> LUL
[0:12:14] <shevan123> oh fuckin boy
[0:12:15] <%SpoonheadInExile> Really activates those almonds
[0:12:16] <%baka_sugoi> Did someone use challonge to seed the bracket? LUL
[0:12:17] <Mr_Rakjo> LUL
[0:12:17] <cheapdoc> Fable 2 was terrrrible
[0:12:18] <+NopeBadguy> it must be very nice to be bribed
[0:12:19] <atgithursdays> Old games suck because they look bad
[0:12:21] <+sewermonk> why is Inside on this list?
[0:12:22] <+MrBotchamania> RDR deserves it.
[0:12:23] <comicalmond> halo 2?
[0:12:24] <Virokwet> LUL oh cmon fable 2 was dope
[0:12:25] <%SpoonheadInExile> Really gets the old noggin joggin'
[0:12:27] <AthenaAegis> Fable?!?! Dear god WutFace
[0:12:27] <%logoth_> Did they put YIIK on there too
[0:12:27] <%GalacticaPhanto> Clearly the best Rockstar game is The Warriors and it's the truth
[0:12:28] <%JoshManVGH> BLOODBORNE LOST TO BREATH OF THE WILD!?
[0:12:31] <+mckraven> how is half the GTA games somehow best of all time
[0:12:32] <Medo3G> it's all about bloodborne vs tetris
[0:12:33] <%Ne1son> Because its a clown bracket for silly people, why is anyone taking it seriously??
[0:12:34] <tanarath> BECAUSE FABLE 2 IS THE BEST, CLEARLY
[0:12:34] <%RealThiele> Dear game publishers, i accept cash bribes
[0:12:35] <haitakaa> because you can shit you pants and have unprotected sex in Fable 2 Pat
[0:12:35] <%cooldude69xx> Why hold this "tournament" now anyway?
[0:12:36] <%TheWinged7> how much ign dick did rockstar suck
[0:12:38] <%Monkeyweed21> its way worse than Fable 1
[0:12:38] <PirateMike_> Why is Peter Molyneux not in prison
[0:12:43] <+Nahual_Amini> Outer Wilds is best in my heart
[0:12:44] <+invida> Fable 2 is great, but not GOAT-tier
[0:12:44] <%Nordguy> I like Fable 2's opening
[0:12:48] <SaltyAzteca> @logoth_ NO STOP, DONT GIVE IT LIFE
[0:12:49] <%Nordguy> that's it
[0:12:50] <@tizz86> thanks for reaffirming my view on IGN LUL
[0:12:59] <%Dova573> LOL

[0:13:11] <PirateMike_> Pat are you into the battlefield games?
[0:13:11] <%cooldude69xx> @JoshManVGH You don;t understand man, BotW was a stumbling dull open world. So visionary!
[0:13:17] <%Ne1son> Thats literally all it is
[0:13:22] <%ScreamLord> TF2 PC is dead

[0:13:22] <tanarath> I'm sorry, how?
[0:13:31] <SaltyAzteca> HOW
[0:13:34] <SlangPunk> Remember everyone, the whole point of the poll is to keep you talking about IGN
[0:13:37] <shevan123> is outer wilds on the list?
[0:13:37] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Nice
[0:13:38] <atgithursdays> WHY IS CHRONO TRIGGER ON THERE ITS SO OLD
[0:13:39] <SiameseSneeze> Hey Pat, you're great
[0:13:44] <%logoth_> Titanfall 2, the game Respawn neglected into fucking death
[0:13:46] <%Undenizen> my pick is Undertale. that game changed me.
[0:13:49] <devanmuse> that's a specific number
[0:13:55] <+ShedVolans> The list should just all be Outer Wilds
[0:13:56] <%RealThiele> @atgithursdays ILL KILL YOU
[0:13:56] <Medo3G> it's user voting so it's BS anyways
[0:13:57] <marvel877> AT MINIMUM
[0:14:00] <%logoth_> and Apex Legends, a game that can't have an update without a week of it being unplayable

[0:14:14] <+NopeBadguy> DEMOCRACY FAILS AGAIN

[0:14:41] <cheapdoc> God of |War 1, yes
[0:14:42] <%kraken_lab> Lol
[0:14:44] <+MrBotchamania> 240 is a highly composite number.
[0:14:44] <+Ardailec> Aside from the Playstation exclusivity yeah
[0:14:44] <%dekkitout> Dad of boi is a very videogame videogame
[0:14:45] <shevan123> just played it recently and that game is completely solid to recommend
[0:14:47] <+Delenay> i havent gone to ign in a year, they kinda suck imo
[0:14:47] <%kraken_lab> Damned by faint praise
[0:14:57] <%Willbo_Baggins> THE DLC IS SO GOOD

[0:15:20] <%Mr_Pylon> No lifed the hell out of this DLC
[0:15:24] <FleshFriend> I heard it's about as "long" as the base game, so I'm really excited
[0:15:24] <%ahomeschooldropout> I never played  Outer Wilds but what you just said made me extremely interested
[0:15:24] <%Deekman> I'm gonna stick around for the preamble but then i gotta bail out so as not to spoil it for myself lol
[0:15:25] <iosephe> It sure does!

[0:16:14] <%dekkitout> Peach here for a space game- so it is inherently spoopy
[0:16:14] <KasiCrafter> I think they put the warning BECAUSE of the fish
[0:16:17] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> No mold in them right
[0:16:17] <@tizz86> Urethra Leeches
[0:16:17] <+ShedVolans> This will make you shit your pants even more than anglers

[0:31:30] <atgithursdays> i dunno man you dont think rats can swim
[0:31:31] <Zeif00> A waterfall is a point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops.

[0:34:15] <%kraken_lab> Timber hearth feels like a ps2 adventure action platformer level
[0:34:16] <azureborb> cool of them to add an in-universe explanation for the map screen
[0:34:22] <Teras_ode> tactical bites za dusto
[0:34:24] <zzNamttamzz> Maybe if you kill your wife
[0:34:25] <yeanahnah> I guess excruciating pain is worth saving a few seconds
[0:34:26] <AoiRob> walking woulda been faster ykno

[0:35:13] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Crash in 5.....

[0:35:48] <cheapdoc> Do you remember these?
[0:35:49] <leole11> @TheRealNumberJ42 i had to take a break yesterday, beat it today :)
[0:35:49] <%topendbuzza> pat never did the lava moon huh
[0:35:54] <nomos42> @TheRealNumberJ42 I got stuck a couple times yeh, just had to think on it
[0:35:55] <FleshFriend> nice
[0:35:56] <TheButtravage> So is this DLC added content the world or a whole new instance?
[0:35:58] <$lotharrio> Immediately fly into the sun, plz

[0:36:10] <Calek> @TheButtravage just keep watching

[0:36:26] <%DrTomT18> you can destroy the radio tower?
[0:36:27] <%Deekman> And here’s where I bail out. Catch you in the vids!
[0:36:37] <%baka_sugoi> CHAIR
[0:36:39] <leole11> LMAO I MISSED THIS
[0:36:44] <Teras_ode> @topendbuzza "did" as in, flew straight into it on autopilot while petting Elmo
[0:36:48] <%dekkitout> A watched pot never boils
[0:36:55] <AMERICA_YEA> this game is amazing
[0:36:55] <+Amripai> @TheButtravage its kinda like the artorias dlc where the way to get to it is in the main world but its a new area
[0:37:08] <RyeBreadBakery> ooo new meditation?
[0:37:23] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp
[0:37:35] <TheButtravage> @TheButtravage Thanks, wanted to know since I'll probably play it for myself.
[0:37:37] <%DrTomT18> Interloper literally ruined everything
[0:37:39] <$ringabal> The burning is part of the experience, the peon...
[0:37:41] <cnry_m> ZOOM OUT
[0:37:41] <vVAstrAVv> BURNING IT MAKES IT GOOEY
[0:37:42] <AoiRob> zoom out a lil
[0:37:44] <FleshFriend> "jerk" is an understatement
[0:37:46] <%sporeian94> fuck that planet only reason I never beat the game
[0:37:48] <tmvct1> NOT THE FISH!
[0:37:52] <leole11> hope you liked dark bramble!
[0:37:56] <chaosbringer28> might want to record the sound before you leave
[0:38:08] <%TheWinged7> can we get a poll on how many times pat flies into the sun this dlc?
[0:38:12] <chaosbringer28> gotta get on the roof for it to give the name
[0:38:15] <%DrTomT18> That's Gabbro
[0:38:17] <%twistedj3ster> oh no, math
[0:38:19] <Teras_ode> satelite selfie
[0:38:25] <AoiRob> gabbro
[0:38:43] <%kraken_lab> wait
[0:38:53] <KasiCrafter> wait
[0:38:55] <%Monkeyweed21> wait a photo of the quantum moon
[0:39:00] <KasiCrafter> They have a PICTURE of the Quantum Moon?
[0:39:01] <%kraken_lab> if they took a picture of the quatum moon here why is it still moving
[0:39:02] <%dekkitout> A photo of q-moon? Shouldn't that melt reality
[0:39:03] <+ShedVolans> Hmmm, stranger indeed
[0:39:14] <@TheYellowcouch> puzzle time
[0:39:15] <%baka_sugoi> MAN
[0:39:18] <$Ziegsy> this is just myst
[0:39:19] <leole11> BIG THINK
[0:39:20] <Calek> @dekkitout of course not
[0:39:21] <%kraken_lab> I think the picture needs to be recent to work tbh
[0:39:22] <%SpoonheadInExile> One of these things is not like the other
[0:39:22] <+upandadam> 4Head 4Head
[0:39:23] <Mr_Rakjo> SHADOW PÑANET
[0:39:23] <shevan123> oh boy
[0:39:25] <egressanon> someone needs to look at the pic to lock the moon
[0:39:27] <RyeBreadBakery> is that the quantum moon?
[0:39:27] <AoiRob> one of these is not like the others
[0:39:28] <%G_Thunders> @kraken_lab you have to be looking at the picture
[0:39:29] <Mr_Rakjo> spooky
[0:39:34] <+upandadam> what's the man doing to his anus
[0:39:38] <TheRealNumberJ42> @Ziegsy it's myst but in spaaaaaace
[0:39:40] <%RetroCop87> @PatStaresAt have you seen the no-fog mod for Dark Branble? Shit is terrifying
[0:39:41] <%sporeian94> the dark moon?
[0:39:41] <AoiRob> aight class lets count
[0:39:41] <%kraken_lab> If enough time passed then it Oh good point
[0:39:47] <%whyskeywolfe> IT'S PLUTO
[0:39:48] <$Futurecity10> Quantum moon?
[0:39:49] <%DrTomT18> you have to get realyl close to it
[0:39:51] <nomos42> lol I totally missed it when I first came here
[0:39:54] <ZE_Count> get close to get signsl
[0:39:55] <%DrTomT18> I don't know why
[0:39:57] <CrematedCube> Is it a Yuggoth?
[0:40:00] <cheapdoc> It's Uranus
[0:40:04] <%Eaglestrike117> Quantum moon?
[0:40:04] <Go4theKnees> you have to be observing a picture for it to stay
[0:40:07] <$Ziegsy> @TheRealNumberJ42 Space myst? Groovy
[0:40:13] <%DrTomT18> It's Hugo the Living Planet
[0:40:15] <vVAstrAVv> jump up for signal
[0:40:17] <crazypieman7> @PatStaresAt you gotta get on the roof if you wanna get rid of the "new signal detected" thing
[0:40:19] <AoiRob> pat just get closer to the signal
[0:40:20] <DianaTheAscian> I thought the quantum moon was the heart?
[0:40:21] <leole11> IT'S JUST A MALFUNCTION, DON'T WORRY
[0:40:34] <vVAstrAVv> but you dont really need the signal anyways
[0:40:37] <%G_Thunders> There’s no way to remember this from the base game, but you have to be like 5 meters from a signal for it to save
[0:40:41] <+malacante> Remember you need to get right up on a signal to identify it
[0:40:42] <nomos42> there
[0:40:46] <Zudrag> arf
[0:40:48] <%crashzilla_> I completed this DLC yesterday. It's fucking awesome!!!
[0:40:53] <+Thickiequicks> new frequency too
[0:40:54] <egressanon> but if one person looks at a pic of the moon on dark bramble and another stares at the moon currently at timber hearth at the same time, what happens
[0:41:09] <+upandadam> @egressanon universe explodes
[0:41:10] <%derpy_platypus> drone
[0:41:12] <+upandadam> there is precedent
[0:41:17] <SlangPunk> @dianatheascian Nope, but it’s connected to it. I won’t post the spoilers here if people care still
[0:41:24] <egressanon> true
[0:41:26] <Teras_ode> that was too small
[0:41:30] <%kraken_lab> @egressanon The moon can only be in one position
[0:41:31] <waltzqueen> BORK
[0:41:32] <Treasure_Vault> Can you try and mimic the angle with your spaceship?
[0:41:35] <AoiRob> now just use the radio to look for other signals
[0:41:37] <DianaTheAscian> @SiameseSneeze k
[0:41:46] <+Thickiequicks> pupper
[0:41:50] <egressanon> I hope Pat's ready for the big scares coming
[0:41:55] <tmvct1> uh oh
[0:41:55] <RyeBreadBakery> whoa!
[0:41:55] <+upandadam> lol
[0:41:56] <bear_breaker20> 24000m
[0:41:56] <%derpy_platypus> orbit
[0:42:00] <iosephe> gravity
[0:42:01] <HibikiYamada> lmao
[0:42:01] <+upandadam> pat's not ready for space
[0:42:01] <leole11> gravity
[0:42:04] <nomos42> I'm looking forward to pat having more WTF moments, this game is great
[0:42:06] <RyeBreadBakery> good jorb
[0:42:06] <%VHGS> broke your ship is what you did
[0:42:07] <%DrTomT18> you can auto pilot, Pat
[0:42:07] <harmless_toast> RIP ship
[0:42:15] <%Nordguy> what if all the remaining aliens are gay, do we let them go extinct?
[0:42:15] <AoiRob> pat the planet has gravity
[0:42:18] <ZE_Count> dog hate space
[0:42:21] <Teras_ode> it begins
[0:42:31] <%AncelDeLambert> hey, at least it didn't shatter like it did that one time for me
[0:42:32] <AoiRob> 10 meters is in fact not enough to break orbit
[0:42:33] <Medo3G> no just play perfectly
[0:42:34] <%derpy_platypus> who needs a hull?
[0:42:40] <%stubborndeer> Never take off that helmet
[0:42:41] <%cooldude69xx> How do you do a flip in this game?
[0:42:42] <%SpoonheadInExile> Yeah, but whose fault is that? :P
[0:42:45] <leole11> someone in the 1600 wrote something or other about gravity
[0:42:45] <@TheYellowcouch> remember: Do not post spoilers or solutions unless Pat asks for it
[0:42:47] <+Delenay> red star
[0:42:47] <%stubborndeer> Unless you KNOW there is oxygen
[0:42:55] <CrematedCube> So far this sounds a lot like Yuggoth, aka Planet Lovecraft
[0:42:55] <nomos42> that sun's getting big
[0:42:56] <+malacante> Fair warning I feel like the ship log holds your hand a lot less in this DLC.
[0:42:58] <%derpy_platypus> only a thin layer between you and the vast vacuum of space
[0:43:01] <%AncelDeLambert> only 27 clicks?
[0:43:01] <%DrTomT18> bro, lock L
[0:43:05] <CrematedCube> But I know nothing
[0:43:09] <+FutaSnek> @theyellowcouch Thank you

[0:43:16] <nomos42> wrong thruster

[0:43:24] <%dekkitout> What's your vector, Victor?
[0:43:26] <+Byronic_dreamer> First thing i did starting this was accidentally fly into the sun
[0:43:26] <+Sutibun95> Left stick to lock on, Pat
[0:43:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> lol Pat
[0:43:27] <$lotharrio> Look out! It's an evil sun! Quick! Smack it away with your ship!
[0:43:28] <+tomdwarf> Well, its very far away, and your not flying towards it, or its flying away from you
[0:43:29] <ChungusQuest> Just a little rust
[0:43:30] <%linSP> piloting is hard

[0:44:02] <RyeBreadBakery> too far
[0:44:02] <+JPivot> yeah its tryin gto autopilot you back into the solar system
[0:44:03] <tanarath> autopilot?
[0:44:06] <xxMylord> did the satelite colide with something LUL ?
[0:44:06] <+upandadam> lol don't tell him
[0:44:06] <%DrTomT18> just let the computer do its job
[0:44:07] <egressanon> but if I autopilot then pilot ceases to be
[0:44:08] <%derpy_platypus> nyooooom
[0:44:08] <+JPivot> you didnt lock onto the thing you were looking at
[0:44:11] <AMERICA_YEA> you need to lock on to the object you are currently autopiloting to the radio tower
[0:44:11] <%Undenizen> how many minutes do you have again?
[0:44:12] <%CatastropheCorvid> Twitch is broken for me, how long has he been streaming?
[0:44:14] <leole11> you haven't targeted the right thing
[0:44:18] <RyeBreadBakery> :0
[0:44:18] <+Mondeiya> are you locked onto something else?
[0:44:20] <Zudrag> is it locked onto the radio tower still?
[0:44:20] <Calek> isn't he locked onto the radio tower
[0:44:23] <stoatacious> this is gonna be rough lol
[0:44:23] <%linSP> uhhh

[0:44:26] <@TheYellowcouch> 44 minutes
[0:44:28] <+Thickiequicks> target
[0:44:33] <DianaTheAscian> I wonder if this game can make people nauseous
[0:44:33] <frontshuv> locked onto the radio tower still
[0:44:33] <TheRealNumberJ42> almonds are activating
[0:44:34] <leole11> yes
[0:44:36] <vVAstrAVv> @catastrophecorvid maybe 20 minutes
[0:44:37] <nomos42> gotta lock on yeh
[0:44:37] <%CatastropheCorvid> @TheYellowcouch Thanks!
[0:44:38] <AoiRob> are you actually locked on to it?
[0:44:42] <%Undenizen> @CatastropheCorvid we're only a few minutes into the game proper
[0:44:42] <%Treuan> If the lockon isn't working rebinding the key in options should fix it,
[0:44:44] <+Thickiequicks> hmm
[0:44:47] <harmless_toast> autopilot takes you to whatever you're locked on to. You just autopiloted to the sun
[0:44:48] <nomos42> ahhhh
[0:44:48] <vvastrel> nice radio tower lock on
[0:44:48] <%baka_sugoi> F A R
[0:44:49] <FleshFriend> huh
[0:44:49] <%Treuan> It was a glitch for me too
[0:44:50] <cnry_m> Pat . . .
[0:44:50] <yeanahnah> I think lock on is bugged, reset controls maybe?
[0:44:52] <%Buzzard42> check keybinds
[0:44:52] <$dalmek> @PatStaresAt that's kinda a bug, if you move the mouse you can fix that
[0:44:52] <ordinary_electric> @pat pretty sure you're not locked onto it
[0:44:52] <chaosbringer28> use mouse
[0:44:53] <%AyotoCorp> You're pressing RS
[0:44:54] <+BIumen> fast
[0:44:55] <chaosbringer28> its a gltich
[0:44:55] <%CatastropheCorvid> Thanks guys
[0:44:57] <leole11> uhhh, check config, you ARE able
[0:44:58] <%linSP> yeah it was glitchy for me too
[0:44:58] <+tomdwarf> It looks like a small red planetoid, or like a red dwarf?
[0:44:58] <M4eta> remap the lock
[0:45:00] <AoiRob> use mouse
[0:45:02] <%chiazam> Is it outside your space
[0:45:03] <Go4theKnees> I had a lock on bug too

[0:45:12] <+malacante> Locking glitches for me too
[0:45:13] <chaosbringer28> first time the game gets launch L3 doesnt work until its used at least once with another control

[0:50:16] <Heyestus> The reward of incompetence
[0:50:17] <KasiCrafter> Learn from your mistakes!
[0:50:23] <AMERICA_YEA> @baka_sugoi DUduDUDU
[0:50:25] <tanarath> To remind you not to do it again
[0:50:26] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> @PatStaresAt You can go into menu to Meditate
[0:50:27] <+malacante> That wasn’t a very good Sun Station landing attempt
[0:50:32] <%twistedj3ster> do it not-bad this time
[0:50:36] <harmless_toast> the statue will remember your failures until the end of the universe. Luckily that's only about 20 minutes away
[0:50:39] <iosephe> Y
[0:50:45] <$ringabal> Nomai are shaking their collective space heads at Pat
[0:50:48] <cheapdoc> It's not in the map ...
[0:50:48] <leole11> you never landed on it
[0:50:50] <%DrTomT18> you have to find the signal then fly there
[0:50:50] <Medo3G> he really did not land hollow's lantern
[0:50:53] <AoiRob> Y
[0:50:56] <AMERICA_YEA> @baka_sugoi And I say It's alright
[0:50:57] <vVAstrAVv> triangle
[0:50:58] <chaosbringer28> its not on the log, only in map or with sound sensor
[0:50:59] <waltzqueen> You can land on 1 spot on Hollow's Lantern but its hard
[0:51:00] <%derpy_platypus> Round 2
[0:51:00] <%linSP> you never went inside brittle hollow's volcanic moon?
[0:51:01] <TheRealNumberJ42> lmao pleb
[0:51:04] <%Theycallmenerf> Wow that ship looks like shit
[0:51:07] <%dekkitout> Hollow lantern was skippable?
[0:51:12] <CrematedCube> It's a very optional thing
[0:51:17] <+Thickiequicks> old spacey
[0:51:18] <%DrTomT18> Yes
[0:51:21] <$Futurecity10> yeah you can go into the volcano for hollows lantern
[0:51:21] <pth88> =yeah the lantern had only a few info things
[0:51:23] <%DrTomT18> it's just flavor text
[0:51:23] <Medo3G> technically everything is skippable
[0:51:26] <%Monkeyweed21> OH I GET IT
[0:51:27] <$Futurecity10> pat never did
[0:51:28] <%stubborndeer> Wouldn't it be fucking fantastic if your stupid planet had AN ATMOSPHERE
[0:51:31] <%Buzzard42> @dekkitout technically everything in Outer Wilds is skippable
[0:51:31] <leole11> Hollow Lantern only has a single clue, and it's not important
[0:51:32] <Nurdock> There's like one thing in one of the volcanoes on it
[0:51:36] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Hit it again
[0:51:42] <%Monkeyweed21> the probe was in one of the photos
[0:51:46] <%linSP> pog pog pog
[0:51:47] <+ShedVolans> Maximum acceleration
[0:51:50] <%asgard147> So how's the dlc?
[0:51:51] <Teras_ode> you did "run into" it as I recall
[0:52:03] <%Theycallmenerf> Chat I skipped Outer Wilds, because it saved me money and time.
[0:52:04] <hassanico2> Hi chat, any new content yet?
[0:52:11] <AoiRob> just use your jetpack instead of the entire ship
[0:52:11] <TheRealNumberJ42> the dlc is great, pat hasn't started it yet :P

[0:52:24] <harmless_toast> @hassanico2 yes, this satellite
[0:52:24] <leole11> every time i exit the ship in outer space, i get the most sudden sense of vertigo
[0:52:29] <vVAstrAVv> remember pat. 40 degrees
[0:52:30] <%Theycallmenerf> Hit it: The DLC

[1:03:21] <HiveMasterMind> Were these guys here before the Nomai?!

[1:03:27] <@Ranryu692> Lakeview Cabin? Is this where Jason ended up after Jason X?
[1:03:28] <EternalJedi> it looks like Rivendell, are these Space Elves?
[1:03:29] <$Futurecity10> @harmless_toast Endgame crisis imminent
[1:03:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah its pretty chill for being a Halo
[1:03:31] <%hat_under_bread> True luxury in the spacefaring age is organic material.
[1:03:33] <%DrTomT18> Gonna go out on a limb and say this isn't Nomai
[1:03:36] <AzureGale> Is this Halo
[1:03:39] <%RealThiele> space yggdrasil?
[1:03:41] <%baka_sugoi> SQUEAK
[1:03:42] <%linSP> ring earthers went too far
[1:03:44] <%A_Zealous_Retort> was that gief
[1:03:45] <@TheYellowcouch> Welcome to Silent Dyson sphere
[1:03:45] <%Frost_Quill> I thought that was in the game for a second.
[1:03:46] <RyeBreadBakery> oh the squeak from the toy spooked me omg
[1:03:46] <%lumporr> squeequog
[1:03:46] <AoiRob> was this like a vacation spot
[1:03:46] <dyllustrate> Is this game like MYST?
[1:03:47] <hassanico2> SQUEAKY ALIENS
[1:03:47] <$Ziegsy> S Q U E A K
[1:03:47] <%Caped_Eggy> That scared me LUL
[1:03:47] <jorniev> GOD THAT DOG SCARED ME
[1:03:47] <%AncelDeLambert> SQUEAK
[1:03:48] <ZE_Count> baby oneil cylender
[1:03:49] <AluxStreams> I shit myself when Zangeif squeaked that toy
[1:03:49] <Ipsenscastle> fucking hell Gief, scared the shit outta me
[1:03:49] <%baka_sugoi> BIG PPL
[1:03:50] <%skizzuto> that was the most ominous chew toy squeak I've ever heard
[1:03:52] <Aiutare47> it looks a bit like your planet
[1:03:52] <%TheWinged7> SQUAK
[1:03:54] <jamesthebrave> That squeak made me jump so bad!
[1:03:55] <devanmuse> did anybody else get scared by that squeak?
[1:03:56] <%ElkRiverDog> As a lifelong Alien fan, the acid burns on the floor give me CONCERN
[1:03:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe they're normal sized
[1:03:57] <ChungusQuest> The Outer Wilds universe has highly advanced woodtech
[1:03:58] <Go4theKnees> any jumpers
[1:03:58] <harmless_toast> no, you're just short
[1:03:58] <stoatacious> zangief scared the SHIT outta me
[1:03:58] <vVAstrAVv> outer wilds DOES take influence from national parks
[1:03:59] <RayMan799> Baby's first Halo
[1:04:00] <$ringabal> Space Elves, got it
[1:04:01] <%linSP> 1.3x grav
[1:04:01] <%DrTomT18> By .3
[1:04:04] <%Undenizen> oh god... is this innsmouth?
[1:04:05] <%kraken_lab> Man it seems like all the aliens in this game are taller then you
[1:04:06] <Teras_ode> like the tech and shipbay looks alien as fuck and then there's these plain old wooden houses all of a sudden
[1:04:09] <+twohitgood> maybe that's also why you're shorter?
[1:04:09] <RyuuAoi> That squeak scared the shit out me ha
[1:04:09] <%kraken_lab> Oh shit oh shit
[1:04:11] <%SpoonheadInExile> That's counter intuitive...
[1:04:11] <+cursedwithadhd> does that mean you are now Master chief
[1:04:19] <FleshFriend> you know these aliens are strong then
[1:04:19] <+tomdwarf> Meaning that their planet was huge, or bigger than your earth equivelant.
[1:04:20] <%A_Zealous_Retort> gravity gets stronger the lower you go
[1:04:21] <$lotharrio> Sounds like you should train, here.
[1:04:21] <Teras_ode> the gap is eerie
[1:04:21] <%baka_sugoi> Believe John HALO
[1:04:21] <captain_kirkhammer> Yeah centrifugal force can be a motherfucker
[1:04:26] <%SpoonheadInExile> Wouldn't stronger gravity make people shorter?
[1:04:26] <AoiRob> stronger than your planet at least
[1:04:27] <%kraken_lab> what if you can make the gravity lower by reducing the spin of the ring?
[1:04:34] <nomos42> the gravity is from the spinning yeh
[1:04:36] <ne0bunny> like taller race would live in stronger gravity?
[1:04:36] <%A_Zealous_Retort> or rather gravity gets stronger the further from the center you are
[1:04:38] <%greasypete00> was there more content added or soemthing?
[1:04:41] <+Pulsewing> Hey Pat, how big does the DLC seem to be in comparison to the base game so far?
[1:04:41] <+Delenay> behind you
[1:04:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> i foresee there being many more slide reels
[1:04:49] <Ipsenscastle> wait, do you have to travel here over and over every time the cycle ends?
[1:04:49] <harmless_toast> are we gonna watch a slideshow of your vacation pictures now?
[1:04:59] <%RealThiele> ohhh myy
[1:05:03] <%linSP> lucky
[1:05:03] <FleshFriend> yeah this looks like a resort or something for these aliens

[1:05:08] <+FutaSnek> is bagul gonna come out>?

[1:05:16] <Calek> @Ipsenscastle yeah

[1:05:17] <+Ultimate_Edge> Light based technology is cool
[1:05:19] <%Valdorick> Look at this myst ass myst zone.
[1:05:25] <%A_Zealous_Retort> projector needs light?
[1:05:31] <%Axellogic> Use flashlight on slide maybe?
[1:05:34] <%Undenizen> it's an alien race of taxidermists.
[1:05:38] <+BIumen> there's a damn over your head wtf
[1:05:38] <leole11> nice dam :)
[1:05:40] <captain_kirkhammer> You  obviouslyt need time stop
[1:05:40] <Ipsenscastle> @Valdorick that's exactly what I said!
[1:05:41] <%Agami23> my brain has trouble making sense of what im seeing
[1:05:43] <%linSP> remember your scout emits light
[1:05:44] <%twistedj3ster> understandable
[1:05:46] <%kraken_lab> Yo i said it looked like space myst when I first saw it
[1:05:46] <+FutaSnek> This is quite whelming

[1:06:59] <hassanico2> Is there a ceiling light?
[1:06:59] <%topendbuzza> light?
[1:07:04] <%Undenizen> can you get that lantern from outside?
[1:07:05] <ZE_Count> look for a light I
[1:07:06] <pi_in_the_sci> guess you need a lantern
[1:07:06] <hassanico2> WAIT
[1:07:07] <Mr_Rakjo> oh iknow
[1:07:07] <hassanico2> THE scout?!
[1:07:10] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Maybe there is a light source you can drop inside?
[1:07:11] <+Mondeiya> look around some more
[1:07:13] <hassanico2> Can the scout put a light?
[1:07:13] <Mr_Rakjo> yer
[1:07:13] <leole11> that's going to take for ever
[1:07:15] <%kraken_lab> He has to ask for help
[1:07:15] <+upandadam> amongus?
[1:07:16] <nomos42> not like this
[1:07:16] <Aiutare47> does your scout have a light
[1:07:16] <iosephe> oh no
[1:07:19] <Abyssal_Jaguar> SCout! good idea!
[1:07:19] <+CookieCutter007> hmm
[1:07:20] <%linSP> theres a LOT of slides, you can use your scout to make it easier
[1:07:20] <+Zilla93> need a light?
[1:07:22] <%KoiRedd> The industrial and architectural logic is bizarre in this game. Let's build a mega advanced cloaked space station but fill it with wooden building and make satelites out of barrels!
[1:07:23] <+FutaSnek> @Saltmeisterr thevir16SUSSY
[1:07:24] <+cursedwithadhd> portable light source

[1:07:28] <+rafaelba93> no spoilers guys
[1:07:32] <RyeBreadBakery> SMART
[1:07:34] <%laserbeaming> even with the scout he won't be able to look at the full thing
[1:07:34] <%A_Zealous_Retort> light needs to be IN the projector to center it
[1:07:35] <hassanico2> YEAH I GOT IT
[1:07:36] <%drabberfaun535> How come you cant find a nice thriving civilization? its always dead ones

[1:08:02] <%DrTomT18> Too much light
[1:08:02] <+FutaSnek> @drabberfaun535 Those are way harder to write LUL
[1:08:03] <harmless_toast> is it? looks a lot like nothing to be LUL
[1:08:03] <nmaten> is it?
[1:08:05] <%derpy_platypus> find tool
[1:08:05] <jorniev> above?
[1:08:05] <Louie_Salmon> But now it's so bright it washes out the image
[1:08:06] <Mr_Rakjo> are those some eyes wtf
[1:08:11] <AoiRob> nah it sucks
[1:08:11] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oh its a slideshow video
[1:08:11] <$ringabal> OH FUCK I KNOW WHATS COMIN
[1:08:11] <wibbwobbler> SeemsGood
[1:08:12] <DigiLapin> try a different building?
[1:08:12] <+Sutibun95> This ain't it
[1:08:12] <Teras_ode> monkaS did I just see eyes
[1:08:13] <%linSP> pretty sure its intentional
[1:08:15] <%RealThiele> spooky eyes

[1:08:16] <Zeif00> monkaS
[1:08:18] <$ringabal> NOPE NU UH
[1:08:21] <Ipsenscastle> those were some scary eyes
[1:08:22] <%Undenizen> those slides look like they were taken from inside a living thing
[1:08:23] <%Axellogic> Maybe we need a better light
[1:08:24] <AoiRob> just looks for something else
[1:08:24] <%kyh9> Holy shit
[1:08:24] <+ShedVolans> lmao Well I didn't consider this "solution"
[1:08:26] <+JustToWatch> seems tricky, have you tried flying directly into the sun?
[1:08:31] <+Thickiequicks> take a stroll
[1:08:31] <Edsta94> @mr_rakjo some slides are burnt
[1:08:37] <WordsHere> I didn't think to try that either
[1:08:40] <+cursedwithadhd> what's down the stairs on your left
[1:08:41] <+Jack8274> It's like watching porn before the internet
[1:08:42] <+ShedVolans> Gotta steal some light from the sun
[1:08:43] <TheRealNumberJ42> i guess pat has never used a projector before
[1:08:46] <harmless_toast> maybe there's a better light somewhere else?
[1:08:47] <Mr_Rakjo> the true shadow pussles
[1:08:50] <AoiRob> just go somewhere else
[1:08:51] <Mr_Rakjo> puzzles*
[1:08:51] <vVAstrAVv> pat just go somewhere else itll be obvious later
[1:08:52] <%DrTomT18> Pat maybe you should look around town

[1:10:29] <RyeBreadBakery> ooooh thihs music
[1:10:30] <+FutaSnek> This is super cinematic, not to use that like people do for games all the time this just has a real movielike quality to it
[1:10:31] <%BinaryFireball> give the man his coin
[1:10:32] <Teras_ode> that was great timing tho gotta be honest
[1:10:33] <%topendbuzza> ehh more to see
[1:10:34] <AoiRob> just vibe man
[1:10:34] <harmless_toast> you were lost a the beginning of the base game too, you'll get your bearings
[1:10:35] <+SeanPrime22> that feeling of being lost wont go away any time soon
[1:10:36] <%asgard147> Thanks boat friend limesHug
[1:10:37] <%KoiRedd> That's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen...!
[1:10:40] <HiveMasterMind> That was the coolest time transition on a planet yet
[1:10:41] <jkfd> the music in this game is something else
[1:10:45] <%kyh9> FEELS GOOD DOESNT IT
[1:10:46] <%Frost_Quill> The sun's gravity making the water tip more to one side as it goes supernova I guess???
[1:10:58] <Chaos_Aether> a dam look like it broke
[1:10:59] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Bye mr raft!
[1:11:12] <captain_kirkhammer> @Frost_Quill that wouldn't affect it irl but who knows in game
[1:11:14] <Louie_Salmon> @frost_quill Or just poor construction. mo
[1:11:14] <%CTMathiu> that music tho
[1:11:15] <vVAstrAVv> @frost_quill a dam broke
[1:11:16] <%DrTomT18> you'll know when the music starts
[1:11:18] <%laserbeaming> I believe the collapse is about 10 minutes in
[1:11:18] <%Valdorick> Open the System Map?
[1:11:20] <+Mr_Misanthropy> I bought the outer worlds thinking it was this game.
[1:11:21] <+MrBotchamania> This raft song rocks
[1:11:21] <hassanico2> ...would the sun explosion reach in here?
[1:11:25] <nomos42> @Frost_Quill but the sun's gravity wouldn't change, I think it's just old
[1:11:26] <+BIumen> are the water physics still going up there?
[1:11:27] <%baka_sugoi> GONE
[1:11:28] <%ctk96> creepy clown
[1:11:29] <RyeBreadBakery> got updated like three times
[1:11:32] <+FutaSnek> The song plays when you have like a min
[1:11:32] <%Undenizen> I'm very confused about the shape of this place.
[1:11:35] <AoiRob> borken
[1:11:38] <Teras_ode> it has updated atleast two times
[1:11:41] <%Frost_Quill> Is it?
[1:11:42] <%tactician0> oh no there it go
[1:11:44] <%SirGO0SE> limesFeels
[1:11:44] <%Axellogic> Is it?
[1:11:44] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt There's a sunken structure near the beach here?
[1:11:44] <leole11> that's a reflection pat
[1:11:44] <%kraken_lab> Its a ring
[1:11:44] <%lumporr> man this is disorientating
[1:11:47] <%Weeabooninja> that's not the sun
[1:11:47] <nomos42> that's a refleciton
[1:11:47] <%topendbuzza> nope
[1:11:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think thats a reflection
[1:11:48] <pth88> i dont think thats the sun
[1:11:49] <%kyh9> This is unironically what I want Halo Infinite to be
[1:11:51] <egressanon> @mr_misanthropy but the first hour was pretty good, right?
[1:11:52] <AoiRob> @Undenizen it's a ring
[1:11:52] <%kyh9> Small ring world
[1:11:53] <%Monkeyweed21> no it isnt
[1:11:55] <RyeBreadBakery> try it bet
[1:11:55] <+Delenay> the shape is a short cylinder
[1:11:55] <%baka_sugoi> jump
[1:11:57] <pi_in_the_sci> jetpack?
[1:11:58] <$lotharrio> Sun! Sun! Sun!
[1:12:00] <AMERICA_YEA> @Undenizen think colony from gundam
[1:12:03] <Ipsenscastle> @Undenizen inside of a big cylinder
[1:12:04] <chaosbringer28> go swimming then?
[1:12:05] <%topendbuzza> jet pack
[1:12:06] <Edsta94> maybe it detected the supernova and started to drift away causing the shift in gravity of the waterflow?
[1:12:06] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I wonder if you fly to the center if you'll spin around because gravity doesn't know where down is
[1:12:08] <%baka_sugoi> DO IT
[1:12:09] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the tower that the flood sent you to seemed promising
[1:12:11] <chaosbringer28> try not to die while doing so
[1:12:11] <%strakillias> I left for like 5 minutes and now pat is on halo.
[1:12:13] <%twistedj3ster> fly you fool
[1:12:13] <ChungusQuest> Will the raft come back around?
[1:12:13] <vVAstrAVv> not even the sun lol
[1:12:16] <+FutaSnek> For anyone who's confused its like HALO
[1:12:18] <waltzqueen> NICE
[1:12:20] <AoiRob> just keep swimming just keep swimming
[1:12:20] <%SpoonheadInExile> Wait a minute, if this is a cylinder, how is the water flowing at all? Wouldn't centrifugal inertia stop that?
[1:12:22] <%kraken_lab> Its a ringworld, it generates 'downward force' for the people on it via rotation
[1:12:25] <DianaTheAscian> well
[1:12:26] <+Mr_Misanthropy> @egressanon  LUL Big true.. I could not go the distance with that game..
[1:12:29] <AoiRob> knees gone
[1:12:31] <%buerdo> Does the sun get brighter as it explode?
[1:12:32] <CrematedCube> It
[1:12:32] <+psidefx> Gotta love stix
[1:12:33] <leole11> @ChungusQuest with enough time and luck, yes actually
[1:12:34] <DianaTheAscian> or up
[1:12:35] <vVAstrAVv> cronch
[1:12:42] <Edsta94> @abyssal_jaguar you cant fly for longer then a few seconds
[1:12:46] <Teras_ode> time to crash on to the rocks
[1:12:47] <%kyh9> OMINOUS
[1:12:47] <CrematedCube> It donut
[1:12:54] <%ocelotshotfirst> @SpoonheadInExile There's a dam, it flows 'downhill'
[1:13:01] <%Keaton_x> It's a loop. It doesn't stop..
[1:13:05] <+kableb> is pat going to unleash the Flood on this solar system and have to fire this thing
[1:13:12] <+FutaSnek> Come to think of it a HALO ref somewhere would be dope given the ringworld settingf LUL
[1:13:17] <RyeBreadBakery> this is so cool
[1:13:19] <%Monkeyweed21> lol the raft is back
[1:13:19] <+psidefx> I've heard the lake takes you around
[1:13:20] <Abyssal_Jaguar> True, but there hast to be a spot above them thats all fucky, I would love to see how that works
[1:13:20] <+BIumen> terrified to think this is then gonna get SCARY
[1:13:23] <%kraken_lab> God this is so fucking cool I like the space donut
[1:13:25] <%baka_sugoi> This thing reminds me of the space colonys in gundam
[1:13:28] <%DrTomT18> or you know, Halo
[1:13:31] <%kyh9> ITS SO COOL
[1:13:32] <%drabberfaun535> Guess you could say this civilization is pretty washed up
[1:13:33] <$ringabal> UM
[1:13:33] <hassanico2> I hate this place
[1:13:34] <AoiRob> lightbulb sun lol
[1:13:36] <DianaTheAscian> Its very gunda,
[1:13:38] <+BIumen> this is what sharlayan is building
[1:13:39] <+JPivot> there is a halo reference, actually
[1:13:41] <shevan123> a gundum colony that uses cloaking to hide itself
[1:13:43] <DianaTheAscian> gundam*
[1:13:45] <+FutaSnek> I suppose it was a fictional concept before HALO
[1:13:46] <%polothegreatest> is this the john halo planet?
[1:13:47] <%Valdorick> Drop it on the Ashtwins project, show those goat aliens to mess with time.
[1:13:50] <captain_kirkhammer> @SpoonheadInExile it would still reach an equilibrium state because no energy is being added to the system
[1:13:52] <AoiRob> what is that
[1:13:56] <$Futurecity10> I'm afraid of whats under the water
[1:14:02] <%baka_sugoi> Need more GUNDAM
[1:14:02] <egressanon> @biumen yeah it's good they put a warning on the title screen because I would NOT have been ready for that shit
[1:14:03] <%derpy_platypus> reflection
[1:14:05] <+FutaSnek> WOAH THATS DETAILED
[1:14:07] <%dekkitout> Isn't everything a reflection
[1:14:10] <DianaTheAscian> It's kinda like the texas colony
[1:14:11] <+Delenay> the suns on the green side
[1:14:12] <cureneckbeard> The Babylon Project was a dream given form
[1:14:13] <CrematedCube> It's been an idea since the 70s
[1:14:13] <shevan123> oh shit the panels have rgb panelling
[1:14:16] <%derpy_platypus> RED
[1:14:17] <ChungusQuest> the dark red sun
[1:14:17] <Abyssal_Jaguar> OH! The trees droop because of the extra gravity pulling them down!
[1:14:17] <%kraken_lab> Presumably, they pump it back up to the top
[1:14:17] <leole11> did you notice the little rgb lights for the screen?
[1:14:19] <%Valdorick> Sun looking kinda red
[1:14:21] <%kraken_lab> Via the dam
[1:14:23] <%kyh9> Lomp
[1:14:23] <%lumporr> @Futurecity10 more water!
[1:14:28] <%razielhex> does this have more great banjo music?
[1:14:30] <RyeBreadBakery> more slideshows
[1:14:30] <jkfd> that lamp though
[1:14:30] <Teras_ode> was some sort of rgb screen
[1:14:31] <DianaTheAscian> look aliens
[1:14:33] <%Weeabooninja> I love that you can see the LCDs in the monitors
[1:14:34] <+FutaSnek> danPop Sun
[1:14:35] <Aiutare47> was that a lamp back there?
[1:14:36] <AoiRob> hey look a light
[1:14:36] <%DrTomT18> blind
[1:14:37] <%Frost_Quill> So is this thing gonna be okay once the sun goes out?  It looks more advanced than the Nomai so it might survive???
[1:14:39] <stoatacious> pay.
[1:14:40] <crazypieman7> lamp?
[1:14:40] <%Undenizen> pick up the lantern in the other toom!
[1:14:42] <%baka_sugoi> STICK
[1:14:42] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Green lantern interactable in that first room?
[1:14:47] <%kyh9> Lomp?
[1:14:52] <stoatacious> this is the worst it's ever been
[1:14:55] <+kableb> aliens sure liked to sit
[1:14:56] <AoiRob> chillspot
[1:15:01] <%linSP> light expert
[1:15:03] <%Undenizen> that door opening animation is great for big spooks
[1:15:03] <IzanagiNoOokami> Shoot the probe behind you maybe?
[1:15:04] <+FutaSnek> How odd
[1:15:09] <Louie_Salmon> Cool house
[1:15:16] <$ringabal> Not with that attitude
[1:15:17] <Teras_ode> not anymore it aint
[1:15:19] <%Frost_Quill> Unlike the Nomai there's no corpses, so they didn't just die suddenly.
[1:15:20] <%Monkeyweed21> it used to be
[1:15:25] <jkfd> just pick up the lamp you walked past multiple times, pat
[1:15:29] <+Ultimate_Edge> Gotta love the country ranch decor
[1:15:34] <+psidefx> The people are owl-deer-men?
[1:15:35] <leole11> i love how the entire area makes you feel tiny, kinda like pat feels in real life
[1:15:35] <%Valdorick> swag
[1:15:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Is this what its like to be Pat?
[1:15:40] <%Frost_Quill> Is this gonna turn into Amnseia?
[1:15:40] <+tomdwarf> Question, is their some sort of time dilation/time stop while on the ringworld. Cause that supernova is gonna be a problem eventually
[1:15:40] <+Like51bears> YEAAAAAAAA
[1:15:41] <harmless_toast> zoeyNail

[1:16:14] <ChungusQuest> but where music?
[1:16:16] <tanarath> Are you sure that you don't?
[1:16:19] <%Undenizen> do you have any DOUBT?
[1:16:21] <%Frost_Quill> Maybe this place will survive the sun going out?
[1:16:21] <%derpy_platypus> cue music
[1:16:21] <+Delenay> it wasnt when you got here
[1:16:21] <%kyh9> Famous last words

[1:17:38] <maybefalco> the music in this is so fucking amazing
[1:17:39] <egressanon> doesn't matter if supernova can destroy it or not since ash twin nabs your brain anyway
[1:17:45] <Minorou> have you considered that things might not be ok
[1:17:46] <RyeBreadBakery> pog
[1:17:48] <%linSP> you have 15 seconds to solve it!
[1:17:49] <%tank7013> I always thought this song was oddly hopeful for something heralding the heat death of the universe

[1:18:25] <devanmuse> There's supposed to be a star shattering kaboom
[1:18:26] <+Ultimate_Edge> Light has to travel
[1:18:26] <waltzqueen> okay
[1:18:27] <heartlesshealer> How far is this from your sun????????
[1:18:28] <Ipsenscastle> LUL
[1:18:28] <%topendbuzza> too far?
[1:18:29] <%linSP> took a bit
[1:18:31] <hassanico2> LUL
[1:18:31] <%asgard147> oh never mind
[1:18:32] <DigiLapin> its VERY far away
[1:18:33] <%tank7013> LUL
[1:18:33] <KnivesEve> pretty light
[1:18:34] <$lotharrio> I guess, it's fine.
[1:18:34] <%kyh9> Very far away
[1:18:34] <leole11> yeah about that....
[1:18:34] <RyeBreadBakery> THAR SHE BLOOOOOWS
[1:18:34] <+kableb> oh thank god the sun exploded
[1:18:35] <+tomdwarf> yeah, cause having no supernova is worrying
[1:18:35] <HiveMasterMind> You can't hear it go boom in here
[1:18:35] <%ctk96> ok theres the boom
[1:18:35] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> wow youre far out
[1:18:36] <$lotharrio> Oh.
[1:18:36] <$dalmek> worried at the lack of a supernova
[1:18:37] <%Bluwizard21> oh thank god the end is here i was worried
[1:18:38] <%kraken_lab> There you go
[1:18:40] <%Faustgesicht> uh
[1:18:40] <heartlesshealer> okay you're super at the edge
[1:18:42] <%linSP> you died!
[1:18:44] <%Undenizen> you were worried you WEREN'T gonna die?
[1:18:44] <DianaTheAscian> All is good new
[1:18:45] <%Valdorick> Even if too far, the relic still sends him back 22 minutes
[1:18:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> thats new
[1:18:46] <%Frost_Quill> Oh you didn't even die.
[1:18:46] <+Yamchadassist> that was new
[1:18:46] <leole11> huh
[1:18:47] <egressanon> @frost_quill nah it does that thing that just happened
[1:18:48] <TheRealNumberJ42> hmmm
[1:18:49] <hewwogames> OH it destroyed ATP
[1:18:49] <leole11> isn't that odd
[1:18:49] <DianaTheAscian> now*
[1:18:49] <%tank7013> That was a unique death scene from the supernova one?
[1:18:50] <@TheYellowcouch> Dlc death
[1:18:51] <%Ne1son> You got nomaid
[1:18:51] <EternalJedi> that seemed new
[1:18:51] <AoiRob> a lil far
[1:18:52] <Medo3G> that's the ash twin project pulling you back
[1:18:52] <+twohitgood> that's quite a ways out
[1:18:54] <harmless_toast> that effect has been in the game for awhile. It happens when the ash twin project pulls your memories back before the supernova catches you
[1:18:54] <KasiCrafter> That's old
[1:18:56] <+Mondeiya> the twins be like "cant escape us hoe"
[1:18:58] <%tank7013> Is it like a failsafe?
[1:18:58] <Louie_Salmon> That is indeed new
[1:18:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> that happens if you're too far away from the sun
[1:18:58] <captain_kirkhammer> It happens sometimes if the sun explodes and you're way away from the system
[1:18:59] <M4eta> you are just far away
[1:19:01] <+FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt That happens if the loop triggers before you die
[1:19:02] <+cursedwithadhd> the machine got destroyed before you did
[1:19:03] <+JustToWatch> Welcome Back :)
[1:19:03] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt that place is past the edge of the system
[1:19:03] <%laserbeaming> That transition happens in the base game if you're too far from the Super Nova
[1:19:03] <Teras_ode> huh
[1:19:04] <stoatacious> that always happened
[1:19:05] <%asgard147> wait, were we too far away, so it brought us back?!
[1:19:06] <KasiCrafter> Remember, the Ash Twins get VAPORIZED
[1:19:06] <%razielhex> STARDEATHLOOP
[1:19:07] <AoiRob> just a vfx change dw
[1:19:08] <shevan123> i love how any difference in how things should go ends up scaring the shit out of people
[1:19:08] <mr_saturday93> "Where is the earth shattering kaboom?"
[1:19:09] <xxMylord> Ashtwin project got activated before you got hit by the nova
[1:19:12] <%linSP> yeah if youre super far that happens
[1:19:15] <+redyoshi5> that is kinda new it has a new animation but that happens when you are to far from the sun for it to kill  you
[1:19:15] <jorniev> MAYBE YOUR CIVILIZATION CAN LIVE HERE!?
[1:19:16] <%skizzuto> the explosion hit the twins I assume, which is why you got pulled back
[1:19:18] <%Frost_Quill> Wonder what happens if you remove ash twin project and then go there?  Will you still die?
[1:19:18] <Medo3G> they updated the animation
[1:19:19] <Louie_Salmon> That always happened, but the animation is new.
[1:19:20] <%derpy_platypus> New
[1:19:20] <+JPivot> the effect existed, but the vfx got updated yeah
[1:19:23] <hassanico2> OH so it kept drifting past the solar system?!
[1:19:25] <IHaveNoFunnyName> That's new but in the base game too. New animation for timing out of the loop, like if you just run away
[1:19:26] <CrematedCube> The effect is different now
[1:19:32] <hassanico2> This thing ISN'T in Orbit?
[1:19:35] <%derpy_platypus> HINT HINT
[1:19:36] <egressanon> the real question is what happens if you disable ash twin and then get in the dlc zone
[1:19:36] <AzureGale> Nani?
[1:19:37] <%linSP> so you dont have to go to the satellite every time
[1:19:46] <%baka_sugoi> ORB it
[1:19:47] <leole11> wink wink nudge nudge
[1:19:51] <FleshFriend> wink wink
[1:19:54] <%Faustgesicht> Ah I was wondering how they were gonna handle that
[1:19:56] <AMERICA_YEA> LUL
[1:20:03] <hewwogames> you had a look on your face
[1:20:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> @hassanico2 or just a really far one
[1:20:04] <stoatacious> wink wink

[1:25:43] <%Valdorick> Its this place, before the flood destroys it.
[1:25:44] <HiveMasterMind> Did the owls turn themselves into light?
[1:25:50] <%DrTomT18> you already looked in this building
[1:25:52] <genmypoweralready> Missed the start is this pre or post campfire galaxy explosion
[1:26:01] <ZE_Count> explore pat
[1:26:04] <%Mattais88> House across the river?
[1:26:07] <AoiRob> i mean theres plenty more buildings to check
[1:26:08] <vVAstrAVv> might wanna check the glowey building
[1:26:08] <TheRealNumberJ42> the owls turned themselves into pickles funniest shit ive ever seen
[1:26:10] <$Futurecity10> @genmypoweralready He's already beaten the game
[1:26:10] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Or you could throw one of those on a raft and take it with you, incase the thing breaks
[1:26:14] <%A_Zealous_Retort> did one fall through the holes in the ground?
[1:26:22] <+Delenay> might be on the other side
[1:26:25] <%MelBrooksKA> @genmypoweralready both
[1:26:25] <stoatacious> pat.
[1:26:29] <%asgard147> across the bridge maybee?
[1:26:30] <CrematedCube> @genmypoweralready before the supernova
[1:26:30] <genmypoweralready> I know he did, but the DLC i mean
[1:26:32] <genmypoweralready> oh
[1:26:34] <LittleBigQuebec> maybe one of the other buildings?
[1:26:35] <%kyh9> Maybe a different building?
[1:26:42] <%Monkeyweed21> other buildings
[1:26:47] <%rekinom> Many different herrings
[1:26:52] <leole11> broken ;(
[1:26:56] <ZE_Count> theres alot of buildings
[1:26:59] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Red Herring? We talking about A Pup named Scooby Doo?
[1:27:02] <AoiRob> borken
[1:27:05] <ChungusQuest> sucks light in
[1:27:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> mystery solved
[1:27:07] <%KoiRedd> Broken Herring :(
[1:27:08] <teh_Question> but green are there rings in this game??
[1:27:12] <%DrTomT18> Broken latern confirmed to be broken
[1:27:14] <%baka_sugoi> fix it
[1:27:14] <+Thickiequicks> lan-Tarn
[1:27:16] <+Ultimate_Edge> Poor broken lantern
[1:27:17] <AoiRob> check the building past the bridge
[1:27:18] <%derpy_platypus> now find good lantern
[1:27:22] <leole11> dw lol
[1:27:22] <+Yamchadassist> this prolly a 2 streamer
[1:27:22] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Take a reel with you! Incase it floods so you can use it at the later one!
[1:27:26] <%Dakuu75> you passed a working lantern on a table somewhere
[1:27:28] <nomos42> yeah it's a doosy
[1:27:28] <pth88> this dlc makes me feel like a big dummy so far
[1:27:30] <Zhwoobatte> that's the idea
[1:27:31] <cureneckbeard> Pat Solves At
[1:27:31] <%Valdorick> Ah, the tutorial Lantern, that teaches you that lanterns exist.
[1:27:33] <%BinaryFireball> dude the base game was arcane as shit
[1:27:35] <Go4theKnees> this dlc is biiig
[1:27:36] <%Faustgesicht> what if shine light at lantern?
[1:27:38] <tanarath> pat brain challenged
[1:27:44] <vVAstrAVv> it took me maaaaaaany cycles
[1:27:46] <%kyh9> Pay REFUSES TO cross that bridge
[1:27:47] <genmypoweralready> Pat Will Figure It Out
[1:27:50] <captain_kirkhammer> You just don't have the axioms yet
[1:27:53] <IHaveNoFunnyName> just waiting for the dam to break again
[1:27:54] <%ctk96> dam check
[1:27:56] <leole11> happy little trees, happy little bridge
[1:27:57] <Edsta94> @PatStaresAt you're a bit off about that i reckon, keep playing and the peices will fit together
[1:28:00] <Teras_ode> that looks sturdy :)
[1:28:07] <+Ultimate_Edge> With time loops you have all the time in the world
[1:28:11] <tanarath> 20 minutes
[1:28:14] <%derpy_platypus> Lantern friend
[1:28:14] <vvastrel> This DLC was easier than the base game because it's all on the same "planet"
[1:28:18] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder if you can get high enough that you don't get swept away.
[1:28:18] <%DrTomT18> Do not go in the water
[1:28:21] <%ElkRiverDog> Lantern!
[1:28:22] <vVAstrAVv> blind
[1:28:24] <%ctk96> thats alot of lanterns
[1:28:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> a horde of lanterns
[1:28:27] <vVAstrAVv> or not
[1:28:28] <cureneckbeard> haruka
[1:28:29] <%baka_sugoi> PLANET
[1:28:31] <%derpy_platypus> Think about wife
[1:28:33] <+JPivot> had to do it to him
[1:28:36] <+malacante> I just had to think of every river subsection as a planet and that helped
[1:28:37] <leole11> cute :)
[1:28:39] <cureneckbeard> It's not a cult! haruchiHueggly
[1:28:39] <%baka_sugoi> chuk it
[1:28:40] <cholesteroid> ride wife
[1:28:40] <+Like51bears> TIME TO LEARN
[1:28:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> theres a lantern dragon nearby
[1:28:40] <%linSP> ringed planet
[1:28:40] <%Valdorick> A journey... of boating.
[1:28:41] <jorniev> RAFTING TO SPACE
[1:28:43] <%Dakuu75> these aliens seem cool
[1:28:46] <%asgard147> it's fine
[1:28:48] <+Ultimate_Edge> Green Saturn is cool
[1:28:48] <+Thickiequicks> with haste
[1:28:52] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Maybe grab a reel?
[1:28:55] <%Agami23> this place seems like it would be fun to chill whenever the dam isnt broken
[1:29:00] <%lumporr> is this the Deathloops?
[1:29:01] <crazypieman7> @malacante heavily recommend this approach
[1:29:01] <$ringabal> Think about Boat
[1:29:07] <+Mr_Misanthropy> Nothing makes me want to go river rafting more than lookin at a planet.

[1:33:54] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Top right
[1:33:56] <+JustToWatch> an artifact, says it right on the box
[1:33:56] <+Yamchadassist> translator??

[1:34:01] <vVAstrAVv> its important
[1:34:01] <iosephe> An artifact
[1:34:02] <%Dopamien> @Shwepie if I actually think about it, its still more energy to rotate the ring and keep it moving. Friction from the water would slow it down
[1:34:05] <Shwepie> Looks like one of the billion symbols we saw.
[1:34:05] <%Valdorick> Good timing

[1:48:41] <%Mattais88> @Nordguy Nah that takes to long. he just swallows it. Like a duck.
[1:48:44] <%DrTomT18> I never did find out what happens if you take an artifact back to Hornfells
[1:48:48] <%linSP> but how
[1:48:50] <leole11> big think time
[1:48:51] <Abyssal_Jaguar> DOES IT CAPTURE DARK!?
[1:48:55] <%derpy_platypus> conceal to hide?!
[1:48:57] <leole11> but HOW
[1:48:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> it really seems like a lantern should go in there
[1:48:57] <%baka_sugoi> light?
[1:48:59] <%asgard147> maybe you need the artifact for that door you found before the sun blew up?
[1:49:00] <TheRealNumberJ42> took me forever to notice that lmao
[1:49:03] <%skizzuto> seems like you gotta combine it with something?
[1:49:06] <RyuuAoi> Put your dick in there!
[1:49:07] <waltzqueen> HUH
[1:49:11] <%Ne1son> Now pick up lantern
[1:49:13] <%A_Zealous_Retort> do you keep it through loops?
[1:49:26] <+Delenay> this was in one of the slides
[1:49:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> right now it's just an ASMR device
[1:49:32] <%Valdorick> wait..... can you put a lamp in it?
[1:49:32] <%A_Zealous_Retort> its a laser?
[1:49:35] <+Delenay> that thingy
[1:49:35] <harmless_toast> it sure does seem artifacty
[1:49:36] <NeroInfinite> now put your pp in it
[1:49:36] <DianaTheAscian> hmmm
[1:49:39] <leole11> big thinky time
[1:49:45] <Abyssal_Jaguar> catches dark?
[1:49:46] <%Frost_Quill> maybe you put the lantern in it?  i genuinely don't know.
[1:49:47] <%DrTomT18> Pat, theres a cool looking builder to your left
[1:49:55] <56Bagels> you have tons of oxygen tho you're fine
[1:49:57] <%hewlettfan96> whats going on
[1:49:57] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[1:49:57] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 50m.
[1:50:06] <ChungusQuest> It sure looks like you do a very specific thing with that artifact
[1:50:06] <leole11> it is a mystery
[1:50:11] <%SirGO0SE> that's a vargCBT
[1:50:13] <%derpy_platypus> no more lantern
[1:50:23] <%linSP> gotta find one
[1:50:24] <AoiRob> but no lantorn
[1:50:24] <%A_Zealous_Retort> behind the screen
[1:50:27] <vVAstrAVv> @56bagels oxygens way worse propellant than fuel
[1:50:48] <waltzqueen> big talk for someone who needs to breathe
[1:50:48] <Medo3G> that's a strong statement
[1:50:51] <%linSP> all my homies hate oxygen
[1:50:52] <ChungusQuest> That's what I always say when I play FTL
[1:50:52] <+Delenay> trick seems to be to get lantern and speed run to the next slide
[1:50:55] <DianaTheAscian> no fuel
[1:50:58] <IHaveNoFunnyName> wait do the jets produce light even when on oxygen? nice
[1:50:58] <crazypieman7> can't you just go get the lantern from the tower?
[1:50:59] <AoiRob> check that building i guess
[1:51:02] <leole11> that is convenient
[1:51:04] <56Bagels> @vVAstrAVv yeah but in most other parts of the game no fuel = dead pretty damn soon

[1:57:02] <+Moy_Luna> I actually don't know what happened. I just poped in to say that. Pretty happy with the result.
[1:57:02] <$ringabal> Well, you ARE on a computer log
[1:57:13] <%KoiRedd> True

[2:01:58] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the water rises when the dam breaks

[2:05:03] <Medo3G> that explains it
[2:05:04] <%Valdorick> Oh thats why they burned the slides
[2:05:10] <%linSP> we know what the eye does at the end of the base game
[2:05:10] <leole11> cool, half the story is MISSING
[2:05:10] <ChungusQuest> oh so that's why some of the slides are fucked
[2:05:14] <%dekkitout> They stared at the abyss and flinched- pussies...
[2:05:16] <HiveMasterMind> their goal is to kill the eye wow
[2:05:19] <%RealThiele> [Hyperlink Blocked]
[2:05:27] <+Delenay> that artifact you can grab is in that pic, it holds a flame?
[2:05:29] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Is the bottom symbol on the first slide the artifact?
[2:05:31] <ZilverZap> Turns out worshipping anything from space is a bad idea
[2:05:33] <%strakillias> Wait did they make the eye blow up the universe?
[2:05:34] <%Valdorick> Owls will attack and dethrone god.
[2:05:36] <mr_saturday93> died because of ghost matter?
[2:05:44] <Go4theKnees> they were like yo heat death is not okay
[2:05:50] <AoiRob> they like sealed dracula or smth
[2:05:51] <%KoiRedd> Mistakes were made by the space Owl people
[2:05:53] <HiveMasterMind> OH they saw that touching the eye causes the universe reset & hated that
[2:05:53] <$ringabal> no
[2:06:00] <harmless_toast> SpooOOoOOoOOooky
[2:06:01] <%Valdorick> No, the Eye was god, it remakes the universe.
[2:06:04] <leole11> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[2:06:06] <%Ne1son> Sacrificed themselfes to seal it
[2:06:08] <ZilverZap> man these things are fucking creepy
[2:06:10] <jubejube56> My guess is they know that the eye sorta is related to destroying and remaking the universe and they are@against that
[2:06:15] <%KoiRedd> The Night Mother is in there
[2:06:17] <+BloodyBurney> can't believe the chills this game gives me omg
[2:06:18] <%derpy_platypus> bork
[2:06:20] <+Delenay> the artifact captures the flame that you then put in there
[2:06:22] <+redthebaron> real eldritch vibes
[2:06:26] <Louie_Salmon> Three masks, to seal the... hollow knight?
[2:06:27] <%asgard147> "FEED ME!" psaDogchamp
[2:06:30] <%RealThiele> gief hate light puzzle
[2:06:31] <%A_Zealous_Retort> how are you normally supposed to get to the top of the tower
[2:06:32] <+twohitgood> so what causes the dam to break?
[2:06:34] <%DrTomT18> My theory is that the eye told them what was going to happen to the universe and they said 'no fuck you'
[2:06:36] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Didn't go in new building?
[2:06:40] <+twohitgood> is there a way to stop the dam from breaking?
[2:06:47] <%asgard147> Then be quick limesOwo
[2:06:50] <Visorak6> So they're making the argument that destroying the eye is the better call?
[2:06:50] <%Monkeyweed21> stairs
[2:07:00] <chaosbringer28> shoot a scout at the damn when you get the chance
[2:07:04] <leole11> @DrTomT18 my theory is that they didn't understand what the eye tried to tell them, they assume it was destruction
[2:07:04] <$ringabal> Space Owls do NOT like to let it set in.
[2:07:05] <AoiRob> you missed a bulding
[2:07:06] <%Agami23> some way from the inside im guessing. something needs to be lit af
[2:07:07] <+Delenay> is there a hole on that one side
[2:07:10] <%Valdorick> "The pope lied to us, kill 'em"
[2:07:10] <%Monkeyweed21> use the stairs?
[2:07:12] <%kraken_lab> Oh and you can use their flamethrower fuel for jetpack fuel
[2:07:16] <waltzqueen> @Visorak6 they probably dont have to worry about unstable stars like the nomai do
[2:07:18] <+Delenay> in the rock the tower is against
[2:07:20] <iosephe> missed
[2:07:21] <+ReallyBigRocks> almost got it
[2:07:24] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah that might be too far
[2:07:24] <%KoiRedd> Maybe it's a cell... From the Prison of Elders! The Archon Priest might still be inside!
[2:07:26] <chaosbringer28> gotta land it on the dam, make the shot
[2:07:26] <Medo3G> structural integrity I guess?
[2:07:27] <Abyssal_Jaguar> WAIT FIRE IT STRAIGHT UP
[2:07:33] <%A_Zealous_Retort> is that a cave at the waterline to the right of the tower?
[2:07:34] <Abyssal_Jaguar> WHAT DOES GRAVITY DO ON A RING WORLD?
[2:07:35] <AoiRob> well its not gonna hit from there
[2:07:39] <%Monkeyweed21> gravity too strong @Abyssal_Jaguar
[2:07:42] <Minorou> it might gravity its way over
[2:07:48] <%RetroCop87> The eyeball turned them into Canadiens fans after a game
[2:07:49] <jorniev> oposite direction?
[2:07:51] <Go4theKnees> the structure is rotating

[2:08:46] <%strakillias> Wait were those evil looking owls in the slides actually them turning into ghosts
[2:08:48] <$Futurecity10> Maybe the dam breaks because it has too much energy stored?
[2:08:48] <waltzqueen> @kazadaz have fun
[2:08:52] <+MrBotchamania> No spoilers guys
[2:08:54] <%Bluwizard21> beware the flood

[2:15:32] <%baka_sugoi> S L E E P
[2:15:33] <leole11> pat, the dam breaks half way through the loop
[2:15:33] <%tank7013> So does the weird item artifact not carry over loops?
[2:15:35] <HiveMasterMind> keep expolring
[2:15:35] <DianaTheAscian> hope you found everything
[2:15:38] <AluxStreams> I found that room completely by accident. lol
[2:15:38] <AoiRob> grab the thing and go!
[2:15:39] <%Frost_Quill> Do you remember where the artifact was?  i don't.
[2:15:41] <%derpy_platypus> big death
[2:15:45] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Wasn't there a closer one of those rooms, like in the first area?
[2:15:51] <ZilverZap> kmaDead
[2:15:53] <Visorak6> Artifact is in the ghost matter shack
[2:15:53] <%drabberfaun535> i wonder if their is a thing in the water behind the dam
[2:15:55] <vVAstrAVv> the flood isnt the end pat
[2:15:58] <AoiRob> it was in the ghost matter bulding
[2:16:16] <leole11> ah fair
[2:16:21] <DianaTheAscian> its the end of that puzle
[2:16:22] <%crashzilla_> The flood is like 2/3, maybe a little less
[2:16:23] <%baka_sugoi> too much water
[2:16:27] <DianaTheAscian> puzzle*
[2:16:32] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dont forget the space suit
[2:16:34] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Oh I meant another room full of lanturns
[2:16:37] <%Frost_Quill> wonder what happens if you just fly at the stranger as fast as you can
[2:16:37] <leole11> he might get to the THING
[2:16:37] <Medo3G> I don't like these owl guys
[2:16:39] <cheapdoc> @baka_sugoi 7/10
[2:16:43] <%kraken_lab> Man seeing their fucking bare bones was spooky
[2:16:48] <vVAstrAVv> chats being one guy about the artifact
[2:16:49] <%Monkeyweed21> the dam breaks at about 60 %
[2:16:53] <Louie_Salmon> Yup, it kills the speed anyway.
[2:16:55] <%kraken_lab> The nomai were all in their suits
[2:17:01] <+emperri> rotating is a neat trick
[2:17:03] <%ctk96> speeeeeed
[2:17:06] <%kraken_lab> These guys are bare
[2:17:07] <%asgard147> what about that door you found before the sun blew up? it had a picture of the artifact on it I think limesThink
[2:17:09] <chaosbringer28> dont forget shoot dam
[2:17:10] <%crashzilla_> I didn't know you could rotate the ship
[2:17:11] <+extantCadence> Yeah, it's one of those things where it just resets your speed
[2:17:11] <AoiRob> oh it cancels your acceleration
[2:17:14] <+redyoshi5> ya its like that cause you will be have to make that flight a lot
[2:17:14] <%ctk96> he's learning
[2:17:17] <%thedankestmeeme> wait pat which story is better breaking the loop, or protecting it?
[2:17:17] <mr_saturday93> @kraken_lab I'm sure if Paige saw them she be wet
[2:17:18] <biggswedg3> ooo just beat this a little while ago, had a great time
[2:17:20] <jorniev> PAT seems really good at this type of games
[2:17:22] <mrapplebucks> speed
[2:17:26] <%crashzilla_> I parked it upside down every single time
[2:17:30] <AoiRob> time for artifact
[2:17:32] <jorniev> IS this an inmersive sim?
[2:17:38] <DianaTheAscian> ghost
[2:17:49] <leole11> good question, is this an immersive sim?
[2:17:54] <%KoiRedd> @jorniev Probably somehow
[2:18:01] <+Yamchadassist> this has to be an immersive sim
[2:18:02] <+emperri> are you immersed
[2:18:06] <ZilverZap> This is more of an adventure game
[2:18:06] <biggswedg3> its an archeology game
[2:18:08] <+Delenay> theres on on the other side of town
[2:18:08] <cheapdoc> It feels like an immersive sim
[2:18:10] <%Monkeyweed21> LUL
[2:18:10] <%Valdorick> Boatless.
[2:18:11] <akitanito> you fool
[2:18:12] <Louie_Salmon> It's not NOT an immersive sim.
[2:18:13] <nomos42> nah, just puzzle
[2:18:14] <Visorak6> Hopefully completing the ritual gives you the cipher or something
[2:18:15] <%KoiRedd> Im definitely simmed
[2:18:16] <leole11> i'm pretty immersed, especially when i fall off the raft
[2:18:17] <+Delenay> go down river
[2:18:22] <crazypieman7> isn't there the same structure in this area too?
[2:18:26] <vVAstrAVv> theres a room here
[2:18:29] <Shwepie> Not an immersive sim, you don't punch 0451 into a keypad at the start.
[2:18:29] <nomos42> there's no alternative play styles
[2:18:29] <%Valdorick> This is a walking sim, which is LIKE an immersive sim.
[2:18:35] <vVAstrAVv> green light
[2:18:35] <crazypieman7> with the different pictures on the wall
[2:18:40] <TheRealNumberJ42> wtf is an immersive sim
[2:18:43] <+Delenay> your gunna need to keep that flame from the water i bet
[2:18:43] <$ringabal> Think about Raft
[2:18:44] <+Yamchadassist> @Shwepie solved
[2:18:51] <%DrTomT18> this is an exploration game
[2:18:54] <AoiRob> to da tower
[2:18:59] <leole11> @TheRealNumberJ42 deus ex, prey (the new one), etc
[2:19:00] <+Delenay> raft on right now
[2:19:02] <%dekkitout> Space ghosts, duh
[2:19:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> im sure the creepy ghost fire is totally harmless
[2:19:12] <%drabberfaun535> whether or not this is an immersive sim is dependent on its sales
[2:19:14] <TheRealNumberJ42> wtf no they aren't
[2:19:15] <%crashzilla_> It's spooky, I can guarantee you
[2:19:17] <+tomdwarf> Oh dear, this is in NO WAY an immersive sim.
[2:19:19] <%KoiRedd> Immersive sim isn't a genre... It's a lifestyle psaUp
[2:19:20] <AoiRob> magic demons obviously
[2:19:21] <KasiCrafter> Rime travel? I sleep. Ghost business? REEL SHYT
[2:19:23] <%derpy_platypus> they look scary af tho
[2:19:25] <KasiCrafter> *Time
[2:19:26] <+Delenay> maybe they had complaints about the fish and they are covering now
[2:19:26] <cheapdoc> Chinese antler ghost base
[2:19:28] <CatsDrunkonCopper> get ready for spooks
[2:19:30] <vVAstrAVv> its just some mummys
[2:19:30] <HiveMasterMind> Best bet on spooky ghost shit is wide mouthed hell owl ghost
[2:19:30] <%Faustgesicht> Like the owls going all green-eyed
[2:19:34] <Medo3G> flashbacks to remerai's jumpscare warning
[2:19:35] <%strakillias> Obviously they turned themselves in to ghost to do something..??
[2:19:38] <Visorak6> secret entrance right?
[2:19:38] <%ape_hawk> MYSTery
[2:19:39] <%Axellogic> Exploration mystery
[2:19:40] <ExpressNode> Man my Switch controllers take a long ass time to update
[2:19:41] <leole11> mystery game WOULD make sense
[2:19:42] <%DrTomT18> and a puzzle game
[2:19:42] <%Mattais88> Modern day Myst
[2:19:43] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Walking Sim with JRPG elements
[2:19:45] <nomos42> this is mind fuck game
[2:19:49] <%Valdorick> Its Genre? Its a Video Game Kappa
[2:19:50] <ChungusQuest> Cool dudes, they love space travel and hailing the Necroflame like any of us
[2:19:52] <%Hiro01231> Hiro01231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months! 
[2:19:53] <+emperri> I feel like time loop game puzzle is becoming a genre
[2:19:55] <Saltmeisterr> its clearly a deathloop
[2:19:56] <jorniev> maybe they turned themselves into gohsts
[2:19:58] <Louie_Salmon> But it does take place on a set schedule, with mechanics that work as naturally as possible.
[2:19:58] <%kraken_lab> Exploration/mystery
[2:20:06] <raikagelord1> Owls are spooky in general.
[2:20:15] <%bevyrage> i think pat needs to stop meditating until the next loop when he meets a mild impass.
[2:20:15] <cheapdoc> puzzle game too

[2:23:57] <%derpy_platypus> don't trip or you'll end the run
[2:24:01] <+embranz> a lot of you think you’re sneaky trying to act like you’re not spoiling the puzzle lol
[2:24:03] <%TheWinged7> oh no pats aussie accent is leaking again
[2:24:06] <iosephe> it just does
[2:24:08] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Raft-kun
[2:24:09] <Louie_Salmon> Pretty sure it's just percent
[2:24:09] <harmless_toast> You can see your health in the figure in the top left. The more red, the closer to dead
[2:24:12] <%Mattais88> Time to break the damn damn
[2:24:15] <%DrTomT18> there is a health point system but it does not tell you how many points you have
[2:24:17] <+JPivot> you heal by eating nonburned marshmallows. its like that in the basegame too
[2:24:20] <+Like51bears> its the red outline on the figure next to your fuel
[2:24:21] <nomos42> it's mainly just eating marshmellows to heal
[2:24:23] <BakaTyler> you eat marshmallow to get big health. that how health work
[2:24:23] <ZE_Count> all red means dead
[2:24:30] <heartlesshealer> suit health, body health, oxygen, fuel. You only have a HUD for two
[2:24:34] <56Bagels> you can bandage up in the ship if you really need to, or eat shmallows
[2:24:34] <%derpy_platypus> doesn't that happen in real life tho?
[2:24:37] <harmless_toast> @PatStaresAt your health is shown by the figure in the top left. The more red it is the closer you are to dead
[2:24:37] <leole11> the solar panels :)
[2:24:38] <+twohitgood> was it because they were submerged?
[2:24:38] <+MrBotchamania> Eating marshmallows restores health
[2:24:40] <heartlesshealer> I mean 3
[2:24:43] <bear_breaker20> nice
[2:24:46] <+emperri> I've never played this and I have no idea what he's supposed to do, so the spoilers aren't spoiling that much and maybe some people need to calm down
[2:24:47] <vVAstrAVv> hold up eating marshmellows actually heals you?
[2:24:48] <%crashzilla_> Top left is your health, the more red your silhouette is the less health you have
[2:24:49] <%G_Thunders> I’ve seen two other streamers do that fire part and both had chat answer for them. Pat chat is best
[2:24:49] <Louie_Salmon> Or off? Definitely an electrical thing happens
[2:24:54] <vVAstrAVv> how much?
[2:25:01] <%KoiRedd> @embranz If he doesn't know, he doesn't know. Chat behaved pretty well psaUp
[2:25:05] <+Delenay> theres a hole in that wall with a door way the f up there
[2:25:14] <harmless_toast> @heartlesshealer suit health isn't a thing, and body health is shown in the figure in the top left with everything else
[2:25:14] <+twohitgood> pre-flood is my favorite they might be giants.
[2:25:14] <ChungusQuest> A perfect golden-brown marshmallow is a full heal
[2:25:15] <+Delenay> ah nbm
[2:25:15] <+kingmemelord97> !uptime
[2:25:15] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 25m.
[2:25:19] <%derpy_platypus> try a jump attack?
[2:25:29] <+embranz> @emperri as someone who HAS played this like 10 chatters we’re trying to sneaky spoil stuff for Pat and not get caught
[2:25:30] <%Frost_Quill> I mostly just saw people guessing.
[2:25:31] <ChungusQuest> there are NO indicators of what makes it perfect golden-brown
[2:25:33] <nomos42> @emperri nah, some people are hinting in a way that could kind of sequence break thins
[2:25:33] <crazypieman7> @PatStaresAt remember to shoot the dam with the scout next loop
[2:25:34] <nilla_24> @PatStaresAt the windows maybe? the green one
[2:25:36] <+tomdwarf> You could potentially get across once the dam breaks
[2:25:39] <%Mattais88> Maybe you can ride the flood wave?
[2:25:50] <%A_Zealous_Retort> all the houses upstream get washed there?
[2:25:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Imagine if the big upgrade is figuring out how to get your ship inside
[2:25:55] <$dalmek> broat
[2:25:57] <+Delenay> yo, ride the wave and jump?
[2:26:02] <vVAstrAVv> @emperri the thing is with this game you can do everything if you know WHAT to do. so a spoiler can just be done now and kills the mystery
[2:26:03] <+BIumen> pat get the banana
[2:26:16] <OzzySnek> :D!!!! I am so glad to see Pat doing this!
[2:26:16] <+emperri> freaking out that something is a spoiler is as much of a spoiler as obliquely hinting at something
[2:26:23] <+emperri> chill
[2:26:29] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Probe at dam? See if something is down there on our side?
[2:26:40] <%KoiRedd> @emperri Agreed
[2:26:45] <+Delenay> power lines
[2:26:47] <%Valdorick> This is some MC Escher shit
[2:27:07] <WhiteZerko> I love the idea of a dam creating a lake in a ringworld. It's so fucking cool.
[2:27:14] <iosephe> maybe
[2:27:24] <%Valdorick> Raw raw, fight the power cord.
[2:27:28] <+embranz> @emperri with all due respect you have no idea how this game works or what you’re talking about, chatters we’re trying to get Pat to skip poke 3 hours or content by giving him the answers outright
[2:27:30] <leole11> oooooo what is that
[2:27:34] <%Bluwizard21> whelp time to sleep so I can go to work at 5 am
[2:27:41] <ChungusQuest> is that a PUZZLE SOLUTION!?
[2:27:42] <Visorak6> thats the code?
[2:27:43] <HiveMasterMind> Theory: The symbol above the combo lock a laser to destroy the eye of the universe
[2:27:45] <thehornypastrypuffer> pat get the banana
[2:27:46] <%thedankestmeeme> was the power source stolen?
[2:27:48] <TheRealNumberJ42> galaxy brain time
[2:27:49] <%Valdorick> Ah
[2:27:49] <DianaTheAscian> the combination
[2:27:51] <leole11> YES YES YES
[2:27:54] <%Frost_Quill> sun - fire - fire
[2:28:00] <harmless_toast> sun, sideways, fire, sideways, fire
[2:28:06] <Zhwoobatte> i didn't even know you could shoot a scout in here and see this lol
[2:28:09] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt sun eye fire eye fire
[2:28:09] <leole11> smart pat
[2:28:13] <56Bagels> lol this bit took me way too long to find I'm so ashamed, even went in the building and then left
[2:28:15] <%derpy_platypus> fire-sideways-star
[2:28:27] <%KoiRedd> @embranz Nobody was spoiled tho and none of us know anything more, including Pat
[2:28:29] <harmless_toast> zoeyNail
[2:28:30] <chaosbringer28> i think that was different than my game, so that is randomized
[2:28:34] <+Delenay> the helm
[2:28:38] <%Valdorick> Oh, Navigation?
[2:28:39] <%strakillias> Maybe the power to this door is what turned on
[2:28:40] <+Delenay> they drove here
[2:28:40] <AoiRob> borken
[2:28:48] <vVAstrAVv> @embranz theyre dunning Kruger effect personified lol
[2:28:59] <%SirGO0SE> cool table
[2:29:03] <DianaTheAscian> the station
[2:29:10] <%Valdorick> They have... a tug in front of the ship?
[2:29:13] <+Delenay> is there a bit they launched away
[2:29:13] <%A_Zealous_Retort> controller thing in other room is broken which is misaligning laser things from the tower?
[2:29:18] <%Frost_Quill> That's the station?
[2:29:18] <AoiRob> sumthin
[2:29:18] <jorniev> is it a space ship?
[2:29:20] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh.. is it possible that's the busted wheel behind you?
[2:29:21] <vVAstrAVv> dam bam thank you maam
[2:29:21] <%DrTomT18> I think this is some kind of retrieval system for the Ring World, but I'm not sure
[2:29:22] <%Agami23> i think the big thing is the stranger
[2:29:25] <+Delenay> you just saw it, the helms gone
[2:29:26] <leole11> that's probably where you are
[2:29:26] <+emperri> @embranz if you don't know the solution, then 1 person suggesting something is no different than another until the hall monitors start pitching a fit about a specific suggestion
[2:29:28] <+embranz> @KoiRedd only because Pat didn’t see the comments or chose to ignore them, but truet me they were basically giving him an answer he hasn’t seen yet. Just take it from someone who’s already beaten this lol.
[2:29:29] <%VHGS> something is fucked up
[2:29:29] <$ringabal> "Your internet is not available."
[2:29:29] <+Delenay> last room
[2:29:30] <%Mattais88> Is this a colony laser?
[2:29:31] <%strakillias> This is the control room for the lasers at a DethKlok concert
[2:29:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> is that where you are?
[2:29:32] <Visorak6> Those are the same spines on the tower right?
[2:29:33] <+CookieCutter007> is that the scanner ?
[2:29:37] <%crashzilla_> The control panel in the other room?
[2:29:39] <+Yamchadassist> ooo the stranger launched a probe
[2:29:39] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt the thing is broken so no signal?
[2:29:39] <ChungusQuest> Piloting subsystem destroyed
[2:29:41] <spuginky> is goofed
[2:29:41] <Abyssal_Jaguar> No control, so something out side can't align?
[2:29:43] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the helm is trashed in that last room
[2:29:44] <%walternatorz> that's the broken
[2:29:45] <%DrTomT18> if the Eye destroyed their home world, they couldn't go home, right?
[2:29:45] <%Agami23> the stranger wants to get a squid but there is no squid
[2:29:46] <+drflatface> drflatface subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! never seen this game in action before, is it good?
[2:29:50] <%crashzilla_> YEAP
[2:29:53] <%Ne1son> Lol
[2:29:54] <Teras_ode> dusted
[2:29:54] <FleshFriend> all burnt up
[2:29:56] <%tank7013> Maybe that electrical thing is something in here overloading?
[2:29:56] <ZilverZap> just a lil broken
[2:30:06] <%dekkitout> Shit's fucked?
[2:30:09] <%heyitsbrian> @drflatface Yes!  It's very good.
[2:30:10] <ChungusQuest> I love their pixel windows
[2:30:11] <crazypieman7> oh wow I didn't notice the first time that they did it intentionally with that flamethrower
[2:30:19] <%Frost_Quill> Wonder if the quantum moon can orbit this thing.
[2:30:22] <leole11> the BELL
[2:30:22] <hewwogames> diving bell moments
[2:30:25] <DianaTheAscian> explains a lot
[2:30:26] <waltzqueen> thaAAaares
[2:30:28] <+embranz> @emberri just take the L dude lol, trust me when I say that a bunch of chatters were trying to be sneaky by giving Pat the answer by pretending they were just guessing. A lot of us who have played it caught on to it.
[2:30:28] <%Valdorick> ayyyyyyyye
[2:30:30] <%dekkitout> Don't forget to ring dat bell
[2:30:33] <%Frost_Quill> So what actually caused the dam to break?
[2:30:34] <+Delenay> lol
[2:30:34] <%VHGS> lol
[2:30:34] <%DrTomT18> AHAHA

[2:32:19] <Abyssal_Jaguar> There is a lantern room in the first set of buildings, want to see if that trick works there too?
[2:32:19] <vVAstrAVv> @emperri bruh stop. its over and you dont know shit. weve moved on without you
[2:32:49] <%chiazam> Still haven’t figured out how to read tho
[2:32:54] <+emperri> @vVAstrAVv bruh if pat needed you to be a mod you'd be one. check yourself
[2:33:07] <+embranz> @emperri everyone who’s already played this game caught on to the spoilers chat was trying to give Pat lol. You haven’t played it, you’ve got no room to talk and now everyone else is calling you out.
[2:33:09] <%Valdorick> Become a reservoir... dog.
[2:33:10] <+kingmemelord97> man pat must have the patience of a saint i couldnt keep doing this over and over again
[2:33:11] <$ringabal> SIR
[2:33:14] <cheapdoc> Chase it
[2:33:15] <nomos42> the probe
[2:33:15] <ZE_Count> the shot
[2:33:18] <%DrTomT18> Thats the Probe that launches at the start of every loop
[2:33:19] <vvastrel> it's the probe
[2:33:21] <+Like51bears> just the probe
[2:33:22] <biggswedg3> the probe
[2:33:23] <harmless_toast> that's the probe that the cannon fires at the start of every loop
[2:33:25] <iosephe> probe?
[2:33:26] <+Nahual_Amini> I believe is the probe
[2:33:28] <%Frost_Quill> The probe?
[2:33:28] <buhbuhboat> orbital probe
[2:33:29] <blastazoid00> This game got an update?!
[2:33:29] <Go4theKnees> thats the OG nomai probe
[2:33:29] <chaosbringer28> thats the probe from the cannon
[2:33:32] <AoiRob> the nomai probe
[2:33:34] <WhiteZerko> That's the probe, from the Nomai. Base game.
[2:33:36] <+embranz> Anyway this conversation is done no reason to spam Pat’s chat with it
[2:33:37] <%DrTomT18> you don't get anything for chasing it.
[2:33:42] <+redyoshi5> ya thats the probe the nomai shot
[2:33:48] <+emperri> @embranz not a spoiler if you need to have beaten the game to catch it
[2:33:48] <%Monkeyweed21> no the probe is red light
[2:33:49] <$dalmek> @blastazoid00 DLC (released yesterday) and also a patch
[2:33:49] <vVAstrAVv> @emperri go have a wank
[2:33:52] <thehornypastrypuffer> ahahah
[2:33:57] <%Monkeyweed21> oh wait the cannon probe
[2:33:57] <harmless_toast> @buhbuhboat it got a huge DLC, leave now if you don't want spoilers!
[2:33:58] <%derpy_platypus> keep on keeping on
[2:34:02] <Virokwet> what a landing
[2:34:03] <crazypieman7> "bro why are you getting mad about theses spoilers bro, no one can even tell these are spoilers bro" - man who hasn't played the game people are spoiling
[2:34:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> @Monkeyweed21 Thats the satellite
[2:34:27] <%DrTomT18> hey Pat, look up
[2:34:33] <%KoiRedd> @vVAstrAVv If he's not British he might not get that lol
[2:34:54] <blastazoid00> This is Halo infinite LUL
[2:34:54] <%Monkeyweed21> wait so is the Stranger tailing the nomai probe in order to find the Eye?
[2:34:54] <cheapdoc> Still wondering how that artifact works
[2:34:55] <Ariddic> neat, its like Sigil
[2:34:56] <TheRealNumberJ42> you can see the gears turning
[2:34:59] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oh hey theres another village thing
[2:34:59] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[2:35:01] <+embranz> @emperri I don’t think you’re understanding it. It wasn’t a story spoilers, it was a spoiler of the puzzle that would have sequence broken the game and caused Pat to miss hours of progress and content. Basically skipping to the end.
[2:35:02] <AoiRob> oh
[2:35:04] <%Axellogic> Im curious about something if you would humor me. One steamer im watching makes me really naseous playing this but you dont. What FOV are your using
[2:35:16] <cureneckbeard> chat is like "I don't know if this is a spoiler, but"
[2:35:16] <+Like51bears> galaxy brain
[2:35:17] <AoiRob> lmao its the aerie form nier
[2:35:19] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oooohhh thats the other side of the broken bridge
[2:35:20] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Go ar right!
[2:35:23] <AoiRob> *from
[2:35:44] <+CookieCutter007> Starboard
[2:35:44] <%DrTomT18> hard to starboard! ... I think
[2:35:50] <cureneckbeard> :axellogic framerate maybe? 60fpx vs 24ps
[2:35:50] <%Valdorick> yar har fiddley dee
[2:35:53] <harmless_toast> @Axellogic is the other streamer using mouse+keyboard? you can turn a lot faster and more erratically with a mouse which can make some people motion sick
[2:35:55] <nomos42> love the raft music
[2:35:55] <EternalJedi> port is left
[2:35:56] <$ringabal> Left
[2:35:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> that way
[2:35:58] <%A_Zealous_Retort> port is left
[2:35:59] <+JPivot> port is left, starboard is right
[2:35:59] <hewwogames> starboard = right
[2:35:59] <nomos42> i forget
[2:35:59] <%akscully> port = left
[2:36:00] <%RonaldMcDownload> port=left
[2:36:00] <leole11> port is right
[2:36:01] <%greasypete00> port is left
[2:36:01] <%walternatorz> larboard and starboard
[2:36:01] <@Ranryu692> Port Left, Starboard Right
[2:36:01] <$dalmek> port is left, if I remember right, and starboard is right
[2:36:01] <+Lokibringer> Port's a wine
[2:36:02] <leole11> LMAO
[2:36:02] <ChungusQuest> Port left, starboard right
[2:36:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> port left, starboard right
[2:36:03] <crazypieman7> port is left starboard is right
[2:36:03] <+emperri> @embranz do you just lack the capacity to consider things from another perspective? guessing is a natural thing to do for a viewer and the only thing saying it's not a guess but a spoiler is you freaking out
[2:36:04] <%Mattais88> The one that isn'5t starboard
[2:36:04] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I think they are all starboard in space
[2:36:05] <iosephe> Larboard is left
[2:36:05] <%DrTomT18> I have no idea. The ship is a square so
[2:36:07] <EternalJedi> NO PAT
[2:36:08] <%ocelotshotfirst> Port is Left same letters
[2:36:09] <%Valdorick> You're in space, so every side is starboard
[2:36:10] <%Agami23> port deez nuts
[2:36:11] <EternalJedi> I DO NOT MEAN LARBOARD
[2:36:12] <%akscully> four letters in each

[2:36:13] <%valriot> Larboard LUL
[2:36:14] <%Monkeyweed21> Starboard and Larboard
[2:36:14] <%asgard147> you mean larboard and starboard? limesOwo
[2:36:16] <%ThomasOfTroy> Larboard makes it easier to remember imo
[2:36:18] <+Like51bears> you don't have a bow on your raft so you don't have one
[2:36:21] <AoiRob> to the right
[2:36:23] <%SveriSageAdvice> i was about to say lol

[2:36:30] <$dalmek> Lort and Port
[2:36:34] <%walternatorz> port area
[2:36:36] <+vaderxyz1970> Starbord means the side the sun is facing
[2:36:39] <ZE_Count> thats right
[2:36:40] <harmless_toast> "left area" but it's on the right...
[2:36:42] <AoiRob> mission comprete
[2:36:43] <+RelikaNox> I enter the chat to hear larboard and starboard and I did not need to be personally attacked like that
[2:36:43] <vVAstrAVv> good save pat
[2:36:44] <cureneckbeard> starboard is right though
[2:36:46] <+ReallyBigRocks> wait isn't this right?
[2:36:47] <+embranz> @enberri like I said, it’s a very specific way to solve it and chat was trying to be sneaky. A lot of people called them out. Just enjoy the stream lol I’m not wasting my time anymore.
[2:36:49] <%strakillias> Port is a good way to get drunk at a place that only serves wines
[2:36:54] <%Monkeyweed21> no this is starboard
[2:36:55] <vVAstrAVv> that was your right
[2:36:55] <$ringabal> AND in charge!

[2:39:46] <waltzqueen> SQUEAK
[2:39:49] <+tomdwarf> It looked like maybe the cloaking breaks? The triangle glass looks like it goes on/off.
[2:39:53] <%derpy_platypus> and the lights will flicker on and off.... oooooooooooo
[2:39:54] <%Frost_Quill> You've got a spacesuit on.

[2:45:10] <blastazoid00> Is there still a timer?
[2:45:14] <FleshFriend> i like how the nomai is all science, but these guys seem like they're using actual astral magic shit
[2:45:19] <+emperri> is this sun light? seems like soul light
[2:45:23] <Visorak6> Wait a second are you astrally projecting?
[2:45:36] <%akscully> light everything up
[2:45:37] <%Frost_Quill> can you light the candles?
[2:45:38] <chaosbringer28> focus on candles to light them btw
[2:45:38] <+vaderxyz1970> This place reminds me of Gridania
[2:45:40] <harmless_toast> @ThomasOfTroy why not? this is the same universe that has a quantum moon supersuposed between 6 different orbits
[2:45:41] <Visorak6> Pat your hand is missing correct?
[2:45:42] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Any cool signals?

[2:49:10] <AoiRob> or kick your ass
[2:49:12] <%ape_hawk> what if you talk to him and he tells you hes a light cop?
[2:49:14] <iosephe> or rend you limb from limb
[2:49:16] <TheRealNumberJ42> yeah he looks friendly
[2:49:25] <%DrTomT18> Nomai communicated with writing, these guys communicate with pictures, I guess
[2:49:28] <%Valdorick> Bold to assume all xenos are friendly.
[2:49:33] <harmless_toast> what part of looking creepy as hell made you think they were friendly?
[2:49:37] <%kraken_lab> I terrified he's going to be a chaser or some shit
[2:49:41] <+emperri> then who was chair
[2:49:42] <jorniev> HE IS UP
[2:49:42] <%valriot> monkaS Ghost
[2:49:42] <Zudrag> imagine some freaky 4 eyed alien runs into your dark house and just starts babbling
[2:49:46] <%derpy_platypus> you every think, they're not friendly?
[2:49:49] <%Frost_Quill> wherever the projector is.
[2:49:51] <iosephe> in the ghost realm
[2:49:53] <%Maids4lyfe> oh deer
[2:49:54] <waltzqueen> @harmless_toast space is pretty as hell and still terrifying
[2:49:56] <AoiRob> in fron of the projector evidently
[2:50:04] <ChungusQuest> G-G-G-G-GHOST HOME MOVIES

[2:50:26] <cheapdoc> These dudes are really tall
[2:50:26] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Reminds me of that guy from Over the Garden Wall
[2:50:27] <reonome> monkaS
[2:50:28] <Medo3G> please no
[2:50:33] <%ape_hawk> and your light can be turned off
[2:50:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> and there is a button for Conceal
[2:50:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh no
[2:50:36] <harmless_toast> but why would you need to hide...
[2:50:37] <+twohitgood> was thinking that when it had the "conceal" function.
[2:50:39] <AluxStreams> I noped out of this section like 6 hours ago.
[2:50:40] <cheapdoc> and you do have a conceal button
[2:50:40] <+emperri> if there ends up being enemies and you have to extinguish a bridge to kill it I will freak out
[2:50:43] <DianaTheAscian> mmmm
[2:50:43] <%derpy_platypus> Baby mode?
[2:50:44] <KasiCrafter> FeelsAmnediaMan
[2:50:45] <%valriot> LUL
[2:50:47] <%livlinn> woolieOMG
[2:50:50] <%A_Zealous_Retort> REDUCED FRIGHTS IN OPTIONS OH NO
[2:50:50] <%Mattais88> Redduced Frights?
[2:50:51] <%tank7013> Well if there was an option to turn the spooks down then there must be SOMETHING that happens right?
[2:50:51] <Zudrag> thank you
[2:50:51] <%JonathLP> Did that option say reduced frights?
[2:50:52] <harmless_toast> conceal, don't feel!
[2:50:52] <Saltmeisterr> REDUCEDFRIGHTS
[2:50:52] <TheRealNumberJ42> coward LUL
[2:50:53] <cureneckbeard> nyannSmug
[2:50:53] <%Monkeyweed21> REDUCED FRIGHTS
[2:50:54] <%DrTomT18> lmao I thought you were gonna turn on Coward Mode (like me!)
[2:50:55] <nomos42> yeh I did the same
[2:50:56] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:50:57] <%Frost_Quill> @cheapdoc I think that hides the flame.
[2:50:58] <leole11> he's upping the gamma NOW?
[2:50:59] <+emperri> still dont like it
[2:51:02] <waltzqueen> REDUCED FRIGHTS
[2:51:02] <ChungusQuest> oh fuck there's a "reduced frights" option
[2:51:04] <Teras_ode> SURE
[2:51:05] <+BloodyBurney> the "reduced frights" option alone is giving me anxiety
[2:51:05] <ZilverZap> f r i g h t s
[2:51:07] <nomos42> it's a problem
[2:51:09] <+Lokibringer> reduced frights? rooBooli
[2:51:09] <%Buzzard42> that's the point
[2:51:12] <leole11> oh just you wait
[2:51:13] <reonome> spooks
[2:51:14] <mr_saturday93> plz don't do baby mode
[2:51:15] <RyuuAoi> It was dark af tho
[2:51:17] <%heyitsbrian> max that gamma
[2:51:19] <+emperri> turn the alpha up to "coward"
[2:51:19] <FleshFriend> lots of places to circle around, if you were to be chased monkaS
[2:51:23] <ZilverZap> "reduced fights" mode is now selectable
[2:51:25] <TheRealNumberJ42> it's supposed to be dark af
[2:51:28] <vVAstrAVv> thats usually the idea pat
[2:51:30] <cheapdoc> @Frost_Quill yup, light based angler fish instead of sound, I'm guessing
[2:51:43] <%derpy_platypus> psaGoblin
[2:51:44] <AoiRob> go down coward!!
[2:51:46] <+dmbender> is this supposed to be a dark and spooky game? I've never played it before.
[2:51:58] <crazypieman7> please stop just walking into the darkness you're going to give me a heart attack
[2:51:59] <%A_Zealous_Retort> Pat this is a horror game now going by that thing in gameplay options
[2:52:00] <%Monkeyweed21> you can light candles @PatStaresAt
[2:52:04] <chaosbringer28> dont forget you can light candles by focusing the map
[2:52:04] <%Valdorick> By the way pat, you missed it, you can focus on candles to turn them on
[2:52:06] <+JPivot> @dmbender the dlc is a lot more darker and spookier than the base game
[2:52:07] <chaosbringer28> lamp*
[2:52:08] <%tank7013> God this is like a damn Souls level
[2:52:18] <%ShogunNoonto> rabbit73BlanchLaugh rabbit73DorothyGrump rabbit73RosePog
[2:52:20] <cheapdoc> @dmbender depends, how scared are you about space?

[2:52:46] <%strakillias> This is some Stxy river shit here
[2:52:48] <+dmbender> @dmbender are we talking about like spooky scary scary, or like limitless existential dread scary?
[2:52:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> or are you just on the other side?
[2:52:51] <vVAstrAVv> @dmbender it HAS spooks. its not the whole point though. it was like 15% of the main game
[2:52:54] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I'll miss you raft kun
[2:53:01] <$ringabal> Think about Raft
[2:53:06] <Visorak6> I wonder if the explosion will take longer to get to you here
[2:53:09] <TheRealNumberJ42> ...
[2:53:10] <+JPivot> @dmbender both
[2:53:10] <%derpy_platypus> focus
[2:53:14] <chaosbringer28> focus the lantern
[2:53:17] <+dmbender> I'm a baby and spooky things scare me. I couldn't get past the sewers in Fallout 3 because of the ghouls
[2:53:18] <vVAstrAVv> @dmbender YES! lol
[2:53:19] <raikagelord1> Can’t he use the Flashlight to light the candles???
[2:53:19] <+emperri> PogChamp
[2:53:26] <FleshFriend> 👌 lit
[2:53:34] <%SirGO0SE> fam
[2:53:34] <+emperri> I wonder if this will end up being a bad idea
[2:53:35] <chaosbringer28> this map gets very very dark, so its good to remember to do that
[2:53:43] <iosephe> and jetpack
[2:53:44] <crazypieman7> the lantern is a flashlight if you keep it on focus
[2:53:45] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS
[2:53:46] <$ringabal> YEAH OKAY
[2:53:47] <garbageheaphound> NOT A FAN

[2:53:51] <%tank7013> Uhhhhhhh
[2:53:51] <%SveriSageAdvice> Dont care much for THAT
[2:53:51] <mr_saturday93> wtf was that?
[2:53:54] <%asgard147> limesS
[2:53:55] <%A_Zealous_Retort> what if you need to hide in darkness hence the conceal option and extinguishing candles
[2:53:57] <Saltmeisterr> COOL
[2:53:58] <DianaTheAscian> imagine if the fire was a limited resource
[2:53:58] <hewwogames> this culture may have an amazing ringworld but their flashlight technology fucking sucks
[2:53:59] <AoiRob> ooo hate thaaat
[2:54:00] <RyuuAoi> Okay you can leave now.
[2:54:01] <%DrTomT18> I wonder what that means
[2:54:02] <DianaTheAscian> fuck that
[2:54:05] <%chiazam> Yeah there’s definitely NO timer here
[2:54:06] <leole11> cute mural :)
[2:54:06] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Turn off the lights?

[2:54:22] <chaosbringer28> hey guess what, its time

[2:54:23] <%kraken_lab> THere it is
[2:54:25] <TheRealNumberJ42> time to die
[2:54:26] <%Mattais88> Be you its at the end of the river
[2:54:27] <KasiCrafter> Is that the supernova theme?
[2:54:28] <jorniev> end of universe while you sleep
[2:54:29] <%valriot> monkaS 👍
[2:54:29] <AoiRob> oh it's End Times
[2:54:29] <%livlinn> Oh nooo
[2:54:30] <ExpressNode> So I spent forever yesterday trying to get my computer Windows 11 ready and didn't know that it would be a hassle going in.
[2:54:30] <+Yamchadassist> i like that the song sounds more distant
[2:54:31] <+emperri> so time keeps going in here
[2:54:33] <ChungusQuest> oh shit yeah, that's subtle
[2:54:34] <stoatacious> sun death time
[2:54:34] <Visorak6> Hey its the end of the world music
[2:54:35] <leole11> it's so muted
[2:54:36] <cheapdoc> Last time, it opened in darkness, but how darkness?
[2:54:36] <cureneckbeard> This is what the world looks like to Pat
[2:54:37] <chaosbringer28> go kill yourself for our amusement
[2:54:39] <$ringabal> SNAP BACKT O REALITY
[2:54:40] <%polothegreatest> bite da dust psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:54:41] <%DrTomT18> You're asleep Pat,
[2:54:43] <%A_Zealous_Retort> you are dreaming/astral projecting?
[2:54:44] <hewwogames> ATP pulls your memories back when it's done
[2:54:44] <%kraken_lab> YOur time in the shadow lands draws short
[2:54:44] <%tank7013> Was literally just about to ask if this area existed outside of the cycle
[2:54:45] <%derpy_platypus> slowed time maybe?
[2:54:45] <Teras_ode> dreaming doesn't stop time
[2:54:46] <waltzqueen> your body is on the Stranger!
[2:54:46] <+SeventhVice> dumbass
[2:54:47] <harmless_toast> time is still passing in the real world?
[2:54:54] <buhbuhboat> your body in the real world
[2:54:55] <TheRealNumberJ42> well your body is sleeping right?
[2:54:56] <KasiCrafter> Well, the dead guys were still there, so maybe you?
[2:54:58] <chaosbringer28> go die pat
[2:55:00] <vVAstrAVv> pat YOU are in a time loop
[2:55:00] <iosephe> ...not quite?
[2:55:01] <vvastrel> It's almost as if you're just sleeping
[2:55:01] <%linSP> its the end of the universe baby
[2:55:02] <+emperri> nah this has to be like a pocket universe
[2:55:04] <AoiRob> i mean. your body's still presumably in the room
[2:55:05] <+Yopie> let pat delude himself further
[2:55:06] <+tomdwarf> I mean, yeah. This could also be a dreamscape.
[2:55:06] <chaosbringer28> just throw yourself oof the cliff
[2:55:07] <+JPivot> @dmbender base game has one area out of like, eight or so, that is spooky
[2:55:07] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt It's a timer to Ash Twin getting destroyed and resetting
[2:55:11] <56Bagels> @dmbender there is one humongous scary bit but it's not exactly a surprise and it's relegated to one specific spot
[2:55:12] <FleshFriend> well, the question is is this reality?
[2:55:13] <%A_Zealous_Retort> you are in the owl people matrix
[2:55:15] <%cobalt_phoenix_> this feels like a dream
[2:55:15] <ZilverZap> think this is more like VR
[2:55:15] <leole11> it really isn't clear
[2:55:15] <%Caped_Eggy> I doubt this is a physical place
[2:55:15] <RiverBirch> If the timer exists, then there's two possible explanations.
[2:55:17] <harmless_toast> the owl/deer people's bodies were still all in the room, why wouldn't yours be?
[2:55:17] <+Mondeiya> jump in the water
[2:55:18] <cureneckbeard> haruchiSleep haruchiSleep haruchiSleep haruchiSleep haruchiSleep
[2:55:23] <Teras_ode> time is not stopped, thats what matters
[2:55:25] <jorniev> dont you wanna meet the antlers guy?
[2:55:27] <@TheYellowcouch> Also the eye did effect this system as well didn't it.
[2:55:31] <+extantCadence> @dmbender There is a setting to "reduce frights" for the dlc, though I'm not sure what exactly it does
[2:55:34] <ZilverZap> Your body still exist in the real world
[2:55:36] <hewwogames> so from the start of the song to forced game over, it's about 3 minutes, right?
[2:55:41] <%Valdorick> You ever have time flow 1:1 when you're in a dream? I thought so.
[2:55:44] <cureneckbeard> extantcadence: it reduces frights
[2:55:46] <FleshFriend> SPEED
[2:55:46] <%topendbuzza> also the atp will grab you anyway
[2:55:50] <ipodstroker_> yeah I figured you're astral projecting or something which is why you don't have all your gear
[2:55:56] <+ShedVolans> Death?
[2:55:58] <waltzqueen> woah
[2:55:59] <leole11> the BELL
[2:56:01] <Teras_ode> LUL
[2:56:01] <%cobalt_phoenix_> LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[2:56:02] <ZilverZap> LUL
[2:56:02] <akitanito> welp
[2:56:02] <+Yamchadassist> wow that timing
[2:56:02] <+ShedVolans> Death
[2:56:02] <%ThomasOfTroy> I'm 100% betting that you're still in the pod, and you're seeing either memories or a shared world for people in suspended animation, meaning that time would matter (but maybe stretched out)
[2:56:03] <%Valdorick> BLUEBALLED

[2:56:13] <buhbuhboat> shiver me timbers
[2:56:13] <%SirGO0SE> timing
[2:56:14] <Saltmeisterr> HAAARRRRKKK
[2:56:14] <%asgard147> at least now you know where to go pat
[2:56:15] <akitanito> the bel-
[2:56:15] <DianaTheAscian> damn it
[2:56:19] <%DrTomT18> SO CLOSE
[2:56:21] <AoiRob> i hate that it was pitch black
[2:56:22] <%Frost_Quill> So is that like VR then?
[2:56:23] <$ringabal> I'LL BE THE ROOOOOOOUNDABOUT

[2:56:29] <mr_saturday93> NEXT TIME ON DBZ
[2:56:30] <Medo3G> !uptime
[2:56:30] <@Moobot> @Medo3G I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 56m.
[2:56:33] <%thedankestmeeme> WHAT A CLIFFHANGER
[2:56:34] <%Valdorick> What if you destroy the ashtwin project?
[2:56:34] <AoiRob> cue zelda dark world music
[2:56:35] <%Faustgesicht> Darn you, heat death of the universe
[2:56:35] <HiveMasterMind> Is dream time slower?
[2:56:36] <+BloodyBurney> so theres two new zones, stranger and dreamscape. how is this game so good?
[2:56:39] <Saltmeisterr> btw pat you missed a slide
[2:56:40] <Visorak6> I guess it makes sense because when the facility would be destroyed it forces you to loop regardless
[2:56:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt theres also a church in the first group of buildings
[2:56:45] <DianaTheAscian> u did a lot that run
[2:56:46] <%Treuan> Very horror game feel
[2:56:47] <%derpy_platypus> this about where I reached, Night Pat and chat o7
[2:56:53] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Check to see if there is a fire room in the first set of houses?
[2:56:57] <%Mr_Pylon> This DLC makes me VERY excited for whatever they do next.
[2:57:02] <%ShogunNoonto> ShogunNoonto subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 29 months, currently on a 2 month streak! its that really cool game i never got
[2:57:10] <blastazoid00> Does it mesh well with the original game?
[2:57:26] <iosephe> I wish it weren't horror, but it does a really good job of it
[2:57:29] <waltzqueen> @blastazoid00 so-so , so far
[2:57:39] <%tank7013> @Valdorick If you could it would probably be a joke ending like when you destroy spacetime
[2:57:39] <%DrTomT18> @blastazoid00 Yeah. It's a seperate story but its still grounded in Outer Wilds
[2:57:40] <+emperri> big fan of nightmare universe
[2:57:42] <cheapdoc> @blastazoid00 it's a new mystery
[2:57:51] <%A_Zealous_Retort> do the different towers lead to different dream-places?
[2:58:22] <%Valdorick> @tank7013 Well, in basegame, you can destroy it and 'escape the sun's explosion'... and it is a fake ending... so it would likely just trigger that, I guess.
[2:58:26] <%jtdobyns> I wish there was more games likes these.
[2:58:27] <%Frost_Quill> so is that one of their ships?
[2:58:31] <nomos42> I wouldn't trust the journal saying places are fully explored fyi
[2:58:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is it normal that i don't feel as anxious watching pat do this as opposed to doing it myself?
[2:58:41] <DianaTheAscian> is the vault in here or in the dream?
[2:58:56] <%DrTomT18> you still haven't look at the bell in the water after the Dam breaks
[2:58:58] <leole11> i beat the dlc, it works just fine
[2:59:00] <JojoPiero> artefact in the Tower might be Language, it seems important
[2:59:01] <%Monkeyweed21> the Endless universe? I didnt see any FIDSI
[2:59:04] <$ringabal> Ride Raft
[2:59:05] <Fenlig> Is this a halo?
[2:59:07] <$ringabal> Life Good
[2:59:12] <+emperri> so what the fuck happens to the window
[2:59:13] <DianaTheAscian> @cobalt_phoenix_ yes very
[2:59:21] <%Mr_Pylon> John Hearthian
[2:59:23] <%A_Zealous_Retort> is this halo infinite?
[2:59:24] <Saltmeisterr> RAFT FIGHT BACK
[2:59:24] <harmless_toast> it's a ring world, yes
[2:59:26] <Fenlig> Are you the master chef?
[2:59:26] <%tank7013> @Valdorick Oh yea I forgot about that one
[2:59:29] <Teras_ode> there's a ring world and a flood
[2:59:44] <%A_Zealous_Retort> does something hit the window?
[2:59:44] <akitanito> ring colonies are an old concept though
[2:59:48] <%topendbuzza> yes but it has walls
[2:59:50] <harmless_toast> where are the green bits?
[2:59:52] <+cursedwithadhd> kind of because it's not exactly a Galaxy destroying super weapon
[3:00:02] <Fenlig> man this game just gives me feels with just its music
[3:00:04] <%thedankestmeeme> he's not master chief he's John Halo
[3:00:09] <%DrTomT18> I wonder why
[3:00:12] <vVAstrAVv> luckily the rafts are indestructible
[3:00:22] <jubejube56> emergency green slat power generators?
[3:00:27] <cureneckbeard> then why don't they build the whole place out of rafts
[3:00:29] <KasiCrafter> The solar sails?
[3:00:32] <Teras_ode> I'm not sure it's a window since you looked at it up close
[3:00:35] <%A_Zealous_Retort> could go check out the slats in your ship outside
[3:00:37] <chaosbringer28> dont forget to shoot the dam with the probe
[3:00:43] <harmless_toast> @topendbuzza yeah, arguably that makes it an O'Neil cylinder, not a ring world / halo
[3:00:58] <ZE_Count> dat dam
[3:01:08] <cheapdoc> Why is it breaking tho
[3:01:09] <chaosbringer28> pat get ready to jump btw
[3:01:09] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt there was a projector on the left side but you found no reels
[3:01:15] <Jakerham_Lincoln> since Woolie is into kites now its Pat's new hobby going to be white water rafting
[3:01:20] <Jakerham_Lincoln> cause I'd pay money to see that
[3:01:22] <%DrTomT18> Its old
[3:01:25] <Visorak6> Do you think the slats open because the hydroelectric power fails when the dam breaks?
[3:01:26] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:01:29] <AoiRob> old
[3:01:30] <%Valdorick> well then.
[3:01:33] <harmless_toast> bye boat!
[3:01:40] <$ringabal> Raft Gone
[3:01:42] <+Arengaur> Same thing happened to me lol
[3:01:45] <KasiCrafter> ALMOST japed
[3:01:45] <%A_Zealous_Retort> wait can you shortcut up the dams face rather than going all the way around the ring?
[3:01:45] <%DrTomT18> Saw a video of a dude taking that lift right as the dam broke, it was awesome
[3:01:46] <$ringabal> Life not so Good
[3:01:56] <+emperri> think about raft. regret
[3:01:56] <leole11> raft :(
[3:01:59] <vVAstrAVv> shoot probe on ground
[3:02:03] <leole11> adrift
[3:02:05] <%Valdorick> What pat?

[3:02:16] <%Frost_Quill> no
[3:02:16] <%A_Zealous_Retort> ...no
[3:02:16] <%kraken_lab> what was that
[3:02:16] <cheapdoc> nope
[3:02:17] <Zudrag> it looked like a graphical glitch
[3:02:17] <%Ne1son> No

[3:03:22] <%SirGO0SE> psaCrazyhead
[3:03:25] <%Frost_Quill> oh wonder if there's a secret if you jump in after it
[3:03:27] <crazypieman7> @Valdorick this is the front
[3:03:35] <vVAstrAVv> its back
[3:03:38] <%walternatorz> figuring out them speed running tactics
[3:03:52] <%barkon345> wait they made DLC for this game? is this supposed to take before the ending?
[3:03:54] <%Valdorick> The helm is on the other side of the river, isn't it?
[3:03:56] <cheapdoc> Solar powered?
[3:03:58] <%DrTomT18> Good timing
[3:03:59] <%A_Zealous_Retort> its showing the slats expanding
[3:03:59] <TheRealNumberJ42> hmmmm
[3:04:02] <mr_saturday93> they were big boys
[3:04:08] <ZilverZap> were they planning to get out of the sun's range?
[3:04:09] <leole11> it just did actually
[3:04:12] <%Monkeyweed21> SOLAR SAILS
[3:04:12] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Oh since the sun is novaing it's not getting the light it needds
[3:04:13] <%Frost_Quill> gathering power I guess?
[3:04:13] <%Ne1son> hmm yes apagee
[3:04:13] <hewwogames> daaaamn pat knows the word apogee
[3:04:15] <+emperri> it's a good thing he didn't watch that happen
[3:04:15] <%Agami23> oh god it really is a tiny piece of a dyson sphere
[3:04:16] <+tomdwarf> Looks like its designed to absorb solar energy
[3:04:16] <Saltmeisterr> solar power?
[3:04:16] <%SirGO0SE> are they trying to absorb it or something
[3:04:23] <%Monkeyweed21> TO RIDE AWAY FROM THE SUPERNOVA
[3:04:23] <Kalarchis> solar panels?
[3:04:24] <HiveMasterMind> Is that ring at the edge Dark Bramble dimension
[3:04:26] <jubejube56> as the sun goes supernova slats go open
[3:04:29] <harmless_toast> so they're like solar sails?
[3:04:29] <leole11> god luck strikes again
[3:04:30] <%A_Zealous_Retort> its in low orbit and it needs power to boost its orbit further away?
[3:04:32] <raikagelord1> I think it just did?
[3:04:35] <%JonathLP> star sailor?
[3:04:36] <%Mattais88> Solar sails to GTFO?
[3:04:44] <CatsDrunkonCopper> solar sails
[3:04:49] <+emperri> do they know the loop is happening?
[3:04:51] <cheapdoc> What happens when it's full?
[3:04:55] <%dekkitout> Is that blue line the heliopause?
[3:04:56] <ZE_Count> sending >
[3:04:58] <TheRealNumberJ42> it is a mystery
[3:04:59] <harmless_toast> is that the ship's energy level rising? or the sun's?
[3:04:59] <%SirGO0SE> they want to use the explosion as propulsion?!?!?
[3:05:01] <%Monkeyweed21> those are the solar sails
[3:05:01] <ZE_Count> ?
[3:05:02] <%walternatorz> different stages?
[3:05:02] <MartyFun11> That's the range of the supernova
[3:05:05] <bear_breaker20> thats cthulus paenus
[3:05:08] <Edsta94> the eyes signal
[3:05:08] <%Monkeyweed21> the edge of the supernova
[3:05:09] <$ringabal> Phases of the sun, by my estimate
[3:05:09] <cheapdoc> A loop?
[3:05:10] <buhbuhboat> range of the supernover i think
[3:05:11] <jubejube56> well wasn't there an issue with the navigation or something?
[3:05:11] <%A_Zealous_Retort> "this star is exploding heres the steps to GTFO"
[3:05:12] <knotsundownsyndrome> is that meant to be a solar sail?
[3:05:12] <%Agami23> i think its the edge of the solar orbit, but could be wrong
[3:05:13] <%kraken_lab> Maybe its the signal for the eye?
[3:05:13] <%Frost_Quill> Oh are these guys responsible for Bramble?
[3:05:15] <AoiRob> is the the nova's range?
[3:05:16] <Abyssal_Jaguar> What if you need to take power from this thing to the shadow world?
[3:05:19] <%Valdorick> I imagine they're trying to find the eye outside the system too.
[3:05:20] <%Maids4lyfe> supernova
[3:05:23] <%kraken_lab> Like from the first cip
[3:05:24] <vVAstrAVv> its leaving the supernovas range
[3:05:28] <Edsta94> it's 100% the eyes signal
[3:05:31] <buhbuhboat> cause you don't die at the end of the loop you just reset
[3:05:35] <+dmbender> I love the wood interior of this space station
[3:05:35] <%Monkeyweed21> those are solar sails to sail away from the Supernova
[3:05:36] <%topendbuzza> super nova range?
[3:05:39] <Teras_ode> is it that nuke space engine thing? to use the explosion as thrust?
[3:05:44] <nomos42> yeye
[3:05:48] <%Frost_Quill> is that blood in the elevator?
[3:05:53] <%Valdorick> Yeah, but you can outrun it in base game LUL
[3:05:56] <%Frost_Quill> or just dirt?
[3:05:57] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Link bedtween this place and the dark
[3:05:57] <+emperri> oh cool shortcut
[3:05:58] <harmless_toast> this sun is tiny and so is its supernova

[3:07:03] <KasiCrafter> Supernova ranges ARE outrageous, but have you EVER died to the supernova while in this ring ship?
[3:07:10] <Teras_ode> so it was it
[3:07:16] <%tank7013> I'm kinda surprised they just tell you that honestly
[3:07:16] <ZilverZap> Yea they ARE planning to get out of being exploded
[3:07:21] <vVAstrAVv> told ya betch lol
[3:07:28] <cheapdoc> If they could move BEYOND the reach of the supernova, they must've been able to teleport or something
[3:07:33] <%strakillias> Is this DLC just gonna be the good end to the game
[3:07:39] <cheapdoc> That's mad range
[3:07:39] <chaosbringer28> youve never been killed while here, its always recalled you
[3:07:48] <%Monkeyweed21> B A N A N A S
[3:07:49] <%Frost_Quill> Wonder what happens if you disable ash twin and then come here?  You shouldn't get pulled back in time right?
[3:07:49] <%A_Zealous_Retort> guess its important to get to that room quickly in later loops
[3:07:53] <HiveMasterMind> Do you have to put the Advanced Warp Core in the Stranger somewhere so you don't reset after the supernova?
[3:07:55] <%DrTomT18> ayy always happy to get a shout out
[3:08:03] <+tomdwarf> @cheapdoc The player can with their own ship, so its possible with just the normal tech
[3:08:04] <crazypieman7> put the scout on the dam?
[3:08:05] <harmless_toast> the sun gets bigger, but further away
[3:08:06] <%ThomasOfTroy> You brained yourself on some rocks
[3:08:07] <+emperri> that seems ridiculous, I don't think a solar sail could accelerate something this size that quickly
[3:08:08] <waltzqueen> @strakillias idk the solanum ending was pretty good i thought. bittersweet but good
[3:08:10] <%kraken_lab> I don't think I don't think the normal end is a bad end
[3:08:12] <nomos42> probe the dam
[3:08:12] <chaosbringer28> i think its riding the supernova out of the systme
[3:08:13] <hewwogames> pat fire a probe onto the dam
[3:08:15] <chaosbringer28> shoot the dam with your probe
[3:08:15] <+rafaelba93> ash twin goes out first
[3:08:21] <buhbuhboat> ATP recalls you after 24 minutes regardless of if you die
[3:08:29] <cheapdoc> @tomdwarf Wait, you can? I thought it always caught up to you
[3:08:33] <%Frost_Quill> oh yeah what's in the dam
[3:08:35] <harmless_toast> can the scout read the dam's structural integrity like it can for pieces of brritle hollow?
[3:08:37] <KasiCrafter> Well. I think you timed out because the Ash Twins have COMPLETELY VAPORIZED. Which. You kinda need for memory time travel
[3:08:38] <hewwogames> probe the dam thing
[3:08:38] <AoiRob> pat they just told you the Stranger moves away from the sun
[3:08:44] <%Frost_Quill> like in the water at the dam
[3:08:52] <Teras_ode> are you SURE you want to be walking on that thing?
[3:08:55] <%ForlornCarton> Swim?
[3:08:56] <%kraken_lab> Man
[3:09:00] <TheRealNumberJ42> if only you could swim
[3:09:05] <+emperri> lol neat
[3:09:06] <%DrTomT18> OH
[3:09:08] <%A_Zealous_Retort> SURFACE INTEGRITY
[3:09:10] <%kraken_lab> What if you take the core out of the ATP and then get on the stranger
[3:09:10] <+emperri> countdown
[3:09:10] <hewwogames> surf's up
[3:09:13] <iosephe> I would get off this dam
[3:09:13] <chaosbringer28> there you go
[3:09:15] <Estuko> HUH
[3:09:17] <%Frost_Quill> oh
[3:09:19] <MartyFun11> You should probably leave
[3:09:20] <jubejube56> and now there is a timer
[3:09:22] <$ringabal> RAFT COME BACK
[3:09:23] <%A_Zealous_Retort> you uh should probably get off the dam huh
[3:09:23] <vVAstrAVv> pat for completions sake i should mention there are underwater things that count for reservoir exploration
[3:09:27] <chaosbringer28> QUICKLY GET TO A RAFT FOR FUN
[3:09:30] <AoiRob> get the ffffuck out
[3:09:31] <@Ranryu692> LUL your raft made it back
[3:09:39] <KasiCrafter> Kawabunga dood
[3:09:40] <%dekkitout> Surfs up buckaroo
[3:09:50] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv why should you mention that?
[3:09:55] <%strakillias> @waltzqueen I meant good end more in terms of saving people.  Base game ending rules but everybody timber hearth still dies. This ship can maybe outrun the nova
[3:09:57] <waltzqueen> HELL YEAH
[3:10:07] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast because hes ocd
[3:10:08] <JojoPiero> pat forgot Brittle Hollow strats
[3:10:12] <%G_Thunders> God damn when the horror parts start up they are stressful as hell
[3:10:12] <$ringabal> "That sign can't stop me cuz I can't read!"
[3:10:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> This sign won't stop me because I can't read
[3:10:16] <%DashXero> Why does this surface integrity countdown seem bad?
[3:10:17] <%DrTomT18> this sign can't stop me because I can't read!
[3:10:19] <%A_Zealous_Retort> wanna watch the dam go from upstream?
[3:10:19] <%Ne1son> WAtch it GOOOOO
[3:10:21] <+DotRook> This sign could stop me if I could read is a mod
[3:10:22] <Teras_ode> that sign can't stop me cause I can't understand it
[3:10:23] <AoiRob> THAT SIGN CANT STOP ME BECAUSE I CANT READ
[3:10:24] <cheapdoc> Wait, the damn is still full, not a crack on this side
[3:10:25] <+DotRook> mood*
[3:10:27] <%DashXero> Oh.
[3:10:28] <+JPivot> wet floor sign
[3:10:31] <+DotRook> lol
[3:10:35] <cheapdoc> and the water level goes down
[3:10:38] <$ringabal> RAFT NOO
[3:10:39] <@Ranryu692> with your raft LUL
[3:10:46] <FleshFriend> soo cool
[3:10:49] <%topendbuzza> LUL
[3:10:49] <leole11> that's pretty cool
[3:10:52] <%DrTomT18> you should ride the tidal wave
[3:10:54] <Teras_ode> cool
[3:10:54] <+dmbender> man the Aesthetic of this game is really damn cool
[3:10:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> now THAT'S some sick gnar
[3:10:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn, this place is a nightmare. Who built it like this LUL
[3:11:02] <%Mr_Pylon> wicked shit
[3:11:03] <ZilverZap> destructibility in this game is cool
[3:11:03] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv so tell him that later when he's trying to 100% the game if he hasn't found it himself
[3:11:03] <cheapdoc> This is dizzying
[3:11:03] <%tank7013> Neat
[3:11:10] <%JonathLP> OH SHIT IT"S COMING BACK
[3:11:11] <%DrTomT18> yeah that is SUPER cool to watch lmao
[3:11:14] <AoiRob> this game's so fucking cool
[3:11:29] <%dekkitout> Physics 🌈 ✨
[3:11:31] <%livlinn> psaWink
[3:11:33] <leole11> bell :)
[3:11:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> you gotta surf that shit all the way around
[3:11:36] <+Like51bears> luck
[3:11:41] <cheapdoc> Did they know that their own damn would break?
[3:11:43] <reonome> damn good job
[3:11:44] <+JPivot> awesome lol
[3:11:49] <%DrTomT18> when in doubt, look under it
[3:11:49] <chaosbringer28> congrats you found that with the game telling you
[3:11:51] <+dmbender> woahhhh
[3:11:52] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast we move on
[3:11:53] <leole11> HMMMMM
[3:11:54] <Teras_ode> well done
[3:11:56] <%JonathLP> Why does that look like an iron maiden?
[3:11:57] <+Yamchadassist> FrEe Me
[3:12:01] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv see? no backseating necessary
[3:12:04] <chaosbringer28> need a lantern
[3:12:05] <%SirGO0SE> monkaS
[3:12:09] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oooohhh you have to turn off the seals in each of the three dreams to unlock the casket in the bell
[3:12:10] <AoiRob> is that where dracula sleeps
[3:12:19] <%DrTomT18> yeah that dam wasn't suppose to break   big surpirse there lmao
[3:12:27] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast this doesn't count as the reservoir lol
[3:12:37] <Abyssal_Jaguar> One in that first area we have looked at
[3:12:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> anything with multiple glowing magical chains should never be fucked with under any circumstances
[3:12:51] <%jtdobyns> he did not even go inside the building
[3:12:52] <nomos42> @vVAstrAVv he'll get to it
[3:12:57] <%tank7013> I wonder what even causes that to break. Like is something blocking a wateray?
[3:12:59] <leole11> reservoir? more like spendevoir
[3:13:07] <cheapdoc> I wonder if they wanted it sealed because they had their own version of your loop?
[3:13:11] <+JPivot> @vVAstrAVv dude just let him play it out lol
[3:13:18] <%DrTomT18> ghost matter cannot exist in water
[3:13:22] <AluxStreams> Water cleans out ghost matter?!
[3:13:22] <chaosbringer28> the flood lasts a long time btw
[3:13:30] <%DrTomT18> theres your fun fact for the day
[3:13:37] <chaosbringer28> so you have time to explore the flooded areas
[3:13:40] <reonome> LUL
[3:13:42] <+emperri> I thought ghost matter was like antimatter
[3:13:44] <%SirGO0SE> @tank7013 might just be that the sail is going
[3:13:45] <%Mr_Pylon> water confirmed strongest element
[3:13:47] <+emperri> is water not matter
[3:13:52] <%G_Thunders> Water kills ghost matter, that’s why your fish people species didn’t die
[3:13:52] <cheapdoc> Swim like a rat
[3:13:52] <%squidking96> psaGib  psaGib psaGib psaGib
[3:13:52] <%DrTomT18> thats why the Harthians didn't get killed by the Ghost Matter when the Nomai did, they still lived in the water
[3:13:53] <leole11> bad idea
[3:13:53] <harmless_toast> you can boost with A when you're above the surface
[3:13:53] <Abyssal_Jaguar> That place!
[3:13:55] <Visorak6> how is ghost matter even real just bring a bucket lmao
[3:13:55] <buhbuhboat> yeah thats why the hearthians survied to evolve
[3:13:55] <stoatacious> pat.
[3:13:58] <Abyssal_Jaguar> aw
[3:14:00] <Medo3G> oh no

[3:14:27] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Pat Ate for moxie before this hunt
[3:14:29] <+SeventhVice> that tower is gonna go down any second
[3:14:39] <Visorak6> Pat doesnt the tower collapse? You're gonna have to be quick
[3:14:44] <%tank7013> @SirGO0SE Oh yea that could be it
[3:14:49] <nomos42> nah there's time w

[3:14:52] <KasiCrafter> :R
[3:15:04] <AoiRob> well it fell seconds before the nova song last time
[3:15:09] <Slimeking_Mike> The tower collapses at like, the end of the loop, y'all, remember?
[3:15:16] <cheapdoc> Wait, if one of the corpses wasn't there, then what does that mean for them?
[3:15:21] <Edsta94> woah a dream world
[3:15:31] <chaosbringer28> you can light stuff pretty far away
[3:15:35] <%DrTomT18> No idea
[3:15:41] <Teras_ode> I was asking that myself
[3:15:42] <harmless_toast> perception is reality?
[3:15:43] <+emperri> didgeridoo?
[3:15:45] <%chiazam> AND IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES
[3:15:50] <%DrTomT18> is that what the kids call it these days?
[3:15:57] <Visorak6> Was that footsteps?
[3:16:04] <%Frost_Quill> is that a heartbeat?
[3:16:07] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS footsteps
[3:16:10] <harmless_toast> noisy upstairs neighbor?
[3:16:13] <Teras_ode> monkaS you heard that right
[3:16:19] <%tank7013> Well lucid dreaming right? So if it does work that way then  if you think they should be lit they'll be lit
[3:16:25] <AoiRob> man i hate it here

[3:18:06] <AoiRob> amazing
[3:18:08] <leole11> i LOVED that when it happened to me
[3:18:08] <ZilverZap> dude this game is so cool
[3:18:09] <+extantCadence> I actually hadn't seen that one
[3:18:13] <+tomdwarf> The dream is collapsing!
[3:18:14] <cheapdoc> Hard to sleep when your house is broken
[3:18:19] <crazypieman7> that was cool as fuck
[3:18:22] <%DrTomT18> the Supernova isn't far behind the Tower falling
[3:18:23] <FleshFriend> okay
[3:18:23] <%kraken_lab> BWAAAAAA
[3:18:25] <KasiCrafter> Interesting. The alarm is VERY shortly before the supernova
[3:18:26] <nomos42> inception shit
[3:18:28] <%Mr_Pylon> starting to get that goooood puzzle feel
[3:18:30] <%SirGO0SE> okay 👌
[3:18:31] <AoiRob> dream room broke
[3:18:34] <%DrTomT18> so, it don't matter lmao
[3:18:36] <%KeiganOfAstora> I'm so mad I missed this steam
[3:18:36] <+Like51bears> hard to sleep when you are upside down and drowinin
[3:18:37] <%jtdobyns> THIS GAME IS AMAZING
[3:18:37] <cheapdoc> THIS IS BETTER
[3:18:40] <Frostilk> Pats feelin it LUL
[3:18:41] <%tank7013> That sucks but also that's fine
[3:18:43] <%ape_hawk> isnt ME3 on thursday?
[3:18:46] <%DrTomT18> yeah how late you planning on doing this?
[3:18:51] <Abyssal_Jaguar> So the place you have the least amount of time to solve the dream world would be the lantern room right next to where you come in at the start?
[3:18:52] <vVAstrAVv> fuck nmh lol
[3:18:52] <SamHellbent> This is sooooo much better
[3:18:55] <vVAstrAVv> for now
[3:18:59] <+tomdwarf> Just whatever it is, its not getting done
[3:18:59] <AoiRob> this game tickles the balls just right knowwhatimean
[3:19:01] <cheapdoc> UNTIL IT'S DONE
[3:19:02] <Wanhangidyilinya> this a lot of great content
[3:19:02] <%DrTomT18> Pat can't stop now, hes too deep into the mystery
[3:19:04] <Teras_ode> so what I want to know if the ghost sounds are happening in the dream or in the real world where your body is...
[3:19:06] <%ape_hawk> friday is NMH3
[3:19:07] <+twohitgood> days are constructs
[3:19:11] <M0untain_wolf> Dream within dreams
[3:19:14] <%SirGO0SE> this game break days
[3:19:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> didnt explore the building above the submerged structure
[3:19:21] <%jtdobyns> Never went in building
[3:19:26] <Visorak6> I think its because you havent figured out the bell yet?
[3:19:28] <%Valdorick> @KasiCrafter I don't think the alarm was because of the nova or time. It doesn't take a translation to know the sign he jumped over said "DO NOT ENTER"
[3:19:34] <Saltmeisterr> you didn't fully explore the right building
[3:19:36] <%Faustgesicht> Trade Shooty space game for science space game. Sounds good
[3:19:42] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt the bullding next to the chained vault you didnt go inside
[3:19:43] <+JPivot> yeah like now would be the time to tell him about the reservoir lol
[3:19:47] <%chiazam> Hey can someone take Pat to a hospital he lost his memory
[3:19:51] <%Frost_Quill> Didn't you ignore the right side of the resevoir completely?
[3:20:10] <nomos42> there's stuff on the left too
[3:20:29] <@Ranryu692> Ranryu692 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! It took me 225 hours across two years, but I finally beat the Final Fantasy XIV trial the other day! Now I'm been working my way through Stormblood, and Lyse is the best
[3:20:30] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt never found the reservoir slides
[3:20:30] <cheapdoc> "I CAN BELIEVE IN THE PATH I'M OOOON"
[3:20:38] <Sol_Install> isn't tokyo game show tomorrow as well?
[3:20:38] <chaosbringer28> there was a project on the left side of the resovoir your never found a reel for
[3:20:39] <Visorak6> The side elevator leads directly to the resevoir right?
[3:20:50] <%A_Zealous_Retort> if theres secret elevators on the sumward side might there be one on the dark side?
[3:20:50] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you never found the reels for the projector on the left
[3:20:52] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt did you hear that a new cheat was discovered today for Rayman 3 for the PS2?
[3:20:53] <%tank7013> I wish you could steal their spaceship
[3:20:56] <leole11> there are slides
[3:20:58] <%kraken_lab> Man I like how all these highly advanced civilisations all have tech that revolves around perception
[3:21:02] <cheapdoc> @Visorak6 sure does
[3:21:04] <%Frost_Quill> Shortcut hell yeah.
[3:21:27] <vVAstrAVv> people got on my case but whos laughing now
[3:21:39] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt apparently if you name your file "PSOne" it starts in a lower resolution with texture filters turned off
[3:21:41] <%king_wragles> In a similar vein, this year is like year 3 of knowing where all pickups are for DK64
[3:21:44] <%Faustgesicht> What does rayman cheat do?
[3:21:44] <DonatelloJose> speed runners are doing God's work
[3:21:45] <%sonuke_draws> explain this cheat
[3:21:46] <AoiRob> use the raft
[3:21:46] <+emperri> why does that rayman thing sound like a setup for a ligma balls joke
[3:21:49] <AoiRob> well ok
[3:21:53] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv no one, he was going to come back here and explore more anyway
[3:21:56] <%chiazam> NEW!?!?!?!?
[3:22:01] <+AgniBrandt> I miss Rayman.
[3:22:12] <%hewlettfan96> That is insane theyre be a new cheat for such an old game

[3:22:15] <$dalmek> Everybody Loves Rayman
[3:22:18] <%A_Zealous_Retort> look in through cracks"

[3:22:20] <%Valdorick> OH! Its the place you were kicked out of in your dream.
[3:22:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> ?
[3:22:21] <%rekinom> Rayman? You mean those rabbit things?
[3:22:25] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast exactly
[3:22:33] <%kraken_lab> The 2d stuff is nice but I miss 2&3
[3:22:46] <%hewlettfan96> Rayman ahh what a sad end to a franchise
[3:22:49] <harmless_toast> @vVAstrAVv so why did you think you needed to tell him to do it?
[3:22:50] <Visorak6> bell schematic
[3:22:52] <+AgniBrandt> Oh my God Rabbids came from Rayman
[3:22:55] <+AgniBrandt> I fucking forgot
[3:23:05] <cheapdoc> The thing inside the bell, whatever that is
[3:23:09] <%kraken_lab> Did the rayman legends games come out before or after the rabbid stuff?
[3:23:27] <%A_Zealous_Retort> they burned the control to raise the bell out of the water
[3:23:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> big chain
[3:23:32] <leole11> screw that bell
[3:23:33] <%DrTomT18> they REALLY wanted to keep that thing down there
[3:23:36] <vVAstrAVv> @harmless_toast i didnt tell him to do anything. i said stuffs underwater. thats litterally it
[3:23:42] <%hewlettfan96> @rekinom Hahah no me lad back In my day Rayman used to be someone, Instead of the bum he is now, Ubisoft milking assasins creed for all its worth
[3:23:46] <%cobalt_phoenix_> chat i left after he got blueballed by the bell in the spooky world what i miss
[3:23:46] <+Yamchadassist> @kraken_lab way after
[3:23:48] <%tank7013> Some serious shit of some kind went down here
[3:23:58] <$ringabal> Pat's gonna open the bell and Diabolos is just gonna fly out
[3:24:00] <%kraken_lab> So
[3:24:00] <+emperri> whose footprints are these
[3:24:02] <%Frost_Quill> huh
[3:24:07] <jubejube56> That wasn't a slide reel on the table right?
[3:24:07] <Edsta94> looks lile they wanted to lock something or someone up tight
[3:24:11] <leole11> ded bell
[3:24:12] <cheapdoc> Guessing the thing inside the bell has something to do with the thing they used to worship
[3:24:12] <AoiRob> hi giant's deep
[3:24:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> lamp ruined
[3:24:16] <%Frost_Quill> oh the lantern went out
[3:24:18] <%DrTomT18> yes
[3:24:22] <%CatastropheCorvid> Just back from errands. Still Outer Wilds?
[3:24:25] <%kraken_lab> Techincally the serious ended on origins and legends rather then the rabbids stuff
[3:24:37] <%kraken_lab> *series
[3:24:38] <%DrTomT18> @CatastropheCorvid yes, the DLC
[3:24:41] <Teras_ode> so the fourth lore slide is still unread somewhere?
[3:24:52] <%kraken_lab> Nah its inner cities now
[3:24:53] <%CatastropheCorvid> @CatastropheCorvid Thanks!
[3:25:01] <leole11> wouldn't that be nice
[3:25:01] <%kraken_lab> Hm
[3:25:03] <%walternatorz> it looks like some tourist billboard
[3:25:15] <%kraken_lab> Actually inner cities is a pretty apt description for this dlc
[3:25:19] <Edsta94> they have slideshows instead of text, the next evolution
[3:25:25] <Teras_ode> final lore
[3:25:46] <nomos42> NotLikeThis
[3:25:47] <%kraken_lab> They also got text we just can't read any of it
[3:25:59] <%tank7013> So I was away for a bit did Pat ever go into that cave he learned about? Under the tower?

[3:32:38] <%DrTomT18> I appreciate that the animator who made this set paiges boobs to MAXIMUM giggle
[3:32:39] <%SirGO0SE> doing Eureka sounds like a hip new sci fi drug
[3:32:42] <Slimeking_Mike> dog
[3:32:49] <akitanito> no, not the human
[3:32:50] <%DrTomT18> DOOG
[3:33:03] <%A_Zealous_Retort> theres a reel in the sumberged section of the building that you missed
[3:33:06] <+SeventhVice> if you do Eureka you might as well be on drugs

[3:34:08] <%A_Zealous_Retort> lotta burned one on this reel
[3:34:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hey Pat 👋🏼 after buying new external hard drives and a micro se for my switch, it had me thinking. Damn, you think one day we’re gonna download our brains to hard drives and live forever in vr?
[3:34:23] <%A_Zealous_Retort> wait are ALL of them burned?
[3:34:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> wow it looks like every single slide on it is visibly burnt off
[3:34:36] <+emperri> SCP shit
[3:34:40] <cheapdoc> sure enough
[3:34:41] <leole11> i see....
[3:34:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @mr_saturday93 for taking down anti-vax Russian Propoganda

[3:34:50] <%DrTomT18> RIVITING
[3:34:51] <%SirGO0SE> informative :)
[3:34:54] <cholesteroid> fun noise fun noise
[3:34:55] <AoiRob> of course
[3:34:55] <%tank7013> It really seems like a lot of this place was sealed and then deliberately destroyed
[3:34:56] <%Deadpal> there ya go.
[3:34:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Damn, so they made a bioshock one sequence as dlc
[3:34:59] <teebos> deep lore
[3:35:01] <%Profmcstevie> The shapes, they speak to me
[3:35:08] <Teras_ode> they really don't want you to know huh
[3:35:10] <%ape_hawk> why are all these slides just images of my parents fighting?
[3:35:12] <vVAstrAVv> @a_zealous_retort oh i actually never noticed you see them burned on the reel itself. thanks
[3:35:12] <CatsDrunkonCopper> they really hate that bell
[3:35:17] <%DrTomT18> well that was  something
[3:35:18] <%tank7013> Oh no is this gonna become eldtritch horror?
[3:35:19] <iosephe> Bell's haunted
[3:35:19] <leole11> wow screw that reel i guess
[3:35:20] <%SirGO0SE> is it Dio????
[3:35:22] <cheapdoc> Probably a bad idea to unleash it

[3:35:25] <%cobalt_phoenix_> [REDACTED]
[3:35:31] <Zeif00> Let's open it
[3:35:35] <%asgard147> let's open it limesEvil
[3:35:36] <%Frost_Quill> [Hyperlink Blocked]
[3:35:44] <%kraken_lab> I can't wait for thr slide that uses those burned slides to facillitate a jumpscare
[3:35:45] <AoiRob> did they put a war criminal in there or some shit???
[3:35:45] <jubejube56> A bell or a *prison*
[3:35:55] <Saltmeisterr> ITS SPAMTON
[3:35:56] <%Faustgesicht> Gotta release that thing so hard tho
[3:36:01] <Saltmeisterr> HE'S IN THE BELL
[3:36:03] <+emperri> You do not recognize the bodies in the bell.
[3:36:06] <DianaTheAscian> Its clearly [Hyperlink Blocked]
[3:36:13] <$ringabal> @kraken_lab Man, I thought that one was the one
[3:36:24] <cheapdoc> [redacted]
[3:36:27] <%kraken_lab> Wait what
[3:36:31] <leole11> why would you chain someone up
[3:36:31] <%kraken_lab> There really is one?
[3:36:33] <leole11> then build a bell
[3:36:36] <leole11> THEN submerge it
[3:36:44] <%ElkRiverDog> Aren't there always 2 slides?
[3:36:49] <jubejube56> Layers of protection
[3:36:51] <%kraken_lab> God now I'm going to be anxious whenever he finds a new slide
[3:37:03] <%kraken_lab> I was already but now moreso
[3:37:07] <%DrTomT18> the fans must be like, the engine or something
[3:37:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> the sun also changes size
[3:37:11] <%cade_calrayn> oh now he's being rambunctious
[3:37:11] <%Profmcstevie> Gief HATES out wilds
[3:37:12] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[3:37:19] <cheapdoc> ... it goes down every couple of seconds
[3:37:32] <%Frost_Quill> yeah isn't there usually two slides?
[3:37:47] <cheapdoc> 100 ish seconds to retrieve an artifact and run to the nightmare of mensis
[3:37:56] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[3:37:59] <%tank7013> Y'know these probes are almost as advanced as the tech you're finding with these ancient civilizations
[3:38:13] <Teras_ode> "if I throw thing here dad will play with me"
[3:38:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> so threads right now are releasing whatever is in the bell, or figuring out whats up with the solar sail thing trying to boost you out past the supernova
[3:38:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat on your right
[3:38:37] <$ringabal> No moxie, only Raft
[3:38:37] <%kraken_lab> tbf they cribbed nomai tech for the probe
[3:38:37] <AoiRob> this is just a zelda quest now right
[3:38:49] <cheapdoc> you've got 24 seconds left
[3:38:53] <leole11> use the zelda item on the boss pat
[3:38:54] <ZE_Count> SPEED
[3:38:57] <%kraken_lab> The teleportation thing is just a black-hole white-hole key thing
[3:38:57] <AoiRob> go to the spirit realm and do the test of courage or whatever
[3:39:06] <PirateMike_> Is this an artificial river?
[3:39:07] <+dmbender> yo he be zoomin tho
[3:39:09] <jubejube56> Well based on the slides it seems like the bell is sealed by *something* probably in the dream worlds
[3:39:10] <leole11> how come you don't turn into a wolf
[3:39:23] <+dmbender> @PirateMike_ well its on a space station so yeah probably (:
[3:39:27] <AoiRob> appease the child
[3:39:37] <%asgard147> limesFeels
[3:39:37] <%DrTomT18> well there is a fire in the bell
[3:39:44] <PirateMike_> @dmbender gotcha :P
[3:39:50] <%Profmcstevie> Not enough oxygen in that there pup
[3:39:51] <%Frost_Quill> We really fucked up wolves huh.
[3:39:56] <cheapdoc> 15 seconds
[3:39:59] <AoiRob> huskys are chatty as shit
[3:40:00] <%Monkeyweed21> is this Ready Player Owl?
[3:40:00] <%SirGO0SE> tfw no awoo limesFeels
[3:40:04] <+dmbender> :^)
[3:40:06] <DianaTheAscian> I don't know if I should laugh or feel pity
[3:40:09] <%tank7013> @kraken_lab Ah. I wasn't only talking about the teleporting but I did forget that it was nomai tech
[3:40:15] <leole11> SMACK
[3:40:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Frost_Quill look at pugs and chihuahas and tell me
[3:40:19] <vVAstrAVv> you dont have to move lanterns all that far away
[3:40:22] <cheapdoc> 12 seconds
[3:40:56] <cheapdoc> 6 ish seconds
[3:40:56] <%Frost_Quill> So does time pass slower in here or something?
[3:40:59] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS footsteps
[3:41:00] <leole11> a whole ass buildinh
[3:41:06] <+tomdwarf> I mean, its a shared dreamscape. Why would time travel make this place immune? If you found someone here, they probably wouldnt remember you through loops.
[3:41:09] <cheapdoc> I undershot
[3:41:13] <%Maids4lyfe> chihuahas have been that way for hundreds of years they were naturally selected to be like that for hunting rats in Mexico
[3:41:15] <AoiRob> dreams do follow timespace it seems
[3:41:22] <%cobalt_phoenix_> monkaS
[3:41:39] <leole11> the tower shifts a bit
[3:41:39] <cheapdoc> damn, he's good
[3:41:41] <Visorak6> Its because the wave just hit the tower pat
[3:41:42] <DianaTheAscian> oh
[3:41:44] <vVAstrAVv> the wendigos
[3:41:44] <Teras_ode> big one must have been the damn in the "real" world
[3:41:45] <%Monkeyweed21> the dam just broke
[3:41:46] <+tomdwarf> No, that was the dam going off and the water hitting the tower. The dreamscape was rocked a bit.
[3:41:47] <$ringabal> OH NO
[3:41:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> is that bc of the wave outside
[3:41:49] <%Mattais88> because the twer got knocked over
[3:41:55] <leole11> do a BLJ
[3:41:56] <AoiRob> did the flood hit the tower
[3:42:03] <DianaTheAscian> umm
[3:42:07] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the dam broke and this world leans when the tower leans
[3:42:11] <Teras_ode> the question is are the ghost noises in the dream or in the waking world
[3:42:12] <jorniev> breathing
[3:42:13] <$ringabal> oh god oh fuck
[3:42:23] <butthurtdave> Hey Pat, wanted to tell you I tried getting into FF14 again after seeing you guide Paige and I think it's finally clicking for me this time.  Just got my mount and I'm having fun.   Thanks for shilling it so much boss <3
[3:42:29] <cheapdoc> look up?
[3:42:35] <jorniev> can you fast travel trough here?
[3:42:41] <%SpoonheadInExile> Why does this place remind me of Timber Hearth?
[3:42:50] <%Frost_Quill> oh can you GO to the ringed planet?
[3:42:58] <leole11> what could it MEAN?
[3:43:03] <%A_Zealous_Retort> on their home moon around the gas giant going by the earlier reels
[3:43:07] <TheRealNumberJ42> this feels like a different game i wonder if they're gonna make an outer wilds 2
[3:43:14] <+FOGSHIE> Man this DLC does not give you enough time to figure out this dream world every loop.
[3:43:19] <cheapdoc> @SpoonheadInExile In all honesty, all living civilizations in your system probably based themselves off this one
[3:43:23] <%Frost_Quill> i don't know i've avoided spoilers
[3:43:25] <%jtdobyns> Soo. We Replacing ME3 with this tomorrow?
[3:43:47] <jubejube56> So if the stranger moves away from the supernova, what happens when you disable ash twin then board the stranger?
[3:43:49] <%Valdorick> I think he said NMH3
[3:43:52] <%SpoonheadInExile> @cheapdoc Even the Nomai?
[3:43:54] <%Frost_Quill> if it suddenly ends when you get there again lol
[3:43:57] <$ringabal> Raft here. Afterlife Good.
[3:44:01] <cheapdoc> ANXIETY
[3:44:13] <cheapdoc> @SpoonheadInExile I don't know, maybe
[3:44:17] <%Mattais88> Lodge
[3:44:19] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Yes
[3:44:19] <AoiRob> @jubejube56 probly get an ending like "and then i got stuck in here forever"
[3:44:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> oh this is the one you already explored
[3:44:22] <%kraken_lab> Oh it lets you move between dreamworlds
[3:44:23] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Totally is the other place
[3:44:33] <%Profmcstevie> Good thing I wore my brown pants today
[3:44:34] <AoiRob> ye it is
[3:44:42] <%Valdorick> Yeeeeeah the bell
[3:44:45] <Estuko> Reminder tomorrow the FF14 Collector's Editions upgrade sale ($10) ends
[3:44:47] <leole11> creepy eh?
[3:44:49] <Abyssal_Jaguar> You should see if that probe % durablity comes with you in the dream
[3:44:49] <%kraken_lab> The bell
[3:44:55] <%cobalt_phoenix_> ohhhh so you can go between locations within the world
[3:45:08] <%Valdorick> Should be 22 minutes soon.
[3:45:14] <leole11> smart pat
[3:45:25] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Exactly what I was thinking!
[3:45:26] <cheapdoc> This all sounds very lovecraftian
[3:45:29] <TheRealNumberJ42> hmmm
[3:45:35] <%Profmcstevie> Damn dude nice brain
[3:45:42] <%A_Zealous_Retort> theres no casket
[3:45:52] <%drabberfaun535> Really 4d chess to lock the seal to your space station in a dream realm
[3:45:53] <%stubborndeer> Ten thousand years have passed since Paterson Red, Commander of the U.S.S. Lost dog first lost his Raft on the Ringed station of Oxylion 3. The air has grown still, and the trees have fallen silent, only the occasional creak of a space suit can be heard
[3:46:01] <%tank7013> Huh
[3:46:16] <nomos42> 'yo check this shit out!"
[3:46:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> strong bois
[3:46:26] <%Valdorick> There's a staircase in there.
[3:46:28] <%walternatorz> moving company?
[3:46:30] <Abyssal_Jaguar> There was a fire in that room in the other world!
[3:46:33] <cheapdoc> took it where?
[3:46:39] <%tank7013> They transported a physical object into the dream world?
[3:46:42] <%A_Zealous_Retort> can you go inside the bell from below
[3:46:46] <jubejube56> took it to the underwater bell
[3:46:47] <+tomdwarf> Bring an artifact into the bell, I think
[3:46:48] <%drabberfaun535> so they can teleport stuff via the dream realm?
[3:47:05] <TheRealNumberJ42> this is very lovecraft
[3:47:08] <cheapdoc> why
[3:47:09] <%tank7013> That's even weirder
[3:47:13] <leole11> dream pat
[3:47:19] <%SpoonheadInExile> This is some Lovecraft shit
[3:47:20] <%Valdorick> They fucked with Quantum Dream Physics.
[3:47:22] <%A_Zealous_Retort> where does the raft go after this?
[3:47:33] <$ringabal> THIS IS HOW CHAOS SHIT HAPPENS, MAGNUS
[3:47:38] <%Frost_Quill> yeah where does the raft go after this?
[3:47:41] <%tank7013> I was half joking when I asked if this was gonna be eldritch horror but now I'm not joking at all
[3:47:44] <cheapdoc> CHAOS
[3:47:44] <Visorak6> The tower is about to collapse
[3:47:44] <leole11> only if you ask pretty please
[3:47:52] <cheapdoc> WE HAVE TO KILL CHAOS
[3:48:15] <cheapdoc> and there is still a fire
[3:48:17] <%A_Zealous_Retort> maybe the "seals" let the casket come into the dream world where they took it to the next stop in the raft ride
[3:48:21] <%SirGO0SE> this is almost like a hub world for them it seems
[3:48:24] <%ElkRiverDog> I got the impression that there were 2 different camps about what to do about the eye
[3:48:27] <%drabberfaun535> to be fair we are dealing with quantum immortality and universe ending time travel. the bar is high for this stuff.
[3:48:30] <%Mattais88> Only way in is by sleeping in the bell probably
[3:48:35] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Take your artifact to the bell after this?
[3:48:36] <%thedankestmeeme> yeah... next loop XD
[3:48:50] <vVAstrAVv> its saying get in from the other side
[3:48:57] <+tomdwarf> No, they brought something from the real world into the dream bell
[3:49:04] <%Valdorick> Man, whatever they sealed in that bell, they fucked HATED
[3:49:05] <AoiRob> damn they must be strong
[3:49:15] <Teras_ode> does the bell room have a flame too?
[3:49:18] <+tomdwarf> I think you can bring an artifact into real world bell, and you'll teleport inside the dream bell
[3:49:20] <Visorak6> Is it what you keep hearing?
[3:49:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> wait can you use the artifact to enter the real world from inside the bell?
[3:49:25] <leole11> so, chains, dream world, underwater, 3 locks
[3:49:26] <cheapdoc> maybe something related to the eye
[3:49:27] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[3:49:31] <Abyssal_Jaguar> It did!
[3:49:34] <DianaTheAscian> prob
[3:49:34] <%A_Zealous_Retort> enter the dream world* from inside the bell
[3:49:35] <leole11> bye lmao
[3:49:36] <cheapdoc> they did fucking hate that eye
[3:49:45] <TheRealNumberJ42> moist mummies
[3:49:50] <%drabberfaun535> I wonder what the dream realm charges for shipping?
[3:50:00] <jubejube56> Oh unless somehow the contents of the sealed bell are a flame which gives you access to that dream bell room
[3:50:01] <%stubborndeer> Time
[3:50:02] <%Frost_Quill> no alarm this time
[3:50:09] <%walternatorz> was that a cave underwater?
[3:50:11] <%stubborndeer> And you pay in units of thought
[3:50:14] <DianaTheAscian> nope
[3:50:18] <%stubborndeer> so it's cryptocurrency basically
[3:50:26] <jubejube56> So they hide the coffin looking thing in the dream world, then lock the dream world entrance in a physical coffin thing
[3:50:30] <%SirGO0SE> @drabberfaun535 prime officially too slow now
[3:50:35] <jubejube56> and lock that coffin with dream world seals
[3:50:40] <+kingmemelord97> !uptime
[3:50:41] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 50m.
[3:50:46] <%DrTomT18> Just the one in the Village
[3:50:47] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Yes! I think it was in the projector room
[3:50:48] <%SveriSageAdvice> there was one i think?
[3:50:48] <nomos42> i don't think so
[3:50:55] <leole11> you could walk in the normal way, get the early artifact, go back, and take the shortcut
[3:50:56] <%SveriSageAdvice> next to the projector
[3:50:56] <+tomdwarf> There was, I think. You could Just drag one from somewhere else on the ring world and just bring it.
[3:50:59] <Abyssal_Jaguar> On the table
[3:51:01] <Saltmeisterr> projector room?
[3:51:02] <%stubborndeer> The mistake I made was not bringing a gun
[3:51:05] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you can use the shortcut to go from the start to the top
[3:51:05] <MartyFun11> You could get the one from the low village and take the shortcut up
[3:51:06] <%Frost_Quill> there was one in a projector room further along the river
[3:51:09] <%drabberfaun535> @SirGO0SE I need the dream realms catalog
[3:51:15] <nomos42> the projector room one was on the third village area
[3:51:24] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Oh! My bad
[3:51:31] <%chiazam> @patstaresat Hey so, if they went to Allll this trouble to lock something up, why are we trying to unlock it?
[3:52:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @chiazam knawledge
[3:52:10] <cheapdoc> @chiazam Have you ever read a horror novel?
[3:52:12] <leole11> what a weird bug
[3:52:17] <$ringabal> Must be the relative entrance
[3:52:18] <%chiazam> knowledge is power
[3:52:23] <%Frost_Quill> World is ending anyway, what's the harm?
[3:52:24] <+tomdwarf> Cause mystery, duh
[3:52:26] <%Valdorick> Bideo Bames, that's why
[3:52:27] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @chiazam cuz fuck it why not well just go back in time if it kills us
[3:52:27] <leole11> the worst that can happen is you die, and wake up next loop
[3:52:31] <cheapdoc> and knowing is half the battle
[3:52:32] <%DrTomT18> I'm sure nothing bad will happen
[3:52:33] <garbageheaphound> arrogance
[3:52:34] <%ape_hawk> because fuck you thats why
[3:52:37] <%the_Punktuation> There is no consequence to opening it.
[3:52:38] <%Agami23> whats the worst it can do? kill you? you'll just wake up 5 minutes later.
[3:52:39] <TheRealNumberJ42> the universe is screwed anyway might as well have some fun
[3:52:39] <DianaTheAscian> Universe is gonna end anyway
[3:52:41] <EuropanLamprey> Universe dying in 24 minutes, whats the harm?
[3:52:41] <@TheYellowcouch> you gotta know
[3:52:42] <%DrTomT18> probably. like 10% sure
[3:52:44] <vVAstrAVv> because they suck
[3:52:44] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Dude the gods gave me this really cool box and said 'Pandora, what ever you do don't open it'
[3:52:47] <CatsDrunkonCopper> whats the worst that could happen?
[3:52:49] <%SirGO0SE> maybe what they locked up has big boobs :)
[3:52:51] <%asgard147> Unleashing ancient eldrich is cool limesKnife
[3:52:52] <%the_Punktuation> Timeloop
[3:52:52] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Unless it eats the sun.
[3:52:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> it's like the apocalypse thing from Loki
[3:53:01] <%Valdorick> What if it a time leaping quantum nightmare? Then where's your god?
[3:53:10] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @Abyssal_Jaguar the sun that was gonna explode?
[3:53:11] <%CatastropheCorvid> Did someone say Catastrophe? My time has come.
[3:53:13] <Teras_ode> I you knew a possible Cthulu thing was inside a locked box, would't you want to open it?
[3:53:23] <leole11> how can a time leaping quantum nightmare be locked up in a vault
[3:53:37] <%fat_burtreynolds> Don’t Open, dead inside just sounds so cozy, ya knows
[3:53:38] <TheRealNumberJ42> i wonder how ghost matter got inside here
[3:53:43] <cheapdoc> Maybe it was a quantum vault
[3:53:45] <+SpareKeese> What does ghost matter do?
[3:54:00] <leole11> quantum dream world
[3:54:01] <MartyFun11> Ghost matter penetrated everything in the system
[3:54:02] <%DrTomT18> church place
[3:54:04] <Abyssal_Jaguar> You did!
[3:54:07] <+SpareKeese> Wait what
[3:54:10] <leole11> silly pat
[3:54:12] <mr_saturday93> @sparekeese it's also the reason for the sun exploding too early
[3:54:12] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I yelled about it like a crazy person
[3:54:12] <DianaTheAscian> kills you hard
[3:54:18] <nomos42> indeed
[3:54:21] <+megaotter> huh, they should call it death matter then
[3:54:25] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Yup!
[3:54:29] <%Valdorick> Hey wait... if they suicide pact'd... who the fuck set back up the lanterns?
[3:54:30] <jorniev> oh right
[3:54:37] <+SpareKeese> @mr_saturday93 Ooooh, huh
[3:54:40] <TheRealNumberJ42> monkaS
[3:54:42] <jorniev> they did
[3:54:47] <cheapdoc> @megaotter but it turns you into a ghots
[3:54:48] <jorniev> ITS GHOST FIRE
[3:54:52] <%chiazam> Imagine if this is where you learn the language
[3:54:52] <%CatastropheCorvid> Roast Marshmellows in the crypt.
[3:55:01] <+SpareKeese> @mr_saturday93 Thx
[3:55:02] <KasiCrafter> But isn't it the first place to go when the dam breaks?
[3:55:02] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @Valdorick whoever broke out of their restraints in the 2nd tower
[3:55:03] <%SveriSageAdvice> @Valdorick probably the dude missing from the other group
[3:55:03] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Ot
[3:55:04] <%Buzzard42> @mr_saturday93 That's incorrect!
[3:55:11] <%Buzzard42> The sun is just dying
[3:55:13] <%Frost_Quill> it might be past the bell
[3:55:15] <Abyssal_Jaguar> It's the start of the dream world water path?
[3:55:19] <+megaotter> @cheapdoc big brain
[3:55:19] <%Mattais88> Area after the other world bell?
[3:55:36] <%Buzzard42> The interloper has nothing to do with the sun going nova
[3:55:39] <mr_saturday93> @buzzard42 really? I thought I've r ad somewhere that ghost matter is the reason for shit ending
[3:55:41] <%boofybaps> This one o dem videographic games?
[3:55:58] <%DrTomT18> do not go into the water
[3:56:00] <TheRealNumberJ42> ghost matter is the reason the nomai died
[3:56:01] <RyeBreadBakery> hey y'all what did i miss
[3:56:07] <%A_Zealous_Retort> is the dream realms a cycle too? life if you go rafting in here do you go to starlit cove?
[3:56:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @mr_saturday93 ghost matter is the reason the nomai ded but sun is exploding cuz it's old
[3:56:17] <%Buzzard42> @mr_saturday93 Nope. The big reveal in the ending is that the universe is just dying and there's nothing you can do to avert it
[3:56:17] <%stubborndeer> PAt killed a reptillian
[3:56:18] <leole11> blow the door to open it
[3:56:21] <ExpressNode> Oh cool TGS is coming tomorrow or today (in Japan)
[3:56:24] <%Valdorick> Bury the Light
[3:56:26] <teebos> turn off door
[3:56:26] <%Valdorick> deep within.
[3:56:28] <leole11> blowing opens many doors?
[3:56:33] <mr_saturday93> @buzzard42 ah okay
[3:56:36] <%kraken_lab> Yeah the interloper is a red-herring
[3:56:41] <jorniev> LUL

[3:56:51] <%ape_hawk> and youll have ten minutes of screentime for the entire franchise!!!!
[3:56:52] <%tank7013> Muh darkness
[3:56:52] <Abyssal_Jaguar> We got to fight the darkness pat!
[3:56:55] <cheapdoc> Did we ever find out what kingdom hearts WAS?
[3:57:02] <%kraken_lab> To stop the player from realising theres no saving the system until further in the game
[3:57:06] <+SpareKeese> The door to dankness
[3:57:06] <vVAstrAVv> this world has been connected
[3:57:09] <%kraken_lab> same principle with the sun-station
[3:57:11] <%chiazam> @cheapdoc power
[3:57:14] <leole11> kingdom hearts is the friends we made along the way
[3:57:14] <%Agami23> kingdom hearts isnt even light.
[3:57:14] <%RetroCop87> And then an owl hops in front of you and yells "DUAL WEELD"
[3:57:16] <TheRealNumberJ42> don't lie pat we know you played all the games
[3:57:16] <$ringabal> The friends we made along the way????
[3:57:17] <%Valdorick> Kingdom Hearts was the friends you made along the way.
[3:57:21] <%cvp5127> a door?
[3:57:22] <+tomdwarf> I think it was redefnied EVERY FUCKING GAME.
[3:57:26] <%A_Zealous_Retort> Kingdom Hearts is the friends we made along the way
[3:57:26] <samsara_vt> kingdom hearts is hydaelyn
[3:57:32] <cheapdoc> @chiazam I need more power?
[3:57:35] <Abyssal_Jaguar> God it feels like that old slender game
[3:57:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> To create the universe, you must start with the apple pie
[3:57:37] <%ape_hawk> if theres a kingdom hearts, does that mean theres a kingsub hearts?
[3:57:46] <leole11> probably maybe definitely try and light up as many candles as you can
[3:57:46] <mr_saturday93> @tomdwarf eh not really. it's actually a giant moon where all light comes from
[3:57:47] <nomos42> i don't like this area
[3:57:48] <jorniev> WHEN is the sleep paralisis deemon gonna show up?
[3:57:48] <PanicSwytch> Oh god don't start that kh stuff now LUL
[3:57:49] <KasiCrafter> It IS ccalled the "Endless" Canyon

[3:58:01] <garbageheaphound> I dont like these tress looking like pople
[3:58:02] <%chiazam> That or organization 13 guy definitely wanted more power
[3:58:06] <%drabberfaun535> Is this the full length of the base game?
[3:58:11] <+SpareKeese> This whole place reads to me as a "run from something" area...
[3:58:12] <%A_Zealous_Retort> thats a bridge missing its illumination activation
[3:58:17] <Visorak6> its a bridge you havent made yet
[3:58:19] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dam just went

[4:01:19] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh that's actually not as bad as i thought
[4:01:20] <cheapdoc> They don't like you
[4:01:21] <%cade_calrayn> BAD BIRB
[4:01:22] <%heyitsbrian> Get BLOWN OUT
[4:01:23] <DigiLapin> blew your shit out
[4:01:23] <teebos> he sneezed on you
[4:01:24] <TheRealNumberJ42> he likes it?!
[4:01:24] <+emperri> he blew out your thingy
[4:01:24] <+tomdwarf> Oh, well then. They dont like people coming into their neck of the woods then.
[4:01:28] <%VHGS> rude
[4:01:28] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:30] <EternalJedi> ruuS oh
[4:01:30] <HiveMasterMind> Oh, they aren't so bad after all
[4:01:31] <+SpareKeese> That was actually pretty neat
[4:01:35] <$ringabal> SNAP BACK TO REALITY
[4:01:36] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> That's kinda cute
[4:01:38] <%DrTomT18> So, Pat... you have a body to go back too.
[4:01:39] <%chiazam> Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming swimming swimming swimming
[4:01:51] <%A_Zealous_Retort> can you conceal it to keep them from blowing it out?
[4:01:52] <mr_saturday93> surprised pat didnt scream
[4:01:59] <%walternatorz> dig up
[4:02:00] <FleshFriend> Are they not surprised an alien found a way into their dream world?
[4:02:06] <%tank7013> They're trying REALLY hard to protect this sealed object
[4:02:06] <+extantCadence> Their mouths are the part that gets me the most. My brain wants them to have beaks for sure.
[4:02:09] <%drabberfaun535> No no friends TearGlove
[4:02:09] <+SpareKeese> They just don't like you being there... and are surprisingly polite about it
[4:02:14] <%ThomasOfTroy> Honestly, raise the brightness more, it'll probably help
[4:02:18] <Abyssal_Jaguar> They found a way to merge like 4 planets worth of puzzles in 1 planet
[4:02:21] <TheRealNumberJ42> i feel like having 760 people watching in a bright lit room helps take some of the fear away
[4:02:27] <vVAstrAVv> pat just follow candles and stop wall hugging and youll navigate it somewhere easier
[4:02:28] <%SirGO0SE> @cobalt_phoenix_ I feel owed one girly shrill
[4:02:34] <nomos42> @DrTomT18 👁️
[4:02:36] <%Frost_Quill> so what the fuck is the singing thing\
[4:02:36] <%Mattais88> Tower next
[4:02:38] <mr_saturday93> so is that the ONLY scare in the DLC?
[4:02:39] <%tactician0> there is no edge scraping this shit
[4:02:40] <+tomdwarf> No, I think the boat is just to transfer between dream areas.
[4:02:47] <%cobalt_phoenix_> tower
[4:02:48] <Visorak6> tower
[4:02:48] <%A_Zealous_Retort> ruined building passed on your right
[4:02:51] <cheapdoc> The tower?
[4:02:51] <Abyssal_Jaguar> The 2nd Tower!
[4:02:52] <+tomdwarf> This is dream tower
[4:02:55] <%G_Thunders> 4 sections of real world that all change when the dam breaks is hard enough to remember
[4:03:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> then cove, then bell
[4:03:04] <%A_Zealous_Retort> yeah this looks like starlit cove
[4:03:09] <teebos> i found using the focus helps a bit. works more like a flashlight
[4:03:27] <Visorak6> So the "pictures" are the location of all the bonfires yeah?
[4:03:27] <+tomdwarf> I imagine it rotates
[4:03:30] <%cobalt_phoenix_> probably loops back to swamp
[4:03:32] <Abyssal_Jaguar> We never went to the end!
[4:03:35] <%A_Zealous_Retort> maybe theres more, maybe it wraps around?
[4:03:38] <cheapdoc> logically you should loop, but who knows
[4:03:51] <leole11> everything in this game loops
[4:03:54] <leole11> even the game loops
[4:03:58] <jorniev> GAS GAS GAS
[4:04:00] <%A_Zealous_Retort> it showed the aliens entering the dream from inside the bell, im wondering if you can do that too
[4:04:01] <cheapdoc> logic eludes me in that dream
[4:04:07] <$ringabal> These truly are the Destiny Islands, Sora
[4:04:12] <hewwogames> even the water in the ringworld loops, which...how?
[4:04:35] <Abyssal_Jaguar> There go that damn
[4:04:35] <MartyFun11> The ring world is spinning to create gravity
[4:04:36] <bear_breaker20> its like a washing machine
[4:04:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sploosh
[4:04:38] <leole11> ok NOW the dam went
[4:04:40] <jorniev> there goes the damn
[4:04:41] <Irrepressible32TAL> moebius strip ass map
[4:04:44] <DigiLapin> splash splash wake up
[4:04:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> i don't know if thats right
[4:04:50] <hewwogames> oh...i dont know enough about physics to know if that's true
[4:05:03] <cheapdoc> Now that we know it loops, you could just raft wherever
[4:05:09] <nomos42> more accuratley, the ground it moving around the still water, i think?
[4:05:13] <%asgard147> wait, DOES IT GET RID OF THEM IN THE DREAM TOO?
[4:05:16] <%A_Zealous_Retort> should go to the tower in the canyon which doesnt get hit by the wave
[4:05:23] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Ride one against the current?
[4:05:26] <%Mattais88> What happens if you go to the swamp now though?
[4:05:26] <jorniev> did you ever meet the dude sitting watching the pictures?
[4:05:30] <TheRealNumberJ42> if you die in the dream you die for real
[4:05:34] <%A_Zealous_Retort> TURN OFF YOUR FLASHLIGHT
[4:05:35] <HiveMasterMind> Their soul flames get extinguished
[4:05:47] <%DrTomT18> shh
[4:05:51] <HibikiYamada> see if they stop patrolling now that their flames are gone
[4:05:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> hm now i wonder, does your body stay in the area you entered the dream  from, making it possible to stay in an area you normally couldn't dream in?
[4:05:54] <%stubborndeer> STAR DATE
[4:05:55] <Abyssal_Jaguar> try the thing in the bell?
[4:05:57] <%stubborndeer> 200000000000
[4:05:58] <hewwogames> i was just about to say, I think that flood kills them
[4:05:58] <cheapdoc> bell time?
[4:05:59] <+tomdwarf> Go to the bell?
[4:05:59] <atgithursdays> hey pat do you have to pay a lot of taxes being a streamer?
[4:06:00] <%stubborndeer> CAPTAINS LOG
[4:06:05] <leole11> the BELL
[4:06:07] <%stubborndeer> IM STILL ON A FUCKING RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
[4:06:20] <%DrTomT18> I think time moves slower in the Dream World
[4:06:21] <%stubborndeer> Entertainment taxwes are basically 0%
[4:06:34] <nomos42> I can't believe your not getting zapped
[4:06:40] <cheapdoc> Maybe the bell releases energy?
[4:06:42] <%AyotoCorp> Or maybe it's just because they were already electrified and now they're in water
[4:06:43] <%ape_hawk> wait, your water broke, pat?
[4:06:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> so was the dam meant to break on purpose?
[4:06:46] <+extantCadence> Pat that's just the water level rising
[4:06:48] <leole11> wood is a poor conductor
[4:06:48] <Abyssal_Jaguar> We saw part of a powersystem in the big tower in the 2nd zone. Could the water pushing it over break that?
[4:07:03] <vVAstrAVv> theyre electrified befo5its just theyre above water level
[4:07:03] <%bassoontyphoon> Man this is really well done but holy hell I hate this and it scares the bejeebus outta me
[4:07:03] <%cobalt_phoenix_> if they're already dead in the real world id say they don't get affected by a little water
[4:07:22] <leole11> big think
[4:07:24] <cheapdoc> nightmare time
[4:07:27] <TheRealNumberJ42> the flame goes out though when the water hits
[4:07:28] <Visorak6> So the reason the bell is kept underwater is so people cant sleep there?
[4:07:47] <%Mattais88> Satan?
[4:07:52] <Saltmeisterr> uh oh
[4:07:52] <%SveriSageAdvice> jesus christ
[4:07:52] <leole11> i refuse to believe they managed to get the vault inside the elevator
[4:07:55] <cheapdoc> MORE CONTENT
[4:08:11] <%A_Zealous_Retort> HOW BIG IS THIS DLC?
[4:08:11] <+BIumen> they really made a dlc bigger than the base game huh
[4:08:18] <%cobalt_phoenix_> open the coffin pat drink the juice
[4:08:18] <chaosbringer28> this dlc is a solid like 10 hours
[4:08:24] <cheapdoc> pat
[4:08:24] <leole11> ooooooooooooooooo
[4:08:24] <RyeBreadBakery> thiis dlc looks Big
[4:08:28] <%SirGO0SE> wow this zone is a lot more than I was expecting
[4:08:31] <TheRealNumberJ42> prince of darkness vibes
[4:08:33] <RyeBreadBakery> OOOOH
[4:08:36] <RyuuAoi> Devil summoner?
[4:08:37] <%Deadpal> it's pretty big
[4:08:43] <nomos42> oh shit, I never found that
[4:08:54] <RyeBreadBakery> i love the designs of these guys.... they're so cool
[4:09:00] <%stubborndeer> DONT PUT THAT HELMET ON
[4:09:02] <%stubborndeer> THAT'S THE TRAP
[4:09:07] <%stubborndeer> FUCK YOU RULES
[4:09:16] <%Frost_Quill> OH
[4:09:22] <%stubborndeer> There is more game than that fucking trap
[4:09:23] <leole11> HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
[4:09:24] <Abyssal_Jaguar> NO LIGHTS MEANS YOU CAN WALK THROUGH PAINTED WALLS
[4:09:24] <nomos42> oooooh
[4:09:26] <cheapdoc> wut
[4:09:27] <%stubborndeer> pls no ban
[4:09:29] <HibikiYamada> well then
[4:09:33] <%A_Zealous_Retort> but how do you turn the lights out
[4:09:40] <+Like51bears> watch that one twice
[4:09:42] <%DrTomT18> but how do you turn the lights off?
[4:09:51] <KasiCrafter> If you can't see them, it doesn't exist THIS AGAIN
[4:09:56] <+tomdwarf> Yeah, those lights turned off. Maybe events in dream tower will affect those lights?
[4:09:57] <%A_Zealous_Retort> wait ok so ALL images with the planet in them are portals?
[4:09:57] <%stubborndeer> Pat write down on a note and staple it to your hands so you don't forget : Do NOT put on that fucking helmet
[4:09:58] <%G_Thunders> Probably should watch it again
[4:10:04] <AoiRob> wait for the tower to get hit?
[4:10:08] <chaosbringer28> maybe investigate its pair in the dream world
[4:10:11] <cheapdoc> Their eyes are black
[4:10:17] <nomos42> I think he just used his psychic powers
[4:10:20] <%Frost_Quill> Do the lights turn off when the tower gets hit with water?
[4:10:21] <jorniev> i think this sequence also had the password?
[4:10:22] <cheapdoc> but they have light then
[4:10:27] <%A_Zealous_Retort> and this one showed the three circle thing so theres probably other visions nearby with fucky shit about the other two towers
[4:10:31] <%tactician0> oh I see now
[4:10:33] <%Monkeyweed21> what if you were in that room when it gets knocked over
[4:10:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> These 8mm rotoscope fuckin moments are kind of a mind fuck
[4:10:43] <leole11> dude just chilling there, the lights go out by themselves?
[4:10:43] <+tomdwarf> I think its trying to show that there are things you can do in dream tower to turn those lights off. His friend is leaving to turn those lamps off.
[4:10:43] <jubejube56> Could wait for the tower to get hit, but the deer man seems to do something with the artifact which then causes the lights to go out
[4:10:45] <genmypoweralready> He motioned to wait while he left
[4:10:51] <mr_saturday93> so super Mario 64 shit?
[4:10:51] <%asgard147> water
[4:10:52] <%DrTomT18> you do?
[4:10:52] <ZE_Count> jump in water
[4:10:55] <%A_Zealous_Retort> jump in the water?
[4:10:55] <%DrTomT18> what?
[4:10:56] <nomos42> water
[4:11:00] <%DrTomT18> jump in the water
[4:11:01] <%Frost_Quill> Oh how convenient.
[4:11:02] <jorniev> wake up then sleep again?
[4:11:02] <cheapdoc> THATS EVIL
[4:11:02] <%DrTomT18> or do that
[4:11:07] <ZE_Count> lol in rings the bell
[4:11:16] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Tower is underwater! New Loop Tactical Suicide!
[4:11:20] <KasiCrafter> Supernova time?
[4:11:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the tower is probably collapsed right now
[4:11:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> huh, an alarm system to prevent people from going where they dont want them to
[4:11:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh lmao i wakes you up by loud noise
[4:11:31] <$ringabal> Full Moxie, let's go

[4:11:47] <HibikiYamada> you're so dead lmao
[4:11:49] <RyuuAoi> Beat sunshine yesterday. Boy was that game not as good as I remembered

[4:12:06] <vVAstrAVv> yeah the rapids PULL you under lol
[4:12:08] <nomos42> yee
[4:12:09] <+Like51bears> raft is my new best friend
[4:12:10] <leole11> the amount of security concerns to not let ANYONE in the vault is ridiculous
[4:12:11] <%ape_hawk> ah beans
[4:12:16] <HibikiYamada> RAAAAFT
[4:12:23] <cheapdoc> Raft go BRRRR
[4:12:28] <$ringabal> Ride Raft. Life Good.

[4:13:13] <genmypoweralready> Potassium
[4:13:15] <vVAstrAVv> other side
[4:13:19] <%bassoontyphoon> psaDab
[4:13:22] <%stubborndeer> Pat If you keep that raft you can turn it into a fucking mech
[4:13:24] <chaosbringer28> no
[4:13:27] <leole11> you already saw that reel btw
[4:13:29] <%DrTomT18> oh, I guess that's true
[4:13:29] <Abyssal_Jaguar> OOOOO
[4:13:31] <chaosbringer28> try the other version of this tower
[4:13:31] <cholesteroid> Potassium
[4:13:31] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Smart!
[4:13:33] <KasiCrafter> Try not to die when the tower falls
[4:13:36] <$ringabal> Be a real shame if pat died here
[4:13:37] <%walternatorz> cutting it close
[4:13:41] <%stubborndeer> Also there is a dog hidden on this island
[4:13:43] <+twohitgood> ....
[4:13:45] <nomos42> or not
[4:13:45] <%G_Thunders> Big Brain!
[4:13:47] <leole11> hmmmmm
[4:13:47] <+tomdwarf> I dont think thats it
[4:13:48] <%Valdorick> They'll what?
[4:13:48] <TheRealNumberJ42> nice idea but
[4:13:49] <+Like51bears> you know i thought the same thing, its a shame it doesn;t
[4:13:49] <HibikiYamada> welp
[4:13:51] <biggswedg3> @chaosbringer28 ban this guy
[4:13:52] <FleshFriend> hmm
[4:13:53] <leole11> smol brain?
[4:13:54] <%Mr_Pylon> twas a good try
[4:13:56] <%A_Zealous_Retort> well it was a good thought
[4:13:58] <%SirGO0SE> psaCrazyhead
[4:13:59] <%Axellogic> lights too strong
[4:13:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> also how would you get in?
[4:14:03] <DianaTheAscian> damn it
[4:14:03] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Dream dead
[4:14:04] <vVAstrAVv> bitch u THOUGHT lol
[4:14:04] <RyuuAoi> Lies
[4:14:04] <teebos> damn those are some future lights
[4:14:06] <HibikiYamada> definitely something in the guarded area
[4:14:06] <jubejube56> More likely that you need to do something in the dream world at this location
[4:14:07] <cheapdoc> There was a slider
[4:14:07] <RyeBreadBakery> i think you need to cut the lights yourself maybe?
[4:14:08] <leole11> did paige die?
[4:14:08] <%asgard147> limesS
[4:14:08] <HiveMasterMind> but the power does flicker
[4:14:09] <nomos42> I think the vision was a broader hint
[4:14:10] <chaosbringer28> rip lights too strong
[4:14:12] <RyuuAoi> Nice attempt though
[4:14:12] <ZE_Count> you were cool tho pat
[4:14:13] <%Mattais88> Generator somewhere/
[4:14:17] <$ringabal> What a powerful adversary
[4:14:19] <%walternatorz> the guy who walked out seemingly turned the lights off
[4:14:23] <%MrUnKnownAlien> maybe because he has the relic
[4:14:28] <+tomdwarf> My assumption is that you need to do some stuff in dream tower that will affect real tower, such as turning off those lights.
[4:14:28] <%A_Zealous_Retort> maybe you need to figure out the power issues thing to cut power to the lights
[4:14:32] <leole11> ok but WHERE
[4:14:35] <%buerdo> bet there's something upstairs
[4:14:37] <genmypoweralready> He left with the relic
[4:14:38] <%stubborndeer> Rememeber, Water dissapates charge to dirt, and dirt blocks charge from wood!
[4:14:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> acquire lightswitch
[4:14:44] <%DrTomT18> that might world
[4:14:47] <%asgard147> is the power on when you first arrive?
[4:14:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> i really wish you could check your log without your ship esp since you're not able to get to it in this dlc
[4:14:49] <Abyssal_Jaguar> If only there were some solar panels you could break?
[4:14:50] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> Just flick the light switch
[4:14:50] <KasiCrafter> Come to think of it, that other birdman was out only a LITTLE bit before the lights shut off
[4:14:53] <+twohitgood> the guy walked out with an artifact and turned the lights out. i'm expecting he probably did something elsewhere.
[4:14:56] <jubejube56> He walked out with the relic and told you to wait, then after a bit the lights go out
[4:15:03] <%SirGO0SE> the lights is out
[4:15:07] <%bassoontyphoon> Pat you need to “close the lights”
[4:15:18] <%A_Zealous_Retort> lol imagine if the solution is to just ram your ship into the solar panels
[4:15:19] <vVAstrAVv> you may want to explore the hidden gorge for CONVENIENCE
[4:15:22] <%MrUnKnownAlien> yea he left with the relic and the lights went out
[4:15:33] <ExpressNode> Subterranean cake
[4:15:42] <%stubborndeer> @twohitgood If electricity can be turned off by creating resistance on a metal circuit line or by cutting the line, then how do you turn off torches in open air
[4:16:00] <%DrTomT18> me too man
[4:16:04] <%Valdorick> ... Doesn't the power flicker when the system goes to solar power?
[4:16:13] <leole11> @PatStaresAt you can view rumors on the arrows, too
[4:16:16] <%Mattais88> Maybe the light is connected to the murals in the room above?
[4:16:30] <Abyssal_Jaguar> were there more stairs?
[4:16:31] <cheapdoc> So ... you just gotta do it really fast?
[4:16:40] <nomos42> what!
[4:16:44] <vVAstrAVv> marker gone
[4:17:14] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Were there not more stairs, you had to view that slide deck on something
[4:17:16] <%jtdobyns> dang, when will we get the language
[4:17:23] <%Ne1son> Power flickers for a bit right
[4:17:26] <cheapdoc> 699 viewers, nice
[4:17:27] <Visorak6> Maybe you have to prevent the slats from opening?
[4:17:30] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the vault that gave you the vision had the three circles icon, are there other vaults in the subterranean place that will give you different visions?
[4:17:33] <%Ne1son> when the slats open
[4:17:40] <%jtdobyns> Language is red haring?
[4:17:50] <%A_Zealous_Retort> nice parking job
[4:17:55] <jorniev> TIME TO CUT THE POWER
[4:17:57] <KasiCrafter> Is a flicker all you need?
[4:17:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> maybe its a clue tho
[4:17:57] <vVAstrAVv> the language honestly isnt important
[4:18:08] <cholesteroid> nother happy landing
[4:18:17] <%Monkeyweed21> the alien did something with an artifact on the roof
[4:18:39] <genmypoweralready> Shadow realm
[4:18:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> finish off all those Thor 2's
[4:18:41] <%A_Zealous_Retort> you still have a real world location to explore too
[4:18:41] <Slimeking_Mike> The language appears to mostly signify locations rather than knowledge
[4:18:41] <cureneckbeard> emlo
[4:18:42] <%Mattais88> hwta if you open the coffin?
[4:18:46] <leole11> he went left, that's downstairs
[4:19:16] <time2getsweaty> Pat! you're playing one of my favorite games of the last decade : D
[4:19:17] <+emperri> shit, I can't fuck
[4:19:21] <Medo3G> Didn’t you get woken up by a red thing that made noise at some point
[4:19:40] <vVAstrAVv> pat you REEEEALLY dont have to move the lanterns so damn far lol
[4:19:51] <cheapdoc> You got like 85 seconds
[4:20:14] <cheapdoc> Before the first crack
[4:20:21] <leole11> lmao
[4:20:24] <%Monkeyweed21> until Des
[4:20:25] <+emperri> dunno
[4:20:25] <%A_Zealous_Retort> @cheapdoc from dam to tower collapse?
[4:20:25] <%stubborndeer> PAT STOP MOVING
[4:20:28] <leole11> that happened to me several times
[4:20:29] <%stubborndeer> IT's the AIR
[4:20:33] <%stubborndeer> Your pushing the AIR around
[4:20:38] <%stubborndeer> when you break surface tension
[4:20:41] <atgithursdays> before your butt explode
[4:21:08] <+emperri> do it live
[4:21:08] <cheapdoc> @cheapdoc to tower leaning, you get a lean, and the town goes down, then you get a few more seconds before the tower itself goes down
[4:21:10] <%stubborndeer> The surface tension of water decides the possible charge total
[4:21:16] <spinningchurro> can someone tell me how far into the game he is?  1st stream?
[4:21:20] <%stubborndeer> and every time you break it the electricity can transfer
[4:21:23] <$ringabal> Space churches don't really do well, just ask the God Emperor
[4:21:37] <Visorak6> Are you expecting one of the signs to translate to "gun that kills the eye access" or something
[4:21:42] <KasiCrafter> Imagine if that writing was just graffiti which was the birdman equivalent of dickbutt
[4:21:45] <%kraken_lab> wait why are we talking surface area and charge?
[4:21:45] <genmypoweralready> all the writing is just slurs and xbox live quotes
[4:21:45] <Saltmeisterr> wtf are you talking about @stubborndeer
[4:21:46] <cheapdoc> The percentage of integrity of the damn goes down every second or 1.5 seconds
[4:21:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> im willing to bet that if the language does eventually get obtained for the translator, those symbols literally tell you everything you need to know
[4:21:56] <leole11> @Visorak6 it'd be a nice change of pace
[4:22:07] <%RetroCop87> yo, is this PatStaresAt or BackseatGamersAt?
[4:22:14] <cureneckbeard> BackseatGamersAt
[4:22:20] <%Frost_Quill> we still don't know what the nightmare singing thing was
[4:22:21] <chaosbringer28> the dam doesnt start breaking until the solar panels/sails open btw so he does have a grace period
[4:22:25] <vVAstrAVv> i appreciate that btw :3
[4:22:25] <+emperri> not this shit again
[4:22:32] <%A_Zealous_Retort> BackseatPastaRat
[4:22:32] <cheapdoc> Where the backseatgamers at
[4:22:33] <%stubborndeer> @Saltmeisterr The space station is recieving electrical charge from solar panels and there are only limited capacitors so eventually the glass will crack, or if the circuit changes, the trees will catch fire
[4:22:40] <Uselesswhitenoise> Pat get the banana
[4:22:40] <%stubborndeer> this game has a physics system
[4:22:51] <cheapdoc> big chonky bois

[4:23:57] <DianaTheAscian> They're not wrong though
[4:23:59] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Birussy?
[4:23:59] <%DrTomT18> Pat didn't you come here to go into the hidden study
[4:24:00] <%thedankestmeeme> Horny bonk go to horny jail
[4:24:01] <+SpareKeese> Can't stop, won't stop
[4:24:02] <Slimeking_Mike> Y'know what they say about aliens with big mouths.
[4:24:04] <RyuuAoi> It's okay to be a big hot dude, Pat.
[4:24:04] <cheapdoc> But plague is streaming danganronpa 2 and ... its danganronpa 2
[4:24:07] <Uselesswhitenoise> You know who was a real hottie? the space angler fish
[4:24:08] <Slimeking_Mike> they can eat more food
[4:24:09] <vVAstrAVv> go to horny vault
[4:24:11] <atgithursdays> itll never stop
[4:24:12] <%Frost_Quill> @Agami23 They might not be dudes, we can't tell they might be owldeer ladies.
[4:24:15] <$ringabal> But I thought Pat was part of the Bird Squad
[4:24:20] <thehornypastrypuffer> "hooo noooo keep that outta here" he said
[4:24:20] <%ape_hawk> do the bird-deer dudes have dongs or corkscrews?
[4:24:21] <chaosbringer28> pats getting better and geting candles
[4:24:23] <leole11> what DO they say about aliens with big mouths?
[4:24:24] <+emperri> still hate it
[4:24:24] <HibikiYamada> god this shit's so fucking weird
[4:24:30] <cureneckbeard> haruchiHueagh
[4:24:51] <%stubborndeer> @PatStaresAt Oh also don't teleport ever, EVER unless you are keeping track of your teleports so you can do it backwards
[4:24:53] <atgithursdays> if rats can't swim then owls are hot it's the law
[4:24:54] <%Valdorick> Yes, Pat's pure good boy stream would never be tainted by filth like that. This is a mom and dad channel, involving cumhazzard, and bussy
[4:24:54] <%thedankestmeeme> @leole11 Idk they chew louder?
[4:24:56] <leole11> those hands give me the creeps
[4:24:57] <hewwogames> :)
[4:24:59] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand you can’t tell me not to watch furries playing crash team racing
[4:25:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> I imagine being one of those aliens is just like tripping balls 24/7
[4:25:05] <leole11> @thedankestmeeme LMAO
[4:25:05] <cheapdoc> From all the fucking designs they could've chosen for a teleporter, why the fuck did they chose a hand?
[4:25:07] <spinningchurro> that’s a great effect
[4:25:10] <@Ranryu692> Owls ARE hot; have you seen Mumei?
[4:25:13] <TheRealNumberJ42> floormaster ptsd
[4:25:16] <%Agami23> @Frost_Quill they are big af and seem pretty strong, so i dont care what gender they are.
[4:25:22] <chaosbringer28> because the hand catches you
[4:25:31] <%kraken_lab> @cheapdoc hand pulls you in
[4:25:31] <leole11> stupid bridge
[4:25:34] <Abyssal_Jaguar> It can see light
[4:25:37] <jubejube56> They can see you when you are around light
[4:25:38] <%bravebravesrobin> bravebravesrobin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! 8 months; hooray.  Pat, I've heard for years that you hate spoilers, and so do I, to an extent.  What's your view on being spoiled, but still being interested to see how the narrative fully unfolds to explain said spoiler(s)?
[4:25:38] <Visorak6> its the light
[4:25:40] <HibikiYamada> is it seeing you?
[4:25:40] <%rkbinder> Its light

[4:25:45] <%Valdorick> DED
[4:25:46] <hewwogames> 0 for 2
[4:25:51] <%asgard147> you can only walk across in darkness
[4:25:52] <vVAstrAVv> oh no light

[4:26:13] <+WutangchickeN> wutang6CHAMP wutang6CHAMP wutang6CHAMP
[4:26:15] <+SpareKeese> Pat getting owned by water
[4:26:16] <genmypoweralready> Just do it perfect
[4:26:17] <Visorak6> Youre missing some way to extinguish the box lights
[4:26:21] <ZE_Count> jse the power of darkness
[4:26:23] <jubejube56> Shoulda just called the DLC "it's about flashlights"
[4:26:23] <cheapdoc> Bright bramble
[4:26:37] <ZE_Count> ALAN WAKE IT PAT!
[4:26:40] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Look at the water around it? maybe some unlit jumping puzzle?
[4:26:52] <leole11> Outer Wilds: Use The Light, isn't that attractive of a title
[4:26:53] <DigiLapin> will the pong claim pats life a 3rd time?
[4:26:54] <cheapdoc> This a Souls game now?
[4:26:58] <%A_Zealous_Retort> can you put the artifact down in here?
[4:27:08] <IzanagiNoOokami> Stick your fingers in your ear and go "Lalala I can't hear you" to evade the bell.
[4:27:11] <vVAstrAVv> its not THAT dark soulsey lol
[4:27:15] <%drabberfaun535> defense mechanics implies they have had intruders before.
[4:27:25] <+redyoshi5> its the lights
[4:27:26] <mustachegolem> thats sadly not useful
[4:27:26] <%Frost_Quill> oh the bird guys can't send you back I guess???
[4:27:39] <Visorak6> if you go across quick enough?
[4:27:43] <leole11> ok but what now
[4:27:46] <RyuuAoi> But what if he loses it forever when he puts it down?
[4:27:59] <%Agami23> mad dash to jump down the pit?
[4:28:00] <%stubborndeer> A cup of coffee will help, with milk
[4:28:02] <$ringabal> Sprint?
[4:28:09] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Unlit jumping puzze?
[4:28:16] <%Agami23> oh it slows you, damn
[4:28:19] <HibikiYamada> it slows you down too doesn't it
[4:28:21] <TheRealNumberJ42> yes you are :)
[4:28:26] <%cobalt_phoenix_> need timestop
[4:28:26] <leole11> maybe try a different location?
[4:28:32] <chaosbringer28> maybe explore other places see if you can find things
[4:28:36] <+extantCadence> @drabberfaun535 Or that they're just really paranoid
[4:28:38] <vVAstrAVv> you are
[4:28:40] <jorniev> can you drop it inside the dream?
[4:28:44] <+emperri> this will all be solved when he gets timestop
[4:28:44] <DigiLapin> what about the secret room?
[4:28:45] <Kosinkadink> were you gonna try going to the tower in the dark world thingy?
[4:28:45] <cheapdoc> These doods have to be the napping CHAMPIONS, I can't imagine they never banged those bells by accident
[4:28:47] <%DrTomT18> Didn't you come here to see if you could open the secret passage in the dream world?
[4:28:53] <%A_Zealous_Retort> remembering how you extinguished the door in the dream what if you can extinguish the lanterns
[4:28:54] <$ringabal> God, do we really have to go back to the nightmare music house?
[4:28:55] <Abyssal_Jaguar> Go back to the roof?
[4:28:56] <%kraken_lab> Man I can't wait until he beats the game and unlocks timestop in newgame+
[4:28:57] <HibikiYamada> watching water flow up is so fucking weird.
[4:29:04] <%cobalt_phoenix_> just put on some earplugs before going to sleep Kappa
[4:29:04] <jubejube56> I'd say to go to the hidden gorge but it might be flooded by now?
[4:29:08] <chaosbringer28> you still have stuff to explore in the dream area you left
[4:29:15] <MartyFun11> You never went to the dream world version of that room though
[4:29:16] <%SirGO0SE> oh man I wonder what happens if he puts it down then gets caught by the guard.
[4:29:18] <ZE_Count> this is not a small dlc
[4:29:32] <leole11> dream areas are hard to "complete"
[4:29:32] <cholesteroid> Nightmare music house
[4:29:33] <%Agami23> imagine how fucking wild the concept of a flashlight would be to these big owl boys
[4:29:34] <chaosbringer28> the one you just left
[4:29:35] <+extantCadence> @cobalt_phoenix_ Kappa
[4:29:37] <vVAstrAVv> you can actually you just dont know where
[4:29:37] <%DrTomT18> the alarm isn't the only way forward, you never explored the house you created
[4:29:38] <cheapdoc> BIG CHONKY DLC
[4:29:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt wasnt there a version of that painting in the dream world
[4:29:43] <%A_Zealous_Retort> it looked like it was some stairs down, Im wondering if thats an EXIT from the subterranean dream in the bell
[4:29:45] <%AyotoCorp> This DLC is like 1/3 the size of the base game by itself I think
[4:29:56] <cheapdoc> BIG WAVE
[4:29:58] <HibikiYamada> guess what broke lol
[4:29:58] <$ringabal> RAFT FIGHT BACK
[4:29:59] <ZE_Count> we rafting!
[4:30:02] <raikagelord1> Pat still enjoying the game?
[4:30:03] <RyuuAoi> REKT
[4:30:06] <ZilverZap> saved
[4:30:08] <chaosbringer28> hang 10 dude
[4:30:08] <+SpareKeese> woa
[4:30:11] <%jtdobyns> well nvm haha
[4:30:34] <hewwogames> cowabunga
[4:30:35] <%jtdobyns> never fully explored this place? idk
[4:30:44] <chaosbringer28> i think the wave occurs half-way into the cycle
[4:30:49] <cheapdoc> you have around an extra minute, minute thirty give and take
[4:30:51] <hewwogames> pat you gotta hit that fresh gnar-gnar next loop
[4:31:00] <%Monkeyweed21> no you didnt
[4:31:10] <RyeBreadBakery> man this is so cool
[4:31:14] <+extantCadence> Dam breaking is maybe halfway through the loop or so
[4:31:14] <chaosbringer28> you didnt fully explore the real version
[4:31:18] <+Like51bears> pat you literally went in 1 house here lmao
[4:31:22] <%Monkeyweed21> the log still has stuff for the real world
[4:31:29] <TheRealNumberJ42> explored like 1 house lmao
[4:31:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:31:34] <%Monkeyweed21> IT DIDNT
[4:31:37] <chaosbringer28> did it? i thought the log was still orange last time you went
[4:31:43] <%Monkeyweed21> IT SAID THE OPPOSITE
[4:31:48] <jubejube56> praise ship log
[4:31:48] <ZE_Count> did you get to the place with the broken bridge in the real world?
[4:31:49] <TheRealNumberJ42> crazy talk is acting up
[4:31:51] <jubejube56> the great equalizer
[4:31:53] <vVAstrAVv> theres other stuff in the real version thats whole other areas
[4:31:55] <chaosbringer28> hidden gorge was still orange i thought
[4:31:56] <%DrTomT18> no, there was still an orange dot and that 'there is more to find here' dude
[4:31:58] <Medo3G> Chill guys
[4:32:03] <RyuuAoi> He's been here. What a mansion!
[4:32:06] <cheapdoc> Are we having a one guy moment?
[4:32:06] <%jtdobyns> oh yah gotta find out where that music is coming from
[4:32:11] <r0dneyjenkins> how do you stare at something for so long Pat ?
[4:32:21] <Visorak6> Thats right theres a sentry at the bottom of this place that got you
[4:32:24] <chaosbringer28> in the real world, not the dream world many people mean
[4:32:29] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I think you can go through that other side of the wall, to get to the place with the broken bridge
[4:32:41] <TG_Cid11> @r0dneyjenkins its easy after you get over the dry eyes
[4:32:49] <%Agami23> i really like the aesthetic of this freak ass dream world. except the weird trees
[4:32:53] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @r0dneyjenkins Years of staring into the Woolie hole
[4:32:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> did he ever manage to see whoever is casting the shadow?
[4:32:58] <raikagelord1> Did he go down the river in the dream world?
[4:32:58] <teebos> UHH
[4:33:06] <chaosbringer28> yea he did
[4:33:12] <r0dneyjenkins> @TG_Cid11 lol
[4:33:21] <%A_Zealous_Retort> yeah theres a living one watching the tele down there
[4:33:23] <%DrTomT18> Guess the Owls really liked it in the dark
[4:33:36] <%DrTomT18> they probably have night vision
[4:33:38] <r0dneyjenkins> @NigelSchnauzerpug the Woolie hole ... ? wut ?
[4:33:42] <%A_Zealous_Retort> the hands having branching fingers is fucking with me
[4:33:45] <nomos42> you never went down actually
[4:33:48] <nomos42> in the mansion
[4:33:54] <cheapdoc> I would be so anxious playing this game, this stream is the best way for me to experience this
[4:33:56] <leole11> the hand is AWFUL
[4:33:57] <%DrTomT18> @r0dneyjenkins Oh. you must be new.
[4:33:58] <chaosbringer28> i thought he did
[4:34:07] <ZE_Count> creepy trees
[4:34:08] <raikagelord1> He never found the Owl man of there is one.
[4:34:09] <kaze7897> There is another route
[4:34:19] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @r0dneyjenkins It's probably best you don't know about the Woolie Hole
[4:34:33] <nomos42> oh wait, yeh u did sry
[4:34:33] <Visorak6> Yeah I remember a sentry here
[4:34:35] <leole11> cute mural again :)
[4:34:39] <cheapdoc> it's the same tree innit?
[4:34:46] <%DrTomT18> Pat, this isn't the same room.
[4:34:48] <%Frost_Quill> can you go in the water if you aren't holding the artifact?
[4:34:52] <ZilverZap> Whatever you do, never let woolie see your balls
[4:34:54] <chaosbringer28> do you know or remember turning any of those lamps off?
[4:34:58] <raikagelord1> Oh yeah this thing.
[4:34:59] <+tomdwarf> Last time, you needed a lookie hole to turn lamps off, similar to you making those bridges.
[4:35:00] <r0dneyjenkins> @DrTomT18 first time watching stream. I've watched the best friends play for some time though
[4:35:07] <%A_Zealous_Retort> need to use the lightswitches to turn off the lanterns near the door
[4:35:07] <%Agami23> that tree looks liek the one from nioh 2
[4:35:08] <chaosbringer28> or lamps like them
[4:35:08] <jorniev> talk to the dude?
[4:35:09] <r0dneyjenkins> @NigelSchnauzerpug that bad ?
[4:35:15] <+emperri> whats that sound like a snoring cow
[4:35:20] <cheapdoc> @ZilverZap I dunno man, it's a free shave
[4:35:25] <vVAstrAVv> geif scarier than game
[4:35:28] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @r0dneyjenkins old best friends lore about woolie
[4:35:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> thats Zangief snorin
[4:35:31] <raikagelord1> Open the door and then some kind of light shines on it????
[4:35:34] <leole11> bro, this game would end faster if the alien could just stomp on the lanterns

[4:35:47] <%RetroCop87> better than a poopy snorey
[4:35:50] <%SirGO0SE> oh my God I thought that was the game
[4:35:54] <+emperri> I thought that was spooky game audio
[4:35:59] <%MrUnKnownAlien> maybe having the relic turns the lights on and not having it in the room makes them turn off?
[4:36:01] <vVAstrAVv> no we like snorey poopy
[4:36:02] <+WutangchickeN> the dog snoring adds ambiance not going to lie
[4:36:05] <nomos42> @jorniev not yet
[4:36:05] <chaosbringer28> i think this area you have fully explored, the real world area its linked too I thought was still unfinished
[4:36:28] <vVAstrAVv> was that a dog fart?
[4:36:33] <%DrTomT18> I thought the snoring was in game  from like, an Owl Person lmao
[4:36:33] <%chiazam> I feel like it’s been a half hour since Pat learnt anything really cool

[4:37:12] <chaosbringer28> mark something that is orange, never lets you down
[4:37:13] <%DrTomT18> how long do you plan on streaming?
[4:37:16] <nomos42> That dreamworld was the one i figured out last
[4:37:17] <%The_0_2_Hero> Oh him loud baby
[4:37:17] <%stubborndeer> What the fuck is that Neon Chicken doing following you around
[4:37:18] <%RetroCop87> maybe sleep on it?
[4:37:18] <Abyssal_Jaguar> I have no idea the were we are in the story, but damn I love all the mysteries being laid out
[4:37:22] <raikagelord1> That’s fair.
[4:37:24] <Visorak6> So the scream is when the flood "kills" those searching dudes?
[4:37:28] <leole11> it didn't sound like the dam broke
[4:37:33] <KasiCrafter> I thought the whole gimmik behind the dream world was blowing and lighting stuff up through those wooden posts
[4:37:39] <raikagelord1> @abyssal_jaguar I just love this game in general.
[4:37:41] <%DrTomT18> You should look around the hidden gorge more
[4:37:41] <cheapdoc> The dam broke once
[4:37:48] <+SpareKeese> @hibikiyamada @visorak6 ooooh, you might be right
[4:37:52] <chaosbringer28> your right on the edge of liek 2 or 3 important things, just have to put a foot in the right spot somewhere
[4:37:56] <chaosbringer28> told ya
[4:37:56] <spinningchurro> I fully expect the story in this one to pale in comparison to the first, but I’m hoping the gameplay makes up for it.
[4:37:56] <+extantCadence> Pat I think you’re exploring a world-sized Give Up Machine
[4:37:57] <%SirGO0SE> one more lore, as a treat
[4:38:12] <vVAstrAVv> we know all
[4:38:29] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> @r0dneyjenkins wasn't a joke that could always be made, and usually just a quick "go down the woolie hole" and then they moved on.
[4:38:40] <cheapdoc> cliffside building?
[4:38:44] <%AyotoCorp> That's a lie
[4:38:53] <DianaTheAscian> cool
[4:38:55] <%Valdorick> Not so endless is it, huh?
[4:38:58] <%kraken_lab> @extantCadence give up machine?
[4:38:58] <%Deadpal> for now
[4:39:03] <chaosbringer28> yes
[4:39:05] <%Deadpal> for UNTIL COLLEGE.
[4:39:08] <%Monkeyweed21> you dont know what you're even missin yet
[4:39:09] <%stubborndeer> I can already tell you're fuckinglow on oxygen
[4:39:15] <leole11> more like canyon that ends lmao
[4:39:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> very finite canyon
[4:39:17] <cheapdoc> fully hullwugged
[4:39:19] <chaosbringer28> when the orange appears it means areas you can physically reach with current knowledge
[4:39:21] <%Valdorick> @extantCadence Suicide pact.
[4:39:41] <r0dneyjenkins> @NigelSchnauzerpug either way sounds like a fun time bein in the Woolie hole
[4:39:48] <raikagelord1> @chaosbringer28 makes sense and yeah so that means for now.
[4:40:01] <nomos42> wooooo
[4:40:03] <chaosbringer28> i think it likes to add notes to area if something new gets added later
[4:40:30] <HeroSolaire> ITS GOES DOWN
[4:40:38] <spinningchurro> GOIN DOWN THE TAFT FEELIING BAD
[4:40:40] <leole11> it DO go down
[4:40:42] <+Lokibringer> this level design where you can see the raft paths is just brilliant
[4:40:45] <r0dneyjenkins> is this the ring from Halo that you're boating on
[4:40:48] <cheapdoc> About as Lovecraftian as it gets
[4:40:51] <%DrTomT18> THIS MUSIC THOU
[4:40:55] <vVAstrAVv> they cant help it that theyre creepy
[4:41:00] <%A_Zealous_Retort> OH MY GOD i JUST REALIZED THE DREAM IS DARK AF BECAUSE THEY ARE OWLS AND HAVE NIGHTVISION
[4:41:04] <%Deadpal> this dlc is what I wanted halo infinte to be.
[4:41:04] <chaosbringer28> i was suprised how satisfing it was to control those rafts, a control method like that never seems to work in games
[4:41:08] <vVAstrAVv> THEYRE OWLS lol
[4:41:10] <%Frost_Quill> you never went near whatever was singing I think
[4:41:16] <cheapdoc> what about dark bramble?
[4:41:21] <%ape_hawk> dark bramble was pretty LC
[4:41:27] <%NigelSchnauzerpug> When's the fish people?
[4:41:30] <jorniev> are the owl guys trying to kill the eye?
[4:41:39] <KasiCrafter> Hey wait. This is just the spooky version of CEOs uploading themselves as AIs to attain immortality >:T
[4:41:44] <%DrTomT18> @NigelSchnauzerpug YOU are the fish people!
[4:41:44] <ZE_Count> its a big area
[4:41:47] <%Valdorick> Oh wait yeah, they're singing and have instruments... just like when you remake the universe.
[4:41:48] <+tomdwarf> The fact that you can astrally project into the dreamscape and live there even when your physical body dies is crazy awesome
[4:41:48] <@StridentSong> 7 raiders from StridentSong have joined! 
[4:41:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @jorniev not sure, but they sure don't like it
[4:41:55] <%Frost_Quill> @NigelSchnauzerpug main character is a fish person
[4:41:58] <%stubborndeer> @jorniev My favorite theory is that they ar the ones that failed
[4:41:59] <chaosbringer28> i also really like how their info is conveyed in video instead of the notes

[4:42:43] <RyuuAoi> Superstar Saga is best
[4:42:44] <%Monkeyweed21> the paper mario crossover one is prolly the worst
[4:42:45] <%stubborndeer> Mariop and luigi partners in time thethe best game ever made in the entire universe and you are all wrong
[4:42:48] <%Profmcstevie> How could pasta pizza in time miss so much when the first nailed so much
[4:42:48] <Saltmeisterr> @Yamchadassist n o
[4:42:51] <%kraken_lab> Partners in time has too many nested action commands

[4:42:58] <%bassoontyphoon> More like Bowsers inside Vore-ey
[4:42:59] <%Aeoneth> Superstar Saga is still my favorite of all tho
[4:43:02] <%notsoy> the italian gibberish and bowser's characterization are the best things the mario series has had in a while

[4:51:00] <jubejube56> oh maybe that temple has unburnt film or something
[4:51:00] <+NopeBadguy> You said "ten years ago I woulda thought that" like you didn't just think about it NOW
[4:51:07] <%Frost_Quill> mark the breach?
[4:51:09] <%SirGO0SE> I drank out of one of those at a party!
[4:51:11] <%DrTomT18> MARK THE HULL BREACH
[4:51:15] <RyuuAoi> Just shove pints in your underwears, cowards!
[4:51:16] <%Profmcstevie> If only such innovation would be spent elsewhere, man could be decades ahead by now
[4:51:17] <%Valdorick> Hull Breach deez nutz
[4:51:18] <chaosbringer28> 2nd spoke, clockwise from hanger
[4:51:25] <Visorak6> Top left
[4:51:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> it was more like 11:14
[4:51:44] <yodajr99> weirdest thing ever happened to me this morning, I was awoken by pat and paige on tv on the ridiculousness show, pat woke me up with his legendary quote "hey Paige's mom videogames gave me this house I bang your daughter in"
[4:51:57] <%Valdorick> wait, has pat even TRIED to walk on the hull?
[4:51:58] <ZE_Count> got to look hard
[4:52:06] <%A_Zealous_Retort> can you land on the exterior
[4:52:09] <nomos42> Flying is a fuck here
[4:52:11] <hewwogames> hole?
[4:52:15] <%A_Zealous_Retort> or on the spoke near the breach
[4:52:17] <akitanito> fly in?
[4:52:19] <chaosbringer28> word of warning, the floor is the light post, not the circle
[4:52:27] <RyuuAoi> Make it happen?
[4:52:31] <%DrTomT18> no, its long standing.
[4:52:31] <leole11> how can it occur in time if the reel was made?
[4:52:36] <%Frost_Quill> wait why did they have video of it happening if it hasn't happened yet?
[4:52:48] <cheapdoc> Is that why the green thing starts spinning?
[4:52:53] <chaosbringer28> cause of spin
[4:52:55] <%Frost_Quill> oh nevermind i'm stupid lol
[4:52:59] <AoiRob> got off your ship and check it
[4:53:00] <ZE_Count> spinning
[4:53:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> floor strats
[4:53:07] <chaosbringer28> i crashed twice because of that
[4:53:07] <akitanito> big smart
[4:53:08] <cureneckbeard> you did it
[4:53:09] <ZilverZap> all this time there was a fuckin hole in the ship
[4:53:16] <DianaTheAscian> wow
[4:53:23] <nomos42> close the door
[4:53:25] <%Valdorick> Oh, its, one of the communial chambers.
[4:53:27] <vVAstrAVv> enjoy more shortcut
[4:53:57] <WhoIsVesta> No knowledge. Just cheese.
[4:53:59] <jorniev> LAMP
[4:54:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait is that what you're supposed to use to learn how to go in, lmao
[4:54:07] <chaosbringer28> yea i didnt discover this until WAY late as well
[4:54:10] <cheapdoc> Maybe it's a way to show you can get in from here?
[4:54:11] <ZilverZap> no fires anywhere tho
[4:54:13] <RyuuAoi> He took a nap...
[4:54:14] <FleshFriend> prototype dream projection
[4:54:29] <yodajr99> sleep lamp
[4:54:29] <FleshFriend> or yeah, dream training?
[4:54:30] <%megadblitz> hello hellow how long as the mans been streaming?
[4:54:31] <%SirGO0SE> he had a lamp not an artifact
[4:54:31] <AoiRob> this was them figuring out dream technology and one of the tests EXPLODED
[4:54:34] <%Frost_Quill> uhh...
[4:54:36] <%ape_hawk> hmm
[4:54:38] <cheapdoc> That was kindda fucked
[4:54:38] <%SirGO0SE> is that significant
[4:54:42] <%Frost_Quill> something was in the sky
[4:54:47] <DigiLapin> you can see the ringed planet?
[4:54:47] <hewwogames> planet shadow, kinda
[4:54:50] <%Frost_Quill> i think
[4:54:50] <jubejube56> wait does that mean you can travel with an artifact AND a lantern?
[4:54:52] <RyeBreadBakery> it was their planet wasn't it?
[4:54:56] <%Agami23> i think this is supposed to teach you how to get the fire
[4:54:57] <cheapdoc> that was like a monster or something
[4:54:57] <jubejube56> and they take you to different places?
[4:54:58] <%Valdorick> He saw their home world('s moon?)
[4:54:59] <tanarath> slide reel vs lantern?
[4:55:00] <yodajr99> dream world
[4:55:01] <ZilverZap> man this is some spooky shit
[4:55:03] <%megadblitz> oh i thought the game was shitting itself for a moment
[4:55:04] <cheapdoc> reel
[4:55:05] <%cobalt_phoenix_> oh wait in this one they used the artifact, in the other they used a lamp
[4:55:07] <chaosbringer28> its showing he travelled, it saying you need those fancy lamps and not a generic lantern to travel
[4:55:07] <KasiCrafter> These seemed to be DIRECT brain feeds, which means...spooky access?
[4:55:08] <%A_Zealous_Retort> reel on the wall
[4:55:08] <AzureSkyKnight> reel
[4:55:10] <vVAstrAVv> that one worked.
[4:55:11] <FleshFriend> oh
[4:55:12] <%A_Zealous_Retort> REEEEEEEL
[4:55:14] <teebos> reel
[4:55:22] <RyeBreadBakery> or there was a guy?
[4:55:28] <hewwogames> you should look for the v2 lantern and use it
[4:55:29] <ZilverZap> there's another reel PogChamp
[4:55:30] <nomos42> may want to close the breach
[4:55:35] <%walternatorz> upgrade to artifact?
[4:55:39] <%Valdorick> Oh, its how to use the lamps?
[4:55:41] <RyeBreadBakery> different lantern tests!!
[4:55:42] <TheRealNumberJ42> think this was them just doing experiments
[4:55:43] <+tomdwarf> Wait! Holy shit. I think an unlit lantern brings you to a different dreamscapes
[4:55:44] <ThatJFG> ThatJFG subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:55:56] <%Monkeyweed21> prototype testing
[4:55:58] <%JonathLP> they used a lamp
[4:55:59] <jorniev> THAT ONE HAS A DIFFERENT LAMP ARTIFACT
[4:55:59] <%A_Zealous_Retort> its the artifact development process
[4:56:03] <%DrTomT18> you might say this is some sort of room for running tests
[4:56:18] <hewwogames> this is how valve made artifact (the dota card game)
[4:56:22] <nomos42> so the whole place is venting now right?
[4:56:23] <%Frost_Quill> wait does having the artifact in a different state change something when you enter?
[4:56:27] <@DakotaMacDoodle> DakotaMacDoodle subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 16 month streak! Outer Wilds Rules!
[4:56:31] <cheapdoc> That's the room from where Gendo watches
[4:56:31] <%cobalt_phoenix_> WHAT
[4:56:33] <ZE_Count> you didnt explore this house
[4:56:34] <+emperri> hehe hard wood
[4:56:36] <%RetroCop87> isn't your ship made of wood?
[4:56:37] <DigiLapin> you walked right past it before lmao
[4:56:40] <%Valdorick> Oh, you're in the tower you couldn't reach.
[4:56:41] <Visorak6> projector nearby
[4:56:43] <+redyoshi5> you never checked this building
[4:56:44] <iosephe> yeah
[4:56:45] <%DrTomT18> yes Pat, you are that blind
[4:56:45] <Teras_ode> you've been to that window before
[4:56:45] <%Agami23> isnt your ship made out of wood??
[4:56:46] <TheRealNumberJ42> i thought he explored it all Kappa
[4:56:49] <%AyotoCorp> S H O R T C U T
[4:56:50] <vVAstrAVv> GOOOOORGE
[4:56:50] <Teras_ode> shortcut
[4:56:51] <+Like51bears> Shortcut
[4:56:52] <+tomdwarf> well, you can pop that reel in where you are.
[4:56:52] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HOW IS THIS WHOLE AREA NOT DEPRESURRIZED
[4:56:57] <AoiRob> hearthian ships are made out of wood so who tf knows really
[4:56:59] <chaosbringer28> well you gott a projector nearby at least
[4:57:03] <ZilverZap> man all these dark souls shortcuts are confusing
[4:57:04] <chaosbringer28> into the river
[4:57:08] <%jtdobyns> across the way
[4:57:12] <hewwogames> wood is famously vacuum sealed
[4:57:12] <ZE_Count> The trees keep the pressure
[4:57:12] <vVAstrAVv> suck it dork souls
[4:57:16] <%jtdobyns> through the ghost
[4:57:19] <%Frost_Quill> look at the slide
[4:57:36] <nomos42> @cobalt_phoenix_ sounds like it's in the process lol
[4:57:38] <tanarath> @cobalt_phoenix_ dunno, physics seem different near the eye
[4:57:39] <cheapdoc> @cobalt_phoenix_ The game maintained presence of oxygen with a few trees in like a moon, I think it's fine
[4:57:49] <+ReallyBigRocks> trees give off a field of oxygen rays
[4:57:59] <ZE_Count> temple behind ya
[4:58:03] <%A_Zealous_Retort> lantern across the bridge
[4:58:14] <hewwogames> there's literally breathable atmosphere on attlerock
[4:58:17] <%cobalt_phoenix_> fair enough, it just feels a little different bc it's like a whole station but true
[4:58:18] <%A_Zealous_Retort> where are you going pat
[4:58:25] <%Frost_Quill> you don't know that yet
[4:58:28] <RyeBreadBakery> light mechanics instead of quantum
[4:58:31] <%The_0_2_Hero> Well why would they, it's a totally different culture
[4:58:33] <vVAstrAVv> its a better shortcut than the reservoir
[4:58:35] <vVAstrAVv> imo
[4:58:36] <%Frost_Quill> i don't know i'm just as blind
[4:58:40] <%The_0_2_Hero> Or so it SEEMS
[4:58:41] <cheapdoc> Maybe they didn't want to complicate it too much, in case you discovered it early in the future
[4:58:41] <%bevyrage> to a degree they are using the observed quantum mechanics with the hidden rooms
[4:58:43] <ZilverZap> who needs quantum shit when you have SHADOW WORLD
[4:58:46] <+tomdwarf> the quantum stuff may be local to your system, or at least this race never interacted with quantum stuff
[4:58:51] <+KaguraRaion> Fuck the code!
[4:58:53] <%bevyrage> light = observed in a sense
[4:58:55] <HiveMasterMind> They hate the Eye form what it seems so no Quantum
[4:59:21] <vVAstrAVv> they dont seem to like the eye im sure they wouldn't mess with quantum
[4:59:25] <RyeBreadBakery> exploded
[4:59:31] <%DrTomT18> he ded
[4:59:34] <%Valdorick> Whatever happened there was fucked.
[4:59:36] <ZilverZap> he got kablooey
[4:59:38] <%kraken_lab> @bevyrage I think the hidden rooms might just be hidden doors rather then quantum state shit
[4:59:40] <RyuuAoi> Roast marshmallows
[4:59:48] <akitanito> pfft
[4:59:51] <$ringabal> ???
[4:59:52] <iosephe> LUL
[4:59:55] <reonome> LUL
[4:59:58] <ZE_Count> its kinda weird seeing these wood druid type people being scientist
[4:59:58] <chaosbringer28> there is one place that is still orange i believe
[5:00:00] <maybefalco> just one more loop LUL
[5:00:00] <nomos42> it was cool tho
[5:00:01] <%DrTomT18> didn't you though?
[5:00:01] <tanarath> the lanterns can be created, pat.
[5:00:01] <hewwogames> Pat Get The Explosion Lantern
[5:00:02] <%A_Zealous_Retort> you learned the explodey one can be used as a bomb if you find it
[5:00:02] <%cobalt_phoenix_> sure you did, you learned how to enter the dream world Kappa
[5:00:02] <%walternatorz> you learned another way to kill yourself
[5:00:03] <ZE_Count> got a shortcut
[5:00:03] <%Deadpal> LUL
[5:00:03] <%Frost_Quill> i wonder if you can find an "old" artifact
[5:00:04] <%The_0_2_Hero> You learned about a shortcut!
[5:00:05] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think I sorta get what went down
[5:00:05] <%Deadpal> you did though!
[5:00:05] <+emperri> kind of a waste of time
[5:00:05] <MartyFun11> Maybe you should try to find the secret room in the tower some more
[5:00:06] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[5:00:08] <akitanito> you learned that you learned nothing
[5:00:10] <KasiCrafter> You DID fins a shortcut!
[5:00:10] <HibikiYamada> well, you marked one location off, that's wroth it lol
[5:00:11] <ZilverZap> you learned what you already knew LUL
[5:00:15] <ZE_Count> LORE
[5:00:17] <%buerdo> try the same password from earlier
[5:00:19] <timothytops> you did learn that one will kill you
[5:00:20] <%asgard147> yes you did, thee log said so Pat limesOwo
[5:00:29] <tanarath> empty lantern + artefact = plasma lanter.
[5:00:29] <%walternatorz> and potentially another way to reset
[5:00:31] <%A_Zealous_Retort> find the mark 2 and suicide bomb the solar panels
[5:00:39] <leole11> i'll save you some trouble, it is not the same password from earlier
[5:01:01] <cheapdoc> pit
[5:01:09] <cheapdoc> big pit in the middle
[5:01:14] <%Agami23> i wonder what they did that was so bad that the second chamber just exploded
[5:01:22] <vVAstrAVv> you cant do the cove yet

[5:05:11] <%Profmcstevie> You only get one first impression, it's nice to not be spoiled
[5:05:15] <%Frost_Quill> i wasn't paying attention what got spoiled
[5:05:16] <%kraken_lab> @10deez it was a massive scam and the guy running it burned all the money
[5:05:17] <chaosbringer28> wait did he just get spoiled i walked away
[5:05:25] <%Monkeyweed21> what if it ends really bad?
