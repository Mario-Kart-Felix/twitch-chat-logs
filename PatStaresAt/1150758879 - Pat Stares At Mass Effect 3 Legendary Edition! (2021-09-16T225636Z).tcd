[0:22:02] <AngryAsian5> Big Gief needs BIG IRON
[0:22:04] <%topendbuzza> elmo
[0:22:05] <%DianaTheAscian> he*
[0:22:06] <cpt_langosta> he learns well from watching his parents
[0:22:09] <%Lefanque> If he eats enough rocks they'll just roll around in there and break eachother down problem solved
[0:22:09] <smoothwood07> he must begin his huge quest
[0:22:11] <cheapdoc> Rats need doors because they can't swim through your toilet
[0:22:14] <MarylandJutsu> oh god elmo can't be released
[0:22:14] <%lumporr> cheer500 got a job as the front of house for a 2000 seating theatre during the UK's covid reopening. what a fucking nightmare. have some bitz
[0:22:15] <+Mrbaconator> reverse vampire he can't leave
[0:22:17] <%cade_calrayn> Considering all the chaos Gief causes when he's out of Pat's sight
[0:22:17] <%InternetShis> Listen Pat it's a gastrolith, he needs to digest the poop
[0:22:21] <austinj24> Elmo would take over the country
[0:22:23] <secret_npc> just like his mama
[0:22:25] <%barrakuta371> to be fair, my dogs regularly bring back apples and birds, so you have a point with Gief
[0:22:25] <%MooseIsGoose> you have to give him some independence

[0:22:30] <@ssjklyco> Rock solid dumbs
[0:22:30] <%topendbuzza> oh so a pebble not a rock
[0:22:31] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It's why i live here, my dog goes outside without me worrying about her doom
[0:22:32] <%maskofmichael> Zangeif would talk to a stranger and eat their chocolate
[0:22:34] <%cade_calrayn> And considering all the chaos he causes while Pat *can* see him
[0:22:37] <$sleepystardewfarmer> my dog ate a whole ream of staples when he was a puppy... he needed emergency surgery
[0:22:41] <%DrTomT18> When I was a kid, my great grand parents had a dog that could open doors to let himself and the other dogs outside to pee. You should do that with Gief, I see no way this could go wrong.

[0:43:41] <%DianaTheAscian> its like meeting people who like gundam zz
[0:43:42] <%DrTomT18> The cable hooked up to the fan kept brushing up against the hardrive and making the fan spin way to fast. My computer repair friend said it was the weirdest thing he had ever seen

[0:43:57] <Sunstalker> @PeachSaliva He really had some bugs in his system. Kappa
[0:43:57] <Gorshum> It's like Dark Souls 2 being someone's favorite Soulsborne.

[1:01:04] <studleydoorite> I come here for l33t gameplay jermaEgg
[1:01:05] <%Dopamien> as long as I still get to make fun of you when  you die
[1:01:06] <+burnie_mcburntface> Just have fun so we can have fun
[1:01:06] <QuestlordJake> shepard like gun
[1:01:07] <Treasure_Vault> There are games where difficulty matters, and games where it doesn't
[1:01:07] <BoneSkore> do it pat
[1:01:07] <+MatthewClarke> do it your way @PatStaresAt
[1:01:08] <%LumberjackJack> LUL Legion's got caps
[1:01:08] <supergoblinpunch> normals good
[1:01:09] <%Kemmybelle> Play in whatever difficulty is most comfortable for you.
[1:01:10] <%saadi90> Most of us don’t come here for the games
[1:01:12] <%maenos2> very freudian
[1:01:13] <%bassoontyphoon> @PatStaresAt the most engaging thing is when you're enjoying the game tbh, so whatever makes that possible is best imo
[1:01:15] <%dekkitout> BEND THE SPOON, SHEPARD-COMMANDER
[1:01:16] <+condemned_15> just don't turn into Spoony or FarFromSubtle
[1:01:16] <%kingmemelord97> so is this  a example of the ends justify the means ?
[1:01:17] <James_Quivers> Legion why you no give me nipple lazer instead
[1:01:18] <Laecerelius> It's all you can say!  It's all you can say!
[1:01:19] <TioXyco> guns and baning
[1:01:19] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[1:01:20] <CosmicApe13> Shepard with every gun in his mind 24/7
[1:01:20] <%lumporr> easy mode is fine but in games that are supposed to be tense then it can be kinda eh
[1:01:20] <raikagelord1> I don’t care. Throughout most my childhood and teen years I played in easy mode.
[1:01:21] <@ssjklyco> They should have turned this section to a character action game
[1:01:22] <TioXyco> *banging
[1:01:22] <%Ipsenscastle> wow, chat's fast today
[1:01:23] <DatAsuna> No, play whatever you want.
[1:01:23] <$sleepystardewfarmer> you do whatever you want
[1:01:23] <@TheYellowcouch> gaby
[1:01:24] <@Ranryu692> it's all They want him to know
[1:01:26] <+cermo55> you should have had a delete charge attack
[1:01:26] <%DrTomT18> Shepard has 3 hobbies, guns, qussy, and model ships... oh, and fish I guess?
[1:01:26] <%AmuserName> IMO the only time when easy mode "matters" is when it removes mechanics, like how ME forces you to remove shields/armor on higher difficulties to use the physics effects of biotics. @PatStaresAt
[1:01:27] <DXLelouch24> Yes im here to watch you fail not succeed otherwise if watch w movie
[1:01:28] <%JoshManVGH> FUCK no, we watch the stream for shit talk and yo see cool videogame shit, who cares about difficulty in someone ELSE playing a videogame?
[1:01:28] <peachy996> I don't want you to have fun, I want you to learn from the hardest hard mode. Now eat your razorblades
[1:01:28] <%tamale_senpai> What ever works for you @PatStaresAt I never played ME3 on hardcore back in the day, you a manly man for doing so
[1:01:28] <secret_npc> Legion equips Shepard with a weaponized Tali
[1:01:29] <digaogrunge> I LOVE GUN
[1:01:29] <%CasualSleepyGamer> Norton Antivirus is a Gun
[1:01:30] <cpt_langosta> new game + gunbaby
[1:01:31] <SkreamnRedSkull> LOL Gunbaby
[1:01:33] <%aBlueWizard> Actually i changed my mind, i want you only to play in easy so if you fail it's even funnier
[1:01:33] <James_Quivers> OUTSKILLED
[1:01:35] <%stantheman_97> it okay since the older you get the slower you are
[1:01:36] <@goose_attack_almanac> But the world is square!
[1:01:38] <%Aeoneth> @PatStaresAt   Pat I say this in the  most respectful manner,  but I don't come here for High Skill Gameplay
[1:01:39] <%AmericanSkidd> do you need a map?
[1:01:40] <%Dakuu75> @dekkitout lmfao "There is no spoon shepard" XD
[1:01:42] <sodamin1> i don't even come for the games at this point your personality is all that matters to me
[1:01:45] <@Spydurman> even Narrative mode can't fix that
[1:01:46] <AngryAsian5> This level is just one big hacking minigame
[1:01:48] <BoneSkore> it's much better fdor you to have fun and make progress instead of getting stuck because you wanted to show off on hardmode
[1:01:50] <ExpressNode> Piss off your dad by being a casual
[1:01:59] <%SWFanatic> Is that you Shodan?
[1:02:00] <%CasualSleepyGamer> All these Squares make a Circle
[1:02:06] <%LumberjackJack> Odd about the helmet disappearing real quick
[1:02:09] <Rao2357> piss all over dad's face
[1:02:14] <Treasure_Vault> People watch Dark Souls streams to watch you die. People don't watch Mass Effect streams to watch you die.
[1:02:15] <%DrTomT18> I like that they mix things up a little bit
[1:02:16] <%sporeian94> Pat there's a collectable on the left!
[1:02:16] <%stantheman_97> it's very weird
[1:02:19] <%Ipsenscastle> nobody expects cube
[1:02:21] <peachy996> I DO want you to fight Kai Leng on babyeasybitch mode. It'll be way funnier
[1:02:23] <@TheYellowcouch> kill cube
[1:02:27] <%LumberjackJack> @CasualSleepyGamer Did you do a whole gallon of LSD?
[1:02:32] <%DrTomT18> There is a collectable in here Pat
[1:02:34] <santafer> This is how QA and devs see debugging
[1:02:35] <%sporeian94> Pat go back missed a collectable for EMS
[1:02:35] <%DrTomT18> I think
[1:02:37] <+cermo55> get ready for the cluster surprise
[1:02:37] <Drunkengen> kill cancer
[1:02:38] <%machshop> snip snip i want to cut it off
[1:02:38] <secret_npc> So satifying
[1:02:47] <intestinal_bleeding> god if only cybersec was this easy
[1:02:49] <%jillyrancher> Oh God killing Kai Leng in seconds yes play on Easy for that
[1:02:51] <%lumporr> you're defragmenting the harddrive
[1:02:52] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt Somewhere in here, you can examine a piece of reaper code
[1:02:52] <@QueequegTheater> NotLikeThis
[1:02:53] <James_Quivers> Shoot the balls
[1:02:58] <Aoworth> rm -rf /geth/
[1:02:59] <%CasualSleepyGamer> Tell me I can leave the lookout
[1:03:01] <%tinytinykittycat> power wash the data
[1:03:05] <Dunmarkh> no
[1:03:06] <%sporeian94> Pat collectable to the left
[1:03:09] <DatAsuna> totally the hardest level in the game xD
[1:03:10] <%Dakuu75> can you actually fall off? or it makes platforms all the time?
[1:03:11] <%sporeian94> Nehind you
[1:03:14] <%DrTomT18> turn around, I think
[1:03:16] <James_Quivers> LORE
[1:03:17] <%AmuserName> CLEAN THE ORB, just like your daily showers.
[1:03:17] <intestinal_bleeding> shoulda infected the reapers with ransomware
[1:03:19] <DXLelouch24> I find easy mode not as entertaining so hell no id probably tune out
[1:03:22] <DSD24> Ooo lore
[1:03:26] <%sporeian94> collectable is right behind ya
[1:03:28] <+cermo55> lets gooooooooooooo
[1:03:36] <DatAsuna> It's kind ridiculous that this mission is optional
[1:03:39] <%AlteisenReiseZ> AlteisenReiseZ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 18 month streak! 19 Months! One more and I'm getting a free soda! Been on a recent streak with games RN, finishing NeoTWEWY and NMH3, and now starting Arise, and waiting for Lumina. Keep up the good work! Pet the mustard goblin for me!
[1:03:42] <intestinal_bleeding> what is that, xorn!?
[1:03:43] <James_Quivers> ORIGINAL GETH
[1:03:48] <%DrTomT18> I THINK THAT IS LEGION ON THE TABLE
[1:04:01] <lloyddboy> GETH MEANS SLAVE
[1:04:01] <Profmcstevie> They named them servant?! Fucking hell
[1:04:02] <%lumporr> "GETH" IS A SLAVE NAME
[1:04:03] <%JohnAtDawn> ROBOT MEANS SLAVE BTW
[1:04:05] <DSD24> Where's Zero 2 then
[1:04:08] <%GabeSweetMan> ONE
[1:04:09] <%Ipsenscastle> 'we didn't want to make new models for Quarians'
[1:04:10] <+condemned_15> 1st Geth ran on Linux
[1:04:11] <%DrTomT18> collectable behind you pat!
[1:04:11] <Aoworth> Legion is taking you to meet his parents
[1:04:12] <%LumberjackJack> Just 1
[1:04:13] <@goose_attack_almanac> BULLSHIT
[1:04:14] <digaogrunge> LEGION IS GETH JESUS
[1:04:14] <%GabeSweetMan> Yeyeye
[1:04:15] <$hattrick61> Daisy, Daisy...
[1:04:16] <peachy996> Basically shut up
[1:04:17] <olm46> You don't get to see them bare
[1:04:17] <dd44dostivei> lol
[1:04:18] <Dunmarkh> LUL
[1:04:20] <kingra> QUSSY
[1:04:22] <AngryAsian5> LUL
[1:04:24] <%Dakuu75> ONE BABY~!
[1:04:24] <santafer> Or bioware didnt want to model quarians
[1:04:25] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[1:04:26] <Sp3ctre48> Because we don't want to model their faces Shepard
[1:04:26] <peachy996> Shut up we don't want to make it
[1:04:27] <@ssjklyco> Unmasked and unpants
[1:04:27] <+miguelrod777> shut up that's why
[1:04:28] <%sporeian94> pat collectable behind you!
[1:04:29] <%DrTomT18> aaand he missed it
[1:04:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> So its just a way to sidestep it
[1:04:38] <James_Quivers> Imagine the archives being filled with naked Talis lmao
[1:04:39] <+cermo55> you need a larger sample size
[1:04:42] <%JoshManVGH> But what if she kept the mask on?
[1:04:45] <%topendbuzza> yep
[1:04:46] <%sporeian94> pat go back!
[1:04:48] <%walternatorz> I love how half this sequence is explaining how lazy bioware is
[1:04:48] <%jillyrancher> I think you can buy that one
[1:04:49] <%maenos2> psaBlind
[1:04:52] <Aoworth> Asset reuse is VALID
[1:04:53] <%stantheman_97> "we don't have a unmasked model"
[1:04:56] <DatAsuna> 1
[1:04:57] <%Ipsenscastle> @James_Quivers LUL I was just thinking that
[1:05:01] <notsoy> asset reuse is fine - look at yakuza
[1:05:03] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Pat how ready are you for even MORE Quarian war crimes?
[1:05:04] <Ekaelis> I bet there's pictures or vids of unmasked quarians on extranet
[1:05:05] <+condemned_15> blind
[1:05:05] <%sporeian94> psaBlind
[1:05:08] <santafer> slow organic processor
[1:05:10] <%AmuserName> ORANGE CODE BAD
[1:05:11] <%DrTomT18> why do Quarians hide their faces, why do they have to wear opaque masks
[1:05:11] <28moogles> Wouldn't that be re6?
[1:05:15] <notsoy> tbh i can't think of a series that does asset reuse better than yakuza
[1:05:16] <%sporeian94> go back pat
[1:05:16] <cpt_langosta> dammit pat, i had safely forgotten about that...
[1:05:16] <DatAsuna> gotta reuse those assets
[1:05:20] <%aBlueWizard> WESKER BABIES, WE MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE
[1:05:22] <+CyanDeadEye> Channel your inner Chris and punch the corruption!
[1:05:24] <%maskofmichael> code on ball
[1:05:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> a little
[1:05:25] <%Rookie_Balboa> back at the start of this orb
[1:05:25] <James_Quivers> Missed one back there
[1:05:25] <+condemned_15> missed collectible
[1:05:26] <%twistedj3ster> this reminds me of the worst part of Far Harbor
[1:05:28] <Aoworth> Is that like Muppet Babies?
[1:05:28] <%jillyrancher> Eva Babies
[1:05:29] <%SpcOpsBear> semi-blind, you're only shooting the vines and not the roots from the cluster
[1:05:32] <%tinytinykittycat> keep shootin the orb
[1:05:32] <@ssjklyco> Wesker babiesss, they'll make your virus for youuuu
[1:05:36] <%lumporr> keep shoot big cluster
[1:05:37] <spuginky> compwete gwobal satuwation
[1:05:39] <DatAsuna> @DrTomT18 so they don't have to make faces
[1:05:41] <peachy996> Asset Reuse is more funny when you pair that with a woman from Google Images touched up with Photoshop
[1:05:41] <CosmicApe13> I thought it was dumb that Wesker just randomly had a full grown kid
[1:05:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Does this mean that the Redfield bloodline has failled to continue to bhe wesker bloodline isgoing strong
[1:05:51] <%Conscript_Gary> Lore time!
[1:05:52] <@goose_attack_almanac> @ssjklyco the virus is child support
[1:05:57] <%AmericanSkidd> Sadness
[1:06:01] <%Dakuu75> awwww....
[1:06:03] <%KetsuoTaberu> FeelsBadMan
[1:06:07] <Aoworth> BibleThump
[1:06:08] <+cermo55> they just want to help
[1:06:10] <%DrTomT18> :(
[1:06:12] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "If we aren't wrong, why do you shoot us?
[1:06:15] <%Ipsenscastle> were Quarians fighting the Geth during Earth Victorian times?
[1:06:16] <@QueequegTheater> Sadge
[1:06:17] <DSD24> What a hero
[1:06:18] <%GabeSweetMan> They just wanted to help. BibleThump
[1:06:20] <Chaos_Aether> are you serious
[1:06:20] <ThatGuyThere03> Wait
[1:06:20] <%lumporr> "don't kill me"
[1:06:27] <%cooldude69xx> This is really piling it on
[1:06:29] <LightningLynx89> All it had to do was turn off like a good toaster
[1:06:29] <%Archphronimos> fuck the Quarians are just.... so evil
[1:06:31] <%jillyrancher> Innocent babies
[1:06:33] <%chill_o_wisp> they knew they were making real AI
[1:06:40] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fuck organics
[1:06:41] <%cooldude69xx> They'd be right tho
[1:06:41] <%Dopamien> MrDestructoid wtf
[1:06:42] <James_Quivers> Correct, fuck robots
[1:06:46] <%sporeian94> Pat go back come on...
[1:06:47] <%lumporr> not even a conversation
[1:06:48] <%dekkitout> 💯
[1:06:49] <+cermo55> always team robo
[1:06:49] <%DrTomT18> I will side with robots like 90% of the time
[1:06:50] <Treasure_Vault> robots are imminently fuckable
[1:06:50] <%Dopamien> MrDestructoid yea we are
[1:06:50] <28moogles> They just liked Battlestar Galactica.
[1:06:51] <%topendbuzza> robots ARE COOL
[1:06:55] <Aoworth> Also Organics are fucking assholes
[1:06:55] <%Ipsenscastle> more like SNOREganics
[1:06:55] <%RigmaroleHM> Robots own
[1:06:56] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> geth are adorable
[1:06:56] <santafer> pew pew
[1:06:56] <DSD24> Aww yeah the genocide
[1:06:56] <intestinal_bleeding> when will they understand? ROBOTS. ARE. EROTIC.
[1:06:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> PEOPLE GIVE THEIR PERSONALITY TO THEIR TOASTERS
[1:06:59] <LightningLynx89> @PatStaresAt Most people side with the Geth in every Mass Effect discussion I've had online
[1:06:59] <%RayCSmooth> Hoomans suck
[1:07:00] <GustauveVIII> robots never displayed being evil, just wanting
[1:07:00] <lbrownthedestroyer> Meatbags
[1:07:01] <@goose_attack_almanac> Robots are cool. But Quarians are hot
[1:07:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I'm organic and i fuckin' hate most organics who aren't my dog
[1:07:02] <%DrTomT18> I THINK THATS LEGION
[1:07:03] <Drunkengen> AH THE CLASSIC GENOCIDE
[1:07:04] <%Wallabri> didn't understand that robots are the best, actually?
[1:07:05] <%Rookie_Balboa> BIG MOMENT
[1:07:06] <%JamesCorck> Most of the GetH vs Quarian choices in this game are pretty clear cut.
[1:07:08] <%tamale_senpai> I wish I was a robot
[1:07:12] <ThatGuyThere03> why are the Quarians wearing environment suits before they ever lost their home planet?
[1:07:13] <%ahomeschooldropout> this part makes no sense
[1:07:16] <Sp3ctre48> I think there were different writers at some point cause it's not written nearly as grey of an issue as it used to be
[1:07:17] <%DrTomT18> THATS LEGION I'M TELL YOU
[1:07:19] <AngryAsian5> Look how they massacred our boys BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:07:20] <DXLelouch24> Have you seen how shitty humans can be?!
[1:07:25] <%Rookie_Balboa> THE ORIGINAL GETH
[1:07:26] <Sunstalker> NAH, geth is the time I agree with Woolie about beign a race traitor. mtpCLAP
[1:07:26] <%Ipsenscastle> DUMB
[1:07:27] <%Rookie_Balboa> WAS HIM
[1:07:28] <santafer> efficient at killing quarians
[1:07:29] <%cooldude69xx> "I can't believe that geth committed suicide down the stairs"
[1:07:29] <cpt_langosta> legion old af
[1:07:30] <%sporeian94> yes
[1:07:31] <olm46> yes
[1:07:32] <lloyddboy> ROBOT FARMER REVOLT
[1:07:32] <jorniev> LEGION WAS A FARMER!?
[1:07:34] <%DrTomT18> I think so
[1:07:34] <%Dakuu75> I guess
[1:07:34] <+CyanDeadEye> Yes
[1:07:34] <%robotoken> no
[1:07:35] <+FoolsArcade> yes
[1:07:36] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> YUP
[1:07:36] <%JamesCorck> Not implying.
[1:07:37] <%slimmixrp> Legion is Moses
[1:07:37] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat I really like they make the Quarians so unlikable.its it's more interesting than just "robots are bad"
[1:07:37] <%cade_calrayn> Yuuuuuuuup
[1:07:37] <LightningLynx89> Yes
[1:07:39] <Dunmarkh> Technically?
[1:07:40] <%dooscent> you're in Legion's consensus
[1:07:40] <%topendbuzza> ye
[1:07:40] <CosmicApe13> yep
[1:07:40] <+miguelrod777> Kappa
[1:07:40] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Yes and no
[1:07:41] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> There is no Legion
[1:07:41] <%AmuserName> Pretty much.
[1:07:42] <%JamesCorck> These are Legion's memories.
[1:07:42] <%PunchSlugfest> Legion is Geth
[1:07:43] <%Wallabri> i think so
[1:07:43] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Legion is Geth so yes they are his memories
[1:07:43] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[1:07:43] <scrumbotime> I mean, they're digital beings, of course they can live forever
[1:07:44] <%GuilKato> all geth share memory
[1:07:45] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> yea
[1:07:45] <secret_npc> Maybe idk
[1:07:46] <Treasure_Vault> Probably?
[1:07:46] <%Ipsenscastle> it's super dumb
[1:07:46] <+zanz_san> Western culture has a bias against  robots
[1:07:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LEGION IS ROBOT JESUS
[1:07:46] <%jillyrancher> unlikable
[1:07:47] <willyfreshness> Legions fuckin cool
[1:07:47] <Ekaelis> Legion is thousand of different programs
[1:07:47] <%PunchSlugfest> Geth is Legion
[1:07:48] <%the_Punktuation> Not all of them
[1:07:48] <santafer> IA IA OH
[1:07:48] <Drunkengen> They are Legion
[1:07:48] <@QueequegTheater> Yes
[1:07:48] <%AmericanSkidd> He is over 1000 programs
[1:07:48] <%Conscript_Gary> Old McLegion had a farm, E I E I O
[1:07:49] <Profmcstevie> Legion is a collection platform, he is not any 1
[1:07:50] <%tinytinykittycat> collective geth memories
[1:07:50] <%RigmaroleHM> @ThatGuyThere03 In-game answer: they're based on Shephards memories. Real answer: model reuse
[1:07:50] <Chaos_Aether> Geth memories
[1:07:50] <+OneGorillionDollars> Legion was a simple farmer BibleThump
[1:07:50] <%tamale_senpai> he is many
[1:07:50] <%sporeian94> legion is a bunch of platforms in one geth, it's likely some of them were there from the beginning
[1:07:50] <@ssjklyco> Legion is all geth so he could be all memories
[1:07:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt maybe some of legion's memories
[1:07:52] <mesamus> remember legion is multiple geth
[1:07:53] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Organics anthropomorphize rocks, what are you even trying to say?
[1:07:53] <santafer> Old McLegion
[1:07:53] <jorniev> I MEAN ITS ALL GETH
[1:07:53] <%maskofmichael> Maybe?
[1:07:54] <sodamin1> yes
[1:07:54] <TioXyco> not exactlyl. but that Legion was the first one to arms, yes
[1:07:54] <%JamesCorck> Dude the Geth in the recordings sounds like Legion.
[1:07:54] <28moogles> Geth is Geth
[1:07:54] <%sporeian94> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[1:07:54] <%lumporr> what fuckin' assholes
[1:07:55] <DSD24> @ThatGuyThere03 Legion explained it that Shepard only knows Quarians with their suits on so that's how they look to Shepard
[1:07:55] <Jmann1892> Legion is Geth
[1:07:55] <DatAsuna> It's more 50/50 than you'd think because a lot of people just go "oh quarians are space israel" and then go all in on quarians
[1:07:55] <GustauveVIII> are all of legion comprised of the same programs back then?
[1:07:56] <James_Quivers> The way Geth consciousness works, Legion probably was one of the programs from back then
[1:07:56] <%GabeSweetMan> Well if it's a SHARED CONCIOUSNESS, then yess and now.
[1:07:57] <viewtifulr> Legion just wants to plant but cant :(
[1:07:57] <%VitoXXI> this kinda looks like a warframe test room
[1:07:58] <$KnightAsteran> kinda
[1:07:58] <+kettleroot> Geth share their memmories
[1:07:58] <%AmericanSkidd> ...
[1:07:59] <%walternatorz> I never picked up on that, but it certainly looked heavily implied
[1:07:59] <jorniev> YES
[1:08:00] <AngryAsian5> You're space Jesus, he's robo Moses.
[1:08:00] <%JamesCorck> Keep playing, Pat.
[1:08:01] <+FoolsArcade> Legion is platform Jesus
[1:08:03] <%tinytinykittycat> they seem to share a memory pool
[1:08:03] <Aoworth> I mean they'd probably handwave it away as geth having a different sense of self
[1:08:04] <digaogrunge> Legion is many
[1:08:04] <+deadredeyez> mby
[1:08:05] <%jillyrancher> Geth share memories
[1:08:06] <%walternatorz> how about robot moses?
[1:08:07] <DSD24> Aww yeah I love Admiral Raan
[1:08:09] <%LumberjackJack> Yes and no. Maybe one of his pieces of programming was a part of that model. Geth are complicated
[1:08:12] <@QueequegTheater> No he's Robot Moses
[1:08:12] <%Puhff> I doubt that model was personally there
[1:08:14] <%cooldude69xx> @jillyrancher Is it tho? Its still just "X" is bad
[1:08:15] <scrumbotime> clonk
[1:08:15] <Dunmarkh> LUL

[1:08:20] <jorniev> its working
[1:08:20] <peachy996> ha suck it robutt
[1:08:21] <cpt_langosta> GETH DO A KEYBOARD SMASH ON CONTROLS
[1:08:21] <James_Quivers> Geth is drunk
[1:08:21] <ShinyVagikarp> Robo Moses KEKW
[1:08:21] <DatAsuna> geth's memories
[1:08:23] <chancho4tierra> They all are GETH its a compilation of memories
[1:08:26] <dd44dostivei> SHEPARD, FIRE ON THE QUARIANS
[1:08:30] <GustauveVIII> arent all geth legion?
[1:08:30] <%DrTomT18> whats weirder is that Legion doesn't tell you that they are his memories because he's embaressed
[1:08:30] <%MidnightBurst12> sleepy geth
[1:08:35] <%sporeian94> my head canon is the hole he got is from the morning war
[1:08:35] <%rekinom> I have made a PastaRat, it's on twitter
[1:08:39] <%CasualSleepyGamer> Legion is Neo
[1:08:41] <+Grave_Titan_D> aren't they networked? they would all have the same memories
[1:08:42] <conchthechimera> Oh God that is Chrisjen's actress isn't it
[1:08:44] <%Conscript_Gary> oh no the ominous dialogue hyphen
[1:08:46] <$hattrick61> @ThatGuyThere03 they mentioned that these are memories being filtered through shepards perception, and since he's only seen one quarian without a suit, he sees them with suits
[1:08:46] <%DrTomT18> you missed it
[1:08:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @cpt_langosta dhdnhwhgrvjehcufiejxhwkjxe
[1:08:48] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Kill the not geth, shephard

[1:09:23] <@Ranryu692> @Dakuu75 they don't have the capacity for intelligence while disconnected

[1:10:54] <SaltyAzteca> @ChrisPlaysThing OH NO NotLikeThis
[1:10:56] <%SpcOpsBear> don't we call that a "third"
[1:11:02] <+cermo55> Quarians, they will kill their own to kill more Geth. Always more Geth.
[1:11:09] <%AmericanSkidd> the plot thickens
[1:11:12] <%lumporr> does this count as gameplay
[1:11:17] <stranger59> My dad won't let me play Roblox, please help.
[1:11:18] <%maenos2> A pose
[1:11:19] <%GabeSweetMan> So all the nice Quarians got purged too.

[1:11:42] <Goraka91> Geth: We remember the good ones
[1:11:43] <%cooldude69xx> This is so overdoing it
[1:11:44] <%Fooguwu> WAIT THEY EVEN FUCKED UP GETH SYMPATHIZERS?
[1:11:44] <Treasure_Vault> We remember the good ones!
[1:11:45] <Laecerelius> Gotta love how the Quarians on their home planet are wearing the suits
[1:11:46] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Geth simps go to the gulag
[1:11:48] <Sp3ctre48> yeeeaah
[1:11:48] <%CapnBeefs> A geth remembers
[1:11:49] <%dekkitout> Muh Iron Giant
[1:11:50] <DatAsuna> Killied for not being racist
[1:11:50] <%JamesCorck> The Quarians suck.
[1:11:50] <@commanderclaw> The quarians are so in the wrong it's comical
[1:11:51] <%tinytinykittycat> AQAB
[1:11:52] <SaltyAzteca> Theyre the worst AND the best
[1:11:53] <%topendbuzza> ye
[1:11:53] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> they really are lol
[1:11:53] <@Ranryu692> yup
[1:11:54] <+cermo55> because they killed the best
[1:11:55] <peachy996> We should kill them all
[1:11:55] <willyfreshness> but so fuckable
[1:11:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> but slappable asses
[1:11:55] <%maskofmichael> Are The Geth black?
[1:11:56] <%maenos2> worse than batarians?
[1:11:57] <Ekaelis> Not all Quarians
[1:11:57] <%sporeian94> The best part of this mission is it completely invalidates the theme of the ending
[1:11:58] <Treasure_Vault> @Goraka91 Jinx, you owe me civil rights
[1:11:58] <peachy996> Tali too
[1:12:00] <DSD24> But Admiral Xen is so hot though
[1:12:02] <%bassoontyphoon> except the ones we just saw
[1:12:02] <%DrTomT18> @Ches_Neckbeard I think you mean civil rights activist
[1:12:03] <%GuilKato> upload those good quarian who liked the Gethssy records to the quarian fleet
[1:12:03] <secret_npc> Nah, they were doing what they had to
[1:12:03] <Profmcstevie> End those who disagree, and you have an army of people on board with war
[1:12:07] <TioXyco> not as bad as batarians
[1:12:07] <%JamesCorck> The Quarians in this game are portrayed as absolute assholes.
[1:12:08] <peachy996> Have her take a Swim
[1:12:08] <%senfood> ARE WE STILL ON HOW ABSOLUTELY SHITTY THIS WAR WAS?
[1:12:11] <%LumberjackJack> Continues that ongoing theme in ME of authoritarian gov'ts sucking ass
[1:12:11] <luftraumm1> but you enjoy the qussy
[1:12:15] <Dunmarkh> Quarians earned their deaths
[1:12:15] <SocialMisfitGamer> All my homies hate the Quarians
[1:12:16] <tanarath> Worse than the Salarians or the Batarians?
[1:12:19] <%Rumbutt> best thing the quarians ever did was make the cool robots they tried to genocide
[1:12:20] <PaperyHornet1013> Kill talk pat she’s basically a batarian
[1:12:22] <%topendbuzza> lol
[1:12:22] <Blackleafx> YEA
[1:12:24] <%LumberjackJack> YEP, FUCK THE ENDING
[1:12:24] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @Ches_Neckbeard yes but jokes
[1:12:26] <Latija> but ai is evil
[1:12:26] <rambling_madman> I'm from Buenos Aires and I say kill em all
[1:12:30] <SaltyAzteca> MASS EFFECT BATTLE NETWORK THOUGH
[1:12:36] <secret_npc> It doesn't invalidate it if you destroy the Geth
[1:12:36] <DatAsuna> Lowkey I could save both sides but quarians don't deserve it
[1:12:37] <%lumporr> by some miraacle they created life, and they stop at nothing trying to kill it
[1:12:38] <smokios> i completely forget this was a thing
[1:12:44] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @DrTomT18 yes but Pat style jokes friend
[1:12:44] <santafer> They DID kil 99.5% of the quarians...
[1:12:44] <peachy996> Mass Effect 3: All The Aliens are Asshole and Humanity is the Best
[1:12:45] <+ProfessorMorrigan> people?
[1:12:46] <%AmericanSkidd> almost like it was written by different people...
[1:12:47] <jorniev> this makes the reapers basically huge assholes
[1:12:48] <DSD24> Legion is talking over himself!
[1:12:48] <raikagelord1> @rambling_madman LUL
[1:12:48] <%maenos2> You mean Casey hudson
[1:12:49] <%afronooch> yeaaah
[1:12:54] <Profmcstevie> the people writing the ending LOCKED THEMSELVES IN A ROOM, remember
[1:12:54] <%GabeSweetMan> It's almost like the Ending..... was re-written or something.
[1:12:55] <+ProfessorMorrigan> ending was one guy
[1:12:57] <Goraka91> AI bad
[1:12:58] <%maenos2> also fuck hudson
[1:13:01] <santafer> well amogn those that sided agaisnt them
[1:13:01] <%LumberjackJack> Just a small miscommunication LUL Bless you
[1:13:02] <Jmann1892> Bless You
[1:13:02] <Treasure_Vault> We decided not to communicate!
[1:13:03] <%afronooch> bless u
[1:13:04] <%sporeian94> Casey and Mac
[1:13:06] <stranger59> Bless ya
[1:13:06] <Sp3ctre48> well that's what happens when you turn the theme of a subplot into the main theme of the series in the last 20 minutes of the finale
[1:13:08] <+D00msDayDan> big man sneeze
[1:13:11] <%Puhff> Didn't Casey Hudson and another guy bang out the ending in a weekend?
[1:13:12] <%JoshManVGH> Seems like some kind of Magic...
[1:13:12] <ohno778> they changed the ending
[1:13:12] <cpt_langosta> bold of you to assume hudson has balls
[1:13:16] <BurdRightsActivist> LOCK YOURSELF IN A ROOM KEKW
[1:13:19] <%JoshManVGH> Bioware Magic
[1:13:19] <%Dakuu75> we wee the mass effect, all along~
[1:13:19] <%Ipsenscastle> this is what you get when two guys lock themselves in a room away from everyone to brute force the shitty ending they want into the project
[1:13:20] <%cooldude69xx> Javik is awful quiet about this shit
[1:13:20] <DXLelouch24> Yea but Starchild is FUCKING Lying so its fine Geth fine,all fine.
[1:13:21] <intestinal_bleeding> I. AM. THE MASS EFFECT.
[1:13:21] <%maenos2> @puhff yes
[1:13:24] <%JamesCorck> The real villain of Mass Effect was Casey Hudson all along.
[1:13:26] <secret_npc> DIRECT INTERVENTION IS UNECESSARY
[1:13:27] <digaogrunge> Why these old memory Quarians wear  spacesuits?
[1:13:29] <santafer> It woulve been cool is the pro geth quarians still lived in Rannoch
[1:13:31] <%Puhff> like it was a fucking Michaek Bay movie
[1:13:33] <PaperyHornet1013> Pat please betray tali be a robo bro
[1:13:33] <%NateyBeak> "haha lets not make the whole plot about the title of the game"
[1:13:35] <%jillyrancher> Where are people getting this information from btw
[1:13:35] <%DianaTheAscian> what does Casey even do nowadays?
[1:13:37] <Goatllama> "Now that it's all over I see it was just one big... mass effect."
[1:13:39] <@goose_attack_almanac> Casey Hudson was Kai leng the whole time
[1:13:46] <Treasure_Vault> The real mass effect was the friends we made along the way.
[1:13:51] <%GabeSweetMan> It's almost like the creative process is collaborative.
[1:13:51] <%Conscript_Gary> Javic is too busy seething that he didn't get to shoot the reaper code
[1:14:02] <%Mutsu2k> Fucking starchild should have been something harbinger made up to trick Shepard
[1:14:04] <Goraka91> BECOME HUMAN
[1:14:05] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @goose_attack_almanac what if he wrote Kai Leng?
[1:14:12] <%dekkitout> Fly away Iron Giant, fly
[1:14:14] <%GabeSweetMan> YIKES
[1:14:19] <%Fooguwu> WOW
[1:14:19] <DSD24> Not Meg!
[1:14:20] <peachy996> Ooh!
[1:14:21] <santafer> Dad?
[1:14:22] <AngryAsian5> BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[1:14:22] <%LumberjackJack> BibleThump
[1:14:24] <intestinal_bleeding> BRUH
[1:14:26] <SaltyAzteca> FLY YOU FOOL BibleThump
[1:14:27] <%AmericanSkidd> Sadness
[1:14:27] <%Dakuu75> BibleThump
[1:14:28] <DSD24> Why they had to kill Meg
[1:14:30] <%GabeSweetMan> WOOOOOOW
[1:14:33] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> awww...
[1:14:34] <%Fooguwu> FUCK'S SAKE QUARIANS
[1:14:35] <secret_npc> Like if the Quarians didn't try to destroy the Geth, what would the Council do to them?
[1:14:35] <%maskofmichael> Oh no! Sad
[1:14:37] <%DrTomT18> Anger is BIG
[1:14:38] <James_Quivers> This and the ending don't necessarily clash, the Reapers logic is on a massive timescale while the whole Geth conflict is within like 300 years. The theory that conflict is inevitable given enough time can still stand.
[1:14:41] <tanarath> 'Outnumbered'
[1:14:41] <notsoy> totally not holocaust shit
[1:14:41] <BurdRightsActivist> WOW HOLY SHIT
[1:14:48] <%AmericanSkidd> How many were killed by each other?
[1:14:51] <%GabeSweetMan> Not all of them were... but all the good ones died.
[1:14:53] <%cvp5127> YOU DIDNT WIN
[1:14:54] <%charp35> The qurians suck
[1:15:00] <%sporeian94> AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE MOMENT THAT COMPLETELY INVALIDATES THE ENDING
[1:15:01] <%cade_calrayn> or ethically purged
[1:15:02] <secret_npc> They had to, AI is illegal
[1:15:02] <smokios> oh no it's the consequences of my actions
[1:15:03] <DXLelouch24> @mutsu2k hes lying anyways since devs confirmed Shep lives in Destroy which makes no sense cause sheps a cyborg.Ergo Edi and Geth are fine.LOGIC
[1:15:04] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> You get purge and you get a purge
[1:15:04] <%Ipsenscastle> i mean, there were some good Quarians, they're just ... dead. Because Quarians killed them.
[1:15:04] <$Futurecity10> Idology purge not ethnic
[1:15:05] <%JamesCorck> Siding with the Geth on ME3 is a Paragon choice.
[1:15:05] <scrumbotime> They killed anyone sympathetic to the sentient beings they made! And then they went "oh nooooo look what the GETH did!"
[1:15:06] <Profmcstevie> Quarian Deathstar inbound
[1:15:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> To be fair humans would've done the exact same thing
[1:15:07] <TheMostAverageGamer4> javik was based i guess
[1:15:07] <Aoworth> Seems more politically purged but yeah
[1:15:08] <%ahomeschooldropout> Dating Tali is like dating a girl with omega racist parents but like one cool uncle
[1:15:09] <DatAsuna> quarian on quarian violence
[1:15:12] <%maskofmichael> Isn't this stuff we already learned from Legion in ME2?
[1:15:14] <%GabeSweetMan> It's almost like they DIDN'T WANT TO MURDER YOU
[1:15:14] <%ScreamLord> Geth: We wanna be friends with the organics! :D 95% of the Quarians: KILL THEM ALL!
[1:15:14] <Ardailec> More of an ideological purge and not an ethnic purge for the sympathizers but yeah
[1:15:14] <DXLelouch24> @mutsu2k cyborg
[1:15:15] <%dekkitout> Did Futurama have an episode where this was basically the bit
[1:15:16] <Blackleafx> is that tali
[1:15:20] <%TourettesPlays> "You've never heard the legal term Justifiable Genocide?" Norm Macdonald
[1:15:22] <PaperyHornet1013> Quarians are worse than batarians
[1:15:24] <%lumporr> like is there even a fucking word for this? shooting through your own people to kill the slaves
[1:15:25] <%DianaTheAscian> I wonder who killed more Qurians the Geth or themselves
[1:15:29] <+Ancopro> gee quarians why do you get two genocides
[1:15:30] <%maenos2> "so...now what"
[1:15:30] <+NeonLight> Tali is 300+ years old? LUL
[1:15:30] <%DrTomT18> @James_Quivers Given everything that happens in Mass Effect, it seems more likely that the organics would declare war on the Geth than the other way around. The Geth just want to live in peace.
[1:15:30] <DSD24> "What are we gonna do now?"
[1:15:33] <DatAsuna> well not ethnically, but they did purge themselves yes
[1:15:34] <stranger59> The Qurians can have a little ethnic purge, as a treat.
[1:15:40] <$hattrick61> man tali's lucky her hips are a mile wide
[1:15:44] <luftraumm1> is there a parallel possible with the middle east conflicts?  I remember having a clear reading as to that comparison but now I think I was being too lenient
[1:15:49] <%senfood> OF COURSE THEY DID
[1:15:53] <Sp3ctre48> After killing 99% of their population lol
[1:16:02] <%Ipsenscastle> almost as if the entire assumption behind the ending choices is FALSE
[1:16:02] <%sporeian94> DIRECT CONTRADICTION OF ENDING THEMES
[1:16:03] <Aoworth> Geth literally more humane than all organics
[1:16:05] <DSD24> Ewww Cerberus clothes
[1:16:07] <SaltyAzteca> WHY YOU WEARING MY ARMOR LEGION
[1:16:09] <kingra> Legion <3
[1:16:09] <ohno778> it you
[1:16:12] <%AmericanSkidd> Fake, not wearing the right clothes
[1:16:13] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> How far in the game are we?
[1:16:14] <secret_npc> You chose isolation, but won't give them the planet
[1:16:15] <intestinal_bleeding> even Legion wanted to bone
[1:16:16] <studleydoorite> wow so young, look at all that hair
[1:16:19] <%Conscript_Gary> I like how he doesn't include Saren in that reckoning
[1:16:19] <%GabeSweetMan> Literally stronger moral compass than 90% of all cultures that have ever existed.
[1:16:21] <%LeiaSkynoober> I love the geth so much
[1:16:26] <%senfood> @Sp3ctre48 Because the Quarians wouldn't stop trying to genocide them.
[1:16:27] <BurdRightsActivist> <3 Legion I want to fuck your lightbulb facehole <3
[1:16:28] <%Dakuu75> awww, they miss their parents
[1:16:33] <Goraka91> @Sp3ctre48 I wouldn't be surprised if the Quarians nuked themselves like fucking idiots
[1:16:36] <mccf> "how long are young going to hold my hand"
[1:16:37] <intestinal_bleeding> i like legion's little ball dance here
[1:16:37] <%DrTomT18> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH LEGION
[1:16:41] <%LumberjackJack> They're evolving, alright

[1:16:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES SO FUCKING COOL
[1:16:46] <$hattrick61> @intestinal_bleeding a little over half
[1:16:49] <%GabeSweetMan> Legion is such a sweetheart.
[1:16:51] <scrumbotime> the quarians LOVE genocide! They just didn't like that it turned onto them too.
[1:16:51] <AngryAsian5> Love you Legion!
[1:16:54] <stranger59> I never played this, Geth are good bois?
[1:16:55] <santafer> Papa, why are the police waterboarding my fellow geth
[1:16:58] <peachy996> haha dumb robutt fall down
[1:16:58] <heart_raid_> legion is/are the fucking best
[1:17:09] <%GabeSweetMan> WHY
[1:17:09] <DXLelouch24> @ipsenscastle destroy ending, kid lied
[1:17:11] <%senfood> Quarian apologists are hilarious. So blinded by that qussy.
[1:17:11] <luftraumm1> oof you could fuck legion instead of tali would you?
[1:17:13] <cpt_langosta> """"driving them back""""
[1:17:15] <%sporeian94> RUN PAT RUN
[1:17:15] <%topendbuzza> lol
[1:17:18] <%AmericanSkidd> Let him think that
[1:17:18] <Goraka91> They're resisting shut up
[1:17:21] <Treasure_Vault> BUT IT'S CLOSE
[1:17:22] <%JohnAtDawn> Executing. He's executing them
[1:17:23] <James_Quivers> SHoot em anyway, who cares, they're jsut paltforms
[1:17:25] <%cooldude69xx> Does anyone entertain the possibility that the geth are full of shit?
[1:17:25] <%KetsuoTaberu> big man Admiral Gerrell
[1:17:27] <studleydoorite> cut to the admiral piling them up with a space bulldozer
[1:17:28] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Tomato tamatoo
[1:17:30] <@QueequegTheater> KappaHD
[1:17:30] <%kyh9> Quarians are still the worst
[1:17:31] <ShiningAxis> maybe she meant he grabbed the steering wheel
[1:17:31] <%DrTomT18> the ending should have been just killing the Catalyst and nothing else
[1:17:32] <+NeonLight> BibleThump
[1:17:32] <peachy996> @luftraumm1 Can I do it as a dude?
[1:17:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> STOP RESISTING GETH
[1:17:36] <$hattrick61> we're driving their corpses back commander
[1:17:40] <SaltyAzteca> JACK OUT MEGAPAT
[1:17:42] <%kyh9> Quarians need to die
[1:17:46] <%Conscript_Gary> Such a cool mission
[1:17:48] <+ProfessorMorrigan> wait red DOESN'T wipe out inorganics?
[1:17:48] <%cade_calrayn> Deleting archives?
[1:17:48] <ExpressNode> Legion should have used Nord VPN
[1:17:51] <%GuilKato> you should upload a copy of shepard into the geth!
[1:17:54] <%kyh9> I started letting them die, even whenI had the option to broker a peace
[1:17:56] <DatAsuna> This actually doesn't conflict with the ending, but it does reinforce the worst part of ME3 generally. AI and organics will always go to war with each other EXCEPT when shepard's big protagonist dick says no. And that's literally the only way to stop it in countless cycles, have shepard's big plot armoured dick swinging around with mary sue energy.
[1:17:57] <SaltyAzteca> "I know kung fu"
[1:17:58] <luftraumm1> anyway you want @peachy996
[1:17:58] <BoneSkore> toasters can't hope themselves but understand the concept and think it's RAD
[1:17:58] <Goatllama> WHERE'S THE JOKER
[1:18:02] <Sunstalker> The ending should have been Legion suplexign the catalyst and shepard high fiving him
[1:18:05] <Sp3ctre48> red kills robots yes
[1:18:06] <%Aeoneth> Man hearing the Quarian Lady and being unable to seperate her voice from Lakshmi-2 is really fucked up after the last season
[1:18:07] <cpt_langosta> time for some PRIME additions to your war assets
[1:18:08] <%Ipsenscastle> Now Shepard knows Kung-Fu
[1:18:12] <%JoshManVGH> So has anyone pitched a Total Recall situation from this point on?
[1:18:14] <peachy996> @luftraumm1 Tali dies then
[1:18:15] <Goraka91> YEAH THE BOYS
[1:18:19] <+NeonLight> Friends!!
[1:18:19] <DatAsuna> Way too much of ME3 just hinges on shepard being "the coolest guy"
[1:18:19] <intestinal_bleeding> THE SEXBOTS
[1:18:22] <%GabeSweetMan> YEEEEEEEEEEEAAH

[1:18:57] <%Conscript_Gary> THAT IS SUPER FAIR
[1:18:59] <Treasure_Vault> Fair
[1:19:01] <%LumberjackJack> I mean, Legion has a fair point
[1:19:02] <peachy996> good Juggies are mega good buddies in MP

[1:19:15] <secret_npc> Wow I can't believe the Geth are actual fucking monsters
[1:19:20] <+Ches_Neckbeard> the Quarians could've saved themselves by colonizing another planet hundreds of years ago!
[1:19:21] <Goraka91> How dare these evil Geth defend themselves
[1:19:27] <scrumbotime> "Hey Tali, I just literally saw that your race was entirely to blame for what happened to them."
[1:19:27] <intestinal_bleeding> even a reaper has to flinch at a geth prime
[1:19:29] <%kekkerscrew> Everyone loves Legion
[1:19:31] <+ProfessorMorrigan> green ending is so fkn weird man

[1:21:20] <%ChrisPlaysThing> "Unless we die due to a lack of nukes, from nukes!"
[1:21:22] <James_Quivers> Talk to Legion ruh
[1:21:24] <luftraumm1> dev
[1:21:24] <@commanderclaw> Shepard survives the Destroy ending in spite of being a huge cyborg
[1:21:25] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @Ches_Neckbeard @DrTomT18 yeah where is that tag me to
[1:21:27] <$hattrick61> nah thats not how that works
[1:21:30] <%senfood> WHY ARE THE QUARIANS SO SHITTY
[1:21:30] <%GuilKato> go hug legion!
[1:21:32] <peachy996> He means a part of the ending that you can get
[1:21:34] <%dekkitout> Does ME Andromeda say something that canonizes something?
[1:21:34] <Dunmarkh> What did one guy mean by this?
[1:21:35] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Muh legion
[1:21:37] <cpt_langosta> by "dev confirmation" do you mean evidence of story before the rewrites?
[1:21:39] <%maenos2> make sure you talk to edi
[1:21:40] <luftraumm1> I think they mean because of ME4
[1:21:40] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It was all a dream
[1:21:41] <DXLelouch24> Youll see
[1:21:43] <secret_npc> Pat's gonna pick the Green ending like a dummy and turn into a Husk
[1:21:44] <SocialMisfitGamer> @Goraka91 They wanted to burn as many bridges with the Geth as possible, and it's coming back to haunt them
[1:21:45] <LightningLynx89> That’s one guy
[1:21:49] <$hattrick61> legion is in the war room
[1:21:51] <%TourettesPlays> @GustauveVIII Shepard is scoring points with a wide hipped quarian thats the best choice
[1:21:51] <peachy996> @dekkitout Not an ending
[1:21:52] <%Order_of_Mystery> why is Legion the absolute best
[1:21:56] <%sporeian94> THE 3 Bs BOYS
[1:21:57] <28moogles> It's almost like the villain of the series is wrong in his motivation. I don't get why people think "character says thing = game says thing", so frustrating
[1:21:57] <DXLelouch24> Boom
[1:22:01] <%bassoontyphoon> PAt when's the "one guy" emote
[1:22:03] <%GuilKato> Shepards brain function is confirmed by EDI earlier to be fully organic (when discussing transhumanism)
[1:22:05] <%GabeSweetMan> Are we close enough to finish the game on this stream or are we still a couple out?
[1:22:05] <%InternetShis> I thought Destroy just kills reepors
[1:22:07] <%jillyrancher> One last Citadel trip to clean up shit
[1:22:08] <Ekaelis> Man, if Destroy ending is canon in ME4, then all this is pointless.
[1:22:08] <$Falilth> DEV CONFIRMATION : man that's a cool idea wish we had written that ending
[1:22:09] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Fuckin' Fedora wearing Legion
[1:22:10] <%sporeian94> With your special eyes
[1:22:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @secret_npc Nah he said hes gonna do Control
[1:22:13] <%DrTomT18> @Ches_Neckbeard It was in one of the planetary descriptions on a random planet.
[1:22:13] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Shepard only survives Destroy if you have super high War Assets for some reason
[1:22:13] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt hey pat, popping in to ask if you ever had like 30-60 second freezes on deathloop? cause that shit is kinda scary
[1:22:14] <%RealThiele> woolieONEGUY

[1:22:18] <+cermo55> Garrus has best chat with legion
[1:22:19] <DatAsuna> @dekkitout Nah the ark left before ME2 so nothing had to be committed to
[1:22:20] <%maskofmichael> With your special eyes
[1:22:20] <%afronooch> it's not
[1:22:22] <%topendbuzza> your 3rd eye

[1:22:26] <$lotharrio> Mass Effect 4, I guess
[1:22:26] <%ChrisPlaysThing> M'Legion
[1:22:26] <Smokin_Fish> YOU'LL ALL SEE
[1:22:26] <@QueequegTheater> LOOK, WITH YOUR SPECIAL EYES
[1:22:27] <@goose_attack_almanac> Mass Effect was the dream of some guy dying of ryncol poisoning
[1:22:29] <%GabeSweetMan> With YOUR BRAND
[1:22:30] <%afronooch> it's literally big spoils
[1:22:34] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat I think if you use the map on the ship there is an indicator of people to talk with
[1:22:34] <%InternetShis> @bassoontyphoon psa1guy
[1:22:34] <%cooldude69xx> @28moogles Because Character is presented as near omniscient
[1:22:34] <jorniev> WITH BIG EYES
[1:22:35] <LightningLynx89> With your special eyes
[1:22:37] <luftraumm1> you'll see you'll all SEE
[1:22:38] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> You'll see better then Paige
[1:22:42] <knight_verse> @internetshis Destroy kills anything eith Reaper codes.
[1:22:44] <%senfood> Shepard: "Hey, geth. We won't genocide you." Geth: "Cool, we'll join your war effort." Quarians: "?!?!?!?!"
[1:22:46] <%Rookie_Balboa> So why is the Indoctrination theory even being considered when it's confirmed by writers that it is Not A Thing at all
[1:22:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dxlelouch24 Hes doing Control bruh
[1:22:49] <%count1999> WITH YOUR SPECIAL EYES PAT
[1:22:51] <%Cerabret100> @PatStaresAt PS5 i had full on freeze twice, and reddit seems to have people confirming the same
[1:22:53] <%THATGUY_789> chuggins
[1:22:54] <secret_npc> Destroy is the only non-bitch ending
[1:22:55] <%bassoontyphoon> @InternetShis wow im dumb
[1:22:57] <cpt_langosta> Giuliani invading? I hope not!
[1:22:58] <%GabeSweetMan> Has Paige gotten her new glasses in??
[1:22:59] <%cade_calrayn> I had that happen in an early loop about 3 times in a row but since then nothing
[1:22:59] <DSD24> For the Qussy?
[1:22:59] <%Ipsenscastle> @28moogles because the game presents it as inarguable truth and you don't get any opportunity to reject the claim other than the bad ending
[1:23:01] <%maenos2> LUL
[1:23:03] <olm46> Thirsty for qussy
[1:23:05] <Aoworth> Thirsty for Legion's ROBOASS
[1:23:05] <SaltyAzteca> Ohhhhhhh sassy
[1:23:05] <intestinal_bleeding> THIRSTY
[1:23:07] <%cooldude69xx> @QueequegTheater I like to imagine  thats because its the true ending
[1:23:08] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Just beat Grime earlier tonight. Thanks a million for showing me the game.
[1:23:10] <%topendbuzza> edi hates you
[1:23:11] <%ape_hawk> EDI just quipped
[1:23:12] <%InternetShis> No.
[1:23:15] <%sporeian94> I remember when the ending controversy was happening people theorized shepard never left the geth consensus and is under Reaper spell
[1:23:16] <%RealThiele> sassy bot
[1:23:18] <Treasure_Vault> Couldn't EDI go in easier than anyone?
[1:23:18] <%LumberjackJack> Thirsty for Legion's Gussy
[1:23:20] <DatAsuna> F
[1:23:20] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[1:23:23] <%unhuggable1> wait so did they say which ending was canon or no
[1:23:23] <+xcompleasedad> @QueequegTheater Has he gotten to EDI's bit about the survivors from Earth yet?
[1:23:24] <%KetsuoTaberu> oh no
[1:23:25] <luftraumm1> because indoctrination theory sounds way better than what came out
[1:23:26] <intestinal_bleeding> shepherd when INSIDE the geth
[1:23:27] <BurdRightsActivist> VRCHAT
[1:23:27] <$lotharrio> "I got out bleep boop blip blip boop, right Joker?"
[1:23:27] <scrumbotime> Fair assessment Joker.
[1:23:27] <%senfood> Shut the fuck up, Joker.
[1:23:29] <%Mattais88> awww, I missed it...
[1:23:30] <notsoy> fucking joker lmao
[1:23:30] <%AmericanSkidd> naw
[1:23:30] <%Order_of_Mystery> Shepherd gave the Geth a Whif, and that was all they needed to be cool with organics
[1:23:30] <Treasure_Vault> Wait this is the best ending explanation
[1:23:32] <@QueequegTheater> @xcompleasedad Don't think so
[1:23:32] <SaltyAzteca> YOU THINK THATS AIR YOUR BREATHING

[1:23:39] <Ner234> I mean
[1:23:39] <lloyddboy> MASS EFFECT 4
[1:23:40] <%sporeian94> A MATRIX INSIDE A MATRIX
[1:23:40] <%DrTomT18> Legion wouldn't do that to you
[1:23:41] <DXLelouch24> @ballerswagbro9k cant fuck Tali tho so controls not happening for him, think bout it
[1:23:41] <Treasure_Vault> No wonder the ending sucks
[1:23:41] <%RealThiele> I mean shes learning jokes from Seth Green
[1:23:42] <%jillyrancher> Shut up Joker
[1:23:42] <%topendbuzza> sure it could
[1:23:43] <santafer> thanks, joker
[1:23:43] <luftraumm1> legions has a port, not a gussy
[1:23:44] <ne0bunny> what if...this was a video game!?
[1:23:44] <notsoy> THERE IS NO SPOON
[1:23:44] <%Ipsenscastle> he figured it out
[1:23:44] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> Joker stop lol
[1:23:44] <+BigCoffee> maybe
[1:23:45] <Drunkengen> MAYBE THATS WHY THE EDING IS BAD
[1:23:46] <$lotharrio> No... Shep is real. He HAS to be.
[1:23:46] <%Rumbutt> YOU'RE THE ONE PAT
[1:23:46] <@QueequegTheater> God damn you Joker
[1:23:48] <%LumberjackJack> WAIT, WHAT IS CHAT IS JUST A SIMULATION
[1:23:48] <ohno778> DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
[1:23:49] <scrumbotime> Shepard doesn't care, he will eat that juicy steak
[1:23:50] <TioXyco> IMPASTABLE!
[1:23:52] <+BigCoffee> Go fuck Tali to make usre
[1:23:52] <%maenos2> I'd hope a simulation would give me a bigger dick
[1:23:53] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> "Dude! What if the Geth is everyone's minds?!"
[1:23:53] <%GuilKato> if only! that would mean the ending was a geth simulation!
[1:23:55] <BurdRightsActivist> JOKER FIGURED IT OUT
[1:24:01] <olm46> The geth consensus sure did a bad job imitating an ending.
[1:24:01] <%Conscript_Gary> The geth couldhn't reproduce your sense of humor, Joker
[1:24:02] <+BlooBirdo> the real indoctrination was the indoctrination that we had all along : D
[1:24:03] <@ssjklyco> 2 years worth of pent up lust into his geth lover in the  geth SAO VR,
[1:24:03] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Solipism
[1:24:04] <%captain_thickthighs> Take the red pill shepard we have to stop the liberals
[1:24:04] <$Solid_Stro> Pat knows too much
[1:24:04] <notsoy> TALK TO LEGION PLS
[1:24:04] <%DrTomT18> TALK TO LEGION?
[1:24:05] <%twistedj3ster> What does Tasty Wheat really taste like?
[1:24:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GETH SIMULATION THEORY
[1:24:07] <Dunmarkh> talk to legion
[1:24:07] <%TourettesPlays> that could have been a much worse "lampshading that you're playing a video game" joke
[1:24:08] <@Ranryu692> it's almost like Ozymandias was right
[1:24:08] <Laecerelius> The ending is bad because teh Geth couldn't calculate a good enough ending!
[1:24:11] <%GabeSweetMan> "What if we're the vidyagame?"
[1:24:11] <ammobasket> We never left the consensus!!!
[1:24:14] <ohno778> cute british lesbian
[1:24:15] <%kingmemelord97> thats just a theory a GAME THEORY
[1:24:16] <%GuilKato> Hug legion!

[1:24:19] <roboyuji> What if it were all a videogame!?!
[1:24:20] <PaperyHornet1013> Joker just canonically spoiled the ending
[1:24:20] <%maskofmichael> @LumberjackJack Yes, we are all just Woolie posting really fast
[1:24:20] <%Order_of_Mystery> go smooch legion, quickly now!
[1:24:23] <%kekkerscrew> It's our BOY
[1:24:23] <$lotharrio> If Shep is still in the VR, then that means the Geth are programming him giving Tali numerous infections with his penis.
[1:24:24] <%GabeSweetMan> Must smooth robot!
[1:24:28] <%cooldude69xx> He didnt want to talk to him
[1:24:29] <%Mattais88> What if everything from Eden Prime on was all Shepard hallucinating at the beacon?
[1:24:31] <James_Quivers> @lloyddboy I unironically think they could do something where Shepard's consciousness was saved after going into the consensus, therefore, they can use that to 'bring him back to life'
[1:24:35] <%GabeSweetMan> KISS HIM
[1:24:49] <BoneSkore> Jokerr don't...
[1:24:50] <Laecerelius> Tali, get out of the way!  I gotta go talk to our son!
[1:24:56] <%LumberjackJack> Coo shit
[1:25:00] <ohno778> HEADPATS FOR LEGION
[1:25:01] <blackjack8182> Now kiss
[1:25:02] <cpt_langosta> suck on his antenna
[1:25:07] <+healnavi> How far away is the ending

[1:25:11] <%cooldude69xx> @lloyddboy I hope Shepard is dead and we get a new protagonist named after a spaceman we already have

[1:46:22] <%JoshManVGH> Cheer500 Hey Pat, the vaccines got renamed because those are the manufacturer chosen brand names. That's right, marketing changed the name. The decisions for the Pfizer name Comirnaty, apparently came from a brand institute who thought to combine "community" "mRNA" and "immunity"... co-MEER-nity. I think Moderna won out on this one, SPIKEVAX!
[1:46:25] <DSD24> That's the multiplayer everyone
[1:46:26] <blackjack8182> Good job 👶
[1:46:27] <%dooscent> @hazmatwonder yeah it's just a multiplayer map intro

[1:55:11] <%SpcOpsBear> @hassanico2 actually no they rebalanced it around the 50% rate
[1:55:12] <%cvp5127> natural selection
[1:55:17] <%NeoCre> @doc_ock_rokc That doesn’t matter. Doctors are not proscribing it for Covid (because of course not) so people are self-medicating with horse dewormer. Learn  wtf is going on before talking out of ass
[1:55:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @trashmanasam ITs the same chemical
[1:55:19] <%RealThiele> COMPASSION FATIGUE GO BRRRR

[1:55:37] <hassanico2> I know Feel got denied the Neutral ending and he did most everything
[1:55:39] <$lotharrio> I keep seeing those stories, yeah.
[1:55:41] <jorniev> DIE
[1:55:42] <%jillyrancher> I'm so tired
[1:55:43] <%cvp5127> let natural selection do its job
[1:55:43] <notsoy> play stupid games, win stupid prizes
[1:55:44] <Ravioli_Ronin> NO THEY’RE NOT. THEY’RE TAKING UP ICU SPACE
[1:55:45] <%RealThiele> IM GOING YEAH
[1:55:46] <%GabeSweetMan> Don't wish death on others basically but also nature runs it's course.
[1:55:46] <smokios> i get that
[1:55:47] <%Mattais88> Howard Stern apparently was shitting on Joe Rogan the other day
[1:55:50] <Profmcstevie> I'm not wasting hospital beds on you
[1:55:53] <+wmeldrum> NO SIMPY
[1:55:54] <%toolofparanoia> i say let nature take its course
[1:55:56] <%kingmemelord97> all right chat calm murder boner down
[1:55:57] <digaogrunge> I feel bad for them, the stupid and fearful are people too
[1:55:59] <Latija> they're just saying that outloud
[1:56:00] <+vdalson> it just sucks when they're taking up emergency beds with their stupidity from other people who need it
[1:56:00] <MrNoobMcSalt> that's a warm feeling right in my heart
[1:56:00] <%tusk102> jesus
[1:56:02] <count_bob> OOOOF
[1:56:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> @NeoCre They are, All over the US and EU its a woderful drug that won a Nobel prize and has a ton of uses.
[1:56:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Oh i never feel bad for stupids dying to their own stupid.
[1:56:04] <DatAsuna> the waitress is right there jeff
[1:56:08] <DXLelouch24> Can we atleast kick them in the balls or pussy for each medical treatment
[1:56:08] <QuestlordJake> they would try
[1:56:08] <peachy996> It'd be awkward to introduce Edi as "This is my fuckbot"
[1:56:10] <%blue8moon> there is a stripper next to you while you are having that conversation
[1:56:13] <+trashmanasam> @doc_ock_rokc yea and chrolines in salt i dont drink pool water to taste it
[1:56:13] <Dabrikishaw> I don't pop champagne. I don't pump my fist and do a victory lap. I do give an exaggerated shrug and say "If only there was something they could have done to prevent this" (See, because there was something they could have done, and they didn't, because they're brainwashed trumpers who can't admit that they were wrong.)
[1:56:14] <%toolofparanoia> or force them to get the vaccine
[1:56:16] <%RealThiele> is it murder boner if the idiots eat the horse paste to death
[1:56:19] <%JoshManVGH> @doc_ock_rokc yeah but the trials for ivermectin to treat covid are totally sus, and thusfar wholey unproven. But it's being backed by a thinktank that refuses to let it go. That and the conversation has pushed people to buy horse sized doses because their doctors wont write them a perscription.
[1:56:20] <%toolofparanoia> put it in the water supply
[1:56:21] <Ravioli_Ronin> Vaxxed lives > antivaxxers
[1:56:22] <%jillyrancher> remember the guy who died from a heart attack cause he couldn't get treated cause of anti vaxxers getting suck
[1:56:23] <macathelo> and we don't any cientific evidence that invermstuff works on covid
[1:56:23] <ExpressNode> Been seeing a lot of news lately about deaths of people who didn't believe the virus existed this week

[1:57:05] <James_Quivers> I just don't take any sort of positive emotion from anyone who isn't a murder or rapist dying because I have morals
[1:57:11] <olaksi> pretty sure the bouncer throws you out if you try to clip into a stripper
[1:57:11] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt you don't have that item until after rannoch
[1:57:12] <Treasure_Vault> What would make a Star Trek game good? Hours of uneventful warp while you talk to another engineer in the mess hall?
[1:57:15] <%JoshManVGH> it's just a bad time overall, but there's a great Behind the Bastards episode on Ivermectin.
[1:57:16] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @peachy996 every conversation after, "i cum buckets n this thing every we3ek" is easy
[1:57:16] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat TALK TO MIRANDA AT PRESIDIUM ITS IMPORTANT KomodoHype
[1:57:24] <%cooldude69xx> @jorniev "You're just trying to TRICK me with the lifesaving needle"
[1:57:31] <%Conscript_Gary> Play Bridge Commander, that's what a good Star Trek game looks like
[1:57:34] <%bassoontyphoon> Talk to Miranda pat
[1:57:34] <@Ranryu692> yeah it's her, but you don't have it yet

[1:57:52] <xeros720> @doc_ock_rokc No matter what you say, the vaccine is better, it's free, and it's safe. You can't argue against that because if you do, you'll seem insane. So stop pretending you have an actual point.
[1:57:54] <%toolofparanoia> BIG WAR
[1:57:54] <ghosrevan> pat you should talk to miranda

[1:58:26] <%AmericanSkidd> more than 1 or 2
[1:58:28] <DatAsuna> you can basically only get the bad end by deliberately avoiding every sidequest
[1:58:29] <%sporeian94> Talk to miranda righ fucking now pat
[1:58:29] <Treasure_Vault> @Treasure_Vault You talk about the ethical quandary for three ingame days.

[1:58:34] <%Conscript_Gary> It's super classified, you can't just look it up on your personal device
[1:58:41] <Profmcstevie> Just open a PDA of "war progress"
[1:58:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @JoshManVGH 7 a side effect of it is the alivation of fluid in lungs which is what the perscription is for. AND it should be noted that Oklahoma never had a increase patients that was false news

[2:00:06] <%jillyrancher> Miranda is cool quit hatin
[2:00:08] <cpt_langosta> when you find out why, it literally makes no sense why she couldn't tell you
[2:00:10] <DXLelouch24> Give it to her
[2:00:16] <Treasure_Vault> Why does her face look like that?
[2:00:17] <%retrosadness> i bet she totally could have told you
[2:00:18] <SaltyAzteca> @jillyrancher CerberASS Kappa

[2:00:49] <%Mattais88> And........?
[2:00:49] <%jillyrancher> She apolgizin
[2:00:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @luftraumm1 ITS NOT ABOUT ANTI VIRAL its about treating a symptom that is fatal. a side effect is that it drains fluid build up in lungs.
[2:00:49] <James_Quivers> What most people don't understand is that most of those who don't want a vax aren't doing so due to not 'trusting the science', it's because they don't trust big pharma and the government, which is more reasonable
[2:00:53] <Treasure_Vault> Ok,so?
[2:00:53] <AngryAsian5> I think you told us that too
[2:00:58] <%AmericanSkidd> Really early on
[2:00:59] <%jillyrancher> sorry for being so evil
[2:01:03] <Dabrikishaw> Oh right, this is for people to played Mass Effect 3 first

[2:03:00] <CrimsonGargoyle> "I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN ARTHUR" - Miranda
[2:03:06] <%RealThiele> Being technically right that Imervectin has a human use misses the point of what is actually happening now

[2:03:30] <%InternetShis> "I have a plan, Shepard"

[2:12:21] <+CyanDeadEye> @Maids4lyfe Long-range control was destroyed with the dreadnought, taking out the base is for short-range.

[2:12:31] <%chiazam> @Maids4lyfe for the lulz. and also because Pat trying to overcome his easy-mode fear
[2:12:32] <@commanderclaw> IMO you should play on the difficulty that challenges you but doesn't fuck your ass raw
[2:12:34] <%LordMoonIV> new twitter protagonist?
[2:12:35] <%AmericanSkidd> oh I see
[2:12:40] <mikeriffic> I mean I prefer more challenging difficulties but its all about having fun. Who ever is playing

[2:12:47] <%WutangchickeN> the only reason to resent your kids is if they refuse to bankrupt themselves to send you to Mars.

[2:13:00] <Maids4lyfe> makes sense to me
[2:13:00] <%AmericanSkidd> Asking chat is HARD MODE
[2:13:01] <SaltyAzteca> No he has a schedule, so he needs to WRAP IT UP
[2:13:01] <%dekkitout> To quote Chapelle Show "WRAP IT UP"
[2:13:03] <Sp3ctre48> No one is watching this for the gameplay so do what you want
[2:13:04] <%GabeSweetMan> So hang on where's this article??
[2:13:05] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> a little baby never hurt anyone

[2:13:32] <%ape_hawk> "im playing mass effect on baby mode" *crashes in background*
[2:13:32] <%Mattais88> Paige is angry about difficulty settings
[2:13:32] <ExpressNode> Gravity is her worse enemy
[2:13:35] <%tusk102> paige just fucking exploded
[2:13:35] <%maskofmichael> Can you put Paige on Baby Mode?
[2:13:36] <%AmericanSkidd> the goblins
[2:13:38] <%GabeSweetMan> @JoshManVGH Thank ya kindly
[2:13:38] <%TheWinged7> so nothing has changed
[2:13:38] <%RetroCop87> Did Paige just tip furniture in anger at you playing easy mode?
[2:13:38] <PerfectPepperPlantPro> Babymode cant save you from navigation though
[2:13:39] <mr_saturday93> What bone did she break THIS TIME?
[2:13:40] <%MelBrooksKA> Pat, you do have a diaper
[2:13:42] <DXLelouch24> @futurecity10 no Woolie would NEVER let him hear the end if it if he played a DMC on easy mode
[2:13:45] <%afronooch> pst doesnt love us enough to call us babe :(
[2:13:45] <smokios> im used to it
[2:13:45] <mikeriffic> but you were just taling to us
[2:13:46] <Sp3ctre48> I can't believe Paige spontaneously combusted
[2:13:47] <blackjack8182> Paige took the news hard
[2:13:47] <akitanito> I'm sorry I'm here
[2:13:47] <Srthunda> oh I feel so included
[2:13:47] <%JoshManVGH> Just a normal explosion in the background
[2:13:48] <%king_wragles> "I WANTED TO INCLUDE YOU GUYS"
[2:13:49] <PaperyHornet1013> DEAD
[2:13:50] <Ekaelis> That's what fanfic about Shepard depict his combat prowess
[2:13:51] <LightningLynx89> Pat has become Superman truly with his big diaper
[2:13:55] <OneThousandTomatoes> the """chat"""
[2:14:00] <peachy996> No worries, I still feel included even thou you forgot I existed :)
[2:14:01] <leinadtonu> I am using the mod toy box to play the new Pathfinder and cheating has made me enjoy the game a thousand times more.
[2:14:01] <%CasualSleepyGamer> "You baby for listening to chat, also why you no listen to chat when we tell you where something is?!"
[2:14:02] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Pat seriously I doubt anyone cares what difficulty your own we like you for you
[2:14:15] <$Futurecity10> both
[2:14:15] <TioXyco> yes
[2:14:15] <jorniev> PAT: hi paige                                            paige: *crashes thought the wall*
[2:14:15] <%LordMoonIV> become the diaper?
[2:14:19] <mr_saturday93> yes
[2:14:20] <%Broand> I mean it makes sense that if you're not really enjoying the normal mode process, you should probably play it on an easier setting and then work your way up as you get a handle on the mechanics.
[2:14:21] <%dekkitout> Totally
[2:14:21] <%tusk102> oh god
[2:14:22] <%MelBrooksKA> Both
[2:14:22] <Srthunda> yes
[2:14:23] <%RealThiele> Yes
[2:14:24] <medoodoo> no
[2:14:24] <%jillyrancher> This music rules
[2:14:25] <Treasure_Vault> Superman doesnt poop
[2:14:25] <%ape_hawk> yes
[2:14:26] <%afronooch> absolutely
[2:14:27] <%AmericanSkidd> explode the toilet
[2:14:27] <%topendbuzza> sure
[2:14:28] <+xcompleasedad> MAybe?
[2:14:29] <%NateyBeak> do you think superman enjoys pissing his pants cuz he likes the warm feeling?
[2:14:29] <%Mattais88> No, it was probably an outhouse
[2:14:31] <ghosrevan> superman dosent dump i think
[2:14:31] <%twistedj3ster> he said krakatoea
[2:14:32] <%JoshManVGH> What if it just comes out as a gem?
[2:14:32] <Maids4lyfe> yes
[2:14:33] <%dekkitout> He crushed doorknobs, so ye
[2:14:34] <%Rumbutt> super sonic shits
[2:14:34] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt read Niven's "Man of Steel, Woman of Tissue Paper"
[2:14:34] <OneThousandTomatoes> no
[2:14:34] <Jmann1892> Yes
[2:14:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> please stop
[2:14:36] <akitanito> "Kent! Not again!"
[2:14:37] <superchunk121> Do you think he can store the poop for months?
[2:14:38] <Treasure_Vault> Superman's first power is no pooping
[2:14:38] <%maskofmichael> One of Supermans powers is not needing to poop
[2:14:38] <secret_npc> Very good music
[2:14:38] <digaogrunge> of course
[2:14:39] <+OneGorillionDollars> absolutely
[2:14:41] <+Nightwolf656> LUL
[2:14:41] <%THATGUY_789> why is it that everytime paige enters the room she crashes in like the like the cool aid jug
[2:14:43] <Maids4lyfe> his piss would cut through steel
[2:14:43] <%RealThiele> Supersonic pissing
[2:14:44] <%ape_hawk> thats why he shits in a foxhole from now on
[2:14:45] <mr_saturday93> Better question does his farts cause nuclear explosions?
[2:14:46] <valriot> MAN OF STOOL
[2:14:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt he's from kansas farm so i dont doubt he used an outhouse
[2:14:47] <%LordMoonIV> is the diaper sentient in the situation?
[2:14:48] <%topendbuzza> @twistedj3ster LUL
[2:14:48] <%barrakuta371> Why do you think he has the Fotress of Solitude?
[2:14:48] <%Rumbutt> breaking the sound barrier with his turds
[2:14:52] <blackjack8182> Pat’s deflecting
[2:14:53] <LightningLynx89> No. Because he poops normally
[2:14:53] <%WutangchickeN> he shat so hard it carved MARTHA into the earth
[2:14:55] <%DoubleRrico> is that where brown kryptonite comes from?
[2:14:56] <%stantheman_97> does superman get super hemorrhoids?
[2:14:57] <%Rumbutt> farts with sonic booms
[2:14:58] <xeros720> i wonder if he'd have a super shit or his super stomach turns everything into atoms
[2:14:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Superman poops in the sun
[2:14:59] <TioXyco> titanium piercing piss, like chuck norris
[2:15:01] <secret_npc> Right???
[2:15:03] <%AncelDeLambert> I doubt very strongly that mere organic matter would be capable of withstanding the kind of pressure Superman's colon can exert
[2:15:04] <%JoshManVGH> His sphincter will crush food into crystaline strictures!
[2:15:05] <Laecerelius> Wow, his shields are basically unbreakable
[2:15:07] <DXLelouch24> Pat hes born with powers, hes a damn Alien
[2:15:08] <digaogrunge> One time supes camed and killed a guy
[2:15:09] <mikeriffic> @PatStaresAt have you seen the robot chicken where Superman kills lois with his penis projectiles?
[2:15:11] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah it's making the Valiant look like it actually does damage Keepo
[2:15:12] <chainsaw105> da baby?
[2:15:12] <%dekkitout> Teen Clark jerking it after he got his powers must've been an ordeal
[2:15:12] <ExpressNode> The vibrations of his ass cheeks clapping probably broke the toilet
[2:15:14] <Ekaelis> I feel bad watching Geth getting bodied like this.
[2:15:14] <Dunmarkh> You turned this game into a point and click adventure
[2:15:16] <jorniev> tomorrow is the deltarune stream right?
[2:15:19] <notsoy> lol that rocket tickled
[2:15:21] <secret_npc> I play Baby Mode all the time, I get so much done
[2:15:21] <+xcompleasedad> YYEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS
[2:15:22] <DSD24> YES
[2:15:23] <%LordMoonIV> HELL YEAH
[2:15:24] <Sp3ctre48> BEST GUN IN THE GAME
[2:15:25] <ravemax1> play on the difficulty that  is most fun for you and if you need to cheat then fucking cheat
[2:15:25] <+xcompleasedad> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:15:25] <%DoubleRrico> the return!
[2:15:27] <%NeoCre> This is the Action Hero difficulty
[2:15:28] <BigFingerRo> Does the baby mode make you feel like a big strong man, Pat?
[2:15:28] <%tusk102> LOOK AT HOW LITTLE IS SHIELD WENT DOWN FROM THE ROCKET
[2:15:30] <+xcompleasedad> BEST FUCKING GUN
[2:15:31] <xeros720> hell yeah, geth weapons, i never got these in multi
[2:15:33] <DSD24> I love the best shotgun
[2:15:33] <medoodoo> Pat's chirpy today
[2:15:34] <LightningLynx89> Your barrier just doesn’t go down
[2:15:36] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt is this whole "guide thing" a catalyst for your mid-life crisis?
[2:15:37] <GustauveVIII> why not just run past everything and see if you can break the game?
[2:15:38] <Rao2357> eh depending on the continuity it takes him several years to soak up enough sun to get all suped up
[2:15:40] <%Mattais88> Good Call
[2:15:41] <%AncelDeLambert> the more likely option is that Superman can eat anything and not get hemorroids
[2:15:44] <%ape_hawk> thats safe
[2:15:44] <peachy996> Why not change it now? The game is so easy you can ue it effectively
[2:15:46] <SaltyAzteca> Thats COMPLETELY understandable
[2:15:47] <%THATGUY_789> good choice
[2:15:50] <%WutangchickeN> is that a euphemism???
[2:15:50] <%DrTomT18> why?
[2:15:51] <%topendbuzza> thats rule 7
[2:15:51] <ghosrevan> shepard commander do you need assistance with tail?
[2:15:51] <%tusk102> preemptive saving? @PatStaresAt
[2:15:54] <Sp3ctre48> Well best gun if you're playing on host anyway
[2:15:56] <%RealThiele> horror movie inc
[2:15:57] <alrobot2014> oh god that sounds terrifying
[2:15:59] <%Agami23> thats understandable
[2:16:02] <%jillyrancher> That's as funny as the joke everyone makes that Superman killed Lois by giving her a cumshot in her mouth
[2:16:03] <%LumberjackJack> Pat, you kinda talked over a key development moment
[2:16:03] <%AmericanSkidd> wut
[2:16:04] <DXLelouch24> Easy mode is Pat just having a mid life crisis
[2:16:05] <akitanito> WHY?!
[2:16:06] <%Dakuu75> ... um...
[2:16:06] <%DracosMagala> She's THAT clumsy???
[2:16:08] <+Shockrates20XX> Do you think she's gonna get sucked in?
[2:16:11] <Sp3ctre48> why would you do that
[2:16:11] <%maenos2> can she use a blender?
[2:16:12] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> huh??
[2:16:12] <%LordMoonIV> ALWAYS lock out your equipment
[2:16:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> I almost chopped my finger off with a hatchet once, it sucked
[2:16:17] <%dekkitout> You weren't a young man if you didn't almost lost a digit/limb
[2:16:19] <%TourettesPlays> and thats why Pat hates Sonic the Hedgehog
[2:16:19] <%jillyrancher> Paige cant touch complex technology
[2:16:21] <%RetroCop87> After watching that one scene from HEROS, I'm terrified to use the sink disposal
[2:16:25] <Srthunda> just buy her a parrot then

[2:26:42] <akitanito> I like how you can just sidestep a bit
[2:26:43] <Parapattern> This things targeting system is shit
[2:26:46] <%InternetShis> I love the sound design of the laser closing in
[2:26:46] <%GabeSweetMan> The audio design is so damn good.
[2:26:46] <Aoworth> Why can't it shoot the laser directly at you
[2:26:47] <SaltyAzteca> IT LOADS SO FAST
[2:26:50] <LightningLynx89> Reaper’s sound so cool
[2:26:52] <Sp3ctre48> *Robot sounds*

[2:27:04] <cpt_langosta> they didn't render a damage model
[2:27:06] <+CyanDeadEye> Isn't it a lot faster on higher difficulties?
[2:27:08] <%LumberjackJack> 14 months, Pat
[2:27:09] <James_Quivers> The insides are all gooey now tho
[2:27:10] <%AncelDeLambert> you'd think this part would be cooler
[2:27:10] <%RealThiele> damage costs money and time
[2:27:11] <Laecerelius> You'd think that after enough shots it'd just ignore using the fucking laser and stomp on you instead
[2:27:12] <%InternetShis> Oh yeah?
[2:27:12] <scrumbotime> you're cooking it from the inside out
[2:27:13] <Goraka91> Big hero
[2:27:15] <James_Quivers> SLOMO

[2:27:34] <%MisterRockett> No that's what the aiming is for.
[2:27:35] <%AncelDeLambert> the concussion should annihilate you, yes
[2:27:37] <Treasure_Vault> No they had a laser target
[2:27:37] <Parapattern> That would obliterate the entire area
[2:27:39] <Treasure_Vault> it's fine
[2:27:39] <scrumbotime> shepard should absolutely be jello
[2:27:39] <%dooscent> this part kicks ass though

[2:35:04] <+CyanDeadEye> I always liked the way the Geth commit their forces to you.
[2:35:08] <%SpcOpsBear> "We" are Legion.
[2:35:14] <%SpcOpsBear> We are ALL Legion.
[2:35:14] <%CasualSleepyGamer> "What would Legion do?"
[2:35:15] <%machshop> region lmao
[2:35:16] <%senfood> Imagine if they'd done this A THOUSAND FUCKING YEARS AGO
[2:35:16] <%InternetShis> @akitanito They're individuals now
[2:35:18] <secret_npc> Look at this lame baby shit
[2:35:18] <@Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt who do you want to smooch more, Legion, or Cain from Binary Domain?
[2:35:18] <scrumbotime> CAN NEVER COEXIST

[2:35:23] <Treasure_Vault> No way to cooperate
[2:35:23] <ErikFeral> Tali was still holding her gun up nearly that whole time...
[2:35:24] <scrumbotime> Never!
[2:35:24] <%Deadpal> MAN IT SUCKS THAT THE ENDING REMOVES THE POINT OF THIS.
[2:35:25] <Virokwet> no way no how
[2:35:26] <%DrTomT18> Friendship is magic
[2:35:26] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> theres just no way...
[2:35:26] <%LumberjackJack> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, TOTALLY
[2:35:26] <xeros720> aahahahaha, oh man
[2:35:27] <dd44dostivei> are geth magic minorities
[2:35:27] <sun312772> Idiot Gerrel

[2:35:28] <jorniev> REGIS
[2:35:28] <%CapnBeefs> Dammit, just wish legion didn't have to die for this
[2:35:29] <Laecerelius> Now fuck that giant robot man, Raan.  Size difference!
[2:35:29] <Vinicius_75> man this makes the ending suck soooo bad
[2:35:30] <Sunstalker> Legion became legion BibleThump
[2:35:30] <+ProfessorMorrigan> can't be done, Pat.

[2:35:31] <CanadianAdam> I am Legion
[2:35:31] <spuginky> wow we just solved racism
[2:35:31] <Parapattern> NEVER EVER NEVER
[2:35:32] <xeros720> this is hilarious now
[2:35:32] <%JamesCorck> ending trivialised.
[2:35:32] <%Conscript_Gary> Hee, this is cute
[2:35:33] <peachy996> Not without some sort of special human space jesus
[2:35:33] <%kingmemelord97> !uptime
[2:35:34] <@Moobot> @kingmemelord97 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 35m.
[2:35:34] <DSD24> Look at these two dorks
[2:35:35] <%unhuggable1> that was so easy
[2:35:35] <santafer> First quarian to have sex in rannoch
[2:35:36] <mikeriffic> The geth are suppper cool, not only do they not want to fight, they WANT to help
[2:35:36] <%Deadpal> yeeeeeeeeeeeep.
[2:35:37] <%afronooch> Yep
[2:35:37] <+xcompleasedad> Literally the Quarians tried to kill an entire race of robot waifus and husbandos because they didn't want to pay them
[2:35:38] <intestinal_bleeding> time for funny line
[2:35:39] <%PunchSlugfest> yep lol
[2:35:39] <IntrepidEye> To be fair it did require Shepards talk no jutsu
[2:35:40] <%AncelDeLambert> not only can they coexist they can become SYMBIOTIC god the Reaper plot sucks
[2:35:40] <ZippierJosh> can we end the game here lol
[2:35:40] <secret_npc> Nah, the Reapers totally did all this shit too, you're just repeating history
[2:35:40] <LightningLynx89> Can’t be done Pat
[2:35:41] <%DrTomT18> tell me about it
[2:35:41] <banananutcake> why are aliens using so much human terms
[2:35:42] <Dabrikishaw> This is the most feel good moment next to the genophage cure
[2:35:42] <%cobalt_phoenix_> RIGHT?
[2:35:42] <SaltyAzteca> NO SHU UP THO
[2:35:42] <+cactusplasma> the real Legion was the friends we made along the way
[2:35:43] <+ProfessorMorrigan> it is wild
[2:35:43] <Virokwet> i know
[2:35:44] <%Rumbutt> exactly
[2:35:45] <%SABiscotti> Yeah it's kinda fucked, huh?
[2:35:46] <%GabeSweetMan> IT COULD NEVER WORK
[2:35:46] <%Varlinator> 1 of the endings
[2:35:47] <%GuilKato> she had a geth husbando now
[2:35:48] <%Aleate> RIGHT?
[2:35:49] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> yea lol
[2:35:49] <PaperyHornet1013> FOR A WEEK
[2:35:50] <secret_npc> I destroyed the Geth, the ending made way more sense
[2:35:51] <%AmericanSkidd> it may as well not even be in thesame game
[2:35:52] <%Bailey__gaming> Robot Sexytimes
[2:35:53] <%unhuggable1> this should have been the ending
[2:35:55] <snivins> is even a good point for machines to not hate all their creators
[2:35:55] <%AncelDeLambert> now you see why so many of us hate this game, Pat
[2:35:55] <BigFingerRo> you sure?
[2:35:56] <Brandon__Brando> now he see's
[2:35:57] <olaksi> the fact the geth had to become individuals feels really dumbed down, like we can't understand their values if they aren't humans
[2:35:57] <%captain_thickthighs> we solved space Israel!!!
[2:35:57] <%kyh9> Tell her to fuck off
[2:35:57] <blackjack8182> It’s crazy
[2:35:58] <%GabeSweetMan> KAI LENG
[2:35:58] <%RoldanDgr8> you mean the original ending?
[2:35:59] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> I'm kinda excited to see this infamous ending now
[2:35:59] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Ending isn't canon as far as I'm concerned
[2:36:00] <cpt_langosta> binary domain?
[2:36:00] <%InternetShis> It's almost like Casey Hudson is a hack and a fraud
[2:36:02] <%hairtoday> "it will not last" said the starchild
[2:36:02] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> It's like playing GOT
[2:36:03] <%RealThiele> ok
[2:36:05] <%DrTomT18> IT'S LIKE THE ENDING WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE
[2:36:07] <knight_verse> That's not the point of the conflict.... but ok.
[2:36:08] <%AncelDeLambert> like, there was a REASON we all hated this after the ending
[2:36:08] <%DrTomT18> RIP DARK MATTER
[2:36:11] <akitanito> binary domain was great
[2:36:12] <%GabeSweetMan> Wife.
[2:36:13] <mandorlalmond> its bc shepard is a 10 old boy dreaming all along
[2:36:13] <intestinal_bleeding> I respect that qurian ASSS
[2:36:15] <%LumberjackJack> It's why the hatred for the ending was so loud. You play the game, and that ending makes no goddamn sense
[2:36:17] <@commanderclaw> I love how they added a line at the end in the update that spits in the player's face for noticing the massive hole in the game's themes and message
[2:36:18] <%Dakuu75> gay
[2:36:19] <James_Quivers> GOOD
[2:36:21] <Parapattern> AWwwwwww
[2:36:22] <%ThomasOfTroy> This makes no sense with Control or Destroy, it works with synthesis
[2:36:25] <%Deadpal> awww
[2:36:26] <%RealThiele> wife that qussy
[2:36:26] <tanarath> @patstaresat If the Quarians hadn't attacked, it would have been two geth dreadnaughts, a ton of geth fighters, plus the full Quarian fleet vs. the reapers. The Quarians almost fucked the galaxy
[2:36:27] <SteelSnake93101> aww
[2:36:27] <%logoth_> BOOOOO
[2:36:28] <%machshop> CUTE
[2:36:29] <%logoth_> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

[2:36:34] <%MidnightBurst12> "cute"
[2:36:36] <%Dakuu75> <3
[2:36:38] <%MisterRockett> You've turned Tali into Paige.
[2:36:38] <scrumbotime> Booooo marry Legion instead boooooooooooooooooo
[2:36:40] <DSD24> Lets bone on these rocks
[2:36:40] <@ssjklyco> It looks like the Grand Canyon
[2:36:41] <studleydoorite> if only his special eyes were active for that
[2:36:41] <kingra> WIFE <3
[2:36:45] <akitanito> oh well
[2:36:47] <%sporeian94> @ThomasOfTroy But Synthesis is stupid. It's literal magic that makes no sense
[2:36:48] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @commanderclaw i think them handwaving it away made me more mad than just ignoring it
[2:36:50] <%InternetShis> She lub yoooo
[2:36:50] <SaltyAzteca> Does it not work anymore?
[2:36:52] <%GabeSweetMan> Life Good.
[2:36:53] <%DrTomT18> I'M MOURNING HIM MORE
[2:36:53] <@QueequegTheater> "CUTE ONE? SO THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE!"
[2:36:54] <ghosrevan> you don't have a brand
[2:36:55] <scrumbotime> "How crazy is it that I'm not racist anymore!?"
[2:36:57] <Treasure_Vault> I can't believe they landed in Arizona
[2:36:57] <valriot> "I love you, mildly racist wife"
[2:36:58] <%Dakuu75> omfg, if he had special eyes right now. I might've legit die laughing
[2:36:59] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt If you pick the geth over the Quarians Tali kills herself here
[2:37:00] <Marpolo13> it kinda is for the extreme robo racism tho
[2:37:00] <Treasure_Vault> Is it?
[2:37:02] <James_Quivers> GRAND CANYON
[2:37:03] <%DrTomT18> "Not as beautiful as a dead reaper though."
[2:37:04] <Meltoras12> No offence Tali, but your planet kinda looks like s**t.
[2:37:04] <Treasure_Vault> Where is the green?
[2:37:04] <Minorou> Legion had more personality than Kaidan and Ashley combined
[2:37:05] <%LordMoonIV> It's just a barren rock!
[2:37:06] <%greasypete00> i think i feel some special eyes coming on
[2:37:06] <%Deft_Thought> Legion deserved better
[2:37:06] <Macfine> its just a pile of rocks..
[2:37:07] <peachy996> It's just Nevada
[2:37:07] <%machshop> grab a handful shepard
[2:37:08] <Virokwet> "i can believe how not racist im being"
[2:37:09] <Goraka91> This barren desert shithole planet sure is nice
[2:37:10] <%blue8moon> I think I've been there Kappa
[2:37:10] <secret_npc> Man this outcome sucks ass, should have nuked the Geth
[2:37:12] <olaksi> @commanderclaw "main character is sooo special nothing they did matters to the them" like what
[2:37:13] <cpt_langosta> COUGH IN HER FACE
[2:37:14] <%sporeian94> THEY SHOULD'VE SHOWN HER FACE HERE FOR FUCKS SAKE
[2:37:14] <Profmcstevie> Hey Tali....we're getting super indoctrinated right now huh
[2:37:15] <%cvp5127> f

[2:37:16] <Brandon__Brando> omg I forgot
[2:37:16] <%Conscript_Gary> She's been racist her whole life, it's gonna take some time to adjust
[2:37:16] <%greasypete00> YEYEYEYEYEYEYE
[2:37:17] <%LumberjackJack> It'd be dope if the face reveal was right here, but nooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:37:17] <%walternatorz> fuck these lazy assholes

[2:37:18] <SaltyAzteca> @QueequegTheater Are you serious?

[2:37:20] <%RealThiele> and this was AFTER theg eth cleaned it up
[2:37:20] <%logoth_> What do you think of it??
[2:37:21] <%LordMoonIV> OH NO, SHE'S SICK AGAIN
[2:37:21] <%Dakuu75> is that a good idea?
[2:37:21] <%GabeSweetMan> SMOOCH
[2:37:22] <%MidnightBurst12> booooooo
[2:37:23] <banananutcake> unnecessary infection
[2:37:23] <%kyh9> *dies*
[2:37:23] <%SABiscotti> Just wait til Tali starts making you watch movies with her, Pat
[2:37:24] <Laecerelius> BUT NO LOOK
[2:37:24] <%athuramn> you should check out how this pans out in the other endings
[2:37:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[2:37:24] <%RyTYoung> She sounds like a new character from Coronation Street LUL
[2:37:25] <%maskofmichael> Show Her Face!
[2:37:26] <mandorlalmond> Oh no she dead
[2:37:26] <@Ranryu692> it'd be funny if she just keeled over right there

[2:37:27] <%LumberjackJack> Bruh

[2:37:30] <olaksi> @commanderclaw *theme
[2:37:31] <%LordMoonIV> "Resolve"
[2:37:31] <%Varlinator> & then they boned
[2:37:31] <AngryAsian5> I feel like they could have just fixed part of the ending by making the refusal ending a viable way to win if you have enough war assets.
[2:37:31] <Sunstalker> AND THEN SHE DIED FROM THE INFECTION THE END
[2:37:31] <Laecerelius> NO LOOK AT TALI'S SMOOCHABLE FACE

[2:37:45] <%ThomasOfTroy> @sporeian94 Oh, I agree. But themetically, it's literally the only ending that makes sense with a peaceful resolution between the Geth and Quarians

[2:38:24] <%NocturneNovember> cheer500 Story time: Back in June, I got a package from Hungary. I didn't order anything from Hungary and my card didn't show anything, so I sent it back. It came back yesterday, and it turned out to be a Lady D titty mousepad a friend ordered months ago as a late birthday present.
[2:38:25] <cpt_langosta> THERE WAS NEW STUFF

[2:38:36] <ghosrevan> ask about quarrians
[2:38:36] <%captain_thickthighs> @jillyrancher that is the usual plan
[2:38:37] <SociallyAwkwardToaster> "hey ben" "hey" "see ya"
[2:38:38] <%afronooch> 1200 more and your golden
[2:38:39] <%LordMoonIV> BIG NUMBER
[2:38:39] <SaltyAzteca> Number went down my ass LUL
[2:38:41] <Brandon__Brando> if I remember there was a way to get both of them to stay alive but it's super complex
[2:38:42] <%SABiscotti> Master and Commander cheevo means you're Good
[2:38:42] <James_Quivers> I think he'll comment on the quarians and geth helping on the project
[2:38:46] <peachy996> YEYEYE Next mission is going to be fuuuuun
[2:38:46] <%GuilKato> ask him about geth
[2:38:47] <%GabeSweetMan> CDF! CDF! CDF!
[2:38:51] <titanor3> THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME MY GOD
[2:38:52] <%sporeian94> 1500 more needed
[2:38:53] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Don't forget to check the ALiiance 3rd fleet change
[2:38:53] <ErikFeral> That military strength better be at 6969 by the end of this game...
[2:38:57] <%LumberjackJack> Great so far
[2:38:59] <cpt_langosta> you won
[2:39:03] <akitanito> why do you still have that 5 point?
[2:39:06] <%DrTomT18> well you threw out 300 points when you killed the Baterians so
[2:39:08] <theegoone> i cant believe they didnt bring back the multiplayer for ME3
[2:39:10] <PaperyHornet1013> Yes he did pat Jesus at least pretend you care about the game
[2:39:11] <%RealThiele> 6969 required
[2:39:25] <%DrTomT18> no
[2:39:27] <%bread_assassin> I'm surprised toy still have Diana Allers after booting her from the ship.
[2:39:28] <Goraka91> Your one mistake was letting some survive
[2:39:28] <akitanito> worth it
[2:39:29] <%Bailey__gaming> bork
[2:39:30] <ThatGuyThere03> oh noooooooooooooooooooo
[2:39:30] <ErikFeral> screencap when it reaches 6969, do it
[2:39:31] <%walternatorz> 300 points well spent
[2:39:32] <%Dakuu75> lol
[2:39:33] <DXLelouch24> You won the game, you can literally beeline to the end now
[2:39:35] <%bread_assassin> *you
[2:39:38] <%InternetShis> Good
[2:39:38] <%SpcOpsBear> You need roughly 1300 military strength
[2:39:38] <%sporeian94> 7800 is needed minimum
[2:39:40] <Laecerelius> killing them is always worth it
[2:39:41] <SaltyAzteca> D:
[2:39:42] <%StormBuster24> psaDogchamp
[2:39:43] <BoneSkore> does the mitary strength ACTUALLY matter for the end?
[2:39:48] <%Monkeyweed21> you could have killed more batarians in the long run
[2:39:49] <%Deft_Thought> "I told them not to be racist." And then he was racist.
[2:39:50] <%Xevtes> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:39:50] <%jillyrancher> @patstaresat Fun fact Tali commits suicide and Admiral Raan shoots herself and Quarians go extinct you let the Geth upload the data rofl
[2:39:51] <%afronooch> yeah
[2:39:52] <%DrTomT18> maybe
[2:39:53] <%Dakuu75> is Gief making whining noises or was that Paige going "Pat-UH"
[2:39:54] <Sp3ctre48> yes
[2:39:54] <%PunchSlugfest> nope
[2:39:55] <%LumberjackJack> You'll easily get there, yeah
[2:39:57] <%Conscript_Gary> Easily
[2:39:57] <%ape_hawk> @BoneSkore for a certain ending, yes
[2:39:57] <%SABiscotti> With DLC? Absolutely
[2:39:57] <%kyh9> yes
[2:39:58] <SteelSnake93101> yes
[2:40:00] <%DrTomT18> Levithan is next
[2:40:01] <%InternetShis> Yeah
[2:40:01] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> yea
[2:40:02] <%tusk102> @BoneSkore yes it does immensely
[2:40:03] <mandorlalmond> You are already enough
[2:40:04] <%sporeian94> maybe, the batarians might be the make break
[2:40:05] <%TourettesPlays> @SpcOpsBear no we need to have a house party with all our friends first and play in the arcade
[2:40:05] <tanarath> yeah
[2:40:05] <%kyh9> With the Leviathan DLC and Citadel DLC, easily
[2:40:05] <peachy996> i dunno
[2:40:06] <Laecerelius> If not you can always take a piss and get some magically
[2:40:06] <%afronooch> leviathan and citdel give some
[2:40:08] <secret_npc> Pat will you do Citadel before or after the ending?
[2:40:11] <%MugenSandan> Honestly this kinda makes me appreciate how much effort it took to end the Dragonsong war in comparison
[2:40:12] <%Xevtes> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[2:40:13] <peachy996> we'll find out won't we
[2:40:15] <%PunchSlugfest> don't give him hope, let him think he can't
[2:40:17] <DXLelouch24> Easily
[2:40:18] <%afronooch> and you can scan for more if you feel you need it
[2:40:18] <%InternetShis> After next mission, Leviathan, and Citadel, yeah
[2:40:21] <%CasualSleepyGamer> You have two DLCs , you'll have enough
[2:40:22] <%GabeSweetMan> psaDogchamp BabyRage
[2:40:22] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As long as you do the Leviathan DLC
[2:40:28] <%AmericanSkidd> no it didnt, it was shooting at ME
[2:40:29] <%tusk102> @secret_npc you literally cant do it any other time lol
[2:40:32] <Ekaelis> That was just a Destroyer, Sovereign class Reapers are more than 10 times larger
[2:40:34] <%RoldanDgr8> Leviathan now?
[2:40:35] <%bread_assassin> You only need 7800 is you want to get the best ending varient of Destroy.
[2:40:40] <+Mr___Pillow> Thought they said only 3,600 was needed when the game released?
[2:40:41] <mandorlalmond> Legion is watching Shepard from heaven
[2:40:45] <intestinal_bleeding> baby dog noise
[2:40:45] <mikeriffic> it shot up once

[2:40:56] <%CasualSleepyGamer> Gief is sad over Legion
[2:40:58] <secret_npc> @tusk102 You can though?
[2:41:03] <%TourettesPlays> @QueequegTheater Leviathan is cool even tho I hate what it does to the lore
[2:41:03] <%Dakuu75> GIEF~! NO~! Stop being spicy!
[2:41:04] <@QueequegTheater> Legion and Mordin are dabbing on God in heaven now
[2:41:05] <%jillyrancher> Legion is on the memorial wall
[2:41:10] <%Bailey__gaming> is that Peggy Carter?
[2:41:14] <James_Quivers> NERD CREW PODCAST
[2:41:16] <%DrTomT18> ON, LIARA HAS A FUNNY EMAIL FOR YOU

[2:41:27] <%tusk102> @secret_npc you can't do dlc after the games already over unless you mean reloading the save
[2:41:27] <peachy996> Good Gief, shout over the videogame
[2:41:30] <%Dakuu75> awwww, gief-noises lol <3
[2:41:32] <@QueequegTheater> @TourettesPlays IMO it actually saves it, because it introduces the idea that the Reapers are flawed
[2:41:33] <%rekinom> why dog cry
[2:41:45] <+SinisterBroccoli> that sounds like a human baby
[2:41:48] <%Xevtes> psaDogchamp psaGiefrail

[2:41:59] <%LordMoonIV> opposite way around
[2:42:03] <%AmericanSkidd> i never would have thought that
[2:42:03] <%Bailey__gaming> Sad Doggo
[2:42:08] <Latija> but they didn't turn on the quarians
[2:42:12] <%Wallabri> why he baby
[2:42:12] <James_Quivers> Individualist AI are indeed WAAAY better to hang with than hivemind AI

[2:44:39] <%AmericanSkidd> lovers?
[2:44:41] <%bahookery> Liara has a sick gaming rig
[2:44:47] <%Dakuu75> @Dunmarkh ^
[2:44:49] <Ekaelis> What was the quarian word for servant again? LUL
[2:44:50] <%kyh9> I fucking hate how the Geth story ends
[2:44:55] <@commanderclaw> "Maybe one day we can forgive our slaves we invented for killing us when we tried to genocide them"
[2:44:55] <alrobot2014> how many monitors does this woman neeed
[2:44:58] <%DrTomT18> Geth are friends
[2:45:00] <ammobasket> Neighbors. They’re neighbors now
[2:45:10] <Treasure_Vault> Legion's raid buddies are gonna worry about him
[2:45:15] <%MightyDuckShoes> Tali- "Just don't make me have to touch one of them..."
[2:45:21] <%AmericanSkidd> They were roommates
[2:45:22] <secret_npc> Realistically, if a human being actually spoke to a true AI, they would go insane in minutes
[2:45:26] <%captain_thickthighs> the vr porn will be legendary

[2:45:28] <%hat_under_bread> He'll be a saint either way.
[2:45:30] <@QueequegTheater> <3
[2:45:30] <peachy996> Oh boyy
[2:45:30] <%jillyrancher> If you side with the Quarians Pat you have to watch Tali stab Legion in the back and watch her gun him down while he stares at her with his sad flashlight eye @patstaresat
[2:45:30] <%Dakuu75> "Saint Shepard" lol
[2:45:31] <Virokwet> more like krogan and salarians
[2:45:32] <James_Quivers> Talk-no-Jutsu the Repaers
[2:45:36] <%jillyrancher> its fuuuuuuucked
[2:45:36] <%GabeSweetMan> Do the geth have a vibration module? I'm sure there's a few quarians who joined the sympathizer faction as a result.
[2:45:38] <AngryAsian5> Blue Ending LUL
[2:45:40] <santafer> he also has a batarian friend
[2:45:40] <%Deft_Thought> Why does he know what a Saint is
[2:45:41] <%kyh9> The way the geth story ends is dumb and makes no sense.  Are all geth a single consciousness?  Is it based on which platforms the geth were on when Legion did his thing?  Is each and every program sentient?
[2:45:44] <cpt_langosta> was that foreshadowing or lampshading the dumb ending?
[2:45:46] <peachy996> I'm sure that line will happen, Garrus buddy
[2:45:47] <%Dakuu75> "Saint Shepard" and his symbol is just, a gun
[2:45:51] <%dekkitout> What day would St. Shepard's day be on
[2:46:00] <%tusk102> @GabeSweetMan i mean they have built in suit vibes so why not geths Kappa
[2:46:02] <dd44dostivei> humans would never be able to share a planet with another int species, and quarians are even bigger dicks than humans

[2:46:09] <%PunchSlugfest> How about just The Shepard
[2:46:11] <$Futurecity10> playing pathfinder and for some reason all the he/hims are all hers which is weird
[2:46:20] <scrumbotime> Playing two person poker is lame
[2:46:23] <%MightyDuckShoes> Think Shala'Raan noticed how masculine that Geth Prime was?
[2:46:24] <olaksi> are they playing strip poker
[2:46:26] <%sporeian94> IT'S JUST LIKE STAR TREK!

[2:46:49] <AngryAsian5> Time for strip poker Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:46:51] <secret_npc> It doesn't matter how nice the Geth are, uploading Reaper code invalidates everything they try to do
[2:46:51] <%JamesCorck> They have more dialogue lol
[2:46:53] <teebos> hey i live there!

[2:58:26] <%JoshManVGH> Mito...thessia?
[2:58:27] <%kyh9> Yes
[2:58:29] <%Dakuu75> imagine in a few years ppl will say "I been watching pat since TBF" and "I been watching Pat since, before he got married" then "I watched Pat before he put his brain in a robot toilet."
[2:58:29] <%maskofmichael> Don't forget to go to your room for that qussy
[2:58:31] <@Ranryu692> that is the right choice
[2:58:33] <%Conscript_Gary> It's right
[2:58:33] <Minorou> Liara and Javik are a MUST for Thessia
[2:58:33] <lloyddboy> LUL
[2:58:34] <James_Quivers> It's a HUGE DIFFERENCE

[2:58:39] <Astrophizz> yep
[2:58:41] <@commanderclaw> YES IT DOES
[2:58:43] <Javier9563> diplomacy totally wins wars tho
[2:58:44] <%ThomasOfTroy> That's 100% correct
[2:58:45] <cpt_langosta> javik, go get bullied
[2:58:47] <%DrTomT18> shut the fuck up Javik
[2:58:48] <%DrTomT18> fucking idiot
[2:58:51] <mikeriffic> Diplomacy JUST ended a war
[2:58:51] <%kyh9> "Geth are stupid, Quarians are also INCREDIBLY stupid"
[2:58:53] <secret_npc> Nah bring James and Kaiden
[2:58:53] <%dekkitout> Javik, must everything be a nail to you?
[2:58:53] <$hattrick61> based javik

[2:58:56] <%stantheman_97> that's not true, javik
[2:58:56] <scrumbotime> "See, I'm right, because we've always won our wars and never lost so bad that my species doesn't exist"
[2:58:58] <@ssjklyco> Javik is that moody teen in high school
[2:59:00] <%LumberjackJack> OH THIS PART SUCKS
[2:59:02] <%RealThiele> just genocide them L O L

[2:59:07] <Treasure_Vault> Any war you don't have to fight is a war won. Thanks, diplomacy
[2:59:07] <olm46> "You guys are dumb. My dead race did it better."
[2:59:07] <%InternetShis> Literally just did, loser

[2:59:10] <Silent_Fyraena> squeek
[2:59:12] <@commanderclaw> It didn't win *you* any wars cause you genocided or enslaved all potential allies!
[2:59:12] <blackjack8182> Diplomacy does win wars
[2:59:12] <mandorlalmond> The only way to win the Reapers is with the power of friendship
[2:59:17] <$hattrick61> nothing won wars in his cycle
[2:59:18] <%JoshManVGH> But not as hard as he owned james that one time
[2:59:18] <Brandon__Brando> I mean a nuke is a good talking point
[2:59:23] <%InternetShis> le fishe

[2:59:29] <%demiiluna> Did the Protheans ever try diplomacy with ANYTHING?
[2:59:29] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt In Javik's defense the only war he fought was against the Reapers
[2:59:30] <%KaiserMario> Yes Pat, the video-game alien just got owned by you talking to your 4k tv
[2:59:33] <%charp35> I cant believe the photo used to be a photoshopped stock photo
[2:59:34] <%decent_gaming> Javik's not an idiot. he's an a-hole
[2:59:35] <%dekkitout> Look at that photograph
[2:59:36] <Sp3ctre48> It's slightly less embarrassing!
[2:59:37] <%DrTomT18> Pat have you ever seen the original?

[3:04:40] <%DrTomT18> Pat just missed something
[3:04:43] <James_Quivers> Binding of Isaac reference POG
[3:04:43] <@commanderclaw> It's pronounced Heck-aht-eyy
[3:04:45] <olaksi> remember how hong kong was super important then we all kinda lost interest when more exciting news happened
[3:04:45] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Seoul
[3:04:48] <%InternetShis> @PatStaresAt While we're looking for fuel... I'm working on my thesis on game dev crunch, any pointers?
[3:04:49] <chainsaw105> wait Sheol?! Dammit I took the Polaroid!
[3:04:51] <Laecerelius> This system is adorable
[3:04:55] <%blue8moon> perfect for pat then
[3:04:56] <%NocturneNovember> it's the Pat system!
[3:04:57] <%HotSauceFiend> that is not a sphere
[3:04:58] <%unhuggable1> @DrTomT18 he didnt miss it he cant get it yet
[3:05:01] <Minorou> orb
[3:05:03] <%InternetShis> ORB GET
[3:05:08] <%texaporte> wait, have we been through leviathan and omega?
[3:05:08] <%kyh9> SPHEREICAL
[3:05:09] <@ssjklyco> Crunch bad
[3:05:10] <%BinaryFireball> crunch bad
[3:05:10] <mikeriffic> Crunch bad
[3:05:11] <peachy996> dont do it
[3:05:12] <TioXyco> you got a protean testicle, good job
[3:05:13] <jorniev> TALK TO DEVS
[3:05:13] <blackjack8182> Baby system for baby Mode
[3:05:14] <+Cityscape17> this probing reminds me of the time Janeway killed a planet
[3:05:14] <%MidnightBurst12> crunch bad
[3:05:14] <%maskofmichael> it's bad
[3:05:14] <cpt_langosta> 2 word thesis: it sucks
[3:05:15] <Treasure_Vault> It has never been worth it once?
[3:05:15] <peachy996> There's a pointer
[3:05:16] <%sonofthedeepsouth> It fucking sucks
[3:05:18] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt South of star
[3:05:19] <%BinaryFireball> management important
[3:05:20] <@commanderclaw> Self imposed bad health decisions are still bad decisions
[3:05:21] <%kyh9> Crunch Bad!  Raycon Good!
[3:05:22] <Sloavon> Have you checked the Bownzahn system?
[3:05:22] <%afronooch> Dranek becomes inaccessible after the second citadel story mission
[3:05:23] <%BinaryFireball> investors evil
[3:05:23] <Profmcstevie> developers can be as bad as management
[3:05:23] <@commanderclaw> That's my take
[3:05:29] <%InternetShis> good idea
[3:05:29] <%DrTomT18> @DrTomT18 You might be right? I thought that was the mission Barla Von gave you
[3:05:30] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Crunch bad
[3:05:30] <%unhuggable1> @texaporte omega yes, leviathan no
[3:05:31] <lloyddboy> NO DO IT YOU'LL GET A BETTER GRADE
[3:05:32] <Silent_Fyraena> God scanning in this game is so dumb
[3:05:33] <%RealThiele> Yo dawg
[3:05:51] <Treasure_Vault> If one guy works a weekend, all the other departments now have to work a weekend to implement it
[3:05:52] <%HotSauceFiend> If its a self imposed bad health decision, you just take liability away from the manager/developer
[3:05:55] <tanarath> crunch is literally a waste of time as it causes more problems than it solves
[3:05:56] <+Mr___Pillow> Is it Game Over if the Reapers get you if you fail to evade?
[3:06:04] <%kyh9> @lloyddboy MEtacritic below 85?  Sorry guys, your first borns get axed
[3:06:08] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Ooh run from the Reapers ooh
[3:06:11] <Profmcstevie> Crunch bad, Management is often poor, developers are dangerous to themselves in an industry of passion with a habit of self harm
[3:06:18] <%RealThiele> ugh fuck that guy
[3:06:23] <alrobot2014> you retweeted that the other day didn't you?
[3:06:24] <%sonofthedeepsouth> BASED PEER PRESUSURE
[3:06:24] <%BinaryFireball> this is a true
[3:06:26] <%texaporte> @texaporte aight, so some asset grind is required, fair nuff
[3:06:35] <Profmcstevie> One guy effects THE WHOLE DEV TEAM
[3:06:36] <%InternetShis> I ACTUALLY BROUGHT THAT UP, but yeah it's a snowball effect
[3:06:39] <%BinaryFireball> "feature creep" guy is a fucking asshole
[3:06:44] <Astrophizz> yeah I have to push junior devs on my team not to work late
[3:06:45] <peachy996> So one guy putting more into their work ruins it for everyone else
[3:06:53] <%Agami23> one good worker will get the whole team abused
[3:06:53] <%JoshManVGH> ... that's just true for Game Design right...?
[3:06:58] <%DrTomT18> yup
[3:06:59] <James_Quivers> Yep
[3:06:59] <peachy996> Cool!

[3:07:14] <Laecerelius> Pat loves this system!
[3:07:15] <%sonofthedeepsouth> Silksong is a collective fever dream chat
[3:07:21] <peachy996> And don't put more than what's required into it
[3:07:27] <%sonofthedeepsouth> We are all crazy
[3:07:28] <%RealThiele> enjoy your job but recognize moderation
[3:07:29] <+condemned_15> you need a sticky note on the tv
[3:07:31] <%HotSauceFiend> I thoguht Pats favroite system was the Batarian one he blew up?
[3:07:38] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Between Hades and the rachni system but ignore me thats for DLC
[3:07:50] <%JoshManVGH> @sonofthedeepsouth I'll belive that.
[3:07:50] <peachy996> I'm sure moderation was recognized
[3:07:53] <%hat_under_bread> Or let the workaholic prototype a bunch of cool stuff and only take the best.

[3:09:20] <+ALazo> they are too big
[3:09:24] <%kyh9> yes, but higher top speed
[3:09:26] <Laecerelius> But they do have a great top speed
[3:09:27] <Meekest> Yo this scanning shit sucks
[3:09:29] <Profmcstevie> Reapers built like a Hummer
[3:09:30] <%DrTomT18> @LumberjackJack That's not true, Fire Walker exists
[3:09:30] <Kat_k> i'l pretty sure if you remember where *stuff* was in me1 that's where the scan spots are in the me1 systems

[3:09:48] <BurdRightsActivist> TOPLEFT
[3:10:03] <%LumberjackJack> @DrTomT18 True, though at least Fire Walker seems sorta maybe possibly fun the first time
[3:10:06] <%HotSauceFiend> Space dinosaurs
[3:10:06] <%kyh9> KROGAN
[3:10:07] <%blue8moon> wow, not fuel

[3:10:09] <%kyh9> MOUNTS
[3:10:11] <T_Sasquatch> That sound is so fucking annoying in my headphones
[3:10:11] <%InternetShis> DINO MOUNTS
[3:10:12] <cpt_langosta> make a big dumb sword out of it
[3:10:13] <Minorou> the reapers are warships, the normandy is built for agility and being sneaky
[3:10:15] <Silent_Fyraena> Ping... ping... ping... FAAAAART!
[3:10:16] <TioXyco> a Kek-o-saur?

[3:10:17] <BurdRightsActivist> MOUNTS
[3:10:19] <%InternetShis> Oh my god I just realized they fucked up the FMV upscale for the relay jump. The black at the bottom of the screen blurs upwards and makes a big black blur
[3:10:20] <James_Quivers> OH MAN THAT'S FOR A GREAT SIDEQUEST
[3:10:22] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Gorgon doesnt have fuel so yeah get more fuel
[3:10:23] <%ThomasOfTroy> That's the citadel side quest thing, right?
[3:10:27] <Profmcstevie> We're gonna RESURRECT those dinosaurs and send them to the Reaper worlds
[3:10:35] <%TourettesPlays> Of course shepard sent James out to grab the dinosaur fossil
[3:10:40] <%DrTomT18> uhh

[3:10:52] <@Ranryu692> krogan DMZ has fuel
[3:10:53] <%DrTomT18> Citadel does not have fuel
[3:10:54] <peachy996> Check the Krogan DMZ oh wait
[3:10:55] <Javier9563> not reaper controlled systems

[3:11:23] <Meekest> Not even a little
[3:11:23] <%cvp5127> LUL
[3:11:24] <peachy996> Nope!
[3:11:24] <%DrTomT18> okay Pat, another system will appear here LATER, I was half right. I apologize

[3:11:27] <James_Quivers> With the DLC, hell nah
[3:11:27] <%tusk102> no
[3:11:29] <@Ranryu692> not at the pace you've been going
[3:11:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> not really, but that's fine
[3:11:29] <%afronooch> not unless you no life it
[3:11:30] <DSD24> Ehh the DLC is gonna get you on that
[3:11:30] <%DracosMagala> NAH
[3:11:31] <Profmcstevie> Not at this pace
[3:11:31] <Drunkengen> N O
[3:11:35] <James_Quivers> Citadel is BIG
[3:11:35] <%kyh9> YOU STILL HAVE CITADEL
[3:11:36] <digaogrunge> no
[3:11:36] <%JamesCorck> Pat you have at least 4-5 more streams.
[3:11:37] <T_Sasquatch> Pat is gonna love lost judgement Kappa
[3:11:40] <%InternetShis> Not after the last two stream delays
[3:11:42] <%kyh9> CITADEL DLC IS LIKE A THIRD OF THE GAMES RUN TIME
[3:11:45] <%JamesCorck> You have to focus on this game a lot if you want to.
[3:11:45] <tanarath> 3-4 more streams, maybe? big ones?
[3:11:47] <%topendbuzza> no but you might beat the outer wilds dlc
[3:11:52] <forumbug74> if you pick it up maybe
[3:11:54] <%Chichen> Mass Judgement
[3:11:55] <+xcompleasedad> If you played it for five hours a day for every day before Judgement......
[3:11:56] <%InternetShis> No
[3:11:56] <@Ranryu692> no more heroes in there as well
[3:11:57] <%DrTomT18> the Citadel DLC is very long yes
[3:11:58] <JokerNewby> no more heroes off the list?
[3:11:59] <Profmcstevie> Nice beat to it
[3:12:01] <%afronooch> citadel is long
[3:12:01] <DSD24> Isn't that gonna make ME3 longer
[3:12:02] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Not if you 100%
[3:12:03] <jorniev> MAYBE some delta rune
[3:12:08] <blackjack8182> Bring back Tales of Arise!!!!!!!
[3:12:09] <JokerNewby> makes sense
[3:12:09] <Silent_Fyraena> What even happens when you run out of fuel?
[3:12:13] <%Monkeyweed21> NMH 3 is like 2 more streams
[3:12:18] <@ssjklyco> So there will be NO MORE heroes for now
[3:12:22] <%cvp5127> maybe finish nmh in one go?
[3:12:23] <Profmcstevie> When the mass is done, travis strikes again again
[3:12:23] <%AmericanSkidd> you are past the halfway point for sure
[3:12:24] <StaceMcGate> was Tales bad?
[3:12:28] <28moogles> I thought FFXIV thing tomorrow?
[3:12:28] <$LulzorGG> Is this a passable videogame
[3:12:32] <%BinaryFireball> is it true that Arise has horrible DLC ads?
[3:12:37] <ghosrevan> pat it's been five years you still owe me ten dollars
[3:12:37] <Dunmarkh> Bring back tales of symphonia
[3:12:37] <TioXyco> tales of arise has fallen and can't get up
[3:12:41] <%Monkeyweed21> bring back Great Ace Attorney

[3:12:44] <+condemned_15> LUL
[3:12:45] <%GuilKato> you can probably mod the me3le ini file to set your fuel burn to 0 - I did that back in original me3
[3:12:48] <%Treuan> Oh damn yeah Judgement is soon
[3:12:49] <%The_Protagonist> also how long this fuckin game is haha
[3:12:50] <%RealThiele> no, money down!

[3:13:08] <%NeoCre> Do a Mass Effect Death March to Completion
[3:13:18] <+JustToWatch> Gene said you can fight children
[3:13:19] <@ssjklyco> Tale of Arise is $50, not judgement
[3:13:22] <blackjack8182> 😢
[3:13:29] <%RoldanDgr8> rather watch Arise then Judgement again
[3:13:31] <Sp3ctre48> I've always been pretty negative with Tales but Arise has been a blast so far
[3:13:33] <@commanderclaw> We just talked about how Crunch is bad Pat!
[3:13:36] <%InternetShis> Mayhaps

[3:14:08] <%TourettesPlays> damn pat you crunch all the time
[3:14:10] <@ssjklyco> Half, since you play games off camera anyways.
[3:14:11] <+JustToWatch> so a normal stream then?
[3:14:13] <%hat_under_bread> Do a Snoop Dogg stream.
[3:14:13] <ErikFeral> just save, beat the game and reload /grind on another stream
[3:14:15] <KnivesEve> Where is the hero of time KAI LENG?
[3:14:15] <%king_wragles> ya
[3:14:15] <@commanderclaw> So a normal stream then?
[3:14:17] <Dunmarkh> That's every stream Pat
[3:14:18] <+RoByte2> What's the difference?
[3:14:18] <28moogles> Isn't that normal?
[3:14:19] <%king_wragles> that'd be a crunch
[3:14:19] <%InternetShis> Improved
[3:14:19] <olaksi> can't tell the difference
[3:14:20] <+Qexec> What's the difference?
[3:14:21] <T_Sasquatch> You can't crunch while working for yourself
[3:14:21] <Profmcstevie> Yes? Isn't that exactly the point of crunch bad, you stop focusing
[3:14:21] <%Dakuu75> damn-son

[3:14:50] <%CodyStruggles> Counter crunch
[3:14:50] <%maskofmichael> Crunch would be you beating the game without doing any side missions
[3:14:50] <%Monkeyweed21> performance anxiety
[3:14:51] <Zeif00> sweat whored
[3:14:52] <mr_saturday93> Streaming is a tough workout
[3:14:52] <%RealThiele> braining uses lots of energy
[3:14:53] <%saadi90> Peeing constantly
[3:14:53] <BurdRightsActivist> HOARD
[3:14:56] <@ssjklyco> You should weigh your self before and after a stream to see how much you sweated
[3:14:56] <ghosrevan> you should see a doctor

[3:15:13] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt This is the Elcor homeworld
[3:15:16] <%MidnightBurst12> testicle anxiety is serious shit
[3:15:17] <jorniev> i agree
[3:15:18] <%SpcOpsBear> @PatStaresAt I think it's because you're a big person because I'm fat and that shit happens to me too
[3:15:18] <%Monkeyweed21> Pats back and pits are pissing themselves
[3:15:19] <James_Quivers> DEKKUNA, that's Elcor homeworld

[3:15:31] <%NeoCre> So you’re saying you are, in fact, a sweaty gamer?
[3:15:32] <%shurtal> The horror of being aware that others are aware of you
[3:15:32] <%afronooch> i wonder what the sweatiest chat is
[3:15:35] <Kat_k> oh crap it's the elcor world
[3:15:37] <%DrTomT18> Pat you need to talk to an Elcor on the Citadel

[3:16:35] <mandorlalmond> sigma move
[3:16:36] <@commanderclaw> I do the same thing with PvP games honestly, I just stop being interested eventually
[3:16:36] <Profmcstevie> It demands your attention, bleugh

[3:16:49] <%RyTYoung> What about Destiny 2? Will you go back to that at some point? @patstaresat
[3:16:52] <%JoshManVGH> !sellout
[3:16:52] <@Moobot> @JoshManVGH "If you *ever* have the opportunity to sell out you sell out as hard as you can it will be the best thing that ever happened to your fucking life! No one ever regretted selling out, except for 'artists' who care about their 'integrity' 'n shit." ~Pat 2016
[3:16:55] <chancho4tierra> You scream like a bitch when peach drop something so, i dont dare to call you calm hahaha

[3:17:28] <QuestlordJake> I don't understand sunsetting
[3:17:30] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt Would you play a hypothetical Destiny 3?
[3:17:31] <blackjack8182> What character could they add to bring you back to Fortnite?!
[3:17:34] <+xerotwo> Sounds like they're not fixing it LUL
[3:17:36] <%dekkitout> Felwinters is literally a best in slot candidate and is easy to get
[3:17:37] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt There's nothing here yet
[3:17:38] <+Kyma1020> That's fair
[3:17:40] <cpt_langosta> people who still defend destiny are baffling to me
[3:17:40] <Profmcstevie> It was NEVER about the minmax
[3:17:47] <Goraka91> Hey this game your bought? We're gonna make parts of it just NOT EXIST because shut up though
[3:17:48] <Profmcstevie> It's my FAVOURITE GUN and they FUCKED IT
[3:17:51] <$Futurecity10> Fuck my ass
[3:17:57] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt As someone who played Destiny 1 and 2 since Vanilla's launch, Taken King was the peak and it's been downhill ever since.
[3:17:57] <DXLelouch24> @patstaresat Pat im playing Tales of Arise right now while watching you and holy fuck the sexual tension in this game
[3:18:01] <%DrTomT18> this is a glitch!

[3:18:04] <peachy996> HA!
[3:18:05] <%DrTomT18> ignore it
[3:18:08] <Silent_Fyraena> @QuestlordJake When the only thing your game has going on is grinding for gear, it's scary for the devs when they *think* a lot of people have all the gear.
[3:18:08] <peachy996> Double Wrong

[3:18:37] <blackjack8182> A glitch! Bioware fixed nothing
[3:18:38] <%Conscript_Gary> yeah the reaper system thing doesn't actually matter, it's bullshit
[3:18:38] <tanarath> SPOILERS
[3:18:39] <%Monkeyweed21> why should you give the benefit of the doubt to a game that has repeatedly fucked up horribly
[3:18:40] <+D00msDayDan> BWUUUUM
[3:18:40] <cpt_langosta> the reapers can cheat if they want, they're evil
[3:18:41] <Profmcstevie> oooh this shut bugged

[3:18:44] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Fun Fact: the planet name "Caleston" was one of the first planet names mentioned in one of the original ME1 teaser trailers.

[3:19:04] <%dekkitout> @General_Terro A third of your old cuts wouldn't make the cut now, and the other two thirds are probably back and wack
[3:19:17] <%InternetShis> yes
[3:19:24] <+Mr___Pillow> What are your thoughts on Monster Rise compared to Generations Ultimate if you played it? Will you stream Rise again when it comes to PC next year?
[3:19:31] <Goraka91> >:(
[3:19:33] <Silent_Fyraena> """Ground""" transport
[3:19:34] <BigFingerRo> Wow, Pat, you're so sweaty, people complain about you on scrubquotes!
[3:19:34] <%CodyStruggles> They'd have to do what Halo Infinite is doing with their battlepasses for me to go back. That it took this long for someone to go buy the battlepass whenever is really telling of just how FOMO oriented all those games are.
[3:19:35] <mr_saturday93> 😡 ELCOR
[3:19:37] <PaperyHornet1013> It’s telling you to play the dlc
[3:19:37] <StaceMcGate> Malding Elcor
[3:19:38] <%InternetShis> ANGY
[3:19:40] <ghosrevan> badasally "make my day"
[3:19:42] <+D00msDayDan> angrily: this is bullshit, human
[3:19:43] <+condemned_15> I'M MAD
[3:19:43] <Profmcstevie> Frustrated, I am furious
[3:19:46] <%RealThiele> BADDASSLEY
[3:19:53] <cpt_langosta> "Angry Elcor" sounds like a cringy twitch streamer
[3:19:55] <+D00msDayDan> badassfully
[3:20:02] <James_Quivers> Talk to purple wife
[3:20:02] <%Monkeyweed21> Destiny 2 has the WoW problem of "why should I come back for this good expansion when the next one has a 50/50 chance of being trash"
[3:20:07] <KeiPrime> Angriest Elcor?
[3:20:20] <Profmcstevie> I hope to meet a verbose elcor one day
[3:20:21] <chainsaw105> because the game is fun to play
[3:20:30] <+MrJackett> Angrily: I am not angry.
[3:20:34] <tattleworm> feel like it's closer to 25/75 for d2
[3:20:35] <+trashmanasam> 70/30 for WoW
[3:20:37] <Goraka91> Don't forget you lose all your progress every season because fuck you
[3:20:40] <ghosrevan> i want a sexy elcor one day
[3:20:41] <James_Quivers> I enjoyed the Legion expansion in WoW as a standalone
[3:20:42] <%RealThiele> yea good expansions like BFA and shadowlands LUL
[3:20:43] <%Treuan> Gave you a new lyse on life
[3:20:45] <$Falilth> but the last 3 or 4 wow expansions have been bad
[3:20:45] <$Futurecity10> Stormblood almost kill FF14 for me
[3:20:45] <%DrTomT18> that gives you a huge war score boost!
[3:20:48] <+D00msDayDan> destiny's been on a hot streak this year maybe they won't bungle it for once
[3:20:48] <StaceMcGate> Pat loves Lyse now
[3:20:49] <%cobalt_phoenix_> wait do people say stormblood is bad? why?
[3:20:51] <Profmcstevie> The worst expansion of FF14 is a daring 7/10
[3:20:55] <+condemned_15> Jurassic Park?
[3:20:56] <%DoubleRrico> we're sending dinosaurs into space war!
[3:20:56] <ammobasket> stormblood is still cool
[3:20:58] <%Monkeyweed21> KROGAN DINO MOUNTS
[3:20:58] <@Ranryu692> I resubbed last week and it's already taken over my life
[3:20:58] <Dunmarkh> Ah yes the krogan dinosaur cavalry
[3:20:58] <%DrTomT18> talk to him again!
[3:20:58] <+ItalianWaifu> wait Stormblood is considered bad! I just beat it, its amazing
[3:21:00] <%tusk102> Stormblood is bad comparitively rather than "actually bad" @PatStaresAt
[3:21:01] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Also Destiny's second expansion (Taken King) was the peak just like Wrath of the Lich King
[3:21:03] <mr_saturday93> Beyond light wasn't bad
[3:21:04] <mandorlalmond> wow is getting shittier i hate to admit sometimes I'm glad i never played
[3:21:05] <%blue8moon> the worst part of FF14 is still a solid 7/10 at least
[3:21:05] <cpt_langosta> talk to him again for some dumb time jump bullshit
[3:21:06] <%Conscript_Gary> I love how he's shocked you actually took him seriously
[3:21:07] <Silent_Fyraena> CLONE DINOSAUR FOR THE WAR EFFORT!
[3:21:08] <%Dakuu75> SPACE Jurrasic Park
[3:21:09] <28moogles> Stormblood is a solid 7/10, it's just jarring because it's sandwiched between 10/10s
[3:21:11] <Rao2357> I just finished Stormblood and it's super hype
[3:21:12] <%Treuan> Yeah exactly half of stormblood
[3:21:15] <$Futurecity10> ARR > SB
[3:21:15] <%RealThiele> its ok Omega i love Larboard
[3:21:16] <%stantheman_97> now the krogan have alien dinosaur mounts
[3:21:16] <Latija> stormblood rules
[3:21:16] <Goraka91> Stormblood has the best fights in the whole game
[3:21:18] <%Mekhet09> Fuck ala mhigo.
[3:21:20] <%walternatorz> stormblood has some of the best raids
[3:21:23] <%afronooch> Destiny always has good big expac followed immediately by a bad one.
[3:21:25] <KeiPrime> i guess in hindsight stormblood is the least one?? but its still goood
[3:21:25] <James_Quivers> Missed Tali
[3:21:26] <Brandon__Brando> I want to get into it but I hate the beginning
[3:21:26] <%saadi90> Storm blood has cool dungeons and trials
[3:21:29] <RushUnplugged> @cobalt_phoenix_ it's "bad" because it's weaker than the others, but it's still really good. It just feels like a "filler episode" at times
[3:21:32] <%Chichen> yep
[3:21:34] <ghosrevan> why
[3:21:37] <PaperyHornet1013> Krogan tides trex
[3:21:42] <Goraka91> It's not as good as the expansions, that doesn't mean bad, people can't make the distinction
[3:21:48] <%Monkeyweed21> @mr_saturday93 yea but Shadowkeep was really dissapointing
[3:21:49] <%demiiluna> I KNOW RIGHT
[3:21:54] <IntrepidEye> I just don't have the will to go back and go through the Destiny grind again. Same with Warframe and new content islands and standing grinds
[3:21:56] <PaperyHornet1013> Talk to tali
[3:22:00] <+kettleroot> now that they cut out most of the tediumits pretty good
[3:22:01] <mr_saturday93> I wonder which expansions are considered bad after foreshaken
[3:22:05] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They fucking foreshadow the whole Hydaelyn thing IN THE FIRST IFRIT FIGHT
[3:22:07] <olaksi> the best is when some streamer is genuinely enjoying ARR and their chat tries to convince them they aren't
[3:22:08] <PaperyHornet1013> TALI
[3:22:09] <T_Sasquatch> ARR sucks ass tho ,it made me almost quit ffxiv . I don't mean in comparison . I started last year
[3:22:12] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @RushUnplugged oh yea that makes sense i guess, it's no heavensward or shb (still on shb), but i liked sb
[3:22:12] <%The_Protagonist> ARR is great and they took the unnecessary shit out of it anyway
[3:22:13] <Profmcstevie> If it WASN'T better now than it was 8 years ago, I'd be livid
[3:22:14] <28moogles> I played it in 2013 and it rocked my world
[3:22:17] <Goraka91> Just skip it, buy a boost to Shadowbringers LUL
[3:22:18] <%dekkitout> So was arr good or bad?
[3:22:19] <PaperyHornet1013> Tali
[3:22:20] <%JoshManVGH> And it keeps getting good-er-rer
[3:22:22] <%RigmaroleHM> I'm enjoying it as a sprout
[3:22:22] <mr_saturday93> Ppl just like to bitch
[3:22:24] <%Mekhet09> I still hate 2.X like you wouldn't believe. Like you could have cut more then half of it and not lost anything.
[3:22:27] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt find tali for a good convo
[3:22:28] <%SaiyanShoto> But then some people didn't like a realm reborn when it was out
[3:22:29] <%Axellogic> Max still talks about how glad he is he skipped it
[3:22:29] <tanarath> It's ok
[3:22:31] <thewhiterice92> Its like saying the first 50 chapters of One Piece aren't as good as everything else. Like DUH it got way better because of it
[3:22:35] <Rao2357> Is good
[3:22:39] <%Agami23> i remember seeing the meteor trailer for ff14 ARR, and getting really hyped seeing it. then when it said "final fantasy 14" at the end i wrote it off as trash because 14
[3:22:39] <%demiiluna> How do you feel about Max skipping ARR and being told it's the correct decision
[3:22:40] <%Conscript_Gary> That generic blonde human npc head looks uncannily like my first girlfriend and it trips me up every time
[3:22:40] <valiard> titan was rough
[3:22:41] <Goraka91> It's very good for a base MMO
[3:22:41] <%Treuan> Probably just the post ARR stuff coloring their view
[3:22:43] <Vermillion129> I think stormblood is just a little bit less good compare to Heavensward and Shadowbringer but the primal and omega raid fights in stormblood are way more fun and Heavensward so it's ok
[3:22:44] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt as a new player they did help cut the tedium by removing a buncha quests
[3:22:45] <@commanderclaw> ARR is like a good but not great JRPG
[3:22:46] <%dekkitout> A good drag, got it
[3:22:46] <mr_saturday93> it's thr same problem with D2 and WoW
[3:22:47] <notsoy> otoh you have current wow not being better than BC/LK lmao
[3:22:48] <Brandon__Brando> I had a friend that said that and I think thats what happened to me I dropped it
[3:22:49] <%Estuko> I got into it with a FC member who convinced people to buy a skip  and the poor guys had no idea what to do for most of the raids and dungeons and what was going on with story
[3:22:52] <%JoshManVGH> The only bad shit for ARR is the patch stuff
[3:22:54] <%afronooch> i liked ARR more than Heavensward, and I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority there
[3:22:55] <StaceMcGate> Alot of filler quests, so/so story, and so many baby dungeons
[3:22:56] <%blue8moon> if ARR was genuinely bad, there wouldn't be expansions
[3:22:57] <+idyota> Should I start now or wait for Australian servers?
[3:22:59] <%RealThiele> BLABHBLAHBLAH BLAHBLAHBLAH   T I T A N
[3:23:01] <%maskofmichael> Is 'good for its time' a thing you can say?
[3:23:03] <@Ranryu692> I'm glad I did the patch cycle stuff before they made them shorter
[3:23:04] <TioXyco> all I say about ARR is that it starts slow because it's literally a world building expansion.... or rebuilding, in this case
[3:23:05] <Latija> the 2.5 patch is godlike
[3:23:05] <%Monkeyweed21> It has to establish the world so its kinda slow and exposition heavy
[3:23:09] <28moogles> It's a lot of build up. It's overshadowed by better stuff later. But at the time it was a HUGE improvement over 1.x
[3:23:14] <%cobalt_phoenix_> imo the first half was slow and i was lost, then once i did the titan fight it got way better
[3:23:14] <Dunmarkh> yes
[3:23:16] <%Axellogic> BAKE A CAKE CRYSTAL BEARER
[3:23:17] <dredgyboi> but you need to get the cheese and wine pat
[3:23:17] <@commanderclaw> But then 2.55 hits and you nut
[3:23:17] <Brandon__Brando> its not fun to get into a game and hear ok you got to suffer
[3:23:17] <tanarath> The side quest quality varies wildly & the tone fluctuates between msq & side quests
[3:23:19] <ghosrevan> go down
[3:23:19] <Goraka91> The pre-Garuda stuff drags on, but only the second time
[3:23:20] <cpt_langosta> outside c-sec
[3:23:20] <James_Quivers> How the fuck did you miss BOTH tali and the researcher
[3:23:20] <%GuilKato> Pat you missed the researcher
[3:23:23] <RushUnplugged> no part of the game can be bad if Y'shtola exists
[3:23:23] <RaidenRising> dude heavensward was awesone , that final boss fight
[3:23:25] <supergoblinpunch> I'm playing it right now and loving it
[3:23:25] <StaceMcGate> the post-game of ARR is where most of the complaints come from
[3:23:26] <%GuilKato> sitting on the chair int eh courtyard
[3:23:29] <ammobasket> With the leveling rebalance you're through easily anyway
[3:23:30] <%Treuan> Fair
[3:23:31] <%InternetShis> You mean you don't like Tidus and Leviabeetus?
[3:23:32] <%JoshManVGH> Oh and the Ye olde English. That shit was wild.
[3:23:34] <valiard> I'm glad that mistake was only made 1
[3:23:34] <IntrepidEye> During the WoW exodus to XIV every single streamer I saw was told to rush through ARR to get to the expansions namely Shadowbringers as fast as possible
[3:23:35] <%Monkeyweed21> IT WAS THE SHIT WHEN IT CAME OUT
[3:23:37] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That was bad but it wasn’t too bad once you got past it
[3:23:38] <%cobalt_phoenix_> THAT'S MY FAVORITE THING TO SEE
[3:23:39] <tanarath> Yes?
[3:23:40] <Rao2357> My Stand, [Many Cutscenes Will Play]
[3:23:41] <+ALazo> I honestly think the way you go about the main plot in ARR is boring as hell, but the setting is really interesting to learn about
[3:23:49] <%shurtal> That IS a good part
[3:23:51] <+condemned_15> not Garrus
[3:23:51] <%RigmaroleHM> Must needs
[3:23:51] <%arizenarkana> Guild Wars 2's main story was so bad they introduced a series of Story Instance DLCs to make up for it lol
[3:24:01] <%RealThiele> best waifu
[3:24:04] <%ElkRiverDog> I’ve seen a bunch of people start ff14 and ARR seems like fun. Plus, the lore/story is actually important and carries through the entire game!
[3:24:05] <Vermillion129> I forgot all the shit I had to do to fight titan til you remind me
[3:24:08] <$Futurecity10> ah yes, Wheely deally arm no feely
[3:24:12] <28moogles> Gaius > Zenos, fight me
[3:24:14] <%MugenSandan> I think it's cause a bunch of new people enter into ARR after their friends hype up SHB and wonder what all the fuss is, don't give it a chance and leave
[3:24:15] <fusedforms> lets pause to take the speaking positions, Shepard
[3:24:20] <mr_saturday93> LUL
[3:24:21] <%JoshManVGH> This.... isn't where that happened...
[3:24:23] <Goraka91> God I used to think GW2 had a decent story, then I played 14, geez
[3:24:24] <%AncelDeLambert> wow, she ran her ass off pretty far to get to where you meet here if THIS is where she got shot
[3:24:24] <Brandon__Brando> no it wasn't
[3:24:25] <Profmcstevie> Oh god she was barrierless?
[3:24:28] <%InternetShis> Zenos boring
[3:24:36] <%RoldanDgr8> i played a realm reborn 2 weeks ago, and it was mixed for me. Heavenswards so far is so much better for me.
[3:24:37] <olaksi> "yeah I don't remember how we met" - best boyfriend
[3:24:39] <%JoshManVGH> Oooooh nvm
[3:24:46] <%InternetShis> I hope Endwalker makes Zenos cool
[3:24:47] <%JoshManVGH> Wrong thing I guess
[3:24:49] <Meekest> Polionium
[3:24:51] <+SaphronBlackbourne> I cannot wait to be done with Zenos
[3:24:52] <@QueequegTheater> I think this was before she met you
[3:24:53] <Goraka91> FUCKING POLONIUM
[3:24:56] <%Conscript_Gary> "Remember the ammo in ME1?"
[3:24:56] <mr_saturday93> remember when poison was a thing in ME
[3:25:00] <%cobalt_phoenix_> D:
[3:25:02] <peachy996> Was your arm bright green?
[3:25:03] <%AncelDeLambert> polonium rounds are so fucking NASTY, how is that shit even approaching legal
[3:25:06] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Zenos is just better Arthas
[3:25:06] <PaperyHornet1013> Your wife got shot Shepard
[3:25:09] <%kyh9> Remember: Shepard saves Tali from the SHADOW BROKER's assassins
[3:25:10] <ghosrevan> KILL HIM
[3:25:11] <T_Sasquatch> Oops
[3:25:14] <%cooldude69xx> Good thing that polonium was banned because fuck you
[3:25:15] <%Dakuu75> LET'S KILL HIM
[3:25:21] <SteelSnake93101> YES
[3:25:22] <Dunmarkh> Let's go fuck him up
[3:25:23] <lloyddboy> YEYEYEYEYE
[3:25:24] <Profmcstevie> It's ass whooping time
[3:25:26] <%JoshManVGH> let's go rub this in!
[3:25:27] <%TheWinged7> no do it standing
[3:25:29] <Parapattern> My GF asked for NO PICKLES
[3:25:29] <viewtifulr> Pray return to the walking sands return to End Walkers
[3:25:31] <Meekest> Tali is much nicer than you
[3:25:37] <lloyddboy> KICK OUT HIS BIRD SHINS
[3:25:39] <mandorlalmond> Cancel him on twitter
[3:25:42] <peachy996> Yes prove to the turian you are indeed a suit rat
[3:25:44] <%MidnightBurst12> lame
[3:25:47] <Dunmarkh> OH REALLY QUARIAN
[3:25:47] <%DrTomT18> we can save that for after the war
[3:25:49] <fusedforms> you can help his people _and_ give him shit
[3:25:49] <%Dakuu75> awwww
[3:25:49] <%Mekhet09> @PatStaresAt The stupidest part of the quarians is that they could have just gone to another planet. If it was like thane's race where they need specific environments it'd be a lot less stupid.
[3:25:50] <%Treuan> aww
[3:25:53] <%DrTomT18> fuck the Asari, that is all
[3:25:53] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah Pat stop holding grudges BabyRage

[3:26:39] <%JamesCorck> I have no idea what that was.
[3:26:40] <$hattrick61> him
[3:26:40] <Minorou> is the game falling apart again
[3:26:41] <viewtifulr> @JoshManVGH doodShake I know that Fate
[3:26:42] <@ssjklyco> IS this a side quest you forgot you had?
[3:26:47] <%JamesCorck> That must've been a bug.
[3:26:47] <%cooldude69xx> Shepard isnt the center of attention
[3:26:48] <+condemned_15> guy on couch?

[3:26:57] <%cooldude69xx> THIS time
[3:26:58] <dolphin1247> @Mekhet09 I think Tali addresses that in 2. As she put it, "Adapting to a new environment is the difference between 10 years and 100" if that's how the quote went. It would take longer to do and be much more difficult.
[3:26:59] <BigFingerRo> PAT TALKS TO HIMSELF

[3:28:52] <peachy996> Hmmmmmmm
[3:28:52] <Dabrikishaw> Mass Effect very much came out after the War of Terror started in 2004

[3:29:07] <ghosrevan> ummmm
[3:29:08] <%MightyDuckShoes> Shepard has strong Dubya vibes
[3:29:09] <tanarath> Yeah...
[3:29:11] <%JamesCorck> Shepard was partially based on Jack Bauer from "24".
[3:29:12] <%kyh9> And in ME3 it's "Dude, follow orders"
[3:29:12] <SteelSnake93101> Yeah America lost it'e fuckin' mind
[3:29:13] <+trashmanasam> GUYS HES TALKING ABOUT THE DEV CYCLE NOT THE RELEASE DATE

[3:29:15] <%DrTomT18> Pat, the dude you need to talk  to is down there

[3:29:20] <tanarath> It ruined a lot
[3:29:21] <Meekest> "Do you remember 9/11"
[3:29:21] <%kyh9> Yes
[3:29:22] <Brandon__Brando> I do
[3:29:22] <%whyskeywolfe> A scant 6 years after 9/11.
[3:29:28] <+D00msDayDan> i do remember you saying this during ME1
[3:29:30] <%RealThiele> damn kids
[3:29:30] <mandorlalmond> makes sense
[3:29:31] <%MidnightBurst12> I member
[3:29:32] <%ThomasOfTroy> That's also just a standard spy/secret agent/james bond thing, no need for war of terror stuff
[3:29:34] <@ssjklyco> So Garrus?
[3:29:34] <Parapattern> That's most super hero stories
[3:29:35] <Profmcstevie> The Reapers council "fucking lmao no way"
[3:29:38] <%afronooch> like its very GWB admin
[3:29:39] <+BlooBirdo> "emergency powers" was a popular plot point in the 00s LUL
[3:29:39] <%JamesCorck> Renegade Shepard is very much based on Jack Bauer from "24", which in itself was very much a post-9/11 War on Terror.
[3:29:40] <dredgyboi> i remember thia discussion in your me1 playthrough, its 100% true
[3:29:40] <d3ltuhhh> thanks council!
[3:29:41] <%AmericanSkidd> it was shit proof

[3:29:47] <+xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt You are 300% right
[3:29:47] <%MightyDuckShoes> The N7s and the Spectres are just Space Texas Rangers
[3:29:47] <+kettleroot> or the dlc that was just a terrorist strike
[3:29:47] <James_Quivers> That's true tho, beurocrats suck ass

[3:30:20] <%InternetShis> I JUST TURNED 22, I WAS 2 WHEN IT HAPPENED, I COULD NOT PHYSCIALLY REMEMBER
[3:30:21] <%MightyDuckShoes> It really was
[3:30:21] <dd44dostivei> 24 was a huuuuuge inspiration on this
[3:30:21] <%walternatorz> Pat, isn't your average viewer like 27?
[3:30:21] <bearwagon> i remember sundowner being a real person
[3:30:22] <%DrTomT18> Pat you walked right past the dude you were looking for
[3:30:22] <James_Quivers> *benches
[3:30:22] <%GuilKato> why do you keep leaving the courtyard
[3:30:22] <scrumbotime> The children don't know 9/11 happened Pat. They grew up in a world that was already crazy.
[3:30:22] <%JamesCorck> It was pretty bad.
[3:30:22] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt ME1 Pre-Production started in 2004. Big Iraq war vibes.
[3:30:23] <+Stormiercashew> how many more concepts can we declare war on
[3:30:23] <blackjack8182> Good times
[3:30:23] <+Ynkubus_> No, I just understood that context later on
[3:30:23] <Goraka91> 29
[3:30:24] <Dabrikishaw> Dark times really
[3:30:24] <luftraumm1> ME is heavy military propaganda

[3:30:25] <Yuroshi> was?
[3:30:25] <%NeoCre> I remember
[3:30:26] <%DrTomT18> blind
[3:30:27] <IntrepidEye> The rise of the Hard Men making Hard decisions
[3:30:27] <%AmericanSkidd> we still cant wear shoes through security pat WE KNOW
[3:30:28] <%DoubleRrico> i think my initial reaction at the time was "goo-goo-ga"
[3:30:28] <+PenmanLupine> if your younger than 25, go to sleep, ya'll got school tomorrow.
[3:30:28] <+Mr___Pillow> Oh I memb
[3:30:28] <olaksi> there's a reason people called it "post 9/11 era", it was in people's minds for a WHILE
[3:30:30] <%Monkeyweed21> I DONT KNOW WHAT SOCIETY WAS LIKE BEFORE IT
[3:30:30] <%GuilKato> you have looked directly at him 3 times
[3:30:30] <Silent_Fyraena> Pat I'm older than you, go fuck yourself. :P
[3:30:30] <sun312772> you forgot you were old pat?
[3:30:30] <peachy996> You're rambling old man
[3:30:31] <+condemned_15> It was nuts. I remember the insane censorship in media
[3:30:32] <+wmeldrum> remember the smallville episode where lana's bf goes to beat up terrorists??
[3:30:33] <BigFingerRo> 27
[3:30:34] <Thepothero> I do
[3:30:38] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Liberties went out the window
[3:30:38] <%JoshManVGH> The one hero who will save us from The Other! So long as they have unlimited immunity for war crimes
[3:30:38] <%RoldanDgr8> are you having a boomer moment, pat?
[3:30:40] <ghosrevan> pat thinks were all ten
[3:30:40] <+akscully> you twirled around them 6 times
[3:30:41] <viewtifulr> i was there
[3:30:41] <%Varlinator> You are stretching something CRAZY right now, Pat LUL
[3:30:41] <jorniev> IT WAS SO CRAZY, MY DAD almost got his butt checked because he looked the wrong shade of brown
[3:30:42] <dolphin1247> Dude, it wasn't a thousand years ago, amigo
[3:30:42] <%KineticZen> Google sucks, Altavista rules
[3:30:42] <%GuilKato> where the general turian was sitting
[3:30:43] <+ItalianWaifu> ok boomer
[3:30:44] <%kyh9> If you want to get a sense of what pre-9/11 society was like, unironically go watch the first season of Sex and the City
[3:30:45] <olm46> You are aging right now
[3:30:47] <tanarath> It was & is awful
[3:30:47] <%RealThiele> MASS EFFECT DEVELOPMENT STARTED IN 2003 PAT IS SUPER RIGHT
[3:30:47] <BigFingerRo> SET IN
[3:30:49] <@Ranryu692> I remember the damn Spider-Man trailer with the helicopter on the web between the twin towers
[3:30:49] <%mads_valentine> I would like to congratulate Terror for winning the War on Terror.
[3:30:50] <%Conscript_Gary> Pat's ingenious plan to get our ages so he can commit wire fraud
[3:30:51] <%Broand> everyone here is also old appearantly
[3:30:52] <%tusk102> i was 1 when 9/11 happened
[3:30:53] <%DrTomT18> PAT YOU WALKED PAST HIM
[3:30:54] <+sonuke_draws> I was alive
[3:30:55] <%NeoCre> Abu Graihb remembers…
[3:30:56] <Vermillion129> Boomer pasta rat ranting
[3:30:57] <Parapattern> Pat's right, but this is common stuff for most super hero stories
[3:31:00] <PaperyHornet1013> Actually blind
[3:31:03] <Thepothero> He forgor
[3:31:04] <Profmcstevie> "Preproduction of the game began in early 2004" apparently
[3:31:05] <BigFingerRo> Chaos won the war on terror
[3:31:07] <%Monkeyweed21> I was 4 when 9/11 happened I have no idea what life was like before it
[3:31:07] <cpt_langosta> post 9/11 america was PEAK cringe
[3:31:09] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt Look where SEPTIMUS was
[3:31:10] <%AmericanSkidd> remember when you went on to the phone internet it would screech at you?
[3:31:10] <%DrTomT18> open map
[3:31:12] <%KineticZen> I don't agree that this is the game version of 24
[3:31:12] <%GuilKato> Pat go to where General Septimus was sitting before
[3:31:13] <+InuOblivion> Anthrax was a thing back then
[3:31:14] <peachy996> That's still not 911
[3:31:15] <%mads_valentine> I was 3 on 9/11
[3:31:16] <ghosrevan> PAT GO BACK
[3:31:16] <+idyota> I was 5 when the twin towers were hit
[3:31:18] <%DrTomT18> 4
[3:31:19] <$Falilth> i hate constantly living in unprecidented times
[3:31:21] <%DrTomT18> area 4
[3:31:21] <+condemned_15> he's near sptimus
[3:31:22] <%SaiyanShoto> I was alive but I was 9 when 9/11 happened so I don’t remember that stuff or didn’t pay attention
[3:31:24] <peachy996> That's iraq
[3:31:25] <+Kyma1020> The game reeks of bush era jingoism
[3:31:29] <%Amused_Omnivore> Yahtzee made that analogy in his Zero Punctuation review. super accurate. I remember 9/11 vividly and yeah Mass Effect to is.
[3:31:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:31:29] <Dunmarkh> Pat you have a labeled map
[3:31:33] <alrobot2014> i was barely a year old when it happened
[3:31:34] <%LumberjackJack> Go back, do a loopty-loop
[3:31:34] <chancho4tierra> you walked next to him 10 times and the game hightlight him
[3:31:35] <PaperyHornet1013> He sits where the general sat
[3:31:36] <Dabrikishaw> Mass ffect plays like an unintelaional endorsement of the Bush adminsitration
[3:31:38] <%maskedsongbird> Evening, everyone. It's been a while.
[3:31:42] <%LumberjackJack> Then clap your hands
[3:31:44] <James_Quivers> The trope of the hardboiled lone badass who saves the day from shitty politicians has been around since the fuckin 70s, Pat
[3:31:47] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The 90's were the best
[3:31:49] <Profmcstevie> So said the same people of the past century
[3:31:51] <BigFingerRo> I was 8 when 911 happened
[3:31:51] <%JoshManVGH> psaBig Mood!
[3:31:51] <%ape_hawk> dont worry, guys, the earth will all be fire and lava in 10 years
[3:31:52] <roboyuji> Then when it was time for the War On Covid, we were all "eh,whatever".
[3:31:53] <%afronooch> 9/11 in the "Oooh-rah Fight terror" sense chat
[3:31:53] <smokios> how do you hate living in a time you've never been out of?
[3:31:54] <ExpressNode> Did Canada even get affected much by 9/11?
[3:31:54] <olaksi> it's really funny to me Bioware got this progressive clout because of all that stuff
[3:32:00] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt Even if we were alive for 9/11 we were still children with no experience to notice what it changed
[3:32:00] <ghosrevan> I miss saren
[3:32:02] <%DrTomT18> remember when things were nice?
[3:32:02] <Sp3ctre48> Look at how many "good choices" involve being a cop that appeals to everyone's morals to listen to authority Keepo
[3:32:03] <%Deadpal> I was 11.
[3:32:03] <%BinaryFireball> the one day I wanted to watch cartoons in the morning was 9/11 fucking worst luck ever
[3:32:03] <%GuilKato> psaBlind psaBlind
[3:32:04] <%ahomeschooldropout> @PatStaresAt You should really try to make the OG Deus Ex work because that shit was like a year before 9/11 and predicted how crazy that shit was
[3:32:06] <RushUnplugged> "the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind" people called it and BITCH it's sad people died but PLEASE
[3:32:09] <ThatGuyThere03> OH YOU FUCKING BET
[3:32:12] <%JoshManVGH> The world kinda did, yeah
[3:32:14] <BigFingerRo> I wish I could go back to the emo era and kick myself in the balls
[3:32:15] <Zombrocom> Hell yeah we did
[3:32:17] <%topendbuzza> the whole world did
[3:32:20] <%RealThiele> sure did canada was in afghanistan dna iraq
[3:32:21] <+Mr___Pillow> Invasion of Iraq was "02 and that year and following the antiterrorism in this states was wild. Lines up to what you you're saying
[3:32:21] <jorniev> yes
[3:32:23] <%GuilKato> a bunch of planes landed in middle of nowhere canada on 9-11 when american airspace closed
[3:32:23] <+condemned_15> There's a musical about NewFoundLand
[3:32:25] <JonKhan> birth cert wwas enough
[3:32:26] <%AmericanSkidd> WE CANT HAVE WATER ANYMORE
[3:32:29] <cpt_langosta> it's true, can confirm
[3:32:29] <mandorlalmond> even in Brazil I remember people always talking about it
[3:32:31] <%dekkitout> Travel was so much different before 9/11
[3:32:32] <%KineticZen> It's still fucking absurd that you need a passport today
[3:32:34] <vonmaultke> that and the news, no-one would ever shut up about it for 9 years
[3:32:36] <Brandon__Brando> then it takes one guy
[3:32:37] <%PunchSlugfest> Same with our Southern neighbor
[3:32:38] <%KineticZen> You needed your drivers' license
[3:32:39] <Astrophizz> and you could walk up to the gate without a ticket or id
[3:32:40] <%blue8moon> I remember when you could just walk around wherever you wanted in the airport
[3:32:43] <%RealThiele> yea plane travel became crap after 9/11
[3:32:43] <%kyh9> I don't remember if you needed to put your tech into the security scanner
[3:32:43] <notsoy> i remember the days when you could breeze through to the gate in like 15-30 min with your entire family seeing you off
[3:32:44] <sweet_jolyne> I mean if all you're implying Mass Effect reeks of post 911 military propoganda, you're def right
[3:32:47] <%tusk102> i've been living in unprecedented times since i was 1 years old since thats how old i was when 9/11 happened
[3:32:51] <%kyh9> IM TELLING YOU
[3:32:51] <dd44dostivei> 24 was a stated inspiration on ME
[3:32:52] <%JoshManVGH> We had that in Maine from this side
[3:32:52] <%LordMoonIV> enhanced driver's license is still a thing
[3:32:53] <RushUnplugged> 9/11 ruined flight checkups because TSA fooled people into thinking they're useful
[3:32:54] <%tyler274> white privlege
[3:32:55] <Latija> were you stuffed with drugs?
[3:32:56] <%stantheman_97> canadian went to Afghanistan with us
[3:32:56] <jorniev> again my dad got profilled because he looks kinda brown
[3:32:57] <%topendbuzza> I Got to be in a cockpit 747 as a kid before 9/11
[3:32:59] <%ThomasOfTroy> Canada sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, along with the US
[3:33:00] <Profmcstevie> The entire 2000s after 9/11 felt like a relentless loop in terms of news
[3:33:00] <JonKhan> I we always did birth cert, but that might've been later
[3:33:01] <%MightyDuckShoes> We were pretty free before 9-11. And the. freedom got a price tag.
[3:33:02] <%KineticZen> All the TERRISTS coming over the... Canadian border. Very logical W
[3:33:04] <%maskedsongbird> That shit's wild to me. I was six years old when 9/11 happened, so I grew up in the post-9/11 world. I literally can't fathom being able to fly without mountains of security to wade through.
[3:33:05] <+Mr___Pillow> When I was a kid we had silverware and spoke to the captain in the plane
[3:33:07] <%LumberjackJack> Now you gotta take off your shoes, have your shit scanned and x-ray'd, sometimes even broken, which causes serious line slowdown
[3:33:07] <%Mekhet09> The TSA wasn't a thing.
[3:33:08] <Parapattern> This game does have a lot of overlap with the message of The Dark Knight.
[3:33:09] <%kyh9> WATCH THE FIRST SEASON OF SEX AND THE CITY AND OBSERVE HOW RELAXED EVERYONE IS
[3:33:12] <tanarath> Passports in canada last 2 years now
[3:33:12] <%RealThiele> REMINDER: TSA FAILS 95% OF THEIR TESTS
[3:33:13] <mandorlalmond> true
[3:33:14] <%KineticZen> Or Rumsfeld or whatever other vampire implemented it
[3:33:17] <%AmericanSkidd> you just go

[3:33:19] <jorniev> BIG RACISM HAPPENED
[3:33:23] <DSD24> Now going to the airport is a pain
[3:33:23] <ExpressNode> I was like 9 when it happened so I don't remember much
[3:33:25] <$Falilth> oh yeah you could meet people at the gate
[3:33:26] <+akscully> 40 minutes?  10 minutes, running to the gate, more like
[3:33:26] <supergoblinpunch> the mass hysteria was real
[3:33:26] <dolphin1247> I've seen Home Alone 2, @PatStaresAt

[3:33:30] <%DrTomT18> the dude you are looking for is at the very end
[3:33:31] <%maskedsongbird> WAIT REALLY
[3:33:33] <%JoshManVGH> There is was a town in northern Maine that you could ONLY get to by driving into Canada and back into the US
[3:33:34] <%MightyDuckShoes> Home Alone could never happen today
[3:33:34] <scrumbotime> BIIIIIIG racism happened.
[3:33:34] <olaksi> a lot of the current surveillance dystopia also originates post 9/11
[3:33:37] <%kyh9> Go watch Independence Day
[3:33:37] <Zombrocom> 2 thirds of my life has been post 9/11, and it's coloured so much of my life at this point
[3:33:38] <%InternetShis> Country music died after 9/11
[3:33:39] <lloyddboy> they were just bus terminals but for planes
[3:33:39] <%tyler274> you can still hang out at smaller airports
[3:33:40] <%PunchSlugfest> I miss being able to see people walk off the plane
[3:33:42] <%TheWinged7> running through chicago airport yup
[3:33:46] <+condemned_15> I remember just going through to meet family
[3:33:47] <%TheWinged7> been there, done that
[3:33:47] <%GuilKato> yeah waiting for people at gate to arrive or going with them up until they go into the plane in the old days
[3:33:53] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt i've been living in "unprecedented times" since i was 1 since thats how old i was when 9/11 happened, fun times
[3:33:53] <+GTCknight> The opening of Die Hard
[3:33:54] <%SuckerPunchSyd> A good way to see that is watching the movie Airplane. Just walk right up to the gate
[3:33:55] <d3ltuhhh> james is chillin
[3:33:55] <%maskedsongbird> @InternetShis The one acceptable casualty.
[3:33:57] <%cobalt_phoenix_> @scrumbotime wdym happenED?

[3:34:01] <%blue8moon> you could just walk in with your fried who was leaving and see them off
[3:34:01] <%DashXero> Don't trust that Batarian, James!
[3:34:02] <Meekest> James please stop trying to clean out refugees
[3:34:05] <%DrTomT18> RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
[3:34:08] <smokios> it's his form of charity to them
[3:34:09] <ghosrevan> pat do you hate james?
[3:34:11] <%kyh9> I like to think James is losing on purpose

[3:34:12] <TioXyco> stop losing to batarians, you james!
[3:34:13] <%KineticZen> I really feel bad for people who weren't old enough to appreciate pre-9/11

[3:34:15] <%kyh9> And giving money away
[3:34:15] <+ItalianWaifu> Thank god we have the prothean beacon that is Home Alone 2 to tell us of the before times
[3:34:17] <+D00msDayDan> you can blow up both the twin towers and the statue of liberty yourself in Red Alert 2
[3:34:17] <%GuilKato> the refugee at end of hallway with turian
[3:34:18] <%demiiluna> it's charity to the refugees
[3:34:18] <AriThompsonArtwork> I feel like the war on terror is v much alive and ongoing in the minds of like 35% of Americans, its kinda nuts
[3:34:19] <%topendbuzza> he is making donates
[3:34:22] <%DrTomT18> BALD GUY
[3:34:23] <%Rumbutt> Vega isn't losing his money to the refugees, he's losing Kaiden's money to the refugees
[3:34:25] <%ironbologna> Remember that Robert Pattinson romance flick that ended in 9/11
[3:34:28] <%Monkeyweed21> please stop trying to hustle the desperate\
[3:34:29] <%stantheman_97> he took all of kaiden's money and is losing it to refugees
[3:34:30] <dolphin1247> Back in the Pre-9/11 days, we used to have sex on the wing of the plane.

[3:34:43] <%RealThiele> that nic cage 9/11 movie was also super cringe
[3:34:55] <%JoshManVGH> Pre 9-11 we had 3 Ninjas

[3:35:12] <%BinaryFireball> i ordered freedom fries  ironically as a kid
[3:35:12] <%blue8moon> Oh god I forgot about that NotLikeThis
[3:35:12] <+wmeldrum> @PatStaresAt that wasn't a joke????
[3:35:12] <@Ranryu692> I'm so glad there are people in chat who don't know about this
[3:35:12] <%dekkitout> I feel like America did that during one of the World Wars
[3:35:13] <%KineticZen> Christ people just became adult infants for so many years after the attack, it was so pathetic
[3:35:13] <%Jeemukun> I remember that
[3:35:14] <%shurtal> Shut up pat
[3:35:14] <Yuroshi> that was p. great
[3:35:14] <%Rumbutt> FREEDOM TOAST
[3:35:15] <mr_sups> Because the French would sign off on the Iraq war
[3:35:15] <%BinaryFireball> it was the best
[3:35:15] <Sp3ctre48> FREEDOM TOAST
[3:35:15] <@commanderclaw> I'M TAKING PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM REMEMBERING THAT SHIT
[3:35:15] <+NicheNova> Freedom Toast
[3:35:16] <%cvp5127> ?
[3:35:16] <%Archphronimos> That will forever be a fucking national shame
[3:35:16] <blackjack8182> LOTR The Two Towers
[3:35:17] <%Mekhet09> IT WAS SO STUPID.
[3:35:17] <James_Quivers> That happened literally nowhere, it was a non-story

[3:35:19] <wibbwobbler> LUL NotLikeThis
[3:35:20] <mr_saturday93> I GENUINELY FORGOT
[3:35:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> That was a push by some fucking idiots
[3:35:21] <%CalderGaming> that was real
[3:35:21] <TheIronBrass> Peak cringe
[3:35:22] <%ThomasOfTroy> @doc_ock_rokc Fuck yes it was
[3:35:25] <%KineticZen> We lost our ability to self-reflect as a culture and appreciate irony
[3:35:25] <@Spydurman> freedom toast
[3:35:25] <smoothwood07> oh god, iremember that
[3:35:25] <cpt_langosta> @PatStaresAt how did that look from your end?
[3:35:26] <Goraka91> KKona Nationalism brother
[3:35:26] <notsoy> half of us americans giggled and played along, the rest took it seirously
[3:35:27] <%demiiluna> When I was in elementary school in 2001, we had Japanese elementary school students come over for an exchange program. We were supposed to go over there next year, and then 9/11 happened and that shit got cancelled hard.
[3:35:27] <%AmericanSkidd> it was super real
[3:35:28] <%Jeemukun> that weird period where the US just, really hated France
[3:35:28] <%Rumbutt> that was super fucking real
[3:35:29] <James_Quivers> Literally no one did that
[3:35:29] <%NateyBeak> funnier than chugging horse meds? maybe
[3:35:30] <%SveriSageAdvice> they still call them freedom fries at the public pool in the town nearby
[3:35:30] <@commanderclaw> IT BURNS
[3:35:30] <%KineticZen> We still haven't recovered
[3:35:30] <%RyTYoung> You mean chips?
[3:35:30] <@ssjklyco> I lived it. It was real and dumb
[3:35:31] <%Amused_Omnivore> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah fucking hated it
[3:35:31] <+Mr___Pillow> French Tooast too
[3:35:32] <tanarath> Fucking freedom bullshit
[3:35:32] <@Ranryu692> it was a joke, just not to the people saying it
[3:35:33] <SteelSnake93101> vargUSA 'murica
[3:35:34] <%Fooguwu> IT WAS REAAAAL!!!
[3:35:34] <%DrTomT18> There are a TON of Law and Order episodes about the aftermath of 9/11 that got REALLY wild, including a dude claiming his wife died in one of the towers, when actually he murdered her.
[3:35:35] <peachy996> I will always REMEMBER "Freedom Fries"
[3:35:35] <TioXyco> well, better call it freedom fries than we give up fries
[3:35:36] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt Can you explain?
[3:35:36] <ghosrevan> yes it was a joke
[3:35:37] <%MightyDuckShoes> Tastes like America. Which happens to also taste like diabetes
[3:35:40] <%ThomasOfTroy> Freedom were a real and really fucking stupid thing
[3:35:41] <PaperyHornet1013> The Iraq war was pretty crazy
[3:35:41] <%JoshManVGH> That was like a US Consulate Cafeteria that started it
[3:35:43] <%MisterRockett> IT WAS BECAUSE FRANCE DISAGREED WITH AMERICA GOING TO WAR.
[3:35:43] <dd44dostivei> because the french opposed the iraq invasion
[3:35:44] <peachy996> And NOBODY called them Freedom Fries
[3:35:44] <%maskedsongbird> @PatStaresAt Oh god, the freedom fries.... Why must you remind me of one of my country's greatest shames???
[3:35:44] <%RetroCop87> It was only in the Southern states, Pat
[3:35:44] <%Fooguwu> IT WAS REAL!!!
[3:35:44] <ExpressNode> Freedom toast
[3:35:45] <%LordMoonIV> yeah, we have
[3:35:46] <Rao2357> I remember the Dixie Chicks being blacklisted for years for not blindly supporting all the horribly shit we were about to get up to
[3:35:47] <%LumberjackJack> In the states, we also had PSAs up the ass FROM THE DISNEY CHANNEL about how good Murica is. Imagine child Shia LaBeouff going "Murica awesome"
[3:35:48] <cpt_langosta> LOL
[3:35:49] <Latija> some things never change
[3:35:49] <@commanderclaw> Thanks US media, you ruined us
[3:35:49] <+BlooBirdo> uhhhh......
[3:35:50] <%PunchSlugfest> We sure did
[3:35:52] <ammobasket> That was super dumb
[3:35:52] <d3ltuhhh> I'm so glad I'm too young to have never heard of fucking freedom fries
[3:35:53] <Taco_Salsaguy> That was the dumbest
[3:35:53] <ThatGuyThere03> yeah
[3:35:54] <SteelSnake93101> I mean, we did
[3:35:55] <%dekkitout> Jingoism is weird in the states
[3:35:55] <%KineticZen> "France surrenders" hurrr hurr durr
[3:35:56] <%Broand> I was 9 and I thought it was dumb
[3:35:57] <@ssjklyco> We still haven't found our minds
[3:35:58] <%Monkeyweed21> YEA ABOUT THAT
[3:35:58] <%ape_hawk> the americans lost their minds when they colonized America
[3:35:58] <peachy996> Nobody in america called them freedom fries unironically
[3:36:00] <%topendbuzza> and to this day it is still ture
[3:36:02] <%JamesCorck> Oh man, this stream is going to be fun to see the YouTube comment section of.
[3:36:02] <Sp3ctre48> That's how it's been here for the past 20 years unfortunately
[3:36:02] <%JoshManVGH> Or the White House cafeteria, something dumb like that.
[3:36:03] <%maskofmichael> Can't lose your mind if you never had one
[3:36:03] <%luckyturtelle> extremely real. they put up signed in the congress cafeteria or whatever
[3:36:03] <%DianaTheAscian> Thats been the news since day one of the US
[3:36:05] <%DashXero> That's it?
[3:36:05] <+liquidzr0> "we"
[3:36:07] <+condemned_15> People wanted the title of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers changed because they thought it would remind people of the Twin Towers
[3:36:07] <%tank7013> I heard once that back in WWII people were calling saurkraut Liberty Cabbage. We have a history of this shit
[3:36:10] <scrumbotime> TH' TERRISTS WANT TO BLOW UP THE BIG BALL OF YARN
[3:36:12] <%AmericanSkidd> dont need a terrorist to do that
[3:36:14] <%ironbologna> Theres a restaurant called Mission BBQ that has everyone stand for the national anthem at like noon every day. Feels super weird and culty
[3:36:14] <%InternetShis> I'm American and literally who
[3:36:17] <lloyddboy> HALLOWEEN WAS REAL BAD THAT YEAR
[3:36:17] <Minorou> France has won more wars in history than any other country, hasn't it?
[3:36:19] <+ItalianWaifu> come on Pat Kansas only has the one station they get worried
[3:36:20] <%JamesCorck> This is what happens when Pat's Mind Goblins go out of control XD
[3:36:21] <%BinaryFireball> dude I lived by an airport where the planes would fly over my house  and be noisy as fuck... it was not good for my anxiety
[3:36:24] <%LumberjackJack> In the states, we also had PSAs up the ass FROM THE DISNEY CHANNEL about how good Murica is. Imagine child Shia LaBeouff going "'Murica awesome"
[3:36:24] <%demiiluna> I was there. I REMEMBER seeing "Freedom Fries" on the menu at the McDonalds Drive-Thru. It wasn't just a meme, it really happened in some places.
[3:36:26] <%maskedsongbird> Ugh....facepalm
[3:36:26] <James_Quivers> Pat, this is all things Canadians told themselves to serve the chip on their shoulders
[3:36:33] <%JamesCorck> Pat you're going super strong on the politics, it's great.
[3:36:33] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt There was a very real feeling of betrayal from a lot of people when France refused to help us in what was perceived as our darkest hour.  More Americans died on 9/11 than on Pearl Harbor
[3:36:33] <@ssjklyco> We at least got Team America World Police from it
[3:36:35] <%Rumbutt> The terrorists are everywhere Pat and they're out to get ME, AND MY FAMILY BECAUSE THEY HATE AMERICA
[3:36:37] <RushUnplugged> @PatStaresAt the goddamn Disney Channel uber-patriotic ads with the pre-teens saluting the flag and shit
[3:36:40] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah we still haven't rolled back any of the emergency powers granted to the goverment becsuse of 9-11...
[3:36:41] <%The_Protagonist> the White Supremacists are the ones that do that
[3:36:42] <IntrepidEye> To be fair even in America NOBODY took that Freedom Fries shit seriously except the crazies
[3:36:42] <%Monkeyweed21> @Minorou they've also lost tons of wars
[3:36:44] <+Grave_Titan_D> it happened in 2003 in my home state
[3:36:44] <%RealThiele> fucking everything is politics
[3:36:45] <%KineticZen> Trump was a dumbass but he's small freedom fries compared to W
[3:36:45] <dd44dostivei> and then their uncle would go and do it ten years later for alex jones
[3:36:45] <%DrTomT18> there is someone you  need to talk to here
[3:36:47] <%afronooch> youre american passing enough that we'll allow it
[3:36:49] <Sp3ctre48> I like how talking about stupid America things, keep going
[3:36:51] <blackjack8182> MATT DAMON
[3:36:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt apparently during ww2 we called sauerkraut "liberty cabbage'
[3:36:51] <%GuilKato> remember there is Angry Elchor at Purgatory
[3:36:51] <JonKhan> worht
[3:36:53] <%JamesCorck> When Woolie's back the next podcast is going to be 7 hours, and it's just going to be an uninterrupted rant from Pat.

[3:37:01] <%Mekhet09> People still hate it lol.
[3:37:02] <Rao2357> Renaming saurkraut during WW2 at least makes, like, some sense since it's German.
[3:37:03] <$Falilth> WE GOT MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE BECAUSE OF 9/11
[3:37:04] <%maskedsongbird> Yeah, with Team America, it wasn't all that bad.
[3:37:04] <%InternetShis> Worth it
[3:37:04] <%PunchSlugfest> Good movie pointing out how fucking stupid we are

[3:38:18] <%AmericanSkidd> what the hell does an Elcor husk look like
[3:38:19] <%MightyDuckShoes> Fucking Midwestern hicks trying to make a tragedy in LiberalLand all about them "It could happen 'ere!" No it couldn't, Harold. What's in Kansas?
[3:38:23] <Thepothero> Team America is fucking funny
[3:38:23] <scrumbotime> What the fuck would a reaper make out of an Elcor husk?
[3:38:24] <%JoshManVGH> I miss you more than that movoe misses the point
[3:38:24] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[3:38:25] <%MidnightBurst12> elcor warriors sound dooe

[3:38:27] <mandorlalmond> bronze boy
[3:38:27] <%GuilKato> they are living tanks!
[3:38:27] <+condemned_15> Matt Damon is voiced by Trey Parker
[3:38:29] <%stantheman_97> BIO TANKS
[3:38:29] <%cobalt_phoenix_> HELL YEA TANK ELCORS
[3:38:30] <%kyh9> ELEPHANT CANNONS
[3:38:33] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[3:38:36] <%Treuan> Elcor squadmate would have been rad
[3:38:36] <HarshNerf> the voice modulation makes this sound dumb

[3:38:38] <royvictus> "I have no mouth and i must do exposition"
[3:38:42] <Sp3ctre48> The fact that we've never seen Elcor tanks is such a missed opportunity
[3:38:42] <%kyh9> WHERE ARE THEY IN MULTIPLAYER
[3:38:44] <%DrTomT18> @scrumbotime a walking tank
[3:38:44] <Goraka91> CRAZY TALK
[3:38:46] <AngryAsian5> It's SUCH a crime that they mention that Elcors are "living tanks", AND THEY NEVER SHOW YOU. LUL
[3:38:48] <mr_saturday93> How much can. this guy lift?
[3:38:49] <%KineticZen> I wish that was true
[3:38:51] <%Lefanque> How do they fight? "Proudly" ah gotcha
[3:38:51] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It was a bit different for me, because I lived in Chicago, so the Sears Tower was FUCKING CLOSED for like 6 months
[3:38:51] <ghosrevan> matt damon was not in team america but he is cool with it
[3:38:52] <notsoy> the funny part is that team america influences everyone who yells at matt damon in public
[3:38:52] <%ape_hawk> yeah, but matt damon was more than cool with it
[3:38:52] <LightningLynx89> The reason why he mumbles "Maaat Daaaaamon" is because the doll looked nothing like Matt, so they basically made him a brainless idiot
[3:38:53] <%CapnBeefs> Elcors are just beast tankmen
[3:38:53] <%PunchSlugfest> CRAZY TALK
[3:38:53] <d3ltuhhh> @scrumbotime there was some concept art of it iirc and there's a mod that literally makes reaper elcor
[3:38:54] <%maskofmichael> Imagine if an Elcor stood up
[3:38:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> Matt Damon hated it but then leaned into it
[3:38:54] <%DashXero> Who loads the weapons? Who places them onto their backs? So many questions!
[3:38:57] <d3ltuhhh> it was super cool
[3:38:59] <Meekest> Kiss the Elcor on the face
[3:39:00] <Dunmarkh> @kyh9 they'd be too strong
[3:39:01] <%JonathLP> @PatStaresAt Matt is friends with them though. He said he didn't understand why they did it, but he found it funny.
[3:39:01] <%Deft_Thought> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaWrong
[3:39:02] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt during ww1 sauerkraut was called "liberty cabbage" and hamburgers were called "liberty steaks" renaming shit is what we do here in the us for some reason
[3:39:02] <%walternatorz> he was supposed to be normal but I think they saw how dumb the puppet looked and ran with it
[3:39:03] <+condemned_15> go eat your horsey paste dear
[3:39:08] <@ssjklyco> Matt Damon is voice by Trey Parker Voiced by Ben Aflek
[3:39:10] <Virokwet> crazy talk got em again
[3:39:11] <%Conscript_Gary> imagine en elcor squadmate
[3:39:11] <scrumbotime> Elcor are bulldogs of people
[3:39:12] <DSD24> Isn't the story that they couldn't figure out anything to make fun of Matt Damon cause he was so nice
[3:39:12] <%JoshManVGH> @scrumbotime I imagine it would be something like that one Jedi with the super destructive scream. Just a walking sound cannon
[3:39:22] <%DrTomT18> I heard that part of the reason you rarely see Elcor move is because their model rigging is a bitch to work with
[3:39:23] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I just imagine elcor walking around like Heavy ARms Gundam
[3:39:25] <jorniev> can an elcor punch someone?
[3:39:34] <notsoy> tbh i would be mad if when people yelled to me in public, they acted like a disabled person
[3:39:36] <Treasure_Vault> I think the US also had like Liberty Gardens, which were just gardens!
[3:39:38] <%kyh9> FUCKING
[3:39:40] <mandorlalmond> imagine a indocrinated elcor
[3:39:41] <@commanderclaw> French Fries aren't even French in origin, they're Belgian!

[3:39:54] <%AmericanSkidd> They remember 9/11 every year
[3:39:54] <Sp3ctre48> Yeah but they had the france word in it
[3:39:55] <peachy996> That's why it's SO funny
[3:39:56] <LightningLynx89> Belgium, a country that shouldn't exist

[3:42:45] <%KineticZen> Saw so many previously-sane Boomers lose their goddamn minds after 9/11
[3:42:45] <%maskedsongbird> I heard about the Dixie Chicks thing like a decade after the fact, because I don't give a shit about country music.
[3:42:46] <scrumbotime> The Dixie Chicks actually spoke out against the war and shit and that was the moment country music rose up, and became a circlejerk of "patriotism"
[3:42:47] <Virokwet> it do be like that
[3:42:51] <dd44dostivei> they dumped on bush at a concert
[3:42:51] <%RealThiele> cancel culture as a term is the dumbest shit
[3:42:54] <%DrTomT18> remember that documentary where 2 dudes went to hang out with some fire fighters and it just HAPPENED to be on 9/11
[3:42:59] <+wmeldrum> 2001 was a hoot and a half....

[3:44:25] <%MidnightBurst12> so is the English language?
[3:44:26] <%JoshManVGH> On account that New is Better
[3:44:27] <+Havictos> Most "american" foods were just brought over from other cultures
[3:44:29] <BigFingerRo> EVERYTHING IS LIES BRUDDA
[3:44:30] <%topendbuzza> I from a country that lost a war to an over sized flightless bird and I still laugh at the yanks
[3:44:31] <%ThomasOfTroy> First recorded appearance for apple pie is in 1381 in England
[3:44:32] <@QueequegTheater> DISINFO DISINFO NOOOOO
[3:44:32] <Dunmarkh> The Americans conquered that pie in the revolution
[3:44:34] <%CalderGaming> Actually American foods: orange chicken, general tso's chicken, fortune cookies, chicken kiev,
[3:44:34] <%bahookery> your apple pie is as english as tea and crumpets
[3:44:34] <@QueequegTheater> DELETE THIS
[3:44:34] <@commanderclaw> Apple pie isn't even the best fruit pie
[3:44:38] <%maskedsongbird> @Yudouuuuuuu Hey fuck you, we got BBQ
[3:44:40] <olaksi> no one else has liquified cheese and put it in a bottle though, so americans have that going for them
[3:44:42] <Minorou> Of course America has its own food. Like deep fried stuff. And McDonalds
[3:44:42] <$hattrick61> Did you guys know America itself is also originally british?
[3:44:44] <%walternatorz> they probably boiled it instead of baking it
[3:44:44] <%JoshManVGH> I mean look at York, who wants to go there? Nobody, New York
[3:44:46] <LightningLynx89> Pat the English language originates from German
[3:44:47] <@Ranryu692> America should invade England for this affront
[3:44:47] <Meekest> Apple pie is pr good tho
[3:44:48] <%kyh9> PECAN PIE BROS, WHERE WE AT
[3:44:50] <%AmericanSkidd> You laugh but McDonalds took over the world
[3:44:51] <stranger59> Pizza as we know it is more American.
[3:44:52] <%faldin> what about peach cobbler
[3:44:53] <%DianaTheAscian> The united states was an English invention technically @PatStaresAt
[3:44:54] <peyodogo> hi laura bailey
[3:44:54] <Silent_Fyraena> You guys need to fuck off with the English food is bad stuff. English people know how to make good food. They just don't want to eat it because they got a taste for poverty food.
[3:44:55] <peachy996> Pumpkin Pie is better
[3:44:56] <%DrTomT18> WE TOOK IT AND MADE IT OUR OWN
[3:44:56] <+Mr___Pillow> Internet and TV be 'Merican iirc
[3:44:58] <%ThomasOfTroy> @Dunmarkh We stole the only good piece of British cuisine

[3:45:07] <ammobasket> big true metaphor there
[3:45:07] <BigFingerRo> @commanderclaw wow, what's it feel to be the wrongest man on chat?
[3:45:08] <%DrTomT18> shut up pat your french
[3:45:08] <+ScrapKingKeita> is the other side originally French?
[3:45:09] <James_Quivers> We claimed the apple pie after the war, that was one of the conditions
[3:45:09] <%topendbuzza> well
[3:45:09] <smoothwood07> blasphemy! lol
[3:45:10] <notsoy> yeah, still pretty american in the end, just not as flattering
[3:45:11] <%SABiscotti> Our first president at the VERY least spoke with a British accent
[3:45:12] <%InternetShis> I severely doubt that because England can't cook for shit and we have visual proof of this today
[3:45:14] <cpt_langosta> pip pip, m8

[3:45:23] <$hattrick61> you know what else is american? the moon
[3:45:23] <%Conscript_Gary> Dickwaving over who 'invented' a food when it's completely unrecognizable from its origins is silly. Like I said, pizza. American pizza is its wholeass own thing now.
[3:45:26] <MarylandJutsu> the other half is from stinky france
[3:45:29] <dd44dostivei> isn't toronto founded by americans who were loyal to the crown
[3:45:30] <blackjack8182> America was british so it still counts
[3:45:31] <+Havictos> @topendbuzza The Great Emu war taught me they are to be feared
[3:45:33] <%KineticZen> Cornish pasties? Fish and chips?
[3:45:34] <T_Sasquatch> @silent_fyraena mhmm yea British good like fucking baked beans

[3:46:05] <ryderbootz> my ancestors are smiling at me, can you say the same?
[3:46:06] <%KineticZen> That was clearly the best invention

[3:47:25] <%polothegreatest> chop suey is american
[3:47:26] <%MightyDuckShoes> so is Pizzaghetti like a deep dish pizza? is it spaghetti in a bread bowl?
[3:47:26] <@Ranryu692> Maybe Canada invented a specific kind of blood pudding
[3:47:26] <%ironbologna> KRAFT
[3:47:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> You MONSTERS also made Hawaiian Pizza
[3:47:27] <+Yudouuuuuuu> to be honest food made out of coagulated blood has been created independently in a bunch of places
[3:47:29] <%faldin> it's just ham!!
[3:47:30] <Silent_Fyraena> I remember lulling at 'freedom fries' when people were raging against the French for.. I forget... not wanting to go to war against 'terror' or something I assume?
[3:47:30] <dredgyboi> blood pudding tastes great btw
[3:47:32] <James_Quivers> Or not, nevermind

[3:47:46] <%ironbologna> Steamed hams
[3:47:48] <@Ranryu692> ham is underrated as a pig meat
[3:47:48] <Sp3ctre48> I'm so excited for this bullshit
[3:47:48] <%Mekhet09> @stranger59 It was a bombshell when it happened.
[3:47:49] <tanarath> Hawaiian pizza is Canadian? nice
[3:47:50] <%JoshManVGH> @dd44dostivei I just learned about this today! Ham comes from the legs, Bacon thr belly, Canadian bacon thr back
[3:47:52] <Profmcstevie> if canadian bacon is ham, what do they call bacon bacon

[3:48:08] <%DianaTheAscian> sick
[3:48:09] <%The_Protagonist> I'm assuming it's because it's ham that's supposed to be more prepared LIKE bacon? but a lot of times it's not
[3:48:09] <+Yudouuuuuuu> American Chinese is distinctly American actually
[3:48:10] <Goraka91> Checks out

[3:48:23] <Goraka91> For now
[3:48:26] <%DrTomT18> Hey pat, save the Elcor
[3:48:26] <%DianaTheAscian> By that logic space is russia
[3:48:26] <%sporeian94> well if it makes you feel any better America probably won't be a country anymore in 30 years or so
[3:48:28] <%Deadpal> uhhh. Pat that was defunct when we made the space force.
[3:48:28] <+Havictos> For now
[3:48:29] <mikeriffic> yea but we got our flag on it so murica
[3:48:29] <%MelBrooksKA> Isn't American cheese Canadian?
[3:48:30] <%Axellogic> Speaking of canada what happened to Justin Beiber?
[3:48:30] <%AmericanSkidd> Real Hawaiian Pizza is made with Spam
[3:48:31] <@commanderclaw> That will last until we can start making money off of space rocks
[3:48:31] <%blue8moon> for now
[3:48:31] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Italy two most famous food pizza and pasta are not fully Italian. Pizza uses tomatoes a new world fruit and Pasta is from china
[3:48:32] <%logoth_> The Moon Belongs to America - And awaits the arrival of our ASTRO MEN. Will -YOU- be among them?
[3:48:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> BUT WHO HAS A FLAG ON THE MOON PAT
[3:48:32] <@ssjklyco> It won't stop amazon from trying

[3:48:33] <@Ranryu692> Take our flag down then
[3:48:33] <stranger59> @Mekhet09 I guess I'm just used to it, it's been so long.
[3:48:34] <Sp3ctre48> That's what it says in the title
[3:48:34] <Tracazoid> They'll totally keep that pact
[3:48:34] <James_Quivers> That treaty is just cope for the countries that haven't been there
[3:48:34] <Dunmarkh> You think America honors treaties?
[3:48:35] <%afronooch> Treaties are suggestions for America, Pat
[3:48:35] <%maskedsongbird> Fuck your treaties, the moon's American as fuck, lol
[3:48:35] <%Deadpal> and china has also agreed to ignore that.
[3:48:35] <dd44dostivei> yeah that treaty is fake
[3:48:35] <DSD24> What about the Federation of Zeon?
[3:48:35] <peachy996> For now
[3:48:36] <@QueequegTheater> WE WERE THERE FIRST, FUCK OFF
[3:48:37] <%Deadpal> :/
[3:48:37] <scrumbotime> Don't worry, America WILL break that.
[3:48:37] <%InternetShis> No
[3:48:39] <%dekkitout> America also has dibbs on a section of Antarctica
[3:48:40] <%afronooch> we dont follow those
[3:48:41] <Minorou> Corporations are 100% going to own the moon in the future
[3:48:41] <%cade_calrayn> the X-Men claimed Mars though
[3:48:44] <%stantheman_97> space is for all humanity
[3:48:44] <+PARARScs> OUR FLAG IS ON IT ITS OURS
[3:48:44] <%RigmaroleHM> Pretty easy to overturn that with a little war
[3:48:45] <+miguelrod777> sounds like coward talk moon is america fuck yeaaaaa
[3:48:45] <%RealThiele> treaties only last until someone puts an excavator on the moon
[3:48:45] <%GuilKato> yeah that treaty is null and void the moment people start mining the moon
[3:48:45] <Profmcstevie> "No gundam shit" treaty
[3:48:46] <cpt_langosta> RIP "The Man Who Sold the Moon"
[3:48:46] <%cade_calrayn> and terraformed the shit out of it
[3:48:47] <+GemeSvev> So what happens when we colonize space? Do we make new space laws?
[3:48:48] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt ironically california rolls were invented in canada by a japanese immigrant
[3:48:49] <peachy996> Aliens will see our flag first though
[3:48:50] <HeroToxiko> you know damn well america won't honour that LulzorGG

[3:48:58] <+xerotwo> FOR NOW
[3:49:00] <olaksi> wouldn't want to anger the aliens
[3:49:00] <%Dakuu75> Sucks for you Weyland-Yutani
[3:49:02] <%MightyDuckShoes> @silent_fyraena  We were already fighting in Afghanistan and thought "Why not multitask in Iraq." So France was like... no, man. we do business with Iraq. And America flipped shit
[3:49:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> WE HAVE THE MOON WOOP WOOP
[3:49:02] <ryderbootz> like i know, but we could just break that shit with like 0 repercussions
[3:49:03] <+Mr___Pillow> There is dude selling space and moons to people despite that in a legal gray area 😆
[3:49:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt california rolls, despite being called california, were invented in canada
[3:49:06] <MarylandJutsu> @QueequegTheater technically the first in space proper was Russia
[3:49:06] <%TheWinged7> except the satelites in orbit @PatStaresAt
[3:49:06] <Goraka91> Corporations will make a new law around it LUL
[3:49:07] <%JoshManVGH> Well that's about to change thanks to SPACE FORCE!
[3:49:07] <%Taisuru> Nobody will claim sovereignty, until they can
[3:49:09] <%DianaTheAscian> also Antarctica
[3:49:10] <dd44dostivei> the space race was new colonialism
[3:49:10] <%dekkitout> Not enough money can be made off of space... yet
[3:49:13] <+Mr___Pillow> He's made millions
[3:49:14] <$Falilth> psh i own a star the certficiate says so
[3:49:14] <%logoth_> @logoth_ damn straight
[3:49:14] <Minorou> just ignore all those scam companies that sell ownership of stars in the skie
[3:49:15] <%topendbuzza> usa know rules followers
[3:49:18] <%AmericanSkidd> Would you rather it be owned by say, China?
[3:49:18] <+Yudouuuuuuu> space ads
[3:49:18] <HeroToxiko> LulzorGG that wasn't @ you you just have an unfortunate name LUL
[3:49:19] <Tracazoid> One day: Space billoards selling you shit
[3:49:21] <%polothegreatest> deliver us the moon
[3:49:21] <@Ranryu692> the moon is in orbit
[3:49:22] <@Ranryu692> blame
[3:49:23] <%TheWinged7> ok fair
[3:49:23] <Treasure_Vault> I mean you can just take a sattelite, no one can stop you
[3:49:24] <%DrTomT18> @AmericanSkidd yes, during WW2 Spam was the only meat the Hawaiians could get a hold of, so they ended up incorporating them into  a lot of their meals
[3:49:24] <%walternatorz> I'm a sovereign citizen and I claim the moon.
[3:49:27] <+xerotwo> It's either Bezos or Elon going to dodge them bullets for the moon Kappa
[3:49:28] <smoothwood07> dont worry Kakashi will almost blow it up
[3:49:29] <%Conscript_Gary> Satellites also aren't territory, they're objects
[3:49:30] <Tracazoid> *Billboards*
[3:49:31] <@Ranryu692> LUL
[3:49:33] <%ThomasOfTroy> Yes it is
[3:49:33] <Jmann1892> Is that why Obama didn't let us turn the moon into a Death Star?
[3:49:33] <%InternetShis> Say that to this ICBM
[3:49:34] <stranger59> Elon will buy space just to fill it with child soldiers he can steal blood emeralds from.
[3:49:35] <%dekkitout> Like above the Carmen line?
[3:49:35] <peachy996> Oh my god I can't imagine this pychotic earth getting to finally claim space for themselves
[3:49:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Reminder that Jeff Bezos unironically wants to create  The Expanse in real life
[3:49:37] <%DracosMagala> LUL
[3:49:37] <+ScrapKingKeita> Satelites are in low-orbit
[3:49:39] <supergoblinpunch> Like China or Murica gives a fuck about treaties
[3:49:40] <James_Quivers> I think people are tryna claim asteroids for resources
[3:49:41] <%afronooch> Spam rules too
[3:49:42] <peachy996> The America Quadrant
[3:49:44] <%ironbologna> The atmosphere?
[3:49:45] <@Ranryu692> What do you mean
[3:49:47] <%Ancopro> earth public domain
[3:49:50] <%stantheman_97> objects made by man don't count
[3:49:52] <Treasure_Vault> There aren't space cops to stop you from stealing a satellite. Just do it, coward.
[3:49:52] <%tusk102> the gundam conflict
[3:49:53] <%Axellogic> Have I been mendela'd into thinking the ship has a boost button
[3:49:55] <Brandon__Brando> that shits not going to last
[3:49:55] <dredgyboi> the moon is a satelite
[3:49:55] <%RealThiele> earths AT field
[3:49:57] <%ThomasOfTroy> No it isn't, that's technically in spice by international law
[3:49:57] <%JoshManVGH> it's only slightly higher than that Amazon dude went
[3:50:00] <@QueequegTheater> Pat do you smell burning toast
[3:50:01] <smoothwood07> @afronooch fuck yeah spam
[3:50:02] <%TheWinged7> right, i forgot they are in LEO
[3:50:04] <cpt_langosta> Gundam Narrator: "The United Earth-sphere Alliance..."
[3:50:05] <%Agami23> remember jeff bezos didnt actually go to space
[3:50:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Technically pat due to the fact that They changed the definition of atumosphere the moon is in earth's atomosphere and thus is in earth's domain
[3:50:09] <%walternatorz> pat only expert on orbs, not spheres
[3:50:10] <%AmericanSkidd> @AmericanSkidd and Spam on Pizza is better than ham
[3:50:10] <peachy996> The Mexican Traverse
[3:50:10] <%DianaTheAscian> Space belongs to to spacenoids
[3:50:10] <%topendbuzza> what about james webb once it's up?
[3:50:12] <BigFingerRo> @supergoblinpunch We can't honest to goodness say that until the Big War happens
[3:50:15] <%IamGrapes> what about that car that Elon Musk threw into space?
[3:50:18] <Silent_Fyraena> Pat being rusty on sphere is fucking IRONY
[3:50:18] <peachy996> The Belgian Cluster
[3:50:20] <Goraka91> Nusphere? Is that real or just a Stalker thing?
[3:50:22] <olaksi> I really hope one of those billionaire space craft explodes in orbit
[3:50:22] <+ReallyBigRocks> Space starts at 100km
[3:50:26] <Profmcstevie> Gief winning that argument
[3:50:28] <%shurtal> Spheres, conjunction of
[3:50:28] <%Conscript_Gary> Nasa doesn't want you to know this but the satellites in orbit are free, you can just take them home
[3:50:33] <%dekkitout> *The Karman line, where atmosphere stops and space starts
[3:50:34] <%Taisuru> I say countries should be able to own a section of space the exact size and shape of their country
[3:50:34] <%DrTomT18> Jeff Bazos did not go to space in his penis rock
[3:50:36] <%JoshManVGH> You went to tall earth
[3:50:38] <supergoblinpunch> we can take a good guess tho
[3:50:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOBODY HAS GONE TO SPACE...technically
[3:50:41] <%thedankestmeeme> you're sounding real flat earthy right now pat
[3:50:42] <%DrTomT18> he just went really high uop
[3:50:44] <Silent_Fyraena> @PatStaresAt The Ligmasphere
[3:50:45] <scrumbotime> Beff Jezos took a really high airplane and then wanted to be called a spaceman
[3:50:47] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt thats why jeff bezos isnt an astronaut
[3:50:48] <Treasure_Vault> I don't wanna go to space in any flight I can't sleep through
[3:50:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> Bezos also didn't go to orbit, he just went straight up
[3:50:52] <%DrTomT18> oh, Pat, you HAVE to bring Javik
[3:50:53] <%faldin> what?
[3:50:54] <stranger59> @Agami23 You mean when he want "near" space but still caused more pollution than you will in your entire lifetime?
[3:50:56] <%DrTomT18> on this next mission
[3:50:57] <%ThomasOfTroy> So Yuri Gagarin didn't go to space, got it
[3:50:57] <%Deadpal> who said flat earth what.
[3:50:59] <%ironbologna> Pat is gatekeeping space guys
[3:51:00] <James_Quivers> Flat Eussy
[3:51:05] <%AmericanSkidd> it was real long fall
[3:51:08] <%stantheman_97> there is no strict definition on what counts as earth and space due to there being no hard barrier
[3:51:09] <+Sadira_snack_attack> bro?
[3:51:10] <%afronooch> It's like putting your foot out the door and saying you went outside
[3:51:11] <BigFingerRo> @Conscript_Gary Nah, I'm pretty sure they'll want it back if you take em
[3:51:12] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat is actually acknowledging the Earth as a fucking SPHERE
[3:51:12] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Space is defined by the Carmen line which is 100km
[3:51:14] <%Agami23> @stranger59 you know it
[3:51:14] <cpt_langosta> ew, earth goo
[3:51:15] <Treasure_Vault> You sound like one of those sphere earthers
[3:51:15] <%RealThiele> Earth-chan not flat
[3:51:18] <%InternetShis> Jeff Bezos is not an astronaut, he's a passenger and a criminal
[3:51:19] <BigFingerRo> they're not ducks in the park
[3:51:22] <%topendbuzza> you can tell buzz he never left earth then
[3:51:23] <HeroToxiko> Rich dirtbags doing a halo drop isn't spaceflight
[3:51:25] <%thedankestmeeme> oh now I'm sus
[3:51:27] <peachy996> Earth is a Triangle
[3:51:29] <+ALazo> pat the spacekeeper
[3:51:29] <lloyddboy> what if you crash into the ice wall tho??
[3:51:31] <T_Sasquatch> The earth IS flat you fucks
[3:51:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @stantheman_97 there is.
[3:51:32] <chancho4tierra> A Chilean owns the moon before the landing, he paid his contributions and all
[3:51:32] <%TheWinged7> playing devils advocate here but does that mean the people in the ISS arent astronauts?
[3:51:33] <%ironbologna> Pat says if you go to Space on easy mode it doesnt count
[3:51:33] <alrobot2014> does your soul need to become unbound from gravity?
[3:51:34] <%Deadpal> wait what
[3:51:35] <%The_Protagonist> @stantheman_97 there is a literal barrier. it's called the atmosphere
[3:51:39] <jorniev> IF you are not suffering from the horrible effects of lack of gravity  you are not an astronaut
[3:51:42] <%Deadpal> oh
[3:51:42] <%DianaTheAscian> LUL LUL LUL
[3:51:43] <Dio_TR> Can't believe Pat is gatekeeping space travel Kappa
[3:51:43] <BigFingerRo> HALELILOLULELO
[3:51:45] <%Deadpal> so ONLY 100km up?
[3:51:46] <%BinaryFireball> MAKE THE EARTH FLAT AGAIN
[3:51:46] <+KaguraRaion> @thedankestmeeme yea wtf are you talking about lol
[3:51:47] <%Mekhet09> What the fuck is the icewall.
[3:51:48] <%Deadpal> that's... not that far lol
[3:51:49] <%DianaTheAscian> SHHHHHHHHHH
[3:51:51] <ExpressNode> Flat earth is stupid but reading about it is intriguing
[3:51:51] <%DrTomT18> Earth actually has a dome over it
[3:51:51] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the "you have to hit a certain distance" is why jeff bezos isnt considered an astronaut so thank god for that
[3:51:53] <%dekkitout> The thermosphere is where space might as well start
[3:51:55] <Treasure_Vault> How will global climate change effect the ice wall?
[3:51:55] <%JoshManVGH> Shhhhh ice wall is secret
[3:51:55] <%hrbeck_> Getting some boss baby vibes from this space talk
[3:51:56] <Latija> they're coming!
[3:51:57] <%DrTomT18> going to space is impossible
[3:51:59] <scrumbotime> The rocket is strong enough to break through the ice wall DUH
[3:52:00] <Jmann1892> Its too late tell us of the ice wall
[3:52:01] <James_Quivers> It's not an ice wall it's an accretion disc, guys
[3:52:01] <%stantheman_97> NASA IS LISTENING
[3:52:01] <%GuilKato> do you do thesisa before DLC?
[3:52:01] <+Havictos> PAt
[3:52:03] <%InternetShis> EARTH BOWL
[3:52:03] <%Mekhet09> Is the icewall flat earth shit.
[3:52:03] <%AmericanSkidd> The CIA is on their way
[3:52:03] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat 100km is not that far a car can make that distance in 1 hour.
[3:52:05] <%Agami23> man, i lost it when i learned the ice wall is in fate
[3:52:06] <%afronooch> oh nooo
[3:52:06] <%JoshManVGH> Ice Wall Spoilers! God damn it!
[3:52:06] <%maskedsongbird> Wtf is the ice wall?
[3:52:09] <stranger59> If Pat's stream ends it's because he knows about the Ice Wall.
[3:52:11] <cpt_langosta> did you know dragons live in space and eat stars its true
[3:52:13] <%AJ_Cherenkov> Real talk, maps of alleged past the ice wall stuff would make for a rad fantasy setting
[3:52:13] <+akscully> keep it secret keep it safe

[4:00:53] <%AmericanSkidd> eh, let them believe it
[4:00:54] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater EA is a disgruntled ex?
[4:01:00] <%DrTomT18> Don't worry, Asari will just re-write the histories in 500 years
[4:01:00] <$hattrick61> PREORDER MONEY BAYBEE
[4:01:03] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, even like once?

[4:01:16] <+cunningchaff> Day 1 DLC installed on the disc even
[4:01:17] <%AmericanSkidd> what a pretty corpse of a husk of a planet
[4:01:19] <Profmcstevie> Put the fires out in your imagination
[4:01:21] <%Deft_Thought> Imagine seeing planets where the various beings in the universe actually live
[4:01:22] <kikoeru_san> no you cannot see a planet full of sexy blussy
[4:01:23] <%logoth_> Javik is telling Liara to *USE IT*
[4:01:26] <+Soliloquy123> Look guys Liara's sad don't you love Liara? Why don't you feel sad for Liara her planet is being invaded :(
[4:01:28] <%CalderGaming> @DrTomT18 well. depends on the ending.
[4:01:29] <%Deft_Thought> Instead of a dirt colony
[4:01:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:01:32] <Treasure_Vault> Why doesn't the alliance just set the reapers to narrative?
[4:01:34] <+Havictos> @PatStaresAt I wish we could have explored more inhabited worlds without a war in the way you know?
[4:01:35] <%blue8moon> I'm sad the asari don't have their own gunship design
[4:01:35] <Meekest> Wow Shepard you're really strong
[4:01:38] <jorniev> thats a big gun
[4:01:39] <ohno778> FUCK COVER
[4:01:40] <%tusk102> that guns fun
[4:01:40] <%logoth_> USE. IT.
[4:01:41] <%maskedsongbird> The fact that the Legendary compilation exists without DLC hurdles makes me retroactively wish I never bought the original trilogy back in the day in the first place...
[4:01:42] <AthenaAegis> GET SOME...or something
[4:01:45] <%YakumoYomi> Easy there, Rambo
[4:01:47] <%RealThiele> baby mode enhancement
[4:01:49] <Johndagger17> big man
[4:01:53] <%dekkitout> @QueequegTheater Surely, they're nice enough to let you see the kids. Mass Effect, Dead Space, Crysis...
[4:01:54] <%The_Protagonist> Lookin Cool, Shepard
[4:01:54] <cpt_langosta> but is he as brave as wario?
[4:01:58] <BigFingerRo> TSUYOI
[4:01:58] <lloyddboy> proportional strength of a baby
[4:02:01] <%Mekhet09> The power of a narc.
[4:02:01] <ExpressNode> Blussyia
[4:02:01] <%AmericanSkidd> it pretty much is
[4:02:02] <kikoeru_san> wait...no Shotgun?
[4:02:02] <BurdRightsActivist> Did pat go on easy mode? lol
[4:02:05] <blackjack8182> Baby mode buff
[4:02:07] <peachy996> "Nooo look at how horrible Thessia looks like this" You've been to Earth, You've seen Tuchanka and you saw Palaven from Orbit on FIRE
[4:02:08] <Sp3ctre48> Guys it's so sad that Liara's planet is being invaded, don't you feel bad for her BibleThump
[4:02:10] <Treasure_Vault> It's kind of like how in Star Trek you get to visit a bunch of planets without them all being attacked by the same dudes
[4:02:11] <ohno778> HAD fire support
[4:02:11] <%topendbuzza> thats a dragon
[4:02:11] <fusedforms> those things look so dumb haha
[4:02:12] <stranger59> That a frickin' dragon?
[4:02:14] <Zeif00> LUL
[4:02:15] <%AmericanSkidd> You can
[4:02:15] <%tusk102> it is the m60 of this universe tbh
[4:02:16] <d3ltuhhh> surprise: harvester!
[4:02:18] <James_Quivers> Liara is in full cope mode
[4:02:18] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I did say it was an LMG
[4:02:20] <%NeoCre> Action Hero
[4:02:21] <@ssjklyco> I mean, shepard took out a thresher maw
[4:02:22] <+Havictos> They're slaughtering everyone Liara fuck
[4:02:23] <Goraka91> Oh no, her poor people, woe is them
[4:02:23] <%DrTomT18> @DrTomT18 true. But I imagine that Asari will edit little details to make themselves out to be the heroes, and not the direct cause of all the bad shit that happens between now and the final mission
[4:02:24] <Marpolo13> meanwhile, on earth
[4:02:25] <jorniev> i wish you could help
[4:02:25] <%DoubleRrico> they were playing on hard
[4:02:26] <Realimpact> you actually can
[4:02:26] <%Dakuu75> Why do the Reapers like dragons so much? (I'm not criticizing jsut wondering.)
[4:02:27] <%RealThiele> garrus could
[4:02:27] <ZippierJosh> good try
[4:02:28] <Thepothero> Revenant is a beast
[4:02:30] <alrobot2014> unfortunately they're not garrus
[4:02:31] <%stantheman_97> it was 3, come on now
[4:02:31] <Kobi_Robi_Tobi> Garrus killed one in 10 seconds flat
[4:02:32] <%Conscript_Gary> To be fair to Liara she's like 20 by her race's standards
[4:02:32] <%afronooch> lets let him get to stuff before we start talkin about it
[4:02:32] <%DianaTheAscian> maybe they should have been fighting on easy mode
[4:02:33] <mikeriffic> yea they arent playing on narritive like us"
[4:02:35] <Treasure_Vault> This should have happened halfway through your visit to Thessia
[4:02:37] <@QueequegTheater> @Dakuu75 They're dope as fuck
[4:02:38] <%InternetShis> Green biotics cool
[4:02:43] <mr_sups> Doesn't Morinith Show up here if you chose her?
[4:02:45] <Treasure_Vault> They invade while you're visiting on vacation
[4:02:46] <cpt_langosta> narrative is the new normal
[4:02:47] <ZippierJosh> there was an attempt
[4:02:47] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> They are on real life mode Liara
[4:02:53] <peachy996> Nah not here
[4:02:54] <%blue8moon> it's a little dumb Liara is like "My people are dying" when you star the game with the reapers nuking earth
[4:02:54] <kikoeru_san> so is Pat using a rifle because it's super good or like, why no shotgun
[4:02:56] <olaksi> it's not like she saw earth first hand either
[4:02:58] <knight_verse> Jeeze, Pat isn't even trying anymore, they just lay down and die by themselves.
[4:02:59] <%InternetShis> "I'm baby"
[4:03:01] <%DrTomT18> @mr_sups No, I think she shows up on the battle for Earth
[4:03:01] <%TheWinged7> not even paige?
[4:03:02] <%AmericanSkidd> Gee Liara, did you just figure out a war has been happening?
[4:03:03] <jorniev> no music?
[4:03:08] <@QueequegTheater> Marauder Shields nagU
[4:03:08] <+cunningchaff> oh, please get killed by the banshee
[4:03:09] <%maskedsongbird> Oh man, Biotic charge continues to be the best
[4:03:13] <Sp3ctre48> Please don't get insta killed on narrative
[4:03:15] <%DoubleRrico> everyone else is getting wrecked because they're playing on hard
[4:03:16] <%YakumoYomi> Are we still doing "Baby Mode out of spite"? Because I'm all for it.
[4:03:17] <ohno778> lol this build is busted
[4:03:19] <d3ltuhhh> i thought this part had music wtf
[4:03:21] <BurdRightsActivist> REEE
[4:03:22] <AthenaAegis> BOOBA ARCHVILE WutFace
[4:03:29] <ZippierJosh> Liara remember earth..??
[4:03:30] <%DrTomT18> @AmericanSkidd yes, but only unimportant aliens were dying, not the beautiful Asari
[4:03:30] <DSD24> Morinth was here
[4:03:33] <%NeoCre> @kikoeru_san it’s a heavy machinegun that feels good to shoot
[4:03:35] <%Monkeyweed21> do we have enough soundbites to convince Woolie that Pat has some weird fetish yet?
[4:03:38] <peachy996> maybe the music got bored of your babymode and left
[4:03:40] <Realimpact> why
[4:03:40] <ohno778> oh
[4:03:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just use Spotify to put on some Halo music LUL
[4:03:42] <%maskedsongbird> Out of spite?
[4:03:43] <%aWanderingKaivo> chat spite?
[4:03:44] <%Taisuru> LUL
[4:03:44] <DSD24> The Spitethrough
[4:03:46] <%TheWinged7> now you know Pat, Spite > mind goblins
[4:03:47] <peyodogo> "spite"
[4:03:47] <peachy996> good riddance
[4:03:50] <Realimpact> get in line Liara
[4:03:50] <Sp3ctre48> "Not my people" BabyRage
[4:03:51] <%Conscript_Gary> Liara we have been fighting human husks for THREE YEARS NOW
[4:03:52] <%LumberjackJack> This part is where you can start EASILY seeing the horribly rushed development. Much more than before
[4:03:53] <%blue8moon> Liara you've been fighing human husks for years
[4:03:53] <%cooldude69xx> I bet that bad father will totally see this
[4:03:54] <BlindGato> I was sorta hoping for the banshee to dunk on Pat, but oh well
[4:03:55] <%DashXero> LUL
[4:03:58] <%topendbuzza> beandad 2
[4:03:58] <%dekkitout> Fuck dem keedz
[4:03:59] <kikoeru_san> that's raw Javik
[4:03:59] <James_Quivers> Javik said FUCK THEM KIDS
[4:04:00] <blackjack8182> SPITE
[4:04:01] <GuyNamedGatsby> Ahh journalist mode
[4:04:01] <@Spydurman> wow Pat, what about the challenge and life lessons they teach us?
[4:04:01] <notsoy> SHOOT THE BABY
[4:04:01] <stranger59> To spit in the face of Roblox Dad
[4:04:02] <+Havictos> Is there supposed to be music here or it supposed to be like this
[4:04:04] <%PunchSlugfest> That such a good exchange
[4:04:05] <%DrTomT18> Can you blame him?
[4:04:05] <%The_Protagonist> oh no chat doesn't know about the article
[4:04:05] <%mads_valentine> Bust a cap in those kids
[4:04:06] <%xerioes> fuck the kids
[4:04:07] <%DashXero> "Fuck them kids." - Javik
[4:04:12] <%kujofire990> FUCK THEM KIDS
[4:04:12] <d3ltuhhh> javik the sigma male
[4:04:12] <%ape_hawk> javik punted all those baby prothean reapers into the stratosphere
[4:04:13] <%RealThiele> he got the child murder high score
[4:04:18] <ohno778> Dumped all skill points into spite
[4:04:18] <%maskedsongbird> I admit that it's been a while since I've been privvy to these streams due to life stuff. What's the story behind the Narrative spite thing?
[4:04:19] <d3ltuhhh> LUL
[4:04:23] <Treasure_Vault> Mass Effect combat ain't teaching you anything important
[4:04:23] <dd44dostivei> keyser soze those babies
[4:04:23] <%Cozy90> you gotta kill the kids to save the children
[4:04:23] <%cooldude69xx> This mission makes Liara out to be an asshole
[4:04:24] <%InternetShis> No, spite against some dickhead who hates that their 8 year old child played Miles Morales on easy
[4:04:24] <%toolofparanoia> i missed something on stream on on twitter that caused this... why are you playing on narrative mode?
[4:04:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Is that a big one?
[4:04:26] <kikoeru_san> "Fuck them kids" - Javik at some point probably
[4:04:26] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[4:04:27] <Sp3ctre48> I'm pretty sure there's just no music during this part for the emoshuns
[4:04:28] <%Ancopro> javik would throw his kid into a volcano
[4:04:30] <stranger59> If you survived 2020, you can play games as easy as you want to.
[4:04:30] <%Conscript_Gary> BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
[4:04:30] <%YakumoYomi> Banshees still give me nightmares from MP on Gold and up
[4:04:31] <%hrbeck_> We’ll grow more and they will be strong enough to kill us
[4:04:32] <%Deft_Thought> Did they changed their minds because the Reapers clipped through a building
[4:04:38] <%DashXero> "We can make more."
[4:04:39] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat so beeg
[4:04:39] <%hat_under_bread> Just fell over from how cool you are.
[4:04:41] <peachy996> Challenge in videogames should not be forced it should be chosen
[4:04:41] <%Cozy90> BWAAAAAh
[4:04:41] <lloyddboy> wow rip
[4:04:43] <peachy996> Duh
[4:04:49] <%InternetShis> BEEG SNIPER
[4:04:49] <%Dakuu75> @maskedsongbird Some random dip shit on twitter was pissed his kids were playing games on easy-mode
[4:04:50] <%topendbuzza> you would be fuck if you got life lessons from viya games
[4:04:52] <@QueequegTheater> That one is playing dead
[4:04:53] <Realimpact> i don't remember sovereign making those sounds
[4:04:53] <tanarath> big boi
[4:04:56] <SaltyAzteca> THE WIDOW
[4:04:56] <Treasure_Vault> Pat having way more fun on narrative. It's nice.
[4:04:56] <jorniev> THATS ONE BIG GUY
[4:04:58] <Jmann1892> Widow is the best Sniper Rifle
[4:05:01] <fusedforms> NO
[4:05:01] <%Taisuru> FUCKING WIDOW 98
[4:05:01] <%DoubleRrico> please tell me this ends with Liara becoming a sith
[4:05:03] <%Axellogic> strongest sniperoni
[4:05:06] <James_Quivers> This specific battle? No lol
[4:05:06] <@QueequegTheater> WIDOW nagU
[4:05:07] <@Ranryu692> Some guy wrote an article about how he resents his kid for playing Spider-Man on easy
[4:05:13] <%hrbeck_> Why spite?
[4:05:17] <%Mekhet09> Mekhet09 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Do lore/fluff and gameplay differences ever bother you. In mass effect, jack should be doing like 5x the damage of everyone else but doesn't because of balance reasons. Why have a character like that if you don't show it.
[4:05:25] <%maskedsongbird> @maskedsongbird Oh fuck that's so stupid. But not much of a surprise I guess.
[4:05:25] <+samiscoolbro> Gbh this isnt much different from normal mode
[4:05:26] <d3ltuhhh> oh my god kaboom
[4:05:30] <peachy996> Maybe his kid is just an asshole
[4:05:31] <%DrTomT18> @DoubleRrico My theory is that the Asari will be one of the villains for Mass Effect 4
[4:05:38] <peachy996> Like his dad
[4:05:44] <%YakumoYomi> I mean...steamrolling enemies is why I love min-maxing and playing Musou games
[4:05:45] <Sp3ctre48> Bioware would never
[4:05:48] <cpt_langosta> GOD. RAYS.
[4:05:49] <@QueequegTheater> @hrbeck_ Journalist wrote about how he was disappointed in his 8 year old son for playing Miles Morales on easy mode
[4:05:51] <%DoubleRrico> cool!
[4:05:53] <%Taisuru> @Ranryu692 That can't be real, surely you didn't realize it was a hard drive article or something
[4:05:57] <%DrTomT18> OH IT GETS WORSE
[4:06:00] <%DianaTheAscian> Yeah
[4:06:01] <blackjack8182> Cry harder Liara
[4:06:01] <%AmericanSkidd> Yeah, its fucked up
[4:06:02] <James_Quivers> Asari being Asari
[4:06:02] <%Dakuu75> I know eh
[4:06:03] <kikoeru_san> man look at these stacked hydroponics
[4:06:04] <olm46> But it's MY planet!
[4:06:06] <peachy996> Palaven is ON FIRE
[4:06:06] <%JamesCorck> it's been longer than that.
[4:06:08] <%Dakuu75> OWNED
[4:06:08] <%ape_hawk> actually, months plural
[4:06:10] <%topendbuzza> if the kid is an asshole it's because dad made him one
[4:06:11] <+Havictos> @Dakuu75 I actually can't comprehend why anyone cares what difficulty people play on. So I want to play easy fuck off
[4:06:11] <Profmcstevie> Galactic war sure, but MY planet?!
[4:06:11] <kikoeru_san> She ded
[4:06:12] <%JamesCorck> More like 3 months.
[4:06:12] <Realimpact> Asari privilege
[4:06:13] <d3ltuhhh> earth, palaven, and a bunch of other planets getting annihilated
[4:06:14] <@QueequegTheater> @Taisuru It was on Escapist, it's real
[4:06:17] <Realimpact> straight up
[4:06:17] <peachy996> You can SEE Palaven burning from its MOON!!!
[4:06:19] <cpt_langosta> i've always liked this asari's voice for some reason
[4:06:20] <%DrTomT18> HALF OF PALAVAN IS ON FIRE
[4:06:21] <haisho> but see it's not THEIR planet now is it?
[4:06:22] <%JamesCorck> The asari as a culture are horrible people.
[4:06:22] <%Jeemukun> I hate this part so much cause I couldn't give one rat's ass about the asari
[4:06:22] <Sp3ctre48> but it matters now because the Asari are being attacked
[4:06:23] <d3ltuhhh> thessia gets hit: oh my GOD!
[4:06:24] <%Deft_Thought> Yeah but Earthlings are a joke, not an established ancient species of space faring space psychics
[4:06:25] <Minorou> Reapers, in MY planet?
[4:06:26] <%The_Protagonist> @Taisuru no it wasn't a satire article. People thought it was at first and then realized it wasn't.
[4:06:26] <%Conscript_Gary> Part of being a space elf includes being self-centered
[4:06:26] <@Ranryu692> @Ranryu692 I haven't read it myself, that's just more or less what Pat explained earlier
[4:06:29] <%hrbeck_> @queequegtheater 💯
[4:06:31] <%ahomeschooldropout> Everything after this mission is where the writing starts completely shitting itself
[4:06:32] <ZippierJosh> Liara pls
[4:06:33] <%JamesCorck> Individual Asari are good, as a culture they're insufferable.
[4:06:34] <%maskedsongbird> @QueequegTheater Oh, THAT story!? I just read that on the Escapist today. That was so dumb.
[4:06:37] <peachy996> oh the music is back
[4:06:48] <@QueequegTheater> THERE IS A FUCKING STATE-SIZED FIRE ON PALAVEN THAT YOU CAN SEE FROM SPACE, LIARA
[4:06:49] <%topendbuzza> they won't attack us we have the blue tittys
[4:06:49] <Sp3ctre48> Paragon Shepard is such a bastard in this part
[4:06:53] <%dekkitout> You hate it? Wha- Wild...
[4:06:54] <+cunningchaff> shepard, you don't need their help
[4:06:55] <ohno778> WRITING
[4:06:55] <%tusk102> you loved the war before they attacked your home
[4:06:56] <%AncelDeLambert> god I hate the Asari homeworld
[4:06:59] <%GuilKato> pat you could have done it without the gunship
[4:07:02] <%Deft_Thought> DIE FOR THIS HUMAN
[4:07:03] <%Taisuru> @The_Protagonist I hate it so much, if the kid is having fun who gives a fuck what difficulty it is
[4:07:08] <peyodogo> bailey to bailey dialogue
[4:07:10] <notsoy> is this Laura Bailey talking to herself in three degrees?
[4:07:11] <tanarath> Asari keep together for a millenia by disassociation
[4:07:12] <RushUnplugged> remember guys, delete roblox from your kids' computers, because creativity is useless, only CHALLENGE exists
[4:07:15] <%AncelDeLambert> RIGHT?!
[4:07:15] <Brofarian> not a huge fan of this war to be honest
[4:07:19] <Treasure_Vault> Yeah, that's weak
[4:07:20] <+xerotwo> ILLUSION OF CHOICE Kappa
[4:07:21] <%Cozy90> red leader here
[4:07:22] <%Mekhet09> Yeah there's a reason people don't like ME3.
[4:07:26] <%walternatorz> yeah, that really pissed me off
[4:07:26] <peachy996> How hard would it have been to remove the rachni parts
[4:07:26] <%Mekhet09> There's like no choice.
[4:07:30] <%sporeian94> probably ran out of time to program another option
[4:07:31] <James_Quivers> They got a hold of some
[4:07:31] <@Ranryu692> gotta have more enemy types
[4:07:33] <kikoeru_san> all of the Baileys
[4:07:33] <peachy996> if you killed him
[4:07:34] <%Mekhet09> Things don't matter.
[4:07:35] <%MightyDuckShoes> YEEAAAHH Rachni! Nothing Matters!
[4:07:35] <Sp3ctre48> I love the part where they just clone another Queen if you killed the one in ME1
[4:07:35] <@Spydurman> to be fair all races are
[4:07:38] <%ahomeschooldropout> Imagine if you killed the Rachni in 1 and those enemies never showed up in 3
[4:07:39] <$hattrick61> I mean turians and batarians and humans are enemies no matter what
[4:07:40] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt theres like 3 times the amount of them if you don't save them i think?
[4:07:43] <%AmericanSkidd> THATS A SHOTGUN YOU BITCH
[4:07:44] <Kat_k> there's a lot more of those moments if you had a lot of deaths in 2
[4:07:45] <%maskedsongbird> Yeah, ME3 really ruined the Rachni subplot...
[4:07:46] <%AncelDeLambert> The Rachni horseshit was the start of me hating this game, I could not BELIEVE they got fucked over and we had to re-choose the choice from the first game, what was the point
[4:07:49] <T_Sasquatch> @taisuru looks like someone is going to raise a fucking causal
[4:07:51] <%Conscript_Gary> To be fair to the devs, balancing the whole game with an enemy type completely absent would be wild
[4:07:52] <jorniev> MORINTH SHOWS UP HERE I THINK
[4:07:53] <peachy996> Beefy Girl
[4:07:55] <Brandon__Brando> like all you had to do was make it so you just skip a mission
[4:07:55] <1faber> shepard's about to walk menacingly at them
[4:08:00] <peachy996> Good for that Banshee!
[4:08:01] <%DianaTheAscian> @AmericanSkidd LUL LUL LUL
[4:08:02] <%tusk102> @ahomeschooldropout nah the reapers clone the queen if you dont save them
[4:08:04] <%The_Protagonist> Banshees are wild
[4:08:05] <%AncelDeLambert> like, I already MADE this choice, Bioware, why am I making it again?
[4:08:07] <fusedforms> WOW FUCK YOU
[4:08:08] <Goraka91> How about you fucking help first
[4:08:11] <Realimpact> FUCK OFF LIARA
[4:08:11] <%afronooch> too soon for morinth
[4:08:11] <SaltyAzteca> Almost bumped the difficulty to easy mode
[4:08:13] <kikoeru_san> this bitch is really right now
[4:08:14] <ohno778> shut up liara
[4:08:15] <%Monkeyweed21> @jorniev Morinth shows up in London i thought
[4:08:18] <AngryAsian5> The Alliance is kind of busy right now Liara LUL
[4:08:19] <%YakumoYomi> Banshees are still pretty beefy on Narrative, eh?
[4:08:21] <%The_Protagonist> I remember having to fight a wave of Banshees in the multiplayer, that shit was crazy
[4:08:25] <%DrTomT18> PLEASE THING ABOUT WHAT LIARA JUST SAID
[4:08:26] <%maskedsongbird> I'm in the minority that likes ME3 even with the lackluster ending, but man that Rachni thing really does bring it down for me.
[4:08:26] <hassanico2> Oh hell yeah he took Javik here
[4:08:28] <Profmcstevie> Liara I will slap you with my dick but not in the way you want if you don't shuddup
[4:08:28] <%toolofparanoia> missed an upgrade
[4:08:29] <hassanico2> I love his dialogue
[4:08:30] <+xerotwo> Hey, Spore Cameo Kappa
[4:08:32] <%Archphronimos> there was an item on the ground
[4:08:37] <%InternetShis> Liara fuck your planet how bout that
[4:08:38] <jorniev> @Monkeyweed21 oh was it? i dont remember
[4:08:39] <alrobot2014> @Monkeyweed21 yeah that's right in the initial part of that mission
[4:08:40] <ZippierJosh> Liara wtf
[4:08:41] <%DashXero> I'm guessing the Pilot knows of a good bar.
[4:08:45] <Silent_Fyraena> Devil's advocate, but you can sorta understand not wanting to make an entire enemy force 'missable' based on decisions from an entirely different game. As cool as that would be, IMO.
[4:08:47] <%Dakuu75> why does the Prothean guy even stay? He seems to think he's better than everyone
[4:08:50] <jorniev> MIIIIIKE
[4:08:51] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Shockwave must be busted now
[4:08:52] <Sp3ctre48> The ending is only one of the problems with ME3 for me
[4:08:56] <%DrTomT18> "Maybe next time some HUMANS can die in place of Asari?"
[4:08:56] <%maskedsongbird> See, Liara's insufferable bullshit is yet another reason why Tali is Best Girl
[4:09:01] <%tusk102> JESUS
[4:09:06] <ohno778> Prothean haet reaper
[4:09:06] <d3ltuhhh> you can literally walk through harvester bursts on narrative
[4:09:12] <d3ltuhhh> but on ANYTHING ELSE you get 2 hit by them
[4:09:14] <d3ltuhhh> LUL
[4:09:18] <%tusk102> i knew this mode was easier than easy but christ
[4:09:18] <@QueequegTheater> God the Revenant fucking FUCKS
[4:09:19] <Brandon__Brando> and it cant hurt you
[4:09:19] <%afronooch> this part sucks on insanity too
[4:09:19] <kikoeru_san> this is fucking hilarious

[4:09:23] <BigFingerRo> THIS IS THE POWER OF BABY MODE
[4:09:30] <Goraka91> What a shame
[4:09:31] <%AmericanSkidd> they just leave
[4:09:33] <%DianaTheAscian> its a shame that humans just become the lowest tier units for the reapers
[4:09:34] <HeroToxiko> chest high walls bb
[4:09:36] <d3ltuhhh> OH MY SHIELDS!
[4:09:38] <peachy996> You'll learn
[4:09:42] <Profmcstevie> THE DIAPER HOLDS FIRM
[4:09:43] <%Conscript_Gary> Considering this is where the story starts to fall apart, baby mode is appropriate
[4:09:43] <blackjack8182> Behold Baby Power
[4:09:44] <+OneGorillionDollars> @PatStaresAt as much as I believe Javik and Liara are mandatory for this mission, bringing garrus is hilarious to see him mow down all those harvesters

[4:10:16] <%Mekhet09> I think the devs have the choice to do it and it's fine that it's there.
[4:10:17] <%DrTomT18> Pat, you gotta look at all the artifacts in here

[4:10:19] <digaogrunge> good
[4:10:19] <%AncelDeLambert> this shit has reached criticality, put everything on easy mode, fuck it
[4:10:20] <%KineticZen> I think it matters if the difficulty is stupid and spongy like ME's has always been or actually mechanically challenging
[4:10:20] <Treasure_Vault> Someone was so wrong he turned your brain right
[4:10:20] <stranger59> My friends are my easy mode!

[4:28:29] <Botman_R> If you killed Gades in Lufia, you got his sword!
[4:28:31] <%ape_hawk> have the reapers helping kai leng
[4:28:33] <%greasypete00> kai leng brings in two gunships
[4:28:33] <%kyh9> THIS GAME PRETENDING LIKE KAI LENG WON FAIRLY IS BULLSHIT
[4:28:33] <%AmericanSkidd> the fight may as well not exist, just stich the scenes together
[4:28:35] <BurdRightsActivist> Damn, I've been defeated! But I won't fall here, I must make my retreat!
[4:28:38] <%Monkeyweed21> every Tales game has that
[4:28:40] <Treasure_Vault> Just send in like 100 cerb dudes
[4:28:41] <vile_brand> give kai lang a scar on his face
[4:28:42] <@QueequegTheater> HAVE HIM HACK YOUR GEAR
[4:28:48] <stranger59> Yeah, the concept some guy can just punk you this far into the series is nuts.
[4:28:49] <%LumberjackJack> He should've desperately called in the gunship, bloody and all, when you win the fight
[4:28:50] <%cvp5127> he cries and shits himself
[4:28:50] <kikoeru_san> Gen-chan can get fucked with that dagger throwing asshole
[4:28:51] <$Futurecity10> This is a western game, dev's arent that smart
[4:28:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you have to win the fight and its stupid easy on EVERY difficulty
[4:28:58] <peachy996> You are on the easiest difficulty with a health melting gun. And you just couldn't do it
[4:29:01] <ThatGuyThere03> why the fuck can't anybody do a Vergil right?
[4:29:01] <hassanico2> 3 gunships, to make it balanced
[4:29:01] <Meekest> Yeah the fact the gunship is there the whole time really makes him seem dumber
[4:29:03] <%sunsetdisc0> javik spent his entire life fighting yet all it took was having a 110 pound blue lady thrown at him to take him down
[4:29:03] <+cermo55> or just endless cerberus waves
[4:29:06] <James_Quivers> This was fairly average for the type of 'you didn't win' cutscene fight for the era tho, tbh
[4:29:08] <@goose_attack_almanac> No no . You saw the mechanics
[4:29:09] <Brandon__Brando> this is completely changes the plot
[4:29:09] <cpt_langosta> bad on any difficulty
[4:29:10] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt Franz had a similar complaint about Ghost of Sushima
[4:29:10] <peachy996> His health never even took a bit of damage
[4:29:12] <lloyddboy> IT SUCKS ON HARDCORE TOO
[4:29:13] <hassanico2> IT's the same on all difficulties
[4:29:13] <%InternetShis> He just fucking dies the end we win
[4:29:14] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt It's the easiest boss fight in the game even on Insanity
[4:29:15] <%kyh9> It is NOT a hard boss fight
[4:29:17] <blackjack8182> It’s easy on every difficulty
[4:29:18] <T_Sasquatch> But that would require effort
[4:29:19] <%afronooch> its new to the fight yeah
[4:29:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> The old "I didn't lose if you didn't win"
[4:29:19] <Jmann1892> He cheated the whole fight, loses and then the game says no YOU LOST
[4:29:19] <%AncelDeLambert> He should be knocked on his ass, and then the gunship shows up to save his worthless ass with a spray of gunfire, yeah
[4:29:19] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the fights mechanics dont change
[4:29:20] <+spartanghost004> oh it is still pretty bad
[4:29:20] <%sporeian94> spoiler alert: the fight sucks at even the hardest difficulty
[4:29:21] <Jaysky> Nope that was the fight
[4:29:22] <%kyh9> He never fully loses shields
[4:29:22] <alrobot2014> even on harder difficulties its trash
[4:29:22] <%LumberjackJack> I played this on insane. I can confirm that fight is super fucking easy
[4:29:23] <Kat_k> Fun fact also, if you bring the wrong bonus power to that fight with kai leng, you can soft lock the game.
[4:29:23] <+TrevSmith222> Kai really does feel like he's from a different series.
[4:29:25] <%tank7013> It's so you can't hurt him because he's too cool and strong
[4:29:25] <ShiningAxis> even outside of baby the fight is really easy
[4:29:26] <%Monkeyweed21> ITS EASY ON EVERY DIFFICULTY
[4:29:27] <%kyh9> Its a BULLSHIT fight
[4:29:28] <%InternetShis> IF GARRUS WERE THERE
[4:29:29] <@commanderclaw> He needs to DBZ charge his shields
[4:29:30] <BurdRightsActivist> STOP PRETENDING KAI "BIG DICK" LENG WOULDN'T WIN
[4:29:30] <djblue_shift> nah man this boss fight was super easy on insanity
[4:29:35] <+idyota> They literally did it in the arrival dlc in me2
[4:29:35] <Sp3ctre48> It's not even a boss, he's just a super phantom
[4:29:37] <%cvp5127> HES SO COOL THO
[4:29:38] <djblue_shift> one of the easiest fights
[4:29:39] <%sporeian94> Mac Walters and Casey Hudson
[4:29:42] <+holyxgrale> yeah I think what's most infuriating, is that they could have done this so much better
[4:29:43] <%JoshManVGH> @queequegtheater That's a good one. Could also pump in some Anti-Biotic gas or some shit.
[4:29:44] <@commanderclaw> They're trying to Roman Reigns him
[4:29:45] <olaksi> PLEASE THINK HE'S COOL
[4:29:46] <kikoeru_san> It was so easy that it makes everyone pissed that Thessia still falls
[4:29:47] <peachy996> Babymode perfectly captures the awful mechanics of that fight
[4:29:48] <Treasure_Vault> My OC is cool guys, seriously.
[4:29:50] <+Mrbaconator> he's just like oh so cool tho
[4:29:52] <%InternetShis> OH SEE DONUT STEELE
[4:29:52] <%LumberjackJack> "Isn't this antithesis of Shepard so fucking strong?"
[4:29:53] <stranger59> PUSH KAI LENG FOR SUMMERSLAM!
[4:29:53] <terrible35> desparate for validation'
[4:29:59] <+cermo55> no, he just makes everyone else look worse
[4:30:01] <%DracosMagala> How did Javik lose???
[4:30:01] <Treasure_Vault> Why doesn't anyone believe that my OC is the coolest?
[4:30:01] <%GabeSweetMan> He's the (pre-heel) Roman Reigns of Mass Effect.
[4:30:01] <%Varlinator> He's so emo & lame it's ridiculous
[4:30:03] <%robotoken> push Kai Lang for Wrestlemania
[4:30:05] <%dekkitout> Is he supposed to have a heel0face turn later? Is that why he's shoved in your face?
[4:30:07] <%maskedsongbird> So much of Kai Leng's stuff feels completely out of place even in the context of the Mass Effect universe, I really don't see the point of him.
[4:30:07] <fusedforms> Donut Steel kek
[4:30:09] <Sp3ctre48> I like when he just threw Liara at Javik and then they both died I guess
[4:30:09] <+ReallyBigRocks> not to mention that the animation just looks bad
[4:30:12] <sun312772> In sekiro when you face the fist boss again his bow is broken as i remember
[4:30:16] <ZippierJosh> My oc tho
[4:30:17] <Profmcstevie> 3 on 1
[4:30:18] <santafer> He is Lucky Wrex is not a teammate
[4:30:18] <%afronooch> Yep
[4:30:19] <Jaysky> PUNCH
[4:30:21] <%LumberjackJack> He literally tosses Garrus with the same ease, too
[4:30:21] <%JamesCorck> Kai Leng is the worst thing about Mass Effect, period.
[4:30:21] <%cvp5127> swordless
[4:30:23] <%YakumoYomi> I love that Liara and Shepard look like their listening intently to Pat
[4:30:23] <kikoeru_san> and throws them into another
[4:30:24] <%hairtoday> he brushes them aside
[4:30:24] <+Soliloquy123> You can tell they also just wanted to write a really sad scene of Shepard 'losing' and everyone being sad
[4:30:27] <%Conscript_Gary> Imagine if he had thrown Liara at James
[4:30:28] <@Ranryu692> they got Worfed
[4:30:28] <SaltyAzteca> His dick is sooooo biiiiiiiiiiiiig
[4:30:29] <@goose_attack_almanac> Not to mention both are extremely powerful biotics
[4:30:29] <Jaysky> "Now it's fun"
[4:30:30] <alrobot2014> luckily for them they don't even give you a krogan
[4:30:30] <scrumbotime> HE'S SO STRONG THOUGH
[4:30:32] <stranger59> He puts his sword DOWN
[4:30:32] <%stantheman_97> i forgot how bad this is
[4:30:33] <%AmericanSkidd> like they dont exist
[4:30:33] <%kyh9> It's total bullshit
[4:30:33] <%greasypete00> the dumbest fucking thing
[4:30:33] <%JamesCorck> The ending is nothing compared to how bad he is of a character.
[4:30:35] <%Conscript_Gary> that slab wouldn't have fucking flinched
[4:30:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's just so cool tho
[4:30:36] <%Fooguwu> "NOW IT'S FUN"
[4:30:37] <%LumberjackJack> At* Garrus
[4:30:37] <kikoeru_san> just *toss*
[4:30:37] <@commanderclaw> Imagine if you had Garrus on your team
[4:30:38] <%RaziWraith> Makes your teammates look like jobbers LUL
[4:30:41] <%MightyDuckShoes> Imagine if you had Vega and Edi in your party.
[4:30:41] <@Spydurman> he's SOOO STRONG
[4:30:42] <MidnightPacif1c> fanfic powers go
[4:30:42] <%shootbang_exe> no please like our very cool and badass character
[4:30:42] <Kat_k> i mean, shadow broker did that too and it was fine
[4:30:43] <Explodincatz> A N I M E
[4:30:43] <+Extrallent> like what if that had been EDI
[4:30:45] <$StrawberryPantsu> No Pat he just got super strong
[4:30:47] <mr_saturday93> cutscene incompetence in a nutshell
[4:30:48] <santafer> The power of Cerberus and Anime is on his side
[4:30:50] <Brandon__Brando> Its so stupid its fucking funny
[4:30:52] <blackjack8182> He is stronger without the sword! Isn’t that cool pat!
[4:30:52] <%JamesCorck> No it's not nit picky, Pat!
[4:30:56] <%JamesCorck> This isn't nitpick.
[4:30:58] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Imagine if your team was James and Javik, how fucking absurd it would be
[4:30:59] <lloyddboy> Kai Leng has advanced Reaper tech known as a "Clown Field"
[4:31:01] <+spartanghost004> he is an anime character
[4:31:07] <%InternetShis> Nothing falls down
[4:31:09] <+cermo55> 4 biotics and he's the only one who uses his powers
[4:31:09] <%JamesCorck> You're right! Which holyshit for anyone to say that!
[4:31:10] <kingra> LUL
[4:31:10] <%tusk102> YEAH
[4:31:11] <%Deadpal> this isn't nitpicky.
[4:31:12] <peachy996> ye
[4:31:13] <%Deadpal> this is logcial.
[4:31:13] <%maskedsongbird> @Soliloquy123 The fucked up part of that is that such a scene is perfectly fine, if they had just put more than a modicum of thought into why such a scene would exist.
[4:31:14] <%tusk102> IT WOULD HAVE
[4:31:14] <%afronooch> not nitpicky at all legitimate criticism
[4:31:15] <1faber> hahaha
[4:31:15] <%demiiluna> In the books they explain this by telling you that Kai Leng has a 40 inch penis and that's why he's so powerful so it's justified.
[4:31:17] <%AmericanSkidd> yeah it makes no sense
[4:31:18] <%Xevtes> haha
[4:31:19] <%Fooguwu> floors are below falling ceilings
[4:31:19] <Sp3ctre48> no the bottom of the temple was hollow I guess
[4:31:20] <Jaysky> BE QUIET PAT, STOP.
[4:31:22] <%Deadpal> YEP.
[4:31:24] <Jaysky> HE'S COOL
[4:31:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> reverse load bearing walls
[4:31:26] <+miguelrod777> shut up pat LUL
[4:31:26] <olaksi> oh that wacky asari architecture
[4:31:26] <d3ltuhhh> could you imagine if ME3 had one of the krogan squadmates for thessia and liara got thrown at them LUL
[4:31:27] <%kyh9> Nothing about that fight makes sense
[4:31:29] <%4DLuvOfLuthy> shhh with your logic pat!
[4:31:29] <%Monkeyweed21> Troy Baker HATES Kai Leng btw
[4:31:29] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[4:31:31] <ZippierJosh> Yes
[4:31:31] <%faldin> why is the floor hollow anyways????
[4:31:31] <%charp35> Man I forgot how stupid that scene was
[4:31:32] <haisho> OH NO LOGIC
[4:31:34] <@QueequegTheater> BUT HIS DICK WAS SO BIG
[4:31:34] <RLT917> atpCap
[4:31:35] <santafer> so cool
[4:31:35] <Sp3ctre48> It was just a bottomless pit LUL
[4:31:35] <%LumberjackJack> Also implying there are death pits below the floor, not more ground
[4:31:35] <%Taisuru> SINCE WHEN WERE YOU A MASTER OF ASARI ACHITECTURE PAT
[4:31:37] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt this isnt nitpick this is literally basic logic dont worry
[4:31:42] <kikoeru_san> literally my least favorite part of the game, Liara was the homie in my playthrough
[4:31:42] <@Spydurman> why is it BUILT ON A PIT???
[4:31:43] <KingSpunf> it cause he cool and street
[4:31:44] <%polothegreatest> He fikng Kiryu you so bad
[4:31:46] <scrumbotime> Kai Leng's Huge Vaccine Balls kept him still
[4:31:46] <kingra> HE'S SO COOL THO SHUT UP
[4:31:48] <Jaysky> LOOK AT HIS MASSIVE SWORD
[4:31:49] <%kyh9> BECAUSE HES SO COOL
[4:31:49] <%GabeSweetMan> He has a load-bearing dick.
[4:31:49] <%Aeoneth> It's Alien architecture Pat YoU DoN't KNoW ThAt
[4:31:50] <BurdRightsActivist> BED OF CHAOS FIGHT LUL 4Head
[4:31:50] <James_Quivers> BIG DICK ENERGY
[4:31:51] <cpt_langosta> but pat, asari architecture works backwards: pillars hold the floor in place while the foundation supports the roof
[4:31:53] <SaltyAzteca> Kai Leng seems to be immune to logic, almost as if he exists in his own world by his own rules.
[4:31:54] <%greasypete00> i cant wait to hear this again on the podcast for like 30 minutes
[4:31:54] <+RoByte2> So if he was MGS Fortune it'd be cool then?
[4:31:55] <@QueequegTheater> I HATE IT ALL SO MUCH
[4:31:55] <@goose_attack_almanac> He walked up to a biotic and slapped them.
[4:31:55] <jorniev> MARY SUE
[4:31:56] <%kyh9> BECAUSE HES COLDSTEEL THE KAILENG
[4:31:56] <@commanderclaw> He's a Naruto OC
[4:31:56] <%walternatorz> he's that cool
[4:31:56] <+JustToWatch> KAI LENG DOESN'T AFRAID OF ANYTHING
[4:31:56] <xbb1024> Hello! who are we talking about?
[4:31:57] <DXLelouch24> @monkeyweed21 so this ones just a paycheck
[4:31:57] <@QueequegTheater> AHHHHH
[4:31:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> also sheperd just ran in a circle while the floor collapsed under him
[4:31:57] <dd44dostivei> he feels like a mod
[4:31:58] <peachy996> So below this temple floor is a black void of nothing
[4:31:59] <+D00msDayDan> mass effect fields in his hair to stop it from blowing around
[4:31:59] <Dabrikishaw> AND Kai Leng was orginally going to permkill a squadmate
[4:32:00] <%sporeian94> Pat, in the original sequence in the first draft. That mission involved Liara and the virmire surivor and you would have to choose to save one from the crumbling building while the other died
[4:32:01] <RushUnplugged> but he's got a SPACE KAYTANA
[4:32:01] <%Agami23> its like they should have made the floor metal and establish he had magnet boots or something
[4:32:01] <%The_Protagonist> no but he's so cool tho
[4:32:02] <AngryAsian5> SIGMA ENERGY
[4:32:02] <%dekkitout> You lost me at hair, but he is obtusely present
[4:32:03] <vonmaultke> like a shit Tom bombadil
[4:32:03] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY IS THE TEMPLE THE BED OF CHAOS ARENA
[4:32:05] <Holofono> but he's so cool tho
[4:32:06] <%InternetShis> snuffExcilant
[4:32:07] <%AmericanSkidd> its bad all around
[4:32:10] <terrible35> OC Donut Steel
[4:32:12] <+ALazo> you don't get it pat he's just too cool for you
[4:32:14] <%xcompleasedad> xcompleasedad subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months, currently on a 2 month streak! So, unfortunately, you missed out on all of the Lore in that section, which was the main reason why you would bring Javik on that mission. If you can, go back there on your own time. It's REALLY good.
[4:32:14] <%AmuserName> @PatStaresAt For what it's worth, the game punishes you for not picking ALL PARAGON / ALL RENEGADE for your Illusive Man conversation there. So Thessia would need to be replayed for 100% optimal perfect outcomes :(  Doesn't really matter, just want you to be aware.
[4:32:14] <%JoshManVGH> He has "Directors Favorite" Armor.
[4:32:15] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt They were originally going to have him kill a squadmate
[4:32:18] <%tusk102> also wouldn't there just be a second floor below the weird pits? why would they build on a fucking pit @PatStaresAt
[4:32:20] <%maskedsongbird> Even with the ending, ME3 would be dramatically improved with the exorcism of Kai Leng from the story.
[4:32:22] <%The_0_2_Hero> Kai Leng feels like he comes from a different sci-fi property
[4:32:22] <%Agami23> he is a naruto character put into mass effect
[4:32:25] <hassanico2> @Monkeyweed21 aaaahhhhh it is goddamnit
[4:32:26] <QuestlordJake> you're forced to play with the neighbor's kid you don't like
[4:32:26] <Brandon__Brando> plus look how big this lose is to
[4:32:26] <AngryAsian5> But he ate someone else's cereal that one time tho. LUL
[4:32:27] <teridax4> He just nonchalantly dodges the missiles
[4:32:27] <%JamesCorck> Plot Armour.
[4:32:29] <d3ltuhhh> @Dabrikishaw SAY WHAT
[4:32:34] <%InternetShis> shockwaves
[4:32:34] <%GabeSweetMan> @QueequegTheater Oh fuck that.
[4:32:36] <kikoeru_san> he's a writer's crutch, he's like Mari Makinami
[4:32:36] <%Broand> WHen kai leng isn't in the scene, everyone should be asking "where's kai leng?"
[4:32:36] <%kyh9> He's just Sasuke Uchiha
[4:32:39] <TioXyco> god being kai leng, I assume?
[4:32:41] <%kyh9> He's literally just Sasuke Uchiha
[4:32:41] <%JamesCorck> Plot Armour of the worst kind, this whole part fucking sucks shits.
[4:32:53] <lehvak182> Kyle should just be called Deus Ex Machina
[4:32:54] <ShiningAxis> Rocks fall, everyone dies
[4:32:54] <%afronooch> Yeah
[4:32:55] <Jaysky> It is
[4:32:56] <blackjack8182> Pat Tearing into this shit gives me life!
[4:32:57] <RushUnplugged> don't fucking bother
[4:32:57] <%JoshManVGH> The Almighty Golden Finger of God holds your character down, so you can't win.
[4:32:58] <+miguelrod777> a full ass gunship has to even the fight between kai and shep
[4:33:00] <%kyh9> Eh, fuck it
[4:33:00] <%bread_assassin> Yeah
[4:33:00] <+miguelrod777> yes
[4:33:01] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck it, cheat, who cares
[4:33:03] <RushUnplugged> for real don't
[4:33:03] <%AmuserName> it's REALLY DUMB
[4:33:04] <peachy996> perfection is overrated
[4:33:04] <%LumberjackJack> Eh, it's fine
[4:33:05] <wibbwobbler> Definitely oc energy
[4:33:05] <%AmericanSkidd> that is dumb
[4:33:05] <%sporeian94> don't worry about it it doesn't effect the ending
[4:33:06] <%afronooch> gotta always para or always ren
[4:33:06] <+spartanghost004> unfortunately
[4:33:06] <hassanico2> That's true more than once
[4:33:08] <%Deadpal> no you're fine
[4:33:08] <Minorou> not worth the effort
[4:33:09] <%kingmemelord97> i just wanna know why shepherd didnt call in fire support on that gunship
[4:33:10] <Jmann1892> Kai Leng literally needs the author to be actively against the player to win
[4:33:11] <%Deadpal> you're actually fine.
[4:33:11] <%Monkeyweed21> @DXLelouch24 he's a big ME fan so when they offered the role for 3 he accepted right away, then he read the script and looked at Kai Leng and went "oh no"
[4:33:12] <%DrTomT18> What???
[4:33:12] <%DracosMagala> Why Kai Leng didn't have any Phantoms is beyond me NotLikeThis
[4:33:12] <SaltyAzteca> @JamesCorck Not plot armor, this goes beyond plot armor
[4:33:12] <%YakumoYomi> Gief agrees
[4:33:13] <+toastybites> Gief agrees
[4:33:13] <olaksi> I mean you could write a character who seems  to be above the rules... you'd just have to write it like that first
[4:33:16] <%ThomasOfTroy> You should redo the temple anyway since you missed a fuck ton of lore
[4:33:16] <NeroInfinite> it's extremly stupid
[4:33:16] <%SABiscotti> do NOT bother, ain't worth it
[4:33:17] <peachy996> Do not give in to the goblins
[4:33:17] <Sp3ctre48> It is! but it doesn't really matter
[4:33:18] <%InternetShis> I did not know that, that's stupid, he doesn't control shit
[4:33:18] <hassanico2> You have to 100% Paragon/Renegade for MULTIPLE choices
[4:33:19] <%Deadpal> pat has enough paragon to ignore that.
[4:33:19] <Kat_k> its the same in 1...
[4:33:20] <%kyh9> It really doesnt matter
[4:33:21] <%RigmaroleHM> Play whatever choices you make but they're the wrong ones
[4:33:22] <Zombrocom> Yeh not worth it
[4:33:24] <Realimpact> you missed some Javik dialogue before you touch the beacon
[4:33:24] <%Deadpal> you just need extremely high paragon.
[4:33:25] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt could be wrong, he was originally supposed to perma kill a teammate here iirc
[4:33:25] <%SABiscotti> oh this gets DRAWN out lmao

[4:33:50] <@Ranryu692> it's important to leave the Citadel dlc for last so that there's something to look forward to
[4:33:50] <peachy996> The SHADOW BROKER knows nothing
[4:33:52] <$hattrick61> hey look its everyone guranteed to be alive
[4:33:53] <@QueequegTheater> cheer500 This won't make sense to you, but it will make sense to chat: Calling Kai Leng a shitty Jetstream Sam is an insult to Adam Taurus
[4:33:54] <%Deadpal> lol I thought he said traitor.

You're not as weak as I thought. But never forget that your best wasn't good enough to stop me. Now an entire planet is dying because you lacked the strength to win. The legend of Shepard needs to be re-written. I hope I'm there for the last chapter. It ends with your death.
