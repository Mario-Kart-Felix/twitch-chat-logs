[0:06:54] <%PauliusMaximus> yeah thats me :D
[0:06:55] <%Anonymasque> Not a fan of the designs in the screencaps though.. but hey Outbreak pls.
[0:06:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Plays like REmake RE2?
[0:07:01] <thewellroundedgamer99> Thoughts on Yakuza 7?
[0:07:06] <%Urgotfantasy> Sure is patrick
[0:07:08] <+valkuma> what do you think about turning Yakuza into a Turn based Strategy game IMMEDIATELY after trying to bring it to the west?
[0:07:21] <%Shadicara> 2020 is the age of everything becoming turn based
[0:07:22] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Man, I fucking love The Police. What a good band.
[0:07:22] <%supersugoisenpai1> 410 billion dead cops
[0:07:24] <%ORGANizerC> i think it's an excellent move
[0:07:25] <Ion_Laser> I saw the Resistance screenshots on Sphere Hunter's twitter. Definitely looks like an Outbreak game
[0:07:29] <@lewdskeletor13> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 I’m 100% convinced that one of the writers at Hardrive is a fan of you and Woolz. Still not a fan of the new combat stuff in Yakuza 7. I feel like it should’ve been a spin off. It’s kinda killed my enthusiasm for it, especially after I loved the combat in Judgement. Anyway here’s hoping this game will be... off the chain Kappa

[0:09:09] <@lewdskeletor13> *Palpatine voice* DO IT
[0:09:10] <%Laecerelius> Try tanking out with your adventurer squad first to get a general feel for it I guess
[0:09:12] <%TDotGoat> and if you fail, it's just PUGs
[0:09:13] <StupidCritter> Yeah
[0:09:14] <Marpolo13> just realize even if you do right, people will be dumb anyway
[0:09:16] <Teyaric> you level the class, dumbass. you'll get dungeons with 6 moves and still DO IT

[0:09:38] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I can answer the question good! Make the enemies not look at friends, keep aggro, don't activate ALL your cooldowns at once.

[0:10:05] <%Laecerelius> I went into Stone Vigil once with a tank who didn't even know the basics of how to tank and our party had to teach them while doing the dungeon
[0:10:06] <poweruser> but if you don't do as well as that guy then no1 will play with you ever, might aswell quit because it's not multiplayer anymore
[0:10:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Play assuming that the healer isn't going to heal you. Because if you are being an idiot, chances are they won't.

[0:20:44] <%Rain_Mage> @AngriestPat how do you think they'll handle the Sephiroth Clones in the remake?
[0:20:45] <%ElenaManetta> Oh, I hope the remake goes full blown horror with this town
[0:20:48] <AdmiralButtloaf> in the flashback theres two kids. the younger would imitate the older
[0:20:49] <krymzen5> ur not my mom
[0:20:51] <%ElenaManetta> I want the music to make me feel like death is approaching
[0:20:51] <bakkatohri> The bathhouse/crossdressing shenanigans better be in the remake
[0:20:56] <+BigCoffee> During development of Final Fantasy VII, Zangan was planned to be found in Nibelheim in person, where he would tell Cloud that the survivors of the town's destruction had been killed by Shinra, and he would relate to Tifa that he took her to safety. This was ultimately cut from the game.
[0:20:57] <%Shadicara> Where's mumbo
[0:20:59] <%radda343> excuse me you're in my house
[0:21:06] <%SpcOpsBear> @bakkatohri They confirmed it would be, I think.
[0:21:07] <%dheng1> Anxious always gives off a creepy vibe
[0:21:07] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[0:21:11] <%SpcOpsBear> Or at least the crossdressing.
[0:21:11] <T3merity> Cloud is a Nibelheim truther
[0:21:15] <%Shadicara> YOU'RE SICK
[0:21:16] <vedammi> my howse now
[0:21:16] <%Owkono> they probably jenova'd the kids
[0:21:21] <%InugamiTheHound> where is cloud's mom
[0:21:23] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How many fireplaces does this house need? 6?
[0:21:23] <%ElenaManetta> Jesus Christ, why does the cloak man move so slowl like that
[0:21:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> This would be some shit if Tifa also wasn't from this town
[0:21:28] <Desertfishing> panty raid!
[0:21:28] <%ElenaManetta> It's like a black slug
[0:21:29] <patismyhero> So Harmonious the atmosphere of this location.

[0:50:03] <%AgentOrangeShoes> GREAT STORY WOWEE
[0:50:05] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Pat, you may not know this, but there was a game called "Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII", which stars Vincent, and was the best Final Fantasy ever created. Just FYI.
[0:50:05] <%supersugoisenpai1> He was only the most famous SOLDIER to ever live. Who doesn't know him?
[0:50:06] <%waltzqueen> OOPS
[0:50:07] <Marpolo13> OOPS
[0:50:07] <+Thomzzz> Sephiroth: Bringing families together since 97
[0:50:07] <%salty_syd913> oops
[0:50:08] <%AncelDeLambert> which makes no sense because he's a huge national hero
[0:50:09] <+BGDoombringer> Its fine
[0:50:09] <+CaptainGrime> OOPS
[0:50:10] <Guardiansaiyan> OOOOOOPPPPSSS

[0:50:26] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat obviously this is Sephiroth MARK 2
[0:50:27] <@CoalSavoie> He meant he found out 5 years ago
[0:50:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> You're talking right now asshole
[0:50:28] <%Big_Dream> Mr.Edgy @AngriestPat
[0:50:29] <%supersugoisenpai1> Remake will fix it
[0:50:29] <+Pookiedaexzile> Crisis core is no longer cannon
[0:50:30] <knyttstories> I think he meant that five years ago, he found out how he was created, but translation bad
[0:50:32] <%Anonymasque> I mean he also has a brother in crisis core who's a pop star sooo... lorSHRUG
[0:50:32] <rytisone> they just forgot, like clumbo

[1:36:44] <%supersugoisenpai1> You can use arrange to swap them
[1:36:48] <Valdorick> Remind me, I forget - does cover get affected by backrow protection?
[1:36:49] <blink289> down
[1:36:49] <mayorrev> EARTH WIND AND FIRE
[1:36:49] <%AncelDeLambert> @AngriestPat use the Arrange button to exchange your materia quickly
[1:36:50] <%r_Foeburden87> DONT DO IT manual
[1:36:54] <ScreamLord> @AngriestPat 15 minutes until Popo's Bizarre Investigation
[1:36:54] <b_ikki> blindbo
[1:36:56] <acedeone> stop yanking my Astral chain
[1:36:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat DUDE you know you can go to "Arrange" (BOTTOM LEFT) and just exchange materia, right??
[1:36:58] <mayorrev> DO YPU REMEMBER
[1:36:59] <+TheAzureWolfe> Does he know he can swap them from the Arrange Menu?
[1:36:59] <zaynzidel> go to check and switch entire materia on person
[1:36:59] <derekwst3> CAPTAIN PLANET
[1:37:00] <ShichiNoBushi> Might as well not use Fire for this fight.
[1:37:03] <majindusto> YUFFIE WILL HELP
[1:37:09] <%sl8r4l8r> HE'S A HERO
[1:37:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Yuffie is strong as hell, too

[1:37:20] <kaltmj> lol i hope they modernized this system in the remake
[1:37:20] <supuhmagikarp> got any equipment that decreases electric damage? Thrine is Electric
[1:37:21] <+Pendragwn> @ScreamLord I immediately thought of that guy from DBZ
[1:37:22] <ittla> materia bugs me because it only really becomes interesting to play with at endgame
[1:37:22] <derekwst3> use Dr Acula, he will beast
[1:37:25] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat I honestly think TIfa just ends up as stronger than Red naturally for reasons I don't remember. So you should be able to swap them back and forth... but Tifa will be better at either roll.
[1:37:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Pat's not gonna use Naruto
[1:37:29] <%QuadraticGravity> is pat dying to the cave boss

[1:41:19] <Roz_Lynd> it was.... a thing
[1:41:20] <zaynzidel> the complete version is okay has some fun fanservice.

[1:41:41] <Brother_Coduss> 8 MINUTES
[1:41:42] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat 10 mins until ASTRAL CHAIN
[1:41:53] <%starotter70> I think I cheesed this boss using Aqualung
[1:41:57] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't miss Trine
[1:41:57] <Roz_Lynd> bear in mind that hell combo had a % to crit
[1:42:00] <%NeroInfinite> naah

[1:42:05] <zaynzidel> it's cool how sephi kicks clouds ass when he uses his original omnislash and gets punked out by his new one.
[1:42:06] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat oh now you jinxed it
[1:42:06] <Valdorick> Shown - not doing that
[1:42:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Advent Children is fanfic crap
[1:42:19] <%Shadicara> Maybe Kappa
[1:42:21] <+Ilpala> what about quake2 you tried that yet
[1:42:26] <+Pendragwn> now not only will you not finish it in 10 minutes but Astal Chain will also not unlock on time
[1:42:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> Advent Children was an OK movie, but it is definitely not a movie that I would say is necessary to watch for Final Fantasy 7 fans. Like Dirge of Cerberus, except Dirge of Cerberus SUCKED
[1:42:28] <Valdorick> No no, Crisis Core is Fanfic Crap
[1:42:32] <Mnightshyamallama> Pat you can poison this boss
[1:42:39] <derekwst3> OSFrog are very okay
[1:42:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @AncelDeLambert If Advent Children is fan fic, the dirge of cerberus is too Kappa
[1:42:45] <b_ikki> literally all of the ffvii comp is fanfic crap
[1:42:46] <blink289> @AncelDeLambert dilly dally silly shally
[1:42:47] <%Shadicara> Did you doubt the REDBULL pat
[1:42:48] <%InugamiTheHound> I'm sad to hear all the voice actors from AC won't voice them in ff7remake
[1:42:50] <%dayz1003> Did you know that cat purrs are scientifically proven to lower your blood pressure? It's true.
[1:42:55] <Brother_Coduss> Hey guys, how about THE SPIRIT WITHIN
[1:42:57] <ShichiNoBushi> I remember Pat didn't care for cats any before he started living with Elmo.
[1:43:01] <%MrBorisMakarov> MrBorisMakarov subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! Finally started getting my ass in gear to get my career dreams going, 9 years at walmart is just too much, a few days ago i started courses to get some computer security certificates.
[1:43:12] <%Shadicara> Fuck off don't mention spirit within apatFist
[1:43:13] <rytisone> always play the same exact way, never experiment
[1:43:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> @Brother_Coduss That has been retroactively stricken from existence
[1:43:18] <Valdorick> Cat purs also have healing properties.
[1:43:19] <CurrySauseBandit> @rumtumtugnutz TAKE THAT BACK! Dirge SUCKED ASS HARDER THAN PAIGE GULPS DOWN MUSTARD
[1:43:20] <%dayz1003> good for you @MrBorisMakarov !
[1:43:21] <%starotter70> @Brother_Coduss You know, how bout no
[1:43:27] <zaynzidel> don't use fire you nerd!!!!!!!!!!!!\
[1:43:28] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Spirits within was good
[1:43:28] <%ElenaManetta> At least it's not Leech
[1:43:28] <+Pendragwn> KITTY
[1:43:30] <star_feline> @MrBorisMakarov Ayy congrats dude!
[1:43:31] <lilo52> How long until Astral Chain?
[1:43:36] <zaynzidel> you thought about it i saw you.
[1:43:39] <kingbaconcrispy> You mean garbo ?
[1:43:39] <majindusto> DIRGE of CERBERUS is FUN
[1:43:41] <$jobbedbone> use reflect?
[1:43:41] <TheHeroAppears> you cast heal on your self
[1:43:44] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat yes, how rude. only you, the player, may heal themselves
[1:43:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> @CurrySauseBandit I AGREE! DIRGE OF CERBERUS WAS FUCKING TRASH
[1:43:45] <%dayz1003> I need to make big changes in my career too. My job is killing me.
[1:43:47] <+Ilpala> man that poison isn't sticking
[1:43:48] <%mankeyfigh> Did I use Beta to cheese this fight? I think I did
[1:43:49] <Thepothero> i see da emlo cirOwO
[1:43:50] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> I mean the best thing that ever existed
[1:43:54] <lilo52> sick
[1:43:56] <%AncelDeLambert> "PAIIIIIIGE, the boss is using cure, I don't like that!" "PAAAAT, the boss is using estus, I don't like that!"
[1:43:58] <Valdorick> Oh god, I always forget that Spirit Within was a fucking Final Fantasy thing.
[1:44:01] <zaynzidel> beta is fire damage
[1:44:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> Edward James Elmos

[1:44:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> nailed it
[1:44:09] <doggieo> EASY
[1:44:10] <SulfurousAcid> but most bosses don't have poison resist pat
[1:44:11] <+BGDoombringer> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[1:44:12] <%arancet> don't expect it to unlock instantly at midnight
[1:44:12] <%castarts> nice
[1:44:13] <zaynzidel> first try
[1:44:16] <hippieofdeath> PAIGE RIGHT
[1:44:16] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Go down the path next to the one you take to leave to Rocket Town, you can jump down and make your way to the Reactor you see in the Flashback. Go behind the Reactor and through that door is the area with the pipes and ladders, you can then push the ladder down and/or go back across the bridge and get REDBULL13's DOUBLE weapon.
[1:44:16] <Brother_Coduss> @AngriestPat thank you paige
[1:44:19] <%Intolerable> YEYEYEY
[1:44:20] <%Shadicara> Blown away

[1:44:22] <Roz_Lynd> pattyGoodGamer
[1:44:22] <+Pendragwn> @Valdorick it looked real neat but nothing made sense
[1:44:23] <%Nina96> FIRST TRY
[1:44:24] <b_ikki> paige wins again
[1:44:24] <%supersugoisenpai1> COUNTER
[1:44:24] <%Laecerelius> That ring is truly outrageous
[1:44:28] <derekwst3> @AngriestPat paige was right about the skills
[1:44:33] <%starotter70> @AngriestPat Paaaaaat, people are talking about Spirits Within again!
[1:44:37] <blink289> reading the news and apparently Last year, a construction worker miraculously survived after he was electrocuted, thrown from his workstation and then impaled through the anus by a four-foot steel bar.
[1:44:38] <Mnightshyamallama> The speedrun strat involves poisoning that boss. So it is totally a thing
[1:44:40] <%rumtumtugnutz> Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
[1:44:48] <hippieofdeath> Another victory for Pat's perfect run
[1:44:52] <star_feline> @Laecerelius truly truly truly outrageous?
[1:44:53] <%Laecerelius> Cloud should have counter! If he's gonna be taking hits for people he might as well have counter on too
[1:45:03] <Valdorick> @Pendragwn Famous for being the first 3d film with individually rendered hair strands... sadly, they spent all the money on that, and not writers.
[1:45:03] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @blink289 hey alright coxWat
[1:45:03] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Spirits Within was a fun watch when I was a kid, and had never played a FF game.
[1:45:05] <ShichiNoBushi> Already forgot about the Exchange feature.
[1:45:05] <%MrBorisMakarov> @blink289 WutFace
[1:45:16] <SulfurousAcid> Clumbo has to white knight
[1:45:20] <Roz_Lynd> what you really want is cover-counter
[1:45:30] <Mnightshyamallama> The cover stays on during sex
[1:45:32] <%Intolerable> deathblow
[1:45:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> And I mostly think that people hate on it because it's different from all the FF games they played.
[1:45:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Spirits Within would have been remembered more fondly if they hadn't pretended it was a Final Fantasy for sure
[1:45:36] <%radda343> don't put eskill on cloud's weapon, it doesn't need the double ap
[1:45:36] <Finakala> Emlo is confused
[1:45:40] <fIashman92> Did Pat talk about turn based Yakuza?
[1:45:40] <%Shadicara> Clumblow
[1:45:41] <majindusto> Advent children is a Final Fantasy related...unlike The Spirits Within crap
[1:45:44] <+TheMattman1313> Doesn't Astral Chain come out in like 5 mins?
[1:45:50] <Roz_Lynd> yes it does

[1:46:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat (Re-sending because you were doing materia stuff): Go down the path next to the one you take to leave to Rocket Town, you can jump down and make your way to the Reactor you see in the Flashback. Go behind the Reactor and through that door is the area with the pipes and ladders, you can then push the ladder down and/or go back across the bridge and get REDBULL13's DOUBLE weapon.
[1:46:09] <TheHeroAppears> I don't care what anyone says final fantasy the spirits within is one of my favorite movies

[1:46:31] <b_ikki> yes hoe
[1:46:32] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> No FF game is related to another except that 13 and 10 crap. So what if the movie Spirits Within wasn't related?
[1:46:33] <Brother_Coduss> But spirits within totally had Gaia! and a Shinra expy! it's OBVIOUSLY final fantasy!

[2:13:42] <derekwst3> you have hi potion
[2:13:45] <RiceeFTW> say NOTHING
[2:13:45] <Omega1180> this is not dred
[2:13:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> He has a protagonist helmet
[2:13:47] <%ElenaManetta> It's easier to make a team of policemen if you just need one model
[2:13:48] <Valdorick> Helmets are Hardly Heroic, Paige.
[2:13:48] <%mh9s> his anime face is his armor
[2:13:51] <star_feline> Anime don't need helmets
[2:13:52] <RiceeFTW> HOW DO YOU KNOW THE VOICE
[2:13:52] <%Keyd00d> DO YOU READ ME "..."
[2:13:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> He doesn't need a helmet when he has plot armor
[2:13:54] <%ssjklyco> You look like Connie from Attack on Titan
[2:13:54] <+Scevda> Never mention them by name tho
[2:13:57] <%cureneckbeard> ※ apatJpeg

[2:13:59] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Are the subtitles SUPER SLOW and behind the audio?? Or is it just me?
[2:14:06] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Pat plays his fantasy, a weird mute
[2:14:07] <%Keyd00d> never use those
[2:14:08] <BourneWarrior> Platinum Dog P-Dog Pog PogChamp
[2:14:08] <blink289> do police salute
[2:14:09] <transporterthesequel> Space Marine rules
[2:14:10] <%AgentOrangeShoes> You gotta let me know how anime you truly are
[2:14:11] <krksobk> you can customise your outfit and slap on a helmet iirc
[2:14:12] <Finakala> Protagonists never wear helmets, unless they're like Doomguy or some shit
[2:14:12] <@lewdskeletor13> This anime is so thick you could cut it with a knife
[2:14:13] <fmc009> Platinum dog best stand
[2:14:13] <%Laecerelius> So use those temp items, Pat!
[2:14:14] <blink289> seems wierd
[2:14:15] <TheAkex> @AngriestPat i think i played gambit with you (or maybe an impostor) were you a warlock using outbreak and crown of tempest?
[2:14:16] <transporterthesequel> If you wear a helmet you're good as dead
[2:14:18] <%InugamiTheHound> was that cripsin freeman? He needs bigger VO roles
[2:14:18] <%Shadicara> So use items pat
[2:14:19] <b_ikki> so dont use them ever got it
[2:14:20] <FunkyStreams> This is basically what Pats life would have been if you had normal sized legs.
[2:14:21] <Valdorick> So don't hoard, got it... SO NEVER USE ITEMS
[2:14:22] <danknugglit> Who needs protective gear when you have plot armour

[2:50:55] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Yoseph might be Gendo, but he might also be Aramaki.
[2:50:57] <star_feline> Oh god, they made it 30 fps for CINEMATIC ANIME
[2:50:57] <arkv01> is this 30fps?

[2:51:11] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, use your witch time!
[2:51:11] <+Take_2_shots> Is this just the opening to Dredd?
[2:51:23] <%TheMattman1313> Cuz the Switch
[2:51:23] <Zombrocom> Switch limits
[2:51:24] <RupanSen> >switch
[2:51:30] <derekwst3> 30 is fine for me anyway
[2:51:31] <+ChainsawBees> why did he restart?
[2:51:38] <lokiluko> it's an anime game, so are there social links, is your twin one of them, and is he/she romancable. Or is it not quite that "anime".
[2:51:38] <+Fenlig> Is this PC with 30fps? :S
[2:51:39] <b_ikki> astral chained to 30fps atpFeelsBeardMan
[2:51:41] <+Scevda> Totally not sexual
[2:51:44] <%cureneckbeard> the human eye can't see more than 24fps
[2:51:45] <$renegadehatter> Please show up in cutscenes female pat
[2:51:47] <%vinnysuperg123> Why the FUCK is this so much like Nier
[2:51:47] <derekwst3> @ChainsawBees he wanted bluer eyes
[2:51:50] <ravencloak13> It’s Switch exclusive.
[2:51:52] <%AncelDeLambert> Honestly, it's good for companies to start limiting themselves to the Switch's hardware, it teaches them to do more with less
[2:51:53] <star_feline> If it gets ported do you think the framerate will be unlocked?
[2:51:54] <+ChainsawBees> lmfao
[2:51:55] <%vinnysuperg123> I keep thinking this is fucking Nier
[2:51:55] <Caidezes> I hope Bayo 3 isn't 30 FPS. :/
[2:51:55] <$renegadehatter> @Fenlig Switch Exclusive
[2:51:59] <%ElenaManetta> Pat did you restart? Why are you playing the first mission again apatJpeg apatJpeg apatJpeg
[2:52:01] <+Fenlig> Lame
[2:52:02] <ShichiNoBushi> But I'm attention deficit.
[2:52:08] <TheGershon> Don't worry guys, in 5 or so years switch emulation will be good enough to play this at 4k60 cctdrfGachi
[2:52:11] <b_ikki> it won't get ported
[2:52:12] <%AKPC_> remembre, when you get to the first walking segment, go back to the tunnel, for SECRETS... probably
[2:52:14] <%cureneckbeard> sipsipSipsipblind
[2:52:14] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @ChainsawBees You only get letter ranks when playing on "hard". Just makes it more like DMC

[2:53:10] <star_feline> Didn't get dog rank LUL
[2:53:10] <%Laecerelius> But it's not SSS, Pat!
[2:53:13] <%AncelDeLambert> You should have been a pole dancer
[2:53:15] <ShichiNoBushi> The 'S' is for "sucks".
[2:53:16] <derekwst3> this is kamen rider
[2:53:16] <%cureneckbeard> S
[2:53:17] <arkv01> there are 5 humans left in this city and they're all cops
[2:53:20] <%1buckboom> Holy shit this is stylish as fuck
[2:53:23] <JDebss> Anyone else happy for ProJared?

[2:53:28] <%Onlysamfisher > lol I already subbed like 2 days ago but I can sun again apparently?
[2:53:29] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The "S" if for STRONG
[2:53:29] <derekwst3> dont save them
[2:53:29] <RupanSen> Taura was the combat designer on Automata IIRC
[2:53:29] <Valdorick> 5% attack speed
[2:53:33] <mayorrev> I don't understand what's wrong with journalist mode
[2:53:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> the s is for SHIT
[2:53:39] <%AKPC_> ALWAYS CHECK BEHIND YOU PAT apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin apatGoblin
[2:53:40] <ravencloak13> @jdebss He had proof they were lying so yeah.
[2:53:41] <buerdo> Wasn’t there S+?
[2:53:41] <ButtPlacenta> how long do you think this game is if you didn't want to replay missions?
[2:53:43] <+Scevda> @RupanSen Ah, so a reward game
[2:53:52] <b_ikki> look back for alfheims
[2:53:55] <+HyperCharge_Sam> you equip it on your legion
[2:54:27] <VERDAXY> to the CHOPA
[2:54:31] <Mendin> I love the Dyson Ring chopper blades
[2:54:32] <+Scevda> Totally not doomed chopper TM
[2:54:38] <Conky89> Oh really?
[2:54:39] <%supersugoisenpai1> nice
[2:54:40] <%Shadicara> Good
[2:54:41] <JDebss> @ravencloak13 Yeah just goes to show you not to judge
[2:54:42] <star_feline> Holy fuck how?
[2:54:43] <californaya> I've heard 24-ish hours
[2:54:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> That's a good time
[2:54:45] <ButtPlacenta> holy shit
[2:54:46] <KasiCrafter> Wonderful 101, here we go again.
[2:54:47] <Vlesh> I'm sure these guys will survive this time
[2:54:47] <%Akanesasusora> reviews have said like 20-40 hours, right?
[2:54:50] <Mendin> 30 Hours? For a Platinum game? Jesus christ
[2:54:50] <Cranky_Construct> Man thats the best
[2:54:53] <danknugglit> Niceu desu
[2:54:54] <aeonicvector> So about DMCV length? Shits great
[2:54:56] <Ner234> 20 - 30 or so I've heard
[2:54:59] <%InugamiTheHound> gamespot was 40+ hours
[2:54:59] <ravencloak13> I keep hearing it’s about 20 hours and who knows how many side quest.
[2:55:00] <+lordsdb> that short
[2:55:01] <ScreamLord> MIKE! WutFace
[2:55:01] <%dekkitout> Nice, with my scrub like tendencies, it'll be 60+ hours on plat mode
[2:55:04] <%ssjklyco> it's Okami of character action then
[2:55:06] <pillowwasp> All these DEAD COPS
[2:55:09] <b_ikki> and then you don't
[2:55:12] <+CaptainGrime> not dead at all
[2:55:13] <%floralkami> okay, so like 3 seasons worth
[2:55:16] <+Scevda> World is a fuck
[2:55:17] <%NeroInfinite> The Dyson ring choppers are great
[2:55:18] <%ElenaManetta> To be FAIR, real police would also do that
[2:55:20] <Valdorick> They perfect Parried the impact, and took no damage.
[2:55:24] <CrowbarFacelift> Wow, expected like 10-12 hours tops
[2:55:25] <ruggles322> I am surprised this isn't a Woolie and Pat game
[2:55:28] <%ElenaManetta> You wouldn't see police watch a helicopter crash and then turn around and walk away
[2:55:31] <star_feline> now THAT looks stylish
[2:55:32] <+Scevda> @NeroInfinite agreed
[2:55:41] <KaseKaizer> this looks REALLY impressive for a Switch game
[2:55:41] <Furious_Dan> the gun gets stronger if he does poses
[2:55:46] <+Scevda> Worst shooting stance ever
[2:55:49] <Ner234> Does he NEED to spin everytime he shoots his gun?
[2:55:56] <%AKPC_> yes
[2:55:58] <b_ikki> so is perfect dodge leading to a launcher going to be a taura trait
[2:56:11] <Valdorick> Okay, but why their police uniforms need to emphasize the female ass?
[2:56:13] <ravencloak13> @scevda You say that but when he gets into a proper stance he gets bitch slapped.
[2:56:21] <+Scevda> I want a Leon - profession - as -fuck shooting stance
[2:56:23] <Vlesh> I wonder if you can DMC them with your gun after you perfect dodge launch them into the air
[2:56:23] <star_feline> @Valdorick yes because anime
[2:56:24] <VERDAXY> are they Infected?
[2:56:29] <%AKPC_> because anime @Valdorick
[2:56:29] <%Shadicara> It's almost like you went backwards instead of forwards for new combos pat LUL
[2:56:29] <ravencloak13> @valdorick But they emphasize the male asses to...
[2:56:30] <EynosStyles> Wait if normal humans can’t see chimera that how are the police even fighting these things???
[2:56:35] <Ner234> RESET
[2:56:35] <Morning_Asakura> vanquish slide
[2:56:42] <JDebss> Is it weird that this makes me want to replay Transformers Devastation?
[2:56:46] <Mendin> Pat is there Dodge Offset?
[2:56:50] <danknugglit> Fake gamer
[2:56:51] <ravencloak13> @eynosstyles Those aren’ Chimera’s. They are people turned into monsters.
[2:56:56] <ButtPlacenta> @Valdorick to enforce the law of corse
[2:56:57] <+CaptainGrime> @JDebss yes

[2:57:50] <SulfurousAcid> You read about the dodge offset Pat
[2:57:51] <%AncelDeLambert> is it "hold the button" dodge offset? Cuz I had trouble with that in Bayo
[2:58:03] <ravencloak13> It’s tap kind.
[2:58:03] <krksobk> A for a fuckin leaf
[2:58:03] <%Maids4lyfe> isn't this just the first level again?
[2:58:05] <rasamune> A for bAd. B for Bad. C for Cbad. D for baD.

[2:58:14] <Halospaz117> Darn, no Fem Pat
[2:58:20] <%Anime_Flux> I want one of these chests to be a cyber-mimic
[2:58:20] <ScreamLord> Awww, no bald Imouto
[2:58:21] <EynosStyles> How much you wanna bet you can name your Legion.
[2:58:22] <b_ikki> revengeance offset
[2:58:23] <%Maids4lyfe> oh okay @ravencloak13 thanks
[2:58:24] <star_feline> A for Aw shit here we go again
[2:58:33] <%AncelDeLambert> okay, because in Bayo while trying to dodge offset I would end up holding dodge and going into the bullet storm
[2:58:43] <derekwst3> we get to see officer JENNY again
[2:58:49] <Zombrocom> KORRA
[2:58:54] <ravencloak13> @anceldelambert You can change that in the menu for the controls.
[2:59:02] <%mh9s> koala tea
[2:59:02] <+StrawberryPantsu> YOUR TWIN SISTER
[2:59:02] <gustavozxd> is platinum standard actually hard mode though?
[2:59:02] <mayorrev> TRANSFORMERS WAS GOOD
[2:59:03] <ShichiNoBushi> Korra, Transformers, TMNT...
[2:59:04] <lilo52> no, revengeance hasn't been topped
[2:59:07] <derekwst3> transformers kinda sucked because it was way to short
[2:59:07] <NiktenKing> That Grandblue Fantasy game looks amazing
[2:59:07] <%radda343> no you skipped the henshin
[2:59:07] <shevan123> transformer was pretty good though
[2:59:07] <Morning_Asakura> devestation was GOOD
[2:59:08] <Biscuitsfordays> ASTRAL CHAIN~!
[2:59:09] <%floralkami> hey, even Transformers was fun
[2:59:12] <ravencloak13> Least from the latest version of it.
[2:59:13] <NiktenKing> Granblue rather
[2:59:13] <lokiluko> what's the term for when you need to dodge in combo to speed up the attack animations to do optimal dps?
[2:59:13] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> agree to disagree
[2:59:15] <%AncelDeLambert> @ravencloak13 in here, or in Bayo?
[2:59:15] <derekwst3> Tmnt also sucked
[2:59:17] <b_ikki> if you mean production then sure
[2:59:20] <matheuspomp> transformers was good
[2:59:20] <lilo52> and transformers is fantastic
[2:59:21] <+paladinstarbuster> part partner LUL
[2:59:22] <ravencloak13> @anceldelambert Both.
[2:59:23] <%floralkami> @derekwst3 truuuuuuu
[2:59:23] <+Scevda> "My hips are moving on their own"
[2:59:24] <JDebss> Transformers rocks
[2:59:25] <artificiallynatural> wow they've actually done a number of licensed games havent they
[2:59:25] <%AncelDeLambert> WHAAAAAAAAT?
[2:59:25] <ScreamLord> Transformers and Korra I heard were decent. TMNT tho, that was a shitshow
[2:59:28] <star_feline> What if it was PURPLE
[2:59:29] <implied_consent> Someone please tell me why the fuck he's skipping cutscenes.
[2:59:30] <%AncelDeLambert> Bayo 1?
[2:59:30] <Sokumotanaka> Korra was okay for a first attempt at avatar
[2:59:31] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Pick up the Red stuff
[2:59:34] <%sl8r4l8r> IT STANDS NEXT TO YOU
[2:59:37] <b_ikki> korra is super middling
[2:59:38] <ravencloak13> @lokiluko Dodge cancel.
[2:59:48] <krksobk> @implied_consent replaying first mission
[2:59:50] <lilo52> @implied_consent he's replaying the mission
[2:59:50] <+Scevda> @implied_consent Hes already done the chapter, redoing it on the pro difficulty
[2:59:57] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Korra was the best Avatar game, for what that's worth
[2:59:59] <%AncelDeLambert> oh god, make Jin shut up, pleaes
[3:00:00] <LandOfTheWay> why does jin's VA sound so bad in this section?
[3:00:01] <ravencloak13> It cancels frams.
[3:00:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> shut up Jin
[3:00:04] <derekwst3> i never played the korra so i have no clue on it, but TMNT put a sour taste in my mouth
[3:00:06] <%tinkerinks> this voice acting
[3:00:07] <%arcaderabbit48> The only outright bad one is the TMNT one. Everything else is decent at worst, amazing at best
[3:00:08] <ammobasket> handy
[3:00:11] <Valdorick> Star Platinum is punching over their heads
[3:00:14] <%ElenaManetta> Only a fucking mega loner would have a VIRTUAL PARTNER and still install solitaire.
[3:00:18] <+paladinstarbuster> wow solitare PogChamp
[3:00:19] <ravencloak13> @landoftheway It’s just his character.
[3:00:21] <rasamune> It's surely not on purpose but Max just sounds super exasperated to have to explain this shit
[3:00:23] <+Scevda> @arcaderabbit48 Thats my view as well
[3:00:30] <ammobasket> That man is playing Galaga
[3:00:31] <Mendin> I want to see a cranky legion
[3:00:35] <Daigrey> They're spawning from Twilight Princess gates.
[3:00:38] <%AncelDeLambert> what kind of tech head installs Solitaire but not Minesweeper?
[3:00:39] <NiktenKing> Jin seems like one of those lazy nerd types that gets jealous when someone shows him up
[3:00:40] <+Scevda> @ammobasket lol
[3:00:49] <Spiralpower1620> Ok I get it Sae SwiftRage
[3:00:56] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> fuck minesweeper lol
[3:00:57] <+StrawberryPantsu> Cant wait so see the sick shit people can pull off in this game
[3:00:58] <EynosStyles> Can you customize your Legion? I wonder...
[3:00:59] <star_feline> @AncelDeLambert not even doom smh
[3:01:02] <NiktenKing> Which is why he probably sounds reluctant to explain stuff to you
[3:01:03] <JDebss> a platinum made solitaire game...
[3:01:04] <Mendin> It's an Angelo
[3:01:05] <+Scevda> Welcome to DS
[3:01:06] <LandOfTheWay> @ravencloak13 i mean, he sounded much better in the next scene at HQ. he just sound really snotty here for no reason

[3:01:35] <+Saggitori> frame traps
[3:01:36] <%AKPC_> kick his ass pat!
[3:01:40] <Daigrey> These the armored types from DMC4?
[3:01:40] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> It already looks better on character action game difficulty.
[3:01:47] <Conky89> No doubt that platinum mode is the true way to play this game.
[3:01:57] <b_ikki> it's just normal lol
[3:01:59] <%ssjklyco> They look like untextured warframes
[3:02:00] <Sypheck> Warframe sure looks different now atpOkubo
[3:02:01] <+CaptainGrime> pat you have to dodge the hits not eat them LUL
[3:02:02] <Zombrocom> Aight, so play on standard, got it
[3:02:03] <derekwst3> @Daigrey basicly
[3:02:10] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> How's the game so far. I am distracted by dog
[3:02:12] <+Scevda> @ssjklyco I said similar earlier
[3:02:17] <+CaptainGrime> @Sphincter_Spelunker jamin
[3:02:25] <Spiralpower1620> Pat USE your Devil breaker SwiftRage

[3:02:43] <%AncelDeLambert> who's first?
[3:02:43] <ravencloak13> @angriestpat Don’t worry Pat, there is a Stand you can get that lets you tank hits cause you wear it.
[3:02:45] <+Scevda> @floralkami nocie
[3:02:45] <%MagickBurritoh> music slaps
[3:02:55] <Mendin> Not only did Platinum improve their Platinumness, but they also improved the Accessibility for Casuals mode too with Easy and Full Baby options (compare to Nier Automata)
[3:02:59] <EynosStyles> @ravencloak13 Do you also capture new chimera to use as your Legion?
[3:03:05] <%AncelDeLambert> of course it's max

[3:31:28] <%TheSniperJoe> lol the actor doesn't pick the best read, that's the director or more often the guy mixing it who is doing the CQ run.
[3:31:30] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Japan is weird when it demands English VA
[3:31:30] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Greaaaat ResidentSleeper
[3:31:31] <ravencloak13> He’s so consistent with the way he talks like this so I feel like it’s just the character.

[3:32:48] <%wolfofsound> "be a computer program and not a human"
[3:32:51] <EynosStyles> @angriestpat He had to be more Japanese. And speak with no emotions
[3:32:51] <%Whudss> i love that anime cop is a genre especially future anime cop
[3:32:51] <star_feline> They probably didn't care because tutorial
[3:32:52] <+king_of_beggars> We directed poorly on purpose. As a joke.
[3:32:54] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> This is def stilted. Likely the director.
[3:32:56] <+Fynale> they also seem to be trying to make him sound bored
[3:32:56] <Valdorick> "Okay, so, you're a nerdy cop, but you're kinda cocky, so do a cocky nerd"

[3:33:50] <+FierceDeityGabe> That wasn't a 3 year old who said that
[3:33:59] <+Fynale> it's like content creation you have to treat every video like it could be the first video that someone is watching
[3:34:03] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> You know what it means LUL
[3:34:06] <rasamune> They have to assume this is someone's first video game, because it very well might be
[3:34:07] <%MegboyManuel> your tutorial should preferably fun and organic
[3:34:08] <Valdorick> USE THE ITEM PAT
[3:34:10] <Sokumotanaka> @Kejang Or you
[3:34:11] <%DedlokPM> Every game can be someone's first game.
[3:34:12] <%wolfofsound> @AngriestPat it means drop your shield means do the fucking game mechanic
[3:34:14] <@lewdskeletor13> Games usually have to assume that this might actually be your first game
[3:34:17] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Woolie needs a little hand holding sometimes. We all saw FE.

[3:34:42] <%MegboyManuel> LOL
[3:34:45] <%thunderborn32> you have to do 3 daigo parries before school each day timmy
[3:34:46] <gustavozxd> that's a dead kid
[3:34:47] <NiktenKing> Takeshi's Challenge
[3:34:47] <+Noelle808> Battle Toads is cruel and unusual
[3:34:47] <lemon_lore> he the beats it first try
[3:34:48] <alrobot2014> that's child cruelty
[3:34:49] <LaughingCatt> you have doomed timmy
[3:34:49] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Fuckin A Paige, you trying to murder children?
[3:34:49] <+chisos666> that's evil...
[3:34:49] <Daigrey> Timmy Boivin
[3:34:50] <Neo_Kaiser> I played Battletoads when I was 5.
[3:34:52] <eiightbiitt> the kid would starve nakkiREE nakkiREE nakkiREE
[3:34:52] <%Laecerelius> no, he has to beat it in co-op with his sibling!
[3:34:53] <aeonicvector> "we only need you to get past this bike level to get dinner"
[3:34:53] <implied_consent> No, Pat. The child will eat. Hunger is a powerful motivator.
[3:34:55] <@lewdskeletor13> Timmy you need to defeat Sans to earn your dinner
[3:34:56] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat You high five that hilarious girl right the fuck now
[3:35:00] <+TechnicolorNinja> The Turbo tunnel will kill so many kids
[3:35:00] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat you're the most sadistic person I've EVER met ... D:
[3:35:02] <%dekkitout> Next week Prepare to Cry
[3:35:02] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Timmy never went to school
[3:35:03] <Valdorick> How to teach your kids the evils of working together at a young age; have your two children play battletoad together.
[3:35:03] <EynosStyles> You mean how Pokémon always teaches you how to capture Pokémon
[3:35:04] <%floralkami> it's also the reason why most fighting games are widely unaccessible
[3:35:07] <Mendin> That lazy grenade lob was amazing
[3:35:08] <Ion_Laser> Git Gud at Battletoads Timmy!
[3:35:10] <%NeroInfinite> YOu must beat battle toads to get thatnew game station
[3:35:12] <SpookyCarnage> Now Timmy, you know you're not allowed to have supper unless you parse at least 10k in E4S :)
[3:35:14] <Ner234> Little Timmy is now Dead
[3:35:15] <star_feline> That's an AMAZING child voice
[3:35:17] <JDebss> And you have to do it CO OP!
[3:35:17] <lilo52> no new clothes until you beat nocturne
[3:35:18] <LittleBigQuebec> "timmy, have you beat the turbo tunnel? no? no dessert then!"
[3:35:19] <SodaMelon> Maaan if they didn't say this was a PlatinumGame, I would immediately assume 5wery and Suda made this. Music, visuals, everything screams those two's style.
[3:35:20] <%MegboyManuel> Jump it OR YOU DIE
[3:35:22] <%wolfofsound> you suck that slimey turtle dick, NOW
[3:35:24] <@lewdskeletor13> Paige does great voices
[3:35:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Worse, play with either Pat or Paige as P2.
[3:35:25] <Neo_Kaiser> That Turbo Tunnel wasn't so hard
[3:35:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> BEAT THE TURBO TUNNEL YOU BiTCH
[3:35:29] <%MegboyManuel> give me food woyman!
[3:35:30] <krksobk> floaty boi
[3:35:30] <artificiallynatural> You aren't eating until you perfect the drakengard 3 final boss
[3:35:35] <+Kduff89> hes a stand of course he fly
[3:35:36] <rasamune> That said there should also be a "dude I know how to play these games just tell me the new stuff" button
[3:35:37] <%DedlokPM> "You have to beat the Jet Ski level in order to get dinner" BUT MOM! I HAVEN'T EATEN IN DAYS! "THEN YOU SHOULD BET THAT LEVEL, SON!"
[3:35:37] <derekwst3> they better teach you how to throw a pokecube
[3:35:39] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Call your Stand back
[3:35:40] <%Ynkubus18> warch as there kid crushes dwarf fortress in the future

[3:35:54] <Rosy_Joan> "Stand user tutorial"
[3:35:56] <+JavaManJoJo> you must earn a chicken dinner before you can eat your chicken dinner

[3:36:01] <LittleBigQuebec> your legion is Pure STANDO POWER
[3:36:03] <EynosStyles> @angriestpat the kid would rather go to school
[3:36:04] <iaraCatunda> legion is baby
[3:36:07] <+king_of_beggars> Paige would ebully her own kid with pictures of all the game saves she overwrote while he was at school.
[3:36:09] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Take care of your Stand
[3:36:09] <Sokumotanaka> So send it back at 10%
[3:36:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> no shit

[3:36:19] <iaraCatunda> yuuup
[3:36:20] <derekwst3> no shit they are in chains
[3:36:21] <%ssjklyco> That means at some point you can remove the limiters in this game.
[3:36:22] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Theyre probably trapped slaves
[3:36:23] <%wolfofsound> that's a starcraft hero
[3:36:23] <b_ikki> s l a v e s
[3:36:24] <TheFilth> we're the good guys :)
[3:36:25] <sirrice77> well they are actually enslaved
[3:36:26] <+Blargimazombie> Um, duh?
[3:36:26] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I can't imagine why
[3:36:28] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Like a slave? Hmmm 🤔
[3:36:30] <SodaMelon> They're definitely Chimera, feels Eva like
[3:36:31] <CherrieVelvet> what if your stand ran on batteries
[3:36:33] <%cvp5127> YEA SLAVERY
[3:36:34] <LaughingCatt> theyre probably trapped people or smoething
[3:36:34] <+trancefearence> He is literally chained at the neck
[3:36:34] <%MagickBurritoh> Eva + Stands
[3:36:34] <+Scevda> @TheFilth Are we the baddies?

[3:36:42] <Sokumotanaka> OR A PERSONA THAT STREGA HAD
[3:36:44] <Ion_Laser> :D
[3:36:45] <%arcaderabbit48> Yeah, there's no mind control or pacification here. Dude will cut you up if he gets the chance
[3:36:48] <+FierceDeityGabe> You know they tried
[3:36:49] <%connos_procrastination> LUL
[3:36:50] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat how long until that evangelion there uses Shinji the Cop to trigger Third Impact Kappa

[3:36:53] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Enslave your enemy to keep your race alive!
[3:36:55] <implied_consent> So how far into the game will you have to fight a legion?
[3:36:56] <Admiral_PopnFresh> POLICE SLAVE GHOST
[3:36:56] <b_ikki> circle-
[3:36:57] <krksobk> I'd buy five copies of POLICE SLAVE GHOSTS
[3:37:02] <rubbishbinge> Cruel Cop's Thesis
[3:37:02] <mayorrev> ***

[3:37:13] <Daxalog> @AngriestPat Did you not notice in the earlier cutscene where you see the first legion next to a normal one and the normal looks at it likes its some freak thing?
[3:37:17] <mayorrev> ttv/SpunkyRudeDonkeyRickroll
[3:37:18] <krksobk> @rubbishbinge LUL perfect

[3:37:22] <iaraCatunda> god... the way he twitched
[3:37:25] <mayorrev> tricked the system
[3:37:26] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> A better allegory for slavery than Detroit
[3:37:27] <gustavozxd> @king_wolf_rigger that would be an amazing back of the box quote LUL
[3:37:28] <Valdorick> Like a Buddy Cop movie, but the buddy is a black guy, and the story takes place in 1700s deep south.
[3:37:28] <@lewdskeletor13> Good job, Cop Ghost Slave!
[3:37:30] <Zombrocom> Slave buddy is not happy with this arrangment
[3:37:32] <SodaMelon> Oh damn, I didn't realize you could control their movement too. Dope
[3:37:32] <TheFilth> when can I do a sick Ollie off my Legion?

[3:37:39] <%connos_procrastination> Could i have a copy of POLICE SLAVE GHOSTS please
[3:37:41] <%Sovspot> are these personas you can directly control?
[3:37:46] <iaraCatunda> i hope this is a "cops bad" game
[3:37:54] <Admiral_PopnFresh> why is it Legion? wouldn't Legionnaire be more appropriate?
[3:37:54] <derekwst3> Throw a pokecube and catch the neo angelo

[3:40:52] <%GarbageNirvana> It's a totally real move that definitely isn't fake at all
[3:40:52] <Zizou_DW> Paige not knowing the Irish Whip DansGame
[3:40:52] <Sokumotanaka> When do you break the chain and summon santanel?
[3:40:58] <derekwst3> this gets better and better
[3:41:08] <EynosStyles> @ravencloak13 Hahaha that’s messed up.
[3:41:08] <ravencloak13> @sokumotanaka Later probably given the OP.
[3:41:10] <%arcaderabbit48> @Sokumotanaka Presumably the end of the game
[3:41:12] <%cureneckbeard> the chain is HERMIT PURPLE

[3:41:38] <%wolfofsound> weird stand, but ok
[3:41:40] <artificiallynatural> No wonder they have such an extensive tutorial
[3:41:42] <Daigrey> Arkham Asylum changed a lot of lives.
[3:41:42] <+kuervojones> Pat, are you gonna drop this for WoW classic?
[3:41:45] <%MegboyManuel> I get the platinum hype now
[3:41:55] <Sokumotanaka> @ravencloak13 @arcaderabbit48 LUL
[3:42:09] <%connos_procrastination> can you get stronger in here like dragon ball
[3:42:10] <lilo52> @megboymanuel where have you been for the last decade
[3:42:14] <derekwst3> call him back
[3:42:15] <+Fynale> can you bind multiple enemies at once
[3:42:23] <+Shoozle> Yes fynale
[3:42:35] <%wolfofsound> can't get over the fact that it's starcraft
[3:42:35] <%MegboyManuel> @lilo52 without a console that could play a platinum game
[3:42:36] <%connos_procrastination> @kuervojones LUL good one
[3:42:44] <ravencloak13> You just need to upgrade the length of your chain for more I think.
[3:42:50] <derekwst3> his stand recharges quickly as well
[3:42:53] <+Fynale> that's a cool ass slide
[3:42:54] <Mendin> That gun needs upgrades pronto
[3:42:57] <%Rlexp> what does the 2/2 hearts on the ui mean?
[3:42:58] <ravencloak13> Cause it barely goes around the first huge boss.
[3:43:05] <%MegboyManuel> :shrug:
[3:43:05] <+Scevda> @Mendin I suggest going shotgun
[3:43:05] <SulfurousAcid> let the gauge run out for funsies
[3:43:13] <%wolfofsound> just a blizzard stand
[3:43:15] <iaraCatunda> can you taunt????
[3:43:16] <+Shoozle> Eventually you will unlock the stinger of this game for all legions
[3:43:19] <+kuervojones> @ravencloak13 So Pat needs a longer/thicker chain?
[3:43:25] <Kejang> watch him never switch off the longsword
[3:43:29] <EynosStyles> @ravencloak13 I would have chosen GameCrash. But maybe that’s to on the nose
[3:43:36] <%TheMattman1313> SourPls
[3:43:36] <%MegboyManuel> wait there are weapon types?!
[3:43:37] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> SourPls

[3:43:49] <krksobk> SourPls
[3:43:53] <$HyperionXV> Neuron is STARS
[3:43:59] <ravencloak13> @scevda Swat basically. Your essential SPD.
[3:43:59] <+kuervojones> @ravencloak13 Do you not yank your chain?
[3:44:01] <lilo52> it's nerv
[3:44:04] <%ssjklyco> Look at that not Nerve
[3:44:05] <%DedlokPM> @MegboyManuel Revengence, Bayonetta, Vanquish and Nier Automata are all available on PC though. Also to a lesser extent Avatar and Transformers Devastation

[3:44:52] <+ALTRNico> they're not blood related Kreygasm
[3:44:54] <+king_of_beggars> Let's not take it off the table.
[3:44:55] <PunishedMercer_> "adopted"
[3:44:57] <%SGrim> It feels weird to say this to my brother, but this is Japan, so we'll Bang Okay?
[3:44:57] <b_ikki> NOT BLOOD RELATED
[3:44:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> brocon confirmed
[3:44:58] <Furious_Dan> Dude, anime. The brother and sister always get together.

[3:45:08] <EynosStyles> I wonder how the male Chara would have responded?
[3:45:09] <derekwst3> find toilet paper
[3:45:10] <Sokumotanaka> Do you shake hands with your childhood romance?
[3:45:11] <ravencloak13> Your blood related.

[3:45:12] <Halospaz117> THEY'RE FUCKING TWINS, OF COURSE THEY'RE BLOOD RELATED
[3:45:13] <dezik45> THEYRE TWINS YOU WEIRDOS
[3:45:17] <iaraCatunda> if you change your skin color hers changes too
[3:45:21] <Karakuioshi> The music Kreygasm
[3:45:21] <MenstrualMunchies> Can you customize your sister?
[3:45:22] <+kuervojones> @Halospaz117 So they are fucking then
[3:45:24] <ravencloak13> *looks at Oriemo*
[3:45:24] <artificiallynatural> They're twins that got adopted
[3:45:24] <%eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Sounds like they might not be apatSmug
[3:45:24] <krksobk> NOT BLOOD RELATED TWINS!
[3:45:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> they are blood related, but not to Max
[3:45:26] <Sokumotanaka> I TOLD YOU
[3:45:31] <Valdorick> There is 100% already porn of them, together, doing the thing.
[3:45:31] <implied_consent> Doesn't beat the folgers incest commercial.
[3:45:32] <iaraCatunda> they are blood related
[3:45:35] <b_ikki> like the incest
[3:45:37] <%SGrim> You call us weirdos, but you're the ones calling them fucking twins. LuL
[3:45:38] <%RubberFistFight> @Halospaz117 @dezik45 ok so it's twincest then?
[3:45:39] <+Fynale> @AngriestPat blade mode is also in this game
[3:45:41] <Kejang> @angriestpat You're twins and you don't know?
[3:45:48] <derekwst3> to much menu
[3:45:51] <PunishedMercer_> the best part of waking up, is incest in your cup.
[3:45:52] <%thunderborn32> well paige and pat are twins so it works
[3:45:55] <ravencloak13> I mean the fucking gloomy girl talks about the TAROT DECK and she calls you the fucking Fool and you have a wild card power essentially.
[3:45:55] <rasamune> Don't be mean! He's doing his best!
[3:45:56] <+Scevda> WOW this is a lot of translation word more than I expected
[3:46:03] <+Scevda> work*
[3:46:12] <pillowwasp> I wish I was a cool police ninja
[3:46:13] <iaraCatunda> they are blood related since her skin color changes as well if you change yours
[3:46:24] <%RubberFistFight> Red Matter? The shit from the JJ Abrams Trekverse that makes magical time-travelling black holes?
[3:46:26] <star_feline> Cool police tutorial ninja
[3:46:31] <derekwst3> @pillowwasp there is still time
[3:46:43] <+Blargimazombie> Wait wait, the map option shows you the map? absurd!
[3:46:44] <ravencloak13> @rubberfistfight Like actually yes given they are from another dimension.
[3:46:53] <rubbishbinge> fully upgraded for EX Baton
[3:46:54] <%AKPC_> that could just be there to fool you @iaraCatunda Kappa
[3:46:55] <%MegboyManuel> does the dad change skin color if you do?
[3:46:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Hey Pat, how's it feel to be pulling a tenth of Max's viewers right now
[3:47:07] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> The more I see, the more I'm convinced Pat was right in Woolie making a Chie
[3:47:09] <star_feline> @GarbageNirvana adopted
[3:47:10] <%TheDullaMAN> You should probably scan everyone with the IRIS
[3:47:10] <%miguelrod777> no dad adopted fater
[3:47:11] <ravencloak13> @megboymanuel No cause he’s your adopted dad.
[3:47:17] <ravencloak13> He picked you up as kids.
[3:47:22] <%MegboyManuel> Daddy no :c
[3:47:28] <dezik45> Pat best Platinum boy.
[3:47:30] <+Scevda> Dads gonna die, no duh
[3:47:31] <star_feline> @GarbageNirvana whoops wrong at
[3:47:48] <ravencloak13> @angriestpat Hey, check what blood types the mascot Lappy.
[3:47:49] <EynosStyles> @ravencloak13 I bet there are a lot of orphans
[3:47:53] <%Laecerelius> the question mark is probalby to let you know that you can ask him questions
[3:47:55] <%miguelrod777> dad killed your real parents when he lost control of his legion calling it now
[3:48:00] <%MegboyManuel> did Pat check the Janitor's size yet
[3:48:00] <+Scevda> Must find dog
[3:48:04] <ravencloak13> There are, the opening cutscene said as much.
[3:48:07] <+maxtheflea> Playing a character action game in co-op seems counter-intuitive to the genre imo. Seems like it would feel bad when people were stealing targets to combo and whatnot.
[3:48:08] <ShinobiPhoenix> @angriestpat Did you change your difficulty to Platinum Standard? if you did, did you notice the "ranks" on Casual are doodle drawings with checkmarks?
[3:48:10] <%dekkitout> Gotta find doggo
[3:48:17] <%thunderborn32> i hope theres a legion thats a pupper
[3:48:19] <gustavozxd> "training room" instantly reminds me of omikron and that one song
[3:48:20] <+Scevda> Her name is Shizu
[3:48:32] <Vigonept> bah nah bananah
[3:48:36] <%MegboyManuel> Alicia size pls
[3:48:37] <EynosStyles> Scan the Dog
[3:48:38] <+Scevda> Back to the Janitor
[3:48:38] <derekwst3> @gustavozxd no
[3:48:42] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @maxtheflea DMC 3 doppleganger

[3:49:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> sick
[3:49:00] <+Scevda> wait no
[3:49:02] <%MegboyManuel> OOOOH
[3:49:07] <TheFilth> can you see people on the john?
[3:49:11] <rasamune> Is there dating? 'Cause I'm gonna date Shizu, if there is
[3:49:11] <artificiallynatural> it's like augmented vision in mgr
[3:49:13] <+Scevda> Gay
[3:49:13] <King9k> Real elevators!?
[3:49:15] <ravencloak13> @maxtheflea I don’t care. The fact they added it means you have the option and you have to learn how to do it.
[3:49:15] <Zombrocom> It's an ACTUAL elevator
[3:49:23] <+maxtheflea> @Sphincter_Spelunker Touche, but I also feel that wasn't very practical or worked very well. Was more gimicky than anythung
[3:49:31] <%thunderborn32> oh boy its that one edgy guy who becomes a villain only later to become a good guy age #304
[3:49:32] <%MegboyManuel> MARIE SIZE
[3:49:33] <implied_consent> I just watched the sears air conditioner commercial.
[3:49:34] <%MegboyManuel> dammit!
[3:49:36] <%Laecerelius> Talk to honkers!
[3:49:40] <ravencloak13> Not to mention people WANTED real co-op in DMC5.
[3:49:42] <%thunderborn32> again*
[3:49:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> I am running my game in the background and played File 1 twice to do Platinum Standard this time and noticed the baby doodles for ranks
[3:50:04] <+Scevda> Hi pink lady

[3:50:26] <+maxtheflea> @ravencloak13 That's true! more power to people that would be interested. Just seems like it defeats the purpose for what character action mans to me anyway (which is being a 1-man styleshow)
[3:50:26] <PunishedMercer_> ugh

[3:50:27] <Zombrocom> LIP SYNCING

[3:50:48] <@lewdskeletor13> This is some good jank

[3:51:05] <Inebriateddonut> are the lips not synced to japanese?
[3:51:05] <JDebss> It's probably synced to japanese guys
[3:51:05] <b_ikki> only professional is you
[3:51:07] <Valdorick> I don't always think I a game should be played in Japanese, but when I do, HOLY SHIT WHAT WAS THE DIRECTOR THINKING!?
[3:51:10] <Karakuioshi> sub > dub Kappa
[3:51:11] <%Niney_Who> Wha-
[3:51:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> so Trish
[3:51:14] <%RubberFistFight> who, Kira buckland?
[3:51:15] <derekwst3> her lip sync must be the work of a enemy stand @AngriestPat
[3:51:16] <+FierceDeityGabe> Where's lady Doppio
[3:51:17] <%dekkitout> Diavola
[3:51:18] <artificiallynatural> adult trish

[3:51:23] <ShichiNoBushi> Rule 63 Diavolo?
[3:51:25] <ravencloak13> @maxtheflea Honestly they did good work with this one since you can juggle between you and your Stand in this game. Like, the real problem is having the enemy have enough health for you to beat on it together.
[3:51:26] <%connos_procrastination> Nah Diavolo is hotter
[3:51:27] <%MegboyManuel> i guess im swapping to japanese now
[3:51:30] <%floralkami> lol, the cast look very bored

[3:51:35] <%Niney_Who> Genderbend Experience Requiem
[3:51:37] <iaraCatunda> diavolo would never be a fckn cop
[3:51:40] <lilmac64> Boy. The idea of Lady Diavolo makes me feel some kinda way.

[3:53:08] <+maxtheflea> @ravencloak13 Super good point. It mostly depends on how balanced the enemies are for more than 1 person to wail on them without them feeling like they are stunlocked until they die. It would be awesome to style on enemies with a friend, It's just a tightrope to walk.

[4:06:10] <krksobk> screw you daddo
[4:06:12] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> She is so dead
[4:06:14] <%thunderborn32> i can't put my finger on a name, but something about this reminds me of the mechanics of an old ps2 game
[4:06:20] <+Scevda> Why can't we name it?
[4:06:21] <Mendin> Your Dad would beat your ass
[4:06:23] <Sokumotanaka> that sounds like a recipe for death
[4:06:23] <+Scevda> Too humanizing?
[4:06:26] <zenith0111> Is this a No-Jo?
[4:06:27] <%DedlokPM> It's called a Stand because it stands next to you
[4:06:36] <haveswordmuststing> @thunderborn32 chaos legion

[4:07:22] <%zamzoph> @AngriestPat becuase Bayonetta?
[4:07:24] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> sega??
[4:07:27] <+CaptainJax> the switch could handle it NO PROBLEM
[4:07:28] <ravencloak13> @eynosstyles That’s why I said we know of.
[4:07:29] <zenith0111> True
[4:07:31] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Persona barely runs on PS3
[4:07:32] <SulfurousAcid> sega?
[4:07:38] <+Scevda> Thats a ton of audio
[4:07:39] <star_feline> Digital
[4:07:43] <Vigonept> fire emblem does it
[4:07:43] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> LUL Switch cant run games
[4:07:44] <Halospaz117> How much Voice Acting is in FE?
[4:07:46] <ravencloak13> Like we don’t know them in the story right now.
[4:07:47] <b1gboss007> hoes mad
[4:07:48] <+kuervojones> Fire Emblem had a lot of voice acting
[4:07:53] <mayorrev> make it download only @angriestpat
[4:07:54] <NiktenKing> Just do P5P
[4:07:54] <%Akanesasusora> p5's only like 20 gigs. I'm sure there are already bigger games on the switch
[4:07:55] <krksobk> B E A S T
[4:07:56] <%RubberFistFight> just super overcompress them like Dark Souls, it's fine Kappa
[4:07:56] <ravencloak13> *looks at Fire Emblem 3 Hourse*
[4:07:59] <cisealnine> My disappointment increases.
[4:07:59] <Halospaz117> Like, isn't ALL of Three Houses Voice Acted?
[4:08:00] <ravencloak13> Houses*
[4:08:00] <+Scevda> SEND YOUR SLAVE TO LABOR
[4:08:01] <Fujiwara_92> NOOOOOOOOO, persona without voice acting?
[4:08:01] <krksobk> CODE 777
[4:08:01] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Doggo Legion

[4:08:03] <Sokumotanaka> YET
[4:08:03] <Mendin> No Friender
[4:08:04] <%dekkitout> Doggo want to play in trash
[4:08:04] <kylejefferies> What If, if you made your Legion to strong, it became the final boss?
[4:08:06] <implied_consent> This game doesn't look...great I mean. It looks decent.
[4:08:09] <Virokwet> huh
[4:08:13] <implied_consent> Graphically
[4:08:13] <noobpsyboticus> dig in the trash like a true police officer
[4:08:15] <%GarbageNirvana> So there are going to be multiple
[4:08:15] <+xBitWolf> How is this a switch game? it looks amazing.
[4:08:20] <+Scevda> @kylejefferies That would be cool
[4:08:21] <ravencloak13> You need to replay missions to get everything.
[4:08:21] <Run44forrest> sega?
[4:08:22] <Mendin> @AngriestPat Could you crawl under that dead end back in the parking garage?
[4:08:25] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Even with all VA in FE 3H, I don't think it comes close to P5.
[4:08:26] <haveswordmuststing> @implied_consent its probably the light novel faces
[4:08:31] <ShichiNoBushi> Bonus objective for throwing away cans.
[4:08:44] <NiktenKing> mouse?
[4:08:46] <%iwishthiswasicq> So when do we get Time Stop?
[4:08:47] <%GarbageNirvana> @xBitWolf Crazy what Switch games can look like when developed with the system's capabilities in mind don't it
[4:08:53] <kylejefferies> Juicy.
[4:08:54] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Let's roll
[4:08:55] <derekwst3> its that ben ten guy

[4:08:56] <Mendin> Meatball
[4:08:57] <SodaMelon> Oh hey, Big Hands
[4:08:58] <zenith0111> The Graphics on Persona 5 are great but not that technically demanding. I heard it was going to be on Ps3 originally
[4:08:58] <Zombrocom> GIANT HANDS!
[4:08:59] <%RubberFistFight> When you mouse over the Red Matter, Spock uses his fancy spaceship to save the Romulans Kappa
[4:09:05] <ravencloak13> @xbitwolf *looks at Breath of the Wild, FE: 3 Houses*
[4:09:06] <GiygasDrillBreak> GORILLA
[4:09:08] <Run44forrest> p5royale better fix the phone group chat dialogue
[4:09:09] <star_feline> Donkey Kong monkaS

[4:09:11] <krksobk> large lad
[4:09:14] <derekwst3> Rolly Gorilla
[4:09:18] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> Though, the fact that The Witcher 3 is coming to the Switch, is insane.
[4:09:20] <%ssjklyco> c
[4:09:23] <%dekkitout> Rollrilla
[4:09:24] <%connos_procrastination> MY BOY HECHATONCHIRES
[4:09:29] <ravencloak13> That straight up looks like the monster from Pacific Rim.
[4:09:32] <ravencloak13> But smaller.
[4:09:32] <%ssjklyco> That's a The world head
[4:09:33] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> NOICE
[4:09:33] <gyro_gogo_zeppeli> Is this Samurai Flamenco?
[4:09:34] <SodaMelon> Okay now I se how this could totally work in Co-Op
[4:09:34] <%Mekhet09> That is where you are wrong @zenith0111 the game barely runs on PS3 and it would be awful on switch.
[4:09:38] <derekwst3> what is that monkey from borderlands games?
[4:09:40] <%velemi> imagine what this looks like to a normal person
[4:09:45] <%MegboyManuel> goddamn this combat is :chefkiss:
[4:09:46] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> super high
[4:09:47] <%RubberFistFight> Wait did you say Briareos? Like from Appleseed?
[4:09:49] <%thunderborn32> im fine with melee legions, but the stun rod seems a little silly against something that big
[4:09:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> WHAT?!
[4:09:51] <Zombrocom> Oh no
[4:09:52] <+Armeggadon> it's so strong it's visible
[4:09:53] <Sulliman34> so how is it

[4:10:04] <Mendin> They just got Hiss'd
[4:10:08] <+Scevda> blam
[4:10:10] <%Mekhet09> Yes it's awful.
[4:10:11] <Run44forrest> i forgot this was on switch. it looks good?
[4:10:13] <ravencloak13> They were also turning into Stands is why they could se it.
[4:10:13] <sellyourselfshort> wasn't this a boss in binary domain?
[4:10:15] <42nfl19> GORILLA! just like the zoologist talked about! @angriestpat
[4:10:20] <pillowwasp> So many dead cops
[4:10:21] <%Mekhet09> There were a lot of concessions made to make it work.
[4:10:21] <derekwst3> they are all becoming another kamen riders
[4:10:24] <%Deano8817> i just got here is pat playing this until 5 am?
[4:10:25] <ravencloak13> @sellyourselfshort Yes. But less armor.
[4:10:37] <ravencloak13> I mean the one from Binary.
[4:10:43] <+Scevda> @42nfl19 Ah, so hes gonna be the "preview" when you talk to him
[4:10:44] <ravencloak13> Also the MindJackers game.
[4:10:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Its a Ghoulrilla
[4:10:45] <metabot64> Is this killer is dead DLC?
[4:10:46] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @Run44forrest It would also look way better on your own tv since streaming really fucks with quality.
[4:10:47] <gustavozxd> @deano8817 he's gonna finish this mission and end the stream
[4:10:48] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @Deano8817 last mission for the night
[4:10:50] <ScreamLord> This thing looks like the big gorilla monster from Dark Sector
[4:10:50] <Run44forrest> anyone else getting parasite eve vibes
[4:10:51] <zenith0111> @mekhet09 Makes sense Witcher 3 for Switch before Persona 5. Sure.
[4:10:56] <%Deano8817> damn
[4:10:56] <%thunderborn32> paige its optimus from beast wars!
[4:11:02] <SulfurousAcid> analyze it to see health
[4:11:06] <+gatoralus> i just finished control on ultra on pc and it looks amazing, and this game still looks amazing graphically to me especially for a switch game
[4:11:07] <kylejefferies> Pat you gotta Dodge the Yaoi hands.
[4:11:09] <EynosStyles> So Chimera are humans. The ones that get dragged back into the Chimera world, become Chimeras.
[4:11:09] <SodaMelon> @metabot64 okay it wasn't just me
[4:11:12] <derekwst3> throw poke cube
[4:11:13] <ravencloak13> Remember you have healing.
[4:11:17] <ZE_Count> Use IRIS PAT!
[4:11:23] <ravencloak13> And can call your Stand back any time.
[4:11:25] <SulfurousAcid> circle it multiple times
[4:11:35] <%GarbageNirvana> @ravencloak13 You think he's going to use a consumable in a Platinum game?

[4:13:20] <implied_consent> @run44forrest Yes
[4:13:20] <%GarbageNirvana> I think it's more the dialogue itself is written awkwardly
[4:13:21] <%RubberFistFight> @ravencloak13 it's pretty close though
[4:13:26] <ravencloak13> Not even close.
[4:13:30] <ursusbearrammage> why do all her voice lines sound like she is on the verge of tears

[4:22:25] <noobpsyboticus> this game looks really nice graphically
[4:22:32] <SodaMelon> Zombie tactics
[4:22:38] <+Scevda> But why turning in the first palce? High "radiation" area? Then why now versus the multiple days/years where it was the same?
[4:22:41] <+CaptainJax> kinda like FF14 primals

[4:23:30] <%thunderborn32> @EynosStyles nice, possibilities then
[4:23:30] <+JohnMarkley> maybe some people are inhgerently more susceptible to being turned than others for some reason?

[4:25:51] <SulfurousAcid> save Emlo!
[4:25:54] <+wah_ha_ha> @AngriestPat Is combat more Nier:A simplistic or has depth like Bayo/DMC?
[4:25:56] <Run44forrest> ELMO
[4:25:56] <+Cryghoul> Screm cat . Jpg
[4:25:59] <Zombrocom> So... you are going to enslave that giant hand and make it your new stand?
[4:26:01] <%cTAKU> you must save the baby
[4:26:03] <KaseKaizer> no
[4:26:03] <+Cloudkiller91> Is it mission based or if you're unlocking a larger map?
[4:26:03] <+ALTRNico> what?
[4:26:06] <krksobk> this is stands
[4:26:07] <%NeroInfinite> This time it is stands
[4:26:10] <ravencloak13> How fucking heavy is that thing that it needs an Arm Stand to lift it?
[4:26:14] <+ALTRNico> yes these are stands
[4:26:15] <luckykae> these are stands
[4:26:15] <SulfurousAcid> this is stands
[4:26:15] <%sshen> Pat isn't gonna be able to wake up for the 1pm stream later
[4:26:15] <+Scevda> Pokemon stands
[4:26:16] <NinJaLeo> STANDO POWAAA
[4:26:17] <krksobk> we stands now
[4:26:18] <+Rodzzila> why does his character design look like shit compared to the rest of the person in the game?
[4:26:20] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> No was saying they weren't Stands
[4:26:21] <%DedlokPM> These are 100% stands
[4:26:22] <ravencloak13> It’s TOTALLY STANDS
[4:26:22] <+Cryghoul> There is a punch rush
[4:26:24] <%Sh00s> Stands Marsh
[4:26:25] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Maybe Personas
[4:26:27] <SulfurousAcid> STANDO TSUKAI
[4:26:28] <derekwst3> OSFrog they look just like us
[4:26:28] <+lordsdb> I'mma lie to myself and think of them as digimon
[4:26:30] <star_feline> They're not because they're not the manifestation of the user :)
[4:26:32] <Sokumotanaka> Nah i disagree persona they're connected by chians
[4:26:34] <%iwishthiswasicq> @rodzzila Because he customized it.
[4:26:35] <+Cryghoul> Normal people cannot see them
[4:26:35] <ShichiNoBushi> Seems closer to Personas or general SMT demons rather than proper stands, though.
[4:26:36] <%dekkitout> One does an Ora barrage for god's sake
[4:26:40] <lilo52> warframes are stands
[4:26:41] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> No one*. fuck I can type
[4:26:45] <%Louie_Salmon> Literally can't be seen by other people and act within a set range
[4:26:46] <Kejang> YOINK
[4:26:47] <rytisone> but they float, not stand Kappa
[4:26:53] <derekwst3> to the shadow realm
[4:26:54] <+ALTRNico> monkaS
[4:26:55] <+Scevda> Cool effect
[4:26:55] <ravencloak13> You can’t see them unless you have one, they have ranges, they have special powers, you can use them to lift you up, and with a weak enough will you can lose them.

[4:32:34] <+Rodzzila> Wait?... He use an item in a platinum game!!!
[4:32:41] <noobpsyboticus> it looks like the stand is more about meter management right now
[4:32:51] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> SICK
[4:32:51] <+Cloudkiller91> I'm torn between this and Daemon x Machina this month and this is making that decision harder to wait on.

[4:33:23] <ravencloak13> It’s also about when to call him back to keep the meter up as high as possible and to avoid attacks.

[4:36:58] <ravencloak13> The dad and sister makes sense but not the other 2. And well, they know the other Chimera’s can return and your Legions are chained Chimera’s.

[4:37:06] <Kejang> Boutta get that ass blow out when everyone survives
[4:37:06] <+Cryghoul> This is some nier music
[4:37:07] <ManfredA> @TetsujinTiger7 yes
[4:37:09] <+CaptainJax> these are the risks we take for science
[4:37:10] <implied_consent> >implying destroying the earth isn't already a part of the campaign
[4:37:10] <KLouDraws> but cool plot tho
[4:37:12] <lokiluko> earth would probably be fine, most native species would be fucked, but the rock would be alright
[4:37:13] <Run44forrest> avdol :(
[4:37:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Uh oh
[4:37:13] <arkv01> oh NO
[4:37:15] <%reonome> uh oh

[4:37:25] <%Faustgesicht> who's defending earth RIGHT NOW?
[4:37:25] <lilo52> oh no it's isekai

[4:37:25] <%cherubs_anonymous> HE CALLED IT
[4:37:26] <+Cryghoul> Now theyre dying
[4:37:27] <+Scevda> Time for the orgy
[4:37:29] <lilmac64> Ride or die together. Being a cop is a lot like being a gangster. Reckless disregard for your life, sycophantic loyalty to your friends, and a healthy disregard for the law.
[4:37:29] <King9k> Credits roll
[4:37:30] <Run44forrest> you were right pat

[4:39:08] <derekwst3> @Mendin cant say that with TMNT on their list
[4:39:08] <+Scevda> Precious antinque medicine
[4:39:17] <+Scevda> ANchored to reality
[4:39:22] <%cvp5127> ??

[4:39:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Just a crime action game with stands?
[4:39:26] <moonmeh> USE THE COPS
[4:39:33] <%connos_procrastination> getting to use your cops
[4:39:33] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it looked a little more grounded in the trailers, maybe?
[4:39:35] <ravencloak13> @firearmsinstructor People have been saying 5 years around that.
[4:39:39] <MenstrualMunchies> the hell is stand
[4:39:49] <+Balkespower> Jojo's Bizarre Noire Rising: Revengeance
[4:39:51] <ravencloak13> Oh, no these were all in the trailers.
[4:39:53] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Star Finger
[4:39:54] <+TopTieramisu> STAR FINGER
[4:39:56] <Hydrapissed> expect more of it to lol
[4:39:58] <+justianxix> The chain is teh best PART
[4:39:59] <ManfredA> to normal cops you basically wave your hand and people can't move
[4:40:00] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> @KlonoaCore JoJo
[4:40:01] <Sulliman34> yeah idk this game just doesnt seem great
[4:40:02] <SulfurousAcid> STAR FINGER
[4:40:03] <RupanSen> extra combat stand applications
[4:40:06] <ravencloak13> The part of the Earth being fucked up and the EVA shit wasn’t.
[4:40:06] <42nfl19> @angriestpat do you think you will break the chain/limiter?
[4:40:08] <suikudo> oh boy indeed
[4:40:09] <+twohitgood> can't wait for woolie to get his hands on this.
[4:40:11] <FirearmsInstructor> @ravencloak13 thanks :)
[4:40:12] <ScreamLord> @KlonoaCore A Fight Ghost
[4:40:13] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> @KlonoaCore Ghost powers
[4:40:23] <derekwst3> These two are now going to be stand users
[4:40:27] <+Rodzzila> @AngriestPat You are a Police with a Stand, how didn't you think this was going to get crazy!
[4:40:31] <ravencloak13> @klonoacore You never watched Jojo’s I take it?
[4:40:33] <%connos_procrastination> CHIMERIFICATION
[4:40:33] <Hydrapissed> Chimerafication
[4:40:33] <arkv01> this soundtrack so far has been amazing
[4:40:35] <+Scevda> chimerification, but WHY
[4:40:35] <roadhog29389> how?
[4:40:37] <+CaptainJax> sounds great Kappa
[4:40:42] <MenstrualMunchies> @ravencloak13 nope
[4:40:43] <Simonator7x> do lawyers get stands in this universe too?
[4:40:44] <%rumtumtugnutz> But where's out?
[4:40:45] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> RED-SHIFT
[4:40:48] <%RubberFistFight> @Sulliman34 it really doesn't. Between the "muscle relaxants and sedatives are fun" voice acting and whatever the fuck the actual plot is doing, it's just... not great.
[4:40:50] <+justianxix> wouldn't it be weird if they had the Jojo manga inside the game world
[4:40:51] <Run44forrest> star platinum got jotaro all that cool shit and beer when he was in jail and jotaro still called it an evil spirit :( :(
[4:40:52] <Kejang> @Scevda fuck you mean
[4:40:54] <%SGrim> Yay back tracking
[4:41:01] <derekwst3> poke cubes
[4:41:03] <ManfredA> Ace Attorney but during the cross examination you're having a stand battle with Edgeworth
[4:41:04] <%King_Wolf_Rigger> The need help from BUCKAROO BONZAI!
[4:41:06] <KLouDraws> angry rubix cubes
[4:41:06] <UrmomIsaBoss25> It's the same composer I believe.
[4:41:07] <+Cryghoul> Okabe
[4:41:08] <%rumtumtugnutz> That's BIG not good
[4:41:12] <%DedlokPM> IT'S A COUPLE RUBIK'S CUBES
[4:41:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> Where's Virgil
[4:41:12] <+gatoralus> this game seems amazing minus the voice acting which is okay lol
[4:41:14] <ravencloak13> @klonoacore What the other person said. It’s a punch ghost but also weird powers. Also Stands after Part 3 are named after music bands and songs.
[4:41:17] <EynosStyles> @angriestpat they are just making the stuff up as they go along.
[4:41:18] <+Scevda> Ah so it is
[4:41:18] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Like in Nier
[4:41:18] <+StrawberryPantsu> THE BLACK SCROLL
[4:41:19] <TheHeroAppears> hmm makes me think of a certain game
[4:41:19] <ShichiNoBushi> Runes or glyphs?
[4:41:20] <Mendin> Astral Chain composer is from Bayonetta 2
[4:41:20] <ScreamLord> Red Scrawl?
[4:41:20] <%connos_procrastination> The red scrawl
[4:41:20] <Simonator7x> law and order, but everyone has stands
[4:41:21] <Gulpunpun> it's the black scrawl
[4:41:21] <LixFury> This is VERY neir
[4:41:22] <42nfl19> OH NO
[4:41:22] <derekwst3> he is a badass
[4:41:22] <RantingRavager> IT'S THE RED-EYE VIRUS
[4:41:23] <%salty_syd913> yea
[4:41:24] <Run44forrest> LUL
[4:41:25] <krksobk> some kind of..... scrawl
[4:41:26] <Hydrapissed> also jins voice actor is abysmal lol
[4:41:26] <IminyourBase> OH NO
[4:41:26] <VERDAXY> oh no bye dad
[4:41:26] <Sulliman34> @RubberFistFight even the gameplay just looks clunky and unfun, which is rare for platinum. feels like they had bigger plans but the combat got reeled in
[4:41:27] <%DedlokPM> In before this is a Nier Spin-Offf
[4:41:28] <%Nina96> TIME FOR DEAD DAD
[4:41:28] <%republicofu> Evil Rubix cubes

[4:41:35] <%DedlokPM> And this is about Red-Eyes
[4:41:38] <lilmac64> @Run44forrest WAIT doesn't Star Platinum have a super short range? Doesn't that mean that all that stuff was like... within a few meters of Jotaro's cell?
[4:41:39] <LixFury> this is Neir 3 isnt it?
[4:41:39] <star_feline> Father son bonding <3
[4:41:40] <VERDAXY> DAD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[4:41:40] <IminyourBase> DON'T KILL YOUR DAD

[4:57:00] <rytisone> litteral slaves
[4:57:03] <%TranquilTurnip> I feel like FF summons would be like this
[4:57:03] <VERDAXY> SLAVES'
[4:57:04] <Valdorick> It would be like if we had the slave trade, but instead of crop fields, they were used to kill their own family back on Africa.
[4:57:07] <Hydrapissed> nahhhh it helped u even when it was red
[4:57:07] <ravencloak13> Yeah, they are from a Stand universe.
[4:57:10] <+Rodzzila> But the Stand doesn't have a fucking chain in their neck!
[4:57:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Stands are an extension of yourself. These Legions are an outside entity that is enslaved.
[4:57:12] <RantingRavager> SLAVE STAND
[4:57:13] <Hydrapissed> and it let u capture it again
[4:57:15] <Us3rr> its basic math

[5:03:27] <%NeroInfinite> pats FF7 streams are big soothing
[5:03:28] <%RubberFistFight> At first you was afraid, you was petrified?
[5:03:29] <Sokumotanaka> @Caidezes we learned from Fallout 4 that making your oc you insert your own personality of whatever in is a bad idea
[5:03:33] <SulfurousAcid> you better be on time or I'll be upset
[5:03:45] <RushUnplugged> apparently it got stupidly high reviews
[5:03:46] <Hydrapissed> gana be poop

[5:04:30] <Kejang> @Caidezes How so? You're the one whining.
[5:04:32] <%RubberFistFight> @Caidezes nah I agree, you're getting pissy about something that's an established institution in JRPGs.

[5:05:26] <%Louie_Salmon> That seems important
[5:05:34] <Ion_Laser> That's cool
[5:05:36] <%Louie_Salmon> It seems really important that it pumps out blood
[5:05:37] <%thunderborn32> scrape your ass and make a kidney
[5:05:38] <%Nina96> PRINT HUMANS
[5:05:43] <Run44forrest> not yet
[5:05:46] <Hydrapissed> ima print a PAT
[5:05:46] <Caidezes> @RubberFistFight Saying I don't like a thing once is getting pissy? Alrighty then. I'll keep that in mind.
[5:05:51] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat it's stem cells. They've figured out how to crudely "specialise" them the way your body does.
[5:05:51] <RupanSen> can I 3D print a bigger penis tho?
[5:06:20] <+DrunkenDice> true enough
[5:06:22] <%RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat there's multiple types of stem cells - pluripotent and totipotent are the two "biggest" ones.
[5:06:22] <Meekest> That sounds fake as shit
[5:06:24] <ShichiNoBushi> Non-stem cells just have blockers on the genes that they are not using.
[5:06:24] <%XeroSigmaPrime> yup, its true but expensive
[5:06:27] <luckykae> yes
[5:06:32] <Run44forrest> pat why are you rubbing stem cells on your legs
[5:06:33] <+allups> PLEASE I NEED STEM CELL
[5:06:34] <42nfl19> i work at a hospital and you can either use your own stemcells or someone elses
[5:06:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> expensive rn, but true
[5:06:37] <arkv01> naw paige the scientists are all lying and their still using aborted babies
[5:06:38] <RantingRavager> 3D PRINT A BIGGER PAT
[5:06:40] <Hydrapissed> can I print a bigger Peen?
[5:06:40] <KasiCrafter> Cool if true.
[5:06:45] <einSynd> It's sorta true, but those stem cells aren't as flexible as the real ones or something
[5:06:47] <tUxUt> show feet cells
[5:06:53] <%Nina96> PRINT PAT WITH HAIR
[5:06:55] <%Mekhet09> People still use fetuses though because it's cheaper.
[5:06:57] <vinceshamwowslap> So 2 pats soon
[5:07:00] <+Zulos77> @Caidezes I agree with you, i wish more Japanese games had voiced protags
[5:07:01] <+CaptainJax> 3D print a smaller pat
[5:07:03] <kvassimoto> Pattrick Requiem PogChamp
[5:07:05] <%thunderborn32> @AngriestPat scientists:stem cells are cool. government: YEA scientists: global warming exists. government: hmm that would cost money sounds like a lie.
[5:07:06] <haveswordmuststing> clone the bigger pat on mars
[5:07:08] <Sokumotanaka> But what about gene splicing? Can I make weird monsters
[5:07:09] <MasterDecoder> This Pat > Bigger Pat
[5:07:11] <Valdorick> Superior Pat*
[5:07:11] <%r_Foeburden87> Alphy
[5:07:12] <Run44forrest> Better Pat PogChamp
[5:07:13] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Is this the plot of Deathstranding?
[5:07:14] <%MagickBurritoh> The bigger Pat will eat the smaller Pat
[5:07:15] <SulfurousAcid> NO YAWNING
[5:07:17] <%ssjklyco> Bigger Pat is only an inch taller
[5:07:23] <KasiCrafter> Bigger Pat? You mean a Pat that's TWOfeet tall? PogChamp
[5:07:29] <Hydrapissed> Peach = caveman
[5:07:32] <RushUnplugged> Paige is BLU, self-destructing
[5:07:32] <%TheSniperJoe> Paige is Songstress.
[5:07:33] <EynosStyles> I can wait for the 3D printing clone movie.
[5:07:35] <Hydrapissed> pat = small thief
[5:07:36] <%TheSniperJoe> Pat is Goblin.
[5:07:41] <%CopperTucker> Patbreaker and Paigestress
[5:07:42] <+CaptainJax> Pat would be Judge
[5:07:43] <%MagickBurritoh> bloodmage
[5:07:44] <ManfredA> so black mage
[5:07:45] <Run44forrest> Bigger Pat has regular sized legs but is somehow shorter
[5:07:45] <%TheSniperJoe> She's a Dark Knight?
[5:07:48] <Mendin> isnt that just dark knight
[5:07:49] <haveswordmuststing> Dark Knight
[5:07:51] <%thunderborn32> oh so how dark knight SHOULD PLAY
[5:07:52] <%TheBlankAce> The glassesless cannon
[5:07:54] <Valdorick> What would make the best Pat, More hair but shorter in stature, or taller, but 0% hair on their body?
[5:07:55] <SulfurousAcid> Tank?
[5:07:59] <%sshen> Pat would be a lala tank then huh
[5:08:05] <%TheSniperJoe> Utsusemi: Pat
[5:08:10] <Run44forrest> paige clone immediately falls apart
[5:08:10] <ShichiNoBushi> Draws aggro like a tank but avoids taking damage.
[5:08:16] <kvassimoto> PogChamp
[5:08:20] <%RubberFistFight> I'm pretty sure that for pluripotent cells you can just put them next to cells of the type you want more of, and they specialise into those cells.
[5:08:20] <Hydrapissed> MAKES sense
[5:08:21] <+azacado> but your slow
[5:08:22] <+CaptainJax> Pat the lalafel
[5:08:23] <Valdorick> Spikey Tanks are fucking awful, just the worst
[5:08:25] <Mendin> You're small but you're a stumbo
[5:08:29] <Run44forrest> thats dumb. just attack someone else
[5:08:30] <%NeroInfinite> ha
[5:08:31] <Wablafarga> sounds like the party would be getting cleaved accidently
[5:08:32] <rytisone> Batmobile in Arkham Knight

[5:08:42] <rubbishbinge> Green mage but not really
[5:08:43] <%thunderborn32> paige is one for all?
[5:08:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Paige is a mitigator tank, she takes the hits, reaches near-death, then heals through it
[5:08:54] <FirewallStorm> glass cannon LUL
[5:08:56] <+DismalDavid> Gotta fix that framerate when you enter IRIS. Astral chain is still dope.
[5:09:11] <Valdorick> Paige is a Brewmaster Monk from WoW, but with McDonalds instead of Beer
[5:09:34] <Run44forrest> pat did you KOREAN VERGIL
[5:09:34] <%sshen> So pat is this now dragon quest in the literal sense?
