[0:19:48] <enby_shout> jesus
[0:19:48] <+braindead6692> Hopes for Parasite eve remake
[0:19:48] <%Sartastic> Kuja
[0:19:49] <%Laecerelius> SEPHIROTH?!
[0:19:49] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Oh God this sucks
[0:19:49] <%TamsynRRD> TamsynRRD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 24 month streak! Hi Pat! I'm home from the hospital after dealing with 104F/40C flu for two weeks! Been loving this RE marathon. I watched a lot of it while sick. CVX is special for me because it was my first, even though it's janky trash.
[0:19:50] <lionandfox21> @warmnoid a man of taste I see
[0:19:50] <ElenaManetta> was that an anime villain
[0:19:51] <CursedNobleman> to be fair, giant leeches look like a decent horror monster
[0:19:52] <%TheMattman1313> OH GOD I FORGOT ABOUT THE BUGS
[0:19:53] <+pectusumbra> Not for nothing but Zero at least had thematics with 4
[0:19:53] <%JJCheeker> This guy looks like a castlevania character
[0:19:53] <+machshop> why would the logo be on the bottom
[0:19:54] <mMayrro> oh no it's reverse sephiroth
[0:19:54] <%ha2ken> What's this Bear Grylls animal combat BS?
[0:19:54] <%bluebiscuit94> Still better than CVX
[0:19:57] <%tank7013> Is that leech Jesus?
[0:19:57] <%TinyLittleDancer> I never got those leeches
[0:19:59] <dreu81> doodLewd REBECCA doodLewd
[0:19:59] <Daikaiju1Sadism> god i love that they remade this game
[0:20:00] <SoaringLettuce> this is some Horror Express shit but worse
[0:20:02] <bugsmr> where would we be without the vagina leeches
[0:20:03] <CursedNobleman> @ElenaManetta Kuja lookin good LUL
[0:20:06] <DSD24> Where's Jill!
[0:20:07] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I've only beaten 1-7 so I'm hyped
[0:20:08] <oniwahoo> Rebecca is great
[0:20:09] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> tip: if a Japanese title has Zero at the end, it means it's a prequel. some ppl forget that
[0:20:10] <TyrantBelial> I feel like
[0:20:11] <%CalderGaming> if this seriously messes you up, do NOT read the manga Bio-Meat: Nectar
[0:20:12] <%peachy996> Enrico is cool
[0:20:12] <%Faustgesicht> Would changing the villain help this game?
[0:20:13] <%cvp5127> how?
[0:20:13] <Daikaiju1Sadism> ayyy
[0:20:15] <+machshop> LUL
[0:20:17] <%ospreyworks> dead eyes
[0:20:20] <%bluebiscuit94> Literally the B-tier characters
[0:20:21] <TyrantBelial> using an existing protag is the worst idea.
[0:20:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you like the underlying gameplay mechanics / concept? (IE dropping items on the ground instead of item boxes, etc?)
[0:20:22] <%Zebroneath> What weird tone they were trying to establish with this series.
[0:20:23] <%TheMattman1313> Was probably the bugs
[0:20:26] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The dub LUL
[0:20:28] <+TDotGoat> why would Wesker do this?
[0:20:29] <%StaceMcGate> All according to keikaku
[0:20:30] <%ha2ken> The helicopter is working for Umbrella.
[0:20:31] <armandolorian> dad is just dead without the E
[0:20:31] <CursedNobleman> MIIIIIIIKE
[0:20:31] <+primax104> all horror genre helicopters come pre sabotaged PAT!
[0:20:33] <%grandark_z317> Wesker was behind it all. a
[0:20:34] <TyrantBelial> Because then the protyagonist isn't scared
[0:20:35] <enby_shout> PATDAB
[0:20:36] <ElenaManetta> has a helicopter ride in RE ever gone from point A to point B uninterrupted
[0:20:36] <@commanderclaw> Albert "BadTouch" Wesker
[0:20:36] <+pectusumbra> Wait does Wesker lust after Rebecca or Jill?
[0:20:38] <%Dementedpenguin> Wesker would never.
[0:20:38] <%zamzoph> SeemsGood
[0:20:39] <Fien111> OH THANK GOD, I'm ONLY A HALF HOUR LATE! Another hour and I would have missed the start of the game!
[0:20:39] <%Sausious> it's ok Pat, clearly it was his plan for her specifically to survive the crash
[0:20:40] <%bigdumbidiotguy> has anyone modded Odie and Garfield into this game yet?
[0:20:40] <%grandark_z317> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:20:40] <%Laecerelius> Wesker was willing to sacrifice EVERYTHING for his ambitions, Pat! Even his underage waifu!
[0:20:42] <oniwahoo> Is Wesker a bigger creepo that Steve?
[0:20:44] <dreu81> Wesker knew that with her sick basketball skills she was sure to survive any mere helicopter crash
[0:20:45] <%draugrix> @angriestpat how could weaker put bees in that helicopter?
[0:20:50] <%peachy996> Wesker lusts for CHRIIIS
[0:20:52] <%cvp5127> @AngriestPat why arent you playing wesker mode?
[0:20:52] <%Dragovus> Wasn't Rebecca in charge of helicopter maintenance?
[0:20:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> "And I never saw him ever again."
[0:20:55] <+machshop> nani

[0:21:14] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> It was dark out.
[0:21:14] <dreu81> WOLF FORCE
[0:21:15] <%Sartastic> dogs ate it

[0:21:39] <punchskeleton> Chris was too busy messaging Leon on twitter to fuck his sister.
[0:21:39] <%Sausious> Umbrella works in mysterious ways

[0:21:45] <oniwahoo> I mean, MPs would absolutely be transporting him
[0:21:45] <%TinyLittleDancer> They were selling convicts to Umbrella
[0:21:45] <Fien111> Are you saying this game doesn't make sense? Are you that daft? That crazy?
[0:21:46] <+machshop> how did they come to that conclusion
[0:21:47] <%peachy996> I love Enrico's big stupid PS1 voice
[0:21:47] <MojoKingIzakku> I bet they were taking billy to the facility to use him for experiments under the guise he did a bad

[0:21:54] <%ha2ken> Key word in horror. SEPARATE.
[0:21:55] <%legendscar01> Yeah separate so yall can die one by one
[0:21:55] <senfood> Rebecca is cute! CUTE!
[0:21:58] <%logoth_> "just following orders" fuck off

[0:22:02] <%grandark_z317> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 This is gonna retcon a lot of shit, isn't it? ...Yeah, it's retconning. Oh no.
[0:22:02] <dreu81> keeeeeyuuut
[0:22:02] <Torgue_1> Not the train, just the murders
[0:22:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @zamzoph FRED YOURE A GENIUS
[0:22:03] <%spongeofmystery> Billy is the cannibal
[0:22:05] <%spongeofmystery> Also bees
[0:22:07] <%StaceMcGate> HE IS THAT BAD PAT
[0:22:08] <%bigdumbidiotguy> cannibal monky
[0:22:12] <Fien111> NO TRAIN, THERE'S NO TIME! ONLY A COMMON MURDERER NOW!
[0:22:12] <nademonkey1100> wtf ever happened to billy
[0:22:13] <%SoFarFetched> What's gotten BIlly so Cannibal
[0:22:15] <%jorniev> maybe! its a spycho killer pat!
[0:22:17] <Daikaiju1Sadism> lost a lot of weight pat!!!!!
[0:22:18] <%TinyLittleDancer> How did a train sneak up on her?
[0:22:18] <TyrantBelial> Billy disappeared.
[0:22:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> monky oo a 🐵🐵🐵
[0:22:22] <Huntercd> None of this makes sense
[0:22:22] <%draugrix> I have a theory that they were umbrella agents taking Billy to the mansion to be a test subject for the tyrant Virus
[0:22:23] <TyrantBelial> after 0
[0:22:23] <+primax104> is that a Sonic Level?
[0:22:24] <+pth88> Jamie pull that train math up
[0:22:26] <mandalor89> its a secret train
[0:22:27] <%Laecerelius> Everyone go out alone in this creepy forest! No time for partnering up for safety!
[0:22:27] <+machshop> jinkies
[0:22:27] <dreu81> i warned you about trains bro
[0:22:28] <TyrantBelial> He is never in anything else./
[0:22:30] <%Sausious> i have several questions
[0:22:30] <%legendscar01> Green hill
[0:22:30] <%ospreyworks> is she a cop?
[0:22:31] <+primax104> Cannibal Murder zone?
[0:22:32] <Snektor> I like cannibal murder zone
[0:22:34] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat I dare you to just go and deconstruct this entire games plot all stream
[0:22:36] <%Dementedpenguin> Is this the train from FF6?
[0:22:36] <Huntercd> I blame Shinji Mikami
[0:22:37] <%honeyman18> cause SHUT UP NERD
[0:22:37] <%chase959> to get the cannibals to the next murder zone
[0:22:38] <TyrantBelial> The train just happened.
[0:22:38] <%bigdumbidiotguy> LE MONKE 🐵🐵🐵
[0:22:39] <%ospreyworks> why does she have a gun?
[0:22:39] <MojoKingIzakku> it's the ghost train for FF6
[0:22:39] <ovan20> @AngriestPat the train also makes noises in the bushes so Rebcca can find it Kappa
[0:22:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but it's MY trash, Pat.
[0:22:40] <Ner234> At least Rebecca's hot tho
[0:22:41] <+machshop> THE DOOR IS SHUT
[0:22:42] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Shit's on a schedule.
[0:22:42] <%peachy996> Already Resident Evil starts to suffer from "Stop stretching out the Raccoon City" events
[0:22:42] <+dayz1003> Is it worse than CVX?
[0:22:43] <+primax104> right next to forest zone
[0:22:43] <punchskeleton> secret cannibal train
[0:22:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HERE WE GO
[0:22:44] <KaseKaizer> but Rebecca BibleThump
[0:22:46] <+Takuatt> but is it at least fun trash unlike CVX
[0:22:46] <+Zutrax> SHUT UP I LIKE IT
[0:22:46] <%spongeofmystery> It's fanfiction
[0:22:47] <dreu81> doodLewd REBECCA doodLewd
[0:22:48] <GameOver_Here> Better than CVX tho
[0:22:48] <+Remery_> you love it, you slut!
[0:22:48] <ElenaManetta> are these still mattes?
[0:22:48] <%Zebroneath> Were both Rebecca and Barry present in RE1 at the same time?
[0:22:50] <kammerdood> Rebecca has good child-bearing hips
[0:22:51] <ElenaManetta> or 3D environments
[0:22:52] <%Laecerelius> The door to safety?! YOU MEAN THE FOREST FULL OF KILLER ZOMBIE DOGS?!?!
[0:22:53] <%legendscar01> @AngriestPat At least its not RE 6
[0:22:53] <IntrepidDolphin> to be fair, most cannibals don
[0:22:54] <TyrantBelial> It happened exactly this night and no ione reported it hadn't arrived yet.
[0:22:54] <+primax104> also rebecca
[0:22:56] <Daikaiju1Sadism> its great pat stfu
[0:22:56] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> usually train > cannibal murderers
[0:22:57] <warmnoid> save room theme is cool at least
[0:22:58] <bugsmr> no better time to dabble in some minor cannibalism than days before your execution
[0:22:58] <%Jay_Squirrel> good thing nothing bad will happen on this train
[0:22:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> change de outfits
[0:22:59] <%Tracazoid> And we haven't even gotten to the magic elevator yet
[0:23:02] <punchskeleton> They'll never find the secret cannibal train in the murder zone
[0:23:03] <oniwahoo> Has any RE game not retconned other games?
[0:23:04] <GameOver_Here> At least its not CVX
[0:23:04] <%Conyst> agreed it is fun trash
[0:23:04] <%JJCheeker> Are you using any mods
[0:23:06] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @kammerdood how about no
[0:23:07] <Fien111> Canoballs rarely attack trains to be honest, and only old and sickly ones at that
[0:23:08] <%chase959> I like trains apatRaffle apatRaffle
[0:23:08] <%ArAechFGC> this game doesn't have an item box?
[0:23:08] <dreu81> Rebecca has good Rebecca-bearing hips Kappa
[0:23:08] <%StaceMcGate> fancy gun
[0:23:09] <%happyface699> Facts
[0:23:09] <%brickwall35> is this the best RE game?
[0:23:11] <switchbladex9> Hey pat will you play re2 remake on the hardest difficulty?also what thing are you looking forward to the most in re3 remake?
[0:23:11] <ElenaManetta> Rebecca's portrait is horrible
[0:23:12] <%legendscar01> CVX is better
[0:23:15] <+Raiden_Breaker> looks better than REmake and that sucks
[0:23:16] <%bigdumbidiotguy> I hated this game when it came out and I hate it now. it's not a terrible game but it's not for me
[0:23:16] <+braindead6692> Dr teenager is on the case
[0:23:21] <%tiaramaki> Wow, the beginning of Shadow Hearts is a lot different than I remember
[0:23:21] <lionandfox21> @ArAechFGC Nope hence why it sucks
[0:23:22] <ovan20> @oniwahoo RE2 only :P
[0:23:25] <%Faustgesicht> the train has a magic elevator?
[0:23:25] <IntrepidDolphin> to be fair, most cannibals dont have the ability to disable a game with leeches
[0:23:28] <RinkuTheFirst> billy too dumb to mix herbs lol
[0:23:29] <%Dragovus> @AngriestPat What stupid costumes do you have?
[0:23:29] <%Conyst> it also has lighting unlike CVX
[0:23:32] <TeethandHunger> Jill and Rebecca where both Weskers wifus, that's why planfus where ruined.
[0:23:33] <%Laecerelius> Dr. Rebecca Houser, MD

[0:23:53] <+Zutrax> Honestly once I got over my irritation of the lack of item box, this game is pretty great. Not as good as RE2, 3, or ReMake, but good.

[0:24:58] <%TinyLittleDancer> She has poor situational awareness for a spec ops person
[0:24:58] <%MayorRev> does this game take place on the train onlyt
[0:24:59] <%trueherobappo> HOW CAN THAT BE?
[0:24:59] <+primax104> so difficulty go down?
[0:24:59] <MojoKingIzakku> rebeecca knows how to shoot to kill

[0:25:13] <Daikaiju1Sadism> you lost a lot of weight man
[0:25:14] <rerun131> Consider me spooked =
[0:25:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @fien111 it was the worst
[0:25:15] <ElenaManetta> nothing scarier than a cakewalk
[0:25:15] <%Punchasaur> Is there a button to make Rebecca pull out her dick like in those sfm futa animations
[0:25:16] <+Takuatt> 2 hr playthrough confirmed
[0:25:17] <lionandfox21> @SoFarFetched Not to begin with if memory serves correctly
[0:25:18] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat Are there Crimsonheads in this one?
[0:25:19] <+PanicSwytch> The first one is the easiest to kill becuz u have to go that way
[0:25:21] <%filialpails> t-Virus? more like Low-T Virus
[0:25:23] <Daikaiju1Sadism> gj
[0:25:23] <LixFury> Jill and Chris are just shit shots Kappa
[0:25:23] <%MelBrooksKA> I can't wait for Pat to math wrong again
[0:25:24] <SoaringLettuce> "Easy mode does not need unlocking"
[0:25:26] <warmnoid> trueherobappo nope
[0:25:26] <Renuarb> @AngriestPat To be fair, the first zombie room in the game has you surrounded. They probably didn't want the player to fucking DIE so fast
[0:25:28] <Fien111> @BallerSwagBro9k It was an RE CG movie
[0:25:28] <dreu81> the game is just giving you a false sense of security before unleashing eliminators on you
[0:25:30] <JoelFleran> its those basketball skills i tell you
[0:25:30] <oniwahoo> Yeah, like the first enemy in RE1, you do not even have to fight it :p
[0:25:32] <%honeyman18> is that the easiest zombie kill?
[0:25:34] <%Taisuru> He's saying the problem is that it undermines the zombies being a threat, like they were in REmake
[0:25:35] <%SoFarFetched> @lionandfox21 odd that it doesn't do that when RE1remake did it
[0:25:35] <%ha2ken> Crazy Talk will have his moment today. apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead apatDab
[0:25:40] <%Laecerelius> The cake for the cakewalk might be an expired cheesecake! We gotta warn Woolie!
[0:25:41] <%trueherobappo> @warmnoid Thanks @AngriestPat
[0:25:41] <+SlappyMeats> yeah it takes a few hours for zombies to harden, so the ones at the mansion are much stronger :)
[0:25:53] <%SoFarFetched> YOU GET CRABGS
[0:25:54] <rytisone> Crimson Heads are Remake exclusive
[0:25:55] <%SoFarFetched> CRABS*
[0:25:57] <person181> like a shellfish?
[0:25:57] <%xxinevitablexii> are the radios pre-broken in this?
[0:25:59] <%spongeofmystery> mutant crabs
[0:26:01] <+Zedkan> BRAB VIRUS

[0:26:27] <%Dementedpenguin> I've never seen this game past the stupid opening slug/train cutscene. This should be interesting.
[0:26:31] <%honeyman18> crusty Krab Zombies
[0:26:33] <@absolute_weapon> @angriestpat this means Rebecca was more capable in her first combat encounter then Jill
[0:26:33] <+SlappyMeats> WHAT IS THE HEAD?
[0:26:34] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Why did you find this so easily isn't this supposed to be confidential
[0:26:34] <Tubit> etalCrab
[0:26:35] <%spongeofmystery> This kills the crab
[0:26:35] <lionandfox21> @SoFarFetched It is and I think its why its such a weird game aside from the obvious lack of item box, though it was probably done to encourage even play between Billy and Rebecca
[0:26:37] <ElenaManetta> god this text is structured awful. it's spaced like a haiku
[0:26:37] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Zombies move faster in this than in REmake and Rebecca cant take hits at all. They are still a threat
[0:26:38] <UncleMcgoo> Umbrella secrets on random train
[0:26:41] <%tiaramaki> Time for crab
[0:26:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @laecerelius Finally a weapon to SURPASS METAL GEAR

[0:29:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @machshop 18 bro
[0:29:17] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY DID THEY REMOVE ITEM BOXES
[0:29:18] <%grandark_z317> @thatoneguyyousaw Don't ask questions.
[0:29:21] <haidanort> it does not
[0:29:21] <%SoFarFetched> well kinda I guess LUL
[0:29:21] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Do you like this item handling or the "magic item box" better?
[0:29:26] <OrphixPride> i loved that you could drop shit on the floor in this game actually
[0:29:27] <%templar010> goblins
[0:29:34] <%Sartastic> it's fun sorting thru the mess on the floor
[0:29:34] <%Laecerelius> Just throw it on the ground! You're not a part of this system! You're an adult!
[0:29:37] <OrphixPride> just pick a room to be your new item box LUL
[0:29:37] <%grandark_z317> apatHoldon They removed ITEM BOXES!?
[0:29:38] <+SlappyMeats> item boxes aren't around because Wesker hadn't finished casting the spell yet
[0:29:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @monkeyweed21 Because Nanomachines
[0:29:39] <%bigdumbidiotguy> GIVE ME ITEM BOX OR GIVE ME DEATH
[0:29:43] <%bluebiscuit94> how is rebecca a cop actually? isnt she a high achooler?
[0:29:44] <GameOver_Here> Is there a mod for an item box?
[0:29:45] <%legendscar01> Run pat nothing gonna happen
[0:29:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> best advice I can give it to designate your "hub" areas for dropping stuff off
[0:29:50] <%spongeofmystery> Mais pourquoi?
[0:29:52] <rytisone> a hot guy
[0:29:54] <haidanort> come on pat, they're just doing the same thing you've been doing for years
[0:29:54] <%TinyLittleDancer> Let's be honest, "magic item boxes" were a dirty crutch
[0:29:57] <warmnoid> no item box, so most players just dump all their shit in the nearest save room instead
[0:29:57] <%grandark_z317> @bluebiscuit94 Summer Job.
[0:30:02] <nademonkey1100> pat and his uncanny ability of finding that one wrong guy

[0:33:42] <%Bane_Kaikyo> RIPCheer500 Potentially controversial opinion: I think RE6 was a good game. Perhaps not a good RE game in terms of tone and plot or whatever, drops horror entirely in favor of big flesh blobs to shoot guns at. BUT as an action shooty co-op game it's very fun, handles well, and goofy enough when playing co-op to always be a blast.... I might be biased cause I played all the campaigns with my cousin and really enjoyed it, but I maintain that in a vacuum it's a fun ass game. Thoughts?

[0:45:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 45m 46s.
[0:45:48] <+chunkymonkey737> what a train!
[0:45:50] <%legendscar01> And definitely not Resident evil 2
[0:45:50] <$joylent_blue> most things aren't as good as REmake
[0:45:51] <lionandfox21> ITS FUCKING BORING IS WHAT IT IS
[0:45:52] <%trueherobappo> @AngriestPat But does that mean it gets betteR?
[0:45:52] <%bluebiscuit94> Better than CVX?
[0:45:52] <+Saintsinhell24> Really bad bosses too
[0:45:54] <%Mekhet09> You should have played this before remake.
[0:45:55] <dukenux> Then again, what is?
[0:45:56] <%SixxMakaveli> it's no CVX
[0:46:00] <%TinyLittleDancer> Sometimes I feel like you would rather play the same two games on repeat
[0:46:03] <$Grimlockfly> It’s go slugs
[0:46:04] <%Aydarkzero> LUL
[0:46:07] <Spawntaneous501> Remember pat saying this as he gets to the Monkies again

[0:46:11] <person181> it's all up hill from here
[0:46:15] <CloniiCory> @CrimsonCore90 Considering the images I've seen of Rebecca, I'd say yes.

[0:46:29] <SMuffinMan> But it is better tan CVX
[0:46:31] <%legendscar01> Abandon her like Ashley Pat
[0:46:32] <Fien111> That train is fucking BOOKING it
[0:46:36] <+reycharles75> at least this game has magic elevators
[0:46:38] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> The chad crouch walk
[0:46:41] <dukenux> Goo god

[0:47:01] <Fien111> the Anti-ME1 Elevator?
[0:47:03] <JackalKing> Even more magical than Dark Souls 2?
[0:47:05] <ShichiNoBushi> More magical than Willie Wankah's?
[0:47:06] <%Jekado> does the train have an elevator?
[0:47:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Rebecca is moe Billy is hot
[0:47:08] <+brightman42> more magical than the wonkavator?
[0:47:09] <%JJCheeker> This train is pretty tall
[0:47:09] <+chunkymonkey737> KappaPride
[0:47:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger hey man. Not much, you?

[0:47:11] <dukenux> elevator on a moving train LUL
[0:47:11] <%XeroSigmaPrime> The effects of everything shaking in the backrounds looks AMAZING
[0:47:15] <jadefox33445> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[0:47:15] <DSD24> Reading Rainbow DMX
[0:47:15] <%legendscar01> Pat looks miserable LUL
[0:47:16] <%Dementedpenguin> Who said that?
[0:47:17] <%tiaramaki> I've never seen nor played this game yet, so I can't wait to see how bad this is
[0:47:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No Pat .....NO
[0:47:19] <%TaphexWin> Billy easy
[0:47:22] <%Conyst> It's no Upsy you're lifting friend
[0:47:23] <invisi_bliss> Same old Shit
[0:47:24] <%spongeofmystery> Rebecca, but only just
[0:47:24] <rytisone> and in the end Rebecca and Billy walk all the way to where the original mansion is
[0:47:25] <%dheng1> I can’t decide what’s more gorgeous billy or the background
[0:47:25] <dukenux> Survive, Pat
[0:47:26] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> For me its Billy
[0:47:30] <nademonkey1100> should have played this after cvx
[0:47:31] <%Mekhet09> Don't let it set in.
[0:47:32] <%JJCheeker> Hey it's the only scary part in the game
[0:47:33] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat at risk
[0:47:36] <daisyyyy> Id let Billy fuck me
[0:47:38] <dukenux> Because fuck you
[0:47:38] <+Shockrates20XX> how does each character magically know what the other is doing?
[0:47:39] <+reycharles75> at least its shorter than re6
[0:47:42] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> I just started RE6 again a few nights ago. It's so fucking TEDIOUS
[0:47:44] <lionandfox21> Billy is a Queen fan so I'm gonna say yeah to him
[0:47:46] <%startstoprepeat> it'd be better if one of billy's character traits was that he couldn't read
[0:47:47] <ZazzyDoesStuff> You should have played the on rails shooter version of this game with woolie. Maybe one and a half streams for the whole thing and it would have been way more enjoyable.
[0:47:48] <cn_monoxide> Because you reconnected the power dummy
[0:47:50] <Heartless_01> rebecca all the way. even wesker thinks so
[0:47:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> the key was rebeccas death
[0:47:57] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Headgaskets blew and my truck's engine got roasted. Other than that, I'm vertical and breathing.
[0:48:00] <%TaphexWin> GAMEPLAY
[0:48:03] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Why would you trust Wesker
[0:48:06] <%bigdumbidiotguy> where are all the mOnsters
[0:48:08] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @shockrates20xx walkie talkie
[0:48:09] <%Jane_Lo> @Shockrates20XX they have a radio i think?
[0:48:12] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger you safe?
[0:48:13] <DSD24> But Billy was in the military you had to read
[0:48:14] <+SlappyMeats> that little dumbwaiter makes such space tech noises
[0:48:18] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like da Wesker mode tho
[0:48:20] <%xxinevitablexii> put rebeccah in there
[0:48:22] <person181> is this zapping?
[0:48:25] <%legendscar01> Sheva is better
[0:48:27] <rytisone> send him a love letter
[0:48:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Wesker used Death Stare!
[0:48:31] <%StaceMcGate> I don't think Pat is gonna finish this game...
[0:48:37] <+Takuatt> RE0 confirmed for GTAV rip off
[0:48:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> I love how Pat resents the fact that he's playing this game.
[0:48:38] <+OwlLightningMage> The true power of the Zapping system
[0:48:39] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> Billeh and Rebaccah
[0:48:39] <+brightman42> it's zipping
[0:48:40] <%Aydarkzero> no he's ready!
[0:48:41] <corepercentlives> it's been only few minutes and look at poor pat
[0:48:44] <ShichiNoBushi> The Clapping System™
[0:48:44] <%JJCheeker> He's got cool jeans
[0:48:44] <dukenux> New and IMPROVED Zapping System
[0:48:46] <%peachy996> Billy sucks, Pat
[0:48:50] <%tiaramaki> That's such an awful way to hold the gun LUL
[0:48:50] <%Kuro_Koshka> Kuro_Koshka subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! So now that you're deep in the goo, do you still hate CVX more than RE0? :v
[0:48:51] <+Raiden_Breaker> how was the loading in the original Gamecube release when switching?
[0:48:52] <@commanderclaw> And the tat
[0:48:53] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Send her a pic of your Samurai Edge, Billy
[0:48:54] <%bigdumbidiotguy> can we get some call of duty game play or some fortnite please this game sucks dickus
[0:48:54] <JoelFleran> its just more work
[0:48:55] <%trueherobappo> Or his tattoos

[0:48:55] <%legendscar01> And the Tribal tattoo
[0:48:58] <DjFrostBite95> BADMAN

[0:48:59] <oniwahoo> I really don't like Billy
[0:49:00] <+Ell1ot> he's so naughty
[0:49:00] <+PanicSwytch> NAUGHTY
[0:49:02] <lionandfox21> He's such a bad Marine
[0:49:02] <%TwinBat> pat goes sploosh
[0:49:05] <$Grimlockfly> So much standing and loading
[0:49:05] <%Laecerelius> Billy is actually a part of Bridges, Pat
[0:49:06] <bugsmr> military trained
[0:49:06] <DSD24> Billy would look better without the dumb tattoo
[0:49:10] <%SomeSageAdvice> that was some really neat looking water
[0:49:10] <rytisone> Bad Boy for Life
[0:49:10] <Fien111> Pat going a bit Letterkenny there
[0:49:11] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> calebSM
[0:49:13] <+SlappyMeats> he looks like he intends to axehandle smash zombies with the gun
[0:49:14] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah. Just having to deal with junking my rig and looking for something else. At least Pat is streaming so I can be angry at something else lol
[0:49:15] <+brightman42> he needs to put the other cuff on the same wrist so he can't get stuck on shit
[0:49:15] <%Sartastic> bad "murder 20 ppl" boy
[0:49:16] <+CaptainTeembro> This isn't Temtem D:
[0:49:16] <GameOver_Here> Cause Billy is a bastardman
[0:49:18] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Can he break those cuffs?
[0:49:18] <%dheng1> Bad and buff
[0:49:26] <%peachy996> And you know what's a great name for your bad boy character: Billy
[0:49:27] <%Conyst> Still about 50 times better than Steve
[0:49:29] <fairore> @dsd24 nah DansGame
[0:49:31] <%peachy996> Billy Bitchcakes
[0:49:31] <%legendscar01> They shoot so slow
[0:49:32] <%TinyLittleDancer> Holding a gun high and close is kinda OK for close quarters
[0:49:32] <Ghost__Pantsu> His tat looks like it was done with a sharpie
[0:49:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Billy straggled 7 orphans while their parents watched in horror and arousal.
[0:49:37] <%TaphexWin> 50? try a thousand
[0:49:37] <%bigdumbidiotguy> this game is for b00mers
[0:49:38] <%ospreyworks> Rebecca looked better with the hat.
[0:49:40] <+RowenCleric> why is rebeccas gun better
[0:49:40] <42nfl19> You call that a monster? I'll show you a monster...GUN

[0:50:16] <%Dementedpenguin> ????
[0:50:17] <%TaphexWin> Can RE8 just be a partner game between Steve and Billy so Billy can just beat the shit out of him?
[0:50:17] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_Wolf_Rigger yeah my dad's transmission just shit the bed and a bunch of other things. Had to figure out how to get another vehicle for him a few weeks ago. I get it. Sucks. Hope you can get something else reliable and affordable soon. :)
[0:50:18] <+Takuatt> oh god I just realised since this is a train the map only be a straight line. what a fucking shitshow
[0:50:19] <+PanicSwytch> This and one other place has respawning zombies

[0:50:20] <%bigdumbidiotguy> Billy can take 15 hits from an eliminator
[0:50:21] <+CaptainTeembro> This isn't Temtem D:
[0:50:26] <daisyyyy> Billy is the kind of moral asshole that he doesnt want to break the cuffs
[0:50:31] <+Pendragwn> @AngriestPat How do you resist screaming out action movie quips while playing this game
[0:50:32] <Tubit> These train cars are wide as fuck

[0:51:33] <+Takuatt> i wish this game was a brief case huehuehue
[0:51:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @FirearmsInstructor Thanks. Same to you and your dad. I've got a pair of transmissions for Ford trucks if that's what you need lol
[0:51:35] <%LunarRemix> He should just bash the zombos with his gun
[0:51:38] <+LegendaryDorkKnight> calebJ1 calebJ calebJ3
[0:51:39] <%xxinevitablexii> Can Billy even Read?
[0:51:39] <%chronotriggerhappy123> chronotriggerhappy123 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! I'd like to think Rebecca is writing a dear diary when you aren't controlling her
[0:51:39] <GameOver_Here> Dumb science bitch couldn't even make Billy more smarter.
[0:51:41] <DracaenaLeaf> itcy tasty
[0:51:42] <%JJCheeker> I forget what are the extra outfits for this game
[0:51:45] <%GarbageNirvana> So did they have two different teams on this and REmake
[0:51:52] <%SoFarFetched> "That crazy elmo,WHY'D HE BITE ME!?!?"

[0:52:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CaptainTeembro You know Temtem's prequel. In order to escape the T virus humanity made flying islands but a different version of the T virus took hold of the wildlife and now the last immune survivors use the T virus monsters to attack other monsters
[0:52:13] <%tank7013> This is one hell of a train

[0:59:57] <DSD24> RE6 has cool combos
[0:59:58] <+Raiden_Breaker> zombies are barely here
[1:00:00] <%Jane_Lo> @MayorRev because re ZERO, everything has to be a prototype

[1:00:06] <cookie_luck_> Hey, pat's playing an RE game

[1:01:11] <SoaringLettuce> I dunno, I played re4 recently and there were times I wished I could drop shit to pick up important shit, use it and go back
[1:01:11] <+BionoidLCR> @CloniiCory wrong its cv
[1:01:15] <DSD24> What about that weird RE first person game on PS1
[1:01:16] <+Shockrates20XX> Okay let's just skip to RE4.
[1:01:22] <trainedtarget> Can't wait for the RE 0 Remake so I can play a good version of this game
[1:01:24] <%legendscar01> RE4
[1:01:26] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat loves this game
[1:01:27] <%peachy996> Lol
[1:01:28] <%Varlinator> this is the RE I probably know the absolute least about
[1:01:28] <%InugamiTheHound> is re zero or CVX is worst?
[1:01:28] <lionandfox21> LOVE IT
[1:01:28] <+Rolandknight> will you stop your giving me a headache with how you talking about this crap game.
[1:01:29] <theaterunderground> ahh i made it
[1:01:29] <%tigerfang86> yeah but RE4 THO
[1:01:29] <nepneptech> Rebecca use this stab the zombies
[1:01:29] <+machshop> it's smooth sailing from here bro
[1:01:32] <%SilverFaustX> thats just soo obtuse...
[1:01:33] <%bluebiscuit94> U did this to YOURSELF
[1:01:35] <%spongeofmystery> No shut up this is legit a really good idea
[1:01:36] <%peachy996> You've still got RE6 to go
[1:01:36] <Fujiwara_92> nah, re0 is fine
[1:01:37] <shotgang86> You when you playing RE4?
[1:01:38] <%MelBrooksKA> RE was a mistake
[1:01:38] <%Mekhet09> If you didn't know the game how the fuck would you get through this shit blind?
[1:01:41] <%dheng1> This or cvx?
[1:01:43] <%Taisuru> When RE0make
[1:01:45] <%TaphexWin> We only have two bad RE games left
[1:01:46] <+machshop> RE4 is after this
[1:01:46] <Xenokhrist> after CVX and this RE4 is gonna feel like the biggest relief nut ever
[1:01:47] <%bread_assassin> Hey man, I voted for KOTOR 2.
[1:01:49] <%dheng1> Which is worse
[1:01:49] <ElemeNtxt> Ireally wanna see RE 6
[1:01:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat wants to bitch at this game for stealing food of his plate and marry it
[1:01:53] <whispersfromthedale> The footsteps are a lot quieter compared to other RE games
[1:01:53] <+Raiden_Breaker> we did CVX this is noting, at least this looks nice
[1:01:55] <lionandfox21> Thats dumb
[1:01:58] <trainedtarget> Pat, have you ever played the Resident Evil Card game?
[1:02:00] <%legendscar01> At least its now RE 6
[1:02:01] <+BionoidLCR> @dheng1 cvx is just fucking boring
[1:02:02] <Ghost__Pantsu> RE 6 is going to be so good tho lobosLULN
[1:02:06] <%SoFarFetched> and hES FLAMING
[1:02:06] <Ghost__Pantsu> For us at least
[1:02:08] <%peachy996> Pat you have to play RE6 because I never played RE6
[1:02:13] <trainedtarget> Or the Resident Evil 2 Board game from recently?
[1:02:14] <lionandfox21> Leave him like his father left him
[1:02:16] <%Jane_Lo> @Mekhet09 well, with that saying, you can say this about any RE
[1:02:18] <%Taisuru> Extra crispy zombo
[1:02:19] <ZazzyDoesStuff> Last Time I'll say it this stream. The Lasrgun/On-Rails shooter version of this game is way more fun than this one.
[1:02:20] <+OwlLightningMage> He's literally flaming for Billy dick
[1:02:23] <%TaphexWin> YES THE HEAD NODS
[1:02:23] <rytisone> kiss him already

[1:02:28] <Fujiwara_92> yep

[1:03:26] <%SoFarFetched> @FirearmsInstructor This game has no Item box at all. But somehow thinks making up for it by letting you drop items anywhere and seeing it on the map will help.

[1:17:11] <%Aydarkzero> Wesker & Birkin being lame on a Friday LUL
[1:17:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> They could replace it in the REMAKE
[1:17:17] <%MelBrooksKA> That went well
[1:17:18] <%patriotrenegade> @AngriestPat Are the leeches worse than the albinoid
[1:17:18] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> why was REmake`s Wesker a different va?
[1:17:19] <%valriot> BILLIAM BARKEN, AND ABBY WHISKERS
[1:17:19] <%peachy996> Yeah but I like that Billy Birkin and Alby Wesker are best buds
[1:17:21] <%dheng1> This is what wesker does on Friday’s
[1:17:26] <%KusoDM> Who's a better convict protagonist, BILLY or the guy from Silent Hill Downcoming
[1:17:28] <%Typhaeon> Leeches vs armor men, what a mismatch
[1:17:32] <%Dragovus> William knows Albert is hotter than Annette
[1:17:33] <Fien111> But don't take their guns....no...
[1:17:36] <+Angry_Ed> I love how Wesker is apparently a scientist like Birkin but he's Johnny Bravo and Birkin's a FUCKING NERD
[1:17:41] <%StaceMcGate> Alone on a Friday night? Just remember these Yakuzies
[1:17:43] <%draugrix> @trueherobappo the undead adventure of beelee and bhekey

[1:17:55] <%trueherobappo> @StaceMcGate YESSSS
[1:17:56] <%peachy996> @KusoDM No one in Downcoming tries to pretend Murphy is cool so Billy is worse
[1:17:56] <dukenux> BSOD
[1:17:57] <%MelBrooksKA> Time to fail at math
[1:17:57] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Gallhint) (warning)
[1:17:57] <%KusoDM> Cumdemned: Cumshot

[1:18:06] <Ner234> MY TRAINS DO PLEB
[1:18:07] <%natebud> But Murphy doesn't have sweet tribal tats
[1:18:08] <TyrantBelial> I can't get over the fact that Birkin and Wesker just hang out together every saturday night.
[1:18:08] <JoelFleran> train is big hurt
[1:18:09] <jinking79> Wesker and Barken watchin Horse porn again
[1:18:09] <%Typhaeon> What a dumb tattoo

[1:18:26] <CloniiCory> @Angry_Ed I doubt his doctorate is legit. Wesker probably wrote it up with crayola markers and glitter.
[1:18:26] <+Jokobeast> Engage front brakes only.
[1:18:27] <%RubberFistFight> K O E D

[1:18:37] <JoelFleran> at least the whipers work
[1:18:37] <%kolmolgorov> umbrella trains do
[1:18:37] <+Yakobro> Billy designed the brakes.
[1:18:38] <%StaceMcGate> Umbrella trains were designed by the same architect
[1:18:39] <%natebud> Solve this puzzle to not crash
[1:18:39] <%radda343> no shut up you gotta have a card and shit because umbrella fuckin whatever
[1:18:39] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> BILLY

[1:18:53] <%Tearonex> @AngriestPat Umberlla trains work like that Pat
[1:18:54] <%trueherobappo> SAY THE NAME RIGHT
[1:18:54] <%SpcOpsBear> Because the first AND last car are BOTH engine cars. It's a train that goes two ways on one track without changing tracks.
[1:18:54] <GustauveVIII> its pretty hard to connect controls from the front OF THE GODDAMN TRAIN TO THE BACK
[1:18:55] <%KusoDM> BECKY PUMP DA BREAKS
[1:18:55] <%natebud> Solve this slide block puzzle to use the brakes
[1:18:56] <%TinyLittleDancer> Each car has its own manual brakes pat
[1:18:57] <dreu81> REBECCA STOP BEING SO PRETTY ITS DISTRACTING
[1:18:57] <%trueherobappo> It's Becky
[1:18:58] <majindusto> Reba
[1:19:00] <BalloniWright> It's the HYPE TRAIN atpMurray
[1:19:03] <ittla> and the only reason they skid is because lack of friction from metal on metal
[1:19:04] <%SoFarFetched> ITEM BOX STAY
[1:19:04] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> Yeah leave the big dumb murderer in charge of stopping th complicated machinery

[1:19:16] <%miakhalifaisoverrated> Repeating something over and over is comedy!
[1:19:17] <%Aydarkzero> Pat has officially lost it
[1:19:18] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Bullshit, Billy ain't afraid of no man.
[1:19:18] <%dheng1> Billy
[1:19:18] <$joylent_blue> be Billy, careful
[1:19:19] <ZazzyDoesStuff> most trains do actually have emergency brakes at the rear of the train.
[1:19:23] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> BE CAREFUL I NEED YOUR DICK
[1:19:23] <%kolmolgorov> this is what happens when you go from making chemical weapons go designing trains
[1:19:23] <Cynical2DD> Where can I get some Rebecca r34?
[1:19:25] <cardboard_boxy> Billy is Trains
[1:19:27] <narusao> do beautiful D:
[1:19:28] <BoozamusPrime> Rebecamus prime must stay behind
[1:19:28] <dukenux> Brakes start with B which is Billi too
[1:19:28] <%tigerfang86> ECLEPTIC EXPRESS
[1:19:28] <+Angry_Ed> b r a k e s y s t e m
[1:19:29] <%tiaramaki> I thought it said "Epileptic Express" on the card
[1:19:30] <StromkoPenguin> I'm not sure Ecliptic is a word
[1:19:30] <theaterunderground> that card looks terrible
[1:19:31] <%RubberFistFight> "careful" starts with C which is one letter away from B, which is what BILLEYH starts with!
[1:19:31] <%natebud> Use your three keycards and solve this slideblock puzzle to stop the train
[1:19:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Be Beautiful Billy.
[1:19:34] <daisyyyy> Billy cant remember that
[1:19:35] <%StaceMcGate> Billy has the same meaning as Smurf now
[1:19:36] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> oh hey, the game is almost over
[1:19:37] <+OwlLightningMage> That card is sexy
[1:19:37] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> ECLIPTIC EXPRESS??
[1:19:37] <ittla> imagine needing a card key at both ends of the train just to make it slow down
[1:19:40] <%MelBrooksKA> @Cynical2DD Google?
[1:19:42] <%dheng1> Stay sexy billy
[1:19:43] <%tank7013> The music ain't bad at least
[1:19:44] <Fien111> Pat I fucking beg you to make no further B noises for at least a god damn week.
[1:19:45] <cardboard_boxy> @theaterunderground no u
[1:19:45] <%JJCheeker> The self destruct sequence has been activated
[1:19:46] <%Typhaeon> Byleth sounds like Billy
[1:19:46] <%godzookylives> Billiam
[1:19:47] <%KusoDM> R34 can be found at rule 34
[1:19:48] <%Valdorick> We Billy it Billy
[1:19:48] <+Angry_Ed> Ecliptic is a word but it's like...astronomy-related
[1:19:48] <dukenux> WE DO IT
[1:19:50] <%trueherobappo> "don't worry becky, I'll be back for that box soon."
[1:19:50] <%Darren716> Elciptic Express is a strong name for a train
[1:19:53] <SoaringLettuce> good thing we stopped calling minh billy
[1:19:53] <Proeaten> You get a bonus cutscene if you send Rebecca to the back, she meets zombie edward and is all “oh no edward”
[1:19:56] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> Wow we're already at the end of the game? Kappa
[1:19:57] <%Typhaeon> Billy confirmed for Smash and Fire Emblem

[1:20:02] <ODSTEvan147> Sup nerds
[1:20:04] <%RubberFistFight> hahah just imagine this as Billy's internal monologue/narration of his life.

[1:20:15] <KaseKaizer> WR PogChamp
[1:20:15] <bugsmr> billy is unbreakable
[1:20:17] <%takokasa> Oh no! A zombie!
[1:20:20] <%patriotrenegade> this is so dull
[1:20:21] <%TamsynRRD> Train brakes are usually controlled from the engines which are at the front and back. THere's nothing unusual about that.
[1:20:22] <%draugrix> apatBig HERO BEELEE
[1:20:26] <trainedtarget> Didn't send Rebecca for the extra cutscene
[1:20:28] <%KusoDM> Billy is Billy

[1:20:45] <%StaceMcGate> Billy....could go... all.... THE.... WAY
[1:20:47] <+Angry_Ed> Indubitibilly
[1:20:48] <%trueherobappo> Billy needs to be more Billigent
[1:20:49] <%Darren716> Oh man i just remembered all the dumb costumes in this game
[1:20:52] <+Remery_> @l_a_s_e_r_m_a_n ofcourse
[1:20:52] <whispersfromthedale> The zombies don't give a lot of feedback when they are shot
[1:20:57] <%JJCheeker> actually it's 2 sets of twins

[1:21:06] <%StaceMcGate> The Zombos bite Billy's tattoo
[1:21:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Fuck them Billy
[1:21:12] <%AmericanaRed> RELOAD SAVE
[1:21:19] <CloniiCory> There was a sale at the gap Pat, and those zombies just had to have that specific look
[1:21:21] <%dheng1> My nips are so hard from the intensity
[1:21:21] <+PanicSwytch> Dude u can beat this whole segment using waaaaay less ammo
[1:21:25] <shotgang86> apatDab
[1:21:26] <senfood> Did he just pass a shotgun on the ground?

[1:33:20] <%Townspoon> ohhhhh eat pets like boogie
[1:33:23] <bugsmr> pat wtf
[1:33:23] <%TamsynRRD> @TinyLittleDancer It's well controlled for the most part. THis is the first time in about 15 years that I've been in the hospital for something.
[1:33:24] <try_it_sis_> BITE THAT KITTY, PAT!!!!! BITE IT REAL HARD!!!!!!!!!
[1:33:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight Yeah. It happened when I was about 6, and the doctor on the phone said they needed to drop the tempurature at home because I'd probably not make it through an ambulance ride. My four bottom adult front teeth came in with nearly no enamel. I got lucky.
[1:33:26] <%TinyLittleDancer> Also, 40C fever isn't necessarily an emergency ... it really depends for how long and how well you're doing. I would still throw some Tylenol at it and maybe ice packs for comfort
[1:33:27] <Cynical2DD> Did y’all know Markiplier beat the Bikrin boss with just pistols and knives?
[1:33:27] <SMuffinMan> Billy you shouldn't bite your cat
[1:33:28] <%PerrinIsDead> I do if he bite first
[1:33:29] <%SoFarFetched> @Rolandknight cause he messed up the train sequence of stoping it.
[1:33:30] <majindusto> WTF PAT!!!!!
[1:33:30] <%ha2ken> Like that thing people do to babies?
[1:33:31] <+JohnyG> Pat are you gonna play the Fire Emblem Sewer Kids DLC when it comes out next month

[1:33:40] <%tiaramaki> @Rolandknight Made an oops on the timed portion and looped around

[1:33:48] <SMuffinMan> BILL LEE
[1:33:49] <%spongeofmystery> @Rolandknight he got lost and went the wrong way during the countdown timer after talking mad shit about how long you get to do it
[1:33:50] <%lionandfox21> In medieval Spain, theres a recipe on how to cook a cat

[1:34:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Was that all just a ploy to get back your lost ammo pat?
[1:34:19] <%spongeofmystery> Remember it's a straight line
[1:34:20] <AdmiralButtloaf> you can do it billy

[1:45:30] <%TheSphereHunter> save leechman for later
[1:45:31] <%cdrom321> I never kill the leech man.
[1:45:32] <%Jolnir> Nice fallout music crapcom
[1:45:32] <s1rcuit> We're dangerously close to reaching Steve levels of stupid.
[1:45:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Maybe

[1:45:37] <RinkuTheFirst> don't kill leech man
[1:45:41] <%SoFarFetched> Leechman Later pat.
[1:45:44] <RinkuTheFirst> It's a waste of ammo
[1:45:45] <%TheSphereHunter> go right through these doors becuase that leads you to the shotgun
[1:45:47] <%GabeSweetMan> Thank for helping our babyman Sue.
[1:45:49] <%spongeofmystery> Once held a horror hide and seek in an old newspaper factory with this track on at all times to spook people
[1:45:50] <%mister___doctor> Bir-kun
[1:45:51] <+Karebuncle> i gotta say, i dont know if wesker and burkin 's waltdorf and statler bit is the best part or teh worst part of this game
[1:45:57] <%vaporousTippler> I'm shocked Pat doesn't like this game more. It's a littering simulator.
[1:45:57] <%cdrom321> At least wait on leech man until later.
[1:45:58] <Virgil_Valentine> Rebecca: “I am sworn to carry your burdens.”
[1:46:07] <%Pookiedaexzile> Look at Pat asking permission, RE submissive
[1:46:07] <RinkuTheFirst> @karebuncle it's amazing

[1:47:05] <+dayz1003> :'(
[1:47:07] <%tank7013> Something I never understood about STARS was that they're supposed to be a super cool special forces unit right? So why are the vast majority of them total chumps?
[1:47:08] <%spongeofmystery> Save molotovs for leech men, shoot once to shed the skin then use fire
[1:47:08] <majindusto> NAH!

[1:47:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> I got boomstick
[1:47:35] <Neo_Kaiser> Worse than RE5?
[1:47:37] <%StaceMcGate> Elmo is full loaf mode
[1:47:39] <%Baxterj7> BILLYCIDE IM DYING
[1:47:39] <+OwlLightningMage> Becca is basically a Dorra accessory
[1:47:44] <Huntercd> Elmo loaf
[1:47:44] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wrong way to shotgun, I belive
[1:47:48] <ohgodscorpions> why has no one modded the item box into this game
[1:47:56] <%natebud> Rebillabec, the ultimate power couple
[1:48:03] <%Jolnir> The 70s were cool you dont know. Loser.
[1:48:03] <fairore> Elmo big chilling
[1:48:14] <%tank7013> @Cynical2DD 1, 2, 3, Remake, and CVX
[1:48:15] <%Punchasaur> D-d-d-d-Dora, d-d-d-d-deported
[1:48:17] <Virgil_Valentine> “Why is the item box talking?”
[1:48:17] <+Karebuncle> shes trying so hard
[1:48:20] <%TheSphereHunter> there's developer painting on the wall
[1:48:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> Who are thee knock offs
[1:48:27] <%TheSphereHunter> near the typewriter
[1:48:29] <%Zerodyne90> thanks for petting elmo
[1:48:30] <curse85> i actually liked RE5
[1:48:33] <Mnightshyamallama> I thought someone did, I am probably very very wrong, but I thought that someone did make an item box mod
[1:48:36] <SleepyMaribo> can you keep her in caution the whole game?
[1:48:44] <srkAres> holy shit elmos is such a fat floof
[1:48:44] <+Javaa01> Oh yeah, for something that big, you'd most likely either need the source code, or try to reverse engineer the game
[1:48:47] <%Baxterj7> That does sound hard
[1:48:48] <%SoFarFetched> @TheSphereHunter That's a cool thing I didnt know about!
[1:48:49] <%vectorless_peon> Someone needs to draw billy with Rebecca strapped to his back grinding herbs or something
[1:48:54] <CloniiCory> RE5 is perfectly fine. Not great, not terrible. It's fun.
[1:48:57] <Cynical2DD> @tank7013 and what games are next?
[1:49:01] <%StaceMcGate> words are hard
[1:49:02] <Fujiwara_92> DOU

[1:49:30] <%tank7013> This one, 4, 5, 6, Revelations, Rev 2, and Re2make. I think that's everything
[1:49:30] <fairore> @natebud devils
[1:49:32] <%TheSphereHunter> through the double doors down stairs!
[1:49:32] <%filialpails> damn resident evil games! they ruined resident evil!
[1:49:33] <+OwlLightningMage> oh no. Paige isn't here to make Pat read like a normal human
[1:49:38] <rytisone> boomer brain hates everything
[1:49:39] <%lionandfox21> Double doors first floor
[1:49:46] <%Mindtrick_Matt> Its a terrible beautiful game.
[1:49:47] <%StaceMcGate> I need Pat to play RE6 to truly determine what is the worst RE game
[1:49:48] <+cptcmndrboss> Hey I was reading that, Pat
[1:49:49] <artoflec> My friend just got into resident evil, he's insisting on playign all of them on teh highest difficulty. He's on the final boss of this one LUL
[1:49:49] <+Dhaman> What about RE7
[1:49:56] <%Baxterj7> Umbrella High Society
[1:49:57] <+conradical> elmo is so cute wtf
[1:49:57] <%furiousfurioso> One (1) Items
[1:49:58] <+RayDaug> There's never been a good video game
[1:50:01] <+RayDaug> not one
[1:50:02] <SleepyMaribo> Does Rebecca survive past the raccoon city incident? Like is she heard from again after RE1?
[1:50:05] <BurdRightsActivist> Imagine having a box 4Head
[1:50:06] <%Baxterj7> apatWink apatWink apatWink

[1:50:09] <MachineHead9> LUL
[1:50:10] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> All vydia are bad
[1:50:11] <%vaporousTippler> All items were originally one, before the Great Sundering.
[1:50:12] <Cynical2DD> Wow 6? I thought he was never touching that shit again
[1:50:18] <%cdrom321> Emo's in blob mode.
[1:50:18] <%heroicspiritavenger> @SleepyMaribo in the CGI movies
[1:50:19] <Fujiwara_92> Item(s) One (1)
[1:50:25] <%GabeSweetMan> The front stairway is your item box! It is merely XXL.
[1:50:30] <CloniiCory> In fairness to RE6, it has Capcoms patented booty tech on point. Capcom loves hometown and it shows.
[1:50:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo is so perfect
[1:50:37] <Virgil_Valentine> @sleepymaribo She shows up in the movies
[1:50:37] <%mh9s> elmo looks very entertained by the game
[1:50:37] <%Baxterj7> Elmo is like “yes die trash” lol
[1:50:39] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why hasn't there been a box mag upgrade for the shotgun in RE
[1:50:39] <dukenux> itsa MONSTAAR
[1:50:39] <rytisone> just stand there Rebecca
[1:50:39] <%StaceMcGate> Becky is about to die

[1:50:42] <%Faustgesicht> Good work billi
[1:50:44] <%Sausious> @SleepyMaribo she's part of the bsaa but isn't used in other games
[1:50:46] <+Pendragwn> @SleepyMaribo she does a thing in a thing
[1:50:46] <%Aydarkzero> @SleepyMaribo she's in one of the cg movies where she becomes a researcher
[1:50:46] <%Pookiedaexzile> seems like the most useful
[1:50:47] <fairore> Elmo has not move from that spot for like 5min
[1:50:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo wants the Billy
[1:50:48] <%lionandfox21> @SleepyMaribo She does, but she's not mentioned as being "missing" originally though its been retconned
[1:50:48] <%tank7013> @Cynical2DD Yep, 6. All 4 campaigns too
[1:50:49] <%natebud> Billy so strong and cool
[1:50:49] <%TheSphereHunter> go Billy aalone!
[1:50:57] <CrabSlacks> at least give her some boxing gloves
[1:51:00] <Cynical2DD> Damn

[1:51:01] <+machshop> how long have these candles been lit lol
[1:51:02] <%happyface699> I’m scared
[1:51:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> for later
[1:51:11] <RunningNGunning> Does RE0 have crimson heads?
[1:51:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[1:51:15] <%dheng1> Nope
[1:51:16] <%vvitchguy> O_O
[1:51:17] <%StaceMcGate> no
[1:51:21] <+cptcmndrboss> fwiw RE6 is still a fun, if ridiculous action romp imo
[1:51:23] <Jolly_Adventurer> Bro, I think your cat's melting
[1:51:24] <+VoytekBus> at least its semi pretty looking
[1:51:29] <%TheSphereHunter> they respawn tho....
[1:51:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cat puddle
[1:51:33] <%natebud> They turn into eliminators if you leave them long enough
[1:51:34] <+OwlLightningMage> @machshop The candles are zombies too
[1:51:36] <%AncelDeLambert> these zambambos are PERFECTLY safe!
[1:51:37] <rytisone> eliminators are a real horror
[1:51:38] <%Pookiedaexzile> ESCORT MISSON
[1:51:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> wait
[1:51:45] <+machshop> @OwlLightningMage fuck
[1:51:46] <majindusto> Remember when Resident Evil 0 was supposed to be an N64 game?
[1:51:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this is the room with the shotgun
[1:51:52] <%StaceMcGate> Why are you even bringing Becky along?
[1:51:55] <SleepyMaribo> oh fuck off with eliminators, who the fuck thought that was a good enemy design
[1:51:55] <%InvisibleMan101> apatElmo
[1:51:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I've never seen a storage device limp before.
[1:52:00] <%xeros720> elmo is a soggy loaf
[1:52:00] <Gallhint> re6 is cool because I can finally say sherry is hot and not be put on a watchlist
[1:52:03] <%Verd_254> Would RE0 be next in line for a remake you think? Assuming they do another.
[1:52:04] <BlackOrchidKI> @majindusto No? What?
[1:52:10] <%SoFarFetched> @StaceMcGate Baggage Carrier for items LUL
[1:52:11] <%Aydarkzero> why's that zombie wearing body armor?
[1:52:15] <%natebud> Burn all the elimantors so they don't become crimsalimintors
[1:52:15] <%Aydarkzero> CRIT
[1:52:19] <%dheng1> Hold me billy
[1:52:20] <L_A_S_E_R_M_A_N> @gallhint Youre probably on a watchlist
[1:52:21] <%lionandfox21> @Verd_254 that or CVX
[1:52:23] <%TheSphereHunter> shotgun around corner
[1:52:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> i work out

[1:52:31] <trulythedude> let me lick your calves billy
[1:52:31] <%StaceMcGate> Billy was so hot that this was the only game he ever appeared in
[1:52:33] <Gallhint> nooooooooo
[1:52:35] <%SoFarFetched> @StaceMcGate Also she's the only one who can mix herbs because billy cant.
[1:52:38] <%Teintstein> what's up nerds - how much hawt billy did I miss out on?
[1:52:43] <%Aydarkzero> I GOT A SHOTGUN
[1:52:43] <SleepyMaribo> the only thing good about this game is running thru it after you unlock infinite ammo
[1:52:45] <%Shadicara> Billy is like becca hold my items
[1:52:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Billy is hot like day old soup that you microwave for too long
[1:52:49] <%TheSphereHunter> some RE1 music up in here
[1:53:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Teintstein A TON of Billy
[1:53:01] <mankeytennis> Pat you could ride Elmo into town.
[1:53:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> backbecca
[1:53:05] <+RatedRGibby> Where would you put RE0 on your RE list?
[1:53:08] <%Theastrica> ugh my internet is crapping out. ill have to catch the vod later. night all!

[1:53:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo is so invested in the rich storyline of Billy Evil 0
[1:53:50] <%Teintstein> @King_Wolf_Rigger DAM - I'll have to watch the vod later to get the rest of the billy
[1:53:51] <narusao> dat elmo tho
[1:53:52] <%natebud> This is the only classic RE game where zombies don't reset as soon as you leave a room. You can train them to one side of a room with one character and get around them with another. There's never a chance to do it though.
[1:53:53] <%Shadicara> Becca blaster
[1:53:57] <%Caped_Eggy> Rebecca save billy
[1:54:07] <%Caped_Eggy> She took the bite

[1:54:28] <+OwlLightningMage> Did Pat miss that shotgun?
[1:54:29] <%AncelDeLambert> Gee, Umbrella, what do you wanna do tonight? "The same thing we do every night, STARS, try to take over the world!!!"
[1:54:29] <%Aydarkzero> effective*
[1:54:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> PAthas one weird ass armrest

[2:07:08] <hectic_harlequin> @AngriestPat Where do you think they'll be taking the RE series after 3's remake? You think something more like 7, or something like the REmakes?
[2:07:09] <Arek_1> Bless you.

[2:07:35] <%Punchasaur> Bemly
[2:07:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I'm so lucky I'm immune to toxoplasmosis.
[2:07:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> What game is he doing after 0?

[2:08:12] <%natebud> billy too big for lift
[2:08:13] <%tank7013> @TheHeroAppears That could actually be amazing
[2:08:21] <rytisone> now die
[2:08:26] <Punisher7771> this game has so many becky rays in the setting
[2:08:29] <Ipsenscastle> nothing special
[2:08:34] <+VoytekBus> ewww
[2:08:35] <arkv01> billy casted marin karin!
[2:08:36] <jestrfestr> why is it in 4;3 this game is on steam?
[2:08:37] <%grandark_z317> apatWrong
[2:08:40] <+OwlLightningMage> RE8 needs to be Joe Baker wrestling zombies
[2:08:44] <%lionandfox21> why not clear it for later?
[2:08:48] <majindusto> BIG BUGS...OH NOOOOOOoooo
[2:09:05] <%Punchasaur> Boigz
[2:09:07] <+Astaroth130> @Rashnam YES you panda come at me stripRat stripTorch
[2:09:07] <%Dr_Mooose> rekt
[2:09:08] <%Shadicara> Joe Baker needs his own game fighting the zambos
[2:09:08] <%spongeofmystery> Missed the hat change
[2:09:12] <Huntercd> Becky needs a bigger shoe
[2:09:15] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker is the strongest RE protagonist ever.
[2:09:21] <trulythedude> UWot MorphinTime
[2:09:22] <rytisone> Birdemic warned us about this
[2:09:24] <SMuffinMan> 4:3 because it looks better
[2:09:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> They want her hat.
[2:09:28] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker for Smash Brothers
[2:09:30] <dukenux> Birdie
[2:09:31] <Captain_Joe1911> atpBird gonna steal her hat
[2:09:35] <hectic_harlequin> @TheHeroAppears And then at the finale a mysterious Umbrella soldier tosses you a Power Glove for the final boss, and afterwards he takes off his helmet and says..."I'm Baker."
[2:09:39] <ohgodscorpions> ohmahgaaaw beckay
[2:09:43] <%Punchasaur> Bimmy
[2:09:46] <mr_gunn> BOO
[2:09:47] <+StrawberryPantsu> Jack>Joe
[2:09:50] <$Rashnam> @Astaroth130 "come at me" rooGasm
[2:09:55] <%Shadicara> Joe Baker could power bomb Nemesis
[2:09:56] <%natebud> Look at this evil gym class
[2:09:56] <Lmsd944> even the cats like oh boy big spooks
[2:09:58] <SMuffinMan> Centipede time
[2:09:59] <CloniiCory> Guns are inefficient weapons for bird fighting, y'all need coat hangers and kung-fu kicks.
[2:10:03] <Ipsenscastle> Becky & Jammy
[2:10:04] <%ospreyworks> These pre-rendered backgrounds are wasted on this game
[2:10:05] <Punisher7771> Jack baker for smash
[2:10:10] <rytisone> asmr running
[2:10:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Who was the badass uncle in RE7 that punched everything?
[2:10:15] <dukenux> Joe Baker could suplex Mr. X
[2:10:21] <mr_gunn> “Welcome to the family son”
[2:10:21] <+VoytekBus> it'll be fine
[2:10:23] <%Teintstein> so uh how much of pat's monologuing has just been him saying permutations of "becky," and "billy?"
[2:10:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Was it Joe?
[2:10:24] <hectic_harlequin> @King_Wolf_Rigger Joe Baker
[2:10:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> So is Becky like a semi-pokemon now?
[2:10:28] <%Sausious> birdemic game when
[2:10:30] <%AncelDeLambert> @CloniiCory NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:10:32] <SMuffinMan> Joe Baker, Wolf
[2:10:33] <Punisher7771> i think that was jack
[2:10:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> just saying her name to herself all the fuckin time?
[2:10:35] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker OUTTA NOWHERE
[2:10:36] <CrabSlacks> Isn't this the one with evil monkeys?
[2:10:38] <%jorniev> could joe baker eat up nemesis?
[2:10:44] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @hectic_harlequin Thanks. He's so radical.
[2:10:44] <+Astaroth130> @Rashnam not today stripTaunt
[2:10:48] <%jorniev> i mena beat up
[2:10:48] <%EpsilonDSC> Has Pat died at all?
[2:10:50] <dukenux> Joe is the wrestling grandpa. Jack is his brother.
[2:10:52] <hectic_harlequin> @OwlLightningMage GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY HE KILLED HIM
[2:10:54] <%natebud> billy so sturdy like oak
[2:10:54] <%SilverFaustX> no
[2:10:58] <Kiraklene> @
[2:11:03] <Arek_1> @jestrfestr 16:9 is pan-and-scan. 4:3 is the full frame.
[2:11:03] <arkv01> I didn't say stop pat... keep that asmr coomin...
[2:11:04] <Lmsd944> Does Rebecca ever found out about Weskers creepy picture of her ?
[2:11:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> I zoned out there for a second When did we catch the Beckee TemTem?
[2:11:06] <JoelFleran> billy zoom zoom
[2:11:07] <Gallhint> is it ironic that this game starts literally as a fucking trainwreck?
[2:11:08] <hectic_harlequin> @King_Wolf_Rigger I so want Joe to return, he's the best.
[2:11:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> what a quick bleedout
[2:11:15] <%rytyoung> I couldn't tell what was happening
[2:11:20] <%xeros720> rebilly and bibecca
[2:11:22] <+VoytekBus> i spilled some cranberry juice
[2:11:24] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yo Joe Baker vs Mr X though.....
[2:11:25] <CloniiCory> @AncelDeLambert Remember when Rod started doing random kung-fu moves in Birdemic 2? That was when Birdemic when from classy to high brow Kino tbh.
[2:11:27] <+OwlLightningMage> I love that no one is talking about this game. LUL
[2:11:31] <%Aydarkzero> feels like it yeah
[2:11:32] <dukenux> But your brain turns out?
[2:11:33] <%lucidrush> Are you going to do all the RE dlc @AngriestPat
[2:11:34] <%natebud> CVX is at least interesting in how terrible it is
[2:11:35] <bugsmr> why doesnt joe, the largest , simply eat the other bakers
[2:11:36] <arkv01> man cvx sounds like a capcom vs game
[2:11:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @hectic_harlequin RE8 is all him and Chris just bro-punching zombos
[2:11:38] <%Punchasaur> Cranberry jews
[2:11:39] <%Teintstein> damned by faint praise
[2:11:42] <%grandark_z317> @gallhint no, it's poetic.
[2:11:43] <%tank7013> I want to see the conversation between Wesker and Birkin that's like "Did they change clothes? When the hell did they change clothes?"
[2:11:45] <%Sausious> a solid fine is worse than a really bad
[2:11:46] <%Conyst> Joe Baker was the best part of RE7
[2:11:47] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> Nemesis is second best TLR
[2:11:48] <hectic_harlequin> All I remember about it is "Hey Queenie! Feast on THIS!" and that's about it.
[2:11:48] <zayasu> woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:11:49] <ohgodscorpions> its the most bland resi game
[2:11:51] <%ospreyworks> Well, yeah. It's a prequel in which Rebecca learns nothing because she needs to be surprised by Wesker's betrayal
[2:11:52] <hectic_harlequin> Kinda forgettable.
[2:11:57] <dukenux> RE0 is a game
[2:12:00] <%ospreyworks> It's a useless prequel made for the sake of having one
[2:12:01] <%natebud> Revelations is better than RE0, think about that
[2:12:02] <hectic_harlequin> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'd adore that.
[2:12:03] <Lmsd944> When i clicked on the stream i was like oh boy time for floor item management
[2:12:05] <%SilverFaustX> capcom can make the best and worst games at the same time
[2:12:12] <%JJCheeker> I remember why I only rented this game once
[2:12:13] <%Shadicara> Joe made Ethan look like an absolute pussy
[2:12:40] <%xeros720> they made assets for REmake, might as well make some more
[2:12:40] <SMuffinMan> Joe Baker was real shit
[2:12:43] <%Scevda> Are they both present today? I need some bants to listen to
[2:12:43] <%Punchasaur> It’s called 0 because that’s how many people remember it
[2:12:47] <%ospreyworks> Nothing of real consequence can be allowed to happen and everything has to wrap up by the end
[2:12:50] <%natebud> Appease the paiting with your offerings
[2:12:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Capcom loves to be inconsistent with their output. I hope Dragon's Dogma 2 is good LUL
[2:13:00] <%grandark_z317> apatHoldon
[2:13:02] <Gallhint> I only ever read the prima strategy guide for this game because poor youth
[2:13:11] <guardian_collin> the best Resident Evil game
[2:13:14] <%Conyst> Joe would take care of the zombies Chris would take care of the boulders
[2:13:14] <hectic_harlequin> The best boi
[2:13:15] <trulythedude> no
[2:13:17] <mankeytennis> We'd never guess
[2:13:18] <Lmsd944> no mods for this game then?
[2:13:19] <%Teintstein> oh man I forgot that this game used the Texas Roadhouse™ inventory system
[2:13:23] <JoelFleran> that backing sound in the inventory sounds like Maggie from the simsions
[2:13:26] <%sporeian94> Pat today I saw two seagulls eating the corpse of a dead seagull in the parking lot of my work!
[2:13:37] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Teintstein lol so true
[2:13:44] <%natebud> nah
[2:13:49] <%tank7013> @OwlLightningMage As long as they let Itsuno be and give him cash it should be great
[2:13:49] <%grandark_z317> @sporeian94 the weak feed the strong.
[2:13:51] <+Estuko> LUL
[2:13:51] <%JJCheeker> where do you live
[2:13:53] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:13:56] <CloniiCory> @Gallhint I can one up that, I only had the EGM articles because my mom refused to buy me any M-Rated games.
[2:13:56] <Arek_1> @sporeian94 Damn.
[2:14:00] <rytisone> it did
[2:14:02] <SMuffinMan> Lol
[2:14:03] <Ipsenscastle> lookit that cute Elmo puddle
[2:14:04] <+dmtjinni> Pat youre my friend
[2:14:08] <%natebud> Rebecca fears nothing
[2:14:11] <dukenux> Joe's solo game would have to be an ippo like first person brawler
[2:14:14] <tolloponik> @sporeian94 man Natures awesome Ain't it
[2:14:15] <+OwlLightningMage> @tank7013 I hope they do
[2:14:16] <%Aydarkzero> hey look a grenade launcher
[2:14:18] <+VoytekBus> she does have some good comedic timing
[2:14:18] <hectic_harlequin> @Conyst Honestly between Joe, Wesker, Chris and Jack, RE's on it's way to becoming the Shonen series it was always meant to be.
[2:14:23] <%cdrom321> Oh, look. Giant versions of regular animals.
[2:14:26] <SMuffinMan> Bill Lee
[2:14:27] <%Punchasaur> Crinkets
[2:14:27] <%Shadicara> Grenade launcher what PogChamp
[2:14:34] <SMuffinMan> ROGER
[2:14:35] <Gallhint> @cloniicory damn bro
[2:14:40] <%natebud> Rebecca best goldfish
[2:14:43] <+OwlLightningMage> ROGG ERT
[2:14:45] <CrabSlacks> Becky is good at following
[2:14:45] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> COME ON
[2:14:53] <JoelFleran> Gaidluncher
[2:14:54] <bugsmr> is re6 the boruto of resident evil
[2:14:55] <Lmsd944> some guys like oh damn i left my grenade launcher on the couch
[2:14:57] <%cdrom321> Billy is not my lover.
[2:14:57] <TriadOrion> Ah yes, the Grenade Launcher. With the Acid Rounds, it's the Eliminator Eliminator
[2:14:59] <%Conyst> @hectic_harlequin I would be fine with that
[2:15:20] <%peachy996> Blecky?
[2:15:29] <%Aydarkzero> what
[2:15:30] <%peachy996> Did you just say Blecky?
[2:15:32] <dukenux> how sexist
[2:15:33] <+OwlLightningMage> A Rocker Lawnchair needs to be a Enter the Gungeon weapon
[2:15:34] <+BishopBain> Ah Zero, everyone's favorite Resident Evil. Kappa
[2:15:38] <%Punchasaur> Bleppy and Borky
[2:15:38] <CloniiCory> @Gallhint My little brother has the benefits of my mom being more chill. No way would I have gotten to play Red Dead 2 at his age lol
[2:15:39] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> I get you
[2:15:40] <Rostichenburg> Not in RE6
[2:15:40] <rytisone> for girls
[2:15:41] <%ospreyworks> Do you think Wesker asked Jake's mom to wear the basketball uniform?
[2:15:42] <Ipsenscastle> Kalina Ann
[2:15:44] <trulythedude> give Ashley the rpg
[2:15:45] <Huntercd> Redfield's Bizarre Adventure
[2:15:47] <Explodincatz> explain
[2:15:53] <%Aydarkzero> Ada got a shotgun though
[2:15:53] <+OwlLightningMage> Girls loves Rocker Lawnchairs
[2:15:55] <hectic_harlequin> @Conyst Which is hilarious when ya think about it, considering Devil May Cry became it's own thing because it was considered too "out there" for RE and now we have crazy swamp Cajuns with Power Gloves
[2:15:55] <%bread_assassin> TBF, it really is a feminine weapon.
[2:15:58] <Rostichenburg> Chris and Piers gets it in 6
[2:16:00] <%tank7013> @OwlLightningMage After they did the same thing for DMC5 and it payed off super well, they'd be idiots not too. And ever since Inafune left they've not been TOTAL idiots
[2:16:03] <%ha2ken> A toy grenade launcher....for girls...
[2:16:07] <bugsmr> feminism is about giving every woman one grenade launcher
[2:16:11] <%PauliusMaximus> capcom has s fetish for women weilding explosives
[2:16:12] <sakeydo> or the bishi-est of men.
[2:16:18] <%Shikari21> Bitches love cannons
[2:16:19] <Gallhint> re8: for girls
[2:16:21] <%natebud> Leon gets the mine thrower which is way better though...
[2:16:24] <%cdrom321> Even in RE4, Leon gets the rocket launcher, but only after Ada had it first.
[2:16:25] <Lmsd944> maybe it just looks cool
[2:16:34] <CloniiCory> Capcom loves women with big explosions and big butts.
[2:16:35] <%jorniev> can you imagine it, DMC weapons in RE
[2:16:38] <lessthanhuman_tv> For Girls!
[2:16:39] <%natebud> Burn roaches so they don't become Crimsaliminators
[2:16:42] <%peachy996> Leon gets the Red 9
[2:16:44] <Huntercd> Jill Claire Haru yea Japan has a thing for women and grenade launchers
[2:16:47] <dukenux> @cdrom321 oh my god thats true
[2:16:47] <%Punchasaur> Get it because those weapons look like big peenor
[2:16:53] <%happyface699> Grenade for girls
[2:17:01] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta combine shit with those statues, for later
[2:17:15] <+OwlLightningMage> @tank7013 This is true.
[2:17:16] <dukenux> quick i need to know if Sheva uses a rocket/grenafe launcher before Chris
[2:17:18] <hectic_harlequin> @Huntercd @Punchasaur JUGLAND
[2:17:28] <sakeydo> dont burn roaches that how you get high
[2:17:36] <%natebud> billy cautiously optimistic
[2:17:38] <%Monkeyweed21> How big is Rebecca making your penis?
[2:17:42] <%Punchasaur> Rocket launcher even has a red tipped rocket
[2:17:45] <Huntercd> Roaches scream when burned
[2:17:48] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wow
[2:17:49] <Rostichenburg> Too many saves
[2:17:49] <hectic_harlequin> O C D
[2:17:49] <%Aydarkzero> oh...
[2:17:54] <dukenux> monkaS
[2:17:56] <SMuffinMan> F
[2:17:56] <%sporeian94> For the life of me why would the devs think it's a good idea to remove storage boxes it's soooooo awkward
[2:17:57] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat at risk!
[2:17:58] <$Stratiotai2> GREMLINS
[2:18:02] <Ultimatefool> Just mod the game to have 1000 save slots
[2:18:02] <%Verd_254> my life for a timestamp
[2:18:05] <faldin> the g in girl stand for grenade
[2:18:06] <%Aydarkzero> remember chat rotating saves is for cowards
[2:18:08] <Essixian> @sakeydo Are you saying we should put roaches into pipes and smoke them because that sounds like a great time
[2:18:12] <dukenux> Pat plays every RE game exactly tge same ecery time
[2:18:13] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Huntercd I dunno if you knew this man, but everything screams when it's burned.
[2:18:20] <%Scevda> Mind goblin activated.
[2:18:22] <%natebud> billy dress well for big day
[2:18:31] <Essixian> @King_Wolf_Rigger Only if you're a bitch
[2:18:36] <faldin> the I for incendiary grenades
[2:18:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> true
[2:18:42] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> @angriestpat you should have just done Wesker mode
[2:18:42] <%Shadicara> You could just have one save pat Kappa
[2:18:44] <dukenux> even CVX?
[2:18:46] <SMuffinMan> CVX tho
[2:18:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Essixian Y'know what? Fair 'nuff.
[2:18:53] <%cdrom321> @Punchasaur The rocket launcher at the end of RE4? I'm convinced that Ada colored the tip with her lipstick before giving it to Leon.
[2:18:59] <%spongeofmystery> It's odd that the grenade launcher Claire gets in RE2 is meant to be the same one from Terminator 2
[2:19:01] <%Aydarkzero> the planning in this felt excessive honestly
[2:19:07] <bugsmr> g.i.r.l.=grenades, incendiary, rocket launcher
[2:19:08] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[2:19:08] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 19m.

[2:19:10] <%natebud> Billy not give up
[2:19:11] <+VoytekBus> that looks kinky
[2:19:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I wonder what will happen...
[2:19:17] <Plague_bagel> oh boy
[2:19:22] <Essixian> @cdrom321 "This is the closest my lipstick will ever get to Leon's dick"
[2:19:23] <%Monkeyweed21> DROP IT ON BECKY
[2:19:23] <%Punchasaur> Remember when the LA Noire guys were making a game called fucking WHORE OF THE ORIENT
[2:19:26] <Ultimatefool> Gotta hand it to this game though, as crap as it is, it looks amazing
[2:19:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @cdrom321 What if she gave it a kiss, like blowing a kiss to her boy toy?

[2:26:18] <%spongeofmystery> RE 0 doesn't have a Steve though
[2:26:26] <%StaceMcGate> ResidentSleeper
[2:26:28] <metallibilly> he's eating your backpack
[2:26:29] <OkamiDude15> AH BILLY nkoD
[2:26:31] <Finakala> CVX is a'ight
[2:26:34] <Decoyhound> so anyway centipede monster masume when
[2:26:35] <Rostichenburg> Are you getting anyone to coop RE 5 and 6?
[2:26:37] <%Aydarkzero> yay
[2:26:39] <$shurtal> FIRST TRY
[2:26:39] <cascadepersona> At least CVX is entertaining in how awful it is.
[2:26:39] <+Navekraith> That bug wasn't a monster he just wanted a friend................
[2:26:42] <rytisone> first try
[2:26:42] <Essixian> SHOOT THROUGH REBECCA, HER BLOOD WILL ADD BONUS DAMAGE TO THE BULLETS AS THEY PASS THROUGH HER BODY
[2:26:43] <%Sir_stride> steve actively pisses me off. this game is just boring
[2:26:44] <%Teintstein> it's really great how this boss barely attempts to hurt anyone and just kinda walks around the room
[2:26:45] <%natebud> yeah that's cool
[2:26:51] <%happyface699> NOOo but billy must eat his Becky breadstick girl
[2:26:52] <%SoFarFetched> @Rostichenburg he gonna solo play it with AI cause he prefers that.
[2:26:52] <Zaphire_Saucypants> came out with even LESS ammo
[2:26:52] <+OwlLightningMage> This one is more boring because it's less offensively terrible
[2:26:53] <Plague_bagel> how about one more time
[2:26:55] <%peachy996> RE0 is the pretty sister and CVX is the ugly sister but deep down they're both terrible people
[2:26:57] <Virgil_Valentine> 2-1
[2:26:59] <Arkhamman367> Why is there a centipede in this zombie game?
[2:26:59] <+Ilpala> "I did it perfect, billy" *Shoots Rebecca in the fucking face mashing through the cutscene*
[2:27:01] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Decoyhound Not fast enough
[2:27:01] <%Baxterj7> Cheer500 You can do it Billy
[2:27:02] <+Scevda> PERFECT
[2:27:11] <%natebud> billy defy expectations
[2:27:12] <$shurtal> Pat Like Hat
[2:27:12] <%Monkeyweed21> Billy Baggins
[2:27:12] <Kiraklene> will you co-op RE 5 and 6?
[2:27:13] <%arcaderabbit48> What an amazing boss fight, removing a player character and therefore removing the entire gimmick of the game. Wow. Amazing
[2:27:14] <CrabSlacks> RIP long lobster
[2:27:16] <%Aydarkzero> @peachy996 i'll accept that

[2:27:41] <+Ilpala> billy-ttebayo
[2:27:41] <%cdrom321> Yeah. You don't want to burn out before things get good with RE4.
[2:27:41] <%StaceMcGate> FF7 IS DEAD
[2:27:42] <%damienlunas> gotta play a good game like Umbrella Chronicles
[2:27:42] <%sporeian94> Play FF13
[2:27:42] <%Aydarkzero> Playthroughs done chat
[2:27:45] <+OwlLightningMage> Play Stranger Journey
[2:27:45] <%Darren716> Are you fucking serious
[2:27:47] <%arcaderabbit48> Biri, biri
[2:27:47] <TriadOrion> Wait

[2:27:48] <%tiaramaki> I'm sorry????
[2:27:50] <TriadOrion> Are you serious???
[2:27:52] <%RushUnplugged> this game is stale vanilla pudding, CVX is foul smelling garbage, it just leaves a worse taste
[2:27:52] <Essixian> Play Dungeons of Dredmor
[2:27:53] <%cdrom321> I remember the room item max.
[2:27:54] <+VoytekBus> mario kart 8 it is
[2:27:55] <%tank7013> Wait something just hit me. Isn't part of the reason Shinji Mikami hated Rebecca because she was a damsel in distress type? So he went and made a game where she keeps having to be saved?
[2:27:56] <JoelFleran> Billy is so FED!
[2:28:00] <%Punchasaur> Bishi bishiiiiii
[2:28:00] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> fantastic

[2:28:07] <metallibilly> the extra backpack has a limit too lol
[2:28:10] <%Baxterj7> Billy is FED
[2:28:13] <MayorRev> wait you're not streaming FF7 remake? I missed it
[2:28:15] <+Ell1ot> There is clearly no more room on the floor
[2:28:16] <%Darren716> AngriestPat Are you seriously quitting ff7 half way through?
[2:28:18] <%Sir_stride> so this game actively punishes you for being good at it?
[2:28:19] <%Aydarkzero> thanks GC Kappa
[2:28:22] <MayorRev> ohhh
[2:28:25] <%JJCheeker> What is terroribly implemented system
[2:28:29] <chronoxgp> yeah you spend like an hour going back and forth after disc changes
[2:28:34] <%unpluggedfeedback> unpluggedfeedback subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! ello rip billy for never being in another game
[2:28:34] <%StaceMcGate> @MayorRev original, he just cleared Disc 1
[2:28:36] <%SpcOpsBear> more like the N64 didn't have enough memory to hold all these items
[2:28:39] <%JJCheeker> This is why I stopped playing the game
[2:28:41] <sakeydo> coach paige through one, that should be entertaining.
[2:28:42] <%Garthunox> @darren716 he only finished disc 1, that's not halfway
[2:28:42] <+TheSurfinSlayer> The "Take a shot every time Pat says Billy" drinking game is a killer.
[2:28:46] <%happyface699> Ff7 confirmed dead
[2:28:46] <%Sir_stride> but re3 tho
[2:28:47] <%sporeian94> MMW; Remake is getting delayed again
[2:28:47] <Essixian> @Sir_stride Why the hell are you good at games you asshole, stop
[2:28:48] <%natebud> You are going to need a clean pallete before Revelations
[2:28:50] <%xxinevitablexii> ff7 bad
[2:28:55] <MayorRev> Pat don't do a Game Grumps Kappa
[2:28:55] <%Idziman> Pat i cant believe you hate ff7

[2:28:59] <+nekodelic> square delayed the remake so Pat could finish the game in time
[2:28:59] <Explodincatz> wont u burn out for the remake then?
[2:29:00] <Ipsenscastle> Pat hates 7 now, he's doing a 13 marathon instead
[2:29:00] <%SilverFaustX> a ff7 rando mod was just released
[2:29:02] <$floralkami> @tank7013 story was some higher ups wanted a more damsel type to appeal more to otakus

[2:29:10] <%Sir_stride> @essixian sorry. I drink gamer fuel
[2:29:13] <%cdrom321> @chronoxgp Yikes. What this a 2-disc on GC?
[2:29:25] <EuropanLamprey> 24 hour ff7 stream the day before release

[2:29:27] <Arkhamman367> the baby
[2:29:28] <Zaphire_Saucypants> kitchen
[2:29:39] <chronoxgp> and the first half of "mansion
[2:29:49] <%Sir_stride> funny enough, I've been playing 15 recently. its actually pretty good.
[2:29:51] <%JJCheeker> Baby is sleeping
[2:29:53] <%natebud> billy savy financier
[2:29:54] <%tank7013> @floralkami Man that's so believable and I hate that it's probably true
[2:29:58] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo is bored of this game
[2:30:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the other is upstairs, in that hallway that also leads to the crank elevator
[2:30:13] <$floralkami> @tank7013 *shrug* :)
[2:30:13] <%happyface699> Elmo got bored
[2:30:24] <CloniiCory> @Sir_stride FFXV is great. It's biggest problem is the final like 3rd of the game is rushed.
[2:30:37] <%Aydarkzero> need it though
[2:30:37] <%spongeofmystery> les bouteiles aussi
[2:30:38] <%cdrom321> Does RE0 have spiders? I feel like it does.
[2:30:39] <rytisone> wait, a week before ff7 remake is RE3 Remake
[2:30:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wasn't that a thing you had to do in a previous RE game, tho?
[2:30:42] <Ipsenscastle> Elmo has completely melted, he is completely featureless now, just a cow-coloured liquid
[2:30:46] <chronoxgp> i bought x-2, figured there was no way it'd be worse than x
[2:30:48] <%Sir_stride> @cloniicory ah. yeah I'm not even there. I just got to the boat lmao
[2:30:48] <Arkhamman367> @JJCheeker to befair this game has a really relaxing sound track
[2:30:58] <%natebud> yeah i'm fading, this is SLooooooooooow
[2:31:04] <karl_rex> Wait they were on a train how did they get here?
[2:31:08] <jadefox33445> Pat might hate Zero, but it's still more enjoyable to watch than CVX
[2:31:11] <%Niney_Who> Gelmo
[2:31:14] <CrabSlacks> "I'm positive we'll need this bottle in the future, better grab it and not anything else"
[2:31:16] <%cdrom321> @karl_rex Crash.
[2:31:20] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @karl_rex Train went too fast and crashed?
[2:31:21] <Essixian> I mean, cats are liquid by default because they shape themselves after the container they're in. Ever seen a cat in a fishbowl?
[2:31:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo is the cutest baby
[2:31:26] <dukenux> Elmo is an undescribable cloud of plasma

[2:31:30] <%JJCheeker> elmo is sleeping something I didnt get to do last night
[2:31:37] <%Sir_stride> real talk. steve is actually the worst video game character ever.
[2:31:41] <SMuffinMan> I fell asleep on the CVX stream soooo
[2:31:45] <Rostichenburg> You put them next to each other
[2:31:48] <%Sir_stride> glad that fucker died
[2:31:51] <%natebud> Just think about that first Tyrant fight pat, think about cool proto tyrant is.
[2:31:53] <bugsmr> elmo is a melting scoop of cookies & cream ice cream!
[2:31:59] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Who is Steve?
[2:32:03] <dukenux> i took a nap during CVX stream
[2:32:05] <%Meidolaon> Is that the N64 skin?
[2:32:05] <%SoFarFetched> Character from CVX
[2:32:07] <%Monkeyweed21> WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE QoL
[2:32:12] <%Sir_stride> @king_wolf_rigger steve burnside.
[2:32:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Steve isn't worse than the horrible Pumpkin that eats all the food and doesn't pat
[2:32:15] <%JJCheeker> @Arkhamman367 true I do like the soundtrack at least
[2:32:19] <Essixian> @King_Wolf_Rigger A useless prick that nobody liked
[2:32:20] <%kujofire990> wut i miss
[2:32:31] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> bros...
[2:32:31] <King_Wolf_Rigger> lol Thanks chat
[2:32:31] <%natebud> now think about eliminators
[2:32:32] <%sleepy_coffee> I am constructing bean soup and I hope everyone’s doing well on this friday night
[2:32:34] <dukenux> and i set my clock for this, cause i thought it will be better Kappa
[2:32:35] <%Sir_stride> at least billy has charisma
[2:32:36] <+TheSurfinSlayer> Audio desynched for anyone else?
[2:32:38] <CloniiCory> Perhaps if there was some kind of...box, you could put items into. That would really help I think.
[2:32:42] <Rostichenburg> I barely played CVX and I hated Steve from the two cutscene he was in
[2:32:43] <%happyface699> Ryan from beyond two souls is worse than steve
[2:32:48] <%Aydarkzero> @TheSurfinSlayer refresh
[2:32:57] <%kujofire990> BILLEH
[2:33:00] <Hellarussian> Steve is the best RE character and its not close
[2:33:04] <rytisone> ammo nation
[2:33:07] <%cdrom321> @CloniiCory What? That's dumb. You're dumb.
[2:33:08] <%happyface699> Steve sucks though
[2:33:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shotgun shells
[2:33:08] <%Meidolaon> Billeh
[2:33:09] <dukenux> whos worse, Steve or Roosh from Jedi Academy?
[2:33:09] <chronoxgp> CVX bored me to death with the knife shit
[2:33:15] <Decoyhound> pat missed the lunar harp
[2:33:24] <%Garthunox> @happyface699 no cos at least Ryan is handsome and speaks normally
[2:33:27] <SMuffinMan> I'LL GO
[2:33:28] <%tiaramaki> Billyea
[2:33:31] <%JJCheeker> roossh
[2:33:32] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Becky can push.
[2:33:35] <Rostichenburg> Rosh is just Star Wars Eric Sparrow
[2:33:35] <%happyface699> @garthunox True
[2:33:36] <%Garthunox> he also gets an eyepatch
[2:33:37] <%Sir_stride> some people out there believe Ashley is the worst RE character and not billy and I cant imagine being that wrong
[2:33:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Making the woman do the manual labor
[2:33:45] <%Aydarkzero> teamwork!
[2:33:45] <%Sir_stride> sorry
[2:33:51] <%Sir_stride> bot billu
[2:33:52] <%natebud> The only way to make this game more interesting is to split up and intentionally make the game harder for no reason.
[2:33:53] <%Sir_stride> fuck
[2:33:53] <%Garthunox> but beyond is trash so it's a moot point
[2:33:54] <%StaceMcGate> This would of been the worst RE stream if Pat hadn't of said "Billeh"
[2:33:54] <%tank7013> @dukenux Does Roosh try to kiss an unconscious woman?
[2:33:56] <%Sir_stride> steve
[2:34:02] <RadShiro> that Heartbeat on change is really fucking annoying
[2:34:03] <dukenux> people give Ashley way too much shit
[2:34:05] <Decoyhound> kazuma voice: i believe in true gender equality
[2:34:06] <chronoxgp> i think wesker is the worse character, he changes the genre of the game everytime he shows up
[2:34:12] <%JJCheeker> steve Is so bad he is funny
[2:34:23] <CloniiCory> Billy and Ashley get a one up on Steve by being hot tbh.
[2:34:25] <%peachy996> What an Odd Couple
[2:34:26] <%natebud> im glad steve is dead
[2:34:28] <Ipsenscastle> @chronoxgp for real
[2:34:28] <$Dakuu75> "GAY~!"
[2:34:28] <fabo_joyful> WESKER!!!
[2:34:29] <%Sir_stride> @chronoxgp yeah but wesker is at his best in 5
[2:34:35] <%SoFarFetched> MARCUS WANTS HIS OTP
[2:34:37] <%peachy996> Or their clothes
[2:34:38] <+OwlLightningMage> Wesker is hilarious because he's whatever they want him to be
[2:34:39] <seaechiowai> why are you raping my ears with your asmr, Pat
[2:34:40] <dukenux> @tank7013 thats why they eventually kick him outta the Academy
[2:34:40] <%Sausious> Ashley does a litlle "hes" gesture with her arm when you snipe enemies and just for that she's amazing
[2:34:45] <%Sir_stride> 7 minutes
[2:34:45] <%Meidolaon> I kinda wish Carlos or Parker would come back
[2:34:46] <Ipsenscastle> zombie moose head
[2:34:46] <chronoxgp> he's fucking neo in the matrix
[2:34:46] <%Sausious> yes*
[2:34:49] <%Meidolaon> Is that weird?
[2:34:52] <%Monkeyweed21> I'd be happy with Steve living if he stayed as Necrid
[2:34:56] <%Aydarkzero> tripleP
[2:34:56] <bugsmr> wait does rebecca just forget this document
[2:34:56] <%Sir_stride> 7 minutes is all the time I have to play with you
[2:34:57] <%peachy996> Annette's blonde, Albert is blond
[2:34:58] <Alexisonfires> Albert? As in Albert wesker
[2:34:58] <+monkeyU33> apatLiz
[2:34:59] <%SoFarFetched> apatBougie apatBougie Mmmm yes I do love my OTP of William and Albert.
[2:35:01] <%MajorCrasher> LUL
[2:35:04] <%peachy996> Maybe William settled
[2:35:05] <ambadev> mnyah
[2:35:05] <%natebud> Birkin and Wesker having the sexiest friday night
[2:35:06] <Decoyhound> ah the moose. the true enemy of canada
[2:35:06] <+OwlLightningMage> Wesker can be a scientist a cop or a damn Matrix character
[2:35:06] <%sporeian94> 7 minutes to get a photo of REbecca in shorts and a tank top
[2:35:07] <arkv01> uhhh with coom?
[2:35:08] <Tucker0603> COMPLETE GLOOOBAL LACTATiON
[2:35:10] <Hellarussian> Steve is a funnier character than we've ever had before
[2:35:14] <%Sir_stride> RE5 wesker IS THE BEST
[2:35:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Wesker teleports
[2:35:25] <Essixian> Seven minutes, more than enough for complete global saturation. Kappa
[2:35:27] <%cdrom321> @Sir_stride That's just because he finally actually does something other than sit around looking like the Matrix.
[2:35:32] <%sporeian94> Claire and Albert Whiskers!
[2:35:34] <%InugamiTheHound> 7 minutes to get Albert and William to make out on stream
[2:35:34] <CloniiCory> Wesker is perfection because he's a Metal Gear Boss that's somehow in a horror series.
[2:35:39] <SMuffinMan> RE5 Wesker was great
[2:35:40] <%Monkeyweed21> but why tho
[2:35:41] <trulythedude> no u
[2:35:43] <%Meidolaon> You know what I actually wish they'd have more returning characters besides Jill, Leon, and the Redfields
[2:35:46] <Rostichenburg> Wesker's holotable/space satellite room in RE4 is crazy
[2:35:50] <%Sir_stride> @cdrom321 he actually becomes the matrix
[2:35:53] <%happyface699> COMPLETE GLOBAL MENSTRUATION

[2:36:21] <+OwlLightningMage> Butt meat is tastiest to the zombie
[2:36:21] <majindusto> It said Albert...it didn't say his last name Wesker. Rebecca Wouldn't need to ever remember it
[2:36:23] <Decoyhound> @Essixian there nothing like the FEEL of a silver bullet being loaded >inhales< into a well greased chamberrr
[2:36:28] <Rostichenburg> Jill's not even a returning character anymore ever since she became blonde and white
[2:36:35] <%cdrom321> I want my big stupid baboon butts.
[2:36:35] <Tucker0603> complete global IMPREGNATION

[2:37:07] <eli_rez> I'm starting Into The Breach, name my profile
[2:37:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Depending on the creature, butt meat in general is tastey. Pork butt? Damn delicious. Man butt? Also good.
[2:37:08] <%StaceMcGate> Lets just skip this and get to Chris punching a boulder
[2:37:09] <dukenux> 7 minutes. I need only 7 minutes with Rebecca's photo i have in my desk. DxCat
[2:37:11] <Ipsenscastle> angel wangs
[2:37:12] <%natebud> billy can read
[2:37:15] <%Meidolaon> Nah fuck Sheva, though having literally anyone from Rev1 come back would be nice
[2:37:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmm delicious angel wings
[2:37:26] <Rostichenburg> I really want Ada to be arrested for her crimes against humanity
[2:37:37] <Hellarussian> that cat gets wider every stream
[2:37:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Why is Kiryu fighting zombies with Jill?
[2:37:39] <ThatOneGuyYouSaw> deep fried angel wings
[2:37:41] <%Sir_stride> re5 is great in just how fucking stupid it gets.
[2:37:44] <rytisone> thy flesh consumed
[2:37:44] <%natebud> I wish Ada turned into a big goo boat
[2:37:45] <Frozen_phoenix> leave nothing to waste
[2:37:47] <@commanderclaw> On stream?
[2:37:48] <%sporeian94> @Rostichenburg Specifically keeping Leon from conitnuing the bloodline
[2:37:51] <+Ilpala> won't he have to fight Paige for it?
[2:37:52] <Ipsenscastle> become as elmo
[2:37:53] <%peachy996> If he dies do you eat his corpse?
[2:37:55] <%EpsilonDSC> You think Elmo will outlive you and Paige?
[2:37:55] <+Estuko> That feel when your pet eats you and you get to always be apart of them FeelsGoodMan NotLikeThis ...
[2:37:55] <%happyface699> A SECRET WUH?????
[2:37:57] <seaechiowai> hmm
[2:37:59] <CloniiCory> I wish Ada would step on me tbh.
[2:38:00] <+BigBruthaThunda> someone's eating someone
[2:38:01] <+dante_must_die_exe> will emmo eat the corpse on stream?
[2:38:01] <+idyota> elmo can have little a human flesh, as a snack
[2:38:01] <trulythedude> you said you wanted to be burned in an effigy
[2:38:11] <%sleepy_coffee> ShowLove200 Hey Pat I know this ain’t the the proper time to ask but I like this lady who’s in my class but I get nervous on asking her out, any advice on the matter?
[2:38:11] <%MajorCrasher> Rev 1's story was awful. I hope all those side characters are dead
[2:38:13] <%Meidolaon> Hot take I find 5 less enjoyable to play than 6
[2:38:16] <+OwlLightningMage> Your pets will eat you if you die in front of them
[2:38:18] <mankeytennis> Could you let him eat you on stream, please?
[2:38:21] <Arek_1> Assuming Paige wouldn't eat you first. LUL
[2:38:22] <sakeydo> paige gets the skeleton
[2:38:23] <%JJCheeker> sheva in her tribal outfit Kreygasm
[2:38:25] <seaechiowai> mmmhmmmm
[2:38:29] <+Estuko> @CloniiCory I want Ada to spit in my mouth then kick me in the head with her heels. Either order is fine tbh.
[2:38:29] <Jeemukun> a "little" human you say?
[2:38:33] <Ipsenscastle> Elmo will devour you long before you finally get to die
[2:38:34] <%Meidolaon> Play being the key word, 6's maneuvering system was dope
[2:38:37] <%natebud> now we have to find an evil book
[2:38:41] <%MajorCrasher> apatCrazyhand apatCrazyhead
[2:38:42] <Hellarussian> why is there a portrait of Agent 47?
[2:38:43] <Rostichenburg> Remember when Revelaitons introduced a new character and then killed her in the opening cutscene?
[2:38:53] <chronoxgp> resident evil 6 deserved motion controls
[2:38:55] <%Meidolaon> Oh yeah, what's her face
[2:38:57] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @sleepy_coffee Take a massive snort of cocaine. I find that helps take the edge off.
[2:39:01] <rytisone> Rachel
[2:39:01] <CloniiCory> RE6 gets put on tiermaker lists for character action games, and that's horrifying.
[2:39:01] <%MelBrooksKA> @Hellarussian Why not?
[2:39:01] <Huntercd> Rachel was alright
[2:39:02] <%Meidolaon> Jessica? No, Rachel
[2:39:04] <%likuuwu> !uptime
[2:39:05] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 39m.
[2:39:10] <%natebud> Revelations introduced like 8 new characters and they all lived
[2:39:11] <%Meidolaon> Jessica was the one who slipped by
[2:39:17] <Frozen_phoenix> da boogs
[2:39:17] <dukenux> Chris will prosecute Ada in Hague for crimes and coochblocking Claire.
[2:39:19] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why does this area look so shitty?
[2:39:20] <Hellarussian> @MelBrooksKA good point
[2:39:25] <Oxybe> boogs
[2:39:33] <%Meidolaon> Literally everything from Rev1 is just a massive hanging thread
[2:39:35] <%JJCheeker> Apparently we will be eating bugs in the future
[2:39:38] <%StaceMcGate> this part of the game drags hard @AngriestPat
[2:39:38] <Decoyhound> ah yes the starship troopers
[2:39:39] <+OwlLightningMage> Whoopsy shitsils
[2:39:41] <%Meidolaon> Almost a hanging rope at this point
[2:39:41] <%Monkeyweed21> ADA WAIT
[2:39:47] <%natebud> But what about Terragrigia though!?
[2:39:50] <+OwlLightningMage> THIS GAME IS SO BORING
[2:39:57] <Ipsenscastle> like in snowpiercer
[2:40:01] <%Aydarkzero> look at all this progress Kappa
[2:40:04] <%happyface699> A hanging chain honestly
[2:40:06] <+BigBruthaThunda> Shrimp are bugs
[2:40:08] <%JJCheeker> Let's all get some grub
[2:40:08] <Arkhamman367> Future bugs is fine I guess
[2:40:11] <Azathotic> As long as I dont see its bug face I'm okay
[2:40:11] <%LunarRemix> People will riot and have civil wars over not eating bugs, you are crazy
[2:40:13] <+dustingunn> If you enable the 2D controls in this game, you can make Billy and Becca run circles around eachother
[2:40:15] <+dustingunn> it's the best part
[2:40:16] <%Monkeyweed21> at least it looks nice
[2:40:20] <CloniiCory> All I know about Rev 1 is it has Jill in a tight wetsuit the whole game and I'm fine with that.
[2:40:21] <dukenux> as long as theyre cooked
[2:40:22] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Billy isn't boring. Only boring people playing it.
[2:40:24] <supahrob64> Gotta bring up the moment. AH BILLY! BUGS
[2:40:24] <Rostichenburg> Lion King showed us how cool eating bugs is
[2:40:24] <Azathotic> I cant eat fish because it fucks me up seeing the FISH FACE in the supermarket
[2:40:25] <%natebud> fading fast, only thing keeping me awake, billy's coolness
[2:40:27] <%JJCheeker> Eat a grub like bear grills
[2:40:28] <Huntercd> Mantis shrimp arre dangerous
[2:40:32] <%peachy996> Looking nice can only take you so far
[2:40:34] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Wait, I think I butchered that line.
[2:40:35] <Alexisonfires> Can’t you control both characters at the same time by pushing both the analog stick? rooThink I could’ve swore that was a feature
[2:40:36] <tolloponik> have fun having your body turn on you

[2:41:21] <%Sausious> aren't partners in this kind of game G R E A T
[2:41:23] <Ipsenscastle> the thing about code veronica and zero is that it feels like they were treading water storywise until someone thought of an idea for where to go with it all. And then noone ever did.
[2:41:23] <Oxybe> Billy did a bigstrong
[2:41:25] <Huntercd> Rev 2 Claire's rodeo costume could barely contain her ass
[2:41:26] <+OwlLightningMage> This stream is fun though LUL

[2:42:27] <Alexisonfires> Can’t you control both characters at the same time by pushing both the analog stick? rooThink I could’ve swore that was a feature in the game?
[2:42:27] <+The_Proud_Canadian> play bug island instead of this, we'll all go along with it don't worry
[2:42:28] <%natebud> Think about the boss fountain pat
[2:42:29] <+Estuko> JEsus, for a second I forgot I had the sctream up and pat's fucking breathing was making me freak out trying to find the source. NotLikeThis doodTerror
[2:42:31] <Essixian> We're all upset will Billy
[2:42:33] <%Tman451> what controller are you using?
[2:42:34] <Oxybe> but he did BigStrong
[2:42:35] <%vaporousTippler> Having both people injured in the exact same spot looks silly.
[2:42:37] <%happyface699> DINO CRISIS REMAKE NOW!!!
[2:42:44] <Arkhamman367> Did RE 6 rip this off?
[2:42:44] <+OwlLightningMage> Billy is doing his best
[2:42:44] <%catbugusf> DINO CRISIS REMAKE NOW!!!!!!

[2:43:14] <%happyface699> DINO CRISIS REMAKE NOW!
[2:43:15] <CloniiCory> The real question is why is every architect in the RE Universe such an asshole?
[2:43:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Pat, are you really mad at Billy? Or are you actually mad at yourself?
[2:43:19] <%SoFarFetched> think he's almost halfway
[2:43:19] <%Aydarkzero> @Guardiansaiyan HA
[2:43:20] <rytisone> It's because Billy is not wearing WOLF FORCE
[2:43:25] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @Guardiansaiyan fuck no

[2:43:46] <Oxybe> WOLFFORCE would make it go faster.
[2:43:46] <Essixian> Billy cannot think properly while he's in Rebecca's presence, he's too preoccupied with thoughts of swan-diving into that cooch like an olympian
[2:43:46] <King_Wolf_Rigger> would've
[2:43:46] <%natebud> Thta's funny I feel like pat's done.

[2:54:40] <Frodiddly> ooo the armor sound effect from Baldur's Gate
[2:54:43] <%SoFarFetched> @DappercatEsquire mapping for the puzzle he did.
[2:54:43] <Decoyhound> gold chocobos ARE SICK
[2:54:43] <sakeydo> think about it, monster controlled by flute. total naruto reference. lol
[2:54:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> wonderful puzzling
[2:54:44] <%natebud> All these students accidentally opening the sword doors
[2:54:44] <%akumakins> apatDab
[2:54:47] <Hellarussian> ya
[2:54:47] <%peachy996> I'm actually really mad dumbshit Capcom's buffonery led to Remake lookin worse than this because this game does not deserve to look as good as it does
[2:54:51] <%Sir_stride> getting a normal gold chocobo in FF7 fucking sucks
[2:54:53] <+SlappyMeats> What if Ethan in RE7 is actually Billy, since both of them are invincible tank machines?
[2:55:04] <%Garthunox> @vvitchguy but then Rev2 makes no sense Kappa
[2:55:07] <%peachy996> *Remake HD rather
[2:55:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> oh god, oh geez
[2:55:19] <chronoxgp> let you put stuff on floor, gives you limited saves hmmm
[2:55:23] <dukenux> why did you need to see the same cutscene from 3 different angles
[2:55:24] <%leinadtonu> good Pat. Never trust yourself.
[2:55:25] <%natebud> Imagine if you were just using some random projector at school and some secret door opens.
[2:55:25] <Hellarussian> hmm
[2:55:26] <Decoyhound> gold chocobos seperate the men from the casuls
[2:55:27] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Your fucked.
[2:55:29] <Ipsenscastle> Getting a gold chocobo in RE is even harder
[2:55:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe break the chain?
[2:55:32] <%SoFarFetched> oh no
[2:55:32] <+SWindleFeD> Is Pat failing at save scumming?
[2:55:34] <Hellarussian> im confusion
[2:55:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> go further down from now on?
[2:55:38] <%vvitchguy> I wasnt a huge fan of Rev2. Idk :\
[2:55:41] <%happyface699> Incwedible
[2:55:51] <%DappercatEsquire> RESET TEMTEM
[2:55:51] <%SoFarFetched> @SWindleFeD no the problem is it still has the old saves from the RE0 play through two best friends did LUL
[2:55:53] <%leinadtonu> confused Pat is my favourite Pat.
[2:56:04] <%peachy996> Past Pat confuses Current Pat, Can Future Pat adjust?
[2:56:08] <%Sir_stride> @leinadtonu confused and annoyed pat
[2:56:09] <+cafefunk> cupahHi
[2:56:15] <%Garthunox> @vvitchguy what's it like having bad taste?
[2:56:31] <%natebud> CVX mansion is still worse
[2:56:32] <%vvitchguy> Salty.
[2:56:33] <%StaceMcGate> spooky flute?
[2:56:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> isn't this puzzle for later, tho?
[2:56:36] <+SWindleFeD> @SoFarFetched thought he would've deleted those but whatever I guess
[2:56:37] <bugsmr> the only thing that can defeat pat is past pat
[2:56:40] <+SpoonlessAlakazam> Puppy paw pad PogChamp
[2:56:46] <Essixian> RE:0 2.0 - You Can (NOT) Rotate Saves
[2:56:46] <%Sir_stride> just think pat. after this is RE4. an actual good game for once.
[2:56:49] <%KingSpunf> Did they *need* to have the door opening movies by the time this game came out or did they just keep it for tradition's sake?
[2:56:49] <Zaphire_Saucypants> you need a battery, if I remember right.
[2:56:51] <sakeydo> angry pat is favorite pat *rimshot*
[2:56:55] <%leinadtonu> there should be a confused Pat funko pop...
[2:56:55] <Hellarussian> drat
[2:56:58] <Decoyhound> you need to pickup the zeio nut in the bathroom for the gold chocobo later
[2:56:59] <%Garthunox> @vvitchguy me or you?
[2:57:01] <rytisone> You saw those KOTOR Remake rumors people?
[2:57:04] <Ipsenscastle> I can't believe I watched the whole 2BFP lp of this and yet all I remember is the train
[2:57:09] <%natebud> signs of DK
[2:57:17] <%StaceMcGate> KOTOR was already ruined by SWTOR
[2:57:20] <%Sir_stride> @kingspunf tradition
[2:57:22] <chronoxgp> they never finished the LP lol
[2:57:23] <Cynical2DD> Don’t believe their lies
[2:57:24] <%SoFarFetched> @SWindleFeD I mean he probably thought he would never boot it up again and felt no reason to delete,but with RE3make coming out it changed that.
[2:57:33] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Ipsenscastle same
[2:57:39] <%vvitchguy> I was describing the taste lol didnt translate.
[2:57:44] <%natebud> And SWTOR was ruined SKOTOTOR
[2:57:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> ugh
[2:57:51] <+MisterRockett> You guys LP'd this? I had to have watched that whole thing.
[2:57:52] <%peachy996> All I remember of the LP of this was you and Matt calling the ending a Tekken ending and agreeing
[2:57:53] <$radiocabel> this is the only resident evil game i havent beaten, and ive beaten dead aim and survivor
[2:57:53] <%Sir_stride> because the train is the best part. and that's it
[2:57:54] <%SoFarFetched> all I remember from the old playtrough is "what's gotten billy so ----"
[2:57:54] <Rostichenburg> I hope the new KOTOR fixes that games combat
[2:57:55] <CloniiCory> @StaceMcGate KOTOR was ruined by KOTOR 2 being rushed out. That game is fantastic but desperately needed more dev time
[2:57:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> this shit pile of bugs
[2:57:59] <%Garthunox> @chronoxgp ???
[2:58:01] <VeryTricky> i remember you dropping a shit load of items in the lobby and not understanding why
[2:58:01] <Cynical2DD> BATTERY
[2:58:01] <%leinadtonu> I don't even remember a train... damn
[2:58:02] <daisyyyy> Not really kotor remake rumors but just an hd port would make a lot of sense
[2:58:08] <+OwlLightningMage> I swear I thought the whole game took place on a train
[2:58:13] <%Sir_stride> god damnit rebecca
[2:58:14] <+Kilik_> I'd honestly forgotten you did an LP of this game
[2:58:19] <BurdRightsActivist> 2BFP? What's that? It sounds like a cool channel, maybe I should check it out! :)
[2:58:19] <trulythedude> I knew it
[2:58:19] <+VoytekBus> lol
[2:58:20] <+Kingtut9009> Why are bugs making a cobra shaking noise
[2:58:20] <+SWindleFeD> I bought this game and on multiple occasions tried to finish it, but I got bored EVERY time
[2:58:22] <Tersalus> why do RE games even have bugs and spiders in the first place??
[2:58:23] <Rostichenburg> The train is the most interesting part
[2:58:24] <mankeytennis> I've played it and I only remember the Chimps
[2:58:27] <Decoyhound> hopper was woke af in a bugs life
[2:58:27] <%peachy996> Rebecca draggin her feet
[2:58:33] <+OwlLightningMage> This game is so much more boring than I remember
[2:58:34] <Tersalus> they really dont need to add them...
[2:58:35] <chronoxgp> I thought matt and pat said fuck this game at least, thought they didn't finish it, can't remember...
[2:58:45] <Cynical2DD> Why is @angriestpat not playing RE7?
[2:58:45] <%natebud> MVP backpack
[2:58:50] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You don't love Becca enough, so she doesn't want to be near you.
[2:58:50] <%Garthunox> @chronoxgp they absolutely finished it
[2:58:55] <Cynical2DD> Let me rephrase that
[2:58:56] <Essixian> Dude, what if we got an ENTIRE Resident Evil game that's set entirely on board a huge train?
[2:58:59] <%StaceMcGate> The main villainous force in SWTOR is the exact same as Rise of the Skywalker
[2:58:59] <Rostichenburg> Should've just played this in Umbrella Chronicles
[2:59:00] <%peachy996> It's almost as if she's just goin through the motions, not really there. hating her very own game because IT SUCKS
[2:59:02] <%leinadtonu> did you?
[2:59:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yay more fetchquest
[2:59:08] <%NWR_James> Rebecca's tiny hat
[2:59:16] <$KnivesEve> its not her fault, they programed her like that
[2:59:17] <%Intersceptre> how late am I? :^)
[2:59:19] <+dustingunn> train to busan: the game?
[2:59:19] <%Teintstein> man why is this game so boring
[2:59:24] <%natebud> nah i changed my mind, rebecca is the worst
[2:59:25] <rytisone> train IS the best part
[2:59:25] <Decoyhound> thats how humans walk
[2:59:26] <Cynical2DD> Why is @angriestpat not doing RE7 on this marathon of Resident Evil
[2:59:33] <Ipsenscastle> fuckin' bug room
[2:59:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> god...fucking dammit
[2:59:36] <%lionandfox21> @Intersceptre Pretty like I think
[2:59:40] <+Jokobeast> @Essixian It's gotta be at least as good as the one we set entirely on board a boaaaaaaaaaah, shit.
[2:59:41] <%Sir_stride> ok chat. what's worse. a bad game or a boring one?
[2:59:42] <%lionandfox21> *late
[2:59:42] <+VoytekBus> bug rape, not cool
[2:59:45] <+The_Proud_Canadian> oh man I can't wait for the puzzle where you have to watch a 45 minute Umbrella propaganda seminar
[2:59:48] <%Garthunox> @cynical2dd are you insane? read the schedule
[2:59:49] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Talking about train games, what if that anime about iron blodded zombies was a game?
[2:59:49] <sakeydo> Hey, has Pat or Paige talked about that Undertale musical at Magfest? Heard Clemps describe it on, coffee with Clepms.
[2:59:50] <%SoFarFetched> @Cynical2DD he is doing RE7 what you talking about
[2:59:51] <%ShawnTK_> @Sir_stride boring
[2:59:52] <Ragnakawaii> I thought the whole game took place on a train
[2:59:52] <%peachy996> Instead of Chimeras...Giant Bugs
[2:59:59] <fabo_joyful> A 0 is better than a 5
[2:59:59] <Decoyhound> bad games can at least be fun
[3:00:01] <+SWindleFeD> @Sir_stride a boring game, because most people at least remember the bad game
[3:00:02] <%natebud> it does @Ragnakawaii
[3:00:04] <%Intersceptre> oop not late enough it'ss RE0
[3:00:04] <%NWR_James> @Sir_stride depends on how the game is bad. If its panful to play bad, if its funny boring
[3:00:09] <%vaporousTippler> This whole building is on a bigass train.
[3:00:12] <%peachy996> YES
[3:00:16] <%peachy996> QUIT AND LEAVE
[3:00:16] <Decoyhound> rip
[3:00:18] <%StaceMcGate> Let the hate flow through you
[3:00:19] <Rostichenburg> Chimera's are basically giant bugs anyway
[3:00:19] <%akumakins> This game looks great at least...
[3:00:22] <%Sir_stride> @nwr_james like with sonic 06
[3:00:23] <%KingSpunf> Does Billy and his Cool Tattoo show up outside this game at all?
[3:00:24] <majindusto> lol
[3:00:24] <%peachy996> Oh booo I misunderstood
[3:00:26] <%RubberFistFight> bougie savescumming apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie
[3:00:34] <%lionandfox21> JESUS for a 6 hr game its so damn long
[3:00:36] <+SWindleFeD> @AngriestPat But who is best girl?
[3:00:38] <mrshazboto> !time
[3:00:38] <trulythedude> we should watch the re movies too
[3:00:40] <%leinadtonu> restart from the begining
[3:00:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie apatBougie
[3:00:44] <%natebud> Billy got out
[3:00:46] <%NWR_James> All of Raccoon City is one giant train. PROVE ME WRONG
[3:00:46] <Decoyhound> happily ever after
[3:00:46] <%Garthunox> just like Sheva
[3:00:47] <Essixian> BILLY IS THE BEST WHY THE FUCK WAS HE NOT BROUGHT BVACK
[3:00:51] <metallibilly> billy want nothing to do with bad franchise
[3:00:53] <Rostichenburg> So was Jake
[3:00:55] <%salty_syd913> Rip billy
[3:00:55] <%peachy996> Hopefully he died in the Nuclear Blast
[3:00:56] <%Sir_stride> he and rebecca are the only ones to make it out of the series
[3:00:58] <%kujofire990> Billy will be in RE8 JUST WATCH
[3:01:00] <Essixian> @SWindleFeD Rebecca
[3:01:02] <%StaceMcGate> THE LEAST HYPE IT'S EVER BEEN
[3:01:05] <TeethandHunger> I say he's turned into Nemesis
[3:01:07] <%Garthunox> @rostichenburg fuck Jake hes trash
[3:01:08] <Decoyhound> billy was too pure for this world
[3:01:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Eh they can bring any of them back
[3:01:10] <%MelBrooksKA> Not really, that feels like most of the RE games, most of the characters get dumped
[3:01:11] <majindusto> Rebecca gets to come back in a CG movie
[3:01:12] <GandhiTheTerrible> I wish the producer didnt hate Rebecca
[3:01:13] <DracaenaLeaf> So is Rebecca besides the movie
[3:01:19] <Cynical2DD> I’m sorry, i didn’t know there was a schedule and someone didn’t mention what games he’s gonna play
[3:01:29] <mrshazboto> How much longer do you think you'll be going? Need something entertaining to watch while grinding out Equinox parts
[3:01:33] <%Sir_stride> eh @dracaenaleaf I consider the movies to be non canon
[3:01:37] <Cynical2DD> This is the first RE game I actually caught
[3:01:37] <CrazyMedicine> !uptime
[3:01:38] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 1m.
[3:01:43] <%leinadtonu> schedule is a dream man
[3:01:45] <%Garthunox> @cynical2dd someone did mention it, he did... wtf?
[3:01:48] <%rj1771> rj1771 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat! Might have totaled my care at 3:30 this morning due to fucking snow....but I'm still wondering what all these Ukrainian Scientists are doing in my dugout!!! barbToxic
[3:01:48] <%StaceMcGate> I really hope they fix Chris Redfield in RE8, he looked atrocious in RE7
[3:01:57] <%Intersceptre> Rebb is a 10, this game is a dead 5
[3:01:59] <%natebud> Unlike all the other RE protagonists, Billy just went home, instead of dedicating his entire life to revenge against Umbrella
[3:02:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> careful Pat
[3:02:13] <+BizarreRevolver> will we even get an RE8?
[3:02:14] <Ipsenscastle> They should make a game where Billy and Steve and Carlos team up like a lame zombie-fighting boyband. It'd be like FFXV!
[3:02:15] <%SoFarFetched> @Cynical2DD he mentioned before he started the RE marathon what he's gonna play in order. Then he added them to his description so people will know.
[3:02:20] <rytisone> Billy is just chilling on the beach
[3:02:20] <Essixian> @natebud So what you're saying is he's a coward who pussed out
[3:02:22] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate He needs to look like RE5 Chris. Like a living brick wall.
[3:02:23] <%logoth_> I bet after this whole thing ended, Billy still wears his single handcuff to look cool
[3:02:26] <%Sir_stride> @ipsenscastle I'd play it
[3:02:29] <+VoytekBus> always with the chess
[3:02:31] <Rostichenburg> Everybody in RE has to look like a real person now so we're losing actual character design
[3:02:31] <GandhiTheTerrible> This game is alright, I'd give it a 6
[3:02:35] <%JJCheeker> Hey Pat did you watch picard
[3:02:35] <+SWindleFeD> I do wonder sometimes if this game would've been improved with co-op, like I doubt it would've but I still like to think about it
[3:02:38] <%StaceMcGate> @King_Wolf_Rigger I'd take roid Chris over that one any day
[3:02:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> flame rounds, makes sure to save those for the Church boss
[3:02:44] <Cynical2DD> I asked someone earlier what other games Pat is going to play, and I don’t remember him mentioning RE7
[3:02:52] <%natebud> @Essixian Never! Billy'
[3:02:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> also, be very careful which you move
[3:02:58] <%aishman> Man why is with CVX, and RE:Zero's obsession with THE MANSION?
[3:03:03] <%natebud> billy's got his prorities in order
[3:03:04] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate But, he punched boulders.
[3:03:05] <%Sir_stride> @cynical2dd hes playing all the mainline RE games
[3:03:06] <%lionandfox21> @BizarreRevolver There was a leak recently stating that its in dev but was scrapped for whatever reason cause the remakes made a lot of hype
[3:03:10] <Essixian> @aishman LOOK AT THIS ONE
[3:03:11] <%Sir_stride> re7 is a mainline game
[3:03:12] <%StaceMcGate> Was Picard bad? Will RLM destroy it in their next review?
[3:03:12] <%Intersceptre> It's a 0 or a 10, but fluctuates
[3:03:15] <GandhiTheTerrible> because its the mansion
[3:03:19] <+machshop> FART GAS
[3:03:19] <Zaphire_Saucypants> that's why I said be careful
[3:03:20] <%MelBrooksKA> @aishman Because WHAT A MANSION
[3:03:21] <%logoth_> Barf gas!
[3:03:21] <rytisone> get smoked
[3:03:21] <%SoFarFetched> @Cynical2DD probably forgot to mention cause well it's pat LUL he forgets things sometimes always good to look at the schedule.
[3:03:22] <DracaenaLeaf> Fartgas
[3:03:23] <+mattymcfilth> apatLiz
[3:03:24] <GandhiTheTerrible> OH NO
[3:03:24] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Not the FART GAS
[3:03:24] <+RainFerret> board doesn't match
[3:03:24] <%suikudo> RIP
[3:03:24] <oniwahoo> Oh snap, Rebecca in a hat, bet Pat's happy now
[3:03:24] <%RubberFistFight> KRYPTONITE FOG
[3:03:25] <+PanicSwytch> LUL LUL LUL
[3:03:26] <%StaceMcGate> Fartgas

[3:03:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> gotta checkmate
[3:03:40] <DracaenaLeaf> oh no stinky

[3:03:54] <%tiaramaki> What a great game 4Head
[3:03:56] <+PanicSwytch> How can this be
[3:03:56] <chronoxgp> HURRY UP PAT!!
[3:03:58] <oniwahoo> Poison Gas?! God damnit, Steve
[3:04:00] <%lionandfox21> YIKES
[3:04:00] <%peachy996> Not since Omikron have you been this at a loss
[3:04:01] <+feels_anime_man> @AngriestPat how much anime is too much anime? :)
[3:04:02] <%Sausious> what is it with RE and chess
[3:04:02] <%Garthunox> @cynical2dd then theres your problem
[3:04:02] <%Niney_Who> Pat Injured
[3:04:04] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah it sucks, I know
[3:04:07] <majindusto> PAT!!!!
[3:04:10] <%natebud> you did the puzzle bad
[3:04:10] <%Sir_stride> pat sounds broken
[3:04:11] <%templar010> !BRAIN AT RISK!
[3:04:12] <SMuffinMan> Icky-pooey
[3:04:17] <+Estuko> @Garthunox ever listened to the full video? it sounds like he has a gun to his head.
[3:04:19] <%SoFarFetched> @Cynical2DD yeah streamers kinda fuck with people at times so alwys look at schedule for safety.
[3:04:21] <%rj1771> "But Why?" Because you don't Chess, scrublord! barbToxic
[3:04:22] <+Jokobeast> Just huff all that fart-gas on the breeze
[3:04:23] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat are you missing Code Veronica?
[3:04:24] <Cynical2DD> Well don’t get mad at me cause I got my info wrong
[3:04:25] <+SWindleFeD> Don't you have to solve the chess puzzle while the poison gas is filling the room?
[3:04:29] <%JJCheeker> Elmo is so cute I just want to hold him
[3:04:34] <%peachy996> Soldier through it Pat, You get to play RE4 after you flush this
[3:04:36] <+BizarreRevolver> based on the popularity of the remkaes i wouldn't be surprised if a new timeline starts that branches from REmake 3
[3:04:38] <%RubberFistFight> @peachy996 to be fair, Omikron broke hard several times rather than let them beat the boss. Like the time it clipped all the way into the wall and kept hitting them, but they couldn't hit it.
[3:04:38] <JoelFleran> god its so dull
[3:04:42] <%Intersceptre> I was gonna watch vod but eff that, this is live torture.
[3:04:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @SWindleFeD Not if you get it right
[3:04:47] <twistedj3ster> the casing bouncing off the wall is a cool detail actually
[3:04:48] <%akumakins> He almost got ya
[3:04:48] <%Sausious> at least you can see the screen in this game
[3:04:51] <%PauliusMaximus> no the chess peice you need to move has no gas vent under it
[3:04:54] <%akumakins> Oops

[3:05:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Are you?
[3:05:30] <Essixian> It might work if you use the power of Wolf Force, Pat.
[3:05:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You can do it, Pat-o
[3:05:33] <sakeydo> nice hickey billy
[3:05:34] <%Garthunox> @peachy996 DURING THE SYMBOL PUZZLE!

[3:05:40] <42nfl19> isnt pat just making the game longer for himself?
[3:05:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I believe in you.
[3:05:42] <%Sir_stride> pat. with someone who has mind goblins themselves, I understand
[3:05:42] <Decoyhound> this just needs liquid snake mocking you

[3:05:53] <%JJCheeker> I almost miss cvx
[3:05:54] <+SWindleFeD> At least he's not playing dead aim or survivor
[3:05:55] <%Roundelay11> but the good ones are REALLY GOOD
[3:05:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @RubberFistFight That game kills me. I can't believe there were people defending it in the comments lol.
[3:05:58] <+PanicSwytch> Why did u LP this?
[3:06:00] <chisanakitsune> Blasphemy
[3:06:01] <%LunarRemix> Every franchise that has as many games as RE will have some losers
[3:06:02] <Ipsenscastle> like how the vast majority of Star Wars sucks now
[3:06:02] <%lionandfox21> Goes to show the sheer power of RE2 and RE4
[3:06:04] <mankeytennis> RESIDENT SAVE-SCUM
[3:06:05] <%NWR_James> But then it has the best games, like Operation Raccoon City
[3:06:06] <rytisone> should've just played Darkside and Umbrella Chronicles to catch up
[3:06:07] <%peachy996> Better track record than Silent Hill...I think?
[3:06:09] <%Intersceptre> CVX was unwatchable, dark and dull. The BEST go sleep LP ever
[3:06:09] <Essixian> Everyone in favor of Wolf Force say VoteYea
[3:06:10] <%akumakins> Playing them back to back makes the flaws and repeated ideas very glaring.
[3:06:13] <majindusto> SCUM!

[3:13:20] <%tiaramaki> @natebud The format is so cramped, I'd prefer to read a paragraph as long as it takes up more of the screen
[3:13:21] <bugsmr> beloved leeches=chat

[3:13:59] <%Vikken141> ELIMINATE
[3:14:02] <+VoytekBus> its gonna be real weird when you find Albert hiding in a can the whole time
[3:14:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> saaaave
[3:14:06] <Ipsenscastle> This guy sucks leeches back
[3:14:09] <%akumakins> The Molded looked like someone spilled tar on the cookie monster.
[3:14:09] <Essixian> @rytisone No way, Rebecca is a power bottom. I will not accept any other reality.
[3:14:11] <RevolverBobkat> it gets worse?
[3:14:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> becpack saved the day
[3:14:14] <%Aydarkzero> worst part of the game so far Kappa
[3:14:19] <%Keyd00d> Pat do the bat wing
[3:14:26] <%lionandfox21> @RubberFistFight Besides every chemist knows things gotta be blue
[3:14:29] <%natebud> It all gets much better once you fight the big bat
[3:14:35] <+ahdurian> if thats the bat wing, where's the bat mobile?
[3:14:36] <%Decoyhound> bat wing corona virus confimred
[3:14:40] <+Jokobeast> Wait, did we only read like a single page and the rest were hollowed out for that wing?
[3:14:44] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @lionandfox21 Actually weird enough, its very common to put dyes and oxidizing agents that wont catalyze reactions into reagents to easily denote them. Worked as a technician in a medical instrument facility where we denote 4 key reactants in surgical steel with dyes. It sounds like dumb video game shit, but its actually real life dumb shit
[3:14:45] <majindusto> SOMEBODY'S GETTING FUCKED!!!! lol
[3:14:46] <%tiaramaki> You... diiid iiiiit
[3:14:49] <%Aydarkzero> amazing

[3:14:56] <Zaphire_Saucypants> save
[3:14:56] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> How is this part worst that any other part?
[3:14:58] <mankeytennis> Bats ain't evil, they cute af
[3:15:02] <%leinadtonu> why you hate it?
[3:15:03] <%Vikken141> hate them monkies
[3:15:18] <+ahdurian> dont you hate a lot of things?
[3:15:20] <JoelFleran> save
[3:15:21] <rytisone> equip the bananas
[3:15:25] <%natebud> At least hate is emotion better than boredom
[3:15:27] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Just do it good idiot
[3:15:29] <chronoxgp> i remember them almost quitting at the hole in the floor
[3:15:31] <twistedj3ster> I love how you can just leave shit all over the mansion
[3:15:34] <+Buttsong> if only they could be eliminated from the game
[3:15:39] <%Decoyhound> junction ultima majic
[3:15:39] <Azathotic> @XeroSigmaPrime That makes a lot of sense actually. Thanks for sharing!
[3:15:41] <thatd00doverthere> I don't know anything about RE zero so who is this guy that looks like fake Wesker
[3:15:46] <%Master_Van> Is this the monkey dungeon?
[3:15:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> yeah
[3:15:54] <mankeytennis> Chimpy time?
[3:15:55] <+StrawberryPantsu> Don't fall asleep Pat
[3:15:59] <%akumakins> I hate how this game doesn't have item boxes. All trash on the floor kills me inside.
[3:16:01] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @lionandfox21 I literally have "Dont mix anything that touched blue with green unless its mixed with yellow" stuck in my head for eternity because of this dumb shit
[3:16:03] <%Intersceptre> Eliminator is the coolest name for the shittest enemy
[3:16:06] <Essixian> I think what little remains of Pat's motivation to play this game is about to be Eliminated.
[3:16:09] <%Chichen> yah and?
[3:16:10] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> This game refuses to stay in my memory. I've beaten it, watched your LP, and am now watching and yet, beyond the stupid train, I remember nothing.
[3:16:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> No, nevah.
[3:16:10] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[3:16:11] <%natebud> Saw the elimantors in half with lasers to stop them from turning into Crimseliminators

[3:16:57] <%jorniev> YOU BETTER SUPLEX EVERY PRIEST PAT
[3:16:58] <%leinadtonu> Do you like RE 4 pat?
[3:16:58] <mrshazboto> Just watch an any% speedrun of RE Zero and pretend you're playing
[3:16:59] <%StaceMcGate> SPOODER
[3:17:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and then you'll play RE6 and hate it even more, I'm sure.
[3:17:00] <%peachy996> Until you play it
[3:17:06] <majindusto> SPODER!!!!
[3:17:06] <%Tracazoid> So are you slotting the Revelation games in timeline or release order? If you're playing them.
[3:17:07] <dukenux> until you play it LUL
[3:17:07] <Essixian> I CAN'T WAIT FOR ASHLEY TO BE ALL LIKE MMH LEON LEMME JUMP ON THAT SUCCULENT DICK MAN CMON BUDDY
[3:17:08] <%Decoyhound> SPOODER NOOOOO
[3:17:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cuz Hindsight is a bitch
[3:17:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Capcom just released a patch to make R4 bad LUL
[3:17:11] <fabo_joyful> is this the worst one?
[3:17:13] <Huntercd> Monkey ears Ashley
[3:17:15] <sakeydo> You would think a mansion like this is silly. Then you remember in real life they just discovered a new room in that fucking Winchester house!
[3:17:16] <%Keyd00d> You'll appreciate it til you play the fucking Chris campaign
[3:17:17] <%Niney_Who> They just trying to catch food pat
[3:17:17] <Loarfy> lmfao the spiders just kind of look at you
[3:17:22] <%peachy996> You appreciated Zero back when you were suffering CVX
[3:17:22] <+Estuko> Rebecca: doodStare
[3:17:24] <%natebud> RE6 is one of those games you think fondly of until you go back to it and remember all the bad parts.
[3:17:25] <%Sir_stride> yeah
[3:17:26] <SMuffinMan> 6 is okay, story is just dumb
[3:17:26] <TCCBros> your absured
[3:17:31] <+PanicSwytch> Ur making it look worse than what it is Pat
[3:17:33] <+ktothec99> RE6 is kinda fun to play. It's just real real dumb with bad QTEs
[3:17:38] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> That's normal for RE though, being able to run past multiple enemies.
[3:17:40] <%JJCheeker> I'm actually excited for RE 6 because I never play it
[3:17:41] <King_Wolf_Rigger> 6 was the best
[3:17:46] <%lionandfox21> @XeroSigmaPrime I wish I could color code my stuff my life would be easier
[3:17:47] <%Keyd00d> He doesn't care
[3:17:49] <%natebud> Apahty will defeat the goblins
[3:17:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you pat?
[3:17:57] <%Decoyhound> he doesent care?
[3:17:58] <majindusto> Appreciating RE6? lol
[3:17:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> 6 is a personal favorite
[3:18:01] <%StaceMcGate> This will be like a 30 sec discussion on the Podcast. "Game is boring"
[3:18:05] <$dyslexicwizrad> it's balanced. you get a jump scare and then you already know
[3:18:10] <+Jokobeast> @ktothec99 I'd argue 5's were worse. At least you had something of a fighting chance to do the QTEs in 6.
[3:18:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> probably just the illusion of limitation
[3:18:14] <Essixian> @natebud No matter what anyone ever says about RE6, Jake punching Ustanak in the fucking face is the hypest shit ever
[3:18:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> adding to stress
[3:18:17] <+idyota> because they were grandfathered in
[3:18:18] <%akumakins> :<

[3:18:41] <zeroraider> Maybe its because spooders are so non threatening they just slap poison on to their attacks
[3:18:47] <+ktothec99> @Jokobeast I don't like them in any game but you are correct there

[3:30:00] <%Intersceptre> oh shit its RE5
[3:30:02] <%Aydarkzero> it was a setup!
[3:30:02] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> I wish I had an Elmo to forget to ignore this bullshit with.
[3:30:03] <Asuxley> is that why RE5 is located in Africa? to tie in RE0?

[3:30:18] <%lionandfox21> Would be cool if this game gets remaked, that this portion refers to Kijuju

[3:40:27] <%Aydarkzero> @majindusto fan service
[3:40:29] <+DRAGKUDO> so what's the reason for Zero being so different from Remake?
[3:40:41] <%natebud> Rebecca is like a black hole of personality
[3:40:44] <%Chocolatevgz> something something experimental systems
[3:40:44] <Essixian> @TomDanksEGOT I don't know who that is but he's clearly hot
[3:40:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> definitely bring molotovs for where you're goin with that wind key

[3:41:28] <%luftraumm1> apatBougie
[3:41:40] <oniwahoo> It's a shame Pat doesn't have all his healing cocaine from REmake
[3:41:42] <%RubberFistFight> Oh shit, an hour ago a headline went up that scientists have identified no less than 4 species of sharks. THAT CAN WALK. So us land animals are basically fucking fucked. @AngriestPat
[3:41:42] <%Chocolatevgz> I forget, did they make Rebecca's basketball outfit from the creepy photo from Wesker's desk
[3:41:43] <Zaphire_Saucypants> mmmmm
