[0:11:32] <%Shampoohyay> Shampoohyay subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Hey Pat, enjoy the game. As you'll see, IW have added some BLM support messages throughout the game. Predictably, that has woken up some real shitheads. If you haven't already, I'd suggest turning on streamer mode in Options > Account to hide them.
[0:11:33] <crassplay_> trials is live currently
[0:11:38] <l33tc4k3> i uh... don't even know what crucible even is

[0:12:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hero shoots
[0:12:43] <+Dr_DangerPhD> there's a decent game underneath crucible, but its just so much jank that there's zero point
[0:12:44] <segbas2004> it's like 4v4 with random map objective?
[0:12:44] <GrumblePlays> I couldn't tell Crucible apart from any other hero shooter tbh
[0:12:44] <%Agami23> hey pat, just got into heavensward
[0:12:47] <crassplay_> I hate hero shooters
[0:12:49] <%blastazoid26> "like an anime fan on prom night"
[0:12:49] <segbas2004> I'm not even sure
[0:12:49] <%Binary_Fireball> mixed reviews basically say 50% of people did not like which means there is a roughly 50% chance that you will not like it which makes it a shitty purchase
[0:12:54] <%TheZearGuy> Will SFM porn be made of it though?
[0:12:55] <subparSamaritan> Hey Pat cam is back!

[0:15:46] <%Binary_Fireball> and make boom boom
[0:15:47] <%BigLoserJosh> gotta hear the WARzone
[0:15:48] <DesertPenguin> Because the audio is fucked
[0:15:48] <+EdenOfSecondAccount> it is louder to simulate the warzone, pat.

[0:30:05] <sonofthedeepsouth> Hahha
[0:30:05] <marvel877> We're gonna see an uptick in cases next week at earliest.
[0:30:05] <j0ustar> what are masks?
[0:30:07] <DetroitSentai> What?
[0:30:07] <zamzoph> and no social distancing
[0:30:08] <Visorak6> actually untrue tho
[0:30:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[0:30:10] <cureneckbeard> 40,000 people died in the uk!
[0:30:10] <%valriot> Pull down them 5G towers and get yourself some shungite
[0:30:10] <CookieCutter007> monkaS
[0:30:11] <%Ranryu692> We're in the eye of the covid storm
[0:30:11] <crassplay_> I didn't forget, but what am I supposed to do? let cops kill people for fun?
[0:30:11] <DesertPenguin> Most aren't wearing masks or gloves
[0:30:11] <%afronooch> Give us liberty or give us DEATH Pat.
[0:30:12] <$ragingbrachy> WEAR MASKS WHEN YOU GO TO PROTEST
[0:30:12] <%riantDeliration> there's probably gonna be a huge uptick next week
[0:30:13] <+tigerfang86> Big untrue
[0:30:14] <DesertPenguin> It's a shame
[0:30:14] <%redrins> it might actually get worse and thats fucking scary
[0:30:16] <DetroitSentai> All the footage ive seen is masked
[0:30:16] <%DappercatEsquire> Some greater ideals take sacrifice
[0:30:16] <subparSamaritan> Masks are still hard to find here in a lot of places
[0:30:17] <Hessman212> They're predicting large number of cases cause of it
[0:30:19] <%Aydarkzero> it's a HUGE concern
[0:30:21] <%emperordread> people are just THAT pissed off. God save em all
[0:30:21] <+Mkingston> a lot are but masks don't do much
[0:30:21] <mar_krow> dont worry birds aint real so covid aint either jk be safe outside
[0:30:21] <DesertPenguin> It's not everyone, but there's a lot that aren't
[0:30:22] <$PulverKong> like guys....covid is still happening
[0:30:22] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> all seems alittle odd with its timing
[0:30:23] <%logoth_> The eviction riots havent started yet so strap yourselves in
[0:30:23] <czeekyplays> Wear a mask to prevent spread of COVID and thwart facial recognition :)
[0:30:24] <+JoeStillLife> Cops confiscating masks for protestors
[0:30:24] <cureneckbeard> surely a protest is precisely the place to wear masks
[0:30:24] <@commanderclaw> 5-14 day incubation
[0:30:25] <$ragingbrachy> WEAR MASKS AND GLOVES AND SHOWER WHEN YOU GET HOME
[0:30:27] <rissaleigh14> Or wearing them on their chin
[0:30:28] <%delilah4you> some things are worth the risk but yes wear a mask
[0:30:28] <%Mr_Pylon> and the cops are weaponizing that shit by cramming people together in kettling and prison buses
[0:30:30] <T_Sasquatch> If the cases don't explode in a week then covid isn't that bad
[0:30:31] <DetroitSentai> But it's worth it for social reform
[0:30:31] <marvel877> Well, they're ripping them off because they can't breathe from the pepper spray and the tear gas...
[0:30:32] <%deviljhojho_> it wont be ideal
[0:30:32] <DesertPenguin> SHOWER WITH HOT WATER
[0:30:32] <+worldbrand> There are a lot unmasked, but i wouldnt say almost nobody, afaik
[0:30:32] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah with how many people show up,it's IMPOSSIBLE to keep distance
[0:30:34] <+Tyonidus> Good thing I almost never leave my house anyways besides work and am a very well armed free American :)
[0:30:38] <%RoyDaren> i saw a video of a cop spitting on an arrested protester... like... fk.
[0:30:38] <+spacehouse> Not if you use Guerilla TACTICS
[0:30:38] <sonofthedeepsouth> HAHAH WE ARE FUCKED LUL
[0:30:39] <DesertPenguin> I was out, but I wore a mask
[0:30:41] <Kaijuboy> Be a use Covid ain’t real
[0:30:41] <olaksi> Probably shouldn't have murdered a guy in broad daylight during a pandemic huh
[0:30:45] <l33tc4k3> but, i didnt complain about people protesting the lockdown so im not going to complain about this... but it does suck
[0:30:45] <+tigerfang86> Cops are out here STEALING MASKS FROM PEOPLE HANDING THEM OUT
[0:30:47] <%BubbaRands> Please stand 6 feet away from me officer LUL
[0:30:48] <zamzoph> don't worry, health experts said it's okay 4Head

[0:41:56] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt Did you see Rockstar is shutting down GTA and Red Dead Online for a bit for Solidarity instead of like donating to a charity?

[0:42:01] <Visorak6> Theyre lame
[0:42:02] <DesertPenguin> You can get headphones that put your mic audio into your own ears so you don't talk loudly by accident

[0:42:22] <$ragingbrachy> woooooow i feel so welcomed
[0:42:23] <%M4T1A5> It means it's basically "open" all the way so you can hear as much outside as inside, mening you can hear yourself

[0:48:10] <ScreamLord> And they're RIGHT
[0:48:17] <+Mkingston> Pac-Man - take pill and death chases you.
[0:48:18] <Oxybe> FF6 is a game about overthrowing the government from the inside, then creating a death cult around yourself

[0:49:27] <%Atomik456> to be fair ken levine didnt realise he made a game about how evil objectivism is either
[0:49:29] <+eiightbiitt> yup controller ftw

[0:49:48] <%g0atmeal> Can 2 people refuse to fight and hold up the whole match?
[0:49:49] <DesertPenguin> Technically it's not an M4, it's an AR-15. M4 is only the military designation and I think your character is some random guy

[0:54:14] <+Tyonidus> @Shampoohyay yeah in a game like this without dedicated servers and such a low time to kill pretty much all burst weapons are going to be terrible if you don't have Shroud accuracy lol
[0:54:18] <Storm_Samurai> thermal site ftw
[0:54:18] <%blastazoid26> no
[0:54:19] <SkeIeking> M249 unironically one of the best LMGs

[0:54:24] <dan_g_v> the real win is the knife bullets we make along the way

[0:54:50] <+Son_Bruce> @PatStaresAt The glitch is really the gun for you
[0:54:50] <%Shampoohyay> And even then the tick rate is actually pretty good, warzone is at like 55 or something? Which is shocking for 150 players
[0:54:53] <+DontTellPike> @SyCoHacobo11 pistol is suprisingly good, better than two heavy

[0:59:13] <%yoshkosh20> I don't like this game, but the reloading animations are super satisfying
[0:59:16] <%psidefx> reloads like the recluse
[0:59:19] <Cruel_Tentacles> Do any of you know any good low spec PC games? I've been playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and Metal Gear Rising but I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations?
[0:59:23] <%Shampoohyay> What are you kidding? Every fight I've played in Valorant has been instant death for someone, almost every rifle one shots to the head.
[0:59:27] <$ragingbrachy> ?

[1:00:34] <DagumiGoodman> UAV
[1:00:35] <%Shampoohyay> @Melchior_the_Wise From my own research, the M249 jamming from STANAG magazines is a fact of the 90's that was fixed quickly but people just keep parroting it even though it's fine now. It reminds me of people saying the exact same thing about C-MAGs

[1:14:25] <$Afterman_> spray with 0 pray
[1:14:26] <%BigLoserJosh> warm up round. This one is it
[1:14:26] <$RealThiele> legs are only good for explosives

[1:14:35] <rufus2k2> WAIT where is the cube
[1:14:36] <%Shampoohyay> Sensitivity isn't the issue, it's just that Pat made no attempt to control his recoil.
[1:14:38] <+Mkingston> *you're
[1:14:38] <%g0atmeal> Do you get aim assist with controller mode?
[1:14:40] <%PhysicsLB> PatStaresAt himself getting rekt
[1:14:40] <legacy0117> LMG bites at precision, and assault rifle is poor at breaking armor.
[1:14:41] <%tumzfestival> @PaladinDupre It does seem like he wants to make mouse movemts
[1:14:45] <derap41> well yeah
[1:14:46] <czeekyplays> by design
[1:14:47] <+eiightbiitt> oh hey look a cop skin

[1:17:03] <%tumzfestival> :(
[1:17:04] <%Binary_Fireball> it looks like they ripped their logo for their soldier paint
[1:17:07] <czeekyplays> Focusing/Precision reduce the slowdown zone around a player, but increase it when you're on the player IIRC (compared to standard)
[1:17:15] <%Shampoohyay> They have explanations in the menu
[1:17:19] <$ragingbrachy> you look better
[1:17:19] <lloyddboy> that
[1:17:19] <+eiightbiitt> lol
[1:17:22] <%tumzfestival> Is focus just ADS?
[1:17:22] <czeekyplays> The explanations are poor
[1:17:24] <%Shampoohyay> It changes when the aim assist actually activates, either near or far from the target
[1:17:25] <%HRDSalami654> Brand totally cares except when we don't!
[1:17:27] <DagumiGoodman> Makes it easier to control aim when there's a target near your crosshairs
[1:17:32] <%Typhaeon> Focusing is what your camera does every 5 frigging seconds
[1:17:39] <%angel949> big aa while on player, not around
[1:17:42] <%PaladinDupre> makes your aim suck less
[1:17:44] <Jontman42> just click the enemy's head
[1:17:45] <%afronooch> sounds like Destiny's AA
[1:17:57] <+rednecked__crake> aim assist on console is bonkers

[1:18:20] <%tumzfestival> Yeah you want that shit correct
[1:18:21] <%Shampoohyay> The aim assist in MW seems pretty well put together, speaking as someone who slaps console players every day.
[1:18:30] <@commanderclaw> Hoo boy, that's a spicy drop
[1:18:37] <%Shampoohyay> I can't believe that didn't kill you
[1:18:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> improvise!
[1:18:45] <$RealThiele> soft building
[1:18:51] <Jontman42> so you can just fall two stories and be fine huh

[1:30:42] <%ChaosAethr> Letal force was not needed

[1:36:27] <%lethallunacyx> that happens yeah
[1:36:27] <%DappercatEsquire> Buffalo has gone from "that old man tripped and fell" to two officers suspended without pay. Shouldn't need to have video for shit like this.
[1:36:27] <TheArrow_> that gun feels great to use
[1:36:28] <dinnydanny777> Is it a lever action rifle?
[1:36:29] <%terminallyCapriciousz> <3*
[1:36:35] <%Binary_Fireball> are shotguns more realistic in this game?
[1:36:36] <%psydaku> i dont remember
[1:36:36] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> last 5 seconds of the warm-up round, people can't die
[1:36:37] <%PrettyThickandStrongDyck> Does anyone here actually feel bad for those thug cops when someone shoots them for their brutality?

[1:36:37] <esetremendo> That Fallout 3 hitbox amirite?
[1:36:39] <marvel877> ...long range for shooting slugs or something?
[1:36:43] <Nomad_Scholar> @PatStaresAt can you make Felwinter's Lie?
[1:36:45] <SubjectX07x> It's more likely it just looked like a long range sight, plenty of low power optics with the classic sniper scope look.
[1:36:48] <SGrim> @ghostofsolomon high school drop outs have a hard time retaining information.
[1:36:51] <+PR0swagonist> would you ever play with the Yovideogames crew in warzone pat?

[1:37:47] <DagumiGoodman> @ghostofsolomon worse than that is when our president does do things Kappa
[1:37:48] <legacy0117> Slugs are fun, and can break armor easily.
[1:37:55] <SubjectX07x> Pretty sure he straight blasted you in the chest but yes pat, not one shot.

[1:38:50] <benjiFG> i like how the car accelerates before you even get your foot on the pedal

[1:39:06] <+tigerfang86> NOTHING WRONG HERE
[1:39:07] <sexdrugsvideogames> no
[1:39:07] <%Jaxnos> wow they're really chasing like crazy
[1:39:09] <%skelechief> Fun fact: Rubber bullets are considered "Less-than-Lethal" Ammunition, not "Non-Lethal", meaning they can still kill someone but far less likely than regular ammunition!
[1:39:10] <T_Sasquatch> I'm still amazed pat finds solo warzone fun
[1:39:13] <+Elemntion> The road pat, from the road
[1:39:15] <legacy0117> Unfortunately I don't think th his COD game has ammo types. If it did, I'd be all over it.
[1:39:16] <DagumiGoodman> This building is a police station btw
[1:39:16] <%ghostofsolomon> is he still onto you?
[1:39:16] <%DappercatEsquire> @ShichiNoBushi Grab wheel to pull yourself in, land on gas

[1:39:33] <SubjectX07x> @legacy0117 It kinda does.
[1:39:34] <dinnydanny777> Yep Rubber bullets are definitely not non lethal lol, basically any bullet is lethal

[1:39:43] <%TrebassTV> HEAD ARMOR
[1:39:44] <%xcompleasedad> That was a headshot
[1:39:44] <%FusRoDom> Helmet dude
[1:39:45] <+tangoragahn> There a reason you don't just place every landmine you find? Seems like a decent, safe way to fuck over randos
[1:39:45] <sonofthedeepsouth> HMMMMMM
[1:39:46] <CyborgAV> that's some bullshit
[1:39:46] <+R_BChe> armor
[1:39:46] <+UberWolfman> ARMORED
[1:39:47] <%CalderGaming> it was yes
[1:39:47] <marvel877> ...
[1:39:49] <%argavus> ARMOR
[1:39:49] <Visorak6> Thats bullshit
[1:39:50] <%ghostofsolomon> 3 bards of shield if hit head
[1:39:50] <sexdrugsvideogames> it was
[1:39:50] <%king_wragles> Silenced snipers kinda blow, irrc
[1:39:51] <%xcompleasedad> BAD SNIPER
[1:39:51] <%Shampoohyay> Only the HDR, AX-50, and K98 can kill in one headshot

[1:39:51] <czeekyplays> Body armor
[1:39:52] <$ragingbrachy> no :)

[1:39:52] <wrightlight94> cohhAim
[1:39:52] <$RealThiele> helmet big save
[1:39:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Even blanks can kill you if you put the gun to your head
[1:39:53] <%ChaosAethr> ARMOR
[1:39:54] <%Starotter70> It was his shadow clone
[1:39:54] <%argavus> always get a chance
[1:39:54] <%ghostofsolomon> bars*
[1:39:55] <%Mister_McDerp> dragunov doesn't one shot
[1:39:56] <j0ustar> Yeah that was unfair, even with armor
[1:39:56] <Visorak6> BAD DESIGN
[1:39:58] <+tigerfang86> I guess the shields ate it all
[1:39:59] <+Elemntion> Did they nerf the dragunov?
[1:39:59] <%xcompleasedad> REAL DOO-DOO SNIPER
[1:39:59] <%Tearonex> @PatStaresAt Dragonov sucks
[1:40:00] <%blastazoid26> bad sniper
[1:40:02] <+Vancoolness> No fmj
[1:40:02] <%skelechief> PRO-TIP: If you get behind someone and hold the melee button you do a Halo-esque execution
[1:40:02] <%Aeoneth> yeah that was bullshit
[1:40:05] <dinnydanny777> SVD fires really fast I think at least
[1:40:05] <DagumiGoodman> This is why helmets were invented
[1:40:06] <+PR0swagonist> good ol bad tick servers
[1:40:07] <+tigerfang86> oh the sniper was bad too?
[1:40:08] <sonofthedeepsouth> ALTHOUGH YES HELMETS EXISTS
[1:40:09] <+tigerfang86> wew lad
[1:40:11] <Storm_Samurai> skulls are hard ok
[1:40:12] <%Shampoohyay> >the semi-automatic rifle should kill in one shot to the head, this is bad design!
[1:40:14] <%Shampoohyay> yeah okay
[1:40:19] <SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie blanks can kill from 5 feet if aimed at the eyes.
[1:40:27] <+bustawof> dragunov is pretty shitty
[1:40:28] <$RealThiele> counter-snipe inc
[1:40:28] <%CalderGaming> videogame rifles lol
[1:40:29] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> has pat won a game of warzone et?
[1:40:33] <dinnydanny777> You can fire it really fast
[1:40:35] <SubjectX07x> @legacy0117 Certain guns have alternate magazines that change the type of bullet they use, namely things like the AUG can do either 9mm or 5.56, the Uzi has a .41 Action express magazine, and the M13 has an option for .300 blackout.
[1:40:38] <%argavus> you gotta hit
[1:40:39] <legacy0117> FMJ, Fire, Explosive, stabilized, and Sabot.
[1:40:43] <czeekyplays> poor guy lol
[1:40:46] <sonofthedeepsouth> BEHIND YOU PAT
[1:40:50] <GarbageQueenEllie> @SGrim Talk about a magic routine gone wrong
[1:40:51] <SGrim> Nice shootin' Tex KKona
[1:40:53] <DagumiGoodman> I love that you're in the same spot as the guy you killed.
[1:40:55] <%ghostofsolomon> i just think the druganov is not great
[1:40:55] <dinnydanny777> Look out for any rockets
[1:40:57] <%Shampoohyay> I like to use the Dragunov for quickscoping, but that's not really viable in WZ; it doesn't really have much of a function here.
[1:40:58] <DagumiGoodman> History repeats itself
[1:40:58] <%Aeoneth> Stands directly on hte spot he JUST shot a man on
[1:41:00] <SubjectX07x> Also some shotguns have dragons breath.
[1:41:01] <%crimsonharvest> I tried gamepad for like 20 minutes yesterday and its like playing a different game its so ez
[1:41:09] <%D3rrtyD4n> atpTryAiming peek

[1:41:20] <%ghostofsolomon> see it take so much ammo
[1:41:20] <%CalderGaming> reposition
[1:41:21] <%Jaxnos> is this man taking up the same position he just killed someone in? the absolute madmin
[1:41:22] <%argavus> you gotta hit
[1:41:22] <ha2ken> Wasting his armor tho
[1:41:22] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> wow, he survived 1 shot after armor
[1:41:23] <$ragingbrachy> that a god of a gamer
[1:41:24] <%Starotter70> He really put effort into that slide
[1:41:25] <DagumiGoodman> nyoom
[1:41:27] <+iWriteOutLoud> Par
[1:41:28] <%xcompleasedad> REAL bad sniper
[1:41:29] <$RealThiele> snaaaaaake
[1:41:30] <btandoo> fire at the PERSON
[1:41:30] <%emperordread> Sometimes I wonder about if Chauvin knows how fucked up shit is, and that he's the catalyst for it. That his name is reviled across the free world and that every american hates him
[1:41:31] <DagumiGoodman> haha slide go fast
[1:41:31] <SGrim> @GarbageQueenEllie hot gas and barrel spalding in the eyes ain't a clean way to go.
[1:41:33] <%Binary_Fireball> pee shooter
[1:41:35] <%argavus> mabey you suck?
[1:41:37] <%D3rrtyD4n> pat on the hunt
[1:41:38] <+Elemntion> It rewards good aim
[1:41:41] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> need heavier hits like the Kar
[1:41:46] <+Elemntion> Its not THAT bad i mean
[1:41:47] <%Shampoohyay> Two headshots will kill but, well, Pat.
[1:41:48] <+kapcommunist> sorry pat but im rooting for that epic man now
[1:41:49] <SubjectX07x> Well, you're not gunna get explosive rounds, unless we're counting the rounds in the purchaseable bundles that add the dismemberment effect.
[1:41:51] <%ghostofsolomon> be careful pat
[1:41:56] <%Tearonex> Dragonov is the worst sniper in the game IMO
[1:41:57] <%NovaKnightmare> @emperordread and yet some still defend him for some goddamn reason
[1:41:58] <$RealThiele> "it rewards good aim" *pat never rewarded*
[1:41:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> awesome
[1:42:04] <%xcompleasedad> @Elemntion He got a headshot, and it didn't kill
[1:42:09] <DagumiGoodman> pew haha
[1:42:11] <DagumiGoodman> plink
[1:42:12] <%ghostofsolomon> @Tearonex AGREED!
[1:42:13] <Jontman42> I guess a wire climbing thing is standard
[1:42:13] <%Shampoohyay> The XM109 is a sniper rifle that will probably be added next season, which fires 25mm grenades. That'll be something.
[1:42:29] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> what's his killstreak thing?
[1:42:34] <dinnydanny777> Can you get the massive stupid 50 caliber sniper rifle that blows up cars
[1:42:37] <sexdrugsvideogames> window man
[1:42:38] <$RealThiele> 12th place, 5 kills
[1:42:39] <%Shampoohyay> He has a trophy system, which destroys grenades.
[1:42:40] <Jontman42> these games really just are military tech masturbation huh
[1:42:43] <btandoo> what's the deal with battle royale
[1:42:43] <legacy0117> It will, and tons of people will hate it in squads.
[1:42:44] <SubjectX07x> @Shampoohyay I am very skeptical of that thing, a semi auto AX50 essentially sounds busted as shit.
[1:42:45] <+Elemntion> Yeah i know he did, its really a marksman rifle and the mk14 doesnt one shot headshot
[1:42:54] <%emperordread> @NovaKnightmare really? That's fuckin nuts. Surely anyone knows that's a bad thing to actually do, and worse admit
[1:43:07] <+Elemntion> its under snipers but lets be real, its a marksman rifle
[1:43:08] <%Tearonex> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries It's not a killstreak, it's equipment, a trophy system
[1:43:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> its like metal gear solid
[1:43:11] <%Shampoohyay> I agree, but that's what they're adding apparently. I sort of expect it to come with the .50 BMG barrel as standard, and 25mm will be a conversion kit.
[1:43:15] <+iWriteOutLoud> Waiting for Crazy Talk to activate and end Corona.
[1:43:15] <%EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> got it
[1:43:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> I remember a Law and Order Criminal Intent episode where dude shot a guy point blank in a hold-up and seriously acted as if he didn't kill him b/c the gun had blanks in it
[1:43:32] <dinnydanny777> Pat please do Crazy Talk the coronavirus
[1:43:41] <%Starotter70> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[1:43:41] <SubjectX07x> @Shampoohyay I'd be kinda okay with that, with 25MM having severe drop off at range or something.
[1:43:42] <%crimsonharvest> you cant trick crazy talk
[1:43:42] <%maenos2> just got back, are ya winning, pa5
[1:43:45] <%CalderGaming> Jose Canseco just pledged to create a robot army that will cleanse the earth of all corruption when he becomes president

[1:44:11] <T_Sasquatch> I love a good cleansing
[1:44:13] <%Shampoohyay> Yeah, that and it should be pretty inaccurate; in reality anti-materiel rifles just aren't as accurate as sniper rifles and you can only make a projectile that gigantic fly so cleanly.
[1:44:16] <%skelechief> Truck is unironically the best weapon in the game
[1:44:16] <%Ner234> Do vehicles blow up or do they just stop working?
[1:44:16] <%CalderGaming> @Thetruestblacksun no
[1:44:18] <dinnydanny777> This reminds me of Go Vacation
[1:44:18] <%DappercatEsquire> @GarbageQueenEllie Pretty sure actors have made the same mistake

[1:48:24] <%Shampoohyay> @legacy0117 Yeah, and the AX-50 in the game is pretty true to life as an anti-materiel rifle. But the XM109 fires 25x59mm GRENADES. It'll hit a tank, but not so much a person accurately.

[2:27:07] <olaksi> Their gamerscore is bigger than yours
[2:27:09] <%DesertPenguin> Aim straight down

[2:27:16] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave Is it really? I've never been through the Meridianum before. Still doing the MSQ myself.
[2:27:16] <legacy0117> You, first off, stop landing on rooftopssssss
[2:27:20] <%notgarza> woolieACCIDENT
[2:27:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> dive harder
[2:27:22] <ScatterCatt> Are you just looking straight down? Cause you also have to press forward on the left stick, too.
[2:27:23] <benjiFG> their nipples are out
[2:27:23] <%DesertPenguin> And yea, don't land on the rooftops
[2:27:24] <nepwar> it uses the gyroscope so you gotta jerk the controller real good
[2:27:27] <dinnydanny777> They shoot backwards to propel themselves forwards
[2:27:27] <Cruel_Tentacles> Your pp too smol
[2:27:27] <$RealThiele> can you flicker the parachute mid-air?
[2:27:29] <$ItsRatman> Scream while diving
[2:27:31] <+bustawof> they might have jumped out earlier than you
[2:27:33] <%DesertPenguin> Press forward on left stick
[2:27:35] <$ragingbrachy> SourPls
[2:27:36] <%emperordread> Check the bottlecaps of promotional bottles of Mountain Dew for the boost you need
[2:27:37] <arkv01> pretty soon you won't even get to touch the ground pat, the c4 they planted in your explodes mid chute
[2:27:40] <Azathotic> Use your afterburners
[2:27:46] <%WhereIsWill> pop the chute once
[2:27:46] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt Maybe spinning while falling? beats me
[2:27:51] <nepwar> just press and hold all the buttons
[2:27:52] <$RealThiele> use the boost to get through
[2:27:56] <%CalderGaming> I would joke and say "hold sprint" but that almost sounds plausible
[2:27:58] <+eiightbiitt> hey paige could your butt pain possibly be a hemroid?
[2:28:01] <+Payaso426> OPEN CHUTE AND CLOSE REPEATEDLY
[2:28:04] <$Dakuu75> you don't go faster just by pressing forward.
[2:28:05] <dinnydanny777> Shotgun
[2:28:09] <legacy0117> Rooftops, they attract all the bullets Pat.
[2:28:12] <$RealThiele> gravity is fastest
[2:28:12] <%DesertPenguin> WHen you close the chute you get a boost forward
[2:28:20] <%Lion_kun> I actually want to thank you Paige, I never liked DS2 the first time but seeing you play it made me go back and get an appreciation for the game I never had before. I had never played the DLC before either and boy did I miss out, that's some of the best souls content I've ever played.
[2:28:21] <Thetruestblacksun> Genuine question, what’s happening on pewds side of the pond, what with the whole “gamer word” fiasco?

[2:28:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> Do a flip
[2:28:53] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard mhm! you'll find it is because Praetorium which is one of the final A Realm Reborn thingies is basically a movie with a lot of exp attached. Meridianum is a bit more involved, not hard but requires more. Prae gives more exp for leveling too!! TPFufun
[2:28:53] <Mordox> I like this game
[2:28:54] <+feMC_is_best_girl> big dick energy kill
[2:28:55] <$Dakuu75> this game is semi-realistic the only thing that would effect your landing time is how early you drop
[2:28:57] <%damienlunas> Just don't open your chute 4Head

I've seen Pat go through Praetorium on stream before, but tbh, I just need to get over the anxiety I have regarding this and other stuff. It's part of why I started playing FFXIV to begin with.

[2:36:54] <%skelechief> The BLM screen took out the tutorial video
[2:36:56] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard oml yeah Aurum Vale can be a horrible experience as a WHM. the good news is you should find the lily system for WHM like a saving grace, it's what makes it a little more of a bearable healing class. I LOVE playing that personally compared to scholar or ast, since it has good potency/many different cooldowns to rely on

[2:38:44] <Azathotic> @j0ustar Getting shot, Pat's other one weakness
[2:38:47] <$RealThiele> paige hit him with an apple to learn gravity
[2:38:49] <%weissguard> @Azathotic That's actually fine then, thanks!

[2:39:39] <%chambatron> There are piggy banks on the map
[2:39:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat Buy or wait for drop points to appear
[2:39:40] <%rytyoung> certain points on the map have call in zones for choppers
[2:39:42] <%chambatron> You call them there
[2:39:43] <%DesertPenguin> hahahaha
[2:39:45] <%skelechief> They're on your map or you buy a market from the buy station
[2:39:50] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave Yeah, I haven't even touched Aurum Vale since. I literally levelled from 47 to 50 with leves, I was so done with it.
[2:39:52] <$RealThiele> a wild jeep in its native habitat
[2:39:53] <nepwar> byeeee
[2:39:57] <+Payaso426> or buy balloons like mgsv from buy station

[2:40:21] <$RealThiele> get to da choppa
[2:40:31] <sexdrugsvideogames> go to the chopper
[2:40:32] <+CelioHogane> Team is a group between 2 or 4 people that work together for a single objective
[2:40:53] <Mojo_so_dopezz> Plunder is good to rank up your weapons
[2:41:06] <%weissguard> @Azathotic That's what it would seem anyway, from whenever I saw talk of the other two healers. Not that I would really know, since I heard WHM was simplest and said, "Yep, that's the one."
[2:41:10] <$RealThiele> cash heli
[2:41:28] <$ragingbrachy> 4Head
[2:41:46] <jimmytwofeet> Y U NO SHOTTY?
[2:41:54] <legacy0117> Pat you silly, silly man.
[2:42:11] <dinnydanny777> Get cash money
[2:42:21] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard Hope you don't get it in leveling roulette legit, cause yeah it's hard to touch after that healer viewpoint. shit sucks. Have almost everything to 80, so even though im not a religious girl like. praying also here not to get it ever again, swear. just gonna craft my life away for a while after lol.
[2:42:26] <%TheZearGuy> A grappling hook would really help this game
[2:42:33] <dinnydanny777> Eat the rich then fly away
[2:42:38] <sexdrugsvideogames> foooock
[2:42:42] <%skelechief> Every player is told when you call in a helicopter
[2:42:47] <$Dakuu75> yeaH
[2:42:51] <%spiritofmojave> yeeeep
[2:42:52] <jimmytwofeet> Grappling hooks would help most games mefeels
[2:42:54] <$ragingbrachy> why not you get a team
[2:42:55] <BallerSwagBro9k> Ive gotten 3rd place alone
[2:42:58] <%cylish> yes pat 1v2 is harder
[2:43:09] <+wmeldrum> team is needed
[2:43:12] <jellssssss20> Yeah it does, chat
[2:43:12] <+CelioHogane> @BallerSwagBro9k c'mon don't be that guy
[2:43:15] <dinnydanny777> Just get good lol
[2:43:17] <lloyddboy> PAT
[2:43:20] <nepwar> nah
[2:43:21] <%Starotter70> Maybe
[2:43:23] <$ragingbrachy> nah
[2:43:25] <%Jekado> probably aim at him not next to him?
[2:43:27] <%Spydurman> nah
[2:43:27] <%skelechief> Its good for levelling guns if you drop in to hot zones
[2:43:27] <T_Sasquatch> Just play with a muted chat NotLikeThis
[2:43:28] <Dr_Mooose> I mean
[2:43:31] <antyriku2> yes hitting things is how you kill them
[2:43:33] <%DesertPenguin> Moving your camera?
[2:43:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> @celiohogane hehehehe
[2:43:38] <%bluetocho13> nah just let him escape
[2:43:44] <nepwar> hit him enough so others can get it. its the polite thing to do
[2:43:45] <%Shadicara> Shoot where he's going to be instead of where he's been Kappa
[2:43:46] <%spiritofmojave> Hitting parts can help!
[2:43:49] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> but why can't you git gudder, Pat?
[2:43:55] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave I hear ya. First things first for me: Get WHM to cap. I can worry about other stuff later. Like Tanking.
[2:43:58] <sexdrugsvideogames> the blood looking effect in the scope is probably just the exhaust gases, right?
[2:44:18] <Quilltaz> we need a call of duty ancient warfare where pat just gotta fight everyone bigger and stronger than him with a rock
[2:44:25] <%Shadicara> LUL
[2:44:28] <%DesertPenguin> SO close

[2:44:41] <j0ustar> You tried
[2:44:50] <+Payaso426> YEAH
[2:44:51] <%R3Roundabout> But BABA
[2:45:01] <%DesertPenguin> Just go to the piggy
[2:45:08] <BallerSwagBro9k> BUY IT
[2:45:10] <FutaSnek> @PatStaresAt You use the baloon to prevent people from taking your cash and the Heli comes in randomly
[2:45:17] <+kapcommunist> piggybank or you buy a fulton that lifts out 150K
[2:45:20] <%corgispudmen> press X
[2:45:20] <$ragingbrachy> 🐖
[2:45:26] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard exactly gotta keep goals/priorities and an order to things. that also helps with not losing motivation/breaking from the game. and thankfully tanking is definitely a little easier than healing, and far simpler than DPS role in some cases.
[2:45:35] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Quilltaz I would play a western themed COD with single shot rifles
[2:45:40] <$Dakuu75> buy stations, let you summon a pick up

[2:49:52] <%ghostofsolomon> it is
[2:49:54] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard yeah support in retrospect I think would've been good to start as! you can learn mechanics/mistakes and are basically a key part to the party. in the right hands it's better for progression/helping peeps learn ontop ofc healing. WHM is the best gateway
[2:50:25] <@SoFarFetched> its fine,you're learning the mode
[2:50:27] <BallerSwagBro9k> deposit every 100k
[2:50:36] <+kapcommunist> when you died right after you dropped $0 so i think so

[2:53:54] <Owlboy7> @PatStaresAt you dont need a supressor in plunder
[2:53:58] <dinnydanny777> Can you get a cannon?
[2:54:00] <$ragingbrachy> i dont even know what stocks do for guns. like in real life.
[2:54:03] <$Dakuu75> I don't think you need the stock, use a more usefull attachment, imo.
[2:54:03] <nepwar> get rid of the silencer i think. more dmg
[2:54:08] <DrkJP520> This game is completely free, right?
[2:54:11] <%Binary_Fireball> accuracy and fire rate are big imo

[2:56:12] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard there seriously is nothing like it, being receptive to advice to or just yknow being aware is important! probably why it's so easy those type of experiences to make good friends through it/chill peeps or FCs you meet learnin.
[2:56:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> Plz get the full game guy its rly good
[2:56:13] <%DesertPenguin> If you were with a squad you'd find more enemies to kill

[2:56:33] <%Ranryu692> WIDE AND TO THE LEFT
[2:56:49] <%Bailey__gaming> @PatStaresAt a little tip, if theres a gun you want to unlock an attachment for, make sure that gun is equiped as you are about to complete the bountys, so on the 3rd box of a scavanger or just before the end of Recons

[3:14:00] <neVan0> LOOOOOOL
[3:14:00] <+xmetalicdemonx> yeah team
[3:14:01] <nepwar> thats why you team with chat
[3:14:01] <dinnydanny777> THAT WAS WORSE THAN TEAMKILLING
[3:14:01] <%poohtrailsnailcooch> shitty teamates
[3:14:02] <%Agami23> this is why people hate squads
[3:14:03] <%spiritofmojave> SQUADS HUH
[3:14:04] <Shastafield> LUL
[3:14:05] <BlackermanZX> Jesus christ they are USELESS
[3:14:05] <BallerSwagBro9k> they SAVED THE MONEY
[3:14:06] <LorcaNomad> SQUAD'S A SCUMBAG PASS IT ON
[3:14:08] <$Caped_Eggy> They gotta clear first
[3:14:09] <DrkJP520> that's fucking team wooork
[3:14:09] <@SoFarFetched> Probably cause they're like "Eh he can respawn"
[3:14:10] <$ragingbrachy> DONT HELP THEIR SCREWY ASSES
[3:14:11] <+lucaflowe> Skullgirls finally coming up and MikeZ decided to make an "I can't breath" joke on a stream
[3:14:11] <SolidusA> Pat your but is liking WutFace
[3:14:12] <%DesertPenguin> You were in a bad spot for revival
[3:14:13] <%xeros720> teamwork?
[3:14:15] <%Agami23> switch the something good like runeterra
[3:14:15] <%Aydarkzero> you can't ever trust randoms!
[3:14:16] <%Crimpson> Never team with randos
[3:14:16] <+TheotherKristian> You better shoot those scumbags
[3:14:16] <%DesertPenguin> It was too risky
[3:14:19] <%spiritofmojave> Fuck those guys
[3:14:19] <+kapcommunist> Bauer is the real boos of the squad TehePelo
[3:14:21] <dinnydanny777> TEAMKILLING WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN THAT
[3:14:22] <Gallhint> >expecting randoms to be good teammates
[3:14:22] <weissguard> That guy nearly has 300k
[3:14:23] <@commanderclaw> sipsipRude
[3:14:24] <%emperordread> Everything is awesome when you're part of a team
[3:14:26] <%Starotter70> God, I thought that was Paige
[3:14:28] <$ragingbrachy> tbag them if they get downed :)
[3:14:28] <TheArrow_> i dunno i saw a lot of bullets flying
[3:14:29] <agrippaarpeggio> БУРГЕР ГРАД
[3:14:32] <chidere> Did they ever fix the sound in Warzone?
[3:14:34] <dinnydanny777> Literally left to die
[3:14:40] <Charronia> They came to check on you to loot your corpse, that's great
[3:14:47] <%DesertPenguin> You got some good hits in
[3:14:50] <giandeli> @chidere yes
[3:14:59] <tad4631> Lmao uhnKek uhnKek
[3:15:24] <%weissguard> Is that one dude just trying to get as much cash as possible? Is that something about the game mode?
[3:15:26] <chidere> Really? Thats good it was horrible before
[3:15:34] <%DesertPenguin> Random squads create random scenarios. Sometimes you get some really good players and you do well. Most of them time it's like this
[3:15:48] <Frostilk> LET ME IN!
[3:15:52] <%DesertPenguin> Weiss, that is the entire game mode. Get money
[3:15:53] <nepwar> let meinnnnn
[3:15:56] <garbageheaphound> LET ME IN!
[3:15:56] <%xeros720> psaGib LET ME IN
[3:16:01] <%Starotter70> LET ME IN!
[3:16:04] <%weissguard> That makes sense.
[3:16:19] <$ragingbrachy> THE UAV monkaS
[3:16:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> you dont have too but its recommended
[3:16:44] <%weissguard> So he's playing to the objective then. Still kinda shitty of them to just leave Pat to die, but yeah.
[3:16:49] <%ChaosAethr> Chopper are high risk area man
[3:16:56] <$ragingbrachy> monkaS
[3:16:59] <%DesertPenguin> Because the game sucks
[3:17:05] <%Starotter70> BADA BADA

[3:17:19] <PanicSwytch> I can't believe Paige is still better than Pat in cod
[3:17:19] <%emperordread> They hacked your rig with gamerscore
[3:17:22] <$ragingbrachy> no
[3:17:33] <%spiritofmojave> never
[3:17:35] <Gallhint> imagine doing obj LUL
[3:17:37] <+MrProw> objectives in call of duty?

[3:18:10] <+MrProw> big number or smol objective
[3:18:23] <$ragingbrachy> PepeLaugh
[3:18:23] <%Crimpson> Doing the objective would just make too much sense.. Might hurt their kill streaks
[3:18:25] <$jerf_herf> new keyboard just came in the mail, I've been using on screen keyboard for a week. I can now efficiently shitpost again.
[3:18:31] <dinnydanny777> Imagine how strong your shoulders would have to be to just run through glass

[3:32:15] <%DesertPenguin> This is good. Slowly Pat will warm up to the idea of having teammates. Then he will switch back to Apex Legends and have way more fun

[3:32:25] <%Tearonex> b8
[3:32:26] <+WutangchickeN> suck
[3:32:29] <$ragingbrachy> i care pat
[3:32:31] <nepwar> b8 by afk
[3:32:31] <%maskofmichael> Chat cares for Pat
[3:32:34] <%AKidNamedKiller> come on pat just kill them all
[3:32:36] <%DesertPenguin> Oh really? That sucks
[3:32:39] <+WutangchickeN> apex is ass-pex
[3:32:42] <%DesertPenguin> Thanks for explaining it though
[3:32:45] <%logoth_> Apex Legends is a TERRIBLE SOLO experience
[3:32:46] <chidere> You can play BR SOLO
[3:32:53] <@JustinianKnight> I only liked Apex when playing with Pat or other buds
[3:32:54] <$ragingbrachy> more like ape sex B)
[3:32:57] <%delilah4you> the teamate function in apex is almost nonexistant
[3:32:59] <$jerf_herf> When you come across a locked door you should get a "shoot look" prompt, then when you execute said prompt you'll get a message "that doesn't work."
[3:33:00] <%YakumoYomi> But do it, tho.
[3:33:00] <@JustinianKnight> alone was awful
[3:33:03] <+TheOneCalledRock> yeah solo apex is fucking HORRID
[3:33:03] <%DesertPenguin> Fair enough
[3:33:07] <+WutangchickeN> grapex
[3:33:08] <%Emperor_Machinus> like it killing titanfall 3
[3:33:09] <%CalderGaming> with a controller, you would miss your mouth
[3:33:10] <%bluetocho13> you have friends tho Pat, play with them
[3:33:12] <%delilah4you> i just treat them like sometimes competent AI companions
[3:33:16] <+WutangchickeN> Severus snapex
[3:33:18] <%logoth_> I have 560 hours on Apex and its fucking miserable to solo queue
[3:33:18] <nepwar> is apex that bad on controller
[3:33:21] <jimmytwofeet> WHAT IS.....FRIEND
[3:33:24] <@JustinianKnight> we all kinda fell off it after a month
[3:33:25] <$ItsRatman> Apex was great with my friends... if only my friends still played...
[3:33:26] <TheArrow_> honestly i couldn't either
[3:33:27] <rissaleigh14> I only saw a little of Apex but solo seems like it just sucks
[3:33:27] <+WutangchickeN> crepex
[3:33:28] <dinnydanny777> Nice camouroage
[3:33:34] <dinnydanny777> Working camouflage
[3:33:42] <%DesertPenguin> I was able to find some cool people on the reddits and we have a great time playing together and bullshitting on the headsets.
[3:33:47] <@JustinianKnight> wasnt a bad game tho
[3:33:51] <+WutangchickeN> mind... break...ex. they can't all be winners
[3:33:51] <chidere> yea there is a warzone solo
[3:33:54] <%logoth_> Apex is like gambling with your time. 1 out of every 20 games MIGHT be fun
[3:34:00] <T_Sasquatch> Lfg fucking sucks i hate it so much
[3:34:02] <%DesertPenguin> Solo Apex is definitely rough, but finding a squad is so much fun
[3:34:11] <%DesertPenguin> Duos is basically solos lol
[3:34:14] <dinnydanny777> Where even is your team
[3:34:18] <rissaleigh14> Same reason I’ve only played this solo because I have no friends to play it with
[3:34:19] <@JustinianKnight> I woulda played it more solo for sure
[3:34:20] <+WutangchickeN> just play with woolie.
[3:34:25] <Daxalog> It does sometimes
[3:34:25] <+bugz_munny> There were so many battle royals that came out so fast that I lost all interest in them entirely
[3:34:26] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:34:26] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, I used the ApexLFG
[3:34:27] <%Diana869> yes
[3:34:29] <%logoth_> Duos is NOT solo mode, its the mode where Dbags team on
[3:34:31] <CookieCutter007> LUL he did
[3:34:32] <rissaleigh14> Same

[3:34:40] <%heartlesshealer> they ass
[3:34:43] <legacy0117> Playing solo with a bunch of bots on Warhammer Vermintide 2 is a miserable experience too.
[3:34:44] <%DesertPenguin> @logoth_ It's as close as we'll get LUL
[3:34:44] <Gallhint> because its funny
[3:34:51] <dinnydanny777> Would a grenade kill you?
[3:34:54] <PanicSwytch> U suck
[3:34:54] <%AKidNamedKiller> did you not see the dead guy on the floor?
[3:34:57] <Daxalog> Apex sometimes has a Solo mode. But thats when all the sweaty Wratihs and Pathfinders come out
[3:34:58] <+EyeFarted> You have a VERY shootable face, Pat...
[3:34:59] <+FierceDeityGabe> Does everyone use cold blooded?
[3:35:00] <%DesertPenguin> They said it won't happen because the abilities and whatnot for team play yea yea yea
[3:35:12] <legacy0117> Can't win anything beyond Champion difficulty.
[3:35:13] <Shwepie> They know who you are and want to shitpost on live tv?
[3:35:13] <rissaleigh14> They know you don’t like being shot
[3:35:15] <%arancet> no shoot orb
[3:35:16] <thetruthofyourbeing> POg
[3:35:16] <%maskofmichael> Because you're a big target
[3:35:17] <Gallhint> pat stands for perfectly agreeable target
[3:35:21] <stardustcrusad3r> what will he stare at next?
[3:35:22] <%Emperor_Machinus> because Pat hates getting shot
[3:35:42] <%DesertPenguin> Getting shot is admittedly not fun
[3:35:43] <arkv01> you have soft round flesh pat
[3:35:44] <chidere> Stream snipers monkaS
[3:35:47] <arkv01> the bullets penetrate easy
[3:35:48] <+EyeFarted> DEPOSIT YOUR TIPS
[3:35:55] <@JustinianKnight> I've coincided that multiplayer FPS aren't for me at this point
[3:35:57] <Shwepie> Wouldn't that balloon just give away your position?
[3:35:58] <%heartlesshealer> pat
[3:36:00] <%DesertPenguin> Deposits money so you can't lose that amount?
[3:36:02] <+FierceDeityGabe> Sends funds to mother base
[3:36:03] <%Diana869> stores cash
[3:36:10] <%DesertPenguin> It's like a money checkpoint
[3:36:13] <%AKidNamedKiller> pat is a ding dong
[3:36:14] <thetruthofyourbeing> ballons money away
[3:36:29] <%DesertPenguin> Oh no he's stuck in a stairwell again. THank god it wasn't a tall building lol

[3:38:30] <+bugz_munny> MGS5 is a gameplay masterpiece
[3:38:39] <@JustinianKnight> the story is just a mess
[3:38:41] <%heartlesshealer> F
[3:38:42] <$Dakuu75> awwww
[3:38:43] <+bugz_munny> but the story is meh and people latched onto that the hardest

[3:39:03] <%Jekado> he aimed for your head it seems like
[3:39:05] <@JustinianKnight> also they wasted one of the best vocal themes ever on a car ride
[3:39:07] <+EyeFarted> Hamburger Time
[3:39:07] <%heartlesshealer> shoulda learned from Liam and had your shield out all the time
[3:39:08] <j0ustar> You know, I appreciate the regular ass CoD maps integrated into the greater BR map
[3:39:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> @bugz_munny Exactly
[3:39:10] <Picia000123> MGS5 was great gameplay wise, but it didn't need to be open world, and the story was not great
[3:39:12] <$ragingbrachy> no
[3:39:12] <legacy0117> Riot shield is very nice to have, don't know if it shields your back. Does it?
[3:39:15] <+Aldesso> no he shot him in the face thats why

[3:40:39] <+mecha_sniper_joe> pat looks like a monkey
[3:40:39] <rissaleigh14> The best of floors
[3:40:41] <%Emperor_Machinus> Great floor for coverage
[3:40:44] <%CalderGaming> depends on the game, i dunno here
[3:40:46] <%Aeoneth> You just missed cuz you shot through all the floors
[3:40:46] <Shastafield> cod
[3:40:46] <+bugz_munny> I never played one with a kill cam so I never improved
[3:40:47] <$ItsRatman> How much your sight sways
[3:40:51] <%BubbaRands> THE GRATE(EST) FLOOR
[3:40:51] <dinnydanny777> Aiming stability reduces sway and recoil control reduces recoil?
[3:40:51] <Zekuu69> NA simulator DatSheffy
[3:40:51] <%heartlesshealer> vertical and horizontal most of the time in games
[3:40:52] <@JustinianKnight> like, you *might* get some shots through I guess
[3:40:52] <$Dakuu75> aim stability is when your ADS and NOT shooting.
[3:40:57] <moosemonkey397> sway vs jump
[3:40:59] <$jerf_herf> f
[3:41:00] <olaksi> Recoils is when you are shooting?
[3:41:03] <%barkon345> Holy shit Pat's camera is finally working again
[3:41:03] <%DesertPenguin> Yea
[3:41:05] <%DesertPenguin> It's just sway
[3:41:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> Man fuck this video game
[3:41:12] <+Aldesso> AIming stabiliy hold your gun more steady during aiming. Recoil control makes the gun not go crazy during live fire
[3:41:17] <dinnydanny777> Aiming stability is for snipers recoil control for automatic guns?
[3:41:18] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah you get the recoil when you're shooting
[3:41:19] <%DesertPenguin> stability is just aim sway. irrelevant once you start tracking a target
[3:41:22] <legacy0117> Assault rifles are AWFUL at penetration unless it uses a high caliber round, like the AK.
[3:41:23] <+eiightbiitt> for snipers
[3:41:26] <%DesertPenguin> recoil control is best
[3:41:33] <nepwar> aim stability is for sniper bois
[3:41:41] <nepwar> recoil reduc is for shooty bois
[3:41:44] <%DesertPenguin> Yea, just snipers. But you can hold your breath to steady too
[3:41:46] <@SoFarFetched> if Im sniping more,aim stability
[3:41:48] <+Aldesso> AK is terrible in this COD
[3:41:51] <thetruthofyourbeing> man i miss being in my early 20's playing battlefield 3
[3:41:56] <%DesertPenguin> That's my go to
[3:41:58] <$Dakuu75> Recoil Control, reduces the gun's up'n down kick. Recoil Stability is the gun's left'n right kick.
[3:41:59] <thetruthofyourbeing> feels bad
[3:41:59] <legacy0117> That sucks.
[3:42:01] <%heartlesshealer> I suggest using a sight
[3:42:03] <%fizuth> hybrid is nice 'cause you can swap
[3:42:05] <nepwar> reflex siht
[3:42:07] <kiso52> you can have a zoom one and like a red dot one on the same sight
[3:42:08] <@SoFarFetched> I say hybrid
[3:42:10] <+Aldesso> no sight as you are not engaging enemies at range
[3:42:15] <%AKidNamedKiller> pat go kill poeple
[3:42:16] <legacy0117> I miss Counterstrike AK.
[3:42:21] <+eiightbiitt> fuk it just use an aim bot
[3:42:22] <COLEZILLA> im a fan of integral hybrid
[3:42:22] <$ItsRatman> 4.0 flip hybrid is my goto, but thats just for style
[3:42:25] <%Ninestempest> oh NO PAT @PatStaresAt did you see Mike Z made a, uh, i cant breathe joke on an SG stream
[3:42:27] <%AKidNamedKiller> play gun dressup later
[3:42:36] <%DesertPenguin> Either 4.0 hybrid or the canted red dot
[3:42:39] <legacy0117> Inaccurate as hell, but kills in two or three shots.
[3:42:43] <%heartlesshealer> I was just being an ass, was "sight" a real option under the types of sights?
[3:42:53] <kiso52> @PatStaresAt hybrid has a 4x scope and a red dot on the same sight you can switch between them
[3:42:56] <$Dakuu75> In this mode, I assume most ppl use Cold-Blooded Perk. So maybe not a good time for Thermals.
[3:43:06] <%DesertPenguin> I have a piece of salmon. Would you like a piece of salmon?
[3:43:14] <%heartlesshealer> in the middle of the street

[3:43:27] <dinnydanny777> There's a guy moving on screen
[3:43:43] <%heartlesshealer> wonder why
[3:43:50] <%DesertPenguin> I thought it was Paige's fault?

[3:46:12] <+PenmanLupine> what does Pats life force taste like? Red Bull and piss?
[3:46:18] <%gekizenbu> those accursed lamprey people, taking our blood in our sleep!
[3:46:18] <%maskofmichael> Paige can't take Pat's life force because he has to have one in the first place. Nailed it.
[3:46:19] <DracaenaLeaf> I don't think whatever life force Paige is stealing from Pat is actually being used by Paige tbqh
[3:46:20] <%DesertPenguin> He gone
[3:46:21] <ShichiNoBushi> Succubus
[3:46:23] <%heartlesshealer> she is just a cool lady
[3:46:24] <%AKidNamedKiller> pat dont just stand in the open
[3:46:26] <nepwar> paige succs to speed up the skeleton emergence
[3:46:26] <Shwepie> If Paige plays more Baba is You, she could collect more Pat Orbs.
[3:46:34] <$jerf_herf> because they're heroes
[3:46:35] <T_Sasquatch> What could go wrong if I insult the streamers girl ?
[3:46:36] <%xcompleasedad> This stream has had the worst chatters come out
[3:46:37] <%Shadicara> LUL
[3:46:40] <dinnydanny777> You need to maintain a solid KDR though Pat
[3:46:41] <%Bane_Kaikyo> If Paige is siphoning Pat's life-force, then explain how she's broken all the time
[3:46:45] <%DesertPenguin> Oh yea, makes sense
[3:46:46] <%heartlesshealer> Drain Life
[3:46:46] <@JustinianKnight> Paige the Lich

[3:46:48] <%arancet> suck that orb paige
[3:46:50] <%DappercatEsquire> Psychic vampire or some shit

[3:46:52] <%xcompleasedad> Plutonium pellets?
[3:46:53] <%Shadicara> I just figured you're skeletor Paige Kappa
[3:46:53] <%BigLoserJosh> it's how she stays so youthful lookinh
[3:46:54] <kiso52> sweaty dudes playing like its hardcore search and destroy?
[3:46:54] <%YakumoYomi> Pat's orb constantly regenerates his HP, though, so there's no harm.
[3:46:55] <%heartlesshealer> Lich prep
[3:46:56] <$Trenr> Ass broken, back gone
[3:46:56] <rufus2k2> TOO MUCH MUSTARD
[3:46:57] <%weissguard> Raw BIG DICK ENERGY.
[3:46:58] <legacy0117> No, it means probably that your channel is leeching off Pat's but seriously they are practically a married couple at this point.
[3:46:58] <%spiritofmojave> Your ass broke from rolling the wrong way
[3:46:58] <%CalderGaming> is paige a LICH?!
[3:46:58] <%DesertPenguin> Lifehunt Scythe
[3:46:59] <%Jekado> does she such through the butthole?
[3:46:59] <wrightlight94> Succ the orb
[3:46:59] <@SoFarFetched> only thing Paige is leeching,is Pats life force. It's how she's staying alive this whole time.

[3:47:08] <%arancet> shlrop the orb
[3:47:10] <olaksi> Paige making the rookie lich mistake trying to leech soul energy from another ginger
[3:47:12] <+bugz_munny> Someone find that phylactery

[3:47:15] <rissaleigh14> Paige is not broken, she’s leeching his life force

[3:48:07] <$Dakuu75> Oh I hate that. the mission starts and threat-level is imediately MAX lol
[3:48:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> lupus and vampirism have a lot in common.

[3:48:25] <Sotetsu> Threat level is immediately midnight
[3:48:25] <kiso52> nice shot
[3:48:27] <+bugz_munny> you killed a man
[3:48:31] <rissaleigh14> Threat level gives me anxiety dude
[3:48:34] <%DesertPenguin> I think the integral sight takes less time to switch between scops
[3:48:36] <%nothollowyet> nothollowyet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! You're pretty cool I guess. Take my Bezos bucks.
[3:48:52] <dinnydanny777> Pat killed a man
[3:48:55] <$Dakuu75> hold shit, you can find self-revives!... and the fucking look EXACTLY like the dum stims! I didn't know that
[3:49:00] <%rumtumtugnutz> threat level midnight is a reference to nuclear Armageddon.
[3:49:04] <dinnydanny777> Put the gun against in his head, pulled the trigger now he's dead
[3:49:05] <%xcompleasedad> That stutter, tho

[3:49:47] <%spiritofmojave> it's all our fault the game performs sub par basically
[3:49:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> it's almost like it's hosted on a server somewhere
[3:49:54] <thetruthofyourbeing> POGGERS
[3:49:55] <%spiritofmojave> WE'RE THE LEECHES
[3:50:00] <rissaleigh14> Are we leeching it’s life force?
[3:50:01] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Is Paige not a trenchcoat covering a human shaped pile of leeches?
[3:50:01] <%DesertPenguin> Aculite has some good videos and they show how squad play can work well
[3:50:03] <kiso52> pog

[3:51:00] <%fizuth> psaWhat psaWhat
[3:51:06] <rissaleigh14> Damn
[3:51:06] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yo that guy needs his dick twisted.
[3:51:07] <%DesertPenguin> You can do well without attachments but having them helps immensely
[3:51:07] <%BubbaRands> HAHAHAHAHA
[3:51:08] <$Dakuu75> awwwww
[3:51:15] <%xcompleasedad> That was bad
[3:51:20] <%fizuth> you know people always say BM but I've never known what it means
[3:51:24] <$Dakuu75> that was funny though, the dude just sprinted outa the grenade range
[3:51:25] <kiso52> twist it real good lol
[3:51:26] <%CalderGaming> Bad Manners
[3:51:36] <%DesertPenguin> If anyone here that does play Apex wants some people to squad up with, send me a whisper chat. We'll get some dubs
[3:51:45] <kiso52> merciless pat
[3:51:46] <%CalderGaming> though I first learned it as "Bowel Movement" so it's always funny to see it
[3:51:47] <%DesertPenguin> PS4

[3:52:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> isn't a BM like a poop? like an Elmo egg?
[3:52:14] <rothgarbloodfire> Pat because of you im play runeterra and i made a teemo deck
[3:52:27] <$jerf_herf> this mode is wallstreet the game
[3:52:28] <$Dakuu75> @rothgarbloodfire gross lol
[3:52:33] <%fizuth> bad manners? really? that sucks we should come up with something better

[3:53:01] <%BubbaRands> @rumtumtugnutz a Bowel Movement? Yes BM means two things
[3:53:03] <rothgarbloodfire> stream sniping is grosser than teemo
[3:53:03] <%rumtumtugnutz> @rothgarbloodfire don't blame pat because you decided to play a teemo deck
[3:53:04] <dinnydanny777> "sickest snipe shots in CoD 2020 edition, ft PatStaresAt"
[3:53:09] <thetruthofyourbeing> pog
[3:53:09] <yodajr99> @patrickng714 whats he doing now?
[3:53:11] <%heartlesshealer> @rumtumtugnutz In games, BM is bad manners, like infinite juggling post-match in a fighting game where the game won't move on until the combo stops. IRL a BM is a bowel movement
[3:53:15] <kiso52> yeah i think he should hide his map with himself

[4:02:38] <%DesertPenguin> An Amazon warehouse is ungulfed in flames in LA. Everyone is out and safe, but they don't know how it started and it apparently was already on fire this morning. Oh lord....
[4:02:48] <jimmytwofeet> MY BRAIN SMARTY SMARTS
[4:02:50] <yodajr99> ax-50 is superior
[4:03:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @DesertPenguin Man, I wish i could be ungulfed in flames
[4:03:12] <%Tearonex> Melee damage increase LUL
[4:03:14] <OmegaFatalis> does Pat know about sprinting?
[4:03:15] <%DesertPenguin> Which has less bullet drop, the AX or HDR?
[4:03:30] <%DesertPenguin> I think the HDR is better for slower engagements but AX you be more mobile?
[4:03:41] <%AKidNamedKiller> gj pat
[4:03:42] <Storm_Samurai> Geez that guy was durable
[4:03:51] <%DesertPenguin> C'mon team back him up!

[4:03:58] <%AKidNamedKiller> Dont stand in the open pat
[4:03:58] <+dmtjinni> perfecto
[4:04:01] <%Ninestempest> all in that tent i guess
[4:04:01] <%Ner234> What a manly yell
[4:04:03] <SpaceLTN> 🐭
[4:04:03] <yodajr99> AX I assume cause it has more power to keep the bullet straight longer
[4:04:13] <%DesertPenguin> I think the AX has the bullet velocity, yea
[4:04:16] <+dmtjinni> not bad gg
[4:04:16] <%Ner234> 9th Pog
[4:04:16] <kiso52> you can shoot throught the tents too pat
[4:04:18] <+bugz_munny> AINT FIRST
[4:04:20] <%heartlesshealer> you did good
[4:04:23] <%xcompleasedad> 9th out of how many?
[4:04:26] <%JaundiceJoestar> gj
[4:04:28] <Charronia> Moved up to silver esaGood
[4:04:28] <%CalderGaming> 9th squad out of how many?
[4:04:30] <%DesertPenguin> You're doing good, and as long as you're having fun you're doing great
[4:04:34] <$Dakuu75> which one is more hit-scan-y the HDR or AX?
[4:04:41] <%redrins> top 10
[4:04:43] <%taku_toots> psaUp
[4:04:46] <%CalderGaming> lol
[4:04:46] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah pat's getting better slowly
[4:04:47] <%DesertPenguin> Higher bullet velocity. (assuming you are using good attachments) HDR has a crosshair designed for closer-range shots, AX-50's crosshair is designed for longer range sniping. Both guns could be used and have around the same end results.
[4:04:47] <dinnydanny777> Well done
[4:04:47] <+bugz_munny> You already lost pat, you're not playing to WIN
[4:04:55] <kiso52> perdy gud
[4:05:00] <rissaleigh14> Good job
[4:05:04] <%BubbaRands> not bad
[4:05:21] <%heartlesshealer> good job for real. You did things that round
[4:05:24] <+Fooguwu> if you dont get angry and destroy your room then you've lost twice
[4:05:35] <kiso52> plunder gang rise up
[4:05:43] <%DesertPenguin> Despite a lower bullet velocity than the HDR, the AX-50 makes up for it in reload speeds and ridicule positioning. After every shot, the AX-50 seamlessly recenters on-target, unlike the more long-range-friendly HDR.
[4:05:43] <%Hiro01231> Hiro01231 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! hi
[4:05:53] <+kapcommunist> gotta go get the spoon
[4:06:04] <%DesertPenguin> If you're taking your time with your shots, HDR. If you're going around being aggressive, AX-50
[4:06:12] <$Dakuu75> Pat needs to get the cripple-wheel-barrel to help Paige up
[4:06:17] <%DesertPenguin> I'd suggest the HDR for Pat
[4:06:20] <%weissguard> Does this sound different to anyone?
[4:06:29] <@SoFarFetched> if audio is funky,it might be twitch
[4:06:39] <Gallhint> oh shid new RLM video bye stream
