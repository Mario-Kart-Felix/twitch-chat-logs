[0:16:27] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat which FF char would be Teppo?
[0:16:28] <%FacetiousAF> vivi the truest black mage
[0:16:29] <%lordsdb> I always call him Vivi
[0:16:31] <%badchoice5> Veigar, MASTER OF EVIL
[0:16:34] <Aydarkzero> but what about LightningKappa
[0:16:36] <%WhereIsWill> pats team is mostly AP ADJUST ACCORDINGGLY
[0:16:39] <Gregorhasjoined> wew
[0:16:41] <%FacetiousAF> wait vivi has another name???
[0:16:44] <%Soulbishop> no love for Freya
[0:16:48] <%JohnAtDawn> LUL
[0:16:54] <%ClaudeMcGarren> @FacetiousAF no.....
[0:16:54] <SummonerMagno> stop tenting fate Pat
[0:17:09] <%badchoice5> As though Pat wouldn't do a 20 hour consecutive stream if necessary
[0:17:24] <%Soulbishop> I like the way that Pat's big brain works he knows it's 5 free days for final fantasy XIV so now he's not streaming it at all. @angriestpat
[0:17:28] <$thesickestzak> Cid could be top. Cid could be bot. Cid could be mid. And is probably put Cid as jungle
[0:17:30] <CyprienCole> This isn't Final Fantasy 8
[0:17:31] <Aydarkzero> plague did not seem to enjoy that game LUL
[0:17:41] <Gregorhasjoined> Play Sekiro! I recently fell back into it and man is it chill to just murder folks in
[0:17:45] <%StaceMcGate> What game has Plague enjoyed in the last year?
[0:17:46] <King_thunder365> You've finally returned to this!
[0:17:48] <SquigglyLizard> plague enjoys things in his own way
[0:17:49] <%jepupu> Plague is super critical towards anything
[0:17:49] <@commanderclaw> I want to give Plague a hug
[0:17:53] <TurtlesAndTentacles> he really doesn't... that's sad
[0:17:55] <Skatedeandre> It’s like woolie and sekiro
[0:17:58] <%jepupu> And everything
[0:18:05] <%FacetiousAF> he likesd defenders of oasis!!!
[0:18:08] <SummonerMagno> his shadowbringers lp was an experience
[0:18:09] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> He's not Plague of Likes...i'll leave.
[0:18:12] <CyprienCole> ssjViviThump
[0:18:13] <MassConnect> woolie is convinced he has solved the barf in purse problem
[0:18:17] <%FacetiousAF> ... i'm real good at the typing
[0:18:21] <veraverse> Does Plague like himself?
[0:18:23] <%StaceMcGate> More than Mike?
[0:18:27] <%Piemen99> !uptime
[0:18:28] <Aydarkzero> what a hero
[0:18:29] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 18m 30s.
[0:18:34] <redrins> he's a jaded motherfucker and we love him
[0:18:34] <GarbageQueenEllie> Plague complains to show his love
[0:18:37] <%Piemen99> oh cool im on time
[0:18:40] <DaBigVitus> trek fans in a nutshell
[0:18:41] <Zebroneath> Having been at those streams, this is true
[0:18:42] <%badchoice5> Plague gets double the enjoyment most people do, he gets the enjoyment from complaining, then enjoyment from the thing later when he's alone
[0:18:58] <%FacetiousAF> ff7r???
[0:19:00] <Gregorhasjoined> Star Trek both has incredible highs and amazingly stupid lows. It's simultaeniously the best and worst

[0:30:45] <%RestiveGaming> @StaceMcGate They probably dont even know
[0:30:45] <MassConnect> Patrick Boivon has to be Cid though
[0:30:46] <Aydarkzero> this doesn't even look like me!

[0:31:10] <joylent_blue> berserk/haste i think?
[0:31:17] <%StaceMcGate> Get an actual Indigenous or Native-American actor to voice Red XIII
[0:31:18] <King_thunder365> I wish they had Tifa's voice actor kind of do the thing TFS has Tifa's voice actor do in the FF7MA stuff where she actually SOUNDS more like a badass bartender.
[0:31:21] <%Alpha8087> Forget about that shit, HERE COMES REDBULL
[0:31:24] <%Soulbishop> Pat do you maintain a slack or something similar for productivity to keep things in order in your head or do your mind goblins sort everything for you?

[0:38:53] <MassConnect> yeah but you killed that guy
[0:38:53] <lotharrio> Yeah but you put down his slave rebellion or something, right?
[0:38:56] <PhiZeroOne> I gave up, it was MISERABLE
[0:38:57] <%RestiveGaming> I hope RE3 Remake brings back the Regina Costume
[0:39:00] <%lethallunacyx> you were good to him
[0:39:02] <MassConnect> killing guy = good
[0:39:02] <cascadepersona> @stacemcgate They've done content from IV, V, VI, Ivalice games, XIII, and XV. Based on the coming Weapons bosses, VII might be up next (also because VII Remake is coming soon)
[0:39:03] <veraverse> I can stole the keystone without getting closer
[0:39:03] <NickNackProductions> he wants to see a sweaty twink
[0:39:09] <rytisone> now CHEAT
[0:39:16] <%AbnormalVoid> Stop Cheating, Fuck NotLikeThis
[0:39:19] <+PlagueOfGripes> are you trying to get omnislash
[0:39:20] <PhiZeroOne> NGL getting omnislash is awful
[0:39:22] <CyprienCole> that's what they all say
[0:39:23] <%Im_A_CryBaby> VoteYea
[0:39:27] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[0:39:30] <%devanmuse> "I'll let you have this item if you participate in my bloodsport" wow DIO is just Pat right here
[0:39:33] <Daxalog> I ddint know he got different weapons and they showed up in the battle
[0:39:35] <%StaceMcGate> @cascadepersona I just hope they ain't gonna do a Sephiroth raid, too on the nose LUL
[0:39:37] <%AbnormalVoid> oh, he's not lmao
[0:39:38] <%DedlokPM> Well you didn't sue him after falsely throwing you into jail for murder so you treated him good. teenJOY
[0:39:41] <+captainpeaches> the brave do not fear the grave
[0:39:48] <Skatedeandre> I couldn’t do this to get Omni slash
[0:39:48] <PhiZeroOne> FF7 holds up shockingly well imo
[0:39:50] <%TalekAetem> @StaceMcGate To be fair, Kefka is in it
[0:39:57] <%IMDRanged> IMDRanged subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months, currently on a 35 month streak! Sup, Pat.
[0:39:58] <Skatedeandre> Always kept getting unlucky
[0:40:02] <%VashyronM> I'm always impressed at how the battle graphics hold up compared to the rest of the game
[0:40:03] <%RestiveGaming> Its better to do this earlier rather than later, right?
[0:40:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Sue Sepiroth and take his shit
[0:40:09] <PhiZeroOne> all the PSX FF's actually hold up pretty well
[0:40:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> they do but you die if you file one against the state
[0:40:14] <%StaceMcGate> @TalekAetem Kefka is forgotten by most major audiences, and he worked for Omega
[0:40:14] <Ner234> laws LUL
[0:40:18] <mothdude> Omnislash is still the coolest thing in the world, even all these years later.
[0:40:20] <%Im_A_CryBaby> why sue when you can just rape? SeemsGood
[0:40:27] <%Im_A_CryBaby> oh and pillage
[0:40:30] <%InugamiTheHound> those are cats not frogs
[0:40:33] <%Alpha8087> Plague what up sir
[0:40:38] <AliceAstro> this is pokeman
[0:40:39] <Skatedeandre> Is there even a legal system?
[0:40:39] <PhiZeroOne> I don't mean perfectly, just "shockingly well"
[0:40:41] <%Theastrica> ouch that was quite a scream
[0:40:42] <%drabberfaun535> uptime!

[0:40:53] <Skatedeandre> Jesus Christ
[0:41:04] <Direfirerat5> hey what kinda gross modern day video game practices do you think might seep into the remake, if any?
[0:41:05] <%drabberfaun535> is that an autobot?
[0:41:06] <joylent_blue> monkaS
[0:41:08] <%Alpha8087> Look at that Rick-Dom
[0:41:10] <Daxalog> Oh, your approaching?
[0:41:16] <tigerfang86> shit on 9 to call an airstrike upon your position
[0:41:18] <PhiZeroOne> yeah that is just a Rick-Dom huh
[0:41:18] <%Im_A_CryBaby> it's a decepticon
[0:41:20] <GarbageQueenEllie> @veraverse I mean, that's how I won the Hope Diamond. But DDR is harder than you'd think
[0:41:40] <savagedeviljayho> @Direfirerat5 day one dlc? seems like based on the preorder summons it will have it
[0:41:42] <stolando_florida> I love how when Clumbo gets punched he eats shit and immediately snaps back up
[0:41:52] <%drabberfaun535> !uptime
[0:41:52] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 41m 54s.
[0:41:52] <%RestiveGaming> You think it would be possible to use that AI Upscaling on the HD versions versions of the FF games to clean up the backgrounds?
[0:41:53] <%StaceMcGate> you normally want to be unlucky to get the most rewards
[0:41:55] <%lethallunacyx> 9 is good, Pat just can't stand that everyone is short
[0:41:55] <King_thunder365> That last thing almost looked like a mini-waner
[0:41:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> how come you aren't using the slot buffer trick, you skilless fuck
[0:42:11] <%radda343> you crazy talked your way into a death sentence
[0:42:13] <joylent_blue> pat doesn't like to cheat- oh wait
[0:42:14] <savagedeviljayho> @lethallunacyx Wait Pat doesn't like 9?
[0:42:14] <uncledickbutt> I was procrastinating to play RE3 for 10 years - I guess i play the remake now LuL

[0:42:47] <tigerfang86> notorious positive person, PlagueOfGripes
[0:42:48] <JunjiNeato> pat is right to not like 9
[0:42:52] <%Wurmspawn> Wurmspawn subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! 10 months yeyeye!
[0:42:52] <%InugamiTheHound> Plague will draw tons of tifa when the remake come sout
[0:42:53] <%Alpha8087> OH NO A CLOCK
[0:42:53] <lotharrio> Oh the time death sentence went away
[0:42:53] <%lethallunacyx> @savagedeviljayho he just likes to shit on it cause Paige likes it
[0:42:53] <%IMDRanged> apatWhat woolieVS riffTorgo
[0:42:55] <%RestiveGaming> @PlagueOfGripes Back handed insults instead of answering your question....smh
[0:42:57] <+PlagueOfGripes> cartoon Plague me is not actual me, so it depends on how entertaining you want the answer to be
[0:42:58] <joylent_blue> savagedeviljayho he might just shit on it to annoy paige more than anything, but who knows LUL
[0:43:04] <%radda343> I think the death sentence went away, that's nice of them
[0:43:07] <Make_me_mad> 9 was the best PS1 FF game. Vivi for life!
[0:43:09] <PhiZeroOne> yeah ok I'll say that 8 could be a lot better lol
[0:43:09] <%jepupu> That Laguna combat music in 8 is dope though
[0:43:10] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Plague and his relentless positivity.
[0:43:10] <NickNackProductions> Y'all like enemy scaling?
[0:43:11] <tigerfang86> 8's like a fun piece of shit though
[0:43:11] <%StaceMcGate> my ears
[0:43:12] <Daxalog> Theres something about these low poly enemies in FF series and Parasite eve that are so pleasent looking
[0:43:13] <%Theastrica> ouch
[0:43:15] <tigerfang86> it's fun garbage
[0:43:17] <PhiZeroOne> it's super unintuitive and jank
[0:43:17] <%jepupu> Man with the Machine Gun
[0:43:18] <%lethallunacyx> 8 IS a piece of shit
[0:43:20] <%Alpha8087> Yeah thankfully Doom in this mode stops when the fight with the monster ends
[0:43:20] <veraverse> It's not RE6 , but it's okay i guess
[0:43:23] <mothdude> Armor is double broken.

[0:43:49] <PhiZeroOne> with 8, it's kinda hard to be at a place where the game is a fun challenge
[0:43:49] <%Alpha8087> Just screm Leviathan
[0:43:50] <+SilverDevilfish> ^dev

[0:44:57] <%RestiveGaming> 8 was good until the 3rd disk and Squalls character completely changed...and orphanage
[0:44:58] <%radda343> it super was
[0:45:00] <PhiZeroOne> ~~although I've skillfully avoided 13~~
[0:45:01] <Daxalog> Why is their an accusatory finger thats always hanging over your hhead?
[0:45:02] <%Wurmspawn> Oh for a minute I thought Pat was trying to grind for Ultima Weapon.

[0:45:29] <daisyyyy> CRTs had a built in anti-aliasing effect
[0:45:29] <%radda343> 8 is alright except for the draw system and the junction system and the equipment system and how limits work and basically everything about combat
[0:45:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Does Squal kick all the orphans in the face??
[0:45:30] <JunjiNeato> 13 is fine if you ignore everything but the music and the battle system
[0:45:32] <+PlagueOfGripes> too bad the old RE games didn't have The F I N G E R

[0:59:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> so Aeris fell in love with you because of Zack, meaning she didn't love you
[0:59:47] <%Im_A_CryBaby> that looks great
[0:59:51] <%radda343> I demand that the Barrett route in the remake be an actual date

[1:02:20] <SinnerBeta> how is that thing hopping faster than a running adult?
[1:02:20] <PirateMike_> This game looks like it's made from play dough
[1:02:21] <Plague_bagel> i like how he just goes "welp i betrayed you guys, cant do nothing about that. lets continue the journey"
[1:02:21] <veraverse> Xbox Sex will handle this scene better
[1:02:24] <joylent_blue> you were literally running a second ago
[1:02:29] <%StaceMcGate> Cait honeypotted you
[1:02:30] <Skatedeandre> I can tell it’s running like shit even on mobile which is super bad
[1:02:30] <FirearmsInstructor> @Razputin217 4k... STADIA

[1:03:14] <rytisone> Keanu Reeve
[1:03:18] <%BallerSwagBro9k> So what does he really look like
[1:03:19] <Skatedeandre> I hope when the meet cait in person they all sock him in the eye/throat
[1:03:19] <thedank> oooh spoiler...for a 20 year old game
[1:03:19] <+Ilpala> BIG PUSS WAS KICKED OUT OF THE PARTY
[1:03:29] <+metalsiren31> Shinra has PERFECT REAL TIME DRONE CONTROL tech but they waste their time with some weeb with a giant sword
[1:03:30] <tigerfang86> Big Puss is getting tired of megacapitalism
[1:03:31] <%StaceMcGate> Keep in mind all of this is said in a Scottish accent
[1:03:33] <%WhereIsWill> EVERYBODY BETRAY ME
[1:03:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> his appeal here is VERY poor
[1:03:39] <+machshop> who needs to get paid when the wildlife drops money
[1:03:41] <%skeletor42069> Keanu Reeves playing cait sith would be 11/10
[1:03:43] <lyzejag> I'M FED UP WITH THIS WORLD
[1:03:43] <Charuzu> ...they don't get paid after all this?
[1:03:43] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> You literally just betrayed us seconds ago.

[1:03:48] <deviljhojho_> GET SERIOUS
[1:03:49] <veraverse> Can't wait for Aerith and her journey throughout the ENTIRE game
[1:03:50] <joylent_blue> get real LUL
[1:03:54] <GarbageQueenEllie> Anyone else realize a lot of the best/most beloved rpg's are about the MC's identity being based off a lie?
[1:03:55] <Skatedeandre> What the duck
[1:03:55] <+BisoromiBear> Your way of life is weird. You don't even monetize your terror attacks.
[1:04:02] <Gregorhasjoined> Send BIG PUSS to the ranch!
[1:04:06] <FirearmsInstructor> Well that escalated quickly.
[1:04:07] <tigerfang86> HUGE blackmail
[1:04:08] <joylent_blue> oh yeah i forgot they KIDNAPPED MARLENE
[1:04:08] <Skatedeandre> This is horseshit now that I think about it

[1:04:31] <tigerfang86> k byeeeeeee
[1:04:33] <%StaceMcGate> I mean, you probably forgot Marlene existed at this point in the game

[1:05:13] <veraverse> I guess the real friends was the betraials we made along the way
[1:05:16] <FirearmsInstructor> what a weird wiggle-flower behind Vinent
[1:05:16] <%Im_A_CryBaby> all we can do now is interlock buttzippers
[1:05:17] <joylent_blue> did anyone tell Barret his daughter was kidnapped, or.............
[1:05:19] <deviljhojho_> rip

[1:06:02] <thedank> I can't wait for the tender loving Cloud does to Aerith once he gains the black materia
[1:06:03] <%StaceMcGate> Pat is angry his furry was replaced by a shrine maiden
[1:06:04] <JetpackMcQuack> I feel like I NEED to go Cloud :)
[1:06:06] <%Owkono> didn't you grind her upto get her final limit break?
[1:06:11] <%Im_A_CryBaby> bring Big Bo
[1:06:12] <%Jaxnos> can't wait for A4D to do sick twirls in the remake with her baton
[1:06:15] <joylent_blue> you can take it off from here, go to Arrange
[1:06:18] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh, the dumb dog thing
[1:06:21] <veraverse> Is this The Moment ™?
[1:06:22] <%Wrashis> @commanderclaw pretty sure paige said name her ass4dayz. and then he did
[1:06:25] <%baronblank> you can swap everything from red to her if you use arrange
[1:06:26] <%Wrashis> thats the big lore
[1:06:32] <@commanderclaw> Plague, those are fighting words
[1:06:37] <+PlagueOfGripes> Pat just use the exchange menu?
[1:06:47] <AliceAstro> girl who doesnt
[1:06:49] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Don't forget to unequip her equipment / materia before *SPOILER*
[1:06:50] <+PlagueOfGripes> you can select their names and just move the whole thing
[1:06:51] <+apocplz> pro menuing dmvSippySip
[1:06:57] <%Jaxnos> Pat is truly in the despair land now
[1:06:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> what is wrong with this man
[1:07:04] <mothdude> Whoa what! I played 50 hours of this and never knew about this menu.
[1:07:05] <lyzejag> WZIT WHAT
[1:07:07] <Lucifer753> knew about what?
[1:07:09] <MassConnect> just like monitor buttons
[1:07:12] <Daxalog> Give her Deathblow. For the jokes and laughs
[1:07:13] <%Wurmspawn> Pretty sure this wasn't in the original.
[1:07:15] <%StaceMcGate> Is doesn't matter, you're just gonna use attack over and over Kappa
[1:07:16] <%radda343> I've never seen this screen before in my life
[1:07:17] <thedank> >not having Vincent in your party early
[1:07:21] <Lucifer753> gotcha
[1:07:22] <lyzejag> God damn thanks
[1:07:24] <+captainpeaches> I also never used this menu until recently
[1:07:28] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat lol you're welcome for telling you about that :P RPGAyaya
[1:07:34] <JunjiNeato> same
[1:07:38] <Iggeh0> oh is this the part where Tifa gets the big dicking
[1:07:40] <%Jaxnos> so how many people didn't know about that menu in chat? i'm gonna go with at least 50
[1:07:45] <AliceAstro> she wants to feel sporty but still flirty
[1:07:46] <Charuzu> so best practice is to look at each menu before writing any of any of them off
[1:07:49] <Gregorhasjoined> EDK it
[1:07:51] <mothdude> Boning doesn't happen till endgame.
[1:07:52] <GarbageQueenEllie> Give all your best gear to Ass4Dayz. NOTHING could go wrong
[1:07:54] <thedank> I love the gold manlet armor
[1:08:06] <%Owkono> you can also select the armour and weapons or the entire character to swap it all
[1:08:06] <FirearmsInstructor> Doggo! Stay!
[1:08:09] <joylent_blue> Iggeh0 that's much later sadly
[1:08:16] <+captainpeaches> PHS stands for party hensei system, right?
[1:08:20] <%StaceMcGate> Did the Switch version fix the bugs? Like Magic Defense not working at all?
[1:08:21] <AliceAstro> wawawaahh
[1:08:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @captainpeaches Correct.
[1:08:31] <JunjiNeato> what else could it possibly stand for
[1:08:42] <Gregorhasjoined> Well she was supposed to mate with Red13, they're kinda the same species maybe???
[1:08:47] <veraverse> Pat Having Sex

[1:09:16] <Sokumotanaka> HOPE NOT
[1:09:17] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> If they're keeping the crossdressing, I think they'd keep that
[1:09:19] <FirearmsInstructor> @JunjiNeato RPGAyaya

[1:11:49] <Corvellia> Gold Saucer and Corel probably
[1:11:50] <Charuzu> @AbnormalVoid makes sense
[1:11:51] <KingGoblodyte> Aeris just REALLY love that bridge

[1:12:40] <%StaceMcGate> Tseng did you die or what?
[1:12:48] <uncledoodsauce> cloud punching aerith to death is definitely going to offend a bunch if abuse victims
[1:12:59] <+PlagueOfGripes> Tseng, the proto-cuck
[1:13:18] <%Owkono> ass4days
[1:13:23] <FirearmsInstructor> @PlagueOfGripes Is it weird that I can subvocalize your chat messages when I read them in *your* voice?
[1:13:26] <GarbageQueenEllie> Wait, does Clumbo seriously just beat the shit out of her? That's banaynays
[1:13:26] <savagedeviljayho> remember when CC made him have a crush on Aeirth even though in this game he slaps her?
[1:13:28] <veraverse> #Ass4Days
[1:13:30] <%Jaxnos> oh god, the slap is gonna be something in the remake. someone is storyboarding the backhand with full digits on Cloud's hand for part 3 right now.
[1:13:33] <+BisoromiBear> Tseng is a jobber
[1:13:45] <AliceAstro> fart on him
[1:13:49] <%StaceMcGate> @GarbageQueenEllie At the end of this, Cloud breaks down and beats the SHIT out of Aerith
[1:13:51] <%WhereIsWill> tseng says fuck this ill see yall in advent children!
[1:13:56] <mothdude> Tseng been trying to capture Aerith for years. Not very hard though I guess.
[1:13:57] <+captainpeaches> he also kidnapped her
[1:13:59] <Charuzu> did Tseng even do fucking anything in AC?
[1:14:08] <%WhereIsWill> nope LUL

[1:14:22] <tigerfang86> we're in the METAPHYSICAL ZONE

[1:14:24] <FirearmsInstructor> ESCHER NOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:14:24] <savagedeviljayho> Oh yeah Tseng slapping her will probably be cut same with Cloud beating the crap out of her
[1:14:28] <%Jaxnos> this is gonna be some weird shit
[1:14:29] <Mariakko> Is this a rough sketch on paper?
[1:14:40] <DAIROCKETTO> oh no it's the boss rush room from dmc3

[1:19:31] <joylent_blue> oh boy give that source to Aerith :)
[1:19:36] <+walnutcast> as someone who never played this originally and started with 10, is there blitzball in this or is this game pure and utter shit?
[1:19:40] <%HiroTSK5> Shame it's going to be like 5 years before we get a remix of this song
[1:19:50] <%radda343> this translation is soooo baaaaad
[1:19:51] <FirearmsInstructor> @HiroTSK5 ;-;
[1:20:00] <%StaceMcGate> @walnutcast this has the most minigames of any final fantasy. The one long minigame is related to chocobo breeding and racing
[1:20:07] <%Wurmspawn> There was one bit of dialogue that got cut later in the game where Cloud and Tifa walk out of the Chocobo bay on the Highwind. Tifa asked if Cloud thought anyone saw them. You can take your imagination from there.
[1:20:16] <TalisKanju> Oh yeah, I forgot that the game will end at leaving Midgar
[1:20:16] <JunjiNeato> blitzball low tier ff minigame
[1:20:17] <sonofthedeepsouth> >running from fights
[1:20:21] <+walnutcast> @StaceMcGate but are the mini games actually good?
[1:20:27] <Iggeh0> god i hate this dungeon
[1:20:28] <+walnutcast> @JunjiNeato how dare you
[1:20:37] <TalisKanju> The translation is awful
[1:20:40] <Sawada5hit> sucks we won't here cosmo cannon any time soon or costs de sol
[1:20:45] <%radda343> yeah he's only a regular coward, not a super coward
[1:20:47] <mothdude> I still can't believe that the entire party watched Cloud and Tifa do it. What perverts.
[1:20:48] <%StaceMcGate> @walnutcast so/so, only a minute long each at most. They aren't grating like Triple Triad or Chocobo Hot and Cold
[1:20:52] <%Owkono> isnt that one from the clockroom?
[1:20:55] <JunjiNeato> @walnutcast :---)
[1:20:59] <Gi_judd_617> That tifa scene only happens if her S link is high enough
[1:21:03] <%InugamiTheHound> pat's waifu Tifa is now a cat LOL
[1:21:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> do you think they'll record voice lines for them while they're in the Frog status?
[1:21:16] <joylent_blue> Chocobo Hot and Cold isn't grating its GREAT PunOko
[1:21:16] <TalisKanju> Pat's waifu is Tifa?
[1:21:21] <%StaceMcGate> Blitzball is the worst minigame of all time, you cannot lose with Jecht Shot
[1:21:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> the entire party masturbated as cloud put Tifa in the mating press
[1:21:27] <%Theastrica> one can only hope plague
[1:21:33] <MassConnect> I wanna say you come back to that screen later, but I dunno
[1:21:35] <+Woronov> @AngriestPat Pat whens Path of Exile new league startet :;D
[1:21:36] <JunjiNeato> triple triad is the best final fantasy game
[1:21:39] <%InugamiTheHound> yeah Pat likes big honkers or flower maiden
[1:21:47] <joylent_blue> yeah i think you get that later in the dungeon
[1:21:55] <Sawada5hit> implying Tifa didn't Amazon press cloud
[1:21:57] <joylent_blue> like from the clock room or something
[1:22:11] <%Owkono> pretty sure it is from clock
[1:22:13] <stolando_florida> The new path of exile league already started
[1:22:25] <+walnutcast> @StaceMcGate got it, thanks! but blitzball is the best if you don't just use tidus. leveling up Brotha, Keepa, etc is really enjoyalbe
[1:22:28] <Charuzu> yeah like last weak
[1:22:39] <%SolidusRex> Who else is hyped for Ruby Weapon in FFXIV?
[1:22:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @AngriestPat At what time Paige strem?
[1:22:51] <sonofthedeepsouth> @Sawada5hit Why not both?
[1:22:55] <%WhereIsWill> it really is
[1:23:02] <+Woronov> yes it is but u just pick a template some1 else thought about
[1:23:03] <%BestTeaMaker> you're not supposed to minmax your first playthrough tbh
[1:23:06] <%DedlokPM> It really REALLY is
[1:23:07] <FirearmsInstructor> What's horrifying??
[1:23:10] <%StaceMcGate> @walnutcast I just found it very easy to exploit. Enemies won't pursue you if you're right on their goal, you can run out the clock easily, and just got tedious after awhile
[1:23:12] <%BestTeaMaker> the terrifying minmaxing comes after the first playthrough
[1:23:14] <Dreigun> it is pretty overwhelming for new players
[1:23:14] <Charuzu> does the sphere grid do that to you to?
[1:23:16] <canisdyluna> @pat is the music supposed to sound like that, it slows down, or is it me?
[1:23:23] <sonofthedeepsouth> USE THE F-ING GUIDE
[1:23:23] <%BestTeaMaker> those people are assholes tbh :V
[1:23:23] <%WhereIsWill> my friends wanted me to play it and i had a damn panic attack looking at the tree
[1:23:24] <Gi_judd_617> Dont forget that ribbon
[1:23:27] <%lordsdb> they should honestly hide most of that skill tree, you shouldn't be seeing most of it anyway
[1:23:29] <%AbnormalVoid> probably by chumps
[1:23:32] <%enickma11> You super don't have to, it's not that bad
[1:23:43] <joylent_blue> canisdyluna you might have that one twitch bug, try refreshing
[1:23:45] <%Wurmspawn> Pat not min-max? How long have you people been watching this guy?!
[1:23:46] <MassConnect> can you min-max sex?
[1:23:54] <availablethor> Oh this shitty area.
[1:23:57] <AutechreTwinAphex> hey pat are you going to play that 'tuh ken' fighting game?
[1:23:57] <%StaceMcGate> I think limit breaks ruined the difficulty of Final Fantasy games, just burst damage everything to death
[1:23:58] <sonofthedeepsouth> EARLY EJACULATION
[1:24:00] <mothdude> You shouldn't use Cait Sith, not because he is bad gameplay-wise, but because he's a big traitor.
[1:24:00] <canisdyluna> thx
[1:24:01] <+walnutcast> @StaceMcGate i agree 100%, that's why i try to avoid using those sorts of exploits on my playthroughs these days. it's like when i play an NBA 2K game, there's cheesy strategies but some people like to reenact realistic gameplay instead!
[1:24:06] <stolando_florida> IMO it's worth seeing how far you can get on your own knowledge, but picking any guide that looks fun isn't a bad option too. There's tons of viable builds so it's hard to say which is better than another.
[1:24:07] <rytisone> Lucky Clumbo
[1:24:08] <Charuzu> yay. Luck.
[1:24:14] <%Owkono> just morph the tankceratops with yuffie for unlimited attack boosts
[1:24:14] <availablethor> Took me so long to find the way to some of these chests even with a guide.
[1:24:19] <%enickma11> Like the game is complex but acting like you'll ruin it without a college degree is just people overblowing how hard it is
[1:24:21] <%Theastrica> i gotta go to christmas party, have fun everyone
[1:24:26] <%jepupu> Funnily enough Path of Exile is something Woolie would probably be more comfortable with since he probably wouldn't care about the minmaxing part
[1:24:28] <%StaceMcGate> @Theastrica bye
[1:24:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> "Oh look, Clumbo! These bracers add +5 to unarmed damage!"-Aerith
[1:24:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GOTTA GO FAST
[1:24:50] <TalisKanju> SONIC.
[1:24:51] <AutechreTwinAphex> not playing the Remako Mod version eh?
[1:24:54] <sonofthedeepsouth> LUL
[1:24:54] <joylent_blue> lmao
[1:24:59] <%Wrashis> best part is no encounters because sometimes encounters just need to go
[1:25:02] <availablethor> @jepupu PoE is only fun on Hardcore tho
[1:25:05] <mothdude> We Indiana Jones now.
[1:25:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> fast forward more, dummy
[1:25:09] <red_blaster> I hope this is in the remake
[1:25:15] <%Garthunox> Pat did you see Nemesis in the new RE2 demo?
[1:25:16] <%badchoice5> I keep forgetting I'm watching live and not VOD
[1:25:17] <artoflec> why does this exist, where do the rocks come from
[1:25:22] <%Garthunox> or hear I should say

[1:27:20] <%Soulbishop> So boring fact for chat.
[1:27:22] <sonofthedeepsouth> rejected
[1:27:24] <MassConnect> chat is a well of souls filled with ancient knowledge

[1:27:38] <joylent_blue> TalisKanju i don't see him playing CC or DoC unfortunately
[1:27:38] <laserbeaming> is Aerith not dead yet? She should hurry up
[1:27:38] <%Bailey__gaming> isnt THE INCIDENT soon?

[1:27:45] <%Garthunox> this music still freaks me out
[1:27:47] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Bailey__gaming VERY
[1:27:48] <%Soulbishop> Except 7
[1:27:49] <%Rain_Mage> Seph's been playing Assassin's Creed
[1:27:51] <+apocplz> sephiroth HahaSweat
[1:27:51] <+FalseEyeD> Sephy-chaaaan.
[1:27:54] <availablethor> This music is edge incarnate.
[1:27:55] <MassConnect> Sephiroth getting fed as fuck
[1:27:56] <AliceAstro> baddu boye
[1:27:57] <%StaceMcGate> Your sword is silly Sephiroth
[1:27:58] <%Bailey__gaming> Sephy! <3
[1:28:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PRAISE THE SEPH
[1:28:10] <Charuzu> dominate the temple
[1:28:10] <+PlagueOfGripes> Can I point out how Aeris' plan is the one that works, and the game is literally won right after she takes matters into her own hands? Cloud and the gang do basically nothing
[1:28:12] <%Garthunox> I used to RP sephiroth like 12 years ago
[1:28:14] <%InugamiTheHound> geostigma!!
[1:28:16] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Dat's right Seph. Assert dat dominance
[1:28:19] <joylent_blue> T pose to speak with the planet
[1:28:19] <Dementedpenguin> WutFace
[1:28:19] <bazz_tv> i can't see tifa without calling her Beefaroni
[1:28:27] <zamzoph> MMMMM. MEEE
[1:28:29] <+captainpeaches> the outside looks like a Mayan temple, and the inside is Egyptian
[1:28:29] <%CalderGaming> pLANETKIN
[1:28:32] <sonofthedeepsouth> BTFO
[1:28:37] <+apocplz> @bazz_tv barbHmm
[1:28:45] <%StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes They had to remove the barrier that prevented her plan from happening.
[1:28:45] <%Bailey__gaming> Get fucked shinra goons
[1:28:46] <availablethor> @PlagueOfGripes That's why she has to die. She's too OP nerf.
[1:28:48] <lyzejag> Yeah how ?
[1:28:49] <Charuzu> @captainpeaches seems legit
[1:28:52] <%Rain_Mage> Cause he strong
[1:28:54] <zamzoph> weird since Tseng never really does anything
[1:28:54] <joylent_blue> true, he only got murked a little bit
[1:28:55] <bazz_tv> oney and Ding Dong ruined my perception of this game
[1:29:00] <Desertfishing> he yell
[1:29:03] <sonofthedeepsouth> woob woob woob
[1:29:04] <%Rain_Mage> Tseng Strongest there is
[1:29:06] <%spiritofmojave> Even after that clear death flag too, Tseng stronk
[1:29:08] <bazz_tv> "improved"
[1:29:11] <pectusumbra> and just caught up with the league stream.
[1:29:11] <Gi_judd_617> I think him being alive in AC is a retcon
[1:29:12] <%Owkono> he is as strong as baby tifa
[1:29:13] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Then Micheal Jackson another part of me plays
[1:29:18] <%jayjayonfire> Gotta feed the baby!
[1:29:19] <Tankjutsu> hutchClem
[1:29:22] <%InugamiTheHound> Tseng and Elena survive their fight against Yazoo and kadji and Loz in AC movie as well
[1:29:25] <%StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes Plus her plan might of also eradicated all human life if the planet deemed humans a threat
[1:29:28] <%Rain_Mage> It's a translation issue that implies that he dies.
[1:29:28] <rytisone> just use phoenix down - Tseng
[1:29:31] <+FalseEyeD> There is a major lack of Elena in the Remake promotional material
[1:29:31] <%Soulbishop> Whats even more impressive is Seph swears to be so in touch but he can't tell if his target died and gave their life over to the energy stream. . .
[1:29:36] <%Soulbishop> Trash ass Seph
[1:29:38] <mothdude> Sephiroth duplicating himself there is so sinister and creepy before you know what's going on.
[1:29:41] <+apocplz> sometimes i forget there's all that movie lore and shit i never watched
[1:29:42] <sonofthedeepsouth> claw him
[1:29:43] <+PlagueOfGripes> Would the barrier have even gone up if Cloud didn't fuck things up after this?
[1:29:47] <joylent_blue> they really make it seem like Tseng and Elena die in Advent Children
[1:29:48] <sonofthedeepsouth> CLAW HIM ELMO
[1:29:50] <%CalderGaming> @PlagueOfGripes there's something to be said for getting her from midgar to here in one piece
[1:29:50] <%Piemen99> YEYEYEYE
[1:29:54] <stolando_florida> I can't believe Pat died
[1:29:57] <%cvp5127> ?
[1:29:57] <Dementedpenguin> o-O
[1:29:57] <joylent_blue> just so the surprise of them saving Rufus hits harder i guess
[1:30:01] <%InugamiTheHound> what?
[1:30:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @AngriestPat At wat time Paige stream?
[1:30:02] <availablethor> How does he duplicate himself again? I that power established?
[1:30:04] <Charuzu> "I can feel blod in my pants."
[1:30:05] <Desertfishing> blood in the sex parts

[1:30:12] <+apocplz> barbGalsia
[1:30:14] <MillaMoks> "I can feel blood in my pants" is probably not a great thing to have a clean clip of XD
[1:30:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmo used his limit break
[1:30:22] <%StaceMcGate> @PlagueOfGripes At this point, Sephiroth is in the lifestream so he would of still been a barrier. If not Cloud delivering the materia, he would of made more Jenova Clones to get the materia

[1:31:51] <%thewildzubat> why do the rocks just stop?
[1:31:53] <joylent_blue> yeah the wall of fuckery is soon

[1:54:14] <%StaceMcGate> The Ancients were used as slaves by the Egyptians apparently
[1:54:19] <Arek_1> @Torei_san NotLikeThis
[1:54:23] <lotharrio> Sephiroth is really... OLD MAN WITHERS!
[1:54:28] <+Adalore> And this is where my ff7 run effectively ended.
[1:54:30] <OlavOlavsson> that's supposed to mean something?
[1:54:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I always hold in sneezes because I was told it would make my head explode
[1:54:44] <%Bailey__gaming> big EGYPT
[1:54:46] <%Soulbishop> Deep down we all know that Pat would let Seph kill everyone if it meant he didn't have to have awkward conversations in the uber.
[1:54:47] <zamzoph> Meteor monkaS
[1:54:48] <%AbnormalVoid> "I said TREASUREHOUSE OF KNOWLEDGE"
[1:54:48] <%radda343> nobody understands because the translation is bad
[1:54:51] <%Alpha8087> I like how Sephiroth has amazing yeet powers
[1:54:59] <+Adalore> gosh why did the Egyptians have to invent meteor.
[1:54:59] <%Wurmspawn> He's gonna summon LAVOS!
[1:55:00] <olaksi> What should be the ancient aesthetic be? well egyptians were ancient right?
[1:55:03] <%CalderGaming> planetkin intensifies
[1:55:07] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie would let Sephiroth kill the planet if it meant he got more arms and bar
[1:55:08] <%jepupu> Man he's pretty nuts
[1:55:08] <%CalderGaming> is he sucking his thumb
[1:55:11] <mothdude> There are like four Sephiroths in this room.
[1:55:14] <%Quigsies> m-muther

[1:55:35] <joylent_blue> jeez Sephiroth watch where you swing that thing
[1:55:35] <+Torei_san> Sure sounds like wobbling a metal sheet
[1:55:41] <%CalderGaming> yep
[1:55:43] <%quackisalive> Why does Cloud suck his party into his ass? The remake better have this feature.
[1:55:46] <%StaceMcGate> @Bailey__gaming two boss battles and then big oof time
[1:55:54] <JetpackMcQuack> that would be bad huh

[1:56:26] <%Bailey__gaming> his number will go UP
[1:56:30] <MassConnect> the ultimate destructive magic: moba game
[1:56:32] <%Wurmspawn> Except that if the Meteor DESTROYS the planet, there will be no more injury for the energy to go into.
[1:56:39] <+Adalore> It'll happen multiple times in fact during the final boss fight.
[1:56:45] <%CalderGaming> is cloud laughing or shivering
[1:56:46] <joylent_blue> Cloud's super stable you guys
[1:56:47] <CSeriesJTYPE> hahahehehoho
[1:56:47] <%Shady_Squid> This is REALLY dumb.
[1:56:50] <%AbnormalVoid> Oh no, Sephiroth gave Cloud Parkinsons
[1:56:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> use my sweet bappos to bring you back to your senses
[1:56:54] <%CalderGaming> ok that answers that
[1:56:57] <%StaceMcGate> Meteor won't destroy the planet, just gravelly wound it... it's all very scientific
[1:56:57] <savagedeviljayho> imagine this in remake
[1:56:58] <%WhereIsWill> this gonna be great in the remake LUL
[1:57:01] <zamzoph> monkaS 4Head
[1:57:01] <TalisKanju> Clumbo & Knuckles
[1:57:03] <filialpails> this story is so dumb, no one would ever cause irreversible harm to the planet just make their own number go up... right?
[1:57:07] <%radda343> I predict this scene will be dumber than the FFX laugh scene in the remake
[1:57:14] <%jepupu> That's some Jacob's Ladder shit there
[1:57:16] <%CalderGaming> @filialpails KAppa

[1:57:47] <olaksi> Just ignore the mental problems
[1:57:48] <%StaceMcGate> FFX laugh scene was supposed to be bad, they were faking their laughs
[1:57:50] <zamzoph> Tifa's letting him getting away with EVERYTHING
[1:57:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> @filialpails ....yeah sure, it would neeeever happen in real life.
[1:58:10] <m0bman> That laugh scene was not supposed to be bad lol
[1:58:16] <%logoth_> DRAGON!
[1:58:17] <FalseEyeD> *SNIFF*
[1:58:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> It's a generic dragonnnnnn
[1:58:17] <%spiritofmojave> DWAGON
[1:58:18] <+apocplz> barbBanger
[1:58:19] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DRAGUN
[1:58:19] <%Soulbishop> We will miss the jank of cloud going crazy scenes in the remake.
[1:58:19] <%StaceMcGate> the most generic boss in the game
[1:58:19] <%ClaudeMcGarren> SICK DARGON
[1:58:19] <JetpackMcQuack> is smaug ?
[1:58:20] <%jepupu> In the remake Cloud's totally gonna be all "Unh ouch hot boy getting a headache please comfort me"
[1:58:25] <%Bailey__gaming> MFW Ultima does more dmg than Metor inn final boss fight
[1:58:27] <%Alpha8087> That was not red, fake game
[1:58:28] <+PlagueOfGripes> I forgot this boss even happened
[1:58:30] <%Typhaeon> Kind of a fat dragon
[1:58:31] <%Alpha8087> red rather
[1:58:35] <%radda343> a green one of these is in the northern crater as a jobber
[1:58:39] <%Bailey__gaming> that's one CHONKY dargon
[1:58:39] <%Soulbishop> It will be all well-acted and expressful
[1:58:45] <Arek_1> Did Pat unequip Aerith's stuff before this fight?
[1:58:47] <Fujiwara_92> should ass4dayz be dead?... I dunno this game...
[1:58:49] <%Saltmeisterr> hey gamers
[1:58:51] <Charuzu> @m0bman I think the VA for Tidus has gone on record saying that's how he was directed
[1:58:51] <joylent_blue> Tidus's VA has said that scene was supposed to be silly and dumb
[1:58:56] <%CalderGaming> @PlagueOfGripes that seems to happen for a lot of people with a lot of bosses in this game
[1:58:57] <Corvellia> Pretty sure it gives you her stuff back @Arek_1
[1:59:03] <m0bman> Who wouldnt say that
[1:59:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> A dragon! Thats the monster Plague likes the most! Right? Kappa
[1:59:13] <%Bailey__gaming> as a kid i always thought that sound effect was dogs barking
[1:59:14] <Arek_1> Oh, never mind. Not this fight.
[1:59:27] <%WhereIsWill> Safi Jiva makes a guest appearance!
[1:59:37] <joylent_blue> Corvellia it totally doesn't and its crazy that it doesn't

[1:59:52] <Corvellia> Really? I played through it recently and I could have sworn I at least got the materia back
[1:59:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THE CUM CANNOT BE DEFEATED
[1:59:57] <Arek_1> @Corvellia Maybe materia but not any valuable weapons or armor equipped.
[2:00:00] <+Torei_san> Can you defend a cumhazzard with a wet floor sign?
[2:00:04] <sonofthedeepsouth> BTFO
[2:00:06] <%radda343> sephiroth loves leaving behind summons
[2:00:07] <TalisKanju> They still didn't fix not getting back her stuff?
[2:00:14] <Corvellia> The weapon is worthless anyways, but yeah the armor should be unequipped just in case
[2:00:15] <%StaceMcGate> this is your favorite bahumut summon in the game? @AngriestPat
[2:00:15] <%Shady_Squid> Man. everyone always mentions the fake laugh thing from FFX but no one ever talks about how good the scene is where TIdus learns about the summoners
[2:00:15] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> bahamut is in the house
[2:00:16] <%Bailey__gaming> yeah my Boi!
[2:00:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BAHAMUT ALI PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp

[2:00:30] <%WhereIsWill> bahamut ali is correct LUL
[2:00:35] <mothdude> Manipulate is good for Blue magic, but not much else.

[2:00:47] <Arek_1> @Corvellia You can sell Aerith's weapon. LUL

[2:00:57] <+apocplz> shake it? barbLUL

[2:01:31] <Gi_judd_617> They look so weird with mouths
[2:01:33] <+PlagueOfGripes> Aeris' White Materia used to be her church!
[2:01:39] <sonofthedeepsouth> BLACK materia
[2:01:39] <olaksi> honey i shrunk the animes
[2:01:48] <Fujiwara_92> shrink porn, i see
[2:01:52] <%StaceMcGate> The Ancients designed this place to hold the Materia instead of just destroying it all together?
[2:01:56] <mothdude> Sephiroth has so many black cloak guys.
[2:01:57] <joylent_blue> the idea of selling Aerith's weapons makes me think of the "child's shoes for sale (never worn)" thing LUL
[2:02:04] <rytisone> just leave it, sephiroth cant do shit then
[2:02:05] <%jepupu> ... Did Sephiroth have a single helper?
[2:02:05] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat no
[2:02:05] <%SolidusRex> Flunkies is the most 90s sounding word in the world
[2:02:05] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> And then this part happens

[2:02:33] <%Bailey__gaming> i forgot that this game had a Cell Phone
[2:02:33] <%JohnAtDawn> How the fuck does this actually work? Materia is solid mako, so why is it okay for Black to have all these empty spaces in it and still work?Also, those torches are clearly wood, so the whoel temple can't just be mako.
[2:02:34] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat That was the PHS / in game phone ringing, not your real phone. LUL
[2:02:34] <%wjones0415> no, demon wall is coming
[2:02:35] <TalisKanju> The Ancients did not have the foresight to think of robots or slaves, or people perfectly willing to be sacrificed
[2:02:38] <%CalderGaming> wow that timing

[2:03:10] <Arek_1> @StaceMcGate Destroying materia would have their boundless knowledge be lost forever.
[2:03:11] <%Soulbishop> booze break you say?

[2:03:12] <babypie1988> Ran outta tp
[2:03:13] <%thewildzubat> i still love this track, it fucking slaps
[2:03:13] <%TungstenViper> "Hi Clumbo, this is Big Boss. infiltrate Tifa and destroy her clit, over."
[2:03:25] <%Alpha8087> @FirearmsInstructor Thats fair lol
[2:03:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @TungstenViper jezus...
[2:03:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @TungstenViper LUL LUL LUL
[2:03:40] <%StaceMcGate> @Arek_1 boundless knowledge of a spell whose only purpose is to destroy all life on the planet?
[2:03:41] <sonofthedeepsouth> "Now do her doggystyle cloud!"
[2:04:00] <%Typhaeon> Man, FF7 makes some people go IN
[2:04:10] <Arek_1> @StaceMcGate Ye.
[2:04:11] <mothdude> So the reason there are multiple Sephiroths running around is because each one is a person with Jenova clones shapeshifted into Sephiroth. All those people with black cloaks and number tatoos are the Sephiroth Clones pre-transformation.
[2:04:12] <%cvp5127> eww
[2:04:14] <joylent_blue> gross
[2:04:16] <%walternatorz> tseng is your pookie bear?
[2:04:18] <+AtisutoCurry> aww
[2:04:20] <TalisKanju> The Ancients knew that someone would screw the world up so much that they need to reset it
[2:04:22] <AliceAstro> tifa would top the shit out of dumb himbo cloud
[2:04:22] <%ClaudeMcGarren> your what lol ?1

[2:04:28] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I hate this part of the story
[2:04:42] <%SilverDevilfish> But thou must
[2:04:59] <%StaceMcGate> Ok real question: are cait sith's sentient or just manually operated? @AngriestPat
[2:05:06] <%Alpha8087> Demon Wall here to get you to subscribe to Bell
[2:05:17] <TalisKanju> The Temple/Black Materia thing is something I never liked about this game
[2:05:20] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Question of the last two decades
[2:05:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @StaceMcGate Its super inconsistent
[2:05:23] <%Bailey__gaming> I wonder why he's doing that?
[2:05:25] <Corvellia> I'm fairly certain they're manually operated.
[2:05:30] <%Garthunox> no john
[2:05:30] <Charuzu> I always thought Cait Sith was like mentally controlled or something like that
[2:05:31] <%Bailey__gaming> hmmm
[2:05:33] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> Because the answer is both apparently
[2:05:33] <%logoth_> DRAGON! HadooOOken
[2:05:39] <%Garthunox> you are the demons

[2:13:01] <+Ilpala> THERE IS LITERALLY MORE OF YOU
[2:13:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I hope they actually change this part in the remake. Rewrite it so that the whole segment is better
[2:13:04] <%StaceMcGate> Are you a robot or a drone?!!
[2:13:04] <%Shady_Squid> And big puss returned to his home on the moon.
[2:13:06] <sonofthedeepsouth> FORGETS
[2:13:06] <GarbageQueenEllie> They should've played this up for laughs. Using an RC cat to save the planet
[2:13:10] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> There is literally a guy controlling you
[2:13:10] <joylent_blue> you're literally a dude in an office
[2:13:13] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I hate when anime does stuff like this

[2:13:35] <%wjones0415> I remember originally this scene messed me up!
[2:13:36] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> I'd love for this sacrifice scene to be removed from the remake unless they confirm that each robot has a personality
[2:13:36] <red_blaster> I think this is here to make it worse when Aeris actually dies for real
[2:13:37] <+BisoromiBear> Reeve is ERPing as a hero
[2:13:38] <%Garthunox> RIP big puss
[2:13:39] <Corvellia> TIME FOR A REAL GAMER MOMENT
[2:13:39] <%SolidusRex> It's implied that Cait Sith has an actual AI, that Reeves just hijacks when he needs to sometimes or some shit
[2:13:39] <%logoth_> This is what Im here for!
[2:13:39] <%GarbageNirvana> NO BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT
[2:13:40] <MassConnect> and what's more they're not really your friends

[2:13:49] <Basch71> Cloud about to be the biggest gamer
[2:13:49] <%SilverDevilfish> It's like if the Mark 2 went down the MGS4 microwave hall on it's own and it tried to make us care
[2:13:52] <Arek_1> The scene that most people forget.
[2:13:52] <mothdude> Caith Sith's "death" is peak comedy.
[2:13:52] <%Quigsies> Oh shit here it comes
[2:13:52] <@CoalSavoie> I feel like it has to be SOMEWHAT autonomous and Reeve hijacks it. Otherwise he's controlling it 24/7 which makes no sense either
[2:13:53] <+Ilpala> ELI NO
[2:13:53] <HyperBomb21> Time for waifu beating :D
[2:13:53] <%jayjayonfire> Gee, sure is a shame we'll never see B...oh hey Big Puss #2

[2:28:08] <%Alpha8087> But thats the best part
[2:28:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> QUALITY CONTENT
[2:28:13] <%StaceMcGate> A Xenogears remake without characters sitting in chairs explaining the plot? Heresy
[2:28:13] <+RealThiele> the 10000
[2:28:13] <olaksi> Xenogears remake won't happen before some intense 90s nostalgia period
[2:28:15] <cascadepersona> 2020: Where there's a shit ton of games coming out, and then new consoles. Gonna be in the hole LUL

[2:31:39] <lowpolyguys> This is also where you get the Sector 7 key. Also, grab Kujata, you Captain Planet villain.
[2:31:54] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @StrawberryPantsu
[2:31:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat There's other goodies you can get besides the harp, too. Good stuff

[2:34:22] <%InugamiTheHound> you...did...it
[2:34:23] <Corvellia> No that's disc 2
[2:34:23] <FalseEyeD> Is this a Stranding game?
[2:34:36] <joylent_blue> you have to talk to the guy at the gate before you can dig up the key
[2:34:36] <%Alpha8087> Grakata?
[2:34:40] <+PlagueOfGripes> Lunar SMARCH!? DAMMIT
[2:34:40] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Kujata is in the forest
[2:34:42] <+Fox_Rezard> they get good treasurefor you, keep all the great treasure for themselves, maybe also the mediocre treasure.
[2:34:42] <shiny_prinny> you get that in the forest i think
[2:34:43] <olaksi> Summon is in the forest
[2:34:45] <smallboops> pat this is totally a strand game, look at all this walking
[2:34:48] <xeros720> connect the past with the future with these "Strand" bombs
[2:34:53] <%Soulbishop> That summon is in the forrest
[2:35:00] <FalseEyeD> DS Amelie talking segment = Xenogears Disc 2
[2:35:02] <%KaironFortressKnight> the goodest
[2:35:04] <ape_hawk> that youll never use
[2:35:05] <+Fox_Rezard> thats pretty good treasure
[2:35:06] <joylent_blue> time to never use it
[2:35:07] <shiny_prinny> that's pretty fuckin good
[2:35:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> but Mop though
[2:35:08] <rytisone> now never use it
[2:35:10] <Iggeh0> good treasure that is never gonna be used
[2:35:14] <%spiritofmojave> Time to keep it gathering dust
[2:35:15] <%InugamiTheHound> pat will never use it
[2:35:17] <Fujiwara_92> time to not use
[2:35:17] <Corvellia> Never use it until you can get a full stack of them with w-item
[2:35:23] <+Fox_Rezard> damn.... "never use?"
[2:35:29] <%Alpha8087> It will look nice on Clumbo's shelves
[2:35:34] <%Ipsenscastle> Famous strand games include Knuckles Chaotix, Noby Noby Boy and Spider-man 2
[2:35:35] <joylent_blue> oh that's true just w-item it
[2:35:37] <Aydarkzero> is Aeris dead yet?
[2:35:38] <eleveneighteen> have we done any chocobo inbreeding yet?
[2:35:38] <olaksi> Why the hell do I remember exactly where kujata is in this game I played over 10 years ago
[2:35:40] <+Valentttine> I hear using consumables kills aeris
[2:35:41] <+RealThiele> i always founf it easier to sell the mega recovery items to get rid of the too good to use mentality
[2:35:50] <%umbypokochan> but you have to save all elixirs for the end so you can use them on Magic Pots to get lots of AP... it's the only way to play! :P
[2:35:51] <+PlagueOfGripes> if Remake doesn't have the W-Item glitch, OH MAN.
[2:35:53] <+Valentttine> my uncle in nintendo told me
[2:35:58] <%StaceMcGate> left
[2:36:01] <Corvellia> If remake doesn't have the w-item glitch I'm refunding
[2:36:04] <%SlashHabit> Sup Pat

[2:37:13] <+RealThiele> sploosh
[2:37:14] <+Valentttine> I missed earlier streams did you get Vincent?
[2:37:25] <%InugamiTheHound> @Valentttine he has everyone
[2:37:30] <joylent_blue> Valentttine he named him Dr. Acula
[2:37:37] <MassConnect> hope that worked
[2:37:43] <+Valentttine> Nice
[2:37:46] <+RealThiele> Arikardo
[2:37:49] <+StrawberryPantsu> I'm so glad all the dumb enemies are still in the remake
[2:37:54] <smallboops> god how are they gonna do vins transforms when theyre so... infringy
[2:37:55] <%KaironFortressKnight> Vincent is awesome. but fuck his limit breaks
[2:38:01] <%InugamiTheHound> Tifa is mad wet now thanks to the "water ring"
[2:38:05] <shiny_prinny> i wonder how blind/darkness status will work in remake
[2:38:06] <+RealThiele> that model
[2:38:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> What is that thing
[2:38:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Too bad we wont see Areith's death in remake for like 5 years
[2:38:12] <%StaceMcGate> Proto Quina
[2:38:15] <%jepupu> Cute
[2:38:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> mini Tifa is still good
[2:38:22] <%olaksi> This is probably a fetish
[2:38:22] <joylent_blue> Vincent and his DT limit break
[2:38:24] <King_thunder365> Tiny Tifa...No wait, Tiny Tina!
[2:38:25] <+Fox_Rezard> So what version of this? this battle speed is something else
[2:38:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MIMI TIFA Kappa Kappa Kappa
[2:38:29] <%AbnormalVoid> Those things will eat you after shrinking you
[2:38:29] <%Owkono> VORE
[2:38:29] <FirearmsInstructor> @PlagueOfGripes Now she's tight without the froglegs... RPGAyaya
[2:38:30] <Arek_1> Tiny Tifa. Kreygasm
[2:38:33] <rytisone> sell her as an action figure
[2:38:35] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> The final zone in Shadowbringers reminded me a lot of this area, but I'm kinda disappointed that Amarot didn't match the ancient city here
[2:38:42] <+Fox_Rezard> incming more Ominous Music ever
[2:38:42] <+Valentttine> @xerosigmaprime in 5 years there will be people playing who dont know its coming too, its gonna be beautiful
[2:38:44] <xeros720> switch version? it's the current one being sold on consoles at least
[2:38:48] <+Fox_Rezard> most^
[2:38:54] <%StaceMcGate> Would you torture a tiny Hitler you keep in your pocket?
[2:38:57] <%Alpha8087> Can 13 learn Cosmo Memory yet?
[2:39:02] <%supersugoisenpai1> Has anyone ever gotten Aerith's final limit break?
[2:39:02] <%Alpha8087> I saw it in your inventory
[2:39:05] <+Fox_Rezard> hate/REALLY love this track
[2:39:05] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> This track is the ONE track I can't wait to hear remade
[2:39:06] <%AbnormalVoid> Kreygasm
[2:39:06] <+PlagueOfGripes> this track is a banger
[2:39:07] <GarbageQueenEllie> Awww sheeet this is fire
[2:39:09] <%InugamiTheHound> I love this track so much
[2:39:10] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @StrawberryPantsu Maybe.. but its Nomura, probs not
[2:39:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @StaceMcGate .... what???
[2:39:10] <joylent_blue> its great
[2:39:10] <%XzileGaming> can you hear the cry of the planet
[2:39:12] <%StaceMcGate> @Alpha8087 you need to learn all limits before you can learn lvl 4
[2:39:13] <shiny_prinny> is there a bad track in this whole game?
[2:39:15] <mothdude> Oh the music builds such a great sense of forboding.
[2:39:15] <%spiritofmojave> this remix gonna be killer Kreygasm
[2:39:21] <+PlagueOfGripes> really makes you feel like you're entering some fucked up old city
[2:39:25] <%templar010> You can hear the cry of the planet
[2:39:29] <Arek_1> @StaceMcGate Oney is great.
[2:39:31] <%vectorless_peon> this trak inspires origenal Mass Effect SO HARD
[2:39:32] <%Alpha8087> @StaceMcGate Ah gotcha! Thought he did already.
[2:39:33] <King_thunder365> "Ah shit, he we go again."
[2:39:33] <+ckangaroo15k> This location is so weird. Like a drained aquarium or something.
[2:39:45] <+RealThiele> Uematsu is like john williams in that he just created soooo much good music
[2:39:54] <%Bailey__gaming> I mean we arnt getting to this point in the game with the 1st bit of Remake
[2:39:58] <FirearmsInstructor> @ckangaroo15k holy shit you're right.... never thought of it that way, but yeah you're super right
[2:40:00] <%StaceMcGate> @Alpha8087 You need to kill a certain # of enemies and use limits a number of time to advance
[2:40:05] <+Fox_Rezard> Does it ever feel like this place SHOULD have had random encounters?
[2:40:15] <+unfoldingchoas> Words of the Ancients is Pat talking
[2:40:19] <King_thunder365> here, not he
[2:40:21] <+RealThiele> gottem
[2:40:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> S owait, was this where Boomers usedto live?
[2:40:49] <%InugamiTheHound> fucking nothing!
[2:40:49] <+RealThiele> they cant afford it so they moved out
[2:40:50] <+ckangaroo15k> I only played FF7 for the first time last Summer and this place was super impactful.
[2:40:54] <%supersugoisenpai1> Ancient tech projector
[2:40:57] <chaospudding> I miss prerendered backgrounds
[2:40:59] <King_thunder365> Man, it'd be nuts if 27 more people were here so the viewer count would be 777
[2:41:05] <%Owkono> look at this nothing right here

[2:41:25] <%kujofire990> OCEAN MAN
[2:41:26] <+Mr_Pylon> except when they built ziggaruts?
[2:41:31] <%AbnormalVoid> The only thing that's weird is "why do nomads have a city?"
[2:41:33] <%ChaosAethr> thanks to jenova that all ending
[2:41:38] <rytisone> this damn lake

[2:41:49] <%ChaosAethr> ened

[2:41:55] <FirearmsInstructor> @King_thunder365 KappaRoss
[2:41:56] <+Forente> oh is this the part where the thing happens
[2:41:58] <%StaceMcGate> COMET
[2:42:02] <Corvellia> @StrawberryPantsu Never

[2:42:05] <+Fox_Rezard> Comet, anoher one nobody used....
[2:42:07] <%supersugoisenpai1> I sure hope nothing bad happens here
[2:42:09] <%templar010> Perish
[2:42:09] <joylent_blue> this is where that sick fight scene happens in Advent Children
[2:42:11] <mothdude> They have a city because a bunch of Ancients settled down to cultivate the land after Jenova crashed into the planet and messed the land up.
[2:42:12] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @PlagueOfGripes Aerith* hehehe
[2:42:13] <%radda343> I never understood that fish hologram, did the ancients just fuckin like looking at fish
[2:42:13] <Zebroneath> poor Nemo
[2:42:13] <%CalderGaming> Comet, TOTALLY UNLIKE METEOR
[2:42:20] <King_thunder365> Remember how the European boxart just SPOILS this fucking scene by showing her dead in one of the screenshots on the back?
[2:42:24] <joylent_blue> vincent has to save cloud's ass
[2:42:32] <+metalsiren31> I remember when I was a kid and I found that and I was like "oh cool I guess I found meteor just now, comet's like the same thing"
[2:42:39] <ammobasket> clean your bathroom with that Comet
[2:42:49] <%ChaosAethr> the Feels are coming
[2:42:49] <rytisone> chase that ass,clumbo
[2:42:50] <cascadepersona> I love this part of the game so much
[2:42:52] <+RealThiele> virgin comet to the chad meteor
[2:42:55] <joylent_blue> metalsiren31 that's adorable
[2:42:57] <%StaceMcGate> gotta sleep in that bed to advance the plot Pat
[2:43:07] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@StrawberryPantsu) (warning)
[2:43:08] <red_blaster> Pat, can you examine that blur light near the entrance?
[2:43:13] <GarbageQueenEllie> Aerith is a fish confirmed
[2:43:17] <%jepupu> Mermaid
[2:43:23] <%CalderGaming> That ass's days have come to an end
[2:43:29] <+RealThiele> thats why she got those dead fish eyes
[2:43:37] <chaospudding> do you think the cetra vaped?
[2:43:38] <Zebroneath> yeah. there's really two places you HAVE to go to.
[2:43:38] <%edgeyberzerker> I'll always remember Playstation magazine when they had the CD rom preview discs included and the whole cut scene on her death was there. I really wanted to tell my brother to not bother leveling her up. XD
[2:43:50] <red_blaster> Can you examine that blue circle in this building?
[2:43:52] <%StaceMcGate> I remember being stuck on this part for like two days in 97, didn't know i had to sleep to advance the plot
[2:43:55] <+Fox_Rezard> sure wouldnt sleep in that bed if i were y..... oh...
[2:43:56] <King_thunder365> @GarbageQueenEllie "Hmm. Oddly attractive for a fish [woman]."
[2:43:57] <ape_hawk> Shall we advance the plot?
[2:44:02] <JunjiNeato> gotta level for the psn trophy
[2:44:07] <+PlagueOfGripes> that sleep music really kills the mood
[2:44:08] <%CalderGaming> "I feel the cosmos"
[2:44:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Europe isn't real
[2:44:10] <%Owkono> bed of the ancients
[2:44:14] <FirearmsInstructor> @edgeyberzerker oh shit really?
[2:44:14] <%supersugoisenpai1> I can sense that ass
[2:44:17] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's like Narnia
[2:44:23] <%radda343> what even does that mean translator man
[2:44:24] <JunjiNeato> i wish europe wasnt real
[2:44:31] <Iggeh0> i can hear the clap of her cheeks
[2:44:37] <FirearmsInstructor> @edgeyberzerker like by mistake?
[2:44:39] <mothdude> Best part of the remake will be the improved translation.
[2:44:41] <chaospudding> this is about as far as I got playing the game myself, I watched a friend beat the rest over a long weekend
[2:44:42] <supuhmagikarp> missed the emney skill
[2:44:43] <+Valentttine> that name is really gonna lessen the emotional impact lol
[2:44:44] <cythegaeta> Clumbo, redbull 13, and knuckles out to save the world this sounds like a fanfic
[2:44:48] <Zebroneath> "I fell ASS4DAYZ spiritual pressure..."
[2:44:52] <+PlagueOfGripes> Aeris' large, life giving ass is calling me to it
[2:45:05] <joylent_blue> Fujiwara_92 LUL its no use
[2:45:07] <%CalderGaming> Soon she will return to the Ass-stream
[2:45:13] <%StaceMcGate> Aerith's ass has a power level of 50,000
[2:45:14] <JunjiNeato> @cythegaeta the best kind of fanfic
[2:45:16] <cascadepersona> Cloud, running around at the speed of spund
[2:45:21] <+RealThiele> aerith is trying to get to the ancients, but shes dummythicc and the clap of her ass cheeks is alerts the jenova guards?
[2:45:23] <%edgeyberzerker> @FirearmsInstructor Yeah... though now that I think about it, it was a different magazine because there was a preview for Toshinden URA on it. (the reason I got that magazine) it was all FF7 previews too and that cut scene was the one they chose jerks XD
[2:45:25] <red_blaster> I remember that if you examine that blue glowing circle in that builing you get a scene of Cloud getting a headache and saying something. Does anybody remember this?
[2:45:25] <FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue Wait wtf is he trying to do?
[2:45:33] <cythegaeta> She is on her way to the ASSter life
[2:45:37] <chaospudding> cloud hears the ass clap
[2:45:37] <%StaceMcGate> nope
[2:45:40] <shiny_prinny> wrong way
[2:45:40] <mothdude> That's for later.

[2:46:13] <Corvellia> You come back here with [redacted]
[2:46:20] <+PlagueOfGripes> "Local man with powerful nostalgia for game recalls nothing about it"
[2:46:21] <chaospudding> is that fish a hologram or something?
[2:46:22] <FirearmsInstructor> @joylent_blue also I read that in Sonic's voice... god damnit

[2:49:52] <rytisone> quickly use phoenix down
[2:49:52] <zenith0111> FOR DOMINANCE
[2:49:55] <Sp3ctre48> LUL
[2:49:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> MLG 360 NO SCOPE
[2:49:55] <savagedeviljayho> in the new threat mod you can revive her with a phoenix down LUL
[2:49:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Seph knows what he needs to do
[2:49:58] <smallboops> i hope this scene a MESS of blood in the remake
[2:49:58] <%ChaosAethr> you trolls
[2:49:59] <%StaceMcGate> Sephiroth doesn't respect the booty
[2:50:06] <Juanshonium> just use a phenix down

[2:50:10] <%supersugoisenpai1> This is so sad. Alexa, play Aerith's theme.
[2:50:11] <King_thunder365> @wjones0415 Eh, not really. Tifa's ultimately more Cloud's girl than Aerith since she was Zack's girl first. But, I get what you're saying.
[2:50:11] <+PlagueOfGripes> I always liked his reaction of interrupting Seph's stupid monologue
[2:50:16] <FalseEyeD> PAT GONNA CRY

[2:50:27] <%AncelDeLambert> Fuck you Sephy
[2:50:27] <TalisKanju> No more Ass4Dayz
[2:50:28] <%StaceMcGate> a surprisingly bloodless death
[2:50:28] <peachy996> So he dropped in to do a downward slash only for it to be a stab?
[2:50:32] <+machshop> my dick's hard
[2:50:32] <whimsicallifestyle> Ass4Dayz nooooo
[2:50:33] <zenith0111> Ass4Dayz? WTF did I miss
[2:50:33] <TheApeGatsby> my dick is hard

[2:50:46] <%lethallunacyx> Stupid robot
[2:50:48] <cythegaeta> quick cloud motorboat her titties back to life
[2:50:48] <%vaporousTippler> Sad is for people, Cloud. Stop it.
[2:50:51] <+machshop> here fight my mom
[2:50:51] <%jepupu> Splortch
[2:50:54] <peachy996> gay
[2:50:54] <%radda343> "lol sorry I killed your girlfriend. Now fight my mom"
[2:50:54] <AliceAstro> clumbo is big stumbo
[2:50:55] <%Garthunox> before this did a FF character ever die?
[2:50:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SEPH FILLED HER HEART WITH LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
[2:51:00] <%spiritofmojave> the big gay
[2:51:03] <+StrawberryPantsu> JANOVA
[2:51:04] <%Garthunox> oh the old man in 5
[2:51:05] <grayjammer> Her dayz.... are now over
[2:51:06] <%vaporousTippler> Galuf's death was better.
[2:51:07] <%AncelDeLambert> the boss fight happening to this music is the most most anything has ever mosted
[2:51:08] <chaospudding> half the cast in 4 died
[2:51:08] <$onlypuppet> Huh?
[2:51:09] <P3r50n4> like i fucking love this game, and this scene was brilliant and nostalgic, but in retrospect, aeris was generic as fuck
[2:51:09] <%StaceMcGate> boss kinda ruins the emotional moment eh?
[2:51:10] <korth367> holy shit
[2:51:11] <savagedeviljayho> @Garthunox Galuf from 5
[2:51:12] <%olaksi> @Garthunox Galuf never forget
[2:51:12] <lotharrio> Jenova is basically the alien from the movie, the Thing, right?
[2:51:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> no more ass
[2:51:14] <%Keyd00d> Keyd00d subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 30 months! 
[2:51:15] <FalseEyeD> Weird fight is weird
[2:51:16] <%edgeyberzerker> Sephiroth is such a shit lord, killing their friend and making them fight a boss through their grief
[2:51:17] <+PlagueOfGripes> I always liked to bring Omnislash into this fight, with a Nail Bat
[2:51:17] <%VashyronM> This is jarring music for a Jenova fight
[2:51:18] <JetpackMcQuack> bubbles whipV
[2:51:20] <shiny_prinny> so i guess in the remake that orb will explode into a jenova or something?
[2:51:20] <peachy996> Aqualung? Sitting on the park bench?
[2:51:24] <JunjiNeato> @garthunox loads of people in 4 die
[2:51:28] <Blank9> Yeah Galuf was a way better death scene
[2:51:28] <%StaceMcGate> @lotharrio The Thing + Lavos
[2:51:35] <+RealThiele> spin 2 win
[2:51:36] <Daxalog> uh oh
[2:51:36] <%InugamiTheHound> I love the music for this boss fight

[2:51:38] <+PlagueOfGripes> oh no, don't spin like that
[2:51:39] <%ChaosAethr> oh no

[2:52:00] <ranarath> Bunch of party members die in FF2. :D
[2:52:04] <joylent_blue> summons don't get reflected chat
[2:52:04] <+RealThiele> booooo
[2:52:04] <+Pharmakokinetic> I really wonder how the remake is going to handle this section
[2:52:06] <%ChaosAethr> Oof
[2:52:08] <mothdude> Yeah Jenova is absolutely the thing. Comes from meteor, shapeshifts into people, turns other people into monsters.
[2:52:09] <%ChaosAethr> Luckly
[2:52:15] <MassConnect> I don't remember the summon sounding that much like farts

[2:52:28] <ape_hawk> 420
[2:52:28] <FirearmsInstructor> 420
[2:52:29] <%vaporousTippler> FF2 literally has a bonus game (in later versions) where the dead characters form a party in Heaven.
[2:52:31] <%AncelDeLambert> this fight goes so fast with water breath
[2:52:33] <FirearmsInstructor> @ape_hawk ha
[2:52:34] <ranarath> @AliceAstro yes
[2:52:34] <zenith0111> I'm your mother Kappa
[2:52:35] <OldManDeckardCain> 420 BLUE BLAZE IT
[2:52:43] <+Pharmakokinetic> especially Sephiroth specifically since almost everything we see in the game is just Jenova spawn
[2:52:43] <+RealThiele> bong rips for Aerith
[2:52:48] <joylent_blue> AliceAstro if it sounds off-key or something, that's a twitch bug, try refreshing
[2:52:56] <+PlagueOfGripes> the fact that Jenova is just The Thing really gets glossed over a lot
[2:53:00] <%ChaosAethr> Chat what Part of jenova would this be again?

[2:54:04] <+StrawberryPantsu> Use an ether!
[2:54:05] <+RealThiele> mind goblin is taking massive dmaage atm
[2:54:10] <joylent_blue> he used it because the w-item glitch exists

[2:54:12] <%Garthunox> does no one know about the 99 item glitch?
[2:54:15] <%Faustgesicht> F for the first item pat used
[2:54:15] <startstoprepeat> they made this fight purposefully really easy to make sure nobody would have to sit through aerith dying twice
[2:54:18] <+Plaxer> the mind goblins are gone PogChamp

[2:56:10] <lotharrio> @Bailey__gaming That magic deals with "faint" or "wound." Not actual death.
[2:56:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @Bailey__gaming yes but vidjyahgaemz
[2:56:11] <+BlockingDisabled> Tifa probably whispered into her ear "He's mine now, bitch!"

[2:56:47] <+PlagueOfGripes> Aeris just won the game, by the way. Cloud just needs to stay away from Sephiroth and everything will be fine

[2:57:04] <%Keyd00d> They establish in FF5 that if you super duper die real hard phoenix downs don't work

[2:58:06] <Corvellia> @AngriestPat Do you think in remake part 3 we will get to see that smackdown Cloud gives Aerith?
[2:58:08] <%StaceMcGate> @AngriestPat Is Disc 2 your favorite part?
[2:58:10] <%InugamiTheHound> I remember playing ff7 and getting to this part blew my mind when I was a kid

[2:58:21] <Fujiwara_92> Flanders
[2:58:24] <rytisone> stupid sexy flanders
[2:58:26] <%JohnAtDawn> I think he means Stark
[2:58:26] <%Grimlockfly> the babbies don't know
[2:58:26] <%Bailey__gaming> Gold Saucer is disk 2 yeah?
[2:58:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> TOO BAD
[2:58:28] <Aydarkzero> oh... OH
[2:58:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> That Aerith dies?
[2:58:30] <%StaceMcGate> 60% of the time, it works everytime
[2:58:31] <%spiritofmojave> OHHH
[2:58:32] <OldManDeckardCain> "people" more like babies LUL
[2:58:32] <+TheSaintJohn> what am ned?
[2:58:32] <lyzejag> One Guy doesn't know
[2:58:34] <$onlypuppet> I want a hot shower, my back hurts
[2:58:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE
[2:58:35] <FalseEyeD> Recording them
[2:58:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Okely dokely, Pat
[2:58:39] <lotharrio> Yeah everyone knows... that General Leo dies.
[2:58:39] <+ckangaroo15k> Wait, Ned Start dies?
[2:58:40] <redrins> maude?
[2:58:43] <%Ipsenscastle> everybody knows though
[2:58:49] <+RealThiele> restart the spoiler clock? meh
[2:58:50] <smallboops> its going to be pretty cool seeing a bunch of kids shit their pants over it
[2:58:51] <TikanZK> more than 5 lol
[2:58:52] <%trustycoyote> Or people forgot lol
[2:58:52] <%supersugoisenpai1> Do you think Square learned how impactful good voice acting can be from NieR?
[2:58:52] <zamzoph> @AngriestPat don't worry about it. Aeris Dies all day.
[2:58:53] <shiny_prinny> everyone just says "it's a 20 year old game"
[2:58:53] <Tracazoid> Ahh yes, the Red Wedding issue. 3 seasons of book readers going, "I can't wait for everyone's reaction."
[2:58:55] <%Keyd00d> 5 years sure LUL
[2:58:56] <+StrawberryPantsu> Not my problem it's out on ever current console
[2:58:57] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> if they just rearrange the story and she dies in part 1 everyone gets to be shocked all over
[2:58:58] <Zebroneath> It's a spoiler that everyone and their children knows
[2:59:01] <MassConnect> no joke, I know a guy that hasn't played any ff game
[2:59:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> The people that are shrieking about spoilers for FF7 are being ridiculous.
[2:59:02] <%Ipsenscastle> It's in Wreck It Ralph for Christs sake
[2:59:03] <%AncelDeLambert> everybody knows and you've had twenty years to learn
[2:59:04] <%JohnAtDawn> How many people will grind to lvl 99 in Midgar?
[2:59:05] <+wvuboii> original RE3 stream?
[2:59:06] <$onlypuppet> It has been awhile
[2:59:07] <Blank9> everyone knows, there's a website for it after all
[2:59:07] <%Alpha8087> What she doing?
[2:59:08] <AliceAstro> yaayy]
[2:59:10] <FirearmsInstructor> @AngriestPat Plot twist: They kill Tifa instead D:< SPOILERS
[2:59:11] <%spiritofmojave> How could people not know, can't be THAT old right
[2:59:12] <joylent_blue> yayyyyy DS2 strim
[2:59:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BALLERSWAGBRO 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO
[2:59:12] <%PlainSimpleTailor> AFTER COITUS???
[2:59:13] <%CalderGaming> at least with Remake there will be at least one "full product" with Aerith surviving
[2:59:15] <%Valdorick> Hey, hey kids watching right now... King Kong dies at the end, Bruce Willis is a ghost, Snape kills Dumbledor, and IT WAS HIS SLED
[2:59:16] <%edgeyberzerker> I feel like FF7 part two is going to either end at her death or after you give sepiroth the black materia
[2:59:16] <ape_hawk> whats paige strimmin?
[2:59:17] <HyperBomb21> Thanks for the Stream Lord Pat @AngriestPat
[2:59:19] <Charuzu> what is Paige playing today?
[2:59:20] <redrins> season of the dawn is good
[2:59:23] <AliceAstro> wash ur balls before then
[2:59:26] <HyperBomb21> atpQuan atpQuan
[2:59:27] <+Forente> had this spoiled for me by a porn site!
[2:59:29] <+RealThiele> can do wife beating in FF14 soon
[2:59:31] <%CalderGaming> CHEX QUEST STILL LIVES
[2:59:34] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Imagine some kid born in 2010 buys remake...
[2:59:35] <+RealThiele> ruby weapon trial
[2:59:37] <%StaceMcGate> Paige is playing Dark Souls right?
[2:59:40] <+D00msDayDan> good thing undying was trash so our expectations were easily exceeded
[2:59:42] <valachi> You can get the WAD file somewhere
[2:59:44] <Fujiwara_92> re3 stream when
[2:59:47] <%Alpha8087> Teleasto Exotic is pretty great
[2:59:52] <Corvellia> @edgeyberzerker They might as well do it after Aerith dies if they're going to go up to the black materia bit. It'd be better to end an episode with that rather than start one with it
[2:59:53] <Aydarkzero> the Sundial activity is pretty cool and has different bosses every week
[2:59:54] <%VashyronM> I enjoy the Exotic weapon
[2:59:55] <%Alpha8087> Telesto rather
[2:59:57] <redrins> you are gonna get 2 extra nodes for rewards and different bosses
[3:00:07] <%Keyd00d> YEAH WOODY IS GREAT
[3:00:12] <%cvp5127> its the best
[3:00:12] <%supersugoisenpai1> Woody roasts him so hard
[3:00:14] <mrshazboto> "You sound like nobody ever loved you"
[3:00:15] <Aydarkzero> Woody is the GOAT
[3:00:16] <+D00msDayDan> there's an obelisk on 4 planets you upgrade for perks and shit, and all the sundial weapons are good and have new perks, check out the new GL martyr's retribution
[3:00:17] <joylent_blue> actual best scene in the game

[3:00:30] <%CalderGaming> telesto has been around
[3:00:36] <+BlockingDisabled> tppowerFree
[3:00:38] <%Valdorick> Disk 1 is a chonker
[3:00:38] <FirearmsInstructor> @Dingus_Tickler what a name... RPGAyaya
[3:00:39] <%Keyd00d> The other only good part of KH3 is when Sully yeets edgy sora through a bunch of doors
[3:00:40] <+RealThiele> conquering earth sounds hard
[3:00:40] <%supersugoisenpai1> Disc 3 is just the cave
[3:00:44] <+NeonNobleKalzeria> and disc 3 is REALLY short
[3:00:44] <%WhereIsWill> and the weapons
[3:00:46] <Charuzu> isn't disc 2 like the shortest disc?
[3:00:46] <%StaceMcGate> but it has a shit ton of FMVs
[3:00:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> We're about 2/3 done\
[3:00:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[3:00:55] <joylent_blue> D:
[3:00:55] <%Grimlockfly> wooooow
[3:00:57] <Corvellia> Disc 3 is just fmv to be honest
[3:00:57] <mothdude> 3 is shortest.
[3:01:00] <%AncelDeLambert> no chocobo breeding?
[3:01:03] <%StaceMcGate> Challenge accepted
[3:01:03] <rytisone> breed those chocobos
[3:01:03] <%drabberfaun535> uh oh
[3:01:04] <Aydarkzero> i don't even remember ff7!
[3:01:05] <+D00msDayDan> but how will woolie get off now?
[3:01:06] <FirearmsInstructor> easier LUL
[3:01:09] <%Valdorick> I have never gotten Knights of the Round.
[3:01:11] <%Valdorick> Not once.
[3:01:11] <%AncelDeLambert> The last boss fight is kinda unimpressive
[3:01:13] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Knights of the round might as well be a cheat code
[3:01:13] <OlavOlavsson> kotr is really not necessary if youre not doing weapons
[3:01:19] <xeros720> yeah, it's not too hard
[3:01:20] <%AbnormalVoid> Disc 3 is legit last dungeon
[3:01:23] <%Grimlockfly> next best would be Bahumut Zero?
[3:01:25] <%AbnormalVoid> that's it
[3:01:34] <%ThatOneGameTester> i beat it with only meteo rain as my highest limit break, was a struggle
[3:01:35] <xeros720> the real issue you might run into is the other party being completely underleveled
[3:01:40] <Corvellia> @AbnormalVoid They had to fit all those fmvs somewhere
[3:01:42] <%StaceMcGate> Disc 3 has final dungeon, ultimate weapons, and small cutscenes
[3:01:47] <%Valdorick> We're almost to the point where we can say "FUCK YOU! Its January!" again
[3:01:50] <%Grimlockfly> Bahamut in FF 7 is the shit
[3:01:56] <+RealThiele> the weapon fights probably eats a lot of data
[3:02:06] <joylent_blue> LUL
[3:02:06] <FirearmsInstructor> @Grimlockfly which one? RPGAyaya
[3:02:08] <%RNGbob> RNGbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 14 months! Are you excited for the re-awakened waifu wars. you fuck have been doing this for 23 years!
