[0:09:08] <MaritimeSpanker> Drinkin Poutin

[0:10:23] <Blank9> the main thing about rock sling is the tracking, poise damage, and long range
[0:10:25] <%TheGuesty> @PatStaresAt are you aware one ending is gotten just by JoJo posing at a statue?
[0:10:30] <Minorou> that's being efficient

[0:26:40] <$Solid_Stro> So are cracked pots just dead babies of the jar people?
[0:26:43] <bxdragon> Da poop castle

[0:33:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt just so you know, invisible floors exist
[0:33:37] <@QueequegTheater> EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
[0:33:38] <theghosttcatt> 100hours in and i just dident know
[0:33:39] <%cade_calrayn> I used it to mark the ones I've *not* done
[0:33:43] <%THATGUY_789> the best still is the FF14 map teleportation
[0:33:47] <%Dakuu75> better to mark any that you find as a favorite, then remove from the list when complete
[0:33:50] <%notsoy> illusory floors or invisible floors?
[0:33:50] <Aussie_Manny> Favourites, BAH! It's much better as a checklist!
[0:33:50] <teshtestyes> you just need to read the button inputs its all there at the bottom of the screen
[0:33:55] <HystericalCH> for favourites or not, the best use is for marking off cleared areas
[0:33:56] <Aussie_Manny> excuse you
[0:33:58] <Zourath> I use it to mark places I like for invading.
[0:34:00] <XxMoliciousxX> is that gwyn's sword?
[0:34:02] <lyzejag> Gottem
[0:34:18] <%shootbang_exe> really?
[0:34:22] <scrumbotime> Basilisks
[0:34:22] <%KishinGrek> is there a theory as to when this is in the DS time line?
[0:34:31] <%Valdorick> My head cannon is that this is Post Dark Souls, in every way. Its the Light the "let the fire die" Firekeeper saw.
[0:34:32] <lyzejag> You think so ?
[0:34:33] <%Kevlar_Caviar> @PatStaresAt i know you hate musicals so this is more for paige: i watched Jesus Christ Superstar last night and loved it, i think it'll be my new easter tradition
[0:34:36] <%bundle_of_herbs> maybe on like a different archtree
[0:34:37] <%epide> no i ment world layout like realworld space like how they made it
[0:34:39] <%Archmortal> so in Dark Souls sorcery is based off of cosmic power
[0:34:39] <$OfficerMods> @PatStaresAt I'm at a loss what do paintings actually DOOOOO
[0:34:40] <%THATGUY_789> it's Ancient Aliens
[0:34:41] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, the lore talks about a time of ancient dragons
[0:34:41] <ohno58> lightning works against dragon's stone scales
[0:34:43] <ebrion> Its just the millionth cycle od DS
[0:34:45] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[0:34:45] <%luftraumm1> LIGHT = TIME is still unconfirmesd
[0:34:45] <$bravebravesrobin> Drangleic too?
[0:34:48] <%TheAdMerlin> Wasn't Japan also called the land of reeds in Dark Souls?
[0:34:48] <Sunstalker> How did you sorty by new?D:
[0:34:50] <+kinghats> like the Alabaster Lords
[0:34:53] <%cade_calrayn> Also, a "Formeless Mother" that's the outer god of blood
[0:34:53] <+OneTrueAsshat> It’s much closer to bloodborne imo
[0:34:59] <digaogrunge> Also Kingsfield and Armored Core
[0:35:00] <%Valdorick> Also, Grace look like Humanity.
[0:35:01] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt There's even lore about how the dragons used to have Stone Scales which is what Gravelstone is
[0:35:02] <%Jerp> also dark souls was originally meant to be called dark ring, and I think along with the other lore stuff between the games, I want to believe there's some connected shenanigans
[0:35:14] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> there is one near renna's tower
[0:35:17] <%greasypete00> fuck off there can't be
[0:35:17] <+alphonseisbest> IT IS TRUE I FOU D IT
[0:35:20] <Sunstalker> No, not right next to it pat. its in the ruins closer to Ranni's
[0:35:21] <rottingpastry> the description of paintings implies they're like those dumb treasure maps that some games have
[0:35:24] <+badhaye> Fought an NPC that def made me decide to do a dual whip build next
[0:35:25] <Sunstalker> And its an invisible floor
[0:35:25] <scrumbotime> look for an invisible wizard, i am not joking
[0:35:27] <%Archmortal> it's not right next to his house
[0:35:28] <+thickshield> oh yeah, look for a dreg sorcerer
[0:35:28] <%cade_calrayn> It's close to Ranni's
[0:35:39] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Yes
[0:35:40] <Sunstalker> the wiki's awful about it
[0:35:43] <ohno58> its between ranni and renna's tower
[0:35:48] <%KishinGrek> what's the current timeline? Bloodborne-Demon-Dark-Dark 2-Dark 3?
[0:35:50] <%Jerp> invizard jerpMagic
[0:35:51] <it_came_from_outer_space> I think the trick is "haha gottem"
[0:35:54] <MaritimeSpanker> indivisable woorl
[0:35:55] <scrumbotime> Yes, that's how i got the idea for it
[0:35:58] <oda_flobunaga> There is an item for the Physic upgrade that gives you infinite FP for like 10 seconds
[0:35:59] <%Dakuu75> I keep watching other streamers go through Limgrave and then going "Oh shit, I NEVER GOT THAT THING!"
[0:36:00] <Sunstalker> The wizard just there to catch your attention
[0:36:01] <@Fuggins4U> Deus Ex: invisible war
[0:36:04] <mar_krow> Both have it
[0:36:05] <@Ranryu692> the one invisible floor I've found did have an invisible wizard nearby
[0:36:07] <NewWillinium> Yep!
[0:36:08] <%epide> yeah it does
[0:36:08] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah, it does
[0:36:09] <+thickshield> it do
[0:36:09] <radiorosewater> hey guys, should i have beer, rum, or vodka?
[0:36:11] <%furiousfurioso> I think the trick is it seems that *every* single ruin has a basement
[0:36:21] <scrumbotime> Told ya so, invisible wizard trick
[0:36:24] <%cade_calrayn> Remember her imprisoned body, Pat? It's related to that
[0:36:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Im doing her questline rn
[0:36:26] <CheezeWolf> yuniiPOG
[0:36:29] <MaritimeSpanker> @radiorosewater rum

[0:36:41] <%boggsz12> that's an omenkiller isn't it
[0:36:42] <scrumbotime> This is where Seluvius "enjoys his puppets"
[0:36:47] <+thickshield> he likes his real dolls
[0:36:50] <ohno58> seluvis was a perv
[0:36:50] <%cade_calrayn> Nepheli would've been here if you gave her the potion
[0:36:52] <Aussie_Manny> Is this the Fortress of Solitude?
[0:36:55] <radiorosewater> I'll just have them all

[0:37:42] <%abakkus> is this why sellen was in 2 places at once?

[0:37:43] <scrumbotime> go tell him you found his sex doll room
[0:37:46] <%greasypete00> you probably find nepheli here if you give the potion to her @patstaresat
[0:37:49] <BrownMcgee> Hey what's wrong with having a couple of living sex puppets
[0:37:51] <MaritimeSpanker> I thought he was ded in your gaem?

[0:38:17] <@QueequegTheater> Thanks Blaidd
[0:38:17] <%Axellogic> You did it
[0:38:17] <%notsoy> somebody found out and murdered him for it i bet

[0:38:22] <eleskei> what
[0:38:23] <%CoffeeKaiju> ????
[0:38:25] <Dabrikishaw> I just found out what the end of his questline was supposed to be. Fuck this guy, he's evil to the core
[0:38:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @patstaresat His puppets kill him during Rannis quest
[0:38:26] <MaritimeSpanker> ALSO READ THAT MAIDEN THING
[0:38:29] <Aussie_Manny> HAHAHAHA
[0:38:30] <MaritimeSpanker> THE SUMMON MAIDEN THING
[0:38:31] <Aussie_Manny> WHO PROFITS??
[0:38:32] <+thickshield> puppets specifically
[0:38:34] <%bundle_of_herbs> someone clearly snapped his neck
[0:38:34] <Aussie_Manny> LUL
[0:38:36] <jubejube56> Should check in Iji too
[0:38:37] <MaritimeSpanker> IT HAS IMPLICATIONS
[0:38:38] <%mythcreant> unironically love those big fuckin hats
[0:38:41] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Would you like me to answer why?
[0:38:50] <%furiousfurioso> so if you talk to Seluvius he gives you one of those ashes as a hush hush payment
[0:38:50] <%notsoy> read the item descriptions
[0:38:57] <$Solid_Stro> Have you checked on Iji yet?
[0:39:00] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt the Seluvis stuff happens at the end of Sellen's quest, she sends you on several errands first
[0:39:02] <+FattimusSlime> What was the name of the NPC that Pat murdered in jail again?
[0:39:07] <+Kyma1020> There's a dude in Mt
[0:39:08] <Dabrikishaw> @furiousfurioso Yeah.
[0:39:09] <Minorou> you have to find something in the mountain to continue her questline
[0:39:10] <%Nekros4442> @patstaresat could you check on the nice giant blacksmith
[0:39:15] <%shootbang_exe> @PatStaresAt you can find something in Gelmir if you want to do her questline
[0:39:16] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You need to get something on Mt. Gelmir first
[0:39:17] <+thickshield> you need to find azure comet before you can progress her quest i think
[0:39:20] <+Kyma1020> Dude in Mt. Gelmir that you have to find
[0:39:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> I think you skipped an area of her quest with som teleportation nonsense you did
[0:39:33] <TheBlankAce> I'm pretty sure you have to buy at least one sorcery from her to do her quest
[0:39:37] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt To advance on selens quest, you need to head from the virgin capture thingies boss room around the mountain past the fort and up to a grace called azur's grace and talk to azure
[0:39:37] <%RealThiele> yea Gelmir go scrape face
[0:39:44] <+FattimusSlime> @FattimusSlime So she forgave him then?
[0:39:47] <@QueequegTheater> No you didn't
[0:40:04] <@QueequegTheater> I can DM you if you want to know what you need for the quest to advance
[0:40:05] <Aussie_Manny> Thank you, lady.
[0:40:16] <%epide> no u lack an item scrolls not need find the grace primeval sorcerer azur
[0:40:18] <HystericalCH> what is her accent?
[0:40:33] <MaritimeSpanker> the big crystal
[0:40:37] <ohno58> You have to progress her questlilne pat
[0:40:37] <rottingpastry> shouldn't have smoked that shit
[0:40:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> U need to find specific Sorceries to show her the first of which is in Mount Gelmir @patstaresat
[0:40:39] <%Jerp> this quest completely confused me for the longest time
[0:40:46] <Guardiansaiyan> lol...woolie lost?
[0:40:49] <$Solid_Stro> As far as assholes go, these NPCs are no where near as bad as Bloodborne
[0:40:53] <scrumbotime> whuppo welcome to prawn cave full of laser grandpas
[0:41:00] <%tusk102> oop
[0:41:05] <tri3dgE027> Pat, did you return to the three Crystal a-holes already in the caverns?
[0:41:06] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, the Kamehameha spell
[0:41:09] <%luftraumm1> ???
[0:41:10] <+Romuken> where can i farm smithing stone 1's?  they seem to just stop being dropped
[0:41:12] <%tusk102> still trapped
[0:41:12] <Aussie_Manny> What the?
[0:41:13] <jacksawjack> Did you give the second glintstone key to the guy in the church after stormveil.
[0:41:16] <%shootbang_exe> Azur is in Gelmir
[0:41:17] <NewWillinium> Wait don't you only get Azur Comet *after* unlocking the next part of her quest?
[0:41:18] <%luftraumm1> how many puppets are there?
[0:41:18] <tanarath> This feels like Tim Roger's playthrough of CP2077 & how he wasn't sure if weird quest bullshit was a bug, or intended.
[0:41:23] <%watts121> I think he needs to use a Dwe.
[0:41:24] <eleskei> what is up with this lady
[0:41:25] <%watts121> Dew*
[0:41:25] <%MrMegaJackpots> my gelmir
[0:41:28] <Minorou> back to our regularly scheduled programming
[0:41:28] <Aussie_Manny> ANYWAY
[0:41:29] <scrumbotime> I think you actually have to buy her spells, so you can be her "apprentice"
[0:41:31] <Dabrikishaw> I'm using it on my INT build right now and its the tits if you know how to make the most of it.
[0:41:34] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Which is the real one?
[0:41:37] <%Bluwizard21> I am so excited for my bow run of this games
[0:41:37] <%MrMegaJackpots> *mt gelmir
[0:41:38] <+Fenrisulfr_V> This questline REALLY doesn't matter if you aren't an Int build.
[0:41:41] <%tusk102> this games quest progression is so weird
[0:41:49] <%sniffy77> i lost 25k runes at this place
[0:41:53] <@Velyndra> Try Jumping
[0:41:56] <@QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V The implications of it are fascinating though
[0:41:58] <%MrMegaJackpots> payoff is cool tho
[0:42:00] <AgnusLaplace> I have a feeling they will poison those nuts
[0:42:05] <+RedMaskBandit> PokBlaziken
[0:42:09] <+badhaye> Where the hell is this?
[0:42:19] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V True. I still think Goldmask's quest is the MOST interesting, though.
[0:42:20] <%Archmortal> that's what soap is for, wash that stinky poison off
[0:42:25] <%luftraumm1> yelling out your magic is funny as hell
[0:42:28] <+Fenrisulfr_V> My jaw literally dropped whenever it happened.
[0:42:37] <cayitoz> is beast claw talisman the best?
[0:42:42] <%MrMegaJackpots> pat have you tried the blasphemous blade?
[0:42:45] <ape_hawk> i dont think soap works like that, but okay

[0:48:42] <%RealThiele> BNG
[0:48:43] <%luftraumm1> so overlevelled lol
[0:48:51] <Gorgs7> this is weirder than drugs
[0:48:55] <krampus2> it used to be a boss
[0:48:56] <ohno58> Because you're overleveled pat
[0:49:02] <%Archmortal> that enemy doesn't have pocket sand
[0:49:05] <eleskei> at least its not mustard
[0:49:07] <Boombay1213> if he gets going he is dangerous
[0:49:12] <+rafaelba93> there will a way stronger version, dont you worry
[0:49:13] <%notsoy> nose candy would at least make sense but this is inhuman shit
[0:49:14] <deviljhojho_> what is he saying
[0:49:21] <%luftraumm1> whatd the origin of shipoopi?
[0:49:22] <%Dakuu75> ... you guys are so wholesome it's fucking gross
[0:49:24] <doster504> Wait Pat still does the thing where he levels up 80 times then wonders why the game is easy?
[0:49:25] <jubejube56> Does Paige just do shots of ketchup packets in her free time?
[0:49:26] <%MelfinaStarwind> shaboopy
[0:49:37] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i HATE when my boluses are neutralized
[0:49:46] <%sporeian94> you say that now
[0:49:50] <deviljhojho_> its fine
[0:49:50] <+livi242> what I've learned from watching Elden Ring streams is that people would complain if he's under leveled or overlevled
[0:49:50] <%abakkus> a little less min, a little more maxing
[0:49:50] <%notsoy> he still does plenty of dying, don't worry about that yall
[0:49:52] <Slimeking_Mike> aHe was weaker because you killed it before it could start doing its Bullshit
[0:49:53] <%sporeian94> but the endgame will push that turd in
[0:49:59] <@QueequegTheater> Except now he's still getting his ass kicked
[0:50:00] <Dabrikishaw> Yeah, I'm thinking I'll go SL 150 soon myself for my mage.
[0:50:01] <%Archmortal> to be fair this time he only did like 30-40 instead of 80
[0:50:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I can't believe that Pat is already at level 999
[0:50:04] <DanThePumpkinman> imagine complaining about how someone else plays a game lmao
[0:50:07] <NewWillinium> How long did it take you to grind with that one spot from. . . you were right around level 100 last stream right?
[0:50:07] <ebrion> Was that skeleton pooping out of his chest?
[0:50:11] <bluefootedtpeack> tbf with the end game pretty much everything two shots so leveling high isn't too bad
[0:50:12] <+Akizea> can't wait for the second half to absolutely ROCKS pats shit lol
[0:50:22] <tanarath> What sword is that?
[0:50:31] <deviljhojho_> this place is a fucking shithole
[0:50:39] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @tanarath Gargoyle's Black Blade.
[0:50:39] <jacksawjack> I hate the multi-armed fuck daemons.
[0:50:44] <doster504> I wasn't complaining that he leveled up calm down colored names that go up
[0:50:50] <@QueequegTheater> LUL
[0:50:56] <Dabrikishaw> I would kill for as Vigor and Mind as what Pat has right now, but I like my Darkmoon Greatsword and Moonlit Katana.
[0:51:04] <+Totally_Not_Toby> maybe it is maybe its really cool and fun :)
[0:51:07] <%twistedj3ster> I cheated in 16k that I lost because I got on my horsie and the horsie didn't appear and then I took fall damage and died
[0:51:10] <%Archmortal> so it's NOT just poison after all
[0:51:21] <%cade_calrayn> oh FUCK yeah. Pat, I just found the Rotten Crystal Staff used by those goddamn rotten Crystalians
[0:51:23] <%sporeian94> Malenia out here spreading Covid to the entire lands between cause her helmet doesn't cover her mouth and nose
[0:51:26] <it_came_from_outer_space> I am always impressed by souls characters' ability to not just retch constantly while inhaling foreign substances
[0:51:34] <%cade_calrayn> Does Rot damage in addition to spell damage
[0:51:35] <tanarath> Pat, you've gotta believe in the heart of the cards, it could be worth it, Miyazaki would NEVER lie to you.
[0:51:35] <deviljhojho_> oh i remember that guy
[0:51:40] <jacksawjack> Even with that much health he can still be one shot by random mobs
[0:51:42] <jubejube56> God imagine scarlet rot, poison, and deathblight all squeezed into a little corner
[0:51:47] <Slimeking_Mike> Yeah even overlevelled he’s only like, what, killing shit in only 1 hit less than someone who is on par with the “””””intended””””” level for this zone
[0:51:59] <MaritimeSpanker> From Pats nutz
[0:52:04] <@Mechz71> getting them from your mom
[0:52:14] <%Kevlar_Caviar> OOOHHHHH
[0:52:20] <$cade_calrayn> The game kind of intends for you to dump runes into survivability over power
[0:52:28] <deviljhojho_> you couldnt possibly even imagine
[0:52:29] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt You gone back to redmane castle yet for the original bossfight there? It gives you one of the legendary Ultra Greatswords

[0:54:36] <XxMoliciousxX> women's day? time to stream life is strange
[0:54:37] <Slimeking_Mike> good plan, this place whips
[0:54:43] <%chiazam> Where even is this?
[0:54:44] <%twistedj3ster> go get it coward
[0:54:47] <%cade_calrayn> i know, lol, he was trying to get up there in his own pathetic way
[0:54:54] <fumbles_tho> @luftraumm1 Not if you cast heat metal
[0:54:58] <radiorosewater> teaowlBlank
[0:55:04] <MaritimeSpanker> @jacksawjack if you use a prostethic, wouldn't every time be "the stranger" but the stranger that knows just how to tug your chain?
[0:55:07] <+tizziks> Heard there are hidden doors  you need to roll into, not hit.  Is that true?
[0:55:09] <radiorosewater> just do it
[0:55:09] <jacksawjack> I'm still wondering how you get ensh to attack you for that armor
[0:55:12] <%luftraumm1> @luftraumm1 then it scalds
[0:55:19] <signofzeta> building a castle on top of a sinkhole
[0:55:21] <ShibuyaTomato> gives the place character
[0:55:21] <signofzeta> CLASSIC
[0:55:24] <%twistedj3ster> it's not covered under their homeowners insurance
[0:55:26] <vicar_anat> Not up to code, city hall's gonna get invovled
[0:55:26] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> Has Paige ever considered playing the MediEvil Remake on stream i think she'd enjoy it
[0:55:27] <oda_flobunaga> So, there's a ash of war that gives stabbers lifesteal
[0:55:27] <deviljhojho_> shameful
[0:55:28] <Emerald_Emperor> well they built it over a vat to start with
[0:55:34] <%SveriSageAdvice> they gave up on this castle unlike the dudes in Monty Python who built three in a swamp
[0:55:37] <Slimeking_Mike> They built the castle on a swamp
[0:55:38] <Augus7717> did pat check out the four belfries?
[0:55:43] <%Kevlar_Caviar> i still have no idea what sleep does because it's used by like, 2 enemies
[0:55:44] <%Axellogic> The fuck does that smoke even do
[0:55:48] <$OfficerMods> maybe in flordia
[0:55:51] <jacksawjack> It's the Monty Paython castle in the marsh
[0:55:52] <+Totally_Not_Toby> that counts as an act of god probably
[0:55:52] <Gorgs7> is in Chicago
[0:55:53] <%ThomasOfTroy> I think my insurance actually would cover that
[0:55:55] <@QueequegTheater> Act of God
[0:55:57] <it_came_from_outer_space> imported from blighttown
[0:55:58] <%chiazam> Wait is this Stormveil Castle?
[0:56:03] <jubejube56> Pat did the belfries yes
[0:56:04] <deviljhojho_> this is gonna be shit for non faith builds
[0:56:04] <ebrion> Holmes on Homes, Elden Ring
[0:56:15] <Slimeking_Mike> It’s literally the swamp castle from monty python that sank into the swamp like 5 times
[0:56:18] <%abakkus> i distantly remember an old parable about not building a house on sand... perhaps you shouldnt build on a poison swamp either
[0:56:18] <Sunstalker> shieldless builds maybe
[0:56:28] <bassoontyphoon> What’s the poison/status effect swamps counter at now??
[0:56:32] <tanarath> Is this the 20th poison swamp?
[0:56:38] <@PrefectusCorgi> This remind me of Monty Python Holy Garil bit with the Castle in the swamp
[0:56:41] <jacksawjack> It's almost like they intend for you to go up the cliff and not the lift
[0:56:43] <%Axellogic> MSithing stone 3s are what I always struggled with before I got bell
[0:56:46] <%luftraumm1> @Slimeking_Mike gotta get the prince married to a princess with HUGE tracks of land
[0:56:48] <Emerald_Emperor> these perfumers are insane
[0:56:51] <%Axellogic> Instant +20 once I had bell
[0:56:56] <oda_flobunaga> I think I know why status effect AOEs do real damage too.  I don't think summons can be status effected.
[0:56:58] <%sniffy77> Maybe they thought the poison would give added protection, but then they forgot about the consequences of living on poison
[0:57:01] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Those guys are assholes
[0:57:04] <%Maids4lyfe> look the first castle sank into the swamp, the second also sank, the third caught fire and fell over and sank into the swamp now the fourth castle, that one stood just fine
[0:57:11] <%Archmortal> Pocket.  Sand.

[0:57:20] <deviljhojho_> of all things
[0:57:31] <urkleturtle> it's weird that boss/uniques weapons are super easy to upgrade in this game, but the regular ones are super limited
[0:57:33] <deviljhojho_> NO
[0:57:34] <eleskei> now u can make urself smell nice cool

[0:59:29] <Gorgs7> that is what you want to shit
[0:59:30] <+Pilau32> thats why bugs dont die from fall damage
[0:59:33] <%TheAdMerlin> It's Square Cube law because in 3d space every Square becomes a cube

[1:02:15] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hey Pat. What was the most obnoxious class you had to take in college? I’m taking this philosophy class but each paper has to be peer reviewed and our teacher refuses to look at our papers before the due date. Have you had any similar shitty professors?
[1:02:15] <NewWillinium> These Assholes feel like they come straight from Sekiro
[1:02:22] <%abakkus> this is why my besties discord has a #cursed channel. its just us taking turns seeing who can make everyone go "shut the fuck up!" the loudest
[1:02:22] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> heal
[1:02:26] <%chiazam> Sometimes Pat's refusal to heal ASTOUNDS me
[1:02:42] <%fat_burtreynolds> C r a f t i n g
[1:02:46] <%Bluwizard21> @NewWillinium Wait till you see malenia
[1:02:46] <ohno58> pat heal
[1:02:47] <%epide> thats a preety good item
[1:03:11] <penitentpendant> Oh well, just have to level more to even stats out
[1:03:22] <@QueequegTheater> Kappa
[1:03:24] <%luftraumm1> just use beast vit
[1:03:24] <signofzeta> how much vitality did you level?
[1:03:33] <@QueequegTheater> @signofzeta 45
[1:03:33] <penitentpendant> (Also, FTH likes high health since it has those lovely heal spells~)
[1:03:34] <Sunstalker> I hit max flasks before ever progressing north of the capital D:
[1:03:39] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt What's your health pat? Cause mines almost 1700 and enemy combos still one shot me with heavy armor
[1:03:39] <NewWillinium> @Bluwizard21 I believe that I'm near her now actually. Or so I've been told.
[1:03:43] <bluefootedtpeack> that's progress, the other way is the detour
[1:03:44] <%chiazam> Wouldn't be Pat without "I grinded a lil offscreen"
[1:03:53] <NewWillinium> Not 60 Faith?
[1:03:53] <signofzeta> i'm at 50 vit currently
[1:03:56] <Augus7717> damn dude thats kinda low
[1:03:58] <%mythcreant> asking for myself - is there any point not to level the fuck out of yourself early on? or do you want to save that rune/grace pile for anything in particular?
[1:04:13] <%Cjjb1995> the boss at the end of her quest f*cking kicked my ass
[1:04:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> Which stat did you feel you hit your first soft cap
[1:04:22] <HystericalCH> this game's endgame enemy damage is intense
[1:04:30] <%mythcreant> valid!
[1:04:32] <$OfficerMods> @mythcreant how much an asshole are you? This is a serious question.
[1:04:33] <$Solid_Stro> Bai Ranni
[1:04:33] <%mythcreant> just a coward <3
[1:04:44] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Oh right..
[1:04:45] <penitentpendant> TBF, 'leveling = exploration' in this game honestly
[1:04:52] <%mythcreant> @OfficerMods i'm low on the asshole meter
[1:04:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> 5 your time is 4 my time. damn
[1:04:59] <ebrion> Is that enemy called the Aristocrats?
[1:04:59] <%Archmortal> the rune-grace pile will be eaten through early if you're a caster or like buying stuff from merchants
[1:05:04] <%chiazam> I kind of want to play 100% of the game without grinding
[1:05:09] <%TheGuesty> bold choice to not help menu pause
[1:05:14] <%Cjjb1995> these spider enemies being everywhere confuses me lore wise, I was under the impression Godryck had made them by well....grafting them, how are they all over the world?
[1:05:18] <$OfficerMods> ok @mythcreant then don't worry about it, keeping your level low is only good for invasions
[1:05:21] <oda_flobunaga> That's a human centipede
[1:05:27] <HystericalCH> grinding is absolutely not necessary if you explore
[1:05:28] <%twistedj3ster> I like just how many places Pat's been where he has rightfully declared they suck shit
[1:05:28] <%cade_calrayn> Gief requires a KNIFE
[1:05:29] <%Order_of_Mystery> what sword is Pat using?
[1:05:31] <+Pilau32> was that the nameless king?
[1:05:32] <@QueequegTheater> @chiazam You can, I beat the superboss at 15 levels below what Pat is now
[1:05:42] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> why does twitch refuse to tell me when my favorite streamer is streaming
[1:05:43] <%chiazam> @TheGuesty help menu pause?
[1:05:44] <tanarath> baby needs food badly
[1:05:52] <%mythcreant> @OfficerMods noted!
[1:06:02] <oda_flobunaga> Mogh is nothing compared to Milenia
[1:06:03] <%Order_of_Mystery> oh you killed the gargoyle near gurranq? nice

[1:06:23] <%greasypete00> how did you cheat
[1:06:23] <ExpressNode> Can you craft grease materials?
[1:06:27] <%greasypete00> I see
[1:06:33] <Alrom> Has anyone used grease items in this game? Watched so many streamers and none ever use them
[1:06:38] <urkleturtle> I'm really bummed that restoring a boss soul in a mausuleum doesn't let you get two of the same weapon to powerstance
[1:06:41] <%Order_of_Mystery> true dark souls strats
[1:06:43] <Gorgs7> it's because humans have fucked bulldogs physiology beyond belief
[1:06:43] <%xcompleasedad> @PatStaresAt Have you made it to the Capitol yet?
[1:06:49] <Sunstalker> DUDE, seluvis just offered to betray Ranni. D:
[1:06:55] <%Agami23> gargoyles in this game sucks, they are immune to like every status effect
[1:07:05] <%Nobrev> after I leveled to 110 naturally the grind just got to be too big so I had a friend that duped a bunch of runes drop me enough to just boost to 180
[1:07:07] <%Dakuu75> aparently the dragon grease is strong against dragons. (acording to the description) I wanna try that one
[1:07:08] <Augus7717> there is a way to get that gargoyle to throw itself off the map LUL
[1:07:15] <%twistedj3ster> What viscosity do ya need
[1:07:19] <theloganbrand> hakan mains be like

[1:08:32] <@QueequegTheater> She is now gone from that location
[1:08:45] <%SveriSageAdvice> i believe you see her again in Windmill village? lemme check
[1:08:47] <Augus7717> Markers you put on the map carry over into new game+ @PatStaresAt
[1:09:05] <Giztech> @PatStaresAt she will be in the north area of the map FYI
[1:09:06] <%Dakuu75> same
[1:09:10] <%RealThiele> yeah @QueequegTheater its village
[1:09:19] <%SveriSageAdvice> ok yeah you'll see her again in the area later after you beat Windmill village
[1:09:20] <Giztech> closer
[1:09:21] <Zourath> She loves having Arms for the Nintendo Switch.
[1:09:23] <ExpressNode> Fuck this game is huge
[1:09:24] <%cade_calrayn> Past the Capital, yeah.
[1:09:25] <%Bluwizard21> no pat
[1:09:27] <%Agami23> north east in atlas platue
[1:09:28] <%Bluwizard21> the north
[1:09:34] <%RealThiele> northern Altus
[1:09:35] <%cade_calrayn> Sorry no, yeah, Windmill Village
[1:09:36] <%hermitsen> ahhh, seems familiar
[1:09:37] <Ghufufin> look at his fancy hat and s word
[1:09:49] <%TheGuesty> did he miss an item?
[1:09:54] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I'm pretty sure you can get to the Capital without ever fighting a boss.  I got to Altus on my new run without a single bossfight after Grafted Scion
[1:09:57] <IminyourBase> hey pat is it possible to spread yourself too thin with weapons and not be able to max them out?
[1:10:06] <%Nobrev> what is the farthest zone pat's gotten to?
[1:10:10] <$OfficerMods> i still don't think fromsoft has made a basic enemy more horriying than mind flayer
[1:10:12] <%Agami23> hey pat, have you see the machine gun shield shit people were doing?
[1:10:13] <bluefootedtpeack> looks like this castle is just storage for cainhursts excess statues.
[1:10:16] <@QueequegTheater> @IminyourBase There is a respec after the second shardbearer
[1:10:20] <%TheGuesty> no he did nopt
[1:10:33] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @OfficerMods Winter Lanterns are pretty bad.
[1:10:38] <%JoshManVGH> When did Pat become the dude from Roundtable Hold?
[1:10:52] <+twdlrr> I saw some guy invading with a cannon on twitter today
[1:10:52] <@QueequegTheater> @IminyourBase Also you can unlock infinite smithing stones at a merchant
[1:10:59] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The halberd she has is incredible for faith characters.
[1:10:59] <AlexJacobVO> Destructo disc?
[1:11:00] <IminyourBase> respec for weapons? i was wondering if you could like too many weapons and then F yourself end game
[1:11:01] <%twistedj3ster> oh look it's Krillin
[1:11:06] <%Brassnarwhal> i have that weapon art it's pretty cool
[1:11:07] <bluefootedtpeack> they were invaders in caelid, they weren't from there i don't think
[1:11:09] <IminyourBase> ahh thanks queequeg
[1:11:19] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Are you gonna save scum and see as many endings as you can?
[1:11:25] <%Mister_McDerp> man, destructo disc is the coolest
[1:11:31] <ape_hawk> wouldnt that make it a dungeon?
[1:11:32] <urkleturtle> j wish these guys's armor wasn't so horribly tedious to farm
[1:11:34] <Gorgs7> heh, gottem
[1:11:35] <jbrachob> its a biggature
[1:11:38] <%Brassnarwhal> @twistedj3ster the really fucked up thing is that the destructo disc miracle looks closer to frieza's throw than krillins
[1:11:42] <%JoshManVGH> Which one?
[1:11:42] <$OfficerMods> the actual differnces between endings are kinda lame
[1:11:59] <AlexJacobVO> Way of White Corona?
[1:12:00] <%greasypete00> well you literally couldn't
[1:12:04] <ExpressNode> More like you couldn't see the bosses because the game is too hard
[1:12:05] <+Fenrisulfr_V> There's three major endings, right?
[1:12:14] <%twistedj3ster> @Brassnarwhal Oh man you're right, there's 2 and they track
[1:12:14] <@QueequegTheater> There are only 3 real endings, the variants are super tacked on
[1:12:15] <+Yesac2004> Why all the statues?
[1:12:15] <MaritimeSpanker> @Fenrisulfr_V 7
[1:12:18] <$OfficerMods> there's two that are really cool and all the rest are mass effect 3 tier red green blue
[1:12:18] <%xcompleasedad> Did they fix the bleed dog in the last zone?
[1:12:23] <%Cjjb1995> FromSoft games tend to be torture to platinum, but from what I've heard Elden Ring's plat isn't that bad
[1:12:27] <penitentpendant> Combo'd!
[1:12:27] <tanarath> f
[1:12:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[1:12:29] <%Nobrev> doglocked
[1:12:29] <MaritimeSpanker> one of which is only listed in the files and is yet unfound
[1:12:29] <%VictorVonLouche> Good shot
[1:12:30] <%hermitsen> ah gotem ggs
[1:12:32] <%RealThiele> good dog
[1:12:33] <%luftraumm1> no overlevelling poor strategy
[1:12:34] <AgnusLaplace> damn, he did it
[1:12:35] <%chiazam> @PatStaresAt will you use new game+ to get different endings or will you start a new save?
[1:12:36] <jbrachob> some bodys getting fucked!
[1:12:36] <%captainpodock> Are tyou playing on console or pc?
[1:12:36] <+grapplingwithdepression> Damn homie just nae nea'd you
[1:12:40] <signofzeta> as always, the dogs are the worst
[1:12:42] <%Pookiedaexzile> COMBOOOOOOOOO
[1:12:42] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @MaritimeSpanker The rune choice ones are all part of the same ending. There's only three actually different endings.
[1:12:43] <%Mister_McDerp> LUL
[1:12:45] <%RealThiele> THE APEX
[1:12:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @QueequegTheater and the animation is closer to how frieza throws them too if im remembering that fight right
[1:12:50] <%TheGuesty> You got "x"'d, that knight's version of a tea bag
[1:12:53] <$Solid_Stro> Well played good sir
[1:12:57] <+thugnasty117> Ko
[1:13:01] <MaritimeSpanker> @Fenrisulfr_V still counts
[1:13:04] <ExpressNode> Why the PS4? Just curious
[1:13:05] <$vehementvadr> jet engine ring time
[1:13:08] <Gorgs7> rofl, I love the itty bitty shield that dude has when he crosses his weapons
[1:13:19] <@QueequegTheater> @Cjjb1995 All major bosses, all endings, all legendary spells/incantations, all legendary talismans, all legendary weapons, and all legendary talismans. Not particularly hard
[1:13:19] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Are you going to stream other playthroughs, or are they going to be off camera?
[1:13:24] <%JoshManVGH> You know what, with how much shit they have in this game, if From doesn't nail the ending, that's totally fine. They have already succeeded with just the sheer amount of quality content.
[1:13:31] <%Archmortal> I'm glad I have the PS4 version, but sad that I have not been able to get a PS5 still
[1:13:45] <%Nobrev> @ExpressNode ps4 version on ps5 has locked 60fps while the ps5 version on ps5 doesn't
[1:13:46] <Augus7717> wonder how long its gonna take till they announce DLC for Elden Ring
[1:14:00] <%RealThiele> itsa party
[1:14:03] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater Are you on PC, by chance? I really need help with a weapon I missed for the Legendary armaments achievement.
[1:14:03] <%JoshManVGH> Daaw
[1:14:04] <%Saadi90> The PS4 version on PS5 runs way way way better
[1:14:09] <@QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V No
[1:14:11] <@QueequegTheater> PS5
[1:14:16] <jacksawjack> where'd you power level at?
[1:14:17] <%Cjjb1995> @Cjjb1995 DS1 & 2 fucking sucked to platinum, getting all the sorceries required ALOT of grinding
[1:14:19] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Damn.
[1:14:20] <%MelfinaStarwind> psaElmo
[1:14:22] <ExpressNode> @Nobrev Oh yeah I forgot about how that was mentioned.
[1:14:23] <%JumboCrunchies> Where is Pat right now?
[1:14:34] <@QueequegTheater> @Fenrisulfr_V The elden ring subreddit can probably help out
[1:14:36] <eleskei> wow
[1:14:37] <%Valdorick> Instant Rot
[1:14:42] <@Ranryu692> damn
[1:14:42] <ExpressNode> And it gives rot. Thats fucked
[1:14:45] <%JoshManVGH> Rot stab
[1:14:46] <tanarath> f
[1:14:46] <penitentpendant> Man, this one knight keeps stylin' on Pat
[1:14:47] <%abakkus> jeeeeeeeeeeeeez
[1:14:48] <%TheGuesty> Capra Demon encounter!
[1:14:49] <%Agami23> int is so stupid, i love it
[1:14:49] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck
[1:14:51] <oda_flobunaga> Get your rot on
[1:14:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> DOG PACK
[1:14:59] <NewWillinium> @JumboCrunchies Hasn't done the Capital yet, but has done everything but this Poison Castle now
[1:14:59] <%Archmortal> Capra moment for sure
[1:15:01] <ebrion> "Over Leveled"
[1:15:01] <%RealThiele> happy womens day
[1:15:14] <$Solid_Stro> Well played clerks sabert14Smug
[1:15:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> who's worried about that?
[1:15:21] <bluefootedtpeack> int/sorcery is weirdly lacking in the mid game,  carian slicer outdamages everything until you get the kamehameha.
[1:15:23] <HystericalCH> if a capra demon gave you super mushroom aids
[1:15:26] <%Valdorick> There is no over level, only High damage out, and high damage in
[1:15:29] <%twistedj3ster> I was never worried
[1:15:35] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Will you be streaming the Int build, or is that all going to be off-camera?
[1:15:35] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> That's a saving grace
[1:15:36] <%Cozy90> Cozy90 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 24 months, currently on a 8 month streak! Hi pat! :)
[1:15:41] <%Pookiedaexzile> Life Bar so long  The Lakers trying to draft it
[1:15:47] <%notsoy> yeah i don't think any dark souls game actually enables you to totally trivialize incoming damage
[1:15:47] <+TAFK> he smell
[1:15:56] <tanarath> Pat understands that you have the choese.
[1:16:04] <tanarath> Sorry, zangief*
[1:16:14] <%amused_platypus> you got a sward
[1:16:15] <ohno58> Stranger of paradise is next right?
[1:16:20] <%Cjjb1995> here's hoping it has dlc!
[1:16:22] <ExpressNode> My dog always tries to steal from my plate. I used to give her food but then stopped.
[1:16:24] <%chiazam> "exhausted of streaming Elden Ring"
[1:16:27] <+machshop> paige's pants
[1:16:28] <%Valdorick> But will Elden Ring become the new Dark Souls 3 LP? You know, 'nothing good is out now, let's just play my comfort game'?
[1:16:30] <%king_wragles> king_wragles subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 40 months! With everything I've learned and heard about Elden Ring, I wouldn't be surprised if player characters were randomly determined to be left or right handed
[1:16:30] <mrducksauce> lol
[1:16:36] <jacksawjack> one guy I saw was level 285 NG+1 and still getting wrecked.
[1:16:45] <ohno58> LETS GOOOOO
[1:16:47] <mrducksauce> KILL CHAOS is next week, ugh, what a horrible looking game
[1:16:47] <$OfficerMods> chaos?
[1:16:47] <%JoshManVGH> You should tick a tock sick int build shit.
[1:16:54] <ExpressNode> Things will get chaotic
[1:16:58] <@Ranryu692> are you going to give the Kirby game a shot?
[1:17:00] <@Spydurman> feels doable
[1:17:00] <urkleturtle> i think after elden ring i might just be exhausted of videogames for a while
[1:17:06] <roguemephilesclone> That's a rad knight design.
[1:17:07] <%Valdorick> Oh right, and I missed Triangle Strategy
[1:17:19] <%twistedj3ster> be nice to ladder
[1:17:23] <ohno58> @mrducksauce That game looks great tf are you talking about?
[1:17:25] <%chiazam> Even if I'm not finished with this game I'm switching to SoP, I want that game FRESH
[1:17:28] <@Spydurman> I believe in you
[1:17:36] <%JoshManVGH> Fuck! I forgot about FFO:SoP
[1:17:39] <Saltmeisterr> triangle game is fun
[1:17:47] <ExpressNode> I heard that game from reviewers say its middling but I haven't played it so don't know how true that is
[1:17:58] <roguemephilesclone> You are such a Dark Souls character right now.
[1:18:17] <penitentpendant> Defeat Elemer Fudd!
[1:18:23] <%JoshManVGH> @expressnode CHAOS or Triangle?

[1:19:03] <Ravioli_Ronin> Oh shit this guy rocked me at the church of vows

[1:19:06] <lethallylactic> LUL
[1:19:06] <%Nobrev> wait is the the bell bearing hunter but not a phantom
[1:19:13] <%Archmortal> I love that he still almost kicked your ass
[1:19:18] <LMTTN> Would it be a spoiler to ask if you got the clone summon?
[1:19:23] <+livi242> his sword is broken but it staggers really easily
[1:19:25] <bluefootedtpeack> go to the boss weapon vendor at the roundtable for his armor
[1:19:26] <ohno58> >lvl 152
[1:19:27] <%chiazam> oh this one doesn't work?
[1:19:31] <Saltmeisterr> @ExpressNode the game has been doing surprisingly well critcally, 83 on MC and 500,000 copies sold week on release
[1:19:32] <@Spydurman> @LMTTN he got it

[1:22:09] <%tusk102> yes
[1:22:11] <+Candledark> Whenever I'm leaving my room for an extended time, I look for Pat's stream. Lately, I've been looking for Elden Ring players because those are bound to be long streams too. The nice thing is that this is a Pat AND Elden Ring stream. Ah, now I can go shopping.
[1:22:16] <deviljhojho_> now thats a hat
[1:22:16] <LMTTN> ok thanks for the heads up
[1:22:21] <%tusk102> ehhhh

[1:22:29] <%Agami23> go with the weird tadpole dude head
[1:22:29] <%Archmortal> will the Skeletal Mask hood fit?
[1:22:33] <ExpressNode> @saltmeisterr Guess I will pick it up. Gives me a reason to turn on my switch which I haven't touched in months

[1:22:41] <Augus7717> how do you get the wolf head? @PatStaresAt
[1:22:50] <penitentpendant> I kind of hope there is one, and only one, mimic in this game just to mess with people
[1:22:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt If you have an open talisman slot, beat megajars knights for the ultimate equip load charm
[1:22:58] <olgafl0w> just use the aliem head Kappa

[1:24:24] <%Nobrev> there's a couple somber 8's in rot lake if you haven't gotten those yet
[1:24:28] <%tusk102> its weird how pat has done both more and less than me

[1:24:36] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Fyi you are not going to be able to finish the volcano manor quest until you visit the capitol
[1:24:46] <+extantCadence> There's no +9 in lake of rot that I know of
[1:24:49] <+alphonseisbest> God Elden rings ui/UX SUCKS good game tho

[1:26:01] <oda_flobunaga> EZ
[1:26:04] <deviljhojho_> who the fuck is godefroy
[1:26:07] <lethallylactic> But with a different name
[1:26:08] <Saltmeisterr> wut
[1:26:09] <eleskei> lol they straight up named him fucking godefroy
[1:26:11] <it_came_from_outer_space> Hmmmm, this is kind of lame imo
[1:26:11] <Ghufufin> you cant hope to match him in a contest of arms
[1:26:14] <%Wallabri> that's a lotta limbs
[1:26:14] <lyzejag> Who ?
[1:26:15] <digaogrunge> GODEFROY?
[1:26:19] <+bytex678> Someone misspelled Godfrey
[1:26:20] <HeroToxiko> isn't geoffrey just a tiny torso?
[1:26:21] <deviljhojho_> no idea!
[1:26:31] <@Spydurman> you can jump that ground smash
[1:26:31] <Ravioli_Ronin> You’ve gotta be shitting me LUL
[1:26:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Godric the GrafDAD
[1:26:33] <%Valdorick> Nah, its his brother. He failed attacking the capital.
[1:26:40] <Sunstalker> Oh, you found him pretty late, huh
[1:26:40] <%luftraumm1> as far as lore goes blackflame should be good on him
[1:26:40] <saraizarai> I wonder how many dicks does this dude have
[1:26:41] <%Mister_McDerp> papa godefroy
[1:26:43] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> You can jump those
[1:26:45] <%chiazam> It occurs to me that I HAVE NO IDEA what the Evergoal's are
[1:26:53] <Sunstalker> His rewards pretty good for your lightning spear.
[1:26:57] <@QueequegTheater> @saraizarai Zero, he replaced his with another arm
[1:26:59] <Willowight> literal dq9 enemy reskinning
[1:27:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @chiazam Prisons
[1:27:01] <bluefootedtpeack> love how they ran out of god names with godwyn,godrick and godfrey so now it's just godefroy
[1:27:02] <urkleturtle> doesn't even get the dragon phase, so way easier
[1:27:05] <jacksawjack> No dragons around to help you bitch
[1:27:05] <jbrachob> REMIX
[1:27:07] <HeroToxiko> @chiazam turbo hell
[1:27:09] <terrible35> @chiazam forever jails
[1:27:13] <%Cjjb1995> interesting if you're right, I was under the impression Godrick only looked that way because he just grafted that shit onto himself
[1:27:13] <tanarath> UNGA
[1:27:15] <Saltmeisterr> ok these name are getting ridiculous
[1:27:22] <%KngJester> homie said he built different
[1:27:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @chiazam From my best guess, there's rifts used as prisons for particularly powerful people.
[1:27:27] <penitentpendant> @chiazam They're implied prisons. Since people have a habit of being immortal, eternal jail is the next best solution to murder
[1:27:28] <%TheGuesty> wow 50 per tick
[1:27:32] <%Mister_McDerp> based on the name an evergaol is a jail that is forever
[1:27:36] <%luftraumm1> !!!
[1:27:43] <jeppeww> this game really has too many dudes with the same name
[1:27:44] <%greasypete00> [you are not immune to scarlet rot]
[1:27:47] <%Valdorick> Gywn WEEPS at the names of the Erdtree era
[1:27:48] <deviljhojho_> so are we gonna get an explanation for that?
[1:27:50] <NewWillinium> . .Can enemies be effected by Frenzy/Madness
[1:27:52] <it_came_from_outer_space> First reuse I really don't like tbh
[1:27:57] <jacksawjack> The eletric dragon is also nearby the fields of fulgurblooms
[1:28:00] <oda_flobunaga> Grafdad, get ded
[1:28:02] <urkleturtle> talisman
[1:28:02] <HystericalCH> talisman
[1:28:07] <digaogrunge> OTIC BLAST
[1:28:09] <+bytex678> I wonder when Choderoy comes along
[1:28:26] <%Cjjb1995> if you click on the left thumbstick you can sort by how recently you acquired your items
[1:28:34] <%chiazam> BY HOW MUCH
[1:28:37] <@QueequegTheater> I'm certain that using the frenzy spell explicitly mentioned to cause madness can only go well Kappa
[1:28:48] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> This one is pretty good
[1:28:50] <deviljhojho_> thats not bad
[1:28:57] <+bytex678> number go up
[1:28:59] <%tusk102> thats p good
[1:29:00] <@QueequegTheater> 68
[1:29:01] <johndoe0920> 20ish
[1:29:08] <jeppeww> ~20-25 right?
[1:29:08] <%tusk102> more than 5
[1:29:11] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> 70 plus damage
[1:29:14] <@QueequegTheater> 15-18%
[1:29:26] <penitentpendant> 452 to 520. Is around 15%
[1:29:39] <%RealThiele> yea 15%
[1:29:41] <%Glass_Muffin> what's y'alls favorite boss fight so far?
[1:29:53] <%fat_burtreynolds> Sorry what happened? I got distracted by the us marines using anime girls as their new recruiting tactic
[1:29:56] <HystericalCH> charged sorceries OR skills
[1:30:00] <urkleturtle> my favorite is a spoiler
[1:30:02] <deviljhojho_> heartbreaking
[1:30:09] <oda_flobunaga> Milenia or Radahn
[1:30:11] <penitentpendant> @Glass_Muffin As gimmicky as it is, "Normandy Beach vs Radahn"
[1:30:14] <%chiazam> embarrasing
[1:30:18] <%Bluwizard21> lookin at the boss fights, godricks line seems to be a bunch of bitches compared to Radagons
[1:30:23] <saraizarai> Radahn for the sheer cool factor
[1:30:25] <%Glass_Muffin> I think radhan was so fuckin cool
[1:30:26] <%tusk102> lol. lmao.
[1:30:30] <%RealThiele> to the right of the starcase theres cool stuff
[1:30:36] <+machshop> hehehe
[1:30:37] <fishmonger555> that briar armor is COOL AS HECK
[1:30:39] <Dabrikishaw> @Glass_Muffin So far I think I like Rennala the most from a storytelling perspective.
[1:30:40] <signofzeta> @Glass_Muffin all of the shardbearers are winners in my book
[1:30:43] <%Glass_Muffin> also much easier to do solo using npc summons vs with multiplayer imo
[1:30:43] <bxdragon> Me smile
[1:30:44] <+MarkoTolstov> So we have Godwyn, Godfrey, Godrick and now Godefroy? And Godefroy was an Elden Lord like Godfrey was? This is so confusing LUL
[1:30:45] <radiorosewater> Margit seems cool
[1:30:48] <bluefootedtpeack> visually the boss of gelmir is my fave,
[1:30:48] <penitentpendant> @Glass_Muffin I love the music cuts out when he does the jump attack
[1:30:53] <%Sirtimbob> Cheer500 Pat, im way behind on vids and gameplay. You said on the podcast something that enhances shield blocking to the point of bosses not making you lose stamina. Can you explain that real quick?
[1:30:58] <%Cjjb1995> it's neveer not cool to jump off torrent and attack
[1:30:59] <rommlll> how the pat doing
[1:31:02] <jacksawjack> There's a dragon tree sentenal knight at the city's north entrance that gives a big weapon and a BIG shied.
[1:31:11] <+bytex678> I wonder if the next will be Geoffrey
[1:31:13] <PenguinPall> boss on the right of the gate
[1:31:19] <+alphonseisbest> HOLY SHIT THAT BLuud slash art is BROKEN
[1:31:20] <%Archmortal> they know the POWER of pocket sand
[1:31:22] <Minorou> @MarkoTolstov not much different than Gwyn, Gwynevere, Gwyndolin
[1:31:29] <%Glass_Muffin> @sirtimbob you can get the skill he has now on his shelf. once you activate it you don't lose any stamina on block
[1:31:34] <%Glass_Muffin> shield*
[1:31:42] <+alphonseisbest> It's like double the length of any sword omfg
[1:31:56] <HystericalCH> Geoff is a pretty mundane name for god-king of the world
[1:31:56] <HeroToxiko> gravaga gaang
[1:32:00] <it_came_from_outer_space> "gravity shithole" also known as a cratr
[1:32:02] <rommlll> fuck clipping
[1:32:03] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Boss to the right and a dungeon to the left
[1:32:04] <it_came_from_outer_space> *Crater
[1:32:06] <+KipTheSmuggler> what level is pat now
[1:32:09] <radiorosewater> PAT ALL HUMANS HAVE GRAVITY
[1:32:11] <%Cozy90> the gravity goons
[1:32:11] <+RedMaskBandit> I'm finally close to your playtime with 83 hrs
[1:32:25] <+MarkoTolstov> @minorou honestly not really? Gwyn is daddy and self centred, making his kids named the same. This is all unrelated (???) people named similar
[1:32:29] <saraizarai> oh shit this fuck
[1:32:33] <penitentpendant> Alien Time!
[1:32:35] <+KipTheSmuggler> damn 152 and his stamina bar that small?

[1:32:43] <%TheGuesty> beetle bull!
[1:32:44] <BYAKURENLOVER763> BULL BUG!!!!!!!
[1:32:45] <lethallylactic> This guy got no eyeball tho
[1:32:47] <+RedMaskBandit> my time is inflated because I sometimes over do it on the herb
[1:32:48] <HeroToxiko> low roar starts playing
[1:32:50] <%BlueLunecy> Dog
[1:32:51] <bluefootedtpeack> this one doesn't have the eye in the middle
[1:32:53] <+Aokaay> i hate these bosses so much
[1:32:56] <saraizarai> that is so busted
[1:32:57] <rommlll> yoooo
[1:32:57] <+Fenrisulfr_V> This one doesn't have a skull, weird.

[1:33:02] <%Mister_McDerp> ANT LION
[1:33:02] <HeroToxiko> gravity centipede
[1:33:05] <jacksawjack> Beetlebull
[1:33:07] <+machshop> could this be a dog?
[1:33:09] <Minorou> @MarkoTolstov they're all direct great-grandparent-to-grandparent-to-parent-to-son relation
[1:33:31] <+thickshield> power level may be an understatement
[1:33:31] <%twohitgood> This guy gave Max problems.
[1:33:34] <%chiazam> Pat its an aoe on the ground lmao
[1:33:34] <jacksawjack> @machshop That's Pope Turtle
[1:33:35] <%Cozy90> this guys weapon is pretty lit
[1:33:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> Bewary of dog
[1:33:37] <+KipTheSmuggler> oof
[1:33:37] <TwistParabola> F
[1:33:38] <%tusk102> could this be dog
[1:33:39] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Space dog
[1:33:46] <johndoe0920> 'MURICA
[1:33:46] <%twistedj3ster> Maybe a horsie boss?
[1:33:47] <42nfl19> wait @PatStaresAt has a poison dragon now?
[1:33:48] <@QueequegTheater> Level 152 btw

[1:33:51] <%Felhad> Behold, dog
[1:33:52] <Oath_Othelio> Wait Pat is level 152 what the FUCK lmao
[1:33:52] <%Archmortal> does the rock body count as a shell because according to the message system all dogs have shells
[1:33:56] <%Glass_Muffin> Glass_Muffin subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! let's GOOOO 5 MONTHS.
[1:33:57] <%tetraes> the idea of Stars being freakbeasts is super cool to me for some reason
[1:33:58] <@QueequegTheater> KKona
[1:33:58] <+yungkame> dog ahead
[1:33:59] <penitentpendant> Gief: "How dare you not feed me! I'll starve!"
[1:34:02] <%Brassnarwhal> what's pat's vigor up to now?
[1:34:09] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal 40
[1:34:10] <%twistedj3ster> ok nvm
[1:34:14] <%chiazam> nah
[1:34:20] <rommlll> can we keep it mom
[1:34:23] <Sunstalker> Man, the sentinel shield just clowned on godskin for me. just reflect his fireballs back ez pz
[1:34:24] <TwistParabola> IMO this guy is worse on horseback
[1:34:24] <LMTTN> I have a Rot summon but it jumps around like crazy and doesn't meet its target often
[1:34:26] <thefishofwar> i love having beaten the game and joining stream like "there's a boss there??"
[1:34:31] <eleskei> he whips his hair back and forth
[1:34:37] <PenguinPall> These things are so agressive
[1:34:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> I think its clever how they reused soem sekero assets
[1:34:52] <Oath_Othelio> That had to be some *hardcore* farming to get to 152 at where I assume pat is rn
[1:34:54] <urkleturtle> yeah these guys suck butt
[1:35:08] <tri3dgE027> This guy seem easier in a more open area compared to the one in the Caverns
[1:35:11] <%fat_burtreynolds> This monster is totally the best thing to guard your Amazon boxes when your not at home
[1:35:13] <Sunstalker> Is this Pat's first fight with one of these? D:
[1:35:14] <penitentpendant> TBF, it's coming from below so blocking forward with a shield would be weird
[1:35:17] <rommlll> so gravity monsters comes from outer space... space souls confirmed
[1:35:18] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @Oath_Othelio There's an end-game zone that nets 5 million an hour.
[1:35:18] <jacksawjack> I wonder how much bitching Plague is gonna do?
[1:35:28] <+KipTheSmuggler> u need piercing damage against this guy
[1:35:32] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater that's a lotta health
[1:35:34] <Alrom> I got my ass kicked so many times by these things that I now enjoy fighting them
[1:35:42] <%tusk102> GRAB

[1:35:55] <Ghufufin> tiche time?
[1:35:56] <eleskei> a painful hugho
[1:35:58] <Oath_Othelio> @Oath_Othelio I know but he's in the Altus fields right now fighting this dude, and didn't seem to recognize it so that means he most likely hasn't gone to another area
[1:35:58] <johndoe0920> This is what Radahn is protecting us from.
[1:35:59] <Ghufufin> f
[1:35:59] <%Archmortal> I love this dog
[1:35:59] <%chiazam> Try summoning
[1:36:00] <%Nobrev> might need to call in the tiche
[1:36:01] <%Mister_McDerp> SICK
[1:36:02] <+bytex678> Can we cut tails?
[1:36:03] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal Not as much as I had at around his level
[1:36:04] <Sunstalker> There's at least two more of these assholes.
[1:36:08] <%sporeian94> Pat I'm ordering Chinese Food what should I order
[1:36:22] <%fat_burtreynolds> What a cool Monster hunter
[1:36:23] <$OfficerMods> Now if its a really tough stamina you will still lose stamina
[1:36:29] <$OfficerMods> really tough boss i mean
[1:36:33] <rommlll> look at that loser just staring at the boss
[1:36:36] <eleskei> u can do it pat!!!
[1:36:40] <%Sirtimbob> THANKS PAT
[1:36:42] <%tusk102> 0 stamina loss
[1:36:46] <%maskofmichael> Order Pizza instead
[1:36:47] <%Archmortal> Barricade adds 35 Guard Boost, if a shield has 65 or more base, it lets you hit 100, at 100 guard boost you lose no stamina
[1:36:54] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater i got all the way to the volcano with like less than 20 vigor, i beat the fat godskin apostle with about 20
[1:36:56] <HystericalCH> what the hell is pineapple chicken? sweet and sour?
[1:36:57] <jacksawjack> Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Uppercut Tiger Tiger Tiger Knee Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Tiger Genocide.
[1:37:00] <$OfficerMods> GRABBED
[1:37:03] <%Archmortal> this was possible in old dark souls games as well
[1:37:04] <%luftraumm1> clickity clack
[1:37:07] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal why torture yourself like that
[1:37:10] <eleskei> a bug hug
[1:37:11] <%sporeian94> @maskofmichael  I already had Pizza this week, I'm sick of it
[1:37:11] <%chiazam> I'm really suprised Pat doesn't just immediately summon
[1:37:12] <@Fuggins4U> @sporeian94 general tao, rice, hunan dumplings, and hot & sour soup. beef and broccoli is good too
[1:37:16] <%fat_burtreynolds> Orange chicken and almond crisp shramp
[1:37:16] <$OfficerMods> dabbed on
[1:37:18] <%RealThiele> Vored
[1:37:22] <%Valdorick> Shadows Die Twice
[1:37:25] <%Mister_McDerp> general tso's for life
[1:37:25] <%Cozy90> this is one of the bosses im not fond of
[1:37:26] <%Bluwizard21> There really isn't such a thing as overpowered in this game
[1:37:27] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is this guy to fast to be a mount fight?
[1:37:31] <Ravioli_Ronin> YOU DONT HAVE THE RIGHT
[1:37:31] <%tusk102> maybe pat should stop *staring* at the boss and start beating it Kappa
[1:37:33] <$OfficerMods> post round hits are legal
[1:37:34] <@QueequegTheater> He's killed you 3 times
[1:37:35] <AthenaAegis> Gief when he wants his toy or food Kappa
[1:37:35] <+agrocraig01> kung pow chicken
[1:37:36] <%Archmortal> wasn't that the third time
[1:37:37] <%maskofmichael> @sporeian94 Sick of Pizza? That's a lie.
[1:37:37] <Oath_Othelio> @Brassnarwhal First off, the Godskin people were tools, second off, my GOD health is so much more important in elden ring than the previous games
[1:37:40] <oda_flobunaga> Chinese food is just Lasagna right?
[1:37:47] <%RealThiele> very torrent friendly
[1:37:50] <rommlll> sheep onyx beetle gravity bull
[1:37:55] <Sunstalker> No summons you want to pull out, Pat? And yeah, he's easier mounted but your dmg goes low for most builds.
[1:37:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> he has OTGs
[1:38:03] <$OfficerMods> MY OWN CLONE
[1:38:04] <penitentpendant> Greg Summoning Time!
[1:38:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater i was unaware of the vigor meta i was building like i did in ds1, i beat ds1 with 15 in my health stat lol
[1:38:05] <%chiazam> YEAH I'VE BEEN SAYING
[1:38:07] <%gag5y> Now neither of us will be virgins!
[1:38:07] <rommlll> the power of friends
[1:38:12] <%twistedj3ster> look at himn help!
[1:38:13] <Dopamien> 'help' you lol
[1:38:14] <Dabrikishaw> @Brassnarwhal Yeah is is. I gotta get my Vigor past 25 soon
[1:38:14] <%chiazam> too many mechanics
[1:38:15] <@QueequegTheater> @Brassnarwhal If you think Godskin Noble is a tool, you haven't fought the real one
[1:38:15] <42nfl19> oh fuck shadow clone
[1:38:16] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Isn't this the flaming bull from Sekiro's charge?
[1:38:22] <Sunstalker> White spots are weaker to dmg but good luck hitting those with shorter weapons
[1:38:24] <%tusk102> wow hes puttin in work
[1:38:25] <%TheGuesty> Mimic has all kinds of cohones!
[1:38:27] <42nfl19> How does shadow clone compare to Oleg?
[1:38:32] <jacksawjack> boiled prawn man is nearby and sells boiled crab for the same price and it greatly reduces Phys. Dam. taken.
[1:38:33] <+alphonseisbest> hey pat when u have a sec could u show on the map where u got the Lightning spell? running faith and cant seem to find it
[1:38:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @oath_othelio oh yeah that fight specifically was absolute scum, on steam he has a 3 percent clear rate, or he did when i beat him
[1:38:38] <%maskofmichael> He looks like a really bad tooth
[1:38:46] <nesbitt22> Hey its Greg
[1:38:46] <%RealThiele> my buddy and meeee
[1:38:48] <eleskei> hes weirdly cute maybe its bc his head is so big
[1:38:53] <CheezeWolf> maiyadClap
[1:38:53] <%twistedj3ster> get him more attractive Pat!
[1:38:56] <penitentpendant> @42nfl19 Better, it scales with your own stats so it gets stronger the stronger you are
[1:38:57] <Oath_Othelio> @Brassnarwhal Oh I've beaten the game so I've fought all of their boss fights. Tubby was annoying, but the later duo is the bastard
[1:38:58] <rommlll> power of friendship wins
[1:38:59] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal The one in the tower? Yeah, the sentinel shields' spell counter makes it very simple
[1:39:06] <HystericalCH> @alphonseisbest fextralife it
[1:39:06] <%Brassnarwhal> @queequegtheater the other guy said it not me lol, but i was annoyed by the fat apostle in the volcano for a good while
[1:39:08] <@QueequegTheater> I retweeted a meme someone made of Mimic Tear as armstrong and the elden ring bosses as Raiden
[1:39:09] <42nfl19> @penitentpendant god damn that is cool
[1:39:10] <%chiazam> worth it
[1:39:13] <Emerald_Emperor> i mean i like fighting them
[1:39:16] <urkleturtle> you did it for the exposure
[1:39:21] <%Archmortal> It was extremely worth seeing those THREE deaths
[1:39:26] <@Spydurman> isn't 11K what you get from that bird trick?
[1:39:30] <@QueequegTheater> Reminder that Mimic is ALSO immune to rot
[1:39:33] <jacksawjack> dungeon ahead
[1:39:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker imttalking about the one in the volcano in the church of eigly or whatever
[1:39:48] <Oath_Othelio> @Brassnarwhal Some of the bosses have super low clear rates
[1:39:56] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @QueequegTheater Also immune to bleed/poison.

[1:40:17] <rommlll> sussy tunny
[1:40:19] <%tusk102> it said perfumers so i assume poison time

[1:40:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @oath_othelio i can understand why the fat apostle does, rot dragon really carried me through it, his roll attack is pure suffering, it o eshot me every time it hit me and his ass was so fat that i couldnt roll through it i had to avoid the entire landing area

[1:41:17] <@QueequegTheater> @MoustacheCEO It's fun bringing them out for everything and absolutely murderfucking bosses
[1:41:18] <%JoshManVGH> Pat seems to have a preternatural sense on where the From designers hid all their shit.
[1:41:19] <%RealThiele> yea fire staggers the plants
[1:41:27] <penitentpendant> He has Esuna, he's fine

[1:41:38] <Sunstalker> Pat, neat trick for these dumb plants. Craft some of those firepots that leave fire patches behind. Just chuck them and do other stuff
[1:41:39] <%Cozy90> THAST HOT
[1:41:41] <TwistParabola> Pat confirmed to be toxic

[1:41:42] <%tusk102> poison, from the can in my hand

[1:41:46] <%abakkus> hmmmm
[1:41:46] <rommlll> *only if you want it*
[1:41:51] <Oath_Othelio> @Brassnarwhal Yeah, godskin bastards for sure
[1:41:52] <+Fenrisulfr_V> @MoustacheCEO I beat one of the "problem" bosses second try because of Mimic Tear and didn't get why everyone was complaining about it.

[1:42:49] <%notsoy> tree of chaos
[1:42:50] <Oath_Othelio> @QueequegTheater I love Lobos, he's INSANE he's not normal for how he's able to so calmly just go "oh yeah that's why I died" after 800 attempts, and then hit another
[1:42:53] <BYAKURENLOVER763> what armor is that he's wearing?
[1:42:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I hope you fight a bucket of apples

[1:43:31] <@QueequegTheater> @QueequegTheater The dude stinger-spammed his way through the entire DMC franchise
[1:43:35] <rommlll> some kind of skeleton gravity moth
[1:43:37] <%Brassnarwhal> holy shit thats so cool
[1:43:44] <Midnight188> the final boss is clearly Miyazaki himself telling you there will never be a PC release of Bloodbourne
[1:43:52] <NewWillinium> . . *Where are you*? I thought I had done all of Altus

[1:45:17] <MoustacheCEO> Omenkiller fucked me up in my game what do you mean he's in a duo fight?
[1:45:21] <Oath_Othelio> I've found most of the map, but I don't even know if I have found ALL of the map it's so fucking huge

[1:46:00] <%Pookiedaexzile> Omen Killer what is this Xbox Live in 2005

[1:46:07] <%Dakuu75> I remember seeing Pat fight a boss that was 3 of those tall, blue, crystal ladies but, I can't remember where. Anyone know?
[1:46:07] <%Valdorick> Now you can Super Power Stance it
[1:46:10] <rommlll> why plants hate fire
[1:46:14] <%xcompleasedad> plants burning, huh?
[1:46:16] <PunkZedB> I hate fire too, honestly. Just not a big fan of being on fire

[1:46:17] <dan_g_v> butt cheeks grip for the third one
[1:46:19] <%Brassnarwhal> i wanna see you do a 3 sword style with it pat
[1:46:21] <urkleturtle> almost as much as rats hate water
[1:46:22] <+Fenrisulfr_V> Oh, that's why they're called Omenkillers. I never read the weapon before.
[1:46:26] <LMTTN> The sheer enormity of this game makes me worry I may never finish it but I'll certainly never get bored it
[1:46:31] <DusK_The_Stray> Put the third one in your mouth
[1:46:34] <Sunstalker> @Dakuu75 hidden wall behind chonky sorceror above plgaue church above selia
[1:46:34] <%Valdorick> @Dakuu75 The cave being the Sullen Graveyard?
[1:46:39] <jacksawjack> There's a Foreskin Apostal to the north and you get his weapon and a double handed black fire combustion

[1:48:04] <%radiorosewater> @toastchi Thanks my dude!
[1:48:09] <Oath_Othelio> This right here was my NUMBER ONE complaint about Elden Ring. The amount of reused boss encounters. Especially when they're thrown into a duo fight
[1:48:11] <%Brassnarwhal> if you only kill one then die they respawn you have to kill both
[1:48:14] <%JoshManVGH> I'm so glad the door was open for this fight.

[1:48:43] <Augus7717> oof
[1:48:43] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt there's a grace right past them. might be a more convinient starting point
[1:48:46] <BYAKURENLOVER763> they do
[1:48:47] <42nfl19> Is it possible to kill the Horse? or is that thing just basically ONE unit?
[1:48:49] <%cade_calrayn> NOPE!
[1:48:49] <+crocodile_t34rz> nope
[1:48:52] <rommlll> *hopes both alive*
[1:48:54] <%cade_calrayn> it's bullshit
[1:48:54] <Augus7717> hurts all the more because there is a grace right behind them LUL
[1:49:00] <BenLaaNN> you can only pull 1 with a ranged attack
[1:49:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @pats@patstaresat did you find the village that caught the dancing plague in the north of altus plateaunope
[1:49:08] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[1:49:08] <sirrice77> On tree sentinel the horse is just part of the boss i think
[1:49:10] <%MaybeFalco> you can also aggro them one at time too, which is weird
[1:49:11] <%radiorosewater> very alive
[1:49:14] <Jace_Keats> They legit put two of them there just so you have to fight at least one legit
[1:49:16] <$OfficerMods> Its bigger than it looks

[1:49:56] <tanarath> creepy49Porpkek
[1:49:56] <LMTTN> I saw a video of someone putting rot on them and getting far enough away for them to return to their spawn position
[1:49:56] <Sunstalker> You can ride around to the other gate to skip these two if wanted
[1:49:57] <%RealThiele> it sure is
[1:49:58] <+KipTheSmuggler> damn pat has barely even seen the map
[1:49:59] <TwistParabola> lol. lmao

[1:50:25] <Dopamien> LMAO
[1:50:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @dakuu75 might be my favorite little spot in the game, and i really like the hammer you find there
[1:50:26] <Dabrikishaw> @tizziks 5 years of dev time is the only answer we can guess
[1:50:26] <%luftraumm1> READ

[1:50:50] <eleskei> city for giants
[1:50:51] <+Fenrisulfr_V> It's actually crazy. The map itself is much smaller than other open world games, but it's so much /denser/ that it feels colossal.
[1:50:52] <DusK_The_Stray> The other one is deaf

[1:55:17] <$Solid_Stro> sabert14Smug
[1:55:18] <$CyrusBain> Just came back. Did he read donations?
[1:55:18] <%boggsz12> if someone does that i hope he just says 'no'
[1:55:20] <penitentpendant> George is good at storytelling and not writing Game of Thrones. It's his favorite hobby!
[1:55:21] <%Cjjb1995> I've seen videos of him answering lore stuff at cons :/
[1:55:23] <HystericalCH> george couldn't give less of a shit about elden ring's lore
[1:55:24] <Alrom> Devs really like this enemy
[1:55:26] <jacksawjack> Tree Penis
[1:55:26] <@QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt I want to read the short story he wrote for this game
[1:55:28] <TwistParabola> lmao
[1:55:28] <%fat_burtreynolds> He’s playing horizon forbidden west rinnow
[1:55:30] <TheBlankAce> Big dog
[1:55:33] <%JoshManVGH> I'm sad everytime I see one of these...
[1:55:34] <%RealThiele> surprise!
[1:55:36] <dan_g_v> regular enemy now
[1:55:36] <+crocodile_t34rz> That ugly bastard shows up so many times
[1:55:41] <@QueequegTheater> Oh, speaking of reused bosses
[1:55:45] <%Felhad> Also yeah. GRRM wrote the history, everything happening presently is Miyazaki
[1:55:45] <%Agami23> honestly, this games story is way easier to follow than past souls games
[1:55:46] <%solracc25> How bout that book? how's it coming GRRM?
[1:56:04] <Sunstalker> I can't use the golden seed the putrid one of these dropped because flasks are maxed LUL
[1:56:17] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I walk away and come back to pat fighting a tree
[1:56:18] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt So now that there is a day and night cycle, does that mean you scrub areas twice?
[1:56:20] <+ScrapKingKeita> Do you know about the immolation trick with the Erdtree Greatshield?
[1:56:23] <jacksawjack> CHEST
[1:56:27] <primarch_lupercal> are these guys like screwed up erdtree babies
[1:56:29] <%Sirtimbob> He better drop 2 olegs
[1:56:32] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I still think this enemy is poorly designed. Shares the same problems as the Pus of Man from DS3.
[1:56:32] <jacksawjack> WAGON
[1:56:38] <%maskofmichael> Finishing Game Of Thrones is the Main  Quest, George R. R. Martin is just trying to do all the side quest first
[1:56:39] <penitentpendant> @Sunstalker What was your starting gift?
[1:56:45] <+crocodile_t34rz> Get the chest for Ultimate Bonk!
[1:56:49] <jacksawjack> LOOT!!!

[1:57:00] <%echobee_tv> Easy S Scaling too
[1:57:01] <%Valdorick> MAN IS WEAK
[1:57:03] <%ScreamLord> Marotte's weapon
[1:57:06] <%Cjjb1995> I'm not complaining though!
[1:57:09] <jacksawjack> The Toe Crusher
[1:57:14] <@QueequegTheater> YOU ARE TOO WEAK
[1:57:15] <Sunstalker> @penitentpendant The seed. I know that's why, just funny you're out of flasks to earn by that point
[1:57:19] <LMTTN> Is 60 STR the softcap?
[1:57:19] <HystericalCH> The Bonker
[1:57:22] <+crocodile_t34rz> And it uses regular stones
[1:57:26] <%Mister_McDerp> always wars against giants in these games, why do people hate giants so much?
[1:57:27] <%JoshManVGH> Unga-est of Bungas
[1:57:33] <%echobee_tv> The heavy attack is the artorias flip but with a hammer
[1:57:39] <%sporeian94> pat you should check the other entrance to the royal capital for a cool surprise
[1:57:46] <%abakkus> a little babby one
[1:57:47] <%ScreamLord> It's a young one
[1:57:50] <HystericalCH> @LMTTN 60 is softcap 80 hardcap
[1:57:57] <42nfl19> who is the dead guy?
[1:58:00] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> Singing poo boss is next Pog
[1:58:01] <jubejube56> There are minor erdtrees still growing?! Nature is healing
[1:58:01] <%abakkus> surrounded by conspicuous centipedes huh
[1:58:01] <%Niney_Who> No it's an Incantation
[1:58:03] <penitentpendant> Is it a catalyst?
[1:58:04] <jacksawjack> D's Faction
[1:58:07] <Sunstalker> Hey, Pat. This entire zone between the lift and the capital? FULL of lightning and faith spells.
[1:58:09] <TwistParabola> it's a seal
[1:58:10] <%RealThiele> Bug, O Bug
[1:58:10] <jimbop444> @maskofmichael you just won chat today it's offical
[1:58:11] <Shockmaster182> No maidens?
[1:58:15] <%Felhad> NOBODY expects the Minor Erdtree Inquisition!
[1:58:19] <LMTTN> @LMTTN ok cool thanks
[1:58:22] <$OfficerMods> NERD SEAL
[1:58:26] <$OfficerMods> FOR SPELL CASTING NERDS
[1:58:31] <%JoshManVGH> ALL MAGIC ALL TIME
[1:58:39] <HystericalCH> for sword of night and flame builds
[1:58:41] <%Bluwizard21> in trying to find that boss he was just at I found another cave and boss With an everbloom in it
[1:58:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Perfect for my 60/60 Int/Faith build I plan on doing.
[1:58:45] <Alrom> golden centipedes are always a good sign
[1:58:48] <urkleturtle> a bunch of the golden order spells also need faith and int
[1:58:53] <jacksawjack> I've only found two fundamentilist incants, both sold by D
[1:58:55] <Augus7717> for that hyper powerful 80 int / 80 faith build
[1:58:57] <NewWillinium> There are Hex-Esque spells in the game that need both. They're ALL super weird and neat
[1:58:59] <%Monkeyweed21> For chad true hybrid builds
[1:59:03] <jubejube56> okay but why are there always pots at minor erdtrees?
[1:59:08] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> release the flood
[1:59:12] <LMTTN> Is that dragon head rot thing Faith
[1:59:14] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> break the seal
[1:59:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @LMTTN Yeah.
[1:59:26] <%RealThiele> Rot head is Faith and a bit of arcane
[1:59:27] <%Brassnarwhal> @lmttn yes
[1:59:27] <RustyQuarters> I did not agree to give him a second
[1:59:28] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> scarlet rot dragon?
[1:59:30] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaBig psaPeapoh psaPeapoh psaPeapoh
[1:59:33] <Sunstalker> @NewWillinium There's also a lava sorcery that wants INT/Faith iirc
[1:59:34] <%Archmortal> Screw the 150 PvP shit, I'm going past like 350.
[1:59:36] <%fat_burtreynolds> This is so much fun
[1:59:39] <%fat_burtreynolds> I love being here
[1:59:43] <Shockmaster182> Chat, urine charge
[1:59:49] <LMTTN> fuuuuuuu I wanted to go all in on Int but that looks so sick
[1:59:50] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> I found a rapier that did rot and added bleed to it. now it does 400dmg, 50rot, 100bleed
[2:00:16] <penitentpendant> PvP still has been agreed upon level as far as I know. 180 was the last number someone floated at me.
[2:00:21] <penitentpendant> *hasn't
[2:00:30] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Archmortal It's even worse than that. The PvP meta is being pushed to either 100 or 120 by the hardcore guys.
[2:00:34] <HystericalCH> 180 is way too high
[2:00:35] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Those were my Favorite for the LONGEST time. Especially the Second Tier one. Still haven't tried out the Boss one though. Need the Faith for it
[2:00:38] <RustyQuarters> SourPls
[2:00:40] <%Archmortal> ah, so it's the Dark Souls 2 argument all over again
[2:00:58] <LMTTN> 180 would take so long
[2:00:58] <jimbop444> alye
[2:01:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Some of them are worried that 120 is /too high/.
[2:01:07] <$OfficerMods> I just sworded and boarded the whole game with the heaviest armor and shield i could equip and bloodhound gs 37 vig 24 mind 43 end 32 st and 44 dex
[2:01:19] <+The_EL_Destino> what happened to turtle shield?
[2:01:20] <Sunstalker> Hey, I found the self ignore pyromancy. PogChamp Reward for a painting
[2:01:23] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hey chat, does anyone feel the urge to buy aot merch since it’s ending this yeer
[2:01:27] <LMTTN> I do feel like I level slower here than previous Souls games but I haven't played one in a few years
[2:01:30] <$OfficerMods> that final boss i had to try for hours but got it eventually
[2:01:34] <@QueequegTheater> @fat_burtreynolds no
[2:01:43] <HystericalCH> turtle shield you find really early on, in weeping peninsula
[2:01:46] <@QueequegTheater> But I also just don't get buying merch at all
[2:01:51] <NewWillinium> @Sunstalker Wait the Paintings do something?
[2:02:15] <Sunstalker> @Sunstalker Yeah, find their spots they were painted at and get rewards. It's always on a cliff somewhere
[2:02:17] <$OfficerMods> i like buying merch with practical use, like i got the guilty gear may sweater
[2:02:18] <%fat_burtreynolds> I was thinking about getting the bluerays just cause. I don’t have the space for cloths or manga atm
[2:02:18] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat is going to fight the stinky boss soon isnt he?
[2:02:20] <$OfficerMods> its a good fucking sweater
[2:02:28] <urkleturtle> leveling at the beginning is indeed really slow, but after a point the game just throws runes at you
[2:02:39] <Oath_Othelio> @QueequegTheater I only like things that are practical, like I did get a moogle mug which I like
[2:02:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @fat_burtreynolds definitely don’t buy those Marley armbands
[2:02:53] <%Bluwizard21> Where was the cave pat went into with the omenkiller and the everblossom boss?
[2:02:53] <NewWillinium> @Sunstalker Ohhhhhhhh. I figured that there were like. . . In-Game Concept art or something you eventually handed in to someone
[2:02:56] <@QueequegTheater> @OfficerMods I'm too, uh, "generous" for like 99% of clothing merch FeelsBadMan
[2:03:28] <deviljhojho_> guys how come all the int increasing headgear looks so fucking stupid
[2:03:30] <deviljhojho_> isnt that ironic
[2:03:41] <calmsoul689> anyone know what ending pat is going to get or has gotten?
[2:03:51] <@QueequegTheater> @calmsoul689 Frenzy I think
[2:03:51] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance blobDance mblissDance
[2:03:52] <jimbop444> pocket proctors
[2:03:53] <%Archmortal> @Fenrisulfr_V God the amount of times that crowd has made PvP metas a mess at launch is hilarious.  They never let go of the Demon's and Dark 1 meta
[2:04:01] <$OfficerMods> pat can get pretty much any ending he wants at this point i think
[2:04:02] <deviljhojho_> he has some options
[2:04:03] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @calmsoul689 I have a good guess which one he'll pick, but I won't talk about it.
[2:04:12] <%fat_burtreynolds> I saw this sick ass scout cloak for sale and while I would fucking love that. I don’t know if I could wear that in public lol
[2:04:16] <NewWillinium> I *think* he's going to go for Ranni's, but I have no idea. Whichever one let's him fight all the bosses.
[2:04:21] <deviljhojho_> he has all the mending runes already?
[2:04:21] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> i hope pat choses the hot ending
[2:04:28] <Sunstalker> @Bluwizard21 Next to staircase on the south gate of capital outskirts
[2:04:35] <HystericalCH> talking about the endings seems risky
[2:04:36] <calmsoul689> heres hoping he gets the waifu ending
[2:04:36] <deviljhojho_> thief
[2:04:43] <LMTTN> Will I know if/when I get locked into a story branch?
[2:04:49] <Ner234> CHICKEN Thief D:
[2:04:51] <jubejube56> doggy can definitely try tho
[2:04:54] <%maskofmichael> Cheer500 A hypothetical. Let's say there's an anime called "XXXX", but it's pronounced "Chi Cross X". Which X would you say is the silent one?
[2:04:58] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hooy pat
[2:04:59] <%Monkeyweed21> What about the sigma ending
[2:05:02] <jubejube56> OH you can talk to melina at that grace
[2:05:02] <+Edrem> there was talk to melina there
[2:05:05] <%Bluwizard21> @Sunstalker ty
[2:05:05] <%Felhad> They all let you fight all the bosses though....
[2:05:05] <jubejube56> does she say anything?
[2:05:07] <%Brassnarwhal> @deviljhojho_ i have a faith build that's in all gold with gold weapon and shield and I'm one of the rock people and i think that the hat from the liurnia boss looks pretty good with the set, sorta egyptian fantasy vibe
[2:05:10] <Evendrag> damn, no level ups?
[2:05:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Fenrisulfr_V Yeah, for sure. I remember DS2's meta being 150 when I was super into it (700 hours worth into it). Then, I took a break, came back, and the meta was 100 all of a sudden.
[2:05:22] <TwistParabola> yeah because its a church
[2:05:31] <+Edrem> Melina starts talking again a lot here
[2:05:42] <jubejube56> I might be crazy but I think I saw that at a different church too
[2:05:43] <Sunstalker> Man, I had her leave me before I found these churches
[2:05:46] <@QueequegTheater> Good ole Mileena
[2:05:50] <%fat_burtreynolds> Wish I had two phones so I could watch pat and Woolie at the same time :(
[2:05:50] <deviljhojho_> @Brassnarwhal hmmm you know that ctually makes sense, when you remove it from the tacky moon themed ensemble
[2:05:53] <Tenebrae94> what is the item description of the golden centipedes @patstaresat?
[2:05:55] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat's gone lets talk about the endings again
[2:06:03] <Khester824> are perfume bottles reusable?
[2:06:17] <@QueequegTheater> @Khester824 They're containers for perfume craftables
[2:06:18] <deviljhojho_> marika is a freak
[2:06:18] <jubejube56> so does she do that at every church then?
[2:06:20] <BYAKURENLOVER763> thats about right yessir
[2:06:21] <%fat_burtreynolds> psaGiefrail psaBork doggo loose?
[2:06:27] <calmsoul689> i don't know about you all, they did a good job in designing the maidens in all souls games so far
[2:06:28] <Ner234> I wish she appeared more often
[2:06:28] <%TheAdMerlin> Shame you can't talk to your Ranni fumo more and fluster her again
[2:06:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @deviljhojho_ yeah i thought it looked god awful in the regular set but if you're going for a flavor of garish already it works
[2:06:34] <@QueequegTheater> @Khester824 So if you have 5 you can make up to 5 perfume items
[2:06:41] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> i hope pat doesnt get the treason ending by accident
[2:06:42] <BYAKURENLOVER763> other way around
[2:06:44] <%ShawnTK_> Merica is dumb
[2:06:49] <deviljhojho_> like have you seen that portrait of her husbnad? real meatslab stuff
[2:06:50] <%Archmortal> no, it's a dog
[2:06:51] <@QueequegTheater> @GreenHerbWhiteSmoke "accident"
[2:06:59] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> LUL
[2:07:01] <%imthewisejanitor> Oh snap, thanks for the gifted sub @toastchi !!
[2:07:04] <%fat_burtreynolds> Can you change horse colors yet?
[2:07:04] <%echobee_tv> psaBig game
[2:07:12] <urkleturtle> this game is indeed too big
[2:07:19] <dan_g_v> beeg?
[2:07:22] <%Brassnarwhal> are sub messages waiting for saying goodbye to the peepo?
[2:07:26] <LMTTN> How the hell have people submitted sub-50 hour times on HowLongToBeat
[2:07:32] <HystericalCH> are you intimidated by the girth?
[2:07:32] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> crabs
[2:07:38] <%luftraumm1> there was a ghost steps over there
[2:07:39] <Sunstalker> Pat, invisible scarab back there
[2:07:46] <urkleturtle> it's gonna be so weird when this game gets a small and focused dlc expansion
[2:08:01] <deviljhojho_> i've heard most gargoyle weapons are fantastic
[2:08:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Isn't it 7 ending?
[2:08:06] <deviljhojho_> huh?
[2:08:06] <%luftraumm1> LUL
[2:08:07] <%imthewisejanitor> Nailed it.
[2:08:08] <%xcompleasedad> LUL
[2:08:08] <%twistedj3ster> LUL
[2:08:10] <algorophobic> Yo pat, has anyone put into words how the fall damage works yet?
[2:08:12] <TwistParabola> lmao
[2:08:15] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> how did you mess that up? isnt that a cut scene?
[2:08:15] <+Akizea> oh boy I can't wait for the capital then if you think this is big lol
[2:08:16] <Ner234> LUL Perfect
[2:08:17] <%MorelK> was not meant to be
[2:08:21] <%Archmortal> there should be a 7th ending but it looks like the content was cut from Nepheli's questline
[2:08:25] <@QueequegTheater> @BallerSwagBro9k There's no acheivement for Age Absolute, it might be cut content
[2:08:29] <%Brassnarwhal> i will be up front and say that part of why i asked is that one of the messages is mine, don't wanna look sneaky or anything

[2:12:24] <%Brassnarwhal> @burntwing all orb ponderers areappreciated here
[2:12:27] <sirrice77> the vulgar militiamen at endgame are legit threatening

[2:13:28] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Isn't it nuts that they don't give you a single hidden wall for like 30 hours and make you think they don't exist?
[2:13:30] <jubejube56> It's not a wait of fp, it's a sign of power
[2:13:43] <%Nekros4442> did pat grab the talisman thst iji sells? That shit carried me

[2:23:40] <Cigwynn> ryngeNani
[2:23:41] <%fat_burtreynolds> RIGHT DOWN THE ROOOOOOAD
[2:23:42] <deviljhojho_> a good change of pace from fucking caelid
[2:23:44] <Cigwynn> 152???
[2:23:51] <%Dakuu75> Right down the road~
[2:23:52] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @Dustwalker44 he is satan :)
[2:23:53] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Dustwalker44 Has not.
[2:23:58] <bluefootedtpeack> @Dustwalker44 waiting until after the questline, so no
[2:23:59] <ExpressNode> Reading contour lines  on this map is hard
[2:23:59] <TwistParabola> yeah he's extremely overleveled
[2:24:00] <LMTTN> Action 152
[2:24:00] <HystericalCH> altus/capital outskirts are my favourite areas in the game
[2:24:03] <jubejube56> this looks very roady
[2:24:12] <+Jeshk0> lol owned
[2:24:17] <+Dustwalker44> Oh good. I wanna see when he tries it.
[2:24:27] <deviljhojho_> altus truly is the most "elden ring" area of elden ring
[2:24:38] <bluefootedtpeack> @Dustwalker44 same, love seeing people react to that fella
[2:24:40] <%JohnAtDawn> This is a long shot I know, but does anyone know which stream Pat beat Radhan in?
[2:24:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Satan is one of the coolest "caster" bosses in the series, imo
[2:24:49] <%Cozy90> for whatever reason the opening of this track reminds me of ecco the dolphin
[2:24:55] <LMTTN> Is it really called Satan
[2:24:57] <jubejube56> Yeah how strong is "strong enough to beat satan" strong anyways?
[2:24:58] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @JohnAtDawn Three streams ago, iirc
[2:25:09] <TwistParabola> he missed a site of grace i think
[2:25:10] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @LMTTN No, but he looks like Satan.
[2:25:17] <%Cozy90> theres a track from ecco that opens the same way
[2:25:19] <LMTTN> oh ok lol
[2:25:19] <%luftraumm1> pat did you ever return to Satan @PatStaresAt
[2:25:22] <HystericalCH> The Lord of Sharkweek is a pretty good satan
[2:25:27] <%Cozy90> a long eerie ambient noise
[2:25:30] <%RealThiele> not hot :(
[2:25:33] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> tentacle rat to the right DansGame
[2:25:36] <Augus7717> the fuck is that
[2:25:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Wait, what the fuck is that
[2:25:42] <jubejube56> Amber Starlight....I don't know if you can use that
[2:25:42] <%twistedj3ster> prolly an FP thing
[2:25:43] <%maskofmichael> the starlight of amber
[2:25:49] <+Edrem> amber starlight is a trap, it's the bad end to ranni's quest
[2:25:49] <%octavian_wolf> I NEVER FOUND THAT
[2:25:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> It's a key item
[2:25:52] <hermitdab> dis game too big
[2:25:53] <jubejube56> It is part of selvius' quest iirc
[2:25:54] <jubejube56> mr dead
[2:25:59] <NewWillinium> Oh! That *was* part of Seluvis's quest
[2:26:02] <hermitdab> i love it but cant handle the girth
[2:26:08] <sothatsprettybrutal> "draft"
[2:26:19] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Oh, Seluvis was dead by the time I would've found this.
[2:26:20] <TwistParabola> thankfully he's dead
[2:26:22] <%crimsonharvest> yes thats draft
[2:26:24] <+Jeshk0> yes
[2:26:25] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[2:26:26] <+Edrem> He tries to puppetize Ranni and shit goes all kinds of wrong because you helped him
[2:26:26] <%greasypete00> yes
[2:26:28] <fatalDestiny> Yes.
[2:26:28] <%luftraumm1> yup
[2:26:28] <oda_flobunaga> yes
[2:26:28] <%Jerp> it's one of those terrible spellings
[2:26:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> Yeah
[2:26:29] <+xerj> depends
[2:26:31] <NewWillinium> Yep
[2:26:31] <HystericalCH> yeah
[2:26:31] <blue8moon> yes
[2:26:33] <%Valdorick> Yeah
[2:26:33] <deviljhojho_> english is fucked
[2:26:34] <TwistParabola> is it?
[2:26:34] <CheezeWolf> NotLikeThis
[2:26:35] <%greasypete00> yeah it is
[2:26:35] <%Nobrev> yeah pronounced like draft
[2:26:36] <%Niney_Who> That's why they were called that in Skyrim
[2:26:36] <+javolta> yes pat
[2:26:37] <%sporeian94> THANKS GEORGE
[2:26:37] <NewWillinium> . .How do you say it?
[2:26:38] <%Niney_Who> "draft"
[2:26:39] <MartyFun11> That's why we say draft now
[2:26:41] <Wakerz140> Absolutely not
[2:26:41] <Augus7717> the fuck
[2:26:43] <%crimsonharvest> thats real English too you can tell because of how bullshit it is
[2:26:44] <jeppeww> queue, 80% silent is also dumbo
[2:26:45] <Midnight188> thank Wales for that one
[2:26:50] <it_came_from_outer_space> its an old word
[2:26:53] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Drawft would also work
[2:26:53] <%Valdorick> You say in the game using the word "Gaol"
[2:26:56] <hermitdab> the only thing the french gave us is french fries
[2:26:57] <digaogrunge> Yes
[2:26:57] <%Jerp> english is just a bunch of other languages in a blender, served with lots of alcohol
[2:26:59] <N7Eventhorizon> is this your first playthrough?
[2:27:03] <%vivaldiva> english is half french, so you have half yourself to blame pat
[2:27:06] <HystericalCH> as someone that used to bartend, 'draft' is correct
[2:27:08] <%crimsonharvest> gowl
[2:27:20] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> hutdug
[2:27:21] <17sevens> went "no pat you're being stupOH MY GOD IT'S DRAFT?"
[2:27:23] <+RedMaskBandit> what's the context?
[2:27:29] <%Felhad> Fort! night!
[2:27:33] <+twdlrr> yeah Welsh is in a couple places in this game, thats why Blythe is Blaidd
[2:27:34] <%Brassnarwhal> yeah it's the worst especially cause drought and draught are spelled near identically and arent pronounced alike
[2:27:39] <timbolambo> hey pat my mom has he
[2:27:51] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the twin snakes live here
[2:27:55] <churropoppa> @PatStaresAt native english speakers love to talk about how hard it is. no dog, it's just a terrible language
[2:27:59] <%crimsonharvest> also 'draft' as a verb has at least two meanings, and at lest four as a noun
[2:28:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> RLM PICARD S2 REVIEWERS JUST UPLOADED
[2:28:03] <%fat_burtreynolds> Berserk monument
[2:28:09] <%maskofmichael> Yeah, English is stupid. Anyway, would anyone like some Ghoti?
[2:28:17] <%Jerp> oh that's cool as shit, there's a blood buildup over time field ... skill?
[2:28:17] <%RealThiele> Marika up to some shit
[2:28:17] <+extantCadence> Oh, that's not what I found when I came here
[2:28:22] <%Brassnarwhal> @twdlrr woolie refuses to say blaidds name right i hope pat makes fun of him for it next monday
[2:28:31] <+badhaye> This zone is related to Yura's quest!
[2:28:34] <fatalDestiny> <vowal>ght might as well be short hand for 'pronunciation is completely arbitrary' in english.
[2:28:46] <+NeonFishFace> you got this
[2:28:47] <+twdlrr> @Brassnarwhal I cant wait LUL
[2:28:50] <jubejube56> There might be too much game

[2:28:53] <Ner234> @maskofmichael i hate this word
[2:28:53] <KasiCrafter> Don't let it set in Pat

[2:29:04] <HystericalCH> don't worry pat only about a million more areas to go
[2:29:05] <Zebroneath> Melina should have dialogue at Church's of Marika graces
[2:29:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael the street i work on is spelled goethe it's pronounced gatey
[2:29:06] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> he is crying Sadge KILL HIM
[2:29:10] <%BlueLunecy> Man I hate em

[2:29:16] <%octavian_wolf> THESE GUYS
[2:29:18] <%crimsonharvest> death barfer
[2:29:19] <%RealThiele> bloodborne men
[2:29:21] <+NeonFishFace> THAT'S PRETTY NOT CHILL
[2:29:23] <+Jeshk0> very unchill
[2:29:30] <%boggsz12> i've been watching several different people stream this including you since it came out. i want to do like 8 different things at all times while im playing myself
[2:29:32] <%Brassnarwhal> not chill

[2:29:44] <%Brassnarwhal> THAT'S DEATH SMOKE PAT THEY ARE UNCHILL
[2:29:48] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I feel bad for these guys, tbh. They walk around and cry when they don't know you're there.
[2:30:00] <%RealThiele> this place is awesome
[2:30:15] <GenericTwitchAcc1> touch crests
[2:30:16] <%Bluwizard21> this ones annoying, 3rd one is a fake rock east north east of the grace in the woods

[2:31:01] <oda_flobunaga> HOLY FUCK I JUST KILLED MARIKA AFTER 2 DAYS
[2:31:20] <HystericalCH> damn nice spatial orientation
[2:31:23] <oda_flobunaga> Miquella
[2:31:33] <jubejube56> It's fiiiiiine
[2:31:33] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[2:31:34] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> its a poison swamp without the swamp
[2:31:35] <%luftraumm1> spoils much @oda_flobunaga
[2:31:43] <KasiCrafter> Pat plays games with tank controls. His sense of orientation is unmatched
[2:31:43] <TwistParabola> @oda_flobunaga melania
[2:31:44] <deviljhojho_> yeah
[2:31:45] <jacksawjack> one is in an illusory rock on a hill near the bridge

[2:32:03] <deviljhojho_> its actually mandela
[2:32:06] <%livi242> you can probably pass time til day
[2:32:07] <+NeonFishFace> vomit forest
[2:32:18] <oda_flobunaga> Sister Of Nurgle, her
[2:32:32] <yyyyfdugyu> melanin and melatonin
[2:32:42] <Sunstalker> This one sucks ass. There's aglowing rock near the biridge
[2:32:43] <%MaybeFalco> there's something about them having tentacles for a face that is deeply unsettling
[2:32:45] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[2:32:46] <+NeonFishFace> HAHA
[2:32:51] <%Niney_Who> ILLUSORY ROCK
[2:32:54] <%Dakuu75> I'm shocked you got that one. I had to look it up
[2:32:54] <TwistParabola> LUL
[2:32:54] <%RealThiele> its past the bridge
[2:32:54] <Sunstalker> YEAH I SPENT HALF AN HOUR ON THIS
[2:32:54] <tanarath> christ
[2:32:54] <HystericalCH> Nelson Mandela, Blade of Miquella
[2:32:55] <%MaybeFalco> ITS SO DIRTY
[2:32:56] <Alrom> it took me so long to find it
[2:32:58] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:33:04] <Ghostduck01> LUL
[2:33:04] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> leave message
[2:33:06] <jubejube56> Well time to hit every rock
[2:33:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Miyazaki you whore
[2:33:11] <@Spydurman> message
[2:33:19] <PunkZedB> that rock is the hardest boss in the game
[2:33:38] <LMTTN> Is any required/story content behind an illusory wall?
[2:33:41] <%RealThiele> Hidden Building!
[2:33:42] <$Bananamanstan> !uptime
[2:33:42] <@Moobot> @Bananamanstan I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 33m.
[2:33:43] <scientiafidem> Wait wtf I’ve beaten the game and I have no idea what you are doing.
[2:33:44] <%Jerp> I remember speculating that the day/night cycle would basically end up being used as world tendency, and yeah, lots of shit gets tough at night
[2:33:44] <PlumpPotatoRump> massage
[2:33:45] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you are wrong
[2:33:56] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> pat youre too hot to complain this much
[2:34:00] <STORMWIZARD1> Do u want sum cheese with that whine hmmmm lol
[2:34:03] <42nfl19> INVISIBLE
[2:34:10] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @LMTTN There's a secret boss behind a wall in one of the catacombs Pat went to that had part of Fia's quest behind it.
[2:34:22] <Sunstalker> I hope their next game, if it keeps up the intricate questlines, has some fkn tool to tell you where an npc went, like a magic compass or some shit. Tracking them down is almost impossible without a wiki sometimes
[2:34:32] <%zarkazeon> zarkazeon subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Yo Pat. Lendell (everything in that smaller ramparted section) is the next main path area for you. hopefully this helps with the overwhelming feeling as you can totally leave it for last after you explore gelmir. :)
[2:34:40] <%RealThiele> the whole building being invisible was pretty cool
[2:34:54] <%twistedj3ster> not every tree has one
[2:35:05] <marvel877> Just got in, how goes Pat's adventures i n Brazil?
[2:35:06] <Sunstalker> there isn't one. Its replaced by one of these ugly hooded things, the big one.
[2:35:21] <sirrice77> this tree has a wormface instead of an avatar i think
[2:35:22] <LMTTN> @Sunstalker I don't think a really basic journal (like Morrowind's) would detract from this game's questing
[2:35:26] <$Bananamanstan> pat i love watching you play this game, but you sold me on it so im gona have to stop
[2:35:29] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> hahahah
[2:35:29] <TwistParabola> old codger ahead
[2:35:30] <MartyFun11> There isn't an avatar, but there's a big guy to kill
[2:35:32] <%Dakuu75> enjoy the field trip
[2:35:36] <calmsoul689> oh no pat
[2:35:36] <TwistParabola> slow fellow ahead
[2:35:42] <KasiCrafter> Good thing we have Unseen Form!
[2:35:58] <PunkZedB> don't give up, old codger!
[2:36:06] <jubejube56> Maybe it's not so bad fighting them in a group of 4
[2:36:09] <Sunstalker> @Sunstalker Not even a journal, just something to find out here an npc goes after they leave you. Like a magic mirror to talk to them. Something.
[2:36:10] <%Dakuu75> dude, I good-rated like 50 messages while follwing this guy
[2:36:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Sunstalker That was the exact thing I mentioned when talking to a friend about this game. An in-character journal of stuff that helps you keep track of everything would be great, especially since our character is much more vocal now.
[2:36:19] <%Brassnarwhal> can't see shit captain
[2:36:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> The sounds are unnerving.
[2:36:44] <$Bananamanstan> how many npc's has pat killed
[2:36:59] <%fat_burtreynolds> Just ghosty noises
[2:37:04] <%Buzzard42> all of them
[2:37:07] <%Buzzard42> or none of them
[2:37:08] <Ell1ot> i think i can listen to this sound to help me fall asleep
[2:37:20] <%Bluwizard21> yes
[2:37:21] <Sunstalker> yes pat
[2:37:26] <sirrice77> he's killed one who he revived and i think he's done some of the volcano manor quests so those guys too
[2:37:44] <Sunstalker> There was also a miniboss at the tree.
[2:37:53] <%Brassnarwhal> i thought they don't appear if you've found their secret?
[2:38:00] <+tizziks> *gold
[2:38:02] <%Buzzard42> wrath of gold
[2:38:02] <TwistParabola> GOLD
[2:38:02] <%Valdorick> Gold*
[2:38:04] <%TG_Cid11> fucking WoG
[2:38:10] <$Bananamanstan> so whos going to be the new to souls like that he or wooly run through this for the best ending?
[2:38:10] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> gold
[2:38:13] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal which ones?
[2:38:16] <%BlueLunecy> No he's right that's Wrath of God
[2:38:17] <%Brassnarwhal> oh but if gooooold
[2:38:18] <%RealThiele> Cannot be regenerated
[2:38:18] <%Buzzard42> what even is the elden ring
[2:38:20] <terrible35> Great 4 Mana Staple
[2:38:31] <jubejube56> ....they might actually be shit heads
[2:38:32] <%Buzzard42> wrath of cod
[2:38:32] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal He hadn't cleared it
[2:38:34] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 the ghosts and the pointer statues that lead you to things
[2:38:37] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> the elden ring is the friends we made along the way
[2:38:45] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Buzzard42 That's... complicated.
[2:38:45] <%fat_burtreynolds> See ya jerkass
[2:38:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker that makes sense
[2:39:02] <$Bananamanstan> the elden ring is the ending to one peice
[2:39:11] <%cade_calrayn> It is, yeah, it's that symbol
[2:39:12] <mike2hands> are we the elden ring?
[2:39:12] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> thats a dumb theory
[2:39:18] <%Buzzard42> is the elden ring the friends we made along the way
[2:39:28] <%Cozy90> elden ring is slang for butthole
[2:39:30] <%Brassnarwhal> it's the friends we made along the way
[2:39:31] <digaogrunge> It was a beast
[2:39:31] <NewWillinium> Man you throw those Spears FAST. Do you have like. . 40 Dex as well?
[2:39:34] <%cade_calrayn> the Great Runes you find specifically say so, they're pieces of it. If you overlay all of them they form the symbol
[2:39:36] <%Brassnarwhal> fuck too slow
[2:39:38] <%maskofmichael> Elden Ring? Is that like the One Piece?
[2:39:40] <Sunstalker> All i'll say is you find out more at the end.
[2:39:42] <+twdlrr> Didn't that one miracle say what the elden ring is?
[2:39:51] <%cade_calrayn> like, Godrick's rune is the center of the symbol
[2:39:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @maskofmichael basically yes
[2:39:57] <%RealThiele> rats drop runes arcs eventually my goblins with them are gone
[2:40:00] <Tenebrae94> agh the evo lineup is starting soon
[2:40:07] <$Bananamanstan> final boss ends upbeing luffy
[2:40:12] <GrenYena> What great sword is that? @PatStaresAt
[2:40:18] <+BeatBoxersDevMike> "be sure to eld your ring, john darksouls"
[2:40:19] <scientiafidem> So has anyone figured out how to finish Nepheli‘s quest yet? The last step I have been able to get to still feels very incomplete.
[2:40:31] <%fat_burtreynolds> Had no idea that Elden ring was based out of Talladega, FL
[2:40:37] <+mondumbra> the lore in this is very similar to me as the first dark souls
[2:40:38] <%luftraumm1> cool mask
[2:40:42] <%TheAdMerlin> That was a cool looking helmet tho
[2:40:45] <%radiorosewater> THEYRE FREAKS
[2:40:50] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @scientiafidem Did you get her the summon?
[2:40:50] <%Brassnarwhal> @bananamanstan it's a group fight you get to bring whichever npcs ghosts whose quests you completed luffy brings his crew
[2:41:01] <$drabberfaun535> has pat beaten the blood lord yet?
[2:41:03] <sirrice77> @scientiafidem Nope, people have datamined dialogue that clearly is from later in her quest but no one knows how to get there
[2:41:05] <%Cozy90> get good scrub
[2:41:17] <%xcompleasedad> Ah, yes. The Invasion Hole.
[2:41:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> you need 8
[2:41:28] <$Bananamanstan> will this end up being a 1 off game or will it be the new main series?
[2:41:35] <%fat_burtreynolds> Nothing like a good ol anti air bolt to the face psaGotcha
[2:41:36] <scientiafidem> @fenrisulfr_v yeah, that is the last step I could get to.
[2:41:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I think Nepheli's quest is related to Kenneth Haight's to some degree, since she's clearly directly related to Hourah Loux.
[2:41:39] <$Bananamanstan> because how long will ER@ take to make
[2:41:50] <sothatsprettybrutal> the end of the quest only unlocks after full nuclear disarmament
[2:41:51] <Omenaire_> 🐌
[2:41:56] <NewWillinium> It's a pain to have to Magic Arrow it to death
[2:42:09] <jubejube56> Oh god the level design
[2:42:13] <jubejube56> it burns the brain
[2:42:20] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> jump for secret
[2:42:23] <LMTTN> @Bananamanstan I could see From revisiting a fully open-world within or without ER
[2:42:29] <Sunstalker> @scientiafidem Use the roots
[2:42:34] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> :)
[2:42:35] <TwistParabola> up the branch

[2:42:44] <Sunstalker> @scientiafidem sorry, didn't mean to type in response

[2:43:02] <%fat_burtreynolds> Hidden floor?
[2:43:03] <%xJavinero> xJavinero subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Hope everyone is having a good day!
[2:43:14] <%justcallmebobplease> Can you stack them for silly equip load?  I assume so.
[2:43:22] <scientiafidem> @fenrisulfr_v yeah his also feels extremely incomplete. I agree it seems like they are supposed to link up.
[2:43:26] <%Brassnarwhal> @justcallmebobplease no
[2:43:27] <%MaybeFalco> or in case you straight up never went into caelid
[2:43:30] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> @PatStaresAt will you play the new kirby demo on stream?
[2:43:44] <%Brassnarwhal> @justcallmebobplease can't equip 2 of the same talisman even with a +
[2:43:51] <%xJavinero> what sword is that?
[2:43:53] <%maskofmichael> but WILL you?
[2:43:57] <@Ranryu692> it's pretty short, you can start a stream with it and then switch to Elden Ring
[2:43:57] <phtephe_> Time for best girl
[2:44:01] <%Delenay> how long is the demo?
[2:44:02] <Saltmeisterr> kriby good
[2:44:13] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> kirby's rolls are some of the best rolls in gaming
[2:44:14] <%luftraumm1> regular cristalians tho
[2:44:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @xjavinero it's the one dropped by the gargoyle outside of beast church
[2:44:16] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @scientiafidem Wait, isn't there a strategy guide for this game? Wouldn't it be in there?
[2:44:16] <%RealThiele> not rotted ezpz
[2:44:18] <%justcallmebobplease> I hoped they'd count as different talismans given they had different names, and not the same owing to having the same type of core effect - ah well!
[2:44:19] <Saltmeisterr> they gave kriby a greatsword
[2:44:21] <jubejube56> only 2 non-rotting crystalians?
[2:44:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> This is like concrete proof in my eyes that this area comes before that other one
[2:44:28] <jubejube56> tsk tsk
[2:44:29] <%Jerp> oh shit you know what?  I just realized the attack height on that spear dude
[2:44:31] <mike2hands> GADAAAAM
[2:44:33] <penitentpendant> Good ole Greg
[2:44:36] <%Valdorick> You and your mimic tear got pancaked at the same time LUL
[2:44:44] <%Brassnarwhal> these guys are so much less annoying with my flail build
[2:44:48] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Once you crack them, they're obscenely fragile.
[2:44:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> dude, wtf is that gear
[2:44:54] <PunkZedB> stando powaaa
[2:45:02] <%xJavinero> @Brassnarwhal ok hes wrecking my existance rn but looks worth
[2:45:04] <%Brassnarwhal> @saltmeisterr let's be clear here kirby been had a greatsword
[2:45:07] <%Jerp> is it possible to just crouch walk around the spear guy and not get hit? does it aim down?
[2:45:11] <KasiCrafter> Finally getting your bearings
[2:45:22] <Saltmeisterr> @Brassnarwhal true
[2:45:31] <%MaybeFalco> did you ever manage to clear the one with the three crystal dudes?
[2:45:34] <Saltmeisterr> i forgot about RTD
[2:45:40] <MartyFun11> There's something to fight at the erdtree
[2:45:41] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There IS a boss at that Erdtree.
[2:45:42] <Saltmeisterr> @MaybeFalco Yep
[2:45:48] <+RedMaskBandit> it's so surreal that I'm a lil bit ahead of u
[2:45:53] <%twistedj3ster> I'm interested in that town brassnarwhal mentioned
[2:45:56] <sirrice77> yeah the boss is a giant worm man
[2:45:57] <scientiafidem> It’s crazy how the best summon by far uses zero FP, makes mind kinda pointless for non mage builds.
[2:45:59] <Sunstalker> Find the big hooded fuck.
[2:46:00] <%justcallmebobplease> BOY IS THERE
[2:46:05] <%justcallmebobplease> Interesting boss.

[2:49:29] <penitentpendant> The fact that those are 'everlasting poos' makes them all the more horrifying
[2:49:30] <WorstThingsFirst> You picked up a Digimon.
[2:49:31] <%TheAdMerlin> Gold tinged poop, not fully gold poop
[2:49:37] <%Brassnarwhal> what a shitty drop
[2:49:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I feel like those guys are probably what Rogier was going to turn into if he didn't die.
[2:49:41] <%RealThiele> windmill time!

[2:50:41] <+crocodile_t34rz> The EVER BRILLIANT Goldmask to you
[2:50:41] <sirrice77> @PatStaresAt so goldmask's quest is tied with cleric man's quest so you have to find him first
[2:50:42] <%Fenrisulfr_V> He's such a goober, I love him
[2:50:42] <NewWillinium> Is Gold Mask one of the Onyx Lord people?
[2:50:43] <Midnight188> he is TALL and POINTING

[2:51:06] <Sunstalker> Corbyn's at the road north from the lift, close to where the map obelisk was
[2:51:12] <NewWillinium> . . Okay I would have loved to know that about the Wind Tunnel drop thing
[2:51:15] <%solracc25> praise sun?
[2:51:18] <Sol_Install> oh wat
[2:51:18] <Sunstalker> Its under the bridge
[2:51:21] <blue8moon> there's a grace on the south end of the broken bridge with a teleport to goldmask too
[2:51:24] <%fat_burtreynolds> Pat going on roughly 2.5 hrs by now?
[2:51:28] <%luftraumm1> @PatStaresAt check lore on adjudicator shield
[2:51:34] <Sunstalker> But on the higher elevation
[2:51:40] <Dopamien> twitch plays elden ring
[2:51:57] <%fat_burtreynolds> Here’s where I drew some blud
[2:52:10] <PlumpPotatoRump> classic
[2:52:11] <%Brassnarwhal> if anyone doesn't get the could this be giant messages around the windmills, the band there might be giants is named after a thing from don quixote where they mistook windmills for giants
[2:52:11] <%luftraumm1> tree greatshield?
[2:52:12] <%TG_Cid11> Sanctus
[2:52:30] <Sunstalker> Its under the most northern bit
[2:52:34] <%RealThiele> skeleton armor + shield + talisman regen build
[2:52:37] <%Brassnarwhal> i wrote their name wrong in a highlighted message like an idiot
[2:52:40] <adamant1333> evo is on stream
[2:52:48] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal thanks, i am an uncultured pleb so i wouldn't know
[2:52:56] <%solracc25> yo regen
[2:53:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> Pat I found another chariot dungeon
[2:53:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> It sucks shit
[2:53:22] <Khester824> Regen on skeli armor only happens near death
[2:53:23] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 idk if you're being sarcastic i just love trivia and this was a time where trivia met dark souls
[2:53:24] <Sunstalker> CLOSE TO THE MAP OBELISK
[2:53:29] <%RealThiele> @ReallyBigRocks gelmir hero grave?
[2:53:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> @RealThiele ye
[2:53:51] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @RealThiele Plus Crimson Talisman + Sepernt God's Sword
[2:53:56] <phtephe_> Oh wow he's been grinding
[2:53:59] <LMTTN> Would even the best possible regen setup regenerate fast enough to build around?
[2:54:09] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fight the bigfoot boss next pls :)
[2:54:10] <AgnusLaplace> that's a lot o' levels
[2:54:21] <sirrice77> @Brassnarwhal no it wasn't sarcastic, like thanks for pointing it out because i did not know
[2:54:28] <+extantCadence> You know Elden Ring is a perfect game because you can T-pose in it
[2:54:30] <LMTTN> They all can stack?
[2:54:30] <+doe3879> wow, i'm like 4 zone passed this place and only level 100
[2:54:34] <KasiCrafter> I'd say it's gorgeous! There are gorges everywhere!
[2:54:41] <oda_flobunaga> There are Lifesteal ashes of war that kick ass
[2:54:44] <$ArcanumArcanum> regen via spells doesn't stack, but I dunno about regen from other sources
[2:54:51] <%Brassnarwhal> @sirrice77 glad to hear it and glad you found it interesting
[2:55:02] <%Felhad> They can stack, but each is like... 2hp/s
[2:55:03] <jbrachob> any time i see golden mask i just start hearing dagothwave in the background
[2:55:12] <RustyQuarters> <3 tree
[2:55:13] <$ArcanumArcanum> I tried the beast regen and the erdtree miracle regen, and it only gives the latest cast
[2:55:14] <%Brassnarwhal> @arcanumarcanum regen from physic and incant stack in my experience
[2:55:17] <Zourath> Seems like it's the way you'd need to go to build around the self-damaging spells.
[2:55:36] <LMTTN> yeah I figured it wouldn't be very fast. I remember that one MP regen ring in Demon's Souls regenerated at a snail's pace
[2:55:41] <Augus7717> that jailer cinematic is hilarious LUL
[2:55:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @zourath i use a regen flask with the blood slash art it's very helpful
[2:55:50] <%BinaryFireball> is pat lvl 200 yet?
[2:56:03] <%TG_Cid11> man Pat really out leveled the rest of the game
[2:56:10] <%RealThiele> well the regen talisman is 4hp/sec so i think regen would be doable
[2:56:16] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> fight the insurgency next
[2:56:22] <%luftraumm1> your face is crooked?
[2:56:23] <+Pachi3000> no sporting here, bro
[2:56:24] <penitentpendant> He was just standing there... MENACINGLY
[2:56:26] <%TheAdMerlin> Those giant transparent banners are like Radavid's fight
[2:56:30] <%greasypete00> this guy is a weirdo
[2:56:36] <%Brassnarwhal> @tg_cid11 he also beat all of caelid underleveled which was pretty raw
[2:56:38] <Khester824> YOU PRANKING ME!?
[2:56:38] <ezakur> Has Pat gotten the chest he missed in Renna's Rise?
[2:56:43] <eleskei> the music distorted for me and it reminds me of silent hill
[2:56:46] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> the desert
[2:56:48] <oda_flobunaga> Right there
[2:56:48] <%BinaryFireball> which dragon?
[2:56:54] <Saturation_Lizard> the area you pointed at yeah
[2:56:55] <+Pachi3000> ARE YOU DOING ME A BAMBOOZLE, TARNISHED
[2:57:00] <Augus7717> yeah right thereish
[2:57:08] <%Brassnarwhal> it's by the carriages
[2:57:10] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @BinaryFireball Ancient Dragon Lacudisax or whatever his name is.
[2:57:12] <%RealThiele> ancient dragons :E
[2:57:13] <+alphonseisbest> Pat did u know theres a prayer book the
[2:57:16] <domukujira> how far is he progressed?
[2:57:19] <ezakur> And did Pat fight the "invaders" in front of the GIANT JAR?
[2:57:20] <jubejube56> what if that entire mountain is a hidden wall tho
[2:57:24] <%Brassnarwhal> i think the bonfire is called abandoned coffin or some shit
[2:57:34] <%RealThiele> @ezakur yep
[2:57:39] <Augus7717> yes
[2:57:45] <42nfl19> dog?
[2:57:45] <+Faultlined> Is this dog
[2:57:48] <Augus7717> weapon upgrades do A LOT
[2:57:51] <ezakur> Great
[2:57:54] <%RealThiele> access to respec items is also pretty great to have by now
[2:57:58] <+alphonseisbest> that teaches lightning spear
[2:58:05] <%Brassnarwhal> @augus7717 especially the unique ones
[2:58:21] <+extantCadence> The areas in Ranni's quest make it so easy to get special weapons and to +9 and named summons to +10, plus access to the respec item farm
[2:58:21] <jubejube56> Is that a merchant song?
[2:58:23] <Gelphaze> Pat I just found the devil on this game I'm scared.
[2:58:26] <%radiorosewater> so i thought about and this works on a fundamental level because
[2:58:29] <%TheGuesty> great lightning spear is later
[2:58:32] <stormhawk9891> Has Pat been to Dominula yet?
[2:58:39] <+alphonseisbest> yea but didn't the one u get drop of a guy by itself?
[2:58:44] <$sleepystardewfarmer> what was that red attack pat just did?
[2:58:49] <%Valdorick> Did you know there's no upgrade to Lightning Spear... it feels bad.
[2:58:52] <%RealThiele> thanks grandma swamp
[2:58:52] <Midnight188> Ranni's questline feels like The Good Ending despite the places it takes you
[2:58:53] <Augus7717> why is the old lady posed up like a frog?
[2:58:54] <+alphonseisbest> unless I'm off about that
[2:58:54] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You notice thoughs finger women have memory necklaces?
[2:58:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest nah it was a book
[2:59:12] <%fat_burtreynolds> Mmmmmm fattening
[2:59:14] <+alphonseisbest> ah my bad then
[2:59:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> cool shield
[2:59:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest the solo faith thing was the holy sword buff thing
[2:59:34] <+alphonseisbest> ooooooh
[2:59:36] <%greasypete00> god this games music is good
[2:59:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @alphonseisbest i mixed it up too that's why I'm so certain lol
[2:59:49] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> we're all judging you for this pat
[2:59:50] <Sunstalker> One of these notes is important, the other just confuses you. The imp shades one just hints at something in it's dungeon.
[2:59:52] <sun312772> yep
[2:59:55] <$OfficerMods> that shield is really good if you want more armor in exchange for the gold great shield
[3:00:02] <%RealThiele> that graveyard is a bitch
[3:00:10] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt fuck like that advice sucks or fuck I wish I knew this sooner?
[3:00:17] <godlesscruelty> Seek Torch, Seek Dog - Elden Ring community
[3:00:19] <$OfficerMods> armor and damage reduction is actually really good but only if you put on the absolute heaviest armor
[3:00:44] <TwistParabola> the direction isnt actually indicative
[3:00:51] <%greasypete00> teleporter direction doesnt seem to always line up perfectly
[3:00:52] <Wakerz140> So the direction of the teleporters doesn't seem to matter
[3:00:58] <%greasypete00> if at all
[3:01:06] <jbrachob> What a grand and intoxicating innocence!
[3:01:07] <%TG_Cid11> I killed goldmask
[3:01:07] <thesaverofhumens> Gol D. Mask
[3:01:09] <+Pachi3000> they chillin
[3:01:14] <+Pachi3000> they are now bros
[3:01:15] <scientiafidem> @midnight188 Ranni’s ending feels like the good end on it’s surface but I feel like the more you learn about Ranni and the things she did and the more your learn about the “stars” the more it seems like a bad end.
[3:01:23] <LMTTN> Bill Goldmask
[3:01:26] <%Brassnarwhal> we gotta make sure pat finds the hammer in windmillvill it's very cool
[3:01:31] <eleskei> um

[3:01:55] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Gold mask is a slowpoke

[3:20:05] <Saturation_Lizard> @PatStaresAt oh check the giant rat ashes if you didn't already, it has 2 special properties
[3:20:11] <%Brassnarwhal> read it too
[3:20:12] <%Archmortal> words like bottom and middle are functionally worthless for this map
[3:20:17] <%Brassnarwhal> yeah sorry pat my bad
[3:20:25] <+machshop> ratJAM
[3:20:32] <NewWillinium> The Giant Rats are kind of dope actually. Weak yeah but last a long while
[3:20:33] <jubejube56> Wait it gives you money for each attack?!
[3:20:49] <lethallylactic> That's cool
[3:20:50] <%kyh9> But they cant cross water
[3:20:52] <%Dakuu75> ooooh... neat
[3:20:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @jubejube56 that's why i was desperate for him to find it it's cool
[3:20:54] <%kyh9> Big downside
[3:20:55] <+Grayhammatter> rats, rats, we're the rats
[3:20:57] <+Kenzo2000> @PatStaresAt Hey, haven't been able to watch much, so sorry if this has been answered. How does this game play from a speed and character control standpoint? Slow chunky DS1 or speedy bloodborne?
[3:20:58] <+MisterAvry> yes, rat crowd!
[3:20:59] <Kain5707> Pat have you tried mimic yet?
[3:21:00] <Sunstalker> Yeah, I found a few HP using summons so far
[3:21:00] <MidnightPacif1c> rat king build
[3:21:00] <KasiCrafter> Rat zerg rush
[3:21:01] <+TeoXDR> rat pack
[3:21:04] <XxMoliciousxX> SL1?
[3:21:08] <Ner234> True
[3:21:14] <%Archmortal> my fourth character is fully going rat build
[3:21:17] <%MaybeFalco> rats can swim
[3:21:23] <42nfl19> does this make Pat the rat king
[3:21:24] <%Brassnarwhal> oh my god I'm leveling up the rats i didnt even read them
[3:21:33] <%kyh9> I'm enjoying it though.
[3:21:37] <+machshop> daggum trebuchets
[3:21:44] <%kyh9> But this voice acting is hilarious sometimes too, especially the non-party NPCs
[3:21:45] <+MisterAvry> that's the way it be
[3:21:48] <%Archmortal> HA
[3:21:48] <Kain5707> @42nfl19 Jerma still wears that crown
[3:21:52] <%Brassnarwhal> @42nfl19 only if he's the biggest rat so he can make all the rules
[3:21:55] <GrenYena> golden seed
[3:21:58] <+5Two> Someone forgot to tell them the war is over.

[3:22:08] <+MisterAvry> you don't think it be like it is, but it DO
[3:22:09] <%Brassnarwhal> that's just how it is on this bitch of an earth
[3:22:12] <hermitdab> @Kenzo2000 not as fast as bloodborne but faster than ds1 for most weapons. The rolls seem very forgiving at times too
[3:22:15] <%Archmortal> are you winnin', Pat
[3:22:16] <NBUsagi> Gief "Gimme chickn"

[3:23:00] <%Smokay17> Smokay17 subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat, thanks for providing us with almost daily Elden Ring streams. The amount of content this game has is incredible.

[3:23:19] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> letsgo
[3:23:20] <$OfficerMods> pats gone talk about the ending
[3:23:22] <%twistedj3ster> Mini man faults mini pig for death

[3:23:28] <+ScatFace> the black gargoyle GS
[3:23:38] <Kain5707> yea
[3:23:45] <Kain5707> its a good holy weapon
[3:23:45] <%Brassnarwhal> @officermods you don't seem like a very good cop officer mods
[3:23:48] <LMTTN> I'm in a hotel room six hours from home I just wanna resume Elden Ring
[3:23:56] <ItsMisterJason> Excuse me dancing people this is a no fun zone thank you. Frollicking will be punished
[3:23:59] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> stay away from the windmills monkaS the energy gives you cancer
[3:24:06] <+MisterAvry> aww I used to call my dog doo doo
[3:24:25] <%Brassnarwhal> @itsmisterjason we do in fact frown on dancing around some dudes that are on fire yes
[3:24:30] <+ScatFace> @lmttn elden ring is my motivation to go back from work
[3:24:34] <+Pendragwn> @LMTTN steam link+controller if you're desperate enough to lag roll every fight lol
[3:24:36] <ReenBenkyou> does anyone know of any sites that have started collecting Elden Ring lore together? I'd love to read more about it.
[3:24:42] <tri3dgE027> Any reason why you decided to switch from the Godslayer Sword?  Does the Gargoyle Sword have a better Faith scaling?
[3:24:45] <42nfl19> They don't get confused using so many nicknames?
[3:24:51] <LMTTN> @LMTTN That'd be nice but I have it on PS4 lol
[3:24:54] <ArgusStrav> How many hours does Pat have in the game at this point?
[3:25:08] <%luftraumm1> godslayer is also pretty one note
[3:25:13] <+Pendragwn> any reason you felt like it
[3:25:13] <%Brassnarwhal> @argusstrav many
[3:25:22] <+MisterAvry> @42nfl19 nah my dog had like hundred of nicknames but she knew you were talking to her
[3:25:22] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat had a God SLayer sword? You mean the Black Flame one?
[3:25:25] <Kain5707> have you fought Radahn yet?
[3:25:32] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> total war sim
[3:25:36] <+BigGooj> pat what was the reason you decided to be smelly
[3:25:38] <%Felhad> There's too many weapons to stick with 1 the whole way
[3:25:38] <%TheAdMerlin> Probably that god skinner twin blade
[3:25:39] <$OfficerMods> when you are this hilarously over leveled you can just use whatever your fancy
[3:25:46] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt Did you ever go back to clear out Redmane Castle properly with it's alt bossfight?
[3:25:51] <Midnight188> this new Mount & Blade game seems rad
[3:26:05] <sirrice77> @Kain5707 he smoked radahn in like 5 tries
[3:26:11] <%Brassnarwhal> you can change the wa on that money hammer to make it holy if you are feeling like making some cash
[3:26:13] <Midnight188> who knew FromSoft got the Mount & Blade liscence Kappa
[3:26:14] <Sunstalker> isn't the new Flamberge design just so pretty?
[3:26:15] <ArgusStrav> As someone who obsessively tries to clear areas, Elden Ring is both amazing and incredibly annoying
[3:26:24] <%luftraumm1> i'm not very sure on that armor tho
[3:26:28] <sweatch0> hypothetically if you encountered the giant rat "who makes all of the rules" would you then proceed to break of follow these rules?  @patstaresat
[3:26:29] <+ScatFace> what level is pat in anyways?
[3:26:32] <Kain5707> @Kain5707 nice did he find the cave in the back?
[3:26:35] <%JohnAtDawn> You cheesed with rot, but sure he's easy LUL
[3:26:40] <%OrangeMDT> Could you imagine this game being LP’d on the old channel? We’d probably just be getting to Weeping Peninsula at that old content schedule
[3:26:40] <$OfficerMods> like 156
[3:26:40] <sirrice77> I hope to god you just destroy the other "problem" boss in one try
[3:26:45] <%RealThiele> Antspur with bleed art melted Radahn was great
[3:26:47] <%Niney_Who> Definitely check out that gate Pat
[3:26:48] <+ScatFace> because that's a large ass HP bar
[3:26:53] <ItsMisterJason> The greatest thing about Radah is the summons just crouch under his magic arrows. LUL
[3:26:54] <%luftraumm1> the lower road you havent explored
[3:26:56] <LMTTN> I rest until morning every time it gets dark and I have probably missed so many bosses doing this
[3:27:03] <+KipTheSmuggler> @PatStaresAt where did u find that red haired lady?

[3:27:15] <ItsMisterJason> The AI just fucking ducks and we're over here rolling
[3:27:19] <%Cozy90> This is the first souls game where i went dual daggers. theres some fun stuff in here
[3:27:26] <meloshav> has pat got to the live action hard-core pornography section yet?
[3:27:27] <scientiafidem> The radahn fight was a cool idea but really sucked to actually play.
[3:27:28] <sun312772> One of the dark souls chest in elden ring has the chain facing the other way like a mimic chest would
[3:27:35] <Alrom> There is a hero grave around. those are always fun, right
[3:27:36] <+MisterAvry> "fatherm my chops desire food!"
[3:27:38] <%RealThiele> @KipTheSmuggler quest starts at gowrys shack in caelid

[3:48:36] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt so, apparently, that Amber Starlight item is for Seluvis if you gave Nepheli the potion; he later tries to create a potion to "turn even a demi-god into a puppet". So the slimy bitch was gonna betray Ranni

[3:48:39] <%Cozy90> im dual weilding those pat. there are very cool
[3:48:51] <Ner234> @Kain5707 Oh that's way worse than what I thought it would be ... probably funny the first time but still ....

[3:51:34] <+LandOfTheWay> the winged sword talisman seems busted for weapons like twinblades or fists
[3:51:46] <domukujira> sens
[3:52:07] <RustyQuarters> There's a lot of spookies in here
[3:52:10] <tri3dgE027> Good opportunity to use the AoE Sweep Incantation
[3:52:11] <%baka_sugoi> womp womp
[3:52:12] <SubjectX07x> @LandOfTheWay I use it with the Hand of Malenia.
[3:52:17] <Sunstalker> Winged sword talisman does NOT boost power on stuff like continious weapon skills. Shame, would be good fit for Wild Strikes
[3:52:20] <%ShawnTK_> no you pulled it
[3:52:20] <%Delenay> opened the door
[3:52:23] <%MaybeFalco> you did, it opened the door

[3:52:27] <+thickshield> there is no lever for that door
[3:52:30] <jubejube56> you did this mid combat
[3:52:34] <sweatch0> anyone encountered any enemies that use "sleep" status?

[3:59:10] <SubjectX07x> @jubejube56 I don't really care for the knife much since you get its weapon art as a spell late game.
[3:59:12] <Aussie_Manny> That was overkill. monkaS
[3:59:15] <%luftraumm1> its a straight upgrade to the ice one
[3:59:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> too bad its super slow

[4:00:28] <%AnthroMetal> @Kain5707 @zaddyforever yee finally
[4:00:29] <Willowight> faith just looks more fun
[4:00:29] <SubjectX07x> @alphonseisbest I honestly prefer ancient dragon lightning strike over it, similar damage but in all directions and if it's a large boss it can get hit numerous times.
[4:00:33] <eleskei> this is just that boss from evil within

[4:08:24] <%jamsbybetty> the mimic also willl use consumable on the bar
[4:08:32] <%jamsbybetty> I feed mine exalted flesh
[4:08:32] <sweatch0> whats up with the red fella in there? he wont talk to me
[4:08:48] <Alrom> @RyuuAoi I honestly doubt it
[4:08:52] <%Maids4lyfe> don't worry about him
[4:08:52] <+Shimano232> Hey pat, I learned recently that you can kill all the random no name merchants and get there bells and make this shop into 1 super shop. really helpful when trying to remember who sells what items.
[4:08:55] <Kain5707> @jamsbybetty oh shit i didnt know that do they use special flask too?
[4:09:04] <RyuuAoi> @alrom Honestly. Same.
[4:09:06] <+zaddyforever> @sweatch0 the dung eater? you get an item eventually that’ll start his questline
[4:09:06] <%Cozy90> @sweatch0 go back later when you find somethin  called seedbed
[4:09:07] <Sunstalker> @RyuuAoi Nah, hasn't even gone inside capital yet
[4:09:11] <+chadwicktouchdown> anyone know the established SL for pvp?
[4:09:30] <sweatch0> roger that @cozy90
[4:09:43] <+alphonseisbest> @shimano232 omg That's evil... and a gtk ty!
[4:09:45] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> monkaS so many +
[4:09:53] <Sunstalker> I hate this trend of not giving the HUB blacksmith materials to sell to you. Got to trek to the other ass end of the hub to buy them if you're short one
[4:09:54] <reasonance> there's a mace/axe specific weapon ash that does a big overhead and procs a free AoE heal if it hits; hilarious with the mimic and you both bonking the boss and healing each other
[4:09:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @chadwicktouchdown 100-120
[4:09:59] <RyuuAoi> @sunstalker Storm the cap?
[4:10:12] <Augus7717> is guard boost just stability from DS1-3?
[4:10:21] <%jamsbybetty> @jamsbybetty the physik? I don't think so
[4:10:21] <reasonance> @Augus7717 yes
[4:10:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Yeah
[4:10:24] <%Dustin_Gunn> More importantly, mimics can use consumables like the insanely powerful perfumes
[4:10:33] <Bullethead1010> You should use a flail Pat so you can flail about
[4:10:40] <jubejube56> If you wanted a quick detour I think something is new with Iji too
[4:10:44] <Kain5707> @reasonance its basically a paladin specific build its pretty sick
[4:10:49] <%baka_sugoi> crazy
[4:10:49] <+zaddyforever> @dustin_gunn i STILL haven’t found a single perfume recipe or anything 67 hours in
[4:10:51] <%MaybeFalco> pr LUL gress

[4:12:18] <+Jeshk0> wtf
[4:12:21] <ItsMisterJason> Did we let someone out?
[4:12:21] <%Felhad> ironmouseScared ironmouseScared ironmouseScared ironmouseScared
[4:12:22] <%Cozy90> @Khester824 theres a button you can hit to make the hot spots where people are appear
[4:12:24] <tri3dgE027> Read the Helmet description
[4:12:27] <MidnightPacif1c> BibleThump
[4:12:27] <%maskofmichael> What you do to him Pat? Why'd YOU kill him?
[4:12:28] <+alphonseisbest> GODSKIN BASTERD SSSSSS
[4:12:32] <%MaybeFalco> man fuck those assassins, Iji was cool
[4:12:34] <senfood> He took them with him when he went out...
[4:12:35] <RyuuAoi> Oh he ded.
[4:12:35] <Kain5707> ?
[4:12:39] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> they godskinned iji?
[4:12:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pay Respects Pat with a gesture
[4:12:42] <+TeoXDR> did you already go back to ranni's rise
[4:12:44] <Ghostduck01> BibleThump
[4:12:45] <%Felhad> @patstaresat look at his head... angle
[4:12:50] <asleepykitten1> He took some of those fucks with him tho...
[4:12:57] <bassoontyphoon> Why would the Al Bhed do this??
[4:12:57] <tri3dgE027> He either got assassinated or he peaced-out himself
[4:12:58] <signofzeta> yeah this part is sad
[4:13:00] <%Cozy90> giant blacksmiths have bad luck
[4:13:08] <%cade_calrayn> Wait, the Black Knives *work* for the Erdtree and the Two Fingers, but they killed Godwyn? How does that make sense?
[4:13:10] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> his head is towards the sun PogBones
[4:13:11] <Questiy> Basically helping Ranni ascend showed the Two Fingers she was still alive and painted a target on everyone
[4:13:15] <%cade_calrayn> something's off
[4:13:17] <%watts121> I thought Ranni controlled the Black Knives?!!?
[4:13:24] <%Felhad> He got fucked up
[4:13:25] <tri3dgE027> technically he was the only one left
[4:13:31] <signofzeta> assassinated 100%
[4:13:32] <%cade_calrayn> No, the Black Knives have been hunting Ranni
[4:13:33] <%Felhad> Its super sideways
[4:13:45] <%Archmortal> Ranni created the knives, but they don't work for her
[4:14:03] <IvanMistwalker> REVENGE ARC!
[4:14:06] <eleskei> scenery looks amazing
[4:14:10] <%Archmortal> (like created the literal weapons, not the group)
[4:14:14] <%baka_sugoi> the JEBUS
[4:14:15] <scientiafidem> Those assassins aren’t from erdtree, they work for ranni, she’s the one who gave them the rune of death.
[4:14:16] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> we can kill god tbh
[4:14:18] <+zaddyforever> so was the mimic tear boss fight supposed to be hard? bc i absolutely destroyed mine in the fight

[4:34:01] <%abakkus> that zone name wasting lying, that blood do writhe

[4:35:05] <$SGrim> Awesome!
[4:35:07] <RyuuAoi> Muda muda muda muda muda!
[4:35:08] <%Brassnarwhal> dualblades vibes for sure
[4:35:09] <reasonance> bleed + frost dual daggers would probably be gross
[4:35:11] <%Cozy90> dual daggers are what i used to beat the hardest boss in the game
[4:35:23] <+muetank> Now you just need a spell that give INF poise and you'll carve through dudes like a weed wacker
[4:35:25] <%Brassnarwhal> I don't touch the stuff i play HH and gunlance
[4:35:33] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt go test them on the dragons to the east
[4:35:35] <+zaddyforever> @bluwizard21 int tank seems like it’d be almost too powerful, especially with mimic tears
[4:35:38] <RyuuAoi> Screen clear ha
[4:35:48] <%twohitgood> you need the talisman that heals you with consecutive hits.
[4:35:50] <jubejube56> just need a rocksteady mantle
[4:35:58] <%Brassnarwhal> @muetank the buff from the deathbed lady gives tons of poise doesnt it?
[4:36:02] <%abakkus> walked over an item by the carriage
[4:36:06] <+LandOfTheWay> just gonna ignore that item?
[4:36:14] <+Deadlymuffin5> What level is pat?
[4:36:17] <Kain5707> oh god
[4:36:19] <Kain5707> this place sucks
[4:36:24] <%Bluwizard21> @zaddyforever It really is, especially if you can summon tear before a fight and give it double shields then switch yo your kit
[4:36:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> do it, ignore the item
[4:36:32] <jubejube56> Pat be strong, ignore the item
[4:36:40] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> necessary blood grease cant beat game without it
[4:36:46] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 sucks more with a quarter of pats health bar
[4:36:49] <%baka_sugoi> ayyy

[4:37:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 same
[4:37:22] <%MaybeFalco> you get more golden seeds than you can use
[4:37:23] <%Bluwizard21> @zaddyforever Or if your speedrunner level at menuing, either way mimic tear with double greatshield is unstoppable
[4:37:24] <%Buttlo> One of the funniest things I saw recently was assuming a blood stain on a bridge meant ambush upcoming and then as it turns out they just ran off trying to take in the view.
[4:37:27] <Kain5707> huge mistake @Brassnarwhal LUL
[4:37:30] <sweatch0> are people nice and sociable in the golden capital?
[4:37:33] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 i killed the fat evil but havent found the next boss yet

[4:37:40] <%cade_calrayn> It goes up to +12
[4:37:40] <%Felhad> 14, +12
[4:37:47] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> +12

[4:37:52] <+zaddyforever> @bluwizard21 i’m still working out if i wanna go tanky or if i wanna avoid the grind

[4:38:30] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> you were saying
[4:38:31] <$vehementvadr> crazy talk got you covered
[4:38:41] <%Nobrev> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[4:38:49] <%Bluwizard21> @zaddyforever I had 40 vigor with radagons scourseal and urdtrees favor +2 for like 2k health and I still died in 2-4 hits overall
[4:38:49] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[4:38:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> woof
[4:38:53] <%GreenHerbWhiteSmoke> otg too
[4:38:56] <%MaybeFalco> i was waiting for that to happen with the gargoyle
[4:38:58] <%Cozy90> thats the daggers weakness. low range
[4:38:59] <DracaenaLeaf> that's a whole lotta damage
[4:39:00] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 oof, but also theres no way i can wear that my endurance is like 15, all my stats are in str and faith
[4:39:04] <RyuuAoi> Try lightening?
[4:39:05] <%twistedj3ster> were these the guys who were screwed up in the depths
[4:39:18] <RyuuAoi> Hate those fuckers
[4:39:20] <+burntwing> is it hard to get enough Runes at 152 to level up, or does the scale of enemy drops go up alot?
[4:39:36] <+zaddyforever> @bluwizard21 boss damage is FUCKED in this game, it’s terrifying
[4:39:40] <+Grayhammatter> just appeared from the void i guess
[4:39:45] <Kain5707> @Brassnarwhal you could always respec plus its a cool set and i missed out on it :) very cool indeed
[4:39:46] <bassoontyphoon> @patstaresat is there any drawback to having your lantern lit?
[4:40:12] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 i have 31 str 42 fth 20vig whatever the minimum dex is for tree halberd and 15 end
[4:40:12] <oda_flobunaga> Whic is why Reduvia and the Black Blade both Fuck.  They both have ranged attacks
[4:40:22] <Therusher> I wouldn't worry too much about golden seeds, the game gives you a lot of extras. I have 10 I can't use in first NG cycle.
[4:40:28] <Kain5707> @bassoontyphoon enemies only react to sound as im aware
[4:40:33] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> dude that mimic
[4:40:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @kain5707 but i like 3 shot invaders with my current build
[4:40:57] <ape_hawk> from now on, when someone says they are in a bad place, they mean Caelid
[4:41:02] <%Brassnarwhal> and halberd is pretty easy to roll catch with
[4:41:07] <Kain5707> @Brassnarwhal apparently its only 24 pounds all together Fextralife says its a dex set which is interesting
[4:41:15] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> ew... caelid
[4:41:21] <%Bluwizard21> @zaddyforever yeah but so is your damage if you build even slightly right. Most of my fights were summon mimic drop the magic buff ring throw rannis moon chug wonderflask for unlimited fp then kamehameha the bosses into mulch, generally took 20-30 seconds for any boss as long as i timed it right
[4:41:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> anything cool to the left?
[4:42:08] <jubejube56> Go to the front door, see the boss, then teleport behind the door and never beat them
[4:42:10] <ohno58> fuck that golden order
[4:42:23] <+MisterAvry> "For me it's always like this, Tarnished"
[4:42:23] <%abakkus> wait so normal people cant see the giant tree?

[4:42:49] <+zaddyforever> @bluwizard21 i wanna search for another offensive gravity spell bc stone sling demolishes, but i don’t think there are any
[4:42:56] <sweatch0> flip the switch on the erdtree
[4:42:56] <%cowboy_plague_doctor> it's a ayyyliieeeennnn
[4:42:58] <%justcallmebobplease> From the teleport

[4:46:39] <%MartinOfLoxley> "You'll remember me when I'm banging your mom" - PeachSaliva
[4:46:48] <jubejube56> I think he was possessing that guy that fell down

[4:47:34] <digaogrunge> i think that was the guy who was stepping on his corpse
[4:47:37] <%Brassnarwhal> @zaddyforever i have been considering respeccing to use it cause im str fth and it needs dex
[4:47:37] <Ghufufin> ASSuming direct control
[4:47:38] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt the cinematic announcement trailer that Ranni narrates shows the siege of the Capital, as well as Radahn's fight with Malenia where the Rot exploded
[4:47:41] <%XzileGaming> he was possessing michael douglas?
[4:47:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's actually 3 Scrimblo's in a trenchcoat
[4:47:49] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt you are correct sir
[4:47:52] <Kain5707> Margit is the new persuer
[4:47:55] <%AnthroMetal> @digaogrunge oh shit really?
[4:48:02] <+Edrem> there is a grace/merchant just north west of where you are
[4:48:05] <%cade_calrayn> The front door is sealed, yeah, you're going in the side
[4:48:11] <%TheGuesty> Berserk Sword graveyard
[4:48:20] <it_came_from_outer_space> lol yea
[4:48:20] <%Brassnarwhal> @reallybigrocks pat would know if he read the description of the scrhombus
[4:48:21] <%cade_calrayn> They're the Shattering, Pat
[4:48:28] <%cade_calrayn> Those cutscenes depict the Shattering
[4:48:29] <+PARARScs> aside from radhans
[4:48:29] <it_came_from_outer_space> those were good looking too
[4:48:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt try nighttime here
[4:48:37] <+ReallyBigRocks> you just haven't seen them, you're only 10% through
[4:48:41] <%cade_calrayn> The fight with Malenia and Radahn is how Caelid got covered in Rot
[4:48:46] <%Buttlo> That trailer was what convinced me to care about this game in the first place.
[4:48:49] <+alphonseisbest> yea it kinda sucks that they aren't
[4:48:49] <MartyFun11> You wanna buy that torch
[4:48:53] <%Brassnarwhal> @reallybigrocks mental damage
[4:48:53] <+MisterAvry> what are rune arcs for anyway?
[4:48:58] <+zaddyforever> @brassnarwhal yeah, it’s been the one big thing that’s been making me wanna respecc. rot too, actually
[4:48:59] <Minorou> good torch
[4:49:00] <+Grayhammatter> yep
[4:49:04] <Kain5707> buy the shield
[4:49:06] <%Brassnarwhal> that torch whips ass
[4:49:06] <+ArtemisCroc> they're better embers
[4:49:07] <42nfl19> So what happened to Patches at the very start of the game? I only recall seeing him on like stream 1/2 for Pat
[4:49:15] <Manwad> another sith lord?
[4:49:16] <%cade_calrayn> @ReallyBigRocks the cutscenes are literally showing events *before* the game
[4:49:19] <%MaybeFalco> round 4 lets go
[4:49:19] <%Nobrev> @MisterAvry they activate whichever great rune you have equipped
[4:49:21] <%Brassnarwhal> say it together everyone
[4:49:23] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat if you kill Merchants they ALL drop Bell Bearings - you can turn the Roundtable merchant into the omni-merchant.
[4:49:23] <Sunstalker> Thanks for that margit encounter Pat. I was literally about to miss out on it and the reward
[4:49:27] <%Brassnarwhal> DEATH BIRD

[4:49:48] <Sunstalker> Deathbird up in the graeyard too
[4:49:54] <+Kyma1020> I think it was a neat bait and switch. instead of a traditional cg intro like the Dark Souls, we got a Demon Souls inspired intro instead
[4:50:02] <%Brassnarwhal> can we get that cool sword extend move?
[4:50:04] <RyuuAoi> PAT NEEDS THAT SWORD
[4:50:06] <ohno58> He only takes out his shield to slap you with it
[4:50:11] <Kain5707> how the fuck are you supposed to find this shit

[4:55:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> blew the whole budget on the size, didn't have enough left to make it actually open
[4:55:38] <Sunstalker> Idk what the difference is between golden parry and the improved spell parry one

[4:56:19] <Derpyderpyalltheway> is this the turtoial
[4:56:20] <CheezeWolf> yeah the marker size should be a constant size with regardless of the map zoom
[4:56:28] <+zaddyforever> having nightmares wondering what implied content is secret or what is actually for dlc in this game
[4:56:33] <42nfl19> PARRY THAT MISSLE?
[4:56:37] <reasonance> costs a teeny bit of FP tho
[4:56:42] <Willowight> like against ranged?
[4:56:42] <Augus7717> RANGED PARRY WHAT?!
[4:56:50] <CheezeWolf> sugoinThink
[4:56:50] <Sunstalker> @Brassnarwhal This one Pat is showing and the sorcery one that actually reflects it bacl

[4:57:19] <%Brassnarwhal> @sunstalker i like the one that does summon swords
[4:57:24] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt why do you still carry the torch when you have the lantern?
[4:57:31] <it_came_from_outer_space> lol
[4:57:31] <%TheLemuroid> Ranged parry?
[4:57:38] <%Nobrev> AOE PARRY
[4:57:38] <%twohitgood> ....
[4:57:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[4:57:41] <Omenaire_> how does that even work
[4:57:41] <ohno58> can you parry from across the room now?
[4:57:43] <+stellarseeker> that's so busted
[4:57:43] <+tizziks> test it on the skellys
[4:57:44] <Sunstalker> @42nfl19 torch illuminates more
[4:57:44] <%twohitgood> is that the effective parry range?
[4:57:44] <IvanMistwalker> YO
[4:57:44] <CheezeWolf> lumituLoomzoom
[4:57:45] <+zaddyforever> @42nfl19 that torch is for specific enemies
[4:57:46] <jubejube56> parry of god
[4:57:49] <%Brassnarwhal> @42nfl19 torch is brighter and the new torch reveals invisible assholes
[4:57:51] <%AnthroMetal> that a wide ass parry what
[4:57:52] <Augus7717> AOE PARRY WHA?!
[4:57:56] <+Grayhammatter> how does that even work?
[4:57:57] <%TheLemuroid> This stretches the definition of a parry
[4:57:57] <XxMoliciousxX> spell parry?
[4:58:03] <%twohitgood> gonna be great for hilt parries
[4:58:26] <CheezeWolf> shyyHmm
[4:58:47] <%Bluwizard21> spears are hard to parry
[4:58:51] <+MisterAvry> ehhh
[4:58:54] <Omenaire_> PogChamp
[4:58:55] <+itsKrisD> its real good in pvp
[4:58:55] <+Tredecian> aoe parry
[4:58:57] <%cooldude69xx> obscene
[4:58:57] <%Niney_Who> You can Parry WIFFS with that range
[4:58:58] <ape_hawk> thats super early
[4:58:58] <Xelhesia> THATS FILTY
[4:58:58] <senfood> oh my god does that work on bosses
[4:59:01] <Augus7717> OH MY GOD
[4:59:03] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> just an aoe parry

[4:59:11] <+zaddyforever> HOLY
[4:59:13] <%Brassnarwhal> oh fuck off with that
[4:59:13] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> nothing weird here
[4:59:15] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @senfood Most bosses CAN be parried, so probably.
[4:59:15] <RyuuAoi> Very exact
[4:59:17] <%cade_calrayn> that's VILE
[4:59:18] <%AnthroMetal> oh my god that's stupid
[4:59:18] <ianabstract> this makes wiffing with a big sword so dangerous
[4:59:19] <+Grayhammatter> that's disgusting
[4:59:19] <jubejube56> looks like you can parry outside of range where you can get hit?
[4:59:22] <senfood> THIS IS OBSCENE
[4:59:22] <ianabstract> in pvp
[4:59:22] <%AnthroMetal> what the shit
[4:59:32] <+zaddyforever> this in pvp would be maddening

[5:09:13] <jubejube56> It always has to be tree sentinels
[5:09:19] <+Ravenian96> This is a great place to invade fyi, tons of people focus on killing this dude with a partner
[5:09:21] <+zaddyforever> this guy was actually super easy for me
[5:09:21] <+MisterAvry> EZPZ
[5:09:23] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Did that guy look familiar at all Pat?

[5:10:39] <Sunstalker> Oh, it's safe Pat.
[5:10:41] <%luftraumm1> pat's stomping the game
[5:10:41] <oda_flobunaga> Yep

[5:10:56] <%boggsz12> oh shit
[5:10:57] <oda_flobunaga> yep
[5:11:00] <Sunstalker> It brings you to a spot you can't do something at yet
[5:11:01] <%cade_calrayn> It's when you were granted access to the plateau, Pat
[5:11:04] <%AyotoCorp> That probably turned on as soon as you hit the plateau
[5:11:08] <%maskofmichael> The Stargate
[5:11:11] <JossyJoestar> Yeah think its based on story when this appears
[5:11:14] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt it goes to a divine tower
[5:11:17] <dan_g_v> gogogo
[5:11:18] <+Ravenian96> pretty useless for now
[5:11:19] <VidulaSaix> Yeah it's a big nothing for now
[5:11:24] <%boggsz12> what the fuck
[5:11:24] <+Edrem> nah turns on when you get inside the capital
[5:11:26] <%sniffy77> where the hell are you
[5:11:26] <+mecha_11> So how much grinding are you guys doing in this game?

[5:11:55] <Augus7717> look east @PatStaresAt

[5:11:59] <VidulaSaix> 153
[5:12:00] <+ReallyBigRocks> porgess
[5:12:04] <%Kevlar_Caviar> rykard time?
[5:12:11] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt But yeah that Tree Sentinel you just fought was Havel (Elden ring flavored). He had the Dragon hammer, a huge rock shield, the same sorta Ribbed armor but in Gold, and the Helmet.

[5:12:56] <%cade_calrayn> @Ravenian96 ah it's Malenia's
[5:13:00] <%luftraumm1> hes gonna be ungodly overleveld for most things
[5:13:05] <VidulaSaix> @Dustin_Gunn Bro he's 153. He's already like 40 levels above what's recommended for the final boss LUL

[5:13:29] <+LandOfTheWay> oh, hey mildred

[5:13:49] <Xelhesia> LUL this shield
[5:13:49] <ergulor> that's just mean
[5:13:51] <+mecha_11> The way I've been playing I haven't been grinding. I usually just wander around until something happens and I acquire runes naturally.
[5:13:51] <JossyJoestar> TBH you still get two tapped by bosses in the later stretch even at level 150
[5:13:52] <+Jeshk0> welp
[5:13:52] <+FlappySeal_> jesus christ

[5:14:21] <$SGrim> When you hit enemies, they're toast
[5:14:23] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I beat the game at 180 without farming souls
[5:14:30] <%JoshManVGH> Oh she ate some grapes, if you know what I'm sayin!

[5:14:43] <42nfl19> But @PatStaresAt ...does the ladder go down as well?
[5:14:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> get this tho, ladder also go down
[5:14:54] <+zaddyforever> @mecha_11 same, i only grind when i need like some runes for a level so i don’t waste even more runes before doing a boss
[5:14:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Sometimes they also go down
[5:14:59] <%LaughingCatt> @Dustin_Gunn the power of grind
[5:14:59] <Derpyderpyalltheway> SNAKEEATER
[5:15:02] <+ZooRaggy> I beat it at 140, I sprinted through some of the endgame areas tho, just too many enemies
[5:15:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> i didn't believe it either
[5:15:09] <+hakumaribo> man i dont know how to progress in this area im in.
[5:15:09] <%maskofmichael> your at the top of the ladder
[5:15:13] <hermitdab> o it do go down
[5:15:14] <Wakerz140> No, this is normal progression
[5:15:18] <JossyJoestar> I got lost on this mountian for hours
[5:15:19] <$drabberfaun535> I have max vit and i get three tapped by later bosses. never want to do the bleed swamp again
[5:15:19] <rekinom> Pat did a little grinding off screen, as he is wont to do
[5:15:19] <$vehementvadr> the latter doesn't actually move
[5:15:27] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt if you had kept going, you'd hit the end of a bridge and something else off to the left
[5:15:30] <+Ravenian96> Playing co-op to help beat later bosses, I win about 1 in 10 of my fights, and the host always get 1 shot
[5:15:38] <Nosphomet> noooooo!

[5:16:48] <Ner234> Free the Gief
[5:16:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> good times
[5:16:50] <+zaddyforever> shame break
[5:17:20] <+zaddyforever> so many builds to try, so few larval tears
[5:17:33] <+zaddyforever> my mind goblins are keeping me from touching respeccs
[5:17:39] <NewWillinium> Sooo. . .Malenia is a fuck of a boss fight. Surprisingly it's her second phase that's the problem. Just. . .Dear gods.
[5:17:56] <+Ravenian96> just moonveil mimic spam
[5:18:03] <+Ravenian96> 4Head
[5:18:09] <%Fenrisulfr_V> I tried respeccing while I was tired once, from Faith into Int, and put the points back into Faith three times in a row instead of moving them to Int.
[5:18:10] <jschmoney99> anyone know where to use the larval tears to Respec?
[5:18:16] <NewWillinium> Shame break? Did I miss Pat dying again when I went to get a water?
[5:18:22] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @jschmoney99 2nd Shardbearer
[5:18:34] <NewWillinium> @Ravenian96 I'm seriously tempted. I *just* got it to plus 10.
[5:18:52] <+Ravenian96> yeah you perma stun her, it's super easy
[5:18:55] <+zaddyforever> @newwillinium he jumped off where a ladder was and died
[5:18:55] <NewWillinium> @jschmoney99 At the top of the Academy in Luneria. Where you fight the boss.
[5:18:58] <+Grayhammatter> @NewWillinium he fell off a cliff
[5:19:00] <+Verdantree> @jschmoney99 Place where you beat the second 'main' boss
[5:19:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> he forgot ladders go down too
[5:19:33] <NewWillinium> *Laughs*  Okay that's pretty great.
[5:19:53] <jschmoney99> awesome, thanks all who answered 🙏🏻
[5:20:17] <+zaddyforever> @newwillinium he didn’t even actually acknowledge the death, just sat silently, said the area looked nice, and said he had to take the gief out
[5:20:26] <+Ravenian96> equip heaviest goat dude armor with pot jar talisman that increases load, dual wield katanta's with moonveil in main hand and just spam the r2 weapon art
[5:20:31] <+Videodragon64> where are larvl tears?
[5:20:49] <NewWillinium> Thanks for the advice y'all.
[5:20:54] <bassoontyphoon> @videodragon64 in orbs
[5:21:08] <%cade_calrayn> Yeah they should've shown them in the opening
[5:21:13] <%BinaryFireball> hmmmm
[5:21:15] <+alphonseisbest> I hope it gets patched back in
[5:21:22] <VidulaSaix> It definitely is odd that the cutscene isnt here
[5:21:27] <+Videodragon64> lol where are orbs?
[5:21:28] <senfood> More like it feels like stuff that's going to show up more in DLC.
[5:21:37] <%JoshManVGH> DLC makes sense now!
[5:21:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> u just gotta find the time machine
[5:21:53] <+Ravenian96> DLC gonna be time travel?
[5:22:02] <+zaddyforever> @videodragon64 the item you use to respecc, if you find them, the description explains them if you find them
[5:22:10] <Gamer76255> Better than Barricade?
[5:22:19] <%LaughingCatt> but we desire MOAR, Pat
[5:22:22] <VidulaSaix> DLC for this would dead ass be a new continent LUL
[5:22:26] <VidulaSaix> Or just mroe underground shit
[5:22:28] <+Verdantree> Hey Pat! What's your build looking like?
[5:22:31] <+alphonseisbest> nah we NEED a sky level
[5:22:32] <ape_hawk> i want to go to space in this universe
[5:22:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> what if game bigger
[5:22:32] <+Edrem> they might do sekiro style updates and add in boss rush
[5:22:33] <%JoshManVGH> It absolutly does NOT need it. But if it's that cool story stuff then why not
[5:22:33] <+stellarseeker> DLC HAS to be space
[5:22:34] <+Ravenian96> I wouldn't complain about more content for the best game created in a decade
[5:22:35] <Omenaire_> theyll probably do it though
[5:22:35] <krampus2> what would you want in dlc
[5:22:37] <%BinaryFireball> I... I weirdly disagree. I want more
[5:22:38] <+Jeshk0> DLC will just be those cutscenes they didnt finish
[5:22:39] <+zaddyforever> i can’t comprehend what the dlc would be
[5:22:39] <ape_hawk> S P A C E
[5:22:40] <NewWillinium> I think it's because DLC is basically expected at this point.
[5:22:41] <+Videodragon64> not if but WHERE is one?
[5:22:44] <%Cozy90> FUCK YEAH
[5:22:45] <%D00msDayDan> yharnam DLC
[5:22:46] <%JoshManVGH> MOONS HAUNTED
[5:22:48] <$SGrim> Nice
[5:22:49] <senfood> Bruh, you would be surprised. The game is definitely massive as hell but still.
[5:22:50] <Manwad> THE MOON
[5:22:50] <%cade_calrayn> Nothing in the cutscenes lead itself to DLC, they all get covered in item descriptions and the boss fights
[5:22:51] <Xelhesia> THE FLOATING CONTINENT
[5:22:52] <%OrangeMDT> Take some of the game out for dlc
[5:22:52] <+PR0swagonist> just drop all the dark souls games
[5:22:52] <kingra> BASED
[5:22:52] <+AyupaPupa> space lordran
[5:22:55] <+zaddyforever> like it feels so complete but also NEED MORE
[5:22:55] <+Grayhammatter> the whole thing PogChMP
[5:22:56] <digaogrunge> Glider DLC
[5:22:57] <%ScreamLord> Do you have a password for that once Multiplayer thing that lets messages and stuff from people that share it guaranteed to show up in your game?
[5:22:58] <+alphonseisbest> but what if  BIGGER THO
[5:23:01] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt These are the lands between, marika is from the neuman lands. there are a lot of other lands
[5:23:01] <jubejube56> Very true, what this game needs is a battle pass
[5:23:01] <%greasypete00> back in time to during the shattering maybe?
[5:23:02] <jman13131313> space
[5:23:02] <digaogrunge> Horse DLC
[5:23:02] <jschmoney99> new dlc adds hard mode
[5:23:03] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> The Kill Yarnham DLC
[5:23:06] <%Dustin_Gunn> sekiro needed dlc that game was short as hell
[5:23:15] <VidulaSaix> Tarnished Must Die mode
[5:23:20] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There are some parts that 100% feel like some set up for the dlc
[5:23:23] <+stellarseeker> @PatStaresAt No, they're eating corpses
[5:23:23] <%Brassnarwhal> no they'll put in the trilogy for the anniversary edition @patstaresat
[5:23:26] <XxMoliciousxX> they got tired after a long march
[5:23:35] <VidulaSaix> OhMyDog
[5:23:38] <+Ravenian96> They are literally eating their bros
[5:23:50] <+tizziks> Anyone figure out what is with the wolves and wind?
[5:23:51] <+ReallyBigRocks> this is a little happy house :)
[5:23:53] <TwistParabola> here we go boys and girls
[5:23:53] <+zaddyforever> yeah, the implication that there’s a larger goddess of rot feels like dlc bits
[5:23:55] <Ghostduck01> OhMyDog
[5:23:59] <%Solarint> isnt it amazing when games aren't cut up for day 1 dlc and pre-order bonuses.
[5:24:01] <niffinbox> bloodbornagain dlc

[5:25:47] <%JoshManVGH> These Heroes Graves ate fucking something else
[5:25:52] <Midnight188> Executioner's Chariot 2!
[5:25:52] <ergulor> skeleton wall
[5:25:53] <haisho> that isn't even a ball
[5:25:56] <Sunstalker> Pat, want you to know these can't be destroyed.
[5:26:01] <jschmoney99> how many runes to level up cuz 100000 is a lot to be walkin around with
[5:26:12] <Augus7717> you can survive the chariot with enough HP but it takes a lot @patstaresat
[5:26:14] <+Ravenian96> truly marvels of engineering
[5:26:37] <VidulaSaix> I use the Divine SHiled from Flash to survive it
[5:26:40] <ExpressNode> He's at max though right?
[5:26:43] <VidulaSaix> Flask*
[5:26:55] <%abakkus> god those things stress me out so bad
[5:26:55] <+Ravenian96> think you need at least 44 vigor lmao
[5:27:02] <%cade_calrayn> @ExpressNode there is no max HP lol
[5:27:02] <NBUsagi> I mean it is called Volcano Mountain
[5:27:03] <Ricee> oh god gelmir's hero grave
[5:27:04] <jacksawjack> Welcome to New Jersey
[5:27:05] <%cade_calrayn> not in this game
[5:27:08] <NBUsagi> or well the Volcano Manor
[5:27:21] <+PR0swagonist> Its Bowser's castle
[5:27:47] <%luftraumm1> you are not used to the parry
[5:27:57] <Tenebrae94> i thought you didn't parry pat
[5:28:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> that dude got owned
[5:28:12] <Ricee> yeah I think parry is easier
[5:28:15] <+Ravenian96> this games parry is kinda obsolete
[5:28:25] <%greasypete00> feels more like ds1 than ds3
[5:28:35] <jacksawjack> or licking the remnants of the condiments she covered herself in.
[5:28:36] <%twohitgood> was just about to say "it feels like ds1 parry"
[5:28:36] <ExpressNode> @cade_calrayn Oh I meant the soft cap
[5:28:37] <%Fenrisulfr_V> In exchange for the parry being easier, a lot of bosses require multi-parries.
[5:28:37] <Ricee> yeah def closer to DS1 than DS3
[5:28:46] <%greasypete00> its not as predictive as ds2 and 3
[5:28:55] <%luftraumm1> you'd have to explin that further
[5:29:01] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[5:29:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[5:29:04] <%Solarint> F
[5:29:05] <%BlueLunecy> Miss it?
[5:29:05] <Ricee> sekiro's was really easy
[5:29:05] <%Deft_Thought> LUL
[5:29:07] <TwistParabola> F
[5:29:07] <Ricee> :)
[5:29:12] <+TheMuuj> BB parry was the only one I could do reliably
[5:29:14] <$vehementvadr> parry the chariot
[5:29:17] <Midnight188> someone forgot
[5:29:21] <$vehementvadr> no balls
[5:29:22] <%greasypete00> ds1 and des are reactive
[5:29:26] <jacksawjack> Opaline bubble tear can save you from one hit from the thing
[5:29:27] <%BinaryFireball> ER feels nicer to a parry noob like me
[5:29:30] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> frame delays on parries feels like shit
[5:29:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> I unironically love this dungeon
[5:30:21] <42nfl19> this place seems like it SUCKS
[5:30:24] <jacksawjack> Parrying only works for hackers in DS2 and #
[5:30:25] <Strigiform> yes
[5:30:26] <%BinaryFireball> I always hated that I never knew what the parry system wanted from me
[5:30:26] <jacksawjack> 3
[5:30:28] <%ScreamLord> Probably
[5:30:36] <%VHGS> oh yeah lol
[5:30:36] <TwistParabola> i dont remember, maybe
[5:30:37] <Ricee> this dungeon took me at least an hour or 2 to beat
[5:30:43] <Zourath> There super is
[5:30:47] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt Even though parries are easier, certain bosses, like Bell Bearing Hunter or the Godskin, require two or more parries in a row to be able to riposte them.
[5:30:50] <Ricee> LMAOO
[5:31:01] <Notterr> ROLL
[5:31:03] <milky_toasty> cool skullface pat
[5:31:04] <%Solarint> UH OH
[5:31:05] <TwistParabola> dagger quickstep
[5:31:06] <%Valdorick> Try a quickstep dagger
[5:31:06] <%ScreamLord> You sure?
[5:31:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> no way
[5:31:08] <%cade_calrayn> Wait for it
[5:31:11] <+Grayhammatter> are you sure?
[5:31:11] <%Solarint> oh you good
[5:31:13] <42nfl19> why is pat so tough?
[5:31:17] <Notterr> roll is quicker then walking in lava
[5:31:17] <%greasypete00> wow interesting
[5:31:19] <+zaddyforever> use the ancient quickstep arts
[5:31:20] <Ricee> yeah quickstep gets you through these
[5:31:22] <haisho> how odd
[5:31:23] <jacksawjack> I wish you could kill them
[5:31:24] <+EntireJewishPopulation> *opens stream* oh pat is in hell
[5:31:25] <%sniffy77> god i wish it would of just kept going
[5:31:27] <%Valdorick> Man, thank GOD Durability isn't in the game anymore
[5:31:28] <Strigiform> tough strong boy needs no quickstep
[5:31:28] <ape_hawk> just casually strolling through lava

[5:33:51] <+zaddyforever> @dew217 yeah, i’m 67 hours in and haven’t seen the full map yet
[5:33:53] <42nfl19> DOGGO NOOOO
[5:33:55] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt What does the Sif Say/
[5:33:55] <%Solarint> LMFAO
[5:33:56] <+wizard_of_diamonds> NICE
[5:33:58] <oda_flobunaga> ?
[5:33:58] <ammobasket> PUMPED
[5:33:59] <+FlappySeal_> this is my favourite pokemon dlc
[5:34:03] <NBUsagi> are the Bloodhound Knights wolf people too?
[5:34:04] <%Solarint> I looked away for a minute and it was dead
[5:34:08] <%ScreamLord> Really feels like some of the bosses should level with you
[5:34:09] <TwistParabola> read the description on that one
[5:34:13] <oda_flobunaga> It took me 140 hours to complete the map
[5:34:16] <%Agami23> bloodhound knight is pretty good because of bleed
[5:34:16] <jacksawjack> In Soviet Lands Between, Shit eats you.
[5:34:18] <%Valdorick> Oh, UI tip - Spirit Summons with Red Eyes have MASSIVE aggro range
[5:34:20] <%Foostini> Cheer500 pat
[5:34:25] <%boggsz12> yeah the bloodhound knight armor is in there iirc
[5:34:27] <+zaddyforever> pat absolutely shits on these bosses
[5:34:29] <XxMoliciousxX> blood artoris?
[5:34:33] <%Valdorick> Namely, with Red Eyes on the icon
[5:34:34] <+Ravenian96> Level doesn't matter, I'm going through the game stuck at level 60 and the summons turbo shit on everything
[5:34:39] <%Foostini> I don't know how this twitch shit works
[5:35:02] <%greasypete00> what does golden parry actually do
[5:35:12] <%justcallmebobplease> I bet Paige would LOVE your character
[5:35:12] <+ajeanstarks78 > a whole new meaning to giving one's enemy the finger.
[5:35:24] <Sunstalker> and it costs a decent chunk of fp
[5:35:25] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Wait what
[5:35:28] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What is this!?
[5:35:30] <$drabberfaun535> its ok guys the rune bosses will make up the boss debt
[5:35:32] <%greasypete00> holy shit thats cool
[5:35:33] <42nfl19> Does it affect the timing? I saw you missing a lot @PatStaresAt
[5:35:33] <+zaddyforever> @screamlord that would work until the endgame bosses who are absolutely destructive, or the trio bosses
[5:35:34] <stormhawk9891> BEEG parry
[5:35:37] <%luftraumm1> a tiny bit
[5:35:44] <hermitdab> did some invasions today and holy moly do you see some wacky and broken shit... its awesome
[5:35:47] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> womp
[5:35:49] <Sunstalker> Pat, try out the sentinel shield's skill, if you can wield it
[5:35:58] <jacksawjack> It's Wooly Hole of parrying.
[5:36:33] <%abakkus> CLENCH IS REAL
[5:36:37] <+Grayhammatter> jesus christ
[5:36:43] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> can you put the buckler parry ash on medium shields?
[5:36:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> this shit is so good
[5:36:55] <%luftraumm1> watch out for the pages
[5:36:55] <EvelinaLoveaux> did pat do the volcano manor boss yet?
[5:37:00] <%Dew217> I am thoroughly clenched
[5:37:01] <Ricee> buckler parry is the same as a normal parry
[5:37:03] <%ScreamLord> SO little it @zaddyforever True, but it feels wrong too fight a boss and just rip them in half with 1-2 hits
[5:37:08] <%luftraumm1> buckler parry is quicker i think?
[5:37:17] <+Panic_at_the_Discord> buckler parry is an ash of war like golden parry
[5:37:17] <%MaybeFalco> fun fact if your health is high enough you can survive getting hit by the chariot
[5:37:24] <leaplearning> bloodborne enemy
[5:37:25] <+zaddyforever> @evelinaloveaux nope, he’s barely even walked into gelmir
[5:37:27] <+alphonseisbest> @panic_at_the_discord not that I've seen
[5:37:28] <Ricee> oh god
[5:37:36] <%luftraumm1> corner
[5:37:39] <%Valdorick> Good job, you're trapped.
[5:37:41] <Ricee> LMAOO
[5:37:43] <%luftraumm1> oh my god my asshole
[5:37:44] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:37:47] <ReenBenkyou> lol
[5:37:47] <Yakobro> LUL
[5:37:48] <Sunstalker> Parry is parry, it's the type of weapon it's on that effects the window
[5:37:51] <%Cozy90> oh shit new RLM today
[5:37:51] <+cognitohazardous> crazy talk
[5:37:53] <ape_hawk> crazy talk
[5:37:53] <%Dew217> CLENCHED
[5:37:53] <TwistParabola> yeah
[5:37:57] <jacksawjack> Opaline Bubble Tear
[5:37:57] <%ScreamLord> @zaddyforever ignore that those first 3 words, I started writting one thing and forgot to delete it
[5:38:01] <EvelinaLoveaux> @zaddyforever ah okay, i just finished up that fight and wanted to see his reaction if he had done it
[5:38:03] <hermitdab> you can jump it but the timing gotta be perfect and you running downhill
[5:38:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> you might be able to roll through it bud idk
[5:38:13] <Ricee> carian retaliation is amazing in PvP
[5:38:18] <%ElkRiverDog> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[5:38:21] <Sunstalker> Thops is just a worse one
[5:38:24] <jacksawjack> Twiggy tear as well for this shithole
[5:38:34] <Ricee> naw Thops is good cuz it parries physicals too
[5:38:36] <+LandOfTheWay> @Cozy90 the picard-ening continues
[5:38:54] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Hey if Pat drank that one hit juice could he survive the Rolling Chariot
[5:39:02] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt dude, how the fuck did you beat that boss fight with 3 crystal guys?
[5:39:05] <%greasypete00> probably costs fp when you hit the parry
[5:39:18] <+zaddyforever> @screamlord ig the tradeoff is that even the bosses you can demolish usually have some move that’ll unfair if it hits
[5:39:32] <Ricee> @Dakuu75 do poise damage, if they stagger they die easy
[5:39:40] <%luftraumm1> frames!
[5:39:42] <%Solarint> holy shit that was close
[5:39:56] <UnImprest> I used the mist spell
[5:40:05] <Khester824> just lure the 2 crystalist away from the mage one
[5:40:09] <%luftraumm1> the invuln frames saved you there, the skelly in the nook died
[5:40:15] <+wizard_of_diamonds> I thought that parry worked with spells
[5:40:16] <+Ravenian96> Elden Ring dlc just adds a pvp area for your summons like a pokemon arena
[5:40:22] <NBUsagi> So pat is runng Str/Faith ?
[5:40:25] <Ricee> ah but you just won't get the swords
[5:40:28] <%luftraumm1> you could
[5:40:35] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> There right there
[5:40:50] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> They werent far pat lol
[5:40:51] <%Dew217> Pat its over 100k
[5:40:52] <Ricee> the magic parry is good cuz you still get the sword even if you don't perfect parry
[5:41:08] <%notsoy> lol
[5:41:11] <%YakumoYomi> psaOno
[5:41:13] <TwistParabola> you got hit anyway
[5:41:14] <%luftraumm1> well gone now
[5:41:20] <42nfl19> is that a side  platform drop? in the holes?
[5:41:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> but Pat you could be level 154
[5:41:21] <jacksawjack> There's the insta-death laval
[5:41:22] <rudiciuscaesar> Man, I just came in to see the YOU DIED, that was a nice intro.
[5:41:27] <haisho> it's fine he got a farming spot
[5:41:28] <hermitdab> triggering some runeboys up in here
[5:41:29] <Midnight188> Pat loves playing with the edge of cliffs
[5:41:34] <jacksawjack> probably not
[5:41:37] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Dew217 Not any more lol
[5:41:40] <Ner234> He's level 152 LUL He doesn't need them
[5:41:42] <%twistedj3ster> great, now WE'VE got the goblins
[5:41:47] <Sunstalker> Bloodhound armor and Gelmir Knight
[5:41:51] <jacksawjack> the tomb literally gave you the finger
[5:41:52] <%YakumoYomi> Have you been to a place that DIDN'T have cool ass shit in this game?
[5:42:03] <+mecha_11> Can you use iframes on the skeleton roly thing?
[5:42:03] <Wakerz140> One of my favorite armor sets in the game is here
[5:42:13] <ArgentUndaCova> Whereabouts is that fight with the Putrid Crystalians that Pat struggled with? I completely missed that dungeon
[5:42:17] <%Dew217> 152??!!?! My  Erdrich Lords thats awesoem
[5:42:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> I think theres a cemetery shade boss hiding in here
[5:42:26] <+alphonseisbest> hey any thought on the reusage of bosses, cuz I've seen the red dog boss 4 times now and it kinda a bit much. but what do u think about it?
[5:42:29] <%Valdorick> There's 2 great armor sets here, in the same room even!
[5:42:33] <%ScreamLord> Which set?
[5:42:36] <NewWillinium> @ArgentUndaCova Just North of the Sorcery Village in Caelid
[5:42:49] <ArgentUndaCova> @NewWillinium Awesome, thanks!
[5:42:52] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat is physically incapable of passing up on challenge-based new outfits for his dolls.
[5:42:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> DAMN
[5:43:02] <+wizard_of_diamonds> THE SHADE
[5:43:06] <%Solarint> the fuck is that
[5:43:06] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Got I hate that mob
[5:43:08] <+Grayhammatter> excuse me?!
[5:43:08] <%Dustin_Gunn> there's a place here where you pick up a swordstone key and you're just stuck behind the charriot with no chance to live
[5:43:09] <+seaearthandsky> what the fuck was that
[5:43:09] <TwistParabola> HOLLOW KNIGHT
[5:43:12] <rudiciuscaesar> random boss just there lmao
[5:43:13] <%Valdorick> Oh look, its that thing that's normally a boss
[5:43:13] <wyldcarde> SeemsGood
[5:43:17] <Wakerz140> I think it's this dungeon at least
[5:43:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> i gotta go back and fight that guy
[5:43:20] <+Ravenian96> just think of reused bosses as normal enemies plucked from late game areas
[5:43:22] <NBUsagi> Ooft, i clenched on that one
[5:43:34] <%boggsz12> now go left and under
[5:43:34] <NewWillinium> There's a drop to your left.
[5:43:35] <rudiciuscaesar> I like the ambient music here
[5:43:38] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There's a drop on that narrow part.
[5:43:49] <NewWillinium> Yeah no nothing here but death
[5:43:50] <ArgentUndaCova> Wtf D:
[5:43:50] <%boggsz12> this is not what you have to do but ok
[5:43:51] <Ricee> there's a better solution to this
[5:43:53] <TwistParabola> you forgot the drop
[5:43:54] <NBUsagi> This cant be the way
[5:43:55] <Zourath> Not that way, go back
[5:43:55] <%Valdorick> Drop to your left, Pat, off the edge and into the pit
[5:43:56] <Sunstalker> Put on a dashing art of war @PatStaresAt
[5:43:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Use the one hit potion lol
[5:43:57] <+wizard_of_diamonds> You gotta stand in lava to be safe Kappa
[5:43:58] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> quickstep dagger solves this one
[5:43:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah don't bother with this
[5:44:00] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Quickstep
[5:44:03] <wyldcarde> I'm not doing this
[5:44:05] <TwistParabola> he dead
[5:44:06] <%boggsz12> there might be something down here i dunno
[5:44:07] <+zaddyforever> QUICKSTEP
[5:44:08] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt There's a much easier way to do this
[5:44:13] <rudiciuscaesar> can you jump out of the lava faster?
[5:44:14] <Zourath> This just leads back to the boss
[5:44:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis
[5:44:16] <%Bluwizard21> he does know he can ride them right?
[5:44:17] <zhenthrim213> wht the hell is this place
[5:44:18] <%Valdorick> Pat, you're skipping the armor again
[5:44:20] <%Dustin_Gunn> this is intended?!
[5:44:20] <wyldcarde> @screamlord good point
[5:44:25] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[5:44:26] <rudiciuscaesar> WOAH
[5:44:27] <%Solarint> rip
[5:44:30] <Ricee> @Dustin_Gunn not at all lol
[5:44:30] <rudiciuscaesar> that just grazed Pat
[5:44:30] <Sunstalker> @PatStaresAt The expected way here is a shortcut OR jumping ontop that chariot from a drop
[5:44:31] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> you bent on doing it this way?
[5:44:32] <%boggsz12> yep
[5:44:33] <+Artemis_Scowl> LUL
[5:44:35] <haisho> oops
[5:44:36] <%Valdorick> The Easier way is the way to the armor
[5:44:39] <%MaybeFalco> LUL
[5:44:39] <+alphonseisbest> hey any thought on the reusage of bosses, cuz I've seen the red dog boss 4 times now and it kinda a bit much. but what do u think about it? @patstaresat
[5:44:40] <%watts121> @Dustin_Gunn nah there is a secret to this place
[5:44:43] <digaogrunge> This is not the way to do this
[5:44:43] <+mecha_11> QUICKSTEP
[5:44:43] <Paperware> yeah, the hitbox on those things kinda suck
[5:44:47] <Ricee> yeah the chariot is missing a statue on the middle
[5:44:47] <Giztech> fall down to that little ledge
[5:44:48] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt There's a drop on the narrow part of the 2nd chariot.
[5:44:49] <%watts121> but you can brute force it
[5:44:50] <%sniffy77> oh yeah that was in a trailer
[5:44:50] <Ricee> so it's flat on top
[5:44:50] <%cade_calrayn> There's a way above them
[5:44:54] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yep, ride that bitch
[5:44:55] <%boggsz12> when you're in that little alcove with the cemetary shafe go left under the path that the chariot is on
[5:44:55] <zhenthrim213> YOU CAN DO THT
[5:44:55] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[5:44:56] <rudiciuscaesar> when it pauses to turn around? Does he not have a hitbox then?
[5:44:56] <+Verdantree> i had to look this up
[5:44:57] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> it was in the trailer too
[5:44:57] <+SaintSalted> theres no way
[5:44:57] <+muetank> You got a dagger with quickstep?
[5:45:00] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I think people are confusing the dungeons
[5:45:00] <Wakerz140> There's a drop and you can ride specific ones
[5:45:03] <TwistParabola> just, go to that place you can drop to the side
[5:45:04] <%cade_calrayn> you'll find it if you explore the rooms
[5:45:06] <Ricee> only on this one
[5:45:06] <%watts121> you can brute force it with quickstep
[5:45:07] <+NeonFishFace> no fucking way
[5:45:08] <Sunstalker> So the first lava stream, pat. Duck into the corner at the end, also an area around it's corner. Chairot won't follow
[5:45:10] <+alphonseisbest> through the middle
[5:45:11] <jacksawjack> New Mihazachi Special, Poison Rotting Blood Lava
[5:45:11] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> when you see the shade kill it
[5:45:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> you can drop on top of it
[5:45:18] <%Dustin_Gunn> @alphonseisbest Is there any open world game with more variety than elden ring though?
[5:45:24] <rudiciuscaesar> this chariot here has a stone rider on it, do they all?
[5:45:26] <+CoogiDown2MySocks> then look at the overhang that you pass before it
[5:45:32] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I call  bullshit
[5:45:36] <Ricee> this one does, not that one @rudiciuscaesar
[5:45:37] <%cade_calrayn> @rudiciuscaesar the final one doesn't
[5:45:39] <+alphonseisbest> @dusoooh good point there
[5:45:44] <Ricee> the one he's supposed to jump on is missing the statue on it
[5:45:48] <TwistParabola> there is something down there in those pits to the side
[5:45:50] <%cade_calrayn> It's not bullshit, I've done it before
[5:45:56] <rudiciuscaesar> so the one that doesn't, Pat could jump on it?
[5:46:00] <Wakerz140> I was mistakenly thinking of a different dungeon, still some cool stuff here though
[5:46:03] <%Dew217> Pats making the mother of all omelettes here
[5:46:07] <%boggsz12> there's a path underneath where the second chariot is going that you can drop down to from where the cemetary shade is
[5:46:08] <Ricee> @rudiciuscaesar there's a route that takes you above it
[5:46:10] <%Kouseo> that hole u saw is where u drop down
[5:46:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> drop off the bridge here
[5:46:17] <NewWillinium> You'll get to drop down on top of it
[5:46:20] <TwistParabola> drop off the sides
[5:46:22] <%watts121> go down this hole
[5:46:23] <+alphonseisbest> Jump through the middle
[5:46:27] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt There is a drop if you explore fully
[5:46:35] <Sunstalker> Just go to the end of this first hallway. It won't won't go down the lava this one
[5:46:35] <%boggsz12> did you see it?
[5:46:36] <digaogrunge> You fall on top of it
[5:46:40] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt there's a ladder in a room nearby that leads to rafters and you can drop down on top of one
[5:46:40] <ArgentUndaCova> Goddamn that hitbox on the chariot mopUgh
[5:46:47] <rudiciuscaesar> not even while it's rushing upwards? Like if Pat jumped, it would be in motion and just ice him?
[5:46:49] <partyshart> what is left in the dungeon to get?
[5:46:59] <Ricee> @Sunstalker you're late, he's already done that
[5:47:00] <%cade_calrayn> He already did the "go-past the first one" route
[5:47:32] <Ricee> imagine how many invisible walls haven't been found yet in this world
[5:47:50] <+Grayhammatter> yo?!
[5:47:50] <NBUsagi> LUCKY TED
[5:47:51] <%cade_calrayn> WHAT
[5:47:51] <rudiciuscaesar> ohhhhh
[5:47:55] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> OH SHIT
[5:47:55] <%Valdorick> Behind you is a window

[5:47:57] <Giztech> look up
[5:48:02] <%sniffy77> X marks the spot
[5:48:03] <%cade_calrayn> Look around Pat, there's a window
[5:48:05] <TwistParabola> look up
[5:48:06] <%Valdorick> Do NOT get on the Chariot
[5:48:09] <NewWillinium> Alright skipped the Armor, but this is where you drop on top of the Chariot.
[5:48:10] <Sunstalker> @Ricee the armor's through there though?
[5:48:11] <Ricee> LUL
[5:48:11] <+Grayhammatter> welp
[5:48:12] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[5:48:13] <%abakkus> waynerF
[5:48:15] <hermitdab> sick
[5:48:15] <Omenaire_> LUL LUL LUL
[5:48:16] <+Joller2> LUL
[5:48:16] <+Ravenian96> just killed radahn before he could launch into his second phase at level 60 with a +6 moonveil no summons
[5:48:17] <%Valdorick> You were almost cool
[5:48:17] <%baka_sugoi> womp womp
[5:48:17] <Ghostduck01> LUL
[5:48:17] <TwistParabola> F
[5:48:18] <%watts121> if you do it this way you miss armor
[5:48:20] <oda_flobunaga> DA NAN NANANANANA
[5:48:20] <NBUsagi> At least now you know what ot do
[5:48:20] <rudiciuscaesar> lmao
[5:48:20] <NewWillinium> Takes you right to the boss room
[5:48:21] <%cade_calrayn> We didn't say *go in* the window lol
[5:48:21] <$vehementvadr> ass
[5:48:23] <hermitdab> dig up
[5:48:24] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> OH SNAP lol
[5:48:25] <+fromnibelheim> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[5:48:25] <Ricee> that window is where the armor is
[5:48:26] <haisho> landed wrong LUL
[5:48:26] <thewrathofscience> LUL
[5:48:27] <digaogrunge> why
[5:48:29] <Berendenn> the armor was in there
[5:48:29] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[5:48:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> there's a ledge above where you landed
[5:48:33] <%Valdorick> The armor is in that side path
[5:48:33] <TwistParabola> in that window you were jumping onto
[5:48:35] <+textandnumbers> graceful like a gazelle
[5:48:38] <NewWillinium> You know where you fought the Shadow Man? Right prior to that is another ledge drop
[5:48:40] <%Valdorick> the Chariot just takes you to the boss room
[5:48:40] <%maskofmichael> Zangief ate the armor
[5:48:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> but it leads to there eventually
[5:48:42] <%D00msDayDan> pat you walked past a scrimblo in the corner there
[5:48:43] <%boggsz12> on the bloodhound knight in the room you drop down to
[5:48:44] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat can you not tell that chat is now having more fun not telling you clearly?  That's the new game, now.
[5:49:01] <rudiciuscaesar> PSYCHO CRUSHA
[5:49:06] <%luftraumm1> that jumpy skelly tho LUL
[5:49:06] <NBUsagi> Did that skeleton just spiral dive out?
[5:49:07] <NewWillinium> Second drop
[5:49:09] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Did that skeletonjust Psycho Crusher lol
[5:49:14] <TwistParabola> either is fine
[5:49:23] <Ricee> he definitely just does psycho crusher @NBUsagi LUL
[5:49:23] <%boggsz12> to skip to the boss
[5:49:27] <Berendenn> the first one is fine
[5:49:29] <%Valdorick> I didn't even know you COULD do the first drop... but the first drop took you to the second drop's top room anyway.
[5:49:35] <Wakerz140> The first one takes you to the boss iirc
[5:49:36] <rudiciuscaesar> @NBUsagi yeah, the skeletons do Psycho Crushers, like how the Mimics do hurricane kicks lol
[5:49:40] <Berendenn> literally all you had to do was get into the window you were right
[5:49:42] <Wakerz140> the second leads to more loot
[5:49:47] <NewWillinium> Basically to skip to the boss.
[5:49:52] <Ricee> skip the first hidey hole and go to the archer skeleton
[5:49:54] <%Kouseo> you can run past the two and make it to the archer
[5:49:54] <%baka_sugoi> csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn csbeastSetIn
[5:49:57] <%cade_calrayn> Honestly, it's not worth it, Pat, come back later
[5:49:57] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Pat what are you doing lol
[5:49:59] <NewWillinium> Man I hate these Chariot dungeons though. They are THE most frustrating thing
[5:50:03] <$vehementvadr> perhaps break required
[5:50:11] <rudiciuscaesar> deep breaths, no frustration
[5:50:11] <NBUsagi> @rudiciuscaesar Wild
[5:50:16] <N0bdyNoOne> I did this dungeon as a drinking game. Had a shot everytime the chariot killed me. I passed out before I finished it
[5:50:23] <%Valdorick> A dagger with quickstep or bloodhound step makes this much faster... though may mess with your timings, I guess
[5:50:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> are there any ledges under the bridge?
[5:50:24] <oda_flobunaga> So un-frustrate and do something else.
[5:50:47] <+mecha_11> wtf
[5:50:55] <%boggsz12> go dodwn and kill that guy
[5:50:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> oh my mistake, the two spots are connected tho
[5:50:57] <%justcallmebobplease> ITEM
[5:50:58] <Baeltyr> pat
[5:50:59] <%Valdorick> Good job, now kill that dude
[5:50:59] <%abakkus> item in the pots
[5:51:00] <%justcallmebobplease> ITEM IN POTS
[5:51:00] <+mecha_11> ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
[5:51:06] <Baeltyr> pat theres an item in those pots
[5:51:14] <Zourath> This also works.
[5:51:20] <niffinbox> NotLikeThis
[5:51:22] <+Grayhammatter> ayyyy
[5:51:22] <%justcallmebobplease> ITEM IN POTS ATOP STAIRS
[5:51:24] <%Valdorick> Grats! items!
[5:51:25] <rudiciuscaesar> wasn't that also a boss originally?
[5:51:25] <Ricee> another armor set where he was looking
[5:51:26] <Paperware> It's fine, he needs to go back up there anyways
[5:51:31] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> YOU DID IT
[5:51:40] <%maskofmichael> number go down
[5:51:41] <%Nobrev> is the item anything useful, chat
[5:51:48] <N0bdyNoOne> Does it play terrible music when you wear it?
[5:52:00] <rudiciuscaesar> it's a jousting knight suit of armor
[5:52:06] <%Valdorick> That's the Knight Set for this region, since this region has no Knight enemies
[5:52:06] <+Joller2> hey pat i think you should know theres an item in the pots up the ladder
[5:52:09] <rudiciuscaesar> even has the cool chest-shield
[5:52:16] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> No Helmet?
[5:52:19] <%Valdorick> Oh that look rad
[5:52:25] <Gray_LoFi> That's a good cape
[5:52:35] <rudiciuscaesar> no, Pat is skeleton man, no need for helmet
[5:52:40] <%justcallmebobplease> So you just don't want the item atop the ladder, in the pots then?
[5:52:44] <%Valdorick> You can leave now
[5:52:44] <NewWillinium> I think I need to walk away from the boss fight I'm at for a while. And yeah you're done with that dungeon.
[5:52:58] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @rudiciuscaesar awwww I am sad
[5:52:59] <$Stari> Pat there was an item in those pots you walked past
[5:52:59] <NBUsagi> lol
[5:53:06] <%baka_sugoi> Cool
[5:53:15] <Baeltyr> god damn it pat
[5:53:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[5:53:18] <42nfl19> what if the item was...a Hat?
[5:53:20] <senfood> Radical.
[5:53:21] <rudiciuscaesar> lol there's too much stuffed into this game
[5:53:22] <Berendenn> did you get the big stupid finger mace in there
[5:53:22] <%Solarint> D:
[5:53:22] <oda_flobunaga> Look Chat, He doesn't want Orbo's McGlorgo

[5:53:24] <NBUsagi> yes sir 0w 0
[5:53:26] <Gelphaze> YEAH!
[5:53:26] <%Valdorick> The item in the pots is probably just like... a white strip of flesh, or some garbage.
[5:53:27] <+Grayhammatter> rad
[5:53:27] <+Joller2> respectable
[5:53:28] <rudiciuscaesar> it's like stuffed crust pizza BUT TOO MUCH
[5:53:29] <%greasypete00> its probqbly a smithing stone [8]
[5:53:29] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt it would be good for your build
[5:53:30] <%justcallmebobplease> But Pat what about the scrimblo?

[5:55:15] <%Solarint> vip him
[5:55:16] <senfood> It was resin not grease but damn I was close.
[5:55:17] <Baeltyr> mod that man

[5:55:31] <jacksawjack> So  he's Aldritch
[5:55:33] <Berendenn> noice
[5:55:37] <%abakkus> awoo
[5:55:40] <%cade_calrayn> Crucible set is better IMO
[5:55:41] <+SaintSalted> the cale set is m fav
[5:55:41] <senfood> AWOOOOOOOO
[5:55:43] <+SaintSalted> scale
[5:55:45] <%boggsz12> i like tree crucible a lot cause of the black cloth around the legs
[5:55:48] <Kain5707> its just generic soilder armor
[5:55:50] <%OrangeMDT> That boy needs to be a tiktok
[5:55:52] <Paperware> It's kinda like the a read aNd black version of the elite knight set
[5:55:55] <NewWillinium> According to Mybabynames Rykard is an actual name. Spanish Version of Richard?
[5:55:55] <Wakerz140> @PatStaresAt I was mistaken in saying this dungeon has my favorite armor, I was thinking of one in the Altus Plateau you haven't found yet
[5:55:55] <%OrangeMDT> Bit
[5:55:56] <%luftraumm1> Rykard probably early saxon or germanic for of richard
[5:55:59] <+SaintSalted> crucible knees and helmet look doofy
[5:56:01] <%Valdorick> Crucible Set is nice, but it doesn't match with anything that isn't itself.
[5:56:04] <niffinbox> you should invade that one guys game get revenge
[5:56:04] <%boggsz12> generic soldier armor is cool tho
[5:56:07] <%luftraumm1> crucible armor yes, set no
[5:56:11] <Kain5707> meh theres better
[5:56:16] <+charp35> I like Blaidd's armor the most
[5:56:16] <$vehementvadr> sholdier armour
[5:56:27] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt If you beat the boss of shaded fortress the finger lady has his armor it is dope af
[5:56:29] <%rumtumtugnutz> your armor has boob cpnes
[5:56:32] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat are you saying Atlas on purpose, or have you not noticed it's AL-TUS?
[5:56:32] <%SuckerPunchSyd> One brass titty
[5:56:37] <Wakerz140> They're right to the east of the map where you fought the Draconic tree sentinel
[5:56:40] <Wakerz140> there's two dungeons there
[5:56:41] <%boggsz12> did you fight a guy called ordovis?
[5:56:41] <Sunstalker> Below where you fought draconic sentinel; two dungeons there
[5:56:42] <TwistParabola> did he find the tree sentinel armor?
[5:56:52] <rudiciuscaesar> I expected a fucking dragon to come down
[5:56:53] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Did pat found Yuta btw ?

[5:57:08] <%luftraumm1> were siege towers this big? i bet not
[5:57:13] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> There are two dungeons down there btw
[5:57:18] <%Valdorick> Oh yeyeye, we're sending him back to back into AWFUL dungeons

[5:57:57] <%Dakuu75> remember when Pumpkin head was a boss? (good times)
[5:57:57] <%luftraumm1> oh he abandoned parrying?
[5:58:11] <ammobasket> @rumtumtugnutz fr that's a jousting thing I think? to deflect spears?
[5:58:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> i had some trouble with this next bit but you're almost 80 levels higher than me so I'm curious
[5:58:20] <NewWillinium> @HeroToxiko Lhutel is pretty good against everything but Fast and multiple enemies. Otherwise you have better options I think
[5:58:31] <+Grayhammatter> wow, barricade is busted
[5:58:41] <HeroToxiko> @HeroToxiko thanks
[5:58:42] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Check the roundtable finger maiden and check out nials armor
[5:58:44] <42nfl19> So is the block into attack a new thing to the game or a special skill/ash?
[5:58:48] <+Glidemusic> snake eater
[5:58:49] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt If you plan on fighting the Gelmir boss, don't forget to get Serpent-Hunter out of your chest. It's required for that fight.
[5:59:00] <%luftraumm1> cool
[5:59:07] <%justcallmebobplease> Doesn't Pat already have Nial's armor?
[5:59:08] <James_Quivers> Shields in this game are so much better, I'm grateful for that
[5:59:11] <%greasypete00> O'Neill's armour?
[5:59:12] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @Bluwizard21 He hasn't been there yet.
[5:59:16] <TwistParabola> volcano manor boss
[5:59:18] <rudiciuscaesar> holy shit tha tbird
[5:59:25] <rudiciuscaesar> that scared me and I'm not even playing
[5:59:35] <%RealThiele> just did the catacombs next to radahn and boy that boss was annoying
[5:59:38] <NewWillinium> There are also . . . at least two more Dungeons and a Boss at Gelmir as you climb up it I think.
[5:59:41] <%boggsz12> you plan on fighting that boss tonight?
[5:59:43] <$SGrim> Atmosphere!
[5:59:46] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Yeah, that's what I meant. You had been putting most of your weapons away, and I was worried that you had put it up.
[5:59:48] <James_Quivers> Straight up execution
[5:59:50] <%luftraumm1> cool
[5:59:50] <zhenthrim213> Firing squad'
[5:59:51] <%boggsz12> or are you going to finish the manor's quest first?
[5:59:53] <%Dakuu75> how do you progress the volcano manor stuff? just do all the NPC ionvasions?
[5:59:59] <rudiciuscaesar> these little mini shit Shokan lol
[6:00:01] <NewWillinium> @RealThiele It is. But I appreciated the show on the way to the fight
[6:00:06] <Ricee> @Dakuu75 yes
[6:00:08] <%jamsbybetty> @Dakuu75 yep
[6:00:15] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Is the block into attack a new thing that all shields have? Or a special skill/ash? Seems safer than parrying
[6:00:19] <%RealThiele> @RealThiele like me some free souls for afking thats for sure
[6:00:22] <%justcallmebobplease> MERCHENT TO YOUR LEFT
[6:00:24] <%Dakuu75> cool

[6:00:31] <James_Quivers> What a thrill
[6:00:31] <DerpioParty> weeeeee
[6:00:31] <+Kavtech> What shardbearers has pat defeated so far?
[6:00:32] <Sunstalker> LuL
[6:00:32] <%Solarint> LUL
[6:00:35] <%boggsz12> there's also a cave in a corner of radahn's boss arena if you're interested later
[6:00:38] <TwistParabola> IM SEARCHING AND IM MELTING FOR YOU
[6:00:44] <TwistParabola> What a... thrill......
[6:00:45] <%luftraumm1> but atabbers
[6:00:46] <%justcallmebobplease> There's a Merchant up the ladders on one side, you can jump to him if you pick the wrong ladder set - he's super easy to miss.
[6:00:46] <%RealThiele> marionette archers do not fuck around
[6:00:59] <%ShogunNoonto> How the fuck did you get to Volcano manor Without taking this path
[6:01:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> one ladder leads to a merchant I believe
[6:01:09] <%Bluwizard21> pat did beat shaded fortress right?
[6:01:11] <blue8moon> there's a ladder left to the one you were going up
[6:01:12] <Sunstalker> You can go back down from the top to find him too. He's on left side of the climb
[6:01:18] <%RealThiele> Rya has a quest that gets you a free teleport to the manor
[6:01:21] <+Kavtech> @ShogunNoonto NPC questline teleports you there.
[6:01:28] <+extantCadence> There's at least 2 ways to get there
[6:01:30] <TwistParabola> I gave my honor..... not for honor, but, for you~!
[6:01:36] <TwistParabola> *my life
[6:01:44] <%jamsbybetty> there are I think at least 3 ways to get to volcano manor proper lol
[6:01:45] <TwistParabola> Snake Eater~
[6:01:45] <Ricee> you can get abducted
[6:01:45] <%luftraumm1> patches
[6:01:46] <%RealThiele> visions of snake
[6:01:47] <Ricee> :)
[6:01:54] <%TG_Cid11> have fun with this area pat
[6:02:06] <%justcallmebobplease> Pat heads up if you kill merchants they drop a Bell Bearing for their gear, you can make the Roundtable merchant the omni-merchant.
[6:02:18] <it_came_from_outer_space> might as well go up first
[6:02:19] <adamdavid101> keep going up
[6:02:19] <%justcallmebobplease> Okay, just making sure you knew.
[6:02:20] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> the end up on the same place
[6:02:22] <it_came_from_outer_space> can always go down
[6:02:29] <James_Quivers> KILL SANTA
[6:02:29] <%sniffy77> merchants are like, one of the few normal people in this fucking place
[6:02:32] <%boggsz12> they have cool instruments and play them sometimes i like them
[6:02:32] <%RealThiele> but killing merchants just cause they are hungry :(
[6:02:34] <blue8moon> the merchants are nice, no reason to kill them
[6:02:38] <%abakkus> snake eeaaterrrr
[6:02:38] <%JoshManVGH> I FOUND THE KAMEHAMEHA!
[6:02:38] <TwistParabola> SOMEDAY, YOU'LL FEED, ON A TREE FROG
[6:02:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> its really tall
[6:02:49] <%sniffy77> snake ladder
[6:02:50] <DerpioParty> What a thrill
[6:02:57] <%justcallmebobplease> I like how some of the Merchants do some wild shit when you fight them - like do mounted combat, or reveal they are Frenzied as fuck.
[6:03:10] <%radiorosewater> you missed the item at the bottom of this ladder, it would be good for your build
[6:03:10] <TwistParabola> those messages 100% say 'well done, snake!'
[6:03:15] <NewWillinium> Alright there will be a dungeon if you follow the path to the right aaaaaall the way up.
[6:03:19] <James_Quivers> Frenzy boys
[6:03:26] <%luftraumm1> insane
[6:03:27] <+SiegfangArchitectofSin> Interesting they inflict madness
[6:03:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah there's some big fights goin on
[6:03:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> shits violent
[6:03:45] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt To elaborate if you beat the boss of shaded fortress his armor is one of the heaviest best and imo coolest in the game
[6:03:55] <%RealThiele> grace across bridge
[6:04:14] <%abakkus> hole, o hole
[6:04:18] <NewWillinium> So I'm about 80ish of the way through the game now I think. Do we ever actually meet the Three Fingers? Like the Two fingers at the Roundtable?
[6:04:25] <%abakkus> LUL
[6:04:29] <James_Quivers> Think those lore stones are some of GRRMs writing on the settings? Seems that way since they're more straightforward than the lore normally is @PatStaresAt
[6:04:31] <WorstThingsFirst> lmao grace holes
[6:04:31] <TwistParabola> LUL
[6:04:32] <ape_hawk> youre a grace hole
[6:04:35] <DerpioParty> Well it's grace and this is a hole
[6:04:35] <GravyLangley> The Grussy
[6:04:38] <%Valdorick> Graceholes sounds lewd
[6:04:40] <%boggsz12> how did he even come up with that
[6:04:40] <%maskofmichael> but not a misleading name
[6:04:42] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @NewWillinium If you explore a secret part of an optional area, yeah.
[6:04:42] <@Spydurman> gracussy
[6:04:44] <%luftraumm1> grace hole, 2hats wrong with it?
[6:04:45] <%jamsbybetty> they're G-Spots
[6:04:45] <ape_hawk> pat, youre just mad you didnt think of it first
[6:04:46] <%Solarint> its a great name
[6:04:50] <+alphonseisbest> @newwillinium later in side path
[6:04:51] <%radiorosewater> woolieSPICE woolieFABRICATION
[6:04:53] <WorstThingsFirst> Gracehole is Grace's hole.

[6:04:58] <TwistParabola> yes~
[6:04:58] <WorstThingsFirst> Ew.
[6:05:00] <%ShogunNoonto> There's a cave here ?
[6:05:02] <James_Quivers> These dudes are all over the game, they're fuckin UBIQUOTUS

[6:05:07] <+Grayhammatter> go get the G-spots

[6:05:15] <x2Twistedx> nah you ll be right , tis a quick  one
[6:05:20] <+Double_Tap_That> Woolie and holes, name a better duo
[6:05:22] <jacksawjack> Plague said they looked like prolapsed anuses with golden humanities floating out of them.
[6:05:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> woof
[6:05:37] <%Solarint> close one damn
[6:05:42] <+Grayhammatter> oh hey, there's the boss
[6:05:48] <%Bluwizard21> @James_Quivers It's like they fell out of the sky or something in a big problematic apocalypse and were scattered about
[6:05:57] <Ricee> is pat basically finished? where is he in story progression?
[6:05:58] <oda_flobunaga> Well, we know what Plague likes
[6:06:02] <TwistParabola> oh look it's Marg...ot

[6:06:28] <%maskofmichael> STRAIGHT UP THE TAINT!
[6:06:28] <%Piemen99> huh wow it seems like they didnt need a stat up to kick your ass
[6:06:29] <+hi_imjams> anyone else rockin a strength build but thinking of respecing
[6:06:29] <TwistParabola> THE CANNON

[6:06:35] <NBUsagi> What?
[6:06:37] <42nfl19> WE BLOOD BORNE
[6:06:38] <TwistParabola> read the rest!
[6:06:39] <+Grayhammatter> big jar
[6:06:40] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Apparently in the Warred Catacombs after Radan theres a farming spot where you can just let the computer npcs kill each other and you get the souls? Max got 200K Runes for it. Shit seems nuts
[6:06:43] <digaogrunge> GUN GUN GUN
[6:06:45] <James_Quivers> The Demi-Human Queens seem like second easiest bosses in the game to me, after the Tibia Mariners
[6:06:46] <Ner234> GUN?
[6:06:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> gun uses ammo?
[6:06:50] <NBUsagi> blam blams
[6:06:53] <%Nobrev> the lore is funny
[6:06:54] <42nfl19> read the rest?
[6:07:08] <%luftraumm1> lore funny
[6:07:12] <%RealThiele> gun iirc has no scaling just upgrades so meh
[6:07:13] <thewrathofscience> This is literally just the bloodborne arm cannon
[6:07:20] <oda_flobunaga> naw thur ain't @PatStaresAt
[6:07:26] <%geekjacob> wait gun uses ammo lame
[6:07:29] <%cade_calrayn> just the Coil Shield, Pat
[6:07:29] <+ReallyBigRocks> just hit people with it tbh
[6:07:29] <NBUsagi> This place is full of undead and sucks 0w 0
[6:07:39] <NBUsagi> like it looks amazing but like it looks like it sucks
[6:07:47] <Eye_of_the_red_giant> do you have the two gun shields?
[6:07:50] <%RealThiele> big progress
[6:07:58] <ape_hawk> are any of these undead chosen?
[6:08:03] <NBUsagi> Oh damn even the minor tree here is dead
[6:08:04] <+ReallyBigRocks> Those Who Live In Death, pleas
[6:08:07] <WorstThingsFirst> OOOH
[6:08:13] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Fallingstar!?
[6:08:13] <WorstThingsFirst> Full-grown
[6:08:14] <+Grayhammatter> wow
[6:08:15] <+PR0swagonist> this guy sucks
[6:08:16] <%abakkus> sweet christ
[6:08:20] <%boggsz12> this boss can fuck itself
[6:08:20] <Ghufufin> its full grown!
[6:08:21] <%cade_calrayn> that thing's a literal alien
[6:08:22] <ExpressNode> This one is full grown
[6:08:22] <rudiciuscaesar> I looked away for like 4 seconds ot check a text...
[6:08:25] <%LaughingCatt> i hate these things
[6:08:25] <NewWillinium> You can also go around the mountain for that one Fort.
[6:08:29] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> GG
[6:08:30] <NewWillinium> There's a LOT!
[6:08:30] <%boggsz12> YES
[6:08:31] <Ricee> yes
[6:08:31] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeah
[6:08:32] <%RealThiele> this guy took me awhile
[6:08:34] <%cade_calrayn> it's a meteoric alien
[6:08:35] <James_Quivers> Probably nothing
[6:08:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> yup
[6:08:37] <%LaughingCatt> hmmm where have we heard that one before
[6:08:38] <%Valdorick> Not one bit!
[6:08:39] <ape_hawk> im not shocked, honestly
[6:08:39] <blue8moon> yep
[6:08:42] <+Ravenian96> nah, they're aliens aren't real
[6:08:42] <%greasypete00> radahn was holding them back
[6:08:43] <%luftraumm1> yep
[6:08:43] <Ghufufin> possibly ancient aliens?
[6:08:47] <%luftraumm1> lots
[6:08:47] <DerpioParty> It's just an ant
[6:08:47] <$SGrim> It's not shocking for a post-bloodborne FromSoft game
[6:08:48] <NewWillinium> You kind of just have to roll with it
[6:08:48] <%radiorosewater> dont worry about it
[6:08:48] <%cade_calrayn> and the whole "Outer God" concept that keeps coming up
[6:08:48] <it_came_from_outer_space> Its pretty clear from like 1/3 through that aliens are kind of just /around/
[6:08:50] <%Dakuu75> fucking hate these things
[6:08:52] <jubejube56> Oh right also before I forget you had the new deathroot
[6:08:53] <+PR0swagonist> the number is certainly more than expected
[6:08:56] <Questiy> I mean aren't both of the major players in the game space based?
[6:08:57] <+twdlrr> Almost a Bloodborne 2 worth of aliens
[6:08:58] <XxMoliciousxX> yes, but I don't feel it's shocking
[6:09:02] <digaogrunge> The elden ring is an UFO actually
[6:09:06] <NewWillinium> Like I think the Onyx Lords are also Aliens? Maybe?
[6:09:09] <James_Quivers> Why are all the aliens Dobsonflies, too?
[6:09:09] <%abakkus> the constant allusions to meteors and things falling out of the sky does seem to be waving little alien hands at us yes
[6:09:15] <%Buttlo> This is one of the few bosses I didn't enjoy fighting.
[6:09:16] <WorstThingsFirst> Thing looks like it belongs in MH.
[6:09:16] <ammobasket> big-ol antlion
[6:09:17] <%cade_calrayn> You *can* just run right past it, FYI, Pat
[6:09:22] <%maskofmichael> This week on The History Channel
[6:09:31] <NBUsagi> Well damn
[6:09:33] <%greasypete00> I wouldn't be surprised if the surface ones only came around because radahn was stopping the stars from hitting the earth
[6:09:34] <%baka_sugoi> WOOOW
[6:09:35] <Ricee> imagine that kills you if you're wearing heavy armor
[6:09:36] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt The one you fought earlier didn't have that eye, and Astel had a full human skull under the fur.
[6:09:37] <%RealThiele> P2
[6:09:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[6:09:39] <Ghufufin> reverse gravity!
[6:09:51] <%SuckerPunchSyd> yoooooooo
[6:09:58] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Well you said it yourself at some point this whole debacle started when a meteor dropped from the sky and fucked everything
[6:10:08] <+Grayhammatter> go mimic go!
[6:10:11] <%cade_calrayn> @Fenrisulfr_V oh fuck I didn't even realize, this is a baby Astel?!?
[6:10:15] <+Jeshk0> have there been any weapons you get from chopping off bits of a boss?
[6:10:18] <+LandOfTheWay> @NewWillinium i'm pretty sure either the onyx lords are aliens or native humanoids mutated by the meteor mentioned in relevant item descriptions
[6:10:23] <WorstThingsFirst> DAMN
[6:10:29] <Sunstalker> That's just it's phase 2. There's on left inside the shrimp mine, if you ever skipped that. Pretty worthless drop for it though
[6:10:39] <%justcallmebobplease> Cripes how many of those Fallingstar Beast bosses are there?
[6:10:40] <NewWillinium> @LandOfTheWay That's the impression I was getting too.
[6:10:50] <+wizard_of_diamonds> GGEEEEE
[6:10:54] <%furiousfurioso> yea that Radan holding back the stars thing really gets put into perspective when shit like this was on the falling stars
[6:10:54] <%Dakuu75> (I should use rot breath more)
[6:11:32] <%LaughingCatt> they had god magic lobosShrug
[6:11:35] <NewWillinium> Oh you can just ride there from the front of the Manor
[6:11:36] <%VHGS> asbestos
[6:11:36] <Ricee> jump across the gap on top of the mountain
[6:11:38] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> below the manor
[6:11:38] <NBUsagi> I like how this fantasy world is techincally fully under alien invasion XD
[6:11:39] <+LandOfTheWay> carefully
[6:11:41] <Sunstalker> from frontside of the manor
[6:11:42] <%boggsz12> jump off a rock in the boss arena
[6:11:42] <%cade_calrayn> Look around on the top of the mountain
[6:11:44] <+ReallyBigRocks> I believe there's a path from the manor that leads there
[6:11:53] <%VHGS> there's a path down from the boss arena
[6:11:54] <Sunstalker> go up top here and then jump the ledge
[6:11:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @cade_calrayn I imagine Astel(and the other you find like it) are the final stage of whatever this life cycle is.
[6:11:57] <%RealThiele> theres a path from the mountain top
[6:12:00] <jacksawjack> just follow the path from the manor down
[6:12:01] <%RealThiele> go back up
[6:12:02] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Theres an entrance on the side
[6:12:02] <blue8moon> you can get to the tree from the manor
[6:12:03] <x2Twistedx> yeah you got
[6:12:06] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The minor erdtree can be reached following the path away from the manor
[6:12:07] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its where you grab the map for this area
[6:12:08] <Ghufufin> @furiousfurioso  fr fr i thought the holding back stars thing was radan being an insane asshole, but no he was trying to protect ppl
[6:12:21] <%Dakuu75> god damn it video game... not MORE CONTENT~!!
[6:12:26] <NBUsagi> So are castles just super dungeons?
[6:12:29] <James_Quivers> That castle is a fun time :^)
[6:12:35] <sweatch0> legit cant figure out how to get to that castle
[6:12:37] <%RealThiele> gotta hand it to him
[6:12:40] <NewWillinium> Kind of? Forts can be really really short
[6:12:41] <%cade_calrayn> "I made it!" *immediately gets knocked off his horse*
[6:12:46] <rudiciuscaesar> lol im sorry, wtf was that
[6:12:48] <+Grayhammatter> oh christ, hands
[6:12:49] <%SForlord> THE SCRIMBLO
[6:12:52] <%JoshManVGH> @dakuu75 It's such an unexpected feeling with this game!
[6:12:57] <sweatch0> spend 2 hours today looking for a way in
[6:13:00] <NewWillinium> FUCK those hand things
[6:13:07] <%SForlord> Hand banana
[6:13:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> fingercreepers :)
[6:13:16] <42nfl19> Wait is this how the finder weapon was made?
[6:13:16] <NBUsagi> Thes things are gross
[6:13:19] <rudiciuscaesar> no sir, I don't like it
[6:13:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Look at the manicure on THAT

[6:13:32] <Ricee> we'll devour the gods togetherrrrr
[6:13:33] <James_Quivers> "Lord Rykard why did you become the God Emperor of Dune?"
[6:13:35] <+FlappySeal_> did that guy just flip you off with a laser blast
[6:13:37] <%cade_calrayn> You actually do seem to find out where those hands come from
[6:13:45] <%SForlord> To be fair, you have one of their fingers
[6:13:49] <%cade_calrayn> Or rather, they show up in an area that makes sense as to what they are
[6:13:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> weird, that dude was disguised as a zombie for me
[6:13:55] <%justcallmebobplease> Yeah keep going
[6:13:56] <Gelphaze> Oh fuck pat don't mess with that!
[6:14:06] <WorstThingsFirst> LMAO

[6:14:17] <%abakkus> capital-f Fuck that
[6:14:17] <$SGrim> Damn
[6:14:17] <Baeltyr> neat
[6:14:17] <+Faultlined> Oh god
[6:14:17] <blue8moon> death is deadly
[6:14:18] <+SiegfangArchitectofSin> Damn
[6:14:21] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> You spit on me I'll spit on lol
[6:14:22] <James_Quivers> yeaaaaaaaa those guys are gnarly

[6:14:25] <rudiciuscaesar> also that thing had like 5000+ HP wtf
[6:14:26] <%SForlord> Epic
[6:14:27] <rudiciuscaesar> is that a boss?
[6:14:28] <haisho> WOOF
[6:14:31] <+FlappySeal_> death is bad, more at ten
[6:14:34] <$HyperionXV> raysS
[6:14:36] <Midnight188> ! CURSED !
[6:14:36] <%rumtumtugnutz> Death Blote
[6:14:38] <%luftraumm1> who's got the most rotted mouth
[6:14:44] <haisho> "Nice status effect. Let me show you mine."
[6:14:49] <+thehatch20> Tea bagged lol
[6:14:55] <DerpioParty> Is that that one alien boss from Metal Slug?
[6:15:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> this thing is a bloodborne for sure
[6:15:13] <+Grayhammatter> thanks i hate it
[6:15:13] <Samuraiflame> his stinky breath was stinkier than yours
[6:15:19] <%Dakuu75> it sure does feel bad when you miss the riposte
[6:15:24] <+PR0swagonist> is thaT A SUNFLOWER?
[6:15:40] <Ricee> oh this is a great tree
[6:15:50] <Ricee> a great physick from this
[6:16:01] <%Fenrisulfr_V> The Wormfaces are so pitiful to me. They're rarely outright hostile to you unless you fuck with them, and they sit there crying when they're by themselves.
[6:16:12] <jacksawjack> A minor Turd Tree in this instance
[6:16:17] <%Valdorick> 10 seconds no FP
[6:16:29] <James_Quivers> This one has the crystaltear that they might nerf lol
[6:16:34] <Gray_LoFi> Man remember when that grab just insta-killed you? Good times
[6:16:35] <%radiorosewater> ITS THE REMATCH
[6:16:38] <%boggsz12> i don't understand poise in this game. rats from limgrave can still stagger me, even in full bull goat armor
[6:16:38] <%cade_calrayn> god I just wanna see Pat fight Malenia
[6:16:39] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @Fenrisulfr_V Sad alien babies
[6:16:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Gg
[6:17:02] <%Agami23> and now you have the best tear
[6:17:08] <%Valdorick> @boggsz12 If I had to guess, some enemies just flat out cheat, and ignore poise, like the Torch Hollows in DS1
[6:17:09] <%Dakuu75> why is Paige tweeting "feet"
[6:17:10] <%justcallmebobplease> @cade_calrayn I want his reaction to Phase 2 so bad.
[6:17:14] <rudiciuscaesar> what are those, like WEAPONS in FFVII, they defend nature or something? The tree in this instance?
[6:17:19] <jacksawjack> @TurtlesAndTentacles With One Reborn Faces
[6:17:19] <%Kirby_Sauce> ey @PatStaresAt did you ever do that dungeon in the cave where you first wake up?
[6:17:34] <%sniffy77> its wymyns day she can do what she wantsw
[6:17:51] <%boggsz12> @boggsz12 yeah, that seems to be the case for all dog and rat enemies in the game. just a weird decision, i guess to keep those enemy types from becoming obsolete later
[6:17:53] <%pabloelenano2> hi path today i discover a teacher of mine in the university is playing elden ring we where talking about it before class and was crazy
[6:17:59] <%JoshManVGH> Did you go to the other minor erdtree near the capital? The one by the back entrance?
[6:18:02] <%boggsz12> no idea
[6:18:13] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> From the abductor virgin grace
[6:18:17] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> down the ravine
[6:18:27] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt The iron virgin bosses fight will lead you to the seethewaters
[6:18:31] <%JoshManVGH> BACK enterence
[6:18:48] <+lord_sykos> Have to take a path in the ravine from Altus Plateau
[6:18:50] <%boggsz12> let the iron virgin at the bottom of raya lucaria eat you
[6:18:50] <NewWillinium> Seethewaters is a Dungeon in Gelmir and a way to the Fort.
[6:18:52] <%cade_calrayn> Blue lake south of Gelmir, Pat
[6:18:58] <NewWillinium> Or connected to the way tot he fort
[6:18:59] <Midnight188> you're just saying words now
[6:19:04] <sweatch0> word man we made them up
[6:19:04] <oda_flobunaga> He did
[6:19:09] <%Bluwizard21> thats it
[6:19:10] <+ReallyBigRocks> seethewater river grace
[6:19:11] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> that one
[6:19:19] <%cade_calrayn> Yes
[6:19:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> no, other way
[6:19:20] <James_Quivers> Yes
[6:19:20] <Sunstalker> yes, multiple graces
[6:19:21] <+RushUnplugged> yuup
[6:19:24] <%Valdorick> Yes
[6:19:25] <Wakerz140> Correct
[6:19:25] <%Bluwizard21> Go to that boss arena and drop down and go for a fun run
[6:19:26] <+lord_sykos> Yes
[6:19:27] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> yes
[6:19:28] <oda_flobunaga> yep
[6:19:30] <James_Quivers> I went that way myself
[6:19:31] <%Valdorick> You did it, you did it the AWFUL WAY
[6:19:32] <%cade_calrayn> You can circle the volcano, but you can also reach it just by going west
[6:19:35] <sweatch0> HOW
[6:19:35] <+RedMaskBandit> yeup
[6:19:36] <Sunstalker> You go left when you jump out the abductor cave
[6:19:37] <Wakerz140> I think
[6:19:39] <%Valdorick> hence why chat was mad you go up there so easy.
[6:20:01] <+RedMaskBandit> it's a massive area that leads to the manor.
[6:20:03] <Sunstalker> You need to go that way to reach Azut because he overlooks a one way jump down to gelmir's hero grave
[6:20:10] <NewWillinium> Actually yeah. You know where you fought those Marienettes on the Bridge? Hop down the bridge ledge there
[6:20:13] <%Dakuu75> oh yeah. you wanna find a big magma lake. that's where you're trying to get passed
[6:20:20] <jacksawjack> Shall we extend the Wooly TTC to 32 - 48 months?
[6:20:22] <sweatch0> see the water
[6:20:24] <Sunstalker> Good new is, you COULD just run past it all to find azur at the very ass end
[6:20:41] <+ReallyBigRocks> North is the way I went
[6:20:42] <Sunstalker> yeah through the valley
[6:20:51] <sweatch0> be one with the green
[6:20:53] <NewWillinium> Or nevermind. You can follow the Ravine to the Fort and Dungeon
[6:21:08] <+ReallyBigRocks> and this zone is really cool too
[6:21:29] <Zourath> Fun fact, if you hadn't already talked to Patches inside the Manor, he would kick you down here.
[6:21:49] <NewWillinium> He would? Where would the kick off point be?
[6:22:01] <Sunstalker> from up near the heros grave, along the cliff
[6:22:01] <Wakerz140> Up above
[6:22:04] <moneymoves2030> Could you climb Mt Saint Helens with just your feet?
[6:22:06] <James_Quivers> SEETHE
[6:22:08] <Zourath> From the top route.
[6:22:18] <James_Quivers> This cave is fucking great
[6:22:18] <Zourath> He did the usual 2 gems near a cliff thing.
[6:22:25] <+zaddyforever> FUCK THIS PLACE
[6:22:33] <bassoontyphoon> Can’t wait for Copewater Cove
[6:22:34] <%cade_calrayn> OH RIGHT! He leaves rainbow stones and a note saying "Follow this way to treasure" at the broken bridge, Pat
[6:22:39] <Sunstalker> You'd see the sparkly stones on the piece between the ladders abnd the battlefield
[6:22:43] <Willowight> oh the poison cave
[6:22:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> there is an obscene amount of shit
[6:22:47] <17sevens> on the bright side you're nearly halfway through
[6:22:48] <%Dakuu75> can't wait for it to be 3 podcasts
[6:22:51] <James_Quivers> Bro I think a 100% run of the game will take me a month
[6:22:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> he doesn't
[6:22:56] <%boggsz12> YOU still dont get it
[6:23:00] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt He'll get it when he hits the plains
[6:23:07] <@Spydurman> your 100 hours in and how close to the end? LUL
[6:23:12] <blue8moon> every time I do something in this game I think "this game is so big"
[6:23:14] <Ricee> technically EVERYONE still doesn't get it cuz there's still questlines unsolved
[6:23:21] <%luftraumm1> badger badger
[6:23:25] <%boggsz12> like. it just keeps fucking going
[6:23:26] <%greasypete00> have you seen the full map picture
[6:23:27] <Therusher> I'm getting near 100% at ~140h
[6:23:38] <James_Quivers> MICHEAL, IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY
[6:23:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> none of us have even found the second continent yet
[6:23:47] <%JonathLP> Almost 50%
[6:23:48] <17sevens> @Ricee yeah it's been this long and we're still guessing at a seventh ending with quetlines unsolved
[6:24:01] <%cade_calrayn> 2 snow zones
[6:24:03] <Wakerz140> You have like 7ish zones left I think
[6:24:04] <%Dakuu75> lol
[6:24:04] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, this game has girth
[6:24:05] <%pabloelenano2> there is snow zones?
[6:24:07] <Wakerz140> not counting Gelmir
[6:24:08] <+cronx90> you just killed that little rat's Mom and brother then ran off
[6:24:08] <@Spydurman> it'll be shocking when the DLC comes out and it's a whole ass map
[6:24:09] <%pabloelenano2> fuck me
[6:24:10] <%cade_calrayn> Consecrated Snowfield and Mountain of Giants
[6:24:13] <blue8moon> don't forget you've barely been inside the capital LUL
[6:24:19] <%sniffy77> there the melania place too
[6:24:19] <ape_hawk> snones
[6:24:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> seriously fuck this game
[6:24:20] <Khester824> Pat what level are you?
[6:24:21] <%cade_calrayn> ^^^
[6:24:22] <haisho> and it doesn't account for what's underground too
[6:24:23] <Ricee> @17sevens I'm working on a run now that could potentially complete the game with all endings done
[6:24:23] <+PR0swagonist> but what about the moon?
[6:24:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> I love it
[6:24:27] <%Bluwizard21> no its 3
[6:24:28] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt theres also a zone thats wrecked to shit by a active Tornado.
[6:24:28] <senfood> This game is the best of all time and it can go fuck itself.
[6:24:29] <%boggsz12> and another secret optional zone
[6:24:35] <moneymoves2030> Imagine this being your first souls game I would be like "ARE THEY ALL THIS LONG?"
[6:24:36] <%cade_calrayn> the Capital is a Stormveil-type dungeon
[6:24:36] <%Pookiedaexzile> Has Paint found the Painting
[6:24:38] <NewWillinium> It's actually NOT that big?
[6:24:40] <ape_hawk> no, thats the moon
[6:24:42] <+TheMuuj> capital itself is bigger than DS1
[6:24:43] <%luftraumm1> how do you get to the top here?
[6:24:46] <+coldsama> And 2 more secret zones at least
[6:24:46] <%Solarint> wait its ONLY 2 zones? fucking shit game
[6:24:48] <ape_hawk> the moon is the final final legacy dungeon
[6:24:49] <NewWillinium> Unless there's a lot more then what I found and just missed most of it
[6:24:50] <+hakumaribo> isnt the skybox amazing though?
[6:24:51] <%justcallmebobplease> Farum Azula or summat
[6:24:52] <Wakerz140> Faram Azula
[6:24:58] <%boggsz12> do you know about the tree zone?
[6:25:00] <Ricee> oh yeah the capital and the sewers are massive
[6:25:02] <%watts121> The Capitol's sewer has a fucking sewer.
[6:25:02] <%Dustin_Gunn> pat not a fan of blind playthroughs I guess
[6:25:05] <%cade_calrayn> *PLUS* there's a sewer system below the Capital if you wanna do the Dung Eater quest, Pat

[6:40:10] <%boggsz12> :)
[6:40:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> What's the weapon Pat's got?
[6:40:28] <%FunkyStreams> FunkyStreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months! So, is Elden Ring practically supposed to be Oblivion, but it's Dark Souls?
[6:40:39] <%justcallmebobplease> @wizard_of_diamonds Black Gargoyle Sword, something like that.
[6:40:43] <%cade_calrayn> BEAR
[6:40:44] <%notsoy> dark souls, but oblivion size
[6:40:53] <Sunstalker> That thing is scripted to do it even if you come from the other side. It's funny
[6:40:54] <XxMoliciousxX> ape-bear
[6:40:57] <+Grayhammatter> far enough though
[6:41:01] <dante_must_die_exe> time for MEAT BALL
[6:41:02] <%pabloelenano2> can you manual aim it
[6:41:03] <%FunkyStreams> gunna put some rock in your eye.
[6:41:03] <%pabloelenano2> ?
[6:41:03] <moneymoves2030> STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM!
[6:41:13] <Midnight188> rajang???
[6:41:15] <+ReallyBigRocks> this bear beat my fuckin ass so hard
[6:41:30] <moneymoves2030> kenai NO!!
[6:41:31] <%notsoy> lol 105k souls jesus christ
[6:41:32] <blue8moon> these bears are insane
[6:41:34] <%cade_calrayn> those things are INSANELY OP
[6:41:38] <dante_must_die_exe> it does lmao
[6:41:39] <%tetraes> can fight demigods get wrecked by bear
[6:41:42] <%boggsz12> i still have to just brute force those bears
[6:41:43] <NewWillinium> I still have no idea how the fuck one fights those bears. That charge move comes out of *nothing*
[6:41:48] <+RushUnplugged> oblivion or skyrim if they actually had gameplay
[6:41:48] <Vermillion129> pretty sure it doesnt stay broken
[6:41:52] <%Cozy90> io live oblivion more anyway
[6:41:52] <%jamsbybetty> rune bears are fukken shit-asses
[6:41:57] <+actionhanktx> actionhanktx subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 31 months! 
[6:41:59] <Ricee> can't wait to make a stealth archer build in this game
[6:42:01] <Ricee> :)
[6:42:03] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt how is this based in Norse mythos?
[6:42:16] <%pabloelenano2> @Ricee  i actually did
[6:42:17] <dante_must_die_exe> OR tuned as intended
[6:42:19] <Ghufufin> skyrim
[6:42:21] <senfood> There's a big ass tree.
[6:42:22] <rudiciuscaesar> the world trees, the armor, VERY Viking
[6:42:27] <kinkade_77> it is norse
[6:42:32] <%cade_calrayn> Malenia's soldiers are literaly called Valkyries
[6:42:33] <%MaybeFalco> skyrim is the better comparison. "see that mountain, you can climb it".
[6:42:33] <dante_must_die_exe> because DS2 team do be like that
[6:42:38] <+TheMuuj> world tree and dragons
[6:42:38] <oda_flobunaga> Why would it be Norse, everything looks Saxon
[6:42:41] <Ricee> are there any good hybrid bows? @pabloelenano2
[6:42:41] <Vermillion129> oh cool
[6:42:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> vikings loved runes
[6:42:43] <%boggsz12> oh shit yeah yddrasil
[6:42:46] <steamodin> This game is based in Ohio and all enemies are inspired by the inhabitants of Cleveland.
[6:42:46] <it_came_from_outer_space> dog
[6:42:47] <%abakkus> horse
[6:42:49] <Willowight> its a dog
[6:42:50] <%FunkyStreams> @PatStaresAt Exactly! This is more western fantasy setting, like Oblivion.
[6:42:55] <%greasypete00> its a big amalgam of various mythoses
[6:42:55] <NewWillinium> "This is the Skyrim of Dark Souls games"
[6:42:56] <%boggsz12> it's an asshole
[6:42:57] <HeroToxiko> it's more than norse but yeah
[6:43:01] <%watts121> I keep telling people that Elden Ring's World Tree is more like Berserks then it is like Norse Mythology.
[6:43:01] <%radiorosewater> this is a setting
[6:43:02] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Ofnir is clearly based on Odin too
[6:43:02] <%barrakuta371> bear horse dog
[6:43:05] <+LandOfTheWay> a few of the demigods parallel norse deities
[6:43:06] <%RealThiele> Giant dog ahead
[6:43:08] <%pabloelenano2> @Ricee  i found the magic giant bow pretty good, it works with int and dex
[6:43:13] <rudiciuscaesar> I wish you could climb like in Breath of the Wild, I think that's a revolutionary mechanic, like Shadow of the Colossus did it and no one really picked it up for open world games.
[6:43:14] <%watts121> The Erdtree is literally forcing the world to have magic and shit.
[6:43:18] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Monke town?
[6:43:20] <NewWillinium> You'll find Azur at the very end of the path you are on now
[6:43:21] <James_Quivers> IT'S A WHOLE DAMN TOWN
[6:43:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> That move rocks
[6:43:27] <%Agami23> theres tons of nordic stuff in this game.
[6:43:35] <Ghufufin> elden ring has nods and references to norse myths but the world is not based around them
[6:43:36] <thewhiterice92> My god those bars are massive
[6:43:36] <Ricee> interesting, does enhancing right hand armament work with bows? @pabloelenano2
[6:43:37] <%greasypete00> avelyn?
[6:43:53] <+RushUnplugged> Ofnir is literally another name for Odin, there's a bunch of norse-based inspirations in it. Kinda like the Anor Londo royals were just the Shinto gods renamed
[6:43:55] <moneymoves2030> Samurai in my western rpg GTFO
[6:44:02] <%pabloelenano2> @Ricee  i havent try that
[6:44:13] <+ReallyBigRocks> monke town
[6:44:15] <James_Quivers> MONKE VILLAGE
[6:44:18] <+ReallyBigRocks> ook ook
[6:44:20] <Ricee> "You're beautiful"
[6:44:30] <TheSphereHunter> Hello PATREEEK!
[6:44:31] <rudiciuscaesar> MAGGIE lol
[6:44:36] <%greasypete00> have you come across the "im sorry" one of those yet
[6:44:36] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt grace right behind that boss
[6:44:36] <James_Quivers> MAGIC MONKE
[6:44:36] <+TheMuuj> aww everyone's beautiful
[6:44:37] <%pabloelenano2> maggie LUL
[6:44:37] <rudiciuscaesar> that's my German shepherd's name
[6:44:44] <%barrakuta371> You're beautiful it's true
[6:44:47] <%cade_calrayn> the sorcerers are up to some weird shit
[6:45:01] <Ghufufin> are all the demihuman queens M names?
[6:45:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Who do you yhink Made Demi Humans
[6:45:04] <Questiy> I like how Goldmask is implied to be more of a mathematical savant and less of a priest
[6:45:09] <krampus2> who do think taught demihumans magic
[6:45:12] <moneymoves2030> no damage run failed
[6:45:14] <%boggsz12> oh yeah what the fuck happened to jarren
[6:45:29] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The sorcerers were teaching the dogos to shoot magic
[6:45:37] <NewWillinium> You are killing SO many Bocs
[6:45:38] <kinkade_77> sorcery?
[6:46:01] <James_Quivers> Be sure to get those souls
[6:46:06] <%greasypete00> rock throw seems like the incantation version of the meteor sorcery, only cooler because youre actually throwing the rock
[6:46:06] <%Bluwizard21> azur is right up ahead on the left after this boss
[6:46:10] <kinkade_77> he uses so much mp damn
[6:46:10] <%Bluwizard21> easily misssed
[6:46:20] <%Bluwizard21> he lived!
[6:46:21] <Ghufufin> that was her sorcery teacher
[6:46:26] <%boggsz12> wow she never did that when i fought her
[6:46:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> give the monke a shotgun
[6:46:48] <Vermillion129> Azur my master
[6:46:50] <%pabloelenano2> who gives a monkey a shotgun
[6:46:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> FREAKERS
[6:46:59] <IminyourBase> is a dog
[6:47:01] <NewWillinium> She kind of reminds me of a Polar Bear for some reason
[6:47:05] <%Dakuu75> yeah, if sneak around here, it looks liek the Selians are actually teaching the demi-humans. like class-outside type stuff
[6:47:07] <%Bluwizard21> blast the bitch
[6:47:13] <+TheMuuj> Maggie seems nice
[6:47:14] <%luftraumm1> stone her
[6:47:23] <Zourath> Wizards: No sense of right and wrong
[6:47:30] <+RushUnplugged> WELL
[6:47:44] <moneymoves2030> wizards are never late tho
[6:47:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> this man bloodborned himself with crystals
[6:47:52] <+RushUnplugged> he is
[6:47:53] <NewWillinium> Maybe
[6:47:56] <NBUsagi> made of cyrstals
[6:47:56] <Ricee> he's moving
[6:47:56] <%justcallmebobplease> His hands are moving.
[6:47:57] <it_came_from_outer_space> gooood question
[6:47:57] <%greasypete00> you simply learn by being near him
[6:47:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> Dat Boy dead
[6:47:58] <%Bluwizard21> swing at him and find out
[6:47:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> he opens his hand
[6:47:59] <+hakumaribo> yeah he is
[6:47:59] <James_Quivers> He is, he's jsut made of crystals so he can't talk
[6:47:59] <TheBlankAce> He's a rock
[6:48:01] <+oAznoUta> hit him and check
[6:48:02] <Sigma_190_Beta> His left hand is moving.
[6:48:03] <%YakumoYomi> It's THE sorcery
[6:48:03] <rudiciuscaesar> bro is now inert?
[6:48:04] <akaSiggy> I think I saw his hand move
[6:48:04] <%Agami23> look with the monocular thing
[6:48:04] <%abakkus> it looked like his hands were moving
[6:48:04] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> kinda
[6:48:05] <+hakumaribo> he moves super slow
[6:48:08] <Midnight188> Kamehameha Get!
[6:48:09] <+RushUnplugged> he's just super-meditating
[6:48:20] <+tizziks> Seems like all the wizards are either dying or freezing up
[6:48:25] <it_came_from_outer_space> good job
[6:48:25] <%VHGS> pretty sure he literally replaced his skull with crystals
[6:48:33] <+ReallyBigRocks> he's got rocks on the inside
[6:48:37] <%JoshManVGH> That erdtree in the north there is the one I meant
[6:48:40] <NewWillinium> I apologize in advance for those two dungeons
[6:48:44] <%Puhff> Are all the demi-human queens named Maggie?
[6:48:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> You never replace ya face with crystals
[6:48:50] <James_Quivers> 'Cleared it" *will look at someone elses mao later and see 4 graces you didn't see*
[6:48:52] <%Agami23> i think you missed a catacomb to the east of draconic tree sentinel
[6:48:57] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt Actually, you are probably missing like fifty Sites of grace in Altus
[6:49:01] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[6:49:03] <%JoshManVGH> How DARE you content!
[6:49:08] <Ghufufin> did Pat get the new dragon power?
[6:49:08] <+PR0swagonist> nah pat is pretty strong, he can take these
[6:49:11] <+Grayhammatter> that doesn't sound good
[6:49:14] <%Dakuu75> LOL
[6:49:19] <+RushUnplugged> the implication is that reaching the peaks of sorcery makes you so fascinated with the stars that you stop doing anything else and just observe them
[6:49:21] <%DeadRuins> did you tho?
[6:49:24] <dante_must_die_exe> LUL
[6:49:27] <%notsoy> no you didn't explore it you bitch
[6:49:29] <%cade_calrayn> they said "probably"
[6:49:29] <+hakumaribo> how do you even get down?
[6:49:30] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  it isnt 50 but there are a number of graces um issed
[6:49:39] <%justcallmebobplease> BUT DID YOU THO?
[6:49:39] <+ReallyBigRocks> well good news, theres more for later
[6:49:39] <Sigma_190_Beta> Just jump straight down.
[6:49:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Both the dungeon and the boss are hell
[6:49:46] <%JoshManVGH> Would this game be evil enough to make invisible sites of grace? I'm going to hope not.
[6:49:49] <Wakerz140> I know you're missing one near the split in the road leading to the outer walls
[6:49:59] <%boggsz12> 300 part lp
[6:50:01] <Wakerz140> yeah
[6:50:03] <+ReallyBigRocks> yeh
[6:50:05] <%cade_calrayn> Yup!
[6:50:07] <ape_hawk> pat, you wanna check out the new dragon move?
[6:50:09] <%MaybeFalco> i can actually see where you missed a grace leading up capital stairway
[6:50:12] <%cade_calrayn> YOu are, it's right at the fork
[6:50:13] <%justcallmebobplease> There's no way Woolie will, with how he tunes you out if he doesn't want spoilers, and also tunes out chat.  But that's okay, that's not the content he makes.

[6:51:34] <+AyupaPupa> cmon bear get crazy
[6:51:36] <+Tyk1337> I love the existence, among all of the horrifying abominations present in this game, of simply larger-than-average bears
[6:52:02] <+RushUnplugged> @MisterAvry yep, very big enemies can swing at them and break them, there's usually smithing stones to get
[6:52:04] <+AyupaPupa> BEAR HUG

[6:52:12] <moneymoves2030> bear wug
[6:52:22] <%boggsz12> their grab does shockingly little damage
[6:52:24] <%Caped_Eggy> Those hugs do very little dmg for some reason
[6:52:26] <%Buttlo> Those bears will never not be terrifying.
[6:52:27] <it_came_from_outer_space> @Tyk1337 also ants, crawdads, crabs
[6:52:40] <+ReallyBigRocks> the bears are soft @Caped_Eggy
[6:52:43] <NewWillinium> I'm shocked that I've never found one of these Runebears as a boss
[6:52:45] <+zaddyforever> @tyk1337 i’ve sorta been assuming they’re called runebears bc they eat so many people and get their runes
[6:52:45] <Ghufufin> new dragon move?
[6:52:46] <%Bluwizard21> the less obvious one he calls it, little does he know

[6:52:58] <%RealThiele> crawdads can fuck off aint worth shit for souls and they hitscan your asshole
[6:53:00] <%cade_calrayn> Cool side note, Pat, lore says there's 16 Crucible Knights, and you can find at least 14 (so far) throughout the game
[6:53:13] <%Caped_Eggy> @ReallyBigRocks Not when I fought them LUL
[6:53:15] <+PR0swagonist> Oh its THIS one

[6:55:00] <%livi242> this one wasn't too bad for me
[6:55:03] <+Grayhammatter> and so it begins i guess
[6:55:13] <oda_flobunaga> This one's fun
[6:55:14] <moneymoves2030> they are literally just chalice dungeons they brought em back
[6:55:39] <Clyderso> Illusory!
[6:55:42] <dante_must_die_exe> that do be how DS2 team be though
[6:55:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> I fall for every trick every single time
[6:56:48] <tmvct1> rip chest
[6:56:57] <DanThePumpkinman> you just walked pas a chest i think
[6:57:03] <DanThePumpkinman> past*
[6:57:05] <%RealThiele> actually walked away form chest LUL
[6:57:06] <hitaker> wait did you just run by that other chest after teleporting
[6:57:18] <hitaker> patrick go backtrick
[6:57:19] <%X2Eliah> when you boomed in
[6:57:22] <DanThePumpkinman> right after you got teleported
[6:57:24] <+hakumaribo> someone told me that those gargoyle things move slower if your back is turned to them
[6:57:39] <%X2Eliah> so its just a door
[6:57:44] <hitaker> Jebaited
[6:57:47] <DanThePumpkinman> oh. was unaware they worked like that
[6:57:51] <%barrakuta371> teleport spots wow
[6:57:54] <Sunstalker> Kappa sure they are
[6:57:55] <Ricee> @hakumaribo certain enemies behave differently depending if you're looking at them or not
[6:58:13] <+Jeshk0> BIG PotFriend
[6:58:22] <%Pookiedaexzile> That Pot just let it rip
[6:58:29] <%Pookiedaexzile> Beyblade style
[6:58:35] <%tetraes> the way the jars explode into meat is quite satisfying
[6:58:38] <stinkyboyinc> why must we fight the pots they're so cute
[6:58:43] <SIydoc> pat theres a lever in there
[6:58:47] <+PR0swagonist> you can tell they had fun with this dungeon
[6:58:54] <dante_must_die_exe> big lost time
[6:58:57] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Mirrored layouts
[6:59:05] <%X2Eliah> you just need to find the invisible ceiling
[6:59:05] <%Agami23> this is my favorite catacombs
[6:59:23] <Sunstalker> the lever exists elsewhere
[6:59:31] <NewWillinium> I believe the lever is in the mirrored version of this room
[6:59:37] <Willowight> else
[7:00:05] <%justcallmebobplease> It's a mirror dungeon with identical room pairs, that's what a mirror dungeon is, innit?
[7:00:07] <+PR0swagonist> let him figure it out guys
[7:00:15] <Sunstalker> Well, cat's out the bag. There's a nasty trick to this place. It's like 2-3 identical dungeons connected to each other.
[7:00:23] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt 2 sets of identical maps
[7:00:25] <%Pookiedaexzile> One is a hub of sorts
[7:00:27] <Ricee> LUL
[7:00:33] <@Spydurman> oh no you passed by the Scrimblo armor set, the coolest one in the game Kappa
[7:00:37] <Willowight> whatt
[7:00:38] <%X2Eliah> yeah that's evil
[7:00:39] <%justcallmebobplease> THE FILTHIEST
[7:00:39] <+izanagi22> oh what the fuck
[7:00:41] <%YakumoYomi> psaOno psaOno psaOno
[7:00:43] <%justcallmebobplease> It's great!
[7:00:45] <+wizard_of_diamonds> LUL
[7:00:52] <+wizard_of_diamonds> BAMBOOZELED
[7:00:55] <%pabloelenano2> yeah when i realized i was so baffled
[7:00:55] <Willowight> god thats evil genius
[7:00:55] <%luftraumm1> filthy
[7:00:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> pat you need to find the scrimblo flame in mirror dungeon 6
[7:01:00] <%TheLemuroid> How many times have you called something "filthy" like that this stream
[7:01:07] <SIydoc> ok i had no idea this dungeon was mirrored, i guess i just got lucky when i went through it
[7:01:09] <%luftraumm1> but spoiled :(
[7:01:12] <%Agami23> we finally got to the point of a souls game just straight up gaslighting you
[7:01:23] <+PR0swagonist> but what about the invisible floor mirror?
[7:01:37] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt yeah, this place has multiple floors with identical layouts but slightly changed furniture and enemy placements
[7:01:38] <%livi242> there's another dungeon that really fucked with me later
[7:01:44] <%X2Eliah> this is actually also towers of hanoi
[7:01:45] <%Pookiedaexzile> These games have always lied to the player
[7:01:45] <Sunstalker> Paige doing this is gonna a trip
[7:01:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> Literal GASlighting.
[7:01:52] <Willowight> maybe leave rainbow stones?
[7:01:55] <%RealThiele> id use rainbow stones here
[7:01:56] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt This isn't the worse they do
[7:02:06] <Willowight> to remember which is which
[7:02:07] <+PR0swagonist> Paige will not have a good time
[7:02:12] <Sunstalker> this room will be the one with a lever
[7:02:24] <+Grayhammatter> well this is gonna be fun
[7:02:25] <%NouveauPunk> NouveauPunk subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! Hey Pat! Just wanted to say I started the Pillars of Eternity LP and I'm really enjoying it! Great stuff!
[7:02:25] <Sunstalker> just got to find the right one
[7:02:34] <%justcallmebobplease> YOU MUST COLLECT 70 STARS TO GET UP THESE STAIRS, MARIO
[7:02:41] <reasonance> you just did
[7:02:45] <reasonance> by falling off
[7:02:48] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Its real simple you go from one area to the next area, so just go through the same chest twice
[7:02:56] <+Jeshk0> dont give up, Skeleton!
[7:02:57] <%RealThiele> @justcallmebobplease Yahooyahooyayayayayayayayyayayayayahooo
[7:03:24] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh God. I'm imagining Paige in this dungeon.
[7:03:27] <%notsoy> i can't imagine paige trying to navigate this one
[7:03:28] <%luftraumm1> shouldn't have told YOU
[7:03:29] <%SveriSageAdvice> even if Paige was told about it, how long do you think it would take her to actually understand what is happening ol
[7:03:33] <bassoontyphoon> Tell her about what?
[7:03:33] <+Grayhammatter> but baba
[7:03:34] <Vermillion129> paige gonna love this LUL
[7:03:50] <%Bluwizard21> he still hasnt gotten it so
[7:03:53] <Willowight> itd be real funny if the last chest is a ds mimic
[7:04:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Someone start playing the clown music
[7:04:11] <Sunstalker> Goblin in his goblin wheel
[7:04:17] <+ReallyBigRocks> you're approaching level 18
[7:04:21] <Xelhesia> u were supposed to get the lever i think?
[7:04:29] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt To get to the switch go through the same chest you did to get on the ledge
[7:04:29] <moneymoves2030> I really want a Cuphead npc now
[7:04:34] <%justcallmebobplease> It's just like the DS3 DLC Spiral Stairs, Pat - you've got this!
[7:04:41] <+twenty112> I didn't like this one
[7:04:45] <+PR0swagonist> He thought
[7:04:48] <%Nobrev> PotFriend incoming
[7:04:56] <%justcallmebobplease> We've been referencing it in chat already, yes.

[7:05:12] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt DIG UP STUPID
[7:05:19] <%Pookiedaexzile> No one tell him
[7:05:21] <%X2Eliah> Pat bring out the pen and paper and draw a map of each copy of the dungeon and how the doors link to each other
[7:05:23] <+Grayhammatter> just dig up stupid
[7:05:25] <RemedyofRevenge> this mustve been the dungeon that the horizon devs played
[7:05:40] <%RealThiele> but baba
[7:05:41] <$SGrim> And avacado tastes like shit
[7:05:48] <%X2Eliah> Why do people from the US always love guacamole
[7:05:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> Oh no what has  Pat Done
[7:05:49] <%luftraumm1> avocado is GREAT
[7:05:54] <NewWillinium> Guacamole always just tasted like cold wet mushy lettice to me.
[7:05:55] <stinkyboyinc> paige gaslighting pat while the game gaslights pat
[7:06:03] <Sigma_190_Beta> Guac is fine, Avacado is bad.
[7:06:03] <IminyourBase> avocado? IN THIS ECONIMIC CLIMATE?!?!?
[7:06:04] <%zwolf42> avocado is top tier vegetable
[7:06:04] <%TheLemuroid> Say you avoid avacado for environmental reasons
[7:06:04] <%radiorosewater> Avacado is basic af
[7:06:04] <%Nobrev> I love avocado
[7:06:04] <%Pookiedaexzile> Southwesterns are gonna riot
[7:06:06] <Ricee> because guacamole is amazing and simple to make
[7:06:07] <moneymoves2030> avocado taste like shit but I heard it cures cancer who'd of thunk
[7:06:08] <+polothegreatest> guacamole is da bomb
[7:06:11] <DanThePumpkinman> guac is just spicy avocado. if you dont like avocado your not gona like guac
[7:06:12] <RyuuAoi> WTF Pat! Avocado is amazing!
[7:06:12] <%Dakuu75> Can't hear paige, so it just sounds liek Pat is talking to himself
[7:06:15] <+TheMuuj> if your guac tastes like avocado it's too bland
[7:06:17] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt I hate avacado and my brothers family are argentinian and they look at me like a freak
[7:06:19] <@PrefectusCorgi> Snek EATER
[7:06:21] <%cade_calrayn> Pat, how can you expect Paige to remember something you've only told her a dozen times?
[7:06:21] <RyuuAoi> Guacamole is god like
[7:06:22] <+MisterAvry> I don't like avacado either
[7:06:23] <Willowight> avacado makes me nauseous
[7:06:29] <%X2Eliah> yup
[7:06:30] <$SGrim> @X2Eliah I'm from California, Anything with avocado fucking sucks, and it's everywhere here.
[7:06:31] <Sunstalker> Pat, drop similar amounts of sparkling stones outside each chest and location it drops you
[7:06:31] <moneymoves2030> it cures cancer tho
[7:06:32] <%X2Eliah> all done
[7:06:33] <+Grayhammatter> sure
[7:06:33] <+PR0swagonist> now figure out how to get back

[7:09:45] <%Buttlo> @NewWillinium If I'm near a cliff I dismount and turn around to safety before re-mounting.
[7:09:47] <%X2Eliah> is this like the other hero's grave

[7:10:57] <%luftraumm1> you prefer dungenis?
[7:11:04] <Clyderso> This is the easiest dungeon
[7:11:05] <+thugnasty117> Cataussy
[7:11:08] <+Grayhammatter> that's a sword
[7:11:12] <moneymoves2030> Avocadoguacmolenussy
[7:11:24] <%cade_calrayn> Catacussy?
[7:11:28] <reasonance> sunlight straight sword
[7:11:30] <%cade_calrayn> Catacombussy
[7:11:41] <moneymoves2030> that's just straight up Fiona from Shrek 2
[7:11:42] <+silent__chief> good luck lol
[7:11:43] <HotSauceFiend> OH THIS one
[7:11:43] <+ReallyBigRocks> Catacussy is strong
[7:11:48] <%rumtumtugnutz> Catacussy is better
[7:11:49] <+thickshield> ohno
[7:11:51] <%pabloelenano2> he dosnt know
[7:11:53] <%cade_calrayn> Chariotussy
[7:11:55] <Ricee> oh fuck this dungeon
[7:11:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Fuck this one
[7:11:57] <Therusher> Oh no I did this one yesterday
[7:11:57] <Midnight188> Cataclussy. like a cataclysm but sexy.
[7:11:58] <%RealThiele> this smells like chariot
[7:11:58] <+izanagi22> I thought I recognized those tracks
[7:12:00] <%livi242> I hate these things so much
[7:12:02] <NewWillinium> It is the WORST Chariot one
[7:12:03] <+silent__chief> took me  2 days
[7:12:05] <%pabloelenano2> froggen time
[7:12:07] <+AyupaPupa> chariussy
[7:12:13] <nertiaa> true nightmare
[7:12:16] <%notsoy> they really run this one back five times? jesus
[7:12:17] <+twenty112> Catacooms
[7:12:18] <+jennyfurific> lol nope
[7:12:19] <%boggsz12> have fun, hope you like chariots
[7:12:19] <+izanagi22> Oh god that's a lot of souls at stake
[7:12:19] <+thickshield> just... ohno
[7:12:22] <%MrMegaJackpots> I wanted to uninstall here
[7:12:28] <%livi242> I somehow cleared this and don't know how I did
[7:12:31] <SIydoc> @NewWillinium nah its not as bad as the lava chariot one
[7:12:34] <Midnight188> Executioner's Chariussy
[7:12:35] <%Pookiedaexzile> CataCussy
[7:12:38] <+AyupaPupa> trick is don't die :)
[7:12:39] <reasonance> @izanagi22 it's okay he's already huge he doesnt need them LUL
[7:12:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> its super obvious
[7:12:40] <Clyderso> the only trick is skill
[7:12:46] <Wakerz140> you go while it heads up behind you
[7:12:47] <%RealThiele> lava chariot was infuriating
[7:12:47] <Therusher> Same trick as all souls games: git gud
[7:12:50] <%cade_calrayn> Genuinely, it might be more fun to just go into the Capital for tonight, Pat
[7:12:50] <moneymoves2030> Astoras straight nussy
[7:12:51] <+thugnasty117> That's a big man baby
[7:12:52] <HotSauceFiend> I don't even own this game yet and I know this dungeon is a pain
[7:12:57] <+ReallyBigRocks> do not get hit by the big chariot
[7:12:58] <%notsoy> how many souls do you need to level up at this point, 200k?
[7:12:58] <%luftraumm1> soulussy
[7:13:00] <NewWillinium> The Trick is that the Statue summoning them is part of the trick
[7:13:07] <rosemon5001> cant wait for the time he learns how to kill them
[7:13:09] <%Pookiedaexzile> Git Gussy
[7:13:10] <bassoontyphoon> Rip 152k runes
[7:13:24] <%MrMegaJackpots> lol
[7:13:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[7:13:25] <LuminusVows> LUL

[7:13:27] <NanoHologuise> LUL
[7:13:27] <%SveriSageAdvice> there is one part though that you might need help on, it took me a long ass while to figure it out

[7:13:28] <+PR0swagonist> Two of them

[7:13:31] <stinkyboyinc> doublussy

[7:13:32] <NanoHologuise> fuck this dungeon
[7:13:33] <%Pookiedaexzile> Two of those
[7:13:34] <HotSauceFiend> you thought
[7:13:35] <IminyourBase> SKELETON WARRIOR
[7:13:36] <+Metaternal> Walked right into that one
[7:13:36] <Willowight> wow, thats mean
[7:13:38] <%notsoy> this is miyazaki's favorite new gimmick
[7:13:42] <%cade_calrayn> It was even IN VIEW
[7:13:43] <%justcallmebobplease> Honestly you should have expected that
[7:13:44] <%SveriSageAdvice> for real fuck this dungeon
[7:13:44] <Midnight188> always two there are
[7:13:49] <Ricee> LUL
[7:13:51] <+AyupaPupa> word
[7:13:53] <Clyderso> fair enough
[7:13:55] <%RealThiele> Watch man become Chariot sandwich
[7:13:56] <TwistParabola> lets gooooo
[7:13:58] <%cade_calrayn> Like you said "I  see" when the other chariot was on screen
[7:13:58] <%MrMegaJackpots> busted by a chairussy
[7:13:58] <%tetraes> i hated this one so much lol
[7:13:59] <RyuuAoi> Funhouse
[7:14:00] <jubejube56> Chariot swamp
[7:14:01] <hentaimaxer> fair
[7:14:05] <SIydoc> your characters gonna look a lot cooler after this
[7:14:13] <TheSandmanIsHere> Behold, gravity!
[7:14:14] <HotSauceFiend> wait this game has invisible platforms
[7:14:20] <Xiangchang> This is one of those dungeons you look up and just shake your head.
[7:14:28] <boostergoldz> i'm surprised there's no illusory bottomless pits
[7:14:30] <NanoHologuise> I forget whether it's this one or the one in the next area that's worse
[7:14:32] <Willowight> wait did that chariot teleport in?
[7:14:32] <IminyourBase> Stone Chariot is the new Skeleton Ball
[7:14:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> illusory platforming Kreygasm
[7:14:48] <TwistParabola> HELLO
[7:14:50] <NewWillinium> But just wait! There's more!
[7:14:58] <TwistParabola> "hello there"
[7:15:04] <IminyourBase> oh god, he made them look sadder this time
[7:15:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Petrifussy

[7:15:22] <%Dustin_Gunn> just beat commander naill, fuuuuck that guy
[7:15:25] <nertiaa> the rumpus
[7:15:27] <%X2Eliah> so with the things being here, Elden Ring is confirmed to be a dark souls, question is, is ER a DS0 or a DS 4
[7:15:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> Death Blussy
[7:15:36] <%TheLemuroid> This dungeon fucks
[7:15:36] <Willowight> its like trying to cross a highway
[7:15:39] <NanoHologuise> LUL
[7:15:43] <%pabloelenano2> elden froggen
[7:15:44] <TwistParabola> yeah this dungeon is advanced fuckery
[7:15:48] <+nayre> I hate these dungeons
[7:15:49] <boostergoldz> headshot
[7:15:50] <+ReallyBigRocks> you don't HAVE to do it
[7:15:50] <+Grayhammatter> yeah, this seems like ass
[7:15:52] <+jennyfurific> this one only gets better and better the deeper you go in
[7:15:52] <%DEETRz> oh god you're in that hero grave
[7:15:53] <+ReallyBigRocks> :)
[7:15:54] <%boggsz12> yeahhhh
[7:15:55] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt If you think this is bad just wait
[7:16:08] <RyuuAoi> LUL
[7:16:11] <+TheMuuj> or they haven't gone a little too far enough
[7:16:12] <+izanagi22> I mean this can still be bad
[7:16:12] <%pabloelenano2> dont tell him
[7:16:16] <%X2Eliah> Pat why dont you summon some multiplayer people here
[7:16:16] <boostergoldz> there's a cool trick you can do with niall
[7:16:16] <%tetraes> @PatStaresAt  it gets worse lol
[7:16:17] <SIydoc> at least this dungeon doesnt have invincible enemies
[7:16:20] <hentaimaxer> stoopzzKKona
[7:16:20] <%RealThiele> Mostly Self-inflicted
[7:16:20] <%dOjOTron> @PatStaresAt how many hours are you in?
[7:16:29] <Ghufufin> we were expecting poison swamps in poison swamps but what we got was worse
[7:16:34] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt imagine the Anor Londo archers with this game's approach to platforming
[7:16:36] <jubejube56> Pat it’s optional this is fine, you don’t have to find the scrimblos
[7:16:36] <TwistParabola> we need to tell him for this one
[7:16:36] <%pabloelenano2> he lacks vital information
[7:16:38] <%Bluwizard21> noone tell him he got a freebie on the side tomb
[7:16:59] <%Dakuu75> (I wanna go back to Limgrave... when things were simple.)
[7:16:59] <NBUsagi> wiff
[7:17:01] <+ReallyBigRocks> fuck me
[7:17:01] <Vermillion129> noooo LUL
[7:17:02] <stinkyboyinc> omg
[7:17:05] <TwistParabola> F
[7:17:08] <+jennyfurific> lol
[7:17:08] <stinkyboyinc> falljoke
[7:17:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> lmao at least you figured out a whole 20 minutes sooner than i did
[7:17:11] <%DEETRz> i hated that hero grave so much
[7:17:11] <%barrakuta371> LUL
[7:17:11] <TheSandmanIsHere> LUL
[7:17:12] <hentaimaxer> airball
[7:17:16] <%X2Eliah> why would you jump instead of falling
[7:17:16] <Sigma_190_Beta> :)
[7:17:19] <TwistParabola> Yes
[7:17:20] <ClarentMordred> man I did this tomb yesterday and it sucks
[7:17:20] <+jennyfurific> THey can and they did
[7:17:21] <RyuuAoi> #easy. See
[7:17:21] <TheSandmanIsHere> behold, gravity! again!
[7:17:23] <TwistParabola> he can!
[7:17:24] <r0flwaffles> this is ur reward for overleveling
[7:17:25] <TwistParabola> he did!
[7:17:25] <Sunstalker> That part is optional
[7:17:26] <%pabloelenano2> @Dakuu75  thats never gona happend again
[7:17:27] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt It's Sen all over again Mother fucker
[7:17:29] <Sunstalker> BUT ITS GOOD THO
[7:17:32] <ClarentMordred> its not as bad as you think it is, but its annoying
[7:17:42] <HotSauceFiend> the full dark souls experience condensed in one dungeon
[7:17:42] <%livi242> levels can't help you here
[7:17:42] <+GrateMan> It's not different at all! Is it Steve?!
[7:17:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> IT SUPER IS
[7:17:49] <%SveriSageAdvice> do you want to know something that will help with that part a little better now that you know its there @PatStaresAt
[7:17:53] <Ricee> I love Frogger
[7:18:01] <%X2Eliah> they probably knew pwople would be overlevelled as heck for this, so they had to add difficulty in other ways
[7:18:04] <%Buttlo> That's too much describing this game from the very first dungeon onward.
[7:18:20] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can't lie, this shit is kinda awesome
[7:18:25] <+jennyfurific> nice first try on that fall
[7:18:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> wow nice, nvm then he got down there rather easy lol
[7:18:28] <%JoshManVGH> No!
[7:18:33] <%cade_calrayn> wait, WHAT? I have not seen this part of the dungeon!?!
[7:18:37] <TwistParabola> it is!
[7:18:40] <+jennyfurific> i fucked that one up like 5 times
[7:18:45] <Xelhesia> LUL
[7:18:45] <oda_flobunaga> It's just Sen's Fortress AGAIN I LOVE IT
[7:18:49] <%JoshManVGH> I've already been down here! I don't want to go back for this!
[7:18:50] <Sunstalker> At least no swinging blades
[7:18:51] <%DEETRz> this part was so hidden but man the rewards were so great
[7:18:53] <+Grayhammatter> down LUL
[7:19:02] <Willowight> those look like trafks
[7:19:07] <Willowight> tracks
[7:19:09] <%SveriSageAdvice> if anyone wants slightly more timing on that, the chariots dont quite have their hitboxes touch the direct center of those pillars on the right side
[7:19:11] <moneymoves2030> you know what this area is missing dragonslayer archers
[7:19:27] <boostergoldz> this game has like 4 different versions of rock throw
[7:19:28] <%X2Eliah> Eeeeey now Pat can summon more Pats
[7:19:40] <%Pookiedaexzile> If American Developers saw this They'd shit themselves
[7:19:47] <Sigma_190_Beta> This area is missing some Anor Londo archers.
[7:19:47] <TwistParabola> @X2Eliah bruh
[7:19:53] <+silent__chief> there's like 12 shrine of amanas in this game
[7:19:56] <moneymoves2030> they didn't go far ENUFF
[7:19:59] <%DEETRz> its a trap
[7:19:59] <hentaimaxer> @pookiedaexzile stoopzzKKona
[7:20:02] <Jogsy29__> that rock throw reminds me the max upgraded version of spartan rage from GOW 2018
[7:20:03] <Sunstalker> go back
[7:20:07] <%justcallmebobplease> Look up?
[7:20:08] <%pabloelenano2> this is the instant death swamp
[7:20:10] <oda_flobunaga> @moneymoves2030 how about that 1 Gaol though?
[7:20:10] <SIydoc> take the other path now
[7:20:12] <%boggsz12> to hurt you
[7:20:12] <+jennyfurific> there is no point
[7:20:13] <NewWillinium> Go back
[7:20:14] <%X2Eliah> its kinda obvious
[7:20:15] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> GO BACK
[7:20:16] <%justcallmebobplease> Is there something to drop on him, or a place to jump?
[7:20:16] <RyuuAoi> @pookiedaexzile They would make it easier to accommodate the American player
[7:20:19] <%JoshManVGH> Could go further. Could ALSO be a swamp!
[7:20:20] <%X2Eliah> like you even get a floodlight
[7:20:22] <%dOjOTron> this is justa mess dude geez
[7:20:22] <Latin_Plague> I saw throwing rocks ability and it reminded me of of a certain real world conflict and it bugs me that I thought of that. xD
[7:20:25] <%ultimafreya> deth
[7:20:29] <hentaimaxer> NotLikeThis
[7:20:31] <RyuuAoi> Robots, Pat.
[7:20:42] <%X2Eliah> yeah this dungeon really needs a DoT effect
[7:20:55] <%boggsz12> i love this game, but it just keeps escalating
[7:21:02] <+Grayhammatter> fear...
[7:21:06] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[7:21:07] <bassoontyphoon> Seriously why isn’t this dungeon covered in poison at least
[7:21:07] <Xelhesia> LUL
[7:21:09] <%livi242> this area needs scarlet Rot gas
[7:21:11] <NewWillinium> This is why I was apologizing in chat earlier
[7:21:22] <%D00msDayDan> yeah that'll do it
[7:21:23] <%X2Eliah> playing as pure melee must suck
[7:21:24] <%DEETRz> fyi pat the wondrous physick that has a shield will block one chariot hit
[7:21:28] <+jennyfurific> first try
[7:21:32] <rosemon5001> dont go on the side of the skelly it doesnt target you that way
[7:21:34] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> The only thing missing on this dungeon is the rot
[7:21:41] <%cade_calrayn> pure melee is impossible in this game
[7:21:41] <%Niney_Who> Yeah this point in the game Dungeons start becoming intentionally Hellish
[7:21:50] <%boggsz12> i'm so thankful for my 60 vit
[7:21:54] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Hey @PatStaresAt just got a cloth wet
[7:21:55] <+Grayhammatter> wtf was that?
[7:21:56] <RyuuAoi> Imagine five more archers down there. It's fine. Ha
[7:21:59] <+silent__chief> lol
[7:22:02] <TwistParabola> LUL
[7:22:12] <Sunstalker> What this needs is Radahn riding one of these chariots
[7:22:13] <+jennyfurific> up first
[7:22:14] <%Niney_Who> Seek up
[7:22:16] <@Spydurman> that's a good message
[7:22:17] <%radiorosewater> teaowlOhno teaowlConcern
[7:22:18] <%cade_calrayn> down I think
[7:22:21] <Sigma_190_Beta> Up First.
[7:22:22] <+jennyfurific> its on the right
[7:22:23] <%JoshManVGH> Down
[7:22:24] <Xiangchang> You're gonna need to go down.
[7:22:25] <TwistParabola> i think down
[7:22:25] <+Grayhammatter> seek up stupid
[7:22:26] <%cade_calrayn> oh up then lol
[7:22:26] <embarrassedhonk> Oh thank god its just more chariots

[7:22:31] <+lord_sykos> seek up
[7:22:33] <%DEETRz> you gotta go down
[7:22:36] <moneymoves2030> levitate miracle would be good
[7:22:43] <Sunstalker> corner opened up
[7:22:45] <Jogsy29__> Lover???
[7:22:46] <DanThePumpkinman> dig up stupid
[7:22:46] <RyuuAoi> Commit
[7:22:55] <tanarath> lantern?
[7:23:02] <Sunstalker> the outside corner should be a path
[7:23:07] <NewWillinium> Okay I *think* it's up. There's a summoning statue thing that you need to hit to solve this damnable death trap
[7:23:07] <+ReallyBigRocks> NotLikeThis
[7:23:16] <Vermillion129> WUT
[7:23:18] <+Grayhammatter> WHAT?
[7:23:18] <%pabloelenano2> LUL
[7:23:19] <%X2Eliah> uh
[7:23:19] <%cade_calrayn> Elevator time!
[7:23:20] <%JoshManVGH> Haha
[7:23:21] <Sunstalker> Now hit this and leace it up.
[7:23:21] <%boggsz12> lmao
[7:23:23] <Willowight> so mean
[7:23:24] <%JoshManVGH> Wtf
[7:23:25] <TwistParabola> HERE WE GO
[7:23:27] <%cade_calrayn> It's an elevator y'all
[7:23:28] <Wakerz140> that helps elsewhere iirc
[7:23:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> Elevator.
[7:23:30] <Sunstalker> Even if YOU DIE, ITS FINE IF ITS LIKE THIS
[7:23:31] <Jogsy29__> they went on full Indiana Jones bullshit lmaooo
[7:23:31] <%livi242> I still don't know what the deal with this is
[7:23:32] <%cade_calrayn> you stand on it
[7:23:33] <NewWillinium> Aaaaaand you got it.  That will solve a chain reaction
[7:23:39] <+jennyfurific> you wanna keep that up
[7:23:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> not elevator
[7:23:46] <NewWillinium> Look up at the top of the pillar.
[7:23:46] <Sunstalker> Leave it up, Pat.
[7:23:51] <%cade_calrayn> OH
[7:23:55] <Sunstalker> Death won't undo it
[7:23:56] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> you can die now
[7:24:00] <%cade_calrayn> OH yeah it finishes the floor above, Pat
[7:24:03] <Vermillion129> this sucks LUL
[7:24:07] <+jennyfurific> now good luck getting back down
[7:24:07] <%cade_calrayn> it finishes the floor to make a Light circle
[7:24:08] <%dOjOTron> is the fire rotating?
[7:24:09] <NewWillinium> But yeah you want to leave it up. Dying doesn't matter
[7:24:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> finally
[7:24:15] <+jennyfurific> youll see
[7:24:16] <%livi242> yeah that worked for me
[7:24:18] <stinkyboyinc> sometimes you just gotta die
[7:24:19] <Sunstalker> Its just faster
[7:24:21] <+Grayhammatter> what?
[7:24:23] <%X2Eliah> the f*** is a light circle
[7:24:25] <TwistParabola> it's fine
[7:24:26] <%DEETRz> its scuffed but you'll see
[7:24:30] <+silent__chief> I had to wiki the torch solution
[7:24:31] <TwistParabola> you'll be fine
[7:24:33] <Sunstalker> Now go into the dungeon to where the double chariots was
[7:24:35] <rosemon5001> Sadge didnt figure out you can kill them
[7:24:36] <TheSandmanIsHere> a shame it doesn't set the chariot on fire
[7:24:44] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I don't know but it works
[7:24:44] <SIydoc> wait isnt there anothe path too?
[7:24:51] <%zwolf42> this particular dungeon is just too much
[7:24:53] <domukujira> oh god not this place
[7:24:59] <%SveriSageAdvice> he actually super didnt need to die, he couldve raced the other trap to get the same result
[7:25:00] <%DEETRz> theres another path but you need to bring a damage shield physick
[7:25:03] <moneymoves2030> wherethechariotsmeetyourface
[7:25:13] <+thehatch20> I couldn’t figure this one out when I did it
[7:25:21] <%greasypete00> man the radahn fight sucks ass on pc
[7:25:23] <+ReallyBigRocks> :O
[7:25:26] <+Grayhammatter> wait, what?

[7:25:49] <%JoshManVGH> HOW!?
[7:25:50] <Willowight> what
[7:25:51] <%barrakuta371> Uhhhh
[7:25:51] <%justcallmebobplease> You made chariots collide
[7:25:51] <%DEETRz> hitting the pillar causes the chariots to do that for some reason
[7:25:52] <%X2Eliah> OH so it raised a spawner
[7:25:53] <SIydoc> it spawned one in the middle and they crashed into each other
[7:25:53] <Ricee> a crash on the highway NotLikeThis
[7:25:53] <TwistParabola> You summoned another one in the middle and they crashed
[7:25:54] <$Jaxnos> do you believe in magic? in a young pat's heart?
[7:25:55] <Jogsy29__> you activated the light, which made them brittle i think
[7:26:00] <%SveriSageAdvice> @PatStaresAt the first trap you hit had one of those glowy statues, spawning an additional one
[7:26:00] <+Grayhammatter> that's fucking WACK
[7:26:03] <ElSuperNova> Well eat shit Tree sent LUL

[7:26:12] <%cade_calrayn> Golden Pat
[7:26:13] <%DEETRz> you did it
[7:26:14] <Therusher> You brought up the trap pillar which completed a teleport circle, forcing the chariots to teleport and collide
[7:26:15] <TwistParabola> Tree!
[7:26:16] <NewWillinium> You did it!
[7:26:17] <+jennyfurific> thats it
[7:26:18] <+blitz31295> the pilar cretaes the light circle and spawns another chariot
[7:26:19] <Wakerz140> you did it
[7:26:20] <+tizziks> That set with skelly head would be sweet as well
[7:26:22] <SIydoc> you did it, now for the boss
[7:26:23] <%X2Eliah> I mean did you fihgt a boss
[7:26:23] <TwistParabola> ya did it!

[7:26:25] <Wakerz140> now beat the boss
[7:26:27] <Sigma_190_Beta> @PatStaresAt The pillar made them collide.
[7:26:28] <TheBlankAce> You caused a traffic accident essentially
[7:26:29] <TwistParabola> oh but go back the other way still
[7:26:30] <+ReallyBigRocks> get stronger
[7:26:32] <%cade_calrayn> You completed a light circle and killed them, Pat

[7:26:37] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt U DI IT
[7:26:40] <+Grayhammatter> just beat the boss now i guess?
[7:26:40] <ElSuperNova> The fattest of rolls
[7:26:42] <+jennyfurific> there is another thing down that chariot path with the fire statue tho
[7:26:43] <Willowight> chariot pileup?
[7:26:44] <RyuuAoi> You beat Elden Ring
[7:26:46] <+jennyfurific> i think
[7:26:48] <+lord_sykos> theres an item back near the pillar you can get now
[7:26:48] <Sunstalker> This circle is new, it's what you caused and what broke them
[7:26:56] <reasonance> embrace the fat
[7:26:58] <NewWillinium> . . Oh yeah speaking of too heayy, did you ever fight the Knights of the Great Jar in Caelid? You'll get a Amulet for Carry Weight.
[7:26:59] <TwistParabola> you still didnt go down the other way
[7:27:01] <Saturation_Lizard> now enjoy the worst boss fight in the game :)

[7:27:18] <ClarentMordred> now for the fun part
[7:27:19] <TwistParabola> @NewWillinium he must have, he has the talisman
[7:27:22] <SIydoc> this fight is bad but not the worst
[7:27:26] <+Grayhammatter> this dungeon seems scuffed
[7:27:45] <+ReallyBigRocks> that's clean
[7:27:56] <+GrateMan> Golden Bat!
[7:27:56] <NewWillinium> @NewWillinium Ooh does he? I know that there are several levels of that Talisman
[7:28:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> One expensive corpse
[7:28:04] <%luftraumm1> put boots too and keep your knife
[7:28:10] <TheSandmanIsHere> Elden Bling
[7:28:14] <Sunstalker> Grayhammatter Its expected that you'd make it back up that ladder and watch it happen but they were kind enough to save progress through death
[7:28:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> untouchable

[7:29:34] <SaintBeau> OMEGALUL
[7:29:35] <$OfficerMods> Every time this man dies I cheer
[7:29:37] <ElSuperNova> Not even his final form LUL
[7:29:42] <$Jaxnos> let me go grab my dinner, i have some time
[7:29:43] <marenrethew> tiche did so much damage holly shit
[7:29:43] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Alright guys, who kills their opponent first, Pat or Tiche?
[7:29:47] <Wakerz140> Fun fact, this dungeon drops TWO of my favorite armor sets
[7:29:53] <Midnight188> "Naw git gud binch" - miyazaki
[7:29:54] <+MarkoTolstov> and this is where Mimic + KAMEHAMEHA + infinite FP potion comes in handy
[7:29:58] <domukujira> big shield time
[7:29:58] <SIydoc> honestly probably easier to kill the spear one first since it doesnt have a shield
[7:30:00] <tanarath> can you upgrade armor like weapons?
[7:30:00] <hentaimaxer> every time I die this man cheers
[7:30:02] <+RayDaug> This was pretty much the exact point I gave up any sense of playing fair and just started hoarfrost stomping my problems away
[7:30:15] <SaintBeau> LUL
[7:30:26] <oda_flobunaga> At Least it isn't Commander O'niel and Mogh
[7:30:28] <moneymoves2030> parry coward
[7:30:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> god thats sick
[7:30:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> that lighting looks great
[7:30:58] <+5Two> Ornstein and... Ornstein
[7:30:58] <$Jaxnos> oh no my dinner
[7:31:04] <+Shikuru> WOOT SKULLGIRLS BACK AT EVO!
[7:31:09] <%cade_calrayn> this is the leader of the Crucible Knights
[7:31:12] <Ricee> Mogh isn't that bad, these double Crucible fights suck @oda_flobunaga
[7:31:16] <%cade_calrayn> He's the boss of the bosses
[7:31:21] <NBUsagi> Tail swips
[7:31:30] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Where do you find the wing spell?
[7:31:41] <reasonance> you don't
[7:31:44] <RyuuAoi> Fuck that guy
[7:31:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Not So fun when Paladin starts getting Smited
[7:31:55] <Sunstalker> They"re cooler then Black Knights but BK armor looks better
[7:31:57] <oda_flobunaga> @Ricee I Know.  I was making a reference to O&S and that was the closest I could Get with Elden Ring characters
[7:32:01] <reasonance> horn, tail, and breath are the only crucible spells you can get AFAIK
[7:32:01] <SaintBeau> LUL
[7:32:01] <%dOjOTron> got greedy
[7:32:02] <%Bluwizard21> It's great that Fromsoft finally paid attention to it's player base and said "wow O&S really get a lot of popularity, let's make like 9 of them in elden ring"
[7:32:02] <+LastnameSilverLastname> G R E E D
[7:32:03] <+Grayhammatter> oh no
[7:32:04] <hentaimaxer> ez
[7:32:05] <+hakumaribo> oh god two of them?

[7:32:05] <+NeonFishFace> GREEDY
[7:32:06] <+Shikuru> should've healed
[7:32:06] <%cade_calrayn> oooooooooooof
[7:32:07] <tanarath> greed
[7:32:07] <wildy333> Damn
[7:32:07] <+silent__chief> ouch

[7:32:09] <%JoshManVGH> Fuuucking trade
[7:32:10] <+PR0swagonist> Slime is hanging in there
[7:32:11] <+Grayhammatter> that greed
[7:32:16] <%DEETRz> its not too bad of a fight with mimic bro
[7:32:16] <%luftraumm1> trade
[7:32:20] <Vermillion129> where were the eel
[7:32:20] <%DEETRz> yup
[7:32:20] <$Jaxnos> bring back the misbegotten and crucible knight fight
[7:32:22] <TheSandmanIsHere> got greedy rather than heal
[7:32:22] <SaintBeau> yes
[7:32:24] <%AyotoCorp> You can
[7:32:24] <ClarentMordred> you can parry them
[7:32:25] <+Grayhammatter> yes, you can
[7:32:25] <Xelhesia> yes
[7:32:26] <+Panquake25> yes
[7:32:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> this really is a bossfight from both sides
[7:32:26] <RyuuAoi> Doable
[7:32:28] <$Jaxnos> i miss that one after this
[7:32:28] <Saturation_Lizard> yes but it really isn't worth it
[7:32:29] <TwistParabola> Yes!
[7:32:30] <+PR0swagonist> yep
[7:32:30] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt You can parry all their shit
[7:32:31] <$OfficerMods> probally i just guard countered him to death
[7:32:33] <%boggsz12> you can parry almost every sword swing
[7:32:38] <%AyotoCorp> Parrying them is pretty easy when there's not two of them
[7:32:38] <%nerxiv> sword guy is super easy to parry
[7:32:41] <Sunstalker> Yes, even the double piroute move and the dash
[7:32:42] <digaogrunge> you can
[7:32:49] <%Pookiedaexzile> No Pat YOU can't Parry them
[7:32:51] <tanarath> the crucible knight apparently has tighter timings than normal enemies, but you can.
[7:33:02] <moneymoves2030> wow he gives a big fuck you out the gate everytime
[7:33:04] <+RushUnplugged> mimic-chan is always the goat
[7:33:05] <reasonance> they really got a lot of mileage out of this boss theme track
[7:33:06] <TwistParabola> mimic mvp
[7:33:46] <%livi242> mimic tanks so much damage
[7:33:48] <wildy333> ouch
[7:33:49] <NewWillinium> We get so many of their moves. Can you get the Protoss Hook or the Winged Dive as incantations?
[7:34:02] <$Jaxnos> get in there yeyeyeyeyeye

[7:35:18] <%NBUsagi> i can now use custome PatStaresAt emotes psaGotcha
[7:35:18] <%Fenrisulfr_V> Those pauldrons. /chef's kiss/
[7:35:19] <%Willowight> thanks
[7:35:27] <%X2Eliah> Yeah this game really loves Faith more than Int
[7:35:31] <+izanagi22> Oh that's speedy too
[7:35:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> YEYEYEYE
[7:35:35] <%JoshManVGH> Its the one from the network test!
[7:35:37] <moneymoves2030> D scaling is pretty meh
[7:35:40] <ElSuperNova> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[7:35:41] <TheSandmanIsHere> fast greatsword
[7:35:52] <%luftraumm1> favorite look right there
[7:35:52] <%tetraes> whats the r2?
[7:35:52] <NewWillinium> Scaling does improve as you invest into it
[7:35:53] <%Transatlantic_Dylan> Transatlantic_Dylan subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Long time listener first time caller, when’s mahvel
[7:35:54] <ClarentMordred> its only d scaling cause its not upgraded
[7:35:54] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's scaling is bad though.
[7:35:54] <RyuuAoi> Looking good!
[7:36:09] <TheSandmanIsHere> @moneymoves2030 probably goes to B by +6 at latest
[7:36:09] <%Agami23> @X2Eliah nah, this game loves strength faith and dex int
[7:36:11] <%X2Eliah> scaling goes up only when you upgrade stuff
[7:36:13] <ClarentMordred> all the scaling improves as you level up the weapon on all weapons
[7:36:18] <+RushUnplugged> it's +0, it's probably gonna get to B scaling at least
[7:36:22] <XxMoliciousxX> think this is my favorite armor set
[7:36:25] <SIydoc> has pat been to the divine tower of caelid?
[7:36:26] <domukujira> cool sword
[7:36:33] <moneymoves2030> it looks rad
[7:36:34] <reasonance> I've noticed a LOT of the unique str/faith weapons lean heavily on str with weak faith scaling
[7:36:34] <TwistParabola> yayyyy
[7:36:37] <ElSuperNova> Super armor?
[7:36:39] <Ghufufin> new dragon move?
[7:36:41] <NewWillinium> Pat has done the Divine Tower of Caelid
[7:36:43] <%NBUsagi> I like how the Crucible Knights are basically beast knights, its pretty metal
[7:36:55] <NewWillinium> Don't you have their Horned Shield already?
[7:36:56] <$OfficerMods> @reasonance that makes sense int weapons scale with int or arc
[7:36:56] <ElSuperNova> I think It only gets standard ups
[7:37:00] <SIydoc> has he been down the tower?
[7:37:00] <%luftraumm1> matches enough
[7:37:03] <%cade_calrayn> @PatStaresAt huh, apparently those minotaur people, those horns are a headpiece and not their actual horns

[7:43:32] <oda_flobunaga> @NewWillinium there's a well in one of the side areas as well, there are aqueducts/sewers.  The Dung Eater points you in the direction.  there are like three interlinked dungeons down there.
[7:43:33] <Zourath> Both the small and tall versions drop their horns, and they're faith weapons.
[7:43:37] <%dOjOTron> what WAS that wadded q-tip end?
[7:43:41] <+wizard_of_diamonds> There is SO FUCKING MUCH to this game

[7:45:10] <%livi242> dark Souls 4-8

[7:45:31] <Idon__> They don't call it a city for nothing
[7:45:33] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt I said this place would consume you.   This place will take you at least 8 hours to clear.
[7:45:42] <%X2Eliah> woolie is gonna freak if he EVER gets here
[7:45:42] <+akita_opal> this is seriously 3 souls games
[7:45:43] <%cade_calrayn> There's also a sewer and a sewer's sewer, too
[7:45:44] <RyuuAoi> It's okay, Pat. You can run through it about five six times. We are here for you!

[7:46:10] <TheSandmanIsHere> there's so much under the city
[7:46:17] <%JoshManVGH> YEP
[7:46:18] <Sunstalker> I'll save you a bit pat, that part by the sand you looked at is not capable of progression until you've done the other end of the city so ignore it for now but mark it for future
[7:46:20] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> looks like Arcane
[7:46:20] <Idon__> rooftops and alleys and buildings, have fuuuuuun
[7:46:21] <Jogsy29__> but to be fair i think Witcher 3  including DLCS have the biggest  map yet EVER in gaming
[7:46:26] <TwistParabola> YEAH
[7:46:27] <ElSuperNova> Yeah its all real
[7:46:28] <%Niney_Who> You mean Oh God this isn't a Noneuclidian video game city this is a REAL city

[7:47:20] <+burntwing> missed items. EVERYWHERE
[7:47:21] <%JoshManVGH> I'm guessing ash cause the dead dragon
[7:47:21] <+akita_opal> This Area must make pats brain goblins literally burst into suns, die, then become blackholes
[7:47:25] <%cade_calrayn> It will literally take you about 7-8 attempts to comb this city
[7:47:25] <%boggsz12> lmao
[7:47:27] <+ReallyBigRocks> do these houses have addresses?
[7:47:29] <akaSiggy> There was a body hanging off the roof you jumped down with an item on it
[7:47:30] <senfood> Don't do this to him, chat. Not in this zone.
[7:47:30] <%boggsz12> good one
[7:47:31] <%luftraumm1> last rooftop on the left
[7:47:31] <%livi242> I wouldn't say that to him yet lol
[7:47:36] <pi_in_the_sci> on the roof you jumped off of
[7:47:40] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> I love how the door are literally sealed
[7:47:41] <oda_flobunaga> Man, I do not have anxiety but Layndell triggers something
[7:47:47] <$OfficerMods> So yeah we just straight up put Constantinople into a video game - Hidetaka Miyazaki
[7:47:51] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> I THOUGHT THAT WAS BUS LUL
[7:47:55] <%cade_calrayn> Y'all it'll take him multiple attempts, don't freak him out
[7:47:55] <TheSandmanIsHere> lack of Torrent is annoying
[7:47:57] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> NO YOURE NOT
[7:47:58] <%Solarint> this city alone looks as big as most games
[7:48:02] <senfood> SAD KNIGHT
[7:48:06] <Wakerz140> Gonna be honest, there's stuff alllll up and down this zone
[7:48:09] <Therusher> This is gonna be one of those zones where you do your best then look up item locations on the wiki

[7:48:13] <%Niney_Who> Not wax. Sap.
[7:48:17] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> DOOR GOO

[7:48:43] <+RushUnplugged> just think of it as syrup
[7:48:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> I bet erdtree syrup is good
[7:48:48] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> Here's Bloodborne 2
[7:48:51] <Idon__> Bro even the receptionist hopped out to attack LUL
[7:48:54] <$OfficerMods> has a nice bar though

[7:49:02] <%cade_calrayn> The Shattering happened like hundreds of years ago, so yeah, the Capital has been dead for a while
[7:49:03] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Oh boy. Perfumers

[7:50:38] <oda_flobunaga> It took me two days to fully clear this whole place, top to bottom.

[7:51:27] <Jogsy29__> @TheSandmanIsHere i forgot how fucked up Minas tirith is lmao specially when its run by a crazy stewart
[7:51:29] <+Faultlined> The fact there is a whole sewer underneath is wild

[7:54:16] <Jogsy29__> @Sunstalker oh shittt iron flesh is tied to perfume magic?? dayumm
[7:54:27] <%NBUsagi> Pat dunkin on peasants
[7:54:50] <Sunstalker> @Jogsy29__ Faith has a special version of it too without the slow down but not as strong.
[7:54:54] <%X2Eliah> yeee we Burgeuois now
[7:55:00] <Savarro> This place is absurdly big I spent most of my day here and didn't finish clearing it
[7:55:02] <+Grayhammatter> is that a giant dragon outside?
[7:55:06] <Idon__> children? Gonna bet they're dead or worse.
[7:55:07] <17sevens> this area is way too big
[7:55:08] <+678saintglock> this is my favorite area in the game but it ground my ass into dust when i came here early looking for such and such’s armor
[7:55:09] <TheSandmanIsHere> the ash is probably from most of the former inhabitants of the city
[7:55:13] <Sunstalker> @Jogsy29__ And its not even magic, its part of crafting
[7:55:17] <%Nekros4442> fucking shiteater

[7:56:21] <r0flwaffles> this place was so stressful the first time
[7:56:28] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Why is it always dog?
[7:56:35] <Sunstalker> @X2Eliah OH GOD NO. Like, he's just a fucked up asshole
[7:56:38] <+RushUnplugged> @X2Eliah what if Solaire went even more crazy and decided to shit the universe
[7:56:39] <+Akizea> @d00hicky2 absolutely not lol
[7:56:41] <+678saintglock> @x2eliah if solaire was a complete unrepentant vile disgusting monster
[7:56:43] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> just wair
[7:56:44] <haisho> I wish those dooters wouldn't aggro just so you can leave the spinny ones in peace
[7:56:47] <+ReallyBigRocks> he eats shit and is gross
[7:56:50] <$Jaxnos> i think it's mostly due to the flute
[7:56:53] <%boggsz12> i think its the music
[7:57:00] <%luftraumm1> music is great too
[7:57:06] <Jogsy29__> @Nekros4442 GTFO?! HALFWAY?!! i thought  getting on this place is pre endgame holyshit!!
[7:57:10] <domukujira> the poop maestro
[7:57:10] <reasonance> there's a reason he's called loathesome
[7:57:13] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> Strong foe ahead
[7:57:15] <$OfficerMods> @Sunstalker i'd put it a bit higher than 2 considering how pat is playing. There's alot more up north
[7:57:25] <%Willowight> the muted ambiant sounds help too
[7:57:26] <SaintBeau> lol have fun
[7:57:27] <+d00hicky2> No pat for me :( spoilers and all that
[7:57:28] <+burntwing> invasions in this place rock thats for sure
[7:57:29] <%X2Eliah> naw this place has to be close to endgame
[7:57:34] <%Nekros4442> @jogsy29__ in terms of crit path hes half way
[7:57:38] <oda_flobunaga> Yeah, after the Capital, there is SOO much left to do

[7:58:46] <+burntwing> @SaintBeau hes way over leveled at like 150+
[7:58:47] <reasonance> I wonder if the magic shield buff spell is stupid good again this time as well, that thing was always super underrated
[7:58:55] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> no you didnt
[7:58:56] <+KingKrampus> the fuck, why is Pat in Final Fantasy 12 Rababaster???
[7:59:07] <%X2Eliah> time to start using rainbow stones to mark where youve been?

[7:59:44] <TheSandmanIsHere> this was the normal people area
[7:59:44] <TwistParabola> Yes.
[7:59:44] <Sunstalker> Pat, consider marking the map with where you find elevators to help you remember them

[8:03:58] <%Solarint> totally understand, this is a bit overwhelming
[8:04:01] <+RushUnplugged> this place is 3 mazes on top of each other, it's really tough to map
[8:04:03] <$Jaxnos> we get it, Pat. the map won't make much sense for a while.
[8:04:09] <%gag5y> misbegotten lionel!? what is this a crossover!?
[8:04:11] <+edgeroth> this area is pretty crazy

[8:04:18] <Sunstalker> Dude, the sun went down while I was exploring this place and my brain just gave up trying to map it.

[8:04:19] <+akita_opal> This guy is back nice
[8:04:20] <%livi242> inch by inch
[8:04:24] <%Solarint> wow that dog was just chillin D:
[8:04:25] <%luftraumm1> @patstaresat don't feel bad about quiet, takes brain power to understand the area
[8:04:25] <$Jaxnos> ok, i'm getting barricade shield.
[8:04:25] <%ithonmage> NOOOOOOOOO
[8:04:29] <Jogsy29__> leonines become common enemies now
[8:04:30] <%tsuchi7> the Capital is huge
[8:04:31] <Jogsy29__> yikes
[8:04:32] <%TheLemuroid> Oh thank god a wall
[8:04:36] <TheSandmanIsHere> that dog was harmless
[8:04:43] <XxMoliciousxX> he say you stink
[8:04:48] <%gag5y> i hear you can fit 16 anor londos in the city alone
[8:04:49] <+678saintglock> i was surprised by how many bosses become regular enemies later
[8:04:51] <TheSandmanIsHere> it was just sitting there and you killed it
[8:04:56] <%Nekros4442> @thesandmanishere its fromsoft. Dogs are never harmless
[8:04:58] <TheSandmanIsHere> you monster
[8:04:58] <+TrevSmith222> The dog is literally harmless.  lol
[8:05:10] <TheSandmanIsHere> no that specific dog was
[8:05:14] <%X2Eliah> dogs are the LEAST harmless
[8:05:23] <TheSandmanIsHere> it just sits there and watches you
[8:05:24] <%gag5y> that dog was asking for it
[8:05:34] <TheSandmanIsHere> unless you attack it
[8:05:39] <ClarentMordred> @X2Eliah that dog specifically wont aggro to you
[8:05:44] <%ithonmage> They made the one dog in the game just sit and chill
[8:05:44] <+678saintglock> “it was comin right for me”
[8:05:46] <%livi242> man shields are great in this game but I love powerstancing
[8:05:56] <+TrevSmith222> Yeah, the dog actually doesn't aggro.  It's weird.
[8:06:08] <TheSandmanIsHere> does Pat murder all the tortoises too?
[8:06:18] <+RidGaming> which seal are you using?
[8:06:27] <TwistParabola> they WHAT
[8:06:37] <sparkavery> aren't you supposed to murder everything
[8:06:56] <%Fenrisulfr_V> The music in this game is so fucking good.
[8:06:57] <ohno58> lore reasons
[8:06:58] <+ReallyBigRocks> gotta help the mutants smell nice
[8:07:05] <%Pookiedaexzile> Demi Humans
[8:07:07] <+silent__chief> demi-human slaves probably
[8:07:11] <TwistParabola> the Perfumers have sympathy for the Misbegotten
[8:07:12] <+TheMuuj> this city is a melting pot

[8:07:50] <TheBlankAce> Pat on his goal to recreate class warfare
[8:07:57] <%Willowight> theyre unionizing
[8:07:58] <%cade_calrayn> those are Misbegotten, they're cursed humans born to normal humans
[8:07:59] <%NBUsagi> and now there is a whole ass castle too

[8:08:37] <+KingKrampus> @pookiedaexzile Pat's resentment against all things faith is very French of him
[8:08:37] <kinkade_77> what sword is pat using
[8:08:40] <+wizard_of_diamonds> The Perfumer's whistling reminds me of the Nobles in Sekiro
[8:08:42] <Sunstalker> @bevyrage close but no
[8:08:43] <%cade_calrayn> opposite side of the city
[8:08:44] <%X2Eliah> look at this endgame gate

[8:09:29] <oda_flobunaga> @TheLemuroid there is, past that barrier
[8:09:33] <%SveriSageAdvice> thats such bullshit, the grace is literally right on the other side of that
[8:09:35] <%X2Eliah> ok so that is the way OUT

[8:11:48] <$Jaxnos> oh god damn it, i don't know what i did, but i can't get this fool to give me this dialogue.

[8:12:35] <+Enz0ned> carf
[8:12:38] <Wakerz140> You can give it to him earlier
[8:12:48] <+KingKrampus> @tanarath I didn't say she wasn't, just not a maiden; like imagine her being the new "Virgin" Mary
[8:12:52] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> ALL HE DOES IS REMOVE CAPES
[8:12:56] <$Jaxnos> @Jaxnos as he started the dialogue and said that, i realized i have rennala's stuff boxed, so i guess that doesn't count as in my inventory
[8:12:58] <+Enz0ned> careful here pat.
[8:12:59] <haisho> such a nice boy
[8:13:01] <Abd0022> the golden semen?

[8:13:49] <Sunstalker> Use the 'Youre Breautiful" voice item on him for extra dialogue, Pat
[8:13:53] <Therusher> I messed up the questline here :(
[8:13:54] <GrenYena> Lord Patrick CoolCat
[8:13:54] <WorstThingsFirst> What a Stan.

[8:14:56] <RyuuAoi> Kill him, Pat! What he got in that sack?
[8:14:57] <Sunstalker> Do not give him the tear, it's uh, sad
[8:15:01] <+RushUnplugged> oh god why does he sound so much like Clemps
[8:15:01] <TwistParabola> @PatStaresAt keep in mind that Rennala's Great Rune says that it perfects the rebirth process, and that only you have it
[8:15:07] <+KingKrampus> PAT IF YOU KILL HIM
[8:15:11] <%luftraumm1> if he is reborn I bet he'll die
[8:15:13] <%greasypete00> yeyeye

[8:15:42] <Khester824> i punched him and he asked be was it because he was ugly
[8:15:44] <Xelhesia> wow
[8:15:46] <Sigma_190_Beta> SHE MADE THOSE?
[8:15:48] <Sunstalker> It's cuz he wants to be reborn due to how ugly he feels himself to be
[8:15:49] <$Jaxnos> you're his mother now, Pat.
[8:15:50] <+NeonFishFace> You're perfect, little monkey man
[8:15:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> demi-humans are cool

[8:16:18] <Therusher> I'm bummed I missed the "I'm beautiful" stone and he peaced out of my game
[8:16:19] <XxMoliciousxX> he's going to be eaten alive isn't he
[8:16:19] <TwistParabola> yayyyy
[8:16:19] <+ReallyBigRocks> we should teach more monke men how to use magic
[8:16:19] <%cade_calrayn> Boc is friend-shaped
[8:16:24] <ALazo> Boc will now DIE FOR YOU
[8:16:24] <%luftraumm1> do it for him
[8:16:30] <%Aeoneth> FUCK I didn't have that prattling pate when I got to here
[8:16:30] <floydisco> I gave him the larval tear without knowing, because I'm a shallow, shallow fool.
[8:16:33] <+RushUnplugged> "Fromsoft games are grim and sad" HERE'S A LOVABLE MONKEY MAN TO PROTECT AT ALL COSTS
[8:16:34] <+678saintglock> this is one of those moments i wish i had a chat to tell me stuff during my playthrough
[8:16:35] <%JoshManVGH> Would he die if he was given the Larval Tear?
[8:16:39] <Sunstalker> Can you believe this shit, Pat? Emote/voice unlocked dialogue in SOULS
[8:16:42] <%Aeoneth> Bad things
[8:16:43] <DonCapiche> he dies
[8:16:43] <$Jaxnos> he goes to get reborn
[8:16:44] <+twenty112> He probably dies
[8:16:47] <TheSandmanIsHere> @joshmanvgh yes
[8:16:48] <%tetraes> he dies lol
[8:16:48] <Wakerz140> He goes and does it and bad things happen
[8:16:48] <TheBlankAce> Read the flavor text of the tear
[8:16:49] <flap_junior> He dies
[8:16:49] <+678saintglock> he fucking dies
[8:16:50] <%Nobrev> he becomes human but dies after @PatStaresAt
[8:16:50] <%tsuchi7> he cant be reborn properly
[8:16:50] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> HE FUCKING DIES
[8:16:53] <TwistParabola> he gets to be reborn
[8:16:55] <%Fenrisulfr_V> He dies. Bad end,
[8:16:55] <+Enz0ned> he dies
[8:16:55] <NewWillinium> He goes to be reincarnated. And it does not go well. . .at all
[8:16:56] <+Kensun7> he dies
[8:16:58] <hellboyryan69> You can see him reborn in rennala's room
[8:16:58] <floydisco> He goes to Raya Lucaria and dies in his new body
[8:16:59] <Sunstalker> Reborn with no memories
[8:17:05] <+thickshield> without the rune of the unborn rebirth always makes a broken person
[8:17:05] <%livi242> he doesn't have the great rune like you do
[8:17:07] <Therusher> He goes to get reborn, becomes human, and then dies when you rest at a bonfire (read larval tear desc)
[8:17:09] <TwistParabola> he gets reborn but not properly
[8:17:11] <Zebroneath> He turns human, can't speak, and then dies when you reload at the Academy
[8:17:15] <%Nekros4442> read flavour text of tear?
[8:17:26] <HeroToxiko> he fucks
[8:17:29] <%tsuchi7> has pat done the Dung Eater questline yet?
[8:17:30] <Sigma_190_Beta> There was a door.
[8:17:32] <+ReallyBigRocks> The lore around rebirth seems like it sucks ass unless you're a big protagonist
[8:17:35] <Sigma_190_Beta> Right?
[8:17:36] <$Jaxnos> they wish to chew
[8:17:43] <%luftraumm1> woa damage
[8:17:44] <TheSandmanIsHere> Redeads?Redheads?!
[8:17:45] <Sigma_190_Beta> Oh, it's in Sap.
[8:17:46] <Sunstalker> @tsuchi7 Nope, he won't be able to for a while yet
[8:17:50] <Sigma_190_Beta> Sorry.
[8:17:50] <+AyupaPupa> real fake door
[8:17:52] <TheSandmanIsHere> what the hell autocorrupt
[8:17:57] <%cade_calrayn> One guy
[8:18:03] <reasonance> "Children born anew by Rennala are all frail and short-lived. Imperfect beings, each and all."
[8:18:03] <+RushUnplugged> the fact that these guys are technically not undead fucks me up
[8:18:04] <TheSandmanIsHere> just Redeads, no redheads
[8:18:06] <rosemon5001> these are ex doors Kappa
[8:18:06] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt if they have sap on them, they don't open
[8:18:07] <oda_flobunaga> @PatStaresAt okay, no look for a way down around here
[8:18:11] <%JoshManVGH> Pat did you ever read the Larval Tear text?
[8:18:14] <DonCapiche> finger but hole
[8:18:25] <TheSandmanIsHere> behold, door!
[8:18:25] <+untitled2536> looks like Bloodborne
[8:18:27] <oda_flobunaga> Sewers! yay
[8:18:36] <%luftraumm1> you did
[8:18:36] <+ReallyBigRocks> This is like Anor Londo x Yharnam
[8:18:39] <Sunstalker> GRABBED LuL
[8:18:39] <Therusher> It's the hint for boc
[8:18:41] <%tsuchi7> last line
[8:18:49] <Sunstalker> No, there's just a lot.
[8:18:51] <reasonance> great rune of the unborn has the lore
[8:18:59] <%JoshManVGH> "heart of a mimic" and "births people a new"
[8:19:06] <%moondog_> this place looks an awful lot like Hyrule in OoT when you go forward in time
[8:19:18] <KobeTeeth90> is there a Guts from Berserk build yet??
[8:19:23] <+edgeroth> faith is so cool
[8:19:36] <%Nobrev> my int rocks get 3 rocks at a time but they fire slower
[8:19:41] <+nayre> But wait, there's more
[8:19:44] <%TheLemuroid> it's an actual city
[8:19:47] <ohno58> Faith bros eatin good in this game.
[8:19:48] <+KingKrampus> @moondog_ imagine Ganondorf showing up in this place

[8:19:57] <$OfficerMods> @KobeTeeth90 they gave you the arm
[8:19:57] <reasonance> @KobeTeeth90 I mean, there's the big sword, wolf armor, and even a hand-ballista
[8:20:08] <%Nekros4442> @patstaresat apparently the great rune of the unborn has the lore tidbit not the silver tear
[8:20:14] <+twenty112> I kicked a ladder in this zone and then I never found the ladder again
[8:20:14] <%moondog_> @kingkrampus and he's in his pig form so you can fist him

[8:22:11] <%gag5y> erm me at middle school *smugs grinly*
[8:22:19] <%luftraumm1> these guys should NOT be here, unless....
[8:22:23] <$Jaxnos> LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
[8:22:23] <%pabloelenano2> mother fucker feels like a nemesis from shadow of mordor
[8:22:24] <tanarath> FREE
[8:22:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> oh my god

[8:22:28] <KobeTeeth90> LUL

[8:22:39] <+Romuken> he baby
[8:22:40] <%gag5y> DARKLURKER NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[8:22:45] <KobeTeeth90> thats a win
[8:22:47] <+RedMaskBandit> pet it
[8:22:48] <%JoshManVGH> The implication seems to be that Renalla turns tears you down and injects you into Mimic Goo, to shape a quantum state of you. And the Rune keeps your mind in tact. So Bok would probably end up like the failed mimics you fought.
[8:22:49] <%Willowight> gave up
[8:22:49] <Sunstalker> He was almost dead already anyway
[8:22:51] <Khester824> that happened to me 30 mins ago
[8:22:54] <%Agami23> grace nearby
[8:22:55] <$Jaxnos> the fact that the glitch is repeatable in an entirely different place is beautiful
[8:22:55] <SaintBeau> LUL LUL LUL
[8:22:58] <%plumiie_> LMAO
[8:23:01] <SaintBeau> thats amazing
[8:23:02] <DusK_The_Stray> We take those every time
[8:23:05] <Zebroneath> a win is a win is a win
[8:23:06] <%gag5y> @JoshManVGH thats kinda hot
[8:23:17] <%Fenrisulfr_V> @PatStaresAt That's how I killed the one at the bottom of the tutorial.
[8:23:17] <SaintBeau> we take those
[8:23:22] <KobeTeeth90> @JoshManVGH LUL
[8:23:28] <%justcallmebobplease> Literally every Eldtree Root monster has broken on me - it might have something to do with how I distract them with summons while blasting them with the Sword of Night and Flame - but for real 4/4 met so far broke on me.
[8:23:38] <TheSandmanIsHere> and still no grace
[8:23:41] <%TurtlesAndTentacles> @joshmanvgh That's some hard lore
[8:23:42] <Midnight188> where tf is the next grace here jfc
[8:23:50] <%SveriSageAdvice> and except for down below
[8:23:57] <Wakerz140> There's ways back up
[8:23:58] <@Spydurman> there's always more
[8:23:59] <oda_flobunaga> SEWER SEWER SEWER
[8:23:59] <@PrefectusCorgi> Alweays the roofsd
[8:24:02] <GrenYena> Lyndell is fucking huge. I hated this place. Actual mental overload
[8:24:09] <+izanagi22> This is a very long time without grace
[8:24:12] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> GRACE UP LEFT
[8:24:16] <Sunstalker> I see hands
[8:24:17] <Midnight188> [civvie sewer count dings up by 1]
[8:24:30] <%Nobrev> visions of fingers
[8:24:31] <TheSandmanIsHere> welcome to poopville, top floor
[8:24:32] <Sunstalker> @izanagi22 he's wandered around and gotten close
[8:24:38] <+twenty112> It takes forever to find a grace and then you find like 5 right beside eachother
[8:24:42] <%TheLemuroid> seems your goal of finding a grace might take longer than planned
[8:24:55] <$Jaxnos> the whole gang's here. rats and hands.
[8:25:10] <haisho> hands and rats
[8:25:13] <tri3dgE027> everyone in the party cave

[8:26:51] <+Fracture93> @patstaresat in inventory if you press stick in you can sort by acquire time to find new items easier
[8:26:52] <%luftraumm1> orb armor
[8:26:54] <TheSandmanIsHere> you had him help with Radahn
[8:26:56] <%JonathLP> Pat got his armor!~
[8:26:59] <reasonance> that was one of the Fia's Champion bosses
[8:27:00] <digaogrunge> Fia summoned him

[8:27:05] <Xelhesia> she crushed his dick so hard he died

[8:27:11] <tri3dgE027> Oh, Fia knows him
[8:27:16] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> BECOME CHONK
[8:27:16] <%tsuchi7> amazin
[8:27:17] <%Agami23> yes. "father"
[8:27:18] <%TheLemuroid> wait there's a sort?
[8:27:18] <+Grayhammatter> orb armor
[8:27:21] <+akita_opal> Mpreg armor
[8:27:21] <TheSandmanIsHere> so she called him daddy when they fucked
[8:27:23] <Sigma_190_Beta> It's your armor Pat.
[8:27:24] <%cade_calrayn> ORB
[8:27:30] <+burntwing> DS2 turtle armor
[8:27:34] <%cade_calrayn> show Paige the orb
[8:27:38] <digaogrunge> TRUE ORB
[8:27:41] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> TOUCH GRACE
[8:27:42] <+twenty112> What if orb AND big hat?
[8:27:42] <Sunstalker> @Nobrev Go on the big open road and then explore a way to get on top the wall next to it
[8:27:47] <Zourath> Wait, can you deathbed dress + Mimic, to regen each-other?
[8:27:51] <%cade_calrayn> .... maybe
[8:27:55] <TwistParabola> it basically is
[8:27:55] <haisho> bonfire?
[8:28:06] <Sigma_190_Beta> @Call_Me_Deacon_Blues Dude, don't be typing in all caps.
[8:28:06] <@PrefectusCorgi> Grace Hole you mean
[8:28:17] <%Niney_Who> Elden Ring proves that ROCKS are the best anything
[8:28:19] <%Agami23> the stone is boosted by the beast seal if thats what you're using
[8:28:19] <%Call_Me_Deacon_Blues> button was stuck
[8:28:20] <+AyupaPupa> throw rock
[8:28:21] <%tsuchi7> the beast seal feels OP
[8:28:22] <%JustTheGuyYouNeed> Its weaker but faster
[8:28:22] <$Jaxnos> i wonder if there's a way to meet Lionel in a non-summon or dead form. i don't need the answer, just thinking aloud.
[8:28:22] <TheSandmanIsHere> @prefectuscorgi grass hole
[8:28:27] <%Niney_Who> The Triple Meteorite Sorcery is also Overpowered
[8:28:28] <TheBlankAce> Throwing rocks is just the Earth's lightning bolt
[8:28:33] <Sunstalker> Those sewers aren't THE sewers. You're uh, not capable of going to the big sewer yet
[8:28:33] <sirrice77> the only issue with stone is it can actually go over enemies heads and miss
[8:28:38] <Therusher> stone is real good for that stagger
[8:28:38] <%JoshManVGH> You had to do some fucking work for that rock so it makes sense
[8:28:39] <senfood> I love you but I'm not IN love with you.
[8:28:42] <%Agami23> and rocks do physical rather than electric
[8:28:42] <reasonance> you tried the dragonbolt buff you got earlier? it's surprisingly good
[8:29:03] <$Jaxnos> i can't believe Pat just killed Lightning Bolt
[8:29:08] <Sunstalker> It makes enemies bounce off you
[8:29:13] <+hakumaribo> @PatStaresAt friendship ended with lightning Bolt, ROCK is now best friend.
[8:29:14] <%TheLemuroid> Who would win? Signature miracle or throwing rocks
[8:29:17] <Grave_Titan_D> i think we should see other people lightning bolt
[8:29:19] <+RushUnplugged> sometimes you need a physical damage alternative to elemental spells, and I'm glad there's an option on both sorcery and incant
[8:29:23] <Sunstalker> Like 0.5 Iron lesh
[8:30:02] <reasonance> makes attacks kinda bounce off you
[8:30:09] <%DEETRz> your mimic might use it tho and then slap even harder
[8:30:24] <%luftraumm1> you're also not using any fire miracles
[8:30:31] <+twenty112> cool
[8:30:42] <%Willowight> sure junks up the screen
[8:31:03] <SaintBeau> capra motherfucker
[8:31:05] <tanarath> broken
[8:31:05] <Sunstalker> This guy is too big for that. His moves are collosal.
[8:31:08] <%JoshManVGH> Fucking gwyn as shit up in here
[8:31:10] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt easier to deflect =/= auto-deflect
[8:31:15] <Sunstalker> Go run into the other knights
[8:31:19] <%zarkazeon> pat did you know you can hold up on dpad to go back to ur first spell. just like down for estus.
[8:31:26] <Sunstalker> and don't even shield
[8:31:44] <%Pookiedaexzile> Gwyns Wild Teenage years
[8:31:55] <%Dakuu75> still dunno if the erdtree is a good thing or a bad thing
