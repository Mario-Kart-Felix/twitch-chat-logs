[0:38:42] <%SuperSonichu> controversial gamer opinion: Horror games about zombies/the undead are overdone and horror about aliens is much more fun
[0:38:43] <HealingMind> Really, doomslayer should go around in a chainmail bikini

[0:38:57] <%Fien111> The best mech in any mech show/game is the CHUNKIEST. THat's why Battletech is fucking AWESOME. THe mechs look like shit and therefor awesome
[0:38:58] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Doomslayer is fine in his birthday suit, the armor is just his prefered look
[0:38:58] <1matheuw> i mean he defeated the titan BEFORE getting the armor

[1:12:54] <xeros720> it keeps the frame rate decent though, so i can't hate it too much
[1:12:55] <Graxe_> It's to maintain the aspect ratio for both players
[1:12:55] <%Grayhammatter> that's so slow
[1:12:59] <%SuperDeagle> “We were Partners.”
[1:13:01] <suikudo> Go right

[2:37:54] <%xemnahort> @devanmuse these are made utilizing every virus from before including las plagas but ouroboros is the perfected super world end version while the basic one is the marketable insta bio weapon version
[2:37:55] <%spiritofmojave> hope Pat's not clogging his colon AND bladder now
