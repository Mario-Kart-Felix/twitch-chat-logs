[0:12:53] <%ssjklyco> When was the last game to come out on stadia?
[0:12:57] <%crimsonharvest> yeah google doesn't produce anything original so there's NO ROOM to hold forth on licensing other poeples content
[0:13:08] <Belakitu> Gief gettin so chonky
[0:13:12] <+Promessa_EX> But steam has the legs that when you buy a game you trust you will have access for many a year
[0:13:14] <%Piemen99> oh word

[0:13:15] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:13:18] <Make_me_mad> That guy is a hilariously high concentration of terrible opinions and he's sadly in a position to force other people to go along with them.
[0:13:20] <jorniev> BALDURS GATE 3?
[0:13:24] <Vaun0x> Luna tho
[0:13:27] <%DedlokPM> @depressed_skeleton yes, but he doesn't work for those other ones, so the irony isn't so strong pointing it out for them

[0:15:07] <Winner_92> really what this guy's tweet exposes is how archaic copyright law is with streaming because it's written by boomers
[0:15:07] <+walternatorz> all due to among us
[0:15:08] <%Sotetsu> I've bought so many games due to streamers. Hundreds of dollars.

[0:15:13] <@commanderclaw> Politicians becoming streamers is a weird world
[0:15:15] <narusao> too much free publicity
[0:15:16] <+The_RDDM> AOC gotta pay the stream tax too LUL
[0:15:17] <%Roundelay11> He's just another dumbfuck who can't adapt to changing media
[0:15:19] <%SaiyanShoto> A guy wrecked him when he said he was going to start streaming fall guys LUL LUL LUL
[0:15:19] <scrublord009> Among Us Dev: THE GOVERMENT IS STEALING FROM US

[0:15:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also people making Boomer jokes, you know AOC is 31, right? She's younger than Pat.
[0:15:40] <%DappercatEsquire> BUT PAT, MORE MONEY PLS
[0:15:40] <%Starotter70> Hmmmmm

[0:15:58] <segychan> So many LAVA HOT TAKES today
[0:15:59] <%ShineTheDiamond> Mild shock
[0:16:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Nintendo?
[0:16:02] <+The_RDDM> Reminder: He's nothing to do with the console side of things. He's a creative director at one of their dev studios.
[0:16:03] <coracor> ATLUS
[0:16:07] <%TheWinged7> you mean ATLAS?
[0:16:07] <%Sotetsu> Atlas still does.
[0:16:08] <%tizz86> so he's the Trump of the video game biome
[0:16:08] <+ju_ten> ATLUS
[0:16:11] <%crimsonharvest> having been part of the structure of a Ubi project makes him very suspicious
[0:16:11] <%Roundelay11> I remember the Nintendo shit
[0:16:12] <reonome> he isn't even an og stadia dev his studio just got bought by google
[0:16:13] <winniethecoof> I demand to hear the status of Zangief grumbles!!!
[0:16:15] <Winner_92> fucking ATLUS man christ
[0:16:21] <+DynDimAcsiwn> apparently he has fuck all to do with stadia and is just a creative director at a studio owned by google
[0:16:27] <scrublord009> THE CONTENT THIEVES LUL
[0:16:33] <Vaun0x> man who sells service where you dont own stuff gets mad at you for using things you dont own LUL
[0:16:34] <%DrProfW> It makes sense for ATLUS because they hate making money
[0:16:34] <%Typhaeon> Wait what
[0:16:43] <%TheWinged7> oops sales go down
[0:16:46] <SlingPlaysGames> jasons tweet: The funniest thing about today's streaming drama is that everyone thinks Alex Hutchinson runs Google Stadia (because his Twitter bio says "Creative Director @ Google Stadia"). He's actually a creative director at a Montreal game studio that was purchased by Google last December
[0:16:46] <+Cacti_Israphe> entertainment corps trying to gaslight consumers over whether or not they actually purchased a product
[0:16:48] <%Starotter70> No, come back!
[0:16:50] <Belakitu> Guess they just don’t want anyone talking about their games
[0:16:52] <+xmetalicdemonx> and at that time I stopped caring about nintendo.
[0:16:54] <%Typhaeon> Double dipping, good job dipshits
[0:16:54] <%Roundelay11> Bunch of boardroon dinosaurs
[0:16:54] <wibbwobbler> exactly, just become irrelevant then lol
[0:16:55] <%Tman451> You didnt want to be a Nintendy PARTNER??
[0:16:57] <Prevot> fucking atlus
[0:16:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Just give us MOST of the money.
[0:16:59] <+ju_ten> sega needs to like forcibly escort all of the top brass at atlus out of their building
[0:17:00] <M0untain_wolf> Privileged Influencers!
[0:17:02] <%Sotetsu> Ugh, I remember that. What a shit show.
[0:17:03] <%butthurtdave> Hey Pat, how about that Fire Emblem?
[0:17:04] <winniethecoof> does the Zangief grumble? i must know
[0:17:07] <bigbrothergannon> yea they were idiots
[0:17:15] <scrublord009> People with money be wildin
[0:17:21] <%ssjklyco> you technically cant play a movie in your home to a large group of people and would have to pay the movie industry to do so.
[0:17:22] <%pepzi_boyz> the dog now looks like an overused pillow
[0:17:24] <Winner_92> the entire atlus board of directors needs to be publicly executed via firing squad
[0:17:35] <coracor> given up (for now)
[0:17:36] <LoopiDarko> Alex Navarro slaughtered that dude
[0:17:37] <M0untain_wolf> lol
[0:17:37] <%Das_Bass> ATLUS
[0:17:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Yeah I know we make money, but what if we could make ALL OF THE MONEY."
[0:17:44] <stevenellis386> then they realized we could use these youtubers as free marketers.

[0:17:49] <%DappercatEsquire> it's only a matter of time before all this shit gets real dumb again
[0:17:50] <scrublord009> ATLUS WASSUP LUL
[0:17:58] <%primarch_lupercal> alex navarro worked on rockband before giant bomb so if anyone knows about the bs of licensing its him
[0:18:02] <@commanderclaw> Don't rock the money boat
[0:18:09] <Chatterbox1991> @patstaresat anyone remember the SOPA and PIPA bills in the US a couple years ago?
[0:18:09] <%walternatorz> but what about more money??
[0:18:10] <BliVru> it's more like a Cold war using proxies
[0:18:11] <%Roundelay11> Part of the problem is that DMCA is such an ancient piece of legislation that couldn't keep up with the changes to media
[0:18:13] <%ShineTheDiamond> It's almost like streaming is free advertisement for games...
[0:18:13] <%notgarza> What have you done? psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:18:22] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> symbiotic business relationship >> copyright law

[0:24:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Winner_92 I'm sure the author of that bad take is MORE THAN HAPPY to have Alex take the blame for it to.
[0:24:56] <brambobelurkin> turn that poop into wine
[0:25:08] <%TheWinged7> @Aeoneth I know, but just continuing the fun poking
[0:25:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> @rekinom "All Japanese stories are gibberish" - Actual Quote from Alex Hutchinson.
[0:25:23] <%lumporr> is this the stadia lead guy everybody's shitting on
[0:25:32] <winniethecoof> who's alex hutchinson
[0:25:34] <%TheWinged7> @Aeoneth and was also thinking more of every time their game is started up on the system, shoulda worded it better
[0:25:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> Creative director, yeaup.
[0:25:38] <Winner_92> man twitter's main character today SUCKED

[0:25:42] <%lumporr> because i can't believe that i can't believe how dumb he is
[0:25:46] <%SlingPlaysGames> the balls to dump on other people's story telling after you worked on AC3 certainly is something
[0:25:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> @winniethecoof Just google his name and all your answers will be questioned.... You know what I mean

[0:26:05] <%TheWinged7> @winniethecoof some racist, sexist moron whos company was bought by google

[0:34:56] <%JamesCorck> Epstein can't say anything tho.
[0:34:57] <+StooEsq> Alex wanted to stream Fall Guys because he got tired of being a Fall Guy in real life
[0:34:58] <+Clundy> Donald Trumperton wouldnt agree
[0:34:58] <%bevyrage> for an individual there is always a problem with bad publicity. when it comes to a business fading into obscurity is worse than having a stigma associated with you, because AT LEAST the stigma keeps your business in peeps' minds
[0:34:59] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @Make_me_mad and all the proceedes from those book sales went to Nichole Browns family via court order
[0:34:59] <%Ranryu692> non-New Yorkers can never understand how gratifying it is to see the whole country come around on the "Giuliani is a piece of shit" train
[0:35:00] <%Typhaeon> Jeffrey Toobin would disagree

[0:35:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> Gawker and Kotaku should Burn
[0:35:14] <%DukeMoose> In the Hulksters case he WON the bad press case and got a shitton of money though

[0:35:17] <scrublord009> Thanks for the KPOPheart @czeekyplays
[0:35:20] <+rottingpastry> to be fair, this publicity did get me to try stadia and find out that it breaks with dual monitors and is blurry as fuck even when it works.
[0:35:21] <%Chimeraelite> Gawker was fucked
[0:35:22] <%lumporr> HOGAN HAD A SEX TAPE?
[0:35:25] <%rumtumtugnutz> I think a lot of those people who were cancelled would disagree
[0:35:28] <HotMafia81> Nothing should leave any company without back-filling money into the hole it left
[0:35:29] <watts121> Georgia!
[0:35:29] <%Typhaeon> Gawker was a really trashy rag whose demise is a net positive
[0:35:29] <%DedlokPM> @PatStaresAt What do you mean? He was just tucking in his pants while laying flat on his back. Just like every person does. doodDed
[0:35:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh how about also outing the lawyer who ended up representing Hogan in that case before he had come out of the closet?
[0:35:31] <%BinaryFireball> he's racist?
[0:35:31] <$RealThiele> @SirGO0SE First responders saved the city, he just took credit and photos
[0:35:32] <%Valdorick> Wait, but does Hulk have a brand remaining to destroy?
[0:35:33] <%BinaryFireball> ugh
[0:35:33] <%AncelDeLambert> regardless of Hogan's behavior, the tape being treated as it was was horrendous
[0:35:35] <%butthurtdave> I still don't get that shit "YEAH WHO WANTS TO SEE HULK HOGAN'S DICK?" "Bro, nobody, that's gross" "BUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH!"
[0:35:38] <%SirGO0SE> @Ranryu692 its true. he sucks but he was god tier when we needed him
[0:35:38] <%LiquidDinosaur> Hulk is a bad guy and Gawker are dirtbags. both can be true
[0:35:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @richmon_ Unless your james Gunn then you can get your job back instantly
[0:35:40] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @lumporr for the love of god don't google it

[0:35:59] <Aydarkzero> Code Good
[0:36:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> Apple SHOULD get legally fucked but Epic is also 1000% hillariously wrong in their suit
[0:36:02] <%butthurtdave> hashtag sponsored
[0:36:03] <%Piemen99> @lumporr how bad is it
[0:36:10] <wibbwobbler> THEY PAID YOU?
[0:36:10] <+cgreene64> Afaiu he didn't actually have the money to fight it, but some other multi-millionaire funded it b/c they hated Gawker
[0:36:12] <%oniwahoo> @butthurtdave Seems like the kind of thing you'd pay not to see

[0:36:33] <%LoneFonte> GOOD
[0:36:34] <Aydarkzero> they had to for that kind of case
[0:36:36] <%Piemono> Nobody likes you when you're 23
[0:36:38] <+Promessa_EX> don't do a bad
[0:36:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> Epic even WANTED THAT JUDGE
[0:36:40] <%BallerSwagBro9k> or 27
[0:36:41] <%LiquidDinosaur> GAMER JUDGE
[0:36:41] <+KingXANA> Oh hey. I'm 25 still sucks
[0:36:42] <%SirGO0SE> @RealThiele they did thats totally true. but the city responded and that district is more beautiful than ever.
[0:36:43] <Karhax> Epic's big mistake was to flaunt breaking the rules
[0:36:44] <jorniev> epic deserves it as much as apple
[0:36:44] <$RealThiele> Peter Thiel is a ghoul that funded Gawkers destruction for outing him as a gay republican tech guy

[0:36:55] <+D00msDayDan> oh man how the hell would that lawsuit go if the judge was some ignorant dinosaur
[0:36:58] <scrublord009> ALL FOR MONEY
[0:36:59] <%SirGO0SE> well it was @RealThiele LUL
[0:37:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> No we want Epic to die more than Apple
[0:37:03] <%crimsonharvest> The more they tear each other up the better
[0:37:03] <wibbwobbler> fortnite 2
[0:37:03] <%Roundelay11> Epic got too arrogant
[0:37:04] <MyNameIsRasus> And it's all Epic's fault
[0:37:04] <+rottingpastry> I mean, they broke the rules on purpose in order to force a lawsuit so...lol
[0:37:05] <%Ranryu692> @SirGO0SE He really wasn't. His photo ops interfered with first responder's efforts, and his administration's insistence that the air quality was safe has claimed almost as many lives to date as the planes did

[0:38:20] <MyNameIsRasus> That's a red flag
[0:38:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt That game was a new engine

[0:38:43] <%zeif00> Imagine working for this dude
[0:38:45] <shutupyouprick> that extra boobage requires a lot more attention I guess
[0:38:45] <+rottingpastry> what, "women are hard to put in video games"? yeah probs
[0:38:49] <HotMafia81> OH THAT SHITHEAD? Is he just a balloon being kept aloft in the sky by his own hot air?
[0:38:53] <%SirGO0SE> @Ranryu692 youre not wrong, its part of why i dont like the guy now. but to imagine doing a much better job is hard. i thought at the time that the world was ending lol
[0:38:56] <%DedlokPM> @Valdorick Are they though? Are they really? Last I heard it was just an announcement of "we are doing e-sports!" doodDerp
[0:38:58] <%DappercatEsquire> eh, it was a weird comment worth side-eyeing at least
[0:38:58] <%Valdorick> But the execs were the ones doing sexual abuse, so what use is a flag from them?

[0:43:38] <%rdark_ksu> I want a book that is just a ton of pictures of crap takes ppl thought should be put on twitter
[0:43:39] <reddpop_> video streaming service that was had episodes short enough to avoid paying writers their union wages
[0:43:40] <%코코꾸라> TV series in short form episodes, around 10 minutes each @PatStaresAt
[0:43:41] <%coreyyotto> I only know about Quibi because of Internet Today
[0:43:41] <%BinaryFireball> Oh no they still have hundred of mills left
[0:43:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> One of my friends worked on some stuff for them
[0:43:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> @NeoCre It's almost like MattPat is a hack.
[0:43:45] <+freelancer_960> netflix for phones, with programming made and everything
[0:43:45] <%BinaryFireball> so only 13 bil

[0:43:47] <black_pariah> anti union short form tv
[0:43:48] <%lumporr> they could've at least given me some
[0:43:48] <%SlingPlaysGames> Matpat made a video about which of your favorite game characters would survive covid
[0:43:48] <+ianabstract> they made short video content so they could avoid paying union rates to actors and writers
[0:43:49] <Chatterbox1991> RENO 911 WAS COMING BACK
[0:43:50] <DatAsuna> It's TV boomers trying to replace youtube
[0:43:51] <%NeoCre> 1.4 billion
[0:43:51] <%crimsonharvest> sounds like a money laundering scheme
[0:43:52] <%rumtumtugnutz> It’s an app to watch Reno 911!
[0:43:52] <Kalarchis> aaaaaand it's gone
[0:43:52] <%McCloud90> it was streaming app specifically for phones
[0:43:53] <cpeter123> money is just an idea

[0:44:02] <jorniev> what are you tallking about!?
[0:44:02] <+Promessa_EX> bootleg netflix, boomer investers love that idea
[0:44:03] <%Giggalith> Netflix but everything is 10 minutes long
[0:44:04] <+coolthulhuu> scre using that money to help people, just burn it all
[0:44:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah
[0:44:05] <@commanderclaw> Yep
[0:44:05] <Vaun0x> it got a lot of advertising on yt, it's like Netflix but everything's 10 minutes long
[0:44:06] <+rottingpastry> Yes, that is literally the premise
[0:44:06] <%NeedlesD> Pretty Much
[0:44:07] <Winner_92> don't worry tho, the quibi CEO might be part of biden's cabinet
[0:44:07] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Gotta disrupt those markets somehow
[0:44:07] <%YakumoYomi> Essentially
[0:44:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> pretty much
[0:44:09] <+The_RDDM> That's it, yeah
[0:44:09] <blackbaron98> Pretty much
[0:44:09] <+tigerfang86> LETS MAKE HIGH END 10 MINUTE CONTENT
[0:44:10] <%arancet> yes thats what they said
[0:44:11] <%cylish> They tried to make movies in 10 minute chunks
[0:44:11] <%butthurtdave> So like every modern cartoon?
[0:44:11] <+Izzzyko> I wqanted to watch the reno911 mini reboot they did but im not downloading a stupid app for that
[0:44:12] <%코코꾸라> Only on phones!!
[0:44:12] <DatAsuna> They weren't even 5 min episodes
[0:44:12] <jiin6> kids like the short dicks
[0:44:13] <Vaun0x> YES SPOT ON
[0:44:13] <%LoneFonte> yikes
[0:44:13] <invalidarg56> Quibi
[0:44:13] <+tigerfang86> WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG
[0:44:13] <%Spydurman> yup
[0:44:14] <+ianabstract> Short content doesn't have to pay union rates
[0:44:14] <wibbwobbler> tried to blame covid
[0:44:14] <HotMafia81> IE: not enough time to accomplish anything polished or narrative in nature
[0:44:15] <+The_RDDM> Literal toilet entertainment
[0:44:15] <invalidarg56> Is bad
[0:44:15] <MyNameIsRasus> I have never heard of that up until today
[0:44:15] <+xmetalicdemonx> yes
[0:44:15] <%SirGO0SE> they could have just not done it and instead paid rent for everyone in like 2 states
[0:44:16] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt also got around union rules, apparently
[0:44:16] <%BinaryFireball> what a greaaatt idea
[0:44:17] <+Qsmash_> @PatStaresAt and exclusively on your phone. no other platform
[0:44:18] <samcast1> sounds like someone to take money from
[0:44:18] <%DianaTheAscian> that was doomed to fail
[0:44:18] <DatAsuna> they were normal episode CUT INTO 5 mins
[0:44:20] <+LynbellDaYo> shitty netflix focused on mobile platforms, created by elderly folk btw who know what the kids like
[0:44:24] <Djinnazz> Which would have worked if it was on anything OTHER than mobile.
[0:44:24] <$RealThiele> they have tends of dollars still
[0:44:27] <DatAsuna> And foced into portrait without being shot for it
[0:44:27] <studleydoorite> is that the one that was mobile only for no reason?
[0:44:29] <+CptnCampy61> Oh god I got a stadia ad
[0:44:32] <@commanderclaw> Imagine all the good that money could have done if given to charity

[0:45:38] <%moogleboy1984> Antagonistic relationships are the healthiest, because you don't bottle emotions and can generally talk things out.

[0:49:01] <%scrumbotime> Take that money and just say that you're "Still working on it" when you get asked until the Stadia disappears
[0:49:01] <DXLelouch24> Chat this is just more reasons to wish death to Stadia
[0:49:07] <PirateMike_> @depressed_skeleton I hope at least they got the good kind

[0:49:54] <%Ranryu692> @PirateMike_ November 10th
[0:49:58] <%BinaryFireball> oh shit is 7 out now?
[0:49:58] <Monkey_D_Judd> November 10 for yakuza 7
[0:49:59] <$RealThiele> BotW for open world its fairly easy to play
[0:50:03] <Djinnazz> @DXLelouch24 It's stabbing itself to death in it's own crib
[0:50:07] <+akumakins> Yakuza is a great series
[0:50:10] <DatAsuna> Hell no
[0:50:11] <bob900000> LUL
[0:50:12] <PirateMike_> @Ranryu692 Thanks
[0:50:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NO
[0:50:18] <%DianaTheAscian> no
[0:50:21] <TheFramedWarlock> LUL
[0:50:22] <%cvp5127> lol no
[0:50:25] <DatAsuna> but a bad entry point
[0:50:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> People are gonna get so mad
[0:50:29] <TheFramedWarlock> It's not a remakw
[0:50:30] <+pre10cious_1> ff7r is confusing if u haven't played original
[0:50:31] <%Roundelay11> I highly disagree
[0:50:33] <TheFramedWarlock> *remake
[0:50:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOMURAAAAAAAAA
[0:50:34] <%honeyman18> Meh
[0:50:38] <wibbwobbler> it's pretty good
[0:50:38] <+Rofiarf> well not really a remake
[0:50:39] <%Lion_kun> Other than the ending only fans understand.
[0:50:40] <PirateMike_> DmC is a garbage game series
[0:50:40] <%NeoCre> I agree
[0:50:41] <%Ranryu692> OG FF7 is the only FF7 game I haven't played
[0:50:41] <$RealThiele> very bad entry point with literal plot ghosts
[0:50:42] <MyNameIsRasus> Yeah not sure about that one
[0:50:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> "It's not a remake tho hardadsakldjsakld"
[0:50:44] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat shut up
[0:50:44] <%AkronymCLT> That's exactly what I'm doing
[0:50:46] <ThorW> It's like... tangentially a remake at best at this point. You need to play FF7 to understand FF7R
[0:50:49] <Aydarkzero> there's no getting off the Nomura train now chat!
[0:50:50] <%BinaryFireball> 9 still hold up good
[0:50:52] <%Garthunox> cry more babies
[0:50:56] <Gallhint> and then they'll see the old one is boring and slow and be like EW
[0:50:56] <jiin6> ff7R feels like a sequel
[0:50:56] <%SirKeigan> Maybe
[0:50:57] <@commanderclaw> 5-9 are all good, even 8 is better than recent FF games
[0:51:00] <MyNameIsRasus> 9 best
[0:51:00] <%SaiyanShoto> I have a few friends that played FF7R first and it got them to go back and play FF7 original so Pat is right
[0:51:01] <DXLelouch24> Chat it wasnt Nomura it was Toriyama this time
[0:51:03] <bob900000> 6 should get a better port
[0:51:03] <%DianaTheAscian> isn't ff7 on everything?
[0:51:05] <Winner_92> i played ff7 original for the first time because they were making the remake. i still havent played the remake tho
[0:51:10] <+pre10cious_1> ff8 needs remake....fight me lol
[0:51:11] <%NeoCre> Your salt gives us power, fools
[0:51:11] <+deviljhojho_> words are hard
[0:51:12] <@commanderclaw> Don't donate high
[0:51:13] <DXLelouch24> Nomura tried to hold them back
[0:51:14] <Aydarkzero> why play the original when you can just watch videos on it LUL
[0:51:23] <%adzy2k6> I always get out of midgar and then stop, then need to replay because I forgot what happened. I'm at the point where I can't face playing it because i've done it so many times
[0:51:24] <$joylent_blue> LUL oh no
[0:51:32] <%DianaTheAscian> ff8 needs to be deleted for our world
[0:51:33] <$RealThiele> id agree that FF7R is a sequel, messing with time, since the lifestream extends across space and time
[0:51:41] <%DianaTheAscian> from*
[0:51:42] <Buka_Zero> nahaz
[0:51:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god, hitting enter too soon in a donation message is the worse.

[0:52:45] <%AyotoCorp> AyotoCorp subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 26 months, currently on a 26 month streak! Damn, 26 months. That's almost enough to pay for a single day of streaming one game.
[0:52:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HES SELF AWARE?

[0:53:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BallerSwagBro9k You've made multiple compilations, how do YOU not know this?
[0:53:08] <+blastazoid00> RNG and heat gague
[0:53:11] <MyNameIsRasus> quick, get woolie on here so he can be bored
[0:53:11] <%Birdigalore> Too bad it's objectively worse than Bard and Dancer
[0:53:12] <%ssjklyco> Any reporter who reports accurately in North Korea would disagree
[0:53:13] <%Giggalith> Super clunky
[0:53:13] <+Midknightsun316> I'm playing FF 14 right now so its fine
[0:53:15] <%CzeekyPlays> :)
[0:53:16] <+pre10cious_1> FF14 is amazing!!!
[0:53:19] <$RealThiele> fuck Bozjan atm
[0:53:22] <+Zebylth> im leveling machinist right now lol
[0:53:23] <+Clundy> Why are Twitch lawyers such big bitch babies to big man child to music lawyers?
[0:53:30] <%Pukenasty> get a snack go to bathroom, its ffxiv talk time
[0:53:31] <%Laecerelius> I hated the RNG basic combo
[0:53:31] <+blastazoid00> FF14 sucks, I love FF14
[0:53:37] <%cvp5127> ff14 stream now
[0:54:00] <%HarpuiaRivers> HarpuiaRivers subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:54:05] <+LynbellDaYo> if the stars aligned
[0:54:09] <+SH1NK1R0> It was convoluted and didn’t have an intuitive rotation. If you didn’t look up a guide you were almost always playing it wrong and you could feel it
[0:54:09] <%Metballs> They were meta in StB
[0:54:13] <%Taisuru> FF14 stream do it
[0:54:15] <+Clundy> Isn’t it a sponsored stream today? LUL
[0:54:19] <%butthurtdave> like Lance and Hunting Horn in MH
[0:54:20] <%transporterthesequel> Machinist was a conflicting design philosophy. They tried to make it a gunslinger with some mech things tangentially attached. It was a horrible decision.
[0:54:22] <+crowmium> All classes are V I A B L E, Pat.
[0:54:27] <UndeadManatee> i played MCH back then lol
[0:54:27] <$RealThiele> ninja with bad latency
[0:54:30] <+blastazoid00> @Metballs For like a minute LUL
[0:54:32] <Make_me_mad> As much as I like the idea of Pat bailing on a sponsored stream like an asshole
[0:54:34] <Aydarkzero> wait what
[0:54:36] <+BIumen> WHAT why
[0:54:37] <%Ranryu692> WHAT
[0:54:37] <+AMagicalFlute> Machinist now is dope though
[0:54:40] <+Midknightsun316> Oh god, I remember there!
[0:54:43] <Explodincatz> that sounds terrible

[0:54:48] <Aydarkzero> are you SERIOUS!?
[0:54:50] <%Ranryu692> THAT'S THE DUMBEST SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD
[0:54:51] <+Midknightsun316> I remember that*
[0:54:52] <%Laecerelius> It was terrible
[0:54:53] <+StooEsq> What?
[0:54:53] <%cvp5127> rng LUL
[0:54:54] <+Midknightsun316> It was bad
[0:54:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Ah, a 25% chance to get a full combo
[0:54:58] <%DedlokPM> oh, so like archer
[0:54:59] <+Calek> nothing like a DPS class that's not guaranteed DPS
[0:55:04] <%CzeekyPlays> That sounds like where Monk is at now
[0:55:05] <$RealThiele> Arcane mage feels
[0:55:08] <%s1rcuit> ow
[0:55:09] <+blastazoid00> Machine now is cool robot and exlosions
[0:55:10] <%Taisuru> @AMagicalFlute It's dope but my brain short ciruits when you get to the overheat rotation T_T
[0:55:18] <+crowmium> ? this is normal MMO stuff, it is extremely easy to play DNC
[0:55:24] <%cylish> But now MCH has a GIGA DRILL BREAKKKKAAA!
[0:55:25] <Aydarkzero> did the 2nd or 3rd hit at least do higher damage?
[0:55:35] <Lionrebellion> bard is ass
[0:55:36] <%moogleboy1984> BLM under 60 says hi
[0:55:38] <+crowmium> yes Aydarkzero
[0:55:43] <$RealThiele> Dancer coming along and pushing bard over and taking his lunch
[0:55:45] <%DianaTheAscian> how did that ship?
[0:55:47] <%LtSurge> LtSurge subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! 27 months and more to come, any chance of more FF14 streams?
[0:55:47] <%Laecerelius> Shotting your drill feels so fucking GOOOOOOOD!!
[0:55:52] <Aydarkzero> that's still weird though
[0:55:54] <%Taisuru> @crowmium MCH was way more dependant on its procs than DNC is
[0:55:58] <Djinnazz> @PatStaresAt That's like playing Rogue in Wow and your Evicerate had a chance to just miss.
[0:56:00] <+blastazoid00> Also there was the stupid turret pet
[0:56:02] <MyNameIsRasus> GIGA
[0:56:06] <+BIumen> and you do sick flips
[0:56:08] <%Metballs> Also lol the old heat guage
[0:56:08] <%Ranryu692> you said drill twice lol

[0:56:13] <+Arkfyre> reassemble drill Kreygasm
[0:56:14] <%HarpuiaRivers> psaDab

[0:57:25] <Psyramics> WOW that's a statement
[0:57:26] <+akumakins> called out
[0:57:26] <%Typhaeon> Oh snap
[0:57:27] <DatAsuna> Soma's story is all about being too smooth brain to understand brain copies aren't soul transfers
[0:57:28] <Daxalog> Does that explain why no ones talking about the new Amnesia?
[0:57:28] <cowardlord> Straight up wrong
[0:57:31] <MyNameIsRasus> WOW THAT'S A CALLOUT
[0:57:32] <%weissguard> LUL LUL LUL
[0:57:34] <%king_wragles> I wonder what life is like just CHOOSING to be wrong

[0:57:42] <%captain_thickthighs> h
[0:57:42] <DatAsuna> I don't enjoy stories about protags too stupid to get the premise
[0:57:43] <Saltmeisterr> YEAH DISC ROOM
[0:57:50] <shinichizio> To be fair the guy in Soma thought Soma's story was dumb too
[0:57:53] <PirateMike_> Are you getting a cyberpunk review copy?
[0:57:58] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HERESY ASUNA
[0:58:01] <+Merhabi> Somas story featured some very dumb characters who didn't understand how anything works
[0:58:13] <DatAsuna> Like the main character doesn't understand step 1 of the basic premise of the game
[0:58:18] <Aydarkzero> oh yeah isn't Paige trying to get her own streaming room?
[0:58:18] <%NeoCre> Penumbra was the first, DD was the best. Like PUBG to Fortnight
[0:58:20] <+Merhabi> soma is a story about a person who has never read any scifi
[0:58:20] <Arek_1> LUL
[0:58:20] <%walternatorz> paige gets the money sub from me, pat gets the dirty prime sub
[0:58:21] <MyNameIsRasus> @shinichizio yeah, cuz he was a dumdum
[0:58:21] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Soma story would be a classic if it was released in 1902
[0:58:22] <%ChestMimik> There was an attempt
[0:58:31] <Aydarkzero> hours!
[0:58:33] <%HarpuiaRivers> Has Pat down the new ffxiv content yet psaCaw
[0:58:36] <%DianaTheAscian> Within the day
[0:58:37] <%cvp5127> stadia trending for once LUL
[0:58:37] <+Rofiarf> what statement?
[0:58:41] <$joylent_blue> btw doesnt Cyberpunk have licensed music in it? how's that gonna work with the new DMCA shit monkaS

[0:58:47] <%transporterthesequel> Horray double money!
[0:58:47] <donkymagooterson> except for when paige becomes the screaming infant on pat's stream
[0:58:51] <+AMagicalFlute> Stadia is hot ass
[0:58:51] <ohfricktrig> LUL
[0:58:51] <PirateMike_> Stadia cant catch a break
[0:58:53] <Badgerconda_> I just got here, what is this all about?
[0:58:54] <+Merhabi> by EOD today we would like to apologize for this dumb ass
[0:58:54] <HotMafia81> He was probably on the fucking clock at time of tweet
[0:58:55] <%DianaTheAscian> they made that in the last hour of the work day
[0:58:56] <DatAsuna> If soma's story was release din 2902 it'd be a short story you could flip through in half an hour and that'd be more forgivable
[0:58:57] <+akumakins> They had to save the brand power of Stadia!!!
[0:58:58] <jorniev> i dont remember if that has happened before
[0:59:02] <Aydarkzero> to prideful to let it die

[1:24:27] <$joylent_blue> if they think its suicide, its NEVER suicide
[1:24:29] <mar_krow> can’t do glass bridge or stairs
[1:24:29] <HotMafia81> Rich people never kill themselves or feel sad

[1:24:36] <mar_krow> Or elevator
[1:24:40] <%Sotetsu> Everything points to suicide... so it is 100% not a suicide!
[1:24:40] <%encrouched> "May I please have an entire apartment made out of glass, floating in perfume, served in a mans hat?"
[1:24:44] <%Cozy90> SNUCK IN
[1:24:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> At least he's like "Well, it's probably suicide, but we don't know yet."

[1:26:38] <%Typhaeon> steakRIP James Randi
[1:26:39] <%Sotetsu> I don't want police going into my memories when I'm dead. That's almost as bad as my browser history.

[1:26:46] <%s1rcuit> based on the on all the glass windows and stairs and shit she probably was suicidal
[1:26:47] <%realm_forge> Apartments like this freak me the fuck out
[1:26:47] <jorniev> MIRROR MASTER!?

[1:27:16] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[1:27:16] <+LynbellDaYo> whoa, she ate, who know
[1:27:18] <gustavozxd> so I guess the game is well optimized?
[1:27:23] <sexdrugsvideogames> this is what the devs think rich condos look like
[1:27:31] <+rottingpastry> haha, he drove back to the apartment just to say, "I guess that was her last meal."
[1:27:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> This isn't dangerous at all, no sir.
[1:27:38] <+rottingpastry> what a dedicated detectiver
[1:27:40] <%encrouched> BILL WHERES THE BRAIN DISK!?
[1:27:41] <BliVru> No mouse?

[1:27:56] <Vaun0x> CARL NOOO
[1:27:58] <%MrBleeeh> dats a lot of logs
[1:28:06] <+rottingpastry> text error log one is missin the opening parenthesis
[1:28:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @g0atmeal We love the PS5 and are not being held hostage by the microphone system
[1:28:10] <jorniev> no mouse
[1:28:11] <BliVru> Have you ever noticed that everytime a computer shows up there never a mouse?
[1:28:14] <sexdrugsvideogames> wait, the detective is also a crazy science guy? super realistic
[1:28:14] <%realm_forge> Leeets doo the tiiime waaarp agaaaain
[1:28:17] <dukenux> just gimme the data. RAW
[1:28:20] <+rottingpastry> the data was a chair
[1:28:20] <%linSP> evee what is this digimon
[1:28:25] <gustavozxd> time to get comfy, gonna take a bit
[1:28:31] <+tigerfang86> RAW CHAIR SSOUND
[1:28:37] <+tigerfang86> RAW CHAIR POWER
[1:28:41] <Saltmeisterr> yo this seems cool as hell
[1:28:46] <%Laecerelius> She don't understand chair
[1:28:53] <annearkie> Yo I love ChairCore
[1:28:57] <%MrBleeeh> "human" skills
[1:28:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Subtitles say "Evee" 😡
[1:28:59] <sexdrugsvideogames> in the future you control your pc with your eyes only
[1:29:00] <%Laecerelius> "human"
[1:29:02] <rekinom> Eevee huh? Y'all gonna get suuuuuuued
[1:29:06] <HotMafia81> But the real question is: what should we make Evee evolve into?
[1:29:06] <%ChestMimik> They put the brain in a computer didn't they
[1:29:08] <+tigerfang86> Computer be like "The hell is a chair"
[1:29:09] <+rottingpastry> oh good, we can add our biases to reconstructions cool this won't go wrong
[1:29:10] <+TheBitingIrish> Yeah, 100%
[1:29:10] <BoneofMalkav> The Raw Chair Sound of one wrestler slamming said chair into another wrestler's face
[1:29:10] <%PrimalDweeb> Humans suck.
[1:29:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> What should we evolve eevee into?
[1:29:12] <%Pappajimbo> ah afor puzzles
[1:29:12] <KoryMccool> what is this interesting nonesenesse
[1:29:15] <shinichizio> "This is a chair." "No, this is a cow"
[1:29:23] <%encrouched> Evee is the killer
[1:29:30] <dukenux> "This is not a chair"
[1:29:30] <+TheBitingIrish> SuBjEcTiVe
[1:29:32] <SaltyAzteca> REMEMBER THAT
[1:29:37] <HotMafia81> Hasn't our character done this before?
[1:29:38] <haitakaa> wtf is a chair Kappa
[1:29:38] <+LynbellDaYo> I'm so lost, to be honest
[1:29:41] <+tigerfang86> Cool info logs
[1:29:42] <%Evan2Echoes> "can happen" translates as "will happen in the game"
[1:29:45] <%encrouched> it is a hat
[1:29:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> These logs seem like they have legitimately important information.
[1:29:47] <gustavozxd> they're cool probably
[1:29:48] <sexdrugsvideogames> #sposored
[1:29:49] <yourliteraldog> You laugh but humans are fucking amazing at sorting and categorizing thing.
[1:29:50] <%ChestMimik> This is ABSOLUTELY a Shou Tucker scenario
[1:29:51] <Make_me_mad> So it's like a memory reconstruction done by AI dungeon.
[1:29:52] <+Shacklebox> Novum
[1:29:52] <+tigerfang86> Agree
[1:29:53] <Saltmeisterr> yeah
[1:29:54] <MyNameIsRasus> ME TOO
[1:29:55] <+dks_junkie> this is fucking lit
[1:29:57] <%honeyman18> explaining the premise is pretty great
[1:29:57] <gustavozxd> its the best
[1:30:01] <Vaun0x> YEE
[1:30:02] <%encrouched> I work in AI, this is legt so far haha
[1:30:05] <SaltyAzteca> Immerse me in your crazy sci fi world
[1:30:06] <@commanderclaw> Fictional technology with rules is the shit
[1:30:07] <jorniev> ME TOO PAT
[1:30:12] <Psyramics> upscaliners
[1:30:16] <dukenux> Jim Pickens??
[1:30:18] <Psyramics> upscalers
[1:30:26] <%ChestMimik> I don't like that answer
[1:30:27] <dukenux> ZOOREAL
[1:30:32] <sexdrugsvideogames> yada yada machine learnind
[1:30:33] <dapperdoop> spoons
[1:30:37] <%captain_thickthighs> so this whole game's premise is when people use enhance on like CIS
[1:30:41] <%machshop> this guy sounds kinda like the voice actor for Batou in GitS
[1:30:48] <dukenux> picking Batou's va was a good choice
[1:30:55] <DXLelouch24> Thats because it is
[1:30:55] <Psyramics> @machshop because it is
[1:30:56] <yourliteraldog> He is Batou
[1:30:59] <dukenux> this is eerily reminiscent of GitS SAC technobabble
[1:30:59] <ThDark> Thanks Batou for explaining all this
[1:31:01] <%captain_thickthighs> fuck your right
[1:31:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is straight up machine learning.
[1:31:02] <sexdrugsvideogames> nice
[1:31:04] <zipfile777> NotLikeThis
[1:31:04] <DXLelouch24> Ansem became a Detective
[1:31:05] <%BinaryFireball> ML is just statistics
[1:31:05] <%machshop> oh neat
[1:31:07] <KoryMccool> this is legitimately cool
[1:31:11] <%redthebaron> cool
[1:31:14] <$OddballEA> ok is this fucking ansem?
[1:31:16] <%crimsonharvest> this is how bias is introduced to AI systems
[1:31:16] <%ChestMimik> I DON'T LIKE THAT ANSWER
[1:31:24] <%BinaryFireball> I like that it's real
[1:31:24] <+rottingpastry> this is how you'd do it, yeah
[1:31:28] <yourliteraldog> What dose horny look like to an AI
[1:31:37] <haitakaa> actual computer science
[1:31:42] <+The_Protagonist> thepro95Pyro
[1:31:42] <+MattTheSpratt> @crimsonharvest 👈👈🐍
[1:31:42] <Vaun0x> emotional distress????
[1:31:48] <%BinaryFireball> @yourliteraldog do you really want to know?
[1:31:55] <%sleepers1mulant> this shit hurts my monkey brain
[1:31:55] <%PrimalDweeb> He said Robust weird...
[1:32:01] <%linSP> its just there
[1:32:02] <KoryMccool> "cool:
[1:32:05] <+BIumen> colonel?
[1:32:06] <dukenux> Cool :)
[1:32:06] <$OddballEA> robest
[1:32:11] <KaironFortressKnight> This sounds like the Admiral/Akuma
[1:32:13] <+lethallylactic> cool
[1:32:13] <sexdrugsvideogames> oh, so you cant see bullets
[1:32:14] <%toastybites> this is actually the process for making new experiments, etc
[1:32:15] <BoneBagMel> IIs that the colonel from MGS?
[1:32:15] <+tigerfang86> BIG LOSERS
[1:32:17] <%TheSphereHunter> Is that Batou?
[1:32:17] <%logoth_> AWESOME
[1:32:19] <Vaun0x> "...............cool"
[1:32:20] <thelonechris> I think I'm too stupid to understand
[1:32:21] <%Piemen99> Love theses nerds
[1:32:21] <%logoth_> AWESOME TO THE MAX
[1:32:21] <CappuccinoGuil> oooh he's RAIDEN
[1:32:22] <%DappercatEsquire> LISTEN TO THIS PRIMER SHIT
[1:32:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean, this isn't too complicated at this point.
[1:32:23] <dukenux> ACTUAL science nerds
[1:32:23] <%MrBleeeh> psaBig nerds
[1:32:25] <shinichizio> awesomussle
[1:32:26] <%Evan2Echoes> it's making me wonder why Carl left the project
[1:32:26] <HotMafia81> I miss doing this kind of nerd shit
[1:32:26] <gustavozxd> mega nerds
[1:32:26] <+blastazoid00> Big awesome nerds
[1:32:27] <+lazysaiyajin> very good
[1:32:28] <+LynbellDaYo> the voice acting is really on point
[1:32:29] <%crimsonharvest> This is like watching Primer
[1:32:30] <+The_Protagonist> thepro95Pyro thepro95Pyro thepro95Pyro
[1:32:30] <%ChestMimik> They absolutely put someone's brain in that computer
[1:32:37] <dots4eyes> Suzi spotted! VoHiYo HeyGuys
[1:32:38] <$joylent_blue> Suzi <3
[1:32:39] <%PrimalDweeb> Batou is love.
[1:32:39] <%BinaryFireball> even uses python
[1:32:39] <MyNameIsRasus> They got the "Nerds working on project" feel EXACTLY right
[1:32:40] <CappuccinoGuil> Raiden and Ansem too lamo
[1:32:45] <%BinaryFireball> yay devs
[1:32:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Richard Epcar is the shit
[1:32:45] <%logoth_> STOP ALL THE Downloadin!!
[1:32:46] <+tigerfang86> we've created FAST TRAVEL
[1:32:52] <%linSP> this feels like watching a traffic school course
[1:33:00] <%devanmuse> If we're dealing with recreating memories, how would it handle people being mistaken about things, or drawing incorrect conclusions? Like, say you were attacked by someone: you didn't see them, but you're "certain" that it was your neighbor. Would the attacker look like your neighbor in the reconstruction, even if it wasn't him?
[1:33:04] <a_mad_dragon> oh i thought i recognized the voice
[1:33:04] <%shurtal> GOD i miss good Ghost in the Shell
[1:33:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's also super tall, like 6'5" or something. Not relevant, but just cool.
[1:33:07] <KoryMccool> oh i never knew batou was epcar
[1:33:11] <a_mad_dragon> batou is the shit
[1:33:14] <jorniev> OH MY GOOD ALL OF THIS IS JSUT A SIMULATIONS ISNT IT!?
[1:33:15] <%SwdVengeance> Is it wrong that I wanna buy this just to listen to Batou talk more
[1:33:16] <CappuccinoGuil> HE'S KOBAYAKAWA TOO
[1:33:17] <%ElkRiverDog> !uptime
[1:33:17] <$OddballEA> oh my God instead of hearts its brains in this
[1:33:18] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 33m.
[1:33:22] <sexdrugsvideogames> if it was like primer they would use it to game the stock market
[1:33:26] <mellorolo> nerd? what about you? youre playing a VG
[1:33:31] <+tigerfang86> MULTIVERSE SELECTOR
[1:33:33] <MyNameIsRasus> batou and the major are some of the coolest characters i know
[1:33:33] <%encrouched> yep, this is how simulation theory starts
[1:33:35] <guiltyboya> @devanmuse that's the thing - you can't trust your memories
[1:33:38] <%transporterthesequel> Wait this is just Tech Bro Remember Me
[1:33:38] <+tigerfang86> oh GOD
[1:33:42] <BoneofMalkav> LUL
[1:33:46] <+tigerfang86> fuuuuuuuck
[1:33:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> THIS CANNOT GO WRONG
[1:33:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[1:33:49] <%toastybites> SICK
[1:33:52] <%linSP> no shut up that clown was REAL
[1:33:53] <%honeyman18> WOO sci-fi
[1:33:55] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Sure, makes sense.
[1:33:56] <%ChestMimik> I don't like this project at ALL this is horrible keep going
[1:33:59] <jorniev> THIS AWESOME SCIENCE
[1:34:00] <CappuccinoGuil> WHAT COULD GO WRONG
[1:34:00] <%DappercatEsquire> that's not gonna be used for scares at all
[1:34:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> "A million big teeth tall."
[1:34:05] <Ipsenscastle> a million big teeth tall
[1:34:05] <boomstickery> a million big teeth tall
[1:34:06] <$joylent_blue> a million big teeth tall
[1:34:07] <+Aikao> a million big teeth tall POGGERS
[1:34:08] <%encrouched> billion million bug teeth
[1:34:08] <jorniev> AWESOME FAKE SCIENCE
[1:34:09] <+tigerfang86> NO PROBLEMS AT ALL
[1:34:10] <Kalarchis> A million big teeth tall Pat
[1:34:12] <guiltyboya> WEIRD SCIENCE
[1:34:12] <+MattTheSpratt> this is literally how techbros think
[1:34:14] <+conradical> a million big teeth tall
[1:34:17] <sexdrugsvideogames> turn on the OBJECTIVE FILTER
[1:34:18] <%crimsonharvest> I'm kind of uneasy about this i have pretty serious dissociation sometimes
[1:34:19] <ZE_Count> Just got here whats this games deal?
[1:34:20] <%devanmuse> @guiltyboya It could allow for some really complex puzzles if played well
[1:34:20] <+rottingpastry> added networking icon
[1:34:21] <robbtre> Big teeth is my favourite unit of measurement
[1:34:22] <dots4eyes> What could POSSIBLY go wrong?
[1:34:32] <%BinaryFireball> ya'll remember that JLO movie?
[1:34:32] <+tigerfang86> we created an inventory system
[1:34:39] <sexdrugsvideogames> zoom in, now make it sharper!
[1:34:41] <jorniev> LUL
[1:34:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait, these fuckers are just doing scrum meetings.
[1:34:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're totally doing weekly scrum meetings.
[1:34:51] <BoneofMalkav> I can't imagine how Eevee would construct Pat's memories and emotions LUL That would be a trip
[1:34:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is fucking agile project planning.
[1:34:56] <narusao> everything subjective is represented thru anime waifus
[1:34:56] <Boogius> this is literally just a bunch of end-of-iteration meetings
[1:34:57] <guiltyboya> @devanmuse that's kind of what I expected at the time with the game "Remember Me"
[1:34:58] <+rottingpastry> the Ram
[1:35:02] <$joylent_blue> ZE_Count detective work based on MEMORY SCIENCE i think
[1:35:05] <%linSP> how many sticks of ram do they need for brain memory
[1:35:08] <%ChestMimik> Hey what happens if you just mark all memories as objective?
[1:35:09] <%SweetCheeksTVR> my God this sounds like a fucking SCRUM meeting
[1:35:10] <%Emperor_Machinus> Lets be honest a living pile of a million teeth that barks would be horrifying
[1:35:11] <%PrimalDweeb> Ram me harder.
[1:35:11] <%Laecerelius> Gotta download more RAM!
[1:35:12] <Vaun0x> I dont like how "alive" this magic AI machine sounds
[1:35:12] <MyNameIsRasus> Computer Devil Trigger
[1:35:14] <jorniev> SO its jsut and nvdia drive for memories!?
[1:35:18] <sexdrugsvideogames> @BoneofMalkav everything would be huge
[1:35:19] <+MattTheSpratt> @linSP yes
[1:35:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SweetCheeksTVR RIGHT!?!
[1:35:22] <%Typhaeon> This far in the future, there shouldn't be a segmentation between RAM and storage any longer
[1:35:22] <%TheMattman1313> OH Richard Epcar is Raiden in MKX that's where I recognize his voice from
[1:35:22] <+rottingpastry> lol nlp good luck, motherfuckers
[1:35:24] <Manwad> i am glued to my seat
[1:35:25] <MyNameIsRasus> @SweetCheeksTVR I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
[1:35:26] <dapperdoop> gotta make a save state to use more ram
[1:35:27] <CappuccinoGuil> @SweetCheeksTVR I mean... it is
[1:35:28] <%crimsonharvest> is this the Megami Tensei computer
[1:35:29] <%Piemen99> Science guy: Yo this is some eldritch nightmare fuel shit......Well we got the funding so let's keep on going
[1:35:29] <boomstickery> youd need to many petabytes of ram
[1:35:32] <%SweetCheeksTVR> YEYEYE
[1:35:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt how did you get video of the inside of my work?
[1:35:33] <Thalchampz> mkv good quality
[1:35:34] <Vaun0x> ewww
[1:35:34] <donkymagooterson> I'm pretty sure they're real nerds. Although the science may be questionable
[1:35:36] <HotMafia81> NERDS FUCKING LOVE .MKV FILES
[1:35:39] <boomstickery> a tera flo
[1:35:41] <boomstickery> p

[1:36:04] <+tigerfang86> always be nice to robit
[1:36:06] <%devanmuse> @guiltyboya I'm thinking more in the sense of "high concept murder mysteries"; having to parse through junk information in memories (biases, mistakes, etc) in order to uncover the truth
[1:36:06] <%Evan2Echoes> oh jesus, be nice to the AI so that she can learn
[1:36:07] <dapperdoop> don't make her angry

[1:37:40] <+tigerfang86> Monstars
[1:37:40] <$joylent_blue> GREAT
[1:37:41] <+MattTheSpratt> this means the dataset was based on a tiny sample size
[1:37:44] <+BIumen> fear should be the baby really
[1:37:44] <%encrouched> Tay latched onto racisn
[1:37:45] <DashXero> That sounds problematic.
[1:37:45] <yourliteraldog> Your giving her motivated reasoning
[1:37:46] <Aydarkzero> sounds good :)
[1:37:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> And arousal will be fucking toirtoises.
[1:37:47] <%ChestMimik> The baby is also fear
[1:37:47] <%depressed_skeleton> monstar???
[1:37:49] <Vaun0x> WHY
[1:37:50] <+thickshield> Thanks for the KPOPvictory @xmasterkeef420bluntninjax wow that is a cursed name

[1:37:51] <+blastazoid00> What is this game about? I feel like im in class
[1:37:54] <$joylent_blue> NOTHING COULD GO WRONG
[1:37:54] <+tigerfang86> OH NO
[1:37:55] <%linSP> what is that gremlin doing in the bottom left corner
[1:37:58] <+lethallylactic> WutFace
[1:37:59] <thelonechris> monkaS
[1:37:59] <+rottingpastry> anxiety will be represented by using your elixirs ever
[1:38:00] <%toastybites> this is VERY user unfriendly
[1:38:01] <SaltyAzteca> Which is cool tho
[1:38:03] <+MattTheSpratt> The True Dino Crisis 🐍💦
[1:38:07] <+conradical> THATS RAD
[1:38:07] <dukenux> Jpeg Cat
[1:38:08] <gustavozxd> that's more like "HYPE"
[1:38:10] <%LiquidDinosaur> i feel like anxiety is best defined as the siren that plays in Amnesia 1
[1:38:10] <%ChestMimik> Atomic Robo is rad and I wanna see Dr. Dinosaur
[1:38:11] <+TheBitingIrish> I think I'd be more afraid of one WITHOUT a gun
[1:38:11] <%Undenizen> Twitch wouldn't let me NOT send a message. I don't know how this works.
[1:38:15] <jorniev> why not SHAPES OR COLORS why a THING
[1:38:16] <+blastazoid00> Kitty
[1:38:17] <%BinaryFireball> Existenz beeeches
[1:38:17] <+Link232> WHy would you want to make data jaguars in your simulation
[1:38:19] <+tigerfang86> oh no the AI understands Symbolism
[1:38:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> cat
[1:38:21] <+D00msDayDan> You have the best language pat
[1:38:23] <Boogius> I think its about people essentially mapping night terrors into a deep learning ai
[1:38:23] <%heartlesshealer> twitch stream has died, but the chat lives on. This happening to anyone else?
[1:38:27] <Boogius> but I just got here like 5 minutes ago
[1:38:28] <%ironbologna> Man jumping into this in the middle of the stream is extremely confusing
[1:38:31] <BoneofMalkav> Can JPEG Cat get along with JPEG Dog?
[1:38:31] <dapperdoop> 99% contempt detected
[1:38:38] <+rottingpastry> No biogun, not existenz
[1:38:40] <$joylent_blue> heartlesshealer streams fine here
[1:38:40] <%toastybites> "We took all these stock images to make your worst nightmare"
[1:38:41] <Ell1ot> wouldn't Pat's fear be represented by a raptor with a syringe?
[1:38:43] <yourliteraldog> That might be good allow the AI to be irrational, so it won't cold logic it's self to mass murder
[1:38:44] <Solokaldaka> monkaS i hate it, lets keep going
[1:38:45] <Manwad> this is how AI Silent Hill is made
[1:38:47] <BlackMage66652> Show the AI your dick
[1:38:47] <%honeyman18> I would pay so much to use this to photograph my interpretation of my own memories
[1:38:48] <+MattTheSpratt> silicon valley is a dangerous cult at this point
[1:38:49] <guiltyboya> WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO THAT WutFace
[1:38:52] <dukenux> he LOVES it
[1:38:53] <%Piemen99> refresh stream if stream died
[1:38:54] <%DappercatEsquire> "anyway, they want this finished up and pushed out by the end of the week, so we're gonna have to cut all this shit"
[1:38:55] <%heartlesshealer> thanks @joylent_blue
[1:38:56] <dots4eyes> You love it now...
[1:38:58] <treehouse63> it happened to me for a sec, might just be bad connection on our part
[1:39:00] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Admetlly getting killed by a velociraptor with a gun will earn you a VIP ticket to Valhalla
[1:39:01] <DashXero> This sounds highly problematic.
[1:39:02] <+tigerfang86> but WE GOTTA DO IT PAT
[1:39:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> great idea
[1:39:07] <+tigerfang86> THE FUTURE IS NOW
[1:39:08] <ZE_Count> BE GOD
[1:39:09] <donkymagooterson> "something"
[1:39:10] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat I couldn't disagree with you more.
[1:39:10] <Aydarkzero> it's always playing god
[1:39:11] <%Typhaeon> I'd love to see this exist
[1:39:13] <+rottingpastry> If I have a memory of my dick, will the AI make it 10 feet tall?
[1:39:13] <MyNameIsRasus> TIME WARPS??
[1:39:13] <Ipsenscastle> just put it in the UI goddamnit
[1:39:14] <%Laecerelius> A raptor made of syringes? A raptor with a syringe for its toe claw?
[1:39:14] <+MattTheSpratt> it's also Extremely White Boy Perspective
[1:39:15] <@commanderclaw> BECOME AS GODS
[1:39:15] <+funnyfunnykid> DID IT SAY TIMEWARPS!?
[1:39:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Just take a step to the left
[1:39:15] <ZE_Count> BECOME AS GODS!
[1:39:17] <%linSP> thanks black mirror
[1:39:19] <+blastazoid00> But doing that sounds fun
[1:39:19] <$dalmek> I love that just looking at these logs fills you with dread
[1:39:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> UNIVERSAL TRUTH PAT
[1:39:23] <dots4eyes> All the advantages with NONE of the disadvantages
[1:39:24] <RiverBirch> This is fucking uncomfortable
[1:39:29] <DashXero> This sounds "destroy the research and anyone who worked on it" levels of problematic.
[1:39:29] <%Piemen99> But dont 't you want to become as gods pat?
[1:39:30] <gustavozxd> @Manwad that sounds like the coolest game and the worst most horrible place
[1:39:30] <Vaun0x> BECOME AS GODS
[1:39:33] <%ChestMimik> Just mark all dissenting memories as "subjective" no problems here
[1:39:35] <BoneofMalkav> Technology like this is what makes SHODAN and GlaDOS.
[1:39:35] <guiltyboya> BECOME AS GODS (oh, nice android booty)
[1:39:36] <%Emperor_Machinus> I think ads in dreams are the final intrusion of privacy
[1:39:38] <%PaladinDupre> BLADE RUNNER
[1:39:44] <dapperdoop> dog
[1:39:47] <sexdrugsvideogames> why not
[1:39:48] <ZE_Count> As always ask what could go wrong.
[1:39:51] <%Razputin217> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
[1:39:52] <%encrouched> the victim hated cats, so Evee thinks the murderer was... Mr. Mistoffelees
[1:39:58] <BliVru> What what happens with fetishes then?
[1:40:02] <CappuccinoGuil> I have NEVER seen a game with such realistic powerpoints, THIS IS TERRIFYING
[1:40:02] <treehouse63> We should be focusing on super pounder 600s and shit man, not this stuff
[1:40:13] <+MattTheSpratt> @ChestMimik literally!! this only takes in a lived experience of complete monsters!
[1:40:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Which means time will jump around at random intervals.
[1:40:25] <%linSP> so can you cum in warp time with this or what
[1:40:26] <%PaladinDupre> uhhhh'
[1:40:31] <+rottingpastry> the logs increase in bullshittery as they go on
[1:40:31] <boomstickery> the people whio wrote this are the sort of people who wrote primer
[1:40:32] <%Evan2Echoes> I love that they're explaining how to play the game through these videoss
[1:40:32] <%heartlesshealer> stream returneth for me. Time to keep listening to this horrible, horrible, poorly tested time thing
[1:40:34] <$joylent_blue> on point, powerpoint
[1:40:35] <%crimsonharvest> he invented scrubbing?
[1:40:36] <%PrimalDweeb> Did that guy just clap his ass?
[1:40:40] <chambatron> What the fuc is going on Is this a video or a game
[1:40:40] <%ChestMimik> Ah yes, making time malleable is DEFINITELY the best way to handle this technology
[1:40:48] <jorniev> this is the final frontier of invasion of privacy
[1:40:52] <+MattTheSpratt> @BliVru oh no, Fetishes Don't Exist, they're not included in the dataset because these sci-fi nerds are scared
[1:40:55] <Spartan3909> Anyone else getting dsp vibes from this camera pointed at a tv shit?
[1:40:58] <$dalmek> AGGRESSIVENESS
[1:41:01] <dapperdoop> are we gonna have anime avatars in this thing
[1:41:06] <Kalarchis> Aggressive Subjective Entities sounds super dire
[1:41:06] <+tigerfang86> uhhhhh are there gonna be EVIL MEMORIES
[1:41:07] <BoneofMalkav> I hope the avatar they decide to use as an example is that of a degenerate LUL
[1:41:07] <%cylish> Are these guys just developing a proto matrix?
[1:41:08] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> the fuck did I walk into?
[1:41:11] <%Emperor_Machinus> @chambatron A Video Game
[1:41:12] <%ChestMimik> WHY ARE THEY AGRESSIVE AND PASSIVE MR SCIENCE MAN
[1:41:12] <%toastybites> I like how this recording is slanted cuz they couldn't bother to align the projector with the camera
[1:41:13] <%transporterthesequel> Wait wut
[1:41:13] <%cvp5127> npcs?
[1:41:15] <%heartlesshealer> so furniture = passive
[1:41:18] <%s1rcuit> Meaning you're gonna have to fight memory constructs
[1:41:18] <dukenux> uh oh
[1:41:20] <SaltyAzteca> GHOSTHACK
[1:41:22] <guiltyboya> @chambatron a conceptual horror game Kappa
[1:41:24] <DashXero> I don't like the sound of that AT ALL.
[1:41:31] <dredayah> so control
[1:41:32] <MyNameIsRasus> FEELING MINDHACK
[1:41:36] <dots4eyes> Red flag words: WILL, CONTROL
[1:41:40] <%ChestMimik> This is just editable memories you made an evil computer you dumbasses
[1:41:46] <@commanderclaw> "Put this knife next to this baby and see how memories react"
[1:41:48] <annearkie> wow this is jUST how to create digital hell, literally. actual possibilities for infinite, conscious computer-brain torture
[1:41:50] <+MattTheSpratt> yeah this is hitting me bad in the way that slient hill or amnesia just -doesn't-
[1:41:56] <boomstickery> or horniness
[1:41:58] <+Basker17> Is this related to the Observer?
[1:42:02] <+blastazoid00> I feel so dum hearing this stuff
[1:42:03] <%honeyman18> So will this manifest Pat's OCD as Goblins for real?
[1:42:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm totally on board for this.
[1:42:05] <DashXero> Why not just skip the trial and label whomever you want as guilty?
[1:42:09] <+RowenCleric> I think this was how AM was born from I have no Mouth
[1:42:14] <Sunstalker> Are we creating I have no mouth but I must scream? DansGame
[1:42:15] <%ChestMimik> I was joking about making objective tags when they shouldn't but APPARENTLY the machine does way worse
[1:42:15] <+g0atmeal> Just let the AI make up its interpolations, and call it "evidence"
[1:42:17] <dukenux> @annearkie AM
[1:42:19] <%Piemen99> This science shit is wild
[1:42:21] <+rottingpastry> lol
[1:42:23] <%heartlesshealer> I'm glad pat's the one we're watching do this, with his degree and all
[1:42:23] <%Piemen99> I love it
[1:42:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> @honeyman18 Pat's brainscape would just be a mountain of goblins toppling over eachother's ass.
[1:42:26] <sleepofgiants> Is this CHEMICALS: THE GAME
[1:42:31] <+tigerfang86> usedFeels
[1:42:33] <%Typhaeon> AM was more of a Cold War thing, this is forensics-related
[1:42:33] <+rottingpastry> AM was a war computer
[1:42:34] <MyNameIsRasus> Carl fucking died
[1:42:34] <guiltyboya> @blastazoid00 just stop trying to convince yourself that you are dumb
[1:42:34] <SaltyAzteca> BibleThump
[1:42:38] <%Undenizen> why is this person navigating files in a BASH shell?
[1:42:40] <+BIumen> munka
[1:42:41] <+blastazoid00> Caaaarl
[1:42:43] <+tigerfang86> Carl......
[1:42:43] <%Piemen99> Brain dead maybe?
[1:42:44] <%heartlesshealer> rip carl
[1:42:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> CAAAAAARL
[1:42:45] <+rottingpastry> Carl got trapped in cyberhell and died
[1:42:46] <annearkie> carl? :(
[1:42:51] <%ItalianWaifu> that bitch got lost in the thiunder dome
[1:42:51] <%BinaryFireball> get innnnn
[1:42:54] <%linSP> he entered the matrix
[1:42:54] <%honeyman18> psaGoblin psaGoblin all over Pat's memories
[1:42:55] <dapperdoop> FBI?
[1:42:55] <%heartlesshealer> vegetation
[1:42:56] <BliVru> He got trapped in the MEME memories
[1:42:56] <MyNameIsRasus> Most likely tested it on himself and is now a ghost in the shell
[1:43:00] <dukenux> Is Carl's brain on the disk
[1:43:01] <%ChestMimik> Remember when they opened with "This isn't legal"? Yeah maybe there's a reason
[1:43:02] <DashXero> It sounds like something bad should have happened to Carl if he had anything to do with building this abomination of a technology.
[1:43:03] <%toastybites> OLD HANDS
[1:43:03] <+blastazoid00> @guiltyboya Im doing my best

[1:43:07] <guiltyboya> JUST SLAP IT IN WITH THE MIGHT OF ZEUS
[1:43:08] <+baka_sugoi> is this the matrix?
[1:43:11] <sexdrugsvideogames> ominous foreshadowing
[1:43:13] <boomstickery> lol look at that futuristic SSD that can hold a brain of data
[1:43:13] <+tigerfang86> well
[1:43:16] <+tigerfang86> here we go
[1:43:17] <yourliteraldog> If this works as intended the your literally fucking with persons mind. Like running Judy.exe, only it could maybe feel pain
[1:43:20] <SaltyAzteca> Oh good it talks.
[1:43:20] <%toastybites> oh god I have undergrad neuroscience flashbacks
[1:43:21] <BoneofMalkav> All these years and advances in technology and software... and we're still using DOS prompts LUL

[1:43:38] <guiltyboya> @blastazoid00 that's the spirit SeemsGood
[1:43:43] <%transporterthesequel> Oh the whole PLACE is the animus?
[1:43:44] <ZE_Count> shit getting real

[1:43:48] <%Emperor_Machinus> @guiltyboya You don't want to slap it with the might of Zeus it will end up pregnant
[1:43:51] <treehouse63> Intergalactic planetary
[1:43:51] <shinichizio> Why did you program the information graph to slowly approach
[1:43:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BoneofMalkav you'd be surprised how much of the world runs on doss
[1:43:53] <dukenux> It's like AC, but you're invading other people's minds
[1:43:53] <+MattTheSpratt> OHHHHH
[1:43:54] <SaltyAzteca> EXM PUPPETMASTER

[1:44:01] <dukenux> or like Inception, but with dead people
[1:44:04] <%transporterthesequel> Why did the lights turn off? And when did he put on the helmet?
[1:44:04] <%ChestMimik> This is working as intended and it ALREADY looks evil
[1:44:05] <RiverBirch> Oh I fucking hate this oh lord
[1:44:06] <+ImTrin> time to see how it all goes horribly wrong
[1:44:06] <$OddballEA> Yeah jack in like megaman
[1:44:07] <jorniev> SO IT WAS A HORROR GAME

[1:44:25] <%cylish> and now I see why its a horror game
[1:44:28] <dapperdoop> I hope there's a weird fucked up cat somewhere

[1:44:29] <+WackyGear> tv

[1:44:33] <+rottingpastry> 5 is not here
[1:44:35] <$dalmek> is the TV perfectly fine?
[1:44:36] <%SlingPlaysGames> is this sci fi obra dinn?
[1:44:37] <MyNameIsRasus> These visuals are fucking awesome
[1:44:37] <gustavozxd> it's all blurred and shit that's awesome
[1:44:39] <ZE_Count> IS this the new Psychonauts???
[1:44:44] <sexdrugsvideogames> the bag is not there
[1:44:46] <%toastybites> I am fucking so in
[1:44:51] <dukenux> yeeea
[1:44:52] <+tigerfang86> god it's so freaky
[1:44:56] <%doc_ock_rokc> It looks like a poorly reconstructed photogrametry model
[1:44:56] <annearkie> ???
[1:44:56] <Ipsenscastle> this is such a weird clever aesthetic
[1:44:57] <%linSP> so is he in a vr helm
[1:44:57] <+tigerfang86> aaaaaaa
[1:45:02] <guiltyboya> "Remember To Observe Me Within : Signifier edition"
[1:45:02] <+zeejaymac> This reminds me of Ethan's first house from Heavy Rain
[1:45:04] <+BIumen> seeing sound?
[1:45:04] <dukenux> everything's melting like in those AI generated images
[1:45:05] <%ChestMimik> Clock's haunted
[1:45:09] <%heartlesshealer> Edges more clearly defined than backs of tables! Yes! People pay attention that way
[1:45:10] <+rottingpastry> yes...the digital demon is an interesting glitch
[1:45:12] <%ItalianWaifu> clocks dont work in dreams
[1:45:13] <%BinaryFireball> time, she's expecting something
[1:45:14] <primarch_lupercal> reminds me of observer
[1:45:14] <%linSP> nah its not magic shut up
[1:45:14] <%s1rcuit> could be a filtering error
[1:45:15] <+funnyfunnykid> This clock will spit at you
[1:45:15] <boomstickery> she didnt knwo what time it was
[1:45:16] <+ImTrin> the ticking on the clock made her nervous?
[1:45:17] <KaliasTV> It's just a cthulock
[1:45:17] <Parapattern> Clock causes anxiety
[1:45:18] <+tigerfang86> Botchamania
[1:45:19] <%bread_assassin> So you can't see the time?
[1:45:20] <%PrimalDweeb> LUL
[1:45:22] <%toastybites> Narrator: It was not a filtering error
[1:45:22] <annearkie> hmmm could she have anxiety about time?
[1:45:23] <%DappercatEsquire> cool lumpy bed
[1:45:25] <dukenux> You're encoder's FUCKED
[1:45:25] <+sp_abadidea> the true 144p nightmare
[1:45:25] <%Undenizen> it looks like a bad 3D scan of a room
[1:45:25] <BoneofMalkav> like the video was data moshed
[1:45:26] <%TheSphereHunter> it kinda looks like walking through a pre-rendered background
[1:45:26] <%SweetCheeksTVR> It looks like a low res 3D scan
[1:45:27] <%YabbaTroll> this looks like a 3d scan of a room
[1:45:28] <Saltmeisterr> this straight up looks like an ai generayed image
[1:45:29] <%Agami23> which is a cool aesthetic
[1:45:31] <dukenux> *your
[1:45:31] <$joylent_blue> your memories are low poly
[1:45:33] <ZE_Count> The mind is a odd thing
[1:45:34] <boomstickery> she got wasted and blacked out
[1:45:35] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt this game would be scarier if you had a health bar
[1:45:35] <sexdrugsvideogames> the gameplay should be you finding the differences in 3d space
[1:45:36] <+rottingpastry> she was high as fuck
[1:45:36] <Thalchampz> it's like bad AI machine learning. WIAT, IT IS MACHINE LEARNING
[1:45:37] <%s1rcuit> @boomstickery good idea
[1:45:40] <Daxalog> Imagine walking through a YTP in vr.
[1:45:41] <%TheMattman1313> Looks exactly like a 3D scan of a room that didn't get all of the necessary angles
[1:45:45] <%SlingPlaysGames> this is sci fi demon Obra Dinn! I'm so in!
[1:45:46] <+MattTheSpratt> whoever this voice actor is, they have a pitch perfect alexa

[1:45:51] <+rottingpastry> Good. Let me enter the hellscape
[1:45:52] <+tigerfang86> THE MIND ZONE
[1:45:54] <%ShogunNoonto> this game looks like me trying to learn blender
[1:45:54] <+tigerfang86> the TRUE MIND ZONE
[1:45:55] <%linSP> STATE SWAP
[1:45:56] <%BinaryFireball> the clock is gonna be lit
[1:45:56] <+LynbellDaYo> this is so cool
[1:45:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh this is going to be great!
[1:45:57] <Parapattern> More stuff should be made of dogs
[1:45:59] <%machshop> subjective is the otherworld
[1:46:01] <dapperdoop> oh no
[1:46:04] <%Piemen99> Oh this is about to be wild
[1:46:05] <%ChestMimik> This is "Animations forced to 60fps but on crimes" the game
[1:46:05] <Vaun0x> HERE WE GOOOO
[1:46:06] <$OddballEA> why does Evee sound like Cortana
[1:46:06] <+StrawberryPantsu> Is this Ai: The Somnium Files?
[1:46:06] <sexdrugsvideogames> is this mesh shaders?
[1:46:06] <shinichizio> Could be a filtering error.
[1:46:08] <Ipsenscastle> brace for creepiness
[1:46:08] <+D00msDayDan> i look forward to seeing how this game gets fucked up
[1:46:10] <guiltyboya> ENTER THE SUBJECTIVE HELLHOLE

[1:46:35] <boomstickery> don't teach it to flirt
[1:46:35] <dots4eyes> It begins....
[1:46:36] <Ipsenscastle> SILENT HILLLL
[1:46:38] <guiltyboya> ARE YOU HITTING ON THE AI?!
[1:46:38] <dukenux> flirting with the AI
[1:46:39] <%ChestMimik> Why is he flirting with the ebil AI
[1:46:41] <chambatron> Next bit pls

[1:46:42] <dapperdoop> hmm...
[1:46:43] <%Pappajimbo> dont flirt with the robot
[1:46:44] <+Fenrein> he's totally flirting with it
[1:46:45] <thelonechris> Don't fuck the computer
[1:46:47] <yourliteraldog> Or she was experiencing neurological problems. Clocks and stuff are hard to recognize in altered states
[1:46:49] <+thickshield> that sounded like a wink to me
[1:46:49] <%linSP> bugged sure
[1:46:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Does it belong to Jacob?
[1:46:52] <dukenux> Jacob's Ladder
[1:46:55] <Parapattern> Escape?
[1:46:57] <%cvp5127> uh oh
[1:46:59] <%Chimeraelite> wouldn't you flirt with a sexy voice ai in your head?
[1:47:05] <%ChestMimik> I'm pretty sure "don't flirt with evil AI" was the lesson from Ex Machina.
[1:47:08] <RealPT1> is pat flexing his psych schooling?
[1:47:13] <%ChestMimik> I didn't learn it but everyone else should
[1:47:14] <$dalmek> is the room smaller? It looked smaller?
[1:47:20] <%Typhaeon> Deep Dream but 3D based on a brain scan
[1:47:21] <+rottingpastry> painting is cool
[1:47:22] <ZE_Count> Are we going to encounter the grim reaper or something.
[1:47:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> I legitimately cannot tell how they're making this visual effect.
[1:47:25] <%BinaryFireball> is this a vr game?
[1:47:25] <%PrimalDweeb> That's cuz we're all just big kids... right?
[1:47:25] <godzookylives> Wait is this the voice of Raiden and Old Joseph?
[1:47:26] <treehouse63> @Chimeraelite abso fuckin loutely
[1:47:30] <+Yakobro> @ChestMimik don't kinkshame 😠
[1:47:31] <Ipsenscastle> this is unsettling in a whole new way
[1:47:33] <+ImTrin> pat didnt gave chat their meds
[1:47:38] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> she must have stared at it a lot
[1:47:41] <yourliteraldog> No feeling attached to it
[1:47:41] <$joylent_blue> godzookylives richard epcar yes
[1:47:42] <%Meekest> This is like DIY Silent Hill hell zone
[1:47:42] <boomstickery> if i knew my AI for investigating murders learnt from everythign I'd be pretty fucking professional
[1:47:42] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, got disappointed at paintings as soon as you did this
[1:47:44] <+tigerfang86> oh
[1:47:44] <SaltyAzteca> Is that clock chiming in reverse?
[1:47:47] <%s1rcuit> might be her experiencing an event that makes her feel small and/or powerless like a child
[1:47:51] <%linSP> DEMON
[1:47:52] <dapperdoop> I bet the AI drew that
[1:47:54] <guiltyboya> @Chimeraelite I would for a time, and then I'd crave human interaction instead LUL

[2:10:29] <dapperdoop> technology bad
[2:10:38] <%Typhaeon> So, researchers are well-intentioned, tech companies seem to want to use them for nefarious ends, seems pretty standard
[2:10:40] <+Yakobro> im throwing up already
[2:10:45] <CrimsonGargoyle> jesus this is 2real LUL
[2:10:48] <%ChestMimik> This journalist sounds less objective than I've been all night

[2:10:51] <%transporterthesequel> That's...not cryptic at all.
[2:10:51] <%croxeye> thats our MC looooooooool

[2:11:07] <SaltyAzteca> FOOLS. PLAYING GOD.
[2:11:08] <reddpop_> next bit
[2:11:11] <+RowenCleric> uh huh
[2:11:13] <%ChestMimik> THATS A FUKKIN EVIL SENTENCE
[2:11:15] <annearkie> makes sense to me! :)
[2:11:28] <%transporterthesequel> He does though!
[2:11:31] <%rdark_ksu> yup but fortune favors the bold so fuck with all that shit
[2:11:35] <+tigerfang86> "Dont fuck with literal absurd futurist shit"
[2:11:38] <+Infeirno23> it poetic but it kinda makes sense
[2:11:42] <%heartlesshealer> .....
[2:11:43] <%Typhaeon> Thankfully this isn't making a dumb "playing god" argument that could just as easily be extended to modern medicine and sanitation

[2:12:18] <$AgentZombieMan> *natural order
[2:12:19] <DashXero> This scientist should be eliminated.
[2:12:21] <annearkie> oh god, nothing is more dangerous than scientists and engineers that think their opinions are objective facts
[2:12:21] <+Infeirno23> @laserbeaming complaining about optional content tomatoReally
[2:12:22] <BliVru> this makes me want to watch Inception again
[2:12:30] <%heartlesshealer> Sometimes finding nothing is the big thing because it erases the idea of something
[2:12:36] <%ChestMimik> Cryptic poet vs. shifty tech bro
[2:12:39] <%AncelDeLambert> @Piemono who even finds their computer to write while on acid?
[2:12:39] <+StooEsq> @Piemono Hunter S. Thompson
[2:12:45] <%Typhaeon> I don't mind lengthy exposition in games if it's interesting. This is interesting, unlike Amnesia's
[2:12:53] <Oxybe> So i just jumped in and... is Pat listening to an ingame podcast?
[2:13:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> MULEs
[2:13:04] <$AgentZombieMan> This is. The most thrilling video game. I have ever seen.

[2:13:26] <MyNameIsRasus> An ingame Joe Rogan roast
[2:13:27] <UndeadManatee> no wonder things are going so wrong in this setting, the only opposition is one stoned guy who wants to return to monke
[2:13:28] <annearkie> okay this is GREAT tho
[2:13:28] <shinichizio> "Are you evil?" "Citation needed!"

[2:14:10] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt Is this basically Evil Within Origins? Because all this memory, brain tech reminds me of Evil Within
[2:14:10] <+Yakobro> eeeeh
[2:14:13] <+Shacklebox> YES THEY ARE
[2:14:14] <%ChestMimik> Hey these seem to be really subjective arguments that don't adress the cryptic poem at all
[2:14:14] <%PrimalDweeb> Yep

[2:14:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> TECHNOLOGY WILL GET KIDS OFF PHONES
[2:14:37] <%Chimeraelite> I mean considering people ignore Nuclear power when it might be a solution isn't tech's problem,
[2:14:37] <ivanmistwalker> SUUUUUS AS FUCK
[2:14:42] <%machshop> "you don't need the politics, trust the corporation"
[2:14:42] <+tigerfang86> wqhat if we made MORE COMPUTERS
[2:14:43] <Oxybe> @BliVru Now we only need Pat to VTuber himself into a giant Saints Row 4 toilet and we will have reached peak Twitch
[2:14:43] <$AgentZombieMan> Kinda like government!
[2:14:50] <%Typhaeon> Global Warning exists because technology has been stunted by vested interests in old, dirty industry
[2:14:55] <%ChestMimik> TECHNOLOGY WILL STOP THE ROBOT UPRISING BY TURNING US INTO ROBOTS
[2:14:56] <Parapattern> I know! We'll dig our way out!
[2:14:58] <+CatastropheCorvid> not just tech, but human nature
[2:14:59] <%luftraumm1> sociological interpretations would point to the fact that the source of those problems is Kapital
[2:14:59] <%AncelDeLambert> install the calculator DIRECTLY INTO MY HEAD, PLEASE!
[2:14:59] <%rdark_ksu> ok and he lost me
[2:14:59] <%Typhaeon> warming*
[2:15:00] <HotMafia81> Technology will fix what it broke, won't you, technology?
[2:15:06] <DashXero> TOOLS CAN BE TAKEN AWAY
[2:15:06] <%Ne1son> Naw I heard Thomas Edison was a witch
[2:15:07] <%Broand> BRAIN IMPLANTS?
[2:15:07] <+A0N33> So... What technology are they talking about? Putting AIs in side our brain?
[2:15:09] <%barrakuta371> Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions!
[2:15:10] <annearkie> not all advances are good, my dude!!!
[2:15:14] <%ChestMimik> How is this guy still going
[2:15:14] <%AncelDeLambert> @Typhaeon bing bing bing! (also pointless ludism)
[2:15:16] <MyNameIsRasus> Remember guys: don't use brain implants
[2:15:16] <DublinRage> Styx "Mr Roboto" was trying to warn us about this
[2:15:17] <Gallhint> youd be surprised, pat
[2:15:19] <%heartlesshealer> BUT TOOLS ARE ALSO PARTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND SHAPE YOU
[2:15:20] <%Broand> It's brain implants
[2:15:21] <annearkie> oh NO
[2:15:22] <ThDark> You'd be surprised, Pat
[2:15:22] <Gallhint> wheels are evil
[2:15:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> ... Actually Pat there were people who were against writing because it meant people would have to remember less.
[2:15:23] <%BinaryFireball> AH SHIT THE WHEEL GET THE SPEAR JIMMY
[2:15:25] <AMDBR9S> to alcohol the cause of and solution to all of life's problems
[2:15:26] <+dks_junkie> Pat, they totally fucking did.
[2:15:27] <Gieron667> aint global warming caused by technology specifically, mostly cars
[2:15:28] <absentking> THATS ABSOLUTELY DID PAT
[2:15:33] <%watchmanfury> plug in to the digital future maaaaan
[2:15:33] <%AncelDeLambert> PLUG ME IN!
[2:15:34] <%transporterthesequel> Oh FUCK THAT
[2:15:34] <donkymagooterson> it's a weird dilemma - I doubt people will suddenly decide to throw away the technology that already exists, so what is the solution?
[2:15:35] <+lazysaiyajin> oh boy anti vax
[2:15:35] <%AncelDeLambert> RIGHT NOW!
[2:15:35] <Manwad> fuck all that
[2:15:36] <%MrBleeeh> its just elon musk talk
[2:15:37] <%PrimalDweeb> Do you have a filter on Pat?
[2:15:39] <%DappercatEsquire> this is like psychological/mental transhumanism
[2:15:39] <absentking> I WOULD DO IT
[2:15:41] <%LoneFonte> what about "holy shit, fire, RUN!"
[2:15:43] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat that absolutely did happen

[2:15:48] <%sleepers1mulant> Fuck this
[2:15:49] <%LiquidDinosaur> same
[2:15:49] <+griffball13> just put an ai in your brain it's fine
[2:15:50] <%ChestMimik> AI can't recognize a fucking bus I don't want it being used in my BRAIN
[2:15:51] <%DianaTheAscian> thats a lie
[2:15:51] <gustavozxd> solve old problems, invent new ones
[2:15:55] <@commanderclaw> If it solved my mental disorders I'd try it
[2:15:55] <%luftraumm1> Elon musk's brain node shit
[2:15:57] <%weissguard> MrDestructoid I will save that which I destroyed, beeb boop MrDestructoid
[2:15:58] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The problem with innovation and efficiency is that the more efficient we make shit the more of it we use which either negates the environmental benefits or makes it WORSE
[2:16:00] <Make_me_mad> They want to overclock your brain. It's the shit your AI lady was talking about, a short boost of processing power; I bet they stole it from you.
[2:16:00] <%rdark_ksu> like the chastity belt that was connected to the net but in your brain? no gosh dang thanks man
[2:16:01] <Manwad> motherfuckers figured out how to hack pacemakers AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PATCHED YET
[2:16:01] <monkeyonsticks> Get that elon musk chip right in your brain
[2:16:03] <BliVru> holy shit this audio file is bigger than this game
[2:16:04] <%Laecerelius> Fucking technoheresy!!!!
[2:16:05] <%heartlesshealer> It WILL change how you socialize dumbass

[2:16:31] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt I wonder if Chernobyl tainted people's opinion on nuclear power.
[2:16:33] <UndeadManatee> its not like theres a history of screwing with brains going wrong or anything, the lobotomobile never happened
[2:16:34] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The problem with innovation and efficiency is that the more efficient we make shit the more of it we use which either negates the environmental benefits or makes it WORSE
[2:16:34] <DashXero> Ted needs to go.
[2:16:36] <+MihriChan> Anyway turn me into a robot already

[2:20:29] <Saltmeisterr> despite the numerous text errors, the writing in this game is very gud
[2:20:33] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> spicy weiner
[2:20:33] <MyNameIsRasus> how come the last memory before she dies is so far from the end of that line
[2:20:38] <dapperdoop> is this gonna go back to baby
[2:20:45] <+Infeirno23> i guess if the dream is vivid enough you would have memories of it
[2:20:54] <UndeadManatee> @ChestMimik it was real, dude invented the ice pick lobotomy
[2:20:54] <%LiquidDinosaur> DEATH IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
[2:21:10] <restingbones> God it seems they didnt change the interface for this. This gets really obtuse later on.
[2:21:13] <%s1rcuit> this can only go well
[2:21:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> @BigHugs Absolutely is.
[2:21:21] <+tigerfang86> oh boy

[2:22:12] <Badgerconda_> this whole game is a texture nightmare, wtf
[2:22:14] <MyNameIsRasus> this house looks comfy
[2:22:19] <%machshop> cookies for dinner!
[2:22:20] <%PrimalDweeb> Nightmare kitchen.
[2:22:22] <Louie_Salmon> This is an extremely unique look
[2:22:24] <%Typhaeon> I swear I thought the in-game lady said "Gief" there
[2:22:24] <donkymagooterson> if the game can keep this up for the duration it's going to be a masterpiece
[2:22:24] <shinichizio> Homemade cookies.
[2:22:25] <BliVru> holy shit i lived in a place like this
[2:22:27] <dapperdoop> eat one
[2:22:29] <%QueequegTheater> Man, this might be the most accurate depiction of half-remembering a childhood house I've ever seen
[2:22:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Let's do the Timewarp again.
[2:22:30] <%Cozy90> homemade cookies
[2:22:31] <%PrimalDweeb> In more ways then one.
[2:22:35] <KoryMccool> this is a terrifying effectg
[2:22:38] <%templar010> I assume this is a representation of how 'memory' looks to us
[2:22:39] <$sniffy77> I like the weird texture look
[2:22:39] <+Infeirno23> thats a pretty cool way of showing the generationm\

[2:22:46] <+tigerfang86> DOOM WALL
[2:22:50] <marvel877> This looks like how a Kinect viewed the room it was recording.
[2:22:55] <%afronooch> is that like a firewall
[2:22:55] <%MechArch> is this spooky google maps?
[2:22:56] <BliVru> The mystery is that she saw her parents trying ear sex
[2:22:57] <%CalderGaming> it's like Google Maps for memory
[2:22:58] <Tuna_Can_0> when did google maps go into peoples homes?
[2:22:58] <+tigerfang86> uhhhhh

[2:23:22] <%sleepers1mulant> God I wonder how they did this effect
[2:23:24] <+Infeirno23> @templar010 i think its more the AI trying to fill in the holes for the generated memoryscape
[2:23:26] <%BinaryFireball> That wizard is from something real me thinks
[2:23:27] <%Agami23> toy dinobot
[2:23:30] <annearkie> it's like an AI tried to do a watercolor painting

[2:24:03] <HotMafia81> Whole game's been scrombled
[2:24:05] <%Dementedpenguin> Happy Halloween Kappa
[2:24:06] <%luftraumm1> you're going backwards
[2:24:06] <SaltyAzteca> The phone rang
[2:24:07] <Make_me_mad> One of those is going to come after you on its own later moving like that and it's gonna be the worst
[2:24:08] <+AbnormalVoid> peace out
[2:24:10] <%heartlesshealer> pizza?
[2:24:20] <SaltyAzteca> OR a phone call
[2:24:21] <zettig> It's like someone took that one MLB graphics glitch and made a gameplay mechanic out of it.

[2:24:47] <vermillionzetta> I feel like I've heard this VA before
[2:24:50] <%QueequegTheater> the control is near the door
[2:24:50] <KoryMccool> i left for a second and now im scared
[2:24:54] <HotMafia81> Yaknow, from an asset creation standpoint this game is genius. The bulk of the assets are just fucked up photoscans
[2:24:54] <BeagleCypher> Let's do a timewarp again
[2:24:56] <%Cozy90> A TIMEWARp
[2:24:57] <%LiquidDinosaur> I'm glad this game isnt triggering my phobia of DeepDream procgen image shit
[2:24:58] <%luftraumm1> is this a play on "le Stade du mirroir"?
[2:25:01] <DashXero> This is a mind frag.
[2:25:04] <+tigerfang86> OH NO
[2:25:04] <Make_me_mad> My theory is that this whole game is someone using a way more advanced version of this tech to look at your memories of this case and that's why all modern mirrors are broken; instead of just being scrambled it 'patches' them out by breaking them.
[2:25:04] <reddpop_> get him on the phone and go subjective?
[2:25:06] <%QueequegTheater> a time warp
[2:25:08] <Manwad> uh oh
[2:25:08] <$dalmek> everything looks okay out of the corner of my eye
[2:25:09] <BoSteed> I can see this getting really goddamn terrifying very quickly.

[2:36:19] <%twoto858> Some of the shots in this game look uncomfortably realistic

[2:36:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> what is this black stuff
[2:36:40] <Parapattern> I keep thinking Paige's voice is part of the game
[2:36:42] <jorniev> the game is called the signifier
[2:36:49] <%toastybites> THE TRAUMA MEMORIES
[2:36:52] <MyNameIsRasus> I mean...

[2:37:34] <+dks_junkie> I DONT LIKE THAT AT FUCKING ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[2:37:34] <SaltyAzteca> Perspective
[2:37:34] <%CalderGaming> this game is awesome
[2:37:35] <%YakumoYomi> The Oculus of Rehabilitation
[2:37:35] <%Ranryu692> Is that Nicolas Cage?
[2:37:42] <wannabemoogle> fuck that
[2:37:43] <SaltyAzteca> He wants out
[2:37:44] <thelonechris> I absolutely hate it
[2:37:44] <+griffball13> @PatStaresAt the dad could be big becasue she was a child at the time
[2:37:44] <%ChestMimik> NOPE NOPE NOPE
[2:37:45] <%LiquidDinosaur> wow we're really big to dogs...it's weird
[2:37:51] <ancrest_tant> Because to a dog he is gigantic
[2:37:53] <$OddballEA> its giant dad
[2:37:58] <+tigerfang86> Larege Dad returns
[2:38:03] <%s1rcuit> what if the dog can only go to the dark place because it got put down there or something
[2:38:14] <%honeyman18> Unpacking this would be a nightmare
[2:38:16] <vermillionzetta> This seems like it'd be extremely disorienting in VR
[2:38:25] <%MrBleeeh> perhap
[2:38:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> I really hope this isn't going where I think it's going.
[2:38:33] <Manwad> was home broken?
[2:38:35] <%YakumoYomi> Dad's either an abuser, a pedo, or both
[2:38:39] <%heartlesshealer> deep south
[2:38:43] <%BLK_HRLQN_13> Im calling SUS
[2:38:47] <%toastybites> how is the main character not pissing himself right now
[2:38:48] <%Treuan> This is kind of creepy
[2:38:52] <%ChestMimik> This whole situation is evil even without Shou Tucker's Artificial Intelligence
[2:38:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> @YakumoYomi I'm pretty sure being a pedo makes you a de-facto abuser.
[2:38:59] <vermillionzetta> Also, I actually DID recognize the narrator's voice from somewhere. It's the same guy that does Proventus in Skyrim.
[2:39:02] <%honeyman18> drawing in the cabinet
[2:39:05] <%LiquidDinosaur> @toastybites he just has the urge to piss on things he owns
[2:39:05] <restingbones> This is where you came from
[2:39:08] <DashXero> This is supposed to be a happy memory?!
[2:39:10] <%s1rcuit> @YakumoYomi or something involving involving a 3rd party happened
[2:39:12] <Joem1k> What's Zangief chewing on?
[2:39:13] <vermillionzetta> useless knowledge but
[2:39:14] <Make_me_mad> The dog can enter the black zones; maybe you gotta check that out as the dog.
[2:39:15] <vermillionzetta> yeah
[2:39:21] <restingbones> Go be the dog again
[2:39:25] <%Reveresao> Mr.StaresAt I want to go home now.........
[2:39:27] <%DianaTheAscian> 4!?
[2:39:34] <%rdark_ksu> Pat you know nothing good can happen to a little girl in any form of media. It must always be tragedy since like Electra in ancient Greece
[2:39:34] <ManfredA> I'm like 99% he's Batou from GitS
[2:39:38] <+Izzzyko> 10 bucks this is gonna end up being some cild abuse nonsense
[2:39:41] <donkymagooterson> there's something bad about that dad
[2:39:57] <%heartlesshealer> @DashXero People fabricate happy memories to cover up other things.
[2:40:01] <%transporterthesequel> Yeah Huge dad seems about right
[2:40:18] <%LiquidDinosaur> GIANTDAD IS CANCELLED
[2:40:24] <SaltyAzteca> Breakthrough, leaving the apartment?
[2:40:30] <+Yakobro> doggo
[2:40:31] <ManfredA> I'm afraid it's a very painful kind of abuse
[2:40:32] <%ChestMimik> Aw
[2:40:33] <%heartlesshealer> leaving the house is light and hope
[2:40:37] <vermillionzetta> Toxic parents inflate themselves while trying to shrink their kids
[2:40:41] <Manwad> was dog fake?
[2:40:41] <%transporterthesequel> So they totally didn't get her a puppy
[2:40:44] <%bassoontyphoon> I really dont like that the bed is lit up, it feels like they want to highlight something that happned there.....
[2:40:44] <+LynbellDaYo> pupper in a box
[2:40:46] <+xmetalicdemonx> God I'm dumb, I have no idea what's going on.
[2:40:47] <UndeadManatee> so its a brain dog?
[2:40:47] <%s1rcuit> I'm calling it now, dad killed puppy
[2:40:49] <%Reveresao> the kid won't listen, i have NO choice but to beat her - Dad
[2:40:49] <%ChestMimik> I can't wait for this to be horrifying again
[2:40:52] <vermillionzetta> Keep them in a child ego state that's easier to control
[2:40:53] <%MechArch> does dad like to be.. big spoon?!
[2:40:55] <%luftraumm1> I don't know about that, but this IS a video game, actual stuff usually isn't so cut and dry
[2:40:57] <+LynbellDaYo> dog was prob fake
[2:40:57] <+Kojixif> pupper and kid, im already crying
[2:40:58] <mattymcfilth> subjective seems to be what she wished her home life was
[2:41:02] <DashXero> @heartlesshealer Hm. I suppose that makes sense.
[2:41:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ChestMimik It's horrifying NOW!
[2:41:05] <+griffball13> maybe the dog was a doll or stuffed toy
[2:41:10] <%heartlesshealer> oh no, is dog pregnancy?
[2:41:13] <Parapattern> I think it's what she wishes her parents would get her
[2:41:21] <ancrest_tant> Maybe she wishes she was bigger
[2:41:27] <donkymagooterson> although it does not exist in objective memory
[2:41:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @heartlesshealer Oh fuck god now shit dammit I hope you are wrong.
[2:41:39] <%ChestMimik> She had a picture of a dog in the future memory so I'm pretty sure the dog is real
[2:41:48] <mattymcfilth> @Parapattern im with you on that
[2:41:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Perhaps go back to first memory since you can do dog now?
[2:42:01] <ptmpopulatethemoon> So what I'm gathering isnt that he isnt directly inside the person's mind like in that one game, but he's using a computer to predict what was happening?
[2:42:17] <shinichizio> Yeah this a corpse brainscan
[2:42:20] <reddpop_> did you take the dog in to the dark zone?
[2:42:20] <%ChestMimik> Great even the objective memories are subjective
[2:42:21] <vermillionzetta> The fact that this feels familiar to me is precisely why I'm getting bad vibes
[2:42:23] <DashXero> Hm... This took place over the course of 60 days, right?
[2:42:23] <%Typhaeon> It's from a brain scan basically
[2:42:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> OHHH he's doing like a mentat logical progression
[2:42:31] <silentblast93> ok what is ths creepy game
[2:42:33] <%Broand> They're reproducing the memory with AI
[2:42:34] <%heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks Father model became huge mouth and mouth tunnel was girl's bedroom and spider things look like hands and bedtime story hands are placed ominously for a still image
[2:42:36] <Manwad> objectivly subjective
[2:42:38] <%s1rcuit> @ptmpopulatethemoon as good an explanation as any
[2:42:40] <$dalmek> it's an AI recreation of stored memories
[2:42:43] <Make_me_mad> @ptmpopulatethemoon It's machine learning AI trying to recreate memories, with him going in to interpret the results.
[2:42:46] <%machshop> peesa
[2:42:48] <%heartlesshealer> @CommanderSqueaks I also hope I am wrong
[2:42:51] <Parapattern> Pizza Time
[2:42:55] <%toastybites> sounds like lyrics to a Hotline Miami song
[2:43:01] <SaltyAzteca> "Im starving im ordering a pizza"?
[2:43:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> THIS GAME'S GRAPHICS ARE SO FUCKING WEIRD
[2:43:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Subjective memory, become as dog and go into black tunnel?
[2:43:28] <silentblast93> this game looks fucking vroken
[2:43:31] <%BinaryFireball> dino = dog?
[2:43:37] <restingbones> Only Dog may enter black wall
[2:43:45] <%Jekado> this is a bibeo bame!
[2:43:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> ... OH NO
[2:43:47] <donkymagooterson> these memories take place over 60 days?
[2:43:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIG SPOON
[2:43:50] <Thalchampz> SPOON
[2:43:51] <%BinaryFireball> dad spoon?
[2:43:52] <SoySocks> spooning
[2:43:52] <%machshop> the big spoon monkaS
[2:43:52] <reonome> there is no spoon
[2:43:52] <vermillionzetta> @PatStaresAt if you like this game, maybe you would like games by YAMES
[2:43:53] <%toastybites> maybe Dad smart
[2:43:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> I DON'T LIKE
[2:43:55] <Goodvibes99508> I'm amazed by the amount of level they are getting off of so few assets
[2:43:55] <ancrest_tant> Dog is subjective
[2:43:55] <%scrumbotime> .....Spooning?
[2:43:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> is.... is this Loss?
[2:43:56] <Thalchampz> is it The Tick?
[2:43:57] <%Treuan> spoon is too big
[2:43:57] <%toastybites> feeding her knowlege
[2:43:58] <Manwad> it seems you can see where you might need to go via how many of those unlocks you have per scene
[2:43:58] <%BinaryFireball> yes big spoon
[2:43:59] <laserbeaming> BIG SPOON
[2:44:00] <CoffeeShopA> Is the dog an imaginary friend?
[2:44:01] <%s1rcuit> spoon feeding?
[2:44:03] <%rdark_ksu> she ate her dad!
[2:44:05] <KaiserMario> Eating books
[2:44:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> BIG SPOON
[2:44:07] <%MechArch> big dad spoon
[2:44:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> BAD TIME
[2:44:08] <chaos2frozen> spoon, maybe the person who feeds her?
[2:44:08] <+archangel9889> spoon used for doing meth?
[2:44:09] <silentblast93> pat is the big spoon
[2:44:09] <+AbnormalVoid> then who was spoon?
[2:44:10] <Vaun0x> Only wolf link may enter the twilight wall
[2:44:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> spoon for beating?
[2:44:12] <%bhp_99> get hit with spoon?
[2:44:13] <Make_me_mad> Dad bed spoon books bedtime story? This is a real bad combo.
[2:44:14] <%Typhaeon> Can you possess that dog
[2:44:15] <%ChestMimik> I want to know what that headcrab is but also have no desire to see it again
[2:44:17] <%Jekado> i keep thinking head crab everytime i see that thing
[2:44:22] <mattymcfilth> born with a silver spoon? or she was spoon fed growing up
[2:44:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> I hope it was for meth
[2:44:36] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Dad is spoon
[2:44:42] <%Doruben> dad is spoon
[2:44:43] <Setaro> Her dad was the big spoon?!
[2:44:44] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> provider of food?
[2:44:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I doubt silver spoon, this looks like a deciedly middle-class household.
[2:44:47] <+LynbellDaYo> if the dog is drawing, was it a little sibling
[2:44:47] <Setaro> wee woo
[2:44:49] <Manwad> starved?
[2:44:50] <silentblast93> ok what appartment lets you have pets
[2:44:52] <UndeadManatee> i think the spoon is hunger
[2:44:52] <%devanmuse> don't think you fully explored the black room as the dog in event 2
[2:44:57] <shinichizio> This kitchen is tiny as shit
[2:44:59] <%heartlesshealer> a spoon is a tool for eating, dad is mouth, spoon on bed
[2:45:00] <restingbones> Then who was Phone?
[2:45:05] <$OddballEA> big dad=big spoon
[2:45:05] <ancrest_tant> Mom, dad, and dog?
[2:45:12] <KoryMccool> isnt it that hes hungry for knowledge since the spoons near books?
[2:45:20] <%heartlesshealer> I want to stop thinking, hope Pat solves this
[2:45:20] <BliVru> Maybe a spider killed her dog
[2:45:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> food provider. She hungey
[2:45:35] <reddpop_> can you get through the unpassable space with the dog? he mentioned it could
[2:45:40] <%heartlesshealer> spider made of fingers
[2:45:41] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> Spoon is sleepy.
[2:45:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> You cannot become a dog in subjective memory 1?
[2:45:44] <%machshop> parents dancing to stars of the lid i guess
[2:45:51] <%Doruben> it doesnt like when you look?
[2:45:54] <%heartlesshealer> bed prominent

[2:48:29] <%luftraumm1> dad is in mourning for dead son?
[2:48:30] <vermillionzetta> Could the spoon be a metaphor for Heroin?
[2:48:32] <%ElkRiverDog> Trophy?
[2:48:34] <+Cpt_Randybeard> Maybe the real spoon were the friends we made along the way?
[2:48:34] <+dks_junkie> pls tell me the spoon isnt about to be a kid's interpretation of heroin abuse
[2:48:42] <+dks_junkie> or some shit
[2:48:42] <%rdark_ksu> no spoons only sporks in this household
[2:48:50] <%luftraumm1> na spoon and heroin is too obvious
[2:48:53] <reonome> oh god that is horrifying
[2:48:53] <KoryMccool> that is jarring af
[2:48:54] <vermillionzetta> That's the vibe I'm getting man
[2:48:57] <Vaun0x> spoop
[2:49:01] <%LiquidDinosaur> @dks_junkie wait lemme think is there any other symbolism?
[2:49:01] <Make_me_mad> I think it was in memory 1.
[2:49:04] <+dks_junkie> @vermillionzetta BRUH WE HAD THE SAME IDEA AT THE SAME TIME
[2:49:05] <+dks_junkie> LOL
[2:49:08] <%Broand> Try it in the first memory?
[2:49:10] <restingbones> Its there yes, but its it that version of there?
[2:49:11] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> maybe where the phone is?
[2:49:12] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Boy someone forgot to tighten up the graphics on level 3
[2:49:14] <@SoFarFetched> COUCH SPOON
[2:49:20] <+dks_junkie> it was orbiting the parents
[2:49:21] <%heartlesshealer> the model is also dad walking, so hallway?
[2:49:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> OH GOD IS THAT TABLE AN OBJECT OR A FLOOR TESXTURE?
[2:49:30] <vermillionzetta> It'd make sense that a tweaker dad would be abusive
[2:49:31] <%LiquidDinosaur> IS THIS GAME 3D OR 2D
[2:49:34] <%Jekado> did you guys see that giant spoon?
[2:49:34] <BliVru> My sibling tried to eat pizza with a spoon so I killed them
[2:49:37] <%Piemen99> there was a spoon on the crouch on the last memory
[2:49:37] <Vaun0x> yes.

[2:50:12] <Sheepeze> So this game is just moody blues
[2:50:25] <KoryMccool> this is some legit horror right here
[2:50:28] <%Ranryu692> pretty much
[2:50:35] <+dks_junkie> and checking out the real place could give you the data for obj states 2 and 4
[2:50:35] <+tigerfang86> Hell Dog
[2:50:37] <+sixcubit> just showed up and this is a hell of a ride

[2:50:46] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> better game than Amnesia: Rebirth
[2:50:48] <restingbones> The game is a bit annoying about this, I will save you some time. You can't find everything here yet.
[2:50:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @rdark_ksu i'm legitimately upset that pineapple seems to be gaining mainstream acceptance as a topping.

[2:51:45] <+tigerfang86> Dad is Big Dad
[2:51:46] <%transporterthesequel> Mom being spoon would make sense.

[3:06:47] <%Typhaeon> This game is under $20 on Steam right now FYI
[3:06:48] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Havictos That's why it's sus.
[3:06:53] <$dalmek> I'm loving this
[3:06:54] <%AncelDeLambert> fucking American McGee shit going on here
[3:06:56] <%Typhaeon> That seems criminally low
[3:06:57] <%ChestMimik> @Havictos We don't actually know
[3:07:02] <$Caped_Eggy> SNAKE EATER
[3:07:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> everyone buy this fucking game and yell at your friends to buy it too
[3:07:05] <%Cozy90> :O
[3:07:06] <%luftraumm1> that FEELS like a dream
[3:07:07] <%MrBleeeh> this game is fucking sick
[3:07:08] <DashXero> Boulevard of Broken Dreams?!
[3:07:09] <%Piemen99> court house?
[3:07:10] <Zombrocom> Howd we get to The Throne of Want
[3:07:14] <+Kitafin> stairs
[3:07:25] <+rottingpastry> I mean, faster is better, but he's just lying about "BUT THE TIME"
[3:07:27] <DashXero> Yo, that diner! It's like that painting.
[3:07:28] <$dalmek> this feels like a nightmare Eiffel 65 music video
[3:07:28] <%heartlesshealer> perspective stairs?
[3:07:29] <ptmpopulatethemoon> where the city sleeps
[3:07:31] <Make_me_mad> @Havictos The lady was part of an important company or something and I think a legal thing was going down? I feel like they mentioned that near the start.
[3:07:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, in real life, couldn't the police investigator just contact the provider for the email and go "Hey, this woman is dead and we're investigating her death, can you give us access to her email?"
[3:07:41] <ptmpopulatethemoon> but its home to me and I walk alone
[3:07:44] <+rottingpastry> If you don't tell us soon, we'll just bash in random numbers and get locked out
[3:08:01] <theroomman2> this game looks amazing so far. Feels like observer but you actually play with the mind concepts, it's not just some vfx mindfuck.
[3:08:04] <%ChestMimik> @CommanderSqueaks I think they open the game mentioning that this isn't really legal to begin with so something is up
[3:08:04] <%BinaryFireball> probably manequins
[3:08:05] <+rottingpastry> @CommanderSqueaks That's why the mc has an issue with him asking for the password. There's a legal channel for this.
[3:08:06] <%AncelDeLambert> it'd be nice to have some context. "We have her in for questioning, but we have to release her at some point, so get it done before then"
[3:08:06] <Goodvibes99508> form the steps by perspective
[3:08:07] <%bassoontyphoon> is this a simulacra?
[3:08:11] <BliVru> What if Persona 6 was like this?
[3:08:12] <%luftraumm1> those are stairs
[3:08:22] <reddpop_> SHADOW PUZZLES
[3:08:26] <%BinaryFireball> this is some senua shit
[3:08:36] <%bassoontyphoon> SHADOW PUZZLES
[3:08:39] <+rottingpastry> let paige do it
[3:08:40] <KoryMccool> ...
[3:08:42] <MyNameIsRasus> @CommanderSqueaks depends which country they're in
[3:08:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ChestMimik I think @rottingpastry had the point. There's legal red tape Tom doesn't want to have to deal with, so he wants to just know the password.
[3:08:42] <+tigerfang86> actual nightmare shadow puzzles
[3:08:44] <%PrimalDweeb> Maybe you can climb them?
[3:08:47] <%luftraumm1> anamorphic images fucking cool
[3:09:01] <%chiazam> advanced shadow puzzles
[3:09:15] <%Cozy90> this is like that episode of TNG where geordi has to figure out who the shadow guy is
[3:09:16] <+Infeirno23> god of war 4 puzzle
[3:09:21] <+Infeirno23> oops i meant 3
[3:09:24] <+rottingpastry> Something pat has never said before in his life
[3:09:29] <%emperordread> the more this messed up sequence goes on, the more I want someone to shout "PERSONA!"
[3:09:36] <%ChestMimik> @CommanderSqueaks I also think Evee is a human brain stuffed in a computer so I'm probably not being objective to Tom
[3:09:39] <%PrimalDweeb> Only 27%?!
[3:09:40] <BliVru> @PatStaresAt Imagine recreating wet dreams with this
[3:09:42] <+sixcubit> anor londo?
[3:09:43] <%heartlesshealer> how sky box?
[3:09:49] <%chiazam> woof
[3:09:58] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> why she on the edge of that roof?
[3:10:01] <ancrest_tant> It’s the blood moon
[3:10:03] <+rottingpastry> why sky box?
[3:10:11] <KoryMccool> think id be too freaked out to do this job
[3:10:18] <%bassoontyphoon> drop down
[3:10:24] <%Piemen99> trees?
[3:10:28] <%heartlesshealer> I was just curious because of tall structures
[3:10:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fact that Russel asked about the legal ramifications and Tom went "Naw, fuck that shit, just give me the password." is super sus.
[3:10:35] <%luftraumm1> persona is jungian mystical analytical psychology this is lacanian psychoanalysis
[3:11:13] <%MrBleeeh> uh oh
[3:11:14] <restingbones> Not ntended
[3:11:16] <thelonechris> This seems more like a game error
[3:11:18] <+rottingpastry> lol
[3:11:19] <+Yakobro> pat...
[3:11:19] <%ChestMimik> Game just lets you clip out of bounds thats amazing
[3:11:20] <+LynbellDaYo> it works
[3:11:22] <%heartlesshealer> umm
[3:11:22] <+rottingpastry> it's a dream it's all intended
[3:11:23] <%koolaid_kevster> wth did I tune into
[3:11:25] <%bassoontyphoon> the computer cant generate parts of the dream that arent there
[3:11:25] <+griffball13> it's a dream so it's fine
[3:11:26] <KoryMccool> oh my
[3:11:27] <%emperordread> No confidence
[3:11:28] <%luftraumm1> what do you know about dreams pat?
[3:11:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is it a glitch in the VIDEO GAME or is it a glitch in EVEE?

[3:17:13] <+Havictos> So from 5 minutes of research a big issue some people seem to have with this game is apparently you can lock yourself into a undesired ending and you won't know until down the line.
[3:17:14] <%ChestMimik> Don't like that
[3:17:15] <%BinaryFireball> thats how he got there so fast

[3:27:10] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> "and my shareholders"
[3:27:12] <MyNameIsRasus> "the problem is when the regulations stop me from making money"
[3:27:15] <%heartlesshealer> high potential of dark side technology with brain manipulation

[3:27:22] <+Izzzyko> i mean technically she's not wrong but she isn't right either
[3:27:22] <%ChestMimik> Regulations protect people like Russel from people like you Marie
[3:27:30] <donkymagooterson> true but that doesn't make you any less shitty
[3:27:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> This lady is that special kind of sus where she's not saying anything that's neccesarily wrong, but she's saying it in a way that absolutely makes me not trust her.
[3:27:32] <%juxtest> Its gonna come down to ideology and which one of us isn't going to be taken out of commission by a trip down the stairs

[3:28:24] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> "Now tell us about this password Tom wanted so bad."
[3:28:25] <%AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Yeah, I feel like we're just gonna get a big world shot, and the world is just Ashen Lake
[3:28:26] <%scrumbotime> I'd throw a dollar into the ring that the world is absolutely fucked and they want to make Give Up Machines

[3:32:32] <MyNameIsRasus> ....how far into the future is this?
[3:32:34] <%bassoontyphoon> THE NAME OF THAT PAINTING IS AUTOMAT
[3:32:36] <%cvp5127> cycle?
[3:32:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> So she LIKES you being skeptical.
[3:32:46] <KoryMccool> epcars voice is smooth as silk
[3:32:47] <%Jekado> fucking lady wants to make skynet
[3:32:51] <Parapattern> But not so carefully that we don't make tons and tons of money
[3:32:53] <+LynbellDaYo> I think I should dip 'cause now I really wanna play this game myself. Good night everyone, have a good rest of stream.
[3:32:54] <%Jekado> or is a skynet already
[3:32:56] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt is this just Binary Domain?
[3:32:59] <%DianaTheAscian> prob
[3:32:59] <dinnydanny777> Wait did she just say people have to be more selfish to stop loneliness limesHmm
[3:33:00] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, seems like it
[3:33:00] <%TheWinged7> GOAT
[3:33:01] <+tigerfang86> BECOME AS GODS
[3:33:02] <DashXero> Blow this place up.
[3:33:04] <%Agami23> a singularity?
[3:33:04] <+tigerfang86> BECOME ASGODS
[3:33:04] <%All_Salt> He said earlier that the AI messes up on glass so maybe that becomes a tell later?
[3:33:05] <%moogleboy1984> Mive Hind
[3:33:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Primitive" AI in the loosest sense of the word. She seems quite advanced to me.
[3:33:08] <$dalmek> that painting IS called Automat holy shit
[3:33:08] <%BinaryFireball> AI takeover
[3:33:09] <%rdark_ksu> miss I dont mean to be the bearer of bad news but..you dont bare at all
[3:33:09] <$ItsRatman> I'd say she's gone beyond primitive
[3:33:10] <%BinaryFireball> hot
[3:33:11] <MyNameIsRasus> THIS CANNOT CONTINUE
[3:33:11] <Teyaric> Or she's doing a "ESCAPE THIS ROTTING FLESH INTO ZE MATRIX" dealie that will inevitably go very Evil Within 2
[3:33:13] <Rei_Dsoto> Well, this is going to be horrifyingly existential
[3:33:14] <+lazysaiyajin> place go boom
[3:33:14] <%Ranryu692> just EMP the whole country. fuck it
[3:33:15] <%honeyman18> hey, dead space wasn't far off!
[3:33:16] <+Kitafin> punch the singularity
[3:33:16] <+dks_junkie> i just boought this
[3:33:16] <donkymagooterson> beautiful acknowledgement that you might destroy everything but are going to going to do it anyway
[3:33:19] <+sixcubit> would a singularity really be SO bad
[3:33:20] <%Piemen99> I-IS THE TOWER A SINGLE AMPLIFIER FOR AI
[3:33:20] <%s1rcuit> her desk looked a little jittery when Pat walked by it, don't know if it's a bug, a simulation, or me being paranoid
[3:33:21] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Primitive in the sense that it can't run the whole galaxy yet?
[3:33:21] <%rdark_ksu> tread i ment tread damnit all to hell
[3:33:21] <%juxtest> Gotta build the robot devil or someone else might beat us to it
[3:33:21] <+Infeirno23> her body is just a puppet to "speak" through probably
[3:33:22] <Visorak6> Its been three hours and I'm still not sure what this game is ACTUALLY about
[3:33:22] <%heartlesshealer> "So Pat played Transistor"
[3:33:26] <%Laecerelius> WE MUST PURGE THE ABOMINABLE INTELLIGENCE!

[3:36:38] <dinnydanny777> Are the names of the areas brain related?
[3:36:39] <+WackyGear> @PatStaresAt are they color-coded the same way as the game color codes objective and subjective memories?
[3:36:40] <%heartlesshealer> it's why we can second-guess shit and lots of other cool things and operate our entire bodies
[3:36:42] <BoneBagMel> yeah commercial is subjective and research is objective

[3:38:06] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah this feels like a two streams thing
[3:38:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> This game is 15% off on GOG.
[3:38:08] <+tigerfang86> SIGNIFIER IS MY REAL HOMIE
[3:38:10] <%Ranryu692> howlongtobeat says 4 hours

[3:38:21] <theroomman2> 4-5 hours
[3:38:22] <Xenioplate> wait shit, is this the end of the stream?
[3:38:23] <Rei_Dsoto> Looks interesting all around
[3:38:27] <%heartlesshealer> thanks for hosting tonight Pat. Good game! videoc1Paw
[3:38:31] <theroomman2> if you read everything 6-7
[3:38:31] <%Ranryu692> Streets of Kamurocho
[3:38:34] <%AlphaTauri> is there a sponsor link
[3:38:38] <Teyaric> yeah go pump money into these guys
[3:38:45] <donkymagooterson> thanks dirtbag
[3:38:45] <%honeyman18> maybe more
[3:38:52] <+notkojima> pat just a friendly heads up that twitch is cracking down on mentions of CAT BREEDING MILLS so please make sure neither you nor your chat mention the CAT BREEDING MILLS twitch is abiding and supporting by proxy
[3:38:53] <+MihriChan> Yeah I want more from these guys
[3:38:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> already bought it
[3:38:56] <@SoFarFetched> This was WAY better than the Amnesia Stream.
[3:38:59] <+MihriChan> I'm buying this right now
[3:38:59] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> fuck dat Stadia guy
[3:39:01] <%s1rcuit> so far yeah
[3:39:02] <jorniev> IF A DEV IS WATHING THIS YOU ARE DOING COOL SHIT
[3:39:02] <%luftraumm1> I would more than likely throw money at these devs
[3:39:08] <KaiserMario> This was a very short stream can't you play something else too?
[3:39:09] <%Broand> Way cooler than amnesia
[3:39:10] <%TheMattman1313> Added to the backlog list
[3:39:23] <segychan> @PatStaresAt WHENS FTL YOU COWARD
[3:39:28] <%AncelDeLambert> MUCH better tahn Amnesia
[3:39:31] <%BinaryFireball> you gonna play more of it?
[3:39:32] <%Broand> he did it he read my thing
[3:39:34] <%Ranryu692> cooler than Doom Eternal, too
[3:39:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @notkojima Twitch is molesting cats?
[3:39:42] <+Havictos> I still liked amnesia though but this is really nice
[3:39:42] <%Zaphire_Saucypants> and the theming is on point
[3:39:43] <@SoFarFetched> @BinaryFireball yeah he's gonna play more of The Signifier next week
[3:39:44] <theroomman2> yeah it sucks for narrative designers that streams and youtube makes people not buy because they saw the story. I think that's really cool that you did that there. I'm supporting this guys
[3:39:44] <Profmcstevie> Hook, topic, writing, all just FIRING full power
[3:39:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also NO JUMP SCARES so far.
[3:39:47] <Blank9> it's also more horror than amnesia
[3:39:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Not a single JUMP SCARE.
[3:39:51] <%Raymanguy13> Raymanguy13 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months, currently on a 5 month streak! Love your stuff Pat. Thanks for being great

[3:43:58] <derekwst3> if you die in the stream, you die in real life
[3:43:58] <%SaiyanShoto> 24 hour stream!
[3:44:00] <+rottingpastry> it is local, probably just you
[3:44:02] <%Cozy90> PAT YOU NEED TO WAKE UP
[3:44:02] <%arancet> youre not streaming, this is all in your head
[3:44:04] <vvaxyer> Thanks for the KPOPheart @mr_pylon
[3:44:04] <%Theo_Marks> Well now hou CANT stop strwaming
[3:44:07] <%Agami23> fucking weird.
[3:44:08] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Better keep the stream on permanently!
[3:44:08] <jorniev> IS CANADA IN ANOTHER DIMENTION!?
[3:44:08] <Teyaric> doesnt mean shit and you know it
[3:44:10] <CrisLeFortl> Pat we are trying to reach you, wake up
[3:44:10] <%AgniBrandt> You are in the stream dimension now!
[3:44:11] <%TheWinged7> so pc problem
[3:44:12] <%ChestMimik> Machine learning streamers
[3:44:13] <%TheWinged7> not router
[3:44:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Probably just need to DNS flush your computer
[3:44:16] <%rumtumtugnutz> not very poggers of you, Patrick
[3:44:17] <Make_me_mad> So the only way to keep connected is to stream? Better finish the game!
[3:44:19] <%luftraumm1> probably can solve it flushing dns
[3:44:20] <%TheMattman1313> Is Windows showing a connection error?
[3:44:20] <%ironbologna> if you end the stream pat ceases to be
[3:44:21] <KoryMccool> we aren't real pat, it's time to wake up
[3:44:22] <+CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt DNS failure, Open CMD and run the flush DNS command.
[3:44:23] <%Mr_Pylon> Oh god, Pat's an internet ghost
[3:44:25] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt I assume Paige would be screaming if the net went down, maybe you just need a reset
[3:44:27] <Maids4lyfe> DNS flush your pc
[3:44:31] <derekwst3> pat you are almost in the wrong dimension
[3:44:34] <%bevyrage> check the ethernet/wired connection?
[3:44:34] <%s1rcuit> I assume the computer the streams running on is LAN?
[3:44:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> ipconfig /flushdns
[3:44:35] <%Ranryu692> Pat, you died. This is just the form your personal Hell took
[3:44:35] <wannabemoogle> huh restart your computer?
[3:44:36] <derekwst3> yes
[3:44:37] <%TheWinged7> no
[3:44:38] <Teyaric> "Ipconfig /flushdns"
[3:44:39] <%BinaryFireball> it wont kill it
[3:44:39] <%ChestMimik> Yeah probably
[3:44:39] <%LiquidDinosaur> what happened?
[3:44:40] <%afronooch> no
[3:44:40] <%TheWinged7> it clears the cache
[3:44:40] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[3:44:40] <%DEETRz> maybe
[3:44:41] <%Agami23> i suggest trying to alt F4
[3:44:43] <Ell1ot> it shouldn't
[3:44:43] <Maids4lyfe> no
[3:44:44] <Psyramics> thank the people first
[3:44:44] <%luftraumm1> it will maybe kill the stream
[3:44:45] <+Caidezes> Never trust chat.
[3:44:45] <Fanciful_Unicorn> Might crash the stream
[3:44:45] <derekwst3> it will mess with your computor
[3:44:46] <%ironbologna> its the 3080 doing it
[3:44:46] <%Arweynn> LUL
[3:44:46] <majindusto> WAKE UP PAT.
[3:44:46] <%Typhaeon> No, ipconfig /flushdns and ipconfig /registerdns do not kill your PC
[3:44:48] <Maids4lyfe> it's safe pat
[3:44:48] <%Broand> I don't know
[3:44:48] <+CatastropheCorvid> @PatStaresAt I'm legit an IT guy.
[3:44:48] <+rottingpastry> rm -rf /
[3:44:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> `ipconfig /flushdns`
[3:44:50] <+ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> I'd wait for a mod to confirm that maybe
[3:44:51] <%TheWinged7> what teyaric said
[3:44:53] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Might kill stream
[3:44:53] <%ChestMimik> It might kill the stream
[3:44:54] <%Doruben> ipconfig /flushdns
[3:44:56] <Goodvibes99508> the game has infected your compuer
[3:44:56] <+Yakobro> no
[3:44:56] <jorniev> WHAT DID HE SAY?
[3:44:57] <@SoFarFetched> yes
[3:44:57] <Bigyanno> JUST DO IT PERFECT FIRST TIME PAT
[3:44:57] <Teyaric> Then "Ipconfig /release"
