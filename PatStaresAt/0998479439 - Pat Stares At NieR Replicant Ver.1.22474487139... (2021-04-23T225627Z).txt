[0:08:38] <2017y> nier not automata has like, original plot concepts, a plot, characters that have reasons for existing, a conclusion, stakes, plot twists that arent just twists for the sake of having a twist, novel things that happen in the game that got soullessly xeroxed into the sequel

[0:17:59] <+warlockwithapixie> Man, stream is skipping a lot for me.
[0:18:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I imagine Canada couldn't get much supply because Trump literally stole the world supply with money (after saying it's not real or a threat, but hoarding it for rich people).
[0:18:02] <%AzureGale> Oh

[0:22:07] <%delilah4you> delilah4you subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 20 months! The reason we like those things even though they arent a part of our politics, I think, is because we see them as their best selves, outside of the politics of our world. Like James Bond is always in the right becuase he's the good guy in his world.
[0:22:07] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I'd say I don't agree with the politics in House of Cards, but I understand them and agree more than I admit

[0:22:25] <%superc37> ignore that sry
[0:22:27] <SomeAsianDood> @MelonSouda I'm not sure what that entails, but it's not hard to come up with a couple of theories

[0:25:39] <%Valdorick> I can't believe the Shadow Lord is really 9s in a Bluemage from FF14 outfit.
[0:25:39] <zerointeligence> Wish Yoko Taro wrote another game that ends with, "Gets Devoured by Large God Babies"
[0:25:46] <%Kurokoi64> @SGrim good man
[0:25:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I will say I forgot the old play through mostly EXCEPT THE BIG STUFF that stuck out, which makes me "test" things in this game that I never played...

[0:25:59] <%thetunnelhomer> When you finish Ending A and a Dwarf just waddles into the camera.

[0:26:26] <%dankgerald> they had the hot brother nier
[0:26:27] <JcGross> Pc version works fine for me. Using Dual sense with steam's controller support. Button prompts are xbox buttons in every game anyway...
[0:26:29] <%AzureGale> All the stuff is better contextualized when Nier is a kid
[0:26:30] <%LaughingCatt> its the best
[0:26:30] <%Valdorick> The shattered old man desperately trying to hold onto anything he can to stay sane while looking for his dying daughter's sickness
[0:26:30] <+itsgundamu> I miss papa Nier, is there anyway to play him on the steam version?
[0:26:34] <%ssjklyco> And he was the Best version of Nier
[0:26:34] <%depotagents> that's what makes papa nier fun! he's cute
[0:26:36] <%thetunnelhomer> I will miss Caveman Nier
[0:26:37] <olm46> It turned out to be the secret to success.
[0:26:37] <%Aeogard> brother Nier is cool, still prefer papa

[0:27:07] <%baronouroboros> My headcanon is that Papa Nier is actually Brother Nier's and Yonah's dad.
[0:27:07] <LorcaNomad> yes
[0:27:09] <%depotagents> @itsgundamu He's got concept art... psaSmug
[0:27:10] <+itsgundamu> @SomeAsianDood oh so you can't play the whole game as him?
[0:27:11] <gecomaman> The most lovable ugliest MC ever
[0:27:13] <%Valdorick> It worked too
[0:27:14] <%BoxNavy> and it worked (for me)
[0:27:16] <EynosStyles> If Daddy Neir is voice by Progressive insurance guy
[0:27:17] <%AzureGale> It worked tho
[0:27:17] <yourliteraldog> Lol
[0:27:17] <%ChestMimik> We like the old
[0:27:17] <+warlockwithapixie> It worked
[0:27:18] <%patriotrenegade> that wasnt in the original game
[0:27:18] <%pilgrimsayswhat> and it WORKED
[0:27:18] <ShawnEXE> Yeah like you didn't need to mention that already
[0:27:18] <%baronouroboros> Papa nier is brother nier's dad.
[0:27:19] <waffleandman> and it WORKED
[0:27:19] <%TimesApex> The west can only understand angry old men
[0:27:19] <%LaughingCatt> & it worked!
[0:27:19] <%ramielthe5th> No fortnite :(((

[0:27:20] <%pilgrimsayswhat> ZADDY NIER
[0:27:22] <%NitronStreams> And It WORKED
[0:27:24] <%Ranryu692> And they were right
[0:27:26] <%Huntercd> It didn't appeal to me though
[0:27:27] <SomeAsianDood> as far as I know, no @itsgundamu
[0:27:27] <%Nuclearcherries> We like the uggos
[0:27:28] <@SSaryn> They were right honestly.
[0:27:29] <%dankgerald> america liked the Room, so we got dad nier
[0:27:30] <laserbeaming> and they were right
[0:27:30] <%BoxNavy> they were right. brother nier is cute though
[0:27:30] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> it fuckin worked
[0:27:30] <%ChestMimik> THEY WEREN'T WRONG
[0:27:31] <FoxInABeret> And they were RIGHT
[0:27:31] <+Thunder_Poo> What are you opinions of the big woman from the new Resident Evil game? @PatStaresAt
[0:27:32] <%depotagents> It's true I DO want dads
[0:27:32] <%AzureGale> Square wasn't wrong
[0:27:33] <%ssjklyco> It came out on Xbox as well, and only adults play games on Xbox
[0:27:33] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean were they wrong?
[0:27:33] <JeysJumbleJams> RUE
[0:27:33] <%JohnAtDawn> MAN THEY WERE WRONG
[0:27:33] <Jontman42> NO THEY'RE WRONG
[0:27:34] <cardamomo88> IT WAS RIRHT
[0:27:35] <CosmoSire> Kinda true
[0:27:35] <%JoshManVGH> And it worked, Ugly Old Anime Man was cool!
[0:27:35] <MKII> we want hunky dads
[0:27:35] <JeysJumbleJams> TRUE
[0:27:36] <Vertigheist> And they were right
[0:27:37] <%baronouroboros> In Gestalt, brother Nier dies, but in Replicant Papa Nier dies.
[0:27:37] <TheRealNumberJ42> and the game still sold like shit so
[0:27:37] <%thetunnelhomer> Nier invented the Grumpy Dad Game.
[0:27:38] <%cvp5127> boooo
[0:27:39] <%dankgerald> the road, for fucks sake
[0:27:39] <%pilgrimsayswhat> like a damn FIDDLE
[0:27:40] <%DEETRz> papa nier best nier
[0:27:40] <%za7az> THEY WERE RIGHT
[0:27:41] <%aishman> AND THEY'RE RIGHT
[0:27:41] <Tonuha> I do prefer papa Nier over the whole Oniichan ordeal
[0:27:42] <cardamomo88> PAPA NIER BEST NIER
[0:27:43] <%delilah4you> Nier, like Saturdays, were made for dads
[0:27:44] <marvel877> And they were right.
[0:27:44] <%YakumoYomi> It worked, because Papa Nier > Brother Nier
[0:27:45] <Pt_Kamen> NieR Gestalt
[0:27:45] <%cvp5127> they're wrong
[0:27:46] <%aishman> GIVE US PAPA NIER
[0:27:49] <gothmanmothman> tbh we love a good himbo dad
[0:27:49] <%livlinn> DILF!!!!!! shiaHypers
[0:27:50] <LorcaNomad> they were super fucking right to make that decision
[0:27:50] <%baronouroboros> Both are canon.
[0:27:52] <+robertoszek> Ahead of the curve with that, look at Kratos
[0:27:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> knowing what I know about NieR OG and noticing various programming AI choices
[0:27:53] <%Aeoneth> Slam fuckin Dunk
[0:27:53] <%LaughingCatt> They where 100% right
[0:27:55] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> was this game before or after Last of Us 1
[0:27:55] <karovus> young nier is fine but papa nier is fucking great
[0:27:57] <@SSaryn> To be fair, due to circumstances, Brother Nier is still much better tone wise.

[0:28:44] <%ringabal> So are the Sad Fathers
[0:28:44] <yourliteraldog> I'm the younger brother and my older brother is shit.
[0:28:47] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:28:47] <+DBTenno> It's mainly due to Japan's obsession with brother-sister relationships in Alabama.
[0:28:47] <Vertigheist> I hate my father but I’m whatever with either nierse

[0:28:50] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt The dynamic of a father sacrificing everything for a child gels better than brother and sister
[0:28:51] <@SSaryn> A weirdo who just wants to help.
[0:28:51] <%JoshManVGH> YOU could be Bro Nier
[0:28:52] <%illusiveSaint> anyone can try to imagine being a better parent but a sibling is something else
[0:28:53] <Blank9> he's as weird as every NPC

[0:28:56] <$SGrim> @baronouroboros Paige streams yalk about Pat's brother trying to fuck her all the time
[0:28:56] <gothmanmothman> Ngl the fantasy of a good dad who just tries to do better for their child hits hard imo b/c where tf is that energy irl sometimes lmao
[0:28:56] <%Valdorick> The Backstory is also slightly changed, like how Brother Nier gets fucked by a gross old man for money, and Papa Nier just kills the shit out of more monsters for the same money.
[0:28:57] <+bunchaghosts> ZADDY
[0:28:58] <%bootsjay> i think his brother stole his ps1

[0:29:12] <%Mendin> He is a badass dad. He is a dadass
[0:29:13] <+sunsetdisc0> Papa Nier was a sad dad before it was cool
[0:29:13] <%radda343> I bet they add papa nier back in as dlc
[0:29:14] <FoxInABeret> Papa Nier is a little like Kiryu but in a fantasy world where he's all-in on the fantasy.

[0:34:28] <%Dakuu75> Lol
[0:34:28] <+TenguGemini> but doesnt healing increase enmity?
[0:34:29] <+zuzuxiv> PLDs use MP to cast clemency, they should use it for DPS instead so it's like
[0:34:31] <Basch71> I never trust healers as a tank
[0:34:33] <Daniel_Is_I> Also for context: clemency is a DPS loss
[0:34:36] <MKII> doesnt it just mean, keep dpsing healer
[0:34:36] <%LonePlus_> war heal
[0:34:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wouldn't trust people either, I would totally do that
[0:34:39] <+AnActualHermitCrab> Only self healing SPELL technically.
[0:34:39] <@SSaryn> As a RDM, you will NOT heal that tank. You will HELP the healer by keeping them up instead if it is NEEDED.
[0:34:40] <blue8moon> The ones that frustrate me are when they start using clemency at like 80-90% health
[0:34:41] <%LonePlus_> its all we have besides fell cleave
[0:34:41] <penitentpendant> If I have 2 WHM and 0 Regen on me when I am MT'ing, of course I don't trust you
[0:34:43] <EynosStyles> @patstaresat Is Warframe good right now?
[0:34:43] <%delilah4you> It could also mean "I want to help you heal other people, or I'm bored and wanna do something other than the same combo every 2 seconds"
[0:34:43] <JeysJumbleJams> gotcha, i won't do that when i get to paladin lol
[0:34:43] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:34:45] <%Treuan> I never trust tank as healer
[0:34:46] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> AST's Essential Dignity is all about keeping hp low
[0:34:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Trust your healers fuckers
[0:34:49] <%JoshManVGH> But... it's part of the kit. Stab get stronger if HP max
[0:34:49] <Visorak6> Healing is rough
[0:34:49] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Oh you saw that
[0:34:49] <%alcors_wisdom> but what if the healer is one of these "toxic casuals"
[0:34:51] <%Alazull> That's toxic af
[0:34:52] <@SSaryn> Nope.
[0:34:53] <+Eureka_seveN77> but if you let them die then you wipe
[0:34:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Never Trust Healers.
[0:34:55] <reemasbaid> Bro I like that FLCL shirt
[0:34:55] <%pilgrimsayswhat> do it because you can psaSmug
[0:34:56] <%baronouroboros> Is FF14 even playable solo?
[0:34:59] <%baronouroboros> probably not.
[0:35:02] <%valriot> Holy Spirit is actually orse than Glare though so EHHHH LUL LUL
[0:35:02] <%radda343> Bitch you ain't dead" is basically how I heal
[0:35:02] <%ironohki> The new Warframe music is pretty great.
[0:35:03] <%superc37> eh kinda
[0:35:03] <%Dakuu75> Accept the trust fall bro
[0:35:05] <%Monkeyweed21> kinda
[0:35:08] <%Daxalog> All of you mmo archetypes are so fucked up
[0:35:08] <$Futurecity10> I have an 80 healer and I would love it if the tank healed itself
[0:35:08] <@SSaryn> Just watch it then ez
[0:35:10] <%DEETRz> @baronouroboros its very solo friendly
[0:35:12] <%superc37> they fixed railjack
[0:35:13] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> Trust the healer because the healer knows. He knows everything.
[0:35:13] <MuffinMastr> rubrLUL rubrLUL
[0:35:13] <mai_cu> Quest was cool but eh
[0:35:13] <peyodogo> warrior has equilibrium AND nascent flash
[0:35:15] <%ChestMimik> YOU'VE never seen COREY IN THE HOUSE
[0:35:15] <%ironohki> Warframe has a second "We Lift Together" level song now.
[0:35:15] <%pilgrimsayswhat> the greatest shonen of our time
[0:35:16] <elpennacho> PogChamp
[0:35:16] <%alcors_wisdom> its not that great its just a meme
[0:35:17] <%weissguard> The Best Anime Ever, Kappa
[0:35:18] <cardamomo88> BEST ANIME
[0:35:18] <yourliteraldog> RESPECT YOUR HEALER we have a god complex
[0:35:22] <EynosStyles> @baronouroboros up to a point
[0:35:23] <NekoUrabe> irl anime
[0:35:23] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You've never seen the BEsT aniME in the wORLD?
[0:35:24] <%monsieurfantastic> cory in the house is sick!!!
[0:35:24] <SulfurousAcid> Cory In the House is the best anime of our time
[0:35:25] <%patriotrenegade> Really??? Its a great anime
[0:35:26] <+ReallyBigRocks> It was a spinoff of That's So Raven right?
[0:35:26] <+hephep_311> pat you a busta
[0:35:27] <MKII> isnt half the cast of corey in the house criminal now
[0:35:27] <+eanscrale> The new frame and quest or good, the new mode is... not so much
[0:35:31] <+DBTenno> Warframe still hasn't refunded players who bothered to grind Railjack after the last patch basically told them to screw themselves and grind more cred
[0:35:32] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt the first few seasons of criminal minds is actually LEGIT good
[0:35:33] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[0:35:35] <@SSaryn> Hmm.
[0:35:35] <$Futurecity10> God primal must suck ass
[0:35:38] <@SSaryn> I see.
[0:35:39] <CosmoSire> @baronouroboros If you don't mind groups of random people, it's possible. Boring thou
[0:35:40] <%baronouroboros> ah, I see. Just the raids need teams.
[0:35:41] <LorcaNomad> monkaS
[0:35:42] <+sinistersally> goodbye cables
[0:35:42] <SulfurousAcid> kaiS
[0:35:43] <+Birdigalore> Menacing chewing
[0:35:43] <%Arweynn> UHOH
[0:35:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @MKII lol i hope so
[0:35:44] <Sunstalker> Isn't Corey being investigated for pedo shit?
[0:35:44] <Srthunda> If you heal yourself then just accept that I will let you heal yourself for the rest of the duty
[0:35:44] <42nfl19> o hno
[0:35:46] <%bootsjay> psaDogchamp
[0:35:48] <+ReallyBigRocks> mysterious chewing
[0:35:50] <$RealThiele> rip gate
[0:35:52] <%baronouroboros> yeah.
[0:35:52] <NekoUrabe> Elmo became the food
[0:35:53] <Darth_Vexus> I tried FF14, but it honestly kind of bored me with the loops
[0:35:53] <%bassoontyphoon> A few months ago it was “Covid in the house”
[0:35:54] <@SSaryn> @baronouroboros Yeah no you're not getting through FFXIV without groups.
[0:35:54] <2017y> @futurecity10 tanks need to use action economy on holding threat so that the dps can do their job. self heals dont generate any threat comparitively
[0:35:55] <%ChestMimik> oh no
[0:35:55] <elpennacho> i want to see the baby
[0:35:59] <%BigDumBeak> him eat elmo
[0:36:03] <%bootsjay> paige noooooo
[0:36:08] <%watts121> I'm still upset that we didn't get to see Pat cry like a big fat baby during 5.3
[0:36:09] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> I do some experts on Primal once a few months and everytime I get bads that make me want to stop playing
[0:36:22] <%JoshManVGH> Man I've been playing PLD and RDM wrong... i ve been tossing heals where it felt appropriate.
[0:36:22] <$Futurecity10> its like a 2 second button press what the fuck are you talking about
[0:36:37] <%bassoontyphoon> So is this still pre game stream time
[0:36:39] <Pt_Kamen> 5$ says it's toilet paper
[0:36:45] <%JoshManVGH> Number down? Not anymore
[0:36:55] <%bootsjay> yep bassoon
[0:36:55] <peyodogo> @2017y well, aside from niche stuff like warrior using equilibrium in the opener to overheal and generate extra aggro, back when aggro was a concern at all
[0:36:56] <%thedankestmeeme> thats quick
[0:36:57] <waffleandman> man FF14 sound so unappealing rn...
[0:36:58] <%BoxNavy> welp
[0:36:58] <+Thunder_Poo> @PatStaresAt If you where stranded on an Island that was divided between people that like ears and people that like toes, what side of the island would you go to?
[0:36:59] <%baronouroboros> Anyway, my hot-take is that Papa Nier is Brother Nier's dad.
[0:37:02] <LorcaNomad> monkaS x100
[0:37:02] <%thedankestmeeme> was it his penis?
[0:37:05] <%BoxNavy> thats for future pat to deal with

[0:39:14] <Dwarven_Gaming> WHAT
[0:39:15] <2017y> a japanese conviction rate
[0:39:15] <olm46> Kaine's outfit is inferior
[0:39:15] <SailingSaturn> Kaine is a better character
[0:39:15] <Broken_Sonex> WHO'S GOT THE BIGGER ASS?
[0:39:17] <%VioletHeart> So you want A2?
[0:39:17] <cardamomo88> kaine¡¡
[0:39:19] <Manwad> 2B's ass is bigger
[0:39:19] <%AzureGale> The difference between fiction and reality is that fiction has to make sense
[0:39:19] <%Valdorick> A2 vs 2B
[0:39:19] <peyodogo> kaine 100% personality wise
[0:39:20] <%depotagents> Kaine vs Zero is the REAL question
[0:39:20] <%thelaxinator> I like Kaines... uhm
[0:39:20] <Mudze7> 2B is barely a character
[0:39:20] <%BoxNavy> 2b is great
[0:39:20] <nevan_44> WH-
[0:39:20] <%superc37> COWARD
[0:39:21] <Dwarven_Gaming> kaine
[0:39:21] <$SGrim> EASIEST KAINE
[0:39:21] <%bootsjay> do we get a playable kaine this time
[0:39:21] <yourliteraldog> Fiction is a happy place
[0:39:24] <%WhereIsWill> 2B all day
[0:39:25] <+coldhandzack> Kaine
[0:39:25] <favadem> ASS
[0:39:26] <maskedmook> Kaine is better in every way
[0:39:26] <%Aleate> 🍑
[0:39:26] <%DEETRz> you cowards
[0:39:28] <kingdinkyI> Huh
[0:39:28] <%patriotrenegade> Which Kaine, human or Replicant?
[0:39:29] <UberKingKai> My girlfriend watches these streams by means of me and hearing if you get the gun
[0:39:29] <+warlockwithapixie> Designwize 2B is GREAT
[0:39:29] <%Nuclearcherries> Kaine would peg you no doubt
[0:39:29] <+JackalKing> Kaine's attitude, 2B's design. Exactly.
[0:39:30] <CosmoSire> Those characters are too intelligent to be law enforcement
[0:39:31] <karl_rex> So A2 then
[0:39:31] <$Ziegsy> I played this this morning, the biggest change from papa nier is you no longer jump crotch first
[0:39:31] <%TimetodiveLTX> 2b's ass has more polygons, next question
[0:39:31] <%Axellogic> I like the one that wears pants
[0:39:31] <snivins> what part of 2B Kappa
[0:39:31] <nevan_44> kaine <3
[0:39:33] <%GalacticaPhanto> I thought you want super tsundere
[0:39:33] <%Daxalog> Whod win in a fight?
[0:39:36] <$SGrim> #FullPackageFutanari
[0:39:37] <+DBTenno> 2B was designed for THICC perfection.
[0:39:37] <%JohnAtDawn> Kaine has a penis though?
[0:39:37] <pi_in_the_sci> 2A is the way
[0:39:38] <cardamomo88> kaine
[0:39:39] <SailingSaturn> You think Kaine wouldn't LUL
[0:39:40] <JetpackMcQuack> Kaine is a human
[0:39:40] <stukamod> 2B got knockoffs, Kaine didn't
[0:39:41] <%GarbageQueenEllie> A robogirl after my own heart
[0:39:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I just changed to the A2 wardrobe
[0:39:42] <%pilgrimsayswhat> the BABY

[0:39:48] <Manwad> its the baby ooooooooo
[0:39:48] <amonimis> ELMO

[0:39:52] <SoaringTrumpet> orangekitPeaches

[0:39:56] <+robosqueeb> why did i just join in and hear "penis"

[0:45:27] <QuasarKnightGaming> @patstaresat I mean cats like vibrations and compression, both help spread their scent to new objects. This also helps the cat feel safe and involved while receiving attention. Science.
[0:45:27] <%ssjklyco> set camera zoom to far away

[0:50:49] <JetpackMcQuack> Oni-nier
[0:50:49] <FirewallStorm> Not old
[0:50:50] <%Treuan> Because it's not giving the shadowlord a big sloppy kiss?
[0:50:50] <%AzureGale> @Visorak6 Not Pat but I can confirm that it is Liam O' Brien
[0:50:51] <TioXyco> @cvp5127 Weiss

[0:51:00] <%Eaglestrike117> wait, which book is that?
[0:51:00] <%thelaxinator> It's weird that it's salt, not snow, and it's the summer right now, but they are still wearing winter clothes
[0:51:01] <olm46> Brother Nier starts out younger
[0:51:04] <Parapattern> Fuckin' Jack Frost lookin' MF

[0:51:04] <%doomunderthestairs> Pat is this the PS5 version or PC?
[0:51:05] <Man_in_the_Red> so, Zaddie Nier is in the game but is he a costume or is he the design post time skip
[0:51:06] <%RetroCop87> so, uh, question: why do shaeds exist in 2053?

[0:51:29] <MKII> it has RIPOSTES now
[0:51:30] <TioXyco> the combat feels so good]
[0:51:30] <Ciglossonjr> If it’s summer why is his breath showing
[0:51:30] <Explodincatz> kill um all patty
[0:51:30] <%Valdorick> It does not play like a Drakengard
[0:51:32] <+burkey0307> seems like the hit delay was removed

[0:51:34] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Does it play like Cloud in FF7R?

[0:51:44] <%FallenAngelSC2> I hope DoD 3 gets the 1.22474487139 treatment
[0:51:45] <cardamomo88> sis
[0:51:46] <+ThisIsLloyd> one thing I never got is why are the shades attacking them
[0:51:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I personally think the Parry is sloppier
[0:51:50] <waffleandman> ONICHAN!
[0:51:50] <%snackcanary> Didn't someone from Platinum oversee combat changes?

[0:52:21] <Profmcstevie> Does oni-chan need to slap a bitch
[0:52:23] <%thedankestmeeme> YONAHH!!!
[0:52:26] <GeltonZ> @Vertigheist Actually Papa Nier is OG and twink Nier was made to appease Japanese audiences. It's complicated.

[0:52:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @Aeogard i agree but that game is like a 6/10 outside of the music and story
[0:52:29] <%za7az> @ThisIsLloyd I think they are confused and scared?

[0:52:53] <roosevelt770> No its a newer VA
[0:52:53] <Silly_Duckling> There's a whole industry in trying to be Yuri Lowenthal
[0:52:54] <%the22cstomp> @GeltonZ but what about fate unlimited codes
[0:52:54] <+Gespens> Young Nier is Zach Aguilar, post-time skip is Ray Chase

[0:53:22] <GeltonZ> @the22cstomp That's an Eighting game, not really a Cavia game.

[0:53:37] <%bootsjay> zach aguilar

[0:54:05] <%TimetodiveLTX> holy shit
[0:54:06] <%Fooguwu> hatHyper hatHyper hatHyper
[0:54:07] <GeltonZ> @Vertigheist Nier WAS meant for the West. It was made to appeal to Western audiences, but the dev team couldn't stand how the main character looked so they changed him during development.
[0:54:08] <%patriotrenegade> VERGIL
[0:54:08] <42nfl19> NERO
[0:54:08] <%valriot> SHADE SCHUM
[0:54:08] <nevan_44> monkaS
[0:54:08] <%radda343> Nier was Vergil all along
[0:54:09] <cheapdoc> more like virgen
[0:54:13] <EynosStyles> what the deal with the book anyway

[0:54:16] <%RetroCop87> His name is VER...
[0:54:17] <%JoshManVGH> "You must not read from the book!"
[0:54:18] <bootsjay> the voice actor is zach aguilar
[0:54:18] <%ringabal> "To see the world in a grain of sand..."
[0:54:20] <RWLJr98> What is happening :) explain all the lore to me Pat :)
[0:54:21] <umbraawitch> "where do you work out" "the library"
[0:54:21] <mr_saturday93> I AM THE STORM THAT KS APPROACHING
[0:54:22] <+JustToWatch> Vergil would very much change the tone of this game
[0:54:22] <%Valdorick> Reminder there's a researcher team near them RIGHT NOW.
[0:54:24] <%the22cstomp> PAUNCH
[0:54:25] <%livlinn> MAMORU
[0:54:25] <%neroforte177> I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROCHING
[0:54:30] <cardamomo88> ShowOfHands ShowOfHands
[0:54:33] <devanmuse> Since most OG Nier spoilers are fair game, I'm going to ask, since a lot of stuff about this setting I still don't realyly understand: At this point, Nier and Yonah are still human, right?
[0:54:38] <+cafefunk> I thought the main character of this game was an older man
[0:54:39] <%ShinobiPhoenix> POWAH OWAH OAWH
[0:54:47] <Alfred_Waaghur> Snow in Summer is awesome
[0:54:48] <%livlinn> psaBig bonk
[0:54:50] <%radda343> protecc imouto
[0:54:51] <MKII> jump + strong while rising to High Time I think it's new to this version?
[0:54:52] <$SGrim> Knowledge is power, so read these hands
[0:54:52] <+cafefunk> and the girl was his daughter
[0:54:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> fun fact: the numbers in the title is just the square root of 1.5
[0:54:54] <NekoUrabe> @devanmuse yes
[0:54:54] <olm46> The ancient hoodie
[0:54:54] <mr_saturday93> There's a group of normal humans rn watching them?
[0:54:56] <%za7az> @devanmuse Yes
[0:54:57] <Finakala> Snow in Summer hype
[0:54:57] <%depotagents> @devanmuse Yeah, this is the OG nier and yonah
[0:54:58] <umbraawitch> @cafefunk that was for the western release
[0:54:59] <%valriot> Hobo Nier
[0:55:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> "stay away from the summoner!"
[0:55:00] <GeltonZ> @cafefunk That's the 360 version of Nier
[0:55:01] <+cafefunk> did they change the plot
[0:55:03] <silent_weapon> FLY ME TO THE MOON
[0:55:04] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> is NieR supposed to have this "slurry" look to it?
[0:55:06] <%solracc25> BUEY THE LIGHT
[0:55:06] <Jontman42> stay away from Nezuk- I mean Yonah
[0:55:10] <+Birdigalore> The frames!
[0:55:16] <%RetroCop87> I wonder if this pipe is the same model from Automata
[0:55:16] <+ninja_galt> yo yo yo ya Yonah
[0:55:17] <UTaken34> BUSTER
[0:55:18] <NeutrinoInteraction> I miss Papa Nier
[0:55:21] <gothmanmothman> Wow!!! I forgot that I love this game!!!
[0:55:24] <%thelaxinator> Track is called "snow in summer" by the way
[0:55:24] <$Ziegsy> @top_lane_duelist yeah looks dusty. always has
[0:55:26] <TheRealNumberJ42> dang this combat is way smoother
[0:55:26] <RWLJr98> Is this a remake of the first game or something newwwww?
[0:55:32] <%Fooguwu> Remember to only ever use the spear pat
[0:55:33] <cardamomo88> BIG FIST GO BAM
[0:55:33] <+ninja_galt> Papa nier was a better design
[0:55:34] <Kriss1827> "Power of the Black Book"
[0:55:34] <gecomaman> The best ability, love that fucking hand
[0:55:36] <CosmoSire> Da Apple metaphors
[0:55:36] <brachydios777> Cast FIST
[0:55:36] <%livlinn> Wow musou
[0:55:37] <+Birdigalore> This boy's got air dashes?!
[0:55:38] <GeltonZ> @RWLJr98 Remake thus far
[0:55:42] <amonimis> not a remake or a remaster :)
[0:55:43] <%the22cstomp> and much cooler
[0:55:44] <+robertoszek> huh, so young Nier voice actor also voiced Gendo and Noctis
[0:55:45] <umbraawitch> here comes the giant fist
[0:55:46] <%AzureGale> Automata was super rapid fire though
[0:55:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> i got used to brother nier in a few hours
[0:55:47] <ToneBacas> Pat isn't playing in hard difficulty, is he? I watched someone do it earlier today and the enemies are just tanky as fuck, no real difficulty aspect to it besides bullet sponges
[0:55:52] <$Ziegsy> i beat the game with this and dark lance
[0:55:53] <stormhawk9891> @Finakala That ain't snow mate
[0:55:54] <%Axellogic> murder those children!
[0:55:55] <%JoshManVGH> Is there a dodge variation on the fist?
[0:55:57] <Vertigheist> @ninja_galt his ugly mug was charming in a way
[0:55:58] <%barkon345> I obviously knew that Liam O'brien voiced Grimoire vice but I had no idea that Laura Bailey voiced Kaine
[0:55:58] <$SGrim> Beat the GHOST CHILDREN
[0:56:00] <penitentpendant> Absorb all the blood!
[0:56:00] <$HyperionXV> Normal difficulty
[0:56:02] <%ringabal> Oh god, the SHADOWBABIES
[0:56:02] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> gotcha, thought it was like weird performance from my pc or something
[0:56:04] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Grimoire > Pods
[0:56:05] <%athuramn> if he's gaining so many levels now, what was he doing this whole time
[0:56:06] <%Valdorick> YEAH! SNUFF THOSE CHILDREN
[0:56:07] <Overhaul180> What's the downside to the book again?  I don't think they ever explain why he's so against it
[0:56:08] <%Rumbutt> How are you liking these new DRK changes Pat?
[0:56:08] <+tactician0> kill them all
[0:56:08] <trickster721> It's an update, version 1.2 etc
[0:56:10] <%graemebl> @cakefunk This remake follows a version of the game previously only available in Japan
[0:56:12] <%pilgrimsayswhat> ooooooo violins
[0:56:17] <olm46> Punt the little ones
[0:56:17] <+AutechreTwinAphex> hard difficulty is pretty cool, you'll have to parry a lot
[0:56:17] <+ninja_galt> Moistcr1tical also said on hard the enemies have way too much HP
[0:56:18] <dmtjinni> is this game cool or what?
[0:56:20] <gecomaman> No Anakin!
[0:56:22] <cheapdoc> That magic is looking clean
[0:56:25] <kingdinkyI> There goes are favourites kid killer
[0:56:25] <%sporeian94> Damn this game just giving you levels left and right...
[0:56:26] <+critikal_bit> oooooh the music amps up
[0:56:28] <CosmoSire> Kid the impaler
[0:56:31] <%depotagents> @Overhaul180 Infects you with red eye disease doesn;t it..
[0:56:32] <%livlinn> Haha look at this full class psaWhat
[0:56:32] <cheapdoc> YES anaking
[0:56:36] <jcflyguy> Yeah the enemies are sponges on hard
[0:56:36] <%bootsjay> yeah the powers in nier automata are like unsatisfying shotguns
[0:56:37] <%Agami23> they are alot more meaty than the pods
[0:56:37] <+Gespens> The Grimoire is a lot more effective than the Pod
[0:56:38] <%WhereIsWill> this game already looks so amazing
[0:56:51] <%ringabal> "Kick Da Baby!"
[0:56:53] <%AzureGale> AIR COMBO
[0:56:54] <nmaten> is the combat much better than the original?
[0:56:55] <+G_Thunders> Do they ever explain why the books also function as weapons? I forget
[0:56:56] <%pilgrimsayswhat> i love this new version of the song
[0:56:59] <Ryutaryi> Probably going to pick this up after finals
[0:56:59] <Overhaul180> @depotagents I don't think it's related, the books are meant to fight that
[0:57:00] <brachydios777> Nier is fast af
[0:57:01] <+hephep_311> any chance the improved gameplay breaks the difficulty?
[0:57:07] <Jontman42> MUSIC IS SO GOOD
[0:57:10] <FoxInABeret> @sporeian94 It's for narrative purposes in this intro. The main game is different.
[0:57:15] <%athuramn> damn, Harry du bois kicking some real ass
[0:57:16] <MKII> spoilers he levels fast because nier got isekai'd and is a cheater
[0:57:18] <spiderously> Damn! the music is great.
[0:57:19] <%za7az> @Gespens Magic more effective than bullets? Who knew LUL
[0:57:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I definitely can't wait to find out for myself why Automata doesn't have magic if it's a sequel
[0:57:21] <%Alazull> Hit triangle
[0:57:23] <gecomaman> You have less air dodge than 2B though
[0:57:23] <42nfl19> So what is this that @PatStaresAt mentioned different content between PC and PS4?
[0:57:29] <CosmoSire> So they just fixed the junk, but mostly left it in tact?
[0:57:31] <GeltonZ> My big question is how good the dodging is. Because dodging was the one thing the original did well and I feel like it wasn't as good in Automata.
[0:57:36] <+tactician0> kill all the civili... I mean monsters yeah monsters
[0:57:43] <%Puhff> I don't understand, where is OldMan Nier?
[0:57:43] <%depotagents> @Gespens arent the bullets literally magic in nier universe tho..
[0:57:43] <%Axellogic> @hephep_311 the easy ass original game's difficulty?
[0:57:46] <SlangPunk> @g_thunders They use blood magic, so it can double as offensive stuff
[0:57:47] <%livlinn> I don’t like this human whisper noises NotLikeThis
[0:57:49] <%athuramn> @42nfl19 not sure about content but pc version is currently busted
[0:57:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is a cool tutorial
[0:57:58] <+Tuna__Melt> Pat are you hyped for the Mass Effect remaster?
[0:57:58] <+hephep_311> @GeltonZ dodging was amazing in automata
[0:57:58] <GeltonZ> @CosmoSire Well it's questionable since it's Brother Nier instead of Papa Nier.
[0:57:59] <+RealPT1> I kinda hated how the "spells" in automata were on such long cooldowns and weren't really worth it in the long run
[0:58:02] <%Valdorick> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
[0:58:03] <%barkon345> I will say the new Pretty Graphics and better combat still don't compensate for this games god Aweful level design
[0:58:04] <Broken_Sonex> I missed the those stupid big red orbs
[0:58:05] <MonoReaper> @ShinobiPhoenix ??? In Automata you literally see the androids use magic there is even the angelic accord in their magical attacks?
[0:58:05] <+ShotgunJesus> definitely my fave spell
[0:58:16] <RWLJr98> Anime magic WutFace
[0:58:16] <nmaten> dodging in automata is so good what
[0:58:17] <%Order_of_Mystery> Order_of_Mystery subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 21 months! Oh hey, 21 months of staring at you staring at games!
[0:58:19] <Savior127> Not gonna lie, really starting to miss the original's sound effects.
[0:58:20] <maskedmook> dark lance and dark hand are still the best spells
[0:58:21] <zubasterd> is he just a warlock?
[0:58:22] <+RealPT1> they mean something here and you have to manage your meter to an extent
[0:58:24] <GeltonZ> @hephep_311 I disagree. It has too much start up and recovery and felt bad compared to the original.
[0:58:28] <%ringabal> QUICK SHINJI, THE LANCE
[0:58:32] <%bootsjay> wanna have an enjoyable game of nier automata leave it on easy and go to where you first fight adam after defeating him turtn on auto attack and just let your character go to town on them for a couple hours lvl99 no probs
[0:58:35] <TrollKing96> I wonder if TheDarkId will do an LP of this?
[0:58:36] <%baronouroboros> helmbreaker
[0:58:36] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @zubasterd pretty much honestly
[0:58:37] <%Valdorick> Oh man, it sounds like the Shades are saying something as they're dying... must just be pointless noise.
[0:58:40] <%Rumbutt> Dark Lance, we're friends now!
[0:58:44] <+hephep_311> @GeltonZ it doesnt? it's instantaneous and you can cancel out of anything
[0:58:45] <$Mudze7> new?
[0:58:50] <Tonuha> "Oh I love you Dark Lance, go ahead and give me a big sloppy kiss Dark Lance"
[0:58:52] <KohryuZX> Is Pat playing on PC?
[0:58:52] <Alfred_Waaghur> The music!
[0:58:53] <%Mendin> Automata "magic" is a data-based descendant, they specify during some late game side missions that True Old-World Magic is a league above the androids shit
[0:58:56] <%BoxNavy> yonah D:
[0:58:58] <%pilgrimsayswhat> yeah nier is totally a warlock
[0:58:58] <GeltonZ> @hephep_311 Not as well as you could in the original.
[0:58:58] <FirewallStorm> God I remember how I love this more than the robot now
[0:58:59] <CosmoSire> @GeltonZ That's the price we pay for not trash combat EntropyWins :(
[0:59:00] <TioXyco> god, this build up
[0:59:06] <%bootsjay> ps5
[0:59:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> the combat music transitions is Kreygasm
[0:59:10] <$Ziegsy> this guy you can farm for combos
[0:59:17] <%Treuan> Wow this takes me back
[0:59:17] <SulfurousAcid> big boi and his add frens
[0:59:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @monoreaper I take it as "technology so advanced it seems like Magic". no need to be weirdly aggressive. geez
[0:59:22] <+ninja_galt> What if yonah is his step-sis now...
[0:59:26] <FirewallStorm> it's hard to beat the feeling of having add magic floating book fire deadly spells
[0:59:27] <%ringabal> Turok, and his Shadow Babies
[0:59:29] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> oh they've changed up the music a bit
[0:59:29] <+hephep_311> @GeltonZ i think you remember incorectly, it's broken good.
[0:59:30] <GeltonZ> @CosmoSire I didn't think the original played that bad. Actually quit Automata because I didn't like the combat as much as the original.
[0:59:31] <%depotagents> god i wanna play this so fucking bad AAAGHH
[0:59:33] <+preppyposs> Thats right pat
[0:59:34] <+ShotgunJesus> pipe best weapon
[0:59:40] <+ShotgunJesus> I wonder if spears will be OP again
[0:59:43] <%BestTeaMaker> @PatStaresAt how does combat feel?
[0:59:43] <umbraawitch> @ShinobiPhoenix this chat is like that sometimes
[0:59:44] <GeltonZ> @hephep_311 Not broken enough
[0:59:44] <%Valdorick> Meaty damage
[0:59:46] <TheRealNumberJ42> man this gameplay seems so much smoother think i might pick this up
[0:59:47] <Savior127> Is it me or is the music drowning out every other sound in the game?
[0:59:49] <nmaten> @GeltonZ that has to be bait
[0:59:49] <illusiveSaint> i am just learning about this game what a confusing title
[0:59:49] <%VioletHeart> @ShinobiPhoenix The tech in Automata quite literally functions off of magic.
[0:59:51] <%bevyrage> dude the mini-map is so damn solid too
[0:59:51] <SlangPunk> @mendin Huh that's interesting, makes sense not to lean on the magic as it's fucked everything up
[0:59:54] <OneThousandTomatoes> taura?
[0:59:54] <iamtheTwitchghost> i can tell just by watching
[0:59:55] <CosmoSire> @GeltonZ I loved projectiles, but the rest was real bad
[0:59:56] <Byorski> It just LOOKS like it feels so much better
[1:00:00] <%AzureGale> More fluid and responsive?
[1:00:00] <GeltonZ> @nmaten Nope. I'm serious.
[1:00:01] <%BoxNavy> the combat feels so nice and heavy i love it
[1:00:03] <%NitronStreams> Looks a lot smoother
[1:00:05] <+preppyposs> this kid is fuckin limber
[1:00:05] <TioXyco> it's much more fluid than the original
[1:00:08] <SulfurousAcid> I didn't mind the original ;_;
[1:00:08] <Basch71> it's like night and day
[1:00:10] <%Monkeyweed21> they washed off the Cavia stink
[1:00:11] <%bootsjay> did they rework the combat animations
[1:00:12] <%ssjklyco> I can't remember as it's been 10 years for me
[1:00:12] <%athuramn> because it's not a clunky heap of garbage art @patstaresat
[1:00:13] <$Ziegsy> @geltonz I hated the combat in tomato, so I turned it into a shooter with sword lasers
[1:00:14] <MonoReaper> @ShinobiPhoenix Oh yeah and Emils literally presence in autoamta is basically magic as well because he is a magic weapon
[1:00:14] <+RowenCleric> doesnt feel as good as drakengard 1
[1:00:17] <DarknessD42> The framerate doesn't die for once
[1:00:18] <penitentpendant> "Semi-functional"
[1:00:18] <vapidq> yeah the animations seem very fluid, like automata
[1:00:20] <Ryutaryi> The fact that you can move while casting magic is great
[1:00:20] <+ShotgunJesus> Nier had effed up sound mixing IMO
[1:00:20] <%Aeogard> combat wasnt bad pat, it was perfectly servicable for what it was
[1:00:20] <GeltonZ> I had fun fighting
[1:00:23] <%Monkeyweed21> MEDIOCRE
[1:00:28] <TheRealNumberJ42> i had fun once i got the phoenix spear :P
[1:00:28] <+preppyposs> that animation feels incredibly good for some reason
[1:00:28] <+loukemia83> did they redo the whole game in the Automata engine?
[1:00:30] <Overhaul180> This is so specific but HC Bailey once did an April Fools episode of this game and ended just after this scene and it RUINED ME lol; I was so intrigued by what was going on and synopsis didn't do the story justice
[1:00:33] <Profmcstevie> For a game with so much combat, it was nuts Nier was at the quality it had for combat
[1:00:33] <twohitgood> it's better animations and has good hit(stop? stun?). makes the fhuts feel meaty.
[1:00:38] <brachydios777> Original Nier combat was meh not bad it looks
[1:00:43] <Overhaul180> When Pat and Liam did a proper LP I was so happy
[1:00:44] <Broken_Sonex> @GeltonZ Alright your opinion means nothing then
[1:00:45] <+TheotherKristian> It's not a PlatinumGames, but it's good enough for me
[1:00:50] <%Dakuu75> So, lore-wise this is human nier and his sister, then later its the replicants? And shades are human souls, yeah?
[1:00:51] <+ShotgunJesus> I actually really loved the feedback on hits in the original
[1:00:51] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:00:52] <thedrunkenmerchant> It was same spear combos + charging fists/Spears. that was all OGs combat
[1:00:53] <Vertigheist> Can’t imagine going back to the old crusty gameplay
[1:00:54] <JetpackMcQuack> I’ll settle for finished
[1:00:56] <+ryujinran> big levels ups
[1:00:58] <GeltonZ> @Broken_Sonex I get that a lot.
[1:01:00] <%the22cstomp> wow pat you're leveling up fast :)
[1:01:07] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat and Liam teamed up for the WEIRDEST shit
[1:01:08] <%Valdorick> Wow, Already level 30, I guess the level cap is like, 9999 yeah? Kappa
[1:01:09] <Mr_JustinJones> Wow 30 levels!! How nice
[1:01:10] <%illusiveSaint> i never enjoyed nier 1 that i didn't care for automata i still don't understand why people like it
[1:01:14] <jcflyguy> Yeeeeeeah I might drop to Normal, those things take 3-4 tries to break on hard
[1:01:19] <42nfl19> Is it to keep you IN or OUT? @PatStaresAt
[1:01:19] <Tonuha> @Dakuu75 correct
[1:01:20] <%AzureGale> Oh don't roll in that
[1:01:21] <RWLJr98> Just climb it 4Head
[1:01:21] <Broken_Sonex> @GeltonZ As you should
[1:01:21] <%LaughingCatt> ah yes, just your average post-apocaltypic winter
[1:01:22] <%ssjklyco> Full quarantine gear
[1:01:22] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt wheres his facemask/gasmask tho
[1:01:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> the same wouldn't make it cold would it
[1:01:24] <blue8moon> well the sky does appear to be blocked out, so no sunlight LUL
[1:01:25] <SulfurousAcid> this boi can move
[1:01:26] <$Ziegsy> I feel sorry for people who came here not wanting spoilers
[1:01:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> salt*
[1:01:27] <cardamomo88> maybe is cold salt
[1:01:28] <cheapdoc> it shouldn't be that cold
[1:01:28] <MonoReaper> Yonah Q_Q
[1:01:29] <%valriot> But Pat, its summer :)
[1:01:30] <+Gespens> because DONT TOUCH THE SNOW
[1:01:33] <%caramelatte1> So this looks like the result of drakengard ?
[1:01:34] <mr_saturday93> Wall of jericho
[1:01:35] <CosmoSire> Blood trails remain D:
[1:01:35] <Vertigheist> @illusivesaint just isn’t for you I guess
[1:01:36] <%BestTeaMaker> @illusiveSaint it has fun combat, good characters, and a good story
[1:01:37] <+megaman_sentinel> Put that cookie down
[1:01:38] <JetpackMcQuack> Dont touch me
[1:01:38] <Mexrage> OG NieR combat didn't got in the way of the rest of the game, it isn't deadly premonition
[1:01:42] <karl_rex> So is the other book Rubrum?
[1:01:43] <Byorski> That cough is absurdly pathetic, though
[1:01:44] <%za7az> Shouldn't that "snow" be killing our main character?
[1:01:44] <brachydios777> I would love a dlc that gave you the gestalt variant of the story
[1:01:46] <$Ziegsy> @onethousandtomatoes if it blocked the sun, then yeah
[1:01:48] <%Mendin> @caramelatte1 Explicitly

[1:03:20] <RWLJr98> @flexin_apex I know right? So dumb
[1:03:22] <Mexrage> i wonder, just like there are copies of noir, are there copies of weiss and the other grimmoire
[1:03:23] <%za7az> @Monkeyweed21 OH YEAH PogChamp
[1:03:24] <MonoReaper> Curse Noir for baiting Yonah into the project
[1:03:24] <Ciglossonjr> It’s noir isnt it
[1:03:24] <%TimetodiveLTX> OUENDAAAAAANNN!!!!
[1:03:26] <%weissguard> Noir: lol, gottem
[1:03:27] <%AncelDeLambert> so, is the tone of these games meant to be overwhelming depression?
[1:03:32] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> rubrum needed more love
[1:03:40] <Alfred_Waaghur> That was the idea haha
[1:03:41] <vapidq> @AncelDeLambert sort of
[1:03:42] <%depotagents> tbh I don't think nier's lore is.. that good, honestly, but it's certainly compelling
[1:03:42] <%RetroCop87> show us the queen's corpse
[1:03:42] <%AzureGale> @AncelDeLambert Yeah
[1:03:43] <%bootsjay> same pat
[1:03:44] <rufus2k2> @AncelDeLambert no but yes
[1:03:44] <%athuramn> @anceldelambert hell yeah
[1:03:44] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt Was the wall to keep them In or Out?
[1:03:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @AncelDeLambert thats correct
[1:03:47] <%MisterRockett> As they expect you to.
[1:03:49] <olm46> Rubrum is wasted potential
[1:03:51] <Jontman42> Okabe <3
[1:03:52] <+ninja_galt> I liked the soundtrack from the last game
[1:03:54] <MonoReaper> @Mexrage Hamelin created mass produced version but Weiss/Noir are unique
[1:03:55] <QuasarKnightGaming> Noir granted her wish for food for the both of them.
[1:03:56] <GeltonZ> @PatStaresAt When you get a chance can you please try to roll in the air?
[1:03:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think thats commen, people forget about the opening as they play
[1:03:59] <Man_in_the_Red> @anceldelambert no thats drakengard when you play it, this is more tragedy
[1:04:00] <Profmcstevie> Until you get past the twins, it just sits in the back of your mind
[1:04:00] <%solracc25> do not touch the EvIl book.
[1:04:04] <%Valdorick> I wouldn't say overwhelming depression... just not escapism fantasy happy land.
[1:04:05] <%AzureGale> World's fcked
[1:04:06] <%barkon345> @AncelDeLambert overwelming depression is kind of Yoko Taro's thing
[1:04:08] <a_mad_dragon_> all dat PJSalt
[1:04:09] <%solracc25> Must touch book
[1:04:09] <mai_cu> that tower doesnt have the same impact
[1:04:13] <SlangPunk> @anceldelambert Yeah, with some existential ism as a treat
[1:04:14] <kingdinkyI> The rubrum stuff is big sad
[1:04:15] <+flexin_apex> The cookieeeee....
[1:04:15] <%Axellogic> She wave
[1:04:17] <NekoUrabe> Time jump time
[1:04:18] <%RetroCop87> I wonder if they'll try to incorporate rubrum's backstory in the game
[1:04:20] <amonimis> just a casual small time skip
[1:04:20] <Savior127> wait was that the tower the dragon fell on?
[1:04:22] <mai_cu> as tokyo tower
[1:04:22] <Ciglossonjr> Thats not tokyo tower

[1:06:17] <olm46> Strongest child alive
[1:06:17] <+megaman_sentinel> what's the point of having money in this world lol
[1:06:17] <auraoftheearth009> This is much smoother than the original
[1:06:17] <nmaten> that is thee zelda chicken sound effect
[1:06:17] <CosmoSire> Styles of beyond
[1:06:18] <%Fooguwu> zelda-ass cuckoo sound lol
[1:06:21] <RWLJr98> Did he talk about the MK movie? I wasn’t too into it, curious on what he thinks.
[1:06:21] <gecomaman> Air dash is short
[1:06:22] <%ramielthe5th> where are the flying weapoms?
[1:06:24] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Do western people think that siblings not hating each other is incest?
[1:06:25] <%Monkeyweed21> aww they got rid of the goofy ass double jump
[1:06:25] <rufus2k2> @ringabal he's a jrpg protagonist, comes with the territory
[1:06:27] <+ShotgunJesus> I don't like Popola and Devola and I feel alone in this haha
[1:06:28] <ToneBacas> hot
[1:06:28] <+JJsAdventure> uh huh
[1:06:29] <%BigDumBeak> there are rolling attacks too!
[1:06:31] <GeltonZ> @Valdorick The original had air dodges, but they were a roll. It's an air roll.
[1:06:31] <OneThousandTomatoes> kill the chicken coward
[1:06:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> OOOOHHH LETS GO
[1:06:34] <%JoshManVGH> Atial combo!
[1:06:34] <%radda343> this feels like SE didn't want to pay Platinum to do this
[1:06:36] <brunoberserk> god , the game plays so MUCH better than the original nier
[1:06:38] <%athuramn> from all those years he spent practicing sick combos
[1:06:40] <brachydios777> @umbraawitch Wait, are you saying you didn’t know?
[1:06:42] <+ShotgunJesus> I wonder if you still fall on your ass
[1:06:42] <Byorski> It kinda goes without saying, but FUCK PHYSICS
[1:06:47] <SulfurousAcid> go talk to the girls
[1:06:48] <$Ziegsy> no more crotch jumping ;;
[1:06:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> launcher into Helmsplitter is problem solver!
[1:06:50] <+TheKeysmash> if you have the automata weapons i think you can switch to them now
[1:06:50] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt There's some different hold moves depending on what part of the combo you're in, like he has a forward stab
[1:06:50] <CosmoSire> Nice blur effects
[1:06:50] <QuasarKnightGaming> I think there’s rolling attacks too
[1:06:51] <%Treuan> Tautopolis
[1:06:53] <%thelaxinator> Why does this random child hair AIR COMBOS
[1:06:53] <LoneFonte> Yeah
[1:06:53] <peyodogo> man the popola version of song of the ancients sounded weird, is that an effect when you're in your house or is the song just like that now?
[1:06:54] <TheRealNumberJ42> they kept the shitty fence
[1:06:54] <umbraawitch> @brachydios777 no i just dont get your comment
[1:06:54] <josh813318> WHEN"S FISHING?
[1:06:54] <LordOfThePoultry> @PatStaresAt are you gonna be grinding for weapons?
[1:06:55] <cardamomo88> farming simulator
[1:06:55] <%BoxNavy> yeah it looks so dream-like
[1:06:58] <artoflec> bleached japan
[1:06:58] <%Vextalyst> you can get more dialogue out of yonah
[1:06:58] <theladygrayson> You aren't alone @shotgunjesus
[1:06:59] <%za7az> @zanzibar_junker It's harder to write it in a compelling way. Also just less relatable.
[1:07:00] <TioXyco> there's also a run strike @PatStaresAt
[1:07:01] <stukamod> Looks foggy
[1:07:02] <cheapdoc> but they turned down the bloom, which is good
[1:07:06] <xinexes> when do we get to PAPA NieR
[1:07:06] <NekoUrabe> infinite sun will do that
[1:07:07] <+fetrigon> painterly ye
[1:07:07] <rufus2k2> attack the chicken!
[1:07:09] <$Ziegsy> Oh yeah pat check yer weapons
[1:07:09] <%LaughingCatt> Its bleached but without the eye-searing amounts of bloom effects
[1:07:12] <%Aeogard> Turning your brightness down makes it look nicer imo
[1:07:13] <twohitgood> the bleached look is great so long as it doesn't blind me at that one spot.
[1:07:16] <+ShotgunJesus> @theladygrayson thank
[1:07:20] <%athuramn> is it hold or delay
[1:07:20] <%illusiveSaint> aren't you supposed to play some old buff guy or is that something else?
[1:07:21] <+Dorf1> finally a ps3 era remake that doesnt completly nuke the mood lighting
[1:07:21] <+fetrigon> like water colory
[1:07:22] <$Ziegsy> @xinexes the dlc post game
[1:07:22] <Ubu2933> looks like a water colour poainting made realistic I dig it makes it very striking in how washed out it looks
[1:07:23] <%NitronStreams> It isnow my headcanon the original Neir's combat was clunky cuz you were playing as a stiff old man
[1:07:27] <Kenyuki4> @zanzibar_junker I understand you, but Japan loves leaning into the incest part alot
[1:07:28] <Savior127> @PatStaresAt go to the cave that leads to heaven so see just how BLEACHED it really is lol
[1:07:29] <+itsgundamu> I know sprinting and doing an attack is different
[1:07:29] <MKII> I didnt find any different holds. maybe with another weapon?
[1:07:30] <trickster721> Imagine, as remake NOT totally screwing up the art style
[1:07:35] <GeltonZ> @illusiveSaint That's the 360 version
[1:07:39] <Mr_JustinJones> Haha fooled you
[1:07:41] <%thelaxinator> If I didn't skip PE would I have learned my high-time to roulette combo?
[1:07:41] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> everything looks dreamlike but also drained of life, it's cool
[1:07:42] <auraoftheearth009> Love the music from this game
[1:07:42] <VidulaSaix> There's definitely way more but I havent figured out how Ive been doing them. I think some just require enemies
[1:07:42] <+preppyposs> HOW BIG IS THAT MAILBOX
[1:07:44] <+Zanzibar_Junker> But I actually like my family though
[1:07:47] <$Ziegsy> pat needs to check weapons for feels
[1:07:49] <TheRealNumberJ42> im surprised so many people don't know what replicant is
[1:07:49] <RWLJr98> April fools

[1:08:08] <FoxInABeret> @zanzibar_junker No, but the Japanese trope of obsessively protecting and caring for your little sister isn't something that really plays in the West. Most siblings in Western societies have a more balanced dynamic.

[1:08:47] <%baronouroboros> smooching
[1:08:50] <IndoorSitup> Why did Pat spell Nier's name so weird??
[1:08:50] <LorcaNomad> For lore reasons
[1:08:51] <brachydios777> *stream
[1:08:53] <cardamomo88> the world is fuck
[1:08:53] <%KineticZen> Oh so we're in the First
[1:08:54] <%Agami23> god thats the dumbest thing
[1:08:55] <%Mendin> Sun broken
[1:08:55] <+itsgundamu> yea thats fucked
[1:08:55] <%thelaxinator> Didn't the sun canonically stop in the sky?
[1:08:56] <+ReallyBigRocks> It has a day-day cycle
[1:08:56] <%VioletHeart> It's always daytime because of reasons too.
[1:08:56] <%BoxNavy> it has a day and overcast cycle
[1:08:57] <Overhaul180> Wonder if they'll make reference to Brother Nier's, uh, efforts to make money
[1:08:59] <brunoberserk> THE MOON IS A LIE
[1:08:59] <%Vextalyst> ok maybe only important characters have multiple dialogue
[1:08:59] <Goraka91> @depotagents ''Oh cool it's Popola from Automata, I thought she died though''
[1:09:01] <+warlockwithapixie> Yeah, the mailbox save!
[1:09:02] <vapidq> isn't that like mentioned in universe?
[1:09:03] <F_manS> I wonder why? Kappa
[1:09:05] <Mexrage> gotta slay the lightwarden to make it night time
[1:09:05] <AllenDeadman> world is so hyper fucked....
[1:09:07] <%sporeian94> but WHY
[1:09:09] <NekoUrabe> Everything is voiced now too
[1:09:10] <VidulaSaix> Chat I want you to keep your ear out and tell me how many Makoto's you hear in the village LUL
[1:09:11] <%Treuan> We don't make the rules here
[1:09:12] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt it's lowercase in his name, though
[1:09:12] <%AzureGale> Time 2 rotate saves
[1:09:13] <IndoorSitup> But his name isn't
[1:09:13] <%Valdorick> It auto set the name to that too.
[1:09:14] <olm46> Always thought the game's R is capitalized to differentiate between the two.
[1:09:14] <TioXyco> it's capitalised for style tho
[1:09:15] <+Raspada_Ryner> Is  he playing on the PS5?
[1:09:17] <%Agami23> i wonder why the R is capitalized
[1:09:18] <he1lhydra> that save 01 is vibrating HARD
[1:09:18] <karovus> thats how its always been spelled
[1:09:20] <Broken_Sonex> ALSO IT LOOKS COOL SHUT UP
[1:09:20] <+preppyposs> why is the save number violently shaking os much
[1:09:20] <%pilgrimsayswhat> BECAUSE JAPAN

[1:09:28] <%miguelrod777> Kreygasm
[1:09:28] <+TenguGemini> apparently the character is not canonically named nier, he is The Protagonist
[1:09:29] <VidulaSaix> DEVOLA <3
[1:09:29] <cheapdoc> Considering it doesn't have a daynight cycle, it makes me think that something happened with the rotation
[1:09:30] <%NitronStreams> THE SOOOOOONG
[1:09:30] <+GameFreakerZero> His name isn't Nier tho it's Mr Protagonist
[1:09:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> AngelThump

[1:09:35] <+critikal_bit> OH YEAH BABY
[1:09:36] <%Mendin> @IndoorSitup The original prototype of the game was something like N i E R and was actually an acronym
[1:09:37] <devanmuse> Given all the post apocalyptic lore behind this story, is it ever explained why it's always daytime? How does the planet just stop rotating?
[1:09:38] <%walternatorz> FFXIV Raid Music

[1:14:20] <mass1997> Was that ash ketcham?
[1:14:20] <%NitronStreams> You contaminated the Timeline
[1:14:22] <EynosStyles> Why do games think that a modern society will literally go back to the middle ages. we wouldn't lose all are technological advances. we have books that explains how to make electricity.
[1:14:24] <%the22cstomp> cheater D:
[1:14:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> and they are STRONGER
[1:14:26] <UTaken34> time to crate
[1:14:28] <RWLJr98> Cheater!
[1:14:28] <majindusto> TIME PARADOX
[1:14:29] <+preppyposs> "hey yonah check out these cool swords I found"
[1:14:29] <%the22cstomp> oh wait nevermind not cheater
[1:14:29] <+silvery_cricket> literally scraping the edge of that crate
[1:14:31] <%Valdorick> But do the DLC weapons need to be fully upgraded for the thing?
[1:14:33] <Kenyuki4> Your just 9S now
[1:14:33] <rufus2k2> SELL THEM FOR MONEY
[1:14:34] <danknugglit> Coward
[1:14:41] <2DSuperiority> time to kill lore
[1:14:46] <$Ziegsy> @valdorick nah
[1:14:48] <%czeekytv> @EynosStyles they can't read the language for one
[1:14:49] <UTaken34> Probably not, valdorick
[1:14:49] <+JJsAdventure> 9s is him
[1:14:49] <CosmoSire> @EynosStyles Books burned, now what?
[1:14:50] <+thehollow89> is Pat playing the ps4/ps5 version or PC?
[1:14:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> @eynosstyles do you know this games lore?
[1:14:52] <NekoUrabe> Eff that Beastbain
[1:14:54] <%AlteisenReiseZ> I wonder if they fixed the FISHING issue.
[1:14:56] <%AzureGale> fair
[1:14:57] <%13ry4n93> crate genocide, time!
[1:14:59] <%Arweynn> So question becomes since when did he meet Accord
[1:15:01] <UTaken34> PS5
[1:15:02] <%Ranryu692> @EynosStyles that requires the ability to read
[1:15:02] <%athuramn> ps5
[1:15:02] <%ringabal> Once again, the cubes provide generosity
[1:15:03] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @thehollow89 ps4/5
[1:15:05] <$Ziegsy> @thehollow89 ps5
[1:15:07] <%miguelrod777> he's a speedy boy
[1:15:08] <Ryutaryi> There never was a fishing issue
[1:15:11] <%ShinobiPhoenix> fuck all that, I am totally using 2B's sword because I love her
[1:15:14] <SulfurousAcid> there was NOTHING wrong with fishing Kappa
[1:15:15] <cardamomo88> SabaPing SabaPing Kappa
[1:15:16] <%radda343> there was no issue, justin was just dumb
[1:15:17] <chaosjoey> the fishing problem made me quit my first playthrough
[1:15:18] <%thetunnelhomer> I love everything about this game EXCEPT Onier-chan
[1:15:18] <rufus2k2> IF I WAS A RICH MAN
[1:15:23] <%toastybites> dude shes like right there
[1:15:24] <Ryutaryi> It literally shows you where to fish when it asks you to
[1:15:26] <trickster721> She can hear you, dude
[1:15:30] <auraoftheearth009> Kamakami?
[1:15:31] <%UvBenServed> Doubt
[1:15:31] <%pilgrimsayswhat> thanks Michelle Ruff
[1:15:32] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Sorry, I meant the Journalist filter.
[1:15:35] <cheapdoc> What is rich in this post apocalyptic medieval society?
[1:15:35] <%Mendin> They explicitly fixed the fishing thing, that fisherman says "HEY SO DONT FISH HERE BY THE WAY"
[1:15:35] <+silvery_cricket> Man I wish the protag was a melting old man in his 40's
[1:15:37] <+Dorf1> the fishing issue was the mbmbam guy not being able to read
[1:15:38] <%ShinobiPhoenix> what even IS rich in a world like this
[1:15:40] <%13ry4n93> wholesome
[1:15:41] <+GameFreakerZero> Think I saw something on twitter that they added a line telling you where to go to fish
[1:15:43] <BerryliciousDefinition> <3
[1:15:44] <EynosStyles> @czeekytv we would lose our ability to read in a hundred years. People would still teach their kids and stuff
[1:15:45] <RWLJr98> Kappa ?
[1:15:47] <Profmcstevie> I could always be richer
[1:15:51] <$Ziegsy> the automata weapons are slower, so its not cheating as such
[1:15:51] <cardamomo88> SPEEEDDD
[1:15:52] <penitentpendant> Oh hey, they DID add an ending E
[1:15:54] <%valriot> @valriot Cant remember where exactly, but Nier apparently is so desperate for money to save keep Yonah healthy, he'll do everrrrrything, its kinda fucked
[1:15:55] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> you can tell a lot of reviewers quit around the fishing bit 2 hours in
[1:15:57] <+preppyposs> OH THATS RIGHT
[1:15:58] <NeutrinoInteraction> I want my protagonist to look like a huge unfuckable ogre, dammit
[1:15:59] <MKII> is the music distorting
[1:16:01] <%Valdorick> Its a Taro game, his story arc is going to be he either dies later, or sells his body to other men and doesn't see her as often.
[1:16:03] <SulfurousAcid> you forgot about the flowers that grow in real time?
[1:16:03] <%BoxNavy> brother nier grew on me so much cus of this game. hes cute :)
[1:16:06] <%13ry4n93> Papa Nier is best Nier
[1:16:07] <rufus2k2> IS THAT ROGER CRAIG SMITH
[1:16:09] <NekoUrabe> I loved the April fools trailer
[1:16:10] <majindusto> Melting? WHAT?
[1:16:14] <rufus2k2> Chris Dam Redfield
[1:16:14] <tattleworm> gotta grow yourself a lunar tear
[1:16:15] <%Treuan> I am the meatman, my meat is delicious
[1:16:16] <%athuramn> ahh I love the village of 5 voice actors
[1:16:17] <Sturmley> Is the combat better in this version?
[1:16:20] <+preppyposs> PAPA NIER?
[1:16:21] <LorcaNomad> Hey matt
[1:16:22] <kapitankolin> at the very least, it's interesting that he's actually a *child*
[1:16:22] <%Fooguwu> Papa nier?
[1:16:22] <%ChestMimik> ITS HIM
[1:16:23] <iosephe> Is it?
[1:16:23] <+preppyposs> FATHER
[1:16:23] <Jontman42> another Mercer?
[1:16:23] <SulfurousAcid> one of the side quests requires gardening iirc
[1:16:23] <+silvery_cricket> When I look at Nier I want to think "How did that man ever find a woman to fuck him"
[1:16:25] <nmaten> is that dad?
[1:16:25] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh hey, that's Papa Nier
[1:16:25] <+itsgundamu> WHAT
[1:16:25] <auraoftheearth009> Papa Neir!
[1:16:26] <%linSP> papa?
[1:16:26] <lemon_lover28> has he activated NieR mode yet?
[1:16:26] <%cvp5127> no
[1:16:26] <cardamomo88> PAPA??
[1:16:26] <+glgzephyr> Hi Matt

[1:16:36] <+JJsAdventure> lol
[1:16:37] <+glgzephyr> that's Matt Mercer again
[1:16:37] <thelonechris> Seeing this when your first experience with Nier was Automata is a trip
[1:16:39] <%pilgrimsayswhat> thats a matt mercer
[1:16:40] <Jontman42> I swear half of these are Mercer
[1:16:40] <AllenDeadman> wait no, it's not him
[1:16:41] <BerryliciousDefinition> Dad????
[1:16:42] <%superc37> DAD
[1:16:42] <%czeekytv> @EynosStyles it's been 1,400 years lol. Also the concept of "teaching your kids" is a bit... convoluted in this world
[1:16:46] <%Kurokoi64> Dude, Matt Mercer has already voiced liek 4 people youve spoken to
[1:16:46] <%pilgrimsayswhat> thats a matt mercer too
[1:16:49] <+Zanzibar_Junker> It's Majima
[1:16:49] <fimbulvetr27> There's another Matt Mercer
[1:16:51] <AllenDeadman> it's Matt
[1:16:51] <Jontman42> THAT could be Mercer too
[1:16:53] <battlexqueen> I swear most of these men have been matt mercer
[1:16:53] <ammobasket> HMMMMM
[1:16:54] <%Puhff> ores, you say?
[1:16:55] <FoxInABeret> Hello Matt Mercer #5
[1:17:00] <NeutrinoInteraction> Just assume every male in the game that isn't a party member is Matt Mercer
[1:17:01] <%Puhff> to shreds, you say?
[1:17:04] <$Afterman_> there is a lot of critical role
[1:17:04] <+glgzephyr> @Jontman42 You'd be wrong, there's actually around seven
[1:17:05] <%AzureGale> That's also Matt Mercer
[1:17:07] <$Afterman_> theres like THREE sam reigels
[1:17:09] <Silly_Duckling> Most npc's are mercer, this is just critical role Kappa
[1:17:09] <+preppyposs> Is that paige? shes walking iwht a cane and says howdy
[1:17:10] <+glgzephyr> just in this village
[1:17:10] <RWLJr98> Find Kojima
[1:17:13] <penitentpendant> @SlangPunk I always appreciate when a remake has more content, especially story centric stuff
[1:17:13] <%Nuclearcherries> What is this, Skyrim!?
[1:17:17] <%Fooguwu> "cum"
[1:17:18] <%AzureGale> Just assume Matt Mercer voices everyone in this game
[1:17:18] <Sturmley> That lady is Matt Mercer too
[1:17:18] <%BoxNavy> cum
[1:17:21] <%pilgrimsayswhat> sam doing voices is hilarious to me
[1:17:23] <stukamod> Cum
[1:17:25] <%FallenAngelSC2> Random NPC during conversation with other NPC: "Mind if I put my tits in your view?"
[1:17:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I wish ProZD could get on this too if he isn't already
[1:17:27] <+glgzephyr> And yes, there are at least three sam reigels
[1:17:30] <Tonicky > Unusual Oars
[1:17:34] <+glgzephyr> there's sam again
[1:17:36] <%TimetodiveLTX> nice dog
[1:17:36] <%AzureGale> You cannot pet the dog in Nier
[1:17:36] <%linSP> dog stuck!
[1:17:38] <SulfurousAcid> you can't pet the dog kaiSad
[1:17:40] <TheRealNumberJ42> D:
[1:17:41] <EynosStyles> @czeekytv Yes. I am aware of the year. however, to say humans will forget everything is ridiculous thou
[1:17:45] <olm46> But did you know about Popola?
[1:17:45] <%BoxNavy> his shirt monkaS
[1:17:47] <LorcaNomad> is it circle as talk cuz Japanese game?
[1:17:49] <RWLJr98> Reddit is fuming
[1:17:49] <+Kyma1020> I wouldn't be surprised that half the town's men are voiced by Mercer. He voices alot of npcs as a DM
[1:17:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> the replicant production facilities are reusing those vocal cord
[1:17:52] <%13ry4n93> so what's the difference between this version and the old one? Is it just a graphical update?
[1:17:54] <%Mendin> Was that medicine dog?
[1:17:56] <cardamomo88> PLUS
[1:17:57] <ammobasket> Matt Mercer Reacts to Pat Trying to Identify Matt Mercer
[1:17:59] <%athuramn> I mean "fully voice acted" can mean fully voiced by 3 people lol
[1:18:05] <%BoxNavy> that kid sounds like 20
[1:18:06] <NekoUrabe> Paige
[1:18:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> the known history that NONE OF YOU CAN READ
[1:18:06] <+itsgundamu> Mood
[1:18:08] <SomeAsianDood> Wait that's Ann
[1:18:09] <thelonechris> Shut the fuck up about Popola
[1:18:10] <SlangPunk> @penitentpendant Oh yeah for sure, just I'm not sure many people have learnt about it yet so it'd be good to keep the suprise
[1:18:10] <Kalarchis> DOG
[1:18:10] <%Puhff> NO RESTRAINT
[1:18:11] <gecomaman> Leonie!
[1:18:13] <%Valdorick> Town music is soothingly slapping.

[1:18:16] <+preppyposs> hello mr mercer again
[1:18:18] <cheapdoc> Matt mercer number infinity
[1:18:24] <+silvery_cricket> I wished this child was voiced by DAN GREEN
[1:18:24] <+preppyposs> COSTUME
[1:18:26] <+ShotgunJesus> Popola? she a butt head
[1:18:30] <penitentpendant> As long as we don't have a conversation of Matt Mercer against Matt Mercer
[1:18:32] <+itsgundamu> BEASTBAIN
[1:18:35] <cheapdoc> no, that was laura probably
[1:18:35] <%czeekytv> @EynosStyles my point is that it's less "forget" and more "lose" in this universe, you'd know that if you played/watched the game
[1:18:35] <+glgzephyr> that may actually have been Ashley Johnson
[1:18:36] <%BoxNavy> hes right
[1:18:37] <%TimetodiveLTX> never ever
[1:18:38] <SulfurousAcid> Not once
[1:18:38] <AllenDeadman> EVER

[1:22:06] <%walternatorz> is the audio supposed to be distorted in this area?

[1:22:34] <%athuramn> popola such an asshole for making ONE person organize that shit
[1:22:34] <VidulaSaix> Yes

[1:22:36] <+glgzephyr> SHE'S GREAT
[1:22:38] <%pilgrimsayswhat> jokes on you i cant fucking READ
[1:22:42] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt if you don't know how to read, why would you go to a library?
[1:22:50] <%ringabal> Oh no, anime sickness
[1:22:50] <Byorski> 1400 years later and she STILL has the cough
[1:22:53] <Parapattern> She's just a dogshit little sister
[1:22:58] <+ShotgunJesus> anyeays
[1:23:02] <yourliteraldog> @Kalarchis  True my sisters still treat me as a child and I'm 25

[1:23:15] <%linSP> dying sickness
[1:23:15] <%ChestMimik> Man this feels SO different than Papa Nier
[1:23:15] <+silvery_cricket> anime sickness
[1:23:15] <%ringabal> aaaaaaaanimeeeeee
[1:23:16] <%13ry4n93> is it just consumption or something?
[1:23:16] <SomeAsianDood> Anime wasting sickness
[1:23:17] <%czeekytv> Wait how does Yohna learn how to read this stuff
[1:23:18] <TheRealNumberJ42> anime aids
[1:23:18] <%walternatorz> Plot sickness
[1:23:19] <olm46> His sister warranty's out of date after 1400 years.
[1:23:19] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:23:21] <brunoberserk> i am feeling a '' ARA ARA '' energy from popola
[1:23:22] <Broken_Sonex> BIG ANIME ILNESS
[1:23:23] <%depotagents> I did always like popola's voice acting
[1:23:24] <%shurtal> Distinct from anime mom sickness
[1:23:24] <%UvBenServed> THE WORST KIND
[1:23:24] <cardamomo88> ORPHAN SICKNESS
[1:23:24] <nmaten> the SCRAWL
[1:23:26] <%Pappajimbo> the most deadly
[1:23:26] <+silvery_cricket> A light cough that will kill her at a sad time
[1:23:26] <%BoxNavy> is that worse than anime mom disease
[1:23:26] <stukamod> The worst kind
[1:23:26] <Silly_Duckling> It's an offshoot of anime mom sickness
[1:23:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> murder ALL SHEEP
[1:23:29] <%athuramn> the one that gets passed down from whoever dates mason
[1:23:29] <%13ry4n93> ah that sickness
[1:23:29] <xinexes> DEATH SICKNESS
[1:23:30] <penitentpendant> Not to be confused with Anime Mother Sickness, which is usually more fatal
[1:23:32] <%DamnFineCupofStreaming> plot sickness
[1:23:32] <%Valdorick> Mega Cancer, to be exact.
[1:23:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> sheep will sleep if you become fatigued
[1:23:34] <Jontman42> probably tuberculosis
[1:23:37] <nevan_44> oh god..... not the anime child sickness.......
[1:23:37] <%JoshManVGH> Great Tattoo sickness
[1:23:37] <majindusto> Devola  and Popola...Finally  with Red hair and not the weird Brown  hair  from  the original
[1:23:38] <%MisterRockett> Pat that's super not true she actually has a magic illness.
[1:23:39] <%Agami23> what, tuberculosis?
[1:23:41] <trickster721> Dickensian gimpy leg disease
[1:23:41] <+silvery_cricket> What good would money be they dont do trade?
[1:23:42] <%KineticZen> I'm changing my answer to Devola, I got them mixed up
[1:23:43] <battlexqueen> Very different from anime mom ssickness
[1:23:45] <nmaten> its her stand killing her
[1:23:45] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @brunoberserk bonk
[1:23:47] <vonmaultke> If anime sickness breaks out in the real world we're all fucked
[1:23:47] <EynosStyles> New twist Yonah is faking lol
[1:23:49] <yourliteraldog> The anime sickness that makes you frail but bangable
[1:23:49] <%Ranryu692> what a bitch
[1:23:49] <SulfurousAcid> complex tuberculosis
[1:23:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> buy me herbs or I will take any of the ones you found!
[1:23:52] <+glgzephyr> in fact, you may want to just get ten wool now while the sheep are plentiful
[1:23:54] <%13ry4n93> she's such a sweetie
[1:23:55] <%linSP> thanks popo
[1:23:57] <stukamod> Not the BLOOD CANCER
[1:23:59] <danknugglit> Mission passed      +Respect

[1:26:52] <devanmuse> Very nice for this... 3 dozen people?
[1:26:52] <TheSphereHunter> yea especially when you get to the ocean side village, that place is poppin!
[1:26:52] <%13ry4n93> it's a slow apocalypse
[1:26:52] <Jontman42> the liebarbie

[1:26:57] <yourliteraldog> Gentle slow death
[1:26:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah, but the bleached part helps
[1:26:58] <%athuramn> it's weird how good the place is for how horribly wrecked it gets
[1:27:00] <%hamborgini> make sure to eat your medicinal herberts
[1:27:02] <rosemon5001> just incase look up into the sky
[1:27:03] <Silly_Duckling> More of a "return to nature before 'humans'" sort of vibe
[1:27:04] <$BlackMage66652> I'm still mad Papa Nier didn't get remade
[1:27:06] <%AzureGale> Nature is reclaiming the world
[1:27:08] <RWLJr98> .....
[1:27:08] <sosuke5> Make sure to get extra mutton for a quest later
[1:27:11] <%za7az> @EynosStyles That's the sad part
[1:27:12] <%13ry4n93> like how dying from hypothermia  there's this moment of warmth
[1:27:12] <%linSP> this music loop is getting to me
[1:27:14] <pixelkenj> why do we live so far away from everyone else
[1:27:16] <+AWanderingKenku> So what're the odds for crazy new Taro-shit being in this remake?
[1:27:16] <+JJsAdventure> Papa nier: im only one man
[1:27:19] <Alfred_Waaghur> This fantasy world is fake, in a sense. So it's natural for stuff to seem off.
[1:27:23] <+silvery_cricket> I wonder if the field will blow out the camera walking into the zone
[1:27:23] <%solracc25> Now to kill Katherine
[1:27:25] <%NitronStreams> I forgot how long it was before you meet best boy GW

[1:28:52] <BerryliciousDefinition> RULES OF NATURE
[1:28:53] <%ssjklyco> They should release "Fucked up PS3 " DLC
[1:28:53] <thelonechris> As you slaughter sheep
[1:28:53] <majindusto> I CAN SEE

[1:28:59] <%TimetodiveLTX> its bluuuud
[1:29:00] <Ipsenscastle> I've been getting irrationally annoyed at all the reviews from people who played Automata first complaining that it's both too similar and not similar enough to Automata
[1:29:01] <Blackarrow1212> any weapon you're aimiing to use?
[1:29:02] <rekinom> -kicks a sheep- SO PEACEFUL
[1:29:04] <%athuramn> those blood graphics tho

[1:31:07] <%BoxNavy> he did :)
[1:31:07] <+glgzephyr> yo, for real, people who were ragging on the changes that they made to this game's soundtrack have AWFUL taste
[1:31:08] <%miguelrod777> sprinkle some crack on them
[1:31:09] <Broken_Sonex> @pixelkenj Let them stress over it
[1:31:09] <%depotagents> i dunno about that goof pat whoooof

[1:31:14] <InkyDraconian> is it still abortion if it's a whole however many millennia latr
[1:31:15] <%Nuclearcherries> The cop arc begins
[1:31:15] <%13ry4n93> don't do this
[1:31:15] <+silvery_cricket> "They were the wrong SHADE" - Pat Boivin
[1:31:17] <%za7az> "Damn shades, coming here and taking our jobs"
[1:31:19] <%czeekytv> If you're interested in this stream and know nothing about NieR, well, you had time to catch up lol
[1:31:20] <SomeAsianDood> Fascism go up
[1:31:21] <theOG_RB> jeez pat way to be a cop
[1:31:22] <Zeif00> not profiling ghosts
[1:31:23] <%ringabal> "Didn't like its darkness."
[1:31:23] <%rcand9> oh noo
[1:31:23] <Alfred_Waaghur> A black shade...
[1:31:23] <Parapattern> I confused my sword with my taser
[1:31:25] <Vertigheist> Pat the cop
[1:31:26] <Byorski> Now I'll go check on my sheep in the field OH GOD NO!!
[1:31:33] <%AzureGale> The healing herbs!
[1:31:33] <DSD24> So why is R capitalized in NieR? does the title do that?
[1:31:34] <%NitronStreams> I wish I could wipe my memory and experience this all for the first time again
[1:31:35] <%valriot> Pat been watchin too mant cop dramas LUL
[1:31:35] <EynosStyles> @za7az sometimes people don't need second chance lol
[1:31:38] <NekoUrabe> Beastbaaaain
[1:31:40] <%barkon345> I don't know the songs in this version just don't seem to hit as hard. I wonder if its the mix
[1:31:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> I like that there was not combat music there, for the sheep of the shades
[1:31:43] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Everytime Mutton is mentioned I think of Seinfeld
[1:31:43] <rekinom> Can't wait for the mod that replaces kid nier with Daddy nier
[1:31:43] <%JoshManVGH> One was clearly smoking, and that's deadly.
[1:31:43] <brachydios777> So in the Gestalt timeline, did the brother existed and he died and the Dad lived and vice versa in Replicant?
[1:31:54] <%TimetodiveLTX> that shade was reaching towards their pockets too fast
[1:31:57] <%Vextalyst> DON'T STAB that shade isn't black
[1:32:04] <%pilgrimsayswhat> pat i blame you for my inability to say the word wepawn normally anymore
[1:32:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wait, should I even buy new weapon? I was waiting until I had more money
[1:32:05] <%athuramn> whoa, spoilers
[1:32:06] <cardamomo88> not only replicant is cannon
[1:32:07] <pokefan9956> where's 2B :^)
[1:32:08] <%Aeogard> @barkon345 youre genuinely not the only one, but most people seem to like it. idk. i feel like they're all not as good so far
[1:32:14] <+megaman_sentinel> was that papa nier
[1:32:16] <yourliteraldog> @DSD24 It's a hard r
[1:32:17] <MonoReaper> @brachydios777 Father & Brother NieR exist in different timelines
[1:32:18] <LorcaNomad> @PatStaresAt do you think the phoenix spear is going to be nearly as powerful in this version?
[1:32:19] <%Valdorick> But Papa Nier will still be Brother Nier's voice.
[1:32:22] <josh813318> every time i here the music from this game, it's so great
[1:32:23] <+GigaSeifer> sleeping
[1:32:26] <josh813318> everytime
[1:32:26] <%ShinobiPhoenix> she take your herbs
[1:32:28] <sendart> the future past
[1:32:31] <DSD24> @yourliteraldog Damn that's true
[1:32:31] <+glgzephyr> @ShinobiPhoenix Beastbain is worth it early
[1:32:31] <Broken_Sonex> @rekinom But what about the voice?
[1:32:33] <+preppyposs> you know, I think it'd rule if the shadowlord in this remake was pap nier
[1:32:33] <+RyTYoung> wow for a change I'm further than pat in a game, by 5 mjnutest LUL
[1:32:33] <%KineticZen> @barkon345 I agree, the field music was missing some of the grace notes from the original, and there are too many layers
[1:32:33] <%depotagents> 2B is ore in the ground right now
[1:32:33] <%thedankestmeeme> you mean 2BOOTY
[1:32:33] <%ringabal> The Future's Future
[1:32:36] <%BoxNavy> 2b's NOT from this game? D:
[1:32:36] <%czeekytv> I kinda wish the flashback had Papa NieR and you played as young NieR, or vice-versa. Just to mess with people more
[1:32:39] <Byorski> 2B is not to be.  HA!
[1:32:39] <Tonicky > 2B is at the zoo
[1:32:40] <%JoshManVGH> When Dwarves!?
[1:32:40] <brachydios777> @monoreaper Got it
[1:32:40] <pixelkenj> She told me to go to the northern plains for herbs and I laughed in her face
[1:32:42] <%valriot> Shes in Ocarina of Time, or at least her ass is
[1:32:42] <xxshadowxx416> where robots
[1:32:42] <Alfred_Waaghur> 8000 years in the future
[1:32:42] <%radda343> she's gonna show up and murder the final boss for you
[1:32:42] <%Garthunox> @PatStaresAt you can turn on enemy health in the options
[1:32:43] <JeysJumbleJams> the before afterwards
[1:32:43] <penitentpendant> @pokefan9956 Making a surprise appearance
[1:32:44] <%linSP> 2b is sleeping
[1:32:45] <stukamod> In Blender
[1:32:45] <Qsmash_> man, I've only finished one run of Automata
[1:32:45] <+JJsAdventure> lol
[1:32:45] <%athuramn> ,pan the camera from below, you might find 2b
[1:32:48] <DenTimes> Aparrently they changed Nier's birthday
[1:32:50] <Flame_Water> are you an android or human?
[1:32:50] <+RyTYoung> minutes* thanks auto correct for the help NotLikeThis
[1:32:52] <Vertigheist> More like 2B continued
[1:32:57] <%Valdorick> 2B is on the Moon, clearly Kappa
[1:32:59] <%ringabal> You couldn't?
[1:32:59] <AllenDeadman> oh

[1:33:08] <brachydios777> Automata is waaay in the future
[1:33:13] <Visorak6> DO you wish it had a press button to continue thing?
[1:33:15] <AllenDeadman> that's problematic
[1:33:16] <%Arweynn> The real questions are where are Accord and Anemony, since they should both be around at this point, probably
[1:33:16] <NekoUrabe> It will repeat
[1:33:16] <jcflyguy> Meanwhile my load times are like 60+ seconds on PS4
[1:33:18] <Srthunda> loading times are getting two fast, time to nerf them
[1:33:18] <Manwad> do you think there's gonna be a fucked up journal entry for one of them
[1:33:18] <%walternatorz> 4?
[1:33:19] <Unnoble> man papa nier really smol
[1:33:20] <%Nuclearcherries> The PS5 is a blessing and a curse
[1:33:23] <%Tearonex> Tearonex subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! Happy belated Bday Pat! And welcome back to Nier where you're totally playing as the good guys the entire game!
[1:33:23] <majindusto> Shouldn't  have looked
[1:33:24] <mr_saturday93> yes the ps3 fast load timds
[1:33:25] <%ringabal> @PatStaresAt Popola and Devola sang a song for Yonah
[1:33:25] <MonoReaper> Yorha Androids at this point dont even exist
[1:33:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> fucking ssd, stealing my lore
[1:33:26] <Broken_Sonex> 2B does take place in the future so no ass yet
[1:33:30] <+vascillia> Just joined - how is pat liking brother nier so far?
[1:33:30] <+TheKeysmash> @DenTimes brother nier's bday was always june 6th
[1:33:34] <peyodogo> i hate what they did to the popola version of this song
[1:33:34] <+ShotgunJesus> jump off the 2nd story
[1:33:36] <pixelkenj> 3 mutton solves a food shortage
[1:33:37] <+silvery_cricket> I like that the map on the wall is faded to being nothing
[1:33:39] <%za7az> @EynosStyles Particularly when that second chance leads to more deaths. There's a reason the average age of mortality went up when the world transitioned to the modern age.
[1:33:40] <brunoberserk> the true question is : were's 2B's BOOTY
[1:33:41] <karovus> fast load times are unfortunate for those loading screens
[1:33:41] <%pilgrimsayswhat> "Press X to Proceed" easy as that
[1:33:41] <%ElkRiverDog> I got as gas as “Devola and Popala”
[1:33:42] <inutaihanyou123> this is played on ps5 pat?
[1:33:45] <%Arweynn> LUL
[1:33:46] <+ShotgunJesus> double jump. aww
[1:33:47] <%ChestMimik> Twinkopalypse
[1:33:50] <olm46> Only medium asses thus far
[1:33:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> speaking of missing another chance to also get my Xbox
[1:33:52] <+Javaa01> Big Asses are forbidden technology in this time
[1:33:53] <Broken_Sonex> IT WAS A LOT OF RECARCH
[1:33:53] <%13ry4n93> I don't know what about devola?
[1:33:53] <TheBasicEvil> DN is still stuck on short skirts
[1:33:54] <%athuramn> hence, kaine
[1:33:54] <%linSP> this is B.A. before asses
[1:33:55] <%shurtal> Steiner has to show up
[1:33:57] <FoxInABeret> Proto-Ass is here, though.
[1:33:57] <%13ry4n93> what's her ass like
[1:33:59] <devanmuse> ten thousand years of R&D to perfect FAT ASSES
[1:33:59] <TheBasicEvil> RND
[1:33:59] <ahmz1404> that white loading screen is a big turn off
[1:34:00] <Ipsenscastle> big asses are way at the end of the tech tree
[1:34:01] <SomeAsianDood> Literal millenia of reseearch to perfect dat ass
[1:34:01] <%Monkeyweed21> Devola has a big dumper
[1:34:01] <%Valdorick> Remember when Loading Screens had minigames and lore because of long load times?... Maybe... if you remaster your stuff... you should have an option to turn loadscreens into prompts?
[1:34:03] <Tonuha> This library gives me feels
[1:34:04] <%walternatorz> muttons can only produce asses so large. and don't get started on robot asses
[1:34:04] <+silvery_cricket> 50,000 polygons in that ass show some respect
[1:34:04] <%Ranryu692> Professor Mix-A-Lot is hard at work, though
[1:34:04] <%thedankestmeeme> wait the othe girl got a lil booty
[1:34:07] <+glgzephyr> Kaine's ass is still pretty good tho.
[1:34:11] <Mr_JustinJones> No one asks hows 2B's Butt :(
[1:34:13] <%czeekytv> GOOD
[1:34:14] <yourliteraldog> Big Asses require Black Box technology
[1:34:14] <2DSuperiority> give the shota androids small shorts yessss
[1:34:19] <%valriot> 2Bs Zelda file ass, so like her butthole gotta be Castle Town
[1:34:20] <EynosStyles> @za7az agreed
[1:34:26] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @Valdorick remember when those got copyrighted somewhere
[1:34:27] <+Pengers> Only twinks in this age
[1:34:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[1:34:29] <$Mudze7> you didn't even play it that long ago
[1:34:31] <%hamborgini> ew stinky
[1:34:32] <cardamomo88> true
[1:34:33] <Ipsenscastle> No NieR looked like dogshit for real
[1:34:34] <LorcaNomad> it totally does
[1:34:36] <%Agami23> that means the remake is doing its job
[1:34:40] <%radda343> it'd have that 360 goo smeared all over it
[1:34:40] <+cafefunk> how are you doing today Pat?
[1:34:40] <%AzureGale> p much
[1:34:40] <%czeekytv> That's a good way of putting it. This feels very close to what I remember
[1:34:41] <DenTimes> @TheKeysmash oh, i didn't know that thank you
[1:34:42] <rekinom> StockRoosterNoiseDotWav
[1:34:43] <%depotagents> the old nier looks very... oily. this looks a lot better
[1:34:43] <%Garthunox> Boy! That library sure looks familiar!
[1:34:44] <Murphio_GS> Pat would turn into Friday Night Funkin'
[1:34:45] <majindusto> It's  so Bad lol
[1:34:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I like that mailboxes heal you, but the game never tells you that
[1:34:46] <%13ry4n93> it's kinda of like the remaster of shadow of the colossus

[1:35:31] <%ringabal> NIER NO, WHAT IS YOU DOING
[1:35:32] <+DrGlendale> wups
[1:35:33] <mass1997> no
[1:35:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> did it?
[1:35:35] <%JoshManVGH> Before the game maybe
[1:35:35] <%ssjklyco> No
[1:35:36] <%czeekytv> @kingdinkyI it's rough lol. I love the new looks
[1:35:37] <%Agami23> she did
[1:35:37] <rekinom> is that specific to kid nier?
[1:35:38] <NekoUrabe> Nier told her
[1:35:38] <pixelkenj> nah
[1:35:41] <cardamomo88> AH NO
[1:35:41] <%JoshManVGH> No
[1:35:42] <%TimetodiveLTX> maybe
[1:35:44] <Ipsenscastle> NieR looked like it was random assets barely glued together. It looked like fucking Omikron
[1:35:44] <%TimetodiveLTX> i don't know
[1:35:45] <+silvery_cricket> Lunar Tiers were a thing yes
[1:35:46] <%MisterRockett> Yeah this totally happened originally.
[1:35:49] <pixelkenj> its just a story he knew beforehand
[1:35:50] <Tonicky > nope
[1:35:51] <xinexes> i didnt hear it
[1:35:51] <%FallenAngelSC2> This is what makes her go to the shrine
[1:35:52] <%linSP> i also have adhd
[1:35:52] <+glgzephyr> not that we've seen, but NieR has known Popola for some time, so it's quite plausible that she told him at some other point. She hasn't mentioned it in front of you
[1:35:52] <TioXyco> papa nier talks about the lunar tear too
[1:35:53] <OneThousandTomatoes> no popola didnt just tell you
[1:35:56] <+TheKeysmash> @DenTimes he shares yoko taros birthday originally as a placeholder but it just stuck
[1:35:56] <%JoshManVGH> She didn't probably days befoe the story started.
[1:35:58] <JeysJumbleJams> i think this was an offscreen thing
[1:36:00] <%TimetodiveLTX> could you repeat the question
[1:36:00] <%barkon345> ok ive been comparing the different versions of the music and you guys saying this version has the better music are crazy
[1:36:01] <%czeekytv> Yohna knowing about the lunar tear is kind of important at the start of the game @PatStaresAt
[1:36:01] <%patriotrenegade> no she told you in the past
[1:36:03] <yourliteraldog> He seems to making up a story
[1:36:05] <majindusto> Pat not paying  attention enigmaKEK
[1:36:05] <%ringabal> Nope
[1:36:06] <%Tearonex> Lunar tears were ALWAYS a thing
[1:36:08] <+Javaa01> The dementia ain't that bad quite yet
[1:36:09] <Kenyuki4> Lunar Tears was always in
[1:36:10] <peyodogo> i think i remember this but idk if it was phrased this way or if it happened this early
[1:36:10] <pixelkenj> it did not just happen
[1:36:11] <+ShotgunJesus> seeing random ones in Automata was weird
[1:36:12] <EynosStyles> Wait! How did these people advance far enough to invent spaceships and android.
[1:36:12] <+chocoborb> whoa new dialogue? didnt he state in the original game to make her better not make them rich???
[1:36:13] <%OdeToKale> not onscreen no.
[1:36:15] <+RyTYoung> no she never mentioned it
[1:36:16] <%czeekytv> Yonah* wow
[1:36:17] <Agami23> pats going senial again
[1:36:18] <inutaihanyou123> they changed script t9 make more sense. since he just randomly brings up a wish in og
[1:36:18] <%JoshManVGH> Nope.
[1:36:19] <+JJsAdventure> think pala mentioned it granted wishes
[1:36:21] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> no he either makes it up or hears about it before the game starts
[1:36:21] <Sapphire_Breeze> we don't
[1:36:21] <kapitankolin> this is the first mention of lunar tears in the script
[1:36:21] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[1:36:22] <+preppyposs> @PatStaresAt oh you know why brother neir makes some more sense than papa nier? In gestalt a 30 something looking for a magic to cure his daughter is kind of silly

[1:39:57] <%Monkeyweed21> they attacked someone
[1:39:57] <+preppyposs> much like a chile
[1:39:57] <%MisterRockett> It's... REALLY weird.
[1:39:57] <cardamomo88> they kinda bad in their job
[1:39:58] <Byorski> but SO MUCH BLOOD
[1:39:58] <Ipsenscastle> you shouldn't have candles that close to the ceiling
[1:39:58] <%weissguard> I mean, as it stands, they're still dangerous.
[1:40:00] <%ChestMimik> I KILLED EM ALL POPOLA
[1:40:00] <+silvery_cricket> Nier they didn't fight back
[1:40:01] <+preppyposs> child

[1:40:04] <%SilvaChariot0133> Easy as snuffing younglings Kappa
[1:40:04] <%JoshManVGH> Wouls the weather cycles still happen in a tidaly locked planet?
[1:40:06] <olaksi> A lot about the plot makes much more sense with Papa Nier tbh
[1:40:07] <%Rumbutt> They were so weak, as weak as babies...
[1:40:10] <%solracc25> Must defeat the Heartless
[1:40:13] <PartyFavors> Disconcerting!
[1:40:13] <FoxInABeret> "They didn't even fight back! It was super easy!"
[1:40:13] <bahamut1010> Kill them all

[1:40:15] <josh813318> i think if they have become shades they've already lost their sanity
[1:40:17] <%Deft_Thought> 🤔
[1:40:17] <%hamborgini> genoshade
[1:40:24] <%ChestMimik> "I killed them while screaming HARD slurs"

[1:40:26] <+silvery_cricket> Calm down Wakka
[1:40:27] <inutaihanyou123> is popola in the village to monitor the replicants
[1:40:27] <OneThousandTomatoes> sometimes twitch is stupid and music gets warbley
[1:40:27] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Maybe they've just given up and are trying to run damage control?
[1:40:28] <Tonuha> Maybe she wants him to get merc'd?
[1:40:28] <%Vextalyst> they're even worse than those dirty albhed
[1:40:28] <+megaman_sentinel> Pat noooooo

[1:40:33] <brunoberserk> '' i just sayin BRUDDAH ''
[1:40:36] <yourliteraldog> They want to miscegenate with our women

[1:40:39] <cardamomo88> murder
[1:40:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt she needs to him to take care of the ones that are attacking people

[1:40:46] <Vertigheist> Those darn dirty dark shades
[1:40:47] <%Kurokoi64> The women and children too
[1:40:47] <%JoshManVGH> Popola sending a child off to die
[1:40:52] <%Aeogard> @PatStaresAt Don't forget that rolling around is still faster :)
[1:40:54] <2DSuperiority> when do you fight the 50 Shades of Grey?
[1:40:55] <+ShotgunJesus> that's the one you missed
[1:40:57] <+silvery_cricket> SO HIS NAME IS NIER
[1:40:58] <%Kurokoi64> the darkness of their bodies scared me into a murderous rage
[1:41:00] <Kenyuki4> Popola I strangled those Shades so GOOD!!!!
[1:41:00] <Laecerelius> Brother NieR LOVES the Punisher
[1:41:03] <+pupil31> SourPls
[1:41:03] <kingdinkyI> The ones that attack people are lost causes I believe
[1:41:05] <%solracc25> tiffosCrow
[1:41:06] <%barkon345> @olaksi eh ther are things that make more sense with him as a father and things that make more sense with him as her brother
[1:41:07] <+glgzephyr> I find it funny that Zach Aguilar, cast as young NieR, also voices Deku, Tanjiro, and Keitaro Miura, all of whom are obsessively protective of their little sisters LUL
[1:41:07] <majindusto> NieR?
[1:41:10] <%hoodedlefty> my guess is that she wants the relapsed shades killed
[1:41:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> Boy, NieR wants to wiener popola , huh
[1:41:13] <bahamut1010> catJAM catJAM catJAM
[1:41:14] <+pupil31> D:
[1:41:14] <%linSP> die beast!
[1:41:19] <FirewallStorm> if I can't see the game what's the point
[1:41:19] <OneThousandTomatoes> @silvery_cricket because pat named him that
[1:41:19] <yourliteraldog> Have you heard of Human replacement theory- NieR probably
[1:41:20] <42nfl19> @PatStaresAt What if....they actually added a day/night in this remaster? How horrible...
[1:41:29] <+silvery_cricket> Young Nier just ripping that sheep apart with his bare hands
[1:41:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> this world being at night would totally be Doomed. actually come to think of it, Automata does have a night
[1:41:31] <+cafefunk> hey chat if you had the opportunity to be immortal would you take it?
[1:41:34] <%Ranryu692> his name is Nier in the script, so that's pretty definitively canon now
[1:41:35] <gslayer14> boar drifting imminent?
[1:41:42] <%SilvaChariot0133> Hell no
[1:41:43] <%BoxNavy> die

[1:41:49] <blackbaron98> Doesn't this game take place like 3 years later?
[1:41:54] <cardamomo88> ha
[1:41:59] <vapidq> @barkon345 oh yeah, i hear the difference now, not sure which one I prefer tho
[1:41:59] <%hamborgini> how did he learn those moves without a dvd player to watch the anime?
[1:42:00] <Agrathane> @hamborgini either that or a mass-shade-cre
[1:42:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> get wrecked
[1:42:02] <tattleworm> they gave the mc a canon name in nier reincarnation but it's a bit of a spoiler
[1:42:02] <%solracc25> psaCrazyhead tiffosBangBang

[1:42:09] <+silvery_cricket> Pat swung first we all saw it
[1:42:13] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @blackbaron98 later than?
[1:42:15] <%weissguard> Just a little Kappa
[1:42:17] <@Pandora_Prime> THAT is a dark souls roll

[1:42:39] <blackbaron98> @pilgrimsayswhat the prologue
[1:42:39] <+JJsAdventure> does this look like 3 years later
[1:42:40] <brachydios777> Woah
[1:42:40] <OneThousandTomatoes> the music transitions are so smooth
[1:42:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's very easy to outdo the tutorial if you play Character action games
[1:42:42] <%AyotoCorp> I was 4 hours into the game when I got the tutorial on how to charge up spells
[1:42:46] <teefpal> Oof I can't wait for the second part of the game
[1:42:48] <SomeAsianDood> how wide is the parry window?
[1:42:48] <+cafefunk> I think immortality sounds like torture but I'd like to live to 200
[1:42:49] <%AyotoCorp> I have no idea what the game is doing
[1:42:51] <%ringabal> "The shades struck first! I had to do sick combos on them!"
[1:42:55] <%bread_assassin> There's probably a good amount of people coming to this having only played Automata, and they are gonna get spoiled immediately when they see Popula and Devola.
[1:42:56] <+ShotgunJesus> is the boar around?
[1:42:57] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @blackbaron98 1,412 years later

[1:47:29] <%livlinn> Sadly not that simple
[1:47:29] <AllenDeadman> IS THAT THE TAKE AWAY?

[1:47:30] <Broken_Sonex> BAN IT ALL
[1:47:32] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> It is not manly to read

[1:47:33] <TheRealNumberJ42> @teefpal you're lucky
[1:47:33] <+robosqueeb> thats definitely a take
[1:47:33] <TioXyco> why BAN the books if you can BURN them?!
[1:47:34] <CatRidder> ban comics
[1:47:35] <NaderShahDidNothingWrong> Literacy is necessary for the function of a modern society
[1:47:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @vidulasaix *cough* let's just say I did a few Re-loads

[1:47:45] <OneThousandTomatoes> wasnt the dad a scientist though? i think reading is nessesary and he would teach his kids
[1:47:46] <SomeAsianDood> We got a Ray Bradbury situation up in here
[1:47:46] <crajoro2> @hephep_311 thanks!
[1:47:46] <yourliteraldog> Pat is actually correct that's reason it was Illegal to teach slaves to read in the american south
[1:47:47] <StarlitStunner> Destroy the means of literature
[1:47:47] <+DrGlendale> MMMNNNN SCARY BIT

[1:47:52] <pixelkenj> weird how he doesnt even TRY to shout her name
[1:47:53] <%NitronStreams> Exchanging ideas was a mistake
[1:47:56] <pi_in_the_sci> you need a certain amount of reading for society to function, the world requires accountants
[1:47:56] <%Kurokoi64> If Fareignhight 451 has taught me anything its that banning books leads to Blade Wolf
[1:47:57] <+ringabal> YMIR, STOP USING PATHS TO READ DOUJINS
[1:47:57] <Vertigheist> So going back to the Middle Ages gotcha
[1:47:57] <Broken_Sonex> @PatStaresAt Why not just burn them?

[1:48:26] <%valriot> Book burning isnt a thing i thought id hear as a suggestion
[1:48:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh no, smoke
[1:48:31] <%Monkeyweed21> burn the children
[1:48:31] <TioXyco> burning the books is safer than banning them
[1:48:33] <NekoUrabe> Papa Pat

[1:48:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Yona doko?
[1:48:46] <cardamomo88> she is a speed demon
[1:48:51] <iamtheTwitchghost> oh no
[1:48:53] <pixelkenj> we were JUST here
[1:48:55] <Man_in_the_Red> @teefpal not as bad, people are just pissed their wish fufillment mecha anime became a war drama
[1:48:56] <%Piemen99> FUCK
[1:48:56] <+warlockwithapixie> WHY
[1:48:58] <Tonuha> Want Popola to go "Oh fuck"
[1:48:58] <%linSP> poopoola you dinkass
[1:48:59] <yourliteraldog> If they couldn't read and banned book is meaningless.
[1:49:00] <Vertigheist> Let’s burn the people who can read while we’re at it
[1:49:02] <%EynosStyles> damn it. popola
[1:49:02] <%ringabal> POPOLAAAAA
[1:49:04] <Profmcstevie> YOU FUCKING

[1:49:10] <Zourath> Burn a book, stay warm for a day. Teach the kids to eat books... I think this metaphor is falling apart.
[1:49:14] <+TheotherKristian> You gave her knowledge!?!!?
[1:49:14] <%Valdorick> Why are you sending Yona to fucking LOST SHRINES!?
[1:49:16] <+DrGlendale> lol, just found the Matt Mercy NPC in my game
[1:49:17] <pixelkenj> instead of..... just wishing her to get better
[1:49:20] <vapidq> doesn't the game design seem mmo-ish? fetch quests and going to the same place over and over
[1:49:21] <+glgzephyr> oh no I'm a moron and so is my sister
[1:49:22] <%walternatorz> that dumb bitch
[1:49:27] <Tonicky > I miss Papa Nier but like a lot of the dialogue makes more sense coming from a teen than a grown man lol
[1:49:28] <%Kurokoi64> Yona dumb as hell
[1:49:32] <ARDM112> Who the hell would even let Yonah out of the village?
[1:49:33] <Jontman42> idiot child
[1:49:34] <mrapplebucks> you fucked up
[1:49:34] <%JoshManVGH> Didn't Papa Nier tell her they were magic?

[1:49:39] <laserbeaming> Nierboy has really low Mental Stats
[1:49:39] <%BoxNavy> looks like a lily
[1:49:39] <%Agami23> probably a lily
[1:49:40] <teefpal> OH WOMEN LOVE BEING SLAVES
[1:49:40] <$Mudze7> looks like a lily?
[1:49:41] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Sounds like a lily of some kind?
[1:49:41] <%EynosStyles> I think
[1:49:43] <MonoReaper> Its one of the evil plants int he universe
[1:49:43] <FoxInABeret> Isn't it a lily?
[1:49:43] <%Ranryu692> looks like a lily
[1:49:43] <%patriotrenegade> But she isnt allowed out of the gates
[1:49:44] <%Deft_Thought> I think its a Lily
[1:49:44] <+Catpurnicus> its basically an anime orchid
[1:49:44] <UTaken34> Wasn't the story how it coudl just grant you any wish in the original?
[1:49:45] <SomeAsianDood> Lily
[1:49:46] <ARDM112> Like I'm sure Yonah is pretty famous and one of the adults would stop her
[1:49:47] <%patriotrenegade> lily
[1:49:47] <cardamomo88> lily
[1:49:49] <%superc37> its just a flower
[1:49:49] <%thelaxinator> looks kinda like the MGS3 flower
[1:49:49] <s1rcuit> so is NieR Replicant a remake of a previous Nier game?
[1:49:55] <%TimetodiveLTX> F
[1:49:56] <+DrGlendale> the lesbian flower
[1:49:57] <%Kurokoi64> Oh boy slaves
[1:50:00] <pixelkenj> how about some floral perfume :)
[1:50:00] <xinexes> its a flower FLOWER
[1:50:01] <%Aeogard> lunar tear is the drakengard flower with a slightly different color :) :)
[1:50:01] <Man_in_the_Red> @tonicky oh yeah they recycled fuckin everything for Papa Nier LUL
[1:50:01] <%garbageheaphound> when does NeiR get pants that dont suck?
[1:50:02] <teefpal> Its a revision
[1:50:02] <%Kurokoi64> that never goes wrong
[1:50:06] <Daniel_Is_I> Can't smell them? Can't learn about them.
[1:50:08] <AllenDeadman> it's a fantasy lily
[1:50:10] <PartyFavors> @s1rcuit yeah, of the original NieR
[1:50:12] <%Valdorick> Things so dire, Devola stopped the town music.
[1:50:14] <MonoReaper> @ARDM112 They told her on purpose so she would go to the castle
[1:50:16] <SomeAsianDood> Nier replicant is the previous nier game @s1rcuit
[1:50:18] <+Catpurnicus> ask the cosplayer that had Yoko Taro sign her thigh I guess
[1:50:20] <%EynosStyles> @patstaresat they are his natural enemy,  cause you know allergies
[1:50:24] <%depotagents> Is there a connection between lunar tears and The Flower or..?
[1:50:24] <%Piemen99> oh ye pat's nose is so fucked he'll die if he smells anything good
[1:50:28] <MKII> "I know you care about yonah, but dont care too much okay"
[1:50:28] <FirewallStorm> I hope the next Yoko Taro game goes back to the dimensional horror thing
[1:50:28] <%The_Gaming_Karp> So many remakes, and yet it will never be Morrowind.
[1:50:29] <%Kurokoi64> I bet Kaine's dick cheese smells like lilies
[1:50:29] <Kenyuki4> Can anyone actually smell flowers?
[1:50:30] <s1rcuit> cool, thanks guys
[1:50:32] <teefpal> I should probably beat Nier Automata before watching this
[1:50:33] <%shootbang_exe> is he playing this on pc or ps5?
[1:50:40] <NekoUrabe> @DrGlendale I understood that reference
[1:50:41] <%Monkeyweed21> @depotagents its unclear
[1:50:43] <+glgzephyr> @depotagents only if you want there to be
[1:50:44] <Blackarrow1212> LUL
[1:50:46] <Man_in_the_Red> ooh shiny
[1:50:47] <%SilvaChariot0133> Ps5
[1:50:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @s1rcuit Yes. it's a remake of the game NieR Replicant. no, that's not a joke
[1:50:49] <%Ranryu692> ps5
[1:50:50] <%TimetodiveLTX> lol
[1:50:51] <teefpal> ?
[1:50:54] <AllenDeadman> asdadad
[1:50:55] <UTaken34> @teefpal it's before automata so you're good
[1:50:55] <+TheMilkiestShake> @teefpal It's a prequel
[1:50:58] <%The_Gaming_Karp> That fool!
[1:50:58] <pixelkenj> the guards just let her pass?
[1:51:00] <%patriotrenegade> These gate guards are fucking garbage, shit, they had one job
[1:51:05] <%Valdorick> Reminder - THE GUARDS THERE LET HER OUT
[1:51:06] <%Kurokoi64> "That dumb whore!"
[1:51:08] <+JJsAdventure> @shootbang_exe The gamecast
[1:51:09] <Man_in_the_Red> @themilkiestshake
[1:51:13] <%Piemen99> The guards just let her past?
[1:51:14] <%caramelatte1> Need to break her legs next.
[1:51:14] <%EynosStyles> @teefpal no needed they aren't related
[1:51:14] <%czeekytv> peepee
[1:51:15] <OneThousandTomatoes> just as a warning theres gonna be a lot of spoiling in chat, because pat played the original
[1:51:16] <Man_in_the_Red> just... no
[1:51:16] <Blackarrow1212> what are the guards doing
[1:51:17] <%patriotrenegade> LITERALLY ONE JOB
[1:51:19] <PartyFavors> Blame the guards
[1:51:20] <s1rcuit> @ShinobiPhoenix you're good, I believe you, I just don't know much about the Nier franchise
[1:51:21] <%Piemen99> What fucking idiots
[1:51:24] <%walternatorz> the guards were making out too much to take notice of a small, sickly child
[1:51:25] <RWLJr98> First she does this, then she drops the cookie? WHATS NEXT?!
[1:51:30] <%Kurokoi64> literally a single job
[1:51:31] <PartyFavors> Elmo went to the lost shrine???
[1:51:32] <$Mudze7> the guards saw an opportunity to get the villagers to shut up about how well behaved she is for five seconds
[1:51:37] <%czeekytv> @patriotrenegade Yeah they don't even mention "hey yeah I saw that sick sister of yours run off to a dangerous place". Useless
[1:51:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I said the same thing, why would the guards let her out. did she use Cute-No Jitsu
[1:51:45] <%The_Gaming_Karp> It helps that I barely remember the plot from the original LP
[1:52:00] <Profmcstevie> She coughs like once every 5 seconds, how does she sneak out ANYWHERE
[1:52:01] <%ringabal> Clearly Yonah read a Metal Gear novel, to help her sneaking skills
[1:52:02] <%carnelg> doodThirst doodDead doodThirst doodSwear jennsLurk
[1:52:08] <%EynosStyles> @onethousandtomatoes the fact there are people from that far back speaks to the quality of the content
[1:52:39] <kingdinkyI> @s1rcuit I recommend Clemp’s Videos than they helped me with Drakkengard
[1:52:39] <%EynosStyles> @profmcstevie yonah is a fake bitch that's why
[1:52:40] <SomeAsianDood> BTW chat, is Pat on track to meet THAT THING in disco elysium?
[1:52:44] <%czeekytv> Yo everyone, Pyre (from SuperGiant games aka Hades) is on sale for -70% off on Steam
[1:52:46] <+qanonisadeathcult> best brb on the internet
[1:52:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> i guess so, I haven't been around here that long myself
[1:52:57] <+pupil31> SourPls
[1:53:09] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:53:13] <s1rcuit> @kingdinkyI I'll check that out, thanks
[1:53:14] <+EySoyCoco> is really the framerate bugged on pc so fucks up the animations?
[1:53:15] <$Mudze7> i've been stuck in this pit for teeeen yeaaaaars
[1:53:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> now that this game is out and I don't remember much of the OG LP, I can't watch Clemps' videos now either
[1:53:27] <lemon_lover28> both have the name Nier in them?
[1:53:32] <%EynosStyles> @onethousandtomatoes seen them sense machiama days
[1:53:33] <%OdeToKale> looks clean
[1:53:34] <pixelkenj> just like Taro's soul
[1:53:35] <$Mudze7> @PatStaresAt looked it up, it's close to a white balloon flower if you want to see one irl
[1:53:36] <%caramelatte1> Well same world isnt it right?
[1:53:37] <laserbeaming> gotta stay consistent
[1:53:37] <%ssjklyco> Books and old PC screens
[1:53:39] <%walternatorz> yoko is colorblind?
[1:53:39] <+pupil31> It's that PS3 era palette
[1:53:40] <%BoxNavy> i like it alot
[1:53:40] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Better than the Gritty Grey (tm) most games use nowadays.
[1:53:40] <yourliteraldog> But it looks good tho
[1:53:43] <%Agami23> well with nier, it was the style of the time to be brown
[1:53:45] <AllenDeadman> it's definetly a choice
[1:53:45] <Qsmash_> early 2010s color palette
[1:53:47] <%TimetodiveLTX> @EySoyCoco if the game runs above 60fps it makes the animations too fast
[1:53:48] <%JoshManVGH> @patstaresat it looks like Lunar Tears are based on a real flower called Moonflowers or "Tropical White Morning Glory"
[1:53:51] <UTaken34> BRANCH D THE FINAL SONG
[1:53:55] <+DrGlendale> isn't it that way in the drakengard games too?
[1:53:58] <$Mudze7> why's it called mutton pat
[1:54:02] <+SilverDevilfish> Goat in
[1:54:03] <%Aeogard> replicant looks better with lower brightness/gamma tho too
[1:54:05] <%linSP> gone?
[1:54:05] <pixelkenj> only 10 herbs
[1:54:06] <+salemthesalami> im late wtf is going on
[1:54:12] <penitentpendant> Inventory limit, oh no
[1:54:14] <+megaman_sentinel> 9
[1:54:15] <Profmcstevie> full stack of da erb
[1:54:17] <Blackarrow1212> its gone now?
[1:54:25] <%EynosStyles> Japanese love flower symbolism
[1:54:26] <+cafefunk> so is there a version of Gestalt being planned as well
[1:54:27] <2DSuperiority> Lil boy shorts can only hold so much
[1:54:34] <%The_Gaming_Karp> IIRC this is the game where weapons themselves have storylines, yes?
[1:54:37] <SulfurousAcid> there was an herb here, it's gone now
[1:54:37] <pixelkenj> Herbal Estus
[1:54:44] <TioXyco> @cafefunk as far as we know, nope.
[1:54:44] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I let these goats live until one kicked me
[1:54:45] <SomeAsianDood> doesnt look like it sadly @cafefunk
[1:54:48] <$Mudze7> @The_Gaming_Karp yep
[1:54:48] <+R0DA> @The_Gaming_Karp ye
[1:54:50] <%bootsjay> i remember enemies having health bars
[1:55:03] <NekoUrabe> Goat sounds dumb to say out loud
[1:55:06] <$Mudze7> have to turn it on
[1:55:09] <%Aeogard> @The_Gaming_Karp technically Gestalt/replicant didnt actually have them in the game itself, that was in outside materials and Drakengard 1-3
[1:55:10] <+cafefunk> how different are the two versions other than the age of the character
[1:55:12] <$Mudze7> health bars are off by default
[1:55:13] <+warlockwithapixie> 1 inch from his face
[1:55:13] <pixelkenj> yonah CAUSED it
[1:55:16] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @bootsjay You can turn that on in settings
[1:55:16] <s1rcuit> @kingdinkyI is there any video specifically I should watch?
[1:55:17] <%ringabal> Smushes face into boulder
[1:55:18] <yourliteraldog> WHERE THO
[1:55:23] <+qanonisadeathcult> @someasiandood what is the 'that one part'
[1:55:24] <tattleworm> original release of nier didn't have weapon stories, they were in the book, they put them in here though
[1:55:29] <%ringabal> HOW CAN THIS BE
[1:55:34] <pixelkenj> she summoned Nightmare to break down the wall
[1:55:37] <+megaman_sentinel> jump climb
[1:55:39] <radioamnesiac> are we playing on a playstation#?
[1:55:43] <softbirby> I hope this does well enough for them to release a pap nier version again
[1:55:48] <$Mudze7> @PatStaresAt you may want to chuck health bars on, I remember not having them bugging you
[1:55:48] <%BoxNavy> apartment buildings monkaS
[1:55:51] <radioamnesiac> i got the pc version and i'm Concerned
[1:55:56] <%EynosStyles> okay. how did she get that far. seriously
[1:55:57] <Tonuha> Oh I totally forgot about this fucking place
[1:55:58] <SomeAsianDood> @Arsimckhoi ?
[1:56:03] <%SilvaChariot0133> The shit around it is new
[1:56:07] <%Aeogard> THE SKYSCRAPERS???
[1:56:12] <%czeekytv> This looks so much like the city ruins from automata
[1:56:13] <TheRealNumberJ42> too much BLOOM
[1:56:23] <neidhardt0> Yea the bloom blocked it
[1:56:23] <+megaman_sentinel> it was there
[1:56:28] <2DSuperiority> @radioamnesiac cap fps at 60 in Nvidia control panel and it will run fine
[1:56:30] <%linSP> those are skyscrapers
[1:56:31] <pixelkenj> Wait till you see the shelves inside
[1:56:40] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I also do not recall the urban ruins until nearer the end.
[1:56:46] <%bootsjay> yeah i just thought it was some temple
[1:56:48] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> ADD MORE BLOOM
[1:56:48] <Tracazoid> I think you compared it to a car park in the original LP
[1:56:49] <$Ziegsy> wait till you see thr floor tiles inside
[1:56:51] <radioamnesiac> @2DSuperiority oh, sick, thank you
[1:56:55] <NekoUrabe> Music audio seems to sound warped Pat
[1:56:56] <%depotagents> how are the buildings in automata still recognizable but these are hard to make out?
[1:56:56] <@commanderclaw> Why did the 360 era love bloom so fucking much?
[1:57:00] <+ryujinran> original neir's lighting was blinding
[1:57:01] <%BoxNavy> yeah theres like cardboard boxes and metal shelves inside of the shrine. its weird.
[1:57:05] <%Valdorick> Magic bullshit, its fine.
[1:57:07] <%Aleate> Birds for scale
[1:57:09] <pixelkenj> how many floors are there?
[1:57:11] <%walternatorz> SAD TREE
[1:57:12] <FirewallStorm> need more BLOOM
[1:57:14] <laserbeaming> idk why, but watching you play this makes me wanna play Dragon's Dogma
[1:57:14] <mass1997> Its so good
[1:57:15] <EnnuiOnStream> Map of this area has a bridge leading out now
[1:57:16] <TheRealNumberJ42> it's magic we don't have to explain shit
[1:57:18] <yourliteraldog> Shut up its cool
[1:57:18] <%BoxNavy> pressure treated lumber too
[1:57:21] <%radda343> "There's nothingn worse than a sad tree"
[1:57:22] <%weissguard> But no, elevator! - Yoko Taro
[1:57:24] <%The_Gaming_Karp> The Deku Tree
[1:57:24] <%ssjklyco> It's the DS 2 Windmill
[1:57:24] <%czeekytv> @commanderclaw obscured things so you had to render less? otherwise idk
[1:57:25] <$Ziegsy> theres  a bathtub up there. why?
[1:57:29] <brachydios777> Is this the same engine as Automata?
[1:57:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> music good
[1:57:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so what was this building? it looks like offices and living space
[1:57:32] <NekoUrabe> The Incomplete Stone
[1:57:32] <%BigDumBeak> ah, like the volcano behind the poison windmin in DS2 I see
[1:57:34] <LorcaNomad> HYMNS ARE MY FAVORITE
[1:57:35] <SulfurousAcid> whens kaine's theme
[1:57:38] <nevan_44> SourPls
[1:57:39] <neidhardt0> yea the audio sounded a little weird for me
[1:57:40] <olm46> There's magical loops going on up there.
[1:57:41] <+Catpurnicus> its the jurassic park visitor's center
[1:57:44] <$Mudze7> some of the vocals don't hit as hard
[1:57:46] <%Maids4lyfe> The game looks like they somehow captured the nostalgia my brain had for the original version
[1:57:46] <%TimetodiveLTX> press circle to yonah
[1:57:46] <fimbulvetr27> I love this remix
[1:57:47] <%Mendin> ...is this The Pendants from The Crystarium???
[1:57:47] <softbirby> Man, I relaly miss papa nier
[1:57:47] <%patriotrenegade> Time fit BOX PUZZLES
[1:57:49] <$Ziegsy> told ya, floortiles
[1:57:51] <eristhanewood> People complaining about Keiichi Okabe? get em the fuck out of here
[1:57:51] <%KineticZen> This remix is fine because the men's choir was out of tune in the original
[1:57:53] <TheWorldRefusedToChange> WHO COMPLAINED??
[1:57:54] <%Aeogard> its good but it isn't the same :/
[1:57:54] <tattleworm> drifting sands is bad
[1:57:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I was singing along with this song the WHOLE TIME
[1:57:57] <neidhardt0> don't know if its gone now though. it sounded warped for a while
[1:58:00] <deviljhojho_> i think it was a couple of specific tracks but never looked to depe into it
[1:58:02] <%walternatorz> music is great, they just go ultra heavy between zones
[1:58:04] <+megaman_sentinel> dungeon 1 lol
[1:58:05] <%depotagents> @Mendin n, no lmao
[1:58:07] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Wait the de-aged Nier?
[1:58:08] <%patriotrenegade> Pushing! Pulling! Shoving! Thinking! Jumping! Box puzzles!
[1:58:09] <%The_Gaming_Karp> they*
[1:58:11] <%czeekytv> @ShinobiPhoenix it kinda looks like it was made a few hundred years ago, still well into the apocalypse
[1:58:17] <+Javaa01> @neidhardt0 Probably just twitch catching up with the stream, it can speed up the stream to catch up
[1:58:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> twitch is stupid
[1:58:23] <Broken_Sonex> @Aeogard Oh fuck off with that
[1:58:23] <%Kurokoi64> I hope Papa Neir shows up in 2Bs outfit
[1:58:27] <neidhardt0> I figured that's what it was. its fine now
[1:58:27] <%KineticZen> Warped audio means you have Low Latency Mode enabled and the stream is attempting to slightly speed up playback to catch up progress
[1:58:29] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> ahh papa nier, when an executive suggesting an idea actually turned out to be great
[1:58:30] <SulfurousAcid> maybe papa nier was the friends we made along the way
[1:58:31] <+FoolsArcade> @PatStaresAt So is there a reason why no more Pappa Nier and now we have twink Nier?
[1:58:34] <%depotagents> @The_Gaming_Karp nier was like that in the original japanese version. papa nier was western release only.
[1:58:35] <Visorak6> It plays at 103% speed until you catch up
[1:58:35] <%the22cstomp> you dont have to reload the page, you can switch qualities and it fixes it
[1:58:37] <%BoxNavy> oh god it does
[1:58:40] <Basch71> Kinda?
[1:58:41] <+dotrook> in an interview, the developer of the remake said, he wanted this game to be the way he remembered nier.
[1:58:41] <$Ziegsy> get her permission first, before you reload the paige
[1:58:41] <%czeekytv> true
[1:58:42] <%caramelatte1> Little bit
[1:58:42] <Profmcstevie> not a bug, feature. It's catchup, but just awfully implemented
[1:58:42] <%walternatorz> I can see it
[1:58:45] <%BoxNavy> the aetheryte plaza yeah
[1:58:45] <BigHugs> If the audio sounds distorted try disabling and enabling low latency mode
[1:58:45] <+Pengers> i see that
[1:58:46] <%ringabal> Little bit, yeah
[1:58:46] <%SunnyVarietyPack> yea it does
[1:58:46] <+glgzephyr> new shit!
[1:58:47] <%barkon345> the songs are arranged differently and just don't hit as hard as the original tracks. but ill admit this track slaps
[1:58:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah I thought the same
[1:58:47] <%Agami23> if you use BTTV or FFZ you can reset the player to fix it as well.
[1:58:49] <%Maids4lyfe> huh
[1:58:52] <+GigaSeifer> you mean the crystarium looked like this
[1:58:54] <%TheLemuroid> What was the worst section of the original game?
[1:58:54] <nevan_44> i see it
[1:58:56] <%SunnyVarietyPack> didnt think of that but you are right
[1:59:01] <+Javaa01> @the22cstomp Pausing and starting is also enough
[1:59:02] <Ubu2933> Yeaaaaaah now thay you mention it, probably they are both based of some crazy arboritums
[1:59:03] <%Aeogard> @Broken_Sonex  LUL
[1:59:03] <ZE_Count> How is the nier so far PAT?
[1:59:06] <majindusto> You need to get over Papa Nier...He had his time. NOW ITS BROTHER  NIER TIME
[1:59:07] <+dotrook> so, that it feels like how you remembered nier, means he did a good job
[1:59:07] <%Maids4lyfe> WHAT IF 14 WAS IN THE SAME UNIVERSE
[1:59:09] <%czeekytv> @barkon345 this track and the subsequent battle music work well together oddly enough
[1:59:09] <SomeAsianDood> Fishing @TheLemuroid
[1:59:10] <+TheotherKristian> auto run is changed in game
[1:59:10] <+glgzephyr> that loop bridge wasn't there before
[1:59:12] <+megaman_sentinel> i refreshan got a ad lol
[1:59:18] <%czeekytv> TOO HIGH
[1:59:19] <pixelkenj> I did that too in this exact spot
[1:59:21] <CappuccinoGuil> why is he not picking up the herb medicine?
[1:59:21] <%Mendin> Hahaha yesss
[1:59:23] <neidhardt0> This song actually sounds almost exactly the same, except for a new part added in
[1:59:23] <+midnightlace6> darksouls
[1:59:25] <ZE_Count> IS Nier Good?
[1:59:26] <%Valdorick> @TheLemuroid Most people say its the Forest
[1:59:26] <Profmcstevie> FULL SPEED
[1:59:26] <$Ziegsy> @gigaseifer when did 14.1 come out?
[1:59:29] <%Maids4lyfe> but I don't want femboy nier
[1:59:31] <%Mendin> I joked about this place being The Pendants but now you all see
[1:59:35] <pixelkenj> Look at those shelves
[1:59:39] <TheRealNumberJ42> you can only carry like 10 herbs @CappuccinoGuil
[1:59:40] <%Mendin> @CappuccinoGuil 1i0 item max limit
[1:59:40] <%czeekytv> oh weird, on PC the sensitivity as max is like lightspeed
[1:59:40] <%bread_assassin> Could you always swap between weapons on the fly? I don't remember that from the original release.
[1:59:42] <SulfurousAcid> Pat bouta give everyone motion sickness from the motion blur
[1:59:42] <%Agami23> @CappuccinoGuil theres a cap of 10
[1:59:47] <majindusto> TOO BAD
[1:59:48] <OneThousandTomatoes> @megaman_sentinel I think pausing and playing resets to without ads
[1:59:52] <%hoodedlefty> I see it, reminds me of the area around the aetherite and the inn
[1:59:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> you can just turn off auto run
[1:59:53] <Chester_goes_Berserk> @TheLemuroid First few hours, game saves the really good stuff for later
[1:59:54] <SolumFuturae> 11's and their motion sickness
[1:59:55] <%BoxNavy> dont worry about the carboard boxes in this ancient world
[1:59:55] <Broken_Sonex> @Aeogard Like that's such an overused thing to say that i stop thinking it's a legitimate complaint
[1:59:59] <%linSP> how are those boxes
[1:59:59] <CappuccinoGuil> @TheRealNumberJ42 gotcha
[2:00:00] <$Mudze7> Japanese players famously did not get along well with moving the camera
[2:00:02] <lemon_lover28> whoa! is this Pat from Pat Stares at playing Nier Replicant??
[2:00:14] <Profmcstevie> Maybe it comes from the Japanese slow adaptation to 3D control, motion sickness and the like
[2:00:17] <pi_in_the_sci> and he still misses a box
[2:00:19] <neidhardt0> you can change sensitivity in the menu I think
[2:00:21] <RWLJr98> Is that a racism joke Pat? Kappa
[2:00:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> and you can pause and play on mobile with the mini-player
[2:00:22] <pixelkenj> Im sure Yonah went past this bronzed locked door
[2:00:31] <%Mendin> ...You know, I think I like the original version of this theme more. A bit less chorus, a little deeper chanting
[2:00:33] <ZE_Count> So game good?
[2:00:33] <%Aeogard> @Broken_Sonex But the tracks sound completely different and have different tones with different overlapping melodies, I think it changes the experience a lot imo
[2:00:36] <cardamomo88> this is good
[2:00:42] <SulfurousAcid> it locked behind her, duh
[2:00:43] <Broken_Sonex> Shhhhhh don't worry about that
[2:00:45] <%walternatorz> she just moved the blocks, duh
[2:00:47] <BambooBachelor> how do yona solve block puzzle
[2:00:47] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that's what I said
[2:00:48] <yourliteraldog> It was those dirty shades
[2:00:48] <+robertoszek> and japanese games often have readjusting cameras that follow the player character, seems like they don't like to move the camera around
[2:00:50] <%Valdorick> Considering she's knocked out when you find her... she likely didn't come here on her own.
[2:00:50] <%The_Gaming_Karp> She greased herself up and slid into the cracks..
[2:00:53] <%bread_assassin> I always thought Yonah was attacked by shades and they brought her here.
[2:00:55] <Ciglossonjr> I love the blood
[2:00:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> maybe they didn't attack her....

[2:01:44] <%livlinn> 1000years old cardboard boxes???
[2:01:45] <StarMechV> A lot of people theorize that Japanese players or developers took harder to adjust to free form cameras than Americans, so it may explain why sensibility tends to be slower than wester games. Back in the day western PS1 games had their cameras adjusted JUST cause the Japanese had trouble understanding the concept of a freeform camera. Spyro 1 was infamous for flat out REMOVING the right stick camera in japan
[2:01:45] <FirewallStorm> booooo
[2:01:46] <%Aeogard> @Broken_Sonex If you've played or listened to the original game recently you'd notice the difference quite easily imo

[2:02:47] <+robertoszek> @StarMechV very interesting!
[2:02:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> yep
[2:02:50] <Broken_Sonex> @FoxInABeret GET IT? Because she has a penis. I get it.
[2:02:50] <SomeAsianDood> Yup. @televisedrevolting
[2:02:52] <%czeekytv> @arcielardor Joe Rogan can suck it
[2:02:52] <Profmcstevie> Anime dash, verb, forcefully moving forward "cos I want to"
[2:02:53] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Absolutely evil - no question.
[2:02:56] <gslayer14> DESTROY THE CHILD
[2:02:56] <$Mudze7> murder the chil- monsters
[2:02:56] <LorcaNomad> the music transitions are FUCKING FLAWLESS
[2:02:58] <primarch_lupercal> apparently the auto combat makes you do sick anime shit
[2:02:58] <+TheotherKristian> I'm gonna attribute many of the nice animations to the Taura Touch
[2:02:58] <SulfurousAcid> all shades are evil, duh
[2:02:58] <%SilvaChariot0133> No think, only kill Kappa
[2:02:58] <+PrimalDweeb> They will soon enough.
[2:03:00] <%Treuan> There's no other way
[2:03:01] <Mr_JustinJones> kill them all, peter
[2:03:03] <gslayer14> CORRUPT THEM ALL
[2:03:06] <olm46> And easy to kill
[2:03:06] <%EynosStyles> evil children who probably have DUI's
[2:03:07] <filialpails> they look like monsters to you?
[2:03:08] <+robosqueeb> there will be no shade sympathizing in this chat
[2:03:08] <%TimetodiveLTX> corrupt them all
[2:03:08] <NekoUrabe> :)
[2:03:10] <MKII> we're about to level up and they look like just about enough exp

[2:03:18] <$Mudze7> oh dang
[2:03:18] <neidhardt0> This is one of the songs actually better than the original. i'll stand by that.
[2:03:18] <%SilvaChariot0133> lytEYES
[2:03:19] <@Pandora_Prime> They made the music BETTER?
[2:03:20] <yourliteraldog> We can kill Guilty Children
[2:03:21] <televisedrevolting> Fair enough. Dark evil must be killed.
[2:03:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> they attacked you in the beginning
[2:03:24] <Tonicky > Evil never attacks
[2:03:29] <ProfessorLitmus> john madden john madden john madden john madden john madden john madden john madden....
[2:03:29] <FirewallStorm> well they're going to have to start attacking soon enough
[2:03:29] <blackbookalpha> business as usual with Pat destroying tiny shades
[2:03:30] <%SilvaChariot0133> veiWow
[2:03:32] <+chaumiester> How's the game so far Chat? Good or bad?
[2:03:35] <%KineticZen> Some of it
[2:03:37] <+Jack8274> Should I buy this?
[2:03:41] <OneThousandTomatoes> good
[2:03:46] <%ringabal> Hayai
[2:03:48] <%Valdorick> Remember, the greatest Evil is to do nothing Kappa
[2:03:49] <CappuccinoGuil> @FoxInABeret you're losing me LUL
[2:03:52] <%SilvaChariot0133> Clunky on PC, but good
[2:03:57] <ZE_Count> how busted is the PC version?
[2:03:57] <%EynosStyles> good
[2:04:03] <%barkon345> @glgzephyr its not that the music in this version is bad its just that some of the tracks are not nearly as good as the masterpieces in the orginal
[2:04:09] <%BoxNavy> @Jack8274 if you have a ps4 or ps5 then yeah. pc version is wonky apparently
[2:04:20] <%linSP> how did this sick girl even
[2:04:25] <Man_in_the_Red> oh Japan, you and your shitty PC Ports, oh you
[2:04:25] <%Aeogard> @barkon345 e x a c t l y. This music is still 8-9/10
[2:04:26] <%the22cstomp> new sword just dropped
[2:04:27] <%Valdorick> 'dagger'
[2:04:29] <TheRealNumberJ42> ugly? how dare you
[2:04:30] <%linSP> look at that piece of shit
[2:04:31] <SulfurousAcid> it's so ugly, it's great
[2:04:32] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Ew I hate it.
[2:04:32] <FoxInABeret> @CappuccinoGuil What I said might mean something different than what you think it means.
[2:04:32] <+chaumiester> Oh fuck, it's clunky on PC again? Just like Automata?
[2:04:35] <%BoxNavy> the kurt cobain dagger
[2:04:36] <SomeAsianDood> wow that looks terrible
[2:04:38] <deviljhojho_> its one of those flamberge looking asses
[2:04:39] <neidhardt0> oh btw finishers are still in the game when enemies are down
[2:04:42] <%ringabal> It's no Dream Needle, that's for sure
[2:04:42] <+PrimalDweeb> Yeah, it's ugly.
[2:04:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> apparently if you cap pc at 60 its fine, but you have to go out of the way
[2:04:48] <radioamnesiac> @linSP i assume she was kidnapped as she stepped through the door
[2:04:49] <kingdinkyI> Buy the game so they can remake Drakengard
[2:04:50] <ZE_Count> its like a wide kris sword
[2:04:50] <%Deft_Thought> It's like a Flamberge but a dagger
[2:04:54] <%radda343> but number go up
[2:04:55] <yourliteraldog> It looks like a wizard hat
[2:04:56] <deviljhojho_> or whats the name? jaggedy boys? not flamberges
[2:05:07] <%Agami23> did shades always burn in sunlight like that??
[2:05:16] <%EynosStyles> @barkon345 I feel like their experience with automata under their belt. the most for this game should be just as good
[2:05:17] <Profmcstevie> SEARING sunlight
[2:05:17] <%Valdorick> Kris?
[2:05:18] <%patriotrenegade> Its from Drakengard I think. It's an oversized version of a real life Kris dagger @PatStaresAt
[2:05:19] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Shades deserve it because they're ugly
[2:05:21] <$Ziegsy> yeah they did
[2:05:22] <%linSP> thick dick
[2:05:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> flame burgers
[2:05:25] <%EynosStyles> music
[2:05:26] <%BoxNavy> YEEEEEAH
[2:05:27] <%Deft_Thought> THICKtionary Kreygasm
[2:05:27] <tattleworm> those slash effects are gonna make it real hard to use spears
[2:05:27] <TheRealNumberJ42> LUL
[2:05:27] <deviljhojho_> THE BLOOMO
[2:05:28] <$Mudze7> @OneThousandTomatoes other way around, caps at 60 by default, if you go out of your way to uncap it it goes crazy
[2:05:29] <Blackarrow1212> bloom
[2:05:29] <yourliteraldog> BLOOM
[2:05:29] <Defm551> is this a remake of nier?

[2:05:57] <FirewallStorm> MORE
[2:05:59] <%TheBensonator_> Forget the thicctionary, how about the beef on that bloom? woolieGASM
[2:05:59] <%Monkeyweed21> OWW I LOVE IT
[2:06:00] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt the bloom generators just needed some time to warm up
[2:06:00] <BambooBachelor> Can't believe this used to be a Chile's
[2:06:01] <skyentombment> Careful it doesnt fuck your tv up pat
[2:06:06] <Man_in_the_Red> @chaumiester weird considering FF14 n 15 royal
[2:06:12] <%TimetodiveLTX> imaging air raving to commit war crimes
[2:06:17] <softbirby> Can you have two weapons equiped in this game? i forget
[2:06:25] <+robertoszek> the exaggerated animations for opening doors do make more sense for boy Nier
[2:06:28] <%The_Gaming_Karp> I don't think sooo?
[2:06:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> actually these are just regular crimes nvm
[2:06:34] <TheRealNumberJ42> this theme zooms
[2:06:38] <stevenellis386> so that is not my internet failing to buffer the stream, thats just the game!? YIKES
[2:06:40] <%13ry4n93> so what's the difference between this version and the old one?
[2:06:46] <blackbookalpha> murder crimes
[2:06:47] <yourliteraldog> Whats that smell
[2:06:48] <+chaumiester> @Man_in_the_Red they completely abandon Automata for like 3 years after they gave it one update. Never fixing the issues
[2:06:51] <%Monkeyweed21> you didnt before
[2:06:51] <%czeekytv> did you always track blood?
[2:06:54] <%EynosStyles> drench in the blood of the fallen
[2:06:56] <+rbakervv> @13ry4n93 brand new combat engine
[2:06:56] <+Javaa01> @13ry4n93 Plays better, looks better
[2:06:57] <OneThousandTomatoes> gameplay is good
[2:07:02] <xxshadowxx416> when does the dark night come in or the black mage were the healer
[2:07:04] <%EthorXL> EthorXL subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! Never watched the old Nier LP but hype to get to see it now!
[2:07:05] <%sniffy77> bluuud
[2:07:07] <%linSP> but how ghost have blood!
[2:07:11] <%rkbinder> rkbinder subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 6 month streak! Starting to get below 20 degrees here in Australia, time for the jumpers and ugg boots.
[2:07:13] <%TimetodiveLTX> all lines voices, apparently
[2:07:15] <yourliteraldog> Doing the ol
[2:07:16] <Mr_JustinJones> why would ghosts have blood? hrmm
[2:07:16] <%Monkeyweed21> thats new
[2:07:17] <cardamomo88> so pretty red
[2:07:19] <%ringabal> Clearly it's Dark Blood
[2:07:20] <FirewallStorm> the blood of the evil
[2:07:24] <%The_Gaming_Karp> No not the shadelings!
[2:07:26] <%Valdorick> Reminder, running with blood on your boots is a good way to slip and eat shit.
[2:07:27] <brainflint> are there any changes in the game from the og ?
[2:07:34] <%bigbrothergannon> tracking blood is metal
[2:07:43] <%13ry4n93> @The_Gaming_Karp Especially the shadelings
[2:07:46] <blackbookalpha> I bought this on steam and my GTX 1080 can barely run it on medium
[2:07:50] <%arcielardor> hey Pat, how'd you do that arial combo
[2:07:50] <+evbites> Fishing is a bitch
[2:07:52] <Man_in_the_Red> @brainflint other than combat, not thqt we know of
[2:07:55] <+chaumiester> @Valdorick speaking from exp?

[2:08:31] <olm46> They're distracted by your fashion sense
[2:08:31] <cardamomo88> bloom me pat
[2:08:32] <%weissguard> In the words of Steve Harvey: "YES! YES!....KIIIILLL!"
[2:08:34] <+PrimalDweeb> When you counter, use the Triangle button instead; it's stronger.
[2:08:36] <$Futurecity10> honestly you're doing them a favor
[2:08:36] <gslayer14> Hans.... are we the baddies?
[2:08:37] <%livlinn> NotLikeThis
[2:08:39] <%solracc25> stomp it
[2:08:39] <%BoxNavy> weird. the smaller ones in this area were swinging at me
[2:08:39] <+senfood> Dew it.
[2:08:41] <+IAmSkeleton> this OST though
[2:08:42] <TonberryLives> That will definitely not come up.
[2:08:43] <Zourath> Probably trying to suck your soul out.
[2:08:44] <+warlockwithapixie> But kill them anyway tho...
[2:08:45] <+robosqueeb> they dont attack...theyre plotting something...
[2:08:46] <%patriotrenegade> only the kids dont attack
[2:08:47] <Broken_Sonex> KILL THEM ALLLLLL AHAHAHA
[2:08:47] <%BoxNavy> uh oh
[2:08:48] <%ringabal> PERFECT
[2:08:51] <%neroforte177> ...why dont the enemies attack you
[2:08:54] <Vertigheist> Not attacking? Definitely evil
[2:08:58] <Laecerelius> Even the women and children!!
[2:08:59] <+zuzuxiv> good camera
[2:09:01] <TheRealNumberJ42> cuz spoilers
[2:09:01] <+evbites> 3 rainbow trout
[2:09:03] <Profmcstevie> They'll just grow up and strike up against us, remember your Villainy 101: No survivors
[2:09:03] <OneThousandTomatoes> its an invisible attack
[2:09:04] <olm46> They're biding their time
[2:09:06] <pixelkenj> self quarantine
[2:09:07] <%EynosStyles> why is this chat so bloodthirsty lol
[2:09:08] <%ringabal> @neroforte177 Don't worry about it
[2:09:11] <mass1997> Wait are spoilers allowed in chat?
[2:09:12] <%bigben01> Big brain Pat
[2:09:13] <CappuccinoGuil> @neroforte177 must be a glitch
[2:09:13] <+SaltyTheRower> Only good guys shoot first
[2:09:16] <cardamomo88> puzzel
[2:09:20] <%linSP> worth it!
[2:09:21] <$Ziegsy> its the bait for the naaty back attack
[2:09:22] <MKII> You know what this game needed? A shade kill counter at the end
[2:09:24] <%EynosStyles> @mass1997 big no
[2:09:31] <+Javaa01> Grats on the rare Medicinal Herb drop
[2:09:32] <%thetunnelhomer> Oh man those early 10s weapon designs are really terrible.
[2:09:33] <+PrimalDweeb> Murder is the way.
[2:09:34] <%Piemen99> time stop
[2:09:34] <%BoxNavy> @neroforte177 its a legit bug
[2:09:40] <Vertigheist> Good people kill first, that’s how we Americans got so great
[2:09:41] <Ultimatefool> I love how they kept the level design JUST as shitty as it was @PatStaresAt
[2:09:48] <%MelBrooksKA> Your arms are still too baby bitch
[2:09:50] <%The_Gaming_Karp> The more I look at that sword the angrier it makes me.
[2:09:55] <mass1997> Ok because people are NOT being subtle
[2:09:55] <CappuccinoGuil> @mass1997 lots of people are experiencing this for the 1st time
[2:09:58] <%13ry4n93> @BoxNavy be great if it wasn't
[2:09:58] <a_mad_dragon_> he doesn't know how to puh blocks yet
[2:10:05] <blackbookalpha> RIP Banana hair
[2:10:05] <Profmcstevie> Searing white load screens, my favoooourite
[2:10:09] <Broken_Sonex> @The_Gaming_Karp Why?
[2:10:10] <+evbites> 4 rainbowtrout
[2:10:12] <OneThousandTomatoes> this isn't a spoiler free zone
[2:10:27] <%linSP> HOW did they build ANY of the blighttowns
[2:10:31] <cardamomo88> aliens...
[2:10:35] <%13ry4n93> oh god, the bloom
[2:10:36] <olm46> It's kind of a medium spoiler permission because people still wanna talk about the game.
[2:10:40] <%BoxNavy> @13ry4n93 ☝️ ;) shhhh
[2:10:43] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> oh that shade not attacking is not a bug, it's the same in the original
[2:10:44] <%ringabal> Look at these penthouses
[2:10:49] <%The_Gaming_Karp> It's so short and stubby, like a roman pugio but impractically thick. It just doesn't feel useful.
[2:10:53] <waffleandman> i wouldnt look at this stream if you dont want spoilers
[2:10:54] <blackbookalpha> lighting and color also better
[2:10:54] <%13ry4n93> @cardamomo88 nah, those came later
[2:10:56] <%EynosStyles> Warning! Speak spoiler get banned
[2:11:00] <SulfurousAcid> I hate finding an antidote in games, cuz that means there's poison
[2:11:11] <+evbites> 5 trout
[2:11:16] <%Piemen99> How long has the world been like this?
[2:11:17] <$Mudze7> same convo
[2:11:17] <+PrimalDweeb> Agreed.
[2:11:19] <%valriot> You said this in the old LP as wwell LUL
[2:11:24] <Profmcstevie> Far removed from society
[2:11:25] <+Birdigalore> You talked about this during the playthrough too!
[2:11:25] <%BoxNavy> yeah its rad. monster hunter is one of those
[2:11:26] <blackbookalpha> post SQUARED apocalypse
[2:11:26] <FoxInABeret> 10000% agree
[2:11:27] <+robosqueeb> I do love a good reclaimed Earth
[2:11:28] <Man_in_the_Red> im a fan of SMT 4's Post Post Post Apocalypse
[2:11:28] <%Fooguwu> Talked about this last time too
[2:11:30] <blackbaron98> Society no more Setting
[2:11:30] <%13ry4n93> so llike new vegas?
[2:11:31] <TheRealNumberJ42> this box animation has nothing on papa nier
[2:11:31] <%thetunnelhomer> New Vegas is the best post-post apocalypse.
[2:11:31] <ZE_Count> Like warhammer fantasy first the alien invasion then a demon invashion
[2:11:31] <%Kurokoi64> Horizon Zero Dawn
[2:11:32] <%linSP> dark souls 3?
[2:11:33] <Veluren> The full Rebuilding phase, like what Horizon did
[2:11:33] <Blank9> breath of the wild did that well
[2:11:33] <+R0DA> post post apocalypse is like the best genre
[2:11:34] <%BogBodyPositive> I'm writing a book in that time range!
[2:11:35] <Tonicky > there is a bath tub somewhere nearby
[2:11:35] <+warlockwithapixie> its FINE
[2:11:36] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Solid setting
[2:11:37] <%NitronStreams> The Apocalypse had an Apocalypse and this is where we are
[2:11:37] <%Kurokoi64> shits good
[2:11:38] <SomeAsianDood> Like 2 days @Piemen99  Kappa
[2:11:38] <Yakobro> @Piemen99 it all went to shit 1000 years ago
[2:11:39] <%13ry4n93> people are starting to rebuild?
[2:11:40] <%ringabal> YEAH the block pushing is still awful!
[2:11:40] <%barkon345> @EynosStyles But Pat is speaking spoilers
[2:11:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Chris Avelone HATES IT
[2:11:41] <SulfurousAcid> I gotta beat smt 4 yet
[2:11:41] <LorcaNomad> It doesn't even matter
[2:11:43] <xxshadowxx416> @eynosstyles but pat said
[2:11:43] <CappuccinoGuil> Imagine Fallout 5000 years later, it'd be rad
[2:11:47] <%Wallabri> i too love Seasons of Hieron
[2:11:54] <TheRealNumberJ42> LUL
[2:11:54] <%Valdorick> RIP the Roman Empire.
[2:11:55] <+pectusumbra> Big agreed. Big reason I love the Etrian Odyssey series
[2:12:00] <$Afterman_> god i love post-post apocalypse situations
[2:12:02] <stukamod> The end of Hokuto no Ken?
[2:12:02] <%Piemen99> @Yakobro sweet
[2:12:06] <%EynosStyles> @barkon345 ban pat then
[2:12:07] <Mr_JustinJones> So you like enslaved, right Pat?
[2:12:07] <%thelaxinator> they toned down the ridiculously detailed block pushing animation huh?
[2:12:08] <Profmcstevie> The west is filled with annihilations
[2:12:12] <@commanderclaw> No, we're living in the Pre Apocalypse. The end is nigh!
[2:12:12] <Tonicky > those scratches on the floor leading you lol
[2:12:14] <+evbites> 6 t
[2:12:14] <+zuzuxiv> oh yeah
[2:12:15] <%valriot> That... wasnt an apocalypse LUL
[2:12:17] <%Mendin> @PatStaresAt Hey while we're here, Muffins are Cakes
[2:12:17] <%linSP> yeah but post post doesnt even care about what caused the apocalypse
[2:12:18] <%Kurokoi64> Or like the post post post apocalypse, if u believe in the Biblical Flood lol
[2:12:20] <+The_Gaming_Karp> Millenarian sects were fun too
[2:12:21] <+robosqueeb> I only like pre post apocalypse settings
[2:12:21] <OneThousandTomatoes> LUL
[2:12:21] <xxshadowxx416> to end of ww2
[2:12:22] <%solracc25> apoca- what? It always has been like this
[2:12:24] <%13ry4n93> and don't forget the bronze age collapse!
[2:12:25] <blackbaron98> The dark ages were the apocalipse
[2:12:25] <OneThousandTomatoes> damn it
[2:12:27] <teefpal> Damn I just got through looking at the ending to AOT
[2:12:28] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> rome was post-apocalyptic rebuilding from the bronze age collapse
[2:12:31] <+Birdigalore> We're in the period where the end of the world isnt close, but you can absolutely see it from here lol
[2:12:35] <+Ir0nAgr0> Were living there compared to the dinosaurs
[2:12:35] <%walternatorz> I'm sure a little girl could have made that jump.
[2:12:38] <teefpal> Woolie would love it
[2:12:42] <%Monkeyweed21> aww the double jump isnt a dumb chest thrust
[2:12:47] <%thetunnelhomer> I'd classify modern day as a "Boring Dystopia."
[2:12:50] <TonberryLives> Honestly I would argue we're living in a dark age despite the ready availability of knowledge.
[2:12:52] <blackbookalpha> Dinosaurs: yeah we know
[2:12:55] <LorcaNomad> god I fucking love this music
[2:12:56] <%The_Gaming_Karp> If there were an apolcalyptic event to speak of in the west, I would suggest the Black Death
[2:12:57] <yourliteraldog> There is evidence to suggest the Human race has been close to exctintion at least once
[2:12:58] <teefpal> Climate change is the literal boiling pot
[2:13:00] <olm46> The sword fits papa Nier
[2:13:01] <%EynosStyles> just use dlc sword
[2:13:04] <%Monkeyweed21> @teefpal thank you hitler for doing it all for our sakes
[2:13:04] <SolumFuturae> LUL
[2:13:04] <%ringabal> Whoops
[2:13:05] <Profmcstevie> If any Dinosaurs saw the world today they'd have an existential crisis the likes the world has never seen
[2:13:05] <CappuccinoGuil> That's kinda why I love Ashen. It's the end of the universe like in Dark Souls, but everyone just decides to build shit again. Wild.
[2:13:05] <Blackarrow1212> LUL
[2:13:09] <%AyotoCorp> F
[2:13:09] <%BoxNavy> its a dagger that they ctrl+t'd in photoshop
[2:13:11] <%BogBodyPositive> Thank you, its gonna be how everyones kinda disabled but its seen as normal and the world is accommodating
[2:13:12] <Dragovus> Found the exit
[2:13:14] <%13ry4n93> ha
[2:13:14] <%DaRyeBeachHood> DaRyeBeachHood subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 10 months! Here's hoping we get rerecorded lines for Papa NieR
[2:13:15] <%Valdorick> Though strictly speaking, for humanity as a whole, the only apocalypse we've had was the Ice Age and subsequent great thaw.
[2:13:18] <Ultimatefool> @Monkeyweed21 Always saw it as a weird hip thrust, like he's humping the air LUL
[2:13:23] <+evbites> 7
[2:13:30] <OneThousandTomatoes> birds are living in the post poat apocalypse
[2:13:31] <%13ry4n93> the  video skipping for anyone else?
[2:13:39] <+BurkeBigsby> The shorts are bothering me. Wish we had Papa Neir and his dumb shoes
[2:13:39] <yourliteraldog> Like our population was less than 4,000
[2:13:40] <teefpal> Funny, our rapid communication has only spread ignorance and hatred

[2:16:39] <neidhardt0> now they attack
[2:16:39] <radioamnesiac> i think that a lot of nier's stubbornness is more endearing as twink nier. papa nier's stubbornness is kind of sad for me.
[2:16:40] <Byorski> Do combo!
[2:16:40] <%the22cstomp> you get some fun dialogue if you let him keep talking and then say no

[2:18:09] <$RealThiele> weiss pod
[2:18:13] <%barkon345> when I heard they were re recording all the voice tracks I figured there was no way they could capture the magic of their previous performances, and I happily stand corrected
[2:18:16] <+wizard_of_diamonds> That makes no damn sense
[2:18:19] <%Valdorick> Sound... Power... Song.
[2:18:20] <Man_in_the_Red> i dont remember those sound effects
[2:18:21] <teefpal> Oh its the drone thing from Automata

[2:23:24] <%czeekytv> The flaming attacks have much earlier parry windows it seems
[2:23:25] <+pectusumbra> those spell effects look rad

[2:23:36] <Tonicky > Weiss he has range moves too!

[2:23:39] <%BoxNavy> my god these 2 get it bad
[2:23:41] <penitentpendant> @Stormzcales_Lair The real question is would they go the extra mile and mod in all his old dialogue
[2:23:42] <Man_in_the_Red> @dakuu75 nearly every enemy is except the boar is
[2:23:43] <MKII> big hero
[2:23:50] <%13ry4n93> a lotta small lances

[2:24:05] <+Stormzcales_Lair> Was just wondering the voice part
[2:24:06] <%barkon345> @PrimalDweeb eh ok I just looked it  up and Gurren Lagann only came out 3 years before this game so they arent that far apart
[2:24:06] <+PrimalDweeb> The noise it makes when you absorb blood is cool.

[2:24:45] <%the22cstomp> or they kidnapped her
[2:24:49] <%GarbageNirvana> So you think they're going to try remaking Gestalt as well or nah
[2:24:49] <%Valdorick> She was knocked out, I don't think she got that far on choice.
[2:24:50] <penitentpendant> I assume someone kidnapped her
[2:24:51] <AllenDeadman> yeah

[2:38:06] <radioamnesiac> they're too busy for coops
[2:38:11] <Tonicky > This whole village relies on a 15 year old to fix all their problems. Which is one of the things that makes more sense when you were Papa Nier
[2:38:13] <%Jeshk0> oh thanks ya dumb little prick
[2:38:15] <%sniffy77> wow what a dumb kid
[2:38:20] <Vertigheist> @SomeAsianDood so like the old games?

[2:38:22] <%BoxNavy> EVERY night NotLikeThis
[2:38:29] <%The_Gaming_Karp> A lot of animals have to die.
[2:38:34] <+seiyaofabyss> that voice does NOT fit
[2:38:36] <%sniffy77> lady tell ur kids to fuck off and eat their veggies
[2:38:36] <%patriotrenegade> Mutton is shit
[2:38:37] <+warlockwithapixie> stop feeding them!
[2:38:41] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[2:38:43] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt The eggs dont glow, they are hidden in the shadows near the fountain
[2:38:46] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Did you know mutton comes from French?
[2:38:50] <Vertigheist> these old ladies sure sound young
[2:38:52] <SomeAsianDood> @Vertigheist yup the og Nier Gestalt has poopa nier. This is a remake of Replicant
[2:38:57] <pixelkenj> reload
[2:39:00] <%Deft_Thought> Feed them MEAT. My children DEMAND MEAT.
[2:39:02] <majindusto> RESET
[2:39:02] <StarMechV> Daily remidner poor Nier here had to get money so other way so these sidequests are nothing compared
[2:39:05] <SulfurousAcid> purchase wea pon?
[2:39:06] <%Garthunox> this one is repeatable
[2:39:08] <%ringabal> Remember: Don't have children!
[2:39:10] <olaksi> if the villagers are so nice you'd think someone would just take these 2 orphans in
[2:39:11] <%czeekytv> Some of the kids sound like 30 year olds
[2:39:15] <Byorski> Why does no one worry about a book just floating behind the boy?
[2:39:22] <%13ry4n93> @blaccbird914 papa nier looks like he wakes up before dawn and does back breaking labor to take care of his baby girl
[2:39:24] <+PrimalDweeb> Do you want me to tell you where the chicken egg should be?
[2:39:26] <teefpal> Yeah, its from when French was the language of the English court
[2:39:31] <+CookieCutter007> what is with Yoko Taro and flowers
[2:39:34] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Reminds me a little of the start of Last Exile
[2:39:34] <pixelkenj> :)
[2:39:39] <GrandpaPhoenix> Young nier is kind of growing on me
[2:39:44] <%barkon345> @Byorski beacuse Magic
[2:39:50] <Overhaul180> Brother Nier happy to run errands for money instead of the Other Stuff (yes that's canon)
[2:39:54] <%miguelrod777> he's a pure boy I like him
[2:39:55] <teefpal> He's gonna break like an egg
[2:39:58] <%Monkeyweed21> you got the simp sword
[2:40:11] <%Ranryu692> you can redo the quest, so get ALL the mutton
[2:40:12] <devanmuse> so idealistic... i can't wait for his spirit to break
[2:40:14] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Better sword!
[2:40:21] <Ciglossonjr> Nier isn’t pure but he is idealistic
[2:40:28] <pixelkenj> The Charge/Hold Attacks on this sword are really good for this part of the game
[2:40:34] <%logoth_> shinies should be porn like it is in Yakuza
[2:40:35] <%blaccbird914> @13ry4n93 Honestly the story works better with him, but im excited to see what theyve done with the remaster
[2:40:38] <shieldecho> @Overhaul180 I just reread that short story the other day...kid's had it rought...
[2:40:41] <+PrimalDweeb> Item shop
[2:40:47] <%Ranryu692> by the entrance to the market
[2:40:49] <%czeekytv> Item vendor at the front @PatStaresAt
[2:40:59] <+DrGlendale> the village helping out nierboy and his sister lands so much better
[2:41:23] <+Catpurnicus> how many other "Huge Nier Fan Excited To Play Game For The First Time" we got here in chat
[2:41:25] <+PrimalDweeb> Nope
[2:41:26] <%Ranryu692> nothing!
[2:41:26] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[2:41:27] <olaksi> they aren't really doing all that much to help though?
[2:41:33] <gslayer14> wack
[2:41:33] <%Treuan> Pain
[2:41:34] <+Birdigalore> You call this a video game!
[2:41:35] <+PrimalDweeb> I had the same reaction.
[2:41:36] <teefpal> It's strange that they changed the protagonist for the game so completely'
[2:41:39] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[2:41:39] <SomeAsianDood> they got really smashed
[2:41:40] <%czeekytv> I like the dad essentially being a mercenary to support himself and his daughter better
[2:41:41] <ConflagrationsGaming> @Catpurnicus aye
[2:41:41] <%Mendin> Why does the Forest of Myth have a map when it's one town
[2:41:44] <%Aeogard> certain dialogue works a lot better with young Nier but the relationship with Yonah as a whole works better as dad imo
[2:41:46] <+PrimalDweeb> You're close
[2:41:50] <%UvBenServed> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:41:55] <%psidefx> Shadow eggs
[2:41:59] <+PrimalDweeb> Bingo
[2:42:00] <+Catpurnicus> I want to see if they change the tree section at all
[2:42:04] <+Catpurnicus> I hope not
[2:42:04] <pixelkenj> ez
[2:42:10] <%BoxNavy> @Catpurnicus does "watching pats lp and clemps' videos" fall into that category
[2:42:10] <Ultimatefool> @teefpal Wasn't really changed per se, this is the protagonist that Japan played in their version of the game
[2:42:11] <%radda343> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhand
[2:42:15] <yourliteraldog> Camo eggs
[2:42:15] <+Catpurnicus> YES
[2:42:16] <devanmuse> @catpurnicus I don't even play it. i just experience the story vicariously
[2:42:21] <olm46> Good
[2:42:23] <StarMechV> Niiice
[2:42:25] <Man_in_the_Red> considering Papa Nier recycles everything from lines to mocap the change isnt that drastic LUL
[2:42:25] <AllenDeadman> egggg
[2:42:26] <+zuzuxiv> omfg
[2:42:27] <Saltmeisterr> SICK
[2:42:29] <TonberryLives> FUCK YES
[2:42:32] <Tonicky > Good!
[2:42:33] <NDenizen> Text-only sequences have basically become a staple in the series now
[2:42:37] <+Birdigalore> The shadowlord is playing easter egg hunt!
[2:42:40] <Tonicky > Love the tree part
[2:42:42] <%Ranryu692> @Ultimatefool if they played the PS3 version. 360 had Papa Nier
[2:42:42] <%Agami23> look at all those thickens
[2:42:55] <pixelkenj> There is one change I noticed after the Aerie
[2:42:58] <%Valdorick> "I slapped a wall with a tapered rope and a T-bone steak fell out"
[2:42:59] <+BurkeBigsby> Fools, just put an object that resembles an egg and chickens will lay there.
[2:43:03] <teefpal> Yeah but imagine someone replace Kiryu in Yakuza and made them an teenager for loc purposes
[2:43:11] <unrelenting0> I recall the Best Friends Nier LP never found the Chicken Eggs.
[2:43:17] <radioamnesiac> @Aeogard i think the relationship works differently. it's more tragic with papa nier. it's just idealistic and optimistic with brother nier. i think both are great.
[2:43:20] <+PrimalDweeb> Want to fight a shade that can one shot you if you're not careful?
[2:43:22] <+ApocalypticExpress> finally started shadowbringers and the game immediately stabbed me in the heart multiple times
[2:43:43] <%solracc25> nobody cares much for the floating speaking book huh?
[2:43:44] <%czeekytv> @ApocalypticExpress just wait untiil 5.3 :)
[2:43:49] <Big_Dream> god i forgot having billion saves was necessary
[2:43:51] <%Valdorick> I recall in the Best Friends Nier LP, they did most of the starter Sidequests off screen.
[2:43:52] <NDenizen> @teefpal: As long as everyone continues to treat him like an adult man and never acknowledges it
[2:43:54] <+zuzuxiv> @ApocalypticExpress yeah you have fun with that :)
[2:44:02] <majindusto> NA version  of NieR PS3 had Papa Nier too
[2:44:24] <+Goatllama> VAEVICTUS
[2:44:29] <Man_in_the_Red> wow the homing shot goes far
[2:44:32] <%Maids4lyfe> @majindusto they only had papa Nier
[2:44:33] <%TimetodiveLTX> i bet you that magic is cacinogenic
[2:44:35] <%ringabal> Hmmmmm
[2:44:37] <Big_Dream> wait you start young
[2:44:39] <%TimetodiveLTX> casinogenic, fuck it
[2:44:42] <StarMechV> CAN HE?
[2:44:44] <Big_Dream> i am confuesed
[2:44:44] <+Birdigalore> I feel like using magic to harvest sheep meat would be like using a shotgun to hunt squirrels
[2:44:51] <%Maids4lyfe> casinogenic LUL
[2:44:51] <pixelkenj> omnipotent amnesia
[2:44:53] <Big_Dream> did they change the charcter model
[2:44:55] <softbirby> is weiss really omnipotent tho
[2:45:04] <$SGrim> If you're omnipotent, Weiss, why are you a book? Checkmate.
[2:45:07] <olaksi> @Birdigalore so effective?
[2:45:09] <CatRidder> PAT bring back papa nier
[2:45:09] <teefpal> Yes
[2:45:10] <%DaRyeBeachHood> this dialog was so good with Papa
[2:45:12] <%EynosStyles> you not really omnipotent if you forgotten your own shit
[2:45:15] <%ringabal> Remember kids, magical incantations increase your likelihood for cancer.
[2:45:16] <Botman_R> Costs more mana, though.
[2:45:16] <$RealThiele> omniimpotent
[2:45:18] <%NitronStreams> man these convos were funnier with old man nier
[2:45:18] <+PrimalDweeb> You move much slower when you charge
[2:45:19] <GeltonZ> @Big_Dream Older Nier is "Nier Gestalt". This is "Nier Replicant". Basically they were "made for America" and "made for Japan" versions.
[2:45:23] <+BurkeBigsby> You can use a shotgun to hunt squirrels. Birdshot exists.
[2:45:24] <unrelenting0> Stronger Dark Blasts was a thing in Automata too...but only if you upgraded the Pods.  The hardest thing to upgrade in the game.
[2:45:29] <teefpal> Turning Point Gestalt
[2:45:36] <+HeroSolaire> I think he is omnipotent in the sense he can summon bunch of power out of nowhere
[2:45:39] <Man_in_the_Red> @sgrim "the script to the game is in these pages... somewhere"
[2:45:41] <%logoth_> firing eldritch lasers at livestock
[2:45:54] <%linSP> guns dont kill, books do
[2:45:56] <Tonicky > at least it is quick
[2:45:56] <NDenizen> this new rendition is really good
[2:45:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> LUL
[2:46:01] <%solracc25> *omnipotent but can't cure one anime girl
[2:46:09] <Byorski> Cooked, too!
[2:46:14] <%ShinobiPhoenix> straight up, the boar hits like a truck and if you're attacking it, the charge is FRAME ZERO
[2:46:14] <teefpal> oh no poor sheepies
[2:46:19] <%13ry4n93> jeez
[2:46:24] <%logoth_> psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead psaCrazyhead
[2:46:24] <+Gespens> Kick da baby!
[2:46:27] <VidulaSaix> You're aware those first 2 you killed were Goat right
[2:46:27] <%13ry4n93> that's pretty violent
[2:46:29] <%EynosStyles> anime girl illness is invincible
[2:46:29] <rekinom> I want to air hike off the grimoire
[2:46:34] <VTuberEloiyse> It's "Mutti".
[2:46:34] <+XIR0> goats aren't sheep pat
[2:46:35] <+BurkeBigsby> Weren't there vocals to this song?
[2:46:38] <%ringabal> Knowledge is power, and power leads to the Dark Side
[2:46:41] <devanmuse> those first two were goats, not sheep
[2:46:42] <unrelenting0> @ShinobiPhoenix Monster Hunter fans will know the pain of Frame Zero charges.
[2:47:00] <%13ry4n93> doggo
[2:47:04] <%Carquar> Really wish I had gotten this on console. I'm super disappointed in the PC release.
[2:47:04] <majindusto> @Maids4lyfe Thats  what i was getting  at...Papa Nier was the only way in English ...Japan  had Brother NIER (PS3) and Papa NIER (Xbox)
[2:47:10] <Man_in_the_Red> and 6 frame hip checks
[2:47:17] <AerisRoivas> How far in is he? I just got here
[2:47:19] <Big_Dream> you look like 9s and it makes me mad
[2:47:20] <teefpal> Anime girl illness is great for not having female characters who do things and have agency.
[2:47:25] <%EynosStyles> that's what this game needs. it needs doggo
[2:47:26] <+Gespens> frame 6 hip checks with hit boxes behind it
[2:47:29] <kamen_advent> How's the remake so far?
[2:47:35] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I learned to see the charge if you look at its back right foot
[2:47:36] <%13ry4n93> @majindusto we got the best version
[2:47:47] <%Maids4lyfe> @majindusto my bad, I misunderstood you
[2:47:51] <$realm_forge> Zangeif doesn’t sleep he turns into a liquid every 16 hours
[2:47:54] <GeltonZ> @Carquar Oh? What's up with the PC release?
[2:47:59] <%czeekytv> the boar makes a large snorting sound before it charges
[2:47:59] <amonimis> wonder how quickly the community will come up with a fix for pc port LUL
[2:48:02] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but there is a cheat for the boar I had to find quickly, but back accident
[2:48:11] <%EynosStyles> @teefpal I can agree to that
[2:48:13] <%ShinobiPhoenix> but by accident
[2:48:20] <%linSP> is it a stable 60 on ps5?
[2:48:20] <%czeekytv> The PC port isn't even bad? Just cap it at 60 fps and it's fine
[2:48:22] <%justacrow84> it's even acts as an aoe
[2:48:26] <+PrimalDweeb> Twitches censoring of words they think might be bad, is really aggressive.
[2:48:27] <FirewallStorm> book requires the blood of the innocent
[2:48:32] <unrelenting0> So how much did the combat get touched up in the remake?
[2:48:32] <%13ry4n93> has pat boar drifted yet?
[2:48:35] <%Carquar> @amonimis Hopefully sooner rather than later. It's driving me nuts.
[2:48:41] <+PrimalDweeb> And mostly wrong.
[2:48:53] <%TimetodiveLTX> words can kill...
[2:48:56] <%Monkeyweed21> hey blood gems
[2:48:58] <pixelkenj> doo you prefer Words Or Chips
[2:49:10] <neidhardt0> capping the frame rate at 60 fixes the problem on pc.
[2:49:18] <%Carquar> @czeekytv It's bad. I fixed FPS but the controls are awful.
[2:49:19] <Man_in_the_Red> @unrelenting0 feels and looks much better, spear and hand are still the tits tho
[2:49:21] <majindusto> "Best" is Subjective ...I'm  just  happy we finally  get THIS version  of the game
[2:49:32] <SulfurousAcid> Pat is really confident he will defeat this boar
[2:49:35] <AerisRoivas> Wait, what were those weapons?
[2:49:42] <%czeekytv> @Carquar If you're playing M+KB then you're the problem lol
[2:49:56] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @czeekytv I don't hear a snort while slashing at him..
[2:49:57] <%EynosStyles> @aerisroivas dlc
[2:50:01] <Slimeking_Mike> Theyre like pinatas
[2:50:01] <+zuzuxiv> gimme that drakengard 3 blood
[2:50:04] <%TimetodiveLTX> i mean, it'd be nice if M+KB was an option
[2:50:05] <amonimis> @carquar wait are you playing kbm LUL
[2:50:11] <Shinjima> blood stands out IRL too
[2:50:12] <stukamod> You can almost taste it kaiouraStab
[2:50:15] <%TimetodiveLTX> is it that hard to tune for?
[2:50:22] <GeltonZ> @unrelenting0 A lot it seems. Added a launcher, air rolling replaced with a proper short air dash, and there's this "dash around" thing you can do.
[2:50:25] <+CookieCutter007> monkaS oh shit
[2:50:26] <Byorski> Hell no I dont!
[2:50:26] <bahamut1010> LUL LUL

[2:50:33] <%solracc25> ole
[2:50:33] <SomeAsianDood> The answer is no
[2:50:35] <+thatotherblackkid> Boar: Fuck your block
[2:50:39] <cardamomo88> get bork
[2:50:40] <%Ranryu692> kite it to the ravine and fight it from the other side of the bridge
[2:50:40] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I fought him without Grimoire the first few times
[2:50:41] <rasamune> whoof
[2:50:44] <%charp35> I just hid behind a rock and threw spears
[2:50:44] <pixelkenj> lance can interrupt its animations, so
[2:50:44] <%czeekytv> @ShinobiPhoenix It might not be a snort sorry, it's maybe a roar? idk but there's a sound cue
[2:50:48] <%livlinn> OhMyDog OhMyDog OhMyDog
[2:50:54] <rekinom> You can enable enemy health bars in the options @PatStaresAt
[2:50:54] <%livlinn> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[2:51:14] <hentaibou> i jumped on the rock and killed him with magic
[2:51:15] <%czeekytv> @Carquar ps5 controller on steam plugged in is working fine, idk what to tell you
[2:51:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you want, abuse the rocks in the field
[2:51:23] <majindusto> I would love a remaster like this of Drakengard 1 & 3...MAKE THEM RUN WELL FINALLY!!!
[2:51:29] <%solracc25> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead tiffosBangBang
[2:51:40] <TonberryLives> Oh that's doable
[2:51:46] <%13ry4n93> GAS GAS GAS
[2:51:52] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I actually slashed him and did melee, but I would jump on a rock to make her dizzy
[2:51:53] <%Monkeyweed21> BAIN
[2:51:55] <rasamune> Just don't get got
[2:51:55] <xinexes> when did koichi get so tall
[2:51:57] <%Carquar> @czeekytv Hm. I'm using an elite series 2. I'll look into it more.
[2:51:59] <AerisRoivas> I cheesed the heck out of this, it was a safe way of fighting it, but it took several minutes
[2:52:01] <%ssjklyco> I just camped on the rock
[2:52:05] <%13ry4n93> when can you mount the boar?
[2:52:10] <TonberryLives> GOTTA GO FAST
[2:52:11] <bahamut1010> nice dodge
[2:52:12] <pixelkenj> if you use lance to reset its animation it never attacks
[2:52:16] <%Agami23> good on you for not using the rock method.
[2:52:17] <no123450n> use your pig knowlege
[2:52:29] <rasamune> You got got
[2:52:30] <SunnySideX> holy crap the new Hills of Radiant Winds theme
[2:52:30] <bahamut1010> Jebaited
[2:52:34] <+zuzuxiv> donked
[2:52:36] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he's very distracted by the Shades
[2:52:37] <%cylish> well this looks like better combat than origionally
[2:52:38] <lemon_lover28> fool. Never take your eyes off PIG
[2:52:40] <%solracc25> counter
[2:52:41] <olaksi> "i have lost visual of the boar"
[2:52:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I killed the Shades first
[2:52:47] <%czeekytv> @Carquar weirdest part is that the icons are all xbox lol so I'm surprised an xbox controller is having problems
[2:52:49] <%AyotoCorp> That wall is real good for stunning him
[2:52:50] <OkamiDude15> @majindusto gonna need a redo the combat of 1 and the weapon leveling so you arent bashing your skull against enemies for hours on end for each weapon
[2:52:51] <shieldecho> @xinexes AsexualPride AsexualPride AsexualPride AsexualPride AsexualPride
[2:52:52] <+zuzuxiv> tbf the shades are pretty annoying
[2:53:03] <%solracc25> ole
[2:53:09] <yeeyeyee> Killing a boar in Nier is a trial everyone should undergo
[2:53:21] <amonimis> @czeekytv did you have to always launch it in big picture mode or did dualsense always work fine?
[2:53:22] <Man_in_the_Red> @okamidude15 worked just fine for every other musou made in the last decade Kappa
[2:53:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> he tended to track on me even when I dodged
[2:53:25] <pixelkenj> tee hee
[2:53:28] <Vertigheist> beat that bulldrome
[2:53:35] <%Carquar> @czeekytv Right? It's probably user error, but I've seen other complaints about it. I've just been looking forward to it, so I'm bummed
[2:53:37] <yeeyeyee> It's genuinely fucked up how hard this is in early game compared to endgame
[2:53:38] <+ReallyBigRocks> kill the piggy
[2:53:38] <%solracc25> stunlock
[2:53:39] <bahamut1010> Pog
[2:53:39] <+Deosier> boar extreme should've been the crossover trial
[2:53:40] <SulfurousAcid> nice
[2:53:41] <+zuzuxiv> yeeeeeeeee
[2:53:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> kill the boar without magic

[2:53:53] <%TimetodiveLTX> ah nier, you uhh, got something... on your...
[2:53:54] <SunnySideX> this version of the song is so much better
[2:53:58] <battlexqueen> I just dtood on the rock and shot at him till he died......
[2:53:59] <+R0DA> so is there any way to swap the magic and dodge/block buttons 'cause my fingers do not agree with the game's choices.
[2:54:01] <%livlinn> PrideRise PrideRise PrideRise
[2:54:02] <%czeekytv> @amonimis I don't launch anything using big picture, I play ffxiv and NieR just fine with a plug n play dualsense controller

[2:54:23] <olaksi> Not having a boar be a boss in the FF14 raid was a missed opportunity

[2:56:44] <%BigDumBeak> THIS GUY
[2:56:45] <%czeekytv> @amonimis Oh I have that too, apparently Automata didn't have ps4 icons at all, they had to be modded in lol. You would think a japanese-devved game would have sony symbols, but I guess it's a port of the xbox version? idk

[3:02:30] <SunnySideX> yooo they kept the yonah animation for the loading screen
[3:02:35] <yeeyeyee> So much of the things in Nier and Drakengard are specifically designed to make you feel bad to do them, on purpose, and to change that would be a betrayal of the work
[3:02:36] <%AyotoCorp> There's an auto-sprint setting in the options

[3:03:18] <%solracc25> NH Rise
[3:03:19] <%livlinn> D:
[3:03:20] <KaitlynnHere> Poor sheep
[3:03:20] <olm46> They were dispersed into atoms
[3:03:23] <Daniel_Is_I> @PatStaresAt They can despawn like the second they leave the camera
[3:03:26] <%13ry4n93> they despawned
[3:03:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I told you, they disappear if off screen quickly
[3:03:29] <+buffn99> It seems like they nerfed the drifting in the remake lol. Didn't seem to work as well to me
[3:03:31] <shieldecho> don't get attacked by anything or run into anything if you don't want to break shit
[3:03:32] <$RealThiele> MHR carve timer
[3:03:33] <%Mendin> I mean we saw that boar hit you
[3:03:35] <cardamomo88> decesad

[3:03:37] <dinnydanny777> this songs so good
[3:03:39] <yeeyeyee> it's a quick travel boar

[3:03:50] <majindusto> Boooo
[3:03:51] <%AyotoCorp> Do it coward
[3:03:53] <%ShinobiPhoenix> it's "easy" (if you plan for it)
[3:03:53] <yourliteraldog> do it pussy
[3:03:56] <%czeekytv> it's fine since you atuo sprint now
[3:03:58] <SulfurousAcid> it's almost impossible at this point in the game
[3:03:59] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt you said the same thing the first time you rode a boar
[3:04:00] <%Ranryu692> @patstaresat sometimes sheep corpses disappear when they go off screen
[3:04:02] <shieldecho> I forget but I don't think you can even JUMP if you don't want to break thing; dm
[3:04:03] <majindusto> COWARD
[3:04:03] <pixelkenj> the aerie is a combat section right now anyway
[3:04:04] <+glgzephyr> The livestock despawn as soon as you move the camera off of them @PatStaresAt
[3:04:04] <shieldecho> dpm
[3:04:05] <Daniel_Is_I> You gotta go to the chief's house anyway for the main quest
[3:04:07] <KaitlynnHere> Eat that bussie
[3:04:07] <+Vigonept> we love it
[3:04:10] <yourliteraldog> We like to see you suffer
[3:04:11] <shieldecho> don't quote me on that though
[3:04:11] <%muXPerience> Twitch chat is fresh out of gorms
[3:04:12] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt Do it later when there are no shades in the Aerie
[3:04:16] <+LionKagura> @shieldecho yes you can
[3:04:18] <%ringabal> PAT NO, That's peer pressure!
[3:04:20] <%solracc25> Boar used EXTREMESPEED! Supereffective
[3:04:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> just remember what actions are legal for the quests
[3:04:27] <majindusto> DON'T  BE A BABY
[3:04:32] <shieldecho> @shieldecho I thought I might've been wrong
[3:04:33] <+JustToWatch> you need to go their anyway. and it's easy not to get hit
[3:04:35] <+LionKagura> @shieldecho you can jump you just cant dodge/run
[3:04:35] <+PrimalDweeb> Nope
[3:04:38] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[3:04:40] <+DrGlendale> you have to dmc 1 jump dodge it. either a quick quest or the worst quest ever. i just did it 20 minutes ago
[3:04:41] <%BoxNavy> mutonn
[3:04:41] <cardamomo88> LUL
[3:04:44] <%NitronStreams> nier auto mutton
[3:04:46] <zenith0111> THIS IS THE TRUE NIER EXPERIENCE
[3:04:47] <%Bmrandfriends> wait for the goat hides
[3:04:50] <DeliveryPig> Nier: mutton
[3:04:55] <+Walopoh> Nier otto Mutton
[3:05:12] <%solracc25> must go extinct
[3:05:16] <%muXPerience> automutton
[3:05:23] <KaitlynnHere> Mut ton
[3:05:24] <amonimis> nier replicant wait to get more mutton
[3:05:25] <%solracc25> need all the sheep
[3:05:25] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @futurecity10 nah,it's super possible if you go into it knowing where to go and what actions are legal? I did it literally before stream
[3:05:26] <gslayer14> everytime i hear the shade hit noise it makes me think of that fucking pufferfish
[3:05:27] <Zourath> nier octo mutton
[3:05:27] <SunnySideX> that dash is sick
[3:05:28] <%Monkeyweed21> its pronounce Moo Ton
[3:05:29] <gslayer14> god damn it
[3:05:32] <brachydios777> That doge is so slick
[3:05:39] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt how likely combat
[3:05:42] <%muXPerience> was that a yakuza style dodge
[3:05:50] <+nabby1> Could  i just the sidequests in this?
[3:05:50] <+buffn99> @PatStaresAt likey*
[3:05:51] <pixelkenj> where do you get Bullfango Pelt+
[3:05:55] <zenith0111> They dont teach you anything substantial until the time jump
[3:05:56] <%Valdorick> Nuthin but Mutton to eat
[3:05:56] <%solracc25> Heartless killed
[3:05:58] <+glgzephyr> you're gonna need that wool later
[3:05:59] <olm46> Awww he's learning to ruin ecosystems
[3:06:01] <+nabby1> Skip'''
[3:06:15] <%ShinobiPhoenix> technically, the game has NOT taught me how to do the launcher that I've been doing since the beginning
[3:06:20] <%solracc25> Boar
[3:06:23] <%patriotrenegade> The sheep's death sound is used in Borderlands 3 and its really throwing me off
[3:06:33] <Frade> is Pat playing OG OSt or remix?
[3:06:34] <%Jeshk0> nothing worse than a sad tree...
[3:06:39] <SulfurousAcid> hey look a big empty space
[3:06:44] <ProfessorLitmus> ps4 data to start aplication is a lie. game just sits at the splash screen after you try to start it
[3:06:45] <majindusto> NOT BURGERS
[3:06:51] <Big_Dream> lol
[3:06:52] <%depotagents> ...(stressed)
[3:06:56] <iosephe> ayo
[3:06:58] <zenith0111> huh
[3:06:59] <neidhardt0> I don't think even automata teaches you how to launch
[3:06:59] <Daniel_Is_I> A building from WHERE though?
[3:07:03] <KaitlynnHere> Does your dog use his burgers to suck his own dong?
[3:07:03] <shieldecho> ...Huh.
[3:07:04] <Big_Dream> goreshadowing
[3:07:05] <brachydios777> When you think about it, Nier really is a darker version of Heartless and Nobodies
[3:07:06] <Dwarven_Gaming> i dont think its the same
[3:07:07] <dinnydanny777> It's a shrek shack
[3:07:07] <Big_Dream> foreshadowing
[3:07:07] <OkamiDude15> @ShinobiPhoenix whats the input for it?
[3:07:07] <%Valdorick> Oh right... this is where the mall is in Automata?
[3:07:09] <%patriotrenegade> shut up
[3:07:12] <zenith0111> Automata doesnt teach shit
[3:07:12] <cardamomo88> steal the flowers
[3:07:17] <SunnySideX> it's under a cave in Automata
[3:07:22] <%ringabal> But where does the elevator come from?
[3:07:27] <Dwarven_Gaming> the mall isnt here, i think emil just made ANOTHER house of kaines
[3:07:32] <+robosqueeb> time is convoluted in nier land
[3:07:34] <zenith0111> @sunnysidex That was under a city
[3:07:38] <olm46> A lot of the stuff was buried and rebuilt in Automata
[3:07:47] <shieldecho> I always thought a certain someone just moved it
[3:07:48] <dinnydanny777> it's blooming brilliant
[3:07:50] <rasamune> Me say no, me say please, me no hero, me so sorry

[3:08:57] <TonberryLives> They really went super hard on the redone music tracks eh?
[3:08:57] <%ShinobiPhoenix> launcher into Helmsplitter is a very safe "Fuck out of my face" move
[3:08:59] <%Valdorick> Imagine being the asshole who had to make the pillars for the platforms.
[3:09:05] <%Valdorick> All the way down to the ground level.
[3:09:12] <%ElkRiverDog> .....this is starting to feel like a ff14 New Zone flyover animation.......
[3:09:12] <Daniel_Is_I> Nevermind the fact that you needed to break boxes to beat the Lost Shrinew
[3:09:15] <shieldecho> bork

[3:12:23] <%PettyFunk> I’ve been playing this game for like 15 hours now, I owe you a big thank you for introducing me to it back in the SBFP days Pat
[3:12:30] <Sunstalker> So Silicon Valley? Kappa
[3:12:40] <%solracc25> c c c c counter!
[3:12:40] <cheapdoc> Do the citizens of the canyon know the big secret?
[3:12:40] <amonimis> BUM BUM BUM BUM
[3:12:42] <egoat> weiss should have a dialog slider like bubsy
[3:12:46] <egoat> in case you want more liam o'brian
[3:12:52] <Broken_Sonex> @Sunstalker Eyyyyyy
[3:12:58] <%PettyFunk> A smug slider
[3:13:01] <Byorski> Legit question, what are the voices when you absorb shade blood?
[3:13:01] <a_mad_dragon_> this muisc is a bit much...
[3:13:05] <olm46> Pods should have had auto lockon
[3:13:08] <trickster721> Classic situation where people build a house on a giant pillar and then complain about the insurance
[3:13:10] <%BoxNavy> yes
[3:13:11] <%Valdorick> The Pods seemed like an afterthought
[3:13:13] <zenith0111> Magic is op
[3:13:16] <AllenDeadman> agreed
[3:13:18] <shieldecho> Yeah the Pod programs never really wowed me
[3:13:22] <%AzureGale> Yeah but one of the pods is voiced by Wesker
[3:13:23] <Profmcstevie> Even in universe, magic is WAY better than pod
[3:13:23] <lemon_lover28> the pods were still fun
[3:13:24] <SolumFuturae> coloring books NotLikeThis
[3:13:27] <pixelkenj> ban reading
[3:13:29] <+DrGlendale> dang, he said it
[3:13:30] <brachydios777> Magic is canonicaly op as fuck in Automata
[3:13:32] <%solracc25> Pods > Book
[3:13:32] <Daniel_Is_I> Surprised you're not shooting all the time since you can shoot while you attack
[3:13:37] <%walternatorz> what if i want to sell weapons?
[3:13:41] <%ringabal> OH god I forgot about the books
[3:13:43] <dinnydanny777> Well it's magic
[3:13:45] <TonberryLives> The magic system was overhauled to be more useful in this version though
[3:13:45] <FirewallStorm> Magic>science
[3:13:46] <%PettyFunk> Pods were helpful but magic is practically required
[3:13:47] <shieldecho> ...I think you still might need them for crafting weapons; someone correct me, I'm probably wrong
[3:13:49] <Sunstalker> Schoolbooks are a fucking racket, designed to leech money out of kids
[3:13:50] <zenith0111> Weiss > Pod
[3:13:52] <%FallenAngelSC2> Why are these monsters carrying these interesting books and shit? Kappa
[3:13:52] <%walternatorz> but what if I really want to sell weapons?
[3:13:55] <%BoxNavy> sell one weapon, as a treat :)
[3:13:56] <$Futurecity10> just say that weapons unlock an item
[3:13:56] <%charp35> Please never sell weapons
[3:13:57] <SulfurousAcid> never stop selling weapons :)
[3:14:03] <zenith0111> NEVER SELL THE WEAPONS
[3:14:04] <LordOfThePoultry> NEVER seel weapons
[3:14:05] <+DrGlendale> were robot parts junk sellables in atomotuh?
[3:14:06] <cardamomo88> NVER
[3:14:06] <%Valdorick> SELL ALL WEAPONS, ESPEICALLY THE RARE ONES
[3:14:07] <%PettyFunk> I’ve been selling fish
[3:14:09] <wolfen091> sell all weapons
[3:14:13] <Tracazoid> Never, ever, ever sell weapons in a Drakenier game
[3:14:15] <%patriotrenegade> what about just one
[3:14:16] <%AzureGale> You will regret your words and deeds to sell weapons
[3:14:17] <pixelkenj> but i always sell my old weapons in JRPGs
[3:14:17] <AllenDeadman> BIG regret
[3:14:17] <olm46> But what if I'm a merchant NPC in the actual game. Should I sell them to Nier?
[3:14:19] <%patriotrenegade> can i sell just one?
[3:14:20] <Vertigheist> sell all of them for reward
[3:14:25] <%13ry4n93> here's the guide to selling weapons: don't
[3:14:25] <Slimeking_Mike> What, didn't you love it in Automata how the Pods only ever did the beam attack in cutscenes instead of any of the other cool abilities they could theoretically do
[3:14:27] <dinnydanny777> But what if I want money :)
[3:14:29] <trickster721> What is that creepy voice that keeps mumbling something?
[3:14:31] <%ShinobiPhoenix> so if anyone wants to know, my trick for doing the Aerie quest out of the way early. kill the Shades carefully with smooth ground attack and BLOCK A LOT, AND ABUSE Dark Blast. especially the last part. for defense
[3:14:33] <amonimis> what are they gonna do, delete my save?
[3:14:33] <%PettyFunk> After finishing the fish side quest it’s pretty easy to catch expensive fishies
[3:14:37] <%FallenAngelSC2> Real NieRmen sell all their shit when they grow out of it
[3:14:37] <Vertigheist> @pixelkenj yeah it's kinda funny right
[3:14:41] <+darkpulse703> Directions unclear, kitchen knife sold
[3:14:42] <+PrimalDweeb> Noice
[3:14:44] <shieldecho> @patriotrenegade The game will remember that
[3:14:48] <+DrGlendale> is the wavy bitch dagger obtainable later? cuz i hecka missed that
[3:14:48] <cheapdoc> Magic is so much stronger
[3:14:49] <+tetraes> well if you want to see all the endings you better not lol
[3:14:51] <SolumFuturae> what about selling the DLC weapon
[3:14:53] <%Valdorick> oh right, the Word system
[3:14:56] <zenith0111> @slimeking_mike That was weird to me too
[3:15:01] <%Valdorick> The bitch Chip system.
[3:15:05] <dinnydanny777> I mean, do I really need an iron pipe?
[3:15:05] <%13ry4n93> he's got a shield for all the good it did him
[3:15:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> Also funnel shades on to bridges instead of in places they can surround you
[3:15:11] <+Walopoh> monkaS
[3:15:14] <zenith0111> I forgot the word system lmao
[3:15:18] <olm46> That's... concerning
[3:15:20] <%PettyFunk> Yeah, while magic>pods, chips>>words
[3:15:24] <+Linconlord> he's getting the vaccine monkaS
[3:15:26] <Clanes> So, looks like Spear magic is really good
[3:15:28] <+darkpulse703> monkaW Maybe we're the badies
[3:15:29] <%13ry4n93> what is that mom doing
[3:15:37] <+DrGlendale> dude the iron pipe cameo in atomoton was kinda dope
[3:15:41] <%AzureGale> How many tutorials does this game have
[3:15:42] <pixelkenj> did you know you can pick up items :)
[3:15:43] <zenith0111> All magic is a screen clear
[3:15:51] <SulfurousAcid> maybe
[3:15:52] <pixelkenj> it loops yeah
[3:15:53] <+GigaSeifer> not nothing, LOOT
[3:15:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yes
[3:15:54] <stevenellis386> so are the shades actually people once?
[3:15:56] <Broken_Sonex> @13ry4n93 Oh you know just beating her kid
[3:15:56] <%justacrow84> @clanes Spear was the only spell you ever needed in the original
[3:15:56] <yourliteraldog> You got some seed
[3:15:58] <+PrimalDweeb> Jump down, there's a latter near the beggining.
[3:16:02] <%BoxNavy> fuck this place
[3:16:03] <%ShinobiPhoenix> go back down to near the beginning
[3:16:03] <%Valdorick> No Pat, you learned about how to collect Materials.
[3:16:03] <pixelkenj> look for a ladder
[3:16:04] <+Halfsock> everyone i was watching today got so confused here
[3:16:06] <zenith0111> Did Pat get sucked into the farm yet?
[3:16:08] <%patriotrenegade> hell yeah borther
[3:16:21] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I missed it the first time while running from Shades
[3:16:22] <%13ry4n93> @Broken_Sonex oh well, in that case carry on
[3:16:29] <+PrimalDweeb> Yep
[3:16:33] <majindusto> BOM, BOM,BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM
[3:16:33] <%ShinobiPhoenix> that ladder
[3:16:38] <dinnydanny777> how the hell did they build this place
[3:16:39] <%PettyFunk> @stevenellis386 The answer to that is kinda complicated. But the voices you’re currently hearing are the people inside their houses
[3:16:42] <cheapdoc> I'm still in a dream
[3:16:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> yep, exactly. I did it too
[3:16:43] <zenith0111> The big red X?
[3:16:47] <%13ry4n93> paaaaat
[3:16:48] <+darkpulse703> LUL
[3:16:48] <%walternatorz> is that how he normally climbs the ladder or is pat being fucky with it?
[3:16:49] <teefpal> what a thrill
[3:16:49] <Clanes> @justacrow84 I meant to say "Still" in there. Just because I know I heard there was some minor rebalancing done
[3:16:50] <yourliteraldog> Your Kind?
[3:16:52] <+PrimalDweeb> I had to figure that out while high.
[3:16:53] <%TimetodiveLTX> ballz
[3:16:58] <LorcaNomad> I mean the ladders blend in really well, no worries
[3:16:58] <Broken_Sonex> GET OUTTA HERE WITH YOUR BLACK EVIL MAGIC
[3:17:00] <brachydios777> There’s a black spear and a white spear that reference the Niers in Automata, right?
[3:17:04] <%13ry4n93> they don't trust twinks around here
[3:17:06] <%ShinobiPhoenix> being chased, I super missed the ladder
[3:17:07] <Vertigheist> they don't trust pretty bishies boys? understandable
[3:17:07] <yourliteraldog> He is white as bleached snow
[3:17:08] <teefpal> mag
[3:17:09] <cheapdoc> We don't trust bishounen in this village
[3:17:10] <%Valdorick> Drop Rate go up
[3:17:19] <olm46> @yourliteraldog shotas
[3:17:22] <%13ry4n93> specially not the sword wielding king
[3:17:25] <karl_rex> Why do the shades drop school books?
[3:17:25] <%13ry4n93> kind
[3:17:28] <dinnydanny777> I feel like, many people have fallen off this village
[3:17:30] <%ShinobiPhoenix> same
[3:17:33] <amonimis> dang gaijin
[3:17:36] <penitentpendant> The most powerful of stats: Drop Rate
[3:17:37] <zenith0111> @brachydios777 4 dlc weapons that are free
[3:17:40] <olaksi> we gonna have some words
[3:17:41] <%AzureGale> Always go for magic find %+
[3:17:42] <%PettyFunk> “We don’t trust your kind! We prefer the craggy old baritone man!”
[3:17:53] <iosephe> Sick
[3:17:59] <Sunstalker> If disco elysium taught us anything, it's that offering the shades speed might get them to trust us
[3:17:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I only just learned you can use the same words for multiple items
[3:18:00] <SolumFuturae> Wait, were the shades calling out those words? Were they crying "pah" and "mah" when you killed them?
[3:18:06] <teefpal> Murderhobos
[3:18:11] <%Garthunox> Iiiiiits guh
[3:18:12] <zenith0111> Even the normal fireball attack is super strong
[3:18:15] <%Valdorick> Yeah, they both have penises
[3:18:17] <dinnydanny777> All of them? limesD
[3:18:20] <%solracc25> stomp them kids, I mean shades
[3:18:25] <teefpal> Wait the shades talk?
[3:18:30] <%ringabal> "He's too hot and androgynous to be kept alive!"
[3:18:31] <%AzureGale> How do you know that
[3:18:34] <%PettyFunk> @solumfuturae I think the shades only speak gibberish until a later route
[3:18:35] <+darkpulse703> D:
[3:18:38] <a_mad_dragon_> not yet they don't
[3:18:38] <AllenDeadman> could we please kill everybody in this village?
[3:18:39] <shieldecho> I mean, being compared to Kaine seems like the biggest compliment one can receive, so..
[3:18:39] <Vertigheist> @Valdorick LUL
[3:18:42] <dinnydanny777> How you doing Chief?
[3:18:46] <cardamomo88> FUCK YOU

[3:18:58] <%AzureGale> F
[3:19:01] <%cvp5127> youre doordash is here
[3:19:03] <Tonuha> the music here feels less dramatic
[3:19:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if you bring the "egg" with you, you can take care of both things and not need to be come back
[3:19:12] <+ApocalypticExpress> No this is Byleth as Nier
[3:19:16] <pixelkenj> I had to reload several times to get it past those shades in one piece
[3:19:18] <%FallenAngelSC2> Little does Weiss know...
[3:19:19] <SolumFuturae> @PettyFunk I know, I just wanted to imply they were calling out for their parents
[3:19:20] <%solracc25> broken AF

[3:19:58] <+rbakervv> @Deft_Thought without getting hit, dodging, or falling to far
[3:19:58] <amonimis> wait isnt there a sidequet involves delivering something without it breaking aka not getting hit once on the way?
[3:19:58] <+DrGlendale> @deft_thought getting hit and no rolling

[3:23:12] <%neroforte177> the BURGERS
[3:23:17] <%Ranryu692> @Bmrandfriends to force other people to view her as a woman
[3:23:19] <radioamnesiac> @yourliteraldog her butt does have a tiny corset. an asset, even
[3:23:21] <%Agami23> im kinda surprised hook wasent in the nier raid

[3:23:27] <%livlinn> Hekk
[3:23:27] <dinnydanny777> That back part is incredibly horrible
[3:23:33] <%FallenAngelSC2> WTF WAS THAT SHOT KAINE
[3:23:33] <%Ranryu692> same
[3:23:42] <KoryMccool> is it me or does the music sound off for pat? Also what verison is this
[3:23:48] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt did you finish the game?
[3:23:50] <$RealThiele> laura bailey is multi-talented
[3:23:52] <Overhaul180> Knowing the context of those orbs is kind of messed up now
[3:23:54] <dinnydanny777> She's got A Call Beyond holy shit limesD
[3:23:55] <zenith0111> @agami23 Too spoilery
[3:23:56] <CurrySauseBandit> Understandable. Her magic effects we're near translucent
[3:23:59] <Kenyuki4> That because her companion AI sucks man
[3:24:05] <radioamnesiac> @Bmrandfriends it's also to accentuate the parts of her that are 100% her
[3:24:06] <%BoxNavy> doe jermaSun
[3:24:06] <Broken_Sonex> @Bmrandfriends It's better this way
[3:24:07] <%Agami23> her magic is also weirdly unique as its not the red of dragon magic
[3:24:10] <Estwilde> Oh, hello Liam O'Brien book
[3:24:12] <majindusto> JUMP YOU FOOL
[3:24:13] <%AzureGale> Kaine channeling her inner Reaper
[3:24:17] <+traximus_s> there's the line
[3:24:18] <SulfurousAcid> drop the F bomb Kaine
[3:24:19] <+marlborored5> @PatStaresAt you think you're gonna be able to play as her in this remake?
[3:24:21] <+DrGlendale> Is Kaine a Vergil?
[3:24:22] <yourliteraldog> What that mouth do
[3:24:25] <%PettyFunk> “I didn’t think shades could get that big!” There’s an Elton John joke here
[3:24:26] <%13ry4n93> it's kinda weird how unhype this fight is
[3:24:41] <VidulaSaix> Jesus I'm glad I didn't do normal. Stuff dies way too fast
[3:24:43] <cardamomo88> is juste me or this sound kinda meh
[3:24:44] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[3:24:45] <%cvp5127> @DrGlendale no
[3:24:45] <%solracc25> NieR Souls?
[3:24:56] <%BoxNavy> ow i guess
[3:24:57] <+NotaryRotary> LUL
[3:24:59] <+PrimalDweeb> LUL
[3:25:00] <olm46> The most inefficient save
[3:25:01] <Sol_Install> never
[3:25:02] <%Deft_Thought> Nah
[3:25:03] <+ChaosAethr> nope
[3:25:03] <neidhardt0> yea normal is pretty easy
[3:25:03] <rasamune> There was not
[3:25:04] <%BoxNavy> there was no time
[3:25:05] <AllenDeadman> LUL
[3:25:07] <%Deft_Thought> She needed to kick you
[3:25:07] <zenith0111> LUL
[3:25:08] <blackbaron98> face kick
[3:25:09] <cheapdoc> No better, only kick
[3:25:09] <Tonuha> Fun fact @PatStaresAt my first time watching through this whole game was your playthrough
[3:25:09] <%Valdorick> There was not, no.
[3:25:10] <DarkestDom> LUL
[3:25:11] <xinexes> NO
[3:25:12] <Nelsukako> no it has to be this way
[3:25:12] <+TheBitingIrish> Oh god, it reminds me of the titty monster from RE6 DansGame
[3:25:13] <Slimeking_Mike> Naw, she had to flex on you
[3:25:15] <radioamnesiac> get down mr president!!
[3:25:17] <%AzureGale> DED
[3:25:19] <Nelsukako> it is the only way
[3:25:25] <fireadept> she had to pause and position herself to kick you, that was on purpose
[3:25:27] <Owkono> I'd take that kick any day
[3:25:27] <%baka_sugoi> B A L L
[3:25:28] <%solracc25> unnecessary
[3:25:29] <%AzureGale> SPIRIT BOMB
[3:25:31] <%13ry4n93> that was weird sound to make
[3:25:32] <$RealThiele> ORB
[3:25:32] <valhallandoates> what a squelch
[3:25:33] <neidhardt0> ew that sound
[3:25:35] <lemon_lover28> why were both those attacks so slow?
[3:25:39] <%Mr_Pylon> that orb was very wet
[3:25:39] <%13ry4n93> just so slimy
[3:25:40] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> This is... Nonsense
[3:25:42] <%depotagents> I feel like a lot of the violence in nier is.. like, the impact never feels right.
[3:25:44] <SlimeSlimeSlime> he scrawlin' yo
[3:25:45] <rasamune> It's gross
[3:25:47] <olaksi> i remembered this fight having way more banter
[3:25:51] <%Deft_Thought> What a freakazoid
[3:25:52] <valhallandoates> styled on by a girl in a nightgown
[3:25:59] <CurrySauseBandit> Hard is honestly much better for the narrative. Breakpoints and ho on normal sets no tension or just has dialogue get skipped. .-.
[3:26:04] <%baka_sugoi> HU MAN
[3:26:10] <+ChaosAethr> Love the Kaine from FF4 is the Book
[3:26:10] <%13ry4n93> nobody here is human Nier
[3:26:12] <dinnydanny777> Oh, it's tail is actually a chunky leg limesO
[3:26:14] <Vertigheist> if poopa nier was here, he'd be the first character who wears pants
[3:26:21] <%solracc25> clothes woman
[3:26:25] <CurrySauseBandit> kek "human"
[3:26:25] <Nelsukako> it is fine she kick you
[3:26:25] <Sol_Install> DARK HAND
[3:26:26] <cardamomo88> papa nier will kill her
[3:26:31] <UTaken34> KAINEEEEE
[3:26:32] <Sol_Install> time to jojo
[3:26:34] <+zuzuxiv> THE MUSIC
[3:26:38] <+PrimalDweeb> Love this song!
[3:26:38] <neidhardt0> I can't wait to hear that line
[3:26:52] <2DSuperiority> ding ding ding ding
[3:26:55] <pixelkenj> no one cares this book talks
[3:26:58] <zenith0111> Yoko Taro did say he wanted the game to be easy enough for anyone to beat it on Normal
[3:26:58] <SulfurousAcid> the theme alychaGasm
[3:26:58] <fatcrab> I loved the original nier i should get this remake too
[3:27:00] <AllenDeadman> the music

[3:27:07] <%The_HeroOfCanton> The_HeroOfCanton subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
[3:27:08] <Vertigheist> I can't unsee weiss as a redditor
[3:27:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> BTW, does the game have level scaling?
[3:27:11] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[3:27:18] <%13ry4n93> @pixelkenj she just fight a giant shadow lizard
[3:27:21] <SulfurousAcid> this is my fav track in the game
[3:27:23] <olm46> Don't like pegging? Steer clear.
[3:27:23] <shieldecho> Oh hey, this music. TIME TO CRY AGAIN.
[3:27:24] <fireadept> i imagine that scene will specifically have papa nier's voice
[3:27:28] <radioamnesiac> kaine: get out of my house. weiss: how. fucking. dare you.
[3:27:29] <%13ry4n93> oh god, this song!
[3:27:33] <zenith0111> Iconic Theme
[3:27:36] <Broken_Sonex> Suck her dick, it's the only way.
[3:27:37] <CurrySauseBandit> @shinobiphoenix iirc no.
[3:27:38] <%NitronStreams> THE SOOOOOONG
[3:27:41] <%depotagents> Kaine....
[3:27:43] <%Aeogard> i rreally think the original of this is a bit better ;--;
[3:27:44] <%baka_sugoi> half naked pretty lady
[3:27:44] <Sol_Install> fuck this theme KICKS ASS
[3:27:45] <+Walopoh> the song from last podcast LUL
[3:27:47] <ConflagrationsGaming> The song.
[3:27:54] <+ChaosAethr> NieR No Strange
[3:27:55] <%justacrow84> And on that day Shota Nier had discovered his fetish.
[3:27:55] <yourliteraldog> Good Taste Neir
[3:28:05] <Broken_Sonex> @Aeogard Yeah, now you're just trolling
[3:28:09] <$RealThiele> its that iconic FF14 song
[3:28:10] <Vertigheist> don't suck her dick yet, it's not legal
[3:28:11] <%BoxNavy> popadopala lionDongers
[3:28:13] <%kujofire990> this song is a nice remix of the one for 14
[3:28:16] <%livlinn> joofbBop
[3:28:19] <+buffn99> How did they just get the music so right in nier
[3:28:21] <lemon_lover28> does that choice actually effect anything?
[3:28:23] <fatcrab> D:
[3:28:24] <%ShinobiPhoenix> see, what the fuck? the boar is there for Pat
[3:28:27] <%solracc25> aww
[3:28:28] <egoat> why bully sheep
[3:28:30] <%Aeogard> @Broken_Sonex I used my headphones, it's a different track man lmao
[3:28:31] <%solracc25> the music
[3:28:36] <%Monkeyweed21> more like DOPOLA
[3:28:37] <yourliteraldog> Technically their are no goverments theirfore no laws
[3:28:39] <ScreamLord> Kill the children Pat
[3:28:43] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> Is every song in this shitty church choir but this
[3:28:44] <zenith0111> Because Square Enix has an entire Orchestra at their disposal
[3:28:49] <%solracc25> 2KO
[3:28:50] <%ShinobiPhoenix> when I did this a few hours ago, the boar was walking around with hitboxes
[3:28:53] <neidhardt0> Yea I still don't get the music complaints.
[3:28:53] <+Walopoh> fuck that sheep
[3:28:59] <cardamomo88> LUL have to kill all
[3:29:00] <penitentpendant> Magic really SEALS IN THE FLAVOR
[3:29:01] <@Pandora_Prime> SSS-Rank ost
[3:29:04] <%Ranryu692> you can R1 them
[3:29:09] <feralspidey> at least it died quick
[3:29:09] <+warlockwithapixie> !uptime
[3:29:09] <@Moobot> @warlockwithapixie I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 29m.
[3:29:12] <%ShinobiPhoenix> pat does it, the boar is laying by the exit sleeping
[3:29:14] <%PettyFunk> @raven_in_a_tree Have you not heard Song of the Ancients?
[3:29:15] <trickster721> It had one mutton inside, the rest is useless
[3:29:15] <Broken_Sonex> @Aeogard I got headphones too. This OST is great
[3:29:16] <Melchior_the_Wise> music is S tier
[3:29:16] <%BoxNavy> new thing bad old thing good
[3:29:18] <+darkpulse703> The music is Fantastic
[3:29:20] <+killer_squid1990> it's different so people automatically get mad
[3:29:21] <+buffn99> @Aeogard Yeah there's more instruments
[3:29:22] <mortificent> wait there's music complaints???
[3:29:22] <%13ry4n93> the aerie theme was kinda weird
[3:29:25] <SolumFuturae> what could there even be to complain about?
[3:29:30] <karl_rex> People don't like the music?!
[3:29:30] <gslayer14> atm it's fine but there was echo issues earlier
[3:29:30] <Vertigheist> its mostly nostalgia ear phones
[3:29:32] <zenith0111> People would complain either way
[3:29:35] <LorcaNomad> Literally why are people complaining the music is so fucking good
[3:29:38] <gslayer14> might've just been one track
[3:29:40] <KingVantq> "Its not the original so its bad" reddit people
[3:29:41] <%Aeogard> @Broken_Sonex I never said it was bad though, I just prefer the originals LUL
[3:29:43] <srcalavera94> brother nier is such a bich boy.
[3:29:48] <KoryMccool> is pat plauing to pc or ps4 version
[3:29:48] <majindusto> People  are Babies regarding  any changes
[3:29:50] <%psydaku> is the block button as op as before?
[3:29:52] <%muXPerience> it feels in line stylistically
[3:29:53] <%PettyFunk> @13ry4n93 I mean the Aerie itself is kinda weird
[3:29:55] <+Walopoh> Remember: anything being different means people think it's automatically worse
[3:29:55] <blue8moon> it's different, and as everyone knows, different = bad
[3:29:56] <LycheeMusings> Is he gonna blast through to the timeskip in one sesh?
[3:29:58] <The_Legendairy> I still prefer the old tracks of the ones I've heard
[3:29:58] <zenith0111> Music is slighty remixed but theyre still essentially the same tracks so its nitpicky at best
[3:29:58] <%13ry4n93> god, why do you keep murdering the sheepy's pat
[3:29:58] <%ElkRiverDog> Purists gonna sulk and putrefy
[3:29:58] <Broken_Sonex> No one should be complaining
[3:30:00] <%solracc25> Need Big Word For Big Bool
[3:30:04] <GeltonZ> Don't forget there's a few songs that are different between Gestalt and Replicant
[3:30:05] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> @pettyfunk no but i hate choir music as someone that was in one
[3:30:07] <%Axellogic> The problem is that some tracks are slightly worse and its like "why even change it"
[3:30:09] <pixelkenj> well too bad
[3:30:11] <Finakala> Eh, I'll just buy the Replicant OST to go alongside the OG one I have
[3:30:11] <amonimis> my only complaint so far is brother nier's shota pants LUL
[3:30:13] <%GarbageNirvana> I do believe that was the idea, yes/
[3:30:13] <+BurkeBigsby> What's wrong with having choice to use old music? Have both as options?
[3:30:13] <+killer_squid1990> the combat being good LUL
[3:30:14] <olm46> Some tracks don't sound as good to me. They're still great by any sane metric.
[3:30:18] <Broken_Sonex> @Aeogard Purist.
[3:30:20] <+TenguGemini> how different is the combat from the original version?
[3:30:22] <+killer_squid1990> it's so much better now
[3:30:24] <shieldecho> Only music complaint I understand is the one Clemps pointed out: After hours and hours of the same tracks they can get kind of tedious
[3:30:24] <LunarRemix> You think it's going to pull a FF7R later on?
[3:30:25] <penitentpendant> "An improvement? REEE!" ~Some Purist
[3:30:30] <+Dumb_Parrot> It's very simple. Different instrumentation and orchestra, so some people are gonna prefer the original ones and others the new ones. It's just a taste thing.
[3:30:31] <dinnydanny777> No but the combat should feel bad so that you feel bad Kappa
[3:30:34] <softbirby> do you think they'll remake gestalt if this does well?
[3:30:41] <Vertigheist> time skip bronier is an improvement designs wise at least
[3:30:42] <%ShinobiPhoenix> noooo, I Hate the combat is good now! - someone somewhere
[3:30:44] <Melchior_the_Wise> some songs are better, some are worse, some are just different.
[3:30:47] <zenith0111> Combat is very different from OG
[3:30:50] <%PettyFunk> The combat is real smooth but I do miss the two-weapon combo strings in Automata
[3:30:52] <+Halfsock> papa neir didn't do those flips and spins right?
[3:30:54] <SolumFuturae> @Finakala isn't there like 3 versions of the Original's OST?
[3:30:57] <%GarbageNirvana> Looks like it's slightly better than Automata's combat
[3:30:58] <%13ry4n93> @softbirby they might release it as dlc
[3:30:59] <egoat> why is it spelled like that tho
[3:30:59] <KoryMccool> the combat in the original was quite stifff
[3:31:00] <egoat> NieR
[3:31:04] <GeltonZ> @ShinobiPhoenix That would be me, kinda XD I miss Air Rolling.
[3:31:06] <LoneFonte> Watch papa nier be NG+ or something
[3:31:08] <+PrimalDweeb> Personally, I want to kiss all up and down those milky legs. But maybe that's just me. LUL
[3:31:09] <%psydaku> so no block button?
[3:31:11] <+mgskomododragon> Wheres Dad Bod?
[3:31:13] <blue8moon> there's not enough differences between the versions to remake gestalt as an entirely separate game
[3:31:14] <cheapdoc> gestalt and replicant are the same game with a different looking main character, there is no need to make another one
[3:31:14] <%TimetodiveLTX> Pat Tries It
[3:31:14] <zenith0111> @korymccool Spear combo was busted af
[3:31:16] <penitentpendant> @PettyFunk I'm glad combat hacking is not in this game though
[3:31:18] <pixelkenj> much easier now that the shades are gone
[3:31:18] <%ringabal> Godspeed, orb man
[3:31:18] <cheapdoc> you just need a skin
[3:31:19] <amonimis> isn't there a weapon switch button now?
[3:31:24] <+TenguGemini> I want them to do this for drakengard so I can play that and experience being devoured by giant evil babies
[3:31:30] <%muXPerience> primaldweeb lives up to the name
[3:31:31] <Vertigheist> @PrimalDweeb like kid nier's?
[3:31:32] <%ShinobiPhoenix> ride boar to aerie
[3:31:34] <+killer_squid1990> @pettyfunk you can swap weapons mid combo but it's a bit janky
[3:31:34] <dmtjinni> Air fryer go vroom
[3:31:36] <pixelkenj> you can take the boar
[3:31:38] <%Valdorick> The OP Spear?
[3:31:40] <+itsgundamu> @GarbageNirvana meh i wouldn't say better than Automata, magic is fun but the overall combat feel and the amount of movesets you get in Automata is better
[3:31:43] <%PettyFunk> @penitentpendant Haha, I didn’t mind it but I understand the divisiveness
[3:31:44] <KoryMccool> you can ride the boar to the aerie
[3:31:46] <zentzen> its still broken
[3:31:47] <fairore> @PrimalDweeb WutFace
[3:31:51] <LycheeMusings> Wait is there no more air rolling?
[3:31:53] <+PrimalDweeb> @muXPerience LUL
[3:31:54] <Melchior_the_Wise> How long has it been since you played Nier Gestalt @PatStaresAt ?
[3:31:55] <%Valdorick> High damage, movement for free
[3:31:58] <Finakala> @SolumFuturae I think there's slight differences between Gestalt and Replicant maybe? Plus there's a remix album too
[3:32:00] <LorcaNomad> fucking LUL
[3:32:00] <fatcrab> I remember the spear strong-attack rolling shit that made you zoom so fast
[3:32:03] <zenith0111> Delete Half their health in one attack
[3:32:08] <GeltonZ> @LycheeMusings He has a proper air dash now
[3:32:15] <CurrySauseBandit> Too be fair, Pheonix WAS FUCKED but most weapons near it's tier are broken.
[3:32:17] <majindusto> I'm  so glad they fixed young nier's stupid long ridiculous spiky hair that he originally  had
[3:32:17] <%ShinobiPhoenix> boat is fine if you don't accelerate

[3:32:45] <+ChaosAethr> @PatStaresAt so Buy/ Wait / Skip?
[3:32:45] <%PettyFunk> @patstaresat Speaking of Phoenix Spear, I think they updated the spawn rate of the eagle egg. I’ve had five spawn in a row.
[3:32:46] <%solracc25> dank
[3:32:46] <zenith0111> @currysausebandit But spear had a multi hitting finishing blow that did a shit ton of damage
[3:32:47] <+JustToWatch> I think it was 5 years ago
[3:32:49] <Melchior_the_Wise> oh, 5 years, not as long as I thought.
[3:32:49] <teefpal> bum bum bum
[3:32:51] <radioamnesiac> ???! they changed his birthday?
[3:32:52] <+darkpulse703> The west got Conan the Barbarian Nier and Japan got Twink Nier LUL

[3:32:56] <+SilverDevilfish> That's Nanakoesque
[3:32:57] <+yoshkosh20> some people will take any excuse to party

[3:33:01] <%Maids4lyfe> Sep. 1 2016
[3:33:02] <dinnydanny777> Why does the game want to cause sadness limesFeels
[3:33:05] <%ShinobiPhoenix> wow... there are bats now?!
[3:33:08] <$RealThiele> BIG CHEATS
[3:33:16] <%walternatorz> I find that hard to believe
[3:33:18] <+JustToWatch> that's right Pat
[3:33:19] <%miguelrod777> pretty sneaky sis

[3:33:25] <+azraith> Man they made this game big pretty
[3:33:26] <%BoxNavy> is the eagle egg a missable?
[3:33:26] <%rumtumtugnutz> Your daughter is a bro on
[3:33:27] <zenith0111> TIME FOR EGGS
[3:33:29] <majindusto> Nah
[3:33:29] <a_mad_dragon_> SAVESCUMMING
[3:33:31] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The music for this town is so fucking evil
[3:33:35] <Melchior_the_Wise> Music Going too hard
[3:33:38] <Finakala> Pretty sure those bats were always there
[3:33:40] <mortificent> Now back to the wall
[3:33:41] <zenith0111> @boxnavy No just really rare
[3:33:45] <egoat> the construction of this whole village is like deeply nonsense
[3:33:48] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I don't have to come back because I did the quest on the first trip, so I never got bats
[3:33:49] <+Catpurnicus> Boss theme: The Town
[3:33:53] <penitentpendant> Good ole Hikkimori Village
[3:33:57] <shieldecho> And go where
[3:33:58] <%ringabal> Is this the internet village or something?
[3:33:59] <%solracc25> *breaks
[3:34:01] <pixelkenj> below the mayors house
[3:34:01] <CurrySauseBandit> @zenith0111 Not saying it didn't. I'm saying that the other best in slot weapons also hit like trucks that made the game a joke. Pheonix just more so than everything.
[3:34:01] <SolumFuturae> @Melchior_the_Wise no such thing
[3:34:02] <%Maids4lyfe> Yharnham's done for!
[3:34:05] <%BoxNavy> @zenith0111 ty ty :)
[3:34:07] <dinnydanny777> I wouldn't brave these walkways to leave ngl
[3:34:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @ScreamLord the song name is Steel Coffins
[3:34:13] <TonberryLives> Cold Steel Coffin
[3:34:13] <%FallenAngelSC2> @PatStaresAt 1 Sep 2016 was the end of Lucky Ted's adventure
[3:34:15] <+Raven_In_A_Tree> I have to mute the ost if iplay this choir gives me a headache
[3:34:18] <tattleworm> it's by that barrel to your right
[3:34:18] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Really embracing the Imperial design philosophy of no guard-rails.
[3:34:20] <tattleworm> i remember it well
[3:34:22] <HoneyComb14> its below you
[3:34:25] <%PettyFunk> It’s right under the chief
[3:34:27] <+darkpulse703> Still rude LUL
[3:34:29] <%ShinobiPhoenix> break the egg now
[3:34:30] <pixelkenj> This spot right here
[3:34:34] <LunarRemix> A lot less awkward post Covid
[3:34:34] <%solracc25> mail
[3:34:35] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> social distancing nier
[3:34:35] <+ApocalypticExpress> 5 YEARS AGO ALMOST
[3:34:37] <dinnydanny777> If I lived in this precarious floating village I wouldn't leave either out of fear of falling
[3:34:37] <%ShinobiPhoenix> in front of him
[3:34:38] <+Qexec> No contact delivery
[3:34:38] <%ringabal> "Sir, I've brought your Manscaped Kit."
[3:34:38] <HoneyComb14> damn
[3:34:39] <+TenguGemini> No fall damage, water kills you
[3:34:41] <pixelkenj> That glowing spot, but its RNG
[3:34:41] <%Mendin> My thoughts on the music debate: The new mixes sound more vibrant, but some of the area themes sound more fitting when gloomier/older
[3:34:43] <The_Legendairy> it's a rare spawn
[3:34:46] <%Ranryu692> right where you just picked that item up will sometimes spawn the egg
[3:34:50] <a_mad_dragon_> yeah just forge his signature
[3:34:50] <DeathByPoke7> contactless delivery
[3:34:54] <%ShinobiPhoenix> death of your own enemies?
[3:34:55] <+darkpulse703> heartless village
[3:35:01] <%PettyFunk> That was the spawn point though
[3:35:05] <%solracc25> covid rules leave it on the door
[3:35:06] <penitentpendant> @TenguGemini To be fair, you're built different from normal people
[3:35:06] <AllenDeadman> seriously fuck this village
[3:35:08] <amonimis> more like nobody village
[3:35:11] <zenith0111> Nier tip #2 always pick up shinies
[3:35:11] <Gunnehsan> that's the fastest you can get with ladders?
[3:35:13] <+TheBitingIrish> Such an inefficient way to climb ladders
[3:35:14] <%Ranryu692> you can also get it in the 3rd challenge nightmare thing later
[3:35:16] <+darkpulse703> yeah, it's amazing
[3:35:19] <pixelkenj> If you dont get the egg you can just jump off the bridge until you game over and respawn right by the mayor's house
[3:35:23] <+PrimalDweeb> It does
[3:35:24] <%cvp5127> it is tho
[3:35:24] <cheapdoc> 2020 made a village
[3:35:28] <zenith0111> It is
[3:35:31] <dinnydanny777> It looks like it
[3:35:33] <%walternatorz> they sure know how to build bridges
[3:35:38] <%TimetodiveLTX> ulillillia was afraid of water for a pretty long time because video game characters instantly die in it
[3:35:38] <Ranger747> opposite of Seafront
[3:35:46] <shieldecho> This track is great but it makes me kind of anxious after a few minutes.
[3:35:48] <ScreamLord> Forget the Shades. All this town needs to be obliterated is a bad storm or Earth Quake
[3:35:51] <%ShinobiPhoenix> people who can't get food since they are trapped in their metal cages
[3:35:52] <%BoxNavy> the bat wing monkaS
[3:35:52] <%justacrow84> a less charming Yharnam
[3:35:57] <%PettyFunk> Dang did I just have crazy luck? I’ve had an eagle egg spawn literally every time I hopped back into the village.
[3:36:01] <%Monkeyweed21> If they dont live here then who will bully and ostracize Kaine @PatStaresAt ?
[3:36:02] <kinkade_77> isnt this game about robots
[3:36:10] <%walternatorz> careful handling dead bats
[3:36:13] <majindusto> I RON
[3:36:17] <zenith0111> This zone is a boss fight thats why thr music is so intense lol
[3:36:18] <%solracc25> zubtats
[3:36:19] <%Aeogard> >robots LUL
[3:36:19] <srcalavera94> no but actually yes

[3:36:23] <%PettyFunk> @walternatorz oh no
[3:36:24] <+seiyaofabyss> Kanye?
[3:36:32] <cardamomo88> kanye
[3:36:34] <%superc37> herself?
[3:36:34] <pixelkenj> No wonder the Aerie people are weird, they have this BGM playing all day
[3:36:37] <amonimis> kaine
[3:36:40] <Slimeking_Mike> @kinkade_77 this is such a funny thing to ask
[3:36:41] <%FallenAngelSC2> I'll ostrich size Kaine Kappa
[3:36:46] <+TenguGemini> kaine is an experience
[3:36:47] <LycheeMusings> Kanye Salvation
[3:36:56] <%walternatorz> are you yelling at sheep?
[3:36:56] <%Maids4lyfe> Kaine
[3:36:56] <+mikesapartment> grr i'm steaming mad
[3:36:57] <+seiyaofabyss> forgot my kappa next to kanye lol
[3:36:58] <%zuzuxiv> am I crazy for not remembering the 'bum bum bum' part of that song
[3:36:59] <%PettyFunk> “Who will bully and ostracize Kaine” WEISS, CONSTANTLY
[3:37:00] <+PrimalDweeb> Dog has melted, confirmed.
[3:37:00] <pixelkenj> Nier Has to kill all the mutton- I mean shades
[3:37:04] <zenith0111> Out of my way.... sheep?
[3:37:05] <+yoshkosh20> Yeah. get out of the way sheep
[3:37:09] <neidhardt0> Shades trigger him hard
[3:37:10] <dinnydanny777> is that a risk dodge
[3:37:11] <feralspidey> Gotta save Kanye!!
[3:37:12] <%za7az> "I MUST KILL THESE SHEEP"
[3:37:12] <Kalarchis> dude's yelling at sheep
[3:37:16] <+BurkeBigsby> "Get out of my way!" Then proceeds to mangle sheep.
[3:37:18] <egoat> music is all remixed
[3:37:19] <Gunnehsan> watame did nothing wrong
[3:37:22] <%solracc25> sheep must die
[3:37:23] <%ShinobiPhoenix> if the stream is still going, I should probably close the stream soon to avoid what comes next
[3:37:27] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> so Nier is just kinda nuts from the start
[3:37:30] <neidhardt0> shades popped up but the sheep got in the way lol
[3:37:30] <dinnydanny777> I did not know you had a KH2 reversal move
[3:37:32] <%Monkeyweed21> dont forget about your dark hand
[3:37:36] <%cvp5127> fist them
[3:37:48] <%ringabal> AND HERE COMES THE GIANT FIST
[3:37:50] <$RealThiele> p a u n c h
[3:37:51] <TonberryLives> BIG FIST
[3:37:54] <MicrotonalMatt> Onier-chan
[3:37:55] <feralspidey> I just realized the book does the ranged combat like drones do in Automata
[3:37:55] <cheapdoc> The hand you masturbate with
[3:37:58] <LycheeMusings> did Takahisa Taura working on the game improve the combat? Does it feel closer to Automata or OG?
[3:38:00] <zenith0111> GOD HAND
[3:38:04] <%zuzuxiv> bonk
[3:38:09] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I could have been playing all last night, but Falcon and WS and Mortal Kombat happened
[3:38:09] <penitentpendant> Cast "Fist" for MAXIMUM DAMAGE
[3:38:12] <egoat> god
[3:38:16] <%solracc25> ORA
[3:38:17] <shieldecho> @Chester_goes_Berserk There's a short story that has him kill someone while killing shades and remarking that it didn't feel that different
[3:38:17] <egoat> you just exploded that sheep
[3:38:23] <ScreamLord> I wish we could choose to play as Pap NieR
[3:38:24] <%zuzuxiv> fisting sheep
[3:38:27] <feralspidey> tenderize that meat
[3:38:27] <LorcaNomad> borgor
[3:38:29] <DeathByPoke7> fuck that sheep
[3:38:30] <zenith0111> @lycheemusings Auto but keeps the flow of the original if that makes sense
[3:38:32] <yourliteraldog> Punch a goat till it dies
[3:38:33] <CurrySauseBandit> @cheapdoc These hands still aren't big enough. :(
[3:38:42] <%BoxNavy> burger boy
[3:38:45] <%solracc25> ORA!
[3:38:45] <%ringabal> Who knew the Roxas Reversal could be so versatile
[3:38:45] <egoat> @yourliteraldog :(
[3:38:47] <%Maids4lyfe> Hey this isn't New Zealand
[3:38:47] <+BurkeBigsby> You will enjoy your twink in shorts and like it.
[3:38:58] <cheapdoc> @CurrySauseBandit Not small enough for me, can't really make them microscopic
[3:38:58] <+PrimalDweeb> Murder of sheep, means profit for Pat.
[3:39:01] <%Ranryu692> it isn't supposed to be
[3:39:08] <%Monkeyweed21> just like how Nier stretched out his butthole
[3:39:11] <neidhardt0> @chester_goes_berserk Papa nier was pretty bloodthirsty from the beginning
[3:39:18] <yourliteraldog> He is only racist sometimes
[3:39:20] <neptious> "His name isn't NieR" - Yoko
[3:39:24] <NicholasKane> buy maps?
[3:39:26] <zenith0111> Papa Nier is played up as a dumby
[3:39:28] <%ShinobiPhoenix> good guy and racist to non-Aerie
[3:39:29] <radioamnesiac> @Monkeyweed21 wh..what
[3:39:29] <Blank9> brother nier canonically DID stretch out his butthole
[3:39:31] <%Mendin> Papa Nier had testosterone to spare
[3:39:34] <%Mendin> Big boy
[3:39:41] <%solracc25> money for medicine
[3:39:45] <+TenguGemini> papa The Protagonist
[3:39:46] <LycheeMusings> @zenith0111 I have a soft spot for the original's jank combat, but I admit that its probably for the best that its closer to Automata
[3:39:47] <+Dumb_Parrot> I really like the idea of technology that uses magic like Grimoire Weiss.
[3:39:49] <shieldecho> @neptious "Yeah but for simplicity we're gonna keep calling him that" - everyone
[3:39:59] <Murphio_GS> Mutton time
[3:40:00] <%ShinobiPhoenix> beat children with mutton
[3:40:02] <Blank9> @Monkeyweed21 grimoire nier has a story where brother nier whores himself out at seafront village for medicine money
[3:40:05] <+Zanzibar_Junker> I keep thinking of Seinfeld
[3:40:07] <+mikesapartment> infinity mutton
[3:40:09] <%solracc25> Have it all
[3:40:10] <%Mendin> @Dumb_Parrot Boy have we got a secret laboratory level for you then!
[3:40:11] <LoneFonte> repeatable?
[3:40:12] <+PrimalDweeb> You can just keep selling mutton.
[3:40:12] <LycheeMusings> FEED CHILD
[3:40:13] <%Monkeyweed21> @radioamnesiac Nier has a very loose butthole from hooking it to by Yonah meds
[3:40:15] <Botman_R> ALL THE MUTTON
[3:40:16] <+BurkeBigsby> So what is the meaning behind Nier?
[3:40:17] <Murphio_GS> Repeatable quest
[3:40:17] <zenith0111> @tengugemini I love Nier but fuck Niers combat lmao. Anything past that is a big plus to me
[3:40:20] <AllenDeadman> yup. repeatable
[3:40:21] <neptious> Is this the YorHa Dwarf Apocalypse questline?
[3:40:22] <%Mr_Pylon> they can't get enough muton
[3:40:22] <%Monkeyweed21> @Blank9 I am aware
[3:40:24] <+Goatllama> Holy shit, I actually did hear "here's your mutton, m'am"
[3:40:32] <MicrotonalMatt> The R in NieR stands for Nier
[3:40:35] <+Zanzibar_Junker> this is good for weapon
[3:40:37] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> @shieldecho yeah he's messed up the whole time I guess from early experiences
[3:40:42] <DeathByPoke7> murder the sheep for the children
[3:40:42] <%solracc25> Buy infinity
[3:40:42] <Laecerelius> Good ol repeatable quests!
[3:40:44] <majindusto> NEVER-ENDING  MUTTON
[3:40:45] <%PettyFunk> Did Pat get the 4 Yorha DLC?
[3:40:49] <Blank9> man why's it gotta go to thread instead of reply
[3:40:56] <zenith0111> Nier spelled backwards is Drakengard
[3:40:57] <%Monkeyweed21> @neptious apparently Annogg is in this game
[3:40:58] <softbirby> why the game called nier anyway
[3:40:58] <LycheeMusings> The R in NieR stands for Replicant duh
[3:41:00] <Zourath> The N in NieR stands for muttoN.
[3:41:01] <%Ranryu692> it's why we invented them
[3:41:06] <cheapdoc> The R in NieR stands for dRakengaRd
[3:41:10] <+Dumb_Parrot> @Mendin I remember that. Never played myself but watched it all. I'll buy this one when the wallet allows it. lol
[3:41:13] <%solracc25> Mutton May Cry
[3:41:16] <%Jeshk0> sheep are pretty tasty
[3:41:17] <dinnydanny777> There are no sheep in Automata, is this why? limesD
[3:41:17] <majindusto> I've  never had it
[3:41:22] <LycheeMusings> Ending M: You Cannot (M)utton
[3:41:22] <Blank9> they're not the welsh, then
[3:41:24] <%Ranryu692> the R in NieR stands for Round asses
[3:41:29] <blackbaron98> I have a feeling that sheep meat is good
[3:41:33] <MicrotonalMatt> But if the R in NieR stands for Replicant then shouldn’t the gestalt version be... oh...
[3:41:33] <yourliteraldog> It's impossible
[3:41:38] <zenith0111> PogU
[3:41:43] <+BurkeBigsby> Oh god the junk heap NotLikeThis
[3:41:43] <CurrySauseBandit> @cheapdoc But we can good sir. Although that might be the maximum size. With the power of Dragon Blood Magic. We can make microscopic black scrawl microbodies that look like hands! Ezpz
[3:41:45] <+TenguGemini> Oh lamb and mutton are good
[3:41:48] <+PrimalDweeb> If you want the tulips, you should save; and then go south.
[3:41:54] <neptious> 1.22474487139 ratio booty
[3:41:55] <cheapdoc> The R in NieR stands for [Not NieR]
[3:41:57] <majindusto> BIGGER NUMBER?
[3:42:01] <Laecerelius> Time for more sadness!
[3:42:06] <pixelkenj> I think they switched the Junkyard ans Seafront events around from the original game
[3:42:07] <%muXPerience> Man, you say
[3:42:09] <%solracc25> or a magic book
[3:42:11] <%Maids4lyfe> knowing the things that happen and stuff, Popola and Devola helping you makes no sense
[3:42:12] <%walternatorz> does she have a drug problem?
[3:42:14] <%ringabal> Popola needs to Toke up
[3:42:14] <%Monkeyweed21> DOPOLA MORE LIKE
[3:42:16] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Man?
[3:42:24] <+ALazo> but... she's a robot
[3:42:27] <%ShinobiPhoenix> or you buy them or KILL SHADES
[3:42:28] <+BurkeBigsby> She has to be lying about needing herbs considering her...condition, no?
[3:42:31] <%alcors_wisdom> if you think about it cocaine is a herbal remedy
[3:42:34] <pixelkenj> You're supposed to get lost fishing before doing the Junkyard
[3:42:36] <cardamomo88> LUL ques go speed
[3:42:36] <%solracc25> Get drugs
[3:42:38] <%Rumbutt> Wait why DOES she need those herbs?
[3:42:39] <Vertigheist> @ALazo shhhh
[3:42:39] <%PettyFunk> The “R” in NieR stands for “Reach for the moon”
[3:42:43] <%BoxNavy> CiGrip
[3:42:47] <LycheeMusings> Popola? Old? Nah
[3:42:48] <%watts121> Even Androids love cocaine
[3:42:52] <zenith0111> Fishing is a mood in Nier
[3:42:52] <yourliteraldog> For 4/20
[3:42:52] <%muXPerience> Get hired at the tavern? I dont like those tags
[3:42:56] <%solracc25> a pick me up
[3:42:59] <%Maids4lyfe> @BurkeBigsby maybe she runs on bio diesel
[3:43:00] <+Dumb_Parrot> Sssshh Nier boy must not know!
[3:43:01] <shieldecho> it's fine, it's not like it's a mackerel
[3:43:02] <Zourath> The R in NieR stands for "pRotagonist who isn't named Nier".
[3:43:05] <dinnydanny777> @alcors_wisdom Cocaine was used as a medicine historically
[3:43:07] <%Monkeyweed21> They  can still get drunk and do drugs @PatStaresAt
[3:43:08] <cheapdoc> Man, NieR focuses so much in trying to heal Yona, that he's never really there for her. That's really sad
[3:43:09] <+killer_squid1990> god I love the landing
[3:43:10] <neptious> Did they fix the eye-searing bloom?
[3:43:12] <+killer_squid1990> it's so fucking good
[3:43:16] <LycheeMusings> Popola? more like Cocola
[3:43:17] <Kalarchis> Even androids like that dank green
[3:43:24] <SulfurousAcid> sadly @neptious
[3:43:30] <Blank9> The R in NieR stands for Strands
[3:43:36] <+blastazoid00> How does the combat feel. I know the original was kind of janky
[3:43:38] <%solracc25> Legs broken
[3:43:39] <MicrotonalMatt> The e in NieR stands for beach strand
[3:43:41] <%alcors_wisdom> @dinnydanny777 and so were leeches and pet bog
[3:43:44] <dinnydanny777> @cheapdoc limesFeels
[3:43:45] <%ShinobiPhoenix> remember when eating fish killed you and gave you an ending
[3:43:46] <shieldecho> @Blank9 *slow clap*
[3:43:48] <+Dumb_Parrot> @cheapdoc Yeah. And brother Nier has more pathos than Papa, too.
[3:43:50] <neptious> Damnit, @SulfurousAcid it was Discord light mode before discord
[3:43:51] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> if youu take enough drugs you can hear liam as well
[3:43:53] <%PettyFunk> @cheapdoc I think that’s intentional. He spends so much time trying to improve her quality of life that he actually detracts from it
[3:43:59] <%Monkeyweed21> Androids can in fact do alcohol and drugs
[3:44:05] <%ringabal> THE EVILS OF LITERATURE
[3:44:07] <+PrimalDweeb> That's an easy one.
[3:44:09] <tattleworm> no more books, no more books
[3:44:10] <cheapdoc> Tragic really
[3:44:12] <%alcors_wisdom> @dinnydanny777 and honey actually which does have minor anti bacterial properties
[3:44:13] <pixelkenj> Devola is just the "make sure you dont miss any quests" hub
[3:44:19] <SulfurousAcid> @neptious I know, I played it on 360
[3:44:22] <%EynosStyles> what do you guys even do
[3:44:22] <%BoxNavy> books monkaS
[3:44:23] <+blastazoid00> Books are for nerds
[3:44:25] <+darkpulse703> DansGame Knowledge
[3:44:27] <MicrotonalMatt> The S in NieR stands for Zaddy
[3:44:37] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh nice, does this version have full voice-acting even for minor lines? Neat.
[3:44:39] <+BurkeBigsby> Toxic reading community.
[3:44:40] <%PettyFunk> @pixelkenj Some of them you have to get from her though IIRC
[3:44:45] <zenith0111> Androids whole purpose is to mimic humans so makes sense to give them things like being drunk amd stuff
[3:44:48] <+PrimalDweeb> Save first Pat.
[3:44:50] <tattleworm> pretty sure that map was used for fast travel at the very least
[3:44:58] <%BoxNavy> three twolips
[3:45:02] <+PrimalDweeb> There's a strong Shade here.
[3:45:03] <%averyoddjew> what version is this?
[3:45:11] <+PrimalDweeb> It can one shot you!
[3:45:11] <%EynosStyles> hit up the old clients
[3:45:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I'm kinda wondering how they'll do the dream sequence if they're doing fuller voice acting
[3:45:14] <pixelkenj> I checked GameFAQs and yeah you're supposed to do the Junkyard area later in the original
[3:45:16] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:45:17] <penitentpendant> Pat is relaxed, in the traditional gamer stance
[3:45:19] <cheapdoc> The R in NieR stands for beRseRk
[3:45:20] <%alcors_wisdom> the R in NieR stands for 2b's [R]ound ass
[3:45:21] <+PrimalDweeb> Don't get hit.
[3:45:23] <%SilvaChariot0133> monkaS
[3:45:27] <AllenDeadman> oh boy
[3:45:28] <%BoxNavy> it sure is
[3:45:31] <SulfurousAcid> he might be too strong for you
[3:45:32] <LordOfThePoultry> COWARD
[3:45:33] <rasamune> Ooh it a big man
[3:45:36] <%Monkeyweed21> COWARD
[3:45:37] <zenith0111> Roaming Boss Battles monkaW
[3:45:40] <%muXPerience> Oh, you play games with Voice acting enabled? I guess you didn't make it out of Primary school
[3:45:42] <+PrimalDweeb> You can beat it, just don't get hit.
[3:45:42] <Profmcstevie> Never, challenge a god at your strength
[3:45:44] <KeiPrime> man fortnite looks fucking WEIRD now
[3:45:45] <%Aeogard> that dude one shots me in hard mode monkaS
[3:45:47] <dinnydanny777> It's not too strong if you're good enough
[3:45:48] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just don't get hit 4Head
[3:45:48] <+darkpulse703> Sissy Kappa
[3:45:48] <LycheeMusings> considering the music change? probably
[3:45:50] <%solracc25> Those sheep are MINE!
[3:45:54] <majindusto> BABY COWARD
[3:45:57] <pixelkenj> Not sure why the devs switched the story events around, maybe for pacing reasons?
[3:46:02] <cheapdoc> apocalypse venison be strong
[3:46:15] <zenith0111> Nier is much like a bullet hell. Things die fast but so do you lol
[3:46:18] <%PettyFunk> @muxperience Oh, you played with the television turned on? I guess they make games for anyone these days
[3:46:37] <+buffn99> @pixelkenj what story events?
[3:46:38] <+mikesapartment> that boy respawns
[3:46:40] <cheapdoc> So pretty
[3:46:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @pixelkenj you pick whether to go to Seafront or the Factory first just like the original
[3:46:46] <SolumFuturae> reminds me of an area in Legend of Dragoon
[3:46:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Are there any hints to a deeper connection to Automata yet? I would figure the name would imply the remake would connect back to Automata somehow.
[3:46:49] <srcalavera94> So its their gonna be new story?
[3:46:50] <%averyoddjew> is the steam version any good?
[3:46:52] <Slimeking_Mike> Santorini?
[3:46:53] <zenith0111> Best village
[3:46:56] <dinnydanny777> The R in NieR stands for NieR
[3:46:56] <%The_Gaming_Karp> Santorini
[3:47:01] <+PrimalDweeb> I'd love to live in a place like this.
[3:47:03] <+trizetacannon44> Ilios
[3:47:09] <dinnydanny777> I meant to say Near* I goofed NotLikeThis
[3:47:14] <penitentpendant> @A_CD_By_Thomas It will be a LONG while before that comes up
[3:47:16] <+blastazoid00> reminds me of limsa lominsa LUL
[3:47:23] <CappuccinoGuil> @averyoddjew apparently has some issues with regards to framerate and physics. Current reviews are Mixed
[3:47:24] <majindusto> God, this music  is so good
[3:47:26] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @penitentpendant Ah, okay
[3:47:26] <stukamod> Gottem
[3:47:28] <+tetraes> in automata they explain the events of the 1st game lol @A_CD_By_Thomas
[3:47:28] <dinnydanny777> It looks like that area from Sonic Unleashed
[3:47:29] <+darkpulse703> mopSweat
[3:47:29] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[3:47:32] <Kalarchis> Wow the music in this game
[3:47:33] <AllenDeadman> oof
[3:47:35] <%EynosStyles> more like ur dad lol
[3:47:37] <%Ranryu692> he has AIDS!
[3:47:38] <zenith0111> Who complains about the music again? lol
[3:47:40] <%ringabal> Oh god, she's using blackface
[3:47:43] <srcalavera94> bad circulation on that hang
[3:47:43] <%Mendin> Diabeetus
[3:47:46] <stukamod> The anime plague is in
[3:47:47] <%averyoddjew> welp that kid is dead
[3:47:48] <+Dumb_Parrot> @A_CD_By_Thomas I think only the same connections as always. Yoko Taro said it's name means it's not a full remake, but a new, refined version.
[3:47:48] <+BurkeBigsby> Anime sickness feelsbeardman
[3:47:56] <%Deft_Thought> Imported from where?
[3:47:57] <majindusto> BEANS!!!!!
[3:47:57] <shieldecho> Oh no
[3:47:59] <dinnydanny777> Good old gangrene
[3:48:01] <+darkpulse703> monkaS He caught the weeb
[3:48:04] <+forgetme000> question: does the hard mode in this game have enemies one shot you like in automatas hard mode?
[3:48:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Dumb_Parrot Ah, okay, thanks.
[3:48:05] <%alcors_wisdom> idk if my bro told me his fingers were turning black i probably wouldnt immediately jump to "thats nonsense"
[3:48:08] <%Paperware> Must be subscribed to the N pass+++
[3:48:09] <LycheeMusings> did he already go fishing?
[3:48:15] <srcalavera94> THICK DICTIONARY
[3:48:19] <SulfurousAcid> no @LycheeMusings
[3:48:20] <%Deft_Thought> THICCionary Kreygasm
[3:48:20] <%solracc25> Beans fir sister
[3:48:25] <CappuccinoGuil> Why is broken pottery so expensive????
[3:48:28] <zenith0111> @a_cd_by_thomas The things that were added to Rel
[3:48:29] <cheapdoc> The N in NieR stands for N pass premium
[3:48:33] <shieldecho> flashbacks to flower growing and fucking with the PS3 clock so as to not wait literal weeks and months for that ONE sidequest...
[3:48:39] <SulfurousAcid> maps are medicine now
[3:48:40] <%Aeogard> @forgetme000 nah, but they can kill you in 2-5 hits depending on certain enemies if you're not careful
[3:48:42] <%ringabal> He sells Speed!?
[3:48:42] <+PrimalDweeb> Get some fertilizer.
[3:48:51] <+Dumb_Parrot> @A_CD_By_Thomas It honestly has enough connections already to me. I mean, Automata's setting is a direct consequence of this game after all.
[3:48:53] <LorcaNomad> this town is SO FUCKING PRETTY AUGH
[3:48:56] <srcalavera94> THICCionary its just a book with pictures of 2B.
[3:49:00] <%BoxNavy> theyre up to something
[3:49:02] <dinnydanny777> Sketchy children
[3:49:03] <rasamune> @cheapdoc NieR (hard R)
[3:49:03] <+BurkeBigsby> Because of your lame shorts
[3:49:03] <cheapdoc> Matt
[3:49:07] <devanmuse> @cheapdoc that's why the "r" is capitalized. it's for the HARD R
[3:49:08] <Blank9> everyone in this world are weirdos
[3:49:13] <rasamune> Why is that an emoji
[3:49:13] <%averyoddjew> oh hey required items
[3:49:13] <cheapdoc> Matt you're getting to much work
[3:49:13] <gslayer14> """selection"""
[3:49:15] <%zuzuxiv> >only has one weapon
[3:49:16] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> if you can get fertilizer for a later quest
[3:49:18] <SolumFuturae> boast about selection, sell one weapon
[3:49:21] <HeckDarnit> This town sucks
[3:49:21] <+warlockwithapixie> he had ONE
[3:49:24] <%solracc25> Are the kids almost A posing?
[3:49:26] <+forgetme000> @aeogard thank you
[3:49:29] <inutaihanyou123> nier and automatas main twist is literally same thing
[3:49:31] <%alcors_wisdom> i mean if some anime boy ran right up into your face wearing fuckboy shorts wouldnt you tell him to knock it off too?]
[3:49:32] <zenith0111> @a_cd_by_thomas The things that were added to Replicant were things cut from the OG Nier
[3:49:35] <Kalarchis> The composor for this game deserves a thousand blowjobs
[3:49:38] <dinnydanny777> Arms dealers seem to be thriving in this universe limesHmm
[3:49:41] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Dumb_Parrot Yeah, true. I just figured the "Ver. 122 etc." part would imply it would have deeper ties to Automata in some way
[3:49:41] <mortificent> Brother Nier is the one that has a more Guts-esque backstory, right?
[3:49:41] <CappuccinoGuil> @SolumFuturae listen, it's a PRETTY GOOD weapon
[3:49:47] <majindusto> Gastropod?
[3:49:58] <+killer_squid1990> They're causing the Black Scrawl!
[3:50:02] <cheapdoc> Wind turbines are salt proof?
[3:50:03] <%Monkeyweed21> good old rubber, ruining the Congo
[3:50:04] <NicholasKane> electricity, huh
[3:50:05] <%solracc25> fish?
[3:50:07] <+BurkeBigsby> The biggest joke is that they're working.
[3:50:09] <A_CD_By_Thomas> How's Brother Nier's English voice compare to Papa Nier so far?
[3:50:12] <%averyoddjew> but those cause cancer
[3:50:22] <+blastazoid00> The 5G wind turbines?
[3:50:24] <inutaihanyou123> pretty good va all around
[3:50:24] <shieldecho> @mortificent Correct
[3:50:26] <reonome> is the fishing minigame still trash
[3:50:26] <pixelkenj> No quests until the story sends you here
[3:50:27] <dinnydanny777> All those bats limesFeels
[3:50:32] <%ringabal> The wind turbines are releasing Black Scawl gases!
[3:50:32] <+PrimalDweeb> Rukia Kuchiki voiced a lot of people in this game...
[3:50:33] <%solracc25> So they should have power
[3:50:33] <kinkade_77> setting is cool
[3:50:34] <+BurkeBigsby> Nothing will top Papa Nier's VO. That actor crushes.
[3:50:39] <+buffn99> @A_CD_By_Thomas he does a really good job imo
[3:50:41] <inutaihanyou123> yonahs vs is way better this time
[3:50:42] <NicholasKane> communist catboy 5g corona turbines
[3:50:46] <Dragovus> The wind turbines are powering the 5G towers and that's what ended the world
[3:50:46] <+willsg98> hey there, just stopping by to say hi. i need to go sleep. Have fun with whatever you're doing!
[3:50:47] <zenith0111> I forgot about findinh tips in boxes
[3:50:50] <+Dumb_Parrot> @A_CD_By_Thomas Who knows, maybe there'll be easter eggs. In any case, Yoko Taro loves making connections... in SIDE MATERIAL the BASTARD! Plays, short stories, and even FF14. LUL
[3:50:51] <srcalavera94> What do you mean be "Guts backstory?" do you mean brother near got hes colon streched?
[3:50:57] <%Monkeyweed21> THOSE TURBINES ARE CAUSING BLACK SCRAWL
[3:51:05] <cheapdoc> I wonder, could you recreate the internet after a nier apocalypse?

[3:51:54] <vampirate1> Oh man, I'm so upset I can't afford this game. Guess I just have to watch someone else play it.
[3:52:00] <shieldecho> Fuck I love this track

[3:52:19] <+buffn99> @A_CD_By_Thomas there's also 2 different voice actors. Now and post time skip. Ray Chase plays the older version and is also great as always
[3:52:25] <%carnelg> deerNeo NieR.....oh kootShook bawkGlad
[3:52:28] <%TimetodiveLTX> put 2b in fortnite
[3:52:30] <rasamune> No running indoors
[3:52:37] <srcalavera94> gest sister Nier has expencive tastes.
[3:52:48] <%solracc25> this structure makes no sense for this perspective
[3:52:49] <shieldecho> Koichi's gonna sound like Bucciarati when he gets older.
[3:52:50] <srcalavera94> like no dying of lethatl decises and shit.
[3:52:58] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @buffn99 Oh damn, that's cool. Chase has always been stellar, good to see him getting more work.
[3:53:09] <+Dumb_Parrot> @srcalavera94 He gives "a lot" for his sister monnCERN
[3:53:10] <cheapdoc> Why would they be switched around?
[3:53:12] <+ApocalypticExpress> You can go in whatever order u want
[3:53:16] <zenith0111> I like to imagine Yoko Taro just showed up SE one day in his mask and demanded funds and got to make his games lol
[3:53:23] <%Monkeyweed21> you choose which one you do first by going to Yonah or Popola @PatStaresAt
[3:53:25] <Botman_R> It's because you chose to talk to Popola first, instead of Yonah?
[3:53:25] <+Ir0nAgr0> It' depends on if you go to Popola or Yonah first
[3:53:26] <%AyotoCorp> My game told me to go to the factory first
[3:53:29] <%TimetodiveLTX> alright where's the non-baby lore
[3:53:33] <%Zulrez> I got the sea part first
[3:53:36] <%TimetodiveLTX> where do i read this up
[3:53:45] <%Monkeyweed21> sane as the original
[3:53:46] <%PettyFunk> Nah, I talked to Yonah first and still went to Seafront first
[3:53:54] <%BoxNavy> die
[3:54:07] <%AyotoCorp> Popola sends you to factory I think
[3:54:16] <%Monkeyweed21> @PettyFunk exactly Pat talked to Popola and got sent to the factory

[3:57:28] <penitentpendant> @Monkeyweed21 I assume it's payment to the smith. And he decided to have weird prices.
[3:57:30] <SulfurousAcid> @PatStaresAt I'm pretty sure one of the side quests involves doing your own gardening
[3:57:31] <%kujofire990> I'M OLD

[3:58:00] <%PettyFunk> SHE SOUNDS LIKE PAIGE
[3:58:00] <cheapdoc> That just sounds like old woman paige
[3:58:02] <trickster721> These fetch quests are just code for the prostitution, he's banging all these old ladies

[3:58:03] <BreakerDS> Thank you money
[3:58:03] <penitentpendant> Seed plantin' time?
[3:58:09] <Byorski> YES!
[3:58:13] <zenith0111> Niers Sidequests are best of its content
[3:58:14] <%Mendin> When you hear grandma say that, you expect a lot less money
[3:58:20] <%Monkeyweed21> why did Paige do VA for this game?
[3:58:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @BreakerDS Your money is all that money
[3:58:25] <%strakillias> Is NIER set in old Oblivion ruins?
[3:58:33] <majindusto> PAIGE OLD LADY VOICE

[3:58:45] <Botman_R> "If they were so great, how come they're dead?"
[3:58:46] <AllenDeadman> because dragon
[3:58:49] <yourliteraldog> Debatable
[3:58:51] <Vertigheist> if they were so smart why are they dead
[3:58:52] <NicholasKane> if they were so smart, how come they're dead
[3:58:54] <+A_DEAD_SHOW> IF THEY'RE SO SMART HOW COME THEY'RE DEAD
[3:58:54] <pixelkenj> if they were so smart how come they didnt ride giant boars?
[3:58:57] <BreakerDS> @A_CD_By_Thomas I can see it in Pat's stubby pores
[3:58:57] <%Agami23> that sounds like a pat quote.
[3:58:58] <iosephe> maybe we're all dumb
[3:58:59] <%solracc25> Bombs
[3:59:02] <periphylla> is the fighting any better then before?

[3:59:17] <Vertigheist> @periphylla way better
[3:59:18] <yourliteraldog> Also a dragon and giant lady fucked up tokyo
[3:59:19] <Dragovus> "If they were so smart how come they're dead" totally unironically
[3:59:21] <+ALazo> sometimes a giant pregnant lady and a dragon fall from the sky and it doesn't matter how smart you are
[3:59:23] <%templar010> PapaNier line was better
[3:59:25] <zenith0111> We getting to bullet hell levels of enemies soon
[3:59:26] <SulfurousAcid> I like how you got the sidestep attack tutorial before the sidestepping tutorial
[3:59:27] <lemon_lover28> sidestep to punch was sick
[3:59:29] <cheapdoc> Is nier actually stupid? I know he's a child, but nier the character feels dumb
[3:59:38] <periphylla> @periphylla thats good to hear
[3:59:42] <A_CD_By_Thomas> O'Brian still sounds great as Weiss, I'm looking forward to "Fine, just fine... Alright, no I'm not." I adore that delivery in the original.
[3:59:48] <pixelkenj> the hold attacks are pretty good too
[3:59:48] <zenith0111> Nier is in fact a naive character
[3:59:50] <NicholasKane> I AM UPSET
[4:00:00] <%PettyFunk> How long before art of Pat drifting on Gief’s back?

[4:01:26] <+TheBitingIrish> @YelloGek On PC? This is on PS5
[4:01:26] <SulfurousAcid> muffins are quick breads

[4:04:42] <%Garthunox> Thats not Yuri
[4:04:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @Dumb_Parrot They're not as bad as they're made out to be. The younger one kinda goes nuts later but other than that they're okay

[4:06:47] <+glgzephyr> @itsgundamu there are differences, for the better
[4:06:52] <shieldecho> @BurkeBigsby What, you want coherent storytelling or something? Now you're just talking nonsense.
[4:06:54] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @ElkRiverDog Oh damn, are the shit kids actually shittier than I thought? LUL I never really checked out some of the side stuff for the series, maybe I should.

[4:08:06] <%Ynkubus_> Quick question chat, is there good emulations of the original nier games out there?
[4:08:07] <%averyoddjew> how improved is the combat?
[4:08:08] <Blank9> Kaine gets to be awful in TWO stories
[4:08:11] <FoxInABeret> @stevenellis386 They're a made-up language that blends Japanese, French, English, German and some other stuff.
[4:08:15] <stevenellis386> ok
[4:08:18] <ConflagrationsGaming> where are all these side stories people keep talking abt
[4:08:19] <%solracc25> This cannot continue
[4:08:21] <%Mendin> I'm glad you like this song because YOU WILL BE LISTENING TO IT FOREVER
[4:08:23] <BreakerDS> These have always reminded me of Battlebots
[4:08:25] <%logoth_> I think I like the old version of this song better
[4:08:27] <+glgzephyr> it's not a timing. You just direct the left analog stick towards an enemy and dash @PatStaresAt
[4:08:27] <ConflagrationsGaming> i'd genuinely like to read them
[4:08:28] <Blank9> still, Jakob goes full on Misery with his brother in that story
[4:08:29] <+BurkeBigsby> No one is getting mad at the music. Stop gaslighting. It would be nice if both mixes were available. Like version switching in Halo: MCC
[4:08:29] <zenith0111> Its called Chaos Language
[4:08:30] <neidhardt0> Still the best song in the game imo. Or maybe top 3 at least.
[4:08:33] <+Kingtut9009> It's weird usually when I can obviously tell who a VA is I get annoyed, but I love Liam O'Brian's voice so much

[4:09:56] <+Dumb_Parrot> That's the fun about Taro characters, they're NOT politicaly correct and are capable of awful things and good things. Even the Drakengard Monk.
[4:09:59] <The_Legendairy> @Ynkubus_ I played gestalt on rpcs3; runs at 60fps. it was great
[4:10:01] <+glgzephyr> @zenith0111 nah there are two unique sidestep attacks, light and heavy
[4:10:11] <%ElkRiverDog> @a_cd_by_thomas @dumb_parrot Let’s just say one of the brothers was...making plans before NieR showed up. Understandable ones, considered their situation, but yeah, those side stories really tear down any image you had of these characters
[4:10:18] <zenith0111> Oh thx
[4:10:25] <+glgzephyr> @PatStaresAt There are two attacks, light and heavy
[4:10:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @ElkRiverDog Ah, I see, thanks.
[4:10:33] <zamzoph> @ConflagrationsGaming Yako Taro has a habit of writing short stories for his various games, which get fan translations.  In this case, the ones people refer to Nier generally come from the supplement book  Grimoire Nier
[4:10:36] <+SinisterBroccoli> hows the game so far?
[4:10:46] <shieldecho> Found the one with the brothers specifically: ***
[4:11:06] <Blank9> he's such a shit brother
[4:11:07] <+glgzephyr> music is even better than it was before
[4:11:08] <%Ynkubus_> @The_Legendairy cool, thanks for the emulator suggestion!
[4:11:11] <zenith0111> Nier has sooooo much supplemental material like audiobooks etc.
[4:11:23] <reonome> if you google grimoire nier translation you'll find it
[4:11:26] <The_Legendairy> i miss the mechanical clanging from the original track; they pushed it way down in this version
[4:11:28] <+Dumb_Parrot> @ElkRiverDog I'll assume crime 'cause money. Will take a look.
[4:11:28] <+dheng1> So who do you prefer papa nier or brother nier
[4:11:35] <A_CD_By_Thomas> That'd be neat.
[4:11:39] <Profmcstevie> Drakengard/Nier is the king of cross media IP and it fucking sucks to keep track of
[4:11:44] <donkymagooterson> that would be amazing
[4:11:46] <Blank9> Most of the short stories aren't very combat-focused
[4:11:47] <mass1997> Probably not but that would be cool
[4:11:53] <tattleworm> ha, imagine the red and the black being playable.
[4:11:55] <ConflagrationsGaming> @Blank9 i found the grimoire nier super googledoc, I just didn't know what i'd be called or anything but thank you for offering !
[4:11:58] <Blank9> Like one is just a villager stumbling out onto Kaine jerking off in a tree.
[4:12:05] <zenith0111> Nier also has live plays that tie into the story lol
[4:12:08] <+glgzephyr> NieR: Chronicles
[4:12:09] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I'd kinda like to see the big alien war turned into a thing
[4:12:11] <filialpails> like the one where kaine beats her meat?
[4:12:12] <%snugglepuggs> Well...
[4:12:27] <zamzoph> both Drakengard 3 side story mangas are super fucking violent
[4:12:34] <+BurkeBigsby> Alien war sounds too simple for Nier
[4:12:35] <penitentpendant> @A_CD_By_Thomas Unlimited Emil Works
[4:12:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @penitentpendant Fuck yes
[4:12:50] <%snugglepuggs> I think a couple are adapted in this game one being a BIG one
[4:12:56] <Profmcstevie> everything Drakengard 3 is ultra violent, if it wasn't I'd be disappointed
[4:13:05] <+Dumb_Parrot> It sucks to keep track off because most material is untranslated too. There's a light novel/manga that connects Drakengard 3 to 1 and they don't release that shit in the West. Now that Automata made money they really should, but nah. Will never happen. Sucks.
[4:13:06] <Broken_Sonex> @Blank9 That's a good one
[4:13:14] <zenith0111> Props to any writer who can do Aliens and Magic in the same setting
[4:13:16] <pixelkenj> actually the first 2 were just lucky drops
[4:13:20] <ItsPastas> Has Pat gone for any sidequests yet?
[4:13:22] <%Aeogard> I'd love to see the Drakengard 1.2/1.5(?) stuff turned into something else too, those deserve more than just short stories
[4:14:10] <Blank9> Drakengard 2 may as well just be a sidestory for caim
[4:14:13] <+bladeworksmaster> just been listening to this track, real glad I downloaded the soundtrack today
[4:14:14] <Blank9> where you ignore everything else
[4:14:20] <Blank9> but boy those caim bits are cool
[4:14:29] <ItsPastas> Oh, it's jsut that I'm about on the same place as you but I have a few more hours clocked in lol
[4:14:32] <+dirkfunk1> is it good
[4:14:33] <+Dumb_Parrot> Maaan, normal mode goes super fast, very little HP compared to Hard, I have no idea what Easy could even be!
[4:14:34] <pixelkenj> ha ha ha
[4:14:36] <%Aeogard> drakengard 2 has actual canon lore, but best parts are still caim/angelus LUL
[4:14:45] <penitentpendant> FF7R agrees
[4:14:45] <AllenDeadman> aaayyyyyy
[4:14:49] <%GarbageNirvana> So is this whole bit less of a pain in the ass then
[4:14:51] <zenith0111> @dumb_parrot Easy comes with Auto Battle
[4:14:56] <%superc37> FUCK OOOOOOOOOFF
[4:14:59] <pixelkenj> barrSqueent
[4:15:00] <%luckysteak> luckysteak subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months, currently on a 27 month streak! 
[4:15:02] <LoneFonte> "do you wish you could fast travel?" LUL
[4:15:02] <%Ynkubus_> Fast travel is the devils work!
[4:15:03] <shieldecho> Hey wouldn't JRPG mechanic be cool to have in this JRPG
[4:15:07] <GuardMeShielder> Fuck you Taro
[4:15:14] <%BoxNavy> in other words "we didnt want to put in the work"
[4:15:15] <neidhardt0> I love you yoko taro
[4:15:15] <pixelkenj> no vending machines in this game
[4:15:16] <%ringabal> Clearly, they were using the Zapping System wrong
[4:15:21] <%Valdorick> But later in the game... you can warp to the exit... as the player.
[4:15:22] <Profmcstevie> Acknowledge the better option AS you do the long walk
[4:15:23] <Kalarchis> honestly it makes sense that teleporation would be fucked
[4:15:23] <AllenDeadman> to be fair, that's a legit worry of mine with teleportation
[4:15:24] <zenith0111> Boats are fast travel points
[4:15:27] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Call a cab like Ichiban
[4:15:28] <malamepos> dragonquest
[4:15:28] <%superc37> okay now shaddup and gimme a fast travel
[4:15:29] <+megaman_sentinel> fuck u fast travel
[4:15:31] <$Futurecity10> @PatStaresAt you need 5 tails
[4:15:33] <+Dumb_Parrot> Heh, that IS a problem with teleportation to be fair.
[4:15:34] <+styptysat> you don't want to be mincemeat right
[4:15:38] <%livlinn> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[4:15:38] <radioamnesiac> that was.. clearly a rat with a mouse tail
[4:15:39] <+bladeworksmaster> teleport splinching is A Thing alright
[4:15:40] <zamzoph> @Dumb_Parrot if that Drakengard 3-to-1 manga you're referring to is the one about One's twin, that was at least fan-translated as I read it all before
[4:15:43] <gslayer14> calmly pick up rat
[4:15:51] <drawertogether> Yeah about fast travel. There's dialogue making fun of that
[4:15:55] <Blank9> I wonder when they'll do another nier concert
[4:15:59] <%BoxNavy> god...
[4:16:01] <%SilvaChariot0133> Shuddup Dansgame
[4:16:03] <+lucaflowe> glad to hear that the game feels a lot better to play now
[4:16:04] <radioamnesiac> brothers don't count
[4:16:04] <%Valdorick> Shut the fuck UP Gideon, you stupid FUCK
[4:16:07] <+Dumb_Parrot> The worst voice possible they gave to the kid LUL
[4:16:07] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Eeengh
[4:16:09] <+tetraes> that.... was an animation
[4:16:10] <neidhardt0> LOL they made him more annoying. That's great
[4:16:10] <SulfurousAcid> I hate that he does the stupid arm flailing
[4:16:10] <trickster721> What the hell is that animation
[4:16:11] <Kalarchis> like how does teleporation work when the galaxy itself is moving through space?
[4:16:11] <SolumFuturae> I would like to play a game as Accord that plays like Recettear mixed with Chrono Trigger, dropping weapons of through history for the impact and profit.
[4:16:11] <+dirkfunk1> wow this is the sequel to nier automata right? looks great LUL
[4:16:15] <+warlockwithapixie> SHUTUP YURI
[4:16:16] <%ringabal> All I hear is that Gundum scene: AUUUAUUUAUUUAU
[4:16:16] <cardamomo88> shut you mouth child
[4:16:16] <drawertogether> Thanks Taro
[4:16:19] <trickster721> he's doing an idol dance
[4:16:24] <radioamnesiac> @Valdorick y..you okay?
[4:16:24] <reonome> FUCK GIDEON
[4:16:24] <+ApocalypticExpress> Gideon is trash
[4:16:24] <+Dumb_Parrot> @zamzoph guess I'll go search for it!
[4:16:25] <AllenDeadman> I hate that shit child so much
[4:16:26] <zenith0111> @dirkfunk1 I hate you LUL
[4:16:29] <Blank9> jakob's just as bad

[4:16:33] <yourliteraldog> Why do yall hate this guy
[4:16:36] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick No >: (
[4:16:40] <SulfurousAcid> Destroy child
[4:16:42] <$WaitHowDidIGetHere> A) Is the combat improved? B ) Is grinding this section less tedious?
[4:16:42] <+darkpulse703> reeee
[4:16:48] <cardamomo88> god you take the wrong brother

[4:17:02] <%zuzuxiv> god I hate that kid
[4:17:02] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Calm down chat
[4:17:15] <Vertigheist> *sounds
[4:17:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @SolumFuturae That'd be pretty dope. Could also work to preview some of the Taroverse's later stuff, just dropping her into later games and we have no idea who these new characters are.
[4:17:22] <pixelkenj> nameless sword
[4:17:23] <+yoshkosh20> this brings to mind a joke. How does a radish discipline its child? by beeting it.
[4:17:23] <devanmuse> they hate him because Yuri is doing TOO GOOD A JOB playing a whiny kid
[4:17:24] <+megaman_sentinel> this quest
[4:17:24] <radioamnesiac> chat calmed all the way down
[4:17:28] <Broken_Sonex> @zanzibar_junker YOU CALM DOWN
[4:17:31] <TonberryLives> Ooooo added context that the older bro knew
[4:17:32] <Profmcstevie> If Yoko Taro was a real one he'd force us to remember the activation code
[4:17:34] <+Zanzibar_Junker> You guys really hate kids acting like kids
[4:17:35] <+Dumb_Parrot> If only it was a younger child and voice it would be OK. Children need their moms. But he's too tall and his voice is awfuly annoying, so I get why ppl hate it LUL
[4:17:35] <iosephe> ***** deserved better
[4:17:39] <%Valdorick> If its under the age of 10, its gets suplexed again
[4:17:47] <%ringabal> Hoo boy
[4:17:53] <Vertigheist> never calm down for child bullying
[4:17:54] <+tactician0> their mom a hoe lmoa
[4:18:03] <neidhardt0> I don't hate the kid, I think they did great giving him an annoying voice.
[4:18:04] <cardamomo88> he looks old enough to know better
[4:18:08] <+BurkeBigsby> Let me slap this egg and titanium onto this sword so you can magic spear some robots in bitch boy shorts. Videogames are grape.
[4:18:10] <%za7az> @radioamnesiac DESTROY THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION HyperTiger
[4:18:11] <zenith0111> Yoko Taro also has stated he only writes when he drinks soooooo...
[4:18:28] <Profmcstevie> Yoko Taro got some demons then
[4:18:30] <radioamnesiac> @radioamnesiac ...of chat?
[4:18:31] <Vertigheist> @zenith0111 what a king
[4:18:33] <Broken_Sonex> @cardamomo88 This
[4:18:36] <cardamomo88> ??? pat
[4:18:38] <%Agami23> of course there is pat.
[4:18:43] <Blank9> these kids do a great job showing how weird everyone is
[4:18:49] <Qsmash_> whatever nerd lmao
[4:18:54] <Astrophizz> maybe in a sound library
[4:18:54] <+Zanzibar_Junker> the fence door opening sound right?
[4:18:57] <%Ynkubus_> N E R D
[4:19:01] <%Agami23> of course you would know the public domain noises used in resident evil
[4:19:05] <+Dumb_Parrot> I don't think the voice is good at all. It is clearly that of an adult.
[4:19:11] <zenith0111> He says alcohol helps him creative
[4:19:22] <%walternatorz> what are the odds pat said the same thing in the old LP?
[4:19:27] <majindusto> It always  comes back to Resident  Evil
[4:19:34] <Blank9> almost certain
[4:19:36] <%ElkRiverDog> Didn’t you mention that in the last playthrough?
[4:19:44] <+BurkeBigsby> Can't have new VO actors. They'll cry again.
[4:19:44] <SulfurousAcid> Pat knows so much about RE, you don't understand
[4:19:54] <+TheBitingIrish> Ripped it's tail right off! D:
[4:19:55] <yourliteraldog> Yoko writes like hemming way checks out.
[4:20:03] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Geef
[4:20:09] <Blank9> don't worry, the tails grow back, right?
[4:20:11] <%Monkeyweed21> I cant believe Yoko Taro made this for my birthday
[4:20:20] <%walternatorz> don't disturb him and his burgers
[4:20:23] <mass1997> Awww
[4:20:26] <%ringabal> Mmmmuthur
[4:20:34] <%Agami23> they did
[4:20:36] <radioamnesiac> @Blank9 mouses are notoriously lizardlike in that way.
[4:20:36] <cardamomo88> mmmm
[4:20:40] <zenith0111> Bro...
[4:20:40] <+yoshkosh20> this track is great.
[4:20:42] <%jtdobyns> How much longer might Pat be on tonight?
[4:20:43] <NicholasKane> no they didnt, he just said that
[4:20:43] <majindusto> They had a Mother?
[4:20:44] <kinkade_77> how complex does the combat get
[4:20:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt the DLC is about the mom
[4:20:48] <%logoth_> M..Muther
[4:20:50] <%za7az> @Agami23 Did they....?
[4:20:53] <dinnydanny777> Mummy NieR
[4:20:59] <+SinisterBroccoli> how is brother Nier? I never played replicant
[4:21:03] <+megaman_sentinel> she said fuck dem kids lol
[4:21:09] <%Agami23> im pretty sure the DLC for the original nier actually talked about that.
[4:21:14] <neidhardt0> That makes a lot of sense for his motivation. I forgot what made papa nier accept their help.
[4:21:20] <+yoshkosh20> nothing personnel, kid.
[4:21:21] <+darkpulse703> @megaman_sentinel lmao
[4:21:29] <Blank9> he's a dad
[4:21:30] <neidhardt0> accept helping them* I mean
[4:21:33] <%za7az> @SinisterBroccoli Worse than Papa Nier
[4:21:34] <zenith0111> The og Nier tells you about her reasons for leaving the kida
[4:21:42] <dinnydanny777> How old would Papa NieR's parents be LUL
[4:21:59] <meteor530> Music is still a banger
[4:22:00] <The_Legendairy> @neidhardt0 he just kinda helps everybody
[4:22:02] <shieldecho> The Red And The Black does mention that Nier and Yonah had parents
[4:22:02] <rekinom> Papa Nier is now Daddy Nier
[4:22:25] <Blank9> all papa nier has to do is put the mask on to hide that his brow is melting
[4:22:26] <radioamnesiac> @SinisterBroccoli or yknow.. just different.
[4:22:28] <yourliteraldog> lol
[4:22:29] <Broken_Sonex> True
[4:22:30] <+preppyposs> how shitty does this game run on PC
[4:22:36] <+BurkeBigsby> Papa Nier was born 40
[4:22:36] <%depotagents> God I miss papa nier, tho brother nier is growing on me.

[4:23:28] <meteor530> Papa Nier- Let's be friends Kaine!

[4:24:34] <Broken_Sonex> NOT A CAKE DAMN IT
[4:24:35] <+killer_squid1990> I remember this fucking muffin argument
[4:24:37] <%JoshManVGH> Muffins are almost indistinguishable from cake depending on recipe
[4:24:40] <Qsmash_> @depotagents okay, I understand. thanks
[4:24:44] <+BurkeBigsby> Cake is a format.
[4:24:45] <%Agami23> could you imagine doing this segment and suddenly a yorha flight unit zips by underneath?
[4:24:45] <%za7az> @vampirate1 Mr. Evrart is helping me find my gun.
[4:24:46] <zenith0111> Whatever you do dont google what muffin is
[4:24:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @ringabal Wait but what about cookie cakes tho
[4:24:50] <xxshadowxx416> a muffin is a muffin
[4:24:54] <meteor530> Cake is love
[4:24:55] <trickster721> a muffin is really just an egg-less popover
[4:25:00] <%Fooguwu> How has your opinion matured over time on muffins?
[4:25:01] <Kalarchis> MUFFINS ARE HALFAY BETWEEN CAKE AND BREAD, THEY ARE NEITHER CAKE NOR BREAD
[4:25:02] <+TheBitingIrish> Muffins are closer to bread than they are cake, methinks
[4:25:05] <LycheeMusings> Ending F: In(F)idelity
[4:25:07] <radioamnesiac> @ringabal that sounds like a blondie
[4:25:14] <meteor530> A muffin is really just a cake with attitude
[4:25:20] <+CaptainJax> Cookie cakes are just cookies you mongoloid
[4:25:20] <shieldecho> Is the muffins are cakes discussion the first time we heard Paige in a video?
[4:25:25] <dinnydanny777> What kind of muffin is it
[4:25:31] <dinnydanny777> Is it like a bread muffin
[4:25:33] <%Ynkubus_> I want a muffin rn, thanksnchat
[4:25:38] <DSD24> The best tutorial system
[4:25:38] <cardamomo88> of muffin
[4:25:39] <brachydios777> Y’all are confusing muffins for cupcakes
[4:25:42] <SolumFuturae> people focus too much on the bread composition of the argument, it's more about the size of the muffin in relation to the eater
[4:25:43] <UTaken34> Iunno if you take the frosting off of a poptart does it sease to be?
[4:25:45] <radioamnesiac> @CaptainJax blondie!! it's a cookie brownie.
[4:25:47] <zenith0111> Chocolate muffin is just chocolate
[4:25:52] <+mashinchaserr> a muffin is a crusty cupcakw
[4:25:57] <%muXPerience> muffins are both cakes and breads
[4:26:00] <Broken_Sonex> It honesty depends of what the muffin is made out of
[4:26:01] <%charp35> Muffins are a cake
[4:26:04] <dinnydanny777> Is a crumpet a muffin?
[4:26:05] <Blank9> weird spot to tell you this, since you're not doing many combos in a minecart
[4:26:07] <+Mrbaconator> yonah, mr.evrart is helping me find my lost gun
[4:26:08] <%Ranryu692> @UTaken34 they sell them without frosting
[4:26:10] <AllenDeadman> stop making me flash back to over 5 years ago I swear to fuck
[4:26:11] <radioamnesiac> @UTaken34 poptarts are sweet ravioli.
[4:26:13] <brachydios777> Muffins and cupcakes are different
[4:26:14] <iosephe> cupcakes are muffins with frosting
[4:26:21] <+mashinchaserr> are scones cakes
[4:26:26] <DSD24> AWw
[4:26:27] <majindusto> Pancakes are Cakes Obviously
[4:26:30] <yourliteraldog> Oh nier
[4:26:30] <meteor530> So japanese....
[4:26:31] <trickster721> she's alive, and she has so much scrap metal
[4:26:32] <DSD24> That's sad Bro
[4:26:32] <%miguelrod777> he's so pure
[4:26:34] <+tetraes> i miss old man nier =(
[4:26:36] <%Ranryu692> "magic"
[4:26:37] <PartyFavors> What a sweet boy...
[4:26:39] <radioamnesiac> scones are a biscuit @iosephe
[4:26:42] <%Mendin> Oh my god
[4:26:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Was Papa Nier this pure?
[4:26:45] <LycheeMusings> A Cynical Magic Book
[4:26:48] <zenith0111> Weiss is fed up with human notions
[4:26:48] <%Mendin> He has idealism in a yoko taro game
[4:26:51] <%ElkRiverDog> Me watching a five year old argument repeat itself 2020Snacking brettuEat
[4:26:53] <dinnydanny777> Are pies cakes?
[4:26:54] <Blank9> papa nier was pure himbo
[4:26:57] <dinnydanny777> They have pastry
[4:26:59] <%solracc25> says the floating book
[4:26:59] <ahmz1404> this sounds like death stranding
[4:27:00] <Blank9> it was great
[4:27:00] <%za7az> @Ranryu692 I mean he literally is
[4:27:01] <AllenDeadman> the context of these lines is pretty different now that we have a proper shonen protagonist
[4:27:01] <+CaptainJax> yes he was this pure
[4:27:01] <%Valdorick> Muffins are a quick bread, not a cake.
[4:27:06] <neidhardt0> I love how he's so naive in this.
[4:27:09] <brachydios777> Pies are not cakes
[4:27:11] <+preppyposs> @Mendin well be fixing that soon
[4:27:14] <zenith0111> Papa Nier had pureness but it also made him seem dumber for his age
[4:27:18] <meteor530> What is a cake without frosting?
[4:27:31] <radioamnesiac> still a cake
[4:27:31] <Kalarchis> I camn
[4:27:34] <+preppyposs> Pies are not cakes
[4:27:37] <DSD24> Ooo the music is kicking in
[4:27:38] <iosephe> waffles are just crispy pancakes
[4:27:41] <shieldecho> Is baby sweet?
[4:27:41] <brachydios777> @meteor530 A cake with no frosting
[4:27:44] <neidhardt0> Oooh those drums coming back in
[4:27:44] <%logoth_> What is a cake if not yeast triumphing
[4:27:45] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Gib baybee
[4:27:46] <Kalarchis> I can't believe the music in this game
[4:27:47] <A_CD_By_Thomas> YES
[4:27:48] <%Valdorick> A cake without frosting is still cake, but a muffin with frosting is still a quick bread, just one prepared horribly.

[4:29:23] <zamzoph> You mena that Mario 64 boss
[4:29:23] <+megaman_sentinel> so this is the same factory in automata

[4:29:24] <majindusto> ZELDA BOSS
[4:29:24] <dinnydanny777> Andrew Oikony :O
[4:29:24] <+Gorgodrn> Goth and Bongo Bongo

[4:29:37] <pixelkenj> Nintendo McHands
[4:29:38] <%Alazull> This cannot continue
[4:29:39] <ItsPastas> Theres like 4 zelda bosses like that
[4:29:41] <Laecerelius> Throw a bomb into its mouth!
[4:29:46] <fritz_dacat> It’s andros from star Fox 64
[4:29:48] <Blank9> it's zeldaing super hard
[4:29:49] <+thatotherblackkid> Spoilers: Yoko LOVES Zelda
[4:29:52] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Hey look, another Platinum-developed game with a Nintendy-hand boss
[4:29:52] <%Mendin> @Agami23 Hey guess what the factory in Automata used to produce before the machines took it over :)
[4:29:54] <Blank9> the tower of the gods wind waker one
[4:29:57] <neidhardt0> Nier is so obviously a satire of zelda looking back on it.
[4:30:07] <meteor530> Cakes?
[4:30:08] <%walternatorz> high five
[4:30:10] <zenith0111> Spam magic fireballs yo
[4:30:10] <Blank9> it's a satire of a lot
[4:30:17] <%Artemis_Scowl> I never noticed that this thing and Angles have the same head
[4:30:28] <zamzoph> impossible to dodge monkaS
[4:30:31] <Laecerelius> Pewpew it
[4:30:38] <Kalarchis> Bongo Bongo would have been a lot harder with lasers
[4:30:54] <CursedNobleman> bongo bongo gen2 is weird LUL
[4:30:55] <%Taisuru> Don't let yourself be crushed
[4:30:57] <%solracc25> This cannot continue
[4:31:01] <%Valdorick> Pat does not play Handy-Knifey very well.
[4:31:05] <CursedNobleman> and god bless liam o brien
[4:31:05] <Blank9> dark lance is probably more essential than dark blast even
[4:31:11] <%Deft_Thought> All games deserve an Andross
[4:31:23] <%Mendin> Let us all / Die together / And become as Gods
[4:31:23] <meteor530> Thank god for Jimquisition
[4:31:30] <DSD24> I like the Fist though
[4:31:33] <zenith0111> The starting magic abilities will carry you
[4:31:39] <KitsuneManami> So you cant play as Daddy Nier right away? BOOOOO
[4:31:43] <majindusto> Am i mis-remembering the lazers leaving  burn trails in the og game?
[4:31:45] <Daniel_Is_I> I keep lance and blast and swap out defend for a third magic
[4:31:56] <Blank9> eventually I think I even dropped defend and went triple magic, yeah
[4:31:57] <Profmcstevie> Especially as that MP bar improves, holy Lance stacking christ
[4:32:00] <LycheeMusings> which is the one that has the spears come out of the ground? I like that one
[4:32:06] <+glgzephyr> mashing R1 with dark blast has been very high dps for me
[4:32:09] <%superc37> jesus, how much did pat grind to be this op?
[4:32:13] <Blank9> that one's Dark Execution
[4:32:14] <%Valdorick> Defend is more broken than magic though?
[4:32:15] <Ciglossonjr> The watcher dance
[4:32:19] <zenith0111> @lycheemusings Execution
[4:32:19] <KahnWick> so does daddy nier appear in this game?
[4:32:21] <%PettyFunk> @lycheemusings Execution
[4:32:21] <Blank9> Dark Phantasm is crazy good
[4:32:21] <Ciglossonjr> Oh what fun
[4:32:25] <%bread_assassin> I like Blast because you can use it without interrupting your attacks.
[4:32:30] <+SinisterBroccoli> who's the VA for brother Nier?
[4:32:32] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh man
[4:32:36] <meteor530> Quickly hit it with rocks!
[4:32:39] <+glgzephyr> @superc37 he's not particularly powerful for this stage of the game
[4:32:40] <DSD24> @KahnWick Yes he's playable in some extra dungeons
[4:32:49] <+WutangchickeN> Baby Nierman is completely indistinguishable from Kaine at the best of times with where the camera is.
[4:32:56] <%AzureGale> This is pretty much Geometry Wars
[4:33:06] <$Futurecity10> Listening to the muffin bit again. Jesus christ
[4:33:16] <meteor530> Time to touhou
[4:33:17] <ItsPastas> touhou time!
[4:33:19] <zenith0111> WE BULLET HELL NOW
[4:33:21] <+glgzephyr> that's that bullet hell shit. STRAIGHT INTO MY VEINS PLEASE
[4:33:25] <+TheBitingIrish> I like his crazy dash attack
[4:33:29] <%averyoddjew> is the block still busted to use?
[4:33:31] <KahnWick> God, this looks like something fitting for a XIV raid
[4:33:40] <Broken_Sonex> @Futurecity10 Who is even right in that argument?
[4:33:42] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Bombs? Rope?
[4:33:46] <kinkade_77> zelda moment
[4:33:52] <%Taisuru> YO HAVE YOU GUYS PLAYED VIDEO GAME?
[4:33:54] <DSD24> Man I love Weiss
[4:33:56] <majindusto> Zach  Aguilar voices  young brother NieR
[4:33:56] <trickster721> oh my god that carrying animation
[4:33:57] <DSD24> He's the best
[4:33:57] <%logoth_> Lampoil? Rope? BOMBS?
[4:33:59] <Vertigheist> is gestalt slated for a release date?
[4:34:00] <Profmcstevie> Mocking Zelda are we Weiss
[4:34:00] <%solracc25> Eat it
[4:34:00] <%Valdorick> "I was alive when video games were made" - Weiss
[4:34:01] <+Jonesman64> Dodongo dislikes smoke!
[4:34:01] <PartyFavors> when's the lamp oil upgrade
[4:34:03] <zenith0111> Taro shouldve directed the Raid LUL
[4:34:06] <%Fooguwu> and mario and starfox
[4:34:10] <Laecerelius> It's straight up from WW
[4:34:11] <+preppyposs> OH HECK YEAH

[4:34:16] <+preppyposs> I PLAY VIDEOGAMES
[4:34:16] <%Valdorick> Yeah, its the boss for the Tower in WW
[4:34:19] <zenith0111> There is a Zelda reference in this game
[4:34:24] <dinnydanny777> The Deku Baba from Twilight
[4:34:28] <waffleandman> NieR plays zelda confirmed
[4:34:30] <%superc37> tbh og was kind of a zelda ripoff in a lot of ways
[4:34:31] <KahnWick> did he just say Wiess swallows balls?
[4:34:33] <%solracc25> 3rd bonk
[4:34:34] <+glgzephyr> All the dialogue between NieR and Weiss in this fight is just poking fun at how lame Zelda bosses are
[4:34:34] <donkymagooterson> take that bongo bongo you bitch
[4:34:37] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> LUL
[4:34:43] <Blank9> they have another zelda reference later too

[4:34:50] <Blank9> and then like 5 other games referenced
[4:35:00] <+warlockwithapixie> Can you change difficulty
[4:35:00] <Wreckinize> is he playing on normal difficulty?
[4:35:01] <%solracc25> Mario rules 3 hits
[4:35:08] <+megaman_sentinel> rule of threes
[4:35:16] <+skyheys> FUCK MACHINES, THEY HAVE NO FEELINGS
[4:35:17] <yourliteraldog> What if Nintendo let yoko taro direct a Zelda Game
[4:35:19] <%Valdorick> So... The Aliens haven't invaded yet... why does that thing have a face then?
[4:35:21] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Lookit this baby boy
[4:35:27] <The_Legendairy> the succ
[4:35:29] <Blank9> it's not great
[4:35:29] <%cvp5127> dark vore
[4:35:32] <pi_in_the_sci> the whole game is very intentionally structured the same way OoT is
[4:35:36] <+CaptainJax> Because it sucks
[4:35:36] <%BoxNavy> hello chat i am here to tell you that eagle egg drop rates are still fucked
[4:35:37] <zenith0111> Gluttony is the anti bullet hell move

[4:48:03] <Blank9> very sharp scales
[4:48:03] <+GigaSeifer> that's why that species is called pike
[4:48:03] <radioamnesiac> fish are the cactus of the sea
[4:48:03] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:48:05] <+glgzephyr> how did you not learn this when you were six
[4:48:06] <Minorou> defense mechanisms
[4:48:06] <+ApocalypticExpress> GENERAL SCALES
[4:48:06] <+PrimalDweeb> Everyone, make sure Paige knows about this as soon as possible. LUL
[4:48:07] <%livlinn> Scale???
[4:48:07] <%Agami23> hey pat, whats a dolphin feel like?
[4:48:08] <Kalarchis> HOW IS DOG
[4:48:08] <pi_in_the_sci> though sharks do have skin
[4:48:09] <yourliteraldog> That's not entirely un reasonable
[4:48:09] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Grab them borgers, Pat
[4:48:11] <+Jonesman64> 1
[4:48:11] <+megaman_sentinel> get some sleep man
[4:48:12] <+Jonesman64> 2
[4:48:13] <SirDogBear> Thats why fish are dangerous and must be hunted CorgiDerp
[4:48:14] <+darkpulse703> mopLUL YOu need to catch fish
[4:48:14] <+kawachipto> I mean some do, scales can be sharp
[4:48:14] <%Ranryu692> I know how it is on this bitch of an earth
[4:48:15] <+Burdenslo> Fish have barbs
[4:48:20] <pi_in_the_sci> and it does stab you
[4:48:23] <%PettyFunk> I mean that’s not entirely incorrect
[4:48:25] <+darkpulse703> and prepare them
[4:48:26] <majindusto> Why are you like this Pat?
[4:48:27] <%Hilleltaco> I watched a stream the other day where the discussion was had of "fish aren't even really meat in my opinion" and I was so incredibly lost, some people barely even seem to think fish are alive lol
[4:48:47] <shieldecho> Okay I need slep, I'm tapping out. Night Pat, night chat.
[4:49:01] <%livlinn> Has Pat ever touched fish??
[4:49:05] <radioamnesiac> i don't think it helps that they come in cans @Hilleltaco
[4:49:06] <brachydios777> I don’t get how people say fish isn’t meat, like wtf?
[4:49:11] <%Jeshk0> fish are basically vegetables
[4:49:23] <dinnydanny777> bugs have organs too, just really gross organs
[4:49:33] <radioamnesiac> ew
[4:49:47] <Vertigheist> it's always funny hearing piscetarians are a thing when what's the difference?
[4:49:51] <%livlinn> Swimming sushis 🍣
[4:49:59] <NicholasKane> i think its supposed to be like, "the reasons why we shouldn't eat meat don't apply to fish"
[4:50:13] <%BoxNavy> fish arent animals
[4:50:19] <+warlockwithapixie> Man, I need to get back to playing Automata one of these days...
[4:50:20] <brachydios777> Where can I listen to this music btw?
[4:50:22] <SirDogBear> Fish are as alive as shades LUL
[4:50:44] <%ringabal> Great, looks like we're putting Fish in the Birds category now
[4:50:45] <Profmcstevie> All life come from ocean, we are all of feesh origin hboxBrain
[4:50:45] <%BoxNavy> "fish arent animals" is my new hot take
[4:50:47] <Vertigheist> I get it, fish can't emote like mammals but it's still alive but hey as long as it doesn't scream in pain audibly I guess
[4:50:52] <Explodincatz> yea fish are plants
[4:50:54] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> Does Gief actually have a tiny Richard Scarry hat?
[4:50:54] <dinnydanny777> @nicholaskane Which is questionable, many fish are incredibly intelligent, some even use tools
[4:50:55] <%GalacticaPhanto> @brachydios777 on F1NG3RS' YT channel
[4:50:55] <CurrySauseBandit> I thought the debate on meat, not-meat was purely something to do with what religions consider meat not translating to the actual definition of meat.
[4:51:05] <Vertigheist> seagulls can fuck off tho
[4:51:12] <%Valdorick> Part 1 is very chill
[4:51:16] <%ringabal> The overworld is smaller than I remember, more compact
[4:51:20] <%JoshManVGH> It's  smoooooooth
[4:51:22] <Profmcstevie> Nier has NONE of what people talk about till at least the time skip
[4:51:25] <Overhaul180> It's meant to lure you into a false sense of complacency
[4:51:32] <SirDogBear> 2B isn't there so people's heart rates are much lower
[4:51:39] <CurrySauseBandit> Most of part 1's pacing is inside the second playthrough though
[4:51:44] <brachydios777> See ya later
[4:51:58] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[4:52:03] <%BoxNavy> yeah die
[4:52:15] <Profmcstevie> Just go underground dummies
[4:52:23] <%Hilleltaco> I'm not against eating fish, or any meat really, but it is kinda strange how much less we care about them sometimes lol. I feel like they're somewhere between insects and land animals in "how much will hurting them upset people"
[4:52:27] <+chaumiester> Jerk off one last time
[4:52:33] <%BoxNavy> put my hand up and tell it to stop
[4:52:35] <+JustToWatch> I would intervene
[4:52:37] <dinnydanny777> @vertigheist Funny you should say that, I read something incredibly disturbing about Squid/Octopus a while ago, which is that they commit suicide if kept in captivity because they know NotLikeThis
[4:52:49] <NicholasKane> i would simply punch the meteor
[4:53:03] <Vertigheist> @dinnydanny777 that's cuz they're insanely intelligent apparently
[4:53:04] <%Hilleltaco> Maybe it's because fish don't really pay attention to us like some animals do
[4:53:05] <Vertigheist> it's fucked
[4:53:10] <%BlowFireThroatTotem> "I would fuck anything that moves. What would you do? "Stand completely still."
[4:53:13] <+Zanzibar_Junker> Is it over for now?
[4:53:14] <%BoxNavy> so dont get a dog during the covid i guess jermaPluto
[4:53:15] <Blank9> there are so many unsocialized dogs around where I live that make it impossible to jog around
[4:53:19] <+PrimalDweeb> They need to meat other dogs too
[4:53:21] <pixelkenj> learn all the monsters
[4:53:32] <+PrimalDweeb> *meet
[4:53:32] <Daniel_Is_I> We socialized our dog and she's still a nervous wreck around other people
[4:53:34] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[4:53:34] <+ReallyBigRocks> Expose them to every possibility
[4:53:35] <Holofono> don't want your dog to be a racist neet dog
[4:53:38] <donkymagooterson> do not murder strangers puppy
[4:53:41] <Daniel_Is_I> LUL
[4:53:43] <$insaneintentionsyo> finaoliveKaren insane120Ree
[4:53:45] <Laecerelius> Our dog hated children
[4:53:45] <SirDogBear> Title of next podcast PogChamp
[4:53:48] <Profmcstevie> Puppies will freak out at toes if they don't see them early on, my neighbour is always socked and it FREAKED at us one summer
[4:53:50] <%TheBensonator_> DOG RACISM FOR NEXT PODCAST
[4:53:55] <rekinom> We adopted a german shepherd that did not like hispanic men, because their former owner beat them
[4:53:56] <+AnthonyJMax> a dog on my street keeps barking at me when i see it(ya im black)
[4:53:57] <%MisterRockett> It's what makes that King of the Hill episode so insane.
[4:53:59] <Vertigheist> is that why woolie asked in that one podcast?
[4:54:05] <corncob333> This is what I come in on
[4:54:07] <Visorak6> And animals
[4:54:15] <doc_ock_rokc> My dogs are cool with anyone but everyone gets barked at once
[4:54:20] <Blank9> you have to show the puppy the uh oh stinky monkey early, or else they'll forever hate them
[4:54:23] <%ringabal> Can YOU tell when your dog says the Hard R?
[4:54:26] <majindusto> Woolie was freaked out enigmaKEK
[4:54:28] <doc_ock_rokc> they do bark at other dogs
[4:54:32] <donkymagooterson> do your part to counter the epidemic that is dog racism
[4:54:38] <%ElkRiverDog> Yeah, there’s a pretty awful video going around right now that’s a perfect example of what happens when you don’t socialize your dogs
[4:54:39] <pixelkenj> is that why some dogs just freak out at anything
[4:54:46] <Profmcstevie> The uh oh stinkee monkey clearly missed the window for socialising
[4:54:47] <+chaumiester> ....... call me crazy here, but wasn't there an actual study by the US military about making animals racist.... and it didn't work out?
[4:54:56] <$ChrustosKing> im so lucky my town has a doggy day care
[4:54:59] <SirDogBear> Thats why puppies must hang out with babies
[4:55:46] <MoonKing> Dogs freak out when you show up with a new haircut. Imagine what a dog thinks when they see someone with completely different skin
[4:55:48] <+CherteuseKapibara> let your dog hang out with every kind of hood rat
[4:55:59] <%Solid_Stro> psaDogchamp
[4:56:00] <%Hilleltaco> what'd he order at wendys
[4:56:00] <donkymagooterson> did gief get carsick?
[4:56:03] <%ElkRiverDog> @chaumiester I don’t know how the military screwed that up because White Dogs are a legitimate problem here in the states
[4:56:04] <Visorak6> Dogs getting carsick is a real problem, get them used to it
[4:56:07] <+Jiggisnipe> for a 4 piece nugget meal
[4:56:11] <Explodincatz> what would the dog order?
[4:56:14] <Holofono> he wanted mcdonalds
[4:56:17] <%miguelrod777> let you dogs meet mole people
[4:56:18] <donkymagooterson> you are veeery lucky
[4:56:25] <Blank9> my cats still freak out about car rides
[4:56:25] <Profmcstevie> Dog got a favourite meal of Wendys
[4:56:25] <pixelkenj> consume
[4:56:33] <%Agami23> whats your go to for wendys?
[4:56:35] <+ReallyBigRocks> mmm wendys
[4:56:38] <toobdudes> My dog’s never had carsickness but she loves to whine a lot
[4:56:39] <vile_brand> you did this to yourself pat
[4:56:40] <%walternatorz> you played yourself
[4:56:44] <+chaumiester> @ElkRiverDog I'm confused by that statement..... how are white dogs a problem?
[4:56:45] <%za7az> LUL
[4:56:45] <francomeloni97> wish we had wendys in brazil am sad
[4:56:45] <%MrP33Ps> when I got my dog, I was living with 3 other people, and we often had people over. made it very easy to socialize him
[4:56:46] <stevenellis386> there are better burger joints
[4:56:46] <donkymagooterson> that never frozen beef
[4:56:50] <blue8moon> LUL
[4:56:50] <Profmcstevie> I WOULD KILL A WHOLE SHADE FAMILY FOR WENDYS
[4:56:51] <majindusto> Wendys is Good
[4:56:53] <doc_ock_rokc> @chaumiester yeah it didn't work out. even super socialized dogs can be "racist" mostly because they see something they don't see normally. I had a dog that barked at everyone until you introduced yourself. and she was super socialized
[4:56:54] <%carnelg> psaGib psaBougie
[4:56:55] <+ReallyBigRocks> Take your dog to wendys
[4:56:56] <nevan_44> monkaS
[4:56:56] <%MisterRockett> Did you ever have the Pretzel Bun Burger with beer cheese? It's my favorite fucking burger from Wendy's.
[4:56:57] <pi_in_the_sci> you like wendy's more than is reasonable
[4:56:59] <+PrimalDweeb> I'd suggest Door Dash, but I know you have a bad history with DD.
[4:57:02] <toobdudes> Wendys is so fucking good
[4:57:04] <xxshadowxx416> but it like 11 53 at night wendy not open
[4:57:08] <Jariu> It's also important for cats, mine is a little shit cuz she never knew other cats when small
[4:57:14] <+ReallyBigRocks> introduce him to burger
[4:57:24] <Jariu> So every time she runs into another onw it's a mess
[4:57:25] <SirDogBear> Shades are what causing Wendys to not deliver Mau5
[4:57:35] <Profmcstevie> I'm going to battle any dog that bites to the death
[4:57:38] <%JoshManVGH> THAT FUCKING MEME CHIHUAHUA
[4:57:41] <donkymagooterson> your dog is guilty of a hate crime
[4:57:41] <%ElkRiverDog> @chaumiester white dogs are fine. White Dogs are dogs that are specifically trained to attack People of Color
[4:57:46] <sephtar012> hey pat how you likin replicant??
[4:57:52] <Blank9> no one does shit about their rottweilers around here
[4:58:09] <+chaumiester> I'm even more confused by that statement
[4:58:09] <Visorak6> Depending on the state it may be out of your control to avoid them getting put down for it too
[4:58:19] <francomeloni97> brother nier is a fucking edgelord and I love it
[4:58:26] <Kalarchis> 100% good guys
[4:58:27] <%Agami23> what do you typically get from wendys, out of curiosity?
[4:58:27] <dinnydanny777> It's all perspective really
[4:58:30] <+PrimalDweeb> Wendy's Pretzle Burger is *so* good.
[4:58:32] <doc_ock_rokc> @Blank9 to be fair Rotties are kinds designed to be intimidating guard dogs
[4:58:36] <xbb1024> !uptime
[4:58:36] <@Moobot> @xbb1024 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 58m.
[4:58:37] <dinnydanny777> From my point of view, the Jedi are evil
[4:58:47] <francomeloni97> some of the shades are fucking assholes
[4:58:50] <Profmcstevie> ...a week
[4:58:51] <%JoshManVGH> Never did a wrong once
[4:58:51] <Blank9> "it's a story inspired by 9/11"
[4:59:01] <SirDogBear> It has to be brother Nier so it can be more Anakin than Obi Wan LUL
[4:59:12] <%walternatorz> nearly word for word
[4:59:14] <dinnydanny777> @blank9 I really want to see if fhat's still in the credits LUL
[4:59:17] <GeltonZ> @PatStaresAt It's a Remaster of the LP
[4:59:19] <%Ranryu692> oh yeah
[4:59:19] <%Agami23> yonah's birthday is 9/11
[4:59:20] <Jathspuh> it be do
[4:59:21] <NekoUrabe> :)
[4:59:22] <%Ynkubus_> Repeating yourself is super fitting
[4:59:24] <churropoppa> wait seriously
[4:59:26] <francomeloni97> my chemical romance is also inspired by 9/11
[4:59:31] <%Aeogard> its true actually
[4:59:32] <donkymagooterson> one of the best story in all of video games to be fair
[4:59:35] <%toobdudes> toobdudes subscribed at Tier 1. 
[4:59:37] <Blank9> yeah, seriously
[4:59:38] <%Aeogard> 9/11 was a serious inspiration for yoko taro
[4:59:39] <donkymagooterson> "stories
[4:59:40] <sephtar012> the joke ending of drakengarde was 9/11?
[4:59:40] <AllenDeadman> for real
[4:59:47] <+megaman_sentinel> is the text adventure still in this
[4:59:54] <Jariu> That comes all the back way to Drakengard
[4:59:56] <churropoppa> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[4:59:57] <xxshadowxx416> did you want mortal kombat
[5:00:01] <doc_ock_rokc> @sephtar012 of their world...yes
[5:00:05] <+Walopoh> 9/11 led to android booty
[5:00:06] <Blank9> nah not even the joke ending thing, the main story of nier
[5:00:11] <pi_in_the_sci> i.e. someone doing an atrocity while they think they're the hero
[5:00:13] <%Ranryu692> Old Nier has a new voice actor no less
[5:00:32] <Jariu> The entire world situation after 9/11 jsut really stuck with Taro
[5:00:34] <SirDogBear> Thats why Yoko Taro likes the booty, he knows life is precious and fragile
[5:00:57] <%AyotoCorp> Porp?
[5:00:58] <+ReRe0183> later pat
