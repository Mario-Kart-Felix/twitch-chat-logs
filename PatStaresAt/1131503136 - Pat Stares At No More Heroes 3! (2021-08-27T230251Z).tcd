[0:11:21] <NickHatesSnow> no
[0:11:21] <Teyaric> Nahhhh
[0:11:21] <Qsmash_> no
[0:11:22] <thehullowed> Yes.
[0:11:22] <%PhantomMiG> yes
[0:11:22] <studleydoorite> it counts twice
[0:11:23] <%machshop> nah
[0:11:24] <XoftheTITANS> maybe
[0:11:24] <%rkbinder> no
[0:11:24] <+Vigonept> yes
[0:11:25] <+Bouerd> No
[0:11:25] <%XzileGaming> no.
[0:11:25] <%Mr_Pylon> does it count if you get it back down
[0:11:25] <lazerscraper> yes
[0:11:25] <+blaze__drag> that's acid reflux

[0:11:27] <%MisterRockett> No
[0:11:28] <%Wrashis> doesnt count
[0:11:29] <stantheman_97> yeah

[0:11:30] <%genocidal_cupcake> no
[0:11:31] <%Fooguwu> you've done that on stream even
[0:11:32] <Teyaric> Quantity is the factor, I'd say.
[0:11:32] <%BoxNavy> baby mouth pukes dont count
[0:11:33] <Profmcstevie> it came up, but it goes back down
[0:11:35] <ExpressNode> I remember the last time I barfed I had blood because the pressure almost crushed my chest
[0:11:36] <%AllenDeadman> partially
[0:11:36] <ttc_lover> No mouth cpunts
[0:11:37] <%hewlettfan96> Nope
[0:11:37] <notsoy> acid reflux is NOT barfing
[0:11:38] <%MoguManda> idk how'd it make you feel
[0:11:38] <%RealThiele> depends on volume
[0:11:40] <%FaderPotater> nah thats super common
[0:11:41] <GarbageQueenEllie> It also doesn't count if it's just spit/water
[0:11:46] <+blaze__drag> it's not barf if you catch it
[0:11:47] <%shootbang_exe> not unless there's full on heaving
[0:11:47] <+ttvp> If you can actually taste it in your mouth, then yes
[0:11:49] <%ClericOfSparda> mouth puke doesn't count
[0:11:51] <%maenos2> I last threw up April 2020.  first grocery trip in quarantine.  I was so nervous I puked afterward
[0:11:52] <%bassoontyphoon> It counts as a reflux
[0:11:52] <%Treuan> ugh yeah
[0:11:53] <%BoxNavy> i never got it out the nose
[0:11:53] <+dd44dostivei> acid reflux tries to jimi hendrix me in my sleep
[0:11:54] <%rkbinder> barfing is involuntary
[0:11:54] <ttc_lover> If you can taste it it counts
[0:11:55] <%Birdigalore> Does prarie dogging count as shitting your pants?
[0:11:57] <XoftheTITANS> thoughts on the Saints Row trailer?
[0:11:57] <%shootbang_exe> I have acid reflux sometimes stuff just comes up
[0:11:59] <%BoxNavy> nope
[0:12:01] <%hewlettfan96> Acid reflux ahh
[0:12:02] <studleydoorite> that's like saying you haven't shit if you shit your pants
[0:12:03] <%maenos2> no
[0:12:04] <+blaze__drag> if you eat it again it doesn't count, that's why you gotta catch it in your shirt
[0:12:05] <ExpressNode> Nope
[0:12:06] <jorniev> I AM SO GLAD MY MOM DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ENGLISH
[0:12:06] <%Treuan> I wonder
[0:12:07] <%MidnightBurst12> nope
[0:12:09] <SaltyAzteca> MASS EFFECT HEROES THE THIRD
[0:12:09] <%MelBrooksKA> That's painful
[0:12:09] <%Wrashis> Choo Chooo HypeWow
[0:12:10] <tranquilturnip> barfing includes the sense of dread when its about to happen and the relief after
[0:12:10] <%Faustgesicht> Wonder how that guy's food is going
[0:12:12] <%UvBenServed> Less, sure
[0:12:13] <lazerscraper> if anything it gets WORSE
[0:12:14] <+Seitine> Nah.
[0:12:14] <%Treuan> Maybe you just get smarter about what you eat
[0:12:15] <+tussletoes> I fucking hope so.
[0:12:15] <+luketrapwalker> For me, yeah
[0:12:15] <@Ranryu692> depends on your health
[0:12:17] <%MidnightBurst12> i wish
[0:12:18] <%kingofasgard> cos you stopped being around matt lol
[0:12:18] <%bassoontyphoon> Vomiting is usually much more forceful and involves projectile of stomach contents
[0:12:18] <T_Sasquatch> i would hope so
[0:12:18] <%YakumoYomi> I haven't vomited in like...20 years. Maybe it's actually a thing?
[0:12:20] <%BoxNavy> oh shit
[0:12:21] <%shootbang_exe> maybe your stomach has just grown stronger
[0:12:21] <+ttvp> Maybe one takes less risks with their digestive system as they age
[0:12:21] <kikoeru_san> Pat I JUST ate, please no barf talk
[0:12:22] <GarbageQueenEllie> Old ppl put less risky shit in their bellies
[0:12:22] <+jofrankii> I learned not to eat expired food
[0:12:22] <%hewlettfan96> That’s stinks
[0:12:23] <heartlesshealer> well you usually get less sick, so yeah
[0:12:25] <%Ynkubus_> it varies
[0:12:26] <+blaze__drag> that look of epiphany
[0:12:27] <Baljhet> you might be more aware of things that make you barf, because of old man wisdom
[0:12:28] <%BoxNavy> the bark hit him in the eys
[0:12:29] <%MidnightBurst12> oh?

[0:12:32] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt drink more and you can barf, or eat sketchy food

Just. Great. Keep it up man.
[0:15:03] <SaltyAzteca> @XzileGaming The feet give it that extra flavour
[0:15:03] <Profmcstevie> Being at home is more than enough going on
[0:15:04] <%BoxNavy> it be like that
[0:15:10] <%Monkeyweed21> red or white wine?
[0:15:12] <+Vigonept> I still dont and wouldnt go to that shit

[0:15:30] <GarbageQueenEllie> Pat's Liver: "AAAAAGH TOO MUCH POISON"
[0:15:31] <stantheman_97> do you know how you got home?
[0:15:31] <kikoeru_san> HOW did you get home?
[0:15:33] <%baka_sugoi> young pat
[0:15:34] <%BoxNavy> a better(?) pat
[0:15:34] <%MelBrooksKA> Why didn't you play video games instead?
[0:15:36] <%moonmintparadise> did someone drive you home or didd you literally just wake up in bed ?
[0:15:36] <%PhantomMiG> Wine has taken down 4 people I know at a bar I went to. Wine is a really killer
[0:15:40] <kikoeru_san> oh wait you can't drive
[0:15:41] <arizenarkana> My wrestling school put on a Christmas party and it was the WORST. First time I got myself wasted just to deal with the people
[0:15:43] <+jofrankii> same
[0:15:46] <%FaderPotater> yeah blackout is knocked out I've heard.
[0:15:47] <Jrocy247> @PatStaresAt Had the same experience with Vodka, NEVER drinking Vodka again

[0:15:49] <%MoguManda> wine tastes like grape flavored piss
[0:15:49] <ape_hawk> i cant stand alcohol or beer
[0:15:49] <%rekinom> Don't like wine, do like free
[0:15:50] <DevinMayCry> He got home because he said he'd never make it home and thus crazy talk was first activated
[0:15:55] <%BubbaRands> We’re there stops in between?
[0:15:58] <+blaze__drag> I assume Geif went back in time and carried you
[0:15:59] <%MisterRockett> I like certain wine. The wine that basically tastes like grape juice.

[0:25:06] <%deviljhojho_> you cant pack a good story and soundtrack on a shitgamae and ask me to play it
[0:25:07] <+Solid__Guts> IT FUCKING IS
[0:25:07] <OkamiDude15> understandable
[0:25:07] <XoftheTITANS> time to F' the HEAD R
[0:25:08] <+lordericter> its really not
[0:25:09] <jorniev> THAT IS TRUE
[0:25:11] <%DianaTheAscian> this is prob a one off
[0:25:11] <+twohitgood> tsa is underrated.
[0:25:13] <+healnavi> "oh no camera up game is bad now"
[0:25:13] <+alphonseisbest> IT IS BETTER THEN 2
[0:25:15] <ChungusQuest> How DARE you have entertainment preferences
[0:25:16] <%Birdigalore> Should have brought back DESTROYMAN
[0:25:17] <+ttvp> I genuinely love Travis Strikes Again. It was a fun mindless grind. I wouldn't blame somebody for not enjoying it though
[0:25:17] <GarbageQueenEllie> fair
[0:25:20] <%Monkeyweed21> 2 IS GREAT OUTSIDE OF THE FINAL BOSS
[0:25:21] <+HolePunchLeaf> A Travis is a Robert Atkin Downes Otaku
[0:25:24] <+DeadlyPeaks> Alt cover for NMH3 is Goddam
[0:25:29] <%kyh9> @Monkeyweed21 What isn't?
[0:25:30] <%arran_throttle> cheer500 do the jack-o crouch coward!
[0:25:30] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> always give suda money
[0:25:35] <Baljhet> Destroyman was a horrible person, and then two horrible people.
[0:25:36] <+ApocalypticExpress> pat but did you play the silver case and killer 7 and read the kurayami dance manga
[0:25:37] <@MistyMntns> MistyMntns subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 35 months! WHAT UP CHAT. I just finished playing Beat Saber and forgot that there was a stream today.
[0:25:37] <+alphonseisbest> THEN PLAY TSA
[0:25:38] <%AlteisenReiseZ> A Suda51 game getting derisive reviews just gives Grasshopper fans MORE POWER
[0:25:38] <definitelynotjayy> jeane WHEN
[0:25:38] <+kittenloaf> playing prey rn per your recommendation
[0:25:41] <+Saggitori> @patstaresat how does sudas dark souls clone work into this
[0:25:45] <Sapphire_Breeze> oh boy
[0:25:46] <jorniev> I HEARD this has the good gameplay
[0:25:47] <%gustavozxd> WHAT
[0:25:48] <%echobee_tv> That's amazing
[0:25:48] <Profmcstevie> TSA is Suda just shooting the shit with the player
[0:25:49] <%kyh9> 2 has some shit-ass tone
[0:25:50] <%Treuan> I believe it
[0:25:51] <DevinMayCry> I mean
[0:25:52] <+senfood> I CAN BELIEVE IT
[0:25:53] <Teyaric> .... yeah i can see it
[0:25:53] <@commanderclaw> Fucking what
[0:25:54] <Ciglossonjr> TRAVIS MCREE
[0:25:54] <brachydios777> Travis strikes back is very meh in gameplay, not bad, but not great
[0:25:54] <DevinMayCry> I get it
[0:25:54] <%Treasure_Vault> I choose to believe that.
[0:25:54] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> "Travis Touchdown is in part based"
[0:25:54] <+HolePunchLeaf> Why yes, Travis is BASED
[0:25:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[0:25:58] <devanmuse> ... can you elaborate?
[0:25:58] <Tracazoid> The jerking off lightsaber bit?
[0:25:59] <%kyh9> 2 fucks up the entire point of 1
[0:25:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> I mean
[0:25:59] <DevinMayCry> It makes sense
[0:25:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> you're talking like Tim Rodgers now
[0:26:00] <OkamiDude15> so travis loves tokimeki memorial?
[0:26:00] <@commanderclaw> Okay, now that makes more sense
[0:26:01] <%zeroarturia> Hope for a sequel to Killer is dead
[0:26:06] <%MisterRockett> I can see it.
[0:26:06] <+healnavi> I can see it. Travis has a good memory.
[0:26:07] <Baljhet> wasn't Let It Die the source of the Death Drive?
[0:26:07] <jorniev> FUCK RACISM
[0:26:07] <Afterman_> i also recently started to re-play prey
[0:26:09] <stantheman_97> "travis touchdown is, in part, based"
[0:26:10] <%YakumoYomi> LUL
[0:26:10] <%gustavozxd> LUL
[0:26:10] <+ttvp> I think of Travis Strikes Again as more of a low-rent diablo clone
[0:26:11] <%machshop> thanks david lynch
[0:26:13] <+lordericter> Yeah of course Travis is based on Knoxville they both fucking rule
[0:26:15] <definitelynotjayy> killer is no more 3
[0:26:15] <%ClericOfSparda> LUL
[0:26:15] <+twohitgood> when is tim coming on the podcast?
[0:26:16] <+BigCoffee> how is it based on him? Tim's a sickly man now a sword dude
[0:26:17] <%kingofasgard> ok Lynch
[0:26:17] <+alphonseisbest> MOSTLY NOCKSVILE
[0:26:18] <%cooldude69xx> Is that an insult or a compliment?
[0:26:19] <+alphonseisbest> LUL
[0:26:19] <DevinMayCry> We are all travis when you really think about it
[0:26:19] <+jofrankii> you did the thing
[0:26:20] <%BoxNavy> live
[0:26:22] <%코코꾸라> well yeah, Tim worked at Grasshopper during the NMH development
[0:26:22] <%kyh9> And it marries the zaniness with the melo-drama much worse.  2 is the flanderized version of 1
[0:26:23] <brachydios777> I knew the Knoxville inspiration
[0:26:24] <OneThousandTomatoes> don't go outside
[0:26:25] <Visorak6> HAVE WATER READY
[0:26:26] <@Ranryu692> batten down the hatches
[0:26:27] <Latija> move
[0:26:28] <+ttvp> Love Tim Rogers lmao
[0:26:29] <%Kyma1020> LEAVE FLORIDA
[0:26:32] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> can we just agree that Travis is based
[0:26:33] <OneThousandTomatoes> unless you have to
[0:26:35] <%Kyma1020> THAT'S THE ADVICE
[0:26:36] <%ReenMan350> stay and fight the hurricane
[0:26:38] <ExpressNode> What's the category?
[0:26:39] <linSP> a bit
[0:26:39] <%YakumoYomi> Objective: SURVIVE
[0:26:44] <rytisone> give Vergil regards
[0:26:44] <definitelynotjayy> but the hurricane is FULL of Water
[0:26:44] <+luketrapwalker> solid advice
[0:26:45] <Jrocy247> YET
[0:26:45] <%machshop> yet!
[0:26:45] <+condemned_15> you gonna talk about the salty incels bitching about Faye?
[0:26:45] <%mield916> Dont leave if the waffle house is open
[0:26:45] <%BoxNavy> why not?
[0:26:46] <Victory_Boss> I can fight god
[0:26:46] <@commanderclaw> YET
[0:26:48] <wolfen091> leave
[0:26:50] <%biggerswole> 4
[0:26:52] <@MistyMntns> If you live in a place that floods GTFO
[0:26:52] <crimeagentalpha> Tim Rogers biggest fan, Tim Rogers.
[0:26:53] <%Ches_Neckbeard> it's a category 4 if you're in New Orleans get the fuck out
[0:26:54] <%Romuken> nah im a wolf, my corpse will weather the storm
[0:26:55] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Travis would suggest you leave probably
[0:26:55] <+takotoots> yet
[0:26:57] <%Tarage> Wasn't today supposed to be Mass Effect?
[0:26:58] <%AlteisenReiseZ> BLIZZARDS THO

[0:27:04] <Tracazoid> We also tend to lack killer, poisonous animals
[0:27:04] <%XzileGaming> construction is montreals natural disaster
[0:27:05] <devanmuse> the only advice you can give is "move away from the coast"
[0:27:05] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> get cold as winterz
[0:27:07] <%Axellogic> ice
[0:27:07] <%Treuan> Snow would do it
[0:27:08] <+HolePunchLeaf> Advice: Your junk is not worth more than your life
[0:27:09] <%VictorVonLouche> bears and mooses?
[0:27:10] <Jrocy247> YOU NEVER KNOW PAT, CLIMATE CHANGE IS FUCKING SHIT UP

[0:31:36] <DevinMayCry> What about Bishop?
[0:31:38] <DSD24> Shinobu is so cool!
[0:31:40] <%kingofasgard> so rollback didn't really make a difference to you?
[0:31:42] <iosephe> tbh who doesn't
[0:31:43] <definitelynotjayy> is woolie dead ? did you kill him ?
[0:31:44] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:31:45] <rytisone> what does moe mean?
[0:31:48] <%deviljhojho_> "fair enough
[0:31:49] <%DianaTheAscian> yeah makes sense
[0:31:50] <DevinMayCry> But mondo killed Dracula!
[0:31:51] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt that'd be fucking RAD
[0:31:51] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[0:31:55] <%Monkeyweed21> so whats the new excuse for not playing GG now that the netcode is good
[0:31:59] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[0:32:00] <%deviljhojho_> wtf i always called him takeshi mike
[0:32:00] <+theseabase> sup shinobu
[0:32:00] <definitelynotjayy> it is a Mystery
[0:32:00] <%Deft_Thought> Yup
[0:32:01] <OldManDeckardCain> OR THE FINAL BOSS
[0:32:01] <brachydios777> Ye
[0:32:02] <+healnavi> I do remember that
[0:32:03] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shinobu hates gamers? Yeah I guess she would.
[0:32:03] <%kyh9> Dracula has been killed, you won't see him
[0:32:04] <%DianaTheAscian> fuck it y not
[0:32:07] <jorniev> MONDO ZAPPA SHOWS UP BEING N TSA
[0:32:07] <Ciglossonjr> Why the fuck is Dan is TSA did that ever get explained
[0:32:09] <%kyh9> He was killed by Mondo Zappa
[0:32:09] <+condemned_15> Dracula, you big nerd, where's my $50?!
[0:32:11] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> No More Heroes feels like the natural extension of Yakuza's zaniness.
[0:32:12] <stormhawk9891> Remember the fucking unicorn in Killer Is Dead?
[0:32:14] <%DukeOnHere> Damon in 3's whole backstory in TSA is just "fuck you EA"
[0:32:15] <DSD24> Isn't Mondo Zappa on the moon right now?
[0:32:16] <Manwad> i thought you said Miku for a moment
[0:32:16] <@MistyMntns> Havent even played any No More Heroes
[0:32:19] <%Meekest> What if YOU showed up in NMH3
[0:32:21] <DevinMayCry> @deviljhojho_ Strong Kappa Mikey energy
[0:32:21] <%HotSauceFiend> So is No more heroes 3 the THird or 4th game in the series?
[0:32:23] <Sapphire_Breeze> @jorniev and he's cool as fuck there
[0:32:27] <%Bailey__gaming> hi pat
[0:32:28] <+theseabase> @Ciglossonjr might get explained in killer 7 complete edition
[0:32:29] <+alphonseisbest> U right, u in the right mindset for A SUDA game LUL
[0:32:29] <%kyh9> @DSD24 Yes, but he also somehow killed Dracula
[0:32:31] <Pookiedaexzile> Miike Does shit like that tho
[0:32:38] <%deviljhojho_> @DevinMayCry takeshi shoulda directed an episode of kappa mikey tbh
[0:32:42] <%YakumoYomi> Isn't TSA somewhat of a sequel to Shadows of the Damned?
[0:32:49] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:32:49] <+MajorCrasher> LUL
[0:32:50] <%gustavozxd> it's not THAT bad
[0:32:54] <Baljhet> Hey. I played Psychonauts last week. It wasn't that bad.
[0:32:54] <DracaenaLeaf> Psychonauts 1 is fiiiiiine
[0:32:55] <Tham1k> lol
[0:32:55] <%Meekest> Your body is rejecting the art style and gameplay
[0:32:55] <ArgentumFlare> Suda: What if Kojima's crazy bs was, y'know, fun.
[0:32:55] <+Shaggnar> LUL
[0:32:56] <NickHatesSnow> That game controls great
[0:32:57] <+condemned_15> ooooooo
[0:32:57] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> bait detected
[0:32:57] <+healnavi> not falling for it
[0:32:58] <Ciglossonjr> @Ciglossonjr Wait what
[0:32:59] <+jofrankii> Kappa
[0:32:59] <%deviljhojho_> its not looking hot for em
[0:32:59] <@commanderclaw> Psychonauts feels like a platformer made for people with mitten hands
[0:33:01] <%MisterRockett> It's FINE
[0:33:01] <heartlesshealer> there's basically a sudaverse known as Kill The Past, so numbered games are what they are
[0:33:02] <studleydoorite> Psychonauts 1 plays pretty janky and the world/character design is off-putting, I like it
[0:33:02] <%Treasure_Vault> Of course she hates gamers, on account of their word.
[0:33:03] <%Monkeyweed21> booooo
[0:33:03] <definitelynotjayy> psychic damage
[0:33:04] <+theseabase> @YakumoYomi characters show up from all suda games/ grasshopper
[0:33:05] <Turtlepool> D:
[0:33:05] <DSD24> @kyh9 I can see that, I mean Mondo is pretty rad
[0:33:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Double fine lost my faith years ago
[0:33:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> pat was waiting for it
[0:33:10] <+vaderxyz1970> Did Psychonauts 2 live up to the hype?
[0:33:14] <%Romuken> ive watched someone play psychonauts 2 and it looks fun!
[0:33:16] <Tham1k> oh gustavo
[0:33:18] <T_Sasquatch> damn son
[0:33:20] <Pookiedaexzile> Damn Son
[0:33:20] <+MajorCrasher> LUL LUL LUL
[0:33:20] <%Treasure_Vault> I wish Psychonauts was fun to play instead of just to look at
[0:33:21] <%mield916> *but it isnt bad pat ur old hey gottem*
[0:33:22] <blackjack8182> burn
[0:33:25] <%gustavozxd> gameplay is not the reason I like the game
[0:33:25] <brachydios777> Is Psychonauts 2 is good?
[0:33:25] <%XzileGaming> oh gustavo
[0:33:28] <%AgniBrandt> Oh damn I feel like I missed something good
[0:33:28] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The art style of that game give me a headache

[0:33:34] <+twohitgood> @vaderxyz1970 yes. everything you'd want from a psychonauts sequel. (at least so far. i'm about 10 hours in)
[0:33:34] <+fetrigon> bruh
[0:33:34] <Sapphire_Breeze> LUL
[0:33:35] <Profmcstevie> It's not THAT bad, it just has issues
[0:33:35] <ChungusQuest> PREY SLAUGHTERED
[0:33:37] <definitelynotjayy> weeeehaw
[0:33:37] <%RNGbob> RNGbob subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 34 months! Since your talk on 12 minute I've been wondering: What is the most game literacy has fucked with your experience of a game? Time loop tolerance is a strong one
[0:33:37] <%Dakuu75> DODGE MF-ERS~!
[0:33:38] <%Treasure_Vault> It's a platformer and the platforming is BAD
[0:33:39] <%DukeOnHere> Psychonauts 2 is dope so far
[0:33:40] <%코코꾸라> Psychonauts 2 plays so much better
[0:33:41] <JRsciadv> PogChamp
[0:33:42] <@MistyMntns> Its a game. /shrugs
[0:33:43] <%gustavozxd> so honestly when people hate on it I'm like yeah sure
[0:33:43] <OldManDeckardCain> at least psychonauts 2 has armenian aris dash cancels
[0:33:44] <+balouie> I played through meat circus it is that bad
[0:33:44] <Astrophizz> I've heard great things about 2
[0:33:45] <$pluckrabbit> So it was overhyped
[0:33:46] <%HotSauceFiend> ITs not superman 64 bad
[0:33:48] <rytisone> Deadly Premonition is not that bad
[0:33:48] <iamsharkninja> @YakumoYomi tsa has a shadows of the dammned inspired stage in it
[0:33:49] <+healnavi> some people cant help but respond to bait, you ass, that doesnt mean shit
[0:33:50] <aliasz50> seriously tho it causes horrible motiom sickness
[0:33:51] <Jrocy247> Noice
[0:33:51] <NickHatesSnow> Aside from the collectables it's great tbh
[0:33:51] <DevinMayCry> Sounds like Tim didnt fuck it
[0:33:52] <stantheman_97> I'm sure you have one of those
[0:33:54] <Sapphire_Breeze> better than Balan Wonderland
[0:33:54] <%deviljhojho_> certainly a game that exists
[0:33:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> @Dakuu75 Thanks for the gift sub!
[0:33:56] <+dd44dostivei> kai leng isnt THAT bad
[0:33:57] <+theseabase> i just got my copy SO IMMA DIP
[0:33:57] <artoflec> yeah seems like Psychonauts 2 just figured out all the jank that the first game had
[0:34:00] <heartlesshealer> I honestly like it, but I'M not gonna shill it to people who've said they don't like it
[0:34:02] <definitelynotjayy> eren
[0:34:03] <Scrumdreew> playing psychonauts 2 right now and its stellar
[0:34:06] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Just from watching it, Psychonauts didn't seem like the kind of game you played for the gameplay. Like its appeal looked like it was more in everything else.
[0:34:07] <linSP> Why does everyone in psychonuts look like gorrible mutant
[0:34:07] <%AgniBrandt> I personally genuinely like Psychonauts 2 so far, but it's not like it's groundbreaking or anything
[0:34:11] <TG_Cid11> No allegations of sexual misconduct have come up from the company so its not that bad
[0:34:12] <%Bailey__gaming> Pyschonaughts 2 is on game pass u can get a month for 3 bucks and finish it
[0:34:18] <@Jekado> it needs a rework
[0:34:22] <%Birdigalore> Bard feels like it's missing a big finale to its gameplay at 80
[0:34:22] <ExpressNode> I haven't touched Psyconauts since my HDD crashed in 2013
[0:34:22] <Latija> bard fucking rules
[0:34:24] <Clanes> I finally played enough today and made it to the lungfish, and wow some bits are a little rough. Still fun though
[0:34:26] <%Dakuu75> "glow-up" I forgot that term
[0:34:28] <skellisquid> Travis and Damon briefly met in TSA, Traviss beat the fuck outta him
[0:34:28] <Latija> its like driving a crashing plane
[0:34:28] <@Jekado> sometimes as BRD i get NO PROCs
[0:34:29] <jorniev> who is bard?
[0:34:30] <definitelynotjayy> i drink your milkshake
[0:34:32] <%VictorVonLouche> Dancer is just a better Bard
[0:34:32] <%gustavozxd> the stuff that make me like psychonauts was the dialogue and characters
[0:34:32] <%Mathochism> Embrace Dancer life.
[0:34:35] <%BoxNavy> yes and its fucking great
[0:34:35] <GarbageQueenEllie> Bard deserves better
[0:34:37] <%deviljhojho_> its not nier tier but yes
[0:34:39] <brachydios777> So Psychonauts fans are happy?
[0:34:42] <iosephe> Dancer is great
[0:34:43] <jorniev> ooh the bard class
[0:34:44] <Profmcstevie> Intentionally
[0:34:46] <%deviljhojho_> ON PURPOSE
[0:34:47] <%BoxNavy> good :)
[0:34:48] <%HotSauceFiend> Like Deadly Premonition
[0:34:51] <Baljhet> what's that you wanna kill a man better collect fuckin' scorpions
[0:34:51] <+condemned_15> IT BROKE NEW GROUND
[0:34:52] <%cooldude69xx> That sucks
[0:34:56] <%deviljhojho_> T-they are just fucking with us!
[0:34:57] <+theseabase> HELL YEAH I LOVE POINTS
[0:34:57] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[0:34:58] <Sapphire_Breeze> go catch some scorpions
[0:34:58] <ArgentumFlare> And I enjoy every minute of it
[0:34:59] <+alphonseisbest> LOVE IT
[0:35:02] <Sapphire_Breeze> or coconuts
[0:35:04] <definitelynotjayy> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:35:05] <%gustavozxd> LUL what
[0:35:05] <OneThousandTomatoes> nice
[0:35:06] <Teyaric> You can also just sell regular enemy drops for cash and skip a lotta the side minigames in this one, if you want, apparently.
[0:35:06] <+michelangelo_c> That's just SUDA51 games in general
[0:35:07] <DSD24> Side missions are still fun though
[0:35:08] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt like deadly premonition?
[0:35:10] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> why would they do it like that
[0:35:11] <%gustavozxd> suda's a stoner
[0:35:11] <DevinMayCry> Plumbing tho
[0:35:14] <%Monkeyweed21> THAT FINAL BOSS SUCKED
[0:35:15] <+balouie> wont that just cause reviewers to score it low  even though thats the point
[0:35:16] <rytisone> get ready to mow some lawn
[0:35:16] <+CookieCutter007> Sigma game design
[0:35:16] <%Mr_Pylon> for me in 1 the side content was bad enough to never play any of them again
[0:35:17] <DSD24> The Mine one sucked though
[0:35:18] <%deviljhojho_> classic!
[0:35:22] <Meltoras12> Those scorpions are not going to catch themselves
[0:35:25] <%jackythefrost> The FInal Boss of NMH2 is bad on purpose cause Revenge isnt supposed to be satisfying
[0:35:25] <definitelynotjayy> mower got an upgrade
[0:35:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> Suda plays for Keeps
[0:35:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> gl
[0:35:32] <ExpressNode> Shadowbangers
[0:35:33] <DSD24> The finalboss in NMH1 was good
[0:35:33] <darkco3d> Can i grind
[0:35:33] <Zeikier> I loved the mini games in 1 for the most part
[0:35:43] <quinndan> Love the Juri shirt VirtualHug
[0:35:44] <%NeoCre> NeoCre subscribed at Tier 2. They've subscribed for 22 months! Sup Pat, I’ve found Road 96 to be an absolute fascinating journey. Would highly suggest trying it out. Would make for an interesting stream and good to just play.
[0:35:45] <Zeikier> some of them just got badly designed instead of fun in their ridiculous mundanity
[0:35:49] <%MidnightBurst12> YES
[0:35:49] <%Dakuu75> I was watching SphereHunter play this. Bruh, this game has ZERO-chill. it's wild-as-fuck the whole way through
[0:35:50] <brachydios777> NMH2 's final boss is extremly lame
[0:35:52] <%gustavozxd> so how's expansions on release? Do I have to worry about people putting spoilers on shout chat?
[0:35:54] <definitelynotjayy> fweedom fighterz
[0:35:57] <%rekinom> please play lisa
[0:35:59] <Latija> the xbox game?
[0:36:01] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> someone's getting muted or banned I can feel it
[0:36:01] <DevinMayCry> I appreciate that the final boss of 2 is a scrimblo bimbo based off these faceless kills you did as a sidequest in 1. That part is fun
[0:36:05] <@commanderclaw> It's on GOG with all the fan patches
[0:36:05] <%baka_sugoi> B U T T
[0:36:08] <+alphonseisbest> @Dakuu75 WELCOME TO SUDA 51
[0:36:21] <T_Sasquatch> @gustavozxd yes ,turn everything off even fc chat
[0:36:31] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @rekinom please no, that game is too painful
[0:36:38] <+vaderxyz1970> All I remember of FF was the sewers
[0:36:39] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[0:36:43] <DSD24> @DevinMayCry Pizza Bat to be precise
[0:36:44] <%Meekest> Paige wishes
[0:36:46] <%Aeoneth> My man KNOWS
[0:36:46] <ExpressNode> What is the Jacko crouch?
[0:36:47] <%MoguManda> you have to stretch your butt first
[0:36:49] <definitelynotjayy> it would kill him please
[0:36:54] <%NeoCre> FF WAS THE SHIT!
[0:36:54] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Woolie should do the pose, for the lore
[0:36:56] <+balouie> I was thinking he was talking about freedom force for a while
[0:36:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> Why are people like this
[0:36:56] <+0ni0n_L0rd> I feel like it's less a butt thing and more a torso and back thing
[0:36:57] <%DianaTheAscian> manys butts don't work like that
[0:36:57] <%chosenjuan42> @brachydios777 It's bad on purpose to show revenge is not pretty or glamourous.
[0:36:59] <%gustavozxd> I don't need to turn off FC chat cause my FC is like some 10 close friends but thanks @T_Sasquatch
[0:37:01] <%cvp5127> is this a one off
[0:37:02] <%logoth_> CHossseeeeennnnn Onneeee! Weaaytytghkk
[0:37:02] <Jail_House_Lock> !uptime
[0:37:02] <@Moobot> @Jail_House_Lock I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 37m 21s.
[0:37:03] <$pluckrabbit> yoooooo, hurricane party
[0:37:03] <@MistyMntns> I got Nothing better to do and I was exhausted
[0:37:09] <Demon_chann> is this gonna be a one off?
[0:37:15] <Big_Dream> no more heros three more like starwars on drugs
[0:37:16] <%GalacticaPhanto> Doing the Rising quests always makes me feel so happy
[0:37:17] <%chosenjuan42> @logoth_ You rang?
[0:37:22] <+ttvp> If Pat were to play more GG he'd just play potemkin. Which is fine, but it's not Jack-O lol
[0:37:27] <%chosenjuan42> IM COMING
[0:37:30] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> Is this gonna be a one-off?
[0:37:34] <DevinMayCry> @DSD24 Pizza Butt originally
[0:37:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah
[0:37:49] <bob900000> it was really obvious
[0:37:50] <%baka_sugoi> that was funny
[0:37:50] <%Ziegsy> @chosenjuan42 Take me, man meat!
[0:37:51] <OneThousandTomatoes> that happens
[0:37:52] <%DianaTheAscian> super duper early
[0:37:54] <%deviljhojho_> 12 minutes was fucking funny
[0:37:54] <stantheman_97> fucking spot on too
[0:37:55] <Profmcstevie> Predictable plot habits
[0:37:59] <DSD24> @DevinMayCry Oh wow it was Pizza Butt thanks for clarifying
[0:38:01] <+ttvp> @RAGING_1NF3RNO I guess it depends on if he hates it or not lol
[0:38:04] <kotl7> did you guess it... in 12 minutes of play? Kappa
[0:38:04] <+vaderxyz1970> What about game literacy in like Okami
[0:38:06] <%deviljhojho_> wrorst
[0:38:07] <T_Sasquatch> it was so dumb that i refused to believe it
[0:38:10] <Zeikier> how fast did you figure it out? in 12 minutes? :V
[0:38:11] <GarbageQueenEllie> Alice in Detroit: Become Human
[0:38:13] <%Monkeyweed21> 12 minutes is 3 twists on top of each other and none of them are well developed
[0:38:16] <%MoguManda> OOF critical hit
[0:38:16] <%DianaTheAscian> its also a eye roll twist
[0:38:22] <%baka_sugoi> i can see that
[0:38:30] <Zeikier> oh damn?
[0:38:34] <+LandOfTheWay> did pat just start or just finish?
[0:38:35] <%MoguManda> if you realize the mystery early the case becomes unbearable
[0:38:38] <%Meekest> Character has a very specific animation
[0:38:38] <DevinMayCry> @DSD24 I dunno if they changed it to be less obvious or for the sequel to be less wacky with it but yeah. The logo and everything is canonized in 2 but its supposed to be same buisness
[0:38:39] <+OverzealousEuthanasiast> Chekov's plot twist?
[0:38:40] <%DukeOnHere> "The defense calls Ima D. Killer to the stand"
[0:38:45] <Profmcstevie> I know who did it, here comes 20 minutes of "whatabout this" in this case
[0:38:46] <Baljhet> we're still in pre-game ramble
[0:38:46] <%XzileGaming> i miss Fuggins
[0:38:47] <ExpressNode> I played every one except for PW 6 and the most recent release
[0:38:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> oh I can see that, I watched a shit ton of mystery as a kid and yeah
[0:38:54] <heartlesshealer> Yeah Justice For All part
[0:38:58] <Zero_Jacks> lytSORRYPAL
[0:39:01] <%gustavozxd> "he told me he was gonna do the thing. BUT LITTLE DID I KNOW THAT WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN" I HAAAAAAAAATE that
[0:39:07] <richmon__> who didnt guess sheik was zelda?
[0:39:08] <+BigCoffee> Have you tried Great Ace attorney?
[0:39:16] <%kingofasgard> my brother and i are going through them now and yeah
[0:39:16] <%Monkeyweed21> the circus case?
[0:39:17] <%baka_sugoi> mystery genres  ResidentSleeper
[0:39:23] <%kingofasgard> the fuckin circus dragged

[1:04:02] <OldManDeckardCain> the start was so strong pat had to shit out all his excess excitement
[1:04:12] <simifu> Taking a shit is a good analogy for saving, you do it at least once a day.
[1:04:34] <+HolePunchLeaf> @simifu not after 25 Sadge
[1:04:50] <%Super_Okuman> I was watching the stream and playing Sekiro, but I can't focus on the armless samurai dude while this shit is going on
[1:04:56] <brachydios777> I like that Travis has matured somewhat
[1:04:59] <ExpressNode> So I plan on buying a CPU but stuck on which one? Should I get a 5800x or a 5900x?
[1:05:02] <simifu> 25 monkaS
[1:05:02] <%KineticZen> I know people who only defecate once a week
[1:05:07] <%KineticZen> They must lose a lot of progress
[1:05:08] <+ttvp> I wish I had a cat like Jeane
[1:05:14] <+RandyFistburgers> How was your save???
[1:05:31] <+HolePunchLeaf> @KineticZen that's how you find IRL speedrunners
[1:05:45] <%KineticZen> 5800x would be a better value overall, but it depends on if you're doing a lot of intensive multitasking, or streaming. 5900x in that case
[1:05:51] <%BoxNavy> for me? :)
[1:05:52] <StarMechV> you took a massive shit?
[1:05:52] <%RonaldMcDownload> he brought the turd with him
[1:05:55] <%DedlokPM> @KineticZen only if they die

[2:24:19] <TimetodiveLTX> lmao
[2:24:23] <smagloooshy> PogChamp
[2:24:26] <%silvery_cricket> Digital Grunge
[2:24:26] <lazerscraper> just realized the opening and closing of the status screen is the jingle
[2:24:31] <lazerscraper> thats great
[2:24:37] <+MoroseLoki> SeemsGood
[2:24:48] <+bear_breaker20> all this music is sick
[2:24:50] <+senfood> Racist.

[2:24:59] <+senfood> Oh wait no it actually was the same alien.
[2:25:00] <+Pachi3000> pro developer move: embrace the Switch's processing power and make your graphics shit on purpose
[2:25:04] <DickieWoodsmall_279> he's really fast
[2:25:05] <+tigerfang86> Fashion Alien

[2:25:16] <Zeif00> more style
[2:25:29] <jtsoppy137> i would Hope do
[2:25:33] <+tigerfang86> as long as it feels good to run around it's fine
[2:25:34] <+ApocalypticExpress> for now
[2:25:36] <+TopTieramisu> AESTHETIC
[2:25:36] <+alphonseisbest> WORTH
[2:25:36] <%silvery_cricket> Digital Grunge
[2:25:38] <%charp35> It runs at 60 in battle dosent it?
[2:25:38] <linSP> so opposite of deadly premonition
[2:25:39] <Kain5707> looks like an early PS2 game that runs at 60?
[2:25:41] <%Romuken> oh yeah no, the combat sections are sweeeet
[2:25:43] <SaltyAzteca> Cruelty Squad, Killer 7, to name a few
[2:25:45] <%JohnAtDawn> Which is very Suda
[2:25:45] <+tigerfang86> Grungeee
[2:25:46] <GarbageQueenEllie> run well or look good, that's the rule
[2:25:47] <+Pachi3000> Yeah it looks like it functions
[2:25:55] <alexandrecau> Deadly premonition 2 tried that but didn't run so well
[2:25:55] <+CookieCutter007> is it 30 or 60
[2:25:57] <DancesWitBalrog> Deadly Premonition 2 has left the chat LUL
[2:26:03] <+Pachi3000> god the texture pop, lol
[2:26:04] <Shwepie> Unlike Deadly Premonition where the open world looked and played like shit as an aesthetic choice?
[2:26:05] <+Standard_Enemy> Combat runs buttery smooth and thats all that matters in an action game
[2:26:06] <AstrodropGaming> A solid 20 fps sure
[2:26:07] <lazuli_alter> @charp35 butter smooth 60 at all times during battle
[2:26:09] <Raven_In_A_Tree> I does look like something I would've downloaded for free on Xbox 360 and played for 2 hours then deleted
[2:26:09] <verscoll> this is running way better than DP2 at launch
[2:26:10] <Kain5707> LUL
[2:26:11] <iosephe> Deadly Premonition 2, 15 FPS is an aesthetic
[2:26:12] <sennoh> time will not be kind to this game I feel
[2:26:13] <%MidnightBurst12> LUL
[2:26:16] <jtsoppy137> 26
[2:26:17] <%FaderPotater> i feel like if the game looked super good it would feel wrong.
[2:26:20] <linSP> silky smooth
[2:26:22] <simifu> @PatStaresAt  please save
[2:26:22] <+FelIian> same can't be said for Deadly Premonition 2 @PatStaresAt
[2:26:24] <+Pachi3000> that sweet as 29-o
[2:26:27] <TimetodiveLTX> @charp35 thanks for signing off on that
[2:26:27] <%jackythefrost> @CookieCutter007 Openworld is 30, Combat is 60
[2:26:28] <%silvery_cricket> LOOK AT THESE PS2 WALL TEXTURES
[2:26:28] <Noktifer> Thought Matt said it was 60 at all times. did I miss something?
[2:26:29] <%DedlokPM> Unlike Deadly Premonition 2 which looks like shit AND runs like shit. doodSad
[2:26:30] <+condemned_15> that 1 frame makes all the difference
[2:26:32] <+MoroseLoki> I have and yall have played worse
[2:26:41] <Toni_Master43> It kinda looks like those extreme performance mods for Skyrim
[2:26:42] <TimetodiveLTX> honestly 30 isn't so bad if you're just wandering around
[2:26:42] <+Pachi3000> NO LITTERING
[2:26:45] <jtsoppy137> OH YEAH

[2:33:28] <+TopTieramisu> 60 fps on the switch? PogChamp
[2:33:28] <TimetodiveLTX> 60 when it matters
[2:33:30] <AstrodropGaming> They made sure the combat is a solid 60
[2:33:32] <simifu> open world is hard to do, levels not so much
[2:33:33] <$OfficerMods> open world preformance who cares make the fighting 60
[2:33:34] <+Pachi3000> Because that's where all the good programming went
[2:33:37] <+tigerfang86> Yeah probably!
[2:33:38] <%RealThiele> they knew whats up
[2:33:38] <miucsa51> ye
[2:33:38] <+HolePunchLeaf> SUDA ain't stupid, he knew to hit 60 in the fights
[2:33:39] <jtsoppy137> ye
[2:33:39] <+twohitgood> it's the framerate universe again
[2:33:40] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah, they put all the budget into the fights
[2:33:41] <%pupil31> Gulags lol
[2:33:41] <%JoshManVGH> In fight space
[2:33:41] <smagloooshy> the frames are where it matters
[2:33:42] <%octavian_wolf> frameraaaaate dimension
[2:33:44] <Profmcstevie> Yes we established this, they clearly struggle in an open world but in enclosed environments
[2:33:44] <brachydios777> Ye
[2:33:44] <+Vigonept> frame rate zones
[2:33:44] <Kain5707> good optimization
[2:33:44] <+CookieCutter007> the Astral Chain strat
[2:33:44] <+ApocalypticExpress> frame rate dimension
[2:33:46] <radregice> there are levels i'm guessing
[2:33:46] <Slim_Lipid> Kowloon's FPS City
[2:33:49] <mattdaddyd101> so when it matters
[2:33:50] <Saltmeisterr> THE FRAMERATE DIMENSION
[2:33:50] <supergoblinpunch> The framerate dimension
[2:33:50] <miucsa51> yes
[2:33:54] <Saltmeisterr> IT RETURNS
[2:34:00] <MuzikB0x_YT> Hey Pat ! Do you play on Spicy ?
[2:34:00] <+Pachi3000> The Realm of Frames
[2:34:06] <TimetodiveLTX> don't let me into my zone (framerate dimension)
[2:34:06] <%MashinChaserR> nonstop infinite framerate
[2:34:09] <OneThousandTomatoes> the gamespot reveiw did talk about it having a very strong start
[2:34:10] <%silvery_cricket> Just go dead center you coward
[2:34:11] <Baljhet> this is on Bitter
[2:34:14] <+Pachi3000> Travis (Jack It Off)
[2:34:14] <greatspaceadventure> MAN WHAT this game released TODAY?!?!/
[2:34:15] <+alphonseisbest> YUP
[2:34:17] <MuzikB0x_YT> oh no says "bitter"
[2:34:18] <albret__einstrong> put it dead centre of the screen
[2:34:21] <+ApocalypticExpress> the garden of framerates
[2:34:23] <%KuroStardust> this song is called BEAST TEST btw
[2:34:25] <+HolePunchLeaf> It's in the "for the love of god port this to stronger hardware" dimension
[2:34:25] <bob_gray> the hyperbolic 60 fps chamber Kreygasm
[2:34:28] <dynamic_funk> this looks dull
[2:34:36] <jtsoppy137> so... why can jean talk
[2:34:38] <Kain5707> why is the screen not mostly Pat with a small window of game?
[2:34:40] <%silvery_cricket> Top center hasn't had any gags yet, maybe try that
[2:34:41] <+condemned_15> do it LUL
[2:34:41] <radregice> you look dull Kappa
[2:34:42] <%cooldude69xx> Over Travis. Like right over him at all times
[2:34:44] <greatspaceadventure> @HolePunchLeaf i would not have it any other way
[2:34:44] <+healnavi> @dynamic_funk not really
[2:34:48] <%Kyma1020> I wished the Aliens screamed "MY SPLEEN" when they die
[2:34:49] <TimetodiveLTX> put the game in the corner and fullscreen yuorself
[2:34:49] <+tigerfang86> fuckin LOSER is such a powerful statement
[2:34:50] <+alphonseisbest> @dynamic_funk ARE U BLIND?
[2:34:52] <%RD_NX> could go for the fighting game setup, bottom middle
[2:34:57] <greatspaceadventure> i like that Travis is kinda jacked now
[2:35:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Why's he randomly calling out berries?
[2:35:01] <albret__einstrong> i have to stream in 480 so I see no difference in framerate
[2:35:03] <%ShogunNoonto> If you cut someone in half and it isn't at 60 frames does it even worth doing
[2:35:06] <+sirisvirus> sirisvirus subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 46 months! 
[2:35:10] <+m1ckmcquade1> m1ckmcquade1 subscribed with Prime. 
[2:35:11] <Baljhet> the bottom middle is the sushi bar, though
[2:35:20] <greatspaceadventure> is this the first 3 hours of gameplay? looks good, more NoMoreHeroes just as expected
[2:35:28] <greatspaceadventure> i like the confetti blood

[2:35:43] <radregice> mid pat
[2:35:44] <Shardlab> Top center is prolly wiser
[2:35:45] <StarMechV> if you do that you will cover most of the subtitles tho
[2:35:46] <%Deft_Thought> The true Shadow Realm
[2:35:47] <OneThousandTomatoes> itll block subtitles during cutscenes
[2:35:47] <@Spydurman> no no dead center LUL

[2:49:31] <NickHatesSnow> TSA
[2:49:32] <+senfood> Remember? Devolver announced NMH3 before Suda51 even came up with the idea for it. It happened in the first Devolver Digital Show.
[2:49:34] <+LandOfTheWay> she could talk in TSA
[2:49:36] <+Vigonept> cause its cool
[2:49:37] <BinaryShuffle> he didn't wash his hands monkaS

[2:49:40] <LunarRemix> She could in TSA too
[2:49:40] <+healnavi> JEANNE TALKED IN TSA
[2:49:41] <+TheAdMerlin> Jean can talk because of the Tree thing

[2:50:00] <%greasypete00> travis probably smells really bad
[2:50:01] <%silvery_cricket> Travis can speak Cat
[2:50:02] <%arcaderabbit48> @PatStaresAt Jeanne did some level grinding off screen and unlocked the ability
[2:50:03] <zhenthrim213> that just added more questions
[2:50:04] <lazuli_alter> @PatStaresAt fun fact; jeane in this game is voiced by Ike Amadi, aka Shao Kahn in MK11
[2:50:06] <+MiraLangsuir> I wish Elmo could talk. And Zangief.
[2:50:06] <niftyskeleton> it was a bit of a throw away gag as to why
[2:50:08] <buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut> @dsd24 thanks.
[2:50:10] <jtsoppy137> Travis Strikes again i guess
[2:50:11] <blackjack8182> Prothean Technology
[2:50:13] <Demon_chann> maybe you should watch a playtrough og TSA pat
[2:50:19] <MsYakumo> Jeane is Travis's magical girl familiar.
[2:50:20] <+Pachi3000> why does this screen sound like the Switch is dying lol
[2:50:20] <%greasypete00> this is a very unsettling sound
[2:50:21] <+alphonseisbest> @lazuli_alter And Knack!

[3:13:45] <%deviljhojho_> b-b-b-but its the anniversary of the i have a dream speech
[3:13:49] <%FaderPotater> this toilet watchtower was made by a divers-
[3:14:01] <%deviljhojho_> I think
[3:14:05] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> The conclusion reached by the Gamespot reviewer: "No More Heroes 3 lacks the irreverent charm and personality of its predecessors. Combat picks up the slack, and there's a degree of vivid style to be found there, but the game falters in so many other areas. After an 11-year wait, maybe No More Heroes 3 was always destined to fall short of our expectations. But to end without so much as a touchdown is a mighty disappointment."
[3:14:07] <linSP> thats right travis, diversity is invading earth, you must put an end to it
[3:14:08] <TrollKing96> It's head looks like the Robot Devil from Futurama.

[3:21:53] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[3:21:54] <%MashinChaserR> kinda chadly

[3:22:03] <%charp35> FU is already better than pizza bat
[3:22:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> FU isn't a complete asshat
[3:22:03] <%Romuken> They call themselves superheroes but they broke out of prison, the story confuses me.  Sre "heroes" what they call mutants basically?
[3:22:03] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Fu's just a sociopath.
[3:22:05] <%silvery_cricket> Fuu showing compassion and being attractive makes me think he is morally gray.
[3:22:05] <Saltmeisterr> he's still adick tho
[3:22:08] <Shardlab> Fu.... why aren't you being 100% bastard?
[3:22:09] <$Jaxnos> truly Griffith did nothing wr- I mean Fu did nothing wrong.
[3:22:09] <%RealThiele> he just saying what people wanna hear
[3:22:12] <%deviljhojho_> didnt he obliterate a planet
[3:22:12] <+coffeebearCafe> is he just manipulating him tho
[3:22:13] <SaltyAzteca> FU is an absolute sociopath.
[3:22:14] <Jrocy247> MORALLY GREY
[3:22:15] <niffinbox> travis seems more like a villain at this point

[3:22:17] <%Monkeyweed21> he blew up the horizon
[3:22:20] <%AllenDeadman> is he?
[3:22:22] <TimetodiveLTX> @Romuken your mom's a superhero
[3:22:22] <%silvery_cricket> Fuu is just to attractive to be evil
[3:22:24] <Shardlab> Why is Fu tapping into the Power of Friendship?
[3:22:24] <jtsoppy137> JEAN
[3:22:28] <%jackythefrost> FU IS GON FROM HxH
[3:22:29] <SaltyAzteca> YES, YOU DIET. AGAIN

[3:24:41] <+rbakervv> @PatStaresAt you can also build some death glove chips
[3:24:42] <%twistedj3ster> part of the charm
[3:24:42] <$OfficerMods> prolly cuz it did crash about a week before it went gold
[3:24:43] <+LandOfTheWay> you know suda did it to fuck with you
[3:24:44] <Baljhet> Isn't the whole point of animations on loading screens is so they continue while loading?
[3:24:46] <jtsoppy137> the true power of the SWITCH
[3:24:48] <%FaderPotater> yeh its really nuts
[3:24:48] <%deviljhojho_> its part of the aesthetic
[3:24:53] <stantheman_97> @thatweirdguyfromwork female with a super deep voice
[3:24:53] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @Shardlab very important PSA
[3:25:00] <%saadi90> #SwitchPro
[3:25:06] <brachydios777> Isn't Travis confused at Jean's gender to?
[3:25:16] <$Jaxnos> so what's the ethical standing on making out with a tree?
[3:25:21] <+alphonseisbest> @brachydios777 at the start ye
[3:25:33] <+alphonseisbest> @Jaxnos can it give consent?
[3:25:42] <SaltyAzteca> Limiters?
[3:25:44] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @brachydios777 I don't think he ever checked based on the precise rhetoric he used
[3:25:50] <$Jaxnos> well Naomi speaks to us so yes

[3:26:26] <$OfficerMods> 4/10
[3:26:30] <Shardlab> @Jaxnos If you talk to it and don't harm it, I don't think it's inherently wrong. Just really odd.
[3:26:31] <whimsicallifestyle> are these chips named after ultras
[3:26:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Monkeyweed21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 16 months, currently on a 9 month streak! I saw that tweet going around about which is worse: retail or food service, and want to throw in a 3rd challenger: Concessions! Its all the joy of retail with nowhere to run from the customers PLUS the unique fun of food service but you dont get tips!
[3:26:33] <Baljhet> well there's some Zelda 1
[3:26:37] <whimsicallifestyle> like from ultraman
[3:26:38] <+pectusumbra> Travis gets witch time, seems good

[3:29:16] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Richard Wakeling in essence called it boring and disappointing and I just can't look at this literal nonstop personality and charm and call anything about it boring, even if you don't like it.
[3:29:17] <alexandrecau> whatever you about to say won't trip on your words

[3:34:41] <%charp35> if you are the same color you repel him into the barrier
[3:34:42] <%FaderPotater> if he is big spinning blade do you want to repel or attract him?
[3:34:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> yeah I'm not sure either
[3:34:44] <shinx207> you want to be the same
[3:34:49] <Jrocy247> I assume you want to be the same color cause MAGNET gimmicks probably

[3:51:47] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @RealThiele Copy-pasted directly from the "the bad" section of the review, all the way at the bottom: The story is dull, plodding, and shallow. Open world sections are tedious and lack charm and personality. Some of the bosses are poor imitations of other games and genres. The final boss is a mind-numbingly monotonous slog.

[3:53:52] <+RogueCrocodile> When I need to calm down I go to the community pool

[3:53:58] <%MelBrooksKA> I have never heard this phrase before, it sound like something assholes say
[3:54:00] <+ScrapKingKeita> I'm thinking of the one time I was actually told to touch grass, was at work, by this psychotic lady, who told me that it'd cure my allergies and calm down, after the lady was PHYSICALLY GRABBING MY COWORKER
[3:54:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Thats kinda why I do the painting classes
[3:54:01] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @deviljhojho_ I remember if I wanted a toy that cost more than like $10 I had to land 5 perfect consecutive shots, and I was like seven or eight. Shit was hard.

[3:55:10] <%WutangchickeN> "really hard"
[3:55:11] <+healnavi> I'm still confused
[3:55:11] <%MugenSandan> So by crazy talk logic there is now a real twitter weirdo who thinks that
[3:55:11] <%Faustgesicht> OH EASILY
[3:55:12] <%X2Eliah> They exit.
[3:55:14] <T_Sasquatch> I totally believe a person would say that
[3:55:15] <%moonmintparadise> "I made it up" is a real chad response tho
[3:55:15] <%FaderPotater> to be fair that twitter weirdo does exist.
[3:55:15] <saibayadon> I've seen people say that it's ableist in another chat once.
[3:55:16] <%MelBrooksKA> Why, there are a lot of real twitter weirdos to be mad at
[3:55:16] <miucsa51> fake sure Kappa
[3:55:16] <%AllenDeadman> ah yes, the tumblr mentality
[3:55:17] <+DeaconBluesClues> @Faustgesicht no, it's been said on twitter but the people saying its ableist or classist are quoting a /pol/ copypasta, so its just 4chan trying to stir up shit
[3:55:22] <%toastybites> no it was an actual post on twitter going "touch grass is ableism"
[3:55:24] <%Dr_DangerPhD> if you look hard enough you can find one of any person
[3:55:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt To be fair pat if you can find any way to get offended over anything you found a person on twitter
[3:55:25] <%X2Eliah> There's a LOT of those people on reddit.
[3:55:28] <+senfood> That person isn't real. Just like Takeshi Miiike.
[3:55:28] <+ultimafullmetal> Pat is the Michael Jordan of Twitter arguments
[3:55:36] <FirewallStorm> the fake/ real guy
[3:55:36] <artoflec> There was a woman saying it was ableist because if she was 9 months pregnant she couldn't touch grass.
[3:55:40] <%alphonseisbest> I think Mr feel meet that person
[3:55:40] <dwhanson> If you think touching grass is classist you desperately need to touch grass.
[3:55:41] <rasamune> They're probably on Tumble getting laughed at by the few other people who are still on Tumblr
[3:55:44] <%WutangchickeN> lol what
[3:55:46] <+ApocalypticExpress> probs the type of person whod give this a 4/10
[3:55:50] <GoogleyGareth> Every shitty person you can imagine statistically exists somewhere in the world. And you should be mad about it.
[3:55:54] <+DeaconBluesClues> "raise traffick awareness - do death race"

[4:05:28] <%Romuken> astral chain
[4:05:29] <jtsoppy137> its true
[4:05:29] <+ScrapKingKeita> Nothing runs good, especially not Pokemon!
[4:05:29] <+dante_must_die_exe> that one racing game runs good on the switch
[4:05:30] <%deviljhojho_> well maybe rise?
[4:05:32] <ShudMirelurk> It wasn't made by GF so it runs well
[4:05:32] <+tigerfang86> FINALLY, NO MORE CAR CRASHES
[4:05:36] <KaiserMario> It's not blast processing
[4:05:37] <OkamiDude15> dont worry pat im sure the switch dock is burning like a mother right now
[4:05:38] <%Dementedpenguin> You're not wrong.
[4:05:39] <$spardanwarrior> MH Rise?
[4:05:42] <miucsa51> FAST
[4:05:43] <arcadianskypirate> No one can get hurt if you kill everyone
[4:05:43] <Tham1k> Nes games
[4:05:44] <AncyentMarinere> Akora
[4:05:48] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Astral Chain runs as well as you could possibly expect it to.
[4:05:49] <SaltyAzteca> thanks Kaneda Touchdown
[4:05:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Remember kids Drive safe or He will fucking KILL YOU
[4:05:55] <Saltmeisterr> SoR$
[4:05:59] <Saltmeisterr> 4*
[4:06:00] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> Astral Chain also made use of the framerate dimension tech
[4:06:13] <%RD_NX> :)
[4:06:16] <+tigerfang86> you saved CARS FOREVER
[4:06:16] <Zeppelee> Rise runs surprisingly well on the Switch.
[4:06:24] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Wasn't it DP2?
[4:06:24] <%alphonseisbest> what time u going till pat?
[4:06:26] <%Monkeyweed21> DEATH DRIVE MK II
[4:06:27] <FirewallStorm> by killing them all
[4:06:38] <miucsa51> did we tho?
[4:06:38] <TheFramedWarlock> Framerate dimension ?
[4:06:40] <BarnYardFiddler> I’m trying to remember if they covered both NMH games on the best friends
[4:06:44] <%Fooguwu> pretty sure it was DP1
[4:06:44] <artoflec> no it was astral chain because you literally go to another dimension for fights
[4:06:50] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> I think so
[4:06:50] <%Dementedpenguin> Deadly Premonition 2's framerate is a work of art.
[4:06:51] <+Nomenanza> nah first intance of framerate dimension was in Astral Chain
[4:06:54] <%DashXero> Sure. Why not?
[4:06:55] <%Dementedpenguin> Sure.
[4:06:55] <jtsoppy137> lets say yes
[4:06:56] <reddpop_> DP2 came out after astral chain tho
[4:06:56] <+Nomenanza> at least mentioned by you
[4:06:57] <MegalomaniacalMegalodon> I thought Deadly Premonition was where framerate goes to DIE not THRIVE
[4:07:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt DP2 was afterwards
[4:07:02] <Qsmash_> I thought Woolie did
[4:07:03] <%hatok> gigaboots and KZxcellent use it a lot
[4:07:05] <brachydios777> yes
[4:07:05] <%alphonseisbest> maybe
[4:07:08] <chaosjoey> I've never heard it before so probably original
[4:07:09] <artoflec> never heard it from anyone but Pat
[4:07:10] <%FaderPotater> oh yeah I forgot about that. I think astral chain is when I first started watching stuff on your archive channel
[4:07:11] <Madinki> Yeah sure fuck it
[4:07:11] <tanarath> Monster Hunter running perfect on the switch is great
[4:07:13] <zerointelligence000> You and woolie invent a lot of terms
[4:07:14] <%alphonseisbest> Jury's still out on that
[4:07:15] <%toastybites> you guys get slooters
[4:07:16] <%MelBrooksKA> You or Woolie
[4:07:25] <miucsa51> yeah sure why not
[4:07:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt NO i've heard "FrameRate Boss room" before
[4:07:29] <ErikFeral> *Ping Krimson

[4:30:59] <Arina_Beam> @toptieramisu surprisingly yeah, baki is at its worst rn yet I keep up with it.

[4:32:19] <%greasypete00> how is it even a fucking choice if you're gonna get married get the fucking house if you can
[4:32:19] <%DashXero> It sounds like the wedding planner is the problem.
[4:32:25] <vonmaultke> Nothing says we're in love like HUGE DEBT
[4:32:28] <+TheFlyingChurro> That's hilarious in a fucked up sort of way
[4:32:29] <Ner234> I'm learning WILD things about the Baki manga right now.

[4:32:47] <+tigerfang86> AAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:32:49] <+tigerfang86> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
[4:32:52] <$realm_forge> This show seems like the genesis of many many future divorces
[4:32:54] <+senfood> OH MY GOD
[4:32:56] <%MidnightBurst12> oh nooooooo
[4:32:57] <Dirtboar1> damn

[4:33:23] <Hydrapissed> they all died
[4:33:23] <+TopTieramisu> baki is more off the wall than jojo's. prove me wrong
[4:33:25] <+DeaconBluesClues> AMERICANS ARE STUPID
[4:33:27] <TongYueliang> The wedding industry's super fucked
[4:33:28] <Dirtboar1> thats so sad
[4:33:28] <tanarath> Holy shit
[4:33:29] <+senfood> AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY MILLENIALS DON'T GET MARRIED
[4:33:30] <+tigerfang86> that's SO AWFUL DAMN
[4:33:31] <sauceboss310> sugoiAwawa sugoiAwawa
[4:33:33] <Fro5tburn> NotLikeThis
[4:33:35] <brachydios777> What a bunch of idiots
[4:33:35] <+KennyKRool> It would be better to pay off 30k on a house then pay off the house early and have a 50k wedding when you are 45
[4:33:40] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> Oh man I'm engaged and my girlfriend and I are planning to literally not have a wedding I absolutely need to show her this
[4:33:43] <+condemned_15> I bet those dipshits signed off a contract that prevents them from suing
[4:33:47] <rasamune> Just HEARING about this makes me hurt
[4:33:47] <$OfficerMods> i think the main arguement the wedding planner uses is "well you can get a house anytime but only have ONE wedding"
[4:33:49] <follyofjolly> NotLikeThis holy fuck
[4:33:54] <Lancaster_H> spending that much on a wedding is fucking stupid to begin with
[4:33:58] <+tigerfang86> aww
[4:33:59] <linSP> weddings are so DUMB
[4:34:06] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt wait wait wait - does ANYONE pick house
[4:34:16] <+paladinstarbuster> Gay Pastor?
[4:34:18] <follyofjolly> See that makes sense
[4:34:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @ThatWeirdGuyFromWork your lucky my mah would suplex me if I didn't have a small ceromony
[4:34:21] <circular7> implies a wedding is equal to nothing Kappa
[4:34:22] <+tigerfang86> ok at least SOME people pick house
[4:34:23] <tanarath> House
[4:34:23] <%Taisuru> The house will pay for several wedding
[4:34:28] <%X2Eliah> Are the houses offered also a scam?
[4:34:29] <+vascillia> what mora quandry did i just walk into ? house ? huh?
[4:34:29] <Profmcstevie> Imagine being gay and a homeowner though, to own the church
[4:34:34] <justachap> A wedding, in this ecomony?
[4:34:37] <Arina_Beam> @toptieramisu idk I can tell you that kinnikuman is more bizarre than both of those series combined
[4:34:39] <+senfood> Get that house, have sex in it and have your wedding at Dave & Buster's. Done.
[4:34:40] <ohno778> That's what they get for choosing wedding. Weddings are easy. buying a house is difficult.
[4:34:41] <+KennyKRool> Pastor wants to make big statement by spending 30k on wedding instead of organizing a crowd funded charity to combat homeless in their local area with a 30k base?
[4:34:44] <+DeaconBluesClues> the only good things to spend money on are warhammer 40k minatures and the house to keep them in
[4:34:47] <+tigerfang86> OH SHIT
[4:34:49] <+Nomenanza> woooow
[4:34:51] <OkamiDude15> jesus christ

[4:34:59] <brachydios777> House first, then wedding
[4:35:00] <%FaderPotater> next fight you're going to get more death glove stuff.
[4:35:01] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> are you sure this isn't scripted
[4:35:03] <Fro5tburn> words on rock PogChamp

[4:35:09] <+dante_must_die_exe> what the actual fuck
[4:35:09] <Baljhet> why do people watch shows about Shitty People Being Shitty?
[4:35:09] <+tigerfang86> HUGE MANIPULATION
[4:35:11] <TongYueliang> Why...why was this okay?
[4:35:12] <%CalderGaming> who came up with and who greenlit this show
[4:35:12] <Zeif00> yikes
[4:35:15] <+tigerfang86> ABSOLUTELY HUGE
[4:35:19] <el_patronn64> eviiil
[4:35:24] <Ciglossonjr> Yo what the actual fuck
[4:35:25] <brachydios777> woooooow
[4:35:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> This sound so "unscripted"
[4:35:28] <%MelBrooksKA> This is so stupid
[4:35:31] <+DeaconBluesClues> @PatStaresAt please make this entire conversation into a youtube video by itself this shit owns
[4:35:32] <wendigo172> wtf
[4:35:34] <+senfood> This is what Netflix greenlit instead of S2 of Tuca and Bertie.
[4:35:39] <Ciglossonjr> This shit is why the fucking Great Flood happened
[4:35:41] <comedeity> oh god
[4:35:41] <+tigerfang86> OH GOD
[4:35:44] <+vascillia> what are they talking about!!!
[4:35:45] <+paladinstarbuster> YOOOOOOO
[4:35:45] <%whyskeywolfe> This is the most American thing I’ve ever heard of.
[4:35:45] <$realm_forge> This sounds like a show that would make me irrationally furious
[4:35:45] <artoflec> HAHAHA
[4:35:46] <scrumbotime> THAT'S JUST EVIL
[4:35:52] <follyofjolly> @CalderGaming Some scummy, balding entertainment mongrel
[4:35:52] <+Nomenanza> holy shit fuck those people
[4:35:52] <isolex_> THIS IS FUCKED
[4:35:54] <notsoy> if those fucking people broke that out on me, i would fucking Heat Action them all
[4:35:55] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> this sounds too insane to be unscripted
[4:35:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> also editing
[4:36:04] <brachydios777> oh my goooooooood!
[4:36:04] <+tigerfang86> the manipulation is SUPER REAL
[4:36:04] <%FaderPotater> God that has so much room to backfire.
[4:36:04] <boywunderkind> i have to watch this show
[4:36:07] <%Kyma1020> fuck man
[4:36:10] <+sphiraki> is it on netflix?
[4:36:18] <+condemned_15> as someone who worked in reality tv, producers only come up with scenarios and the talent is just manipulated to get genuine reactions
[4:36:22] <$OfficerMods> pyschopaths buisness majors ehhhh tomato toemato
[4:36:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> There are tons of people who don't have charisma paige.
[4:36:46] <+chiazam> That’s fucked
[4:36:47] <TongYueliang> How much information is given to these people? Cause it seems maybe like a bit too much intimate knowledge to have for the sake of business
[4:36:51] <+tigerfang86> Great Stream
[4:36:58] <Freeman0032> I remember MTV the real world first episode
[4:37:02] <OICW_Godhand> I keep thinking you mean Dwayne "the rock"
[4:37:04] <scrumbotime> "We've trapped your grandpa's soul in this rock that we've put in the fireplace, so now he is haunting the building"
[4:37:05] <+tigerfang86> big good stream
[4:37:07] <tanarath> Reality TV is just a way to get around unions.
[4:37:19] <+EternalInquisitor> "Your dad exploded in this house's basement, PLEASE buy this house"
[4:37:19] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> I would get violently angry, man
[4:37:20] <follyofjolly> I have to have hope that someone, at somepoint, is going to be sued for emotional damages at some point on there
[4:37:25] <+Mrbaconator> your dad was a working guy so here's a busted up house for you to fix
[4:37:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> I am one of those people without charaisma I got a face for radio and a voice for the newspapers
[4:37:43] <%FaderPotater> Talking about people trying and failing to be funny reminded me of my friend trying to be funny when we met Hannibal Burress in college and we all laughed AT him.
[4:37:55] <circular7> oof
[4:37:55] <linSP> is pat holding the black ps5 controller

[4:50:45] <%Taisuru> I dunno, food service was way worse than concessions for me, mileage may vary I suppose
[4:50:48] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> My first job was movie theater janitor and second was concessions.
[4:50:49] <%Puhff> Lots of food service doesnt get tips tho???
[4:50:50] <%X2Eliah> what what is "concessions"
[4:50:57] <%Puhff> Like, McDonalds doesnt get tips
[4:51:03] <%FaderPotater> I worked at a theater and the manager or owner would only hire girls for concession.
[4:51:06] <%Taisuru> @X2Eliah Movie theater food people
[4:51:07] <%ThatWeirdGuyFromWork> @X2Eliah who gives you candy at the theater
[4:51:17] <%FaderPotater> it was basically a policy.
