[0:18:16] <%tiaramaki> Nah
[0:18:16] <+Pendragwn> yes
[0:18:19] <%Ipsenscastle> 4:3 allows for borders with info and stuff
[0:18:20] <Kalcom> yes
[0:18:20] <%j0ustar> Nope
[0:18:20] <%Mister_McDerp> yes
[0:18:20] <theblackdolphin> nope!
[0:18:20] <%ElenaManetta> i don't even really need you
[0:18:21] <%discozombi> Absolutely
[0:18:22] <$afronooch> nah
[0:18:22] <%PanicSwytch> nah
[0:18:24] <%lutefiiisk> More RESI
[0:18:25] <CptVolkow> Pat is made 4:3
[0:18:25] <%Mariakko> nah
[0:18:26] <chiglit> "Human body"
[0:18:26] <%SummonerMagno> ... yes
[0:18:26] <%Nobrev> Yes
[0:18:27] <%ElenaManetta> in fact i would prefer a still image of a puppy
[0:18:30] <super_robo_mg> pat does fit perfectly in small things
[0:18:30] <%adventurerjess> just make it be your head in the box
[0:18:31] <%cowardman93> I turn on the stream and just see the funny ginger man just poking out the corner of his screen
[0:18:32] <%WhereIsWill> buy a 2 thousand dollar camera for no reason
[0:18:32] <+arancet> pat must be cubed
[0:18:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Yes, need big number camera for big boys
[0:18:33] <Kalcom> woolie does it
[0:18:33] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt But what if Elmo shows up?
[0:18:33] <Stygian_Wolf> so when you playing code veronica again Kappa @PatStaresAt
[0:18:34] <%crimsonharvest> honestly if i can see less of you so much the better
[0:18:34] <%SirGO0SE> Speaking of box I miss the Cube
[0:18:35] <%rumtumtugnutz> that's what she said
[0:18:35] <%Psyramics> You're fine now, but when Elmo is there, he is cut off
[0:18:35] <%Ipsenscastle> Cubes within cubes
[0:18:36] <%tiaramaki> No, the 4:3 is fine
[0:18:36] <+Javaa01> Pat is 4:3 sized
[0:18:39] <%j0ustar> It's fine
[0:18:41] <%Mr_Pylon> but then no baby
[0:18:42] <Ran196> but what if Paige is with you?
[0:18:44] <%crimsonharvest> well thats a bad joke sorry
[0:18:45] <cureneckbeard> Pat will need widescreen if he puts on more weight
[0:18:51] <%ElenaManetta> oh, elmo will find a way to be on camera
[0:18:51] <KaliasTV> What about thinscreen
[0:18:56] <%crimsonharvest> its impossible to hear the tone of it woops
[0:18:57] <%segonian> it does.
[0:18:59] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt my little pony and transformers crossover
[0:19:01] <%cowardman93> also elmo sits on the gamercuber to stare at strem
[0:19:01] <%Ipsenscastle> It's perfect because your body is 4:3 too
[0:19:04] <Kusanagi765> cubescreen
[0:19:07] <%AngriestAngryArtist> it's fine. Paige needs her hiding place during stream.
[0:19:09] <%crimsonharvest> ^^
[0:19:09] <%deadredeyez> psaDab_HF
[0:19:10] <synthiis> It's poutineweek, that's why he got all that weightt
[0:19:11] <%ElenaManetta> i want the stream to be in cinemascope
[0:19:13] <%segonian> just a perfect cube to hold the Pat is all we need.
[0:19:13] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> You should just edit out yourself and put a dinosaur down there
[0:19:17] <%cowardman93> elmo good boy
[0:19:17] <FrankysDream> do it for elmo
[0:19:25] <%valriot> @ipsenscastle LUL LUL
[0:19:31] <%crimsonharvest> the dugout protects you
[0:19:32] <cureneckbeard> Can we get like a separate camera box for Elmo, and Paige follows him around with camera, or some kind of elmo camera drone
[0:19:32] <%windsoc> valid

[0:34:32] <%Dragon_Batman> You trying to edit or find the Hook man screenshots?
[0:34:32] <OkamiDude15> The ultimate bio-ghost weapon
[0:34:35] <+necrocannibal2> it can be a bio-ghost
[0:34:40] <%Th3SmartAlec> just play it on screen
[0:34:45] <%majima666> the 'ghosts' leon were seeing was because he was infected
[0:34:47] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[0:34:49] <+FrostyAri> So has Pat talked about those RE8 rumors? havent been keeping up with the streams
[0:34:49] <%SMuffinMan> @necrocannibal2 Hookman was a hallucination after Leon gets infected
[0:34:50] <Oxybe> BioGhost?!?
[0:34:52] <+azure22900> Revelation 2 has ghosts, they're a bitch to deal with
[0:34:53] <CamiHeart> I got the last one!!!!! LuvSign
[0:34:56] <%SoaringLettuce> eh, hallucinations would work within the framework of BIOHORROR
[0:34:59] <%derekwst3> @PatStaresAt its purple

[0:35:06] <Cwb311> @bionoidlcr I don’t see a time at all. Maybe cuz I’m on my phone?
[0:35:08] <%thegreatbambe> ew

[0:35:32] <%Kegeto> ooooh
[0:35:34] <CamiHeart> I watched other people play it. lol
[0:35:34] <%michingmallecho> Oh shit
[0:35:39] <+azure22900> Revelation 2 had purely invisible enemies that were impossilbe to see without the girl
[0:35:40] <deviljhojho_> makes me think
[0:35:41] <%coreyyotto> damn
[0:35:44] <+ItsYaGirlMaria> oh god its all coming together
[0:35:45] <%SWFanatic> whats a ruvik
[0:35:48] <%valriot> What a awful game
[0:35:49] <MSN04_Sazabi> HOOKMAN WITHIN
[0:35:51] <%majima666> still yet to play either evil within or the sequel. want to pick them up as they are cheap as chips nowadays
[0:35:53] <+rascalrebel> @azure22900 ah thanks
[0:35:53] <TechDragon_Z> Didn't he make Vanquish first
[0:35:56] <%HyperBomb21> hookman would be a better fir for Evil Within than RE tbh
[0:35:57] <Krisaeron> Pat has a Hookam Fetish
[0:35:58] <%windsoc> ruviks cube?
[0:36:02] <%Dragon_Batman> I
[0:36:02] <+necrocannibal2> that was the best part of Evil Within, too
[0:36:10] <%Dragon_Batman> I'd believe it
[0:36:13] <biomegabear> does evil within suck?
[0:36:16] <%rytisone> EW2 also has blue screens and it's good
[0:36:17] <%HyperBomb21> no
[0:36:17] <fairore> probably 2
[0:36:18] <+necrocannibal2> the first one yeah
[0:36:20] <%ElenaManetta> But whats much different from Ruvick vs. Clocktower Killer
[0:36:20] <%Beough> god the first evil within is so forgettable, only for the second one to be actually shockingly enjoyable and really good.
[0:36:20] <%BionoidLCR> @Cwb311 .......if you look at the top of your phone.....or any clock around you theres these numbers that tell you what time it is and if pats streams star around 3 and its 3:30 pm est that would mean?
[0:36:22] <JeighmesTV> check out the big brain on pat
[0:36:22] <%HyperBomb21> EW1 is really fun
[0:36:22] <%ShichiNoBushi> You're Pat.
[0:36:25] <%alcors_wisdom> evil within remake when
[0:36:25] <%nofestu2> big brain
[0:36:26] <%GarbageNirvana> No one came to see Mikami's hook
[0:36:26] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig OWL2019200iq
[0:36:27] <+necrocannibal2> EW2 is great
[0:36:33] <%JD_Lars> apatBig brain
[0:36:35] <%coreyyotto> The first half of EW1 is like god tier survival horror. It's just the second half where everything goes to shit
[0:36:36] <deviljhojho_> good name
[0:36:36] <%HyperBomb21> EW1 was not good on launch but it got better
[0:36:51] <%valriot> doodWAT
[0:36:54] <%SoaringLettuce> the screen turning blue and announcing that you shouldnt use ammo doesnt sound like a good mechanic
[0:36:57] <%skeletor42069> pat is shortstack like midna
[0:36:58] <biomegabear> Whats wrong with Evil Within @PatStaresAt
[0:37:02] <lindy94> BabyRage
[0:37:04] <+tsatoma> Never played any of the EW series, but they seemed to have interesting ideas.
[0:37:05] <%TheMattman1313> @PatStaresAt Yeah pretty much
[0:37:05] <fairore> huh
[0:37:09] <%FacetiousAF> "Do drugs to live long" - that guy's doctor
[0:37:10] <%valriot> A lot
[0:37:10] <Oxybe> Clock drugs
[0:37:10] <%nofestu2> use drugs to reclaim grey health
[0:37:11] <goddamndavid> Pat, my mom says i cant watch someone who does weed
[0:37:11] <%rytisone> watch the LP
[0:37:14] <%Jekado> LETTERBOXED!
[0:37:16] <%coreyyotto> cursed even
[0:37:18] <%Beough> god the first evil within is so forgettable, only for the second one to be actually shockingly enjoyable and really good.
[0:37:19] <%majima666> whats the ps4 version like?
[0:37:20] <%peachy996> Exscuse me
[0:37:20] <%Dragon_Batman> It's a decent game, should have been way better
[0:37:25] <%ElenaManetta> Color palette ruins the environments
[0:37:29] <%HyperBomb21> lol
[0:37:30] <%peachy996> Excuse me/10
[0:37:31] <%AnIrishPapaya> AnIrishPapaya subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Hello Pat. I just stared at the supercut of the 1997/2012 Berserk for 8 hours on youtube. Holy shit that was a masterpiece to watch. If only skull knight showed up just a liiiiiittle bit earlier.
[0:37:34] <%weeaburger> Just wanted to let Pat know i once did an Re 2 review for a grade in 7th grade and one of my key points was the godlike ZAPPING SYSTEM Cheer100
[0:37:35] <JeighmesTV> theres whole compilations of pat screaming about the letterboxing in EW1
[0:37:39] <deviljhojho_> evil within 2 was done dirty tbh
[0:37:41] <%GarbageNirvana> someone tried to make a triple a game on a shoestring budget basically
[0:37:46] <deviljhojho_> poor son of a bitch never stood a chance
[0:37:46] <Krisaeron> Hey Pat, what do you think about Dino Crisis games or Alone in The Dark 1?
[0:37:49] <OkamiDude15> The letterboxing within
[0:37:50] <artoflec> well at least theres no letterboxing and it runs fine now on pc
[0:37:50] <Fluxraw> Have u played The Evil Within in First Person Mode ?
[0:37:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> smrt
[0:37:55] <segbas2004> the letterboxing thing was such a dumb thing for the PC version
[0:37:55] <%HyperBomb21> I think EW2 sucked but whatever. EW1 is stillr eally fun
[0:37:57] <%happyface699> Agreed I hated the ending of 1
[0:37:59] <%solidousstream> Hey @patstaresat how does it feel to be on a normal sleeping schedule?
[0:38:01] <cureneckbeard> Don't let it set in!
[0:38:03] <%SwagglesMD> psaSmug psaBougie
[0:38:06] <%ElenaManetta> There are a ton, ton, ton of people who say Evil Within 2 "ruined" Evil Within and that's why EW2 got low sales and it makes me sad
[0:38:11] <%nofestu2> that would be fun
[0:38:16] <%FacetiousAF> randomizers don't seem like a pat thing
[0:38:21] <%ElenaManetta> EW2 is shockingly divided among people
[0:38:21] <%Psyramics> Then he can't play it the same way he's played it 100 times before
[0:38:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> That's okay Pat, I'm a coward too
[0:38:25] <%michingmallecho> Evil within 2 is piss easy and the enemies are way too dumb. Hopefully evil within 3 will fix all the mistakes apatSmug apatSmug
[0:38:31] <%valriot> CLANG
[0:38:33] <cureneckbeard> I bet randomizers give Pat anxiety
[0:38:34] <%Th3SmartAlec> oof
[0:38:37] <%Dragon_Batman> He does do the same thing over and over when he replays so I can see it
[0:38:40] <%HyperBomb21> Actually, wether or not EW 1 oe 2 is better depends on what your eally want from a actioon horror game
[0:38:42] <the_first_hassan> hey pat have you heard the yakuza 7 main theme its great
[0:38:43] <xxHungryxx> i never played any Evil Within games. Just didnt want to play them
[0:38:44] <%valriot> Yeah I know
[0:38:48] <%valriot> But also CLANG
[0:38:52] <Cwb311> @bionoidlcr I thought you may have meant like a timer that showed how long the stream had been going. I gotcha though. Just started.
[0:38:52] <+necrocannibal2> CLANG
[0:38:56] <%Ipsenscastle> I don't get Evil Within stans, the game has nothing particularly unique about it
[0:38:58] <%windsoc> i tried so hard to like the anime
[0:38:59] <JeighmesTV> how bout that monster girl with the big honkin hands
[0:38:59] <%alcors_wisdom> are you up to date pat?

[0:39:08] <%nofestu2> ADA
[0:39:09] <+tsatoma> A duh?
[0:39:13] <%SwagglesMD> I think EW2 was a better game cuz it was it's own thing instead of trying to be RE4 like EW1
[0:39:13] <%solidousstream> BIG OFF
[0:39:13] <%valriot> They did Schnozer justice tho. Young Nose Boi
[0:39:15] <%HyperBomb21> ResidentSleeper

[0:39:31] <Cwb311> Looking forward to some RE4 action
[0:39:33] <MSN04_Sazabi> "Enemies are way too dumb" enemies have been dumb for years. In fact, they haven't been smart since FEAR. The first one that is.

[0:39:39] <%lutefiiisk> black
[0:39:39] <%davimotion96> Skull knight is a piece of shit, he let the Eclipse go down just to have a shot at killing the God Hand, instead of warning or protecting Guts and the rest.
[0:39:40] <%Aydarkzero> black screen btw
[0:39:40] <Ran196> Screen is black
[0:39:42] <%flyingkensai> Hey Pat, just finished SDC for Jojo's, but is anything more hype than pillar men theme?

[0:39:44] <%peachy996> Pat
[0:39:45] <%rytisone> Darkness
[0:39:47] <xxHungryxx> Darkness
[0:39:49] <DatAsuna> @SwagglesMD yeah, though EW1 was also trying to be a stealth game/crafting and trap game as well as RE4
[0:39:51] <artoflec> No Game, Friend
[0:39:53] <cureneckbeard> Perfectly calibrated
[0:39:55] <%michingmallecho> Oh shit, I remembered the Yakuza 3-5 physical collection comes out Tuesday. WOOOOOOOOOO
[0:39:55] <mMayrro> man pat sure stares at this
[0:39:55] <Krisaeron> ALONE IN THE DARK
[0:39:55] <%peachy996> Imprisoning me
[0:39:56] <+necrocannibal2> "please don't be black"
[0:39:57] <%theKingRamses> IMPRISONING ME
[0:39:59] <%Aydarkzero> nailed it

[0:40:11] <Captain_Joe1911> carciSmug Best Ada costume
[0:40:18] <TechDragon_Z> Ass Ada
[0:40:18] <%Jekado> that opening menu
[0:40:21] <%ElenaManetta> oh my goodness it looks like an arcade shooter
[0:40:21] <Glass_Muffin> @patstaresat how did you like my cursed fan art
[0:40:22] <%Aydarkzero> Assignment Ada ResidentSleeper
[0:40:23] <%happyface699> @michingmallecho I already bought the digital but I’m gonna get the physical too
[0:40:24] <%majima666> so its seperate ways with the super shitty cutscenes
[0:40:25] <%ElenaManetta> that title splash screen
[0:40:28] <Kostas1001> @PatStaresAt there were a total of 2 Berserk chapters in 2019
[0:40:29] <%majima666> quality wise
[0:40:29] <%alcors_wisdom> guts is a dime a dozen bitch why would skullknight jeopardize saving the world over his one armed ass
[0:40:31] <%peachy996> This mode makes no sense plot wise but still fun
[0:40:32] <+Diabetic> Though we touched and went our SEPARATE WAYS!
[0:40:33] <mMayrro> she looks like becky in that title screen
[0:40:33] <Krisaeron> Ara~ARA~ Leon-Kun!~
[0:40:35] <%SwagglesMD> @DatAsuna EW1 was a giant mess imo and the DLC didn't really help it try to be it's own thing but Executioner was fantastic tho
[0:40:36] <+necrocannibal2> she looks cool in that
[0:40:42] <%zamzoph> Where's the red dress? FeelsBadMan
[0:40:43] <%Th3SmartAlec> This sounds like a pardoy of Wesker
[0:40:44] <the_first_hassan> hey pat have you heard the yakuza 7 main theme its great

[0:40:52] <%thegreatbambe> Man Ada is one evil bitch huh?
[0:40:53] <xxHungryxx> So...did Leon ever sleep with Ada?
[0:40:55] <%happyface699> So hot
[0:40:56] <%Vikken141> This is pretty non-cannon now, after separate ways
[0:40:57] <%Aydarkzero> this totally didn't happen
[0:40:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its a mimigame Pat
[0:41:00] <%zenraider> zenraider subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months, currently on a 7 month streak!

[0:41:17] <DatAsuna> @SwagglesMD agreed,however I do still LOVE the shot where sebastian falls down the tunnel and it turns and he falls onto the floor
[0:41:18] <mMayrro> ouchie ouch
[0:41:19] <%Nobrev> @Kostas1001 miura will die in front of an idol master game before he finishes berserk
[0:41:20] <%SWFanatic> LEON! Heeelp.

[0:41:24] <madskull456> Thanks for the LuvCool @zenraider
[0:41:24] <%JJCheeker> I mean I'm glad they added it to the game because it's fun
[0:41:24] <RagingLeo> pat you DEFINITELY are a "mini" game Kappa

[0:41:28] <%arsonistdaria> pat's just mini
[0:41:28] <cureneckbeard> pat short
[0:41:29] <%ElenaManetta> There's some fancy video game term for when the gameplay is separated from the story and I can't remember it.
[0:41:29] <goddamndavid> if it didnt happen then why was it made?
[0:41:34] <cureneckbeard> ret-con city
[0:41:34] <%Beough> WHO EVEN PAYS ATTENTION TO RESIDENT EVIL CANON? CAPCOM SURE DOESN'T
[0:41:35] <%HyperBomb21> This is my favorite ADA outfit, ngl. I like this SWAT look
[0:41:36] <%JJCheeker> It's pretty much a challenge mode
[0:41:36] <%ElenaManetta> Something journalists love to use.
[0:41:39] <%ospreyworks> Didn’t she stab Leon when he choked her?
[0:41:39] <+necrocannibal2> she could punish me
[0:41:42] <%logoth_> Where's her dress, what the fuckkkk
[0:41:45] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt If she didn't have a knife what did she stab Leon with when he was choking her?
[0:41:47] <%Aydarkzero> shame this costume wasn't used anywhere else

[0:49:09] <CureMode666> Speed run
[0:49:10] <nautilaa> her running animation is so stupid
[0:49:10] <Krisaeron> The New and Improved Resident Evil 4 Re-Master Warmastered Edition now featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry series in HD!
[0:49:15] <%zamzoph> the red dress?
[0:49:18] <SomersaultJustice> or the other kick
[0:49:18] <%Cervantas> is this the zapping system?

[0:50:43] <%Sir_stride> @beough yup you can see him from time to time
[0:50:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS FIIIINE
[0:50:47] <biomegabear> But you can see him
[0:50:48] <%emperordread> This whole bonus mission running in paralllel to the main story reminds me of Metal Gear Sigint from MGS3
[0:50:48] <CursedNobleman> or hear the other gunshots? LUL
[0:50:48] <@commanderclaw> Wouldn't they hear the sound of gunfire?
[0:50:48] <%Psych_man13_13> So if we're doing side stuff, then that means beating tofu in REmake 2, right?
[0:50:50] <%SirGO0SE> he needs to go to the eye doctor
[0:50:52] <%SoFarFetched> OR HEAR HER GUN GO OFF AT ALL DURING THIS
[0:50:53] <%rytisone> But Ada can notice him
[0:50:57] <nautilaa> @SirGO0SE don't worry man i still think she's hot, it's just she runs stupidly
[0:50:57] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt If she didn't have a knife what did she stab Leon with when he was choking her?

[0:51:01] <MayorRev> Imagine if Leon was your recorded gameplay and you could see leon do all the mistakes you made
[0:51:04] <TechDragon_Z> She stabs Leon with a knife in the main story
[0:51:05] <%HyperBomb21> shhh its fiiiine
[0:51:05] <%michingmallecho> just barely missed a giant red dress
[0:51:06] <%zamzoph> @PatStaresAt she stabbed Leon when he was choking her
[0:51:06] <evbites> well leon is a bit of a dumbass

[0:51:08] <%hntronium> Don't think about it too hard
[0:51:09] <%suikudo> Its on her leg isnt it?
[0:51:10] <%HyperBomb21> dont think about it
[0:51:10] <@JustinianKnight> shoulda been just a karate shop animation
[0:51:10] <+necrocannibal2> @Dragovus was gonna ask that
[0:51:10] <Ran196> she stabbed Leon that one time
[0:51:11] <%peachy996> It's the Knife she uses when Leon chokes her out
[0:51:15] <%SWFanatic> I like the little cat bark the ganados do
[0:51:16] <%Zebroneath> She has a knife she stabs Leon with
[0:51:17] <thetruenicster> Didn't she stab Leon with a knife when he was choking her in the main game?
[0:51:17] <%SWFanatic> its cute
[0:51:18] <%shurtal> doesn't she stab leon in the leg near the end of a game with her knife?
[0:51:18] <@JustinianKnight> chop* even
[0:51:18] <%alcors_wisdom> havent you heard the saying "a woman never travels alone"
[0:51:19] <%arsonistdaria> pat no one ever said she doesn't have a knife
[0:51:19] <%JJCheeker> Or I mean not zombies
[0:51:20] <%GarbageNirvana> Player control generates a knife out of her flesh
[0:51:20] <%bluebiscuit94> It's an imaginary knife
[0:51:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Why do you say she doesnt have a knife? @PatStaresAt
[0:51:22] <%HyperBomb21> dont let it set in
[0:51:24] <%ha2ken> She clearly stabbed Evil Leon tho
[0:51:29] <%GarbageNirvana> She's like a Warframe
[0:51:30] <%SoaringLettuce> she stabs leon in the thigh, re fan
[0:51:32] <%suikudo> Im pretty sure she keeps the knife on her leg @PatStaresAt
[0:51:33] <SomersaultJustice> and she fixes all the stuff she breaks
[0:51:34] <%JonnyFodder> Ada had a knife, what do you think she stabbed Leon with when he lost control?
[0:51:34] <%Chatterbox1991> @PatStaresAt she has a knife in RE4, she uses it to stab leon when the plagas makes leon attack her

[1:01:16] <%windsoc> problems mostly
[1:01:17] <%chambatron> He doesn't use Streamer mode because of the same reason he won't play Dead Space on PS3. He can't be bothered LUL
[1:01:18] <%solidousstream> PLAY RE6 YOU COWARD!!!

[1:01:48] <%solidousstream> psaCaw
[1:01:52] <%cowardman93> perhaps tried too hard
[1:01:53] <seniortrump> poor one bird
[1:01:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Birds must be punished for their arrogance
[1:01:58] <+Remery_> Can Ada Suplex?
[1:01:58] <CursedNobleman> cut em in the nuts LUL
[1:02:04] <+necrocannibal2> I remember her having a butterfly kick, where she flipped backwards. am I correct or going crazy?
[1:02:09] <%cowardman93> how is Pat killing the birds if birds are not real?
[1:02:18] <%arsonistdaria> lol the treasure he missed was totally the mask wasn't it
[1:02:26] <dan_g_v> He told "Detrad de tí" which means, "Behind you"
[1:02:31] <SweepTheLegoMyEggo> they keep yelling "behind you stupid"
[1:02:33] <%ElenaManetta> fuck i hate that female zombie noise every sigle time
[1:02:36] <%FacetiousAF> chat is pat already done with the base game then?

[1:02:46] <+necrocannibal2> @FacetiousAF yes

[1:02:48] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Nice!
[1:02:50] <%ElenaManetta> NICE MIDAIR
[1:02:56] <dan_g_v> They didn't call him "stupid", they call him "imbecile"
[1:02:58] <%natebud> That back kick feels kind of weak somehow
[1:02:58] <%Dragovus> Pat kicked that woman. Paige would be proud.
[1:02:59] <OkamiDude15> @elenamanetta not a fan of the cougar sound effect? nkoLUL
[1:03:00] <%ElenaManetta> im surprised pat didnt start complimenting himself after that
[1:03:00] <SlimeSlimeSlime> That's what we call a pro gamer move.

[1:04:05] <dan_g_v> Ada's black dress is my favorite. Love the pants
[1:04:07] <%peachy996> If she loves Leon so much why no bang
[1:04:16] <dan_g_v> Ada and Leon did Bang
[1:04:20] <%natebud> Shouldn't it be "cojela" now since they're talking about Ada?
[1:04:22] <+donpatrondx> local sport
[1:04:24] <%SWFanatic> they graduated from axe throw U
[1:04:27] <%rytisone> someone with a punisher hat must have trained them

[1:08:26] <OkamiDude15> @dan_g_v he jumped off into the void
[1:08:27] <%joylent_blue> dan_g_v the zombo voluntarily jumped off the bridge before pat could shoot him

[1:08:31] <%rytisone> goodbye money
[1:08:36] <%peachy996> She had money
[1:08:38] <dan_g_v> oh, that sounds nice XD
[1:08:50] <%j0ustar> No money for Pat
[1:08:50] <%linSP> how long is this mode i just finished the base game yesterday
[1:08:50] <OkamiDude15> @necrocannibal2 the bella twins/sisters I think
[1:08:52] <%thelardwind> Yeet that money
[1:08:54] <%natebud> of course
[1:08:56] <dan_g_v> seriously, why isn't Pat's youtube channel full of highlights?
[1:09:02] <CamiHeart> She took that money to the grave
[1:09:02] <%peachy996> Chainsaw Girl has money
[1:09:04] <%unclekulikov> yeah, bro. You shot the chainsaw off the cliff
[1:09:04] <Ran196> yes
[1:09:11] <+Zombiemowlcher> Reset
[1:09:11] <dan_g_v> ... is somebody compiling Pat's highlights in the tubes?
[1:09:12] <%windsoc> do you ever find the cat whats missing its eye?
[1:09:13] <DatAsuna> @dan_g_v cause then pat would have to edit
[1:09:15] <Ran196> Chainsaw peeps always ahve delicious money
[1:09:17] <%j0ustar> Goodbye 10000 pesetas
[1:09:18] <%natebud> Probably not much since it's early game
[1:09:18] <%arsonistdaria> the lost money thing happens like every fucking time
[1:09:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @dan_g_v You can check mine. I make Pat Higlights
[1:09:27] <%joylent_blue> compilations
[1:09:27] <%SirGO0SE> the whole stream is the highlight
[1:09:29] <%rytisone> cause that's work
[1:09:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FANS MAKE IGHLIGHTS
[1:09:31] <%SoFarFetched> Like highlights from streams.
[1:09:32] <%emperordread> You're thinking of it wrong chat, pat just paid to make the chainsaw lady problem go away
[1:09:34] <%Dragon_Batman> That would take editing
[1:09:35] <%Psych_man13_13> like clips
[1:09:36] <+TheWarpJump> Like what max does
[1:09:37] <%FacetiousAF> like... just the clips?
[1:09:38] <TheMirai> he's asking "why don't you edit" and the answer is "because I don't want to"
[1:09:40] <JetpackMcQuack> work bad
[1:09:41] <Ahk_90> Because editing is a loooooong ass process
[1:09:42] <biomegabear> compilations probably
[1:09:42] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Compilations like Max coes
[1:09:45] <+TheWarpJump> true
[1:09:46] <dan_g_v> like the dog jpg
[1:09:48] <AllTheZibas> ALL 5 PogChamp
[1:09:50] <Texascourierlive> Bro ada is swole
[1:09:55] <%FacetiousAF> just look in the comments for timestamps Jebaited
[1:09:55] <+necrocannibal2> hire someone
[1:09:57] <%valriot> Max has an editor
[1:10:00] <%chambatron> Max is not even editing all of them anymore
[1:10:02] <%Psych_man13_13> editing makes pats pp go down
[1:10:04] <%Dragon_Batman> And Max doesn't do all of them some one else does
[1:10:05] <%michingmallecho> Max pays people@
[1:10:07] <+TheWarpJump> Max has an editor now
[1:10:09] <%joylent_blue> if nothing else, just go through all the most popular recent clips
[1:10:10] <dan_g_v> it's been ages, but couldn't you import highlights from twitch to tubes?
[1:10:14] <%SoFarFetched> @dan_g_v That's usually the work of other people making the clips LUL pat wants to do little work as possible
[1:10:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The Fans (like me and Mysterious Jojo) make compilations so its fine
[1:10:16] <%Ganerumo> He started hiring editors already
[1:10:16] <OkamiDude15> Max pays others to edit
[1:10:19] <+TheWarpJump> but he has edited the stuff himself
[1:10:23] <%Dragon_Batman> No he has some people edit like Hawke and others
[1:10:24] <%ha2ken> Pat just uploads VODs really.
[1:10:24] <babo____> he has one now
[1:10:25] <%chambatron> He already has one and is helping but not for all of his vids
[1:10:26] <+necrocannibal2> nice
[1:10:27] <%rytisone> make Paige eit Kappa
[1:10:27] <%GarbageNirvana> That was his end of year retrospective
[1:10:29] <%XeroSigmaPrime> He already has one, but he does like 80% of the editing still
[1:10:34] <%rytisone> *edit
[1:10:35] <%RPG_CHICAGO> Max also has The Hawke which he'll pay on occasion
[1:10:36] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt pay paige
[1:10:41] <%realm_forge> Did pat beat the main campaign already?
[1:10:43] <%valriot> Max, for real the hardest working streamer
[1:10:44] <+TheWarpJump> He would stream until like 5 am and then edit untill like 8 am
[1:10:47] <%Dragon_Batman> The Hype and RAges were never him I believe
[1:10:49] <cureneckbeard> crazy talk
[1:10:49] <%joylent_blue> yeah realm_forge
[1:10:52] <MSN04_Sazabi> Paypaige
[1:10:55] <%ha2ken> Pay Elmo
[1:10:55] <%bread_assassin> Pay her in DICK.
[1:10:56] <%Th3SmartAlec> Pay her in... favors
[1:10:56] <%chambatron> He said he would edit the videos after finishing streaming around 4 AM and sleep around 12 PM
[1:10:57] <+TheWarpJump> TBH i have no clue how he did that sht

[1:11:02] <DatAsuna> Paige? You mean BeachSaliva
[1:11:02] <%SirGO0SE> if you employ Paige, you can give her a uniform KappaHD
[1:11:05] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Max puts so much production in his streams, its beautiful
[1:11:06] <seniortrump> MUSIC
[1:11:08] <%Ventris666> Ventris666 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:11:11] <%GarbageNirvana> But yeah don't try to do everything yourself in any endeavor, you'll burn out way too quick

[1:11:31] <mMayrro> I wonder how Leon's doing...
[1:11:32] <OkamiDude15> I remember bluenoises and hawke would do some editing work for him a while back
[1:11:35] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This is the Del Lago music?!
[1:11:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Elmo can probably figure out video editing
[1:11:39] <Huntercd> Elmo is too expensive
[1:11:39] <%peachy996> Ada handing out Fan Kicks like Candy
[1:11:45] <CamiHeart> Wow, Leon has been fighting for a long time.
[1:11:46] <%Valdorick> Shooty kick bangs
[1:11:48] <%arsonistdaria> Hey pat remember that treasure chat totally lied about you getting later when you backtrack

[1:12:22] <MSN04_Sazabi> Ada is her own enemy
[1:12:25] <CamiHeart> He's the one playing the music
[1:12:26] <OkamiDude15> Tony hawk is schrodingers celebrity
[1:12:28] <dan_g_v> puzzles are very scary indeed
[1:12:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead psaCrazy
[1:12:29] <+theobble> @MSN04_Sazabi my favorite parts are when he says "wow" after doing the same combo PogChamp
[1:12:31] <%Faustgesicht> Just me or are there a lot more female zombies in ada's run?
[1:12:37] <%rytisone> it's Chris
[1:12:40] <WhereDoYouThinkWeAre> how come ada never gets her own game
[1:12:40] <%SMuffinMan> Remember the final boss of this campaign? It's stupid
[1:12:41] <%worldbrand> is combat encounter music playing for fakesies a good thing or a bad thing in a horror game?
[1:12:46] <%ha2ken> I feel like Ada would wear the pants in a relationship.
[1:12:52] <Kristoffers> hm
[1:12:58] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SMuffinMan WHAt?! That fight was cool
[1:13:04] <%SoaringLettuce> if adas game is gonna be faster paced, she should hookshot up ladders
[1:13:05] <seniortrump> they are so close to each other
[1:13:19] <%natebud> editing takes forever
[1:13:20] <daemos123> hey pat, would you like a 4 remake in the classic game style? fixed camera, tank controls, the works?
[1:13:20] <ChrisM341> Pay them in exposure Kappa Kappa
[1:13:22] <%SoFarFetched> makes sense
[1:13:23] <DatAsuna> I edit, can attest
[1:13:23] <+TheWarpJump> yeah they have to watch through all the streams pick out momments
[1:13:25] <+TheWarpJump> its hard
[1:13:27] <%chambatron> Serious questions? @PatStaresAt Don't you think they would get demonetized?
[1:13:29] <%rytisone> you wanna see the best of? just watch parts where Paige is in
[1:13:29] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[1:13:30] <%crimsonharvest> exposure kills
[1:13:31] <%SilvaChariot0133> LUL
[1:13:32] <%Faustgesicht> @ha2ken there's an entire cute comic series about that with her and leon
[1:13:33] <@commanderclaw> It's not worth the cost benefit analysis
[1:13:34] <%unclekulikov> I can see that.
[1:13:34] <%dirtyh4rr1> LUL
[1:13:36] <%emperordread> offer college credit
[1:13:36] <Roz_Lynd> well i mean i help shy and help you two nerds
[1:13:38] <SomersaultJustice> he means expose yourself to them as payment
[1:13:41] <AllTheZibas> EXPOSURE BUCKS
[1:13:41] <biomegabear> People already make comps on your videos
[1:13:44] <%theAncopro> pay them in emerald
[1:13:47] <%SMuffinMan> @xerosigmaprime it's buggy as fuck, you can get stun locked in a corner. Also it's stupid.
[1:13:47] <%Nope80808> have them pay you for exposure.
[1:13:48] <+TheWarpJump> You could do like your top clips of the week not to hard to edit
[1:13:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Pay them by exposing yourself to them :)
[1:13:48] <%Gogogolem> Hire Paige and Pay her in Macdonalds.
[1:13:48] <DatAsuna> tho you could be lazy and just grab the bits people clip for you and throw them together. lol
[1:13:49] <seniortrump> pat is good
[1:13:50] <s_snowball> make them do it for exposure
[1:13:50] <Ran196> Free the children on Epstien's island
[1:13:53] <%RPG_CHICAGO> BUT YOU'LL GET KNOWN AND MAKE MORE MONEY LATER
[1:13:54] <abakkus> pat is the anti-scumbag
[1:13:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> And besides several fans already make Pat comps for free
[1:13:54] <Roz_Lynd> who's to say someone else wouldn't wanna help you the same way?
[1:13:55] <%joylent_blue> basically if you want a compilation just go through the most recent popular clips tab here on twitch
[1:13:55] <cureneckbeard> pat good
[1:13:56] <%peachy996> Alright Pat, can you redeem youself here
[1:13:56] <Jeemukun> pat's a jerk not a monster
[1:13:57] <%bread_assassin> Only villains do that.
[1:13:57] <%optimasmaximas> if you want clips thats what solidus and mysteriousjojo are for
[1:13:58] <CamiHeart> Lights, cameras, action!
[1:13:58] <JeighmesTV> "paying with exposure" is like how parent's allowance is "i feed you and house you"
[1:13:59] <%arsonistdaria> pay them in bones from paige's bone closet
[1:13:59] <%Th3SmartAlec> TIME PARADOX
[1:14:01] <Huntercd> Exposure bucks
[1:14:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> you could pay them by showing them The Manticore.
[1:14:01] <%ShichiNoBushi> Villians do that.
[1:14:02] <%Rngiddion> pat is the subject of enough reddit posts already guys
[1:14:02] <evbites> pay them in elmo fur
[1:14:05] <%rytisone> it's upside down tho
[1:14:05] <%realm_forge> YOU CANT BUY FOOD WITH EXPOSURE FUCK OFF
[1:14:07] <%ha2ken> @Faustgesicht Yeah. I've seen some of those.
[1:14:08] <Zaphire_Saucypants> she sets it up for Leon
[1:14:09] <%ospreyworks> Pat not Kratos confirmed
[1:14:09] <+necrocannibal2> this a time paradox
[1:14:10] <%SoFarFetched> Its upside down for this one
[1:14:11] <%SoaringLettuce> its upside down
[1:14:12] <OkamiDude15> Only villains do that
[1:14:14] <cureneckbeard> People die of exposure
[1:14:14] <Zaphire_Saucypants> changes the position
[1:14:15] <%SWFanatic> So Pat's alignment is true good or chaotic good?
[1:14:16] <+dezimaly> people who pay in exposure are a special king of shitt heels
[1:14:17] <seniortrump> ew
[1:14:19] <%Ipsenscastle> Edited YouTube videos seem like way less of a good investment than Twitch anyway
[1:14:20] <dan_g_v> I thought you could export clips from your twitch to youtube, or at least that was in the past
[1:14:23] <mMayrro> Pat stares but he does not see

[1:14:35] <%rytisone> Paige is smarter
[1:14:36] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt The symbol is upside down from when Leon does it
[1:14:36] <seniortrump> AMAZING
[1:14:36] <%SoaringLettuce> pat is chaotic, we know that much
[1:14:37] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @SMuffinMan Really? I never experienced any long lasting bugs. Saddler sometimes gets stuck with his dash, but his dash also lets him escape any of those clipping.

[1:14:49] <%PanicSwytch> Don't be cheap If u receive good service
[1:14:50] <xxHungryxx> Exposure sounds like the title of a horror game
[1:14:51] <%linSP> PAIGE IS THE NEW PUZZLE MASTET
[1:14:51] <+Caidezes> WORSE THAN PAIGE
[1:14:53] <%happyface699> 1 TRY

[1:36:49] <dan_g_v> wait, really? First time I hear that. Are there other "manual" difficulty changers in the game? Do they punish you if you shot the doggies too?
[1:36:50] <%SirGO0SE> 1 pat 2 cup?
[1:36:52] <%flyingkensai> Oh fuck we're already too late then

[1:37:06] <cureneckbeard> Kill a cow, kill a cow, kill a cow, ayy. You're mining, you are Notch's son
[1:37:08] <%SoFarFetched> Cause plot
[1:37:09] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You just killed Plague of Gripes
[1:37:10] <%Valdorick> Because its his name.
[1:37:10] <+machshop> because they don't have a word for Lord Saddler in spanish
[1:37:10] <MSN04_Sazabi> Don Saddler
[1:37:11] <%Ipsenscastle> All Pat's highlights would just be variations on this hilarious poop on face joke
[1:37:11] <Thalchampz> because histitle is english
[1:37:12] <willtheprofessional> @ElenaManetta the game has adaptive difficulty. if you go too long without dying, the game gets harder and vice versa. Killing the animals puts the difficulty up, i believe.
[1:37:14] <%umbypokochan> his first name is Lord
[1:37:14] <%ElenaManetta> "i can say random shit about Resident Evil and chat will believe me because they think i'm a expert"
[1:37:17] <%SoaringLettuce> pat stop thinking
[1:37:17] <+donpatrondx> Senor Saddler
[1:37:18] <%crimsonharvest> is he a british Lord?
[1:37:22] <%lilgarbage_> parasites only speak English
[1:37:23] <%dreu81> p-p-pat stares at!
[1:37:25] <+necrocannibal2> LUL
[1:37:28] <%theAncopro> Ji Kala ool General Scales
[1:37:30] <%natebud> Google translate says no
[1:37:31] <%DedlokPM> Because Lord Saddler is his actual name
[1:37:32] <ReaversEdge45> Senor Salad
[1:37:32] <cardboardboots> jefe saddler
[1:37:32] <%Chatterbox1991> not El Rey or El Jefe?
[1:37:33] <Zaphire_Saucypants> there's a word for Lord you fucks
[1:37:33] <%ha2ken> Saddler-sama obviously....
[1:37:33] <%Idziman> Squid1 Squid2 psaLiz Squid2 Squid4
[1:37:34] <+machshop> just trust me
[1:37:36] <nitro4life2> Señor Sadler
[1:37:36] <%kyh9> lololololololol
[1:37:37] <@commanderclaw> Grande Padre Saddler
[1:37:38] <%Valdorick> El Sadler de Champion
[1:37:39] <+Shockrates20XX> notice me Saddler Sama
[1:37:39] <%SoaringLettuce> seÑor saddler
[1:37:40] <Royalguard22> Lord-o Sadler-o
[1:37:41] <%chambatron> It'd be like "Señor Saddler"
[1:37:44] <%Ganerumo> El Saddler Calvo Ultra Instinct
[1:37:45] <%rytisone> El Jefe Saddler
[1:37:46] <WizardofWazz> are you ok Pat?
[1:37:47] <%natebud> Lord is an english thing really
[1:37:48] <%Handsome0ne> It would actually be Señor Sadler
[1:37:49] <$Literal___Nobody> English? No Pat Leon and Ada can understand some Spanish
[1:37:50] <%dreu81> el heffe sadlero
[1:37:50] <%umbypokochan> Saddler-kuuuuuuun ♥
[1:37:50] <thelonechris> El Saddle
[1:37:53] <DrShyGuyDD> Lord is actually his forename
[1:37:53] <%JD_Lars> Grand Poobah Sadlie
[1:37:54] <%dirtyh4rr1> Señor is sir, not lord, there's no translation for lord
[1:37:55] <cureneckbeard> They think his first name is Lord
[1:37:55] <dan_g_v> Jefe is more of job type of thing
[1:37:55] <%SirGO0SE> @Ganerumo LUL
[1:38:08] <%natebud> just Senor Saddler
[1:38:09] <+Caidezes> Lord is a title though.
[1:38:10] <Martimnp> There is Lorde in Portuguese
[1:38:10] <%dreu81> just call him El Guapo
[1:38:11] <a_mad_dragon> Don Saddler
[1:38:11] <+machshop> yeah well this ain't fuckin france buddy
[1:38:11] <%DedlokPM> Because Lord Saddler is his actual name
[1:38:12] <Apolonm> Patron Sadler
[1:38:13] <%crimsonharvest> obviously you can us "señor" for "lord" its constantly like that in the bible
[1:38:14] <%SoFarFetched> Probably because lord in spanish didn't sound as menacing,since it would just be Senor Saddler.
[1:38:15] <%arsonistdaria> Kaiser Sadler
[1:38:18] <dan_g_v> Señor is the equivalent of Lord in religious tones, but it doesn't quite sound well for English speakers
[1:38:19] <deviljhojho_> El Guapo Grande
[1:38:21] <seniortrump> SEÑOR TRISTELER
[1:38:22] <+donpatrondx> Senor is the equivalent, even though we use it for elderly people nowadays as a show of respect
[1:38:24] <+machshop> Lordsaddler
[1:38:24] <%theAncopro> Lawd Saddler
[1:38:24] <%JD_Lars> Don Sadler?
[1:38:28] <%Garthunox> spelt gascoigne
[1:38:30] <+necrocannibal2> that might be it
[1:38:30] <%Th3SmartAlec> Lord is his first name
[1:38:32] <%SoFarFetched> Wasn't his name Osmund Saddler?
[1:38:34] <%peachy996> Saddler is a big idiot
[1:38:36] <%Idziman> I know a guy named Lord
[1:38:37] <korth367> ka ka sadlar
[1:38:37] <nitro4life2> Papi Saddler
[1:38:38] <%ElenaManetta> Mr. Saddler is his father
[1:38:40] <%valriot> Gasqwsng
[1:38:44] <%linSP> Assman Saddler
[1:38:50] <BRBN310> mayordomo saddler?
[1:38:51] <+ALazo> It all makes sense now
[1:38:51] <%Ganerumo> Who is stronger, El Señor Saddler or Ultra Instinct Luiz (Forma Ultima)
[1:38:54] <%Faustgesicht> His name is freaking "Osmund"
[1:38:54] <DrShyGuyDD> zoning
[1:38:56] <+Exyoh> Protect those cows
[1:38:59] <%BionoidLCR> Please Mr. Sadler is my father
[1:38:59] <+MrMcCrabby> ol lordy saddler
[1:39:00] <%realm_forge> In Canadian the term for lord to Top Moose
[1:39:00] <%dirtyh4rr1> Don is the closest, since it means of noble origin
[1:39:01] <%DedlokPM> @SoFarFetched No it's totally Lord.
[1:39:01] <samuelfisk> The fuck it is. It’s Osmund
[1:39:10] <%Alpha8087> Hey its horror Wild Guns
[1:39:11] <+necrocannibal2> Señor is the equivalent of Lord
[1:39:12] <%SoFarFetched> @DedlokPM oh lawdy
[1:39:14] <%peachy996> @Ganerumo 8th Form Irving Blanco
[1:39:24] <%SoaringLettuce> "mayordomo" means butler
[1:39:25] <GrandmasterBFunk> hey its that dog
[1:39:27] <cureneckbeard> Lord is Sadler's first name, like those guys named Earl.
[1:39:31] <%dirtyh4rr1> Señor is sir, not lord
[1:39:33] <%Alpha8087> LOL
[1:39:36] <%umbypokochan> lol the jiggles

[1:39:59] <lloyddboy> Barry FUCKS
[1:40:00] <ChrisM341> Plague of Plagas Kappa

[1:40:15] <DrShyGuyDD> psaWink_HE
[1:40:15] <%Gruntini> PlagasOfGripes
[1:40:16] <%Laecerelius> Yes but the trade off is no attache case
[1:40:18] <%Th3SmartAlec> @Rawklobstah88 Yes, because 1) Sherry getting impregnated by her father and 2) Ashford incest
[1:40:19] <%peachy996> I prefer the Attache
[1:40:21] <daisyyyy> Shoulda called him DIO Saddler
[1:40:22] <biomegabear> To be fair RE5 was just gonna be chris in africa
[1:40:25] <+MrMcCrabby> plague just wants you to stop shooting up his farm
[1:40:30] <evbites> damn
[1:40:31] <%Idziman> Has anyone ever seen that villager and Plague in the same room at the same time?
[1:40:31] <%SoaringLettuce> nope its nice to pause
[1:40:36] <%ElenaManetta> Resident Evil always felt like it was behind as far as gun gameplay was. Like the inability to aim and walk at the same time.
[1:40:38] <%BionoidLCR> LUL\
[1:40:38] <%SirFancySwank> diet moira

[1:40:44] <+Remery_> didnt Miora shoot her sister?
[1:40:44] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Yeah but was quick weapons switching worth only having 9 item slots per character
[1:40:45] <%peachy996> You get less items with 5's Attache over Big Dick Kennedy
[1:40:45] <TheMirai> that's an X-Men character, the doctor

[2:10:42] <%rytisone> Remake 4 in old camera style

[2:10:57] <+necrocannibal2> one
[2:10:58] <%Agami23> they shoulden't remake 4 but they should bring back las plaga just to see a REengine las plaga headpop

[2:13:00] <Ether101_Prime> The Merchant has the same VA as Leon and apperently he sounds like he could be from Astrila like Leon's grampa. Theory: He's supposed to be in Leon's head.

[2:15:18] <$vincerocmm> up close
[2:15:20] <+captain_elsewhere> as someone who was forced to learn welsh, no welsh is the evilest of languages
[2:15:21] <heartlesshealer> I'd say english because it just steals from all the other languages
[2:15:22] <%chhdez> True dat, french is up there
[2:15:23] <deviljhojho_> specifically, quebequois french
[2:15:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> @deviljhojho_ that dead language?

[2:16:42] <+necrocannibal2> @PatStaresAt El Patrício Furioso was better, Patrício Mira is lame
[2:16:47] <%davimotion96> I would say Basque is evil, everytime I hear someone speak it it sounds like they're summoning Cthulhu
[2:16:50] <%laundrysauce2> as a treat
[2:16:51] <%Idziman> was it worth the bloodshed?
[2:16:53] <%SirGO0SE> she is the salami queen
[2:16:57] <%Jekado> can i have a little salami?
[2:16:58] <%fattness132> dude salami is the best lunch meat
[2:17:02] <%luftraumm1> patricio encara es mejor
[2:17:02] <heartlesshealer> Paige has obtained "Nourishment"!
[2:17:04] <Torgue_1> With her bare hands?
[2:17:04] <%peachy996> She also almost died for the Salami so yeah have at it
[2:17:04] <%SoFarFetched> Is it because Pat is denying Paige "The Meat" for now until later.
[2:17:07] <Hotmemes420> salami with houmus slaps
[2:17:09] <the_sprankton> to keep you from having too much of it, will Paige be playing Hide the Salami?
[2:17:10] <%jorniev> patricio come chocolates en el closet
[2:17:11] <%terminallyCapriciousz> can paige share THE MEAT with the class?
[2:17:12] <+BubbaRands> It does go great with mustard
[2:17:12] <Badgerconda_> salami is top tier
[2:17:12] <FrankysDream> what's the current salami meta?
[2:17:13] <+Remery_> what does salami taste like? Is it like Bologna?

[2:17:27] <deviljhojho_> salami tastes like loinguini
[2:17:35] <%luftraumm1> chorizo Argentino es mejor que salame
[2:17:38] <%SoFarFetched> Trade salami for salami?
[2:17:39] <+unknownone> hey pat. i was shown your channel by my brother. i really appreciate you making him laugh
[2:17:40] <CptVolkow> Gotta get that protein
[2:17:41] <heartlesshealer> okay, those were two good back to back shots
[2:17:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> I would be a rich man
[2:17:44] <%Idziman> too long
[2:17:46] <%NitronStreams> salanomy
[2:17:47] <%Dr_Mooose> I only deal in salami
[2:17:48] <%GarbageNirvana> Salami is like spicy me
[2:17:50] <BallisticMeerkat> with an attitude like that sure...
[2:17:52] <%laundrysauce2> salami yo mommi
[2:17:53] <%GarbageNirvana> meat
[2:17:54] <+BubbaRands> Sooner than you think, but not as soon as you hope....
[2:17:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> but what about a salami TAKING based economy?
[2:17:55] <%laundrysauce2> i'm sorry
[2:17:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> OH WAIT we are talking the deli salami
[2:17:58] <deviljhojho_> yeah its not ideal
[2:18:01] <seniortrump> mi padre me toca
[2:18:01] <%ha2ken> Slide tech is strong
[2:18:02] <%davimotion96> el chorizo español es el mejor embutido
[2:18:03] <%SirGO0SE> Do you have change for 2 salami?
[2:18:05] <%peachy996> its goofy
[2:18:13] <%realm_forge> Sounds like an Italian prison economy
[2:18:16] <+SundanceShot> they slide like the burping nurses from sh4
[2:18:18] <%GarbageNirvana> Usually fermented air dried pork
[2:18:21] <%jorniev> a todos les gusta llevar chorizo
[2:18:27] <dan_g_v> and i just remembered inter species reviewers, and that big thick sausage and the salamander girl
[2:18:27] <%luftraumm1> de tras de ti imbecil
[2:18:33] <%SpeedWagonFDN> is RE5 going to be co op?
[2:18:39] <heartlesshealer> it's goofy, but more realistic than staying in place when having their knees blown out on a staircase
[2:18:45] <%RealThiele> it will be co-op unless paige sucks
[2:18:46] <+necrocannibal2> @SpeedWagonFDN yeah, with El Paje
[2:18:48] <seniortrump> ADA NO SUPLEXO
[2:18:51] <FrankysDream> hand job the fire
[2:19:00] <dan_g_v> The suplex of Ada?
[2:19:00] <%chhdez> El suplex grande
[2:19:02] <%natebud> I like how these plagas are trying to killing to kill you with circus tricks
[2:19:05] <%rytisone> activate lift first
[2:19:06] <nobknee> @PatStaresAt Been wonderin' lately, with your pained love of Star Trek, how do you feel about Babylon 5?
[2:19:07] <%ha2ken> Ada seems to put less effort into her back kick than Leon's
[2:19:07] <ChrisM341> Umbrella Corps remake when? Kappa
[2:19:13] <%jorniev> ADA USA TUS SUPLEX
[2:19:20] <+Kokonoter> dafuq? you can play as ada in re4?
[2:19:21] <+necrocannibal2> where's Saliva Melocóton?
[2:19:24] <%chhdez> Go suplex el buhonero
[2:19:27] <OToole42> si
[2:19:33] <heartlesshealer> guess
[2:19:36] <+Kokonoter> never played this game
[2:19:39] <%jorniev> urracarrana invertida
[2:19:41] <%laundrysauce2> the salami dudes
[2:19:47] <carlosmanriquez> puedes pero no en la versión de la gamecube
[2:19:48] <%jorniev> tirabuzon
[2:19:48] <%chhdez> Martinete
[2:19:56] <%RealThiele> very scenic
[2:19:59] <%Valdorick> psaCrazyhand
[2:20:07] <%SirGO0SE> is woolie streaming the granblue later?
[2:20:13] <%chhdez> RIP la Parca, btw
[2:20:14] <dan_g_v> why even take the ride, then?
[2:20:23] <%peachy996> Oh shit La Parka died?
[2:20:23] <%damienlunas> Salami would make a poor currency. It meets 1 out of 3 requirements for use as currency, because it is easily divisible into smaller amounts. However, the quality of all salami is not equal, making it difficult to measure value, and the currency is not lasting because it spoils.
[2:20:29] <%jorniev> la parca se murio!?
[2:20:31] <%chhdez> Yeah, recently
[2:20:32] <heartlesshealer> Not sure, Woolie needed rest time after Death Stranding finale
[2:20:40] <seniortrump> ew
[2:20:42] <heartlesshealer> probably later today
[2:20:44] <%peachy996> I'll waggle my knees and play air guitar with a chair in memory of him
[2:20:47] <%Ner234> Don't die Paige monkaS
[2:20:48] <+BubbaRands> I wonder where Ada keeps her ammo...
[2:20:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> SPINAL
[2:20:51] <Ether101_Prime> He hasn't had time to fully set up shot so no blue fire.
[2:20:51] <jeffishype> SPINAL
[2:20:52] <CptVolkow> Salami spoils?!
[2:20:57] <jeffishype> SPINNNNALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
[2:20:57] <%Dragon_Batman> SPINAAL
[2:21:02] <%Valdorick> What about Salami Packaging?
[2:21:14] <%peachy996> Crisis averted
[2:21:19] <%natebud> The man can teleport and he doesn't have time to light a torch
[2:21:22] <%chhdez> La Parca was the SPINAL of Mexican wrestling
[2:21:23] <%RealThiele> blue fire is ez just grab a bottle and goto the ice cave at zoras domain
[2:21:25] <Palmtuna> I had to shovel as soon as Paige died. Wha happun?
[2:21:25] <%peachy996> Now that they explained da blue fire
[2:21:27] <%rytisone> Ada is an early customer
[2:21:28] <ohgodscorpions> he literally sais that the first time you meet him
[2:21:32] <TriadOrion> Also I think the Merchant knows Ada's smart enough to find him while Leon's kind of a dummy and needs all the help he can get
[2:21:35] <CptVolkow> But in The Zone salami lasts forever
[2:21:41] <%SirGO0SE> @heartlesshealer agreed but if he does neat
[2:21:43] <JeighmesTV> the merchant's heart only burns for leon
[2:21:48] <%jorniev> RIP LA PARCA DESCANSA EN PAZ
[2:21:55] <%ha2ken> Upon seeing Ada...some started to burn within the Merchant...something he had never felt before...
[2:21:58] <%deadredeyez> even the guy with a truck in his living room had a blue fire
[2:21:59] <ChrisM341> Kappa
[2:22:01] <%chhdez> Paiges favorite wrestler
[2:22:05] <ohgodscorpions> yeah obviously
[2:22:10] <%natebud> yeah we wouldn't want any inconsistencies in RE
[2:22:13] <%Th3SmartAlec> That being Ada, you mean
[2:22:16] <+necrocannibal2> time paradox
[2:22:16] <%jorniev> SE MURIO EN ENERO
[2:22:17] <CamiHeart> Oh the villagers would rebuild fast.
[2:22:25] <%transporterthesequel> Paige is the hunter gatherer
[2:22:28] <%Dragon_Batman> He really wants to tho
[2:22:40] <heartlesshealer> hug the wall
[2:22:40] <FrankysDream> what if we just change all coins throughout the world to LOOK like slices of different sausages?

[2:49:01] <+nekodelic> in south america (and I'd guess a lot of other places that are not north america) we don't consider "latino" as a separate ethnicity, so "gringo" is race-neutral

[3:04:24] <%luftraumm1> weskerino
[3:04:26] <%vvitchguy> Beware his song about big butts, HE BEATS YOU UP WHILE HE PLAYS IT!
[3:04:30] <RobotInProgress> Shouts Luis like hes lost his son
[3:04:31] <%kyh9> "I haven't even seen him or his huge penis yet"
[3:04:32] <%Helmed> he has a nice turtleneck
[3:04:35] <greatspaceadventure> why is Duke Nukem in Resident Evil
[3:04:40] <%KingKZ> Why didn't Wesker just come in and wreck Saddler himself?
[3:04:42] <Roz_Lynd> see wesker is such an idiot
[3:04:45] <%peachy996> Wesker thinking Leon is lucky is good
[3:04:51] <Roz_Lynd> like... how is he a fucking head of umbella?
[3:04:53] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Wesker is not a smart man
[3:04:53] <%kewlmyc> Because Wesker sucks at planning
[3:04:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Is it ever explained why Ada is doing all this?
[3:04:57] <%peachy996> Aw YEA Krauser
[3:04:57] <%GameOver_Here> Wesker es un hombre no bueno
[3:05:09] <FunkyStreams> what kind of player is it? Its a visual player.
[3:05:12] <+necrocannibal2> Krauser, that good old pal we all know from previous games
[3:05:18] <rcand9> krauser is the best and the worst
[3:05:23] <%SirGO0SE> Well compensated Kreygasm
[3:05:27] <%Ganerumo> SHE STUDIES ALL HIS MOOOOVES
[3:05:27] <%FalseEyeD> I KNOW ALL YOUR MOVES
[3:05:28] <%Aydarkzero> i studied your moves Sony- Krauser
[3:05:30] <%ha2ken> He just needs nourishment for his arm to survive
[3:05:34] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Girl, you can study my combat style anyday.
[3:05:34] <+BubbaRands> Deal with him Kappa
[3:05:34] <tubit> it doesn't get more badass than a knife fight
[3:05:35] <%zamzoph> that "arm" of his
[3:05:35] <greatspaceadventure> chat here like RE4 taught me more than high school Spanish
[3:05:38] <%ElenaManetta> i was busy studying the krauser
[3:05:39] <%peachy996> So wait the arm was always around
[3:05:43] <%Pappajimbo> i studied all your moves
[3:05:44] <%linSP> I though Krauser died! thats what they told us!
[3:05:52] <FunkyStreams> neet
[3:05:57] <+Pomer> @necrocannibal2 you know?? our good buddy? our palbert? happy ol' guy, threw us a crowbar after the teleporter failed- wait
[3:06:00] <%peachy996> This story is messy
[3:06:03] <%cdrom321> What is Krauser from before?
[3:06:14] <+IShadowStrykerI> lol Leon's on a "lucky streak" but Krauser is the best wesker is funny
[3:06:15] <rcand9> krausers big chicken wing
[3:06:18] <+necrocannibal2> @cdrom321 a Wii light shooter released 9 years after
[3:06:23] <%natebud> Does the knife trick work with Ada though?
[3:06:28] <%peachy996> This is very RE0 style messy storytelling
[3:06:29] <NaturalGear> Krauser is such an MGS character
[3:06:40] <%ElenaManetta> i can take care of that big limb ; )
[3:06:42] <%Daisuke89> @cdrom321 He is from a mission with Leon in Darkside Chronicles shooter.
[3:06:42] <%BionoidLCR> @cdrom321 the umbrella chronicles rail shooters establish that him and leon worked together many times before
[3:06:43] <%Aydarkzero> just don't think about it
[3:06:44] <%SoFarFetched> LUL
[3:06:45] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Gimme more of that sweet sweet juice .
[3:06:45] <neVan0> in his juice
[3:06:45] <TheHotStuven> Pat she was worried about the fisting
[3:06:47] <+SlappyMeats> maybe she just meant his punching arm
[3:06:47] <%ElenaManetta> psa1guy
[3:06:48] <TheHotStuven> not the plagas
[3:06:49] <Ether101_Prime> The arm's supposed to be something else.
[3:06:52] <+Pomer> @PatStaresAt maybe she meant his dick
[3:06:53] <%marsproject> Implying he already had a big arm I guess before Las Plagas?
[3:06:53] <%luftraumm1> woolieLORE
[3:06:53] <%zamzoph> She was talking about his "arm"
[3:06:55] <SlimeSlimeSlime> RE4, CH4
[3:06:56] <KLouDraws> Yes/no?
[3:06:57] <%Maids4lyfe> maybe he had the arm before the las plagas?
[3:07:00] <%teddybomber> shhh dont think about it
[3:07:04] <pally_din> He evolved the arm from his military service duh
[3:07:06] <%jorniev> SIIIIIIIIII
[3:07:07] <Shwepie> These baked cutscenes look terrible.
[3:07:08] <%ElenaManetta> psa1guy psa1guy psa1guy
[3:07:09] <%luftraumm1> maybe she was talking abt his dick
[3:07:15] <%Aydarkzero> oooooh
[3:07:16] <rcand9> the arm is natural
[3:07:17] <FunkyStreams> hey its the guy. I know cus I just got a close up look of his face.
[3:07:22] <%jorniev> EL KRAUSERRRRR
[3:07:24] <greatspaceadventure> @Shwepie it's a very crusty pie

[3:07:31] <FunkyStreams> the guy from the visula player.
[3:07:32] <%jorniev> CRAUSER
[3:07:35] <%peachy996> Capcom kept killing the interesting villains off too soon
[3:07:35] <rcand9> the arm is krausers party trick
[3:07:37] <+necrocannibal2> is Krauser's arm juice or natty?
[3:07:38] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Jolly?
[3:07:43] <%Aydarkzero> it's crazy to me that Wesker never met Leon
[3:07:48] <%joylent_blue> why is wesker in an evil black void
[3:07:49] <auraofdawn> ada's gameboy is cool
[3:07:49] <%arsonistdaria> krauser skypes wesker asking if he's cheating on him
[3:07:51] <%Faustgesicht> Yeah, We'll see if the past occured.
[3:07:56] <samuelfisk> That Leon
[3:08:00] <%peachy996> I would have liked Krauser and Excella to stick around for another game till you killed them
[3:08:00] <%tigerfang86> Cause I want LEON DICK

[3:08:12] <%spiritofmojave> that talk with Krauser literally was that
[3:08:14] <%natebud> What do you think Wesker is paying Ada?
[3:08:14] <+SlappyMeats> she fuckin' goes in those heels

[3:16:35] <%ElenaManetta> on this boat and mansion*
[3:16:35] <TriadOrion> I mean, RPG7s are dirt cheap comparitively the other things on this list. :V
[3:16:36] <ChrisM341> Saddler is Big Boss confirmed?
[3:16:36] <%Maids4lyfe> IT'S EUROPE GUNS ARE BANNED
[3:16:36] <+SlappyMeats> crossbows are tradition
[3:16:37] <%zamzoph> What's a gun?
[3:16:38] <Kisiel250> all the money went to the boat
[3:16:38] <kerotuyu> It wasn't in the budget
[3:16:38] <+BubbaRands> What's your point?
[3:16:38] <%Mister_McDerp> they don't like guns I guess
[3:16:38] <+Hellhander> Budget cuts gotta be made somewhere
[3:16:38] <This_is_Marco> CoolStoryBob CoolStoryBob
[3:16:39] <%Laecerelius> Don't forget the room full of lava
[3:16:39] <%akumakins> Its those European gun control laws
[3:16:39] <%peachy996> and axes
[3:16:40] <friendlyrogue> crosssbows are cheap and arming an army is expensive
[3:16:40] <%Dr_DangerPhD> 1% of ganados have 99% of the wealth
[3:16:41] <%chhdez> Pat's all "But i will never stop, i'm the BIG PAT THAT MAKES ALL OF THE RULES"
[3:16:42] <%SirGO0SE> but its the.....mk 2..2
[3:16:43] <%juxtest> The Merchant bought up all the guns on the island
[3:16:43] <%umbypokochan> what about biggatling gun man?
[3:16:43] <%miguelrod777> all our budget went into the boat
[3:16:44] <%ChaosAethr> BUDGET
[3:16:45] <%CalderGaming> poor budget allocation
[3:16:47] <%SirFancySwank> budget had to be cut some where
[3:16:47] <cureneckbeard> The minigun guy uses up all their ammo.
[3:16:49] <+BringBackSempai> in short, rural europe is a land of contrasts
[3:16:51] <%ElenaManetta> their soldiers are beyond disposable
[3:16:52] <regabt> Bullets are expensive
[3:16:55] <Dova573> i bet that had a ton of nazi gold
[3:16:56] <daisyyyy> Ammo is EXPENSIVE
[3:16:56] <%jorniev> los iluminados son narcos si tiene sentido asi
[3:16:58] <+BubbaRands> Shut up religion tho
[3:16:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> What a boat mansion! Oh wait, no, that's RE: Rev1
[3:17:01] <%peachy996> Saddler is not a smart man
[3:17:01] <%Mr_Pylon> don t forget the magma forge
[3:17:01] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Guns are only legal if they're attached to a boat in Europe
[3:17:03] <%ElenaManetta> the crossbows are worth more than the hordes of villagers they throw at leon and ada
[3:17:04] <Zedimonx5> BUT THE BOAT THO psaBougie
[3:17:06] <%Dragovus> @PatStaresAt The use of only crossbows allowed them to save enough money to buy all that other stuff
[3:17:07] <nuane> arming zombies with guns is a waste of time
[3:17:07] <%bluebiscuit94> Listen Saddler REALLY wanted his Big Boat!
[3:17:09] <%Aydarkzero> they stole the boat
[3:17:12] <HolyRabbles> I just watched the TBFP LP of this. Surreal watching this now!
[3:17:13] <%miguelrod777> it was dicounted
[3:17:13] <RobotInProgress> if anything the crossbows are the outlier here
[3:17:14] <ioci95> guns are expensive in europe, boats are cheap
[3:17:15] <+Pendragwn> no
[3:17:15] <%Dr_Mooose> no :(
[3:17:17] <SlimeSlimeSlime> I want to shoot a boat out of a gun.
[3:17:17] <KingGoblodyte> BUT IT'S LOD
[3:17:18] <+BringBackSempai> they just like larping pat
[3:17:18] <tubit> boats are the epitome of expense
[3:17:20] <KingGoblodyte> OLD
[3:17:21] <%rytisone> maybe they hijacked the "boat"
[3:17:22] <%Laecerelius> Look, they spent a bunch on the boat and forgot about buying guns
[3:17:22] <%peachy996> Salazar had more brains, least he stays in his castle
[3:17:22] <%Slaardacity> that's how they got the boat, all the money they saved on bullets
[3:17:23] <%joylent_blue> oh jesus
[3:17:23] <srkAres> a boat is a hole in the water that eats money. so no funds for bullets.
[3:17:24] <%chhdez> Boatmaster here, eh
[3:17:25] <redrins> salazar doesnt believe in guns bigger than him
[3:17:25] <%GameOver_Here> BOATS AND HOS
[3:17:25] <%KingKZ> They won it in a mystery box.
[3:17:26] <%natebud> These zombies are bursting with gold and gemstones. THERE'S BULETS EVERYWHERE
[3:17:26] <+Hellhander> That boat fell off the back of a truck
[3:17:26] <fascistznik> shut up, pat boats aren't real
[3:17:26] <FunkyStreams> boats are like the most exspensive.
[3:17:26] <%Garthunox> come to da back a da boooooat
[3:17:29] <%umbypokochan> pat's gonna die, watch
[3:17:30] <%jorniev> IF YOU ARE A NARCO YOU CAN TOTALLY GET ABOAT

[3:17:44] <greatspaceadventure> splash n' dash
[3:17:44] <%ElenaManetta> why do you assume they bought anything? they're evil cult, they couldve just stolen whatever they could get away with. that's why it's all random shit!!!

[3:17:49] <Roz_Lynd> well that happened
[3:17:49] <FunkyStreams> that stright up sounds exactly like the chaingun noise from Halo CE
[3:17:50] <DeRedBaron> it gets even more weird when you realize that enemies drop ammunition and you find some firearms while in the areas
[3:17:50] <%natebud> There's literally bullets everywhere and no guns
[3:17:50] <%Laecerelius> Why not shotgun?
[3:17:51] <%akumakins> f
[3:17:52] <tubit> you are dead
[3:17:52] <%rytisone> Kenny wins
[3:17:53] <%Aydarkzero> guys i know having a spy infiltrate your island isn't the greatest thing but don't you think using a TURRET is a bit overkill?

[3:18:18] <Shadope342> LUL
[3:18:20] <%natebud> Maybe the crossbows are a cultural thing

[3:29:08] <%CalderGaming> "I was watching the 'ole thing i was. That shit was sick, stranger!"
[3:29:12] <%optimasmaximas> @AliceAstro is this recent? all i can find is stuff from 2018 and 2016

[3:35:32] <AliceAstro> @optimasmaximas clearly no one in the video is having fun, makes me wonder wtf she gets paid if she's willing to do shit like that
[3:35:35] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:35:36] <%Dr_Mooose> LUL
[3:35:36] <Marpolo13> ha
[3:35:36] <FunkyStreams> 420 quick scopes
[3:35:37] <stevenellis386> PRO
[3:35:39] <%peachy996> ohno
[3:35:41] <Meekest> Dying on easy mode
[3:35:42] <+Bipolarhernandez> LUL
[3:35:44] <Manwad> Faded
[3:35:46] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Doh!
[3:35:55] <Oxybe> !uptime
[3:35:56] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 35m.
[3:36:00] <McAngrimStein> only easier and easier mode
[3:36:01] <SlimeSlimeSlime> Pat Mode
[3:36:01] <%joylent_blue> only degrees of easy mode
[3:36:04] <tubit> ezmodo
[3:36:08] <+Bipolarhernandez> I WAS PRESSING BUTTONS
[3:36:09] <%BoomerUnchained> baby mode is now avaulable
[3:36:09] <%nivlac_555> normal is for babby
[3:36:12] <McAngrimStein> ehhh? he plays on easy?
[3:36:12] <ChrisM341> Now I' motivated
[3:36:15] <rcand9> ye limmyHeadshake
[3:36:16] <This_is_Marco> CoolStoryBob oh rly
[3:36:19] <the_sprankton> don't speedrunners tank to lower the difficulty?
[3:36:20] <UncleAndross_> what about baby mode?
[3:36:20] <%joylent_blue> pvpMotivated
[3:36:28] <Hellarussian> normal is for diaper babies
[3:36:40] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Weird how Pat somehow unlocked easy mode despite it not existing normally :)
[3:36:42] <Zaphire_Saucypants> shit the bed?
[3:36:48] <%natebud> Nah this is leagues worse than Leon's island
[3:36:48] <%peachy996> You think Professional is named as such because of Leon the Professional?
[3:36:52] <%Sir_stride> but still ok.
[3:36:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> It feels like most RE games suffer this issue
[3:36:59] <McAngrimStein> The game gets real tough if you start Professional and only reload saves on death instead of restarting checkpoints
[3:37:04] <%chhdez> Gunslinger
[3:37:09] <%valriot> Pat says RE4 is bad, you heard it here
[3:37:15] <%CalderGaming> he dance
[3:37:18] <FunkyStreams> loool
[3:37:18] <+TheFabledAble> IN THE DIC
[3:37:22] <+Bipolarhernandez> shot that guy's balls off
[3:37:25] <%StaceMcGate> RE7 after halfway mark is piss easy
[3:37:29] <Hellarussian> is Pat trying to cancel RE4?
[3:37:31] <rcand9> loved 2s lab
[3:37:32] <Zaphire_Saucypants> they become more actiony
[3:37:33] <FunkyStreams> he just shot that dude in the dick like 20 times
[3:37:33] <%Sir_stride> does RE2 remake have this issue?
[3:37:34] <%peachy996> Yup
[3:37:37] <ChrisM341> Except for 6
[3:37:38] <%Darren716> RE2 gets weak in the middle
[3:37:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> and less spooky
[3:37:40] <KoltonSaurus> Should we get you some choccy milk for your baby game?
[3:37:41] <%natebud> And you hit the lab pretty early
[3:37:41] <ChrisM341> Kappa
[3:37:42] <%luftraumm1> capcom in general struggles with endings
[3:37:43] <Vohs_Bru> but WESKER
[3:37:43] <Marpolo13> what about 6
[3:37:45] <%peachy996> Earlier in my opinion
[3:37:46] <%GameOver_Here> Best lab in an RE game?
[3:37:48] <%FalseEyeD> RE2 Remakes lab at least is cool
[3:37:49] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I think RE2 Remake handled it VERY well tho
[3:37:49] <%Darren716> REmake 2 lab i find fun
[3:37:50] <%GarbageNirvana> But this had the hallway like in the movie Pat
[3:37:53] <%Renuarb> @PatStaresAt Since RE6 has no LAB, does that game never fall off?!
[3:37:53] <rcand9> remakes lab is perfect too
[3:37:55] <%valriot> RE2 Remake didn't fall apart I'd say
[3:37:56] <%GarbageNirvana> LIKE IN THE MOVIE
[3:38:01] <%fruit_pie_the_magician> RE5lls apart at the fucking temple
[3:38:03] <%Sir_stride> But RE5 does have wesker, so I say it balances out
[3:38:09] <%CalderGaming> remake 2 lab was short, sweet, and pretty much the end
[3:38:13] <%luftraumm1> re2 remake is maybe their best game
[3:38:19] <%peachy996> AS SOON as you get in that fucking jeep RE5 completely falls apart
[3:38:20] <tri3dgE027> RE3 kinda is good once you reach the Factory, but that maybe just the nostalgia kicking in
[3:38:21] <pally_din> Yeah I feel like both re2 and re2 remake's labs didnt' overstay their welcome
[3:38:24] <%natebud> The boat and lab in RE7 are only good on Madhouse for some reason
[3:38:26] <%Garthunox> oh no
[3:38:29] <%Darren716> REmake 2 lab looks way better because it's right after the fucking sewars
[3:38:30] <%StaceMcGate> RE 0 stayed consistently difficult Kappa
[3:38:34] <Zedimonx5> Re6 is the exception because the game never excelled to begin with
[3:38:40] <%TenguGemini> has the RE4 shopkeeper been in any of the side games or is 4 still his only appearance?
[3:38:50] <%michingmallecho> So R2make is good apatSmug
[3:38:50] <+Remery_> But Sheva and her cute accent made up for it tho
[3:38:54] <%peachy996> No
[3:38:55] <Hellarussian> the only consistently good character in RE is Steve
[3:38:56] <McAngrimStein> Early Leon in RE6 was excellent imo
[3:38:56] <Texascourierlive> EYE-PATCH is crying over AMVs from the 2000s right
[3:38:57] <%arsonistdaria> You hope they'll tighten up 3 in the same way?
[3:38:57] <%peachy996> No it dont
[3:38:58] <%CalderGaming> i forgot if revelations 2 had a lab >_>
[3:39:01] <rcand9> worst lab of the main 7?
[3:39:02] <ChrisM341> I liked the beginning of Leon's campaign in 6.... and the mercenaries was okay
[3:39:21] <mMayrro> holy fuck this case organization hurts me
[3:39:28] <%valriot> I actually really like the lab in RE2R, it just has the same problem of not being a part of the same area, and kind of just being a mini gauntlet or micro "mansion"
[3:39:35] <GiygasDrillBreak> lets count in Resident Evil. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Revelations, Revelations 2, 7
[3:39:42] <%natebud> zero or CVX @rcand9
[3:39:44] <KeystoneA1> I can never find the 3rd eye in Leon's campaign
[3:39:54] <%Sir_stride> yeah. I usually just sell the rifle
[3:40:05] <%Sir_stride> or not buy it
[3:40:10] <%Sir_stride> which ever
[3:40:21] <%valriot> Ada gonna schlick to a sick knife fight
[3:40:27] <rcand9> @natebud i was excluding them because they are allround awful
[3:40:30] <%SatoLol> SatoLol subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey Pat Just wanted to thank you for being on Twitch While I'm Coughing my Guts out. #HopeitsnotCoronaVirus
[3:40:31] <%TheWinged7> i think yo mean "take a look at this"
[3:40:35] <%StaceMcGate> BULLET SPONGE
[3:40:38] <%MalekDracarus> @PatStaresAt Is it just me or does Ada and Leon have the same hairstyle?
[3:40:45] <McAngrimStein> More that the shotgun isn't great for those guys
[3:40:46] <tubit> they do
[3:40:49] <FunkyStreams> It would seem the shotty is not a good choice for those dudes.
[3:40:52] <srkAres> that shotgun damage really drops off past the first foot or so
[3:40:56] <%michingmallecho> Leon piloting a jet liner was....
[3:40:59] <%jorniev> that is why you get so much shotgun ammo cause its sucks
[3:41:00] <eco419> SeemsGood
[3:41:00] <%valriot> Asian Leon
[3:41:02] <%natebud> @rcand9 Then 6, leon's america lab is awful
[3:41:04] <%FalseEyeD> A what
[3:41:04] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie bait hairstyle
[3:41:05] <mMayrro> plaga dude dropped an item
[3:41:14] <+Shackle_Rustyford> this is how i open doors

[3:41:18] <UncleAndross_> i'm gonna need that smooch demo again
[3:41:20] <+SlappyMeats> *mrauh*
[3:41:28] <+Bipolarhernandez> Plaga: "NOOOO STOP SHOOTING ME IN THE DICK"
[3:41:29] <%valriot> Ada shooting like she's in the LAPD
[3:41:29] <UncleAndross_> oh yes
[3:41:31] <%FalseEyeD> ...

[3:44:02] <%Caped_Eggy> That's a fucking jump
[3:44:02] <Hellarussian> ok
[3:44:08] <+SlappyMeats> it's very stupid
[3:44:10] <UncleAndross_> I mean, it's true for... everything?
[3:44:10] <ChrisM341> So Leon takes Krauser's knife here... but Krauser has his knife during his boss fight
[3:44:10] <tubit> it doesn't flow
[3:44:11] <Vohs_Bru> just like everyone else
[3:44:14] <+SundanceShot> everything krauser says is dumb as shit
[3:44:14] <+DinnerCalzone> all death is inevitable krauser
[3:44:14] <%strugglepunk2> Krauser's a soldier, not a worder, pat.
[3:44:15] <rcand9> krauser is so dumb awesome
[3:44:15] <arkv01> "we fucked a few times"
[3:44:17] <%natebud> you may be alive, but that won't stop you from being DEAD
[3:44:17] <eco419> agreed

[3:44:22] <%StaceMcGate> BLUE BALLS
[3:44:25] <%Shadicara> Krauser has a back up knife
[3:44:25] <%Aydarkzero> he thought it sounded cool

[4:04:33] <%Shadicara> POOP STOOL
[4:04:34] <%SilverJakler> the
[4:04:34] <+SlappyMeats> better than pooping on your stand stool
[4:04:34] <%Swampykins> Says you
[4:04:35] <Jimhalla> .........on?
[4:04:36] <%Jekado> she could be doing both!
[4:04:37] <TechDragon_Z> Why y'all pooping on stools
[4:04:37] <%joylent_blue> please don't elaborate
[4:04:37] <%SilverJakler> WHAT Stool?
[4:04:38] <Meekest> HOW SHORT ARE YOU
[4:04:38] <+necrocannibal2> @SoFarFetched she's actually pretty short
[4:04:38] <%arsonistdaria> sorry
[4:04:39] <Zaphire_Saucypants> You got yourself one of those poop stools?
[4:04:40] <%SoFarFetched> NOT AS SHORT AS YOU
[4:04:40] <+SlumberMan> It's so you can reach the toilet, right?
[4:04:40] <%peachy996> yeah sure
[4:04:41] <alyss988> ??
[4:04:42] <%Breaknoon> squatty potty?
[4:04:42] <+PhysicsLB> everyone looks tall next to pat
[4:04:42] <%Emperor_Machinus> You poop on the stool not stand on it
[4:04:44] <%chhdez> Just baby-proof the house, Pat
[4:04:44] <%Zerodyne90> you really got that
[4:04:45] <+Pendragwn> Is it so your feet don't dangle on the floor when you poop
[4:04:45] <+saltytyrz> I don't know. explain
[4:04:46] <%Maids4lyfe> but Paige is so tall compared to you
[4:04:46] <GhostLanterns> still taller than me >:(
[4:04:47] <%bread_assassin> Why poop on a stool?
[4:04:47] <+AXL808> She's a GIANT
[4:04:47] <%MoralCompassGaming> it's just for raising your legs, it can't take much weight
[4:04:47] <%Estuko> monkaS
[4:04:48] <%Mister_McDerp> short is relative
[4:04:48] <%ShogunNoonto> wait what
[4:04:50] <%Th3SmartAlec> She looks like 6 2 next to you
[4:04:54] <Vohs_Bru> but giants were the previous owners Pat?
[4:04:55] <alyss988> How disgusting
[4:04:56] <%zamzoph> disgusting DansGame
[4:04:57] <Shwepie> If Paige is 5'4", does that mean you're 4'5"?
[4:04:58] <weirdmothgirl> The stool raises your legs to make pooping easier
[4:04:58] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Nah, the using the stool while pooping is ACTUALLY the best way to poop
[4:04:58] <%peachy996> ew
[4:05:00] <%SoFarFetched> @necrocannibal2 oh no i've met her in real life LUL but Im going by pat's height compared to her.
[4:05:01] <%Breaknoon> squaty potty?
[4:05:01] <%Zerodyne90> thats what she said
[4:05:04] <+chaumiester> Wait.... Paige is 5'4''? Wait, aren't you 5'2''?
[4:05:05] <RatherUninteresting> you poop on a stool?
[4:05:05] <Zedimonx5> Why would you shit on a stool?
[4:05:06] <shaggycactus> nah she tall
[4:05:07] <%ShogunNoonto> then how tall are you ?
[4:05:08] <%joylent_blue> ha, idiot
[4:05:16] <heartlesshealer> the thing you put your feet on so that your legs and body are forced into angles that help facilitate smoother, less painful poops
[4:05:16] <%Estuko> that body in the garbage bin flailing freaked me out bad enough to make me stop playing for a few weeks. NotLikeThis my poor dumb child brain wasn't ready
[4:05:16] <%Grayhammatter> he's doing it
[4:05:17] <GiygasDrillBreak> pat is normal height
[4:05:18] <%terminallyCapriciousz> pat is like 4'8"
[4:05:18] <+necrocannibal2> @SoFarFetched yeah, compared to Pat, she's a giant
[4:05:24] <%Breaknoon> Paige doesnt look short
[4:05:24] <%Mister_McDerp> pat is 3 feet tall
[4:05:25] <+TheBitingIrish> She needs a step stool to reach the shitter?
[4:05:26] <%Th3SmartAlec> This is the 5 9 vs 5 10 meme
[4:05:27] <+Remery_> Pat's small enough to be a garden gnome
[4:05:29] <%Reevesypoo> hehe peachstooliva
[4:05:29] <heartlesshealer> it's real and it works
[4:05:30] <%natebud> I hate games where every little interesting thing has to be explained in some mundane way. Don't you want to know who closed the dumpster!?
[4:05:34] <McAngrimStein> Ada vapes
[4:05:35] <%Zerodyne90> bless you
[4:05:36] <Reizie_Etherealm> How much ordnance is packed into that tip? Jesus
[4:05:38] <Zaphire_Saucypants> we were literally made to poop crouched.
[4:05:40] <%MoralCompassGaming> The stool raises your legs to a squat position so your stool passes easier.
[4:05:41] <Arek_1> Bless you.
[4:05:41] <Alexisonfires> I thought Paige was like 5’10 rooThink
[4:05:42] <studleydoorite> Pat is getting shorter by the minute
[4:05:44] <%Dragovus> Just like Punisher Warzone
[4:05:46] <%fattness132> Remember that picture of Pat with the chocolate bunny that someone analyzed for pats height?
[4:05:49] <%realm_forge> Pat can expand to 5ft 11 in when threatened
[4:05:50] <weirdmothgirl> Real soldiers poop in prone
[4:05:52] <+TheBitingIrish> @Zaphire_Saucypants Good point
[4:05:54] <Run44forrest> pats feet dangle off the toilet hence he needs a stool
[4:06:01] <+necrocannibal2> that chocolate bunny picture is still hilarious
[4:06:02] <wqorst> LUL
[4:06:03] <GiygasDrillBreak> Pat's height is reduced by the weight of his dick
[4:06:03] <%Reevesypoo> Pat is actually 6'4"
[4:06:04] <%BoomerUnchained> poop tech!
[4:06:06] <+necrocannibal2> Pat is babby
[4:06:08] <Run44forrest> a stool for his stool
[4:06:08] <%XeroSigmaPrime> I hate when peopl say theyre 6' foot, when they're clearly 5 inches shorter than me, some who is actually 6 foot
[4:06:12] <+TheBitingIrish> @Zaphire_Saucypants Japan has the right idea
[4:06:18] <%Breaknoon> time to play Killer 7
[4:06:18] <%Grayhammatter> big not dead
[4:06:21] <%Th3SmartAlec> Put it in its MOOUUUTTHHH
[4:06:21] <%MelBrooksKA> not yet
[4:06:21] <%umbypokochan> she wants to kiss him, she's just in denial
[4:06:28] <%JJCheeker> Is waiting for Leon
[4:06:35] <%Ipsenscastle> why especially the mouth?
[4:06:37] <+TheBitingIrish> I'm like a tenth of an inch away from 6ft FeelsBadMan
[4:06:45] <%Th3SmartAlec> HE WOULD HAVE MISSED
[4:06:46] <%Estuko> what kind of body strength do you need to climb over a high ledge and perform a front flip using an arm
[4:06:48] <%Funky_Honkey> wait, he survived?
[4:06:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I KNEW IT
[4:06:52] <+SundanceShot> WITNESS THE POWER
[4:06:53] <+PhysicsLB> he's a cutie
[4:06:54] <%luftraumm1> did you shoot the tiny bag?
[4:06:55] <%peachy996> Krauser says nothing
[4:06:56] <pally_din> He was just pretending
[4:06:57] <%Emperor_Machinus> Soul Calibur
[4:06:58] <Run44forrest> any short kings in chat
[4:07:00] <%natebud> Notice that Krauser has no new lines at all
[4:07:01] <hat_under_bread> That's a good line.
[4:07:04] <%rytisone> I hope I won't have to report for this
[4:07:06] <Eldalu> someone had a rough night
[4:07:06] <+Remery_> well can't wank with that hand anymore

[4:07:32] <ThDark> @XeroSigmaPrime You say that, but how do we know YOU'RE not 5 inches shorter than 6'? We need a 3rd 6' tall person to verify
[4:07:36] <%umbypokochan> omg, all you have to do is knife his legs lol
[4:07:37] <+SlappyMeats> Krauser: "..." (because they didn't record any new lines)
