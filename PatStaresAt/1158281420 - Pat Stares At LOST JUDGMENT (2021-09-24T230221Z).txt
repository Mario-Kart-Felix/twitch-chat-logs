[0:07:48] <%RealThiele> ah fanciness not ready yet
[0:07:50] <DianaTheAscian> Anime ED with Pat running to the left
[0:07:52] <Cynical2DD> Did Pat just start? It sounds like he’s ending the stream
[0:08:09] <%terrible35> gotta promote the feature yo
[0:08:14] <%PocketBearIllustrator> pat's over here, financially supporting and crediting artists and animators. that's a sign of a fine ass dude.

[0:10:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I sadly literally cant get a console BibleThump
[0:10:29] <Cynical2DD> When NMH3
[0:10:31] <%Mr_Pylon> maybe by then  the PS5 will be available
[0:10:33] <%rekinom> plus by that point the price will likely have come down
[0:10:36] <draca23> PS4 Pro preferably as it is easier to find and you can get it at a decent price.
[0:10:44] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Fuck yeah, Pat time
[0:11:02] <%PocketBearIllustrator> streaming games to play is just a disaster waiting to happen if you don't have good Internet
[0:11:05] <$Ziegsy> it removes the monster ;;
[0:11:06] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt You don't
[0:11:07] <Cynical2DD> I just discovered that FF7 Intergrade is PS5 exclusive. DAMNIT
[0:11:12] <%AyotoCorp> As long as you have your save
[0:11:22] <%machshop> ay blinken
[0:11:23] <+JustToWatch> ask Gene, he's been playing it
[0:11:30] <%RealThiele> ow
[0:11:34] <%Issun135> Issun135 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 19 months! oh no, 2 years of staring at pat.
[0:11:41] <%ThomasOfTroy> I will
[0:11:47] <%twistedj3ster> That barrel had no honor
[0:11:52] <%ThomasOfTroy> But yes, go to hospital
[0:11:52] <%rekinom> That seems like a perfectly reasonable reason to cry
[0:11:54] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I still have 4 hours of work :D it's not broken thanks for asking
[0:11:55] <+Vigonept> what a punk cant even withstand 300 lbs lmao
[0:12:02] <%tigerfang86> yeah but that barrel was SO HEAVY
[0:12:04] <%Piemono> No Warf wanted to kill himself
[0:12:09] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> LMAOOOOO thanks pat
[0:12:15] <%SovPho> Feet are weird. My step dad ran over my foot with a mazda 3 and I didn't even feel it, but I kicked an empty cardboard box a broke my toe once
[0:12:15] <%RealThiele> abelincoln canon stronger than worf
[0:12:18] <%rekinom> He's just so enchanting
[0:12:22] <%Issun135> its been a weird 2 years
[0:12:23] <+RoByte2> To be fair, the barrel didn't kill Worf.  The quack doctor did
[0:12:32] <%PocketBearIllustrator> crying in general shouldn't be a reason to think less of anyone, honestly.
[0:12:37] <%bob900000> DAIGO
[0:12:38] <%akscully> same!  crying is good and cool!
[0:12:38] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> I'm American so hospital is a no no
[0:12:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Same
[0:12:45] <%rekinom> Machismo go down
[0:12:56] <%Mr_Pylon> Yeah you would have mocked yourself for the Daigo tears
[0:12:58] <+JustToWatch> when was the last time to really cried on stream? Adios?
[0:12:59] <SomersaultJustice> it's cause pat found luuuvvvvvvv
[0:13:04] <+Vigonept> ive gotten more exasperated. like "holy shit did i just break my pinky?"
[0:13:17] <tanarath> but then he did cry
[0:13:17] <%rekinom> "Who's mommas little pissbaby?"
[0:13:19] <%twistedj3ster> I can't cry about rl stuff, but movies get me easy
[0:13:23] <Blank9> yeah but like what if the handkerchief you wipe tears away with has like, a cool skull on it
[0:13:24] <missingangle> Pat cries live on stream about sandwiches
[0:13:30] <+DeaneFox> the whole "men can't show emotion outside of anger" thing in society is so fucked up
[0:13:30] <%Issun135> its time to heat action the kids
[0:13:30] <IssaBoneman> @patstaresat yo you gonna check out VHS beta when it comes out??
[0:13:37] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I wonder what wacky things will happen now
[0:13:44] <%akscully> cried over daigo
[0:13:49] <%Monkeyweed21> Pat cried for Daigo
[0:13:50] <%condemned_15> you cried for Daigo
[0:13:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat cried for Aunt May too
[0:13:58] <DianaTheAscian> Daigo
[0:13:59] <missingangle> ain't no shame about crying, though, for real. Unless it's for Daigo. Then we laugh
[0:14:00] <%terrible35> LUL
[0:14:01] <%bob900000> pat loves daigo
[0:14:01] <%zeroarturia> Like Spiderman ending
[0:14:04] <%NateyBeak> yakuza 7 when HE showed up
[0:14:05] <%Agami23> god the ending to yakuza 6
[0:14:05] <%MelBrooksKA> Cried for a character he didn't like
[0:14:07] <Krisaeron> Ayyo hello OrbLord
[0:14:08] <PanicSwytch> Spiderman aunt may scene
[0:14:10] <Thepothero> i cried for Emet @PatStaresAt
[0:14:21] <%Ganerumo> I seem to remember you sounded like you were sobbing a bit during the walking dead S1 ending
[0:14:21] <BangkokTraveller> What chapter is this?
[0:14:26] <draca23> I got tricked into crying for Daigo too.
[0:14:28] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Lasst time I got teary in a game was VA11-HALL-A during the midgame
[0:14:30] <%blankwaffle> seeing deku crying in the first episode of mha gets me and I hate it
[0:14:30] <%tigerfang86> Daigo literally sells out 85% of the time
[0:14:33] <%condemned_15> Daigo is incompetent
[0:14:33] <%Monkeyweed21> Daigo was handed a bad situation and did really bad with it
[0:14:34] <%twistedj3ster> he was also just a bad chairman
[0:14:35] <televisedrevolting> Cause the Tojo was dying.
[0:14:36] <%RealThiele> that seto scene made me cry like a baby
[0:14:40] <Blank9> to be fair, majima did JACK SHIT for Daigo outside of 2
[0:14:49] <%Felhad> Hey Pat! Got my RDM up to 75, doing that big Bozja grinding.
[0:14:52] <%tigerfang86> he's a big sellout that does ok things SOMETIMES BUT NOT USUALLY
[0:14:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its also that Yakuza 6 tricks you into thinking he's talking to Haruka which is what we wanted to see
[0:15:02] <draca23> Daigo fucking sucks. Yakuza 5, when he is most competent, still gets his ass kicked by a non-yakuza.
[0:15:02] <%bob900000> it felt really forced
[0:15:03] <missingangle> Daigo sells out as much a popular twitch streamer.
[0:15:03] <%tank7013> And then Kiryu completely misplaced his faith in Daigo and the Tojo died
[0:15:04] <televisedrevolting> He was handed the wheel of a sinking ship and asked to not sink.
[0:15:05] <%RayReborne> k bye, have to beat judgment one first LATER ORBMAN
[0:15:08] <@ssjklyco> Is that why you left him to die in the Yakuza 0 LP years ago?
[0:15:10] <DianaTheAscian> He's also a shit in Zero to
[0:15:13] <DXLelouch24> He kept fucking things up EVERY SINGLE TIME
[0:15:13] <%akscully> gasp!
[0:15:13] <Sunstalker> also we have to fight his stupid bitch ass on the millenial tower
[0:15:13] <DianaTheAscian> PAT
[0:15:14] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Hustle. LOYALTY. Respect
[0:15:21] <Krisaeron> OH CMON THE MOST FUN PART
[0:15:21] <%polothegreatest> daigo wasnt real yakuza
[0:15:22] <%Felhad> D:

[0:16:11] <scrumbotime> They really said "We don't get another one, so lets put EVERYTHING in here"
[0:16:12] <%justcallmebobplease> How Onizuka out of Ten would you say you are right now, Pat?
[0:16:14] <%bustawof> yagami's a hell of a teacher
[0:16:25] <SomersaultJustice> I can't believe this game stole from deadly premonition 2 Kappa
[0:16:32] <tanarath> I see how it is, ditching your og board.
[0:16:33] <%RoggleJr> Yes.
[0:16:35] <Krisaeron> yes

[0:17:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GYARU GIRL? HELL YEAH
[0:17:15] <+PenmanLupine> Honestly, Sega should just take this game and make an actual Great Teacher Onizuka game.
[0:17:30] <%tigerfang86> oh boyyyyy
[0:17:34] <DXLelouch24> Does Amasawa hate her?
[0:17:34] <Krisaeron> Sooo.... TOKYO MANJI GANG?!
[0:17:36] <%rbakervv> nooooooo
[0:17:40] <marvel877> I got to get re-read and finish GTO.

[0:18:58] <%notsoy> Takayuki Hawk
[0:18:59] <%RoggleJr> Bob Burnquist would be proud.
[0:19:00] <Cynical2DD> This doesn’t play like Tony Hawk does it

[0:19:52] <%tank7013> It was real cool of Violet to offer to mc this skate competition
[0:19:57] <Treasure_Vault> the classic tony hawk pro skater level: room
[0:20:00] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if they added a dlc that brought in Tony Hawk as an NPC for you to skate duel against?
[0:20:08] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Wait how old is Yagami meant to be?
[0:20:08] <punks55> hit a yagami air
[0:20:15] <%akscully> lmao lapped him
[0:20:19] <Krisaeron> Yagami is like 30ish
[0:20:19] <%tigerfang86> STOMPED THOSE KIDS
[0:20:22] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I can't tell if he's like 25 or 40
[0:20:24] <%notsoy> lmao i couldn't imagine anything more rad for this minigame
[0:20:24] <%Monkeyweed21> @JustAnotherTrapArtist 38
[0:20:26] <%lumporr> i genuinely believe that the best way to enjoy pat's judgement streams is to look away for 30 minutes and come back and see what the fuck is happening
[0:20:29] <%RealThiele> take that children your sport is dominated by me, an old man
[0:20:32] <M0untain_wolf> Unstoppable!
[0:20:33] <%lumporr> it's been so crazy every time
[0:20:33] <%Felhad> Do a 900
[0:20:35] <%bustawof> yagami was truly a fellow kid
[0:20:38] <%astropupp> astropupp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 28 months! is time real?? the jury is out but i still adore y'all
[0:20:43] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Dang that old man has some fucking moves
[0:20:45] <%tigerfang86> HE'S DOING IT FOR THE CLOUT????
[0:20:47] <%Ancopro> eric sparrow travels to japan and only yagami can take him down
[0:20:48] <%DJFakie> What if there's a cameo from The Condor at the end of this minigame
[0:20:54] <Cynical2DD> @lumporr you are incredibly right
[0:20:59] <Ravingpyro> !uptime
[0:20:59] <Krisaeron> How much Pipes can Yagami Grind in Stopped Time?
[0:20:59] <@Moobot> @Ravingpyro I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 21m 14s.
[0:21:01] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What if you punched them a lot and then asked them questions?>
[0:21:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> is this the main story?
[0:21:20] <Treasure_Vault> Which one of these is the sugar baby?
[0:21:21] <Krisaeron> ye
[0:21:37] <+JustToWatch> Why is Yagami so good at literally everything?
[0:21:41] <%tigerfang86> look at that RELATIONSHIP CHART
[0:21:42] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> What the hell am I looking at??
[0:21:48] <%rekinom> Pat, are you a skater boy?
[0:21:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> whats going on with the robotics club?
[0:21:51] <%RealThiele> not appeaaling enough for dark sugar baby
[0:21:55] <%Felhad> Because this is Yagami
[0:21:59] <%RigmaroleHM> LUL This sounds so weird out of context
[0:22:08] <Krisaeron> I knew it was Maika!
[0:22:10] <Ravingpyro> oh my god KASAI?!
[0:22:15] <Krisaeron> She seemed so sus
[0:22:15] <@ssjklyco> She was the baby of sugars
[0:22:16] <%condemned_15> "Suggested Suger Babying"
[0:22:16] <M0untain_wolf> day what now?
[0:22:16] <+JustToWatch> ok but where does THAT MAN fit into all this
[0:22:19] <%rekinom> "Earned tuition by sugar babying"
[0:22:21] <%Ipsenscastle> According to this chart, Pat suggested Sugar babying :O
[0:22:21] <Treasure_Vault> I can't believe this is all connected to the murders
[0:22:21] <%Axellogic> you face blocked the baby
[0:22:28] <mighty_fine_trousers> Is the whole gang back?
[0:22:35] <cervidaequus> Did we kill kenta?
[0:22:36] <%condemned_15> Teras Kasi?
[0:22:50] <M0untain_wolf> Goons gonna goon
[0:23:04] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Why would anyone want to date a highschooler?
[0:23:07] <Krisaeron> Gr8 sk8 m8
[0:23:13] <%rbakervv> found out what skateboard coins are used for yet?
[0:23:13] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt did you already take care of Kasai?
[0:23:14] <Ravingpyro> *Skate soundtrack intensifies*
[0:23:24] <Alabyctor> holy crap! i didn't know the school sidequests is that long!
[0:23:30] <Krisaeron> School is Main Story in my heart
[0:23:37] <%RoggleJr> Fine I will.
[0:23:38] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> SK8 2 CRE8
[0:23:43] <%shurtal> fuckin' dude, IMAGINE if Kuze shows back up at some point
[0:23:52] <Treasure_Vault> Does the Judgement series follow the holistic detective method?
[0:23:56] <+toastybites> what murder?
[0:24:00] <DianaTheAscian> shocker
[0:24:00] <OneThousandTomatoes> sk8 points
[0:24:03] <%justcallmebobplease> There's going to be a point where it's impossible to 100% clear one of these games before the next comes out.
[0:24:07] <+vaderxyz1970> Yah but what if though
[0:24:07] <@ssjklyco> 80s
[0:24:07] <%shurtal> he could still kick ass
[0:24:08] <Cynical2DD> Oh my god the camera moves like Thrasher Skate and Destroy
[0:24:08] <DianaTheAscian> Kuza would be dead
[0:24:08] <MayShip> i honestly thought the story revolved around the school because it felt so long
[0:24:09] <+Tucker0603> as cool as this is I'm not buying a console for one game
[0:24:10] <%justcallmebobplease> They just keep getting bigger and not getting more spaced out.
[0:24:11] <Krisaeron> Pat, did you already get a gun?
[0:24:13] <DianaTheAscian> Kuze*
[0:24:16] <Ner234> As if that would stop him
[0:24:16] <+toastybites> isnt kuze forever in prison
[0:24:18] <%XzileGaming> Kuze shows up and goes "hell fellow kids"
[0:24:21] <%Ipsenscastle> this 40 year old skateboarding kung fu lawyer detective is pretty good
[0:24:21] <%castlerock42> Has age ever stopped anyone in this series?
[0:24:25] <%notsoy> there's several characters that hadn't stopped being badass despite being 70+
[0:24:26] <+JustToWatch> show us tha Gief
[0:24:31] <%MelBrooksKA> 80 year old Kuze could still probably kick ass
[0:24:32] <DianaTheAscian> He was in his 50s back in 0
[0:24:36] <%Monkeyweed21> Kuze was like 60 in the 80's he would be in his 90's at minimum
[0:24:36] <Blank9> I imagine Kazama had any 0 person that got put in jail murdered
[0:24:48] <Krisaeron> Kuze would kick the shit out of everyone
[0:24:49] <Blank9> because Kazama LOVES killing people
[0:24:50] <M0untain_wolf> Lol
[0:24:54] <%RealThiele> one day we'll just get a whole Yakuza thats japan wide with how nice they keep making these cities
[0:24:54] <DianaTheAscian> so he would be crazy old by now or dead
[0:24:54] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I'm so keen for 70 year old Kiriyu to be a cameo in a future Yakuza game
[0:24:56] <%shurtal> Kuze shows up in the diaper baby room
[0:24:58] <M0untain_wolf> poor paige
[0:25:02] <%ZephynM> I heard Elmo. psaElmo
[0:25:11] <+serasanomie> Being sugardaddy to a sugarbaby is like screaming at the clouds "I'm NOT having a mid-life crisis"
[0:25:17] <%MelBrooksKA> Kuze would kill all the highschool shit kids
[0:25:22] <OneThousandTomatoes> i like robots
[0:25:24] <+vaderxyz1970> What are those!
[0:25:29] <%shurtal> building a kill bot or a girlfriend bot?
[0:25:30] <Ravingpyro> wait this is Battle Bots?!
[0:25:30] <+JustToWatch> how does Yagami know robotics
[0:25:32] <%RealThiele> GIGA DRILL
[0:25:36] <%Kemmybelle> Now that the Switch is getting N64 games you have a perfect opportunity to play Banjo Kazooie. Kappa
[0:25:38] <%rbakervv> oh shit, robot wars!
[0:25:39] <M0untain_wolf> Battle bots
[0:25:40] <Krisaeron> What is this NERD stuff
[0:25:43] <mighty_fine_trousers> Wasn't Kuze in the mmo?
[0:25:47] <+dylin456> quick pat put the auto blow on the robot to absorb the hits
[0:25:49] <%MelBrooksKA> @shurtal Why not both
[0:25:49] <AthenaAegis> Oh GOD, it's the RC Car minigame all over again, isn't it? WutFace
[0:25:52] <cervidaequus> CRUSH GEAR 2021
[0:25:54] <%Ganerumo> That music sounds like Sims 2 music
[0:26:09] <DianaTheAscian> it really does
[0:26:10] <Krisaeron> oh no, robot death matches?!
[0:26:11] <%tactician0> what did you name your robot pat?
[0:26:15] <Krisaeron> in my Yakuziee!?
[0:26:16] <vonmaultke> This game looks amazing, too bad I don't own a console
[0:26:17] <ToneBacas> Medabots time?
[0:26:18] <OneThousandTomatoes> this is nostalgic
[0:26:18] <Treasure_Vault> Next stream start "Welcome to my space station unfortunately i don't know where to find more nuclear waste so the cloning bay is only level 8"
[0:26:24] <+mcjimbo12> @patstaresat remember when that chat friend said there was no way the other school clubs would have as much depth as the dance club that was a good time
[0:26:26] <DianaTheAscian> COOL
[0:26:28] <@ssjklyco> THERE'S BATTLE BOTS?
[0:26:30] <DusK_The_Stray> Yagamibot, so creative

[0:27:15] <Krisaeron> What is going on? Im so confused - what are the rules
[0:27:19] <@ssjklyco> Please tell me it's ran by the same guy from the Pocket racers?
[0:27:20] <%cvp5127> why is an adult competing?

[0:27:56] <MayShip> fuck them kids
[0:27:58] <Krisaeron> PogChamp
[0:28:04] <DSD24> Seems like Yagami lost his judgment
[0:28:05] <+trackles_64> to commit crime
[0:28:07] <+vaderxyz1970> If he never graduated highschool hes still a highschooler
[0:28:09] <%castlerock42> What is even happening here?
[0:28:10] <%notsoy> fuck them kids, that's why
[0:28:14] <%Profmcstevie> I shall earn their trust by GAMING
[0:28:16] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> This is Gundam, it's to teach the kids the horrors of war
[0:28:22] <ToneBacas> remember the part where Yagami was solving a case or something? nah, we're battle bots now
[0:28:22] <%RigmaroleHM> You're asserting your dominance to the immature children
[0:28:23] <OneThousandTomatoes> i did dobotics in school, it was very informative about war
[0:28:24] <Blank9> make all their robot displays say YOU SHALL BE AS GODS, it's your special power
[0:28:37] <Krisaeron> F
[0:28:38] <%Piemono> Is loosing the point of the game?

[0:29:42] <+toastybites> what a boomer
[0:29:45] <%ZephynM> I was almost hoping the character would be extra-melodramatic about losing.
[0:29:46] <DSD24> Yagami died
[0:29:47] <%twistedj3ster> why is an adult losing to kids?
[0:29:50] <%Ipsenscastle> SplaTRON
[0:29:51] <DusK_The_Stray> That loss killed you?
[0:29:53] <@Ranryu692> Robots fighting with tetrominos? I feel like Woolie might like that

[0:30:20] <@OfficioPrefectusCorgi> Ask Gene

[0:30:24] <aura_00> @ZephynM nothing will beat Kiryu losing in pocket racer though
[0:30:26] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt focus on claiming enemy squares instead of neutral squares
[0:30:36] <%chiazam> I’m gonna cry this is great
[0:30:43] <OneThousandTomatoes> you pay a lot for stuff that gives you a very small advantage
[0:30:46] <%DJFakie> CyricZ will save us all

[0:31:01] <%bustawof> I was kinda hoping the robotics would play like Front Mission 3
[0:31:01] <OneThousandTomatoes> one of the rules of robotics competitios
[0:31:04] <%bustawof> LUL
[0:31:09] <DusK_The_Stray> This really is just roboSplatoon

[0:31:27] <%MoguManda> if only they could move diagonally
[0:31:55] <%chiazam> Can you box them in?

[0:49:06] <+vaderxyz1970> SO IF YOU WANT TO 100% YOU HAVE TO MASTER VF5!?!?!
[0:49:10] <ohno778> Pat has played VF 5 before
[0:49:14] <televisedrevolting> @ghosrevan I think it's one of his favorite fighting games.
[0:49:19] <Cynical2DD> Imagine if Pat gets a perfect and the game thinks he’s cheating
[0:49:19] <Pt_Kamen> does this game have Cabacura?
[0:49:20] <Dova573> Yagami feels more like  Jackie or Blaze main
[0:49:20] <Sulfur_Boride> Is it preferable to play VF on controller or stick?
[0:49:21] <%DJFakie> Do you feel like Ultimate Showdown warmed you up for this
[0:49:28] <ToneBacas> are you proud?
[0:49:29] <Blank9> I hope they go to other games and you have to competitively play Sonic Fighters
[0:49:30] <Krisaeron> Pat will get his ass kicked even harder in this than robotics club

[0:49:38] <Saltmeisterr> WRES
[0:49:39] <Treasure_Vault> Lost Judgement singlehandedly revives VF
[0:49:40] <Zeif00> Segeta Sanshiro died for our sins
[0:49:40] <mr_sups> If you lose a match, one of the kids should go "I don't make it a habit of Fighting the Eldery!"
[0:49:41] <%cvp5127> wow they programmed a fake fighting game LUL

[0:50:23] <+LittleCinders> SEGETA!
[0:50:26] <fIashman92> He got a fish eye lens shot, like Segata
[0:50:26] <%bustawof> those bushes are undeniable
[0:50:28] <+MauriceFaurron> look it up
[0:50:29] <%JoshManVGH> That is JUST Segata Shanchrio, for sure

[0:51:13] <+Tucker0603> @cynical2dd never had a Saturn my first console was a PS1

[0:52:24] <+kewlmyc> We believe you, dude
[0:52:24] <SaltyAzteca> HOW COULD THEY KNOW
[0:52:24] <missingangle> Holy shit the volume on that hair
[0:52:25] <+MauriceFaurron> people don't know who Segata Sanshiro is ?
[0:52:27] <fIashman92> It's his son from those commercials
[0:52:28] <Krisaeron> [ REALITY AT RISK ]
[0:52:30] <+vaderxyz1970> So many thumbnails to make
[0:52:30] <%RealThiele> ehh
[0:52:30] <tentavision> WHY IS THIS HAIR SO BIG
[0:52:32] <%barrakuta371> Not the best picture, but i see it
[0:52:32] <%Mr_Pylon> The closeup earlier shows it the best
[0:52:34] <DSD24> Didn't Segata marry Sakura from Sakura Wars?
[0:52:36] <@Spydurman> who is he?
[0:52:37] <+JustToWatch> it's the crease between the eyebrows that really sells it
[0:52:38] <%JoshManVGH> Segata!!!
[0:52:38] <%RazielPrime> I thought Segata right when you first paused it on him!
[0:52:39] <+CherteuseKapibara> majinoHorror
[0:52:39] <+LittleCinders> Love you Segata
[0:52:41] <ghosrevan> they totally did this on purpose
[0:52:41] <Cynical2DD> A 20 year old shouldn’t know what a Saturn is but here we are
[0:52:42] <%Ynkubus_> The guy who played Segata was also Kamen Rider 1
[0:52:44] <%twistedj3ster> I have facial blindness, I'll take your word for it
[0:52:52] <draca23> Are you prepared to get your ass kicked for not owning a Saturn, Yagami!?
[0:52:53] <LoreKeeper_Thal> he's Kamen Rider Ichigo!
[0:52:55] <%andrewofbob> A marketing character
[0:52:55] <%condemned_15> His son is a Bishi Boi
[0:52:55] <Cynical2DD> @patstaresat just play a commercial for people to understand
[0:52:56] <ErikFeral> It's the guy who continues to fight Chuck Norris in the stars from Death Battle!!!!!!
[0:53:02] <Zeif00> I could only hope to have such powerful eyebrows
[0:53:03] <%andrewofbob> He's in Project X Zone 2
[0:53:07] <%JoshManVGH> His sons name is just Sega Shiro
[0:53:07] <DianaTheAscian> Cool
[0:53:09] <mike2hands> LEYEND
[0:53:14] <marvel877> His son from the commercials looks like a bishoujo manga love interest
[0:53:16] <SaltyAzteca> ErikFeral is right
[0:53:18] <Enajy314> limesPoggers
[0:53:19] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I can't believe Kamen Rider beat up kids
[0:53:21] <televisedrevolting> @twistedj3ster Are you the villain from 999 or tired of people making 999 jokes?
[0:53:21] <%Qsmash_> to be clear Segata Sanshiro is a fictional character
[0:53:23] <ErikFeral> First Kamen Raider is a BIG achievement
[0:53:24] <%MashinChaserR> he's also married to the protag of the sakura wars games
[0:53:25] <@Ranryu692> so he's cool William Shatner?
[0:53:35] <%condemned_15> Rider KICK
[0:53:46] <Dova573> lol
[0:53:46] <Cynical2DD> He is Japan’s Chuck Norris
[0:53:46] <OneThousandTomatoes> wait
[0:53:47] <%baka_sugoi> I can see Segata bein in the FGC
[0:53:50] <+MauriceFaurron> William Shatner isn't cool ? Kappa
[0:53:51] <Pt_Kamen> GAMERS RISE UP
[0:53:56] <%shootbang_exe> I wonder if the name sanbonmatsu is a reference to anything
[0:53:56] <SaltyAzteca> Oppressed Group of all....GAMERS
[0:53:58] <%JoshManVGH> I did not know he was the first Kamen rider though, that's super cool!
[0:54:11] <mr_sups> "With the glass ceiling broken..."
[0:54:11] <ErikFeral> @SaltyAzteca Thanks! My years of trivial knowledge from VS matchups is paying off
[0:54:14] <%trackles_64> ITs the press
[0:54:16] <OneThousandTomatoes> I want to see what some other streamers unfamiliar with fighting games did there
[0:54:22] <ghosrevan> NEEEERD
[0:54:26] <Blank9> is this the VF esports announcement?
[0:54:37] <Dova573> I wonder if the final boss is Kazunoko
[0:54:37] <%condemned_15> "Folow the money"
[0:54:38] <%Agami23> push ups and sit ups? they should be doing squats like real gamers
[0:54:44] <Krisaeron> NEWS: Local School GAMERS caught DOPING
[0:54:53] <+CherteuseKapibara> actual boomer bias
[0:54:57] <%baka_sugoi> watch it dose LUL
[0:54:58] <LoreKeeper_Thal> balls exposed on stream
[0:54:59] <Cynical2DD> I can’t wait to watch next week’s episode of Kamen Rider Star Force Wonder Brigade, but I should go to bed.
[0:55:01] <fIashman92> Just flip kick
[0:55:03] <%DJFakie> You gonna practice with Max?
[0:55:11] <OneThousandTomatoes> ainwaz trained on pro players
[0:55:12] <+vaderxyz1970> How bad do you want top 8?
[0:55:13] <%Agami23> imagine an alt timeline where virtua fighter is the street fighter of games
[0:55:13] <%MisterRockett> I'm bad at VF and I hope they do.
[0:55:14] <@Ranryu692> OR they have to get good to get those cheevos, and then they get into fighting games
[0:55:17] <OneThousandTomatoes> nobody will win
[0:55:19] <%castlerock42> They will absolutely get hard. Yakuza difficulty doesn't fuck around.
[0:55:25] <%Rumbutt> Get into Fighting Games: Lost Judgement
[0:55:30] <MayShip> this is a mystery game?
[0:55:35] <%solracc25> Embrace the dead Virtua Fighter as a side story club
[0:55:37] <Treasure_Vault> This IS investigating the murder!
[0:55:42] <+LandOfTheWay> "hey sawa, still bad at your job?"
[0:55:43] <%Mr_Pylon> Gotta investigate that pro gamer getting murdered in VF5
[0:55:43] <+vaderxyz1970> oh no the murder......Anyway
[0:55:44] <%G_Thunders> How long are most Yakuza games? I’ve never played one
[0:55:44] <ghosrevan> who cares play virtual fighter
[0:55:50] <%chiazam> Pat the final boss of that quest line will just be the highest difficulty CPU, just spam to win
[0:55:50] <%SaiyanShoto> Japan fucking loves VF, there’s weekly tournament streams of VF5 from Japan
[0:55:52] <ErikFeral> pfft, we all know the sidequests exist in HyperTime.
[0:56:02] <OneThousandTomatoes> if only there was a game about getting into fighting games, particularly vf5, too bad that doesn't exist
[0:56:02] <%trackles_64> You know
[0:56:02] <%ThomasOfTroy> She 100% was fucking Mikoshiba
[0:56:04] <+MauriceFaurron> eSports club is pretty quick to do tho, you gotta play like 4 matches
[0:56:14] <%MashinChaserR> bury your head in the sand simulator

[0:56:50] <%Ipsenscastle> they made him play Balan Wonderworld before they finished him off
[0:56:52] <ohno778> y the fuck you lyin..

[0:57:35] <DSD24> Take a look at THIS
[0:57:36] <%castlerock42> That's not what he asked.

[0:59:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Me neither
[0:59:55] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Just kids being kids man
[0:59:56] <+Mrbaconator> that is cartoonish
[0:59:57] <Blank9> so yeah, guess it's good he died
[0:59:58] <%notsoy> he deserved being tortured to death
[1:00:00] <ohno778> Mikoshiba was a piece of shit
[1:00:02] <+vaderxyz1970> And the Schools Complicate
[1:00:04] <@Ranryu692> "Boys will be boys"
[1:00:06] <%castlerock42> Hard to believe the sexual harasser is a fucking scumbag.
[1:00:09] <%Ipsenscastle> then they ate his cereal and pissed in his plants
[1:00:15] <Treasure_Vault> The important part is that "I" shouldn't kill people.
[1:00:16] <%JoshManVGH> "Fuck you Video Game! You can't make me feel things!"
[1:00:17] <%solracc25> Yeezuz
[1:00:21] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> No it's not
[1:00:27] <+Tucker0603> that guy shouldn't have been killed......but he should have his legs broken
[1:00:27] <%valriot> This is a Yakuza game
[1:00:28] <Ravingpyro> no. no it's not.
[1:00:29] <%twistedj3ster> IT IS NOT
[1:00:30] <missingangle> It's really not.
[1:00:31] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Like Chris Rock said: Im not saying he should've killed em........but I understand
[1:00:32] <%tigerfang86> This is shit people do
[1:00:32] <%castlerock42> Same.
[1:00:35] <%solracc25> Trash of trash human being
[1:00:37] <%MoguManda> it's pretty realistic
[1:00:38] <%MashinChaserR> imagine thinking this doesn't happen
[1:00:39] <%baka_sugoi> bruh
[1:00:40] <%ThomasOfTroy> The breaking into his mom's house is what I think over does it
[1:00:42] <Dova573> Its not cartoonish
[1:00:44] <KnivesEve> i could see this happening
[1:00:45] <%MoguManda> kids are awful
[1:00:45] <Krisaeron> Seems like Baconator did not get bullied in school
[1:00:46] <ghosrevan> humans are pretty garbage
[1:00:47] <%arizenarkana> Look up Wrestler's Court. This shit happens to adults too.
[1:00:47] <+Mrbaconator> I don't mean to say i didn't believe it or it's not realistic i say cartoonish as in at a certain level of awful @PatStaresAt
[1:00:47] <%Rumbutt> yeah if you say this is cartoonish than you were lucky to not be bullied
[1:00:47] <Sulfur_Boride> "Kids are cruel, Jack"
[1:00:49] <DXLelouch24> bacon your a fool and im callin you out on discord
[1:00:49] <%strakillias> "I feel bad about this kid that got bullied and killed himself so I'm going to defend his bully to the death. Even after both of them are dead"-- This fuckin bitch P.S. yeah this is how it be for some of us
[1:00:50] <Krisaeron> Ir he WAS the bully!
[1:00:52] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Nah I've seen equally messed up stuff in School, kids are just that bad sometimes
[1:00:52] <%Mr_Pylon> Bullies escalate until something happens
[1:00:55] <ghosrevan> espically tennagers
[1:00:57] <Maids4lyfe> worse than boys will be boys
[1:00:59] <Treasure_Vault> People do crazy shit when their empathy doesn't exist
[1:00:59] <%tigerfang86> FUCK THAT TEACHER TOO AAAAAAAA
[1:00:59] <Sunstalker> What about the Beyond 2 Soulds bullying?
[1:01:01] <DSD24> God damn it
[1:01:03] <%livlinn> yeeeeaaaah.... jeebus shiaCry
[1:01:05] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> This is pretty on-par with normal high school stuff
[1:01:05] <DSD24> Its the same shit again
[1:01:09] <%chiazam> Yeah that shit is real, Like WAY too real
[1:01:14] <ohno778> like moustache curling evil
[1:01:17] <%TourettesPlays> Reminder that anyone under the age of 25 is by  definition a Sociopath
[1:01:17] <%notsoy> this comes from the house of Yakuza, this isn't even the worst human being they've ever made
[1:01:18] <+Mrbaconator> @PatStaresAt No I can see how it can come across as the other way.
[1:01:19] <DSD24> "Oh they are gonna graduate!"
[1:01:29] <%solracc25> Fuck evidence
[1:01:30] <+KnifeyMcEdge> GHOSTS
[1:01:32] <+Kyma1020> it's systemic as fuck
[1:01:35] <$Ziegsy> kids used to follow me home from school and bounce basketball off the back of my head. same kids also set fire to my uniform in engineering class and played it off as a welding accident
[1:01:35] <%strakillias> NO SHE DIDN"T TRY
[1:01:37] <%tigerfang86> "but THEIR FUTURES"
[1:01:39] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Just look at the case of the kids in the US where the judge said "I wouldn't want to ruin his life" after he assaulted someone
[1:01:41] <%notsoy> Yakuza has had worse people as villains lol
[1:01:44] <@Spydurman> And yet she still does NOTHING to bullies. Like ones with bats attacking you
[1:01:44] <%tigerfang86> "Their SCUMBAG FUTURES THO"
[1:01:45] <ohno778> did she tho?
[1:01:45] <SaltyAzteca> you either get beat up or learn to fight back. shits fucked out there man

[1:02:16] <Treasure_Vault> must have been real short
[1:02:17] <%PhantomMiG> Thats an Epstein hanging

[1:02:21] <%livlinn> it's pretty popular way shiaFeels
[1:02:25] <+vaderxyz1970> Im now hoping this game ends the same as the first one ending sequence with these abusers
[1:02:27] <%ThomasOfTroy> Ohh, over the top of the door, tied to the door knob
[1:02:27] <@Spydurman> BUT YOU BLOCKED HIM AT EVERY TURN
[1:02:35] <StaceMcGate> I just tuned in, is Lost Judgment primarily about schools?
[1:02:39] <%G_Thunders> She probably meant from the other side of the door

[1:03:06] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:03:06] <DianaTheAscian> Wow
[1:03:09] <%Ipsenscastle> @Ziegsy amen
[1:03:10] <Cal_ixo> yup that sounds about right
[1:03:10] <%arizenarkana> American Vandal shit
[1:03:12] <%shootbang_exe> hope that dude got fired
[1:03:14] <%strakillias> This teacher sounds like every teacher that thinks they did their best to fight bullying but actually did nothing.
[1:03:14] <Krisaeron> Teachers are scumbags
[1:03:16] <%castlerock42> Oh, come on, man. At least try to not be a dirtbag of a teacher.
[1:03:17] <@Ranryu692> the victim confessed to you, why didn't you come forward yourself lady?
[1:03:19] <Blank9> @StaceMcGate Yes, but tied into vigilante stuff in general too.
[1:03:20] <%condemned_15> sounds like HR at Blizzard
[1:03:21] <%angryoptimist> So, like, they only "got back" 3 questionaires?
[1:03:22] <@Ranryu692> *confided in you
[1:03:24] <%chiazam> WHOOOOOOO
[1:03:26] <Ravingpyro> who was that teacher? i just wanna "talk..."
[1:03:27] <%Monkeyweed21> @shootbang_exe he had tenure
[1:03:28] <+Tucker0603> @ballerswagbro9k well fuck
[1:03:32] <%tigerfang86> can we KICK THIS TEACHER IN THE SKULL
[1:03:40] <+RSNoon> jesus christ
[1:03:46] <Cal_ixo> teachers are the final bullies
[1:03:48] <Dova573> So the teacher is next to be found dead right?
[1:03:49] <radregice> geez
[1:03:52] <Krisaeron> AFTER THIS - BACK TO SKATEBOARD PLS, This is too real and sad
[1:03:54] <%BlackStarAura> God damn
[1:03:54] <%solracc25> THIS SCHOOL IS POISON, BURN IT DOWN
[1:03:54] <%baka_sugoi> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:03:54] <%trackles_64> this is some heavy shit
[1:03:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FUCK
[1:03:55] <willsin4fun> was he excuse really she tried"
[1:03:59] <%tank7013> ALL GRADES?
[1:04:00] <SaltyAzteca> Soon chat. Soon. Hold that anger.
[1:04:01] <LoreKeeper_Thal> probably actual facts
[1:04:03] <%livlinn> oof
[1:04:05] <Treasure_Vault> i thought she was gonna say every day
[1:04:09] <%castlerock42> Less than 3%? I have questions.
[1:04:12] <%barrakuta371> Japan suicide rate is absurdly high
[1:04:13] <ToneBacas> mental health problems in any form, really
[1:04:20] <%polothegreatest> fit in, or will make you
[1:04:21] <Krisaeron> First Graders commit suicide too?
[1:04:23] <+vaderxyz1970> I can only wonder why?
[1:04:24] <%Ipsenscastle> 50,000 children are eaten by bats every day
[1:04:24] <%condemned_15> mental healthcare is stigmatized in Japanese culture
[1:04:25] <punks55> damn this game's serious parts are serious
[1:04:26] <%chiazam> “We investigated ourselves AND FOUND NO WRONGDOING”
[1:04:27] <@Ranryu692> an unfortunate effect of glorifying it for a while
[1:04:27] <%TourettesPlays> Maybe the guarantee of spending your life working 80+ hours a week has something to do with that
[1:04:29] <%tigerfang86> FUCK OFFFFF
[1:04:32] <Blank9> less than 3% of suicide of schoolchildren linked to bullying is even more absurd than the 99% conviction rate
[1:04:35] <ghosrevan> This got really heavy really quickly
[1:04:37] <Maids4lyfe> they just sweep it under the rug and ignore it, psychology and psychiatry is a joke in that country
[1:04:40] <+mcjimbo12> so this is definitely the REALest the serious part of these games has ever been, right
[1:04:45] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> In the US that number is 6k
[1:04:47] <+mcjimbo12> like jesus man
[1:04:48] <%strakillias> and it apparently worked
[1:04:48] <devanmuse> Let me guess: That teacher is now the Chairman of the school?
[1:04:50] <Maids4lyfe> yeah
[1:04:50] <%JoshManVGH> Man... making these games about normal people instead of superhuman criminals is... heavy.
[1:04:53] <%trackles_64> can we arrest them now?
[1:04:55] <%JoshManVGH> I love it
[1:05:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gotta say the way RGG can balance drama and goofy shit is fucking masterful
[1:05:04] <%DJFakie> What a coincidence that Futaba's VA is voicing this character
[1:05:08] <%solracc25> And you didn't do anything
[1:05:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Best i ever seen
[1:05:12] <punks55> this hits different than most rgg gmaes
[1:05:13] <Ravingpyro> christ...
[1:05:17] <%chiazam> What did they do
[1:05:19] <%castlerock42> Pat, are you sure you want most of the lighthearted stuff off camera?
[1:05:21] <+Mrbaconator> man lost judgement goes hard
[1:05:26] <ghosrevan> Can we beat up the teachers now?
[1:05:27] <Cal_ixo> Ok she did try
[1:05:29] <Maids4lyfe> this fucking hurts
[1:05:31] <%angryoptimist> If you did that with those questionnaires... wouldn't that be super duper illegal?  Destroying or hiding evidence?
[1:05:33] <+vaderxyz1970> Is this the heaviest the series has gotten if not its feels pretty darn close
[1:05:38] <Pt_Kamen> There is no such thing as mental illness in Japan
[1:05:40] <%baka_sugoi> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:05:42] <%twistedj3ster> I'm tearing up...
[1:05:43] <%TourettesPlays> Japan is more like "Innocent until WE Prove you Guilty"
[1:05:46] <DianaTheAscian> Its very impressive
[1:05:49] <%tank7013> @mcjimbo12 Nah serious parts get pretty serious across all games. Like there's a character that went blind from the drama of being used as a sex slave
[1:05:51] <%tigerfang86> bepSad
[1:05:52] <Cal_ixo> empathy x1000
[1:05:53] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah these games have next level facial animation
[1:05:53] <+Plus_On_Black> This scene is done so well.
[1:05:58] <%tank7013> @mcjimbo12 trauma*
[1:06:00] <$Ziegsy> i remember being blown away when the eyes moves in ffx
[1:06:03] <Krisaeron> Hooooo boy, I need a drink
[1:06:08] <colzack_> Yeah it seems like she was the only one trying to help and literally everyone else was shutting down her attempts
[1:06:11] <%SaiyanShoto> You think he’s thinking of playing VF5 right now?
[1:06:12] <%solracc25> ya didn't do anyhting
[1:06:16] <%strakillias> "What else could I do?" Asks woman who could have not lied in court
[1:06:26] <@Ranryu692> what a missed opportunity to say "lectern"
[1:06:26] <%livlinn> lucidCringe
[1:06:28] <%TourettesPlays> it blew my mind in Half Life when the scientists mouths moved when they spoke
[1:06:28] <%Mr_Pylon> oh man did she tell Ehara?
[1:06:33] <radregice> the modeled the entire aqueous humor
[1:06:34] <Maids4lyfe> vividCri
[1:06:36] <Cal_ixo> rapid eye movement is nuts
[1:06:37] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Yeah it hits hard, sometimes bad people end up being successful and not needing to answer for their deeds
[1:06:39] <punks55> oh no not a money cutscene
[1:06:48] <%OrangeMDT> I mean, you could blame him tho
[1:06:56] <%MisterRockett> POP
[1:07:00] <%chiazam> Maybe Ehara did it with no solid evidence
[1:07:04] <Krisaeron> Fwoosh...

[1:07:08] <DSD24> Ouch

[1:07:11] <Krisaeron> OOOOOOF
[1:07:13] <Treasure_Vault> Where did he go?
[1:07:14] <Pt_Kamen> the biggest "SIN" in Japan is breaking social peace. Lie, suicide, drink if you must
[1:07:22] <%livlinn> woolieDATTEBAYO
[1:07:23] <%tigerfang86> that's FUCKED
[1:07:26] <Ravingpyro> fuck
[1:07:28] <%ThomasOfTroy> Yeah, that's not much of a miracle
[1:07:29] <Krisaeron> Bullies need to get their knees broken
[1:07:31] <%MidnightBurst12> oof
[1:07:33] <Treasure_Vault> This is probably not important for the overarching plot
[1:07:33] <DSD24> God damn it
[1:07:34] <%solracc25> Bruh and you didn't learn from that lady?
[1:07:37] <DianaTheAscian> Fuck
[1:07:37] <Maids4lyfe> @Pt_Kamen yep
[1:07:37] <%trackles_64> fuck this is ti real
[1:07:40] <Cal_ixo> I blame superman
[1:07:43] <%angryoptimist> A peace without justice isn't peace, though.

[1:08:07] <+Mrbaconator> man this english VA knocks it out the fucking park
[1:08:10] <Dova573> Man do I have no sympathy for teacher who enable Bullying
[1:08:11] <Pt_Kamen> If you're in court you've already broken social peace, you're guilty (even if only of that)
[1:08:21] <%castlerock42> Responsibility through torture, though.
[1:08:22] <Cal_ixo> awwww
[1:08:23] <%arizenarkana> I appreciate the game intentionally oversimplifying the solution before hitting you with the hard truth.
[1:08:27] <mighty_fine_trousers> Wait so who was the homeroom teacher?
[1:08:28] <PlaidisTheNewPlaid> Yup, you sure did
[1:08:30] <Ravingpyro> jesus fuck
[1:08:31] <@Ranryu692> this is an RGG game, I'm not ruling out an 11th hour plot twist that exonerates him
[1:08:31] <Maids4lyfe> No wonder Japan has like the lowest happiness rating of its populace
[1:08:33] <%tank7013> And even after all that tried to cover for him post mortem
[1:08:37] <%Xevtes> no wonder truck-kun is so popular in manga. everyone wants out of japan's fucked society
[1:08:37] <$Ziegsy> Good. she SHOULD cry
[1:08:39] <%livlinn> too real lucidHands
[1:08:44] <%Ipsenscastle> that's good cry acting

[1:08:58] <KohryuZX> Going to guess she's the Fuyutsuki stand in
[1:08:59] <p_e_a_x> I´m surprised she didn´t get shot
[1:09:02] <colzack_> Voice acting in this is insanely good
[1:09:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YUP PROBABLY
[1:09:05] <+Mrbaconator> it's so extremely real
[1:09:06] <%shurtal> can WE murder him?
[1:09:06] <+genepark> Nice the dub crying is also really good
[1:09:09] <%solracc25> Can we go back to dance club?
[1:09:09] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> I hope so
[1:09:10] <%strakillias> Yes you did let it happen. How can you care enough to cry over it but not enough to tell someone
[1:09:11] <ghosrevan> maybe the cop got him too?
[1:09:12] <%angryoptimist> Time to heat action some guys?
[1:09:14] <punks55> i just wanted fun goofy rgg
[1:09:14] <Blank9> someone had to have seen it happen at least once
[1:09:16] <%polothegreatest> someone squeal
[1:09:21] <+Mrbaconator> can we dig mikoshiba up and murder him a 2nd time
[1:09:23] <@Ranryu692> the teacher is probably actually in prison, hence the dad getting himself arrested
[1:09:23] <+genepark> The Japanese track was super sad too
[1:09:25] <Pt_Kamen> imagine the suicide numbers in Japan if there was no manga/anime and hentai
[1:09:26] <@Spydurman> will his body be the mid-Act twist? While Ehara is still in prison or something?
[1:09:26] <%twistedj3ster> let's wait and see instead of investigating
[1:09:30] <+JustToWatch> oh yeah we're definitely gonna meet them at some point
[1:09:32] <%Monkeyweed21> oh man i hope so
[1:09:34] <devanmuse> Wow, I was expecting her story to end with "And that enabling teacher is now the chairman of the school" for maximum bullshit
[1:09:37] <fIashman92> This is making me sad. Go back to the happy stuff.
[1:09:41] <%ahomeschooldropout> I'm starting to root for the killer tbh
[1:09:45] <%twistedj3ster> oh look, a UFO
[1:09:45] <Zeif00> Are we going to have to save an asshole?
[1:09:51] <DXLelouch24> man playing Arise and watching this in the same day is wierd, cause Erica Lindbeck voices both Shionne and Sawa
[1:09:55] <@Ranryu692> it's a unique skill they have
[1:09:56] <ghosrevan> they are great writers
[1:09:57] <%Monkeyweed21> tonal whiplash seems more accurate
[1:10:01] <+wmeldrum> metal gear?
[1:10:03] <%castlerock42> It's gotta be two seperate teams.
[1:10:06] <%MrMegaJackpots> mgs?
[1:10:07] <Krisaeron> Persona?
[1:10:11] <Treasure_Vault> Deadly Premonition?
[1:10:12] <MrGuy516> and it still is fucking great
[1:10:16] <%livlinn> Can We gO to A SidEqUesT pLeSe??? psaWhat
[1:10:17] <%tigerfang86> Metal Gear is ALWAYS serious but zany
[1:10:22] <Krisaeron> Danganronpa?
[1:10:22] <%baka_sugoi> politicaly weird
[1:10:29] <mr_sups> The "Yakuza is a serious crime Drama" Meme
[1:10:30] <Dova573> is we counting manga Ill say One piece comes close
[1:10:31] <@Spydurman> "Discover the Sugar Baby is the dance club!" also "Here's a story of someone bullied into suicide . . ."
[1:10:31] <%Mr_Pylon> Complete clownshoes
[1:10:33] <+pupil31> True
[1:10:33] <SaltyAzteca> from goofy to real in 10 seconds flat
[1:10:34] <%Xevtes> @Xevtes its super fucked
[1:10:34] <+Mrbaconator> metal gear doesn't go from child suicide to lets help this monkey drive a construction vehicle
[1:10:36] <%solracc25> Dice and Cube
[1:10:36] <%MisterRockett> I feel like it's because it's more player driven to engage with the zany stuff.
[1:10:37] <%baka_sugoi> so WILD shit
[1:10:41] <%angryoptimist> Dangonronpa does swing pretty wildly.
[1:10:45] <devanmuse> One game ago you fought a GIANT ROOMBA
[1:10:48] <Ner234> Whole ass Circus
[1:10:52] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its Masterfully done
[1:10:53] <%Monkeyweed21> You swap between Soap Opera and 4koma from minute to minute
[1:10:54] <draca23> I think it is because there's at least a brief moment of time before switching the tone super hard
[1:10:55] <DXLelouch24> Yakuza is some goofballs but it has legit serious sthi in it
[1:10:58] <%arizenarkana> Absurdity and tragedy aren't that far from each other.
[1:10:58] <$Ziegsy> Shadow hearts. Solving murders and war crimes to taking part in wrestling matches
[1:11:00] <%MisterRockett> Even the fighting system is more player driven and separate from the narrative stuff.
[1:11:00] <+JustToWatch> Deadly Premonition does get up there
[1:11:01] <%shurtal> the ichiban speach at the end was preceded by a chicken doing a shareholder meeting
[1:11:01] <DXLelouch24> stuff*
[1:11:02] <ToneBacas> and neither end of the tonal spectrum down-plays the other
[1:11:03] <AthenaAegis> Like "Be My Baby" Kappa
[1:11:04] <Dova573> Yeah I feel thats apt for One pIece
[1:11:05] <%castlerock42> Or the writers are just really good at detaching themselves.
[1:11:05] <DianaTheAscian> We just from gamers rise up to some very real shit
[1:11:07] <%tigerfang86> time for MARIO PARTY
[1:11:09] <%angryoptimist> I love that about Yakuza/Judgement.
[1:11:16] <mr_sups> @MisterRockett Probably
[1:11:17] <%trackles_64> we to poor
[1:11:18] <%Mr_Pylon> If there was a Yakuza sub story involving a man flatening himself against a painted tunnel it wouldn't be out of place
[1:11:20] <%strakillias> The giant roomba fight canonically occurred in this same town around this same time.
[1:11:20] <shameimarusen> the goofy stuff makes the serious stuff hit harder I think
[1:11:22] <cervidaequus> Coin locker baby into chimpanzee in a bulldozer
[1:11:23] <%TourettesPlays> Considering these are like 40+ hour games tons of tonal shifts in the story aren't that unreasonable
[1:11:23] <%tank7013> You go from your brother trying to kill you to save you from torture to betting on half naked women cat fighting
[1:11:23] <%livlinn> oh psaWhat
[1:11:24] <%akscully> they keep them contained within themselves really well
[1:11:27] <+Proxzo> It's the ability to que the player to when it is "Serious time" and when it is "silly fun time"
[1:11:30] <%Ipsenscastle> why are the Looney Tunes called Tunes and not Looney Toons?
[1:11:30] <Zeif00> It's not afraid to be a video game
[1:11:35] <%baka_sugoi> NEKOS woolieGASM
[1:11:36] <+JustToWatch> that's why you need the crime fighting dog
[1:11:39] <@Ranryu692> fucking LUL
[1:11:44] <%livlinn> wooooo psaGib psaWink psaBlep psaPorgmo psaElmo
[1:11:45] <Krisaeron> Oh, please lets just all remember Mister Shakedown, or MISTER LIBIDO
[1:11:47] <+Proxzo> They teach you when things are gonna be serious with music and such.
[1:11:51] <%chiazam> You are not a clown, you are the ENTIRE circus
[1:11:53] <%solracc25> psaBig sad
[1:11:54] <%condemned_15> i wish you could skitch on cars
[1:11:55] <+mcjimbo12> There has to be a Serious Team and a Dumb Bullshit team, right? Do you think each even knows the other exists?
[1:11:57] <%megadblitz> that "wooo haha" is a good example
[1:12:00] <%Monkeyweed21> Yakuza has 3 modes: Soap Opera, Crime Drama, and gag 4koma
[1:12:01] <TheFramedWarlock> The RGG series is insane because literally every game is stellar and the series is yearly
[1:12:04] <+LandOfTheWay> yeah that tracks
[1:12:05] <LoreKeeper_Thal> YEYEYEY ACE COMBA
[1:12:06] <+ekodrop> so what do those skateboarding medals do?
[1:12:13] <DSD24> "Did you know that there's three kinds of aces?"
[1:12:14] <%Xevtes> @Ipsenscastle stronger copyright by changing the spelling to something more unique
[1:12:15] <Ner234> CAT
[1:12:16] <%angryoptimist> @Krisaeron the STRONGEST ORGANISM
[1:12:18] <%Axellogic> So did they give Yagami the skateboard specfically so he'd come off as more try hard with the kids?
[1:12:20] <%solracc25> yes pat
[1:12:20] <MayShip> ugly cat
[1:12:21] <ErikFeral> psaDab Ace Combat and Yakuza: Wacky, yet Sincere.

[1:12:31] <%notsoy> that was 5000 points? jesus
[1:12:32] <%baka_sugoi> PRINCESS woolieGASM
[1:12:34] <+genepark> Mmm that’s true. Ace combat is so harrowing and ridiculous
[1:12:35] <%tigerfang86> that cat gave you a POTION
[1:12:36] <%angryoptimist> That cat has weird eyes.
[1:12:38] <%polothegreatest> psaJpeg
[1:12:38] <@ssjklyco> Not Immunity?
[1:12:39] <+Proxzo> A game's ability to teach you which mode they want you to be in, is why this stuff can work.
[1:12:42] <+CherteuseKapibara> what a trade
[1:12:43] <+CAPSLOCKlive> That cat offered you diplomacy
[1:12:43] <%castlerock42> I forgot about fucking Pawpularity.
[1:12:46] <%akscully> no snideness about the stories
[1:12:48] <%terrible35> Diplocat
[1:12:49] <mighty_fine_trousers> We always choose violence though don't we?
[1:12:50] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> It's super aware of itself as a franchise, Ace Combat knows the weirdness of Melodrama over Butt-rock whilst pulling kulbits at mach 3
[1:12:52] <%vivaldiva> psaJpeg
[1:12:55] <%shurtal> is diplomatic solution a euphamism for like, pouring boiling water on a guy?
[1:13:05] <Krisaeron> If yagami does not adopt every single cat he made friends with during the game - I SWEAR TO GOD
[1:13:07] <+pupil31> LUL

[1:13:23] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Sick recovery Yagami
[1:13:23] <Ner234> He's fine don't worry
[1:13:23] <Blank9> I feel like not many other open world games put as much wildly different personality in their open world vs main story
[1:13:26] <%livlinn> IT'S FINE
[1:13:32] <%Archphronimos> the Fallout games have some serious tonal dissonance
[1:13:34] <devanmuse> that man is dead
[1:13:35] <Ner234> DEAD
[1:13:38] <%tank7013> Man I will never get tired of that heat move
[1:13:44] <%solracc25> ouch
[1:13:51] <%PhantomMiG> @patstaresat Every Yakuza game I am 100% sure that the writer is sincere on any of the topics. It very humanizing because both extremes good and bad exist in life
[1:14:01] <%Agami23> so did they fix swan style or whatever its called?
[1:14:06] <%livlinn> suplex at first sight joofbUWU

[1:14:24] <devanmuse> Didn't Judgment One have a mechanic where the cops would get called on you if you got into too many random battles?
[1:14:25] <%Monkeyweed21> cuz of the CIA and the twins and all that dumb shit
[1:14:25] <%akscully> dope as hell

[1:25:49] <%MisterRockett> It's really funny.
[1:25:50] <ghosrevan> lawyers are terryfying
[1:25:51] <%Piemono> He's something worse than a Yakuza
[1:25:52] <Archmortal> 99% conviction rate
[1:25:54] <%BlackStarAura> lmao
[1:25:56] <SaltyAzteca> lawyers are like the IRS im sure
[1:25:57] <V0LK__> that's japanese criminal system for you tho

[1:26:04] <%TourettesPlays> Does conflict of interest just not exist in Japan or what?  a lawyer can't sue people he is actively beating up
[1:26:07] <Krisaeron> WE'LL SELL YOU!

[1:26:26] <Sulfur_Boride> *lawyer
[1:26:31] <tanarath> Because he's basically a cop, Pat. He can say whatever and fuck someone's life.
[1:26:32] <%Puhff> Yakuza will beat you up but a lawyer will get you thrown in JAIL
[1:26:38] <mighty_fine_trousers> lol so those guys are getting sued anyways
[1:26:39] <%megadblitz> oh no this is that yakuza 0 majima mission, THEY'VE RUN AWAY AGAIN

[1:54:35] <Maids4lyfe> Pat's 35
[1:54:38] <Krisaeron> Save 10% on your car insurance with Tesso!
[1:54:39] <%twistedj3ster> Kuwana reminds me of someone and I don't know who
[1:54:40] <%Monkeyweed21> @Krisaeron nah Kriyu also has that heat move, along with the one where you disarm a guy and unload his pistol into his chest
[1:54:42] <blackjack8182> This is just persona music!
[1:54:48] <%rbakervv> i bet masked guys are going to show up on the street as random fights
[1:54:50] <+JustToWatch> to be fair cool scars make you look older
[1:54:53] <%Dakuu75> I feel like "Tesso" is a dumb name... but, I still like it.
[1:54:56] <%chiazam> @patstaresat I have to ask, after 6 games of Kiryu being a freak-beast who crushed any enemy in front of him, why does anyone in Yakuza 6 who knows him try to fight him
[1:55:03] <%livlinn> OhMyDog
[1:55:04] <%stubborndeer> You killed that shaolin monk
[1:55:06] <Maids4lyfe> LUL
[1:55:11] <SaltyAzteca> that poor man
[1:55:11] <%MidnightBurst12> Ded
[1:55:11] <%Axellogic> I mean Tesso is ratman
[1:55:13] <StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt just curious who your least favorite antagonist is in the Yakuza games (apart from Daigo)
[1:55:26] <%stubborndeer> That sholin monk will never fuck with the streets again
[1:55:31] <%BlackStarAura> they were probably hired by those shitty bully kids
[1:55:31] <%Mr_Pylon> Also he's an old man
[1:55:33] <@ssjklyco> And 4
[1:55:36] <%Dakuu75> Jokes on them, lol
[1:55:37] <%baka_sugoi> but Kiryu
[1:55:41] <DSD24> "So your saying there's a chance?"
[1:55:42] <%Ganerumo> Might as well just be hazing, like you're new you gotta go get your ass kicked by kyriu
[1:55:44] <DianaTheAscian> Hes also old by then
[1:55:47] <DXLelouch24> and it didnt work
[1:55:54] <Blank9> meanwhile in 2, kiryu gets stabbed with a poison knife and less than a day later fistfights 2 tigers
[1:55:55] <%twistedj3ster> then he shouted One Piece existed
[1:56:01] <$Ziegsy> ahh the gladiator approach
[1:56:03] <Krisaeron> @Monkeyweed21 Okay, yeah, i remember, and fair point, BUT counterpoint - they wear bulletproof vests and knife only goes into the gut - they have time to get to the hospital and get drink StaminaX
[1:56:06] <%Dakuu75> LMAO~!!!!! (of course it is)
[1:56:09] <StaceMcGate> Kiryu could apply for social security by Yakuza 5
[1:56:12] <ghosrevan> kiryu is an immortal god
[1:56:17] <%MashinChaserR> aren't there rival freak beasts all over the place too?

[1:56:46] <Sulfur_Boride> Shoutout to Black Panther 2's opening theme.
[1:56:51] <%baka_sugoi> Also a whole CLAN after Kiryu too
[1:56:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> i missed the last 15 or so minutes, what happened?
[1:57:13] <%stubborndeer> kiryu beat up like ten shoilin monks
[1:57:17] <fIashman92> Does it explain why everyone in 3 is also an asshole?
[1:57:18] <StaceMcGate> still Kiryu defeated 100 tojo goons by himself, you'd think some people would recognize him
[1:57:20] <%chiazam> I’ve never heard of this Black Panther
[1:57:23] <Blank9> meanwhile black panther has 12 minute fights against 5 whole grunts in the parking lot, and they're just high school gang members
[1:57:26] <%stubborndeer> and then daigo said he was cool
[1:57:34] <%rbakervv> @OneThousandTomatoes masked gang jumped yagami, got asses kicked

[1:57:47] <%Monkeyweed21> @Krisaeron yea they just need to go to a restaraunt and eat a meal, Kiryu's just supporting local businesses
[1:57:55] <blackjack8182> Isn’t Yagami famous after the whole Alzheimers scandal in the first game?
[1:58:03] <%chiazam> noooooo
[1:58:06] <SaltyAzteca> WE GOT Jebaited

[2:05:09] <Maids4lyfe> or Omi
[2:05:10] <%megadblitz> @Dakuu75 i mean if one finger is badly injured, the whole hand feels pain even if its just the pinky

[2:37:38] <blackjack8182> Shapeshifting
[2:37:43] <%stubborndeer> Isn't that nintendos director of sales
[2:37:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Hes probably dead
[2:37:45] <Treasure_Vault> Not gonna get that chat, I think
[2:37:45] <%A_Zealous_Retort> different moles?
[2:37:48] <%Mr_Pylon> Ehara playing 5 d chess
[2:37:49] <OneThousandTomatoes> check the height
[2:37:49] <UrsulaPrinze> This game looks really good by the way.
[2:37:51] <cervidaequus> Is this SECRET AMERICAN FBI TWINS again
[2:37:52] <Ardailec> Does Japan have Double Jeapordy?

[2:37:58] <%baka_sugoi> god damn this case
[2:37:58] <Blank9> RED KNIFE
[2:37:59] <MechanizedGentleman> thats not what double jeopardy is
[2:38:00] <UrsulaPrinze> I like how the office is designed.
[2:38:02] <%Monkeyweed21> THIS IS JUST LUKE ATMEY'S PLAN
[2:38:03] <@Ranryu692> that's not what Double Jeopardy is
[2:38:04] <%notsoy> isn't double jeopardy just not being able to be tried for the same crime twice?
[2:38:09] <%Mekhet09> Does japan have double jeopardy
[2:38:10] <%Mr_Pylon> I FORGOT ABOUT MIRROR FACE
[2:38:14] <%twistedj3ster> I actually don't like this, since there's only a few explanations
[2:38:21] <auraoftheearth009> Not double jeopardy though...
[2:38:21] <%tigerfang86> OH SHIT MIRROR FACE
[2:38:30] <%stubborndeer> Double jepoardy is when both sides turn out to know the defendant
[2:38:31] <Ardailec> Mirror face is a thing...
[2:38:34] <%stubborndeer> so you can't have a trial
[2:38:36] <%Dakuu75> gimmy the play-by-play Narrator-Man~
[2:38:37] <blackjack8182> It’s the Chameleon! Stop him Spider-Man!

[2:38:45] <%baka_sugoi> DOUBLE JEPORDY
[2:38:46] <SaltyAzteca> BLACK CAT! BAD LUCK!
[2:38:47] <%twistedj3ster> Bahahaha
[2:38:50] <%condemned_15> IT WAS THE CAT
[2:38:52] <Admiral_PopnFresh> That was SUCH a good pop off
[2:38:52] <%chiazam> LAST TIME ON LOST JUDGMENT
[2:38:55] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt this is just the second case from Trails and Tribulations
[2:38:59] <%stubborndeer> the only time the FBI can legally enter a court room without a warrant etc
[2:39:01] <UrsulaPrinze> Black Cats are good luck.
[2:39:01] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> I can't imagine getting throat slit is a super quick death as well, shit's rough
[2:39:04] <%Maids4lyfe> he deserved it though bullies don't stop until they're stopped
[2:39:11] <ghosrevan> black cat means something bad is gonna happen probabbly
[2:39:12] <DXLelouch24> Pat what if its Mirror Face, hes been established so its possible
[2:39:13] <DianaTheAscian> OH IT WAS POSTED
[2:39:17] <thelonechris> Nobody watches TV anymore
[2:39:21] <%TourettesPlays> oh god they have to watch the snuff tape over and over again like they're Naughty Dog devs, poor guys
[2:39:22] <+CherteuseKapibara> *dude just trust me*
[2:39:24] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Redditors, amr?
[2:39:33] <%Maids4lyfe> lol
[2:39:38] <DianaTheAscian> I haven't watched TV in years
[2:39:48] <%TourettesPlays> oh shit this is Rising Sun
[2:39:50] <@Ranryu692> I like the word "facsimile"
[2:39:51] <%Mekhet09> To be fair, he deserved it.
[2:39:54] <%topendbuzza> no never
[2:39:55] <EternalJedi> ruuKek
[2:39:55] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[2:39:56] <%Piemono> That wasn't a deep fake
[2:39:56] <%tank7013> Tsukumo I have bad news
[2:39:57] <CrypticMochi> Would Ehara even lose even if Yagami solves this?
[2:39:57] <%notsoy> nah, he was probably just saying crazy stuff?
[2:39:58] <TheSinner42> no that was real
[2:40:00] <%stubborndeer> ISn't that Segas director of sales
[2:40:00] <%twistedj3ster> that wasn't fake
[2:40:00] <ghosrevan> UHHHHHH
[2:40:03] <%Dakuu75> chaos control
[2:40:09] <Meltoras12> No the president was actually saying crazy stuff
[2:40:10] <DusK_The_Stray> Tsukumo, no...
[2:40:11] <%topendbuzza> the usa pez would never say something crazy
[2:40:14] <DianaTheAscian> That was real sadly
[2:40:23] <$SGrim> Then run checks on the subwat footage
[2:40:28] <%livlinn> are they calling out the DAMEDANE meme lucidLurk
[2:40:28] <$SGrim> subway*
[2:40:28] <KnivesEve> has to be twins
[2:40:29] <JustAnotherTrapArtist> Oh yeah, we're getting into the real techno-Dystopia now
[2:40:29] <ghosrevan> i wish i lived in the yakuza reality
[2:40:33] <%BlackStarAura> roll that beautiful bread footage
[2:40:40] <+Kyma1020> Maybe he was referring to the Obama deep fake
[2:40:46] <@Ranryu692> damn you Express VPN!
[2:40:54] <thelonechris> It was the hacker known as 4chan
[2:41:06] <%zarkazeon> if they assume the video is real couldn't they line up the light from the windows for a more exact time of death? destroying the time diffrence for his allibi?
[2:41:07] <%baka_sugoi> oh god
[2:41:11] <Admiral_PopnFresh> ...like the Yokohama police...
[2:41:13] <%Dakuu75> ...
[2:41:14] <+kewlmyc> It was all thanks to NordVPN
[2:41:28] <$Ziegsy> those masks look like the bad guy in the first mask movie
[2:41:31] <%angryoptimist> Just buy the traffic flow data that ISPs are selling.  Apparently you can get people through their VPNs with that now.
[2:41:35] <mike2hands> he's gonna be super dead, i can smell it
[2:41:35] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @kewlmyc Internet Historian is that you?
[2:41:36] <SaltyAzteca> Missing info, but what
[2:41:39] <%chiazam> Why not just get away with murder WHY GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE
[2:41:43] <blackjack8182> It was made after he was arrested?
[2:41:48] <%Axellogic> Heres a thought what if this is all a ruse to fix the broken justice system?
[2:41:55] <DianaTheAscian> This video is sponsored by squarespace
[2:42:00] <walaladun> Its for double jeopardy right?
[2:42:05] <%condemned_15> You think the lady was in on it?
[2:42:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ehara is super dead
[2:42:18] <fIashman92> twin brother lets go
[2:42:23] <%zarkazeon> exactly pat
[2:42:24] <walaladun> sending the video is like victory lap for Ehara
[2:42:24] <%Mekhet09> I think that's too obvious.
[2:42:26] <DianaTheAscian> yeah thats possible
[2:42:29] <$OranHexthief> yakuza games are never that simple pat
[2:42:34] <@Spydurman> what if he froze the body for like a week or something?
[2:42:35] <Ardailec> Only way you could manipulate time of death (assuming the coroner is honest) is freezing the corpse though
[2:42:36] <%tank7013> Update that autopsy report Miles
[2:42:37] <%A_Zealous_Retort> body killed then put on ice then thawed later to alter the predicted time of death?
[2:42:41] <%baka_sugoi> EX DDT
[2:42:43] <CatRidder> or a stand did it
[2:42:43] <ghosrevan> I think an ally is definitely on the plot
[2:42:44] <blackjack8182> @dianatheascian Or Audible
[2:42:51] <+Catpurnicus> mirror face got called in for one last job
[2:42:55] <$Ziegsy> freezing burns, you can tell
[2:43:00] <DusK_The_Stray> It never stops amusing me how you can just DDT someone in the middle of the street.
[2:43:03] <DianaTheAscian> @blackjack8182 LUL
[2:43:06] <MechanizedGentleman> my bike! WutFace
[2:43:08] <%Dakuu75> Dude, all of these moves look like Fatalities. I love it.
[2:43:13] <%castlerock42> Here's my question. If Eihara wanted to establish an alibi, then why make a fucking video of you doing the deed?
[2:43:13] <OneThousandTomatoes> the real question is who let the flares while he was in prison
[2:43:15] <DusK_The_Stray> It looks like you start the fight by just murdering someone in broad daylight.
[2:43:20] <walaladun> anyway Ehara is dangerously based
[2:43:23] <%akscully> always love the music chang
[2:43:33] <%BlackStarAura> eat that bike fat boy
[2:43:34] <ghosrevan> Pat is there any side missions right now?
[2:43:46] <%zarkazeon> no. they got t.o.d. from food in his stomach which even the police guy says someone could have forced him to eat
[2:43:52] <%chiazam> So how long until that guy the RK Gang was looking for becomes vital to the main case?
[2:44:14] <ExpressNode> Watching this on my new PC I built. Have to say the visual quality is actually astonishing.

[2:51:40] <+Zollington> deep fake
[2:51:42] <%baka_sugoi> FAKE MURDER
[2:51:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> how convenient
[2:51:46] <%solracc25> it does
[2:51:48] <%BlackStarAura> DOUBLE JEOPARDY
[2:51:51] <@Spydurman> he froze the body and left it to unfrost

[2:52:10] <%Nekros4442> LOOK AT THIS EDGEWORTH MFER
[2:52:11] <+kewlmyc> Mirror Face is legit one of the dumbest plot points I've seen in Yakuza. Not the top, but it's up there.
[2:52:23] <DusK_The_Stray> He looks like he's SUPER in on it, hahah
[2:52:39] <Sulfur_Boride> @kewlmyc Your top's the rubber bullets, isn't it?
[2:52:55] <@Spydurman> If I was on a jury I'd convict him for murder, "perfect alibi" or not
[2:52:59] <%solracc25> that's not just "some video"
[2:53:09] <%topendbuzza> cops are IN ON IT
[2:53:12] <akitanito> No jury in japan tho
[2:53:14] <scarman125> why don't we just kill him? problem solved.
[2:53:16] <%FunkyStreams> FunkyStreams subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months! Just heard this song called 'Wild Anthem', on a album called 'Anthem', by a band called 'Anthem'. It's a Japanese heavy metal band... These guys have a serious anthem. I thought you should know.
[2:53:18] <Sp3ctre48> I don't know if anything can be as bad as rubber bullets
[2:53:18] <Zombrocom> I dunno, I think YAMATO MK 2 beats rubber bullets
[2:53:34] <+kewlmyc> @Sulfur_Boride You know me so well
[2:53:36] <%condemned_15> fucking dinosaur country
[2:53:49] <SaltyAzteca> This is a damned situation, come ooon
[2:53:49] <%angryoptimist> I mean, none of this is real.
[2:53:51] <%tigerfang86> ACAB
[2:53:56] <blackjack8182> @sp3ctre48 Locker baby switch up in 7
[2:53:57] <Archmortal> if people start to doubt the 99% conviction rate that'd be bad
[2:53:58] <DianaTheAscian> thats a phrase
[2:54:01] <%tigerfang86> what if he was a CLONE
[2:54:07] <ghosrevan> What if he telaported
[2:54:09] <+CherteuseKapibara> magical koreans
[2:54:12] <%Mr_Pylon> What if he had a secret Korean twin?
[2:54:15] <%baka_sugoi> CRIME
[2:54:16] <@Ranryu692> magic? in this world of glowing martial artists? never
[2:54:17] <thelonechris> I'm not sure there's a conviction for wizardry
[2:54:22] <%condemned_15> that would be funny as hell
[2:54:24] <%G_Thunders> Teleporting clone
[2:54:26] <%solracc25> Looks like that video used NORD VPN to hide its data
[2:54:28] <%BubbaRands> what if he was SUPER fast
[2:54:28] <Meltoras12> What if it is Wendigos?
[2:54:33] <+thegonzo1> so whoever said this was all a setup to make the system look bad was right I think
[2:54:34] <%tigerfang86> Kaito's having a great time
[2:54:34] <Sp3ctre48> @blackjack8182 eh nah
[2:54:36] <SaltyAzteca> POWER OF FRIENDSHIP
[2:54:37] <%Mekhet09> He's going to die.
[2:54:41] <Blank9> thanks Claude
[2:54:44] <+JustToWatch> what if it was his stand
[2:54:55] <%BubbaRands> What if he had a portal gun?
[2:54:56] <%chiazam> Seriously, I’m really interested to learn what Ehara is getting out of this
[2:54:57] <+kewlmyc> yet another GETTING CAPTURED WAS PART OF MY PLAN villain
[2:55:09] <%topendbuzza> did it?
[2:55:24] <%greasypete00> wait so are you trying to clear him of the murder or get him convicted of it or get him convicted of the sexual assault
[2:55:25] <%livlinn> woolieOMG
[2:55:26] <%tigerfang86> @chiazam he gets to avenge his son's suicide at least
[2:55:26] <+kewlmyc> Kaito horny nonstop
[2:55:27] <SaltyAzteca> oh they fuckin?
[2:55:28] <%Deft_Thought> Bro, this is a Yakuza-universe game. You're gonna be played like a fool until the 98% mark.
[2:55:30] <DusK_The_Stray> Kaito seriously doesn't waste time
[2:55:36] <ghosrevan> jesus just get together or not
[2:55:36] <%Monkeyweed21> I HAVE A NEW GIRL TO BANG AND SHE TEACHES
[2:55:36] <%MelBrooksKA> Was that Makoto's VA?

[2:55:48] <thelonechris> He's super fucking dead
[2:55:48] <+kewlmyc> @SaltyAzteca 1st game says they were at one point
[2:55:49] <Blank9> it's not like that, I'm busy dating 4 girls at the same time in sidequests
[2:55:49] <@Spydurman> convict him for 10 years for sexual assault, figure the murder out later
[2:55:49] <%baka_sugoi> oh NO
[2:55:50] <mike2hands> called it
[2:55:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Knew it

[2:55:59] <Sp3ctre48> I-It's not like that guys, we're just friends
[2:56:00] <%solracc25> Eihara being police makes it not that far fetched that some police was in on it.
[2:56:00] <scarman125> fucking called it
[2:56:01] <%Mekhet09> He's totally dead.
[2:56:02] <DianaTheAscian> was*

[2:56:33] <%Piemen99> HE MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD
[2:56:39] <Meltoras12> I mean, what were they expecting?
[2:56:51] <%tigerfang86> COPS ARE DIRTY???
[2:56:52] <DianaTheAscian> Of coarse its planned
[2:56:54] <%tigerfang86> WHAT THE???!?!?!?
[2:56:55] <Zeif00> Fuck everybody I guess
[2:57:02] <Sp3ctre48> ain't it always a conspiracy
[2:57:03] <ghosrevan> EVERY GAME IS A CONSPIRICY
[2:57:08] <Blank9> I mean judgement was a huge conspiracy
[2:57:10] <%solracc25> Don't inmates have no rights?
[2:57:13] <thelonechris> I guess you could say it's Lost Judgement
[2:57:14] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Cops can't be dirty....
[2:57:25] <%Axellogic> I'm still on the train that Ehara is trying to demolish the entire court system
[2:57:25] <%MisterRockett> Eat Fresh
[2:57:33] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Subway? Nah Taco Bell
[2:57:34] <akitanito> lady's probably a cop

[2:57:41] <%A_Zealous_Retort> is the real one even in custody
[2:57:45] <%MashinChaserR> but you can always trust the cops huggBarkley
[2:57:45] <DXLelouch24> Mirror Face was the groper
[2:57:47] <Zombrocom> He has to be, he got arrested and went straight to custody
[2:57:48] <Sp3ctre48> I mean...probably the groping
[2:57:51] <+thegonzo1> or BOTH???!
[2:57:56] <%baka_sugoi> COLLUSION
[2:58:05] <%solracc25> X doubt
[2:58:10] <@Spydurman> what if the woman had done nothing?
[2:58:14] <thelonechris> What the fuck are these Purge dudes?
[2:58:15] <%A_Zealous_Retort> no it wasnt
[2:58:28] <Blank9> was the person that was groped in on it
[2:58:36] <%A_Zealous_Retort> dude you were there when we found the gap in the footage
[2:58:55] <+vaderxyz1970> The one part I don't get is that if they never showed the body none of this would be happening. Why?
[2:58:56] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[2:58:59] <Sulfur_Boride> I almost gotta respect the level of commitment it takes to tank your whole reputation for an alibi.
[2:59:43] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt it was pulled down when he groped her
[2:59:45] <%tigerfang86> big yes
[2:59:47] <ghosrevan> MIRROR FACE

[3:00:18] <%baka_sugoi> they can do that?
[3:00:26] <+kewlmyc> A REALISTIC LOOKING GLOVE
[3:00:28] <@Ranryu692> I think she was the woman who threatened the teacher in the cafe
[3:00:31] <ghosrevan> could she be in on it?
[3:00:33] <%chiazam> they can do that
[3:00:35] <akitanito> you mean he groped her every day until the last day
[3:00:46] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Mami's mammies

[3:01:42] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I'm willing to bet she's in on it
[3:01:43] <fIashman92> Bet is her son is bullied or something, and she's in on it

[3:30:04] <+bigbeefkeith> @Saltmeisterr I dunno, just doesn't seem as interesting or well polished as Like a Dragon did
[3:30:05] <%baronblank> this seems late in the game to unlock easy mode based on what I've seen
[3:30:06] <%colzack_> You can check in the pause menu what difficulty your on
[3:30:14] <shotgang86> so easy mode is now selectable
[3:30:31] <tenaciousp445> just like Sam Fisher woulda done
[3:30:34] <Aoworth> It's never too late to diap up
[3:31:00] <Aoworth> :)
[3:31:01] <AzureDragoonGX1> revenge mofo
[3:31:11] <%Mekhet09> He should still be kicking your asss.
[3:31:16] <+ReallyBigRocks> I can think of a few situations where it's too late to diap up
[3:31:18] <%Mekhet09> Like that's dumb.
[3:31:26] <AzureDragoonGX1> Ooop, disguise off
[3:31:34] <Sp3ctre48> @bigbeefkeith I mean, I prefer Like a Dragon with it being an rpg but this is still a quality game
[3:31:35] <@Ranryu692> WAS HE WEARING HIS CLOTHES UNDER THE OTHER GUY'S CLOTHES??
[3:31:36] <MarlooRedd> is "diap up" really a new phrase?
[3:31:40] <tenaciousp445> oh ang 1%er disses
[3:31:41] <@Ranryu692> DID HE GO BACK TO CHANGE?
[3:31:52] <+ReallyBigRocks> it is now

[3:32:04] <Sp3ctre48> oh no, not the boys we beat up already
[3:32:04] <akitanito> why does he look like the rainmaker
[3:32:05] <%Dakuu75> man... that guy wears ginger, bad.
[3:32:25] <+JustToWatch> @pepzi_boyz yeah
[3:32:28] <tenaciousp445> he looks like yakuza Conan O'Brian
[3:32:54] <V0LK__> we can rule this city together spiderman!
[3:33:07] <%MashinChaserR> Conan Ohara
[3:33:16] <MayShip> just don't do crime dummy
[3:33:25] <%baronblank> I couldn't get into yakuza 0 after getting up through chapter 4 but I liked yakuza 7 a lot so I assume I wouldn't like this or judgment one as much. Does that seem reasonable?
[3:33:34] <%solracc25> If kiryu couldn't get out...
[3:33:53] <%XzileGaming> Dwanye the Rock Johnson?
[3:33:55] <@Ranryu692> I think I would have liked Judgment a lot more if Kaito had been the main character
[3:33:59] <+ReallyBigRocks> anakin skywalker
[3:34:06] <%Deft_Thought> You gotta be one bad motherfucker to talk to a dude with a neck like that
[3:34:11] <ExpressNode> When did he change back?
[3:34:15] <%solracc25> who...
[3:34:28] <Sp3ctre48> @baronblank If what bothered you about 0 was the gameplay then you might have the same issue here, though the gameplay is better

[3:35:02] <Aoworth> You know this isn't a serious fight because the shirts are still on
[3:35:02] <%Deft_Thought> I like Kaito a lot more than Kiryu
[3:35:02] <@Ranryu692> Yagami fought a guy with knife hands like, yesterday
[3:35:03] <+ScrapKingKeita> KANEDAAAAA
[3:35:05] <SaltyAzteca> KANEDAAAAAAAAAAA

[4:03:40] <AngryAsian5> Not only did you make her relive that trauma, you showed her a suspected snuff film too. LUL
[4:03:41] <%greasypete00> needed to interrogate the boy

[4:03:47] <%stubborndeer> Something later may tie in with what she said I can't ruin anything
[4:03:53] <V0LK__> did you fail successfully or that was the right/only outcome?
[4:03:53] <%Ancopro> she aint a corroborator at least
[4:03:54] <%baka_sugoi> used child as bargaining tool
[4:03:55] <%tank7013> We found out that the video has to be fake because she was... Really sure?
[4:03:58] <+vaderxyz1970> You got an excuse for that women to be murdered in the future
[4:03:59] <OneThousandTomatoes> @baronblank people were calling out pat for forgetting the entire reason they were there
[4:04:06] <%G_Thunders> You successfully made her relive her trauma
[4:04:06] <%chiazam> No, now you KNOW that he was definitely at the station
[4:04:27] <fIashman92> If she really never lost sight of him, then it confirms the video is fake
[4:04:35] <%baronblank> @OneThousandTomatoes Oh I see, left for a bit and came in late so that's fair
[4:04:39] <%baka_sugoi> cuz size
[4:04:44] <OneThousandTomatoes> y7 was the same
