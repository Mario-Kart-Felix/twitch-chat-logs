[0:51:43] <+cheezy_snackz> did they just forget he lived there?
[0:51:44] <%bigboy3d> How come Joe doesn't get infected, isn't the mold airborne? Or maybe it's just RE silliness
[0:51:44] <rytisone> no, the other side is completely contaminated
[0:51:45] <+nirvana227> monkaS
[0:51:46] <Hydrapissed> I mean is she dying or is she gana get cool powers to

[0:52:07] <Mr_Strut> Very lazy gators
[0:52:08] <Hydrapissed> GATOR no
[0:52:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, how did these people build a wall and base less than a quarter mile from his house and Joe Baker had absolutely no idea it was happening?
[0:52:09] <mrjellyfish877> Aww beans. I came in at the very end, didn't I?
[0:52:11] <%BoxNavy> DansGame
[0:52:12] <CrimsonFox777> You'll be safe, right next to the mutant gator.
[0:52:13] <+michingmallecho> GATORS BITCHES BETTER BE USING JIMMIES
[0:52:20] <%Shadicara> Stay here Zoeh I'm gonna go smash some Gaterz
[0:52:21] <Saltmeisterr> fucking love gators
[0:52:21] <+scrumbotime> Gators the size of crocs! UNTHINKABLE
[0:52:26] <benjiFG> i believe there's an effigy where you first saw the gator
[0:52:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Just lie here, right next to the gator infested water.
[0:52:27] <Saltmeisterr> they just big dogs
[0:52:30] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Why do virus in women make hot?
[0:52:30] <boomstickery> so shovelly jack wants to hit that crystal zoe?
[0:52:31] <%patriotrenegade> Gators are just that big
[0:52:32] <%RueOrin> "You'll be safe here... 10 feet from the gator."
[0:52:32] <$raziel391> Antique gator
[0:52:33] <%sweetpotatokingwow> so men turn into molded women turn into shiva from FF
[0:52:34] <owensleftfoot> aaawww
[0:52:41] <+Kairi__> gator + mold = crocodile
[0:52:41] <ThDark> Gators can get that big, I live in Florida
[0:52:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> Joe Baker can absolutely punch normal gators tho.
[0:52:45] <+JordantheKitty> i do think it's funny that regular gators are far more dangerous than the molded
[0:52:46] <calamarvelous> Wet scaly mold dogs
[0:52:51] <Hydrapissed> god HAND 2
[0:52:52] <Aydarkzero> i wonder if stealth kills come back in re8

[0:53:04] <+Kairi__> knife run BAYBEE
[0:53:06] <vectorspyke1> Leon! Remember the basics of CQC!
[0:53:06] <penitentpentwitch> Krauser fight would be more interesting
[0:53:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> @JordantheKitty The gators in this game aren't regular, they're all molden gators
[0:53:08] <Aydarkzero> i just hope the knife doesn't have a durability bar
[0:53:10] <Hellarussian> look at this jabroni NPC
[0:53:11] <crassplay_> I just want an RE Engine remake of RE1, I am so upset
[0:53:14] <+evbites> @bigboy3d evie no longer exist so the mold is now just goo or joe could just be super resistant
[0:53:17] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @StebTheVee because it's next. They did 1-3
[0:53:18] <+RayDaug> Krauser is just Vergil

[1:00:32] <%MassConnect> Paige just doesn't realize how much stuff punches because Pat is soooo good at RE games.
[1:00:34] <heartlesshealer> Pat stares at Paige's big adventure
[1:00:38] <indig0bird> Was the Super Smash one or the drunk one?

[1:00:52] <%elicoy> How dare you
[1:00:53] <boomstickery> That drunk Paige audio is the best because she claims peach wants her to drink water because she's nice but when Pat tries to help her it's because hes a adick
[1:01:00] <SomeOtherNeb> @cowardman93 T

[1:18:28] <+akira_chong> RE7 isn't my favorite RE game, nor would I say it's the most RE-feeling game in the main series, but it's a super-fun platform for a whole bunch of game genres from survival horror to Metroidvania shooter to first-person beat-'em-up to escape room simulator to Call of Duty: Nazi Zombies clone. It's wild.

[1:55:11] <chambatron> Dogs eat way too much and end up puking if you don't stop them
[1:55:11] <%barrakuta371> Yeah some dogs won't free feed. They'll just eat anything in front of them.
[1:55:17] <+scrumbotime> If you feed him too much he will grow too much and you will end up with a dog bigger than you are

[1:57:46] <%RyTYoung> that would be sick
[1:57:47] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp
[1:57:47] <MrDonTacos_> Pog
[1:57:51] <%D00msDayDan> ooo
[1:57:51] <+deedubbelyuu> MGSV makes me sad
[1:57:53] <%Agami23> use mods to break that games online apart
[1:57:53] <+captain_elsewhere> goddamnit i forgot what other monster in resi uses that gator scream
[1:57:53] <%QuesoFM> thats why i asked
[1:57:54] <thetroubless> do it that would rock

[1:57:55] <+denmonari> DO IT
[1:57:56] <%LegendGHT> wha I thought you did
[1:57:58] <+Regigangster> WHAT
[1:57:58] <%RyTYoung> Was it Liam hands on the whole time?
[1:57:58] <xxmagonx> Do it
[1:57:58] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt if you do it, would u go loud or sneaky?
[1:57:58] <Gallhint> its underwhelming
[1:57:59] <%mike2hands> psaDogchamp
[1:57:59] <%DappercatEsquire> WHAT ABOUT METAL GEAR SURVIVE?
[1:58:00] <Dr_Mooose> hmm
[1:58:01] <xanerts> do it
[1:58:02] <+Regigangster> PLAY IT
[1:58:02] <bigshedman> Wait you never played it for yourself after the LP?!
[1:58:02] <%GarbageNirvana> the PS3 version finally got rid of all its nukes
[1:58:02] <%RueOrin> It's pretty good.
[1:58:03] <+Pharmakokinetic> MGSV is a great GAME... it's just a bad Metal Gear as far as plot goes
[1:58:04] <%mike2hands> yeeeeh do it
[1:58:04] <boomstickery> omg yes
[1:58:04] <+evbites> that sucks
[1:58:07] <thetroubless> PogChamp
[1:58:08] <%LegendGHT> it's fun to play
[1:58:09] <%bigboy3d> MGSV is much better when you know the story is disapointing
[1:58:10] <@commanderclaw> MGSV is a good game and a bad movie
[1:58:12] <+Kairi__> it's fun to play
[1:58:12] <+ConLin_Arts_> isn't it kinda long though?
[1:58:12] <rytisone> play it when it's done
[1:58:13] <+Arkfyre> greatest soldier in the world
[1:58:14] <Aydarkzero> @PatStaresAt would you start w/ Ground Zeroes for continuity or just jump into 5?
[1:58:15] <Tooniearcade> Do it
[1:58:15] <%a_goth_pancake> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[1:58:16] <+captain_elsewhere> theres a lot of mods wich reduce the torture
[1:58:16] <penitentpentwitch> The enforced PVP element in that game killed it for me
[1:58:18] <+dmtjinni> wot???
[1:58:18] <boomstickery> i reinstalled it yesterday its so good
[1:58:18] <%ClericOfSparda> psaDogchamp
[1:58:22] <wakeupsuper12> I bought the game day 1 and still couldnt play it
[1:58:22] <%barrakuta371> It was mostly Liam for the LP
[1:58:34] <%afronooch> should play it. Its great. Story is eh, but game is solid
[1:58:36] <+scrumbotime> So if you use the spears to clear the paths of gators and unlock areas, would you call them crockpicks?
[1:58:36] <%RyTYoung> The tapes are very good
[1:58:39] <+dmtjinni> gameplay 10/10, story whatever/10
[1:58:44] <boomstickery> you guys really really needed to listen to the tapes
[1:58:44] <+ConLin_Arts_> Gun Jumper Liam!
[1:58:46] <%Tman451> The Tapes are GREAT
[1:58:48] <%LegendGHT> I still think it's a fun game
[1:58:50] <cephas97> do it
[1:58:52] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> it's a great stealth action game
[1:58:52] <%a_goth_pancake> DD, slit that motherfuckers throat! *bork* üî™
[1:58:52] <boomstickery> you had no real context
[1:58:53] <%ClutchRoadagain> Would it be Grounds Zero then MGSV if you were to stream?
[1:58:54] <%MassConnect> I never played it because no David Hayter
[1:58:55] <%GarbageNirvana> it's kind of funny looking back listening to this tape you can tell which ones were meant to be cutscenes
[1:58:56] <Dr_Mooose> best part is the gameplay
[1:58:57] <%DappercatEsquire> Play all the MGS game in lead up to the next pachinko machine
[1:58:57] <%BillyMaze> Excited for Resident Evil: Refrigerator?
[1:58:57] <danpc5> the gameplay is really good
[1:59:08] <+Kairi__> Ghost of Tsushima reminds me A LOT about Phantom Pain
[1:59:09] <+ConLin_Arts_> the only tape I really know is the Burger one that Zone likes
[1:59:10] <%saadi90> The tapes are fantastic
[1:59:14] <%QuesoFM> yeah u talked about it on twitter, thats why i was curious
[1:59:16] <%RyTYoung> oh yeah I saw that
[1:59:18] <%NovaKnightmare> THASTS LITERALLY ALL OF MGS THO
[1:59:20] <StaticSunrise> it mgsv was more than 30% done it would be an amazing game
[1:59:22] <boomstickery> the tapes are the most MGS thing about it, you kept saying you wanted more dialogue and it was all in the tapes
[1:59:22] <%NovaKnightmare> EVERY SINGLE ONE
[1:59:23] <StebTheVee> decent at best
[1:59:25] <suddenlyscorched> If you use something to open both a door and a beer it's a bockpick
[1:59:28] <+Regigangster> 5 is AMAZING! even with the botched production
[1:59:31] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[1:59:32] <%suikudo> MGSV is actually fun to play
[1:59:36] <xanerts> that video is a little weird
[1:59:38] <doctor_deadbeat> at least play 3 too?
[1:59:41] <%ClutchRoadagain> baby bathtime
[1:59:42] <LordOfThePoultry> poop all over LUL
[1:59:44] <Dova573> I mean the story is kinda unfinished but I enjoyed playing the game
[1:59:47] <suddenlyscorched> It if opens a watch and a door it's a clockpick
[1:59:47] <Mr_Strut> How the fuck does this dog pee so much?
[1:59:49] <StebTheVee> Are there any pro-war messages in media?
[1:59:50] <+ConLin_Arts_> psaDogchamp psaDogchamp
[1:59:50] <%BoxNavy> ‚úã
[1:59:50] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> He will use his hand to clean it
[1:59:51] <%narusao> bad baby
[1:59:52] <boomstickery> she needs your hand
[1:59:53] <bigshedman> Push the pee back with your hands
[1:59:57] <boomstickery> eww
[2:00:02] <%Wallabri> baby, how could you
[2:00:02] <derekwst3> !uptime
[2:00:03] <artoflec> dog stares at pee
[2:00:03] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 12s.
[2:00:04] <%mike2hands> psaDogchamp tobiasPOOP
[2:00:06] <+dmtjinni> 1 sec
[2:00:07] <OldManDeckardCain> if only there weren't like 3 types of side missions repeated a million times
[2:00:07] <%ha2ken> Dad life
[2:00:09] <artoflec> shit i mean pat stares at dog pee
[2:00:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @Mr_Strut it's to make up for his name not starting with P
[2:00:11] <+NoirePanzer> Is this the End of ZoE
[2:00:12] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> MGS5 had great gameplay but the fact all the dialogue was in the tapes is actually terrible and just put me off finishing it.
[2:00:13] <%QuesoFM> MGSV stream confirmed boys, we did it!
[2:00:14] <rytisone> Pat needs to listen about Millers Burgers
[2:00:17] <%mike2hands> psaHoldon
[2:00:18] <%BoxNavy> i hope their floor isnt carpeted
[2:00:24] <%GarbageNirvana> anyone looking for a good let's play in the meantime I highly recommend Chip Cheezum's
[2:00:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Pat Stares At Boofer
[2:00:28] <+Kairi__> ignore the story stuff and Phantom Pain is awesome
[2:00:31] <%a_goth_pancake> full dog stream when?
[2:00:39] <artoflec> I think i liked the codecs being replaced by tapes because you could keep playing while listening, but there is stuff in there i REALLY wish were cutscenes.
[2:00:40] <%a_goth_pancake> no games, just dog.

[2:03:46] <R_ketekt> Play them all
[2:03:46] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt I'd rather see how you react to Metal Gear Survive
[2:03:46] <%barrakuta371> Yes, but I'd rather you the Ace Combat DLC. Much shorter
[2:03:47] <+Manjove> dont really care honestly
[2:03:48] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Might as well do it until Cyberpunk
[2:03:49] <%coreyyotto> If there's nothing else exciting to play, sure
[2:03:49] <shoutofthehobo> I'd watch a stream of two
[2:03:51] <+Regigangster> Are you kidding? Who ELSE do I want to watch play it?
[2:03:51] <%P3_FeMC_best_girl> the intro in that game is fucking lit

[2:03:56] <%Quigsies> All of them plz
[2:03:56] <%QuesoFM> we like you, we like metal gear, seems like a win win
[2:03:56] <%ClutchRoadagain> An MGS marathon after this RE one would be epic
[2:03:58] <%a_goth_pancake> ORRR... play death stranding again
[2:04:00] <ECRead> chat you know what's bullshit? I got pulled over yesterday for my car tint being 2% darker than it's supposed to. 2%
[2:04:05] <+Regigangster> Pat please yes god yes I want to see you play MGSV
[2:04:07] <%CzeekyPlays> Do the whole MGS series, why not @PatStaresAt
[2:04:09] <%coreyyotto> Metal Gear Survive would be decent. Liam's playthrough was actually pretty interesting
[2:04:11] <%Tman451> Has Elmo seen Gief yet?
[2:04:14] <%OutofPots> not really
[2:04:18] <+JordantheKitty> @ECRead you met a bored cop, sorry pal
[2:04:18] <punishedVagabond> Play mgs3 first
[2:04:19] <%a_goth_pancake> üí© psaDogchamp
[2:04:20] <@SoFarFetched> Elmo has seen zangief many times
[2:04:21] <cureneckbeard> Pat just go MGS 1-2-3-PW-4-5-V. skip portops
[2:04:23] <danpc5> do metal gear month?
[2:04:28] <%GarbageNirvana> @ecread Who's out there being racist against cars
[2:04:41] <TheEvilOmega> just grind off screen in mgs5.
[2:04:41] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> @ECRead just ignore the sunlight 4Head
[2:04:41] <%SharkMissile> Skip 4 too
[2:04:45] <bigshedman> When's Metal Gear Poops?!
[2:04:47] <%patriotrenegade> Groob acquired
[2:04:55] <cureneckbeard> But 4 is the best MGS movie
[2:04:59] <%BoxNavy> do they not emulate well?
[2:04:59] <%LegendGHT> emulator
[2:05:00] <%Tman451> 2 and 3 HD still exists
[2:05:00] <%XeroSigmaPrime> 4 now has AMAZING emulation on PC
[2:05:04] <%LtSurge> 2, 3 and 4 are on PS Now
[2:05:05] <%patriotrenegade> Is PS3 not modern anymore
[2:05:08] <%Dementedpenguin> To this day I've NEVER played MGS4. I never owned a PS3.
[2:05:09] <aeonicvector> i mean 2 and 3 you COULD, but 4s def the roughest one
[2:05:09] <%BinaryFireball> you can play them on ps4 no? if you get the ps plus thing?
[2:05:15] <%camsool> they have two and three digitally. on Xbox and PlayStation.
[2:05:16] <RootVeggie> @PatStaresAt To be honest even if the ending of MGSV doesn't live up to the hype, the gameplay is the best in the series and the story has so many good moments and scenes.
[2:05:19] <cureneckbeard> PS3 outputs HDMI tho?
[2:05:23] <%Quigsies> Just get a ps3
[2:05:24] <%GarbageNirvana> You get rid of your PS3 or something?
[2:05:26] <%Dementedpenguin> LUL
[2:05:27] <%BoxNavy> he has canada internet he cant do ps now
[2:05:28] <%RueOrin> My PS3 just bricked :(
[2:05:29] <%ClutchRoadagain> @XeroSigmaPrime Oh, for real?
[2:05:30] <Timurine> mgs2 emu is awful for me
[2:05:33] <%RyTYoung> PS Now isn't bad when you can download the games
[2:05:36] <%a_goth_pancake> get mg collection on piss three
[2:05:37] <+Pyroclase> I've never played the metal gears due to not owning the consoles, and I maybe never will
[2:05:38] <%MassConnect> or you could just fugKonami
[2:05:38] <ahmz1404> I've never seen you play Demon's Souls
[2:05:40] <%BinaryFireball> you can play MGS1 on pc someone made a really good port
[2:05:42] <ECRead> it was very silly
[2:05:43] <bigshedman> that's dumb
[2:05:45] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Just in the past couple months, 4's emulation went from impossible to nearly perfect
[2:05:47] <%BinaryFireball> you just run the exe
[2:05:49] <%NovaKnightmare> Twin Snakes emulates exceptionally on Dolphin @PatStaresAt
[2:05:52] <clockworknait1> nobody should pay for psnow lol
[2:05:56] <%GarbageNirvana> That's what capture cards are for????
[2:05:57] <bleugh> there's an ancient PC version of 2
[2:06:02] <%BoxNavy> WHOA
[2:06:02] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ClutchRoadagain Yup, 4 emulates very well now
[2:06:05] <rytisone> nice
[2:06:08] <%SharkMissile> Physics
[2:06:08] <%coreyyotto> he fly
[2:06:09] <%suikudo> i played all of lost planet 2 on ps now
[2:06:10] <%GarbageNirvana> Or is the PS3 just that much of a pain in the ass
[2:06:10] <%Loinclothiclese> PogChamp
[2:06:13] <+linSP> I played all of persona 5 on my computer through streaming
[2:06:26] <StaticSunrise> just emulate it
[2:06:28] <%Arazien> Play the MSX versions of Metal Gear 1 & 2
[2:06:33] <%afronooch> Hot Take: Survive wasn't that bad. It wasn't great, but it didn't deserve the hate it got
[2:06:39] <cureneckbeard> I wouldn't wish MSX games on Pat
[2:06:46] <Onamar> Not enough that it matters
[2:06:47] <Cosairen> hahaha no
[2:06:49] <%Loinclothiclese> works fine for me
[2:06:51] <%Jekado> PS2 is fine
[2:06:52] <%coreyyotto> PS2 is fairly robust
[2:06:52] <%BinaryFireball> ps2 not really
[2:06:54] <%patriotrenegade> Max could do it.
[2:06:55] <%Dementedpenguin> MSX Contra Kappa
[2:06:55] <%Jekado> PS3 is a mess
[2:06:57] <%LegendGHT> ps2 is easy enough
[2:06:57] <%ClutchRoadagain> @XeroSigmaPrime I was thinking of doing it, but I didn't know what "playable" meant on their website.
[2:06:58] <Mr_Strut> PS3 yes, 2 is workable.
[2:06:59] <%NovaKnightmare> its iffy
[2:07:00] <CookieCutter007> pcsx2 is fine
[2:07:01] <%GarbageNirvana> I've seen it done well
[2:07:04] <danpc5> ps3 is prob better than 2 by now
[2:07:04] <Cosairen> im literally playing dq8 right now while watching
[2:07:05] <ahmz1404> DeS in 60fps is awesome tho
[2:07:06] <%mike2hands> Zngief is a weapon that surpass metal gear, because he's STWONG
[2:07:07] <%Quigsies> Not really?
[2:07:07] <%Jekado> PS5 emulation will come out before PS3
[2:07:08] <StaticSunrise> no, pscx2 is dead easy
[2:07:12] <SulfurousAcid> only a real man can beat msx contra
[2:07:12] <OldManDeckardCain> stream 2 and 3 from the ps vita Kappa
[2:07:15] <%ClutchRoadagain> PS2 is very fine.
[2:07:19] <%YakumoYomi> Nah, PS2 emulation is fine but PS3 is still rough
[2:07:20] <+linSP> I still got hiccups playing nocturne
[2:07:21] <+Bail_seven> i use ps2 and works fine
[2:07:22] <djblue_shift> it is if they have pressure sensitive controls
[2:07:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Legit wished blupoint developed a port of the Collection for PC
[2:07:26] <%barrakuta371> @GarbageNirvana PS3 has weird HDCP that prevents you from capturing the footage unless you have some weird workaround, I think.
[2:07:26] <%Quigsies> PS2 is way easier than PS3 at this point
[2:07:30] <DraxTD> PAWNCH
[2:07:36] <rytisone> yes
[2:07:41] <OzzySnek> I have an adapter that plays my PS2 on my HD tv. It ain't always pretty, but at least it works, lol.
[2:07:42] <%ClutchRoadagain> I was playing the old yakuza game on there the other day, and it ran just fine.
[2:07:54] <+fattmike> is there a piece of hardware that we could all donate towards to make this easier?
[2:07:56] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[2:08:04] <%reonome> F
[2:08:07] <%LegendGHT> just play 3 and 5
[2:08:09] <+pectusumbra> What are the chances of Konami automated fuckery from doing something like that?
[2:08:10] <+trekkie11041> breaks box dosent pick up item
[2:08:12] <%Dementedpenguin> Can't wait for MG Peace Walker Kappa
[2:08:14] <%Wallabri> Metal Gearathon
[2:08:16] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ClutchRoadagain 4 works perfectly, 60 fps at 4k... aslong as you have a powerful PC
[2:08:18] <%LegendGHT> Play the big boss games
[2:08:19] <%BoxNavy> and they never will :)
[2:08:19] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> xbox 360?
[2:08:20] <%BinaryFireball> MGS1 did
[2:08:21] <@commanderclaw> If Joe defeated Eveline would that make him a Ghost Puncher?
[2:08:22] <penitentpentwitch> Start with MGS5 and see how numbers go
[2:08:26] <+bugz_munny> ZOEH
[2:08:30] <%a_goth_pancake> Resident Evil 7 is a survival horror game
[2:08:31] <+dmtjinni> MGS news! Im so excited !!!
[2:08:32] <chambatron> Can a hacked wii u run ps2 and ps3?
[2:08:34] <+Bail_seven> play pichinco version
[2:08:34] <+bugz_munny> gawd damn 5g monstahs
[2:08:35] <%patriotrenegade> Both Hitler and Stalin were actually Albanian. This is why some historians refer to WWII as the ‚Äú13th Albanian Civil War‚Äù
[2:08:37] <%kindashagg> konami basement
[2:08:39] <indig0bird> MGS3 on PC would make so much fucking money
[2:08:41] <%suikudo> just do 1 2 and 5
[2:08:42] <cureneckbeard> There's some footage on YouTube that suggests PS3 emulation on the Metal Gear game runs really well on a high-end PC upscaled to 4K with minor graphical glitches
[2:08:46] <%ClutchRoadagain> I'm sure if we make a big enough fuss a PC port of the MGS games is possible.
[2:08:47] <MAGNUMB> 1 and 2 have PC ports
[2:08:54] <%MelBrooksKA> @PatStaresAt You could ask TFS guys how they did it, I remember they did a MGS marathon a year ago or so
[2:08:58] <Futurecity10> Isn‚Äôt the metal gear saga on 360?
[2:08:58] <ahmz1404> croc death sounds kinda sound like ds1 crows
[2:09:04] <%coyotesenpai> @PatStaresAt You figured out Vampire dude you can do this!
[2:09:04] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the 360 got the hd collection as well
[2:09:07] <+evbites> god damn it konami make ports
[2:09:12] <%Deekman> i say play through Gears of War
[2:09:13] <mesamus> the MGS HD collection is cross-generation with xbox one
[2:09:17] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Yup 4's emulation is sexy AF provided you have a modern pc
[2:09:19] <%OutofPots> Dark soul mods until yakuza comes out
[2:09:21] <mesamus> oh
[2:09:25] <%BoxNavy> you could emulate 2 and 3 on your own time and see how they run
[2:09:35] <clockworknait1> 1million excuses
[2:09:37] <%TheDullaMAN> Could you not just get a modded PS2?
[2:09:54] <%Dementedpenguin> Konami is too busy using the Fox Engine on soccer games Kappa
[2:10:03] <+ConLin_Arts_> I have a pretty good PC but even Scott Pilgrim on the PS3 emulator made it just shut off due to overwork
[2:10:16] <Futurecity10> Don‚Äôt you own an Xbox one
[2:10:18] <+Kairi__> line em up!
[2:10:20] <%Deekman> why not just buy a PS2 hdmi adapter. they're like $5 on amazon canada
[2:10:26] <MrPedrovsky> @thedullaman i wish i could so i would get a chance to play MGS. Not in Russia though LUL
[2:10:27] <%barrakuta371> I don't see why Konami won't sell the licenses to Metal Gear, Castle Vania, and SIlent Hill if they aren't doing anything with them.
[2:10:33] <%suikudo> xbox LUL
[2:10:34] <%NovaKnightmare> @PatStaresAt just stream the cutscene comps and pretend you're playing Kappa
[2:10:35] <%Agami23> yeah you can just get a ps2 HDMI
[2:10:37] <%Dementedpenguin> Like for real. There's more soccer games that use the Fox Engine than metal gear games
[2:10:40] <Stofil42> I hope this murderhobo returns in 8
[2:10:40] <%OfficioPrefectusCorgi> its on game pass i think
[2:10:42] <cephas97> YAKUZA MARATHON
[2:10:42] <%nothollowyet> so that's why you won't play Silent Hill 4 psaSmug
[2:10:43] <VanLynx> Vita TV?
[2:10:45] <+geistuser> no sense of owning an xbox if you have a pc
[2:10:51] <cherrycottontail> @barrakuta371 because they are doing something with them, PACHINKO
[2:10:54] <@commanderclaw> Don't you want a Sexbox?
[2:10:55] <%Loinclothiclese> @barrakuta371 cause fuck anyone that could do better thats why lol
[2:10:57] <HighxVoltage> the HD collection is also on ps3 so that is always an option.
[2:10:58] <%afronooch> they gotta have the license for pachinko
[2:10:59] <+captain_elsewhere> oh god i forgot this guy eats bugs to regen health elaD
[2:11:05] <%coreyyotto> LUL Yakuza marathon
[2:11:05] <%TheDullaMAN> You could always just play the 3DS version of MGS3 lol
[2:11:06] <%ClutchRoadagain> Damn, those boxing DOLLS are making a real difference now.
[2:11:17] <%a_goth_pancake> I like the way you die, bwoi
[2:11:17] <%barrakuta371> @barrakuta371 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[2:11:18] <%NovaKnightmare> How come Konami hates money and doesnt port their old games to PC
[2:11:21] <doctor_deadbeat> big power
[2:11:24] <%Dustwalker44> Rotate them saves!
[2:11:29] <%Loinclothiclese> @captain_elsewhere not if you mix them with chemicals you dont then it just turns into herb juice
[2:11:34] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt You see that Outbreak: The New Nightmare thing that comes out on PS4 tomorrow?
[2:12:03] <+Pyroclase> only cool things happen at church
[2:12:04] <%barrakuta371> @NovaKnightmare On the contrary, they do love money, that's why they're doing Pachinko machines
[2:12:05] <doctor_deadbeat> morir es vivir
[2:12:06] <@commanderclaw> If Joe collected all the effigies in all of Louisiana he could finally punch god like the SMT character he was always meant to be
[2:12:18] <ivanmistwalker> Mortis
[2:12:20] <+Skaphel> paige can still pick up Pat however
[2:12:23] <rytisone> now fight the fat vomit evil

[2:12:54] <krabthecrab> It's Gief
[2:12:56] <%LegendGHT> gooey mummy
[2:13:02] <Dragovus> @PatStaresAt Outbreak is described as a 90's survival horror with fixed camera
[2:13:07] <Ell1ot> Hi, Pat and Paige! I got McDoodoo's for the stream
[2:13:07] <doctor_deadbeat> oh dear

[2:13:21] <+dmtjinni> Pat are you still interested in Overwatch?
[2:13:24] <%GarbageNirvana> Apropos of nothing but I recently learned that the writer of the Witcher books was inspired to write the story while he was watching episodes of Seinfeld. Just thought y'all would enjoy that
[2:13:30] <%NopeBadguy> you gotta play street fighter in this fight, man, watch your spacing
[2:13:35] <%DappercatEsquire> what about a Soulslike month
[2:13:47] <@commanderclaw> Hey Pat, Left for Dead 2 is getting an update that finishes the story
[2:13:47] <%LegendGHT> I wish they rereleased Resident Evil Outbreak
[2:13:53] <+Bail_seven> isnt the mold the opposite of skelton
[2:13:58] <%Meekest> Paige to Zangief: Out of the way, you fat fuck
[2:14:25] <%Loinclothiclese> i wish joe was the protag instead of ethans lame ass
[2:14:29] <benjiFG> not the titty
[2:14:43] <%mike2hands> right in the titty
[2:14:52] <%barrakuta371> Oh wow. Was looking into the Konami stuff, and apparently they just launched a PC gaming brand called Arespear. They're all overpriced for the hardware.
[2:14:53] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Rotfiends be like
[2:14:54] <Ell1ot> Punch that orb!
[2:15:09] <doctor_deadbeat> give em the old one-two kid
[2:15:21] <%BoxNavy> great
[2:15:35] <%Taisuru> Jab, hook, uppercut
[2:15:44] <%suikudo> just do 5 then
[2:15:44] <gade177> Is Konami viewed any better in Japan? They seem to have horrible PR everywhere.
[2:15:44] <SomeOtherNeb> MGS marathon would take years
[2:15:47] <%afronooch> just do 5
[2:15:49] <%LegendGHT> just play 5 then
[2:15:52] <%BoxNavy> so you cant stream it on the ps3? dang
[2:15:52] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt how about 1-4 and ignore 5?
[2:15:53] <%Jekado> isn't MGS4 like 1000 hours long?
[2:15:55] <+NoirePanzer> ZoE there you are!
[2:15:57] <%mike2hands> just 5 then
[2:15:57] <+MugenSandan> okay but do it though - that one guy
[2:15:58] <chambatron> A lot of time as well, like 1 month

[2:17:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fact that he's doing this incredibly elaborate attempt at killing Joe instead of just ripping his head off while he was knocked out is baffling and hilarious. Unless he knew Joe would survive that which is even crazier.
[2:17:34] <rytisone> Who fished him outta swamp?

[2:18:23] <%NopeBadguy> @commandersqueaks I feel like there are constantly parts of jack in there fighting back against the mold, which probably stopped him from the direct approach

[2:19:03] <%KaseTriedAgain> KaseTriedAgain subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[2:19:06] <%CommanderSqueaks> @NopeBadguy Which means Jack knows Joe is an insane crazy badass who can literally survive being drowned with no issue.

[2:21:49] <%Meekest> AND ITS SUPER RAD
[2:21:49] <+OwlLightningMage> JOE BAKER IS THE TRUE HERO OF RE

[2:21:52] <krabthecrab> Well, he IS the best character
[2:21:56] <%toolofparanoia> Joe needs a sequel
[2:21:56] <%torusendor> I love that Joe's response to the power fist is exactly the same as the audience's
[2:21:59] <StebTheVee> Joe = Definitely a Hero
[2:22:01] <+nirvana227> that music lol

[2:22:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stomp his dick
[2:22:03] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> JOE IS THE HERO
[2:22:06] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Welcome to the family son *punches*
[2:22:10] <%BinaryFireball> I wonder who set up the shadow puzzles.....
[2:22:16] <$Dakuu75> Was Lucas always a shit?
[2:22:16] <+bugz_munny> JOE BAKEAH HERE TO PUNCH THE 5G MONSTAHS
[2:22:18] <%NopeBadguy> Family must defeat family. Oh God, is this Devil May Cry?
[2:22:20] <%Dementedpenguin> The hero RE doesn't deserve.
[2:22:28] <%Loinclothiclese> @Dakuu75 yes
[2:22:29] <%maenos2> i love the power fist, its so bad
[2:22:33] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also I feel like that if you weren't super insane strong like Joe the Powerfist would just dislocate your arm the moment you used it.
[2:22:46] <%AncelDeLambert> Joe seriously out here equipped with Mr Pushy
[2:22:47] <+NickHatesSnow> @BinaryFireball Most likely Lucas since he set up most of the puzzles
[2:22:48] <Zebroneath> This fucking epic music playing when a hillbilly finds a robo glove
[2:22:53] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Isaac Clarke's 20-ton boots
[2:22:55] <%SharkMissile> I wish like hell you could use this in the regular campaign
[2:22:59] <+bugz_munny> best new RE7 character is a joke character
[2:23:02] <huskarl_zap> ah yes the only good part of the game the ones that has no Canadian involvement whatsoever
[2:23:10] <%MassConnect> can you imagine if you were scared and just inching through the level to this soundtrack
[2:23:13] <+Kairi__> Combination complete
[2:23:13] <+ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:23:13] <%BoxNavy> there are probably weird stabilizer shits in the glove that stops it from destroying your hand
[2:23:13] <zeif00> I could only hope to be half as cool as Joe when I'm that old
[2:23:20] <chaumiester> Is this the Greatest or Dumbest point in RE History? Robot Punching Arm?
[2:23:22] <%cvp5127> the strongest fist
[2:23:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SharkMissile It'd probably dislocate Ethan's shoulder everytime he used it, which would actually be kind of awesome.
[2:23:24] <+Skaphel> put the God Hand theme on
[2:23:25] <%elicoy> That deep south strength
[2:23:26] <%AncelDeLambert> does the full combo charge the fist?
[2:23:30] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Dog Champion psaDogchamp
[2:23:35] <$Dakuu75> @chaumiester BOTH
[2:23:45] <rbakervv> @chaumiester both, both is good
[2:23:48] <+bugz_munny> that thing would rip the arm right off your body at sonic speed
[2:23:48] <%YakumoYomi> @chaumiester Yes

[2:24:03] <%stabbityrabbit> @chaumiester Dumbest if Chris never gets one, best if Joe is willing to share.

[2:24:07] <%Loinclothiclese> @DukeBlack_ i doubt it lol
[2:24:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is just Dante versus Urizen

[2:24:13] <ScreamLord> My Arm! My Arm! My Arm! My Arm!My Arm! My Arm!My Arm! My Arm!
[2:24:20] <+morphinepanda> Joe said bionic arm?
[2:24:26] <%Loinclothiclese> @DukeBlack_ i wish he was the main character entirely instead of ethan
[2:24:29] <%GarbageNirvana> The only thing that would make that glove better is if Joe shouted "LOUISIANA PUNCH"
[2:24:34] <@SoFarFetched> rip paige's butt
[2:24:36] <%BoxNavy> the slucture
[2:24:38] <@SoFarFetched> again

[2:25:00] <$Dakuu75> @DukeBlack_ if ethan is back, I'd be surprised if zoe and joe aren't. (zoe probably gonna hold a grudge about the cure)
[2:25:00] <%YakumoYomi> LOUISIANA...SMASH!
[2:25:10] <+bugz_munny> Lucas turned into a Tyrant
[2:25:12] <%GarbageNirvana> is a slucture a structure that puts out
[2:25:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Marg's transformation is actually the grossest.

[2:28:52] <%Loinclothiclese> Joe would have been a way better protagonist than ethan if the entire game were him putting his family out of their misery instead of ethans lame hunt for the wife that lied to him for years

[2:31:01] <+linSP> auuuughh
[2:31:02] <%Loinclothiclese> eat the bug do it
[2:31:06] <+evbites> bugs
[2:31:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Eat bug?
[2:31:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> I really like how in RE7 its like, "just because this is set in the deep south this family arent crazy hillbillies. they were perfectly normal mild-mannered people who only became crazy and evil after they got cursed by Umbrella goo" but then the DLC is like "Oh but their uncle? Yeah he's a crazy hillbilly who punches alligators in the face"
[2:31:13] <doctor_deadbeat> you'll get him this time champ
[2:31:13] <%Agami23> you had like 10 bugs
[2:31:16] <blue6sub6remnant6> Does Joe Baker is Eat Bugs for Health?
[2:31:17] <%Loinclothiclese> YEA OOPS
[2:31:20] <%thegreenbenis> You can eat bugs
[2:31:32] <SupaDanBot> BRING IT ON BOI
[2:31:38] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Loinclothiclese I disagree. Joe try to save his family and putting em down in a familar enivronment wouldnt really feel like "entering survival horror". And Ethan only hunts for his wife in the beginning and the end? He literally thinks he killed her then tries to escape
[2:31:42] <%Loinclothiclese> @blue6sub6remnant6 bugs and heal juice hes a growing boy
[2:31:47] <chambatron> We megalobox now

[2:32:54] <bigshedman> @linSP Speaking of centipedes, you remember that movie Zach? That's right, Human Centipede. That movie was ahead of its time.

[2:34:03] <+olwe123> This is both the coolest and the dumbest
[2:34:10] <%Loinclothiclese> @XeroSigmaPrime But your disregarding the fact that he had no idea any of that stuff happened him living away from the home so exploring a home nothing like what he remembers full of monsters and muck would be just the same no one says it has to be as anime but as a character i enjoy joe and his goal more than ethans bland ass
[2:34:12] <+dmtjinni> Nintendo! Hire this guy!!!
[2:34:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> @torusendor Hmmm. I mean, I think im blessed that my "conspiracy theorist uncle" is actually internally consistent in his beliefs. Like, he's not some Alex Jones type who believes elections are rigged until His Guy wins and then they're real. He never votes, and afaik might not even have a social security number
[2:34:21] <Blackscience91> He sounds like Birkin

[2:34:51] <%OperatorJo_> oh PatCam is back
[2:34:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Loinclothiclese Yea, and he still has no idea. But this DLC doesn't feel anything close to survival horror compared to base RE7

[2:42:45] <%barrakuta371> Gamescom, gonna lean towards no
[2:42:46] <xanerts> i was there last year it was terrible
[2:42:50] <blue6sub6remnant6> Video games are terrible, so no.

[2:43:21] <rytisone> ask konami for a re-release
[2:43:21] <bluefooddye1> Legacy collection on PS3
[2:43:22] <%Agami23> just get a ps2 HDMI adapter
[2:43:22] <SirKeigan> Are you gonna play the entire series or just MGS5?
[2:43:25] <%Lion_kun> Is Pat done with RE7?
[2:43:32] <%Deekman> PS# is the easiest as long as you have an HDCP stripper
[2:43:36] <%Deekman> PS3*
[2:43:36] <%coreyyotto> Would you be able to borrow an old elgato from Woolie?

[2:44:08] <SirKeigan> Your hand is too blurry
[2:44:13] <cureneckbeard> Easiest way to play metal gear is MGS1 on literally whatever platform, 2-3-PW on the PS3 bundle, 4 on PS3 only, and MGSV on PC
[2:44:14] <SirKeigan> When you do that fast your hand is blurry and scary
[2:44:14] <%D00msDayDan> i can't watch twitch above like 480p anyway most of the time
[2:44:15] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> 720 is as high as mgs3 goes
[2:44:15] <Profmcstevie> They aren't SUPER precise games but.....
[2:44:17] <%crimsonharvest> oh its gonna be ugly as shit for re-streaming if you have to reencode their stream right?

[2:49:01] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Follow up to the question about wanting your time back from League, what games do you genuinely regret spending time on?
[2:49:04] <boomstickery> my dog bit my aunties septum when she was a puppy
[2:49:06] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> Ps2 hdmi cable works
[2:49:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is never gonna play the New Vegas DLC LUL

[2:49:30] <%coreyyotto> Like a component to hdmi converter or something
[2:49:31] <%M4T1A5> you can get them easy
[2:49:37] <SirKeigan> Adapt or die
[2:49:38] <%crimsong0ddess> hdmi converter?
[2:49:42] <%mike2hands> you can get an adaptor
[2:49:43] <$Wurmspawn> I literally have one hocked up to my ps2 right now @PatStaresAt
[2:49:44] <+NickHatesSnow> is there something wrong with the ps3 hd collection?
[2:49:44] <%BinaryFireball> Pat if your TV has component then that's all you need as it most likely has an HDMI out
[2:49:45] <+rXpCH> Why nont use the PS3 version ?
[2:49:45] <Jetsfantasy> Yes there are
[2:49:48] <%Aeoneth> I will continue to shill Freedom Fighters

[2:50:00] <%M4T1A5> yeah the adapters are component to HDMI converters basically
[2:50:01] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> Welcome out of the Family, son
[2:50:01] <antshadow14> Hyperkin ps2
[2:50:02] <cureneckbeard> You don't want to play 2/3/PW on PS2 anyway, because there are HD remakes for PS3/360 which are superior
[2:50:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> FAREWELL TO THE FAMILY, BRO

[2:50:08] <%SirGO0SE> also emulation for those games are pretty solid
[2:50:10] <+echobee_tv> ZOEH
[2:50:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> its like the opposite of welcome to the family son
[2:50:12] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> "Welcome to the family"...now "Farewell from the family."
[2:50:14] <ScreamLord> Get outta the family son
[2:50:25] <bigshedman> Joe sounds weirdly accepting of the fact that his brother turned into a monster and has to be put down VERY violently.
[2:50:28] <rytisone> bugsnax
[2:50:29] <%ha2ken> Punch your family to save your family
[2:50:29] <%DappercatEsquire> "Jack, remember that time I punched the top half of your body off?"
[2:50:29] <cureneckbeard> Pat, you could start with MGS1 (PSX emulator or whatever), and by the time you're done maybe you'll have discovered a better way to play PS2 onward
[2:50:31] <%M3djedx> nyannPOG

[3:01:50] <Aydarkzero> lmao
[3:01:52] <StebTheVee> it was the dentist fault I didn't care
[3:01:52] <%Starotter70> Yeah
[3:01:52] <%KoiRedd> If the dentist has to straddle you to perform the necessary procedure, it's game over, man... Game over.
[3:01:55] <%HDmexiqtioner> I was punching my chin cause I couldn't feel it.
[3:01:57] <xxmagonx> LUL

[3:02:46] <+dmtjinni> The LUL gas
[3:02:48] <SirKeigan> Laughing Gas is so much better. You feel it so fast. I thought they were taking the teeth out when I felt something and they said they already did

[3:03:03] <%BoxNavy> gimme that shit
[3:03:04] <$Dakuu75> that's the best kind of shit to give
[3:03:04] <rytisone> it turned into a scene from Lethal Weapon 4
[3:03:06] <%HDmexiqtioner> Can you buy laughing gas recreationally?
[3:03:12] <SirKeigan> I listened to the music and zoned out like I was at a concert
[3:03:17] <$Tuskor13> I want to get high on the gas

[3:03:32] <+scrumbotime> "Hey can I get Extra Drugs" is something they sadly don't do often
[3:03:32] <+Dunder_Mifflinz> Methane
[3:03:33] <Darkfire346> I had the gas and when they stuck a needle into my gums they hit a nerve and the right side of my face felt like it was on fire
[3:03:37] <%HDmexiqtioner> Go to your local Gas Dealer
[3:03:38] <SirKeigan> Two Os and an N
