[0:57:40] <+mechslayer71> WHY WOULD YOU NOT

[0:57:48] <alcors_wisdom> if pete wasnt spiderman he could have prevent doc from turning
[0:57:48] <gyrogogozeppeli> THEN YOU DONT GET THEM
[0:57:48] <bearwagon> the crime bonuses overlap
[0:57:49] <LokimenD> Like punching somebody in the dark
[0:57:50] <prettypatties97> Then you don't get those tokens
[0:57:50] <%Kage_96> Then you get only 1 crime token
[0:57:51] <%rdark_ksu> then you get the minimum
[0:57:52] <%umbypokochan> but this way the game is Spiderman Space Jam
[0:57:52] <LiquidMathew> Crimes give you 1 plus 2 extras

[0:58:48] <%deviljhojho94> hmmm
[0:58:48] <%Cynful_Pleasures> There are more than enough street crimes in the game to make everything even if you don't do the bonus objective

[0:58:53] <+TsunamiPoro> it is pat
[0:58:54] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> In a sense
[0:58:54] <Mr_Strut> NO
[0:58:55] <tacostarvedbeast> spiderman is KING CRIMSON?????!!!!
[0:58:55] <%BioApple> if you commit half a crime and then stop, you stopped a crime and are a hero
[0:58:55] <thelonechris> It's a reflex
[0:58:55] <IminyourBase> paige is actually right
[0:58:56] <laguerrilha> Spider sense makes no logical reason
[0:58:58] <%Remery_> super reflexes
[0:58:58] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Kind of?
[0:58:59] <cherubsanonymous> It's the SHARINGAN
[0:58:59] <Sochin_Iitsu> It's not precognition
[0:59:00] <+SuichiTanaka> It's weak pre-cognition
[0:59:01] <BooitsDock> no
[0:59:01] <blakyoshi> he's a Newtype
[0:59:01] <pulppedro> IT‚ÄôS KING CRIMSSON
[0:59:01] <%deviljhojho94> wtf
[0:59:01] <baronvonkame> isnt spidey sense based of insectile lens eyes and how much better they are at seeing movement?
[0:59:02] <+oOZtkOo> its not precognition
[0:59:02] <SubliminaIMessages> Spidey Sense is like "Oh shit shit it about to pop off"
[0:59:02] <Mondeiya> spiderman is just thinking really fast
[0:59:03] <Recthel> it's like a general sense of danger
[0:59:03] <Hawkbone_> Its totally precognition
[0:59:04] <%Cynful_Pleasures> It's fuzzy
[0:59:06] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Aw shit I just realized I did a pun. Fuck.
[0:59:07] <+FierceDeityGabriel> It is canonically magic
[0:59:07] <%ToxInjection> that's really vague future telling
[0:59:08] <AlasterAngelo> I DONT KNOW HOW KING CRIMSON WORKS
[0:59:11] <IminyourBase> it's almost precognition
[0:59:12] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> don't you tell me Spidey is "pulling punches" when throwing a 50 pound MANHOLE COVER at people.
[0:59:12] <pectusumbra> it's just sensing killing intent
[0:59:13] <+ryujinran> paige isn't wrong
[0:59:14] <tacostarvedbeast> it just WORKS paige
[0:59:15] <%heyitsbrian> Spidey is a short-term Precog
[0:59:16] <+FierceDeityGabriel> Spider totem
[0:59:17] <%MagickBurritoh> it's not
[0:59:18] <+Nomicro4u> Wouldn't it be better to have fly sense?
[0:59:18] <IminyourBase> it's borderline precognition
[0:59:19] <%bloodypurpledog> He senses danger he doesn't sense the future
[0:59:19] <alwayspronking> The danger was already happening at him
[0:59:20] <+edited156> pre cignition?
[0:59:20] <LiquidMathew> its a psychological awareness of the environment
[0:59:21] <%Cynful_Pleasures> It is not precog
[0:59:21] <element_of_loyalty> PRE COG NITION?
[0:59:21] <fruit_pie_the_magician> canonically it is precognition
[0:59:22] <gyrogogozeppeli> PAT ITS EASY
[0:59:22] <ATentacleMonster> How would he see it behind him if it wasn't
[0:59:22] <+Grayhammatter> how does king crimson work pat?
[0:59:22] <Mr_Strut> It BORDERS on precog
[0:59:23] <%ToxInjection> you just know A dangerous thing is gonna happen
[0:59:23] <ThatGuyThere03> IT'S SIMPLE
[0:59:24] <vivecdidnothingwrong> It's really vague and mostly not
[0:59:24] <Meta_Four> Spider-Man is really just teleporting.
[0:59:24] <%NovaKnightmare> it just works
[0:59:25] <%MagickBurritoh> it's almost
[0:59:25] <dadeaner> perCOGnition
[0:59:25] <%Agami23> does anyone?
[0:59:27] <element_of_loyalty> 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
[0:59:27] <prettypatties97> No one does Pat
[0:59:27] <+Nomicro4u> Like have you ever tried to hit a fly with your hands?
[0:59:27] <%commanderclaw> IT JUST WORKS
[0:59:27] <+FadingEmber> Can you redo challenges once you do the Task Master mission?
[0:59:28] <cherubsanonymous> It just works
[0:59:28] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> It's a deus ex machina.
[0:59:30] <Archmortal> Precognition is correct. Premonition is not.
[0:59:30] <EMP_Ike_Turner> that's why his mask eyes narrow its sensory oveload
[0:59:30] <alcors_wisdom> is spider sense [king krimson]
[0:59:30] <HazeNyne> it just works
[0:59:31] <hellothisisxig> i've gotta head to bed. it was fun getting to join a stream for a change!!!!!
[0:59:33] <Monsterstalker74> TELEPORTATION
[0:59:33] <+SuichiTanaka> His Spider-sense goes off even when he ISN'T aware of a danger
[0:59:34] <ThatGuyThere03> KING CRIMSON IS THE SIMPLEST SHIT
[0:59:34] <+eldritchbee> That's epitath not King Crimson
[0:59:34] <masterfire23> how does king crimson work NotLikeThis
[0:59:35] <gustavozxd> what about when spiderman predicted thanos in the infinity war comics
[0:59:35] <%rdark_ksu> its an alarm that says anywhere from 5-30 seconds shits gonna get bad. Idk where from or how bad but have fun
[0:59:36] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> My spider sense is-aw fuck
[0:59:36] <$ImasukyLomae> no it's sensing the movment in the air
[0:59:36] <SecretAgentPickles> Spider-Man just teleports like Wesker Kappa
[0:59:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> BOOOO
[0:59:36] <%Ninestempest> It's JUST ABOUT precog, but not actually.
[0:59:37] <%Cynful_Pleasures> It's nearly procog, but not quite
[0:59:37] <xddddsorandom> THIS IS HOW KING CRIMSON WORKS... AND THAT'S HOW IT WORKS
[0:59:37] <element_of_loyalty> cause cause
[0:59:38] <%SuperCasualBoom> Spider Sense is the equal to a tingle sensation in your dick
[0:59:40] <calder87> part of it is seeing the very near future, the other part is like The Hand but for time
[0:59:40] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> BOOOOO
[0:59:41] <hyphenated_q> I think that whether it precog or enhanced senses depends on the writer
[0:59:41] <Your_Lost_Eraser> JUST WAIT TILL CRAZY TALK APPEARS
[0:59:42] <mr_slaide> But how does it works?
[0:59:42] <$SirTerribleh> Supermans super power is photosynthesis
[0:59:43] <%ToxInjection> YANK apatDab
[0:59:44] <pulppedro> One week till Part 5 PogChamp
[0:59:44] <cherubsanonymous> "Imagine you ate an apple, but you didn't eat the apple"
[0:59:45] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> Pat's weird looking, too.
[0:59:46] <devanmuse> it's instinct. It's like when you realize someone is about to swing a bat upside your head, just... ampolified exponentially
[0:59:46] <gyrogogozeppeli> Like Pat
[0:59:47] <RetributionP> booo
[0:59:47] <ape_hawk> so are you
[0:59:48] <alcors_wisdom> part 5 soon
[0:59:50] <$GohanEgret> hot
[0:59:50] <tacostarvedbeast> HAWT AF
[0:59:51] <%NuclearLawlocausto> THAT'S ANOTHER STAND
[0:59:52] <+bigfado287> king crimson looks rad
[0:59:52] <ATentacleMonster> ewww
[0:59:53] <crimsonharvest> King Crimson is a foundation of prog rock and all its subgenres
[0:59:54] <bearwagon> King Crimson makes sense if you count epitaph as part of the process
[0:59:55] <NopeBadguy> I would liken Spider-Sense more to like an instinct
[0:59:56] <element_of_loyalty> PAT HAS A BEAUTY MARK
[0:59:58] <%NovaKnightmare> King Crimson: Angry, doesnt make sense, loves crime, and is red
[0:59:58] <madpuppy2424> King crimson is an amazing band
[0:59:59] <+Nomicro4u> you might want to get that checked
[1:00:00] <Your_Lost_Eraser> BatChest
[1:00:01] <prettypatties97> ... Moley?
[1:00:01] <iwa5h4ck3d> Its like when ur bones hurt when its about to rain
[1:00:01] <Demon_chann> spiderman did lose his spider sense once right?
[1:00:02] <pulppedro> King Crimson best stand Kappa
[1:00:04] <+walternatorz> moley moley mole
[1:00:04] <thelonechris> A mole in the system
[1:00:07] <AncelDeLambert> haha, Pat's in love, NEEEEERD
[1:00:09] <DantesAnimus> MOley! <3
[1:00:09] <ATentacleMonster> It's not that complicated, Pat
[1:00:10] <NopeBadguy> IT JUST WORKS
[1:00:11] <%bloodypurpledog> Holy Moley
[1:00:11] <gyrogogozeppeli> Read the manga
[1:00:12] <Elofhousewood> Spider sense is 360 degrees of awareness not vision. He knows something nearby is dangerous but not what or where.
[1:00:12] <cherubsanonymous> I HATE WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:00:13] <ATentacleMonster> That's just a meme
[1:00:13] <%ECRead> King Krimson can eat puss and ass at the same time
[1:00:14] <+eldritchbee> Pat it works like
[1:00:14] <+fFailureatlife> King Crimson is the coolest
[1:00:14] <+Bloodbourneidentity> that man is dead you knocked him off the roof PAT!!
[1:00:16] <AlasterAngelo> i dont like part 5 in general tbh
[1:00:16] <+capnbeeb> who let todd howard on stream
[1:00:16] <alwayspronking> oh boy yeah
[1:00:16] <+Grayhammatter> it just WORKS
[1:00:18] <%Agami23> hopfully the anime makes it make more sense
[1:00:18] <mr_slaide> Todd Coward: IT JUST WORKS!
[1:00:19] <laguerrilha> Agente Moley from the FBI
[1:00:19] <%SuperCasualBoom> Spider man should do a DDT
[1:00:21] <%Ninestempest> King Crimson in anime is probably gonna be a lot mor ereasonabl eto understand
[1:00:21] <element_of_loyalty> STAY STILLS
[1:00:21] <$portabledingus> WHAT THE FUCK IS KING CRIMSON GONNA DO TO THE OP
[1:00:21] <+eldritchbee> and it does that and thats how it works
[1:00:22] <circular7> moley's return!
[1:00:24] <%ECRead> I regret saying that
[1:00:24] <Sapphire_Breeze> Pat is too smart to read and understand the manga
[1:00:24] <+Grayhammatter> air yanks pat
[1:00:25] <pulppedro> I know how it works Kappa
[1:00:27] <gyrogogozeppeli> How about reading the manga then
[1:00:27] <+ArmoredDeath> atpButtHash evoGG mahHyper
[1:00:29] <+Bloodbourneidentity> super murder hero crimes
[1:00:29] <Parapattern> Isn't actual spider sense produced from the long hairs on a spider's body? They can feel changes and pressure and stuff around them?
[1:00:31] <grayjammer> It makes sense,it just hasn't been explained well by translations
[1:00:32] <+bigfado287> King Crimson is the shit
[1:00:32] <$portabledingus> WILL THEY JUST SKIP THE OP???
[1:00:33] <$GohanEgret> Translator's Note: It just works
[1:00:33] <tacostarvedbeast> doesnt gold experience requiem JUST WORK as well?
[1:00:34] <demongirl986> king crimson is kinda like, bad video editing but a stand
[1:00:34] <ATentacleMonster> They're gonna make it super simple in the anime
[1:00:35] <+TsunamiPoro> it makes more sense in the newer translations
[1:00:36] <%NuclearLawlocausto> @angriestpat King Crimson's other face is another stand
[1:00:36] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> Neck broken
[1:00:37] <%rdark_ksu> I've been reading through 5 for a few weeks. Fuck do I miss the 2
[1:00:37] <+oOZtkOo> @AngriestPat King Crimson is video editing software for reality
[1:00:38] <devanmuse> So for the final episode of Part 5, is the OP just going to repeat over and over again for 21 minutes?
[1:00:39] <%GarbageNirvana> I coulda swore I had a Todd Howard emote
[1:00:39] <pulppedro> Golden Wind anime gonna be so good
[1:00:40] <baronvonkame> why the actual fuck is King Crimson so unecessarilly convoluted tbh
[1:00:41] <%NovaKnightmare> Its also a reference to Todd coward
[1:00:42] <the_mental_punk> Isn't KC technically 2 stands?
[1:00:43] <StrawberryPantsu> @AngriestPat When is the return to FFXIV YOU COWARD?
[1:00:44] <halospaz117> Diavolo will be portrayed by Todd Howard
[1:00:44] <blackbaron98> death
[1:00:46] <element_of_loyalty> Stan Lee?
[1:00:49] <%Hispanacomida25> it's literally just a skip chapter button on a remote. that's what it is
[1:00:50] <+Grayhammatter> that's todd coward
[1:00:50] <AlasterAngelo> Regular Gold Experience just works too
[1:00:51] <+Bouerd> No that was Todd Howard
[1:00:52] <aiyobro> king crimson is a rock group lol
[1:00:52] <alcors_wisdom> also get ready for "i made it soft"
[1:00:53] <DXLelouch24> SPIDEYs spidersense is not magic IT warn him of threats ill fight you Paige
[1:00:55] <LiquidMathew> its a western thing because of the bad fan translation of 5
[1:00:59] <%BioApple> @Parapattern don't know but they can sense that kind of stuff through their webs if they're on them
[1:01:00] <%Cynful_Pleasures> It comes from weird translation scans
[1:01:03] <Your_Lost_Eraser> KING CRIMSON LOOKS INTO THE FUTRE AND JUST SPP
[1:01:06] <pulppedro> The band King Crimson acknowledged the meme
[1:01:09] <$Mendin> Beautiful Vienna
[1:01:09] <%tinyswampthing> king crimson is super easy to explain its just skipping time
[1:01:11] <aiyobro> king krimson?
[1:01:12] <Your_Lost_Eraser> SPEEDS THAT MOMENT PAST
[1:01:13] <+mobius_won> It‚Äôs like Durant
[1:01:13] <Them00n> @AngriestPat Watch the Futurama episode "Time keeps on slipping" to see how KC works.
[1:01:14] <%crot45> hey pat when i was 6 I used to hide some of my candy in my pockets and such then cry i didnt get as much as my older cousins on halloween. I didn't steal but i did trick and conive
[1:01:14] <gyrogogozeppeli> If you still dont understand KC then you just didnt read the manga
[1:01:16] <calder87> part of King Crimson is seeing the very near future, the other part is like The Hand but for time
[1:01:17] <%deviljhojho94> just take the hit
[1:01:22] <gyrogogozeppeli> He uses TWO STANDS
[1:01:23] <zamzoph> IT JUST WORKS
[1:01:24] <element_of_loyalty> GOOGLE IT PEACH
[1:01:25] <alwayspronking> yeah, it is
[1:01:26] <alcors_wisdom> the "it just works" thing was a mistranslated
[1:01:27] <+QuadraticGravity> King crimson is used super inconsistently too
[1:01:27] <SomersaultJustice> how does duwang work
[1:01:28] <SailingSaturn> No Spoilers cirBaka
[1:01:30] <ATentacleMonster> Everyone knew that cause of the meme though
[1:01:30] <gyrogogozeppeli> he looks at the future then he skips
[1:01:34] <KayThree> didn't araki confess that he forgot partway through vento aureo that HE forgot how king crimson worked?
[1:01:35] <%Hispanacomida25> @angriestpat It's the equivalent of a skip chapter button on a remote control
[1:01:38] <%NuclearLawlocausto> TWO STANDS
[1:01:40] <baronvonkame> @AngriestPat do you have a place to message you?
[1:01:43] <+eldritchbee> Araki Forgot
[1:01:44] <%NovaKnightmare> I found that King Crimson's power isnt a spoiler, but his user
[1:01:44] <Mr_Strut> The power is plot armor
[1:01:45] <+bigbradish> Who's stand is it?
[1:01:46] <alcors_wisdom> yeah its a super huge spoiler
[1:01:46] <$portabledingus> Even if paige googles it she wont get it
[1:01:46] <%Mev852_> Google it!
[1:01:47] <AlasterAngelo> DIO'S STAND CAN BREATH FIRE
[1:01:49] <element_of_loyalty> JOJOJOJOJO
[1:01:49] <%BioApple> HOW DO YOU SKIP TIME
[1:01:50] <tacostarvedbeast> does paige care about spoilers? oh wait chat nvm
[1:01:53] <cherubsanonymous> And then read it outloud
[1:01:54] <pulppedro> Google it no spoilers
[1:01:55] <KiraKamixephos> ZAAAAA WARUDO
[1:01:56] <demongirl986> gee *name redacted*, how come araki lets you have TWO stands?
[1:01:57] <BinaryShuffle> It Just Werks
[1:01:58] <alcors_wisdom> up to you
[1:01:58] <prettypatties97> Ah, I see Paige shares my super power of terrible memory
[1:01:59] <%umbypokochan> i wish i liked jojo .. :(
[1:01:59] <%boratebuffer> araki forgets how literally every stand works halfway through the series
[1:01:59] <Your_Lost_Eraser> KING CRIMSON SPEEDS MOMENTS PAST AFTER LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE
[1:02:00] <aiyobro> 21st century schizoid man
[1:02:02] <%deviljhojho94> hmmmm
[1:02:04] <bluehermitdog> So what's the lame dub name of King Crimson gonna be?
[1:02:06] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige doesn‚Äôt care about spoiled mustard
[1:02:06] <pulppedro> Has Paige read/watched any Jojo?
[1:02:10] <Huntercd> She like a gold fish
[1:02:10] <element_of_loyalty> Pat has to plan Paiges plan
[1:02:10] <amavii> it's not that complicated
[1:02:11] <Sapphire_Breeze> I UNDERSTAND IT
[1:02:11] <gyrogogozeppeli> Actual lies
[1:02:12] <ATentacleMonster> that's not true LUL
[1:02:14] <%deviljhojho94> lies
[1:02:14] <CanadianAdam> i want to see pat get it put in his butt against the sable base
[1:02:16] <bearwagon> King Crimson making sense unfortunately makes one consequence super convoluted in how it occured
[1:02:16] <ThatGuyThere03> Pat it's really simple
[1:02:17] <%deviljhojho94> no one gets it
[1:02:17] <+oOZtkOo> ITS NOT HARD
[1:02:17] <AlasterAngelo> look up filthy acts at a reasonable price
[1:02:17] <The_Sorrow_> I do :)
[1:02:17] <+CaptainJax> its just that futurama episode
[1:02:19] <Estuko> so we're going to ignore that unintentional dodge, okay
[1:02:21] <%rdark_ksu> its doctor who levels of Shut up it just does
[1:02:22] <Bloodworks12> I do
[1:02:22] <+BaronEgo> It's not hard to get
[1:02:23] <Them00n> PAT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN READ PART 5
[1:02:23] <gyrogogozeppeli> Only normal people understand it
[1:02:24] <devanmuse> you know that episode of Futurama where time randomly skips forward? It's a weaponized version of that.
[1:02:25] <CriticKitten> It's not even hard to understand
[1:02:25] <NopeBadguy> THOSE DUDES ARE DEAD
[1:02:25] <$magikestral> king crimson is not hard to understand, its just inconsistent
[1:02:26] <%deviljhojho94> DEAD
[1:02:26] <element_of_loyalty> DO NOT READS OUTS LOUDS
[1:02:26] <EMP_Ike_Turner> ded
[1:02:28] <%Ninestempest> IDK, I looked up every stand for part 4 and was totally baffled the entire anime run
[1:02:28] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> BIG DEAD
[1:02:29] <+QuadraticGravity> The fact that fucking everyone in chat is explaining it differently explains most of it.
[1:02:29] <Dio_TR> Only Joel from vinesauce
[1:02:29] <thelonechris> Kill all the convicts
[1:02:31] <+Bloodbourneidentity> murder constant murder
[1:02:32] <tacostarvedbeast> @AngriestPat you should pause to see the moment paige goes cross eyed from confusion?
[1:02:32] <BigNerdSam> I understand it!
[1:02:32] <grayjammer> It's one of those things you can feel that you can understand, but not explain
[1:02:34] <baronvonkame> oh but which do you understand less pat Requiem? or King Crimson?
[1:02:34] <ATentacleMonster> LUL awful
[1:02:34] <jack_s1n> I do
[1:02:35] <cherubsanonymous> NO KILLING
[1:02:36] <BinaryShuffle> Have none of your seen Futurama "Time Keeps Slipping" IT JUST WORKS
[1:02:37] <%ToxInjection> Q U I P S
[1:02:39] <%SuperCasualBoom> Nobody understands it...so Kingdom Hearts?
[1:02:40] <HazeNyne> @AngriestPat show paige the video of the guy flipping his shit over how king crimson works
[1:02:41] <%Ninestempest> Looking up stands doesn't spoil SHIT cause the execution is so fucking bizarre
[1:02:45] <element_of_loyalty> DETAH
[1:02:45] <%Hispanacomida25> It's super easy to explain but alright
[1:02:49] <blackbaron98> deatj
[1:02:52] <pillowwasp> He deletes time
[1:02:58] <Your_Lost_Eraser> SPIDERMAN IS JUST A ZENOMORPH WITH A PHD
[1:03:02] <b1gboss007> Is easy you just have to acept destiny as a concept

[1:03:22] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 3m 23s.
[1:03:25] <%Ninestempest> DID SPIDERMAN JSUT HIT THAT GUY WITH A ROCKET
[1:03:25] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Oh my god, that's the reaction I was expecting!
[1:03:26] <%Remery_> DEAD
[1:03:26] <tacostarvedbeast> paige king crimson HEARS then he SEES
[1:03:28] <Parapattern> I know nothing about JoJo, so you guys may as well be talking a complete different language for me right now.
[1:03:28] <+Dovakhin573> It just fucking works ok
[1:03:29] <ATentacleMonster> Thank you @AlasterAngelo LUL
[1:03:31] <mr_ESB> its easy to understand but explaining and showing is confusing af lool
[1:03:31] <Demon_chann> @AlasterAngelo I DONT UNDERSTAND
[1:03:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Ninestempest sure did
[1:03:33] <element_of_loyalty> Peach needs a live in Nurse.
[1:03:36] <%MisterCrimson> the short version is: it removes causation and skips directly to the result of whatever Diavolo decides
[1:03:37] <pulppedro> I saw some videos trying to explain how it works and it still made no damn sense
[1:03:37] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> It just works
[1:03:40] <%Ninestempest> HOW DOES THAT NOT KILL HIM
[1:03:43] <%NovaKnightmare> King Crimson' main power isnt difficult, its the other one thats hard
[1:03:43] <grayjammer> Its not hard to understand. It's hard to explain
[1:03:43] <%Ninestempest> @ThatGuyfromMars
[1:03:44] <LifesNeverHumDrum> im reading it right now, its not that complicated
[1:03:45] <%altairibnlaahad909> i hope pat gets the 2099 white suit
[1:03:48] <%Agami23> SUPER DEAD IN THAT FIRE
[1:03:50] <LifesNeverHumDrum> it just like skips everyone forward
[1:03:50] <%altairibnlaahad909> best suit
[1:03:56] <lloyddboy> HIS FACE IN THE BARREL FIRE
[1:03:57] <+Dovakhin573> Also I think white album is my favorite stand from 5
[1:04:00] <BMPixy> Did that guy jsut get hit my his friend's rocket?
[1:04:01] <%vaporousTippler> Damn. That's some vintage PA.
[1:04:01] <%Havinstroke> rip jake
[1:04:03] <%deviljhojho94> Kill them all Peter
[1:04:05] <prettypatties97> Oh no he got Jake!
[1:04:07] <RetributionP> PAIGE THIS IS PAT'S STREAM DON'T SHUSH HIM xD
[1:04:09] <Your_Lost_Eraser> KiNG CRIMSON JUST HARNESS THE POWER OF ETMA
[1:04:10] <IminyourBase> oh i understand his powers
[1:04:12] <Jahkota> best suit in the game
[1:04:12] <ATentacleMonster> That outfit is so cool
[1:04:12] <b1gboss007> Is just a lag switch
[1:04:13] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> how are all these people not dead.
[1:04:14] <calder87> don't forget he won't be called King Crimson in the subs either!
[1:04:15] <mr_ESB> i understand it but have a hard time explaining it to people lol
[1:04:15] <prettypatties97> Jake the convict!
[1:04:16] <bearwagon> the problem comes with how Araki applies its power towards the main characters
[1:04:16] <+eldritchbee> Y'all ever have the "ten seconds back" feature on a TV remote? King Crimson does that but forwards
[1:04:24] <tacostarvedbeast> LIAR
[1:04:26] <element_of_loyalty> SHE LIES
[1:04:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Ninestempest ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[1:04:30] <%MisterCrimson> the real confusing part is that King Crimson has a range so try to figure out how that works
[1:04:30] <+Grayhammatter> she actually does? PogChamp
[1:04:32] <element_of_loyalty> INKLING
[1:04:35] <Saltmeisterr> squid?
[1:04:35] <mayorrev> woomy
[1:04:36] <ATentacleMonster> based Paige
[1:04:36] <$ImasukyLomae> tell us the lie
[1:04:38] <pulppedro> @calder87 i hate how Crunchyroll has to change it but I get why
[1:04:38] <RunningNGunning> THIS TASTE OF A LIAR
[1:04:39] <Your_Lost_Eraser> ETMA ASS
[1:04:40] <element_of_loyalty> SPLATOON
[1:04:43] <alcors_wisdom> the TASTE OF A LIAR
[1:04:43] <+SolidusRex> WOOMY
[1:04:46] <$Mendin> It's very similar except there's a difference
[1:04:48] <mayorrev> veemo
[1:04:48] <Demon_chann> 2
[1:04:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> He erases time, he can't hurt anyone in the stopped time because the effects gets erased, he sets himself up in the best possible spot to attack them after time is skipped. He looks at the future with Epitaph to see the future and plan from there. its not that hard
[1:04:51] <ATentacleMonster> It makes total sense!
[1:04:51] <tacostarvedbeast> paige what button on the tv remote is king crimson?
[1:04:52] <Your_Lost_Eraser> 2
[1:04:58] <Nitroustom96> It‚Äôs not that hard Pat
[1:05:00] <+QuadraticGravity> This taste, paige. This is the taste of a LIAR.
[1:05:01] <element_of_loyalty> Peach stop lying,it makes baby Jesus cry.
[1:05:02] <pede2011> IF THING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, NOW IT ISNT
[1:05:04] <sponsoredviewer910> king crimson is just adam sandler's remote in click but it can only fast forward 10 seconds
[1:05:07] <%Hispanacomida25> @eldritchbee That's why I keep saying it's just the skip chapter button on a remote

[1:05:39] <pectusumbra> I'd say its skip yeah
[1:05:40] <gyrogogozeppeli> Pat maybe u should read the manga instead of reading wikis
[1:05:40] <Intolerable> FREEZE FRAME?
[1:05:41] <Sapphire_Breeze> YOU DELETE THE CAUSE BUT EFFECT IS STILL THERE
[1:05:41] <%boratebuffer> What King Crimson does doesn't make sense because araki breaks his own rules in one scene
[1:05:42] <b1gboss007> YES
[1:05:42] <ATentacleMonster> he had a stroke
[1:05:43] <%NuclearLawlocausto> it's skip, but sometimes it isn't skip
[1:05:43] <%DaMexSupaMario> Sounds like some parallel universe shit
[1:05:44] <+eldritchbee> IT'S SKIP PAT
[1:05:44] <%drfaustisdead> King Crimson isn't a button on a remote he's an editing station.
[1:05:44] <Calek> but what about the three shells though?
[1:05:45] <laguerrilha> "He can make people into dinosaurs???"- A friend after i explain the new stand
[1:05:45] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> It's both skip and not skip
[1:05:45] <mr_ESB> A MESS
[1:05:45] <element_of_loyalty> MERCI
[1:05:47] <SailingSaturn> can't even read chat NotLikeThis
[1:05:48] <%NuclearLawlocausto> because araki
[1:05:49] <%deviljhojho94> IT JUST WORKS
[1:05:49] <%altairibnlaahad909> CRAZY TALK ACTIVATE
[1:05:50] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Pat it would be a good idea to dodge after webzipping to a sword dude
[1:05:53] <%NovaKnightmare> HOW DARE YOU PAT
[1:05:53] <$TheNeedlesD> Sleep Mode
[1:05:54] <Recthel> if it wasn't a meme to not understand king crimson everybody would get it
[1:05:54] <Zeemod155> What are they talking about?
[1:05:56] <mr_slaide> It's kind of a skip... but it's not.
[1:05:58] <gyrogogozeppeli> Maybe read the manga and not wikis
[1:05:59] <Your_Lost_Eraser> HE SEES THE SHIT THEN JUST TEEVO'S IT FORWARD
[1:06:01] <+WheatlyXT> It‚Äôs chapter select
[1:06:01] <zakti_prime> !uptime
[1:06:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 1h 6m 3s.
[1:06:03] <alcors_wisdom> its skip if youre using the OTHER tv remote
[1:06:03] <%ThatGuyfromMars> FUUUUCK BEST SUIT
[1:06:03] <element_of_loyalty> CRIMES
[1:06:04] <AzureKayZ> KING CRIMSON WORKS LIKE HIT'S TIME SKIP
[1:06:07] <FrxstyFrxst> King Crimson is incognito mode in real life
[1:06:07] <pectusumbra> oh yeah, we need a crossover with Sauron getting THAT stand
[1:06:07] <$magikestral> as i said, KC isn't hard to understand, its just inconsistent.
[1:06:08] <StarryNightRainy> IT'S LITERALLY JUST THE FUTURAMA EPISODE "TIME KEEPS ON SLIPPIN"
[1:06:08] <mr_slaide> We're talking King Crimson and how it totally works.
[1:06:08] <demongirl986> like i said, it's bad video editing!
[1:06:08] <$Mendin> It's Pause-Unpause-Pause-Unpause
[1:06:08] <AlasterAngelo> @laguerrilha but I don't want to turn people into dinosaurs, I want to cure cancer
[1:06:09] <prettypatties97> Pat you're stand is literally about being wrong, why are you saying the chat is wrong?
[1:06:10] <GreatSmasherPunch> it's Windows movie maker
[1:06:10] <+oOZtkOo> ITS EDITING SOFTWARE
[1:06:11] <pede2011> PAT YOU JUST SKIM OVER WIKI ARTICLES, I DONT REALLY TRUST YOU
[1:06:12] <+Grayhammatter> holy shit, you need big crymes for that one
[1:06:12] <+BloodborneSammich> King Crimson is what I named my blue car
[1:06:12] <Your_Lost_Eraser> BASICALLY WHAT A DVR CAN DO
[1:06:12] <dsauce999> It is a skip but he can freely move inside the skip
[1:06:13] <%Agami23> and theres another insanely OP stand in part 5 that is the repeat button on a remote
[1:06:16] <+TastySammiches> its cryme tyme
[1:06:17] <baronvonkame> King Crimson is half of the best song in FFXIV Forward and Forward and Forward then take one step forward
[1:06:18] <bearwagon> its skip if one Person had the ability to remember and move around in the Skipped portion
[1:06:19] <element_of_loyalty> Peach is still googling
[1:06:21] <+BaronEgo> Skip is accurate
[1:06:21] <ape_hawk> its like when you have two tracks in your editing timeline, and you delete one, but it still shows up in the finished product
[1:06:23] <Kavtech> Interact with crimes.
[1:06:23] <Them00n> PAT UNLOCK THAT LAST STAND SUIT YOU FUCK
[1:06:24] <sleepy_coffee> Wait if pat likes crimes so much, why isn't he on Cryme Time?
[1:06:24] <masterfire23> it's like previewing when you fast forward
[1:06:25] <sponsoredviewer910> spiderman is a menace
[1:06:26] <b1gboss007> Skips to everyone exept the user
[1:06:26] <%Hispanacomida25> It's totally a skip, but it keeps all the effects of the parts that was skipped
[1:06:29] <$magikestral> i can't wait for the anime to make it super duper clear
[1:06:30] <element_of_loyalty> SHE FOUND PORN
[1:06:30] <mr_ESB> anime only folks are going to be mindf*cked o_O
[1:06:31] <demongirl986> stuff happens, but you only get to see what happens afterwards!
[1:06:31] <%Ninestempest> @StarryNightRainy first they copy xmen, then jojo part 5, when will futurama stop predicting the future
[1:06:32] <FrxstyFrxst> KING CRIMSON = INCOGNITO MODE

[1:11:47] <+MMetas> King Crimson has the power of taking a pocket of time and erasing all things within that pocket of time, sort of folding it like space time so that the action cuts together in an instant, the victim has no memory of doing the things they did in the time and has to adjust while king crimson see's it as a break in the timeline

[1:16:27] <%AncelDeLambert> cheer200 Pat, you're super wrong about the spider thing. Spiders have two types of webs, a sticky or fluffy type that catches the prey, and a dry structural type that they actually walk on. The spider doesn't walk on the sticky part of its own web. It also climbs walls by just GRABBING it with its tiny little claws, just like a mountain climber. Paige, be sure not to show Pat your felony titty. 11111111111

[1:26:35] <CatmanIX> Latrodectus Geometricus, commonly known as the Brown Widow
[1:26:39] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Brown Recluses are scary
[1:26:39] <PettyFunk> Brown Recluse is the NEET spider-man
[1:26:40] <%nitronLVIII> "This Ninja Themed restaurant is under the protection of the Brown Widow"
[1:26:40] <element_of_loyalty> THEY ARE VERY DEADLY

[1:26:44] <AlasterAngelo> brown recluses are recluses for a reason
[1:26:46] <%AncelDeLambert> this is just open warfare in New York
[1:26:47] <prettypatties97> Whelp, time to google Brown Widows
[1:26:48] <$TrashNebula5k> Fun fact: Brown widows are way more deadly than black widows cause no one ever recognizes them as widows.
[1:26:49] <+Dovakhin573> Max almost died after being bitten by a black widdoe
[1:26:52] <%Paralurx> Not an insect, an arachnid

[1:27:04] <element_of_loyalty> LIES
[1:27:04] <%rdark_ksu> fun fact about the brown recluse. It is now believed that the necrotic damange likely comes from a form of mrsa or staff they carry and not the venom itself
[1:27:06] <gyrogogozeppeli> No you wont LUL

[1:27:27] <%SuperCasualBoom> Paige‚Äôs kryptonite is Honey Nut Cheerios
[1:27:29] <grayjammer> Fun Fact! Most "Brown Recluse bites" are actually just infected cuts. Brown recluses aren't as dangerous as people think.

[1:43:30] <KayThree> Just Gwen Stacy her off the planet like good old Ditko would've wanted
[1:43:31] <SecretAgentPickles> Lol, I get what he meant though. Playing dangerous
[1:43:31] <Estuko> @Paralurx it was very hard for me to not wear the MK2 armour suit, the black/yellow one with the popped out collar. Lol
[1:43:31] <Parapattern> BOTH
[1:43:31] <zagardal> Paige is all about balding redheads, the rest are too much for her
[1:43:31] <AlasterAngelo> that's literally what she's doing though she keeps getting into suicidal situations
[1:43:32] <%Fenrirlives> well she does sneak onto dangerous sites with little protection
[1:43:32] <$Mendin> Give her a bullet and a clip. Give *clap* MJ *clap* A *clap* Gun *clap*

[1:43:34] <alcors_wisdom> wow paige do you hate MJ because you HATE WYMVN
[1:43:34] <%SuperCasualBoom> MJ needs a neck massage
[1:43:37] <ape_hawk> like, yuri and sable lady are strong and smart
[1:43:38] <+Meekest> Paige is VERY strong and she needs to be stopped
[1:43:38] <%AncelDeLambert> MJ has had eight years of her boyfriend doing this shit to learn better
[1:43:38] <b1gboss007> I mean he Isn't wrong
[1:43:39] <+Nomicro4u> Paige sees MJ as competition
[1:43:40] <shlaggori> a radioactive semen bullet
[1:43:41] <KnivesEve> ONE MORE DAY CONFORMED
[1:43:43] <+Devilbringer133> You can be intelligent and very dumb
[1:43:46] <gyrogogozeppeli> Paige is just jealous
[1:43:48] <%ToxInjection> I dunno. To me, the stubbornness makes sense when I consider her and MJ have a past.
[1:43:48] <CatmanIX> she literally is just asking for a bullet when she's skulking around criminal hideouts with absolutely no way to defend herself
[1:43:50] <%PipIV> There's being courageous and then there's being stupid
[1:43:51] <Demon_chann> She just want to be a hero and thats dumb
[1:43:51] <zamzoph> she knows she has PLOT ARMOR cuz she's not Gwen Stacy
[1:43:51] <Hawkbone_> She successfully snuck into a private military camp
[1:43:52] <+LogothX> IM HELPING
[1:43:52] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @AngriestPat So too dumb to live-type dumb?
[1:43:52] <%AncelDeLambert> I expect MJ to be more savvy after EIGHT YEARS
[1:43:52] <+fFailureatlife> THATS WHAT SHES TRYING
[1:43:53] <+khalcipher> She has almost the same characterization as Miles!!!!
[1:43:54] <hyphenated_q> Paige just hates other red headed women
[1:43:56] <+mechslayer71> And MJ in the comics isn‚Äôt useless? @angriestpat
[1:43:56] <%Remery_> She snuck into a mercenary camp -.-
[1:43:56] <gyrogogozeppeli> BECAUSE SHES DISABLED
[1:43:56] <element_of_loyalty> ORCO?

[1:43:59] <+SuichiTanaka> BAT THING
[1:44:00] <pillowwasp> Strong vs arrogant
[1:44:00] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> That's my problem
[1:44:00] <+redeq2> CHANGE MJ WITH THE GIRL FROM BORDERLANDS
[1:44:01] <Thomas100273> MJ Acts like she has super powers but she isn't even strong for a normal woman.
[1:44:01] <devanmuse> I can understand MJ's position. Think about it: If Peter Parker didn't have his powers, do you really think he would quit saving people?
[1:44:02] <aiyobro> spider man has harlequin fetus'
[1:44:03] <ape_hawk> yeah, when she was in a wheelchair!
[1:44:03] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> JUST BE ORACLE
[1:44:08] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> Oracle is so useful
[1:44:08] <alcors_wisdom> well DC has sensible characters
[1:44:10] <Stebdavee> She has no fighting experience
[1:44:11] <energywarning> how many dudes were in that shed?
[1:44:12] <leinadtonu> Urkle?
[1:44:12] <Hellarussian> but oracle is good with technology
[1:44:15] <%ToxInjection> and I mean... none of the characters know they're in a comic universe. She's acting just like a reporter in this universe would
[1:44:15] <Parapattern> ORACLE TAKES MOTHERFUCKERS OUT WHILE IN A WHEELCHAIR
[1:44:16] <$MLG_Bear_Simulator> MJ needs to be a Computer Chair Guy
[1:44:16] <Estuko> ! GLITCH !
[1:44:17] <gyrogogozeppeli> Thats why she wasnt fighting
[1:44:18] <%Ragnarok_Flames> do we forget that Peter is still homeless
[1:44:19] <%deviljhojho94> oh, oracle LUL
[1:44:19] <vivecdidnothingwrong> OH NO

[1:44:25] <element_of_loyalty> BARBARA GORDON

[1:44:27] <ProRJHunter> F
[1:44:30] <Pizza47> LUL
[1:44:31] <+LogothX> SPIDERMAN has never KILLED ANYONE
[1:44:31] <Your_Lost_Eraser> F
[1:44:33] <%BioApple> every time paige says "disabled" I just want her to say "i'm disabled" in that accent again
[1:44:34] <sosuke5> MJ is just Deku
[1:44:34] <alexandrecau> mj is disable too
[1:44:34] <+Grayhammatter> i can't believe he is dead
[1:44:35] <alcors_wisdom> so MJ should catch a bullet? thats what oracle did
[1:44:36] <LiquidMathew> MJ just pissed she had to be rescued for 8 years and wants to do the cool thing
[1:44:36] <+CaptainJax> no she cant
[1:44:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> MIles is doing the same thing
[1:44:36] <laguerrilha> And then she didnt.
[1:44:37] <wsintai> Paige loves it when women get DISABLED @AngriestPat
[1:44:37] <%goose_attack_almanac> Well it's not like she can do anything else from a wheelchair
[1:44:38] <element_of_loyalty> MJ IS A CONT
[1:44:38] <$ImasukyLomae> Yeah by hacking not going into danger
[1:44:38] <+Survivor_Seven> She became a leader
[1:44:39] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Paige just likes Oracle cause joke gave her an abortion.
[1:44:39] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> "That guy just got killed!" *Kills him more*
[1:44:41] <AlasterAngelo> Oracle was the only time Barbara Gordon was good
[1:44:41] <%deviljhojho94> RADIOACTIVE SPIDER SEMEN

[1:44:47] <Your_Lost_Eraser> RADIOACTIVE SPIDERNUT
[1:44:48] <$magikestral> MJ can be helpful if the game gave her better scenarios
[1:44:49] <+intothfanfiction> Maybe MJ being around spiderman changed her view of the world. maybe thats why she is a reporter
[1:44:51] <+TastySammiches> those quips are so bad
[1:44:54] <+Gorgen> maybe if Mj had the lupus super power she would be more helpful
[1:44:55] <%korth367> spiderman is basically kiryu when it comes to killing people
[1:44:59] <%Quigsies> I mean to be fair Pat, it is their headquarters
[1:45:00] <gyrogogozeppeli> Did we forget that Miles went off to fight these guys?
[1:45:00] <%Meme_Platinum> how does MJ get killed by semen? the semen shouldn't be radioactive anymore
[1:45:01] <+jakeprotagonist_> She‚Äôs not even in a helping people business she works for the bugle not FEAST. If you wanna help people then do it bitch
[1:45:01] <turf_wind_and_fire> I mean you are storming one of their bases pat
[1:45:01] <Thomas100273> This is when you switch to web blossom.

[1:45:10] <SatansDick1> she became spider gwen
[1:45:11] <mayorrev> SPIDER GWEN THO

[1:45:16] <sileo_patronus> Fucked osborn
[1:45:16] <%Gogogolem> @AngriestPat Gwen stacy was a highschool student like 16 and as smart as peter.
[1:45:17] <+mechslayer71> @alcors_wisdom DC? Sensible characters? In the world based around ‚Äúlet mass murderers live over and over so they can break out and kill more people‚Äù? Really?
[1:45:17] <%Paralurx> She was in college and was big smart
[1:45:17] <%PipIV> she died I College
[1:45:17] <+fFailureatlife> SPIDER GWEN SUCKS
[1:45:19] <+YabbaTroll> she was in a band?
[1:45:19] <%Meme_Platinum> radiation will radiate away, that's what it does
[1:45:21] <alcors_wisdom> depends but sometimes she works at the lab
[1:45:21] <mrjohncarlton> Her job title is "Corpse"
[1:45:21] <%Agami23> she fucked green goblin when in high school
[1:45:23] <%ssjklyco> Baby maker was her job
[1:45:23] <+Grayhammatter> she got SUPER deaded
[1:45:23] <+Meekest> She fucked Norman Osborn
[1:45:25] <%altairibnlaahad909> spider gwen is more or less more memorable now than og gwen
[1:45:26] <%Havinstroke> so is it an unpopular opinion to say that Arkham's combat seems much more fun than this game's?
[1:45:28] <+ryujinran> we don't talk about the osborn NTR that shit ain't cannon
[1:45:29] <%commanderclaw> She died because someone had a snuff fetish
[1:45:31] <zakti_prime> @mistercrimson it's called fridging
[1:45:31] <Demon_chann> gwen sexed norman
[1:45:32] <alcors_wisdom> oh yeah she was also an actor
[1:45:32] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @MisterCrimson Like a more confident Otacon?
[1:45:32] <WizoSavage> in this universe?
[1:45:32] <gyrogogozeppeli> tell that to Green Lantern LUL
[1:45:33] <prettypatties97> I think it's worse with MJ, because at least Miles wasn't being snarky about his dumb, impulsive decision
[1:45:33] <%Solidus_113> can we4 get a new game with the Madame Web multiverse?
[1:45:33] <troxcree> Her defining trait is that Peter snapped her neck.
[1:45:34] <god__of__lore> College
[1:45:36] <+SuichiTanaka> Use Electric attacks
[1:45:36] <+in_spaaace> She fucked Norman and had his kids
[1:45:37] <$MightyMaxT> I respect that you dislike her even though I disagree. I feel like she will be better now that they talked about her recklessness
[1:45:37] <CanadianAdam> ELECTRIC WEB
[1:45:37] <EMP_Ike_Turner> didn't she get cloned too once
[1:45:38] <XHeavyfireX> MJ's fault in this game is just that it doesn't use her well.
[1:45:38] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Gwen's death is generally a defining moment in Peter's jurony to becoming spiderman
[1:45:38] <+nbslect0r> being norman osborn's baby momma
[1:45:39] <Stebdavee> Remider that Gwen had kids with Norman Osborn
[1:45:39] <+Grayhammatter> just use electric web?
[1:45:40] <Klarrann3> shock them @AngriestPat
[1:45:40] <zamzoph> and now you can't do that again because "muh fridging"
[1:45:40] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Gwen Stacy was Peter
[1:45:41] <KnivesEve> she was also into ntr
[1:45:41] <alexandrecau> she made a young corpse
[1:45:45] <SuperNotSuspiciousMan> My only problem with this MJ is that she's kind of too naive and hopeful. She's a reporter and known the shit Spidey's done for 8 years already ffs

[1:47:33] <ptmpopulatethemoon> @angriestpat MJ in this game is already doing enough right now in this game. She's actually a very great reporter, does her duty as a journalist and researches topics properly and speaks truth to power. But the fact that she constantly gets mad at Peter for constantly being worried about her, even though SHE is the one who puts herself into these positions is SUEPR unfair to Peter.

[1:47:35] <%goose_attack_almanac> @AngriestPat Gwen Stacy is Peter's College Love Interest. Big Smart girl. Eventually some writer went off the cuff and tried to write a storyline that had Norman Osborn have sex with her. That was eventually rewritten because literally everyone said it was stupid as shit.

[1:48:21] <+TheRaveous> isn't it second cousins?
[1:48:22] <zal_silverfang> BIG WRONG

[1:48:24] <%deviljhojho94> PIZZA TIME
[1:48:24] <mayorrev> pizza time
[1:48:25] <Parapattern> WHere we can marry our attractive cousins
[1:48:27] <%superorangerobin> What you've heard
[1:48:27] <+redstonej> that;s your excuse
[1:48:27] <zamzoph> that's why it's okay in anime
[1:48:29] <Mr_Strut> That's why pat and paige are okay
[1:48:30] <+fFailureatlife> PIZZA TIME
[1:48:34] <+TsunamiPoro> pat thats wrong its still super bad if its not atleast 3rd cousins
[1:48:35] <%rdark_ksu> Incest is like compounding interest. It gets worse the more ya do it
[1:48:37] <+redeq2> U MUST BE NEW
[1:48:39] <+Bupkis7> No, pat's right
[1:48:40] <%Cynful_Pleasures> There's no bigger risk of a birth defect than if the woman is over 40
[1:48:40] <+LogothX> The Staten Island Ferry is a pile of shit
[1:48:41] <element_of_loyalty> MJ is worse that MOHU handler
[1:48:41] <%deviljhojho94> TRALA TRALA TRALALALALA
[1:48:42] <%altairibnlaahad909> @goose_attack_almanac actually that was not rewritten, its still canon. gwen was originally just peter's love interest in the original stories, then during a JMS run around 2002 or so thats when it was retconned that she cheated on peter with norman osborn
[1:48:43] <@PlagueOfGripes> genetically you have almost nothing in common with your grandparents anyway. so the separation happens pretty fast
[1:48:44] <leinadtonu> Tell that to Pat's cousins
[1:48:45] <%commanderclaw> What the fuck will Harry's role be in the sequel?
[1:48:46] <%altairibnlaahad909> it was a baaaaaaad story
[1:48:46] <Zombrocom> Risk with siblings/parents is like 50%, cousins, is like 4%, unrelated is like 2%. So cousins double risk of birth defects
[1:48:47] <baronvonkame> I mean the real problem with incest is overlap without new genes being introduced, so your aunt (or uncle) makes enough diversity I guess?
[1:48:48] <+jjjkopf> Pat is there something you want to tell us
[1:48:49] <element_of_loyalty> STFU GINGER
[1:48:50] <ape_hawk> PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO PAT ABOUT GENETICS, HE HAS THE SAME GRASP ON THE SUBJECT AS LIQUID SNAKE

[1:48:52] <%AncelDeLambert> "We"?
[1:48:53] <gyrogogozeppeli> Adulting is hard
[1:48:53] <+khalcipher> INCEST TIME i mean PIZZA TIME
[1:48:55] <+Grayhammatter> adulting is the worst
[1:48:57] <+TastySammiches> genetically speaking you shouldnt bone your first cousin either, second cousin isnt as bad
[1:48:59] <pillowwasp> Cousin is fine unless it's repeated
[1:49:00] <%deviljhojho94> @Estuko Ye

[1:49:31] <%superorangerobin> Because that's what she does
[1:49:33] <zagardal> the problem with incest is repetition, not proximity. Unless there's some real rotten shit in your genes, fucking your sister is not as bad for your offspring as cousins fucking each other generation after generation with no change in the gene pool.

[1:53:25] <+Sdeje> cheer400 Pat, if you lived in the Marvel Universe would you rather be in a large city or a small city? Large Cities seem to have bigger and more events, but more heroes to deal with them. Small cities seem quiet but have a chance to be randomly wiped out instantly like how the New Warriors accidentally let Nitro blow up a school in Civil War.
[1:53:25] <+SolidusRex> Pat is a Sesame Street character

[2:23:09] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 hey guys, been a bit, dying from school, work, and illness. Gimmie my usual TTS/Paige shill stream update. I have a pretty good indie game for her to play, called "EBF" (epic battle fantasy) there are 4, and the 5th is almost out. I'd reccomend starting with 3 though, as the first 2 are more like long chains of battles. Pretty funny, and a nice middle length (unlike pat)

[2:28:14] <wsintai> @DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap Don't pretend it makes sense
[2:28:15] <%ToxInjection> Spoiler: The weakness is electricity
[2:28:18] <AtlasMcCoy> You know what would be a weakness? Bullets. Bombs.
[2:28:20] <Heiru> "Interesting.. no wait, the other thing.. "

[2:28:23] <Bouldus> would be a shame if i,... stole this shit
[2:28:24] <%SaltyDongs> No weakness
[2:28:25] <+Extrallent> a big weakness is their guns cant kill anything
[2:28:25] <thisisacoolguy> I know when I'm mad at my teacher I write BIG SHIT HEAD in red marker on it
[2:28:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> He was a sick son of a bitch
[2:28:27] <element_of_loyalty> JESUS PEACH
[2:28:27] <%AncelDeLambert> BOOOOO
[2:28:29] <Mr_Strut> The weakness is to hit it really hard.
[2:28:35] <gyrogogozeppeli> Kraven's the first?
[2:28:35] <FaytLeingodz> whos the first?
[2:28:37] <%altairibnlaahad909> @AngriestPat to be fair the guy shot by Superior Spider-Man was a killer who killed a shitton of people before otto was like "no more killing. after this one last death"
[2:28:39] <pabloelenano2> kraven
[2:28:41] <$TheNeedlesD> in general
[2:28:42] <R3c0n31> This one impressed me
[2:28:43] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> I'm not, it's just I remember that's their dumb comic science behind it.
[2:28:44] <AlasterAngelo> his favorite russian is, of course, Putin
[2:28:45] <%ToxInjection> I don't know who that's a reference to. Black Widow?
[2:28:46] <%goose_attack_almanac> All versions
[2:28:53] <zal_silverfang> wait, so who is peter's first favorite russian?
[2:28:55] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> This Rhino is literally just trying to free himself from the suit
[2:28:55] <turf_wind_and_fire> He shits himself
[2:28:57] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @angriestpat there were more recordings on the first recorder
[2:28:57] <$Sdeje> Poops in the suit
[2:28:57] <%AncelDeLambert> wasn't it always his thing that the arms were fused to his spine?
[2:28:58] <%PipIV> Kraven has beaten Peter
[2:28:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Colossus maybe?
[2:28:59] <Demon_chann> @altairibnlaahad909 thats why hes rad
[2:28:59] <element_of_loyalty> out his asss

[2:29:08] <gyrogogozeppeli> No Ock, he's just dumb
[2:29:10] <%spacekataz18> Paige it's like that scene from Ace Ventura
[2:29:12] <wsintai> @zal_silverfang Probably Kraven? I dunno
[2:29:13] <%rdark_ksu> Fisk is also fun. He is literally a self made man/ master criminal
[2:29:16] <ape_hawk> paige, remember that rhino suit scene from ace ventura
[2:29:18] <ape_hawk> its like that
[2:29:19] <%spacekataz18> Both when he needs to poop and when he needs to get out of the suit
[2:29:19] <+LogothX> In the Spider Man cartoon Rhino was from New Jersey
[2:29:23] <deersuplexer> Good deal
[2:29:24] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat Rhinos shit builds up in his suit and its up to his neck, thats why he wants out, he's floating in his own shit in a rhino costume
[2:29:24] <TheUltrahumanoid> It‚Äôs a flap with a hinge
[2:29:28] <gyrogogozeppeli> Aka Second Venom
[2:29:28] <%AncelDeLambert> Fisk is Bane without the venom
[2:29:29] <AtlasMcCoy> gottem

[2:29:36] <turf_wind_and_fire> Literally
[2:29:38] <%Jpdodds> he is a scorpion
[2:29:38] <AliveAleks> AKA Pat
[2:29:40] <XHeavyfireX> Scorpion is a MASSIVE asshole
[2:29:41] <EMP_Ike_Turner> remember when he was venom
[2:29:44] <mrjohncarlton> Gargan is also worst Venom
[2:29:44] <+WhyIDie> because spider vs scorpion
[2:29:45] <turf_wind_and_fire> And then he was the WORST Venom
[2:29:45] <element_of_loyalty> J.J.J. DADDY

[3:03:28] <Heiru> It should read, "Have 5 enemies electrocuted at the same time", the "at once" is a bit misleading

[3:03:46] <laguerrilha> or helps
[3:03:47] <cherubsanonymous> It's almost like Spider-Man is more fun to play as than Batman
[3:03:47] <Hawkbone_> In arkham knight there was that same thing
[3:03:51] <+DFDEDSDCD> spider-bro makes those "electrify x enemies" challenges a non-issue
[3:03:54] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @Havinstroke yeah you must be having a stroke
[3:03:55] <dewyweb> @Havinstroke your name suits that statement
[3:03:57] <miguelrod777> that dialogue was actual important

[3:04:43] <SubliminaIMessages> Brute smarts eh?

[3:05:29] <LifesNeverHumDrum> social eat-fucking?
[3:05:30] <element_of_loyalty> erats
[3:05:30] <CryptusMaximus> Yeah the combat in Batman is so bad that half a generation of games keep borrowing it.
[3:05:31] <%MagickBurritoh> batman combat is just pressing Y
[3:05:31] <Arek_1> @baronvonkame Yeah, I had an automated blood donation. They use a centrifuge to spin your blood and separate plasma from blood cells. This way, they take a little from you, separate it, take what's necessary (I think it was plasma), return the (blood cell?) with a saline solution, and do it again. Taking less blood from you but gaining more of what's necessary. Genius stuff.
[3:05:32] <%whistlehunter> social spoderman
[3:05:34] <faldin> batman combat is waiting to counter everyone and winning
[3:05:35] <TheBlankAce> They got rid of it
[3:05:36] <$GohanEgret> FOOD
[3:05:39] <bruno_silv0> batman combat isnt bad, but its nothing special tbh

[3:05:54] <Hawkbone_> @altairibnlaahad909 Apparently western games cannot be good, according to this xenophobe
[3:06:04] <cafarun> makes hte dlivery man wait while he fucks around on twitch
[3:06:06] <%Havinstroke> nah I haven't played this game but I have noticed the total of 5 animations it has for finishers
[3:06:07] <%xemnahort> 1
[3:06:09] <b1gboss007> people that say that batman combat is just presing a button never played a batman game
[3:06:11] <%altairibnlaahad909> @Hawkbone_ western devs are better at some things, and japanese devs are better at other things.
[3:06:11] <buffmurffy> honestly darksiders 2 has better combat than batman
[3:06:12] <+LtShuckle> the remote grapple in arkham origins is the best gadget ever
[3:06:14] <+Vfdvolunteer> 12

[3:06:22] <Vroom0> just do irl
[3:06:22] <+mechslayer71> @gyrogogozeppeli if his stream were more than 50%gameplay he could. But they never are, so he wont
[3:06:23] <Arclight2879> Didn't twitch change its settings?
[3:06:24] <LifesNeverHumDrum> no way, mukbangs are still a thing
[3:06:29] <%xemnahort> do we need to make 5 twitch's fault?
[3:06:31] <turf_wind_and_fire> Do it as a joke!
[3:06:33] <%AncelDeLambert> @LtShuckle good for a chuckle, ye
[3:06:33] <LifesNeverHumDrum> bang that muk
[3:06:33] <miguelrod777> xenophobe implies foriegn so western games can be xeno
[3:06:36] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @Havinstroke so clearly it doesnt flow very well

[3:06:53] <tungstenviper> twitch doesn't allow food and drinks anymore
[3:06:53] <HoIlywood_SN> Japanese devs i find to be better at balancing cinematic flare with being an actual game
[3:06:55] <GrampsGrubberfly> i came here for spiderman
[3:06:55] <tungstenviper> LUL
[3:06:59] <+jayfigga> Fortnite with the boiz

[3:07:06] <%Havinstroke> yeah I should look up someone good playing this game but that is just another gripe I have with this game

[3:07:57] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I mean, I can just go to pronhub tho
[3:08:00] <+FrostMass22> Personally I think it's dumb because they act moral and have really archaic rules BUT they allow nude painting

[3:20:08] <element_of_loyalty> SPIDER SENSES
[3:20:09] <%ToxInjection> x1000
[3:20:11] <%altairibnlaahad909> real life spider sense
[3:20:12] <EMP_Ike_Turner> that's why his mask eyes narrow its to prevent sensory oveload
[3:20:14] <%TrevyWeaponsGuy> He just doesn't care
[3:20:16] <person181> spiders should die and make something better could come in there place
[3:20:19] <Estuko> If they're so good then why can I just punch them through the wall LUL
[3:20:21] <circular7> nice shirt pat
[3:20:28] <Arek_1> Spiders don't get dizzy because they don't have inner ear fluids like humans do.
[3:20:31] <bearwagon> what a strong ability, especially for those fucking jumping spiders
[3:20:31] <%altairibnlaahad909> in the comics, the spider-sense is actually neutered precog
[3:20:33] <%ToxInjection> DAMN
[3:20:37] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @person181 but what if we get something worse instead?
[3:20:40] <+BigRooster83> Mary from Silent Hill 2 or Heather from SH3

[3:20:52] <Ropcord> WutFace
[3:20:52] <%rdark_ksu> Spiders need a nerf
[3:20:53] <%altairibnlaahad909> spider-man's clone Kaine has all of his powers amped up to 11, so his wall grip actually burns into things and his spider-sense is actual precog
[3:20:55] <HoIlywood_SN> Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099, actually doesnt have the classic Spider-Sense but his senses are so acute that it functions the same. Spider-Man 2099 as a whole has better powers and they make way more sense in genera
[3:20:57] <@SpaceCaptainCrone> Spiders are Mary Sues confirmed.
[3:20:59] <element_of_loyalty> PEACH EMBRACE THE SCIENCE

[3:36:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> raise your voice louder Miles

[3:37:15] <JDebss> Fuck Miles
[3:37:16] <+imextremelymanly> Miles not a killer like Peter
[3:37:17] <%bloodypurpledog> MILES IS SANS

[3:37:18] <+Quarkee> miles is wearing a sans jacket
[3:37:19] <%rdark_ksu> Miles is like 15. Murder would be a tad traumatic
[3:37:19] <SatansDick1> with no powers
[3:37:21] <+WhyIDie> why would you assume miles can do stealth kills cmonBruh
[3:37:22] <bambowl> cause miles is wholesome @angriestpat
[3:37:24] <+Reevesypoo> Miles did kill that one guy in that one comic once

[3:37:59] <+Gorgen> Oh boy
[3:37:59] <%Agami23> theres a very obvious reason for the next game to be both a miles morales game AND a venom game
[3:38:00] <$RaikenTB> He's kind of a cunt right after his dad dies.
[3:38:01] <Mr_Strut> Miles is a trash fire

[3:38:08] <HoIlywood_SN> Paige for reference, comic Miles is very boring and shittily written because his writer, Bendis, just fucking gave up being a good writer like 8 years ago
[3:38:08] <%AncelDeLambert> he's pretty fucking stupid right here

[3:38:56] <laguerrilha> Comics Milles is good, dont get the hate
[3:38:57] <JDebss> Fuck Miles
[3:38:58] <person181> how does he sleep like that?
[3:38:59] <%GarbageNirvana> Wonder how Spiderverse Miles is gonna turn out
[3:39:00] <+imextremelymanly> I guess chat is not going to watch that new spiderman movie featuring Miles
[3:39:01] <zamzoph> GENTLEMEN
[3:39:02] <+Reevesypoo> Rhino and Scorpion are my favorite!!!!
[3:39:03] <%ToxInjection> LOOK AT THESE JOBBERS
[3:39:05] <XHeavyfireX> The chat can be very wrong
[3:39:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I like this Rhino.
[3:39:11] <%ToxInjection> or Scorpion at least
[3:39:11] <Justhere4kicks> The fight has begun!
[3:39:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Yep, feeling all those Vulpes-vibes from Scorpion...
[3:39:12] <Estuko> WutFace
[3:39:12] <bambowl> ITS THE FURRIES
[3:39:13] <element_of_loyalty> DEATH
[3:39:14] <Spheraph> Scorpion looks like an F-Zero racer
[3:39:14] <moonslair> im paled
[3:39:15] <Nova712> Yea, this scorpion is actually pretty awesome
[3:39:16] <sileo_patronus> @RaikenTB if you aren't going to allow a slip in times of harsh trauma then when?
[3:39:18] <Hidashi13> SCORPION!
[3:39:19] <dalishprince> miles vs the furries
[3:39:20] <laguerrilha> The suit is great
[3:39:21] <+Winnosh> Yeah Miles is Super Super Popular
[3:39:22] <LiquidMathew> Scorpion in Battle Armor is always a great idea
[3:39:22] <mister_z_1994> Don't know why he took vernacular lessons from Poison Ivy though
[3:39:23] <FrostySnowQueen> yes just take two bottles
[3:39:24] <burning_drake> sum ppl whining cause nuthin
[3:39:24] <tyrano_the_wise> those guys are ded
[3:39:25] <FrostySnowQueen> thats enough
[3:39:25] <+FrostMass22> @gyrogogozeppeli Because she puts herself in danger with absolutely no back up and when she doesn't even need to do anything. Spiderman could have done everything MJ did and would not be in mortal danger.
[3:39:26] <+ryujinran> problem with comic miles is that personality wise he doesn't do much to distinguish himself from peter
[3:39:26] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> ALL THAT FOR TWO BOTTLES
[3:39:26] <extradopeness> Miles is A GOOD BOY
[3:39:26] <AtlasMcCoy> FUCKIN RIP
[3:39:27] <alexandrecau> vaas is scorpion
[3:39:27] <EMP_Ike_Turner> super run away
[3:39:27] <Nova712> I liked all of them better than previous ones tbh
[3:39:29] <reonome> two bottles miles, really
[3:39:29] <+Grayhammatter> RIP
[3:39:33] <HoIlywood_SN> i'll always be a fan of Scorpions late 90s design that was used in the PS1 game and the first Movie game, where it was blue
[3:39:34] <mercado94> thanks h boy
[3:39:35] <crimsonharvest> man thats like 15,000 pills of Amoxyl they're gonna be good for a while
[3:39:36] <SunnyD_Solaire> GJ MILES
[3:39:36] <person181> grabe the case not ONE BOTTLE
[3:39:39] <LiquidMathew> Rhino is fucking huge
[3:39:40] <+tigerfang86> CAUSE HE'S SO BUFF
[3:39:41] <shlaggori> HOW DOES RHINO POOP
[3:39:42] <mercado94> wat
[3:39:44] <vivecdidnothingwrong> He'd die if he was entirely covered
[3:39:44] <Hawkbone_> Rhino is a very large man
[3:39:45] <%AncelDeLambert> @person181 right?
[3:39:45] <element_of_loyalty> GET CAUGHT ONCE
[3:39:46] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> He don't care, he's too strong to care
[3:39:48] <Spheraph> When people start dying, Miles gets flying
[3:39:48] <wunderkonig> ....
[3:39:49] <+Quarkee> because rhino is too fucking strong to care about exposed flesh
[3:39:49] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat its basically alot of little plates welded on to his flesh
[3:39:50] <iwa5h4ck3d> Its aesthetic
[3:39:51] <MonsieurHedge> hes a weird mutant in this world i guess?
[3:39:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's stuck in it. And he's trying to get it off.
[3:39:55] <HoIlywood_SN> @AngriestPat the suit in this is integrated into his body, look at his shoulders and you can see the tubes go into his flesh
[3:39:56] <zamzoph> how does he poop?
[3:39:59] <%ToxInjection> LUL
[3:39:59] <MetelStar> Out of all the villains to be sneaking by...
[3:39:59] <+tigerfang86> FUN WITH HIS FACE
[3:40:00] <wunderkonig> Why didn't Mj give Miles some spidey lures?
[3:40:02] <xddddsorandom> HOW DID HE SEE THAT LIGHT
[3:40:02] <JDebss> Rhino is russian now?
[3:40:03] <$Mendin> Is Rhino Rusev?
[3:40:04] <+scorpiozilla> He has powers without suit
[3:40:05] <element_of_loyalty> RUSSIAN
[3:40:08] <LiquidMathew> Rhino is apparently just Juggernaut in different armor

[3:46:03] <+Quarkee> because rhino isnt the smartest
[3:46:06] <%AncelDeLambert> This is the song, for running from rhinos, as Miles tries to save the antibiotics

[3:46:21] <+imextremelymanly> Run
[3:46:21] <%ToxInjection> cause Rhino is a big dumby but he's great
[3:46:22] <Mr_Strut> I don't remember him being russian
[3:46:23] <xddddsorandom> WHY IS HE SO ATTRACTED TO LIGHTS
[3:46:25] <element_of_loyalty> Its in the script
[3:46:26] <%rdark_ksu> Rhino has to look around to have 2 brain cells to rub together to keep himself warm at night
[3:46:29] <+Reevesypoo> Rhino is the Paige of the Sinister Six
[3:46:31] <zamzoph> that was close monkaS
[3:46:31] <+FrostMass22> He didn't hear Miles so he didn't see him
[3:46:37] <%DedlokPM> Yeah it kinda sounded like he said "there" instead of where.
[3:46:37] <kaindoog> THE CRATES
[3:46:47] <coreybom> @angiestpat it seems the primary reasons mostly because they dont wanna accept another person taking place over their power fantasy of spider-man, with miles being a black/Puerto rican nerd, instead of a white nerd. Hes a good and well written character, one thats often consider one of the best in recent memory. If he wasn't, then why would not only be transplated to the main marvel universe from the ultimate, his own film, be a constant side character on two recent Spider-Man cartoons, and be a major part

[4:09:14] <supersparta333> Wine celler
[4:09:15] <+Wurmspawn> So in this continuity MJ know's who Spider man is and Norman has become Mayor before becoming the Green Goblin or even gaining any super powers/evil personality problems.
[4:09:15] <Zaphire_Saucypants> weiiiird
[4:09:16] <+Gorgen> OR IS IT
[4:09:16] <$RaikenTB> that happens a lot in this game.
[4:09:17] <dewyweb> most of the reflections are like that
[4:09:18] <Innocuous_Goat> Don't worry about it
[4:09:18] <turf_wind_and_fire> Ok! Ok! @AngriestPat the code is "1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . 4 . . . 5 . . . 6." It's the same as my luggage.
[4:09:20] <XHeavyfireX> @NWR_James Read the comic about what happened before the events of this game. He made "Blood Spider".
[4:09:21] <HoIlywood_SN> i have an unpopular opinion in that i think the 2002 Spider-Man movies Green Goblin costume was actually a fantastic design
[4:09:22] <%Agami23> MJ is a vampire??
[4:09:24] <+Gorgen> MAYBE YOUR EYES ARE WRONG
[4:09:25] <element_of_loyalty> BREAK THE GLASS
[4:09:26] <+HellCopter> Remember Payday 2, people trying to the "The Secret" and being infuriated that none of the reflections were right

[4:09:59] <Zaphire_Saucypants> he's the fuckin Mayor
[4:10:00] <$RaikenTB> I wouldn't know what to do with half this space.

[4:10:17] <$magikestral> @angriestpat a "fun" problem that happened there made the wrong reflection look like the twin towers were projected on the freedom tower. Same kind of glitch
[4:10:18] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @HellCopter I've kept up with PAYDAY 2 ever since the armored transport heists and I never understood what exactly was "The Secret".....

[4:31:58] <laguerrilha> The textures are great
[4:31:59] <+imextremelymanly> There it is

[4:32:04] <supersparta333> He looks like one of your space dolls
[4:32:06] <mercado94> i bet that spider is going to come off of her clothes and bit miles

[4:32:27] <+korth367> @AngriestPat you can totally beat this shit tonight
[4:32:27] <bruno_silv0> in the comics are Miles¬¥s spider powers the same as Peter¬¥s or are they different?
[4:32:28] <Hawkbone_> The game itself talks about how Sable is incompetent.
[4:32:28] <%ToxInjection> but hero angst tho
[4:32:30] <mercado94> spider aunt
[4:32:30] <+tigerfang86> they SUPER DID though
[4:32:31] <%AncelDeLambert> Put WHAT right, Peter? None of this has anything to do with you at all.
[4:32:31] <King_catharsis> Spider: "well shit, now I'm invested."
[4:32:32] <AlasterAngelo> remember when Li bombed times square
[4:32:33] <$magikestral> @angriestpat you're two missions away, so have fun beating the game tonight

[4:32:43] <LiquidMathew> Can you imagine if Miles was a fake out and MJ got powers
[4:32:45] <laguerrilha> Li killed a LOT of civilians and Otto poisoned the city
[4:32:48] <tyrano_the_wise> Yuri is best girl
[4:32:49] <%altairibnlaahad909> @bruno_silv0 same powers but also has weird electric stingers plus invisibility
[4:32:49] <iwa5h4ck3d> @MonsieurHedge She just hits Jiren with a stun gun
[4:32:50] <%AncelDeLambert> The disease isn't your fault, Li attacking the city isn't your fault, jesus christ
[4:32:50] <moonslair> snibers
[4:32:52] <CrypticMochi> So now she‚Äôll have powers to justify her insane bullshit?
[4:32:58] <+fFailureatlife> but hes spiderman
[4:32:59] <+QuadraticGravity> @AngriestPat You can finish this like tonight if you go another hour and a half or so. Just so you're aware.
[4:33:02] <%xemnahort> anyone else bothered by how ridiculously big that spider is
[4:33:05] <+fFailureatlife> and he has responsibility

[4:33:28] <%ssjklyco> Not yet
[4:33:28] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @AngriestPat Don't expect it to turn out that way...
[4:33:29] <sileo_patronus> @xemnahort spiders are large though
[4:33:30] <%ToxInjection> I mean, this superhero self-guilt hero complex shit is super common
[4:33:31] <Zaphire_Saucypants> like like two missions
[4:33:31] <gyrogogozeppeli> JJJ IS BACK
[4:33:31] <$MightyMaxT> What is it, 2? 3 missions left?
[4:33:32] <+ukokira> Funny joke
[4:33:33] <%xemnahort> 2 missions left pat
[4:33:34] <bruno_silv0> damn Peter got the short end of the stick; MIles is just better
[4:33:34] <Clu_Flynn> Seriously fucc Miles give us Spider MJ
[4:33:35] <+Grayhammatter> canon PogChamp
[4:33:36] <dero45> Now the story revs into final gears
[4:33:37] <AlasterAngelo> still blows my mind they used fucking Mr. Negative as one of the main antagonists
[4:33:41] <%ToxInjection> Superheroes are always gonna blame themselves for shit happening
[4:33:43] <MonsieurHedge> give us spider-may.
[4:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> No, it's pretty accurate, JJJ
[4:33:48] <+fFailureatlife> mr negative is awesome
[4:33:50] <prettypatties97> Oh JJJ, never change
[4:33:51] <moonslair> literally
[4:33:52] <element_of_loyalty> COLUMBUS SQUARE
[4:33:57] <dero45> OG suit would be better than this Nike suit
[4:33:59] <+SilasDrekken> @angriestpat you‚Äôll get a point of no return warning for the end
[4:33:59] <moonmeh> ????
[4:34:01] <baronvonkame> Cant wait for Jameson to get kicked off the radio for calling devils breath incident a false flag
[4:34:03] <tungstenviper> J JONAH JONES
[4:34:04] <gyrogogozeppeli> Jesus Christ, JJJ
[4:34:04] <ricksaintriot> CHEMICALS IN THE WATER
[4:34:05] <+tigerfang86> JJJ please
[4:34:08] <%xemnahort> @sileo_patronus black widows are an inch at most

[4:34:18] <%altairibnlaahad909> AND SPIDER-MAN IS TURNING THE FROGS GAY
[4:34:20] <laguerrilha> @ToxInjection that is stupid and i have it, but the contrary of its never their fault is worst
[4:34:20] <Habblewater> TURNIN THE FRICKIN SPIDERS MEN

[4:34:23] <Hawkbone_> He's not right at all
[4:34:23] <%mister___doctor> At this point I got really sick of JJJ
[4:34:23] <aeonicvector> Yeaj

[4:34:33] <%whoinvitedzach> apatWrong
[4:34:33] <zakti_prime> ha
[4:34:34] <Zaphire_Saucypants> the rightest/wrongest
[4:34:34] <%xemnahort> @Clu_Flynn why not both
[4:34:35] <Mr_Strut> JJ did nothing wrong
[4:34:36] <+baseball7000> HE'S ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT
[4:34:39] <moonslair> oben it
[4:34:39] <Mastigias> No cjoice
[4:34:40] <thisisacoolguy> Why does he keep sucking his men
[4:34:41] <$Piemono> It's mind control man
[4:34:41] <King_catharsis> In the words of the dude, "You're not wrong, you're just an asshole"
[4:34:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> he makes you
[4:34:42] <laguerrilha> Mind control
[4:34:42] <%DedlokPM> MIND CONTROL
[4:34:43] <Hawkbone_> because they don't
[4:34:43] <$BoSteed> Because he already did it to them
[4:34:43] <+Meekest> Mind control
[4:34:44] <SatansDick1> mind control
[4:34:44] <+DoggyT> WHat you need is some Feel Good Ooze right now.\
[4:34:44] <LiquidMathew> Because he can gift you nega-powers too
[4:34:46] <%AncelDeLambert> NANOMACHINES
[4:34:46] <Tisaric> >having a choice
[4:34:46] <+imextremelymanly> I think they are being mind controlled
[4:34:47] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @AngriestPat He's got mind control powers
[4:34:49] <%altairibnlaahad909> JJJ is simultaneously both incredibly wrong and incredibly right
[4:34:49] <illTemperedSeaBass> There's a consistent ring of truth to everything JJJ says. Sometimes he's more right than others, though.
[4:34:49] <MasterDecoder> Fear
[4:34:49] <iwa5h4ck3d> Cool demon wepons
[4:34:50] <A_Zealous_Retort> mind control
[4:34:50] <Zaphire_Saucypants> loyalty, mang
[4:34:50] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> because he has mind control powers @AngriestPat
[4:34:50] <tyrano_the_wise> LOL
[4:34:51] <crimsonharvest> hits em wtih teh sha from wow
[4:34:53] <+DoggyT> You're IN New Yorkl, should be Plenty.
[4:34:54] <aeonicvector> Cause he forces you with a biocurse
[4:34:55] <zal_silverfang> so, how did a "cure" do THIS to LI?
[4:34:55] <Zaphire_Saucypants> It's an ELEMENT
[4:34:59] <sleepycorpse> They are corrupted
[4:35:01] <thisisacoolguy> They aren't mind controlled, they don't have glowy bodies
[4:35:01] <laguerrilha> He Norts people
[4:35:03] <%Cynful_Pleasures> It's implied the Demons are basically cult members
[4:35:04] <ricksaintriot> charismatic villains are underrated
[4:35:04] <CatmanIX> he knew doc ock they'd all break out of prison and release the devil's breath?
[4:35:05] <%DedlokPM> When he does that he is taking back the power and mind control he put into them
[4:35:05] <+Quarkee> you dont work for lee he eats your brain
[4:35:08] <moonslair> semen demons
[4:35:08] <%ToxInjection> @laguerrilha it's dumb at times, but it at least makes sense and can tug at heartstrings wen done right. The opposite just makes them look insensitive and self-righteous.
[4:35:08] <LiquidMathew> JJJ is right for the wrong reasons
[4:35:08] <Hidashi13> NORTED
[4:35:11] <zal_silverfang> like, literaly straight up magic bullshit
[4:35:13] <Mr_Strut> Even if he didn't, are you gonna say NO to a guy that does that shit?
[4:35:14] <element_of_loyalty> KO kill off
[4:35:15] <+oleron_666> big norted
[4:35:19] <%Cynful_Pleasures> They think Li's powers are divine or some shit
[4:35:20] <mercado94> Look at all those Xehanorts
[4:35:21] <ricksaintriot> need more villains that treat their underlings really well.
[4:35:22] <%mister___doctor> I wonder who mind controls Pat into streaming
[4:35:22] <dero45> When he does that it feels like bustin 59 nuts
[4:35:24] <+fFailureatlife> nice
[4:35:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[4:35:26] <%MisterCrimson> Also, it's explained earlier, but he ships in Chinese criminals and that's how they pay him back
[4:35:31] <+imextremelymanly> Brute stealth
[4:35:32] <Hidashi13> is this kingdom hearts 4?
[4:35:34] <%ToxInjection> S T E A L T H
[4:35:38] <Clu_Flynn> Both?? Like... 3 people with Spider powers? i'm super fine with that
[4:35:44] <Habblewater> MUST BE THE SPIDER
[4:35:45] <zal_silverfang> guys, pat hates kingdom hearts. he doesnt understand what "norted" means
[4:35:49] <gyrogogozeppeli> Time for Tsundere Sable
[4:35:53] <+Meekest> That dude just stood there and took it
[4:35:54] <MonsieurHedge> i want SPIDER OSBORN.
[4:35:54] <SunnyD_Solaire> Brute stealth
[4:35:56] <crimsonharvest> I Feel like there's no height from which a divekick that would knock you out would not also kill you
[4:35:56] <%AncelDeLambert> JJ tells the truth like a punch to the face is physical contact. Yeah, sure, alright, but I think we're missing some crucial context
[4:35:59] <laguerrilha> your men are dead
[4:36:02] <Zalthia> Nah, it hasn‚Äôt been long enough for it to be kh4. Give it like 4 more spin off games
[4:36:05] <jack_s1n> Much like riku they are one with the darkness
[4:36:07] <extradopeness> I missed The Distillers during the credits on this game
[4:36:07] <iwa5h4ck3d> Your men couldnt handle MJ
[4:36:07] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Godammit, Sable
[4:36:09] <prettypatties97> Sable, you are bad at your fucking job
[4:36:09] <%MisterCrimson> why is Silver Sable such a dumb cunt in this?
[4:36:11] <%rdark_ksu> Superheroes could be actually nefarious so fast if you just consider a few things. Like the "acting on their own" isnt true and there is a illuminati level of the gov that tells them what to do. Could go dark real fast
[4:36:19] <+imextremelymanly> not just yet
[4:36:22] <%mister___doctor> You could put almost anything after "Pat hates" and I would believe it
[4:36:23] <Hawkbone_> @zal_silverfang the same way it was so incredibly infectious and deadly that it caused a complete quarantine of New York
[4:36:25] <gyrogogozeppeli> You guys just suck
[4:36:26] <LiquidMathew> Trip Mine
[4:36:30] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[4:36:31] <tyrano_the_wise> geez this guys
[4:36:39] <MonsieurHedge> Pat will devour all of reality, in time
[4:36:39] <deersuplexer> LOOK AT THESE JOBBERS
[4:36:40] <Bouldus> "this ends now" *holding nose*
[4:36:41] <ricksaintriot> Pat Hates Pictures... Pictures of Spider-Man
[4:36:45] <%SaltyDongs> there are bad dudes with mask all over
[4:36:51] <dero45> Paralyze them all
[4:36:51] <JDebss> How is Silver Sable so fucking stupid?
[4:36:55] <crimsonharvest> Pictures of pictures of spiderman
[4:36:59] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat sooo are these guy compedent storm troopers
[4:37:01] <%AncelDeLambert> So what are Li's powers? Are they in fact nanomachines, son?
[4:37:01] <+Quarkee> @rdark_ksu in marvel ca on some heroes including iron man ar LITERALLY in the illuminati
[4:37:06] <zal_silverfang> @Hawkbone_ that, doesnt really explain the MAGIC part of it. unless you are saying that in the sense of "comic books, fuck it"
[4:37:09] <HoIlywood_SN> @rdark_ksu theres literally a group in Marvel called the Illuminati who make world changing decisions, run by Tony Stark, Charles Xavier, Black Bolt, Doctor Strange, Namor, and i think Reed Richards
[4:37:09] <Clu_Flynn> Sable needs to be respected with a punch across her beautiful face
[4:37:10] <bambowl> jetpack attack
[4:37:11] <tyrano_the_wise> "competent"
[4:37:12] <%mister___doctor> Pat Hates easy mode
[4:37:20] <ricksaintriot> I want pictures of things that look like they could be of Spider-Man, if you squint and hold it to a mirror.
[4:37:22] <gyrogogozeppeli> Why did they give idiots jetpacks?
[4:37:23] <Brutal_Defeat> pat hates crack
[4:37:26] <Zaphire_Saucypants> man I love this music
[4:37:27] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @rosemon5001 They're high tech versions of the TYGER mercs from Arkham City
[4:37:38] <laguerrilha> Woolie would sell the city for the jetpack
[4:37:39] <rosemon5001> ahh cool
[4:37:40] <EMP_Ike_Turner> reed was definitely Illuminati. that asshole.
[4:37:41] <ricksaintriot> MISSED OPPORTUNITY
[4:37:45] <%rdark_ksu> @HoIlywood_SN Yea I'm not a big fan of them. Espically since they are mostly egotistical fuckwads
[4:37:46] <%ToxInjection> Mercenary MILF Kreygasm
[4:37:46] <Estuko> @crimsonharvest speaking of pictures, I am trying a photo mode where I take photos of spider-man mid action or combat from an angle where I'd be just a human photographer
[4:37:48] <ricksaintriot> to say she was DI-SABLE-D
[4:37:48] <bruno_silv0> has there been a nod in the game as to what anyone of the avengers are doing?
[4:37:49] <JDebss> FUCK OFF
[4:37:50] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> AH FUCK
[4:37:53] <Hawkbone_> People on the in-game fake-twitter talk about how Sable is incompetent and doesn't actually do anything, so it was completely intentional.
[4:37:56] <MonsieurHedge> sable is kind of evil tbh
[4:37:57] <baronvonkame> she's a fucking lunatic
[4:37:57] <tyrano_the_wise> She is so stupid
[4:37:58] <%mister___doctor> Pat Hates Silver Sable
[4:37:59] <Estuko> FUCK OFF SABLE
[4:37:59] <Clu_Flynn> Beeatch
[4:38:02] <%AncelDeLambert> this is dumb, moreso than usual
[4:38:02] <prettypatties97> Time to kill her, just like Uncle Ben would have wanted
[4:38:03] <Lilgamba> Now Fuck!
[4:38:04] <JDebss> stupid bimbo
[4:38:05] <EMP_Ike_Turner> because you couldnt
[4:38:05] <+BlackMage66652> A russian waifu appears

[4:38:31] <+NWR_James> Man I hate the KLOBBs
[4:38:31] <gyrogogozeppeli> TSUN TSUN
[4:38:32] <$RaikenTB> Someone please rip this model Kreygasm

[4:38:40] <MonsieurHedge> WEB HER AS SOON AS SHE TURNS HER BACK

[4:39:48] <%mister___doctor> I dont get it, what reason is there for you fucks to hate silver sable. Shes the best part of that organization
[4:39:49] <prettypatties97> They play her up like she's competent, and that makes her organization competent, except they don't actually show her do anything of real significance so they all look bad at their job
[4:39:50] <ricksaintriot> with an attitude like that
[4:39:51] <%cerass> 1

[4:40:21] <Hawkbone_> @prettypatties97 They super don't, if you read the in-game twitter everyone talks about how Sable sucks at their jobs
[4:40:22] <%AncelDeLambert> War makes money, Jack!
[4:40:22] <+tigerfang86> COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY
[4:40:24] <%ToxInjection> god this lighting
[4:40:28] <bambowl> but harvard wouldnt let me in SPIDERMAN
[4:40:31] <+NWR_James> god Spiderman really does know everyone in this universe huh

[4:40:45] <mattconwaytadds> when did stream start?
[4:40:47] <%xemnahort> COMES GREAT PUNISHMENT
[4:40:48] <gyrogogozeppeli> Hes so negative
[4:40:50] <litcrow> since norman's going to turn into the goblin li is super right
[4:40:51] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> P A R E N T S
[4:40:51] <dalishprince> !uptime
[4:40:51] <JohnAtDawn> cheer200 So Pat I remember when you said that if you found out someone you loved was a psycho you would narc them out because you would feel like the entire relationship is a lie. Martin Li fits this to a fucking T.
[4:40:51] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 40m 53s.
[4:40:53] <HoIlywood_SN> im pretty sure even in the comics Silver Sable is the only person in her company and the Wild Pack who is even remotely approaching competent
[4:40:55] <$BoSteed> *Boop*
[4:40:57] <crimsonharvest> its litearlly the sha
[4:40:57] <+Quarkee> the best part is that marti is a million percent justified
[4:40:58] <%AncelDeLambert> This is some Star Wars Force bs, I'm so lost
[4:40:59] <bambowl> poke

[4:41:26] <+imextremelymanly> Put it on your hands
[4:41:27] <Hawkbone_> @Quarkee His motives are justified, but his actions super aren't
[4:41:27] <+Gorgen> negative hurting juice
[4:41:28] <prettypatties97> @Hawkbone_ You know what, fair enough, if they actually acknowledge that Sable are in fact shit at their jobs, then probs to the game devs for being smart about it
[4:41:28] <%MagickBurritoh> why
[4:41:36] <Hidashi13> man literally too angry to die
[4:41:40] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> OH JESUS
[4:41:42] <EMP_Ike_Turner> darkmoon
[4:41:42] <prettypatties97> @Hawkbone_ *props, not probs

[4:41:45] <%AncelDeLambert> ow
[4:41:47] <$Niney_Who> aaaaaa
[4:41:49] <AlasterAngelo> he probably deserved that
[4:41:49] <ape_hawk> i mean, martin's right
[4:41:49] <crimsonharvest> damnit i wanted him dead
[4:41:53] <Bouldus> owie
[4:41:55] <%MagickBurritoh> yes
[4:41:56] <tyrano_the_wise> wat
[4:41:57] <+Wurmspawn> Moments later
[4:41:58] <A_Zealous_Retort> literally moments
[4:41:58] <%SaltyDongs> seconds even
[4:41:58] <TheMilhouseExperience> Drink it. Drink it.
[4:41:59] <Innocuous_Goat> Fuck
[4:41:59] <+korth367> more like few seconds
[4:42:00] <+HellCopter> It's a dumb transition
[4:42:00] <Zaphire_Saucypants> quick moments
[4:42:01] <XHeavyfireX> Yes
[4:42:01] <laguerrilha> 10 seconds earlier
[4:42:03] <bearwagon> litetally moments
[4:42:04] <ape_hawk> norman was just using martin as a test subject
[4:42:06] <%deadpalvgz> ...
[4:42:07] <%AncelDeLambert> BECAUSE HE'S SPIDERMAN, DORK
[4:42:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> SKOOM
[4:42:10] <%ToxInjection> literally a few moments
[4:42:10] <SatansDick1> literlly a moment
[4:42:11] <$Niney_Who> NAH
[4:42:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> A few secs earlier. The scream before the cut was Norman.
[4:42:13] <laguerrilha> now its the present
[4:42:14] <%deadpalvgz> martin already killed HUNDREDS
[4:42:14] <deersuplexer> yea
[4:42:14] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah that moments earlier thing was really fucking weird. I guess they had two unrelated scenes and ran out of time or something
[4:42:15] <%Spydurman> bad transistion
[4:42:18] <+imextremelymanly> dont worry about it
[4:42:18] <dero45> This was weird
[4:42:18] <CrypticMochi> If he only went after Osborn, I wouldn‚Äôt care
[4:42:19] <%deadpalvgz> he's a bit past the point of "saving"
[4:42:19] <tyrano_the_wise> unnecesary even
[4:42:20] <XHeavyfireX> Spider-man woke to Norman's scream remember?
[4:42:20] <Them00n> 1
[4:42:25] <ricksaintriot> Negaman
[4:42:30] <+imextremelymanly> time to fight
[4:42:31] <crimsonharvest> no it isn't, watch the wow pandaria cutscenes it must be taken from the same myth
[4:42:31] <sosuke5> ANIME
[4:42:31] <bambowl> ANIME
[4:42:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Li has murdered enough people that no possible motive justifies it
[4:42:34] <iwa5h4ck3d> story gets weird at times
[4:42:36] <AlasterAngelo> Negaman is a much better name that Mr Negative
[4:42:37] <LiquidMathew> I think its trying to say that while Spiderman was seeing the photo, Osborn was getting stabbed
[4:42:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> FOLDED 100000 TIMES
[4:42:40] <+tigerfang86> TOP 10 ANIME BATTLES
[4:42:41] <Hawkbone_> It probably means the literal time increment of a "moment" which is pretty short
[4:42:46] <supersparta333> They could have just said "Elsewhere"
[4:42:47] <%xemnahort> moments are a non specific length of time
[4:42:51] <EMP_Ike_Turner> he flash stepping
[4:42:51] <cherubsanonymous> Where'd his vocal effect go
[4:42:53] <moonslair> misuK misuK misuK misuK
[4:42:54] <$RaikenTB> Would that make Spiderman an SJW? Kappa
[4:42:58] <%ToxInjection> It really isn't that confusing
[4:42:59] <Klarrann3> @AngriestPat In case no one mentioned it, the game forces you to use the white suit for the final mission
[4:42:59] <%MagickBurritoh> Whoah
[4:42:59] <iwa5h4ck3d> PARRY GOD
[4:43:00] <tyrano_the_wise> get fucked
[4:43:01] <$Niney_Who> HOLY SHIT
[4:43:02] <+ThatRandomGuy661> You infected the city with a literal cancer though
[4:43:03] <TheCrou> could try the quad damage powerup
[4:43:03] <Zaphire_Saucypants> nice
[4:43:06] <ricksaintriot> yeah, but it sounds like a racial slur
[4:43:07] <laguerrilha> NICE
[4:43:07] <bruno_silv0> you killed my parents so ill kill thousands for justice
[4:43:08] <Saltmeisterr> PogChamp
[4:43:08] <gyrogogozeppeli> SUPER ANIME
[4:43:08] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> OH THAT'S COOL

[4:43:12] <moonslair> he gonna chop suey ur spider ass
[4:43:15] <%MagickBurritoh> FIGHT THE DARK HADOU
[4:43:15] <+Mekhet09> The marvel justice system is shitty though.
[4:43:18] <+Quarkee> he has the power of pain AND anime on his side
[4:43:18] <Animeshowfan> just yanked him like a tou
[4:43:19] <$Niney_Who> Also this music is really good
[4:43:20] <CrypticMochi> True justice seems to be jail them til they escape
[4:43:22] <dero45> Hit em with all the things
[4:43:22] <ricksaintriot> also Darkwing Duck did it (first?)
[4:43:23] <+Mekhet09> Mass murders get out all the time.
[4:43:23] <alexandrecau> @gyrogogozeppeli -100000 time it's negatively folded
[4:43:28] <SunnyD_Solaire> He looks better normally
[4:43:32] <%AncelDeLambert> Yeah, I don't think hugging it out is gonna fix this, Peter
[4:43:35] <zal_silverfang> peter has a point. killing him like this makes him a martyr. none of his shit witll get out cause the company execs will try and save face
[4:43:35] <+imextremelymanly> just like the subway pat
[4:43:39] <AlasterAngelo> the white suit is baller

[4:44:36] <+Wurmspawn> The unfortunate thing about a hero telling a villain that they met while the villain was acting like being a normal person, "This isn't you!" is that the hero never knew the real person.

[4:47:30] <MonsieurHedge> alright, poll time: is this MAGIC or PSYCHIC? i think that, given his origins, these are his mutant powers
[4:47:33] <bambowl> this is so dumb i love it
[4:47:34] <+BlackMage66652> Use your gadgets goddammit
[4:47:34] <zal_silverfang> so, for real though. could this energy of his be harnessed into like clean energy? become a literal walking power plant with some wireless connection taking his run off?
[4:47:40] <tyrano_the_wise> i wish the game had more boss fights
[4:47:40] <Hawkbone_> I think we need to pull out the web blossom

[4:47:46] <AlasterAngelo> @zal_silverfang no but it can cure cancer
[4:47:49] <A_Zealous_Retort> I feel like this right here is web blossom porn
[4:47:50] <$Niney_Who> Maybe if you actually used a useful ability
[4:47:51] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @AngriestPat Try using gadgets for crowd control
[4:48:04] <%GarbageNirvana> Try being Spider-Man
[4:48:06] <zal_silverfang> @AlasterAngelo oh yeah, sure. cure cancer by use of FUCKING STAND ARROW
[4:48:07] <zakti_prime> use your tech
[4:48:08] <MonsieurHedge> @zal_silverfang running your city on Evil Power is how you get pretty much every lost civilization in a JRPG ever
[4:48:12] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @GarbageNirvana That also works.
[4:48:15] <HoIlywood_SN> im pretty sure Mister Negative literally just functions off of magic, its not some bio cure thing or mutant powers, its just actual magic he has
[4:48:15] <Hawkbone_> Using a finisher on a OHKO jobber LuL
[4:48:21] <gyrogogozeppeli> Pat is getting owned hard LUL

[5:00:44] <%Agami23> why not crush his leg rather than drop him??
[5:00:46] <+fFailureatlife> THE MUSIC
[5:00:47] <gyrogogozeppeli> STILL EVIL
[5:00:48] <TheMilhouseExperience> Do you know how much I sacrificed?!
[5:00:51] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat well he wants closure. If you dont give it to him it will rot inside
[5:00:51] <extradopeness> Exactly
[5:00:51] <LiquidMathew> the Chad Osborn vs the Virgin Ock
[5:00:52] <zal_silverfang> he was going to die either way. might aswell give a big middle finger to his ex friend
[5:00:52] <EMP_Ike_Turner> super run away
[5:00:56] <%ToxInjection> apatBig SETPIECES
[5:00:59] <HoIlywood_SN> sly wink saucy smile

[5:01:02] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Osborn: I love you Spider-Man
[5:01:02] <dero45> So is Otto gonna just be a limp puppet with robo tentacles when his disease takes over
[5:01:03] <extradopeness> I love that
[5:01:08] <EBT93> What a smug asshole
[5:01:08] <%AncelDeLambert> Octavius was so meticulous about everything else, but he didn't have a backup plan to expose Norman?
[5:01:11] <Justhere4kicks> Even to the end Norm.. nevermind.
[5:01:12] <%scorpion12590> smug ass grin
[5:01:12] <+Thorn14> thats the implication dero45

[5:01:20] <Zaphire_Saucypants> USE GADGETS
[5:01:22] <supersparta333> FAST
[5:01:23] <moonslair> misuRAGE misuRAGE misuRAGE
[5:01:25] <$BoSteed> He's fighting the man that literally unleashed a plague. LuL
[5:01:25] <+capnbeeb> GADGET TIME DUDE

[5:01:36] <%AncelDeLambert> yep, Oc is and will always be the coolest
[5:01:37] <%rdark_ksu> shock maybe?
[5:01:38] <LiquidMathew> New Super Power
[5:01:47] <A_Zealous_Retort> a swift application of GADGET might do the trick!
[5:01:48] <+imextremelymanly> so is your suit power
[5:01:48] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> JUST SPAM BULLSHIT
[5:01:49] <Meta_Four> "When Osborne pays for his crimes?" You just threw him off the roof and didn't see Spider-Man rescue him!\
[5:01:50] <extradopeness> LETS GOOOOOOO
[5:01:52] <bambowl> NO
[5:01:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> he has the arms but his body is still an old man. shouldn't one punch knock him out

[5:02:11] <ricksaintriot> yeah, theoretically
[5:02:11] <+Thorn14> Maybe the suits improves his adrenaline or something
[5:02:12] <+StrawberryBandit> already doing much better than the last guy I watched do this
[5:02:12] <Zaphire_Saucypants> cut off
[5:02:13] <Zaphire_Saucypants> hah
[5:02:14] <dero45> Unlimated Powaaaaaa
[5:02:17] <zamzoph> FLOOR IS LAVA
[5:02:18] <Ser_Randal> Otto wrestled in high school
[5:02:19] <LiquidMathew> @PlagueOfGripes He's definitely pulling his punches
[5:02:19] <+fFailureatlife> do you want this to be realistic or do you want this to be cool
[5:02:19] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Holy shit
[5:02:19] <ricksaintriot> it's not like he's a super-soldier.
[5:02:20] <%ToxInjection> DOESN'T MOVE LUL
[5:02:20] <crimsonharvest> wait is that a neural suit?????
[5:02:20] <HoIlywood_SN> @PlagueOfGripes the weird chip fried his brain
[5:02:23] <+tigerfang86> FIRE GROUND
[5:02:26] <moonslair> yeah why not just crush him when you had full control over him dumber umterpus
[5:02:26] <%AncelDeLambert> "Gotta move!" Pat stands there
[5:02:32] <bambowl> how
[5:02:34] <$Niney_Who> @StrawberryBandit You can say Jesse Cox it's okay
[5:02:36] <+Ell1ot> why is he surprised about his new suit? Pat changed suits ever other second
[5:02:39] <+Quarkee> GOTTA MOVE
[5:02:40] <+Thorn14> Pat just standing in the fire
[5:02:44] <laguerrilha> Pat is doing A LOT bette then many people who played this
[5:02:46] <EMP_Ike_Turner> Electro did that in Spider-Man vs The Kingpin on Genesis
[5:02:47] <%AncelDeLambert> he can do it, too
[5:02:48] <crimsonharvest> he MULTIPLIED his spider reflex by neuro suit
[5:02:50] <tyrano_the_wise> thats the same on spiderman 2 right? he takes hits like a champ
[5:02:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> Osborn is dead as far as you know
[5:02:51] <Zaphire_Saucypants> real good
[5:02:52] <$Niney_Who> YOOO I NEVER SAW THAT BEFORE
[5:02:54] <zal_silverfang> @Niney_Who wait what? what happened?
[5:02:55] <%ToxInjection> THAT'S RAD
[5:02:56] <baronvonkame> Local man holds cure for cancer hostage
[5:03:01] <$BoSteed> Isn't Osborn already in a world of hurt?
[5:03:04] <MonsieurHedge> yknow otto is really durable for a pudgy scientist with a neurological disorder
[5:03:04] <%bloodypurpledog> The entire rest of the game from here is so goddamn good
[5:03:05] <$Niney_Who> @zal_silverfang He just didn't fight Doc Ock very well
[5:03:07] <+Thorn14> Honestly this version of Osborn is at worst corrupt
[5:03:09] <+Thorn14> but he's not EVIL
[5:03:11] <+StrawberryBandit> what if he just wants love barcCry
[5:03:15] <%AncelDeLambert> silly Pat
[5:03:16] <Estuko> @PlagueOfGripes at the end spider-man will crawl down and kiss osborn upside down
[5:03:17] <ricksaintriot> maybe he figures Spiderman saved Osborn if he's already there
[5:03:17] <Animeshowfan> now would be a perfect time for a selfie
[5:03:18] <+Thorn14> Like, he's a shit, but he's not a super villain
[5:03:22] <AthenaAegis> Sinister Six Family Patriarch, Doctor Octopus Kappa
[5:03:27] <%DedlokPM> I DON'T WANT TO CURE DISEASE! I WANT TO DESTROY OSBORN! z8z3
[5:03:32] <JDebss> Even cooler the third time....
[5:03:36] <gyrogogozeppeli> Hes evil but not without reason
[5:03:37] <+fFailureatlife> EVERYTHING IS LIES
[5:03:39] <LuckyLagomorph> BIG LIES
[5:03:41] <@PlagueOfGripes> what a ham
[5:03:43] <dero45> @thorn14 his brain gets messed up in the first scene but nothing is done
[5:03:45] <+StrawberryBandit> Is Octos suit armored in any way? Why isn't his bones broken by Spider-Man stomping on him
[5:03:59] <+fFailureatlife> because its cool
[5:04:00] <+Tokanova> what happensi f you just yeet outta there lmao
[5:04:01] <+imextremelymanly> time for big swings
[5:04:04] <HoIlywood_SN> @Thorn14 this is like how everyone SHOULD be reacting to normal Norman Osborn, but this Osborn is actually a lot more of a decent person than most, not as much as the Raimi one initially was, but not like the "heh im gonna fuck this teenager to really piss off spider-man"
[5:04:05] <%DedlokPM> @StrawberryBandit video games
[5:04:05] <moonmeh> pat is really good at this fight
[5:04:06] <+fFailureatlife> stop nitpicking comic fights
[5:04:06] <zoopbooploop> ere we gooooo
[5:04:06] <Zaphire_Saucypants> HERE WE GO
[5:04:07] <ricksaintriot> well, Osborn isn't supposed to be a villain until the thing happens
[5:04:09] <extradopeness> Pete does pull his punches and he cares a lot about Otto still
[5:04:11] <Zaphire_Saucypants> FAVORITE PART!
[5:04:12] <%AncelDeLambert> His suit HAS to be reinforced in some way, if for no other reason than to support those arms
[5:04:12] <+StrawberryBandit> @DedlokPM right OpieOP
[5:04:14] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> Oh fuck

[5:06:31] <%MagickBurritoh> CRUSH HIS HEAD PETER
[5:06:31] <zal_silverfang> @AncelDeLambert dude, he thought Otto was a good man all along deep down. that it was the arms. and slowly over the game he learns he wasnt for so long. to the point he knew about peter and would willingly kill him, someone he saw as a science partner, just for a petty grudge. anyone would be PISSED

[5:18:20] <mister_z_1994> And quite frankly you need a palette cleanser after that bombshell of an ending
[5:18:21] <%deadpalvgz> do it for us.
[5:18:24] <TheCrou> this is my personal GOTY
[5:18:25] <+Tjman112> dangLeft lionSleep1 dangM dangM dangM lionSleep2

[5:18:31] <+StrawberryBandit> wraxuAww
[5:18:33] <+Quarkee> did you find the pizza song pat
[5:18:34] <pabloelenano2> @CurrySauseBandit guess who isback in black?
[5:18:34] <@PlagueOfGripes> so is it weird that Fisk was never seen or heard from again despite being totally right
[5:18:34] <Hawkbone_> Fucking hell, this game is so good
[5:18:35] <Zantetzuken> elmo's kinda big for a baby cat
[5:18:35] <AlasterAngelo> is Mr Positive dead
[5:18:38] <%Kage_96> @AngriestPat You can skip this
[5:18:40] <Zaphire_Saucypants> Btw, the Credits after this are SUUUUUPER long
[5:18:40] <tyrano_the_wise> MJ is a monster
[5:18:40] <+Ssaik> That's the best game this year surely?
[5:18:42] <thisisacoolguy> This visual effect is cool on spiderman and Li when he's negative, but humans look scary as fuck
[5:18:43] <+Thorn14> Elmo is Chonk
[5:18:43] <gyrogogozeppeli> i need some breathing space
[5:18:45] <vivecdidnothingwrong> BOO
[5:18:47] <%deacon1621> Yeah, seriously
[5:18:47] <%ToxInjection> What a good-ass game
[5:18:47] <mister_z_1994> @TheCrou And we're not even done yet. WE still got the DLV stories
[5:18:48] <JDebss> What a solid 9/10
[5:18:48] <jackktrue> I'm listening to Crazy My Beat, ikr?
[5:18:49] <extradopeness> The end is the most spider man shit ever
[5:18:50] <+Ssaik> Unless some good indies have it beat
[5:18:50] <crimsonharvest> that was a fuckin trip
[5:18:50] <%AncelDeLambert> I do find it a little odd that Myles will probably get a first crack at Green Goblin
[5:18:51] <ricksaintriot> it's all about Ursula anyway
[5:18:52] <+Tjman112> @PlagueOfGripes Shhhh!
[5:18:53] <%mister___doctor> Now beat the game on easy mode
[5:18:54] <+fFailureatlife> ITS SUPER GOOD
[5:18:55] <%DrFacilier> 10x better than Homecoming, suck it MCU
[5:18:56] <%cerass> after credit scenes @angriestpat
[5:18:57] <Anonymasque> Looks like Aunt May went to the farm Uncle Ben bought...
[5:18:57] <+Quarkee> fisk was the fucking hero
[5:18:57] <zakti_prime> pat caught the feels
[5:18:58] <+Bloodbourneidentity> MAN Spiderman almost never has a true happy ending
[5:18:58] <zal_silverfang> @AngriestPat YEAH CRY YOU COWARD
[5:19:01] <vivecdidnothingwrong> ALWAYS BOO THE OCTOPUS
[5:19:01] <LiquidMathew> I fucking love the Anti-Ock Suit
[5:19:03] <%Bane_Kaikyo> BIG FEELS
[5:19:04] <dalishprince> fisk was right
[5:19:04] <+StrawberryBandit> *sniffle*
[5:19:05] <moonmeh> fisk did nothing wrong
[5:19:05] <%ToxInjection> Aunt May hits you like a freight train
[5:19:06] <Ropcord> yeah wait what the fuck happened to fisk
[5:19:06] <%rdark_ksu> @AngriestPat do you think the next one will be 50/50 Miles Peter?
[5:19:08] <DXLelouch24> 2 end credit scenes
[5:19:09] <+DAIROCKETTO> @AngriestPat wait to the end of the credits
[5:19:10] <Hawkbone_> CRYING IS OKAY
[5:19:11] <DatMemeGril> Fisk forgotten
[5:19:11] <SailingSaturn> When Company's give a shit, have time and money. it works wonders cirTan
[5:19:13] <Maverick2736> Yo', that's right... Fisk just outright disappeared from the story after that first fight with him
[5:19:13] <@PlagueOfGripes> more to come
[5:19:14] <DayDayMaccin1> Haven't seen Pat cry In a while....
[5:19:15] <Tiewolf> WHen's Tell-tales Spiderman?
[5:19:17] <HoIlywood_SN> Fisk is in jail
[5:19:19] <%ToxInjection> and Yuri did a phenomenal job
[5:19:21] <zamzoph> this was all Spider-Man's fault for busting Wilson Fisk!
[5:19:22] <dero45> Best Spider-Man movie hands down
[5:19:23] <+StrawberryBandit> true
[5:19:23] <TheUltrahumanoid> This is the only game to ever make me cry. Definitely one of the best games I‚Äôve ever plated
[5:19:23] <%Agami23> but single player story driven games are dead, right?
[5:19:24] <Animeshowfan> the story is really great
[5:19:24] <%DedlokPM> @SailingSaturn teenSIP
[5:19:25] <halospaz117> Yeah the six coulda done more
[5:19:27] <+Pixelated_Cloud> better than any spiderman movie
[5:19:31] <shlaggori> they had sick boss fights tho
[5:19:31] <gyrogogozeppeli> Doc Ock was so good in this game
[5:19:31] <crimsonharvest> i havent cried this much since yesterday when i saw some shit in Dragon Quest 11
[5:19:35] <jack_s1n> Finish yakuza 5 on stream pat you coward
[5:19:35] <@thenefftw> It's almost like making something other than an origin story is better
[5:19:35] <moonmeh> we also got fucking tombstone in this game
[5:19:35] <DestroyerDJ8> doc's buildup is SO GOOD
[5:19:35] <deersuplexer> At least they got cool fights
[5:19:36] <%ToxInjection> not a lot of Sinister Six actually going on. Li and Otto definitely get the most fleshed out
[5:19:37] <Zaphire_Saucypants> their fights are good tho
[5:19:38] <LiquidMathew> Hopefully Bosses will be more of a thing in the sequel
[5:19:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> you didn't mention Shocker!
[5:19:38] <gyrogogozeppeli> This Ock is better than Alfred Molina
[5:19:39] <mister_z_1994> It's written by Dan Slott. What did you expact?
[5:19:39] <TheMilhouseExperience> Good game, but everything in the ending but the May scene is an awful cliche.
[5:19:40] <JDebss> attention was off balance
[5:19:41] <BrachyZoid> They were just lackies
[5:19:41] <ape_hawk> well, they kinda are C-tier villains
[5:19:42] <%AncelDeLambert> Doc got the buildup he deserved
[5:19:44] <3viltiki> that's what the DLC is for right?
[5:19:45] <%IMDRanged> Saving it for DLCs or Sequels
[5:19:45] <TheUltrahumanoid> Played*
[5:19:46] <HoIlywood_SN> TO BE FAIR, those 4 get attention in like EVERY Spider-Man game
[5:19:46] <zal_silverfang> thought it was just going to be LI to be honest
[5:19:46] <shlaggori> BETTER THAN BATMAN
[5:19:46] <thepardack> Aren't these credits like stupid fucking long?
[5:19:46] <+imextremelymanly> At least you still get some pretty good fights with them
[5:19:46] <Estuko> @moonmeh and fucking Task Master
[5:19:46] <Tisaric> Doc and Li are the better villians since they're connected to Peter as well
[5:19:47] <+luftraumm1> actual character arcs tho
[5:19:49] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> it's almost like there is gonna be another game
[5:19:50] <%ToxInjection> I forgot Shocker LUL
[5:19:51] <Ropcord> üëç
[5:19:52] <moonmeh> taskmaster too
[5:19:53] <$RaikenTB> This seems better than the last 3 Arkhams.
[5:19:54] <MonsieurHedge> they didnt Amazing Spider Man 2 it, so its great
[5:19:54] <tyrano_the_wise> FISK DID NOTHING WRONG
[5:19:55] <TheCrou> rhino/scorpion fight was my only gripe about the game, it was too gimmicky with little effort
[5:19:55] <+StrawberryBandit> did you get the cure from Mr. Freeze?
[5:19:55] <@PlagueOfGripes> well, Batman doesn't cry
[5:19:55] <King_catharsis> But then again, there's not much to do with the rest of the 6
[5:19:56] <%altairibnlaahad909> @AngriestPat oh the story is leagues beyond the arkham games
[5:19:56] <Animeshowfan> yeah thats true but if they got alot of attention the story would have been a mess I feel
[5:19:57] <Goldenwolf98> @PlagueOfGripes Thats cause he does literally nothing
[5:19:57] <HoIlywood_SN> Shocker is the best villain
[5:19:58] <%nitronLVIII> Li felt a little one note
[5:19:59] <Maverick2736> ALSO TOMBSTONE AND SHOCKER
[5:19:59] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @AngriestPat You're right, but at least we got DUAL fights...even though it got them out of the way faster...
[5:20:00] <moonmeh> its such a good fanservice game
[5:20:00] <SeventyForce> They need stuff for DLC after all
[5:20:00] <JDebss> Member Shocker?
[5:20:01] <$Niney_Who> @AngriestPat And the final boss wasn't shit, unlike Batman
[5:20:02] <Pyanny> A lot of comic writers worked on this apparently
[5:20:03] <Darmarock> Which is good I'd say, considering how silly they are compared to Otto and Li
[5:20:05] <+LtShuckle> City is the best batman game story, but yeah this is better
[5:20:05] <AlasterAngelo> Taskmaster is the best fight in the game
[5:20:06] <Tisaric> WE NEED MYSTERIO
[5:20:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> lol
[5:20:08] <SunnyD_Solaire> Music better too
[5:20:09] <gyrogogozeppeli> Mysterio biding his time LUL
[5:20:09] <$BoSteed> I want Mysterio SO BAD
[5:20:09] <+StrawberryBandit> Mysterio PogChamp
[5:20:10] <ricksaintriot> oh fuck i had a Disturbed song going on in the background
[5:20:12] <Hawkbone_> I don't know about that. I'd say this and Batman are on par tbh
[5:20:12] <%IMDRanged> Jim Sterling wants MYSTERIO
[5:20:13] <reonome> WAIT FOR IT
[5:20:14] <%Cynful_Pleasures> I hope so too
[5:20:14] <+Rishnix> This felt better than the movies.
[5:20:15] <+BaronEgo> I want Mysterio to be the main villain of the next game so bad
[5:20:15] <ricksaintriot> and i thought it was the credits theme
[5:20:15] <mister_z_1994> I want Lizard goddammit
[5:20:15] <%DrFacilier> i wanna see Kraven and Mysterio in the next one
[5:20:16] <%ToxInjection> I can dream for Kraven and Venom/Carnage
[5:20:17] <energywarning> mysterio.... bases
[5:20:17] <Mr_Strut> No one remembers Mysterio
[5:20:17] <%Kage_96> @AngriestPat Mysterio might be round 2 DLC
[5:20:18] <%xemnahort> we need a sequel
[5:20:18] <+imextremelymanly> We know he exist in this world already
[5:20:18] <@PlagueOfGripes> I guess Pat didn't get Taskmaster
[5:20:19] <%mister___doctor> Get back here SHOCKER!!!
[5:20:19] <crimsonharvest> i hope the DLC is conscious of whether or not May is dead
[5:20:19] <SailingSaturn> Mysterio Levels are always so cool cirGreed
[5:20:20] <HoIlywood_SN> Mysterio is the fucking greatest ever
[5:20:21] <%bloodypurpledog> It'll be mysterio challenges
[5:20:22] <$BoSteed> Doc Ock on Titan
[5:20:23] <Mutanthunter> Better than the movies too, in my opinion
[5:20:23] <AlasterAngelo> @Darmarock Li summons a literal shadow monster heartless
[5:20:23] <LiquidMathew> I can see Mysterio being like Riddler sidequest or something in the sequel
[5:20:23] <$NocturneNovember> I want the Superior Foes as a big side story in the sequel
[5:20:23] <extradopeness> Who wants to remember Shocker lol
[5:20:24] <+Quarkee> mysterio showed up for like 10 seconds guys
[5:20:26] <%mister___doctor> SHOCKEEEEEEER!
[5:20:27] <+QuadraticGravity> @PlagueOfGripes he did
[5:20:28] <%rdark_ksu> Spider man has alot to choose from so they may reach into the bag again
[5:20:28] <Tiewolf> Lol when the rest of the game is in a movie
[5:20:29] <+Bloodbourneidentity> You gettin the DLC Pat?.
[5:20:29] <zoopbooploop> I just wish Peter got through to Li, to invigorate his efforts to save Otto
[5:20:29] <thisisacoolguy> what if the final boss was hulk joker
[5:20:30] <iwa5h4ck3d> Titan Joker LUL
[5:20:31] <%Agami23> @AngriestPat how many bits to make you stream that shocker clip from the animated series to wrap this up?
[5:20:31] <DXLelouch24> DLC Pat still
[5:20:31] <JDebss> Buff Joker was best boss
[5:20:31] <%DedlokPM> @PlagueOfGripes Daredevil may cry though
[5:20:33] <%AncelDeLambert> How does the Clayface bossfight rank?
[5:20:36] <Rngiddion> Imagine if Doc Ock took hulk serum before that fight
[5:20:37] <Goldenwolf98> Why cant the Batman games have good final bosses
[5:20:39] <%topendbuzz> LUL
[5:20:40] <dero45> It‚Äôs Arkham city i want that Spider-Man spiderknight for the sequel
[5:20:41] <+StrawberryBandit> Shocker? Who? OpieOP
[5:20:41] <%Fenrirlives> He stomped Taskmaster's Balls
[5:20:42] <Hidashi13> mysterio is the best
[5:20:42] <$MLG_Bear_Simulator> Batman has dead parents Spider-Man has dead parents and dead uncle and aunt
[5:20:42] <gyrogogozeppeli> Mysterio should be the Martin Li of the next game and the Symbiotes be the Doc Ock
[5:20:42] <+luftraumm1> sand man
[5:20:43] <BrachyZoid> No one cares about Shocker
[5:20:43] <%Bane_Kaikyo> I feel like if the other vilians got more of a spotlight, it woulda slowed down the pacing a bit @AngriestPat
[5:20:43] <%ToxInjection> YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAH

[5:25:36] <BrachyZoid> Give it a sequel, Miles got his powers, so Peter's fate is sealed
[5:25:37] <zakti_prime> the naked one is for 100% complete
[5:25:37] <deersuplexer> FINAL SUIT PAT
[5:25:37] <Hawkbone_> After how much people hated comic Miles , there was no way they would kill Peter
[5:25:38] <+StrawberryBandit> but super powers, he's fine
[5:25:39] <%deacon1621> Well he's got to be a mentor for the next game right?

[5:38:28] <%Fenrirlives> DMC needs more lore exposition, I want to know more about the world
[5:38:42] <baronvonkame> ok but can we talk about the DMC3 city for a sec? did Dante HAPPEN to choose the city the temi-ni-gru was under or can you summon it wherever?
[5:38:46] <AlasterAngelo> i'd watch the anime for DMC lore but its depressing and slow
[5:38:47] <Zantetzuken> yawns go up, podcast go down
[5:38:50] <%GarbageNirvana> @rdark_ksu Hope they like needy neurotic westies

[5:39:03] <deersuplexer> DMC anime is okay. Pretty inoffensive.
[5:39:04] <flame_of_udun_> There‚Äôs a DMC anime??
[5:39:05] <Arek_1> No desert... that backdrop of the city is just low resolution during dawn/dusk.

[5:46:42] <prettypatties97> Ah fuck
[5:46:45] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer232 should mention that the EBF games are free, although there is some content in the later one locked behind buting the steam version ,(armour, and/or challenge dungeons, based on which game)
[5:46:46] <%Agami23> WHY ARE WE YELLING?
[5:46:46] <%ShiftyFish> I always end up buying attacks before Air Hike too, just because I get tired of sitting on red orbs.
[5:46:59] <%AncelDeLambert> ebf?
[5:47:01] <%ShiftyFish> I usually don't get most of the blue orbs until my 2nd playthrough.
[5:47:13] <PeteyMcPickle> did he finish the game already?
[5:47:16] <baronvonkame> @AngriestPat weight in on the Khan discourse?
[5:47:17] <Duskers> inb4 mysterio dies in spiderman 2
[5:47:28] <deersuplexer> @PeteyMcPickle yes
[5:47:29] <Arek_1> But Square Enix is still inconsistent on pronouncing Ifrit.
