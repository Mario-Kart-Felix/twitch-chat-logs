[0:38:13] <+VidulaSaix> There is no easy tips really. You just kinda have to jump in and just roll with it for a while till it clicks. The new user experience is super poor.
[0:38:15] <hero1151> NO CLIP
[0:38:15] <outis94> destiny sucked and warframe looked better
[0:38:18] <+WILLIWJ> was it Fortuna?
[0:38:24] <AncelDeLambert> I think you were just sick of Destiny, Pat
[0:38:31] <Ropcord> just focus on one thing at a time if you're trying to learn the game you are fucked if you try to get it all at once
[0:38:32] <bbqshapez> WATCH SOME VIDS ON YOUTUBE
[0:38:32] <circular7> THE 2ND DREAM
[0:38:33] <%redeq2> LIKE PAIGE
[0:38:39] <aeonicvector> also wiki dive, and aim for quests
[0:38:42] <dsauce999> @angriestpat noclip doc?
[0:38:43] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Wiki
[0:38:45] <Rngiddion> You were like "I dont understand anything you are saying about this. It reminds me of Monster Hunter"
[0:38:46] <bbqshapez> WIKI
[0:38:48] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> check the wiki
[0:38:49] <hero1151> THE NO CLIP DOCUMENTRY

[0:38:50] <Worldbrand> dont buy anything from the goddamn market until you know better
[0:38:51] <TheInkshow> Did it

[0:39:04] <bbqshapez> UMBRA
[0:39:06] <%sassyquatch963> he's not hard to farm anymore
[0:39:06] <%boarqueen> be like woolie and pick mag, the true hero of warframe
[0:39:09] <Ropcord> he says as he's about to start sacrifice
[0:39:10] <haisho> eh Excalibur Prime doens't really matter
[0:39:14] <%OceanGovernor> MAG OMEGALUL
[0:39:15] <AncelDeLambert> Umbra was very disappointing to me

[0:39:17] <+Sonik2324> whats your favorite frame ?
[0:39:17] <Biscuitsfordays> I also picked mag
[0:39:17] <+WILLIWJ> Warframe was around before Destiny 1 and didn't go to shit in a sequel
[0:39:18] <bbqshapez> JUST LIKE WOOLIE
[0:39:19] <zamzoph> I made my account a very long time ago and picked Mag NotLikeThis
[0:39:21] <+Eclipse_knight_> fuck excal, get mag
[0:39:22] <+Cosairen> thats not true anymore he's super easy to get now
[0:39:26] <%HRDSalami654> Ssh, don't mention Umbra. He hasn't done it yet.
[0:39:26] <+Pnutz_> Excalibur is easy to get now
[0:39:27] <+McSoliace> if you don't pick excalibur pick volt
[0:39:27] <+WhyIDie> it still takes a lil while to get umbra, he's right to say pick excal first
[0:39:27] <TheInkshow> Operator
[0:39:29] <+TheOpinionater> Not hard to get excal now

[0:46:37] <StrawberryPantsu> Can you Zero Shift in this game?

[0:46:38] <Ropcord> ALL USELESS
[0:46:38] <TheInkshow> U CANT
[0:46:38] <+AntithesisEK> you need more copies
[0:46:38] <Volkrotia> CONSEQUENCE
[0:46:38] <BinaryBetrayer> With duplicates
[0:46:38] <%Halowood> Combine dupes
[0:46:39] <flying_man_3> you smash em together
[0:46:39] <%Cynful_Pleasures> Get more of them
[0:46:39] <Ultimatefool> Need multiple of the same
[0:46:39] <%sassyquatch963> duplicates
[0:46:39] <+MarshallLee67> you get multiples to rank them up @AngriestPat
[0:46:39] <$Mendin> You shove more of the same Arcane into itself
[0:46:40] <bbqshapez> SLAP ARCANES TOGETHER
[0:46:40] <%Arxel1> Dupes
[0:46:41] <+Pnutz_> stack mulitiple
[0:46:41] <TheInkshow> Need more

[0:46:43] <aeonicvector> fuse clones
[0:46:43] <haisho> fuse copies together, meaning FARM MORE EIDOLONS
[0:46:44] <Volkrotia> Consequence is the best
[0:46:44] <%President_Miyazaki> You combine them into each other.
[0:46:46] <%mordred_t> You rank them up by combining duplicates.
[0:46:46] <cizal11> more arcanes is more strong
[0:46:47] <+AntithesisEK> 3 - 3 - 4
[0:46:47] <+Eclipse_knight_> naramon movespeed+ void dash = super saiyan
[0:46:47] <Caidezes> It says right on the screen, Pat.
[0:46:47] <bbqshapez> DUPLICATES

[0:47:09] <%HRDSalami654> They are all pretty bad.
[0:47:17] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> magnetic is good
[0:47:17] <%HRDSalami654> Just use them for the revives.
[0:47:19] <haisho> Consequence is actually SUPER GOOD for mobility if you don't have top tiers
[0:47:23] <$Mendin> Arcane Nullifier is Anti Eidolon damage
[0:47:23] <Volkrotia> They are better than nothing
[0:47:25] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> n u l l i f i e r

[0:47:29] <IminyourBase> the magnetic one is good for when you go eidolon hunting
[0:47:30] <superbla25> you have the lowest tier arcanes
[0:47:30] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> magnetic is the one that makes you lose all your energy
[0:47:32] <bbqshapez> NULLIFIER
[0:47:32] <aeonicvector> magnetic is good, and the great ones are later in
[0:47:36] <Ultimatefool> Buy 10x energize Kappa

[0:47:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> magnetic procs SUCK Pat
[0:47:37] <Volkrotia> Max rank Consequence makes u the fastest frame alive
[0:47:37] <NeoJoker316> need to start capturing eidolons, not killing rooKb
[0:47:38] <Ajaximus> The starter arcanes are better than nothing, you lose nothing equipping them
[0:47:40] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> better than nothing
[0:47:40] <flying_man_3> yup late game rewards are almost all kind of shit

[0:58:24] <+kralec> @siegejay if you mean in Warframe try to lvl up your damage based mods. Look for multi shot or pure element. Also, realise weapons are either Critical or Status based. They are never both.

[0:59:57] <+VidulaSaix> Asswing
[0:59:57] <%Superstarsage> Hey, you're not using the imperator, you're doing your retina's a favor as it is
[0:59:58] <zal_silverfang> probably just a tough up to some of the textures. but to agree with chat, gameplay wise, hellllllll no
[1:00:00] <bbqshapez> railjack is coming
[1:00:00] <%DoctorDakka> I wish archwing was better
[1:00:00] <AncelDeLambert> god, archwings are terrible
[1:00:01] <haisho> OH GOD THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN ARCHWING. UNDERWATER ARCHWING.
[1:00:02] <zal_silverfang> *touch
[1:00:03] <TropicalPsychosis> the sealab is cool guys shut up
[1:00:03] <%legendfather_of_giants> itzal is the best
[1:00:03] <AnalHaggar> inaros truly is the best boy
[1:00:04] <cizal11> make itzal
[1:00:05] <+Laecerelius> Sealab 2021. Bebop Cola good!
[1:00:05] <%BreakEternal> Amesha?
[1:00:06] <+DrWolpertinger> archwing is trash
[1:00:06] <%HRDSalami654> Itzal is awesome.
[1:00:06] <cizal11> or amesha
[1:00:06] <%rustyarmor> ARCH
[1:00:09] <%BreakEternal> Both are very, very good
[1:00:09] <bbqshapez> amesha
[1:00:09] <aeonicvector> Itzal is bae
[1:00:09] <%mordred_t> Elytron?
[1:00:10] <El_Samio> Itzal is the best arsewing, leave it for last
[1:00:12] <BlitzChocula> Itzal archwing BEST archwing.
[1:00:13] <alpharius88> sharkwing
[1:00:14] <laserbeaming> pronounced Arkwing. Amesha is the best one IMO
[1:00:14] <%HRDSalami654> So is Amesha.
[1:00:15] <flying_man_3> just make the explosioin one
[1:00:15] <+MarshallLee67> amesha is best for survivability
[1:00:15] <GPAlpha> Itzal is great
[1:00:15] <TropicalPsychosis> without sea lab we wouldn't have any tubes
[1:00:16] <AnalHaggar> and yes, itzal is pretty much my favorite dang archwing
[1:00:16] <Ropcord> ITZAL GO FAST
[1:00:16] <%Nirokahn> I still think archwings are nice, they make plains rivens easier
[1:00:17] <AncelDeLambert> I can't believe they actually vaulted the ONLY primed archwing
[1:00:17] <+Lordgale119> Itzal is LITERALLY GUNDAM PAT
[1:00:17] <%SplatterAte> archwings are the WORST
[1:00:17] <BinaryBetrayer> Elytron > Everything else
[1:00:18] <+Pnutz_> Elytron is so slow
[1:00:19] <%BreakEternal> You'll be well suited with either
[1:00:19] <haisho> Itzal and Amesha are godlike
[1:00:19] <flying_man_3> then never use it
[1:00:20] <cerberuscarmine> built itzal!
[1:00:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> NO
[1:00:21] <%BreakEternal> It's not
[1:00:22] <+CourageTheCat> no
[1:00:22] <+Lordgale119> ACTUAL FUNNELS
[1:00:22] <%mordred_t> No.
[1:00:22] <cizal11> it is not
[1:00:23] <Chichen> NO
[1:00:23] <GPAlpha> Nah
[1:00:23] <laserbeaming> Nope
[1:00:23] <%boarqueen> no
[1:00:23] <Worldbrand> It's only worth the mastery
[1:00:24] <%HRDSalami654> Those are the only two you will need.
[1:00:24] <Ultimatefool> Nope
[1:00:24] <+House_Of_Rage> no
[1:00:24] <KingOfTheGeats> NOPE
[1:00:25] <mcevers> Get ITzal
[1:00:25] <+dickbuttwoman> Itzal and Amesha and Odanata are great
[1:00:25] <+MarshallLee67> it's worth mastery rank but that's it
[1:00:25] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> NONE OF THEM ARE
[1:00:26] <+ginnyfield> Amesha is the best archwing
[1:00:26] <%BreakEternal> Just a minor stat bump
[1:00:26] <+Ryan1016> Like 60p maybe
[1:00:26] <bbqshapez> ODONATA PRIME 1 BOOST CRIT
[1:00:28] <$TheNeedlesD> Only worth MR
[1:00:29] <TheInkshow> no se
[1:00:31] <+AJ_Cherenkov> iztal or amesha
[1:00:31] <Shinmaddrox> it's only worth it's mastery.
[1:00:31] <%mordred_t> Odonata Prime is hot trash.
[1:00:32] <Fabric_tester> ha, no
[1:00:32] <+AntithesisEK> it was when Jordas was a thing but Amesha is comically powerful
[1:00:32] <%Superstarsage> only for the mr
[1:00:34] <+Lordgale119> Odonata Prime is good. Itzal is good
[1:00:34] <+Pnutz_> Itzal and Amesha are the best
[1:00:35] <zal_silverfang> just rank fodder
[1:00:35] <+skibbz_> I mean it's better than Odonata. but that's it
[1:00:36] <+Cosairen> odonata prime isnt even a good prime
[1:00:37] <bbqshapez> BOOST CRIT DESTROYS ARCHWING BOSS
[1:00:38] <+dickbuttwoman> Odanata is GREAT. It's 1 secretely increases crit
[1:00:38] <+AntithesisEK> absurd levels of strong
[1:00:40] <Ultimatefool> Itzal and Amesha are the better ones, Elytron has a nuke but EH
[1:00:41] <Ropcord> itzal is the only good one because it helps you farm wisps
[1:00:41] <+Laecerelius> It‚Äôs MR
[1:00:42] <Firemane1279> Amesha and Itzal are the best @angriestpat
[1:00:43] <$Mendin> I like the Elytron and just launch nukes at people it is not good but I am slow and lazy
[1:00:44] <flying_man_3> lol
[1:00:45] <bbqshapez> NO IT'S WORHT IT
[1:00:47] <haisho> DUDUDUDUDU
[1:00:47] <Semiconductive> have I missed Pat spending monies on the game?
[1:00:47] <bbqshapez> CRIT BUI;DS
[1:00:50] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> itzal is the only good archwing
[1:00:50] <laserbeaming> You would like Amesha, it makes you practically immortal
[1:00:51] <cizal11> if fucking only
[1:00:51] <AncelDeLambert> they BETTER
[1:00:53] <%Schadenfrauleinn> cheer1000 happy to finally catch a stream of yours live Pat!
[1:00:53] <zal_silverfang> cause everything else got a rework
[1:00:56] <bbqshapez> CRIT BUILDS USE ODONATA
[1:00:57] <flying_man_3> archwing has been reworked liek 10 times over
[1:01:00] <+kralec> It‚Äôs not the best. But it exists... I‚Äôll have to get it for my collection at some point.
[1:01:00] <+DrWolpertinger> hopefully
[1:01:01] <AncelDeLambert> needs a complete fucking overhaul
[1:01:01] <flying_man_3> and is still bad
[1:01:02] <bbqshapez> DON'T BE FOOLED
[1:01:02] <Worldbrand> yeah crit velocitus, useful for the one raid that no longer exists
[1:01:04] <+Laecerelius> I‚Äôm hoping so
[1:01:06] <%HRDSalami654> Itzal is the best for speed.
[1:01:08] <cizal11> lmao
[1:01:09] <$Mendin> If you want to farm those Cetus Wisps, Itzal is the way to go
[1:01:11] <cizal11> OH BOY
[1:01:11] <%Wallabri> sharkwing
[1:01:11] <+WILLIWJ> Railjack you mean
[1:01:11] <Apolonm> Itzal and Amesha are the only ones worth
[1:01:13] <Ropcord> oof
[1:01:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Worldbrand also great for Jordas
[1:01:15] <TropicalPsychosis> 6 MONTHS AGO
[1:01:16] <%boarqueen> sharkwing will always find you
[1:01:17] <bbqshapez> Y'ALL LIED TO PAT
[1:01:18] <+kralec> THE INCOMING NEW WAR!?!? you mean for that rooSmug
[1:01:19] <El_Samio> That is RIGHT
[1:01:21] <%HRDSalami654> It's because it's so fucking slow.
[1:01:22] <laserbeaming> Elytron is good at doing solo interceptions
[1:01:22] <+Grayhammatter> underwater archwing is literal ass
[1:01:24] <Worldbrand> True that
[1:01:25] <BinaryBetrayer> Archwing should play like Ace Combat
[1:01:26] <%Deft_Thought> I've been skipping Archwing missions
[1:01:26] <$OmegaWeltall> i love Archwing missions FeelsBadMan
[1:01:29] <bbqshapez> railjack
[1:01:32] <bbqshapez> not fortuna
[1:01:34] <%Deft_Thought> I just got to Neptune though so I'm not happy
[1:01:35] <+WILLIWJ> we also are getting the K dribe
[1:01:36] <cizal11> fuck that use hoverboards
[1:01:36] <tacostarvedbeast> baaa ba ba ba ba ba
[1:01:41] <+kralec> ah right. Railjack.
[1:01:41] <+DrWolpertinger> These mission are cancer
[1:01:43] <TropicalPsychosis> ship to ship archwing looks dope
[1:01:43] <bbqshapez> CRAZY TALK STOP ACTIVATING
[1:01:47] <AnalHaggar> archwing goes from 'tedious' to 'fun as heck' once you get a speedy goddamn gundamwing like itzal
[1:01:47] <Shinmaddrox> Because you are slower and constantly removes your buffs you apply to yourself everytime you enter the water
[1:01:51] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Did they actually confirm that archwing launchers won't take resources? I thought that was still a maybe
[1:01:53] <$Mendin> Cold, the air and water flowing
[1:01:54] <%Superstarsage> I missed what quests he's doing tonight. Anyone heard the list?
[1:01:56] <+Eclipse_knight_> its a hard c
[1:02:00] <Karhax> archwings are so cheap to use on plains
[1:02:04] <laserbeaming> I have like 300 Archwing launchers.
[1:02:06] <Karhax> it's not an issue
[1:02:07] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Superstarsage Octavia, Harrow, maybe Sacrifice
[1:02:08] <nofn> Under water archwings are very awkward to use
[1:02:08] <haisho> Hard, the land we call our home
[1:02:14] <gryffinp> @Superstarsage The reality is that he's doing octavia's anthem. In theory he's doing anthem, chains, and sacrifice, but no he's not.
[1:02:21] <$Mendin> Octavia - Chains - Apostasy Prologue
[1:02:23] <Festiveface> push to keep the dark from comin
[1:02:24] <Worldbrand> TBH they could have locked us out of archwings on venus and i wouldnt have cared. acid atmosphere and whatnot
[1:02:26] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @Superstarsage Octavia first, Chains of Harrow, Sacrifice is a maybe if he has time, but he doesn't think so
[1:02:28] <+dickbuttwoman> Archwing launchers are expensive until you actually start doing things on the plains, and then they're cheap as fuck.
[1:02:31] <%Wallabri> tak your time
[1:02:31] <$Mendin> Feel the weight of what we owe
[1:02:31] <IminyourBase> i was actually just wondering that
[1:02:32] <bbqshapez> go fast
[1:02:33] <tacostarvedbeast> @AngriestPat whats your weapon of choice in a cyber punk universe?
[1:02:36] <bbqshapez> u need it
[1:02:41] <%Superstarsage> Thanks all
[1:02:42] <thelonechris> Space organ
[1:02:43] <NeoJoker316> who needa Arch-wings? just use Titania! lmao
[1:02:46] <Slim_Lipid> DOOT DOOT
[1:02:49] <+kralec> @angriestpat by the time you grind out what you need for the quill and Cetus rep you can build a hundred of the calldowns for the plains arch wing super easy.
[1:02:50] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
[1:02:50] <BinaryBetrayer> Archwing missions are the problem, instead of going fast through space shooting things you just fumble around objectives like moths around a light bulb
[1:02:56] <+Aekrid> sup guys, so what story missions have been done so far?
[1:02:59] <%Schadenfrauleinn> It looks like it runs really well

[1:14:00] <anon_1307> they adapt
[1:14:01] <%Jpdodds> Because who knows whats out there?
[1:14:03] <Maverick2736> Sentients are the ultimate terraforming machines, so they gotta be stupidly powerful for that
[1:14:03] <bbqshapez> JUST LIKE YOU

[1:14:16] <+OranHexthief> technically all you've ever destroyed are fragments of hunhow. the big thing in the window from the start of second dream is what hunhow actually is @AngriestPat
[1:14:17] <+universefish> they went deviant
[1:14:19] <SummonerMagno> Dig up
[1:14:19] <+ShinyMonger> They saw you fuck up.
[1:14:20] <darkfiremast31> they were made by the greatest villian the galaxy has ever known
[1:14:20] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> they're literally planet sized terraformers
[1:14:21] <flying_man_3> like the Geth werent made to be super merderers
[1:14:22] <%cirdrag> they are i tau...they cameback, made of stuff they found over there
[1:14:22] <BinaryBetrayer> They are continental sized masses of self improving technology that devoured tau's resources and came back to wreck shit up.

[1:15:28] <+Crippl3> @zal_silverfang cool thanks pieFakUPie
[1:15:29] <Ropcord> some shitty primed mods and a bunch of cosmetics
[1:15:29] <calder87> but it doesn't matter because Operator mode is easier than all of this
[1:15:30] <alejandrogccs> switch weapons when dmg gets low
[1:15:33] <+Laecerelius> Fucking disco mode, killer of sentinels
[1:15:40] <darkfiremast31> @mordred_t my supra vandal parts say otherwise sir
[1:15:40] <MelBrooksKA> Pat seems to absorb MMO esoterica pretty quickly, I remember when he was like "how do play Warframe, send help!"
[1:15:43] <BinaryBetrayer> Sentient go down
[1:15:44] <%boarqueen> navigation success
[1:15:45] <%KevinsLunchbox> silly pat
[1:15:46] <%President_Miyazaki> Dig Up Stupid indeed.
[1:15:46] <Crankthulhu> Just got here, what I miss?
[1:15:47] <+kralec> @angriestpat they were Orokin super terraformers that they gave almost infinite AI control over themselves. They could build whatever they wanted. The Orokin sent them off to make them ‚Äúfertile worlds‚Äù but they decided they didn‚Äôt want to let the Orokin ruin more worlds. So then built themselves up and then jumped back to destroy the Orokin. The warframes were made to fight the sentients.
[1:15:47] <SummonerMagno> Go back 1 room
[1:15:49] <+Oedon_writhe> Okay thanks guys
[1:15:52] <gryffinp> Damn it Austin Walker.
[1:15:52] <%Schadenfrauleinn> silly rabbit
[1:15:57] <%OceanGovernor> Supra vandal dropped from a old event now only comes from Baro
[1:16:06] <%HRDSalami654> Stupid waypoint, you made me look bad!
[1:16:11] <%Sirculbs> Sure. Blame waypoint-chan
[1:16:22] <%Nirokahn> How is making everything gold ruining things?
[1:16:26] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That's lore stuff from codex entries
[1:16:30] <laserbeaming> And even more clear in The Sacrifice.
[1:16:32] <Worldbrand> they're stupid strong because they super adapt and we tried really hard to kill them
[1:16:34] <bbqshapez> Sentients have ORO So they can only be killed by being with oro
[1:16:34] <$Mendin> Gold is a heavy metal, like lead
[1:16:35] <darkfiremast31> @Nirokahn cause gold sucks as a metal
[1:16:38] <gryffinp> They're self-replicating AIs given their own empty system to exploit, I feel like that explains enough.
[1:16:38] <TheInkshow> WHY NO FAILSAFE
[1:16:39] <+VidulaSaix> Just pretend they're Reapers. Same shit.
[1:16:39] <laserbeaming> But I won't speak of that
[1:16:39] <El_Samio> Sentients were also given a precept: to survive and adapt no matter what
[1:16:39] <bbqshapez> ALA TENNO
[1:16:42] <%Divryne> Voidmen.
[1:16:44] <%Jpdodds> Goo
[1:16:45] <ivansonic08> remember no sacrifice spoilers
[1:16:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Nirokahn did you nor notice that the moon is BROKEN?
[1:16:52] <Festiveface> the void is just the warp from warhammer
[1:16:53] <+Laecerelius> The Emperor of Mankind would approve of the Orokin‚Äôs love of gold
[1:16:54] <BinaryBetrayer> The Void is just this game's version of warp travel.
[1:16:57] <zal_silverfang> there literally was a failsafe

[1:17:15] <%Jpdodds> Fuck off Simaris
[1:17:18] <+ShinyMonger> Have you ever tried the Buzlok? It takes some work, but it has an insane riven disposition and can easily reach over 100% crit with just one mod and it's alt fire buff. Best part is the rivens are super cheap. I got a broken damage/crit damage riven for 150-ish plat.
[1:17:21] <calder87> @CaptainJax the cephalon internet
[1:17:21] <Crankthulhu> Warframe's story is basically just Terminator in space

[1:17:48] <Midnight_Crest> Simaris is the biggest tsundere
[1:17:50] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Valkyre is great for sentients
[1:17:50] <+dickbuttwoman> Valkyr is unkillable
[1:17:52] <+SevenDeadlyCyns> Valkyr is the best warframe
[1:17:52] <cerberuscarmine> valkyr is best girl
[1:17:53] <flying_man_3> @Crankthulhu nah is much more just EVA as much as I hate to admit it
[1:17:53] <Worldbrand> Which warframe is lady stiltman
[1:17:55] <GandhiTheTerrible> Valkyr is bae <3
[1:17:55] <TheInkshow> She has the booty
[1:17:57] <darkfiremast31> simaris best waifu
[1:17:57] <+G_Thunders> The story is basically just Dark Souls in space
[1:17:57] <Ropcord> @hulkster95 shit you're right
[1:17:57] <+Ryuartyi_> Valkyr is the best

[1:18:12] <Crankthulhu> @flying_man_3 I know, was making joke about Sentients
[1:18:14] <+kralec> @angriestpat the act of warping back to the Orokin system makes them ‚Äúbarren‚Äù or something. They were weakened. Garra, the Warframe, murdered a Sentient on the Plains of Eidolon. The Eidolons are the remains of the Sentient trying to rebuild itself.

[1:25:43] <aeonicvector> I'd look up Ordan's story if your interested
[1:25:46] <%boarqueen> more as punishment for attempted assassination
[1:25:47] <+Crippl3> @AngriestPat if you get the little scannable thingies around the galaxy map, they slowly unlock audio diaries of Ordis' backstory

[1:26:10] <Caidezes> So soory.
[1:26:11] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat he was a war villain more like it, mercenary that killed tons off innocents and killed a few orokin before he was turned into ordis, his story is hidden in codexes
[1:26:11] <+Mictlan93> Is he doing the Octavia missions?

[1:26:26] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat check out Ordis's story in the fragments. its some 40k bullshit
[1:26:28] <%Wallabri> in space, everyone is Canadian
[1:26:29] <+WILLIWJ> I mean the Devs are in Canada
[1:26:30] <Tucker0603> ORDIS was a badass Berseker
[1:26:31] <Worldbrand> that uh could have used some operator dialogue tbh
[1:26:40] <TheInkshow> did they patch that?
[1:26:41] <El_Samio> Warframs got a surprising amount of the lores
[1:26:43] <AncelDeLambert> Everyone ready for some Barf-frame?
[1:26:44] <+kralec> @angriestpat when the sentients came back from the other system, they fucked up the Orokin tech. They couldn‚Äôt stop the Sentients from hacking the shit out of them. They tried a bunch of shit to stop them. This is why the warframes use guns and swords. Had to dumb down the tech to beat the sentients.
[1:26:49] <%whistlehunter> Orokin were also basically Hitler too so he was a villain taken out by bigger villains
[1:26:59] <%SuttonTM> @AngriestPat are you playing this on PS4 or PC? rooThink
[1:26:59] <darkfiremast31> @Worldbrand this technically was before your operator was more then just a face to look at
[1:27:00] <+ajcritfumble> @AngriestPat if you don't progress the quest any further fro now you can play the rest of the game without ordis's constantly annoying voice, bar the other quests
[1:27:08] <$Mendin> He was Hitokiri Battousai
[1:27:08] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Ordis's story is some 40k bullshit

[1:45:44] <Crankthulhu> @AngriestPat When you're a super-AI, all other lifeforms are beasts

[2:03:26] <%TaifuDragon> @Tucker0603 Corinth*
[2:03:27] <+joey_jrpg> maybe because most guns are loud because its a fucking gun
[2:03:27] <puhff> Pat my ears plase
[2:03:28] <%TaifuDragon> >:(
[2:03:30] <beltheria> of course it's powerful, Pat. It's a 4-guage shotgun.

[2:23:49] <bbqshapez> Pat asks for explanantion-takes off headphones as explanation is given
[2:23:53] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat great job stealing from special needs kids
[2:23:55] <bbqshapez> CRAZY TALK
[2:23:56] <darkfiremast31> without the focus of the tenno ways or lotus teachings
[2:23:57] <GandhiTheTerrible> tenno power potential is broken
[2:24:02] <il_barbiero> eat sand, disabled child
[2:24:03] <%OceanGovernor> apatCrazyhead
[2:24:04] <+Thorn14> is that pat drinking...WATER?!
[2:24:07] <Ropcord> nitain and oxium :O
[2:24:07] <+Crippl3> Hey yall you know what would be good? Stop fucking making shitty jokes about autistic people
[2:24:13] <+Thorn14> NITAIN rooREE
[2:24:14] <+Crippl3> cool thanks
[2:24:15] <darkfiremast31> tenno power becomes like that of a beast with no end to its hunger
[2:24:16] <+anar_bael> from what I've seen the only limiters of tenno are time, experience and creativity
[2:24:17] <blackorchidKI2> I think it might help if the Warframe comics have good backstory for Chains of Harrow and the Octavia quest
[2:24:19] <Prancer_Slenderfriend> @AngriestPat brings his tigris prime to a mission with an unkillable ghost, brings his inaros to a mission that attacks his mind directly with that binaural shit
[2:24:22] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> can't wait for Pat to explain the spooks in next week's podcast
[2:24:27] <+Crippl3> Not really
[2:24:27] <punkthepsychopenguin> 4head1000 Pat if your character played music in space could you call it a.... Space Jam?
[2:24:29] <ravencloak13> Tenno. Are. Demi-Gods.
[2:24:29] <il_barbiero> PAT AT RISK
[2:24:29] <aeonicvector> nope
[2:24:31] <+Thorn14> nah
[2:24:31] <+Crippl3> It's like half-cinematic
[2:24:32] <$Mendin> Not quite
[2:24:32] <%boarqueen> no this is more minor
[2:24:32] <+universefish> sacrifice is much more
[2:24:33] <%pennykettle_> mini
[2:24:33] <KnivesEve> people make jokes? thats fuck up guys
[2:24:33] <%Arxel1> Nope
[2:24:33] <+MarshallLee67> not really
[2:24:33] <%TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Tel Paige to put on headphones and watch the stream for the biarual shit!
[2:24:34] <+Thorn14> Just a really fucking good one
[2:24:36] <%mordred_t> No, not cinematic.
[2:24:38] <+Zceryll> nooo
[2:24:38] <+VidulaSaix> Sacrficie is WAY more
[2:24:39] <arfsm95> @AngriestPat the effects are loud, the rest is fine
[2:24:39] <zal_silverfang> nah you dont talk in this
[2:24:40] <aeonicvector> this was more like Silver grove, side quest
[2:24:41] <%mordred_t> Just great.
[2:24:41] <+Lordgale119> Sacrifice is WAY BIGGER
[2:24:44] <Ropcord> it's not that cinematic but it's got BIG LORE
[2:24:46] <+Lordgale119> MUCH BIGG
[2:24:47] <%Arxel1> Also @AngriestPat read the Harrow Comic after this :^)
[2:24:51] <Tucker0603> sacrifice is SO MUCH MORE
[2:24:52] <%OceanGovernor> WHAT
[2:24:53] <punkthepsychopenguin> HE GETS IT FOLKS
[2:24:57] <+kralec> @angriestpat they were infused with the power of ‚Äúthe void‚Äù a place where shit doesn‚Äôt make sense and order breaks down. The Orokin just started to touch on it before they were destroyed. The sentients are literally destroy by it. The void is fucking nuts. The only reason the Orokin even entered the void was to escape the Sentients. It was an ACCIDENT that the Tenno were even in the void. A Jump gone wrong out a whole colony shop there.
[2:24:58] <+Thorn14> Sacrifice is WAY more
[2:24:58] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @AngriestPat Im unsubbing for that
[2:25:02] <cizal11> "ohhhh it's ash KETCHUM"

[2:25:04] <ravencloak13> @arxel1 That actually a thing?
[2:25:05] <+AXL808> not BIG LORE but a still a good quest; Sacrifice is BIG LORE
[2:25:12] <$TheNeedlesD> Theres also an Octavia tie-in comic to read after this
[2:25:12] <B1n0va> I believe harrow quesy did have a comic

[2:29:11] <Futurecity10> weaponized autism
[2:29:16] <punkthepsychopenguin> What if the chosen undead was autistic.
[2:29:20] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Pay attention to their FACES
[2:29:20] <acridPaladin> Harrow is canonically autistic. Rebbeca confirmed on twitter
[2:29:21] <%pennykettle_> big good
[2:29:21] <$TheNeedlesD> @AngriestPat Get a lot of Siphons if you dont and equip them
[2:29:22] <ape_hawk> WHAT IF A TENNO WAS A SHELDON
[2:29:25] <Ajaximus> DE confirmed he's legit on the spectrum
[2:29:26] <Croetec> DE keeping it real
[2:29:26] <reonome> weaponized austism

[2:29:33] <BinaryBetrayer> Literally weaponized autosm
[2:29:33] <stunlockpop> "full blown autism" =_=
[2:29:34] <Tucker0603> WEAPONIZED AUTISM SOUNDS RADICAL
[2:29:34] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> Rell has a comic that shows how all this stuff happened, he's definitely autistic
[2:29:35] <%Jpdodds> Pat got a degree in this
[2:29:36] <%boarqueen> his autism didn't really affect his transference tho, margulis was just a shit
[2:29:36] <%whistlehunter> You mean the chosen undead ISNT autistic? @punkthepsychopenguin
[2:29:37] <%Sam_Tzu> bazinga

[2:29:45] <El_Samio> Reminder: Pat studied psychology
[2:29:46] <hntronium> WHAT IF A TENNO WAS A NAZI
[2:29:47] <+Dasbubba> Also consider this, rell never got put in the dream. So he's been around for a REALLY long time.
[2:29:49] <ronyncato87> So...autistic characters in this universe automatically become villains?
[2:29:49] <%Codename_Torch> lol
[2:29:50] <+kralec> @angriestpat they couldn‚Äôt use him as a weapon, so he was ‚Äúrejected‚Äù cast aside.
[2:29:50] <saltyvest> WHAT IF A TENNO WAS A CHOSEN UNDEAD

[2:30:02] <%GarbageNirvana> Had I not played that one Mass Effect mission I probably would have gotten into this a little more
[2:30:03] <acridPaladin> You need the traps from Simaris
[2:30:04] <punkthepsychopenguin> @whistlehunter You know what good point
[2:30:06] <%Arxel1> @AngriestPat and also the other kids were laaaaame, read the comics
[2:30:06] <%Divryne> You buy them from Simaris.
[2:30:08] <puhff> What if a tenno could love???
[2:30:08] <ravencloak13> @ronyncato87 No, he‚Äôs actually a full on hero but something happened
[2:30:09] <bbqshapez> kinetic sihpons

[2:30:17] <%Jpdodds> yuo need a FEW
[2:30:17] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat there was a comic to go along with this update that shows what it was like on the zariman for rell after the void incident
[2:30:18] <%President_Miyazaki> You need kinetic siphons
[2:30:18] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> You need like 10-20
[2:30:19] <+khalcipher> Not so fun fact I was like "should not this be easy" and went to do studies to me and now i know that i have aspenger everybody!
[2:30:19] <+QuadraticGravity> you need a bunch
[2:30:19] <+G_Thunders> Except it‚Äôs just ‚Äúmental illness = scary villain‚Äù like everyone complains about in all other games
[2:30:20] <+Dasbubba> @ronyncato87 You'll see that he's not the villain of this quest.
[2:30:21] <NeoJoker316> the simaris traps
[2:30:22] <Croetec> you'll need a good handful
[2:30:24] <Wonky_Chicken_Room> man i need to get back into this game but i am consumed with WoW
[2:30:25] <Worldbrand> YOUR GEAR BAR IS SO BARREN
[2:30:26] <%PatNTheHat> I feel really shitty for saying this... but would Rell's preferred Warframe have been Octavia?
[2:30:29] <%Codename_Torch> @AngriestPat Rell is literally weaponized autism

[2:33:07] <ChronoJXF> @Darkrun2 it's fine if u wanna invest learning things and invest time on it
[2:33:08] <AncelDeLambert> Warframe has introduced a crappy fighting game to their arsenal game

[2:34:37] <NeoJoker316> Bustin, bustin, bustin...
[2:34:38] <+Oedon_writhe> Rell is an autist and needs his fidget spinner to focus
[2:34:41] <SchroedingersFerret> >:(
[2:34:41] <Croetec> Go get'em Ray
[2:34:42] <incredibleCrayon> I thought it said blind shitcomb

[2:34:50] <darkfiremast31> technically
[2:34:51] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Don't worry someone else is here
[2:34:55] <cerberuscarmine> daaved cahge
[2:34:59] <darkfiremast31> you could say tenno and warframes have "EYES ON THE INSIDE"
[2:34:59] <BinaryBetrayer> Is the instakill ghost chasing him already?
[2:35:05] <+FrostedZaibatsu> You know whats spookier. Infested with chainsaws
[2:35:06] <%Jpdodds> DONT LOOK IN THE TRAP
[2:35:10] <$Mendin> Those are what happens when the Orokin tried nanomachine augments and they went Zerg instead

[2:35:15] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat Trap is required
[2:35:16] <%OceanGovernor> To be fair to Rell even without autism dealing with an old god for hundreds of years will drive anyone nutty
[2:35:19] <%boarqueen> use da siphon
[2:35:19] <+Cybercobra2> really this mission needs to be played with a orange energy phage
[2:35:26] <darkfiremast31> @Worldbrand already beat sacrifice
[2:35:28] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> This quest is what made me realize the importance of keybinds for gear

[2:35:35] <darkfiremast31> @Worldbrand im just bad at recognizing shit in the moment
[2:35:36] <punkthepsychopenguin> @OceanGovernor Isn't that technically the plot of dark souls 1-3
[2:35:43] <ravencloak13> @oceangovernor The autism probably helped him deal with it better actually
[2:35:47] <dekkitout> my god youre literally busting ghosts
[2:35:49] <darkfiremast31> also didnt want to throw spoilers

[2:36:23] <Festiveface> @ravencloak13 probably not deal with it better, but just be able to see that it was its own being instead of just a dimension

[2:46:30] <darkfiremast31> I'd sub if I didn't have bills
[2:46:30] <punkthepsychopenguin> pogchamp1000 I guess that elevator was never gonna give you up, always gonna let you down. It's gonna run around and hurt you. Always gonna make you cry, always gonna say goodbye. It told a lie, and hurt you.
[2:46:33] <+Thorn14> 1 more I believe
[2:46:34] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> IS FINE
[2:46:34] <%SmolBluGhost> that thar space
[2:46:43] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> rule of 3

[2:47:01] <%pennykettle_> I unironically like that song
[2:47:04] <punkthepsychopenguin> Pat was not happy.
[2:47:06] <+Thorn14> WutFace
[2:47:09] <+Thorn14> Oh well
[2:47:09] <%legendfather_of_giants> that's fine
[2:47:11] <dekkitout> *flips shit*
[2:47:11] <%Divryne> !uptime
[2:47:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 47m 13s.
[2:47:13] <%whistlehunter> Its only an hour Patrick
[2:47:13] <aeonicvector> i mean, fair
[2:47:14] <Chichen> @AngriestPat after the quest look around your ship
[2:47:14] <EASrake> !SHIT FLIPPED!
[2:47:15] <cizal11> there's no way he's doing sacrifice tonight these two are plenty long
[2:47:16] <%OceanGovernor> Well there is a short tease for it
[2:47:16] <KnivesEve> drink some red bull
[2:47:16] <+AXL808> guess that guy is going to flip hi sshit
[2:47:16] <+NWR_James> I demand shit-flipping
[2:47:17] <reonome> time to flip some shit
[2:47:17] <%SmolBluGhost> noice
[2:47:18] <%TaifuDragon> it's only an hour
[2:47:21] <bbqshapez> but you can do apostasy prologue
[2:47:21] <+Dasbubba> Fair enough. Sacrifice is like an hour long.
[2:47:22] <RetributionP> baby pat
[2:47:23] <$TheNeedlesD> You have enough time for Apostasy.
[2:47:23] <ronyncato87> Wait, this is supposed to be Science Fiction, right? What is all this Care Bears noise about collecting emotions?
[2:47:23] <missingangle> Everyone be flippin shit now
[2:47:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> That's fine, I still haven't even been able to play the sacrifice, so that means I gotta catch up
[2:47:28] <TheInkshow> But hollow knight
[2:47:29] <punkthepsychopenguin> Almost 3 hours is an appropriate amount of time.
[2:47:29] <%sassyquatch963> do prolouge
[2:47:30] <BinaryBetrayer> Get apostasy first
[2:47:30] <$Mendin> Pat do the Apostasy Prologue after this it's very short
[2:47:31] <Shastafield> then we riot
[2:47:31] <Lysdexic9541> Let the shit flipping commence
[2:47:32] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> Do the prologue at least
[2:47:32] <Worldbrand> It'd be good to do apostasy now to emulate the year we had to wait
[2:47:32] <Ropcord> @AngriestPat apostasy prologue is like a three minute walk and a cutscene
[2:47:34] <%legendfather_of_giants> you can do Apostasy just fine tho @AngriestPat
[2:47:35] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Mmm sweaty
[2:47:35] <+Thorn14> its VERY Soft Science Fiction
[2:47:35] <bbqshapez> PROLOGUE
[2:47:38] <mornerboi> if pat doesn't do sacrafice tonight i'll shit in a secret place
[2:47:38] <BinaryBetrayer> it's like 5 seconds
[2:47:39] <Ajaximus> Do the prologue
[2:47:39] <+OranHexthief> at least do apostacy prologue @AngriestPat it's really short. like one mission short
[2:47:41] <Ajaximus> it's mega short
[2:47:41] <zakti_prime> stream wf again soon
[2:47:43] <haisho> BIG LORE TIME
[2:47:46] <%whistlehunter> @AngriestPat We're all tired and sweaty, hot and bothered
[2:47:50] <+NWR_James> Do hat-stream next time. Make BIG SHIT FLIPS
[2:47:53] <Tuskor13> haha i get the joke he referenced Robo's theme song.
[2:47:53] <+Thorn14> Yeah at least do Aposty Proglogue
[2:48:00] <KnivesEve> prologue is like 5 seconds
[2:48:01] <+Thorn14> Thats super duper short
[2:48:04] <fmc009> @AngriestPat Sacrifice is like an hour so if you make another stream commit to doing something else. And hey, new frame is on right now
[2:48:10] <Incrodon> @AngriestPat Hey, are you aware the revive mechanic is cannon in Warframe? You know, the the thing that lets you respawn after dying?
[2:48:19] <%whistlehunter> Do Prologue yea
[2:48:21] <%PatNTheHat> In other words, he locked his mind in his warframe so he could survive his mortal body
[2:48:23] <+Dasbubba> Rell is more or less the protagonist of Persona 3 at the end of that game in a way.
[2:48:25] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @ronyncato87 The easiest way to explain it is that a transport vessel got caught in hyperspace, and gave these teenage kids superpowers and minor insanity. Rell was autistic, so it had a bit of a stronger effect on his psyche
[2:48:31] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Pfftahaha
[2:48:32] <Astr0Naut1cal> What frame is he running?
[2:48:36] <cizal11> damn he ate shit HARD there
[2:48:38] <ronyncato87> This is literally Kingdom Hearts/ Care Bears lol
[2:48:39] <$TheNeedlesD> Inaros
[2:48:40] <+Thorn14> You know from a distance h looks like Super High Tech Batman
[2:48:41] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> AsterBodhran Inaros, sand boi
[2:48:42] <AncelDeLambert> so unlike Inaros he just straight got locked up
[2:48:42] <+dickbuttwoman> Possibly the most right thing to do ever
[2:48:46] <+dickbuttwoman> Rell is big hero man
[2:48:47] <+Dasbubba> @Astr0Naut1cal Inaros with the ramses skin on
[2:48:48] <%whistlehunter> @Hunk_Of_Dunk less teenage and more 7-13
[2:48:48] <+Thorn14> with the ears and cape
[2:48:49] <Chichen> RELLMO
[2:48:56] <ravencloak13> @astr0naut1cal Inaros
[2:48:57] <+Thorn14> Rellmo is big and strong
[2:49:01] <%boarqueen> rell is basically pat putting his mind in a toilet/warframe
[2:49:01] <BinaryBetrayer> @Hunk_Of_Dunk Dont forget that the kid had thousands of people, and everyone went murderously batshit insane but only the kids got powers, adults all died.
[2:49:05] <ravencloak13> @astr0naut1cal Anubis skin
[2:49:05] <%PatNTheHat> Fuck Rellmo is strong
[2:49:08] <+camodikk> which quest is he on again?
[2:49:10] <%riantDeliration> im not sure you could say hes controlling them
[2:49:10] <+anar_bael> Sometimes the enemy can't be beat in a lifetime so you've got to do what you can to continue the fight
[2:49:13] <BinaryBetrayer> RELLMO
[2:49:13] <Chichen> @AngriestPat RELLMO IS YOUR SON
[2:49:13] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Space mom judging people LUL
[2:49:13] <17sevens> Nothing suggests it had more of an effect on him, he went a different path because he was kicked out. No telling what causes what.
[2:49:14] <zal_silverfang> @Hunk_Of_Dunk and also might have made him tune into something... "new". let us not forget that
[2:49:14] <%OceanGovernor> To be fair the man in the wall is doing it
[2:49:15] <%GarbageNirvana> Speaking of which, do these kids not age at all or what
[2:49:17] <haisho> MOONLIGHT THRESHCONE
[2:49:17] <%whistlehunter> RELLMO/10
[2:49:18] <BlitzChocula> I always found the green revive gas that Frames spray other Frames with to be eerily similar to infested gasses
[2:49:19] <AncelDeLambert> actually, did we find out what happened to Inaros, or did he die fighting the Sentients?
[2:49:20] <Lysdexic9541> iktf
[2:49:21] <+Thorn14> Apparently not Nirvana
[2:49:23] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat his mind is smashed into many pieces, so he doesnt really have "control" over them
[2:49:23] <gryffinp> Now THAT I can empathize with.
[2:49:25] <+Thorn14> or at least very slow
[2:49:25] <%Schadenfrauleinn> cheer1000 Ok, just started downloading Warframe here; you've got me interested!
[2:49:29] <+Thorn14> due to Void shenanigans
[2:49:31] <%legendfather_of_giants> @GarbageNirvana they spent a WHILE in cryosleep
[2:49:32] <Astr0Naut1cal> Thanks @Dasbubba and @TheNeedlesD
[2:49:38] <%Jpdodds> @OceanGovernor Its Rell, MITW
[2:49:40] <Ropcord> so why did ballas think it was a good idea to give rell a warframe :thinking:
[2:49:42] <+Thorn14> and yeah a LOOOOONG time in Cyro sleep
[2:49:44] <%Spydurman> LUL
[2:49:46] <%Jpdodds> @OceanGovernor aint this
[2:49:49] <+kuervojones> Momma! Just killed a man!
[2:49:55] <+dickbuttwoman> @Ropcord because Ballas don't give a fuck
[2:49:58] <%boarqueen> space tunes
[2:49:59] <+AntithesisEK> Inaros defected from the Orokin to defend Mars' peoples IIRC
[2:49:59] <Ropcord> fair
[2:49:59] <+d00msdaydan> hold on rell lemme scan this mixtape
[2:49:59] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He DID end up finding Momma LUL

[2:50:01] <%riantDeliration> always time for a somachord
[2:50:01] <%legendfather_of_giants> @Ropcord because he thought it would be funny
[2:50:03] <themightyseptopus> gotta find my ma ma
[2:50:03] <+AntithesisEK> they didn't like that
[2:50:06] <hntronium> I DID IT FOR MY MOMMA
[2:50:06] <ravencloak13> @ropcord To let him focus his powers and not be a walking bomb
[2:50:09] <+Grayhammatter> space tunes PogChamp
[2:50:12] <+Thorn14> Rell's not a bad guy just he spent a LOOOONG time dealing with shit
[2:50:16] <%OceanGovernor> Well its Rell's mind broken and the man int he wall trying to keep it that way so he can influence our world
[2:50:16] <AncelDeLambert> @ropcord cuz the Orokin were fucking stupid and selfish idiots
[2:50:19] <%GarbageNirvana> Daryl Strawberry hurtling through space.gif
[2:50:28] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Whats the 1 year Sub badge? is it Elmo?
[2:50:31] <%whistlehunter> I DID IT TO MY MOMMA* @hntronium

[2:50:56] <viewtifulr> Ready for Pat to one shot a kid
[2:50:58] <+Thorn14> BELLY RUBS
[2:50:58] <$serpenttucker> GORDON'S BROTHER, JOHN FREEMAN
[2:50:59] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> @whistlehunter Yay
[2:51:02] <+SvenHolgersson> I hope theres a special place in heaven for him
[2:51:03] <%pennykettle_> Pat what if you are a Warframe and you are being controlled by a dreaming kid
[2:51:04] <BinaryBetrayer> Time to kill an autistic kid stuck inside a frame that you bullied while trapped in hyperspace
[2:51:04] <%PatNTheHat> @AngriestPat Hey, he DID become immortal by doing so
[2:51:05] <%President_Miyazaki> Time to tell him about all the bunnies your gonna have Pat.
[2:51:06] <+Dasbubba> Rell never got put in the dream so he's been awake and suffering for a REALLY long time.
[2:51:09] <+TootPirate> GHOST HOUSE
[2:51:17] <laserbeaming> This is not at all represetative of the rest of Warframe
[2:51:18] <Festiveface> crotch bag
[2:51:22] <TheInkshow> Nah he was already damge
[2:51:22] <$serpenttucker> THE PANTS WERE DEAD
[2:51:22] <+Thorn14> Yeah Rell got a fucking RAW Deal
[2:51:23] <+kuervojones> @BinaryBetrayer Sure, it sounds bad when you put it that way
[2:51:26] <ravencloak13> Time to pull a Old Yeller
[2:51:36] <%OceanGovernor> Rell had a hard life FeelsBadMan
[2:51:42] <%President_Miyazaki> About to be Of Mice and Men.
[2:51:43] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> sure Lotus...TOTALLY illusions...
[2:51:45] <fazoburquina> Oh boy is it THE FIGHT?
[2:51:46] <TropicalPsychosis> TAKE THIS RETARD BEHIND THE WOOD SHED
[2:51:46] <laserbeaming> His temple is SICK. I love it
[2:51:48] <%Arxel1> And its true Binary
[2:51:52] <%pennykettle_> rell has been alive for like thousands of years tied up
[2:51:53] <%Jpdodds> @serpenttucker JOHN FREEMAN WHO IS GORDON FREEMANS BROTHER WAS ONE DAY IN OFFICE, TYPING ON A COMPUTER
[2:51:56] <TheInkshow> "Here lies Rell, he never scored"
[2:51:56] <+OranHexthief> but are they really delusions though rooThink
[2:51:57] <BinaryBetrayer> Its true all of it
[2:52:01] <ronyncato87> Okay, so the autistic character isn't a villain, but he's a dangerously chaotic force that needs to be destroyed? okay
[2:52:04] <AncelDeLambert> the Veil are fucking wierd
[2:52:04] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> big mood
[2:52:05] <%pennykettle_> THEY ARE
[2:52:06] <gryffinp> Hexis for life.
[2:52:08] <+Thorn14> Its fiiiiine
[2:52:08] <+d00msdaydan> oh right, this is that part everyone hated before the operator rework
[2:52:08] <Zombrocom> The Red Veil are nutcases
[2:52:09] <%SolitudeOtM> @AngriestPat Would you let your mind be stuck in a warframe if it means you could live forever and be a badass Cyber ninja/knight/paladin/pirate/mummy?
[2:52:09] <haisho> NOPE
[2:52:09] <$TheNeedlesD> Has, he noticed that these missions have to do with the different rep factions?
[2:52:10] <+kuervojones> Not yet
[2:52:10] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> no
[2:52:12] <Karhax> not yet
[2:52:12] <%Jpdodds> not yet
[2:52:13] <%Halowood> Isn't the derelict ship the Zariman 10-0?
[2:52:13] <cizal11> not yet
[2:52:13] <%pennykettle_> no yetr
[2:52:13] <+Thorn14> Not yet
[2:52:13] <TheInkshow> Yeah, cool
[2:52:14] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Nope
[2:52:14] <@ThePlotHole> Not at the moment
[2:52:15] <aeonicvector> Every faction iirc
[2:52:15] <%Arxel1> Not yet
[2:52:15] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> negative
[2:52:16] <Zombrocom> Hexis got nothing yet
[2:52:16] <%Sam_Tzu> just burn down the ship
[2:52:19] <BinaryBetrayer> Soon (Tm)
[2:52:19] <+TootPirate> No, but DE wants to have quests for all factions
[2:52:20] <AncelDeLambert> not yet, which sucks
[2:52:21] <+Thorn14> Im sure they will
[2:52:24] <BlitzChocula> so if the Tenno cast out Rell, who made the Harrow warframe? Red Veil?
[2:52:25] <Solidus_113> not yet
[2:52:25] <dekkitout> i signed up for the zephyr and nekros mods SeriousSloth
[2:52:26] <laserbeaming> Not yet. Neither Meridian nor HExis has
[2:52:27] <zal_silverfang> most of the factions are a bit nuts
[2:52:31] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> New Loka is like the only ones that are objectively not nuts
[2:52:32] <%whistlehunter> Yea Lotus you sure know a lot about the Void for a SENTIENT, know a lot of stuff about the place that is literally anathema to your kind
[2:52:33] <+Dasbubba> Well the Red Veil do run on the belief of Purge everything for purity.
[2:52:33] <+kuervojones> Veil, Loka, and Suda
[2:52:34] <Astr0Naut1cal> Would chroma be a good solo frame?
[2:52:37] <AncelDeLambert> Meridian has Clem
[2:52:39] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Octavia is Suda isn't she?
[2:52:39] <%legendfather_of_giants> @BlitzChocula He had one and was then kicked out
[2:52:42] <TheInkshow> Meridian sucks cus Grineer
[2:52:43] <%Metal_Slime_King> Suda is Octavia
[2:52:47] <Hunk_Of_Dunk> @ronyncato87 He's more like a mistreatment-induced vessel for something much worse. He's only suffering the way he is now
[2:52:48] <ravencloak13> @ronyncato87 A kid that‚Äôs LITERALLY been tortured by a Elder God trying to keep it from wiping out EVERYONE...
[2:52:50] <+kralec> I did! And oh boy are they! Red veil are legit cultists.
[2:52:50] <dekkitout> so clemframe?
[2:52:51] <+Sdeje> Dark Souls Time!!!
[2:52:51] <%OceanGovernor> Graxx skins?
[2:52:52] <El_Samio> Graxx Skins lol
[2:52:54] <gryffinp> Steel meridian has this quest sort of and also the Kela De Thaym fight and Defection missions. Hexis have NOTHING. It's great.
[2:52:55] <fazoburquina> I'd love a Grineer style frame
[2:52:56] <AncelDeLambert> GRAKATA
[2:52:59] <%President_Miyazaki> A grineer one wouldn't really make sense.
[2:53:00] <+Cybercobra2> so you came to that conclusion too huh? the veil are dangerous nutballs
[2:53:00] <%SolitudeOtM> Isn't Mirage Grineer styled?
[2:53:00] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> whats that smell?
[2:53:01] <Fabric_tester> Graxx?
[2:53:01] <NeoJoker316> perrin, glast gambit?
[2:53:01] <aeonicvector> Harrow, Nidus, Octavia, Titania
[2:53:02] <%GarbageNirvana> That's...basicalliy the graxx skins, yeah
[2:53:03] <+Thorn14> its just Clem
[2:53:05] <saltyvest> ENTER THE BURNING ANUS
[2:53:05] <EASrake> BED of CHAOS Monkas
[2:53:06] <ROBOSAPION6499> @metal_slime_king wait really?
[2:53:13] <hero1151> ya her name is Saryn
[2:53:17] <ravencloak13> Time for Bed of Chaos
[2:53:18] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> ITS BLOOD
[2:53:20] <AncelDeLambert> A Clemframe would just be all drills
[2:53:20] <+Thorn14> There's a prequel comic
[2:53:26] <%whistlehunter> MY BURNING ANUS
[2:53:26] <Festiveface> @AngriestPat it is in the comic that came with the update
[2:53:28] <+Thorn14> No, not a Clemframe, just playable Clem
[2:53:28] <+Bupkis7> GRAX SKINS
[2:53:28] <Maverick2736> IZ BLUUUUD
[2:53:30] <%whistlehunter> AND MY BURNING BLADE
[2:53:32] <%Metal_Slime_King> Suda's quest is the octavia quest I meant
[2:53:33] <+unfoldingchoas> isnt vauban grineer style warframe
[2:53:36] <Solidus_113> now we a DOOM level
[2:53:40] <BinaryBetrayer> There's a comic about it
[2:53:44] <ronyncato87> Yeah, this game's writers can officially teabag a bear trap...
[2:53:46] <+dickbuttwoman> Not just ostracised. He didn't get cryogenic sleep. He's been awake the entire time.
[2:53:47] <%boarqueen> well technically he is coded since they don't say it in game
[2:53:53] <Worldbrand> the amp's gonna help with this
[2:53:53] <Daniel_Is_I> @AngriestPat There's a prologue webcomic about Rell you can read online
[2:53:53] <%PatNTheHat> Oh good, Pat has an amp
[2:53:53] <%Everpresent_Overseer> A grineer retrofitted one would be neat though, like how Valkyr was torn apart
[2:53:56] <%OceanGovernor> @AngriestPat there is a comic about rell you sould read after this
[2:53:57] <$SGrim> This feels like a Donut Steel OC background, but it's fairly well executed, so I have no major complaints. rooShrug
[2:53:59] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> going down down
[2:53:59] <ravencloak13> @unfoldingchoas Not Grinner. He‚Äôs more Corpus
[2:54:00] <+Thorn14> Its not meant as a flaw
[2:54:01] <+PeaceCentennial> oh this looks like some spoiler shit i'll just be going
[2:54:02] <$GoCoSpace> !uptime

[2:54:13] <%legendfather_of_giants> @AngriestPat He also didn't get cryosleep, he's been awake the whole time
[2:54:14] <+Thorn14> its not like "haha laugh at the kid with autism"
[2:54:15] <Ropcord> man commodore prime is sick FeelsBadMan
[2:54:16] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> ohh new Amp? What did Pat build?

[2:55:45] <+Crippl3> This quest fucking sucks with the default amp, lol
[2:55:45] <+Grayhammatter> wow... i wish i had an amp for this crap
[2:55:46] <zal_silverfang> this quest was so bad before they aadded the weapons
[2:55:59] <%Superstarsage> no amps? better have a respawn loop

[2:56:13] <+VidulaSaix> its almost like they're glowing or something
[2:56:16] <+Dasbubba> @ronyncato87 The main thing of this is less that Rell is the villain since he's not but more that he got pushed out and ended up becoming the one holding back "The man in the Wall" since he was more attuned than the others were. Your basically trying to help bring him back to his sense in a way since he's both been stuck in his frame for a REALLY long time while also holding back some entity that's been trying to take over his mind.

[2:59:27] <Lysdexic9541> LUL
[2:59:27] <BinaryBetrayer> It's a valid interpretation if you don't believe in void entities
[2:59:28] <zakti_prime> THE MAN IN THE WALL IS REAL

[2:59:38] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> it's a good diagnosis
[2:59:38] <+AntithesisEK> a degree in jumping to conclusions is more like it
[2:59:39] <saltyvest> And so the hero tenno fell down a hole and fucking died warframe is over
[2:59:41] <+Laecerelius> Tzeench wanted to be best buds
[2:59:46] <+Youwereeatenbyalid> he's just unfortunately wrong
[2:59:48] <bbqshapez> SOMETHINGS OUT THERE WATCHING US KIDDO
[2:59:49] <%OceanGovernor> I never saw the story as Rell's autism being his flaw, just his loneliness allowed an alien entity to get close. Rell still recognized the nature of the Man in the Wall and fought him for hundreds of years. Rell is a big hero
[2:59:49] <haisho> You fell off? What is this? Hollow Knight?
[2:59:50] <+Dasbubba> @kwangalang He is wrong. The thing talking is something that found Rell in the void, The Man in the Wall he's been talking about.
[2:59:50] <+agomera666> The man in the wall is talking to you, Pat. It‚Äôs real
[2:59:51] <ravencloak13> @blackorchidki2 The thing talking was the thing in the Void.
[2:59:52] <BinaryBetrayer> He made friends with ninja Tzeench
[2:59:52] <+gucci_sama> good guess pat
[2:59:55] <%legendfather_of_giants> Man in the Wall is just Tzeench @AngriestPat
[2:59:56] <ROBOSAPION6499> @kwangalang pat literally has a degree you can't argue with him lol
[2:59:56] <Ajaximus> @AngriestPat That's not DID he's literally possessed
[2:59:57] <+Solutha> Pat the lore gun jumper
[2:59:57] <+kralec> Just wait till after he frees Rell chat. The proof comes out.
[2:59:57] <%PatNTheHat> It would be SO much better for everyone if he just had DID...
[2:59:58] <custoadian> it's a good conclusion, but ultimately a red herring
[2:59:59] <+Bupkis7> SUPER WRONG AS USUAL
[3:00:00] <AnalHaggar> and yeah, the man in the wall is certainly some shit
[3:00:03] <%pennykettle_> T POSE, DO IT RELL

[3:04:18] <BlitzChocula> ROOK the KAVAT.
[3:04:21] <mornerboi> "Operator who thought he'd lost all hope loses last additional bit of hope he didn't even know he still had."
[3:04:21] <%ThatRandomGuy661> You get a riven if you buy a quest frame prior to doing it
[3:04:21] <+OranHexthief> you can go to iron wake and buy the focus btw pat
[3:04:21] <aeonicvector> Since you had harrow, you get a free riven
[3:04:23] <zakti_prime> pat prob doesn't remember the end of war within

[3:04:38] <Zombrocom> A melee riven? That's the worst riven!
[3:04:41] <Crankthulhu> @Laecerelius Disagree, easy to stealth, when EVERYTHING IS TRAMPLED TO DEATH
[3:04:41] <AncelDeLambert> "We'll change absolutely nothing about our wretched ideology"
[3:04:41] <+Dasbubba> It's funny that she talks about taking in outcasts when the Red Veil's whole ideaology seems to be "Purge the things we don't deem pure."
[3:04:42] <+Grayhammatter> wow, already bought harrow? LUL
