[0:07:42] <chambatron> do you have to abide to the FTC even if you're in Canada? Is it because Twitch is a US company?

[0:30:10] <%MelBrooksKA> I feel blessed to have consumed product
[0:30:10] <holyxgrale> Yea you're sitting pretty for a minute
[0:30:16] <%Brassnarwhal> my understanding is that the shortage has very little to do with crypto this time

[0:30:36] <%Hamborgini> I'm still on a 1070, which makes it easy to save money on games since it can't run anything new
[0:30:38] <TIME_PUNCHER> when you think about it, babies are basically just tiny people
[0:30:39] <%SveriSageAdvice> i was able to get my 3060 because of Artesian Builds, i refuse to play the "shop around" game with these scalpers

[0:30:49] <+Carquar> Artesian rules. Super happy with my PC from them
[0:30:49] <AzureHawk_Streams> Cryptobros could do us all a favor and go explode their asses or something Kappa

[0:38:33] <RubberFistFight> @Valdorick In this case no it isn't. It's either an mRNA vaccine, or a vaccine containing isolated spike protein. No virus present at all. And "giving someone the vaccine when they're under" is absolutely NOT the "moral decision" since it violates the ethical codes medical practitioners swore to uphold, as well as being a cunt thing to do.

[0:46:28] <%Sotetsu> Pat likes his steak well done.
[0:46:30] <%KnightOfTrousers> Cheer500 Wait, so if the Holodeck 'deletes' jizz and crap, wouldn't that imply it's smart enough to 'detect' all that, and couldn't it be hacked to just...Delete a real person in an instant?
[0:46:35] <+sonofthedeepsouth> But why ?
[0:46:38] <ExpressNode> So I connected my DS4 controller to my PC with bluetooth and surprised its latency is good

[0:47:01] <livehardman> if holodeck deletes cum can you use it as a toilet also?
[0:47:02] <RubberFistFight> @KnightOfTrousers That was a plot point in a season 1 episode of TNG, but it was dropped because it was too clunky and difficult to make a recurring thing.
[0:47:08] <%Valdorick> @Valdorick Aw damn, I wasn't paying full attention during the episode, so all I heard was his *entire life* on that fucked time planet and that he had a son.

[0:50:19] <ammobasket> Folks still would want to go to new places, see new shit. Exploring the galaxy might be an excuse to get more holodeck data
[0:50:23] <cartakus> wow

[0:50:28] <%AncelDeLambert> SHE'S NOT READING THE CHAT
[0:50:28] <%oda_flobunaga> Our Man Bashir?
[0:50:28] <@QueequegTheater> @holyxgrale There's a reason Barkley kept fucking his bosses
[0:50:34] <%Valdorick> Can the Holodeck, with help from the replicator, create sperm that could make a child?
[0:50:34] <%AncelDeLambert> @AncelDeLambert he's awful
[0:50:35] <%Sotetsu> Is it Pat?
[0:50:37] <@PrefectusCorgi> She just Odo dick
[0:50:40] <%KnightOfTrousers> Could be someone who hates the holodeck secretly because they were addicted in the past, but had a relapse?
[0:50:41] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @Cozy90 maybe don't though
[0:50:42] <@goose_attack_almanac> I bet it's just fucking Sisco and baseball

[0:52:08] <%SaiyanShoto> *of
[0:52:13] <linSP> paige be communist!
[0:52:14] <@Ranryu692> and how awesome it isn't
[0:52:14] <churropoppa> based
[0:52:16] <%Mr_Pylon> And how much Kim rules
[0:52:17] <SaltyAzteca> Its funny cuz communism sucks
[0:52:17] <%Shonen_hero> Tankies woooo
[0:52:24] <+sonofthedeepsouth> BASED PAT
[0:52:26] <%NitronStreams> more like cummunism
[0:52:27] <%RealThiele> and she never did
[0:52:28] <%maskofmichael> Paige stream Disco maybe?
[0:52:29] <%Sterski> They're alright
[0:52:29] <+lumporr> communism - by the losers, of the losers, for the losers
[0:52:29] <Profmcstevie> Disco puts the ugly mirror in front of EVERYTHING it's very fun
[0:52:30] <%KnightOfTrousers> Shit he's right
[0:52:32] <@PrefectusCorgi> Da
[0:52:32] <@Ranryu692> that game telling to Woolie to get off the fence was fantastic
[0:52:32] <%baka_sugoi> COMMUNISUM
[0:52:34] <livehardman> popular streamer turns wife to communism and then bullies her fot it
[0:52:34] <%skrewarrior> communism is for speedrunners
[0:52:36] <RubberFistFight> DS9's version of the "holodiction" thing is, as per late DS9 tradition, much darker and more "raw" than the TNG version which was largely played for laughs.
[0:52:37] <@QueequegTheater> French accents are hotter
[0:52:38] <cartakus> Tip
[0:52:39] <%Shonen_hero> what's that, ethical, scientific communism? No, be crunched under my tank treads
[0:52:43] <+DrHentaiPhD> communism is awesome and also for losers. both statements are true
[0:52:49] <%dezik45> @PatStaresAt have you tried Vampire Survivors at all?

[1:22:05] <%Shonen_hero> God, I feel for poor Woolie. Dude was playing Everhood blind and wanted to wait for the game to present all options so he could decide a route, but in trying to avoid doing anything before making that decision was a branch that hard locked him into a route and forced him into a fight with the super boss.

[1:28:58] <spikeymike> Indie Animated Universe
[1:29:01] <Saltmeisterr> @ergulor i think he has the rune for it
[1:29:14] <%MrWurmles> The timer mechanic and trying to unlock all the unbetween doors, always irritated the heck out of me since they intro'ed bonus rooms in between stages.

[1:50:41] <lliam01> it was tact or surv, tact gives more health
[1:50:44] <heartlesshealer> I guess it gives you more max health, but ehhh
[1:50:44] <+CarlosEoM> there was no brut option
[1:50:44] <%shruke> there wasn't a brut option tbf
[1:50:45] <radicalApollo> Yes
[1:50:45] <%doc_ock_rokc> YES

[1:50:46] <+hephep_311> no brut option

[1:50:55] <BepBepAmShep> All stats give health with diminishing returns
[1:50:55] <heartlesshealer> Because it's a different one from what you picked yeah
[1:50:59] <@QueequegTheater> The meta has changed drastically since you played
[1:50:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> Do you now?
[1:50:59] <Manwad> yes, and also survival gives more hp

[1:51:01] <+Orcapugs> Spite
[1:51:03] <Saltmeisterr> pat right
[1:51:03] <%pectusumbra> correct! You get reduced returns the higher you go
[1:51:04] <%Valdorick> That guy FUCKS
[1:51:04] <@goose_attack_almanac> Green on average gives you more health. But they each give diminishing returns
[1:51:09] <~PatStaresAt> Captain Chicken @kingshadowcb, I need healing! Choose "heal", "potion", "life" or "noheal"
[1:51:10] <%WeLucklessJacks> Yes, but also Survival starts at a higher health value.
[1:51:11] <+puffinup> survival has the most health weight, but usually yeah the least gives you more hp
[1:51:12] <DianaTheAscian> he sucks hard
[1:51:16] <%za7az> @KingShadowCB heal him
[1:51:16] <%MrWurmles> The more you have of each element the less benefit from the next of that element.
[1:51:20] <%blastyoboots> the one you have the least of usually gives you more health, but Survival gives more health than other stats too.  Also sometimes we're given a choice of two stats not a choice of all three
