[0:13:01] <%UvBenServed> So that's where they went
[0:13:02] <Torgue_1> Is this content sponsored by Square Enix?
[0:13:04] <marvel877> I don't even want to see gameplay, I just want to listen to the dumb shit Pat's talking about.
[0:13:18] <bob900000> wooooo
[0:13:18] <%PigGuy800> i have never facepalmed so hard
[0:13:19] <%PaladinDupre> Cyberpunk kicked off the docket already eh?
[0:13:21] <MidnightSnack69> is that a mustard bottle in the background
[0:13:21] <%ThatMLPgamer> Cancel the stream go to bd
[0:13:23] <%ThatMLPgamer> bed

[0:13:59] <Torgue_1> That's a really weird clause
[0:14:06] <%honeyman18> Gross?
[0:14:07] <%MyNameIsRasus> japanossaurus
[0:14:22] <@SoFarFetched> just put on all your stream titles "#Sponsored by SquareEnix for FF7R"
[0:14:23] <bob900000> why?
[0:14:27] <@SoFarFetched> easy
[0:14:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The game itself was bizzare

[0:14:37] <%Aydarkzero> that's excessive
[0:14:53] <+michingmallecho> They want people to be honest.. hasKapp
[0:14:55] <%ayumimarin> excellent climate in the streaming community I see
[0:14:55] <%TheWinged7> that makes somewhat sense if it was a cut down video, but not a stream
[0:14:56] <%adzy2k6> Don't a lot of the boss fights last longer than 15 mins?
[0:14:56] <%BubbaRands> But what if we forget?
[0:14:58] <Zeikier> oh no! does Pat's is the pirates????
[0:14:59] <watts121> Make sure you suck the dick that's feeding you!
[0:15:00] <@SoFarFetched> or when dumb shit is happening "Sponsored by square enix"
[0:15:01] <%honeyman18> That sounds fun to deal with
[0:15:02] <+EySoyCoco> the subreddit is in flames, and that sounds hyperbolic as usual buuut its true
[0:15:03] <ISKMogul> FTC weirdness is really screwy, but that's too much
[0:15:10] <%UvBenServed> Just have a giant watermark constantly on screen that says #Sponsored

[0:15:28] <@SoFarFetched> Paige eating spoonfuls of sugar on stream? Sponsored by Square Enix

[0:38:01] <%adzy2k6> Might be stream settings? There is definitely a notch or two over saturation
[0:38:03] <%coreyyotto> Like it's the same oversaturation that Demon's Souls had

[0:41:51] <$watchmanfury> is that audio wobble normal for the song?
[0:41:56] <Mangahero18> From now on all bugs and technical issues are to be referred to as 'getting cyberpunked'.
[0:41:57] <%ThatMLPgamer> @TallGuyWithAHoodie More like what are the odds he plays the first level and breaks down into anxiety tears over the performance?
[0:42:09] <ToneBacas> @watchmanfury might be twitch doing its thing
[0:42:16] <%TalisKanju> Eldin Ring was announced last year, Bayonetta 3 was announced in 2017 though

[0:52:50] <+polothegreatest> Destroyer of continuity
[0:52:51] <ToneBacas> @OhioNitsud it sure looks like one from the gameplay i saw
[0:52:52] <%TigerCatGo> Haven't finished the game myself and as much as I love Egg Boi, I WANT HIM TO FAIL.
[0:52:52] <%BigCoffee> Pat, to be fair, ocarina of time listterally splits into 3 damn timelines. This is par for the franchise

[0:54:10] <AoiRob> half the zelda games aren't canon who cares
[0:54:11] <dinnydanny777> There isn't a character who could narrate it
[0:54:12] <$Artoo_The_Me> I like how everyone has a problem with time travel but ocarina has time travel
[0:54:13] <RyuuAoi> Pat, don't spoil us on Monday now!

[0:54:37] <dinnydanny777> @nobrev No but the canon, which is ruined, ruined in the same way every single Zelda game ruins the canon LUL
[0:54:37] <%Ipsenscastle> Tim seals himself in a vacuum tent to give himself spoiler avoiding powers

[0:54:37] <peachy996> I am triple HHH
[0:54:37] <%linSP> Zelda had time travel since oot
[0:54:38] <Mangahero18> Remember that the Sheikah tribe are servants of the Goddess Hylia, who created the 'Gates of Time' from both Skyward Sword and the original Hyrule Warriors. Time Travel is a SUPER common theme in LoZ.
[0:54:43] <+RootVeggie> How are people upset at time travel in a series mostly about time travel and diverging timelines?
[0:54:47] <%superc37> spoilers theres a zelda
[0:54:48] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> on the one hand, I am sad that we didn't get the canon everyone dies ending. on the other hand, it makes a better story
[0:54:51] <+loukemia83> Defier of Prophecy is a dope ass title
[0:54:54] <dinnydanny777> So this is Brock from Pokemon LUL
[0:54:54] <mattynezz> Caring about spoilers is dumb and makes you dumb

[0:54:55] <%rumtumtugnutz> this whole game is like the last day before the end of the world.
[0:55:01] <%TigerCatGo> The English VAs in this and BotW are ROUGH, IMO...
[0:55:03] <%SvenHolgersson> GOLBINS psaGib
[0:55:04] <SomersaultJustice> spoilers, swords

[0:55:55] <%AlteisenReiseZ> PAT STARES AT: FRAMES
[0:55:56] <AMUSERNAME> I'm a little weirded out that the art style seems so already-ruined. Not much about this looks very pre-Calamity??
[0:55:57] <%ThatMLPgamer> remember the first level is the worst performance wise
[0:55:58] <SaltyAzteca> FUCK EM UP
[0:56:00] <%AzureGale> If it doesn't crash is will still be a better-performing game
[0:56:01] <%kewlmyc> PRAY FOR SWITCH PRO
[0:56:01] <%medusasghost> just wrecking them
[0:56:03] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt the framerate gets better after the second mission
[0:56:03] <CursedNobleman> CHUG CHUG CHUG
[0:56:04] <SolsticeZro> FPS drops are part of balancing the difficulty Kappa
[0:56:04] <+DarkNerdShawny> you should play with the pc emulator for 60fps
[0:56:05] <%solracc25> Pat must slay the mind goblins
[0:56:07] <Saltmeisterr> ENJOY THE POWERPOINT PAT
[0:56:08] <Portal_Operater> Is the framerate better in this than the demo?
[0:56:08] <RyuuAoi> Maybe just a shorted BOTW instead of a Moosow?
[0:56:08] <%GG_sensay> at least it's less glitchy
[0:56:08] <dinnydanny777> Whack
[0:56:10] <%Blackleafx> @TallGuyWithAHoodie whyd pat say people thought this was spoilers then? isnt it a prequel?
[0:56:13] <%skizzuto> this mission is particularly bad, framerate-wise
[0:56:15] <AoiRob> once you tune out the framerate the game is a blast
[0:56:20] <SGrim> Is this a Musou game?
[0:56:21] <%Aydarkzero> i really wish this was just a regular zelda game
[0:56:22] <%TheHappyCynic> is this the same engine as BOTW?
[0:56:23] <%Nobrev> the crust in this game doesnt bother me too much personally but yeah it gets chunky often
[0:56:24] <RuffleDOG> Oh stop it pat, you knew what you were getting yourself into
[0:56:25] <TopTierHarley> light heavy is launcher
[0:56:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> Imagine if your sword breaked in this one

[0:56:35] <Calek> it's not
[0:56:37] <seaechiowai> is Lubu here yet

[0:56:41] <+TheotherKristian> K.O. = Killed Ogres
[0:56:42] <%GG_sensay> definitely not

[0:56:51] <%TigerCatGo> "TURN OFF THE MATH?????" LUL LUL
[0:56:52] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> @blackleafx it was supposed to be a prequel, the whole dream match wasn't in the trailers.
[0:56:52] <RyuuAoi> I does look like it. No free roam.
[0:56:53] <%RealThiele> i think tis DW engine with botw assets
[0:56:54] <%delilah4you> delilah4you subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! Whatup you big ginger nerd, keep on keeping on.
[0:56:55] <mattynezz> Every character has a gimmick, Link has his bow, and gets his double Heavy thing.
[0:56:55] <dinnydanny777> Botw didn't have anywhere near this amount of shit happening

[0:57:16] <+loukemia83> Link Air Combos!
[0:57:17] <%Daniel_Is_I> You can also shoot bow while in the air
[0:57:21] <Mangahero18> That was a pretty anemic spin attack.
[0:57:25] <SGrim> Okay, so we got a Musou game, but instead a Liu Bu, we pursue lubed fish puss? PogChamp
[0:57:26] <@Mechz71> Play on stream once

[0:57:34] <%Agami23> so you'll never play it again?
[0:57:34] <TopTierHarley> This needs a better Switch
[0:57:35] <ToneBacas> just like CP2077
[0:57:36] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Pat is Psyduck
[0:57:37] <%rumtumtugnutz> So like March
[0:57:39] <+charlie2089> yup
[0:57:39] <CursedNobleman> @SGrim PogChamp
[0:57:40] <TopTierHarley> it's not powerful enough

[0:58:00] <Maleicus> @rekinom it literally is dynasty warriors
[0:58:01] <%Blackleafx> Is he surfing on his shield?
[0:58:01] <%MyNameIsRasus> ngl armor link looks fresh
[0:58:05] <ToneBacas> @WorldsBestPanda when all the DLC is out I guess. Maybe not even then
[0:58:06] <SolsticeZro> add a speen to the speen to ween
[0:58:11] <CursedNobleman> well, if youre a fan of castlesuperbeast youre either into amazongs or monstergirls. so BOTW has something for all of us LUL

[0:58:16] <TallGuyWithAHoodie> as a musou game this one has a lot more moveset variety than a lot of others
[0:58:18] <bahble> emualte now
[0:58:19] <%tank7013> That mechanic is unique to Link btw
[0:58:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> there's definitely going to be a Switch Pro.
[0:58:26] <Saltmeisterr> BUT PAT THATS ILLEGAL :O
[0:58:26] <%juxtest> 200 Kos or some say 200 Kosm
[0:58:28] <bahble> IT ALREADY RUNS AT 4K 30 ON PC
[0:58:28] <%PanicSwytch> Why couldn't I do those combos in Botw LUL
[0:58:31] <+clockworkblues> lol
[0:58:31] <RyuuAoi> Low key want Link To The Past Overworld theme playing rn. Nintendo with the missed opportunity.
[0:58:32] <+DarkNerdShawny> the emulator for it is great!
[0:58:32] <dinnydanny777> Yeah
[0:58:33] <bahble> YES
[0:58:33] <%RealThiele> Mipha god why you gotta make me question myself
[0:58:34] <AoiRob> the soundtrack bangs
[0:58:34] <+Samsquanch> emulate it now. runs better on yuzu lol
[0:58:35] <SomersaultJustice> #LuBu4Smash
[0:58:36] <%Agami23> there IS a switch emulator
[0:58:38] <+DarkNerdShawny> yeah
[0:58:38] <+WorldsBestPanda> NO, ILLEGAL, BAD, NO
[0:58:40] <majindusto> The Rumors of a Switch Pro are SO STUPID lol
[0:58:40] <+polothegreatest> no big combos, grind first
[0:58:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> Well yeah
[0:58:45] <AoiRob> it emulates badly. but it does
[0:58:47] <LoneFonte> oh yeah, how's that switch emulator going?
[0:58:49] <dinnydanny777> Good dodges LUL
[0:58:51] <+DarkNerdShawny> theres 2 switch emulators
[0:58:54] <RyuuAoi> Don't! Pat will cut this shit short real quick!
[0:58:55] <%Valdorick> DOOOOOODGE
[0:58:55] <CursedNobleman> the sad thing is that the combat in this game might be more interesting than botw LUL
[0:58:56] <Mangahero18> Yea you can totally emulate Switch games. Its pretty decent so far.
[0:58:57] <GigaSeifer> nintendo consoles have always been really easy to crack emulation for
[0:58:57] <%Valdorick> ...or block
[0:58:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's not illegal if you own the game\
[0:58:59] <+Caidezes> It sucks emulated.
[0:59:03] <+Delenay> flurry rush him
[0:59:15] <SomersaultJustice> ganon defeated
[0:59:20] <Zayasu> i still thinks that emulator needs a few months
[0:59:21] <+ZeldaAssassiin> yep
[0:59:21] <dinnydanny777> Yes
[0:59:23] <bahble> I saw it running real well
[0:59:24] <LoneFonte> yep
[0:59:24] <Saltmeisterr> Ye
[0:59:24] <The_Maddness> YES
[0:59:26] <SomersaultJustice> yes
[0:59:27] <redrins> man musou games really are comfort food, this seems fun even if it has a bad framerate
[0:59:27] <%RealThiele> yes perfect dodge to flurry
[0:59:27] <%FackuIkari> ye
[0:59:28] <%thedankestmeeme> Knocked out pat not dead
[0:59:30] <Bigyanno> What is it about Nintendo that their consoles are so much easier to emulate than other companies?
[0:59:31] <+DarkNerdShawny> it doesn't suck emulated. if who ever says that they pc is trash
[0:59:32] <%Valdorick> Perfect Parry is too
[0:59:33] <ToneBacas> i fucking hate that it came down to this form of thinking, where we look at games today and say they'll be amazing in the future when the updated version is out or when emulation can just pump that framerate
[0:59:33] <%skizzuto> yes, but the timing window is much tighter than BotW
[0:59:35] <Mangahero18> If you try and emulate this game though, nintendo will come to your house and BREAK YOUR FUCKING KNEES.
[0:59:36] <Saltmeisterr> althought its more strict
[0:59:38] <+ZeldaAssassiin> the timing is tough though
[0:59:38] <bahble> Ryujinx runs it well I think
[0:59:42] <%adzy2k6> Guessing that modern x86 processors can't emulate the switch processors and GPU well enough
[0:59:45] <%bevyrage> hey pat, do me a favor and next time you fight one of those horned guys shoot an arrow at their horn please? i wanna know if they brought that interaction back with this game.
[0:59:50] <mattynezz> Ye
[0:59:52] <%barrakuta371> Nintendo Switch Pro with DLSS can't come soon enough. This framerate nyannScary
[0:59:57] <%RealThiele> LUL
[0:59:59] <%Aydarkzero> do the cool thing
[0:59:59] <%tank7013> Timing seems tighter in this one
[1:00:00] <SomersaultJustice> it's really tight
[1:00:03] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt its a lot more strict
[1:00:07] <valriot> Honestly, people are better off buying the first game. Its both cheaper/runs well/has too much content
[1:00:08] <%Daxalog> Character can do it easier than others
[1:00:08] <+Delenay> late
[1:00:09] <+Samsquanch> you can play astral chain at 60fps if you have a psycho pc
[1:00:10] <+ZeldaAssassiin> pretty late
[1:00:11] <dinnydanny777> Late :)
[1:00:13] <%thedankestmeeme> too early
[1:00:13] <+charp35> I wish this game ran better the frame rate is awful
[1:00:14] <SomersaultJustice> really late
[1:00:14] <%skizzuto> it's a very tight window
[1:00:16] <%FackuIkari> very late
[1:00:18] <%YaBoiShamoi> PIXIL PERFECT
[1:00:20] <RyuuAoi> That fucking Horse man better be hard to beat.
[1:00:21] <redrins> do it just frame Kappa
[1:00:27] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:00:27] <%RealThiele> there is a stat to open the window
[1:00:28] <SolsticeZro> is it not a lock on dodge to left/right?
[1:00:28] <auraofdawn> its timing is really fucky, i rarely got it in the demo
[1:00:29] <%GG_sensay> dashing INTO the attack helps a little
[1:00:31] <+WorldsBestPanda> Just do it.
[1:00:32] <%Valdorick> Its justframe.
[1:00:32] <%bevyrage> probably you need to be pretty much getting hit i'd assume
[1:00:33] <+ZeldaAssassiin> this guy isn't the best to practice it on
[1:00:34] <dinnydanny777> Some attacks are easier to dodge into it than others
[1:00:36] <%Nobrev> its pretty close to just frame
[1:00:38] <+paladinstarbuster> musou ai isn't aggressive till you want it to be
[1:00:38] <AoiRob> like 10 frames before impact
[1:00:42] <CursedNobleman> is age of calamity the dark souls of musou games? PogChamp
[1:00:42] <%PanicSwytch> To early
[1:00:44] <RyuuAoi> No witch time
[1:00:44] <ToneBacas> @adzy2k6 problem is, emulation has to emulate the whole system, not just translate the instructions
[1:00:46] <+TheotherKristian> Dont be so close?
[1:00:47] <%Ipsenscastle> this game looks like it's falling apart as we play it
[1:00:47] <prhymes321> lock on first
[1:00:47] <mattynezz> Protip: Aim the bow at their heads, it opens up their weak point gauge
[1:00:52] <bleugh> he's pretty passive
[1:00:56] <SomersaultJustice> try it on a moblin
[1:00:56] <%SharkMissile> It'll just happen all the time by accident
[1:00:58] <seaechiowai> doesn't seem to me like it's worth the effort
[1:01:00] <majindusto> COWARD
[1:01:00] <%Valdorick> Look at that Hero Spearman!
[1:01:01] <%tank7013> The timing is tight but on the plus side the direction you dodge doesn't matter anymore
[1:01:02] <%Nobrev> its easier with swipes rather than stabs
[1:01:06] <peachy996> This is how the war is won
[1:01:08] <Saltmeisterr> OHH
[1:01:09] <mattynezz> Git gud
[1:01:10] <%Valdorick> A Staunch line of spears!
[1:01:11] <%RealThiele> gear with + perfect dodge window is nice
[1:01:12] <Saltmeisterr> thats why
[1:01:12] <majindusto> THERE WE GO
[1:01:12] <RyuuAoi> Oh nice
[1:01:14] <ToneBacas> @adzy2k6 that includes the guest filesystem, input/output devices, firmware, etc
[1:01:14] <%MyNameIsRasus> WOW FRAMES
[1:01:15] <Idon__> oh god the frames
[1:01:17] <MackFighters> Pogchamp
[1:01:18] <robotman37> Yeyeye go random soldier
[1:01:19] <+emVulpine> I figured.
[1:01:20] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:01:24] <atomizer_> built-in input lag
[1:01:24] <+loukemia83> Look at all these GUTS
[1:01:27] <Forester_Skippy> its harder than botw because frames
[1:01:27] <Idon__> Don't worry Pat, it gets worse.
[1:01:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> BURSTING AT THE SEAMS
[1:01:32] <SolsticeZro> frame by frame melting into butter
[1:01:33] <%TigerCatGo> Yeah, BUT IT'S FUN
[1:01:33] <%Broand> Dare you to try it on the handheld
[1:01:36] <majindusto> "MELTING"
[1:01:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> can we go back to yakuzies
[1:01:40] <%Valdorick> ... Then again, has ANY Muso game EVER run at good frames?
[1:01:40] <%adzy2k6> @ToneBacas I've written a couple of minor emulators :) Just saying that the limiting factor will usually be the graphics and CPU emulation, in terms of speed
[1:01:40] <Saltmeisterr> EGG
[1:01:41] <%MyNameIsRasus> built it normal lag too
[1:01:42] <CursedNobleman> EGG
[1:01:42] <RyuuAoi> Only in hand held, Pat. Come on!
[1:01:42] <%TigerCatGo> EGG BOI
[1:01:43] <%Blackleafx> EGG
[1:01:44] <+paladinstarbuster> is so glad I can't tell
[1:01:45] <%Aydarkzero> tut complete
[1:01:46] <bleugh> who needs frames anyway
[1:01:47] <$Artoo_The_Me> Headshots still work
[1:01:48] <%RealThiele> now play couch coop with paige and watch it catch fire
[1:01:51] <%Ipsenscastle> i feel like my laptop is fucking up just watching it
[1:01:52] <Mangahero18> I would be surpised if this game is getting 50 FPS even in cutscenes. Max.
[1:01:53] <Saltmeisterr> IMPA
[1:01:53] <%Valdorick> I thought the entire point of a Muso Game was to melt your console's graphic gard.
[1:01:53] <auraofdawn> egg babey is here
[1:01:53] <SomersaultJustice> with impa, you can drop the framerate to like 2 fps
[1:01:54] <%ThatMLPgamer> god hes so cute

[1:02:01] <seaechiowai> @doc_ock_rokc it's next week
[1:02:04] <+AgiSkills> the unstable frame rate is a feature
[1:02:05] <valriot> Its bizarre, cos both BOTW and the first Warriors run well
[1:02:06] <%SharkMissile> Impa is an absolute beast in this game
[1:02:07] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt items auto collect so you can ignore chests that spawn from enemies. hidden chest on the level are manual tho
[1:02:11] <%TigerCatGo> THAT'S HER, IN ENGLISH???
[1:02:12] <SomersaultJustice> young impa's great
[1:02:12] <%FackuIkari> Wait till you get the second character and start doind special attacks

[1:02:28] <%TigerCatGo> I'm playing in Russian. Sounds more "Hylian" to me
[1:02:35] <Bigyanno> Why does pat have a blanket on him like he just got rescued from a bad mans basement by a SWAT team?
[1:02:38] <%FackuIkari> Impa kills this game
[1:02:40] <%RealThiele> expand dong
[1:02:46] <%TheHappyCynic> their faces look so dead when they talk
[1:02:47] <+paladinstarbuster> HOW?

[1:02:52] <%Daxalog> Zangief HATES the ruined canon
[1:02:53] <RyuuAoi> Can you even climb it??
[1:02:57] <dinnydanny777> @valriot Warriors 1 doesn't have as many enemies on screen, it also does trickery to hide enemies in the distance which this game seems like it doesn't want to do
[1:02:58] <redrins> tenga egg

[1:03:44] <SomersaultJustice> you can turn gyro off

[1:03:59] <+Delenay> yup
[1:04:00] <CursedNobleman> yes
[1:04:00] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[1:04:01] <+ZeldaAssassiin> correct
[1:04:02] <The_Maddness> Everyone has a different version of the Ipad moves btw
[1:04:03] <%tank7013> Ye
[1:04:03] <$spardanwarrior> yes
[1:04:03] <mattynezz> R, not ZR
[1:04:04] <kersmushh> well, for some things
[1:04:06] <RyuuAoi> Oh fuck this is the same fucking game just less features.
[1:04:06] <AoiRob> ye
[1:04:08] <marvel877> yes
[1:04:08] <%Valdorick> Yeah
[1:04:10] <LoneFonte> @PatStaresAt yep, everyone has some stuff
[1:04:11] <+hornydino_> wasn't the first 3D Zelda game a time travel game
[1:04:12] <kersmushh> stasis is almost always the same
[1:04:13] <MattoBii> yep, same four powers, but wildly different applications
[1:04:13] <RyuuAoi> I use mine for porn
[1:04:14] <%TheHappyCynic> psaUp

[1:04:20] <%AzureGale> Whats with the magic bags
[1:04:23] <CursedNobleman> @RyuuAoi same game of what? LUL
[1:04:25] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you can turn the motion off in settings
[1:04:26] <SomersaultJustice> you get the same 4 basic types, but the attack is different
[1:04:26] <dinnydanny777> @valriot No, it's a valid point, Hyrule Warriors 1 hides enemies from the player, seemingly for performance reason, it seems like this game doesn't do that
[1:04:28] <+Delenay> i like the way they use it in this game over botw
[1:04:30] <+taggerung403> man link got super weak after his 100 year nap
[1:04:30] <mattynezz> Yup
[1:04:35] <%RealThiele> just look down while you run ez
[1:04:38] <Saltmeisterr> while i do like motion aiming, in this it sucks ass
[1:04:38] <+CptBritches> If the game had no enemies it would run better, yes
[1:04:46] <%tank7013> This game's gyro is really bad
[1:04:47] <majindusto> It's So nice when a Zelda game actually Has MUSIC!!!!
[1:04:53] <Monkeyweed21> it runs much better undocked
[1:04:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> @RyuuAoi It's a Dynasty Warriors game, it's a completely different ending than BOTW.
[1:05:02] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> All the other soldiers are all like "Hey, i never got a glider doodSad doodSad doodSad "
[1:05:04] <RyuuAoi> Absolutely not, Pat. A little rough, but not the worst we have seen.

[1:05:25] <%TigerCatGo> Paige is QUEEN OF THE LIZARDS
[1:05:28] <%TheHappyCynic> if it runs better in handheld mode that still means it runs like shit
[1:05:29] <Mr_Strut> Was this at the furry cons?
[1:05:30] <mattynezz> In most missions there aren't that many enemies
[1:05:31] <%iosephe> lol
[1:05:31] <RyuuAoi> @rumtumtugnutz Yeah it's a prequel. I hope it doesn't end the same.

[1:06:24] <%cvp5127> too op
[1:06:26] <Bigyanno> Has anyone ever seen Paige lick her eyeballs? I'm worried that they are drying out
[1:06:27] <%MyNameIsRasus> WHY WAS SHE RUNNING

[1:06:30] <+loukemia83> Oh shit she does Jutsus
[1:06:30] <%TigerCatGo> GET STANDS
[1:06:33] <%MyNameIsRasus> IF SHE'S THIS STRONG
[1:06:34] <%moogleboy1984> I wasn't even aware Pat had a Switch
[1:06:34] <%rkbinder> Pat needs his safety blanket
[1:06:35] <+Delenay> kill the one in blue
[1:06:36] <kersmushh> *hold* x
[1:06:36] <mattynezz> @TrollKing96 It's called Dynasty Warriors Empires
[1:06:36] <auraofdawn> she's so much cooler than link
[1:06:38] <%ssjklyco> She makes Doppleganger
[1:06:40] <%RealThiele> FRAMU ANNIHILATION
[1:06:41] <RyuuAoi> Oh shit! Style switching?!
[1:06:42] <%TheHappyCynic> if she's such a badass why was she having trouble earlier
[1:06:43] <%adzy2k6> Wait, so is this what happens if link didn't sleep for like 100 years?
[1:06:47] <%Jaller101514> Impa is weird but OP once you figure her out
[1:06:47] <AoiRob> shadow clone jutsu
[1:06:48] <Phrickshun> put symbols on monsters and absorb to give yourself doppplegangers
[1:06:49] <Idon__> Impa legit kills this game's framerate even harder
[1:06:51] <%HodouVAN> you plant symbols on enemies and then absorb them with X attacks. then when you have 3 symbols it powers up all your moves.
[1:06:52] <%KineKithZen> OK so she's less DRK more NIN this game. Still a downgrade
[1:06:53] <CursedNobleman> best moveset, worst english VA LUL
[1:06:54] <SolsticeZro> oh shit mirror images
[1:06:54] <SomersaultJustice> press X on a character with symbols to get standos
[1:06:55] <+paladinstarbuster> Yooo
[1:06:56] <Saltmeisterr> she gets clones
[1:06:59] <%Maruko19> Impa is so dope in this game
[1:06:59] <auraofdawn> she just gets like 5 doppelgangers, its fine
[1:06:59] <%Valdorick> ITS JUST LIKE MY NA-RU-TO
[1:07:00] <simifu> @moogleboy1984 really? then how did he play DP2?
[1:07:00] <MattoBii> impa's the best character, she's so broken
[1:07:02] <kersmushh> yeah she's op af
[1:07:02] <valriot> YE CLONE JUTSU
[1:07:02] <%Zeif00> As if the game didn't have enough models LUL
[1:07:03] <Forester_Skippy> generate symbol destroys the framerate
[1:07:04] <+CptBritches> Impa don't fuck around
[1:07:05] <%Toynota10> press ZR to put a symbol on an enemy, then you absorb with a combo that ends with X
[1:07:05] <%TigerCatGo> FO. REAL.
[1:07:07] <SomersaultJustice> impa's the best
[1:07:09] <+polothegreatest> 3 symbols more clones
[1:07:10] <RyuuAoi> BAD BITCHES ONLY
[1:07:10] <+pectusumbra> cool ninja stuff
[1:07:11] <%TheHappyCynic> fuck she got doppelganger
[1:07:12] <%MyNameIsRasus> HOW DID THESE PEOPLE LOSE
[1:07:12] <%GG_sensay> impa is absolutely OP
[1:07:13] <dinnydanny777> Use a bomb for the 10/10 Voice acting LUL
[1:07:14] <peachy996> beliebe it
[1:07:17] <seaechiowai> suddenly doppleganger
[1:07:17] <%brachydios777> That’s pretty broken
[1:07:18] <marvel877> And that's why the FPS drops
[1:07:18] <%TigerCatGo> Her and Revali are SO BROKEN, IT'S TOO GOOD
[1:07:19] <%RealThiele> VO :(
[1:07:19] <CursedNobleman> STEaL yOUrseLf
[1:07:20] <$zackalan> Shadow Clone Waifu Jutsu
[1:07:21] <iceballstwitch> fun fact: you can't play as Edna Mode in this game
[1:07:22] <+OhioNitsud> is she doing judgement cuts? PogChamp
[1:07:22] <%AzureGale> MAXIMUM IMPA

[1:07:27] <majindusto> Impa has Shadow Clones scottfGasp
[1:07:28] <peachy996> Very Taki esqu finisher
[1:07:29] <+Delenay> i hope you like hearing "steel yourself"
[1:07:30] <%Zeif00> yo that was cool
[1:07:34] <RyuuAoi> Where's that fish bitch that loves Link?
[1:07:36] <WeebFever> ITSTIME
[1:07:39] <+Delenay> its just botw but faster
[1:07:41] <vonmaultke> She's a Naruto rip off LUL Somebody call WOOLIE
[1:07:45] <%Bailey__gaming> she even does the hand symbol from Naruto
[1:07:48] <%RealThiele> over ambitious and fun but chug
[1:07:48] <+paladinstarbuster> itsfine
[1:07:51] <SCIENCE_25> She Naruto runs LUL
[1:07:53] <CursedNobleman> KATON. GOKAKYU NO JUTSU LUL
[1:07:53] <Idon__> Why would you make a character like this in a game that runs this bad
[1:07:54] <KingVantq> Imagine if it was a switch game
[1:07:57] <KingVantq> wasnt
[1:08:00] <+It_sjustjoey> Music kinda slaps
[1:08:01] <$spardanwarrior> Rods and apples are consumables btw
[1:08:02] <peachy996> Call Woolie? I'm sure he's already aware
[1:08:02] <%AlteisenReiseZ> DEATH BLOSSOM
[1:08:03] <%RealThiele> she also does frogs
[1:08:03] <%Valdorick> AIR BOMBING
[1:08:04] <marvel877> Pat, you've played worse running games, don't complain.
[1:08:04] <+queaks> @vonmaultke An what is naruto based on?
[1:08:05] <%KineKithZen> Well she's absolutely broken
[1:08:06] <Phrickshun> That's like asking for good framerate in an EDF game LUL
[1:08:09] <SomersaultJustice> YYX is amazing
[1:08:10] <+CptBritches> This game incorporates the mechanics of the actual Zelda game way more than the first Hyrule Warriors did. It's pretty interesting
[1:08:11] <The_Maddness> Its BotW if BotW was also Bayonetta and also Musou
[1:08:12] <AoiRob> she's a naruto
[1:08:14] <+RootVeggie> it's honestly pretty inoffensive
[1:08:14] <kersmushh> your seals run out, fyi
[1:08:14] <+loukemia83> Impa has always been awesome
[1:08:14] <MattoBii> most levels run okayyyy? there are some severe drops if a bunch of shit happens on screen
[1:08:17] <RyuuAoi> DLC for sure
[1:08:19] <%BubbaRands> When will she activate her Kekkei Genkai
[1:08:19] <%Aydarkzero> dude she has like the best moveset already
[1:08:20] <%AzureGale> Will Impa be Woolie's favorite character
[1:08:21] <%RealThiele> every character is fun like this imo
[1:08:25] <SolsticeZro> sheikah skeelz
[1:08:26] <+ZeldaAssassiin> try the ipad
[1:08:26] <RyuuAoi> BAYO for DLC
[1:08:34] <%codedoomboy> Try her bombs
[1:08:34] <simifu> I don't know weather to blame switch or koeitechmo
[1:08:35] <majindusto> I see the Pat wil bitch about the Framerate nonstop scottfScream
[1:08:35] <+RootVeggie> Impa is actually like the best character
[1:08:35] <+queaks> @PatStaresAt Collect symbols first pat
[1:08:36] <+CptBritches> This game does enough different stuff that I can deal with the frame problems.
[1:08:38] <+CookieCutter007> is she Hit
[1:08:40] <mattynezz> Mark enemies with ZR, then hit them with a heavy attack to make clones
[1:08:40] <%MyNameIsRasus> Running okay means stable 30
[1:08:43] <kersmushh> @PatStaresAt hold x
[1:08:44] <%ThatMLPgamer> @AzureGale Shes not the OG hyrule warriors verson so no
[1:08:44] <CursedNobleman> OG hyrule warriors impa was better LUL
[1:08:45] <Saltmeisterr> characters are WAY more unique in this than og hyrule warriors
[1:08:47] <%TheHappyCynic> impa for shinobi strikers
[1:08:48] <%Garthunox> @AzureGale Urbossa exists
[1:08:50] <+polothegreatest> mipha is easy mode
[1:08:51] <%RealThiele> heavy attack or murder to absorb
[1:08:51] <+ZeldaAssassiin> ZR -> X -> X
[1:08:51] <Veluren> @PatStaresAt If any X attack hits a marked enemy it absorbs it
[1:08:52] <%CapnClassix> You can just mark them and kill them normally
[1:08:53] <london_flexing> @patstaresat Which Battlestar G did you watch and would recommend? 1978 or 2004?
[1:08:54] <Forester_Skippy> you absorb symbols with any strogn attack even in combos
[1:08:55] <%PadreHail> Impa is quite literally the most broken Musou character I've ever played
[1:08:56] <SomersaultJustice> put the symbol, then use an attack string that ends in X
[1:08:57] <MattoBii> kill the marked enemy with X to nab the symbol
[1:08:57] <+abrupt_abe> That's it
[1:08:57] <%Valdorick> Mark them, then use strong attack for clones
[1:08:57] <Phrickshun> any heavy attacks will absorb symbols up to a maximum of 3
[1:09:00] <+Delenay> kill the one you blued. your quick kill doesnt always target them tho
[1:09:03] <vonmaultke> @queaks some fucked up kabuki theater about terrorists and the authors edge LUL
[1:09:03] <duel_pro> look at the movelist for explanations about each character
[1:09:06] <auraofdawn> casually judgment cuts everything
[1:09:06] <%Bmrandfriends> that girl is THICK
[1:09:06] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt strong attacks absorbs symbols
[1:09:07] <%GG_sensay> yes
[1:09:07] <+NoCreditClear> gotta suck up symbol with a heavy attack
[1:09:08] <+Beniial> Eww, why is link in this game
[1:09:08] <LoneFonte> absolutely
[1:09:08] <%RealThiele> one of them
[1:09:09] <SomersaultJustice> yes
[1:09:09] <%Valdorick> Yes
[1:09:10] <%tank7013> You can also just kill them to get symbol. More symbol means more shadow clone
[1:09:10] <dinnydanny777> No LUL
[1:09:10] <pixelkenj> Your strong combos also absorb glyphs
[1:09:12] <MattoBii> absolutely
[1:09:12] <%averyoddjew> yeah kinda
[1:09:12] <Monkeyweed21> YUP
[1:09:14] <simifu> No that goes to SPOILER
[1:09:14] <marvel877> kinda, yeah
[1:09:14] <%barrakuta371> Impa, Destroyer of FPS
[1:09:15] <%PadreHail> She is fucking absurdly strong
[1:09:16] <Forester_Skippy> i craashed my game twice as her when i really tried to kill the game
[1:09:18] <Saltmeisterr> no
[1:09:18] <%brachydios777> Ye
[1:09:19] <%Zeif00> One of several
[1:09:19] <%Aydarkzero> looks like it
[1:09:20] <mattynezz> Any heavy attack
[1:09:20] <%ssjklyco> You tag them, kill the guys with the tags to obsorb, and it makes you clones
[1:09:20] <+paladinstarbuster> frame rate what framerate
[1:09:21] <%AzureGale> @Garthunox Damn I forgot about Urbossa
[1:09:21] <+CptBritches> Eh, there's a lot of frame rate destroyers in this game
[1:09:23] <dinnydanny777> She isn't THE framerate destroyer LUL
[1:09:26] <%Nobrev> @PatStaresAt you absorb a symbol when you hit a guy that you mark with one of your strong attack combo finishers. it doesnt just have to be the first one
[1:09:28] <Saltmeisterr> not ganon
[1:09:29] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt mark enemieswith zr, then kill with X attacks to summon clones and annhilite the frames
[1:09:29] <SCIENCE_25> No it's SPOILER
[1:09:31] <iceballstwitch> once you get a bit into the game and have big combos, everyone becomes the framerate killers
[1:09:33] <Saltmeisterr> its birb
[1:09:33] <mattynezz> YYX is a good one to do it with
[1:09:36] <%tank7013> Mipha can fuck it up PRETTY bad
[1:09:37] <RyuuAoi> SPOIL ME
[1:09:42] <%Zeif00> OG HW Ganon is the best one
[1:09:46] <rosemon5001> yes all of the frames went to her ass @PatStaresAt
[1:09:46] <%TheHappyCynic> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand
[1:09:47] <%Valdorick> Lu Bu Ganon was the BEST
[1:09:52] <RyuuAoi> Pat like
[1:09:56] <pixelkenj> except for the motion control feels
[1:09:56] <%PadreHail> Urbosa has a fucking LIGHTNING MAX ACT
[1:10:00] <SomersaultJustice> hit the big red barrel Kappa
[1:10:04] <valriot> VERY GOOD
[1:10:05] <%superc37> dude who the fuck cares about spoilers for this game
[1:10:07] <marvel877> We just REALLY need a new Switch.
[1:10:08] <%Bailey__gaming> can I play as princess ruto
[1:10:08] <SchroedingersFerret> It goes to Lube bu
[1:10:08] <Saltmeisterr> i hear strikers is good
[1:10:09] <%averyoddjew> it's a good dynasty warriors game
[1:10:09] <redrins> persona musou, there Kappa
[1:10:09] <%RealThiele> wife and i still have tons of fun even with 10-15 FPS
[1:10:11] <%AlteisenReiseZ> Hyrule Warriors Ganon is an ACE design
[1:10:11] <%Garthunox> looks fun
[1:10:12] <%MyNameIsRasus> It's like this but mixed with Persona
[1:10:12] <%Daniel_Is_I> I've heard good
[1:10:12] <mattynezz> Urbosa is really good, and really simple
[1:10:13] <%cvp5127> the demo was fun
[1:10:16] <BlueLunecy> It's a musou with depth apparently
[1:10:16] <Veluren> This level is one of the biggest ones in the game, I notice the framerate tends to be better in every level besides this one
[1:10:18] <+Beniial> I really hope there's a switch revision in the near future, because it's going to get left in the dust over the next few years otherwise
[1:10:18] <+CptBritches> Assuming we'll ever get it
[1:10:18] <dinnydanny777> God Urbosa is so good
[1:10:20] <%Garthunox> You can summon Mara
[1:10:20] <+harrisboe> I’ve heard it’s good
[1:10:21] <+AgiSkills> i hear strikers is less like a mousou and more like kingdom hearts
[1:10:21] <%jillpilled> apparently it's pretty alright
[1:10:23] <Warbot40> Does strikers run ok?
[1:10:30] <%skizzuto> Yusuke kinda plays like Vergil, I heard
[1:10:31] <RyuuAoi> I haven't played but low key plan on buying on the Switch.
[1:10:32] <redrins> you have persona switching from what I remember so its fine
[1:10:32] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[1:10:33] <simifu> really?
[1:10:36] <%BubbaRands> SOLD
[1:10:36] <%Alazull> Dick demon go!
[1:10:37] <+CookieCutter007> good
[1:10:38] <%Garthunox> Yes
[1:10:39] <%Aydarkzero> dick demon monkaS
[1:10:39] <%MidnightBurst12> sick
[1:10:41] <%AlteisenReiseZ> @PatStaresAt There's a PS4 Demo on the JP Shop
[1:10:41] <%Axellogic> Delicious dyucks
[1:10:41] <%Zeif00> You can summon all sorts of shit
[1:10:42] <Idon__> Is Strikers 60 fps?
[1:10:43] <%Ner234> I cast DICK
[1:10:44] <%MyNameIsRasus> You can
[1:10:44] <%TheHappyCynic> isn't there still turn based elements in p5s?
[1:10:45] <%iosephe> Hell yeah
[1:10:45] <%PadreHail> Strikers is probably better as a story and in terms of content but I haven't touched it
[1:10:46] <marvel877> P5 Strikers is also on PS4, so I wouldn't worry about it much Pat.
[1:10:47] <%Scorpion12590> instant buy
[1:10:47] <%RealThiele> Dick Chariot
[1:10:47] <%jillpilled> Dope
[1:10:49] <%Ynkubus_> Excellent
[1:10:49] <+abrupt_abe> Strikers is coming to PC so framerate is less of an issue
[1:10:50] <mattynezz> Good, but weirdly paced because it's actual combat encounters, not Musou maps
[1:10:58] <%Garthunox> It has a unique attack and everything
[1:11:01] <seaechiowai> why is pat so obsessed with deek today
[1:11:01] <majindusto> DICK CHARIOT
[1:11:01] <+Delenay> everyone has flurry rush too
[1:11:07] <$zackalan> Kappa500 Nintendo wouldn't put Ganon in a Legend of Zelda game, what are you Crazy talking aboutM
[1:11:08] <%SaiyanShoto> I wish I didn’t get bored playing musou games after 30 minutes
[1:11:09] <$zackalan> zackalan's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:11:10] <%PanicSwytch> 2hat about the Toilet Demon?
[1:11:10] <twoah> Speaking of dick demons, Khezu is back in Monhun
[1:11:12] <SomersaultJustice> you can also parry with your shield
[1:11:14] <%Valdorick> Music is banging
[1:11:22] <%Nobrev> I played the demo a while back it's actually a good mix of musou combat with P5 mechanics thrown in like elemental weaknesses, capturing personas to use, and all out attacks @PatStaresAt
[1:11:26] <$Artoo_The_Me> @patstaresat headshots still work
[1:11:33] <Maleicus> no
[1:11:33] <KaironFortressKnight> *gasp*
[1:11:33] <+OhioNitsud> you killed them so hard
[1:11:34] <valriot> Same concept as Hyrule, Warriors base groundworks, but the mechanics and gameplay is persona. You have a persona system, AOAs, Element affinity, ect
[1:11:34] <%MyNameIsRasus> NO WAY FRIEND
[1:11:34] <%YakumoYomi> C A K E
[1:11:37] <marvel877> Even the younglings.
[1:11:37] <Portal_Operater> lol
[1:11:38] <Mangahero18> SHOW US DA BUTT
[1:11:39] <%RealThiele> the mobwomen and mobchildren
[1:11:40] <%Aydarkzero> her butts always on display though
[1:11:40] <Saltmeisterr> HIYAAAAH
[1:11:40] <KingVantq> Link just wants ass
[1:11:41] <%Jaller101514> yeah, this game is pretty cool
[1:11:41] <iceballstwitch> remind pat that zelda is 16 in this right now
[1:11:42] <%TigerCatGo> BUTT, PLS
[1:11:42] <%BubbaRands> EXCUUUUSE ME PRINCESS
[1:11:43] <%Alazull> HYAAA let me see your butt
[1:11:45] <soledadarts> Zelda please let me hold hands
[1:11:49] <ToneBacas> @SaiyanShoto I assume they don't get any more challenging, that's why you get bored?
[1:11:51] <+It_sjustjoey> Ill believe it
[1:11:52] <+queaks> Zeldas Idle animation is legit her leaning over to look at a frog
[1:11:56] <%MyNameIsRasus> LINK IS CORRECT IN WANTING THAT CAKE
[1:11:57] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> These attack animations feel more like Shulk than Link.
[1:11:57] <%TigerCatGo> Thanks for translating, @PatStaresAt
[1:11:57] <%walternatorz> Pat's French is so good.
[1:11:57] <StarmanJay> Holy shit, one of my favorite internet personalities playing something from one of my favorite franchises? It must be Christmas!
[1:11:58] <%ThatMLPgamer> @SaiyanShoto These are always great podcast or TV show games to put in the background
[1:11:59] <Forester_Skippy> shhht guys but is later
[1:11:59] <%barrakuta371> Ah yes the language of HAAAAAAAH
[1:12:03] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> Outside of the item usage, that is
[1:12:05] <mattynezz> Even the children moblins :(
[1:12:05] <majindusto> Zelda is 16 tho
[1:12:13] <RyuuAoi> Okay of you kill this easy, I dont want it.
[1:12:17] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt switch to Hard mode after this level, it's more fun
[1:12:21] <dinnydanny777> Wizzrobes are kind of terrifying
[1:12:22] <%HunguyTV> This and Pirate Warriors 3 are probably my favoritt musou spin offs
[1:12:23] <mattynezz> Anakin is basically just Link if you think about it
[1:12:23] <%jessyg920> Am I the only one with the mind goblin of "every enemy must die" in these games?
[1:12:25] <pixelkenj> Did you ever hear about zelda's diary where she mentions why link doesn't talk?
[1:12:27] <Zombrocom> Wait P5 strikers is coming to PC before P5?
[1:12:32] <Mangahero18> In Hyrule the Age of Consent is 13.
[1:12:37] <Saltmeisterr> this game has a bit of jank
[1:12:38] <kersmushh> noooooooooooooo you missed the guy
[1:12:38] <%RealThiele> YAHAHA
[1:12:39] <Mangahero18> Probably
[1:12:39] <%HunguyTV> PW4 is fine
[1:12:46] <pixelkenj> get clubbed on
[1:12:46] <%TheHappyCynic> its kinda nuts how longtime action series like yakuza are becoming turn-based. and turn-based series like persona and final fantasy are becoming action games all at the same time.
[1:12:48] <dinnydanny777> I love that attack LUL
[1:12:49] <%delilah4you> Pat you look about as comfy as you could be
[1:12:51] <MattoBii> blow up that barrel
[1:12:54] <+Delenay> bomb the tree
[1:12:55] <%MidnightBurst12> bonk
[1:12:55] <+NecDW4> YO! These new Genshin characters look sweet!
[1:12:56] <SomersaultJustice> hit the barrel
[1:12:56] <WeebFever> Club'd
[1:12:59] <+polothegreatest> barrel pat
[1:13:03] <SomeOtherNeb> why is Pat not pressing The Button NotLikeThis

[1:13:28] <+pectusumbra> I mean he was the first pretty much
[1:13:30] <peachy996> Spinning is a neat trick
[1:13:30] <AoiRob> @BlowFireThroatTotem nope. she turns 17 during this game
[1:13:31] <%Garthunox> But it also determines his deathstyle
[1:13:33] <%ssjklyco> He'll spin you right round, baby
[1:13:36] <AMUSERNAME> SPEEEEN
[1:13:45] <mattynezz> Pat can't see giant Red Barrels, because he has never played a video game before
[1:13:47] <%Valdorick> Reminder that the Spin attack is Link's ANCIENT FAMILY TECHNIQUE... as told to us by Link's uncle in Link to the Past.
[1:13:52] <Bigyanno> Why is one of his moves not a Power Crouch Stab? Or maybe a super move that is just ISG?
[1:13:52] <%ThatMLPgamer> @BlowFireThroatTotem Sadly they say its her 17th birthday in this
[1:13:55] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> nalvS nalvS nalvS nalvS nalvS doodBait

[1:15:45] <$spardanwarrior> Still works for reflecting guardian lasers by the way
[1:15:45] <%tank7013> @patstaresat Only the three characters with shields can parry
[1:15:46] <AoiRob> local orb man eats shit trying to bait out parries. more at 11
[1:15:47] <%RealThiele> ah right its not all open yet
[1:15:49] <SomeOtherNeb> the soundtrack for this rules!
[1:15:55] <%TheHappyCynic> health is pretty low
[1:15:58] <simifu> Will paige upload the Game awards or is that risky with DMCA?
[1:16:01] <Saltmeisterr> SURE
[1:16:01] <%Mr_Pylon> spin it to win it
[1:16:02] <pixelkenj> Some characters you unlock will feel awkward to use at first but that usually passes after you unlock some more of their attacks
[1:16:06] <WeebFever> SHORE
[1:16:09] <SomeOtherNeb> SURE
[1:16:12] <valriot> YEP
[1:16:16] <AoiRob> the music slaps
[1:16:17] <iceballstwitch> this game kicks a surprising amount of ass
[1:16:19] <%solracc25> psaBig SirSword
[1:16:22] <%Valdorick> So a Mosu game, yeah.
[1:16:22] <Monkeyweed21> looks good, runs poor
[1:16:22] <%ThatMLPgamer> It looks fine and pretty just runs bad
[1:16:22] <dinnydanny777> Fair LUL
[1:16:25] <Saltmeisterr> yep
[1:16:25] <%the22cstomp> the game doesnt look bad it just runs awfully
[1:16:26] <%Bluwizard21> definitely made with the switch + in mind
[1:16:27] <%Jaller101514> it doesnt look bad, it looks like botw
[1:16:28] <%TheHappyCynic> I mean it looks pretty good
[1:16:29] <SomersaultJustice> look at that barrel you didn't explode
[1:16:31] <majindusto> SURE PAT, SUUUUUUUURE
[1:16:33] <Veluren> This was a first for a Musou game for me in that there isn't a single character I hated playing as, everyone is fun to me
[1:16:33] <%GarbageNirvana> @simifu With as much as was manually muted last night idk that there is a risk
[1:16:34] <%coreyyotto> is there a switch game that isn't like that to some degree though?
[1:16:34] <Forester_Skippy> you should try bombing those moblin towers later always a fun time
[1:16:42] <kersmushh> yep!
[1:16:43] <+Delenay> quests!
[1:16:43] <+RowenCleric> i mean its story is kinda garbage too, gameplay is neat though
[1:16:44] <Bigyanno> Games should either look like garbage or run like garbage, not both
[1:16:44] <mattynezz> It looks fine
[1:16:44] <%RealThiele> welcome to botw
[1:16:45] <+VantaXIV> Like cyberpunk 2077 🤔

[1:25:42] <nevan_44> LUL
[1:25:44] <+KENTASHIRO> He wasn't really a twink in Ocarina. I feel like he was kinda buff there
[1:25:44] <seaechiowai> @tigerfang86 no
[1:25:46] <%Agami23> i dont remember this, but damn if it aint the truest thing ever
[1:25:49] <%brachydios777> Definitely since Ocarina
[1:25:52] <%mostbrokenrobo> isn't that just encouraging stereotyping?
[1:25:53] <%kewlmyc> He's also canonically short as fuck in this game. Even Zelda is taller than him
[1:25:53] <+KENTASHIRO> considering he was like 15
[1:25:55] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The Twink of Time
[1:25:56] <black_pariah> half his outfit in ocarina is the female villager set
[1:25:56] <%cvp5127> link will eat a rock

[1:26:49] <The_Maddness> Wizzrobes are the worst
[1:26:52] <%bevyrage> musou games never have any systems with what you're wearing, only what you're wielding
[1:26:53] <pixelkenj> theres a few elemental weaknesses, too
[1:26:55] <very_ap3> oh no youre playing this game that im MAD about
[1:26:57] <seaechiowai> ! Plague at risk !
[1:27:08] <Not_Dutch_> "Link is a twink icon" as he plays as naked Link
[1:27:09] <%SmoochSpider> There is no brain to protect
[1:27:11] <%ThatMLPgamer> @PlagueOfGripes Yo Pat asked earlier if Mipha kept dropping her eggs in front of link to make her fuck him, does that work?
[1:27:11] <%rumtumtugnutz> That way Link has two helmets
[1:27:11] <Vaun0x> never forget those treehouse girls who insisted on unequippimg his shirt during the botw e3 presentation
[1:27:11] <Bigyanno> I liked the Wizzrobes from Majora's Mask the best. They were like grumpy goblins that spun on glowing squares
[1:27:16] <SomersaultJustice> ice wizzrobe dropped ice powers
[1:27:20] <mattynezz> Magnesis on buried chests to pull them up
[1:27:22] <%THATGUY_789> link is raw dogging it
[1:27:23] <@PlagueOfGripes> I haven't encountered any clothing that's new from Breath of the Wild yet, aside from the Hyrule Warriors outfit

[1:27:36] <Sokumotanaka> Impa always has been
[1:27:36] <%GG_sensay> yes
[1:27:37] <+tigerfang86> SHADOW CLONE JUTSU TOO OP
[1:27:37] <%Jaller101514> @patstaresat some guy did the math, and found Botw link to be second strongest. only behind Link to the past link, because that final boss is the most ridiculous of them all
[1:27:38] <$Afterman_> impa is VERY strong
[1:27:40] <%Aydarkzero> literally one woman army
[1:27:42] <%kewlmyc> She's the best character in the game easy

[1:27:44] <peachy996> dattebayo
[1:27:45] <%skizzuto> impa's got the deeps
[1:27:46] <%Ynkubus_> Rule of ninja
[1:27:47] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt Impa is the only character where here A special is just part of her rotation
[1:27:50] <%tank7013> And she only gets more busted over time
[1:27:51] <pixelkenj> i had impa single handedly fight off a platoon of guardians in one level
[1:27:56] <%RealThiele> she stole everyones weapons
[1:27:56] <@PlagueOfGripes> you're catching the weapon out of midair and then controlling it
[1:27:57] <AoiRob> @PatStaresAt you can use the Stasis time freeze to keep the Weakness meter up for longer
[1:27:58] <%Jaller101514> holy shit
[1:28:03] <+kiradusk4200> Naruto Ninja Impa out here killing armies
[1:28:04] <%SmoochSpider> good jorb
[1:28:04] <Bigyanno> I don't even know what happened there
[1:28:05] <spicystarbursts> this game cant handle its own nonsense attacks
[1:28:07] <SomersaultJustice> LUL
[1:28:07] <+Beniial> Whoever thought to give Link a timestop was a genius
[1:28:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> I hope they they flesh out the Yiga clan more in the BOTW sequel
[1:28:09] <Sokumotanaka> she naruto run
[1:28:10] <chancho4tierra> wow impa rocks
[1:28:11] <%AzureGale> YOU SURE OPENED THOSE CHESTS
[1:28:11] <mattynezz> Yeah, FUCK the box
[1:28:11] <%Ner234> That was cool
[1:28:14] <%YakumoYomi> She's strong, but not busted. Wait until you see later characters
[1:28:15] <+JustToWatch> SHE'S SO COOL
[1:28:16] <%Agami23> he had a metal hammer i think
[1:28:18] <Vaun0x> she gets better, her weak point slashes get pretty good
[1:28:19] <%Aydarkzero> stasis monkaS
[1:28:20] <GeltonZ> Impa was amazing in the first game if you gave her the Naginata so good to know THAT'S still a thing.
[1:28:20] <@PlagueOfGripes> it rips weapons out of enemy hands
[1:28:22] <%Nobrev> it was throwing a metal weapon at you

[1:28:46] <%Jaxnos> you definitely got it, pat
[1:28:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> you don't. this guardian is the whole mission
[1:28:46] <ExpressNode> Don't you mean their Wii U Pads Kappa
[1:28:47] <Saltmeisterr> ITS LU BU
[1:28:48] <crimsonsaens> LUL

[1:28:50] <AoiRob> RUn
[1:28:51] <%Jaxnos> just leeeeeeean i-
[1:28:51] <%Valdorick> Do not Pursue Guardian Lu Bu
[1:28:51] <%RealThiele> OBJECTIVE: RUN BITCH
[1:28:51] <%Aydarkzero> uh
[1:28:52] <Saltmeisterr> DO NOT PURSUE
[1:28:54] <%weissguard> You got this, you play Zelda
[1:28:54] <%rumtumtugnutz> Why does it have a laser dick
[1:28:57] <%tank7013> You can actually fight it now and end the mission
[1:28:57] <valriot> Shoot it into space with Stasis
[1:28:58] <SomersaultJustice> DO NOT PURSUE LU BU
[1:28:58] <The_Maddness> you cant beat this one I think
[1:28:59] <%YakumoYomi> DO NOT PURSUE LU BU
[1:29:00] <numbus_26> DO NOT PURSUE
[1:29:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> remember, you can still parry their lasers with Guard + Y
[1:29:00] <%Jaller101514> i dont think your allowed to win
[1:29:00] <Bigyanno> DO NOT PURSUE LU BU
[1:29:01] <pixelkenj> I did this in the demo
[1:29:02] <$Afterman_> do NOT PURSURE GUARDIAN
[1:29:03] <kersmushh> at least they tell you though
[1:29:04] <auraofdawn> i dont think you can kill it
[1:29:05] <%SmoochSpider> destroy crates
[1:29:06] <dinnydanny777> You can kill it if you're good enough
[1:29:06] <+Beniial> Objective: fuck fuck fuck fuck
[1:29:07] <redrins> no anti guardian weapons
[1:29:09] <majindusto> DON'T BE A BITCH ...KILL IT
[1:29:10] <CursedNobleman> DO NOT PURSUE LU BU
[1:29:13] <pixelkenj> Beating it just ends the mission instantly
[1:29:14] <Darkfire346> ALWAYS PURSUE LU BU
[1:29:14] <%Nobrev> I mean you CAN kill it here it just takes a while
[1:29:15] <@PlagueOfGripes> you can kill that Guardian early but it'll skip the rest of the mission
[1:29:17] <+polothegreatest> remember to side step
[1:29:18] <%TheHappyCynic> let the red shirts do the work
[1:29:19] <seaechiowai> liu bu psaHoldon
[1:29:22] <mattynezz> You CAN just beat it, but it takes a minute
[1:29:24] <$Artoo_The_Me> You can totally kill it tho
[1:29:25] <dinnydanny777> @auraofdawn I did kill it, it took forever LUL
[1:29:26] <+Ancopro> yup
[1:29:28] <simifu> Its weird cause FE warriors runs fine
[1:29:29] <majindusto> YOU CAN KILL IT
[1:29:30] <StarmanJay> Pat, you can absolutely parry the lasers and kill it now.
[1:29:31] <%greasypete00> what level is this
[1:29:31] <$Afterman_> correct
[1:29:32] <Vaun0x> ayup
[1:29:32] <kersmushh> probably because of the grass
[1:29:33] <%Daniel_Is_I> They wanted to open on a setpiecew
[1:29:33] <%PadreHail> YEAH
[1:29:34] <marvel877> yeah
[1:29:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> It's a tutorial
[1:29:36] <The_Maddness> its about setting expectations
[1:29:39] <Veluren> Hyrule Field is crazy taxing on FPS, every other stage is usually fine
[1:29:42] <%RealThiele> throw yourselves upon guards
[1:29:42] <@PlagueOfGripes> I killed it early the first time but it takes a while
[1:29:42] <spicystarbursts> Keep expectations low at the beginning
[1:29:43] <%Ranryu692> gotta get it out of the way
[1:29:44] <Bigyanno> It actually seemed totally beatable
[1:29:44] <%averyoddjew> open areas make it dip, but otherwise it's fine
[1:29:45] <+abrupt_abe> As someone who beat it, the first level is actually the worse
[1:29:46] <%Jaxnos> i just watched impa fly
[1:29:46] <SomersaultJustice> I wish there was a performance mode, like FE Warriors
[1:29:47] <%Valdorick> "We call this the Investor Level, because investors don't care about Frames, only how pretty it looks"
[1:29:48] <spicystarbursts> end up on a strong note
[1:29:48] <robotman37> @The_Maddness Oh you can very early in the game it's just a bitch to kill
[1:29:52] <%HunguyTV> Just like the plateau in botw
[1:29:56] <marvel877> Yeah, but the timings off on the parry in this game.
[1:29:56] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt with certain characters u can make this game TANK
[1:29:58] <%TheHappyCynic> they want you to earn the game
[1:30:00] <AMUSERNAME> Worst performing, but the OPEN WORLD VISTAS THO LUL

[1:38:07] <Forester_Skippy> only characters that have a shield while blocking can
[1:38:08] <%kyh9> She’s great
[1:38:10] <%AzureGale> AND THIS IS TO GO FURTHER BEYOND
[1:38:10] <%patriotrenegade> @PatStaresAt can u turn off Zelda's voice acting
[1:38:18] <%Redpointshine> Im late, hows he like the Hyrule Warriors?
[1:38:21] <%weissguard> This Zelda has a struggle with not being able to call upon her powers with ease, so she instead opts for her interest in archaeology, iirc.
[1:38:23] <Discount_CJ> ouch
[1:38:23] <%kyh9> She’s got the iPad pro
[1:38:27] <%SmoochSpider> You can change to Japanese though
[1:38:27] <StarmanJay> This is actually Zelda's lesser weapon set.
[1:38:28] <steelstwitchaccount> Is this actually a new game or just DLC for Hyrule Warriors?
[1:38:28] <%kewlmyc> LUL

[1:38:40] <seaechiowai> dat ass do be fat
[1:38:41] <Mangahero18> ITS HER BEST FEATURE.
[1:38:41] <majindusto> British Zelda is BEST Zelda
[1:38:43] <%ssjklyco> That's how they BUTTer us up
[1:38:43] <%za7az> Nice LUL
[1:38:44] <%Jaxnos> that was a mandate set by Nintendo
[1:38:45] <Discount_CJ> You can switch the VA to Jap
[1:38:45] <%Aydarkzero> like /jill in the 3ds game Kappa
[1:38:49] <%TheHappyCynic> How else are they gonna save nintendo
[1:38:52] <%GarbageNirvana> Someone at Nintendo is an ass man, clearly
[1:38:52] <%BubbaRands> It's an important character trait Kappa
[1:38:53] <cyclone722> her voice acting in this game is a bit better
[1:38:54] <+paladinstarbuster> I hate BOTW Zelda so much
[1:38:54] <+teh_rawk> mipha best fish
[1:38:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> @steelstwitchaccount It's a new game
[1:38:57] <Mr_Strut> The triforce of donk
[1:38:58] <%YakumoYomi> @steelstwitchaccount New game
[1:38:59] <+CookieCutter007> ooOOO the framerate
[1:39:02] <pixelkenj> I mean her Idle animation is a reference to the frog cutscene
[1:39:07] <%Redpointshine> The VA is fine, you guys are just mean
[1:39:07] <Darkfire346> this is approaching Drakengard levels of cannon fodder here
[1:39:10] <SomersaultJustice> just play it in weeb language like the rest of us
[1:39:16] <Hideow> jesus poor switch LUL
[1:39:24] <steelstwitchaccount> Huh, I thought Pat hated DW / Musou Games?
[1:39:24] <%RetroCop87> Skyward Sword Zelda is best Zelda, this is undeniable
[1:39:25] <Discount_CJ> @PatStaresAt you can switch the VA to Jap if you want
[1:39:28] <Saltmeisterr> check out her super tho
[1:39:29] <$Afterman_> pat missed the weak meter hit
[1:39:32] <Hyperfludd> leave va in eng to make ppl mad
[1:39:34] <%SmoochSpider> You can change the VA to Japanese from the title screen @PatStaresAt
[1:39:36] <Veluren> Zelda is an army buster in this game, but you have to gives her upgrades and get used to how freaking bizarre she plays
[1:39:43] <+teh_rawk> spirit tracks zelda underrated
[1:39:43] <Bigyanno> Tetra best Zelda
[1:39:45] <$FluffiTamamo> Why does Zelda's fighting look so...dorky?
[1:39:45] <The_Maddness> Im pretty sure that magensis attacks has a lot more moves to it
[1:39:46] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat hasn't done the running up the stairs attack yet
[1:39:52] <Hideow> Leave it on english pls Kappa
[1:39:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> just keep mashing Y
[1:40:03] <%Redpointshine> There should be an active Frame counter in like, the corner of the screen
[1:40:06] <peachy996> Zelda must be painful to the ears, it's the only way for Zelda to be
[1:40:10] <dinnydanny777> Is that an area of effect time stop
[1:40:11] <The_Maddness> And that here Ice attack has more parts to it
[1:40:12] <+teh_rawk> only cowards switch languages
[1:40:14] <+paladinstarbuster> why didn't Zelda study the blade like in Ocarina
[1:40:20] <iceballstwitch> her remote bomb is the best
[1:40:20] <Shwepie> @FluffiTamamo She's a nerd, how could it not look dorky?
[1:40:22] <mattynezz> She gets extended combos that are MUCH stronger
[1:40:24] <%GG_sensay> yyx and detonate is the best move for now
[1:40:24] <SomersaultJustice> they get better when you learn more moves
[1:40:24] <+queaks> Need more combo
[1:40:25] <$Afterman_> @PatStaresAt zelda's best combo is her rolling bomb attack, its a huge aoe damage dealer
[1:40:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah Zelda isn't amazing until later in the game
[1:40:26] <Saltmeisterr> Check out her super Pat
[1:40:26] <Monkeyweed21> thats correct
[1:40:27] <%AzureGale> mmm, wall
[1:40:28] <ToneBacas> tasty wall
[1:40:30] <pixelkenj> he needs the sodium in the rock

[1:41:10] <fusedforms> stole his soul with your demon camera
[1:41:11] <+Ancopro> she's covered wars yknow
[1:41:11] <Bigyanno> Wizzrobes are very shy. They don't like having thier pictures taken
[1:41:15] <%Jaller101514> That move makes more sense with a big group
[1:41:18] <$FluffiTamamo> Force him to take cringe selfies
[1:41:23] <marvel877> STOLE HIS SOUL

[1:41:32] <%ElkRiverDog> Did she just fatal frame that wiz robe?
[1:41:35] <kersmushh> @Jaller101514 not really...
[1:41:38] <seaechiowai> social media bullying for the kill
[1:41:45] <mattynezz> Another cool thing about Zelda, her attacks count as their Sheika Slate equivalents, so her bomb roll counts as a bomb attack for breaking enemies
[1:41:51] <+teh_rawk> she doxed them
[1:42:00] <%HunguyTV> you sort through the runes with y then do its combo by tapping x several times after
[1:42:00] <%RealThiele> itstime
[1:42:00] <Hideow> God,I see the gameplay getting stale really quckly
[1:42:01] <%Valdorick> She takes your picture then bans you from her OnlyFans

[1:42:14] <kersmushh> @Valdorick nooooooooooooooooooooo

[1:43:54] <%Redpointshine> This seems like a fun game
[1:44:00] <+pectusumbra> You know maybe it's because I didn't play BOTW but I didn't appreciate how guardians are just super Beambos till right now
[1:44:04] <PulverKong> Impa is A tier for sure

[1:47:10] <steelstwitchaccount> Don't feel bad for her.
[1:47:12] <%Dr_DangerPhD> "He must win"
[1:47:12] <peachy996> Oooh my Undertaker!
[1:47:14] <%jillpilled> LUL
[1:47:15] <%SmoochSpider> You can change VA to Japanese from title screen if you want @PatStaresAt
[1:47:15] <%Mr_Pylon> everyone gets a diferent accent
[1:47:16] <%Agami23> she sounds like she is constantly crying
[1:47:16] <dinnydanny777> She's a Canadian doing an English impression too
[1:47:17] <auraofdawn> i like her
[1:47:18] <%TigerCatGo> I dislike these English voices....
[1:47:18] <%sighphers> it's 100% the voice director
[1:47:18] <%greasypete00> this will not come to piss
[1:47:19] <%averyoddjew> i blame the voice direction she was given
[1:47:20] <tattleworm> she was directed badly
[1:47:22] <%Dylveryn> Impa could seriously do this all herself she's so strong why is Link here
[1:47:22] <%TheLemuroid> Narrator: It came to pass
[1:47:22] <%Garthunox> its clearly an american trying to be british
[1:47:23] <Vaun0x> impa's "oh god kill me now" face when purah shows up lmao
[1:47:23] <%Redpointshine> I think her VA is fine but Why is she british?
[1:47:27] <+Ancopro> it doesn't, pretty nintendo just wanted that
[1:47:27] <%RealThiele> the direction is bad then
[1:47:28] <@PlagueOfGripes> yeah Zelda's eng voice sucks
[1:47:28] <+karmahoudini_guitar> it's not just the voice, her acting isn't very good
[1:47:28] <%za7az> I actually like her voice
[1:47:29] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt it actually doesn't lol
[1:47:30] <Forester_Skippy> its kinda sad when voice direction gives the actor a bad rep
[1:47:30] <+deviljhojho_> change it to spanish
[1:47:31] <Darkfire346> SHE FUCKING SOUNDS LIKE PAUL BEARER
[1:47:33] <steelstwitchaccount> It's a good thing one sword can do all this.
[1:47:33] <BooitsDock> but why she british
[1:47:34] <peachy996> Aw man who said "He must win"
[1:47:34] <%kewlmyc> You should always blame the voice director
[1:47:36] <%mike2hands> YES
[1:47:36] <auraofdawn> people are too weird about voice actors
[1:47:37] <ToneBacas> always blame direction
[1:47:37] <+Ancopro> rmember sunshine peach
[1:47:40] <+CookieCutter007> blame Kingdom Hearts voice director
[1:47:40] <marvel877> Pat, we tell you you're bad at your job and you just shrug and go, "Yeah."
[1:47:42] <ammobasket> She was probably hired for that voice
[1:47:42] <peachy996> Fucking Mortal Kombat 9
[1:47:44] <%Valdorick> This seems like something a Japanese voice director would do
[1:47:44] <+Delenay> i dont like zeldas va. she sounds to whispy
[1:47:45] <%ssjklyco> He only directed her bad?
[1:47:46] <BluBox> It's usually their fault anyways
[1:47:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> she's doing a fine job with terrible direction
[1:47:48] <%jillpilled> I'm just tired of fantasy voices being English people lol
[1:47:49] <%Valdorick> "Sound weak and innocent."
[1:47:49] <Saltmeisterr> its most likely the va director
[1:47:49] <+karmahoudini_guitar> this is why I play BotW in japanese dub
[1:47:52] <%TigerCatGo> I blame Voice Director then psaUp
[1:47:54] <%hoodedlefty> Am I the only one that likes her voice
[1:47:54] <Not_Dutch_> time to get the kamidogu
[1:47:54] <Sokumotanaka> He says AFTER insulting her
[1:47:55] <%TheLemuroid> Well if all the voice acting is bad then it probably isn't the voice actors
[1:47:57] <%xXjuffelXx> I think her voice is fine
[1:48:01] <illtima> Can I blame your voice director, Pat?
[1:48:04] <%DrBunni> your good voice?
[1:48:04] <steelstwitchaccount> Of course its overrun with monsters. Anything but that woukd be deviating from the norm.
[1:48:05] <+Pookiedaexzile> Sound like a small birb
[1:48:06] <ToneBacas> sounds true
[1:48:07] <%TheBensonator_> "Do it good tho" - that guy, some year
[1:48:08] <%Agami23> "no, you need to sound more like your crying. princesses dont have confidence!" -voice director. probably
[1:48:10] <+Delenay> rhoam sucks!
[1:48:10] <%jillpilled> it's director, her voice is fine tho
[1:48:13] <%AzureGale> thx for clarifying Pat
[1:48:13] <%GarbageNirvana> See: any English voice acting directed by a Japanese director
[1:48:15] <+Delenay> worst king
[1:48:16] <KaironFortressKnight> But the story was so believable
[1:48:18] <+teh_rawk> but do your good voice nerd
[1:48:22] <%GarbageNirvana> Particularly Mega Man 8
[1:48:23] <%patriotrenegade> GET IN THE MAMMOTH MIPHA
[1:48:23] <%ThatMLPgamer> Its weird cuz there are a couple of super legit VA's in this game like Sean Chiplock but then they have a couple first timers thrown in there randomly
[1:48:23] <%walternatorz> is Paige pat's voice director?
[1:48:24] <simifu> is zang your voice director?
[1:48:24] <+SilverDevilfish> "Do it good" - 90's voice direction
[1:48:27] <Discount_CJ> finally
[1:48:28] <%Redpointshine> "You need to be MORE british if possible"
[1:48:29] <%SharkMissile> Except Rivali, fuck that guy
[1:48:30] <kersmushh> and also ravioli!
[1:48:31] <%Valdorick> Fucking Elmo, not directing Pat properly when he starts stumbling over his words.
[1:48:31] <%Dylveryn> Pat has become the one guy
[1:48:31] <%patriotrenegade> OR SIDON WILL PILOT IT AGAIN
[1:48:31] <%jillpilled> Just make your voice better idiot 4Head
[1:48:31] <iceballstwitch> Zelda in this and Breath sounds like Danny from Game Grumps doing a girl voice
[1:48:32] <+Ancopro> nintendo was prob just like sound like princess
[1:48:32] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> VoHiYo500 fun fact. there's 4 optional characters you can unlock. 2 of them are only unlocked during the post-game. Not gonna say who they are or how to get them, but just do those side missions and you'll get them.
[1:48:34] <Darkfire346> in this instance, the voice director cusses them out in japanese and then says they did a great job
[1:48:34] <%GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz> GiantRatThatMakesTheRulz's Cheer shared rewards to 10 others in Chat! 
[1:48:35] <PulverKong> you can also play as the king

[2:03:37] <%kyh9> This game has so much love in it
[2:03:37] <+snurtlord> pat likes daruk bc theyre the same shape
[2:03:40] <PulverKong> i don't get daruks lava power thing they never pop up where i need them
[2:03:45] <+durgaaz> Of course Pat likes Daruk, Daruk is an orb
[2:03:53] <%PadreHail> Daruk is a fuckin killer for crowd control
[2:03:54] <@SoFarFetched> How are we so sure you're not wearing one right now, Paige? geefPoint
[2:03:57] <%RealThiele> oops i crapped my pants
[2:04:06] <SolsticeZro> but then he did
[2:04:08] <%KineKithZen> Bargain Bin Macho Man
[2:04:12] <+Beniial> "I think they're big"
[2:04:13] <%Daniel_Is_I> Gorons embody the spirit of ORB
[2:04:14] <iceballstwitch> gorons have little fish eyes
[2:04:15] <RyuuAoi> I feel you, Peach. Hospitals/catheters suck.
[2:04:15] <dinnydanny777> SourPls
[2:04:15] <+TurnipKupo> YEEEEEEEEEEET gorons <3
[2:04:15] <%TheBensonator_> "You know who else is on board with your plan? MY MOM"
[2:04:17] <theugliestguitar> Gorons are big and strong and friends
[2:04:17] <Ozavic> DADDY SIGHTED
[2:04:18] <%za7az> He's so nice
[2:04:20] <%Wade_Willson> Z TARGET THE BAG FOR MASSIVE DAMAGE
[2:04:20] <PulverKong> Daruk is Pat incarnate
[2:04:22] <peachy996> He is Macho Man
[2:04:22] <seaechiowai> no, but you will definitely z-target that bag tho
[2:04:22] <Vaun0x> @pulverkong they show up after Y then a strong X attack
[2:04:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> they have nipples and only men
[2:04:26] <mattynezz> His feet are so tiny
[2:04:28] <overlord_nico> Agreed
[2:04:29] <+Halfsock> gorons are so round and strong, they're perfect
[2:04:29] <Sokumotanaka> Are gorons just rock drawves?
[2:04:32] <+Ancopro> gorons are orbs is ya think bout it
[2:04:34] <%solracc25> psaBig psaBig psaBig psaBig
[2:04:35] <%TheLakinessMonster> How do you Z-target in this game?

[2:04:38] <PulverKong> @Vaun0x yeah but never where you need em
[2:04:39] <+Promessa_EX> better have some icy foods
[2:04:40] <SGrim> Gorons reproduce by Fragmentation. They need to get their rocks off. SeemsGood
[2:04:41] <Gorgs7> LoZ dwarves!
[2:04:44] <+teelor32> The 2020's will be the decade of the Big Boi archetype, Daruk being one of them
[2:04:45] <Hyperfludd> round is good
[2:04:46] <majindusto> Of course...Pat is just a Goron himself
[2:04:46] <theugliestguitar> I like how they just made Daruk Macho Man Randy Savage
[2:04:48] <AoiRob> they sure are big 😳
[2:04:49] <DandyPunching> Gorons ALWAYS skip leg day...ALWAYS
[2:04:52] <peachy996> @PlagueOfGripes The nipples are pebbles
[2:04:53] <redrins> because lava is death
[2:04:54] <Alzero83> Gorons are terrible
[2:04:55] <%Daniel_Is_I> Because it's a mountain of death
[2:04:55] <+teh_rawk> theyre a race of hulkamaniacs
[2:04:56] <@SoFarFetched> why not LIFE mountain
[2:04:56] <%Garthunox> apes
[2:04:57] <%RealThiele> cause welcome to die
[2:05:02] <%Daxalog> So his Dodge attack is the easiest to get off
[2:05:02] <Frozen_phoenix> tradition!
[2:05:03] <%za7az> Because it smells
[2:05:03] <%TheLemuroid> Do you burst into flames?
[2:05:05] <%Ynkubus_> Cos its cool
[2:05:05] <Sokumotanaka> Someone draw pat as a goron!
[2:05:05] <%Alazull> @patstaresat Just found a gay bay in Cyberpunk called Dicky Twister
[2:05:06] <$Skelemungus> why arent hey combusting into flame
[2:05:08] <PulverKong> Revali is so good in this game. Just get airborne and shoot everything
[2:05:08] <zekana> what else do you call an active volcano pat?
[2:05:09] <%enward_hardar> death mountain is like a greenland/iceland naming convention
[2:05:09] <%Daniel_Is_I> BIG AND STRONG
[2:05:11] <%Jaller101514> Because people DIE there , Pat
[2:05:12] <%Bonkasaurusrex> Bonkasaurusrex subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 12 months! Now Hyrule Warriors is cool and all, but have you heard about the greatest game of all time Final Fantasy XI?

[2:07:00] <@PlagueOfGripes> ipads for all
[2:07:00] <PulverKong> Everyone has different ipad attacks it's pretty cool
[2:07:04] <%AzureGale> But it wasn't a rock... it was a ROCK GORON
[2:07:04] <%Redpointshine> what fucking framrate is this game running at? llike 25?
[2:07:04] <RyuuAoi> Roll dash woolieGLORY
[2:07:05] <auraofdawn> zelda splurged on ipads for everyone

[2:07:17] <SolsticeZro> he has the nokia edition
[2:07:18] <PulverKong> And all their ipad attacks are different too
[2:07:24] <+Promessa_EX> cool kodachi
[2:07:25] <+teh_rawk> zelda accidently ordered like 20
[2:07:28] <kersmushh> pause and look in the character menu dude
[2:07:30] <peachy996> How can Revali use his ipad with big awkward feather fingers
[2:07:32] <pixelkenj> you can use it as a ramp too
[2:07:33] <%kyh9> Every character has unique iPad animations
[2:07:33] <PulverKong> @YakumoYomi nah he just unlocked him 5 minutes ago
[2:07:37] <Vaun0x> @redpointshine 20-30, occasionally 10-15 in co op
[2:07:37] <%Valdorick> O-Purah gave everyone an iPad
[2:07:40] <+snurtlord> pat u can probably run by holding the dash button after a dash if its anything like the first game
[2:07:46] <LoneFonte> zelda paid for a custom ipad pro
[2:07:54] <+CookieCutter007> timing fucked with this framerate
[2:07:56] <The_Maddness> @peachy996 probably beaks it
[2:07:57] <RyuuAoi> TANK CONTROLS
[2:07:58] <+teelor32> i like to imagine that getting the ipad is like a bonus gift for joining the group
[2:07:59] <%AzureGale> What would be the equivalent of Apple in the Zelda universe
[2:08:07] <%RealThiele> press x while rolling
[2:08:08] <%N0bdyNoOne> Pat how are you surviving the frammmmess.

[2:10:18] <peachy996> DARUK IS READDDDDYYYY
[2:10:18] <SuperDinosauce> Does it feel like they made the big enemies a little too chunky in this one versus HWDX?
[2:10:20] <Vaun0x> SNAP INTO A SLIM JUM, BROTHER
[2:10:25] <+Take_2_shots> Why is Pat playing the Zelda game?
[2:10:29] <%HunguyTV> you. can order character around the map
[2:10:29] <mattynezz> Korok
[2:10:30] <+Aggro_Will> Macho Man Randy "The Rock" Savage
[2:10:41] <PulverKong> why use combos when you can just mash X all the time anyway
[2:10:44] <RyuuAoi> PUT AL METAL AWAY ugh
[2:10:49] <PulverKong> this game is too ez
[2:10:49] <%kyh9> The differences between characters is pretty rad tbh
[2:10:51] <SuperDinosauce> Seems like it takes forever to chew that healthbar down by comparison.

[2:11:57] <The_Maddness> wait was that a WALL JUMP command?
[2:12:00] <RyuuAoi> @pulverkong I think that's the point tbh. More for story to hold over for BOTW II
[2:12:04] <SuperDinosauce> I'm just saying it looks like it takes way longer.
[2:12:06] <Forester_Skippy> look at that special build up on 1 guy

[2:16:03] <Vaun0x> YAHAHA MOTHERFUCKERS
[2:16:04] <RyuuAoi> @vaun0x Could have been the next Metal Gear tbh. Think about it!
[2:16:07] <PulverKong> pat's mind goblins will love these guys
[2:16:08] <+DoggyT> NOw it is ON your Menu for Evvveerrrrrr...
[2:16:10] <Jolnir> DansGame
[2:16:18] <%PadreHail> I still have like 35 Korok seeds right now
[2:16:19] <SolsticeZro> time to get 900 koroks for a turd LUL
[2:16:26] <%Valdorick> That guy looks RAD
[2:16:32] <+Promessa_EX> oplague streamo?
[2:16:34] <%PadreHail> They give really good ass buffs though
[2:16:36] <The_Maddness> Oh, I just remembered how this quest ends
[2:16:43] <Vaun0x> @ryuuaoi man... 😔
[2:16:48] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:16:50] <+teh_rawk> fire on the fire goblin
[2:16:55] <PulverKong> just spam the rods any time you get em. always breaks the shield
[2:17:00] <DXLelouch24> Not like this not like this
[2:17:05] <%Valdorick> Fire on the fire boss in the fire zone with the fire level
[2:17:06] <%juxtest> His weak point was his entire body
[2:17:11] <+CookieCutter007> Pat has the biggest kokoro
[2:17:14] <RyuuAoi> @PeachSaliva talk to us!
[2:17:14] <mattynezz> Got to give it to Pat, he's good at hitting that dodge window
[2:17:18] <+Take_2_shots> The Mon Stars?
[2:17:22] <+teh_rawk> give orders to the other 2 pat
[2:17:24] <mattynezz> Link is the only close one
[2:17:25] <+unfoldingchoas> Pat doesn't know Element Weakness yet?
[2:17:32] <%Aydarkzero> for some reason i thought he was dual wielding greatswords
[2:17:37] <%PadreHail> There's elemental weaknesses in this game, save the rods
[2:17:46] <+AutechreTwinAphex> there's a fun game here once it runs on an emulator at 60fps
[2:18:02] <%Garthunox> Pat Yoshi-
[2:18:05] <KaironFortressKnight> Liquid hot MAAAAGMAAAA
[2:18:10] <%PadreHail> Especially cuz there's bosses in this game that fuck your shit if you can't block effectively and pot shot them
[2:18:11] <auraofdawn> they see him rollin
[2:18:14] <%RealThiele> iirc some are press and hold x and y
[2:18:14] <%PadreHail> Fuckin Revali
[2:18:17] <%Aydarkzero> if there is a switch pro this should be the first game the showcase the performance
[2:18:27] <%RealThiele> oh wait wrong character
[2:18:27] <PulverKong> It's a shame that this game isn't open world at all, there's invisi-walls all over the place
[2:18:27] <%YakumoYomi> It's still fun...but the performance issues are definitely a bummer
[2:18:28] <RyuuAoi> Combos
[2:18:28] <Saltmeisterr> YES
[2:18:31] <Saltmeisterr> ahem
[2:18:33] <+Take_2_shots> Is this Fred Dursts's favorite game because of Durak?
[2:18:33] <+teh_rawk> if pat could roll everywhere he would
[2:18:37] <kersmushh> -
[2:18:37] <PulverKong> i wanna climb everywhere like in botw
[2:18:39] <mattynezz> Go to the screen with weapons
[2:18:41] <SaltyAzteca> Goron Guts
[2:18:41] <RyuuAoi> Wall jump
[2:18:48] <Vaun0x> there ya go bud
[2:18:53] <%PadreHail> @aydarkzero Witcher 3 is on Switch
[2:18:57] <pixelkenj> can roll off of that ramp
[2:18:58] <justinjones1989> The X X X and the Y Y Y you will be suked
[2:19:05] <PulverKong> yeah it's like XXY XXXY XXXXY
[2:19:05] <RyuuAoi> THIS AINT SF
[2:19:08] <%AzureGale> This map looks like a Mario Kart track :x
[2:19:13] <%UncleAWOL> UncleAWOL subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 28 months! Hello Pat! Here is my monthly "Stay in the discord" message. Did you hear that some codebreakers recently solved the Zodiac Killer's cipher, "The 340" that had been unsolved since Nov 1969? Fascinating stuff
[2:19:15] <godzookylives> Is this better or worse than the first Hyrule Warriors?
[2:19:16] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Witcher 3 runs on Switch at like 144p - it's a complete compromise of a port
[2:19:16] <@SoFarFetched> then you get the suck
[2:19:16] <RyuuAoi> OKAY IT IS
[2:19:20] <%Aydarkzero> @PadreHail anybody who would actually play that would do so on pc
[2:19:27] <PulverKong> Y is always the finisher attack in the combos
[2:19:29] <majindusto> OG COURSE
[2:19:32] <%RealThiele> x while roll
[2:19:34] <majindusto> *OF
[2:19:38] <pixelkenj> just roll over enemies
[2:19:41] <%Aydarkzero> but i suppose it's not a bad idea
[2:19:45] <Saltmeisterr> @godzookylives gameplaywise yes, content wise no
[2:19:46] <%juxtest> The Gorons all look like they're wearing little chef hats
[2:19:48] <+AutechreTwinAphex> Switch will never ever run Cyberpunk - doesn't matter if you go 80p, it will never run it
[2:19:52] <PulverKong> but rolling over them don't kill them
[2:19:52] <+Thomzzz> yep this looks like a videogame alright
[2:19:53] <RyuuAoi> We JPN tonite
[2:19:56] <SolsticeZro> can't you just teleport across the map, wasn't that a thing?
[2:19:57] <mattynezz> @godzookylives Less of the battlefield management, much better combat, worse side content
[2:19:58] <pixelkenj> crrrrush
[2:19:59] <The_Maddness> but Link is already there... Pat plz
[2:20:02] <redrins> speeeeeen
[2:20:02] <PulverKong> so the KO counter stays put
[2:20:03] <Vaun0x> you cam order other characters to locations on the map pat
[2:20:04] <%PadreHail> Yeah but imagine a locked 30 1080 Witcher 3 on a Nintendo console
[2:20:07] <+EcchiRider> this is how pat would actually fight. Just use his spin dash
[2:20:09] <%PadreHail> And PORTABLE
[2:20:18] <RyuuAoi> Too 4 Eva
[2:20:19] <%SharkMissile> @PatStaresAt This is why orders exist
[2:20:23] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @PadreHail you can - hack your Switch and increase the CPU clock
[2:20:23] <%Aydarkzero> yeah
[2:20:26] <%HunguyTV> most X attack in this game doesnt cancel sprint, which i love
[2:20:30] <%YakumoYomi> @AutechreTwinAphex If Cyberpunk comes to Switch, it'll probably be like Control and RE7 (cloud version)
[2:20:32] <%Aydarkzero> 1080 on handheld would be good
[2:20:33] <RyuuAoi> Roll 4 eve
[2:20:36] <pixelkenj> they walk
[2:20:36] <Saltmeisterr> no
[2:20:38] <+teh_rawk> no
[2:20:38] <PulverKong> nah they walk there
[2:20:38] <kersmushh> they do not
[2:20:38] <Saltmeisterr> no tele
[2:20:41] <Vaun0x> they run
[2:20:43] <mattynezz> They walk
[2:20:46] <%Valdorick> They walk while you're fighting
[2:20:47] <Sokumotanaka> @PatStaresAt You can order your other team memebrs to do things
[2:20:50] <%Aydarkzero> if the pro even is portable still
[2:20:52] <+abrupt_abe> No but with proper ordering you won't have to move around yourself
[2:20:53] <pixelkenj> its for positioning while you play someone elsewhere
[2:20:54] <The_Maddness> no, but they'll run there while you do other stuff
[2:20:54] <%Valdorick> so when you were on Link, he woulda been closer
[2:20:54] <PulverKong> and then they just stand there and do zero damage unless you control them
[2:20:55] <%RealThiele> screw switching characters to be closer to objectives
[2:20:59] <The_Maddness> also LINK IS ALREADY THERE
[2:21:03] <Sokumotanaka> no but it helps
[2:21:08] <Vaun0x> order them WHILE youre doing the thing pat
[2:21:09] <RyuuAoi> @patstaresat Sooooo.....what's the disadvantages of not rolling?
[2:21:12] <%SharkMissile> Oh, that's fair, he's cool
[2:21:13] <%Aydarkzero> Link on standby :)
[2:21:16] <kersmushh> you go to place 1 and tell other person to go to place 2
[2:21:17] <+Take_2_shots> Da Roook
[2:21:21] <%Aydarkzero> is Daruk your favorite?
[2:21:23] <%Buzzard42> darúk
[2:21:24] <+Ancopro> Derek
[2:21:25] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @YakumoYomi I imagine streaming entire games would be completely terrible on Switch due to WiFi
[2:21:25] <pixelkenj> there are no other characters to play as, only Daruk
[2:21:26] <%Calenrow> Calenrow subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! just tuned in, hope hyrule warriors has been fun
[2:21:27] <%Buzzard42> not dáruk
[2:21:31] <kersmushh> and then when you're done at place 1, your guy is already at place 2
[2:21:32] <%Buzzard42> Derek
[2:21:34] <TheDrown> Da Rule
[2:21:36] <kersmushh> and you don't have to walkj there
[2:21:37] <kersmushh> *walk
[2:21:39] <Vaun0x> ORB VS ORB
[2:21:39] <Sokumotanaka> DA-RUK
[2:21:40] <%Aydarkzero> yeah i suppose so
[2:21:41] <Ralfclogs> He round he roll
[2:21:41] <%Buzzard42> it's Derek
[2:21:42] <PulverKong> @RyuuAoi doesn't kill the monsters you roll over. aka KO counter doesn't move
[2:21:44] <Saltmeisterr> ROCK
[2:21:47] <%Aydarkzero> lava golem
[2:21:50] <%KineKithZen> Literally a rock
[2:21:50] <Zebroneath> Eat him!
[2:21:51] <%Trenr> when fish girl
[2:21:51] <pixelkenj> rock, meet big rock
[2:21:55] <+Take_2_shots> Da Ruk
[2:21:56] <%Valdorick> Are you ready to ROCK!?
[2:21:57] <%RealThiele> the charge ball hits his weak point from the ground LUL
[2:22:01] <mattynezz> Bombs
[2:22:04] <%patriotrenegade> wow, rocks
[2:22:04] <RyuuAoi> @pulverkong True. just a knock down.
[2:22:08] <mattynezz> Blow up his arms
[2:22:10] <%PadreHail> Daddy Daruk
[2:22:11] <%enward_hardar> drop your shield pat
[2:22:14] <The_Maddness> hes a rock EAT HIM
[2:22:17] <%walternatorz> use the echo, pat
[2:22:17] <%Aydarkzero> i remember these being really annoying b/c you had to freeze them
[2:22:18] <RyuuAoi> When BOTW fighter? woolieDATTEBAYO
[2:22:30] <%walternatorz> defeat Titan
[2:22:40] <%xXjuffelXx> can you get on top of him and hit the rock
[2:22:45] <%Valdorick> HP at risk
[2:22:47] <PulverKong> if you hit the thing on his back the shield goes poof very fast
[2:22:47] <RyuuAoi> Okay, Pat needs to die to legitimize this game!
[2:23:01] <The_Maddness> hit the weak point rock
[2:23:12] <%Aydarkzero> do it again PogChamp
[2:23:20] <%KineKithZen> Take more vuln stacks
[2:23:27] <%Aydarkzero> okay thats kind of funny
[2:23:42] <+teh_rawk> i like how tiny the rod is in daruk's hand
[2:23:42] <%Aydarkzero> him wielding the elemental rod
[2:23:45] <%walternatorz> congrats on beating titan (unreal)
[2:23:48] <mattynezz> Blow up its arms with bombs and you can jump on its back for free damage
[2:23:53] <PulverKong> buthin to it
[2:24:01] <%enward_hardar> you. did it
[2:24:01] <%RealThiele> cool guy rock crush
[2:24:02] <Vaun0x> They change as you progress i think
[2:24:05] <Zeikier> bow down overdweller, etc
[2:24:09] <mattynezz> 2H weapon, THAT ROCKS
[2:24:12] <%Buzzard42> I forget, did Pat like the original Hyrule Warriors
[2:24:14] <%Nobrev> wait did pat never pick up the ice rod in the mission where you get the rods
[2:24:23] <mattynezz> Wrong way pat
[2:24:23] <%PadreHail> Move your other characters to minibosses
[2:24:24] <Kain5707> @PatStaresAt Garik
[2:24:25] <Shwepie> Just don't want to keep playing Daruk.
[2:24:25] <mattynezz> Other Way
[2:24:26] <%KineKithZen> Man he is just Titan
[2:24:27] <%PadreHail> Like Moblins
[2:24:32] <%PadreHail> And Wizzaros
[2:24:33] <Darkfire346> keep rollin rollin rollin
[2:24:40] <%xXjuffelXx> You can move them and change when they get there?
[2:24:42] <%Valdorick> Its for if the mission goes "Hey, play this guy, jackass", then you could give an order for the character you're not playing to move to where you were trying to go anyway.
[2:24:43] <PulverKong> Rollin over our friends
[2:24:45] <pixelkenj> its not too important right now
[2:24:51] <%PadreHail> Otherwise they will literally stare into space
[2:24:55] <PulverKong> Rollin like Henry Rollins
[2:25:03] <Sokumotanaka> You move the other characters so they can get places when you need to move to different places and defend them @PatStaresAt
[2:25:04] <%TheBensonator_> FRED DURSTIN' IT
[2:25:17] <+Caidezes> ?????
[2:25:19] <The_Maddness> they'l still help
[2:25:21] <kersmushh> yeah but you might not have that choice later
[2:25:24] <pixelkenj> use the map to order the other units into a time out cornere
[2:25:30] <+TenguGemini> daruk is pretty neat
[2:25:36] <%RealThiele> the x bounce moves you faster than straight rolling as well
[2:25:42] <%Aydarkzero> my guess is you'll eventually need backup right?
[2:25:45] <Forester_Skippy> later misions will have to make you do em to capture 2 difrent points i na set time for example
[2:25:46] <%PadreHail> The Orders mechanics are literally there to clear shit you can't easily get to right away without quick swapping characters
[2:25:47] <PulverKong> Later in the game the maps get so big you literally can't win without the ordering
[2:25:55] <%PadreHail> And the AI automatically aggros enemies
[2:26:06] <pixelkenj> Pat's going for Daruk% you guys
[2:26:07] <+Take_2_shots> Too hot
[2:26:12] <Sokumotanaka> Some missions seperate you behind doors and stuff so it's just for future reference
[2:26:13] <%Garthunox> Too Hot
[2:26:16] <%RealThiele> LUL
[2:26:32] <+TenguGemini> daruk has basically the best bomb in the game imo
[2:26:39] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt daruk's guard is fully invincible btw
[2:26:47] <+TenguGemini> or at least my favorite
[2:26:50] <%RealThiele> miphas bomb is pretty amazing
[2:26:52] <+WorldsBestPanda> Has anybody made the, "Wow, I didn't know you could play as Pat!" joke yet ?
[2:27:01] <PulverKong> They're fine unless the alert starts whining that they need help
[2:27:02] <%Valdorick> In later missions, you can also order them to defend outposts and the like, or just tell them to follow you around and have a Frame killing Possé
[2:27:04] <Frade> ^
[2:27:08] <Saltmeisterr> mipha's bombs are insane
[2:27:18] <%PadreHail> Urbosa has so much fucking tech though
[2:27:21] <Alzero83> Pat likes the Gorons cause he is a goron
[2:27:23] <%PadreHail> And Revali is NUTS
[2:27:27] <+Aggro_Will> @WorldsBestPanda Daruk doesn't look like Pat! He has hair!
[2:27:27] <%JohnAtDawn> Link is that yellow arrow that 's not moving from the starting area
[2:27:35] <%Caped_Eggy> Wait is this dynasty legend zelda?
[2:27:49] <PulverKong> i agree with revali..but urbose you gotta stand still and charge the sword..standing still doesnt work for me in this
[2:27:49] <redrins> @Caped_Eggy yes
[2:27:49] <robotman37> yes
[2:27:51] <pixelkenj> daruk already did all the work
[2:27:52] <%RealThiele> yea warriors botw
[2:27:54] <%Trenr> basically yes
[2:28:01] <%aSleepySkelly> aSleepySkelly subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! 
[2:28:04] <%Caped_Eggy> LUL
[2:28:14] <%Trenr> so was the first one but this looks much better
[2:28:16] <%RealThiele> they handled it
[2:28:18] <PulverKong> Dynasty Breath
[2:28:21] <%Valdorick> Its just too early in the game for it to be of use. It'll make sense later.
[2:28:22] <+Promessa_EX> whatever just play till it becomes necessary i guess
[2:28:31] <robotman37> till this day I still dispise revali
[2:28:31] <%PadreHail> @patstaresat fun fact if you equip Link with a longsword or a spear his entire moveset changes according to those weapons
[2:28:32] <pixelkenj> Unit will be at Point B by the time you're done with Point A
[2:28:32] <+Take_2_shots> Too hot
[2:28:41] <PulverKong> The evil boss lady doesn't have huge tits in this one though
[2:28:51] <+Aggro_Will> Outposts in this game really just feel a lot less relevant than in Hyrule Warriors.
[2:28:54] <+Ancopro> basically spread people wherever so you can teleport across the map easy.
[2:28:55] <+HimakiLuvsU> WE GOT ALL THE WARRIORSSSSS
[2:29:08] <Zeikier> everybody's here?
[2:29:12] <@Mechz71> @PatStaresAt You don't get it now but you'll get it when there's a big map with bosses/points all over the map with a time limit in place or you lose
[2:29:12] <kersmushh> YOU can teleport
[2:29:12] <Fear_Ranjer> YO HYRULE WARRIORS
[2:29:13] <mattynezz> Nah, anyone can trigger any cut-scene
[2:29:16] <kersmushh> the warriors can't
[2:29:16] <+Ancopro> by switchnig character i mean my bad
[2:29:17] <PulverKong> Yeah usually the maps you unlock heroes in has some mechanics for that hero only
[2:29:18] <Saltmeisterr> when u swap characters
[2:29:18] <redrins> when you change chars yes
[2:29:19] <%GG_sensay> teleport as in switch to them
[2:29:19] <mattynezz> By switching charactersd pat
[2:29:19] <Vaun0x> oml pat LUL
[2:29:22] <%Trenr> I assume "teleport" as in switch characters
[2:29:23] <Monkeyweed21> by switching characters
[2:29:24] <%RealThiele> by swapping to the caracter in that location they are missing the point
[2:29:25] <%mostbrokenrobo> Is this Pat's "BABA IS YOU" moment?
[2:29:27] <+Ancopro> right
[2:29:27] <%Valdorick> Well, you the player controlling it can, via swapping, yes.
[2:29:29] <%Daxalog> BABA cannot teleport. But you can
[2:29:31] <pixelkenj> there is only daruk
[2:29:31] <+HimakiLuvsU> YO ALL THE HYRULE WARRIORS
[2:29:33] <%iosephe> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:29:34] <kersmushh> there are timed missions
[2:29:35] <%Nobrev> baba is you not you is baba
[2:29:39] <+Promessa_EX> then whatever
[2:29:41] <%Rlexp> fucker you have to switch characters it's a warriors game
[2:29:42] <kersmushh> sometimes you don't have time to run across the map
[2:29:44] <pixelkenj> Daruk has to capture all the bases
[2:29:44] <%TheBensonator_> DED
[2:29:45] <+Take_2_shots> Too hot
[2:29:47] <%PadreHail> Pat we're saying you can COMMAND the AI to move to a spot where enemies are
[2:29:47] <%LeiaSkynoober> It's just for minmaxing time Pat tbh
[2:29:50] <+HimakiLuvsU> WE GOT THE SHEIKAH
[2:29:52] <%LeiaSkynoober> Chat's being goofy
[2:29:53] <+ZeldaAssassiin> It's just to save time. When you had the 3 outposts to take, you can send 2 to their own outpost while you take one, then switch characters and not have to travel in between
[2:29:54] <+durgaaz> So you can do things like defend 2 bases simultaneously across the map
[2:29:56] <+HimakiLuvsU> WE GOT ZELDAA
[2:29:56] <kersmushh> but as long as you know how to do it, you're fine
[2:29:58] <$spardanwarrior> Then you better get used to hauling your ass across the map at a moments notice
[2:29:59] <KaironFortressKnight> Poor Goron Captain
[2:30:00] <+HimakiLuvsU> WE GOT LINK
[2:30:02] <%Aydarkzero> Goron Captain PogChamp
[2:30:02] <+Promessa_EX> let pat hit game overs
[2:30:04] <Shwepie> But Daruk ceases to be!
[2:30:11] <+HimakiLuvsU> WE GOT DODGE CANCELS
[2:30:11] <%RealThiele> pebble army
[2:30:28] <KaironFortressKnight> Ganbare Goron Captain
[2:30:32] <pixelkenj> Daruk Warrirors: Age of Daruk
[2:30:32] <Vaun0x> I agree let pat suffer
[2:30:34] <Fear_Ranjer> God he IS
[2:30:40] <+Ancopro> gorons be basically
[2:30:57] <Forester_Skippy> darukamania?
[2:30:59] <Alzero83> Gorons are terrrible
[2:31:00] <overlord_nico> That’s gorons in a nutshell
[2:31:03] <%Valdorick> Remember in Twilight Princess, when their entire hat was being Sumo?
[2:31:05] <+pectusumbra> alright, gotta get some rest, this game seems fun, will keep it in mind, good night!
[2:31:06] <Fear_Ranjer> Aren't they *just* a race of sumo wrestlers
[2:31:08] <Vaun0x> nice camera
[2:31:10] <mattynezz> @PatStaresAt If you have any plans to play this game for real, kill almost every single enemy in a map, you will need the materials

[2:31:20] <%PadreHail> Like if you are across the map and you're playing as Link, but Impa isn't doing anything but flicking the bean on the battlefield with her kunai, you can go into the menu and order her to go attack a miniboss like a Wizzrobe or a Moblin so you don't have to deal with them later or come back to them as they have like half a health bar

[2:56:31] <%Dakuu75> frame rate can't handlle the THICC
[2:56:31] <dinnydanny777> The coolness murdered the framerate
[2:56:33] <+rabidclone> "oh no the framerate" Switch in a nutshell as of late

[2:56:44] <%YakumoYomi> Urbosa's musou attack is the frame rate killer
[2:56:45] <%linSP> WRONG MOVE
[2:56:51] <Saltmeisterr> STASIS

[2:56:53] <%SFdvus> Calamity trigger
[2:56:54] <+Ancopro> u did red
[2:56:55] <+Take_2_shots> Up not down
[2:56:55] <Cdjgamer> statis not magnet
[2:56:58] <+OhioNitsud> at this point you just gotta accept the frame rate
[2:56:58] <%Nobrev> you used magnesis instead of stasis
[2:57:01] <mattynezz> STASIS, not MAGNESIS
[2:57:02] <$spardanwarrior> It wanted time stop, not magnet
[2:57:05] <+durgaaz> you keep using magnet instead of stasis
[2:57:08] <%someyounguy1> oh its urbosa, now i care
[2:57:09] <%blaggablag> Would you rather framerate or your dong flop out?
[2:57:09] <crimsonsaens> Wrong rune
[2:57:16] <Cdjgamer> her furry rush is really good
[2:57:20] <Vaun0x> you can only insta charge if you dont already have 4 bars

[2:58:45] <pixelkenj> gief hasnt been the same since he saw the un oh stinky
[2:58:46] <mattynezz> She also charges gauge just from doing damage
[2:58:48] <%Nobrev> mipha has a spear
[2:58:48] <+Take_2_shots> That's the Fish lady
[2:58:49] <Saltmeisterr> nah thats mipha
[2:58:51] <redrins> her weapon was always a scimitar
[2:58:51] <+AbsoluteX3r0> She had that in game
[2:58:53] <%skizzuto> Nah Mipha has the spear
[2:58:55] <$Artoo_The_Me> @patstaresat she can parry
[2:58:56] <Sokumotanaka> she always had the sword
[2:58:56] <AdmiralButtloaf> its her canonical weapon
[2:58:57] <%Valdorick> Those are her weapons from the game, yeah
[2:58:58] <+chiazam> You forgot her weapons didn't you
[2:58:59] <+teh_rawk> mipha has spear
[2:58:59] <Cdjgamer> mipha is spear
[2:58:59] <%tank7013> She can parry btw
[2:59:00] <%AzureGale> *hic*
[2:59:01] <%arancet> mipha is trident, close enough
[2:59:01] <kersmushh> urbosa's weapon in botw was a bigass scimitar
[2:59:01] <Saltmeisterr> mipha is the spear lady
[2:59:01] <+Pookiedaexzile> Wow Pat
[2:59:02] <crimsonsaens> Mipha has spear
[2:59:03] <%linSP> the fish people are spears
[2:59:05] <mattynezz> HLots of dudes have spears
[2:59:08] <Thalchampz> she would look cool with a spear
[2:59:08] <+Pookiedaexzile> You saying they all look alike
[2:59:08] <pixelkenj> the weird things is how Short Urbosa is compared to normal Gerudo
[2:59:13] <+durgaaz> think about the sacred weapons from BotW.
[2:59:16] <+shradke> why isn’t she wearing the dorky electric helmet
[2:59:27] <+chiazam> That's hot
[2:59:37] <mattynezz> You can dodge cancel most iPad attacks if you want, and you usually do for Stasis
[2:59:42] <%Valdorick> I hope the dorky helm is a cosmetic item.
[2:59:46] <%RealThiele> even her calves are hot
[2:59:47] <Saltmeisterr> check out here bombs pat
[3:00:02] <Fear_Ranjer> I think it's just a cosmetic item for link
[3:00:02] <+shradke> Is this literally the botw map?
[3:00:03] <Vaun0x> ohbheah her bomb rune is sick
[3:00:23] <Saltmeisterr> she's parries the bomb to launch herself
[3:00:25] <Vaun0x> @shradke they all are, basically
[3:00:25] <%bevyrage> i legit think the helmet is intended to just be a mcguffin in order for smol to wear like midna's totem crown
[3:00:25] <AdmiralButtloaf> Urbosa is surprisingly graceful
[3:00:27] <Cdjgamer> her bomb makes here do air attack
[3:00:29] <Saltmeisterr> its the coolest
[3:00:30] <Fear_Ranjer> Just a straight up lightning beam
[3:00:30] <%linSP> the zapping system
[3:00:33] <SolsticeZro> monkaS
[3:00:36] <kersmushh> if you hit "right" when you're looking at the move list, it tells you how the runes work @PatStaresAt
[3:00:43] <%YakumoYomi> @shradke I don't know if it's exactly the same, but it's very similar

[3:00:46] <$Artoo_The_Me> @linsp LUL
[3:00:47] <dinnydanny777> Does she parry the bomb???
[3:00:48] <+Take_2_shots> Does Sheathing his sword restore some lightning?
[3:00:49] <%luckysteak> @patstaresat using stasis when their weakness gauge is up gives you more time to attack when weak!
[3:00:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> food
[3:00:52] <dinnydanny777> That's sick LUL
[3:00:53] <bigtitsmagree> It's just in slomotion Kappa

[3:00:57] <%AzureGale> Did someone smear meat on the wall
[3:00:58] <pixelkenj> he wants the sodium in the rock
[3:00:59] <Sokumotanaka> The wall mustard
[3:01:03] <+Take_2_shots> Sheathing her sword rather?
[3:01:17] <+chiazam> Wait why can you use Cryosis in the Desert LMFAO
[3:01:18] <%RealThiele> you time a button spark or charge to get power back
[3:01:22] <KaironFortressKnight> why do they sound like barking dogs
[3:01:24] <Cdjgamer> bombs for this part
[3:01:29] <AdmiralButtloaf> make some noise!

[3:04:34] <%Redpointshine> I really could have sworn that Urbosa was taller
[3:04:38] <%xbalmorax> I didn't know you could tell characters where to go. Can you do that in other Warriors games or is that new?
[3:04:40] <R3c0n31> so like how much of population is literally being exterminated in this game?
[3:04:40] <Vaun0x> btw fully drain the lighting gauge to get the quick charge prompt at the end
[3:04:42] <mattynezz> Wrong way
[3:04:42] <%RealThiele> LUL

[3:04:55] <%Clarke1010> Can you play this without playing Botw?
[3:04:57] <Vaun0x> @r3c0n31 all of it.
[3:04:59] <AdmiralButtloaf> absolute control of electricity is broken af
[3:05:01] <%Nobrev> L3 to make minimap zoom out
[3:05:06] <+Pookiedaexzile> No she's the Thitth

[3:05:18] <Vaun0x> lyou physically can yes
[3:05:22] <$Artoo_The_Me> @clarke1010 Kappa
[3:05:24] <%Clarke1010> Oh perfect! Thank you Pat
[3:05:25] <The_Maddness> thats the beauty of being a prequel
[3:05:26] <%ZephynM> I heard this game is a prequel to Breath of the Wild
[3:05:30] <%someyounguy1> this game is an add for botw and botw is an ad for this
[3:05:31] <T_Sasquatch> Sigh why did nintendo have to have such banger exclusives
[3:05:32] <%xXjuffelXx> Not even canon
[3:05:48] <%Mr_Pylon> something about a ninja swarm is really funny to me
[3:05:50] <%bigboyeggo> dang i missed the first 3 hours of the stream FeelsBadMan
[3:05:51] <+SinisterBroccoli> is link fun to play?
[3:05:53] <Fear_Ranjer> if you wanna know the setting and characters i'd say play BOTW first
[3:05:56] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Exclusives" Right,
[3:06:00] <%xbalmorax> Give 'em the ol' dick twist
[3:06:03] <%Clarke1010> I really want to play the original HW, but this one came out but I haven't played BOTW
[3:06:03] <Vaun0x> yeah, why do all the anti consumer companies have such good games
[3:06:10] <@PlagueOfGripes> I can't remember if Pat has wands yet or not
[3:06:21] <Saltmeisterr> he does plague
[3:06:22] <$Artoo_The_Me> @plagueofgripes He do
[3:06:27] <Vaun0x> @plagueofgripes hes just missing ice wand
[3:06:32] <Saltmeisterr> ice wand
[3:06:34] <kersmushh> there's ice, too
[3:06:35] <The_Maddness> The ice one
[3:06:35] <+shradke> Good thing botw story is simple as fuck and has 3 major plot points
[3:06:38] <%Clarke1010> DQ Warriors is a good one.
[3:06:38] <%Caped_Eggy> Sengoku Basara
[3:06:39] <%bigboyeggo> @Clarke1010 the story sorta explains what's going on but it'll make way more sense if you've played botw
[3:06:39] <%Garthunox> you mean pirate warriors?
[3:06:40] <%bread_assassin> Like PErsona 5 Strikers?
[3:06:44] <@PlagueOfGripes> your aim with them is awful though
[3:06:45] <%Nobrev> there was an ice wand in the same mission you got the other ones
[3:06:47] <%arancet> ive barely used the wands, they feel meh
[3:06:47] <mattynezz> You get an Ice one, I don't know if you MISSED it though
[3:06:48] <kersmushh> you didn't pick it up
[3:06:50] <+OhioNitsud> are they arfing when they get hit?
[3:06:51] <kersmushh> you ran away from it
[3:06:51] <The_Maddness> Pat found a way
[3:06:54] <KaironFortressKnight> Sengoku Basara is so fucking fun man
[3:06:58] <@PlagueOfGripes> you Arin'ed the mission

[3:07:11] <+soflicar> no you will
[3:07:11] <mattynezz> No, it's fine
[3:07:12] <kersmushh> you can replay the mission if you gotta
[3:07:17] <%RealThiele> no you can get it
[3:07:17] <Fear_Ranjer> No you just need an ice wizzrobe
[3:07:18] <Saltmeisterr> wizzrobes drop wands
[3:07:20] <%linSP> youll find an ice wizrobe later
[3:07:22] <kersmushh> but you might also get it when you kill the next ice wizrobe
[3:07:24] <Vaun0x> just find any ice wozzrobe any time
[3:07:25] <+Ancopro> itll show up again
[3:07:25] <+Pookiedaexzile> You've only been to thicc hoe land, Snow hoe land is later
[3:07:30] <$spardanwarrior> Just find an ice wizrobe
[3:07:37] <%Axellogic> incite pat zetsubou
[3:07:40] <Kain5707> this game on Hard is a fucking nightmare sometimes
[3:07:42] <Forester_Skippy> its fine you need to collect em from the wizzrobes of that element
[3:07:44] <dinnydanny777> Ravioli is a snow hoe
[3:07:49] <mattynezz> @PatStaresAt Impa can lay down all 3 runes at once
[3:07:51] <The_Maddness> Impa is DPS Demon
[3:07:51] <+Take_2_shots> From what I understand you want to manually get all the chests because you don't get those rewards automatically.
[3:07:53] <%bigboyeggo> find a horrifying flying goblin
[3:07:54] <Vaun0x> @kain5707 hard mode gang
[3:07:56] <%Nobrev> the mission that introduced the rods had all 3 guys. chat dum

[3:08:10] <Fear_Ranjer> Revali is a piece of shit and we love him for it
[3:08:12] <Vaun0x> @take_2_shots you DO get them automatically
[3:08:18] <Kain5707> @Vaun0x im on the final mission and i want to die already

[3:09:08] <%linSP> defeat the orb man!
[3:09:10] <Fear_Ranjer> Pat you do technically start with all rods, you're just getting charges for them
[3:09:17] <%HunguyTV> you get one on first ice wizzrobe then refill after
[3:09:23] <crimsonsaens> You'll get one later, probably
[3:09:28] <+SinisterBroccoli> This game doesn't include Sidon so it's takes off a whole point for me

[3:18:22] <fubar202> lol
[3:18:22] <peachy996> Watch some Picard
[3:18:23] <%pixelkenj> find a stark trek episode with Cyber Punks
[3:18:24] <%Nobrev> the thing egg was pointing at was a training room to test moves @PatStaresAt
[3:18:26] <Hyperfludd> there's a training room
[3:18:26] <%bigboyeggo> this game actually gets shockingly difficult later in the campaign, even on easier difficulties
[3:18:28] <%RetroCop87> Can we watch too?
[3:18:31] <%bigboyeggo> like it gets REALLY hard
[3:18:36] <@commanderclaw> We'll watch some Star Trek and eat some ice cream
[3:18:39] <%Clarke1010> Make sure to watch Pat's favorite Star Trek. Deep Space Nine.
[3:18:41] <@commanderclaw> And then we can drink Egg Nog
[3:18:42] <%ShaneWhite> Its been a while
[3:18:42] <%ShovelJustice21> what happened with cyberpunk?
[3:18:42] <$Artoo_The_Me> Paige is pretty cool ya know?

[3:18:49] <$Cthulos> F Picard the show
[3:18:49] <%BinaryFireball> @PatStaresAt can I make the argument that Yakuza 7 is a lot better open world game than 2077? Because it sure feels that way
[3:18:54] <Vaun0x> pat try using ur eyeholes
[3:18:55] <$Cthulos> It suxks
[3:18:58] <Jnkolm> rushong ahead by replaying the first stage
