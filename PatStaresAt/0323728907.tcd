[0:26:49] <b1gboss007> Play co-Op
[0:26:50] <%Sotetsu> Pat, I hope you'll give Pathfinder Kingmaker a try. It is the best crpg I've played in a looooong time.
[0:26:50] <AlasterAngelo> i turned away and he already won? wow
[0:26:50] <+OUTheTeam> I can’r believe I’m thinking of buying a COD Blops game, and for BR no less
[0:26:57] <%laserbeaming> You playing on controller? you can always blame that
[0:26:59] <CertainlySyrix> Are you playing this on PC or PS4?
[0:26:59] <eldritchmoeblob> SIT REP WE ARE OSCAR MIKE TO THE TANGO OVER
[0:27:00] <element_of_loyalty> Pat is Zap Rowsdower
[0:27:03] <+Ell1ot> Ask Paige to win for you
[0:27:04] <+imextremelymanly> go to the asylum
[0:27:05] <Gutslinger> Ugh.. My internet is too slow to even watch the stream in 160p. Guess I'll have to stick to watching the Vods.
[0:27:05] <Run44forrest> pat play some deathmatch
[0:27:06] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> ps4
[0:27:06] <+KrippSubBot> so you're not good with guns that require you to aim??
[0:27:07] <HyraFukit> Pat is here for sword play, but stuck with guns
[0:27:09] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @sotetsu like the game was able to work eventually but at that point Pat put up a straw poll and Black Ops won. About 600 people left as he switched too.
[0:27:12] <+NiktenKing> PS4
[0:27:13] <b1gboss007> I think ps4
[0:27:32] <CertainlySyrix> thank christ. So Pat is just bad then
[0:27:35] <+graffitisamurai> I would totally buy this game if SC 6 and RDR2 weren't coming out right after the other
[0:27:35] <%IMDRanged> Pat needs the earphones Max uses.

[0:33:39] <Flyrant> the story is shoot bang
[0:33:42] <eldritchmoeblob> the real blackout was the friends we made along the way
[0:33:43] <+mistersokar> @Lysdexic9541 so is this the gritty reboot?
[0:33:45] <%Divryne> The story is that the Cod Blops has hidden the Blackout and all the Spec Ops need to find it to become the ultimate Black Ops.
[0:33:45] <element_of_loyalty> YER HIT PAT YER BLEEDIN
[0:33:46] <+imextremelymanly> there is somewhat of a story if you go through training
[0:33:50] <HyraFukit> You cant call for a black out as a white man
[0:33:52] <+GuelermeDias> blackout is actually a dating sim
[0:33:55] <b1gboss007> Humanity was the real godzilla all along
[0:33:56] <%IMDRanged> Story is PUBG sucks

[0:34:16] <element_of_loyalty> wait
[0:34:17] <+TheKillerStove> @mistersokar for real though its basically a crisis on infinite earths scenario. All of the Codblops multiverse is collapsing on itself, both in time and space
[0:34:18] <+FrostMass22> Remember when in Advanced Warfare the campaign was about stopping Kevin Spacey from molesting children?
[0:34:18] <aiyobro> why?/
[0:34:21] <+mistersokar> Ok, so basically Dick Cheney's birthday party or something?
[0:34:22] <ape_hawk> the story is that Pubg made a lot of money and activision wants that money
[0:34:22] <%DedlokPM> The treasure was the blackout that we made on the way. teenJOY

[0:35:46] <+Ell1ot> Did a plane just land? Why is Paige clapping?
[0:35:46] <+mistersokar> is the murder the reason her ovaries are on?

[0:37:19] <+supasonix> @Sotetsu unfortunately not, but it does require you to know the gun really well
[0:37:19] <+NiktenKing> Using the grapple gun to woosh around the map feels great
