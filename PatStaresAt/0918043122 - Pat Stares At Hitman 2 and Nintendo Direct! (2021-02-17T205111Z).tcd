[0:02:07] <+carfar_farcar> Hey man it's fine, it's not like it's your job or anything right?

[0:02:50] <%Frost_Quill> I wonder if Toby Fox is the kinda guy to release a trailer randomly in a Nintendo Direct now that Undertale and Deltarune is popular in Japan.
[0:02:53] <%BoxNavy> do it EleGiggle
[0:02:53] <plushy__poo> have you tried turning it off and then back on again?
[0:02:55] <%coward_man> I assume there is a mini fridge in Paige's office with a jar of pickles in at all times
[0:02:56] <%yet_another_brony> did we miss any donos during the crash?
[0:02:59] <GDM117> pat how much does this work now?
[0:03:00] <%maenos2> it all returns to nothing

[0:07:26] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah I'll use a guide you can't stop me
[0:07:26] <Daxalog> An important part of RPG's is self expression. Its why I hate Underrail.
[0:07:30] <%BoxNavy> this this this this SourPls
[0:07:31] <BoomerxDoomer> @PatStaresAt do u play nioh 2 with a guide
[0:07:32] <%holydeviant1> Path of Exile s fine until you get to like level 50 and then suddenly if you're not a good build it gets REALLY hard
[0:07:35] <oniwahoo> @carfar_farcar Hard to not take your work home with you, when it's already there all the time
[0:07:41] <%Monkeyweed21> just use a bad build 4head
[0:07:44] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm using a guide for P5 come at me
[0:07:50] <%valkuma> @holydeviant1 it doesnt get hard until after the campaign
[0:07:51] <%chambatron> pat is strem nintendo yes ok
[0:07:52] <%hotcarl6872> i like general guidelines and not rails that tell me exactly what to do
[0:07:54] <%ospreyworks> Hm. Is it the GPU driver crashing and that triggers OBS to die, or is it Nvidia just causing OBS to stop working?
[0:07:55] <%radda343> goblins are upset
[0:08:00] <%emperordread> Perscriptive?
[0:08:01] <%shurtal> Gief out here, soundin like an underwater Darth Vader, i love him
[0:08:02] <rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt i know its unlikely but whit crash 4s new platform options a tiny glimmer still exists of crash characters appearing in smash
[0:08:05] <%ospreyworks> Wonder if it's a faulty GPU
[0:08:14] <peyodogo> i'm playing it right now and you're exactly correct lmao, love it but also holy shit
[0:08:18] <%ChungusQuest> choice paralysis
[0:08:29] <%Monkeyweed21> just use a shitty build 4head
[0:08:32] <%hotcarl6872> that's fair
[0:08:37] <+carfar_farcar> @oniwahoo Yes, as well as no co-workers around you to banter with.
[0:08:38] <Zombrocom> You really don't need to follow a strict guide like that for POE. You can just get used to it and figure things out.
[0:08:38] <%AncelDeLambert> hence why such games NEED free respecs

[0:10:37] <%justcallmebobplease> What was that about Lab Zero, Pat?
[0:10:38] <%greasypete00> lasagna is a form of player expression
[0:10:41] <%orpleborple> layered like ogres
[0:10:42] <%ÏΩîÏΩîÍæ∏Îùº> But the top layer on lasagna always has cheese
[0:10:43] <GDM117> infinite lasagna stacking confirmed
[0:10:46] <%AncelDeLambert> THE TOP LAYER OF CHEESE IS A CRUST, YOU CAN'T JUST STACK!
[0:10:49] <%Ranryu692> real Gs roll in silence like lasagne

[0:14:54] <Rionxgarland> is valheim really that good
[0:14:56] <oniwahoo> Can't wait for it to be a fire emblem character with 2 swords
[0:14:57] <%0rond> 0rond subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 2 month streak! ayo pat have you considered doing a new "road to endwalker" ffxiv guide like you did for shadowbringers? or maybe just a supplementary addendum of what's changed? if nothing else a leveling guide would be appreciated.

[0:15:56] <+BigDumBeak> thats what happened to me with animal crossing, yep
[0:16:05] <Visorak6> Sounds like your friends ditched you to do all the content while you were offline, sorry to hear, happened to me before
[0:16:06] <aero160h> has anyone built a dick monument in valheim yet?
[0:16:06] <TheZearGuy> That‚Äôs about right
[0:16:08] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> reminds me of animal crossing and seeing everyones insane islands
[0:16:12] <%DianaTheAscian> @patstaresat so shame is what made u stop?
[0:16:16] <%Hobojo153> But Pat, that just means you have to be better then them out of spite
[0:16:18] <%anothernameforsnow> oh god that's a massive mood. This shit fucks me up w/minecraft every time.
[0:16:21] <%BoxNavy> dude that happens to me too
[0:16:22] <ergulor> and tnat's why i play terraria solo
[0:16:24] <Zeif00> The town shames
[0:16:25] <%emperordread> Keeping up with the Jones'
[0:16:26] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> yeah thats it
[0:16:27] <mike2hands> awww that's sad
[0:16:27] <toahmes> Always fun when your friends finish the game without you
[0:16:27] <josstil> That‚Äôs just how it is though
[0:16:28] <%super_ej8> I felt that
[0:16:29] <bigshedman> Is this a kind of mind gobulin?
[0:16:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Gut Gud l
[0:16:32] <BlkFlameKami> comparison is the theft of joy
[0:16:33] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[0:16:33] <%RD_nx> the way you described it on the pofvast made me buy it
[0:16:33] <BoneBagMel> oh no, small peepee syndrome
[0:16:33] <ravioli_ronin> I didn‚Äôt even get to like roads in AC
[0:16:35] <%holydeviant1> I have a little hut and a forge and that makes me happy
[0:16:37] <+Veraverse> LUL
[0:16:37] <+guyalex> yeah, i hate joining a friends minecrafter server or whatever and seeing they havent logged in out three weeks and it kills my motivation to do anything
[0:16:37] <%MugenSandan> @patstaresat This is the feeling I have when I open up Facebook and see how much more competent at living all my friends are
[0:16:38] <oniwahoo> My animal crossing town was always shit
[0:16:39] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Awww pat don't be jelly, your fort thing is cool too
[0:16:40] <Ell1ot> that happens with a lot of people.
[0:16:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Git Gud lol
[0:16:42] <%Hobojo153> Spite build past them
[0:16:43] <missingangle> I feel that so hard
[0:16:45] <%DianaTheAscian> kinda werid but okay
[0:16:46] <%anothernameforsnow> Solo Minecraft for me is super cozy but with friends it burns me out suuuper quick.
[0:16:56] <@SSaryn> I can kinda feel that but like.. simplicity is nice anyway.
[0:17:02] <%josstil> Which is why you should only compare yourself to yourself
[0:17:05] <vVAstrAVv> those dragon quest builders 2 islands OOOOOH MAN
[0:17:07] <+OhioNitsud> feeling inadequate in a video game is the worst
[0:17:11] <+Veraverse> I don't get it, but it made me laugh. Thanks Pat
[0:17:11] <+theMrRoboto> theMrRoboto subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Stop comparing your accomplishments to others and maybe that will help with your inferiority complex?
[0:17:12] <tranquilturnip> Pat received eldritch knowledge
[0:17:23] <auraofdawn> I felt that, but I just doubled down on what I was already doing and my island turned out ok
[0:17:26] <%MugenSandan> this feels like a thing that goes far beyond video games
[0:17:28] <+Aleate> And people wonder why I just play shooters otzSAD
[0:17:32] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> thats and oof for sure
[0:17:36] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> *an
[0:17:36] <%baka_sugoi> finding chill games is hard
[0:17:39] <peyodogo> yeah that sucks dude, i get the same thing with speedrunning
[0:17:41] <%dd44dostivei> multiplayer gaming dissolves the power fantasy
[0:17:42] <missingangle> It‚Äôs not fun
[0:17:47] <$realm_forge> The only way to win is to pick a game and build Patropolis. Shining city of only pat
[0:17:57] <%strakillias> That's why you have to host the server yourself to make sure nobody plays ahead
[0:17:57] <+carfar_farcar> Same way I felt when loading up FFIVX again, just can't justify the time sink to catch up
[0:18:01] <BoneBagMel> yes
[0:18:02] <%AncelDeLambert> I see we're talking about Dark Souls psaBougie
[0:18:03] <%Hobojo153> Yes

[0:18:16] <Visorak6> Thats why everyone in my server zoned off their own districts to build stuff
[0:18:18] <@SSaryn> At least in Raft, you can kinda make roles for you and your buddies but yeah I get it.

[0:19:33] <%UvBenServed> Fair
[0:19:34] <%anothernameforsnow> My weirdest mind gobolin with those kinds of games is seeing someone elses shit and being spoiled on what comes in the progression before I got to see it myself

[0:19:59] <SovPho> We don't have salt trucks. We do have sand trucks.
[0:20:00] <+black_pariah> even if they could where would they get the salt
[0:20:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt We know its a thing, its just the toll roads decided not to do it
[0:20:01] <%BoxNavy> i had to walk in black ice one time it was a nightmare
[0:20:03] <%WhereIsWill> black ice will rob you blind!
[0:20:03] <+demon1103> ....i did not hear about that....jesus
[0:20:03] <%Hobojo153> For me it was seeing the fire rolling in fucking balls down power lines
[0:20:05] <%Reveresao> A report was released in 2011 about winter issues and the gov did nothing
[0:20:06] <aero160h> Texas is a wetland, it's infrastructure isn't prepared for hurricanes or ice storms
[0:20:06] <mandjelo> @ScreamLord Thank you

[0:20:18] <%maenos2> can I practice cannibalism
[0:20:19] <%ospreyworks> Yeah, so, the next time someone says climate change is fake, please just smack them.
[0:20:24] <+ReallyBigRocks> Wait do people try running engines indoors to heat their house?
[0:20:24] <+D00msDayDan> we've been without water since monday but we got power and gas so we've been boiling snow
[0:20:26] <%barrakuta371> Black Ice? that bad ACDC album?
[0:20:27] <+abrupt_abe> That already happened sagly
[0:20:27] <%dd44dostivei> that happened to a lady and her daughter
[0:20:31] <+abrupt_abe> sadly
[0:20:32] <%BigHooppaw> I'm supposed to get ice tonight
[0:20:36] <Hanzmolman> The government didn‚Äôt bother to do it
[0:20:41] <+Ominnous> @PatStaresAt for all of Georgia we have 3 snow trucks and all of them are borrowed from other states
[0:20:44] <oniwahoo> Watching Abbot claim the problem is green energy and not preparing for this shit is something
[0:20:46] <$realm_forge> I want to Stay warm by burning down Austin power
[0:20:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> @aero160h actually we are prepared for hurricains but not winter
[0:20:48] <+OhioNitsud> it already happened
[0:20:49] <%BoxNavy> jesus
[0:20:55] <+Kurt_0> Black ice? Is that a rapper
[0:20:57] <Ell1ot> it hailed here a few years ago and it was fun watching the kids scrambling from the bus to get home
[0:21:01] <@SSaryn> It's just so fucking ridiculous how bad Stadia that's the biggest problem.
[0:21:01] <%anothernameforsnow> At least GA isn't getting snow (at least not where I'm at)
[0:21:02] <%Hobojo153> Every time I think it's hit the bottom a new sink hole forms in the bottom of the barrel

[0:21:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> Whos talking?
[0:21:16] <%Frost_Quill> Politicians claiming the problem is windmills and shit is SUPER infuriating.
[0:21:21] <%BigHooppaw> Black ice is that gross scented tree, right?
[0:21:24] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @kurt_0 No its a Rainbow 6 Siege gun skin
[0:21:35] <@SSaryn> My triangle buttons fucked up on mine so kinda fucked there
[0:21:35] <%twistedj3ster> Really? I had a lot of problems

[0:22:18] <@SSaryn> MNK is still totally fine but be aware, positionals is your entire gameplay. So have fun with that.

[0:28:10] <%kyh9> SMTV news?
[0:28:11] <%Monkeyweed21> the new smash character will be a Conker
[0:28:13] <nivlac_555> good idea
[0:28:15] <NitronStreams> possibly
[0:28:15] <+TheEvilOmega> You should buy a Dynex. Those TVs last forever. Sometimes.
[0:28:15] <%Ipsenscastle> oh yeah
[0:28:16] <+TheotherKristian> Maybe?
[0:28:16] <+Veraverse> I don't know what those words mean, but maybe
[0:28:17] <%coward_man> could be that
[0:28:18] <clockworknait1> it looks grainy ngl
[0:28:19] <%BoxNavy> were you using nvenc during your tests?
[0:28:21] <+carfar_farcar> LG OLEDs have had Pixel Shift since 2017. Works really well, I only have slight burn in from rocket league
[0:28:23] <+Delenay> makes sense
[0:28:24] <%hotcarl6872> worth a shot
[0:28:26] <%rytisone> who knows
[0:28:27] <TheAdMerlin> Anything besides Reimu will be a disappointing reveal. Only Reimu will be a strong enough reaction to sate my ginger spite'

[0:28:31] <%Frost_Quill> Haha mechanical words, I know what those mean...
[0:28:34] <+TheotherKristian> Watch, new smash character shall be 2013 Dante
[0:28:35] <%ssjklyco> It's ppossible. Eliminate all you can since before the issue.
[0:28:37] <%DarkNerdShawny> i never had an issue with that encoding but I habe a 1070 not a 3080
[0:28:37] <%BigHooppaw> maybe because you're too epic
[0:28:41] <%JumboCrunchies> PatCam is usually small, so it looks a bit grainy when big.

[0:30:23] <+TheEvilOmega> I was thinking of streaming a tutorial on how to not suck at Call of Duty.
[0:30:25] <+walnutcast> when does pat announce his Nintendo game he's making?

[0:31:11] <%theMrRoboto> wonder what he read but didnt say hmm
[0:31:14] <%Arkfyre> gross spring slush is the worst
[0:31:14] <%Deft_Thought> My favorite snow is the after-snow, where all the dog shit and cat shit starts to thaw out as it gets warmer
[0:31:14] <%BigHooppaw> best xlr audio interface that I won't need a second mortgage for?

[0:31:16] <SovPho> you realize that this time next week it'll be 80 degrees in Texas
[0:31:17] <%Mr_Pylon> An excellent thing for people who don't normally get snow is a good ice scraper for your car.

[0:35:17] <%Wade_Willson> Being apart of the national grid is socialism to them
[0:35:17] <aero160h> Texas wanted to show its independence and also thought about seceding from the union
[0:35:19] <+king_of_beggars> Texas cut all those wires to show that their natural gas resources were large enough to allow full independence to back up all their big talk about secession. Only El Paso still has a connection to the national grid.
[0:35:21] <%BoxNavy> do a tank guide :)
[0:35:23] <theanora1> ERCOT shut down 30 Gigawatts of power generators

[0:35:55] <mortalmanbaby> nintendo direct time???
[0:35:56] <+king_of_beggars> To show they don't need AMerica.
[0:35:56] <DazzlingFuhrer> tl;dr texas is stupid
[0:35:56] <%Frost_Quill> @Dova573 If there's one good thing to come of this, it's that a lot of people are waking up to how bullshit the people in charge are being.
[0:35:58] <%BoxNavy> are we gettin jermaOneguy 'd here?
[0:35:59] <Sunstalker> Because they want to be independent
[0:35:59] <%justcallmebobplease> DO YOU THINK SECESSIONISTS ARE REASONABLE ACTORS?
[0:35:59] <Zeikier> Yeehaw?
[0:36:01] <%theMrRoboto> test
[0:36:01] <%caramelatte1> So Texas is a very silly place then?
[0:36:02] <Visorak6> Because if the government can shut your power off you cant secede pat
[0:36:02] <+corrosivePaladin> texas wanted to show how big their d is
[0:36:02] <%BigHooppaw> spongebob was right, texas is dumb
[0:36:03] <%Ipsenscastle> welp
[0:36:03] <+Dova573> Dumb GOP logic
[0:36:03] <%MrBorisMakarov> BECAUSE YEEHAW NATION BYITSELF
[0:36:03] <mandjelo> Texas has it's own grid. The "national" grid is split in half to different coasts of the country.
[0:36:04] <%holydeviant1> WE ARE BIG STRONG LONE STAR, GO AWAY GUBMENT
[0:36:06] <%vehementvadr> el Paso is rich people texas
[0:36:06] <+carfar_farcar> Because they can be independent of the UNION from cutting their power
[0:36:06] <%slimmixrp> Google us electric interconnection to see a map of it @PatStaresAt
[0:36:06] <%JoshManVGH> They wanted to flex big that they can leave when they want
[0:36:07] <%Anime_Flux> They sure showed Uncle Sam!
[0:36:08] <+Grayhammatter> and now, everyone else is fucked in texas
[0:36:09] <%wembleyttv> I think its the size of the state
[0:36:10] <deviljhojho_> Use your big braine
[0:36:10] <%greasypete00> disconnecting from the rest of the country so they aren't dependant on it
[0:36:10] <AllenDeadman> texas are fucking morons
[0:36:11] <+D00msDayDan> texas wants to pretend like they're big dick independents but can't actually back that up
[0:36:11] <+ReallyBigRocks> If they were to secede then they wouldn't get to use the national grid?
[0:36:11] <+Veraverse> Sad Cowboy noises
[0:36:11] <HorribleHog> can't be independent if you're dependent
[0:36:14] <Sunstalker> Also woohoo, rush limbaugh is dead. PogChamp
[0:36:16] <%MidnightBurst12> add a whole lotta stupid into that equation
[0:36:17] <+Matto424> as someone who lives in texas that sure sounds like texas
[0:36:18] <ravioli_ronin> They think they could be self-sufficient and secede
[0:36:18] <%medusasghost> texas is dumb idk man
[0:36:19] <+b1unkey> northeast blackout 2003
[0:36:20] <+s_xylocalsingles> @PatStaresAt they keep their Power resources only statewide so the Federal Government has no Oversight ; leading to situations like this
[0:36:21] <Zeikier> conservatives are not good at thinking things through and they want their citizens to suffer
[0:36:21] <%CopperTucker> Don't forget that Texan power companies shut down their reactors because it was expensive, and they are figuring out how to pass the costs onto the people to make them pay for it.
[0:36:22] <KidKaiser23> Breaking News: Texas pulls Grenade Pin whilst inside own home
[0:36:23] <%JoshManVGH> but also big Texas Gas gets big money for big monopoly
[0:36:24] <Teyaric> The power was literally left off to make a buck. There was no "grid capacity" involved. It was a managerial decision.
[0:36:25] <+BaeD_JD> yaaaa AMERICA
[0:36:27] <Zeif00> Texas wants to show they have big pp
[0:36:29] <%justcallmebobplease> ...Can we trade secessionists?

[1:35:24] <+REDtheBEAST> Fuck you Luigi!
[1:35:24] <iosephe> Is that not what a Direct is?
[1:35:25] <$SGrim> If they have nothing else to show, I guess.
[1:35:26] <%AtlasMcCoy> No
[1:35:26] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Padding for time.
[1:35:28] <%medusasghost> no but it cute
[1:35:28] <clockworknait1> this means the direct isnt looking good if they have this as filler
[1:35:29] <%FluffiTamamo> Get crushed I wanna see

[1:35:34] <+skyheys> it's an ad pat
[1:35:34] <SweetCuppingCake> I haven‚Äôt touched this game in months :(
[1:35:35] <%ItsYaGirlMaria> that warp pipe is pretty sick tho
[1:35:35] <KidKaiser23> This coulda been a Tweet
[1:35:36] <HorribleHog> Well I mean why not? Where else would they advertise? Steam?
[1:35:36] <%Broand> Oh teleporter
[1:35:36] <zakaraz> no this should be an acnh update video
[1:35:36] <+DGenerator> halfway thru btw
[1:35:36] <thelonechris> That's useful
[1:35:38] <Yung_FckUp> whos mario?
[1:35:38] <ARDM112> It's either this or more spoilers for Outer Wilds, shut up Pat
[1:35:38] <ravioli_ronin> Nooe
[1:35:38] <+akira_chong> @PatStaresAt Nintendo Directs ARE just press releases
[1:35:38] <%GarbageQueenEllie> This whole Direct is just to get the children to scream at their parents to buy this mediocre shit
[1:35:39] <darkbotle> The pipes are dope
[1:35:39] <%emperordread> Where's Waluigi?
[1:35:39] <+snausages_> At least we are going to see Ninja Gaiden soon
[1:35:40] <%takutoots> actualyl warp would be nice
[1:35:40] <%MidnightBurst12> it does when you have nothing else to show
[1:35:41] <%BeardedLuchador> Oh a warp pipe is really cool
[1:35:41] <cardamomo88> just put that in twitter
[1:35:41] <ExileNineteen> isn't the point of your own island to do original, creative shit?
[1:35:41] <%medusasghost> wait i love this
[1:35:41] <ExpressNode> People just hyped this direct up. Of course they were gonna get disappointed
[1:35:41] <peachy996> What else do they have?
[1:35:42] <Zeif00> Pipe actually seems useful tho
[1:35:42] <+Rofiarf> its a nintendo direct, it can be as short or long as they want
[1:35:42] <%Dingalow> Okay! Warp pipes are a GOOD ADDITIONS
[1:35:43] <%MisterRockett> Okay Warp Pipes are like, the real deal
[1:35:43] <+FlubbedPig> It's fine to include this, it just doesn't need to take this long to announce it
[1:35:43] <%pectusumbra> I mean warps in animal crossing seems like a big deal
[1:35:44] <+Kharinite> c'mon nintendo
[1:35:44] <+chicken_danger> DONT YOU LIKE MARIO
[1:35:44] <%twistedj3ster> give Brewster
[1:35:44] <Portal_Operater> That's actual cool.
[1:35:45] <Shwepie> Nintendo Directs are press releases, they just bypass the press.
[1:35:45] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> To be fair, it's not Pat's fault this Direct sucked.
[1:35:46] <%Ghufufin> the equivalent of this meeting could have been an email
[1:35:46] <+rheviel> aren't mario items like a default
[1:35:47] <boti_balint> looks kinda cursed
[1:35:47] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck that pipe is good
[1:35:47] <%greasypete00> moon2W
[1:35:47] <gnarly_memes_bro> yeah this is way more advanced than any corssover stuff in previous games but atill

[2:01:07] <Zaphire_Saucypants> I actually enjoyed Skyward Sword more than BOTW
[2:01:08] <%arcielardor> You got people interested in Swery, so you're right
[2:01:08] <%takutoots> to apologize and be honest

[2:01:18] <dan_g_v> buns is saying the same
[2:01:18] <+OwlLightningMage> That direct was damaging
[2:01:18] <Link232> Do you prefer hearing absolutely nothing like SMT 5 and Bayonetta or "we have nothing new"
[2:01:19] <bob900000> why mention it
[2:01:19] <XenoDandelion> to keep the man children at bay before they send death threats
[2:01:19] <extradopeness> SPLAT 3 BABY LETS GO
[2:01:19] <+OdysseyKnight> BotW2 is just gonna be on a nextgen Switch

[2:01:24] <DeadEyeArrow> Remember when he snapped his fingers and BoTW came into existence?
[2:01:24] <Virokwet> he's there to quell teh hype
[2:01:24] <%BeatBoxersDevMike> to show off the worst zelda game instead
[2:01:24] <+koalaf1ed> could have done nothing and I'd feel the same
[2:01:26] <thelonechris> Where's Metroid?
[2:01:26] <darkbotle> To apologize
[2:01:26] <oniwahoo> He was the only important person they could get to agree to show up
[2:01:27] <SilverSterling5> they could have just shown Skyward Sword....
[2:01:27] <rookeealding> If some games had said that they wouldn't be half as bad
[2:01:27] <HedgehogGames1> SMT V definitely not coming out this year.
[2:01:28] <%MrGuy516> to hype the rerelease of the bad one
[2:01:29] <+Sendaar> I appreciate it more then complete silence for years

[2:01:36] <iosephe> Good question

[2:01:43] <%Dingalow> If they didn't at least mention BotW 2 people would get really angry
[2:01:43] <%Keaton_x> "We know you're excited for Breath of the Wild 2. Here's Skyward Sword again!"
[2:01:43] <+Catpurnicus> or any games that will come out on the pro

[2:02:02] <Shwepie> @PatStaresAt They literally did the same thing for BotW. Said we got nothing to show and game is delayed, so here's Wind Waker HD.
[2:02:02] <+Encrouched> TRIANGLE DEMO
[2:02:04] <%ssjklyco> You lost the bet
[2:02:04] <+Grayhammatter> triangle demo?

[2:02:48] <+akira_chong> @PatStaresAt You shit on people for not saying anything about their game for years all the time. Why is Aonuma coming on to say he's still working on it a bad thing to you?
[2:02:48] <rookeealding> other games would not even give you that. they would just cruchn it and trash it
[2:02:48] <wujak> everything talked about it. you are about the only source that didnt

[2:03:07] <DeadEyeArrow> There are no more smash characters worth adding.
[2:03:10] <%TheDullaMAN> If it makes you feel better, I lost focus after the Smash announcement, so I wasn't listening to the spoiler.
[2:03:11] <BalloniWright> Worst Direct ResidentSleeper
[2:03:11] <bigshedman> @PatStaresAt Play Persona 4 on Switch and find out why [spoiler] commited all those murders

[2:03:15] <%sniffy77> hey pat twilight princess is trending

[2:03:33] <%Arancet> @PatStaresAt the steam description literally says theres a loop
[2:03:33] <%AyotoCorp> @PatStaresAt Would turning the stream on and off again to protect from DMCA be a good idea
[2:03:34] <%BoxNavy> yes
[2:03:34] <SomeOtherNeb> it's probably at the top of the hour
[2:03:34] <AmericanaRed> CLASSIC

[2:10:01] <sweetestbeefs> Listen, ending with splatoon 3 is the absolute weakest thing nintendo coulda done
[2:10:18] <+OwlLightningMage> This be right back animation is more interesting than the direct

[2:10:21] <+Byronic_dreamer> FING3RS does good work

[2:10:55] <TheViltsuZ> I liked Neon White, Ghosts n Goblins, Bravely Default 2, No More Heroes 3, Project Triangle Strategy, Ninja GAIDEN, LEGEND OF MANA
[2:10:55] <+OwlLightningMage> I don't
[2:11:00] <+Prowtellen> If Splatoon 3 will have an actual single player campaign that isn't half assed i could get hyped but i have no CLUE what it will be

[2:31:35] <InXplotch> @PatStaresAt how did you feel about octopath
[2:31:36] <+Grayhammatter> the saltiron wars
[2:31:37] <disflipmat> Holy shit that is Tactics Ogre as fuck
[2:31:38] <OneThousandTomatoes> I hope they can go into the stories more than octopath
[2:31:39] <%kewlmyc> woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY woolieONEGUY
[2:31:43] <%rumtumtugnutz> No it isn‚Äôt, one of those demos is full version and pat is being pat.
[2:31:44] <%PettyFunk> The Bravely team was SUPER responsive to feedback from their first demo and it sounds like that will be the case for this one too!
[2:31:45] <%Ranryu692> Octopath was really good, but it had no central story
[2:31:46] <%chiazam> THIS LOOKS SICK ALREADY
[2:31:47] <+king_of_beggars> Everything was good about Octopath is that it wasn't focused.
[2:31:47] <Profmcstevie> If Square Enix won't make a new Tactics, SQUARE ENIX WILL MAKE ONE....wait
[2:31:48] <+asgard147> This IS Square Enix tho?
[2:31:50] <%Arancet> i hate this games name, and you know theyll keep it this after octopath
[2:31:53] <+Veraverse> I hope the name changes for the best
[2:31:54] <deviljhojho_> octopath gets fucked by the story yeah
[2:31:55] <rcand9> oh god
[2:31:56] <+MosesUnspoken> Triangle Tactics lets go

[2:31:57] <%linSP> Bro there‚Äôs BLOOD
[2:31:57] <clockworknait1> The characters didnt interact with eachother at all!!
[2:31:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Is Paige one guy?
[2:31:58] <+king_of_beggars> Except that it wasn't focused, I mean.
[2:31:59] <%LouieRouie> Triangle Man hates Hitman. They had a fight Triangle wins. Triangle Man.
[2:32:01] <$lotharrio> That IS pretty dire for an RPG
[2:32:02] <ExpressNode> So I wonder if its turn based or round based
[2:32:02] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> but it had 8 stories Kappa
[2:32:03] <%twoto858> No reason to spend so much time with it
[2:32:04] <InXplotch> It definitely was a consequence of how you got to go through the story
[2:32:04] <rcand9> i havent played it is it bad?
[2:32:05] <%Bailey__gaming> War of Salt
[2:32:05] <ThorW> Octopath's gameplay was great, visuals were amazing, sound was fantastic, but the story was NOTHING
[2:32:06] <Sol_Install> octopath has a supee weak main line
[2:32:06] <LordOfThePoultry> story sucked ass
[2:32:08] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[2:32:08] <%Monkeyweed21> its 8 kinda meh stories instead of 1 good story
[2:32:08] <%PettyFunk> It was totally lacking a mainline story and party interaction

[2:35:24] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> gustadolph
[2:35:24] <%DianaTheAscian> this is a lot of lore
[2:35:24] <+VantaLow> xqcSword IRON
[2:35:28] <+Grayhammatter> gustadolph... that's a name
[2:35:29] <%crimsonharvest> what do you bet the guy with adolph in his name is bad
[2:35:30] <Aeonknight_87> octopath was so damn good
[2:35:31] <%Bailey__gaming> it's always the Arch Duke
[2:35:33] <%BoxNavy> so they made ff6 without a story
[2:35:33] <ytwitchmeng> Is that the Ashford family?
[2:35:34] <%JoshManVGH> Water, Salt and Iron. What was that war called? Saltiron War. Oh ok.
[2:35:39] <+Ne0nF0xx> all jrpg kingdoms with a black theme instantly bad
[2:35:41] <%emperordread> Who needs FFT when you got newer stuff tho?
[2:35:42] <rcand9> god ff6 was so good
[2:35:43] <@commanderclaw> The person on the left is my type
[2:35:45] <Aydarkzero> Spiritual Successor i suppose
[2:35:45] <%Arancet> NOT THE WHITIES
[2:35:47] <@SoFarFetched> @Jrocy247 DC be really wanting their money
[2:35:48] <KaiserMario> I wonder if that guy is Evil?
[2:35:49] <+SpookyCookieMonster> I want a FFT Remake in a new engine
[2:35:50] <%wibbwobbler> so tru :(
[2:35:51] <%MegboyManuel> the art is beautiful
[2:35:52] <%PettyFunk> Octopath was SUCH a 6/10 with the potential to be an 8/10
[2:35:53] <+BIumen> so do these events normally happen during gameplay i wonder
[2:35:56] <ItsJustShawn> a fort full of wolves
[2:35:56] <%Ipsenscastle> to be fair they did make other Final Fantasy Tacticses and they sucked
[2:35:58] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> lol Sara
[2:35:59] <%Agami23> sasuke?
[2:36:00] <%DashXero> He looks kinda like Ramsay Bolton...
[2:36:02] <%handsomerakshas> Star frostian marines
[2:36:03] <%hax_metatron> Why are Japanese games obsessed with monarchy
[2:36:03] <Profmcstevie> Do these games ALWAYS use this setup? neighbouring warring countries
[2:36:05] <%Raiden_Breaker> he looks very GoT
[2:36:08] <@SoFarFetched> Ah yes Mr. Eggs Benedict
[2:36:10] <cardamomo88> DILF¬°¬°
[2:36:10] <%CopperTucker> I am so on board with this game
[2:36:13] <Aydarkzero> yeah this art is actually looking solid
[2:36:14] <dizimous> Do y'all need to be told the Three Houses didn't invent 3 country settings, or are you all just meming?
[2:36:14] <Aeonknight_87> Octopath was better than Bravely Default
[2:36:14] <disflipmat> Benedict already sounds like Gouto in my head
[2:36:17] <%Movemeister> Roland DansGame
[2:36:17] <%Xelhesia> damn this looks good

[2:36:25] <inkandamber> So...Tactics 2?
[2:36:26] <%Monkeyweed21> Everything in Octopath is a 10/10 except the actual story
[2:36:27] <%CavemanInCave> square enix sucks, nicks sucks, yankees sucks, krypton sucks
[2:36:28] <TrollKing96> @PatStaresAt Didn't the characters in Octopath not interact because the devs thought players would choose their party and stick with those characters for the whole game?
[2:36:28] <+SpookyCookieMonster> she going to die
[2:36:29] <%PettyFunk> Same art director from Bravely and Nier Automata right?

[2:45:57] <blastazoid00> This game looks pretty
[2:45:58] <Profmcstevie> I can't believe ashley roboto is an NPC
[2:45:59] <rcand9> hes cool
[2:46:00] <Harro8> Roboto?
[2:46:00] <$BlowFireThroatTotem> didn't actually roboto kill a guy?
[2:46:01] <%crimsonharvest> He looks like Gaston
[2:46:01] <rcand9> and die
[2:46:02] <+Ne0nF0xx> Oh hes definitely dead
[2:46:02] <Darren716> He is dead
[2:46:04] <+akira_chong> @PatStaresAt The overpowered depth-of-field effect is mimicking the look of a photographed miniature. That Link's Awakening Switch game does it as well.
[2:46:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> COOL OLD GUY MARKED FOR DEATH
[2:46:09] <rufus2k2> GET FUCKED
[2:46:09] <$apolitenoob> Wow this is gorgeous

[2:46:14] <rufus2k2> YOU DAMN GOBLIN
[2:46:14] <+paladinstarbuster> arator is DEAD
[2:46:16] <%PettyFunk> I feel like the straight on low angle worked better in Octopath though, it made it look like a shadowbox diorama thingy. The isometric angle doesn‚Äôt suit the style as well, but maybe that‚Äôs just me
[2:46:16] <cardamomo88> HUGEETT
[2:46:18] <tanarath> eat it, Pat
[2:46:20] <LordOfThePoultry> aaahahahaha get fucked pat

[2:46:24] <Aydarkzero> Mentor character gonna die LUL
[2:46:26] <%wibbwobbler> im glad a sequel happened, looks like they learned some stuff
[2:46:26] <%DianaTheAscian> OTS SO GOOD
[2:46:27] <%luckypineapple> this aestetic kicks ass
[2:46:29] <%PanicSwytch> SEND THE FEEDBACK FOR HUG ETTE
[2:46:29] <%samTUMZlettuce> I hate when they say NAMES.
[2:46:30] <%GarbageQueenEllie> The Prince can suck it, let im die
[2:46:31] <heartlesshealer> Pat: 0 Voiced Dialogue: 1
[2:46:31] <%crimsonharvest> I love the aesthetic but i really have a hard time with all the purple prose
[2:46:33] <Solidnick18> nice water
[2:46:33] <%hax_metatron> GAMEPLAY? NotLikeThis
[2:46:34] <Profmcstevie> Oh hey the water calmed down
[2:46:34] <%M4T1A5> is there gameplay?
[2:46:35] <OneThousandTomatoes> I'm honestly fine with it being in the middle of the story
[2:46:37] <Dommykins> this is such a weird opening for a demo
[2:46:40] <%s_xylocalsingles> this is ALOT of plot
[2:46:40] <+LastHazzerd> Benny has a narraitor voice
[2:46:41] <Delanus_Turgias> the octopath aesthetic was the best part of the game
[2:46:41] <%edibleskeleton> IN THESE TRYING TIMES
[2:46:47] <+Ne0nF0xx> Benedict might betray
[2:46:47] <%Kain_Felmont> are they just hanging out? how have they not been caught yet?
[2:46:47] <Explodincatz> gameplay when
[2:46:49] <+theshinyhunterdom> Hugh and Fred you know the ladies
[2:46:49] <%medusasghost> these names...
[2:46:50] <+GingerStrawhat> They give you a lot of story, I have to assume it's to hook you a little bit
[2:46:50] <cardamomo88> WHO?
[2:46:51] <Tuna_Can_0> MAY I OFFER YOU AN EGG
[2:46:51] <%Wydamn> He's probably going to die in a huge standoff with the rest of the party running away
[2:46:52] <sweetestbeefs> benedict is totally a traitor
[2:46:53] <+OwlLightningMage> WHY IS THERE SO MUCH STORY WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
[2:46:54] <%hax_metatron> Where is gameplay NotLikeThis
[2:46:55] <Aeonknight_87> look at that water
[2:46:56] <rcand9> gustadolph is also not a name
[2:46:56] <+TheotherKristian> I wish this was fire emblem
[2:46:56] <OneThousandTomatoes> @m4t1a5 they said there would be
[2:46:58] <inkandamber> This is some Gundam ass/Front Mission plot already.
[2:47:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You'll NEVER save Prince Horace!
[2:47:03] <olaksi> all the dialogue has just been white noise for me
[2:47:05] <+OwlLightningMage> THIS DEMO SUCKS
[2:47:06] <%PettyFunk> @delanus_turgias Nah the music was the best
[2:47:07] <Delanus_Turgias> also everything being voiced is concerning for how in depth the choices can really be
[2:47:08] <NitronStreams> King Dragon?
[2:47:09] <cardamomo88> EEGS DONT LIE
[2:47:09] <rcand9> demo of the games story
[2:47:11] <KaiserMario> Some of this characters sound like they're from Dragon's Dogma
[2:47:12] <%samTUMZlettuce> Just gotta touch of the consumption.
[2:47:14] <%Monkeyweed21> this VA sounds like a placeholder
[2:47:16] <%cvp5127> gameplay?
[2:47:18] <%Movemeister> When do we get to the fireworks factory/tactics :(
[2:47:20] <%crimsonharvest> Ah so this is a Crusader Kings plot
[2:47:20] <sweetestbeefs> STOP TALKING
[2:47:21] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt is the best thing that came from octopath its art style?
[2:47:24] <+OwlLightningMage> WHY ARE THEY STILL TALKING
[2:47:24] <rcand9> yup
[2:47:25] <%JoshManVGH> Even the DEMO is spoilers
[2:47:28] <iosephe> Just skip straight to gameplay
[2:47:28] <Tuna_Can_0> Is this a play?
[2:47:29] <Aydarkzero> this is a really WEIRD spot to drop us in
[2:47:30] <+Delenay> lol they should have just done the battles
[2:47:30] <+king_of_beggars> When are we going to get to the fireworks factory?
[2:47:31] <%DianaTheAscian> this is way to heavy
[2:47:32] <%Teintstein> ya it's a bit much for a demo
[2:47:33] <%Mr_Pylon> this seems like a bad choice for a demo
[2:47:33] <rcand9> way too heavy for a fuckin demo
[2:47:34] <%CopperTucker> I'm already fuckin invested as hell
[2:47:34] <mudapersona> they really want you to get curious
[2:47:37] <+Carquar> I thought they would just bring you straight to a battle?
[2:47:38] <%samTUMZlettuce> Great SCOTT
[2:47:43] <rcand9> this is a japanese ass spoiler demo
[2:47:45] <Delanus_Turgias> @PettyFunk the music was fuckin high tier, but I just love the look more
[2:47:47] <%LouieRouie> Get to the gameplay, demo
[2:47:47] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> hue hue hue
[2:47:48] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> the banners look nice
[2:47:49] <+SilverDevilfish> Bad Bracelet
[2:47:49] <+D00msDayDan> they're throwing out a ton of names and intrigue and i feel completely lost
[2:47:49] <%ChungusQuest> Oh hey, Benedict kinda sounds like the Mass Effect encyclopedia narrator.
[2:47:50] <+Ne0nF0xx> "We must make the player hit the A button repeatedly!"
[2:47:51] <RayShadow278> Well, it is a demo
[2:47:51] <Explodincatz> japan is really bad with spoilers jeez
[2:47:51] <%cvp5127> why put out a demo that spoils when the twist happens?
[2:47:52] <%Teintstein> I guess if like 75% of the game is talking this is a representative demo
[2:47:52] <OneThousandTomatoes> I think this telling people that there were be more of a main story this time
[2:47:53] <%pectusumbra> It's spoils for a game over a year away. You'll forget
[2:47:54] <Darren716> I want them to offer a bad translation version
[2:47:54] <olaksi> good kingdom attacked by evil kingdom, got it, move on
[2:47:57] <nivlac_555> L I T T L E M O N E Y
[2:47:58] <%Deft_Thought> I wish we could get another Breath of Fire game
[2:47:59] <%super_ej8> It's nice to show off the VA but it is REALLY heavy
[2:48:00] <+OwlLightningMage> This demo is stupid
[2:48:00] <%CopperTucker> I want to know so much
[2:48:01] <%radda343> some of these line reads are super weird
[2:48:03] <LordOfThePoultry> Kappa
[2:48:03] <Aydarkzero> but i am interested in this it looks really cool
[2:48:04] <Delanus_Turgias> also look at those ul'dah banners
[2:48:05] <cardamomo88> SO DONT
[2:48:05] <+TunyNinja> This voice acting is r o u g h
[2:48:05] <dizimous> Ya this is Bizzare
[2:48:07] <%cache_22> Pat, are you having to click for each dialog box? Does Fast-Forward just skip the dialog?
[2:48:09] <%spoiledbadger> oh man this actict, oof
[2:48:10] <ToneBacas> is that Zief snoring?
[2:48:10] <TheNix> upwards, not forwards
[2:48:11] <rearedlogarithm> They probably should have cut out all this shit from the demo.
[2:48:11] <%Ipsenscastle> this isnt a patch on war of the lions' script
[2:48:12] <%HitchhikingThrough> Yeap, that's gonna need a few retakes
[2:48:13] <robotman37> d a n g a
[2:48:13] <Jrocy247> God, this line reading from the main character....
[2:48:14] <+SilverDevilfish> I got a good feeling
[2:48:14] <rcand9> LOL
[2:48:14] <%vexion_smh> why can't they just make a demo scenario or whatever
[2:48:15] <katzroy56> Blame yourself, or god
[2:48:15] <+Flutts_> I'm late how bad is the voice acting
[2:48:17] <ToneBacas> i mean Gief*
[2:48:18] <+Ne0nF0xx> Project Visual Novel
[2:48:18] <inkandamber> This will be a prologue.
[2:48:18] <rcand9> littlemoney

[2:48:23] <%Mendin> Defeat Dycedarg's Elder Brother
[2:48:25] <goodguybadman> Instead.... my.... actions.... beep boop
[2:48:25] <sweetestbeefs> please get a new voice actor for seranoa
[2:48:28] <LordOfThePoultry> so which one is the traitor?
[2:48:29] <dizimous> What is that read
[2:48:29] <+GingerStrawhat> It will probably be in the main game
[2:48:29] <%cervidaequus> Protagonist sounds like a david cage french child actor
[2:48:29] <+theshinyhunterdom> You know when a girl is pretty but won‚Äôt shut the fuck up
[2:48:30] <Ace5335> egg
[2:48:32] <+theshinyhunterdom> This
[2:48:32] <+froduck42> the protag sounds like he was directed by the Japanese Voice over director
[2:48:36] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @flutts_ its ok for some, kinda bad for the main dude
[2:48:38] <%aishman> The voice acting is fine though?
[2:48:38] <%Toynota10> maybe you can look in options when you're out of cutscene
[2:48:38] <Tuna_Can_0> Visual novel demo KEKW
[2:48:39] <BrOOnoh> who cares about spoilers this game is coming 2022
[2:48:40] <%Bluwizard21> serenoa is a horrible name
[2:48:44] <%BinaryFireball> what's little money?
[2:48:50] <heartlesshealer> Who is Serenoa's VA? It seems like he's either being directed into awkward on purpose, or it's a first role...
[2:48:55] <%Ranryu692> Hopefully that'll be something you can write-in on the survey they said they were doing eventually
[2:49:00] <sweetestbeefs> oh thank god
[2:49:00] <%Teintstein> why didn't they just start here
[2:49:01] <%JoshManVGH> I. promise. to. do. everything. in. my. power. Oh. no. a. man. got. murdered.

[2:49:02] <%Toynota10> is there an option in the pause menu for auto advance?
[2:49:02] <+OwlLightningMage> Exploration phase sounds cool
[2:49:03] <sweetestbeefs> they stopped talking
[2:49:06] <%pectusumbra> Yo that's actually cool
[2:49:07] <%samTUMZlettuce> Whoah whoah

[2:49:14] <%sniffy77> nice retweet paige
[2:49:15] <%HitchhikingThrough> that fucks me up
[2:49:16] <+OwlLightningMage> The demo should just start here
[2:49:17] <+Ne0nF0xx> Movement looks so weird tho
[2:49:20] <%chiazam> TALK TO YOUR PEEPS
[2:49:21] <heartlesshealer> if it's a first role that's pretty cool
[2:49:23] <%Dementedpenguin> That water is mesmerizing me.

[2:49:33] <artoflec> nice UI
[2:49:34] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> level 8 doesn't seem like a middle of a game, unless this is fairly short
[2:49:34] <Sokumotanaka> ACROBAT
[2:49:35] <$lotharrio> Maybe you can set the auto advance now?
[2:49:36] <%komradedog> komradedog subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 33 months, currently on a 24 month streak! almost 3 years. work them psaBig psaBig strats Pat
