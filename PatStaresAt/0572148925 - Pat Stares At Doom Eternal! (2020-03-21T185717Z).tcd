[0:02:59] <mrfreezepunsbestpuns> cheer500 hello Pat from PatStaresAt, when I played RE6 with a friend I decided we should suffer and give up, so to motivate him to do so I put the difficulty all the way up, little did I know difficulty is not game-specific but player-specific, so while I took 3 pips of damage a swing my friend took a single pip of damage and was dealing way more damage than me, I could not find a way to change my difficulty since it would always reset to hardest when I loaded our game up. FUCK RE6

[0:05:03] <%StaceMcGate> @colouroftheiris77 The DLC is just as long as the base game, If you have beaten Witcher 3 before I'd honestly recommend skipping that and going straight to DLC. I was burnt out by the time I was midway through Heart of Stone

[0:09:32] <lucain_wreath> @PatStaresAt Mistake? they where quite blatant that it was on purpose.
[0:09:37] <%DensityD> What is the reason you don't have the BFG between Doom2016 and the start of Eternal?
[0:09:38] <spongeofmystery> But the first mistake was just on Phobos

[0:09:48] <devanmuse> I'm surprised that "doomguy" is a canon term now
[0:09:49] <%StaceMcGate> @Sundaysmiles01 yeah, it was the guy he killed last time. That Priest took over after Mars
[0:09:54] <%D00msDayDan> i'm on mission 10 and they have still made now explanation to how he got from there to here

What if I LOVE the game and it's another thing to distract me from being produtive on my book? What if I get addicted but find it stressful and gives me confusing anxiety? God damn my shit is so fucked, why am I like this? >:(

[0:51:59] <1matheuw> dont spoil him chat
[0:51:59] <%Niney_Who> No Barons are different
[0:51:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> no
[0:52:00] <%TheTardisTent> TheTardisTent subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Hey Pat, I have the Saturday-lazy-brain, but I managed to figure how this works, so we're aaaaall good now! Glad to finally be in a position to throw some real money to you guys, rather than just switching the Prime between you and Paige. All the best!
[0:52:02] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Remember when games like this made everyone quake in their Puritan boots?
[0:52:03] <%Niney_Who> Barons are VERY Big
[0:52:06] <%Lizard0TM> No Pat, barons are a different monster
[0:52:07] <+Qsmash_> aren't barons the big red guys?
[0:52:17] <%Nobrev> baron of hell is a different demon entirely
[0:52:18] <Artista_AF> i thought the Barons were the buff guys
[0:52:20] <%Lizard0TM> Barons are the big guys with horns
[0:52:21] <%StaceMcGate> @GarbageQueenEllie people still ban Harry Potter books for witchcraft
[0:52:29] <%Lizard0TM> they were different in Doom 2016
[0:52:29] <+mrkatmonarchy> the brain has ribs
[0:52:33] <%Niney_Who> They were in 2016 too. They were only similar to hell knights in classic doom
[0:52:34] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Barons are the huge guys pat
[0:52:43] <gekizenbu> there's a lot of variants on the same enemy apparently now, there's like two types of Imps
[0:52:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @StaceMcGate When they should be banning them for the GAY. According to JK
[0:52:48] <%DensityD> he is a fast boy
[0:53:00] <KasiCrafter> This game would be perfect if it wasn't for ONE enemy type. You guys know the one.
[0:53:01] <%StaceMcGate> big imps and smol imps
[0:53:02] <%Nobrev> they were always a different demon pat psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:53:02] <%Niney_Who> Yeah the Teleporters
[0:53:05] <rufus2k2> @GarbageQueenEllie they found new things to complain about, like what is clearly a joke at the insanity of corporations linking up with Hell is suddenly ableism or some crap
[0:53:10] <%DensityD> you killed a raggedy imp already
[0:53:11] <%Aeoneth> fucking hate teleporters
[0:53:11] <ScreamLord> Dire Imp
[0:53:21] <1matheuw> in the original doom the hell knights were donwgraded versions of the barons

[0:55:48] <%valriot> After beating the game, im super excited to see what those are
[0:55:50] <Zebroneath> Multiplayer DLC that was eventually made free cause it seperated the player base
[0:55:53] <%Niney_Who> Destroy these immediately
[0:55:54] <+zaibatsu_member_333> But the Zoomers love there Multi playerr
[0:55:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> SWOLE STONES
[0:55:57] <%Aleate> Fuck these totems
[0:56:08] <%Niney_Who> complecaited

[0:56:14] <Shishi1205> oh yeah
[0:56:17] <Ivarent> So, can we call Doom a character action game now?
[0:56:21] <rufus2k2> look, if people want MP various iterations of COD are right there
[0:56:22] <+zaibatsu_member_333> like there Front night, an the Pug, G an there Mind craft Battle Royals
[0:56:24] <%ArcanumMBD> So you actually have ot kill these demons
[0:56:24] <Shishi1205> that buff totem music tho
[0:56:26] <%ArcanumMBD> this tutorial is dumb
[0:56:30] <%Aeoneth> Doom is 1--% a char action game
[0:56:33] <Fien111> Yes
[0:56:35] <%DensityD> make the flesh pistons raise up

[0:56:50] <+soullesskin> Kill demons to find it
[0:56:56] <ScreamLord> Gotta find the totum of red sexual energy
[0:56:56] <Zebroneath> Tutorial misleads this time
[0:56:56] <%ArcanumMBD> The tutorial is like "kill the totem not the demons" and then the next room you have to kill demons to get access to the totem
[0:56:58] <%DensityD> environment puzzle, for your gun
[0:56:59] <rufus2k2> was that a knee?!
[0:57:01] <%ArcanumMBD> it's the only totem in the game like that

[1:04:20] <+twohitgood> when you find your build, just stick with it. right?
[1:04:20] <%Aeoneth> Time slow IS SUPER GOOD
[1:04:30] <sonicblade38> nothing beats DOOM time
[1:04:31] <@commanderclaw> This encounter is rough
[1:04:32] <%frydaynitefight> damn that flame beltch chainsaw combo is great
[1:04:34] <+mechslayer71> @stacemcgate nowhere near 20 hours bro
[1:04:37] <superchronicc> here's a tip, you can turn off those in-game tips
[1:04:43] <KasiCrafter> Gotta quickscope for max DPS.
[1:04:48] <gekizenbu> SORB
[1:04:51] <%valriot> This is the Fuck Room LUL

[1:05:29] <+mechslayer71> @stacemcgate I wonder if it’s based on how often he does it. Like “ did you forget about this?”
[1:05:30] <ataxia72> what difficulty is Pat playing on?
[1:05:30] <%dekkitout> With this kit, Doomguy needs to be in a fighting game
[1:05:43] <Fiendmaw> This could be faster,but he's playing on a controller
[1:05:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> # DoomGuyForSmash
[1:05:45] <DKthundah> i find myself biting the insides of my cheek whenever i get out of a battle

[1:06:17] <LeeOhX> I love that you tear away at their flesh
[1:06:18] <rufus2k2> man after seeing that MK11 Spawn ending, I wish Spawn couldget an FPS like this but with additional magic shit a la Hexen
[1:06:19] <Ivarent> Doom's Heavy Metal album cover hell
[1:06:19] <%Niney_Who> QUAD
[1:06:21] <%StaceMcGate> @mechslayer71 He's killed every shield enemy he has encountered with the plasma gun so I don't think that is the case

[1:06:32] <rufus2k2> and of course, Keith David voice

[1:06:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doom guy back in his old clothes is great
[1:07:02] <superchronicc> if you can manage to dash on an object, sometimes you can fly into the stratosphere i find
[1:07:03] <%DensityD> down with the devil
[1:07:05] <ThorgrimFunhammer> zawarudo
[1:07:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Fun Fact: did you know that you can get away with a lower gore rating on ESRB if you recolor the blood so it's not red?
[1:07:10] <%ospreyworks> ospreyworks subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months, currently on a 3 month streak! Glad you’re around for some laughs while I’m self-quarantining! Hope Paige and Elmo are doing well!
[1:07:12] <dreamfillah> god, doom is just so gratifyingly simple
[1:07:12] <%DensityD> icon of SATAN
[1:07:14] <Ivarent> The only weapon that surpassed the super shotgun was... a super shotgun with a grappling hook
[1:07:18] <Shishi1205> wow the rocket launcher is better in this game
[1:07:22] <%YakumoYomi> @rufus2k2 It would be sick if we got a Spawn Hexen game as sick as this.

[1:07:55] <rufus2k2> @GarbageQueenEllie that also works for television and movies, the show Hannibal basically asked the censor board what they had to do to get keyscenes to pass and it was like "lower the lighting"
[1:07:56] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAIGE HAS INFECTED PAT WITH THE SUNDOWN

[1:09:01] <%ricky12k> @cobaltor_252 he rarely sleeps which is why he is sounding tired.
[1:09:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DensityD actually there are some viruses that hender cognition of people but don't harm humans in any other eway
[1:09:11] <ThorgrimFunhammer> I mean it is pulsating and toothy so yeah maybe

[1:12:16] <Fien111> or rather, directly into it
[1:12:18] <+MisterCrimson> I'm getting the vibe that the UAC is a really shitty version of the SCP
[1:12:26] <rufus2k2> Unitology at least sugarcoated it instead of actually spitting in your face

[1:14:39] <%dekkitout> Your bunker-dungeon has a cafe built in?
[1:14:42] <rufus2k2> @superchronicc Unitology felt like they poured honey in your ear, UAC is pouring hot coffee in your ear and tell you DOESN'T THAT FEEL NICE?!

[1:15:45] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @StaceMcGate Rehab and the Javas are both great.
[1:15:48] <%Ner234> Powerful JAW
[1:15:51] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @enby_shout Ever since Pat started lowkey product placing it, I've been sampling a bunch
[1:15:58] <enby_shout> what if doomguy was a mormon
[1:16:02] <razieltano123> @ryderbootz Get on the robot Doomguy.
[1:16:06] <rufus2k2> i'M lowkey curious to see how the sword works in this
[1:16:07] <%YakumoYomi> Is Paige the Rockbiter?
[1:16:14] <%Totally_not_toby> doomguy is canonically catholic, actually
[1:16:14] <%StaceMcGate> Regular monsters are too sugary and give me heart palpatations when I try to sleep
[1:16:17] <ThorgrimFunhammer> doom guy might punch Jesus too
[1:16:20] <+AllenDeadman> water
[1:16:25] <+mrkatmonarchy> Father Doomslayer
[1:16:32] <Saltmeisterr> I think the sword is a one hit kill on anything
[1:16:33] <superchronicc> @rufus2k2 at least UAC'S beliefs actually lead to somewhere after, unlike unitology
[1:16:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> Doomguy is a militant agnostic he doesn't know what to believe and THAT MAKES HIM ANGRY!
[1:16:48] <oAznoUta> Paige, the Ruby Weapon; second of her name, biter of rocks, eater of glass, just the ham
[1:16:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @GarbageQueenEllie The Hawaiian punch Monster is also super good.
[1:16:56] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Man being a DO0Mer Never felt so good
[1:16:57] <1matheuw> CHAINGUN CHAAAN
[1:16:58] <%StaceMcGate> DOOM Guy is pure catholic
[1:16:58] <+MisterCrimson> POG
[1:16:59] <%Ner234> GIVE
[1:17:00] <%Lizard0TM> Is Pats head shiny?
[1:17:00] <sakeydo> my brain is still processing that paige can cook, considering most of us have known her as the mcdonalds queen.
[1:17:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEY
[1:17:03] <%Jhylla81> I prefer Rockstar to Monster but my work only has Monster so I usually drink that
[1:17:03] <%Totally_not_toby> doomguy says his hail marys do not slander him
[1:17:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> time to shred
[1:17:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> I see doomguy pressing his face onto the glass
[1:17:35] <bluebiscuit94> So is ARC just X-Com?
[1:17:41] <Saltmeisterr> yes
[1:17:43] <%DensityD> and a partridge in a pear tree
[1:17:44] <%StaceMcGate> ARC is X-Com 2

[1:18:22] <razieltano123> For Doom Slayer, weapons are his waifus.
[1:18:24] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I like my coffee to scream

[1:18:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> That must be some DEMON LORD esk coffee
[1:18:56] <%Jhylla81> Doom guy needs nuke gauntlets. Each punch hits like an atomic blast
[1:18:56] <%Niney_Who> HAZMAT SUIT PogChamp

[1:20:04] <superchronicc> isnt this game, basically just doom 2 anyway
[1:20:05] <KasiCrafter> We see it, and it's appropriate considering his air mobility.
[1:20:05] <LeeOhX> oh aight
[1:20:08] <therakishsage> WAHOO RIP AND-A TEAR
[1:20:13] <%Jhylla81> This looks like a Crash Bandicoot level
[1:20:22] <%YakumoYomi> Is this what Mario actually sees, and what we see is just a saccharine filter?
[1:20:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Pat you gotta get 20 coins to buy a Star

[1:21:23] <%moondog_> moondog_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! Pat is tiny angry man playing a big angry man.
[1:21:24] <%Totally_not_toby> paige is having the sun uppening
[1:21:24] <Shishi1205> to get the battery
[1:21:25] <%StaceMcGate> BLORB
[1:21:30] <stickygumbolee> For a hot second, I thought Fake Cortana was Paige talking
[1:21:31] <LeeOhX> the UAC is what happens when Woolie gets his way
[1:21:31] <%Jhylla81> Because she just woke up
[1:21:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> THAT'S THE BIG DARK LINE
[1:21:32] <+zaibatsu_member_333> bLORBS!?
[1:21:34] <%AncelDeLambert> ... uuuuuuh, when did the ENTIRE UAC switch over to the demon side? I thought that was just the old lady's thing
[1:21:34] <%NovaKnightmare> This lady is like worse than 30% of mega corps
[1:21:41] <razieltano123> THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS HOLOGRAM LADY.
[1:21:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @anceldelambert She had cultists
[1:21:47] <Mexrage> she does sounds like paige
[1:21:50] <+mrkatmonarchy> Invasion and Locked door, is Doom the Dark Souls of FPS?
[1:21:52] <+zaibatsu_member_333> do they have Rorbs too?
[1:21:58] <%AncelDeLambert> @GeneralSCPatton yes, but the ENTIRE corporation?
[1:21:59] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt The UAC is not the best choice, It's Spacers Choice
[1:22:01] <%Jhylla81> Pick up that smash orb
[1:22:10] <+Qsmash_> FLESH WALL
[1:22:19] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Rorb Key?
[1:22:19] <whirly25> That looks really fragile
[1:22:22] <%DensityD> GO TIME
[1:22:23] <whirly25> But not that fragile
[1:22:23] <%DensityD> YE
[1:22:29] <%ArcanumMBD> Firmly grasp the flesh wall
[1:22:30] <%GeneralSCPatton> @razieltano123 No but, like, once you don't exist you can't feel anything. It's morally neutral, obviously.
[1:22:31] <%YakumoYomi> @stickygumbolee The "don't be afraid" bit fooled me. I thought Paige was about to murder someone.
[1:22:32] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Rore Key??
[1:22:33] <KasiCrafter> LITERAL heart chamber.
[1:22:48] <%theGreatGoon > doom guy always has access to my heart chamber
[1:22:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> @anceldelambert There was a split between the cultists and Samuel Hayden's forces
[1:22:56] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Nicely done though
[1:23:01] <Shishi1205> you need to go back if you wan the battery
[1:23:02] <Sundaysmiles01> delicious praetor suit points
[1:23:04] <LeeOhX> DoomGuy has access to all my chambers
[1:23:04] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Everything's so gooey and slimy in Hell. I'm surprised you can get a decent grip.
[1:23:08] <reinbachthe3rd> This looks fun.
[1:23:16] <Shishi1205> you have to go around down the gutter
[1:23:16] <ataxia72> is Pat okay
[1:23:17] <1matheuw> i think theres another weapon mod up there
[1:23:18] <Mexrage> i wish i had the cash to buy this game, i hope the faster gameplay doesn't make it unbearable with controller on base ps4
[1:23:20] <AzirothTheGreat> secret path
[1:23:29] <+BoomerTiro> It's basically Metroid Prime, but Doom
[1:23:31] <PirateMike_> Hows quorantine going everyone?
[1:23:34] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @theGreatGoon Hes no longer just "Doom Guy" He is now The Doom SLAYER
[1:23:35] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> it gets so much tough those secrets missions
[1:23:42] <stickygumbolee> @YakumoYomi Yeah, same. I thought she had finally had enough of Pat's goblins

[1:24:12] <Mitchell87mc> pengwinFine pengwinFine pengwinFine pengwinFine

[1:24:21] <%Mr_Strut> DRINCC
[1:24:23] <1matheuw> i think hes in 30% of the game
[1:24:24] <ScreamLord> Scream Cream Latte
[1:24:25] <ataxia72> that secret mission is the hardest so far, I've played a mission or two past this
[1:24:32] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Sounds like a latte of work

[2:00:59] <%Nobrev> download more brain RAM
[2:01:00] <kingbaconcrispy> you were right. Plague is good at talking to himself like a crazy person. He talks nonstop and makes fun of the demons peepee.
[2:01:01] <%MintDepression> Pat needs brains, badly
[2:01:03] <bleugh> takes a high IQ to understand doom tbh
[2:01:04] <stickygumbolee> Chainsaw for Brains, Pat

[2:01:11] <%Niney_Who> yes
[2:01:12] <+Pookiedaexzile> Don't Worry Woolie will never play this becuase he's a contrarian dickhead.
[2:01:13] <%TheActuallyGuy> It's ok because the lack of commentary is always when there is a ton of action on screen.
[2:01:13] <+noobzoar_two_hands> is pat playing on PC or PS4?

[2:08:18] <%BoomerUnchained> Keen is the shit
[2:08:20] <%chronotriggerhappy123> well actually the bloodline has to go through Commander Keen aka Billy Blaze
[2:08:24] <gluemanofficial> Would the black sheep of the Blaskowitz family be super lame? Or cool but evil?
[2:08:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> Which Keen Female or Male?
[2:08:28] <%DensityD> no gay stuff though

[2:08:35] <%tusk102> @doc_ock_rokc male keen

[2:08:36] <%DensityD> and JO crystals
[2:08:38] <bluebiscuit94> So the oool skips a couple of generations?
[2:08:41] <+neeto_makar> Wait so Doomguy keeps his Grandpa's skull and helmet in his space house?

[2:22:19] <+TheShisno> The UAC have deadass just become evil this time around
[2:22:19] <TurtlesAndTentacles> was Sam the guy the Rock played?
[2:22:20] <Sundaysmiles01> YOU HAVE FUCKED UP NOW
[2:22:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OOPSY DAISY
[2:22:22] <DexteraXIII> Oopsies
[2:22:23] <%AncelDeLambert> I don't understand why this takes place years after the first game
[2:22:26] <%EtheralFlameX> don't worry it gets worse
[2:22:26] <@Fuggins4U> Hayden gonna Hayd
[2:22:27] <gekizenbu> on one hand you're right, on the other hand motherfucker shouldnt have played with hell in the first place
[2:22:35] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Somebody order the DOOMSLAYER?
[2:22:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> This level has good lore
[2:22:40] <%dalmek> more like Haydone
[2:22:48] <Camail> is this the most videogame video game ever?
[2:22:57] <%tusk102> @gekizenbu admittedly it did save earth until olovia fucked things up
[2:22:58] <+zaibatsu_member_333> Sam HAyden, Now your walking on THE SUN
[2:22:58] <%Manjove> the final boss of this level is fucking hard
[2:22:59] <%MrBorisMakarov> man imagine the elevator opening and its motherfucking DOOMGUY
[2:23:01] <%AncelDeLambert> we all knew Hayden was an idiot, but the sheer MAGNITUDE of his fuckup is baffling
[2:23:11] <Shishi1205> Im waiting for that flame hook
[2:23:26] <%doc_ock_rokc> apt
[2:23:28] <%Manjove> he is the only wall i have hit so far on UV

[2:23:38] <%AncelDeLambert> like, who on earth believed Hayden's bullshit enough on earth to play with the crucible after the complete DISASTER that was the Mars facility?
[2:23:44] <gekizenbu> @twohitgood yes
[2:23:46] <Reizie_Etherealm> It's baffling to think one man can steer humanity into extinction so damn hard

[2:23:54] <%tusk102> why does everyone keep blaming samuel when things were fine for years until olivia fucked everything up. Yes messing with hell was stupid but it was working just fine until that bitch messed it up
[2:23:54] <Shishi1205> Oh he has a hearth

[2:24:00] <%Aracon_> psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:24:00] <1matheuw> freeze the bitch
[2:24:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Look at what Chernobyl did to nuclear power planetwide, and that was PEANUTS compared to opening a portal to hell!
[2:24:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DensityD why did you lie to your parents? just tell them the truth and they'll be okay
[2:24:19] <+TheShisno> Because Hell ALWAYS bad
[2:24:21] <%Jekado> Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Cheer100 Hi again Paige and Pat (you're Pat), another cat fact. You know when Elmo was kicking Paige's arm when she was petting him. That is because Elmo was trying to break his prey's neck. Cats, instinctively, will grab prey with their fore-paw's and kick rapidly with their back paws to break their prey's necks. Just remember when Elmo is kicking is because he is a cute cuddly murder machine.
[2:24:22] <%XeroSigmaPrime> This ultraviolence?

[2:24:38] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @tusk102 I'm with you. He didn't fuck it all up.

[2:35:21] <%StaceMcGate> the chaingun makes my speaker shakes
[2:35:21] <KasiCrafter> I think Bastion mode for the turret actually does MORE damage up close. Somehow. It's weird.

[2:35:37] <Oxybe> Ori 1 helps build the feels that will murder your heart at the end of Ori 2
[2:35:38] <+zaibatsu_member_333> LUL LUL LUL LUL
[2:35:40] <Zebroneath> This game is missing Arcade mode from 2016, sadly.
[2:35:47] <bigbreh> @KasiCrafter I think you can ram enemies with the shield
[2:35:49] <+The_H1R0> Is there a way everyone who bought this game can buy Mick Gordon a beer. I mean holy shit at this music.
[2:35:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Oxybe Man I cried for hours after that
[2:35:56] <lloyddboy> ATLAS

[3:07:08] <+taggerung403> I love the sound of doomslayer climbing stuff
[3:07:09] <MasterTonberry23> As far as I'm concerned, what Doomguy was before is insignificant. What he has now become...is inconceivable.
[3:07:10] <+Pookiedaexzile> "Upgrades"

[3:13:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PAIN
[3:13:52] <Shishi1205> Cacodemeon
[3:13:53] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Dakuu75 He was always against what the lady in the previous game did. That's why he woke up Doom Guy, to stop Hell.
[3:13:54] <MasterTonberry23> @AncelDeLambert So they could fuck it harder
[3:13:57] <$megamonmon123> if only he didnt TRAP YOU IN HELL
[3:13:59] <%fattness132> Olivia started the invasion, but Sam Hayden sent doomguy away at the end of 2016
[3:14:02] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> pain elemental
[3:14:03] <%tusk102> @AncelDeLambert pats wrong. argent energy had already been sending power to earth for years
[3:14:04] <CrypticMochi> Wasn’t it mostly Olivia’s fault for bowing like a punk bitch?
[3:14:04] <BaslerJones> PAIN ELEMENTAL
[3:14:05] <Saltmeisterr> MEATBALL
[3:14:10] <LoneO7> dont forget to walk on solid ground
[3:14:10] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt remember its also his fault he let all that shit with olivia happen under his watch.
[3:14:14] <black_pariah> I'd almost rather it have been Hayden's evil plan than have him turbofumble like this
[3:14:17] <Ipsenscastle> done fucked it
[3:14:20] <ScreamLord> And for some reason the Crucible has a cool, Norse metal hilt instead of a gross demon meat helt now
[3:14:20] <Shishi1205> Load from checkpoint maybe?
[3:14:20] <%TaphexWin> ONE MEATY BOI
[3:14:29] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> reload the checkpoint
[3:14:31] <Reizie_Etherealm> Sometimes one extinction can only be prevented with the extinction of another
[3:14:31] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt look at haydens model in the codex
[3:14:40] <%StaceMcGate> So before Olivia tried to open the gate, the UAC was already infiltrated and Earth was doomed
[3:14:45] <3rdRunner> @screamlord they're different weapons actually
[3:14:47] <LeeOhX> LOOL
[3:14:57] <Shishi1205> I mean you were super low
[3:14:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psa1guy
[3:15:05] <%StaceMcGate> 2 more meat hook kills
[3:15:08] <%Nobrev> i think after you get it you reforge it because it's broken @ScreamLord
[3:15:09] <%Manjove> @black_pariah but Hayden was never evil, it though, just trusted a cultist
[3:15:10] <+thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt use the ballista arbalist mode for cacodemons and pain elementals, it one shots cacos
[3:15:11] <CrazyMedicine> More killing then
[3:15:34] <$megamonmon123> did pat get rhe snipe mode for the gauss cannon?
[3:15:52] <Saltmeisterr> gauss?
[3:15:52] <$megamonmon123> you could use the gauss cannon to fuck up the flying guys in the challenge
[3:16:01] <Reizie_Etherealm> That bop sfx for headshots is the goofiest ever
[3:16:03] <LeeOhX> If Pinkys had the armor on the back too this war would be much shorter
[3:16:07] <Saltmeisterr> oh u mean ballista
[3:16:09] <$megamonmon123> the replacement one in this game, forget what its called
[3:16:11] <Shishi1205> Oh so they drop armor
[3:16:11] <$megamonmon123> yeah
[3:16:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LITERALLY REVERSE SCORPION
[3:16:44] <%tusk102> nice
[3:16:45] <%StaceMcGate> "I'm Over Here!"
[3:16:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> That solves your armor problem for the whole game
[3:16:51] <+silvery_cricket> IM COMING OVER THERE
[3:16:54] <%dekkitout> "We in there"
[3:16:55] <Reizie_Etherealm> STAY OVER THERE
[3:16:56] <$Dakuu75> "aww shit, here we go again."
[3:16:56] <Shishi1205> Pain elemental
[3:16:56] <%tusk102> I'm coming over there @StaceMcGate
[3:17:00] <+taggerung403> i preferred 2016 glory kills, the blade is a little less cool than straight up using fists
[3:17:05] <$megamonmon123> use the snipe mode pat
[3:17:13] <TalisKanju> !uptime
[3:17:14] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 17m.
[3:17:29] <$Dakuu75> omg, he spits out lost-souls. wtf lol
[3:17:29] <+temporal_zenith> @Shishi1205 Imagine if captain planet had that instead of heart!
[3:17:30] <KinduVborrd> I would like to pet Elmo
[3:17:32] <$megamonmon123> gg

[3:17:44] <%SpicyVibration> SpicyVibration subscribed at Tier 3. 
[3:17:47] <ScreamLord> Pain is just a Caco with arms, LUL
[3:17:48] <%dekkitout> Bludpunch is a PROBLEM SOLVER
[3:17:49] <Damie904> Game so intense Pat can't even talk.
[3:17:50] <Goergorion> was it spitting lost souls?!
[3:17:55] <$RealThiele> yep
[3:18:01] <SummonerMagno> Poggers
[3:18:01] <VritraReiRei> why are you so good at this game PogChamp @PatStaresAt
[3:18:01] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> yeah pains create lost souls
[3:18:02] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @ScreamLord And he yeets Lost Souls
[3:18:06] <+TrueElements> Did pats cynical ass end up like animal crossing??
[3:18:16] <Vertigheist> Yeah
[3:18:17] <Jetsfantasy> Requires all 200 IQ
[3:18:20] <%tusk102> @TrueElements ye
[3:18:25] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @TrueElements Yup he and Piag play it no
[3:18:26] <+temporal_zenith> @ScreamLord I think in this game Caco's do have spindly little arms
[3:18:27] <$megamonmon123> its crazy the chainsaw is your reload button now
[3:18:31] <%Bane_Kaikyo> is it weird that even LISTENING to this stream is making my anxiety is going nuts and giving me moderate pain all over?
[3:18:38] <$megamonmon123> more so than in 2016
[3:18:40] <ryderbootz> Pat literally stares at
[3:18:47] <TalisKanju> I see you brought the Museum to your island @PatStaresAt
[3:18:48] <Jetsfantasy> @Bane_Kaikyo Think that's just the speed metal
[3:18:49] <LoneO7> mind explosion
[3:18:52] <%trustycoyote> That's fucking smart
[3:18:54] <%valriot> It was that in 2016
[3:19:03] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> i love that they made every weapon valuable, in2016 all you needed was the plasma, super shotty and guass cannon
[3:19:04] <$megamonmon123> less so cause your fuel didnt regenerate
[3:19:09] <%tusk102> @TrueElements he was like "short stream of animal crossing then doom" then streamed animal crossing for like 3 hours
[3:19:12] <%SaiyanShoto> And the enemies are the ammo boxes now
[3:19:12] <%Manjove> i wonder if that was intentional
[3:19:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt you also had to switch to it like a weapon
[3:19:23] <lloyddboy> LUL
[3:19:26] <Reizie_Etherealm> LUL
[3:19:26] <%StaceMcGate> TRAP
[3:19:26] <%valriot> No but it was still the traditional "reload button"
[3:19:27] <KinduVborrd> I can't believe Doom Eternal is just FPS DMC now, I am 100% okay with this
[3:19:31] <+Pookiedaexzile> 360 no scope it
[3:19:32] <toast144> you also had to manually switch to it instead of it being on a button always
[3:19:32] <TheFranss> @Bane_Kaikyo Ya know what that teams? I't doom time for you
[3:19:34] <+thesyndrome> there was chainsaw fuel in the sewcret room too
[3:19:35] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SURPRISE BITCH
[3:19:39] <Shishi1205> hype
[3:19:45] <+Pookiedaexzile> 360
[3:19:46] <+TrueElements> @tusk102 I’m glad his extreme blind hate didn’t make him hate it more
[3:19:47] <daigotsuarezu> boom headshot
[3:19:47] <$megamonmon123> gg pat
[3:19:51] <Shishi1205> That max payne slowmo is rad
[3:19:54] <%Totally_not_toby> also you had way more ammo in doom 2016 and you used less of it
[3:19:55] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @Jetsfantasy yeah, this metal is making me tense up super hard just in a default state
[3:20:01] <MasterTonberry23> Stupid Fat Kanos
[3:20:01] <%tusk102> @TrueElements he loved it when he realized it was "ocd the game"
[3:20:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> Is this a corona shopping simulator?
[3:20:11] <%StaceMcGate> How many planets has Earth colonized at this point?
[3:20:15] <$megamonmon123> i think I like this more than 2016
[3:20:17] <CrazyMedicine> oh
[3:20:17] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt the chainsaw was also a weapon you had to switch to instead of insant use button
[3:20:20] <Shishi1205> something exploded
[3:20:21] <$megamonmon123> every level is fucking intense
[3:20:21] <TheFranss> wut

[3:20:36] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @MyNameIsRasus Nope not yet
[3:20:37] <Shishi1205> hayden hasnt been found yet

[3:20:40] <KinduVborrd> THIS GAME HAS LIVES?!
[3:20:42] <%StaceMcGate> @dekkitout nah, we have Mars for sure. Just wondering how far Earth has gone
[3:20:42] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> explody guy

[3:21:07] <%GeneralSCPatton> ARC is javing a bad day
[3:21:16] <%tusk102> @KinduVborrd you can respawn infinitely at checkpoints but the lives instant revive you
[3:21:17] <Hitechnic> Did he ever realize he missed the secret under the airplane?
[3:21:24] <+taggerung403> argent energy ammo or something
[3:21:24] <%dekkitout> Yea, Earth's so fucked we go from +1 with Mars, to -2 with Earth and Mars going down the drain
[3:21:25] <daigotsuarezu> slow while in air is op

[3:38:57] <Shishi1205> Does blood punch have a comand?
[3:39:04] <Shishi1205> Or is it just melee
[3:39:06] <%Meekest> Most of this playthrough commentary is "there we go" and "FUCK"
[3:39:16] <$megamonmon123> @shishi1205 just melee
[3:39:20] <Shishi1205> k
[3:39:26] <+green715> Fun Fact: Part of the music for this area is a remix of Hayden's theme from 16
[3:39:34] <%SpicyVibration> What difficulty is he playing on?
[3:39:42] <LocalRobyn> oh is he out of his sleeves again? hell yeah
[3:39:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @Meekest Don't forget "You go to hell!" lol

[3:39:59] <%Manjove> SO COOL LOOKING
[3:40:23] <Kidbizzaro> The speed runs are going to be ridiculous
[3:40:33] <Shishi1205> ultra violence?
[3:40:40] <+sixcubit> ridiculous. if i were the demon i would simply not die
[3:40:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @Kidbizzaro OMG i cant wait
[3:40:51] <Reizie_Etherealm> The circle strafe game is SO STRONG
[3:40:57] <tri3dgE027> This is just a FPS character action at this point sarueiLul
[3:40:59] <abuse_of_juice> pinky is harder in this one
[3:41:05] <Saltmeisterr> @Kidbizzaro if theres no major skips like in 2016
[3:41:07] <LocalRobyn> can't wait to get this 20 years later :)
[3:41:15] <+mechslayer71> @tri3dge027 That’s what 2016 was too LUL
[3:41:20] <Shishi1205> Arachno bitch
[3:41:25] <Saltmeisterr> the 2016 speedrun is mostly just skipping whole levels
[3:41:29] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @tri3dgE027 <3 <3 <3
[3:41:45] <+lethallylactic> SourPls
[3:41:49] <%thesyndrome> @PatStaresAt check the map after the fight, you missed a rune back when you jumped down just before this arena
[3:41:49] <+taggerung403> the ultra nightmare 100% speedruns are where its at
[3:41:55] <MasterTonberry23> No kill like overkill
[3:41:56] <HyperBomb21> Doom isnt DMC but as an FPS, DMC is Doom but as ahack and slash game
[3:41:57] <tri3dgE027> @mechslayer71 It didn't have the air dash move though sarueiLul
[3:41:58] <%valriot> @PatStaresAt Remember you do have frag grenades and they dont share a cooldown with ice bombs
[3:42:04] <TheFranss> No kill like overkill
[3:42:05] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt you're doing great Pat, just need to use frag grenades more often.
[3:42:09] <+lethallylactic> Pump this soundtrack right into my veins
[3:42:09] <MasterTonberry23> Errybody dead
[3:42:12] <SomeOtherNeb> Chat, does this one have less collectibles everywhere on the map? I stopped playing Doom cause I'd spend 15 minutes clearing a level, and then 20 finding all the secrets since they gave permanent bonuses...
[3:42:16] <%Manjove> BLIND
[3:42:16] <Shishi1205> Wait what frags don't share CD?
[3:42:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> Overkill is an understatement

[4:12:24] <awalr> "you can't just shoot a hole in mars" "haha bfg go boom"
[4:12:26] <%KitsuneManami> Because Hayden isn't a BAD GUY just dum
[4:12:30] <%kyh9> Slayer to Hayden: I came here to laugh at you
[4:12:33] <dukenux> So what happened to Hayden between DOOM 2016 and now
[4:12:38] <Stroll> OBJECTIVE: Shoot a hole in Mars
[4:12:41] <%Valdorick> When asked for a we, said personal only said "OOP"
[4:12:43] <$floralkami> "Bitch, watch me"
[4:12:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yaaay

[4:12:54] <%XzileGaming> BAT TUR REE
[4:12:57] <AjaniMentorOfHeros> Hayden is actually trying to do good, but he's not good at it.
[4:12:59] <%OkamiDude15> Hayden’s internal monologue : HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
[4:12:59] <Shishi1205> get one coin yeah then another for a crystal?
[4:13:00] <+Eddy21forsaken> bat-ter-ry
[4:13:01] <Zebroneath> Next level is probably my favorite level
[4:13:01] <%Jhylla81> Nuke the planet from orbit. Problem solved
[4:13:02] <%YakumoYomi> BAT-TER-RIES
[4:13:02] <+Sestren413> the coins are the least valuable
[4:13:03] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> both sentinal coins
[4:13:05] <+Sestren413> finish the mods
[4:13:19] <%SkyPirateArcane> That Knight Armor is pretty dope though
[4:13:24] <MAX116030> can you skip animation?
[4:13:25] <ithirstforfreddurst> ice ice baby
[4:13:27] <%Niney_Who> Pat doesn't switch gun mods tho
[4:13:33] <%Niney_Who> So coins are worth more to him
[4:13:34] <Oxybe> Hayden made a big try, but he big stumbo.
[4:13:37] <SleepyMaribo> Hayden: You cant just shoot a hole in mars, Slayer: Thats where your wrong fuck Boi!
[4:13:38] <%thesyndrome> @SkyPirateArcane doom 1 armour >>>> the rest
[4:13:43] <King_Wolf_Rigger> Noice
[4:13:45] <Reizie_Etherealm> I'm not sure I like the bucket helmet but they're pretty cool
[4:13:49] <dukenux> So this dude jast hangs out in your locker?
[4:13:51] <$megamonmon123> toss a coin to your doomer
[4:13:51] <%KitsuneManami> @PatStaresAt Switch Doom comes with Isabelle Armor DLC, would you biuy it?
[4:13:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> We doind another level tonight?
[4:14:00] <%WhereIsWill> toss a coin to your slayer, or demons a plenty
[4:14:00] <Gruntini> OG Doomguy helmet rules
[4:14:02] <%hmgirlpopuri> I like to think that part of Hayden appreciates Doom Guy's totally disregard for bureaucracy
[4:14:03] <%Manjove> OH DEMON OF PLENTY
[4:14:07] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Precious antique coin
[4:14:10] <Tha_Mik> What a dumb question
[4:14:17] <+Gutsandlove> of course
[4:14:20] <TalisKanju> What's with the Animal Crossing/DOOM jokes
[4:14:22] <+Eddy21forsaken> have the radio be just isabelle talking
[4:14:26] <%EtheralFlameX> microwave sucks
[4:14:33] <%DRAGKUDO> I really hope they do some kind of crossover dlc for AC and Doom
[4:14:34] <KatabolicRage> man I got the microwave beam first and it was 1000% less cool than I imagined
[4:14:34] <$megamonmon123> microwave beam bad
[4:14:36] <%KitsuneManami> VERY lol
[4:14:37] <+pectusumbra> @TalisKanju they came out the same day
[4:14:37] <%Niney_Who> Microwave has tubes
[4:14:38] <Oxybe> AC/DOOM have a very friendly worl
[4:14:38] <j0ustar> Isabelle ripping & tearing in the name of Nook
[4:14:39] <%StaceMcGate> Just IMDB this game, The Khan Makyr is voiced by Nika Futterman, not Cree Summers
[4:14:41] <SevenDeadlyCyns> @TalisKanju they came out on the same day, that's it
[4:14:41] <%KitsuneManami> Heat Wave is just BETTER
[4:14:42] <SleepyMaribo> heat blast is the better one
[4:14:42] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I want Anka Armor DLC
[4:14:45] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> blue and no-blue
[4:14:45] <%SpicyVibration> it's blue yo
[4:14:46] <Oxybe> working relatiknship
[4:14:47] <SleepyMaribo> it just kills everything
[4:14:48] <$megamonmon123> heat wave is super better
[4:14:48] <MAX116030> the lights on the gun is the diffrence
[4:14:50] <TalisKanju> Oh ok, that makes sense
[4:14:50] <%TheActuallyGuy> wasted mod
[4:14:52] <Shishi1205> You have music to listen too @PatStaresAt
[4:14:53] <$floralkami> @taliskanju they released near the same day, and the fanbases of both got together
[4:14:55] <Zebroneath> Microwave is only fine when you use it on almost dead enemies.
[4:14:57] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @TalisKanju have you been living under a rock for the past 5 months?
[4:14:57] <TheFranss> I guess the color blue is good indicator
[4:14:58] <rafaelba93> its SHIT
[4:15:02] <+dirtyh4rr1> to the ripatorium!
[4:15:03] <Virokwet> one's more blue
[4:15:06] <+Ellila> So what other armor skins are there besides the old school one and the hideous unicorn one?
[4:15:06] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt microwave is good against single targets
[4:15:09] <KatabolicRage> microwave beam is pretty bad tbh

[4:16:09] <%SirGO0SE> SourPls psaDab sipsipDab SourPls
[4:16:09] <Mister_McDerp> so it does suck
[4:16:12] <bigbreh> @Eddy21forsaken In the lore its his prison for the demons lmao
[4:16:12] <Reizie_Etherealm> He keep demons in his basement so he can kill them for fun LUL
[4:16:14] <%Nobrev> you need to let the bar fill
[4:16:19] <Saltmeisterr> Yea it stunlocks
[4:16:20] <Oxybe> @silvery_cricket he's the descendant of wolfenstein guy and commander keen.
[4:16:24] <Stroll> 1v1 it might be good
[4:16:27] <TheFranss> It seems to stunlock but has VERY limited range
[4:16:27] <%Valdorick> Its so bad
[4:16:29] <$floralkami> @dukenux captured? you think he takes prisoners???
[4:16:30] <$megamonmon123> if you let the green bar get full on a demon they die instantly
[4:16:31] <heartlesshealer> STUNLOCKING <3
[4:16:32] <Reizie_Etherealm> At the very least it stun locks the target
[4:16:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Its made to stun not kill
[4:16:35] <+Pookiedaexzile> I Thought DubStep was trash chat? Kappa
[4:16:36] <%dekkitout> Oh, it stuns the robits
[4:16:36] <%SpicyVibration> If it killed everyone from a distance there would be no need to use anything else
[4:16:38] <%hmgirlpopuri> I love how Vega is still nice and respectful to Dr. Hayden but is totally in Doom Guy's camp now
[4:16:53] <Shishi1205> grenades
[4:16:53] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp
[4:16:54] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt if the green bar fills while using microwave the demon pops instantly
[4:16:56] <$megamonmon123> i expect hayden to betray us again
[4:16:56] <dukenux> @floralkami to kill them later as a target practice, yes
[4:16:57] <%SirGO0SE> i freaking love when the beepboop from low health happen and it sound like the beat drop
[4:16:58] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I suggest yo use it on bigger guys as a stun
[4:16:59] <+zaibatsu_member_333> ***
[4:16:59] <%StaceMcGate> Vega is good boi
[4:17:00] <+SH1NK1R0> Doom commercial on my doom stream smh
[4:17:05] <+zaibatsu_member_333> VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo VoHiYo
[4:17:05] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> chat i missed the last 10 mins
[4:17:08] <%Manjove> is the Ripatorium required for an unlock?
[4:17:08] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> what is he doing?
[4:17:09] <+rxspicychicken> @Oxybe no commander keen and doom guy are decendants of wolfenstein guy.
[4:17:17] <%tusk102> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries you missed hayden talking
[4:17:20] <heartlesshealer> your extra lives get used up in the ripatorium?
[4:17:23] <Mister_McDerp> WASTED LIFE
[4:17:27] <%StaceMcGate> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries we blowing up Mars with the BFG-10000
[4:17:27] <MAX116030> that BEAM is BAD because its stunlocks and pends all ammo on one enemy to kill
[4:17:28] <$floralkami> @dukenux naw, that would be too kind and considerate of their time
[4:17:31] <%SirGO0SE> psaBig
[4:17:36] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The Ripatorium and the Tearnasium
[4:17:42] <bigbreh> Lives dont get used up in the ripatorium
[4:17:46] <%tusk102> @MAX116030 which is why it's great for bosses and NOTHING else
[4:17:59] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries Just watch
[4:17:59] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> wait so why is he doing the ripatorium atm?
[4:18:00] <%moogleboy1984> Remake HeXen in this style
[4:18:02] <+rxspicychicken> is patt playing on baby mode?
[4:18:02] <Saltmeisterr> how is beam upgraded?
[4:18:04] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[4:18:11] <MasterTonberry23> @fruit_pie_the_magician Right next to the Sexnasium
[4:18:11] <+zaibatsu_member_333> shut up sit down an watch
[4:18:17] <heartlesshealer> okay, so the just repurposed the "extra life" thing for the "you can't die in the ripatorium" feature
[4:18:18] <dukenux> Also it's litteraly called "Demon jail(or prison)" - watched Joel play D:E, and he was dissapointed it's a training room, not just a jail, with locked up demons you can smack around LUL
[4:18:20] <%Manjove> dont you mean the Teareseum
[4:18:25] <Zebroneath> Microwave charge is dependent on enemies current health.
[4:18:27] <$floralkami> @rxspicychicken no, tryhard
[4:18:32] <%SpicyVibration> those boobie are going to get us banned
[4:18:36] <EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries> yeah fine i'm sure all will be explained
[4:18:48] <awalr> i encountered the best bug with this gun, the Precision Bolt started firing in full auto as fast as micro missiles
[4:18:49] <%TheActuallyGuy> EVEN FULLY UPGRADED, MICROWAVE SUCKS.
[4:18:51] <Shishi1205> did he headbut him?
[4:19:00] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @TalisKanju ok... welll... Doom Eternal and Animal Crossing New Horizons were scheduled to release on the same day. The respective fanbases responded to this news in a sort of wholesome crossover kind of thing. mostly with art showing Doomguy and Isabelle being best friends
[4:19:02] <MAX116030> that BEAM is BAD because its stunlocks and pends all ammo on one enemy to kill
[4:19:03] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt low enemy HP dies faster to it
[4:19:06] <@commanderclaw> The less health the less ammo it takes
[4:19:08] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt microwave is only good against single enemies
[4:19:10] <LocalRobyn> jesus I'm really gonna need to chill out with some minecraft after this
[4:19:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Low health LESS AMMO TO KILL
[4:19:15] <bigbreh> Microwave sucks cause it slows your movement down
[4:19:18] <%Nobrev> it means if the meter fills up the enemy dies
[4:19:21] <%Niney_Who> Yeah but Big enemy means big boom
[4:19:21] <dukenux> @Niney_Who That's all weapons tho
[4:19:27] <daigotsuarezu> keys
[4:19:28] <%Valdorick> Its a long range, cast time glory kill that's really bad.
[4:19:30] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SHOOT A HOLE IN MARS LUL
[4:19:31] <%linkster291> Damaged enemies will have a a more filled gauge.
[4:19:31] <%Niney_Who> so weaken big enemy then use it on em for big boom
[4:19:34] <%tusk102> use bfg to shoot mars
[4:19:40] <ExpressNode> Give Mars a new asshole
[4:19:41] <+silvery_cricket> y
[4:19:43] <MasterTonberry23> Get your ass to Mars, and then shoot a hole into it
[4:19:43] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @EatTheB0otyLikeGroceries What you missed was the start of the real game ***
[4:19:45] <%SpicyVibration> psaHoldon
[4:19:46] <+Sestren413> r u a bad enough dude to shoot a hole in mars?
[4:19:46] <%StaceMcGate> We're gonna blow up the declaration of Independence

[4:51:02] <%tusk102> There is gravity because he is in mars gravity field guys
[4:51:08] <%Valdorick> Close
[4:51:08] <Shishi1205> close

[4:51:41] <heartlesshealer> oh boy
[4:51:42] <%SpicyVibration> ACKTUALLY They are in orbit around mars so there should be no apparent gravity
[4:51:46] <+chaumiester> @floralkami OOF... that explains a lot

[5:01:49] <+Pookiedaexzile> Yeah offer that bitch water Paige
[5:01:53] <%SvenHolgersson> Hey Pat you been reading JoJolion? Shit is getting HYPE AND WEIRD
[5:02:04] <CitrousCt> Is Doom Eternal good?
[5:02:05] <kingbaconcrispy> Man, Pat has that house wife game on lock. Where can I get a Paige?
[5:02:05] <%rdark_ksu> FUCK YES LEFTOVERS! My fridge is like half tupperware
[5:02:09] <nerdblase> Spaghetti Carbonara is where it's at.
[5:02:09] <pipboy344> GET BACK TO THE GAME
[5:02:10] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I would blow up Mars in a second for a good plate of spaghetti
[5:02:12] <Shishi1205> You can do it both ways
[5:02:12] <King_Wolf_Rigger> I can't fucking wait till MuHut starts working on his designs of these demons
[5:02:16] <Shishi1205> that's the fun

[5:02:43] <farrellcityking> Paige feeds the Pat
[5:02:49] <%Aracon_> psaBig monies
[5:02:51] <%StatistX> This is so evil. Pat eats at a time where it's way too late for me to eat, but also late enough that I'm hungry again
[5:02:52] <%DRAGKUDO> give him a bib
[5:03:00] <nerdblase> Cacio a Pepe is also reasonable.
[5:03:10] <%GeneralSCPatton> @corporate_redeemer Yeah, but there's a 30% service charge if you want it fresh. Delivering live enemies is hard.

[5:04:54] <fabo_joyful> cooking with vodka real
[5:04:57] <IminyourBase> it's real you chode
[5:04:59] <dukenux> @PatStaresAt it's real, vodka apparently brings out new flavors in tomatoes
[5:05:17] <Ozmodyas> Penne ala Vodka is a real food, just not real Italian food. Those wacky Americans invented that shit.
[5:05:18] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> isnt that to break their spine?
[5:05:24] <%StatistX> My homemade Jack daniels BBQ sauce is the best, but the whole house stinks like it's a hobos saturday night

[5:06:57] <%OkamiDude15> She also speaks English
[5:06:57] <+AllenDeadman> what we don't like is the sound of food being chewed

[5:10:56] <%DesuDesuDokiDoki> yay
[5:11:00] <Leddy_at_Home> Yeah, the only reason GameStop hasn't shut down is cause they literally can't stop selling
[5:11:00] <%JJCheeker> anyone even go there anyway
[5:11:01] <+RowenCleric> i like my local EBgames too... so I feel for the smaller stores

[5:11:07] <King_Wolf_Rigger> @hntronium I'm sorry, what? Please explain.
[5:11:11] <CookieDoughFK> But Reggie will save gamestop!
[5:11:12] <dukenux> TBF i don't think Reggie even had a chance to do anything before this shit hit
[5:11:14] <%Aracon_> most of the employees are a bunch of fresh teens anyway
[5:11:16] <%Mr_Strut> On the plus side, they never have to work for gamestop again
[5:11:17] <TonberryLives> That leaked memo probably didn't help
[5:11:17] <+Prinny_Raider> damn I they got my pre order for re3 :(
[5:11:19] <NeekOleek> it wasn't all of them it was only the ones that refused. the one right next to my GNC is going to never open again lol
[5:11:22] <+Ell1ot> Dey TUK DER JEBS
[5:11:22] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dammit I still have a preorder! Gamestop isn't allowed to go bankrupt until I get that shit!
[5:11:22] <%michingmallecho> So we’re all dead
[5:11:24] <anglebreakfast> GS didn't close, its stopped customers from coming in
[5:11:26] <RichochetForce> The leaked memo is damning

[5:11:27] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt How far have you gotten? I just jumped into the stream.
[5:11:28] <+JadeBrkr> That's for taking away my Kingdom Hearts 3 PS4 Pro

[5:11:30] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @CookieDoughFK Surre PokMachamp
[5:11:30] <%Deadpal> I was takling with someone from gamestop 3 weeks ago. They were arguing that gamestop was fine and they were selling more than ever.
[5:11:37] <TurtlesAndTentacles> WAIT NO THEY GOT MY MONEY FOR FF7 FUCKKKKKKKK
[5:11:37] <RichochetForce> That company is abusing the fuck out of its employees
[5:11:38] <%StaceMcGate> Reggie will gut Gamestop for its assets before selling it off a la Mick Romney
[5:11:39] <+Neoepochx> Word
[5:11:41] <%Spydurman> Gamestop will only survive if it converts itself into a gaming corner/VR game place or something
[5:11:42] <%michingmallecho> I never preorder from GameStop. Amazon my Judas

[5:12:13] <hntronium> @King_Wolf_Rigger There's a section on dlsite dedicated to a Voice category
[5:12:21] <$floralkami> @persona_is_datingsimtrash true, but you could still just order them

[5:39:10] <%tusk102> the black evil
[5:39:17] <+Neoepochx> @hntronium Plague is...not great at a lot of games. Good art tho.

[5:39:34] <Shishi1205> to test you
[5:39:34] <1matheuw> to protect the keys
[5:39:35] <+GeneralHysterics> because it's a video game

[5:39:42] <gekizenbu> TO TEST YOUR ABILITIES
[5:39:43] <RyanTheRecluse> that's a rough one
[5:39:43] <+Neoepochx> Why does any of this stuff lying around for Doomboi exist?
[5:39:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because UAC is copying the tech?
[5:39:44] <+loukemia83> because video games
[5:39:45] <KingSpunf> They look like something from fuckin Darksiders
[5:39:46] <%necrocannibal2> the beginning of RE6 sucks then the end is like the beginning

[5:40:20] <%tusk102> @PatStaresAt hey pat are you gonna replay re6 when re8 comes out Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa
[5:40:24] <%Valdorick> Unlocked the key
[5:40:25] <%SoFarFetched> @hntronium oh yeah I don't doubt,but just thinking back to Pat earlier talking about Plague's gameplay and him being mad about the dash since Plague doesnt' like platformers.

[5:40:45] <+zaibatsu_member_333> @SoFarFetched I was just trying to make a friend oh well Enjoy Life *waves*
[5:40:49] <Reizie_Etherealm> I wonder if Jake is gonna get another appearance in future RE games
[5:40:51] <parliecharker> Playing the level where the objective is Get Samuel Hayden. Is this what Meth feels like?
[5:41:03] <$floralkami> @sofarfetched you would think he noticed in the gameplay trailers, but I guess now
[5:41:07] <$floralkami> noy
[5:41:09] <+Neoepochx> @SoFarFetched The Dash is one of the best parts about this game.
[5:41:10] <$floralkami> not
[5:41:13] <$floralkami> fuck
[5:41:14] <+Neoepochx> I'm floored.

[5:41:33] <+GenesisKnight> Doom guy was in Champions wasn' the?
[5:41:34] <+Neoepochx> Andrew is a God.
[5:41:34] <%OkamiDude15> Weird the key didn’t spawn for me when I played the level nkoThink
[5:41:34] <%necrocannibal2> Plague with terrible opinions about videogames? that's new
[5:41:42] <%SoFarFetched> @floralkami nah I figured what you meant was not LUL and well I guess he didn't think there was going to be a lot. I don't remember how much the game trailers showed.
[5:41:42] <+zaibatsu_member_333> I'm off to play Monster GenU Enjoy the stream
[5:41:45] <%SpicyVibration> Vinyl is

[5:41:50] <+Neoepochx> @Double_Tap_That That song they picked is incredible
[5:41:50] <%Ner234> Some bullshit most likely LUL
[5:41:50] <BlackOrchidKI> @GenesisKnight Along with B.J. from Wolfenstein, yes
[5:41:51] <+GeneralHysterics> The slayer gates are always so fun

[5:42:05] <$floralkami> literally spitting on the floor at the thought of using TRICKSTER in his video game
[5:42:09] <%necrocannibal2> it's actually really good
[5:42:10] <King_Wolf_Rigger> VIRGIL HERE
[5:42:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIG BOI
[5:42:11] <%OkamiDude15> 5 marauders at the same time evo19MindBlown
[5:42:13] <%SoFarFetched> @Neoepochx The dashing does look pretty cool though when you jump onto things. It would however make me feel sick I bet with my motion sickness.
[5:42:14] <%necrocannibal2> the soundtrack of Champions, that is
[5:42:14] <person181> more like 'welcome to hell'
[5:42:15] <%Reevesypoo> Youre already there PAt
[5:42:18] <$floralkami> is what Plague did
[5:42:19] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 whenever i hear plagues opinions they make me wanna fuckin die like his hate for bloodborne bc "the dash is a godly mega ability" as if rolling in bloodborne wasn't the same
[5:42:23] <MAX116030> Oh that guy is a trouble alone
[5:42:28] <hntronium> @SoFarFetched He doesn't think any of the upgrades like Loot Magnet are good either. So his opinions aren't just bad, they're also wrong.
[5:42:32] <+GeneralHysterics> That's too many marauders
[5:42:32] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> plague hates bloodborne?
[5:42:33] <hntronium> Normally I'm okay with him but his streams of Eternal are just insufferable.
[5:42:43] <%StaceMcGate> Five Marauders at the same time? Post that Pipper Perri image
[5:42:45] <+GeneralHysterics> I can barely deal with one, lol
[5:42:46] <CrazyMedicine> ??
[5:42:47] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 i meant "rolling in dark souls"
[5:42:53] <%SpicyVibration> Plague only hates the things he loves
[5:42:54] <%OkamiDude15> It’s not but could you imagine nkoLUL
[5:42:55] <%Ner234> I don't even want to know what the last Slayer Gate looks like. LUL
[5:42:58] <+Neoepochx> @SoFarFetched yeah, if you have motion sickness it would really suck, but it makes the traversal and options you have for fights..SO good.
[5:43:04] <Saltmeisterr> oh shit is that a makyr drone?
[5:43:12] <%ArcanumMBD> Use Super Shotgun to stun, then swap to Ballista and blast em before he recovers
[5:43:13] <%dekkitout> Doesn't Plague hate anything the average pedestrian would enjoy mildly?
[5:43:13] <%tusk102> @Ner234 15 tyrants stacked on top of each other obviously
[5:43:17] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> SPOILER
[5:43:20] <Shishi1205> ??
[5:43:20] <CrazyMedicine> What

[5:43:24] <Reizie_Etherealm> The OROKIN??
[5:43:25] <+Neoepochx> Nice
[5:43:27] <%mortalitas87> looks like a spoiler
[5:43:27] <Tucker0603> spoiler is that
[5:43:28] <%necrocannibal2> @tusk102 yep. also "bloodborne is too easy because you can regen health" while at the same time "they made bloodborne too hard because you can regen health". I don't take his opinions on videogames seriously at all.
[5:43:28] <%Valdorick> ENEMY PREVEIW
[5:43:28] <%Ner234> @tusk102 Only 15? Easy Kappa
[5:43:28] <%SoFarFetched> @hntronium this does feel like a game that will either very hit or miss for people. It definitely shows the hit and the miss depending on who is streaming it.
[5:43:29] <%tusk102> @dekkitout plague hates bloodborne
[5:43:30] <%linkster291> A Spoiler that's what.
[5:43:32] <RyanTheRecluse> pop the head

[5:43:40] <%dekkitout> Yeah- so I stand corrected LUL
[5:43:42] <%ArcanumMBD> lol Marauder cockblocking the glory kill
[5:43:43] <+Neoepochx> Headshots will net HUGE health and amo
[5:43:44] <KingSpunf> Sentient Inbound
[5:43:45] <%OkamiDude15> I haven’t seen that dude yet
[5:43:52] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> spoiler LUL
[5:43:55] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 "you can regen so it's too easy. but also you can regen so the game is too hard"
[5:43:59] <boomstickery> that drone looks like shes called Karen
[5:44:06] <dking0000> Headshot for big loot explosion
[5:44:07] <$floralkami> Plague, now able to rip and tear his hardest ever: "WHY DO I HAVE TO USE A DASH? I DON'T WANT LOOT TO AUTO COLLECT EITHER"
[5:44:11] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt hit it with a headshot and you get basically a refill of health and amo.
[5:44:20] <Saltmeisterr> oh so makyrs are bees huh
[5:44:21] <CrazyMedicine> No health monkaS
[5:44:22] <boomstickery> chill and kill

[5:44:30] <King_Wolf_Rigger> What shit
[5:44:31] <Saltmeisterr> bee angel
[5:44:33] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 it's almost like too easy and too hard makes the thing... BALANCED?!?!?!
[5:44:35] <+Neoepochx> @floralkami What terrible takes Plague has. DOOM HAS ALWAYS HAD AUTO PICKUP ON LOOT
[5:44:38] <Shishi1205> PIÑATA
[5:44:38] <%SoFarFetched> @Neoepochx yeah motion sickness for games I want to play sucks. Depending on the game I can slowly get used to it,but I need to take breaks. I CANNOT do Half Life though LUL
[5:44:40] <%OkamiDude15> That dog summon is a problem for me
[5:44:40] <%Valdorick> Oh wow, loot pinetas
[5:44:40] <%Ner234> Wow that's a lot
[5:44:46] <+fizzguy47> Damn
[5:44:48] <%necrocannibal2> @tusk102 basically LUL
[5:44:49] <%realm_forge> USE THOSE ROCKETS
[5:44:50] <%OkamiDude15> Sick
[5:44:57] <SilverFaustX> theres somuch going on
[5:44:59] <%SpicyVibration> pop
[5:44:59] <zocano> arbalest is an excellent way to deal with marauders
[5:45:00] <CursedNobleman> nice!
[5:45:03] <jmepik> Pat's gotta get an alpha rotation going
[5:45:04] <%necrocannibal2> NICE
[5:45:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> Plague has the trashiest opinions on games. His opinion is only valid for Dragon Ball and WAHMENS
[5:45:13] <+Neoepochx> Makyr Drones are the VERY defenition of Fodder Enemy LUL
[5:45:18] <jmepik> shotty, arbalest, sticky shot
[5:45:19] <+HazMat997> Marauders can actually go fuck themselves
[5:45:20] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 also the fact that he hates dark souls 2 and dark souls 3 strictly because they are... SEQUELS?!?! HOW DARE THEY HAVE ITEMS FROM PREVIOUS GAMES
[5:45:25] <$floralkami> WOMBO COMBO
[5:45:46] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 these games that have the same names in a numbered series should all be totally self contained and have no crossover smh
[5:45:47] <$floralkami> @tusk102 wait, seriously?
[5:45:59] <CrazyMedicine> They're your health
[5:45:59] <%fattness132> The drones are loot pinatas
[5:46:06] <1matheuw> please glory kill him now
[5:46:09] <%Valdorick> "Aw man, he keeps attacking me when I'm at midrange, damn this zoning bastard"
[5:46:12] <%tusk102> @floralkami that's not the only reason he dislikes them but one of his main reasons is that he thinks they should all have nothing to do with each other
[5:46:14] <%realm_forge> USE ROCKETS
[5:46:26] <+Neoepochx> The SSG/Ballista Combo is so good, but I need to pick the right keybinds for it.
[5:46:34] <%ArcanumMBD> Pat you can shoot the Marauder a second time while he's stunned from the first shot
[5:46:37] <KatabolicRage> I've found success countering him with the ballista
[5:46:43] <jmepik> keybinds are CRITICAL in doom
[5:46:44] <+fizzguy47> can you shoot twics
[5:46:45] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt Aim at his legs if you glory kill
[5:46:49] <Morsuzado> bluud born
[5:46:50] <Sloavon> woah why is he so fast???
[5:46:54] <jmepik> first game to make me seriously reconsider WASD
[5:46:54] <+Neoepochx> @PatStaresAt You can get an extra shot in if you stun him.
[5:46:54] <$floralkami> maybe this is why Plague is now branded a DBZ guy, cause those are the only opinions of his that don't suck
[5:46:55] <+Seiryu99> do energy weapons not work on his shield?
[5:47:00] <+Sestren413> you CAN damage him with indirect fire but its hard
[5:47:03] <%SpicyVibration> that was free
[5:47:04] <+HazMat997> @Seiryu99 nope
[5:47:07] <warmnoid> parry parry psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace
[5:47:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Seiryu99 NOPE
[5:47:08] <+FoolsArcade> BGF??
[5:47:10] <+GeneralHysterics> Remote detonation rockets can get around the shield but it's usually more trouble than it's worth
[5:47:11] <+TheShisno> Stagger window is long enough for two super shots
[5:47:12] <RyanTheRecluse> arbalest is best against him
[5:47:13] <jmepik> he takes zero damage unless parried
[5:47:14] <%realm_forge> Shoot them at his feet
[5:47:14] <KingSpunf> explosive barrels?
[5:47:18] <%Valdorick> Aw, Lame glory kill
[5:47:26] <+Neoepochx> I love fighting the Marauder.
[5:47:27] <%OkamiDude15> @sloavon marauders are former night sentinels who sided with hell and the mayker
[5:47:33] <%SpicyVibration> shoot him with gun!
[5:47:34] <%Niney_Who> @PatStaresAt The best glory kill on them is where you are in front and aim at legs/feet.
[5:47:41] <%dekkitout> Ah shoot- this reminds me of Warframe's Scarlet Spear event...
[5:47:42] <$floralkami> *sigh* now all is well
[5:47:57] <Shishi1205> Actually marauders are sentiels that died and were resurrected by makyr
[5:47:58] <%necrocannibal2> @tusk102 I actually see a lot of people with that opinion when it comes to DS3. though to be fair, it's because DS2 mentions DS1 very little so it changed expectations.
[5:48:10] <Sloavon> @OkamiDude15 oh, so Not Doomguys
[5:48:12] <+Neoepochx> I think tihis is the final wave for this gate?
[5:48:16] <+Double_Tap_That> @neoepochx Even on Nightmare?
[5:48:24] <+Neoepochx> Never mind.
[5:48:26] <jaygee303> Bfg
[5:48:26] <hntronium> God, I just want a full on PVP of this. Like Quake
[5:48:30] <$floralkami> I wish there was a glory kill of Doomguy taking Hunter's horn and beating him with it
[5:48:32] <%OkamiDude15> Oh really? I thought the ones that died just got sent to the soulnado
[5:48:37] <+Neoepochx> @Double_Tap_That I recently just finished UV with like...15 extra lives.
[5:48:42] <+Neoepochx> I need to play again on Nightmare.
[5:48:53] <$floralkami> like, multiple stabby stabs to the face
[5:48:56] <%Ner234> It just keeps going...
[5:48:58] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 ds2 mentions ds1 constantly. the old countries and stuff return, and you even find solaires statue. also the 4 primal lords have the ds1 lord souls
[5:49:01] <NeroInfinite> The BFG just being on the weapon wheel is great
[5:49:06] <+GeneralHysterics> these fights always feel like they last forever and end too soon, it's wild
[5:49:08] <SilverFaustX> soo doomguy is killin them to pay off his debt to tom nook ?
[5:49:14] <CrazyMedicine> This is hard
[5:49:24] <%dekkitout> So what's the over-under that someone did a model rip of the Marauder and modded it into a skin?
[5:49:26] <+Neoepochx> @SilverFaustX Daisy got into huge debt.
[5:49:27] <gekizenbu> @SilverFaustX do you know how many bells the Fortress of Doom is worth?

[5:49:57] <+Pookiedaexzile> The color coding in this game is a big step up from the last. if only someone was an art student who also just got done playing that last game
[5:49:57] <Kouseo> how far are we
[5:49:58] <%Mornaka> I don't think i was blinking during that
[5:49:59] <%za7az> Worst game ever
[5:50:00] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 plagues problem isn't ds3's over reliance on ds1. his problem is that ds2 and ds1 even MENTION ds1. he thinks they should literally be in different universe that never intersect ever
[5:50:01] <KingSpunf> wow a glitch 6/10
[5:50:02] <+GenesisKnight> Doom Guy is in Gunslinger 90% of the time
[5:50:04] <NeroInfinite> Is this the ARC?
[5:50:07] <perez3579> @PatStaresAt you can shoot him twice whenever you stagger the marauder and the rockets remote detonation allows you to hit him with rockets from behind
[5:50:07] <$RealThiele> Todd howard did a bug
[5:50:10] <RavenHellkite> bethesda's trademark, bugs
[5:50:11] <SilverFaustX> RaccAttack rip n tear
[5:50:12] <King_Wolf_Rigger> You are playing Doom
[5:50:15] <TioXyco> a bug, in a bethesda game?noooooooooo
[5:50:17] <%Engwithan_Elder_God> Looking for a teleporter
[5:50:19] <KaiserMario> How's that Bethesda Net?
[5:50:25] <MasterTonberry23> Big question marks. Very Banjo Kazooie
[5:50:27] <$floralkami> UGH, GODDAMN IT BETHESDA Kappa
[5:50:27] <Shishi1205> up?
[5:50:27] <+Neoepochx> This game runs so god damn well.
[5:50:29] <%Aracon_> just fat video game question mark
[5:50:31] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> but it's too video gamey! doodHokey
[5:50:32] <%OkamiDude15> Doom is a gunslinger/trickster hybrid
[5:50:34] <+TheShisno> Not even Besthesda, an id glitch
[5:50:36] <+Neoepochx> Idtech 7 is a marvel.
[5:50:40] <Sloavon> 9/10 because of the bugs and jank
[5:50:45] <bendatron> it reminds me of tony hawk
[5:50:47] <MAX116030> Honestly Doom and Dante would make an awesome crossover
[5:50:49] <persona_is_datingsimtrash> i swear you guys are just like persona fans you play nothing but DMC
[5:50:49] <+TheShisno> Story in porn, amirite?
[5:50:52] <$floralkami> @theshisno yes, that's why I included a Kappa
[5:50:55] <Shishi1205> farm headshots pat
[5:51:05] <+Neoepochx> Next Smash Trailer is a double wombo combo of Dante/Doomguy rippin apart demons...
[5:51:08] <+Neoepochx> That would be cool...
[5:51:09] <Reizie_Etherealm> What are the challenges again?
[5:51:10] <+GeneralHysterics> Doom guy's sword master style is him punching things, he's just too strong to actually style on dudes
[5:51:12] <1matheuw> @persona_is_datingsimtrash you seem biased
[5:51:14] <Monkeyweed21> no
[5:51:14] <$RealThiele> i feel like those toy models are just the art they sent to funko
[5:51:15] <%hmgirlpopuri> Doomguy and Dante could discuss pizza preferences
[5:51:15] <%necrocannibal2> @tusk102 yeah, Plague's weird and it's not even because of the animal porn. LUL
[5:51:18] <+Neoepochx> You can't miss the green slayer poitns.
[5:51:18] <+Pookiedaexzile> Story in porn is the best, what porn ya;ll watching with bad characterdevelopment
[5:51:19] <+HazMat997> you missed a Codex and a battery
[5:51:20] <+GeneralHysterics> the only style doomguy is missing is royal guard
[5:51:21] <+Neoepochx> You just keep going.
[5:51:23] <hntronium> Dont think so
[5:51:24] <zocano> no, you're good
[5:51:25] <%linkster291> No, there is one last real fight before theend.
[5:51:29] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 the animal porn is the most normal part
[5:51:32] <%Manjove> the level isnt over
[5:51:33] <Sloavon> Doomguy has pizza in his room actually
[5:51:36] <person181> "myth" of the doomslayer
[5:51:39] <%WhereIsWill> when will we get final form bald pat?
[5:51:44] <AjaniMentorOfHeros> Lies!
[5:51:47] <%InugamiTheHound> Cortana?

[5:51:54] <+Neoepochx> UAC lady is thicc tho.
[5:51:55] <+HazMat997> thats level over
[5:51:56] <+TheShisno> Restart
[5:51:56] <KoiNoiYokan> Whats hes drinking chat?
[5:51:57] <$floralkami> @theshisno plus, if Bethesda wants to take credit for ID's history like they tried to do last game awards, they can take all of my vitriol too
[5:51:58] <%SpicyVibration> You got to be able to kill her eventually
[5:52:04] <+Neoepochx> The level is only over when you get the prompt for fast travel.
[5:52:05] <+HazMat997> you only get fast travel when level is over
[5:52:05] <%hmgirlpopuri> No fast travel yet, can't be almost over
[5:52:05] <%necrocannibal2> when is Woolie going to play this?
[5:52:08] <TurtlesAndTentacles> So who is that girl and why is she talking sit about Doom Slayer?
[5:52:09] <King_Wolf_Rigger> What's in the green one?
[5:52:10] <%linkster291> Nope you still got to fight on Marz
[5:52:14] <%tusk102> @necrocannibal2 i;ve never watched a full plague video because his opinions on stuff are so awful tbh
[5:52:27] <KoiNoiYokan> Is he playing on PC with a controller?
[5:52:30] <AjaniMentorOfHeros> Yeah Videogame!
[5:52:30] <%necrocannibal2> @tusk102 same, I mostly just watch his animations
[5:52:31] <+TheShisno> It's not over yet (Snake)
[5:52:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yep
[5:52:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> TIME FOR BEST LEVEL
[5:52:37] <MAX116030> I dont get people being pissed off about Doom having a story. Its not much in the way and sure make characters like Vega and Sam awesome addition
[5:52:39] <%Ner234> MARSSSS
[5:52:40] <%OkamiDude15> @koinoiyokan yes

[5:53:05] <$RealThiele> Hi Aaron De paul

[5:53:07] <%Marpolo13> ok
[5:53:10] <+HazMat997> This is DOOMS answer to you being able to terraform in New Horizons,
[5:53:13] <MasterTonberry23> I guess now its the Found City of Hebeth. (rim shot)
[5:53:14] <+Sestren413> it just keeps going
[5:53:16] <+Neoepochx> I love reading the metal stuff they write for these codices.

[5:53:48] <$floralkami> @turtlesandtentacles it's not real, but I'm hoping Vega gets a nice moment like that
[5:53:49] <%SpicyVibration> Mars is cold yo
[5:53:58] <%OkamiDude15> Naw hell is in a different dimension
[5:54:00] <$floralkami> Vega deserves it

[5:54:10] <BlackOrchidKI> @Neoepochx Not that kind of clansmen LUL
[5:54:12] <hntronium> Always point all the guns at the teleporter
[5:54:13] <$RealThiele> demons in this game are like Phyrexians

[5:55:01] <+twohitgood> you missed a secretit's the demo level
[5:55:07] <Reizie_Etherealm> That's pretty much Mass Effect's reasoning for the premise of needing mass relays with set destinations, to avoid going to god knows where
[5:55:12] <Saltmeisterr> SOURPLS
[5:55:17] <%Mornaka> this is a great track
[5:55:17] <majindusto> YOU GOT THE NAME WRONG PAT lol

[5:56:30] <+Neoepochx> It pops up with a big "INVALID TARGET"
[5:56:33] <chza> That’s such a good weapon wheel, why don’t more games move the wheel to the side instead of dead center
[5:56:33] <+TheShisno> No chainsaws on tol lads
[5:56:35] <+Neoepochx> Even with 3 fuel.
[5:56:44] <Saltmeisterr> super heavies can't be sawed
[5:56:48] <%bevyrage> i'm here
[5:56:49] <+Neoepochx> 3 Fuel can only hit heavies, not supers.
[5:56:52] <Saltmeisterr> BUT they can be sworded
[5:56:52] <AzirothTheGreat> well damn

[6:13:19] <Reizie_Etherealm> The last time I saw super technology and extreme religion co-exist was EYE divine cybermancy
[6:13:20] <Mister_McDerp> just like the UAC
[6:13:28] <Shishi1205> so argent energy really was hell energy
[6:13:39] <$floralkami> I wonder where that guy who was complaining about there being lore to read is
[6:13:45] <%Niney_Who> Power is corrupting
[6:13:46] <%Valdorick> Argent UAC

[6:13:59] <%BeatBo_2> the moment he saw em
[6:14:00] <+Javaa01> There's a reason Doomguy wanted Argent gone as bad as he did
[6:14:03] <%OkamiDude15> It keeps happening
[6:14:03] <Tucker0603> the makyrs weren't originally fucked up. they got greedy
[6:14:06] <%linkster291> Everyone gets addicted to Devil triggers
