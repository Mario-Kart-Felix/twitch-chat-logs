[1:20:27] <%rissaleigh14> Yes hydration is important
[1:20:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> If a dog will wedge their ass next to your ass when there's no room, but doesn't lick your face, that is a Space-Neutral alignment component.
[1:20:45] <+aeronauticaljon> There should be a emote just called 'I gotta Pee'
[1:20:47] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> sympathize at least, its 116 degrees here (like 40c)
[1:20:53] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> so ive been drinking my weight in water every day
[1:21:01] <%bluescreen1988> psaGief_TK
[1:21:14] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah cause Pat always mentions how he pees a lot more because he drinks a lot more water and coffee.
[1:21:22] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> HA okay 46* celsius
[1:21:22] <Pookiedaexzile> NotLikeThis "He hasn't even booted yet"

[1:22:38] <+frunkAF> what?
[1:22:41] <trianglehat> pp is a lie
[1:22:41] <%phantomsleeves> that’s fair
[1:22:42] <heartlesshealer> kiss dog is mandatory
[1:22:42] <%the_mental_punk> Hi everyone hows the stream?
[1:22:43] <%Starotter70> Don't pee in the Dogs Bowl Pat
[1:22:46] <%cowardlord> This is agreeable
[1:22:46] <%Aleate> psaJpeg
[1:22:47] <+Taglog7> While you pee?
[1:22:49] <+evbites> smoosh pupper
[1:22:50] <%penitentpentwitch> What's the longest time it's taken for Pat to get into gameplay?
[1:22:52] <%cowardman93> the smoosh face is so pretty
[1:22:54] <+frunkAF> did you kiss dog smush face while peeing?
[1:22:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> FACE MUST BE SMUSH
[1:22:56] <transporterthesequel> Yeah we know
[1:23:00] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @dekkitout Obscure humor is just humor you haven't met yet.
[1:23:00] <%damienlunas> @Starotter70 that's how he got his penis bit
[1:23:05] <heartlesshealer> sounds right
[1:23:10] <%cowardman93> yeah like several hours
[1:23:15] <%MassConnect> what about the Dragon Age?
[1:23:16] <%lemon_rinds> Always gotta smoosh that face
[1:23:18] <FutaSnek> Man that long prestream really.... BUGGED ME. eh? eeh?
[1:23:18] <oniwahoo> What stream is that? I need to watch that one lol
[1:23:20] <%RoggleJr> Dragon Age?
[1:23:20] <ha2ken> But RE7 begin yeyeyeye
[1:23:21] <ThunderRemix8> kissy
[1:23:21] <%the_mental_punk> I think that was a peach stream
[1:23:25] <heartlesshealer> there was a night where you had to switch to "Just Chatting" for a while before game
[1:23:29] <MayorRev> which stream was that
[1:23:31] <%DappercatEsquire> Sounds like a Kojima game
[1:23:32] <%rissaleigh14> That line?
[1:23:34] <%cowardlord> The blightbound stream?
[1:23:39] <%phantomsleeves> when paige used to work overseas, the nights she came back used to take a WHILE
[1:23:42] <transporterthesequel> There have been CANCELED STREAMS because the preroll was the stream
[1:23:43] <DraxTD> I see pat got his big boy bag
[1:23:47] <%weissguard> Looks great.
[1:23:51] <%SirGO0SE> it was pretty good last time tho
[1:23:53] <+NitronStreams> to think some people do streams where they dont actually play a game
[1:23:53] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Dragon Age Origins was the best, and everything after DA2 act 1 was shit. Change my Mind
[1:23:54] <transporterthesequel> It was GREAT, unironically
[1:23:58] <rytisone> to Margueritte
[1:23:58] <FutaSnek> When nobody calls your shitty pun shitty FeelsBadMan
[1:24:00] <+swamp_roo> hi
[1:24:07] <ergulor> Did pat got under the floor already or...?
[1:24:08] <bookofmouths> Blightbound stream was great
[1:24:11] <%SharkMissile> Wasn't it like half an hour of gameplay?
[1:24:17] <heartlesshealer> yeah, but at least the pre-stream is always good
[1:24:21] <%phantomsleeves> that dragon age stream was a pure nightmare
[1:24:22] <@SoFarFetched> yeah it was like half an hour or so of gameplay for blightbound LUL
[1:24:27] <FutaSnek> Yeah that is a good gimmick of these guys
[1:24:29] <%DappercatEsquire> pretty handy, bet you wish you could do that
[1:24:31] <$Afterman_> anyone in chat have any experience with mead? I jsut bought some and am letting it chill before I drink
[1:24:31] <%SharkMissile> They're coming out of the effing walls man
[1:24:33] <%the_mental_punk> I love this game but I just hate the unkisppable cutscenes and opening on replay
[1:24:33] <oniwahoo> Origins was fantastic, it's a shame about DA2
[1:24:38] <FutaSnek> Certain rooms are just spawners
[1:24:38] <+evbites> it only happens twice
[1:24:38] <+Skelex> I love pat's streams, but sometimes I do have to duck in and out with another stream waiting for gameplay to start
[1:24:39] <%rissaleigh14> I love me a good pre stream
[1:24:41] <+Kriptin> Blightbound seemed kinda bad though
[1:24:42] <Pookiedaexzile> One thing I hate about molded is there ability to blend into walls
[1:24:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> I don't think enough fire exists to make this unholy place clean
[1:24:46] <%cowardman93> all the molded need is to be more visually interesting and have more than 3 types
[1:24:47] <%penitentpentwitch> I don't know if it'd be more interesting if the family members constantly patrolled the house or not. More annoying, probably.
[1:24:57] <+evbites> God the molded are so lame
[1:25:07] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I never liked Inquisition. All the characters look oily as fuck, and the hair was atrocious. Barely any waifus either
[1:25:08] <Hydrapissed> hes a diff being
[1:25:09] <%SirGO0SE> prebaked shadows LUL
[1:25:09] <%Garthunox> OH GOD THE GRENADES
[1:25:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Shadows are flat pat
[1:25:12] <KaiserMario> Crouch and check corners in the rooms
[1:25:13] <%DappercatEsquire> shadow wouldn't lie
[1:25:13] <Drusain> REFUND
[1:25:14] <FutaSnek> It's cause the 3rd person animantions arent meant to be viewed'
[1:25:15] <frankavich> Yes you are
[1:25:15] <%SharkMissile> Literally unplayable
[1:25:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Capcom is full of HACK FRAUDS
[1:25:18] <Hydrapissed> he has a stand
[1:25:19] <+aeronauticaljon> umm perspective of light?
[1:25:19] <%the_mental_punk> SHADDOW PUZZLES
[1:25:20] <FutaSnek> So they differ from 1st
[1:25:21] <smuggleruncle> thanks obama
[1:25:21] <MayorRev> no that's fine
[1:25:22] <cosmicgoatee> i mean, they're discount SCP 106
[1:25:23] <%Garthunox> Do you guys remember the grenades?
[1:25:23] <%CrookedSpiral> 0/10 unplayable
[1:25:26] <%cowardman93> PAt do you know how shadows work?
[1:25:29] <%ScottishMadJacko> Have you seen Re7 in third person?
[1:25:31] <+Warnawl> Just get a refund at this point
[1:25:33] <Pookiedaexzile> Shaodws are flat Pat, You are looking at the gun from above the angle changes
[1:25:36] <Hirschensky> uh huh
[1:25:38] <ergulor> Lucas
[1:25:38] <+evbites> lucus
[1:25:38] <Rellim80> Lighting throws off the perspective.
[1:25:38] <KaiserMario> Lucas
[1:25:40] <+twohitgood> 2nd amendment rights
[1:25:41] <%penitentpentwitch> Blame Lucas
[1:25:41] <2017y> the pre stream is a podcast and the gameplay is a skip
[1:25:42] <RaidenRising> they are american
[1:25:45] <+ThomasOfTroy> You don't have one?
[1:25:45] <%the_mental_punk> I love pat streams for pat not for his games
[1:25:49] <Coystick> For launching grenades
[1:25:50] <+lethallunacyx> For the Gators
[1:25:50] <+Kriptin> It's a homemade grenade launcher, the best kind
[1:25:50] <%terraspan> To launch their grenades
[1:25:51] <%SharkMissile> Molded are about 9000% scarier in vr Because they're like 8 feet tall
[1:25:51] <%cowardman93> because people in the boonies get bored and wanna blow stuff up
[1:25:52] <+BrogorkTheFork> Their psycho son built it I would bet.
[1:25:52] <+Mottyrob> is there new content or is this just a refresher playthrough prepping for RE8?
[1:25:53] <%Garthunox> it's for the mosquitos
[1:25:55] <Dova573> Gator fishing
[1:25:55] <%ClutchRoadagain> Do we know why the hillbillies have anything, though?
[1:26:03] <%Tearonex> Answer is always Lucas
[1:26:03] <+Aleate> Imagine not having a grenade launcher
[1:26:04] <+twohitgood> 2nd amendment means they can own whatever insanity they want according to republicans
[1:26:05] <DrkJP520> It's in america, right
[1:26:05] <%rissaleigh14> I bet they have grenades
[1:26:08] <Pookiedaexzile> In America you get Rpgs as birthday gifts
[1:26:11] <transporterthesequel> It’s the DEEP SOUTH Zach, of course they have grenade launchers

Started playing Blasphemous recently and wondered what games has Paige or any of your friends sold you on recently that you didn't originally plan on playing?
[1:26:16] <+lethallunacyx> Also to make cool explosions
[1:26:18] <Pookiedaexzile> Shit I was born wit a glock 19
[1:26:18] <oniwahoo> Is that the part that's odd? Not the mutated mold monsters of the abductions or secret underground lab? the grenade launcher is where it gets weird?

[1:27:03] <oniwahoo> @garbagequeenellie I can't tell if this is the set up to a joke or a legit question lol
[1:27:03] <+PatchworkSquid> @garbagequeenellie hillbilly was originally a slur against the Irish. white trash is self explanatory.
[1:27:03] <Daxalog> oh no
[1:27:06] <Pookiedaexzile> White Trash can be from anywhere, Hill Billies are from the Appalachian Hills

[1:27:37] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @oniwahoo I mean, do the bakers owning a trailer make them white trash, or just hillbilly?
[1:27:45] <cosmicgoatee> don't lose your day job Pat
[1:27:52] <%Ixiah> why do u have the rocketlauncher ? what if you need it later ????
[1:28:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> Hillbillies are 50% more likely to be creepy killers than white trash

[1:28:45] <oniwahoo> Yeah, I think that's about right, Squid
[1:28:48] <%ClutchRoadagain> @GarbageQueenEllie I think really depends on the Baker in question, they're kind of like a political compass if you think about it.
[1:28:50] <%GarbageQueenEllie> @PatchworkSquid that makes sense. And at least pre-mold, they seemed fairly wealthy
[1:28:51] <KaiserMario> You're welcome...
[1:28:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> The orb is now erect
[1:29:11] <indig0bird> Pat, do you prefer automatic sort or a sort button?

[1:31:33] <%GarbageQueenEllie> I bet the mold in this game smells the worst. Just the worst
[1:31:36] <+OwlLightningMage> DID PAT JUST SAY HE HAS TOO MANY ITEMS
[1:31:40] <+tutsabutz> psaBlep psaBlep psaWink psaWink

[1:31:43] <Aydarkzero> always bring the Knife!
[1:31:46] <+evbites> why
[1:31:51] <oniwahoo> really?
[1:31:54] <PanicSwytch> The mind goblins are hording the items
[1:31:54] <%Keyd00d> @fairore Yeah that's definitely a big part
[1:32:28] <%twoto858> Shit's locked
[1:32:28] <+Walopoh> every square inch of this property would smell awful. It's already a swamp before this wacky bullshit LUL @GarbageQueenEllie
[1:32:32] <rytisone> now Ethan will become spiderman
[1:32:35] <%0nl00kr> this fight can burn through ammo though
[1:32:35] <%cowardlord> Knife only run
[1:32:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Pat, there's a single uneven pixel in your Atache case!!
[1:32:48] <+evbites> Pat would die super hard in re
[1:32:50] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[1:32:51] <+BrogorkTheFork> Pat has a case of the vapors
[1:32:53] <%ScottishMadJacko> Get rid of the blue fluid, its useless imo
[1:33:00] <%Aleate> Shits locked and everything is dirty

[1:34:31] <0rond> why no face cam today?
[1:34:34] <+Walopoh> @trllly RE8 is coming soon. and also because it has been a few years
[1:34:47] <ha2ken> Hope he can get a good shot of her crawling up the wall
[1:34:47] <%FutaSnek> I wonder why the infection effected her like this... like Jack just becomes a werid mold guy and so does lucas
[1:34:49] <Ultimatefool> Fuck it, we'll make our own P.T.
[1:34:49] <+aeronauticaljon> I hope she screems "I AM COVERED IN BEES" mgs3 reference LUL
[1:34:50] <+Kriptin> God those things are more terrifying than her.
[1:34:53] <%FutaSnek> Her form is so diffrent
[1:34:56] <%terraspan> Thorb is out
[1:34:56] <%Keyd00d> This is still part of the RE marathon from last year
[1:34:59] <%AncelDeLambert> this is such a different game when you've run through it once and know what you're doing
[1:35:03] <+Walopoh> Jack's design can NOT be improved upon
[1:35:03] <%trllly> @Walopoh Ah,cool.
[1:35:07] <trianglehat> rocket lawn chair
[1:35:09] <Coystick> She might be the most disturbing design in all of RE.
[1:35:10] <+SenorCounter> Rocket Lawn Chair

[1:35:48] <+PatchworkSquid> @anceldelambert so just like every other RE. the way it should be.
[1:35:49] <+lethallunacyx> Because of the pepperonis?
[1:35:52] <Pookiedaexzile> Her whole Grundle is fucked
[1:35:53] <oniwahoo> Pat doesn't want Me. Twitch to see his sausages
[1:35:54] <%FutaSnek> @evbites But Zoe doesn't turn into one of these things its just sorta confusing

[1:36:04] <pomki20> what made pat go back to re7?
[1:36:05] <Coystick> Over-under double barrel is neat
[1:36:09] <%AncelDeLambert> nah, I still get anxious playing parts of RE4
[1:36:09] <oniwahoo> Mr. Twitch* damnit
[1:36:09] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat tities = Pepperoni's
[1:36:09] <+Walopoh> SQUORK
[1:36:17] <%the_mental_punk> what do you mean ruined?
[1:36:21] <%Keyd00d> Not just the grundle my friend
[1:36:21] <@SoFarFetched> @pomki20 still continuing his RE marathon
[1:36:22] <%trllly> psaGief psaBlep
[1:36:25] <heartlesshealer> oh no did Paige give him attention during tantrum?
[1:36:25] <%ScottishMadJacko> @FutaSnek Remember she turns into an anime lady though
[1:36:26] <%NovaKnightmare> @pomki20 Pat's been doing an off an on RE marathon
[1:36:28] <KaiserMario> She does call them her "babies"
[1:36:32] <+lethallunacyx> Excuse me?
[1:36:40] <Pookiedaexzile> NO DONT SIT ON MY FACE
[1:36:43] <pomki20> oh nice
[1:36:44] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL for a second I thought she'd one-shotted you
[1:36:44] <+Pugweight> this better shotgun is better
[1:36:45] <+evbites> @FutaSnek evie didn't like zoe and she becomes an anime princess in joe's dlc
[1:36:46] <+Remery_> No upskirt pls god
[1:36:46] <%mikessdd> Why'd she bite me?!
[1:36:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Not with that grundle
[1:36:49] <+Walopoh> *backs off for no reason* LUL
[1:36:50] <%penitentpentwitch> It's weird she lets you up rather than you pushing her off
[1:36:51] <%vibe__lord> She has a WAP, WASPY ASS PUSSY
[1:36:56] <+lordericter> eww she bit your carotid
[1:36:58] <Coystick> M'aam it's called a "Brazilian" IF YOU PLEASE
[1:37:01] <%terraspan> unfortunate
[1:37:03] <+aeronauticaljon> too many juices :(
[1:37:03] <%kelkellington> she certainly has a WAP
[1:37:05] <oniwahoo> Please Margaret put on some clothes
[1:37:10] <+Remery_> The only upskirt i dont want to see
[1:37:11] <TurtlesAndTentacles> HER VAGINA IS A NEST?!
[1:37:18] <%Keyd00d> wasp-ass pussy
[1:37:20] <+evbites> yup
[1:37:32] <Coystick> The only upskirt I wish Sony would censor
[1:37:34] <%vibe__lord> Waspy ass pussy
[1:37:39] <+lethallunacyx> Gives a whole new meaning to wap
[1:37:40] <%NovaKnightmare> Man After knowing whats the deal with the bakers, its fucked up this nice mom got into this thing
[1:37:41] <Pookiedaexzile> Warped ass Pussy
[1:37:44] <krabthecrab> Eh... beggars can't be choosers
[1:37:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> Whyd we get to see this and not lady
[1:37:57] <+evbites> this was fine but hot tna is bad?
[1:38:05] <KaiserMario> Eat herbs
[1:38:06] <+Remery_> They would have been called cowards if they censored the wasp/spider/bee nest vagina
[1:38:06] <KatyBee> Hurry, eat bug
[1:38:07] <%FutaSnek> She reminds me of a dead space enemy
[1:38:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> Cmon capcom
[1:38:10] <heartlesshealer> no more juice for Ethan
[1:38:10] <%FutaSnek> In a good way
[1:38:19] <%ScottishMadJacko> Eat plain herbs
[1:38:26] <+aeronauticaljon> @NovaKnightmare Blame umberella for their bullshit
[1:38:26] <LorcaNomad> out of heals monkaS
[1:38:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> Or find some chem fluid chilling around
[1:38:32] <%stabbityrabbit> So how ready is Pat for Chris to fucking merc Mia?
[1:38:33] <+Pugweight> waspy ass p word
[1:38:35] <%CrookedSpiral> LUL
[1:38:46] <oniwahoo> I see Pat's brain is less melted than last time
[1:38:50] <%Keyd00d> oh god death
[1:38:53] <%FutaSnek> Oh cool unique line for healing
[1:38:55] <%vibe__lord> Margaret got a thick WAP
[1:38:59] <%FutaSnek> Never saw that
[1:38:59] <0rond> @FutaSnek nah jack didn't become a weird mold guy, he basically became indestructible and he looked like he did because of his body repairing itself hardier and hardier, maybe because in eveline's mind he is the strong father that protects them, marg, as the mother, had her womb replaced with a hive so she basically gives birth to bugs. lucas is the only one that is basically an upgraded molded because I don't think she cared much about him, which is why he is also not really affected mentally i
[1:39:00] <Coystick> I need to ask my wife who is a doctor if p words can get that waspy
[1:39:00] <%penitentpentwitch> She just lets you up, tis odd
[1:39:06] <%Paralurx> "Don't much care for that"
[1:39:06] <Pookiedaexzile> "P Word"
[1:39:06] <lyzejag> Geez Mom
[1:39:07] <Talfri> nice
[1:39:09] <rytisone> she said face off
[1:39:14] <%FutaSnek> AAAAAAND DED
[1:39:17] <LorcaNomad> pop
[1:39:17] <KaiserMario> GG
[1:39:21] <+SenorCounter> She'll be alright
[1:39:22] <Coystick> Great death animation
[1:39:24] <%Keyd00d> BLRBLBLRLBR
[1:39:26] <%NovaKnightmare> fuckin Thanos'd her
[1:39:27] <heartlesshealer> dry ass p-word now
[1:39:27] <+NitronStreams> why did the mold make her a bug lady again?
[1:39:28] <Aydarkzero> nice
[1:39:29] <+lethallunacyx> She no longer has a wap
[1:39:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Jesus Pat
[1:39:37] <+Soliloquy123> So why does Marge stay dead but Jack doesn't?
[1:39:38] <%penitentpentwitch> Time to raid the corners for loot
[1:39:43] <%vibe__lord> Where was she hiding the lantern?
[1:39:46] <%cowardman93> did she... eat? the lantern?
[1:39:47] <%asgard147> GG Pat
[1:39:47] <%Keyd00d> When she died she turned into Knack
[1:39:47] <+MushyCornbread> where was she hiding that?
[1:39:49] <LorcaNomad> so what's different with this version of RE7?
[1:39:55] <Coystick> @NitronStreams because her residence was evil
[1:40:00] <illtima> Jack had to be killed like 3 times to stay dead
[1:40:02] <Talfri> @NitronStreams I think mold generally affects people differently if turned into Molded
[1:40:04] <$Caped_Eggy> I always find it strange how sassy Ethan is despite the situation he's in
[1:40:05] <%FutaSnek> @0rond In his final boss phase he clearly becomes a weird mold guy idk what you mean
[1:40:07] <rytisone> time for drugs
[1:40:08] <%Skelegroove> Jack slowly killed himself over time to build up a tolerance
[1:40:09] <%cowardman93> Marguerite is the 18+ version of bugsnax
[1:40:13] <Pookiedaexzile> "All she seems to be talking about in this song is how many Wasp she can fit in her P-Word, how is this even msuic"
[1:40:14] <The_Pasta_Paladin> @Soliloquy123 That's actually a really good point I didn't consider before
[1:40:16] <Talfri> @NitronStreams *if NOT turned into Molded
[1:40:17] <heartlesshealer> Ethan has the nest-womb lantern now
[1:40:21] <oniwahoo> Yeah, Ethan is real suspicious
[1:40:24] <+OwlLightningMage> Jack needed many kills
[1:40:28] <%Loinclothiclese> I'm excited for 8 cause i loved 7's story but i hated the molded they were just really boring enemies to me and made me skip playing the game itself instead of watching its story.
[1:40:32] <Jack_DT> biohazard
[1:40:53] <%Loinclothiclese> instead i watched it i mean.
[1:40:56] <%RoggleJr> Couch.
[1:41:02] <+evbites> @Loinclothiclese they needed human features and gore
[1:41:05] <%ScottishMadJacko> Aye, the molded were cool but they shouldve been an enemy type, not the only enemies except fro bosses
[1:41:08] <+NitronStreams> Ethan needs his drugs
[1:41:20] <%FutaSnek> I wonder if 8 is just zombie werewolves
[1:41:24] <%FutaSnek> that would be FUCKING SICK
[1:41:31] <+evbites> and some headcrab styled screaming help me or let me die
[1:41:32] <%FutaSnek> Or beastmen
[1:41:33] <%penitentpentwitch> The herbs are usually the oddball ones to find
[1:41:35] <%FutaSnek> of ome kind
[1:41:35] <%Loinclothiclese> @evbites i would have really liked either zombos of some kind or mutant monsters not black bland looking things
[1:41:45] <The_Pasta_Paladin> The molded were fine as an enemy type but definitely needed a larger variety. Just my opinion though
[1:41:56] <+evbites> well were getting it now
[1:42:03] <%mikessdd> Yeah seemed like spending so much time working on each of the family left us with the milquetoast that is the molded
[1:42:07] <0rond> @FutaSnek he lost his entire upper half in the penultimate battle, so his body grew aggressively. I think you can actually see his face on the last form if you look closely iirc
[1:42:07] <%Loinclothiclese> @FutaSnek no, you must have missed the article from people that played tests of the games you fight villagers too
[1:42:07] <@commanderclaw> They're visually bland too
[1:42:08] <SirKeigan> Yea, just visually needed a change
[1:42:11] <rytisone> and bees
[1:42:11] <%cowardman93> normal, crawly and FAT
[1:42:12] <Aydarkzero> Normal, Scythe, Doggo Mode
[1:42:15] <%ScottishMadJacko> There were like 4, if you include the special armed molded
[1:42:15] <heartlesshealer> made too much juice, no space
[1:42:18] <%Skelegroove> No real reason the molded had to be humanoid shapes
[1:42:18] <+evbites> and in not a hero they're white
[1:42:18] <SirKeigan> Visually they need more color and style
[1:42:19] <%SirGO0SE> they already remind me of the revelatons zombos
[1:42:22] <ergulor> and big
[1:42:24] <SpookyBeef7> Three types and they all look largely the same.
[1:42:24] <RaidenRising> THE FAT ONE
[1:42:25] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL
[1:42:27] <RaidenRising> FAT ASSES
[1:42:28] <Aydarkzero> oh Fat Mold forgot about that one
[1:42:30] <%penitentpentwitch> Need like 'crab molded' 'tentacle molded' 'Not a Birkin-ripoff molded'
[1:42:31] <%Loinclothiclese> @mikessdd yea 100% my thoughts that and mia being lame
[1:42:33] <SirKeigan> Yea they could've been orbs
[1:42:50] <%stabbityrabbit> I hope 8 still has molded, just in addition to a bunch of other stuff. Zombies, werewolves, Chris Redfield trying to set you up on a blind date. Standard RE stuff.
[1:42:50] <Talfri> could have had Molded alligators in the main game
[1:42:52] <+aeronauticaljon> Unless they were the crew of the ship
[1:42:54] <SirKeigan> bong
[1:43:00] <+Remery_> being human just made them easier to bang
[1:43:04] <%miabyte> Hey kiddos.
[1:43:04] <+xeros720> with how they come out of walls, they could be anything
[1:43:08] <%M4T1A5> burner fuel
[1:43:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> There was fatty, off brand lickers, regular ones, and the variants of the regualr ones with the arms
[1:43:12] <%FutaSnek> @Loinclothiclese Ahhh so their going the re4 route again,
[1:43:13] <Coystick> The molded are 6/10 creature designs at best, nothing on regular zombies
[1:43:17] <+evbites> i argue they wen't human enough you need to see mangled faces of pain and terror
[1:43:21] <Pookiedaexzile> why no big tiddie molded gf
[1:43:21] <rytisone> there was supposed to be a molded dog in early concept
[1:43:22] <oniwahoo> Welcome to the stream, Mia
[1:43:26] <+xeros720> oh, you know how the cop is half molded later? maybe that was the original intent
[1:43:27] <+sp_abadidea> imagine a limbless serpentine molded that just slithers across the floor to get to you. OOUGH
[1:43:33] <%Aleate> Thats not a knoif... THIS is a KNOIF
[1:43:38] <0rond> they are humanoid so that the player base will have an easier time to feel horny towards them
[1:43:38] <%rumtumtugnutz> Did that say 'charm fluid'?
[1:43:39] <SirKeigan> Draw-er?
[1:43:43] <2017y> arent the molded like
[1:43:48] <2017y> humans under mind control
[1:43:49] <+evbites> it ain't body horror if there no way to tell it's flesh
[1:43:49] <%penitentpentwitch> Licker Molded!
[1:43:51] <Coystick> More bug horror like Margy would've been way better
[1:43:52] <2017y> thats why theyre human shaped
[1:43:55] <Saltmeisterr> is pat out of the bee zone?
[1:43:56] <%rumtumtugnutz> DRAW
[1:43:56] <2017y> because theyre humans
[1:44:01] <SirKeigan> Licker Molded would have been good
[1:44:03] <%Loinclothiclese> @SirGO0SE eh not really rev monsters were way kooler in 1 and 2 but all 7 has was bland looking molded for every type
[1:44:05] <heartlesshealer> yeah, they're in that inbetween area of not human enough but also too humanoid to be exciting
[1:44:07] <Nickdick96> spider-filled molded that would pour spiders out if you headshot them
[1:44:08] <+evbites> yup but still not good
[1:44:11] <2017y> @saltmeisterr y
[1:44:15] <SirKeigan> Molded Mr. X maybe?
[1:44:18] <%FutaSnek> The molded are "scary" but they arent "disturbing" to look at
[1:44:19] <Saltmeisterr> pls tell me pat is out of the be zone
[1:44:23] <Coystick> Licker Molded are basically those quick ones on all fours
[1:44:31] <+xeros720> i don't even mind the molded that much, but the stronger versions could be more unique
[1:44:36] <+evbites> the human body is a host then the mold spreads and bursts out
[1:44:37] <%ScottishMadJacko> The molded come from people but still no reason to remain human shaped
[1:44:48] <penitentpentwitch> You sound less tired
[1:44:54] <Codofwisdom> I thought the reason the Molded were humanoid was because of Eveline wanting a family? I'm probably wrong.
[1:44:58] <%mikessdd> This game looks so good. I have it on pc as well
[1:44:59] <%Loinclothiclese> @2017y no... eve just made them they arent people
[1:45:01] <%FutaSnek> RE7 is a good revival after 6
[1:45:05] <%FutaSnek> it did its job
[1:45:05] <+aeronauticaljon> Dude I want the regenerator from RE4 to come back.
[1:45:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> I hope Re8 is fantastic
[1:45:10] <%marsantas> They had ideas, some worked
[1:45:14] <+xeros720> capcom loves their test shit
[1:45:16] <Nickdick96> Orks should come out of the mold
[1:45:16] <%GarbageQueenEllie> We love you Mustard Wahmen!
[1:45:18] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pat has energy
[1:45:21] <%the_mental_punk> the molded are human becuase thats probably the only body rig they made
[1:45:22] <benjiFG> thank you paige
[1:45:24] <+Memnarch7> WE LOVE PAIGE
[1:45:25] <@commanderclaw> RE7 after 6 was like going from a shit sandwich to a nice reuben
[1:45:25] <%NovaKnightmare> Praise the Mold Queen raising the Dog Scion
[1:45:28] <0rond> she is sitting next to you fanning you wiht a giant fan
[1:45:28] <%medusasghost> we love you paige thanks for being awesome

[1:45:39] <+evbites> i hate re's fleshy eyeless enemies it's just so lame
[1:45:39] <%Loinclothiclese> @the_mental_punk They arent.
[1:45:41] <%GeneralSCPatton> Do you think the devs will ever do anything interesting with Prions? They are so damn durable they can survive an autoclave, and should be incurable unless you make a bioweapon that eats it without eating your brain.
[1:45:45] <%Aleate> Thank to the Mustard Monarch
[1:45:48] <%Paralurx> "Paige sucking my life essence is what keeps me going" Pat, paraphrased
[1:45:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Nah dump ass all over his chat
[1:45:49] <%weissguard> Kappa
[1:45:50] <%asgard147> awwww limesAw

[1:45:56] <xXjuffelXx> cute
[1:45:56] <%medusasghost> well there goes my allotted affection pat you wasted it
[1:45:58] <rytisone> watch out for gator
[1:45:58] <+xeros720> HE WAS BEING NICE
[1:45:59] <%mikessdd> Pat loves paige so much its great
[1:45:59] <RaidenRising> baka
[1:46:01] <%cowardman93> PRECIOUS ANTIQUE COIN
[1:46:01] <LordOfThePoultry> wow LUL
[1:46:02] <%phantomsleeves> feels nice to get mushy about your partner sometimes
[1:46:04] <bookofmouths> ma precious antique coin
[1:46:05] <%GarbageQueenEllie> We're gonna Hydrogen Bomb Paige with our appreciation, there's not a damn thing you'll be able to do about it.
[1:46:11] <%asgard147> He said he LOVES YOU limesAw
[1:46:13] <xXjuffelXx> LUL
[1:46:13] <+SH1NK1R0> The molded aren’t humans under mind control. They are mass of fungal fluid from the main host that she controls remotely like the marker controls necromorphs in dead space. People can be infected and turned in to molded but that process is basically liquefying them for their parts. There’s no reason they stay human shaped at all
[1:46:16] <+MushyCornbread> rich now
[1:46:24] <%cowardman93> I wish more of the game was like this area
[1:46:26] <%FutaSnek> Plus this game totally took after PT and the MASSIVE popularity boom from it and its eventual cancellation. Like I bet a 3rd person verion of this game exists but they saw how good PT did and went huh 1st person
[1:46:40] <+xeros720> anything heavily scripted has this issue
[1:46:50] <%Loinclothiclese> The molded are so fucking lame
[1:46:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like remember mia at the beginning
[1:46:58] <%ScottishMadJacko> She was a spooky bitch
[1:46:58] <%cowardman93> I really hoped for a molded gator in this game and nothing
[1:46:59] <+evbites> oh no a black shape
[1:47:01] <%penitentpentwitch> Reminds me of FEAR, the almost audible difference between 'combat zones' and 'horror zones'
[1:47:04] <%marsantas> The lack of enemy verity IS a problem
[1:47:07] <%bluescreen1988> molded hold this game back honestly
[1:47:08] <Codofwisdom> See, that "My family" drawing feels like the justification for the Molded being humanoid. It's lazy, but *shrug*
[1:47:10] <%Skelegroove> Molded could have been bunny or teddy bear shaped
[1:47:11] <%the_mental_punk> I think the engine for this game is what took up most of the attention when making it
[1:47:13] <oniwahoo> @sh1nk1r0 Even if they were it's a swamp, there's a variety of animal types that could easily be justified as well
[1:47:14] <Pookiedaexzile> We need them to buss open the Monster box and throw us some fancy shit
[1:47:15] <+Mkingston> pregnant spider lady
[1:47:19] <2017y> @cowardman93 in the dlc
[1:47:19] <0rond> @PatStaresAt isn't each baker significantly deeper than say RE4 bosses
[1:47:24] <%M4T1A5> there could be 2 molded
[1:47:25] <%SharkMissile> I think they're scary ;_;
[1:47:27] <+aeronauticaljon> @penitentpentwitch Such a good game
[1:47:27] <%Keyd00d> RE8 has potential for cool new types
[1:47:28] <DrkJP520> Well, u didn't know that the first time thru
[1:47:28] <+evbites> they need to be grosser like marg
[1:47:32] <%GarbageNirvana> it's more like oh no you didn't wash the dishes
[1:47:32] <+michingmallecho> It was a new engine and I feel like they didn’t want to over commit to different types but RE8 though...😧
[1:47:32] <%Loinclothiclese> @bluescreen1988 They are straight up the reason i watched the story instead of playing the game
[1:47:33] <%FutaSnek> The molded in the Demo was the scariest one ironically because you didnt know shit about it LUL
[1:47:48] <%GarbageQueenEllie> We need more Saison Marguerite
[1:47:49] <+evbites> shut up ghost
[1:47:50] <%SirGO0SE> somethings got to give
[1:47:52] <$raziel391> Are you gonna play Not A Zoe?
[1:47:54] <%cowardman93> @2017y I forgot about that so hard
[1:47:54] <Pookiedaexzile> I can't wait for the new WAP, Werewolfs and Priest
[1:47:56] <%FutaSnek> I think Evie is terrible but thats just me
[1:48:06] <%bluescreen1988> @Loinclothiclese same
[1:48:07] <+The_Protagonist> thepro95Emil thepro95Emil thepro95Emil
[1:48:09] <0rond> bitch ass ghosts
[1:48:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> She might be the best example of a monster matriarch
[1:48:09] <+evbites> so does woolie
[1:48:14] <%cowardman93> Piss off ghost!
[1:48:18] <%GarbageNirvana> you know what was creepy was the regenerators
[1:48:20] <+Mkingston> robbot2DarkRoom
[1:48:23] <%FutaSnek> I think the little girl bio-weapon thing is the stupidest thing ever but hey thats just my opinion
[1:48:24] <Pookiedaexzile> It also works, Ghost are shy
[1:48:25] <2017y> AAA games always get watered down
[1:48:26] <Piemen99> Piemen99 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 25 months! 
[1:48:28] <+evbites> who built this
[1:48:31] <+Soliloquy123> Being aggressively rude to supernatural bullshit helps me power through horror games, tbh
[1:48:31] <%GarbageNirvana> bring those back
[1:48:35] <+xeros720> he gains power by telling ghosts that they are a bitch
[1:48:38] <%DappercatEsquire> toink
[1:48:40] <%FutaSnek> LUCAS BUILT THIS
[1:48:48] <+Remery_> still gooey
[1:48:48] <Pookiedaexzile> BOO
[1:48:53] <bookofmouths> drink the arm goo
[1:48:55] <rytisone> behind you
[1:48:57] <+OK__Gamer> can't say I understand where this other evie cones from
[1:49:00] <%asgard147> monkaS
[1:49:01] <Guardiansaiyan> sup
[1:49:05] <%FutaSnek> LUCAS built every piece of tech that makes you go " who the fuck makes this"
[1:49:07] <2017y> i bet theres a spec sheet for an re7 where you slowly got infected over the course of the game from exposure to: the mold
[1:49:09] <+evbites> ahhhhhh
[1:49:14] <+xeros720> in retrospect with how important that hand is, he really should've grabbed more of the arm
[1:49:18] <+aeronauticaljon> DUDE that got me
[1:49:30] <0rond> there is no other evie, it's just an hallucination
[1:49:32] <jestrfestr> tf is this FOV?
[1:49:35] <Coystick> They have muppet heads
[1:49:36] <oniwahoo> RE7: Lucas did it, don't worry about it
[1:49:39] <%Piemen99> psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab psaDab
[1:49:41] <%penitentpentwitch> If molded were 'destructible' like Necromorphs but regenerated body parts would make them more intimidating
[1:49:43] <%ScottishMadJacko> Is running
[1:49:45] <%miabyte> naisu
[1:49:49] <%FutaSnek> There's a computer engineering trophy in lucas's room
[1:49:49] <+Mkingston> saving ammo lol
[1:49:50] <sweetpotatokingwow> cant believe how freeeakin good this game looks manm
[1:49:57] <+xeros720> i wish i knew which phone calls to skip
[1:49:57] <%FutaSnek> Implying hes sorta a super genius
[1:49:57] <rytisone> but that only works on replays
[1:49:59] <0rond> at this point evie is the grandma, any evie that looks like evie is an illusion
[1:50:02] <%FutaSnek> but still a asshole
[1:50:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Just let the basement fill up with Zombos its cool
[1:50:08] <+evbites> hi best girl
[1:50:09] <CapOfAllFools> MOSHI MOSHI
[1:50:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yeah, making moldy hald regenerators couldve been interesting
[1:50:26] <%ScottishMadJacko> have*
[1:50:26] <%penitentpentwitch> Also, how does she know which phones to call?
[1:50:29] <Coystick> Hi Zoe send feet pics
[1:50:33] <%miabyte> what was the dlc like for this game?
[1:50:33] <%Loinclothiclese> @penitentpentwitch eh they still look lame no mechanic can make me deal with how boring they are
[1:50:42] <%M4T1A5> the thing is in the phone room
[1:50:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> DLC was great
[1:50:47] <%FutaSnek> Just like... why would you make a bio weapon that has its own will and can WORK AGAINST YOU
[1:50:51] <0rond> it's weird that zoe calls you and not ethan calling zoe
[1:50:51] <%ClericOfSparda> Honestly I still feel cheated on who you have to pick for the good ending
[1:50:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> Especialy Joes dlc
[1:50:53] <Guardiansaiyan> @miabyte Joe Baker WWE
[1:50:55] <%FutaSnek> That just seems really short sighted
[1:50:55] <Pookiedaexzile> You ever get bopped off by a southern girl after shooting her mom in her Wasp pussy
[1:51:03] <%Loinclothiclese> @miabyte the chris and joe baker ones are awesome thats about it
[1:51:05] <+NitronStreams> LOOK AT IT
[1:51:05] <%penitentpentwitch> @Loinclothiclese Visually uninteresting to be certain
[1:51:06] <+SH1NK1R0> Nah for me ammo saving was largely done by just not shooting at most enemies more than the 2 shots it took to knock them down. If they needed to die then they got knifed if they didn’t I would just run
[1:51:15] <+NitronStreams> LOOK AT THE MONEY
[1:51:18] <+evbites> @ClericOfSparda But zoe gave us joe baker
[1:51:21] <%the_mental_punk> plus PsVr that was probably a push by sony
[1:51:22] <%Aleate> Also VR
[1:51:24] <+SlappyMeats> and of course to indulge the hell out of VR
[1:51:24] <@commanderclaw> Playstation also probably gave them dosh for VR
[1:51:26] <rytisone> that's why I was surprised dmc5 used this engine
[1:51:27] <%GeneralSCPatton> So, the hand was needed for the serum, but you could grab more. Were there any other ingredients that were actually limited?
[1:51:28] <Aydarkzero> i love the fps experience for resident evil 7
[1:51:29] <Codofwisdom> It was also probably so they could VR it, yeah.
[1:51:33] <+NitronStreams> ZOEH
[1:51:39] <0rond> really? there is something really off in RE engine's faces to me, especially when they are like wincing, it just seems like forceful acting, both in this game and in DMC5
[1:51:53] <%NovaKnightmare> Fuck u Lucas
[1:51:53] <+NitronStreams> Where you at dog?
[1:51:55] <+evbites> This fucking guy
[1:51:59] <%FutaSnek> Its the CGI conversion drugs
[1:52:02] <%AzureGale> Oh no
[1:52:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Zoey: Ada but Swampy
[1:52:09] <0rond> probably
[1:52:16] <%ScottishMadJacko> I fucking hate lucas
[1:52:16] <+Kduff89> emongS
[1:52:18] <benjiFG> so no head?
[1:52:22] <%Loinclothiclese> @0rond eh imo just mia was ugly as hell
[1:52:32] <+doc_ock_rokc> zangief
[1:52:36] <Guardiansaiyan> yup
[1:52:38] <Aydarkzero> he is
[1:52:41] <Pookiedaexzile> This voice actor is having so much fun
[1:52:42] <%miabyte> this is the Saw ripoff bit right? LUL
[1:52:42] <%penitentpentwitch> He's a good Heel
[1:52:47] <%FutaSnek> He's the best "asshole" character RE has ever had
[1:52:48] <SchroedingersFerret> He is the best worst
[1:52:49] <%AzureGale> Lucas is an inferior Ness
[1:52:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Lucas is such a shit. He's a great villain
[1:52:49] <%Skelegroove> Think Lucas is gonna show up in RE8?
[1:52:49] <+deedubbelyuu> such the worst
[1:52:50] <+doc_ock_rokc> He isn't even mold crazy
[1:52:52] <TurtlesAndTentacles> its great to see him die
[1:52:56] <RaidenRising> top tier heel
[1:52:57] <0rond> nah, in DMC5 when dante winces it just seems weirdly off, evie looks like it a bit too
[1:52:59] <+durthknight> lucas is 11/10
[1:52:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like his family were so great and hes just a piece of shit
[1:53:01] <%GeneralSCPatton> The fact that this is just regular crazy seals it
[1:53:02] <+evbites> he is the worst is villains who think they're cool but are just stupid
[1:53:03] <SmolBluGhost> he's the best kind of worst
[1:53:04] <%FutaSnek> WAAAY better then the guy in 6 who becomes a WHALE
[1:53:04] <+Soliloquy123> He's the best at being the worst
[1:53:07] <$Vineslop_Tod> Too bad his DLC is so boring
[1:53:19] <%NovaKnightmare> Hes like Psuedo Moldy
[1:53:20] <zeif00> All the Bakers are fun
[1:53:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> He was always evil
[1:53:22] <Aydarkzero> he just embraced it
[1:53:24] <+evbites> he killed a kid at like 7
[1:53:24] <+Remery_> No one ever expects Lucas
[1:53:25] <%g0atmeal> He was evil as a kid
[1:53:28] <%weissguard> Something ain't right about that boy.
[1:53:30] <Guardiansaiyan> booooooo
[1:53:30] <+StrawberryPantsu> Booooo
[1:53:32] <%g0atmeal> He killed a classmate didn't he?
[1:53:32] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, so he does what Wesker can't in a CAVE?! WITH A BOX OF SCRAPS?!
[1:53:32] <%stabbityrabbit> I really hope he becomes a proper boss fight in RE8, or that he just appears in that game in general.
[1:53:33] <Guardiansaiyan> lol
[1:53:33] <cosmicgoatee> Lucas is an ICP fan, he needs to suffer
[1:53:34] <cephas97> no pat
[1:53:34] <Pookiedaexzile> So he was A House Bad
[1:53:34] <%FutaSnek> His DLC felt like they wernt given enough time
[1:53:35] <+doc_ock_rokc> So he was the resident evil?
[1:53:35] <+Sargon1stClass> Lucas is the new shitlord Wesker
[1:53:36] <+StrawberryPantsu> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[1:53:37] <SchroedingersFerret> He's a legit psychopath
[1:53:38] <+Skelex> He already killed another kid when he was younger
[1:53:38] <%DappercatEsquire> i don't understand
[1:53:39] <TurtlesAndTentacles> A...RESIDENT EVIL
[1:53:40] <%asgard147> boo
[1:53:41] <%stabbityrabbit> He was just too good of a villain.
[1:53:43] <+michingmallecho> So he’s the hillbilly Wesker
[1:53:44] <%miabyte> hmmm so you're saying the real Evil were the Residents we met along the way
[1:53:44] <%NDHCemployee> Boooooooooooo
[1:53:44] <SmolBluGhost> already at? Jeez that's some EVIL

[1:54:29] <0rond> yeah it's hard to say no when the biohazard is an abandoned little girl
[1:54:32] <indig0bird> "Kill yourself"
[1:54:34] <Codofwisdom> More than enough to kill anything that moves.
[1:54:35] <%DappercatEsquire> Lucas is just Pat but a bio monster instead of a toilet, and not an orb
[1:54:41] <+doc_ock_rokc> baby dog

[1:54:45] <Guardiansaiyan> WE CAN'T HEAR YOU PAT
[1:54:46] <SmolBluGhost> baby foods
[1:54:46] <SirKeigan> Has this stream been more dog stuff than game stuff?
[1:54:55] <Guardiansaiyan> is not confident about Pat feeding the BABY 2.0
[1:54:57] <%Loinclothiclese> @DappercatEsquire sounds the same to me Kappa
[1:55:01] <%FutaSnek> What if a RE villian injected themselves with their virus but it just gave them massive balls?
[1:55:01] <rytisone> but your wr record time, Pat

[2:02:31] <heartlesshealer> You have to teach dog the "WAIT" command by obviously taking the food away to a high place when dog rushes the bowl. Attempt again after a few minutes and repeat until he stays away long enough for the bowl to be filled. For effectiveness combine command with a raised finger gesture
[2:02:33] <tanarath> he is, though.
[2:02:39] <%ragingbrachy> yeah i know

[2:06:06] <Pookiedaexzile> How Did Pat find a dog that was just him
[2:06:24] <%ragingbrachy> are we done here?
[2:06:28] <rytisone> except for a photo
[2:06:34] <%FutaSnek> @heartlesshealer Thats oddly specific like china and skeletons
[2:06:36] <heartlesshealer> just nudge the mold up the stairs
[2:06:40] <%Loinclothiclese> @doc_ock_rokc joe baker would have been a better protagonist
[2:06:43] <DrkJP520> I hate blood vignetting. Get that shit out of my games. Looks terrible
[2:06:49] <+OwlLightningMage> Dog is food Vergil with the YUMatto
[2:06:49] <+StingtheKing> Durable.
[2:06:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> Get Stick molded
[2:06:53] <%jjolion> I forgot if there was dog mold enemies
[2:06:53] <$Afterman_> oh god, do those spore monsters use the fucking licker skeletons? or rather do the lickers in re2 use those spore skeletons?
[2:06:58] <+aeronauticaljon> literaly pushing the enemy up the stairs lol
[2:07:06] <Pookiedaexzile> What you don't know Strawberry Jelly
[2:07:07] <%cowardlord> Shooting them sounds so wet
[2:07:08] <+Regigangster> same
[2:07:12] <%Loinclothiclese> @DrkJP520 All that shit does is ruin your vision theres zero point to it.
[2:07:19] <%terraspan> Make's it feel like you're wearing a fishbowl
[2:07:20] <%ragingbrachy> your eyes dont get caked in blood when you get shot in the arm?
[2:07:21] <%CoreyOfMyLife> The blood vignetting was the worst in COD where it looked like Strawberry jam
[2:07:26] <heartlesshealer> @FutaSnek Sometimes crimes happened in places and then blanket bans on corpse depiction as opposed to violence depiction happens
[2:07:28] <DrkJP520> Me too
[2:07:29] <+StrawberryPantsu> But how will you know when you have low health Kappa
[2:07:36] <%GeneralSCPatton> @drkjp520 Do you not cry bloody tears when you stub your toe and then schlorp them back in after a minute?
[2:07:42] <%penitentpentwitch> Slightly less annoying than consistent high pitched noises
[2:07:44] <cephas97> cant you turn it down on options?
[2:07:54] <cephas97> less blood on screen
[2:07:57] <%FutaSnek> @Afterman_ I wouldn't be surprised if they designed their skeleton and animations to look similar enough to just work with both models
[2:07:59] <Pookiedaexzile> Best Blood Screen is Gears of war
[2:08:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> Oh look its satan
[2:08:03] <%jjolion> When i first played this game with my friends, we took a shot everytime we got jumpscared, mia was a bitch
[2:08:03] <%CoreyOfMyLife> You could probably mod it out
[2:08:13] <Pookiedaexzile> it slowly makes the gears logo in the center screen and helps you aim
[2:08:14] <heartlesshealer> that was great
[2:08:16] <+OwlLightningMage> The kingdom hearts low HP alarm is so distressing
[2:08:19] <+aeronauticaljon> Oh hey mold
[2:08:21] <Arek_1> LUL
[2:08:23] <%FutaSnek> @heartlesshealer Yea that's pretty intense but understandable

[2:08:45] <%ragingbrachy> monkaS
[2:08:47] <$Afterman_> @FutaSnek their jump back/horizontal swipe animation looks almost identical lol
[2:08:48] <%penitentpentwitch> First person dodge moves... wouldn't be a fan
[2:08:49] <rytisone> imagine if Ethan had Jill's valen-time
[2:08:54] <Gorgs7> @PatStaresAt If you get a treat bag that attaches to your hip, you always have food, baby will always listen

[2:09:27] <%ragingbrachy> lockpicks 🤢
[2:09:33] <heartlesshealer> that's where he learned to punch good
[2:09:37] <FutaSnek> @Afterman_ I mean you know what your doing on the RE team when someone tells you to make the 4 legged skeleton that crawls on walls LUL
[2:09:41] <%mikessdd> Jack punch good
[2:09:46] <rytisone> 4:20
[2:09:49] <%ragingbrachy> 5:08 EST
[2:09:52] <+OwlLightningMage> Jack was an RE protagonist that decided to have sex instead
[2:09:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Marines are ether huge badasses or cuddly teddy bears that could kill you
[2:09:54] <%toolofparanoia> BROTHER IS MORE BADASS
[2:09:55] <%GeneralSCPatton> All RE games should have an unlockable speed mode that feels like the Striker exploit from RE4 Wii.
[2:09:57] <%penitentpentwitch> @Pookiedaexzile It mostly depends on how it's handled. It's a very easy avenue to mess up.
[2:09:59] <Guardiansaiyan> 12
[2:10:01] <Guardiansaiyan> 9
[2:10:03] <rekinom> That means he tries to groom kids on twitch to join the military right?
[2:10:05] <KaiserMario> If Jack was a Marine, was Joe like a green beret?
[2:10:07] <%toolofparanoia> HE PUNCHES GATERS
[2:10:16] <bookofmouths> thats in the fun time basement
[2:10:28] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker vs Kiryu LUL
[2:10:34] <Guardiansaiyan> 12
[2:10:36] <SmolBluGhost> was joe a seal
[2:10:47] <heartlesshealer> something divisible by 3
[2:10:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> Jack was a marine Joe was the guy who beats up marines for fun
[2:10:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Joe Baker with a gater on his back
[2:10:48] <%Loinclothiclese> @doc_ock_rokc Huge cuddly teddy bear badasse's
[2:10:56] <%FutaSnek> Joe baker didnt need the military the military needed him
[2:11:01] <+EySoyCoco> 23:15
[2:11:02] <Gorgs7> wasn't it 10:15
[2:11:09] <%ragingbrachy> DansGame
[2:11:23] <rytisone> party over there
[2:11:29] <+EySoyCoco> almost
[2:11:35] <%jjolion> So if your brain has been infected by the mold, how come you're not crazy like the rest of the family? is it because plot?
[2:11:35] <%ragingbrachy> you might need the shotgun ammo later
[2:11:36] <BaronHoncho> cuz goblins
[2:11:38] <%FutaSnek> Handgun is usefull for more situations
[2:11:39] <Aydarkzero> b/c it's the shotgun
[2:11:41] <+aeronauticaljon> But shotgun the best
[2:11:41] <%FutaSnek> so it gets used more
[2:11:44] <%DappercatEsquire> Sounds like the same issue with item hoarding in RPGs
[2:11:45] <Gorgs7> dammit, I never actually even played this game, I still know it's 10:15
[2:11:45] <oniwahoo> Why would you use shotgun ammo tho?
[2:11:48] <+OwlLightningMage> Shotgun ammo is valuable though
[2:11:51] <%penitentpentwitch> Shotgun is that weird place between "Is this a boss weapon or a mook weapon"?
[2:11:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Instead of blood vignetting, mushroom vignetting
[2:11:53] <indig0bird> @rekinom They got banned for that, so the problem of the military grooming kids, often poor and downtrotten, is done forever!
[2:12:05] <%mikessdd> it's a slow burn
[2:12:05] <%FutaSnek> MAN LUCAS STARTIN YOUNG EH?
[2:12:07] <rytisone> Lucas also eats cereal and milk separately

[2:12:23] <Aydarkzero> monkaS
[2:12:24] <KaiserMario> I always thought that the molded should have some sembance of who they were, kinda like how the dead cop looks now
[2:12:28] <%mikessdd> my mouth is the bowl

[2:12:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> Lucas is actually smart
[2:12:44] <%PettyFunk> I love that they're trophies for NOT WINNING
[2:12:45] <oniwahoo> Lucas given some real Peter Wiggin feels
[2:12:45] <%GarbageNirvana> wasn't Lucas actually in on a lot of this
[2:12:47] <%FutaSnek> Its prolly my fav detail of re7
[2:12:48] <%cowardlord> Why would he write that down?
[2:13:07] <%thequietwelshman> thequietwelshman subscribed with Twitch Prime.

[2:13:09] <oniwahoo> @cowardlord He loves being evil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[2:13:12] <Pookiedaexzile> Who dropped that
[2:13:20] <%g0atmeal> Dear diary, today I committed many crimes
[2:13:27] <%FutaSnek> @GarbageNirvana Yeah umbrella got a lab set up for him after they realized he was smart enough to just cure himself
[2:13:29] <%GarbageNirvana> maybe he's just planting long like this and make it look like he was just another victim the mold instead of one of the propagators
[2:13:29] <%mikessdd> Mr President
[2:13:35] <cephas97> GEORGE TREVOR

[2:18:26] <heartlesshealer> aboard for lucas town
[2:18:26] <%bevyrage> Would a scope then be a gun hat? A hat that lets you see?
[2:18:29] <+aeronauticaljon> Its like a silent fart
[2:18:33] <heartlesshealer> all aboard*
[2:18:37] <ha2ken> It stops the gun from biting other people

[2:26:44] <mutantlunchbox1> If he's wearing different pant then we will know
[2:27:00] <heartlesshealer> At least Pat didn't get so constipated that he had to go to the hospital

[2:39:25] <$floralkami> @scrumbotime thick rubber
[2:39:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Dakuu75 this is world that doesn't follow any rules of conservation of mass
[2:39:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Lucas would make a thing like this
[2:39:29] <lilichar33> oooowwwwaaaaaaaa
[2:39:31] <+trashcansan> It's kinda funny how lucas is an idiot savant that only makes torture puzzles
[2:39:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> AND UNREALISTIC
[2:39:32] <%AncelDeLambert> this thing is Boston Dynamics complicated
[2:39:34] <SirKeigan> And fucking creepy
[2:39:34] <StebTheVee> Clancy just keeps getting tortured
[2:39:34] <+StrawberryPantsu> LOSER
[2:39:39] <%madskull456> why was there a drill noise?
[2:39:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> Lucas can program, ill give him that

[2:39:49] <%ragingbrachy> isnt lucas like a megagenius
[2:39:52] <+NitronStreams> remember Lucas is a fuckin nerd with way to much time
[2:39:54] <+DeRedBaron> not just complicated, so specific it would require a miracle for it to work
[2:39:55] <+bugz_munny> hes got zambie juice
[2:39:58] <$Dakuu75> @doc_ock_rokc apparently
[2:39:59] <%Dr_DangerPhD> knowing Lucas it's probably remote controlled and the clockwork bit is misdirection
[2:40:00] <%dantejoestar21> dantejoestar21 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! 
[2:40:01] <%DappercatEsquire> soy un perdado

[2:40:40] <%AncelDeLambert> isn't Lucas being payed by someone?
[2:40:43] <%doc_ock_rokc> @oniwahoo lucas apparently sells information to red umbrella
[2:40:43] <%FutaSnek> I asssume umbrella Gave Lucas a pretty big research grant he built alot of this shit with
[2:40:43] <$floralkami> @ragingbrachy Lucas is like that character in the Rainman, only super smart and talented in one or a few connected fields
[2:40:44] <+bugz_munny> woooo
[2:40:44] <Aydarkzero> FeelsBirthdayMan
[2:40:49] <Talfri> Don't get me wrong I love RE7 but most horror games and puzzles make big leaps in logic and RE7 is no exception
[2:40:56] <$Dakuu75> true
[2:40:56] <+evbites> he did'nt
[2:40:57] <%AncelDeLambert> yeah, and he got it repainted in like a day

[2:41:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> but he barely is screaming
[2:41:11] <BurdRightsActivist> NO NOT THE BEES
[2:41:11] <SchroedingersFerret> Asbestos

[2:41:15] <Guardiansaiyan> yikes
[2:41:16] <%NovaKnightmare> Poor Clancy burns for a while
[2:41:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> Sprinklers still exist so maybe he can remotely set them off
[2:41:20] <%AncelDeLambert> the room looks the same, it has the same walls, it's repainted
[2:41:20] <%FutaSnek> FIRE IS HOT
[2:41:21] <+NitronStreams> RIP Clancy
[2:41:21] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> he really likes to say "awaawawawaw"
[2:41:23] <gamezerox> Not to mention rebuilding the whole thing again
[2:41:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> I would've intentionally burned it down out of spite
[2:41:25] <rytisone> crispy
[2:41:25] <Saltmeisterr> AUUUUGGHHH
[2:41:25] <oniwahoo> @futasnek Almost makes creating monsters seem worthwhile if they're willing to fork out for this shit
[2:41:26] <$Dakuu75> lol
[2:41:26] <vaderxyz1970> Dont you remember DSP 2
[2:41:26] <Gorgs7> well that's why he's basically in a totally different building Pat
[2:41:28] <BallerSwagBro9k> S Tier VA LUL
[2:41:29] <%ragingbrachy> he died due
[2:41:31] <lilichar33> calm down dude
[2:41:32] <%AncelDeLambert> like, fucking hell, Lucas, you raise a barn just cuz you're bored?
[2:41:32] <%ragingbrachy> dude*
[2:41:36] <0rond> @PatStaresAt the house isn't that flammable natrually, there was ton of oil to cause that
[2:41:37] <heartlesshealer> if you turn the water back on, it's not water
[2:41:39] <%SirGO0SE> LUL LUL
[2:41:46] <+bugz_munny> fire retardant
[2:41:48] <$Dakuu75> I think if he tried to turn the valve back on, it's break, right?
[2:41:51] <MissFantasy> i share the same birthday as clancy
[2:41:53] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, he remakes THE ENTIRE PUZZLE HOUSE?
[2:41:54] <$Afterman_> probably some material that fire cant burn
[2:41:54] <%Meekest> Sprinklers I guess
[2:41:55] <+lordericter> lots of asbestos in the walls
[2:41:57] <$Afterman_> idk
[2:41:57] <%ragingbrachy> fireproof walls and such
[2:41:57] <lilichar33> just tell the fire no
[2:42:00] <+trashcansan> maybe there's a sprinkler system or it's covered in asbestos
[2:42:02] <%AncelDeLambert> LUCAS JUST PLAY VIDEOGAMES, DUDE!
[2:42:02] <+sp_abadidea> what's holding Clancy's camera if he's using both his hands for the puzzle? =U
[2:42:05] <%AkronymCLT> Tons of Asbestos
[2:42:14] <+durthknight> how did the recording survive?
[2:42:15] <$floralkami> you know houses don't burn down THAT easily, right?
[2:42:17] <BurdRightsActivist> He bought a fireproof wall from Umbrelazon
[2:42:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> Go pro
[2:42:18] <%AncelDeLambert> ... go pro?
[2:42:18] <%madskull456> just rebuild the whole room again
[2:42:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> Asbestos keeps out the rats and fires!
[2:42:25] <%jinking79> Wat was that tap made out of
[2:42:35] <%AncelDeLambert> they don't burn down that easily when you CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
[2:42:35] <BurdRightsActivist> RAVE Pog
[2:42:39] <+bugz_munny> I like this scene
[2:42:48] <%AncelDeLambert> does Lucas just have a massive fuck off hose and water pump?
[2:42:49] <%ScottishMadJacko> I like the rave aethestic
[2:42:52] <+aeronauticaljon> @doc_ock_rokc just don't breath that shit in
[2:42:53] <$Dakuu75> I swear to god, brute force could break most of these puzzles lol
[2:42:55] <+bugz_munny> boat sucks
[2:42:58] <+StrawberryPantsu> Boat was fun
[2:43:00] <+lordericter> yeah the boat fuckin sucks
[2:43:02] <%AncelDeLambert> this room is so goddamn forgetable
[2:43:03] <%ragingbrachy> the boat 🤢
[2:43:03] <%NDHCemployee> I think most people dislike the boat
[2:43:05] <+ConAirOnDVD> The boat and everything after are absolutely the weakest parts of this game
[2:43:08] <%Meekest> Oh no not this part
[2:43:08] <+StrawberryPantsu> This game was front loaded as fuck though
[2:43:09] <Guardiansaiyan> ew
[2:43:11] <%Agami23> what about the mines?
[2:43:12] <%DappercatEsquire> you don't like the exposition boat?
[2:43:13] <%R3Roundabout> Why would you sit in the chair?
[2:43:14] <+bugz_munny> Lucas is tweaker creepy
[2:43:15] <lilichar33> ewwww crusty
[2:43:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> The worlds most fire retardant material is actually edible to humans
[2:43:17] <LordOfThePoultry> DansGame
[2:43:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> God lucas always looked lieka crack head
[2:43:18] <%ragingbrachy> the game falls off at the boat onwards FeelsBadMan
[2:43:18] <%AncelDeLambert> by "this" I mean the fat guy rave house
[2:43:18] <%penitentpentwitch> It is interesting that RE7 motif is 'Family' and RE8 looks to be 'Parenthood'
[2:43:19] <rytisone> and mines. shoulda been bigger
[2:43:24] <0rond> the boat is supposed to be eveline section but ends up being molded section...
[2:43:25] <DrkJP520> I'm a sucker for boat levels. cruise ships specifically
[2:43:28] <%ragingbrachy> a alien
[2:43:36] <abuse_of_mousse> NotLikeThis
[2:43:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> Lucas VA is so fucking good
[2:43:37] <SirKeigan> The boat is the exposition section
[2:43:37] <+trashcansan> lucas can build a bunch of robots and mechanics but struggles with a camera. True idiot savant.
[2:43:40] <BurdRightsActivist> FEETUS
[2:43:44] <%DappercatEsquire> is that a ham
[2:43:46] <%ragingbrachy> a weird cup to drink fruit drinks from
[2:43:49] <lilichar33> yeehaw
[2:43:50] <+DeRedBaron> when super bunny hop made his review on teh game he brought up stuff like that half the game is amazing but the other half looks like it was handled by a different team and there were conflicts throughout and one possible result is the boat
[2:43:51] <+bugz_munny> the acting here is great
[2:43:56] <abuse_of_mousse> monkaS
[2:44:04] <%FutaSnek> The boat should have been at the start HEAR ME OUT it would have been a perfect tone setter to go from the crazy bullshit to the somewhat "normal" mansion. and you could have just had her send the msg at the end of the sequence like normal and it would have worked canonically
[2:44:06] <%argavus> lucas seems like an actual person
[2:44:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Lucas is an evil idiot savant, it's so wierd
[2:44:12] <SpaceGuntank> AUGH NO
[2:44:13] <%ragingbrachy> yeah if i could do that i would love it
[2:44:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> He does a good job pretending hes under her control
[2:44:18] <illtima> I thought he's mold-free. WHy is he talking to Eveline?
[2:44:21] <Talfri> VA did a great job
[2:44:23] <%NovaKnightmare> Lucas somehow gets to have Regen but has his individuality
[2:44:24] <BurdRightsActivist> Get the fuck out of my room Evelyn I'M PLAYING MINECRAFT
[2:44:30] <%AncelDeLambert> he's mold free LATER
[2:44:31] <Gallhint> He looks like a sick bald charlie kelly
[2:44:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> Isnt he?
[2:44:35] <$Afterman_> he has control over himself
[2:44:37] <%Skelegroove> Why does he care if zoe wants to cure herself?
[2:44:39] <+bugz_munny> He got freedom juice
[2:44:42] <%penitentpentwitch> He still has 'control'
[2:44:45] <oniwahoo> I mean, he isn't wrong, what the mold does in regards to the abilities it gives you is pretty cool
[2:44:46] <%dekkitout> Did the mold come from bad potato salad?
[2:44:46] <+tigerfang86> he's got some Normal Juice
[2:44:50] <%ScottishMadJacko> I thought he was cured and was just pretending
[2:44:50] <%ragingbrachy> sweet deal
[2:44:51] <%toastybites> ah mold magic
[2:44:52] <%DappercatEsquire> the Fambly
[2:44:57] <Aydarkzero> yeah so she sort of just bothers him every now and then LUL
[2:44:57] <%FutaSnek> SO like the best deal in RE thusfar
[2:44:57] <+bugz_munny> but hes still crazy AF
[2:44:58] <SirKeigan> "Some" Bio-Ogrganization
[2:45:00] <0rond> I think eveline doesn't care about him that much in the first place to enforce control too much
[2:45:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> And used the heal meds to pretend to regen
[2:45:01] <$Trenr> so he really is just an asshole
[2:45:03] <$Afterman_> I like how Lucas is the new saga Wesker.
[2:45:04] <StebTheVee> Unfortunatley, he's just evil
[2:45:07] <+lordericter> unfortunately normal Lucas is still a sociopath
[2:45:08] <mutantlunchbox1> just a light sniff
[2:45:08] <+tigerfang86> FUCK
[2:45:09] <jimmytwofeet> what is this.......Boivin
[2:45:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> And he actually molds up in the dlc
[2:45:10] <+sp_abadidea> doesn't he turn into a Mold Monster in the Chris DLC?
[2:45:10] <lilichar33> owie
[2:45:10] <cherubs_anonymous> So in short Lucas is just "like that"
[2:45:12] <%ragingbrachy> the umbrella juice
[2:45:13] <$floralkami> he was already crazy, so that didn't change
[2:45:13] <%Sdeje> Aside from the insanity of course
[2:45:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Lucas is better at bioterrorism than Wesker
[2:45:14] <%stabbityrabbit> Oh my god is he the RE lich to Wesker's vampire?
[2:45:15] <+DappercatEsquire> Da Fambly
[2:45:15] <+bugz_munny> I hate it

[2:45:26] <0rond> he isn't part of her ideal family but doesn't interfere so she doesn't do much about him

[2:45:29] <Guardiansaiyan> @AncelDeLambert BLASPHEMY
[2:45:29] <StebTheVee> For someone who looks like a hillbilly junkie, Lucas is pretty smart
[2:45:29] <%rissaleigh14> So he’s just fucked up

[2:54:24] <dinnydanny777> @talfri But the healing juice does repair limbs right?
[2:54:40] <%FutaSnek> Nah Joe uses the power of V O D O O to get ripped

[2:55:09] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 yes it does, you can use it to reattach your foot
[2:55:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> Maybe his hand was cut off for too long for it to heal properly

[2:57:13] <BurdRightsActivist> BURN BURN BURN TO THE GROUND
[2:57:15] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dinnydanny777 The heal juice is only so effective because it is accelerating the mold regen power
[2:57:31] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 well it's probably not just the medicine; being infected with the Mold gives a big healing factor and Ethan is heavily implied to be infected
[2:57:34] <%FutaSnek> Im gonna assume the molded dont eat him
[2:57:37] <Pookiedaexzile> Dey only way to defeat a fat man....is to Burn it
[2:57:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Chester_goes_Berserk they don't attack molded normal people
[2:57:40] <%madskull456> maybe cow prods
[2:57:44] <%DappercatEsquire> or he used a broom to herd them around
[2:57:44] <%Typhaeon> You might say he molded them to his will
[2:57:47] <rytisone> he lured him with candy
[2:57:48] <Talfri> and the medicine probably just helps accelerate the healing

[3:13:02] <mattdel92> Ralph Naders Nipple Blaster
[3:13:03] <rytisone> I feel like this next boss fight was supposed to be Lucas, but then they decided to put him in the DLC, so it's just Jack's back now.
[3:13:04] <%FutaSnek> HIS NAME IS PAT AND HE LIKES TO SWEAT, HIS ORB IS ROUND, AND HIS PEPPERONIS ARE WET
[3:13:05] <+xeros720> i always thought pat was an adult orb
[3:13:05] <%penitentpentwitch> He is an ammo soak
[3:13:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yeah
[3:13:13] <dinnydanny777> Dysentery is the disease you get from dirty water in open wounds right

[3:13:53] <+ConLin_Arts_> LUL
[3:13:55] <dinnydanny777> Mia's kind of a shit anyway
[3:13:56] <%ScottishMadJacko> God cant you just divorce mia there and marry zoe
[3:13:56] <+xeros720> you get dysentary from drinking dirty water
[3:13:56] <mattdel92> @dinnydanny777 Dysentery is just like infection in general i think
[3:13:57] <+NitronStreams> HURREH ETHAN
[3:13:57] <%asgard147> "I find you acceptable Father!" psaPorgmo
[3:14:05] <+OK__Gamer> 1 sec zo
[3:14:09] <$Dakuu75> @dinnydanny777 totally
[3:14:10] <DraxTD> Pat fails at efeciant gaming
[3:14:14] <%ScottishMadJacko> I wish choosing zoe was the good end and not the bad end
[3:14:21] <heartlesshealer> dysentery is the intestine stuff
[3:14:23] <jacksawjack> Isn't right before they deploy the kitty claw death grasp with built in blending action?
[3:14:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> Or have there be two good ends
[3:14:25] <bookofmouths> speed run ruined
[3:14:28] <%TheGreatSkenardo> She is cool
[3:14:29] <%FutaSnek> Zoe is a better waifu tbh
[3:14:32] <+NitronStreams> Hurreh and give Zoeh the ingredients
[3:14:35] <rytisone> chewie zoning
[3:14:36] <JobbedBone> OMEGALUL HE DOESN'T KNOW OMEGALUL
[3:14:39] <%koolaid_kevster> the ingredients require gunpowder pat!
[3:14:40] <Sartastic> Zoe did nothing wrong
[3:14:41] <Aydarkzero> always pick Zoe
[3:14:42] <%GeneralSCPatton> Is there any reason you can't make 2 doses? Does it really take 1 whole fetus jerky per dose?
[3:14:48] <mattdel92> I stand corrected
[3:14:50] <%penitentpentwitch> "The Helpful One" vs "The Murdery One"
[3:14:50] <%rumtumtugnutz> Dysentery means you shit yourself to death
[3:14:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like why cant she just become anime like she does in the good end
[3:14:55] <+ConLin_Arts_> monkaS
[3:15:04] <+scrumbotime> Just juice the baby parts
[3:15:04] <%mikessdd> even though you don't know Zoe technically I prefer her competence
[3:15:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @GeneralSCPatton two is what they are making but there are 3 infected
[3:15:06] <$Dakuu75> I mean, that's a lot of material, it looks enough for 3-4 at least
[3:15:06] <%GeneralSCPatton> Or rather 1 extra dose
[3:15:10] <+Remery_> Muh Family
[3:15:11] <+AXL808> mah wyff
[3:15:12] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Heheh Daddys Coming
[3:15:12] <rytisone> short hair vs. long hair
[3:15:13] <zerch69> i love how she just puts it in a food processor
[3:15:15] <%weissguard> ZoEH
[3:15:22] <%FutaSnek> LOOKIN GREAT JACK
[3:15:27] <Aydarkzero> upside down face monkaS
[3:15:29] <+AXL808> PAIGE?!
[3:15:30] <mattdel92> Long hair every time
[3:15:30] <%etnoika> Don't you become unable to do the one DLC if you choose Zoe?
[3:15:37] <ha2ken> That's how we do to the bayou
[3:15:37] <heartlesshealer> a giant flesh monster
[3:15:38] <%penitentpentwitch> Berkin be proud
[3:15:38] <%BleedinActionMan> That's a Resident Evil boss and a half right there
[3:15:40] <BallerSwagBro9k> BING CHUNGUS
[3:15:46] <lilichar33> wow what a hunk
[3:15:48] <BallerSwagBro9k> THE DEEP SOUTH
[3:15:49] <%Keyd00d> This isn't even his final form
[3:15:49] <+OK__Gamer> it's a "gift"
[3:15:50] <bookofmouths> give jack the serum
[3:15:55] <BurdRightsActivist> SHOOT HIS BIG STUPID EYES
[3:15:55] <dinnydanny777> Kind of lame that you don't get to actually kill a Tyrant
[3:16:01] <%doc_ock_rokc> nice shot
[3:16:02] <%ScottishMadJacko> good shot
[3:16:05] <+NitronStreams> Hit the road Jack
[3:16:09] <%GeneralSCPatton> @doc_ock_rokc Then I meant to say 3 doses. I remembered the choice but not that Ethan needs one too.
[3:16:13] <BallerSwagBro9k> This is why incest is a no no
[3:16:14] <mattdel92> What is it with RE and eyeballs???
[3:16:15] <oniwahoo> It's real weird that Ethan took bolth shots at all or that Zoe held them bolth out for him to take
[3:16:23] <%stabbityrabbit> So Jack is basically mold Birkin, right?
[3:16:24] <%FutaSnek> It's horrible how much he's still concious of everything even though he must be in unbelievable pain monkaS
[3:16:29] <%Aleate> Hey guys remember that time that Pat missed shooting Jack with the Magnum? Good times.
[3:16:29] <heartlesshealer> so what even caught fire???
[3:16:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> IS mold related to G
[3:16:34] <%DappercatEsquire> Oh my Jack, you've... you've grown.
[3:16:34] <Aydarkzero> @mattdel92 they make great weak spots
[3:16:35] <BallerSwagBro9k> Screen is dark
[3:16:35] <%BakiinPlaysStuff> Ethan is staring down a molded up nightmare and is spitting out one liners. Who is this guy?
[3:16:37] <ha2ken> When you have to deal with the gf's dad
[3:16:38] <MayorRev> shut up it's creepy Kappa
[3:16:40] <indig0bird> Wow, they really improved the shot sound effects later
[3:16:41] <%penitentpentwitch> 4/6 shots landed
[3:16:42] <%FacetiousAF> is this the end of the game?
[3:16:48] <%ScottishMadJacko> Bold move
[3:16:48] <dinnydanny777> Why does a tyrant cure the mold anyway
[3:16:50] <@SoFarFetched> no still more
[3:16:58] <BallerSwagBro9k> @facetiousaf nope
[3:17:01] <Aydarkzero> @FacetiousAF yeah almost
[3:17:04] <$Afterman_> @penitentpentwitch 66% isnt too bad
[3:17:14] <+AXL808> i know herbs are great for healing, but RE7 really shows how insanely effective Umbrella pharmaceuticals really are
[3:17:14] <%GeneralSCPatton> @bakiinplaysstuff Ethan should be rolling SAN Checks at this Bloodborne shit
[3:17:15] <%Typhaeon> Nice speen

[3:17:55] <%FacetiousAF> this is a bloodborne

[3:19:19] <%ScottishMadJacko> Yeah, hes totally reminiscient of those leech fuckers at the cathedral of the deep
[3:19:21] <%FutaSnek> Man jack should've just like waited on the roof... then jumped on all 3 of them when they got on the boat... they would have been turbo fucked
[3:19:23] <%BleedinActionMan> He sounds like he's trying not to cry
[3:19:37] <+pandamancer224> @PatStaresAt what is it with RE and eyes?

[3:20:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> I mean theyre a solid weakpoint
[3:20:04] <%CzeekyPlays> Fuck you
[3:20:05] <%penitentpentwitch> They're fairly obvious weakpoints, biologically
[3:20:10] <%FutaSnek> THE G VIRUS REQUIRES MAXIMUM EYEBALSSSSS
[3:20:11] <+blastazoid26> Yes, it does
[3:20:11] <heartlesshealer> Carve
[3:20:13] <DracaenaLeaf> Link would survive an outbreak
[3:20:14] <%miabyte> there's something very cool about a huge mutant monster saying "Fuck You"
[3:20:16] <Daxalog> I think its just a biological """fault""" of the virus.
[3:20:16] <+Regigangster> Eye, everybody's weakness
[3:20:18] <lilichar33> haha]
[3:20:21] <%ScottishMadJacko> More vision is useful too
[3:20:26] <Reanimator83> You and Paige need to teach zangief the RE spin. I heard its a cool new dance thats sweeping the nation
[3:20:29] <%asgard147> no you ain't
[3:20:30] <Aydarkzero> got a lot of ammo
[3:20:30] <%reonome> its a horror game thing
[3:20:31] <+blastazoid26> Much better than getting shot in the colostomy bag
[3:20:35] <ha2ken> Stab the eye tho
[3:20:37] <Divantae> even Ethan didnt think he'd come back for re8 lmao
[3:20:41] <BurdRightsActivist> DAS THAT GOOD SHIT

[3:21:06] <@commanderclaw> Zoe clearly flunked math
[3:21:08] <%Agami23> it could be a hallucination
[3:21:15] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> zoe wanted to save you from your bitchy wife
[3:21:16] <%BleedinActionMan> She tells you to cure him fully expecting you to use the other one on her
[3:21:16] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like zoe is even the one who checks if youre ok, mia isnt concerned
[3:21:21] <dinnydanny777> And now it turns him into a creepy cobwebs monster

[3:25:22] <dinnydanny777> How did the boat get from the sea to a SWAMP

[3:26:09] <%Skelegroove> It gives her a resistance to mold

[3:26:10] <MayorRev> cheevos
[3:26:10] <lilichar33> oh yea you play as mia
[3:26:10] <dinnydanny777> Why did they not just wait until later to give someone the cure
[3:26:12] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Are You going to continue this marathon till the REVillage comes out? BTw whens that coming out?
[3:26:12] <black_pariah> fucking paige
[3:26:18] <lilichar33> oh no
[3:26:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> That's why you get out and then take it
[3:26:21] <+pandamancer224> if you save zoe do you still do this part?
[3:26:23] <%Typhaeon> Ethan DeGeneres
[3:26:27] <%etnoika> Wait she gets infected again? I thought she couldn't do this if she was infected
[3:26:29] <Camail> yoink
[3:26:31] <ha2ken> Ethan will now turn into Venom
[3:26:31] <%Bt_Robot> Tetanus valley, that's what this place should be called
[3:26:31] <+StrawberryPantsu> he might as well be one
[3:26:32] <Sartastic> my husbando
[3:26:32] <Camail> my husband now
[3:26:32] <%ScottishMadJacko> @dinnydanny777 Cause evie can melt people infected with mold apparently at will
[3:26:33] <%ragingbrachy> scooped
[3:26:33] <+Regigangster> And then Ethan fucking died
[3:26:33] <lilichar33> welp
[3:26:38] <%weissguard> Is Ethan blonde? Huh.
[3:26:39] <Divantae> Ethan is Henry
[3:26:40] <%Aleate> I find it hilarious that the character model for Ethan doesn't have eyes and half his face
[3:26:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @pandamancer224 yeah, the game forces this part regardless
[3:26:43] <CrimsonGargoyle> @Typhaeon LUL
[3:26:44] <%BleedinActionMan> @pandamancer224 as Ethan
[3:26:47] <%miabyte> I still think Ethan is a pretty 'plain' protag as protags go
[3:26:47] <MayorRev> a who protagonist?
[3:26:50] <$Dakuu75> the grabboid got'em
[3:26:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Typhaeon ....damn thats actually good...
[3:26:57] <dinnydanny777> @scottishmadjacko Oh right, but she doesn't even though Mia is infected
[3:27:00] <%BoneofMalkav> Ethan wants to know if you've seen a little girl around. Dark Hair, short...
[3:27:09] <%Bt_Robot> Has there been a single piece of metal that wasn't rusted to shit?
[3:27:10] <jacksawjack> Yeah the game could really use mods to turn the molded into more interesting enemies.
[3:27:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> I swear ethan is secretly hunk or some shit
[3:27:13] <%miabyte> I know nothing about ethans character
[3:27:14] <%madskull456> the anime took ethan
[3:27:18] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> oh no the poor fishe
[3:27:25] <%Aleate> This boat is C U R S E D
[3:27:27] <%Typhaeon> @doc_ock_rokc It's even more uncanny in t hat third person mod thing
[3:27:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> @dinnydanny777 thats what makes no sense, cause she melts zoe in the bad end
[3:27:34] <+ConLin_Arts_> BOAT

[3:27:50] <dinnydanny777> Boats are pretty spooky
[3:27:50] <%miabyte> Like the family has way more character developments than the protag. Super odd.
[3:27:51] <%Littlecjmajor> re6 is more boat than game
[3:27:52] <%bevyrage> it was in line with the uncharted series' boat fascination right?

[3:30:50] <%bevyrage> Why would you need people to run the boat? It floats on water, not on roads~
[3:30:58] <%TheActuallyGuy> I hate this boat section

[3:31:36] <+Regigangster> Hooray futility
[3:31:37] <%Maids4lyfe> or the cure was bullshit and never worked

[3:32:51] <Divantae> she a bioweapon

[3:33:46] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh my god.....
[3:33:47] <+Pendlez> @penitentpentwitch some of the bosses are flesh mechs I guess
[3:33:48] <dinnydanny777> @generalscpatton If you do Mia should immediately become infected again, she looks filthy
[3:33:49] <%Skelegroove> I don't think she gets reinfected just that the serum works slowly
[3:33:51] <TrollKing96> She's a bioweapon with the mentality of a child. That's a dangerous combination.
[3:33:55] <jacksawjack> Mia's section is the worst
[3:33:58] <%mikessdd> Yes Pat. Do the true RE strats. RUN
[3:33:59] <ha2ken> When are we getting Mecha-Zangief?
[3:34:03] <%xcompleasedad> Pro-Strat
[3:34:07] <%Dementedpenguin> I was thinking "this part reminds me of another game" and I realized I was thinking of RE7.....
[3:34:08] <%Maids4lyfe> @FutaSnek Umbrella didn't make her, she was from the competition
[3:34:09] <%TheActuallyGuy> @penitentpentwitch nope. you fly a fighter jet in 6 though.
[3:34:19] <%Maids4lyfe> LUL
[3:34:19] <%stabbityrabbit> @FutaSnek Implying that Umbrella has non-creepy-bioweapon branch.
[3:34:20] <%FutaSnek> WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE FART GAS FROM 6
[3:34:22] <@commanderclaw> Why couldn't they make her a dog? Dogs are way easier to control
[3:34:25] <Aydarkzero> ye
[3:34:25] <%ragingbrachy> dude she sucks
[3:34:27] <%FutaSnek> WAS THAT NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH
[3:34:27] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[3:34:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like why would the bio weapon listen to you
[3:34:33] <heartlesshealer> zero foresight
[3:34:37] <CrimsonGargoyle> so basically umbrella being umbrella
[3:34:40] <%FutaSnek> @stabbityrabbit This is true
[3:34:41] <%xcompleasedad> They didn't have the resources to?
[3:34:43] <%penitentpentwitch> Their safety measure for the kid was she'd die from rapid aging
[3:34:45] <jacksawjack> Yes they did, a fake family
[3:34:45] <+aeronauticaljon> More like a 'fuck the world' weapon
[3:34:45] <dinnydanny777> I forgot that we're playing as Mia
[3:34:51] <Storm_Samurai> FAMILY...FAMILY...family
[3:34:51] <oniwahoo> Cuz all their other programs have really tried, right?
[3:34:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt She was meant to be left on a battle field taken in by an enemy and become a trojan horse
[3:34:52] <%xcompleasedad> Very stupidly
[3:34:53] <+Taglog7> famli famli famli
[3:34:53] <%Aleate> Bye bitch LUL
[3:34:55] <dinnydanny777> Family, Family, Family
[3:34:57] <Divantae> they shouldn't have given her free will lol did someone knock over the bio free will juice
[3:35:00] <jacksawjack> It just failed
[3:35:03] <%ScottishMadJacko> I mean the hunter gammas in 3make were friendly apparently
[3:35:03] <%mikessdd> fuck umbrella
[3:35:04] <rytisone> it's the new fast and furious movie
[3:35:04] <%penitentpentwitch> Which is not an ethical, nor effective measure
[3:35:05] <%TheActuallyGuy> 7's BOWs weren't really thought out well at all.
[3:35:09] <The_Pasta_Paladin> Eveline's concept is GENIUS but the protocols to keep her under control is STUPID
[3:35:09] <ha2ken> Remember....RE7 is about family.
[3:35:12] <%Emperor_Machinus> we had viruses, parasites and mold what could be next?
[3:35:15] <BallerSwagBro9k> Is she a kid with a bioweapon inside or straight up a bioweapon that inexplicably has a human form
[3:35:18] <%BleedinActionMan> What if she just dies?
[3:35:19] <dinnydanny777> So there's literally no way to control her at all?
[3:35:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> Yeah
[3:35:24] <%Agami23> she is about as bad as hunters and lickers
[3:35:24] <Storm_Samurai> Why even have a human bioweapon, just a container of goo is fine
[3:35:26] <@commanderclaw> Is the RE universe constantly at war? Cause there's a huge fucking market for bioweapons
[3:35:26] <%Agami23> and zombies.
[3:35:26] <%Typhaeon> Battlefield? Century and a half too late for the Civil War, Umbrella
[3:35:28] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like what do you do after, fire bomb her?
[3:35:30] <heartlesshealer> there's no way to have her behave until she's deployed
[3:35:30] <%mikessdd> wow vhs really does work through anything
[3:35:33] <%xcompleasedad> @Emperor_Machinus Nanomachines, SON!
[3:35:38] <%NDHCemployee> @BallerSwagBro9k Pretty sure it's the latter
[3:35:38] <%FutaSnek> If she just dies a area is still MEGAFUCKED
[3:35:41] <+Ancopro> V bucks
[3:35:41] <+Taglog7> Re7 and the Fast and Furious about Famly
[3:35:41] <artoflec> well Umbrella IS known for their super smart evil master plans
[3:35:43] <%Maids4lyfe> no Hunters were successful
[3:35:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> Like most of the BOWs, you just convert the enemy force into a worse monster force and have to clean that up instead.
[3:35:47] <%Maids4lyfe> they could be trained
[3:35:48] <%marsantas> I think the plan is she'd go in, infect everyone, kill them and then she'd die of old age and they'd all go away?
[3:35:49] <The_Pasta_Paladin> Yeah zero control = basically a super villain T-virus
[3:35:49] <CrimsonGargoyle> jobber man time
[3:35:51] <%Ynkubus_> destroy after use
[3:35:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BallerSwagBro9k A girl infected by the mold when she was a baby
[3:35:52] <%Xevtes> @PatStaresAt its a "let's see where this goes" mentality. its about the science not the execution
[3:35:53] <Divantae> not being able to say no to a child as a BOW
[3:36:00] <%mikessdd> COLD
[3:36:07] <PanicSwytch> How does that moldy vhs work? the gunk would get in the vcr
[3:36:07] <%penitentpentwitch> Knock off Umbrella, somehow stupider than the original
[3:36:08] <Storm_Samurai> He has cool bio watch too
[3:36:09] <+moink1234> grey skin
[3:36:23] <dinnydanny777> Imprinting, just like Twilight New Dawn
[3:36:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> @ndhcemployee Do they explain why she has sentience or human form?
[3:36:28] <The_Pasta_Paladin> It doesn't work and she imprints on different people!
[3:36:32] <Storm_Samurai> Everyone has Apple Watch in this universe
[3:36:34] <+OK__Gamer> isn't there a reference to a control method later on?
[3:36:34] <The_Pasta_Paladin> So who is in control??
[3:36:37] <oniwahoo> It is clearly working or Mia would be dead
[3:36:38] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Mia is a bitch though
[3:36:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> Except shes imprinting on anyone, like she imprinted on jack and his family, then on ethan
[3:36:40] <%FutaSnek> Its a neat concept but Ludicrously risky
[3:36:42] <%Ynkubus_> Also weapons engineering isnt always sane
[3:36:46] <+xddddsorandom> No control
[3:36:47] <%Typhaeon> I'd love it if Umbrella was portrayed as an incompetent startup like Theranos instead of some omnipresent evil megacorp
[3:36:50] <ThunderRemix8> evie was designed to be human so she can mix with civilians
[3:36:51] <%FutaSnek> THIS IS THAT x200
[3:36:53] <+aeronauticaljon> Unless you nuke it
[3:36:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> C virus was at least good because it burns out
[3:36:55] <+Taglog7> and we end in a lab
[3:36:56] <Daxalog> like nukes. oh wait.
[3:36:57] <+durthknight> sounds like retell management, just ass kiss her and youll be fine
[3:37:01] <%BinaryFireball> dont they usually nuke those cities?
[3:37:06] <%Agami23> gvirus was even worse.
[3:37:07] <%R3Roundabout> It's even more mobile than radiation
[3:37:08] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like you still need to nuke/sterilise after zombies
[3:37:09] <Talfri> At least with Eveline she ages fast so she has an expiration date
[3:37:13] <+sp_abadidea> I thought the eventual endgoal of the T-virus was to be a ridiculous super-serum like what Wesker got
[3:37:13] <The_Pasta_Paladin> Well T-Virus was an unexpected result of creating the Tyrants
[3:37:14] <@commanderclaw> Conventional arms are way more cost effective too
[3:37:18] <jacksawjack> And tyrants.
[3:37:18] <%ScottishMadJacko> but zombies were an accident anyway right?
[3:37:23] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> bio-weapons in real life aren't used for the reason you can't control them
[3:37:25] <dinnydanny777> I think Mia's supposed to be in control, except she clearly isn't, even before Evie escapes
[3:37:26] <%DappercatEsquire> i mean if you're looking to completely ruin a city forever, they're pretty effective
[3:37:28] <+aeronauticaljon> Its all about that property
[3:37:28] <The_Pasta_Paladin> That was umbrella's "oh shit we can't control this shit"
[3:37:32] <+StingtheKing> Tyrants were super controllable, as long as the clothing didn't get destroyed. And they were intelligent.
[3:37:33] <Aydarkzero> god it's the same thing w/ the new Jurassic park movies trying to make dino military weapons LUL
[3:37:34] <%afronooch> there are cheaper and better ways to do whatever you'd want evie to do
[3:37:37] <trianglehat> the baby

[3:37:43] <%Agami23> though in their defense, wasent the T virus just for stuff like tyrants and hunters? zombies were a accident?
[3:37:47] <jacksawjack> Well, the ultimate goal was to make Spencer immortal
[3:37:51] <%mikessdd> tyrants were the real money makers
[3:37:51] <fairore> @sp_abadidea that's what I'm thinking too
[3:37:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> Actually T virus zombies came first
[3:37:54] <StebTheVee> Why should we feel bad Chris shot Mia again?
[3:37:57] <%Skelegroove> RE2 and 3 show that one really skilled guy with a gun can totally control an entire infection

[3:38:53] <+ThomasOfTroy> Wasn't the idea to sell people the virus so they'd zombify cities, and then get the government to hire your mercenaries and fix the mess?

[3:42:25] <+StingtheKing> Somebody mentioned if they could do the rapid expansion of mass with food, they could solve the hunger crisis. Wasn't that the goal of the original Dead Rising? Why were there so few mega-monsters in that series?

[3:42:31] <+nanomachines_son1> shooting children is great
[3:42:36] <%Aleate> Is Paige getting hungry from all this mold? Kappa
[3:42:44] <%arancet> arancet subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! Sudden zombie big monsters would require taking mass, mostly carbon, from CO2. Literal photosynthesis. All the monsters are really plants. That'd also flood the air around then with pure Oxygen, explaining why they are so easy to blow up.

[3:50:47] <brambobelurkin> @Dakuu75 main reason being SMGs shoot the same caliber rounds as pistols usually .45 or 9mm so the amount of powder and kick is low especially if you have a longer barrel and stock to lean into :D

[3:53:32] <+lordericter> now that's one hell of a yeast infection
[3:53:33] <dinnydanny777> Who knew that children are quick to anger
[3:53:35] <%mikessdd> We were very invested in your characters continued existence
[3:53:37] <%SirGO0SE> the goo is u
[3:53:38] <indig0bird> @Dives__ lol
[3:53:39] <%penitentpentwitch> And then randomly ungooed
[3:53:40] <%AzureGale> I think I read this in a fanfic somewhere :x
[3:53:45] <%BinaryFireball> actually this part would be an excellent cross over intro
[3:53:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> That is one hell of a failed Fort Save
[3:53:50] <%doc_ock_rokc> infected
[3:53:52] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hey its venom
[3:53:52] <BallerSwagBro9k> Yay were done with the boat Kappa
[3:53:54] <+Tyonidus> Super excited for RE8
[3:53:56] <Arek_1> Paige: "Mmm, delicious."
[3:53:58] <+SickBangerzM9> they could realistically put dmc and RE in the same universe at this point
[3:53:58] <+Ancopro> time to blog
[3:53:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> Quick, wheres spiderman
[3:53:59] <%TheGreatSkenardo> Apparently the mold eats clothes
[3:54:01] <$Dakuu75> how do you get infected by the mold? jsut touching it? or you have to eat it?
[3:54:04] <+SickBangerzM9> Evie makes no sense
[3:54:09] <Talfri> I like how the player character just stands there and watches as someone throws up in front of them, on multiple occasions
[3:54:14] <%Emperor_Machinus> The next game's bioweapon should be cheese based
[3:54:17] <%FutaSnek> THIS SEQUENCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE OPENING INSTEAD OF JUST THE EMAIL
[3:54:19] <dinnydanny777> Mia kind of treated Ethan like shit from what we know about them ngl
[3:54:20] <rytisone> no siren in the message, must be rtx voice on
[3:54:20] <%ragingbrachy> can you stop being french FOR FIVE MINUTES
[3:54:24] <%FutaSnek> It would have ruled
[3:54:41] <fairore> @rytisone LUL
[3:54:50] <%mikessdd> I didn't eat the mold ethan I swear
[3:54:54] <+Dives__> Her teeth look weird
[3:54:55] <+SickBangerzM9> Faces are still pretty funky in this game
[3:54:59] <+Tyonidus> LMAO
[3:55:00] <Gamer76255> Impressive she put a filter to stop the alarm sound
[3:55:01] <%Typhaeon> "Sorry, Ethan"
[3:55:03] <+GuardMeShielder> She deserved it so it's fine
[3:55:04] <Storm_Samurai> if you get this, stay away? he wouldn't have known to stay away if she didn't send it
[3:55:07] <Aydarkzero> this is why i didn't pick Mia
[3:55:07] <Arek_1> @rytisone LUL
[3:55:10] <dinnydanny777> Mia is from fucking Umbrella
[3:55:13] <%mikessdd> Yea Mia sucks
[3:55:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> SEE, paige is right, mia is a cunt
[3:55:14] <%FutaSnek> ETHAN I GOTTA SHOOT YOUR WIFE 15 TIMES SO YOU CAN FUCK MY SISTER
[3:55:16] <BallerSwagBro9k> FOR THE BLOODLINE
[3:55:16] <stevenellis386> emmy award winning performance their
[3:55:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> LITErAL bioterrorist
[3:55:17] <%Agami23> we dont even know that its mia
[3:55:18] <$Dakuu75> Mia sucks... but she's still better than Abby
[3:55:19] <Talfri> WHY-HY
[3:55:19] <%penitentpentwitch> @FutaSnek Thing is, they wanted the focus to be 'The Family' with her being revealed as the villain later
[3:55:19] <SomeAsianDood> Mia's a bioterrorist
[3:55:19] <Aydarkzero> Mia is actually awful
[3:55:23] <%abrupt_abe> Mia is a Bioweapon scientist
[3:55:28] <heartlesshealer> she was delivering bioweapon for fucking Umbrella
[3:55:29] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> actually a terrorist
[3:55:33] <%Keyd00d> her voice is so bad
[3:55:35] <%weissguard> Mia is a terrible person and possibly a fucking BIO TERRORIST.
[3:55:37] <brambobelurkin> ETHAN You need to get the turkey baster. If Leon wont do it you will. Look I even shot your wife!
[3:55:40] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like mia caused all this
[3:55:43] <rytisone> fmw time
[3:55:44] <+SickBangerzM9> this cutscene and the opening are the only fake cutscenes in the game
[3:55:45] <+SickBangerzM9> why?
[3:55:45] <indig0bird> "We run and we explode!"
[3:55:46] <%stabbityrabbit> Chris just wants Ethan to bang Claire and you can't tell me otherwise.
[3:55:47] <%ragingbrachy> was that the howie long scream?
[3:55:48] <%Typhaeon> That's some Revelaitons shit
[3:55:49] <dinnydanny777> How did Mia survive this anyway
[3:55:50] <BallerSwagBro9k> ITS ALL FOR THE BLOODLINE
[3:55:52] <+NitronStreams> BIO CURSE
[3:55:53] <%ragingbrachy> did anyone else hear that?
[3:55:55] <%FutaSnek> @penitentpentwitch True, maybe cut it before you actually see evie
[3:55:58] <%Dementedpenguin> Dana Scully would explain this like it was nothing Kappa
[3:56:01] <BluBox> Was that a fucking Wilhelm scream?
[3:56:01] <%BinaryFireball> PLAYED US LIKE A FIDDLE
[3:56:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> shes the reason jack and his nice family (Not lucas) got jacked up
[3:56:02] <%Solid_Stro> Chris looks like he gained a few pounds too. After effects of the juice
[3:56:03] <+lordericter> A shame that Ethan is gonna bone Zoe instead of continuing the Redfield bloodline Chris
[3:56:07] <%Keyd00d> very fast drowning
[3:56:09] <iswearimjustdandy> This sequence is great
[3:56:09] <%mikessdd> Is Ethan the first RE protag to be hard confirmed as having sex?
[3:56:11] <SomeAsianDood> Did you know this was written by the same people that made FEAR? is the little girl motif not super OBVIOUS?
[3:56:13] <%TheGreatSkenardo> fastest drowning I ever did see
[3:56:19] <%GeneralSCPatton> The mold infected the hurricane and became a Moldnado
[3:56:20] <+StingtheKing> I never knew it was Mia that Chris shot in that trailer until this stream. That definitely hurts more.
[3:56:20] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 mold, probably; it makes everyone superhuman tough
[3:56:23] <%Maids4lyfe> @dinnydanny777 she was infected, the mold gives you super healing
[3:56:29] <BurdRightsActivist> HAHAHAHA
[3:56:30] <%Keyd00d> creepy little girls are so lame
[3:56:32] <Gallhint> This scene....ugh...

[3:56:35] <DracaenaLeaf> yea
[3:56:37] <heartlesshealer> =T
[3:56:37] <+GuardMeShielder> creepy kid
[3:56:37] <%ScottishMadJacko> Thats cringe
[3:56:37] <chaumiester> That was an ugly child
[3:56:38] <FstSergeant8595> top tier voice acting btw
[3:56:38] <$Dakuu75> it was stupid
[3:56:39] <LordOfThePoultry> 4Head
[3:56:41] <+moink1234> Worst scare ever
[3:56:42] <%SoySocks> THAT WAS AWFUL
[3:56:43] <ha2ken> That's children for ya
[3:56:43] <%Keyd00d> it's so fucking bad
[3:56:44] <heartlesshealer> weak ass scene
[3:56:46] <+OK__Gamer> hahahaha
[3:56:47] <%doc_ock_rokc> THAT CAN READ YOUR MIND
[3:56:51] <%toastybites> pride and acomplishment
[3:56:51] <%Dementedpenguin> Mia with the ........ power moves..... ? 4Head
[3:56:52] <%FutaSnek> YEA FUCK YOU CHILD
[3:56:55] <%stabbityrabbit> Wow, Mia. That was the dumbest goddamn thing you could've done.
[3:56:57] <+durthknight> why would you transport this monster in a hurricane
[3:56:57] <+SickBangerzM9> french people are funny
[3:56:59] <Zebroneath> Was never a fan of the "Evil Child" horror trope
[3:56:59] <Talfri> The creepy kid part is lame and the bad animation makes it even worse
[3:57:00] <The_Pasta_Paladin> I....liked the scene lol it's cheesy :)
[3:57:02] <%ragingbrachy> the creepy kid shit is so bad everytime evelyn ruins the game
[3:57:02] <aimlesshealer> It is funny
[3:57:03] <+SickBangerzM9> wi wi baguette
[3:57:05] <%Keyd00d> oh...
[3:57:08] <+Tyonidus> It is pretty funny to be fair
[3:57:09] <%Solid_Stro> Before deciding to have children, have your spouse play this game first
[3:57:10] <+possumwalsh1221> The child thing is such a cool concept and the delivery was just “HEHE IM A EVIL”
[3:57:10] <+ConAirOnDVD> that's the weakest jumpscare I think I've ever seen
[3:57:10] <%miabyte> I always thought it was weird that Eveline sounds a little like Susie from Rugrats
[3:57:12] <%etnoika> I only found out recently that this game was written by the writer of F.E.A.R.
[3:57:14] <brambobelurkin> "Ethan! You proved your seeds potency time to shoot your goof juice in Calires vagooner. Look your wifes dead so its technically not cheating"
[3:57:15] <@SoFarFetched> everytime I see the scenes in this,it does feel like an early version of the engine they were using,cause it looks a lot better in the later games.
[3:57:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> French people are funn thats why we watch pat
[3:57:15] <SpaceGuntank> set the language to French and she will LUL
[3:57:16] <%penitentpentwitch> @SomeAsianDood At least they didn't follow the "Bang the Bioweapon" arc of FEAR 2 and 3?
[3:57:18] <dinnydanny777> This is kind of like FEAR
[3:57:20] <SummonerMagno> narrator: it was not funny
[3:57:20] <+moink1234> Mia just fucking say yes then kill the little one
[3:57:21] <$Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I like your french accent pat, it gives us power
[3:57:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> Everything that happened in all the Resident Evils was secretly a ploy for getting first Leon then Ethan to fuck his sister. EVERYTHING
[3:57:32] <%bigboy3d> David Cage corrupted Pat's mind
[3:57:32] <Aydarkzero> @etnoika that makes a lot of sense actually
[3:57:35] <FstSergeant8595> kids are NEVER scary. i dont know why people always use that trope in games and movies
[3:57:39] <brambobelurkin> @BallerSwagBro9k facts
[3:57:40] <Arek_1> @brambobelurkin LUL
[3:57:47] <%miabyte> I keep thinking y'all are talking to me
[3:57:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoFarFetched because this is the first game in the Reach for the Moon Engine
[3:57:48] <heartlesshealer> Wait, RE7 was written by the person behind F.E.A.R.?
[3:57:54] <Talfri> Polar Express?
[3:57:59] <%ragingbrachy> kids are fucking disgusting
[3:58:00] <dinnydanny777> There are some movies with some scary kids
[3:58:00] <SomeAsianDood> @penitentpentwitch according to leaks for the plot of re8. hmmm
[3:58:01] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like you can just punch them
[3:58:01] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[3:58:02] <BluBox> Punt child
[3:58:03] <Ner234> PAT NO
[3:58:07] <+GuardMeShielder> Then you go to jail tho...
[3:58:08] <%TheGreatSkenardo> they are tiny immoral narcissists
[3:58:09] <aimlesshealer> LUL
[3:58:10] <+StrawberryPantsu> UNSETTLING NOT SCARY
[3:58:11] <%DappercatEsquire> GOT'EM
[3:58:11] <+SickBangerzM9> most people arent you pat, we dont punch kids easily
[3:58:11] <%republicofu> yes
[3:58:12] <%toastybites> Pat is all talk
[3:58:12] <%weissguard> PISS OFF, GHOST!
[3:58:13] <$Dakuu75> lol <3
[3:58:13] <Zebroneath> Take that, child
[3:58:13] <%Maids4lyfe> just punch all the children
[3:58:15] <ha2ken> No..the kid became an angel
[3:58:15] <%mikessdd> yeah admittedly if i was contronted with a legit tropy evil kid I'd punt them
[3:58:16] <%Maids4lyfe> no exception
[3:58:17] <Divantae> Pat you only think kids aren't scary bc you're on equal footing height wise
[3:58:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> I mean it'd almost be a fair fight too.
[3:58:18] <%asgard147> limesLUL
[3:58:18] <%Dementedpenguin> >_>
[3:58:18] <%Aleate> If you're a ghost then why the fuck can I beat the shit outta ya? psaDab
[3:58:22] <indig0bird> It's hilarious too!
[3:58:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> On account of the height.
[3:58:23] <+kungfauxboi> BARZ
[3:58:24] <+M3djedx> woolieKICKDAD
[3:58:27] <$Dakuu75> clipping that one, man
[3:58:28] <DarknessD42> Heyo!
[3:58:30] <%republicofu> more children should be punched
[3:58:31] <aimlesshealer> I'm not already on eye level with them, it's harder to connect
[3:58:32] <dinnydanny777> Kids are scary, because they have yet to acquire morality
[3:58:34] <%mikessdd> drop kicking ghost kids
[3:58:35] <rytisone> Ain't afraid of no ghosts
[3:58:36] <brambobelurkin> Children are the least intimidating enemy
[3:58:38] <%etnoika> @BallerSwagBro9k Have you seen those Chrisposting parodies of the One Piece themes with Chris asking Leon and Ethan to fuck his sister
[3:58:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like bitch youre not scary with a busted nose you little shit
[3:58:39] <DrDenorax> I just got here, we punching kids now?
[3:58:42] <%penitentpentwitch> @SomeAsianDood The motif DOES seem to be 'parenthood' for RE8. Especially because the female villain looks like she's wearing a modified maternity dress.
[3:58:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you know the RE engine isn't for Resident evil but for "Reach for the moon Engine"
[3:58:45] <BallerSwagBro9k> @brambobelurkin Wesker found out so he tried to stop Chris but failed.
[3:58:51] <+skylerpilot> Remember, if you're ever bored just got punch an orphan. What are they going to do? tell their parents?
[3:58:52] <+SickBangerzM9> i dont regularly punch children, pat. my first option when dealing with kids isnt violence
[3:58:53] <%Keaton_x> "Piss off, ghost!"
[3:58:54] <jorniev> THAT LITTLE GIRLS IS AWFULL
[3:58:55] <%mikessdd> giving the ghost children the german suplex
[3:59:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @mikessdd I would pay actual money for Pat to dropkick someone.
[3:59:05] <ToneBacas> it's the deep south, Pat
[3:59:07] <%bevyrage> psaBlind
[3:59:08] <%GeneralSCPatton> @mikessdd Equip the child as an improvised weapon and resolve to defeat the nearest windmill like Don Quixote.
[3:59:09] <%FutaSnek> I mean it was eventually by Blue UmbrELLA
[3:59:14] <%TheGreatSkenardo> why is there no furniture on the deck
[3:59:16] <%Maids4lyfe> it's in Louisiana
[3:59:18] <rytisone> how do computers still work here, the generator must be magic
[3:59:19] <Arek_1> @skylerpilot LUL
[3:59:20] <SomeAsianDood> @penitentpentwitch not to mention the main symbol of the cult seems to have a malformed PT fetus
[3:59:21] <%twistingt0rt0ise> The hurricane?
[3:59:25] <%Maids4lyfe> satellites are not around
[3:59:28] <jacksawjack> Or Star Child
[3:59:29] <%ragingbrachy> hes right to say it
[3:59:29] <brambobelurkin> @BallerSwagBro9k Wesker was jealous Chris did not think he was an acceptable sperm donor to continue the Redfield line.
[3:59:29] <dinnydanny777> But they can control your mind Pat
[3:59:34] <heartlesshealer> Paige would break her hand
[3:59:34] <Talfri> I think the creepy kid can work but it was done poorly in this game
[3:59:35] <%AzureGale> Look out, we got a badass over here
[3:59:36] <%ScottishMadJacko> Paige would eat her
[3:59:37] <@SoFarFetched> no she would murder Evie
[3:59:37] <indig0bird> I just realized this boat makes this entire game make absolutely no sense
[3:59:38] <StebTheVee> I give her a hug
[3:59:38] <%penitentpentwitch> Falcon Kick!
[3:59:39] <heartlesshealer> and get infected
[3:59:39] <gade177> lol
[3:59:41] <spacecatstreams> it pat
[3:59:41] <%FutaSnek> NAH U HIT EM WITH G's DEADLY COMBINATION FROM 3rd STRIKE
[3:59:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SickBangerzM9 violence isn't the first option but it can be
[3:59:41] <DrDenorax> OH, we're talkingh about the Resident Evil 7 child.
[3:59:41] <LordOfThePoultry> LUL

[4:02:28] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[4:02:28] <dinnydanny777> I once read that Brazil once had a day where they had spider rain
[4:02:30] <+SickBangerzM9> australia itself is more dangerous than covid

[4:02:31] <%ScottishMadJacko> Dude those spiders give no fucks
[4:02:32] <%cellularmishap> there are spiders everywhere
[4:02:32] <rytisone> the wildlife will consume you there
[4:02:33] <$Dakuu75> "I wanna go to Australia but... without actually going to Australia."
[4:02:33] <brambobelurkin> pat would have to man fight spiders half his size in Aussie
[4:02:34] <heartlesshealer> their webs cover the entire landscape when the spiders are in season
[4:02:36] <TrollKing96> They have spiders that can kill snakes.

[4:02:43] <%ScottishMadJacko> The people give less fucks though
[4:02:43] <heartlesshealer> there are real pictures
[4:02:51] <jacksawjack> Pat, you're so small a Huntsman Spider would probably run off with you.
[4:02:53] <indig0bird> And whenever she goes full Oshtralian I tease her
[4:02:55] <%asgard147> limesS
[4:02:56] <+durthknight> so the mold is a salad
[4:02:57] <+SickBangerzM9> pat do the stabbing animation in front of mias shadow
[4:02:57] <dinnydanny777> @heartlesshealer To be fair I've seen that in England and it's caused by catterpillars
[4:03:00] <+SickBangerzM9> look how bad it is
[4:03:01] <%Solid_Stro> WAP shotoClassy
[4:03:02] <%GeneralSCPatton> If only she had a GPS beacon inside her
[4:03:03] <%SaiyanShoto> Pat will end up fist fighting a spider in Australia
[4:03:07] <$Vineslop_Tod> Yeah, Australia has spider storms, so fuck that place.
[4:03:10] <%TheGreatSkenardo> I keep imaging Mia Faye every time the name is mentioned
[4:03:11] <%vibe__lord> Make sure to convert your money into Dollarydoos
[4:03:16] <ToneBacas> man, New Zealand is having a blast at it. good job on having zero corona infections
[4:03:18] <dinnydanny777> @heartlesshealer That's not an Australia exclusive thing necessarily is all
[4:03:20] <heartlesshealer> @dinnydanny777 at least caterpillars are less bitey
[4:03:22] <aimlesshealer> Pat will become a drop bear
[4:03:25] <%nimu290> where the monster go?
[4:03:26] <%TheGreatSkenardo> SHE would know what to do about psychic little shits
[4:03:29] <brambobelurkin> Chat we have to remember chat an Aussie Spider compared to pat is at least half his size. The threats scale differently at Pats height
[4:03:30] <%asgard147> where gun?
[4:03:35] <%mikessdd> Gotta admit opening twitter and seeing people going so yeah all my shit will probably burn down is fucking terrifying
[4:03:50] <+BubbaRands> Paige, Is mold considered a salad or a garnish?
[4:03:51] <SomeAsianDood> Manly screams

[4:04:48] <%bigboy3d> Mold is my jam
[4:04:49] <$Dakuu75> french is a very comical language
[4:04:50] <Meltgar> Paige should buy the mustard soda Max and crew drank streams ago
[4:04:52] <%FutaSnek> LUL
[4:04:53] <%TheGreatSkenardo> It's because you had to deal with the Quebec government recently

[4:06:12] <Mr_Strut> behind you
[4:06:16] <dinnydanny777> If a Goliath Bird Eating Spider, the largest spider on Earth can supposedly grow to the size of an entire dinner platter, how large is that spider when compared to Pat
[4:06:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did the compressor break again or was it something new?
[4:06:18] <%Solid_Stro> psaGief doodbenny

[4:13:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> like 2
[4:13:49] <%SoySocks> i can't take the molded seriously given their stupid groans
[4:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @penitentpentwitch "Not to mention the blatant disreguard for the conservation of energy"
[4:14:01] <dinnydanny777> Oh I guess one city was space lasered instead of Nuked

[4:15:13] <%happyface699> @scottishmadjacko Wesker
[4:15:21] <SomeAsianDood> Eveline did @ScottishMadJacko Kappa
[4:15:25] <StebTheVee> what gun is that?
[4:15:25] <%Plankman> okay that magazine is kinda stupid
[4:15:27] <%happyface699> It was all wesker
[4:15:29] <dinnydanny777> Didn't Terragrigia get laser beamed
[4:15:42] <%BoneofMalkav> Your right, I can't see psaBlind
[4:15:49] <SomeAsianDood> It's always been wesker?
[4:15:51] <%ScottishMadJacko> "CHRIIISS, I will kill mia first cause fuck you"
[4:15:56] <heartlesshealer> solar beamed
[4:15:57] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if Wesker came back in 7
[4:15:59] <dinnydanny777> 8*
[4:16:02] <StebTheVee> what gun has a magazine like that?
[4:16:03] <%happyface699> @someasiandood Always has been
[4:16:10] <+AlexGrahamBell> this is like first stream of pat's i have tuned into that has no webcam
[4:16:13] <%ScottishMadJacko> I would love wesker being back
[4:16:16] <%Plankman> it's like a pp-bizon
[4:16:20] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat just got to the raktika Greenwood, I'm making good progress!
[4:16:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> Imagine if he mind controlled chris like he did jill
[4:16:27] <%happyface699> I miss wesker
[4:16:28] <aimlesshealer> Is there a horror game that takes place in a really clean environment?
[4:16:30] <%Plankman> Wesker is back and it's NOT addressed how
[4:16:39] <%happyface699> Bring him back in the most nonsense wat
[4:16:43] <%happyface699> Way
[4:16:45] <%ScottishMadJacko> And we have to rip the thing off his pecs
[4:16:46] <+NitronStreams> what if wesker came back as a head in a jar
[4:16:47] <%Plankman> Pat activated his ultra instinct to dodge that one
[4:16:51] <%mikessdd> wesker should never die
[4:16:52] <jorniev> the cooler wesker
[4:16:52] <%Skelegroove> Wesker would be easy to bring back. Monsters have survived worse than lava and rockets
[4:16:54] <%Garthunox> @aimlesshealer Dead Rising 1 and 2
[4:17:00] <%mikessdd> wesker forever
[4:17:00] <SpaceGuntank> i just noticed something, this decrepit ship has awfully fancy pristine wooden doors.
[4:17:03] <dinnydanny777> I want the explanation to be that Wesker facetanked a volcano
[4:17:10] <+MeatBomb> Got a little on the rug there.
[4:17:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> I mean weskers head was fucking destroyed
[4:17:17] <%Plankman> wesker is back but re1 human wesker, it turns out the wesker in most of the series was a clone
[4:17:25] <SomeAsianDood> Make Wesker come back via chakra moon aliens
[4:17:26] <%happyface699> Guys dont forget we shot off parts of wesker in re 5 they could use to recreate him
[4:17:27] <%penitentpentwitch> Ah right, this puzzle
[4:17:30] <%Plankman> but it also turns out human wesker has superpowers
[4:17:35] <Arek_1> @SpaceGuntank LUL
[4:17:38] <rytisone> who designed this?
[4:17:39] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh that's easy, just explain Wesker like he's a Jojo villain, because that's what he is. LUL
[4:17:42] <%ScottishMadJacko> HE ate a rocket to the face before it exploded
[4:17:48] <+SickBangerzM9> """"puzzle"""
[4:17:54] <jorniev> make wesker come back via shaman king
[4:17:54] <%happyface699> Hes like kars
[4:17:56] <%nimu290> is re7 just gonna be the dunk on peach game?
[4:17:57] <%toastybites> what a dumb safe
[4:18:01] <%Plankman> wh
[4:18:04] <%ScottishMadJacko> They could just say that wesker in 5 was a clone
[4:18:11] <%mikessdd> Yep. Wesker was actually found later in a lava proof coffin by lava fishermen
[4:18:12] <%cowardlord> lame
[4:18:13] <+MeatBomb> I love dumb contrivances.
[4:18:14] <%Plankman> why would you set up a safe like that and also have the combination in the same room!
[4:18:14] <%happyface699> @scottishmadjacko Exactly
[4:18:15] <%bevyrage> @nimu290 every game is a dunk-off challenge
[4:18:19] <%penitentpentwitch> Unlimited Wesker Works
[4:18:20] <fairore> I really I hope they follow through rev 2
[4:18:20] <$Dakuu75> what a difficult puzzle, especially when you can see the "puzzle wires" going from the painting to the safe
[4:18:24] <Aydarkzero> god thats dumb @ScottishMadJacko
[4:18:29] <+OK__Gamer> sir what would you like the code to the safe to be?.... "painting"
[4:18:32] <%happyface699> @mikessdd Now its open????

[4:20:34] <%Plankman> wish you could just eat them off the table
[4:20:34] <%Psyramics> How did I get to be 30-someodd years only and not know how to breathe right?

[4:20:54] <%happyface699> Space lives in you
[4:20:54] <%Plankman> and ethan gets super speed and super strength in re8
[4:20:55] <%penitentpentwitch> The Best Kind of Dumb
[4:20:56] <%Agami23> maybe a prototype of the other clones?
[4:20:57] <%cowardlord> @sickbangerzm9 did you live?
[4:20:59] <%SoySocks> @bromeme what if Ethan was a Wesker clone
[4:20:59] <%marsantas> It would be so RE
[4:20:59] <xxmagonx> YES
[4:21:01] <jorniev> REALLY!?
[4:21:03] <BallerSwagBro9k> THAT'D BE SICK
[4:21:03] <%ClericOfSparda> Terrible in all the right ways
[4:21:04] <%MassConnect> its not choking, it's drowing but not
[4:21:04] <dinnydanny777> What if he was Wesker's son?
[4:21:05] <%happyface699> I WOULD LOVE THAT
[4:21:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @bromeme "What if ethan was a clone of wesker"
[4:21:08] <ToneBacas> hmm sure
[4:21:09] <+SickBangerzM9> @cowardlord yea i got over it
[4:21:11] <%ScottishMadJacko> Hes blonde, kind of a badass
[4:21:12] <%emperordread> Ethan's DLC would totally be called: Sins of the Father
[4:21:13] <Aydarkzero> OMG
[4:21:14] <heartlesshealer> oh man
[4:21:17] <trianglehat> I'm ethan and I have a dream
[4:21:17] <%marsantas> He could be that RE6 kids brother!
[4:21:17] <KaiserMario> Isn't that Jake?
[4:21:20] <%nimu290> that would suck
[4:21:20] <+bromeme> That’s so dumb it’s awesome
[4:21:20] <%ScottishMadJacko> No shades yet
[4:21:20] <%Plankman> Doesn't wesker ALREADY have a son??
[4:21:22] <+MeatBomb> Isn't everyone a Wesker? Deep down?
[4:21:22] <%doc_ock_rokc> @dinnydanny777 another Wesker bastard?
[4:21:27] <UltimateDomon> THAT HAPPENED ALREADY THOUGH
[4:21:27] <%stabbityrabbit> It's the type of trashy plot twist that is actually enjoyable.
[4:21:29] <%trllly> There has to be a reason as to why weve never seen his face
[4:21:29] <heartlesshealer> Yeah we have Jake
[4:21:30] <%ScottishMadJacko> But he does use the albert at the end
[4:21:31] <BallerSwagBro9k> Wasnt Alex Giorno?
[4:21:32] <ToneBacas> so Ethan gets to be a gang-star?
[4:21:32] <+Brighthawk> what about a clone of Pat
[4:21:34] <%nimu290> jake exist already
[4:21:36] <%Maids4lyfe> I thought Jake was the Giorno to Wesker's Dio? @PatStaresAt
[4:21:36] <%happyface699> @meatbomb Always have been
[4:21:37] <Aydarkzero> what if Jake just changed his name to Ethan
[4:21:37] <Drusain> Bring back the dumb spy story from Rev1
[4:21:37] <KaiserMario> Jake is Giorno, really
[4:21:38] <+cocoapupstudios> psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG psaPorgmo_SG
[4:21:39] <+SickBangerzM9> ethan is becoming a meme and i love it
[4:21:40] <gamezerox> That's the joke
[4:21:42] <Divantae> Wesker is in all of us
[4:21:44] <%bigboy3d> and you,d just get a mini-teleport as a game mechanic
[4:21:44] <BallerSwagBro9k> I mean Jake sry
[4:21:46] <heartlesshealer> we have Jake and Agent Birkin as his Bruno
[4:21:48] <%WhereIsWill> we'll NEVER see jake again LUL
[4:21:54] <%ScottishMadJacko> God why did i come up with that, capcom would make it way dumber and lamer
[4:21:54] <%Plankman> Chris you gotta hurry up and get clair fucked! The Wesker bloodline outnumbers the redfield bloodline!
[4:21:56] <SomeAsianDood> Jake who? Kappa
[4:21:56] <%Dementedpenguin> Who?
[4:22:00] <%Dementedpenguin> Oh Kappa
[4:22:01] <%Agami23> jakes not a clone, he is a son
[4:22:01] <Aydarkzero> @nimu290 so does Damian but that doesn't stop Dick from being Batmans actual Son
[4:22:03] <karlitasunrise> So far this stream has been the highlight of my day
[4:22:03] <Divantae> Ethan can be better Jake
[4:22:04] <%happyface699> Jake is dead
[4:22:06] <%mikessdd> wasted many many bullets
[4:22:15] <%happyface699> He died once re 6 rolled credits
[4:22:15] <xxshadowxx416> I what jake back
[4:22:17] <%king_wragles> Oh, almost at the end?
[4:22:20] <KaiserMario> Jake Muller
[4:22:21] <+SickBangerzM9> does ethan have character traits?
[4:22:21] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> less bullets=more space Kappa
[4:22:23] <jorniev> in r8 he is probably still a carrier of this virus
[4:22:25] <karlitasunrise> how is jake dead?
[4:22:26] <%king_wragles> No wait, this is the Zoe DLC right?
[4:22:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> What about the chamber's bloodline?
[4:22:27] <+SickBangerzM9> or is he a generic protag?
[4:22:28] <$Dakuu75> itchy-moldy
[4:22:31] <heartlesshealer> Jake is in Edonia or whatever
[4:22:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like no wonder chris wants ethan to continue the bloodline, gotta mix the wesker and redfield bloodlines eh?
[4:22:43] <%Dementedpenguin> I rather they bring back Sheva over Jake, goddammit
[4:22:43] <%happyface699> Ethan is pretty generic
[4:22:55] <Divantae> @king_wragles ship section w/ Mia
[4:23:01] <dalishprince> god i miss sheva
[4:23:01] <%Plankman> i like ethan but he does need some spice to his character
[4:23:02] <karlitasunrise> What about Steve? :P
[4:23:03] <SomeAsianDood> Ethan takes to the situation real fast though
[4:23:05] <+SickBangerzM9> clancy was cooler than ethan
[4:23:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> But what if ethan is generic on purpose eh?
[4:23:15] <SomeAsianDood> Like casually grabbing his severed hand
[4:23:15] <%king_wragles> @Divantae that's right, thanks
[4:23:16] <%happyface699> @karlitasunrise SHHHHHJ
[4:23:25] <+bromeme> Ethan actually a clone of all the recessive genes of the presidents daughter from RE4
[4:23:30] <%happyface699> I want to shoot steves corpse
[4:23:31] <Aydarkzero> yep
[4:23:32] <+StrawberryPantsu> Yep
[4:23:32] <ToneBacas> if the corrosive can burn through metal, how come it doesn't burn through the container?
[4:23:32] <jorniev> can ethan still heal cut of limbs after the end of re 7?
[4:23:33] <%penitentpentwitch> Yup
[4:23:34] <Divantae> he is kinda generic on purpose tho
[4:23:37] <%Psyramics> that's the case for a lot of games
[4:23:38] <%ScottishMadJacko> Im taking the piss btw, as much as id love for ethan to be a wesker or some shit, i highly doubt it
[4:23:38] <karlitasunrise> @happyface699 but seriously what do you mean jake is dead?
[4:23:39] <%SoySocks> any standout exceptions?
[4:23:40] <BluBox> You're not wrong
[4:23:42] <rytisone> true
[4:23:43] <%penitentpentwitch> Starts strong, tapers off
[4:23:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> Except Re4
[4:23:47] <%happyface699> Yep
[4:23:47] <Aydarkzero> Ethan is great
[4:23:50] <+NitronStreams> nothing tops the police station
[4:23:50] <%WhereIsWill> psaBig facts
[4:23:55] <xxshadowxx416> not re6
[4:23:57] <+SickBangerzM9> that still doesnt forgive re7. they should learn from their mistakkkes
[4:23:58] <MayShip> it's hard for me to care about Ethan
[4:24:00] <$Dakuu75> agreed but the RE2 remake was strong at the end
[4:24:01] <+SickBangerzM9> mistakes
[4:24:02] <+MeatBomb> Start strong, then give the audience a piddle.
[4:24:04] <%marsantas> Lab is always linear as hell
[4:24:06] <%Mr_Pylon> RE2 remake finished pretty well
[4:24:08] <%mikessdd> yep. usually the same problems in mosty re's
[4:24:09] <willsin4fun> youre saying the village & castle is better than the island?! Yeah thats true
[4:24:13] <%Garthunox> the re2 and RE3 labs arent that bad
[4:24:15] <%happyface699> @karlitasunrise Not really but i mean re 6 is the only appearance he will have
[4:24:16] <TurtlesAndTentacles> not 5
[4:24:16] <Divantae> I kinda want Ethan to just be a straight up normal guy still in RE8
[4:24:17] <%penitentpentwitch> Hopefully the prologue of RE8 is in a lab to mess with fans
[4:24:18] <jorniev> r4 ?
[4:24:18] <FstSergeant8595> The island in Re4 isnt that bad. I would say every act of that game is equal
[4:24:18] <Talfri> Ethan is like half-insert, half-character, I don't think it worked too well
[4:24:23] <+possumwalsh1221> RE4 castle is the best this is true
[4:24:24] <%miabyte> Wasting points to say RE3make was 15% good, 85% meh.
[4:24:38] <Aydarkzero> ^
[4:24:41] <karlitasunrise> @happyface699 Ohhh I see lol, i thought i missed something in the story
[4:24:43] <%Skelegroove> RE2 Remake lab was good but lacked the length/complexity of the RPD
[4:24:46] <%ScottishMadJacko> Did people not like re3make?
[4:24:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> Island was okay in RE4
[4:24:48] <%happyface699> I hate re 3make
[4:24:49] <Divantae> The problem is that the part of RE3make that is good is the demo
[4:24:53] <+MeatBomb> Who would win in a fight, Pyramid Head or Wesker?
[4:24:53] <%Dementedpenguin> When I reached the castle in RE4 I was like "fucking there's MORE?!"
[4:24:54] <+bromeme> Does that mean there is a perfect resident evil game of just houses and labs
[4:24:54] <%Plankman> wasting points to say Hi Pat give gief a kiss
[4:24:56] <%miabyte> after that intitial opening area I just got so sad
[4:25:01] <%Dementedpenguin> *in a good way
[4:25:01] <Divantae> They really shouldn't have made it the demo lol
[4:25:01] <+ishouldfeelbad> RE3make was hurt by hype
[4:25:01] <%mikessdd> I'm okay with most of 5. I prefer the more industrial parts at the end to the racism swamps
[4:25:07] <rytisone> near the door
[4:25:07] <Goodvibes99508> watch re8 be like oh yeah Ethan is billy's kid
[4:25:09] <%ScottishMadJacko> I thought it was a step down from 2 but still fantastic
[4:25:09] <jorniev> why is ethan even involved in r8?
[4:25:12] <+StrawberryPantsu> I liked 3 make more than 2make
[4:25:13] <+possumwalsh1221> @miabyte Y e s I love RE and never even bought the re3 remake cause watching someone beat it showed everything lol
[4:25:15] <Aydarkzero> @ScottishMadJacko re3r is fine but i hated that i needed to pay $60 for a multiplayer i didn't care about at all
[4:25:17] <Red_Comet_Tyson> they been doing it since sweet home this level desing @PatStaresAt
[4:25:18] <%toolofparanoia> 3MAKE COULD HAVE HAD MORE LOVE PUT INTO IT
[4:25:19] <%Garthunox> @miabyte counterpoint, it was 100% average
[4:25:21] <%trllly> Wasting points to say girfmm
[4:25:22] <brambobelurkin> @ScottishMadJacko Ive seen people split on it love it or hate it game from what Ive seen
[4:25:23] <%Skelegroove> RE3Make is more of an action game and was really short
[4:25:25] <+SickBangerzM9> re4make should never happen
[4:25:30] <%happyface699> @ishouldfeelbad It also was hurt by rushing it out to bank iff re 2
[4:25:32] <karlitasunrise> I was disappointed in RE3 remake
[4:25:38] <+SickBangerzM9> re4 still holds up today
[4:25:39] <%miabyte> @Garthunox The opening area was promising
[4:25:43] <%Garthunox> it was a vessel for resistance
[4:25:44] <%ScottishMadJacko> I loved the multiplayer
[4:25:44] <%bendatron> excluding cvx of ourse
[4:25:45] <+NoirePanzer> RE3 always getting shafted
[4:25:46] <+StrawberryPantsu> *ReM4ke
[4:25:47] <+SickBangerzM9> they wont be able to capture re4's charm
[4:25:48] <%Aleate> ReM4ke
[4:25:50] <%happyface699> I really hated re 3 remake
[4:25:52] <%Plankman> fuck it
[4:25:52] <%Skelegroove> Final Nemesis is also horribly broken on harder difficulties
[4:25:54] <Divantae> I think a lot of RE games would be perfect with just a little more dev time
[4:25:56] <%Plankman> we're skipping to re5make
[4:25:59] <%ScottishMadJacko> I do wish we got more time around jills apartment
[4:25:59] <Aydarkzero> Jill never got a good game after RE1
[4:25:59] <StebTheVee> Why remake the game that inspired you to remake the old games using the remake's gameplay?
[4:26:01] <%Garthunox> @miabyte yeah true
[4:26:01] <karlitasunrise> I love the gritty atmosphere in 4
[4:26:02] <rytisone> I'd rather want CV to be remade
[4:26:03] <%SoySocks> what would need to be changed in cvx to make a remake worth it?
[4:26:04] <Divantae> or budget more like
[4:26:05] <fairore> @sickbangerzm9 charm LUL
[4:26:05] <jorniev> RE4MAKE
[4:26:06] <%ClutchRoadagain> I will never get over 3's remake getting shafted.
[4:26:07] <%Plankman> RE2make 2
[4:26:09] <%trllly> I cant say i was disappointed in RE3make because i never played the original.
[4:26:10] <%ScottishMadJacko> maybe a bit more time with pursuer nemesis
[4:26:12] <xanderfist> damn your already to the ship
[4:26:19] <+ConAirOnDVD> god there absolutely just does not need to be a remake of 4
[4:26:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> Why does the RE2make feel more like RE3 then RE3make?
[4:26:36] <+SickBangerzM9> @fairore you know its true. re4 had something special
[4:26:36] <%ScottishMadJacko> Im excited re4make though
[4:26:39] <+StrawberryPantsu> RE:Make,RE2Make,R3Make,REM4ke
[4:26:40] <%Skelegroove> RE3make is much worse when directly compared to RE2make
[4:26:41] <%trllly> Really they could release a clocktower DLC if they wanted
[4:26:41] <%nimu290> lets gooooooo
[4:26:42] <karlitasunrise> Should have played this in MADHOUSE
[4:26:48] <mrcelab> @PatStaresAt Did You watch the Dev update for Re village? The game is about Chriss not Leon. And its about Ethan. The game continues after this game.
[4:26:52] <%ScottishMadJacko> It could be terrible but ill still have the old one to go back to
[4:26:52] <%ragingbrachy> re4 has more re-releases than skyrim doesnt it?
[4:26:54] <%WhereIsWill> SourPls
[4:27:03] <%penitentpentwitch> As long as there are no sphincter doors
[4:27:04] <rcw_official> those alien bastards shot up my riiide
[4:27:05] <stevenellis386> ITS TIME TO KICK ASS AND ....
[4:27:09] <%ragingbrachy> yeah i know
[4:27:10] <RiverBirch> Lets RAWK
[4:27:10] <BallerSwagBro9k> Hail to the king BABY
[4:27:10] <+Meta1spy51> BLOW IT OUT YOUR ASS YOU SLIMY BASTARD
[4:27:13] <%ClutchRoadagain> RE7 pulls off action-horror way better than 5 & 6 do
[4:27:13] <+StooEsq> Oh, it's a Bizon
[4:27:13] <%king_wragles> Bisons are the coolest looking, shitty SMGs
[4:27:19] <%cowardlord> What a hero
[4:27:21] <RiverBirch> It's time to Rock, and Roll Bubblegum blunts
[4:27:22] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like original re4 isnt too dated, to the point where i can happily play the original
[4:27:23] <xanderfist> RE3 Remake is awful compared to original
[4:27:29] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Let's go curbstomb this ghost kid
[4:27:30] <+Estuko> @PatStaresAt PogChamp you duke nukem from that Duke Nukem Forever game? PogChamp
[4:27:31] <RiverBirch> And I'm all outta ROCKS
[4:27:36] <rytisone> blow it out your ass
[4:27:41] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Did you know: Duke Nukem's VA also voiced Big the cat?
[4:27:41] <@SSaryn> Now put a bomb down and remember to aim at the floor Kappa
[4:27:44] <%toolofparanoia> "Hey Caleb, did you here about Doom Guy? He's Got Ligma."
[4:27:47] <fairore> @sickbangerzm9 I haft disagree with you there it just felt like resident evil to me nothing more nothing less
[4:27:51] <+SickBangerzM9> re4 had perfect controls. not being able to move while shooting was never a problem
[4:27:51] <BallerSwagBro9k> "I'm gonna rip your head off and shit down your neck" was a classic LUL
[4:27:55] <%ClutchRoadagain> RE4 is especially not dated due to them remastering it for every generation of consoles
[4:28:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> A fact he will never live down
[4:28:06] <%Plankman> Oh god, it's pudge from dota 2!
[4:28:11] <%Pappajimbo> "I'm here to chew bubble gum and puch little girls and i'm all outta gum"
[4:28:17] <+SickBangerzM9> @fairore "your right hand comes off" "no thanks bro" "wheres everyone going? bingo?"
[4:28:19] <%king_wragles> @SSaryn if Pat gets the plant I'll go double Berretas next round
[4:28:24] <%ScottishMadJacko> That is true, re4 does rerelease more than skyrim
[4:28:25] <Aydarkzero> can't wait to RE4 PS5 edition and RE4R LUL
[4:28:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> Wait was that body sitting there for 3 years and BARELY decomposed?
[4:28:37] <%nimu290> wow lucky
[4:28:42] <+StooEsq> Pat goes on yet another mission to punch a shitkid
[4:28:42] <jorniev> I feel like they still could pull of a Duke nuke em sequel without shooting on Duke... too much
[4:28:44] <%SoySocks> do the coins do something?
[4:28:54] <+SickBangerzM9> give you upgrades
[4:28:55] <RiverBirch> @SoySocks unlocks
[4:28:59] <Aydarkzero> @SoySocks unlock weapons and stat boosters
[4:29:05] <Nickdick96> they open special cages
[4:29:05] <%Savages4Blood> wait... just got here. where's pat
[4:29:06] <%trllly> Did Pat defeat the mind goblins or do they just have no effect on this game?
[4:29:08] <%SoySocks> ah okay. thx
[4:29:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> @SoySocks you can buy upgrades at zoe's cabin
[4:29:09] <SomeAsianDood> Mold's packed with preservatives. Just ask paige Kappa @doc_ock_rokc
[4:29:10] <%WhereIsWill> ethan ate the MOLD
[4:29:13] <%Plankman> ethan wake up!!
[4:29:14] <+SickBangerzM9> this scene is awesome
[4:29:16] <Talfri> I like this scene
[4:29:19] <+Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[4:29:20] <BlkFlameKami> THE MOLD VERSE
[4:29:21] <+SickBangerzM9> doesnt make sense though
[4:29:24] <+Dives__> Daddy fmgLOVE
[4:29:25] <Aydarkzero> this is my favorite part of re7
[4:29:26] <%ragingbrachy> jack BibleThump
[4:29:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> Tbf, ill continue buying re4 every time it releases so i guess im just the gullible consumer they need huh
[4:29:28] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> this is a good scene
[4:29:28] <Divantae> green mold
[4:29:29] <@SSaryn> BibleThump
[4:29:30] <@SoFarFetched> so about Lucas....
[4:29:32] <FstSergeant8595> FeelsBadMan
[4:29:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> You are Ex Marine
[4:29:33] <fairore> this scene is so fucked up
[4:29:34] <TurtlesAndTentacles> LIES
[4:29:34] <bxdragon> Why doesn't Ethan become a crazy mold monster?
[4:29:35] <%penitentpentwitch> The lucas line's a lie
[4:29:36] <IminyourBase> even zoe
[4:29:38] <%Savages4Blood> wait... just got here. where's pat
[4:29:39] <%Plankman> sad...
[4:29:39] <+SickBangerzM9> jack is unaware about lucas though
[4:29:39] <%ScottishMadJacko> I loved this but didnt expect it
[4:29:41] <BallerSwagBro9k> HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
[4:29:41] <%SoySocks> moldmagheddon
[4:29:41] <%ragingbrachy> eveline DansGame
[4:29:41] <+tigerfang86> LUCAS NOT A CREEP HEH
[4:29:41] <xanderfist> Lucas is a psycho
[4:29:42] <dinnydanny777> Why is Zoe not super pissed off with you
[4:29:42] <%bendatron> literally a marine
[4:29:42] <karlitasunrise> Why is Pat's camera off/
[4:29:44] <%ClutchRoadagain> Jack died believing his son was a good dude
[4:29:44] <+not_draven> this makes no fucking sense
[4:29:45] <Divantae> lol Jack puts Zoe below Lucas
[4:29:45] <%Garthunox> best scene in the game
[4:29:46] <jorniev> this part made me feel so sad
[4:29:46] <IminyourBase> the person who tried not murdering you the least
[4:29:48] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> BibleThump
[4:29:52] <dinnydanny777> Shouldn't Zoe be furious with you
[4:29:52] <@SoFarFetched> makes me wonder why Marguerite is not in the scene.
[4:29:56] <iswearimjustdandy> Or even zoe
[4:29:57] <%happyface699> Poor jack
[4:30:00] <%ScottishMadJacko> I wonder why they all treat zoe the same
[4:30:00] <%NDHCemployee> I like this scene but it makes no goddamn sense
[4:30:01] <@SoFarFetched> think it was only him and Zoe
[4:30:03] <%WhereIsWill> out in the BAYOU
[4:30:04] <%ragingbrachy> jack didnt know about lucas FeelsBadMan
[4:30:04] <%Keyd00d> FeelsBadMan
[4:30:07] <%happyface699> Hes just sad
[4:30:08] <Delrugal_> @bxdragon You never know, he could get mold powers in 8
[4:30:09] <%cowardlord> So how did Evelyn get out?
[4:30:12] <jorniev> she turn me in to a BIO MAN
[4:30:12] <BallerSwagBro9k> DO SPIRITS EXIST IN RE NOW?
[4:30:14] <+lordericter> Oh so Jack and Zoe are here because they are the only two left infected fully and not actually dead
[4:30:14] <TurtlesAndTentacles> What is this?
[4:30:18] <Talfri> This is within the Mold and only the people who are alive and infected show up, Marguerite is dead and that is why she isn't there
[4:30:18] <+AmanisHouseOfNonsense> Jack, bro BibleThump
[4:30:19] <+tigerfang86> FeelsBadMan
[4:30:21] <+SickBangerzM9> zoe was an idiot. why did she think ethan wouldnt save mia?
[4:30:23] <fairore> @sofarfetched because she already died I would presume
[4:30:24] <%Keyd00d> Ghost conversation
[4:30:30] <+D00msDayDan> so she takes control
[4:30:32] <stevenellis386> its called mind control sir
[4:30:33] <%reonome> BibleThump
[4:30:33] <+lordericter> so this is the hivemind
[4:30:34] <%ScottishMadJacko> Imagine ethan gets mold powers so moldy wesker
[4:30:34] <$Teh_Un> So how is Ethan not infected?
[4:30:41] <Divantae> Jack's VA is so good he is sad then balls to the walls Tokyo Drift
[4:30:43] <Aydarkzero> Hive Mind time
[4:30:44] <%toolofparanoia> hes in the consciousness man. It's like a hive mind
[4:30:46] <BlkFlameKami> he is
[4:30:48] <jorniev> SHE IS LIKE A HORRIBLE GIRLFRIEND
[4:30:48] <@SoFarFetched> Ethan is infected I believe.
[4:30:48] <%Savages4Blood> wait... just got here. where's pat
[4:30:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Teh_Un he is infected
[4:30:50] <+Walopoh> I love the score in this scene
[4:30:52] <@SoFarFetched> Just not as infected as everyone else.
[4:30:52] <%king_wragles> @Teh_Un plot cells
[4:30:52] <Talfri> Ethan is basically guaranteed to be Molded
[4:30:54] <%ragingbrachy> ethan has the mold
[4:30:54] <pepegrillo3> @sofarfetched she is the only one dead ans lucas cut his connection with eve
[4:30:59] <+SickBangerzM9> unmolded bakers are the nicest people, besides lucas
[4:31:00] <%king_wragles> It's like plot armor, but cells
[4:31:02] <SainEdge> zoe and jack still live, margarete is dead and lucas has been freed from evelins control
[4:31:02] <+Walopoh> The music is perfect
[4:31:06] <%Keyd00d> BibleThump
[4:31:09] <xanderfist> Ethan has the healing powers
[4:31:09] <%WhereIsWill> BibleThump
[4:31:15] <@SoFarFetched> Makes sense f or Marguerite then,which I then wonder how come she didnt keep coming back alive like Jack did.
[4:31:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> Mental thing
[4:31:16] <%Keyd00d> It's a hivemind talk
[4:31:16] <+SickBangerzM9> the molded hivemind
[4:31:19] <+toomuchsnarfsnarf> BibleThump
[4:31:19] <%penitentpentwitch> Mold hivemind
[4:31:20] <%vaporousTippler> They're force ghosts.
[4:31:22] <+Walopoh> I assume it's mentally inside the hivemind @PatStaresAt
[4:31:23] <%marsantas> It's a mental something 100%
[4:31:23] <+MeatBomb> I think it's a brain exchange.
[4:31:24] <rytisone> mold dreamscape
[4:31:25] <%Agami23> i think theres like a hivemind thing
[4:31:27] <%ScottishMadJacko> Maybe its remnants of jack in the mold?
[4:31:28] <circular7> mental something
[4:31:29] <+Dives__> It's mental projection
[4:31:29] <%toolofparanoia> its a mental thing
[4:31:30] <+Reaverund> Its 100% an inexplicable magic ghost bullshit
[4:31:39] <BallerSwagBro9k> IT MAKES NO SENSE
[4:31:39] <Divantae> I think it's like a hivemind thing in the mold considering Zoe and Jack are calcified as well as Ethan
[4:31:41] <%ScottishMadJacko> Oh 100%
[4:31:41] <+Zerodyne90> BibleThump
[4:31:42] <%nimu290> brain power
[4:31:42] <Rellim80> But Jack survives?
[4:31:46] <@SoFarFetched> its also very questionable
[4:31:48] <+SickBangerzM9> theyre married
[4:31:49] <Aydarkzero> i believe it Mia is the worst
[4:31:53] <BallerSwagBro9k> True
[4:31:54] <%sund0wner> Very true
[4:31:54] <%penitentpentwitch> Two spies in a 'marriage'
[4:31:55] <%Maids4lyfe> like Raiden and Rose @PatStaresAt
[4:31:56] <%marsantas> I think there was love up until the chainsaw
[4:31:58] <%Skelegroove> Maybe Evie imprinted on Ethan as well
[4:31:59] <%Savages4Blood> @patstaresat are you ok? no mic has me worried
[4:32:00] <Hellarussian> resident evil? more like smellsident evil haha
[4:32:00] <Delrugal_> I hope his character gets fleshed out more in 8
[4:32:00] <rytisone> just like yours and Paige
[4:32:01] <BlkFlameKami> headcannon pat
[4:32:02] <jorniev> reminds me of the RE4 VILLAGERS
[4:32:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ethan has to be a Blue Umbrella Person
[4:32:05] <+Walopoh> Ethan should want nothing to do with her after this
[4:32:06] <%ScottishMadJacko> Like it makes sense if ethan is a secret agent or some shit and hes watching mia for someone
[4:32:07] <%FutaSnek> SHES RIGHT THERE
[4:32:07] <BallerSwagBro9k> Oh yeah good feeling gone
[4:32:14] <+Dives__> Maybe the sex is incredible so its all worth it
[4:32:15] <%Plankman> what ARE she doing??
[4:32:17] <MissFantasy> its like he knew something
[4:32:17] <%toolofparanoia> BIG SECRETS FOR VILLAGE
[4:32:17] <karlitasunrise> NOOOOOOOO
[4:32:26] <WaywardWarrior7> that's why I choose Zoe
[4:32:27] <+tigerfang86> he's SUPER HIGH
[4:32:31] <%sund0wner> Tripping mold balls indeed
[4:32:34] <%reonome> mmm mold balls
[4:32:35] <%Savages4Blood> @patstaresat are you ok? no mic has me worried
[4:32:35] <%Plankman> ugh
[4:32:37] <dinnydanny777> Why is Mia like "don't follow me" she could have just not made the fucking video and none of this would have happened
[4:32:39] <@SoFarFetched> and his foot back on again
[4:32:40] <+lordericter> and just slap his leg back on
[4:32:40] <%Plankman> that stapled hand wound is NASTY
[4:32:41] <jorniev> ETHAN is probably still carrying the virus in 7
[4:32:41] <+tigerfang86> KILL A MUSHROOM CHILD
[4:32:44] <Aydarkzero> if you picked Zoe you get a boss fight
[4:32:46] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt why does Lucas do this to his family?
[4:32:47] <+sp_abadidea> It just goes to show that once Ethan gets rid of Eveline and Lucas is STILL an asshole that Eveline had NOTHING to do with Lucas being evil
[4:32:51] <%alcors_wisdom> mothballs amiright gamers
[4:32:51] <Divantae> idk tho Eveline gaslights people and is manipulative child
[4:32:51] <$Teh_Un> Imagine if you could play the whole game without your hand
[4:32:52] <%snow_bush> TAKE A BIG WIFE BOY
[4:32:53] <+tigerfang86> you MUST kill mushroom child
[4:32:54] <rytisone> can't Evie also posses Ethan as well and have a possesed family
[4:32:55] <@SSaryn> waow
[4:32:57] <gamezerox> for someone he doesn't love he's reacting oretty hard
[4:32:58] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ethan is dying of staple arm. its the same reason Ash believed in Deadites
[4:32:58] <%Maids4lyfe> lmao
[4:33:02] <%Xevtes> its not the best relationship, but they do care about each other
[4:33:02] <@SSaryn> INTO THE DEPTHS
[4:33:06] <+Estuko> Pat is NE K K ID
[4:33:06] <TyrantSlime> He's nekkid
[4:33:07] <$Teh_Un> Achievement unlocked!
[4:33:08] <%Loinclothiclese> @Dives__ yea she has to be down to do some nasty stuff for ethan to go this far for her LUL
[4:33:10] <SomeAsianDood> Steam acheivos
[4:33:10] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat has his dick out too
[4:33:10] <%Plankman> gross
[4:33:11] <%WhereIsWill> sweaty pat Kreygasm
[4:33:11] <%penitentpentwitch> Pat's pepperoni's must never be on camera
[4:33:12] <%sund0wner> Blast his pepperonis lmao
[4:33:14] <RevolverBobkat> show us
[4:33:15] <karlitasunrise> Pepparonis with fan lol
[4:33:16] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt No fan noise, you're good
[4:33:17] <dinnydanny777> Imagine if Mia never sent Ethan that stupid video, none of this game would have ever happened
[4:33:18] <Divantae> achievement cameo
[4:33:18] <+scrumbotime> Pepperoni Blasters
[4:33:19] <%king_wragles> The fan noise is no where near as bad as the pepperoni noises.
[4:33:20] <%SaiyanShoto> No camera just means Pats meat is out
[4:33:20] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 Ethan actually never sees the video Mia made, he only gets an email telling him to go get her
[4:33:21] <%walternatorz> pat is communicating through potato salad mold hivemind
[4:33:21] <Hellarussian> we can hear your pepperonis flapping
[4:33:22] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is airing out of his balls
[4:33:23] <rcw_official> big pepperoni blasting going on here
[4:33:23] <+tigerfang86> Naked Pat..... the master of stealth
[4:33:26] <%Maids4lyfe> so Ethan is probably a super soldier
[4:33:28] <%Savages4Blood> @patstaresat totally meant cam lol I'm dumb
[4:33:29] <%sund0wner> Zero visual evidence Pat innocent
[4:33:30] <BlkFlameKami> I CAN HEAR YOUR DICK PAT
[4:33:30] <%nimu290> pat is airing out the orb
[4:33:30] <Delrugal_> Oh that's what that is. I thought it was ambient noise
[4:33:32] <%emperordread> That's the half truth
[4:33:34] <%WhereIsWill> cannot confirm nor deny chat
[4:33:35] <%ScottishMadJacko> Mia has that WAP apparently
[4:33:35] <%alcors_wisdom> "if you
[4:33:36] <KeystoneA2> Just don't pull a DSP and forget the camera is on.
[4:33:37] <Nickdick96> pepperonni os salami?

[4:33:42] <dinnydanny777> @talfri Is the email from Mia though?
[4:33:43] <+D00msDayDan> what a mansion
[4:33:44] <+StrawberryPantsu> @PatStaresAt What if Puppy bites dick?
[4:33:44] <RC_S3kshun8> @PatStaresAt I'm more concerned you said 'pepperoniS' plural. As in you have multiple dicks.
[4:33:45] <LordOfThePoultry> wheres the gators?
[4:33:45] <rytisone> the dog will bite it
[4:33:48] <aimlesshealer> Not clear to us or you?

[4:34:00] <Divantae> LUL
[4:34:00] <KaiserMario> His dick isn't out, cause his dog will eat his penis
[4:34:00] <jorniev> pat is probably SPREAD EAGLE iNG
[4:34:01] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> out of all the games you could play nude resident evil is probably on the weirder side
[4:34:01] <+tigerfang86> HES SUPER NAKED

[4:34:12] <+mecharocky> Oh God, it's the Louis C.K. incident all over again
[4:34:12] <+OwlLightningMage> Elmo plugged the camera back in
[4:34:13] <SainEdge> @dinnydanny777 ethan never saw the video, he only got the fake email from controled mia/evilin
[4:34:13] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 she didn't want him to come get her, so I'm sure it was Eveline's doing
[4:34:14] <%alcors_wisdom> "if you or anyone else thinks it may not be appropriate to take your dick out... dont take your dick out" -pat 2020
[4:34:17] <+RalvrWuff> Breeze with a fan is amazing

[4:35:18] <Talfri> @dinnydanny777 yeah Eveline sent him the email to lure him over as a new victim
[4:35:20] <dinnydanny777> @talfri But it's so weird to make a video for someone being like "don't follow me" if they had no reason to do that in the first place
[4:35:20] <+lordericter> gonna buy some roids?

[4:36:13] <KaiserMario> Wrong knife
[4:36:14] <%alcors_wisdom> you know its kinda weird now that i think about it that youre "recording" your progress on a tape deck around the same time ada is running around with a magic cube phone
[4:36:17] <%Xevtes> @theredfox930000 champions of the digital world
[4:36:17] <%ScottishMadJacko> Which pistol is strongest?

[4:37:58] <Talfri> @nipplestheenchilada96 he had his hand chainsawed off and someone else stapled it back on
[4:37:59] <heartlesshealer> nice
