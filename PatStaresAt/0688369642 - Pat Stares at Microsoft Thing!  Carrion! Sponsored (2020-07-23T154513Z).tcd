[0:23:09] <+CptBritches> @PatStaresAt Making original, cool content isn't 343's specialty
[0:23:10] <%FortNothing> the shooting seems a little impotent
[0:23:10] <regnier86> the shield recharge so fast wtf
[0:23:10] <HeroSolaire> it looks like a Xbox 360 game

[0:23:27] <+ithonmage> but can you crouch
[0:23:27] <%BigLoserJosh> thats kinda neat
[0:23:28] <1matheuw> why is everyone has grapple hooks now?
[0:23:29] <%DrTomT18> pat, there is too much to explain in one message
[0:23:29] <+KilogramHours> PATHFINDER
[0:23:29] <Tonicky > When will our old buddy John Arbiter again?
[0:23:29] <+FackinCrazy> After playing doom its weird not seeing enemies explode into guts when they die
[0:23:30] <LorcaNomad> Why do the covenant speak english?
[0:23:30] <Tennochief> the weapoms are too blocky
[0:23:30] <%DothMyNugsBequeathMe> is this borderlands
[0:23:30] <Arnschen> Ooooh

[0:23:34] <+BaybeeBat> cool is this the whole showcase then
[0:23:34] <ethanjbennett> a poor mans rip and tear
[0:23:35] <bruno_silv0> kinda sad that halo is just destiny but with worse shooting
[0:23:35] <Coystick> Apple Hook!
[0:23:36] <%takutoots> is tht a nerf gun
[0:23:37] <MyNameIsRasus> Woolie just nutted
[0:23:37] <JonnyCue> Pat stares at Woolie playing John Halo?
[0:23:38] <%InugamiTheHound> its from halo 3
[0:23:39] <%holydeviant1> I kinda like the grapple
[0:23:39] <+lanik745> pat doesn't see anything negative on screen so has to find something to hate
[0:23:40] <%moogleboy1984> *Woolie has entered the chat*
[0:23:41] <watts121> Ghost of Tsushima feels like a game from next gen
[0:23:41] <+rheviel> look nice to me
[0:23:42] <+GingerStrawhat> Brute Pistonl is always nice
[0:23:43] <AFlyingTaco1> How is this gonna work in MP though?
[0:23:43] <Hydrapissed> also there is like 5555 guys in front of him not hitting him
[0:23:43] <%derekwst3> grapple is cool, but enough of the game, unless we are showing something new
[0:23:44] <DE777ON> they changed the brute shotgun
[0:23:44] <%CaptainPileDriver> this looks pretty decent
[0:23:44] <TallPixels> this series really hasn't evolved in decades?
[0:23:44] <%Combatrobot423> Grappling hook? I can't believe this is a Sekiro ripoff.
[0:23:45] <Hydrapissed> this looks weird
[0:23:45] <Stewbedale> Woolies in
[0:23:46] <venomfury86> 2021 YEAR OF THE GRAPPLING HOOK
[0:23:47] <rufus2k2> y'know this reminds me of jak and daxter 2 for some reason
[0:23:47] <%CaptainPileDriver> not gonna lie
[0:23:48] <%a_delicious_cake> 1st time watching live, and I forgot that I can't skip the boring parts.
[0:23:48] <+dashdodger> ok we get it already
[0:23:48] <maznuts> @PatStaresAt Cant wait for that sneaky DMC5 SE announcement
[0:23:48] <Solidnick18> woolieSPICE woolieSPICE woolieSPICE
[0:23:49] <%trllly> Theres a lot of mechanics im seeing here that i really like
[0:23:49] <1matheuw> this, doom eternal and shadow warrior 3 all have Grapple hookers
[0:23:49] <%ergheisu> IT'S HALO OR NOTHING
[0:23:49] <GearVoltron> I cant wait till they make halo andromeda
[0:23:50] <OneThousandTomatoes> grapple hook is the best thing so far
[0:23:50] <+GingerStrawhat> fuck I'm tired
[0:23:51] <grumpiestchris> man destiny 4 looks lit
[0:23:55] <nepwar> man look at that not halo 2 level AI
[0:23:57] <kragavash> so its just borderlands now
[0:23:58] <DelgotHansto> Reminds me of Dying Lights grapple a bit in the animation too bad that's never coming out
[0:23:58] <ThatGuyThere03> WHAT THE FUCK DID THEY DO TO THE SHOTGUN
[0:23:59] <+FlubbedPig> Aw damn it, is that what the Shotgun looks like again?
[0:23:59] <+Promessa_EX> Mauler but not
[0:23:59] <%dropthebehelit> This looks like the game I played 20yrs ago but with a grappling hook
[0:23:59] <Solidnick18> woolieGASM woolieGASM woolieGASM
[0:24:01] <fatalDestiny> Everything looks/sounds like it lacks any impact, it's weirdly muted for Halo.
[0:24:02] <nepwar> just standing right in the open
[0:24:04] <greypipe> When you wonder why construction takes so long, it’s cause of guys like me watching Pat. Game looks great.
[0:24:05] <%RedoctoberWolf> look at all that woolie bait
[0:24:05] <Hydrapissed> shotgun sounds pathetic to
[0:24:05] <+KilogramHours> I LIKE THAT
[0:24:06] <+Ancopro> wait when did elites not become friend
[0:24:06] <generalquackers> grappling hook in *current year*
[0:24:07] <%evilaltruistic> It looks cool. I'm down .
[0:24:07] <regnier86> hp and life regen LUL
[0:24:08] <rufus2k2> hook too slow
[0:24:09] <Sporkgasm> idk something about this doesn't look great to me but i can't figure out what
[0:24:10] <+Troispoint> The gunplay looks good at least
[0:24:11] <vingadivo> god im so fucki g bored
[0:24:11] <DE777ON> lol literally doom
[0:24:12] <%holydeviant1> "Pat has to find something to hate" Instantly: "I like that gun~"
[0:24:12] <+KilogramHours> I LIKE HOOK
[0:24:14] <1matheuw> can you hear woolies (yeyeyeye)?
[0:24:14] <%CaptainPileDriver> like, who cares if it's open world as long as i can just have fun killing enemies and going pew
[0:24:15] <NewWillinium> . .Was that a goddamn Grappling hookshot?
[0:24:17] <VizualBlitz> multiplayer looks like it would be sick
[0:24:17] <%Selendri_> These gun noises are weak
[0:24:17] <DE777ON> doom grapple
[0:24:18] <+average_support156> so its just doom
[0:24:19] <%PlasticJake> damn woolie's gonna fuckin love this 😂
[0:24:19] <Glass_Muffin> this looks like they took notes from doom @PatStaresAt
[0:24:19] <%Ixiah> ResidentSleeper
[0:24:19] <%SilverDevilfish> Wow that was like Doom's hook but more lame
[0:24:20] <%Solareon_> Solareon_ subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months! What do you think John Halo’s middle name is? I think it’s Halo.
[0:24:20] <+FlubbedPig> The gun sound design is REALLY lacking
[0:24:20] <LORDSPOOKLEKINS> slow grapple booooo
[0:24:21] <rufus2k2> is that a piano?
[0:24:21] <%ToneBacas> rip and tear, John Halo
[0:24:22] <%Kirkenburger> Kirkenburger subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Pat, your my favorite example of being half right but well meaning. Keep being a slightly better DSP.
[0:24:23] <smellytooth> can bungie sue itself for copying it's own game?
[0:24:23] <BallerSwagBro9k> Watch this be the ONLY good part of the showcase. Fully front loaded LUL
[0:24:23] <%barrakuta371> Nobody tell Woolie about the grapple
[0:24:24] <+ryderbootz> This game looks like a megablocks set
[0:24:24] <%ergheisu> the guns actually don't feel good so far
[0:24:25] <%evilaltruistic> !uptime
[0:24:25] <+gustavozxd> looks fun
[0:24:25] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 24m 34s.
[0:24:26] <%AdamElJefe> At least they got someone who knows how to play the game to do the demo
[0:24:26] <skewerstar> is that a shitty? it sounds so flaccid...
[0:24:26] <+Promessa_EX> I’m happy it looks like classic halo
[0:24:27] <%Comtrya> slow doom

[0:27:06] <Dean_Inbetween> Pat you litterally have no context for anything
[0:27:06] <%SGrim> When's the PC port?
[0:27:07] <$thesickestzak> NO PAIGE! Don't be happy for anything! nliAhhh
[0:27:07] <JaceDarkstar> people haven't been happy with halo for a while
[0:27:08] <bigbrothergannon> its a mid west thing
[0:27:08] <+Orenfel> per pixel bro

[0:27:12] <+SmokerWest> IT'S GONNA BE ON STEAM
[0:27:12] <Prevot> he is
[0:27:12] <generalquackers> complex visual effects look like melty plastic
[0:27:12] <Retinolgaming> Minecraft?
[0:27:12] <%Typhaeon> 343 more like 38 Studios
[0:27:13] <boardscanada> they're really stuck in the '00s aren't they?
[0:27:13] <%evilaltruistic> Someone has to be positive. It definitely can't be Chat and its permavirgin vibes.
[0:27:14] <henshinstronger6> That vista doesn't look epic
[0:27:14] <dietmouintainmadewka> I thought the Covenant was gone what happened
[0:27:14] <+AbnormalVoid> stop being positive paige geez
[0:27:15] <+arabundo> halo 5’s story was a wet fart
[0:27:16] <%erohoney> complex. with tall pillars with no texture
[0:27:17] <+shapeforn> It looks fine, not particularly exciting tho
[0:27:17] <%SashaStarshine> How about split screen huh?
[0:27:18] <ttc_lover> Has Halo been bad since bungie left? Feels like it
[0:27:19] <%maenos2> epic visions but had clouds pop in
[0:27:19] <%dekkitout> It looks not terrible, but... when's pc tho
[0:27:19] <%Corporate_Redeemer> But when is it coming to PC tho? Kappa
[0:27:20] <boardscanada> Ghost of Tsushima has better graphics than this
[0:27:21] <DroppingDead> Yep LOL
[0:27:21] <%TheotherKristian> Splitscreen you fucks
[0:27:22] <+BinaryForest> Pat "I Have Never Liked Halo" Boivin: I don't like the look of this Halo
[0:27:22] <Neo_Kaiser> I love Halo and I hate 343 Halo
[0:27:22] <storytayl0r> And Paige is a warm comforter
[0:27:23] <+AlcoholicTarzan> Pat's a wet blanket? Wtf else did you expect?
[0:27:23] <ethanjbennett> Doom has ruined all other FPS
[0:27:24] <%GrayMatterMiner> I was excited, then I wasn't cuz'a this showcase
[0:27:24] <TallPixels> who gives a shit about pixels lmao
[0:27:24] <%CaptainPileDriver> YES
[0:27:24] <DE777ON> 343 making last gen games since 2000
[0:27:25] <BourneWarrior> EPIC
[0:27:25] <+raknikmik> It'll run on Xbox One as well?
[0:27:25] <henshinstronger6> it just looks lame??
[0:27:25] <%ChestMimik> Pat complains about a series he admitted to playing wrong
[0:27:25] <AFlyingTaco1> Did it have to be fucking open world?
[0:27:25] <lightmonarch1> late. wut I miss
[0:27:25] <$8BitDsx> There was so much texture pop-in during the driving segment lmao
[0:27:26] <OneThousandTomatoes> I bet woolie is having fun doing something else right now
[0:27:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> IT WAS
[0:27:27] <+Kickin_Against_the_Switz> I liked 4 but yeah Reach was peak
[0:27:28] <Mr_Ease> Its been 12 minutes and its all halo
[0:27:28] <%PlasticJake> I have zero faith in anything 343i touches, so my standards are already at rock bottom
[0:27:28] <%Thetruestblacksun> “JUST MAKE IT OLD” - Chat, I guess
[0:27:28] <Sporkgasm> reach last great campaign, 3 last great multiplayer
[0:27:28] <xxshadowxx416> am happy about it
[0:27:29] <TurtlesAndTentacles> Cause you're the black bile of negativity. she's the sunshine of skeletal happiness
[0:27:29] <+neutralraff> Yeah what else is new
[0:27:29] <+rheviel> I like Halo and I am interested. I also like Paige and her optimism. Pat is always so pessimistic.
[0:27:30] <BallerSwagBro9k> SURPRISE ME
[0:27:30] <+GingerStrawhat> I mean Pat's been a wet blanket in the last few game showcases
[0:27:31] <$Pompadourius> WORLD PREMIERE
[0:27:31] <RushUnplugged> but, was this real gameplay? they're replaying the same scenes exactly
[0:27:31] <dietmouintainmadewka> why are the elites and brutes working together again?
[0:27:31] <%xmetalicdemonx> yeah but open world is boring now.

[0:27:36] <IntrepidEye> I'm a Halo fan and gameplay looks good but story is underwhelming
[0:27:36] <+xendless_xurbia> take a shot
[0:27:38] <F1NG3RS> If this came out 5 years ago...
[0:27:38] <%Combatrobot423> I mean I'll be honest, the game looks aight, but it's not like spectacular or anything.

[0:27:50] <+MrAtheGreat> The problem withg the xbox is that they build up, not horizantally. They have Gears, Halo, and Forza, and they are only willing to expand upon thaty. They need to have more ips that reach more audiences.

[1:11:36] <RushUnplugged> Still seems a weird choice to announce 0 games for your console during your show, since it's ALL ON PC

[1:11:54] <+MillerLowlife> fable directed by george lucas

[1:11:56] <%astrofalcon1> tell me why...... i should buy a series x Kappa
[1:11:56] <CaptainBright> man, an 8 minute minidirect gave me more hype than this hour-long shmaltz

[1:11:58] <+arabundo> does the plasma gun have a chance to explode on you tho
[1:11:58] <+Pendragwn> NO IT'S NOT DONE

[1:12:03] <%indig0bird> That's good @Pendragwn
[1:12:07] <Gamer4life824> Wait that was all that's not good Xbox
[1:12:12] <GearVoltron> Boomers
[1:12:14] <%astrofalcon1> it's not done?
[1:12:15] <generalquackers> George Martin would rather die than let elden ring come out
[1:12:16] <RemnanTaka> what if they reveal the price!!!??
[1:12:16] <%Typhaeon> Stalker 2 & Psychonauts 2 look interesting at least
[1:12:16] <AFlyingTaco1> Lots of child murder in that event, thought
[1:12:17] <%michingmallecho> That sucked
[1:12:20] <%wjones0415> @dietmouintainmadewka it involved George r.r. Martin. are you surprised?
[1:12:21] <+beardedprof> HOLY SHIT i forgot about state of decay also LOL
[1:12:25] <%derekwst3> lets trick pat, everyone say HOT MIKE

[1:12:29] <+Promessa_EX> Price
[1:12:31] <%astrofalcon1> the ps5 doesn't even have a price and is more exciting
[1:12:34] <CMSpunky> TURN IT BACK ELDEN RING
[1:12:35] <gade177> @Sendaar Like every show that i've seen ever.
[1:12:37] <RinWR> Man this song's a banger
[1:12:45] <%astrofalcon1> ELDEN RING
[1:12:47] <%ChestMimik> They put John Halo in Smash wow Pat you missed it
[1:12:48] <+Mkingston> Got a new PC a year ago. Happy to stick with it. Got a PS4 and Switch too. I'll probably get a PS5 in 2-3 years.
[1:12:48] <%michingmallecho> Oh shit pat, they're announced DMC5: Vergil edition
[1:12:50] <%PrinnyNorth> PrinnyNorth subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! FABLE GET HYPED FOR PRODUCT!
[1:12:53] <nauticalgypsy> eh a hole load shite I couldn't give toss about same as usual lol
[1:12:55] <%CJett92> HOLY SHIT THEYRE SHOWING ELDEN RING COME BACKL
[1:12:56] <dukenux> what is strange magic?
[1:13:00] <+beardedprof> man the fact there wasnt even a 15 second teaser for elden ring OGH MY GOD PAT ITS ELDEN RING PAT
[1:13:06] <%derekwst3> pokemon snap 2
[1:13:11] <%ChestMimik> Every one watching gets a free cyberdong
[1:13:13] <generalquackers> Is elden ring exclusive ?
[1:13:14] <+Mkingston> @dukenux Google
[1:13:21] <laserbeaming> FABLE: The Revenge of Peter Molyneux
[1:13:24] <dukenux> no
[1:13:30] <%CJett92> ELDEN RING EXCLUSIVE FOR XBOX
[1:13:35] <%lockhead45> Damn that sucked hard
[1:13:50] <+Sendaar> Im really sick of this game of chicken they're doing with the price too
[1:13:51] <%Freddy253> TMM in 10 mins
[1:13:51] <MauroUnit1> this was, super underwhelming
[1:13:53] <henshinstronger6> I can't wait for Fable to have the same jank bullshit morality system
[1:13:56] <laserbeaming> All the stuff they showed for Xbawks is also on PC right?
[1:13:58] <GearVoltron> Fable with cock customization
[1:13:59] <+demon1103> The takeaway is, bunch of stuff eventually coming to PC gamepass. This is why im shifting towards microsoft "lookin at you sony!!!"
[1:14:00] <gade177> Can't wait 4 them 2 lie about the game mechanics in Fable.. That or greatly overextraate them.
[1:14:03] <%indig0bird> Everything sucked lol
[1:14:03] <%ChestMimik> I can't believe the only game with gameplay shown off was Halo and Psychonauts
[1:14:07] <dukenux> still no price announcment
[1:14:11] <%beardedprof> yes @laserbeaming
[1:14:12] <%linSP> Yay vagina vore monster time!
[1:14:13] <MauroUnit1> like there was decent shit in there but so poorly showcased
[1:14:15] <%Conyst> the longer they take to show the price of the new consoles the higher I assume it's going to be
[1:14:17] <%indig0bird> I'm more excited about the next FFXIV patch
[1:14:20] <generalquackers> man Halo looked real bad
[1:14:22] <%cvp5127> and still no price
[1:14:27] <%lockhead45> Guess Sony wins the whole fake E3 thing with Demons Souls alone
[1:14:39] <%BluBarracuda> @indig0bird agreed!
[1:14:41] <dukenux> well im glad about this crumb of Psychonauts 2 gameplay
[1:14:42] <NewWillinium> Fable Remake? So Peter Molyneux has come to reclaim the Throne of Lies from Todd Howard.
[1:14:43] <%derekwst3> watching the number of watchers go down by 40
[1:14:45] <+Jaysky> They showed gameplay off for the new PSO though
[1:14:48] <%miabyte> I'd ask what I missed but y'all seem dissappointed
[1:14:52] <%beardedprof> god if this was E3....what a bummer
[1:14:56] <+Mkingston> Sony and MS are playing chicken with the price reveals.
[1:14:57] <+Pendragwn> @gade177 they'll say Peter Molyneux isn't involved and that'll be a big lie
[1:15:11] <%linSP> I miss the e3 cringe bros
[1:15:12] <%ChestMimik> @jaysky my mistake. still weirdly low number
[1:15:23] <Gamer4life824> The only one I liked was Avowed and that's due to Obsidian and Paige but we saw next to nothing about it
[1:15:24] <generalquackers> @miabyte you missed G U N K
[1:15:30] <%JobbedBone> BibleThump is the best emote on twitch
[1:15:34] <%optimasmaximas> @miabyte i enjoyed it
[1:15:39] <+rheviel> Halo looked fine...just fine, nothing amazing. it looked like a Halo but big map.
[1:15:39] <%optimasmaximas> @miabyte THE GUNK
[1:15:40] <%miabyte> I have no context and I am very scared
[1:15:43] <gade177> @miabyte It's always a disappointment. Except Psychonauts 2 which apparently Pat doesn't like but whatever it's fine.
[1:15:46] <+chase959> karpDrink
[1:15:46] <%beardedprof> psaBougie
[1:15:47] <NewWillinium> That Pillars of Eternity First Person RPG has my really hype if I'm being honest. I LOVE that world and setting and if this gives Bethesda the kick in the ass it needs to start making their games more complex again then I am all for it.
[1:15:53] <Torivore> The only thing I missed from the show was Halo and the only reason I watched was for Halo feelsbad
[1:15:56] <+Jaysky> I only popped on halfway through so can't comment on the entire thing but I thought some titles looked interesting. I'm a sucker for PSO though so I had thought it was PSO3
[1:16:02] <%Razputin217> G U N K

[1:16:23] <%optimasmaximas> avowed, 40k darktide, the medium, and stalker 2 looked great
[1:16:26] <+Jaysky> Instead they were big cowards and called it "New Genesis"
[1:16:29] <cherrycottontail> I'm not sure how it's NOT pso3?
[1:16:32] <spacebowie749> I did

[1:27:38] <bleugh> halo 6finite
[1:27:39] <EyebrowsConnor> I dont think I've ever been interested in Halo ever. It's such a joke to see people freak out over it
[1:27:42] <danpc5> maybe 313 should make destiny and bungie should make halo

[1:28:01] <majima666> meh. i can wait for a couple of years then ill get a ps5
[1:28:02] <+desfore> The gameplay of Halo is the best thing going for it, so... openworld miiiight be fun
[1:28:03] <Gamer4life824> Just wait for the game to come to PC for mods that will fix ANY problems the game has
[1:28:06] <+lethallylactic> Yarntown seemed kind of bleh from what I saw of it. Cool that they released all the assets for free though. :)
[1:28:08] <majima666> i see no rush for next gen at the moment

[1:28:58] <%Shockrates20XX> yeah he was the leader of one of the countries
[1:28:59] <+Estuko> @desfore the thing with Halo is that the best parts are the action packed shooting jumping throwing stuff, Open World tells me there'll be parts of just traveling and backtracking for objectives. But I'll wait and see hoping it proves me wrong and is actually good
[1:28:59] <LordOfThePoultry> yes?
[1:29:01] <%optimasmaximas> YUEYEYEYEYE

[1:32:57] <+BurningLlama777> @Klefth I think this is what the Katamari dev always had in mind. The studio interfered and made them do the rolling ball

[1:34:28] <AngelCrossroads> I just got here. wtf is that shit....
[1:34:31] <%miabyte> So this is what happens when you crossbreed spaghetti with the meatballs
[1:34:33] <%drfaustisdead> It's very satisfying to look at.
[1:34:33] <$lotharrio> It's like the worst version of a house centipede.
[1:34:34] <%toastybites> Even though you play as the monster it's somehow still scary

[1:35:06] <arkv01> so this is aquateen meatballs final evolution?

[1:35:15] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt This is like if the Thing just didn't give a fuck about stealth and said "fuck it, I'm eating everyone NOW!"
[1:35:18] <Isord> Is this a metroidvania ?!
[1:35:19] <%wjones0415> its like your murder string!
[1:35:19] <Onatamana> Somebody touch-a the SPAGHET
[1:35:21] <+Estuko> I can't wait for a Bad DRagon of this.
[1:35:22] <$ragingbrachy> ok
[1:35:27] <%UvBenServed> Protect your shafts
[1:35:30] <EyebrowsConnor> If the game is anything shorter than 4 hours I'm calling it a scam
[1:35:30] <+UltraViolet371> Scream Strings
[1:35:31] <%holydeviant1> Plot: YOU MONSTER, EAT PEOPLE
[1:35:33] <Commander_Warthog> Somebody touched my spaghett.
[1:35:34] <%miabyte> I mean an unprotected shaft usually leads to an outbreak of some kind
[1:35:35] <+cammertime22> those info screens are very Oddworld
[1:35:36] <%Cozy90> @ScreamLord i love that movie so much
[1:35:36] <Diablo169> There isnt a plot afaik
[1:35:37] <arkv01> the music is really good
[1:35:37] <AngelCrossroads> Is this a new Carnage game?
[1:35:39] <%Starotter70> yooooo
[1:35:44] <generalquackers> Plot: CONSUME
[1:35:50] <+Pinkiefan> Unprotected shafts can be a problem.
[1:35:53] <%drfaustisdead> So to flatten the concept, this is a metroidvania where you play the metroid.
[1:35:54] <%Cozy90> The Thing is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[1:35:56] <Aydarkzero> @cammertime22 love that stuff
[1:35:56] <$SubjectTea> i missed the microsoft stream, what was pat's overall thoughts on the event?
[1:35:56] <Onatamana> Is this a metroidvania?
[1:36:03] <AngelCrossroads> @pinkiefan nice
[1:36:09] <$ragingbrachy> i can see something like this happening irl
[1:36:09] <+CraigAMcleod> Plot: You are Spigerder, Murder.
[1:36:13] <$ragingbrachy> this year even
[1:36:18] <%JenovasPuppet> He's got a gun!
[1:36:24] <%AncelDeLambert> interacting with things looks so awkward

[1:37:15] <+desfore> This is kinda... boring so far
[1:37:18] <Onatamana> I hope a pacifist run for the full game is possibl like in the demo
[1:37:21] <+cstigerwright> Is this just Alien:Isolation but from the Aliens perspective
[1:37:28] <%holydeviant1> I love how the kills in this feel like you're actually recreating a horror movie
[1:37:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> These humans REALLY fucked up the containment procedures.
[1:37:34] <+Estuko> the humans that get instantly killed got off easy
[1:37:40] <generalquackers> it's my first day!
[1:37:41] <ShoMibu> ROWR I WANNA EAT ROAR! Oh ello Pat outworldLUV
[1:37:48] <%Cozy90> What if the twist in the end is you're the good guy. :O
[1:37:51] <$lotharrio> That these people aren't just shooting everything constantly is amazing to me.
[1:37:55] <KeiPrime> when do they start putting up a challenge

[1:41:43] <Guardiansaiyan> December 2020 I vote for ALIENS
[1:41:44] <KeiPrime> donate your dna to the writhing fleshbeast
[1:41:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Guardiansaiyan @stardustcrusad3r i know right
[1:41:44] <+TOONFOOD> This is what happens if you flush spaghetti down the toilet
[1:41:46] <$ragingbrachy> i hope this happens
[1:41:47] <%Ynkubus_> Deveolver just released the actual monster today
[1:41:49] <%takutoots> this is what they found in the cave a couple months back
[1:41:50] <%Shubreaker> when can i submit to the fleshbeast
[1:41:51] <$lotharrio> I totally also saw it was chocolate the first time.

[1:41:56] <trashcansan> mmmm hamburger
[1:41:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> Red goo just MURDERS Steve Blum
[1:41:57] <ShoMibu> Ooh nice level transistions.
[1:42:01] <%linSP> Black hole Carrion, won’t you come
[1:42:03] <+Estuko> I was going to say a neat pvp deal but it'd just DBD LUL 3-4 others coop to unlock a door to escape and other player is just monster
[1:42:03] <%SGrim> As long as I get to become consciously in command of the meat beast, I could live with this being December.
[1:42:03] <%AncelDeLambert> we can only hope the Machine Overlords can protect us
[1:42:04] <$dalmek> is this a metroidvania where you are the metroid?
[1:42:04] <Aydarkzero> the signs really are Oddworld LUL
[1:42:06] <%RedoctoberWolf> you move so fast
[1:42:09] <Daigrey> I love Gross Metroid!
[1:42:12] <+Pinkiefan> Does the movement feel as fast and powerful as it looks?
[1:42:15] <%smellytooth> this is what flavortown looks like
[1:42:16] <AtisutoCurry> This things just an SCP isnt it lmao
[1:42:22] <ShadeNightz> This is some shit samus would come to destroy and be forced to blow up the planet in the process.
[1:42:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> Remember Gish
[1:42:33] <%miabyte> Omg is this a puzzle monster metroidvania?
[1:42:36] <AtisutoCurry> the flesh that really really reallllly hates
[1:42:37] <trashcansan> carrion is what cheap hotdogs are made of
[1:42:40] <henshinstronger6> Just push forward Pat
[1:42:41] <+Deekman> what is that maw on the wall?
[1:42:43] <+toficque> burp
[1:42:43] <OldOnyx> meh, don't see humanity having a mining colony in space this year. Rest is totally plausible though
[1:42:45] <%JenovasPuppet> Use your Meat Sense
[1:42:46] <Joustar_> speedy boy
[1:42:48] <%beardedprof> i know people complain about the lack of a map but honestly it not only makes NO sense a giant fleshy meatball would use one but also you move so fast and effectively it dosent matter.
[1:42:49] <henshinstronger6> It's pretty linear so far
[1:42:52] <CookieDoughFK> This game is just the warning, the covid response was the real ritual
[1:42:56] <Aydarkzero> @ShadeNightz that's Samus's solution to everything LUL
[1:42:58] <cobalt_phoenix_> man they did a good job with the sound
[1:43:03] <$HowIPendragon> This is where I'm stuck
[1:43:15] <EyebrowsConnor> I wonder what the Carrion monster SMELLS like
[1:43:15] <ShoMibu> Um.
[1:43:17] <%Cozy90> yeah the sound design is awesome!
[1:43:21] <%LiquidDinosaur> isnt this just Alex Mercer

[1:43:25] <%Shubreaker> no this is carrion \;-?\)
[1:43:25] <ShadeNightz> @Aydarkzero hey man. It'd actually be feasible this time, because this might not be able to die.
[1:43:26] <+KilogramHours> oh no
[1:43:26] <spacecatstreams> COOL
[1:43:26] <%JenovasPuppet> lol wut

[1:44:29] <Man_in_the_Red> Flashback is lookng real weird
[1:44:30] <Aydarkzero> the animation looks smooth
[1:44:30] <Ipsenscastle> antediluvian: from before the great flood
[1:44:32] <+Midashu> for a game about murdering and eating people, this is surprisingly one of the tamest #sponsored streams Pat has had.
[1:44:32] <%drfaustisdead> And we become Lovecraft.
[1:44:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> EFFLUVIAL GRIME
[1:44:34] <ShoMibu> c4 is overrated, c5 is where its at.
[1:44:35] <%Mendin> Is this a flashback... or a flashFORWARD?
[1:44:37] <EyebrowsConnor> Experience getting murdered by Carrion
[1:44:39] <%AncelDeLambert> so in this case, moss from before the facility got flooded
[1:44:40] <$ragingbrachy> blow those dude up
[1:44:46] <Aydarkzero> Vaal Hazak monkaS

[1:45:15] <%drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt did you ever play Sundered?
[1:45:16] <%AncelDeLambert> @PatStaresAt this is just the start of Metroid Fusion, now. The X is gonna attack HOLY SHIT CARRION IS THE X!
[1:45:23] <%crimsonharvest> yo
[1:45:23] <+Carquar> Oh you play as a regular ol' jerkoff in this too?
[1:45:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> WE NEED LIAM
[1:45:29] <%Cozy90> find a trophy system so you dont get killed by c4 spam
[1:45:36] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh man, what if Carrion is that dude?
[1:45:41] <laguerrilha> Didnt know there were human segments
[1:45:42] <jorniev> FUCKING LORE

[1:45:57] <ShoMibu> Nah he just misunderstood.
[1:45:57] <BallerSwagBro9k> So its Paige?
[1:45:58] <%miabyte> Remember 'The Baby?' This is him now. Feel old yet?
[1:45:58] <%AncelDeLambert> QUICK! FIND A METROID AND INJECT ITS CELLS!
[1:46:00] <$lotharrio> Is it the flood?
[1:46:00] <Onatamana> We need Samus to solve this problem before it gets worse.

[1:46:20] <+theenigmaticdude> no the lord made it that way
[1:46:21] <%JenovasPuppet> Carrion is the true evolutionary path man was always meant to take.
[1:46:21] <+Pinkiefan> This is what happens when I have naughty thoughts?
[1:46:23] <+RowenCleric> but what if MAN is the REAL monstars!?
[1:46:26] <%LiquidDinosaur> Wait in MEtroid what is The Baby
[1:46:28] <ShoMibu> Incenert Pats mom joke here.
[1:46:28] <%GeneralSCPatton> Pat, you have my approval to keep calling things abominations unto the Lord. It's very strong.
[1:46:29] <jorniev> what if carrion is just like the attack titan
[1:46:30] <%AncelDeLambert> You foolish fool, Mia! The BABY is what will SAVE us from this creature!
[1:46:31] <ShichiNoBushi> As we learned in Vampire: The Masquerade, "Antedeluvian" means before the flood.
[1:46:31] <%FluffiTamamo> So the goal of this game is to find the japanese school girls right?
[1:46:32] <%Cozy90> is this angry shuma gorath?
[1:46:33] <+Estuko> "Squeeze in" Please Kreygasm

[1:47:56] <$ragingbrachy> that guy sucked
[1:47:56] <TheChrona> This game *looks* awesome. Does it play good?
[1:47:58] <%Deadpal> lmao
[1:48:00] <%Cozy90> brave*
[1:48:04] <+Pinkiefan> Looks like the people who were eaten were the lucky ones.
[1:48:14] <%clockworknate> game plays like butter
[1:48:19] <stardustcrusad3r> you just ate that ladies ass
[1:48:20] <+TheBitingIrish> This huge writhing mass of flesh can seriously only take 5 handgun bullets? LUL
[1:48:24] <Clowns> nom nom
[1:48:26] <jorniev> nom nom
[1:48:29] <+terry_quest> Cronch
[1:48:30] <%abrupt_abe> God, it would be terrifying trying to shoot it and watching it inch closer
[1:48:36] <+MelodyMedley> Crunch
[1:48:39] <generalquackers> Monch
[1:48:41] <%Dakuu75> SCP: The Flesh that Hates
[1:48:42] <broaches> "bullets! my only weakness!" LUL
[1:48:42] <ShoMibu> Ass is where the tender side of the meat is i hear.
[1:48:43] <wqorst> leaving the legs like pizza crusts
[1:48:47] <%Cozy90> oh my god a speed run of this game is gonna look fucking awesome
[1:48:51] <+DeaconBluesClues> you underestimate GUN
[1:49:00] <%crimsonharvest> pat you might be the bad guy in this
[1:49:01] <+KingOfTheFist> So this is basically you play as John Carpenter's The Thing? But more murder less subterfuge
[1:49:08] <%ChaosAethr> Pat Finish Your Meals man
[1:49:10] <SeventyForce> The mortals, they are powerless
[1:49:10] <trashcansan> I like how the room becomes bloodly due to you moving around the room
[1:49:11] <%GeneralSCPatton> @abrupt_abe Inching? You mean Spider-Manning into you at high speed?
[1:49:12] <+TheBitingIrish> @abrupt_abe "Inching" is a gross understatement. This thing fucking hauls ass
[1:49:12] <Aydarkzero> the power of gun is indeed strong
[1:49:13] <stabbityrabbit> @abrupt_abe "Inch" You mean zoom forward toothy maw agape.
[1:49:13] <$dalmek> legs are human crusts
[1:49:14] <TheVulong> nah
[1:49:15] <%Mendin> Exactly so
[1:49:16] <%Starotter70> hmmm
[1:49:18] <Commander_Warthog> Are we the baddies?
[1:49:22] <BallerSwagBro9k> Are we the baddies?
[1:49:23] <%UvBenServed> Morally gray
[1:49:24] <+MillerLowlife> Carrion monster did nothing wrong
[1:49:25] <%Cozy90> No carrion has to eat the bad guys to save the children pat.
[1:49:25] <jorniev> you broght a gun TO A FLESH FEAST
[1:49:28] <Joustar_> Carrion only wants to help
[1:49:29] <%arcielardor> sexy flesh monster
[1:49:31] <TheVulong> those guys suck
[1:49:33] <AnneSQF> you'll get a redemtion arc, no worries
[1:49:33] <Priapeia> Voooooore
[1:49:34] <%JenovasPuppet> If Carrion can make meat walls, why doesn't it just make the entire facility meat?
[1:49:34] <+Extrallent> You might be the bad guy, but that doesn't make you a BAD guy
[1:49:35] <laguerrilha> Or maybe just misinterpreted meat
[1:49:36] <BallerSwagBro9k> TUTORIAL OBER
[1:49:37] <%miabyte> I think this is a respectable meat creature. Humanity is the real monster.
[1:49:39] <coyotezappa> You're not bad, just *hungry*
[1:49:41] <TheVulong> you cant eat them btw
[1:49:41] <Aydarkzero> DAMN
[1:49:42] <%luftraumm1> this game is cool, but kind of underwhelming
[1:49:42] <%dekkitout> Oof
[1:49:44] <ShoMibu> Whoa that guy was something.
[1:49:46] <chambatron> LUL
[1:49:46] <EyebrowsConnor> @PatStaresAt Do NOT finish your meals. Half-eaten bodies = healthpacks for later
[1:49:47] <%Deadpal> damn robots.
[1:49:51] <%madskull456> cum blast upgrade
[1:49:51] <ShoMibu> Andriod?
[1:49:52] <henshinstronger6> No health from these boys Pat
[1:49:53] <%AncelDeLambert> the horrible flesh consuming monstrosity that has no limit to its growth is evil? I never would have thought.
[1:49:53] <%SGrim> Too chewy
[1:49:54] <$lotharrio> Robo-boys
[1:49:55] <%Slimshazbot> So man that new Halo reveal was massively disappointing, huh?
[1:49:56] <%JobbedBone> androids?
[1:49:56] <$Afterman_> they are synthetics
[1:49:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Maybe you can't eat them after webbing them?
[1:49:57] <+taren817> Batter it around
[1:50:00] <%holydeviant1> Cyborgs not tasty
[1:50:00] <AtisutoCurry> armor?
[1:50:02] <Commander_Warthog> That suit is too chewy.
[1:50:05] <Aydarkzero> might be armored?
[1:50:07] <%Mendin> "Fangproof armor I am a genius OH NO"
[1:50:11] <chambatron> Hit it with a wall
[1:50:13] <%Cozy90> no go?
[1:50:13] <%clockworknate> bad guys trapped us and we just want to escape and get a bite on the way out .
[1:50:15] <+taren817> Try smashing them around
[1:50:16] <MoonKing> robots
[1:50:16] <jorniev> hard suits?
[1:50:18] <Joustar_> soundclip acquired
[1:50:19] <%AncelDeLambert> was that a plank with nails in it as a shield?
[1:50:21] <+BoboDaHobo> how can you be the bad guy if your body is made up entirely of good guys
[1:50:21] <Reilata> You ever know, those humans might all be massive assholes.
[1:50:21] <stardustcrusad3r> i feel like the new halo was the same halo but with grapple hook
[1:50:26] <%AncelDeLambert> how'd they make that so fast?
[1:50:26] <%Cozy90> :O
[1:50:27] <+MessyBristles> give me my gunk

[1:50:57] <chambatron> Pat grab the people and hit them to a wall andthen try eating them
[1:50:59] <generalquackers> my flesh pile swells with power
[1:51:00] <%holydeviant1> Sizes are different powers, eventually you'll need to swap between them
[1:51:00] <+TheBitingIrish> @Ipsenscastle Probably
[1:51:03] <+clockworkblues> We must grow
[1:51:04] <%Cozy90> this katamari is so angry
[1:51:08] <cobalt_phoenix_> IT'S GROWING
[1:51:12] <%AncelDeLambert> I wish this metroidvania was more metroid and more vania
[1:51:12] <henshinstronger6> The muhscles getting beeg
[1:51:15] <barucafe> is this a metroidvania
[1:51:18] <rambiray> that's some real thicc meat
[1:51:18] <%arcielardor> gorefield
[1:51:18] <jorniev> THE FLESH MONSTER HAS TRICKSTER!?
[1:51:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> Nah, Pat is playing the good guy. Everyone knows that the only moral imperative is for this solipsistic hellbeast to put the entire Universe inside of itself.
[1:51:24] <%Mendin> Pat you didn't enter the woolie hole
[1:51:24] <Daigrey> What are the odds of gross shinespark in this game?
[1:51:28] <+Pinkiefan> Ok is this game for sale now?
[1:51:29] <+gauntmon> He a big srong boi!
[1:51:30] <Isord> I wander if you get a map power in this
[1:51:32] <%SGrim> Swelling Tenecle Beast rooGasm
[1:51:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @barucafe yes except your the X Parasite
[1:51:40] <+apocplz> PBUH FSM
[1:51:41] <%abrupt_abe> It's not really a Metroidvania, the levels are actually pretty straight forward
[1:51:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> why do bullets hurt you so much
[1:51:48] <stabbityrabbit> So at what point do you start splitting into several smaller hell beast.
[1:51:48] <%maenos2> become gravemind
[1:51:50] <%TIME_PUNCHER> Alexa, play Carrion by Parkway Drive
[1:51:52] <%miabyte> Okay dude have fun. I haven't slept yet and don't wanna get spoiled too much. Have a good one. psaDab
[1:51:57] <%clockworknate> yea games good to buy
[1:51:57] <$ragingbrachy> lol
[1:51:58] <stabbityrabbit> Seems like the way this game is going.
[1:52:00] <rambiray> it's godzilla
[1:52:07] <%AncelDeLambert> @GeneralSCPatton I love how taht's basically the plot of Tales From Space: Mutant Blob Attacks
[1:52:08] <+toficque> knock knock
[1:52:08] <TheVulong> flesh monster gently opening the door
[1:52:08] <%Livelinne> Cronch
[1:52:14] <%Mendin> @LiquidDinosaur Probably because you're 70% spaghett and the bullets are hitting your orbs?
[1:52:14] <Man_in_the_Red> oh no, the monstar can use TOOLS
[1:52:18] <%Dakuu75> @miabyte doodBro
[1:52:19] <+Pinkiefan> I'm getting this game. Looks so fun.
[1:52:22] <%AncelDeLambert> You eat the sun in that game
[1:52:34] <%drfaustisdead> If there's one thing I know about Pat, it's that he's the king of biomass.
[1:52:39] <%Cozy90> is this what the red drug from deadly premonition leads to?
[1:52:40] <%RedoctoberWolf> can't wait for a hero like character to show up and be a challenge
[1:52:41] <ShoMibu> You thought it was safe, but NOOO!
[1:52:42] <laguerrilha> this game is great
[1:52:43] <generalquackers> bond with the woolie hole
[1:52:47] <Commander_Warthog> Are we going to eat the universe at the end?
[1:52:47] <%SGrim> You know Pat, it never said to kill everyone. rooThink
[1:52:50] <Tennochief> watching this while eating lunch is pretty weird
[1:53:04] <%AncelDeLambert> Everyone buy Mutant Blob Attacks. Did you like Guacamelee? It's by those guys. Buy it.
[1:53:18] <%crimsonharvest> get you some hazardous waste
[1:53:23] <Tennochief> Oh shit, really?
[1:53:26] <+CSNG> We need meat monster in Smash
[1:53:31] <%indig0bird> @Tennochief Right?
[1:53:35] <+Pinkiefan> Is this on Steam?
[1:53:39] <barucafe> does this game control well?
[1:53:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> you know what i bet would FUCK YOU UP? bleach or lye or anything to mess up your pH
[1:53:46] <+TheBitingIrish> I played Guacamelee but couldn't finish it FeelsBadMan
[1:53:46] <%AncelDeLambert> I mostly want to know how long this game is. Because if it's only ten hours then it's too short
[1:53:58] <jorniev> TAKE A SHIT
[1:53:59] <+TheBitingIrish> Just like Hollow Knight FeelsBadMan
[1:54:00] <%clockworknate> how did pat already get this far?
[1:54:05] <ShoMibu> interesting.
[1:54:07] <+KingOfTheFist> How is 10 hours too short
[1:54:08] <%emperordread> That's what I call the sexy time, depositing biomass
[1:54:09] <KeiPrime> i got a biomass deposit for ya
[1:54:10] <%JenovasPuppet> Pat do not deposit your biomass. That's illegal in Canada.
[1:54:11] <ShoMibu> Wonder what that do.
[1:54:15] <generalquackers> @AncelDeLambert waaaaaaay shorter than that
[1:54:23] <+TalekAetem> The whipping sounds are straight out of The Thing
[1:54:26] <%AncelDeLambert> that's unfortunate
[1:54:30] <Naho_Saenoki> @AncelDeLambert It's roughly 3-4 hours.
[1:54:30] <Man_in_the_Red> who cares if the game's too short, your just gonna get it when its 50% off anyways
[1:54:30] <danpc5> looks like a 2 to 4 hour game
[1:54:43] <Joustar_> oooooh
[1:54:45] <ShoMibu> Ooh.
[1:54:48] <%abrupt_abe> Puzzle tool
[1:54:52] <KeiPrime> get smoller
[1:54:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> Save some of yourself for later, as a snack
[1:54:56] <ShoMibu> Well thats neat.
[1:55:05] <%clockworknate> this games only like 20$
[1:55:07] <Aydarkzero> with a period Kappa
[1:55:08] <Bust_ER> solve the purzzle
[1:55:08] <Ipsenscastle> people need to know about the CAN EAT MORE
[1:55:09] <Shwepie> Deposit biomass to make children.
[1:55:09] <$lotharrio> Slim down for summer?
[1:55:10] <+ALazo> fit in a smaller hole
[1:55:10] <PanicSwytch> Deposit the orb for more orb
[1:55:11] <Joustar_> fit? maneuver?
[1:55:13] <%Mendin> Recombine
[1:55:13] <%Arazien> So you can squeeze through that bioass
[1:55:18] <OldOnyx> Shrink?
[1:55:19] <%SGrim> Lose some weight to fit that grate?
[1:55:20] <ShoMibu> Go from big peepee to little peepee to fit in tousers.
[1:55:26] <HellsCherry> beep beep pull over that biomass too phat
[1:55:27] <%BeezusHrist> TWITCH JUST BROKE LUL
[1:55:31] <+FreddyLeeSavage> That’s not the way i deposit my biomass
[1:55:32] <%AncelDeLambert> deposit so you can heal, I guess
[1:55:32] <Aydarkzero> too much chonk
[1:55:33] <+Aniki_Tony> nice
[1:55:39] <%thegreenbenis> How so?
[1:55:45] <%crimsonharvest> nom nom
[1:55:45] <+Pinkiefan> $20 is a lot for a four hour game, but I'd do $10.
[1:55:47] <%LiquidDinosaur> what does Depositing biomass do
[1:55:49] <+TheBitingIrish> MONCH
[1:55:53] <%thegreenbenis> @BeezusHrist How did it break?
[1:55:54] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ipsenscastle An odd pull, but very apropos
[1:55:56] <+demon1103> glad he figured it out easily...spent like 5 minutes wondering how do I switch abilities thinking i accidently broke the game XD
[1:56:03] <Aydarkzero> you could do worse w/ $20 tbh
[1:56:04] <%holydeviant1> Depositing biomass lets you get smol
[1:56:05] <Hideow> Crunchy
[1:56:17] <%ChaosAethr> You shouldnt be playing with your food
[1:56:22] <Guardiansaiyan> I can't WAIT for the fanfictions about this game
[1:56:24] <+TheBitingIrish> How long is the game? Anyone know?
[1:56:25] <%BeezusHrist> All the channels I was following disappeared for a moment
[1:56:34] <Guardiansaiyan> @TheBitingIrish 4 hours
[1:56:38] <+risenlp2> The meet yeet
[1:56:45] <%BeezusHrist> Pat disappeared
[1:56:56] <%thegreenbenis> @BeezusHrist Works for me.
[1:56:58] <+TheBitingIrish> Seems like a good game so far, if a little short
[1:56:59] <%Cozy90> if this monster was in a horror movie i dont think the movie would be very long
[1:57:12] <%nimu290> mines gone too
[1:57:17] <%BeezusHrist> @thegreenbenis I'm sure it does. Didn't for others
[1:57:19] <Crabking45> i just noticed this monster is a gibbering mouther from dnd
[1:57:25] <+Estuko> imagine being the guy who fucked the whole group over because he screamed while hiding
[1:57:37] <%GeneralSCPatton> @estuko Kind of
[1:57:43] <generalquackers> The hero we deserve
[1:57:52] <%GeneralSCPatton> Whoos, meant to @crabking45
[1:58:01] <+Estuko> LLU
[1:58:03] <+MrTurtleThief> I love the pace of this game

[1:59:04] <+mikesapartment> is this weird game good so far
[1:59:08] <%AncelDeLambert> get in the water?
[1:59:11] <%JenovasPuppet> Electric Meat
[1:59:18] <%abrupt_abe> PC, Xbox, Switch
[1:59:22] <%FluffiTamamo> As long as the meatloaf isnt moving
[1:59:26] <%BeezusHrist> We just had a big ass fire that took weeks to put out, and now it's raining. Mud slides incoming
[1:59:26] <%cantusgray> cantusgray subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:59:27] <ThatButler> You may not like it, but this is what peak physical fitness looks llike.
[1:59:28] <Tennochief> @honeyman18 I'm eating crunchy Popeyes, it's not too weird
[1:59:31] <+FreddyLeeSavage> @honeyman18 it’s weird you’re making meatloaf period
[1:59:37] <%JenovasPuppet> Can you switch to the deposited biomass?
[1:59:44] <%drfaustisdead> @PatStaresAt this OST is simple but on point.
[1:59:48] <lilb00fpack> @thatbutler F A C T S
[1:59:56] <+AJiiij> idk why I'm so intrigued by this
[1:59:58] <%honeyman18> @freddyleesavage but it's got brown sugar glaze and ketchup
[2:00:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BeezusHrist forest fighterfighrer?
[2:00:03] <+Aniki_Tony> new power?
[2:00:04] <%GeneralSCPatton> Might be an upgrade
[2:00:07] <TheVulong> @ThatButler no fat only man eating flesh
[2:00:09] <%clockworknate> unless you are playing meatloaf while making meatloaf then its not weird
[2:00:14] <Guardiansaiyan> @AJiiij new type of movement seen in a game
[2:00:17] <henshinstronger6> Just push onward Pat
[2:00:20] <$Afterman_> you deposit biomass when you need to use a different ability. the charge attack replaces the web attack for example
[2:00:21] <+visidan> oh god the screenshots of halo 5 have me cryin
[2:00:29] <%BeezusHrist> @LiquidDinosaur Bighorn fire. It was a wildfire
[2:00:31] <+FreddyLeeSavage> @honeyman18 ok now i approve
[2:00:33] <%Arazien> He would do anything for mass, but he won't do that.
[2:00:35] <+smevvster> Pat, if you could achieve immortality at the cost of basically becoming this creature, would you do it?
[2:00:42] <%RedoctoberWolf> puzzle solved
[2:00:45] <ethanjbennett> just carry on
[2:00:46] <+TheBitingIrish> One-way pipes?
[2:00:56] <TheVulong> who wouldnt do it
[2:01:02] <Billli11> freshback machine?
[2:01:04] <1matheuw> keep calm and carry on
[2:01:05] <%ChestMimik> @smevvster I would at least think about it
[2:01:19] <+Estuko> I'd think very hard about it
[2:01:19] <+apocplz> keep calm and carry on barbToxic
[2:01:20] <1matheuw> fleshbakc?
[2:01:21] <%clockworknate> @smevvster pat already said he would become a toilet seat soooooo
[2:01:22] <%LiquidDinosaur> @BeezusHrist buddy of mine is one of you guys. idk what state he's in rn
[2:01:27] <%SGrim> @smevvster do I retain my full faculties?
[2:01:34] <+AcrutaLao> He was too big brained
[2:01:41] <%Cozy90> is this the past or present?
[2:01:41] <jorniev> IS THIS A FLASH FOWARD!?
[2:01:45] <ThatButler> How can you love a man that hasn't transcended bipedal locomotion?
[2:01:46] <+Estuko> @ChestMimik oh fuck me, I just realized that means I don't have to work retail ever again.
[2:01:58] <+smevvster> Current personality and intelligence level maintained, but you're basically John Carpenter's Thing
[2:01:58] <Guardiansaiyan> @jorniev flash back
[2:01:58] <%DianaTheAscian> seems like a flash forward
[2:01:59] <%king_wragles> Jesus, he chained the human sections together?
[2:02:02] <generalquackers> the futures futures future
[2:02:02] <%gus_hornblende> these flashbacks give serious "start of super metroid" vibes
[2:02:22] <%Cozy90> who builds a station like this?
[2:02:23] <%LiquidDinosaur> does this guy become the fleshbeast
[2:02:24] <%GeneralSCPatton> @gus_hornblende It's more Metroid Fusion
[2:02:31] <%drfaustisdead> I wonder if the details change based on your kills? I Still think this is a flash forward.
[2:02:37] <%ChestMimik> @smevvster So basically I get to be exactly the same but also a hentai protagonist. i see that as an absolute win.
[2:02:40] <%notgarza> What a shit place to work Kappa

[2:02:45] <%SGrim> Modern Day?
[2:02:46] <Reilata> Being a giant fleshbeast seems pretty sick, so I'd be pretty down.
[2:02:49] <$lotharrio> Drink the red sarcophagus goo.
[2:02:55] <%Aeoneth> This is just a SCP Containment Breach
[2:02:59] <%LiquidDinosaur> STRONK
[2:03:00] <%Cozy90> this place is massive. what is the point of this place?
[2:03:02] <%drfaustisdead> Okay. it's a Lovecraft.
[2:03:06] <TheVulong> Is it possible that someone fought a war against the living flesh before?
[2:03:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> HE IS THE FUCKING STRONG
[2:03:11] <+Jaysky> Just a perfectly normal human being
[2:03:17] <generalquackers> SHITS LOCKED

[2:04:02] <Onatamana> Why did you touch the thing
[2:04:04] <KeiPrime> the original biobeast
[2:04:05] <TheVulong> who can blame them
[2:04:05] <+AcrutaLao> But SCIENCE
[2:04:05] <$lotharrio> Keep calm and carrion.
[2:04:06] <+xeros720> scientists have drones with them, refuse to use drones
[2:04:07] <henshinstronger6> drink up babes
[2:04:12] <ThatButler> "At last, we found it. The original spicy meatball"
[2:04:15] <+mMayrro> humans fucking up? what a concept!
[2:04:15] <%Aeoneth> If they wanted to study it they shoulda done that ON SITE

[2:04:23] <%Typhaeon> The chicken sound effect
[2:04:23] <Joustar_> look at this goo thing, let's study it
[2:04:25] <%Cozy90> i wonder if they could have gotten a game like this in the 16 bit era.
[2:04:26] <Billli11> web it?
[2:04:27] <%Dakuu75> it opens the door by the water
[2:04:28] <+ShinyBisharp1> @PatStaresAt it's for later go thropugh the open door goofy
[2:04:31] <TheVulong> LATER THING
[2:04:32] <%toastybites> it's the door
[2:04:33] <generalquackers> @PatStaresAt its a later game ability, just move foward
[2:04:35] <laguerrilha> Can you shock it while on water?
[2:04:41] <+Risingxiv> I like the little hit marker on your tentacle
[2:04:42] <%JenovasPuppet> It makes you electric and that opens the door.
[2:04:45] <%CrookedSpiral> there's a door in that room
[2:04:50] <%thewordofhelix> deposit biomass and shoot box with web
[2:04:51] <+Mkingston> Carrion Screaming! (There's a joke for the Brits in the chat).

[2:07:44] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JenovasPuppet the Keyser Soze of lovecraftian flesh beasts
[2:07:45] <%GeneralSCPatton> I wonder if there are achievements or a secret ending for some kind of pacifist run.
[2:07:46] <+JingKaisean> this looks liek a metroid room
[2:07:47] <Parapattern> OOG RIP ON HEAD OFF
[2:07:47] <KeiPrime> damn, abuse. now theres a fuckin game
[2:08:03] <Guardiansaiyan> @Jaysky I would rather have AI overlords THANK YOU
[2:08:14] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt is Carrion evil or just hungry?
[2:08:18] <ThatButler> Imagine if this was a story about a monster that wasn't a bloodthirsty animal, but merely dangerously clumsy.
[2:08:18] <%SGrim> BDSM: Big Damn Sadistic Meatball BloodTrail
[2:08:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Parapattern SOL-TAR THE WARRIOR
[2:08:20] <Ipsenscastle> it does look like Flashback

[2:08:30] <Arth__> this looks like starbound
[2:08:33] <featherlan> Stardust Speedway Zone 1
[2:08:35] <ethanjbennett> damn
[2:08:36] <thatperson462> carrion is a misunderstood protagonist
[2:08:44] <AncyentMarinere> He left the bio mass back there
[2:08:48] <Guardiansaiyan> @StaceMcGate we don't have all the lore yet
[2:08:58] <ThatButler> "Oops, haha, I accidentally impaled a few people while walking"
[2:09:05] <Guardiansaiyan> @AncyentMarinere he can get it later cause he might NEED IT later
[2:09:07] <%unremarkableprodigy> So im playing carrion and later in the game i did something that made it impossible to continue and only fixed it by doing something I probably shouldnt of been able to
[2:09:09] <generalquackers> Carrion is the Tsundere we all need
[2:09:09] <%gus_hornblende> @thatperson462 carrion is morally grey
[2:09:17] <+desfore> PIPE
[2:09:19] <%SGrim> water pipe
[2:09:19] <+atravelbee> Went fishing and had a container of fake blood worms, well they melted a little after a few hours and I realized I had my own little carrion in a jar.

[2:09:50] <+Jaysky> The carrion beast is lawful good
[2:09:52] <Guardiansaiyan> use BLOND emotes dude
[2:09:53] <%GeneralSCPatton> @stacemcgate What are you talking about? Morality doesn't real, you idiot. There is only HONGRY AND CRONCH. Didn't you learn anything at solipsistic monster school?
[2:09:55] <Guardiansaiyan> BLIND
[2:09:57] <+primax104> this looks pretty disgusting. Good job devolver

[2:10:04] <%koolaid_kevster> psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind psaBlind
[2:10:08] <%honeyman18> to be fair, I dont think the flesh beast needs eyes
[2:10:14] <%thewordofhelix> shoot electrical box with web?
[2:10:16] <$lotharrio> The Carrion Beast is morally grey.
[2:10:19] <%toastybites> @Dakuu75 it seems like a laser door that triggers unless you disable the green laser
[2:10:21] <+primax104> they've nailed the feel of a flesh beast
[2:10:28] <+EscoSul> good job
[2:10:38] <%toastybites> @Dakuu75 but probably the same thing
[2:10:43] <generalquackers> This flesh beast handles like a dream

[2:12:15] <%JobbedBone> is the yellow bar armor and green is health?
[2:12:23] <%GeneralSCPatton> @jobbedbone The colors denote size thresholds. You are big and have different abilities if you have enough health.
[2:12:25] <%toolofparanoia> Burn it!

[2:12:44] <%ChestMimik> yellow is for big sli.e, green is for small. it affects your abilities
[2:12:45] <+HotBloodedHero> This game looks like it's in the same engine as Noita
[2:12:46] <+apocplz> oh shit
[2:12:49] <%FluffiTamamo> @JobbedBone 2 different levels of health. the yellow is the next size up.
[2:12:49] <%JenovasPuppet> Meat go down
[2:12:50] <%holydeviant1> Drones are scary at first
[2:12:54] <%Dakuu75> @JobbedBone it's all health, the different colors are the different sizes you can be
[2:13:02] <%holydeviant1> Then you learn to just grab them and bang them on things
[2:13:05] <%holydeviant1> like that
[2:13:10] <+mMayrro> SourPls
[2:13:13] <generalquackers> @AncelDeLambert True Pat essence

[2:14:02] <Parapattern> This is what Pat and Paige's child will look like
[2:14:03] <%AncelDeLambert> wouldn't that just be a bundle of yarn?

[2:21:20] <yeeyeyee> pat...

[2:21:23] <TheVulong> go back

[2:21:27] <EMP_SaltyMan> deposit some ass
[2:21:28] <%StaceMcGate> PAT
[2:21:28] <JayEarly> mustard chafe killed aliens and didn't afraid of them
[2:21:29] <%Typhaeon> It's not like you to use euphemisms for defecation
[2:21:30] <+Victorious_Drago> pat
[2:21:32] <$lotharrio> Now when Pat deposits biomass, does he get naked?
[2:21:34] <+Victorious_Drago> it was right by the door pat
[2:21:36] <%arcielardor> you're a genetically modified rat looking for choes
[2:21:36] <yeeyeyee> pat... you can just go around it....
[2:21:37] <%holydeviant1> You can only be invisible and shoot webbing in form one, you can charge in form two
[2:21:38] <TheVulong> taking the scenic route then
[2:21:43] <+Estuko> Depositing Biomass is another hilarious thing to say.
[2:21:45] <%Starotter70> psaBlind
[2:21:51] <$dalmek> Meunster Chef is the greatest of all supersoldiers
[2:21:52] <Tennochief> Carrion is Flamin' Hot Spaghetti
[2:21:58] <+Pinkiefan> @lotharrio I got that reference.
[2:22:10] <SolsticeZro> it's learning monkaS
[2:22:10] <%JenovasPuppet> You... did it
[2:22:12] <JayEarly> is taking dump literally depositing biomass?
[2:22:15] <AtisutoCurry> carry on
[2:22:19] <$lotharrio> @Pinkiefan You're one of the good ones.
[2:22:25] <turbofolk> left a survivor
[2:22:32] <%Cozy90> i deposit bio mass into the toilet every day
[2:22:35] <1matheuw> @JayEarly ye
[2:22:52] <+EscoSul> I miss you so much biomass
[2:22:52] <$KnivesEve> i wish i could be happy about the new pso2 expansion but i know it'll still be on the mircosoft store, tragic
[2:22:56] <+Estuko> FeelsGoodMan when you find your Biomass waiting for you and you get to consume it back into your flesh
[2:23:02] <dan_g_v> clever way to show that you have cleared an area. Red alert and such
[2:23:02] <%maenos2> seals: breached. biomass: absorbed. dicks: tentacles.
[2:23:05] <thetruthofyourbeing> yay more teeth
[2:23:18] <%JenovasPuppet> Yeyeye
[2:23:22] <$lotharrio> You did it, Pat!
[2:23:23] <+TOONFOOD> This is pretty neat!
[2:23:25] <+Cuon_Alpinus> Socialist teeth!
[2:23:26] <haisho> huh I thought Pat would HATE finding his biomass in his quest to become an immortal toilet
[2:23:28] <laguerrilha> hope the carrion gets even bigger
[2:23:30] <HeavyManaBeast2> yah very sad, big pso fan
[2:23:31] <Joustar_> after playing this game, Pat now identifies as a writhing flesh mass with teeth
[2:23:32] <+mMayrro> Leviathan monkaS
[2:23:36] <%Reveresao> @PatStaresAt Mixer is now offically fucking dead
[2:23:37] <+Byronic_dreamer> @patstaresat the way that thing moves is horrifying
[2:23:59] <%Typhaeon> Pretty sure robots don't scream
[2:24:00] <chikensandwich> this game is dope
[2:24:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> you know if they just made a microwave hallway you'd be fucked
[2:24:03] <%toolofparanoia> This is what happenes when Pat's ORB goes rogue
[2:24:03] <JayEarly> did that robot scream?
[2:24:07] <%Cozy90> yay
[2:24:13] <+Pinkiefan> I want that clipped. Pat gleefully saying, "My biomass!"
[2:24:17] <%hax_metatron> CARRION MY WAYWARD SON
[2:24:29] <%LiquidDinosaur> Keep Calm an Carrion
[2:24:34] <SolsticeZro> oh those are robots I thought it's guys shooting at you
[2:24:35] <JayEarly> THERE WILL BE MEAT WHEN YOU ARE DONE
[2:24:39] <%maenos2> what does the carrion smell like you think
[2:24:42] <laguerrilha> are they robots or the suit is just too resistent to eat?
[2:24:43] <TheVulong> too bad Paige isnt around for this
[2:24:45] <%Dementedpenguin> Oof
[2:24:49] <%Mendin> Pink polo shirt security?
[2:24:51] <nerdypanda> gnnnnaaash
[2:24:53] <+mMayrro> I love how carrion beast randomly makes chicken noises
[2:24:54] <%toolofparanoia> The Orb requires biomass
[2:25:01] <%toolofparanoia> one could say
[2:25:05] <%dekkitout> How long till Carrion fights Mecha-Carrion?
[2:25:06] <featherlan> You cut that man in half with a DOOR
[2:25:07] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Mendin Dudebro PMC
[2:25:13] <%toolofparanoia> THE ORD HUNGER!
[2:25:16] <chikensandwich> spaghetti meatball simulator
[2:25:16] <%JenovasPuppet> There will be peace when you are done.
[2:25:23] <%toolofparanoia> *ORB
[2:25:28] <SolsticeZro> this is metal af
[2:25:39] <%Cozy90> that was incredibly bloody
[2:25:39] <+Aniki_Tony> That is pretty cool....
[2:25:42] <$lotharrio> This is what Prototype 2 should have been.
[2:25:50] <JayEarly> can't wait for vtubers to play this
[2:25:51] <+Aniki_Tony> the dragging the human like a true spooky mn
[2:25:56] <featherlan> @dekkitout What would Mecha-Carrion be made of?
[2:26:03] <HeavyManaBeast2> i agree
[2:26:04] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt imagine if prototype was this cool
[2:26:08] <laguerrilha> the way you grabbed her leg and dragged her away to another floor is just like an horror movie
[2:26:08] <%dekkitout> Nanomachines, son
[2:26:15] <generalquackers> mecha-viscera
[2:26:15] <dan_g_v> robots give energy?
[2:26:23] <Guardiansaiyan> MAKE SURE
[2:26:25] <featherlan> Okay, that's fair XD
[2:26:30] <%Mendin> Just worry that corpse like a dog
[2:26:30] <+TomServal> @featherlan Gray Goo Scenario.
[2:26:31] <%Cozy90> psaHoldon
[2:26:32] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lotharrio i could never get into Prototype because i hate Alex Mercer's outfit so much. WHY IS HE WEARING LIKE 4 JACKETS IN THE NYC AUTUMN
[2:26:34] <%Typhaeon> Pretty sure those are just guys in inedible suits
[2:26:34] <$lotharrio> Harder. With the teeth.
[2:26:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> If Carrion could speak, it would just be the giant head+arm voiced by Louis C.K. in Gravity Falls. "Hey you, yeah I'm talking to you. I think you want to come over here and get in my mouth."
[2:26:38] <SolsticeZro> make sure nothing is wasted
[2:26:45] <zerk360> @featherlan siva
[2:26:46] <+burgerdicks> Is it all control stick?
[2:26:52] <bluebiscuit94> !uptime

[2:26:58] <JayEarly> @LiquidDinosaur he's just that cool
[2:27:03] <roninkojiro> Or just from the other side
[2:27:09] <trashcansan> ooo the music is nice
[2:27:10] <ha2ken> This biomass reminds me of Carnage but worse
[2:27:17] <+Estuko> monkaS
[2:27:27] <%kewlmyc> As if this entire game isn't nightmare fuel
[2:27:38] <+Pinkiefan> Final form?
[2:27:38] <LooneyToons8895> are we missing any important details in the bottom left corner?
[2:27:39] <theanora1> this game looks real cool
[2:27:39] <SolsticeZro> expanding nightmare
[2:27:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lotharrio also i guess its kind of cool how it was like "wow im a eldritch abomination that just exists to kill and consume flesh and even i am disguted at what an asshole the actual Alex Mercer was"
[2:27:50] <%Cozy90> bigerer
[2:27:51] <joecani> Ps4?
[2:27:51] <+burgerdicks> How does it control?
[2:27:52] <+Estuko> imagine a beast so angry it doesn't eat you it just ravages your body with its teeth because fuck you

[2:28:09] <Guardiansaiyan> ELMO PILL
[2:28:10] <%Cozy90> lawful neutral
[2:28:10] <%Mendin> I've gone from watching Woolie's DOOM LPs to this, different levels of Rip & Tear Hellbeasts
[2:28:11] <Parapattern> Imagine you're just standing around having a good time at your lab job and then this thing just comes tearing ass down a hallway and rips you to fucking pieces.
[2:28:16] <JayEarly> Elmo pill?
[2:28:19] <+taren817> Pat you sounded like a chicken
[2:28:20] <1matheuw> EAT THE HAIR PAT
[2:28:21] <SolsticeZro> Elmo resistance pill
[2:28:21] <%nofestu2> psaDab achoo
[2:28:21] <Tennochief> now make fun of Pat while he's gone
[2:28:21] <HollowDragon231> Imagine the H-Game equivalent to this
[2:28:23] <EMP_SaltyMan> lol Alex Mercer is a huge jerk
[2:28:24] <%M3djedx> psaPorgmo
[2:28:29] <+taren817> @JayEarly I imagine an allergy pill to help with Elmo's fur
[2:28:31] <$lotharrio> Imagine inviting a monster into your home and forgetting to take the pills that protect you from its spores.
[2:28:33] <%Typhaeon> At least it'd kill me quickly, unlike life
[2:28:33] <laguerrilha> Allergy pill?
[2:28:33] <%Livelinne> lomBless lomBless lomBless
[2:28:34] <%ssjklyco> People are dumb
[2:28:37] <%arancet> elmo-b-gon
[2:28:38] <SolsticeZro> because Elmo has become too strong
[2:28:39] <+EscoSul> w-what goes into a elmo pill?
[2:28:39] <Tennochief> Boy, Pat is so big butted
[2:28:40] <Commander_Warthog> Antihistamines?
[2:28:40] <%dekkitout> @ha2ken Would you believe me if I said Carnage recently had to collect biomass from the spines from a lot of marvel characters, including ghost rider?
[2:28:40] <haisho> oh no
[2:28:42] <%Cozy90> do you have to take clariton... all the time???
[2:28:43] <%GeneralSCPatton> It protects from THE SPORES
[2:28:44] <theanora1> Is pat going to swallow Elmo whole, lika pill?
[2:28:46] <%Dr_DangerPhD> Elmo spores are already taking root
[2:28:47] <+Pendragwn> @PatStaresAt drugs D:
[2:28:48] <%LiquidDinosaur> @lotharrio "Alex Mercer is the worst piece of shit on the face of the earth"
[2:28:49] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Is Elmo the generic brand?
[2:28:49] <+EscoSul> how many elmos are in a elmo pill
[2:28:49] <HollowDragon231> You are a monster that goes around tentacling anime girls
[2:28:50] <+gwanzan> Alegra always worked better for me
[2:28:52] <turbofolk> I remember Pat being all pissy that he was allergic to elmo
[2:28:54] <LooneyToons8895> it's an elmo... in pill form
[2:28:55] <trashcansan> taking drugs on stream
[2:28:55] <+Estuko> @Parapattern Imagine leaving the office after being told you're let go from the company because of costs and this thing is coming at you like a steam engine.
[2:28:58] <Reckless_Rob> *scratch*
[2:28:59] <+Aniki_Tony> i do like this creepy music chimed in while he smooched Elmo
[2:28:59] <%Typhaeon> Good job taking your drugs
[2:29:00] <+robobeau> Yo that shit gives me sleep paralysis, fuck Claritin
[2:29:03] <HollowDragon231> Also I can hear the stock chicken sound effect in that slash attack!
[2:29:04] <+FackinCrazy> Do you take that every day? is that healthy
[2:29:04] <KaiserMario> Kissing the piss out of Elmo huh?
[2:29:05] <trashcansan> popping pills live
[2:29:06] <laguerrilha> @PatStaresAt You take it daily?

[2:29:20] <$lotharrio> So Paige IS around for this game.
[2:29:20] <HollowDragon231> Carrion vs Corona who wins?
[2:29:20] <%Typhaeon> Excellent use of chicken foley
[2:29:26] <%JenovasPuppet> Carrion is the physical representation of Elmo spores in your nose.
[2:29:26] <%Cozy90> could samus beat this monster?
[2:29:27] <%Mendin> Horrifying Flesh Serpent
[2:29:33] <%hax_metatron> Claritin results in increased chances of depression FYI
[2:29:36] <%Typhaeon> I knew it was just like Werner Herzog said: chickens are evil, malicious, stupid creatures
[2:29:40] <+Pinkiefan> Sponsored content.
[2:29:41] <Reckless_Rob> This hentai is weird
[2:29:41] <ha2ken> @dekkitout That sounds both awesome and horrifying at the same time.
[2:29:51] <HollowDragon231> Technically, if you die, you won't be depressed
[2:29:51] <trashcansan> corona beats carrion because you can't shoot a virus
[2:30:02] <JayEarly> idk I took care of a neighbor's chickens and they were pretty chill
[2:30:03] <%GeneralSCPatton> @cozy90 I think Ice+Wave Beam is a strong counter.
[2:30:04] <%Typhaeon> That guy survived, what a trooper
[2:30:05] <SolsticeZro> they thought they were safe PepeLaugh
[2:30:06] <HollowDragon231> Watch me

[2:32:27] <%Shockrates20XX> The base must be enormous.
[2:32:39] <%JenovasPuppet> I love that they made an entire game based on the end of Inside
[2:32:39] <Shardlab> Everything is going to hell in a handbasket Quick!
[2:32:41] <%Cozy90> the tentacle movement is so cool
[2:32:42] <ThatButler> What an interesting design choice for music, going for an ambient horror theme instead of DMX's X Gunna Give It To Ya on constant loop.
[2:32:42] <gluemanofficial> Noodle time

[2:32:55] <$QueequegTheater> @PatStaresAt Just watched the Halo gameplay, and honestly if they just make the hook a bit faster I think I'm excited again

[2:33:17] <%ToneBacas> these guys have no chance
[2:33:22] <super_robo_mg> Nutritious and delicious and very malicious
[2:33:28] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ThatButler how about Bring Your Whole Crew. that's the one that starts "I GOT BLOOD ON MY HANDS AND THERE'S NO REMORSE / I GOT BLOOD ON MY DICK CUZ I FUCKED A CORPSE"
[2:33:28] <+TomServal> More BRRRRRRRT!
[2:33:35] <HollowDragon231> Gently Opening Doors as a flesh beast is somehow fucking hilarious to me.
[2:33:40] <%Typhaeon> Smart turret
[2:33:41] <%holydeviant1> Note: If your flesh beast is shooting green shit when you eat, it's full
[2:33:49] <Onatamana> it's unvuncibul
[2:33:49] <Shardlab> Machines are your enemy
[2:33:54] <SolsticeZro> poking the turret
[2:33:57] <PirateMike_> can i get dlc that turns carrion into a spaghetti monster?
[2:33:57] <StrawberryBandit> the lil arm that extends out is almost cute @HollowDragon231
[2:33:58] <ThatButler> That's also a good choice
[2:34:01] <Guardiansaiyan> @HollowDragon231 st least they know how expensive doors can be
[2:34:07] <HealingMind> Imagine this being a horror game thing, where a giant red monster just warps to your location and one-shots you.
[2:34:11] <%holydeviant1> Ahahah, this puzzle took me like half an hour
[2:34:14] <+Pinkiefan> Looks like it moves 30-40 mph. That thing can book it.
[2:34:15] <%toolofparanoia> want more science back story
[2:34:21] <LenDawsonsFresca> the way Pat misses the last person sometimes makes it look like the monster is just looming ominously over a person right before it kills them
[2:34:27] <featherlan> Woah
[2:34:29] <JayEarly> @Aniki_Tony the creature learns how to turn human shaped but it's face is still a horrifying mouth
[2:34:34] <Billli11> web it
[2:34:36] <featherlan> That transformation effect was cool
[2:34:39] <%king_wragles> Real quick, what's the hardest enemy Pat has fought?
[2:34:46] <JayEarly> "Hello, fellow humans"
[2:34:49] <HollowDragon231> I went into a room, and gently opened the door to let people escape only to eat them in the next room
[2:34:49] <+Aniki_Tony> @JayEarly Yeeeeee
[2:34:50] <%holydeviant1> GIANT MECH
[2:34:53] <%LiquidDinosaur> @JayEarly so does it fool people from far away but not close?
[2:34:59] <+TomServal> The Mech.
[2:35:02] <%WackyGear> WackyGear subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months, currently on a 31 month streak! Hey Pat, I'm what do you think about the obsidian elder scrolls RPG? Do you think it will scratch that elder scrolls itch? Personally, due to the nonstop list of recent Bethesda shenanigans, I have way more faith in obsidian right now.
[2:35:04] <%king_wragles> God fuck, he's just ahead of me
[2:35:09] <%king_wragles> Fucking mech

[2:35:15] <HollowDragon231> How do you do fellow sapient meatsacs?
[2:35:28] <$lotharrio> @king_wragles The first flamethrower guy was tough.
[2:35:33] <%GeneralSCPatton> Biomass is his favorite food. And screaming is his favorite flavor.
[2:35:33] <%LiquidDinosaur> ZEUS SPOTTED
[2:35:39] <featherlan> I kinda wanna draw a character that is a Carrion
[2:35:44] <%holydeviant1> that lunging leap out of the water was right out of a fucking movie
[2:35:45] <%maenos2> mechs
[2:35:47] <HopIophobia> I am well. I am considering venturing from my den to add more biomass to my self soon.
[2:35:56] <+smevvster> God I would give anything to become a sapient fleshbeast
[2:35:58] <SolsticeZro> big blob
[2:35:58] <KaiserMario> @PatStaresAt If you had the choice of becoming immortal brain in jar with robo-body, and giant biomass goo-monster, which would you choose?
[2:36:00] <ha2ken> Has there been a flamethrower enemy yet?
[2:36:09] <%LiquidDinosaur> yes
[2:36:10] <%Typhaeon> Well that guy has the most boring job in the world
[2:36:12] <%Mendin> Speedruns of this are going to be comedic
[2:36:12] <+TomServal> Yes actually.
[2:36:13] <%JenovasPuppet> Many flamethrowers so far
[2:36:14] <+EscoSul> yeah
[2:36:16] <Naho_Saenoki> @ha2ken There have been several.
[2:36:20] <Daskolin> Are those Pre dark age of mankind warhammer mechs?
[2:36:21] <%Mendin> Flamethrower guys exist and they fucking HURT
[2:36:21] <JayEarly> several flamethrower guys
[2:36:24] <+TomServal> It was easy to kill.
[2:36:26] <%GeneralSCPatton> @ha2ken Yes. You rapidly burn until you jump in water.
[2:36:28] <ha2ken> Ok. That's a given.
[2:36:29] <HollowDragon231> Pat would still choose immortal brain because BioMass is the other extreme, where you're all disguisting 100%
[2:36:34] <%holydeviant1> I a tually wanna see speedruns of this
[2:36:36] <%Livelinne> VENDING MACHINE!!
[2:36:42] <%ToneBacas> you're not locked in with them, they're locked in with you!
[2:36:50] <%GeneralSCPatton> I want to see pacifist runs
[2:36:52] <$lotharrio> Rude of him.
[2:36:59] <StrawberryBandit> welp
[2:37:02] <featherlan> I'd become a biomass goo-monster. I could just cram my mass INTO a robo-body. Get the cake AND eat it too
[2:37:07] <+Pendragwn> @HollowDragon231 but he is already biomass
[2:37:12] <Davimotion96> look at those adorable little dreadnoughts LuvBlush LuvBlush LuvBlush

[2:48:48] <%Starotter70> Does it make Chicken Noises?
[2:48:51] <HollowDragon231> Why does Yog-Sathoth sound like a chicken?
[2:48:52] <$Caped_Eggy> That dude was just taking a shit
[2:48:54] <%toolofparanoia> That reminded me of the scene from the animatrix where that guy gets ripped out of the mech suit by the robots
[2:48:54] <%abrupt_abe> floeHoldDat floeHoldDat
[2:48:55] <HollowDragon231> Yes
[2:48:57] <%marsantas> The worst thing is you're destroying all their toilets
[2:48:59] <+jmcclellan18> Pat have you ever seen the movie "The Thing" It's my favorite horror film and this seems inspired by it.
[2:49:02] <HollowDragon231> That's the stock chicken noise I swear
[2:49:02] <Onatamana> you can tell you're in a new place because there are people that haven't been horribly murdered
[2:49:03] <%Starotter70> psaCaw
[2:49:04] <+Carquar> So when are they making this into a live action movie staring Dwayne Johnson
[2:49:10] <ha2ken> Boss fight?
[2:49:23] <HollowDragon231> Genuinely surprised you aren't actually going up the toilet and getting them through it
[2:49:44] <%Cozy90> @jmcclellan18 yes. its one of the best horror movies ever.
[2:49:47] <%StarlingSilence> I like the rupturefarms style LED messages
[2:49:48] <laguerrilha> Oh shit is that the city??
[2:49:49] <%SGrim> This area is under quarantine. Unfortunately, this is the United States. doodSick
[2:49:49] <%arancet> @jmcclellan18 seen it? he made a commentary track for it
[2:50:02] <%LiquidDinosaur> who did
[2:50:03] <%LiquidDinosaur> pat?
[2:50:08] <%ToneBacas> chew your food before you swallow
[2:50:09] <%Shockrates20XX> Any reason to leave them alive?
[2:50:11] <+jmcclellan18> oh my bad I didn't know that. I will check it out!
[2:50:15] <%LiquidDinosaur> i gotta watch that
[2:50:18] <+PunkZedB> who designs a facility that has doors that open when the drone guards are destroyed?
[2:50:19] <%Cozy90> is this the covid?
[2:50:24] <theanora1> you think there's a pacifist ending to this game?
[2:50:26] <laguerrilha> Boss?
[2:50:27] <%arancet> its on plagues channel
[2:50:31] <JayEarly> @shockrates20xx to save them for later?
[2:50:32] <%GeneralSCPatton> @carquar There was the movie Life, which is similar enough.
[2:50:36] <%LiquidDinosaur> @PunkZedB the Nemoidians in Star Wars
[2:50:41] <%Arazien> American Quarantines are completely optional apparently.
[2:50:43] <%Starotter70> THE ULTIMATE BIO MASS
[2:50:53] <HollowDragon231> K'AREN
[2:51:00] <%GeneralSCPatton> @theanora1 I give it at least 50% chance of pacifist ending.
[2:51:11] <HollowDragon231> CARRION VS K'AREN who wins?
[2:51:20] <%ToneBacas> imagine this thing attacks your home
[2:51:28] <+Pinkiefan> Lol that would be terrifying.
[2:51:33] <Onatamana> tfw the horrific fleshbeast slaps you with a metal grate
[2:51:34] <%bevyrage> most states have optional quarantines yes
[2:51:34] <%Starotter70> It sounds like the Mincraft Eating noise when noming
[2:51:42] <+Jaysky> What if all Karen's are infected BY the Carrion?
[2:51:50] <xanderfist> Pat did you like xbox thing?
[2:51:51] <+Jaysky> That would explain why there's so many
[2:51:56] <+Loinclothiclese> Is this carrion Italian? LUL
[2:51:57] <%maenos2> so in my dnd homebrew I have a creature called a cairner. my players immediately took to calling them Karen's.
[2:52:00] <%Livelinne> pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat pastaThat
[2:52:04] <+Pinkiefan> Seeing the two people in front be smushed by a tenticle, then the whole thing rushes in.
[2:52:21] <groganleer> This is actually just like ender's game, pat's actively helping carrion free into Seattle
[2:52:24] <%marsantas> I smell bitch
[2:52:30] <%toolofparanoia> Would be great if there was a carrion that just ate Karens

[2:58:09] <%Cozy90> @MaritimeSpanker plot wise you missed not much though
[2:58:19] <+Aniki_Tony> Kaiju Carrior
[2:58:30] <kiwicoffin> Rule of threes
[2:58:33] <theanora1> depends on how short the game is
[2:58:34] <Hydrapissed> 2 is the loneliest number
[2:58:36] <%valkuma> I REALLY HATE WORMS MODE
[2:58:36] <+the22cstomp> memory chamber
[2:58:41] <%Cozy90> @MaritimeSpanker there was a possible flashbackto a dude wandering around looking through here but nione of us are sure what it meant
[2:58:42] <Daxalog> Mario only regularly gets 2 sizes
[2:58:43] <%VashyronM> How's the game?
[2:58:58] <+Aniki_Tony> he gets fire flower tho
[2:58:58] <%Metballs> Man, I really want to rewatch The Thing now
[2:58:59] <AnneSQF> he has the fire power up as the third
[2:59:00] <rosemon5001> containment unit means the extra ability hidden in the area
[2:59:01] <+evbites> Mario has 4
[2:59:01] <%dave323dave> how dare you
[2:59:02] <%CJett92> Mario has 3
[2:59:02] <gamewarden92> D:
[2:59:02] <kozboz96> no mario has a 3rd giant size
[2:59:04] <%Typhaeon> oh no the lone survivor
[2:59:05] <+Mohanoman> they made a megashroom
[2:59:06] <%JenovasPuppet> Mario gets small, large and fire flower
[2:59:07] <MaritimeSpanker> that's good, atleat
[2:59:08] <%CJett92> Small, Big, and Power Up
[2:59:12] <+evbites> tiny big short and tall
[2:59:13] <Ultralazuli> I suppose? like that character from rezero?
[2:59:13] <laguerrilha> Doesnt the other Mario powers count as well? Like tanuki or fire form?
[2:59:16] <+Stonehewer> I love that they played the last 15 minutes of Inside, and said, "Let's just make that the whole game"
[2:59:16] <+Geneaux> what are biosamples
[2:59:20] <%Typhaeon> The tanuki suit means his balls have a third size
[2:59:24] <MaritimeSpanker> game seems really cool, wanted to check out how it seemed to play before I bought it
[2:59:25] <+Aniki_Tony> hey buddy open the door pls

[3:00:54] <+Pinkiefan> Probably. It's not long.
[3:00:55] <GhostAnimals> Isn't this supposed to be like 5-6 hours long?
[3:00:58] <+the22cstomp> i sure hope so
[3:00:58] <%Cozy90> oof that hurt alot
[3:00:58] <%Typhaeon> Why would a wooden palette stop this thing
[3:01:00] <HealingMind> This game has some strange Oddworld vibes to it. It feels like if Abe had a gun at all times.
[3:01:01] <%ToneBacas> aw sick!
[3:01:05] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Do you think carrion monster could do the Big Five?
[3:01:11] <haisho> I don't imagine this to be particularly long
[3:01:12] <laguerrilha> Is this the Zerg origin story?
[3:01:14] <chambatron> Shoot flame
[3:01:22] <%StarlingSilence> There's def oddworld influence, i'm digging it
[3:01:32] <+taren817> Now that I think about it this is likely the power that the monster was using in the game's animated trailer that came out yesterday
[3:01:46] <%LiquidDinosaur> which power the possession?
[3:01:48] <+mMayrro> holy shit that's fucked up
[3:01:52] <%silverira> !uptime
[3:01:53] <+TheBitingIrish> KAPOW
[3:01:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 2m.
[3:01:56] <+TheBitingIrish> Oops
[3:01:58] <%StarlingSilence> oh shit
[3:01:59] <$lotharrio> Oh if you leave corpses, can you just keep possessing them?
[3:02:02] <+Aniki_Tony> power!

[3:02:43] <%jjolion> Carrion the hedgehog
[3:02:47] <%Brojira> SPikey boy from spikey gang
[3:02:49] <Onatamana> touch of death
[3:02:50] <Billli11> sonic

[3:03:11] <JakeJong> Jesus that is cool as heck
[3:03:24] <+Loinclothiclese> @dukenux well yea if you get blasted to bits and lose all your bio ass
[3:03:25] <kiwicoffin> There's something cute about this horror creature
[3:03:33] <Onatamana> y those guys got antenna
[3:03:38] <+mMayrro> juked!
[3:03:41] <Guardiansaiyan> FELLOW HUMANS
[3:03:44] <%dekkitout> Here's hoping Karrion Cassidy gets enough spines to summon Knull
[3:03:46] <+Loinclothiclese> @kiwicoffin cmonBruh
[3:03:59] <jorniev> WHAT
[3:04:05] <ha2ken> That biomass must be carrying all sorts of diseases with all that contact
[3:04:29] <Miikaaeeel> How are the controls?
[3:04:30] <%ChaosAethr> you left your mass
[3:04:32] <+Loinclothiclese> @ha2ken i think thats the least of anyones worries with that bitch rushing you down LUL
[3:04:34] <%maenos2> the omega std
[3:04:35] <%ToneBacas> what if Elmo is the carrion?
[3:04:42] <+sixcubit> so is this on an alien planet or what
[3:04:47] <Onatamana> Diseases don't matter if you murdalize everything you come in contact with
[3:04:53] <%ZeOrbling> im still confused what depositing biomass does, i came in late
[3:04:56] <+Pinkiefan> Seattle
[3:05:02] <%maenos2> @sixcubit I mean if you count Seattle another planet
[3:05:03] <GhostAnimals> Who cares if parts of you are coated in disease when you can just.... Not have that part of you any more.
[3:05:06] <%Livelinne> Elmo C.A.T.
[3:05:07] <+Pinkiefan> Changes moveset
[3:05:10] <RzdAkira> I guess in a way this is a metroidvania huh
[3:05:12] <$lotharrio> @ZeOrbling It lowers his overall biomass and lets him use other powers.
[3:05:13] <%holydeviant1> Swaps forms, small boy can cloak, web
[3:05:13] <haisho> whaaaaat
[3:05:15] <%Mendin> Certain abilities are size-gated
[3:05:15] <%VashyronM> @ZeOrbling Makes you smaller
[3:05:16] <%SGrim> @sixcubit it's the most alien location ever. Seattle, Washington.
[3:05:17] <%LiquidDinosaur> @ZeOrbling becoming smaller lets you move faster, slip into tighter spots and turn invisible.
[3:05:23] <$lotharrio> Also could be used to long term store HP.
[3:05:25] <Onatamana> @ZeOrbling certain abilities are locked into certain amounts of biomass
[3:05:29] <+a_c_chirns> wait now you're a dude?
[3:05:30] <+YabbaTroll> a jail?
[3:05:39] <%ZeOrbling> oh cool, much more mechanically involved than i assumed
[3:05:42] <Billli11> the coworker is dead
[3:05:49] <%ToneBacas> @ZeOrbling some abilities only work if you're normal size vs big, so you can drop biomass to get small
[3:05:52] <SjoeB89> IS this getting to anyone else's creepy OCD vibe?
[3:05:55] <Tennochief> flashback
[3:05:55] <gamewarden92> dead on the floor
[3:06:50] <Saltmeisterr> hello
[3:06:58] <HorribleHog> big flashback vibes
[3:07:00] <%LiquidDinosaur> dont taze me bro
[3:07:05] <+mMayrro> oh poor robot has no gun
[3:07:24] <Tennochief> LUL
[3:07:29] <kiwicoffin> The stun gun seems like a weapon from the original game before some genius said play as the monster
[3:07:30] <%Typhaeon> Nice pop gun
[3:07:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> why is this robot attacking a human
[3:07:49] <%Livelinne> That’s a tether gun
[3:07:53] <BoneofMalkav> cohhAim cohhAim cohhAim
[3:07:53] <Guardiansaiyan> @LiquidDinosaur he touched the sample
[3:07:55] <haisho> oh god was the monster a dude?
[3:07:55] <+YabbaTroll> is the human a human?
[3:07:56] <%Mendin> It was broken
[3:08:00] <%ToneBacas> he's so strong
[3:08:00] <%shadowace2400> so why are you a guy now?
[3:08:01] <KaiserMario> Is that James Rolfe?
[3:08:05] <Tennochief> yes
[3:08:07] <%JenovasPuppet> Either robot malfunction, or human infected.
[3:08:16] <Tennochief> it's a flashback
[3:08:20] <Guardiansaiyan> @JenovasPuppet infection
[3:08:25] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Guardiansaiyan so he's already infected? (its otally the blob right?)
[3:08:25] <%Typhaeon> What happened to the other 2 guys who do the heavy looking on?
[3:08:27] <Onatamana> yo can we have a multiplayer humans vs spaghetti monster the pieces are all here
[3:08:35] <KaiserMario> a "fleshback"
[3:08:48] <laguerrilha> wait where are the other 2?
[3:08:51] <%StarlingSilence> escapo
[3:08:52] <+Aniki_Tony> 0.0
[3:08:53] <+Aniki_Tony> OHhhh
[3:08:54] <Guardiansaiyan> @LiquidDinosaur it might be a sample of an alien
[3:08:55] <rosemon5001> attack them you wont
[3:08:56] <%Typhaeon> Oh shi
[3:08:56] <%ToneBacas> it knows!

[3:09:23] <%Livelinne> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[3:09:25] <%toolofparanoia> I get it now... Those are memories
[3:09:27] <KaiserMario> "Carrion my wayward son"
[3:09:27] <%JenovasPuppet> I wonder if you have to die there
[3:09:29] <MaritimeSpanker> the carrion just wants to start a new life on the coast of new zealand, and fuck a gal
[3:09:30] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Guardiansaiyan no but like, that guy then grew into the blob you are now?
[3:09:31] <laguerrilha> Carrion wayward son
[3:09:32] <BoneofMalkav> Carrion my Wayword Son
[3:09:32] <kiwicoffin> No more than two carrions
[3:09:34] <ha2ken> It became carry out
[3:09:40] <kozboz96> ohboy
[3:09:40] <Onatamana> meltdown incoming
[3:09:43] <jorniev> WOOOW
[3:09:44] <%Typhaeon> You must MUTATE
[3:09:45] <+YabbaTroll> time to eat some uranium
[3:09:45] <%dekkitout> @Estuko A cool symbiote from entering my bloodstream
[3:09:46] <%maenos2> oh deae
[3:09:46] <+Aniki_Tony> time to be nuclear
[3:09:46] <%ToneBacas> @Estuko my endoskeleton
[3:09:46] <%JenovasPuppet> Nucular
[3:09:46] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> YEAH
[3:09:47] <Guardiansaiyan> @LiquidDinosaur maybe? we need more lore
[3:09:47] <%Mendin> OH BOY
[3:09:49] <$lotharrio> Maybe you'll get fire breath from this area.
[3:09:50] <%SGrim> @Estuko the constraints of my pathetic mortal form octoSad
[3:09:50] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> YEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[3:09:58] <ThatButler> "By Kojima Productions"
[3:10:08] <%Typhaeon> Those spikes are brutal!
[3:10:09] <%Livelinne> sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn sbfpSetIn
[3:10:11] <BoneofMalkav> Who's ready for legit Nuclear Meltdown!?
[3:10:11] <+Pinkiefan> Get big!
[3:10:13] <+deviljhojho_> nice
[3:10:15] <%joylent_blue> monkaS
[3:10:18] <KasiCrafter> Huh, it's a big ol' generator. Why would--OH NO
[3:10:29] <AFlyingTaco1> Damn, I wanna play this but it's gotta download first. Guess I'll just play Fable 2 until then.
[3:10:42] <MaritimeSpanker> why fable 2?
[3:10:45] <+Plaguemelon> monkaS Chat I'm getting hungry
[3:10:46] <+Estuko> @dekkitout @ToneBacas @SGrim cranky5Pat all acceptable excuses, someday we'll all become part of the Carrion and enjoy endless lust and hungry as we feed on every creature
[3:10:48] <+Loinclothiclese> @KasiCrafter because the title to the place is nuclear facility.....
[3:10:48] <Jaghatai> Can someone summarize the plot so far?
[3:10:54] <MaritimeSpanker> or rather, why fable?
[3:10:54] <%joylent_blue> hell yeah fable 2
[3:10:56] <Hegelundra> dont forget about the spikes!
[3:10:58] <+mMayrro> time to go back to every place there was one of those now :)
[3:11:08] <Onatamana> the meat must be smaller
[3:11:09] <+Loinclothiclese> @Jaghatai biomass eat kill escape
[3:11:12] <KasiCrafter> Nono. It's for *energy*.
[3:11:16] <%Stonebeard> @Jaghatai spaghetti goes rogue
[3:11:19] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jaghatai You are a flesh monster who does big om noms
[3:11:19] <%dekkitout> TBH- I'd rather be a Mecha-Carrion
[3:11:22] <KasiCrafter> Which is what MonkaS is about it
[3:11:25] <rosemon5001> ohhh you can go back and kick that one thing out of the way aswell
[3:11:25] <%joylent_blue> MaritimeSpanker i guess because a Fable reboot was teased during the microsoft thing
[3:11:33] <+pectusumbra> ah damn it, two amazing streams at once, WHAT DO
[3:11:44] <%StaceMcGate> Pat starts calling taking a shit "dumping biomass"
[3:11:44] <MaritimeSpanker> huh
[3:11:50] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Jaghatai also some flashbacks of being a human who gets exposed to a sample of red goo and then their security devices flag him as a threat and he's killed. implicitly he became the blob
[3:12:04] <Tennochief> BETRAYAL
[3:12:13] <+YabbaTroll> yikes
[3:12:14] <RzdAkira> So fucked up
[3:12:14] <+a_c_chirns> jesus
[3:12:18] <%maenos2> jesus
[3:12:21] <%JVolfram> Become the biomass you want to see in the world
[3:12:22] <theanora1> killed on the toilet
[3:12:24] <+taren817> Ah, nothing like a good workplace shooting
[3:12:26] <+Estuko> This is so dark and terrifying lol
[3:12:27] <Tennochief> Boy that is even more horrifying than the manoster
[3:12:27] <%StarlingSilence> oof
[3:12:29] <kiwicoffin> Just normal human things, like shooting innocents
[3:12:31] <AFlyingTaco1> @stacemcgate Why would you do this. Now he's gonna call it that. Oh god oh fuck
[3:12:33] <%abrupt_abe> It feels darker walking in and shooting them while helpless then it does eating them
[3:12:36] <HopIophobia> ORDER: Shoot anything that moves and displays suspicious activity. monkaS
[3:12:41] <ThatButler> wait a second, these are mind control tentacles, these are genticles!
[3:12:49] <%maenos2> good work pat
[3:12:54] <Onatamana> do you think the people spaghetti monster hijacks are conscious of what's happening to them
[3:13:11] <Hawajiggaba> If the trailer is any indication, yes.
[3:13:15] <%holydeviant1> @Onatamana the trailer implies they are
[3:13:17] <%Mendin> Pat can you get in and chestburster the armored guys' corpses for more food?
[3:13:18] <RinWR> I hope they are
[3:13:19] <+TopTieramisu> how's the game so far?
[3:13:24] <%arancet> oh shit, that crossfire game was by remedy?
[3:13:33] <Guardiansaiyan> @Onatamana depends on if they take the consciousness or just eats them all leaving or absobing nothing
[3:13:35] <%GeneralSCPatton> @onatamana The trailer did have a guy start crying as he began to explode into the Carrion.
[3:13:35] <%dekkitout> Better question, how bad -or good- does the possession feel
[3:13:37] <+Loinclothiclese> @Mendin no
[3:13:38] <Onatamana> @holydeviant1 oh joy
[3:13:42] <%Dingus_Tickler> Dingus_Tickler subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 42 months, currently on a 42 month streak! atpOld
[3:13:47] <%Mendin> aw, rip
[3:13:57] <Guardiansaiyan> @dekkitout if its a buddy game then good...if its for use only then bad
[3:14:01] <+Pinkiefan> Where can a fleshbeast get some biomass at 11:30 pm?
[3:14:02] <Tennochief> Human Fear! Delicious
[3:14:04] <kiwicoffin> The way you just slide through the environment is something special
[3:14:06] <+Loinclothiclese> @arancet no its not, theyre helping do the story mode for it not making the game.
[3:14:14] <%Typhaeon> Hey flush your biomass you pig
[3:14:15] <+KoyoTheBoyo> if I was a giant thing monster, i wouldn't bother killing people, id just be really good at tekken tbh
[3:14:18] <%JVolfram> Become thicc
[3:14:45] <%holydeviant1> Giant thing monster becomes a shockingly decent hololive streamer
[3:15:01] <unclekulikov> Carrion: Become Human unlocked
[3:15:17] <chambatron> Normie?
[3:15:17] <laguerrilha> the worms i water one are still the most fucked one for me
[3:15:18] <%dekkitout> FIRE BAD D:
[3:15:23] <Guardiansaiyan> @unclekulikov if a fat evil is the final boss THEN we will know
[3:15:29] <%Mendin> Goddammit holydeviantart now I'm just imagining Korone screaming as she spaghettis around
[3:15:31] <%holydeviant1> I love how fire stays so relevant
[3:15:38] <+Estuko> Imagine having your fav hololive stream dancing half naked for you only to say "I? I am a monument to all your sinssss.."
[3:15:39] <Guardiansaiyan> @chambatron no one on this channel is a normie
[3:15:41] <%joylent_blue> why are the humans so mean BibleThump
[3:15:42] <slagothor> dont ofrget yoru spikes
[3:15:42] <haisho> AGH FLAMMENWERFER
[3:15:45] <Hegelundra> @PatStaresAt dont forget about the spikes
[3:15:45] <%maenos2> fire BAD
[3:15:48] <%Razputin217> BURNING
[3:15:50] <%Littlecjmajor> fire bad pat
[3:15:51] <rosemon5001> chat has he gotten any of the extra abilitys?
[3:15:51] <%SGrim> If only Pat remembered the instant kill spikes
[3:15:52] <%MidnightBurst12> shit just got real
[3:15:54] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> when is Korone playing this?
[3:15:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> @estuko I can only get so erect
[3:15:59] <Guardiansaiyan> @joylent_blue they have forgotten friendship
[3:16:03] <+Spice_bubble> Humans prevail PogChamp
[3:16:06] <%notgarza> That stinger
[3:16:07] <%holydeviant1> This game is just Gravemind: The Early Years
[3:16:12] <%LiquidDinosaur> @holydeviant1 maybe Taneesha will call your blbg-ass if she ever stop devouring' with that brain surgeon or lawyer she been consuming
[3:16:15] <graemecrackers2> fire bad
[3:16:15] <Parapattern> He did not hesitate to torch his friends ass
[3:16:22] <T_Sasquatch> It burnnssss
[3:16:24] <%Typhaeon> Dig Dug his ass
[3:16:24] <%LiquidDinosaur> @holydeviant1 oops Blob-ass*
[3:16:28] <+Pinkiefan> Sets beast on fire, beast rushes toward them.
[3:16:31] <%joylent_blue> have they even tried to just TALK to the Carrion monster FeelsBadMan
[3:16:56] <GingerSen> if this was an SCP breah, honestly this would be a ALPHA Warhead situation right here
[3:17:13] <%dekkitout> They always ask "What is Carrion?" but never "How is Carrion?"
[3:17:29] <Tennochief> Carrion's a fucking jerk
[3:17:34] <%LiquidDinosaur> @GingerSen they'd have flamethrowers and machine gun all around the cell too
[3:17:37] <%Mendin> I mean Carrion's comin out of his cage and he's been doing just fine
[3:17:38] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dekkitout HOMGRY. SEND MORE FOODS.
[3:17:40] <OlavOlavsson> Carrion is all about that body positivity
[3:17:44] <Tennochief> He ate my wife and dind't even say "Thanks for the meal"
[3:17:48] <+Pinkiefan> @dekkitout I think they mostly just scream and die.
[3:17:49] <%Dakuu75> Keter Class
[3:17:56] <Tennochief> how rude
[3:18:02] <thetruthofyourbeing> The thing wants Cummies
[3:18:04] <+PleasantLee> mind control noodle perhaps?
[3:18:08] <%MidnightBurst12> gotta bulk up
[3:18:22] <GingerSen> Look at these amateurs trying to contain this thing, pfff
[3:18:56] <%LiquidDinosaur> why contain it
[3:19:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> !uptime
[3:19:02] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 19m.
[3:19:10] <%Cozy90> they would need to activate halo to get rid of this thing
[3:19:21] <%ToneBacas> clever tentacle monster
[3:19:25] <%joylent_blue> the Carrion was what we were meant to be all along
[3:19:28] <GingerSen> at first it was contain, but its for sure not secured, nor protected
[3:19:31] <%SGrim> BrainSlug
[3:19:31] <kiwicoffin> This is an "activate the ring" sort of creature
[3:19:35] <%LiquidDinosaur> @Cozy90 oh dont overreact its not even turning every victim into an incubator
[3:19:36] <+robobeau> Does that map spell a prhase??
[3:19:38] <%joylent_blue> embrace the Carrion
[3:19:41] <%DappercatEsquire> Have they tried putting a plastic cup on top of the Carrion monster and then sliding a piece of paper under the cup to trap it?
[3:19:43] <+robobeau> I swear I saw letters
[3:19:43] <+HoodieWheats> Goopiest pat
[3:19:47] <%Dakuu75> throw it at 682 and see what happens
[3:19:48] <%StaceMcGate> SPREAD THE TAINT
[3:19:57] <vulpuspictus> Is this what Pat's shower drain looks like?
[3:20:03] <Tennochief> wow
[3:20:07] <GingerSen> 682 would fuse with it and then were fuk
[3:20:08] <thetruthofyourbeing> Would the scp foundation even contain this thing?
[3:20:11] <Ipsenscastle> @DappercatEsquire that's using your noggin
[3:20:13] <Tennochief> fucking cut him in half with a grate
[3:20:23] <T_Sasquatch> Im impressed by how fluid yet disgusting the movement looks
[3:20:36] <+mMayrro> imagine being such a huge loser that a grate cuts you in half LUL
[3:20:45] <Parapattern> Seeing as how the US government utterly failed to contain something like Corona, I am not at all confident that they'd be able to contain any SCP monstrosities
[3:20:46] <GingerSen> Scp would have a better chance, as they would not leave things to chance for things like that. They would nuke the place by now considering how much it has spread.
[3:20:47] <+TheBitingIrish> It honestly doesn't seem too durable, SCP would probably just incinerate it

[3:21:34] <%GeneralSCPatton> @dakuu75 682 kills it. Because it is not immune to basic physical damage, and 682 can adapt to being deleted by a reality warper.
[3:21:43] <%Mendin> @maenos2 It means "fleshy"

[3:23:47] <+taren817> IS THAT A NUKE
[3:23:48] <GingerSen> oh look a deadmans core
[3:23:51] <Bust_ER> was that the fucking demon core
[3:23:52] <KasiCrafter> The generator is for POWER
[3:23:52] <%Mendin> GET THE URANIUMS
[3:23:53] <shruke> uhhhhh
[3:23:53] <%Arazien> Carrion just got bodied by a pistol and people want to pit it against 682 lol

[3:24:06] <laguerrilha> Oh wow its really intelligent
[3:24:12] <haisho> why the fuck are their generators powered by fucking DEMON CORES
[3:24:14] <+YabbaTroll> well 682 doesnt have a pistol now does he?
[3:24:16] <VritraReiRei> Does this game have a map? I cant tell
[3:24:17] <Parapattern> The Goose from the goose game combined with this guy
[3:24:19] <%Cozy90> DRINK THAT COKE
[3:24:31] <%dekkitout> Carrion could drop a beryllium core and shrug it off
[3:24:41] <GingerSen> need more mass for that ass
[3:24:41] <Naho_Saenoki> @VritraReiRei Why would a mutant meat creature have a map?
[3:24:44] <%GeneralSCPatton> @tomserval 682 will eventually adapt to anything, including undeleting itself after a reality warper erases it from existence. It also hates all life. Also, a popular headcanon is that it has a memetic effect of making everyone obsessed with finding a way to kill it.

[3:25:26] <%abrupt_abe> Biomass is a great word
[3:25:26] <%joylent_blue> its amazingly disgusting
[3:25:43] <%maenos2> fucking demon core...

[3:26:39] <%GeneralSCPatton> @victorious_drago A being claiming to be god and having apparent omnipotence literally took no responsibility for 682 existing. Whatever it is, it came from somewhere else.
[3:26:40] <thetruthofyourbeing> SO HUGE
[3:26:41] <GingerSen> he is the flying spaghetti monster
[3:26:52] <%Cozy90> omg an EA money search simulator is too accurate

[3:35:18] <$lotharrio> Who wins? Carrion, or one spooky boner boi with nothing to lose?
[3:35:19] <stabbityrabbit> I was more meaning how would you accurately depict its playstyle. It has a very unique form of movement before getting to its abilities.
[3:35:27] <%Dakuu75> is Carrion's natural predator jsut another Carrion that's made only of skeletons?
[3:35:44] <%dekkitout> @lotharrio They'd fuse into something... more...

[3:45:12] <Wan6Saber> @StaceMcGate that owuld be justice!
[3:45:12] <raikagelord1> Keratin can be a lot of things.
[3:45:19] <+taren817> Good thing you stored all that biomass
[3:45:22] <%JenovasPuppet> Once again, mechs no problem, but pistols = death
[3:45:28] <ThatButler> Interesting thing though....You don't exactly lose mass when you die, the bits that get shot turn into worms and wander away.
[3:45:32] <jorniev> what is keratin?
[3:45:37] <Zombrocom> This thing is suprisingly weak to bullets
[3:45:40] <%LiquidDinosaur> what button is keratosis
[3:45:40] <kiwicoffin> quills, rhino horns, pangolin scales
[3:45:45] <+BurningLlama777> @LiquidDinosaur Cats know that the gods are angry with us
[3:45:46] <%StaceMcGate> @Wan6Saber what was even the point of the last 7 years then?
[3:45:52] <%MidnightBurst12> cool
[3:45:52] <%LiquidDinosaur> @jorniev the stuff fingernails and horns on animals are made of
[3:45:55] <+RowenCleric> keratin is in chitnous shells too
[3:45:56] <+LikeARyder> brrrrrrrrrrr
[3:46:01] <%Jack_of_No_Trades> Finger nails, also I think insect exoskeleton
[3:46:01] <Releasedahoundz> kerr to touch deez nuts
[3:46:07] <+Aniki_Tony> that was pretty dumn lol
[3:46:07] <%DedlokPM> @jorniev hair, fingernails, and toenails are all made out of keratin
[3:46:09] <%joylent_blue> what was that dudes plan there
[3:46:10] <Wan6Saber> @StaceMcGate just him on vacation ohaiShrug
[3:46:11] <%JenovasPuppet> Why don't they just make the whole mech out of the shield material?
[3:46:12] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:46:12] <ThatButler> Keratin is basically what your finger nails are made of
[3:46:17] <+evbites> who charges the meat
[3:46:21] <EMP_SaltyMan> I wonder can you grow a shield then dash attack
[3:46:25] <jorniev> GROOOOOSSS
[3:46:32] <%Dakuu75> animals horns are made of Keratin too
[3:46:32] <jorniev> this game is AWESOME
[3:46:35] <%joylent_blue> evbites lmao
[3:46:36] <%dekkitout> Horns, hooves, chitin, hair, and the such are keratin
[3:46:38] <raikagelord1> Keratin is the shit and wish we could make claws and scales.
[3:46:46] <%GeneralSCPatton> @thatbutler I think the worms die when they separate. You need a whole upgrade just to function as a worm swarm, and it only works in water.
[3:46:54] <ha2ken> Is Earth just Carrion? One big biomass?
[3:46:57] <+PunkZedB> when are you going to fight a blue flesh monster while in the rain?
[3:46:58] <OneThousandTomatoes> makes sure the plate is clean
[3:47:00] <+deviljhojho_> big boy
[3:47:02] <+MrTurtleThief> Thats one THICC ass blob
[3:47:07] <ThatButler> It might be a hivemind sort of deal,
[3:47:11] <%LiquidDinosaur> why dont the bombs hurt you
[3:47:12] <%StarlingSilence> keratin is a protein that makes up our fingernails etc. chitin is the analogue in bugs, except that's a polymer
[3:47:12] <$joylent_blue> big brain PogChamp
[3:47:13] <T_Sasquatch> Im confused . Why aren't THEY on high alert
[3:47:15] <%SGrim> BRAIN BIG doodDerp
[3:47:19] <ThatButler> so together they're a mass, but alone, they worms
[3:47:28] <kiwicoffin> @LiquidDinosaur new armor upgrade
[3:47:31] <raikagelord1> @thatbutler that is what I have gathered.
[3:47:33] <%Psyramics> The worms slither away, so I would assume once disconnected they're just dumb worms
[3:47:40] <chambatron> uwu
[3:47:41] <%joylent_blue> keratin armor too good to get exploded
[3:47:42] <Wan6Saber> sounds like the Hunters from Halo, but more wild
