[0:23:52] <saiyanblitz> Motorcycles
[0:23:53] <BleedinActionMan> Oh, yeah, be careful not to get in a head on crash, or you'll die instantly
[0:23:53] <%ssjklyco> So platinum
[0:23:54] <%BoxNavy> sega and capcom
[0:23:56] <+loukemia83> Bayo is a Yakuza?
[0:23:59] <UltimateDomon> and then Sega didnt even want to make the sequel
[0:24:00] <%TalisKanju> I hope Bayonetta 3, if it exists, actually has a Space Harrier sequence
[0:24:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> Given Platnum used to be sega and capcom based no surprise
[0:24:13] <Broken_Sonex> Well i mean, it's got the fucking Sonic rings
[0:24:18] <Daxalog> oh
[0:24:20] <DagetStreams> Give Platinum money and they'll give you the best fanservice your company's ever had
[0:24:20] <majindusto> So...Can you play othe sega songs? (Like sonic?)
[0:24:21] <%BoxNavy> oh...
[0:24:21] <+fetrigon> LUL
[0:24:22] <PrinceOfEden> F
[0:24:23] <Saltmeisterr> THE SHADOW
[0:24:25] <Vyskus> Bayonetta fucking died
[0:24:26] <+TheotherKristian> I hope Bayo 3 has a yakuza reference, for some reason
[0:24:27] <justinjones1989> yeah get fucked
[0:24:27] <BleedinActionMan> What did I tell ya
[0:24:28] <UltimateDomon> Best part of Bayo 1
[0:24:31] <UltimateDomon> All the instant kills
[0:24:31] <+fetrigon> git gud
[0:24:32] <bakkatohri> REMAINS CAST
[0:24:33] <%walternatorz> who knew driving into opposing traffic was dangerous?
[0:24:35] <Daxalog> I cant believe Bayo wiped out on the freeway
[0:24:37] <NitronStreams> Guess is still somewhat borked cuz I didnt get any notification
[0:24:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> BTW WHEN IS THE PC PORT OF ANARCHY REIGNS!
[0:24:40] <+I_Rafiki_x> wear a helmet Bayo
[0:24:43] <%RetroCop87> HYAAT
[0:24:47] <BerryliciousDefinition> f
[0:24:49] <%AzureGale> AND I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE LAUGHING
[0:24:51] <DagetStreams> Can't wait to see Platinum make Stadia fanservice
[0:24:59] <+CannonHeroBrett> SourPls
[0:25:03] <BleedinActionMan> Also, MadWorld is never getting a remaster, probably
[0:25:04] <%AzureGale> BETWEEN EACH SMILE THERE'S A TEAR IN YOUR EYE
[0:25:04] <Vyskus> Would Bayonetta's hair count as a helmet
[0:25:09] <%Dementedpenguin> Reminder that After Burner Climax made it to consoles because Hideki wanted to play it LUL
[0:25:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> Did you?
[0:25:15] <+TheotherKristian> yes
[0:25:17] <+fetrigon> pats for patrick
[0:25:18] <%AzureGale> THERE'S A TRAIN LEAVING TOWN IN AN HOUR
[0:25:22] <%arcielardor> hey Pat, what's that earbud brand you and Woolie keep hawking?
[0:25:24] <bakkatohri> The one time I played Stadia to play through their platform exclusive, Gylt.... It was kinda okay... Could be better tho
[0:25:27] <%AzureGale> IT'S NOT WAITING FOR YOU AND NEITHER AM I
[0:25:28] <%RetroCop87> I LOVE BIG BLUE
[0:25:29] <%BoxNavy> i was hoping youd miss it
[0:25:33] <%BoxNavy> as a joke
[0:25:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> NOW DRIVE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC
[0:25:39] <+fetrigon> @arcielardor rayconn
[0:25:45] <PrinceOfEden> F
[0:25:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK THIS ROAD IN PARTICULAR
[0:25:48] <justinjones1989> Bayo 1 has a lot of instadeath, glad they addressed that in Bayo 2
[0:25:49] <%BoxNavy> SICK
[0:25:49] <notorious_rng> wrong side
[0:25:50] <huskarl_zap> bayonetta never killed anyone
[0:25:54] <+Partialrecall2> Curious... she doesn't even use a bayonette as a weapon... Checkmate Liberals. - Turning Point USA
[0:25:54] <Darkdrill> oh noo
[0:25:58] <Darkdrill> F
[0:25:59] <%KineKithZen> Raekwon Kappa
[0:26:00] <%walternatorz> cars are stronger than angels
[0:26:03] <%Movemeister> pat truly needs the wings of fire
[0:26:05] <%BoxNavy> thats fine jermaPluto
[0:26:07] <%RetroCop87> Enzo drives better than you Pat
[0:26:07] <%the22cstomp> pat just dont get hit
[0:26:10] <Broken_Sonex> Bro i just saw this crazy bitch wipe out on the freeway.
[0:26:11] <justinjones1989> bayer-nutter
[0:26:20] <%AzureGale> I mean, if you collided with a car head-on on a motorcycle in real life it would probably one-shot you
[0:26:22] <+TheotherKristian> Don't worry, those humans were insured
[0:26:24] <%arcielardor> thanks @fetrigon
[0:26:26] <%walternatorz> I totally believe Pat.
[0:26:27] <%BoxNavy> you suuuuure were
[0:26:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LYING
[0:26:44] <Profmcstevie> I too am immensely impressive when no one is looking
[0:26:45] <%walternatorz> (I don't believe him.)
[0:26:46] <Vyskus> I believe you :)
[0:26:55] <%BoxNavy> thats pat
[0:26:56] <+Partialrecall2> wat platform he playing on? pc port of this worth it?
[0:26:56] <SCIENCE_25> Oh yeah of course Pat.
[0:26:57] <majindusto> OFF-SCREEN GRINDING
[0:27:00] <Broken_Sonex> I will pretend to believe you Pat
[0:27:11] <%Broand> man I suck ass at this game
[0:27:29] <%Dementedpenguin> What.
[0:27:30] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:27:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt When?
[0:27:39] <DagetStreams> Yeah that's my excuse to
[0:27:42] <DagetStreams> o
[0:27:45] <Saltmeisterr> how long is this?
[0:27:47] <%RetroCop87> it'd be a nice change
[0:27:50] <%ArchimerCXV> mind giving me a heads up when that happens?
[0:27:51] <orphan_ash> :-) :-)
[0:27:53] <+Wizardism> Sure Pat
[0:28:02] <majindusto> I'm Still Waiting
[0:28:06] <%BoxNavy> were gonna see it chat
[0:28:06] <F_manS> all slickled up?
[0:28:08] <%arancet> @Partialrecall2 hes playing on switch atm, but pc port is totally worth it
[0:28:08] <ArkhamBenji> Is this a Sonic?
[0:28:12] <notquitedead123> Is this Mario Kart?
[0:28:13] <%BoxNavy> its gonna be great
[0:28:13] <Daxalog> Verse 4
[0:28:14] <%TalisKanju> @Partialrecall2 This is the Switch version, PC version is great
[0:28:15] <Saltmeisterr> sure :)
[0:28:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[0:28:24] <%Dementedpenguin> Personally I think this segment goes on too long.
[0:28:26] <%Infernal_Dalek> @ArkhamBenji no it's Shadow the Hedgehog
[0:28:39] <morow1ec> fuck this stage
[0:28:44] <%BoxNavy> mario 3d world
[0:28:48] <Reanimator83> You’ll show us Pat
[0:28:53] <+Partialrecall2> it's not woolie playing vanquish at least
[0:28:53] <notquitedead123> Some of those car just randomly crash...
[0:29:00] <ArkhamBenji> @Infernal_Dalek Of course cause of the gun lol
[0:29:05] <%TalisKanju> Space Harrier?
[0:29:09] <bakkatohri> If you're gonna play the PC version, it has all the button prompts off by default @anybody wanting to play it. You could easily get stuck on the 2nd level if you didn't know you were supposed to do a specific move.
[0:29:11] <Cameony> i wish more games had road rash levels
[0:29:11] <%Monkeyweed21> Space harrier is the name
[0:29:14] <%Infernal_Dalek> @ArkhamBenji and the motorcycle ofc
[0:29:16] <%BoxNavy> is lode runner that game tahts kinda like spelunky
[0:29:21] <BleedinActionMan> It's space harrier
[0:29:24] <Vyskus> what the fuck kind of highway is this, what engineered designed this shit
[0:29:25] <@SoFarFetched> Time to play more Super Hanga on
[0:29:26] <Gameaholic42> Is the one where you ride the rocket? Cause that's EASILY my least favorite level.
[0:29:27] <@SoFarFetched> Hang*
[0:29:28] <%BoxNavy> or am i crazy
[0:29:30] <%RetroCop87> man, Space Harrier music would be great for this
[0:29:31] <$KamenOtaku> Space Harrier is the missile section
[0:29:31] <%Monkeyweed21> its the same music and bullets
[0:29:36] <+Partialrecall2> @bakkatohri ty for heads up
[0:29:36] <BleedinActionMan> The Space Harrier level is actually my favorite
[0:29:38] <justinjones1989> New Half in the bag gotta go.. by gingermen
[0:29:41] <SomersaultJustice> I think this is a remix of afterburner
[0:29:42] <SirDogBear> just think of all the games in arcades in yakuza games CorgiDerp
[0:29:47] <%arancet> its way too long
[0:29:49] <valriot> FUCK INVERTED CONTROLS
[0:29:49] <%Ranryu692> it made me put the game down and not pick it back up
[0:29:49] <%AzureGale> Is this the highway from The Matrix
[0:29:51] <$KamenOtaku> But it has the best intro, "This is MY Fantasy Zone"
[0:29:51] <%Dementedpenguin> I HATE that level.
[0:29:53] <%adzy2k6> So, do regular humans see the demons or angels destroying all this stuff?
[0:29:54] <CloniiCory> Lode Runner is the one where the guy digs the holes to trap enemies I think?
[0:29:56] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt But it has the single best boss in the fgame
[0:29:57] <Blank9> it's not even just that platinum is really, really not good at shmups
[0:29:58] <Gameaholic42> You don't need to. It's pretty obvious
[0:29:58] <%Ynkubus_> It at the very least needed checkpoints
[0:30:01] <%Dementedpenguin> It puts a dent on the finale
[0:30:02] <%TalisKanju> It's based on After Burner but it plays Space Harrier music and has bosses based on that
[0:30:02] <majindusto> HE'S JUST SO GOOD AT THIS Kappa
[0:30:03] <DagetStreams> Ok but consider this: the turret fight
[0:30:07] <DAIHIME> just get good at space harrier you stupid gaijin
[0:30:07] <+BrendenLive> brende1Tea1 brende1Tea2
[0:30:10] <UltimateDomon> God it sucks that the last Jeanne fight is locked behind that level too
[0:30:13] <alvaroeltz> i mean, both this level and that one are too long
[0:30:13] <%BoxNavy> oh my goooood
[0:30:17] <its_the_ether_bunny> i like the mega man tunes
[0:30:18] <+superchronicc> as a man who played this yesterday, it is by far the worst level they put in there, i cant believe it
[0:30:22] <$KamenOtaku> But yeah, all the vehicle sections go on too long, imo
[0:30:24] <%BoxNavy> B)
[0:30:28] <%Dementedpenguin> @UltimateDomon Fuck, don't remind me LUL
[0:30:28] <Reanimator83> I forgot about the rocket ride
[0:30:28] <UltimateDomon> Like imagine every time you wanted to fight Vergil you had to play 10 minutes of Bubble Bobble first
[0:30:35] <%RetroCop87> bullshit
[0:30:37] <%walternatorz> flawless.
[0:30:38] <Blank9> platinum never got good at making space harrier or star fox
[0:30:39] <ChungusQuest> Hey folks, friendly reminder not to watch a stream while you're working with knives in the kitchen
[0:30:41] <%BallerSwagBro9k> OUTRUN THEME SLAPS DO HARD
[0:30:42] <super_robo_mg> first try!
[0:30:47] <huskarl_zap> G in gold means "Get Good"
[0:30:54] <+Partialrecall2> -has infinite witch jumps -chooses to use a motorcycle
[0:31:00] <BleedinActionMan> @BallerSwagBro9k That was the Afterburner theme
[0:31:01] <%WhereIsWill> ayy glad to see twitch is dying horribly now
[0:31:07] <%WhereIsWill> isnt*
[0:31:09] <+superchronicc> its like that one video with prozd about the egg delivery side mission that was mandatory
[0:31:15] <%BoxNavy> :)
[0:31:17] <+BettyMwwaahh> Thanks for the 2020MaskUp @pantypan
[0:31:19] <%BoxNavy> bab-loved
[0:31:23] <xxshadowxx416> @chungusquest did you cut yourself
[0:31:23] <$KamenOtaku> I'm having Kinship flashbacks
[0:31:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat sized beloved
[0:31:34] <cherubs_anonymous> But they're smaller, hence faster
[0:31:37] <alvaroeltz> nice starting parry
[0:31:38] <Sunstalker> What's even the point of sending these chumps, like they'll ever beat bayo?
[0:31:44] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[0:31:47] <bakkatohri> Like there are a lot of humanoid angel designs, do they ever do the really canonically scary lookin ones?
[0:32:01] <ChungusQuest> @xxshadowxx416 just a little poke under the fingernail, super creepy but no real damage
[0:32:05] <+Partialrecall2> be not afraid
[0:32:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK YES
[0:32:08] <%the22cstomp> some have shown up
[0:32:10] <CloniiCory> I always appreciated when they show the new enemy type with the book. Makes me think of House of the Dead 2.
[0:32:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Be not Afraid my ass
[0:32:21] <%baka_sugoi> child
[0:32:25] <Profmcstevie> The humanoids are the common enemies, the nightmares are the bosses :)
[0:32:27] <Daxalog> the be not afraids seem reserved for the bosses.
[0:32:30] <%Monkeyweed21> BABY BRONZE
[0:32:30] <bakkatohri> Neat :V
[0:32:31] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt The Space Harrier level is shit, but it also has the single best boss fight in the game
[0:32:33] <%rekinom> B̵͗͠E̷̎̈ ̶͌̕N̶̎͂O̷͋̔T̶͐̕ ̶͛̊A̷̅͝F̸̊͐R̸̿̾Ȧ̷̈́Ḯ̴͘D̶̍͒
[0:32:34] <$KamenOtaku> Kinships! They're golden boats (a pun) and super annoying
[0:32:38] <huskarl_zap> silver gold gold gold gold gold = Bronze
[0:32:38] <%BoxNavy> you must care
[0:32:48] <grimporio> the next cardinal virtue is a weird one
[0:32:55] <%RetroCop87> Space Harrier music is ace though
[0:32:57] <Blank9> but it really, really is not good on it's own merits too
[0:32:58] <super_robo_mg> BYAO?
[0:32:58] <%Dementedpenguin> Cool thing locked behind bad thing.
[0:33:00] <%TalisKanju> The Janne boss fight?
[0:33:08] <%ArchimerCXV> BAOY?
[0:33:09] <NitronStreams> Abyo
[0:33:09] <%Ranryu692> I wasn't looking
[0:33:11] <arkv01> no please expand
[0:33:12] <%adzy2k6> @CloniiCory And then you get to the final boss, and under weakness it just goes "???" :P
[0:33:12] <%Monkeyweed21> YABO
[0:33:13] <+Partialrecall2> bayonaise
[0:33:14] <%cvp5127> OBAY
[0:33:14] <LVL1_Scumbag> boya
[0:33:15] <%walternatorz> BOYA
[0:33:15] <%Ynkubus_> no :)
[0:33:16] <Vyskus> What'd they spell I missed it
[0:33:16] <huskarl_zap> first byao type game
[0:33:16] <+SilverDevilfish> Oyab
[0:33:18] <hamborgini> Yabo?
[0:33:18] <%BoxNavy> holy oh my god
[0:33:19] <UltimateDomon> A Boy
[0:33:19] <segychan> abyo, def
[0:33:19] <+superchronicc> you mean yabo right?
[0:33:22] <+I_Rafiki_x> What could it mean?
[0:33:23] <%Jaxnos> is cuz he lost points for dying, huskarl
[0:33:26] <%TalisKanju> Mayonetta?
[0:33:28] <%Monkeyweed21> it spells YABO
[0:33:33] <%Jaxnos> or using items
[0:33:41] <huskarl_zap> @Jaxnos k
[0:33:48] <bakkatohri> So many save slots ready to be defiled < w <
[0:33:55] <%BoxNavy> NotLikeThis
[0:33:58] <+Partialrecall2> oh good you like collectables right?
[0:34:06] <NitronStreams> JEEZUS
[0:34:11] <super_robo_mg> how did we go from highway motorcycle chase to this?
[0:34:13] <+TheCallousKing> YBAO
[0:34:13] <Daxalog> She said the J word
[0:34:15] <Blank9> maximillian pegasus
[0:34:17] <SirDogBear> smash bros
[0:34:22] <%Monkeyweed21> YABO
[0:34:23] <PrinceOfEden> FOR I AM A MASTER OF DECEPTI-
[0:34:23] <BlkFlameKami> when will bayo fight jesus?
[0:34:26] <Saltmeisterr> baldman
[0:34:30] <+Totally_Not_Toby> "my motivations are complex"
[0:34:30] <NitronStreams> So was Jesus a Lumen sage in this canon?
[0:34:32] <%RetroCop87> FROM SMASH BROS
[0:34:36] <CloniiCory> Lysanderoth is the one with Machinations tho.
[0:34:39] <mattymcfilth> the lamentations of their women
[0:34:40] <bakkatohri> This level is giving me DmC vibes
[0:34:41] <+I_Rafiki_x> Now that's money
[0:34:44] <Daxalog> Save that money!
[0:34:50] <SCIENCE_25> Wait a minute that card
[0:34:55] <%BoxNavy> does platinum still have no money?
[0:34:55] <+superchronicc> its like the ending of dark souls 3
[0:35:02] <%ArchimerCXV> good ol' Platinum Poverty
[0:35:05] <+Partialrecall2> map still makes more sense than ds2
[0:35:07] <%Ranryu692> there was a crow right there
[0:35:07] <%TalisKanju> They do that a BUNCH in this game
[0:35:09] <+I_Rafiki_x> That bird was red
[0:35:11] <%ArchimerCXV> all the money got spent on style
[0:35:11] <Daxalog> Did Nier not make any money?
[0:35:14] <alvaroeltz> "What a bunch of cheap fucks" - Bayo
[0:35:18] <SCIENCE_25> The crow Pat
[0:35:18] <%RetroCop87> This level has some Kingdom Hearts vibes
[0:35:18] <Vyskus> but da bird tho
[0:35:20] <almightygowther> Hello Pat. My Fat Puppy Dog could beat your Fat Puppy Dog in a Fat Puppy Dog Contest.
[0:35:25] <$KamenOtaku> Platinum definitely took Capcom's ethos of recycling when they left to form
[0:35:42] <%Ranryu692> the demo level
[0:35:50] <+superchronicc> there are 2 breakable doors in this section
[0:35:51] <%Ranryu692> that kind of looks like a level from DMC4
[0:35:54] <Iwashi94> they probably were lol
[0:36:03] <huskarl_zap> next boss is ARGUS CORE and ARGUS CORE
[0:36:05] <+Over_ninek> feels like? i feel like they certainly were broke
[0:36:06] <almightygowther> good chance they were
[0:36:06] <%Ranryu692> or area anyway
[0:36:07] <Profmcstevie> I thought they were perpetually broke, you know the whole Platinum games don't sell great
[0:36:07] <Cameony> there's no actual nudity in bayo1, right? Cuz that tag is confusing me on steam
[0:36:09] <Meltgar> @PatStaresAt Where's Bayonetta Gief costume? Kappa
[0:36:11] <%Das_Bass> no money
[0:36:12] <LVL1_Scumbag> Aren't they ALWAYS broke?
[0:36:14] <+Partialrecall2> even the big platinum games kinda got that big empty japanese bandai vibe
[0:36:18] <Gameaholic42> Wasn't Platinum broke for most shit they made?
[0:36:22] <%BoxNavy> antimoney
[0:36:24] <Daxalog> Out of body?
[0:36:28] <$KamenOtaku> Oh yeah
[0:36:28] <+Over_ninek> broke until that kickstarter atleast
[0:36:28] <mattymcfilth> THE MUSIC IS SOOO GUUUUD
[0:36:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Platinum games are so good tho. How do they not have money?
[0:36:45] <Daxalog> Oh I see
[0:36:46] <%TalisKanju> Mysterious Destiny or Tomorrow is Mine?
[0:36:49] <%BoxNavy> psaWhat
[0:36:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Astral Chain got like 1 or 2 moneys
[0:36:58] <+superchronicc> this one sucks
[0:36:59] <Profmcstevie> Platinums biggest seller is Automata at 5 million last I checked
[0:36:59] <+Over_ninek> they havent self published any games so publishers take a cut of the money all of their games
[0:37:00] <BlkFlameKami> pat can't escape
[0:37:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> good jorb
[0:37:02] <BleedinActionMan> @BallerSwagBro9k Because no one buys them
[0:37:02] <Meltgar> EZ MODE IS NOW SELECTABLE Kappa
[0:37:03] <NitronStreams> Do you like ESCORT MISSIONS?
[0:37:06] <chaos2frozen> @BallerSwagBro9k because nobody buys them
[0:37:12] <$KamenOtaku> God, I could never do like 80% of the alfheims way back when this came out
[0:37:14] <+superchronicc> pat cant escape from crossing fate
[0:37:18] <CloniiCory> I mean every developer needs to save money somehow.
[0:37:22] <epyonics> failure is one way to escape
[0:37:27] <mike2hands> that new tim rogers video is so good
[0:37:38] <%Broand> how do you use the claw weapons properly anyway
[0:37:38] <%adzy2k6> That one angel hit your body 3 times :S
[0:37:45] <PrinceOfEden> Just don't get hit
[0:37:47] <PrinceOfEden> It's so simple
[0:37:48] <+superchronicc> you can move the body mid fight
[0:37:48] <PrinceOfEden> KappaHD
[0:37:49] <Daxalog> Any good ranged options?
[0:37:54] <%Dementedpenguin> @BallerSwagBro9k I knew people that legitimately passed on Bayonetta's original release because they thought the game looked silly.
[0:37:58] <%adzy2k6> Splash damage probably
[0:37:59] <%Das_Bass> git gud
[0:38:00] <whitebatsy> Get Good?
[0:38:08] <Vyskus> Murder harder 4Head
[0:38:15] <Gameaholic42> I remember there's some good cheese with the sword, but can't remember what.
[0:38:27] <huskarl_zap> out of body orgasm I mean climax

[1:05:29] <%WhereIsWill> if eva 4 comes to prime will ya do a watch party? @PatStaresAt
[1:05:31] <+superchronicc> wasnt that a frank sinatra song originally?
[1:05:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> Bayonetta DID get a Remaster this year, but this is the Switch version.
[1:05:48] <turretgunz> what system is he doing this on?
[1:05:58] <audrus> its impressive you do this from memory
[1:05:58] <LifeOntheCouch> I wanna play Angel Slayer
[1:06:02] <turretgunz> um no
[1:06:06] <%whyskeywolfe> Way better than Bayonetta 2.
[1:06:08] <LifeOntheCouch> yeah the levels aren't the best...
[1:06:09] <%BallerSwagBro9k> yup
[1:06:11] <cherubs_anonymous> Hard disagree
[1:06:14] <Jane_Lo> and they didn't even fixed the issue with level in bayo2 either
[1:06:21] <%LaughingCatt> they can be very obnoxious
[1:06:31] <Stormo> "this is a great game but the levels are pretty bad" sums up the entire character action genre really
[1:06:32] <%LaughingCatt> also all this damn bloom
[1:06:32] <%Agami23> is baynetta 2 any better?
[1:06:33] <bakkatohri> I don't like gold aesthetics in general.
[1:06:35] <cherubs_anonymous> It feels way more complete than most other character action games
[1:06:35] <+loukemia83> the first few levels are good then platinum ran out of money
[1:06:35] <%CalderGaming> "hard to parse" is what I remember
[1:06:41] <%rumtumtugnutz> @turretgunz Switch
[1:06:42] <+superchronicc> when did bayo on switch come out?
[1:06:47] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh you aesthetically, not level design.
[1:06:48] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 is way better about the secret levels
[1:06:53] <turretgunz> oh god here we
[1:06:59] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I kinda hate the muted colors in this game. I wish the game was way more colourful
[1:07:02] <rufus2k2> @PatStaresAt considering the content of teaser we saw ages ago, do you think we'll get a switcheroo and follow a "Nero" type character ?
[1:07:11] <+Pyroclase> A lot of games try to do the "previous levels spread across a weird dreamscape" thing and I honestly don't really like it
[1:07:15] <%Monkeyweed21> I would take the Qliphoth any day over this
[1:07:16] <@commanderclaw> Hopefully Babylon's Fall is good
[1:07:21] <%whyskeywolfe> Bayonetta 2 reused so many assets from the first game.
[1:07:22] <%LaughingCatt> Neronetta?
[1:07:23] <+Partialrecall2> it's just self-referential... yknow like jojo or arrested development
[1:07:25] <bakkatohri> Like did this game come out when having washed out colors was the fad?
[1:07:26] <%baka_sugoi> platinum was probably underfunded bac then
[1:07:26] <+superchronicc> the lighting in bayo 2 i feel is better
[1:07:27] <rufus2k2> Cuz she gets FUCKED UP in that trailer
[1:07:27] <Stipli> the concept of the spinning level is pretty solid though
[1:07:33] <UltimateDomon> Bayonero
[1:07:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Restart the stage, failure.
[1:07:42] <artoflec> bayonetta reused almost the entirety of bayonetta 1, and its the best part of the game
[1:07:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> @LaughingCatt Bayonero
[1:07:47] <rufus2k2> not even the stalemate of Bayo 2's trailer she just straight up loses
[1:07:50] <%wydamn> Heh heh heh, bang!
[1:07:51] <glass_marcus> BayoNotta
[1:07:53] <@commanderclaw> It was the 360 generation it was a rough time
[1:07:56] <%BoxNavy> theres a bit of piss filter in this too
[1:07:57] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Me neither
[1:07:59] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc i think 2018, bayo1 came with bayo2 as download bonus code
[1:08:02] <%Monkeyweed21> its a money thing
[1:08:02] <@commanderclaw> Remember all the brown and bloom?
[1:08:04] <%baka_sugoi> time to fight god?
[1:08:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember when Diablo 3 was previewed and EVERYONE was mad that it didn't have washed out colors?
[1:08:07] <NitronStreams> I too remember the era of Brown and Bloom
[1:08:10] <%LaughingCatt> PS3 / 360 era was the generation of bloom overuse & "Real is Brown"
[1:08:11] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Give me bright colors any day
[1:08:11] <BleedinActionMan> HERE'S where the bois show up
[1:08:14] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo gotcha
[1:08:14] <marvel877> Well, it WAS designed for the 360...
[1:08:17] <LifeOntheCouch> I'm just playing the levels to unlock Angel Slayer
[1:08:28] <$KamenOtaku> GAUSSIAN BLUR
[1:08:28] <psidefx> The new hot track for him
[1:08:29] <%Agami23> i should really grab bayo2
[1:08:34] <BleedinActionMan> Apocalypse Now reference!
[1:08:38] <%BoxNavy> probably not
[1:08:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Flight of the Valkyries, yeye
[1:08:40] <cherubs_anonymous> They did not
[1:08:43] <SunsetJack> Yes
[1:08:47] <%Monkeyweed21> FUCK NO THEY DIDNT
[1:08:48] <%BoxNavy> are you gonna make some big halos on stream?
[1:08:49] <rufus2k2> isn't there a 1+2 collection for switch, or was that WiiU?
[1:08:49] <Jane_Lo> you mean with rocket launcher? they didn't
[1:08:50] <%SomeSageAdvice> they didnt
[1:08:55] <SunsetJack> With the RPG weapon no?
[1:08:56] <%LaughingCatt> ye ye ye ye ye
[1:08:59] <%ssjklyco> Imagine if this got a DmC Devil May Cry treatment and how awful their version of Bayo would be
[1:09:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dual wield rocket launchers, because fuck you
[1:09:02] <%LaughingCatt> "Gun"
[1:09:03] <Stormo> ROCKET TONFAS
[1:09:03] <rufus2k2> RPGuccis
[1:09:03] <Gameaholic42> If you're talking about what I think, It's still there on PS4
[1:09:05] <LifeOntheCouch> I've never used this weapon much
[1:09:07] <Mvrdok_> I missed that one NotLikeThis
[1:09:07] <dukenux> ahh Kilgore
[1:09:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> KALI ANN
[1:09:09] <+superchronicc> there was a video that i watched recently critiquing the lighting in dmc 5 and how it was over saturated in purple for the most part of that game
[1:09:10] <%Ynkubus_> Rocket tonfas?
[1:09:12] <SunsetJack> It was fixed in 360 noo?
[1:09:14] <Daxalog> So. Is he stealing these?
[1:09:16] <$KamenOtaku> @rufus2k2 2 on the switch came with a code for 1 for a bit
[1:09:16] <CloniiCory> Muddy-Chic was just the style of gaming in the late aughts early 10s.
[1:09:18] <Jane_Lo> @rufus2k2 yeah, it is a collection, but physical cope of bayo1 only in special edition
[1:09:20] <rufus2k2> @ssjklyco they already made HeavenlySword
[1:09:21] <Stipli> the rocket tonfas look great lol
[1:09:22] <+popcorntacomon> whats the glitch?
[1:09:25] <PrimeFiveByFive> I honestly prefer Bayo 1 to 2.
[1:09:25] <%Ynkubus_> Sick

[1:09:41] <BleedinActionMan> @Daxalog He's killing a demon and turning them into a weapon
[1:09:42] <rufus2k2> shock and awe baby~
[1:09:46] <0rond> wasn't it fixed in the switch version?
[1:09:50] <Vyskus> @Daxalog He's beating the crap out of some demons and forging them into weapons
[1:09:51] <%BoxNavy> @Daxalog i think hes killing the demons and using them to make the weapons a la devil may cry
[1:09:52] <Daxalog> In that time?
[1:09:55] <%BoxNavy> dunno though
[1:09:59] <Jane_Lo> @PrimeFiveByFive you aren't alone, i honestly feels same
[1:10:07] <SunsetJack> I am sure it was patched in the old version so it should be patched here...
[1:10:10] <%BoxNavy> hey rodin is strong as fuck
[1:10:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> God I love her glasses so much.
[1:10:14] <Daxalog> Hes barely surviving each one despite being the devil though.
[1:10:18] <rufus2k2> Rodin/Dante: beating demons into submission/weapons
[1:10:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also why do the witches hang out in Paradiso?
[1:10:19] <+superchronicc> would bayonetta just destroy enemies in a dmc game?
[1:10:24] <neekocheeko> bayo 1 > 2 gang rise up
[1:10:29] <0rond> he isn't at full power right now
[1:10:31] <0rond> far from it
[1:10:36] <Daxalog> Oh
[1:10:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Paradiso seems like the last place witches would hang out.

[1:10:48] <%BoxNavy> fockin stone innit guv
[1:10:51] <rufus2k2> @superchronicc if Dante and Co are pure power, Bayo is more agile/tricky
[1:11:01] <cherubs_anonymous> @CommanderSqueaks She's not there by choice
[1:11:03] <0rond> when you fight him you pay him like 10 million bucks that he uses to power himself up

[1:11:52] <Broken_Sonex> So you just want FemRamsy? @PatStaresAt
[1:11:58] <+Delenay> seeing her try to grab that off her shoe was stupid. shes so tall she cant even touch her own feet

[1:12:52] <0rond> it has to be on feet, you might need on hands too to have the combo itself as an option
[1:12:55] <Jane_Lo> @PrimeFiveByFive my issue is mostly with balance, bayo2 mechanics are just not my thing, like i can deal with desth QTEs, but combat balance is just worse
[1:13:03] <%SirGO0SE> audio jungle
[1:13:13] <PrimeFiveByFive> Sorry? She seemed to be having the time of her life LUL
[1:13:13] <Daxalog> did you do a glitch?
[1:13:18] <%wydamn> chav Bayonetta is constantly bumming smokes off her friends, and trying to get them to buy her homeopathy kits.
[1:13:20] <+Delenay> so she will look at dantes double rocket launchers and laugh
[1:13:29] <+epoladia> Was that the glitch?
[1:13:34] <+Pyroclase> are those cannon tonfas?
[1:13:39] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @PatStaresAt Which Moon-based song do you think they'll have for Bayo 3's main theme, like "Fly Me To The Moon" or "Moon River"? I'm thinking "Moonburn" myself
[1:13:41] <+Partialrecall2> like warframe, tonfas broken

[1:14:30] <0rond> those rockets do A LOT of damage too
[1:14:30] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuckin' missiles firing everywhere LUL
[1:14:31] <PrimeFiveByFive> @jane_lo Yeah, The Opening Cutscene was the bomb though.
[1:14:31] <Jane_Lo> yeah, it wasn't fixed and it oblitirates everything
[1:14:39] <+epoladia> That’s so broken omg
[1:14:40] <%Livelinne> shiaLove
[1:14:40] <marvel877> That's a glitch?
[1:14:41] <+Delenay> that doesnt feel like a glitch, that feels like a creative use of game mechanics
[1:14:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @dukenux That's a pretty good pick
[1:14:45] <+IrishWeegee> what is that like a dozen on the flurry?
[1:14:45] <rufus2k2> IT'S THE CIRCUS BABY
[1:14:46] <%Lunaticbro > that is for real
[1:14:50] <LifeOntheCouch> this combat system is nuts
[1:14:55] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I dunno bout that one
[1:14:56] <0rond> nah it's a glitch for sure it shreds everything
[1:14:56] <+Delenay> "creative use"
[1:14:56] <+CookieCutter007> was it removed in bayo 2
[1:14:59] <marvel877> That feels intentional.
[1:15:05] <Daxalog> That. Knee. Strength.
[1:15:10] <Jane_Lo> @PrimeFiveByFive yeah, agree, it's def my fav in entitery of bayo2
[1:15:14] <+Plus_On_Black> aight, you're cool Pat.
[1:15:21] <%bevyrage> ooooh
[1:15:22] <+Delenay> its a fun way of saying abuse the fucking buug
[1:15:24] <+superchronicc> who is the true walking arsenal? dante or bayo?
[1:15:25] <+Totally_Not_Toby> its GOOD
[1:15:27] <Stipli> an intentional bug?
[1:15:29] <%hoodedlefty> It’s not a bug, it’s a feature rubrHeh psaLiz
[1:15:29] <%Broand> does it work for other moves like breakdance?
[1:15:32] <Jane_Lo> @CookieCutter007 yeah, cause that weapon isn't present in bayo2
[1:15:33] <+popcorntacomon> oh shit thats good
[1:15:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I love these Pardiso levels, they're so fun
[1:15:36] <NitronStreams> "Broken as intended"
[1:15:41] <rufus2k2> the distorted real impact of Bayonetta?
[1:15:45] <%Emperor_Machinus> not a bug a feature
[1:15:46] <%SirGO0SE> thats sick, I never saw that
[1:15:46] <%Monkeyweed21> you need that shit to beat the secret boss
[1:15:52] <0rond> it's not intentional. it's a glitch resulting from the game being coded well
[1:15:52] <CloniiCory> Any bug that lets you do cool ass shit is a bug worth keeping tbh
[1:15:58] <Sunstalker> That's a bug like the Shield ripostes on Magic Cannon in Dragons Dogma creating a fucking bullet hell level LUL
[1:16:03] <Vyskus> Bayo is a literal walking arsenal since she wears weapons on her feet
[1:16:05] <bakkatohri> GOTTA GO FAST
[1:16:09] <+superchronicc> the bluepoint mentality
[1:16:16] <%Agami23> remember folks, heaven is an asset flip
[1:16:18] <+IrishWeegee> @superchronicc it would be dante but he keeps selling his shit for pizza money
[1:16:21] <%baka_sugoi> rocket boots
[1:16:35] <%SirGO0SE> best rockets since dmc 2 :)
[1:16:37] <+superchronicc> @IrishWeegee or just shoving it in a closet forever
[1:16:42] <psidefx> Gotta set up the pole show in the town square you see
[1:16:47] <%Monkeyweed21> I always went double durga and then shuraba and kilgore on the other set
[1:16:58] <rufus2k2> bazooka butt waddle
[1:17:03] <0rond> basically the game doesn't have the weapon attributes as uniquely coded, because it's programmed smartly, so when you switch mid way it triggers "weapon attribute" on the weapon you have eeuipped
[1:17:22] <+superchronicc> the very definition of killer heels
[1:17:23] <%Puhff> This is all well and good, but how does Bayonetta feel about pizza?????
[1:17:33] <$dellakitty> Her fuckin' dump walk.
[1:17:38] <%Monkeyweed21> double Durga is the shit
[1:17:38] <+jerker101e> Hey Pat should Have you played Yakuza Dead Souls?? Any thoughts
[1:17:38] <0rond> bayonetta eats pizza on pineapple
[1:17:50] <huskarl_zap> only if it has gold pineapple flakes
[1:17:52] <%BoxNavy> fuck
[1:17:57] <%SirGO0SE> the rockets are firing so long after the kick it looks like shes launching em out of her puss
[1:17:59] <BleedinActionMan> I heard someone else say that she eats pizza with a fork and knife
[1:18:13] <huskarl_zap> silver spoon
[1:18:18] <+superchronicc> i hate those things
[1:18:30] <rufus2k2> @Puhff knife and fork only
[1:18:31] <BleedinActionMan> Otherwise it's a headbutt
[1:18:31] <+T3mperance> he got those PogChamp
[1:18:40] <+Partialrecall2> poledance for progress
[1:18:45] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I would kill many things to get that cut effect in DMC V.
[1:18:45] <grimporio> @PatStaresAt if you perfect pary with the nunchucks you get a 1 inch punch
[1:18:46] <Jane_Lo> these enemies are fine, but their golden version however... oof
[1:18:48] <%Puhff> thanks, I hate her :)
[1:18:51] <0rond> @PatStaresAt the link outfit automatically comes with the parry, it also changes the sword to the master sword, give it a shot
[1:18:57] <+epoladia> Perfect parry PogChamp
[1:19:09] <%wydamn> @Puhff she prefers lollipops
[1:19:14] <cherubs_anonymous> @0rond He knows, he just hates the outfit
[1:19:21] <%Monkeyweed21> more like super power pearl
[1:19:27] <0rond> that's a shame
[1:19:46] <@SoFarFetched> when Super Monkey Ball though
[1:19:51] <psidefx> That was good
[1:19:52] <NichStachel> This is wild to see you play videos games again! I’ve always saved myself from bayo spoilers, but I’ll watch you for sure
[1:19:54] <Stipli> how many alfheim is there in total?
[1:20:19] <TioXyco> oh, fly me to the moon?
[1:20:25] <rytisone> shuraba pkp
[1:20:27] <0rond> 21
[1:20:32] <Jane_Lo> @Stipli 20 i think? or something like that
[1:20:34] <grimporio> @PatStaresAt do the PKP with the sword, it has range
[1:20:35] <+superchronicc> this looks annoying
[1:20:37] <WonderSign> PKP is easiest
[1:20:47] <%Monkeyweed21> its like DmC
[1:20:52] <+Partialrecall2> more wicked weaves than a cardi concert
[1:21:04] <Vcom7418> PKP, Pat, PKP
[1:21:06] <Profmcstevie> I spent most of my playthrough PKP after I found it, it's fun to clear a crowd LUL
[1:21:17] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah pkp is the way
[1:21:32] <artoflec> i always just spammed PKP in these, the alfheims are 90% not fun at all
[1:21:35] <+gitgouda> does she she have cannons on her legs?
[1:21:46] <%Ynkubus_> yup
[1:21:50] <0rond> @gitgouda no
[1:21:54] <0rond> they are rocket launchers
[1:21:57] <rufus2k2> @gitgouda RPGuccis

[1:22:28] <+gitgouda> so punny i feel bad for laughing
[1:22:44] <artoflec> i like the astral chain just had dodge offset built in
[1:22:46] <LifeOntheCouch> PKP is much faster, trust me
[1:22:50] <mike2hands> U GOT THIS
[1:22:50] <%WhereIsWill> it looks annoying af LUL
[1:22:53] <grimporio> PKP with shuraba
[1:23:00] <Noogiez> do the thing where you win pat
[1:23:06] <%AyotoCorp> PKP Shuraba with offset clears these easy
[1:23:06] <+Partialrecall2> bad time in alfhiem call me kirito
[1:23:09] <+epoladia> PKP for the win

[1:23:54] <LifeOntheCouch> I did this alphiem yesterday, took so long to figure it out
[1:24:01] <TioXyco> this version of fly me to the moon sounds like it came out of evangelion
[1:24:04] <TioXyco> I love it
[1:24:14] <Clundy> Harvey Orbman, Attorney at Law

[1:24:41] <LifeOntheCouch> I love her voice lines
[1:24:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Don't forget you can also do a raw Weave with back-forward punch/kick if you have magic meter
[1:25:25] <LifeOntheCouch> PKP doesn't require magic though @a_cd_by_thomas
[1:25:33] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @LifeOntheCouch Bayo's voice actor clearly had a lot of fun, shame we don't see her in a lot outside it
[1:25:57] <audrus> a champion of pogs

[1:26:01] <%baka_sugoi> FOOTSIES
[1:26:02] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @LifeOntheCouch It doesn't? I thought the added Weave requires Magic Gauge, otherwise it's just a plain PKP
[1:26:04] <%SirGO0SE> psaDab
[1:26:06] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:26:10] <%WhereIsWill> them counters tho

[1:30:41] <Profmcstevie> French AND sleepy? he's basically a corpse playing bayo
[1:30:43] <Vyskus> If I had some braincells to spare I'd let you borrow them but alas
[1:30:44] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc yeah, but there's like two of them, "very easy" included, that's what i'm reffering too so it feels more like hard mode, despite it being called "normal"
[1:30:46] <rufus2k2> suddenly, Yoko Taro
[1:30:47] <shotgang86> Oh yeah the combo that you need to watch yourself to not abuse when playing because its so busted
[1:30:47] <+superchronicc> a baby peen

[1:31:08] <artoflec> draw a circle around that arena with your wonderful 100
[1:31:15] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc and especially, since bayo2 "3rd climax/hard" is actually pretty normal too

[1:31:46] <BleedinActionMan> Why did they change the difficulty names in the switch port of Bayo 2?
[1:31:51] <Laecerelius> Damn you boats!
[1:31:51] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> gotta save dem braincells for da bois in 2 mins
[1:31:51] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah Worship is awesome
[1:31:54] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo but which difficulty was the intended way to play?
[1:31:56] <%FacetiousAF> come to da back of da boat
[1:31:57] <+epoladia> Rip Woolie at this section
[1:32:00] <%BoxNavy> :)
[1:32:00] <Hydrapissed> LoL
[1:32:05] <0rond> @rufus2k2 the way it works is you start an attack with the weak and fast weapon and than switch to the slow and strong weapon so it uses the fast move, pat used the slow weapon and did the slow attack with the weak and fast weapon.
[1:32:06] <LVL1_Scumbag> You were saying
[1:32:18] <psidefx> Come to the back of the boat
[1:32:19] <LifeOntheCouch> remember guys, this is normal mode lol
[1:32:24] <shotgang86> ...Pat is going to abuse the fuck out this combo isn't he?
[1:32:25] <rufus2k2> @0rond ahhhh, ok!
[1:32:30] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc that's a good question, since normal doesn't really unlocks you stuff in bayo2, unlike in bayo1 which it does
[1:32:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I wonder if you can reflect Worship's missiles back with Weaves, like with Fortitudo
[1:32:33] <ChungusQuest> Man, I walk away for 10 minutes and all of a sudden we're Gurren Lagann?
[1:32:36] <Daxalog> Problem solver combo.

[1:33:47] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo Ive always thought normal was what was intended for the actual experience of a character action, which is probably why they had easy and very easy have auto combos
[1:33:52] <%baka_sugoi> we're pat's tow jams

[1:37:51] <Vyskus> Pat, you've said some shit in the past and I've forgiven you. BUT THAT IS TOO FAR
[1:37:52] <zehjojo> No no, he's got a point
[1:37:52] <BerryliciousDefinition> its lemon
[1:37:52] <CloniiCory> Breaking news: Pat is actually super right.
[1:37:52] <+Delenay> green apples the best flavor . give me back my smirnoff green apple cooler damn it
[1:37:53] <PanicSwytch> grape
[1:37:56] <Noogiez> bayo only eats coffin flavored
[1:37:56] <DickieWoodsmall_279> Pat suddenly revealing he may have good taste after all
[1:37:56] <PrinceOfEden> Green Apple? What a weird fucking way to pronounce WATERMELON.
[1:37:57] <0rond> O R A N G E
[1:37:58] <%Aztec50> the stick to candy ratio of these suckers is absurd
[1:37:59] <SCIENCE_25> Cherry all the way.

[1:38:26] <+CookieCutter007> pineapple
[1:38:27] <DickieWoodsmall_279> GREEN sugar is way better than PURPLE sugar

[1:38:39] <NitronStreams> Well, in my opinion the Jedi are evil
[1:38:40] <%twistedj3ster> I used to hate grape, now I love it
[1:38:41] <Noogiez> grape jam tho

[1:38:49] <psidefx> STRAWBERRY woolieGASM woolieGASM
[1:38:50] <SCIENCE_25> It's okay Pat. We all know you need the sourness to feel anything.
[1:38:50] <%Monkeyweed21> watermelon and green apple are the best
[1:38:50] <Vyskus> Green Apple sucks Ass and anytime I eat something green and expect lime but get that I die inside
[1:38:51] <+GuyNooN> SODA FLAVORS KICK ALL THE ASS
[1:38:53] <LVL1_Scumbag> Pat gonna get a visit from the Grapist.
[1:38:54] <wannabemoogle> Cotton candy flavor is the worst
[1:38:54] <Udongein_1> suffer once again
[1:38:55] <PrimeFiveByFive> Cola though.
[1:38:57] <%BoxNavy> jermaVenus
[1:38:57] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc yeah i agree completly, but it just kind of eleminated the more casual crowd, i heard a lot of people complaining not wanting to play "automatic combos", but having done less damatge to you
[1:38:58] <huskarl_zap> whats the best flavor of wool aid?
[1:38:59] <%SirGO0SE> jermaSun war in chat
[1:39:02] <saiyanblitz> I have no opinions about Lollipops so blazin5Tea
[1:39:06] <DickieWoodsmall_279> the return of git and gud pt.2
[1:39:10] <%crazyspartan214> nothing can beat cherry
[1:39:12] <%wydamn> The correct answer is actually watermelon but green apple is fine too
[1:39:26] <%BoxNavy> green apple cherry and lemon are all great
[1:39:30] <PrimeFiveByFive> I need a Lollipop Chainsaw remaster.
[1:39:34] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt When Kamiya did a Let's Play of this game, he said that the locations of the secret missions made sense to the devs
[1:40:01] <%LaughingCatt> he did a lie?
[1:40:03] <%SirGO0SE> whats the best brand of lollypop and are they better than just having jolly ranchers
[1:40:03] <%Lion_kun> why don't you abuse the torture finishers?
[1:40:03] <%BoxNavy> he did a liar
[1:40:06] <zehjojo> Kamiya did a let's play of this?
[1:40:07] <DickieWoodsmall_279> are you telling me the platinum devs may be insane assholes?
[1:40:09] <Laecerelius> Maybe they just used adventure game moon logic
[1:40:12] <%Lion_kun> It seems like you hold back on them for no reason.
[1:40:13] <Vcom7418> Hideki Kamiya: "Fuck you, blocked"
[1:40:13] <%blistexthief> What an untruth he did
[1:40:14] <%baka_sugoi> why he lie
[1:40:15] <huskarl_zap> not a yakuza lie?
[1:40:18] <Profmcstevie> Sounds like big lies, or the devs have no idea how to view something they themselves create
[1:40:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Game Developer Lies, Blocks Everyone On Twitter
[1:40:20] <rufus2k2> remember when he was supposed to unblock everyone he ever blocked on twitter? I'm still blocked :(
[1:40:20] <%LaughingCatt> sofieGasp
[1:40:20] <shotgang86> man in Bayo 1 is such bullshit
[1:40:29] <Daxalog> I like when devs do lets plays of their own games. Especially when its non heads
[1:40:33] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> It probs looked like it made sense in the code and then QA was like lol
[1:40:33] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Green Apple Strawberry Watermelon the kings of Lollipop
[1:40:34] <artoflec> remember when kamiya's dad just left him at a beach after making him run there barefoot because he didnt do this homework
[1:40:36] <PrinceOfEden> Welp, if Pat wasn't blocked before, he is now.
[1:40:36] <%BoxNavy> @SirGO0SE jolly ranchers are just lollipops without the stick
[1:40:37] <voodoolawyer> WHY THIS MUSIC SO GOOD
[1:40:38] <%SirGO0SE> speen :)
[1:40:38] <BleedinActionMan> Tootsie Pops are the best Lollipops
[1:40:39] <Enyoyable> Hideki "Tod Howard" Kamiya
[1:40:39] <shotgang86> spiiiiiiiiiiiiin
[1:40:45] <dinnydanny777> Oh heck Twitch didn't notify me about this NotLikeThis
[1:40:47] <Jane_Lo> @shotgang86 i know right? that's why it's so awesome
[1:40:51] <zehjojo> SPEEEEEEEEN
[1:40:59] <%baka_sugoi> Stripper pole OP
[1:41:03] <%BoxNavy> a shitzillions
[1:41:07] <voodoolawyer> dude ... the music
[1:41:15] <voodoolawyer> maybe I shoulda played this game
[1:41:17] <Profmcstevie> Damage, range, stun, spin stick. best in show angel arm
[1:41:23] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo I guess it just comes down to what the devs think the playerbase will be like, the thing i hated about dmc 5 was harder difficulties were locked and had to do multiple playthroughs to unlock them, but thats just me
[1:41:27] <%SirGO0SE> @SirGO0SE yeah and when I think of a lolipop flavor the JR version comes to mind first
[1:41:33] <A_CD_By_Thomas> munch
[1:41:40] <BleedinActionMan> @artoflec This explains a lot
[1:41:45] <Jane_Lo> and then it got nerfed :(
[1:41:45] <PrimeFiveByFive> @sirgo0se Chupa Chupes. Anything else tastes like cheap.
[1:41:57] <%Monkeyweed21> if only
[1:42:00] <SCIENCE_25> Kappa
[1:42:02] <%AzureGale> I like quick selects
[1:42:02] <0rond> it would be, shame you are too much of a piss baby coward to get it
[1:42:06] <%Emperor_Machinus> reverse pandora?
[1:42:07] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc fair point
[1:42:07] <A_CD_By_Thomas> speen
[1:42:08] <+Dova573> isint that one of the secret weapons?
[1:42:08] <+doc_savage> That would really be dop[e
[1:42:09] <Vcom7418> I feel like this is sarcasm but I am not sure
[1:42:16] <+GuyNooN> Devil arms.. I wish they could be that flagrant
[1:42:19] <psidefx> The wolf starts to cry if only if only
[1:42:20] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @superchronicc well half the point of SoS and DMD is to put late game enemies in early, which would be dumb on a first playthrough
[1:42:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye
[1:42:23] <%Monkeyweed21> shame pat is too weak to get it
[1:42:23] <+Plus_On_Black> I'm stealing your idea and your money now.
[1:42:27] <%SirGO0SE> @PrimeFiveByFive strawberry & cream Kreygasm
[1:42:28] <PrinceOfEden> If there was, I would make it very expensive.
[1:42:28] <A_CD_By_Thomas> But it's true tho
[1:42:33] <%ssjklyco> He's a Binky Dick Coward
[1:42:33] <shotgang86> I wonder why Bayonetta 1 is so much better than Bayonetta 2
[1:42:34] <%Monkeyweed21> lol no you cant
[1:42:37] <%Lion_kun> sureeeeeeeee
[1:42:37] <+Bail_seven> bafeore you got old?
[1:42:38] <+gnoame> That's MR piss baby coward to you guys
[1:42:39] <dinnydanny777> Pat can like... get it Kappa
[1:42:41] <%Lion_kun> but can you get it now?
[1:42:42] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YOU ARE THO
[1:42:42] <%mister___doctor> Alright Pee Infant Scaredy Cat
[1:42:52] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Piss Angels
[1:42:54] <Oqzar> speaking of pee
[1:42:58] <Broken_Sonex> Yeah, but that was back when you were strong and handsome.
[1:42:58] <0rond> i'll believe it when I see it
[1:43:00] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Bail_seven calm down that fire is too hot
[1:43:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> Should we not call a stone a stone?
[1:43:05] <SCIENCE_25> So you WEREN'T a piss baby coward back in the day.
[1:43:12] <huskarl_zap> golden shower angels
[1:43:15] <PrimeFiveByFive> @sirgo0se Yup, those are great.
[1:43:24] <BleedinActionMan> But you're gonna get ass for combo score
[1:43:27] <+ScatterCatt> Can someone explain this broken bug to me? I just got here.
[1:43:33] <huskarl_zap> PISS WATER KEK
[1:43:36] <danknugglit> SSS
[1:43:38] <Jane_Lo> @shotgang86 probably because bayo2 wasn't tested by players (by the computer i believe?) and that lead to a lot of strange combat decision. game however does have better visual presentation
[1:43:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> GOLDEN SHOWER
[1:43:42] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo me personally, capcom should have had the option at the start for those who wanted to have the challenge, like myself
[1:43:43] <huskarl_zap> jar bayonetta
[1:43:43] <%twistedj3ster> that sound clip won't haunt you ever
[1:43:48] <anovertmoose> @ScatterCatt rockets fire more than they should
[1:43:48] <afronooch> thats someone's kink
[1:43:48] <DickieWoodsmall_279> well pissbaby gamer would be too redundant
[1:43:48] <%blistexthief> This game needed SMG nunchuks
[1:44:00] <PrimeFiveByFive> Nah, it's ginger ale water.
[1:44:07] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo just give everyone the option to cater to their own ecxperience
[1:44:08] <%Monkeyweed21> Watersports
[1:44:12] <0rond> @ScatterCatt weak weapon hit fast strong weapon hit slow, switch to the strong weapon when while using weak weapon attack to attack fast with strong weapon
[1:44:15] <shotgang86> just use the statues jesus
[1:44:16] <Daxalog> is she firing her gun slower than normal?
[1:44:18] <+GuyNooN> this game needs more judgement cut end
[1:44:20] <+ScatterCatt> Oh, for the moves where you hold the button down for the guns @anovertmoose ? Okay, that's cool.
[1:44:22] <Sunstalker> Taunt it?
[1:44:26] <%FacetiousAF> what a great enemy
[1:44:29] <+fetrigon> BEST ENEMY DESIGN IN THE GAME
[1:44:34] <Idon__> every character action game has that fucker who just flies around
[1:44:34] <+Plus_On_Black> @blistexthief is the smartest person in this damn Jam
[1:44:38] <Idon__> Why
[1:44:38] <SCIENCE_25> Use the statues?
[1:44:41] <%BoxNavy> this romm sucks

[1:45:08] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @0rond I remember the DmC LP where pat pointed out that fast attacks would be stronger and destroyed my gamer brain
[1:45:11] <Jane_Lo> @superchronicc yeah, that's fair, i suppose
[1:45:17] <LVL1_Scumbag> Does it take longer than waitng for the enemy to attack?
[1:45:25] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Pissspired

[1:45:39] <%RetroCop87> BAYOSPORTS
[1:45:42] <%BoxNavy> it doesnt smell like piss it smells like the fetish
[1:45:43] <dinnydanny777> Fetishes? In a Bayonetta game?
[1:45:45] <+superchronicc> @Jane_Lo or just do what dark souls does, and have no difficulty whasoever
[1:45:46] <%baka_sugoi> EWW PP
[1:45:50] <0rond> does the bird have the "zip to the enemy" move in this one or is it only in bayo 2?
[1:45:51] <Daxalog> Tags: Watersports, serpent, latex, snuff
[1:45:54] <+GuyNooN> stinks like when pat will inevitably shit himself on stream
[1:45:57] <%SirGO0SE> pipi fetish is probably very stinky
[1:45:58] <huskarl_zap> this is Platinum's jar
[1:45:59] <shotgang86> this whole area stinks of "we have run out of money and we need filler content"

[1:46:08] <%ssjklyco> It's not piss, it's Holy Water
[1:46:08] <dinnydanny777> Why would you say this
[1:46:08] <%baka_sugoi> Unsanitary
[1:46:09] <Idon__> Stop Pat, Kamiya's fetishes do not go that far.
[1:46:10] <PanicSwytch> Its her fetish
[1:46:11] <psidefx> Very stinky
[1:46:11] <valriot> Pissonetta
[1:46:12] <%cowardman93> Kamiya was having a strange day
[1:46:13] <%doc_ock_rokc> golden shower? no GOLDEN BATH
[1:46:14] <danknugglit> Why did they make it yellow
[1:46:18] <%mister___doctor> ...anyway
[1:46:26] <%MechArch> Asparagus yellow smelly piss
[1:46:32] <SCIENCE_25> Bath? More like golden pool
[1:46:32] <%cowardman93> becuase PISS
[1:46:35] <Hydrapissed> golden experince
[1:46:36] <%ssjklyco> Gold means holy
[1:46:36] <danknugglit> LUL no
[1:46:37] <Jane_Lo> because the whole game has yellow-ass filter all over it?
[1:46:37] <zehjojo> They really didnt have to dye the lake gold to give you a sense of this area being angelic or heavenly.
[1:46:37] <huskarl_zap> would have been better if was pure platinum water?
[1:46:37] <%SaiyanShoto> This was during the time when ugly colors were prominent in almost every game
[1:46:39] <%baka_sugoi> "GOLD"
[1:46:43] <SaltyAzteca> Eyyyyy
[1:46:45] <BleedinActionMan> I think Bayo 2 being easier than 1 had something to do with Kamiya not being in charge
[1:46:46] <0rond> it's gold! it's SHOWERING YOU IN GOLD
[1:46:47] <zehjojo> Golden shower Kappa
[1:46:47] <SaltyAzteca> GOOOOLD
[1:46:47] <%YakumoYomi> Piss statue
[1:46:48] <%Monkeyweed21> How does Bayonetta go to the bathroom in her hairsuit? Does it just open a hole in itself? @PatStaresAt
[1:46:48] <+gnoame> pee statue for pee boy
[1:46:53] <%baka_sugoi> PP statue
[1:46:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> Golden statue
[1:46:57] <%Lion_kun> that's not a platinum Pat
[1:46:57] <%BoxNavy> games loved to be ugly
[1:46:57] <Broken_Sonex> Pat why do you want Bayo to drown in piss?
[1:46:58] <%mister___doctor> enjoy your piss statue Pat
[1:46:59] <%SirGO0SE> pp statue
[1:47:02] <huskarl_zap> no
[1:47:03] <%SaiyanShoto> The PS3/360 era had some ugly aesthetics
[1:47:04] <+CookieCutter007> gears of war :)
[1:47:05] <Hydrapissed> gray wash
[1:47:05] <Zezinizzle> always sucked at angel attack
[1:47:06] <Saltmeisterr> yeah it sucks
[1:47:08] <%cowardman93> it was the most bland generation
[1:47:09] <huskarl_zap> the gears era?
[1:47:10] <Profmcstevie> Washed the fuck out
[1:47:12] <Jane_Lo> @BleedinActionMan yeah, cause kamiya was just supervising
[1:47:13] <%BoxNavy> the mission statement was "we have to make the game ugly"
[1:47:15] <Daxalog> xbox 360 muddy and bloom
[1:47:15] <dinnydanny777> That's why Skyward Sword was so good :)
[1:47:17] <Bust_ER> deux ex has a piss filter
[1:47:17] <%Monkeyweed21> its grey and washed out gold
[1:47:17] <Udongein_1> rusty looking
[1:47:20] <shotgang86> between 2006 and 2009 developers refused to use color
[1:47:20] <+superchronicc> i remeber re5 being so saturated and grainy
[1:47:22] <DickieWoodsmall_279> they could've gone in even harder on the fetishes. there's bayo 2 concept art of bayo wearing a diaper and bib
[1:47:23] <+Bail_seven> no
[1:47:23] <ChungusQuest> I remember the issue of VGCats that addressed this issue
[1:47:26] <%BoxNavy> not wrong
[1:47:26] <UltimateDomon> Agree
[1:47:28] <dinnydanny777> Skyward Sword came out and brought colour into the gaming world :)
[1:47:28] <%cowardman93> yeah I'd agree
[1:47:29] <shotgang86> You're absolutely right
[1:47:29] <afronooch> true
[1:47:29] <NitronStreams> Games were ashamed of color because "Color=for kids"
[1:47:29] <+Partialrecall2> it's a nice middle ground of sepia and greyscale
[1:47:31] <+ScatterCatt> @PatStaresAt how could you say something so brave yet so right?
[1:47:31] <theloganbrand> you're right
[1:47:31] <%Agami23> i'll agree
[1:47:32] <%coreyyotto> not even an argument it's true
[1:47:33] <fuji_92> nah
[1:47:33] <PanicSwytch> This game came out along Darksiders and Im glad I chose to play this
[1:47:34] <danknugglit> Fair
[1:47:35] <%Monkeyweed21> yea crash bandicoot sucks
[1:47:36] <Stipli> there was some decent games in there
[1:47:36] <+CookieCutter007> but the shovelware was pretty lit though
[1:47:37] <pilllowofbees> Ghost was colorful as shit
[1:47:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> I won't dissagree but we got some bangers out of it as well
[1:47:37] <DianaTheAscian> yeah
[1:47:38] <%ssjklyco> I blame the people who complained games looked kitty
[1:47:38] <%Alazull> Yeah
[1:47:38] <Zezinizzle> i liked mid 360/PS3 era
[1:47:38] <%twistedj3ster> idk, last gen wasn't great
[1:47:38] <%BoxNavy> had some winners but alot of stinkers
[1:47:40] <artoflec> and it went on SOOOO LONG
[1:47:41] <Hydrapissed> Wii u
[1:47:41] <%SirGO0SE> ps5 :)
[1:47:41] <%Movemeister> Can’t disagree
[1:47:42] <huskarl_zap> this one
[1:47:46] <Jane_Lo> @DickieWoodsmall_279 noooo, don't remind about that
[1:47:46] <%coreyyotto> the only way you could think it's good is if it was your first
[1:47:47] <%SaiyanShoto> I agree, it’s when all the worst kinds of tropes came out
[1:47:47] <Profmcstevie> It's THE growing pains generation, with tons of games not finding their style
[1:47:49] <Sunstalker> Fuck you, pat. Souls series were born in that era
[1:47:50] <+GuyNooN> I would argue early xbone and ps4 was way worse @PatStaresAt
[1:47:52] <%tinyswampthing> replaying revengance
[1:47:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Neir
[1:47:52] <%Monkeyweed21> Banjo Kazooie era?
[1:47:56] <+gnoame> Pat was fighting back the urge to say if you disagree you can fuck off so hard
[1:47:59] <YeetBoss> has he acknowleged the new tim rogers video yet?
[1:47:59] <%Movemeister> But there were some good uns too
[1:48:00] <%Mrbaconator> the pong machine era @PatStaresAt
[1:48:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LOST PLANET 2
[1:48:00] <%superc37> halo
[1:48:00] <%SaiyanShoto> There was a lot of bland
[1:48:00] <PrinceOfEden> I mean, I disagree, but I can't really argue that there was a worse era.
[1:48:04] <%mythcreant> mythcreant subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! five months of nonsense ... continues
[1:48:06] <Hydrapissed> WHOLE gen guys
[1:48:06] <CloniiCory> It's hard to argue that tbh. Alot of garbage practices got started in that era that still infest the industry now.
[1:48:07] <%YakumoYomi> Wii/PS3/360 is definitely my pick for worst gen
[1:48:07] <+plzdodge> Xbox One/PS4 era due to how slow start it was and it was riddled with almost illegal bs
[1:48:09] <%coreyyotto> early ps360 was dogshit
[1:48:09] <rufus2k2> lol luka's scream
[1:48:10] <dinnydanny777> But Pat brown = "realistic" LUL
[1:48:10] <super_robo_mg> "crash-era atari"? but crash was on the ps1 4Head
[1:48:10] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt not really in the handheld part though
[1:48:11] <Stipli> Nier was in there
[1:48:11] <%SirGO0SE> for the Xbone, it is the whole gen
[1:48:14] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt "Crash Era Atari"
[1:48:15] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> I'd say n64/ps1 has aged a lot worse
[1:48:15] <Zezinizzle> oh ill take PS3 gen over PS4 any day personally
[1:48:17] <%Bailey__gaming> hi pat feelin pretty shitty
[1:48:19] <+Plus_On_Black> The best year of Video Games was 2014
[1:48:19] <Hydrapissed> put on ur grasses
[1:48:27] <tubit> Dark Souls?
[1:48:28] <+superchronicc> i mean, who could follow up on the killer era of ps2, with the world's biggest library
[1:48:35] <%Alazull> Whole gen, because otherwise late PS3/360 was alright
[1:48:35] <%twistedj3ster> I'd agree it was the worst, but Bioshock 1 came out then
[1:48:35] <%SaiyanShoto> Xbone had KI though, so that’s already great
[1:48:37] <BlkFlameKami> FATHER!!!
[1:48:37] <%cowardman93> so much horrible disgusting shitty practices came into play in the 360 generation, and some of it was so bad it didn't survive
[1:48:37] <shotgang86> its the era that Keiji Inafune had such an Influence on Japanese game developers that we had a whole lost decade of game development on Japan
[1:48:38] <dinnydanny777> Resistance 3 was the worst of it tbh and I liked that game
[1:48:38] <%baka_sugoi> Stand users
[1:48:38] <Idon__> FAAAAAATHER
[1:48:38] <+Partialrecall2> all drama/thriller movies from 2000-2010

[1:48:42] <+Totally_Not_Toby> you pu t your glasses back on and face the truth!
[1:48:42] <%SirGO0SE> Leaving out Sony, do you think the Xbone out performed the 360? Really?

[1:48:43] <PanicSwytch> FF..Father
[1:48:43] <%Movemeister> PogChamp
[1:48:45] <%MrGuy516> I would agree. lackluster games all around and it felt lime the peak of console wars. that shit kinda died down with the PS4/Xbone generation.
[1:48:47] <%mister___doctor> "Fatherrrr."
[1:48:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes

[1:49:07] <super_robo_mg> she can be MY mommy
[1:49:09] <fuji_92> bayo is everyone's mommy
[1:49:10] <%BoxNavy> that "father!" moment is a xavier renegade angel deleted scene
[1:49:11] <NitronStreams> to be fair bayo is everyone's mommy
[1:49:12] <%Movemeister> The answer may surprise you
[1:49:15] <Jane_Lo> yeah LUL
[1:49:16] <dinnydanny777> Oh no is this also a fetish...?
[1:49:19] <psidefx> Now everything makes sense... FOREVER
[1:49:20] <CloniiCory> I'd love for Bayo to be my mommy tbh
[1:49:20] <SCIENCE_25> How are those glasses STAYING ON?!
[1:49:23] <+Partialrecall2> all games should be oversaturated 32 bit colors like PSO2
[1:49:24] <%Monkeyweed21> he spider swings
[1:49:25] <SaltyAzteca> Revelaitons LUL
[1:49:26] <%cowardman93> bayo fulfills a lot of my desires and it worries me
[1:49:26] <+superchronicc> you know she's like 500 years old right luka?
[1:49:28] <+Gragnack> pistol sniping with her god damn legs
[1:49:30] <Vcom7418> "Great men are forged in fire, it's a job of lesser man to light the flame" Gen 7 crawled so gen 8 could walk. I would say though, I was slightly more interested in Triple A gaming during Xbox/PS3 era. After that I was mostly into single A and indies
[1:49:30] <zehjojo> She slew him alright :)
[1:49:31] <artoflec> pretty much every great great game from last gen got remastered or re-released this gen too. There are some exceptions though.
[1:49:33] <TioXyco> @dinnydanny777 everything can be a fetish to someone
[1:49:34] <Profmcstevie> Bayonetta make him shoot web haha

[1:49:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> Is love a fetish?
[1:49:46] <Jane_Lo> @SCIENCE_25 because Kamiya wanted glasses in whole game, deal with it!
[1:49:50] <KnightOfTrousers> (But she's not actually Luka's mother right?)
[1:50:05] <SCIENCE_25> So Kamiya magic. Got it.
[1:50:06] <SaltyAzteca> Pat is so good at the vidya gaem PogChamp

[1:53:04] <%mister___doctor> @saltyazteca 50 on Justista
[1:53:04] <+Plus_On_Black> Elite
[1:53:08] <ChungusQuest> In the classical Latin, it would be pronounced "you-sticky-ah", which is dumb as hell
[1:53:09] <%ScreamLord> Justice is the most Biblically accurate Angle so far
[1:53:13] <+pectusumbra> for some reason this design makes me think of echidna from DMC4
[1:53:16] <%Tearonex> ALL IN ON BAYO
[1:53:21] <+IrishWeegee> what about the other chick that stabbed bayo in theflashback
[1:53:21] <paralars_> i think its amazing how the angel called justice is the one with many faces spewing poison

[1:55:56] <+plzdodge> man looking at this, how did Dante even win the Death Battle?
[1:55:57] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I forgot how close together the Iustita and Sapientia fights are. I think they're only like a level apart if I remember correctly
[1:56:00] <%TimetodiveLTX> ...
[1:56:00] <%Monkeyweed21> would Bayonettas stand cry be ARA ARA ARA ARA?

[1:56:18] <dinnydanny777> This is like that boss in the Pyramid from Sonic Adventure 2 PogChamp
[1:56:19] <%BoxNavy> its that thing you pay for to get rid of ads on twitch
[1:56:22] <+timbob> Look at this guy holding down his buttons, what a scrub

[1:56:28] <shotgang86> oh shit the PIANO PogChamp PogChamp Kappa Kappa
[1:56:29] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @superchronicc he's not, he just wants to look cool and different because he's got a complex
[1:56:34] <Udongein_1> ive never seen that before
[1:56:36] <%baka_sugoi> game cheating
[1:56:36] <BerryliciousDefinition> huh?
[1:56:40] <fuji_92> who uses turbo in this day and age, yall living in 99 or something
[1:56:40] <CloniiCory> @plzdodge Ben is an idiot who gets shit wrong more than he'd care to admit.
[1:56:43] <%twistedj3ster> if anyone didn't need turbo it woud be Pat, he can mash
[1:56:46] <%Emperor_Machinus> it landed on a already broken platform
[1:56:47] <PanicSwytch> He's using the switch pro controller. There's no turbo
[1:56:51] <SirDogBear> Turbo is now selectable
[1:56:51] <%Keyd00d> Pat has always been good at mashing
[1:56:56] <+superchronicc> @DickieWoodsmall_279 oh gotcha, guess i wasnt paying attention to the whole thing
[1:56:57] <%TimetodiveLTX> oh wow
[1:56:59] <fuji_92> theres others ways to cheat, not that I know about those Kappa
[1:57:02] <Broken_Sonex> @plzdodge The simple answer is because Dante was more popular
[1:57:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> Little baby fingers are good for mashing
[1:57:13] <%SirGO0SE> do you guys remember Turbo controllers? LUL
[1:57:16] <BerryliciousDefinition> ORAORAORA
[1:57:16] <%baka_sugoi> ORE ORE ORE ORE
[1:57:19] <+timbob> His mashing is just so efficient that it looks turbo
[1:57:21] <SaltyAzteca> Master Masha
[1:57:29] <Shwepie> Pat upgraded his thumb with a turbo option.
[1:57:29] <%cowardman93> this game let me know my mash game is weak

[1:57:55] <fuji_92> we dont think that at, one guy thinks that
[1:57:56] <PanicSwytch> I can't for the life of me mash the Ocelot interogation in mgs1
[1:57:57] <KargothIronford> pat got them magic mike fingers
[1:57:58] <%BoxNavy> do you think you can outmash ludwig
[1:57:59] <+Totally_Not_Toby> ive been around long enough to see it yeah
[1:58:01] <+fetrigon> not cheating Kappa
[1:58:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> I mean, I would
[1:58:01] <SaltyAzteca> Pat has shown his mashing skills many times before
[1:58:01] <Profmcstevie> Do the baby hands allow you more speed :)
[1:58:02] <DickieWoodsmall_279> pat absorbed paige's ability to mash buttons
[1:58:02] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats a legit good masher, there’s years of proof
[1:58:03] <grimporio> TELOC VOVIM - Dragon of death
[1:58:03] <+Gamblor69> I also use the spasm technique
[1:58:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> pat is the mash king in the old zaibatsu
[1:58:05] <%cowardman93> yes we could hear during the OG RE4 playthrough
[1:58:06] <dinnydanny777> Mashed Patatoes
[1:58:06] <SirDogBear> The Turbo Conspiracy PogChamp
[1:58:08] <+twohitgood> i don't think a switch pro controller even has a turbo mode.
[1:58:10] <ancrest_tant> They don’t know the lore
[1:58:10] <SummonerMagno> Pat is good at repetitive hand motions
[1:58:10] <%vaporousTippler> I think it's more we just don't trust you.
[1:58:11] <BTR_NOODLE> he can mash with the best of them
[1:58:13] <Stipli> LUL mash to your hearts content
[1:58:13] <Broken_Sonex> It's really funny people think you use a tool
[1:58:14] <%walternatorz> don't feed his ego, it mustn't grow any larger
[1:58:14] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> pats thumb is so small he can literally seesaw it ontop of an x button
[1:58:16] <%blistexthief> Pat's mashing skills are the thing of legends
[1:58:17] <%BoxNavy> monkaS
[1:58:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuck yeah
[1:58:19] <%TinyLittleDancer> smaller fingers == less travel time

[1:58:23] <%Keyd00d> The centipede inside your house
[1:58:23] <SaltyAzteca> DO IT PAT
[1:58:24] <shotgang86> F R I E N D L Y
[1:58:24] <tiaramaki> Speaking of that MGS1 interrogation, isn't there a thing where you can mash TOO FAST and the game thinks you're using turbo?
[1:58:25] <%AzureGale> Friendly neighborhood centipede
[1:58:26] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Scorpendra, I believe
[1:58:29] <bakkatohri> Mashing in platinum games just means you get to use the button you meant to. uwu
[1:58:29] <+Over_ninek> damn Pat is good
[1:58:31] <Idon__> smoosh
[1:58:32] <+MrAtheGreat> does the sexy dancing actually help summon the demon or is Bayo just having fun?
[1:58:33] <%Divryne> He's using his feet guys he's gotta be.
[1:58:34] <%SaiyanShoto> The Metal Gear Solid torture mini game helped me be a great masher LUL LUL
[1:58:36] <Saltmeisterr> @PatStaresAt U HEAR THAT POT SFX?
[1:58:37] <Vcom7418> Pat was mashing so fast I couldn't see it lol

[1:58:44] <%Lion_kun> MG1 and PW have the worst mashing sequences of all time
[1:58:44] <%Keyd00d> To shreds you say
[1:58:45] <%mister___doctor> ...is Bayo ctazy?

[1:58:59] <fuji_92> the baby
[1:59:00] <ancrest_tant> Everyone knows it’s a byproduct of his stand with that mashing
[1:59:03] <Stipli> I feel like I would have broken my fingers mashing in a game like this lol
[1:59:04] <+superchronicc> how can she understand this
[1:59:05] <Jane_Lo> @MrAtheGreat they are different to each summon, so "dance" is a part of it

[1:59:56] <%twistedj3ster> also how would she forget english
[2:00:00] <%CalderGaming> is there an explanation for how some of these bosses recur later in the game? is there more than one, or is it just Platinum "don't worry about it"
[2:00:00] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @superchronicc does amnesia make you forget how to talk or shit?
[2:00:03] <%doc_ock_rokc> SUCKS BALLS
[2:00:04] <%wydamn> selective amnesia
[2:00:06] <%Tearonex> video game amnesia
[2:00:06] <%cowardman93> amnesia works however the script needs it to
[2:00:09] <%Emperor_Machinus> it can also be explained here as magic
[2:00:15] <dinnydanny777> Amnesia isn't always that severe though
[2:00:20] <%BoxNavy> jermaPluto
[2:00:23] <$KamenOtaku> Enochian is a thing in the real world, it's a made up angelic language from like the 1500s

[2:00:28] <+whyskeywolfe> Remember: Pat studied to be a psychiatrist.
[2:00:33] <fuji_92> like that one Adam sandler movie
[2:00:34] <+Pyroclase> Remember that lady who got hit in the head during WWII, the brain damage made her sound like she had a german accent, and she got forced out of her village because they thought she was a nazi?
[2:00:35] <%coreyyotto> at least here it's explained that her memories are technically sealed, right? there's nothing wrong with her brain
[2:00:35] <%wydamn> Like Paz!
[2:00:36] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt like Momento

[2:01:55] <%Buzzard42> I knew a guy in high school who got a concussion and lost like 3 months of school
[2:01:57] <Vcom7418> :(
[2:01:59] <%cowardman93> honestly both versions of amnesia sound horrific
[2:02:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Yikes
[2:02:00] <%Alazull> My grandma had it when she had surgery to remove a tumor. It was like ten years of her life never existed
[2:02:02] <+Plus_On_Black> Faq!!
[2:02:03] <Idon__> You're just a different person at that point...
[2:02:04] <tubit> That's pretty terrifying
[2:02:07] <%XeroSigmaPrime> That fucking sucks
[2:02:07] <%SirGO0SE> my roommate in college lost 3 months and went through his life to the day as if it was 3 months earlier it was crazy. he had to restart the semmester
[2:02:09] <+superchronicc> seems very lonely
[2:02:10] <Mirrorcatch> skills are stored differently than experiences according to a famous long-term case study involving a patient with anterograde amnesia
[2:02:13] <+Partialrecall2> the trick is have no life, nothing to lose
[2:02:14] <%ScreamLord> Fun Fact: If you get Amnesia, those memories are likely gone FOREVER. There is no regaining your memories. You can not regain lost memories
[2:02:18] <blue2red> OSFrog
[2:02:20] <%doc_ock_rokc> anything destroying your memory is my nightmare
[2:02:27] <%baka_sugoi> Theres and anime that did amnesia like that @PatStaresAt
[2:02:40] <DrkJP520> nightmare
[2:02:51] <%ScreamLord> Wait that wasn't fun at all
[2:02:52] <%Emperor_Machinus> I had retro grade I believe. I had my head bashed into concrete and suffered ischemic stroke due to brain swelling. It took some years for some memories to come back
[2:02:55] <+Nintokis> Amnesia always struck me as A Dark Descent Kappa
[2:02:57] <+cowardman93> I got a little bit of retrograde after getting my head hit against a pipe. Not 30 years but there's like...about a year of my life that is just gone
[2:02:58] <$realm_forge> Thanks for helping me relax pat
[2:03:02] <%BoxNavy> thanks for that downer pat :)
[2:03:04] <%YakumoYomi> Of course. They just use them as a plot contrivance.
[2:03:06] <Profmcstevie> Maybe it's cos real Amnesia is POWERFULLY depressing
[2:03:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> To be fair, this is an actual magic amnesia.
[2:03:08] <+superchronicc> you mean hollywood amnesia?
[2:03:09] <%TinyLittleDancer> Retrograde amnesia is harder to define because a lot of the damage deendson etiology, Generally speaking it hits less used memory so driving and speaking are often intact. You just wont remember what car you learned to drive in
[2:03:09] <CloniiCory> One of my high school buddies just completely lost a stretch of time after his dad died. He's doing fine, but those memories just never came back in the 10 years I've known him.
[2:03:10] <SaltyAzteca> POSE
[2:03:10] <dinnydanny777> So it's similar to Alzheimers/Dementia I guess
[2:03:12] <DickieWoodsmall_279> FUN FACT: do to the usual frontal lobe damage that comes with anterograde amnesia, people who suffer from it often lose their ability to feel fear or trepidation
[2:03:13] <skeletonkingofmanlets> Is Bayonetta british Paige?
[2:03:14] <dukenux> dab
[2:03:16] <%Buzzard42> LUL
[2:03:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL
[2:03:18] <%SirGO0SE> @ScreamLord yeah. I remember my roommate saying reading his own notes was the most surreal thing
[2:03:22] <SilverRoddo> bitterDab
[2:03:23] <+AutechreTwinAphex> hopefully Platinum's next game gets a big tech bump - these graphics betray their age
[2:03:28] <+TheBitingIrish> Video game amnesia is more like repressed memories
[2:03:30] <danknugglit> Butt
[2:03:31] <%TinyLittleDancer> It can be anywhere from semiserious to deadly serious to self limiting
[2:03:32] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @ScreamLord Quick google search says your fact is BS, theres different types of retrograde of varying degrees
[2:03:34] <%CommanderSqueaks> The fucking whimsical music.
[2:03:34] <devanmuse> FAACK twitch app didn't let me know you went live again
[2:03:35] <dukenux> Magic. Got it.
[2:03:36] <%mister___doctor> What is this music
[2:03:38] <Stipli> So GF amnesia is not accurate in FF8?
[2:03:47] <Broken_Sonex> She got that Jerma Dump Truck
[2:03:48] <%BoxNavy> nope :)
[2:03:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> awww she fixed it
[2:03:51] <dukenux> What if Luka is actually a cat turned human
[2:03:54] <%CalderGaming> Punished Cheshire
[2:03:54] <+superchronicc> bring back psel art, that age was awesome
[2:03:55] <afronooch> that bandaid tho
[2:03:55] <%cowardman93> that's magic in FF8
[2:04:00] <+superchronicc> ipxel art i mean
[2:04:00] <Jane_Lo> @AutechreTwinAphex on the switch? you can't possibly believe that?
[2:04:10] <%Monkeyweed21> what if FF8 just ended with Squall shitting his pants and screaming
[2:04:14] <SilverRoddo> I like these Fallout mechanical vehicle designs
[2:04:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats easy
[2:04:19] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[2:04:22] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Ye
[2:04:25] <+BallerSwagBro9k> Why is she shorter than him suddenly?
[2:04:25] <dukenux> "He covered wars"
[2:04:26] <%FacetiousAF> huge dump truck asses?
[2:04:29] <+AutechreTwinAphex> @Jane_Lo and that's the part that scares me - I'd almost want them not to release it on Switch and just wait for a Switch 2 - it will just look like shit compared to DMC5
[2:04:29] <Daxalog> I love that buckle extender arm thing
[2:04:34] <+Pyroclase> also they're wearing black
[2:04:35] <SaltyAzteca> Back then that was the style, yeah?
[2:04:36] <Idon__> Gotta have those arm belts in case your sleeves escape LUL
[2:04:38] <+Totally_Not_Toby> ho wmany braids does she have though
[2:04:39] <DickieWoodsmall_279> are they the SAME PERSON :O
[2:04:40] <skeletonkingofmanlets> luka looks like DMC4 Dante
[2:04:40] <LifeOntheCouch> both have ponytails
[2:04:40] <%chambatron> They both have vaginas
[2:04:41] <%mister___doctor> Is Lukas ass big too
[2:04:41] <+gnoame> So they're Nomura designs
[2:04:42] <%Dementedpenguin> @Monkeyweed21 better ending than what we got honestly
[2:04:44] <dinnydanny777> Why does she call him Cheshire? I assume it's an Alice in Wonderland reference?
[2:04:47] <+Tonku_the_Red> What's up with Platinum and the name Luka?
[2:04:51] <dukenux> oh, so Five Eyes
[2:04:51] <SlippedDisco> every main character in this game have glasses somewhere in their design as well its so good
[2:04:53] <%SirGO0SE> luka hiding the dumpy
[2:04:55] <%Tearonex> Gotta have the Nomura belts
[2:04:56] <%TimetodiveLTX> personal effects that flow in the wind
[2:05:07] <+superchronicc> would luka's new design be fine without the hat?
[2:05:09] <PanicSwytch> So they're twins! Is luka vergil
[2:05:10] <Jane_Lo> @AutechreTwinAphex well, that is a fair fear, like i loved astral chain, but boy does it suffers from switch tech
[2:05:10] <dinnydanny777> Glasses are hot
[2:05:15] <%baka_sugoi> PogChamp sbfpOmg woolieOMG
[2:05:24] <Saltmeisterr> fucking balder
[2:05:27] <olaksi> monocle, pair
[2:05:29] <%Keyd00d> D:
[2:05:29] <devanmuse> ... Two monocles?
[2:05:29] <Jane_Lo> and Kamiya fought for Bayo's glasses really hard LUL
[2:05:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> I like my glasses
[2:05:31] <dukenux> Sunglasses st night?
[2:05:35] <%cowardman93> kamiya wanted glasses, others said no, so he said MORE GLASSES
[2:05:37] <SilverRoddo> Megane Pat
[2:05:38] <artoflec> Astral Chain looks great for switch too, its probably one of the best looking gmaes on the system
[2:05:38] <SlippedDisco> LUL
[2:05:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> How many of these stories are caused by people fucking?
[2:05:39] <+AutechreTwinAphex> ironically Astral Chain did cyberpunk probably better than you know - that game... LOL
[2:05:43] <CloniiCory> They had to fight for the Glasses so may as well have it be a consistent design element.
[2:05:48] <%MechArch> A bionocle
[2:05:48] <%Buzzard42> doesn't everyone have glasses because Kamiya was deliberately spiting Sega?
[2:05:49] <ZubazRising> The Race War Chronicles
[2:05:49] <%Movemeister> The double monocle is truly the douchiest of choices
[2:05:51] <NitronStreams> Man I'd love it if he was wearing two monocles
[2:05:52] <DickieWoodsmall_279> a real douchebag would wear two matching monocles
[2:05:52] <%wydamn> My vision is augmented
[2:05:55] <rufus2k2> THEY AIN'T COMING OFF
[2:06:02] <fuji_92> it really doesnt
[2:06:03] <+superchronicc> does this title have a bloody palace equivalent?
[2:06:04] <+abrupt_abe> 2 has a better plot but both are terrible
[2:06:04] <Broken_Sonex> Oh yeah, it's fucking stupid
[2:06:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Does that mean glasses make DOUBLE asshole thing
[2:06:05] <cherubs_anonymous> It makes all the sense
[2:06:07] <SaltyAzteca> You play Bayo for the plot? LUL
[2:06:08] <Laecerelius> OH NO, THEY FUCKED!
[2:06:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NOPE
[2:06:10] <SlippedDisco> bayo plots are god awful
[2:06:11] <Idon__> Why is this so much more complicated than DMC1...?
[2:06:12] <PanicSwytch> Bay 2 connects the plot better
[2:06:14] <%BoxNavy> its just a vehicle for cool things to happen
[2:06:16] <%whyskeywolfe> Yeah it's utter nonsense.
[2:06:17] <%SirGO0SE> a monocle thats tinted like sunglasses would be the most hilarious asshole shit
[2:06:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> CAPCOM LEVEL PLOT
[2:06:17] <artoflec> yup ive played this game like 8 times and i still dont understand it
[2:06:18] <%Tearonex> What ever do you mean? LUL
[2:06:18] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> It falls apart entirely near the end
[2:06:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> with time travel
[2:06:25] <Vcom7418> Oh yeah, it makes very little sense. But I am ok with that.
[2:06:28] <Profmcstevie> Light and Dark try to control the world, light and dark had someone a naughty baby oh my
[2:06:28] <Broken_Sonex> Bayo's plot is her ASS.
[2:06:29] <%Lunaticbro > light light dark dark blah blah blah
[2:06:31] <%ssjklyco> Bayo's mother woke up to JUSTICE
[2:06:31] <+Bail_seven> whos the VO
[2:06:32] <%Morbidmort> People want power, and they fuck everything up in pursuit of it.
[2:06:33] <jackeroff3> have we encountered baby faced tentacle angel yet?
[2:06:36] <dukenux> @autechretwinaphex eh, astral chain depicted cops in even more positive light
[2:06:36] <+Bail_seven> VA*
[2:06:37] <+AutechreTwinAphex> yeah I guess in a Devil May Cry game you would never get a monologue like this - they'd be in on the joke
[2:06:37] <%AzureGale> Yuri just has a good narrator voice
[2:06:38] <+Plus_On_Black> Does it work?
[2:06:40] <SlippedDisco> LUL
[2:06:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> FAAATHER

[2:06:43] <A_CD_By_Thomas> f a t h e r
[2:06:43] <%BoxNavy> F A T H E R
[2:06:44] <+Partialrecall2> what they lack in plot they make up for in Plot
[2:06:45] <CloniiCory> Time Travel and witches. That is literally all I remember about Bayos plot lol.
[2:06:45] <Zap_Rowsdower32> FATHER
[2:06:45] <+titansloth93> This plot was very clearly backfilled at the last minute
[2:06:45] <Jane_Lo> @AutechreTwinAphex yeah, but that's doesn't help to game technical perfonmance (astral chain i mean)
[2:06:46] <super_robo_mg> FADDER
[2:06:47] <%Mrbaconator> MUTHER
[2:06:48] <BerryliciousDefinition> FATHER
[2:06:49] <%wydamn> That's probably the reason Bayo 3 has no news, because the plot is in constant rewrites
[2:06:49] <%TimetodiveLTX> the plot of bayo is learning to dodge offset
[2:06:49] <mister_z_1994> So how much is the Nero expy in 3 gonna fuck this all up?
[2:06:52] <+Tonku_the_Red> B2's secondary antagonist is freaking awesome.
[2:06:59] <%mister___doctor> FAHDUR
[2:07:00] <+MrAtheGreat> FA-DUR
[2:07:01] <SCIENCE_25> My family-family-family
[2:07:04] <dukenux> PSYCHO MANTIS?
[2:07:08] <Sunstalker> I feel like Bayonetta's universe could aboslutely share with Deadly Premonition as well.
[2:07:11] <SilverRoddo> The angels muddled things up, i suppose.
[2:07:14] <%cowardman93> the plot of bayo is angels bad! now style
[2:07:15] <dukenux> FathEEEEEEERR
[2:07:19] <tubit> Making good game lore is like telling a lie. The less you say the better :)
[2:07:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god that's so adorable.
[2:07:25] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeah
[2:07:27] <Broken_Sonex> FAMILY....Family......family.....
[2:07:30] <%ssjklyco> Yes, her imitation of "Bayo"
[2:07:33] <%BoxNavy> its cute
[2:07:34] <BerryliciousDefinition> awwwwww
[2:07:34] <+superchronicc> such a good game betrayed by both plot and level design, what a shame?
[2:07:34] <dinnydanny777> Ah yes, Bayonetta is 7 foot tall
[2:07:40] <mister_z_1994> Cereza is cool, both of them
[2:07:41] <mike2hands> Pat: dying from a deadly BRAP
[2:07:42] <%TalisKanju> @Tonku_the_Red Masked Lumen?
[2:07:42] <%cowardman93> is Cereza like 1 foot tall or something?
[2:07:43] <%baka_sugoi> idk lul
[2:07:45] <+CannonHeroBrett> @PatStaresAt you think they will ever give us a game where we play as her kinda like a grown sherry?
[2:07:45] <+AutechreTwinAphex> TBH Vanquish has a garbage story too - only Platinum game that ever had a decent story was Nier Automata and that was because of Taro
[2:07:45] <mike2hands> Gief: FATHEEEER
[2:07:46] <M0untain_wolf> Doing sick combos lol
[2:07:47] <dukenux> adorable
[2:07:51] <+doc_savage> Bayo is 7'7 lmao
[2:07:55] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:07:57] <%wydamn> She fights angels in the first one, and demons in the second one, I really hope she just fight against another concept like "order" or "entropy" in the third one.
[2:07:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> FUCKING MCGUFFIN
[2:08:00] <SaltyAzteca> McGuffin!
[2:08:01] <%BoxNavy> she lov it :)
[2:08:03] <dinnydanny777> @cowardman93 Nah Bayonetta is a giant woman LUL
[2:08:04] <Zap_Rowsdower32> Bayo is just really tall
[2:08:05] <%twistedj3ster> smash it on the ground for lolz
[2:08:06] <Broken_Sonex> God, Bayo looks like a fucking freak next to this child

[2:08:25] <%doc_ock_rokc> IF this was soul eater we'd be making a edge point
[2:08:27] <%wydamn> Bayo is a certified freak
[2:08:27] <%Keyd00d> good
[2:08:30] <%FacetiousAF> bayo being her own mom doesn't help the plot confusion
[2:08:30] <Jane_Lo> @Broken_Sonex to be fair, that's kind of a point
[2:08:33] <dukenux> mummy
[2:08:38] <dinnydanny777> :O
[2:08:38] <%cowardman93> yeah but even then Cereza barely comes up to Bayo's knees

[2:08:46] <+Plus_On_Black> I love her height

[2:09:00] <Zap_Rowsdower32> NOW I'M MOTIVATED

[2:09:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Bayo is such a dope character

[2:16:05] <Papa_Bearman> I would say you're going to read that, but you're not going to read that.
[2:16:05] <Profmcstevie> The pages of who gives a fuck
[2:16:09] <danknugglit> Only nerds read

[2:16:18] <dinnydanny777> LUL
[2:16:21] <%cowardman93> this plane is so stupid and big it should not be able to fly

[2:16:42] <dukenux> Pat, why are you so averse to reading? You're making Geordie LaForge sad
[2:16:45] <KnightOfTrousers> The plane is powered by prayers
[2:16:48] <dinnydanny777> That note explains the entire story Kappa

[2:17:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dukenux WHOSE TALKING!?
[2:17:03] <%Buzzard42> So how about that Tim Rogers Tokimeki Memorial review huh
[2:17:08] <%wydamn> but that note completely justifies all the plot holes
[2:17:14] <Papa_Bearman> oswrevCoke oswrevCoke oswrevCoke
[2:17:21] <%TimetodiveLTX> its pretty good
[2:17:35] <umbraawitch> best jeanne fight incoming
[2:17:36] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It made me feel things.
[2:17:41] <%Buzzard42> it's SIX hours long
[2:17:42] <Papa_Bearman> Wanna ride the Gjallerhorn?
[2:17:44] <%Agami23> i have no idea what that game is. is it a boomer thing?
[2:17:44] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Never heard of it
[2:17:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> READING IS BAD
[2:17:52] <jumpyhugs> 6 HOURS
[2:17:53] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> It made me feel things for six hours.
[2:17:55] <+pectusumbra> really? I haven't heard of that
[2:17:55] <%Ranryu692> never heard of it
[2:17:56] <%SirGO0SE> @Buzzard42 not long enough :(
[2:18:00] <LVL1_Scumbag> Sadly proper dating sims are kind of a dead genre
[2:18:00] <dukenux> yeah imagine not knowing what Tokimeki Memorial is
[2:18:00] <Explodincatz> pat your fooling no one
[2:18:00] <%Keyd00d> It's Tokimeki Memorial tho
[2:18:02] <%YakumoYomi> 1994
[2:18:02] <ammobasket> Time to find TF out about it
[2:18:02] <%doc_ock_rokc> -Legit doesn't know of it and feels bad-
[2:18:02] <+Over_ninek> 1994
[2:18:04] <dukenux> haha
[2:18:04] <+Totally_Not_Toby> yeah we're children, pat
[2:18:04] <+sinistersally> only in japan
[2:18:07] <danknugglit> Ok boomer
[2:18:08] <%twistedj3ster> if it's so legendary how come this is the first time I've ever heard of it
[2:18:09] <SaltyAzteca> 1994
[2:18:10] <%superc37> never heard of it. whats big deal?
[2:18:12] <%Ranryu692> was it a famicom/super famicom game?
[2:18:15] <%BallerSwagBro9k> I was born in 1993
[2:18:17] <%Ynkubus_> Dont let it set in
[2:18:17] <%whyskeywolfe> Oooh Red Letter Media just put out a Half in the Bag on Wonder Woman 1984.
[2:18:18] <%Agami23> came out a year before i was born from the looks of it
[2:18:18] <+pectusumbra> I was 4
[2:18:19] <%TimetodiveLTX> the buildup to the final encounters with shiori are extremely effective
[2:18:22] <%Buzzard42> it's 26 years old and has never gotten an english translation
[2:18:23] <NitronStreams> I've heard of it
[2:18:25] <%wydamn> @umbraawitch I was going to argue that the one on the skyscraper was the best, but then I noticed your name so you probably gave your opinion some though and I better shut up.
[2:18:25] <+sinistersally> I'm a Sentimental Graffiti person myself
[2:18:37] <%coreyyotto> Tokimeki is persona but without the dungeon crawling and also better
[2:18:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Can you believe what they're expecting you of this."
[2:18:41] <%wydamn> some thought**
[2:18:45] <+Plus_On_Black> I'm 37, sexy and I never heard of it.
[2:18:45] <%Metalwahl> i just finished his pac man video, he said it tokimeki wouldn't be nearly as long
[2:18:45] <%TinyLittleDancer> I was told it never got an english release?
[2:18:45] <Jane_Lo> i mean, i found this portal by myself
[2:18:49] <DianaTheAscian> yeah i didn't exist yet
[2:18:52] <%zeroarturia> Koji igarashi wrote for it
[2:18:59] <umbraawitch> @wydamn LOOOOL the fight on the skyscraper is pretty good but having to go through space harrier sours it a bit for me
[2:19:00] <+pectusumbra> Yeah I can't even remember someone ever mentioning it even
[2:19:01] <+ChefKef493> just run to the back of the end of the level after every fight Kappa
[2:19:16] <KnightOfTrousers> I most certainly did not have the patience to find these myself
[2:19:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> How long until Tim Roger releases a 24 hour review video?
[2:19:38] <%YakumoYomi> At this point, I'd actually think Clannad would be better known among non-Japanese folks than Tokimeki Memorial
[2:19:42] <Jane_Lo> @ChefKef493 basically what i did once i discovered it in other level that way LUL
[2:19:48] <%VoidBaronJules> Aye finally made it into tonberry
[2:19:58] <SaltyAzteca> stooone
[2:20:01] <%Buzzard42> >silver

[2:20:40] <slix3431> GOTOJAIl
[2:20:44] <%TimetodiveLTX> i had heard of tokimemo in passing, but forgot about that until i actually watched the review
[2:20:45] <%Ynkubus_> @CommanderSqueaks within a year
[2:20:51] <%YakumoYomi> Time for AUDIO JUNGLE
[2:20:52] <SlippedDisco> SourPls
[2:21:00] <%wydamn> @umbraawitch I actually enjoy the space harrier section, but I realize I'm probably in the minority. It does kind of go on a little too long.
[2:21:01] <RyuuAoi> Pat still RUST?
[2:21:05] <%TimetodiveLTX> SourPls
[2:21:22] <umbraawitch> @wydamn yeah if it was a little bit shorter then it'd like it more
[2:21:27] <%SirGO0SE> AA EE OO
[2:21:33] <%Buzzard42> the problem with the space harrier section is that it's GREAT but it's also right before the last Jeanne fight
[2:21:38] <cherubs_anonymous> They're not on fire, Pat
[2:21:40] <KnightOfTrousers> lol she's still doing the animation as if she's still holidng Cereza
[2:21:40] <+JJsAdventure> That battle theme Kreygasm

[2:28:49] <%RetroCop87> ERMAGAWD
[2:28:50] <%BoxNavy> bayo 2 next week :O
[2:28:50] <blue2red> 25
[2:28:55] <%wydamn> @Jane_Lo yeah, I wish it worked like Astral Chain, where you didn't have to S rank every encounter per chapter for it to count.
[2:28:56] <%Emperor_Machinus> Then onto Bayo 2
[2:28:57] <shotgang86> eeeeeeer not quite
[2:29:00] <PanicSwytch> Will u stream Bay 2?
[2:29:05] <thelonechris> It's almost as short as you
[2:29:05] <WonderSign> you can break the fans
[2:29:06] <LifeOntheCouch> it's not long, but it's dense with combat and unlockables
[2:29:10] <+Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt you can destroy the fans
[2:29:15] <%AzureGale> is this game worth full price
[2:29:18] <shotgang86> YES
[2:29:21] <Jane_Lo> @wydamn yeah, agreed
[2:29:22] <%BoxNavy> :) maybe
[2:29:25] <Zayasu> are you going straight into bayo after beating this or playing some other games?
[2:29:29] <Zayasu> bayo 2*
[2:29:30] <shotgang86> don't kill wveryone until you leave
[2:29:34] <paralars_> you can always kill yourself
[2:29:34] <%wydamn> I though you could destroy the fans from behind
[2:29:36] <RyuuAoi> Welp...looks like you gotta do 2 now, Pat!
[2:29:37] <%ConLin_Arts_> Who is your favorite Bayo 1 boss not counting Jubileus or Balder? Mine is Sapientia!
[2:29:38] <%RetroCop87> THEY PROBABLY INFINITE RESPAWN
[2:29:40] <%wydamn> **thought
[2:29:41] <Jane_Lo> you can destroy fans if you're behind them
[2:29:49] <%BoxNavy> but get out though
[2:29:51] <RyuuAoi> Oh shit you could beat tonight..
[2:29:52] <ChungusQuest> @Cobaltor_252 Pat can destroy the fans in any game
[2:29:53] <mister_z_1994> As long as you leave one enemy to Witch time through the fans
[2:29:53] <LifeOntheCouch> @azuregale the price goes up and down all the time, so it's hard to say
[2:29:56] <AzirothTheGreat> Don’t tell him
[2:30:03] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> yeah you can shoot the fans to leave
[2:30:05] <shotgang86> pat
[2:30:06] <dinnydanny777> Do people really dislike Bayonetta 2? I thought it was good
[2:30:15] <shotgang86> pat you're locking up yourself
[2:30:22] <%BoxNavy> pat will surely solve the riddle
[2:30:22] <bakkatohri> Most past fan in witch mode?
[2:30:25] <%CalderGaming> the real question is whether we get w101 PC (for the framerate) after bayo 2
[2:30:26] <cherubs_anonymous> @dinnydanny777 Insane people
[2:30:27] <RyuuAoi> I loved Bayo 2!
[2:30:33] <Hydrapissed> pats dead
[2:30:35] <umbraawitch> @dinnydanny777 i wasnt a huge fan
[2:30:39] <Zayasu> @dinnydanny777 yeah more hardcore players dislike the mechanics
[2:30:41] <%wydamn> You can't soft-lock yourself in here if you just do it perfect
[2:30:41] <%BoxNavy> oh my gooooood
[2:30:46] <%SirGO0SE> D: dont shoot us
[2:30:48] <%wydamn> oh no, he read chat
[2:30:57] <Jane_Lo> @dinnydanny777 it depens on what crowd you're, if you're bayo1 fan/hardcore player, you're probably not the fan and the other way around. cayse both bayo has issues
[2:30:58] <thelonechris> Pat wants to shoot his fans
[2:30:59] <%wydamn> @sirgo0se lul
[2:31:01] <SirItGoBoomAlot> DUCK AND COVER
[2:31:04] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> @dinnydanny777 It's good until the highest difficulty and then the mechanics fall apart
[2:31:08] <valriot> Because they didnt play it
[2:31:09] <shotgang86> easy bosses
[2:31:12] <%Buzzard42> Bayo 2 is good but the final boss is poop
[2:31:12] <%BoxNavy> people seem to not like it as much
[2:31:12] <BleedinActionMan> Probably cause it's easier
[2:31:13] <NitronStreams> BTW this plane was originally supposed to be a boat. That's why it has a mast.
[2:31:13] <+balouie> I love both of them
[2:31:14] <BoxNavy> i dont get it
[2:31:15] <%Keyd00d> I don't get it either
[2:31:15] <RyuuAoi> Took Woolie I minute too to realize ha
[2:31:17] <%StebTheVee> probably the hair change
[2:31:18] <%ConLin_Arts_> Bayo 2 is great but man did it lack with neat bosses
[2:31:19] <grimporio> @PatStaresAt mostly the changes to the combat design
[2:31:19] <Jane_Lo> because it's combat is broken af? it literaly works as DmC and i hate it
[2:31:20] <SomersaultJustice> cause its on the wii u
[2:31:20] <%Keyd00d> Besides the ending not being as good
[2:31:21] <umbraawitch> @valriot wat. lol
[2:31:21] <+Brickston> I think the "hardcore" fans don't like that enemies can break out of combos and that you basically have a DT
[2:31:23] <+Over_ninek> pretty much improves everything while also being more accessible
[2:31:23] <SirItGoBoomAlot> It's just because of the short hair
[2:31:24] <%whyskeywolfe> Bayo 2 is les focused, has tons of reused assets and has Loki.
[2:31:26] <+superchronicc> I hear a lot of that is in regards to the casual audience i beleive
[2:31:27] <+ChefKef493> some people don't like the story, say it's stupid
[2:31:30] <+Cobaltor_252> cowards refuse to accept that short hair Bayo is better
[2:31:31] <RyuuAoi> WHO IS SAYING THIS?!
[2:31:32] <%wydamn> CONSTANT FRRRREHTING
[2:31:32] <PanicSwytch> I prefer 2 but 1 is great
[2:31:36] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:31:40] <%TinyLittleDancer> Bayo 3 is my favorite
[2:31:42] <theloganbrand> Bayo 1 is more vertical
[2:31:46] <+Tonku_the_Red> Jeanne is the best. Most of that is because Kari Whalgren is her voice.
[2:31:47] <valriot> They didnt play it cos "nintendo console". Other than that, the ending is weaker i guess????
[2:31:49] <dinnydanny777> PogChamp
[2:31:49] <%Buzzard42> short hair bayo is very good
[2:31:51] <marvel877> They don't like Umbran Climax
[2:31:52] <%LaughingCatt> I legit enjoy 2 more
[2:31:53] <%ConLin_Arts_> I really like the gang of angel bosses in this game
[2:31:54] <%wydamn> I love the disdain in Bayo's voice in that scene
[2:31:54] <dinnydanny777> This is cool
[2:31:57] <+fetrigon> it's cuz they watched a YouTube video PepeLaugh
[2:32:00] <%BallerSwagBro9k> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:32:01] <Idon__> Just you wait till they fix all those flaws in Bayo 3 :^)
[2:32:01] <+Brickston> I disagree with it, but people complain about enemies breaking out of combos and witch time being "too necessary"
[2:32:01] <+Gragnack> well pat it removes the instant death cutscenes, everyone's favorite part of bayo 1
[2:32:01] <umbraawitch> to sum up the bayonetta 2 dislike: terrible combat, sloth's design, and jeanne being mia for 95% of the game
[2:32:03] <%Keyd00d> I sure hope 3 is good
[2:32:04] <Psyramics> I think its Weaves are worse, but witch time is better?
[2:32:05] <%BallerSwagBro9k> SourPls
[2:32:05] <Hydrapissed> bayo 3 my fav
[2:32:06] <%antares_000> Enemies break out of combos pretty often, making umbran climax the only real way to deal consistent damage
[2:32:06] <+Over_ninek> WHY DOES THIS PLANE HAVE A MAST
[2:32:06] <%ssjklyco> She clipped through that poles lip
[2:32:08] <%ConLin_Arts_> sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye sbfpYeyeye
[2:32:11] <mister_z_1994> @Cobaltor_252 Why must you make this chat a house of lies? doodStare
[2:32:11] <DickieWoodsmall_279> smash 4 is my favorite bayo game
[2:32:11] <%Keyd00d> HUH HAH
[2:32:17] <RyuuAoi> 2 was great! Same combat. Same moves. Felt different but same.
[2:32:18] <%Gragnack> Gragnack subscribed with Prime. 
[2:32:21] <%Emperor_Machinus> It's a hybrid
[2:32:23] <RyuuAoi> People complain.
[2:32:28] <+TheBitingIrish> Why does an airship have a mast
[2:32:29] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHAT IS THIS THEME?
[2:32:31] <%radda343> uh oh money ran out
[2:32:31] <%SaiyanShoto> The thing I hate the most from Bayo 2 is Loki
[2:32:33] <DianaTheAscian> Thanks for the 2020Wish @gragnack
[2:32:36] <dukenux> mummeh
[2:32:39] <%StebTheVee> I'll call Bayo "mummy"
[2:32:42] <%wydamn> This is like a plane right out of Batman the Animated Series with it's super gothic design
[2:32:44] <Idon__> "you are AAAABsolutley deLUUUUsional"
[2:32:53] <NitronStreams> They designed and animated the scene with a boat, but then at the last minute they changed it to a plane
[2:32:55] <%BoxNavy> oh no its a weird rock
[2:33:01] <%cosmosjester> a sandwich
[2:33:02] <SaltyAzteca> @StebTheVee SeemsGood
[2:33:03] <Daxalog> That rock wouldve flown away from the moving plane
[2:33:07] <Jane_Lo> @PatStaresAt bayo2 eleminated "don't repeat" combos approach and did it as DmC by just doing "the more damage you do the more combat points you earn" and witch time isn't as rewarding as in bayo1
[2:33:11] <%Buzzard42> we still need one last boss fight
[2:33:12] <%whyskeywolfe> She Rian Jonson'd her!
[2:33:15] <%Emperor_Machinus> I like this guy
[2:33:17] <+TheBitingIrish> I feel like all these slideshow bits are where they ran out of budget
[2:33:17] <%ConLin_Arts_> YEAH
[2:33:19] <%AzureGale> GET OUTTA MY HEAD CHARLES
[2:33:20] <%ConLin_Arts_> BEST BOSS
[2:33:24] <dinnydanny777> I like the idea of whoever's flying this plane seeing this LUL
[2:33:27] <PanicSwytch> This Boss battle
[2:33:27] <RyuuAoi> Plus that dumb shit kid in Bayo 2 was actually not annoying af. He was decent!
[2:33:29] <LVL1_Scumbag> Megazord?
[2:33:36] <Daxalog> rules, huh?
[2:33:36] <%wydamn> The angel is just the third wheel in this outing
[2:33:41] <%Buzzard42> the kid in Bayo 2 owns
[2:33:42] <+Pyroclase> That's such a weird plane design and I love it so much
[2:33:44] <dinnydanny777> Smashed the jaw like it was Raiden's
[2:33:49] <%radda343> oh no the money is back
[2:33:57] <Idon__> She just make an ice spear out of rain drops?
[2:33:57] <%BoxNavy> yo dog das crazy
[2:34:01] <%Gragnack> love how this is never addressed at any point
[2:34:03] <%whyskeywolfe> She'll never do that again btw
[2:34:03] <%wydamn> @Idon yes
[2:34:03] <dukenux> its super dieselpunk-y, i love it

[2:34:09] <Broken_Sonex> @dinnydanny777 "Man, this just like my Sailor Moons."
[2:34:10] <%Gragnack> bayo just has ice powers
[2:34:12] <%dashmatt> allow it
[2:34:13] <%StebTheVee> You lack hatred, Bayo
[2:34:18] <paralars_> that ice spear move is bayonettas star finger

[2:34:27] <jackeroff3> let the hate flow through you!
[2:34:28] <%wydamn> Bayo only has ice powers when she's trying to show off, which is ALMOST never
[2:34:29] <+CookieCutter007> HmmHhMM Posh
[2:34:30] <%shurtal> That's the tone of a man who sniffs his own farts
[2:34:32] <%Buzzard42> Can't imagine saying bayo 2 is bad when it has that 3rd Lumen Sage fight
[2:34:33] <%Movemeister> USE IT
[2:34:36] <%TinyLittleDancer> Is this the new star wars
[2:34:41] <RyuuAoi> Awaken the Left Eye!

[2:35:23] <%Buzzard42> @umbraawitch why would I be that last Lumen Sage fight is incredible
[2:35:28] <%wydamn> We Tekken now
[2:35:30] <OnionSnob> Lady Maria looks better than ever

[2:36:06] <marvel877> I hate how Simmons over at YoVideogames insists on calling her Jean.
[2:36:08] <dukenux> This is how Spice Girls broke up

[2:36:17] <Idon__> the most infernal demon of all... the bike.
[2:36:18] <%Emperor_Machinus> it's a hair accesory
[2:36:18] <%AzureGale> Stream ruined, time 4 new game
[2:36:20] <+HollowedIdjit> yo Lumen Sage was great, what
[2:36:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> Lumen Sage was neat in concept, but no Jeanne
[2:36:22] <%baka_sugoi> sbfpUno woolieTRASH
[2:36:24] <thelonechris> That's stupid, it's awesome
[2:36:26] <%wydamn> A hair motorcycle would probably smell bad
[2:36:29] <OnionSnob> card games on hair motorcycles
[2:36:35] <dinnydanny777> She's sitting on her own hair...? Is this a fetish again... NotLikeThis
[2:36:36] <+Brickston> so if the hair can be machines why not just make a hair railgun
[2:36:37] <+RaziWraith> Would that mean that Jeanne is riding herself in front of Bayonetta?
[2:36:42] <%Buzzard42> dang all sorts of fake fans coming out of the woodwork
[2:36:47] <KnightOfTrousers> In what universe does mounting a motorcycle in hand to hand fighting seem like a good idea?
[2:36:50] <KnightOfTrousers> Oh right, this one
[2:36:52] <mister_z_1994> @marvel877 It's "Zhonn", bot even Pat gets it right
[2:36:53] <BoneBagMel> Footage of pat actually angry?
[2:36:56] <%mister___doctor> This music
[2:36:58] <ChungusQuest> "Hair motorcycle" is not a thing I thought would ever hear or see. Thank you for broadening my horizons, Pat
[2:37:00] <+CaptainJax> Lets go Justin
[2:37:01] <umbraawitch> @Buzzard42 huh????
[2:37:03] <SaltyAzteca> used an item and still lost, easy mode for you LUL
[2:37:04] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit an enemy that you can only damage in witch time? and witch time sucks in bayo2?
[2:37:04] <paralars_> rating ruined
[2:37:05] <%BoxNavy> :)
[2:37:06] <%Movemeister> LUL
[2:37:07] <CoffeeShopA> Holy hell, are people arguing Bayo 2 is bad?
[2:37:08] <thelonechris> Dante had a motorcycle weapon
[2:37:11] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> you can't keep up the cool guy act forever
[2:37:12] <Saltmeisterr> EASY MODE
[2:37:15] <+Cobaltor_252> item AND a death? stone here we come
[2:37:21] <+HollowedIdjit> @Jane_Lo I really didn't have a problem with him
[2:37:23] <paralars_> "what a day"
[2:37:24] <%Buzzard42> @CoffeeShopA Bafflingly, yes
[2:37:24] <RyuuAoi> Lick your lollis, Pat.
[2:37:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> WutFace
[2:37:28] <marvel877> RUN INVALIDATED
[2:37:28] <+HollowedIdjit> he was a cool fight
[2:37:30] <Idon__> Bayo checkpoints are weird as hell
[2:37:33] <Capn_Trips> roses are red
[2:37:35] <Daxalog> Return to start!
[2:37:36] <KnightOfTrousers> I think this was one of the first games I ever played where "Oh god they have my moveset!!!"
[2:37:39] <%Buzzard42> what's a checkpoint
[2:37:42] <%wydamn> it actually is weird this doesn't count as its own encounter
[2:37:42] <dukenux> ohhh i se now
[2:37:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> "Good at the game"
[2:37:54] <dukenux> i see why people dislike plane now
[2:38:02] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit i mean, as jeanne maybe he is better, but as a bayo timing on witch time is just meh. but that's me i guess
[2:38:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> angel said no
[2:38:07] <dukenux> SPEEN
[2:38:07] <super_robo_mg> that's a good trick
[2:38:09] <%AzureGale> Spin 2 win
[2:38:11] <BleedinActionMan> Bayo 2 is immediately better than 1 because no instant death QTEs
[2:38:21] <+HollowedIdjit> It is you
[2:38:21] <marvel877> Bayo has checkpoints? I always restarted the entire mission because checkpoints look bad on the results screen.
[2:38:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> ye
[2:38:30] <%ConLin_Arts_> that is a big sucky in this game
[2:38:30] <+HollowedIdjit> I had fun each time I fought him
[2:38:35] <%wydamn> @dukenux to be fair, this was an optional path, if you ignore the alfheim you don't have to deal with this
[2:38:36] <%Buzzard42> nope!
[2:38:52] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit but have you pure platinum gim though? that's a different story
[2:39:06] <BleedinActionMan> There is precisely one instant kill in Bayo 2
[2:39:08] <dinnydanny777> :)
[2:39:12] <%BoxNavy> make a save state :)
[2:39:16] <%ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[2:39:22] <shotgang86> B A N G
[2:39:23] <%BoxNavy> SourPls
[2:39:26] <dukenux> you're not a true fan if you havent beat bayo start to finish with no checkpoints
[2:39:30] <%bevyrage> one instant kill... excluding QTE's
[2:39:31] <%SaiyanShoto> It’s either win or the stream is over
[2:39:31] <Profmcstevie> The classic reason to get gud: awful checkpointing
[2:39:35] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> SICK BURNS BRAH
[2:39:38] <RyuuAoi> One more death promised for sure.
[2:39:43] <%Buzzard42> SourPls
[2:39:43] <%ConLin_Arts_> Jeanne is fun even if you don't do Pure Platinum though
[2:39:53] <+HollowedIdjit> lol no, I didn't care enough to do that back then. I've been meaning to go back and play it, since it's been a long time and I loved the game
[2:40:02] <RyuuAoi> She's HBIC rn
[2:40:04] <BleedinActionMan> @bevyrage I am like 99% positive that there are no instant death QTEs in 2
[2:40:10] <RyuuAoi> AWAKEN
[2:40:26] <%ConLin_Arts_> Maybe one of Aeisirs attacks is an instakill?
[2:40:32] <%wydamn> Only a true Bayo fan would beat the game with only one-and-a-half A presses.
[2:40:33] <dukenux> VROOM
[2:40:35] <%ConLin_Arts_> i don't remember
[2:40:38] <%Emperor_Machinus> who does Jean have a pact with? Since Bayo is with lady butterfly
[2:40:39] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit in comparision to Jeanne, who's moveset you can learn and approach her with No Witch Time, you can't do same for lumen sage in bayo2 and it's terrible for pure platinum. On casual level it's a whole different story
[2:40:39] <%AzureGale> Did you just summon a bunch of fists in one turn? That's against the rules, isn't it?
[2:40:40] <%Buzzard42> PAT
[2:40:44] <paralars_> there is a demon in bayo 2 that instakills you
[2:40:51] <%walternatorz> pat discovers techniques to kill himself.. faster
[2:40:52] <umbraawitch> dont even get me started on that hamfisted loptr fight LOL
[2:40:53] <paralars_> turns you into baby bayo and eats you
[2:41:01] <BleedinActionMan> Unless you count Alaraune's soul rip
[2:41:01] <%GoogleyGareth> streamer bad
[2:41:02] <skeletonkingofmanlets> I wonder why that triumph sounds like a Honda
[2:41:04] <%ConLin_Arts_> John
[2:41:07] <Jane_Lo> @Emperor_Machinus she has her own madama
[2:41:08] <shotgang86> desgasteng
[2:41:14] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> motorcycle is the true boss
[2:41:14] <+HollowedIdjit> that's cool dude, I didn't really care, I just wanted to play the game and have fun.
[2:41:15] <BleedinActionMan> @paralars_ That is what I am reffering to
[2:41:18] <%ConLin_Arts_> Madama Styx
[2:41:19] <+HollowedIdjit> and I did lol
[2:41:22] <Daxalog> oh oh no hes in his thirties. Thats 3 with a 0. Oh no
[2:41:22] <%ConLin_Arts_> Baybeeeeeee
[2:41:26] <%wydamn> Just dodge whenever you hear Jeanne say "Burn!"
[2:41:32] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Jane_Lo But do they ever say who?
[2:41:35] <RyuuAoi> It's cool, Pat. She a BOSS.
[2:41:39] <%AzureGale> MUDAMUDAMUDA
[2:41:42] <dinnydanny777> Wait the bike is a Triumph? Even the motorcycle is English LUL
[2:41:42] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit well, that doesn't make the game balance right, you know?
[2:41:42] <dukenux> ORA ORA
[2:41:46] <%ConLin_Arts_> I was actually hoping that instead of Alarune it would have been Madama Styx that had gone haywire somehow
[2:41:51] <RyuuAoi> DS Boss basically
[2:41:52] <%ConLin_Arts_> in 2
[2:41:57] <Jane_Lo> @Emperor_Machinus Styx is her name, but i don't remember how can you find it out
[2:41:57] <paralars_> and the final boss in bayo 2 has the same move as the instakill that jubileus has, but that version doesnt actually instakill you
[2:42:07] <RyuuAoi> PAT CAN DO DIS
[2:42:13] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Jane_Lo Ah, thank you
[2:42:14] <BleedinActionMan> That's another thing I hope we get in 3
[2:42:16] <%Buzzard42> EZPZ
[2:42:22] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Nice
[2:42:22] <dukenux> JOG OFF
[2:42:28] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[2:42:33] <RyuuAoi> #WokePat
[2:42:40] <BleedinActionMan> I want to know what went down between Alaraune and Madama Butterfly
[2:42:40] <%ConLin_Arts_> would be cool to fight a Madama in 3
[2:42:53] <skeletonkingofmanlets> so, is Bayonetta 3 gettin announced soon?
[2:42:53] <NitronStreams> Oh no the Plane is sinking
[2:43:00] <Saltmeisterr> SourPls
[2:43:05] <%AzureGale> Was that an escape sequence
[2:43:08] <BleedinActionMan> Hey, pick up that file! @PatStaresAt
[2:43:12] <%BoxNavy> that was just to fuck with you
[2:43:16] <%ConLin_Arts_> she is a worried milf
[2:43:22] <dinnydanny777> How is it raining inside the plane?
[2:43:22] <RyuuAoi> WE are not ready for Bayo 3
[2:43:23] <%Agami23> cant you use durga on your feet in electric mode to walk on that shit?
[2:43:25] <dukenux> BibleThump
[2:43:28] <Profmcstevie> One last chance to kill you :)
[2:43:31] <%AzureGale> Watch out, The Rock is behind you
[2:43:33] <dukenux> damn
[2:43:33] <CoffeeShopA> @skeletonkingofmanlets Got announced about 3 years ago
[2:43:35] <HeroToxiko> it would be funny if taste the blood played during that jean fight
[2:43:38] <%StebTheVee> Or crying baby cockroaches
[2:43:41] <%ConLin_Arts_> Bayo 3 is probably super dead and is never coming out
[2:43:43] <%baka_sugoi> LUL
[2:43:45] <%Keyd00d> Just like in Face Off
[2:43:47] <Idon__> "But Sparda was a cockraoch"
[2:43:48] <BerryliciousDefinition> oh my god
[2:43:51] <dukenux> crying babies = cockroaches
[2:43:52] <%BoxNavy> bummer that theres no cockaroach boss just to fuck with her
[2:43:55] <%AzureGale> On your feet, soldier! We are leaving!
[2:43:57] <+HollowedIdjit> @Jane_Lo I'm going to be honest, I really don't care if the Boss has some unfair stuff, unless it makes it unfun. I had fun fighting Lumen Sage, I don't particularly care if he's not a "balanced" fight.
[2:44:00] <umbraawitch> @ConLin_Arts_ nah they just announced it too early
[2:44:01] <Broken_Sonex> Just like Face/Off
[2:44:05] <%Movemeister> Like that maid in Overlord
[2:44:05] <dukenux> Face....... off?
[2:44:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> like every other Nintendo game
[2:44:21] <+zeraux_> i have never been able to pull of dodge offset
[2:44:22] <RyuuAoi> Bayo 3 is like Kill Bill 3. Director is giving "The Bride" 10 years to rest.
[2:44:25] <%wydamn> @skeletonkingofmanlets *** it was announced, 1121 days ago
[2:44:25] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> just use healing items bro >:^)
[2:44:25] <KnightOfTrousers> Aw fuck I can't believe you've dun this
[2:44:27] <skeletonkingofmanlets> @CoffeeShopA you know what I meant
[2:44:38] <%Buzzard42> @HollowedIdjit I'm with you, I always thought it was a fun fight
[2:44:39] <+Caidezes> Are cockroaches Bayo's one true fear?
[2:44:47] <%Buzzard42> the "ship" is sinking oh no
[2:44:51] <%Puhff> Bayonetta suddenly becomes Bad Mojo
[2:45:05] <%wydamn> oh no, the quebecois is coming out of Pat
[2:45:14] <%ConLin_Arts_> Use items and get the stone Joe Pesci Pat!!

[2:45:27] <%BoxNavy> oh nooooo
[2:45:27] <%Agami23> the plane?
[2:45:28] <Jane_Lo> @HollowedIdjit again, you're allowed to think that, but that's doesn't make it in any way a good mechanic choice. especially in comparision to bayo1
[2:45:28] <NitronStreams> LUL
[2:45:29] <+twohitgood> boat?
[2:45:31] <%ConLin_Arts_> Ploat
[2:45:33] <%Agami23> the sky boat?

[2:45:35] <%wydamn> Before you know it, he's going to give someone the Shawinigan Handshake
[2:45:35] <dukenux> ROOSE
[2:45:37] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> exactly how the titanic went down
[2:45:39] <%Gragnack> boat
[2:45:40] <+CaptainJax> airboat
[2:45:41] <NitronStreams> I love Titanic as a verb
[2:45:44] <CoffeeShopA> @skeletonkingofmanlets Yeah I did, I'm just still sad and bitter we haven't heard anything. I think recently Kamiya said development is going smoothly though
[2:45:45] <%AzureGale> So when does Ridley show up
[2:45:50] <%ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[2:45:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> This would be hard for a non witch
[2:45:52] <%SirGO0SE> ill never let go pat :(
[2:45:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @AzureGale later
[2:46:12] <BleedinActionMan> Man, MadWorld is never getting a remaster
[2:46:12] <Jane_Lo> @CoffeeShopA he said that everytime someone asks about bayo3 development LUL
[2:46:15] <Idon__> The Titanic was caused by angels fighting witches confirmed
[2:46:25] <%ConLin_Arts_> Also one of my biggest nitpics with Bayo 2.... the soundtrack wasn't as good as 1
[2:46:33] <dukenux> there was space on that driftwood, yknow...
[2:46:36] <CoffeeShopA> @Jane_Lo Let me have some hope dammit!
[2:46:37] <%BoxNavy> i might catch some hate for thsi but this games music is great
[2:46:39] <%ConLin_Arts_> psaLiz
[2:46:43] <skeletonkingofmanlets> platinum games must be going through a real rough patch after microsoft fucked them over
[2:46:48] <%doc_ock_rokc> @BleedinActionMan Max anarchy/anarchy reigns is never coming to the pc
[2:46:56] <%wydamn> @CoffeeShopA yeah, I think that was just before Christmas, and it came with the disclaimer "I know this is almost the same announcement as last year, but..."
[2:47:04] <RyuuAoi> Well Bayo 2 is the continuation to the story. Been a minute, but I vaguely remember the story at the end of 2 wrapping up at the end
[2:47:04] <umbraawitch> @ConLin_Arts_ i agree, the soundtrack was so boring in 2
[2:47:06] <Idon__> Oh...
[2:47:06] <NitronStreams> yeaaaah
[2:47:08] <dukenux> Oh...
[2:47:11] <%BoxNavy> it should
[2:47:12] <dukenux> darn
[2:47:13] <%LaughingCatt> I HATE that is doesnt do that
[2:47:15] <DickieWoodsmall_279> all these people in denial about bayo 2 being a superior game LUL
[2:47:16] <Saltmeisterr> oh...
[2:47:17] <RyuuAoi> Guess you gotta prove me wrong, Pat!
[2:47:22] <dukenux> thats bad

[2:47:39] <%ConLin_Arts_> SAPIENTIA BAYBEEEEEEEE
[2:47:41] <Udongein_1> 2010 game design
[2:47:42] <umbraawitch> @DickieWoodsmall_279 ResidentSleeper
[2:47:46] <dukenux> i thought you were talking about the final bossfight
[2:47:48] <dinnydanny777> Old school difficulty
[2:47:54] <+zeraux_> @PatStaresAt what about father rodan?
[2:47:56] <RyuuAoi> Bayo 2 BOSS FIGHT DOE
[2:48:00] <%Emperor_Machinus> what about the space dorito wasn;t he a cool fight?
[2:48:02] <%whyskeywolfe> 4 Jean fights is too many.

[2:48:05] <RyuuAoi> FINAL
[2:48:06] <Daxalog> Whered you get that helicoptor
[2:48:10] <%ConLin_Arts_> this is my favorite both as it is fun and has a neat dang theme
[2:48:11] <Idon__> So in Luka's perspective is he just seeing a floating Cereza?
[2:48:14] <Saltmeisterr> imagine liking the thing don't like
[2:48:17] <Udongein_1> 4 jeanne fights is NOT ENOUGH
[2:48:19] <%Gragnack> 26 jean fights please
[2:48:20] <CoffeeShopA> I can agree with Bayo 2's music not being as strong. Doesn't have Fly Me to the Moon for starters
[2:48:23] <RyuuAoi> @whyskeywolfe But she's Vergil...

[2:49:32] <RyuuAoi> Y'all ain't seen Bayo?! Jesus. God bless you, Pat. For the children!
[2:49:33] <DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt hows the switch port?
[2:49:35] <%wydamn> back in 2010, when you still had non-garbage reflexes
[2:49:39] <%ConLin_Arts_> and then Wii U and then Switch
[2:49:40] <jackeroff3> I love that bayo is tired of the exposition of the angels
[2:49:41] <+Sendrak70> @PatStaresAt You should play Elex. Its awful.
[2:49:48] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I love all the mechanical bits with writing on his bod
[2:50:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> yeh he is rad
[2:50:03] <%Maids4lyfe> Bayo angels are great
[2:50:04] <%Agami23> man fuck the PS3 port of this game

[2:50:14] <RyuuAoi> Wii U was fine tbh
[2:50:15] <tubit> Radical!
[2:50:16] <%Buzzard42> SURFING BATTLE
[2:50:18] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @PatStaresAt Think we'll be able to beat Bayo tonight?
[2:50:20] <+pectusumbra> makes me think of Automata for some reason
[2:50:20] <therefortomorrow> It makes me sad that Bayo is only known as that broken smash character
[2:50:21] <Idon__> Surfonetta PogChamp
[2:50:23] <dinnydanny777> ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND SingsNote
[2:50:23] <%Ynkubus_> BUT SURFING!
[2:50:23] <SlippedDisco> god i sucked at this fight
[2:50:28] <%walternatorz> @PatStaresAt is this what you referred to as the "boat fight?"
[2:50:29] <%ConLin_Arts_> THIS THEME
[2:50:30] <%wydamn> I'm almost the same age as Pat, but I've never had decent reflexes. I could reliable land in the top 4 when playing smash bros melee while getting drunk in college, though.
[2:50:33] <RyuuAoi> Oh THIS GUY

[2:51:01] <%ElkRiverDog> I really like how a lot of the bosses talk with an upside down head
[2:51:03] <+zeraux_> pats playing on hard mode right?
[2:51:07] <%ConLin_Arts_> SourPls
[2:51:15] <+Pyroclase> This is a weird mashup of DMC and that lake monster boss fight from RE4
[2:51:15] <%ConLin_Arts_> Normal
[2:51:25] <%ConLin_Arts_> as it is a new save, no hard unlocked
[2:51:26] <RyuuAoi> Don't let the smooth taste fool ya. He a beast!

[2:52:12] <Daxalog> Do it again!
[2:52:12] <%wydamn> I fucking love the music for this fight, the downward arpeggios on the piano are great

[2:52:19] <%zeroarturia> Legally distinct Phantom
[2:52:23] <RyuuAoi> Bayo be naked af doe
[2:52:25] <+RayDaug> @PatStaresAt is the switch or PC port better?
[2:52:27] <xilmarinenx> Are both games 60FPS on Switch?
[2:52:29] <stardustcrusad3r> he shoulda been in dmc 5 phantombros we were robbed
[2:52:32] <A_CD_By_Thomas> All our fault
[2:52:32] <therefortomorrow> Rub that screen!
[2:52:35] <LVL1_Scumbag> Phantom is disappoint
[2:52:39] <+Plus_On_Black> don't you mean Jam
[2:52:45] <NitronStreams> Phantasmaraneae
[2:52:48] <Noogiez> all jam's fault
[2:52:48] <CoffeeShopA> Is that why phantom wasn't in DMC5? Too busy kicking ass with Bayo?
[2:52:51] <KeiPrime> jam cloudberry
[2:52:52] <+IrishWeegee> forgive us pat-chan
[2:52:59] <%ConLin_Arts_> PUNCH
[2:53:00] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @stardustcrusad3r he's the the V manga
[2:53:03] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Screm
[2:53:03] <DianaTheAscian> shark angel is cool
[2:53:06] <%TalisKanju> Isn't every version except the PS3 version 60 FPS?
[2:53:07] <Jane_Lo> @RayDaug PC is def, but the switch one is also nice, it's really close to xbox360 much more than to ps3/wiiu
[2:53:12] <RyuuAoi> This is even on the PS4. If you haven't played, what're you doing with your life?
[2:53:18] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> So good we couldn't bring him back for DMC V.
[2:53:19] <RyuuAoi> PS3
[2:53:28] <%ConLin_Arts_> the Choir is so raaad
[2:53:34] <%SirGO0SE> i didnt know pat started windwaker
[2:53:36] <heartlesshealer> @Patstaresat people mentioning it's Phantom's Mom via interview
[2:53:37] <Jane_Lo> @TalisKanju well, 60 fps* but with some areas expierncing lag, but not on PC
[2:53:40] <%BoxNavy> its crazy hes not there
[2:53:44] <%LaughingCatt> We should have had King Phantom
[2:53:47] <xilmarinenx> Does Bayo 2 run well on Switch?
[2:53:51] <%wydamn> @CoffeeShopA headcanon 4Head
[2:53:51] <Daxalog> Phantom will always be in your heart
[2:53:52] <+zeraux_> hey what weapon would phantom turn into?
[2:53:53] <jackeroff3> Also Dante and Vergil kicking the shit out of Mundus
[2:53:53] <%DakotaMacDoodle> The manga explains why he isn't in it
[2:53:53] <user_naim> They did the water pretty good in this
[2:53:53] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Hey, he appeared in the manga at least.
[2:53:54] <%Agami23> phantom should have been the cane
[2:53:55] <+mashinchaserr> didn't he die in the manga?
[2:53:56] <+CaptainJax> What about Gigapepde?
[2:54:02] <%Monkeyweed21> @LaughingCatt Phantom Queen
[2:54:02] <heartlesshealer> so even stronger than phantom
[2:54:03] <%ConLin_Arts_> I believe one of the biggest problems with the PS3 version was the loadtimes
[2:54:03] <CoffeeShopA> @SirGO0SE I WISH Windwaker played like this
[2:54:04] <DianaTheAscian> its weird how hes not there
[2:54:07] <%superc37> i imagine it had to have been a technical thing right?
[2:54:10] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Yep. Eats shit super hard.
[2:54:13] <%ElkRiverDog> He honestly should have taken nidhoggs spot
[2:54:17] <BleedinActionMan> @zeraux_ A flamethrower
[2:54:18] <%superc37> also ye hes in the manga
[2:54:23] <%deathscythe122887> @PatStaresAt I wanted V to ride Phantom for his movement instead of Shadow
[2:54:23] <+RayDaug> @Jane_Lo Thanks. I already have the PC version but haven't played it. If the Switch version is good I might spring for that so I can have 1 & 2 at the same place.
[2:54:25] <%LaughingCatt> @Monkeyweed21 PogChamp
[2:54:27] <+ImpHelpSingIt> is she surfing on a cell phone
[2:54:28] <Saltmeisterr> wait theres a DMC manga?
[2:54:29] <%superc37> he tells V to go fuck himself
[2:54:30] <%DakotaMacDoodle> yeah in the first volume
[2:54:37] <jackeroff3> just picture dante, vergil, and sparda's spirit bullying mundus
[2:54:43] <Jane_Lo> @ConLin_Arts_ loading is fine, but the fps is worse, it's not even consistent 30 fps, it's like less than 20 sometimes
[2:54:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> yeah he tells V to fuck off and stop being a pussy
[2:54:44] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Phantom hayes V
[2:54:48] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yeye

[3:05:23] <shotgang86> like oh my god my thumb
[3:05:23] <%TalisKanju> Just like Space Harrier
[3:05:23] <%Ranryu692> this mission hurt my wrists so much
[3:05:25] <%BoxNavy> WutFace
[3:05:26] <dukenux> ow my epilepsy bone
[3:05:26] <RyuuAoi> This beat slaps!
[3:05:28] <%Emperor_Machinus> Mashlord Pat can do it though
[3:05:31] <+infinite_rotation> Its cool but it goes on for way to damn long
[3:05:31] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> GET BETTER STREAMER
[3:05:32] <Winner_92> i never understood why games made you mash instead of holding the button fuck that shit
[3:05:32] <+Greywyn00> just witch time more :)
[3:05:34] <%Divryne> UH OH MOTION SICKNESS.
[3:05:35] <%Buzzard42> yeah this is AWFUL to play
[3:05:36] <Profmcstevie> also the dodges are a full 360 spin WHEEE motion sickness
[3:05:37] <therefortomorrow> I mean it’s identical to Space Harrier
[3:05:38] <Nordguy> dont you havw turbo on your controller, Pat???
[3:05:38] <+JJsAdventure> weird i dont remember this
[3:05:38] <+Sendrak70> Its just like Fantasy Zone. Same problem.
[3:05:39] <ItsJustThatSimp_le> you also have to dodge constantly at some points and it makes me want to hurl
[3:05:42] <%ConLin_Arts_> I don't remember how the one in 2 played
[3:05:42] <bakkatohri> Getting that Space Harrier CP in Y0 was soooo boring
[3:05:43] <RyuuAoi> ITS A VIDJA GAME, PAT
[3:05:47] <LVL1_Scumbag> Welcome to the Fantasy Zone!
[3:05:48] <fuji_92> are you the master at mashing pat, just do it 4Head
[3:05:48] <@commanderclaw> The 360 era loved mashing and QTEs
[3:05:50] <%QuipSan> Kreygasm
[3:05:52] <Jane_Lo> not this evade animation bawkOmega
[3:05:54] <%wydamn> WEAK
[3:05:55] <DianaTheAscian> oh god the flips
[3:05:57] <dinnydanny777> Oh god that camera spin is uncomfortable LUL
[3:06:00] <rytisone> cant you just hold?
[3:06:01] <%TalisKanju> Rolling is the WORST
[3:06:01] <%BoxNavy> im going to puke all over my desk if you do one more dodge
[3:06:02] <raveous> just get a turbo controller you coward
[3:06:04] <dinnydanny777> I already feel dizzy LUL
[3:06:05] <mike2hands> OMG THIS ROTATION camara is fucking garbage , MY EYES
[3:06:07] <%Pappajimbo> if your not suffring your not playing correctly
[3:06:08] <shotgang86> mash a lot is a stupid thing that I'm glad most games don't have nowadays
[3:06:09] <bakkatohri> IT EVEN HAS THE MUSIC
[3:06:12] <umbraawitch> the dodge animation makes my head hurt
[3:06:15] <dan_g_v> regain strenght by petting the pets, doggo and mcdumpster
[3:06:16] <heartlesshealer> I like how because you're riding a missile, witch time is your health
[3:06:18] <%Buzzard42> it's an accurate remake of Space Harrier at least
[3:06:19] <fuji_92> yall sick yet LUL
[3:06:29] <Daxalog> Isnt their a lock on that would help?
[3:06:32] <%wydamn> To be fair, could you even play a First person version of Bayonetta?
[3:06:35] <%Mahbonk> god it's incredible how the shooter segment in 2 is much better
[3:06:36] <%SaiyanShoto> Oh god doodBarf doodBarf doodBarf doodBarf
[3:06:37] <sonicblade38> my eye!
[3:06:42] <RyuuAoi> Very Sega
[3:06:42] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Unpopular opinion: This is my favorite level. I feel like the fight at the end more than makes up for the Space Harrier part
[3:06:46] <Winner_92> it's really just a fuck you to anyone going for pure plat
[3:06:46] <%whyskeywolfe> It's a really weird stage to have at the very end of the game.
[3:06:48] <RyuuAoi> Sonic Music
[3:06:50] <dinnydanny777> The camera spin is like they WANTED to make people feel motion sick LUL
[3:06:50] <SlippedDisco> SourPls
[3:06:55] <%Emperor_Machinus> @commanderclaw Yeah they loved cause it meant more controllers sold from breaking them due to mashing or QTE rage
[3:07:05] <+JJsAdventure> wow
[3:07:16] <%Dementedpenguin> And it KEEPS GOING
[3:07:18] <RyuuAoi> Cyberpunk Bayo
[3:07:19] <+Greywyn00> can you not just hold down the button?
[3:07:20] <%twistedj3ster> ...I find the camera spin soothing
[3:07:24] <%BoxNavy> cool flashing :)
[3:07:29] <bakkatohri> YOU'RE DOING GREAT
[3:07:30] <shotgang86> goddamn pat can MASH
[3:07:34] <%coreyyotto> I don't think you guys understand, Kamiya literally won't sign off on a game unless the second to last level is a Space Harrier clone.
[3:07:39] <%ConLin_Arts_> that reminds me, I need to get new Joy Cons as one of the ones I have is drifting like crazy
[3:07:42] <Laecerelius> I hate that spin.
[3:07:43] <Winner_92> the camera spin is just so god damn unnecessary
[3:07:44] <+fetrigon> it wasn't already real stupid? LUL
[3:07:44] <Saltmeisterr> WHY
[3:07:47] <Saltmeisterr> WHYYYYYY
[3:07:47] <Jane_Lo> you can change them though
[3:07:47] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt You can un-invert them
[3:07:48] <shotgang86> Paige whats your opinion on Pat's mashing abilities?
[3:07:50] <%wydamn> @twistedj3ster yeah, you have to be zen about it. It's not you that's spinning, it's the world that's spinning
[3:07:51] <+RayDaug> because you're flying
[3:07:51] <%baka_sugoi> camera angle is trash
[3:07:51] <mike2hands> BOOMER EYES
[3:07:51] <SlippedDisco> ok yeah now i feel dizzy
[3:07:52] <+TungstenViper> Flying NEEDS inverted
[3:07:52] <mike2hands> same
[3:07:53] <%Mahbonk> there's nothing to understand
[3:07:54] <rytisone> just like in the end of dmc 1
[3:07:55] <umbraawitch> this should have ended after temperantia
[3:07:55] <+fetrigon> actual cancer wtf
[3:07:57] <Idon__> wow, and I thought the shmup sections in Nier Automata were long...
[3:07:57] <jackeroff3> bayo is gamer girl confirmed
[3:07:57] <+Greywyn00> I LOVE the spin
[3:08:01] <@commanderclaw> I feel like Bayonetta is a great game that's aged poorly
[3:08:01] <%TalisKanju> Because Space Harrier
[3:08:02] <fuji_92> why tha heck not right LUL
[3:08:04] <wembleyttv> I think Fantasy zone was inverted
[3:08:04] <%Mahbonk> oh good a decent break from this shitfest
[3:08:06] <Saltmeisterr> WAIT WHERE IS BABY?
[3:08:06] <%BoxNavy> this level is trying to make you throw up and have a seizure
[3:08:08] <%WhereIsWill> that spin is cool and the WORST
[3:08:12] <%wydamn> I also like inverted controls, so maybe that's why I'm one of the few people that don't mind this stage
[3:08:16] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Ya know, this might legitimately be among my favorite stages. I like Space Harrier, and the sick boss fight is a great bonus
[3:08:22] <Winner_92> the good parts of bayonetta are really good but the bad parts of bayonetta fuckin suck
[3:08:23] <dinnydanny777> This part is cool though
[3:08:25] <+TungstenViper> Flying games need inverted controls. you're STEERING
[3:08:26] <Idon__> why... why are we still going
[3:08:31] <+smuggleruncle> for flying i find inverted works for me
[3:08:33] <dinnydanny777> Fighting on the rocket is pretty cool
[3:08:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> a 2.5 Bayonetta seems like it would be cool
[3:08:47] <%Emperor_Machinus> 2.5D
[3:08:52] <%wydamn> @valentinius_anodyne hell yeah man
[3:08:53] <heartlesshealer> SingsNote SingsNote SingsNote
[3:08:56] <Profmcstevie> Kamiya games are king of taking something fun and over staying it's welcome huh
[3:08:57] <dinnydanny777> It's not lenient on your eyes NotLikeThis LUL
[3:09:04] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt If you hit Select, you can make it so it has normal controls
[3:09:10] <paralars_> oh hey fortitudo number 42 LUL
[3:09:12] <%Mahbonk> 2.5 is kinda cool yeah
[3:09:13] <%Aydarkzero> oh so now 2.5 is cool Kappa
[3:09:16] <%wydamn> this is like 50%
[3:09:17] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Or L, rather
[3:09:19] <+KiwiRedgrave> this shit is like 30 minutes long and gets so old so fast
[3:09:22] <Idon__> I am going to seriously vomit
[3:09:25] <Idon__> WHAT
[3:09:28] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[3:09:28] <+Greywyn00> :)
[3:09:29] <%rekinom> I have to look away from the screen every few seconds to keep from getting sick
[3:09:29] <dinnydanny777> NotLikeThis
[3:09:30] <Idon__> there's more?
[3:09:31] <heartlesshealer> bye crystal dragon jesus
[3:09:32] <%WhereIsWill> oh.....oh NO
[3:09:34] <PaPaSeppuku> FUCK
[3:09:35] <%Deano8817> oh jesus I thought that was the end LUL
[3:09:35] <+fetrigon> @emperor_machinus Play Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin if you want an entire game like that
[3:09:36] <fuji_92> LUL YEYEYEYE
[3:09:36] <%Mahbonk> oh boy...
[3:09:38] <%AzureGale> Wowowowowowowowowowow

[3:09:45] <Jane_Lo> just don't get hit Kappa
[3:09:45] <%BoxNavy> 1 of 2, right? :)
[3:09:48] <+fetrigon> did he say first?
[3:09:50] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @PatStaresAt Think you'll be able to finish Bayo tonight, or will we need another session?
[3:09:53] <MintyKush> i remember really DESPISING this bayoneta chapter
[3:09:53] <+JJsAdventure> my eyes adjusted 👀
[3:09:55] <DickieWoodsmall_279> we're in it for the long haul boys
[3:09:59] <%crazyspartan214> VER !?
[3:10:01] <%Monkeyweed21> BTW witch time makes this take longer
[3:10:01] <Winner_92> this stage and the stage later where you have to use the turrets are why i will never go for pure plat on this game
[3:10:02] <RyuuAoi> Oh this a WHOLE level, BOIS
[3:10:03] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Everything in bayo overstays its welcome. But you get used to it
[3:10:04] <%rekinom> Every time he does a spin I get dizzy
[3:10:04] <%wydamn> This really reminds me of Aquarius from Star Fox 64
[3:10:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> @fetrigon I pre-ordered it, but my game got lost in the mail
[3:10:17] <RyuuAoi> GET IN
[3:10:18] <fuji_92> 2 outta 10 Kappa
[3:10:18] <%Mahbonk> yay more 2.5D
[3:10:20] <%wydamn> Or not Aquarius, whatever the garbage planet was
[3:10:23] <user_naim> Man I forgot
[3:10:24] <wembleyttv> Does the whole cam need to spin as well?
[3:10:27] <+fetrigon> @ryuuaoi fuck oooooofffff
[3:10:31] <+TungstenViper> Shmups noobs LUL
[3:10:34] <+fetrigon> no fucking way
[3:10:37] <heartlesshealer> Venom or something for the trash planet
[3:10:38] <kekleon020> I can't finish this game I get tired
[3:10:41] <dinnydanny777> This reminds me of that flying part near the end of Kingdom Hearts 2, where it lasts for like 2 minutes but this is so much worse LUL
[3:10:42] <+Greywyn00> you NEED it
[3:10:47] <paralars_> 2.5D bayonetta is just smash bros
[3:10:48] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> THE GLASSES STAY ON.
[3:10:49] <Idon__> I will never shittalk Nier Automata mech sections again LUL
[3:11:06] <%Emperor_Machinus> Not a true experience only you feel violently sea sick
[3:11:19] <+CaptainJax> its STILL going?
[3:11:28] <%Mahbonk> tbh hacking in automata does overstays its welcome as well
[3:11:29] <CoffeeShopA> God this is so much more nauseating than I remember
[3:11:32] <+Greywyn00> chat should I play NIER automata or FF7R?
[3:11:32] <Bonte__> oh yes.
[3:11:32] <wembleyttv> 15 min mission?
[3:11:36] <%WhereIsWill> this would be a million times better if you could just hold to shoot
[3:11:36] <%Monkeyweed21> oh you sweet souls
[3:11:36] <+fetrigon> wtf
[3:11:37] <Bonte__> and it will continue to go @CaptainJax

[3:11:44] <%M3djedx> psaBig
[3:11:45] <PrinceOfEden> Remember guys, they saw this and then thought "We could do starfox too."
[3:11:49] <+balouie> I forget how much I like the music
[3:11:56] <Clundy> Bayonetta Missle Ride VR Mission
[3:11:58] <+TungstenViper> so i get chat never played After Burner Climax?
[3:12:12] <umbraawitch> @PrinceOfEden funny because they did make a starfox game
[3:12:25] <Clundy> That big ole hunk of arcade space stole so much of my money
[3:12:31] <PrinceOfEden> @umbraawitch ...That's what I was referring too.
[3:12:32] <+balouie> did wonderful 101 have a shooting stage like this
[3:12:33] <Hydrapissed> Ring fit for core bayo for arms lol
[3:12:34] <PrinceOfEden> cmonBruh
[3:12:47] <Jane_Lo> @TungstenViper fun fact - the track for this called "after burner"
[3:12:47] <NitronStreams> I wish it at least had some Star Fox-esque banter
[3:12:48] <rytisone> I never knew you can fire faster here, and I platinumed this stage
[3:12:52] <ZippyPsycho> @balouie Yes
[3:12:52] <%Mahbonk> half way there
[3:12:53] <+CaptainJax> @balouie It had like 5
[3:12:54] <umbraawitch> @PrinceOfEden OH i thought you meant they tried to make a bootleg star fox and put it in bayo 2
[3:12:55] <dinnydanny777> Kappa
[3:12:57] <CloniiCory> This is still going huh?
[3:12:58] <ZippyPsycho> Kamiya loves Space Harrier

[3:13:15] <Spudnacious_Dynasty> This missile is 100% fuel
[3:13:15] <dinnydanny777> Does this health carry over into the actual stage...? NotLikeThis
[3:13:16] <wembleyttv> It been like 5 years since I played this on steam
[3:13:17] <PaPaSeppuku> "mmm love me some BARF with my space harrier" - SEGA
[3:13:17] <+balouie> I thought so cant remember worth crap

[3:14:16] <%Ynkubus_> But wait... Theres more
[3:14:16] <HeroToxiko> this is just the gummi ship all over again LUL
[3:14:18] <+TungstenViper> Imagine having such a badass hot mom. Both Kreygasm and pareWEIRD
[3:14:18] <%Spydurman> half????
[3:14:19] <RyuuAoi> It's not that bad! Play DMC 2!!
[3:14:21] <Idon__> OH GOD

[3:14:23] <TonberryLives> OH BOY AM I
[3:14:24] <%Mahbonk> We all want to forget about this stage
[3:14:31] <Noogiez> would be cool if there was a shot counter
[3:14:32] <dinnydanny777> It really is the Gummi Ship LUL
[3:14:33] <simbadg13> who thought this was a good idea for a level? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING
[3:14:34] <+KiwiRedgrave> except not really
[3:14:38] <NitronStreams> Enemy Shields Analyzed
[3:14:40] <Saltmeisterr> SPEEEEEN
[3:14:42] <+TungstenViper> DO YOU UDNERSTAND?
[3:14:43] <Profmcstevie> ONE MORE TIME, TEMPRANCE EVERYONE
[3:14:43] <HeroToxiko> @RyuuAoi dmc2 didn
[3:14:44] <%Spydurman> This works as like a 2-3 stage with 1 boss but overstays its welcome
[3:14:45] <%wydamn> Oh fuck he's right, I thought this was the end here
[3:14:48] <UltimateDomon> The Gummi Ship never got this bad
[3:14:52] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Daxalog) (warning)
[3:14:56] <umbraawitch> this level could've ended right here and it would've been perfectly fine
[3:14:56] <+fetrigon> omfg 🤢
[3:15:02] <Clundy> It’s Regi-Steel!
[3:15:03] <HeroToxiko> @RyuuAoi dmc2 didn't have a mandatory gummy ship level
[3:15:09] <wembleyttv> Oh yeah the boss rush shit
[3:15:09] <+MrAtheGreat> Is slippy cereza or luca here?
[3:15:10] <olaksi> oh no gummy ship had spacing
[3:15:11] <+Greywyn00> is this secretly a boss rush?
[3:15:12] <Hydrapissed> less then half hp now
[3:15:13] <Daxalog> isTemperanceInJail should be a website
[3:15:16] <+TungstenViper> i suppose Woolie really liked this part. right?
[3:15:17] <%charp35> someone needs to stop Kamiya when he wants to put a classic game section in or tell him to cut them down
[3:15:22] <RyuuAoi> Melting his life bar!
[3:15:26] <+shattywack> I feel like this was done much better in Bayo 2 but it was also like a fraction of the length. This is just brutal long
[3:15:30] <DrkJP520> Protip: do NOT play this stage with a joycon in each hand. I almost didn't survive.
[3:15:32] <shotgang86> how much can this man mash jesus
[3:15:33] <dinnydanny777> Is Cereza okay?
[3:15:36] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> Temperance? But that wasn't Estarriola! This is for no one!
[3:15:36] <dan_g_v> pure platinum
[3:15:37] <BleedinActionMan> And now for the best boss in the game!
[3:15:37] <+CaptainJax> Halfway there PogChamp

[3:16:43] <%radda343> did Jenne know in her blood that Bayo was riding a missile
[3:16:47] <%watts121> it's the best Dante vs Vergil fight...but you have to play space harrier to see it.
[3:16:50] <kekleon020> I thought we play video games for fun

[3:17:07] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @watts121 What's the downside?
[3:17:08] <+MrAtheGreat> You know, you could have played banjo kazooie
[3:17:10] <HeroToxiko> To take me out you must fight like an umbral witch, *industrial dance remix*
[3:17:14] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I love that this giant ass city full of missiles is just meant for this one face off LUL
[3:17:15] <paralars_> bayo 2 did the same thing but with the final boss... at least that shmup section isnt as long
[3:17:21] <wembleyttv> Wait your telling me like with metal gear rising when that got released on PC they had the boss select mode. When Bayonetta came out on the switch THEY DID NOT ADD IT
[3:17:24] <+RenoDeGeneric> WITCH MISSILES
[3:17:25] <+CaptainJax> wait what are they nuking?
[3:17:25] <wembleyttv> WTF
[3:17:26] <+Over_ninek> could you imagine
[3:17:26] <%mastertwin2> is this lonesome road
[3:17:31] <Jane_Lo> @umbraawitch did people try to remove it for PC?
[3:17:31] <+KiwiRedgrave> Bayos story makes no fucking sense sometimes
[3:17:35] <shotgang86> and then a Lumen Sage said "but that umbra boot though"
[3:17:38] <NitronStreams> You must not cross the streams
[3:17:38] <+SaltyGhostRock> D:

[3:17:45] <+MrAtheGreat> YOU CANT TELL MNE NOT TO BONE IM A SKELETON MAN
[3:17:45] <umbraawitch> @Jane_Lo i have no clue i hope they did though
[3:17:46] <mister_z_1994> Bayo and Rosa literally went to horny jail
[3:17:50] <Jane_Lo> @umbraawitch i suppose you can always at least use cheats to not die/get damage or something
[3:17:51] <%twistedj3ster> SHE COULD HAVE SAID THAT SO LONG AGO
[3:17:53] <+Br0kuyasu> that makes bayo a gmilf?
[3:17:56] <kekleon020> she looks ok for being over 500 yrs
[3:18:00] <Nordguy> bruh she aaaancient
[3:18:00] <+CaptainJax> maybe they shouldnt have been so hot if they didnt want the sages so horny
[3:18:01] <%Maids4lyfe> HOW MANY MISSILES DID SHE HAVE
[3:18:05] <RyuuAoi> LORE
[3:18:08] <Hydrapissed> I mean maybe she fucked him ya dont know

[3:18:23] <KeiPrime> horney jail
[3:18:24] <DickieWoodsmall_279> clearly he was seduced
[3:18:36] <RyuuAoi> Makes sense...
[3:18:37] <godzookylives> A clan of incels
[3:18:39] <Eightesu> seems reasonable
[3:18:39] <Sunstalker> She's existed for 500 years, I think it's fine
[3:18:40] <umbraawitch> i mean if you look at rosa in bayo 2 can you blame balder
[3:18:43] <%SaiyanShoto> They were just jealous because he got some good witch coochie
[3:18:49] <+theoriginalbigboy3535> How many stories would not exist if someone just hadn't fucked
[3:18:52] <%crazyspartan214> off to horny hell guys

[3:27:56] <Daxalog> I was kinda expecting this fight to do more tbh.
[3:27:57] <+MrAtheGreat> is it just me or does any one else feel the hold attacks are more defensive. Like, because you're not tapping it's easier to time the dodge?
[3:28:17] <godzookylives> Maybe this year we'll finally see something of Bayo 3

[3:33:42] <%Sweetangy021> I hate that quote because even getting the opportunity is luck
[3:33:44] <%twistedj3ster> her back is prolly freezing
[3:33:44] <KeiPrime> look at that sashay tho
[3:33:47] <dukenux> Bayo is the one actually holding the weiner
[3:33:47] <%Alazull> look you gotta shape up, cause bayo barely needs a man
[3:33:48] <RyuuAoi> You'll find out in PART 2
[3:33:48] <%Ne1son> But who is Cereza?
[3:33:49] <%AXL808> quite the tone shift from your childhood blown to pieces
[3:33:50] <IminyourBase> luck is just random chance. opportunity + preparedness is just foresight

[3:35:51] <Profmcstevie> CREATE THE MASH
[3:35:52] <Vyneci> YEYEYEYEYE I DO THAT TOO
[3:35:52] <%twistedj3ster> I use my forearm, but the principle is the same
[3:35:52] <%GalacticaPhanto> @maxarthos bro you sure you got the right personm
[3:35:53] <%SirGO0SE> then vibrate hard
[3:35:54] <HeroToxiko> you basically cause a spasm LUL
[3:35:55] <+b_aleph> gainz
[3:35:55] <%averyoddjew> vibrate your arm

[3:35:57] <Vyneci> MY ARM HURTS SO BAD
[3:35:57] <SaltyAzteca> That stand power tho
[3:35:57] <+gnoame> masturbate the controller
[3:35:59] <%whyskeywolfe> By the way: don't do this.
[3:35:59] <bettysharkface> Oh you activate vibration mode
[3:36:00] <shotgang86> yeyeyeyeye
[3:36:01] <+Over_ninek> someone clip this
[3:36:01] <%WhereIsWill> look at the FPS on that arm PogChamp
[3:36:01] <%coreyyotto> Cocaine optional!
[3:36:01] <DickieWoodsmall_279> so it's like jitter clicking
[3:36:03] <%Sol_Install> YEYEYYEYYE
[3:36:05] <%Emperor_Machinus> I can jsut make my wrist do the twitch by twisting.
[3:36:05] <+gitgouda> yes i have never so accurately described.
[3:36:06] <%Sol_Install> THAT HOW I DO IT
[3:36:06] <dukenux> i do tge same but with index
[3:36:06] <olaksi> but what if i just press the button
[3:36:07] <%SirGO0SE> i cant believe other people use this technique LUL
[3:36:08] <%Nekros4442> BasicBasically make ur arm spasm
[3:36:08] <+RJay80> got to open some inner gates to mash
[3:36:08] <kushmasta_> pat teaches us how to treat a lady
[3:36:09] <%baka_sugoi> i actually mash like that sometimes
[3:36:10] <shotgang86> YEYEYEYEYEYYE
[3:36:11] <skeletonkingofmanlets> pat teaCHING THE SECRETS OF ALTERNATE PICKING
[3:36:13] <+RenoDeGeneric> Hell yeah that's what I used to beat everybody with
[3:36:14] <%SirGO0SE> Pat you ever do the sliding mash?
[3:36:15] <%Pyr0_Fr0st> The 5.3 trail in FF14 killed my thumbs
[3:36:15] <%Nekros4442> Thats super accurate
[3:36:16] <%averyoddjew> it's a workout
[3:36:16] <paralars_> Pat's got that Sweet Surrender LUL
[3:36:16] <shotgang86> that's how I do it
[3:36:18] <+BettyMwwaahh> @PatStaresAt I think i saw your after image
[3:36:18] <Profmcstevie> Berserker style
[3:36:19] <Vyneci> IT'S FUCKING AWFUL
[3:36:19] <%invisi_bliss> lol I do that LUL
[3:36:19] <bleugh> yea that's how i do it
[3:36:20] <+TungstenViper> BIG BICEPS
[3:36:20] <%Mrbaconator> TRADE HP FOR POWER
[3:36:20] <laserbeaming> This is Super Masher 1. This is Super Masher 2. AND THIS IS TO GO FURTHER BEYOOOOOOND
[3:36:21] <+Cobaltor_252> I'd rather keep a functioning arm
[3:36:21] <%BoxNavy> its not meant for humans to do
[3:36:21] <SlippedDisco> oh my god! today i learnt
[3:36:21] <user_naim> This is fucked LUL
[3:36:21] <shotgang86> and it fucking SUCKS
[3:36:22] <%ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt That's what I've done for years
[3:36:22] <%CapnClassix> Spoon Trick but with knuckle
[3:36:24] <ancrest_tant> You basically induce muscle spasms
[3:36:25] <IminyourBase> it's tough being a real gamer
[3:36:25] <+EroHoney> Pat I hurt myself doing it for 1 second. You owe me compensation
[3:36:26] <Raggy_Potaby> this is for a sprint not a marathon
[3:36:26] <%SirGO0SE> just glide your finger back and forth over the button, keep it on the controller
[3:36:26] <%RetroCop87> I use my left index finger, then drum on it with my right fingers in a row
[3:36:27] <LVL1_Scumbag> That's why I just map turbo buttons
[3:36:27] <dukenux> it does
[3:36:27] <tubit> With great power...
[3:36:28] <jimmytwofeet> CHOKE-JERK FELLAS LETS GO
[3:36:29] <%Lunaticbro > shake weight
[3:36:30] <spryte333> here's how--its bad to do! nice.
[3:36:30] <%rekinom> Pat activates sweet surrender
[3:36:30] <+balouie> wow I had no clue
[3:36:31] <%dashmatt> But look at those guns
[3:36:31] <+MugenSandan> @patstaresat isn't Get Into Fighting Games Woolie's thing
[3:36:31] <bakkatohri> Only use it for wedding nights?
[3:36:31] <%wydamn> This is how I do it. Pat spitting facts
[3:36:31] <+Over_ninek> and that was sex ed with pat Stares At
[3:36:32] <%Jashter18> How dafuq you even do that
[3:36:32] <%AzureGale> Pat says mash responsibly
[3:36:33] <%coreyyotto> The ol' clit twist
[3:36:33] <BTR_NOODLE> parkinson style of mashing
[3:36:34] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> What the fuck
[3:36:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Is that your cast from lifespan technique?
[3:36:36] <heartlesshealer> Also be wary if your controller buttons suck and have tons of resistance
[3:36:37] <%WhereIsWill> so PATS BERSERKER MASH?!?!?!
[3:36:37] <GrimHeaper323> "I have to go all out, just this once." *mashes*
[3:36:37] <%SirGO0SE> that one is a lot easier on the hands but can cause blister
[3:36:37] <IminyourBase> this trick also works on the ladies
[3:36:38] <NitronStreams> you just tense your arm become vibrator man
[3:36:38] <SaltyAzteca> @PatStaresAt With great power comes a fucked up bicep
[3:36:39] <+Tonku_the_Red> I alternate with my index and middle finger. Less fatifue.
[3:36:39] <%Ranryu692> I put a finger underneath the controller to cut down on the rebound time
[3:36:39] <%averyoddjew> that's how i win all the time in mash wars against my friends
[3:36:39] <LVL1_Scumbag> Fuck mashing
[3:36:41] <KeiPrime> nice jerk technique
[3:36:42] <%Sol_Install> Dragon ball Z games for mashing and naruto told me to say FUCK IT
[3:36:42] <olaksi> REMOVING SMASHING LIMITERS
[3:36:42] <robotman37> THE LIFE OR DEATH TECH
[3:36:43] <thatangryguyofde> You know its optimized when it feels like you are dying
[3:36:45] <%TinyLittleDancer> is that not your brachioradialis muscle?
[3:36:45] <RyuuAoi> Pat, THIS WORKS
[3:36:46] <+b_aleph> real trick: use a controller with turbo function
[3:36:50] <Broken_Sonex> It's a power that can only used sparingly.
[3:36:53] <Vyneci> But since there are two buttons that shoot during Space Harrier, use your index and middle finger to alternate between them @PatStaresAt
[3:36:53] <TonberryLives> Mash Responsibly
[3:36:53] <shotgang86> you do it for only some REALLY SPECIFIC TIMES
[3:36:55] <%Monkeyweed21> I can lock my finger joints in a fucked up way so I use my index finger @PatStaresAt
[3:37:01] <+Over_ninek> Thanks Pat my wife has never been happier
[3:37:01] <+zeraux_> @PatStaresAt the skeleton ball shirt still for sale?
[3:37:06] <Laecerelius> It takes YEARS off of our life
[3:37:06] <%wydamn> @b_aleph BOO THIS MAN
[3:37:09] <KeiPrime> its not a story the jedi would tell you
[3:37:11] <ammobasket> tense bicep and tricep
[3:37:11] <+MrAtheGreat> DESTROY YOURSELF FOR POWER
[3:37:12] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Onto the finale
[3:37:13] <%Keyd00d> I HAVE NO OTHER OPTION
[3:37:13] <bleugh> i hate button mashing
[3:37:14] <paralars_> Pat, how do i activate witch time while mashing?
[3:37:14] <dukenux> DOKTOR, REMOVE MY MASH LIMITERS
[3:37:15] <+EyeFarted> LIKE ONE FOR ALL?
[3:37:16] <+Basker17> Remember kids, the only Hp that matters in the last one!
[3:37:17] <IminyourBase> literally all for one, your body isn't strong enough to handle it
[3:37:19] <Profmcstevie> The best trick is to map all the buttons on an arcade stick to the button and PRESS THEM ALL
[3:37:19] <shotgang86> unless you go to the gym and gets more resistance in your ARM
[3:37:22] <+Pyroclase> this is why every game needs the option to disable button mashing
[3:37:23] <%SirGO0SE> the slide isnt too bad but you can blister
[3:37:25] <user_naim> You mean a Fucking DEVIL TRIGGER?
[3:37:27] <+MrAtheGreat> Basically the dark wave from FF4
[3:37:27] <shotgang86> your mash can only get so good
[3:37:32] <%Plesin> time for daddies
[3:37:32] <%Monkeyweed21> Its still the same method with any finger
[3:37:32] <%baka_sugoi> secret technique
[3:37:33] <fuji_92> let me go all out master, just this once @patstaresat
[3:37:36] <heartlesshealer> mashing and endless, quick rotations destroy the arm
[3:37:36] <DrStinkers> The forbidden mashing technique takes 1 year off your lifespan
[3:37:36] <%Emperor_Machinus> I lock up my whole arm and cause my right side to vibrate. just have to know at what depth the button on the controller accept the input
[3:37:39] <+b_aleph> @wydamn why are you booing me? Im right!
[3:37:39] <laserbeaming> is it time for Gracious and Glorious?
[3:37:40] <BleedinActionMan> This should do that thing MGS does where it gives you an arm massage after the mashing sequence
[3:37:41] <%WhereIsWill> berserker orb mash finale is too powerful
[3:37:44] <TerrifyingRei_05> What the fuck even is this city?
[3:37:48] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> I'll just do it normally, I think.
[3:37:52] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> she's so smol
[3:37:55] <%wydamn> @b_aleph oh no
[3:37:55] <+Tonku_the_Red> Just alternate with your index and middle finger, like a drumroll. Way easier.
[3:37:56] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @PatStaresAt How many years would you estimate your forbidden mashing technique has taken off your lifespan?
[3:37:57] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:37:59] <+TungstenViper> Y E S
[3:37:59] <bleugh> the metal gear rising stick waggle is the worst, feels like i'm breaking the controller
[3:38:01] <Vork88> i hope you use the kermit mod pat
[3:38:01] <%Ranryu692> "gets"
[3:38:03] <+Cobaltor_252> it's anime af
[3:38:03] <shotgang86> wait until you get to bayo 2
[3:38:04] <SlippedDisco> awful LUL
[3:38:05] <%SirGO0SE> oh also the sliding mash might work worse on controllers with buttons that dont have rounded edges
[3:38:08] <%arancet> the 2nd ones possibly dumber, but its great
[3:38:08] <+fetrigon> oh boy
[3:38:10] <dukenux> no vey Kappa
[3:38:11] <FrostyKaze> With great power comes great responsibility
[3:38:12] <%CalderGaming> it needs bayo 2's plot to be even remotely tolerable
[3:38:16] <%baka_sugoi> GOD???
[3:38:16] <umbraawitch> love listening to balder's lecture for 20 minutes
[3:38:19] <shotgang86> in bayo 2 it gets boderline silly
[3:38:23] <Udongein_1> RIIIISE
[3:38:25] <dukenux> What was that zoom LUL
[3:38:27] <RyuuAoi> I believe yiu first taught us thus in RE4. Rewatch the ENTIRE RE4 LP to find out.
[3:38:27] <%AzureGale> Is the disembodied voice talking about their penis
[3:38:28] <i_am_therydon> how could you possibly forget how stupid this is?
[3:38:30] <Broken_Sonex> MMMMMM MEEEEEEEE
[3:38:31] <%Tearonex> the deepest plo
[3:38:34] <+Tearonex> plot
[3:38:39] <Udongein_1> wot?
[3:38:39] <dukenux> Eeeeeeexcellent my child
[3:38:40] <Profmcstevie> All I remember of Bayo 2 is a fucking mountain
[3:38:42] <SlippedDisco> daddy?
[3:38:43] <+TungstenViper> Cereza be like Pepega
[3:38:46] <RyuuAoi> The FINAL BATTLE though
[3:38:47] <M0untain_wolf> MUMMY!
[3:38:51] <dukenux> monkaS
[3:38:52] <%TalisKanju> I think the missile toss sucks
[3:38:53] <laserbeaming> it's so stupid
[3:38:54] <justachap> Dattay
[3:39:01] <LVL1_Scumbag> That kid needs a leash
[3:39:01] <%whyskeywolfe> LOKI.
[3:39:02] <%AzureGale> LITTLE ONE
[3:39:02] <bleugh> does bayo think this kid has her name by coincidence?
[3:39:03] <+Greywyn00> I remeber a cool plant demon
[3:39:03] <Laecerelius> I remember that dumb rat child
[3:39:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I remember a lot of fuckin' dope demons
[3:39:06] <%Agami23> i remember santa
[3:39:06] <SomersaultJustice> even though both plots are bad, I think bayo 1's plot was kinda more interesting
[3:39:07] <+fetrigon> @profmcstevie true LUL
[3:39:08] <%CalderGaming> I remember THIEF OF PROGRESS
[3:39:11] <%AzureGale> GIRL
[3:39:14] <ancrest_tant> It gets pretty dumb if I remember
[3:39:15] <%Keyd00d> I remember it having color
[3:39:18] <TerrifyingRei_05> How does this city function?
[3:39:26] <Jane_Lo> @bleugh amnesia, remember?
[3:39:28] <+Pyroclase> Pat, don't ause the art
[3:39:29] <heartlesshealer> it's almost time for Gracious and Glorius
[3:39:31] <+lucaflowe> Bayo 2 had a better plot even if it was still bad
[3:39:37] <heartlesshealer> Glorious*?
[3:39:40] <RyuuAoi> Bayo 2 = Heaven & Hell
[3:39:44] <NitronStreams> The Lumen Sage in Bayo2 Is cool
[3:39:47] <paralars_> the only thing i cared for in bayo 2 story was the part where you go and rescue jeanne
[3:40:00] <bleugh> @Jane_Lo yeah but she seemed to remeber it in the flashback just now, with jeanne
[3:40:11] <%Lion_kun> Pat trying to beat the game looks like
[3:40:15] <SlippedDisco> @paralars_ oh yeah, the alraune fight is so fun
[3:40:32] <Vork88> donations must be off
[3:40:35] <%wydamn> I could be wrong, but isn't the twist about how Bayo's dad is actually talking directly to Cereza, but Bayo just is able to hear it as well?
[3:40:43] <Jane_Lo> @bleugh not really, if we take in consideration next cutscene
[3:41:04] <rytisone> after temperantia
[3:41:08] <+trekkie11041> trekkie11041 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 7 months! here hoping that 2021 goes better
[3:41:41] <+MrAtheGreat> Hey pat have you tried the afterburnder mission in the Fox Costume?
[3:41:45] <Jane_Lo> @bleugh so basically - you'll see
[3:41:49] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @wydamn Nah, cuz he refers to "the child" as "the key to your future" so he's largely talking to Bayo
[3:41:55] <paralars_> Its the final fortitudo encounter in the game
[3:42:00] <laserbeaming> Gracious and Glorious time
[3:42:03] <BleedinActionMan> @MrAtheGreat That's in 2
[3:42:05] <mister_z_1994> @MrAtheGreat I think that only works in 2
[3:42:20] <heartlesshealer> YES THEY ARE
[3:42:22] <+MrAtheGreat> really? Damn that sucks.
[3:42:24] <Vork88> i think streamlabs is not working for pat
[3:42:29] <bettysharkface> Wait so is the little girl Bayo's...mother?
[3:42:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Yep
[3:42:34] <Jane_Lo> yeah, bayo1 doesn't have starfox costume
[3:42:36] <bettysharkface> I'm so confused
[3:42:41] <jimmytwofeet> ISS DA BOIS
[3:42:43] <umbraawitch> @bettysharkface you'll find out
[3:42:52] <Vork88> i donated but nothing pop up
[3:42:56] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Clank

[3:43:00] <+Over_ninek> hi Paige?
[3:43:02] <paralars_> you'll find out, maybe
[3:43:02] <%arcielardor> missed the aelfhein
[3:43:04] <heartlesshealer> I meant yes at gracious and glorious, I wasn't paying attention to whatever else was being talked about
[3:43:05] <%wydamn> @a_cd_by_thomas, ah, you're right, I do remember that line too. It doesn't exactly rule out that he was trying to talk to cereza, but it does mean he acknowledges that Bayo can also hear.
[3:43:06] <Laecerelius> Awww they're baybees!
[3:43:22] <mr22apples> Pat donations are off again
[3:43:32] <%WhereIsWill> that damage is outrageous
[3:44:24] <laserbeaming> best bois
[3:44:37] <+Pyroclase> maybe Twitch is just broken
[3:44:40] <+Pyroclase> (still)
[3:45:02] <%tinyswampthing> did twitch die agaiin
[3:45:10] <%Sweetangy021> twitch being twitch
[3:45:10] <+CptBritches> Dem fingers
[3:45:12] <%Plesin> twitch is a fuck
[3:45:13] <mr22apples> Twitch borked
[3:45:17] <+MrAtheGreat> is this maybe a case with obs?
[3:45:21] <%WhereIsWill> twitch has had a rough go today LUL
[3:45:22] <bettysharkface> Wiggly boys
[3:45:23] <%Ynkubus_> Twitch also still broken
[3:45:27] <bakkatohri> You can collect rings and transform into a bunch of different animals, but you can't transform into a hedgehog?
[3:45:31] <%DashXero> Didn't twitch have a site-wide problem on New Years'?
[3:45:35] <SlippedDisco> joy PogChamp
[3:45:40] <+Greywyn00> How did Luka get through all these armed guards
[3:45:43] <RyuuAoi> Hate this bitches
[3:46:06] <RyuuAoi> @greywyn00 He's a sneak
[3:46:21] <+MrAtheGreat> Yep, I think twitch dmca'd the new years stream which caused it to end like 30 mins in or someting
[3:46:31] <RyuuAoi> @greywyn00 Basically the Solid Snake of this universe.
[3:46:33] <Jane_Lo> @bakkatohri you kind of can, in samus suit
[3:46:42] <+Greywyn00> LUL
[3:47:36] <umbraawitch> bayo was supposed to have a ulala costume but sega said no :/
[3:47:43] <anuchallengertwitch> Hey joke question, since this game opens at Eggman's grave, does that mean that bayonetta is an alternate continuity of Sonc?
[3:47:52] <+RenoDeGeneric> Daaamn Temperance what that neck do?
[3:48:08] <PrinceOfEden> @RenoDeGeneric Whatever it needs to.
[3:48:12] <PrinceOfEden> KappaRoss
[3:48:15] <RyuuAoi> He's was only for scale
[3:48:49] <+Greywyn00> did you know Iron Maidens had spikes specifically for piercing the eyes and ears? :)
[3:49:03] <BoxNavy> :) no i didnt
[3:49:09] <%doomunderthestairs> birches love cannons
[3:49:12] <anuchallengertwitch> I swear that Temperance says "Come on!"
[3:49:12] <PrinceOfEden> I did know that actually.
[3:49:16] <%doomunderthestairs> birches*
[3:49:17] <%AzureGale> How many times to we have to teach you a lesson, old man?
[3:49:21] <%BoxNavy> this does sucks
[3:49:21] <%doomunderthestairs> bitches
[3:49:24] <%Emperor_Machinus> So human weapon can defeat angels if needed
[3:49:25] <laserbeaming> Temperance, the most boring of Virtues
[3:49:26] <+FingaLights> 👏 Turrets
[3:49:28] <%BoxNavy> yeah
[3:49:28] <RyuuAoi> Getting down the the nitty gritty
[3:49:34] <pilllowofbees> Worst part of the game right here
[3:49:38] <%DashXero> But then it wouldn't be Bayonetta... Would it?
[3:49:41] <%tinyswampthing> the bike one sucks the least
[3:49:41] <%baka_sugoi> i mean they tried
[3:49:41] <%averyoddjew> this is the worst one
[3:49:43] <Raggy_Potaby> just make an action game please BibleThump
[3:49:45] <+BettyMwwaahh> its the 360 era. there HAS to be a turret section
[3:49:46] <+CptBritches> I do like them trying to add variety but they didn't do it well enough each time
[3:49:49] <+Over_ninek> this is my most hated section
[3:49:49] <RyuuAoi> They got that arcade flava, Pat. It's SEGA.
[3:49:52] <laserbeaming> pretty much
[3:49:53] <%LaughingCatt> Kinda just wish they would stick with their awesome action combat
[3:50:00] <%Ynkubus_> Kamiya says "fuck you, gamer test now"
[3:50:02] <jimmytwofeet> chug chug chug chug chug
[3:50:04] <+Partialrecall2> i cant think of a single game where i was like "oh yeah long travel time projectile turret, so fun!"
[3:50:13] <%Dementedpenguin> The problem with these minigames is that they get in the way of the main gameplay, which is better.
[3:50:14] <%NopeBadguy> turret section like we're back in 2008
[3:50:14] <%Lunaticbro > space harrier would have been cool if it didn't block a boss fight
[3:50:17] <%SirGO0SE> just schuut gooder
[3:50:21] <PrinceOfEden> F
[3:50:22] <%Dementedpenguin> MUCH better
[3:50:23] <+Kaiserzelcor> LUL
[3:50:27] <%BoxNavy> :)
[3:50:27] <%AzureGale> ded
[3:50:27] <ammobasket> Did you know that the Iron Maiden was created as a hoax torture device?
[3:50:29] <DrkJP520> lmao
[3:50:29] <cherrycottontail> just use an item 4head
[3:50:31] <%baka_sugoi> gut guud
[3:50:31] <+Greywyn00> LUL
[3:50:32] <%BoxNavy> yeah you love it
[3:50:32] <+TungstenViper> such well designed feature
[3:50:36] <%averyoddjew> bayo 1 is rough
[3:50:37] <%BoxNavy> jesus zangief
[3:50:38] <KilljoyHexx> "True test of my skills out here" Dies
[3:50:40] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:50:42] <%WhereIsWill> LUL
[3:50:45] <godzookylives> at least Bayo 2 doesn't have anywhere near this amount of extra bullshit
[3:51:04] <Profmcstevie> I'll have you know turret sections are the hallmark of all the best designers, which is why Animal Crossing is a weak franchise Kappa
[3:51:05] <KeiPrime> RUB SCREEN
[3:51:10] <GrimHeaper323> parts like this is why i dont want to replay this game
[3:51:10] <%BoxNavy> Jebaited
[3:51:12] <+CarissMcbober> Remember when Dead Space had a weird out of place turret section too? Those were the days.
[3:51:12] <%Keyd00d> GET DOWN
[3:51:14] <%DashXero> Get down off the turret.
[3:51:16] <PrinceOfEden> IT GETS YOU OFF THE TURRET, DOESN'T IT?!
[3:51:18] <+Rewrench> get down up
[3:51:22] <justachap> Remember my brother getting REAL angry at this part
[3:51:24] <olaksi> That's like the opposite!
[3:51:24] <TheBadonkulator> you're supposed to get jiggy with it
[3:51:24] <%baka_sugoi> brok
[3:51:24] <NitronStreams> GEDDAN
[3:51:25] <+Greywyn00> I'm Kamiya and I put in multiple turret sections in Bayo 3 just for you Pat :)
[3:51:30] <KeiPrime> getting down
[3:51:31] <%TalisKanju> The Space Harrier part would have been fine if it was a third as long
[3:51:31] <%Keyd00d> get down on it
[3:51:31] <%Lunaticbro > glass him
[3:51:32] <+CptBritches> You gotta get up to get down
[3:51:32] <marvel877> Get down off the turret
[3:51:33] <KeiPrime> with your bad self
[3:51:34] <%Emperor_Machinus> It's get down with your funky self
[3:51:34] <+Tonku_the_Red> Get DOWNS!
[3:51:34] <A_CD_By_Thomas> You jump up, jump up to get down
[3:51:35] <%YakumoYomi> Gotta get up to get down
[3:51:36] <+MrAtheGreat> tbf countering the Jeanne missile counts as "Evade" in this game so....
[3:51:38] <%AzureGale> Should have been "Get Off"... wait...
[3:51:41] <Idon__> KAMIYAAAAAA
[3:51:52] <%the22cstomp> pat doesnt understand it means get down off the turret cause he cant go any lower than he is
[3:51:59] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> NUMBER 1
[3:52:02] <%Deano8817> damn I really have no fucking memory of this part
[3:52:13] <%Emperor_Machinus> cat scene damage
[3:52:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> I sees it
[3:52:22] <jimmytwofeet> chug chug chug chug chug
[3:52:23] <kitsune23star> you can witch time the bullets
[3:52:27] <marvel877> Yeah, you dodged right into the fist, Pat.
[3:52:29] <+MrAtheGreat> thats cause you needed to royal guard it its the olnly way
[3:52:30] <Raggy_Potaby> what's worse, this or Saviour?
[3:52:31] <%AyotoCorp> This hurts my eyes
[3:52:31] <KeiPrime> you think this part is better than the space harrier part?
[3:52:34] <%bigsteviecool90> This section is for sure my least favorite part of the game
[3:52:34] <%Keyd00d> At least there's more interactivity than that FFXV dlc turret boss where you just hold a button down and wait
[3:52:34] <+MrAtheGreat> It doesn't.
[3:52:34] <%the22cstomp> cause it didnt
[3:52:39] <GrimHeaper323> Bayo 2 didnt have something this bad
[3:52:41] <+balouie> it didnt
[3:52:41] <%averyoddjew> bayo 2 is a much better game
[3:52:44] <BleedinActionMan> You did
[3:52:46] <paralars_> so, how many temperantias do those guys have in stock, anyway?
[3:52:47] <%Keyd00d> You do
[3:52:47] <%charp35> Bayo 2 has way less
[3:52:49] <umbraawitch> in bayo 2 you spend more time panic dodging
[3:52:55] <+MrAtheGreat> Bayo 2's version of THIS was the robo-bayo
[3:52:57] <GrimHeaper323> Bayo 2 just had the horse and the shmup
[3:52:58] <%AzureGale> "Fucking fighting" is a good way to describe Bayonetta :x
[3:52:59] <+Rewrench> in boya 2 you spent time following the dumb kid
[3:53:04] <+fetrigon> LUL
[3:53:07] <%BoxNavy> 3 didnt age :)
[3:53:09] <%coreyyotto> What about Bayo 1 compared to DMC4?
[3:53:14] <bleugh> it sure did
[3:53:16] <umbraawitch> you also spend time fighting sloth
[3:53:18] <%Ranryu692> hell yeah it did
[3:53:18] <medril07> long ass part of the game
[3:53:19] <%Keyd00d> no
[3:53:19] <%trekkie11041> DMC3 didnt have turrent sections
[3:53:21] <BleedinActionMan> @MrAtheGreat The Robo Bayo?
[3:53:21] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Oh damn
[3:53:21] <dukenux> PS3 era gimmicks baybeee
[3:53:21] <%LaughingCatt> I wonder why lobosKek
[3:53:23] <%DashXero> All the way at the bottom?
[3:53:24] <bakkatohri> Devil May Cry 3 was okay, but the game that aged the absolute best was the first game.
[3:53:25] <rytisone> up your butt?
[3:53:25] <stardustcrusad3r> how did 3 age? the shitty shield enemies?
[3:53:27] <medril07> at the bottom?
[3:53:27] <GrimHeaper323> at the bottom?
[3:53:28] <%Keyd00d> at the beginning of the level
[3:53:29] <+MrAtheGreat> Was it inside us the entire time?
[3:53:29] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Like milk.
[3:53:30] <+CptBritches> Is it in the secret realm?
[3:53:32] <i_am_therydon> the bottom?
[3:53:32] <GrimHeaper323> please dont be the bottom
[3:53:33] <%BoxNavy> moon2W
[3:53:34] <%charp35> Start of the level?
[3:53:34] <Sunstalker> Bad backtracking is bad
[3:53:35] <%weissguard> Down, down, down, to the bottom of the sea
[3:53:41] <Profmcstevie> DMC4 came out before this dude, Itsuno was way ahead already
[3:53:42] <%Dementedpenguin> Bayonetta 1's gameplay is fun, but there's a LOT of BS in there as well.
[3:53:42] <Idon__> Kamiya "It made sense to the devs as they were playing the game."
[3:53:46] <GrimHeaper323> oh my lord, we're actually going all the way down
[3:53:46] <%walternatorz> eh
[3:53:46] <PrinceOfEden> I honestly don't remember, but I have an idea.
[3:53:46] <+MrAtheGreat> @BleedinActionMan THe Bayo suit or whatever you call ity
[3:53:47] <%BoxNavy> its a secret
[3:53:50] <%Keyd00d> I remember this
[3:53:50] <medril07> this is redic
[3:53:54] <GrimHeaper323> lytNOTIKETHIS
[3:53:54] <NitronStreams> More backtracking than a metroidvania
[3:53:56] <+CptBritches> Gotta work to get those secret missions
[3:53:58] <olaksi> now this is real vidya games
[3:54:00] <GrimHeaper323> B R U H
[3:54:00] <Idon__> WHY
[3:54:03] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Wow
[3:54:04] <i_am_therydon> called it
[3:54:04] <Manipulator98> would yo consider streaming revengeance or phantom pain?
[3:54:06] <+MrAtheGreat> I'm dying of allergies so forgive me for sounding crazy
[3:54:09] <%DashXero> Started at the bottom. Now we're... Back at the bottom...
[3:54:09] <heartlesshealer> =)
[3:54:10] <%BoxNavy> kamiya should only be allowed to make cool fights and nothign else
[3:54:10] <BleedinActionMan> @MrAtheGreat Oh, the Umbran Arnor!
[3:54:18] <jimmytwofeet> that is, how you say, LE BULLSHITT
[3:54:19] <ygtidal> wtf
[3:54:19] <%Ynkubus_> It was funny joke
[3:54:20] <BleedinActionMan> Armor*
[3:54:22] <%Keyd00d> that's a kamiya
[3:54:24] <+MrAtheGreat> @BleedinActionMan eiiiiii That was it!
[3:54:29] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @stardustcrusad3r It's aged... okay. I'm playing for the first time now and it's fine. V spoiled me for it though.
[3:54:33] <+Greywyn00> SourPls
[3:54:36] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Witch time disabled on fire angels, fuck y'all
[3:54:48] <%Lunaticbro > good place for a "SECRET" mission

[3:58:41] <+twohitgood> beige
[3:58:41] <PrinceOfEden> HEY
[3:58:44] <%DashXero> That sounds about right.
[3:58:45] <PrinceOfEden> There's some gold
[3:58:45] <%Plesin> pat isn't that just
[3:58:46] <+fetrigon> true LUL
[3:58:46] <KeiPrime> yeah fly me to the moon cause o fhte eva connection but fucking moon river is a heck of a banger
[3:58:46] <%Plesin> silver
[3:58:48] <+TungstenViper> Black and Gold
[3:58:49] <Slicerv> was the dmc reboot about the same but it was black and red?
[3:58:49] <%Ranryu692> don't forget metallic white
[3:58:52] <+twohitgood> everything is beige
[3:58:52] <Slicerv> wasn't*
[3:58:54] <bakkatohri> I hate golden color schemes.
[3:58:55] <otakon17> Is this...a nod to Okami? The whole "Running while making flowers pop up"?
[3:58:58] <%AzureGale> There's also concrete
[3:59:01] <+Tonku_the_Red> That's 7th gen for ya.
[3:59:02] <mike2hands> and dirty stoney white
[3:59:02] <Profmcstevie> The first thing I noticed when I played Bayo 2 soon after 1? I just liked staring at the first levels water
[3:59:08] <A_CD_By_Thomas> @otakon17 Probably
[3:59:08] <TonberryLives> PS3 360 gen
[3:59:09] <BleedinActionMan> @otakon17 indeed it is
[3:59:09] <%LaughingCatt> Hey kids, heard you like filters slapped on literally everything
[3:59:10] <+BettyMwwaahh> Angels are boring bitches
[3:59:11] <bakkatohri> Gold is honestly such a boring color
[3:59:11] <+gitgouda> this form is cool
[3:59:12] <OkamiDude15> @otakon17 yes
[3:59:13] <%Kitafin> gotta shine
[3:59:14] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> in theory it makes bayo stand out more with sharp blacks and reds, but the color grading applies to her too :|
[3:59:15] <+fetrigon> @otakon17 ye
[3:59:16] <+TungstenViper> It's the color of Night Time New York. It's Classy jazz
[3:59:18] <Manipulator98> V does kinda
[3:59:21] <Raggy_Potaby> at least V kinda got it
[3:59:22] <%Agami23> his version should have been the bike
[3:59:25] <+CookieCutter007> just guard fly
[3:59:25] <umbraawitch> xbox ps3 era loved piss filters
[3:59:25] <%averyoddjew> dante should just turn into a pizza delivery truck
[3:59:25] <%SirGO0SE> i guess V is the only one that comes close
[3:59:27] <%coffeebearCafe> it's muddy looking like a lot of games from this gen imo
[3:59:27] <+Over_ninek> incredibly bizarre he cant just ride the motorcycle around
[3:59:27] <corepercentlives> each game had to choose 3 colors - that was the rule
[3:59:33] <NeroIscariot12> No DMC level has levels/missions this long tho
[3:59:36] <%superc37> @otakon17 no clearly its a nod to metal gear /s
[3:59:44] <%Ranryu692> because shut up, that's why
[3:59:45] <Idon__> Man, now I wish Vergil turned into Shadow
[3:59:57] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Why u got so many elevators to throw at me

[4:00:04] <Profmcstevie> Movement should be appropriate for environment, Dante never runs this much
[4:00:09] <+Tonku_the_Red> Then Bayo 2's final boss is bright blue. . .
[4:00:15] <PrinceOfEden> @NeroIscariot12 The layout is also nowhere near as wild.
[4:00:25] <olaksi> why can't you dodge that pat?
[4:00:27] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> I gotta say, this Creator fellow has terrible taste
[4:00:27] <%SirGO0SE> @Profmcstevie true. and the need to backtrack isnt as heavy
[4:00:28] <%Emperor_Machinus> @Tonku_the_Red You space dorito
[4:00:29] <user_naim> I love the sound design on these freaks
[4:00:29] <%LaughingCatt> Also, not a fan of the forced repeat boss rushes that always make their way into these games
[4:00:33] <DraxTD> is a happy baby face for pat
[4:00:36] <+AutechreTwinAphex> this Zanarkand now?
[4:00:38] <Idon__> At least let Dante ride Cavaliere around for funsies.
[4:00:49] <artoflec> hell no give me boss rushes always i want to step it up to them
[4:00:53] <PrinceOfEden> Like, the most open DMC gets is for boss rooms and the occasional big encounter. Bayo's stages are hella dependent on movement.
[4:00:53] <ostrich4_> odd looking bloke that one
[4:01:41] <%BoxNavy> ball it up
[4:01:41] <+Greywyn00> !!PAT AT RISK!!
[4:01:44] <%WhereIsWill> get ya head in the game!
[4:01:47] <heartlesshealer> Fantasy Zone has destroyed the Pat
[4:01:53] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Slice
[4:02:02] <%Emperor_Machinus> FAntasy zone took it out of Pat
[4:02:09] <Idon__> Damn, she just karate chopped it
[4:02:14] <sirkingofbooty> Is this near the end of the game?
[4:02:15] <olwe123> Come on Pat just use a item...
[4:02:16] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> Pat's arm is presently exploding.
[4:02:20] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Welcome to BALL'D UP
[4:02:23] <wembleyttv> I forgot how messed up looking this boss is
[4:02:27] <Profmcstevie> Them satans gonna GETCHA pat
[4:02:37] <%AzureGale> Is that a weeping angel
[4:02:38] <rytisone> The Savior is coming
[4:02:38] <NitronStreams> Hey look its "The Savior" Kappa
[4:02:38] <NeroIscariot12> Oh look its Saviour 2.0 LUL
[4:02:39] <%trekkie11041> THE SAVIOR IS COMING
[4:02:39] <@SSaryn> Using items? What's wrong with you
[4:02:46] <@SSaryn> No items will be used here.
[4:02:48] <%LaughingCatt> Now your in heaven... somehow
[4:02:48] <user_naim> Oh it’s DMC4
[4:02:51] <user_naim> great
[4:02:56] <olwe123> lmao
[4:03:06] <skeletonkingofmanlets> i AM 100% sure that the changes to Bayo2 combat design was due to the joy cons. Any other action game is unplayable unless you are using a pro controller
[4:03:07] <Raggy_Potaby> the saviour is coming!
[4:03:11] <%DakotaMacDoodle> DMC4 and Bayo one really like giant god-like statues
[4:03:12] <%Kitafin> Sanctus
[4:03:16] <+Chester_goes_Berserk> Kamiya only played a little of dmc4 for research on this game
[4:03:21] <NeroIscariot12> Same writer. Bingo Morihashi
[4:03:23] <%rekinom> "Let's kill god"
[4:03:24] <%LaughingCatt> Didnt Platinum say DMC4 was a big inspiration for Bayo?
[4:03:29] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Aight
[4:03:29] <%AzureGale> Banana bread
[4:03:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> PISS
[4:03:32] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> they clearly kept going to the same places for luncj
[4:03:33] <TheBadonkulator> they probably met at a barbecue every once in a while
[4:03:33] <wembleyttv> Well its platinum games I let them off
[4:03:33] <+TungstenViper> similar influences
[4:03:36] <NitronStreams> Probably left over Ideas from older DMCs
[4:03:41] <bakkatohri> Pat's prostate must be weakening
[4:03:42] <afronooch> P I S S
[4:03:43] <bakkatohri> Now is our chance
[4:03:44] <%YakumoYomi> I could go for some banana bread
[4:03:51] <%weissguard> @skeletonkingofmanlets Bayo 2 was originally a Wii U game, but go off.
[4:03:56] <%DiscoMatador> Yo ya'll seen that new 6 HOUR Tim Rogers Video? shits tight
[4:04:01] <Raggy_Potaby> that crazy talk animation is amazing
[4:04:13] <CloniiCory> In fairness Bayo and DMC are cousins. Overlap is inevitable.
[4:04:20] <umbraawitch> @weissguard the wii u gamepad was awful for bayo 2
[4:04:30] <%weissguard> @umbraawitch
[4:04:33] <%weissguard> And?
[4:04:58] <umbraawitch> ......and?
[4:05:15] <ape_hawk> did pat shit himself again?
[4:05:17] <connerhozer> I am literally trapped in the flame run section up ahead in Bayonetta
[4:05:37] <%weissguard> And, how is that relevant, @umbraawitch
[4:05:43] <%captain_thickthighs> we're defending the Wii u now what's next going to be defending najhing?
[4:05:46] <%YakumoYomi> That was quick
[4:05:53] <ape_hawk> thats not a pillow, thats elmo!!!
[4:05:54] <skeletonkingofmanlets> I was just now playing bayo1 on joy cons on portable mode and it makes no sense ergonomically. same thing with DMC3
[4:06:11] <user_naim> I need to replay this. Bad bits and all
[4:06:17] <%Daniel_Is_I> Just don't get hit
[4:06:21] <%WhereIsWill> clutch it out old man
[4:06:34] <wembleyttv> I played Bayo 1 on steam after rising I can not for the life of me play bayo well at all
[4:06:54] <%SaiyanShoto> Pats beach ball ass is is smashing the pillows
[4:06:58] <%captain_thickthighs> Ive never touched this game I know it's good but I can wait for a remaster
[4:07:05] <wembleyttv> Still loved it all the same
[4:07:22] <%Daniel_Is_I> Timed jumping puzzles? This IS DMC4
[4:07:24] <BleedinActionMan> @captain_thickthighs this IS the remaster
[4:07:42] <+TungstenViper> @captain_thickthighs this is teh remaster
[4:08:00] <Manipulator98> makes me appreciate how dmc5 is just combat

[4:08:38] <%LaughingCatt> Just gotta hit the floor lobosEZ
[4:08:41] <Profmcstevie> .....were you expecting fall damage?
[4:08:43] <%ZephynM> The hero pixel PogChamp
[4:08:44] <dukenux> Your punishment must be more severe...
[4:08:47] <%AEUG_Ace_Kamille> @Manipulator98 Oh yeah, that game is so much better for it I feel.
[4:08:49] <connerhozer> Yeah DMC doing all combat was so appreciated, even getting rid of doors
[4:08:57] <@SSaryn> Nice.

[4:09:15] <+TungstenViper> LE big save
[4:09:22] <jimmytwofeet> noice LUL
[4:09:31] <Valentinius_Anodyne> That could've been worse

[4:11:56] <CloniiCory> @Manipulator98 First thing that came to mind.
[4:11:57] <%captain_thickthighs> eh ignore me The best I played in terms of a remaster was the moguri mod for ff9
[4:12:03] <%Agami23> a what?
[4:12:03] <%shurtal> it's all Evangelion
[4:12:03] <%Daniel_Is_I> A what?
[4:12:05] <+TungstenViper> @umbraawitch there will be no Bayo1 remaster
[4:12:09] <%SGrim> Huh. maybe it's an angel?
[4:12:10] <+MrAtheGreat> Nintendo needs it's own set of Blue-Points to remake all the games they refuse toi
[4:12:12] <dukenux> ???
[4:12:13] <%Calliphor> Looks like a Rez boss
[4:12:14] <+Walopoh> always has been
[4:12:15] <heartlesshealer> hmm
[4:12:17] <$spardanwarrior> Really got Eva on your mind huh Pat
[4:12:19] <%Agami23> pat you have had evangellion on the brain lately
[4:12:24] <KeiPrime> i can see that
[4:12:26] <%radda343> I assumed that was the intention
[4:12:29] <umbraawitch> @TungstenViper never said they would, i'd rather have bayo 3
[4:12:29] <%Keyd00d> We were all busy playing FFXV from the week before LG came out. Then that game made us too depressed to play more vidya
[4:12:29] <%Ynkubus_> Its an Angeruu~
[4:12:32] <%Agami23> that movie has your brain GOIN'
[4:12:34] <i_am_therydon> pat you ever play the old jedi knight and jedi academy games?

[4:12:55] <%captain_thickthighs> I love evangelion but the series needs to die like dragon Ball z
[4:12:55] <%Deft_Thought> Excited for another disappointing movie hell yeah
[4:12:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> Pat after your tweets about Evangelion, you're not allowed to make fun of Fate ever again LUL
[4:13:04] <%shurtal> It all keeps tumbling down, Pat
[4:13:04] <KeiPrime> lately for the past... 20 odd years
[4:13:06] <+Walopoh> Pat is an S2 engine LUL

[4:13:23] <%LaughingCatt> GET EM
[4:13:24] <+TungstenViper> Nintendo prefers to make new games. if they make remasters they will eventually be like this one
[4:13:27] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Damn
[4:13:30] <%Ranryu692> again lol
[4:13:30] <%BoxNavy> same

[4:13:41] <+MrAtheGreat> wait I only did that once god damnit
[4:13:41] <+CptBritches> Gotta use those good bits
[4:13:41] <%Deft_Thought> Why are you surprised? They reuse bits all the time.
[4:13:44] <PortableBoredom> Show's what you know, I'm laughin'
[4:13:45] <+thesw1tch> they arent wasting all that work
[4:13:46] <KeiPrime> u missed....
[4:13:52] <+Greywyn00> gotta USE THEM ASSETS
[4:13:53] <%NopeBadguy> Someone was really proud of that bit
[4:13:54] <%Keyd00d> It didn't hit the first time, it fumbled the ball
[4:13:54] <%the22cstomp> budget pat
[4:13:58] <%king_wragles> Did Pat get the pearl?
[4:13:58] <+MrAtheGreat> I thought* they only did that once
[4:14:00] <+mr_dream__> Attack and Dethrone God
[4:14:00] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I still dig it
[4:14:00] <%Ranryu692> what, they were gonna spend the money to make a new animation?
[4:14:05] <heartlesshealer> made of arms, dextrous as a sledgehammer
[4:14:07] <+CptBritches> D:
[4:14:10] <CloniiCory> @TungstenViper At this point I'd just take them porting all the Zelda HD's to the switch.
[4:14:14] <NitronStreams> I've notice a couple times that japanese humor will just repeat the same gags with no change every once in a while
[4:14:19] <zebult> wow I love mario oddessy
[4:14:44] <%captain_thickthighs> Bayonetta 3, God's dick flattening
[4:14:45] <+TungstenViper> @CloniiCory that's fair, maybe even adapting Skyward sword to the switch
[4:14:51] <dinnydanny777> He has a fairly small health bar
[4:14:59] <olaksi> the seemed a bit anticlimactic
[4:15:03] <connerhozer> I am literally stuck at the flame run after this mini-boss, it’s the worst
[4:15:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Fuckin' rip
[4:15:04] <%dashmatt> das a good combo
[4:15:05] <+fetrigon> ok...
[4:15:07] <%Agami23> he got phantomed

[4:15:24] <+goddamndavid> damn that is some sonic ass shit
[4:15:28] <+fetrigon> alright then
[4:15:30] <%Deft_Thought> Was that a Witch Heart piece?
[4:15:31] <heartlesshealer> yay platinum
[4:15:55] <PortableBoredom> It's a shame Bayonetta will never be in a Smash game after this one, especially considering she's awful in Ultimate
[4:15:56] <Hellarussian> this game is dank
[4:15:58] <%WhereIsWill> oooh cool
[4:16:00] <megasammitch> @PatStaresAt are you looking forward to GDQ tomorrow?
[4:16:04] <%Deft_Thought> UH OH, HOENHIEM
[4:16:05] <+Greywyn00> must be a coincidence :)
[4:16:06] <dinnydanny777> It kinda looks like Midgar
[4:16:07] <rasamune> That's weird! It's probably nothing
[4:16:08] <Raggy_Potaby> urban planning at it's finest
[4:16:08] <+TungstenViper> maybe
[4:16:09] <%LaughingCatt> I'm sure thats not important at all

[4:19:34] <%Deft_Thought> 3rd act villain reveals always suck
[4:19:35] <mister_z_1994> @Mattapawd There's flashback levels in 2
[4:19:35] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Doesn't Sparda have one?
[4:19:37] <dinnydanny777> It's a Chekhov's eye
[4:19:38] <%weissguard> At least Balder's fight is fun
[4:19:40] <+TungstenViper> @dukenux because he's basically Sparda
[4:19:41] <%SirGO0SE> z

[4:19:54] <PanicSwytch> Bay 2 is technically a prequel
[4:19:56] <%AzureGale> Is his speaking style supposed to be like G-Man
[4:19:56] <ammobasket> He needs a better Left Eye
[4:19:57] <%Plesin> oh yeah in 2 you do some fuuuucked shit if this is anything to go by

[4:21:05] <%baka_sugoi> Por ke?
[4:21:09] <mister_z_1994> @Hellarussian Balder must have gotten his acting chops from the Betflix Transformers series
[4:21:09] <dukenux> "Quid pro quo, Bayonetta"
[4:21:11] <%BoxNavy> 👁️
[4:21:17] <+fetrigon> all according to keikaku
[4:21:21] <i_am_therydon> mmmmm yes look at how smart and evil i am.
[4:21:21] <Raggy_Potaby> I've had enough of your disingenuous assertions
[4:21:27] <PanicSwytch> But the events in Bay 2 caused the series of events that happens in bay 1
[4:21:28] <%Daniel_Is_I> THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER
[4:21:29] <%Keyd00d> well yeah but she won't again
[4:21:31] <mike2hands> AWWW SHUUUUTT UP!!!

[4:21:56] <psilent_p> @raggy_potaby shepard punch
[4:21:58] <heartlesshealer> that's how it goes
[4:21:58] <dinnydanny777> It's probably much simpler than it seems
[4:21:58] <Laecerelius> The ephemeral story
[4:21:58] <%tinyswampthing> same
[4:21:59] <%Aydarkzero> it's like Jak 2!
[4:22:00] <Daveythe6thMoon> So I get that Bayonetta needed to find the power of love to do something or other but did we really need time travel to do that?
[4:22:00] <%SirGO0SE> sometimes i lie to myself about getting it too
[4:22:00] <%Plesin> TIIIIIIME TRAVEL
[4:22:01] <%Daniel_Is_I> WHAT IS THE PLAN HERE???
[4:22:01] <+Over_ninek> it works technically but it's fucking awful

[4:36:23] <xxshadowxx416> bayonetta story is just why
[4:36:23] <%DakotaMacDoodle> alright
[4:36:25] <a_mad_dragon> anti-paradox portal
[4:36:25] <%Ranryu692> it's on a clock face, obviously it's a time travel portal
[4:36:25] <OkamiDude15> O'brian you gotta chuck your child into the time portal
[4:36:27] <+TungstenViper> It's pretty obvious tho
[4:36:27] <Mattapawd> always assume the portal is a time portal
[4:36:30] <%walternatorz> eh, where else are you going to put a kid?
[4:36:31] <Udongein_1> i guess if you can control time in some way you can just...do that lol
[4:36:32] <PrinceOfEden> @Aydarkzero Bro the concept of Jak 2 left me with so many questions.
[4:36:33] <%Fooguwu> It's the portal of Bayonetta's oroboros time-womb
[4:36:37] <%captain_thickthighs> of course the church would have a time travel portal what else would it be stuck in the past.?
[4:36:37] <+Greywyn00> that bed is way to big for that child
[4:36:39] <dukenux> Okay THIS ONE we not gonna explain tho

[4:36:51] <%TalisKanju> There's a dumb part coming up soon
[4:36:54] <Idon__> Supportive mom gives encouragement to herself.
[4:36:54] <+MrAtheGreat> That’s how pat looks on HIS bed.
[4:36:55] <SlippedDisco> BibleThump thanks bayonetta
[4:36:56] <%Daniel_Is_I> "You're gonna want to learn to pole dance at some point, though"

[4:36:57] <+TDotGoat> everything IS just a dream
[4:36:59] <%SaiyanShoto> Toss that child into the time portal like Star Trek

[4:39:30] <heartlesshealer> so how bout that dmc4
[4:39:30] <%hrbeck_> She accepted the power of the Eye in the new continuity
[4:39:30] <TheTakkster> To be fair, you shot him with lipstick
[4:39:32] <%Deft_Thought> Gross
[4:39:33] <%Dementedpenguin> Ew DansGame

[4:39:42] <@SoFarFetched> geefStahp geefStahp geefStahp
[4:39:42] <Hellarussian> this is overly convoluted
[4:39:44] <+JFKRobot> Jeff Epstein was the true villain
[4:39:44] <xxshadowxx416> but she the same person
[4:39:45] <+fetrigon> what
[4:39:46] <%Aydarkzero> das creepy
[4:39:49] <dukenux> Thats illegal
[4:39:49] <%charp35> So ballders plan was to make a time paradox happen?
[4:39:51] <%whyskeywolfe> What do these eyes do, again?
[4:39:52] <OkamiDude15> man even kingdom hearts isnt this dumb
[4:39:52] <dinnydanny777> "I PLANNED TO DIE"
[4:39:53] <%Lion_kun> this plot is garbage nonsense
[4:39:54] <Raggy_Potaby> I don't get it NotLikeThis
[4:39:55] <TerrifyingRei_05> She literally has to seen herself
[4:39:57] <+fetrigon> da fuck
[4:39:58] <heartlesshealer> She had to see a badass lady
[4:40:00] <+CannonHeroBrett> This makes no fucking sense what lol
[4:40:01] <%captain_thickthighs> if he's in a long white gown keep him away from kids seems to be a good rule of thumb
[4:40:02] <+Soulsbjorne> shut up you LOVE Eva lol
[4:40:02] <%Agami23> time travel is dumb
[4:40:03] <intestinal_bleeding> I WAS TIME ALL ALONG
[4:40:05] <dinnydanny777> He planned to die LUL
[4:40:05] <user_naim> I kind of get it now but fuck
[4:40:06] <%Fooguwu> dammit evil david bowie
[4:40:07] <%coffeebearCafe> this story kinda suck lol
[4:40:08] <Laecerelius> LET US RETURN TO OUR HOME PLANET
[4:40:10] <%SGrim> I planned all of this, except all of this!
[4:40:11] <LysdexicAndVolingit> I just fucking read the wiki on his plan and still don't fucking get it
[4:40:12] <olaksi> this is some 3rd Birthday level nonsense
[4:40:14] <PanicSwytch> I meant to lose
[4:40:15] <Profmcstevie> I had 1 pixel left and a Med pack foooled you
[4:40:15] <%SaiyanShoto> I’m not owned!
[4:40:15] <dukenux> All according to keikaku????
[4:40:16] <DianaTheAscian> this is y time travel sucks to write
[4:40:16] <%Lion_kun> At least DMC has character arc narratives with payoffs
[4:40:16] <bettysharkface> I didn't think I could get more confused, but boy oh boy here I am.
[4:40:17] <%whyskeywolfe> The enemy is always The Times
[4:40:18] <%NopeBadguy> THE SAVIOR IS COMING
[4:40:18] <Idon__> "me trying to kill you with the baby chest was actually a trick"
[4:40:18] <Sapphire_Breeze> THE SAVIOR IS COMING
[4:40:20] <ammobasket> 10 minutes later
[4:40:20] <fuji_92> she has to see where being cool, so paradox
[4:40:20] <%TheBensonator_> "The time is at hand" THE TIME FOR WHAT THO
[4:40:20] <+TungstenViper> It's all over the place
[4:40:20] <%captain_thickthighs> Wait this is starting to look familiar
[4:40:21] <%Monkeyweed21> I planned for the writers to not understand time travel !
[4:40:21] <%hrbeck_> Bayonetta made Cereza braver so that she could accept the eye and that fucked everything up
[4:40:22] <$renyrells> oooh thats whats going on Kappa
[4:40:22] <MassageOil> so if bayo just killed herself everything would be fine
[4:40:23] <%Daniel_Is_I> This plan is weird and complicated.
[4:40:23] <%radda343> given the genre it's kind of the right amount of convoluted
[4:40:24] <+PlatinumRevol> I was paradoxing before you killed me!
[4:40:25] <otakon17> I don't think they're getting in a missile
[4:40:25] <Broken_Sonex> YOY FOOL IT WAS MY PLAN TO LOSE
[4:40:25] <mike2hands> is that statue from DMC4
[4:40:26] <%Deft_Thought> #icantbelievethatBayonettaisfuckingdead
[4:40:28] <OkamiDude15> @olaksi man your not even wrong
[4:40:31] <%baka_sugoi> JEBUS MISSEL
[4:40:32] <%AzureGale> Those are some weird earrings
[4:40:33] <+sinistersally> he somehow knew that if he sent her to the future to see what just happen it will set up his plan... somehow
[4:40:33] <ThisGuy198> haha get juked nerd
[4:40:34] <%TriA_l> is that the dmc4 statue

[4:40:40] <dukenux> jesus looking kinda fine tho...
[4:40:40] <mister_z_1994> "Hey you know the ending of DMC4? Let's just do that again"-Kamiya
[4:40:43] <+fetrigon> j-just start the boss fight already. I want to forget this scene happened again LUL
[4:40:44] <Raggy_Potaby> schloop into the statue
[4:40:44] <medril07> this is a good idea
[4:40:45] <+TungstenViper> She was supposed to save her past self to mecome the full left eye i suppose
[4:40:45] <Manwad> is this just the plot of Silent Hill 3
[4:40:45] <DianaTheAscian> oh god it is the dmc4 statue

[4:48:30] <otakon17> WHAT?!
[4:48:30] <dukenux> LUL
[4:48:30] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kamiya was really high when he made them.
[4:48:31] <+TungstenViper> SECRET
[4:48:31] <A_CD_By_Thomas> PLAYING AS JEANE
[4:48:32] <narusao> dumb like a fox
[4:48:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> It made sense when he was high
[4:48:36] <medril07> Where did you go Jeanne?
[4:48:36] <%SaiyanShoto> They totally made sense Kappa
[4:48:43] <Shardlab> Mothafucka
[4:48:47] <+TungstenViper> WHat part of secret did you not get? LUL
[4:48:48] <RyuuAoi> Canon
[4:48:50] <%Keyd00d> Just always run back to the beginning of the level multiple times to make sure Kappa
[4:48:55] <user_naim> Somebody stop Kamiya
[4:48:55] <KeiPrime> hitem with that tetsuzanko
[4:48:57] <+PlatinumRevol> Offsets PogChamp
[4:49:01] <+teh_rawk> so is this bayo with a jeane skin or actually jeane mode?
[4:49:02] <dukenux> Kamiya was high when he made this game, period
[4:49:04] <rytisone> this was never intended to get on your first try
[4:49:05] <+Tonku_the_Red> I always hated how the Alfhiems made you full stop ruin the tension and backtrack for them.
[4:49:09] <user_naim> Just put Bayo 3 on ice
[4:49:11] <Udongein_1> takes more damage too
[4:49:17] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> the cool thing about these games is that the enemy characters are all properly implemented characters under the hood
[4:49:17] <artoflec> @Keyd00d literally yes, trying to find them by myself i would just reach a point and then arbitrarily try to backtrack lmao
[4:49:19] <cherubs_anonymous> She specifically does more damage with weaves
[4:49:22] <%BoxNavy> how do you dodge offset? do you just dodge mid combo then attack?
[4:49:26] <dinnydanny777> So doing this first time must suck
[4:49:31] <Udongein_1> her combo multiplier for weaves is also higher
[4:49:31] <%Aydarkzero> weird
[4:49:43] <%Deft_Thought> Jeanne has different names for her animal forms too, yeah?
[4:49:47] <laserbeaming> only Bat Within and Perfect Moon of Mahakala trigger witch time. Her Wicked Weaves deal more damage.
[4:49:47] <otakon17> that cat noise
[4:49:47] <KeiPrime> hold the button while dodging, then continue for dodge offset i think
[4:49:55] <BleedinActionMan> @BoxNavy Dodge mid combo while holding the attack button
[4:49:57] <otakon17> what is that noise CALLED?
[4:49:59] <otakon17> it's not a roar
[4:50:00] <PrinceOfEden> F
[4:50:00] <Udongein_1> yea: Lynx, moth, and owl
[4:50:04] <otakon17> it's not a hiss or a snarl
[4:50:04] <xeroslash1> @BoxNavy you hold dodge during a combo then hit a button while still holding down dodge after.
[4:50:07] <+PJSmooth> She can also dodge forever
[4:50:08] <%Aydarkzero> d e t h'
[4:50:11] <+TungstenViper> BIG LOSE
[4:50:13] <+balouie> she calls on different demons
[4:50:13] <SaltyDongs> F
[4:50:15] <+featherlan> I thought her Witch Time dodge window was tighter
[4:50:15] <PanicSwytch> Whats the name fir Jeanne's guns?
[4:50:15] <Psyramics> its just a fierce meow
[4:50:17] <RyuuAoi> Oh no it's like Wonder Woman 84 all over again.
[4:50:20] <BleedinActionMan> Instead of Bat Within, it's Moth Within
[4:50:25] <VritraReiRei> I actually came up with part of my name because of one of the names of her weapons :D
[4:50:26] <dinnydanny777> I dislike how the game calls you a FAILURE LUL
[4:50:27] <otakon17> that hit point limit is no joke
[4:50:37] <Broken_Sonex> No Pat, it's pronounced Aerith. Kappa
[4:50:42] <+TungstenViper> Is it wrong to say i like her theme more?
[4:50:45] <+PJSmooth> @PanicSwytch All for One based on the Three Musketeers
[4:50:58] <%arcielardor> Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Lowery's Seasoning Salt
[4:51:06] <Udongein_1> she even has little musketeer charms on her guns
[4:51:06] <PanicSwytch> @pjsmooth thanks

[5:01:10] <@SSaryn> I forgot she gets a unique life bar too.
[5:01:17] <bakkatohri> Stupid sexy Jubileus
[5:01:36] <otakon17> Jubileus finally woke up, asorbed Peacock Man and is unhinged due to missing an eye
[5:01:40] <otakon17> meaning she's gone mad
[5:01:43] <user_naim> this boss is pretty good
[5:01:47] <DickieWoodsmall_279> woah, jubileus fights with her hair? that's so weird, who else would do that?
[5:01:50] <%Aydarkzero> purple health bar? guess she has 6 bars of life
[5:02:00] <Noogiez> she aint that tough, her vag doesnt even glow
[5:02:02] <+EyeFarted> @PatStaresAt Why does GOD have just ONE more power bar than JEANNE??

[5:04:42] <Udongein_1> thi part gives me s much trouble

[5:05:41] <laserbeaming> I never had this much trouble with this fight
[5:05:43] <%Maids4lyfe> I hated this fight because of that
[5:05:43] <Idon__> at least the music is cool
[5:05:45] <Udongein_1> its so finicky
[5:05:47] <otakon17> HEAL DAMMIT
[5:05:49] <NeroInfinite> yeaht his part was abit fucky for me too
[5:05:51] <RoboticRexkek> the jump prompt is a bit fucked.
[5:05:53] <NitronStreams> just as bad as the stupid floating platforms in dmc4 savior fight
[5:05:53] <%Piemono> Not as smooth as you want a final fight to be
[5:05:58] <%YakumoYomi> Ah yes, the PS3/360 era's obsession with QTEs
[5:06:00] <%NopeBadguy> I guess it's still the Savior for better and for worse
[5:06:02] <%BoxNavy> yep
[5:06:02] <bomfiz> yup
[5:06:03] <%Aydarkzero> looks like it
[5:06:05] <secretbosssauce> It's always been goofy
[5:06:07] <Profmcstevie> Every prompt in this game is goofy
[5:06:07] <Udongein_1> the platforms should just not move
[5:06:08] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> pouting god
[5:06:10] <+fetrigon> a smidge
[5:06:18] <artoflec> ive never seen what it looks like to fall in this part lol
[5:06:21] <bomfiz> it's really mechanically inconsistent.
[5:06:24] <%AzureGale> I'm gonna have to juuuUUUuuump
[5:06:27] <%Aydarkzero> @YakumoYomi you can thank the ps2 era for that
[5:06:36] <laserbeaming> can I say that I LOVE her HP bar?
[5:06:37] <otakon17> "Hey guys, let's put MAJOR PLATFORMING IN OUR FINAL BOSS FIGHT! IN A BRAWLER WHERE PLATFORMING IS AN AFTERTHOUGHT AT BEST!"

[5:15:08] <laserbeaming> witches don't take fall damage
[5:15:11] <otakon17> @ScreamLord they gotta break it up into smaller pieces first, the statue is several miles TALL
[5:15:14] <TerrifyingRei_05> And they died due to no heat shield

[5:16:58] <%NopeBadguy> God is corrupt
[5:16:59] <@SSaryn> Well, they also get turned into the high level fuckos too don't they?
[5:17:00] <%Aydarkzero> das just how it be
[5:17:01] <LysdexicAndVolingit> Hell fucks; 'nough say
[5:17:01] <ammobasket> isn't that like exactly the God deal?
[5:17:01] <Manwad> why can't they just fight Hell
[5:17:02] <laserbeaming> BUT POWER
[5:17:02] <Profmcstevie> The devil makes deals that suck
[5:17:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> From the looks of it, Heaven in this game is also fucked up
[5:17:03] <TerrifyingRei_05> Who says heaven is a good place?
[5:17:04] <%Monkeyweed21> The sages are servants for the Angels @PatStaresAt
[5:17:04] <A_CD_By_Thomas> It's who you made a deal with
[5:17:05] <%Ne1son> They picked the wrong team
[5:17:05] <%DashXero> They knew what they signed up for.
[5:17:06] <%BoxNavy> god hates witches
[5:17:06] <rytisone> just don't die
[5:17:07] <%SirGO0SE> but hell kicks ass in this universe
[5:17:07] <RyuuAoi> Dark Magic
[5:17:07] <RoboticRexkek> but they look cool af
[5:17:08] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Heaven ain't great either
[5:17:09] <+Over_ninek> Heaven looks nice but it's probably not at all welcoming
[5:17:09] <NitronStreams> Heavy isnt great in this world either
[5:17:10] <Daveythe6thMoon> Life's a witch and then you die.
[5:17:10] <oOZtkOo> i mean the demons seem pretty strong
[5:17:10] <DianaTheAscian> whats Father Rodins deal?
[5:17:10] <Crystallux> heaven isnt that great either
[5:17:10] <DickieWoodsmall_279> @patstaresat how do you know heaven doesn't suck just as bad?
[5:17:11] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> heaven is for fucking NERDS pat are you a NERD
[5:17:11] <OkamiDude15> the witches sold their soul to the devil for the big magics i guess
[5:17:11] <%Keyd00d> they both suck
[5:17:12] <%SirGO0SE> hell is where all the booba is
[5:17:12] <$RealThiele> but immortal tho
[5:17:13] <A_CD_By_Thomas> Also yeah the angels are just as fucked, so
[5:17:13] <cherubs_anonymous> @PatStaresAt The sages don't exactly go to heaven, they merge with an angel ship
[5:17:13] <fuji_92> both suck imo
[5:17:13] <dukenux> thats the deal
[5:17:13] <%Agami23> pat you just spent an entire game fighting angels. would you want to be around them???
[5:17:13] <heartlesshealer> the angels probably eat
[5:17:13] <BleedinActionMan> @PatStaresAt Sages get to go to heaven, but they gotta do the angel's bidding
[5:17:14] <%BoxNavy> black magicks and all that
[5:17:14] <%Ranryu692> is heaven even worth going to in this universe?
[5:17:14] <Twoiis> Is heaven all that it is cracked up to be in Bayo universe?
[5:17:15] <%Ynkubus_> I dont think heavens that good in this setting
[5:17:15] <%TalisKanju> Heaven also sucks in this game @PatStaresAt
[5:17:17] <%whyskeywolfe> It's a heroic sacrifice shhh
[5:17:18] <%weissguard> What part of the Trinity of Realities are the Witches tied to? Inferno. So hell it is!
[5:17:19] <%LaughingCatt> Honestly Heaven doesnt seem great in this universe
[5:17:20] <%Deft_Thought> Who wants to hang out with horrible bug angels
[5:17:20] <heybenice> Are witches more powerful?
[5:17:21] <%Keyd00d> Hell has cool imagery
[5:17:21] <%debugdrawray_> wasnt the deal tho that hell powers are also immortality?
[5:17:21] <DrStinkers> going to heaven means turning into the angel jobbers
[5:17:24] <tubit> A shrubbery!
[5:17:26] <Nordguy> you think heaven is cool in bayoverse?
[5:17:27] <MassageOil> heaven is just hell but everything is bright instead of on fire
[5:17:28] <$RealThiele> snake?
[5:17:28] <Vcom7418> You saw what the angels is like throughout the whole game didn't you?
[5:17:29] <%coffeebearCafe> wow
[5:17:30] <%Jashter18> I think the idea is both are bad options
[5:17:30] <%Monkeyweed21> the sages become servants forever to the angels
[5:17:31] <%Lunaticbro > But have you seen the angels
[5:17:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> The whole point of this game is that Heaven in Hell is basically the same shit, just Heaven tries to make itself LOOK better
[5:17:36] <%SirGO0SE> heaven has 0 nipple
[5:17:40] <DianaTheAscian> aw
[5:17:43] <ChungusQuest> It's heaven-based propaganda: the devil is totally down with witches and they all party for eternity
[5:17:44] <%NopeBadguy> Like I remember that one podcast convo you and Woolie had about how God isn't real and the devil is, and the one-up of that is God and the devil are in collusion LUL
[5:17:45] <RyuuAoi> NotLikeThis
[5:17:46] <otakon17> that's a lotta lilacs
[5:17:47] <+BigDumBeak> nah, its fair cuz sages are lame af and witches ARE COOL AF
[5:17:48] <%WhereIsWill> is that supposed to be Joe Pesci???
[5:17:51] <%Deft_Thought> Luka shrugs a lot
[5:17:52] <%baka_sugoi> just cut down a bush
[5:17:53] <Crystallux> if you havent played bayo 2 yet, it goes into a bit more detail on heavens side.
[5:17:55] <%BoxNavy> :)
[5:17:55] <%Deft_Thought> That's mostly what he does
[5:17:57] <RoboticRexkek> uh?
[5:17:57] <Laecerelius> The sages probably have to like clean up the angels' horrible goo or something
[5:18:01] <medril07> press f to pay respects

[5:19:11] <dukenux> i like nun Jeanne
[5:19:11] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> She faked her death to Bait angels and fuck with her friends?
[5:19:14] <heartlesshealer> @PatStaresAt One of the opening cutscenes with Jeanne showed normal-ass believers dying and turning into angels/Affinity. So that's probably how heaven is. Just turning into heaven-flavored demon
[5:19:15] <DianaTheAscian> BUT WHY?

[5:22:37] <CursedNobleman> thatll do
[5:22:38] <Profmcstevie> Bit of a redundant statement there Kappa
[5:22:39] <Monkeyweed21> glasses and jemdom
[5:22:39] <+PJSmooth> He would not budge on the glasses
[5:22:39] <HeroToxiko> and short hair
[5:22:39] <%coffeebearCafe> nice lol
[5:22:39] <otakon17> she gave her the proportions of a giraffe
[5:22:40] <medril07> hot librairian I think
[5:22:40] <%SirGO0SE> "these are my fetishes, fulfill them"
[5:22:40] <Sapphire_Breeze> 👍
[5:22:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah
[5:22:42] <laserbeaming> "I can work under those terms"
[5:22:43] <dinnydanny777> Glasses themselves are hot
[5:22:44] <Daveythe6thMoon> Also the guns. She needed 4 guns.
[5:22:45] <dukenux> pretty much
[5:22:48] <+PenmanLupine> a woman that would make him feel like a cherry boy again
[5:22:48] <a_mad_dragon> and the execs told them to lose the glasses, and they just didn't
[5:22:50] <+fetrigon> Checkout Maiko Masai . She's the dance choreographer for bayonetta. ***
[5:22:53] <%WhereIsWill> Mari said LEGS FOR ETERNITY
[5:22:53] <%Monkeyweed21> glasses, tall, femdom
[5:22:53] <dukenux> glasses or nothing
[5:22:54] <+BettyMwwaahh> Probably "tall" too
[5:22:56] <otakon17> "Legs you could mistake for tree trunks"

[5:23:07] <TheSphereHunter> Mari Shimazaki drew like 2000s bayos
[5:23:12] <%arcielardor> I still say She's gender-swapped Kojima
[5:23:14] <+gnoame> These legs go all the way up to jupiter
[5:23:15] <+TheotherKristian> So he proceeded to put glasses on everyone
[5:23:16] <+fetrigon> ***
[5:23:18] <olaksi> when the execs told them to loose the glasses, they instead gave EVERYONE glasses
[5:23:21] <Daveythe6thMoon> "Mr. Kamiya glasses are a bad idea for your main character." "Okay, I get what you're saying!" *EVERYONE GETS GLASSES*
[5:23:22] <otakon17> Goddamn this music hits though
[5:23:23] <artoflec> Mari comes from a fashion design background so she already drew proportions that way too i would imagine

[5:32:42] <Valentinius_Anodyne> The Switch ports are pretty good too, and it's probably the easiest way to play 2 nowadays
[5:32:44] <%king_wragles> @BoxNavy I think the only way to get Bayo 1 on Switch is by buying 2
[5:32:50] <@SSaryn> waow
[5:32:50] <%BoxNavy> :)
[5:32:50] <%king_wragles> -I THINK-
[5:32:57] <+gnoame> unblockable train

[5:33:40] <dukenux> but we've seen plenty of tit bits?
[5:33:43] <DickieWoodsmall_279> in fact bayo 2 comes with an eShop code

[5:34:41] <heartlesshealer> yeah pat doesn't have enough halos for the cheat phone
[5:34:41] <%BoxNavy> if pats doing what i think he is then it will help with the cheat phone

[6:03:18] <%Keyd00d> remember amiibos
[6:03:20] <%Monkeyweed21> you want the gaze of despair equipped
[6:03:23] <RyuuAoi> Amiibos ha
[6:03:54] <%Monkeyweed21> use angel weapons to get shittons of points, then fail right at the end
[6:04:04] <%NopeBadguy> iirc from what the dude said earlier, you get a shitzillion points from the angel arms, then fail the mission near the end to keep the halos and redo it
[6:04:19] <%Monkeyweed21> you have to keep the combo going
[6:04:22] <%ssjklyco> This seems worst than the other one
[6:04:39] <%Monkeyweed21> stale combo
[6:04:41] <RyuuAoi> ONE GUY

[6:04:51] <%NopeBadguy> can't let the combo get stale

[6:04:55] <otakon17> huh?
[6:05:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Stale combo
[6:05:01] <%Monkeyweed21> its way harder but faster IIRC

[6:06:29] <%ssjklyco> Wasn't that supposed to be the better way than the guaranteed 1 million?
[6:06:29] <%NopeBadguy> it's a harder farm i guess
[6:06:29] <heartlesshealer> =)
[6:06:29] <Revant_tillywink> sorry he thought you were good Kappa
[6:06:31] <%Aydarkzero> it wasn't true?
[6:06:31] <RyuuAoi> Pat doesn't have five minutes!
[6:06:31] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Absolutely jebaited
[6:06:32] <+TungstenViper> because if you're good it's faster. but since you suck...
[6:06:33] <RoboticRexkek> you will get more halo... in a day or two
[6:06:34] <%Ranryu692> presumably once you know, it's always easier
[6:06:34] <%SirGO0SE> monkeyweed been killing it with the one guys lately LUL
[6:06:35] <%Monkeyweed21> Its hard but you get about 1 million if you do it right
[6:06:36] <DianaTheAscian> what is Pat grinding for?
[6:06:38] <sirkingofbooty> sadness
[6:06:40] <%Keyd00d> :)
[6:06:41] <%Capta1n_H3nry> Completely destroyed
[6:06:41] <%ssjklyco> that doesn't seem faster
[6:06:41] <otakon17> Pat is AVERAGE
[6:06:41] <willsin4fun> Make sure your magic is maxed out (use candy if necessary) and go up to the blue head. When you're standing next to it, activate witch time with the bracelet of time and constantly keep performing the Durga/Kilgore glitch. If your magic starts running out, refill it with candy. Keep doing this until you've killed Fortitudo. If you did it right, you now have at least 20 million halos (with the gaze of despair equipped) and a combo so large it gets visually maxed out on the result screen.
[6:06:43] <olaksi> git gud

[6:11:43] <%Dakuu75> SIC
[6:11:47] <RoboticRexkek> is it because of the super secret weapon that the 100% time is around 50hrs on how long to beat?

[6:18:01] <ChungusQuest> yay, more wacky woohoo lipstick lady
[6:18:03] <%NopeBadguy> Was the TMNT Plat game any good?
[6:18:10] <%NopeBadguy> I think that's the only Plat game I never played
[6:18:11] <scotianunicorn> monkeyweed was the main character of twitch chat tonight
[6:18:11] <NitronStreams> SICK
[6:18:12] <%NopeBadguy> And I really wanted to
[6:18:24] <Profmcstevie> The TMNT platinum game was kind of a mess
[6:18:27] <%FacetiousAF> @NopeBadguy far as i've HEARD no
[6:18:29] <%NopeBadguy> But it was like delisted in like less than a year NotLikeThis
[6:18:31] <%Monkeyweed21> this time was a big ol fuckup I'm sorry for wasting time
[6:18:33] <RyuuAoi> @nopebadguy I heard bad things.
[6:18:35] <cherubs_anonymous> Is the damage really the same?
[6:18:35] <zekana> tmnt was alright. just repetitive
[6:18:48] <%FacetiousAF> platinum Transformers was fine imo
[6:18:49] <%herecomesmong0> herecomesmong0 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 10 months, currently on a 10 month streak! Hey Pat, Mongo here happy new years and here's to ten more months.
[6:18:51] <rytisone> nope
[6:18:53] <%XeroSigmaPrime> TMNT was one of Platinum's best games
[6:18:54] <marvel877> don't bother with the TMNT plat game. i rented that back when redbox still had game rentals and returned it an hour later.
[6:18:55] <%Alazull> Thanks for the 2020ByeGuys @herecomesmong0
[6:19:03] <%Deft_Thought> TMNT and Legend of Korra were both meh
[6:19:05] <RyuuAoi> Secrets?
[6:19:17] <%Monkeyweed21> there's a few phones here
[6:19:19] <%Ranryu692> Legend of Korra was good for the price
[6:19:36] <DrkJP520> who you gonna call
[6:19:37] <%charp35> all those licensed platinum games were pretty meh
[6:19:37] <koffeemancer> Are we going right into Bayo 2 after this? @PatStaresAt
[6:19:39] <%NopeBadguy> I never had much interest in the Korra game but it seemed fun
[6:19:42] <+DohoRX> Platinum games make great games as long as they are not licensed titles
[6:19:46] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Korra is meh but TMNT is like a near perfect 10/10, the stutter on the final levels docks it slightly
[6:19:48] <%NopeBadguy> I remember getting really hype for Mutants in Manhattan
[6:19:54] <%NopeBadguy> But I just never played it
[6:20:03] <rytisone> well...
[6:20:05] <paralars_> got scammed LUL
[6:20:07] <%Ranryu692> did you ever have it?
[6:20:09] <%Dakuu75> what's he trying to do?
[6:20:16] <%Dementedpenguin> That's the first time I heard someone say Platinum TMNT is a 10/10 o_O
[6:20:17] <artoflec> the TMNT game is definitely the worst it got...the korra game is competent in comparison
[6:20:18] <+TheDoopad> the tmnt one would be fun of you scammed 3 others into buying it
[6:20:20] <%ssjklyco> ONe guyed again
[6:20:23] <%Dementedpenguin> *near
[6:20:26] <+cowkid222> transforms thought I always felt was pretty good, a bit short and some meh driving but it looked great I thought
[6:20:26] <eros104> Get a New Weapon?
[6:20:39] <%crazyspartan214> pillow talk?
[6:20:39] <fuji_92> he's looking it up, chat there's no one guy
[6:20:40] <NeroInfinite> WHERE IS PILLOW TALK?
[6:20:41] <%NopeBadguy> @XeroSigmaPrime Everyone else seems to be saying it's bad, why do you say it's good?
[6:20:42] <Ramasama13> maybe buy from rodin?
[6:20:42] <+Over_ninek> restart?
[6:20:45] <%NopeBadguy> Defend it for me
[6:20:46] <Vyneci> Exit the chapter and go back in?
[6:20:49] <%DashXero> Do you need to beat the stage?
[6:20:49] <%ssjklyco> Is it in the store?
[6:20:56] <rytisone> you got scalped
[6:20:57] <DrkJP520> maybe that was a code for something else
[6:20:59] <%XeroSigmaPrime> Are you guys crazy? the TMNT game was fucking amazing
[6:21:02] <RyuuAoi> SAVE
[6:21:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe store?
[6:21:04] <outer_monologue> wrong code. got regular guns from beginning of game
[6:21:26] <+TungstenViper> wtf
[6:21:28] <@SSaryn> Oh no
[6:21:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[6:21:32] <cherubs_anonymous> @outer_monologue He unlocked those from beating the game though
[6:21:36] <Profmcstevie> The handguns that we already had?
[6:21:36] <fuji_92> he got the handguns from being the game tho
[6:21:37] <%MelBrooksKA> amazing
[6:21:41] <fuji_92> *beating
[6:21:44] <Vyneci> Inb4 inputted the code for Jeanne that also costs 1 million LUL
[6:21:45] <eros104> Oh No~
[6:21:46] <%charp35> No he got the handguns for beating the game
[6:21:50] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @NopeBadguy Sick combat, tons of level variety, MANY characters with VASTLY different playstyles. A top tier NG+ mode that basically an entirely new story
[6:21:52] <+Dova573> I could never figure out how to do the codes and get the secret weapons
[6:21:53] <otakon17> Up, Up, Up, Up, Down, Down, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, A
[6:21:55] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Is it the right code on the Switch version?
[6:22:12] <otakon17> Upx4, Downx4, L,R,L,R, A
[6:22:31] <fuji_92> would it tho
[6:22:33] <%Dementedpenguin> @XeroSigmaPrime personally never played it myself, I was just taken aback. LUL
[6:22:37] <otakon17> I guess B on the Switch
[6:22:43] <DrkJP520> Did you check the inventory now that you've entered another mission?
[6:22:52] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @NopeBadguy Combat can be sligtly basic with Raph and Donatello tho
[6:22:53] <%Dementedpenguin> always heard the opposite
[6:22:54] <otakon17> maybe the code doesn't work on the Swich?
[6:23:08] <KeiPrime> nah there was a confirm sound
[6:23:09] <fuji_92> yeah, we heard the ching
[6:23:12] <KeiPrime> so something activated
[6:23:15] <RyuuAoi> It's a port...it should
[6:23:17] <paralars_> god damn phone scammers
[6:23:19] <rytisone> no more John Halo
[6:23:24] <scotianunicorn> scammed
[6:23:25] <%Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> your rare halos are now at the bottom of the ocean
[6:23:28] <Vyneci> Maybe you actually put the wrong code and unlocked Jeanne
[6:23:30] <KeiPrime> you got robbed
[6:23:30] <paralars_> somebody call kitboga
[6:23:31] <+TungstenViper> wtf
[6:23:32] <%charp35> check if it unlocked jean maybe they just kept the input the same as xbox where b gets you the character
[6:23:36] <+TheotherKristian> Reload save maybe?
[6:23:39] <+whyskeywolfe> This is a pretty elaborate prank
[6:23:41] <fuji_92> Casually scammed LUL
[6:23:41] <%XeroSigmaPrime> @Dementedpenguin IDK why people who never played it review bomb it. Try it out, first hour sucks but it opens up HARD after the 3rd level
[6:23:45] <RyuuAoi> DISAPPOINTED
[6:23:45] <KeiPrime> check costumes
[6:23:46] <scotianunicorn> just gave the game all your bitcoin
[6:23:53] <Vyneci> Can you go to New Game to check? Because unlocking Jeanne also costs 1 million halos
[6:23:55] <outer_monologue> character maybe then
[6:23:56] <paralars_> monkeyweed was behind it all!
[6:24:21] <KeiPrime> monkeyweed strikes again
[6:24:25] <%Dementedpenguin> hmm, now I'm curious
