[0:11:40] <%lewdskeletor13> @nitronlviii apatDab
[0:11:42] <+Ell1ot> did you buy a used controller? What if they put their dick on it before you bought it?
[0:11:43] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Looks like a poop
[0:11:43] <DougintheTrench> Is it the same controller?
[0:11:44] <buck_nastiest> l a m e s t o p
[0:11:44] <alrobot2014> how can you handle having a white controller, doesn't the dust and grime become more noticable
[0:11:45] <Bouldus> the first ones that came out dont have that problem
[0:11:46] <derekwst3> blow on the button
[0:11:46] <%Harawanagangsta> Its not that way on Mine Pat

[0:11:48] <+Punisher7771> no
[0:11:48] <%SergeEXE> Switch Pro Controller is Better
[0:11:51] <AmericanaRed> Same controller
[0:11:52] <%Fadedblank247> did you get a free copy of fallout 76 with it

[0:12:00] <+Punisher7771> @PeachSaliva sup page
[0:12:01] <%Vidsigma> No I'm too poor
[0:12:01] <Kaneis> The Elites have a short lifespan, mine only lasted 6 months
[0:12:02] <$HentaiSenpai9K> And so Gamestop cast itself from the highest peak in all of Canada
[0:12:03] <derekwst3> Blow on the button it works
[0:12:03] <nobody12349> No because I'm not elite
[0:12:04] <dekkitout> Why the select button and not- oh I don't know....THE 'A' BUTTON
[0:12:05] <%waifoong98> just use keyboard Kappa

[0:12:06] <Gameslayer2> Your first mistake was buying an xbox controller
[0:12:06] <%ElenaManetta> Why not return it and get it on Amazon?

[0:12:07] <%Das_Bass> i use a dual shock
[0:12:07] <AmericanaRed> Why WutFace
[0:12:09] <%Keaton_x> I've got an Elite and it works great. It's not the white one though.
[0:12:09] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat some 360 controllers have a similar issue with the "back" button - I have one that's oddly recessed and requires a firmer pressure to activate.
[0:12:09] <%Remery_> mines a little shtty

[0:13:20] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 Mages ascend to one of many possible alternate, yet still wrong, philosophies of how reality works, which enables magic. But the consensus makes magic harder and you need to hide it or make it seem coincidental to onlookers or you'll suffer from Paradox, which causes myriad consequences. If you're gonna teleport a gun into your hand or create one from scratch, you better be reaching into a duffel bag or something.

[0:18:34] <%ElenaManetta> @emillionghost Med schools were DESPERATE for bodies for their students to study/practice with, so they didn't want to question. H.H. Holmes was the first serial killer in America, so it never crossed anyone's mind.

[0:22:45] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I found a reddit thread talking about manufacturing errors in the white elite controller - it's quite possible there's similar QC issues with this new model. If you got two in a row with the same issue either it's an idiosyncrasy of the controller itself, or an actual malfunction, but either way the result is the same.

[0:26:27] <%spiritofmojave> I'm with Woolie, it needed big fat anime ass
[0:26:27] <%blastazoid26> Sekiro needed more bobs
[0:26:29] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I don't disagree

[0:26:43] <+zanzibar_junker> ShindoL already did sekiro boobs
[0:26:44] <%Futurecity10> Japan is the embodiment of "Are yah winning son?"
[0:26:46] <CastellanVon> Sekiro should respect it's players and add busty anime MILFs
[0:26:48] <%Appleauce101> all it needs is some big anime biddies
[0:26:54] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat That arrow to the knee one is actually only kinda trash
[0:26:55] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Wait hatch?
[0:26:59] <+burnley95> pat you can't criticize japan for their incest kink, you are dating your sister doodBait
[0:26:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Hatch?
[0:26:59] <%sshen> They put out another article saying no sekiro doesnt need anime tiddies
[0:27:02] <NotHereToStream> generic af
[0:27:06] <dakuman13> Days Gone. lol
[0:27:06] <%Ilpala> yes it does
[0:27:08] <TwinBat> painfully generic
[0:27:09] <SkyPirateArcane> Yeeeeeep
[0:27:10] <%QueequegTheater> Does it have big anime tiddies
[0:27:10] <$HentaiSenpai9K> It's super generic
[0:27:11] <Bouldus> Dayz gone looksl ike a zombie game, which are realyl fucking boring now
[0:27:11] <alrobot2014> it looks like 2010 personified
[0:27:12] <+skylerpilot> "Sekiro needs to respect its players and add big anime titties" gave me a good laugh
[0:27:17] <%AncelDeLambert> just got here, what game?
[0:27:18] <+HelveticaScenario> ouch
[0:27:20] <starotter70> Sounds right
[0:27:20] <%spiritofmojave> oh god are Ride to Hell devs doing that forgettable shit
[0:27:21] <%The_Esquana> Looks like a video game based off of every video game
[0:27:21] <gustavozxd> I hate the days gone trailers because it's so forced with "EMOSHONS" like david cage games
[0:27:25] <dakuman13> That's said.
[0:27:26] <%QueequegTheater> Sekiro absolutely does not need big anime tiddies
[0:27:28] <dakuman13> sad*
[0:27:28] <%Afterman_> im into Days Gone purely for the main character's actor
[0:27:29] <%GohanEgret> @AncelDeLambert bible black
[0:27:30] <CrypticMochi> So I just tuned to hear “isekai about grabbing your mom’s boobs.” I’m confused.
[0:27:30] <Mr_Strut> Ride to Hell seems a little harsh
[0:27:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> @AncelDeLambert Koozies
[0:27:34] <%ElenaManetta> But Qwark is your favorite character right???
[0:27:35] <DracaenaLeaf> Good tastes still
[0:27:35] <Daxalog> The 3rds the best IMO
[0:27:36] <$RubberFistFight> @skylerpilot did you see the followup? "No sekiro absolutely does not need big anime titties"
[0:27:37] <%Shadowthedigger> Aw damn, cause 3 is the best one.
[0:27:43] <yourliteraldog> Days gone looks like a really polished generic idea
[0:27:44] <majima666> it looks ok, but with the amount of zombie games in the last 10 years. ok isnt good enough

[0:28:10] <Finaldragoon> doodKen
[0:28:10] <%zalonar> their personalities are pretty close
[0:28:11] <TheBlankAce> Majima has so much more than a bat
[0:28:12] <nobody12349> Let's look over Japan's values. Child Porn=kind of bad. Incest=okay? Cocaine=completely unacceptable.
[0:28:12] <%Thalchampz> @hawk_rush thank you dude

[0:28:20] <FackinCrazy> MAH BOAT
[0:28:23] <%goose_attack_almanac> But Negan and Majima have very different personalities and roles
[0:28:24] <@SSaryn> HOW FUCKING DARE YOU MAJIMA
[0:28:25] <CastellanVon> Negan is not the same personality as Majima. Not even slightly.
[0:28:25] <%Afterman_> negan kills Alpha with a knife so
[0:28:32] <%Appleauce101> negan confirmed for majima skin using striker style

[0:31:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> what a fade
[0:31:59] <%GeneralSCPatton> cheer500 In older editions of Mage and Vampire, because Vampires were considered to be non-living, technically, any Mage with like 1 level in the Sphere of Matter could just transmute a Vampire into a chair or any other simple inanimate object. More recent editions make it much harder, requiring a decent level in the Spheres of Life and/or Spirit to manipulate their physical form.

[0:35:51] <dakuman13> is kiryu single-handedly more detrimental to the population of japan than its birth rate crisis?
[0:36:10] <majima666> i find it hard to get excited for bl3, knowing how bad looter shooters are now with monetisation. 2k are a big offender in that regard too
[0:36:19] <%Quentinmr> MECH SUITS
[0:36:20] <alexandrecau> well no kiryu doesn't kill no detrimdnt
[0:36:21] <$bootysteve> Kiryu is a good boy and has never once killed anybody @dakuman13
[0:36:26] <$Gehtingsberg> Uh huh
[0:36:30] <yourliteraldog> Fun Fact Yakuza still practice Seppuku
[0:36:34] <xeros720> he makes several women preg each game so it balances out
[0:36:38] <QaizerArt> "Mr. Pitchford, we'd like you to take a week long course on magic, if you are interested, just sign here!" "OH BOY!!!" And the contract says 'The Magic of HOW TO MANAGE A COMPANY'

[0:37:27] <%Quentinmr> you either unionize the whole cast or have no union

[0:37:39] <%zanzibar_junker> TIME FOR GODSPEED sounds cool
[0:37:40] <dekkitout> Oh lord, are we back on Chuck Norris jokes
[0:37:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @bootysteve no one really knows. Randy says Troy was offered but he refused. Baker is saying he had some talks but learned from the trailer that they went with someone else

[0:40:41] <%these_pockets> Is kiwami a prequel? If so, I'd find it interesting is past games referenced it. I always wondered if Zero fit in like that as a casual onlooker of the series

[0:42:20] <dekkitout> Kiwami means big heart
[0:42:20] <televisedrevolting> Bitch maybe
[0:42:21] <%Solidnick18> yakuzas have big hearts
[0:42:23] <$Gehtingsberg> LUL
[0:42:24] <%Fenrirlives> factually incorrect!
[0:42:25] <starotter70> It takes LOVE to be a Yakuza
[0:42:25] <%MonsieurHedge> that's a metaphor for shooting yourself three times in the back
[0:42:26] <%these_pockets> Murder him gently...? KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS LOVE. Telling my whole life with HIS SONG. Killing me softly with his love, killing me SOFTLY~ with HIS LOVE
[0:42:26] <%spiritofmojave> Yakuza are a bunch of big hearted heroes
[0:42:29] <ShichiNoBushi> So I will give them your enormous heart. Then they will give me the promotion.
[0:42:29] <%castcode> lmao
[0:42:30] <lizard0tm> "kid"
[0:42:30] <+aivalera> No one is kinder and more honorable than Yakuza
[0:42:31] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that is not a kid
[0:42:31] <%lewdskeletor13> YAKUZAS ARE GOOD GUYS
[0:42:31] <dakuman13> Kano you do not look like a kid whatsoever.
[0:42:33] <%MightyMaxT> The real Yakuza were the friends we made along the way
[0:42:33] <%Solidnick18> and that's really all that matters
[0:42:34] <%Laecerelius> Those criminals are so honorable!
[0:42:39] <+dawsfloss> why is pat always in PJ's?
[0:42:39] <%thelonechris> That's an old looking kid
[0:42:42] <dakuman13> Kano looks older than Kiryu
[0:42:43] <lizard0tm> Looks like he's in his late 40's
[0:42:47] <%Solidnick18> FeelsGoodMan
[0:42:47] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Listen to this early 90s Yacht Rock
[0:42:49] <%Afterman_> why WOULDNT he be in pjs
[0:42:49] <%SaltyDongs> Kiryu you drawing any parallels
[0:42:54] <%king_wragles> This kind of stuff is a lot less funny when you realize the guy writing this is 100% serious
[0:42:56] <%GeneralSCPatton> THE PLOT IS apatBig DUMB
[0:42:57] <starotter70> Drug cartel? What's that?
[0:42:58] <%Solidnick18> you got a dagger
[0:42:58] <+aivalera> TO STAB YOU
[0:42:58] <%spiritofmojave> Kiwami means LOVE
[0:43:01] <Dr_Mooose> Yakuza's are the real hero's
[0:43:02] <Strayed1> MASTERWORK dagger
[0:43:05] <$bootysteve> I'm just picturing the creator's yakuza friends standing in the writing room just hovering over them
[0:43:06] <alexandrecau> The best killing knife
[0:43:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> gotta cut your pinky off with something
[0:43:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Masterwork Dagger? So it gives +1 to attack rolls?
[0:43:12] <%MagickBurritoh> He was going to stab you in the back
[0:43:16] <DracaenaLeaf> Kid
[0:43:18] <dakuman13> what a said strange little man
[0:43:19] <%shiplord13> You are a failure stop and leave
[0:43:20] <alexandrecau> He sliced Sonya's partner ear to ear with it
[0:43:20] <%Quentinmr> nani
[0:43:22] <lizard0tm> """"Kid""""
[0:43:24] <%spiritofmojave> these subquests are stupid
[0:43:30] <starotter70> Love that 30 year old kid
[0:43:30] <%Solidnick18> what a good sub story
[0:43:30] <+aivalera> Kano was later killed in Mortal Kombat
[0:43:31] <gustavozxd> this is like the people that consider pablo escobar a hero TO THIS DAY
[0:43:41] <yourliteraldog> No they don't organized crime is literally capitalism that doesn't even pretend to acknowledge ethics
[0:43:42] <starotter70> Card
[0:43:56] <+aivalera> And he was never heard from again
[0:43:56] <%MonsieurHedge> god fuck does anyone know any good ramen places in the entire GTA
[0:43:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> They're masterworks all you can't go wrong
[0:44:06] <%PlainSimpleTailor> There are people who still consider Shoko Asahara to be their hero...
[0:44:08] <ScrapSentinel> umai
[0:44:14] <YellowDays> how far in is pat now
[0:44:20] <dakuman13> imagine if the age of consent in japan was actually 30 years old

[0:45:15] <dakuman13> thats so stupid the way he swings that bat around lol
[0:45:18] <alexandrecau> Taxation is the real crime in Japan
[0:45:20] <CopperTucker> Majima fucks
[0:45:21] <majindusto> Hey Look, Majima is using a BASEBALL BAT!!!
[0:45:23] <%korth367> BIG POISE FOR BIG MAJIBOlS
[0:45:27] <+zackmuffin> They do big crimes

[0:45:36] <$SleepyMaribo> i just used Beaststyle for every majima encounter, his ai cant seem to handle it
[0:45:36] <$Gehtingsberg> Audit the Fed
[0:45:37] <%connos_livereview> apatBig LUL

[0:46:00] <dekkitout> XD
[0:46:01] <dakuman13> hes fucking dead are you serious
[0:46:01] <%Solidnick18> he's good
[0:46:03] <thecrabgodrulerofcrabs> its kinda funny to me that were all saying this when the overarching message is kiryu and co. are all naive idiots looking at a false idea of what the yakuza are while all the villains are real shit yakuza and they never just leave the yakuza because they cant and refuse to give up on their ideals
[0:46:07] <OhioNitsud> guess what, I let you hit me more
[0:46:09] <%El_Desperad0> When are you going to upgrade Dragon style?
[0:46:11] <%Laecerelius> The evil Majima, Creator of Sales Tax!
[0:46:18] <+eagleclassgamer> @AngriestPat What does pot of greed do?
[0:46:19] <+Grayhammatter> pat's getting his ass blasted
[0:46:28] <%Solidnick18> ORA
[0:46:29] <Lindaru13> Homeruuun
[0:46:31] <%GeneralSCPatton> They wanna be gangstars tho
[0:46:40] <ShichiNoBushi> There should be a mod that replaces all the health drinks with Red Bulls.
[0:46:42] <alexandrecau> most of the villains in yakuza are government businessmen and foreigners
[0:46:44] <Lindaru13> OOOF
[0:46:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@eagleclassgamer) (warning)
[0:46:48] <+Grayhammatter> WOW
[0:46:52] <%Solidnick18> kiwami
[0:46:57] <%MonsieurHedge> kiwami...
[0:46:58] <Dr_Mooose> just a scratch
[0:46:58] <%connos_livereview> apatBig Damage
[0:47:03] <+Grayhammatter> kiwami means EXTREME
[0:47:05] <Lindaru13> Muda muda muda muda
[0:47:07] <+aivalera> whoops gtg, my dad needs me. Gl with the stream!!
[0:47:08] <conflict1914> So are these fighting styles kind of like styles in DMC?
[0:47:08] <alexandrecau> like the yakuza dirtbag all get redeemable quality
[0:47:10] <$spardanwarrior> Ayy we back in Kamurocho!
[0:47:14] <dakuman13> kiwami means "Kiryu doesn't kill people"
[0:47:14] <%lewdskeletor13> Tis but a scratch
[0:47:19] <%zanzibar_junker> 3 and 6 were business men
[0:47:28] <ShichiNoBushi> Stomp him in the nuts.
[0:47:30] <%connos_livereview> not so apatBig Damage
[0:47:30] <alexandrecau> 2 were mostly koreans
[0:47:32] <LtSergei> thats a lot of health
[0:47:36] <lizard0tm> Pretty funny how real Yakuza think Kiryu's suit is fucking stupid
[0:47:38] <OhioNitsud> I'm such a scrub I didn't know you could speed up your attacks like that
[0:47:41] <dakuman13> I think the only reason kiryu never kills people is because they're so durable
[0:47:46] <alexandrecau> and this one is about a politician
[0:47:50] <YellowDays> i remember hating the health regen in this game
[0:48:08] <%MonsieurHedge> yakuza actually takes place in the distant past of RWBY, which explains why everyone is Anime Durable
[0:48:13] <Lindaru13> ooof
[0:48:14] <%ThatGuyfromMars> time to heal
[0:48:14] <%Solidnick18> ooooo
[0:48:16] <%Solidnick18> heal

[0:48:39] <KeiPrime> everywhar
[0:48:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Only took you like five heals
[0:48:39] <SilverFaustX> matana
[0:48:40] <%AbnormalVoid> Don't forget to deflect and break his poise!
[0:48:45] <natebud> Every time I tune in, he's just fighting majima
[0:48:46] <+mrcooperblack> my advice is to use god speed purely to dizzy your enemies with rush!
[0:48:46] <%Quentinmr> he knows what sex is dude
[0:48:47] <OhioNitsud> mmmm ground drink delicious
[0:48:47] <dakuman13> your social link has increased
[0:48:53] <alexandrecau> tiger drop takes way too long

[0:50:38] <%MonsieurHedge> hey chat gimme a new commander for edh that lets me steal people's shit
[0:50:39] <%Quentinmr> they're consumables
[0:50:40] <%lewdskeletor13> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:50:40] <%Solidnick18> counterrrrrrr
[0:50:47] <CastellanVon> I feel like that would hurt Kiryu WAY more than that guy
[0:50:50] <%Quentinmr> your blood is a consumable
[0:50:51] <DraxTD> DO IT PAT
[0:50:56] <Lindaru13> he's not K.O'd he's DEAD
[0:50:57] <%afronooch> DO IT
[0:50:59] <%tinyswampthing> that dudes fingers were fucked
[0:51:00] <+cvp5127> grind out some majima
[0:51:02] <ShichiNoBushi> Is Dragon Style even worth using at this point?
[0:51:04] <%Quentinmr> oxygen is a consumable
[0:51:06] <%AbnormalVoid> Amon is bullshit lol
[0:51:10] <%spiritofmojave> Yeah the sidequests in this are, eh, Kiwami 2 on the other hand
[0:51:14] <dakuman13> majima is an enemy type
[0:51:15] <+HellCopter> Fuck it Dude, let's go bowling
[0:51:17] <CastellanVon> If you Tiger Drop, Dragon Style is worth using. If not, no.
[0:51:19] <%El_Desperad0> YES FYM
[0:51:20] <+Dreek93> Amon is pretty boring anyway.
[0:51:26] <Zebroneath> Yeah, the sidequests in Kiwami aren't super exciting.
[0:51:31] <$SleepyMaribo> Dragon style cant even be fully upgraded till you beat the game
[0:51:32] <%zanzibar_junker> did you do the shorei pippi side story?
[0:51:38] <Lindaru13> sidequests in 0 were funny
[0:51:40] <+RushUnplugged> Tiger Drop is borderline cheating, it's a win button
[0:51:47] <xeros720> amon is a bs fight you need to bs back
[0:51:47] <%Quentinmr> we're all consumables
[0:51:52] <%Quentinmr> money is a consumable
[0:51:52] <mayorrev> ***
[0:51:52] <CastellanVon> You don't even need fully upgraded Dragon Style, just Tiger Drop.
[0:51:53] <takiyami> In both this and Zero, Dragon style just never gets the same passive buffs as the other styles. It's always inferior to Brawler.
[0:51:54] <starotter70> Honestly, the majima everywhere system makes this game for me
[0:51:57] <xanerts> Kiwami 2 is great
[0:51:59] <+misterfistor> oh hey, did pat just start streaming?
[0:52:00] <ShichiNoBushi> I miss the "Walking Erection" guy.
[0:52:04] <%spiritofmojave> I prefer Zero Dragon Style tbh

[0:52:15] <$SleepyMaribo> @AngriestPat its probably pocket Racer or the Taxi Cab

[1:06:53] <%spiritofmojave> Now do the dance
[1:06:53] <mrjohncarlton> Majima is such a good guy, letting Pat win like that
[1:06:55] <ShichiNoBushi> Now Kiryu does the dance.
[1:06:55] <+FoolsArcade> Majima threw the game
[1:06:58] <+Ell1ot> where's Nugget?
[1:06:58] <dekkitout> And now Kiryu does the dance
[1:07:01] <ancrest_tant> I would have a friend that would just palm the bowling ball like it was nerf ball. He was huge
[1:07:02] <%Remery_> No dancing :(
[1:07:04] <%these_pockets> Upon watching I realised something. I've no idea how bowling actually works
[1:07:05] <starotter70> Kiryu's great with balls
[1:07:06] <%Edgy_Macaroon> majima felt bad
[1:07:08] <SmarkyMC> learned bowling from an old friend jermaPluto
[1:07:09] <%Afterman_> lmao
[1:07:14] <+misterfistor> god IF ONLY
[1:07:16] <%spiritofmojave> if only
[1:07:17] <alexandrecau> Kiryu killed people with bowling balls
[1:07:18] <KeiPrime> kiryu wouldnt..
[1:07:20] <dakuman13> i wonder if the more you lose the majima the easier he gets
[1:07:20] <%AncelDeLambert> Kiryu did the Fortnite dance later
[1:07:21] <%Niney_Who> Overhead THrow YEYEYE
[1:07:23] <dekkitout> Can someone mod that, plz
[1:07:24] <KeiPrime> kiryu never killed anyone
[1:07:27] <%Luna_Ashford> Mod it in!
[1:07:27] <%konekoryugamine> Nah man, you get a strike in a fight
[1:07:27] <+misterfistor> Ichiban Kasuga would
[1:07:28] <%Ilpala> ESSENCEOF OVERHEADTHROW
[1:07:32] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat learned literal murder move
[1:07:33] <%TheSniperJoe> TheSniperJoe converted from a Twitch Prime sub to a Tier 1 sub! 
[1:07:35] <Fujiwara_92> KIRYU don't kills
[1:07:35] <natebud> Remember that time Kiryu bowled against that tiger?
[1:07:36] <%konekoryugamine> That sounded way more cool in my head
[1:07:37] <%Laecerelius> Main story?!
[1:07:37] <%korth367> someone probably modded kiryu doing the dance
[1:07:39] <starotter70> Yup
[1:07:40] <+Sulfur_Boride> I'm sure someone's already modded Kiryu doing the Libido dance in 0
[1:07:41] <xeros720> majima defeated
[1:07:41] <%these_pockets> Wait wait wait. It's ACTUALLY called the damned "Majima everywhere" system? For REAL? I thought that was a dumb joke.
[1:07:41] <ShichiNoBushi> Now call the alley and ask if they have 10-pound balls. Then when they say they do, ask how they are able to walk.
[1:07:42] <Chomperoo> hi mr man
[1:07:43] <$RubberFistFight> @these_pockets I used to be in a bowling club when I was a kid. It's surprisingly difficult to be a great bowler, but not too hard at all to be a GOOD one.
[1:07:50] <ScreamingMeat> @KeiPrime Remember that he sings Karaoke
[1:07:55] <%konekoryugamine> @these_pockets Apparently it's not a joke.
[1:07:56] <gustavozxd> honestly the original is still better
[1:08:01] <%Das_Bass> 2 is still the best game
[1:08:01] <%WackyXmand> yeah aside from a HD story there's not much here
[1:08:05] <Saiyza> I can't believe they're remaking Yakuza 4 already. I still remember when it was on the old SBF channel.
[1:08:10] <%Dr_DangerPhD> its insane the jump of quality from yakuza 1 to 2 even if you're just talking about the ps2 versions
[1:08:10] <%AncelDeLambert> I still haven't beaten 0. Burnt myself out on the real estate shit
[1:08:11] <Cardboard96> Kiwami 2 is basically yakuza 6
[1:08:11] <%Niney_Who> Isn't Essence of OVerhead Throw the Suplex?
[1:08:12] <%WackyXmand> and Majima everywhere system
[1:08:12] <SmarkyMC> kiryu has the god hand now?????
[1:08:13] <%konekoryugamine> Are they just STANDING there
[1:08:14] <starotter70> But Pocket Circuit Tho
[1:08:14] <%Fadedblank247> but pocket racing though
[1:08:16] <alcors_wisdom> having never played the original i really liked the side stuff
[1:08:16] <%konekoryugamine> MENACINGLY?!
[1:08:17] <Mr_Strut> GOTTA GO FAST
[1:08:18] <CastellanVon> fair
[1:08:20] <%PlainSimpleTailor> Why is the transition INTO a fight seamless, but the transition OUT isn't?
[1:08:21] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Fujiwara_92) (warning)
[1:08:22] <KeiPrime> those are a pocket dimension of songs
[1:08:26] <majindusto> 4 is NOT A REMAKE
[1:08:27] <+zaworldo> we using dragon style yet?
[1:08:27] <takiyami> Did that kick nock the sunglaasses off that guy's model?
[1:08:30] <%konekoryugamine> Beast.
[1:08:30] <alcors_wisdom> but im the kind of person who maxed out fishing in p5
[1:08:30] <+misterfistor> POCKET SIR
[1:08:36] <%MightyMaxT> Wasn't Kiwami also not a full priced game? Like it was 40 or 50 USD instead of 60?
[1:08:38] <%these_pockets> >It true ?I race
[1:08:38] <ScreamingMeat> Tunnel Snakes!? WutFace
[1:08:39] <majindusto> Its A REMASTER
[1:08:41] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You could always just look up a guide on which car sets to use for Pocket Racing
[1:08:42] <starotter70> You can't keep getting away!
[1:08:42] <Mr_Strut> Do the pocket racing you coward!
[1:08:43] <%konekoryugamine> @alcors_wisdom P5 had fishing?
[1:08:46] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL Kiryu just threw him by the air above his head
[1:08:51] <+misterfistor> @MightyMaxT it was 30
[1:08:51] <ShichiNoBushi> I can never see the point of competitive bowling. There is little interaction between the players, and they're just seeking who can get the higher score.
[1:08:52] <%Dr_DangerPhD> yeah it released at like $40
[1:08:53] <natebud> Everyone is blonde in the 90s
[1:08:55] <%manwithboxonhead> Pockets has returned.
[1:08:56] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat There's a substory in Debora that you should do though.

[1:13:54] <gustavozxd> i'm looking at this and thinking "yakuza kiwami/zero PVP would be absolutely awful"
[1:13:56] <CastellanVon> Kiwami would be a better game without the Kiwami system.
[1:13:57] <%spiritofmojave> This is that majong game everyone's talking about
[1:13:58] <Dr_Mooose> consumable noooo

[1:14:21] <alcors_wisdom> if you cant beat majima without healing then youre not ready for the final boss
[1:14:26] <dekkitout> I'm now visualizing seeing the city from a distance enveloping in a clash of a red and purple aura
[1:14:27] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat he is destroying yo butthole

[1:15:04] <danpc5> pocket racing give you permenant buff
[1:15:04] <Kaneis> @Lokito3o5 The Kiwami system is matching the stance while they're healing, you do bonus damage if you heat action them
[1:15:06] <starotter70> baby?

[1:18:57] <%waifoong98> Dead Souls stream when LUL
[1:18:57] <SilverFaustX> i got majima ptsd cause of this
[1:18:57] <$RubberFistFight> what the HELL is this game?
[1:18:58] <dekkitout> Zombima
[1:19:00] <%Slaardacity> NAIN?
[1:19:00] <%lewdskeletor13> HES EVERYWHERE
[1:19:04] <$RubberFistFight> first bowling, then laser shoes, now zombies?
[1:19:04] <mayorrev> DROPKICK
[1:19:05] <alexandrecau> pat there is like a whole passport sidequest before that
[1:19:05] <Saiyza> Majima is actually EVERYWHERE
[1:19:06] <DraxTD> just use Thriller @AngriestPat
[1:19:07] <ShichiNoBushi> Zombajima?
[1:19:08] <ScreamingMeat> ZOMJIMA!? WutFace
[1:19:19] <$RubberFistFight> use hokuto shinken on him
[1:19:21] <starotter70> Big counter battle
[1:19:25] <%rytyoung> NAAAAANIIII
[1:19:28] <dekkitout> Is Majima just Rolling Stone personified
[1:19:31] <mayorrev> big slaps
[1:19:33] <Cardboard96> He's actually the least annoying majima to fight
[1:19:33] <eldritchmoeblob> don't fall for it
[1:19:35] <%MonsieurHedge> majima is a red/black zombie for suuuure
[1:19:37] <Lindaru13> what the fck?!
[1:19:40] <Lindaru13> oooo
[1:19:44] <eldritchmoeblob> don't get caught up in HIS rhythm
[1:19:58] <%Solidnick18> lol
[1:19:58] <CastellanVon> Zombie Majima is easy since he has less health.
[1:20:17] <%ScudmanSentinel> Need to get the ability to change style while taking damage, so you just switch to rush and dash away
[1:20:21] <rubbishbinge> Majima necrodancing all over Pat
[1:20:28] <%Slaardacity> what buffs does he get from being a zombie?
[1:20:30] <Luesagna00> its cool they let him do heat moves
[1:20:36] <Lindaru13> oooo backhand
[1:20:38] <%Edgy_Macaroon> it is you get heat for dodge
[1:20:39] <%El_Desperad0> They're all good
[1:20:46] <wal__rus> the 3 hit brawler combo basically carried me through all the bosses on legendary
[1:21:06] <+mrcooperblack> why beast style when you can just avoid, evade, dizzy AND parry with rush style?
[1:21:09] <Saiyza> Why not style on him?
[1:21:12] <%Edgy_Macaroon> rush + dragon is best
[1:21:17] <Lokito3o5> Noice
[1:21:19] <OhioNitsud> I'd get back into walking dead if they had sick battles like this
[1:21:24] <gustavozxd> where's the royal guard style though
[1:21:25] <Chester_goes_Berserk> @slaardacity No buffs, he's a gentle thug majima in disguise
[1:21:27] <Cardboard96> My go to style is always beast tho
[1:21:27] <DracaenaLeaf> so close
[1:21:29] <CastellanVon> Kiwami system would be fine if the bosses didn't regain health so. damn. fast. If you heat moves are staled, the little time lag it takes to switch styles is enough to negate a staled Kiwami Heat move.
[1:21:30] <%Solidnick18> almost s
[1:21:34] <eldritchmoeblob> man do you remember the time majima was a zombie? the nerve of that guy
[1:21:37] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat is dragon style remotely useable in this game? or no
[1:21:37] <natebud> just one more pocket race
[1:22:01] <CastellanVon> If you're even halfway good at Tiger Drop, Dragon Style is the best in the game.
[1:22:04] <nobody12349> Did I type any gibberish recently, my cat walked all over my keyboard
[1:22:12] <OhioNitsud> rush to build meter, super with dragon
[1:22:17] <SilverFaustX> kiryu chan !!
[1:22:18] <dekkitout> Was- was that a shot of Kiryu dabbing?
[1:22:19] <%El_Desperad0> Np
[1:22:23] <%El_Desperad0> *No
[1:22:30] <+HellCopter> All you need is the speed up
[1:22:31] <circular7> including pocket racing
[1:22:36] <troxcree> Dragon is the best as soon as you get Tiger Drop.
[1:22:39] <%ScudmanSentinel> It honestly becomes usable when you get Tiger Drop, you just counter eevrything.
[1:22:40] <%El_Desperad0> Just do everything for Majima
[1:22:42] <starotter70> Especially Pocket Racing
[1:22:46] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat so what you're saying is. YOU HAVE TO POCKET RACE
[1:22:48] <KeiPrime> Mesu KING u bastard
[1:22:55] <lizard0tm> Kiryu dabs
[1:22:57] <VritraReiRei> D:
[1:22:59] <@commanderclaw> Do it, it's better than never finishing it
[1:23:01] <%trillmagical> it be like that
[1:23:01] <starotter70> That's fair
[1:23:02] <Darren716> Let's watch with the stream?
[1:23:03] <jotabranded> nooo D:
[1:23:04] <Luesagna00> so dragon style is great bet too stupidly nerfed?
[1:23:04] <ancrest_tant> It's after pocket racing and tiger drop
[1:23:08] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat would you plan on streaming Yakuza 3-5 remaster?
[1:23:08] <Dest_121> you still haven't beat it?
[1:23:10] <natebud> No but do more idol minigames thugh
[1:23:11] <TheBlankAce> That's probably for the best in your case
[1:23:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> JUST DO iT AND START 6
[1:23:11] <+Grayhammatter> do it, so you can play 6
[1:23:12] <%Solidnick18> oh nooo
[1:23:12] <%spiritofmojave> Long we watch it like a movie here, that'd be cool
[1:23:14] <%afronooch> same
[1:23:14] <Darren716> Could you stream the cut scenes on here?
[1:23:16] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat the ps4 version is coming soon
[1:23:16] <Kaneis> 3/4/5 are getting remasters right? Just not 'Kiwami' style stuff
[1:23:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> just watch your playthrough on SBFP dude
[1:23:20] <%ElenaManetta> You don't have one of those GAMER MAN CAVES where it's like, every single fucking console ever made hooked up in some elaborate setup
[1:23:21] <majindusto> DONT PAT...JUST FUCKING PLAY 5 YOU COWARD
[1:23:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Do it so you can stream 6
[1:23:23] <%El_Desperad0> Did you play 4 or 5?
[1:23:23] <wal__rus> 6 is so good
[1:23:24] <+crdy93> Yeah but you should just play through 5. It's REALLY good.
[1:23:25] <%waifoong98> Just play all the games at once Kappa
[1:23:26] <+코코꾸라> Just watch 5, really
[1:23:26] <purpstank> @purpstank is new here. Say hello! VoHiYo
[1:23:28] <takiyami> I think 6 has a recap cutscene tho
[1:23:29] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat you can do that, but ONLY if you stream you watching it
[1:23:31] <%flagi64> @angriestpat can we do a let's watch on twitch?
[1:23:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> watch on stream so we can watch too
[1:23:38] <hussdogrob> stream your cutscene binge
[1:23:39] <CastellanVon> All you need is Tiger Drop. Which you have to grind the tournaments and do Komaki fights. Tournaments aren't bad but there's a Komaki fight where you have to fight Majima with just Dragon Style and it's the fucking worst.
[1:23:39] <DougintheTrench> Still wish the PS4 could play PS3 games. If only it could run the hardware!
[1:23:39] <Admiral_PopnFresh> but be an idol, pat!
[1:23:40] <Saiyza> 5 really isn't the best Yakuza to start on. It's not bad, though.
[1:23:40] <%Das_Bass> @AngriestPat 6 has a recap for the ending of 5
[1:23:41] <xeros720> get yak6 and watch yak5 the movie
[1:23:44] <wal__rus> 6 has a small recap of every game but its nowhere near all cutscenes
[1:23:44] <eldritchmoeblob> @purpstank hello
[1:23:48] <DougintheTrench> @purpstank Hey there and welcome!
[1:23:49] <%afronooch> combo stream 3/4 with woolie then 5 with slowbeef EZ
[1:23:50] <VanLynx> @AngriestPat do the cutscenes also include the mini QTE's in the fights?
[1:23:50] <+Jajanken4> when is it getting western releases =(
[1:23:50] <%spiritofmojave> 6 is excellent, only thing bogging it down is the hardware imo. Hope it comes to PC one day
[1:23:54] <+misterfistor> 5 is fun though. BEAR HUNTING
[1:23:57] <Dest_121> yakuza 6 shows the ending for 5
[1:23:59] <suikudo> @AngriestPat Do a lets watch with Plague and Peach
[1:24:00] <%Solidnick18> the idol stuff slows the game down
[1:24:11] <KeiPrime> to play mesu King thats why
[1:24:13] <+misterfistor> Akiyama DANCE
[1:24:15] <%Solidnick18> yakuza 5 has a really good ending tho
[1:24:15] <wal__rus> no like theres a recap movie thing for every yakuza game up until that point
[1:24:16] <official_nakmatic> Which Yakuza game should I start out with? Never played an entry before. VoHiYo
[1:24:16] <alexandrecau> Kiryu sucks at black market
[1:24:16] <%rytyoung> ELMA?
[1:24:19] <NotHereToStream> you need to get a pass into shangri la and she has it?
[1:24:19] <%Remery_> Lewd?
[1:24:20] <gustavozxd> bag?
[1:24:23] <dekkitout> Why....is it.....cold....
[1:24:27] <majindusto> JUST FUCKING PLAY 5
[1:24:29] <Blank9> yakuza 5's ending is strong
[1:24:29] <gustavozxd> are you touching elmo's nuts?
[1:24:32] <%MonsieurHedge> there's really no difference between going to a hostess club and holding your cat's bag
[1:24:32] <natebud> I tapped out on 3, Okinawa was a little too uneventful.
[1:24:32] <%lewdskeletor13> @official_nakmatic Start with Zero for sure
[1:24:37] <%afronooch> @official_nakmatic start with 0
[1:24:44] <%ElenaManetta> you were bowling for so long you forgot about the plot
[1:24:44] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @MonsieurHedge well, there's one
[1:24:56] <xeros720> should his bag be wet and cold like a dog's nose?
[1:24:59] <+BaekTheHeck> elmo is the real star here
[1:25:04] <GundamF91> 6 is pretty great, I just thought it was an odd storyline to send Kiryu out on tbh
[1:25:08] <%castcode> this music tho
[1:25:12] <%ElenaManetta> what is WRONG with this lady's fucking face
[1:25:13] <%Spydurman> LUL
[1:25:15] <alexandrecau> immigration the worst thing in Japan
[1:25:17] <+cvp5127> damn
[1:25:18] <%spiritofmojave> Jesus christ
[1:25:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @MonsieurHedge when you go to a hostess club, you hold a woman's bag, but if you stay at home, you hold your cat's bag
[1:25:20] <%MagickBurritoh> no emotion on her face
[1:25:21] <+Grayhammatter> problem solved LUL
[1:25:23] <VritraReiRei> DAMMIT PAT LUL
[1:25:27] <+SoriduSnaku> Yakuza 0 was so good probably my favourite in the series
[1:25:35] <+misterfistor> 6 was great, i just wish as an ender for Kiryu's storyline, more Yakuza characters besides Haruka showed up through most of the story :c
[1:25:39] <$HentaiSenpai9K> OH my god PATRICK
[1:25:39] <%MonsieurHedge> @alexandrecau im gonna go with the war crimes denial instead
[1:25:40] <%ElenaManetta> She looks like she's missing a texture pass
[1:25:42] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Big lips, small eyes, not a good combo
[1:25:44] <%Spydurman> Pat "You think your dad hit you hard" Boivon ladies and gents
[1:25:44] <%MagickBurritoh> she is a robot
[1:25:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> 0 was great because of nugget
[1:25:45] <+burritocheetos> Deport Elmo
[1:25:47] <Blank9> ishin is probably the best game in the series
[1:25:47] <ScreamingMeat> Americat
[1:25:51] <%these_pockets> I saw "Shadow Mewtwo" in the emotes and looked it up and it's real. And man, that's the first pokemon I missed entirely basically. I am officially aging as of right now.
[1:25:51] <stabbityrabbit> With the Majima everywhere system I expect him to bust in on literally every cutscene.
[1:25:58] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ELMERICA
[1:26:01] <%rumtumtugnutz> Elmoo
[1:26:07] <natebud> What's the percentage of funny side missions compared to 0?
[1:26:12] <alexandrecau> denying is one thing, still being a dick to immigrant is another
[1:26:12] <+BaekTheHeck> god elmo is so cute
[1:26:14] <%ElenaManetta> Does Elmo even miss Paige. Does he even know she's gone
[1:26:24] <%Quentinmr> can we get an emlo instagram
[1:26:24] <gustavozxd> @natebud they're all the exact same joke in kiwami
[1:26:29] <%lewdskeletor13> Does Elmo miss his mother
[1:26:35] <%ElenaManetta> God Bless Japan
[1:26:36] <+HeadsHeldHigh> LOL
[1:26:39] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:26:42] <FirewallStorm> its true
[1:26:42] <+misterfistor> China is pretty awful. Don't they only allow one child?
[1:26:43] <%king_wragles> It's not exactly hidden......
[1:26:44] <ChoculaUltra> you've yeed your last haw, Pat.
[1:26:45] <Dr_Mooose> southern Japan
[1:26:45] <%cherubs_anonymous> It kinda is though
[1:26:46] <theshillman> i mean, china can be a pretty harsh place
[1:26:47] <%AbnormalVoid> Chinese are just southern Japanese
[1:26:48] <panic_rabbit> to be fair it's true
[1:26:48] <%spiritofmojave> it's not hidden at all
[1:26:48] <Mr_Strut> Well she's not wrong
[1:26:50] <%AbnormalVoid> Kappa
[1:26:50] <alexandrecau> two children
[1:26:50] <%Naho_Saenoki> @stabbityrabbit If he was somewhere in the background of every cutscene, just doing his dance, it'd be the BEST.
[1:26:52] <ScreamingMeat> China does kinda suck tho
[1:26:53] <%lewdskeletor13> This series REALLY hates China and Korea
[1:26:53] <+Grayhammatter> well YEE my HAW
[1:26:53] <%these_pockets> Every country belongs to America
[1:26:55] <%ElenaManetta> China doesn't have FREEDOM like JAPAN
[1:26:59] <%waifoong98> who would want to live in China tho...
[1:26:59] <%Deekman> China where Alphys is from
[1:26:59] <BeagleCypher> China is really bad
[1:27:00] <%Das_Bass> 1989 tiananmen square
[1:27:01] <+misterfistor> oh 2 kids. aight
[1:27:01] <TheBlankAce> Tapping into the plague energy

[1:27:05] <dekkitout> Southern Dame Pat?
[1:27:06] <rosemon5001> they do have actual whore house thou
[1:27:08] <%El_Desperad0> Wasn't China a shit show during the early 2000's?
[1:27:08] <NotHereToStream> mention pooh bear in china and you will probably disappear
[1:27:09] <%AbnormalVoid> I mean, not being under the boot of communism is probably nice
[1:27:11] <natebud> @gustavozxd must be a pretty good joke then...
[1:27:11] <+miguelrod777> as a weeb clearly japan is better
[1:27:12] <theshillman> the rampant corruption, pollution
[1:27:14] <%zanzibar_junker> They allow more than one kid but there's taxes involved
[1:27:19] <roflwaffleauthoritah> china is an awful totalitarian nightmare tbf
[1:27:23] <%MonsieurHedge> i mean japanese nationalism is a Big Deal
[1:27:23] <official_nakmatic> China is kinda bad. My chinese friends can confirm.

[1:27:26] <mayorrev> SMOKING KILLS

[1:27:39] <+misterfistor> oh god. god no pat. almost every other Yakuza you meet is a scumbag

[1:27:49] <%zanzibar_junker> also no gay fiction in china now
[1:27:49] <%SaltyDongs> Nugget attacks
[1:27:50] <+Mittensbro> China is basically a dystopian hellscape tho
[1:27:51] <candidateplays> The Yakuza stuff is insane, but I would much rather live in Japan than China.
[1:27:55] <%Omegaanimus> even the Yakuza movie was harsh on Koreans
[1:27:58] <ScreamingMeat> Necks Broken
[1:27:58] <official_nakmatic> America's kinda bad too.
[1:27:59] <OhioNitsud> and Chinese are the worst
[1:27:59] <%Das_Bass> isnt it illegal to be gay in China
[1:28:00] <mayorrev> This game does not promote SMOKING or the use of CIGARETTES
[1:28:00] <%lewdskeletor13> REMEMBER THE CHINESE FRANKENSTEIN IN ZERO? I sure do
[1:28:02] <Seitine> But it's only a cigar when it's in my mouth, everyone else likes sucking cock.

[1:28:05] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Man that kick is great lol
[1:28:09] <london_flexing> China is ok if your
[1:28:14] <fruit_pie_the_magician> To be fair, most of the yakuza in these games are enormous assholes, and most of the problems stem from corrupt government officials
[1:28:18] <%BobaFetish2124> seen*
[1:28:22] <%spiritofmojave> To be fair China does some shitty things, taking a course on their fuckery in Taiwan
[1:28:23] <rubbishbinge> As a Chinese guy who lives in China, I'm feeling a bit vindicated here.
[1:28:26] <Captain_Joe1911> notekMilk CurseLit
[1:28:27] <mrjohncarlton> Come to think of it All the "Good Yakuza" are out of the family when you play as them aren't they?
[1:28:29] <alexandrecau> The dirt bag yakuza get a sad song when they die, the chinese just burn alive
[1:28:29] <ScreamingMeat> @london_flexing If you're what?
[1:28:30] <Captain_Joe1911> atpMunchies CurseLit
[1:28:33] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat don't all the yakuza games depict like 80% of the yakuzas as huge dirtbags?
[1:28:37] <natebud> Has kiryu killed that innocent waiter yet?
[1:28:37] <Chester_goes_Berserk> Japanese criminals are better than foreign criminals seems to be the logic
[1:28:44] <%BobaFetish2124> weeb*
[1:28:47] <rosemon5001> @AngriestPat more like you liberated them from their mortal coils
[1:28:54] <roflwaffleauthoritah> China has literal concentration camps also
[1:28:55] <%ElenaManetta> Is going YEAH I LOVE THE YAKUZA any more different than America going FUCK YEAH GANGSTERS ?
[1:29:02] <+misterfistor> :O
[1:29:06] <KeiPrime> kiryu is the ideal
[1:29:08] <%ElenaManetta> And I mean Tommy Gun gangsters
[1:29:14] <%AbnormalVoid> LUL
[1:29:18] <ShichiNoBushi> Those are the villain yakuza.
[1:29:18] <%Spydurman> murder . . . for the people
[1:29:20] <+misterfistor> and also promoting being a Virgin
[1:29:20] <alexandrecau> @mrjohncarlton fuck no, the hirose family, kashiwagi and Daigo are active and nice
[1:29:20] <pmtriox> community crime is best crime
[1:29:20] <SomersaultJustice> I'm not like other Yakuza, says other Yakuza
[1:29:21] <london_flexing> Middle or high ckass and not about fucking with the gov
[1:29:22] <%spiritofmojave> There's always a Kiryu in the Yakuza is the message, surely very realistic
[1:29:23] <%afronooch> I wanna be GANG STAR
[1:29:24] <%Kirby_Sauce> Remember "le forge" from ned's declassified?
[1:29:25] <hntronium> you could say crimemunnity
[1:29:26] <%Das_Bass> real yakuza has never been tried
[1:29:28] <%MonsieurHedge> alright i have a question: what does red bull actually TASTE LIKE? regular monster tastes like ass, but the orange one is pretty good
[1:29:30] <bleugh> bureikingu za raaaw
[1:29:32] <ChoculaUltra> if there's anything I learned about Yakuza from the games, it's that if you don't like something in the Yakuza you have to combo your way to fixing it.
[1:29:36] <+Flambage> Traditional Yakuza are the heroes
[1:29:37] <HollowMan190> what dose that even mean?
[1:29:38] <gustavozxd> good vibes crime
[1:29:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> And their always not as bad as Chinese and Korean mafias
[1:29:41] <official_nakmatic> @ElenaManetta That sounds like a manga series
[1:29:42] <%Naho_Saenoki> @AngriestPat Putting the Yakuza in a negative light has gotten a few movie directors actually murdered in Japan in the past.
[1:29:43] <Luesagna00> my nindo my ninja..i mean yakuza way dattebiyo!
[1:29:46] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:29:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The "true yakuza way" is a bunch of shit nobody follows though, its a front
[1:29:46] <alexandrecau> Like kiryu praises shimano and Dojima in 2 as strong leaders
[1:29:48] <%Spydurman> sexy times
[1:29:48] <+ArcLifth> Isn't it just saying kiryu is a huge idealist for yakuza stuff
[1:29:50] <hntronium> crimmunity
[1:29:57] <%drabberfaun535> I would like to point out that the yakuza was infact founded on the idea of doing crime for the greater good of the cfommunity
[1:29:59] <natebud> Mama really slimmed down since 0.

[1:33:13] <%lewdskeletor13> @elenamanetta Yeah but they’re not portrayed in an honorable light
[1:33:15] <danknugglit> Are these pirates? LUL
[1:33:18] <+zaworldo> finally
[1:33:18] <natebud> @Admiral_PopnFresh yeah, remember the bartender mama from 0?
[1:33:19] <alexandrecau> honorless chinese swords
[1:33:20] <+zaworldo> FINALLY
[1:33:22] <+zaworldo> IT HAPPENED
[1:33:25] <+Grayhammatter> NANI?
[1:33:25] <%Quentinmr> C U R V E D S W O R D S
[1:33:28] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Someone actually recognizes Kiryu
[1:33:34] <+zaworldo> SOMEONE RECOGNIZED KIRYU
[1:33:36] <%afronooch> is it SKI-mitar or SCY-mitar?
[1:33:36] <MarylandJutsu> BIG FIGHTS
[1:33:36] <+HeadsHeldHigh> And it's triad no less
[1:33:36] <%lewdskeletor13> IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
[1:33:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @natebud I don't actually
[1:33:37] <%hawk_rush> is this dark souls??
[1:33:39] <+zaworldo> FIGHTING ANYWAYS
[1:33:43] <%AncelDeLambert> how has no-one called the cops
[1:33:43] <+ChrisAlgoo> kiryu is fuckin dead
[1:33:43] <$RubberFistFight> those swords are impractically large
[1:33:46] <+Grayhammatter> air licks
[1:33:46] <%spiritofmojave> The whole 'why the fuck are they using swords' thing is REALLY stupid in Y6
[1:33:46] <ChoculaUltra> do you think they intentionally all matched daos or do you think they all just grabbed a weapon on the way out
[1:33:47] <%ElenaManetta> They are portrayed as people instead of just one-sided monsters, so it is giving a dimension to someone who is essentially an organized killer
[1:33:49] <Seitine> MY GOD those swords are C U R V E D
[1:33:50] <gustavozxd> Kiryu's voice is the absolute best thing ever
[1:33:53] <MarylandJutsu> ELMO is being BIG AND STRONG
[1:33:54] <%BigNerdSam> @alexandrecau Pat is clearly a piss man instead of a snowman

[1:34:08] <Daniel_Is_I> It's okay, they're only icon scimmys,not rune.
[1:34:09] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> God, Beast Style is so GODDAMN COOL
[1:34:10] <Conky89> I would say to never bring fists to a sword fight but...
[1:34:11] <Daniel_Is_I> iron*
[1:34:11] <GundamF91> Oh Yeah, Kiryu like obliterated the Snake Flower Triad didn't he
[1:34:12] <natebud> @Admiral_PopnFresh it was the okam bar near shellac
[1:34:14] <alexandrecau> @BigNerdSam sometime snow is pissed on
[1:34:14] <$RubberFistFight> @AncelDeLambert he has the power of protagonist on his side.
[1:34:19] <MarylandJutsu> Beast Mode is a WALKING TANK
[1:34:21] <ScreamingMeat> @afronooch SCY-mitar, but these are called Dao

[1:34:34] <%MonsieurHedge> that guy is dead
[1:34:34] <pmtriox> these triads are so rich they're using antique swords
[1:34:36] <%AncelDeLambert> Man, Kiryus fists should not even close anymore, they should just be lumps of bone

[1:34:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> @natebud Ah, well ok then, I appreciate the context
[1:35:00] <alrobot2014> merry christmas to this man
[1:35:02] <%Naho_Saenoki> Kiryu's voice actor has his own band, and they're actually really good.
[1:35:05] <mayorrev> did he just dislocate both of that guy's arms? @AngriestPat
[1:35:08] <$RubberFistFight> dude if you hit someone hard enough with a bottle to shatter it like that, they are NEVER getting back up.

[1:35:27] <ChoculaUltra> do any of the Yakuza games have dismemberment? I feel like they would.
[1:35:30] <%thelonechris> apatBig
[1:35:31] <%ElenaManetta> She gave him an ocular pat down
[1:35:32] <%BigNerdSam> Shit, @angriestpat missed the rawest heat move with those swords.
[1:35:33] <T_Sasquatch> people understimate how hard it is to break a bottle over a persons head
[1:35:34] <%skizzuto> Elmo is dummy thicc
[1:35:34] <DracaenaLeaf> y u ruin it
[1:35:36] <rubbishbinge> This was all a test
[1:35:39] <ScreamingMeat> You ruined it
[1:35:40] <shoobieredgrave> Kiryu's VA actually looks cooler than Kiryu irl.
[1:35:45] <MarylandJutsu> @ElenaManetta wouldn't we all do that
[1:35:47] <%MagickBurritoh> MASAKA

[1:36:05] <$RubberFistFight> @T_Sasquatch it's practically impossible with a BEER bottle. Trying it with wine bottle would kill the person before you got even close.
[1:36:10] <pimpinahz> bakana
[1:36:13] <derekwst3> Elmo butt
[1:36:16] <%Naho_Saenoki> @shoobieredgrave You are super right.

[1:36:51] <MarylandJutsu> Elmo Big and Strong System
[1:36:53] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Bicycle (CREAM)
[1:36:59] <natebud> Does majima actually have a real purpose in the story beyond just existing?
[1:36:59] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Kiryu Smash! BabyRage
[1:37:00] <Luesagna00> dance style seems reeeaaal annoying to handle
[1:37:01] <@commanderclaw> Use the electrical thing
[1:37:11] <official_nakmatic> So is Yakauza's combat like a character action game (dmc, bayo, god hand, etc.)
[1:37:13] <$RubberFistFight> @natebud who else is gonna have laser shoes?
[1:37:15] <%afronooch> @natebud in 1, not so muc

[1:37:22] <%AbnormalVoid> yes
[1:37:28] <+TheBeastman1122> Eddy Gordo
[1:37:28] <+misterfistor> like 3 times
[1:37:28] <%Reizie_Etherealm> HEEEEEYA!
[1:37:44] <+Ell1ot> how come Majima doesn't, "YAHOO!" like in the other game?
[1:37:44] <%spiritofmojave> and is Mark Hamil
[1:37:51] <stabbityrabbit> I choose to believe Majima was listening in on the whole cutscene, and then jumped in a trash-can really quick so he could jump you.
[1:37:56] <MarylandJutsu> Majima was voiced by Mark Hamill at one time
[1:38:00] <+Story_Ark> what order do you play the yakuzies?
[1:38:02] <shoobieredgrave> He almost has a Arkham/Jester thing going on now hes so inconsistent
[1:38:04] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Doesn't she kidnap Haruka?
[1:38:07] <%El_Desperad0> Mark Hamil was not good as Majima
[1:38:10] <pimpinahz> majikayo
[1:38:14] <%Das_Bass> play in number order
[1:38:17] <MarylandJutsu> @Story_Ark 0 -> Kiwami -> Kiwami 2
[1:38:19] <+icekept> heal
[1:38:20] <%Das_Bass> 0-6
[1:38:21] <$RubberFistFight> @stabbityrabbit he's like the Chief in Inspector Gadget. Always showing up in bins and post boxes and bushes and whatnot.
[1:38:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @El_Desperad0 HERESY!
[1:38:40] <Rhinoprotoss> Use the plate
[1:38:42] <3xgilly> eat the plate
[1:38:45] <%Das_Bass> play dead souls if you like pain
[1:38:47] <+misterfistor> OOOWWWAAAGH
[1:38:47] <T_Sasquatch> majima is basically the joker but self aware of his actions
[1:38:48] <pimpinahz> Konoyaro
[1:38:51] <+ChrisAlgoo> this is some devil may cry 1 ass music
[1:39:00] <silverira> KISAMA
[1:39:05] <+Chewygamer> ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
[1:39:06] <DraxTD> ORA ORA ORA
[1:39:06] <shoobieredgrave> GODSPEED BITCHES
[1:39:06] <%bread_assassin> Majima didn; become a fan favorite until later in the series, and the devs realized that he needed to be in more than like two scenes, like he was in the original.
[1:39:11] <shaneok64> EXTREME
[1:39:12] <alexandrecau> Come on
[1:39:15] <$RubberFistFight> [SHINOBI EXECUTION]
[1:39:17] <DougintheTrench> Man, these bosses have WAY too much health.
[1:39:18] <%hawk_rush> ORA ORA ORA ORA
[1:39:19] <+cha0tic_klutch> Yare yare daze
[1:39:21] <madogod> why am i watching this? spoilers for me. also is majjima a baddy now?
[1:39:25] <T_Sasquatch> there are many times when majima suddenly gets super serious and wise
[1:39:27] <+misterfistor> he became a fan favorite in 2 when they expanded on his character a lot more
[1:39:31] <pimpinahz> jamada
[1:39:33] <Conky89> Majima rockin that break dance fight style
[1:39:37] <shoobieredgrave> @DougintheTrench not if you fuck them up right
[1:39:46] <alexandrecau> @madogod majima always was a baddy, sort of
[1:39:47] <Daxalog> HEAT go DOWN.
[1:39:52] <%spiritofmojave> the amount of color grades for the health bars is insane for his last couple fights
[1:40:00] <RetributionP> kiwame means repetitive
[1:40:01] <%afronooch> @madogod he's more vegeta to Kiryus goku
[1:40:01] <+cha0tic_klutch> Break dancing increases his STANDO POWAH
[1:40:06] <%Mekhet09> Yeah you are going to not enjoy that.
[1:40:14] <%Mekhet09> His knife style is even worse.
[1:40:23] <%spiritofmojave> knife style was oof
[1:40:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cha0tic_klutch Stands? The hell are those! THIS IS THE RIPPLE!
[1:40:49] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat Doesn't Brawler style have a counter move?
[1:40:58] <DraxTD> krunkOra krunkOra krunkOra
[1:41:03] <shoobieredgrave> why not just spam godspeed? AI can't handle it.
[1:41:10] <+BaekTheHeck> did he just juggle majima dmc style
[1:41:15] <natebud> The plan is to put so much Majima in one game that you get sick of him.
[1:41:16] <pimpinahz> lol
[1:41:17] <Daxalog> Uh oh
[1:41:23] <ooblag> It does, but it's not great
[1:41:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> No Majima is definitely Goku to Kiryu's Goku
[1:41:29] <%hawk_rush> imma read some slam dunk, see you guys
[1:41:30] <alexandrecau> you can't spam godspeed
[1:41:30] <+misterfistor> woof
[1:41:33] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 I feel like the everywhere system lessens the impact of fighting him due to sheer volume of said fights. I mean, could they dial back the Neegan fights just a little bit?
[1:41:34] <+misterfistor> nevermind then
[1:41:35] <takiyami> Tiger Drop his ass into the milky way
[1:41:38] <%spiritofmojave> it's never fast enough to parry in time
[1:41:38] <EuropantLamprey> Is that guy just using the Spin?
[1:41:39] <alexandrecau> you need like full bar
[1:41:40] <+funnyfunnykid> I feel like Kiwami started making the special moves look like some anime nonsense
[1:41:41] <+lucaflow> This majima everywhere system seems kinda obnoxious
[1:41:52] <%Naho_Saenoki> @takiyami (Milky Way!)
[1:41:53] <DougintheTrench> @shoobieredgrave Yeah, the clothesline move that Beast has proper eff's stuff up. But that does mean that these bosses fights can't be a bit tedious with all the health. I'd rather they just hit harder so I have to worry 'bout my life than a boss that has 3 health bars that half the screen wide.
[1:41:59] <ooblag> I'm telling you though, the half hour of grind for Tiger Drop will save you HOURS of frustration
[1:42:02] <alexandrecau> Yakuza 3 made those anime stupid
[1:42:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> @funnyfunnykid It was nonsense far before iwami
[1:42:16] <EuropantLamprey> Killed him by phasing your hand into his dick
[1:42:17] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:42:17] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @EuropantLamprey Why, it's clearly his stand, 「Who Let the Dogs Out」
[1:42:18] <+misterfistor> the Majima everywhere system gets casual when you get Tiger Drop and take off 2 healthbars each hit
[1:42:21] <+zaworldo> @AngriestPat just go grind for tiger drop PLEASE it makes shit so much easier
[1:42:29] <natebud> Lets see that magic pixel
[1:42:34] <%Mekhet09> Yeah tigerdrops is important.

[1:43:23] <+funnyfunnykid> @a_mad_dragon yeah but it was like a schlocky live action film level of nonsense, now we got Fist of the North Star punches

[1:43:23] <ooblag> Now we HAVE to tell you to grind Tiger Drop

[1:43:45] <DomunDomunDomun> But what if you need tiger drop later?
[1:43:47] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat You have a counter in Beast actually. If you dodge and then hit O/B towards the enemy he does a big throw
[1:44:07] <%BigNerdSam> Use all 13 of Kiryu's weapon slots!
[1:44:07] <%Niney_Who> It's the Cyclone Throw if you wanna look at it

[1:44:11] <+biodomewithpaulyshor> Tiger Drop entirely breaks the game and makes every encounter piss easy
[1:44:16] <%Niney_Who> It was good for fighting Shakedowns in 0
[1:44:16] <OhioNitsud> Pat is actively king crimsoning tiger drop
[1:44:17] <PerrinIsDead> He misses peach
[1:44:19] <%Mekhet09> It's going to be fun watching it.
[1:44:20] <pimpinahz> Pat did you here that?? KIRIYU-CHAN

[1:45:12] <%trillmagical> he fucked up the bit
[1:45:15] <ScreamingMeat> What's so bad about Pocket Racing?
[1:45:15] <troxcree> You just need the coliseum for tiger drop though.
[1:45:17] <shoobieredgrave> Pocket racing is the fucking worse while also the fucking coolest but its mostly the fucking worse
[1:45:19] <%patricksly36> Or... and hear me out here... you grind poket racing
[1:45:21] <%spiritofmojave> @Kirby_Sauce ya missed pal
[1:45:23] <KeiPrime> Coward running from the sexy bug game
[1:45:24] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you don't need to max it out
[1:45:25] <dekkitout> Mesu and racing? Yeah, I'd hard pass too.
[1:45:26] <%Mekhet09> It's coliseum pat.

[1:45:33] <KeiPrime> its literally possible to max it
[1:45:34] <Rhinoprotoss> ????
[1:45:35] <CastellanVon> You just need to do Tournament and Komaki for Tiger Drop. Not MesuKing or Pocket Racing.
[1:45:35] <%ECRead> Mesu King is about friendship
[1:45:35] <$RubberFistFight> @spiritofmojave it's all he knows how to do Kappa
[1:45:36] <%Quentinmr> YOU CAN
[1:45:38] <+zaworldo> YOU ACTUALLY CAN
[1:45:38] <ChaosDDT> Tiger Drop is only Komaki trainingg only
[1:45:39] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh Pat
[1:45:39] <%Quentinmr> IT'S NOT A CONSUMABLE
[1:45:42] <+misterfistor> arigato naaaa
[1:45:43] <Desertfishing> but you can
[1:45:44] <+zaworldo> BUT YOU CAN
[1:45:44] <ancrest_tant> The mesu king one is actually pretty easy
[1:45:45] <natebud> Coliseum is a sometimes thing
[1:45:49] <Rhinoprotoss> Styles are consumable
[1:45:49] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you can tho
[1:45:50] <+HeadsHeldHigh> ??
[1:45:51] <%spiritofmojave> @RubberFistFight sugoiSmugsnake
[1:45:51] <KeiPrime> you stubborn FOOL
[1:45:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Remember that time Majima invented the sales tax?
[1:45:53] <+zaworldo> JUST DO POCKET RACING
[1:45:53] <%Laecerelius> You got enough CP to get anything good?
[1:45:53] <Fujiwara_92> he won't max it out cause pocket racing gjys
[1:45:54] <%Kirby_Sauce> cheer500 yeah pat, you're right, these two charismatic, insane sociopaths with a fondness for bats, knives, and fashon accessories, who take massive pride in their work (all instances of work being fun and violence) have NOTHING in common
[1:45:54] <VanLynx> I mean it's not pointless but I get it
[1:45:58] <Mr_Strut> So do pocket racing
[1:45:59] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat you can max it out tho, just play Pocket Racing and Mesuking!
[1:45:59] <PerrinIsDead> Gobolins
[1:46:00] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat the devs decided that dragon style is too good so the grind for it is stupid?
[1:46:00] <@commanderclaw> Just use the cheat sheet
[1:46:04] <%El_Desperad0> All you need to do is Komaki, Pat
[1:46:06] <+misterfistor> MONEY TI- oh
[1:46:08] <%Edgy_Macaroon> they are easy
[1:46:09] <%rumtumtugnutz> Go get the girl at the hostess club that like girls to crank your hog
[1:46:10] <%WackyXmand> that's about where i am with Sekiro. The All Skills trophy is a bitch to grind for
[1:46:10] <%Solidnick18> mesu king is great
[1:46:10] <dekkitout> You sound kinda peeved/bummed about it though
[1:46:10] <%Mekhet09> That's only for majima not tiger drop.
[1:46:13] <NotHereToStream> you don't need to do pocket racing or mesuking for tigerdrop, its all Colosseum
[1:46:14] <SilverFaustX> boo
[1:46:17] <troxcree> Mesu King and Pocket racing aren't involved in the Komaki skills.
[1:46:17] <%Sasquatch_John> @AngriestPat You don't need to do pocket racing to get Dragon Style, you just need to do majima and the coliseum
[1:46:18] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Play pocket mesu
[1:46:18] <%Solidnick18> booo
[1:46:23] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Pure cowardice

[1:46:34] <%Afterman_> could just cheat offscreen for it
[1:46:34] <T_Sasquatch> honestly i didnt bother with pocket racing
[1:46:35] <@commanderclaw> But MesuKing gives us the anime tiddies we deserve
[1:46:36] <%Solidnick18> mesu king has sexy ladies
[1:46:36] <%Mekhet09> This majima fight is going to be fun.
[1:46:36] <+HeadsHeldHigh> fake gamer alert

[1:46:53] <%Das_Bass> f a k e f a n
[1:46:54] <+zaworldo> his goblins are showing up again
[1:46:55] <natebud> That makes no sense whatsoever
[1:46:58] <%Quentinmr> it's the goblins
[1:46:58] <%El_Desperad0> wow
[1:47:00] <%chaumiester> wtf is Mesu King?

[1:47:07] <prime_name> Then why even do the Majima fights?
[1:47:07] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@RadSuit) (warning)

[1:47:12] <%Solidnick18> majima taxi
[1:47:13] <lizard0tm> How does Kiryu not notice
[1:47:14] <rubbishbinge> Pat Needs To Respect His Viewers And Show Big Anime Tiddies
[1:47:15] <+zaworldo> guys it's the goblins
[1:47:20] <+zaworldo> we can't convince him
[1:47:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Did Kiryu not notice it was Majima LUL
[1:47:24] <%Edgy_Macaroon> mad dog
[1:47:24] <Them00n> tHAT MAKES NO SENSE
[1:47:26] <Luesagna00> but u need to save dragon style for later!
[1:47:27] <natebud> You should be ashamed of yourself.
[1:47:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> Somebody should mod this game to add Gangnam Style
[1:47:30] <%Gogogolem> Also Majima is the best.
[1:47:32] <ooblag> "Yakuza Kiwami Needs a No PocketRacer/MesuKing Mode, and Here's Why"
[1:47:32] <%Solidnick18> oh my...
[1:47:38] <%MisterTylerrr> @Them00n He knows
[1:47:41] <$RubberFistFight> @zaworldo or maybe he just doesn't want to do it because it's not fun for him?
[1:47:44] <+DukeMoose> why would you avoid Majima even? hes the best!
[1:47:45] <Conky89> Damn, taxi can drivers dress up all spiffy in the Yakuza universe
[1:47:45] <OhioNitsud> Dragon style is a consumable
[1:47:46] <+Sulfur_Boride> Iron wall of Majima
[1:47:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> I want a Majima moment where he goes. Fuck it lets not fight here is your shit. go.
[1:47:47] <%Mekhet09> These next bosses are going to be really fun.
[1:47:49] <ChoculaUltra> come at him, hard.
[1:47:49] <DougintheTrench> Jesus @Kirby_Sauce I'm always impressed by your generosity with the bits. I know you probably hear this a lot but make your got enough for yourself al'right?
[1:47:49] <%DPaq06> Pocket racing sucks
[1:47:57] <%Gogogolem> oh shit hes going his knife out.
[1:47:58] <mayorrev> LIGHTSABER
[1:47:59] <Dr_Mooose> oh shit the knife
[1:48:03] <$SleepyMaribo> the only fight in the game i legit lost
[1:48:04] <Ner234> KNIFE monkaS
[1:48:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Oh boy, he's getting serious
[1:48:07] <%Laecerelius> Fucking lightsaber knife!
[1:48:08] <shoobieredgrave> somebody should mod kiryu to go TRICKS-SWOR-GUNSLI-ROYAL GUARD! when he switches styles
[1:48:11] <%Das_Bass> glowing knife time
[1:48:11] <+BaekTheHeck> knife skill god damn
[1:48:12] <+Grayhammatter> he's got a knife monkaS
[1:48:15] <%Solidnick18> yeeee true style
[1:48:20] <majindusto> POCKET RACING IS FUCKING EASY
[1:48:21] <PerrinIsDead> Heres why Tiger Drop should be unlocked for game journalists
[1:48:22] <%XzileGaming> CRAB BATTLE
[1:48:26] <$RubberFistFight> @DougintheTrench it'd be more impressive if he hadn't attached it to attempts to "gotcha" pat in the past.
[1:48:27] <%waifoong98> "muh nippon steel Tanto" Kappa
[1:48:28] <%Solidnick18> that's a hellfire dagger
[1:48:30] <gustavozxd> 3 bars? See you in the next 30 hours I guess
[1:48:39] <%thelonechris> Never bring a fist to a knife fight
[1:48:46] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PerrinIsDead I love that game journalists think they are disabled
[1:48:46] <ChoculaUltra> mikiri counter the knife thrust
[1:48:47] <KeiPrime> would abeen nice to have tiger drop or somethin for all these life bars
[1:48:48] <dekkitout> For whatever reason, the "and Here's Why" part always rubbed me the wrong way- as if this 20-7- minute video isn't going to elaborate why, okay...
[1:48:51] <ooblag> Demon Majima is actually one of his easier styles to fight
[1:48:57] <Conky89> Fist > knife
[1:49:05] <%Solidnick18> deflect knife
[1:49:14] <T_Sasquatch> man yakuza looks so fucking crazy with all these flames and after image dashes, and the series just ignores it LUL
[1:49:20] <%waifoong98> @doc_ock_rokc their brain is disabled tho LUL
[1:49:21] <%Kirby_Sauce> @DougintheTrench I don't care too much for real money, I don't really need it when I die do I?
[1:49:28] <%Solidnick18> majima doing big posture damage
[1:49:29] <KeiPrime> "and heres why" and also "and that's a good thing" are signs youre about to read total garbage
[1:49:31] <%Niney_Who> You need some level of heat to do the Cyclone Throw beast counter
[1:49:31] <shoobieredgrave> godspeed and dash cancelling honestly trivializes majima fights
[1:49:40] <%Niney_Who> And it has to be avoiding an attack
[1:49:41] <deafmutelaughing> his laugh sounds like hammil's joker, which is funny, considering
[1:49:53] <natebud> i always feel bad for those monk guys who have to parry your sword.
[1:50:04] <+misterfistor> Man wouldn't it be rad of Shin Yakuza introduced Style-switching and move-cancelling into other styles
[1:50:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @KeiPrime And here is why that is a good thing
[1:50:11] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @waifoong98 Calling game journalists disabled is insulting to disabled people Kappa
[1:50:12] <KeiPrime> god damn you
[1:50:14] <%Solidnick18> it's great
[1:50:16] <$RubberFistFight> @natebud I felt sorry for them for about .5 seconds before they started kicking my ass
[1:50:17] <dekkitout> Also "brutally honest" in contrast to... mercifully honest?
[1:50:18] <PerrinIsDead> Game journalists are disabled and heres why thats a good thing
[1:50:24] <%waifoong98> @Valentinius_Anodyne you know what, that's a fair point LUL
[1:50:27] <%Mekhet09> You don't have it.
[1:50:27] <shoobieredgrave> it feels like you're the bad guy when you have to kill those monks in sekiro
[1:50:28] <+Grayhammatter> LUL
[1:50:31] <T_Sasquatch> ahahahhahahahaha
[1:50:32] <ooblag> You don't have it unlocked LUL
[1:50:32] <%Solidnick18> dragon style
[1:50:34] <T_Sasquatch> SUCK IT
[1:50:34] <%Niney_Who> You uh... don't have it
[1:50:37] <%BigNerdSam> LUL
[1:50:43] <troxcree> Someone should've levelled up Dragon Style.
[1:50:43] <%Solidnick18> on the red
[1:50:44] <%Niney_Who> GRIND for Dragon KIWAMI LUL
[1:50:45] <pimpinahz> LUL
[1:50:47] <%afronooch> L
[1:50:54] <Run44forrest> This is my main gripe with the game. theres no reason you should grind for dragon style kiwami the final boss needs it
[1:50:54] <%Naho_Saenoki> LUL
[1:50:54] <+MechaBaphomet> LUL
[1:50:55] <sukiyakiwestern> the monks are horrible what are you talking about
[1:50:56] <Conky89> I would just ignore game journalism tbh. Just make of a game for what it is.
[1:50:57] <pimpinahz> masaka
[1:50:57] <T_Sasquatch> Its almost like you could atleast upgrade SOME of it
[1:50:58] <$RubberFistFight> @dekkitout "brutally honest" is misused a lot, i agree. It's supposed to mean "honest with absolutely no regard to its effect on others"
[1:50:59] <Fujiwara_92> Dragon style pat
[1:51:06] <+Eddy21forsaken> you would have had it if you did pocket racing
[1:51:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> You are really fucked now
[1:51:10] <+zaworldo> PPPFFFF
[1:51:11] <ancrest_tant> Too bad you'll never max it out for it
[1:51:11] <Caidezes> You played yourself.
[1:51:15] <shoobieredgrave> those monks were minding their business and they have no weapons
[1:51:19] <+zaworldo> He'll never max it out
[1:51:23] <+zaworldo> I mean he's doing it
[1:51:24] <%Solidnick18> OH SHIT
[1:51:27] <%bread_assassin> You can use any heat move when he's like that.
[1:51:29] <+Grayhammatter> too bad you won't max it out
[1:51:29] <%castcode> OH
[1:51:31] <+zaworldo> or not
[1:51:31] <%waifoong98> totally not dead Kappa
[1:51:42] <deafmutelaughing> hold on Majima, let me drink this real quick
[1:51:42] <%Quentinmr> you cheated the game
[1:51:43] <dsauce999> pop your exceed
[1:51:43] <ooblag> Majima has never killed ANYONE
[1:51:45] <sukiyakiwestern> @shoobieredgrave those monks experimented on children and made the centipedes
[1:51:45] <ChoculaUltra> how's the Fist of the North Star Yakuza game?
[1:51:46] <%Quentinmr> you cheated yourself
[1:51:55] <zk_nails> I can't believe Kyriu is dead
[1:52:03] <dsauce999> Why isn't pat max-acting more? Kappa
[1:52:05] <%Kirby_Sauce> And you cheated yourself
[1:52:05] <Unlimited_Coffee_Works> Let's all take a moment to remember the Yakuza movie, which was mostly mediocre except for Majima, who carried the entire thing
[1:52:07] <%Das_Bass> "I didnt pay 60 bucks to be called dismal"
[1:52:12] <DougintheTrench> @RubberFistFight I'm not big on trolling, but I'll say that's a little impressive it's own right. He's... enthusiasm and willingness to spend money to sate such enthusiasm is something I could never do, even if they can be a bit more...questionalble at times.
[1:52:21] <$Wafflum> Pull your devil trigger!
[1:52:21] <shoobieredgrave> @sukiyakiwestern they rid the world of children and made cool ass centipedes. Rest in peace noble monks.
[1:52:22] <%GarbageNirvana> @ChoculaUltra Hasn't been played here but everyone I've seen touch it says it's great, minus the questionable vehicle sections
[1:52:23] <DraxTD> why do I fintly hear Naruto music... is Woolie in the house playing his tunes??
[1:52:28] <%Naho_Saenoki> @Unlimited_Coffee_Works Aren't there two of those films?
[1:52:29] <EuropantLamprey> It's the games fault I had to cheat
[1:52:31] <InugamiTheHound> so what did I miss stream?
[1:52:41] <natebud> majima looks away for a second, and kiryu's on the ground with a royale bottle in his mouth.
[1:52:44] <$Quack_of_Dawn> What if you need that staminan later?
[1:52:48] <ooblag> I really fucking hate how boss stat get higher as they take damage, including defense
[1:52:58] <%AKPC_> AKPC_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! woot
[1:52:59] <%waifoong98> Use your consumables Pat Kappa
[1:53:00] <%GarbageNirvana> Majima's just yuckin' it up
[1:53:11] <+zaworldo> Is majima even fighting at this point?
[1:53:15] <ChoculaUltra> @GarbageNirvana eggcellent. I'll take a crack at the demo on psn.
[1:53:16] <deafmutelaughing> waifoong98 but he might need them later
[1:53:17] <%Quentinmr> majima looks like an MHA villain
[1:53:19] <EuropantLamprey> So what's Majina's Ballyhoo?
[1:53:35] <$RubberFistFight> fucken stabbed the shit out of that truck tired just then
[1:53:36] <SilverFaustX> lol
[1:53:36] <%Edgy_Macaroon> dragon has good heat moves you should grind
[1:53:36] <%SvenHolgersson> SvenHolgersson subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months! 6 months! Glad to support my favorite vertically challenged OCD ginger. Keep up the great(?) work
[1:53:38] <%afronooch> LUL
[1:53:41] <%waifoong98> @deafmutelaughing but that later is nawwww Kappa
[1:53:43] <ChoculaUltra> Shin Majima?!
[1:53:45] <+zaworldo> Dragon has great heat moves
[1:53:59] <%Quentinmr> what about dragon style?
[1:54:00] <KeiPrime> dragon style has all the good moves
[1:54:06] <Fujiwara_92> at least get a dragon heat move dude, for situations like this
[1:54:12] <+zaworldo> Dragon style literally only has great heat moves
[1:54:18] <OhioNitsud> the fotns game is great. driving around for resources is a grind though
[1:54:24] <%spiritofmojave> there's a particular move with dragon style, the name escapes me apatSmug
[1:54:24] <%Quentinmr> I heard some good shit about dragon style
[1:54:25] <shoobieredgrave> yea its almost like dragon style is kiryus signature style that the entire game is based around
[1:54:28] <%waifoong98> at least Majima doesn't have royal guard, aka BP run ender in DMC4 lol
[1:54:29] <%Mekhet09> You can't actually get the kiwami move until majima SSS
[1:54:34] <%Edgy_Macaroon> Grind dragon style for heat moves
[1:54:34] <KeiPrime> give me the moves, i dont want to do the time earning them tho
[1:54:39] <Ridderzwaard> hihihiih
[1:54:39] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat go Brawler style and throw a BARREL at him?
[1:54:40] <ancrest_tant> I don't think you can get the heat move for dragon until after this fight
[1:54:45] <Basch71> how can you have good heat moves if you're not a Dragon Kappa
[1:54:47] <+zaworldo> It's almost like the DRAGON OF DOKIMA should be using dragon sryle
[1:54:51] <+zaworldo> but hey
[1:54:58] <%Tucker0603> why isn't Pat using that godspeed stuff?
[1:55:01] <SilverFaustX> frames
[1:55:08] <%SaltyDongs> Kick Punch

[1:58:38] <%AbnormalVoid> lmao, pat couldn't figure out pocket racer
[1:58:38] <%SvenHolgersson> Never killed a man
[1:58:40] <SilverFaustX> its a puzzle game
[1:58:40] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> It was fine at first, but yeah, all that for a fucking fight.
[1:58:40] <%SvenHolgersson> Ever
[1:58:43] <%Solidnick18> pat pls
[1:58:44] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's not great, but there's way worse out there
[1:58:45] <%Niney_Who> You can just look up the Perfect Builds and Walkthrough for Pocket Racer. I beat 0's entire Pocket Racer storyline in like 90 minutes
[1:58:45] <Desertfishing> pat doesnt like sext bug ladies only broken blind ladies Kappa
[1:58:46] <%mercado94> Old man yells at clouds

[1:58:54] <%castcode> Oh he's alive
[1:58:54] <RadSuit> Translation: I'm bad at it so I don't wanna.
[1:58:55] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat do you want a guide on them? theres a guide out there that'll tell ya want you need to do em easy
[1:58:56] <%El_Desperad0> IT IS NOT EASY
[1:58:57] <%Keyd00d> but no tho
[1:58:58] <dekkitout> They're not mutually exclusive
[1:58:59] <%afronooch> boring, sure, but no MesuKing or fucking Cat Fighting
[1:59:00] <%Quentinmr> new non-consumabel upgrade tho
[1:59:01] <+HellCopter> But that's what real pocket circuit racing it like
[1:59:05] <majindusto> Its Not Awful Tho
[1:59:07] <shoobieredgrave> even guides barely help tbh
[1:59:07] <%galaxyswirl> how is it awful tho?
[1:59:09] <ChoculaUltra> how?! the most deadest of dudes in that fight was just bent over breathing hard.
[1:59:11] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat no pat you're not allowed to dislike something other people like, didn't you pay attention on Twitter just before? Kappa
[1:59:15] <hussdogrob> It feels like your rubbing the fact that your not doing them in our faces Pat
[1:59:16] <%waifoong98> It is sooooo harddddd thooo Pat Kappa
[1:59:16] <%Mekhet09> It takes like ten minutes to get a build good enough to beat majima.
[1:59:17] <natebud> Pat, instead of doing this dumb bullshit, do this other dumb easy bullshit.
[1:59:18] <%DPaq06> Why do something you don't enjoy?
[1:59:21] <OhioNitsud> just do the komaki and coliseum. you'll unlock the kiwami and good supers.
[1:59:21] <+DukeMoose> but the musuking music is GOOD
[1:59:24] <Them00n> But it's optimal for your build @AngriestPat
[1:59:30] <BetesBoy> but you upgrade the car and its stat numbers go up
[1:59:31] <silverira> YOU ARE CRAZY
[1:59:32] <@commanderclaw> Nah, play the tiddy bug game though
[1:59:33] <%Das_Bass> i hate the majhong or however you spell it
[1:59:33] <+코코꾸라> Please never play Pocket Racing
[1:59:35] <Fujiwara_92> what? you want fun in a mini game ? are you crazy?
[1:59:36] <$RubberFistFight> @hussdogrob he is, because the complainers won't shut up with the complaining
[1:59:37] <VanLynx> that's a statement
[1:59:38] <mayorrev> LUL
[1:59:39] <worldbrand> you can't even say Pocket Racer needs big anime tiddies because that couldnt save MesuKing
[1:59:40] <%psychocalibur> psychocalibur subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! do the thing, pat
[1:59:40] <%waifoong98> So? LUL
[1:59:42] <RetributionP> you don't understand pat. you have to find the perfect combination to make the ULTIMATE RACER
[1:59:42] <troxcree> Majima's really good at it though.

[2:01:53] <ooblag> @AngriestPat The MuseKing and Pocket Racer bonuses are a super situational Heat Move, and a minor buff that doesn't matter. Dragon Style is still WAY THE FUCK BETTER then every other style with the other stuff
[2:01:55] <%AbnormalVoid> you only have to do it for like 15 minutes @AngriestPat
[2:01:57] <%Quentinmr> G O B L I N S

[2:02:22] <KeiPrime> mesuking is one of the check the emails
[2:02:26] <%Keyd00d> this game isn't worth doing all that, get to Kiwami 2 ASAP imo
[2:02:29] <%radda343> but boobs tho
[2:02:31] <%MagickBurritoh> WHAT
[2:02:32] <+zaworldo> BUT
[2:02:33] <%Niney_Who> But you can
[2:02:33] <+HellCopter> @AngriestPat Do you think you'll do K2 or 6 next? K2 is obviously next chronologically but 6's gameplay is a lot more simple
[2:02:33] <silverira> Essence of Goblin
[2:02:34] <ooblag> WHY
[2:02:34] <Rhinoprotoss> YOU CAN THO
[2:02:35] <KeiPrime> its entirely possible to do that
[2:02:35] <+zaworldo> YOU CAN
[2:02:36] <dekkitout> I can relate to "Eh, I don't feel like grinding it out"
[2:02:37] <Caidezes> He's being a big baby, basically.
[2:02:38] <%MagickBurritoh> THE FUCK
[2:02:39] <%Niney_Who> You just hate it
[2:02:39] <%Mekhet09> These next few fights are going to be FUN
[2:02:40] <%AbnormalVoid> ah, mental illness, got it
[2:02:41] <+Maids4lyfe> you can
[2:02:42] <sukiyakiwestern> thus man is crazy
[2:02:43] <+mik255> pat you already got some of it red
[2:02:44] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you can tho
[2:02:44] <Aji__> Is yakuza on pc?
[2:02:46] <ooblag> It is
[2:02:47] <%Niney_Who> that's fair
[2:02:47] <%BestTeaMaker> it's the goblins
[2:02:51] <%afronooch> true
[2:02:52] <+Eddy21forsaken> yeah but number go up
[2:02:54] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @waifoong98 You're talking to the guy who played hours of Poker in Red Dead Redemption for fun and money B)
[2:02:54] <%Mekhet09> Tiger drop is the only thing that matters.
[2:02:56] <%Niney_Who> But pat you don't get the SUPLEX
[2:02:57] <shoobieredgrave> it totally isn't. Godspeed is all u need
[2:02:57] <mayorrev> fair enough
[2:02:57] <natebud> Wasn't worth it in 0 either
[2:03:01] <%Mekhet09> And it makes the game much easier.
[2:03:03] <%waifoong98> @Valentinius_Anodyne jesus christ
[2:03:05] <%ECRead> that's fair
[2:03:07] <majindusto> PAT IS BEING A BIG SMELLY BABY
[2:03:08] <Caidezes> Kiwami 2 is so much better.
[2:03:08] <%Laecerelius> Yakuza 0, Kiwami, and Kiwami 2 are all on PC I think
[2:03:11] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @AngriestPat But there is some stuff that is prtty usefull, likee the dragon Kiwami move or whateever the fuck...
[2:03:11] <%galaxyswirl> thats fair, but dragon style is still the best
[2:03:14] <+mik255> @AngriestPat doesnt it hurt your goblins more if you leave it undone?
[2:03:15] <SilverFaustX> 2 is coming to pc
[2:03:17] <ancrest_tant> That part makes sense
[2:03:20] <Turtleomertle> nani
[2:03:21] <%MagickBurritoh> Is this bitch fo real
[2:03:22] <KeiPrime> this is NOT the original version tho
[2:03:24] <RadSuit> Pat hates Yakuza confirmed.
[2:03:25] <silverira> fuck you do it again
[2:03:25] <+Redpointshine> NAHKNEE
[2:03:26] <KeiPrime> obviously
[2:03:26] <Rhinoprotoss> Yeah but you beat REmake too
[2:03:27] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat Doesnt count
[2:03:29] <%DPaq06> Get to Yakuza 6 to enjoy something new
[2:03:31] <@commanderclaw> I'll take Pocket Circuit over Hostess bullshit any day
[2:03:33] <%bread_assassin> Take back the passport, now.
[2:03:35] <%zanzibar_junker> yakuza 6 is pretty good
[2:03:35] <CastellanVon> Tiger Drop is actually broken enough to make all fights take like 10 seconds but fair.
[2:03:41] <DreamerTTV> where
[2:03:49] <SilverFaustX> 6 is good but 2 has better gameplay
[2:03:51] <takiyami> ngl Kiwami 1 just isn't that good. Definitely feels rushed in a lot of respects.
[2:03:53] <gustavozxd> even if it doesn't count that doesn't mean this game is meh
[2:03:53] <%Mekhet09> No one wants you to get tiger drop just to get it. They want you to get it to speed up fights.
[2:03:55] <sukiyakiwestern> pat needs an easy mode
[2:03:56] <%waifoong98> if it's not recorded, it doesn't count Kappa
[2:03:58] <%zanzibar_junker> i love the bar in yakuza 6
[2:03:58] <%AncelDeLambert> am I crazy or is this woman not a great voice actor?
[2:03:59] <RadSuit> Gotta rush through this to play the next flavor of the week game that's in the news.
[2:03:59] <%Keyd00d> No way, hostess is fun
[2:04:01] <%spiritofmojave> Hostess bullshit was great in Zero atleast
[2:04:04] <%AncelDeLambert> she sounds stilted
[2:04:05] <hussdogrob> @angriestpat but you've looked at all of Japan's incredible liquor correct?
[2:04:07] <dsauce999> But you need to play optimally to fulfull the chat's OCD tho
[2:04:08] <%AbnormalVoid> I liked them both lol
[2:04:12] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Pruned tres are betteer than Bare roots @AngriestPat
[2:04:14] <shoobieredgrave> what in the fuck? does pat even like these games outside the story mode?
[2:04:16] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat If since you're playing on pc, why not just find a save that has everything done on it but amon
[2:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> @spiritofmojave I liked it more than the real estate shit
[2:04:19] <%SvenHolgersson> Hostess is good for the joke girls but other than that its trash
[2:04:30] <+Dreek93> I'd take anything over mahjong.
[2:04:33] <natebud> Hostless in like those restaurant flash games. Not too bad, just stay away from the creepy anime dressup bullshit.
[2:04:34] <KeiPrime> he;s not on pc this is the ps4 version
[2:04:40] <%zanzibar_junker> i love the hostess minigame
[2:04:40] <%AncelDeLambert> @Dreek93 even shogi?
[2:04:45] <%zanzibar_junker> easy money
[2:04:47] <%spiritofmojave> @AncelDeLambert Both were solid, but I feel you
[2:04:54] <%Futurecity10> It is shit
[2:05:00] <%Niney_Who> Don't you get to fight a bear at one point though
[2:05:00] <+zaworldo> Nah it's fine
[2:05:01] <ooblag> It's easy, they're just one fight each
[2:05:02] <+mik255> @AngriestPat your missing a bunch of the best moves
[2:05:04] <GustauveVIII> you can farm one of the advanced coliseum matches by pushing the fighters out of the ring
[2:05:06] <InugamiTheHound> is this dragon upgrades?
[2:05:07] <SilverFaustX> i learned how to play mahjong cause of this fucking game..
[2:05:07] <+zaworldo> it's literally easy
[2:05:08] <%Edgy_Macaroon> It's fine
[2:05:08] <KeiPrime> i liked the hostess game but i also like diner dash its just sexier diner dash
[2:05:09] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Honestly, I think the Cat Fighting in 0 is the only Yakuza minigame I actually dislike
[2:05:10] <%DPaq06> Youre not wrong lol
[2:05:10] <$RubberFistFight> Do you guys actually pay attention to Pat? If he wanted to do something, he'd do it. If he didn't want to do it, he won't do it. Like... no amount of cajoling or pleading will really change that.
[2:05:11] <%Keyd00d> everybody really likes one thing and hates the other
[2:05:17] <majindusto> GOBLINS = BITCH COWARD
[2:05:18] <%zanzibar_junker> coliseum takes forever
[2:05:19] <dekkitout> This is the same reaction I had to finding out where Arcanes came from in Warframe
[2:05:21] <gustavozxd> "literally easy" NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:05:21] <%brickwall35> I can't believe Pat is afraid of Hot Wheels
[2:05:22] <%zanzibar_junker> 5o
[2:05:22] <@commanderclaw> Nah, like 7
[2:05:23] <%AbnormalVoid> 30 rounds of fuckin' Kreygasm
[2:05:24] <%ECRead> it's a lot
[2:05:25] <alexandrecau> @AncelDeLambert think the va hostess was trying an accent since she is half chinese
[2:05:25] <ooblag> Blast through the Ring Out Arena match. I did it in 20 minutes
[2:05:28] <sukiyakiwestern> just cheat and write an article about it
[2:05:31] <%Niney_Who> Pat hates grinding but plays Warframe Kappa
[2:05:34] <shoobieredgrave> @AngriestPat I unlocked this full tree the 1st playthrough and it actually made me hate this game for a year until i ignored it my 2nd playthrough
[2:05:35] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat dont try to justify it, its really not worth it and its pointless if you're not fighting amon
[2:05:37] <ChoculaUltra> Pat? You mean Elmo's caretaker? Yeah I guess he's alright.
[2:05:40] <+Redpointshine> HOLY
[2:05:43] <%castcode> did he just
[2:05:44] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Wow
[2:05:48] <Ner234> DED AF
[2:05:50] <+Dreek93> you can use a guide for shogi, mahjong is luck plus learning how to play for completion
[2:05:52] <+funnyfunnykid> You a Matchbox guy or something?
[2:05:52] <%SvenHolgersson> He's fineeeee
[2:05:53] <+BaekTheHeck> dont blame you for just wanting to get kiwami over with. kiwami 2 is much better
[2:05:54] <MasterDecoder> @Niney_Who I mean, warframe is fun...
[2:05:54] <%Mekhet09> How can you hate hotwheels.
[2:05:54] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat think of it like donky kong 64 or counting only the prideful coin of the american penny as a cashier
[2:05:57] <%waifoong98> Pat hates hotwheel bc he is small just like them Kappa
[2:05:58] <ShichiNoBushi> Just have Paige play it for you.
[2:06:05] <NickHatesSnow> I just come and Pat hates Hot Wheels?
[2:06:06] <%king_wragles> I got up for a bit, we're not actually going to be put through boxcar racing are we?
[2:06:06] <%zanzibar_junker> you hate car toys?
[2:06:07] <%Sasquatch_John> @AngriestPat I had no problem in the coliseum in this game, it wasn't the best but its way better than the one in Kiwami 2
[2:06:10] <%Niney_Who> LUL
[2:06:11] <%king_wragles> I was just fucking around with that
[2:06:13] <ooblag> No
[2:06:13] <%El_Desperad0> No
[2:06:13] <%Niney_Who> Well...
[2:06:14] <%Futurecity10> @AngriestPat you dont
[2:06:15] <%spiritofmojave> Paige needs to buy some hotwheels for Pat now
[2:06:15] <%Niney_Who> No
[2:06:16] <%waifoong98> Git gud
[2:06:16] <%Sasquatch_John> No
[2:06:16] <SilverFaustX> Kappa
[2:06:16] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RubberFistFight You are right I guess, the whole situation bothers me, and it doesn't help that I don't knowww the details about the upgrade tre itself...
[2:06:17] <%Keyd00d> shoji?
[2:06:18] <@commanderclaw> No
[2:06:18] <%Tucker0603> no
[2:06:18] <%Edgy_Macaroon> no you dont
[2:06:20] <$KnivesEve> maybe
[2:06:20] <+mik255> yakuza's hard modes arent fun
[2:06:23] <CastellanVon> no thank god.
[2:06:23] <KeiPrime> you dont have to play shoGI or mahjohng
[2:06:24] <%zanzibar_junker> no
[2:06:25] <dekkitout> Sounds right for what Majima's pulled so far
[2:06:25] <BeagleCypher> That would be great.
[2:06:28] <%spiritofmojave> Not necessary, thank christ
[2:06:30] <%BigNerdSam> What the fuck is Sho-jee???
[2:06:30] <$Quack_of_Dawn> Shoji LUL
[2:06:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I think you mean Shogi
[2:06:32] <+Dreek93> No, just for completion list stuff.
[2:06:35] <majindusto> Pat never experienced the love of Hot Wheels in his sad childhood
[2:06:40] <gustavozxd> I hate both of them so much
[2:06:40] <KeiPrime> unless you want that trophy for haruka's affection in the post game
[2:06:45] <ChoculaUltra> how would you guys feel if the Yakuza mini-games were "localized" to like Checkers or Connect Four
[2:06:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Just in Gungi
[2:06:47] <KeiPrime> theny ou gotta learn hanafuda cards too
[2:06:47] <ooblag> They're just events for free Majima Progression, not unlock events
[2:06:48] <%AncelDeLambert> Man I love playing the Shoji Tabuchi minigame
[2:06:49] <%Niney_Who> @AngriestPat If you want a counter you should test out the Cyclone throw on some guys
[2:06:50] <SilverFaustX> i beat mahjong in yakuza 2
[2:06:52] <CastellanVon> fuck Haruka
[2:06:52] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat it'd probably take like 20 minutes at most do everything you need and beat Majima at pocket circuit. Mesu King even less I think
[2:06:53] <ShichiNoBushi> "Shogi" he means.
[2:06:54] <%Futurecity10> I believe 100%ing Yakuza games is just all moves and all sub quests
[2:06:55] <SilverFaustX> it sucked
[2:06:58] <%Keyd00d> he's just saying shogi in quebec language Kappa
[2:07:01] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Shogi is great, but I'm super bad at it, Good thing it's optional
[2:07:04] <natebud> I still have no idea how to play majong. Koi-koi is the shit though.
[2:07:04] <hussdogrob> Guys Pat doesn't wanna do hot wheels cause it would make him use his items which the goblins don't like
[2:07:08] <ooblag> You kind of are. Every boss is going to start taking a LOT longer
[2:07:08] <%Niney_Who> It's not a heat move
[2:07:16] <%AncelDeLambert> Yakuza does a terrible job of teaching you shogi
[2:07:25] <gustavozxd> @choculaultra that would be bad, Yakuza is fun because it's a 100% JAPAN game, about Japan and all that
[2:07:26] <ameraaaaaa> i just woke up
[2:07:26] <%DPaq06> I don't understand Majong at all
[2:07:26] <KeiPrime> its not a game to learn it thats for sure
[2:07:28] <SilverFaustX> i hate shogi
[2:07:29] <ancrest_tant> I felt that the last part of the game just flies by
[2:07:30] <$RubberFistFight> @Bane_Kaikyo all you're gonna do by nagging Pat is piss him off and ruin his stream. Do you really wanna be the guy who does that?
[2:07:34] <%AncelDeLambert> like, beginner mode the guy just beat my ass in
[2:07:39] <+mik255> @AngriestPat pat is willing to ignore number going up here but not in other games?
[2:07:41] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat It's Sho-Gi as in SHOw GEEk
[2:07:41] <%zanzibar_junker> tech?
[2:07:44] <%Reizie_Etherealm> What's with you and pronouncing G with a J? Like how you said Naginata
[2:07:46] <%galaxyswirl> i wonder why you feel like that
[2:07:47] <natebud> Shogi is just chess but confusing and bad
[2:07:54] <%Naho_Saenoki> I'm a huge fan of Koi-Koi, and even have an actual hanafuda deck to play it with.. I spent a lot of time playing it in 0.
[2:08:02] <%AncelDeLambert> @Reizie_Etherealm oh god I forgot he did that
[2:08:06] <flame_of_udun_> Majohng makes platinuming these games a pain in the ass
[2:08:09] <+Dreek93> I am getting good at mahjong from playing it so much for this completion list, but they want you to get specific style of hands and it's such slim odds.
[2:08:18] <%AncelDeLambert> BIG NUMBER
[2:08:20] <%spiritofmojave> Shogi/Mahjong for me was like learning Caravan to 100% NV
[2:08:20] <%Quentinmr> number go up?
[2:08:21] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RubberFistFight I'm agreing with you tho?.... like that first thing completely convinced m
[2:08:21] <KeiPrime> this game wasnt out in 2004 tho..
[2:08:23] <%actionhanktx> actionhanktx subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! Twitch wont leave me alone unless I share this so yaaay 5 months..
[2:08:24] <majindusto> That was 2004 tho
[2:08:24] <RadSuit> You had a PS4 in 2004?
[2:08:26] <RadSuit> Wow.
[2:08:27] <%Niney_Who> It was
[2:08:29] <%Niney_Who> 0 was amazing
[2:08:32] <%BestTeaMaker> i mean, yeah
[2:08:32] <shoobieredgrave> you had a ps4 in 2004? PogChamp
[2:08:35] <%Niney_Who> I actually don't want Kiwami
[2:08:38] <%Keyd00d> Kiwami 1 aint great
[2:08:38] <%Das_Bass> I still like this game
[2:08:41] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat wouldn't you want Dragon Style for your fight with Nishiki?
[2:08:42] <%BestTeaMaker> 0 was made recently
[2:08:44] <ooblag> It's literally faster to get Tiger Drop than to play without it though.
[2:08:48] <%AncelDeLambert> oh man, if Zero is better than all of these, then I have NO REASON to play any of them
[2:08:50] <+Eddy21forsaken> do you mean worse as in only combat?
[2:08:52] <DraxTD> @shoobieredgrave pat is a time traveler
[2:08:52] <NickHatesSnow> Whats the arcade game in this one anyways?
[2:08:53] <flame_of_udun_> Kiwami 2 is the better remake
[2:08:53] <%BestTeaMaker> kiwami is just a retrofitted game with 0's mechanics
[2:08:54] <FackinCrazy> Kiwami 2 feels much better but Zero is still #1
[2:08:55] <SilverFaustX> 1 is dated but stil good
[2:08:55] <%AncelDeLambert> cuz I gave up on 0 halfway through
[2:08:56] <%Edgy_Macaroon> you played yakuza not kiwami
[2:09:00] <%afronooch> 0 and kiwami were made at the same time pretty much
[2:09:03] <+misterfistor> aw ;w;
[2:09:05] <shoobieredgrave> only thing this game has over 0 is Essence of Godspeed.
[2:09:07] <T_Sasquatch> 0 is godlike but kiwami has better upgrade system, grinding for moves in 0 fucking sucks
[2:09:10] <natebud> I wonder if I should just play the original Yakuza 1 and just jump over to kiwami 2
[2:09:10] <%DPaq06> @AngriestPat are you planning to beat all Yakuzies before Judge Eyes?
[2:09:16] <+reddpop_> Pat seems to really hate his chat recently
[2:09:19] <Basch71> Kiwami 1 feels more like Yakuza 0 dlc in essence, but 2 feels better
[2:09:20] <majindusto> "2004" yakuza came out in 2005 (japan)
[2:09:21] <$RubberFistFight> @Bane_Kaikyo I guess I just don't understand "the whole situation bothers me".
[2:09:26] <%AncelDeLambert> @T_Sasquatch that's why I stopped playing it. Lady Tiger BLOWSSSS
[2:09:28] <%BigNerdSam> Pat is not Kiwami enough to become Shin-Pat Kiwami
[2:09:31] <hussdogrob> I wanna tiger drop some of y'all in this chat so you'll stop whining over tiger drop
[2:09:38] <Desertfishing> just kick his ass
[2:09:40] <$RubberFistFight> @reddpop_ probably because they don't stop pestering him about stupid shit and use really poorly constructed arguments to do so.
[2:09:44] <%zanzibar_junker> 6 would be a great brath of fresh air after this
[2:09:45] <%Keyd00d> shikata nai
[2:09:49] <KeiPrime> this is jerry trying to convince elaine to use the toothbrush
[2:09:53] <gustavozxd> @anceldelambert depends on the reason you stopped, I still prefer the original PS2 games even thought they might have some PS2 jank
[2:09:59] <VritraReiRei> you have so much money though LUL
[2:10:01] <KeiPrime> its just better but elaine likes her old toothbrush
[2:10:07] <%BigNerdSam> apatBig SEX
[2:10:16] <%Keyd00d> NotLikeThis
[2:10:17] <%castcode> lol
[2:10:19] <%radda343> good, now Kiryu can stare awkwardly at women and wonder what that's all about
[2:10:20] <%DPaq06> DPaq06 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 4 month streak! 
[2:10:21] <shoobieredgrave> what makes this game worse than 0 is it kept all the antiquated bullshit from 1 for the sake of nostalgia and being truthful to the original
[2:10:24] <T_Sasquatch> @AncelDeLambert your best bet is completely grinding cabaret which would take a long fucking time where you basically stop playing the game
[2:10:24] <%Fadedblank247> that's why you should stream fist of the north star next
[2:10:26] <DreamerTTV> play 5 you won't
[2:10:30] <+HellCopter> Nah 6 is a standalone game
[2:10:30] <flame_of_udun_> Still waiting on those remasters...
[2:10:31] <+DukeMoose> isnt 5 on PSNow?
[2:10:32] <%spiritofmojave> just YT it on here like a coward
[2:10:34] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I like how "Shinmei" literally translates into "new name"
[2:10:36] <%AbnormalVoid> @AngriestPat did you know you can play on the PS3 with the Dualshock 4?
[2:10:37] <%Sasquatch_John> John_Sasquatch subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Kiwami means Grinding!
[2:10:38] <%Niney_Who> Will pat ever help that homeless child
[2:10:39] <natebud> Point a camera at your TV to stream 5, like the good ol days.
[2:10:39] <Dest_121> just watch the cutscenes then @AngriestPat
[2:10:40] <pmtriox> he'll snap the necks of goons and thugs in the open streets, but he won't grab a pencil neck extorting him for a fucking map?
[2:10:41] <%afronooch> psnow sucks tho
[2:10:42] <+mik255> when they get rereleased?
[2:10:46] <%zanzibar_junker> just watch 5
[2:10:46] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat you can just watch a video compilation for 5
[2:10:47] <Shinjiro120> 5 is the worst in the series, watching the cutscenes is a better option imo
[2:10:49] <%Mogel56> Kiwami 5 ;)
[2:10:53] <+HellCopter> I skipped 2-5 and played 6, it's now my fav game in the series!
[2:10:56] <Prism_Wing> What you don't wanna use an HDMI splitter and all that shite?
[2:10:58] <%BigNerdSam> YES MY FAVORlTE MAJIMA SCENE
[2:11:00] <fruit_pie_the_magician> @AngriestPat The first HOUR of Yakuza six is an extended recap of the entire series
[2:11:00] <+xTronJavolta> You what's up guys?!
[2:11:01] <%Keyd00d> oh god I still need to play 3-6 and the fotns one
[2:11:02] <%Mekhet09> Crack open your PS3 and play puppeteer.
[2:11:05] <%GeneralSCPatton> IT'S A FIGHT TAXI!
[2:11:08] <MasterDecoder> It's a trap
[2:11:12] <T_Sasquatch> @afronooch actually it got pretty good, it works really well for me, i legit cant tell the difference sometimes
[2:11:13] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RubberFistFight I can be bothred about a thing and admit trying to scream until the thing changes wont do anything and just be useless screaming
[2:11:15] <%DPaq06> Are you going to beat all Yakuzas before judge eyes?
[2:11:18] <%AncelDeLambert> man, I hated the racing arcade minigame, that game BLEW CHUNKS
[2:11:20] <%zanzibar_junker> hiroshima is really refreshing
[2:11:22] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat yakuza 5 has a new area so it atleast feels a bit fresher
[2:11:22] <%trillmagical> oh man thats rough then
[2:11:26] <%Niney_Who> Time for Cyclone Throw
[2:11:27] <dekkitout> Are you gonna fight together?
[2:11:27] <natebud> It's weird I didn't notcied those guys
[2:11:28] <+DukeMoose> oh noh. goons
[2:11:30] <+misterfistor> ah now for the STUPIDEST RETCON
[2:11:33] <%MelBrooksKA> So why are you having trouble playing 5?
[2:11:36] <+Dreek93> @abnormalvoid Tried to do this with Yakuza 5 coincedently and the triggers don't have pressure sensitivity so you can't do the taxi stuff
[2:11:39] <%Tucker0603> BRO FIGHT
[2:11:41] <%Edgy_Macaroon> tag team
[2:11:42] <+HellCopter> Yakuza 6 is soooo good, the story is the best yet
[2:11:47] <gustavozxd> @anceldelambert you didn't like outrun? now that's funny LUL
[2:11:51] <dekkitout> An epic crossover! PogChamp
[2:11:53] <$RubberFistFight> @Bane_Kaikyo so you're admitting it's useless annoying screaming but you're still doing it? Even though you know it pisses pat off?
[2:11:54] <+Grayhammatter> fucking what
[2:11:55] <+misterfistor> THE WORST RETCON
[2:11:58] <+HellCopter> This scene at the docks is INSANELY dumb and only exists to rectify the fact that in the original game majima is recovering from a knife wound atm
[2:12:01] <%DPaq06> Haruka's part in 5 is awful
[2:12:02] <KeiPrime> It will make sense in a weird sorta way
[2:12:02] <%AncelDeLambert> My favorite minigame in Zero was the UFO catcher
[2:12:05] <KeiPrime> once the story continues
[2:12:06] <%zanzibar_junker> also the idol industry really f-d haruka over
[2:12:08] <%Keyd00d> this some goku vegeta shit
[2:12:08] <T_Sasquatch> @misterfistor shut up tho LUL
[2:12:09] <%radda343> when did Majima ever make sense
[2:12:10] <%AbnormalVoid> @Dreek93 ahh
[2:12:17] <+mik255> Majima joined your party!
[2:12:23] <alexandrecau> shut up pat kiwami means doesn't make sense
[2:12:23] <fruit_pie_the_magician> And also the plot of 6 might as well be an episode of Maury
[2:12:29] <alexandrecau> dual heat move
[2:12:31] <pmtriox> now the yakuza are using chinese swords
[2:12:39] <%AncelDeLambert> is that a golden golf club?
[2:12:40] <%GeneralSCPatton> Dante & Vergil vs Shit-tier Demons
[2:12:47] <+HellCopter> Y6 has the least dumb story imo
[2:12:52] <+Dreek93> @abnormalvoid You can fudge the normal stuff too but the race is literally uncompletable
[2:12:52] <hussdogrob> Cool he says as he frowns at the gameplay
[2:12:53] <+HellCopter> thanks beat takeshi
[2:13:01] <%radda343> he just punched you with a gun
[2:13:01] <natebud> I just notcied this game doesn't have a style meter like 0.
[2:13:04] <InugamiTheHound> i need to watch more of DMC5 LP I got really behind on it
[2:13:09] <%waifoong98> getting beat up by a gun in close range heh
[2:13:10] <%zanzibar_junker> Majima and Dante would totally hang out and eat pizza
[2:13:12] <+misterfistor> majima be more useful
[2:13:12] <Prism_Wing> assshots
[2:13:17] <ChoculaUltra> is 6 the one about revengeance?
[2:13:18] <%lewdskeletor13> @angriestpat he’s fighting these guys because he wants you all to himself I thought
[2:13:24] <%El_Desperad0> You keep taking long breaks for other games
[2:13:25] <ancrest_tant> Kiwami means Chinese sword
[2:13:27] <%Keyd00d> play OTHER game
[2:13:32] <shoobieredgrave> when does judge eyes release?
[2:13:34] <+HellCopter> Gahhh just skip 5
[2:13:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RubberFistFight No... I WAS screaming, then you were all like "that aint gonna changee shit" and I'm all "shit, you're right" and I stopped.... like.... I accepted defeat essentially...
[2:13:38] <+DukeMoose> you have other games that NEEDED to be played
[2:13:40] <alexandrecau> when judge eyes come out
[2:13:42] <+DukeMoose> had
[2:13:51] <%zanzibar_junker> there's a Cheers minigame in 6
[2:13:53] <%Keyd00d> july i think
[2:13:53] <+BaekTheHeck> so is judge eyes still coming out? have they delayed it bc the drug bullshit?
[2:13:55] <ミュウレ4242> every yakuza game is long. and 6 doesn't make much sense w/o playing at least 2 and 5.
[2:13:55] <KeiPrime> june isnt that far
[2:13:56] <%kewlmyc> Judgement is out in June yes
[2:13:58] <KeiPrime> its fucking april
[2:13:58] <hussdogrob> Just have a Yakuzie week
[2:14:00] <+misterfistor> Later in the year because they had to replace the drug guy
[2:14:01] <%zanzibar_junker> you become a bar regular
[2:14:05] <Dest_121> it might possibly be delayed
[2:14:10] <Prism_Wing> @shoobieredgrave After the cocaine is cleaned off the covers.
[2:14:17] <%Keyd00d> they confirmed no delay over the voice actor thing
[2:14:18] <gustavozxd> @baektheheck apparently they're just gonna redub the guy
[2:14:19] <Prism_Wing> Kappa
[2:14:19] <KeiPrime> its almost MId april aready
[2:14:25] <sukiyakiwestern> majima jobbing in the background
[2:14:26] <$RubberFistFight> @Bane_Kaikyo Ah ok. That makes a little more sense now. Glad we're on the same page.
[2:14:30] <$KnivesEve> pat's streaming judge eyes?
[2:14:31] <%afronooch> didnt they recently say its stil coming out in june?
[2:14:34] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I only played 0 and then 6 and I was totally fine thanks to the massive intro
[2:14:37] <+mik255> is it in 6 where heat moves do decent damage or in FOTN?
[2:14:40] <C__Lab> Lmao wtf majima
[2:14:41] <+DukeMoose> im just hyped up for May. Three Kingdoms!
[2:14:41] <alexandrecau> they said the cocaine was settled and game goes out as scheduled
[2:14:45] <majindusto> Pat and Yakuza are No Longer Best Friends
[2:14:46] <InugamiTheHound> why is your teammate AI in these games so bad!
[2:14:49] <shoobieredgrave> if anything that guy that sold coke should be in the TV ads
[2:14:50] <ancrest_tant> I wonder what's gonna be like without a main villain 's face
[2:14:50] <+Toxic_CIzzle> I'd like to hear pat's opinion on the combat in 6 because I think it's way worse than zero/kiwami
[2:14:53] <%spiritofmojave> Because cocaine is bad!
[2:14:57] <+Dreek93> @mule4242 do I need 2?i just bought 6 after starting with 5 and tried kiwami, is 2 required playing?
[2:15:01] <alexandrecau> pat supports cocaine
[2:15:01] <%zanzibar_junker> fuckin potshot
[2:15:01] <%king_wragles> cause one of the actors uses DRUGS!
[2:15:02] <%Fadedblank247> fist of north star game was great
[2:15:05] <gustavozxd> well you Technically didn't stream dmc5 so Kappa
[2:15:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those get up shots hit you 4/4 times, it's super effective
[2:15:07] <%Futurecity10> The first of the north star game was meh
[2:15:08] <%MisterTylerrr> Pat I can't believe you support COCAINE
[2:15:08] <+HellCopter> FotNS game is mediocre
[2:15:09] <%Bane_Kaikyo> @RubberFistFight spyPraise
[2:15:10] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat the FOTNS one is GRINDY as hell, even if its super fun
[2:15:22] <mayorrev> HEAT GUN
[2:15:23] <%GarbageNirvana> So are we just dead-set on calling it Judge Eyes even though it's officially called Judgment over here
[2:15:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat you can’t stream Judge Eyes cause cocaine is bad!
[2:15:26] <+misterfistor> you can't make out your skill tree in one playthrough i think
[2:15:30] <+Toxic_CIzzle> fist of the North Star was one of my favorites
[2:15:32] <%zanzibar_junker> heat shooting
[2:15:33] <conflict1914> the greatest martial art of all: GUN
[2:15:36] <Mirrorcatch> gun is the strongest martial art
[2:15:39] <+DukeMoose> Kiwami means GUN
[2:15:42] <%lewdskeletor13> apatGib apatGib apatGib
[2:15:42] <RealPT1> did you just armor a bullet?
[2:15:43] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I'm going to continue calling it Judgement Eyes
[2:15:47] <%AbnormalVoid> 3 point blank shots in the chest lol whatever
[2:15:50] <shoobieredgrave> Fist of the north star is actually the best yakuza game in terms of gameplay
[2:15:50] <Fiend95> Just armor through the bullets Kiryu, it's the Yakuza way
[2:15:56] <alexandrecau> it'S new
[2:15:56] <ooblag> 90% sure it's new
[2:15:56] <Basch71> it is
[2:16:02] <KeiPrime> 100% new
[2:16:06] <%lewdskeletor13> sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab sipsipDab
[2:16:06] <%DevTheKiller> DevTheKiller subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:16:06] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean how many mooks have had this same exact face
[2:16:06] <%zanzibar_junker> the fotns game gave kenshiro peronality by making him kiryu
[2:16:06] <alexandrecau> majima everywhere add on
[2:16:07] <+HellCopter> This is a story contrivance fight
[2:16:08] <Dest_121> i still don't know why they changed the name to judgement its so generic
[2:16:09] <gustavozxd> it's one of the many new trash content they added in kiwami
[2:16:18] <alexandrecau> old majima would never do that
[2:16:18] <%Mekhet09> It's not even the worst fight though.
[2:16:19] <Prism_Wing> I wonder if cocaine goes good with cornflakes. like a supercharged version of Frosted Flakes.
[2:16:19] <%Deekman> Yeah this ones new
[2:16:20] <ancrest_tant> If I believe hard enough, could I tank bullets
[2:16:24] <joneworldbeater> Hey stream. Have I missed much?
[2:16:24] <%manwithboxonhead> Did someone say GUN?!?
[2:16:26] <%Mekhet09> These are going to get worse.
[2:16:27] <%Niney_Who> There's worse
[2:16:27] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat This is added cuz of a major detail for the 2nd canon Majima fight.
[2:16:29] <panic_rabbit> it's for internal consistency with why Majima is still injured in the truck scene
[2:16:29] <ooblag> Get used to it, this is the rest of the game
[2:16:39] <%Mekhet09> Which is why I was saying get tiger drop.
[2:16:43] <%Keyd00d> I got real burnt out in the last 1/3 of this
[2:16:45] <%Niney_Who> I hope you like Big Cowards with Guns, pat
[2:16:45] <FeralFozzie> he has mastered the most deadliest martial art known: gun
[2:16:49] <Basch71> second half of this game is oops all guns and i-frames LuL
[2:16:51] <natebud> A yakuza game with a story contrivance!? No way! Kappa
[2:16:56] <%Edgy_Macaroon> complaining a lot
[2:16:56] <+Toxic_CIzzle> agreed shoobie. fist is just fun to play
[2:16:57] <%DarkSideCow> its new to sink up with majims condition in the old 1
[2:16:59] <shoobieredgrave> this guy is OP if he can last this long against kiryu and majima handicap match
[2:17:03] <alexandrecau> he is injured because he rammed a fucking truck through shangri la
[2:17:10] <RealPT1> wake up gun
[2:17:12] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He does keep shooting you in the dick
[2:17:14] <%SvenHolgersson> RIGHT IN THE JUNK
[2:17:15] <%Niney_Who> The hardest fight in the SERIES is in this game and it's a Coward with a gun
[2:17:17] <%GarbageNirvana> This guy has too much health
[2:17:19] <hussdogrob> Pat seems like he's just on auto right now, just a good time zoning out to a repetitive gameplay loop
[2:17:20] <ooblag> Kiryu has gotten shot in the dick like 20 times this fight
[2:17:22] <ミュウレ4242> there's armor and upgrades that mitigate stun time and damage from guns.
[2:17:24] <KeiPrime> he obviously keeps shooting on wake up
[2:17:28] <Dest_121> he has way too much health
[2:17:32] <+mik255> This series is really bad with its spongy bosses
[2:17:37] <Conky89> Ok the health of the enemies is getting quite ridiculous...
[2:17:38] <%radda343> only pat rearranges his inventory in the middle of a fistfight
[2:17:41] <lizard0tm> Gun is VERY strong
[2:17:45] <joneworldbeater> Just got in. How long's the stream been going so far?
[2:17:46] <alexandrecau> Ishikawa stronger than saejima
[2:17:51] <%waifoong98> what other teammate? the air?
[2:17:51] <DracaenaLeaf> to be fair there's a lot of air punches made by majima
[2:17:52] <%Laecerelius> This guy is taking forever to kill
[2:17:54] <arcaderabbit48> Majima and Kiryu teaming up should be awesome, but this looks super tedious and unfun
[2:17:56] <ooblag> And every boss now has that much health, or more
[2:17:57] <%afronooch> !uptime
[2:17:57] <worldbrand> this guy drank all the milk in his hometown growing up
[2:17:57] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 17m.
[2:17:58] <+mik255> That was a good finish
[2:17:59] <%Mekhet09> It's going to get worse.
[2:18:00] <pmtriox> man with gun is toughest man
[2:18:00] <ChoculaUltra> the double kick finish!
[2:18:01] <%Keyd00d> PHASE 2
[2:18:01] <+DukeMoose> and it was like 9 various goons
[2:18:02] <%TeraMercier> I much more dislike the bosses in these games that have no hitstun on kiryus attacks
[2:18:04] <ancrest_tant> Fights like these are why tiger drop exists
[2:18:04] <mayorrev> NOOOO
[2:18:06] <%Niney_Who> he's fine
[2:18:08] <ChoculaUltra> oh rip Majima
[2:18:08] <+cvp5127> welp
[2:18:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> That last double hit was actually pretty sweet
[2:18:09] <+HellCopter> lmao
[2:18:09] <ShichiNoBushi> Majima, NOOOOOOOOO!!
[2:18:10] <ameraaaaaa> his a tough motherfucker
[2:18:10] <%Mekhet09> It's going to get much much worse.
[2:18:10] <ShreddingPixels> RIP
[2:18:11] <natebud> I can't believe majima is dead
[2:18:11] <FackinCrazy> This guy is a hero who else but the legendary ishikawa could take on Kiryu AND Majima at the same time
[2:18:12] <+misterfistor> Kiryu doesn't care
[2:18:12] <Desertfishing> majima dead
[2:18:13] <Prism_Wing> YOU DIED

[2:18:22] <lizard0tm> GAME OVER
[2:18:23] <%SvenHolgersson> LUL
[2:18:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Majima is dead

[2:18:25] <st_jimmy456> shamRIP here lies Goro Majima shamRIP
[2:18:26] <Dao_Puppy> noooooo
[2:18:27] <ChoculaUltra> Kiryu is fine because he just ate like 300 bullets to the dick, Majima should be fine with 1.

[2:18:31] <alexandrecau> let him drown
[2:18:34] <+misterfistor> lol bye Majima
[2:18:35] <%Tearonex> doodStare
[2:18:36] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat It's added here cuz of the Majima Everywhere system literally destroying the significance of Majima getting stabbed after the 1st canon fight.
[2:18:36] <%VVytchdance> LUL
[2:18:38] <InugamiTheHound> wow no fucks given about him
[2:18:38] <%radda343> that truck isn't important, dont' worry about it
[2:18:39] <%Futurecity10> kuroba911
[2:18:39] <Them00n> That's cold kiryu
[2:18:39] <%waifoong98> Majima is Gone system
[2:18:40] <pmtriox> just saw a man die, casual stroll away
[2:18:40] <Dest_121> kiryu just doesn't care he might be dead
[2:18:41] <%Laecerelius> Kiryu cares so little. Yeesh. What a bad friend.
[2:18:42] <+JackMillerTime> hes not coming up he said
[2:18:43] <fluffypupperino> Hey Pat! It's Matt from freshman year! Remember me? I see your playing Yakuza Kiwami! You were such a freakin noob back in high school and you still are. Have fun running around searching for dog food and paper plates while I enjoy the updated graphics engine and superior cinematics and voice overs of Yakuza 6: Song of Life. Get rekt n00b.
[2:18:44] <alexandrecau> Kiryu attempted murder
[2:18:45] <MelancholicMasochist> I dont think kiryu would just leave
[2:18:45] <+DukeMoose> aww thats fucked
[2:18:45] <+WhereIsWill> *grapple away*
[2:18:46] <+mik255> i like that kiryu doesnt give a fuck either
[2:18:47] <natebud> Welcome the Majima Nowhere System.
[2:18:57] <%Mekhet09> Nope.
[2:19:05] <+misterfistor> DOGGO
[2:19:06] <%ALTRNico> !uptime
[2:19:06] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 19m.
[2:19:09] <%TeraMercier> Majima could get run over by a steamroller and I'd assume he'd be back in a couple scenes
[2:19:16] <+Redpointshine> Oh hey it's Date
[2:19:18] <ameraaaaaa> what's a nowhere system
[2:19:21] <Desertfishing> sell her
[2:19:24] <%lewdskeletor13> It’s Date, the ultimate DILF
[2:19:26] <alexandrecau> yes
[2:19:27] <dekkitout> No Kiryu, do not take the child.
[2:19:31] <GundamF91> kiryu would literally care a shit ton about that happening to majima, im so confused
[2:19:32] <$Wafflum> Fun fact, this game retcons it so Majima is a zombie in the other games. Kappa
[2:19:33] <@commanderclaw> Just take the child to the whorehouse
[2:19:36] <%radda343> hey guess what the entire plot of the last game is how that tiny babby girl got laid
[2:19:37] <ChoculaUltra> that child looks akin to the cg child from that one twilight movie.
[2:19:38] <alexandrecau> safer than with Date
[2:19:42] <DraxTD> 60 12
[2:19:44] <%zanzibar_junker> just go
[2:19:47] <+misterfistor> 13 i think? youre near the end
[2:19:48] <%zanzibar_junker> 13?
[2:19:50] <InugamiTheHound> remember when Kiryu dunked on Date and the other fat old guys for being huge losers!!
[2:19:54] <%BigNerdSam> Sure, taking children to the illegal sex house is perfectly fine, but doing cocaine is illegal. Thanks Japan.
[2:19:56] <%spiritofmojave> Don't take the child to soapland Kiryu
[2:20:03] <$Wafflum> Time to take the kid to the brothel!
[2:20:04] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat just wants to finish the game at this point LUL
[2:20:10] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Sounds like a great idea to take a child with you to a brothel
[2:20:12] <ミュウレ4242> i thought it was an illegal gambling house.
[2:20:15] <%Futurecity10> 11
[2:20:19] <ooblag> 10 or 11 I think?
[2:20:19] <Them00n> 11
[2:20:27] <MelancholicMasochist> you're close
[2:20:27] <%zanzibar_junker> 11
[2:20:29] <%radda343> she needs to learn how to make that baby to preserve the timeline
[2:20:33] <DracaenaLeaf> gotta finish them games
[2:20:33] <VritraReiRei> D:
[2:20:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I don't blame you
[2:20:36] <@commanderclaw> Yay, we're helping
[2:20:37] <fluffypupperino> It should say in the bottom left corner of the pause menu
[2:20:38] <natebud> Why didn't people vote for masquerade!?
[2:20:39] <%trillmagical> lol
[2:20:39] <+mr_whet_faartz> PJSalt PJSalt
[2:20:40] <%Afterman_> you shouldve dropped it for vampire
[2:20:40] <$rdark_ksu> Spite is a beautiful motivator
[2:20:41] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, man, I'd be cool with you dropping long winded games
[2:20:42] <%Quentinmr> we are the whiny babbies
[2:20:42] <ミュウレ4242> kiwami < 0, for sure.
[2:20:43] <%SvenHolgersson> WE DID IT REDDIT
[2:20:43] <%spiritofmojave> I would've been all for more Bloodline, but I'm not complaining
[2:20:44] <Dao_Puppy> Not fun?
[2:20:44] <$Wafflum> I'm surprised you're hating this so much
[2:20:50] <%Mekhet09> I'm not.
[2:20:51] <majindusto> FUCK OFF DROPPING THIS
[2:20:52] <sukiyakiwestern> pat the salt lord today
[2:20:53] <DracaenaLeaf> people did vote for vampire
[2:20:54] <%mastertwin2> apatDab we did it chat
[2:20:54] <%El_Desperad0> @natebud cause it's not as exciting to watch
[2:20:55] <Caidezes> It's all chat's fault.
[2:20:55] <%Mekhet09> The last 1/3 is shit,
[2:20:57] <DraxTD> will you stream Yakuza Kawamii 2 @AngriestPat ?
[2:20:59] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I hope we didn't force you into doing something you don't want to
[2:21:04] <Prism_Wing> When's Claire B on OG RE2? Kappa
[2:21:05] <Them00n> Why do you want to drop it?
[2:21:05] <mayorrev> Wait, that's illegal!
[2:21:06] <%Afterman_> chat voted for vampire but pat didnt trust us
[2:21:09] <MelancholicMasochist> its a fine game but pales to the others
[2:21:09] <ChoculaUltra> don't look at me, I voted for Kodos.
[2:21:12] <%SvenHolgersson> So if we bitch about Banjo Kazooie then will it happen @AngriestPat ?
[2:21:15] <%TeraMercier> Pass on Kiwami 2
[2:21:15] <ooblag> Kiwami 2 is MUCH better
[2:21:16] <%Mekhet09> And pat doesn't want to get the move that'll speed up these godawful fights.
[2:21:18] <+BaekTheHeck> kiwami 2 is great
[2:21:20] <Dest_121> kiwami 2 is a major improvement
[2:21:20] <gustavozxd> I was complaining for you to NOT play this
[2:21:24] <%zanzibar_junker> later
[2:21:30] <%Edgy_Macaroon> the game is fine
[2:21:33] <shoobieredgrave> fake fan
[2:21:34] <+mik255> thats because your an idiot
[2:21:35] <DraxTD> stream 5 then?
[2:21:39] <%Das_Bass> you were the chosen one
[2:21:41] <fluffypupperino> The Haruka section is fine
[2:21:41] <%Afterman_> he cant stream 5
[2:21:42] <T_Sasquatch> I liked kiwami 1 more than 2 but 2 is a much better game overall
[2:21:42] <DraxTD> to power through it with US ^^
[2:21:43] <Caidezes> Kiwami 2 is the only one worth playing besides 0.
[2:21:44] <Basch71> her section's not bad
[2:21:46] <%spiritofmojave> The idol shit is actually the equivalent to a run killer
[2:21:47] <%TeraMercier> Kiwami 2 is still great, but it's essentially a lot more of the same
[2:21:47] <+mik255> didnt have to finsih that
[2:21:47] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat WAIT you can play as Haruka!!!
[2:21:50] <%BigNerdSam> Of course the rhythm game sequence killed your interest.
[2:21:52] <majindusto> PAT IS NOT A TRUE YAKUZA FAN
[2:21:53] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat REAP WHAT YOU SOW
[2:21:54] <DraxTD> oh right
[2:21:57] <DraxTD> ...damn it
[2:21:59] <%Sasquatch_John> @AngriestPat Kiwami 2 is better than this one in every regard
[2:22:02] <+mik255> hers is the shortest section
[2:22:05] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> You can do it! Pure spite is the strongest motivator to finish a game
[2:22:06] <%Mekhet09> You don't have the tools to stream it?
[2:22:07] <SilverFaustX> actually it came out on ps4
[2:22:07] <%Afterman_> i mean if it was on ps5 youi couldnt stream it either atm
[2:22:07] <%Mitalis> I don't understand..... Do you NOT have a PS3?
[2:22:08] <%manwithboxonhead> Ah the DeVito Whorrees.
[2:22:09] <%Tearonex> PS5!?
[2:22:11] <shoobieredgrave> @commanderclaw care to dance? THE FLOOR IS YOURS
[2:22:11] <%Mekhet09> I thought you would.
[2:22:12] <ancrest_tant> I think I struggled through haruka part too
[2:22:12] <ChoculaUltra> @AngriestPat can I pay you to stream the entirety of Xenogears? disc 2 and all?
[2:22:12] <sukiyakiwestern> i heard kiwami 2 was junk
[2:22:13] <ミュウレ4242> there's hardware you can get to stream ps3 games.
[2:22:16] <%bread_assassin> It knee-capped your playthrough for like 4 years, Pat.
[2:22:17] <Josef_Stryker> LUL
[2:22:17] <%WackyXmand> i just watched the Makoto scene from Yakuza Kawami 2 and it destroyed me emotionally
[2:22:17] <%Niney_Who> WHAT
[2:22:19] <%rytyoung> Did Woolie beat Sekiro?
[2:22:19] <$SGrim> IT'S HAPPENING rooPog
[2:22:20] <+Redpointshine> WOAH
[2:22:20] <SilverFaustX> 2 is good
[2:22:20] <Dr_Mooose> SHIT
[2:22:20] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Well then
[2:22:21] <worldbrand> hahahahaha
[2:22:21] <%Deekman> I run Yakuza Fan the struggle to get Yakuza 5 released in the west was the worst
[2:22:21] <ShreddingPixels> OH
[2:22:21] <%Mitalis> It does have HDMI out, shouldn't be an issue to stream
[2:22:21] <+Sulfur_Boride> Time for Chris Redfield's soul to channel
[2:22:22] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[2:22:22] <DraxTD> Kirru sais no
[2:22:23] <dekkitout> The FUCK?!
[2:22:24] <Conky89> When your speech skill is 100

[2:22:26] <%MonsieurHedge> kiryu is a fucking mutant
[2:22:26] <+JackMillerTime> nah this still holds up
[2:22:27] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THAT WAS MARBLE
[2:22:29] <%Niney_Who> "I broke my hand"
[2:22:30] <reonome> HOLY SHIT
[2:22:33] <MarylandJutsu> JEEZUS CHRIST
[2:22:33] <InugamiTheHound> can you strip that out now?
[2:22:36] <alrobot2014> what's hdcp?
[2:22:36] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THAT WAS A MARBLE STATUE
[2:22:37] <%SvenHolgersson> KIRYU ARE U OK
[2:22:38] <%spiritofmojave> MARBLE IS CRASH
[2:22:40] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> IT WAS SOLID STONE
[2:22:41] <VritraReiRei> @FackinCrazy in 5 you can. she's an idol that you do rhythm game stuff with
[2:22:42] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat There's a way around that that isn't illegal and doesn't break anything.
[2:22:44] <dekkitout> "It's fine, she's my sidekick"
[2:22:44] <alexandrecau> Kiryu will take that kid to bed and that's final
[2:22:45] <silverira> that was a family heirloom
[2:22:45] <%brickwall35> NO BULLY
[2:22:47] <+Mittensbro> Can someone get some medical attention for Kiryu's ANNIHILATED FUCKING HAND?!
[2:22:51] <CastellanVon> KIRYU IS UNBREAKABLE
[2:22:53] <%Nedlin> damn
[2:22:53] <natebud> I've definitely seen people stream PS3 before.
[2:22:56] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WHAT
[2:22:59] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat didn't you own a huppage .... you can buypass it via turning off the net on your PS3
[2:22:59] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE FUCK
[2:23:02] <%SvenHolgersson> FUCK EM
[2:23:06] <alexandrecau> plaster statue
[2:23:06] <+Sulfur_Boride> So which is mor impressive? Chris boulder punching, or Kiryu marble punching?
[2:23:08] <frozenottsel> Kiryu trains with Chris
[2:23:08] <Prism_Wing> Makes sense.
[2:23:10] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THE STRONGEREST
[2:23:11] <silverira> but do it tho
[2:23:11] <sukiyakiwestern> yeah, just like persona 5 Kappa
[2:23:13] <fluffypupperino> yakuza 5 took me fucking forever to beat
[2:23:13] <Caidezes> Chat needs to chill.
[2:23:15] <Dao_Puppy> How do these run in rpcs3?
[2:23:16] <%ECRead> fair
[2:23:21] <%Keyd00d> MATTE YO
[2:23:22] <%TeraMercier> With Chris, he was just knocking the boulder off a ledge, not shattering it
[2:23:23] <+mik255> how bout when 5 gets re released?
[2:23:24] <majindusto> JESUS CHRIST PAT
[2:23:26] <%zanzibar_junker> just watch it
[2:23:27] <%Laecerelius> They'll eventually remake it and you can play it on a modern system so whatever
[2:23:29] <+DingusMcFadden> I think rules are made for a reason, and we need to respect that, chat.
[2:23:30] <Prism_Wing> It's pretty convoluted lol.
[2:23:31] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat that's fair enough. If you don't wanna do it you don't wanna do it. And dealing with splitters can get aggravating when they decide to randomly shit the bed.
[2:23:31] <+misterfistor> you can play it on your own, pat. let people experience 5 when its remaster comes out @AngriestPat
[2:23:32] <%mercado94> MATTE YO
[2:23:32] <Ner234> LUL
[2:23:32] <natebud> Does anything run in rpcs3 @Dao_Puppy
[2:23:40] <%BigNerdSam> Just play Kiwami 2, by the time you finish 5 will be out on PS4.
[2:23:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> If it was me I'd totally drop 5 and 6 and just go for Kiwami 2
[2:23:47] <+Brighthawk> Just become a Canadian Yakuza instead
[2:23:49] <Fiend95> Hey lady, don't worry about it
[2:23:51] <Ner234> Kiryu is role model parent
[2:23:52] <dekkitout> Kiryu: "I know it's weird, it's a long story, she's my new sidekick"
[2:23:52] <alexandrecau> I punched the statue therefore the kid watch
[2:23:53] <Dao_Puppy> @natebud I'll have you know I can run demon's souls at a whopping 20 fps!
[2:23:55] <majindusto> PAT IS SUCH A BABY
[2:23:55] <%Niney_Who> (x) doubt
[2:23:56] <ChoculaUltra> Kiwami 2 that litty?
[2:23:58] <FackinCrazy> @VritraReiRei Well fuck guess it was too much to hope you can suplex fools while in idol garb
[2:24:00] <shoobieredgrave> fake fan
[2:24:00] <%greenhathero> i just skipped 5 and played 6
[2:24:04] <c_drolet> I guess pat just doesn’t care about the fans then....
[2:24:06] <%zanzibar_junker> it is
[2:24:10] <Caidezes> 6 isn't that good, sadly.
[2:24:10] <Basch71> why not just play it off stream
[2:24:12] <Prism_Wing> My living room looks like a fucking FBI van because of all the hardware lol.
[2:24:12] <%logoth_> Is Saejima DMX?
[2:24:14] <%TeraMercier> It's like having a save right in the middle of your least favorite section of a game
[2:24:15] <natebud> @Dao_Puppy yeah, that sounds about right.
[2:24:16] <%zanzibar_junker> i love the hunting
[2:24:17] <%mercado94> again??
[2:24:17] <%Das_Bass> you fight a bear
[2:24:18] <%Keyd00d> really wish they'd announce those 3-5 remasters for the west soon
[2:24:19] <%rumtumtugnutz> Kiryu's a sad taxi man
[2:24:20] <+HellCopter> Skip to 6
[2:24:22] <+mik255> trust me it doesnt make sense when you play it anywayu
[2:24:22] <+Sulfur_Boride> Kiryu became a Crazy Taxi driver
[2:24:27] <$Wafflum> A guy betrayed you? In a Yakuza game?!
[2:24:31] <+DingusMcFadden> Sounds awesome, LUL
[2:24:33] <%Laecerelius> Uhhhh
[2:24:33] <+misterfistor> Shimada was the blandest replacement and weirdest fighting style :c
[2:24:34] <natebud> I see you brought a child. KINKY
[2:24:35] <SilverFaustX> kiwami 5 is out in june
[2:24:38] <%zanzibar_junker> pat saejima voices takemura in ippo
[2:24:42] <+reddpop_> Pat stop playing games that make you miserable
[2:24:42] <VritraReiRei> @FackinCrazy there's videos of people replacing Kiryu's model with Haruka so you can watch her do heat moves to people
[2:24:42] <+RowenCleric> Saejima will always go back to jail
[2:24:44] <shoobieredgrave> @AngriestPat 6 actually plays a lot off of 5 so good luck with that
[2:24:44] <%radda343> she didn't even question why he brought a child
[2:24:44] <CastellanVon> No reaction to the child
[2:24:46] <%Reizie_Etherealm> BARE FEET
[2:24:46] <joneworldbeater> @AngriestPat Any plans to play 6?
[2:24:47] <%zanzibar_junker> both kill bears
[2:24:48] <MarylandJutsu> Shinji is dead. He died while I was out doing SIDE QUESTS
[2:24:48] <Dr_Mooose> this place is fancy
[2:24:48] <MelancholicMasochist> I wish akiyama would have become the new protag
[2:24:49] <ChoculaUltra> its eerie how chill Akemi is with Erika in the room. Like no questions asked.
[2:24:50] <$RubberFistFight> @Prism_Wing yeah my "streaming closet" is just a fucking rats nest of wires going into and out of things, partially because of my brain goblins demanding a specific sound setup.
[2:24:51] <%Laecerelius> She didn't fucking question him bringing in a child?!
[2:24:52] <mayorrev> ew feet
[2:24:54] <fluffypupperino> i forget, why the hell did he bring haruka to a hoower house?
[2:25:01] <%Deekman> There’s an HD remaster of 5 hopefully coming to ps4
[2:25:03] <MelancholicMasochist> akiyama is my fav
[2:25:04] <alexandrecau> He died while I was being named dILF
[2:25:11] <SilverFaustX> crayon shin chan
[2:25:12] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, I felt like Akiyama could have carried a whole game himself
[2:25:19] <+DingusMcFadden> Have you ever beat up a bunch of thugs while on fire in real life, @AngriestPat ?
[2:25:19] <%Deekman> It’s out in japan in a few weeks. 4K. 60 FPS
[2:25:23] <%logoth_> Crayon Shin Chan died as he lived. Murdered by mobsters
[2:25:30] <mayorrev> SNOKING IS BAD
[2:25:30] <%mastertwin2> "When I die, some big angry Yakuzaman is gonna find you and punch everything"
[2:25:33] <Prism_Wing> @rubberfistfight Hopefully Stadia will save us Kappa
[2:25:34] <Dr_Mooose> where?
[2:25:35] <BigCoffee> I have a hard time playing yakuza games because of how sad everyone is, and how Kyriu loses all of his friends
[2:25:37] <+DingusMcFadden> Kaz is always smelling farts
[2:25:38] <%zanzibar_junker> kiryu's va's favorite game is Yakuza 3
[2:25:39] <%ALTRNico> SMOKING BAD
[2:25:39] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> "Sorry, I couldn't save Shinji because I was busy winning a DILF contest"
[2:25:40] <%TeraMercier> @fluffypupperino There's actually no stated reason if memory serves, she just comes along so that she can't get kidnapped off screen again
[2:25:41] <DarkOmen98> where did she get those smokes?
[2:25:43] <%mercado94> not as bad as DRUGS
[2:25:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Reizie_Etherealm) (warning)
[2:25:46] <CastellanVon> "Shinji Died but I have the title of Number one DILF and Bad Ass Dads".
[2:25:46] <SilverFaustX> i hate ppl that smoke next to a kid
[2:25:47] <%SvenHolgersson> Haruka bout to beat some ass
[2:25:47] <DarkOmen98> her nighty has no pockets
[2:25:47] <GhostLanterns> where did she even get those from
[2:25:49] <%Laecerelius> This is no DMC5 i'll tell you what
[2:25:51] <mayorrev> Nero would kick her ass
[2:25:51] <Ner234> Haruka has seen some shit. What a tough kid. LUL
[2:25:53] <Conky89> Smoking is considered cool in Japan though
[2:25:53] <%JohnElwaysTeeth> this game DOES promote the act of smoking
[2:25:54] <Basch71> as long its not cocaine
[2:25:54] <$RubberFistFight> @DingusMcFadden he cowered naked in the bathroom hiding from a can-munching house centipede, that's the same thing, right? Kappa
[2:25:55] <MelancholicMasochist> He totally could have
[2:25:58] <$SGrim> @DarkOmen98 cooter cigs rooKek
[2:25:59] <$Wafflum> The Japanese actually are powered by cigarettes.
[2:26:00] <SilverInferno3> "Nature's pocket"
[2:26:05] <%Deekman> Women have more hiding places than men
[2:26:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> I have come to give you this girl child to raise in your ways.
[2:26:07] <+BaekTheHeck> terada... yup totally on your side...
[2:26:08] <%Laecerelius> You're the ultimate DILF!
[2:26:08] <%spiritofmojave> Japan thinks drugs are bad, but nicotine isn't a drug it's a chemical Kappa
[2:26:10] <Caidezes> Yes you are Pat.
[2:26:16] <Fiend95> All women have at least one pocket at all times Kappa
[2:26:18] <%Reizie_Etherealm> I believe the term is BAD
[2:26:22] <natebud> @Deekman they have longer hair Kappa
[2:26:24] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He nap apatBlep

[2:26:31] <DraxTD> news at 11
[2:26:32] <Wan6Saber> @Fiend95 athLH
[2:26:37] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat what was your opinion of Shinada, that weapon master replacement guy for Tanimura in 5?
[2:26:39] <SilverFaustX> kiryu chan
[2:26:40] <%ALTRNico> monkaS
[2:26:40] <ShichiNoBushi> You're alive!!
[2:26:41] <+DingusMcFadden> @RubberFistFight I dunno, let me think ... Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2:26:45] <%Radregice_> my man
[2:26:46] <st_jimmy456> perfectly fine
[2:26:48] <%logoth_> ORAA! Sorraahhh! Orr-r-r--ra!
[2:26:48] <%SvenHolgersson> BEEP BEEP
[2:26:51] <natebud> beep bep
[2:26:51] <%rumtumtugnutz> majima get
[2:26:51] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Majima please
[2:26:53] <%MightyMaxT> DORIYAAA
[2:26:55] <%Reizie_Etherealm> She doesn't seem that shaken from hearing about her SO's death
[2:26:56] <dekkitout> "Special Delivery"
[2:26:56] <CastellanVon> LETS FUCK THIS SHIT UP
[2:26:59] <Fiend95> Majima the fuck
[2:27:01] <joneworldbeater> Now the REAL hero arrives
[2:27:02] <Prism_Wing> Look at this alive ass mofo over here LUL
[2:27:02] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat So remember that Majima got stabbed after the 1st canon fight? Well, the bandages were on him for that originally, but with the Majima Everywhere system still being active after the 1st fight... And that's why that new sequence was added.
[2:27:03] <+mik255> man retconning majima is the weirdest
[2:27:03] <%Tearonex> HE SURVIVED!?
[2:27:05] <RealPT1> dammit majima
[2:27:06] <%spiritofmojave> Reminder he does this after RECOVERING from a gut wound
[2:27:06] <%rumtumtugnutz> beepu beepu I'm a jeepu
[2:27:06] <%Laecerelius> Majima the Ultimate Lifeform!
[2:27:08] <frozenottsel> nani the fuck?
[2:27:10] <Desertfishing> damn pat spoilers Kappa
[2:27:12] <ooblag> Majima was also still fucked up from getting shot at the batting cages
[2:27:16] <%Radregice_> majima everywhere just screwed with this games story real bad
[2:27:25] <%psychocalibur> LEt's all go to the lobby
[2:27:31] <%rumtumtugnutz> Majima died about a hundred times in Kiwami.
[2:27:36] <+Redpointshine> That dude bounced
[2:27:39] <+DingusMcFadden> Beast it my favorite style. Slow, but so much utility
[2:27:43] <Fiend95> That man in the back is so ready
[2:27:44] <+Sulfur_Boride> So was the Majima Everywhere system worth messing with the game's canon?
[2:27:47] <majindusto> "stabbed" at the batting cages
[2:27:50] <%Dagman72> apatFist apatFist apatFist
[2:27:51] <%Deekman> FUCK YEAH Just beat the twin Apes in Sekiro first try! Pat you’re my good luck charm lol
[2:27:53] <%rumtumtugnutz> @psychocalibur Which one of these guys is the snack?
[2:27:55] <CopperTucker> of course it was
[2:27:56] <+mik255> i love the long fights
[2:27:59] <ooblag> The MES is the most fun part of Kiwami
[2:28:01] <InugamiTheHound> who was shin-chan?Was he that guy died on the roof with that one chick who betrayed you?
[2:28:02] <%rumtumtugnutz> Blonde douche?
[2:28:02] <%Laecerelius> He's got his loveseat, ready to fucking swing away!
[2:28:08] <fruit_pie_the_magician> The ass buster is the best. Beast style, grab, turn him around with L1, and profit
[2:28:12] <Wan6Saber> junkersREKT
[2:28:12] <%mastertwin2> Is there a way to disable Majima Everywhere (TM) to help continuity?
[2:28:13] <%logoth_> This guy's plan is to stand in a hallway holding a COUCH??
[2:28:15] <%rumtumtugnutz> Chubby pompadouche?
[2:28:16] <dekkitout> That move is cool has heck
[2:28:18] <Saltmeisterr> nice
[2:28:21] <SilverFaustX> no
[2:28:23] <%radda343> what was that guy's plan? why did he just stand there with the couch?
[2:28:24] <majindusto> Nope
[2:28:26] <%Radregice_> @mastertwin2 nope
[2:28:28] <%TeraMercier> I don't think there's any disabling of Majima everywhere
[2:28:30] <%tizz86> @angriestpat you can probably swap out the trouble finder for the beast amulet and trivialize this section
[2:28:33] <$Wafflum> Kiwami 2 doesn't give you a heat move for killing sofa guys, it fucking sucks
[2:28:33] <ミュウレ4242> this game's story barely existed, though. majima everywhere responded to fan demands for more majima sarcastically, which is pretty funny.
[2:28:35] <%wsintai> @mastertwin2 Majima is stronger than continuity, it cant hold him back
[2:28:37] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Poor dude just wanted to show that he was strong enough to pick up a couch
[2:28:40] <%Radregice_> you can never destroy majima
[2:28:42] <SilverInferno3> @mastertwin2 The Majima System gives you skills so you dont wanna do that
[2:28:47] <%Deekman> Those couch guys are rough without a heat action to help
[2:28:49] <Prism_Wing> This Megaman X ass music!
[2:28:49] <ooblag> Beast is bad for "levels" because you walk so damn slow
[2:28:52] <%ALTRNico> Does Pat not have charge attacks or he just doesn't do it?
[2:28:53] <Ner234> Majima is ETERNAL
[2:28:55] <%TeraMercier> I feel like a lot of the best music tracks in these series is remixes of a couple tracks
[2:28:55] <%mastertwin2> Well that's a shame
[2:28:57] <%rumtumtugnutz> Majima is just Mr Shakedown.
[2:29:03] <%MightyMaxT> Could a Yakuza-styled DMC game work? Like Yakuza side quests but DMC Combat?
[2:29:04] <%mastertwin2> At least we get Goromi-chan though
[2:29:07] <natebud> Sledgehammer!
[2:29:07] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't forget you were bowling nonchalantly not too long ago
[2:29:10] <%Laecerelius> Look at that Shakedown wannabe!
[2:29:13] <%rumtumtugnutz> Except in my experience it was nearly impossible to NOT beat Majima.
[2:29:14] <%Radregice_> kiryu just fucking killed that guy
[2:29:14] <+mr_whet_faartz> you the HHH
[2:29:15] <Lokito3o5> and he's dead
[2:29:16] <+mjkenney24> jesus
[2:29:17] <Turtleomertle> DEAD
[2:29:17] <%Laecerelius> OOOOH!
[2:29:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that guy's dead.
[2:29:18] <ooblag> NEVER
[2:29:18] <SilverInferno3> HIS RIBS ARE SHATTERED
[2:29:18] <%castcode> he's fine
[2:29:19] <dekkitout> Ho Ho Ho Now I have a sledgehammer
[2:29:19] <ooblag> KILLED
[2:29:19] <%El_Desperad0> @ミュウレ4242 that's a lot of bs
[2:29:20] <VritraReiRei> DEAD
[2:29:21] <%TeraMercier> I never really bothered with charge attacks, I felt like I just always got hit
[2:29:21] <ooblag> ANYONE
[2:29:21] <%radda343> imagine if triple h just murdered people with his sledge
[2:29:21] <%Laecerelius> YOU MURDERED HIM!!
[2:29:22] <natebud> No Kiryu that's too much
[2:29:23] <ミュウレ4242> he didn't need ribs anyway.
[2:29:24] <$RubberFistFight> lol that fucken dude coming at you in a tracksuit jacket, what a chump
[2:29:24] <CastellanVon> FUCKING DEAD
[2:29:25] <%zanzibar_junker> fuck
[2:29:25] <InugamiTheHound> Kiryu never killed anyone!
[2:29:25] <%MoraMiarty> dude just stay down
[2:29:25] <OkoPoko> He is literally dead
[2:29:28] <%Deekman> Hammer to the head did less damage than to the ribs
[2:29:28] <madogod> that guy super dead
[2:29:29] <frozenottsel> totally okay tho
[2:29:29] <Ner234> ACTUALLY Dead
[2:29:29] <+DingusMcFadden> When it goes from crime melodrama to crazy-fun time drematic beat em up?
[2:29:31] <%Tearonex> HAS NEVER KILLED ANYONE
[2:29:33] <$RubberFistFight> "I"mma get you with my ADIDAS"
[2:29:34] <Fiend95> Jesus Christ
[2:29:36] <NickHatesSnow> Hes not dead if Kiryu did it
[2:29:37] <Admiral_PopnFresh> octoMYGOD fucking dead
[2:29:37] <+BaekTheHeck> kiryu doesnt kill
[2:29:38] <%ALTRNico> GUN ACQUIRED
[2:29:38] <Prism_Wing> Imagine being fucking DEAD like that guy
[2:29:41] <%DevTheKiller> Jesus he's dead
[2:29:45] <fruit_pie_the_magician> KILL HiM IN THE DICK
[2:29:47] <Conky89> kiryu just broke a freaking sledge hammer...
[2:29:47] <%SvenHolgersson> INJURED
[2:29:48] <%Radregice_> what's the consensus on whether or not kiryu killed that guy when he used him as a human shield
[2:29:51] <Dr_Mooose> knocked out by the bullets
[2:29:53] <%SvenHolgersson> HE'S INJURED
[2:29:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> NONLETHALLY
[2:29:54] <%Tearonex> NOT DEAD
[2:29:55] <%mastertwin2> Garl Vinland over here
[2:29:56] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Kiryu would never shoot a man with a gun
[2:29:56] <%TeraMercier> I feel like people in this game only die from the shame of admitting defeat
[2:29:59] <SilverInferno3> @DingusMcFadden The first game is more the former than the latter, the sidequests are more in line with the campier current games
[2:30:00] <ooblag> At least
[2:30:01] <%brickwall35> you can't kill someone with a cushion it's impossible
[2:30:01] <%spiritofmojave> The couch is made of rubber bullets
[2:30:02] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Those were leg shots
[2:30:03] <%radda343> kiryu didn't kill him, the bullets killed him
[2:30:03] <DraxTD> yep
[2:30:03] <+DingusMcFadden> I was able to non-leathally cave his head in with a chair
[2:30:04] <ketchuo13> No?
[2:30:06] <%TeraMercier> IT was ONLY four years ago?
[2:30:06] <shackbox> DON'T LET IT SET IN PAT
[2:30:07] <fruit_pie_the_magician> yes
[2:30:07] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat yes pat, you're an old man now
[2:30:07] <DraxTD> get to work pat
[2:30:10] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat What do you think, Pat? Was the Majima Everywhere System worth messing with this game's canon?
[2:30:11] <Basch71> yes
[2:30:12] <CrowbarFacelift> December 2015 in the west
[2:30:12] <TheBlankAce> Yeah
[2:30:14] <DraxTD> or wait for PS4/5 version
[2:30:17] <shackbox> DON'T LET IT SET IN
[2:30:18] <Lokito3o5> wut
[2:30:20] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Majima! No!
[2:30:24] <natebud> san Kappa

[2:30:28] <%BigNerdSam> @angriestpat LET lT SET lN
[2:30:28] <@commanderclaw> @AngriestPat Yakuza 5 came out in December 2015
[2:30:28] <T_Sasquatch> @MightyMaxT well it would be a completely different game
[2:30:28] <+mik255> majima is bipolar
[2:30:29] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Are you really though...?
[2:30:30] <InugamiTheHound> yakuza 5 came out in 2012
[2:30:31] <alexandrecau> nope same as original
[2:30:32] <%El_Desperad0> "personality shift" did you even play 0?
[2:30:36] <%Deekman> 7 years ago if you count the Japanese release
[2:30:42] <DraxTD> @shackbox oh no time is an existant thing?!
[2:30:44] <MarylandJutsu> MAJIMA NO
[2:30:47] <%cherubs_anonymous> EHHHH
[2:30:48] <ketchuo13> But Majima has a reason tho
[2:30:52] <%Reizie_Etherealm> That's not the sharp edge of the blade though lol
[2:30:53] <GMN1> REJECTED
[2:30:55] <fruit_pie_the_magician> It's 2019
[2:30:56] <%manwithboxonhead> Waifu NOOO!!
[2:30:57] <+Redpointshine> Wow this is fuckin,, SUPER not the Majima I remember
[2:31:02] <natebud> Glad we brought Haruka.
[2:31:08] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, why is he even bothering with this show
[2:31:11] <rubbishbinge> wat a hero
[2:31:14] <mayorrev> ????
[2:31:15] <Fiend95> Majima respects women
[2:31:16] <Dr_Mooose> oh
[2:31:17] <VritraReiRei> @AngriestPat December 8, 2015 was the WW release date. at the current rate, the remastered version will have come at by the end of the year! :D
[2:31:17] <dekkitout> Haruka's face is yelling "What the hell is even going on anymore?"
[2:31:17] <%spiritofmojave> ??? LUL
[2:31:18] <CrowbarFacelift> this guy
[2:31:18] <%mercado94> what a hero
[2:31:20] <%waifoong98> Majima doesn't support NTR LUL
[2:31:20] <reonome> fuckin majima
[2:31:20] <Admiral_PopnFresh> He just had a Punisher esque flashback to Makoto
[2:31:20] <ketchuo13> Majima did nothing wrong
[2:31:22] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ?????????
[2:31:22] <mayorrev> resPECT WOMEN
[2:31:23] <+Quigsies> Oh that cooky Majima!
[2:31:25] <%castcode> BIG HERO
[2:31:25] <%Tucker0603> HE'S THE BEST
[2:31:25] <GMN1> what a fucking hero
[2:31:26] <+gambit_gamble> Majma always rejected
[2:31:26] <Conky89> from 60 down to zero
[2:31:27] <%ThatGuyfromMars> majima is weird.
[2:31:28] <%manwithboxonhead> We’re cool
[2:31:29] <%mastertwin2> REDEEMED
[2:31:30] <SomersaultJustice> most honorable majima
[2:31:30] <ooblag> Majima the feminist
[2:31:30] <$RubberFistFight> oh man i was half expecting that knife to go in her back and come out the front
[2:31:31] <%TeraMercier> All it took was Kiryu saying he didn't like that
[2:31:31] <%Radregice_> no one respects women more than kiryu and majima
[2:31:31] <%brickwall35> m'lady
[2:31:33] <%Laecerelius> NOTHING IS MORE BADASS THAN RESPECTING A WoMAN!!
[2:31:34] <frozenottsel> so he's cool then?
[2:31:35] <ミュウレ4242> and now, the goku vs king piccolo fight, w/ gangsters.
[2:31:37] <nawleenspoboy> i bet majima is into some super weird shit SoonerLater SoonerLater
[2:31:37] <$RubberFistFight> this crazy bastard
[2:31:38] <%gambit_gamble> gambit_gamble subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[2:31:38] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> IT WAS AN HONESTY TEST
[2:31:40] <%logoth_> It sfine
[2:31:42] <%Deekman> Majima says: Respecting women is cool
[2:31:42] <%BigNerdSam> Respecc vvomen
[2:31:43] <KeiPrime> majima respects honesty
[2:31:46] <%brickwall35> only pussies die from bullet wounds
[2:31:46] <Caidezes> He's totally faking being crazy though.
[2:31:46] <Ner234> It's fine tho
[2:31:47] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Makoto-chan octoSad
[2:31:47] <%spiritofmojave> The bandage is still freshly on LUL
[2:31:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Yakuza 5 came out in Japan in 2012
[2:31:48] <%logoth_> He walked it off
[2:31:54] <reonome> just a flesh wound
[2:31:56] <CastellanVon> Bullets mean nothing in Yakuza
[2:31:56] <natebud> I beat you at bowling Majima, this fight means nothing to me
[2:31:57] <%Radregice_> he's talking about the actual canon part where he gets stabbed
[2:31:58] <%manwithboxonhead> Remember you don’t need to smoke and drink to be cool.
[2:31:59] <Basch71> he got stabbed too initially
[2:32:02] <+DingusMcFadden> Majima respects well maintained bangs
[2:32:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> And it was released in North America as a download only game in 2015
[2:32:05] <Crankthulhu> Why is Majima holding a lightsaber?
[2:32:07] <+HellCopter> These fights have way less impact when its the 7,000th time you fight him
[2:32:07] <ChoculaUltra> lmao, as if Kiryu didn't eat 40 clips to the dick in that fight
[2:32:08] <ketchuo13> Considering you beat his ass like alot in this game. I think Majima can take a bullet
[2:32:12] <$RubberFistFight> oh shit he put divine confetti on his knife.
[2:32:12] <sukiyakiwestern> doesnt it get annoying fighting majima over and over again
[2:32:13] <dekkitout> "Majima, you got thrown into a volcano..."
[2:32:14] <%TeraMercier> I was astounded at Kiryu literally healing over from being shot three times within like 6 hours in 0
[2:32:17] <Josef_Stryker> ORAORAORA
[2:32:17] <%GarbageNirvana> I mean is he faking it though? He went through some serious shit in 0 and it could be he decided to stop holding everything back
[2:32:22] <%brickwall35> ORA ORA ORA ORA
[2:32:23] <%ALTRNico> ARA ARA
[2:32:25] <$RubberFistFight> Kiryu is an apparition confirmed.
[2:32:26] <sukiyakiwestern> majima everywhere is s funny kome but goddamn
[2:32:26] <alexandrecau> the bullet hit the stab wound so nothing that wasn't worthless got lost
[2:32:26] <%Tearonex> this music is RAD
[2:32:26] <DraxTD> krunkOra krunkOra krunkOra
[2:32:27] <%radda343> ORA ORA ORA
[2:32:29] <%Radregice_> kiwami means extreme
[2:32:30] <%gambit_gamble> ora ora ora
[2:32:30] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Nugget saved Yakuza
[2:32:30] <+DingusMcFadden> SHouldn't that heal him?
[2:32:31] <FackinCrazy> The Majima everywhere system was fun for like 5 hours then it became such a chore that its no wonder it was removed from kiwami 2
[2:32:32] <%logoth_> What is it with Japan and "DADADADA" and "oraoraora"
[2:32:33] <+Redpointshine> The music for this fight is actually really good
[2:32:34] <MarylandJutsu> JOOJOOOOOOO
[2:32:36] <CrowbarFacelift> he loves it
[2:32:40] <mayorrev> NOW I'M MOTIVATED
[2:32:40] <%AncelDeLambert> I'm sorry WHAT
[2:32:42] <%Niney_Who> YOOO
[2:32:42] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> WHAT
[2:32:42] <%brickwall35> YOOOO
[2:32:43] <%DarkSideCow> probably my favorite part in this game
[2:32:43] <Ner234> WHAT
[2:32:44] <%Keyd00d> HOW
[2:32:44] <Prism_Wing> He's using his constant post-damage invincibility frames to skip the pain Kappa
[2:32:45] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> Holy shit Majima
[2:32:46] <+JackMillerTime> man im gonna find that snakeskin jacket one day
[2:32:46] <T_Sasquatch> YEYEYEYEY
[2:32:47] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> THIS IS JUST GOD OF WAR
[2:32:47] <+Ryutaryi> WHAT
[2:32:48] <Dr_Mooose> YOOOO PogChamp
[2:32:49] <Them00n> WHAT
[2:32:49] <Ner234> EXCUSE ME
[2:32:50] <alexandrecau> awano taught him that
[2:32:51] <%Laecerelius> What is this POWER?!
[2:32:51] <%MightyMaxT> Man, I wanna get Yakuza 6 because it has Virtua Fighter 5 and NJPW characters, but I'm afraid of starting at number 6
[2:32:51] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Imagine if Majima has that counter stab move Pat keeps using in 0 and insta kills Kiryu in one it lol
[2:32:52] <%spiritofmojave> STUPID SHIT COMING UP
[2:32:52] <%Tucker0603> THAT'S RAD
[2:32:52] <%TeraMercier> It also woulda been really overplayed to have the same Majima everywhere in K2
[2:32:52] <Conky89> Majima you freaking monster!
[2:32:53] <%Idziman> THIS IS JOJO
[2:32:53] <dekkitout> WHAT THE HELL?
[2:32:53] <SilverFaustX> punch the floor
[2:32:53] <%Tearonex> WHAAAAAAAAAAAA
[2:32:54] <%AncelDeLambert> What is this Yu Yu Hakusho shit?
[2:32:54] <official_nakmatic> Is Majima just a heel that likes to fuck with you from time to time?
[2:32:55] <ooblag> Majima JUST DESTROYED THE FLOOR by punching it
[2:32:55] <%SvenHolgersson> ARRIVEDERCI
[2:32:58] <CastellanVon> MAJIMA WHAT
[2:33:01] <+mik255> is majima a virfil?
[2:33:02] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, see? You healed him Kaz, you idiot
[2:33:04] <+Ryutaryi> How can anyone say this game is disappointing when that happened?
[2:33:07] <GundamF91> I think the Majima Everywhere makes his story fights less meangingful
[2:33:08] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> He just fucking Ora'd Kiryu through a concrete floor
[2:33:10] <%AncelDeLambert> Majima is a Toguro
[2:33:11] <CrowbarFacelift> There was also those other few dozens times though
[2:33:16] <%MonsieurHedge> majima is ABSOLUTELY a birgil
[2:33:18] <+DingusMcFadden> Damnit
[2:33:20] <%brickwall35> ORA ORA ORA
[2:33:21] <%Laecerelius> Majima is totally Kiryu's Vergil
[2:33:26] <$RubberFistFight> @GundamF91 the "majima everywhere" system, i love it
[2:33:27] <%TeraMercier> At this point fighting majima is just "how many times do I gotta teach you this lesson old man"
[2:33:28] <SilverInferno3> Yeah he loses his threat level from how many times you fight him
[2:33:29] <%Radregice_> can't believe kiryu learned how to juggle enemies
[2:33:30] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He Birkined you
[2:33:31] <Mr_Strut> Pat better not die now
[2:33:36] <%Reizie_Etherealm> We must've fought a thousand times~!
[2:33:36] <Dao_Puppy> Did Majima ever appear during a MAjima boss fight? I want that.
[2:33:38] <Mr_Strut> That would be really embarrassing
[2:33:43] <%TeraMercier> Yeah, he's a Virgil for Kiryu that is clearly and definitely weaker
[2:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> what just dropped on the floor?
[2:33:46] <Wan6Saber> Majima is a annoying character, especially in recent games
[2:33:47] <LixFury> No majima is Kiryus Dante LUL
[2:33:47] <alexandrecau> he already lost his threat by being in like all the other games
[2:33:48] <%AncelDeLambert> oh
[2:33:48] <%Edgy_Macaroon> fighting majima never gets old
[2:33:48] <%El_Desperad0> You almost died every time
[2:33:49] <+Sulfur_Boride> Wouldn't it be more accurate if Kiryu was Vergil, and Majima is Dante?
[2:33:50] <Prism_Wing> @radregice_ Proof he should be in Tekken
[2:33:51] <%zanzibar_junker> yakuza 6 has korean vergil
[2:33:54] <%AncelDeLambert> OW
[2:34:00] <Ner234> OUCH
[2:34:01] <$RubberFistFight> @Dao_Puppy i'm pretty sure if we panned over to a corner, we'd see Majima leering out from behind some rubble.
[2:34:04] <Conky89> defeating a Majima only makes it stronger. fact.
[2:34:04] <ミュウレ4242> but he's on the clock this time, using the mad dog style.
[2:34:04] <DraxTD> @Laecerelius I thikn you mean Majima is Kiru's Dante as Kiru is way too Virgil
[2:34:06] <%SvenHolgersson> Jesus he's fast
[2:34:07] <%brickwall35> ORA ORA ORA ORA ORA
[2:34:09] <+mik255> majima just gets more absurd every game
[2:34:12] <+DingusMcFadden> That's obvious Crazy Diomond's fist barrage, chat, not Star Platinum's
[2:34:14] <dero45> No Kiryu is Majimas dio
[2:34:14] <T_Sasquatch> majima drives a fucking truck through shangri la , the time for logic was out of the window
[2:34:15] <%logoth_> I hope you like that animation!
[2:34:25] <natebud> majima shows up way to often to be Virgil. he's like Phantom at this point.
[2:34:25] <+reddpop_> I never thought Pat could have so little fun playing Yakuza
[2:34:29] <$RubberFistFight> Majima is like an anti-Shaggy
[2:34:30] <%wsintai> @AngriestPat Majima is like Mr. X; there's more than 1 always after you
[2:34:33] <Admiral_PopnFresh> the lighting in this fight is pretty cool
[2:34:34] <%Sycada> Vergil everywhere system. Thoughts?
[2:34:35] <Dao_Puppy> ...hehe, he starts passing himself knives.
[2:34:38] <+Quigsies> It almost looks cel shaded in the shadows, looks cool
[2:34:41] <$RubberFistFight> each Majima you fight is but an avatar, one part of an infinite whole.
[2:34:42] <%korth367> @AngriestPat thoughts on a dmc1 or 3 remake with a virgil everywhere system
[2:34:48] <%Reizie_Etherealm> @Sycada YES
[2:34:52] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat did you like that Shinada guy from 5 who replaced Tanimura?
[2:34:53] <%TeraMercier> There's an "everyone is VIrgil" mod for PC
[2:34:55] <+Sulfur_Boride> Man, them glowing with aura in the dark is so fuckin sick
[2:34:55] <%Mekhet09> Be thankful for that.
[2:35:02] <%bread_assassin> Well, he did get shot.
[2:35:02] <+mik255> @logoth_ ill take that animation over the grapple finisher in 3
[2:35:04] <MelancholicMasochist> its cause of the bullet
[2:35:06] <+DingusMcFadden> You were WAY tougher that time you were everywhere
[2:35:10] <%wsintai> @korth367 Wake me up when we get Vergil everywhere in dmc2
[2:35:14] <%Radregice_> majima has the power that vergil wants
[2:35:15] <+Sulfur_Boride> @AngriestPat So the bandages were originally for the stab after the 1st fight, but in this game, the Majima Everywhere system was still active after the 1st fight, and so the dock scene was added to justify the bandages this time.
[2:35:16] <DraxTD> AaaaaaaaaaaaaKiama
[2:35:20] <MelancholicMasochist> akiyama the coolest
[2:35:24] <%logoth_> Does Kage have a shirt yet
[2:35:27] <%logoth_> somebody tell kage to put on a shirt
[2:35:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> never
[2:35:32] <SilverInferno3> A Vergil Everywhere system would honestly ruin Vergil
[2:35:33] <T_Sasquatch> LUL
[2:35:35] <majindusto> No
[2:35:36] <%Radregice_> why should he
[2:35:36] <+BaekTheHeck> akiyama is good kicky boi
[2:35:37] <%bread_assassin> If you're past Haruka's section, then. What's killing the game for you, now?
[2:35:47] <+mik255> it might have been easier to take out the bandages
[2:35:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> he has to have the dad bod out 24/7
[2:35:52] <%TeraMercier> Why did they even bother to justify his bandages, Majima everywhere is so ridculous anyway
[2:35:53] <Mr_Strut> A dante everywhere system for Nero might work
[2:35:54] <+DingusMcFadden> He'll never catch Lupin with that attitude
[2:35:55] <godzookylives> Policeman Vergil
[2:35:55] <%spiritofmojave> DILF on duty
[2:36:01] <$RubberFistFight> I haven't been keeping up with this game but I'm assuming that guy is a cop, because he is wearing "standard japanese copman" outfit.
[2:36:02] <%Radregice_> oh god i forgot about jingu
[2:36:03] <%zanzibar_junker> lo
[2:36:09] <majindusto> JUST HOOK IT UP
[2:36:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @RubberFistFight he is
[2:36:18] <%tizz86> and the controller
[2:36:18] <+Sulfur_Boride> If DMC 6 comes out. Vergil would honestly be to Dante as Kuze was to Kiryu in 0 at this point in DMC's story.
[2:36:19] <DraxTD> Take your medicin @AngriestPat
[2:36:19] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Just skip it
[2:36:19] <MelancholicMasochist> it is
[2:36:22] <%TeraMercier> Precisely. Fuck setting up a whole console instead of just playing something readily available
[2:36:22] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Dude hooking up a ps3 is literally two cords
[2:36:23] <MelancholicMasochist> but you gotta
[2:36:25] <%WackyXmand> i think it came out recently for PS4
[2:36:27] <+DingusMcFadden> Pat's one weakness... unplugged obsolete consoles
[2:36:28] <%CaptainTubaki> its really not lol
[2:36:29] <RadSuit> He says, while playing a PS2 game.
[2:36:32] <%mastertwin2> Majima Everywhere is such a great addition, but it really should have been added as like an optional or a NG+ mode
[2:36:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You don't have to
[2:36:33] <Basch71> not really
[2:36:34] <Them00n> Pat you are beyond help.
[2:36:36] <SuperCreeperBlocks> Just wait for the remasters
[2:36:37] <majindusto> FAKE YAKUZA FAN
[2:36:38] <%Niney_Who> He says having played every DMC Game
[2:36:38] <VritraReiRei> yet you'll play Bloodlines which is a PS2 GAME LUL
[2:36:41] <Admiral_PopnFresh> I play PS2 games all the time
[2:36:48] <Mnightshyamallama> he says that as i play smt3 on my ps3
[2:36:50] <fruit_pie_the_magician> At least one of which is interchangable with ps4
[2:36:51] <%castcode> Pat u ok
[2:36:55] <SilverInferno3> @Mr_Strut Yeah that'd be better, Dante seems more the type to come in randomly and test your skills
[2:36:55] <%CaptainTubaki> your a psycho
[2:36:57] <FackinCrazy> @AngriestPat Its weird huh? I totally thought last gen games were gonna age way better then they did
[2:37:00] <%TheSniperJoe> "Because I was sick." Coulda just left it at that.
[2:37:01] <yourliteraldog> first worldproblems
[2:37:02] <$RubberFistFight> @ThatGuyfromMars "How do we tell the audience this guy is a po-lees? I know, we give him a blue striped tie and a light tang longcoat! IT'S PERFECT!"
[2:37:03] <DraxTD> suck it up Pat.. it's ONE game
[2:37:03] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@T_Sasquatch) (warning)
[2:37:03] <%TeraMercier> I was actually always super disappointed that all the costume unlockables in these were NG+ only, I never got to see them
[2:37:03] <Admiral_PopnFresh> BabyRage
[2:37:04] <SailingSaturn> oh Pat's a snob cirISee
[2:37:04] <%Keyd00d> Okay weirdo
[2:37:04] <$RubberFistFight> to be fair it works.
[2:37:05] <%CaptainTubaki> you need help pat lol
[2:37:06] <%Radregice_> he needs the big number
[2:37:11] <%PlainSimpleTailor> First World Problems
[2:37:12] <Conky89> damn and here I have with 1080p at best on my poor mans rig
[2:37:13] <majindusto> CRAZIEST PAT
[2:37:13] <+DingusMcFadden> Oooh, 4K, look at the pants on Mr. Fancy-Pat
[2:37:13] <jossahmol> fwp
[2:37:15] <%Tucker0603> well that's your Goblins fault
[2:37:16] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @RubberFistFight he's got a gun somewhere too
[2:37:17] <%manwithboxonhead> Oh no
[2:37:19] <%spiritofmojave> It's true, Bloodlines is Deus Ex levels of polygonal
[2:37:20] <%Radregice_> he NEEDS the big number
[2:37:21] <T_Sasquatch> You are LITERALLY playing BLOODLINES
[2:37:30] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Don't use the PC master race as a reason for not going back come on now
[2:37:35] <%El_Desperad0> Anything to avoid Yakoozies
[2:37:41] <ミュウレ4242> what all you you have that uses 4k?
[2:37:42] <RadSuit> Does it though?
[2:37:42] <MoroseLoki> What pat is hella normal
[2:37:42] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @RubberFistFight like, an actual gun, not those makarov knockoffs the yakoozies have
[2:37:42] <fruit_pie_the_magician> IT DOES NOT
[2:37:46] <+misterfistor> @AngriestPat if i have a 1080, is it worth it to upgrade to a 2080 or 2080 TI?
[2:37:49] <%manwithboxonhead> Graphics are not everything.
[2:37:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> CaptainPileDriver subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 27 months! yeah, 27 months, i'm gonna be here forever. also, i really love kiwami and i did beat it, but fuck some of these end game bosses.
[2:37:52] <natebud> Agreed. I can play old ugly games as long as they're at least sharp, slighly blurry PS3 games are awful
[2:37:54] <yourliteraldog> Isn't anything above 1440p non distinguishable to the human eye?
[2:37:58] <%TeraMercier> It's also a totally new kind of experience, instead of a new story skin on similar gameplay
[2:37:58] <%PlainSimpleTailor> 4K Look at my amazing e peen and my smooth, luxurious e scrote hairs
[2:37:59] <%logoth_> Wait for Kiwami 5
[2:38:04] <gustavozxd> this is a Wii u game though
[2:38:05] <frozenottsel> Linus Sebastian runs an 8k and 16k setup
[2:38:06] <majindusto> YAKUZA 5 RUNS GREAT YOU CRAZY FUCK
[2:38:07] <%El_Desperad0> Didn't you have issues streaming Bloodlines every time?
[2:38:11] <%gambit_gamble> 1600k is where is at now days
[2:38:17] <%logoth_> Wait for Kiwami 5 in like 12 years
[2:38:17] <+misterfistor> rip, ill stick with 1080 then. thank ya for saving me $800 pat
[2:38:17] <Mr_Strut> Unless you're Pat
[2:38:19] <%CaptainPileDriver> when's kiwami 2 pat?
[2:38:20] <%zanzibar_junker> go
[2:38:24] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I can still play fucking snes games
[2:38:25] <T_Sasquatch> I can understand the logic because it would feel outdated aftr going through the improvements
[2:38:27] <%Ascethetic> 980ti here
[2:38:30] <%TeraMercier> Pat, I really appreciate how clear you've made it that the 2080 was an absurd luxury purchase, not a natural upgrade
[2:38:34] <$RubberFistFight> @frozenottsel yeah but Linus has Linus Money. That shit's a superpower.
[2:38:36] <ameraaaaaa> imagine is majima was a cute anime girl
[2:38:38] <Admiral_PopnFresh> time for the gun
[2:38:39] <natebud> You did this chat
[2:38:39] <%CaptainTubaki> @misterfistor i also have a 1080 i promise you dont even bother with that upgrade its a waste of money
[2:38:42] <gustavozxd> I DONT WANT RHIS THE
[2:38:42] <+DingusMcFadden> Yeah, I wish the aim for consoles was to hit 60Fps, not high-fidelity graphics, @AngriestPat
[2:38:43] <Mr_Strut> 540m here. It fucking sucks.
[2:38:44] <%Keyd00d> that was before I played it
[2:38:45] <%CaptainPileDriver> i do, i always want more yakuza
[2:38:47] <%BestTeaMaker> I wanted DOS2
[2:38:47] <%Afterman_> i voted for vampire
[2:38:47] <NickHatesSnow> I wasnt
[2:38:48] <gustavozxd> I don't want this though
[2:38:50] <Dao_Puppy> Set up multi-twitch and play both at the SAME TIME.
[2:38:51] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Because....its fun?
[2:38:53] <frozenottsel> Pat has a Red Bull sponsorship
[2:38:53] <ミュウレ4242> bloodlines has an amazing story. yakuza games besides 0 and 5 do not.
[2:38:54] <Mnightshyamallama> and now we want you to play 5 so you can play 6
[2:38:55] <ameraaaaaa> KonCha like this
[2:38:56] <%radda343> number go up
[2:38:57] <majindusto> And We want you to Play Yakuza 5

[2:39:00] <DraxTD> @AngriestPat have you even touched Song of Life?
[2:39:00] <natebud> That boat seems.... familiar
[2:39:01] <FackinCrazy> Im waiting for the graphics card that runs off of blood to come out so I can get that sick demonic level graphics
[2:39:01] <%El_Desperad0> SPEED GO UP
[2:39:02] <%TeraMercier> That was legit appreciation, to be clear
[2:39:04] <NickHatesSnow> I wanted Bloodlines
[2:39:06] <%CaptainTubaki> dear god pat NotLikeThis
[2:39:07] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It makes the FPS number go up
[2:39:08] <%spiritofmojave> Oh yes, this scene is coming up.
[2:39:09] <+WhereIsWill> got an amd rx480 and i love it
[2:39:11] <%BestTeaMaker> I'm waiting for Pat to get to DOS2 and get through the Red Prince's quests
[2:39:13] <Conky89> 2080 ti will be the standard in at least maybe 15 years
[2:39:15] <PerrinIsDead> Dont play what ya dont likee
[2:39:17] <+Blankets_and_Tea> just play 6 4Head
[2:39:18] <%Niney_Who> 3
[2:39:19] <%Mekhet09> Man, I can use a 1060 to still play games at 60 FPS.
[2:39:19] <%zanzibar_junker> why bring haruka
[2:39:20] <+HellCopter> Skip 5, it doesn't matter!
[2:39:20] <mayorrev> 3
[2:39:20] <InugamiTheHound> isn't this the same boat from yakuza 0
[2:39:21] <Caidezes> LUL
[2:39:22] <+cvp5127> LUL
[2:39:22] <Bouldus> yes you can
[2:39:22] <Them00n> When the twitch money stops coming in you are so fucked. @AngriestPat
[2:39:23] <RadSuit> Then play 5 already.

[2:39:23] <takiyami> were stupid
[2:39:26] <%ALTRNico> yes you can
[2:39:26] <%Keyd00d> IT'S TRUE
[2:39:26] <%gambit_gamble> FINISH IT
[2:39:27] <KeiPrime> yeah you can
[2:39:27] <%CaptainPileDriver> because you will never finish 5
[2:39:27] <%SvenHolgersson> WHY U NO PLAY GAME
[2:39:28] <%BigNerdSam> Play J
[2:39:28] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> I hear ya
[2:39:28] <+Comrade_Vladof> So finish 5 then
[2:39:29] <%Niney_Who> What if the PREQUEL is the SEQUEL?
[2:39:29] <official_nakmatic> Except birth by sleep
[2:39:29] <%radda343> I never played 5 and loved 6
[2:39:30] <alexandrecau> but play 6 though
[2:39:30] <%SvenHolgersson> WHY PAT
[2:39:30] <Smaenus> You really can honestly
[2:39:32] <majindusto> PLAY 5, PLAY 5, PLAY 5
[2:39:32] <+Ryutaryi> Bull shit you can't
[2:39:32] <+Maids4lyfe> yes you can
[2:39:32] <Dao_Puppy> Look, some of us are jerking off here....
[2:39:32] <%MrBorisMakarov> PLAY 5 THO

[2:39:33] <%Reizie_Etherealm> YOU CAN
[2:39:33] <redial_nick> beat it today
[2:39:34] <+Blankets_and_Tea> i agree pat
[2:39:34] <+HellCopter> Song of Life tells you the ending of 5 and it's way better
[2:39:34] <%Spydurman> watch the cut scenes with us?
[2:39:35] <natebud> Then why didn't you play Silent Hill 4!? @AngriestPat
[2:39:35] <%Afterman_> so by that logic play kiwami 2 next
[2:39:36] <%BigNerdSam> Play 5 tho
[2:39:36] <%PlainSimpleTailor> G O B L I N S
[2:39:37] <%Hiro01231> I mean you can I agree you shouldn't thoigh
[2:39:37] <KeiPrime> i didnt even touch 3 4 or 5
[2:39:37] <%Afterman_> beofre 5
[2:39:37] <Caidezes> Just play them all at the same time, Pat.
[2:39:37] <ooblag> You totally can though, if you don't want to play the prequel
[2:39:37] <FackinCrazy> FUCK YOU TERADA
[2:39:38] <DraxTD> so take your shot and finish the damn prequil.. it'll be decades before a re rlice
[2:39:38] <%Sovspot> are you having a mental break down pat
[2:39:39] <SailingSaturn> @AngriestPat DMC2 tho cirSmug
[2:39:39] <InugamiTheHound> just beat yakuza 5 off stream
[2:39:39] <$RubberFistFight> @AngriestPat I do feel it necessary to light-heartedly rib you by pointing out that you happily played I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, so complaining about a Ps3 game being janky is a bit funny Kappa
[2:39:40] <Mr_Strut> Just like Zone of the Enders, right?
[2:39:41] <gustavozxd> yes you can Pat, but I understand, but you can, but you're right, but you're wrong
[2:39:41] <Ner234> I get you Pat. I understand.
[2:39:42] <%SvenHolgersson> PAT U FUK HOW DARE U
[2:39:42] <Saltmeisterr> NO JUST PLAY IT
[2:39:43] <%Mekhet09> Finish five by yourself so we can see you play 6.
[2:39:43] <%Sovspot> you are very irritable
[2:39:43] <+DingusMcFadden> Pat played FF5 before 6 and 7
[2:39:43] <dekkitout> Tell that to everyone who played God of War 2018
[2:39:44] <%gus_hornblende> @AngriestPat like, this is the most understandable of gobolins
[2:39:44] <%Edgy_Macaroon> I agree pat
[2:39:46] <%spiritofmojave> Six is the perfect summertime game, SKIP 5
[2:39:46] <+Maids4lyfe> I played dark souls 3 and never any of the first games
[2:39:48] <%iwishthiswasicq> He's right guys, you can't play Persona 3 before you play Personas 1 and 2.
[2:39:48] <+RowenCleric> wait you havent played Song of Life yet!?
[2:39:48] <Mr_Strut> And DMC2
[2:39:51] <DarkOmen98> i missed 3, 4, and 5 and went from k2 to 6 and it was FINE :P
[2:39:51] <+Blankets_and_Tea> hello korean mafia man
[2:39:54] <+drakthebest> Pat is super right what the fuck is wrong with you people
[2:39:55] <majindusto> You didn't
[2:39:55] <yourliteraldog> Use child as wepon
[2:39:56] <fruit_pie_the_magician> 6 has been out for a fucking year dude
[2:39:56] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Dammit Pat, why don't you just start at Kingdom Hearts 3 like a "normal" person!
[2:39:57] <SonicTheHedgeog> @angriestpat are you gonna stream kiwami 2 at some point?
[2:39:59] <%QueequegTheater> "Is this the place with the porn for this child"
[2:40:00] <%MightyMaxT> @AngriestPat But Yakuza 6 has Virtua Fighter in it
[2:40:02] <Luesagna00> just completely ignore the story pat its that simple
[2:40:04] <%Merkensteiner> Skip Part 1 and 2 of Jojo and read Part 7
[2:40:04] <%SvenHolgersson> Play the games we want you to not in chronological order
[2:40:04] <Bouldus> what about mass effect, most people say that starts and ends at 2
[2:40:05] <T_Sasquatch> @Blankets_and_Tea spoilersss
[2:40:06] <+BaekTheHeck> its him... the fucker
[2:40:06] <%Nope80808> He aint playin 5 til it gets ported on PC in 5 years
[2:40:08] <%tizz86> I'll stick with my 960m because I'm a cheap ass
[2:40:09] <takiyami> owned
[2:40:10] <ameraaaaaa> pat you are a weirdo of absurd proportions
[2:40:11] <mayorrev> why streamer man not play game like i want to play????
[2:40:12] <%Keyd00d> those aren't sequels
[2:40:13] <KeiPrime> pat played ff2 adn 3 before 4
[2:40:14] <%Reizie_Etherealm> NO FORClNG, NO PEER PRESSURE
[2:40:15] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> @iwishthiswasicq This but unironically B)
[2:40:17] <%afronooch> doesn't matter with ff tho
[2:40:17] <RadSuit> He's super fucked @Them00n there's no way he can live like a normal person after this.
[2:40:17] <Mr_Strut> I did. FF5 is great.
[2:40:20] <+DingusMcFadden> OOOOOOOH! FUCK!
[2:40:21] <%PlainSimpleTailor> So you should only play DMC V after REPLAYING DMC 2 again
[2:40:22] <%BigNerdSam> Pat, I know for a fact you played FF7 first.
[2:40:26] <natebud> I was hiding out on the hideout boat
[2:40:27] <xvalltana> didnt you play RE2 before 1? @AngriestPat
[2:40:30] <alexandrecau> man kazama is gonna reveal he is a dick
[2:40:30] <arcaderabbit48> @AngriestPat Dammit Pat, why don't you just start at Kingdom Hearts 3 like a "normal" person!
[2:40:31] <gustavozxd> oh you played FF1 and 2? oof LUL
[2:40:32] <+RowenCleric> FUCK silent hill 4 reminds me there will be no shit storm, its setting in now
[2:40:33] <Dr_Mooose> Papa
[2:40:33] <ooblag> Why did you skip DMC2 then?
[2:40:35] <%TeraMercier> The Mass Effect games are intended as a story continuity, so only doing 2 loses a lot of intended content
[2:40:36] <%brickwall35> Pat how much money does Kirby Sauce need to donate to get you to Pocket Race?
[2:40:39] <SilverInferno3> I still can't decide if Kazama is the worst father ever or not
[2:40:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @RowenCleric RIP
[2:40:50] <Dest_121> then why didn't you play Dmc 2 then @AngriestPat
[2:40:51] <%TeraMercier> Don't the Final Fantasy games have almost no continuity?
[2:40:53] <DracaenaLeaf> the big story
[2:40:54] <%Yokuho> 1? you mean 4?
[2:40:58] <%Spydurman> You didn't play Risk of Rain 1 Jebaited
[2:40:58] <KeiPrime> 0 continuity
[2:40:59] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, when are we gonna get yakuza 5 then, i know it's on the ps3 but come on pat
[2:41:00] <majindusto> GOALPOST MOVING
[2:41:04] <Mr_Strut> Pat is now obligated to play dmc2 before he can play dmc5 ever again.
[2:41:05] <+DingusMcFadden> Pat with the save by technicality
[2:41:05] <SilverInferno3> Naniiiiiii
[2:41:08] <dekkitout> NANI?!?
[2:41:09] <%QueequegTheater> EINHORN IS FINKEL
[2:41:09] <%BigNerdSam> HOW THE FUCK DID FUCCBOlVIN PLAY 1 WITHOUT A CHILDHOOD?
[2:41:09] <derekwst3> you didn't know they weren't connected until you played 7
[2:41:10] <%genowyn> My first yakuza was 5
[2:41:11] <KeiPrime> its not crazy cause the digest videos
[2:41:11] <natebud> I have played DMC2 EXTENSIVELY and I understand completely Pat.
[2:41:12] <+Quigsies> EHHHHHH
[2:41:13] <+drakthebest> And you are super right
[2:41:15] <%gus_hornblende> It's hard enough keeping up with a Yakuza game's plot, don't make it harder by skipping a game
[2:41:15] <%ALTRNico> eeehh
[2:41:16] <%PlainSimpleTailor> We need more people to submit more crazy sub messages to compete with Kirby
[2:41:17] <+Maids4lyfe> Kazuma is a better father than Vergil
[2:41:25] <+Chronobot> D:
[2:41:25] <%CaptainPileDriver> we want to relive santa running away from children
[2:41:26] <%spiritofmojave> And Kazuma lets them know exactly NONE OF THIS SHIT
[2:41:27] <KeiPrime> who would watch a lets play of yakuza 4 before playing or watching 1 2 and 3
[2:41:28] <%castcode> oh ok
[2:41:28] <gustavozxd> people should play megami tensei 1 before persona 5
[2:41:29] <%ALTRNico> NANI?
[2:41:30] <%QueequegTheater> Majima is the mother
[2:41:33] <T_Sasquatch> thats why you watch a youtube cutscene movie
[2:41:34] <SilverInferno3> @Maids4lyfe Okay fair
[2:41:36] <reonome> DUNDUNDUNNNN
[2:41:36] <%gus_hornblende> Plus, Yakuza 5's ending I thought was really, really great
[2:41:36] <NickHatesSnow> You streaming anything else tonight or just this
[2:41:36] <%iwishthiswasicq> Because it's a hard plot to keep up with makes me not give a fuck.
[2:41:37] <%kewlmyc> SHOCKER
[2:41:38] <FackinCrazy> 3 is the only one i skipped and thats because FUCK paying $80 for a copy
[2:41:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TeraMercier okay so it's weird, some do, some don't, FFX has some weird continuity with 7, and there's the sequels to some games like X-2, XIII-2, etc
[2:41:39] <+Blankets_and_Tea> i played yakuza 6 after playing every other game before it, and the emotional payoff was unparalleled
[2:41:39] <+DingusMcFadden> Kazuma is a grandpa, chat
[2:41:39] <Mnightshyamallama> @Dest_121 just because he didn't stream it doesn't mean he never played dmc2
[2:41:40] <+Maids4lyfe> LUL
[2:41:40] <%Reizie_Etherealm> You can get former knowledge without playing it if you don't wanna play
[2:41:42] <%TeraMercier> Kazuma was only vaguely an absentee dad, Virg is a deadbeat
[2:41:44] <%ALTRNico> WHO?
[2:41:47] <dekkitout> Yeah, totally....I uh, knew it the whole time-
[2:41:49] <ooblag> I'll fill you in on the story. Some yakuza BETRAYED Kiryu. Then THEY REDEEMED THEMSELVES. Now Kiryu is NO LONGER A YAKUZA. There, you're up to date.
[2:41:50] <natebud> Jingu the Drunkard?
[2:41:50] <%SvenHolgersson> YOU KIRYU
[2:41:55] <%gambit_gamble> pimp walk
[2:41:59] <Luesagna00> @angriestpat pat it be like skipping and read the LAST page of a book to see if its good before starting to read it.
[2:41:59] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CaptainPileDriver) (warning)
[2:42:00] <+mik255> the bigger plot twist is jingu
[2:42:01] <+Blankets_and_Tea> jingu more like pingu
[2:42:03] <%Niney_Who> Her dad is the OLD COWARD MAN
[2:42:05] <+DingusMcFadden> ...back when I was married, and cool
[2:42:06] <T_Sasquatch> fucking jingu
[2:42:07] <Dao_Puppy> Jpeg haruka?
[2:42:12] <alexandrecau> That Jingu dude kind of feel he dropped out of nowhere
[2:42:13] <%Tucker0603> he has a dumb dot on his head
[2:42:14] <$RubberFistFight> just fuckin pushing that photo into the kid's face
[2:42:16] <%zanzibar_junker> gov'ment
[2:42:18] <%CaptainPileDriver> fuck the corrupt politicans.
[2:42:18] <%radda343> but pat if you don't play 6 you'll never get to fistfight beat takeshi
[2:42:18] <xvalltana> @ALTRNico Jingu bro
[2:42:18] <+mik255> why is that dot always villainous?
[2:42:18] <CastellanVon> They don't really explain how Yumi fell in love with Jingu.
[2:42:23] <%TeraMercier> It always felt to me like the Final Fantasy's took place in different universes, practically. But I really never played much of them
[2:42:24] <FackinCrazy> Jingu is the secret boss
[2:42:34] <SilverInferno3> @alexandrecau He absolutely did, this game dropped the ball in villain department
[2:42:34] <DasFreekman> Jingu All The Way
[2:42:37] <%Radregice_> he has nice feet
[2:42:37] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Jingu bell, Jingu bell, Jingu all the way
[2:42:37] <%Niney_Who> Pat loves feet
[2:42:40] <%CaptainPileDriver> the last 2 boss fights in this game suck
[2:42:40] <alexandrecau> also since jinguis not a yakuza he is irredeemable sociopath
[2:42:45] <@PeachSaliva> Boo Pat is bad at being a Japanese crime boss man boooooo
[2:42:46] <fabo_joyful> peets

[2:48:30] <%TeraMercier> Haruka does what a good Japanese child should: stand there without complaining
[2:48:41] <+DingusMcFadden> Why didn't he just take the baby and throw it out a window?

[2:49:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @QueequegTheater I wanna say the scenario writer showed this to a crime novelist and the guy was like "What the hell is this? This is so stupid"

[2:57:43] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Lol, I thought the health said "Fucking Shimano" for a sec
[2:57:44] <Darkfire346> Macho Man, ohhh yeaaaaaah, dig it!
[2:57:45] <+mik255> this does feel like dynasty warriors
[2:57:46] <SomersaultJustice> do big cheats
[2:57:50] <%Afterman_> "meet me behind the school 330pm or be square"
[2:57:51] <beetbo2> Gang fights have never looked so stylish yet clunky
[2:57:52] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[2:57:53] <flame_of_udun_> Yakuza Musou
[2:57:55] <%CaptainPileDriver> and there's 2 even shittier fights after this
[2:57:55] <mayorrev> 20+ dudes beating the sht out of each other
[2:57:57] <+thesw1tch> @fackincrazy LUL
[2:57:58] <InugamiTheHound> this how they do gang fights in TOKYO!! DRFT!!
[2:58:03] <%Reizie_Etherealm> Yakuza Warriors
[2:58:05] <InugamiTheHound> DRIFT
[2:58:10] <%QueequegTheater> Only two dudes are even throwing any punches
[2:58:11] <%logoth_> That's a lot of DORAAA
[2:58:16] <SomersaultJustice> I'd play Yakuza Musou
[2:58:19] <%Tucker0603> USE GODSPEED WITH BEAST
[2:58:21] <+mik255> is nishki good at least?
[2:58:22] <%Afterman_> 20 dudes beating each others face, one of them is shirtless, fat, and has his daddys katana
[2:58:22] <NotHereToStream> padding sucks
[2:58:22] <Smaenus> Yeah it really does lol
[2:58:26] <+funnyfunnykid> Doesnt Beast have a move where you can knock out 4 people at once?
[2:58:28] <%nano_vg> nooo what
[2:58:28] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> That dude's infusing his blade with ki energy moon2D
[2:58:35] <natebud> getting older all the time
[2:58:36] <InugamiTheHound> maybe they make a Dynasty warriors: Gundam
[2:58:36] <beetbo2> Ditto
[2:58:37] <gustavozxd> I felt like this game fell apart right from the first 30 minutes but eh
[2:58:39] <takiyami> I would play a Yakuza mosou game
[2:58:41] <%Afterman_> no one
[2:58:41] <%ALTRNico> just keep hitting
[2:58:44] <beetbo2> Big Free for all
[2:58:45] <flame_of_udun_> You can tell this is a remake of the FIRST game
[2:58:46] <Dr_Mooose> no one's your friend
[2:58:46] <natebud> feeling older all the time
[2:58:46] <%Edgy_Macaroon> kill them all
[2:58:49] <starotter70> Trust no one
[2:58:49] <+DingusMcFadden> Whoa, Pat just got real with us, chat
[2:58:52] <InugamiTheHound> dynasty warriors:Yakuza
[2:58:54] <MasterDecoder> Grey is friend, purple is not
[2:58:57] <+BaekTheHeck> yeah yakuza 1 never had the best of plots
[2:58:58] <Superscooter> i hated this fight
[2:58:58] <InugamiTheHound> sorry
[2:59:00] <%korth367> because you can hit them
[2:59:03] <+Blankets_and_Tea> amazing
[2:59:04] <SomersaultJustice> that's why kiryu always has to save the tojo
[2:59:04] <mayorrev> YARE YARE
[2:59:04] <%korth367> it's fucking stupid
[2:59:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Probably cuz they killed people
[2:59:07] <CastellanVon> You started with like 5 guys and Shimano had like 20
[2:59:09] <%SvenHolgersson> Unlike Kiryu
[2:59:10] <%spiritofmojave> truck men are a bunch of jobbers
[2:59:12] <MasterDecoder> Nevermind, I'm wrong
[2:59:15] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> They're all Rare characters while Kiryu is the only SSR on the team
[2:59:16] <%Ilpala> FLYING HEADBUTT?!
[2:59:46] <+DingusMcFadden> Did he poop?
[2:59:49] <SomersaultJustice> quick, now kill fujoshi shimano
[2:59:51] <%Divryne> It's fine just kill everyone.
[2:59:53] <Darkfire346> Kiryu has found their weakness! Being punched really really hard in the face!
[3:00:03] <+thesw1tch> @masterdecoder you cant be wrong if you believe you are right. George costanza said something like that
[3:00:03] <%Afterman_> more like FAToshi shimano
[3:00:04] <%spiritofmojave> LUL
[3:00:05] <SilverInferno3> LUL
[3:00:07] <%ALTRNico> LUL
[3:00:07] <Dr_Mooose> ok LUL
[3:00:09] <dekkitout> He is a dense boi
[3:00:09] <beetbo2> his sword BROKE??
[3:00:09] <AnacondaVirtue> Glorious Nippon Steel
[3:00:10] <%MoraMiarty> gripped the sword too hard
[3:00:10] <beetbo2> lol
[3:00:11] <GMN1> U WOT
[3:00:13] <+mr_whet_faartz> that was goofy af
[3:00:14] <%radda343> punch him until his sword explodes
[3:00:16] <InugamiTheHound> his sword broke just cause??
[3:00:17] <Smaenus> It's Yakuza magic don't worry about it
[3:00:19] <SomersaultJustice> it was only folded 999 times
[3:00:25] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Redpointshine)
[3:00:27] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> the baby flail
[3:00:30] <%nano_vg> that amount of headbutts and no "permanent" brain bmg
[3:00:30] <+theAncopro> Shimano would have absolutely been a shakedown
[3:00:31] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> No stun koilS moon2VERYSCARED
[3:00:31] <%Radregice_> reusing movesets is like 50% of this series
[3:00:32] <Admiral_PopnFresh> Oh my god it is Mr. Shakedown
[3:00:33] <+DingusMcFadden> Mr Futoshi, the ORIGINAL Mr. Shakedown
[3:00:33] <+mik255> they didnt even give him a unique moveset
[3:00:35] <majindusto> BIG PAPA SHAKEDOWN
[3:00:35] <mrosito1r> Did pat take out his allies?
[3:00:35] <%BigNerdSam> SHAKE HlM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER
[3:00:36] <%MoraMiarty> Futoshi "Shakedown" Shimano
[3:00:36] <%spiritofmojave> Exact same animations
[3:00:39] <%MightyMaxT> <MISTER SHAKEDOWN>
[3:00:39] <SilverInferno3> God I hate superarmor
[3:00:40] <ミュウレ4242> unlike mr shakedown tho, he's vulnerable to tiger drop.
[3:00:40] <Desertfishing> fucking take it shimano
[3:00:42] <beetbo2> @SomersaultJustice the sword lacked MOTIVATION
[3:00:44] <Basch71> more like mr shakedown is a shimano clone
[3:00:45] <+BaekTheHeck> rip mister shakedown
[3:00:46] <Gameslayer2> This is gonna take a while
[3:00:47] <takiyami> He's just Mr. Shakedown, but somehow even less fun
[3:00:50] <+funnyfunnykid> Then it's time to take out the ol' tazer shotgun and baseball bat technique
[3:00:53] <@Fuggins4U> Master Shakedown
[3:01:04] <Darkfire346> oh fuck that noise!
[3:01:09] <alexandrecau> rush helps a lot
[3:01:13] <majindusto> If Only you had Tiger Drop
[3:01:13] <InugamiTheHound> Kiryu breaking a lot fingers with his elbow
[3:01:18] <takiyami> He has a cool theme song though
[3:01:18] <Darkfire346> ATATATATATA
[3:01:19] <alexandrecau> like compared to past games
[3:01:20] <Smaenus> Like 3 of those were direct dick punches
[3:01:21] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> ORA ORA ORA moon2POGGYWOGGY
[3:01:22] <natebud> Mr. Shakedown without the huge damage, so no fun.
[3:01:22] <SomersaultJustice> did pat level up that style that lets him powerbomb people?
[3:01:24] <Dr_Mooose> that dude's weighs like 300+
[3:01:26] <flame_of_udun_> O R A
[3:01:26] <+mik255> i like that kiryu gets in a quick dick punch with that move
[3:01:27] <Darkfire346> MUDA MUDA MUDA
[3:01:27] <fruit_pie_the_magician> He was Mr Shakedown the first time, too
[3:01:29] <%El_Desperad0> Kiwami means beat up bald people
[3:01:29] <plzza_kun> SourPls
[3:01:31] <godzookylives> Kiryu has adamantium elbows
[3:01:37] <$RubberFistFight> oh shit he's building up his POW meter
[3:01:39] <+DingusMcFadden> Kaz is all "That's MY PURSE!"\
[3:01:50] <%Nope80808> WANNABE WANNABE WANNaBE
[3:01:50] <%CaptainPileDriver> @AngriestPat do you have the tiger punch counter yet? if not it makes this fight trivial
[3:02:00] <$RubberFistFight> and apparently Kiryu has the Satsui no hadou
[3:02:02] <%ALTRNico> drink more staminans for heat
[3:02:08] <Dr_Mooose> and is just juggled
[3:02:16] <Smaenus> @CaptainPileDriver It makes the whole game trivial LUL
[3:02:16] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> aww
[3:02:26] <ooblag> @CaptainPileDriver He doesn't, and Pat got a little upset when people told him to get it
[3:02:27] <natebud> Trucks!? Why aren't you helping!?
[3:02:29] <%TeraMercier> I really hated doing the same heat move to the same boss over and over
[3:02:37] <+HeadsHeldHigh> JABBU JABBU
[3:02:37] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> woof
[3:02:39] <%Niney_Who> He doesn't even have the FULL shakedown movelist
[3:02:39] <flame_of_udun_> How much punishment can one bald guy take
[3:02:41] <%Niney_Who> Just the basic one
[3:02:42] <+mik255> he seemed too easy
[3:02:42] <alexandrecau> pat doesn't want tiger drop he wants to support cocaine instead
[3:02:44] <ShreddingPixels> big level ups
[3:02:44] <CastellanVon> dies to the tap fist.
[3:02:45] <+river_city98> dick punch finisher
[3:02:45] <%SvenHolgersson> KIDNEY PAUNCH
[3:02:47] <%Naho_Saenoki> @CaptainPileDriver The more people tell him to get Tiger Drop, the more he refuses to.
[3:02:49] <+DingusMcFadden> You punched him in his dick, PAt. Don't be proud
[3:02:52] <$RubberFistFight> @natebud pat should have gone and picked up a truck and hit him with it. Would done like... 24% of his healthbar in one hit Kappa
[3:02:54] <natebud> grenade...
[3:02:58] <%spiritofmojave> here comes some silly bullshit
[3:03:00] <benjiFG> good job son
[3:03:04] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@CastellanVon) (warning)

[3:03:23] <%SvenHolgersson> JESUS
[3:03:23] <starotter70> Yeeeeee
[3:03:24] <%JenovasPuppet> Should have used the cane like a baseball bat
[3:03:24] <%Niney_Who> DAD NO
[3:03:25] <NotHereToStream> it helped his yakuza throw
[3:03:25] <Dest_121> a grenade would have killed them both
[3:03:26] <%castcode> I think he's dead
[3:03:26] <alexandrecau> wow that was the strong grenade
[3:03:27] <%BigNerdSam> He was hy
[3:03:27] <%Radregice_> i'm so glad he's dead though
[3:03:28] <%MisterTylerrr> Doesn't that guy survive?
[3:03:28] <%brickwall35> why didn't he hit the grenade with his cane
[3:03:29] <%MoraMiarty> shooting him six times was a great way to stop that grenade
[3:03:30] <%spiritofmojave> BOTH OF THEM SHOULD
[3:03:31] <+mik255> kazama tanked a grenade
[3:03:33] <starotter70> Taking it like a pro
[3:03:34] <gustavozxd> dude has power armor
[3:03:34] <joneworldbeater> She's fine
[3:03:34] <beetbo2> he looks great considering the grenade go boom
[3:03:35] <missingangle> How is he not in pieces?
[3:03:37] <%El_Desperad0> Those weren't Murican grenades
[3:03:38] <+zaworldo> HE'S FINE
[3:03:38] <%logoth_> not a single burn
[3:03:40] <+DingusMcFadden> I was hoping he was gonna hit the granade with is cane witha Baseball windup
[3:03:40] <Dr_Mooose> he's tough
[3:03:41] <flame_of_udun_> Kazama > grenades confirmed
[3:03:42] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> he's fine~
[3:03:42] <+funnyfunnykid> wait he's not a pile of meat?
[3:03:43] <+zaworldo> HE'S LITERALLY FINE
[3:03:43] <%ALTRNico> how are they fine
[3:03:44] <natebud> All he needs is a dry cleaner
[3:03:44] <ooblag> Here's a better question, WHY IS HIRAKA NOT FUCKING HAMBERGUR
[3:03:44] <reonome> BibleThump
[3:03:44] <%Radregice_> no pat we need an emotional death monologue
[3:03:44] <%Sasquatch_John> he had a god damn grenade explode ON HIM
[3:03:45] <%MightyMaxT> He was shot in the head, but the blood was coming from his back...
[3:03:46] <+thecho1> its a cutscene grenade tho
[3:03:46] <%SvenHolgersson> Grenade proof suit
[3:03:47] <dekkitout> He suddenly caught anime mom disease
[3:03:47] <Dest_121> his suit is still perfect excluding the blood
[3:03:47] <CrowbarFacelift> It was just some shrapnel he's a strong old goat
[3:03:47] <Smaenus> I hope I die in such PRISTINE condition
[3:03:48] <%Edgy_Macaroon> yakuza are tough pat
[3:03:48] <alrobot2014> he doesn't look like he's dying
[3:03:48] <alexandrecau> kazama is a tough bastard
[3:03:49] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Th blast wave does shit too
[3:03:49] <+KSabot> it's a fragmentation grenade
[3:03:49] <TheBlankAce> Japanese grenades are not the best
[3:03:53] <%spiritofmojave> He got his head cut lightly BibleThump
[3:03:53] <Gameslayer2> He is BARELY hurt
[3:03:54] <%castcode> Hiraka
[3:03:57] <%JenovasPuppet> Oh my GOOOOOOOOOD
[3:03:57] <CastellanVon> Tough Yakuza Gangstar Grandpa > Grenade
[3:03:57] <Admiral_PopnFresh> hamburger..........Bernie BibleThump
[3:03:58] <%radda343> "Call an ambulance right after you shot that guy with an illegal gun"
[3:03:58] <$RubberFistFight> dude he should be a smoking limbless charheap
[3:03:59] <DarkOmen98> cohhNani
[3:03:59] <%Laecerelius> His strong Yakuza body cannot be penetrated by grenade shrapnel!
[3:04:01] <%Shadowthedigger> I mean it blew up like 5 feet in the air.
[3:04:02] <+HeadsHeldHigh> Suit is PERFECT considering...
[3:04:03] <beetbo2> maybe most of the damage was shockwave stuff and not shrapnel for some reason
[3:04:04] <CastellanVon> It was a rubber grenade!
[3:04:04] <+mik255> he was way tougher than we thought
[3:04:05] <%Reaped_Psyche> It hit him in thew back and grenades are usually shrapnel injuries.
[3:04:06] <reonome> dun dun dunnnnn
[3:04:06] <$RubberFistFight> what is this barely-splashed-with-blood bullshit
[3:04:08] <dekkitout> So is Kiryu gonna go Super Saiyan now?
[3:04:11] <SomersaultJustice> launderingu
[3:04:11] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> Shimano had a tiger but so does Saejima, who is physically stronger? moon2T
[3:04:11] <%logoth_> Muney Launderingka
[3:04:12] <RealPT1> just a flashbang
[3:04:13] <%shiplord13> Sleep it off you wimp
[3:04:14] <%Valentinius_Anodyne> It's Kiryu's stand; it prevents people from sustaning serious injury when they're near him
[3:04:17] <CrypticMochi> Japanese frags have no shockwave
[3:04:21] <%Shadowthedigger> He got hit by shrapnel and the boom; he's probably fucked inside at least.
[3:04:21] <+DingusMcFadden> ELMOS. NEEDS. WARMTH.
[3:04:22] <alexandrecau> @AngriestPat you took like 10 grenades to the face as Kiryu kazam can tank one
[3:04:23] <%gunnar253> apatElmo
[3:04:28] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> AREEEEES
[3:04:32] <%Sir_Gawain_Lotsson> ZEUUUUUS
[3:04:32] <alexandrecau> final chapter
[3:04:41] <natebud> How are japanese grenades compared to pinapples or potato mashers?
[3:04:42] <SomersaultJustice> I'm sure this japanese drama will have a happy ending for everyone
[3:04:43] <Darkfire346> its dank weed!
[3:04:45] <st4rrytea> !uptime

[3:05:56] <beetbo2> wait theres a live action movie?
[3:05:58] <%MoraMiarty> I feel like they were almost too faithful in recreating some of Yakuzas less thriling parts
[3:05:59] <%Gespens> The Live Action movie is bad, but the Majima scenes are gold
[3:06:02] <%spiritofmojave> He is TERRIBLE
[3:06:04] <starotter70> What about the Fist of the North Star Movie
[3:06:07] <flame_of_udun_> He killed enough parents to fill an ENTIRE orphanage...just think about that
[3:06:08] <dekkitout> WAT?!

[3:06:49] <indig0bird> Oh, fuck that
[3:06:51] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> moon2PH moon2PH moon2PH moon2PH
[3:06:51] <Caidezes> wtf
[3:06:51] <+Quigsies> GANG-STAR
[3:06:52] <SomersaultJustice> kiryu actually died and the rest of yakuza is a coma dream
[3:06:53] <+mik255> the movie does a better job with majima than kiwami
[3:06:53] <%Divryne> Shut up it's very Japanese.
[3:06:54] <%mercado94> LOYALTY
[3:06:54] <Darkfire346> SHOOT HIS CORPSE
[3:06:54] <reonome> BibleThump
[3:06:54] <Dest_121> the only reason he is your only father is becuase he killed them kiryu
[3:06:55] <GundamF91> @SilverInferno3 She really is, and how much she's brought up in 1 you'd think she would be an actual character
[3:06:57] <T_Sasquatch> this reveal is fucked
[3:06:57] <dekkitout> He may have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy
[3:06:59] <+theAncopro> I like my new dad anyway
[3:06:59] <%CollinsOfBodom> F
[3:07:00] <%spiritofmojave> I love you dad, not like the parents you killed :)
[3:07:00] <Bouldus> but Japan though
[3:07:00] <+KSabot> he didn't know his real parents so who cares : \
[3:07:01] <godzookylives> He is Solidus
[3:07:04] <%logoth_> Oops~ All Patricide!
[3:07:04] <+DingusMcFadden> Se how japanese japan is?
[3:07:05] <+xBitWolf> nah man, he was the family he wanted all along
[3:07:06] <%Nope80808> Thats Japan
[3:07:06] <$RubberFistFight> that's dumb as bricks LUL
[3:07:06] <%MoraMiarty> Man, Kazama is the actual worst, huh
[3:07:07] <+Someitalian123> Yes but kiriyu is japanese, lol
[3:07:08] <%ALTRNico> HE'S A GANGSTAR PAT
[3:07:09] <alexandrecau> kiryu didn't like his parents anyway
[3:07:10] <Dr_Mooose> your my real father, man that killed my father
[3:07:10] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> ?
[3:07:10] <reonome> now all of his dads are dead
[3:07:11] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Tucker0603)
[3:07:12] <+JackMillerTime> but he raised him
[3:07:12] <Caidezes> Revive him and kill him again.
[3:07:13] <Ner234> Did Kiryu know his real parents?
[3:07:14] <Bouldus> thats how Japan work Kappa
[3:07:15] <InugamiTheHound> @godzookylives I said the same thing!!
[3:07:19] <%MoraMiarty> Why is kiryu friends with some of the worst criminals ever
[3:07:20] <Sorrow_the_Hikikomori> That's big heart moon2CUTE moon2PH
[3:07:21] <%Keyd00d> FINALE
[3:07:21] <SilverInferno3> @GundamF91 You could say the same for Nishiki back in the original
[3:07:24] <mayorrev> it's overrrrrrr
[3:07:24] <+Blankets_and_Tea> it really is
[3:07:25] <Dest_121> the fact he didn't react at all is the most insulting thing
[3:07:25] <%Hiro01231> He doesn't care about his biological parents just his logical fam
[3:07:25] <flame_of_udun_> Big dumb go up
[3:07:26] <beetbo2> Kiryuu helped us find the Gangstarr in us all tonight
[3:07:26] <alrobot2014> i killed your parents... NO WAY YOU'RE MY REAL DAD
[3:07:26] <%Toynota10> Can someone make a video of Pat being edited into the game shouting how stupid Kiryu is?
[3:07:27] <nivlac_555> whaaa
[3:07:27] <%spiritofmojave> that it is
[3:07:28] <starotter70> Yup
[3:07:28] <%JenovasPuppet> I mean maybe his real parents were evil

[3:07:39] <%CaptainPileDriver> kiryuu, this makes all your future exploits stupid
[3:07:42] <+DingusMcFadden> Ok, now fill the rest of the time by kissing Elmo
[3:07:42] <%GarbageNirvana> Hey Kiryu, how does it feel rescuing the man that killed your father?
