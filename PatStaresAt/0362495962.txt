[0:10:53] <%kabermano> Cheer1500 Hey pat! I was the guy asking for help in relation to my social anxiety back at the FF stream. I just came back from the Smash local and i figured i'd give an update. It was nice, real nice in fact. My Ridley got me to quarter finals before i got rocked by a Shulk main twice. Everyone was super hospitable and easy to talk to. And some guy convinced me that Master Chief has a pretty real chance of getting in as DLC. So i came out of that with a ton.
[0:10:58] <%megamonmon123> cheer100 hey grappy daddy, hope you and mustard mom are doing well. #Grabboivin
[0:10:59] <+Tygrathros0211> Pat connects to animals more than humans. Psycho boi

[0:17:39] <AMajorTom> If you could triple your subs by becoming a mouse and keyboard first person shooter man, would you do it?
[0:17:39] <+DespondentSloth> Institute is technically evil
[0:17:40] <%IMDRanged> Legion wears no pants
[0:17:40] <Mangahero18> No. FALSE. The Enclave is the best.
[0:17:42] <romanticzomedy> The Master was fantastic
[0:17:43] <notritehere> Does anyone know if pat still plays FFxiv ?
[0:17:43] <Calek> The Master is a big dumb dumb
[0:17:44] <+SpamKingRathalos> Enclave is the best
[0:17:45] <DarkKnightGrave> LUL
[0:17:46] <%TheSpiritof2277> FO2 Enclave has more an argument
[0:17:47] <%sparrrow_> but muh president
[0:17:47] <synthcutter> boomers are the least evil
[0:17:47] <%OwlLightningMage> The funniest thing is that Randy admitted that the porn is real. It's just up for debate if it was underage or not LUL
[0:17:47] <+SpamKingRathalos> hail America
[0:17:48] <321Continue> PatSaliva
[0:17:49] <dekkitout> institute: but androids tho
[0:17:50] <+Nomicro4u> Institute is sooooo dumb
[0:17:50] <%bread_assassin> Institute is probably better than the Legion.
[0:17:54] <+SpamKingRathalos> Nah
[0:17:54] <jijipose> The Institute has a well structured plan Kappa
[0:17:55] <+Ciphris> The Master was the only one you could actually argue with
[0:17:56] <TikanZK> you CANT talk to the institute LUL
[0:17:57] <Wyrmsblood> The Legion has an ethos
[0:17:58] <+SpamKingRathalos> Legion is better
[0:18:00] <%RascheTheRabbit> Got me a beer, time to listen to an hour of donations :D
[0:18:02] <MihajloMBlood> Legion have a doctrine
[0:18:04] <%megamonmon123> the boomers are hard neutral
[0:18:04] <+DespondentSloth> Legion holds actual territory
[0:18:07] <%genowyn> At least it's a fuckin' ethos, dude.
[0:18:09] <Pookiedaexzile> Theres only one good faction in Fallout. Me and gun
[0:18:12] <romanticzomedy> The Legion only rallies around Caesar, so when he's dead, they're fucked.
[0:18:14] <+vampirate1> @AngriestPat The legion has a plan, evil as it is, to bring back civilization.
[0:18:14] <+DespondentSloth> And their system supposedly works back in Arizona
[0:18:15] <%OwlLightningMage> The Institute are wasted potential as shit
[0:18:16] <$codussalpha> Our guiding principle: SLAVERY
[0:18:16] <%InsaneJackLondon> Legion: Power = Right
[0:18:17] <Mangahero18> Banzai Legion! Banzai Slavery!
[0:18:17] <ThePicklesAgain> i dunno, Jericho was pretty stupid in Fallou- oh wait, wrong game
[0:18:19] <%AncelDeLambert> Legion has REASONS for being horrible monsters
[0:18:25] <UltravioIent> Arent legion and enclave identical? Stability and peace through harsh means and authoritorian regime
[0:18:28] <+boredpantz> Pat you could argue that the institute is the best option since you can atleast become the leader
[0:18:30] <Gruhunchously> Ceasar has a guiding principle, but most of his men are too brainwashed and uneducated to understand it.
[0:18:30] <DREAM_BISON> terrible story writers just make the bad guy "lets kill everyone"
[0:18:31] <%AncelDeLambert> "Yo, shit's rough, only rough men will survive."
[0:18:34] <%JJCheeker> Legion are retarded though they can't even say Caesar right
[0:18:35] <rufus2k2> Hey what the heck, where' the RE2 stream without the timer?!
[0:18:37] <DarkKnightGrave> BUT SLAVERY THO
[0:18:38] <+shadowace2400> nobody knew he was a computer
[0:18:40] <jimmypurple> what is house generally placed at morally?
[0:18:42] <%FrostMass22> Enclave doesn't enslave and rape people
[0:18:44] <Etherealizer> people seem to forget that modern society is built on things like the Legion in NV lol
[0:18:48] <%snow_bush> But our president had a dog! A programmed dog! Cyber Dog!
[0:18:48] <Calek> @UltravioIent except the Enclave are race purists
[0:18:48] <mypalkevin> @angriestpat Pat, did you hear about the Randy Pitchford scandal going around right now?
[0:18:49] <+jisang0415> PROFLIGATE DETECTED
[0:18:52] <Lacharoo> Institute has a way more arguable point.
[0:18:53] <+RC_S3kshun8> @AngriestPat did you burn through the rest of your Dummy RE2 accounts?
[0:18:54] <rufus2k2> @JJCheeker strangeBruh
[0:19:05] <synthcutter> legion are slavers, NCR are commies, institute are...slavers? Khans are barbarians
[0:19:05] <@JustinianKnight> Pally is the most straightforward
[0:19:08] <+shadowace2400> Nobody knew eden was a computer. He kept it a secret from everyone
[0:19:10] <+Ciphris> paladin is good for making up healer fuck ups
[0:19:11] <$codussalpha> wait, ehat did he say about paladin?
[0:19:14] <DarkKnightGrave> Same here. Fuck TV.
[0:19:17] <%FrostMass22> Institute is literally an authoritarian regime guilty of murder.
[0:19:18] <Mangahero18> Look at this smug mutherfuker.
[0:19:21] <%D33TR> paladin it is then
[0:19:24] <+eldritchhorrortwitchchat> Damn and I was hoping bonerlands 3 would be a game why did ford have to pitch his randy all over his office?
[0:19:27] <+JediWomprat> atpCap

[0:35:40] <%HRDSalami654> My favorite huge racists!
[0:35:41] <Worldbrand> it's because power armor is cool
[0:35:41] <%lewdskeletor13> FUCK THE LEGION apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:35:41] <ScreamingMeat> They look cool
[0:35:42] <+cerberuscarmine> they look cool
[0:35:42] <slothermun27> aren't the brotherhood extremely racist
[0:35:42] <Calek> is it because they have technology
[0:35:43] <%TheSpiritof2277> BoS is the best written, but they're a bunch of shitlords
[0:35:45] <+cerberuscarmine> XD
[0:35:45] <%PaladinDupre> Power Armor is trash tho
[0:35:45] <%Raxus_Secundus> Because you like big armor?

[0:35:53] <+Tarheelg23> Solid reasoning imo
[0:35:53] <Mr_Strut> But they love lasers
[0:35:53] <%InsaneJackLondon> MMM GUNS
[0:35:53] <raminnoodle420> Is it because they too stay in their bunkers all day?
[0:35:54] <+TastySammiches> the brotherhood is just a bunch of dicks
[0:35:54] <%GarbageNirvana> Technology is pretty rad
[0:35:55] <kingurandumo> Because you can mr sandman every single one of them and hide their bodies behind the lockers
[0:35:55] <gustavozxd> only praise i heard for red dead 2 are the usual empty words like "immersive single player experience"
[0:35:55] <the_red_comet_uc> I am with Pat here
[0:35:55] <ScreamingMeat> Fuck that toaster Pat
[0:35:56] <awsomesaucekirby> SO DOES ENCLAVE

[0:35:57] <%Shikari21> BOS is the best fuck you guys
[0:35:58] <JDRK> same
[0:35:59] <+SpamKingRathalos> Brotherhood of sissies
[0:35:59] <fruit_pie_the_magician> Then why no energy weapons?
[0:35:59] <Izuurus> bethesda whitewashed them in fallout 3
[0:36:00] <%NightOwlSam> steal it all Pat
[0:36:00] <%cherubsanonymous> You? Nooo!
[0:36:00] <%AncelDeLambert> The Brotherhood would live forever as toilets, if they could
[0:36:01] <%Ferakin> But they don't want to give you the technology, Pat
[0:36:03] <DatAsuna> That's how it is in this bitch of an eath
[0:36:05] <Darren716> boomers have bigger ones tho
[0:36:06] <Bouldus> i actually really like the Enclave
[0:36:07] <%Cavumentum> @AngriestPat get a super sledge and crush them like cans of ravioli with a hammer
[0:36:08] <dekkitout> and here i thought he was a caveman
[0:36:08] <%PROUD2beGINGER> i love guns yee haw bang bang
[0:36:08] <%brave_sj> But they all have energy weapons
[0:36:08] <%ElenaManetta> Aren't they like, cult-ish about technology though.
[0:36:09] <baronvonbirman> When do we get the frikken guns!
[0:36:09] <FeelinNifty> tecmology. is it good?
[0:36:09] <+Ciphris> without technology we wouldn't have video games
[0:36:10] <DirtyDeedsDunDirtCheap> @angriestpat so does the Enclave and Boomers
[0:36:10] <%thatother1dude> Kind of ironic that Pat likes Brotherhood considering he doesn't like energy weapons.
[0:36:11] <%PlaneWalkerDavid> Yet no energy weapons
[0:36:11] <+Reaper102388> Technology killed my dog
[0:36:11] <%kiiiirsten> wow I missed one stream and we have Veronica RIP

[0:36:19] <Tucker0603> @angriestpat BUT YOU SAID PLASMA AND LASER WEAPONS SUCk?!?
[0:36:21] <+Flambage> Boomers have even bigger guns @AngriestPat

[0:36:23] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm glad Pat is rolling with best girl
[0:36:25] <$D4C_Trice> but the BoS don't use guns they use lasers.
[0:36:27] <%DavidSanChan> Tall shelf technology is your downfall
[0:36:29] <YourFalloutCompanion> Ooh Veronica, last I saw of this was Bright

[0:39:25] <%lewdskeletor13> Join the xenophobic and seclusionist cult!
[0:39:27] <%ElenaManetta> Power armor with a personality would be a slow, old, smelly dog. You think, cool a dog, fun, but he keeps farting and sleeping and kind of a hassle.

[0:39:41] <%brave_sj> Welcome to Hidden Valley Kappa
[0:39:41] <synthcutter> FO4 is shitty period
[0:39:47] <Fujiwara_92> the real reason to romance Veronica is cause she's a punch girl PogChamp
[0:39:48] <gustavozxd> holy shit that's a morrowind ass dialogue list
[0:39:50] <TranquilTurnip> Wouldn't dirt from boots get on you when you sleep, if your bed is under those floor grates
[0:39:50] <lautalocos> whats wrong with your face?
[0:39:51] <kingra> NOSE
[0:39:51] <+SpamKingRathalos> FO4 was shitty
[0:39:52] <Lurantis_> To be fair I wouldn’t sell my advanced technology to some random fuck head either
[0:39:53] <Zzross_the_savagezz> Fuck Torres, steal her gauss rifle
[0:39:55] <natebud> veronica looks ROUGH
[0:39:55] <Gruhunchously> Half the people in this game are xenophobic seclusionists.
[0:39:55] <$D4C_Trice> @screamingmeat most things in FO4 were done shittily.
[0:39:55] <$codussalpha> @ElenaManetta wasnt there power armor in Fallout 3 with the personality of a Mr. Gutsy?
[0:39:56] <+ShlickShlocks> Here's a fun fact: New Vegas' codename while it was in development was 'Spot Yuri lowenthall'
[0:39:56] <%lewdskeletor13> You can’t romance her
[0:39:58] <%CwutGaming> apatDab apatDab apatDab
[0:39:58] <d_k_xardas> never forget, they cut the cass romance
[0:39:58] <%ElenaManetta> FO4 has some of the best partners, though
[0:40:03] <Zomo_101> that face WutFace
[0:40:04] <jimmypurple> im patiently waiting for him to draw his weapon so i can see his build lol
[0:40:06] <%Shooterboy23> who the fuck is veronica
[0:40:08] <Izuurus> gaunt-ass facemods
[0:40:12] <%JJCheeker> The only thing I like about fallout 4 is the Under Armour for the Brotherhood
[0:40:15] <%Shooterboy23> i beat this game 3 times and i dunno who the fuck veronica is
[0:40:16] <cant_pick_a_name> if you like FO4 you're literally Hitler
[0:40:17] <gustavozxd> you say a single word to a dude and he tells you a goddamn 10 hours story
[0:40:17] <+SpamKingRathalos> But not as shit was 76 was

[0:40:20] <%kiiiirsten> hi chef
[0:40:20] <%InsaneJackLondon> Hey Pat
[0:40:21] <Gorgen> at least in FO4 you could put robo waifu in a synth body
[0:40:21] <mr_slaide> Hey there, fellow kids.
[0:40:23] <FeelinNifty> look at all these nerds
[0:40:26] <%SiameseSneeze> Medic Power Armor Prototype was the shit, but... Old Olney...
[0:40:26] <llpanic> You can't romance Cass either BibleThump
[0:40:27] <%sparrrow_> those robes are so sick
[0:40:28] <Gruhunchously> Remember, in order to actually get Veronica's quest, you have to go to three trigger locations.
[0:40:30] <kingurandumo> They might as well be children
[0:40:31] <%ElenaManetta> Nick Valentine is a such a cool motherfucker
[0:40:31] <VeryTricky> theyre kids to you
[0:40:32] <%lewdskeletor13> @cant_pick_a_name Oh hush children
[0:40:33] <+IronPickle> It's charcoal

[0:40:42] <%AncelDeLambert> They're Grease kids
[0:40:43] <zafooru> !uptime
[0:40:43] <Mangahero18> Personally I think F04 has the most realistic implementation of Power Armor. Though Im disappointed you can just use it as soon as you find it since in previous entries it was well established if you dont have proper training you are just as like to rip yourself apart trying to operate it.
[0:40:43] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 40m 45s.
[0:40:44] <Hazard_Kujacker> FO4 only had Nick Valentine and that's it. McCready gets a pass because of troactive memes
[0:40:46] <%Raxus_Secundus> Veronica is art of the BoS and therefore has no chill
[0:40:46] <DarkKnightGrave> Hey Ch- I mean Pat.
[0:40:47] <%RascheTheRabbit> There we go
[0:40:48] <Gruhunchously> Don't worry about it.
[0:40:49] <%OwlLightningMage> Veronica is best girl
[0:40:50] <Fujiwara_92> can't romance Cass BibleThump why obsidian?
[0:40:51] <%Raxus_Secundus> part*
[0:40:52] <FeelinNifty> more nerds
[0:40:53] <+SpamKingRathalos> Veronica is bae who punches things for a living
[0:40:53] <dekkitout> how do you do, fellow squires
[0:40:57] <%aivalera> @angriestpat Are you pro mcnamera or pro harden?
[0:40:57] <ThePicklesAgain> Veronica is that girl with a secret
[0:40:59] <ScreamingMeat> FO4 is not shit, but it is a bad Fallout game. If it kept the Gunplay but had the same depth as New Vegas or even FO1 and 2 then it would have been the best Fallout ever

[0:51:19] <futa_friday> Don' help hardin, he's an actual bastard
[0:51:21] <ThePicklesAgain> ... I am getting a LOT of Omikron flashbacks from this place. Are we supposed to buy this guy a Porno Poster?
[0:51:21] <Mr_Strut> Why is there a lockdown again?
[0:51:22] <%laserbeaming> Don't replace the dude, just kill them all
[0:51:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Christ this really is a cult
[0:51:26] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Coup that bitch
[0:51:28] <TheEnablerr> Hardin is right though.
[0:51:28] <PineappleBison> No effort bald is 100000x better than combover
[0:51:29] <stratfel112> Hardin is alright, he's just heavily mislead
[0:51:34] <donny_pandairaz> INSTALL AN UPDATE
[0:51:35] <Izuurus> maybe the baldness is a tonsure?
[0:51:42] <%OwlLightningMage> Just eat metal LUL
[0:51:45] <synthcutter> MUTINY
[0:51:49] <floatRand> Oops, I might have been up too late, since apparently you are streaming.
[0:51:50] <ThePicklesAgain> SPACE MUTINY
[0:51:51] <Gruhunchously> I forgot about Hardin? What does he do if you help him?
[0:51:54] <HannibalBeerus> SCROLLS
[0:51:58] <+canabananilism> Lockdown is because they all nearly died in open combat with the NCR at Helios one
[0:51:58] <%manwithboxonhead> The Brotherhood of Steel is a toned down Priesthood of Mars.
[0:52:03] <+Tarheelg23> is the Elder just a really old and crotchety motherfucker
[0:52:03] <Parapattern> There seems to be no good reason for the lock down
[0:52:08] <$CrazierCaptDice> You can lift the lockdown if you do all of McNamara's quests anyway
[0:52:08] <+TastySammiches> Hardin's not wrong, but he's definitely an asshole
[0:52:11] <+cherokee2391> "replaced"
[0:52:15] <%Jpdodds> BUT WEHO WOULD YOU FIGHT
[0:52:15] <ScreamingMeat> Breed some BOS to be food
[0:52:17] <%snow_bush> Purge raiders, get strong
[0:52:22] <$konekoryugamine> Not liking where this is going. Nieschze was right
[0:52:26] <ThePicklesAgain> "I'm the most qualified person I know"
[0:52:27] <JoshyJ> make the brotherhood great again
[0:52:30] <Hydrapissed> Bald evil
[0:52:30] <TranquilTurnip> Apparently Hardin doesn't have the courage either, seeing as hes asking you to do it
[0:52:36] <%Jpdodds> Pat, do not help this man
[0:52:37] <%lewdskeletor13> I really really dislike the Brotherhood
[0:52:38] <%PipIV> good for you
[0:52:39] <Gorgen> The gang starts a coup
[0:52:40] <%sparrrow_> build a wall around the bunker!
[0:52:46] <%OwlLightningMage> I forget exactly why, but I remember Hardin being a dick
[0:52:52] <Mangahero18> Here is a question. If the Brotherhood here doesnt accept outsiders normally then how do they keep their population stable? The Answer; I N C E S T
[0:52:52] <+BishopBain> Yes, Pat, put the fascist in charge. It'll be fine. 4Head
[0:52:55] <FaryaAndWolyo> Don’t do it! Just talk to the elder!
[0:52:55] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@pede2011) (warning)
[0:52:59] <FoxInABeret> "I, Paladin Hardin, have a dream!"
[0:53:02] <$CrazierCaptDice> @AngriestPat Do all of Maccy McNamara's quests
[0:53:07] <JoshyJ> do it PogChamp
[0:53:08] <TheEnablerr> He's not really an asshole, just frustrated and with good reason
[0:53:10] <%lewdskeletor13> @mangahero18 This is legit canon
[0:53:11] <NinjaTB> so, we figured out how to get the pc version of the resident evil demo to not lock you out yet?
[0:53:12] <Hydrapissed> No drugs for da kids
[0:53:12] <ScreamingMeat> @OwlLightningMage He wants to start a war with the NCR
[0:53:14] <%Jpdodds> @Mangahero18 They used to let more people in IIRC
[0:53:19] <$konekoryugamine> I do NOT trust this guy.
[0:53:20] <+Tarheelg23> Make the Paladins Great Again
[0:53:22] <$konekoryugamine> Something about him.
[0:53:22] <PineappleBison> Fuck you all, AD VICTORIUM
[0:53:22] <$CrazierCaptDice> they literally find out who they're the least related to in the bunker and bang
[0:53:25] <%TheSpiritof2277> Don't help Hardin build his
[0:53:30] <Mangahero18> Well now its all sister fukking
[0:53:32] <%aivalera> Freakin’ hardass is such a jackass
[0:53:36] <TheChampionofBoxes> He wants to kill as many people as possible
[0:53:37] <+BishopBain> What if, and hear me out, we just kill the current elder? Kappa
[0:53:41] <$SGrim> Make the BOS great again KKona
[0:53:41] <slix343> The brotherhood are hoarder fucks but they are not the NCR
[0:53:43] <Mangahero18> Hot and Sweaty Incest.
[0:53:43] <Blank9> I trust him, he's acting exactly like the brotherhood acts in 1
[0:53:44] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> heh breast
[0:53:46] <lloyddboy> A B R E A S T
[0:53:46] <KoopaPrez> As someone just listening in the background, thanks for reading out your choices Pat!
[0:53:48] <Zalthia> Don’t do it!
[0:53:49] <%OwlLightningMage> Abreast PogChamp Kappa
[0:53:54] <%LowBatteryLife> Yes, you'll become powerful by sending out patrols you stopped years ago because too many patrols were lost because you're a bunch of weak bitches nowadays.
[0:53:55] <%Raxus_Secundus> How would that arouse less suspicion? A stranger shows up asking how to dispose of a military-ish leader, and no one acts as if that is a credible threat?
[0:53:55] <%kiiiirsten> abreast apatSmug
[0:53:57] <%chungyboy> he says the brotherhood will be your ally but the only way to have an alliance with the brotherhood is if the other headmaster stays in control
[0:53:59] <+IronPickle> did you hear that, he wants some titties
[0:54:01] <lloyddboy> BIG SNITCH
[0:54:07] <natebud> I always had bad feeling about this guy, never saw what happened if you helped him
[0:54:07] <$konekoryugamine> Damn it I knew there's be people who latch onto the word "abreast".
[0:54:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> Never trust a Boomer
[0:54:11] <+BishopBain> Heheh, abreast. That's like boobs. Kappa
[0:54:14] <%SaltyDongs> Boomers
[0:54:16] <%lewdskeletor13> “Let’s hoard all this tech and cosplay as knights” Basically the Brotherhood
[0:54:19] <stratfel112> the best choice is *** so do whatever you want
[0:54:20] <+TastySammiches> on the map, is that...Anor Londo?
[0:54:20] <gustavozxd> YURI AGAIN
[0:54:21] <+canabananilism> Hardin is ultra committed to the brotherhood’s mantra. Which is to hoard as much tech as possible regardless of what it costs. That’s why he’s an ass
[0:54:22] <%finaltrinity5> yuri again
[0:54:23] <mayorrev> STFU BOOMER
[0:54:24] <$SGrim> MONSTER rooWut

[0:54:36] <donny_pandairaz> Yuri on Yuri action
[0:54:37] <fehraf> why is Yuri everywhere?
[0:54:38] <TheEnablerr> McNamara: We're locked in here, we're gonna die in here, I know. Hardin: we need to do SOMETHING at least dammit.
[0:54:38] <Pookiedaexzile> PIDERMAN

[0:54:47] <zeroraider> Yuri on Steel
[0:54:49] <Mangahero18> Like 90% of the cast in this game is Yuri Lowenthal.
[0:54:52] <Zalthia> I knew that voice was familiar!!!
[0:54:56] <TranquilTurnip> Oops all Yuri
[0:54:57] <%PipIV> Yuri clone wars
[0:55:02] <%manwithboxonhead> Except me
[0:55:03] <Mangahero18> The other 10 percent is Yuri doing a funny southern accent.
[0:55:04] <stratfel112> his face is weird
[0:55:05] <%lewdskeletor13> Yuri and Liam are this entire cast
[0:55:10] <ThePicklesAgain> welcome in Yurikron
[0:55:11] <$konekoryugamine> heh
[0:55:15] <Ghostars> This Warframe update looks weird. Nice to see so much Operator Gameplay.

[0:55:21] <%vampireinarm> Yuri for Smash
[0:55:22] <Zalthia> Don’t forget Laura Bailey
[0:55:24] <+crunchygrl> yuri and liam obrien just showed up to obsidian and fought the rest of the vo cast for supremacy
[0:55:29] <donny_pandairaz> Fallout: New Yuri
[0:55:30] <Parapattern> This guy should have been way older
[0:55:31] <gustavozxd> I don't have any problem with more yuri I mean you know
[0:55:32] <%OwlLightningMage> I hope Outer Worlds doesn't have this voice actor problem LUL
[0:55:37] <prime_name> Vuri is in Smash

[0:55:57] <%Mornaka> The war between Yuri and Liam rages on...
[0:55:58] <%lewdskeletor13> Yuri Lowenthal, Liam O’Brien, and Laura Bailey, the New Vegas trinity
[0:55:58] <%vampireinarm> Fallout Man for Smash
[0:56:03] <%Ferakin> Liam O'Brien actually isn't in this game, it's just Yuri's sick Liam impression
[0:56:06] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I feel like the first thing a game like this needs to do is hire like 300 voice actors.
[0:56:14] <ScreamingMeat> I hope Outer Worlds will have some kind of Power Armor system
[0:56:14] <$konekoryugamine> Sometimes it can't be done.
[0:56:17] <pede2011> Wasnt one in the crater near black mountain?
[0:56:17] <+fantom_flasch> Sasuke is the Hokage of the Village Hidden in the Nuclear Wasteland

[0:56:23] <%cureneckbeard> Yuri is literally at least 61 different characters in this game.
[0:56:28] <Gruhunchously> Funny thing is, Laura Bailey only voices three characters in this game.
[0:56:28] <slix343> Ms, Frizzle endangers so many kids man
[0:56:29] <$konekoryugamine> Traiming?

[0:59:54] <FoxInABeret> I remember cleaning all the stuff out of this place to sell it before I blew it up. Fun times.
[0:59:56] <%kiiiirsten> Pat has too many bad boy points

[1:00:02] <Kataguro> I'm surprised she isn't Yuri too
[1:00:03] <+crunchygrl> you gotta boost your karma so you can hang out with cass
[1:00:03] <TheEnablerr> @AngriestPat might be for next stream, but there's a mod for Cass so she doesn't leave if you're evil/bad karma/use drugs
[1:00:04] <lich995> Have we cleansed the Fiends yet?
[1:00:05] <Hazard_Kujacker> @mastertwin2 and dont forget the rare instances of Sam Reigel. That's a 3rd of the cast of Critical Role already
[1:00:05] <+TastySammiches> finally someone who isn't Yuri Lowenthall
[1:00:06] <+BishopBain> Damn, not very personable. Kappa

[1:00:10] <%CollinsOfBodom> And if you gaze long enough into the Yuri...
[1:00:10] <MettleWolf> I would have loved it if her voice was also Yuri.
[1:00:10] <%manwithboxonhead> Fuck it
[1:00:14] <JoshyJ> YOINKED
[1:00:15] <gustavozxd> @lewdskeletor13 all that experience voicing every single character in fallout nv paid off Kappa for real though he's great
[1:00:16] <+FackinCrazy> But wait that is yuri
[1:00:17] <+SpamKingRathalos> ONE PISTOL

[1:00:39] <Tucker0603> SuPPLY ME WITH PUSS!!!
[1:00:44] <PowerfulBlackGangs> You are freaking out over 1 gun but can give away supplies?
[1:00:46] <Bomtrak> buy a laser pistol from her and hand it back
[1:00:50] <%Raxus_Secundus> Her: Nothing more to talk about
[1:00:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Is this Yuri too?
[1:00:52] <+mastertwin2> @Hazard_Kujacker I think the VA Caster at Zenimax REALLY likes Critical Role
[1:00:59] <%Raxus_Secundus> Pat: But I need shit
[1:01:00] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> why do the brotherhood buy NCR money?
[1:01:01] <Kataguro> Mmm, Brush Gun
[1:01:03] <%Shady_Zaku> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[1:01:05] <Gruhunchously> If anyone is in need of NCR money, it's the Brotherhood.
[1:01:07] <%Jpdodds> Brush gun woolieGASM
[1:01:11] <fruit_pie_the_magician> DO THE EdE QUEST
[1:01:14] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> All this Yuri reminded me of the Yuri in Death Stranding. Then I remembered that Death stranding was a thing
[1:01:14] <Zalthia> This game came out before critical role
[1:01:15] <%Shady_Zaku> why did you sell NCR money
[1:01:15] <%sparrrow_> In the Spiderman Yuri plays spiderman and his wife plays the character Yuri, so Yuri has to call his wife by his own name LUL
[1:01:16] <%PROUD2beGINGER> ballistic fists are fun
[1:01:23] <$SGrim> @Jpdodds Medicine Stick rooGasm
[1:01:23] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> oH really

[1:01:29] <%joylent_blue> FFS
[1:01:30] <%lewdskeletor13> Is Yuri in Death Stranding?
[1:01:30] <natebud> literally called "Missing Laser Pistol" when you find it.
[1:01:31] <+Tarheelg23> GIANCARLO???
[1:01:33] <+TastySammiches> why would the brotherhood buy NCR money from you? 🤔
[1:01:33] <+SWFanatic> why would they wear power armor when they're just doing paperwork and bs
[1:01:36] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> wait was that ALSO YURI
[1:01:39] <%finaltrinity5> scranton
[1:01:41] <%joylent_blue> YES IT WAS
[1:01:47] <martmartez> y hentais has unhealthy sized tiddies?
[1:01:50] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat check the classroom
[1:01:52] <$CrazierCaptDice> To debase the value of NCR money
[1:01:54] <BlueLunecy> All these inbred Yuri-men look the same
[1:01:54] <raminnoodle420> Gotta stretch out that Yuri
[1:01:55] <Hazard_Kujacker> @mastertwin2 to be fair New Vegas was way before Critical Role started. But it's curious how they have been together in projects for a while
[1:01:59] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @martmartez big good
[1:02:02] <+crunchygrl> stanton hangs out in one of the barracks rooms or the classroom
[1:02:02] <Gruhunchously> It is nice that Veronica has dialogue with so many Brotherhood members.
[1:02:02] <hassanico> Initiate Stanton is one of the black guys in normal brotherhood clothes

[1:02:18] <MettleWolf> Who's this not Yuri?
[1:02:22] <$SGrim> @Jpdodds Lil' Devil rooD
[1:02:22] <%TheDude8D> remember in the olden times warriors would shit in their pants because it was too much of a pain to take the armor off, i think this is what the brotherhood does
[1:02:22] <+TastySammiches> NOT YURI Kreygasm

[1:02:55] <RorschachAttack> lets see if pat can ay my name right
[1:02:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Everyone sounds like Yuri cause they love incest
[1:03:00] <Zalthia> Don’t do it Pat!
[1:03:02] <%snow_bush> Brotherhood of Steel? More like Brotherhood of Cowards!
[1:03:04] <Dragonfang1337> not yuri's get put on a list
[1:03:04] <RorschachAttack> unlike all other streamers
[1:03:04] <YourFalloutCompanion> Came for Pat, stayed for Yuri

[1:03:35] <+SpamKingRathalos> NCR aka the imperial guard
[1:03:37] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Needed time for furry porn
[1:03:38] <Zalthia> Elijah was kicked out because he wasn’t a Yuri
[1:03:39] <RorschachAttack> most people screw it up SOO BAD
[1:03:41] <%Ferakin> Actually, every voice in this game is Yuri's, not just the Brotherhood's
[1:03:45] <MettleWolf> Wearing that armor all day must be so uncomfortable.
[1:03:47] <GoWestyy> He's a ncr spy since it isn't Yuri
[1:03:47] <natebud> Go punch that kid out and take his ray gun.
[1:03:47] <%lewdskeletor13> Elijah is really just Dutch
[1:03:48] <%Ferakin> He's the greatest VA of our time
[1:03:50] <+SpamKingRathalos> Drown them in blood
[1:03:51] <lich995> What is this? Foreshadowing? In an RPG?
[1:03:52] <Darren716> #elijahdidnothingwrong

[1:04:01] <martmartez> Is that Yuri Low and Tall?
[1:04:02] <+DespondentSloth> they think he's dead LUL
[1:04:04] <+SpamKingRathalos> Elijah was Dutch, believe in me

[1:04:27] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s dead... Dead Money apatDab
[1:04:29] <%manwithboxonhead> HERESY
[1:04:29] <alexandrecau> Elijah Wood
[1:04:31] <ScreamingMeat> He's not a Yuri
[1:04:32] <$CrazierCaptDice> Dead Money grows on you.
[1:04:32] <%joylent_blue> crunchygrl hard agree
[1:04:35] <adamisfruit> Elijah is off doing DLC
[1:04:36] <AlasterAngelo> @TastySammiches Ulysses
[1:04:37] <Fujiwara_92> dead Elijah, believe guys, 100% dead Kappa
[1:04:38] <%sparrrow_> in Pennsylvania
[1:04:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TastySammiches Elijah
[1:04:40] <Gruhunchously> Elijah is easily the bigger asshole.
[1:04:41] <+crunchygrl> mostly bc of christine
[1:04:42] <mr_slaide> It's about loyalty ARTHUR!
[1:04:42] <Zalthia> @lich995 oh my god the dlcs were so well foreshadowed it’s almost like elements that were supposed to be in the main game were cut and moved
[1:04:44] <%InsaneJackLondon> time to do DLC
[1:04:46] <natebud> @crunchygrl i'll say 2nd best, not even fair comparing it to Old World Blues
[1:04:47] <RecklessPrinny> dead money be hot garbage
[1:04:47] <TheEnablerr> Elijah is the biggest asshole FOR SURE
[1:04:48] <%Mornaka> Beuller

[1:04:53] <%snow_bush> Bueller
[1:04:58] <Parapattern> I Do Like Dean Domino
[1:04:59] <Gorgen> Yuri has an impressive voice range
[1:04:59] <Hazard_Kujacker> @crunchygrl it is a good survival horror game in my RPG but New Vegas Woolie tho
[1:05:01] <slix343> No no Sheuller

[1:05:11] <MettleWolf> Hello Butterface
[1:05:11] <%lewdskeletor13> SHAUN
[1:05:12] <%Mornaka> Schuler
[1:05:13] <%joylent_blue> i like the vocal fry in her voice
[1:05:25] <ThePicklesAgain> doctor, I got a fever ... and the only treatment.. is more Power Armor
[1:05:25] <alexandrecau> oh yes she is a bitch toward veronica
[1:05:28] <GarbageQueenEllie> Shaaaaaaaawn
[1:05:28] <Videogamer4> SHAUN
[1:05:29] <$CrazierCaptDice> you guys know about the ending where you team up with Elder Elijah and invade the MOjave Wasteland with the Holograms from the Sierra Madre?
[1:05:33] <ScreamingMeat> Not really
[1:05:34] <+TastySammiches> Dead Money is one of those games/DLCs that's great but only when you're not playing it
[1:05:42] <AlasterAngelo> wait how do they get stung through the power armor
[1:05:42] <%PipIV> please dont. I have a wound there
[1:05:42] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Initiates are usually in the classroom. Left after coming down the main stairs in the fork covered by turrets.
[1:05:44] <+TastySammiches> when you're playing it it's just torture
[1:05:44] <natebud> Besides we shouldn't do dead money until pat can lift at least 10 bars of gold.
[1:05:44] <ZNC1990> @mettlewolf but they all have the same body...
[1:05:50] <+crunchygrl> i supuhvise
[1:05:51] <%OwlLightningMage> @CrazierCaptDice Yes. That ending kicks ass PogChamp
[1:05:52] <%Raxus_Secundus> Throwing shade
[1:05:53] <ThatManSam> She's no 90's rogue but her voice is still very very nice
[1:05:54] <TheEnablerr> Dead Money is great. The first time.
[1:05:58] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TastySammiches I enjoy playing Dead Money
[1:05:59] <%lewdskeletor13> Dead Money has a good story but garbage gameplay
[1:06:03] <%Mornaka> oh my
[1:06:07] <Gruhunchously> Oh dear.
[1:06:12] <Zalthia> I liked Dead Money, but it got too easy after a while
[1:06:19] <jijipose> Regular Randy Pitchford over here
[1:06:20] <stratfel112> god her voice is really low energy
[1:06:20] <Hazard_Kujacker> Dead money it's a good atmospheric survival horror game
[1:06:20] <%OwlLightningMage> I liked Dead Money way more after the first run

[1:20:59] <%Demon_Shadow4> computer hacking in this game is super confusing I never understood it maybe because i never played any fallout games lol

[1:21:34] <+Kriptin> @Sphincter_Spelunker Basically obey superiors and the superiors need to relay orders to the direct inferior

[1:21:46] <%manwithboxonhead> Are we in The Suffering?
[1:21:47] <+Kriptin> Elder can't give a recruit orders
[1:21:49] <BeefyQueefer> The chain of command is the chain the leader beats you with until you follow orders.
[1:21:52] <$CrazierCaptDice> don't do it
[1:21:54] <%PauliusMaximus> gets all the dicks hard that watkins girl
[1:22:02] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat also, if you chose Harkin you can't ally them with NCR, thus limiting the effect you can have on the Ending.
[1:22:04] <%sparrrow_> DONT
[1:22:07] <natebud> Hardy Boy
[1:22:11] <futa_friday> i would advise not helping Hardin
[1:22:12] <deviljhojho94> Pat n
[1:22:13] <%jimhalla> the apocalypse: giving normal concepts fancy names since the bombs dropped!
[1:22:14] <Conky89> You going for the hardliner to take over BoS? In some missions, the only fate of the Brotherhood will be boom-boom of their base.

[1:22:17] <$SGrim> Hardin* FUCK rooREE
[1:22:17] <Zalthia> Don’t do it

[1:22:27] <%Mr_y1096> it's chain of command but worse!
[1:22:33] <%kiiiirsten> Pat is helping Hardin out of bald solidarity

[1:22:42] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> Watkins and Stenton is what happens when a guy follows his dick into pure trouble. cheer500
[1:22:45] <Izuurus> a kinkier way to say chain of command
[1:22:47] <TheEnablerr> Hardin did nothing wrong
[1:22:48] <%FrostMass22> the BOS in this game are weak and deserve to get dunked on
[1:22:48] <%lewdskeletor13> The Brotherhood tries to act like a military but they literally are just a cult of techno-hoarders
[1:22:49] <Ran196> Follwers best group
[1:22:52] <deviljhojho94> YEAYEAYEAYEAYEA
[1:22:57] <Gruhunchously> Helping Hardin is a bad idea. Also, I think it cuts off Veronica's quest.
[1:22:57] <dekkitout> for safeguards of technology, yall sure are into esoteric concepts
[1:23:01] <+Kriptin> Why help Hardin unless you get a Hardin for incompetent leaders.
[1:23:01] <%punch_ghost> It's an honest shame the Followers get screwed in pretty much every ending
[1:23:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is ditching best girl WutFace

[1:36:03] <%lewdskeletor13> @tastysammiches How are they misguided in the slightest?
[1:36:03] <slothslayer828> Followers of apocalyse is PUNK ROCK

[1:36:26] <+TastySammiches> @lewdskeletor13 Caesar's legion rose out of the followers
[1:36:28] <mightyfat> Big man big balls
[1:36:29] <xennyvs> Nah, theyre not a major faction
[1:36:30] <%Prism_Wing> Great ass hats to the community
[1:36:31] <%mister___doctor> This is my favorite faction
[1:36:33] <$Tuskor13> those damn townies
[1:36:34] <godsabove> MURDER DIXON
[1:36:35] <vincenava94> What’s up little man
[1:36:36] <dukenux> Followers are like Doctors sans frintiers
[1:36:40] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> I hate when people don't do proper mohawks. Do it right, nerd
[1:36:40] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, Caesar was one of the Followers.
[1:36:43] <Sunstalker> codussalpha Probably the druglady from the Khans
[1:36:44] <%Skrypto> Dixon MaFaceÉ
[1:36:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @codussalpha no idea. usually vipers have it
[1:36:49] <TranquilTurnip> "here are all the side quests"
[1:36:49] <%Zaxshimysham> Kiss her on the MOHAWK
[1:36:51] <dukenux> they dont have much political power
[1:36:56] <+TastySammiches> don't get me wrong the followers are the closest thing this game has to good guys but they're still a buncha dummies
[1:36:57] <natebud> Townies trying to take over Bullworth again
[1:37:03] <Hazard_Kujacker> Man, its so sad that there's no real good ending for the Followers outside of NCR ending
[1:37:03] <Valentinius_Anodyne> I guess that Wildcard is the closest to a Followers ending
[1:37:10] <+Exyoh> The Followers have a great chance of succeeding with a gun-toting maniac to get the nasties outta the way
[1:37:11] <jobbedbone> Merchants huh
[1:37:12] <ThePicklesAgain> Maybe we can find more Blue Blood at the docks-- oh wait, wrong game
[1:37:12] <%lewdskeletor13> @tastysammiches Rogue members started it, how does that make them responsible?
[1:37:16] <slothslayer828> ceaser thinks followers are idiots
[1:37:24] <%Skrypto> Glorp
[1:37:27] <%Zaxshimysham> the only right choice is MR House
[1:37:27] <dukenux> of couese he does
[1:37:28] <Hazard_Kujacker> @Valentinius_Anodyne and they get fucked in that ending
[1:37:29] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> That was a loud gulp
[1:37:29] <popsnapcatchland> I always hated her ridiculous Mohawk
[1:37:32] <squareknot20> I know an attic when i see one
[1:37:39] <+ChaosVulpes> You know what cures addiction? A bullet to the brain. :3
[1:37:39] <hassanico> @Hazard_Kujacker You can help them in the YesMan ending as well
[1:37:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Zaxshimysham damn right
[1:37:46] <Conky89> At least the Legion lets the followers go if Caeser remains alive.
[1:37:48] <Hydrapissed> he could do it drunk

[1:43:49] <xennyvs> Yeah theres no Ceaser-favoring companions without mods
[1:43:51] <%AncelDeLambert> @tuskor13 Obsidian did that on purpose. To be selfish is to be alone.

[1:43:55] <SailingSaturn> Veronica looks weird now cirThink
[1:43:56] <HannibalBeerus> @Tuskor13 I think it's just to paint how bad he is honestly
[1:43:59] <Jaysky> Cause Caesar is a dick Tuskor13
[1:44:00] <linklol321> I know that Raul doesnt hate ceasar, he hes been in the east, so he understands the legion
[1:44:01] <Gruhunchously> Strangely enough, Raul seems okay with Caesar's Legion. He's neutral at least.

[2:15:20] <DarkKnightGrave> This Machine? Does it summon Team Dark? Kappa
[2:15:22] <ThePicklesAgain> maybe I can Romance the MooBot
[2:15:22] <$konekoryugamine> I came across a dead body stuck in a water mill once.
[2:15:27] <$konekoryugamine> Does that count as a bug?

[2:15:45] <deviljhojho94> Kill eet anywas, eh?
[2:15:45] <%ElenaManetta> There are NO Npcs in Fallout
[2:15:46] <ThePicklesAgain> that Is an NPC
[2:15:50] <%aishman> Pat can you use the Anti Material Rifle??

[2:16:24] <dekkitout> ice cream, now i am your messiah
[2:16:25] <GarbageQueenEllie> Was that just a guess? Hence the Luck check?
[2:16:32] <dukenux> isnt that a low int answer
[2:16:32] <$PaleBloodInk> The lack of Strength won't be a problem once he gets to Old World Blues. A certain perk will take care of that.
[2:16:33] <%brave_sj> It's there

[2:16:43] <+ogrest> NPCs, in my fallout?! what the fuck bethsoft, why would we want this, what we really want is "emergent events" and "games as a service" and "shitty nylon tote bags"
[2:16:52] <Gruhunchously> @TranquilTurnip No, the epitome of that is fixing Caesar's brain cancer with high luck and low medicine.

[2:19:24] <%the_mental_punk> ok so i understand how the male lone survivor can use power armor because he was a soldier. what about his wife and most of your companions whats the reason there? or is the reason fuck you thats why.
[2:19:27] <%RascheTheRabbit> Guys its been really fun chillin' with everyone. I'm gonna join some friendos in-game. Someone Message me when Pat reads my last donation because I really hope Christian reaches out to me

[2:19:54] <%OwlLightningMage> @ogrest I think people are just using it for dupping items. I'm not sure. I know that Bethesda are banning people who enter it instead of removing it all together
[2:19:55] <+ogrest> @the_mental_punk I assume that it's a conceit that you train them using psychic powers
[2:19:57] <+LinkyBinky> That player is RPing as a scientist
[2:19:59] <fiercefiresoul> Paige drank too much alcoholic mustard, that's why she's not on stream with Pat right now.
[2:20:08] <%RascheTheRabbit> @AngriestPat Thanks for the fun dood, tell Paige to keep her big and strong chin up.
[2:20:09] <%Shady_Zaku> Read the holotape

[2:21:39] <%the_mental_punk> @wackyxmand the outfit gives you tue confidence to hack the computer
[2:21:39] <Mnightshyamallama> it is almost like lockpick is a really good skill to level up PAT
[2:21:40] <martmartez> you can climb that
[2:21:42] <+LinkyBinky> In Fallout you have no choice
[2:21:43] <%manwithboxonhead> FortOne 🧠
[2:21:43] <ThePicklesAgain> that's how Pat navigates the real world too
[2:21:50] <PineappleBison> Whew
[2:21:51] <Gruhunchously> I think there's a key around here somewhere. I definately remember getting in this room without lockpick and science.

[2:22:29] <JittersCaffeine> It also gets you a key to this place
[2:22:38] <%Shady_Zaku> question Mega64 Deus Ex hacking

[2:40:04] <KeystoneA1> 45-70 rounds for the brush gun are good. Brush Gun is beastly with 100 guns later in the game
[2:40:04] <PowerfulBlackGangs> And the PINEAPPLES?
[2:40:06] <TheChampionofBoxes> combat armor mark 2
[2:40:07] <%Theophilus567> 45-70 lever action is beast

[2:40:15] <%TheSpiritof2277> there's a unique Magnum that uses 45-70 that's pretty neato
[2:40:15] <$CrazierCaptDice> @AngriestPat all guns that use 45-70 are beasts
[2:40:17] <Mr_Strut> more than enough to kill anything that moves
[2:40:19] <ScreamingMeat> Brushgunn and Medicine Stick
[2:40:21] <%brave_sj> @AngriestPat You should get the WMX mod that lets you mod unique guns like Paciencia
[2:40:23] <%masterpiecejeremy> Hey @AngriestPat. Just introduced my fiancee to HOLD ON and we laughed for an hour straight
[2:40:26] <CopperTucker> I've never actually played this so I am no help
[2:40:27] <roobanguy> And Stay Back! basically makes all shotguns godly
[2:40:28] <@Moobot> I don't know if I can trust that. (@Ugato) (warning)
[2:40:34] <CopperTucker> I'm just here to enjoy the ride

[2:40:55] <Ran196> what about the gun runner beneeth the bridge?
[2:41:00] <Ugato> It's thirty ought six or 30.06
[2:41:00] <clonexsniperx> could he have modded the pacienca?
[2:41:00] <%OwlLightningMage> These are good gun bois and gurls
[2:41:01] <%TheDude8D> can you shoot a person with it
[2:41:02] <ThePicklesAgain> MooBot, you need to learn to Trust us or this relationship is never gonna work

[2:45:51] <Falketh> tried getting back into wow and my soul died again
[2:45:52] <Mechanical_Mayhem> I wonder how many casinos pat has been kicked out of, and how many more he's aiming for, maybe it will transcend New Vegas and bleed into other games
[2:45:52] <Gruhunchously> Benny notices the Courier and starts panicking, but the Courier doesn't care, he just wants to gamble.
[2:45:52] <applesonthemoon> luck is at 10 with the nightwear
[2:45:53] <$NocturneNovember> I'm waiting for it to snow tomorrow so I can potentially get Sunday off

[2:47:37] <Gorgen> @ScreamingMeat he's not even worth it.
[2:47:40] <ThePicklesAgain> I clapped. I clapped when I saw it!
[2:47:40] <+SpamKingRathalos> New Vegas is really really god
[2:47:43] <%PenmanLupine> controversial opinions over here
[2:47:44] <GarbageQueenEllie> I'd say that the casinos alone make it the best
[2:47:47] <thelonechris> PogChamp
[2:47:47] <%PenmanLupine> rarely heard words about such a game
[2:47:49] <%lewdskeletor13> I’d agree
[2:47:50] <%NumbusPlays> FUCK YOU IT'S BLACKJACK!
[2:47:50] <%SergeEXE> @Hazard_Kujacker d'aw, no more community FC? Just a Pat personal one I guess

[2:47:54] <+Warden_Kain> Fav Warframe
[2:47:55] <Jaysky> Very god
[2:47:55] <prime_name> It's not great on console.
[2:47:56] <daisymaisy02> I have no reason to like 4 as much as I do but New Vegas is absolutely the best in the series for me
[2:47:56] <+SpamKingRathalos> and the mods fix up the issues they had from lack of time
[2:47:59] <%BlancoRico> Pat, today I managed to get all the parts for Nova, Mag, mesa and finish zephyr prime.
[2:48:00] <%the_mental_punk> OMikron the nomad soul is more than an rpg it's an EXPERIENCE
[2:48:00] <%OwlLightningMage> This game is no Fallout 4 Kappa
[2:48:02] <%cdrom321> I'm playing Fallout 3 and it's been more interesting watching you play NV.
[2:48:02] <Hazard_Kujacker> @SergeEXE yah
[2:48:02] <%ElenaManetta> Anything with fingernails is my horror
[2:48:02] <zafooru> pat you are small you take less fall damage
[2:48:02] <ThePicklesAgain> ENDLESS PATS
[2:48:03] <$Piemono> @AngriestPat It'd be a longer fall for you
[2:48:04] <+Bob_Tom> they gonna bust ya nuts
[2:48:04] <dekkitout> or do the suge knight
[2:48:06] <Kataguro> The dealer must be so confused
[2:48:06] <+Nymphonomicon> What'd you buff your Luck to play blackjack like this Pat? Are you at 9?
[2:48:06] <DarkKnightGrave> @screamingmeat I like him but he needs a rework.
[2:48:07] <Cobaltor_252> Heard of this mod being worked on that replaces alot of the repeat voice acting in the game and deletes Yuri from it, called Brave New World
[2:48:09] <%TheDude8D> hey pat, how's this streaming feel versus the LP format feel?
[2:48:10] <RetributionP> because it's high and yours shourt
[2:48:10] <heatrashes> first time tuning into pat's nv streams, what ending is he going for? has he said?
[2:48:10] <%manwithboxonhead> If Pat plays Fallout 1, omg it would be hilarious
[2:48:11] <dukenux> I saw black jack an I CLAPPED
[2:48:13] <+Warden_Kain> What's your fav warram go
[2:48:13] <TalisKanju> @angriestpat What are OTHER RPGs of New Vegas's type

[2:48:17] <%lewdskeletor13> FUCK YOU ITS JANUARY
[2:48:17] <Kataguro> He's at 9 Luck + Sexy Sleepwear
[2:48:18] <Conky89> Unless you want GRA stuff.
[2:48:19] <%ElenaManetta> Or bending things backwards that shouldn't go backwards
[2:48:21] <+pl0xzz> "How lucky can one guy be...?"
[2:48:21] <dragoon001914> Money is worthless because of how easy it is to get the gold from Dead Money
[2:48:21] <%SergeEXE> @Hazard_Kujacker Can't we start one behind his back? Call it "Pat's Balls" or something?
[2:48:23] <$SGrim> You stayed on 11?
[2:48:23] <$NocturneNovember> So, on my original NV run, I was ready to claim the Damn for the NCR but then I accidentaly saved over it
[2:48:23] <+Chud_Pudsley> You need 25k for all the Cybernetics @AngriestPat
[2:48:24] <$nademonkey1100> after all the strip casinos we need to get banned from the sierra madre
[2:48:26] <Calek> I watched a video of Fallout 4 New Vegas and it looks greeeat
[2:48:26] <JittersCaffeine> So is Bethesda 1 for 3 on making objectively good fallout games?
[2:48:31] <dukenux> ENDLESS CAPS
[2:48:36] <Hiruzen93> Hasnt brave new world been in the works for years though
[2:48:39] <pede2011> @OwlLightningMage Just lie your fucking ass off. My current job as QA, they ere looking for a Sr. I never worked before and yet, here I am. Just lie!
[2:48:40] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> the dealer must draw to 17 not 16 silly table
[2:48:45] <dukenux> babby
[2:48:45] <%ElenaManetta> Why do they give someone who just won a shit ton of money free food?
[2:48:46] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Zaxshimysham) (warning)
[2:48:46] <lich995> PLEASE
[2:48:47] <%ElenaManetta> As if you can't afford it

[2:48:53] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 48m.
[2:48:58] <%kabermano> Keep playing those gaaaames! Nudge nudge
[2:48:59] <dukenux> please loose
[2:49:00] <Hazard_Kujacker> @SergeEXE We actually did after Stormfeelers disbanded but without him it didn't last long
[2:49:00] <Meekest> Is there a mod where the casinos send gunmen after you after breaking them?
[2:49:01] <+SpamKingRathalos> Keep the caps comin
[2:49:06] <$PaleBloodInk> To encourage them to keep playing, and hopefully get their money back.
[2:49:07] <%Shady_Zaku> NotLikeThis
[2:49:07] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> @ElenaManetta Make them feel like they should come back
[2:49:08] <Kataguro> Varies by house
[2:49:12] <GarbageQueenEllie> When this guy ran over to me for the first time, I nearly soiled myself 'cause I thought he was coming to breakj my thumbs
[2:49:13] <%SergeEXE> @Hazard_Kujacker Makes sense, what a bummer
[2:49:14] <+Nymphonomicon> A weak steak I can cook myself and a bottle of wine. So fancy... :/
[2:49:15] <%ElenaManetta> But they're TAKING ALL THE HOUSE'S MONEY!
[2:49:16] <timmc916> Its a passive agressive steak, its well done
[2:49:16] <%OwlLightningMage> @pede2011 That actually makes me feel better. Thanks for the advice LUL
[2:49:17] <f2ai> is there a Pat glyph in warframe at the moment?
[2:49:17] <%IDTheftVictim> Went ahead and just
[2:49:17] <+Bob_Tom> @AngriestPat yeah, that's what makes card counting a possible thing as well,
[2:49:18] <dakkster> I wish I could put points into IRL luck
[2:49:19] <%IDTheftVictim> ***
[2:49:23] <Gorgen> jermaNosewipe
[2:49:23] <%furiousfurioso> @ElenaManetta basically, seeing someone else win would make others feel like they have a chance... now if he wins TOO much then it becomes a problem
[2:49:26] <%IDTheftVictim> Oh, uh I clipped the start
[2:49:26] <gustavozxd> "deadly poiso-wine added"
[2:49:31] <FoxInABeret> It actually says that on the table. Just noticed that.
[2:49:34] <%giogiothethird> this is satisfying to watch
[2:49:37] <%sparrrow_> cmonBruh Jack
[2:49:39] <+mayiplay> Hey Pat, what's your luck stat?
[2:49:39] <+timblenaut> this deck has SO MANY ACES
[2:49:40] <+SpamKingRathalos> HERE IT COMEs
[2:49:44] <Mr_Strut> Time for slots
[2:49:45] <ScreamingMeat> Might as well be Black Jack
[2:49:46] <Rotharn> They have to hit if you're ahead, if they're 17 or higher they must stand
[2:49:47] <%ElenaManetta> I feel like there is an abnormal number of... Aces... In this deck.
[2:49:48] <TheChampionofBoxes> 10 luck
[2:49:49] <%the_mental_punk> Are poker and yhatzee pretty much the same?
[2:49:51] <+Nymphonomicon> I see the blackjack, but where's the hookers? Make Bender proud, Pat.
[2:49:51] <%Give_Me_Liberty> we're 100% black
[2:49:51] <%Prism_Wing> I have no idea what I'm seeing.
[2:49:51] <TalisKanju> @angriestpat What are Other RPGs of New Vegas's type?

[2:50:10] <ScreamingMeat> We love that you're taking all out money
[2:50:10] <%thatother1dude> Dealer have to draw to 16/17 is so the dealer can't do deliberately stupid moves to rig the game in their partner's favor.
[2:50:10] <GarbageQueenEllie> These casino folks are so freaking nice. What's the catch?
[2:50:12] <Mr_Strut> Slots tho
[2:50:13] <+cherokee2391> at this rate the only part of your body thats gonna be above the sand is gonna be your head
[2:50:14] <thelonechris> Nyhey there's the high roller
[2:50:14] <%OwlLightningMage> I wonder if Outer Worlds will have casinos

[2:50:28] <Hazard_Kujacker> @SergeEXE yeah. I think clemps at least had a character in Odin, dunno if he started an FC
[2:50:30] <+Strigiform> casinos want to keep you inside after you win until you lose, but if you never lose....
[2:50:30] <Valentinius_Anodyne> You're gonna get ganked if you use that free room
[2:50:31] <%Zaxshimysham> We have no more money, and are in liquidation thanks to you! What a Hero!

[2:51:02] <%Cogito1001> I like how Jack Black is one of the most subbed lp channels and has yet to upload any game play
[2:51:05] <ThePicklesAgain> can you bet on poisonous chihuahuas in this?
[2:51:05] <+SpamKingRathalos> His luck is maxed
[2:51:07] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat have you ran into Raul Tejada, yet?
[2:51:09] <%Skeletorexplains> why don't people just buy more luck if its this easy
[2:51:12] <%Shady_Zaku> His luck is 10 with nightwear
[2:51:12] <takiyami> Lucky Ted defeats Crazy Talk
[2:51:17] <%cureneckbeard> Put luck up to 50
[2:51:22] <Wyrmsblood> Was the DLC for this game any good? I played maybe an hour of Honest Hearts but that's it.
[2:51:23] <%the_mental_punk> What's the name of lucky ted
[2:51:24] <GarbageQueenEllie> @dukenux Makes sense.
[2:51:29] <+Nymphonomicon> I know Pat, but the game only cheats in your favour the higher your Luck is. Otherwise the game is just cheating you.
[2:51:33] <+SpamKingRathalos> Dead Money is good
[2:51:33] <daisymaisy02> :^0
[2:51:35] <%Shady_Zaku> Patron @the_mental_punk
[2:51:40] <%CerberusDriver> the DLC for this game was great, pretty much every DLC was good in some way
[2:51:40] <+Warden_Kain> @Wyrmsblood the dlc was amazing
[2:51:42] <%the_mental_punk> whats the name of lucky ted's stand?
[2:51:43] <%ElenaManetta> Maybe the dealer up'd his luck
[2:51:44] <%PROUD2beGINGER> BLUE MOON
[2:51:45] <+SpamKingRathalos> Honest hearts is goodish
[2:51:47] <Hazard_Kujacker> @SergeEXE I feel ya, it's a bit time consuming, especially nowdays with 2 expansions out and a third releasing this year
[2:51:47] <Mr_Strut> GOTTA CHEAT
[2:51:49] <%lewdskeletor13> @wyrmsblood I’d say all the DLCs were varying levels of good
[2:51:52] <%snow_bush> Counterluck activate!
[2:51:53] <JittersCaffeine> I forget, do these tables have the rule where you win the hand if you take 5 cards without busting?
[2:51:54] <+Warden_Kain> BLUE MOON
[2:51:55] <KeystoneA1> @Wyrmsblood The DLC is good. People have contentious feelings towards Dead Money but the're all alright
[2:51:57] <+SpamKingRathalos> Lonesome road is good

[2:53:26] <ThePicklesAgain> outrun him
[2:53:26] <Hazard_Kujacker> @Wyrmsblood The DLC is pretty good. Dead Money being a little bit contentious because it changes the game to a survival horror escentially. Old World Blues is this game's equivalent to Mothership Zeta from 3 but better and canon. And Lonesome road gave us New Vegas Woolie

[3:08:34] <KeystoneA1> @AngriestPat There's a place called the "Deathclaw Promontory" all the way to the east across the river. It's the only place aside from Gannon you can get Enclave armor
[3:08:35] <alexandrecau> make me a robot

[3:09:07] <usotaku013666> Don't kill the Brotherhood
[3:09:07] <$CrazierCaptDice> 2008 isn't old school
[3:09:08] <%ElenaManetta> I wanted to save Benny cause he had a nice tux
[3:09:14] <jobbedbone> pat likes edging
[3:09:17] <+LinkyBinky> I want another Fallout to take place in west coast
[3:09:18] <%jamiroquais_hat> wait like when?
[3:09:19] <JittersCaffeine> The quest to wear power armor is quite long
[3:09:19] <ASadFrog> Kill the brotherhood
[3:09:19] <usotaku013666> Brotherhood is cool
[3:09:21] <ThePicklesAgain> even the children
[3:09:22] <NarcolepticGoose> his face is all fucked up
[3:09:22] <%jiin6> i never finish the main storyline
[3:09:23] <%ElenaManetta> Benny gets caught by the Legion though, and I'd rather spite the Legion than kill Benny
[3:09:23] <alcors_wisdom> shits fucked my guy

[3:09:39] <fruit_pie_the_magician> I kill Benny and the Legion as soon as humanly possible
[3:09:40] <%ElenaManetta> you're WRONG!!!
[3:09:41] <%TheJungleJoey> elder looks like an alien jesus
[3:09:42] <Ids560> nuking both factions in lonesome road and then killing benny is so stupid
[3:09:44] <%manwithboxonhead> I wonder why...
[3:09:44] <%Laecerelius> You could have friends if you didn't just spend all the time pissing everyone off!
[3:09:44] <dekkitout> fallout 2 shit, actually
[3:09:49] <deadredeyez> 2008 is 11 years ago
[3:09:50] <beatie_g> Kk Yuri
[3:09:51] <$CrazierCaptDice> Hahahha
[3:09:51] <ScreamingMeat> Maybe you have so many enemies because you treat everyone like their fucking idiots
[3:09:52] <$CrazierCaptDice> Hahahah
[3:09:52] <Conky89> I couldn't tell you how many sidequests I did before doing main game quests. I kind of makes sense to do that.
[3:09:55] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> more dead people?
[3:09:56] <%Shady_Zaku> Jesus fucking christ they ACTUALLY PUT BATTLE ROYALE IN REDDEAD LUL LUL
[3:09:58] <yourliteraldog> Lol Vietnam war.
[3:09:59] <%BlackMage66652> @JittersCaffeine Cool kids help Gannon to get it
[3:10:00] <ThePicklesAgain> Dah Bears
[3:10:00] <Gorgen> Im Yuri. You're Yuri. We're all Yuri.
[3:10:01] <Fujiwara_92> I kill Benny early cause of his Gun
[3:10:02] <%sparrrow_> Are the Bears still fucking?
[3:10:02] <jobbedbone> bears OwO
[3:10:03] <$CrazierCaptDice> Fallout 2's literally the best Fallout game
[3:10:04] <%jiin6> @Youwereeatenbyalid Yuri Lowenthal is half the cast in this
[3:10:05] <natebud> Ask them if the bears are still high fiving
[3:10:06] <Kataguro> Da Bear and Da Bull
[3:10:08] <$CrazierCaptDice> hahah
[3:10:11] <PSI_Guy95> Are the bears still winning the superball?
[3:10:16] <%sparrrow_> How bout dem bears?
[3:10:16] <usotaku013666> Kill all the Powder Gangers
[3:10:18] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @Shady_Zaku are you serious?
[3:10:18] <CrabSlacks> "We don't know whats going on so we told the guys who find out to stop it"
[3:10:21] <alcors_wisdom> 2 of those are ultra dead
[3:10:21] <SchroedingersFerret> Liam and Yuri: Two great tastes that taste great together.
[3:10:21] <alrobot2014> @Youwereeatenbyalid Liam O'Brien is the other half
[3:10:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> Da bears
[3:10:23] <%CerberusDriver> LOVE DAH METS
[3:10:23] <$Sphincter_Spelunker> Forlorn Hope PogChamp I love Yu Yu Hakusho
[3:10:23] <yourliteraldog> Wasteland is the best fallout game
[3:10:25] <+SpamKingRathalos> Out of all the quests, this one is the most tedious
[3:10:26] <usotaku013666> Powder gangers suck
[3:10:29] <dekkitout> da beirs
[3:10:30] <Gruhunchously> Already killed all the Powder Gangers
[3:10:31] <GuillotineGorilla> is the bear prepping the bull?
[3:10:31] <%Laecerelius> Pat hasn't killed every powder ganger yet?
[3:10:35] <+InugamiTheHound> the powder gang is in another vault right?
[3:10:36] <%OwlLightningMage> @Sphincter_Spelunker LUL
[3:10:36] <yourliteraldog> Wasteland 2
[3:10:37] <%lewdskeletor13> @shady_zaku Yeah? It’s a popular game mode these days, of course they would. It’s not that big a deal my dude
[3:10:37] <%ElenaManetta> I can't handle these games because I need to finish every side quest before I do main quests. I never beat the main quest of Skyrim.
[3:10:41] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> @alrobot2014 so basically the cast of critical role
[3:10:41] <%Tredecian> sneaky snipe
[3:10:43] <PSI_Guy95> Stealth archer, or stealth anti material rifler
[3:10:44] <%sparrrow_> fetch quest
[3:10:45] <%Shady_Zaku> @youwereeatenbyalid I just found out apatBig LUL LUL LUL
[3:10:47] <beatie_g> Hentai material rifle
[3:10:48] <+Hamshot> did pat just say "hentai material rifle"?
[3:10:49] <natebud> I think paciencia does as much critical damage as the Anti-material Rifle.
[3:10:49] <alcors_wisdom> AT is the biggest damage gun in the game
[3:10:50] <%jiin6> Pain Harder PAT
[3:10:54] <%OwlLightningMage> It's still better than Fallout 4's side quests
[3:10:56] <BakedPretzels> gobi campaign rifle is the best
[3:10:58] <+Nymphonomicon> Why don't you do the Harkin part instead, Pat?
[3:10:59] <+ThirstyMichael> yeah, BoS in New Vegas is kinda weak
[3:11:00] <%Shady_Zaku> Fuck sake I WAS KIDDING ROCKSTAR
[3:11:06] <a_mad_dragon> still bad to use against the deathclaw horde, it shoots & reloads too slow
[3:11:08] <JittersCaffeine> You CAN get it super early
[3:11:09] <%Raxus_Secundus> More explosive
[3:11:14] <ScreamingMeat> AMR has no crit I think
[3:11:15] <dekkitout> gta v online kinda has a br too
[3:11:15] <+Nymphonomicon> Harkin shortens the quest.
[3:11:23] <%Romulus1213> Yes!
[3:11:23] <%BlackMage66652> Did Pat do the DLC already?
[3:11:24] <RedPanda493> AnOtHeR SeTlEmEnt NeDs Your HelP
[3:11:25] <yourliteraldog> Hentai rifle shoos .420 Cal t aheago rounds
[3:11:33] <ThePicklesAgain> now go, let the fetch quest come back to life
[3:11:33] <%Laecerelius> Yeah AMR is not for crits
[3:11:35] <JittersCaffeine> You don’t need Veronica to get into Hidden Valley
[3:11:36] <%bigmacjack12> explosive pat
[3:11:39] <%Raxus_Secundus> @BlackMage66652 no, not yet
[3:11:41] <+SpamKingRathalos> FO3 and FO4 bos certainly had more presence, granted I never finished FO4
[3:11:43] <%WheatlyXT> I don’t think he’s doing any dlc
[3:11:43] <NarcolepticGoose> security guy
[3:11:43] <%Laecerelius> but big upfront damages
[3:11:44] <Gruhunchously> But he also ruins everything, so don't do that.
[3:11:45] <%gus_hornblende> I look away and everything is sepia tone
[3:11:45] <%sparrrow_> but FUCK Harkin he's an asshole
[3:11:47] <ScreamingMeat> But he also makes sure the Brotherhood gets fucked
[3:11:56] <%Romulus1213> 41
[3:11:57] <+Nymphonomicon> @AngriestPat Harkin is the senior Paladin, he wants to replace the Elder.
[3:11:57] <yourliteraldog> Use plasma

[3:27:39] <pswayde> Wonder if theres a Yuri in the vault
[3:27:41] <Ids560> Arcade teaches you how to do power armor if you do his quest
[3:27:42] <dekkitout> which vault is the nuclear hell hole, cause i hope he hits up that one...
[3:27:42] <%claudesavegely> which power armor is the best tho
[3:27:42] <Wyrmsblood> Hmm?
[3:27:42] <LeishmaniaForever> felli8Fatneck
[3:27:42] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> pat your not black please stop
[3:27:45] <%Demirose41> This Quest line is SOooo Long
[3:27:47] <khan99344> Poor Yuri, he honestly only has his one voice. It's too different to really hide it.
[3:27:47] <Jaysky> Did they send out Uncle Ben BibleThump
[3:27:48] <GuillotineGorilla> shouldve done the enclave quests instead
[3:27:48] <%PenmanLupine> You could just steal the manual from the Boomers
[3:27:49] <+Chud_Pudsley> I prefer the Elite LAPD Riot Armor anyway
[3:27:50] <%sparrrow_> It was so cool how you could go back to the Vault in Fallout 3 late game
[3:27:51] <+Ciphris> @AngriestPat maybe if you didn't take 3 hour detours
[3:27:52] <punkthepsychopenguin> seemsgood100 Do you think these people are self aware that they all have the same voice, with the same tone, same accent, and same pace of speaking? Maybe if you make them aware of it the game will collapse on itself.
[3:27:53] <IminyourBase> why do you want power armor? you are already OP
[3:27:55] <MarvMango> What kind of run is this?
[3:27:55] <+faustism> Do you know about the free power armor in the air base?
[3:27:55] <yourliteraldog> They always spoppy
[3:27:57] <+TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat Or just talk to Arcade's people.
[3:27:58] <joedatuous> pat is black on the inside
[3:28:02] <TyrantBelial> it's funny cus the special riot armor from the dlc is better then all the power armor anyways
[3:28:02] <joedatuous> just ask woolie
[3:28:03] <Psychicspacecow> Boone's rifle does like half the damage of an anti-material and has lower dps, but it'll do fine short of deathclaws
[3:28:06] <DonatelloJose> That sentence did not want to come out
[3:28:09] <Veenok> But can you CHEAL it
[3:28:09] <Gruhunchously> This whole quest line is an excuse to make you Go Places
[3:28:10] <%bread_assassin> Enclave Power armor is the best, right? Doing Arcade's quest is probably quicker.
[3:28:12] <%TheSpiritof2277> Arcade's quest is so much easier
[3:28:12] <%CerberusDriver> BOOMERS
[3:28:14] <+Nymphonomicon> Should have talked to Paladin Hardin.
[3:28:14] <TalisKanju> Pat has the blackest insides
[3:28:15] <PSI_Guy95> just play Fallout 4 and get one in like 5 minutes
[3:28:17] <MementoExtasis> i want mah powa ahmor BabyRage WAAA
[3:28:17] <NarcolepticGoose> you can get it from arcande
[3:28:18] <%PenmanLupine> @AngriestPat The Boomers have a manual for Power Armor training. You can steal it.
[3:28:18] <%OwlLightningMage> I didn't know that if that's true LUL
[3:28:19] <chrisboba8> best power armor is enclave armor and tb51 helmet
[3:28:20] <%Th3SmartAlec> nani
[3:28:20] <%Demirose41> DO arcades quest
[3:28:21] <%doc_ock_rokc> @pswayde Don't you know you can only find yuri on ice.
[3:28:21] <Conky89> If Pat goes to that RAD vault after donating all his Radaway
[3:28:23] <yourliteraldog> BOOMERS
[3:28:23] <tootoohi> Lol you're all fucking with him the way you're phrasing this
[3:28:24] <joedatuous> *sip*

[3:28:24] <zafooru> BOMB the BROTHERHOOD
[3:28:25] <%Youwereeatenbyalid> Yeah bread assassin's probably right
[3:28:28] <%sparrrow_> Yeah Pat get Enclave Power Armour instead
[3:28:30] <zafooru> STEAL the TRAINING
[3:28:31] <%SirFailsAlott> pat is black in his heart
[3:28:31] <Gruhunchously> But Arcades' quest doesn't trigger till the end of the main quest.
[3:28:33] <Fujiwara_92> U DON'T NEED BOSS TO USE POWER ARMOR PAT k
[3:28:34] <Veenok> BOOM TIME
[3:28:36] <dekkitout> you promised no more stealing tho
[3:28:42] <JittersCaffeine> You can’t get power armor training from the Enclave until the very end of the gamw
[3:28:42] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can only get arcade's at the end of the game
[3:28:43] <Kataguro> No Steal
[3:28:44] <KeystoneA1> You can only do that at the end of Arcade's quest
[3:28:45] <MementoExtasis> in your ass
[3:28:45] <+faustism> Not the boomers, there is an air field in the south.

[3:37:40] <CastellanVon> The Brotherhood doesn't get along with anybody
[3:37:41] <%ThatRandomGuy661> He's near the entrance ti the building iirc
[3:37:42] <Eirykr> The legion is kinda hard to flesh out considering they're all born slave warriors
[3:37:49] <dekkitout> i forgot about the golf wash outs
[3:37:50] <chrisboba8> because the brotherhood mostly care for technology and themselves
[3:37:51] <alrobot2014> there is a way to get them to get along
[3:37:51] <CrabSlacks> he has a beard i think
[3:37:54] <alexandrecau> the brotherhood doesn'T get along with nobody, they are nuts
[3:37:55] <Conky89> Wanted similar technology and fought over it
[3:37:55] <Rotharn> try ctrl+f
[3:37:55] <$ooblagis> @joedatuous They've talked numerous times about how they had to cut most of the Legion content meant to make them less like an evil army of stormtroopers
[3:37:56] <Gruhunchously> @sparrrow_ They used to get along just fine, but they had a falling out. i can't remember why.
[3:38:00] <%Romulus1213> pat has big gun?
[3:38:00] <KeystoneA1> Front of the airport terminal
[3:38:07] <+SpamKingRathalos> Pat has big gun
[3:38:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @sparrrow_ The brotherhood are xenophobes and the NCR had a skirmish with them for a power plant
[3:38:14] <$CrazierCaptDice> The Brotherhood does get along with people. By not bothering them.
[3:38:15] <punkthepsychopenguin> Pat is a big gun
[3:38:15] <%Romulus1213> Good
[3:38:23] <punkthepsychopenguin> See Pat isn't a human, he's just a gun.
[3:38:23] <NarcolepticGoose> near the main building i think
[3:38:26] <alexandrecau> like the brotherhood always stir shit up in this game and kill doctors for fun
[3:38:27] <$CrazierCaptDice> The NCR fucking annexes the shit out of absolutely everyone near them
[3:38:27] <dekkitout> something something helios one, something something space laser
[3:38:29] <$ooblagis> He's just in one of the tents
[3:38:32] <Kataguro> He should just be over in the tents
[3:38:35] <natebud> just check the tents

[3:43:28] <+SilverFist91> too bad the best dog brain for Rex is the Legion dog brain
[3:43:29] <GarbageQueenEllie> So you guys just keep rapists around, and mention it casually to anyone- what is this, Hollywood?
[3:43:30] <%bread_assassin> You'd want the brain from Old Lady Gibson's dog anyway though, right?
[3:43:31] <Kataguro> Gibson's Dog is best choice. Violet's sucks
[3:43:32] <punkthepsychopenguin> Dhatri's beard looks like it's his skin
[3:43:33] <ArcticAsylum> Different brains have different abilities

[3:44:50] <ArcticAsylum> Mini Nukes only right?
[3:44:52] <%OwlLightningMage> I don't think Pat did the quest where you can convince one of Cook Cook's victims to sick treatment
[3:44:53] <Zalthia> Wait, is Boone his last name?
[3:44:55] <alcors_wisdom> might want to leave companions here

[3:46:30] <KeystoneA1> "If not for the laws of this wasteland I'd have slaughtered you"
[3:46:43] <punkthepsychopenguin> Boone isn't aiming well
[3:46:43] <+PersonaQueen18> He sure is a real...Boone, to combat
[3:46:45] <+SpamKingRathalos> Becomes a saint through murder, k
[3:46:47] <mastersolrac> Boone going up close and personal
[3:46:49] <%PaladinDupre> THIS MACHINE KilLS FIENDS
[3:46:53] <ScreamingMeat> WHY do the Fiends have so much hightech gear!?
[3:46:55] <NarcolepticGoose> ED-E best bot
[3:46:59] <%sparrrow_> car muh
[3:47:00] <Doomstar16> Nice crits!
[3:47:01] <negawrecka> Man I really hate that killing fiends gives karma
[3:47:03] <alexandrecau> blood will atone for theft
[3:47:05] <Gruhunchously> These Fiends will cleanse your Karma good.
[3:47:08] <alcors_wisdom> aye laser rcw
[3:47:09] <CrabSlacks> Murdering people makes me just like jesus!
[3:47:11] <Ran196> they're awful people but i like their outfits
[3:47:13] <PSI_Guy95> Fiends? "I challenge you to a duel!"
[3:47:15] <yourliteraldog> Historical Muhammad is pretty bad ass Historical jesus never bitch smacked a corrupt leader so hard he went to hell
[3:47:20] <%lewdskeletor13> @negawrecka Why? They’re rapists
[3:47:25] <alrobot2014> i thought they were from vault 3?
[3:47:32] <Big_King_Coconut> Boone just killed three Fiends with one bullet
[3:47:33] <Kataguro> Look at all that red
[3:47:33] <%sparrrow_> I wonder if they'd ever make a Fallout game set in a different country
[3:47:34] <zeroraider> Just nuke them, like Ghandi wanted!
[3:47:36] <+SpamKingRathalos> Fiends are the most diverse enemy of the lot, one could be fucking you in the ass with a baseball bat while another could be fielding a plasma rifle.
[3:47:36] <yourliteraldog> Also murder
[3:47:36] <%nelsonq415> good evening pat!
[3:47:40] <%sparrrow_> HIGH TECH
[3:47:41] <%ThePuddingDead> I respecc that
[3:47:42] <alcors_wisdom> its also because pat is coming in at kind of a high level so theyre scaled up slightly
[3:47:44] <thelonechris> Was Vault 3 like the high-tech weapons vault?
[3:47:44] <harrydeans_hawaiian_shirt> @angriestpat do you always play NV as a military sniper man?
[3:47:44] <punkthepsychopenguin> @zeroraider Ghandi, the big nuke boi.

[3:47:49] <Zebroneath> He was the new guy.
[3:47:51] <Kataguro> ONLY Evil now
[3:47:51] <punkthepsychopenguin> I mean a pool cue would mess you up.
[3:47:55] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat you can repair thermic lances with pool cues
[3:47:59] <negawrecka> cause I hate that killing any enemy that targets you giving karma good or bad
[3:48:05] <$ooblagis> You need to kill more drug addicts to become a good person
[3:48:07] <%OwlLightningMage> Pool cue beats gun if you're fucked up enough
[3:48:10] <negawrecka> without you drawing aggro
[3:48:15] <yourliteraldog> Aleast The legion are sober when they rape

[3:49:21] <zeroraider> Because war never changes
[3:49:23] <Doomstar16> That's a great shot.
[3:49:23] <Etherealizer> @Gruhunchously EVE mod improves critical deaths

[4:03:45] <%rdark_ksu> a golf club is honestly a very ineffective weapon

[4:04:10] <+SpamKingRathalos> Unless they got the Ranger armor, your squad ain't shit Gorobet.
[4:04:10] <$Piemono> Imagine being an elite group of soldiers and watching your team getting killed by some dude with a golf club

[4:05:45] <punkthepsychopenguin> @Gruhunchously they could add some flair.
[4:05:45] <CrabSlacks> get them acrobatics up
[4:05:52] <alcors_wisdom> @Yuroshi he did that yestarday
[4:05:56] <KeystoneA1> @Yuroshi He did a stream of it
[4:05:56] <Angry_Ev1L> who doesn't
[4:05:59] <natebud> I fixed a memory leak by walking backwards in Fallout 3. So crazy it just might work.
[4:06:03] <+SpamKingRathalos> Driver Nephi is a fucking demi-human, blessed by Khorne.
[4:06:06] <punkthepsychopenguin> Why is Boon's face so pale.
[4:06:14] <Kataguro> Tell them to wait
[4:06:19] <punkthepsychopenguin> Compared to his arms.
[4:06:19] <Yuroshi> yesterday he asked for the unlocker when it came out
[4:06:22] <%joylent_blue> Boone is clingy ok
[4:06:25] <+timblenaut> @punkthepsychopenguin pat installed whiteface mod

[4:06:34] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat got a white face mod
[4:06:36] <Saiyza> So Pat, do you prefer punchgirl Veronica or Big Gun Boon?
[4:06:39] <NarcolepticGoose> unlike pat, boone can aim
[4:06:53] <Gruhunchously> Always a good day when something blows up.
[4:06:56] <%jamiroquais_hat> thats a real slow explosion
[4:07:01] <CrabSlacks> That car got mad, man
[4:07:11] <KeystoneA1> EVE mod makes the explosions last longer and look prettier
[4:07:14] <alcors_wisdom> hey pat unless youre the one who kills them you dont get karma for killing them
[4:07:14] <%SirFailsAlott> to be fair pat is using a controller
[4:07:18] <BakedPretzels> talk to the goron
[4:07:19] <Gruhunchously> Slow Rythmic Pounding
[4:07:20] <ScreamingMeat> Audio freaking its shit
[4:07:31] <%OwlLightningMage> Ghosts WutFace
[4:07:31] <yourliteraldog> Man fallout 76 has gotten beter
[4:07:32] <punkthepsychopenguin> I can't believe a whiteface mod exists.
[4:07:36] <Jaysky> Don't make fun of the explosions jamiroquais_hat it's trying it's best
[4:07:39] <zeroraider> WHOS shooting
[4:07:40] <%easternstealth> You're having war flashbacks
[4:07:41] <Zalthia> Pat should just go into the Fiend’s vault and wipe them out. It would solve his Karma problem
[4:07:41] <Ran196> everybody is dead :(
[4:07:43] <%ghostsofcarcosa> ghost lasers
[4:07:44] <babo____> Boone is by far the best companion in this game imo
[4:07:45] <%hatesdps> that was the sound of cook cooks ghost getting some
[4:07:45] <ArcticAsylum> BANG BANG BANG
[4:07:45] <%spacekataz18> Who shot that?!
[4:07:46] <%rakshum> spooky noises
[4:07:47] <%ThePuddingDead> oh u know
[4:07:50] <llpanic> Those shootouts in the New Vegas outskirts always made me nervous. Are those just the sounds?
[4:07:59] <alwayspronking> who's shooting!?
[4:08:00] <Gruhunchously> Somebody got wasted
[4:08:02] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Who's shooting?
[4:08:03] <%joylent_blue> EVERYONE is dead
[4:08:04] <dekkitout> pretty sure there was an off camera stand battle
[4:08:05] <zeroraider> all that missed karma
[4:08:06] <alexandrecau> got busy
[4:08:12] <%TheUberknife> GLAK GLAK TriHard
[4:08:12] <KeystoneA1> Always love hearing the NCR vs Fiend shootouts
[4:08:16] <punkthepsychopenguin> Guys the new vegas boogeyman is shooting.

[4:08:26] <Gruhunchously> Rip and Tear
[4:08:29] <BeefyQueefer> ass tearing
[4:08:30] <FracturedImage> there goes all your karma
[4:08:30] <PinionRobot> One of them was dabbing
[4:08:36] <+InugamiTheHound> why can't the NCR just do that more often kill off the powder gang and fiends
[4:08:37] <%TheSpiritof2277> tearing and eating maximum ass
[4:08:40] <%OwlLightningMage> Its the More Mysterious Stranger WutFace
[4:08:46] <%jamiroquais_hat> always played this music when I was closing down the university library for the night
[4:08:49] <%ThePuddingDead> when u unholster your weapon so fast the sound needs a sec to catch up
[4:08:51] <+Superkbrown95> cant believe you need psplus to play the doa 6 beta :p
[4:08:56] <Gruhunchously> One was dabbing and another was T-Posing
[4:09:00] <%joylent_blue> you can tell him to shoot harder :)
[4:09:01] <yourliteraldog> NO BOON ONLY KILL
[4:09:01] <Kataguro> Just make him wait
[4:09:12] <%The_Lady_Alustriel> Be aggressive! B E aggressive!
[4:09:13] <Gruhunchously> No Boone, we must kill.
[4:09:19] <CrabSlacks> Boone is an angry, angry man
[4:09:20] <ArcticAsylum> @inugamithehound Cause politics and chain of command/ orders
[4:09:27] <+SpamKingRathalos> All you need is kill
[4:09:30] <ArcticAsylum> Also the NCR sucks
[4:09:30] <natebud> Driver has a gold club
[4:09:31] <%joylent_blue> Nephi is usually on the 2nd floor
[4:09:38] <llpanic> Boon is Jerard Butler from that one movie where he's avenging his family.
[4:09:41] <+SpamKingRathalos> Nephi knows about snipers
[4:09:52] <+ironshah> boone smash SMOrc
[4:09:52] <%lewdskeletor13> BOONE
[4:10:05] <+SimplyPandaz> Pat you are never gonna be good
[4:10:13] <dekkitout> dont worry, you still have all of vaults 3 and 11
[4:10:16] <%CurrySauseBandit> inb4 NCR patrol already found Nephi
[4:10:16] <zeroraider> need to kill moar for peace Pat
[4:10:16] <Kataguro> Boone is totally going to kill Driver
[4:10:17] <Gruhunchously> TFW You'll never as good a shot as Boone.
[4:10:17] <alcors_wisdom> next time youre down south in the states remind me to take you to a range pat
[4:10:25] <zafooru> hey pat, when are you going to pick up Lily
[4:10:27] <EMFole> @AngriestPat i love you weird internet dad
[4:10:28] <+pl0xzz> @AngriestPat Never gonna be able to wash that stench off
[4:10:34] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is still evil LUL
[4:10:34] <%crusaderthree7gamer> yo
[4:10:36] <CastellanVon> If Boone hadn't retired, the NCR wouldn't have started losing to the Legion
[4:10:40] <llpanic> They're camping inside I think.
[4:10:43] <%AncelDeLambert> dangit, did Pat not go with the NCR troops for this?
[4:10:45] <deviljhojho94> what an evil hero
[4:10:54] <Saiyza> I can imagine Boone running over to Driver with a Javelin and acing him in the face.
[4:10:59] <%Mornaka> @AncelDeLambert he did
[4:11:07] <%AncelDeLambert> they're all in there sharpenin' their KNIVES
[4:11:10] <natebud> Does the ratslayer have better zoom?
[4:11:19] <%joylent_blue> Boone has NO chill
[4:11:22] <CastellanVon> That was a Boone Tier shot.
[4:11:25] <punkthepsychopenguin> Pat just do what the hero of kvatch does in knights of the nine.
[4:11:26] <%crusaderthree7gamer> How's everyone doing?
[4:11:26] <%joylent_blue> Boone is anti chill
[4:11:33] <slothslayer828> youre mine
[4:11:37] <%AncelDeLambert> Driver will come running like a spaz, that's how you spot him
[4:11:38] <%TheUberknife> Day of Defeat experience is showing
[4:11:41] <daisymaisy02> What's your karma at now?
[4:11:42] <ScreamingMeat> Karma go up
[4:11:43] <cogsprockets> Jeez, what crimes happened here, getting to Evil in New Vegas never happens

[4:15:17] <TheAspiringWriter> I killed Driver Nelphi without ever knowing he was a quest character. So when I ripped his head off I carried it for days not knowing what the fuck to do with it.

[4:27:12] <khan99344> Would it still be carbonated all these years later ?
[4:27:15] <daisymaisy02> @ThePuddingDead I mean................ its sarsaparilla............
[4:27:19] <SirBrawler18> I keep hearing bad things about Fallout 4. Is it not worth it for a franchise newbie?
[4:27:20] <khan99344> That shit goes bad eventually right ?
[4:27:20] <%lewdskeletor13> Pat LOVES whiteface
[4:27:22] <%Darsis> Is this Vanilla or modded?
[4:27:24] <joedatuous> no

[4:27:41] <Kataguro> Fuckin
[4:27:41] <Gruhunchously> Yeah, Pat kind of broke the game at this point.
[4:27:41] <deviljhojho94> RUDE D:
[4:27:43] <joedatuous> she should wash her face
[4:27:43] <Ran196> shoot her in the face
[4:27:44] <%OwlLightningMage> @SirBrawler18 It's a good game but bad Fallout RPG
[4:27:45] <DSD24> Stop fucking swearing
[4:27:47] <%AncelDeLambert> Well fucking shit, give me some fucking slack
[4:27:48] <ArcticAsylum> @sirbrawler18 4 is a good game, just not a good Fallout Game
[4:27:48] <AlasterAngelo> fuck fuck fuck

[4:27:52] <%Laecerelius> Now murder them all after talking your way into the place!
[4:27:53] <Falketh> @SirBrawler18 Its an okay game but a bad fallout game. I wouldnt recomend it unless you find it on sale.
[4:27:54] <%lewdskeletor13> LANGUAGE
[4:27:55] <deviljhojho94> Yeah... Kahn totally Keepo
[4:27:56] <Teh_Un> Infiltration complete
[4:27:56] <FracturedImage> shoulda done this with the khan mission
[4:27:56] <dekkitout> "Well why didnt you say you were handing out drugs? You seem cool, GET IN!"
[4:27:58] <ScreamingMeat> Fucking fuck fucker, fuckity fuck fucker fucker fuck
[4:27:58] <+Plankman> more like a CON
[4:27:59] <babo____> @sirbrawler18 It’s not as good as 3 or NV but it’s also not as bad as the Internet makes it out to be imo.
[4:28:00] <zeroraider> a big con
[4:28:00] <%PaladinDupre> A CON
[4:28:00] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Zalthia has the best combat but otherwise it is a sub-par fallout game
[4:28:00] <%jamiroquais_hat> so polite
[4:28:00] <CalderGaming> Boone performs the universal single teabag greeting
[4:28:02] <+cerberuscarmine> CON
[4:28:03] <Sinister_Aglet> Hello.
[4:28:03] <zafooru> "hllo"
[4:28:03] <+MechaBaphomet> hello
[4:28:05] <Kataguro> There's the fake wall
[4:28:06] <%LlwynogMewnLliw> ONLY shoot at him
[4:28:06] <$ooblagis> That poor, normal man
[4:28:07] <%joylent_blue> that guy seemed nice
[4:28:07] <alcors_wisdom> khan-artist
[4:28:08] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> What a polite Fiend
[4:28:08] <%Cavumentum> "Hello."
[4:28:08] <Zalthia> It’s not a good fallout game, and it’s only an okay shooter and a bad rpg
[4:28:08] <NarcolepticGoose> why is that check 64?
[4:28:09] <$KnivesEve> hiya
[4:28:09] <Gruhunchously> KHAAN
[4:28:10] <AlasterAngelo> Hi there
[4:28:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> he's a con alright sugoiSmugsnake
[4:28:11] <%ThePuddingDead> Hello.
[4:28:11] <llpanic> "hello" What a polite murderous fella
[4:28:13] <+Chud_Pudsley> I usually walk in and start delivering my six shooter's justice.
[4:28:18] <%lewdskeletor13> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[4:28:19] <%bread_assassin> Did that have a Speech requirement of 64? That's oddly specific.
[4:28:21] <%yoshkosh20> its the bald head and sickly complexion that sells it
[4:28:21] <%jiin6> pat's a KAAAAHNN
[4:28:24] <Kataguro> That's us, and we RULE
[4:28:25] <AlasterAngelo> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[4:28:25] <%SirFailsAlott> how many yuri's here chat?
[4:28:27] <%Laecerelius> What a polite murderous rape monster!
[4:28:30] <joedatuous> what a soothing voice
[4:28:31] <%Darsis> You should at least need a hat or jacket for people to think you are a khan...
[4:28:31] <natebud> @SirBrawler18 you play fallout 4 waiting for something cool to happen. Then you're 200 hours in and still nothing happens
[4:28:33] <DSD24> Ranger Suquioa is the best revolver in this game
[4:28:41] <Gruhunchously> Fiends are weird like that. They have very specific demands
[4:28:45] <ArcticAsylum> LUL
[4:28:47] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:28:50] <AlasterAngelo> Lucky is my favorite revolver
[4:28:50] <+cerberuscarmine> XD
[4:28:51] <dekkitout> yuri count: 437
[4:28:51] <PSI_Guy95> That's more like it
[4:28:52] <%jiin6> Yuri HAS NO CHILL
[4:28:54] <Doomstar16> What a rude prick.
[4:28:57] <Kataguro> I'm surprised Boone isn't shooting everyone
[4:29:01] <%lewdskeletor13> Spider Man wtf
[4:29:03] <%rdark_ksu> thievery!
[4:29:03] <ScreamingMeat> Fallout 4 is only good with Mods
[4:29:03] <DSD24> Can you imagine Spiderman saying that to someone?
[4:29:06] <%sparrrow_> The Yuri Everywhere System has reached CRITICAL MASS
[4:29:09] <RevenTheLight> Oh Yuri, you caaaard
[4:29:10] <Gruhunchously> Boone only shoots the Legion on sight.
[4:29:11] <%TheSpiritof2277> Yuri count: OOPS all Yuri
[4:29:11] <ArcticAsylum> Wonder what it smells like in here
[4:29:16] <%Sphincter_Spelunker> Was that shit on the floor
[4:29:16] <%OwlLightningMage> @natebud This is the best way I've heard 4 described LUL
[4:29:19] <$ooblagis> They aren't exactly super skilled
[4:29:19] <+Plankman> maybe they locked it up themselves
[4:29:21] <khan99344> The Apocolypse really fucked Spider-Man up
[4:29:25] <st_jimmy456> in a vault full of drug addicts yeah
[4:29:26] <DSD24> Maybe all the Fiends can't pick locks
[4:29:27] <PSI_Guy95> That's someones stash, maybe
[4:29:29] <yourliteraldog> they all kill\
[4:29:32] <suikudo> So high they cant pick locks
[4:29:34] <%lewdskeletor13> BAD SHIT
[4:29:35] <%jiin6> the Mojave makes you wish for a Nuclear Yuri
[4:29:36] <CrabSlacks> she needs a cool down tent
[4:29:38] <llpanic> You're not gonna feel anything in a little bit darling, don't worry,
[4:29:39] <Gruhunchously> On that note, there's a easy locked door in this vault with dozens of bobby pins in front of it. It's hilarious.
[4:29:40] <alcors_wisdom> @khan99344 those radioactive spider
[4:29:40] <PSI_Guy95> Gimme your sweet roll
[4:29:44] <%joylent_blue> i always get lost in vaults
[4:29:44] <linklol321> I remember the first time i did vault 3, killed everyone with nephi's golf club
[4:29:47] <mayorrev> i dont want to set the worrrrlllld onnnn fireeee
[4:29:54] <DSD24> @Gruhunchously That just proves my theory that's awesome!
[4:29:57] <dekkitout> funnily enough, theres an alternate civil war timeline where spider-man becomes immortan joe
[4:30:02] <%SmolBluGhost> Howdy all apatWink
[4:30:07] <%ThePuddingDead> what up
[4:30:09] <mercado94> thats rad
[4:30:09] <DSD24> @SmolBluGhost Hiya!
[4:30:10] <Kataguro> Big Howdy
[4:30:12] <%Stevennapalm> Is fallout 3 better than 4?
[4:30:14] <%SiameseSneeze> This would be a great stash... on survival...
[4:30:15] <CrabSlacks> you should eat all that food
[4:30:16] <yourliteraldog> Yay radoACTIVE YURI
[4:30:19] <%IDTheftVictim> Thos os like watching a thriller from the eyes of the serial killer.
[4:30:21] <%lewdskeletor13> @smolblughost Howdy fella apatDab
[4:30:21] <khan99344> I mean Last Stand Spidey is basically the Punisher.
[4:30:21] <Teh_Un> Steal their coffee cups Pat, they'll never see it coming
[4:30:24] <%joylent_blue> they're too high to care
[4:30:25] <%OwlLightningMage> Fallout 3 is a better RPG than 4
[4:30:29] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Stevennapalm no
[4:30:32] <joedatuous> he killed furiosa with his radioactive jizz
[4:30:33] <PSI_Guy95> You say you're delivering but you are actually stealing! CLEVER PAT
[4:30:34] <$ooblagis> Wrong Vault
[4:30:34] <%IDTheftVictim> Don't turn your back to that man Fiend girl!
[4:30:35] <Falketh> Fallout 3 is way better than 4 and I dont even like fallout 3
[4:30:35] <alrobot2014> yes
[4:30:36] <%sparrrow_> why aren't they hostile?
[4:30:37] <a_useless_lamp> FO3 better than 4
[4:30:37] <KeystoneA1> Yes
[4:30:38] <CalderGaming> standing.... on the edge... of the yuri...
[4:30:40] <$ooblagis> Most Vaults have that though
[4:30:42] <Doomstar16> You need to open it from the other side.
[4:30:43] <Darren716> Other side
[4:30:43] <KeystoneA1> You have to get at it from another direction
[4:30:43] <drewslo> 3>4
[4:30:44] <thelonechris> I like how those high-tech doors still use traditional locks
[4:30:45] <DSD24> @OwlLightningMage That sentence is awful
[4:30:47] <ScreamingMeat> I can't wait for Fallout 4: New Vagas. All of the greatness of New Vagas with FO4 incredible crafting system and gunplay
[4:30:50] <%jiin6> Steal there food, like what paige does to you Pat
[4:30:56] <llpanic> For those who don't know this vault is filled with murderous junkies because their original denizens opened the vault to them thinking they were not murderous junkies.
[4:31:01] <SirBrawler18> So anyone else try the DOA 6 beta yet? Im having fun, but none of my favorite characters (Hitomi, Leifang) Are available.
[4:31:07] <DSD24> @OwlLightningMage The Idea that the 3RD game is a better RPG than the 4TH that's so bad
[4:31:08] <%SmolBluGhost> apatWink apatWink This game, i appreciate LUL
[4:31:09] <khan99344> The Punisher would love the Apocalypse come to think of it
[4:31:11] <%SirFailsAlott> @ScreamingMeat wasn't that project cancelled?
[4:31:15] <Xelhesia> all this Yuri talk makes me want pat to play Tales of Vesperia. The Tales games deserve alot more love and attention honestly
[4:31:17] <%CaptainPileDriver> how are you still up
[4:31:18] <khan99344> Like this is Pun-Pun's wet dream.
[4:31:25] <%goose_attack_almanac> Murder Karma GO UP!
[4:31:27] <%SiameseSneeze> Kill them all!!! on the way out :)
[4:31:30] <DSD24> @SirBrawler18 I like Diego so far! wish I could see a movelist though
[4:31:30] <Gruhunchously> They're just walking Karma machines
[4:31:31] <dekkitout> there is also a handfull of punisher in the apocalypse stories
[4:31:32] <PSI_Guy95> Worst deliveryman ever
[4:31:32] <%lewdskeletor13> MURDER
[4:31:34] <$ooblagis> @SirFailsAlott No, they had to move to rerecording all the VA

[4:31:43] <%ThatGuyfromMars> TUNNEL SNAKES RULE
[4:31:44] <yourliteraldog> Yall remember that that time spider-man killed MJ with his radioactive cum
[4:31:44] <laurenwolfe> There's a comic about The Punisher in the apocalypse. He travels across a radiactive wasteland and gets poisoning, just so he can kill a bunch of rich midgets with big heads in their vault.
[4:31:45] <Fujiwara_92> just imagine punisher there hm LUL
[4:31:46] <mercado94> BILLY
[4:31:47] <drewslo> best thing about fallout 4 is the gunplay but it still sucks compared to most triple A games
[4:31:50] <%SiameseSneeze> Billy is a little bitch, and so is his brother
[4:31:50] <KeystoneA1> Good job Mint
[4:31:50] <%Everpresent_Overseer> Way to go Billy
[4:31:51] <alcors_wisdom> killroy was here

[4:31:54] <CrabSlacks> It was Billy :I
[4:31:54] <ScreamingMeat> @SirFailsAlott No that was Fallout 3 in Fallout 4, which I heard they recently started up again
[4:31:55] <%ThePuddingDead> yeah?
[4:31:55] <%jiin6> @llpanic the cons of a sheltered life
[4:31:57] <Doomstar16> The bloodbath is about to begin.

[4:33:34] <%Big_Dream> pat dont mod your game Bethesda will make you do home work
[4:33:34] <%joylent_blue> oh ok
[4:33:34] <mercado94> then create the mod!
[4:33:36] <%LouieRouie> Karma Chameleon
[4:33:39] <ScreamingMeat> Make them wait outside
[4:33:40] <EMFole> big cheats caught on stream (gone sexual)
[4:33:40] <mcarora19> Real life karma go dow
[4:33:41] <alcors_wisdom> yeah that would be obsene to program
[4:33:42] <yourliteraldog> console command
[4:33:42] <%SmolBluGhost> Wild man
[4:33:44] <%thegoldenattack> cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100
[4:33:45] <DSD24> I love this title screen
[4:33:45] <%AncelDeLambert> LUL Pat trying to cheat so he can steal more
[4:33:46] <applesonthemoon> oh thats an understandable mod
[4:33:47] <+TheMattman1313> @AngriestPat you check Karma directly from console commands if you want to know th eactual value
[4:33:47] <%crimsonharvest> I see your big cheats pat
[4:33:50] <yourliteraldog> how much did you steal
[4:33:50] <AlasterAngelo> BOONE DON'T SHOOT
[4:33:50] <drewslo> just give the followers medical supplies
[4:33:51] <%Solidus_113> @AngriestPat remember to reset archive invalidation so your texture mods work
[4:33:51] <Ran196> There's mods that wil allow you to free slaves
[4:33:51] <Idon__> just use console commands or whatever
[4:33:52] <rob_pat> live with your atrocities
[4:33:57] <PSI_Guy95> You gotta gain your own karma
[4:33:58] <llpanic> You gotta FEEL THE KILL to get the karma, Pat.
[4:34:00] <+Nymphonomicon> @AngriestPat There is a mod that changes the Karma check for Cass leaving you.
[4:34:01] <alcors_wisdom> like what a headache that would be to program companions to give you karma
[4:34:03] <%pectusumbra> alright, time to get some sleep, will catch the rest of this some time tomorrow. Good night!
[4:34:04] <yourliteraldog> Game run by woolie
[4:34:04] <%LouieRouie> He stole a lot
[4:34:06] <PSI_Guy95> Gotta follow the dharma dude
[4:34:20] <zafooru> the only Hepa you will find here is Hepatitis
[4:34:20] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat stole lots o pies and made lots of lies
[4:34:23] <alrobot2014> the filters are next to motor runner or at least in the same area @AngriestPat
[4:34:32] <natebud> player(dot)rewardKarma <amount>
[4:34:34] <CrabSlacks> If anyone in here was good Karma wouldn't allow you to kill them
[4:34:41] <Futurecity10> lockpick broke, reload save
[4:34:43] <%lewdskeletor13> damn I think I got some bad shit
[4:34:49] <khan99344> This was Pat's Mistake, he played this like it was a Woolie simulator.
[4:34:53] <drewslo> still dont know how your karma got that low without killing anyone good
[4:34:58] <yourliteraldog> When I was a kid I broke A lock trying to pick it like in fallout
[4:35:08] <yourliteraldog> My mom was mad
[4:35:16] <%lewdskeletor13> IMMA COMPUTAH
[4:35:19] <khan99344> Did you learn how to pick locks ?
[4:35:20] <AlasterAngelo> @yourliteraldog obviously your lockpick skill wasn't high enough
[4:35:20] <Ran196> its a good source of fire
[4:35:21] <%joylent_blue> its like toilet paper
[4:35:21] <%ahegotrigger> that is the risk
[4:35:21] <CrabSlacks> toilet paper
[4:35:21] <%NumbusPlays> It's mostly paper, which is rare
[4:35:23] <KeystoneA1> It's cloth
[4:35:23] <somnolic> its used as shitpaper
[4:35:23] <%Laecerelius> Toilet paper, i guess
[4:35:23] <%OwlLightningMage> @yourliteraldog LUL
[4:35:24] <yourliteraldog> she hit me with a nelt
[4:35:25] <+Fenlig> Toilet paper would be a premium
[4:35:25] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat collectors item?
[4:35:26] <zafooru> tinder
[4:35:30] <st_jimmy456> you can sell confederate money for like $2 a pop
[4:35:30] <SirBrawler18> One thing about the RE 2 remake i'm wondering about is who finishes off who at the end? In my head Claire vs Birkin, Leon vs Mr. X makes more sense
[4:35:30] <yourliteraldog> Abelt
[4:35:31] <llpanic> If you want Karma badly do the Ghoul questline.
[4:35:32] <%Agami23> historians probably collect it
[4:35:33] <%jamiroquais_hat> if the casinos take it works
[4:35:33] <lupusinfabula_> it is a literal wad of bills for only 10 caps
[4:35:35] <%luftraumm1> cotton
[4:35:35] <+mayiplay> it's cause of your garbage Barter
[4:35:36] <drewslo> dont you want to sleep on a bed made of money
[4:35:38] <Pistachius> i just use pre-war money for chips at the casinos
[4:35:40] <AlasterAngelo> Yeah they use it to power their Tinder apps
[4:35:40] <yourliteraldog> It was not fun
[4:35:41] <zeroraider> any paper is probably useful
[4:35:47] <%IDTheftVictim> Like it makes as much sense as caps
[4:35:47] <dekkitout> the ncr probably reprints it
[4:35:50] <Ran196> thats how the mafia works
[4:35:51] <HumanGiant13> Pre war money would probably be decent toilet paper
[4:35:56] <+Fenlig> no one wants a stinky hand
[4:36:01] <+starkandstag> take that capitalism
[4:36:05] <somnolic> no the CAPS are toiletpaper
[4:36:06] <Pistachius> silky toilet paper
[4:36:07] <thelonechris> Better than using dry, scorched leaves
[4:36:09] <%IDTheftVictim> CAP-italist?!
[4:36:10] <khan99344> When does the murder start ?
[4:36:11] <%sparrrow_> Claire A, Leon B is canon
[4:36:12] <madpuppy2424> Are you gonna get the gold pip boy?
[4:36:18] <natebud> ace of spades
[4:36:20] <+nottaalotta> I AM THE GAME
[4:36:22] <Weeabooninja> It would make for good TP if it wasn't for how filthy Cash money is
[4:36:23] <$ooblagis> Pat really needs to fix the whiteface
[4:36:25] <CalderGaming> IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GAME
[4:36:25] <KeystoneA1> Wanna know if someone's post-apocalyptic preparations are legit? If they stock up on TP and tampons then they know what's up.
[4:36:27] <%lewdskeletor13> Does REmake have two different campaigns for Claire and Leon?
[4:36:29] <%SmolBluGhost> Motorhead is the shit u mean
[4:36:33] <$ooblagis> More WHITEFACE
[4:36:35] <natebud> Look at those TANLINES
[4:36:44] <%jamiroquais_hat> what a line read
[4:36:47] <%rdark_ksu> he seems way to normal
[4:36:48] <rob_pat> he doesnt look as reasonable as he sounds
[4:36:48] <llpanic> Chill dude
[4:36:49] <khan99344> This guy sounds very reasonable for a Fiend.
[4:36:49] <AlasterAngelo> boy he doesn't look good
[4:36:51] <yourliteraldog> Dang
[4:36:52] <Idon__> wow, he's noncholant

[4:36:59] <CrabSlacks> like the opening of fallout 2 :(
[4:36:59] <dekkitout> didnt know runner was apart of sense of whiteface...
[4:37:08] <drewslo> the most civil fiend in the game
[4:37:18] <+cerberuscarmine> wasnt it full of religious people who were non violent?
[4:37:18] <%lewdskeletor13> He’s high as a kite
[4:37:21] <AlasterAngelo> Oh I know Mean Son of a Bitch
[4:37:26] <%SiameseSneeze> Bad Motherfucker is the best Mod Companion, fight me
[4:37:27] <SirBrawler18> Wait thats his name? LUL

[4:43:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 43m.
[4:43:36] <%bevyrage> talking about the papers on the floor that sorta look like debris spray?
[4:43:56] <%joylent_blue> was there literally one word in that hacking screen
[4:44:03] <dekkitout> its a mod
[4:44:07] <%joylent_blue> oh ok
[4:44:08] <%OwlLightningMage> Pat is cheating
[4:44:11] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[4:44:16] <%Kahnicus> welp this'll have to be caught on the youtube archive, night
[4:44:18] <+MechaBaphomet> Big cheats for little boys
[4:44:22] <%jiin6> Cheatering pat?
[4:44:24] <%luftraumm1> the room you commented on them not being smart enough to open
[4:44:27] <dekkitout> almost everyone mods that in tho
[4:44:30] <adamisfruit> He struggles with a very easy mini game
[4:44:38] <natebud> @AngriestPat book in that room you unlocked earlier. It's red
[4:44:39] <%OwlLightningMage> The hacking sucks LUL
[4:44:43] <%joylent_blue> i like the hacking minigame FeelsBadMan
[4:44:49] <rob_pat> to be fair doing it over and over can get taxing
[4:44:50] <deity_majora> no climbing allowed
[4:44:54] <+case01> Is pat playing the fallout 2 ost?
[4:44:59] <$ooblagis> The book in that bedroom you unlocked
[4:45:04] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm glad Outer Worlds won't have a hacking mini game
[4:45:05] <$ooblagis> As soon as you entered this wing
[4:45:13] <DSD24> @case01 That OST is in Fallout New Vegas
[4:45:14] <AlasterAngelo> I would feel bad about killing the polite fiends
[4:45:17] <%joylent_blue> new vegas has fallout 2 tracks in its OST by default
[4:45:23] <%jiin6> Stealth book, in RED

[4:45:49] <Ran196> Primm Slimm is best cop
[4:45:51] <%SirFailsAlott> @joylent_blue NV has the best non-radio soundtrack in the series imo
[4:45:51] <DSD24> @AlasterAngelo I wouldn't just cause they are polite doesn't mean they won't kill more people while being polite
[4:45:54] <llpanic> Is Primm Slimm the sheriff?
[4:45:57] <dekkitout> in order to beat the commies, you must think like a commie
[4:46:09] <%joylent_blue> SirFailsAlott hard agree
[4:46:13] <Kataguro> Yeah, robo sheriff
[4:46:15] <AlasterAngelo> @DSD24 just cuz I feel bad doesn't mean I still wouldn't do it though
[4:46:18] <st_jimmy456> LOOPER
[4:46:18] <llpanic> nice
[4:46:19] <PSI_Guy95> @dekkitout If you think like a commie then you ARE a commie, get outta here commie
[4:46:24] <CrabSlacks> When you have 100 science there's only one choice after you pick all the () <> stuff that removes options
[4:46:24] <%joylent_blue> D:
[4:46:30] <%PaladinDupre> Primm Slimm dont take shit
[4:46:33] <natebud> I've never heard any of this Fiend dialogue, usually just kill em on sight

[4:46:45] <captainthunderwolf> You'd almost think they were all drug-addicted murder-rapists.

[4:46:55] <+Raidou24> Nappy time with edgy?
