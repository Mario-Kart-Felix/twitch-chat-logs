[0:03:56] <%DovaDude29> Is omori a short style of indie game, or is going the full mile / a fully fleshed out rpg  of sorts?
[0:04:12] <SatChamp> i tried so hard to get thru the game but i got so bored

[0:04:26] <%RealThiele> oh no theres only 183 people LUL
[0:04:27] <hereiam407> Looks kind of full featured, it says its around 20hours long
[0:04:28] <+LuckyHitman> @DovaDude29 its like 20 hours, more complex than undertale, less complex than earthbound
[0:04:30] <+Skuullty> takes abt 12-16hours to complete
[0:04:33] <hereiam407> At least
[0:04:35] <+Liquid_Dio> @DovaDude29 It's long-ish (~20 hrs) but not as long as most bigger RPGs
[0:04:37] <goldenchaos96> what is the deal with Omori?
[0:04:41] <mar_krow> Oh boy Omari
[0:04:42] <MrPandastic> Omori's got some meat in there.
[0:04:46] <crudjandall> hello scrubs!
[0:04:52] <%Deano8817> @goldenchaos96 Depression
[0:04:53] <marvel877> i backed this game and still haven't played it. the long bouts of radio silence from the developer coupled with any activity from them just for their merch store really put me off on it.
[0:04:58] <%StephanieSadGirl> Less then 200 people, then we better talk about mpreg enough for five times that amoutn of people
[0:04:58] <%RealThiele> Omori got some italian meat int here, since its a pizza game
[0:05:01] <%emperordread> I honestly read the stream title as Orbmi
[0:05:02] <%baka_sugoi> UmU everbody
[0:05:14] <%RealThiele> mpregs back on the menu boys
[0:05:16] <ataxia72> v excited for this, hope pat likes it

[0:05:24] <%atlasdotwav> HYPE THANKS @full_circle <3 u @patstaresat
[0:05:33] <goldenchaos96> @goldenchaos96 oh boy this gonna be fun
[0:05:39] <MrPandastic> This game definitely has its flaws but I had a good time playing this.
[0:05:41] <%GhoulishCripple> I just killed a house in nioh2. I'm conflicted because it was a sick house but it attacked me
[0:05:42] <marvel877> @emperordread Either that or Omri, the kid from The Indian in the Cupboard.
[0:05:44] <%StephanieSadGirl> I truly wasted my money yesterday, asking how many babies Paige mpreged into the orb, since clearly the father is Plague-Sama
[0:05:47] <%DovaDude29> I‚Äôve seen maybe the first 3-4 hours of it, idk if it‚Äôs a game I‚Äôd find enjoyable to play. Lets see how pat feels bout it tho
[0:05:47] <wookie2085> Reload
[0:05:52] <Profmcstevie> Pats gonna flex his Psyche degree all night huh

[0:09:21] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> This will quickly become an emote only chat, unless he hates it
[0:09:35] <Sgww> @StaceMcGate i recall he hated the fact that it was first person when he played it but iunn remember if he ever went back to it after that stopped bothering him
[0:09:42] <marvel877> @Sgww was there supposed to be a vita version, i just remember steam and 3ds being the options during the kickstarter... and I backed the 3DS...yay.

[0:10:13] <%GhoulishCripple> @baddognobiscuits74 I've never played this game but pat hating it would be funny regardless
[0:10:16] <SatChamp> i mean he felt like celeste's message was trite, but the way this game explores those themes are a LOT different
[0:10:34] <%RealThiele> this game seems fun but stream poison
[0:10:53] <marvel877> I kinda hope Pat likes the game because maybe it will make me change my mind and actually play the game.
[0:11:04] <Profmcstevie> Stream poison isn't real, get better chats pattyDimmaDab

[0:11:58] <keviniscool> please do not spoil the fact that this game is secretly just a pizza delivery simulator

[0:13:15] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> The ost to this game is top notch though. I highly recommend it even if you dislike RPGs
[0:13:18] <+Liquid_Dio> ‚òÄ
[0:13:19] <AdellB> ah
[0:13:20] <bakkatohri> I bought Omori in the last winter sale. I like the art style. I hate the antiquated turn based RPG mechanics.
[0:13:26] <wendigo172> Huh
[0:13:37] <+coolthulhuu> omori is such a special game. I can't wait for this

[0:13:53] <DianaTheAscian> big excited for this one
[0:13:54] <+Shonen_hero> I fucking love Omori
[0:14:05] <%Trash_Leviathan> Trash_Leviathan subscribed at Tier 1. 
[0:14:08] <+Liquid_Dio> @bakkatohri You might just not like RPGs, lol
[0:14:11] <Ipsenscastle> man give me old style turn based mechanics all day, I never stopped loving it
[0:14:12] <%RealThiele> turn based jrpg gang
[0:14:30] <Trace_Bovier> I loved the story and art but hated the gameplay so I edited my savefile to have max attack and hp
[0:14:31] <MrPandastic> Omori is a neat game but if you don't like turn based RPG's this game won't really draw you in.
[0:14:37] <Sgww> @Dopamien if i cared abt pat a little less i would lol
[0:14:51] <SatChamp> @bakkatohri yeah it get's really old really fast, i guess it depends on the kind of attatchment you get the story on whether or not you see it through to the end
[0:14:54] <+Liquid_Dio> Reject action-RPG, return to turn-based
[0:14:56] <%DovaDude29> I like turned base rpgs, but it‚Äôs some bits of the story I‚Äôm not as big into (I‚Äôm not gonna say what, cause spoilers)
[0:15:23] <+sp_abadidea> i absolutely adore this game, but I think Pat would be better served turning off Chat

[0:17:11] <titlefight96> Absolutely turn off the chat for this like people will unintentionally spoil when *this moment* or *that moment* is about to happen like better to turn chat off during gameplay and bring it back during talking breaks etc.
[0:17:12] <+sp_abadidea> i had the privilege of watching one of my friends actually cry at a particular late-game scene. I don't think that will happen to Pat, but this game is sure full of gut punches

[0:25:37] <%Treuan> Shame me daddy
[0:25:38] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Did you see a couple months back charlie the unicorn concluded?
[0:25:38] <%doselfren> What about the people that enjoy being publicly shamed?

[0:25:49] <%NovaKnightmare> Did Pat get to the part where Lumpy from Star Wars eats Gumby?

[0:25:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> "Yo did he get to the point where they reveal what rosebud is?"
[0:25:59] <%ShinobiPhoenix> @patstaresat You should put it on Emote Mode, but People can pay you to talk, then at least people have to pay to spoil you
[0:26:01] <%emperordread> Still can't believe someone did that to Woolie's Disco playthrough
[0:26:15] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> or "Where's he at right now?"
[0:26:18] <%BlondieFDM> Hey I just showed up, what's happened so far in the stream? psaWhat
[0:26:23] <%cartakus> Nah
[0:26:24] <@ssjklyco> Emote mode only mods can talk
[0:26:26] <%GhoulishCripple> @novaknightmare no he just reached the part where lumpy pushes that guard off the edge
[0:26:28] <%atlasdotwav> That's genuinely helpful advice lowkey
[0:26:28] <%SveriSageAdvice> im still so pissed they spoiled the last part of Disco for Woolie
[0:26:28] <%king_wragles> No but like, pay extra
[0:26:31] <%StephanieSadGirl> @emperordread It was rude, but also like... woolie was being such a POS to the cryptozoologists both in game and out that he kinda deserved it
[0:26:32] <%PinkertonDanPie> what's happened so far in the stream. did he get to the part where the game says Omori on the title screen?
[0:26:36] <%SveriSageAdvice> at least Reggie was kept safe
[0:26:39] <%RealThiele> hahahaha silence the plebs
[0:26:41] <%Liquid_Dio> Pay 10 dollars per chat message, make it count
[0:26:44] <%RetroCop87> Woolie has no mods
[0:26:48] <%DovaDude29> What if you make a shot in the dark and guess what happens, but fuck up and get it right.  Now, is that a spoiler?
[0:26:55] <%Dakuu75> @PatStaresAt I think because not a lot of ppl in chat played it?
[0:26:55] <%SilvaChariot0133> Just don't read chat 4Head
[0:26:58] <%cartakus> Twitter?
[0:26:58] <%RealThiele> Woolie has no mods and his chat is a biiiiig heel
[0:27:00] <%baronouroboros> Woolie has no mods? really?
[0:27:01] <%Bluwizard21> @PatStaresAt Maybe cause it was so new? or maybe cause ur people ruined his game?
[0:27:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Woolie doesn't have enough mods
[0:27:02] <%StarOtter70> I remember a few times the chat was acting up, but I don't know if it was from spoilers
[0:27:02] <%StephanieSadGirl> You werent being a dick to the nicest lady in the game though
[0:27:06] <%baka_sugoi> dose he not have mods?
[0:27:07] <%MegadBlitz> does he actually not??
[0:27:08] <%Blank9> you only had one person spoil a thing moments before it happened
[0:27:10] <%BadDogNoBiscuits74> Does Woolie have no mods?
[0:27:13] <%livlinn> woolieVS woolieONEGUY
[0:27:16] <%CatastropheCorvid> Woolie's chat are shitheads to him sometimes.
[0:27:24] <%SpontaneousC> woolie's chat is toxic as hell sometimes
[0:27:25] <%SveriSageAdvice> there was that one guy who couldn't shut up about that secret you find in the fridge @PatStaresAt

[0:27:29] <%axamilli> axamilli subscribed with Prime. 
[0:27:29] <%D00msDayDan> Since people watched your playthrough they knew the spoilers to say in woolie‚Äôs chat
[0:27:37] <%RealThiele> yea Woolies chat are the toxic shiatheels
[0:27:39] <%DovaDude29> Does Minh also mod or does he only do editing?
[0:27:40] <%StaceMcGate> Woolie just has moobot, which just stops people from talking in caps
[0:27:40] <%RetroCop87> Remember how salty Woolie's chat over Little V telling them to stfu?
[0:27:42] <%atlasdotwav> woolieACCIDENT

[0:27:58] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> I don't know anything about Omori so I can't spoil it
[0:27:58] <%Monkeyweed21> Woolie kept shitting on Lena and so the people in chat started getting really heavy-handed with the "oh you'll regret that later" shit

[0:28:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> That was TERRIFYINGLY accurate Pat
[0:28:26] <%Futurecity10> I do it all the time
[0:28:27] <%Dakuu75> WUT!!! lol
[0:28:31] <%BinaryFireball> i know people who do that
[0:28:32] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @PatStaresAt Bro I put Woolie on 3x to 4x sometimes
[0:28:32] <%baka_sugoi> 5 SPEED sp00nREE
[0:28:32] <%cvp5127> talk faster
[0:28:32] <%BinaryFireball> and I hate it
[0:28:33] <%SharkMissile> Highest I can ever go is 1.5
[0:28:33] <%skizzuto> Oh yeah I do that all the time
[0:28:39] <%CalebHatesGames> i never want to live in 2x speed
[0:28:41] <%skizzuto> Get to watch twice the content that way!
[0:28:43] <%SharkMissile> I usually go at 1.25, you don't notice it after a awhile
[0:28:43] <%DovaDude29> @za7az oof. Man I have bad luck with predicting , so imma just ride the wind and not make any guesses psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:28:44] <%Monkeyweed21> @RealThiele Omori fans are just Undertale fans but less furry
[0:28:46] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I guess I am subbing to Pat and Priming Woolie
[0:28:47] <%Rookie_Balboa> its pretty easy to do you just click the cog on screen and hit 2x
[0:28:55] <%Shonen_hero> Shonen_hero subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 12 months! Yo Pat, glad to hear you're giving Kingmaker a fair shake. Sounds like you're having a good time. Out of curiosity, who's your favorite party member so far? Also good god, I get fucking sick of Linzi's barks
[0:28:58] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> YOUR EARS ARE WEAK, YOU MUST ENSWOLE THEM
[0:29:02] <%RetroCop87> is there anything worse then when the Souls fandom joins the chat?
[0:29:04] <%D00msDayDan> 2x is too much the fastest I go is 1.5x
[0:29:04] <%livlinn> Woolie has few mod people in chat recently
[0:29:15] <%za7az> @DovaDude29 Smart move lol. To be fair, in this game there are some easy predictions to make
[0:29:32] <%atlasdotwav> The answer is MM No
[0:29:33] <%StephanieSadGirl> I get really sad when I run out of pat and paige backup streams becuase it means no happy sounds in the backgroudn while I play stuff
[0:29:34] <%DovaDude29> @za7az piss
[0:29:35] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> I do 1.5-2x for most things and Woolie at 3x.
[0:29:36] <%SilvaChariot0133> It's SUPER strong tho
[0:29:36] <%Shonen_hero> lies
[0:29:38] <%StaceMcGate> HIGHEST DAMAGE PAT
[0:29:39] <@Ranryu692> Warrior is so fun
[0:29:40] <%Futurecity10> Its still fun for me
[0:29:42] <%genowyn> but the deeps
[0:29:43] <%ShinobiPhoenix> I know NOTHING about Omori at all
[0:29:51] <%cartakus> Dark knight is never okay
[0:30:00] <%RetroCop87> Pat, please tell Yoshi P to start selling XIV again, I want to start playing
[0:30:01] <%zacyzacyz> dont play this game it will spoil omori for you LUL
[0:30:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> BIG NUMBER
[0:30:07] <%RealThiele> DRK edgelords think damage = fun
[0:30:09] <%Blank9> I don't get talking about highest damage when it's 2% higher but survivability is like 30% down
[0:30:12] <%Kharinite> What's the most fun tank class to use in general?
[0:30:12] <@Spydurman> the only good Dark Knight is Batman
[0:30:15] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt I don't know if you addressed this yesterday but DBD re added Pinhead's Voice lines...This time by the original actor
[0:30:19] <%StephanieSadGirl> The ONLY thing I know about Omori is that Garrus Vakarian has the biggest dick on the citiadel
[0:30:28] <%Blank9> dark knight's extra damage is secretly just the damage the healer would've done gcd healing them back up
[0:30:29] <+keviniscool> keviniscool subscribed with Prime. 
[0:30:32] <%Monkeyweed21> b bu but the deeps tho /s\
[0:30:38] <%RealThiele> WAR is excellent
[0:30:40] <%StaceMcGate> PLD at the bottom imo
[0:30:43] <%Futurecity10> Dark knight is GOAT because of Blackest night
[0:30:52] <%RealThiele> PLD damage feels so weak
[0:31:07] <%Futurecity10> PLD has always sucked
[0:31:14] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Doesn‚Äôt blackest night  kill you if you fuck it up?
[0:31:14] <@Moobot> Hey folks, just a reminder! If you have Twitch connected to Discord, you can access the PSA Sub-Discord. Go to your User Settings, go to Connections, and click 'Join' on the PSA server under the Twitch connection.
[0:31:18] <%SharkMissile> This is so incredibly above my understanding
[0:31:20] <%AsherCaelum> PLD is extremely fun to play, but their damage is kinda meh
[0:31:20] <%Dakuu75> I really like PLD, using Cover and intervention and Passage of arms to block for your party, is fun
[0:31:21] <%StaceMcGate> PLD is the weakest tank by a wide margin atm in terms of damage
[0:31:37] <%Futurecity10> @SuckerPunchSyd No thats Living dead
[0:31:47] <%cartakus> What is the opposite to a edgelord?
[0:31:47] <%Amadeusguy> As a DRK for life, I feel constant pain
[0:31:51] <%Blank9> especially whm, because they want to spend lilies
[0:31:55] <%Rookie_Balboa> should I not be using those? Ive only leveled sage but the non casting heals are so good for emergencies
[0:31:56] <%StaceMcGate> but yeah Living Dead is the worst ability in the game
[0:31:58] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @futurecity10 aaah gotcha gotcha
[0:32:04] <%raggedwharfrat> Heya Pat, is that a ring on your finger?
[0:32:05] <%Futurecity10> I dont like how Warrior doesnt have a tank buster mitigation
[0:32:07] <%genowyn> Why is LD so bad and doesn't even have the lowest cd
[0:32:12] <%SilvaChariot0133> just bring a whm 4Head
[0:32:16] <%DovaDude29> Idk how your gonna feel about this game,  but remember to say not to pot, and yes to pizza. I learned that one from the DARE Lion back in 08 psaBig
[0:32:16] <%MegadBlitz> DRK gets to invuln before dying to ITS OWN INVUN
[0:32:24] <%Dakuu75> lol

[0:32:33] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[0:32:35] <%SveriSageAdvice> im so disappointed with DRK because i legit started enjoying it towards the end of Shadowbringers after getting bored of GNB
[0:32:38] <%Blank9> @Futurecity10 bloodwhetting is a 20% mitigation at least, and the 400 barrier too
[0:32:42] <%keviniscool> fuck yeah friday baby
[0:32:42] <%RealThiele> waow
[0:32:45] <%Nekros4442> @rookie_balboa the only reason you use gcd healing is if you absolutely have to or are saving a ogcd for a known mechanic coming up
[0:32:45] <%Marakami_Sadaneo> da pech?
[0:32:45] <%dalmek> 2 bloodstains? you should clean those up lol
[0:32:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:32:47] <@Ranryu692> I'll believe it when I see it LUL
[0:32:50] <%cartakus> Yayyyyy
[0:32:53] <%Dakuu75> "the schedule is gonna have 2 bloodstains" is kinda funny
[0:32:56] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @blank9 what level is bloodwhetting?
[0:32:59] <%Shonen_hero> I wish you could play Kingmaker live on stream, but I gotta be honest that shit's stream poison
[0:32:59] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt last few months has been the most consistent schedule you've ever had, what happened to you man? you changed Kappa

[0:33:18] <%Blank9> @SuckerPunchSyd 82, but it's an upgrade of raw intuition

[0:33:42] <%Necnill> pubby
[0:33:43] <%RealThiele> Raw intuition is the dungeon destroyer, bloodwhetting is just icing
[0:33:43] <%DovaDude29> Wait, is Omori the Amogus of earthbound? Think about it psaSmug
[0:33:43] <%atlasdotwav> I too imagine zangeif
[0:33:46] <%raggedwharfrat> I think Paige is gonna like the hammer personally
[0:33:46] <%StephanieSadGirl> oh god is he humping elmo?

[0:40:31] <%delilah4you> Now OTHER people can go "This tank SUCKS"
[0:40:31] <%LemonAgeKK> now its all the dps fault for  not killing good enough
[0:40:38] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Healing still terrifies me but whitemage is at 50 something
[0:40:47] <%dekkitout> Being a great healer is pretty tight
[0:40:51] <%king_wragles> It's why I can't not play scout in DRG. Bad scouts make everything hard

[0:41:12] <%Futurecity10> if the tank is not pulling every fucking mob in the dungeon they deserve to be kicked

[0:41:18] <%SuckerPunchSyd> WHAT???
[0:41:18] <%Nekros4442> dont be scared to be a healer. Welcome to god complex that comes from controlling the lives of ur entire party... .unless you have a warrior tank
[0:41:19] <%hoodedlefty> I unironically have less anxiety as Healer (unless the tank is an asshole) or tank than dps
[0:41:29] <%Monkeyweed21> REMEMBER WARS RUNNING DUNGEONS IN TANK STANCE
[0:41:29] <%ShinChris> What constitutes a bad tank?
[0:41:34] <%Nobrev> STOP TRYING TO KITE AUTO ATTACKS
[0:41:59] <%Brassnarwhal> i love tanking for that reason, i hate watching people just not use their cooldowns
[0:42:00] <%Shonen_hero> team work feats are fucking sick
[0:42:05] <%Blank9> a bad tank is one that doesn't use their cooldowns, spins the boss around, moves them around constantly
[0:42:17] <%RealThiele> teamwork feats + inquisitor is *chefs kiss*
[0:42:21] <%Monkeyweed21> @SuckerPunchSyd Tanks used to have a tank stance that made them do less damage but also take less damage and draw more aggro and a dps stance that just upped their damage but gave them no survivability. Cue the smoothbrains trying to speedrun
[0:42:26] <%SuckerPunchSyd> @shinchris usually not having the tank stance on, moving the boss, not using cool downs and such

[1:08:26] <%ataxia72> I think Pat might have some issues he needs to work through

[1:09:03] <%ataxia72> I *am* afraid of spiders, that's for sure!
[1:09:07] <%TubeMan642> Pat  has been getting real cynical lately huh?
[1:09:12] <%Dakuu75> in a lake?
[1:09:15] <%vaporousTippler> Well, it sucks water.
[1:09:17] <%StaceMcGate> just swim stupid psaSmug
[1:09:19] <%HotSauceFiend> having almost drowned once, this is true
[1:09:26] <%missingangle> Drowning is some of the worst ways to go
[1:09:26] <%doomunderthestairs> nah that just Pat
[1:09:27] <%Dakuu75> if it was the ocean, yeah, sure.
[1:09:27] <%sekri0> you can hang around the water and webs for a bit
[1:09:27] <%Amadeusguy> I have a friend who nearly drowned and he described it as horrendously painful
[1:09:29] <%SpontaneousC> as someone who almost drowned can confirm. Drowning sucks shit
[1:09:33] <%justcallmebobplease> You have to get drowned in the process of Navy Seal training, didja know that Pat?  MANDATORY.
[1:09:33] <%KishinGrek> hey gang, how is Omori?
[1:09:35] <%Amadeusguy> it seems like a real bad way to go
[1:09:39] <%Carl_BrutananadiIewski> I remember my dad shaking his head when I almost drowned at the beach as a kid
[1:09:39] <@Ranryu692> thank you Pat
[1:09:42] <%StarOtter70> psaDogchamp
[1:09:44] <%Baby_Hotpockets_> "you are afraid of dying"

[1:10:03] <%skizzuto> Ew stinky baby pig dog
[1:10:06] <%cartakus> This will be a feel good stream!
[1:10:07] <%HotSauceFiend> please tell me if he talking about elmo, paige or dog
[1:10:07] <%StaceMcGate> this would be a good outta context clip
[1:10:08] <%Monkeyweed21> oh no the shitfest of the last 2 years has recontextualized the game to the point the fear seems rational
[1:10:08] <%Deano8817> @KishinGrek we just started
[1:10:09] <%atlasdotwav> Have you tried just being immortal??
[1:10:11] <%SuckerPunchSyd> Tooth treat thingie @joshmanvgh
[1:10:11] <%HotSauceFiend> oh its dog
[1:10:12] <%ahame94> ahame94 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 6 months! Been watching your stuff for nearly a decade, hope to be here for another decade. Enjoy Omori, it's truly something special!
[1:10:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Thats what she said
[1:10:15] <%JoshManVGH> "You are afraid of mortal injury"
[1:10:20] <%missingangle> Pat stop making out with the dog
[1:10:22] <%rumtumtugnutz> Greenies are teeth cleaning treats for Doge
[1:10:23] <%dalmek> yes please
[1:10:23] <%Dakuu75> I like to tell myself, "I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of HOW I might die."
[1:10:23] <%rrratbastard> yeah pls
[1:10:26] <%StaceMcGate> no
[1:10:26] <%bassoontyphoon> Wow this is a soundbite goldmine
[1:10:26] <%Nordguy> ye
[1:10:26] <@Ranryu692> no, nuts suck
[1:10:26] <%greasypete00> that'll kill me
[1:10:27] <%Fooguwu> Yes please
[1:10:27] <%doc_ock_rokc> yes
[1:10:27] <%JustToWatch> Yes please
[1:10:27] <%Marakami_Sadaneo> cirNom
[1:10:28] <%JoshManVGH> Sure
[1:10:28] <%Shonen_hero> I think having a healthy fear of drowning is fine, but I think in this context it's specifically inhibiting Omori and keeps him from swimming. It's avoidance behavior

[1:14:01] <%Liquid_Dio> I always said it "Mah-ree" but there's no voices in this game anyway so whatever
[1:14:06] <%bassoontyphoon> @shonen_hero Mari
[1:14:06] <%ataxia72> Mar-ee is how I've always said it
[1:14:14] <%doc_ock_rokc> Make people laugh legit and they make a better picture
[1:14:21] <%rumtumtugnutz> My favorite thing about Yiik is the part where the developer tells you you're stupid for not liking Two Brothers.

[1:18:02] <%StaceMcGate> Gief is barking, because he has depression
[1:18:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The thing about this game is that its a bit obvious with its message so its less a game about depression and more a game about the cartoon example of depression

[1:22:45] <%Animatic_> this is gonna be a bit for a while...
[1:22:48] <%psidefx> "I'm gonna dip my b_lls in thousand island dressing... because I got depression"
[1:22:48] <%MidnightPacif1c> psaUp doing fine
[1:22:48] <%ataxia72> Pat's doing that thing where he goes into a game thinking he knows exactly what the game is and confirmation biases himself into hating it
[1:23:04] <%ataxia72> but also I think he'll like it
[1:23:11] <%JoshManVGH> It's a fun bit
[1:23:15] <%joodatious> classic pat

[1:25:35] <%capnshupe> @ataxia72 it'll either have depression or sleeve in it based on the last week
[1:25:47] <%Shonen_hero> I just hope Pat's discourse becomes a little more nuanced the more he play. I like the bit
[1:25:47] <%cvp5127> depression laugh
[1:25:58] <%Rookie_Balboa> its a funny but because throughout the game he‚Äôll be saying it in more and more dire situations
[1:26:00] <%Deano8817> depression sleeve will be the next podcast title

[2:14:51] <@Spydurman> now I get why people were promoting Emote Only mode
[2:15:01] <%superc37> eh the visuals more important than the dialogue tho

[2:15:09] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> it's fun to yell at pat though

[2:17:06] <%JobbedBone> 0/26 keys
[2:17:07] <%doc_ock_rokc> oh the land looks a bit like a heart!

[2:23:40] <%AsherCaelum> please help basil he's so precious

[2:24:11] <%AsherCaelum> Who knows
[2:24:13] <%JobbedBone> what does pat mean
[2:24:14] <%za7az> I thought it meant pizza Kappa
[2:24:14] <%Divryne> Omori spelled backwards is Ligma.
[2:24:15] <%CourageTheCat> who's steve jobs
[2:24:16] <%ataxia72> omori my balls
[2:24:17] <%JustToWatch> the S in omori stands for Strand
[2:24:19] <%HotSauceFiend> you say that but doki doki literature club didnt follow that rule
[2:24:19] <%Monkeyweed21> it means reading the mind of your opponent
[2:24:20] <%keviniscool> @keviniscool a funny, a good, a laugh if you will
[2:24:24] <%notgoodatnamessorry> it has a meaning, but not as its own word
[2:24:25] <%linSP> omori is that feeling when the pizza hits your eye
[2:24:26] <%HairballCT> who's steve jobs
[2:24:28] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> Omori DEEZ NUTS
[2:24:28] <%pokefan9956> omori means life
[2:24:28] <%StaceMcGate> @PatStaresAt has that ever happened to you with a game? Where the details were in the title but you didn't know the meaning?
[2:24:30] <%MidnightBurst12> who's steve jobs?
[2:24:31] <%atlasdotwav> It means STRAND
[2:24:31] <%AsherCaelum> omori means "no one gets left behind"
[2:24:31] <%Rookie_Balboa> So sad Steve Jobs died of Omori
[2:24:32] <%Blue_Que> omori means keikaku
[2:24:32] <%baka_sugoi> Bill Gates
[2:24:34] <%DashXero> A chronic condition, depending on who you are.
[2:24:36] <%RealThiele> keikaku means plan
[2:24:48] <%Rookie_Balboa> @MidnightBurst12 omori my balls
[2:24:49] <%CourageTheCat> NOT ROCKO AGAIN
[2:24:50] <%Shonen_hero> omori backwards iromo

[2:24:55] <%Monkeyweed21> bird up
[2:24:56] <%CourageTheCat> ELMO CANNOT ESCAPE
[2:24:58] <%joodatious> ITS A STAND GAME
[2:24:59] <%Tomokush> not really a spoiler but Toby Fox actually composed a guest song for this game, it was later used in Deltarune Chapter 2
[2:25:01] <%JobbedBone> aww
[2:25:02] <%ataxia72> ROCKO
[2:25:10] <%SaiyanShoto> Elmo is coming
[2:25:11] <%marusux> Oh chat said a funny, how cute
[2:25:12] <%keviniscool> HECTOR IS A ROCK HECTOR ISN'T ALIVVEEEEE
[2:25:12] <%joodatious> elmu
[2:25:15] <%sekri0> Hector isnt real, hector doesnt even  have a mouth
[2:25:16] <%ShogunNoonto> the o in omori stands fir omori
[2:25:21] <%joodatious> KILL THEM
[2:25:27] <@Ranryu692> Omori is an anagram of Morio - you're under attack by an enemy stand!
[2:25:28] <%Bluwizard21> kill all the cute things
[2:25:30] <%ataxia72> kill that adorable bunny rabbit KILL IT
[2:25:31] <%AsherCaelum> hector is real and my friend
[2:25:34] <%GallowsDrop> bnnuy
[2:25:35] <%Tomokush> the O in omori stands for O'reily auto parts
[2:25:36] <%linSP> KILL
[2:25:36] <%RealThiele> bnuy
[2:25:38] <%DashXero> This is nowhere near as nightmarish as that other thing.
[2:25:51] <%Shonen_hero> while you were being depressed, I studied the blade
[2:25:52] <%sekri0> Omori spends his time stabbing small animals
[2:25:57] <%marusux> This is neat looking
[2:25:59] <%JobbedBone> isn't killing small animals a sign of something?
[2:26:00] <%JustToWatch> The O in omori stand fro Ocelot. That's right Snake...
[2:26:06] <%AsherCaelum> Hopefully this idyllic pastel world doesn't have stairs, otherwise we're fucked
[2:26:21] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @JobbedBone a sign of studying the blade, of course, keep up
[2:26:40] <%Tomokush> Omori becoming the next Vergil
[2:26:50] <%bassoontyphoon> The o in OMORI stands for strand
[2:27:13] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> Omori doing Lunar Phases at sprout moles
[2:27:13] <%linSP> is omo a face like uwu
[2:27:30] <%Divryne> Kill all sad people got it.
[2:27:33] <%JobbedBone> good.
[2:27:42] <%Liquid_Dio> You're gettin it
[2:27:42] <%keviniscool> i like the neutral faces  they all look very no thoughts head empty
[2:27:47] <%joodatious> @linSP yes
[2:27:49] <%keviniscool> look at kel dumbass
[2:27:53] <%atlasdotwav> He's beginning to believe
[2:28:14] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> OH NO PAIGE JUST EXPLODED
[2:28:16] <%greasypete00> is paige breaking things agian
[2:28:21] <%JobbedBone> let it flow
[2:28:28] <%doc_ock_rokc> PAIGE HEARD THERE WAS VIOLENCE AND CAME TO WITNESS
[2:28:31] <%PinkertonDanPie> Omori is an anagram of Motio, as in Morioh Town from Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable
[2:28:44] <%Rookie_Balboa> omori is no longer depressed he is ANGRY
[2:28:49] <%Liquid_Dio> Early game is kinda risky but it balances out in your favor pretty quick
[2:29:00] <%Tomokush> also Pat there is a ton secrets that you can easily miss and not have to interact with at all. So take your time with certain areas if you feel like finding some spooky or funny stuff
[2:29:23] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @PinkertonDanPie Omori's full name is Johnathan J. Omori, or "JoJO" for short
[2:29:39] <%sekri0> I love swings
[2:29:48] <%keviniscool> many people are saying this
[2:29:58] <%FluorescentLB> FluorescentLB subscribed at Tier 1. 
[2:30:02] <%JobbedBone> bland spoilers slowly reduce the scope of what the game can possibly be, death by a thousand cuts Kappa nobody needs their hand held
[2:30:14] <%FluorescentLB> man that battle music is fire, subscribed to say that
[2:30:24] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> Sad stabs hit the hardest
[2:30:28] <%Liquid_Dio> Remember you can use Hero's Cook outside battle
[2:30:28] <%RealThiele> depression enhancees stabbing
[2:30:29] <%skizzuto> the enemy died before it could work
[2:30:31] <%atlasdotwav> Sad poem to self + stab
[2:30:52] <%joodatious> "so it is written"
[2:31:12] <%PinkertonDanPie> Johnathan J. Omori, and his stand Acrophobia that lets him use the microwave when the power is out.
[2:31:34] <%Tomokush> the sproutings are the best things in this game

[2:32:13] <%linSP> kel is just too squishy
[2:32:15] <%AlteisenReiseZ> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[2:32:22] <%Blue_Que> GOBLIN
[2:32:27] <%Liquid_Dio> There's no shame in running back to heal early game
[2:32:27] <%JobbedBone> hes ruined
[2:32:30] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> the dreaded XP death penalty
[2:32:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> You like making toast pat?
[2:32:32] <%JobbedBone> just stop leveling him at all
[2:32:32] <%Monkeyweed21> use a healing spell

[2:32:54] <%atlasdotwav> Restart the run
[2:33:00] <%general80> mirror
[2:33:08] <%keviniscool> run always works on normal fights
[2:33:13] <%DashXero> "nutritious candy" two words I never thought I'd see next to each other.
[2:33:20] <%JobbedBone> it already forced omori to be ahead so eh
[2:33:21] <%Tomokush> OMORI - DPS
[2:33:35] <%Tomokush> Aubrey is tank, Kel is support, and Hero is a healer
[2:33:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DashXero There are some candies made that are actually good for you...they just SUCK
[2:33:47] <%joodatious> BIG DAMAGE
[2:33:51] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @DashXero dried mango Kappa
[2:34:01] <%joodatious> gross
[2:34:11] <%joodatious> candy is supposed to be bad for you
[2:34:26] <%sekri0> you can set up big damage it gets pretty gross
[2:34:44] <%DashXero> Huh. Learned something new today.
[2:34:47] <%ChrisPlaysThing> A good mango is reasonably sweet
[2:34:49] <%doc_ock_rokc> He was angry
[2:34:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> thus dull
[2:34:55] <%JobbedBone> Reeses PB cups? body is going to have to take one for the team once more. Good luck future me!
[2:35:05] <%AsherCaelum> A good mnemonic to remember what emotion beats what is H>A>S>H, or HASH.
[2:35:17] <%Zundelle> fearful of bnuuy
[2:35:27] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Hash beats me pretty hard too Kappa
[2:35:29] <%sekri0> Kel goes first most of the time psaUp
[2:35:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> Baked apples are okay for you
[2:35:31] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> @AsherCaelum That's pretty good
[2:35:33] <%doc_ock_rokc> and tastey
[2:35:37] <%atlasdotwav> Loll
[2:35:47] <%TallGuyWithAHoodie> Hash browns are quite tasty
[2:36:02] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Baked apples and cinnamon is a good poor kid treat
[2:36:08] <%RealThiele> weed
[2:37:16] <%sekri0> other way around
[2:37:23] <%JobbedBone> cajun potato slices > any candy. Never understood sweets
[2:37:59] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Anyone ever had a Lafl√®che Doughnut? It's a piece of toasted white bread, buttered on both sides and then dusted with powdered sugar on each side.
[2:38:08] <%MidnightBurst12> always pet dog
[2:38:08] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Real poor kid tech
[2:38:15] <%RealThiele> toby?
[2:38:15] <%Tomokush> good dog
[2:38:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> THIS GAME PASSES "CAN YOU PET THE DOG" TEST
[2:38:31] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing bUT IT'S FRENCH, TO STAY CLASSY
[2:38:32] <%brisk_dacat> Nice
[2:38:36] <%Shonen_hero> look at all those consumables Pat will never use Kappa
[2:38:40] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing Caps lock weird

[2:39:03] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @cooldude69xx LUL nah it's cus Lafl√®che is like a french ghetto
[2:39:07] <%Rookie_Balboa> Kel is very Glass Cannon-y
[2:39:10] <%TheWinged7> oh no, hes toast LUL
[2:39:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> HEAL KEL EVERY ROUND
[2:39:25] <%Monkeyweed21> why not heal before the battle?
[2:39:27] <%AsherCaelum> Kel used tp be WEAKER, they had to buff his HP growth
[2:39:32] <%RealThiele> never heal kel, complain about breading
[2:39:36] <%Trash_Leviathan> ah yes the average kel experience
[2:39:54] <%Liquid_Dio> Kel is the floor DPS
[2:39:55] <%Rookie_Balboa> it's fine it all balances out towards the mid game
[2:39:56] <%Tomokush> god
[2:39:57] <%Shonen_hero> LUL
[2:40:01] <%JobbedBone> You can pet the dog in 2021 was the you can sit down as a mechanic in 2016
[2:40:06] <%notgoodatnamessorry> kel either dies every 10 seconds or one shots for, there is no in between
[2:40:10] <%pokefan9956> nooo. kel is great
[2:40:13] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing See, I dont speak french. You could have rolled with it, and I'd never knwo
[2:40:14] <%Tomokush> why would you hate the stand-in Ryuji
[2:40:41] <%keviniscool> getting very good at bunny murder
[2:40:45] <%ChrisPlaysThing> Never, I embrace the poor upbrining iI had LUL
[2:40:51] <%DashXero> Poor Kel... Forever in the shadow of Kenan.
[2:41:06] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing I respect it
[2:41:37] <%ChrisPlaysThing> though i'm anglophone, so i can't claim full rights to it
[2:42:40] <%Monkeyweed21> Omori has too much bitch in his heart
[2:42:42] <%ChrisPlaysThing> This game is cute
[2:42:49] <%DashXero> Depressed rabbit is a mood.
[2:43:07] <%JobbedBone> rabbite looking mf
[2:43:17] <%Shonen_hero> simple and clean
[2:43:21] <%joodatious> slaughter the bnuy
[2:43:37] <%Blank9> good art and music
[2:43:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> FUCK YOU SAD RABBIT
[2:44:19] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing The older I get, the more I realize I was poor growing up and my mom just did a great job hiding it
[2:44:32] <%Rookie_Balboa> simple but fun yeah its great
[2:44:35] <%Shonen_hero> yeah I try not to go out of my way to grind, but killing everything in your way will get you the levels you need
[2:44:35] <%Trash_Leviathan> lets go rabbit genocide
[2:44:44] <%Liquid_Dio> It does a good job of being more than just a bog-standard RPGMaker turn-based but not overly complex
[2:44:56] <%ataxia72> yeah it's a really enjoyable system once you get it down
[2:45:01] <%JobbedBone> people with emotions are the real problem. You're supposed to shoulder those burdens until you die. Its the Japanese way!
[2:45:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cooldude69xx yeah that is normal. My mah was a regular budget art mcgyiver
[2:45:19] <%sekri0> My doorknob broke so now i have to attach it like Resident Evil whenever I have to exit the kitchen
[2:45:26] <%joodatious> i had the opposite, my parents where just fine they just chose to neglect me and spoil my siblings :)
[2:46:13] <%ChrisPlaysThing> @cooldude69xx yeah, I didn't notice until decades later talking with non-poor kids lol
[2:46:13] <%joodatious> she loves beating them
[2:46:23] <%cooldude69xx> @doc_ock_rokc I just wish she passed on some of the hacks. My best money saving moves are basic car care
[2:46:28] <%joodatious> B
[2:46:35] <%sekri0> B
[2:46:48] <%Blue_Que> B
[2:46:51] <%keviniscool> Butt
[2:46:52] <%Divryne> B for BITCH.
[2:46:54] <%Celarious> B
[2:46:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> @cooldude69xx best way to save money is to stay at home
[2:46:59] <%JobbedBone> crusty B
[2:47:07] <%ChrisPlaysThing> It did give me an outlook on life of just wanting happiness for the ones o care about, since i could take anything at this point
[2:47:11] <%cooldude69xx> @ChrisPlaysThing "You guys remember sharing the potato sacks with  your brother? What do you mean no?"
[2:47:14] <%ChrisPlaysThing> I*
[2:47:19] <%Rookie_Balboa> some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill
[2:47:24] <%PlaidisTheNewPlaid> I have no idea what this game is, but I must say, it is mildly depressing. Good job developers?
[2:47:26] <%sekri0> Studied the Blade
[2:47:31] <%Liquid_Dio> While you were being happy, Omori studied the blade
[2:47:34] <%Trash_Leviathan> omori studies the blade
[2:47:50] <%JobbedBone> shink~
[2:47:57] <%cooldude69xx> I appreciate determined bunny
[2:48:07] <%JobbedBone> hes fired up!
[2:48:16] <%doc_ock_rokc> WHILE YOU WERE PLANTING FLOWERS OMORI STUDIED THE BLADE (with his guts)
[2:49:01] <%rrratbastard> hero's the all-around guy that everyone loves!
[2:49:03] <%Trash_Leviathan> yeah hero is great
[2:49:04] <%JobbedBone> he wrote the book on fighting, yo
[2:49:11] <%JobbedBone> literally
[2:49:11] <%joodatious> Aubrey is there to give the buff "girls are watching"

[3:43:56] <%justcallmebobplease> @MelBrooksKA Yes, purchase Pat.
[3:43:57] <%StephanieSadGirl> @joodatious maxmor2Teefs maxmor2Teefs maxmor2Teefs
[3:43:58] <@Ranryu692> Dark Souls, unfortunately
[3:43:59] <%linSP> convergance?
[3:44:02] <%greasypete00> yeyeye
[3:44:03] <%Monkeyweed21> Longma
[3:44:09] <%cooldude69xx> Pat so good at having a schedule
[3:44:18] <%DovaDude29> Kinda a bummer pat ain‚Äôt coming back to this, but aight
[3:44:23] <%cooldude69xx> @Monkeyweed21 Longmaballs
[3:44:34] <%StephanieSadGirl> @DovaDude29 Atleast he liked it
[3:44:55] <%DovaDude29> Fair
[3:45:19] <%Monkeyweed21> @cooldude69xx you forgot the first and middle name, Dragyourtongue A.
[3:45:32] <%keviniscool> it really do be stream cancer,,, very good game tho
[3:45:55] <%StephanieSadGirl> @Monkeyweed21 But that has the false assertion that any of it is long enough to perform that action upon.
[3:46:51] <%DovaDude29> Honestly I‚Äôd  be aight if it was just the base cozy game, and if it didn‚Äôt have the irl depression twist thing. Idk, but I‚Äôm aight if earthbound inspired games don‚Äôt have a twist or hidden story thing, it can have fun writing and a neat game mechanic and be good with that
[3:47:02] <%DovaDude29> Ya know?
[3:47:19] <%Rookie_Balboa> @DovaDude29 Yeah but the devs wanted to tell the story, as it obviously meant a lot to them
[3:48:14] <%StephanieSadGirl> @DovaDude29 exactly
[3:48:24] <%Liquid_Dio> @DovaDude29 If you saw the rest of the game you'd probably change your mind, so check it out yourself!
[3:48:41] <%justcallmebobplease> The smart move
[3:48:42] <%StephanieSadGirl> Thats like saying 'Hellblade was great, but I wish it didnt have all of the DID stuff'
[3:48:42] <%Rookie_Balboa> Paige would cry over this game
[3:48:46] <%Rookie_Balboa> in a good way
[3:48:53] <@Ranryu692> oh no, I can't talk in emote mode in her streams :(
[3:48:54] <%Celarious> Yes
[3:48:56] <%justcallmebobplease> Paige would cry a redonkulous amount
[3:48:58] <%StephanieSadGirl> Emote mode, I am POSITIVE I could still make a quality shitpost with just emotes
[3:48:59] <%linSP> but mimimi
[3:49:00] <%DovaDude29> Well sure in omori‚Äôs case it seems so, but what I mean is that they don‚Äôt all have to have something like that. Some could do well if it was just the good writing and  unique game mechanic
[3:49:05] <%doomunderthestairs> woolieONEGUY
[3:49:39] <%Blank9> I'd rather see more huntdown and monolith
[3:49:43] <%SenpaiMD> Omori is very Mother 3 core
[3:49:55] <%StephanieSadGirl> What is worse, him chewing his bone on the cables, or him masturbating on the couch on stream?
[3:50:39] <%DovaDude29> @liquid_dio idk if imma play it myself, cause the other stuff ain‚Äôt my cup of joe. If I wanna play a horror game then yeah, but at first glance / 1 stream of watching nah I‚Äôm good. Might look at the gameplay online tho
[3:51:01] <%MidnightBurst12> FACTS
[3:51:10] <%linSP> true
[3:51:14] <%doomunderthestairs> yeah huge improvement from 1
[3:51:15] <%justcallmebobplease> THEY SHOULD HAVE
[3:51:15] <%joodatious> yeah probably
[3:51:21] <%MidnightBurst12> or just made KH2 again
[3:51:27] <%SirGO0SE> just dont play any of them :)
[3:51:31] <%justcallmebobplease> Tho Donald Zettaflaring a mofo was pretty rad.
[3:51:31] <%joodatious> kingdom hearts ends at 2
[3:51:31] <%Liquid_Dio> @DovaDude29 It's more than just horror, but if you'd rather watch someone else play it that's totally fine
[3:51:42] <%Blank9> kh2 is a better ending
[3:51:49] <%justcallmebobplease> Game music: RESTORED
[3:51:49] <%Monkeyweed21> and then skip to RE:MIND
[3:51:56] <%StephanieSadGirl> Look at those burgers LOOK AT THOSE BURGERS
[3:52:11] <%ClericOfSparda> yup
[3:52:11] <%AncelDeLambert> gnawgnawgnaw
[3:52:12] <%justcallmebobplease> We are
[3:52:23] <%Monkeyweed21> the super bosses in re:mind are the 2nd best KH game after 2
[3:52:26] <@ssjklyco> He chew chew cheeews it
[3:52:26] <%MidnightBurst12> look at that gremlin
[3:52:26] <%StephanieSadGirl> This looks very awkward ngl

[3:53:08] <@PrefectusCorgi> Not your type of stream
[3:53:09] <%RealThiele> called it
[3:53:10] <%Zebroneath> People have streamed it, but yeah....a lot of them were sub/emote only
[3:53:11] <%Marakami_Sadaneo> Omori should be a Paige stream tbh
[3:53:17] <%Monkeyweed21> yea 13 sentinels this shit
[3:53:34] <%StephanieSadGirl> You and Paige doing a stream of it together, sharing lines like in undertale?
