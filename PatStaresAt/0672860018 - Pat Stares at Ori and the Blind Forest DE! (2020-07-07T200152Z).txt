[0:34:08] <+Socar1989> can you choose to get beaten instead? 400 bucks is harsh
[0:34:13] <%Deadpal> if ONLY THEY DID THAT
[0:34:15] <%sporeian94> Cops don't give a shit anymore
[0:34:15] <Shwepie> Mask traps.
[0:34:17] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> It was your fault for having the dark blue one instead of the other dark blue one.
[0:34:18] <%Deadpal> but the cops REFUSE TO DO IT.
[0:34:21] <%TheStarbecue> TheStarbecue subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 18 months! is it month? proceed with stream
[0:34:22] <%Fooguwu> strap masks that lock onto their heads

[0:34:27] <%Deadpal> I wish I could trust the cops to even do that.
[0:34:30] <FunkyStreams> But do masks actually ven help tho?
[0:34:30] <Melchior_the_Wise> Just tell the cops they're racist
[0:34:34] <Storm_Samurai> Why is your mask over your eyes
[0:34:34] <%Deadpal> because they DON'T BELIEVE in masks either
[0:34:36] <%maskofmichael> blm

[0:34:58] <%WackyGear> @PatStaresAt I saw someone on Reddit make a great point of, why can people complain about snowflakes then complain about being forced to wear a mask.
[0:35:00] <Melchior_the_Wise> I'll take my freedom with a side of Fries thank you very much
[0:35:04] <FunkyStreams> We allow you to live elsewhere
[0:35:05] <chhdez> Masks work by scaring the corona by making it think we dont have real faces

[0:35:22] <Shwepie> Washington state governor was stupid a few weeks ago. In the same breath his said we're going to mandatory masks he said they won't be enforcing it legally. Hate him more with each passing day.
[0:35:33] <+Pesuto> @Socar1989 when the alternative is risking getting stuck in a ventilator for 3 months because your body is too weak to do it cause of covid (or getting someone in that situations instead), versus paying 400$ because you're too lazy to wear a mask, I'd say the latter is fair play
[0:35:33] <BoneofMalkav> That's a lot of Macaroni too
[0:35:37] <jorniev> did you see inaros prime?

[0:38:03] <%BeezusHrist> @WackyGear Kanye is confirmed to be bipolar and he's most likely a sociopath or something adjacent to it
[0:38:03] <%Roflmag> Is he planning to do will of the wisps after this one?

[0:38:37] <%BeezusHrist> @jorniev Decision will be reversed in January
[0:38:41] <%fingalights> I think most people who would vote for Kanye wouldn't have voted so I don't think those would count as "Stolen" votes
[0:38:46] <%TheStarbecue> no
[0:38:47] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Kanye doesn't need actual legislation, he's just there to divert votes away from legitimate candidates
[0:38:55] <FunkyStreams> oh, okay
[0:39:08] <%LymanAl> Yeezy for preezy
[0:39:10] <%BeezusHrist> @fingalights You can't "vote for Kanye" because he hasn't filed in election paperwork
[0:39:11] <%TheStarbecue> now i just feel awkward for joking about deaf ppl
[0:39:13] <%WhereIsWill> twitch does have CC if ya set it up
[0:39:14] <%WackyGear> @BeezusHrist I'm not surprised

[0:40:06] <%fingalights> @BeezusHrist That too, but even if he gets filed in for the states he could still, I really don't think the votes he gets would have been voters to begin with

[0:42:47] <+NitronStreams> LUL
[0:42:51] <Storm_Samurai> i don't even remember that game having a desert
[0:42:53] <FunkyStreams> Maybe its because Guerilla are better at making grimy sci fi shooters with sick weapons and color pallets.
[0:43:00] <$Mofirelizard> pat big brain

[0:43:14] <Coystick> @BeezusHrist I don't like any of the characters I've seen
[0:43:16] <%kindashagg> 1/4
[0:43:26] <%Retinolgaming> Desert is where the game starts for real
[0:43:29] <Psyramics> its the first place you get to after you leave the prologue zone
[0:43:35] <brian_peppers1> gonna be playin on PC?
[0:43:38] <Tdannzy> I’d say 1/3
[0:43:39] <chhdez> @Joustar_ Good ol Mexico
[0:43:45] <%BeezusHrist> @Coystick That doesn't mean the story sucks. The story is actually quite well written. Post post apocalyptic world

[0:44:13] <%LymanAl> @NitronStreams first, loser
[0:44:16] <%bevyrage> i personally don't like horizon due to too much of its charm being in novelty imo
[0:44:22] <FunkyStreams> I don't get the hype behind that game.Fromsoft got to it about 2 years ago.
[0:44:27] <%bevyrage> but i'm willing to give it a chance if i'm not the one playing it
[0:44:34] <+Delenay> just bounce off him
[0:44:35] <Shwepie> You can Y enemies too.
[0:44:36] <%BeezusHrist> @Coystick Really? Bad characters? ***
[0:44:37] <%Starotter70> psaCaw
[0:44:45] <%kindashagg> I have this weird feeling of only being interested in Tsushima because that first trailer looks like Kurosawa
[0:44:48] <%WhereIsWill> ghosts of CHUNGUS
[0:44:48] <FunkyStreams> The Siege character?
[0:44:49] <TioXyco> Ghost of Sashimi?

[0:45:22] <%worldbrand> you can break that wall by throwing the bird into it
[0:45:27] <%worldbrand> ... i think
[0:45:27] <%fingalights> Ghost of Sumimasen
[0:45:37] <%mMayrro> probably should have shoved the bird on that
[0:45:37] <%worldbrand> there's another way to break it later though
[0:45:40] <jorniev> KROGMAN
[0:45:52] <%BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt I think you rally might like the story of HZD... especially with how we are in 2020 LUL

[0:46:52] <%Joustar_> @chhdez looking it up now
[0:46:53] <+FoolsArcade> Thanks for the PridePog @tinyswampthing
[0:46:55] <%ArcanumArcanum> Nothing wastes time more than trying to save time
[0:47:03] <%GarbageNirvana> The whole krogans having four balls thing was an off-handed comment in the first game and then the other two just wouldn't shut the fuck up about it
[0:47:03] <%Starotter70> Thanks for the PrideKoala @tinyswampthing
[0:47:03] <%DappercatEsquire> FIRST TRY

[0:47:19] <%Razixx> !uptime
[0:47:20] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 47m 28s.
[0:47:23] <%worldbrand> i dunno, bash is probably my favourite movement mechanic in a 2D game
[0:48:02] <Ipsenscastle> @GarbageNirvana I wish they'd remake the first game with the gameplay of 2/3, it had the best story by a lightyear
[0:48:08] <%Starotter70> psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace psaCaw psaMenace psaMenace psaMenace

[0:48:20] <%WhereIsWill> did plague ever fix his oculus issues??
[0:48:33] <StrawberryBandit> D:
[0:48:35] <filialpails> kill one bird with multiple stones
[0:48:44] <%BeezusHrist> @Fooguwu you have to stipulate that it has to be without lube, otherwise it could be pleasurable
[0:48:45] <%mMayrro> what a stumbo

[0:49:00] <Ipsenscastle> why are you trying to murder this bird
[0:49:02] <Melchior_the_Wise> not that soft shit
[0:49:21] <Shwepie> @Ipsenscastle It is trying to murder you so it's only fair.
[0:49:23] <%weissguard> Deku Leaf that isn't magic reliant GET!
[0:49:25] <%kindashagg> Ori uses every part of the animal
[0:49:37] <%BeezusHrist> @tinyswampthing A lot of stuff on youtube and building computers that could be a good resource
[0:49:38] <Ipsenscastle> Ori is a fucking apex predator murder machine, this game is more dissonant than Uncharted
[0:49:45] <FunkyStreams> Pat do think you'll buy a new GPU this gen/
[0:50:02] <FunkyStreams> Yeah, probs not. I agree.
[0:50:11] <%mMayrro> saturation went UP
[0:50:13] <FunkyStreams> fuck

[0:50:18] <%BeezusHrist> RTX 3000 series
[0:50:18] <Psyramics> Honestly, just reading the manual that came with my motherboards was enough for me to build my computers
[0:50:30] <FrostedZaibatsu> Yeah this game iss shockingly hard
[0:50:32] <StrawberryBandit> wait you can explode the armor off the rhinos? huh.
[0:50:33] <@commanderclaw> The new GPUs this fall will be great if the leaks are even half true
[0:50:41] <%WhereIsWill> just bought the 5700xt it rulez

[0:51:41] <%tinyswampthing> Beezushirst i thought about it but just picking out the parts flared up my anxiety pretty bad so im just being safe
[0:51:52] <%ItsCaptainDisco> When's Zone of the Enders, damn it
[0:51:55] <FrostedZaibatsu> Isnt Control like one of the most demanding game that recently came out? Didnt Pat's pc run that?
[0:52:01] <%BeezusHrist> @tinyswampthing Ahh, ok
[0:52:17] <Profmcstevie> It is not merciful at the least
[0:52:18] <%worldbrand> yes and yes

[0:53:46] <%jowi_time> I don't have space for em so i dont care
[0:53:52] <FunkyStreams> @BeezusHrist must've had a bad souce of that information then.
[0:53:58] <Psyramics> @FunkyStreams no? $600 was disastrous for PS3, they'll never go that high again
[0:53:59] <%WhereIsWill> just remember chat, JJ can 100% this game practically blind psaSmug psaSmug

[0:54:49] <%jowi_time> LUL
[0:54:50] <FrostedZaibatsu> @BeezusHrist Ryzen 5 2600, and a GTX 1070ti
[0:54:51] <%worldbrand> the feather
[0:54:58] <%WhereIsWill> ight that was a dick move LUL
[0:54:58] <+Delenay> now the game begins
[0:55:00] <%AncelDeLambert> combat sucks in this game, they really should have cut it in favor of mobility mechanics
[0:55:05] <%maenos2> spikes bad
[0:55:34] <Herb_guy> Belive in yourself Patt! ( or not I mean it's your life..)
[0:56:01] <%BeezusHrist> @FrostedZaibatsu Even though that Ryzen chip is fairly new, that would be your problem
[0:56:01] <%maenos2> I heard not getting hit helps
[0:56:36] <FunkyStreams> @Herb_guy Pat has made a career out of doing the exact opposite.
[0:56:58] <+TsunamiPoro> spooky time
[0:57:04] <%worldbrand> dont worry about it
[0:57:08] <Shwepie> Laser spam is far and away the weakest attack, everything else is so much better,
[0:57:15] <Profmcstevie> The woods, they boggle the minds of those who enter~ usedStare
[0:57:30] <FunkyStreams> oh no
[0:57:36] <%alaric728> @alaric728 is new here. Say hello! HeyGuys
[0:58:18] <FrostedZaibatsu> @BeezusHrist I was thinking of upgrading it but, im alright with the performance. its just that one game
[0:58:20] <%BeezusHrist> @FrostedZaibatsu I bet your GPu is overclocked too....
[0:58:20] <%BeastlyKO> hello
[0:58:32] <Herb_guy> @funkystreams I know I'm trying to trick him shhhhh....
[0:58:41] <%chainedwolfstress> @alaric728 PrideWave
[0:59:06] <%Skittlesoul> @alaric728 PrideHeyyy
[0:59:16] <FrostedZaibatsu> Naw, i havent overclocked anything.
[0:59:18] <FunkyStreams> @Herb_guy Ah, I see. Very par for the course.
[0:59:57] <%NoHoldsBarredProductions> NoHoldsBarredProductions subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Happy 4 months!
[1:00:11] <%BeezusHrist> @FrostedZaibatsu You should, it'll turn your 1070 TI into the equivalent of a 1080 TI which is a motherfucking BEAST
[1:00:18] <ahmz1404> is he playing on hard
[1:00:22] <%xWanderingFlame> PrideKoala
[1:00:38] <akaoridux> whats more confusing, misty woods or sky's house
[1:00:43] <%BeezusHrist> 1080 TI won the 2010s LUL
[1:00:46] <Daskolin> Ah yes Pat and the Mustard Forest
[1:01:01] <Herb_guy> @funkystreams Better par than boogie then again I'm sure someone likes boogies
[1:01:06] <%GarbageNirvana> Thing about overclocking is if you don't have a really effective cooling method it cuts the life of your GPU drastically
[1:01:10] <%AncelDeLambert> more like an ability fern
[1:01:15] <%worldbrand> watch out pat
[1:01:17] <%GarbageNirvana> So be aware of that
[1:01:17] <%LymanAl> rekt
[1:01:30] <narusao> LUL
[1:01:37] <%DappercatEsquire> no but Pat, watch out
[1:01:37] <FunkyStreams> @FrostedZaibatsu Most the time GPU manufacturers clock their hardware at a very conservative setting. Just follow an OC guide and you'll get a lot more horsepower outta that brick.
[1:01:47] <%BeezusHrist> @GarbageNirvana Good thing we're enter a new console gen so prices on older SKUs are sure to fall
[1:02:05] <%GarbageNirvana> true nuff
[1:02:07] <FrostedZaibatsu> @BeezusHrist ive tried, but was too scared. Had system problems and didnt want to ruin my rig being stupid

[1:05:18] <%Fooguwu> "why are they killing themselves? why does it hurt me so much? I'm just gonna die." Listening to this from bed makes this sound REAL dark
[1:05:22] <FunkyStreams> Was this made by the same studio that made limbo?
[1:05:47] <%worldbrand> this was moon's first game but i dont know if any of their team came from other notable projects
[1:05:56] <%BeezusHrist> hate when fodderr is tough
[1:05:58] <ahmz1404> reflect their spit for a quicker kill
[1:05:59] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, people are a curse, unfortunately
[1:06:22] <StarsCrusader> Yeah, combat was a bit of a chore in Ori 1
[1:06:33] <%worldbrand> apparently their next game is an ARPG
[1:06:37] <%ArcanumArcanum> i like how pat managed to bug out his menu here
[1:06:43] <%heartlesshealer> Pat, perhaps you should invest in the blue ability tree later
[1:06:45] <%mMayrro> man imagine playing this part with some weed
[1:07:03] <%worldbrand> well, an "action rpg", which could mean just about anything
[1:07:23] <%BeezusHrist> i'm not getting ghost, but I'd appreciate if pat played it; getting Death Stranding
[1:07:25] <FunkyStreams> @worldbrand imagine this entire game taking place inside a nug.

[1:12:30] <Zebens> Oh, i remember this game
[1:12:43] <%BeezusHrist> and creepiest game you may ever play
[1:12:46] <Zepper202> Hey Pat, how are you liking the game so far?
[1:12:47] <Zebens> What difficulty is this?
[1:13:01] <FunkyStreams> Yeah, enemies have health bars in this.
[1:13:13] <FunkyStreams> Some Dark Souls shit right there.
[1:13:17] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[1:13:38] <Zebens> oh the Forest part
[1:13:42] <OlavOlavsson> So you're saying this is the dark souls of mario games
[1:13:45] <%BeezusHrist> SubTerrania: ***
[1:14:01] <%xWanderingFlame> PridePaint
[1:14:35] <%WhereIsWill> explosions!
[1:14:51] <Zepper202> Shame that the ability you get in this area is the lamest in the whole game
[1:14:52] <FunkyStreams> I think Salt and Sactuary takes that cake. But this seems pretty difficult.
[1:15:09] <Zebens> Did Pat do the Water Tree yet?
[1:15:10] <%ArcanumArcanum> You can hurt them more if you launch their projectiles back at them
[1:15:15] <OlavOlavsson> so is this metroidvania or linear?
[1:15:16] <Zebens> or whatever it's called/
[1:15:24] <%heartlesshealer> Pat did the water tree first stream
[1:15:24] <%xWanderingFlame> ncshappyMommy
[1:15:30] <+Delenay> charge bomb them
[1:15:41] <Zepper202> Yeah he did Ginso Tree last time
[1:15:41] <Zebens> nice
[1:15:54] <Shwepie> Yeah, your laser spam is a squirt gun compared to every other option you have.
[1:15:57] <%azure22900> You need to shoot their own projectiles at them for more damage.
[1:16:01] <Zebens> for some reason my potato PC can;t really handle the water tree that well
[1:16:05] <Zebens> too many things moving
[1:16:09] <Zebens> many frames were lost
[1:16:17] <Zepper202> f
[1:16:31] <%heartlesshealer> Enjoy your object escort, pat
[1:16:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> GET READY
[1:16:58] <%xWanderingFlame> GET SET

[1:17:12] <Zebens> LUL
[1:17:24] <%heartlesshealer> D:
[1:17:29] <%Joustar_> now do it
[1:17:31] <%BeezusHrist> @Zebens Can you choose the Vulkan API under the graphical settings for this game?
[1:17:38] <Daskolin> Thanks for the PrideCrown @daws_combine
[1:17:41] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat you're not using your strongest damage tool, which is launching projectiles back at enemies
[1:17:42] <%xWanderingFlame> LUL
[1:17:43] <%maenos2> @dappercatesquire sorry to hear :(
[1:17:44] <%azure22900> Pat throw their projectiles back at them, you'll kill them super quick.

[1:17:58] <%xWanderingFlame> F
[1:18:10] <Zebens> @BeezusHrist not sure, it's been like a year since i played the Definitive Edition of this game
[1:18:14] <%heartlesshealer> Game rewards counters
[1:18:16] <Apolar_> Gotta spam that save. Pain will teach you
[1:18:23] <Profmcstevie> it's as strong as you make it with your ability points
[1:18:32] <%BeezusHrist> @Zebens Or I hear this game has frame rate issues because it uses the Unity engine. If you can, try playing it with a borderless fullscreen
[1:18:48] <Zepper202> Now you're thinking
[1:18:53] <%BeezusHrist> @Zebens Ahh, ok
[1:19:02] <%maenos2> wow that seemed annoying
[1:19:09] <Zebens> @BeezusHrist I think I played it in Windowed, like most of my games
[1:19:10] <%azure22900> Also you really need to self heal more
[1:19:23] <%Deadpal> yes
[1:19:24] <%mMayrro> yeah a whole bunch of times
[1:19:25] <%Deadpal> that's me with persona games.
[1:19:26] <%LaughingCatt> yup
[1:19:30] <%maskofmichael> Yes
[1:19:30] <%doc_ock_rokc> a few times
[1:19:30] <%Joustar_> I know that feel
[1:19:32] <%count_bob> Tons.
[1:19:34] <%count_bob> Persona 5.
[1:19:36] <StarsCrusader> I guess Metroidvanias were never really your thing
[1:19:38] <%BeezusHrist> @Zebens potato
[1:19:38] <%ArcanumArcanum> The combat is SOOO much better in the 2nd game
[1:19:38] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WAT
[1:19:40] <Amakuni1> Yes Okami
[1:19:43] <%ArcanumArcanum> it's definitely a slog in this one
[1:19:48] <%Deadpal> It's personal taste.
[1:19:49] <%heartlesshealer> Yeah, lots of games
[1:19:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> the genre doesn't sit will with you or you just don't jive with it
[1:19:53] <Shwepie> Stomp, especially with the upgrade, is stupidly good.
[1:19:54] <%LaughingCatt> Thats how I feel about Sekiro
[1:19:54] <Zebens> @BeezusHrist yep
[1:19:56] <%maskofmichael> It's too good
[1:19:57] <Zepper202> Blind Forest was not designed for combat, so all the forced combat areas are really annoying
[1:19:58] <%xWanderingFlame> Okami
[1:20:01] <+ccwettr123> that's me and the 3d mario games. I KNOW they're good, I just can't get myself to like them
[1:20:02] <%Joustar_> Dead Cells does that to me
[1:20:03] <HollowMan190> yeah I played Last of us
[1:20:05] <%mMayrro> let paige play and backseat her LUL
[1:20:06] <%BeezusHrist> @ArcanumArcanum Because the second game is Hollow Knight LUL
[1:20:07] <CMash2k> the worst part is knowing that your tastes are the problem
[1:20:09] <%AmazingBlanket> How I felt about this game too
[1:20:12] <Herb_guy> Yeah it's called getting old and not enjoying the things you liked in the past biggest OOF
[1:20:18] <ToneBacas> oh
[1:20:22] <%heartlesshealer> oof
[1:20:24] <+l3sovikk> l3sovikk subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 9 months! TWITCH BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[1:20:29] <Storm_Samurai> combat is vastly improved in the 2nd game
[1:20:30] <ToneBacas> i agree
[1:20:31] <%Joustar_> O O F
[1:20:34] <%ssjklyco> Terrible or you just bad?
[1:20:35] <Apolar_> They completely change it on the second one
[1:20:35] <%heartlesshealer> Thanks for the PrideUwu @l3sovikk
[1:20:35] <+Delenay> good thing the next game is nothing but combat? its completely different
[1:20:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ORI 2
[1:20:39] <Zebens> Maybe try the next game
[1:20:39] <Profmcstevie> So would everyone, including the devs
[1:20:40] <Zepper202> WotW improved on the combat 100 fold
[1:20:48] <a_mad_dragon> the combat is 100 times better in ori 2
[1:20:49] <%ArcanumArcanum> @BeezusHrist more games needs to be Hollow Knight, to be fair
[1:20:52] <@commanderclaw> For me it's the new Tomb Raider games
[1:20:54] <Zebens> Time for Ori 2
[1:20:54] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Ori 2 literally fixes that
[1:20:57] <Zepper202> Yeah, if you want good combat play the sequel
[1:21:08] <%luftraumm1> bash changes the game pretty drastically
[1:21:09] <%xWanderingFlame> Ori 2 is goty
[1:21:13] <%heartlesshealer> It's just that projectiles as platforms/reflect-attacks doesn't hit your brain right and it's fine. Just means not for you
[1:21:16] <FunkyStreams> Elmo and the streamer that has a Blinf Girlfriend
[1:21:19] <%zetastriker> I personally hated Ori 2's sword combat
[1:21:19] <%bevyrage> combat is defense oriented, rewarding parries and staying as mobile as possible. the way you've been doing combat has been relying on the homing attack over stronger moves.
[1:21:23] <%azure22900> Combat isn't mandatory. You can get past everything or throw their projectiles back at them. The attack tree is a bit of a trap.
[1:21:24] <Herb_guy> I only say what I say from experience lol 😆
[1:21:26] <%zetastriker> Just made me compare it negatively to Hollow Knight
[1:21:26] <%BeezusHrist> @commanderclaw For sure and Lara's murdering sprees are ridiculous
[1:21:52] <GreGHWiggy> I seem to remember ground pounding my way through most of this game, basic attack is tragic
[1:21:56] <Daskolin> But MUH XP THO!
[1:22:02] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazy
[1:22:08] <%luftraumm1> game shines in the platforming/escape sequences
[1:22:18] <Zepper202> It also doesn't help that most of the time you just spam the flame attack with stomping or bashing projectiles
[1:22:21] <%heartlesshealer> XP is for unlocking QOL improvements
[1:22:23] <%luftraumm1> and exploration
[1:22:24] <@commanderclaw> @BeezusHrist I wish they'd had the courage to do *SOMETHING* with those games, they really felt super bland
[1:22:27] <Apolar_> Combat is the weakest part of Ori
[1:22:43] <FunkyStreams> Its the equivalent of Doom 2016's pistol?
[1:22:43] <%luftraumm1> yeah it takes a while for our to be beefy
[1:22:43] <Profmcstevie> The basic attack requires levels in the skill tree for power and speed
[1:22:55] <%BeezusHrist> @commanderclaw Good voice acting though. Jonah was a standout in Shadow
[1:22:57] <%heartlesshealer> if it didn't move you, it would actually add nothing to the game
[1:22:59] <OlavOlavsson> are the homing orbs the basic attack?
[1:23:09] <%PanicSwytch> @patstaresat If you hate this combat, you will really hate part 2's combat. Id rather choose the first
[1:23:15] <srkAres> i seem to remember someone else i watched use aminly the basic attack with the reckless perk or what it was
[1:23:16] <%luftraumm1> yes homing basic attack
[1:23:18] <%kindashagg> Most games make me miss that nice weighty but fast swing from Hollow Knight. As tired as the comparison is
[1:23:18] <%Xelig> @PatStaresAt have you checked out the Mortal Shell beta that is free on Epic yet? It's an interesting Dark Souls clone
[1:23:23] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazy
[1:23:27] <Zepper202> That's an interesting take on it because the bash ability is one of my favorite mechanics of any game ever
[1:23:32] <srkAres> oh wait, that was ori 2
[1:23:36] <%azure22900> Which one? They can all be thrown into spikes
[1:23:46] <Zebens> Mayeb try upgrading the skill of the attacks?
[1:23:50] <%heartlesshealer> Combat in this game is not for rush styles, yeah
[1:24:09] <%bevyrage> there is a version of the basic attack that is your character action 1-2-3 iirc
[1:24:30] <%luftraumm1> this game was pretty middle of the road for me, but the strong focus on exploration and organic progression in movement options made me stick with it
[1:24:31] <OlavOlavsson> makes you wonder why they didnt make the basic attack be a simple melee, way more engaging
[1:24:31] <Zepper202> You also don't have to fight everyone. You can just rush an objective and get out
[1:24:34] <GreGHWiggy> @PanicSwytch in what way? thought we all agreed it was much imporved haha
[1:24:34] <Profmcstevie> Just bash the enemy itself then, push them around and out of the way
[1:24:36] <%xWanderingFlame> So fun
[1:24:44] <%bevyrage> no homing, less range, but you get good damage and it sorta becomes hollow knight
[1:24:49] <%zetastriker> I upgraded my attack to near max early and never had this problem. Don't think I ever used Bash for combat
[1:25:01] <%zetastriker> Aside from required enemy types
[1:25:02] <Daskolin> But MUH XP
[1:25:08] <Zepper202> @OlavOlavsson That's literally what they did in the sequel
[1:25:10] <%heartlesshealer> Bashing the enemies also does small damage
[1:25:13] <%Retinolgaming> Pacifist run psaDab
[1:25:18] <Profmcstevie> That exp is worth piddly amounts by now
[1:25:24] <%heartlesshealer> XP is PURELY for quality of life
[1:25:26] <%xWanderingFlame> Fight everyone
[1:25:35] <%ArcanumArcanum> just get all your XP from orb secrets
[1:25:35] <%BeezusHrist> no rpg elements in metroidvanias
[1:25:35] <%azure22900> Yeah, but you can just avoid the attack tree and focus on utility.
[1:25:36] <OlavOlavsson> @Zepper202 Well at least they learnt from their mistakes LUL
[1:25:42] <StarsCrusader> Most of the XP you will ever need can be obtained from exploring
[1:25:50] <Profmcstevie> Environmental kills are generally the way to go
[1:25:53] <Zebens> LUL
[1:25:54] <%Joustar_> NotLikeThis
[1:25:57] <%BeezusHrist> Metroidvanias should be about finding new gear to make you more powerful, not fighting monsters
[1:26:27] <%DappercatEsquire> More powerful in the context of what? Traversal?
[1:26:48] <SinisterTofu> Hope you and Paige have been doing well!
[1:26:50] <stealthfart> Pat, I’m just getting to the Heavensward expansion. Why must I suffer?
[1:26:50] <%BeezusHrist> You can pretty much ignore all Monsters in Super Metroid because there is no experience
[1:26:59] <%heartlesshealer> First thing I gunned for was increased xp on the purple skill tree, then got basic attack increase, then maxed out blue for triple jump
[1:27:07] <%bevyrage> traversal and combat. think metroid and how you get new means to fight that also serve as a means to gain access to new areas
[1:27:14] <GreGHWiggy> most games easily can do both @BeezusHrist
[1:27:17] <OlavOlavsson> Only reason I do combat in metroidvanias is to grind for new skills. In metroids I just ignore the enemies if I can
[1:27:22] <Daskolin> You can ignore all monster here. Because you have 2x times xp you need in the world
[1:27:32] <%xWanderingFlame> Yeah
[1:27:55] <Shwepie> @BeezusHrist You do get more powerful from Bash and Stomp both damage upgrades over the basic attack. In the definitive edition you also get grenade in the new optional area.
[1:28:06] <%BeezusHrist> @GreGHWiggy And you do do both in Metroid, but you do not have to if you do not want to; you could just ignore most of the monsters if you wanted to
[1:28:22] <%bevyrage> bet that air dash would be helping a lot more now
[1:28:25] <Zepper202> @PatStaresAt You're bringing up a lot of fair points that people use to criticize the game and I agree with you on a lot, but the thing to keep in mind is that you're encouraged to harass enemies and kill them using the environment than charge them head on
[1:28:38] <%heartlesshealer> weak baby spirit has no melee
[1:28:46] <%azure22900> Ori 2 does, but its sucks due to visuals
[1:28:48] <+Delenay> thats your main weapon next game
[1:28:53] <Zebens> i think in Ori 2 you do habve a Mellee
[1:28:56] <%xWanderingFlame> Use your sword
[1:28:59] <%mMayrro> sorry ori is too much of a cutie fuck to wield a sword Kappa
[1:29:08] <%bevyrage> you do get a melee attack in this game too
[1:29:12] <%mMayrro> psaBlind
[1:29:14] <%heartlesshealer> frog to switch
[1:29:15] <OlavOlavsson> Dead Cells melee is the golden standard for me now, even the starting weapons feels good to hit with
[1:29:22] <%bevyrage> and it's what i used for combat as soon as i got it
[1:29:23] <Zepper202> @PatStaresAt You also get a massive fuck off hammer and a javelin in the second game
[1:29:28] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat can't look up LUL
[1:29:30] <%DappercatEsquire> should've specced into Dark spells Pat
[1:29:31] <%mMayrro> he doesn't see the lever, point and laugh

[1:32:08] <%BeezusHrist> Horizon Zero Dawn does experience really well. Leveling up does not make you any stronger, it just gives you more health so whether you're level 1 or level 50 you will have the same general experience throughout the game. You cannot become OP LUL
[1:32:09] <%bevyrage> if they moved the lever lower you wouldn't need to use the enemy to get up there. if they moved it higher you would never see it.

[1:32:29] <StarsCrusader> You went past it 3 or 4 times with no UI in the way tho
[1:32:32] <%ArcanumArcanum> @bevyrage yeah but they could've had the checkpoint UI be in a different spot on the screen

[1:36:13] <+Delenay> time for some gimmicks
[1:36:23] <@BigNaturalMan59> this game looks interesting visually but looks like a pain to play
[1:36:24] <%BeezusHrist> I miss Prince of Persia :/
[1:36:36] <%ArcanumArcanum> gravity
[1:36:38] <+Delenay> gravitity yo
[1:36:39] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy gravity orb
[1:36:44] <%worldbrand> you're sideways now
[1:36:45] <+Delenay> this ones a pain
[1:36:48] <astrophizz> walking across the curved corners rotates gravity
[1:36:48] <Zebens> Gravity zone LUL
[1:36:50] <+Laycas49> pat you are just sideways
[1:36:50] <%mMayrro> you're walking on the wall stumbo
[1:36:50] <%Ninestempest> gravity orbbbbbbb
[1:36:51] <%BeezusHrist> jump
[1:36:53] <%AmazingBlanket> @BigNaturalMan59 you are correct
[1:36:54] <StarsCrusader> Down is now left
[1:36:58] <%ArcanumArcanum> left
[1:37:00] <%heartlesshealer> You got the Magnet Boots! *da-na-na-naaaaa*
[1:37:08] <%Aztec50> turn your head
[1:37:10] <%ArcanumArcanum> it's like sonic, keep holding left
[1:37:10] <%BeezusHrist> Sideways platforming... Like Sonic space stages in Sonic 3 & knuckles
[1:37:12] <%xWanderingFlame> Kick punch
[1:37:14] <%rosemon5001> brain go poopoo
[1:37:15] <%SGrim> GRAVITY SQUEEZE
[1:37:16] <%spitelite> magnets how do they work
[1:37:20] <%jowi_time> think with portals pat!
[1:37:20] <%worldbrand> but baba IS you
[1:37:24] <+Laycas49> Pat, Pretend wall is floor.
[1:37:26] <%kindashagg> go forward
[1:37:27] <Giztech> pat is baffled by gravity
[1:37:27] <+Delenay> left is still left
[1:37:29] <Gr4ndm4rsh4ll> ....magnet boots!
[1:37:29] <%ArcanumArcanum> Just hold the direction you were holding
[1:37:32] <%xWanderingFlame> You is BABA
[1:37:33] <%Ninestempest> Pat are you tired or something
[1:37:36] <%worldbrand> tilt your head?
[1:37:36] <DiscoNinjaWolf> pat has ceased to be
[1:37:39] <OnonokiNonon> Pat, Baba is gravity
[1:37:39] <GreGHWiggy> Oh boy, Pat having real bad time
[1:37:43] <%SwdVengeance> BABA is up
[1:37:47] <%Ninestempest> ?????????
[1:37:48] <%BeezusHrist> Controls SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARDS LUL
[1:37:50] <%xWanderingFlame> play FF14 instead
[1:37:53] <%ArcanumArcanum> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[1:37:54] <%mMayrro> literally what
[1:37:56] <+Delenay> it gets worse
[1:37:57] <+Laycas49> I don't think that is right
[1:38:00] <+WarbossMetal> Left is left and right is right pat, even on walls
[1:38:00] <astrophizz> rotate your brain
[1:38:00] <%R3Roundabout> BABA IS AWOKEN
[1:38:05] <%heartlesshealer> many games do the left & right as opposed to up & down change?
[1:38:06] <Saltmeisterr> not in sonic lol
[1:38:08] <+Laycas49> yes, that is how these work
[1:38:08] <Psyramics> titl your head
[1:38:08] <%Ninestempest> That's a huge lie?
[1:38:13] <%mMayrro> that makes sense tho?
[1:38:14] <%Ninestempest> This is just Sonic rules
[1:38:16] <Profmcstevie> It's just new floor
[1:38:20] <%Ninestempest> yeah that's fine
[1:38:20] <+AugustHaze> ??????
[1:38:23] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, Ori's left
[1:38:26] <%ArcanumArcanum> because you are upside down
[1:38:26] <%xWanderingFlame> ncshappyMakesSense ncshappyMakesSense ncshappyMakesSense
[1:38:28] <spiderously> that's the gimmick Pat, it's not that hard, 8gnore the goblins
[1:38:32] <%bevyrage> when you're upside-down you gotta drop the orb
[1:38:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> but baba is you
[1:38:40] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat think of it like tank controls
[1:38:40] <Crimpson> You go left to go right
[1:38:40] <+Sadira_snack_attack> Man..I just can't anymore with Pat
[1:38:44] <mackumbopus> will you be playing the Ace Combat 7 DLC missions?
[1:38:45] <%xWanderingFlame> FF14 tomorrow?
[1:38:45] <%heartlesshealer> oh right, goblins. I forgot about the goblins
[1:38:47] <%rosemon5001> how is this an issue for you like how
[1:38:48] <%PettyFunk> This is preferable because then your fundamental controls do not shift at arbitrary moments
[1:38:50] <%bevyrage> and i'll agree on this control scheme being shitty
[1:39:05] <+WarbossMetal> Pats IQ is struggling to understand directions, and thats just kinda sad :<
[1:39:06] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, goblins will make this game not fun. Sorry Pat
[1:39:07] <Apolar_> It was pretty intuitive for me when I played it
[1:39:10] <%PanicSwytch> U don't always have to keep the ball
[1:39:12] <+Laycas49> Pat let go of the orb when you can drop to the floor
[1:39:14] <+Delenay> down. its gravity
[1:39:15] <%ArcanumArcanum> if only you could drop this gravity orb you are holding
[1:39:15] <%luftraumm1> you get used to it
[1:39:17] <Zebens> drop orb
[1:39:18] <%Ninestempest> I will not agree cause this consistency really helps with some of these puzzles
[1:39:20] <+Delenay> let go
[1:39:22] <%spitelite> are you for real
[1:39:24] <GreGHWiggy> xxxWHY
[1:39:25] <%bevyrage> DROP ORB PAT or just power through it i guess
[1:39:25] <%xWanderingFlame> But you’re BABA
[1:39:26] <%BeezusHrist> rop the orb after youve crossed the chasm
[1:39:26] <FunkyStreams> Damn, this game seems undeservingly difficult.
[1:39:28] <%Ninestempest> you have to do fancy orb drops later
[1:39:30] <%bevyrage> SPEED RUN
[1:39:30] <%BeezusHrist> LET GO OF THE ORB
[1:39:30] <%worldbrand> brute smarts
[1:39:39] <StarsCrusader> Dropping the ball is an option
[1:39:40] <%xWanderingFlame> DO COMBO
[1:39:46] <BlackfyreRoy> What up IdTheDemonofElru?
[1:39:49] <%BeezusHrist> DROP ORB
[1:39:49] <+Laycas49> drop ball pat
[1:39:50] <RoldanDgr8> This is some real darksydepat
[1:39:51] <%bevyrage> it's time to let go pat
[1:39:52] <+Laycas49> pat please
[1:39:53] <%spitelite> let go stupid
[1:39:55] <%Divryne> Drop the orb nerd.
[1:40:00] <%BeezusHrist> FIGURE OUT HOW TO DROP THE ORB @PatStaresAt
[1:40:00] <DiscoNinjaWolf> pat you have to learn to let go
[1:40:01] <%PanicSwytch> DROP THE ORB
[1:40:02] <%xxmagonx> Let go
[1:40:03] <%heartlesshealer> goblins are telling him to protect orb
[1:40:04] <%Ninestempest> oh my god
[1:40:05] <%SGrim> BABA is STUMBY
[1:40:10] <%Ninestempest> ORB CHECK
[1:40:14] <%TheStarbecue> no keep the oeb
[1:40:19] <%xxmagonx> psaBlind
[1:40:21] <+ALazo> Pat are you okay?
[1:40:32] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> he needs journalists mode
[1:40:32] <%TheStarbecue> theyre jealous of your orb
[1:40:38] <Profmcstevie> Pat might need some more coffee
[1:40:38] <spiderously> oh god, it's worse than I thought, the goblins are getting stronger
[1:40:39] <%R3Roundabout> If this game makes you miserable you might just want to switch games
[1:40:43] <+Delenay> this one is meh
[1:40:54] <+Laycas49> It's ok not to like a game
[1:41:00] <astrophizz> this was the trickiest dungeon for me
[1:41:05] <%xWanderingFlame> is it
[1:41:14] <%mMayrro> to you*
[1:41:30] <Zebens> f
[1:41:33] <spiderously> the second game is much better, because it basically Hollow Knight.
[1:41:40] <%xWanderingFlame> F
[1:41:41] <%heartlesshealer> yeah, spiders are annoying
[1:41:42] <%bevyrage> the part you died at before last is where you have to learn the tech or make no progress
[1:41:42] <%PanicSwytch> Switch games if u must Pat
[1:41:42] <StarsCrusader> You're like 8 hours in and still not spamming save as much as you can
[1:41:43] <+Laycas49> this is the baby part of the game so if you're out now I dunno if you're gonna like the rest
[1:41:45] <mackumbopus> local non-adaptive streamer refuses to let go.
[1:41:49] <%rosemon5001> would you really prefer random control style switching really?
[1:42:01] <%Fooguwu> is patrick being a badtrick
[1:42:24] <+Delenay> its kinda meh that we are here trying to raise his low opinions of this game by saying it gets better. =/
[1:42:26] <%BallerSwagBro9k> boomer cant git gud LUL
[1:42:36] <%BeezusHrist> It's ok @PatStaresAt , we're here to support you LUL
[1:42:37] <%bevyrage> @rosemon5001 if the camera rotated with then it wouldn't be a problem. it's the issue of the controls being based on ori's orientation and not your viewer perspective
[1:42:46] <xWanderingFlame> PridePaint PrideWorld
[1:42:47] <+Delenay> i mean.. it does but it sucks
[1:42:58] <%TheStarbecue> im just a dad on the internet having a great time
[1:43:03] <%BeezusHrist> save
[1:43:03] <StarsCrusader> SAVE
[1:43:04] <Apolar_> saaaaave
[1:43:06] <%heartlesshealer> no he wouldn't, but goblins. I think what Pat wants is automatic camera rotation to follow Ori's orientation
[1:43:12] <%xxmagonx> Save!
[1:43:17] <+Laycas49> It controls fine pat, you are being a baby
[1:43:19] <+Delenay> and now it gets bad
[1:43:31] <astrophizz> now's the hard part
[1:43:33] <a_mad_dragon> just turn your TV sideways 4Head
[1:43:35] <%worldbrand> i dunno this feels a little like the conversation about tank controls but in reverse
[1:43:35] <%luftraumm1> it gets harder
[1:43:37] <%bevyrage> pat please just drop down
[1:43:39] <spiderously> just switch to Will of the Wisps and watch a summary video for this one
[1:43:43] <%xxmagonx> Let go
[1:43:44] <%heartlesshealer> Almost
[1:43:45] <%BeezusHrist> @PatStaresAt Never played Sonic 3 & Knuckles LUL ?
[1:43:46] <mackumbopus> open your 8th chakra pat.

[1:44:15] <mackumbopus> ever played gravity guy?
[1:44:16] <+WarbossMetal> Maybe its time for Pat to hand in his gamer badge
[1:44:21] <+Laycas49> That's fire

[1:44:45] <%xWanderingFlame> Ever played Gravity Rush?
[1:44:48] <%luftraumm1> I had lots of trouble here, but it requires a bit of patience and on the fly puzzle solving
[1:44:52] <%worldbrand> i think you can walk safely on the squares
[1:44:53] <StarsCrusader> Please
[1:44:55] <Crimpson> Sling shot
[1:44:57] <%AncelDeLambert> this is a stumbo puzzle for lots of people
[1:44:58] <%xWanderingFlame> psaBlind
[1:44:58] <astrophizz> do a gravity rush
[1:45:02] <%heartlesshealer> walk around orange cube
[1:45:07] <%bevyrage> squares need orb
[1:45:09] <%heartlesshealer> no jump
[1:45:15] <mackumbopus> BABA IS NOT GRAVITY
[1:45:15] <%mMayrro> pain :)
[1:45:16] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat walking on lava with the orb is what changes gravity
[1:45:17] <+Delenay> jump onto the rock. then walk around the rock and jump off in the other direction
[1:45:19] <%xWanderingFlame> @astrophizz psaUp
[1:45:24] <%heartlesshealer> I might be wrong
[1:45:33] <spiderously> apparently I'm a prodigy (I'm not, I'm pretty dumb) because I love this dungeon, and I can finish it in minutes, it's probably your goblins.
[1:45:36] <astrophizz> walk to the other side of the cube
[1:45:39] <%xWanderingFlame> BABA IS GRAVITY
[1:45:39] <%BeezusHrist> Damn, I want Chipotle, but I made chile the other day and I gotta eat that... ugh
[1:45:43] <%PanicSwytch> Think of these squares like a planet with gravity
[1:45:50] <Apolar_> Baba is gravity
[1:45:53] <%Ninestempest> I think I had issues with figuring out the puzzles here, not really executing them though
[1:45:56] <+WarbossMetal> Gravity 2 hard 4 Pat
[1:46:01] <%Ninestempest> but it's a very puzzle heavy level
[1:46:08] <%heartlesshealer> I haven't gotten to this one yet, but brain tells me walk around cube like a yoshi's island raven boss fight, and then drop off to fall left
[1:46:11] <mackumbopus> imagine like your playing the Outer Wilds
[1:46:19] <%xWanderingFlame> Physics are great
[1:46:25] <RoldanDgr8> NotLikeThis
[1:46:31] <%BeezusHrist> I'm an expert at platformers, I beat Super Mario World on the gameboy LUL
[1:46:33] <+Delenay> walk around. its a circle
[1:46:34] <%BallerSwagBro9k> HOW CAN THIZ BE?
[1:46:35] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[1:46:38] <%spitelite> just walk dont jump
[1:46:41] <%mMayrro> please
[1:46:41] <%azure22900> Walk
[1:46:42] <+Delenay> you are tied to it now
[1:46:43] <%ArcanumArcanum> walking on lava with the orb is what changes gravity. you are standing on a lava block. put 2 and 2 together
[1:46:43] <%bevyrage> rounded corners
[1:46:43] <%PanicSwytch> WALK AROUND
[1:46:45] <%heartlesshealer> CLAP
[1:46:49] <%worldbrand> am i nuts? you can infer this from level design right?
[1:46:49] <%bevyrage> now jump
[1:46:51] <%PettyFunk> So while holding orb, gravity is always down for Ori, not for the viewer
[1:46:53] <Zebens> LUL
[1:46:55] <%swesterly> Hiya Pat, you feeling hype for Deadly Premonition 2?
[1:46:56] <%azure22900> Jump
[1:47:01] <%PanicSwytch> BUT BABA
[1:47:08] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat it's a puzzle
[1:47:11] <%Ninestempest> YEAH
[1:47:14] <%bevyrage> remember you can bail on gravity by letting go
[1:47:15] <%worldbrand> dont give up, skeleton!
[1:47:20] <%ArcanumArcanum> please stop trying to brute smarts it
[1:47:23] <%heartlesshealer> enjoy the Paige feelings, Pat
[1:47:37] <%Divryne> PHYSICS.
[1:47:40] <+Laycas49> Pat, apply what you just learned
[1:47:47] <+Laycas49> go around second cube and jump from bottom again
[1:47:47] <%spitelite> apply what you learned
[1:47:52] <%azure22900> Pat just do the easy way please.
[1:47:55] <%Metballs> Paige, give the controller to Pat
[1:47:55] <%mMayrro> this is the part where all the vod people put it at x2 psaWhat
[1:47:56] <%heartlesshealer> No rushing
[1:48:03] <%PettyFunk> Orange boxes let you change which way is down
[1:48:04] <+Laycas49> because that is what is happening
[1:48:04] <%doc_ock_rokc> thats exactly what is happening
[1:48:07] <CMash2k> isnt that life in general tho
[1:48:09] <Giztech> use the square the whole way
[1:48:10] <%Divryne> Pat the solution to the puzzle is on your TV monitor.
[1:48:10] <%BallerSwagBro9k> YES PAT
[1:48:11] <+Delenay> theres a key frag below your save, turn left with the orb first!
[1:48:12] <%Joustar_> NotLikeThis
[1:48:13] <Apolar_> saaave
[1:48:15] <%ArcanumArcanum> You are trying to mash a square block into a round hole. The way you think they work isn't how they work
[1:48:18] <+Laycas49> go back to lower cube
[1:48:23] <+walternatorz> conform
[1:48:24] <RoldanDgr8> Paige playing baba is you was less frustrating
[1:48:28] <%azure22900> Get save juice
[1:48:29] <%bevyrage> drop to right, walk around, then drop up
[1:48:31] <%Ninestempest> this dungeon is a new concept entirely lol, how can you have pre-conceived notions on how it works
[1:48:31] <%heartlesshealer> you picked up orb when you wanted to shoot blue crystal for save???????
[1:48:33] <+ALazo> You already know the solution to the puzzle. You have to apply it more than once, though.
[1:48:34] <astrophizz> "drop" from the earlier cube
[1:48:40] <spiderously> this is painful to watch
[1:48:41] <+Laycas49> HES SO CLOSE
[1:48:43] <%PanicSwytch> POSITIONING AND GRAVITY AFFECTS YOUR MOVEMENT
[1:48:48] <%spitelite> are you for real
[1:48:48] <ahmz1404> part of the fun is watching him try to figure it out
[1:48:49] <%bevyrage> DROP UP STUPID
[1:48:52] <%Metballs> Pat, you literally solved it on teh last cube
[1:48:54] <%ArcanumArcanum> But BABA. How can this BEEEE
[1:48:56] <%PettyFunk> Yeah!
[1:48:57] <%xxmagonx> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[1:48:58] <%heartlesshealer> YOU DID IT PAIGE
[1:49:02] <+Laycas49> ladies and gentlemen he did it
[1:49:04] <spiderously> DROP UP
[1:49:06] <%TheActuallyGuy> 492? Guess Pat wasn't the only person not interested in Ori.
[1:49:16] <%PanicSwytch> YOU DID IT
[1:49:20] <astrophizz> hehe one key piece is back at the start
[1:49:21] <%PettyFunk> We went up boys!
[1:49:44] <$joylent_blue> WOO
[1:49:49] <%bevyrage> you can open up the spirit gate now though right?
[1:49:58] <mackumbopus> ORI IS WIN
[1:49:58] <%azure22900> Should probably get the map for the area too
[1:50:03] <%Ninestempest> no
[1:50:06] <%Ninestempest> he needs the 4 pieces
[1:50:09] <%heartlesshealer> save well heals you
[1:50:11] <%Ninestempest> he has 1
[1:50:14] <%bevyrage> ah
[1:50:20] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat look at your map and see where the keys are
[1:50:20] <%worldbrand> he's only got one, he missed one at the bottom there
[1:50:36] <%SinisterBroccoli> Don't let the tilt win, literally.
[1:50:45] <@BigNaturalMan59> i thought about buying this several times, im kinda glad i didnt
[1:50:55] <Shwepie> @TheActuallyGuy Might more be his reaction to it than the game itself. He seems pretty miserable.
[1:51:02] <+Delenay> pats gunna be mad when he gets the top one but missed the bottom key at the start of this room
[1:51:02] <%heartlesshealer> almost
[1:51:09] <%ArcanumArcanum> flawless timing
[1:51:09] <Apolar_> LUL
[1:51:10] <+Laycas49> just timing
[1:51:11] <Zebens> LUL
[1:51:12] <%rosemon5001> i was mostly in the vod land but he never upgraded the attack huh
[1:51:15] <akaoridux> lol...
[1:51:15] <mackumbopus> gamestop journalist mode
[1:51:19] <%Midashu> Well at least this isn't TLoU2
[1:51:24] <%Metballs> Stop trying to speedrun it, Pat
[1:51:25] <Apolar_> I, for one, enjoy pat's suffering
[1:51:29] <%bevyrage> yeah he hasn't upgraded basic attack
[1:51:32] <%heartlesshealer> pat got the earlier one near the first cubes
[1:51:40] <KingVantq> really?
[1:51:43] <+Laycas49> I think Pat enjoys his suffering too a little bit
[1:51:47] <%Joustar_> Famous last words: "ok"
[1:51:49] <%Ninestempest> wait what has pat been upgrading then???
[1:51:51] <%BallerSwagBro9k> The worst its ever been NotLikeThis
[1:52:05] <%SinisterBroccoli> skill tree
[1:52:10] <Herb_guy> This is gamer pain poor Patt
[1:52:12] <%ssjklyco> Pat and the Blind Chat
[1:52:17] <%SinisterBroccoli> save point
[1:52:20] <+Delenay> b on save point
[1:52:25] <%bevyrage> skill try at save points
[1:52:26] <KingVantq> ^^^
[1:52:30] <%Ninestempest> gotta do save
[1:52:32] <%heartlesshealer> need save light to see the skill trees, but yeah, pat upgraded basic attack. Problem was that he gunned for attack up First
[1:52:35] <%ArcanumArcanum> Look at the red branch
[1:52:44] <%heartlesshealer> TWO UPGRADES FROM XP INCREASE
[1:52:48] <%ArcanumArcanum> if you hate the basic attack, focus on making it better
[1:52:50] <%heartlesshealer> FUCK
[1:52:51] <Herb_guy> At least this isn't Resident Evil 6
[1:52:57] <%heartlesshealer> purple
[1:52:57] <%PettyFunk> He's been alternating trees each time I think?
[1:53:02] <StarsCrusader> 2 oe 3 of those upgrades are for the explosion tho
[1:53:03] <%SinisterBroccoli> you're not wrong the basic attack is really weird and clunky
[1:53:22] <%ArcanumArcanum> levelling all trees equally is a terrible way to do it
[1:53:28] <narusao> urge to kill . . . rising
[1:53:32] <astrophizz> I'm cool with the basic attack in this but I think the attacks in 2 are better
[1:53:33] <%bevyrage> it is
[1:53:34] <%Ninestempest> i wouldn't call it clunky, it'd call it loose and having like no impamct at all
[1:53:34] <%rosemon5001> i see whats the issue not going for every secret
[1:53:41] <%bevyrage> btw you can heal at the save pool
[1:53:45] <%Ninestempest> which really adds to it feeling poopy

[1:53:48] <%bevyrage> no need to SD on it
[1:53:49] <KingVantq> just got here when did he get to this part?
[1:53:53] <+Delenay> im a coward and played on easy
[1:53:54] <%DappercatEsquire> You think there's going to be some dumbass frustrating shit in DP2? This might just be practice, Pat.
[1:53:55] <%SinisterBroccoli> I always get the basic upgrade then everything up to exp gain
[1:54:10] <%SinisterBroccoli> then middle and left tree till theyre done
[1:54:12] <%PettyFunk> Yeah, 2 drastically improved the combat. Devs insisted they weren't taking influence from Hollow Knight, but hey, if they were it might not be a bad thing
[1:54:12] <%heartlesshealer> no, pat's been getting the secrets when he can figure them out, but all that battle xp is half of what people usually get by now

[1:56:30] <%heartlesshealer> that's just a for fun corner
[1:56:31] <%SinisterBroccoli> the orange hot floor should have been more orange
[1:56:38] <%heartlesshealer> if you needed save energy
[1:56:46] <penitentpentwitch> Oof, be glad it's not the original version of the game, the orange floor one shots you there
[1:56:52] <Zebens> Level Pog
[1:57:04] <%bevyrage> need key
[1:57:08] <%Zombrocom> They really went ham on the blue and orange for this game huh

[1:57:15] <+Delenay> down
[1:57:18] <%heartlesshealer> oooh, that one
[1:57:40] <%heartlesshealer> pat
[1:57:47] <%ArcanumArcanum> If only there was a way to change gravity
[1:57:48] <%SinisterBroccoli> The main thing with the basic attack being pretty weak is that you are kinda meant to try and shoot people off cliffs or shoot their attacks at each other a lot
[1:57:48] <%WhereIsWill> oh fuck all this D:
[1:57:54] <%bevyrage> oh yeah, inverted platforming key

[2:01:30] <StarsCrusader> HOW
[2:01:31] <%Zombrocom> I think pat had an easier time with that path of pain thing
[2:01:32] <akaoridux> hes losing it monkaS
[2:01:32] <%PettyFunk> I feel like he performs better if Paige is actively ridiculing him for making mistakes
[2:01:34] <%BeezusHrist> Paige will keep him SANE
[2:01:38] <%DensityD> losing his mid

[2:01:48] <$insaneintentionsyo> or reeeeee
[2:01:48] <%DappercatEsquire> The laughing is psaBig Pat energy
[2:01:50] <%heartlesshealer> He does, actually, @PettyFunk
[2:02:00] <penitentpentwitch> You have more tool is Path of Pain
[2:02:01] <BluBox> I agree
[2:02:01] <%DensityD> hug the wall
[2:02:02] <$joylent_blue> he's full hollow
[2:02:05] <%Metballs> This is fair, just stop rushing it
[2:02:09] <%WhereIsWill> path of pain was dope
[2:02:11] <$insaneintentionsyo> I prefered Wisp's gameplay

[2:02:29] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat, just boot up Runeterra
[2:02:29] <penitentpentwitch> Make a new save and regen an HP
[2:02:31] <%azure22900> Path of pain is hell of a lot harder than this.
[2:02:32] <narusao> FailFish
[2:02:32] <%spitelite> take you time
[2:02:33] <DiscoNinjaWolf> why do you even keep doing that
[2:02:34] <akaoridux> ori and the blind anger
[2:02:35] <%luftraumm1> this once is more spatial comprehension than path of pain wich is more execution
[2:02:36] <%BeezusHrist> Paige, get yo mans!!
[2:02:37] <%vaporousTippler> Now is the part on Sprockets where we CRY.
[2:02:37] <%rosemon5001> this is literally easier if you want to use your brain
[2:02:40] <Shwepie> Is Pat going to break?
[2:02:40] <mackumbopus> imagine if hollow knight had tbese gravity mechanics
[2:02:41] <%WhereIsWill> sanity DESTOYEED
[2:02:42] <%BeezusHrist> He's going NUTZ
[2:02:42] <%Ninestempest> just go up to the full helath save first
[2:02:49] <Apolar_> Do you wanna know how I got these scars? You see, I was playing ori...
[2:02:49] <%SinisterBroccoli> Well with path of pain you're insentivised to go fast, and you kinda gotta go slow here, which sucks.
[2:02:54] <%heartlesshealer> For real either slow down or find Elmo to calm down
[2:02:54] <%Ninestempest> stop trying to one cycle everything lmao
[2:02:56] <penitentpentwitch> Is this Pat's Shadow Puzzle moment?
[2:02:58] <%Bailey__gaming> is paige even here? :)
[2:02:59] <BluBox> :D
[2:03:00] <ahmz1404> you did path of pain in like 10 minutes
[2:03:03] <+walternatorz> @PatStaresAt just remember, watching train wrecks is still entertaining
[2:03:06] <%luftraumm1> he's now away that moment you want to do it or of spite
[2:03:06] <$joylent_blue> this is the day pat finally shits his pants
[2:03:11] <+WarbossMetal> Breaking news just in: Pat is bad at platformers!
[2:03:19] <%heartlesshealer> fast = bad
[2:03:21] <%PanicSwytch> Of all the games that can break Pat why is it this one
[2:03:21] <%TheActuallyGuy> I'm anticipating a short stream today.
[2:03:30] <Apolar_> saaave
[2:03:32] <BluBox> God gamer Pat is NOT
[2:03:32] <+wibbwobbler> im crying
[2:03:34] <Saltmeisterr> are u guys ready for the silksong equivalent of PoP?
[2:03:35] <%Bailey__gaming> do i need to do a Platform Puzzles read? :P
[2:03:37] <%heartlesshealer> LEFT
[2:03:37] <%luftraumm1> waiting feels like a punishment
[2:03:40] <%heartlesshealer> NO
[2:03:41] <%Zombrocom> I mean, he beat hollow knight, which is harder than this
[2:03:45] <%heartlesshealer> fine
[2:03:46] <+Delenay> respawning with low hp does suck. but there are talents for that on the green tree
[2:03:48] <%vaporousTippler> "Hey, guys! Surprise FFXIV stream today!"
[2:03:53] <%SinisterBroccoli> LMAO
[2:03:54] <$insaneintentionsyo> GUMO
[2:03:55] <Profmcstevie> God I hope silksong has gravity mechanics just for you Pat
[2:03:55] <%BallerSwagBro9k> DIG UP
[2:03:57] <%heartlesshealer> Map tho =)
[2:03:57] <akaoridux> LET ME IN

[2:04:06] <%heartlesshealer> BYE MAP
[2:04:06] <%Ninestempest> LMAOOO
[2:04:17] <%rufus2k2> DOOR STUCK
[2:04:18] <%AncelDeLambert> just think, Pat, you're halfway through
[2:04:18] <%azure22900> This game is a lot easier when you are not trying to make unintended shortcuts.
[2:04:23] <%SinisterBroccoli> I love how it's so bright you can't tell what ori is doing
[2:04:25] <Shwepie> @SinisterBroccoli You can go fast here too. Orb is only actually needed to change gravity in a few spots and most of the tricky platform can be skipped by not carrying the orb as it will just follow you.
[2:04:25] <%BeezusHrist> chile time
[2:04:28] <megaman_sentinel> the map lol
[2:04:45] <+Delenay> this dungeon sucks
[2:04:46] <%SinisterBroccoli> Shwepie Oh I know, but going fast is killing pat
[2:04:58] <%SinisterBroccoli> Shwepie I've played the game like 3 times
[2:05:01] <%PettyFunk> Kinda reminds me of the dead stags in Hollow Knight
[2:05:09] <%heartlesshealer> 👏
[2:05:10] <+Delenay> ones for outside
[2:05:21] <%heartlesshealer> kill spider and upgrade
[2:05:23] <penitentpentwitch> Have to save after every major moment, or else it resets
[2:05:28] <penitentpentwitch> Save here

[2:08:02] <%azure22900> Pats gonna get stuck here.
[2:08:02] <penitentpentwitch> You have to go back down and to the left after you trigger the ceiling in that room
[2:08:02] <%SinisterBroccoli> The story is kinda unclear
[2:08:08] <Apolar_> SourPls
[2:08:11] <%bevyrage> yeah a rollercoaster sequence but the cart is off rails

[2:08:17] <%AngriestAngryArtist> AngriestAngryArtist subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 15 months! 
[2:08:22] <%SinisterBroccoli> just shoot the blast at the wall
[2:08:23] <%bevyrage> just deflect the projectile into the wall?
[2:08:34] <+Delenay> There is a bullshit nook on the left of that tall climb where the rocks fall on your head, beyond the bounce wall
[2:08:38] <%PettyFunk> This forest still has eyes, and Ori needs to blind them.
[2:08:49] <+Delenay> go left
[2:08:57] <KingVantq> down
[2:08:59] <%SinisterBroccoli> gotta go down
[2:09:01] <penitentpentwitch> It broke the floor
[2:09:02] <%bevyrage> you go down where the bridge breaks

[2:09:10] <%azure22900> Go up bait rocks then down the hole they make
[2:09:11] <+Delenay> up then lft then down. its bs
[2:09:12] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[2:09:19] <%heartlesshealer> rocks crush floor > hole now in floor > passage?
[2:09:24] <%Ninestempest> it's super clear what i did understood that par tthe one time the rocks fell
[2:09:30] <+wibbwobbler> boulders open a new path
[2:09:32] <%Ninestempest> as is chat clearly just now
[2:09:34] <Apolar_> Pat hitting literally everything in his path LUL
[2:09:35] <%bevyrage> i think pat needs to take a break from this because he's forgetting stuff he's learned minutes prior
[2:09:37] <$insaneintentionsyo> these escape sequences from the first game insane120Ree
[2:09:44] <KingVantq> LUL
[2:09:47] <madskull456> this forest really wants to splat and maim ori jeez
[2:09:49] <+Delenay> bs run
[2:09:55] <+Delenay> followed by another bs run
[2:09:57] <%SinisterBroccoli> Last Ori stream yay!
[2:10:15] <$insaneintentionsyo> it's okay, I remember struggling like three years ago
[2:10:28] <+Delenay> This game is "Do it perfect first time" its annoying at times
[2:10:30] <%bevyrage> okay that one was bullshit 'cause it blended into the background
[2:10:34] <%Daxalog> There is no secret achievement for hitting the falling spikes
[2:10:40] <$joylent_blue> that seemed hard to see
[2:10:44] <%SinisterBroccoli> At least the music's good :D
[2:10:44] <%doc_ock_rokc> Ori and the blind rage
[2:10:44] <Profmcstevie> Slow and steady finishes games
[2:10:45] <penitentpentwitch> I did a no death run of this for the achievement, hated this one in particular
[2:11:24] <%SinisterBroccoli> Doesn't help he went into this with such low health
[2:11:29] <+wibbwobbler> feels annoying cuz its almost impossible to not die on first run
[2:11:39] <%DensityD> LEARN
[2:11:39] <%heartlesshealer> event flag fall

[2:11:44] <%bevyrage> "low health"
[2:11:45] <+Ketronox> this shit looks awful. Am I just too high to appreciate what's happening?
[2:11:46] <%SinisterBroccoli> Pat's ghost is leaving his body
[2:11:46] <$joylent_blue> ok THAT'S bullshit
[2:11:47] <%Ninestempest> lul

[2:12:05] <%heartlesshealer> yeah
[2:12:08] <madskull456> yeah id smash this forest too if i was Ori
[2:12:11] <%Ninestempest> it defintiely feels very trial and error compared to the first tree
[2:12:14] <$insaneintentionsyo> will a game make pat cry?
[2:12:16] <%azure22900> Biggest problem with these run sequences its all trial and error.
[2:12:24] <%fifty_seven> fifty_seven subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 13 months! 
[2:12:37] <%heartlesshealer> for no death, kiiinda has to be second run through
[2:12:37] <$Dakuu75> imagine how ruined the moment would be if there was a big dumb arrow pointing where you're suppose to go though
[2:12:47] <%heartlesshealer> ability points
[2:12:48] <penitentpentwitch> And now your reward, Lore!
[2:12:49] <KingVantq> not even that long just hazards up the ass

[2:14:27] <penitentpentwitch> So for general reference, if your distress flare you use to search for you child microwaves other people's kids. Maybe don't use it.
[2:14:30] <$Dakuu75> yep... those kids literally burned to death
[2:14:30] <%JJCheeker> They look so cute though
[2:14:33] <%BeezusHrist> FUCK DEM KIDS
[2:14:34] <%heartlesshealer> so the tree stole life energy to call out for Ori
[2:14:34] <%ssjklyco> Did the bird have an orgasm?

[2:15:00] <%michingmallecho> Sad owl hasL
[2:15:01] <+Delenay> light creature dark creature?
[2:15:02] <Zebens> Light evapoarates darkness
[2:15:02] <%SinisterBroccoli> I have no idea
[2:15:04] <penitentpentwitch> Microwave light is strong
[2:15:04] <Apolar_> So Kuro was justified and the forest needs to die
[2:15:05] <%UvBenServed> Birb Revengeance
[2:15:07] <%PanicSwytch> LIGHT IS EVIL DARKNESS IS GOOD
[2:15:07] <+wibbwobbler> fuck that blind fucking bitch forest
[2:15:08] <Psyramics> they're creatures of dark?
[2:15:08] <vVAstrAVv> cus light kills baby birds pat lol
[2:15:08] <%Ninestempest> cause they're dark and the tree is light
[2:15:10] <%BeezusHrist> FUCK DEM KIDS
[2:15:11] <$Dakuu75> baby-birds, their darkness was weak. they needed more light-tolerance like their mom
[2:15:12] <%SinisterBroccoli> Story is vague
[2:15:12] <+Delenay> no real answer
[2:15:14] <madskull456> so ori did kill them?
[2:15:15] <%rosemon5001> @PatStaresAt tree has death field skill
[2:15:17] <%michingmallecho> Time to kill some trees
[2:15:17] <%DappercatEsquire> THE LAST OF US 2, BUT BIRDS

[2:16:20] <%ArcanumArcanum> can Pat figure out how to use a mechanic he's had for hours
[2:16:22] <Ryouseiteki> I'm guessing it's a spirit/elemental thing? birbs are simply darkness elementals vs ori/tree's light?
[2:16:23] <%heartlesshealer> spider shoots things
[2:16:23] <%bevyrage> you gotta use the blue pulse for the wood
[2:16:23] <penitentpentwitch> You have to slingshot the spider's shot into the smoking tree bit
[2:16:26] <%NeedlesD> NeedlesD subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 11 months!

[2:16:51] <+zestyArsenic> is this the dark souls of ori games
[2:16:53] <%Ninestempest> gotta go into the log lol

[2:17:57] <%bevyrage> if you do the bounce when he's just before the ledge the arc is perfect to hit the wall
[2:18:08] <KingVantq> last ori stream NotLikeThis

[2:18:09] <%heartlesshealer> pat is fully checked out
[2:18:13] <%ArcanumArcanum> It's almost like you're expected to have used Bash ever since you got it, but Pat's adamant refusal to use it has made him bad at using it

[2:20:40] <%heartlesshealer> PUZZLE TEMPLES ARE FINAL
[2:20:41] <Shwepie> She's not protecting, she's revenging.
[2:20:42] <musti_jaja_> @lophostrix_ worst is over, it'll pick back up
[2:20:42] <%bevyrage> but not right now
[2:20:43] <penitentpentwitch> Oh she's protecting her kid, lets ignore that and keep resurrecting the thing that microwaved them
[2:20:44] <Zebens> explosion
[2:20:44] <%ArcanumArcanum> but if Ori fails then the forest dies and there's no food for the baby so the baby dies
[2:20:47] <$Dakuu75> Yeah, jsut let Abby win. Ellie and Joel were the true bad-guys, all along~
[2:20:49] <%heartlesshealer> FOREVER 99%
[2:21:00] <%BeezusHrist> She needs to ask herself why the light is harming her chillren
[2:21:09] <%PettyFunk> Pat the owl is the cycle of revenge :(
[2:21:12] <vVAstrAVv> look if youre a dark spirit maybe dont have your babies in the forest of light god

[2:21:19] <Zebens> Level a skill point
[2:21:19] <%heartlesshealer> wow pat
[2:21:19] <Apolar_> This seems like a very hostile and unpleasant forest, maybe Kuro should win
[2:21:23] <Zebens> PogChamp
[2:21:25] <%heartlesshealer> you didn't even read the upgrade
[2:21:30] <%BeezusHrist> @PettyFunk This is.. the last of us
[2:21:32] <%heartlesshealer> and picked attack tree
[2:21:45] <AtrusHB> chat is subverting my expectations
[2:21:55] <Zebens> LUL
[2:21:56] <%heartlesshealer> probably final ori stream
[2:22:02] <%Ninestempest> LUL
[2:22:04] <%BeezusHrist> Yeah, this forest kind of sucks. Maybe Kuro should win LUL @Apolar_ @PatStaresAt
[2:22:11] <musti_jaja_> !uptime
[2:22:12] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 2h 22m.
[2:22:21] <%bevyrage> final ori stream depending on if he gets stuck hard or not
[2:22:22] <+Delenay> you dont have that ability till fire
[2:22:31] <usurper_sos> LUL
[2:22:35] <+wibbwobbler> love that little critter's naruto run
[2:22:41] <%Gallhint> Wow this is the biggest he's been tilt in some time
[2:22:46] <musti_jaja_> last area is decently lengthy
[2:23:18] <GreGHWiggy> only took 2 hours for Pat to hate this game with every fibre of his being
[2:23:27] <%bevyrage> it wasn't an increase you just went back to a lower 'difficulty' zone
[2:23:32] <%heartlesshealer> equal tree distribution is a miserable way to upgrade in this game, but pat commits
[2:23:32] <musti_jaja_> @greghwiggy LUL
[2:23:38] <%bevyrage> enemies have less health here than the last one you were in
[2:23:42] <penitentpentwitch> You get an ability later for it
[2:23:44] <vVAstrAVv> no it only took not being hollow knight
[2:23:46] <%BeezusHrist> @GreGHWiggy He's been playing iot for multiple streams
[2:23:47] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkSmile bawkKek
[2:23:51] <Lophostrix_> my memory of this game got completely erased by the second one, no idea what comes next
[2:23:53] <%PettyFunk> Can't wait for Ori and the Tilt of the Wisps
[2:23:53] <+WarbossMetal> Timestop may be required~
[2:23:59] <T_Sasquatch> LUL i stopped playing this game years ago too because its unironically hard
[2:24:15] <musti_jaja_> @beezushrist has he hated it the whole time?
[2:24:32] <%BeezusHrist> DEATH STRANDING PC is going to be Lit. Beat Death SDtanding PC in 3 days @PatStaresAt ??
[2:24:34] <%Metballs> Only really this stream
[2:24:37] <%heartlesshealer> he hated it since wind temple started
[2:24:46] <%BeezusHrist> @musti_jaja_ He's been indifferent, but now he hates it LUL
[2:24:53] <%arcielardor> @patstaresat Just got in. You beat it yet?
[2:24:55] <%heartlesshealer> before wind temple he was just annoyed
[2:24:58] <musti_jaja_> yep, second area is a SHARP drop in quality
[2:25:06] <+wibbwobbler> hard=good every time
[2:25:08] <$insaneintentionsyo> it's the platforming
[2:25:08] <+QuesoFM> LOL
[2:25:11] <%Joustar_> From good feelings to the return of AngriestPat
[2:25:12] <%WhereIsWill> oh nooo LUL
[2:25:13] <%pectusumbra> oooof.
[2:25:13] <$Dakuu75> well, ppl are allowed to like and hate what they do
[2:25:14] <+Delenay> that dunegon sucks
[2:25:15] <musti_jaja_> those gravity puzzles are awful
[2:25:16] <$insaneintentionsyo> sequel is better
[2:25:17] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:25:17] <penitentpentwitch> Understandable, the wind dungeon is very 'instadeath' into a kaizo run
[2:25:22] <+Luke_Sky_Larker> get good
[2:25:23] <%JJCheeker> Plus your hair is a little crazier
[2:25:25] <+Delenay> pretty sure fire one sucks too
[2:25:27] <Lophostrix_> hope he's not put off the second one, it's much better than this
[2:25:28] <%ssjklyco> Back to spite playing Last of Us 2 for you
[2:25:29] <%AngriestAngryArtist> doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ doodJJ
[2:25:29] <+Delenay> but it wasnt as bad
[2:25:32] <%BallerSwagBro9k> you're just bad LUL
[2:25:36] <%heartlesshealer> goblins hindered him on the platforming gimmick of the wind temple

[2:26:01] <%ArcanumArcanum> Don't worry the next temple will fix that for you
[2:26:03] <%heartlesshealer> just happened to be orange
[2:26:06] <penitentpentwitch> Success regardless!
[2:26:06] <Drusain> Nah AngriestPat would've figured it out by now
[2:26:08] <+Delenay> it was just heat. you havent hit the lava bs yet
[2:26:08] <penitentpentwitch> Save
[2:26:12] <NoireRequiem> mildly infuriated Pat?
[2:26:14] <+QuesoFM> abandon ship and play ff14
[2:26:17] <%PsycoZaku> PsycoZaku subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! a billion dollars
[2:26:17] <musti_jaja_> @delenay fire one picked back up from the wind temple but it never reached the first areas heights
[2:26:19] <astrophizz> the actual fire temple is wild
[2:26:23] <%YakumoYomi> Thanks for the PrideShrug @psycozaku
[2:26:24] <%Ninestempest> it's a combination of the game slowing down drastically for puzzles which doesn't feel good in a game that is very fast and free flowing, as well as the escape sequence being VERY trial and error
[2:26:28] <Landedx> its a way to do it
[2:26:30] <%SirGO0SE> Excuse me?!
[2:26:33] <KingVantq> this part
[2:26:40] <RoldanDgr8> Save
[2:26:44] <penitentpentwitch> Save before you die and have to fly up!

[2:27:24] <%YakumoYomi> Butthurt Junction, adjacent to Horsefuck Valley
[2:27:24] <%PanicSwytch> I think its time to change games
[2:27:31] <musti_jaja_> pat's annoyed at
[2:27:31] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Embrace your anger!
[2:27:32] <Lophostrix_> oh, i remember this part, it sucks
[2:27:32] <+Ketronox> Pat Angers At
[2:27:34] <Mister_McDerp> angriestpat is back!
[2:27:36] <%kindashagg> Anger Street fucking hates Carefree Highway
[2:27:52] <usurper_sos> he HATES it
[2:27:54] <%ArcanumArcanum> You can also just use Bash to chuck enemies into spikes to kill them instantly
[2:27:57] <%BeezusHrist> PJSALT
[2:27:57] <+TheNewZealandStory> why does this game seem more concerned with garish lisa frank art than with making sure things are easily readable
[2:27:58] <%Ninestempest> it does what the projectile does lol
[2:28:00] <mackumbopus> Ori and the Shitting on the Bed Forest
[2:28:01] <+CptBritches> Good good, let the hate flow through you
[2:28:04] <%WhereIsWill> git gud scrub psaDab
[2:28:04] <%Ninestempest> if the projectile does more, it'll do more
[2:28:05] <nivlac_555> St. Angriest Pat
[2:28:05] <%BeezusHrist> PJSalt
[2:28:05] <%SvenHolgersson> We in the Endname now boiz?
[2:28:06] <Mister_McDerp> he HATES it :(
[2:28:08] <%SvenHolgersson> Or not quite
[2:28:09] <musti_jaja_> games' combat is super limited and just not good yeah
[2:28:12] <@PlagueOfGripes> is this a good game or an annoying game that's good
[2:28:13] <vVAstrAVv> sounds like BETCH to me
[2:28:21] <%rosemon5001> waaah cant spam waah psaGoblin psaDab
[2:28:24] <$Dakuu75> yeah a lot of this game becomes "Do I need this enemy to progress?"
[2:28:24] <%heartlesshealer> from elsewhere
[2:28:29] <$insaneintentionsyo> it's a good game
[2:28:33] <%heartlesshealer> it's a good game, but goblins appear
[2:28:38] <$insaneintentionsyo> with platforming
[2:28:40] <%Capn_Trips> unclear
[2:28:42] <Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes A game that doesn't click with Pat.
[2:28:45] <%Ninestempest> @PlagueOfGripes it's good but has specific segments that sort of detract from it cause they don't capitalize on the game's design
[2:28:45] <%Capn_Trips> try again later
[2:28:47] <%BeezusHrist> Speaking of Endgame, while Endgame was good, for the 2020s, we need another Lord of the Ring/Harry Potter Franchise. It can't just be Marvel Again
[2:28:49] <%heartlesshealer> wind area is definitely annoying though
[2:28:50] <musti_jaja_> @plagueofgripes game that started good and just got progressively worse with time
[2:28:50] <%PettyFunk> It's a pretty good game with some definite flaws
[2:28:56] <mackumbopus> how do you swing your sword? Kappa
[2:28:59] <vVAstrAVv> its good but too hard for pat and combat no good
[2:29:00] <%BeezusHrist> 2000s >>>>> 2010s
[2:29:07] <+CptBritches> Good game with some bad sections.
[2:29:08] <+wibbwobbler> annoying game thats good is a great description
[2:29:08] <%notgarza> notgarza subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
[2:29:15] <%ArcanumArcanum> @mackumbopus you buy the second game
[2:29:17] <%BeezusHrist> 2000s Cinema >>>>>> 2010s Cinema
[2:29:23] <%kindashagg> @BeezusHrist Villenueve Dune movies that are coming out
[2:29:29] <penitentpentwitch> It flip flops. Sections that play to its strengths are good, but the occasional section that tries to be a different game can be rough.
[2:29:35] <%kindashagg> or at least the 1
[2:29:36] <%BeezusHrist> @kindashagg OH YEAH!!!
[2:29:38] <%PanicSwytch> Pat have some patience
[2:29:47] <@PlagueOfGripes> so certain segments don't reflect the core gameplay and feel like additive elements created to fill space in the overall timeline of your campaign
[2:29:52] <%BeezusHrist> @kindashagg CAN'T FUCKING WAIT
[2:29:56] <%BeezusHrist> FAV BOOK
[2:30:09] <%kindashagg> @BeezusHrist Dude me neither
[2:30:10] <penitentpentwitch> Essentially, they feel like attempts to 'break up pacing'
[2:30:19] <musti_jaja_> I'm down for anything Villeneuve after arrival
[2:30:23] <%rosemon5001> @Dakuu75 it teaches the option as soon as you get the ability but people forget to think of using it
[2:30:35] <T_Sasquatch> looooooooool
[2:30:37] <%heartlesshealer> @PlagueOfGripes I don't know about space filling, but more like they wanted to do something different and it wasn't the right choice
[2:30:41] <penitentpentwitch> The screen pushes are supposed to be crescendo moments, but they're long sections that you cannot save in that breed frustration
[2:30:41] <%BeezusHrist> i did not like Arrival, but I'm down after Bladerunner
[2:30:45] <+wibbwobbler> this game is so anti momentum
[2:31:01] <%kindashagg> Yo Bladerunner 2049 was the best
[2:31:01] <astrofalcon1> pat is finally playing ori eh
[2:31:09] <astrofalcon1> good stuff
[2:31:18] <%Metballs> "playing" is a bit strong
[2:31:18] <%kindashagg> Finally, perfect sad Ryan Gosling
[2:31:23] <Lophostrix_> @astrofalcon1 and he hates it
[2:31:24] <vVAstrAVv> its not lol
[2:31:28] <%BeezusHrist> @astrofalcon1 He hate it LUL
[2:31:29] <musti_jaja_> he's not loving it @astrofalcon1
[2:31:31] <%heartlesshealer> pat why
[2:31:32] <astrofalcon1> LUL
[2:31:39] <%Jaxnos> that arrow is where Ori is headed, not the rock Pat
[2:31:41] <Herb_guy> Is this game the year 2020?
[2:31:43] <astrofalcon1> oh boy
[2:31:43] <+someguy1472> Is it a Pat Suffer stream?
[2:31:43] <%Ninestempest> ???????????
[2:31:46] <%heartlesshealer> please save
[2:32:03] <musti_jaja_> (cause it's not that good) I mean uuuh
[2:32:07] <@PlagueOfGripes> I guess when you're designing segments in a game they should never be grueling enough that your frustration eclipses whatever other feeling you're trying to create
[2:32:16] <%DensityD> a rock
[2:32:23] <%miabyte> hell yeah
[2:32:24] <usurper_sos> Smart
[2:32:26] <%miabyte> hi plague
[2:32:29] <NoireRequiem> @someguy1472 always has been
[2:32:32] <@PlagueOfGripes> "this is fun" being trumped by "god I've been at this for hours"
[2:32:36] <%DappercatEsquire> no but feel wonder while you struggle though
[2:32:38] <astrofalcon1> well if he's not feeling this , then don't worry curse of the moon 2 is near release
[2:32:42] <%heartlesshealer> pat why
[2:32:42] <penitentpentwitch> Yup
[2:32:43] <+PlopHero> LOL
[2:32:46] <musti_jaja_> i'm looking forward to playing the sequel though, seems it's fixed lots of 1's problems
[2:32:56] <%arcielardor> companion rock
[2:32:58] <%Ninestempest> @PlagueOfGripes yeah, the game tries to be super emotional and it can really detract from it if you take an hour to do a puzzle
[2:33:03] <penitentpentwitch> Maybe take a break to read subs
[2:33:07] <+wibbwobbler> frustration was probably the intention. old school hard i guess
[2:33:09] <%Metballs> It's hard to design around "mad cause bad" though
[2:33:09] <%BeezusHrist> AVATAR 2 is coming.... LUL ........ Maybe that will change the landscape again LUL
[2:33:11] <+someguy1472> Oof. That's the worst feel.
[2:33:20] <$Dakuu75> I mean... would it be more fun if it stayed as easy as the first level the whole time?
[2:33:22] <%APegForReggie> Have you tried having fun yet?
[2:33:23] <astrofalcon1> it's a bad feel
[2:33:24] <%BeezusHrist> Avatar 1 RUINED 2010s Cinema
[2:33:29] <+someguy1472> Korra already came out though.
[2:33:38] <+someguy1472> Like, years ago I think.
[2:33:39] <%PettyFunk> @BeezusHrist Avatar 2 is pretty disappointing, I'm more excited for Avatar 4.
[2:33:45] <itesket> a sequel to the last airbender movie? PogChamp
[2:33:49] <T_Sasquatch> its quite amazing how unimpactful pop culture wise it is LUL
[2:33:50] <musti_jaja_> oof yeah those platforming or puzzle areas right after a cutscene repeating themselves every time you try got real annoying
[2:33:51] <Zebens> LUL
[2:33:53] <%BeezusHrist> @PettyFunk LUL
[2:33:54] <CursedNobleman> LUL
[2:33:55] <Lophostrix_> off
[2:34:02] <%heartlesshealer> @PlagueOfGripes You should go through the vod later and watch Pat fully check out on gravity puzzles
[2:34:02] <Psyramics> what last airbender movie?
[2:34:02] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat stop trying to brute force finesse puzzles
[2:34:05] <%Joustar_> LUL LUL psaUp
[2:34:06] <Lophostrix_> by which i mean oof
[2:34:08] <astrofalcon1> @itesket a sequel to m night's masterpiece Kappa
[2:34:09] <CursedNobleman> this makes me wanna play mario odyssey
[2:34:09] <%BeezusHrist> @itesket Jame's Cameron's Avatar
[2:34:10] <%kindashagg> Lol the disnnance around the term 'Avatar"
[2:34:12] <%half_awake1> half_awake1 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 19 months! 
[2:34:21] <T_Sasquatch> @Psyramics no blude people one
[2:34:24] <+glassesaregod> @astrofalcon1 They're making a SECOND one? PogChamp
[2:34:24] <T_Sasquatch> blue
[2:34:33] <itesket> James cameron ResidentSleeper
[2:34:33] <@PlagueOfGripes> I've had many instances in games of it trying to be fun or emotional and then kneecapping itself with irritating difficulty spieks
[2:34:34] <CursedNobleman> Thanks for the PrideKoala @half_awake1
[2:34:36] <AtrusHB> Virgin Avatar VS Chad Avatar
[2:34:38] <%DensityD> you are having fun
[2:34:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> just how it do
[2:34:40] <astrofalcon1> god i hope not
[2:34:42] <+someguy1472> Blud people, it's a bloodborne crossover!
[2:34:51] <%BeezusHrist> Jame's Cameron's sequel to Avatar has been in the works for 10 years now
[2:34:52] <musti_jaja_> and there's the combat everyone. using bash over and over
[2:34:53] <%DappercatEsquire> FIRST TRY
[2:34:56] <%BeezusHrist> James*
[2:35:04] <+wibbwobbler> i don't think he is speedrunning or brute forcing, just trying to figure it out
[2:35:04] <astrofalcon1> @glassesaregod i feel like they would make a korra movie instead Kappa
[2:35:13] <+someguy1472> I hope we see the Actors age in real time as the movies go on for 10 years.
[2:35:19] <+Taglog7> RAWK HAWK
[2:35:23] <%heartlesshealer> bye door key
[2:35:25] <penitentpentwitch> He flew past a key?
[2:35:26] <itesket> who tf trying to watch cg blue people anymore
[2:35:31] <Zebens> oh i remember hating this spikey area
[2:35:34] <%DensityD> nice job
[2:35:39] <NoireRequiem> if he spent 10 years it must be good Kappa
[2:35:39] <%Jaxnos> so this is where Pat will be real mad
[2:35:45] <$insaneintentionsyo> first game is a bit brutal
[2:35:45] <%ArcanumArcanum> it was instant cause you got hit before
[2:35:47] <%Jeemukun> Thanks for the PrideRise @half_awake1
[2:35:47] <%BeezusHrist> I haven't seen old boy in the movie who was the main character in a LONG TIME.
[2:35:48] <T_Sasquatch> i watched korra so long ago that I had actually forgotten most of the reasons why i hate it LUL
[2:35:49] <musti_jaja_> @itesket X-Men doe
[2:35:51] <DonWolo> This is the chillest I've ever seen Pat, and I'm down with that
[2:35:54] <+someguy1472> I think most people would be down for blue people in 2020. Pandoramania all over again.
[2:35:54] <$insaneintentionsyo> please play the sequel
[2:35:55] <+WarbossMetal> Is it a difficulty spike, or is pat just bad? HahaCat
[2:35:56] <%BeezusHrist> Forgot his name...
[2:35:57] <%Ninestempest> you had low health lol
[2:36:07] <astrofalcon1> so yeah will of the wisp....
[2:36:07] <%SinisterBroccoli> it just does a fuck ton
[2:36:10] <usurper_sos> Instant
[2:36:11] <AtrusHB> I think a lot of why Pat doesn't like this is actually what I love about it
[2:36:13] <usurper_sos> Death
[2:36:17] <astrofalcon1> is it fine?
[2:36:19] <+glassesaregod> @astrofalcon1 I was referring to the Curse of the Moon 2 you were talking about. Had no idea an avatar movie discussion popped up right after Kappa
[2:36:24] <RoldanDgr8> Two isn’t instant
[2:36:29] <%BeezusHrist> Yeah, there is no doubt that Avatar 2 is going to be a big thing
[2:36:33] <astrofalcon1> @glassesaregod oh Kappa
[2:36:33] <%Gallhint> This looks awful, holy shit
[2:36:34] <+someguy1472> I really dislike the "Floor/Ceiling is lava" game design.
[2:36:35] <+wibbwobbler> flappy bird
[2:36:38] <penitentpentwitch> The later half of this game feels like it is overwhelmed with too many 'instantkill' mechanics. That invalidate all the HP upgrades you've earned.
[2:36:38] <%zamzoph> don't get hit 4Head
[2:36:41] <astrofalcon1> @glassesaregod well it's out later this week Kappa
[2:36:42] <%DensityD> lets argue in chat more
[2:36:42] <$insaneintentionsyo> I was the opposite where the white palace made me rage
[2:36:43] <%BinaryFireball> wow this level looks like butt
[2:36:50] <Zebens> Just save after you've gotten one or two
[2:36:50] <%BeezusHrist> Will it change cinema like Avatar one did... for the worst though. That is the question
[2:36:52] <itesket> Wake me up when shamalan gets the rights to korra ResidentSleeper
[2:36:54] <@PlagueOfGripes> this 444,444 bp didn't last long...
[2:36:56] <%elchizzou> If you dont get hit you have nothing to worry about
[2:36:58] <fabo_joyful> so git gud lawl
[2:36:59] <%SinisterBroccoli> There is a weird dichotomy between the cute beautiful feel of the game and the harsh difficulty
[2:37:00] <%LtSurge> This is more obnoxious about difficulty than Celeste B Sides
[2:37:03] <%Piemen99> |
[2:37:07] <%spitelite> floaty
[2:37:08] <mackumbopus> press shift for focussd movement
[2:37:09] <%ArcanumArcanum> He has momentum
[2:37:11] <+glassesaregod> @astrofalcon1 Good to know. Really enjoyed the first one. Hope a Ritual of the Night 2 is also in the cards down the line
[2:37:11] <+exia2007> loosey goosey
[2:37:12] <Lophostrix_> floaty
[2:37:17] <penitentpentwitch> Go back down and save
[2:37:21] <%arcielardor> 99 dragons loose?
[2:37:23] <usurper_sos> Save
[2:37:25] <%IminyourBase> loose like your meaty butthole
[2:37:26] <%aslfrasle> He controls like a Halo Warthog
[2:37:28] <T_Sasquatch> a loose caboose , some would say Kappa
[2:37:28] <majindusto> OH BOY...TIME FOR NITPICKING
[2:37:31] <%Ninestempest> I wouldn't call it floaty, loose defintely fits
[2:37:33] <madskull456> very floaty
[2:37:33] <%DensityD> mid point sav
[2:37:34] <musti_jaja_> trial and error just gets frustrating after a while, especially if the only thing you get for it is "thank God I don't have to do that again"
[2:37:35] <@PlagueOfGripes> he preserves some of his momentum after a movement input?
[2:37:36] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> did avatar really have any impact good or bad
[2:37:40] <%WhereIsWill> but what about the EMOTION
[2:37:42] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> it seems like everyone just forgot it existed
[2:37:42] <%rosemon5001> might also be because of the controller because on the keyboard and mouse he feels perfect
[2:37:44] <%BinaryFireball> yea you can even see how loose he moves
[2:37:45] <+wibbwobbler> dat game feel
[2:37:56] <%SinisterBroccoli> I disagree
[2:37:56] <itesket> @sashagreenspiderqueen it probably awakened something in some people
[2:37:58] <Lophostrix_> @majindusto games just bad, no need for nitpicking
[2:37:59] <Explodincatz> so like Mario?
[2:38:00] <+someguy1472> Loose-y Goose.
[2:38:01] <astrofalcon1> @glassesaregod oh yeah, here's hoping iga is good for another one. That one would obviously be more polished and able to work on every system day one Kappa
[2:38:02] <T_Sasquatch> @sashagreenspiderqueen it hard pushed 3D tho
[2:38:04] <%BeezusHrist> @sashagreenspiderqueen It had a bad impact with the 3d shit. Everyone tried to copy its success
[2:38:05] <Zebens> Light-weight?
[2:38:06] <%SinisterBroccoli> I feel like the movement is the best thing about the game
[2:38:10] <vVAstrAVv> you people gotta shut the fuck up telling pat to save he cant right now idiots
[2:38:11] <%PettyFunk> He's responsive but kind of weird in the air
[2:38:12] <%IminyourBase> he maintains air momentum?
[2:38:14] <majindusto> It's Floaty...But still Good
[2:38:19] <+Taglog7> He's a floaty
[2:38:20] <penitentpentwitch> Also, another weakness is there are sections of large unsafe zones where you have to kill progress and double back to a safe zone to save.
[2:38:21] <astrofalcon1> the first one is really good and all
[2:38:23] <+glassesaregod> @astrofalcon1 One can hope Kappa
[2:38:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> so his air momentum is preserved but not his ground?
[2:38:29] <%IminyourBase> he has a jump arc?
[2:38:29] <Zebens> Light and feathery?
[2:38:29] <astrofalcon1> but boy
[2:38:40] <penitentpentwitch> Yup, air is slippery
[2:38:41] <$insaneintentionsyo> kinda like Mario's run momentum
[2:38:45] <%zestyArsenic> time to change to ff14 grinding
[2:38:46] <%elchizzou> We all knew you could do it. Kinda....
[2:38:48] <%Ninestempest> he's very light so in the air he is slippery
[2:38:49] <%Jaxnos> yes @vVAstrAVv ?
[2:38:49] <%SinisterBroccoli> yeah plague
[2:38:50] <mackumbopus> press dash
[2:38:51] <AtrusHB> >leaf spirit >is floaty *surprised pikachu*
[2:38:59] <@PlagueOfGripes> it sort of looks like he's not jumping so much as an invisible hand is lifting him, if that makes sense
[2:39:02] <+G_Thunders> I think it’s telling that doing this successfully looks goofy as hell
[2:39:02] <%IminyourBase> well... yeah otherwise you float up with the wind
[2:39:06] <%Retinolgaming> I bounced off this game too Pat, the second one feels better to play.
[2:39:07] <astrofalcon1> this is like that section in hollow knight Kappa
[2:39:09] <%Ninestempest> floaty is a bad way to describe it though cause to me floaty means that way some japanese games control that feels like ass
[2:39:10] <majindusto> Characters is Floating: Why he so Floaty?
[2:39:11] <%IminyourBase> the wind push you up
[2:39:12] <LustrousEudemon> it's not you're just doing it that way
[2:39:15] <%rosemon5001> save
[2:39:16] <%DensityD> save
[2:39:17] <%elchizzou> Eli is here!! Everybody Raise your hands and give him your energy!!!
[2:39:23] <%Ninestempest> you didn't the first time through
[2:39:23] <mackumbopus> pat has forgotten the dash button
[2:39:25] <+someguy1472> Don't die.
[2:39:29] <Shwepie> @PlagueOfGripes Barely preserved in the air. It drops to zero less than one full ori width.
[2:39:30] <%ArcanumArcanum> on that last one you're meant to preserve your upward momentum as you leave the wind
[2:39:34] <%BeezusHrist> @sashagreenspiderqueen Cinema chains entered an arms race to get 3D tech and some went out of business participating in this foolishness. Covid-19 is what will really do the indutry in
[2:39:36] <astrophizz> If this is hard then I should try out games that I've held off on because they sounded too hard. I had a good time with both Ori's - though the first one is more punishing
[2:39:37] <%SinisterBroccoli> I feel like the game was made so you have a lot of freedom in how you want to move which ends up making the game not feel very precise.
[2:39:38] <%ArcanumArcanum> but you went to the ceiling and stopped
[2:39:42] <%DensityD> having so much f u n
[2:39:44] <Lophostrix_> LMAO
[2:39:51] <%IminyourBase> pat have you thought about being good?
[2:39:55] <%Joustar_> psaFist psaPat
[2:39:55] <%Ninestempest> you just RUN THROUGH ATTACKS OF COURSE YOU WILL GET HIT
[2:39:56] <astrofalcon1> this is good for a podcast rant
[2:40:05] <$insaneintentionsyo> good ability
[2:40:07] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> @BeezusHrist good, fuckem lol
[2:40:08] <vVAstrAVv> as someone who did the chicken trials in guacamelee 2 i actually liked this part
[2:40:11] <%elchizzou> @IminyourBase The hard hitting questions
[2:40:13] <+G_Thunders> @mackumbopus ohhh wow that’s totally right huh. You’re supposed to mix dash with the parachute to do this
[2:40:18] <majindusto> Pat, Are you alright? You look tired as Shit
[2:40:21] <fairore> @astrofalcon1 he doesn't like the game ?
[2:40:24] <+wibbwobbler> noice
[2:40:26] <itesket> ori is kinda a snoozer tbh
[2:40:28] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> they tried to reactivate my amc stubs and im like "are you dumb as fuck or just malicious, cancel my shit"
[2:40:33] <$insaneintentionsyo> just he says
[2:40:37] <%IminyourBase> yeah now do all of it!
[2:40:41] <%BeezusHrist> @sashagreenspiderqueen And we got shitty 3D movies all throughout the early 2010s like Clash of the titans 1 and 2
[2:40:43] <%elchizzou> @majindusto He is just in his first form
[2:40:47] <mackumbopus> hollow knight super dash PogChamp
[2:40:52] <%PettyFunk> @fairore He liked it somewhat at first but hates it today
[2:40:57] <+wibbwobbler> microsofts golden boy
[2:40:58] <%SinisterBroccoli> I think the game just has too much freedom for Pat
[2:40:59] <+glassesaregod> Brute forcing your way through a puzzle platformer Kreygasm
[2:41:01] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> i wouldnt know because i dont watch shit popcorn cinema kek
[2:41:08] <%DensityD> SourPls
[2:41:10] <astrofalcon1> @fairore i'm guessing it's one of those days
[2:41:10] <$insaneintentionsyo> Pat will like wisps much more
[2:41:17] <%zamzoph> AngelThump
[2:41:17] <+DrFacilier> Ori seems like the kind of game you'd just do a quick look/one off of
[2:41:29] <Ipsenscastle> for real
[2:41:29] <%ArcanumArcanum> dying?
[2:41:38] <Explodincatz> for real
[2:41:41] <Shwepie> @G_Thunders Original game didn't have Dash and in this version it is optional and getting the Air Dash upgrade is optional as well. Definitely makes it easier though.
[2:41:41] <%WhereIsWill> its inspiring you to go the distance pat
[2:41:41] <%Divryne> Maybe it's time Pat went to the DLC area to get the dash.
[2:41:44] <%elchizzou> There goes that instant death again
[2:41:46] <T_Sasquatch> frustration is getting biggerrr
[2:41:48] <itesket> Ori is a game that looks nice but apart from that is kinda ResidentSleeper
[2:41:50] <T_Sasquatch> bang bang bang
[2:41:50] <%DensityD> Please describe what you would expect to be doing to this music, I'm curious to hear
[2:41:55] <%DensityD> horseback riding?
[2:41:56] <+someguy1472> This is like Civ6 music for a Native American civ.
[2:42:01] <%DensityD> crafting a tribal potion?
[2:42:03] <Mister_McDerp> its calming music to soothe the frustration
[2:42:06] <vVAstrAVv> thats cus its fly music not die music
[2:42:07] <fairore> it's time for a break
[2:42:14] <%BeezusHrist> Films putting in 3D for no reason which probably affected their production and the scripts of films LUL ugh
[2:42:20] <+someguy1472> Wait no.
[2:42:27] <%Jaxnos> that takes both triggers? weird
[2:42:28] <%Metballs> If Pat leave sto take a break he's NOT coming back
[2:42:31] <+someguy1472> It's the soundtrack for Get Over It.
[2:42:32] <+wibbwobbler> should be two hours, this is why jason schrier hates video games
[2:42:39] <musti_jaja_> in a game about flowy, imprecise, free and fast movement; here, have some precise Celeste platforming
[2:42:39] <astrofalcon1> ori
[2:42:40] <Ipsenscastle> Ori is like if people who made flash games in 2005 were given a huge production budget
[2:42:45] <%SinisterBroccoli> spikes are happening
[2:42:46] <%Jaxnos> you're being attacked and jumping into spikes.
[2:42:50] <%bluetocho13> spikes hurt PAt
[2:42:50] <%BeezusHrist> @wibbwobbler LUL
[2:42:53] <fairore> @metballs its probably for the best
[2:42:57] <astrophizz> launch from his projectiles
[2:42:58] <T_Sasquatch> drop your shield
[2:43:01] <%ItsCaptainDisco> Spikes are pure evil
[2:43:01] <%elchizzou> Sharp things hurt pat
[2:43:02] <vVAstrAVv> youre walking right into shit is happening
[2:43:05] <%spitelite> stop jumping into spikes
[2:43:07] <itesket> ?
[2:43:11] <+DrFacilier> is this a game grumps sponsored stream
[2:43:13] <Mister_McDerp> this seems like a game I would hate
[2:43:15] <astrofalcon1> alright
[2:43:15] <AtrusHB> @vVAstrAVv this
[2:43:16] <%Ninestempest> you need to bash the spider attacks
[2:43:20] <$insaneintentionsyo> pat..
[2:43:26] <%Jaxnos> THOSE ARE SPIKES AT THE TOP
[2:43:27] <T_Sasquatch> ?
[2:43:28] <%Jaxnos> PAT
[2:43:30] <%SinisterBroccoli> No idea
[2:43:31] <+glassesaregod> You took damage from the spikes...
[2:43:34] <%Gallhint> Wooooooooooowww ack ack ack ack ack
[2:43:36] <%Dr_DangerPhD> the top of the wall is a spike?
[2:43:37] <astrofalcon1> is this a dspat moment?
[2:43:38] <+Delenay> i think theres a bad wall there. its on an angle
[2:43:38] <%SinisterBroccoli> When you get hit you move
[2:43:41] <ficboyog> Pat you okay?
[2:43:44] <+Delenay> it thinks you are flat
[2:43:48] <vVAstrAVv> imagine damage having knockback
[2:43:50] <%elchizzou> maybe a weird pixel that bounces you off the wall?
[2:43:51] <astrofalcon1> ok that might be an animation thing
[2:43:55] <majindusto> Yeah, if Pat Stops...he will Never finish the game ever
[2:43:57] <%SinisterBroccoli> There's a little lip on the wall maybe
[2:43:57] <%arcielardor> you just need to not suck
[2:43:59] <vVAstrAVv> pat this is crazy
[2:44:02] <+Loyks> Take a breather Pat
[2:44:03] <%luftraumm1> yeah
[2:44:06] <%BinaryFireball> I see it
[2:44:08] <KingVantq> I'm guessing thats the end of a platform and he jumps by default
[2:44:08] <%azure22900> Nah thats odd
[2:44:10] <+wibbwobbler> patch this
[2:44:11] <%ArcanumArcanum> there's a dip in the wall there that is bouncing you off. I don't think that' intentional
[2:44:12] <Explodincatz> i see it
[2:44:14] <%IminyourBase> have you tried letting go of the button?
[2:44:14] <%Ninestempest> oh i see
[2:44:15] <%DensityD> wow chat is so supportive, ya know?
[2:44:15] <Mister_McDerp> I see it now
[2:44:16] <astrofalcon1> yeah i see it
[2:44:16] <Profmcstevie> It's a curve that's counting as a edge, weird
[2:44:16] <vVAstrAVv> oh now i see it
[2:44:16] <%BallerSwagBro9k> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2:44:18] <%SomeSageAdvice> if the game has a bug, then its a bug
[2:44:19] <%BeezusHrist> Whenever he approaches the spider, it makes him jump off into the spikes. That is what he's complaining baout
[2:44:19] <%Ninestempest> looks liek a lip to land on
[2:44:20] <%luftraumm1> the game is expecting you to bash the projectiles
[2:44:21] <%PettyFunk> Is it like there's a Tony Hawk halfpipe in the wall?
[2:44:21] <%BinaryFireball> it doesnt happen every time which is even worse
[2:44:23] <+G_Thunders> I think that tiny crack in the wall is the problem
[2:44:25] <%elchizzou> Is this the true power of Crazy Talk?
[2:44:25] <madskull456> Ori is sentient, and he hates his own game
[2:44:26] <%IncredibleMeh> man gets gaslit by videogame
[2:44:33] <vVAstrAVv> das a bug lol
[2:44:37] <%BeezusHrist> BAD ANGLE SON
[2:44:39] <itesket> I think its time to play a good game :)
[2:44:39] <%YakumoYomi> It seems he jumps every time he hits that little crevice in the wall
[2:44:40] <%Ninestempest> that seems
[2:44:41] <Ipsenscastle> Play Hollow Knight again
[2:44:41] <%Ninestempest> REALLY bad
[2:44:44] <vVAstrAVv> try loading idk
[2:44:46] <%PanicSwytch> Pats existential nightmare
[2:44:48] <%TheShal> LOL
[2:44:48] <%Ninestempest> for once pat is not crazy
[2:44:49] <CursedNobleman> pat suffers at
[2:44:50] <astrofalcon1> @IncredibleMeh reviewers in a nutshell eh
[2:44:52] <%Gallhint> Man am I so glad I never bought this game
[2:44:53] <T_Sasquatch> @IncredibleMeh strong , see you in the next harddrive article
[2:44:56] <%DensityD> Kappa you need to let go of the button, but also press more buttons. just be sure not to press the button at that time or you'll fuck it all up Kappa
[2:44:57] <musti_jaja_> game is b a d
[2:44:57] <+wibbwobbler> email Microsoft
[2:44:58] <Storm_Samurai> this is the patrick i missed
[2:44:59] <%bevyrage> @YakumoYomi it's automatically having him jump off the wall when he hits that little bit
[2:45:01] <%Jaxnos> how did you run over it fine the first few times?
[2:45:01] <%rosemon5001> its the wall there its not totally flat that happens when the surface i wobbely
[2:45:01] <%Ninestempest> just basht he spider projectiles
[2:45:03] <%Jaxnos> like there
[2:45:06] <%PettyFunk> Wait it didn't happen that time
[2:45:08] <Mister_McDerp> gamesux
[2:45:09] <majindusto> FRUSTRATION...GETTING BIGGER
[2:45:14] <usurper_sos> This is the dark souls of video games
[2:45:16] <%Ninestempest> WAIT HE WENT UP THAT TIME??
[2:45:16] <+Ez3z> this is a really good game actually pat is just bad at it
[2:45:18] <%BinaryFireball> the number one thing you need to make sure when making these types of games is that the controls do what you expect them to do. It needs to feel crisp or it's the worst feeling in the world
[2:45:21] <%Gallhint> 1st time
[2:45:22] <Zebens> PogChamp
[2:45:23] <%afronooch> Patti pls plae dmc2
[2:45:29] <%SinisterBroccoli> I thought people like this game?
[2:45:35] <astrofalcon1> dmc2? the good dmc?
[2:45:39] <mackumbopus> which do you prefer - hollow knight super dash or ori super dash?
[2:45:39] <astrofalcon1> the only good one
[2:45:44] <+WarbossMetal> You have to manually jump over something, in a platform game, woah < :'0
[2:45:45] <a_mad_dragon> oh no you had to PLAY THE GAME
[2:45:49] <KingVantq> @SinisterBroccoli everyone hates it now i guess
[2:45:49] <+G_Thunders> The only problem here is that the crack in the wall isn’t prominent enough
[2:45:52] <%bevyrage> people do like this game, but it is the first one and IT DOES HAVE SOME ISSUES
[2:45:55] <itesket> NotLikeThis
[2:45:55] <%SirGO0SE> LUL
[2:46:02] <%PettyFunk> @WarbossMetal It looked like a legit bug
[2:46:05] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat you hit more spikes in this game that anyone else i have ever seen
[2:46:06] <T_Sasquatch> its a likable game , its just different when you actually have to go through it
[2:46:09] <+Loyks> Is your controller ok?
[2:46:11] <%afronooch> Yes dmc2 is the best
[2:46:18] <%SinisterBroccoli> KingVantq Dude I'm in that boat it's like as soon as someone doesn't like it everyone comes out of the floorboards
[2:46:19] <madskull456> lol
[2:46:20] <%BinaryFireball> oh that's horrible
[2:46:20] <%IminyourBase> that's dumb
[2:46:22] <%BeezusHrist> lul
[2:46:24] <Ipsenscastle> that's horrible
[2:46:25] <%ArcanumArcanum> BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE INPUTTING WALLRUN COMMAND
[2:46:29] <T_Sasquatch> nice
[2:46:29] <AtrusHB> @PatStaresAt take a break man

[2:46:30] <@PlagueOfGripes> amazing
[2:46:30] <Explodincatz> oof
[2:46:32] <%zamzoph> don't aim it higher
[2:46:32] <astrofalcon1> dmc 2 makes dmc 3 look really bad
[2:46:32] <%Ninestempest> THAT'S AWFUL
[2:46:33] <Mister_McDerp> liking a game doesn't mean its faultless chat
[2:46:36] <@PlagueOfGripes> it's a feature
[2:46:43] <ethanjbennett> thats bad
[2:46:45] <%Ninestempest> THAT IS FUCKING TRASH
[2:46:47] <musti_jaja_> 5/10
[2:46:50] <majindusto> Your controller is JANK yo!
[2:46:50] <%bevyrage> uh?
[2:46:50] <$Dakuu75> that doesn't seem right...
[2:46:50] <+SleeplessRhythme> bruh you get infinite respawns to wherever you set it
[2:46:50] <Ipsenscastle> LUL
[2:46:51] <penitentpentwitch> The aesthetic of this game is good, the gameplay can be all over the place. It feels like sections of this were minimally play tested.
[2:46:52] <%BinaryFireball> hahahahahaha
[2:46:54] <+Delenay> HAAA
[2:46:57] <%IminyourBase> OH RIGHT you need to trigger the trigger in order to TRIGGER THE TRIGGERED EVENT
[2:46:57] <+wibbwobbler> it just works
[2:46:58] <MillaMoks> Wow that’s actually really bad.
[2:47:00] <Zebens> LUL
[2:47:00] <penitentpentwitch> This one for example

[2:47:09] <%BinaryFireball> OH WALL SENPAI
[2:47:12] <+jjjkopf> what's the difference between normal and definitive edition
[2:47:15] <%YakumoYomi> psaSmug

[2:47:31] <%MisterRockett> ????
[2:47:31] <$Dakuu75> that's your controller dude
[2:47:33] <%Ninestempest> @luftraumm1 it was when it came out

[2:47:37] <musti_jaja_> @jjjkopf extra abilities and areas
[2:47:37] <%elchizzou> This is obviously a feature and not the failure of the game designer
[2:47:40] <%Jaxnos> so it's the controller.
[2:47:40] <astrofalcon1> platformers PogChamp
[2:47:40] <%BinaryFireball> Pat play something you like man
[2:47:40] <majindusto> DEATH LOOP
[2:47:41] <%Ninestempest> but this game has seen MANY patches
[2:47:42] <Psyramics> are you sure that's not your controller being fucky?
[2:47:42] <%LaughingCatt> wtf
[2:47:43] <penitentpentwitch> How old is that controller?
[2:47:44] <vVAstrAVv> stay determined
[2:47:45] <%DappercatEsquire> Pat, do you feel wonder? From the OST and the art?
[2:47:45] <%arancet> are you sure your controller aint off?
[2:47:46] <%BinaryFireball> you dont need to finish this
[2:47:46] <%Ninestempest> okay that's definitely your controller
[2:47:49] <%Townspoon> Ooooo punisher ori
[2:47:50] <%Ninestempest> ???????????????
[2:47:54] <ethanjbennett> lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2:47:55] <HungryHungryEmu> might be a controller issue?
[2:47:57] <Zebroneath> Did they fix this in Ori 2?
[2:48:04] <+DrFacilier> But pat u beat dark soul
[2:48:04] <%Metballs> Dude, if your pad is pulling left it's not teh game's fault
[2:48:04] <%luftraumm1> ok so there might be some nuance to the topic of tightness of the mechanics
[2:48:12] <majindusto> It really looks like it's a controller problem
[2:48:16] <Shwepie> Go up.
[2:48:17] <+Delenay> it lets the air up
[2:48:19] <+Delenay> no
[2:48:19] <Visorak6> dig up
[2:48:20] <taco_flambe> @PatStaresAt use sticky walls
[2:48:21] <%bevyrage> @Zebroneath they removed the overlapping inputs entirely
[2:48:23] <KingVantq> @jjjkopf extra content and fast travel toareas that were unaccessible before
[2:48:23] <+Robo_Wizard1> lol at Pat blaming the game for his busted shit
[2:48:23] <%DensityD> perhaps float up even more
[2:48:25] <%SinisterBroccoli> Zebroneath I haven't seen any of these issues till pat's stream
[2:48:26] <Landedx> up
[2:48:26] <+Delenay> it lets the air up higher in the map
[2:48:27] <+WarbossMetal> Have you tried aiming charge jumps with the right stick Pat? :0
[2:48:28] <CursedNobleman> is Ori the Dark Souls of platformers?
[2:48:29] <Profmcstevie> Wind tunnel~
[2:48:31] <vVAstrAVv> just glide back up
[2:48:33] <%notgarza> inb4 Crazy talk
[2:48:36] <+wibbwobbler> he threw the controller, hilarity ensued
[2:48:36] <%SinisterBroccoli> You gotta go up
[2:48:39] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Pat is the first streamer i watch who doesn't like Ori. This is incredible LUL
[2:48:41] <AtrusHB> Yeah I'm thinking it's a controller issue too. I never had any of the problems Pat's had when I played it.
[2:48:41] <%BeezusHrist> HIS PAD ISN'T PULLING RIGHT. HE SET IT DOWN AND THE BUTTON WAS BEING PULLED BY THE COUCH
[2:48:44] <%luftraumm1> I didn't find many problems with the gameplay in my playthrough
[2:48:45] <%BallerSwagBro9k> ITS A PAT PROBLEM
[2:48:50] <%BeezusHrist> LEFT*
[2:48:57] <+Delenay> the air goes more up
[2:48:57] <Psyramics> I thought you were demonstrating something, like the stick was at neutral and ori was walking anyway
[2:49:00] <%DensityD> lift
[2:49:02] <%rosemon5001> @BallerSwagBro9k truuuuuuuuuuuu

[2:50:29] <%ArcanumArcanum> Pat don't let your Earth Day hate affect the game
[2:50:29] <Ipsenscastle> Yeah, because the game itself doesn't even back that shit up
[2:50:30] <%zamzoph> no
[2:50:30] <vVAstrAVv> no
[2:50:31] <@PlagueOfGripes> Otherworld from FF10 should be playing instead

[2:50:50] <%BallerSwagBro9k> One of the most beloved games of the past decade, chastised by an orb man
[2:50:52] <%rosemon5001> because its not for the short tempered?
[2:50:52] <%chainedwolfstress> Thanks for the PrideUwu @goopyeuclid
[2:50:53] <+Delenay> its magic
[2:50:57] <+wibbwobbler> its mocking you
[2:50:59] <penitentpentwitch> Yup. The unfair sections are working against the tone. Like an art critic giving you his sell while he pisses on you.

[2:51:26] <+Delenay> just to res the friend he doesnt know you have
[2:51:26] <itesket> cause hes stupid
[2:51:30] <madskull456> the game is telling you how to feel with its music while simultaneously stomping ass
[2:51:32] <%Piemen99> Are they gonna fuck?
[2:51:33] <%IminyourBase> because ori is important
[2:51:34] <+DrFacilier> because kindness
[2:51:35] <%elchizzou> Because he is trying to create Gill
[2:51:36] <+jjjkopf> he hates who he is
[2:51:40] <Herb_guy> because his a racist
[2:51:43] <%BallerSwagBro9k> He filled her soul with LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

[2:52:37] <%weissguard> Zippity Zap, here comes the Thunder Clap.
[2:52:38] <%ssjklyco> Because you can only use the Lazerous pit to bring people back when it fits the story.
[2:52:38] <penitentpentwitch> So about that Hades stream later
[2:52:40] <fairore> man I really wanna get some food
[2:52:52] <%Midashu> Is this game supposed to be fun? because a frustrated pat leads me to believe otherwise
[2:52:53] <itesket> Man falls asleep on stream
[2:52:53] <%TheStarbecue> kermit
[2:52:55] <%SirGO0SE> Ori make Pat sleepy baby
[2:52:57] <majindusto> GOD STRUCK YOU DOWN HARD LUL
[2:53:06] <musti_jaja_> last zone is upcoming pat, just pull through please (and then there are other, better indie games awaiting)
[2:53:20] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @midashu This is considered one of the top 10 indies of all time
[2:53:24] <%SinisterBroccoli> Remember when this was a bad game that everyone hated universally?
[2:53:28] <mackumbopus> can'r wait for silksong where you get to fight as Ori.
[2:53:31] <%ladomania> Nature is for dorks
[2:53:31] <madskull456> lol
[2:53:37] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @sinisterbroccoli no
[2:53:38] <+wibbwobbler> lou2 speedrun?
[2:53:42] <+Delenay> bounce up
[2:53:44] <@SoFarFetched> This game can be frustrating for certain people
[2:53:46] <@SoFarFetched> it happens
[2:53:47] <%elchizzou> Pat has found a way to be asleep and unconsciously play games on twitch
[2:53:51] <%SGrim> If there are other, better games, why play this one?
[2:53:52] <itesket> @BallerSwagBro9k what are the other 9
[2:53:54] <%Ninestempest> you can fight as ori RIGHT NOW in rivals of aether :O
[2:54:03] <madskull456> Nature is beautiful, meanwhile Ori over here crushing baby birds lol
[2:54:15] <%elchizzou> @SGrim Cant always play what you want
[2:54:18] <musti_jaja_> ori is considered incredible for reasons I do not get. but the sequel seems to be much improved
[2:54:20] <@SoFarFetched> I think I had trouble with this area too
[2:54:21] <cipher758> I think the game is beautiful and the soundtrack is great, but I honestly prefer Hollow Knight more. But this is incredibly subjective.
[2:54:21] <%azure22900> reverse shortcut
[2:54:23] <%ArcanumArcanum> dig up stupid
[2:54:24] <+jjjkopf> SICK
[2:54:26] <Lophostrix_> DIG UP

[2:54:42] <KingVantq> just fast travel to where you need go
[2:54:46] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @itesket i dont them all but theres Hollow Knight, Bastion, Shovel Knight
[2:54:48] <penitentpentwitch> Take a break, read donations
[2:54:49] <+wibbwobbler> darksouls
[2:54:49] <%Jaxnos> that's a wrap
[2:54:51] <AtrusHB> @PatStareAt IMO the game's going for a "nature is beautiful but unforgiving" kinda thing
[2:54:53] <Zebens> LUL
[2:54:53] <Xelhesia> its ok pat
[2:54:53] <@SoFarFetched> LUL
[2:54:58] <itesket> Ori is a game that looks nice with a nice soundtrack but thats about it for me tbh
[2:54:58] <+dmtjinni> Pat! I missed u, u trusty Goblin!

[2:55:06] <%BallerSwagBro9k> WHY ARE YOU LIKE THJS
[2:55:06] <@SoFarFetched> Its moments like these people tune in to twitch for
[2:55:07] <%SinisterBroccoli> it's okay to stop
[2:55:08] <+QuesoFM> abandon ship
[2:55:08] <%SGrim> @elchizzou but play implies enjoyment. Don't you need to want something to play it? If you aren't enjoying it, aren't you just suffering through it?
[2:55:11] <%ItsCaptainDisco> F
[2:55:15] <%Divryne> Why is Pat like this?
[2:55:18] <$insaneintentionsyo> bawkSmile
[2:55:23] <+jjjkopf> Pat why would you think a metroidvania is about exploration? Ori is special

[2:55:44] <a_mad_dragon> ooh good idea
[2:55:45] <%SinisterBroccoli> Well I still like this game
[2:55:53] <Wan6Saber> @Divryne is this still the same Pat?
[2:55:54] <+wibbwobbler> poor paige
[2:55:55] <%SGrim> @SoFarFetched I am a League Player glorySuffer
[2:55:55] <%Joustar_> Pat: SHIT FUCKING GAME AH DAMMIT
[2:55:56] <musti_jaja_> @pettyfunk LUL
[2:56:00] <AtrusHB> @PatStaresAt Also I HIGHLY suggest you take a 20-30 minute break before you start the last dungeon
[2:56:01] <+WarbossMetal> Oh man this one is great
[2:56:01] <%Metballs> Game's good, Pat just mad cos bad tbh
[2:56:03] <%DappercatEsquire> But Pat, you haven't played the game for <arbitrary amount of time>, how can you say it's bad
[2:56:06] <@SoFarFetched> @SGrim Im very sorry for your loss
[2:56:12] <KingVantq> @SinisterBroccoli same
[2:56:16] <%SinisterBroccoli> Too bad it's tuesday cuz I'd love to hear about this on the podcast
[2:56:19] <musti_jaja_> can totally see where pat is coming from, ori is highly overrated
[2:56:25] <@PlagueOfGripes> Pat is feeling what I felt after getting to Vauthry, only to have him leave, and be forced to slog through a dozen more quests to build a tower to reach him again
[2:56:25] <%SGrim> @SoFarFetched I'm a masochist. It's what i wanted.
[2:56:28] <%Jaxnos> yeah it's still a good game. it's just hard and rough. like a cat tongue. but some people like the feeling of cat licks, like me.
[2:56:38] <mackumbopus> coffee is ori's favourite laxative
[2:56:38] <@PlagueOfGripes> a "Welcome to Tomra" effect of not giving a shit anymore and just being full of spite
[2:56:38] <%emperordread> I was a league player but I got perma banned lol
[2:56:40] <chambatron> Is Ori 2 significantly better thant the first one or more of the same?
[2:56:44] <%za7az> I just got here, what happened?
[2:56:48] <%elchizzou> @SGrim Sometimes you gotta suffer through stuff to show a contrast to your audience from what you like and dont like
[2:56:50] <%hzealot> more same
[2:56:52] <%SinisterBroccoli> I dont' think it's overrated, it's just kkinda janky and pat doesn't like the jank
[2:56:58] <+jjjkopf> I dropped Ori cause it didn't feel like a metroidvania, it was just a platformer disgused as being open world
[2:56:58] <mackumbopus> ori hurt pat
[2:56:59] <%DappercatEsquire> @za7az he's not having a good time
[2:56:59] <fairore> @chambatron that's what I heard
[2:57:00] <musti_jaja_> @za7az pat hates ori and is taking a break
[2:57:05] <%SinisterBroccoli> chambatron it's very different
[2:57:19] <@SoFarFetched> I think this game even has an achievement for speedrunning it and not dying at all.
[2:57:20] <AtrusHB> @chambatron IMO blind forest is a 9/10 while will of the wisps is a 12/10
[2:57:24] <+wibbwobbler> can't argue that its a bad game. didn't like it tho
[2:57:28] <@SoFarFetched> as two seperate achievements
[2:57:33] <%za7az> Oh dear WutFace
[2:57:33] <%Jaxnos> yup it does farfetched
[2:57:36] <%SGrim> @elchizzou that sounds like an excellent way to burn yourself out super fast.
[2:57:38] <Profmcstevie> There is a one hit mode and achievements tied to it
[2:57:41] <Wan6Saber> Is Pat okay? He does seem a bit more sedated than usual....
[2:57:45] <%SinisterBroccoli> chambatron combat is totally different and you get a different upgrade system, like 3 different ones
[2:57:48] <Polengoldur> just got here, is it over already?
[2:57:50] <@PlagueOfGripes> was the big rock titan you had to build in 14 to reach the final boss called Mt. Gulg?
[2:57:58] <@SoFarFetched> So probably makes sense on the difficulty for it to have a "don't die" achievemente
[2:58:01] <+Delenay> break cause hoes mad
[2:58:01] <AtrusHB> @Polengoldur break
[2:58:04] <%hzealot> @patstaresat has covid confirmed
[2:58:09] <+Delenay> its on NORMAL
[2:58:15] <musti_jaja_> @polengoldur pat got frustrated and is on a coffee break
[2:58:25] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Ive died quite a bit on normal
[2:58:28] <AtrusHB> covfefid Kappa
[2:58:31] <%SinisterBroccoli> movement is even more improved in will of the wisps
[2:58:31] <+Delenay> be a coward like me and play on easy
[2:58:32] <penitentpentwitch> Twas the name of the dungeon in FF14
[2:58:32] <%SGrim> @hzealot no, AngriestPat got covid. That's why he's dead now.
[2:58:33] <@BigNaturalMan59> the mountian was mt glug @PlagueOfGripes
[2:58:38] <@SoFarFetched> cause certain areas fucked me up. But I was fine with the g ame overall
[2:58:43] <Polengoldur> @musti_jaja_ but its an easy game for babies. not like that Hollow Knight or something
[2:58:47] <%SinisterBroccoli> I love just getting the ability to essential fly in Ori 2
[2:58:48] <%elchizzou> @SGrim I definitely agree with you, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. A good point was made that he is playing this as his break or transition into something he does like
[2:58:48] <%hzealot> ahhhh the lore
[2:58:51] <@PlagueOfGripes> building that stupid thing is when it really set in for me
[2:58:53] <%SinisterBroccoli> essentialy
[2:58:54] <penitentpentwitch> I don't think the Golem is ever properly named
[2:59:04] <%hzealot> whend next paige stream
[2:59:05] <%Starotter70> What context should I use this emote for? psaCaco
[2:59:10] <%hzealot> its been a month
[2:59:13] <@SoFarFetched> when pat's in angy mode
[2:59:14] <@BigNaturalMan59> dont ever let it set in
[2:59:22] <@SoFarFetched> cause someone is shilling FFXI
[2:59:23] <%Starotter70> psaCaco
[2:59:27] <%SinisterBroccoli> I'm assuming she's working
[2:59:35] <AtrusHB> Yeah combat in will of the wisps takes more than a few cues from Hollow Knight by the devs' own admission
[2:59:35] <MrDemsus> larani1Charrbara
[2:59:36] <Polengoldur> Paige left pat for a skeleton confirmed
[2:59:39] <%Gallhint> Did Pat explode? was afk
[2:59:39] <@BigNaturalMan59> FFXI IS BETTER
[2:59:39] <%Ranryu692> did Pat go take a rage shit?
[2:59:48] <fairore> @hzealot waiting for vr stream to?
[2:59:48] <penitentpentwitch> Didn't Peach say Pat is at his angriest when he's quiet?
[2:59:52] <%Starotter70> Why would someone shill a bad game tho? Kappa
[2:59:54] <@SoFarFetched> @BigNaturalMan59 You know what's better than FFXI.....You psaDab psaDab psaDab
[2:59:59] <%SinisterBroccoli> I like the aesthetic of XI a lot
[3:00:00] <musti_jaja_> @polengoldur yes verr eesie, bat needs to git gud and beat the at-odds level design with big gamer skillz
[3:00:04] <@SoFarFetched> And yeah Paige has said when they get angry,they get really quiet
[3:00:11] <@BigNaturalMan59> inochiCry
[3:00:12] <%hzealot> @fairore I just want more Phoenix
[3:00:31] <%SinisterBroccoli> I get quiet when I'm angry or sad
[3:00:44] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah Im the same.
[3:00:45] <%SinisterBroccoli> and happy
[3:00:49] <%hzealot> we're lucky to get 1 ruby weapon hour a month
[3:00:51] <@SoFarFetched> I get super quiet cause Im too angy to think and talk
[3:00:56] <Polengoldur> if thats the case then pat has never been angry
[3:00:59] <fairore> @hzealot that's fair
[3:01:05] <AtrusHB> Pat's a "calm before the storm" kinda guy
[3:01:05] <%SinisterBroccoli> mhmm exactly
[3:01:06] <musti_jaja_> as fun as dunking on the game is, I hope the next area isn't as bad and pat gets through it on a somewhat positive note. at least relative to what's been happening so far
[3:01:17] <%bevyrage> @hzealot to be fair paige streams for more than an hour per month
[3:01:19] <@BigNaturalMan59> when im mad i just play FFXI
[3:01:22] <mackumbopus> pat wuill you be playing the Ace Combat 7 DLC missions?

[3:08:32] <%PettyFunk> Wax
[3:08:34] <%SomeSageAdvice> its wax paper
[3:08:34] <%rumtumtugnutz> Wax
[3:08:36] <Wan6Saber> play Ori again, dude
[3:08:37] <madskull456> Ori was too strong
[3:08:37] <+Delenay> to preserve the freshness
[3:08:39] <%Nupinoop296> why did Ori die
[3:08:40] <%ssjklyco> It's edible
[3:08:40] <Profmcstevie> So empty wednesday I presume
[3:08:41] <%Ranryu692> wax
[3:08:42] <@BigNaturalMan59> thats not paper, its choese
[3:08:42] <+Glitchesarecool> quiettCry
[3:08:43] <Zebroneath> Ori died for cheese
[3:08:43] <%heartlesshealer> regular paper affects the taste
[3:08:43] <%gespenst25> Is it grease proof paper?
[3:08:44] <dr_sweets> It's just waxed paper, for the cheese sweat
[3:08:45] <%Starotter70> Can I have some Cheese?
[3:08:46] <sperium3000> I don't remember it being that hard but ok
[3:08:48] <+walternatorz> is there a twitch category for eating frustration cheese?
[3:08:49] <ZeeWolfman> Cheesepaper is less greasy
[3:08:52] <%xWanderingFlame> psaBlind
[3:08:52] <%Aeoneth> oh no he's getting philosophical again
[3:08:53] <@SoFarFetched> it's so it doesn't stick
[3:08:53] <%optimasmaximas> @PettyFunk ori died, but pat's salt did not
[3:08:54] <Polengoldur> cheese doesn;t stick to wax
[3:08:54] <Amadeusguy> because it doesn't stick
[3:08:55] <%Gallhint> They literally dip cheese in wax pat!
[3:08:55] <MrDemsus> To defend it from Skaven
[3:08:56] <dr_sweets> Sweaty cheese
[3:08:56] <%SirGO0SE> its more about cheesing up your wax
[3:08:56] <penitentpentwitch> Easier to seperate
[3:08:57] <sendart> so it doesn't stick?
[3:08:57] <%Jekado> is it wax paper or parchment paper?
[3:08:57] <Zebens> keep it fresh
[3:08:57] <+Delenay> so it doesnt melt into 1 pile?
[3:08:58] <majindusto> Pat to afraid of Ori
[3:08:58] <%arancet> prevents moisture loss
[3:08:59] <astrophizz> choese
[3:09:00] <+wibbwobbler> tastes pretty good
[3:09:01] <%ssjklyco> so you can wax it off
[3:09:01] <%ladomania> so your cheese doesn't stick together
[3:09:01] <madskull456> to remove the hairs
[3:09:02] <SocialMisfitGamer> Pat has officialy gone crazy from Cheese Paper
[3:09:02] <%SomeSageAdvice> to prevent it from getting soaked and moist, keeps them seperated
[3:09:02] <FoolproofDread> less hair that way
[3:09:02] <%miabyte> ...
[3:09:03] <chambatron> So it's greasy and doesn't stick
[3:09:04] <ZeeWolfman> LESS GREASE = LESS STICK = EASY CHEESE ACCESS
[3:09:05] <%luftraumm1> you chucking the stream?
[3:09:06] <@SoFarFetched> so you can easily pull it off.
[3:09:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> wax is hydrophobic so the cheese doesn't get mouldy

[3:15:31] <%bentarcher> Thanks for the PridePenguin @iceballstwitch
[3:15:31] <%LtSurge> Every time you prestige a character, get yourself some extra cheese

[3:16:38] <Polengoldur> @SinisterBroccoli and lie to the killer about where people are
[3:16:39] <@SoFarFetched> Agitation is like low B Tier Perk.
[3:16:44] <%Dementedpenguin> Agitation is only good for a specific use, not if you're playing a normal match
[3:16:45] <%CalderGaming> look i don't make the rules

[3:42:52] <$Dakuu75> @LegendGHT it's too tough for Pat
[3:42:54] <+Quandiverous> 1/3 of the games I play in DBD are people afk or just farming dailies and not actually playing the game IT SUCKS
[3:42:54] <%PettyFunk> Would CubeHead be better?
[3:42:55] <Huntercd> Where is Triangle girl?

[3:43:16] <Polengoldur> @Quandiverous sounds like warframe
[3:43:16] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> @SoFarFetched nice
[3:43:18] <Shwepie> @LegendGHT Pat didn't click with Ori therefore it is bad.
[3:43:19] <alwayspronking> its very forward
[3:43:20] <@SoFarFetched> Paige has been asleep during the day now LUL

[3:43:33] <%ragingbrachy> is ori cancelled forever? moon2S
[3:43:34] <+Tnick1> What made you stop Playing Ori?
[3:43:34] <%bevyrage> guys you gotta remember that JJ admits that there's some faults to the first game, and she loves the second game because it fixed all the issues of the original
[3:43:36] <%SvenHolgersson> IS REAL
[3:43:39] <narusao> ori and the blind with rage forrest
[3:43:40] <%Laecerelius> Paige has become a vampire
[3:43:42] <%twistedj3ster> Oney is the most frightening killer
[3:43:44] <jorniev> PAT DID NOT LIKE ORI THEREFORE HE DOESNT LIKE IT
[3:43:44] <%bhp_99> Did views go up when you put on DBD?
[3:43:45] <+DoktorZee> i wanna get matched against you but i got rank 4 survivor :(
[3:43:46] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL I thought he was talking about Ori and the Blind Forest
[3:43:47] <%Agami23> know who would make a cool killer for this game? stefano from evil within 2
[3:43:50] <Herb_guy> Ori doesn't deserve a night
[3:43:54] <%tehbeardedbard> oh look its pyramid heads sister triangle girl... she gives the worst head

[3:44:27] <%BeezusHrist> SCREAM GUY
[3:44:34] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I totally didn't want to watch Pat play Ori, so this is a dub for me
[3:44:37] <%DKDiamantes> @QuietteShy @miabyte I second that
[3:44:38] <%iceballstwitch> you should try demo gorg. he screams real good
[3:44:38] <Huntercd> When's Heather?

[3:44:56] <%DKDiamantes> I heard Demo was like super good or something

[3:44:58] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> is demo shit?
[3:45:02] <@SoFarFetched> I still gotta bug Paige about that LUL
[3:45:03] <%Garthunox> oof
[3:45:05] <%SirGO0SE> LUL

[3:45:12] <Zebens> LUL
[3:45:13] <%SvenHolgersson> THE MUD SLINGING IS REAL
[3:45:14] <%QuietteShy> BULLSHIT
[3:45:16] <%Cozy90> Pat you check out ex zodiac? it looks neat
[3:45:21] <%QuietteShy> i was carrying the fucking team

[3:45:22] <%abakkus> LUL
[3:45:24] <%miabyte> owo I fucking suuuck but cool cool
[3:45:32] <+Glitchesarecool> Pat does real good when DK isn't in voice chat
[3:45:41] <%Target616> He has a cool mori, though
[3:45:44] <+RowenCleric> I heard that those two are just the worst dbd players in existence, Pat never lies
[3:45:45] <Meekest> Some Killers don't match certain play styles
[3:45:46] <Decc> Deathslinger's design is deccChefKiss
[3:45:47] <%ragingbrachy> they should add jeff the killer to this
[3:45:50] <Animal_Farm4> Why do you hate Demo?
[3:45:52] <%iceballstwitch> demo can keep up in reds but you must master the portal
[3:45:54] <%ragingbrachy> they should add the rake to this
[3:45:55] <RedoctoberWolf> Spirit takes a lot of work
[3:45:56] <@SoFarFetched> @QuietteShy You were truly the MVP carrying the team,but they all wanted to wiggle out.Especially Pat.
[3:46:00] <%Ascethetic> shes only good with decent headphones
[3:46:00] <%king_wragles> Wait, I thought you liked Death Slinger?
[3:46:04] <%rumtumtugnutz> PH = Penis Hat!
[3:46:05] <Meekest> If you don't like the way you have to play as Demo, it's understandable
[3:46:07] <Sogeki_Dan> Is clown good yet?
[3:46:10] <%king_wragles> Then I can't hear
[3:46:12] <%Gogogolem> Spirit is a mind game killer
[3:46:13] <+Glitchesarecool> you just like PH because he's a silent hill
[3:46:14] <%xWanderingFlame> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhead
[3:46:16] <%BeezusHrist> What does cream guy do?
[3:46:16] <@SoFarFetched> You definitely gotta practice with Deathslinger
[3:46:23] <Polengoldur> @ragingbrachy actually, a couple SCP/creepypasta monsters would be cool
[3:46:23] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I am good
[3:46:24] <%Agami23> myers is real fun
[3:46:25] <%Doctor_Death_Bed> I am fun
[3:46:26] <Decc> Myers can hella scare you
[3:46:26] <%ragingbrachy> be hag next game pls
[3:46:28] <%azure22900> Doctors fun.
[3:46:28] <%Ascethetic> oh god yeah
[3:46:28] <@SoFarFetched> cream guy?
[3:46:34] <%BeezusHrist> What does Ghostface do?
[3:46:34] <%QuietteShy> was deadslinger supposed to be Blood tie in? coz hes an undead cowboy with glowing eyes and his name is Caleb, same as blood protagonist, but its like an official thing
[3:46:35] <%heartlesshealer> because
[3:46:36] <%AnIrishPapaya> Myers on that Tier 3 tear is some bs
[3:46:37] <Meekest> New Doctor is fun
[3:46:40] <%Agami23> myers is my favorite killer in the game
[3:46:43] <%Ascethetic> Deathslinger is literally skillshot the killer
[3:46:44] <%Garthunox> pat did you see doctors new cosmetic it's so fuckin dope
[3:46:50] <Gutsandlove> well, ghostface is like: nooooo dont look at me
[3:46:50] <Psych_man13_13> Trappers ok
[3:46:52] <%DKDiamantes> To be fair, if I killed @QuietteShy I felt like I played good. If I killed @PatStaresAt it felt like outrunning a two legged dog.
[3:46:57] <josemoya95> Hey pat I'm sure you could Mr 100 and play all the new monsters in one stream with viewers, to prepare for Alatreon
[3:47:08] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> I have yet to play a match against a Myers, and have played against the rest atleast 3 times
[3:47:09] <%arancet> whats his change
[3:47:11] <Doktorhate> what was the change for leatherface?
[3:47:12] <@SoFarFetched> @DKDiamantes Just Tunnel Pat and only Pat LUL
[3:47:15] <Decc> I think PTB opens tomorrow, at least I heard so
[3:47:16] <+Tnick1> I personally Loved PLaying Hillbilly a long time ago
[3:47:19] <%Ascethetic> Im intimidated by Mikey's playstyle
[3:47:26] <Gutsandlove> and mike is: IM HERE
[3:47:33] <%DKDiamantes> @SoFarFetched YOU DONT EVEN NEED TO TUNNEL HIM!
[3:47:36] <%Kaask> shouldnt have switched off console
[3:47:36] <+chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Hearing Pat talk about the meta of a game he enjoys is fun huh
[3:47:37] <Visorak6> Wait what MR is alatreon
[3:47:39] <%ragingbrachy> 91-100 will take a long time monkaS
[3:47:40] <%Daniel_Is_I> Yeup, that's endgame MH
[3:47:44] <%king_wragles> @DKDiamantes wow, way to put down that 2 legged dog. Comparing him to Pat, jeez
[3:47:47] <+Glitchesarecool> Pat play Coral Festival, it'll give you near a whole bar each run and it's easy as hell
[3:47:53] <+Glitchesarecool> Like do one run of it a day
[3:47:55] <Polengoldur> pat could literally be talking about MHW or Warframe and it wouldn't matter which
[3:47:55] <KingVantq> @Visorak6 no one knows until its out
[3:47:58] <rockofan95> Tell wooly I like gundam seed

[3:48:19] <+Glitchesarecool> What just happened?
[3:48:20] <%Agami23> oh god, not the locker hell
[3:48:23] <Meekest> LUL
[3:48:25] <%AnIrishPapaya> What was that?
[3:48:29] <%QuietteShy> this fuckin wallhack move is so fucking strong tho
[3:48:32] <%AnIrishPapaya> oh locker stun
[3:48:35] <%iceballstwitch> head on builds are the funnest
[3:48:35] <BoneofMalkav> cohhAim
[3:48:38] <%LooneyToons8895> that left-hand side camera position is blocking some vital info psaWhat
[3:48:40] <Polengoldur> what if Chris Benoit was in this?
[3:48:42] <%Tyndarian> tripped over a bush
[3:48:42] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> chiazamformerlymankeyfigh subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months, currently on a 2 month streak! Ah almost forgot to resub
[3:48:44] <+wibbwobbler> good streaming pat byye
[3:48:50] <%Agami23> @Glitchesarecool theres a perk that makes leaving lockers work like dropping pallets
[3:48:52] <Meekest> Head On should be basekit tbh 4Head
[3:48:53] <%DKDiamantes> PH does seem super cool doe
[3:48:57] <josemoya95> 10 MR with help and some of the event quest would be 2 hours tops
[3:49:03] <@SoFarFetched> Pyramid Head was like "Becky lemme Smash". But Becky was like "No Lemme Smash YOU"
[3:49:03] <%Cozy90> would chris benoit be a survivor or a villain?
[3:49:18] <%QuietteShy> huntress is still my favorite, i just like throwing axes at people
[3:49:21] <alwayspronking> that's a swear!
[3:49:22] <%ragingbrachy> how the fuck ass
[3:49:23] <%spongeofmystery> Holy shit Pat's got strong peripheral vision
[3:49:23] <%king_wragles> Ya, that fucking hit.
[3:49:26] <+Glitchesarecool> @Agami23 ah. It looked like he just flinched out of nothing
[3:49:27] <CrimsonFox777> "How the fuck ass"
[3:49:28] <%Carpe_Deez_Nuts> How's the level of play in this game on PC vs console?
[3:49:29] <@SoFarFetched> @Agami23 yeah think it's like "Head On" Or something
[3:49:34] <%iceballstwitch> does pat have eyes
[3:49:36] <%king_wragles> RED BARS!
[3:49:41] <+G_Thunders> If Pyramid Head had appeared in Silent HIlls, would people have been hyped or pissed about it?
[3:49:42] <Meekest> FIRE BARREL TECH Pog
[3:49:42] <Ipsenscastle> Wow Pat's terrible today
[3:49:43] <%ragingbrachy> 🔨 moon2S ok

[3:49:50] <Mister_McDerp> pat is throwing
[3:49:51] <%Pookiedaexzile> Ori musta ended early
[3:49:51] <+Glitchesarecool> that is the weirdest noise
[3:49:51] <dauver> big tilt
[3:50:00] <+RowenCleric> Im so glad PH and the silent hill map are good, dude deserves it after all the mistreatment
[3:50:04] <+zzNamttamzz> dont panic, only hit
[3:50:10] <%Pookiedaexzile> Are you losing, Son
[3:50:11] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Are they good or is Pat bad? The age old question
[3:50:17] <@SoFarFetched> @QuietteShy It feels really satisfying when you see a survivor just standing on the other side of the pallet,only to get hit by the ax.
[3:50:18] <%azure22900> Why must survivors be the biggest assholes in any multiplayer game.
[3:50:19] <%iceballstwitch> watching this makes me want to jump on killer but that's a 50/50 chance of making me mad
[3:50:22] <%SvenHolgersson> HRNNNNNNNNNNNG
[3:50:25] <+Loinclothiclese> @Carpe_Deez_Nuts doesnt compare at fucking at all console would get shit on real bad
[3:50:26] <%M3djedx> Nice shot
[3:50:34] <%QuietteShy> @DKDiamantes we really need to stack flashlights next time we play with pat, they seem really fucking good
[3:50:39] <%AnIrishPapaya> @rowencleric That map is so good. Myers is terrifying in it with all of the dark hallways
[3:50:46] <Djinnazz> naw'
[3:50:47] <@SoFarFetched> Yeah High Rank Players use a lot more flashlights.
[3:50:49] <%azure22900> 90/10 chance once you hit past rank 7
[3:50:54] <%Pookiedaexzile> Hoes Mad, but make it horror themed
[3:50:55] <chambatron> What's the smoke to the sides/
[3:50:56] <%ragingbrachy> :)
[3:50:59] <chambatron> ?
[3:50:59] <@SSaryn> Just be good at playing Killer obviously and then you won't be mad Kappa
[3:51:00] <Meekest> And 100% playing Survivor solo
[3:51:01] <ethanjbennett> big dick
[3:51:02] <+Glitchesarecool> yeah just keep blinding him with flashlights, it gets him very tilted
[3:51:03] <%Dementedpenguin> Yeah, I have to be in the right mindset to play Killer. It can easily frustrate.
[3:51:03] <%Mendin> @QuietteShy They just changed a killer perk Lightborne from "Flashlight resistance" to "Flashlight immunity" so
[3:51:03] <%lucidrush> Pat getting bullied?
[3:51:06] <%DKDiamantes> @QuietteShy They also seem to really annoy him - which is way more important to me LUL
[3:51:07] <%king_wragles> So Shy is a monster, turns out. Says me a not butt hurt killer
[3:51:15] <%miabyte> Horde flashlights. Noted.
[3:51:22] <+RowenCleric> @AnIrishPapaya oh damn didnt think of that, havent seen a mikey on that map yet
[3:51:36] <nach8gar> 真情像草原广阔 层层风雨不能阻隔 总有云开 日出时候 万丈阳光照亮你我 真情像梅花开遍 冷冷冰雪不能掩没 就在最冷 枝头绽放 看见春天走向你我 雪花飘飘北风啸啸 天地一片苍茫 一剪寒梅 傲立雪中 只为伊人飘香 爱我所爱无怨无悔 此情长留 心间 雪花飘飘北风啸啸 天地一片苍茫 一剪寒梅 傲立雪中 只为伊人飘香 爱我所爱无怨无悔 此情长留 心间
[3:51:37] <%king_wragles> @Mendin Guess what Pat doesn't run ever?
[3:51:39] <+DoktorZee> flashlights and then double up on battery addons for em
[3:51:40] <@SSaryn> Good ways of flashing the killer are when they're trying to break Pallets btw
[3:51:42] <@SoFarFetched> A friend of mine got a killer salty by using flashlight. Killer ended up going to my friend's steam profile page to leave a comment complaining about her using flashlight and inifniloops LUL
[3:51:43] <%ragingbrachy> ah!!!
[3:51:43] <BoneofMalkav> cohhAim
[3:51:44] <%Cozy90> has pat tried the resident evil survivor thing? i wonder how bad it is
[3:51:45] <%ragingbrachy> WutFace
[3:51:50] <@SSaryn> Or picking people up
[3:51:51] <%iceballstwitch> what is this flashlight night
[3:51:53] <@SoFarFetched> infiniloops*
[3:51:56] <%Pookiedaexzile> What was all theme chex mix letters
[3:51:56] <Djinnazz> CRAZY TALK
[3:51:57] <+DoktorZee> pat u gotta check for other teammates before the pickup
[3:51:57] <%QuietteShy> @Mendin killer will have to sacrifice an entire slot for that tho, which couldve been used for corrupt intervention or something
[3:51:58] <+Glitchesarecool> That seems a little too easy lmao
[3:52:03] <+zzNamttamzz> pro tip
[3:52:06] <Floofiie> New lightborn is gonna be a must have for this dude
[3:52:08] <%ragingbrachy> yep
[3:52:08] <%azure22900> Flash light you
[3:52:10] <%Tyndarian> If you drop the survivor while you're being flashed, you can avoid that
[3:52:12] <%ragingbrachy> thanks pat
[3:52:12] <%Target616> Its always flashlight night
[3:52:14] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> words
[3:52:14] <%Mendin> Yeah Shy but it's Pat vs Your Gang so
[3:52:15] <+walternatorz> I reiterate, pat is broken.
[3:52:16] <astrofalcon1> yes
[3:52:16] <%spongeofmystery> *Mannfred Mann's Blinded By The Light starts playing on loop*

[4:03:42] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> If I met Kool-Aid Man I'd dry him out ON SIGHT
[4:03:42] <%twistedj3ster> Kool Aid Man would be a fun killer

[4:07:47] <%Emperor_Machinus> @terminallyCapriciousz Apperently Ori finished Pat

[4:08:30] <%zamzoph> COWARD

[4:08:49] <%BeezusHrist> WE WANT THE PJSalt though
[4:08:50] <%NeoCre> @warbossmetal He got a complete rework, one of the best killers now
[4:08:53] <%pectusumbra> Curse of the Moon 2 is the same day as well
[4:08:53] <Darknaturexd> only nintendo
[4:08:53] <Shwepie> VR Chat can be trouble for your stream as random people can just run by and try to make use of their N+ Pass.
[4:08:55] <ethanjbennett> Fuck ori, eat cheese
[4:08:56] <karovus> give elmo and all will be forgiven
[4:08:56] <Polengoldur> @PatStaresAt you should make page play dark souls, so you can enjoy someone else being mad
[4:08:58] <%PettyFunk> @LegendGHT We can only hope
[4:08:58] <%iceballstwitch> now go. let the legend come back to life
[4:09:05] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> What else could run it Pat? The Stadia?
[4:09:06] <%Emperor_Machinus> yay
[4:09:13] <%pectusumbra> Also, are you going to cover the devolver event the 11th? Sorry if you already answered
[4:09:14] <%Garthunox> lewd
[4:09:14] <%Jibsoar> Yes, dp2 is a nintendo exclusive
[4:09:16] <$spleekle> No, fuck you :) @ethanjbennett
[4:09:19] <elchupacabra1987> David Cage needs to make a new game/movie
[4:09:23] <%SirGO0SE> Kreygasm
[4:09:24] <seaechiowai> Nagging of the day: Make sure to get an hour of sunlight a day, even if it's just your front porch
[4:09:24] <%ragingbrachy> yeah i know Kreygasm
[4:09:27] <%weissguard> Dispersing at key points sounds about right tbh.
[4:09:29] <%Emperor_Machinus> Pat's ori stream is what made me remove it from my steam wishlist
[4:09:29] <Polengoldur> ... Psycho Mantis should be a killer in this game.
[4:09:34] <%iceballstwitch> only use judgment in dick shapes
[4:09:46] <woodywes13> what do you guys think of pyramid heads corrupt skin
[4:09:55] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> a Metal Gear crossover isn't impossible considering Silent Hill is the same company @Polengoldur
[4:09:56] <ethanjbennett> @spleekle 💔💔💔
[4:10:03] <%QuietteShy> nice
[4:10:03] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> I think Quantic Dream's next game might ACTUALLY be genuinely good, just to surprise us
[4:10:16] <Polengoldur> PH should get a skin where its just him in the nurse outfit
[4:10:19] <%Emperor_Machinus> Make the trail into a mickey mouse shape to summon the greater eldritch horror
[4:10:21] <@SoFarFetched> ooo he's getting to pat LUL
[4:10:22] <%Joustar_> LUL
[4:10:24] <%Cozy90> what does the pointing mean?
[4:10:28] <%iceballstwitch> rough night to be a kill man
[4:10:31] <%Garthunox> TUNNEL HIM
[4:10:36] <+CptDouglasJFalcon> you know that if that dude had a flashlight he'd be clicking the shit out of it
[4:10:36] <Sotetsu> Hey look everyone, it's Pat from PatStaresAt!
[4:10:38] <+Kenzo2000> theres no way this guy is going to be fun to play with
[4:10:46] <%weissguard> Just give us Pyramid Head, but with UwU face on.
[4:10:46] <%iceballstwitch> here comes the 3 gens popping
[4:10:48] <+DynDimAcsiwn> PH should get a skin where he's an ass with legs. Like a large murderous Kirby
[4:10:51] <$spleekle> F...K... IN MY COFFEE?? its more likely than you think
[4:10:52] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> nah i believe in you partok bivouac @PatStaresAt
[4:10:55] <@SoFarFetched> @Cozy90 pointing can be either used for taunting the killer,or when with survivors to point towards objectives and stuff.
[4:10:58] <%Cozy90> oh man its dante from the devil may cry series
[4:11:01] <%ragingbrachy> yes
[4:11:03] <ethanjbennett> 360 no scope

[4:11:11] <%Dementedpenguin> Clicky clicky
[4:11:13] <%Cozy90> @SoFarFetched ooooo ok
[4:11:22] <%terminallyCapriciousz> yes
[4:11:27] <Polengoldur> @spleekle i'm just imagining a giant Forest Kayson in this game now... idk if he'd be a survivor or killer
[4:11:33] <@SoFarFetched> Survivor's also have the beckon emote,for also taunting and/or telling survivors to come over and such.
[4:11:33] <%Emperor_Machinus> gotta be toxic
[4:11:39] <%pectusumbra> oh, yeah, thoughts on that new flashlight perk that showed up in those patch notes or whatever? Become immune to flashlight?
[4:11:42] <%azure22900> Tunnling time woo

[4:12:22] <%Th3SmartAlec> @yargne KILL HIM
[4:12:26] <+Glitchesarecool> so you can fuck up the flashlight activation?
[4:12:29] <%LegendGHT> the voice acting for survivors screaming is so bad
[4:12:33] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:12:39] <%Joustar_> LUL
[4:12:43] <+tinypouf> feels very weird to have this stream as background noise
[4:12:45] <seaechiowai> psaBig LUL
[4:12:46] <%Mendin> Head On hell yeah
[4:12:49] <+BizarroDF> survivor perks lets you heal inside of lockers
[4:12:53] <CandyCoatedConfection> inner strength?
[4:12:54] <%Th3SmartAlec> noice
[4:12:56] <Polengoldur> Edward should be a killer. he could be super fast, but he sparkles whenever he's outside
[4:13:00] <SocialMisfitGamer> psaOrange
[4:13:01] <+BizarroDF> had to be
[4:13:03] <%Mendin> Prob the perk that lets you heal if you cleanse and hide in a locket
[4:13:08] <cipher758> gud
[4:13:10] <%LooneyToons8895> He prolly had inner strength (i.e. locker heal perk)
[4:13:10] <%Th3SmartAlec> LUL
[4:13:10] <woodywes13> @LegendGHT not to mention how fucking loud it is
[4:13:14] <%QuietteShy> if only

[4:26:59] <+Loinclothiclese> RUSSLE THE ORB
[4:27:01] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat finna come back looking like half a orb
[4:27:02] <%ospreyworks> If they were to add an RE monster in as a killer, who would it be?
[4:27:04] <+Loinclothiclese> BREAK UP YOUR SHITS
[4:27:04] <+AWanderingKenku> god this is so gross
[4:27:06] <%ragingbrachy> pat moon2SUFFER
[4:27:10] <@SoFarFetched> @Cozy90 this game just gets weird with survivors,because survivors get pissed at killers for doing what they're supposed to do in the game. Which is kill survivors. But some survivors don't like being the specific target for whatever reasons.
[4:27:12] <+tangoragahn> Do the big mori for streamer clout
[4:27:13] <madskull456> does the cheese power the orb?
[4:27:14] <%PettyFunk> Cut the cheese, heh heh heh
[4:27:15] <%optimasmaximas> StinkyCheese
[4:27:17] <Jormunzilla> Mr X
[4:27:22] <%InugamiTheHound> Is Pat eating more cheese than a rat?
[4:27:23] <@SSaryn> CAKE
[4:27:24] <%trllly> Just curious why you arent currently shitting if you need to so badly?
[4:27:24] <%xWanderingFlame> StinkyCheese
[4:27:24] <%Pookiedaexzile> PAt finna Birth A cheese
[4:27:25] <penitentpentwitch> Ori + Choese = DBD Stream
[4:27:25] <Polengoldur> @ospreyworks probably Mr. X. cuz of memes
[4:27:26] <%Pookiedaexzile> Pat
[4:27:33] <%Joustar_> Pat "Cheeseball" Boivin StinkyCheese
[4:27:33] <woodywes13> Do you guys prefer corrupt intervention or thrilling tremors
[4:27:33] <%ragingbrachy> choese
[4:27:35] <%PettyFunk> The bees live in the holes in the cheese cube
[4:27:36] <+Loinclothiclese> @ospreyworks Most likely it be Nem or MrX
[4:27:36] <%optimasmaximas> cause you ate it pat duh
[4:27:39] <%iceballstwitch> Pat Shits Cheese At
[4:27:40] <%lucidrush> Choese
[4:27:41] <%ShichiNoBushi> Much cake.
[4:27:44] <%SaiyanShoto> “Hey Chat! Wanna see how hard I can eat this cheese?!”
[4:27:48] <%ragingbrachy> someone WILL edit the choese meme to include you
[4:27:57] <%Pookiedaexzile> You've seen Chedda Gief...but have you heard of Chedda Pat
[4:27:59] <bringmecoffeeortea> so can survivors hurt / dmg the killer in this game?
[4:28:00] <%iceballstwitch> correct
[4:28:01] <+Mitchellsocks> Mr X would be a DOPE killer
[4:28:03] <SaltkeyAndAckfish> what's the offering thing chat?
[4:28:08] <+tangoragahn> Cheese Pats At
[4:28:14] <+BizarroDF> thrilling tremors makes it so when you pick up a survivor, all gens that arent being worked on are block off. so it doubles as a slowdown AND map awareness
[4:28:20] <+Loinclothiclese> @bringmecoffeeortea you dont thats not how the game works you can only stun them with something
[4:28:21] <%ssjklyco> You were @ on twitter with the cheese image.
[4:28:27] <%xWanderingFlame> psaBig psaHoldon
[4:28:31] <penitentpentwitch> So 3 panels of Ori dying with Pat stuffing his face in the fourth panel, subtitled by Choese?
[4:28:31] <Jormunzilla> Wesker should be a killer
[4:28:33] <%ragingbrachy> someone edit pat to look like the cheetos cheetah
[4:28:38] <+tangoragahn> 2x Bloodpoints
[4:28:41] <+Loinclothiclese> @bringmecoffeeortea stun or juke those are the tools you have
[4:28:42] <%JJCheeker> It's the summer of pat
[4:28:43] <+tangoragahn> X5
[4:28:49] <%LegendGHT> This map is good for some killers
[4:28:52] <%ospreyworks> If it were Mr. X, what would his gimmick be?
[4:28:55] <%LegendGHT> but mostly shit yeah
[4:28:56] <+tangoragahn> So like 20x bp
[4:28:58] <%iceballstwitch> those car pallets are all gods
[4:29:02] <+gannondaddy> i also hate this map
[4:29:06] <%azure22900> I hate all the street ones they're so shit for killers to navigate or catch up.
[4:29:09] <%InugamiTheHound> pat is dangerous cheesy tonight
[4:29:11] <%optimasmaximas> maybe
[4:29:16] <%Emperor_Machinus> I do not like this map either
[4:29:20] <bringmecoffeeortea> @Loinclothiclese thanks haha never played and I have only seen it through Pat's killer. So I'm assuming the survivors win by "surviving" in a ceratin amount of time?
[4:29:21] <%GameFreakerZero> I spawned literally opposite the killer out in the open road on this map at one point
[4:29:29] <%iceballstwitch> BIG RED MARKS "...is someone here??"
[4:29:40] <woodywes13> @ospreyworks smashing through walls like the cool aid man
[4:29:41] <%Dapper_Cactuar> if they added Candyman to the game what would his gimmick be? Swarms of bees on the map maybe?
[4:29:49] <penitentpentwitch> Yeah, his OS game is strong
[4:29:52] <+tangoragahn> Just surviving at all
[4:29:58] <@commanderclaw> It's like if Huntress could cancel into a throw
[4:29:58] <+The_Butterfly_Man> what do you mean?
[4:29:58] <haisho> I can't believe Pyramid Head is actually a fighting game character
[4:30:01] <+Loinclothiclese> @bringmecoffeeortea activate all gens open big door get out of big door get points for doing various things like healing breaking hooks getting away and so on
[4:30:05] <%ospreyworks> Candyman would be sick
[4:30:09] <CrimsonFox777> @bringmecoffeeortea They have to repair generators, then escape through one of two large doors at the edge of the map. The game can last indefinitely otherwise.
[4:30:12] <%weissguard> Would Gunslinger have one with the gun? Or nah?
[4:30:19] <%Buzzard42> Buzzard42 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! 
[4:30:22] <%Xelig> @haisho whatchu talkin about
[4:30:27] <bringmecoffeeortea> ahhhh okay thanks!
[4:30:31] <KeiPrime> Not gonna lie, I like how casual Pat was just talking right now while putting someone on a meat hook

[4:31:25] <chambatron> Thanks for making the stream a little longer than usual Pat
[4:31:36] <+BizarroDF> PAT
[4:31:42] <%Th3SmartAlec> GASP
[4:31:46] <%optimasmaximas> LUL
[4:31:47] <+tangoragahn> Theres time pressure cuz the longer a game goes the more time the killer has to ya know kill
[4:31:49] <$ssamjangg> are his hands and knife thing made of the same material
[4:31:50] <CrimsonFox777> I'm going to pretend the PridePaint emote is something projectile vomiting a rainbow instead of someone splashing a bucket of paint.
[4:31:54] <%xWanderingFlame> psaPorgmo
[4:32:00] <%iceballstwitch> Pat Stares At but does not see
[4:32:00] <%ospreyworks> Okay, but what if they used William Birkin from RE2 as a killer and he grew more mutated/stronger as the match went on?
[4:32:06] <+Jaysky> Please stop swearing to God in this christian stream streamer man
[4:32:19] <+tangoragahn> Chances of survival drastic go down as teammates die
[4:32:23] <$ssamjangg> he looks like he's made of beef jerky
[4:32:31] <%Th3SmartAlec> But y
[4:32:33] <woodywes13> @ospreyworks like Myers?

[4:33:31] <%Joustar_> losing. With style
[4:33:38] <gsoto83> Burkin should be a killer
[4:33:40] <%Emperor_Machinus> Ori tainted the stream?
[4:33:43] <%ospreyworks> @KeiPrime I actually forgot
[4:33:46] <%optimasmaximas> sorry pat, cant be subbed to a streamer who loses, unsubbed

[4:44:43] <%Emperor_Machinus> @PatStaresAt Did Woolie sneak a pass without you knowkledge Pat?
[4:44:45] <@SoFarFetched> @SSaryn It said "african american streamers and streamers" so I assumed it was towards woolie and pat...but woolie is canadian.
[4:44:50] <%StaceMcGate> But prequel Pat @PatStaresAt
[4:44:51] <%iceballstwitch> perhaps there are more red seeds locations
[4:44:51] <%heartlesshealer> The dog was never caught though
[4:44:53] <%optimasmaximas> fuck
[4:44:57] <%feMC_is_best_girl> Isn't DP2 a prequel?
[4:45:01] <%optimasmaximas> just remembered i gotta watch the old dp lp
[4:45:09] <chll0ne> It was probably supposed to go to woolie
[4:45:11] <%Target616> Wasnt there other red seed cases before the events of dp1?
[4:45:23] <%Jibsoar> @feMC_is_best_girl It is both

[4:46:29] <+OwlLightningMage> Stop using logic and facts to convince Pat to do something. Pat will only do things out of spite or just cause
