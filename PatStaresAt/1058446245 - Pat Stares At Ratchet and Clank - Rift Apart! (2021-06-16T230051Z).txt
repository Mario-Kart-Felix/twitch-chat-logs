[0:13:49] <%twistedj3ster> Blame Jason, not Andy
[0:13:49] <%DorianCreed> @Sasha_conyst Congratulations
[0:13:50] <StarMechV> I thought Jak 2 was when it went EDGE?
[0:13:50] <%NovaKnightmare> Jak and Daxter died forever because of Fuckmann btw
[0:13:51] <%jackythefrost> Ja X is great tho
[0:13:51] <+IxDomxI> uh, deadlocked?
[0:13:52] <iosephe> ow
[0:13:53] <%chance_h> Jack X Chaos
[0:13:53] <+NickHatesSnow> Jak 2 was the edge tho
[0:13:54] <%cvp5127> jak 2 was the edge started
[0:13:55] <%mrsnakeyogirl> I miss jak:(
[0:13:55] <%ssjklyco> Jak X was a racer
[0:13:58] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Jak X was a decent racing game
[0:13:58] <Ashrox117> Platinum trophied the PS4 one a few weeks ago. Took 3 playthroughs, I don’t know why I did it to myself
[0:13:58] <%Faustgesicht> Is a catboy and a robet. good times
[0:13:59] <%AzureGale> Edgy kart racer was rare back in the day
[0:14:00] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I have only played the Daxter psp game
[0:14:00] <%BarujaraciGaming> Jak 3 was fun imo
[0:14:01] <SlangPunk> Those ps2 games had a little edge, as a treat
[0:14:01] <+zuzuxiv> deadlocked was super good tho too
[0:14:03] <ScreamLord> The Jak PSP game is what killed the series
[0:14:04] <%MisterRockett> No it wasn't
[0:14:05] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> jak 2 is the edge lmao @patstaresat
[0:14:10] <%Sasha_conyst> jak x was an interesting game
[0:14:11] <%Dakuu75> everyone is ALWYAS shocked that Pat is a R&C fan
[0:14:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> Embrace the Edge
[0:14:13] <%SpontaneousC> Jak 2 was edge, Jak 3 dropped the edge and decided to be mad max which was pretty sick
[0:14:14] <%Monkeyweed21> jak 3 is the best jak
[0:14:17] <pmaratsuper> "I'm going to kill Praxis!"
[0:14:18] <%doc_ock_rokc> Pat...Rachet and clank Deadlocked
[0:14:20] <%zeroarturia> Congrats Sasha!
[0:14:20] <%bugz_munny> Crack in Time was awesome
[0:14:20] <%AzureGale> You're gonna like this one. I guarantee it.
[0:14:21] <%The_Protagonist> Rumplestein and Crunk
[0:14:22] <ScreamLord> Correction the BAD PSP game
[0:14:24] <+Pendlez> none of the ps3 ones
[0:14:25] <$Ziegsy> @Ashrox117 I did that too! very fun three days
[0:14:25] <viewtifulr> the age of time was grit or no game
[0:14:26] <derap41> so the good ones
[0:14:27] <dan_g_v> time to play them all, I guess
[0:14:31] <+MidnightBurst12> fair
[0:14:33] <%AzureGale> Up Your Arsenal best game in the series
[0:14:35] <$SGrim> I played religiously until "Going Commando"
[0:14:36] <%DianaTheAscian> So like most people then
[0:14:37] <%sakeydo> ditto
[0:14:37] <The_UnfathoMarble> what's your story been with insomnia
[0:14:37] <%JoshManVGH> Ok so the good trilogy.
[0:14:39] <%jackythefrost> Jak 3 is still my favorite, going full mad max was AWESOME
[0:14:40] <%CoffeeKaiju> Up your Arsenal was my fave
[0:14:43] <+Valtorias> deadlocked was all I played and really liked it.
[0:14:44] <avidneptune> There’s more PS3 Ratchet games than PS2 Ratchet games
[0:14:44] <derap41> YEs
[0:14:45] <%bugz_munny> Crack in Time
[0:14:45] <Aeroallways> did you ever play the ps3 ones?
[0:14:45] <SlangPunk> Ah yes, the classics
[0:14:45] <%mrsnakeyogirl> I remember going commando and deadlocked
[0:14:46] <derap41> no
[0:14:48] <$StrawberryPantsu> No
[0:14:48] <%HunguyTV> @Ashrox117 the disco trophy was hairpulling for me x|
[0:14:48] <%AzureGale> YES
[0:14:49] <ScreamLord> Yes
[0:14:50] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Size Matters, A Clank in Time, and PS4 for me
[0:14:50] <%derpy_platypus> idk
[0:14:50] <%VvTacoSaladvV> VvTacoSaladvV subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! 
[0:14:50] <%ssjklyco> Yeah
[0:14:50] <StarlitStunner> Some of them
[0:14:50] <DracaenaLeaf> there's only 1 ps4 one
[0:14:50] <%bugz_munny> 100%
[0:14:51] <+Mintios> sure
[0:14:51] <%Sasha_conyst> I have played all but the most recent on the PS4
[0:14:51] <reonome> nah
[0:14:52] <%sakeydo> probably
[0:14:52] <%valriot> Crack In Time is REALLY good
[0:14:52] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> play the OGs
[0:14:52] <%twistedj3ster> yeah, they work
[0:14:52] <$daveronald> there ok
[0:14:52] <KahnWick> no
[0:14:53] <majindusto> YES
[0:14:53] <%machshop> i only played the PS2 ones
[0:14:53] <+SocialMisfitGamer> yes
[0:14:53] <+IxDomxI> PS4 one has nothing to do with this game
[0:14:53] <Aeroallways> yes
[0:14:53] <StarMechV> PS4? No PS3? Maybe
[0:14:53] <%Mrbaconator> all the old ratchet and clank games are amazing
[0:14:54] <+johnnychopsocky> Why is anyone surprised Pat likes R&C?  It embraces the power of GUN like few other games
[0:14:54] <papertoonz1414> PS3 ones are better
[0:14:54] <RayCSmooth> Probably gonna feel like shit after this
[0:14:54] <bob900000> kinda
[0:14:55] <%SpontaneousC> The ps3 ones were good the ps4 ones not so much
[0:14:55] <$SGrim> They're 7/10 at best
[0:14:55] <%bugz_munny> Crack in time
[0:14:55] <%ssjklyco> They all are good
[0:14:56] <+NickHatesSnow> PS3 yes, PS4 meh
[0:14:56] <+Pendlez> there's only one ps4 one right
[0:14:56] <Warbot40> ps4? eh
[0:14:56] <Ashrox117> @ziegsy It’s surprising how short it is when you rush through it
[0:14:56] <%HunguyTV> PS4 one was alright
[0:14:56] <+fugatlas> crack in time is arguably one of the best, tools of destruction is okay
[0:14:57] <Profmcstevie> Sure
[0:14:57] <Luckster1234> yes
[0:14:57] <+brightman42> PS3 ones rather
[0:14:57] <$StrawberryPantsu> The remake is meh
[0:14:57] <%Dfreddy8> MAYBE
[0:14:57] <derap41> Play the PS2 ones
[0:14:58] <+NeonLight> Theyre average at worst
[0:14:58] <tj_baha> 00%
[0:14:58] <NanoHologuise> PS4 one is great but the story is ass, ps3 ones are great
[0:14:58] <+SolidusRex> Play the PS3 ones
[0:14:58] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> no
[0:14:58] <pmaratsuper> Crack in Time is really good
[0:14:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Reboot one sucks
[0:14:59] <%DianaTheAscian> @PatStaresAt they're meh
[0:14:59] <%KeiganOfAstora> no
[0:15:00] <Vikbosss> CHAOS
[0:15:00] <Warbot40> PS3 yes
[0:15:00] <%toolofparanoia> Why not!
[0:15:01] <+Stormzcales_Lair> yes this takes place after that PS4 1
[0:15:01] <Nordguy> eeh
[0:15:01] <theanora1> it was okay
[0:15:02] <Zeif00> ehhh
[0:15:02] <%valriot> No theres 3
[0:15:02] <+Dumple_Roe> it's good, but no
[0:15:03] <%KeiganOfAstora> PS3 yes, PS4 no
[0:15:04] <%MisterRockett> YES
[0:15:04] <+Mrkel90> rac ps4 is meh but ps3 are good
[0:15:04] <%sabertoothzombie> PS3
[0:15:05] <PanicSwytch> No
[0:15:05] <$manwithboxonhead> ehhh
[0:15:05] <$Ziegsy> the free one we got was just an updated one it was good fun
[0:15:06] <%Mrbaconator> the previous games are really good
[0:15:07] <KahnWick> PS2 Era is the best ones
[0:15:08] <%jackythefrost> The 2016 reboot is bad
[0:15:08] <Ashrox117> I enjoyed it
[0:15:08] <%amilie3> no
[0:15:09] <mesamus> ps4 is a garbage movie tie-in
[0:15:09] <derap41> play the OG ones
[0:15:09] <tj_baha> 100%**
[0:15:09] <%chiluzza> do whatever you want were not your real dad
[0:15:09] <%BarujaraciGaming> the remake was fun
[0:15:10] <%ballzxxtoxxyou> Yes
[0:15:10] <%Monkeyweed21> Crack in Time is the previous good one
[0:15:11] <%Dakuu75> The ones from the PS3 era are good.
[0:15:11] <%mrsnakeyogirl> PS4 ones?
[0:15:11] <%valriot> THERES 4 GAMES ON PS4
[0:15:11] <Psyramics> they vary in quality
[0:15:12] <SlangPunk> PS4 one is ass unfortunately
[0:15:12] <bob900000> it's ok
[0:15:12] <%cvp5127> its fine
[0:15:13] <AthenaAegis> Asking chat again? What could go wrong? Kappa
[0:15:13] <%ssjklyco> It was fine
[0:15:13] <dan_g_v> oh, that settles it
[0:15:14] <+brightman42> the ps3 games hold up
[0:15:15] <%Sasha_conyst> yes
[0:15:16] <%bugz_munny> Crack in Time is fuckin awesome
[0:15:16] <%KeiganOfAstora> PS4 GAME IS A MOVIE REBOOT TIE-IN
[0:15:17] <%JoshManVGH> The one PS4 one was a remake of thr PS2 one and it was fun but not as good.
[0:15:18] <Zeif00> I would watch some vids on it
[0:15:18] <%BarujaraciGaming> no it doesnt suck, it was fine
[0:15:20] <%KeiganOfAstora> FUCK THE REBOOT
[0:15:22] <StarlitStunner> Yup
[0:15:22] <avidneptune> PS3 ones good
[0:15:22] <tj_baha> PS4 one is great
[0:15:23] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Never played ps3 ones
[0:15:23] <%machshop> yep you did
[0:15:23] <%AzureGale> ok
[0:15:23] <%KeiganOfAstora> JUST PLAY THE PS3 GAMES
[0:15:24] <+IxDomxI> PS4 one is a reboot, this one is a continuation of ps3 storylines
[0:15:24] <%VvTacoSaladvV> I was gonna play it with the PS4 but everyone said that one was bad
[0:15:25] <%toolofparanoia> mixed opinion chat
[0:15:26] <%Dakuu75> The PS2 era is definately the best @PatStaresAt
[0:15:27] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Reboot was ok
[0:15:28] <Warbot40> Crack in Time is great
[0:15:28] <+NickHatesSnow> PS3 is the bst wtf?
[0:15:28] <%chance_h> Play all of them in alphabetical order
[0:15:28] <%KeiganOfAstora> yea
[0:15:30] <derap41> Reboot is shit
[0:15:30] <%KeiganOfAstora> PS2 is the best
[0:15:31] <Aeroallways> reboot one gameplay is good but story is meh
[0:15:33] <majindusto> Play everything  but the REBOOT
[0:15:34] <pmaratsuper> Except for Crack in Time
[0:15:34] <%AzureGale> PS4 one is fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine
[0:15:34] <+johnnychopsocky> PS4 game plays good.  The story is scenes from the movie
[0:15:36] <+fugatlas> deadlock also *exists*
[0:15:38] <%Monkeyweed21> Crack in Time is fantastic
[0:15:38] <randoli_spugoli> they're all good imo, but none of them should majorly relevant
[0:15:40] <%sabertoothzombie> Future series is great
[0:15:40] <Profmcstevie> 1 2 3 and Deadlocked are generally considered the solid games
[0:15:40] <derap41> 1-4 are best
[0:15:41] <+MooseIsGoose> Yup
[0:15:46] <%toolofparanoia> 2 generations!
[0:15:48] <+Mintios> @PatStaresAt PS3 ones are still 8.5/10 games
[0:15:49] <+brightman42> this one is pretty great
[0:15:49] <$StrawberryPantsu> Just hit the HD switch on your PS2 Dingus
[0:15:50] <+D00msDayDan> play them in the woolie order, pincering towards the middle
[0:15:52] <Warbot40> Tools of Destruction is eh, Crack in Time is one of the best
[0:15:53] <%JoshManVGH> Yeah this one could easily come after 3 or 5 I guess.
[0:15:54] <%Dfreddy8> ******
[0:15:54] <majindusto> PAT NO
[0:15:54] <theanora1> I feel like skipping the PS3 was a good choice
[0:15:55] <bob900000> none of them are really bad
[0:15:56] <%HunguyTV> PS4 feels slightly reduntant after Rift Apart since it was very "meh" but had great visuals
[0:15:56] <%Dakuu75> I hate all the stilted Fall Out looking dialogue int he remakes
[0:15:58] <%MidnightBurst12> Good job doing absolutely nothing
[0:16:01] <%Monkeyweed21> you missed Crack in Time tho
[0:16:03] <Vex_Machina> SMRT
[0:16:05] <Aeroallways> I'd argue A Crack in Time is one of the beest
[0:16:06] <+fugatlas> crack in time is legit fantastic, and also a really good insight into what happens when a character dynamic is built around always being together and then you have a game where they're lost
[0:16:08] <dan_g_v> Young Patrick beat the internet chat of the Future
[0:16:08] <%JoshManVGH> I never played the PS4 ones and it worked out.
[0:16:09] <avidneptune> This one follows the plot of the PS3 ones
[0:16:16] <KahnWick> @fugatlas Deadlocked is like right next to Going Commando as the best in the franchise
[0:16:16] <%derpy_platypus> Shepard 2
[0:16:18] <%JoshManVGH> ps3 ones
[0:16:29] <%toolofparanoia> its literally nothing until we see gameplay
[0:16:31] <%valriot> Liara has wrickles, making it at least 400 years in the future
[0:16:33] <%Dfreddy8> UMMMM
[0:16:34] <+SolidusRex> PS3 ones are good except for the four player game and the tower defense game
[0:16:35] <ScreamLord> @PatStaresAt The PS3 games were still very good and the had a lot of world building around the Lombaxes and Clank
[0:16:39] <+SocialMisfitGamer> (Caps Warning) THERE'S A NEW MONSTER'S INC MOVIE
[0:16:40] <dan_g_v> Did Pat see that there is going to be new River City Girls games in the future?
[0:16:43] <+D00msDayDan> NO SPOILERS
[0:16:45] <%ape_hawk> Wrex Shepard
[0:16:49] <%toolofparanoia> TURIAN SHEPARD
[0:16:50] <%The_Protagonist> i mean, that'd be great
[0:16:51] <Bigyanno> Shepard with 4 balls
[0:16:52] <+NeonLight> "Krogan." "Wrex."
[0:16:53] <%RAGING_1NF3RNO> @patstaresat Did you ever get that upgrade that you missed in ME2?
[0:16:54] <+Ches_Neckbeard> Shepards asari daughters
[0:16:54] <%Ranryu692> isn't this just the plot to Jurassic World?
[0:16:56] <Ashrox117> Four ball sheperd
[0:16:56] <Mrrccava> wtf why is that such a good idea.
[0:16:56] <+johnnychopsocky> R&C embraces the power of GUN like few other games
[0:16:57] <Profmcstevie> Yes, "oh no" krogan shepard
[0:16:59] <%cvp5127> shepard shepard
[0:16:59] <$StrawberryPantsu> What is the race that Liara is?
[0:17:00] <+TopTieramisu> pansexual shepard
[0:17:00] <wolfen091> thats really dumb
[0:17:01] <%Dakuu75> Is Crack in Time the last one before this-one. story wise? Like... the Cragmites defeat and the dimensionator is broke and Ratchet was like, "Oh no, the lombax dimension~"
[0:17:02] <%AzureGale> You mean ASARI SHEPARD
[0:17:02] <oozebear> Krogan Sheopard fucks his way across space with his four mighty balls
[0:17:03] <$StrawberryPantsu> Squid heads?
[0:17:06] <%derpy_platypus> asari shepard is XTRA horny
[0:17:06] <%Frost_Quill> Quarian Shep.
[0:17:06] <+D00msDayDan> shepard with 4 balls
[0:17:06] <%Ipsenscastle> Why do you play with squad moves on automatic, you're missing half the gameplay
[0:17:07] <RayCSmooth> Soo just add race selection then...
[0:17:08] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt fuck it. Shepard had sex with a Krogan, and you play as Shepard's super-spawn
[0:17:08] <%doc_ock_rokc> PLAY 3 ONLINE
[0:17:08] <StarlitStunner> Vorcha Shepard!
[0:17:09] <%MugenSandan> Not an ELCOR
[0:17:12] <%bugz_munny> Wrex. Wrex Shepard.
[0:17:12] <$StrawberryPantsu> Asari
[0:17:13] <avidneptune> PS3 had 6 Ratchet’s
[0:17:13] <%Monkeyweed21> VOLUS SHEPHARD
[0:17:14] <%ape_hawk> you want to play the elcor, dont lie
[0:17:14] <%SpontaneousC> You could play Krogans and Turians in the multiplayer of 3! That they didnt bring back
[0:17:16] <+NeonLight> RIP ME3 Multiplayer
[0:17:17] <+SocialMisfitGamer> False alarm it's a series
[0:17:18] <%The_Protagonist> incoming Crazy Talk Requiem where we get a Mass Effect MMO
[0:17:19] <%SpontaneousC> which was the only good part of three
[0:17:19] <Ashrox117> Then you should be salty about ME3 multiplayer not coming back
[0:17:20] <$StrawberryPantsu> Volus shepard
[0:17:25] <Zeif00> No humans
[0:17:25] <majindusto> Pat refuses  to go back to PS3 cause  he's  a COWARD enigmaKEK
[0:17:31] <avidneptune> Half of them are good
[0:17:39] <%Dfreddy8> VORCHA SHEPARD
[0:17:40] <%Ipsenscastle> fair enough!
[0:17:42] <KahnWick> then you'll love ME3 Multi-player if the bring it back @patstaresat
[0:17:42] <pmaratsuper> I personally want Control ending to be canon. I want Robo Jesus Shepard.
[0:17:50] <Mrrccava> cause thats the half that's bad
[0:17:54] <%ansterdamn> what if shepard canonically got liara prego and you play their child in the new game?
[0:17:57] <+Ches_Neckbeard> if you have base ME3 you can still boot up the multiplayer. the lobbies are a little slow and you'll need to scumbag your way through soem lootboxes to be good
[0:18:10] <%sick_kickflips> sick_kickflips subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months! Randomly remembered the time I worked at gamestop and a guy bought RE4 HD and then returned it the same day because it wasn't enough like RE6.
[0:18:15] <The_Mcmuffin> isnt it on ps4
[0:18:17] <Gorshum> LUL
[0:18:20] <SaltyAzteca> Its a win win!
[0:18:23] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'll buy a PS5 next tax season
[0:18:24] <+D00msDayDan> @Ches_Neckbeard by scumbag you need cheat engine right?
[0:18:27] <jorniev> HOW MUCH is this game?
[0:18:29] <%Monkeyweed21> @pmaratsuper just say that Shephard freed the geth from Control and then flew every Reaper into a black hole
[0:18:32] <%Ipsenscastle> I will vicariously experience the PS5 through you for the next two years
[0:18:33] <+D00msDayDan> i meant mean not need but w/e
[0:18:33] <banirakohi> CHAOS?
[0:18:34] <$MetalPanic> why won't they remaster Deadlocked
[0:18:34] <DracaenaLeaf> LUL
[0:18:37] <DjFrostBite95> Chaos
[0:18:40] <%sick_kickflips> CHAOS
[0:18:41] <+Mintios> Is it good
[0:18:41] <%derpy_platypus> Let us vicariously play the game through you puppet man

[0:18:44] <SlangPunk> I got my Ps5 today! It’s so fucking big

[0:18:47] <rei0> nice
[0:18:48] <jorniev> WOW
[0:18:50] <$StrawberryPantsu> It's Nioh 2.5
[0:18:50] <avidneptune> They did remaster deadlocked on PS3
[0:18:51] <%bugz_munny> chaos is good
[0:18:51] <+Ches_Neckbeard> @Ches_Neckbeard Pat has never been above spending so much money on loot boxes
[0:18:51] <LoreKeeper_Thal> IT SURE IS
[0:18:51] <%Dfreddy8> I Probably will buy a 4k tv before a new system
[0:18:52] <%CalderGaming> interesting.
[0:18:52] <iosephe> CHAOS?
[0:18:53] <rytisone> is shirt man still shirt man?
[0:18:54] <RaidenRising> CHAOS
[0:18:54] <Dabrikishaw> The E3 Promo made the game look BAD
[0:18:56] <BappoTheMighty> I knew it!
[0:18:56] <%Mr_Pylon> Nioh 3 basically right?
[0:18:57] <Profmcstevie> It seemed kinda lost
[0:18:57] <+D00msDayDan> not even ff origins, it's just chaos now
[0:18:59] <StarMechV> C H A O S
[0:18:59] <+johnnychopsocky> When Andromeda came out, I was on a Payday 2 kick, so I eat thinking about a Mass Effect game where you did Space Heists
[0:19:00] <bob900000> yeah
[0:19:00] <KahnWick> the $89.99 CAD price tag is why I'm not playing it, Like wtf Sony.
[0:19:01] <+DaltonForrest> It's got promise but it need a lot of work
[0:19:03] <Blank9> the built in blue magic rules
[0:19:04] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Word
[0:19:06] <+cade_calrayn> It just needs visual polish, yeah
[0:19:09] <Louie_Salmon> Yeah it's a PS4 game so it won't be a looke4
[0:19:11] <RaidenRising> BUT CHAOD
[0:19:12] <%DianaTheAscian> It looks horrible visually
[0:19:12] <%BallerSwagBro9k> FF14 is also ugly tho
[0:19:14] <$StrawberryPantsu> Nioh 1 and 2 arent the best looking games either tbh
[0:19:14] <%JoshManVGH> The job system is a lot of fun! incremental downstream EXP across multiple jobs!
[0:19:14] <Louie_Salmon> looker*
[0:19:15] <+RowenCleric> thats what max said too
[0:19:20] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Ps2 game
[0:19:24] <%derpy_platypus> makes your eyes hurt
[0:19:26] <$StrawberryPantsu> It's bland
[0:19:30] <+NeonLight> It has anti-color
[0:19:30] <Psyramics> a bold departure for a FF game
[0:19:31] <dan_g_v> sounds cool
[0:19:32] <tigeruppercut1226> @Louie_Salmon Its a PS5 game
[0:19:33] <%Ipsenscastle> It's super unappealing to look at
[0:19:35] <%pilgrimsayswhat> just got here what game are we talking about
[0:19:36] <+Zayasu> why though
[0:19:37] <ScreamLord> Is the gameplay good at least?
[0:19:38] <BappoTheMighty> Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[0:19:38] <%valriot> Yeah but its cool
[0:19:43] <%DakotaMacDoodle> I'm sure the graphic will get juiced by release
[0:19:45] <Profmcstevie> How did THESE TWO DEVELOPERS make ugly
[0:19:46] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Grey
[0:19:47] <%Mr_Pylon> looked kinda washed out
[0:19:49] <%pilgrimsayswhat> oh ffo
[0:19:50] <%Ipsenscastle> it has strong 'brown shooter' energy
[0:19:50] <pmaratsuper> But plays great
[0:19:51] <%CoffeeKaiju> @pilgrimsayswhat CHAOS
[0:19:52] <+TopTieramisu> you know why it looks bad? because CHAOS
[0:19:53] <%derpy_platypus> perfect Next-Gen game
[0:19:54] <Mrrccava> what we talkin about? CHAOS?
[0:19:55] <%jackythefrost> Its still very clearly in Alpha so I'll give them a pass for now, Nioh 1 also wasnt great in its Alpha looks wise
[0:19:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> I'm excited to play it when it hits PC,but It looks very bland
[0:20:00] <Louie_Salmon> @tigeruppercut1226 And also a ps4 game, despite the demo being ps5 only
[0:20:03] <+zzNamttamzz> It probably needs pushed back to make it look better
[0:20:03] <jorniev> STILL SOMEHOW ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE GAMES OF E3
[0:20:05] <avidneptune> Looks like an early PS3/360 game art style wise
[0:20:10] <%pilgrimsayswhat> @pilgrimsayswhat C H O A S
[0:20:11] <%valriot> Its not Dark Souls, for fuck sake
[0:20:13] <+Zayasu> And I was excited when I heard the rumors FeelsBadMan
[0:20:16] <%mrsnakeyogirl> I’m still kinda hyped tbh
[0:20:20] <derap41> was  the whole Kill Chaos Ironic
[0:20:32] <%McSoliace> nioh is the word
[0:20:37] <%derpy_platypus> furry bait
[0:20:39] <%Monkeyweed21> is Anji Mito a Shoto?
[0:20:41] <%Dakuu75> Damn right
[0:20:42] <+BIumen> the loading is mind-blowing
[0:20:42] <%Faustgesicht> How's Jack's personality
[0:20:43] <%DianaTheAscian> I've heard good things
[0:20:45] <+johnnychopsocky> The loading is SO FAST
[0:20:49] <%twistedj3ster> they were great
[0:20:50] <%Dakuu75> doodBro
[0:20:51] <%PocketBearIllustrator> I know it's just a spin off, but I don't know why the protag's characters design is so bland compared to the other two characters.
[0:20:52] <%Ipsenscastle> I liked the 2016 game, but the only other one I played was the original
[0:20:52] <ScreamLord> Going Commando was my favorite
[0:20:52] <jorniev> HOW much is this game?
[0:20:53] <Mrrccava> yeah weird that it's only a ps5 demo when it looks like a launch game for ps4
[0:20:54] <wujak> ratchet is sonys best franchise
[0:20:54] <%valriot> Crack In Time is really good
[0:21:01] <+johnnychopsocky> Loading up a save game is nearly instant
[0:21:03] <%The_Protagonist> Pat did you see SMTV allows you to have a partner demon follow you around in the open world? Who will you have follow you around and why is it Mara?
[0:21:08] <+Mintios> The whole franchise is consistenly good
[0:21:11] <%Ipsenscastle> Bring back Jak & Daxter
[0:21:13] <+NickHatesSnow> the ps3 ones have the best gameplay
[0:21:14] <jorniev> what is the price of this game?
[0:21:15] <%mrsnakeyogirl> The dimension gimmick actually works really well in rift apart
[0:21:22] <avidneptune> Tools, Crack, and Nexus are worth playing
[0:21:22] <knight_verse> Can't wait for you to change your mind on FF Origins as soon as someone on Twitter praises it.
[0:21:23] <SaltyAzteca> YEYEYEYEYEYE
[0:21:28] <SaltyAzteca> HE DID THE THING
[0:21:33] <jorniev> thank god
[0:21:39] <rytisone> thanks goblins
[0:21:40] <jorniev> GOOOD OL PAT
[0:21:44] <$SGrim> @The_Protagonist If SMTV let's you romance a demon partner, who would you chose, and why is it Matador?
[0:21:44] <%CoffeeKaiju> lmao
[0:21:45] <SaltyAzteca> Ahahahahaha
[0:21:47] <%derpy_platypus> legel cheating
[0:21:56] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> fuck playing fair.
[0:21:56] <%DianaTheAscian> Did you beat Garland in the demo btw? I know Max spent a min on it
[0:21:57] <Dunmarkh> based cheating
[0:21:58] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Wow...
[0:21:59] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> but for real though
[0:22:01] <jorniev> JUST CHEAT
[0:22:02] <Profmcstevie> Take that EA, patch out MY fucking credit bonus
[0:22:04] <+saintandrew92> literally just arrived and I hear "I used a cheat engine..."
[0:22:05] <%Dfreddy8> You'll still miss some anyway probably.
[0:22:06] <%Monkeyweed21> BIG BABY GO CHEAT BRR
[0:22:07] <%sick_kickflips> if you ain't cheating you ain't pat
[0:22:13] <theanora1> I can't believe you cheated yourself and the game
[0:22:15] <$Futurecity10> Then play andromeda
[0:22:16] <Dabrikishaw> I plan to do some legal cheating of my own when Save Wizard updates
[0:22:16] <+allups> dont say that
[0:22:16] <farrellcityking> A real shitlord
[0:22:18] <derap41> I want a TV series
[0:22:19] <+NohbdyIsCrash> Oh don't worry, it won't
[0:22:19] <$Futurecity10> Andromeda is mediocre
[0:22:21] <RayCSmooth> Just play Andromeda then
[0:22:23] <rytisone> Andromeda was mediocre
[0:22:23] <%Ranryu692> 3 might scratch that itch LUL
[0:22:25] <ScreamLord> All I want is race options
[0:22:26] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Pat Shepard used his offshore bank accounts
[0:22:27] <iosephe> do not say that
[0:22:28] <%Monkeyweed21> ANDROMEDA 2
[0:22:30] <derap41> Andromeda is mediocre
[0:22:30] <%Pandybun> Me too Pat...me too
[0:22:31] <%valriot> Andromeda is mediocre
[0:22:31] <%Ipsenscastle> let me talk to battletoads in space goddamnit
[0:22:32] <+johnnychopsocky> I mean Andromeda is right there
[0:22:34] <%valriot> Yes it is
[0:22:34] <$Ziegsy> ziegsyEyes then perish
[0:22:37] <Sapphire_Breeze> it's funny
[0:22:38] <SaltyAzteca> LUL
[0:22:39] <%sick_kickflips> It's worth playing once
[0:22:39] <%The_Protagonist> Andromeda is trash
[0:22:39] <%JoshManVGH> Bring back Dark Energy Storyline!
[0:22:40] <ARobotFromtheFuture1> Andromeda 2
[0:22:41] <%derpy_platypus> Andromeda story doodoo
[0:22:42] <$Futurecity10> Its not THAT bad
[0:22:42] <jorniev> ITS SADLY BAD
[0:22:46] <%valriot> Ok but you think good games are bad
[0:22:49] <+allups> sonic is in it tho
[0:22:49] <%BallerSwagBro9k> My face is tired
[0:22:49] <%sabertoothzombie> it is mediocre
[0:22:50] <%Frost_Quill> I love ME's worldbuilding.  It's one of the few sci-fi games where it'd be sick to just LIVE in the world.
[0:22:51] <The_Mcmuffin> i wanna try andromeda at least
[0:22:52] <%Monkeyweed21> IT IS THE DEFINITION OF MEDIOCRE
[0:22:54] <+summer_volta> i like it more than 1 or 3 i think
[0:22:54] <%mrsnakeyogirl> So much potential
[0:22:57] <%Mrbaconator> boo that man
[0:22:57] <Sapphire_Breeze> so... not bad enough
[0:22:58] <%twistedj3ster> ew
[0:22:58] <jorniev> WOW
[0:22:59] <%Dakuu75> *vomit*
[0:23:01] <%Ipsenscastle> Andromeda's crime is that it's BORING
[0:23:01] <%Pandybun> What
[0:23:01] <jorniev> WOOOOOW
[0:23:02] <Virokwet> its more mid than bad. most of teh bugs have been patched
[0:23:02] <+BIumen> what year was that
[0:23:03] <stantheman_97> WHAT
[0:23:04] <tanarath> Andromeda has good combat with meh story, they patched it, ask max
[0:23:04] <%DianaTheAscian> OH BOY
[0:23:05] <%The_Protagonist> @valriot literally nobody thinks Andromeda is good
[0:23:06] <BigFingerRo> I seem to remember andromeda got EXTRA SCRIPT patched in
[0:23:07] <avidneptune> It’s just boring
[0:23:07] <derap41> its not bad its worse its mediocre
[0:23:07] <jorniev> THAT ONE HURT
[0:23:07] <+Dumple_Roe> ......
[0:23:07] <PanicSwytch> Burn that man
[0:23:08] <ScreamLord> Thro him out the airlock
[0:23:09] <gslayer14> ! C U R S E D !
[0:23:10] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> don't let it set in
[0:23:10] <+saintandrew92> this hotdog is on the floor, why not eat it? - Andromeda
[0:23:12] <+brightman42> that man was broken
[0:23:13] <+pkmamsters> man knows waht he wants
[0:23:14] <LoreKeeper_Thal> that pause LUL
[0:23:14] <rytisone> sometimes you just wanna play a bad game
[0:23:15] <%sick_kickflips> He said I should warn people in the future
[0:23:17] <Louie_Salmon> What are these Andromeda apologists, how much do they pay you people
[0:23:18] <%Dfreddy8> ONE GUY
[0:23:19] <%Pandybun> People like that exist?
[0:23:22] <%king_wragles> This kills the Pat
[0:23:23] <bob900000> that's so crazy that I don't know if I believe it
[0:23:25] <SaltyAzteca> Customer is always right
[0:23:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat is trying not to scream
[0:23:27] <+johnnychopsocky> Andromeda has Vetra.  Vetra makes Andromeda better
[0:23:28] <jorniev> BOOO THAT MAN
[0:23:28] <+Valtorias> why did he work there then?
[0:23:29] <DomPressesButtons> wuy?
[0:23:32] <%mrsnakeyogirl> That guy is just wrong
[0:23:38] <SlangPunk> Wow thats… wow
[0:23:43] <%ElkRiverDog> That guy is the reason we can’t have nice things
[0:23:48] <%Frost_Quill> Andromeda got a few things right, female Turian crewmate being one of them.
[0:23:50] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> nice
[0:23:50] <derap41> Good back seating there
[0:23:51] <%Ipsenscastle> whyyyyyyy
[0:23:53] <Virokwet> Andromeda is not a good fix for a MAss effect itch in my opinion.
[0:23:54] <%NovaKnightmare> good advice
[0:23:56] <dan_g_v> oof
[0:23:58] <SaltyAzteca> gatdamn it DMCA
[0:24:00] <%Ipsenscastle> why do they do this in this day and age
[0:24:04] <Sapphire_Breeze> @SaltyAzteca is a RE4 hater really a customer?
[0:24:04] <%Ynkubus_> ffs really?
[0:24:05] <PanicSwytch> I worked at a game store and a guy complained why the RE games are not like the movies
[0:24:06] <%twistedj3ster> the fact we have to have warnings like this is bullshit, I'm so sick of it
[0:24:08] <ScreamLord> Fuck the music industry
[0:24:08] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Great advice!!!!
[0:24:09] <%Faustgesicht> Ardolas?
[0:24:10] <%ssjklyco> I don't know, I heard a licensse song "SO HAPPYTOGETHER"

[0:24:14] <%DianaTheAscian> prob the ladder
[0:24:16] <avidneptune> It’s a cutscene

[0:27:08] <devanmuse> It's NOT just you actually. Every R&C title is a dirty pun
[0:27:09] <knight_verse> How much do you want to bet that Loki will get replaced by the end of the series?
[0:27:10] <%Monkeyweed21> @KahnWick Metallica vs. Napster is considered the reason the DMCA is so draconian as it essentially destroyed the concept of fair use

[0:29:13] <+GigaBoots> @PatStaresAt Nah, that was it changing to performance RT, so it's 120Hz now if your setup supports it. Your capture card will likely nerf that to 1080p 120Hz though.
[0:29:15] <%Ipsenscastle> YES
[0:29:15] <Gorshum> Oh man that makes me nostalgic.

[0:29:52] <avidneptune> Do you want the cum subtitles or the piss subtitles
[0:29:57] <+Javaa01> @GigaBoots Peformance RT goes up to 60fps, not 120, the PS5 is not a 3080
[0:30:04] <+GigaBoots> Your "no signal screen" looks like mine. I'm guessing it's 4K60 but 1080p 120Hz.
[0:30:08] <Astrophizz> it renders 60fps within a 120 window to reduce latency
[0:30:11] <LoreKeeper_Thal> @GigaBoots OH i just realized it's Dan, LUL
[0:30:19] <%KeiganOfAstora> Why don't they ever show an example of subtitles so you know what you're changing
[0:30:21] <+GigaBoots> @Javaa01 Dude, do  your research you have no idea who you're talking to. It's HANDSHAKING at 120Hz.
[0:30:24] <%Ipsenscastle> based on that spinning cog it's currently 4fps
[0:30:32] <%thbluewarden> thbluewarden subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months! Hey Pat, how goes it? if you and Paige were in fact goblins, what kind of goblins would you be?
[0:30:37] <Vex_Machina> ...good.
[0:30:39] <scarman125> didn't Kissanime get nuked?
[0:30:40] <Astrophizz> @javaa01 it does 120 to reduce latency/frame drops
[0:30:41] <%HunguyTV> @KeiganOfAstora They do in the top right corner
[0:30:50] <Jane_Lo> @AzureGale to be fair, sony uped the standart about that with tlou2, that also had very good accesbility options
[0:30:55] <%The_Protagonist> oh Avermedia's good? huh. I was gonna grab a capture card but I wasn't sure what was decent besides elgato
[0:30:55] <%KeiganOfAstora> Oh snap how did I not see that?! LUL

[0:31:16] <%chance_h> Rip and tear!
[0:31:18] <%BarujaraciGaming> lol this game is not going to hit 120 at 4k, sorry bro
[0:31:20] <%AyotoCorp> Might as well do whatever, not like Twitch supports 4k OR 120fps
[0:31:22] <SaltyAzteca> Options waaaaay
[0:31:27] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> that's a lotta good options wow
[0:31:31] <rasmus206060> wow
[0:31:31] <+GigaBoots> @PatStaresAt The game runs at 60fps, but if you enable 120Hz at the system level it will handshake at that to reduce latency. Your capture card will kick it down to 1080p 120Hz though, so don't expect a higher res unless you turn off 120Hz at the system level.

[0:33:16] <+fugatlas> do you want 60 4k, or 60 1080 with ray tracing
[0:33:17] <%AzureGale> Performance or More Performance
[0:33:17] <%amused_platypus> psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon psaHoldon
[0:33:20] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Performance RT is the best option if you want 60FPS
[0:33:20] <%blastyoboots> 60 RT?!?!?!
[0:33:25] <+GigaBoots> @PatStaresAt Perf RT is still 60, just mildly lower dynamic res. I'd stick with it.
[0:33:26] <%HunguyTV> They added it in Miles morales post launch aswell, its great
[0:33:29] <%AzureGale> Let's get them God Rays
[0:33:33] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> just play at 30 it's more cinematic :)

[0:33:44] <deviljhojho_> is that you god? its me, ratchet
[0:33:46] <auraofdawn> Get those rays traced
[0:33:57] <+GigaBoots> Okay, I'm done explaining the game's tech now. I'm goin back to lurk as I pack shit up.
[0:33:58] <+fugatlas> the rt is big worth it, especially because of the armor reflections. I legit gasped looking at ratchets face when he gets a space suit helmet
[0:33:58] <MonsterGills> Take that cyberpunk
[0:34:02] <Profmcstevie> Shiny clank makes me feel uncomfortable
[0:34:03] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Insomniac is ray tracing gods
[0:34:03] <+Javaa01> @fugatlas Performance mode with no RT can't do a full 4k, it's like 1900p, but of course dynamic to deal with drops
[0:34:05] <deviljhojho_> looks better than the movie

[0:39:45] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Hey Pat pro tip with Ratchet and Clank. As you unlock more armour you gain buffs with each piece. You don’t need the armour equipped to get the buff they all stack automatically
[0:39:46] <%AzureGale> Look at those parade balloons
[0:39:46] <avidneptune> Pete from PS3 games
[0:39:47] <scrumbotime> look at how shiny clank is
[0:39:47] <+morningmoondude> there's a no-weapons hub that the pre-order pixelizer can be used in for no reason lol

[0:41:10] <%Ipsenscastle> lazy developers, I sure hope someone got fired for that blunder
[0:41:11] <%Garthunox> Pat you missed the upgrade for krogan vitality at the start
[0:41:12] <+D00msDayDan> can't believe they charged $70 for this vegetation
[0:41:13] <stantheman_97> trash game throw it out
[0:41:15] <balthazar758> literally unplayable
[0:41:18] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I think they changed Qwark VA?
[0:41:19] <%StormBuster24> Oh Ratchet's VA is Tidus's, neat
[0:41:20] <$SGrim> @PatStaresAt you missed boxes, 0/10 playthrough
[0:41:20] <%sjay662> Why is it always Insomniac that gets the dumbest criticism? First puddles in Spiderman, now the foliage here
[0:41:21] <+zzNamttamzz> it's fake vegetation
[0:41:25] <%KeiganOfAstora> boooooooooo
[0:41:27] <jorniev> PARTIIIICLES
[0:41:27] <%Dakuu75> This is cool
[0:41:28] <deviljhojho_> lets pretend
[0:41:33] <+iLike_femboys> @PatStaresAt are you going to play it takes two with Peach?
[0:41:34] <jorniev> GIVE ME MORE PARTICLES
[0:41:35] <%Kirby_Sauce> SPOOGE GUN
[0:41:36] <derap41> plant texture is bugged
[0:41:38] <%UvBenServed> psaGoblin psaGoblin psaGoblin
[0:41:43] <+fugatlas> the game makes it out that the lombaxes disapeared eons ago, but ratchet seems like he is perpetually a 30 something
[0:41:45] <%AzureGale> Yeah Ratchet was kind of a dick in the first PS2 game :x
[0:41:46] <$SGrim> PLAYTHROUGH SAVED
[0:41:47] <Pookiedaexzile> And so it begins
[0:41:47] <viewtifulr> particles everywhere!
[0:41:47] <Profmcstevie> That IS how it happened in the reboot, fucking smiles and happy times
[0:41:47] <%Dfreddy8> GAME JUST STARTED
[0:41:48] <notsoy> a helm breaker is fastest way to smash box clusters
[0:41:49] <$Ziegsy> can you turn the bolts into rupees?
[0:41:53] <gslayer14> yup
[0:41:54] <+NickHatesSnow> Couch
[0:41:54] <StarMechV> you will
[0:41:56] <deviljhojho_> give it a minute
[0:41:56] <+SocialMisfitGamer> L2 and Square
[0:41:58] <+NickHatesSnow> Crouch
[0:41:58] <%Ipsenscastle> You missed Grunt's upgrade, restart
[0:41:58] <%twistedj3ster> you could
[0:41:59] <Tisaric> it used to be crouch + attack
[0:41:59] <lambishly> crouch + attack
[0:41:59] <%Broand> Crouch attack iirc?
[0:41:59] <s1rcuit> crouch and attack @PatStaresAt
[0:41:59] <%cvp5127> L2
[0:42:02] <%Monkeyweed21> later
[0:42:02] <devanmuse> Shoulder button + Wrench attack
[0:42:03] <%AzureGale> No there was a wrench throw
[0:42:03] <%Dakuu75> use to be crouch-attack or something
[0:42:03] <$SGrim> You could, maybe later
[0:42:04] <TourettesPlays> Little environment things you can interact with is like the trademark of Insomniac games, so cool they still do them
[0:42:04] <LorcaNomad> I have special goblins
[0:42:10] <wujak> itll tell you in a second
[0:42:11] <%hat_under_bread> The bolts flying in is super satisfying.
[0:42:15] <StarMechV> THEY WERE
[0:42:16] <SlangPunk> @ziegsy No but you can turn them into spy room gems
[0:42:16] <deviljhojho_> its the ultimate comeback
[0:42:17] <scrumbotime> Hey look Big Al!
[0:42:20] <+dramajoe> it looks like it too
[0:42:22] <derap41> Its just masturbation
[0:42:22] <LoreKeeper_Thal> they were
[0:42:22] <%twistedj3ster> they should be after Nexus
[0:42:25] <Broken_Sonex> Rachet has got to be like 30 something, right?
[0:42:26] <%NovaKnightmare> Passion is appreciated
[0:42:27] <%toolofparanoia> AS THEY SHOULD
[0:42:27] <+Mrkel90> Qwark's Voice Actor was suffering through alzheimer's and Covid so he does not reprise his role in this
[0:42:28] <SaltyAzteca> You could say they were motivated
[0:42:29] <%Broand> they love ratchet games
[0:42:29] <Midknightsun316> I remember playing the hell out of the first three games
[0:42:30] <%Dakuu75> it's a good franchise dude4
[0:42:31] <%AzureGale> "They sure pulled out all the stops" a reference to the dev team, perhaps
[0:42:31] <%sjay662> @PatStaresAt they haven't made a mainline Rachet game since PS3
[0:42:32] <viewtifulr> ITS huge nerd Big Al
[0:42:32] <%RetroCop87> Jak > Ratchet, Clank > Daxter, All > Sly
[0:42:35] <rosemon5001> the map at the start is pretty good and later on you get a upgrade that shows the locations of collectibles
[0:42:35] <%Ranryu692> this feels like a trap
[0:42:36] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DONT HAVE TO CRUNCH
[0:42:36] <avidneptune> Nexus was great
[0:42:39] <+BusterRepukken> Kerwan was such a good planet
[0:42:39] <kamen_advent> fun fact: all the voice acting was done from the actor's homes due to the big sick
[0:42:40] <deviljhojho_> me
[0:42:42] <reonome> literally WHO
[0:42:43] <TourettesPlays> Insomniac are my favorite games studio, love them
[0:42:45] <lambishly> Game 1
[0:42:45] <+morningmoondude> Sony probably gave 'em a blank check after Spider-man lol
[0:42:45] <+iLike_femboys> Looking at you nintendo with your shit remakes
[0:42:45] <%saadi90> Insomniac puts a lot of love
[0:42:47] <MAX116030> Does sound like insomniac team
[0:42:47] <+SocialMisfitGamer> yeah
[0:42:48] <%AzureGale> GET GUN
[0:42:49] <deviljhojho_> the worst gun in the game tomatoPog
[0:42:54] <%MisterRockett> It's amazing how Insomniac doesn't seem tired of making R&C games.
[0:42:59] <Aeroallways> that was R&C 1
[0:43:00] <+SolidusRex> Yes you did Pat
[0:43:03] <farrellcityking> This is what it feels and looks like to work for a Sony 1st Party
[0:43:05] <+SolidusRex> first game
[0:43:06] <%ansterdamn> this is a genius way to recap the original games LUL
[0:43:07] <+NekoDraga> First game
[0:43:08] <%MisterRockett> It was in the reboot I think.
[0:43:08] <s1rcuit> it was super downplayed
[0:43:12] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Insomniac definitely has a lot of love for ratchet and clank
[0:43:13] <%AzureGale> Goon-4-Less
[0:43:17] <slix3431> Pat you fired a shot into the crowd
[0:43:23] <kozboz96> oh shit goons 4 less are back
[0:43:24] <%toolofparanoia> TERRORIST ATTACK
[0:43:27] <slix3431> You fuckin murdered a fan
[0:43:31] <derap41> Just casual murder
[0:43:35] <deviljhojho_> then they die
[0:43:35] <viewtifulr> Batraians...
[0:43:35] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Feel that feedback trigger Pat
[0:43:40] <%ape_hawk> so who is pat gonna romance in this game? himself?
[0:43:41] <%AzureGale> SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS THE DEADLIEST SON-OF-A-BITCH IN SPACE
[0:43:42] <deviljhojho_> oh yeah its fucking terrible
[0:43:43] <%twistedj3ster> oh that BASS
[0:43:44] <Dunmarkh> kill em all  pat
[0:43:45] <+BusterRepukken> guns level up
[0:43:45] <derap41> Its suppose to suck shit
[0:43:45] <SaltyAzteca> Of course, its the first gun LUL
[0:43:46] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @PatStaresAt How's those triggers coming along so far?
[0:43:46] <StarMechV> It's the starting gun
[0:43:50] <s1rcuit> all the starter guns suck
[0:43:50] <Broken_Sonex> RACHET JUST KILLE THOSE GUYS
[0:43:51] <%toolofparanoia> its the first gun
[0:43:52] <%AzureGale> Yeah but if you keep using the gun it will stop sucking
[0:43:54] <%bevyrage> that's how it's suppose to be pat. you upgrade it to be good or you just use a different gun
[0:43:54] <%Dfreddy8> It's fine, they're not human.
[0:43:56] <crocboyz> you can level the guns
[0:43:56] <+MisterAvry> how do you mistake the identity of someone who is in the middle of a parade about their fucking identity?
[0:43:57] <%twistedj3ster> to taunt us
[0:43:57] <mattdaddyd101> did Pat ever played the ps3 ones
[0:44:01] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @azuregale Such a good line
[0:44:02] <%Monkeyweed21> dont bother
[0:44:03] <%Dakuu75> whaaaaaat, c'mon the first guns are always a pistol and a bomb-thing. they're good~ <3
[0:44:03] <+Javaa01> It becomes a full auto spread shot gun at lvl 5, so it's worth grinding up
[0:44:06] <%shadowace2400> !uptime
[0:44:06] <@Moobot> @shadowace2400 I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 44m 25s.
[0:44:06] <+SolidusRex> The gun will get better
[0:44:08] <deviljhojho_> trigger resistance
[0:44:15] <auraofdawn> They always have to have the boring default pistol
[0:44:16] <%Monkeyweed21> PS5's arent real
[0:44:16] <%amused_platypus> that controller... its chaos
[0:44:17] <%MisterRockett> It's the starter gun but they all also get better.
[0:44:22] <TourettesPlays> Thannk GOD the motion blur isn't as bad as the PS4 game, that shit actually hurt my eyes
[0:44:27] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Every gun uses the trigger resistance for different abilities
[0:44:30] <+zzNamttamzz> Can you feel your footsteps?
[0:44:30] <+MisterAvry> whooaoaoaaa!
[0:44:32] <%ansterdamn> i hope the RYNO is still in here
[0:44:33] <BigFingerRo> WHOAWHOAWHAO
[0:44:35] <+morningmoondude> DEADLY BALLOONS
[0:44:44] <BigFingerRo> Classic for-kids shot
[0:44:46] <%Dfreddy8> ROLLIN AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
[0:44:48] <+allups> pretty cool sci-fi
[0:44:48] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @skyentombment NO,STOP LUL
[0:44:52] <%chance_h> Dang it pat we don’t want to see your pulse vibration fewtures
[0:44:55] <+Qsmash_> hap...pyness?
[0:44:55] <+NickHatesSnow> nah you feel better than them
[0:44:56] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> the Mania effect. Just pure satisfaction.
[0:44:58] <oozebear> Pat, that's called Happiness. we have a word for that
[0:44:58] <derap41> Nostalgia neurons activated
[0:44:59] <%Ipsenscastle> I'd kill for Sonic Mania 2
[0:45:00] <%mrsnakeyogirl> This game uses the duel sense the most so far
[0:45:01] <reonome> you're HAVING FUN? Noooooo
[0:45:01] <dan_g_v> so, feeling like a loser? :3
[0:45:02] <+morningmoondude> I like some Boost Sonic, and Ratchet has a lot that scratches that exact itch lol
[0:45:04] <%HunguyTV> If only sonic games had this budget
[0:45:04] <crimeagentalpha> Sonic HEROES
[0:45:05] <Vex_Machina> The face?!
[0:45:05] <fojidoj> True that
[0:45:07] <%ssjklyco> Except Ratchet plays good and feels good
[0:45:10] <%RetroCop87> Pat, did you ever play Jak Combat Racing?
[0:45:15] <%VvTacoSaladvV> Ratchet and Clank won the mascot platformer wars
[0:45:15] <Pookiedaexzile> But you don't have to lie to yourself about them having more going on than they do
[0:45:16] <+MisterAvry> yeah this is what sonic games would be like if sonic games hadn't sucked since the Clinton admin
[0:45:16] <%Dakuu75> wish I could get a PS5 but, I dfon't wanna pay 1.5k for one
[0:45:16] <rosemon5001> every weapon sucks until you lvl it and put upgrades in them
[0:45:17] <Dova573> Ratchet and clank were always the better furry franchise
[0:45:17] <lambishly> Yeah except unlike sonic Rachet and Clank were at worst a 7/10
[0:45:20] <StarMechV> specific part grappling hook
[0:45:21] <scarman125> having been a kid who only really played Nintendo games I know absolutely nothing about this franchise.
[0:45:21] <SlangPunk> Mania 2 NEEDS to happen
[0:45:21] <%BarujaraciGaming> smiling in the face as opposed to smiling in the butthole
[0:45:23] <Dre_> now they just need to make a new jak and daxter
[0:45:25] <+morningmoondude> BOUNCE ON HIS ASS
[0:45:27] <%AzureGale> Dr Nerfarious best villain
[0:45:28] <+kullumanati> Except the massive dissatisfaction
[0:45:33] <+SocialMisfitGamer> HE'S ALSO FUCKING DEAD FROM THE LAST GAME
[0:45:34] <dan_g_v> look at all that dead people
[0:45:34] <%AzureGale> That's Al
[0:45:35] <%Ipsenscastle> Insomniac would make a sick Sonic game
[0:45:37] <BigFingerRo> AGAIN
[0:45:38] <%NovaKnightmare> Thats the Plumber!
[0:45:40] <Bigyanno> Homer BLIMPson
[0:45:40] <Afterman_> legally distinct
[0:45:40] <T_Sasquatch> anyone have a list of good ratchet and clank games ?
[0:45:41] <+fugatlas> rip big al
[0:45:42] <BigFingerRo> WHAOAOWOAOOW
[0:45:43] <+Mrkel90> that was Al from the original trilogy
[0:45:45] <+Daedalus119> the visuals in this game though
[0:45:47] <dan_g_v> all those shots probably killed like a dozen innocent civilians or something
[0:45:54] <$jacob2pop> Nefarious came back in All 4 One
[0:45:55] <BigFingerRo> GOTTA get those trailer shot
[0:46:01] <%Dfreddy8> BOXES
[0:46:01] <%abelincoln_catpuncher> isn't that Quarks VA?
[0:46:07] <deviljhojho_> game is straight up rock solid
[0:46:07] <%Alaster101> @t_sasquatch basically all of them
[0:46:08] <%BallerSwagBro9k> @skyentombment Woolie ruined everything LUL
[0:46:11] <DracaenaLeaf> They showed too much walking yeah
[0:46:12] <%BinaryFireball> itsa good feel game
[0:46:13] <ToneBacas> yes
[0:46:13] <+michingmallecho> It's the seamless transitions that makes it all come together
[0:46:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Game has good mouth feel
[0:46:17] <Tisaric> the 60fps seems to help that a lot
[0:46:18] <+morningmoondude> The gamefeel is incredible
[0:46:20] <+MisterAvry> feel good
[0:46:22] <deviljhojho_> absolutely
[0:46:23] <$SGrim> The barrels have bolts too
[0:46:24] <Profmcstevie> It takes talent to make it look boring far as I can tell
[0:46:25] <+SolidusRex> R&C games always play good
[0:46:26] <StarMechV> @abelincoln_catpuncher Qwark's original VA retired due to alzheimers
[0:46:26] <+Bouerd> I can't believe 'game feel' is a real thing now
[0:46:26] <+fugatlas> look at this videogame ass videgame
[0:46:26] <%Monkeyweed21> yes pat games are meant to be played
[0:46:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Give this man Jack and Daxter  Returns
[0:46:27] <+MisterAvry> buttery?
[0:46:29] <+Rafraud> Which trigger setting are you on Pat
[0:46:30] <Midknightsun316> It's really like they wanted to make this game lmao
[0:46:31] <%AzureGale> Yeah, the Ratchet games feel goddamn great to play
[0:46:31] <lambishly> Fun gameplay doesn't demo as well as cutscenes
[0:46:31] <%Freddy253> speen
[0:46:32] <datfoogamma> Do you actually FEEL like Ratchet?
[0:46:33] <Laseki> @abelincoln_catpuncher nah, quarks VA wasn't able to do anything for this game cause of health reasons
[0:46:34] <Virokwet> this never looked boring to me
[0:46:35] <$SGrim> YOU MISSED THE BARRELS
[0:46:35] <Huntercd> This the furry game?
[0:46:39] <Tisaric> like the movie game felt like utter trash at 30
[0:46:40] <StarlitStunner> Murder every box!
[0:46:40] <%hat_under_bread> This is a good tutorial/hook.
[0:46:45] <+morningmoondude> Remember you have another gun
[0:46:45] <+fugatlas> turning the goons into wholesome dudebros is so good
[0:46:46] <derap41> This games sound is a all over the place
[0:46:50] <MAX116030> kind a like web slinging in Spiderman
[0:46:52] <+michingmallecho> Yes this is the furry game.
[0:46:55] <+SolidusRex> They've been refining this formula for 19 years
[0:46:56] <%Monkeyweed21> ayy Crack in Time
[0:46:57] <+morningmoondude> Pixelator gun
[0:47:01] <+michingmallecho> hasL
[0:47:01] <T_Sasquatch> @Alaster101 really ? i was obsessed with it when i was younger until i realised recently that i never actually beat one. Only ones i played were on ps2
[0:47:03] <deviljhojho_> the exagerated swagger of an adult lombax
[0:47:11] <+SocialMisfitGamer> The Great Clock!? This is a part of the ORIGINAL timeline!?
[0:47:12] <$jacob2pop> it's a form of game play they nailed in the second game and have just fine tuned for nearly 20 years
[0:47:12] <datfoogamma> I love these shark lizard guys
[0:47:18] <mattdaddyd101> hands do let you feel things
[0:47:22] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at all this money
[0:47:29] <BigFingerRo> @BallerSwagBro9k and that's just a general statement! not just related to this!
[0:47:34] <+SocialMisfitGamer> I though this was reboot timeline
[0:47:34] <%AzureGale> AIRSHIP BOSS TIEM
[0:47:38] <%ansterdamn> enemies always tend do with flair in r&c games, i love it~
[0:47:38] <$jacob2pop> Reminder that the reboot game is not cannon to this
[0:47:38] <%NateyBeak> I mean this is great and all.. but the foliage doesnt react NotLikeThis

[0:47:54] <+SocialMisfitGamer> @jacob2pop Oh...
[0:47:55] <+allups> these guys should make a spider-man game
[0:47:56] <pmaratsuper> The harder you press the trigger, the faster you shoot
[0:47:57] <+michingmallecho> Insomniac had that weird little period with the sunset overdrive and the 4 player co-op game
[0:47:58] <Broken_Sonex> DEAD ALL FUCKING DEAD

[0:56:43] <%Dakuu75> that's so fucking dope
[0:56:45] <+BigGooj> @PatStaresAt hey pat, had a question about your tv if you've got a sec. I'm hopefully gonna be getting the same lg tv as you next month when i move, did you get any extended warranty for your OLED or do you not mess with that garbage?
[0:56:46] <Afterman_> uh
[0:56:46] <+StrikeTheErf> that looks incredible
[0:56:48] <jorniev> RATCHET KILLED THE DINOS

[0:56:54] <Astrophizz> grapple
[0:56:54] <jja8020> ZA HANDO
[0:56:54] <%bevyrage> that's a pretty sick grappling animation
[0:56:54] <+MisterAvry> that's a really cool effect
[0:56:56] <Zero_Jacks> D4C
[0:56:56] <%Ipsenscastle> Ratchet seems happy about the horrible disaster he caused
[0:56:57] <PanicSwytch> Er ma gerd no Loading
[0:56:58] <%OrangeMDT> These stories are all about protags not acting quickly
[0:57:05] <%Dfreddy8> How could Dr. Nefarious do this .
[0:57:05] <%topendbuzza> woah thats an insane effect
[0:57:06] <Ner234> It's basically just a grappling hook but it looks SO cool.
[0:57:10] <RaidenRising> D4C
[0:57:26] <%Arancet> pat enjoys the money injected into his eyeballs
[0:57:26] <%AzureGale> Insomniac games have FANTASTIC particle and debris effects
[0:57:27] <%CommanderSqueaks> I think this is the first PS5 game I've seen that FEELS like a next gen video game.
[0:57:31] <%hat_under_bread> Things blowing up in the background when you shoot = good gameplay. Unironically.
[0:57:35] <StarlitStunner> Stimulating
[0:57:35] <mattdaddyd101> Big murder feel good
[0:57:40] <Dunmarkh> TO NUT
[0:57:44] <+FoolsArcade> Clank didn't build it just rebuilt it
[0:57:44] <%President_Miyazaki> Hey, he just fixed it.
[0:57:44] <%cvp5127> cuz hes a bro
[0:57:46] <%chiluzza> IT PROBABLY WORKS IF YOU DONT SHOOT IT
[0:57:46] <Dunmarkh> IS TO LIVE
[0:57:47] <%AzureGale> LUL
[0:57:48] <%Black_Machete> he didn't he fixed it
[0:57:48] <SaltyAzteca> Its the thought that counts
[0:57:50] <Pookiedaexzile> He's a good Friend
[0:57:51] <derap41> Clank it the ultimate wingman
[0:57:56] <PanicSwytch> Clank is a good wing man
[0:57:57] <SlangPunk> @ner234 yeah i figured that at first, but it helps a ton with I-frames in fights
[0:57:59] <stantheman_97> he's a bro
[0:57:59] <+michingmallecho> Clank just wanted to be the ultimate wingman
[0:58:00] <%AzureGale> Clank is like you must continue the Ratchet bloodline
[0:58:01] <%mrsnakeyogirl> I really enjoy James Arnold Taylor as ratchet
[0:58:01] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Does this have good game feel so far?
[0:58:03] <%Dfreddy8> Nice water
[0:58:04] <Pookiedaexzile> A Real Bro builds a time machine to help his friend nut
[0:58:05] <+CycloneEternalJoker> Clank tried doing a good but then all hell broke loose
[0:58:05] <%maybefalco> look at that WATER
[0:58:06] <pmaratsuper> The answer lies in the PS3 games
[0:58:07] <StarMechV> @patstaresat You can jump whole shooting to dodge
[0:58:08] <BigFingerRo> I'm gonna FUCKING NNNNNNUT- PeachSaliva, 2020
[0:58:10] <Aeroallways> Dude's been trying to get his nut of for about 5 games now
[0:58:10] <%twistedj3ster> wait, what happened to the lombax in 2? I forget
[0:58:13] <+froggycleric> Clank knows he's going to anyway
[0:58:18] <+Mintios> They share 1 brain cell
[0:58:19] <%President_Miyazaki> Probably just thought it'd break, like it did before.
[0:58:19] <jja8020> Ratchet should've aimed for the head
[0:58:22] <gslayer14> thought he'd just shoot nefarious lol
[0:58:24] <+TyphonTwister> Probably a case of "we can fix it later"
[0:58:25] <viewtifulr> he wanted to be bestman
[0:58:26] <+teh_rawk> reminder that clank is supposed to be the real protag
[0:58:27] <Storm_Samurai> How do you throw the wrench
[0:58:27] <StarlitStunner> STRAFE!!
[0:58:28] <+IxDomxI> @PatStaresAt he has an entire arc during the ps3 games where he's trying to find his family because he's the last lombax
[0:58:31] <%AzureGale> Yeaaaaaaah strafing
[0:58:32] <StarlitStunner> yeyeyeye
[0:58:33] <jorniev> AWESOME
[0:58:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt he probably thought it was  to shoot NAFARIOUS
[0:58:37] <%Ranryu692> he probably thought he didn't need to tell him to not shoot the dimension gun
[0:58:39] <BigFingerRo> good water
[0:58:40] <$jacob2pop> I assume he thought Ratchet was aiming for Nefarious
[0:58:40] <derap41> Clank been nutting is  robo its time  for Rachet to get soem
[0:58:41] <%chiluzza> ALSO what friend decides the best course of action is to shoot their friends gift
[0:58:44] <%CommanderSqueaks> OH NO
[0:58:45] <T_Sasquatch> i cant believe he has the same jump animation
[0:58:46] <+CycloneEternalJoker> @Aeroallways She fucked off in the 3rd game

[0:58:56] <+fugatlas> albeit really stupidly
[0:58:58] <Afterman_> thats horror

[0:59:53] <%miguelrod777> wrong one
[0:59:56] <%Ipsenscastle> you changed vibrations
[0:59:58] <+NickHatesSnow> Lombaxes are litterally mandolorians in this world
[0:59:59] <+MajorCrasher> wrong setting
[1:00:00] <+Rafraud> wrong setting
[1:00:01] <LorcaNomad> also pat prioritize shooting over melee for weapon XP
[1:00:04] <derap41> Pat check the audio

[1:00:42] <Mariakko> These are some options
[1:00:47] <%Dakuu75> wow, I've NEVER seen an option to adjust the hit-confirm sfx
[1:00:48] <SaltyAzteca> So frail and glass, his hands
[1:00:48] <%MisterRockett> @twistedj3ster She basically escaped all the crack in time bullshit and also made it so Ratchet can say he's the last Lombax in the galaxy he's currently in.
[1:00:51] <%ansterdamn> this is just options porn the game
[1:00:55] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt The accessibility options in this game are amazing

[1:01:51] <%ssjklyco> Kida
[1:01:57] <%Dfreddy8> Dr. Nefarious stole it first btw
[1:01:57] <%nanaki_ff14> War Criminals Rachet and Clank

[1:02:13] <+neonNeptunian> Dr Nefarious from ratchet 3 was a classic villain
[1:02:13] <%ape_hawk> its disorienting
[1:02:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> Clank is the ultimate wingman
[1:02:16] <%Undenizen> Is Clank flirting?
[1:02:16] <+NickHatesSnow> nefarious was gonna kill everyone so this is better
[1:02:24] <kentrix11> Space moves instead of you.

[1:02:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> @johnnychopsocky He's going in so hard and I love it.
[1:02:28] <%chance_h> Share a spit roast together
[1:02:34] <+chiazam> Ratchet doesn't sound to excited to go look for Lombaxes
[1:02:35] <+rean_v> looking at the rifts in photo mode is kinda trippy
[1:02:38] <%MisterRockett> @T_Sasquatch Angela Cross from Going Commando was one and they've been embarassed about forgetting she existed for years.

[1:02:54] <$SGrim> Interesting fact: Rivet is trans. Angela Cross from Going Commando is the only other female Lombax in the series so far. In that game, she says genetically female Lombax don't have tails. It's a  feature found on the y chromosome.

[1:03:17] <%Dfreddy8> This is CHAOS
[1:03:21] <%Undenizen> I can't believe you killed that bro
[1:03:25] <T_Sasquatch> @SGrim cmon bruh
[1:03:25] <%toolofparanoia> That gun fucks
[1:03:26] <Chaos_Aether> Contract sucks
[1:03:26] <+kullumanati> You are the number one Ratchet streamer.
[1:03:27] <ShadeTheNovice> and then instant DEATH
[1:03:27] <%megadblitz> what if tidus was in this game
[1:03:28] <+michingmallecho> hasNerd hasNerd
[1:03:37] <jorniev> RACHET KILLS A LOT FOR SUCH A NICE GUY
[1:03:37] <deviljhojho_> he just straight up murders them
[1:03:38] <Dunmarkh> based spree killer
[1:03:39] <%JoshManVGH> I don't know what brand of humor this qualifies as, but I'm all for it.
[1:03:39] <+NickHatesSnow> nope
[1:03:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> He does his wholesomely tho
[1:03:41] <+RoeDeerRootie> those goons are DEAD
[1:03:41] <Dova573> Expecially in Deadlock
[1:03:41] <%toolofparanoia> NOPE
[1:03:41] <s1rcuit> @SGrim interesting, where did you learn that?
[1:03:42] <%Ipsenscastle> yes
[1:03:42] <%MisterRockett> @SGrim Female Lombaxes are also apparently taller.
[1:03:42] <+Mintios> Eh..
[1:03:42] <gslayer14> yeah
[1:03:42] <derap41> This series used to be edgy
[1:03:42] <%ape_hawk> nah, sounds american to me
[1:03:43] <%ssjklyco> No. It works
[1:03:43] <Chaos_Aether> nope
[1:03:43] <%NovaKnightmare> Its ok because theyre not human!
[1:03:44] <SaltyAzteca> He's a hero, its fine
[1:03:44] <%walternatorz> classic american fun, pat
[1:03:45] <slix3431> Values dissonence
[1:03:45] <%Dfreddy8> They're not human so it's ok.
[1:03:45] <+pectusumbra> I mean this makes it work but I get what you mean
[1:03:45] <gslayer14> it's also great
[1:03:46] <ultran122> he's not family friendly, one of the games is literally called Up Your Arsenal
[1:03:46] <LorcaNomad> it's always been weird yea
[1:03:46] <%nanaki_ff14> Is this Strangers in Paradise all along?
[1:03:46] <Pookiedaexzile> That's the point
[1:03:46] <BigFingerRo> they're cartoon bullets
[1:03:47] <%Dakuu75> it's ok, he only kills huge freakzoids and robots
[1:03:47] <Broken_Sonex> Man.......Rachet just murders people
[1:03:47] <%HunguyTV> Sony first parry games has alot of dark undertones
[1:03:48] <dan_g_v> Conkers
[1:03:48] <%skeleklng> Sounds like the ideal American hero
[1:03:48] <T_Sasquatch> we have toy guns pat, violence is intrinsic
[1:03:48] <+morningmoondude> sorta
[1:03:48] <%miguelrod777> it's ok they are evil
[1:03:48] <%AzureGale> It's okay, they're space guns
[1:03:48] <%Ravioli_Ronin> He’s the Lombard, he speaks for the shrubs
[1:03:48] <+jetrouverai> ratchet loves murder
[1:03:48] <%Robot_Nixon_> yea
[1:03:48] <placeholder03> nope
[1:03:49] <+ALazo> Nah, sounds like all family friendly characters
[1:03:49] <%President_Miyazaki> I mean the 3rd one had Quark talk about fucking a monkey.
[1:03:51] <%bevyrage> i just noticed your magazine counter on the gun is the pair of blue lights
[1:03:51] <kentrix11> THat's just cartoons
[1:03:51] <viewtifulr> no he's having fun
[1:03:52] <BigFingerRo> they just defeat them
[1:03:52] <%Dr_DangerPhD> nah it's sick
[1:03:52] <%MidnightBurst12> a little
[1:03:53] <tigeruppercut1226> It made a lot more sense when the games were rated T
[1:03:53] <datfoogamma> I'm from USA so nah
[1:03:54] <+Javaa01> The PS2 and most of the PS3 games had sexual innuendos as subtitles
[1:03:54] <BigFingerRo> no kills
[1:03:54] <ELFucilaNeroIV> it wasn't like that in the first one
[1:03:55] <MechanizedGentleman> he's just knocking them out, it's a knockout shotgun Kappa
[1:03:55] <UnImprest> no shut up tho
[1:03:55] <Pookiedaexzile> That's kinda the Whole Point of the Series
[1:03:55] <%toolofparanoia> They deserved it
[1:03:56] <%MechArch> kids love murder
[1:03:56] <+neonNeptunian> cartoon bullets
[1:03:56] <Dova573> Were people get merced left and right
[1:03:56] <+NekoDraga> Nah, kids love gratuitous violence
[1:03:57] <%NateyBeak> kids love guns
[1:03:57] <%doc_ock_rokc> We literally have a weapon called RIP YOU A NEW ONE
[1:03:57] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> lookit dis MONEY
[1:03:57] <%MisterRockett> I've thought about that for years and I love it.
[1:03:59] <+TyphonTwister> It's an all ages series, it's fine
[1:04:00] <%thbluewarden> a little, but its a space shotgun
[1:04:00] <+michingmallecho> It's not murder if you paint it in bright colors... GlitchCat
[1:04:02] <+chiazam> The series has always been like this
[1:04:04] <Zalapski> I mean Nathan drake is a mass murderer
[1:04:04] <%toolofparanoia> JUSTIFYABLE HOMICIDE
[1:04:04] <%cvp5127> they all had parachutes
[1:04:05] <%Arweynn> OH NO!
[1:04:06] <championofsomeone> not just kills but murders
[1:04:08] <+MajorCrasher> nah, tons of family friendly characters kill people
[1:04:09] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt You kill people by the hundreds in just gameplay alone in these games
[1:04:09] <%mrsnakeyogirl> That’s the best part about it
[1:04:09] <slix3431> Hey Pat remember Redwall when Furries killed each other?
[1:04:09] <+morningmoondude> like the game will have KILL ALL GOONS on screen at times
[1:04:10] <%Ravioli_Ronin> This is on-par with fortnite violence tbh
[1:04:13] <heart_ablaze> I assume that the guns non lethal
[1:04:17] <SaltyAzteca> IS THAT A SALE
[1:04:17] <%Dakuu75> acceptable losses
[1:04:17] <+bluguu> up your arsenal
[1:04:18] <Afterman_> and reality
[1:04:18] <$SGrim> @SGrim @s1rcuit from playing Going Commando.
[1:04:21] <Broken_Sonex> RACHET IS FURRY NATHAN DRAKE
[1:04:23] <%Undenizen> is that the infinity gauntlet?
[1:04:24] <SaltyAzteca> No its the normal price, aww
[1:04:24] <+MajorCrasher> like Indiana Jones, Han solo, etc
[1:04:33] <+projectmanatees> Is Ratchet a shoto?
[1:04:33] <+blink289> Is it just me whats up with the robotic sound?
[1:04:33] <LorcaNomad> shatterbomb gud
[1:04:36] <+TyphonTwister> Also one of the games has straight up a cosmic horror as a villain, so they care about kids, lol
[1:04:37] <fairore> this ost is hittin
[1:04:41] <%Undenizen> @Broken_Sonex yeah.... yeah.
[1:04:48] <%blastyoboots> the fist looks amazing in your arse-nal
[1:04:49] <s1rcuit> @SGrim I played GC and I don't remember there being any mention of the thing about tails
[1:04:56] <derap41> Pat could you lower the music is way to bombastic
[1:04:58] <knight_verse> @SGrim, yeah, I will wait for the developers to say something before believing someone on the internet, besides, she's from an alternate dimension, no on siad they have to follow the same rules.
[1:05:02] <@PeachSaliva> Wow, this is gorgeous.
[1:05:03] <Broken_Sonex> @Broken_Sonex WHAT A FRENDLY MURDERER
[1:05:03] <$jacob2pop> Into the Nexus is basically "Fight this Elder Gid"
[1:05:08] <$SGrim> @SGrim @MisterRockett and, at least from Angela Cross' example, much larger muscles.
[1:05:10] <%sjay662> Every title in this series is a sex pun/crude humor
[1:05:10] <%megadblitz> what's the gameplay gimmick this time around?
[1:05:12] <@PeachSaliva> @PatStaresAt turn the sound down a bit doll
[1:05:14] <wolfen091> idk if i could take goofy the whole time for a game, looks great though
[1:05:23] <+BIumen> usually means health
[1:05:24] <+NekoDraga> You got more health
[1:05:25] <%AzureGale> You got 10 health
[1:05:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> I find it refreshing that Ratchet isn't super snarky or anything, he's just kinda nice.
[1:05:26] <+neonNeptunian> doubled your hp!
[1:05:27] <%hat_under_bread> Double health at least.
[1:05:28] <%RoboticAnimeDude> more hp
[1:05:29] <s1rcuit> @PeachSaliva hi Paige, how are you?
[1:05:29] <%ForlornCarton> +10 life
[1:05:30] <ultran122> means you upgraded it by using it @PatStaresAt
[1:05:31] <theanora1> doubled your health
[1:05:31] <+johnnychopsocky> Number go up
[1:05:32] <%psidefx> more health
[1:05:33] <$jacob2pop> @knight_verse they already said that wasn't the case
[1:05:35] <+lordericter> yeah I made it right in time for the game itself to start
[1:05:37] <%Broand> +10 max health it looks like
[1:05:40] <%JoshManVGH> Got more hit points
[1:05:41] <SlangPunk> Don’t forget, in the first game Ratchet was just a space hick who just wanted to get off planet and shoot shit
[1:05:42] <Afterman_> all those robo-giefs
[1:05:46] <datfoogamma> Lil mecha-Giefs
[1:05:47] <SaltyAzteca> Mech zangief? LUL
[1:05:49] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Health big up
[1:05:50] <jorniev> pat the sound?
[1:05:51] <BigFingerRo> @derap41 Pat is bombasTIC, mr fan-tas-TIC
[1:05:55] <jorniev> on your house
[1:05:58] <mattdaddyd101> RoBO geefs
[1:06:01] <%cvp5127> yes
[1:06:01] <Chaos_Aether> Hi paige
[1:06:01] <+NekoDraga> They do
[1:06:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:06:02] <ultran122> @SlangPunk so Ratchet is furry Luke Skywalker
[1:06:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> Guns levelup
[1:06:03] <+Jakeofalco> yep
[1:06:04] <+dramajoe> yes
[1:06:04] <%RoboticAnimeDude> yes all guns level
[1:06:04] <BinaryShuffle> top right
[1:06:06] <%President_Miyazaki> Yes
[1:06:06] <knight_verse> @jacob2pop, when? please provide a link.
[1:06:08] <+johnnychopsocky> Oh yeah, guns level up
[1:06:08] <%nanaki_ff14> @PatStaresAt  Peach is calling for you
[1:06:10] <%AzureGale> Yeah leveling guns is like one of the series' trademarks
[1:06:10] <PanicSwytch> Yes
[1:06:10] <+SolidusRex> yes
[1:06:13] <+projectmanatees> I miss Angela from the second game she was cool
[1:06:13] <Afterman_> robo-gief is the official name
[1:06:14] <+Javaa01> Yes, each gun goes up to level 5 on New Game (10 on NG+)
[1:06:16] <+NekoDraga> Your health and weapon XP are under their bars
[1:06:19] <+johnnychopsocky> Strength go UP
[1:06:19] <marvel877> Boy I'd like to find a PS5 available online so I can play this.
[1:06:21] <$SGrim> @knight_verse She's confirmed from the same species. Also, I'm not believing someone from the internet. The game Going Commando specifically says tails on Lombaxes are a purely genetically male trait.
[1:06:22] <Applepieenthusiast> peach summons you pat
[1:06:22] <+Chex868> its all fun and games until rachet accidently friendly fires a kid
[1:06:24] <%mrsnakeyogirl> Yes they do
[1:06:26] <%MisterRockett> @SGrim The one who modeled Rivet also made sure SHE has larger muscles than Ratchet so I think Ratchet is just a weeny.
[1:06:26] <%JoshManVGH> Yes. Exp bars on left and right of the hud
[1:06:28] <%toolofparanoia> Spaghetti Cannon
[1:06:31] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Guns level up and gain new functions at level 5
[1:06:31] <%AzureGale> SIGMA FIGHT 1
[1:06:34] <%mrsnakeyogirl> And they get a big upgrade at max level
[1:06:36] <+Mintios> Lawrence is a DAD!
[1:06:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> NEFARIOUS GIVES PATERNITY LEAVE
[1:06:40] <kozboz96> oh paternity leave good for lawrence
[1:06:42] <BappoTheMighty> I feel like this is the end of the game, but I know it's not and it's a bit strange.
[1:06:42] <lvl_mania> gun levels just give you more of the skill tree
[1:06:45] <%nanaki_ff14> @PeachSaliva sorry he is too far deep and has left this reality
[1:06:48] <%Undenizen> so, does Nefarious have union?
[1:06:48] <derap41> Wow Pat is gone into the game
[1:06:49] <kentrix11> Oh paid maternity leave, Nefarious is better than the United states.
[1:06:49] <%AncelDeLambert> shotty not too hotty
[1:06:49] <%Ranryu692> This is making me want to rewatch Megamind
[1:06:52] <%Dakuu75> did he say he gave his assistant paternity leave? the buttler robot?
[1:06:54] <Afterman_> i like how he has the color scheme of that buzz lightyear villain
[1:06:54] <%MaxeusTheFirst> The villian gives paid paternity leave? What a hero!
[1:06:58] <BinaryShuffle> Nefarious has better benefits than many American companies LUL
[1:07:01] <%GarbageNirvana> Well he can't be that bad of a boss
[1:07:06] <$SGrim> @SGrim @MisterRockett so ratchet is a twink furry icon? Cool.
[1:07:12] <+projectmanatees> Lawrence had a kid?
[1:07:15] <%AncelDeLambert> Zzorg?
[1:07:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Confirmed that Dr. Nefarious provides better medical benefits than the vast majority of US corporations.
[1:07:32] <%amused_platypus> wait so  Lawrence had a baby and theres fraternity leave in this dimension
[1:07:34] <%genepark> Yes it was for Lawrence and he has a kid now
[1:07:37] <johnthegg> i like how he dances when he hits you
[1:07:41] <+thegreenbenis> He is way less evil than Amazon. @PatStaresAt
[1:07:42] <LoreKeeper_Thal> avoid the AOES PAT
[1:07:47] <knight_verse> @SGrim: you do know that they can easily retcon that, right? but like I said, different dimensions. Pleade provide a link to where it's confirmed.
[1:07:48] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Is Dr. Nefarious really the bad guy? I wanna see what he can do as a leader...
[1:07:49] <Afterman_> even the worst of the worst in this game is better than Corp America
[1:07:49] <$SGrim> @CommanderSqueaks he may be evil, but he's not a capitalist.
[1:07:53] <%MisterRockett> @CommanderSqueaks He's forced to. Goons 4 Less have unionized contracts.
[1:07:55] <+neonNeptunian> awww, it WAS for lawrence?
[1:07:56] <+D00msDayDan> i would tell you to watch for the telegraphs but i don't pay your sub
[1:07:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dr. Nefarious less evil then Jeff Bezos.
[1:07:58] <%toolofparanoia> ENFORCUH
[1:08:02] <+lordericter> oh you have the power of The Hand in this game
[1:08:07] <+projectmanatees> I’m happy for Lawrence bepWow
[1:08:10] <deviljhojho_> goons 4 less treas their goons right. they are still gonna die tho
[1:08:14] <+morningmoondude> it's the one fight the bitchgun is good for
[1:08:16] <LoreKeeper_Thal> sadly the shotgun in this game is poopoo
[1:08:16] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CommanderSqueaks Lawrence isn't Goons 4 Less, he's his personal assistant.
[1:08:20] <+NickHatesSnow> the pistol and pixelizer?
[1:08:25] <deviljhojho_> i wish my grunt organization had a union
[1:08:26] <%psidefx> the basic pistol is good AF
[1:08:26] <ultran122> SLIMERS
[1:08:26] <derap41> love these enemies
[1:08:28] <$jacob2pop> To be fair the villian of the first game is literally evil business man
[1:08:36] <%AncelDeLambert> maybe a different dimension has them
[1:08:39] <%genepark> Also dr nefarious had American Sign Language interpretation for his genocidal announcements 17 years before president Biden ever did
[1:08:46] <%NovaKnightmare> right there Pat
[1:08:47] <2017y> ra kura riputo a faato
[1:08:47] <%MrP33Ps> psaBlind

[1:09:00] <%toolofparanoia> WATCH THOSE WRIST ROCKETS
[1:09:00] <$SGrim> @knight_verse *** It's the the appearance section.
[1:09:03] <deviljhojho_> genocide for everyone!
[1:09:05] <deviljhojho_> wait
[1:09:05] <+neonNeptunian> the original R&C games were brutal satire on capitalism
[1:09:08] <SaltyAzteca> gottem
[1:09:10] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[1:09:15] <+morningmoondude> i love how enemies celebrate when they hit one. One fucker dabbed on me.
[1:09:19] <2017y> wheres the hot grey ratchet
[1:09:20] <%ansterdamn> YES
[1:09:22] <%genepark> Genocide4All
[1:09:23] <%CommanderSqueaks> Dr. Nefarious gives paternity leave, he is factually less evil than Jeff Bezos.
[1:09:27] <%MaxeusTheFirst> Seriously, how is Dr. Nefarious the bad guy again? I played the games as a kid but dont remember why...
[1:09:27] <deviljhojho_> literally getting dabbed on

[1:10:13] <2017y> that was two loadscreens .. three.. four
[1:10:14] <UnImprest> my game froze during this the first time :(

[1:14:55] <+Rafraud> Ocd time
[1:15:00] <%miguelrod777> now you can kill this world and not feel bad bc they are robots
[1:15:02] <+JasonTheJazz> is this Samurai Jack?
[1:15:03] <MechanizedGentleman> the perfect society
[1:15:06] <Pookiedaexzile> Only Pat could see a place with all robots and go "yeah this is ideal"
[1:15:07] <%Ranryu692> Bender won
[1:15:08] <+tweedler92> Pat's ideal society
[1:15:09] <gslayer14> it's robotnik all over again
[1:15:09] <kozboz96> @PatStaresAt nefarious HATES organics
[1:15:12] <%RoboticAnimeDude> @2017y you play both
[1:15:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> All robots and they appear to be warming themselves on the corpses of their fellow citizens
[1:15:14] <deviljhojho_> not only that but its a ratchet and clank game as one of the super titles of one of the most sought after consoles right now
[1:15:15] <+pectusumbra> I mean isn't that the bad guy's MO?
[1:15:15] <+BIumen> pat not finding the raritaniums hurts but i shall grit my teeth through it
[1:15:15] <+brightman42> should be cleaner

[1:15:17] <T_Sasquatch> wow pat , thats robtist ?
[1:15:18] <%radda343> Oops All Robits
[1:15:21] <SixthShinx> Nefarious wants an all robot nation
[1:15:21] <%blastyoboots> Oh wait those are HOBO ROBOTS around sparking junk campfires aren't they
[1:15:21] <%AzureGale> The classic mechanic
[1:15:21] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Like, squishy is literally a slur against organics in these games
[1:15:21] <%linSP> what if you were robot all along
[1:15:23] <Aeroallways> the squishies got squished
[1:15:23] <%Dfreddy8> BOXES
[1:15:25] <+FoolsArcade> you always held it
[1:15:27] <+chimaera24> @PatStaresAt Nefarious' plan in his first appearance was to replace all organic life with robots
[1:15:29] <SaltyAzteca> CRANK DAT
[1:15:32] <%toolofparanoia> Mankind is dead, Hell is Full, Blood is fuel
[1:15:32] <viewtifulr> Oops all auto-blows

[1:15:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course Pat would love this place
[1:15:57] <MillaMoks> So then this is the dimension where nefarious and britney gears' plan works I guess
[1:16:00] <deviljhojho_> if you dont count the totalitaianism its real hot
[1:16:02] <%Monkeyweed21> pat missed boxes
[1:16:04] <Pookiedaexzile> CyberPunk 2077 looks like it shaped up after those patches

[1:27:12] <%SpontaneousC> No. the gray wall by the side objective
[1:27:13] <%MisterRockett> This is how every planet in every R&C game works. A centralized hub with paths to levels that are either main or optional missions.

[1:27:31] <avidneptune> The sparkly blue wall
[1:27:38] <+Jack8274> yeah
[1:27:42] <Zero_Jacks> Should have said "Curved wall"
[1:27:43] <ScottyScotch> He meant the hexagon filled wall towards the optional mission
[1:27:53] <%doctordinkus> Glowy electrical wall
[1:27:57] <+Buzzkill983> You go that way, I'll go home
[1:28:05] <%Ranryu692> there was a prompt on the stall you passed
[1:28:11] <Forkeye> y

[1:28:31] <%MidnightBurst12> fancy

[1:28:32] <StarMechV> Time for a mini platform challenge
[1:28:33] <Thepothero> Holy shit I’m marking out over how pretty it is
[1:28:34] <ScottyScotch> Yeah, you should at least do this first main quest then explore. (It makes exploring easier)

[1:28:43] <%Dfreddy8> Of course he missed it
[1:28:44] <Forkeye> this isnt Bethesda pat
[1:28:46] <%Undenizen> if all money goes to the government, doesn't that make Nefarious a communist?
[1:28:48] <scarman125> wait does this mean everybody at the parade just fucking died?
[1:28:56] <T_Sasquatch> oh nooooooo

[1:29:46] <%toolofparanoia> HE TALKS!
[1:29:51] <+kullumanati> I love the PS card implementation for people with mind goblins
[1:29:55] <deviljhojho_> mr fungi is legit a fantastic weapon
[1:30:02] <deviljhojho_> i still use it end game
[1:30:05] <+johnnychopsocky> haha the balloon deforms at the point of impact
[1:30:05] <%Undenizen> @Robot_Nixon_ exactly! all money goes to the government, meaning all property is nationalized
[1:30:06] <%AzureGale> GET ARMOR
[1:30:07] <+fugatlas> the turret weapons are meant to supplement dps more so then be your main attacks
[1:30:12] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Mr. Fungi is basically that party Slurm slug from Futurama. Has to act like he wants to party but he is tired and hates his job. Also you can use other weapons while he is active
[1:30:13] <+NickHatesSnow> Oh man I wanna see Pat react to Mr. Zurkon
[1:30:17] <+Jack8274> Cute
[1:30:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Armor also has bonuses
[1:30:30] <+thegreenbenis> That's pretty cute.
[1:30:30] <Pookiedaexzile> A roboBitch if you will
[1:30:31] <Mariakko> Beep boop I hate the squishies
[1:30:32] <%toolofparanoia> heck yeah!
[1:30:33] <%Pandybun> I've been gone for 30 minutes. What have I missed?
[1:30:35] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt Helmets auto-deactivate in cutscenes, so you don't have to worry about that
[1:30:36] <devanmuse> @NickHatesSnow Mr Zurkon's the fucking best
[1:30:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> @Undenizen truly the utopia we need Kappa
[1:30:37] <%ansterdamn> oh hey there's an al float LUL
[1:30:39] <%MidnightBurst12> Adorable
[1:30:43] <kingofjibs> Why does mr.fungi look so stoned?
[1:30:44] <s1rcuit> that's a cool effect
[1:30:45] <scarman125> that's trippy
[1:30:46] <MonsterGills> you don't to need to wear the armor for the bonus stuff
[1:30:54] <$Ziegsy> you dint have to equip the stuff for the bonuses right?
[1:30:56] <+fugatlas> armor sets have bonuses, but they're applied upon collection, not equipment. You have the buffs of all of your armor even if you don't wear them.
[1:30:56] <TourettesPlays> Sounds like the music has a bit more effort put into it than the PS4 game
[1:30:57] <+thegreenbenis> That's really sick
[1:30:57] <+bluguu> charming
[1:30:57] <mattdaddyd101> you can change the color
[1:30:59] <+NickHatesSnow> @devanmuse Mr. Zurkon is the best
[1:31:05] <stormhawk9891> Glide
[1:31:07] <+Jack8274> You can make that
[1:31:09] <rosemon5001> you can change the color and you dont have to wear a piece to get the bonus from it @PatStaresAt
[1:31:09] <+BeatsWithKev> I'll never get used to that effect
[1:31:17] <deviljhojho_> the music was made by one of the DEVO guys actually
[1:31:21] <thelonechris> YEYEYEYE
[1:31:23] <deviljhojho_> i thought that was interesting
[1:31:25] <%AzureGale> LUL
[1:31:27] <MechanizedGentleman> There you go THINKIN again
[1:31:28] <%CalderGaming> yeah i was right there with you pat
[1:31:30] <%Shubreaker> snapcubeGolt snapcubeGolt
[1:31:41] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> oh, that's nie
[1:31:41] <%DianaTheAscian> oh cool
[1:31:43] <%AzureGale> Get them shaders
[1:31:43] <+thegreenbenis> Sick
[1:31:45] <StarMechV> These are purely cosmetic
[1:31:45] <+johnnychopsocky> the mystic is by Mark Mothersbaugh.  From DEVO and Thor Ragnarok
[1:31:49] <%Undenizen> i dunno. he gives his workers good benefits and he's a huge communist. are we SURE Nefarious is the villain? You're just a furry with a gun.
[1:31:49] <+Romuken> do up your arsenal colors
[1:31:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Apparently, once you get the whole set, you don't need to actively wear it to get the bonus.
[1:31:50] <TourettesPlays> @deviljhojho_ Mark Mothersbaugh? He does a ton of stuff, like Rugrats
[1:31:59] <%Dfreddy8> missed again
[1:32:01] <+Romuken> wait no do your pants
[1:32:09] <+BIumen> pat are you avoiding the pixilizer because pre-order because i sure as hell got it without a pre-order
[1:32:13] <deviljhojho_> @TourettesPlays probably, i haven't listened to anything that isnt whip it
[1:32:14] <Louie_Salmon> Wacky, even
[1:32:15] <+Romuken> no
[1:32:16] <+LastnameSilverLastname> NO loading screen! PogChampo
[1:32:17] <+Romuken> im sorry pat
[1:32:25] <%Dakuu75> Do these games still have skill points?
[1:32:26] <+Romuken> Make the helmet into your pants colors
[1:32:27] <+Jack8274> true
[1:32:28] <%Taisuru> You don't have to wear them to get the stat buffs btw
[1:32:36] <deviljhojho_> it actually doesnt do anything right?
[1:32:43] <+brightman42> it's just cosmetic
[1:32:43] <%Dfreddy8> There's raretium in the riff
[1:32:46] <%ssjklyco> The preorder stuff doesn't give stat buffs
[1:32:46] <deviljhojho_> yeah they activate regardless of what you have
[1:32:48] <rosemon5001> it doesnt have a bonus you only look cool whit the pre order one @PatStaresAt
[1:32:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes
[1:32:49] <%DorianCreed> It's all purely cosmetic, and has an associated stat buff with pickup
[1:32:49] <+johnnychopsocky> I really don't think the Pixelizer is preorder.  I think it's just there
[1:32:50] <+Raspada_Ryner> Pure cosmetic
[1:32:51] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt IT's not cheating cause that armor is just cosmetics.
[1:32:53] <%sabertoothzombie> yup
[1:32:56] <+SolidusRex> The preorder costume is cosmetic
[1:32:57] <blackjack8182> Cheat
[1:33:00] <+dramajoe> left
[1:33:01] <%AzureGale> Yeah the armor is cosmetic
[1:33:01] <%Dfreddy8> Left
[1:33:01] <+Javaa01> Turn the camera left
[1:33:03] <ScottyScotch> It’s purely cosmetic. It technically is already applying the buffs
[1:33:04] <StarMechV> ONE GUY
[1:33:06] <%bevyrage> shoot floating crates
[1:33:07] <%Undenizen> I hope theyere
[1:33:11] <+TyphonTwister> The pre-order stuff is cosmetic
[1:33:15] <+Rafraud> I DIDNT KNOW THAT
[1:33:16] <+dramajoe> thats the only one
[1:33:18] <+brightman42> that was it
[1:33:21] <%MrP33Ps> that's the only one there
[1:33:21] <%chiluzza> the goblins
[1:33:24] <+Raspada_Ryner> That's the only one
[1:33:26] <lowercasejai> NEFARIOUS..
[1:33:31] <%sabertoothzombie> that was it
[1:33:34] <%xMaSterKeef420bluntNinjAx> Oh no Pat's Mind Goblins are going to be fucked by this game
[1:33:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> NOW YOU'RE THINKING WITH PORTALS
[1:33:39] <Pookiedaexzile> He doesn't belive chat
[1:33:41] <deviljhojho_> brain 2 big
[1:33:42] <%CalderGaming> thanks level design
[1:33:42] <ultran122> is the audo desynched for anyone else?
[1:33:43] <+Raspada_Ryner> They usually have the raritaniums at the beginning of those rifts
[1:33:43] <%Ranryu692> YOu're certainly something
[1:33:45] <+Jack8274> Tensei Pa
[1:33:45] <%Dfreddy8> You are so SMRT PATRICK

[1:34:03] <+Rafraud> No
[1:34:04] <%psidefx> yes
[1:34:04] <%AzureGale> Absolutely
[1:34:06] <+BIumen> you can just go back ye

[1:34:24] <%AzureGale> Yeah, there's no permanently missable content
[1:34:28] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt Nothing in this game is missable
[1:34:30] <ScottyScotch> Ehhh kinda. It’s usually your choice.
[1:34:30] <Profmcstevie> It's a 3D platformer with guns, collecting is part of the fun
[1:34:31] <+SolidusRex> You can ALWAYS backtrack
[1:34:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> You also get checklists to help you find everything
[1:34:33] <Pookiedaexzile> You can come back? GOTYRN
[1:34:33] <Manwad> you can go back, and the mapomatic is in this game, just like all the others
[1:34:36] <+Jack8274> The rumble is nuts
[1:34:41] <%Dfreddy8> In helmet voice is a nice touch.

[1:49:50] <%AncelDeLambert> welp, time to sell a kidney
[1:50:00] <viewtifulr> sphere grid time doodLUL
[1:50:06] <+brightman42> chain select is helpful as fuck
[1:50:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Of course Tidus would get a sphere grid.
[1:50:14] <MechanizedGentleman> "Tutorializer" LUL
[1:50:18] <+NekoDraga> Use Triangle to chain select
[1:50:18] <+johnnychopsocky> chain select is wonderful
[1:50:25] <LoreKeeper_Thal> you can triangle to chain select
[1:50:28] <deviljhojho_> raritanium upgrades make all the difference
[1:50:28] <+ImmaterialHero> @PatStaresAt triangle lets you select multiple upgrades at once
[1:50:36] <reonome> PogChamp
[1:50:37] <+SolidusRex> You can chain select with Triangle
[1:50:37] <+morningmoondude> MAKE FUNGUY BIG AND STRONK
[1:50:39] <%blastyoboots> Tidus needs his sphere grids!
[1:50:40] <+fetrigon> KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype KomodoHype
[1:50:41] <%AncelDeLambert> thank you, nice lady
[1:50:44] <mass1997> I guess?
[1:50:44] <StarMechV> Welcome to Baby 1st Sphere Grid
[1:50:46] <%DorianCreed> FURRY TIDUS AND HIS DAKKA SPHERE GRID
[1:50:46] <%AzureGale> That is a hexagonal License Board
[1:50:47] <ammobasket> more like a license board
[1:50:48] <Pookiedaexzile> They aren't fucking around
[1:50:49] <%ssjklyco> Tip is once you level a gun, level the grid around the yellow to proc the perks.
[1:50:50] <+NickHatesSnow> the goblins will be fed
[1:50:52] <+Buzzkill983> This reminds me of Dead space upgrades too
[1:50:53] <$invisi_bliss> that's kind of a sphere grid a little bit
[1:50:54] <Thepothero> Baby s 1st POE screen
[1:50:54] <cgreene64> More like FF12
[1:50:56] <+neonNeptunian> more level = more slots
[1:51:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> Also, Pat, if you notice the upgrade maps kind of look like the weapon itself.
[1:51:01] <deviljhojho_> i just do my favorites
[1:51:02] <ScottyScotch> Tip: while you should eventually get every weapon, do keep an eye on what’s coming up since their price will eventually be more than the money you’ll collect per “mission.” TLDR sometimes save your money for future weapons
[1:51:05] <%spitelite> is this dq11 now
[1:51:05] <+Jack8274> It's really good when upgraded
[1:51:05] <marvel877> MINDGOBLINS INTENSIFY
[1:51:07] <viewtifulr> Wait this feels more like the License  grid from 12
[1:51:18] <s1rcuit> just like Pat
[1:51:18] <+jerkhov> butt stallion
[1:51:19] <ammobasket> sphere grid is much more linear
[1:51:37] <mattro_23> YOU HAVE TO SURRROUND THE GOLDEN ONES TO UNLOCK THEM
[1:51:40] <%ssjklyco> Raratarium is also easy to grind  for, so don't worry about searching for crates in levels.
[1:51:42] <MechanizedGentleman> Much Faster, More Shooterer
[1:51:44] <Pookiedaexzile> I want it all.....and I want it now
[1:51:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> Enforcer is Big Wide.
[1:51:54] <romc215> Man, I haven't played a Ratchet and Clank in years
[1:51:58] <%GalacticaPhanto> @mattro_23 bro stop
[1:51:58] <deviljhojho_> real gun
[1:51:59] <%Eilocke> Big McLongwide
[1:52:10] <+brightman42> use triangle
[1:52:12] <deviljhojho_> yeah
[1:52:14] <Yakobro> :)
[1:52:14] <+BIumen> eventually
[1:52:16] <%ssjklyco> Yes
[1:52:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, a neat little thing is that the upgrade chart looks like a rough outline of the weapon itself.
[1:52:17] <$Ziegsy> Bigger longness? Stop reading your emails pat
[1:52:19] <+Javaa01> You unlock more of the grid as you level the weapon
[1:52:20] <%Nobrev> @mattro_23 yo chill
[1:52:22] <+jetrouverai> yeah you have to level the gun up to unlock extra bits
[1:52:22] <johnthegg> yeah they fill out as you level it
[1:52:22] <%ssjklyco> Hgher levels open them
[1:52:24] <+Ldubz88> increase the lenght
[1:52:25] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt The grid expands as you progress
[1:52:25] <+fugatlas> As weapons level up you unlock more potential upgrades
[1:52:27] <+ChaosEmralds> no
[1:52:27] <mattdaddyd101> A wider Enforce
[1:52:27] <kozboz96> @PatStaresAt raise gun level grid gets bigger
[1:52:27] <+NekoDraga> Probably once you level them up more
[1:52:28] <+johnnychopsocky> I've been concentrating on 4 weapons at a time.  Level them up, then buy new ones to swap them out once they're leveled
[1:52:28] <wujak> leveling the gun up gives more nodes
[1:52:30] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt When a weapon upgrades with EXP it opens new grids
[1:52:33] <+pectusumbra> anything on the hexes
[1:52:34] <johnthegg> yep
[1:52:35] <%AzureGale> Yep

[1:52:36] <%Tearonex> yes
[1:52:36] <%sjay662> yes
[1:52:36] <%psidefx> yes
[1:52:37] <%logoth_> why does ratchet and clank have the sphere grid
[1:52:37] <%ssjklyco> Yes
[1:52:38] <+brightman42> yeah
[1:52:39] <+SolidusRex> Yes
[1:52:40] <+neonNeptunian> yes!
[1:52:43] <+pectusumbra> it's hexes to help make it clear
[1:52:43] <+NickHatesSnow> yes
[1:52:44] <+Mintios> yep
[1:52:44] <+ChaosEmralds> you dont need that first part in the chain
[1:52:45] <+morningmoondude> Yes, but you're doing 1 more than needed

[1:58:19] <+pectusumbra> Poor fungi. It's just slurms mckenzie again
[1:58:21] <%walternatorz> I wonder if a Doom dev will see this game and think that bringing the portals to you is a great idea

[1:58:30] <Phob05> Mr Fungi is basically Slurms McKenzy
[1:58:39] <%ape_hawk> you ARE distracting them, from being alive
[1:58:41] <deviljhojho_> murder is fine if its robots
[1:58:42] <romc215> Death is the ultimate distraction
[1:58:44] <%AzureGale> Death is the ultimate distraction
[1:58:49] <+wizard_of_diamonds> @Phob05 I WAS JUST THINKING THAT
[1:58:51] <StarMechV> they are evil robots it fine
[1:58:52] <%Monkeyweed21> they arent people

[2:00:12] <romc215> The detail on Ratchet's fur, wow
[2:00:13] <+fugatlas> Can we talk about how fungi dying in the cutscene means this is a live in engine cutscene and not prerendered
[2:00:15] <deviljhojho_> crikTrask

[2:00:37] <%ansterdamn> cool factor
[2:00:37] <%doc_ock_rokc> @T_Sasquatch more or less yes
[2:00:38] <+allups> ganna take it down from the inside man
[2:00:38] <reonome> @fugatlas nothing we have seen so far has been prerendered

[2:01:02] <viewtifulr> I gotta tell wakka
[2:01:06] <%ape_hawk> do you think ratchet would go down on himself?
[2:01:07] <%HunguyTV> He exploded in a cutscene so that means its permanent
[2:01:10] <reonome> @viewtifulr oh shit this IS FF10!!
[2:01:13] <%Monkeyweed21> Congrats you murdered a bunch of spa guests

[2:01:36] <%AzureGale> REMEMBER THIS AREA
[2:01:37] <mattro_23> NO YOU CAN COLLECT ALL THE STUFF YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME
[2:01:38] <%bevyrage> was that raritarium up on the left side of the rail?
[2:01:44] <%ansterdamn> the grind rail sections were some of my favourites in these games LUL
[2:01:50] <+Javaa01> And now you have the gear you need to do that optional objective
[2:01:51] <+SolidusRex> Do the optional area now
[2:01:52] <%ape_hawk> so rails are the new loading screens, got it
[2:01:54] <mattro_23> ALSO YOU CAN NOW DO THE SIDE QUEST
[2:01:55] <$Ziegsy> this is only ffx if nefarious is ratchets dad

[2:02:23] <+Rosy_Joan> sOUL SURGE!
[2:02:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Richard Horvitz had so much fun with this role.
[2:02:24] <hraezlyrnoyaiba> Crystal lance
[2:02:26] <viewtifulr> the what zim?
[2:02:26] <+NickHatesSnow> SHINING LASER FROM MEGAMAN LEGENDS
[2:02:27] <$StrawberryPantsu> Even at 1080p
[2:02:29] <notsoy> BIG LASER
[2:02:29] <heart_ablaze> its a megaman
[2:02:30] <Louie_Salmon> More invader Zim, never enough zim
[2:02:30] <%Wallabri> .....Rcihard Horvitz?
[2:02:33] <%Dfreddy8> DEFINITELY NO MURDER
[2:02:34] <stantheman_97> cmonBruh
[2:02:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> Might buy a PS5 Next Tax Season
[2:02:37] <$manwithboxonhead> It might as well say buy this and you win the game.
[2:02:40] <+morningmoondude> one of the few weapons i didn't max out. In hard mode it just doesn't do enough damage for its windup
[2:02:42] <tengel66> kind of sounds like an Angry Beaver
[2:02:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Yes, that is Richard Horvitz.
[2:02:44] <MechanizedGentleman> Stop being Poor, pat
[2:02:44] <deviljhojho_> THATS RIGHT PAT
[2:02:47] <RaidenRising> A WHAt
[2:02:53] <deviljhojho_> dont even look at it
[2:02:54] <%psidefx> Pat its so good tho
[2:02:54] <ScottyScotch> Now you should do the options mission since it will be a slight bit of time before you get control of ratchet again. (Like 1 medium long mission)
[2:02:55] <+allups> its a shooter game man
[2:02:56] <+brightman42> it gets better
[2:02:56] <+NickHatesSnow> Pistols are amazing in this series
[2:02:56] <StarMechV> the burst pistol does become good later on
[2:02:56] <+ChaosEmralds> burst pistol is pretty good in this game.
[2:02:58] <%Monkeyweed21> THATS CORRECT
[2:02:59] <%ArcanumArcanum> burst pistol is good, just upgrade the fire rate
[2:03:02] <romc215> Pistols are rarely worth it
[2:03:04] <%AzureGale> YEYEYEYE
[2:03:08] <%RoboticAnimeDude> its alright if you max it, but useless later on
[2:03:12] <%athuramn> burst pistol upgrades to be amazing
[2:03:14] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> money me money me please
[2:03:15] <avidneptune> It’s better than most Ratchet pistols
[2:03:22] <+NickHatesSnow> People who hate pistols never upgrade them
[2:03:25] <%ape_hawk> PURCHASING DATA
[2:03:27] <%Dfreddy8> CASH
[2:03:27] <deviljhojho_> burst pirstol is good in a game with amazing guns
[2:03:32] <%bevyrage> oh hey you can get the stuff over there now
[2:03:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> All that is money is money
[2:03:36] <StarMechV> That's not the way
[2:03:37] <+pectusumbra> I bet you'll have enough by the time you do the sidequest
[2:03:44] <%ape_hawk> nefarious rose in power by becoming jeff bezos
[2:03:58] <%AzureGale> GOLD BOLT
[2:04:01] <+Rafraud> R3 for objectives Pat
[2:04:04] <romc215> to be fair, in most games the pistols are just starter weapons, place holders until you get a rifle or something with better range and accuracy
[2:04:06] <ScottyScotch> “Uh oh.” (Stream proceeds to crash on my end)
[2:04:07] <deviljhojho_> d-dont worry about it

[2:05:46] <$Ziegsy> @doc_ock_rokc theres a heartbeat under my skin?
[2:05:56] <%MisterTylerrr> Ratchet must have real strong knees
[2:06:00] <deviljhojho_> it is real polished
[2:06:00] <xeros720> oh yeah, has pat had a chance to kill chaos yet?
[2:06:00] <%AzureGale> Indeed
[2:06:05] <superzebra101> its weird seeing so many npcs in a ratchet and clank game
[2:06:10] <mattro_23> GO UP TO DO THE SIDE QUEST
[2:06:12] <+allups> the number of npcs is cool
[2:06:14] <BinaryShuffle> silky smooth
[2:06:15] <Giztech> it's what cyberpunk wanted to be
[2:06:17] <MechanizedGentleman> Look at the fucking accurate reflections in the puddles @PatStaresAt
[2:06:19] <deviljhojho_> thats 4 out of 4 for PS5 exlusives
[2:06:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Ziegsy search my electric soul for the inner man within
[2:06:24] <+Mintios> I love this series
[2:06:25] <Ultimatefool> Cyberpunk could have been this
[2:06:29] <+ChaosEmralds> yup
[2:06:33] <%bevyrage> always is
[2:06:34] <ScottyScotch> Gold bolt #6 is almost mandatory IMO (just find 6, not a specific one).
[2:06:34] <+Romuken> koboldWhat
[2:06:36] <Profmcstevie> Perhaps playing so much of Mass Effect has boosted the impression of this MODERN VIDYA GAME
[2:06:37] <mephium> a little bit more content yeah
[2:06:39] <$SGrim> @Ultimatefool should*
[2:06:41] <superzebra101> dear god this one has newgame plus also im getting this game for sure lol
[2:06:41] <Afterman_> new game plus with content is always a godsend
[2:06:43] <StarMechV> It gives you a money multiplier and a extra weapon
[2:06:43] <+NickHatesSnow> Yeah NG+ always has better weapon upgrades
[2:06:45] <+jetrouverai> yeah the weapons get op in ng+
[2:06:46] <$Ziegsy> @doc_ock_rokc Ayyy! a person of culture!
[2:06:49] <Dova573> you guys thinks playing the future trilogy on psnow play ok
[2:06:50] <s1rcuit> New Game + has been in literally every Ratchet and Clank game
[2:06:50] <Dova573> ?
[2:06:53] <%HollowBeansVG> wait which part of the name is he?
[2:06:53] <%ansterdamn> i wonder if you can still prestige the weapons...
[2:06:53] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> HE IS?!
[2:06:57] <StarMechV> You're literally in the first level Pat
[2:06:58] <TioXyco> it is?!
[2:07:00] <%hat_under_bread> Pat. You're blowing my mind right now.
[2:07:00] <auraofdawn> the future trilogy had a whole game without him
[2:07:00] <xeros720> ratchet and not clank
[2:07:01] <%HunguyTV> This isn't Ratchet and Fungi?
[2:07:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt thats KINDA a issue with recent Rachet and clank games. Rachet and clank are rarely together
[2:07:05] <+thegreenbenis> No he isn't, you liar.
[2:07:06] <%AzureGale> In A Crack In Time, you spent the majority of the game without Clank
[2:07:06] <Profmcstevie> He has not been a staple as much as you think
[2:07:11] <huskarl_zap> Clank wasn't playable in the arena game
[2:07:14] <%Robot_Nixon_> Ratchet and just Ratchet FeelsBadMan
[2:07:15] <StarMechV> This game is so fun
[2:07:16] <%miguelrod777> really damn clank from rachet and clank is an important character damn
[2:07:18] <avidneptune> Crack in Time R and C are apar for like 3/4 of the game
[2:07:19] <romc215> There were even reflections in the puddles on the ground
[2:07:19] <%Garthunox> he wasnt in gladiator at all
[2:07:22] <mephium> rivet
[2:07:24] <StarMechV> Rivet
[2:07:30] <TioXyco> with female rac=tchet
[2:07:31] <Daxalog> Also the music being weaker.
[2:07:31] <%Garthunox> well, as a partner he wasnt
[2:07:32] <%MelBrooksKA> Waifu
[2:07:33] <%AzureGale> Ratchet: Rift Apart
[2:07:37] <%Robot_Nixon_> girl ratchet
[2:07:45] <+Rafraud> If you press R3 it tells you where to go without pausing
[2:07:47] <+D00msDayDan> ratchet: clank apart
[2:07:51] <+allups> not really a problem if its good
[2:07:52] <+morningmoondude> Pat playing this like it's pokemon
[2:07:53] <%ansterdamn> fun go up
[2:07:57] <%spitelite> ratchet and funguy
[2:07:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> So is this a NEW Fungi every time you use it or is it the same Fungi?
[2:08:01] <romc215> You gotta level up Fungi, he's your fun guy, until you get Clank back
[2:08:04] <%AzureGale> No bulli the robot
[2:08:12] <%MisterTylerrr> And all that money spent on a fancy shotgun, and you wanna play with shrooms
[2:08:14] <%bhp_99> Go where the fun is
[2:08:18] <+allups> What if this was Wall-E
[2:08:19] <auraofdawn> ratchet & fungi: 2 fast 2 fungi
[2:08:19] <thelonechris> It's a hive mind

[2:08:23] <+MGSKomodoDragon> Like a Meeseeks box?
[2:08:24] <pilllowofbees> fun guy is born to die
[2:08:29] <%Ynkubus_> Theres always spore where they came from
[2:08:29] <%ansterdamn> they're meeseeks?
[2:08:30] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt Every weapon caps at level 5 where they gain a new name and extra ability. Once you reach NG+ you can level them up even further to lv 10
[2:08:35] <Afterman_> each fungi, upon expulsion, leave behind an egg.
[2:08:38] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt technically all fungi are clones of the same fungi so....it might be the same fungui
[2:08:39] <avidneptune> Fun never stops
[2:08:41] <%psidefx> Mr. Fungi is here for a good time not a long time
[2:08:42] <karovus> they die doing what they love: murder
[2:08:42] <Manwad> he's a mushroom, they clone themselves, it's fine
[2:08:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Born to die, world is a fuck, 6 billion dead fungis
[2:08:52] <s1rcuit> probably from a single spore producing Mr. Funguis
[2:08:53] <%AzureGale> LUL
[2:08:56] <Dova573> Honestly Mr Meesek box would be a ratchet an clank weapon
[2:09:05] <%MisterTylerrr> Tuesdays are my fridays.  So I get that feeling.
[2:09:07] <auraofdawn> its wednesday my dude
[2:09:07] <+Proxzo> They crave only two things: Violence and the sweet release of death.
[2:09:07] <%impacteddarrien> impacteddarrien subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! Silent Hill let's plays are getting me through the pandemic
[2:09:10] <+morningmoondude> balls
[2:09:13] <deviljhojho_> did you know? aproximately four hundred trillion copies of mr fungi die every second!
[2:09:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can we talk about how refreshing it is that Ratchet is just a nice person? Like not snarky, not snippy, he's just NICE.
[2:09:19] <deviljhojho_> wow!
[2:09:25] <StarMechV> Everything breakable give money it's like the LEGO games
[2:09:25] <%DianaTheAscian> Pat has found is dream land
[2:09:30] <+Proxzo> Oh also you can put out multiple fungis
[2:09:31] <%DianaTheAscian> his*
[2:09:37] <deviljhojho_> ratchet is just a swell guy
[2:09:44] <%Dakuu75> truth
[2:09:46] <%HunguyTV> I love it
[2:09:46] <+NickHatesSnow> THAT'S THE SERIES
[2:09:52] <$StrawberryPantsu> BIG BUDGET SONY GAME!
[2:09:54] <s1rcuit> good, that's how a game should make you feel
[2:09:57] <%AzureGale> You're gonna love it. I guarantee it.
[2:10:02] <%PigGuy800> PigGuy800 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 17 months! 
[2:10:06] <Dova573> Ratchet just wanted to fix his ship and be pilot
[2:10:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> Its not
[2:10:06] <%MisterTylerrr> Doesn't matter.
[2:10:07] <farrellcityking> This is the next gen of next gen gen of next
[2:10:09] <%doc_ock_rokc> but still good
[2:10:12] <nesbitt22> Pat will Jak and Dexter ever make a comeback?
[2:10:14] <deviljhojho_> i love sony money sometimes
[2:10:16] <romc215> As long as it gets done, right?
[2:10:16] <T_Sasquatch> @CommanderSqueaks if i recall old ratchet is kinda obnoxious LUL
[2:10:18] <+Rafraud> Its not lmao
[2:10:19] <+allups> that makes game good
[2:10:26] <%saadi90> Can’t wait for the new sunset overdrive. Insomniac doing awesome
[2:10:27] <%Dakuu75> dude, these boot-feets sfx are really good
[2:10:28] <T_Sasquatch> @nesbitt22 AHAHHAHHAHAH no
[2:10:37] <IanThatKoboldMiner> Most ratchet and clank are solid.
[2:10:37] <s1rcuit> @nesbitt22 no, 3 had a pretty conclusive end
[2:10:37] <+Rafraud> Game has alot of skips right now
[2:10:39] <avidneptune> Speedrun strats
[2:10:40] <+fugatlas> jak and daxters whole plot kinda got wrapped up with 3, and when they tried to expand on it with X it was p bad
[2:10:44] <BigFingerRo> Hey @PatStaresAt I feel obligated to ask, in a way that you have been in the distant past: When are you gonna play some DOGSHIT again?
[2:10:48] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt BTW you can totally wall-jump off something then dash back to it for some extra height
[2:10:54] <juanrock89> gold bolt behind
[2:10:55] <%hat_under_bread> Yeah. It's the emperor's cornbread recipe.
[2:10:56] <+Proxzo> what if you put out like 3 Mr. Fungis
[2:10:58] <ilpeggiore_> this looks really good
[2:10:59] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> 23 huhn
[2:11:02] <kikoeru_san> THIS LOOKS LIKE A TECH DEMO
[2:11:05] <%doc_ock_rokc> 23 hours a day work
[2:11:05] <nyacoo> better question will Sly Cooper ever make a comeback
[2:11:11] <+D00msDayDan> that spybot has the emperor's feet pics
[2:11:14] <+morningmoondude> it's useful when you *just* miss a jump
[2:11:15] <Daxalog> Nope
[2:11:16] <+neonNeptunian> dang, that spore cloud effect is sick too
[2:11:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> @BigFingerRo dogshit? WutFace
[2:11:21] <nesbitt22> T_T no more Jak
[2:11:21] <ilpeggiore_> like REALLY good
[2:11:22] <rektasaurus_rekts> Woo! reminds me of my 13 hours shift's!
[2:11:23] <+allups> looks great
[2:11:30] <+Romuken> i can smell a gold nut in this room or the one prior
[2:11:37] <MonsterGills> it robot pat
[2:11:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Robot workers rights!
[2:11:42] <%AzureGale> No bulli da robot
[2:11:43] <thelonechris> Amazon warehouse
[2:11:50] <StarMechV> Pat relates to that robot because its dumb short and round
[2:11:50] <Afterman_> ooh ooh here's my theory! the thing rivet stole in the beginning? I bet that is emperor nefarious' mind
[2:11:53] <fairore> @fugatlas that wasnt x man that was frontier
[2:11:54] <BigFingerRo> @Robot_Nixon_ I'm referencing the opening lines of the Ride to Hell LP
[2:12:03] <T_Sasquatch> mascot platormers are a thing of the past
[2:12:04] <+allups> when do u get the grapple hook
[2:12:20] <s1rcuit> @allups he started with it
[2:12:22] <%athuramn> nailed it
[2:12:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> Man, Jeff Bezos really went off the deep end in 2025.
[2:12:27] <%Robot_Nixon_> @BigFingerRo ah just curious what game you meant
[2:12:27] <%democrazyyy> 17 hours til lunch break oof
[2:12:32] <StarMechV> You can use the wall run backwards no matter the arrows
[2:12:34] <%Kitafin> first floor
[2:12:39] <+D00msDayDan> wow on-rails wallrunning
[2:12:46] <Dunmarkh> get the nut pat
[2:12:53] <BigFingerRo> @democrazyyy and you get 5 mins, so make em count
[2:12:55] <Dunmarkh> nut
[2:13:01] <MechanizedGentleman> Mr Fungi has real Slurms McKenzie energy
[2:13:03] <+FoolsArcade> Pat literally ignoring boxes
[2:13:06] <+allups> funji looks stoned
[2:13:08] <+Romuken> missed a gold bolt in the 1st conveyor room
[2:13:09] <+pectusumbra> walked by some boxes for nuts
[2:13:09] <%psidefx> Pokemon Diamond remake looks great
[2:13:11] <+MajorCrasher> missed boxes
[2:13:12] <Afterman_> the fungus weapon is basically just a killer nut
[2:13:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Place bets on Pat using only Fungi to try and defeat the final boss.
[2:13:14] <+pectusumbra> or bolts, whatever
[2:13:16] <+Javaa01> @PatStaresAt You can totally run backwards on those wallrun walls, the arrows are just for signposting purposes
[2:13:28] <+allups> he is scary
[2:13:29] <StarMechV> the enemies just spawned
[2:13:32] <%AzureGale> No, the bad robots are scaring them
[2:13:52] <%CommanderSqueaks> I LOVE how all of the enemies react to the specific weapons you use.
[2:13:59] <Daxalog> Enemies also seem to be responding to Fungi
[2:13:59] <s1rcuit> @pectusumbra it's random collections of bolts, nuts, etc.
[2:14:04] <+Javaa01> All the main enemies have dialogue for every weapon, and every voiced weapon has dialogue for every enemy faction
[2:14:09] <%AzureGale> Pat is out of fun
[2:14:11] <+TyphonTwister> Yeah, his dialog changes based on who you're fighting too
[2:14:11] <%psidefx> I see what you did there pectus
[2:14:12] <TioXyco> Fungone guy
[2:14:13] <viewtifulr> Also like how the enemies are calling out what weapon you have
[2:14:22] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt When you dash you have invincibility frames
[2:14:39] <%athuramn> the fun never stops... the fun never stops...
[2:14:46] <gslayer14> grenades?
[2:14:48] <+Romuken> I enjoy Mr. Fungi's constant hatred for his job.  "I love having fun, even when I don't wanna!"
[2:14:53] <reonome> THE POWER OF THE PS5
[2:14:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> LOOK AT WHAT NO CRUNCH CAN DO
[2:14:59] <Ner234> Dark Magic
[2:14:59] <kikoeru_san> it's like a tech demo
[2:15:00] <$StrawberryPantsu> POWER OF THE PS5 BAYBEEEEEEEE
[2:15:00] <%ansterdamn> MAGIC
[2:15:01] <%AzureGale> Cause Insomniac are gods at optimization
[2:15:01] <+allups> power of the ps5
[2:15:02] <T_Sasquatch> something something ps5
[2:15:02] <%AncelDeLambert> good engine?
[2:15:03] <%bevyrage> part of it is because rachet & clank is ALWAYS a well optimized game
[2:15:04] <%GalacticaPhanto> cause fuck you that's why
[2:15:04] <nyacoo> polished
[2:15:04] <TioXyco> very good optmization
[2:15:06] <s1rcuit> because the PS5 is apparently a powerhouse
[2:15:07] <+Mintios> good developers
[2:15:07] <%sjay662> insomniac are wizards
[2:15:09] <+TyphonTwister> Insomniac magic
[2:15:10] <+TheLastStar> Optimized AF
[2:15:10] <romc215> good programming and a powerful console
[2:15:11] <%OrangeMDT> Why is the “fun never stops” line so hilariously sad
[2:15:13] <%tactician0> Ps5 good
[2:15:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> It's amazing what you can do without crunch isn't it Pat?
[2:15:16] <+rean_v> this game has slow mo mode in the options too
[2:15:19] <%psidefx> psaBig Optimized
[2:15:19] <%Varlinator> THE PS5 HAS SO MUCH varlin1POWER varlin1POWER varlin1POWER
[2:15:23] <+jetrouverai> one thing I love about this game is that the hardest difficulty can actually fuck you up sometimes
[2:15:24] <kikoeru_san> the power of well payed people that get to see their families
[2:15:24] <Profmcstevie> Insomniac and Naughty Dog were always excellent at optimised games
[2:15:27] <+morningmoondude> Mr Fungi would never drop a frame
[2:15:32] <+BIumen> rip ya a new one
[2:15:34] <%AzureGale> Wait did that spybot enter Ratchet's crotch
[2:15:35] <Strigiform> a game team given time to actually optimize their engine
[2:15:38] <gslayer14> now go through it again
[2:15:38] <+Javaa01> Basically get them all to get the Ryno
[2:15:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt 90% of the textures are generic metal textures.
[2:15:40] <+SocialMisfitGamer> The secret weapon is 100% the RYNO
[2:15:43] <T_Sasquatch> g o b l i n s activated
[2:15:44] <StarMechV> @PatStaresAt If you collect every Spybot youcan obtain the Most Powerful gun in the Game
[2:15:45] <$SGrim> Remember, Cyberpunk was also PS5. It's not the hardware, it's the developer. Also, no crunch.
[2:15:46] <%ansterdamn> RYNO gang
[2:15:47] <BinaryShuffle> RYNO I bet
[2:15:50] <Bigyanno> Is this the power of BLAST PROCESSING!?
[2:15:55] <+Mintios> ryno Pog
[2:15:58] <%Shubreaker> LORE BOTS PogChamp
[2:16:00] <+SocialMisfitGamer> RYNO GANG
[2:16:00] <%Ranryu692> @PatStaresAt Mr. Fungi is voiced by Corporal Richard L. Jenkins from ME1
[2:16:01] <%athuramn> RYNO :D
[2:16:03] <%MisterTylerrr> Artifacts in Ratchet and Klank
[2:16:05] <Daxalog> Which RYNO is the series at now?
[2:16:06] <%bhp_99> You had me at secret weapon
[2:16:06] <ScottyScotch> Trust me, you want that weapon
[2:16:06] <s1rcuit> @Profmcstevie considering they spent a lot of time working together they probably swapped a lot of useful knowledge
[2:16:07] <huskarl_zap> Rip ya new one
[2:16:08] <$Cobra743> RYNO RIP YA A NEW ONE
[2:16:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, it's amazing what you can do with well paid employees who get to see their families, huh?
[2:16:22] <mattro_23> YOU SHOULD LEVEL UP THE BURST PISTOL
[2:16:23] <farrellcityking> Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Sony Santa Monica have reached the next level of gaming development
[2:16:24] <+TyphonTwister> This game is the equivalent of that one Ratatouille scene
[2:16:25] <+SocialMisfitGamer> Rip You a New One
[2:16:25] <%Black_Machete> reno 8
[2:16:28] <%Undenizen> this isn't secret intel, this is a lore dump!
[2:16:33] <+thegreenbenis> This place looks fucking sick.
[2:16:37] <%AzureGale> Yep
[2:16:44] <auraofdawn> yup
[2:16:46] <deviljhojho_> imagine
[2:16:47] <StarMechV> INSOMNAIC SAID THERE WAS NO CRUNCH TO MAKE THIS GAME SO YOU'RE RIGHT PAT
[2:16:47] <%tactician0> fuck lol
[2:16:48] <%Dfreddy8> ONE GAME

[2:16:57] <+allups> and no buggs
[2:16:58] <%AzureGale> This is what you can do when you give the dev teams enough time
[2:16:59] <+Whiskey_T_Foxtrot> Somewhere out there, a Naughty Dog manager is blisteringly angry that this game was released
[2:17:01] <Dunmarkh> alright but max payne 3 was pretty good though
[2:17:02] <Daxalog> Hopefully it gets good unit sales and game of the year tm.
[2:17:03] <$Mekhet09> Imagine what happens then the dev team has stayed on for more then a month.
[2:17:04] <viewtifulr> squeeze the kids for more game juice
[2:17:04] <iosephe> But what about the responsive foliage
[2:17:05] <%DorianCreed> Oh, so THAT'S why the horrificallu evil villain is doing 23/7 crunch
[2:17:06] <Bigyanno> A happy worker is a productive worker
[2:17:07] <%linSP> wait.... crunch DOESNT work???
[2:17:09] <kikoeru_san> you can make a game for kids better when you see your kids
[2:17:10] <xeros720> High morale is indeed a buff
[2:17:13] <thehullowed> Imagine not treating your workers like robots.
[2:17:13] <$StrawberryPantsu> So just the FFXIV dev team @PatStaresAt (And this Dev team)
[2:17:13] <s1rcuit> or impactful moments in their children's development/lives
[2:17:18] <+paladinstarbuster> but what abut horse ball shrinkage THO
[2:17:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> But Pat, this game doesn't have responsive foliage!
[2:17:24] <%MugenSandan> BUT PAT I REALLY NEED TO RENDER THIS GOLF CLUB IMPACTING THE SKULL JUST SO
[2:17:26] <stantheman_97> it's also like people are more productive when they're happy
[2:17:26] <UnImprest> @allups yeah right no bugs
[2:17:35] <%athuramn> nailed it
[2:17:39] <Bigyanno> It's almost like capitalism is the worst way to produce quality products
[2:17:45] <%Monkeyweed21> @PatStaresAt get to the 2nd floor and dash thru the lasers
[2:17:58] <T_Sasquatch> that horse ball shrinkage pisses me off so much. they actually marketed it
[2:18:04] <+neonNeptunian> GOTTEM
[2:18:05] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> deed et
[2:18:06] <%Shubreaker> snapcubeGolt
[2:18:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> Can you dash through the lasers?
[2:18:07] <%MisterTylerrr> Nsilrf iy
[2:18:09] <%AzureGale> Pat is slightly higher
[2:18:11] <s1rcuit> Insomniac has always been proud of their work
[2:18:13] <%MisterTylerrr> Nailed it*
[2:18:13] <viewtifulr> YEAH platforming!
[2:18:17] <+BIumen> that killed me when i tried
[2:18:19] <ergulor> hahahhaa}

[2:18:55] <%AzureGale> Fun fact, Overcharge is from Sunset Overdrive
[2:18:55] <%doc_ock_rokc> Because we all know the soviets created quality things like the Chernobil nuclear reactor
[2:18:56] <%Undenizen> i could sure go for a can of MONSTER ENERGY DRINK right about now!
[2:18:56] <$StrawberryPantsu> But Pat! WE NEED DYNAMIC HORSE TESTICLE TECHNOLOGY! WE NEED IT IN THE GAME!
[2:18:58] <JeoDood> team fortress ?

[2:19:12] <chofi0007> this game is reallyy cool
[2:19:20] <Manwad> in the far flung future, the only currency is energy drinks
[2:19:31] <+TyphonTwister> The orbs are from classic God of War, actually
[2:19:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> This is the first video game that actually makes me really mad that I can't get a PS5.
[2:19:39] <+Javaa01> @SaiyanShoto Orbs are probably Jak & Daxter
[2:19:44] <+allups> yes

[2:32:39] <+Rafraud> GLITCH POGGERS
[2:32:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> THATS WHY HE PLAYS TANKS
[2:32:43] <%JoshManVGH> Oh man Glitch is delightful.
[2:32:43] <%ape_hawk> thats because dodging is a temporary buff
[2:32:45] <%CalderGaming> just like always
[2:32:46] <Daxalog> @PatStaresAt Try to use low max ammo strong stuff on lesser enemies every now and then for them to get XP.
[2:32:47] <Psyramics> why dodge when health will just fly up your ass
[2:32:49] <xeros720> don't worry, he's a dark knight
[2:32:50] <+morningmoondude> Remember the dash is ALL invisibility frames
[2:32:51] <%Shubreaker> that warped you too an entirely new full planet btw

[2:32:56] <chofi0007> POGGERS
[2:32:56] <+morningmoondude> GLITCH IS WAIFU
[2:32:57] <stantheman_97> dodging is for people who want to be good
[2:32:57] <+fugatlas> Gene's review said glitch was like his favorite part of the game
[2:33:00] <%CalderGaming> HE HATES IT

[2:39:00] <%SaiyanShoto> Paige definitely needs to see Mort
[2:39:01] <%AncelDeLambert> fuck redoing everything you've done and investing in a seperate loadout
[2:39:02] <Silly_Duckling> Her and Ratchet have the same tastes
[2:39:02] <+johnnychopsocky> Space Magic and Mass Effect Fields
[2:39:03] <+brightman42> ms. zircon thinks they're the same lombax
[2:39:04] <ShadeTheNovice> dont think about it
[2:39:04] <romc215> Well, she is the alternate reality Ratchet so... science?
[2:39:06] <+ChaosEmralds> you can change her hammer colors too
[2:39:07] <xhodocto385> the hammer LUL i love it but why use melee weapons in the far future?, ranged weapons are all the rage today
[2:39:08] <%tactician0> @tactician0 no further comment
[2:39:08] <SaltyAzteca> LOMBAX SYNERGY
[2:39:09] <%athuramn> and she has story float instead of shoe float
[2:39:11] <ElMurpho> Hello there
[2:39:12] <Dunmarkh> she has the alternate universe copies of your weapons
[2:39:15] <Dunmarkh> like lucina
[2:39:18] <%Wallabri> this music is so... Jak and Daxtery
[2:39:18] <%AncelDeLambert> separate loadouts that are plot forced suck
[2:39:22] <%AzureGale> Rivet is Thor
[2:39:23] <%Ravioli_Ronin> Flow of time in Lombax is convoluted
[2:39:24] <%CommanderSqueaks> Cause she has a hammer.
[2:39:26] <+Rafraud> They mention how its weird they share things
[2:39:27] <ScottyScotch> Everything carries over
[2:39:29] <StarMechV> THERES ENERGY DRINKS INSIDE THESE PLANTS
[2:39:29] <lambishly> it's a hammer
[2:39:32] <xhodocto385> alternate ratchet, same weapon types obviously
[2:39:36] <%JoshManVGH> Lombax Zapping System!
[2:39:36] <Giztech> time travel........?

[2:39:44] <%AncelDeLambert> well... she got them from the resistance so CHECKS OUT
[2:39:45] <%CommanderSqueaks> I wonder what Fungi has to say about this planet.
[2:39:48] <+NickHatesSnow> she's a resistance member
[2:39:48] <Pookiedaexzile> Many people have them
[2:39:51] <+johnnychopsocky> Zapping System!

[2:39:59] <susukouhai> OMG it totally is
[2:40:03] <%tactician0> @it was behind you
[2:40:08] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is this the zapping system?
[2:40:08] <auraofdawn> the phantom move checks out bc she probly knows him
[2:40:10] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> does fungi become funGURL
[2:40:11] <Louie_Salmon> @joshmanvgh It's a scenario system, you DON'T KNOOOOWWWWW
[2:40:13] <+Romuken> to be honest, there are games where you switch between characters with different abilities.  This way, you can get all the weapons upgraded and not have to switch between mechanics?  @PatStaresAt
[2:40:14] <BeezusHrist> I DON'T WANT TO PLAY AS AN ICKY GIRL!!!! Some conservative mouthbreather LUL
[2:40:19] <lambishly> who put energy drinks in those pumpkins
[2:40:22] <%DorianCreed> @PatStaresAt There any alt skins for her hammer?
[2:40:23] <juanrock89> You can use photo mode to look at how crazy detailed everything is
[2:40:24] <Pookiedaexzile> Techically she had all this stuff first
[2:40:26] <+johnnychopsocky> Can't believe the vegetation contains energy drinks
[2:40:27] <$RealThiele> ok thats a bit much
[2:40:30] <stormhawk9891> @PatStaresAt So is this the Zapping system
[2:40:33] <%JoshManVGH> @top_lane_duelist Actually at level 5!
[2:40:34] <%Pandybun> Hey you got more health
[2:40:36] <%CommanderSqueaks> I can't believe this video game uses the zapping system.
[2:40:39] <%Varlinator> oh ma gurrrrd I can't believe foliage doesn't move :P

[2:42:41] <+allups> why was that cooler then starwars
[2:42:45] <+Top_Lane_Duelist> speetles
[2:42:46] <xhodocto385> convergent evolution says there shouldnt be dinos on other worlds Kappa
[2:42:47] <%AzureGale> It's p good
[2:42:47] <romc215> She is the queen of voice acting
[2:42:49] <%Nekros4442> Voice actors do dat
[2:42:54] <+cunningchaff> i wouldn't recognize her as jennifer hale
[2:42:57] <fluffy_sauce> it took me awhile to notice that it was her voice
[2:43:01] <+morningmoondude> i really didn't notice who she was until someone pointed it out here, and i beat the whole game
[2:43:06] <StaticEntry> i mean tidus still sounds the same too
[2:43:07] <a_mad_dragon_> it's probably pitch-shifted
[2:43:08] <+D00msDayDan> all i can hear is femshep trying to young it up
[2:43:09] <Daxalog> Was she Torque in Chimera Squad?
[2:43:09] <%JoshManVGH> See!
[2:43:11] <AthenaAegis> That's why Jen Hale is TOP TIER VA
[2:43:11] <Weeabooninja> Try to young up your voice, Pat
[2:43:15] <%JoshManVGH> That's why!
[2:43:15] <dan_g_v> she should be a V-Tuber
[2:43:16] <+fugatlas> and now we have an explanation
[2:43:18] <+Romuken> THERE'S THE EXPLANATION I love it for real
[2:43:20] <%CommanderSqueaks> CANON REASON
[2:43:21] <%shootbang_exe> does mrs. zurkon think all lombaxes know each other
[2:43:22] <+Rafraud> Seeeeee!
[2:43:24] <StarMechV> BEST TURRET TIME
[2:43:24] <Pookiedaexzile> You mean like every Little boy voice on tv for the last 100 years
[2:43:25] <dashwallkick> I think she's pitch shifted, they do the same thing to Dan Castlanetta when he does Homer Simpson too
[2:43:27] <+johnnychopsocky> Zapping Zurkon System
[2:43:31] <%AzureGale> THE TRAP
[2:43:32] <%JoshManVGH> Mrs Zerkon made a clerical error!
[2:43:33] <Yakobro> IL MHEG
[2:43:35] <xhodocto385> mutual friend LULW
[2:43:35] <StaticEntry> and Richard Horvitz is still zimming it up
[2:43:37] <Dunmarkh> you get the same weapons because of racial profiling
[2:43:38] <Virokwet> not a bad explination
[2:43:39] <neekocheeko> i love the sprinkler
[2:43:40] <+allups> o that and funji would be cool
[2:43:41] <%Shubreaker> gegegegege
[2:43:41] <MechanizedGentleman> oh good, body horror
[2:43:42] <+paladinstarbuster> but this means she knows rachet is real
[2:43:42] <dan_g_v> is this thing the Anna of this series?
[2:43:43] <Yakobro> SNAE LING
[2:43:43] <%miguelrod777> damn
[2:43:45] <AmuserName> Big Destroy all Humans vibes.
[2:43:48] <fojidoj> Sprinkler is real good
[2:43:49] <Soszynic> Pretty sure Jen Hale is in her 50's
[2:43:50] <%CalderGaming> oh i love Annihilation
[2:43:50] <%Undenizen> that's a little fucked up
[2:43:52] <T_Sasquatch> thats not horrific at all
[2:43:52] <juanrock89> that weapon is busted
[2:43:53] <SaltyAzteca> Thats a special kind of horror
[2:43:54] <StarMechV> IT WORKS WITH BOSSES
[2:43:54] <%tactician0> thats fucked up
[2:43:57] <%ape_hawk> shes been doing voice work for like 33 years, damn
[2:43:58] <+morningmoondude> STRONKER FUNGI
[2:43:59] <%CommanderSqueaks> @StaticEntry Richard Horvitz just sounds like that. LUL
[2:44:00] <Broken_Sonex> "WHO THE FUCK WAS THAT?"
[2:44:01] <romc215> What is interesting is the demo shows Ratchet and yet Clank or Rivet react to it
[2:44:03] <xhodocto385> now she knows of ratchet's existence
[2:44:04] <+Romuken> 1 short i think
[2:44:09] <%Pandybun> Jennifer Hale is 56
[2:44:11] <ergulor> just enough
[2:44:11] <+Romuken> no you got it
[2:44:14] <juanrock89> It works with everything included bosses
[2:44:19] <%Shubreaker> all in on fungi
[2:44:20] <%JoshManVGH> Topiary Sprinkler is one of the best CC attacks in any game.
[2:44:22] <%AzureGale> NOICE
[2:44:24] <Hydrapissed> monkaS
[2:44:24] <+fugatlas> you can frame trap the final boss of the game with the topiary sprinkeler, it feels REAL good
[2:44:24] <%Undenizen> yeah that invader zim guy is getting a LOT of work lately, huh?
[2:44:27] <+SolidusRex> Anyone ever seen Creepshow? Because that weapon
[2:44:27] <Pookiedaexzile> Over under on Rachet smashing
[2:44:29] <fluffy_sauce> @Daxalog Torque was voiced by the same person that did Jessie's voice in FF7 remake
[2:44:31] <akitanito> what is this minesweeper upgrade menu
[2:44:32] <ScreamLord> Richard Horvitz always gets the nerd alien roles
[2:44:33] <+morningmoondude> MR. STRONKGI
[2:44:34] <+johnnychopsocky> Nailed it
[2:44:38] <$RealThiele> mold powers

[2:47:35] <satans_finest_millennial> @abelincoln_catpuncher sounds like your roomate saved it from your haymakers
[2:47:38] <dan_g_v> @YakumoYomi that's how you communicate with the orb. You make contact
[2:47:39] <%AzureGale> Level up ALL the guns
[2:47:59] <KosOrSomeSayKosm_> yeah blast those frogs into the stratosphere
[2:48:04] <BeezusHrist> @T_Sasquatch those people who let their cats roam probably have Toxoplasma gondii
[2:48:05] <xhodocto385> KKona its future gun time
[2:48:07] <s1rcuit> yeah, after a certain lvl (usually around 5) the weapon changes noticeably @PatStaresAt
[2:48:13] <dan_g_v> murder all the animals
[2:48:16] <+JustToWatch> Yes
[2:48:17] <romc215> You're crazy

[2:48:49] <Profmcstevie> They're frogs, if it's like old R&C enemy EXP value is a thing
[2:48:49] <feralspidey> You are crazy, and Ratchet/Clank games never really give much exp
[2:48:50] <dan_g_v> Do you have hard numbers, or just visual refferences?
[2:48:51] <Slimeking_Mike> Those are just crummy little mooks you just fought

[3:01:28] <%Garthunox> like 30 minutes
[3:01:31] <%GalacticaPhanto> Have you tried dodging Brochacho?

[3:02:37] <%Lion_kun> Who loves Fargo?
[3:02:37] <%AzureGale> Are they all named Mort
[3:02:44] <+BoomerTiro> It worked for Nero
[3:02:45] <Louie_Salmon> Robot arms are always good
[3:02:47] <+fugatlas> Important plot bit: Clank is the son of this universes actual time god, and because of that has experience doing some existential soul/metaphysical bullshit
[3:02:48] <+Dives__> Everyone needs a robo arm
[3:02:49] <%JoshManVGH> They are ALL named Mort!
[3:02:52] <Louie_Salmon> Strict upgrade from arm

[3:02:59] <TioXyco> did you notice Link has a robot arm in BotW 2?
[3:02:59] <+TyphonTwister> And her not robot arm is JACKED
[3:03:03] <+Rosy_Joan> @patstaresat her arms are also more jacked than Ratchets
[3:03:04] <+tigerfang86> GRUNTHOR
[3:03:05] <+pectusumbra> Suddenly monster hunter
[3:03:08] <%GarbageNirvana> All she needs is a little hat
[3:03:12] <Broken_Sonex> She's basically Furry Fem Nero
[3:03:15] <+Buzzkill983> I would totally have robot limbs if they are like Deus Ex style
[3:03:20] <MechanizedGentleman> whooo I love monster hunter
[3:03:22] <%Lion_kun> Rivet is the best female character in a game I've seen in a while.
[3:03:22] <%chance_h> Walked right into chaos
[3:03:22] <mattdaddyd101> DontCha Know

[3:03:48] <+GingerStrawhat> Hey I just got in, Hows the game going Pat?
[3:03:58] <+BoomerTiro> Grunthor looks like what mandalorians have to kill for more honor points
[3:04:11] <$RealThiele> Omega Grunthor
[3:04:15] <xhodocto385> Capcom is going to sue this Kappa
[3:04:20] <%Ranryu692> that makes sense, Fungi seems OP
[3:04:27] <%AzureGale> VICTORY ACHIEVED
[3:04:28] <xhodocto385> Grunthor is just Space Deviljho
[3:04:28] <%The_Protagonist> carve it
[3:04:34] <Broken_Sonex> We keep Grunthor-ing to find that Grunthor
[3:04:34] <+zuzuxiv> now get its carves
[3:04:39] <+brightman42> I think an upgrade is more fungi

[3:06:53] <$SGrim> "Gary," said Gary in the Vault of Gary.

[3:07:27] <+johnnychopsocky> it is strong
[3:07:28] <Slimeking_Mike> NAUOOO
[3:07:29] <s1rcuit> it looks like the suck cannon
[3:07:30] <HaroldDonchee> that sounds like the dude from hazbin
[3:07:30] <tengel66> angry beaver voice lol
[3:07:31] <MechanizedGentleman> Pat you need more money!
[3:07:32] <StarMechV> Buy the Sprinkler it's super good
[3:07:36] <Broken_Sonex> "WHO THE FUCK IS THAT GUY?"
[3:07:36] <ScottyScotch> Ricochet is the worst gun
[3:07:37] <%Undenizen> can't build a resistance without capitalism!
[3:07:41] <+pectusumbra> and there's another one they are hinting at
[3:07:41] <+johnnychopsocky> it's a DO COMBO weapon
[3:07:44] <%Dfreddy8> GET MONEY
[3:07:44] <BappoTheMighty> Are you enjoying the game so far Pat?
[3:07:49] <+rean_v> the sprinkler is broken
[3:07:51] <+allups> ight we sleepy gn pat
[3:07:52] <+TyphonTwister> Ricochet is the best gun
[3:08:00] <Manderfuzz> LOUD PEE

[3:08:02] <MechanizedGentleman> Pat pees outside?
[3:08:02] <+Dives__> Pee outside like the dog
[3:08:02] <Profmcstevie> It might just need chunky amounts of exp
[3:08:05] <%Pandybun> Okay!
[3:08:06] <Case_Ah_Dia> treat yourself to pee
[3:08:06] <%Dfreddy8> YOU JUST PEED
[3:08:06] <SaltyAzteca> Piss break for errybody!
[3:08:08] <$RealThiele> robotic blackface

[3:08:10] <+brightman42> pat gonna pee outside
[3:08:10] <%JusTTheGuyYouNeed> Dont pee on the street its ilegal
[3:08:11] <%ansterdamn> pee time
[3:08:12] <%Undenizen> go pee with your dog.
[3:08:16] <%Undenizen> it's more efficient
[3:08:22] <%tactician0> it true
[3:08:24] <kago_dev> Pat's pee time ranges from 2 seconds to one LOTR film
[3:08:27] <susukouhai> time to grind Kappa
[3:08:29] <%Pandybun> Break time
[3:08:29] <Broken_Sonex> Lotta pee in those balls gotta get it out
[3:08:32] <+johnnychopsocky> Ricochet is a Boss Bludgeoner
[3:08:33] <sendart> just dont accidently pee on the dog
[3:08:38] <%Undenizen> @JusTTheGuyYouNeed oh sure for the DOG its legal but me????
[3:08:42] <$RealThiele> 5 to pee, 5 to cheat
[3:08:45] <%Monkeyweed21> piss is the ultimate litter, even when they wash it off the smell lingers
[3:08:46] <vVAstrAVv> does this weapon menus music sound like the no mans sky theme to anyone else
[3:08:48] <%traximus_s> dose Zim and Billy from grim adventures share the same VA?
[3:09:01] <+Edbotnik> yes
[3:09:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Undenizen thats because a dog is cute and you are not
[3:09:14] <%Undenizen> yeah that guy has been in a ton of shit lately.
[3:09:23] <%Undenizen> SHUT UP. I'm cute. >:[
[3:09:42] <%doc_ock_rokc> But are you DOG CUTE
[3:09:42] <%traximus_s> cool
[3:09:44] <+johnnychopsocky> oh that's why Elmo was messing with the audio board: working on his DJ skills
[3:09:53] <+johnnychopsocky> for the interstitial
[3:09:54] <%chance_h> I’m gonna be honest here guys… there isn’t enough r34 of this game and that makes me sad
[3:09:59] <+jetrouverai> the guy who did the music for this game did the music for thor ragnarok i think
[3:10:13] <Broken_Sonex> @chance_h Give it time.
[3:10:20] <%Undenizen> @doc_ock_rokc this is an unreasonably high bar and i am being oppressed by society.
[3:10:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> @chance_h you are not looking hard enough
[3:10:31] <BigFingerRo> @chance_h give it some time, the characters are too cute not to be porno'd
[3:10:38] <kago_dev> Why is Paige stylized in this, but Pat is photorealistic
[3:10:39] <placeholder03> @chance_h just play some re8 in the meantime
[3:10:45] <AoG_JarlRaven> Is Ratchet edgey again in this game?
[3:10:53] <%CommanderSqueaks> No
[3:10:55] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's a nice boy
[3:11:02] <%Undenizen> what do you MEAN some time? there was porn roughtly 2 minutes after the reveal trailer
[3:11:02] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Oh neat. I loved the PS2 Ratched & Clank games. Never tried the PS3 and beyond ones though
[3:11:04] <%Alaster101> Alaster101 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 20 months! love you little goblin man, your the highlight of me fighting bronchitis this  week, keep up the good work
[3:11:17] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Undenizen if you want pee on street privliages you gotta have big brown eyes, jowels and  hair all over yourself
[3:11:17] <AoG_JarlRaven> Dang it boy scout Ratchet is ResidentSleeper to me
[3:11:31] <AdjathaTheDrinker> The All-Arena one was... not so great.
[3:11:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> Every character is Snarky now, it's nice to have a boy scout once in a while, as a treat.
[3:11:42] <%Undenizen> @doc_ock_rokc you're describing my grandpa
[3:11:44] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Which is weird, because the arena was a fun part of all the other games.
[3:12:01] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Kind of a 'too much of a good thing' issue. You want some, but not all.
[3:12:26] <%DashXero> When everyone is snark, everyone's annoying.
[3:12:28] <HaroldDonchee> deadlocked? i liked it but yeah that's true
[3:12:30] <AdjathaTheDrinker> I wonder what the RYNO for this game will be like.
[3:12:32] <deviljhojho_> i mean ratchet did have like 7 games to chill the fuck out
[3:12:39] <%DashXero> You need a straight-man.
[3:12:44] <deviljhojho_> @AdjathaTheDrinker its legit incredible
[3:12:46] <deviljhojho_> no spoilers tho
[3:12:51] <AdjathaTheDrinker> I appreciate that they varied up the ultimate gun from one game to the next.
[3:12:52] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DashXero exactlY!
[3:12:58] <%Undenizen> I read a book called Snow Crash once, and i swear EVERY character in it was "cyberpunk asshole". it got real boring real fast.
[3:13:07] <%CommanderSqueaks> I like that Rachet isn't just not mean, he's actively nice to pretty much everyone who isn't actively malicious.
[3:13:20] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Nice! Always good to have a satisfying ultimate. There was one that was not so great. I forget which game, but it was just a ton of micro missiles.
[3:13:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Clank too. They're cinnamon rolls.
[3:13:30] <deviljhojho_> he is even nice to that one crazy bot
[3:13:42] <%AzureGale> A Crack In Time had the best RYNO
[3:13:55] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Aw, I think that was the PS3 one
[3:13:58] <%AzureGale> That one played the 1812 Overture when you fired it
[3:13:59] <%doc_ock_rokc> This is why i can't enjoy most media 90% of it is the exact same buffy the vampire slayer esk character
[3:14:18] <+jetrouverai> the all 4 one ryno was very neat
[3:14:29] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Never played it. I'd heard the PS3 was a pretty garbage system so I never picked it up. The FF games for that gen were also trash and I used to buy my PS systems for pretty much just FF alone.
[3:14:36] <%AnthroMetal> AnthroMetal subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 22 months, currently on a 22 month streak! 
[3:14:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> @doc_ock_rokc You mean acting like they're written by Joss Whedon?
[3:14:45] <$RealThiele> verbal dunking can get old yea. especially when you see people say slammed or destroyed all the time
[3:14:54] <%DashXero> It's like writers nowadays don't know how to make straight-men interesting.
[3:15:06] <%doc_ock_rokc> @CommanderSqueaks yeah Whedon clone writers are the worst
[3:15:09] <%Undenizen> @doc_ock_rokc when the future historians look back on the early 21st century, they're going to think we worship cynicism. and they wouldn't be wrong.
[3:15:12] <+wmeldrum> dog emptying is hard
[3:15:22] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Gotta have an Abbot to your Costello
[3:15:24] <theredfox930000> this is the best part of the stream
[3:15:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> I also like that Ratchet and Clank aren't like Straight Man and Whacky Guy. They're both just genuinely nice and openly caring to each other. It's sweet.
[3:15:40] <%DashXero> Exactly, AdjathaTheDrinker .
[3:15:51] <%doc_ock_rokc> @DashXero They also don't know how to Pass the role around. Ghostbusters had each character play the straightman to eachother
[3:16:01] <%sandrews> I do like Nathan Drake snark. But like his seemed like relief on the situations he was in.
[3:16:11] <%GalacticaPhanto> when you're high like me this is the vibing part until the Pat part
[3:16:17] <%Undenizen> Don't act like Ratchet isn't on a quest to rescue his boyfriend.
[3:16:18] <Broken_Sonex> @doc_ock_rokc THIS^
[3:16:25] <%ghostydash> i love the elmo animation
[3:16:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> YES
[3:16:31] <%DashXero> @doc_ock_rokc Bullseye.
[3:16:43] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Anybody here see the R&C movie? It really felt like they just took the cut scenes out of a game and passed it off as a movie. Had so many Fade To Black bits, where I'm like, and that's where the player gets control."
[3:16:57] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did he poop in that mean old man's yard?
[3:16:59] <theredfox930000> no
[3:17:00] <stantheman_97> yeah sure
[3:17:01] <Dunmarkh> ye
[3:17:01] <no123450n> no

[3:17:09] <%jetrouverai> I will give you a topiary sprinkler for 4,000 mini colas
[3:17:10] <%DashXero> Pat, we're miles away.
[3:17:14] <stantheman_97> PAT I WANT ONE
[3:17:16] <%AzureGale> Let me give you my address pat. jk
[3:17:19] <%chance_h> Sure
[3:17:23] <+froggycleric> mini cola looks like a normal can, the tiny hands strikes again
[3:17:24] <Oxybe> Send it through the interwebs @patstaresat
[3:17:25] <%Undenizen> mini colas are just the right size to be really unsatisfying.
[3:17:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> Did Gief poop in that mean old' man's yard?
[3:17:31] <Dunmarkh> I'll  fucking walk
[3:17:32] <kago_dev> Peddle your miniature sodas elsewhere
[3:17:39] <no123450n> mini cola is something mini people drink
[3:17:40] <Slimeking_Mike> I dont want a mini cola but thank you for ofering.
[3:17:45] <AdjathaTheDrinker> In the land of the Wee, Mini-Colas are like 2L bottles.
[3:17:46] <Dunmarkh> pour it on your keyboard
[3:17:46] <%Deft_Thought> monkaS
[3:17:46] <%AzureGale> Throw it at the camera and we'll catch it
[3:17:47] <%walternatorz> .......
[3:17:48] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Pat wins again!
[3:17:49] <Ner234> Ewww
[3:17:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Next bit

[3:19:26] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Much crap to be crapped
[3:19:28] <%Monkeyweed21> no lol
[3:19:35] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Hell yeah PS2 R&C
[3:19:46] <%AzureGale> But the PS3 games are good
[3:19:48] <Warbot40> Only the Reboot is trash
[3:19:48] <kago_dev> Pat is SMART (not lazy)
[3:19:52] <%Monkeyweed21> the PS3 games were great @PatStaresAt
[3:19:59] <+SolidusRex> The PS3 games are good
[3:19:59] <s1rcuit> the last two were garbage
[3:19:59] <Manwad> future was great
[3:20:00] <+brightman42> they weren't trash just not as good
[3:20:00] <xhodocto385> i loved a crack in time
[3:20:05] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Slim Cognito for best Video Game Character 2021
[3:20:07] <fojidoj> PS3 games are great
[3:20:08] <Dova573> I think he means the games after the future trrilogy
[3:20:10] <Broken_Sonex> PS3 game were good just not great
[3:20:20] <HaroldDonchee> what even happened to ratchet? I missed the start of the stream
[3:20:31] <%jetrouverai> honestly this game makes me trust insomniac handling dual protagonists for Spider-Man 2
[3:20:33] <+SolidusRex> The PS4 game is the bad one
[3:20:35] <%The_Protagonist> is that Jennifer Hale?
[3:20:36] <%Bane_Kaikyo> The only other Ratchet and Clank game I played was Crack in Time and that one was pretty dope
[3:20:37] <%DashXero> Real nice atmospherics.
[3:20:39] <%Shubreaker> foil-age
[3:20:46] <%chance_h> Enjoyment > realism complaints
[3:20:50] <%CommanderSqueaks> Non-reactive foliage 0/10
[3:20:59] <%Ranryu692> Youtube compression is going to murder this game
[3:21:10] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Oh yeah, hammer instead of wrench
[3:21:13] <%ansterdamn> why does ratchet not have a ratchet?
[3:21:15] <no123450n> dad of clank
[3:21:21] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Weird. There's so many wrench-ables in the other games.
[3:21:26] <%SveriSageAdvice> actually Twitch is being fairly nice to it
[3:21:27] <%AzureGale> LEG DAY
[3:21:29] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Just a lot of pounding in this one, I guess
[3:21:29] <+brightman42> it looks pretty good still
[3:21:30] <Broken_Sonex> Women DO love their hammers
[3:21:31] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Giggity
[3:21:31] <%Dfreddy8> Wish that AXE came back though.
[3:21:37] <%chance_h> @ranryu692 yeah I noticed issues earlier
[3:21:38] <+ImmaterialHero> Yeah no, this game looks SO much better in person than on any stream
[3:21:39] <%MidnightBurst12> It's not too bad
[3:21:46] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, you're dead.
[3:21:52] <%JoshManVGH> The PS4 games biggest problem is that it was SUPER obvious that all the cutscenes where snips from the movie. And some really awkwardly cut.
[3:21:53] <StarMechV> PAT YOU MISSED HITTING A SITTING CAR
[3:21:59] <gslayer14> THEY'RE WIGGIN OUT
[3:22:01] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Is this game for PS4 and PS5, or PS5 only?
[3:22:11] <Dova573> Im forever salty at that one hollywood video that I rented Up your arsenal for it to be fucking scratched
[3:22:17] <%Taisuru> Melee them
[3:22:19] <+brightman42> ps5 only
[3:22:20] <%tactician0> they do
[3:22:24] <%bevyrage> no damage by default
[3:22:25] <%JoshManVGH> PS5 only @adjathathedrinker
[3:22:34] <s1rcuit> be pointless to use it if they didn't
[3:22:34] <+frenchyred0> Only for the ps5

[3:23:07] <s1rcuit> @DashXero because they are? clearly they're not very smart

[3:44:12] <ScottyScotch> You’re literally about to in 3 seconds
[3:44:14] <%RonaldMcDownload> Rivet fanart has been flowing since the game annoucement
[3:44:15] <Pookiedaexzile> Oh no
[3:44:21] <+black_pariah> @mechslayer71 that started the day of the first trailer
[3:44:25] <%chance_h> Dog goes bork
[3:44:28] <s1rcuit> @EsotericOdyssey it's certainly possible
[3:44:31] <%Pandybun> Poor Zangief
[3:44:40] <AdjathaTheDrinker> I feel like Rivet r34 got overshadowed by Vampire Mommy
[3:44:42] <SaltyAzteca> let me in, LET ME IIIIIN
[3:44:44] <+sixcubit> @EsotericOdyssey the nefarii are visually indistinguishable, so probably not?
[3:44:44] <UnImprest> @EsotericOdyssey looks like the real male version to me
[3:44:47] <BigFingerRo> Man, this robot is like two minutes away from going "I DUNNO CAPPN, I DUNNO BOUT THE PACIFICS HE'E"
[3:44:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> @AdjathaTheDrinker You'd be wrong.
[3:45:12] <+mechslayer71> @bigfingerro naw, this is white southern not black
[3:45:24] <%AzureGale> Which upgrade do you want
[3:45:29] <%GarbageNirvana> For a split second I thought that was Paige doing a voice
[3:45:31] <AdjathaTheDrinker> So many r34 characters coming out these days. The fields are fertile.
[3:45:31] <+ChaosEmralds> yes
[3:45:32] <%AzureGale> Yes
[3:45:33] <bharcoot> Yeah
[3:45:33] <%ssjklyco> yes

[3:45:53] <+SolidusRex> No need to respec
[3:45:53] <%cvp5127> yes and no
[3:46:02] <%Varlinator> @PatStaresAt Ms Zurkon is voiced by Courtney Taylor (aka Jack)
[3:46:12] <Silly_Duckling> Can you do anything with the excess or do they just accumulate after you're maxed?
[3:46:13] <%cvp5127> the game isnt hard to warrant a respec
[3:46:17] <AdjathaTheDrinker> New Game+ on these games was always great. Go back through things with a complete arsenal. So gratifying
[3:46:22] <%JoshManVGH> 5
[3:46:26] <j2_daboy> how's the game sor far?
[3:46:28] <%Faustgesicht> Mass effect Jack?
[3:46:31] <+Cobaltor_252> man this game feels like it's heads and shoulders above the past ones
[3:46:37] <+GingerStrawhat> Level 5 gives them a new look
[3:46:42] <%JoshManVGH> Level five weapons get brand new properties
[3:46:46] <deviljhojho_> ASCENDED
[3:46:54] <s1rcuit> oh yeah, he's a Zoni
[3:46:54] <%AzureGale> Clank is robot ghost
[3:46:54] <Psyramics> Assuming control
[3:46:55] <gslayer14> clank sequence?
[3:46:57] <gslayer14> sure
[3:47:04] <%Undenizen> he's in the afterlife.
[3:47:04] <%Pandybun> I like it how Clank and Rivet are both missing their right arm
[3:47:05] <mattdaddyd101> robo ghosts
[3:47:09] <%Shubreaker> whoa a handsome dude
[3:47:09] <deviljhojho_> dunno
[3:47:09] <$StrawberryPantsu> OH NO!  THE FURRY GIRL IS TOO CUTE! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP!

[3:47:15] <%cvp5127> clank has a soul
[3:47:17] <Broken_Sonex> Oh yeah, I forgot his like a Zoni
[3:47:17] <+TopTieramisu> is this where you can find space jam 2?
[3:47:21] <%ansterdamn> the matrix~
[3:47:21] <HaroldDonchee> do you think those guys call the coffee place Tim Mortans
[3:47:22] <%chance_h> Phantom limb syndrome
[3:47:24] <TioXyco> LCL?
[3:47:27] <+Cobaltor_252> @PatStaresAt no Clank may or may not have some connection to the fabric of time and space
[3:47:30] <%Varlinator> Robot Purgatory
[3:47:32] <deviljhojho_> these puzzles are actully real easy
[3:47:35] <$StrawberryPantsu> M A K E   I T STOP

[3:47:49] <Dunmarkh> are we in hell?
[3:47:50] <%Undenizen> you know, everyone's talking about Rivet but I'm seeing a LOT of furry bait going on.
[3:47:53] <%Jeemukun> hi gary
[3:47:54] <%The_Protagonist> joke kinda gets lost when it says "Gary" on the screen the whole time
[3:47:55] <s1rcuit> THE PLUMBER
[3:48:00] <deviljhojho_> its actually really unclear
[3:48:02] <$StrawberryPantsu> Lore
[3:48:05] <$StrawberryPantsu> Now shut up
[3:48:07] <%tactician0> from a clank in time
[3:48:10] <ammobasket> MIGHT?!?!?
[3:48:11] <Psyramics> dont worry about it you skipped like 4 games
[3:48:12] <Broken_Sonex> THE PLUMMER?!
[3:48:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> @s1rcuit Really? Let him discover it himself. Shut up
[3:48:16] <+CptnCampy61> I like Gary
[3:48:19] <%RonaldMcDownload> Now Gary definitely has a cloaca
[3:48:19] <+GingerStrawhat> He says who his father is in a little bit
[3:48:20] <ergulor> so we pick pat
[3:48:20] <%Tearonex> from the previous games

[3:48:32] <%Ranryu692> @HaroldDonchee LUL
[3:48:37] <%sjay662> it's lemmings
[3:48:47] <%AzureGale> We Lemmings now
[3:48:50] <Srthunda> this game really loves that after image tech
[3:48:57] <%QueequegTheater> Wow Clank is an egomaniac
[3:49:03] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Oh shit, you're right
[3:49:03] <%chance_h> Fallow the suicidal robats
[3:49:05] <jorniev> WOOOOOW
[3:49:08] <%The_Protagonist> so... Lemmings
[3:49:15] <%Bane_Kaikyo> Clank is cannonically supposed to run and maintain the massive clock that controls all of time that in the center of the universe (give or take a few feet)
[3:49:16] <DrStinkers> lemmings
[3:49:16] <KahnWick> this looks better than the ACIT Clank puzzles tbh
[3:49:17] <%Undenizen> all these versions of you are constantly committing suicide.
[3:49:19] <jorniev> super meatboy
[3:49:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> Welcome to Lemmings
[3:49:23] <+CptnCampy61> Stupid game and it’s immersive seemless transitions
[3:49:23] <s1rcuit> @s1rcuit I haven't even touched this game and I could figure it out
[3:49:24] <rReizs> INTERDIMENSIONAL ENERGY DRINKS
[3:49:26] <Pookiedaexzile> Look at all this gameplay

[3:49:32] <%EsotericOdyssey> @Bane_Kaikyo wh
[3:49:33] <UnImprest> become as gods
[3:49:39] <%JoshManVGH> Those boxes of energy drinks were breaking reality
[3:49:42] <%EsotericOdyssey> if he's not doing it then whomst is
[3:49:54] <Tisaric> oh cool it's the gel part from Portal 2 with lemmings
[3:49:56] <Dunmarkh> DIE PROUD
[3:50:01] <%Pandybun> No. Lemmings were pushed off to their death from Disney
[3:50:02] <%walternatorz> lemmings with portal2
[3:50:03] <+black_pariah> i feel like these are going to turn into late game portal rooms real quick
[3:50:07] <%radregice> @EsotericOdyssey a different cartoon robot
[3:50:14] <%QueequegTheater> Expedite the mass suicide
[3:50:16] <%Dfreddy8> NARUTO RUN
[3:50:20] <+GingerStrawhat> Naruto Run Robot
[3:50:21] <AdjathaTheDrinker> There were Minion-bots in earlier games that had specialized jobs, but nothing quite so... suicidal as these ones
[3:50:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> They're sanic
[3:50:43] <+Romuken> look at them naruto run
[3:50:46] <%CalderGaming> now he gets it

[3:51:06] <%heartlesshealer> Lemmings is old enough for the [Kids] to not know
[3:51:08] <Pookiedaexzile> Now the first real one
[3:51:11] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Clank storms Area 51: the mini-game
[3:51:20] <%MisterRockett> Clank's games are typically some kind of twist on Lemmings.
[3:51:30] <%Varlinator> I feel bad for the people who made that last Abe's Odyssey game.
[3:51:32] <%Undenizen> did an inter-dimensional demi-god really need clank to solve this?
[3:51:41] <BigFingerRo> SMART
[3:51:48] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Gary's really lazy

[3:59:13] <%chance_h> Welcome to the thirst stream raiders
[3:59:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Wait they've been off since LAST stream!? Jesus.
[3:59:14] <AdjathaTheDrinker> The lack of side paths and re-exploration was one of the disappointing parts of R&C4:  Deadlocked, actually. Very linear.
[3:59:15] <%The_Protagonist> Dr. Beef

[4:00:10] <deviljhojho_> i get it
[4:00:11] <+Havictos> I would love to get this but I don't have the ability to afford a ps5 anytime soon
[4:00:13] <juanrock89> use the sprinkler
[4:00:15] <%ssjklyco> It's good at stopping bosses and enimies
[4:00:16] <%AzureGale> Too bad
[4:00:17] <+GingerStrawhat> Really like the music here, Reminds me of Simpsons Wave videos I watch
[4:00:17] <juanrock89> it's busted
[4:00:17] <Tisaric> there's always a couple of those weapons in these
[4:00:17] <%cvp5127> stops everything

[4:00:23] <%DakotaMacDoodle> Dont forget about pacing Poultry
[4:00:25] <%MrP33Ps> topiary sprinkler gets really good
[4:00:27] <StarMechV> ya aint using it right but its fine. IT's very good to keep bosses still
[4:00:28] <+GingerStrawhat> The Topiary is really really good when your surrouned
[4:00:28] <BigFingerRo> Now we must combine the Pasta Raid with the Beef raid, to create the ULTIMATE STREAM LIFEFORM, the stroganoff raid
[4:00:28] <%CommanderSqueaks> Remember Pat you can COME back
[4:00:30] <%TheHappyCynic> yeah uh when the hell are we all getting ps5s
[4:00:31] <%Monkeyweed21> just powerlevel the shitty weapons in the arena
[4:00:32] <Psyramics> probably more useful on higher difficulties when CCIng enemies could be useful
[4:00:34] <%TheHappyCynic> are they in stock yet
[4:00:40] <%OrangeMDT> But it stops all :(
[4:00:40] <shaybcakes> is it a sprinkler for topiaries or does it sprinkle topiaries
[4:00:43] <%ssjklyco> You come back later with more movement options
[4:00:46] <s1rcuit> how much is a ps5?
[4:00:46] <+GingerStrawhat> You can't get everything on the first run technically
[4:01:07] <%JoshManVGH> Its gets to a point where you can summon an army and freeze a boss in a shrub only to watch it's health melt.
[4:01:13] <+black_pariah> i look away from the stream for 10 minutes and the first thing i see when i look back is  "fast pork the lombussy" LUL
[4:01:13] <%Broand> You can ride those things on the acid too by the way
[4:01:20] <+Crimsonpajamas > I love that this game feels like a Saturday cartoon show.
[4:01:30] <%Pandybun> He's so depressed
[4:01:33] <%EsotericOdyssey> hes so tired
[4:01:37] <+GingerStrawhat> Mr. Fungi is so broken at level 5 holy shit
[4:01:47] <+wizard_of_diamonds> He wants to die AND WE WON'T LET HIM :<
[4:01:55] <dugumpfert> I forgot Ratchet has a canonical girlfriend

[4:02:58] <%AzureGale> LUL
[4:03:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @Broand WHY did you tell him that
[4:03:05] <+GingerStrawhat> These planets are bigger then you would think
[4:03:09] <Pookiedaexzile> It's almost like they want you to explore the level they handcrafted
[4:03:15] <%Broand> Because I am chaos
[4:03:17] <%CommanderSqueaks> Alright, well, this is the rest of the stream now.
[4:03:33] <%pokefan9956> as a guy who has never played a ratchet and clank game, would I be making a mistake by starting with this one?
[4:03:34] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt sometimes it is hard to tell if thats genuine praise or sarcasm
[4:03:36] <ammobasket> consider the humble snail
[4:03:40] <Oxybe> Question for char: are the snails the lombussy wagons?
[4:03:41] <dugumpfert> @Havictos Yeah Talwyn. This is supposed to be a direct sequel to 2013's Into the Nexus

[4:05:29] <Silly_Duckling> Nobody expects the second Grunthor
[4:05:33] <+vaultzombie> A sudden influx of GRUNTHORS should solve this
[4:05:38] <+wizard_of_diamonds> Damn this game is rad
[4:05:45] <+ChaosEmralds> you can throw more than one fungi btw
[4:05:47] <Pookiedaexzile> Keep shooting the dick part
[4:05:53] <%AzureGale> Ain't this the third Grunthor technically
[4:05:57] <s1rcuit> is that an ammo bar under the crosshair?
[4:06:09] <AdjathaTheDrinker> What's this? A nice picnic in the park? Nothing a few GRUNTHORS won't fix!
[4:06:10] <+GingerStrawhat> Wow he almost looked happy for a sec there

[4:08:02] <AdjathaTheDrinker> Question: Is Raritanium very easy to find and extremely common? I certainly hope so!
[4:08:04] <+cowkid222> it's funny watching the run cycle, I'm so used to just jet boosting all the time in R&C games

[4:38:39] <%DashXero> Paige, it's not about everyone liking your art. It's about projecting your vision into the world.
[4:38:41] <%Dfreddy8> Just don't show it to Plague

[4:39:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> Peach there's a different between that turkey being ugly and for it clearly wishing for the sweet release of death.

[4:44:02] <%DianaTheAscian> Does Geif run into walls often?
[4:44:05] <%CommanderSqueaks> The hand turkey did a debuff to Pat's sense of direction.
[4:44:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> He has NO HEAD
[4:44:18] <%Ranryu692> fat and headless
[4:44:22] <%Undenizen> Y'know, the more i learn about dolphins the more i think it might be SUPER immoral to keep them in any kind of captivity.
