[0:49:39] <+Emperor_Bad> @JGardner88 gameplay just started
[0:49:39] <%CubicPhantom> wait, there's no labrador in here!
[0:49:43] <%konekoryugamine> Reminds me of Black Meas
[0:49:46] <%konekoryugamine> Mesa,
[0:49:47] <MrDonTacos_> no power armor cuz it cost 2000 atoms
[0:49:47] <%Remery_> @AngriestPat Wait you said you hate pizza. Do you like Tacos and Burritos?
[0:49:47] <%LixFury> apatSkelmo
[0:49:48] <%konekoryugamine> sorry
[0:49:48] <NikWritesStuff> i'm sorry mam but your son has a sneak disability
[0:49:49] <+TastySammiches> damn look at all those oblivion plants
[0:49:49] <RetributionP> fuck that just wear the power armor because it's cool
[0:49:50] <dinkyrink> keely's at the very bottom
[0:49:51] <%snow_bush> This fault should be like a real one. Unopened and we don't see the contents.
[0:49:51] <%Raxus_Secundus> This place seems nice
[0:49:51] <+TheWallOfMeat> @Kahnicus you can hotkey armor?
[0:49:54] <CalderGaming> hewWO?
[0:49:58] <Valentinius_Anodyne> It's fine
[0:50:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @dekkitout it should be a little more stable since he's got all the mods and the GOG version
[0:50:04] <UPTONOGOOD18> Lonesome road riot armor is best
[0:50:05] <%lewdskeletor13> UH OH
[0:50:05] <Conky89> Places with lots of vegetation make me feel really relaxed, both in real life and in fiction
[0:50:08] <%Mirrorcatch> yo apparently you can make flies into fungus monsters by messing with their gut flora genetics
[0:50:08] <derap41> This just in Ginger afraid of plants
[0:50:09] <st_jimmy456> gonna get nothinged to death
[0:50:10] <%joylent_blue> hewwo? oWo
[0:50:12] <rockworm> oh god I hope we don't get NOTHINGed
[0:50:15] <%Kahnicus> @TheWallOfMeat yeah, i do it so i can get that faster run perk
[0:50:16] <%konekoryugamine> Some purple plants
[0:50:19] <%JGardner88> @Emperor_Bad But what about the Pre-gameplay shenanigans?!
[0:50:20] <Coystick> WHO'S HICCUPING?
[0:50:23] <%konekoryugamine> THE FUCK
[0:50:27] <%konekoryugamine> What was that?!
[0:50:27] <%Bailey__gaming> peach has hiccups
[0:50:28] <+Will_The_Soulless> Hey @AngriestPat , So I'm going to be getting the new Resident Evil 2 when it releases because of your streams. Would you recommend who to start with Claire or Leon? I've never played the game before and know literally nothing
[0:50:28] <derap41> Did I say 5 min I meant 2
[0:50:29] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Are you okay Paige?
[0:50:32] <C_S_N_G> You missed a terminal
[0:50:32] <%kiiiirsten> WHO HICCUPED THAT?
[0:50:33] <chza> @AngriestPat You should keep the train of old RPGs going after New Vegas while you're doing Remake. Perhaps Oblivion?
[0:50:34] <%lewdskeletor13> WHO HICCUPED?
[0:50:34] <Worldbrand> whose footprints are these?
[0:50:35] <+gearcannon> Man I hate this vault so much, with my fear of man-eating plants in all
[0:50:36] <st_jimmy456> i guess vaults kinda are just dungeons huh?
[0:50:37] <bryanlee94> are those Hicks or oinks
[0:50:40] <SaikaMercenary> That's the magic of Vault 22
[0:50:42] <ScreamingMeat> WHO'S CHOCKING!?
[0:50:44] <catwithsunglasses> i can't forget everything in this dungeon ever and that's probably a worse fate
[0:50:45] <+Bupkis7> That was pretty good
[0:50:46] <SaikaMercenary> getting lost AF
[0:50:49] <FearDasZombie> What a nerd Pat is, using a semi-modern rifle when he could be using an old ass western gun
[0:50:49] <Desertfishing> this vault layout sucks
[0:50:50] <%konekoryugamine> What, that you can use a map?
[0:50:51] <mr_ESB> Ahhh? ;)
[0:50:55] <%kiiiirsten> @gearcannon I'm fine, my fear is plant-eating men
[0:50:59] <Coystick> Elmmmmooooooo
[0:50:59] <%NWR_James> BIG RINGS
[0:51:00] <%konekoryugamine> Perfect timing
[0:51:02] <mr_slaide> HE WILL SCREM
[0:51:03] <zerocruz> Man this vault scared the shit out of me as a dumb kid
[0:51:03] <+TastySammiches> it's mister peepee
[0:51:06] <%lewdskeletor13> Are these the mantis men Cave Johnson was talking about?
[0:51:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> welcome to Vault 22, where if you're lost, you're in the right place
[0:51:08] <derap41> Stop freaking out over literal plants
[0:51:10] <%PaladinDupre> WHOS FIGHTING
[0:51:13] <calamarvelous> Elmo's Fucking Pissed
[0:51:14] <%joylent_blue> ED-E false alarms are the best........ PunOko
[0:51:17] <natebud> how can you get lost when you have an elevator that connects directly to the exit
[0:51:19] <%konekoryugamine> Is it weird if I thought the plant in the other room was a gnome?
[0:51:23] <%cureneckbeard> rhyme
[0:51:25] <mr_slaide> Elmo has had enough of your shit.
[0:51:27] <GohanEgret> he screm
[0:51:29] <derap41> MAKE WAY FOR ELMO
[0:51:30] <Coystick> i HEAR him
[0:51:30] <dekkitout> no, the gnome was pat
[0:51:33] <%lewdskeletor13> apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep apatBlep
[0:51:34] <mr_ESB> Babby?
[0:51:34] <grayjammer> nya ~~~~!
[0:51:35] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten so you don't like vegetarians either?
[0:51:35] <%konekoryugamine> hehehehehe
[0:51:37] <Valentinius_Anodyne> PE-P is doing a scream
[0:51:38] <+TheWallOfMeat> Why do they call Elmo peepee again?
[0:51:40] <xeros720> MROW
[0:51:41] <%Kahnicus> there's lots of shitty doors making it hard to get to the varying sections of the vault
[0:51:41] <Coystick> loud man
[0:51:41] <%cureneckbeard> Why does your robot have a ringtone
[0:51:43] <%lewdskeletor13> apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink apatWink
[0:51:44] <$tsundere____> show emlo bepis
[0:51:45] <%Quigsies> apatBlep
[0:51:45] <FearDasZombie> I still remember how clever I felt using the server room to take cover from the big vent blast
[0:51:49] <Coystick> big noise
[0:51:51] <%Bailey__gaming> he Scream
[0:51:51] <%konekoryugamine> HI ELMO
[0:51:54] <st_jimmy456> @TheWallOfMeat pat and paige
[0:51:57] <%lewdskeletor13> SHOW EMLO
[0:51:57] <BallinArbiter> He scream
[0:51:58] <%CubicPhantom> I don't understand why the plants got out the front of the facility but not more than like 40 feet
[0:51:58] <+TastySammiches> obsidian is better than bethesda at making RPGS, but they're a lot worse at making coherent interior spaces
[0:51:58] <%konekoryugamine> Anyone who hates Elmo can suck it
[0:52:00] <GyroBrando> emlo is best boy
[0:52:03] <%FrostMass22> @konekoryugamine It wasn't a gnelf and it wasn't a gnoblim, it was gnome and you've just been gnomedA
[0:52:03] <%Kahnicus> you can also get parts for the brotherhood here
[0:52:04] <%Magnion> Emlo is the reason we watch.
[0:52:10] <Coystick> ED-E vs Elmo who wins?
[0:52:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Elmo
[0:52:15] <dekkitout> its more of his hype/fight music
[0:52:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> elmo
[0:52:17] <%konekoryugamine> @FrostMass22 What's getting gnomed?
[0:52:20] <+TheWallOfMeat> @st_jimmy456 okay so it's just their normal crazy nonsensical bullshit, nothing special?

[0:52:39] <+Answer_Moose> Hand tossed is regular pizza
[0:52:42] <+TheWallOfMeat> Wait, she's still ordering the pizza?
[0:52:42] <Puppa_Warpig> Worst Vault in Vegas
[0:52:45] <derap41> Its like school lunch pizza
[0:52:46] <st_jimmy456> @TheWallOfMeat same as it ever was, yeah
[0:52:46] <catwithsunglasses> please don't go through this entire dungeon, i hate it
[0:52:47] <dinkyrink> just get thin crust
[0:52:48] <Bonk_Fever> Please stop ordering Domino's. You DO NOT want to eat that. Order real pizza PLEASE
[0:52:48] <+Answer_Moose> Pan pizza is a thicker crust
[0:52:50] <+TastySammiches> pan pizza is like halfway between deep dish and real pizza
[0:52:50] <+Promessa_EX> put a grip on that ar. actually idk if you can
[0:52:50] <zerocruz> Love this Vault
[0:52:51] <%lewdskeletor13> Pan Pizza is attracted to everything
[0:52:55] <%kiiiirsten> wtf I want pizza
[0:52:55] <%UltraCasualBoom> Stick with McDonalds Paige

[0:52:58] <%CubicPhantom> Paige it's your pizza's thicc descriptor
[0:53:01] <%PenmanLupine> Deep Dish is a sauce and cheese cake
[0:53:04] <deviljhojho94> This one is utter shit
[0:53:05] <applesonthemoon> 16 inches of pizza eating POWER
[0:53:05] <+other_badger> @AngriestPat get deep dish and have paige roast it like you roast fake poutine
[0:53:05] <%valriot> apatBig NOPE
[0:53:06] <+Blargimazombie> Pan pizza is fuckin great
[0:53:06] <%AncelDeLambert> lies, it's fun
[0:53:07] <FearDasZombie> I quite like Little Ceasars
[0:53:07] <shurtal> it's a great vault
[0:53:08] <%konekoryugamine> Why is this the worst?
[0:53:08] <applesonthemoon> in a PAN
[0:53:11] <%konekoryugamine> WHAT IS THAT
[0:53:12] <%snow_bush> Death is preferable to this dungeon
[0:53:14] <AlasterAngelo> what about salad tossed pizza
[0:53:14] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat it can't beat Vault 19
[0:53:14] <%Raxus_Secundus> That poor plant person
[0:53:15] <%kiiiirsten> @ThatGuyfromMars How could you not enjoy carrots, nature's candy?
[0:53:16] <Animal_Farm4> I still think the radioactive vault is the worst, it's just obnoxious to be in
[0:53:16] <+CarrowayFashonti> Agreed
[0:53:17] <BallinArbiter> That’s right
[0:53:18] <%konekoryugamine> THE HELL
[0:53:18] <ChibiKuro> elaISee
[0:53:18] <%commanderclaw> Spore is a creepy word
[0:53:19] <%skizzuto> that didn't seem so bad
[0:53:19] <rockworm> those things used to scare the shit out of me
[0:53:19] <+Emperor_Bad> pan pizza is attracted to other pizza regardless of gender
[0:53:19] <wirblewomble> it's not though
[0:53:20] <%LowBatteryLife> Best vault in new vegas, because of those motherfuckers. Coolest.
[0:53:21] <+TheWallOfMeat> It's nowhere near as bad as you think
[0:53:22] <%Kahnicus> i like it least cause it's a bitch to navigate with like 3 different areas
[0:53:23] <%RaikenTB> the plants in RE2 looks like this now.
[0:53:24] <%AmaniIsYourBoss> Never been to this vault, oof WutFace
[0:53:24] <%Codemaster7777> BEST VAULT YOURE WRONG
[0:53:24] <%RageKingDomo> my dog is liking the stream!
[0:53:24] <%lewdskeletor13> HATE these fucks
[0:53:25] <ScreamingMeat> The clickers
[0:53:25] <Valentinius_Anodyne> @konekoryugamine LUL
[0:53:26] <derap41> And its a confusing mess
[0:53:26] <%AncelDeLambert> stop hating on the plant zombies, you big baby
[0:53:27] <nobody12349> Those things make me so paranoid
[0:53:27] <%joylent_blue> they aren't even hard they just jump scare your ass
[0:53:27] <%konekoryugamine> That looked like a fucking green goblin ripoff!
[0:53:29] <deviljhojho94> The true hell of this vault are the elevatores
[0:53:29] <%crimsonharvest> i cant believe how wrong that opinion is
[0:53:31] <+Answer_Moose> Pan Pizza = Eating your pizza on top of a bread stick
[0:53:33] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten carrots make me vom. There is a reason I wear glasses
[0:53:33] <natebud> it's really not so bad, and not nearly as confusing
[0:53:34] <corepool> i hate it too confusing
[0:53:35] <%Codemaster7777> apatHoldon apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong apatWrong

[0:53:40] <+TheWallOfMeat> 1
[0:53:40] <Dozale> you'll get to blow it tho
[0:53:40] <Them00n> It's like a survival horror game. @AngriestPat
[0:53:40] <%cinder_chan> dude this vault would be my fav if not for the loading screens and shit
[0:53:41] <%Kahnicus> but you can also do one entire quest and two partial quests here
[0:53:41] <%dmdyne99> BURN IT ALL CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit CurseLit
[0:53:47] <%ItsRatman> scientists of the body?!?
[0:53:47] <%konekoryugamine> That looked like a kappa cross mated with a Symbiote!
[0:53:47] <PSI_Guy95> Let's just skip that lrore dump
[0:53:48] <BallinArbiter> Stop booing him he’s right
[0:53:49] <FearDasZombie> Did Pat just use a hunting rifle on a point blank enemy when he has a Riot Shotgun?
[0:53:57] <PSI_Guy95> EMLO
[0:53:58] <catwithsunglasses> these guys are piss easy with melee and knowing where they are and killing them before they activate, that's really all the solace I have
[0:53:58] <alrobot2014> it would be the worst vault if vault 19 didn't exist to literally be so out of the way that you could not realize it didn't exist
[0:54:01] <Moisthoodie> boomer vaut is pretty bad
[0:54:03] <%Mirrorcatch> this vault always freaks me out for some reason
[0:54:05] <Conky89> The whole gimmick of Little Caeser's is to get lots of cheap pizza. You went to the wrong place expecting above average quality.
[0:54:06] <%Cogito1001> Pan is good or bad based on the place. ITs not universal at all.
[0:54:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @FearDasZombie Paciencia has a better crit rate
[0:54:07] <%lewdskeletor13> SHOW EMLO
[0:54:08] <BakedPretzels> its not that bad just shoot the guys till they die
[0:54:09] <%konekoryugamine> That looked like the Swamp Thing turned into Legion!
[0:54:10] <%cylish> yaaaaaaay there is a stream
[0:54:10] <+ShadowArcangel> Do you have a flamethrower or something for these guys?
[0:54:13] <%konekoryugamine> Oh I can keep going.
[0:54:18] <%kiiiirsten> Instead of show bepis the mood tonight is "SHOW ELMO"
[0:54:19] <Dozale> who is MELO?
[0:54:22] <%Codemaster7777> Pat continues to be wrong like the looser he is
[0:54:25] <+TastySammiches> this is the only part of the game where the flamer is useful at all
[0:54:26] <FearDasZombie> But a Riot Shotgun
[0:54:35] <+VanaSkiller> alrighty then
[0:54:35] <%kiiiirsten> Sneaky

[0:54:41] <%joylent_blue> they are H I D I N G
[0:54:47] <FearDasZombie> Who needs crits when you can deliver every individual pellet into something's face

[0:55:35] <Gorgen> crikD
[0:55:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> the best thing about fallout 4 is them turning power armor into the iron man suit

[1:36:23] <derap41> Why have pulse gun when you can have pulse slugs
[1:36:24] <dekkitout> the only good color in skyrim is black reach and the occasional trip through riften to break up the grey smear
[1:36:25] <%Eaglestrike117> @AngriestPat you could have put a silencer on it
[1:36:27] <%rockcentuar> How is barter bad?

[1:36:37] <%Raxus_Secundus> Can you sell quest items?
[1:36:39] <%Totally_not_toby> honest hearts is the worst but it's still good
[1:36:40] <%Niney_Who> Pistols don't care for you pat

[1:48:23] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Finakala and the game being unplayable once the save reaches like 500mb
[1:48:23] <%RaikenTB> UNGH
[1:48:27] <%kiiiirsten> Stupid bugs

[1:48:34] <%kiiiirsten> Do you like the sight of your own BLAD, radscorpions?!
[1:48:36] <Finakala> FONV actually bricked my first PS3
[1:48:37] <Bouldus> @khalcipher you mean Danny Trejo's accent?
[1:48:48] <Parapattern> It speaks to this games greatness that I still played it to completion while dealing with all the issues of it's day-one release on PS3
[1:48:49] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat if you find the entrance to quarry junction from this side you can save yourself some time and get the deathclaw eggs
[1:48:50] <CrabSlacks> Boone cramps my "stay neutral with Caesar while kill all his dudes" style
[1:48:51] <Coystick> Offer butt for Pizza
[1:48:51] <+pl0xzz> WE DO IT
[1:48:55] <%Magnion> @angriestpat are you gonna play the DLC for this?
[1:48:56] <%easternstealth> That's rad
[1:48:56] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I wouldn't doubt it. I hate that Gamebryo has so many problems on the PS3
[1:48:58] <laguerrilha> oof
[1:49:02] <pive123456> pat I want you to open my cheeks like a treasure chest and eat that sweet gold
[1:49:02] <%SvenHolgersson> R I P
[1:49:04] <faldin> skyrim bricked my og fat ps3
[1:49:06] <zerocruz> MACHETE MATA
[1:49:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Parapattern oh man Day 1 New Vegas was something else
[1:49:07] <Dakuu75> "brick"'d it?! how the fuck even?
[1:49:08] <dekkitout> damn son
[1:49:19] <%CerberusDriver> @Finakala remember that Skyrim PS3 bug that made your game slower the more times you saved
[1:49:19] <derap41> its the Khan entrance
[1:49:19] <%Kahnicus> takes you to the great kahn campsite
[1:49:19] <Zebroneath> uh oh
[1:49:21] <Latch77> playing bethesda games on console LUL
[1:49:22] <+Varnarok> Don't shoot the Khans
[1:49:23] <%nelsonq415> whats bricked?
[1:49:24] <FracturedImage> finally gonna clear the quarry?
[1:49:26] <Sielas> @AngriestPat When are ya gonna stream Planescape
[1:49:26] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat its part of the Khans quest
[1:49:26] <nicotrumpet> ps3 is a wacky system in general apparently
[1:49:28] <haisho> @Finakala Sounds like Bethesda quality to me! If it ain't on PC, it'll probably brick it.
[1:49:29] <dekkitout> time to bust some deathclaw borks?
[1:49:32] <$CharlesRobinJr> Same my ps3 also almost died playing this game
[1:49:33] <deviljhojho94> fighting gold
[1:49:33] <%Nobrev> new vegas almost bricked my ps3 too. this game is absolutely awful on ps3
[1:49:34] <%kiiiirsten> The Great Khans are up there like "oops we accidentally got dicked by like 100 deathclaws"
[1:49:35] <%PenmanLupine> oh yeah, I forgot about the place with the Khans
[1:49:38] <+khalcipher> The accent of Raul is SUPER racist in spanish FailFish (last time i say this)
[1:49:41] <%Kahnicus> i don't think you can get to the eggs from there though, they're oin the nest
[1:49:43] <+DukeMoose> Wew, caught the helicopter gunshop show from shotshow and now some pat
[1:49:43] <pive123456> @angriestpat I want you inside me
[1:49:46] <%Kahnicus> in
[1:49:52] <zerocruz> Is it tho ?
[1:49:52] <natebud> There's some good stuff besides deathclaw eggs in Dead Wind Cavern
[1:49:53] <laguerrilha> I never remember the path of the side entrance. i just walk around the mountain until i find it
[1:49:53] <%SiameseSneeze> pew pew
[1:49:54] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat you climb the mountain along a pass guarded by deathclaws.
[1:49:54] <st_jimmy456> @nelsonq415 broke the console to the point where it was essentially an expensive brick
[1:49:55] <derap41> Just hug the wall
[1:49:56] <%joylent_blue> khalcipher you mean the spanish dub??
[1:49:59] <Tucker0603> @nelsonq415 it means it's so fucked that all it can be is a brick
[1:50:03] <%Kahnicus> @natebud MERCY
[1:50:04] <Fujiwara_92> PIZZA TIME
[1:50:09] <%oKentucky> @AngriestPat I just want to say you are doing great! This is an awesome stream :D
[1:50:16] <DSD24> @Nobrev Even then its still better than Skyrim on PS3 that one is the train wreck
[1:50:16] <natebud> @Kahnicus DAMN STRAIGHT
[1:50:17] <laguerrilha> Just hug the wall
[1:50:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @st_jimmy456 oh man were you one of those 599 ps3 owners
[1:50:23] <+DukeMoose> fiddle with the other map?
[1:50:24] <%lewdskeletor13> Hall Wug
[1:50:24] <%Totally_not_toby> "am i going in the right way"
[1:50:28] <alrobot2014> it requires some hallwugging
[1:50:29] <%kiiiirsten> @natebud I think you need a specially pinged Deathclaw egg item that appears when you activate the quest but it's 2019 now and idk anything
[1:50:32] <CrabSlacks> invisiblessed walls
[1:50:32] <%kiiiirsten> Wow BIG cheating blocker
[1:50:32] <zerocruz> I want some pizza too...
[1:50:35] <%commanderclaw> Gotta love them invisible walls
[1:50:35] <%joylent_blue> ah, nice invisible walls
[1:50:37] <derap41> Gotta fight those cazadors
[1:50:38] <Gorgen> jermaDisgust
[1:50:38] <%LouieRouie> Good job
[1:50:38] <Sielas> See that mountain? You can climb it
[1:50:39] <dekkitout> invisible wall, we meet again...
[1:50:41] <Dakuu75> DO A FLIP
[1:50:45] <%Kahnicus> @natebud mercy and annabelle, for when things can't be small enough giblets
[1:50:45] <%CerberusDriver> cazadors
[1:50:47] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten I mean I can look at the guide..
[1:50:48] <zerocruz> TCL
[1:50:50] <alrobot2014> TOO FAR NORTH
[1:50:50] <%LouieRouie> but why
[1:50:51] <+TheChampionofBoxes> gotta love those invisible walls
[1:50:52] <%the_mental_punk> working in pizza made me realize you should never order on weekend. if you want a consistently good quality pizza order it on Monday through Thursday between 1-4 pm
[1:50:52] <Ragnakawaii> Cazadors monkaS
[1:50:53] <%mostundesired> See that wall?
[1:50:56] <%rdark_ksu> fuck cazadors
[1:50:56] <st_jimmy456> @ThatGuyfromMars no but my mate from school was. learned my lesson and waited a bit
[1:50:56] <+secretspud> it's a feature, not a bug.
[1:50:56] <catwithsunglasses> at least when the white 360 red rings, it's still a decent space heater
[1:50:57] <nicotrumpet> skyrim also broke its own save after a certain point right
[1:50:58] <krymzen5> odd to see it in the map
[1:51:00] <%AncelDeLambert> the "side" entrance is to the north, I believe
[1:51:00] <Breaburn_op> TOO HIGH
[1:51:01] <%TheDude8D> What perk did pat get at 24??
[1:51:04] <pive123456> @angriestpat Pat I want you to open my cheeks with your tiny leprechaun hands and eat my goodies out
[1:51:04] <%kabermano> Lazy map design or the work of an ENEMY STAND?
[1:51:05] <%SvenHolgersson> Cazador sounds like the big bad in a DnD campaign
[1:51:05] <Fujiwara_92> Pat found a invisible wall making him tonight's big loser
[1:51:08] <DSD24> The worst noise in this game
[1:51:08] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@majindusto)
[1:51:09] <%Jjrossman> WOOZY
[1:51:11] <dekkitout> PogChamp he did a flip
[1:51:11] <Finakala> Yeah, Skyrim on PS3 was broken as hell too
[1:51:17] <%Nobrev> @DSD24 strangely enough I always had far less trouble with skyrim on my ps3 than with new vegas. I don't know how my ps3 managed that at all
[1:51:19] <+InugamiTheHound> always double tap the same wing @AngriestPat
[1:51:20] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @st_jimmy456 man props to your friend for being nuts enough to buy the 600$ ps3
[1:51:20] <+ThePayphone> best weapon against any amount of cazadors is the light machinegun+
[1:51:21] <+TheChampionofBoxes> fuck that cazador noise
[1:51:26] <%kabermano> @majindusto Another is claimed by the caps lock tyranny
[1:51:27] <alrobot2014> you went too far north
[1:51:29] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat You collecting uniques?
[1:51:32] <%CerberusDriver> and they never ever fixed it

[1:51:48] <DSD24> @Nobrev Weird I had the opposite did all the DLC with NV without issue except for Lonesome Road and Skyrim was just a big mess
[1:51:51] <%joylent_blue> ps3 Bayonetta is an experience
[1:51:52] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat Too far Weast actually
[1:51:52] <%tinyswampthing> wasnt fallout 3 on ps3 awful too
[1:51:53] <+IronPickle> David Cage says you can never go to far North
[1:51:53] <Breaburn_op> Honestly Skyrim was more broken for me than New Vegas or 3 ever was.
[1:51:54] <derap41> oh boy more insects

[1:52:04] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @nicotrumpet lord I don't want to think about the days before Bayo was nintendo
[1:52:06] <Dozale> nope, towards cazadors then right
[1:52:07] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat it requires a bit of wall huging on the hill
[1:52:08] <%lewdskeletor13> EMLO apatWhat
[1:52:08] <Finakala> Bayo on PS3 at least ran, can't really say the same for most Bethesda games
[1:52:11] <%TheDude8D> what perk did pat get at 24?

[1:52:46] <Gorgen> ScaredyCat
[1:52:46] <%WackyXmand> Skyrim on PS3 was what made me stop playing it. Completely broke and locked me out of an entire DLC campaign on my main file.
[1:52:47] <%king_wragles> @TheDude8D either grimreaper's or action boy
[1:52:47] <%Nobrev> @DSD24 maybe my shitty jank old hand me down ps3 and the shitty jank version of skyrim cancelled each other out
[1:52:49] <CrimsonFox777> Can we get a stream where it's just Elmo sitting on the couch meowing every now and then for a few hours?

[1:53:09] <Dakuu75> it's not a proper open-world-game without invisible walls from god
[1:53:10] <Conky89> The PS3 might have been the most powerful console last gen, but it was a whole beast in of itself. Many developers were at first completely confused by it.
[1:53:10] <Finakala> I never even bothered with Skyrim's DLC, partially because I didn't care that much for Skyrim and partially because my save is beyond wrecked
[1:53:20] <CrabSlacks> just get in there and kick there ass's, you have an anti material rifle

[2:27:50] <$awsomesaucekirby> cheer500 lies, Saints Row Gat outa hell had a musical sequence right in the middle. You know that song "big iron" from this game? Someone made a warhammer 40k parody version, about an inquisitor. You can probably play that instead of the actual song, to set the game's mood, without getting in trouble due to copyright shenanigans.

[3:05:08] <%Niney_Who> You use VATS
[3:05:10] <+smargh1015> @konekoryugamine yes but those sex noises were 💯 laura bailey
[3:05:11] <%TheDude8D> It’s a shotgun who needs range?
[3:05:14] <%Niney_Who> DPS Doesn't matter with VATS
[3:05:14] <Fujiwara_92> BUT...
[3:05:15] <%lewdskeletor13> Now THIS is the zapping system
[3:05:16] <%konekoryugamine> @joylent_blue I don't want to ask how you knwo that
[3:05:17] <%AncelDeLambert> Pat, you use VATS, higher damage per SHOT is preferable to you
[3:05:20] <UrsulaCat> you don't take your feet off you get your feet off ;)
[3:05:20] <natebud> better range = more pellets hit
[3:05:21] <%king_wragles> @AngriestPat anti material rifle has better range than dinner bell....

[3:29:37] <%joylent_blue> his backstory is so sad FeelsBadMan
[3:29:39] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @konekoryugamine I know and I was responding in kind ;D
[3:29:40] <%Codemaster7777> His quest broke tho
[3:29:48] <Geno4344> how'd he avoid going feral
[3:29:49] <%rdark_ksu> Pat do you have any plans to get the special melee take downs?
[3:29:50] <%HDmexiqtioner> Any chance we can get a reading @AngriestPat
[3:29:51] <%kabermano> Oh now i feel bad for calling him needy earlier. Poor Raul
[3:29:52] <%Codemaster7777> Like 237
[3:29:54] <Will9099> And he used to be a sick gunslinger
[3:29:54] <DrDomVonDoom> Chewie and Fuckface
[3:29:55] <FracturedImage> and a gunslinger
[3:29:55] <%Codemaster7777> I did the math
[3:29:57] <Bouldus> i thought his main thing was he was Danny Trejo?
[3:29:58] <alrobot2014> and that he's FUCKING DANNY TREJO
[3:30:01] <%konekoryugamine> How broken?
[3:30:03] <dekkitout> and hes the closest to being a skeleton
[3:30:04] <TikanZK> MIDAIR
[3:30:04] <%Codemaster7777> And a good brother
[3:30:05] <bjornbjeardson> He gets a sick costume though
[3:30:06] <%Kahnicus> I like his story but Trejo phoned it in
[3:30:06] <%OwlLightningMage> It's so fucking buggy
[3:30:09] <DracaenaLeaf> Those lips holy shit
[3:30:09] <PSI_Guy95> is she having an allergic reaction
[3:30:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Geno4344 it's all dependent on the radiation a ghoul takes
[3:30:12] <ShichiNoBushi> Jump before dialogue so you hover.
[3:30:12] <%konekoryugamine> How broken is his quest?
[3:30:13] <daisymaisy02> @Geno4344 Honestly it's kinda vague what makes a ghoul go feral
[3:30:14] <zerocruz> You mean MACHETE
[3:30:15] <%Quigsies> That face jfc
[3:30:17] <%connos_livereview> trejos tacos
[3:30:18] <alrobot2014> @konekoryugamine if you talk to some people without him his quest breaks

[3:30:40] <%Codemaster7777> Is it good

[3:31:20] <%Kahnicus> Watched the VoD from yesterday I think, talking about pooping from your butt eye, at that point they become Poopils.
[3:31:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ShichiNoBushi badass, I didn't know he drinks starbucks
[3:31:21] <%joylent_blue> its important that the cheese is on the floor when it is sucked
[3:31:22] <zerocruz> YOU KNEW?
[3:31:24] <derap41> So you gonna blow these people up?
[3:31:26] <%Codemaster7777> Get him to move on and to make your gear better
[3:31:27] <%rdark_ksu> paige can only do the best with which god gave her
[3:31:29] <FracturedImage> Desert Ranger > Power Armor
[3:31:32] <%ThePuddingDead> now shoot him
[3:31:34] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige scrapes the cheese off the burgers onto the ground for the Pat to suck PogChamp
[3:31:34] <%lewdskeletor13> You’re not the boss of me Paige PunOko
[3:31:36] <dekkitout> thanks yosuke uchiha-parker
[3:31:38] <%kabermano> Oh are we talking about sucking floor chese?

[3:31:51] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat if you want enclave armor you can be crazy and go to the Deathclaw Promontory
[3:31:52] <%Quigsies> Wow, couldn't even spring for new power armor huh?
[3:31:53] <%konekoryugamine> @OwlLightningMage NO, she did like Beck and got crazy with the Cheese Whiz
[3:31:58] <+Dovakhin573> This fucking part bugged out for me I WAS SO MAD
[3:31:58] <Mnightshyamallama> 4 ruined power armor for me
[3:32:01] <ShichiNoBushi> My brother was on break at the time and only saw him from behind, but his coworker at the register nodded at him confirming it was him.
[3:32:02] <adamisfruit> Divide ranger armor >>>>>> power armor
[3:32:02] <bjornbjeardson> Floor cheese= Best cheese
[3:32:02] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat DEATHCLAW PROMONTORY
[3:32:03] <derap41> one thing fallout 4 did better was power armor
[3:32:03] <%OwlLightningMage> LUL
[3:32:04] <+ArcLifth> Ye ye ye
[3:32:06] <%Niney_Who> Go get that cool Remnant Armor

[3:32:07] <AlasterAngelo> 4's Power Armor is nice
[3:32:12] <tacobearninja1> Thanks, Sasuke.
[3:32:15] <kingdudeby> 4 does power armor really well.
[3:32:15] <%Prism_Wing> Why do people keep saying yosuke?
[3:32:15] <+InugamiTheHound> okay I'm back from the quick mass effect 1 stream . Done with eden prime.
[3:32:16] <raven_frame> Elder McNamara undressing Pat over here.
[3:32:18] <%RageKingDomo> i just replayed 4 and they ruined alot of shit in that one
[3:32:20] <%joylent_blue> shut the fuck up Sasuke
[3:32:21] <%TheDude8D> 4’s power armor is awful right me
[3:32:21] <dekkitout> and now pat has the mangekeyou power armor
[3:32:22] <derap41> hehehe
[3:32:23] <%lewdskeletor13> Thanks old Man Yuri
[3:32:23] <kingdudeby> 40 percent of the men in this game are susuke.
[3:32:24] <%Dualparadoxes> you should do arcade's quest for that awesome enclave armor
[3:32:24] <Sleepology> shoot him
[3:32:24] <%ThePuddingDead> shoot him now
[3:32:25] <+bear_breaker20> Funny how this one quest makes power armors feel morte special than the entirety of 4
[3:32:26] <DXLelouch24> KILL HIM PAT
[3:32:28] <DXLelouch24> KILL SASUKE
[3:32:29] <PSI_Guy95> blow them all up!
[3:32:30] <%SirTopHat_III> I actually really like 4’s power armor system. I just hated the rest of 4z
[3:32:31] <Desertfishing> Steal all the tech
[3:32:31] <%Kahnicus> Honest Hearts ranger armor trumps Divide armor
[3:32:33] <%Tearonex> time to wear the remnants power armour and NEVER look back
[3:32:34] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kingdudeby more like 85%
[3:32:34] <CrimsonFox777> Time to blow everything up.
[3:32:35] <%kabermano> @Prism_Wing This be Yosuke's voice actor and he using the same voice
[3:32:35] <+G_Thunders> 4 turned power armor into like a weird gimmicky thing for the series
[3:32:36] <%joylent_blue> BLOW EM UP
[3:32:38] <alexandrecau> you culled our asshole soldiers too
[3:32:39] <%Brandon__Brando> NO BLOW THEM UP

[3:32:47] <%Niney_Who> Yes
[3:32:47] <kingdudeby> My percentile was off.
[3:32:48] <ScreamingMeat> YES
[3:32:49] <+primax104> Hi Patrick!

[3:33:18] <%ThePuddingDead> naughty nightwear tho
[3:33:21] <%Mornaka> 96 caps though
[3:33:22] <kingdudeby> Fallout 4 made power armor feel powerful, but made it so common that it doesn't feel special.
[3:33:22] <mjmanning> get the enclave power armor
[3:33:22] <+InugamiTheHound> you gotta repair it

[3:34:06] <%xijiy> apatHoldon
[3:34:06] <%Codemaster7777> 45d isn't great but winterized 51-b from operation Anchorage cant be beat
[3:34:08] <+StromkoPenguin> Fallout 4 also gives you a minigun super early in the story, so they balanced it to be utterly worthless against enemies higher than like level 5
[3:34:09] <%kabermano> @Prism_Wing I wouldn't know but i think he also uses the same voice for Sasuke's dub
[3:34:14] <Gerik1233> why couldn't veronica teach you how to wear power armor?

[3:36:18] <%PaladinDupre> @AngriestPat if you get your BARTER to 50 before you do the TALENT SEARCH QUEST you can give RAUL and awesome unique REVOLVER that plays MUSIC when drawn

[3:40:51] <%kiiiirsten> that's just how it is on this bitch of an earth
[3:40:51] <derap41> They Crawled out trough the fallout
[3:41:00] <deviljhojho94> Danny trejo cant even properly pronounce spanish as raul
[3:41:00] <+G_Thunders> In Fallout 4, why did the BoS hate ghouls like this? Did they just not think lucid ghouls existed?
[3:41:02] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Kahnicus Kris Kristofferson might've, I haven't done that quest in a while
[3:41:03] <Idon__> oof that's rough

[3:41:24] <+InugamiTheHound> man 3rd world country like mexico would be hit really hard by the nukes
[3:41:28] <kingdudeby> Because the BoS were never suppose to be good guys and in 4 they're as close to how the original BoS has been in a while.
[3:41:28] <%FrostMass22> @g_thunders bad writing
[3:41:32] <%HDmexiqtioner> That's why the cartels are still a shit
[3:41:35] <valachi> @G_Thunders It's about the eventual danger that Ghouls represent iirc. Also shitty writing.
[3:41:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten it's raul, I don't think they got a good quality recording

[3:42:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @primax104 a lot of famous people are in the game
[3:42:12] <%rdark_ksu> i need closure
[3:42:13] <%ThePuddingDead> wow things got brown and fast
[3:42:14] <derap41> not forlorn nelson
[3:42:16] <Parapattern> Pretty much every country went to shit before the war
[3:42:16] <kingdudeby> Voice acting requires a lot of direction to get what you want from the actors. I don't think they had time to get a good performance out of him.
[3:42:25] <kingdudeby> since the game was made in 18 months and all.
[3:42:27] <%Kahnicus> @ThatGuyfromMars Yeah, Hanlon's a bit rough too.
[3:42:29] <trbrovah> man the ghouls in these games are always the coolest characters
[3:42:30] <Xaxas115> why is Raul's face not changed with the mod?

[3:42:38] <%xijiy> Raul's voice actor did a great job
[3:42:39] <PSI_Guy95> Paige is very quiet
[3:42:40] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kingdudeby Yeah, they cut out a character because her voice acting wasn't good enough
[3:42:41] <%kabermano> @kingdudeby I dunno, the somber slow Danny has it's charm for Raul
[3:42:42] <%xijiy> Or were you talking about someone else
[3:42:43] <Pyrrhus90> jingle jangle
[3:42:46] <dekkitout> there was a global fossil fuel shortage, except in alaska, so us and china warred over that and- well you know the rest
[3:42:47] <Pistachius> lol "private sexton"
[3:42:49] <%OwlLightningMage> Paige is not feeling well BibleThump
[3:42:50] <+Nomicro4u> Yay drugs

[3:42:58] <nobody12349> @Xaxas115 Because he's already perfect
[3:43:01] <%Codemaster7777> is pat talking about sucking dick again
[3:43:01] <CircadianRhythmm> @alrobot2014 damn so did they just say fuck it and shot missiles at everyone or were the bombs just that devastating lol
[3:43:03] <Izuurus> @xaxas115 His face is too cool for mods
[3:43:05] <+TONYOO101> he's outside near the rocks
[3:43:06] <UrsulaCat> pat should I go to sleep
[3:43:07] <+willtheprofessional> Europe amalgameted into the European Commonwealth before the bombs dropped, and its rumored that EU is even WORSE OFF than the American wasteland
[3:43:07] <Geno4344> Raul's a perfect pretty princess
[3:43:07] <+空の女王> the old man likes to hang out in the main building
[3:43:08] <bjornbjeardson> I think he's still at The airport

[3:43:46] <%Codemaster7777> fucksake
[3:43:51] <%OwlLightningMage> He said the line PogChamp
[3:43:52] <FracturedImage> LUL
[3:43:57] <+StromkoPenguin> Europe is pretty densely urbanized and populated so it'd get hit really heavy in a global thermonuclear war.
[3:44:03] <+Nomicro4u> SPLOOSH
[3:44:04] <Idon__> SPLOOSH
[3:44:08] <%Kahnicus> some of 1st recon stay in the command tent... ther eya go
[3:44:08] <Desertfishing> big splash
[3:44:09] <dekkitout> its hard to say who shot first -theres even some possibility it was alien intervention-
[3:44:10] <%OwlLightningMage> Big splash PogChamp
[3:44:10] <alrobot2014> @CircadianRhythmm then the chinese and americans nuked the shit out of each other and all their territory, including all of North America since it got mostly annexed
[3:44:15] <%Fidranth> Kaboom!
[3:44:20] <%connos_livereview> JESUS
[3:44:23] <PSI_Guy95> old as fuck
[3:44:27] <derap41> Take his gun
[3:44:27] <Parapattern> His face is made of bronze
[3:44:27] <%kiiiirsten> Wow he looks good actually
[3:44:30] <%iwishthiswasicq> Sterling? Fucking prick.
[3:44:35] <kingdudeby> looks like he's been dead for a week
[3:44:35] <+primax104> that is a good name for a ranger
[3:44:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> that mustache tho
[3:44:38] <slothslayer828> fake nose
[3:44:39] <Nomad_Scholar> I was able to kill him for the gun
[3:44:40] <%kabermano> This guy is 10 years from being a ghoul. In a good way though
[3:44:40] <Mnightshyamallama> his voice doesn't match his face
[3:44:44] <%ForeverDarkness> jesus christ his face is fucked
[3:44:45] <excelsenor> lanaaaaaa
[3:44:47] <CircadianRhythmm> @alrobot2014 damn I always wondered what fallout game would be like in another country guess that answers that
[3:44:47] <dekkitout> corporal sterling? not colonel?
[3:44:48] <derap41> Steal it
[3:44:55] <raven_frame> Jesus Christ, he's melting right in front of us!
[3:44:55] <AlasterAngelo> awwwww
[3:44:55] <Will9099> @AngriestPat What is your favorite side story in new vegas?
[3:45:03] <The_Blumper> hes pretty old to be a Corporal
[3:45:04] <%FrostMass22> What's wrong with his face!?
[3:45:11] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @FrostMass22 mods
[3:45:13] <+StromkoPenguin> Get his beloved gun so you can add it to your collection of uniques and never use it.
[3:45:13] <bjornbjeardson> Dude's old
[3:45:16] <dekkitout> no- like sander- nevermind...
[3:45:17] <bricupcake> omg he looks so bad haha
[3:45:17] <%kabermano> My dude rocking the melting moustache witch look, good for him.
[3:45:22] <%Agami23> the hat
[3:45:24] <AlasterAngelo> don't take this poor man's gun away from him
[3:45:26] <+bear_breaker20> lmao cannibal joke
[3:45:26] <Xaxas115> StromkoPenguin nah he will sell it
[3:45:47] <derap41> You know how Legion like their butt piracy
[3:46:00] <%connos_livereview> Take his gun
[3:46:01] <%Kahnicus> I just add it via console if it's on a character I don't wanna splatter.
[3:46:02] <+willtheprofessional> Legion are HUGE ass pirates
[3:46:18] <dekkitout> always with the booty plundering, those legion boys
[3:46:32] <%ThatGuyfromMars> we all know the legion are full of butt pirates
[3:46:32] <%vincerocmm> el photama
[3:46:32] <%Kahnicus> Roman Lovers.
[3:46:33] <%connos_livereview> no
[3:46:35] <The_Blumper> Why is he so old and only a Corporal?
[3:46:48] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @The_Blumper the military can fuck you like taht
[3:46:49] <derap41> heh
[3:46:50] <ScreamingMeat> LUL
[3:47:01] <PSI_Guy95> damn a lot of navelgazing from a guy we met not even an hour ago
[3:47:13] <%Kahnicus> @The_Blumper That's what happens to renegades, get nowhere pissing off the chain of command.
[3:47:17] <+willtheprofessional> Pat, are you really going for the Old Vaquero for Raul? i thought you just said its trash?
[3:47:19] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I never did Raul's quest, is Rafaela still alive
[3:47:22] <Calamity2007> Raul is one of the best companions in this game imho
[3:47:32] <kingdudeby> if you do the math on when Raul was born, when the world ended and everything else. Raul was in his 30s when the bombs fell.
[3:47:33] <Xaxas115> PSI_Guy95 old guy lots of thoughts in the ol' navel
[3:47:34] <bjornbjeardson> I think he's going for the full maintainence perk
[3:47:42] <%Kahnicus> @ThatGuyfromMars He tells in the diabologue
[3:47:44] <%Romulus1213> !uptime
[3:47:44] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 47m.
[3:47:45] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[3:47:48] <FracturedImage> This game has gud writing
[3:47:51] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Kahnicus gotcha
[3:47:55] <%Stratiotai2> guys lived a long time
[3:47:55] <+willtheprofessional> To get the full maintenece, you have to tell hin to retire
[3:47:57] <%Kahnicus> Dialogue, not diabologue, that;s sinister
[3:47:58] <%AncelDeLambert> wait, you're not going Vaquero?
[3:48:00] <Gorgen> jermaDafoe So handsome
[3:48:02] <The_Blumper> BUT THE COOL OUTFIT
[3:48:04] <raven_frame> This is supposed to be happening over the course of weeks, however Pat is min maxing it.
[3:48:04] <+InugamiTheHound> i guess trump's wall didn't't help LOL
[3:48:06] <%bread_assassin> @AngriestPat Because you're picking the opposite options.
[3:48:14] <%AncelDeLambert> Cuz you're choosing Vaquerro options
[3:48:14] <+willtheprofessional> If you tell him not to retire, you dont get full maintenence
[3:48:16] <Calamity2007> Pat is the dream killer
[3:48:26] <%OwlLightningMage> 1
[3:48:27] <bjornbjeardson> Yeah the vaquero costume is cool but the perk isn't worth it
[3:48:27] <Estuko> FeelsGoodMan
[3:48:30] <%Kahnicus> You can tell him which one with a skill check though Pat @AngriestPat
[3:48:36] <derap41> oh come on the dress is way cooler
[3:48:38] <+DoubleKayga> i think at the end he can just choose either option
[3:48:40] <+willtheprofessional> you'll have to reload
[3:48:45] <derap41> you don't need the repair
[3:48:45] <ScreamingMeat> Crush his ambitions
[3:48:47] <+TONYOO101> you get a sweet cowboy hat tho
[3:48:47] <+willtheprofessional> you've done 2 of 3 i think
[3:48:50] <%BlueMoonBlues> You can choose between his outcomes at the end
[3:48:52] <Parapattern> Taking a page out of Raiden's book
[3:48:58] <+willtheprofessional> oh thats right
[3:48:59] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat Speech check just resets the conversations at the end. This doesn't matter.
[3:49:02] <Fujiwara_92> he has to retire for full maintenance
[3:49:07] <+willtheprofessional> nvm mind Pat, youre good
[3:49:08] <FracturedImage> you change the out come with a speech check at the end
[3:49:11] <Xaxas115> its just like with boone, you can tell him either
[3:49:11] <DrDomVonDoom> Id think Ghouls would be in constant excruciating pain at all times.
[3:49:13] <%Fidranth> he... must... REITRE...
[3:49:14] <+willtheprofessional> you can just choose at the end
[3:49:18] <%Kahnicus> Yup yup
[3:49:19] <%Stratiotai2> there you go
[3:49:23] <adamisfruit> You don’t need additional repair, let him a hero
[3:49:25] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @DrDomVonDoom they don't really mention it if they do
[3:49:30] <derap41> Buster Raul
[3:49:39] <Fujiwara_92> VAQUERO IS COOLER
[3:49:41] <kingra> Repair is garbo be a big hero
[3:49:41] <FracturedImage> Raul GUN go UP
[3:49:43] <$TheBlackMandalorian> is this dlc
[3:49:43] <%ramielthe5th> BibleThump
[3:49:48] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[3:49:49] <Xaxas115> Gun go up!
[3:49:51] <dekkitout> twiddling my thumbs for the inevitable 100 speech check
[3:49:52] <%Kahnicus> The Repair is probably better but I personally like Raul as a "Ghost Cowboy". Pretty cool.
[3:49:52] <Will9099> Local man too angry to retire
[3:49:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> oh man
[3:49:58] <Idon__> wow that's... roooooough
[3:49:59] <%ThatGuyfromMars> I feel bad for raul now
[3:50:02] <The_Blumper> oh jeex...
[3:50:02] <alrobot2014> @TheBlackMandalorian nope
[3:50:02] <Estuko> Kill all raiders on sight
[3:50:04] <+willtheprofessional> i think letting him be a vaquero is really sad actually. He's holding on to his guns till the very end, ignoring his pain instead of learning to live with it
[3:50:05] <%Quigsies> oof
[3:50:07] <Desertfishing> BibleThump
[3:50:12] <Pistachius> :(
[3:50:13] <derap41> ....shit just got to real
[3:50:15] <%Stratiotai2> right in dem feels
[3:50:15] <+InugamiTheHound> fucked up shit
[3:50:24] <kingdudeby> Raul was 30 when the bombs fell
[3:50:25] <bjornbjeardson> Edgy Danny Trejo is edgy
[3:50:32] <$TheBlackMandalorian> @alrobot2014 thank you
[3:50:36] <Estuko> I want to hug him
[3:50:51] <Xaxas115> Living as Miguel is living a lie, he is Raul!
[3:50:58] <%Kahnicus> @willtheprofessional If he weren't potentially able to keep going forever I'd agree.
[3:51:06] <%kabermano> @bjornbjeardson Is it edgy if he's actually done legit dangerous stuff? I dunno at that point it stops being edgy for me at least
[3:51:08] <%ThePuddingDead> christ
[3:51:10] <Gorgen> he looks like melted cheese
[3:51:13] <%ThePuddingDead> good writing
[3:51:13] <bjornbjeardson> FeelsBadMan
[3:51:16] <DrDomVonDoom> Why is the NPC backstories better then every Protagonist story combined xD
[3:51:22] <%faegbeard> we can't expect god to do all the work
[3:51:27] <dekkitout> Raul "Miguel" Gaiden WHEN
[3:51:32] <BakedPretzels> suck the floor cheese off rauls face
[3:51:35] <+willtheprofessional> @Kahnicus thats assuming he never just gets shot and dies like he wants
[3:51:36] <%RageKingDomo> what do u mean version???
[3:51:36] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead Right? It feels like a breath of fresh air after all the bad bethesda games
[3:51:36] <Izuurus> better than boone's
[3:51:38] <Geno4344> Would Cass suck Raul off the floor?
[3:51:41] <%Fidranth> hey
[3:51:41] <Idon__> HAY
[3:51:41] <rockworm> Raul for Smash
[3:51:44] <%kiiiirsten> hey
[3:51:44] <bjornbjeardson> I'm not saying it's sad
[3:51:45] <Fujiwara_92> VAQUERO IS THE BETTER CAUSE HE REMEMBERS FAMILY Kappa l
[3:51:47] <derap41> Have you gotten Jack laid yet?
[3:51:51] <%Kahnicus> @willtheprofessional I said potentially
[3:51:51] <Commander_Spyke> hey moon2H
[3:51:52] <Estuko> FeelsBadMan
[3:51:55] <%TeraMercier> Just got here, this is a preeetty sweet new stream layout you got pat
[3:51:55] <%FrostMass22> @drdomvondoom The protagonist has to be bland to be a self-insert.
[3:51:56] <bjornbjeardson> *Not sad
[3:51:59] <Xaxas115> Geno4344 would it get her drunk if yes then yeah
[3:52:00] <%kabermano> ...Hey...
[3:52:02] <%ThePuddingDead> Im prolly gonna buy Outer Worlds, just to spite bethesda
[3:52:03] <%ThePuddingDead> :3
[3:52:04] <alrobot2014> jack has not gotten laid yet
[3:52:05] <energywarning> imma just stand here for 10 hours no biggie
[3:52:07] <DrDomVonDoom> BENT NECK LADY
[3:52:09] <%RageKingDomo> does his story change or something????
[3:52:12] <%FrostMass22> Fuck Bethesda
[3:52:21] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Randy "Magician" Pitchford 4 Smash
[3:52:27] <dekkitout> randy no!
[3:52:28] <NlghtSprites> cordWoah1 cordWoah2 Howdy.
[3:52:29] <slothslayer828> JASON!
[3:52:30] <CircadianRhythmm> damn didnt obsidian say they'd be down to do another like this? hindsight is 20 20 huh bethesda?
[3:52:32] <%Kahnicus> @willtheprofessional but he could just as easily get slaughtered when some raiders bust into his shack and wreck his shit up randomly some time
[3:52:35] <rockworm> I to like to spend my money to spite companies who wont be affected by how I spend my money
[3:52:36] <Gorgen> Basterd
[3:52:38] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead It's probably better to buy the Outer Worlds to support Obsidian and their great writing, even tho Chris Avellone is no longer there
[3:52:38] <Mnightshyamallama> pat keeps checking rooms instead of using his compass to see where people are
[3:52:42] <+TheBimbollo> hey guys, when can you start preloading RE2 on PS4?
[3:52:43] <%Breakfast_Megapowers> Randy yes!
[3:52:47] <derap41> God damn he looks worse than Raul
[3:52:55] <%connos_livereview> RANDY WHY
[3:53:04] <alrobot2014> @Mnightshyamallama this quest has no markers
[3:53:09] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TheBimbollo you might be able to now, it won't come out until 12AM on friday tho
[3:53:10] <+willtheprofessional> @Kahnicus also true, but at least he'd finally come to terms with everything. Closure is important and all.
[3:53:11] <%TeraMercier> This is the oldest 40 year old mannequin I've ever seen
[3:53:17] <%ThePuddingDead> Obsidian is still under appreciated as a whole in the industry, so I support good effort, not publishers and half assed management
[3:53:24] <+StromkoPenguin> I heard Bethesda only gave Obsidian like 18 months to get this game out the door.
[3:53:28] <%Fidranth> he's got that "high end xb360 graphics" look
[3:53:29] <AlasterAngelo> literal Boomers
[3:53:31] <$eldrich_horror> @TheBimbollo mines already started downloading
[3:53:43] <%Stratiotai2> he looks like morgan freeman... if morgan freeman did cocaine all hsi life
[3:53:45] <+Not_batman44> !uptime
[3:53:45] <%kiiiirsten> See Pete and get the snowglobe more like
[3:53:45] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 3h 53m.
[3:53:48] <%ThePuddingDead> not *shitty* publishers anyway
[3:53:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead I dunno, Chris Avellone doesn't speak about it much, but he does mention issues with higher ups
[3:53:49] <Mnightshyamallama> @alrobot2014 I am not talking about the quest markers, I am talking about the green pips that are non hostile NPCs
[3:53:57] <alrobot2014> oh ah
[3:53:58] <%Kahnicus> @willtheprofessional I would argue that resolve in the face of failure is the best way to achieve personal growth
[3:54:00] <+willtheprofessional> 18 months that was supposed to be longer, but they cut their time short to try and rush the game out and lower the scores and not give Obsidian bonuses
[3:54:02] <%ThePuddingDead> who doesnt talk about higher ups tho
[3:54:03] <+TheBimbollo> @thatguyfrommars Thanks, gonna check right now and ye I know it doesn't unlock till Thursday night
[3:54:03] <Geno4344> I want a fallout mod that replaces caps with Monster can tabs
[3:54:04] <raven_frame> You can't use the flight simulators because they didn't make a flying minigame.
[3:54:11] <kingdudeby> Zenimax and Obsidian made a deal where Obsidian got to make NV, but they only had 18 months to do it because Obsidian didn't even bother to try and negotiate.
[3:54:20] <James_Quivers> Raul is best companion
[3:54:21] <kingdudeby> A raw deal.
[3:54:29] <+TheBimbollo> @eldrich_horror what's the game size?
[3:54:37] <alrobot2014> and their bonuses were tied to metacritic scores
[3:54:46] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kingdudeby they probably couldn't, they pretty much live paycheck to paycheck until Micro bought them out
[3:54:52] <raven_frame> They still managed to pull out with the best Fallout game somehow.
[3:54:54] <%ForeverDarkness> I love how sassy Raul is
[3:54:58] <Bloodhit> Man Raul was the best.
[3:55:01] <%TeraMercier> Obsidian just shoulda bribed metacritic
[3:55:05] <%Stratiotai2> @thebimbollo should say on ps store
[3:55:07] <$eldrich_horror> @TheBimbollo about 24 gb
[3:55:09] <Xaxas115> Raul is grumpy old man the side kick

[3:55:20] <JeremyThunderStrikes> What's up Pat?
[3:55:21] <kingdudeby> Yeah. Here's hoping Obsidian can have a better future with microsoft.
[3:55:27] <Desertfishing> Radiated Mexico is better than Tucson
[3:55:36] <%ThePuddingDead> All in all, Obsidian does great work, and I got their backs, happily
[3:55:40] <DrDomVonDoom> Fix-It Raul
[3:55:45] <+TheBimbollo> @eldrich_horror only 24GB? holy shit Capcom is good at compressing their game sizes
[3:55:55] <%TeraMercier> @ThatGuyfromMars It's pretty ethical to value putting food on your family's table,
[3:56:00] <blacksoap65> @AngriestPat You think we will even see the return of the god genre(Black & White for example)
[3:56:01] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead yeah man, even tho their best writer is gone, they still have a crack team
[3:56:11] <derap41> more sister loving?
[3:56:19] <%Stratiotai2> @kingdudeby at this point I would assume Microsoft would let them do what ever they want as long as they bring people to the platform
[3:56:22] <%ThatGuyfromMars> No I'm Dirty Dave
[3:56:23] <HeadsHeldHigh> dirty goddamn dave

[3:56:53] <raven_frame> Like he doesn't dig 'em, but he has nothing against them either.
[3:56:59] <+StromkoPenguin> Once you get bought out by a company like Microsoft, best hope for the devs is to get the hell out and start a new studio with their buyout packages.
[3:57:07] <+Noxybaru> Christ, Raul.

[3:57:22] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@Idon__) (warning)
[3:57:24] <+StromkoPenguin> MS isn't any better than Electronic Arts or Ubi, they kill good studios or turn them into brainless sequel machines.

[3:57:40] <BooitsDock> TOO MUCH RAGE TO DIE
[3:57:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> a stubborn enough person can survive just about anything, rage is a hell of an anesthetic

[3:58:08] <Xaxas115> Rage is a helluv an anesthetic
[3:58:10] <%Kahnicus> @StromkoPenguin Granting that churning out sequels is inevitable under huge corporations, was Bungie better off under MS than ActiVision though?
[3:58:17] <+MiraLangsuir> Oh man, this is Danny Trejo.

[3:58:39] <%Stratiotai2> @stromkopenguin idk man, at this point I think MS will handle them better. They seem more concerned recently with good PR and pushing a developer is a touchy subject right now
[3:58:39] <%FrostMass22> @kahnicus At least under Microsoft, Halo was good
[3:58:39] <couch_potato_Ed_Boy> @TheBlackMandalorian That's pretty much what I'm getting from Pat playing New Vegas. Fallout 4 is just a severely watered version of New Vegas. if that.

[4:06:42] <%kabermano> @rumtumtugnutz Oh but Ladyboys and Traps are different i think
[4:06:49] <%ThatGuyfromMars> does pat even need to kill them? Once he got the medallion the factions reset
[4:06:53] <MildMannered_Creighton> kablooey
[4:06:55] <$SGrim> @Kahnicus he already killed Benny rooKek
[4:06:57] <+paladinstarbuster> clang
[4:06:58] <%TeraMercier> Traps aren't a category so much as a slur

[4:07:00] <%ThePuddingDead> was that a cloaca on saw on that sir?
[4:07:04] <%OwlLightningMage> @Kahnicus Pat already got that. He messed that up now LUL
[4:07:05] <derap41> Spear vs 50 cal
[4:07:06] <%ThePuddingDead> I*
[4:07:07] <%rumtumtugnutz> @kabermano You're probably right
[4:07:08] <Will9099> Gotta love the balls it takes to throw a spear at a guy with a 50 cal
[4:07:10] <%Stratiotai2> @kabermano a trap is a trap a ladyboi is a trap but much sneakier
[4:07:14] <%kabermano> @rumtumtugnutz Ladyboys have breasts from plastic surgery while traps either pad or pass as flat chested women
[4:07:14] <natebud> Give Raul a Brush gun, why not
[4:07:19] <%Kahnicus> @SGrim Oh, well I guess it'll just have to be a cleansing then
[4:07:20] <%Agami23> are legion just like the storm cloaks where no one sides with them?
[4:07:21] <PSI_Guy95> the fuck is this chat conversation
[4:07:25] <raven_frame> These guys have spears and you're coming at them with an anti-material rifle loaded with explosive ammo.
[4:07:27] <%rumtumtugnutz> LOL
[4:07:33] <%Laecerelius> Rife with VERMIN
[4:07:33] <%rumtumtugnutz> I did it!
[4:07:36] <%KevinsLunchbox> oh yeah, get Raul a banger lever action gun
[4:07:37] <%TeraMercier> It's almost unbelievable that the legion would exist with melee where everyone has a gat
[4:07:38] <%kabermano> @PSI_Guy95 We are discussing important stuff here man
[4:07:38] <derap41> @Will9099 or the ball to run at them with a lawn mover blade
[4:07:39] <%ForeverDarkness> jesus christ point blank .50 cal

[4:08:09] <+Varnarok> As long as you have more people than they have bullets, you win
[4:08:09] <natebud> They do have brush guns
[4:08:12] <James_Quivers> Bruh, balistic fists tho
[4:08:15] <dekkitout> yeah, but the ncr is the ncr
[4:08:15] <%ThatGuyfromMars> are we really having this conversation
[4:08:17] <stratfel112> I guess because the legion have the numbers
[4:08:17] <+krawtch> i always imagined these lizards run at you going HEEEEEYYYYYYY

[4:08:45] <%rumtumtugnutz> Ladyboys are legit hookers tho
[4:08:45] <Geno4344> @CircadianRhythmm you need a mod to see that I think
[4:08:47] <%kabermano> @krymzen5 Thats a meme but i think there's a genuine interesting conversation to be had there

[4:12:54] <+StromkoPenguin> @CircadianRhythmm Their track record isn't completely perfect, it could be an overambitious and interesting but flawed game. Better than FO4 but could still be bad.
[4:12:57] <%Neo_Kaiser> Who farted? Who's farting?
[4:12:58] <+Noxybaru> What was that noise?!
[4:13:01] <%kabermano> Who knew ghosts are made from mustard and WCdonalds

[4:14:10] <%Romulus1213> Cannonball!!!
[4:14:12] <derap41> Aim for the bushes
[4:14:16] <%TeraMercier> Having an engine that isn't duct taped together will provide a lot more focus time on actual content instead of wasting time on a shitty format

[4:14:30] <+Varnarok> Fuck this Mirelurk in particular
[4:14:32] <CircadianRhythmm> @stromkopenguin that's tru. I guess I just see the higher animation quality and instantly see it being better cuz bethesda's character animation has been mostly the same for so long
[4:14:35] <squirtkitten> !uptime
[4:14:35] <@Moobot> I've been playing this game for how long? Oh only 4h 14m.

[4:14:46] <%rumtumtugnutz> Thay Guillermmo Del Taco fishman sure died quick
[4:14:48] <raven_frame> For what Obsidian did in their time limit, it leads me to believe that they were sitting on their idea for New Vegas sometime beforehand.
[4:14:50] <%TeraMercier> Fuck the lakelurks
[4:14:51] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Agami23 this isn't the shape of water

[4:15:15] <%kabermano> WATER'S BACK ON THE MENU
[4:15:17] <%Jjrossman> Colorado river is fuckin great
[4:15:17] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @kiiiirsten if we counted the bodies that have fallen in our journey, we would never sleep again
[4:15:18] <+primax104> why is Pat's character named CASM?
[4:15:19] <krymzen5> how the times have changed Kappa
[4:15:20] <ShichiNoBushi> Would it only be standing water that would be or remain irradiated?
[4:15:20] <%Sovspot> hey pat, are you gonna
[4:15:21] <+Jordan_z123> Clean water in my fallout
[4:15:21] <alrobot2014> @AngriestPat that's why everyone wants the dam along with the power

[4:15:46] <bjornbjeardson> Shoulda brought power armor, even if it is kinda janky
[4:15:47] <%rumtumtugnutz> Pats character is named Patron. CASM is a mod.
[4:15:50] <squirtkitten> Climb up? You mean CLIP up Kappa
[4:15:53] <%Nobrev> @primax104 CASM is a mod that makes the game autosave much more often
[4:15:54] <+MajorBigEvil> This the T-60 armor mod?
[4:15:58] <%KevinsLunchbox> we in there now chat
[4:16:00] <+maxamillion629> You better have some stealth boys
[4:16:07] <Fujiwara_92> JUST TCL UP
[4:16:09] <%KevinsLunchbox> Raul and ED-E are deadmeat
[4:16:09] <TalisKanju> It's almost like nukes didn't completely destabilize the Mojave desert

[4:16:16] <bjornbjeardson> Pat's bouta be in the shit
[4:16:18] <dekkitout> time for a deathclaw shaped promenade
[4:16:18] <%TeraMercier> @MajorBigEvil I thought for a second too, but he doesn't add new content via mods
[4:16:19] <CircadianRhythmm> @stromkopenguin I should've done that with call of cthulu I was really hype for that and it's not that it horrible but my expectations were just to high
[4:16:20] <+dirtsniffurperson> yes hes going for the secert aromor!!
[4:16:23] <slothslayer828> ive never seen this before....
[4:16:25] <+Tiberius_Tiger> please help my balls were replaced with Spaghetti!
[4:16:27] <+StromkoPenguin> @Nobrev I think it also takes over for the normal autosave to prevent the crashes and save corruption inherent to the inbuilt system
[4:16:28] <+Varnarok> As Patron enters the canyon, 36 deathclaws all come out from one bush
[4:16:32] <%LtThunderbolt> deATH Awaits

[4:18:18] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @ThePuddingDead they were government experiments
[4:18:18] <+krawtch> deathclaws are irradiated salamanders
[4:18:22] <rockworm> I remember my first time playing this game I stumbled on this area early on lol
[4:18:26] <+Varnarok> @ThePuddingDead They are mutated Jackson's Chameleons
[4:18:29] <JohnQuickplay> @ThePuddingDead bioweapons developed before the war by the US military
[4:18:29] <%TheDude8D> uhhh why not use shotgun surgeon the whole way through
[4:18:30] <AlasterAngelo> Deathclaws are irradiated hugs given form

[4:18:33] <BakedPretzels> @thepuddingdead jacksons chameleons actually
[4:18:33] <%Sotetsu> Low ground ain't your friend.
[4:18:33] <+Kqha4000> deathclaws are chameleons
[4:18:36] <dekkitout> deathclaws are what happens when scientist have too much time with jackson chameleons
[4:18:43] <rockworm> deathclaws are really just teddy bears
[4:18:43] <%TheDude8D> anti mat so bad for deathclaws it hurts so lil
[4:18:44] <raven_frame> The Legion side of this lake is fucked.
[4:18:45] <%ThePuddingDead> Neat!
[4:18:53] <TalisKanju> @thepuddingdead They are irradiated chameleons
[4:18:55] <%Sotetsu> These guys barely do any damage. Why is that?
[4:19:05] <AlasterAngelo> because Pat is overleveled
[4:19:06] <+Varnarok> Beacuse Pat is the fucking strong
[4:19:08] <+MajorBigEvil> armor and perks

[4:20:12] <skottiesouth> Pat's always difficult
[4:20:17] <%ThePuddingDead> So wait....the US military...basically Godzilla'd a bunch of chameleons!?
[4:20:19] <+Varnarok> I personally like VATS more in FO4 where it didn't completely freeze time
[4:20:21] <Them00n> TEMPORARY BUFFS
[4:20:23] <%ThePuddingDead> That's....rad as fuck!

[4:20:50] <+InugamiTheHound> "that sucks"-Pat 2019 [crazy talk activities] kills the death claw with one bullet

[4:21:09] <daisymaisy02> Yo what is this location??
[4:21:15] <%TeraMercier> Fallout 76's real time VATS actually had some potential in concept, if you could target different body parts and it's stats didn't go nuts

[4:25:15] <raven_frame> Well you killed them Pat, you won.
[4:25:16] <+Varnarok> It's RE4 all over again. You died so hard that the game took pity on you and despawned them
[4:25:16] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat Yeah, this is where explosives win, just wallfuck up onto that outcropping right over them.
[4:25:17] <dekkitout> weird feature, but okay
[4:25:18] <GoDZooKii> I always carry few explosives to cripple their legs. Geez, Pat. Come on.

[4:25:54] <+Flambage> The armor is the bullet sponge friends you made along the way @AngriestPat
[4:25:55] <+paladinstarbuster> i want them to all spawn in behind him
[4:25:55] <Biscuitsfordays> they were GHOSTS!
[4:25:55] <+gwanzan> delicious Deathclaw eggs
[4:25:58] <alrobot2014> its supposed to be at the end of the trail of deathclaws but since those are gone i have no frame of reference
[4:25:58] <+TheChampionofBoxes> they might be in a cave
[4:26:01] <+dirtsniffurperson> its farther it the back

[4:28:23] <+eskman10> Use a automatic gun
[4:28:24] <$NocturneNovember> @AngriestPat Looking at a map now, the armor's at that northeastern most rock before that crevice
[4:28:26] <bjornbjeardson> Shotgun and use ALL the chems
[4:28:27] <%KevinsLunchbox> is pat going to silver peak mine for the remnants helmet?
[4:28:28] <%LtThunderbolt> EDE dont front, fade on sight!
[4:28:30] <+DoubleKayga> try shooting the big ones in the legs to cripple them, gives you more time to back up and shoot
[4:28:35] <Jacobgklose> He did the big fuck
[4:28:36] <+StromkoPenguin> Up close like this the shotgun is much more AP efficient and they'll be knocked back too
[4:28:38] <asurite_warrior> you got any pycho?

[4:28:50] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat your best bet is probably going to be the riot shotgun in order to knock them down.
[4:28:50] <Lurantis_> Dude you have all the money in the world, just pump chems and pay the cost to remove addictions later

[4:30:29] <+krawtch> the weak point is the underside of their nuts
[4:30:29] <slothslayer828> Endangered species
[4:30:30] <DrMoose7> so cowards can't hit them from behind
[4:30:32] <%kabermano> Thats why cats get pissed when you touch theyr bellies

[4:30:51] <+Zerodyne90> blew up his ahole
[4:30:52] <%ThatGuyfromMars> Remember the basics of fallout 4, it tells you to aim for the stomach because their skin is armored everywhere else

[4:31:28] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat armor is down in the gulley
[4:31:30] <Parapattern> Like someone ran a heard of deathclaws through a juicer
[4:31:32] <FracturedImage> hopefully your explosive rounds didnt send the armor flying
[4:31:34] <VectMachine> Is he doing the Red Lucy quest?
[4:31:35] <AlasterAngelo> first time I beat this I was high as a kite in game and armed with a super sledge
[4:31:36] <Jacobgklose> He didn’t fuck up this time SeriousSloth
[4:31:36] <asurite_warrior> What's the armor you looking for?
[4:31:37] <natebud> It's not there look elsewhere
[4:31:37] <+Varnarok> Cripple and Critical Strike prompts for days
[4:31:38] <raven_frame> So the sniper character used his sniping technique to win. Huh.
[4:31:38] <%kabermano> If you dont find it just console command it in bud
[4:31:39] <Dante_the_spooks_man> Wooo dead laws are. Extinct
[4:31:40] <dekkitout> cut to courier six walking up to vendo-tron smelling like shitted pants and deathclaw viscera
[4:31:41] <PSI_Guy95> he already did Red Lucy and her quest
[4:31:43] <%Kahnicus> hm, shoulda been right by that other loot
[4:31:51] <BeeNoons> he already did red lucy period.
[4:31:51] <%kabermano> It might be bugged after all

[4:33:10] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @TalisKanju pretty much
[4:33:12] <Desertfishing> he launched the armor
[4:33:12] <Klarrann3> Did you blow the armor away with the explosions?
[4:33:14] <%Niney_Who> You're bad at looking
[4:33:14] <%connos_livereview> no armour for you stinky

[4:33:23] <%Spydurman> look West East
[4:33:23] <%Niney_Who> Hopefully you didn't explode it into space with your Gn
[4:33:24] <thecrispyones> it probably did get blasted with the death claws LUL
[4:33:25] <+primax104> the real scare was the headphone static noise in Woolie's stream.
[4:33:26] <+TheArrow_> @MajorBigEvil oh yeah well i broke my elbows three times by sneezing
[4:33:28] <Lurantis_> Just look up the location dude
[4:33:28] <FracturedImage> thats what you get for using explosive rounds
[4:33:29] <%Tearonex> time to command console it in
[4:33:29] <alwayspronking> Pat's house is haunted. Who's talking?
[4:33:30] <+dirtsniffurperson> no power armor for your short ass
[4:33:31] <TalisKanju> @thatguyfrommars good enough for me!
[4:33:32] <st_jimmy456> @asurite_warrior he does
[4:33:32] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat at this point go wiki diving
[4:33:33] <$SirTerribleh> Where's my super suit?
[4:33:34] <derap41> it should be by the rock you looking att
[4:33:35] <AlasterAngelo> It's not actually here Pat
[4:33:35] <%Nobrev> wiki says "The armor is located in the southeast corner of the area, at the bottom of the hill in some brush, on one of two armor clad dead prospectors found laying near one another. The other corpse is wearing non-faction T-51b power armor."
[4:33:37] <+krawtch> now do it all over
[4:33:40] <adamisfruit> PAIGE! My advice is to take a hot shower! Let the warm water relax your BIG MUSCLES
[4:33:40] <+Varnarok> It says it's at the bottom of the hill near some bushes
[4:33:40] <Klarrann3> Why not use a stealth boy to sneak in and look for it
[4:33:40] <%connos_livereview> LUL
[4:33:40] <natebud> Should be on two bodies, look better
[4:33:42] <Biscuitsfordays> fell thru the world man
[4:33:43] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat go to the nest, 180 turn, down under that rock, there should be two corpses and some loot, i saw the loot earlier
[4:33:44] <%jiin6> Who's in Pain?
[4:33:44] <derap41> you might have blown it to shit
[4:33:49] <Desertfishing> explosive ammo sucks for this reason
[4:33:50] <lloyddboy> USE SHOTGUN
[4:33:52] <%ahegotrigger> its totally possible
[4:33:53] <+primax104> mod it in Pat
[4:33:54] <%Niney_Who> Southeast corner of the area apparently
[4:33:55] <haisho> In other words, BETHESDA
[4:33:56] <+MiraLangsuir> it's on two dead guys
[4:33:58] <a_mad_dragon> you were TOLD to use AP ammo
[4:33:58] <%connos_livereview> thatd be great
[4:34:02] <%Faustgesicht> blew what up?
[4:34:04] <Mnightshyamallama> I have a feeling pat just never looked where it actually is
[4:34:04] <%sshen> I had a big cold at the same time I had an inflamed gall bladder, sneezing felt like i was about to die
[4:34:05] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat also it could have spawned beneath the map. Try tcl
[4:34:06] <%ThePuddingDead> what did we say about explosive ammo dude?
[4:34:11] <%luftraumm1> near brushes
[4:34:11] <%TheDude8D> Might be a bug, reloading would of fixed it
[4:34:11] <alrobot2014> Its on a dead guy next to another dead guy
[4:34:17] <AlasterAngelo> two dead friends play
[4:34:19] <dekkitout> say what you want about fallout 4, at least important loot was in a big red box LUL
[4:34:19] <Mnightshyamallama> heads west
[4:34:20] <BigNerdSam> Just use the command console!
[4:34:20] <asurite_warrior> The armor is located in the southeast corner of the area, at the bottom of the hill in some brush, on one of two armor clad dead prospectors found laying near one another.
[4:34:25] <%Laecerelius> Maybe they glitched through the ground lol
[4:34:26] <%Magnion> @angriestpat can’t you use console man to eat t if u lost it?
[4:34:28] <%rumtumtugnutz> ***
[4:34:28] <BeeNoons> paige sneezed the bones right out
[4:34:33] <+7oasty> @Fujiwara_92 no that's cheating and pat would never cheat
[4:34:35] <+MajorBigEvil> if its not here, I authorize hacking it in
[4:34:37] <derap41> you're too far away
[4:34:37] <%VRNK> did they fall through the world when you noclipped?
[4:34:38] <+HyperRedPython> perception to low to see
[4:34:40] <+primax104> has Paige written any more lyrics for the superbeast song?
[4:34:44] <LVDoomien> @AngriestPat quoting wikia: 'Occasionally the bodies may not be present. Waiting some hours (a safe distance away and returning) can reload the map cell allowing the bodies (and the deathclaws) to appear. Clearing the cache (restart the game and hold both bumpers and the X button on Xbox or the equivalent on other platforms until "press start" is displayed) will also fix the problem, but it will cause several deathclaws to spawn as well. '
[4:34:45] <+Toast_Master_General> Old lady Paige please don't die on us, I'm sure you have 10's more years of relative health before any of that
[4:34:49] <%shadybarman> non-faction t--51b can also be found in the BOS safe house
[4:34:49] <derap41> they're where the mother was
[4:34:49] <%Kahnicus> you could just console it in, you DID earn it.... maybe buy a couple suits of power armor to rationalize the cost to repair it
[4:34:50] <+krawtch> no armor for BIG CHEATERS
[4:34:51] <%Magnion> @angriestpat I meant, can’t you use console commands to get it?
[4:34:51] <ScreamingMeat> LOST
[4:34:52] <AzureSkyKnight> Are you even where it should be?
[4:34:52] <+dirtsniffurperson> paige sneezed the power armor away lol
[4:34:53] <raven_frame> Paige would bang her own skeleton if she could.
[4:34:54] <%RageKingDomo> u might as well look it up at this point

[4:35:36] <LVDoomien> @AngriestPat more quote: 'The armor is located in the southeast corner of the area, at the bottom of the hill in some brush, on one of two armor clad dead prospectors found laying near one another. '
[4:35:38] <derap41> They should be where the deathclaw mother stood
[4:35:39] <%ThePuddingDead> dont use explosive ammo

[4:40:18] <natebud> @AngriestPat says the bodies despawning is a known bug. waiting three days and coming back might work

[4:40:43] <%RageKingDomo> oh wait check the left side
[4:40:43] <%AncelDeLambert> I have never been here EVER in all of my 8 playthroughs of this game
[4:40:45] <%ThatGuyfromMars> yeah

[4:40:55] <asurite_warrior> look in the valley nearer the river
[4:40:56] <ScreamingMeat> Just use console commands
[4:40:56] <+MechaBaphomet> Thats how mafia work
[4:40:56] <$SGrim> @AngriestPat yes, but just use /killall
[4:40:57] <+MajorBigEvil> keep searching
[4:40:58] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat If you're not gonna cheat the armor in, fast travel away, wait three days, then just noclip and kill them all, you did it legit already
[4:41:00] <natebud> @AngriestPat There's a few different solutions all involving that.
[4:41:00] <derap41> I'd reload fast travel away then come back
[4:41:03] <+timblenaut> re-do the fight
[4:41:04] <%connos_livereview> @dekkitout LUL
[4:41:06] <+Bupkis7> Add it to your inventory with console commands
[4:41:11] <%KevinsLunchbox> pat the laser rifle was there, reload the save and look around the locatiin
[4:41:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> do you want the item codes, pat
[4:41:12] <madpuppy2424> Just no clip back

[4:41:29] <+MajorBigEvil> we allow for cheating at this point
[4:41:31] <%KevinsLunchbox> god damn it
[4:41:32] <%bread_assassin> If it's for Enclave Power Armor, just do Arcade's quest.
[4:41:35] <+Varnarok> TGM
[4:41:37] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Acidshocker good to see you

[4:42:11] <st_jimmy456> we all saw
[4:42:13] <%Codemaster7777> tlb for fun and tfc for free cam
[4:42:15] <%Kahnicus> @AngriestPat could also spawn non-faction t51b and remnants armor, then buy 4 or 5 suits at the bunker to simulate repair costs
[4:42:15] <+MajorBigEvil> tgm also gives you infinite ammo so watch that
[4:42:17] <krymzen5> he did it so screw it. games cheating so should pat
[4:42:17] <derap41> worst case use base id to spawn the armor
[4:42:19] <%BlackMage66652> I SEEN IT THO
[4:42:23] <raven_frame> @haisho It's not Bethesda, it's Obsidian.
[4:42:24] <Ran196> tcl then shoot them
[4:42:24] <alrobot2014> when the game cheats you you have to cheat it back
[4:42:24] <%jiin6> We all saw the legit

[4:42:38] <+Varnarok> I don't even wanna think about how much hacking people can get up to in F76 when they don't have to pay for it
[4:42:39] <%Codemaster7777> select a thing with your mouse and type kill to kill without effort
[4:42:40] <derap41> if the game fucks up its not cheating
[4:42:42] <Basch71> you have to cheat to beat todd howard's game Kappa
[4:42:42] <Dozale> To disable god mode = TPM
[4:42:43] <%Romulus1213> we saw you do it pat
[4:42:47] <%TeraMercier> @raven_frame It's Bethesda's shitty barely pulled from gen to gen engine
[4:42:47] <%KevinsLunchbox> we saw the laser rifle where the bodies sit, the means the body was somewhere
[4:42:49] <ScreamingMeat> Helmets near James Town tho
[4:42:54] <%KevinsLunchbox> but pat listens to retard chat and left

[4:43:21] <haisho> @raven_frame Isn't it still on a Bethesda engine?
[4:43:23] <+Extrallent> Wait here while I go be a god for 5 minutes

[5:23:43] <ShichiNoBushi> If you want to complain about the US drinking age being 21, you'd have to do so to Moms Against Drunk Driving.

[5:24:19] <leinadtonu> Well that's what makes you funny...
[5:24:19] <+cereal_box_conspiracy> It was actually Lupus.
[5:24:19] <%TeraMercier> Paige was the House the whole time
[5:24:20] <ShichiNoBushi> She can't be on House because it's never lupus.
[5:24:23] <+bonelord> It's NOT Lupus.
