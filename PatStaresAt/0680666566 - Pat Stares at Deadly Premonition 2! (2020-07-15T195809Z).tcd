[0:12:25] <+dark_kebabs> @patstaresat have you seen Swerys apology for the transgender depiction in dp2?
[0:12:27] <BoneofMalkav> That's a creature I would expect from a Fallout New Vegas Monster Pack Mod

[0:13:56] <Blunder_Blue> Like it's still fucked up but considering this is the deep south...
[0:13:57] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> @PatStaresAt I heard it was a culture thing, where in japan deadnaming isn't a deal since they see it as who they were.
[0:13:57] <%swesterly> It’s pretty chill of him to admit wrong and promise to fix it
[0:13:58] <%shurtal> 90%

[0:14:52] <%Fien111> @Ominnous Trans character getting called by their pre-transition name, which is a HUGE no-no in the community and used to demean them a lot
[0:14:58] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> What does Pat Stare At when he is falling asleep?
[0:14:58] <%CappuccinoGuil> Stop trying so hard, Camera, you got this
[0:14:59] <@SoFarFetched> @CappuccinoGuil well it's more of their reasoning when I was looking was "Swery why are you bending your back for these people,you don't need to for these sensitive people"
[0:15:00] <nomolomo> look at the emlo
[0:15:04] <nomolomo> perfect boi
[0:15:04] <%swesterly> Although bad trans politics aside there are some...questionable moments in the game so far. Mild sexism/racism.

[0:16:29] <$autcetera> Yeah the Japanese understanding of gender fluidity is so much different, they start with a totally separate deck of cards
[0:16:34] <+ATentacleMonster> @Nekros4442 Wasn't implied in the slightest.

[0:45:56] <1BeatGames> What a fuck
[0:45:56] <digaogrunge> SKIP MORE STONES
[0:45:56] <%Fien111> York is a total heel
[0:45:56] <+xeros720> york gives no shits
[0:45:58] <%DetroitSentai> she would be in more danger going with him
[0:46:01] <%Emperor_Machinus> York is the evil of the world
[0:46:01] <%Movemeister> Protecting her from diabeetus
[0:46:04] <+RadDude6969> :p
[0:46:05] <ミュウレ4242> if they wrote penny gadget in the 90s, she'd be patti.
[0:46:08] <morningmoondude> York: I will mamoru you. Except for now tho, go home.
[0:46:09] <%shurtal> Pat Didn't Tweet going Live Again
[0:46:10] <+typo114> Stern hand here HahaShrugLeft HahaReindeer
[0:46:12] <ArcOfDeath> the red seeds really make it
[0:46:13] <+ppangboi> seems on brand for York
[0:46:18] <%Fien111> Murder is boring, SKULL NO ONE ELSE CAN SEE!
[0:46:21] <olaksi> Contractually obligate to mamoru Patti
[0:46:22] <MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> Why would you investigate that?
[0:46:23] <TastySammiches> PogChamp skipping rocks
[0:46:25] <sgtlaggy> the murder scene isn't going anywhere
[0:46:26] <%mighty_max_t> bad
[0:46:26] <ranarath> Only the magic shit is important
[0:46:27] <+Flasktoss> bad cool cool good bad bad
[0:46:27] <%dukenux> BAD
[0:46:27] <+RadDude6969> what murder sire
[0:46:29] <%PettyFunk> What's with this Spielberg guy's movie poster by the death altar? Very suspicious.
[0:46:30] <kiwicoffin> He literally says that kind of crime scene investigating is useless
[0:46:31] <Ipsenscastle> If Patti gets murdered as a result of York's shitbird behaviour, that's genuinely excellent writing
[0:46:33] <%ShichiNoBushi> Great! Amazing! Fantastic!
[0:46:40] <+mckraven> cool stone skipping brah
[0:46:45] <1BeatGames> Ate her sundae, promised to protect her, and told her that she'd be good on her own 🤦🏿♂️
[0:46:46] <kiwicoffin> You're following clues from a Voodoo mirage
[0:46:53] <%spiritofmojave> BAD
[0:46:54] <+Taglog7> mamoru me yah bitch
[0:47:01] <+xeros720> the timing is mystifying
[0:47:03] <reonome> you just suck pat
[0:47:03] <%DashXero> Wouldn't you usually need a steady frame rate for something like this?
[0:47:06] <%kiiiirsten> @1BeatGames truuuu
[0:47:09] <+ppangboi> COOL COOL GOOD BAD GOOD BAD BAD
[0:47:20] <1BeatGames> Pat, you need to SPEEN the rock
[0:47:21] <%toastybites> BAD
[0:47:24] <audrus> they want perfect timing bruh
[0:47:25] <Onamar> When the circle flashes blue
[0:47:29] <%WhereIsWill> GUNTRICKSWORD
[0:47:30] <+HotBloodedHero> Use the rings to time it, not the water
[0:47:31] <%DetroitSentai> right before it turns yellow
[0:47:32] <TastySammiches> delicious lizard skin
[0:47:32] <ミュウレ4242> with the rythem inside you, you don't need frames.
[0:47:34] <psimon_> I kinda love the music in this game
[0:47:35] <%clockworknate> right before it hits
[0:47:36] <kiwicoffin> try using the same rock
[0:47:40] <%pectusumbra> Okay but seriously DP vs. Disco Elysium. I can't be the only one that sees the similarity in weirdo cops using nonsense to solve crime right?
[0:47:43] <+xeros720> fuck, you get crafting items at high scores
[0:47:49] <TastySammiches> I think you want the ring as small as possible without closing
[0:47:52] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Cool is basically ASAP after Bad, still kinda big
[0:47:56] <%NeoCre> When the circle is SMALL Pat
[0:47:56] <%WhereIsWill> just feel the vibes pat
[0:47:57] <%Rabbi_Hyman_Krustofsky> CHrist this literally just feels like a less good Persona rather than a sequel to the original game
[0:48:02] <reonome> SourPls
[0:48:02] <psimon_> feel the frames
[0:48:03] <TikanZK> BAD
[0:48:03] <Nendroid> york definitely has a bunch of levels in inland empire
[0:48:07] <%toastybites> circle size
[0:48:11] <%Treuan> I'm sure the Framerate isn't helping
[0:48:11] <Craizyshy_ry> When the circle closes
[0:48:15] <+PortableBoredom> Have you even thrown a rock, c'mon dude
[0:48:18] <+ppangboi> too much Inland Empire even
[0:48:19] <%bigboyeggo> ????
[0:48:21] <tranquilturnip> was that english or
[0:48:21] <coracor> ??
[0:48:28] <TastySammiches> york has nearly maxxed inland empire
[0:48:29] <ArcOfDeath> Conjurer doll
[0:48:29] <%RufusJuice> @PatStaresAt Cool is when the circle is as small as possible
[0:48:31] <MaSterChiEfin420blntNinjA> That seems wrong
[0:48:31] <+toastybites> wtf was that description LUL
[0:48:33] <%WhereIsWill> DONT LOSE YOUR WAY
[0:48:36] <Profmcstevie> He speaks in the language of gods
[0:48:36] <kiwicoffin> that sounds like the wrong way to explain it
[0:48:37] <DSD24> @pectusumbra someone made a comment that York maxes out his Inland Empire stat
[0:48:38] <+xeros720> at least total score is what's giving him things
[0:48:43] <TikanZK> this minigame is very poggers
[0:48:45] <audrus> skip rocks to learn voodoo, can you feel it zach, the deep south
[0:48:51] <%spiritofmojave> PogChamp
[0:48:53] <+ATentacleMonster> hell yeah
[0:48:55] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> from WHERE
[0:49:00] <TastySammiches> york's inland empire stat doesnt max out until the end of DP1
[0:49:02] <+Remery_> the hypest gameplay on Twitch
[0:49:03] <%swesterly> @dsd24 that is a perfect description of York
[0:49:04] <%NopeBadguy> It looks like Cool is right as the stone touches the surface?
[0:49:06] <TastySammiches> but it is very high
[0:49:07] <Craizyshy_ry> Riiiiight as it hits the water
[0:49:10] <Craizyshy_ry> Think mario
[0:49:11] <candidateplays> York 100%ed Inland Empire, Blue Velvet and Eraserhead. Still working on Twin Peaks.
[0:49:13] <%clockworknate> Think of it like you are edging and trying not to pop
[0:49:14] <%spiritofmojave> who's giving you these rewards yeah LUL
[0:49:15] <+vexion_smh> LUL
[0:49:18] <%PettyFunk> It was chilling in the river. A true southern delight.
[0:49:18] <+mckraven> @rabbi_hyman_krustofsky feels very similar to the original to me
[0:49:20] <Ace_Flibble> Just git gud, duh.
[0:49:24] <%shurtal> Pat's last chance to Tweet about going live
[0:49:25] <%sashagreenspiderqueen> LUL

[0:49:39] <+ppangboi> but how is York's Shivers?
[0:49:39] <+vexion_smh> Shoot it across the river LUL

[0:50:20] <%shurtal> Third time in a week i've reminded him

[0:59:04] <%StaceMcGate> "framerate dimension"
[0:59:04] <%StarlingSilence> lmao
[0:59:04] <snowmanse> This sounds like the Silent Hill Downpour theme
[0:59:05] <+king_of_beggars> Do you think there's a guy like York working for the IRS? Just encountering supernatural tax dodgers?
[0:59:06] <3viltiki> Whose stand is this?!
[0:59:06] <%erohoney> it almost doesn't feel right
[0:59:07] <%VHGS> found a portal to the frames dimension lmao

[0:59:23] <stabbityrabbit> Wait, so is this game really loading the entire overworld at once?
[0:59:25] <%Fien111> It'd be hilarious if the game suddenly jumped to INSANE 4K graphics and the highest quality shadows and models for a single in-game cutscene for no reason before switching back to this without a word

[1:17:06] <%weissguard> @SolidusRex You start the chant Liono does, and see if he flinches.
[1:17:09] <BoneofMalkav> @Sol Drop kick em like in Maximum Action
[1:17:16] <delta0093> so how long is this game meant to be?
[1:17:30] <MrPedrovsky> WE WUZ SNARF N SHIET
[1:17:30] <ChrisM341> Snarf Souls PogChamp
[1:17:34] <%bigdumbidiotguy> someone should mod this game so that all the enemy noises are just farts
[1:17:36] <%PulverKong> I want to shoot myself when I hear Snarf "talk" on thundercats
[1:17:39] <Craizyshy_ry> i mean if i was trying to cut a fbi agent’s balls off and he shot me with a rubber bullet, id probably yell snarf too
[1:17:41] <%CommanderSqueaks> @SolidusRex I slap his ass with even more SNAARF that him, beat him at his own game.
[1:18:05] <%PulverKong> Snarf was uWu before uWu
[1:18:25] <Craizyshy_ry> Snarf or Narf?
[1:18:27] <star_feline> why are the bullets made of rubber?
[1:18:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> I was about to say it's probably just reversed audio, but that means they're yelling FRAAANS, which makes less sense.
[1:18:38] <MrPedrovsky> 3DSNARFD
[1:18:38] <%CommanderSqueaks> Unless there's a character name Frans who is intregral to this case?
[1:18:44] <%kiiiirsten> @star_feline To stun alligators

[1:18:59] <%bigboyeggo> snarfposting must become the hip new meme before sundown
[1:19:06] <Craizyshy_ry> Dont kill the squirrels.... just maim them
[1:19:08] <MrPedrovsky> Is Pat Snarfing Paige right now?????
[1:19:13] <ranarath> @CommanderSqueaks That realization just made it better. LUL
[1:19:16] <Footlooseatm2> 1000 SNARFs under the sea.
[1:19:17] <%PettyFunk> It's probably supposed to be some variation of their "snip snip snip" thing but drawn out into a weird death cry. SNARF
[1:19:17] <%weissguard> To err is human. To SNARRRF is divine.
[1:19:18] <%PulverKong> Frans is agermanspy, he guested dark souls streams a couple times
[1:19:21] <%shurtal> to quote chumbawumba Pat's "PIssing the night away" right now
[1:19:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm calling it, the audio is reversed and they're actually saying Frans, who is an integral part of this case.
[1:19:23] <Craizyshy_ry> Snyes
[1:19:35] <olaksi> Is he taking a shower again?
[1:19:36] <%spiritofmojave> Snarf posting will live and die tonight

[1:19:44] <Craizyshy_ry> Frans is the name of the fashionable woman

[1:20:22] <%bigboyeggo> @KubaK8989 the mods will have to make a SNARF megathread to contain all the snarfing
[1:20:24] <Craizyshy_ry> Btw i was making shit up

[1:21:53] <star_feline> He's pooping and peeing and snarfing right now
[1:22:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @OwlLightningMage Isn't that just littering?
[1:22:02] <%PettyFunk> Snarf may have some relation to Captain Cold, AKA Snart. I'm anticipating a DC Comics crossover in DP2.
[1:22:07] <%bigboyeggo> @CommanderSqueaks Snarftey First
[1:22:11] <delta0093> from watching the star trek streams pat seems to take like 45 mins to take a dump

[1:22:16] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave Get things going with an insane drum solo.
[1:22:20] <Craizyshy_ry> Anyone timing how long this Snarf break is?
[1:22:36] <+OwlLightningMage> Pat is hitting the back right now
[1:22:39] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat so cold blooded he can watch a girl get dismembered and then go and snarf.
[1:22:41] <MrPedrovsky> Hey Guuurl~ You got a nice SNARF right there
[1:22:44] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard The only acceptable mood setter fr LUL
[1:22:48] <+Yokuho> Do you guys think he still holds the toilet paper with his hand while pissing?
[1:22:49] <olaksi> Legally if he doesn't come back in 15 minutes we are allowed to leave
[1:22:53] <%Stonebeard> One shouldn't ask how long Pat snarfs, instead one should ask why he snarfs
[1:23:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> I don't know what this sex thing all of you are talking about, we only SNARF in this household.
[1:23:10] <%Rain_Mage> And our homework is cancelled
[1:23:10] <Craizyshy_ry> Rip and Snarf... until it is done
[1:23:15] <Footlooseatm2> Willy Wonka and the SNARF factory.

[1:44:59] <olaksi> Back to artistic FPS
[1:44:59] <%PulverKong> after a 5 minute load
[1:45:01] <%logoth_> There was framerate here. It's gone now.
[1:45:02] <$autcetera> @mule4242 mostly I agree, it's the way things are presented. people with no critical backbone just take the packaging of a message without thinking of what's inside
[1:45:03] <%bigboyeggo> did the audio just get fucky for anyone else?
[1:45:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> Occasionally this game gives you some frames, as a treat.
[1:45:05] <thelonechris> There was a frame here, it's gone now
[1:45:05] <Kingjoker310> my framies
[1:45:06] <CursedNobleman> there was a framerate here. its gone now.
[1:45:06] <amonimis> framerate patch when

[1:45:09] <tranquilturnip> wouyld you ever restream DP1?
[1:45:09] <OtterExpress> We'll never see another frame ever ever
[1:45:09] <dexdestroyazz> THere was framerate here, It's gone now...
[1:45:10] <%bread_assassin> There were frames here, but they're gone now.
[1:45:10] <%RueOrin> You have a choice. Framerate PR skateboard
[1:45:10] <%toolofparanoia> Back to absurdly long load times
[1:45:10] <%dukenux> maybe he turns around
[1:45:11] <%Typhaeon> Well, I hope SWERY leaves the scene with Melvin intact, we'll see what comes later though
[1:45:14] <Paperware> We never had any framerate, frames are just a myth
[1:45:14] <RetributionP> there were frames here.. it's gone now
[1:45:14] <star_feline> there was some frames here, it's gone now
[1:45:18] <%TalisKanju> There was good framerate here. It's gone now.
[1:45:19] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> there were frames here. they're gone now.
[1:45:19] <%CommanderSqueaks> The audio engineer for this game needs to go back to school.
[1:45:20] <SirDogBear> you need low frame rate to have the authentic Louisiana experience
[1:45:20] <Coystick> Fucky wucky
[1:45:20] <%clockworknate> @PatStaresAt Couldnt york rent a car?
[1:45:21] <%bigboyeggo> not the game, you
[1:45:23] <WeltSchulter> the snarfs were the only things keeping the frame machine going

[1:45:34] <%Livelinne> psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand psaCrazyhand
[1:45:35] <%Dementedpenguin> Fuck cars.
[1:45:35] <%Emperor_Machinus> there was a frame rate here. It's gone now
[1:45:36] <SchroedingersFerret> Frame rate probably dies because the game is trying to keep track of character positions or something.
[1:45:36] <OtterExpress> I mean thats just a series staple as having weird audio
[1:45:37] <+CrimsonAscend> We believe in you frame rate
[1:45:37] <%joylent_blue> ok phew
[1:45:37] <missingangle> but that'd be logical, fuck that
[1:45:38] <TastySammiches> he likes the skateboard
[1:45:38] <%dukenux> Can't you call the Dorifto lady?
[1:45:39] <sonofslann> POG?!

[1:45:40] <+KoryMccool> AH YES
[1:45:40] <RagingLeo> I wanna hear Life is Beautiful in this at some point
[1:45:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> York WANTS to ride that skateboard
[1:45:41] <Ell1ot> but skateboard
[1:45:41] <delta0093> skateboard > car
[1:45:42] <%dukenux> OOF
[1:45:42] <star_feline> Here we goooo
[1:45:42] <Gamer76255> A car would probably kill the game though
[1:45:43] <ppararaj> my eyes
[1:45:43] <Craizyshy_ry> Currently removing the frames, please hold
[1:45:43] <+KoryMccool> FRAMES
[1:45:44] <+xeros720> there's no in game justification for no car and no gun?
[1:45:44] <CursedNobleman> Man, this game runs like sysiphus up a ramp.
[1:45:45] <TrashbagZombie> He did. It got replaced with the skateboard
[1:45:45] <Ipsenscastle> Why can't York do a nosebone
[1:45:46] <%dukenux> that cronchy framerate
[1:45:46] <%toolofparanoia> Pat, this game hasn't crahed yet has it?
[1:45:49] <+cvp5127> back to crunchy fps
[1:45:50] <Tha_Mik> Oh yeah
[1:45:50] <%spiritofmojave> He just likes to be a skater boy
[1:45:51] <notquitedead123> What does he need a car for if he has a skateboard?
[1:45:51] <+ConfusedEX> Cinematic
[1:45:53] <%TalisKanju> There were more frames here. They're gone now.
[1:45:54] <TastySammiches> brrrrrrr
[1:45:54] <MrDoomtastic44> ah, the best open world

[1:45:56] <%PulverKong> bye frames
[1:45:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> @RagingLeo He sometimes whistles it while you're skateboarding
[1:46:00] <star_feline> Do a kickflip!
[1:46:00] <%taku_toots> but the olies
[1:46:01] <PinkuLiite> It's a feature. : ^)
[1:46:02] <%ssjklyco> The police station gave him access to cars in the first game because he crashed his car.
[1:46:02] <ChrisM341> York Hawk Existential Nightmare
[1:46:03] <%honeyman18> imagine this at a solid 30 fps
[1:46:04] <%UvBenServed> skateboard go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[1:46:05] <OtterExpress> Fare ye well framerate we hardly knew ye
[1:46:05] <ミュウレ4242> york already rented a car, but it was stolen by squirrels.
[1:46:06] <%dukenux> man, this feels so bad, going back from that smooth framerate LUL
[1:46:06] <%yves_is_online> this game is incredible
[1:46:06] <%joylent_blue> SO HERE I AM
[1:46:07] <UndeadManatee> patch the first game to give york sick skateboard skills
[1:46:09] <Shwepie> Even if he could Pat wouldn't because renting a car would cost money and a skateboard is free.
[1:46:09] <@SoFarFetched> There's an uber thing in this game,but Pat has yet to use it.
[1:46:11] <Craizyshy_ry> Ok! Who’s ready for some therapy?
[1:46:13] <%EldritchBee> EldritchBee subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months! Hey pat! Have you ever been asked/considered playing Hylics 1 and 2? Great little surrealist indie RPGs that you could knock out in a couple streams. YOu may not like em because they're very artsy but they're some real fun indie RPGs.
[1:46:14] <DrFuzzyPanda> My headache has magically returned. Thanks DP2 LUL
[1:46:14] <ExpressNode> He can even make the frames go snarf
[1:46:14] <%PulverKong> he only has 4 of these stories and he NEVER SHUTS UP
[1:46:14] <missingangle> smh, can't believe York doesn't use heelies to swerve around town
[1:46:14] <%RueOrin> Can you imagine being York's boss reading his case reports?
[1:46:15] <%weissguard> @spiritofmojave He said to YOU, later boi. Kappa
[1:46:16] <%Nobrev> he did rent a car but it got stolen

[1:46:25] <%Dakuu75> DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
[1:46:27] <Ipsenscastle> I wish York could bail super hard
[1:46:28] <tranquilturnip> New Orleans was built in the calculatably worst place ever
[1:46:28] <+OwlLightningMage> This game does have Uber
[1:46:28] <%toolofparanoia> Goddammit york get some new dialoge
[1:46:29] <balquisa> it turned into a mobile game

[1:46:35] <%UvBenServed> LUL
[1:46:36] <UndeadManatee> it was a mistake to remove the talk button
[1:46:36] <Tha_Mik> Whens heelies dlc
[1:46:36] <BluBox> Soap shoes
[1:46:36] <Profmcstevie> Pat "I love York man" also pat "York SHADDUP"
[1:46:37] <%StarlingSilence> looooool
[1:46:37] <%NeoCre> *Snarfs dying* you don’t understand, I was holding the bad frame rate BACK
[1:46:37] <thelonechris> He should have had Soaps
[1:46:38] <missingangle> I know RIGHT?
[1:46:38] <%DappercatEsquire> DP3, you get a pogo stick
[1:46:40] <%joylent_blue> oh god i wanted heelies so bad
[1:46:40] <notquitedead123> I love the parts between the load screens best.
[1:46:42] <%Paperware> Paperware subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
[1:46:44] <samura1_queen19> Frame rate is bonkers
[1:46:44] <%rdark_ksu> hear York defend the use of heelies would be fucking hilarious
[1:46:45] <%dukenux> York would absolutely be the person to use heelies
[1:46:47] <%spiritofmojave> @weissguard Avril Lavinge needs to replace the OST every so often
[1:46:48] <TrashbagZombie> Were they around in 2005?
[1:46:49] <%bigboyeggo> YEEEAAHH
[1:46:49] <%Dakuu75> what about a Razor Scooter
[1:46:52] <+ATentacleMonster> That's brilliant
[1:46:56] <%Livelinne> LUL
[1:46:56] <%WhereIsWill> get him some SOAP shoes yeyeye
[1:46:57] <+KoryMccool> "quick movement boots"
[1:46:57] <%toolofparanoia> York is a trendsetter
[1:46:57] <ppararaj> If its 98 they shoes will light up
[1:46:58] <tranquilturnip> PSYCHO HEELIES
[1:46:58] <+Jonesman64> They'll be secret FBI tech
[1:46:58] <%CommanderSqueaks> And it'll ACTUALLY involve a brand deal with whomever owns Heelies
[1:47:01] <Ipsenscastle> I vote Space Hopper for DP3
[1:47:01] <theMeNiNBlack6> And york will till oss all about them
[1:47:03] <%StarlingSilence> i want that so bad
[1:47:06] <%spiritofmojave> Have York invent Heelies LUL
[1:47:07] <sonofslann> You zoomers and you’re obsession with frames
[1:47:08] <jadedtower> "Zach, I believe these heelies are a wise investment, they are both roller skates and shoes. How woderful!"
[1:47:08] <%yves_is_online> this games audio mixing is nothing short of bizarre
[1:47:09] <ExpressNode> DP3 will be 4k but at 15 FPS
[1:47:20] <DSD24> This case can go FUCK itself
[1:47:20] <OtterExpress> Pogo Stick in DP3
[1:47:22] <@SoFarFetched> If York had a scooter,he'd have to take a random skill check on whether or not he bashes his knee with the scooter.
[1:47:22] <+king_of_beggars> There were skates with retractable wheels since the 80's, yo. "Heelies" are just those but without the front wheels.
[1:47:23] <%Maids4lyfe> Swery then says he never watched a PatStaresAt stream when DP3 comes out
[1:47:23] <%dukenux> I love those wall conspiracy boards
[1:47:23] <%Fien111> "This is amazing, Zach! THe pinnacle of transportation in this fine American Century!"
[1:47:25] <NEOFilly> "PSYCHO HEELIES" like... wheels on york's skeleton heels?
[1:47:27] <%Noelle_of_the_Nova> On the deadname thing, its a cultural thing. I totally understand the idea of a transperson's dead name being used to refer to themselves in the past. Hell, I do something like that sometimes. So calm down chat
[1:47:31] <%CommanderSqueaks> Kojima gets Under Armor and Monster brand deals, SWERY gets fucking Heelies.
[1:47:32] <balquisa> the way of the future the way of the future the way of the future
[1:47:33] <Tech0070> DP3 will be modern day with hover boards
[1:47:34] <Footlooseatm2> I want to go on this journey with Pat but... SNARF is just killing me.
[1:47:35] <%PulverKong> he does a bit like Mulder

[1:49:41] <shatteredglass4> I now understand why Canadians are insulted by are lack of knowledge of their geography
[1:49:41] <Craizyshy_ry> More east then south
[1:49:41] <+SH1NK1R0> I live in fl. Pat is right. Floridians do not predominantly have accents. Im from pr btw
[1:49:42] <Footlooseatm2> Floor bitch.
[1:49:46] <+attackofthesage> @KoryMccool probably
[1:49:46] <TrashbagZombie> When you're canadian, all of the states are south
[1:49:46] <%Typhaeon> The Fourth David D:
[1:49:49] <%arancet> north of Orlando is "south" in FL, Orlando and below is more northern accent

[1:49:54] <Meekest> Is it???
[1:49:56] <ミュウレ4242> canadians can still appreciate the weirdness of isolated french colonies like louisianna.
[1:50:02] <+attackofthesage> Floridians don't have accents that often. That is true
[1:50:03] <Footlooseatm2> Ummm...
[1:50:03] <%PulverKong> i bet we can find ONE
[1:50:03] <+mckraven> Northern Florida is more related to Alabama and Georgia than it is the rest of Florida
[1:50:04] <%bigboyeggo> that doesn't sound correct
[1:50:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> @dukenux Don't give Pat an out on this
[1:50:05] <%Deadpal> that is not true...
[1:50:05] <star_feline> is taht true?
[1:50:06] <+DinnerCalzone> I find that hard to believe
[1:50:06] <notquitedead123> Sounds like bullshit
[1:50:07] <olaksi> I wonder if that's true
[1:50:09] <%SilverDevilfish> I doubt that

[1:50:10] <+KoryMccool> @CommanderSqueaks no you need to say no
[1:50:10] <TastySammiches> I heavily doubt that

[1:50:11] <+G_Thunders> @arancet exactly
[1:50:11] <%tigerfang86> wait what
[1:50:12] <balquisa> north and central florida is south, South Florida is retirees, spring breakers, and Latinos
[1:50:13] <%Deadpal> That is legitimately not true at all.
[1:50:13] <%Dakuu75> I doubt that
[1:50:13] <UndeadManatee> it is true

[1:50:43] <TheSinner42> Slender man almost got one
[1:50:43] <%Agami23> this is waaaay better than the profiling system of DP1
[1:50:44] <%indig0bird> It's probably true and murders tend to be for other reasons

[1:50:51] <unclekulikov> WAAAAT
[1:50:52] <missingangle> I wonder if R stands for Red...

[1:51:23] <+OwlLightningMage> Swery is an Ameribu like Kojima
[1:51:24] <Shwepie> York: Let's relax and wait for backseating to guide us.
[1:51:27] <%pectusumbra> You might say he's a romantic?
[1:51:28] <UndeadManatee> york loves everywhere he does though

[1:51:29] <+Taglog7> does york like country music?
[1:51:29] <+RowenCleric> didnt york say the same thing about the north west

[1:52:05] <%Jumpie8> is Paige a Southern Belle?
[1:52:05] <%indig0bird> Fuck this case tho
[1:52:07] <ChrisM341> York is a son of Sparda Kappa
[1:52:10] <%TalisKanju> Maybe Pat thought Florida is only for retirees from New York
[1:52:12] <%JVolfram> York is what I would describe as positive to a fault
[1:52:15] <Craizyshy_ry> Every day im snarferin’
[1:52:20] <+truehippy> Ritual killings perpetrated by individuals or small groups within a society that denounces them as simple murder are difficult to classify as either "human sacrifice" or mere pathological homicide because they lack the societal integration of sacrifice proper
[1:52:21] <kiwicoffin> I'd have a good attitude piloting someone else's body

[2:09:07] <%KaiserMario> She's dead, what's the difference in finding the body before, or after?
[2:09:08] <pootybutt1> I like how Simon talks like he himself knows he sucks and that noone wants to hear him speak
[2:09:08] <%honeyman18> How is no one talking about him referring to himself in the plural?
[2:09:12] <%CommanderSqueaks> He's been smoking that blunt for like an hour now hasn't he?
[2:09:12] <Huntercd> Should Zach be smoking?
[2:09:12] <%rumtumtugnutz> What if Brain Cancer Zach isn't real?
[2:09:14] <%PulverKong> James Earl Jones?

[2:18:19] <%possumwalsh1221> Zach the type of dude that gets actual info out of every conversation he has

[2:18:27] <%dukenux> Hacking twitter accounts to extort bitcoin...
[2:18:32] <%ConLin_Arts_> THATS HOW FBI WORKS
[2:18:38] <%PettyFunk> The coarser coffee is ground, the more watery the flavor will be, so you'd think he would want more grounds to account for that.

[3:20:59] <+Merhabi> The game runs so shit it can not drop the bit rate
[3:21:04] <OtterExpress> Fun fact: apparently when your pets dream they're usually dreaming of you because they love you
[3:21:07] <+chunkymonkey737> imagine if there's a framerate powerup
[3:21:10] <%joylent_blue> skateboard POWER lytMOTIVATED

[3:36:02] <%CommanderSqueaks> CURVE
[3:36:03] <%possumwalsh1221> You’re on the right track
[3:36:04] <astrophizz> lighter ball
[3:36:05] <startstoprepeat> feel like you'd have a better chance from the right
[3:36:06] <%DetroitSentai> you have the right idea
[3:36:06] <+Awestonio> I needed like 100 attempt s, no joke
[3:36:06] <FiftyFiveP> need CURVE
[3:36:09] <amonimis> lighter ball, more spin

[3:36:10] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt RIght idea

[3:45:59] <%Niney_Who> HE'S GONNA SHIT
[3:45:59] <%Metballs> Pat, just walk down the lane and do it close range
[3:46:00] <+Merhabi> you keep almost doing it but
[3:46:01] <%dukenux> i think it's easier to curve lighter ball?
[3:46:03] <+ballzxxtoxxyou> Do it from the far right and curve it left
[3:46:03] <+zigzagreus> hey you got 1, nice job
[3:46:04] <BluBox> FAILURE
[3:46:06] <%JerredTheAndal> MARK IT ZERO
[3:46:07] <%Niney_Who> RAGESHIT
[3:46:07] <Them00n> This is worse than the shadow puzzle.
[3:46:10] <iheatthis12> Just shoot the pins with you gun
[3:46:10] <%heartlesshealer> no bigger, just better
[3:46:15] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[3:46:15] <+HotBloodedHero> Hmm Pat rubs his nose even when it's not a successful move
[3:46:15] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> scoot all the way right and curve barely left
[3:46:16] <%CappuccinoGuil> Lighter = easier to turn
[3:46:17] <OtterExpress> just pull out your fukin gun
[3:46:17] <%GarbageQueenEllie> nice
[3:46:18] <mrlastchance1> Isn't there like a crime to be solved?
[3:46:18] <%possumwalsh1221> I looked up how on YouTube and still couldn’t do it LUL
[3:46:19] <%Captain_Doomsday> FACE IT STRAIGHT!
[3:46:21] <+G_Thunders> What’s the reward four this
[3:46:22] <usurper_sos> Just don't make it small 4Head
[3:46:22] <%heartlesshealer> never bigger
[3:46:22] <chhdez> Hit middle
[3:46:23] <+lazysaiyajin> less streght?
[3:46:25] <%swesterly> Chat how much money has he spent on this
[3:46:25] <Pnutz409> He needs to channel his inner kingpin
[3:46:27] <StrawberryTofu1> f a i l u r e
[3:46:30] <%Captain_Doomsday> TRIUMPH OR DIE!
[3:46:30] <+Merhabi> ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper ResidentSleeper
[3:46:31] <%doc_ock_rokc> @Them00n Nothing was worse then shadow puzzle
[3:46:35] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> oh yeah didn't know you could turn it
[3:46:38] <3viltiki> Faster doesn't mean better either
[3:46:38] <StormingRLP> You probs don't need too much power so that the ball doesn't carry the pin all the way with it.
[3:46:41] <psimon_> he doesnt know how curving works NotLikeThis
[3:46:42] <%heartlesshealer> too much curve
[3:46:43] <%Garthunox> go all the way to the left, aim the angle to the right and left spin at max
[3:46:44] <+Slamantha> just run up to the pins and suplex them
[3:46:44] <%toastybites> holy shit
[3:46:45] <+lazysaiyajin> clip this
[3:46:46] <%CappuccinoGuil> Good idea, tho
[3:46:46] <+inopss> Reward is a gun sticker

[3:46:56] <%CommanderSqueaks> It will never be the same, chat
[3:46:57] <SJK300> I bet Paige could hit this shot on first try Kappa

[3:47:17] <MattDemers> I like how it's not $2.50, but $2.5
[3:47:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Give Elmo the controller
[3:47:18] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> yeyeyyeyeyeyeyee
[3:47:22] <+Merhabi> go for actual medium not medium high
[3:47:26] <%CommanderSqueaks> LUL
[3:47:27] <Them00n> You want to hit the pin with a strong curve to make it fly to the opposite side.
[3:47:28] <%joylent_blue> almost
[3:47:28] <%heartlesshealer> I super wish I could send Pat an MSPaint picture showing how momentum works with bowling balls
[3:47:29] <amonimis> less power
[3:47:31] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> that's the direction you need
[3:47:32] <%Dakuu75> Tokyo Drift it

[3:47:55] <usurper_sos> Foolishness
[3:47:55] <%SirGO0SE> @heartlesshealer you might have enough time to LUL
[3:47:55] <%swesterly> I’ve been a fool to myself
[3:47:55] <%GarbageQueenEllie> You should throw all the balls at once
[3:47:56] <%Niney_Who> Speeeeen
[3:47:56] <OtterExpress> Francic Mork Yorgan: pro bowler
[3:47:58] <%dukenux> SPIN FOR WIN
[3:48:01] <star_feline> How much did pat waste on bowling?
[3:48:04] <%SpicyVibration> backseat bowling is great
[3:48:04] <%Metballs> Max power, heaviest ball, just load a cannon, it's the only way
[3:48:04] <ranarath> I like that he pays $2.5 each time, not $2.50. LUL
[3:48:04] <%joylent_blue> yeah ShinobiPhoenix
[3:48:05] <%Chichen> pat horse
[3:48:05] <+Merhabi> pat left was treating you so well
[3:48:09] <%bigboyeggo> pat is getting redder by the second
[3:48:10] <%walternatorz> is pat secretly a horse?
[3:48:11] <Giztech> what about half power with 3/4 spin? from left to right?
[3:48:12] <%heartlesshealer> @SirGO0SE Fair point
[3:48:12] <%swesterly> SO WITH SADNESS IN MY HEART
[3:48:15] <Them00n> Why would he not just repeat the thing that works?
[3:48:16] <Ipsenscastle> Maybe if you try that same thing again
[3:48:16] <ShinobiPhoenix> i don't think professionals could hit this shot
[3:48:17] <%swesterly> FEEL THE BEST THING I CAN DO
[3:48:18] <%Niney_Who> just shoot the pins
[3:48:21] <ミュウレ4242> OtterExpress, just semi-pro.
[3:48:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe slower?
[3:48:22] <%Aeoneth> More right
[3:48:22] <StrawberryTofu1> This is a very strange way of investigating a murder
[3:48:24] <psimon_> hard to watch
[3:48:25] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> Less Power?
[3:48:25] <%swesterly> IS END IT ALL AND LEAVE FOR EVER
[3:48:26] <+jake_rmd> u got this
[3:48:27] <%chubbypencil> is this the whole stream>
[3:48:27] <%dinnydanny777> Have you tried hitting it straight on the right hand side so that the pin hits the right side of the one in the middle and it flies into the pins on the left?
[3:48:28] <+Merhabi> Go to left pat you got so close on left
[3:48:30] <%ssjklyco> Pat is making horse noises. Does that mean he is going to race paige?
[3:48:30] <Zayasu> who needs yakuza Kappa
[3:48:32] <%Niney_Who> He's Neighing
[3:48:33] <+ATentacleMonster> oh wow

[3:48:38] <%Maids4lyfe> TOO MUCH SPIN
[3:48:40] <usurper_sos> YEAH
[3:48:41] <Droozy01> maybe the opposite will work low power and left spin
[3:48:42] <+G_Thunders> You have to hit them
[3:48:43] <+Yokuho> WEAK + Heavy
[3:48:44] <ppararaj> I think you need to hit the 4 pin on its left side
[3:48:45] <%Stonebeard> "What if we just do the same thing over and over, Zach?"
[3:48:48] <Ipsenscastle> Have you tried shooting a dog though?
[3:48:49] <+Shoosler> ...getting better..!
[3:48:49] <3viltiki> Dig up
[3:48:49] <+NotSoAccurateNo1> you gotta get that full left spin from left side, pointed right, and lightball
[3:48:50] <%swesterly> I WISH THAT I COULD TURN BACK TIME
[3:48:50] <Pnutz409> Pros almost never get into this situation heh
[3:48:51] <SJK300> Truly the Dark Souls of mini games
[3:48:52] <qo_op> pat "but the big number tho" staresat
[3:48:53] <%dinnydanny777> Try straight down the right hand side
[3:48:54] <+ATentacleMonster> it's like the pins repelled the ball holy shit
[3:48:57] <Maxwell_Bronson> Damnit
[3:48:57] <+zigzagreus> Aim to the left of the 4 pin and put a slight spin to the left on it, its precise but it works, I've done it
[3:48:59] <+Electric_J> Aim left, curve left
[3:49:00] <+Awestonio> yes, go left
[3:49:02] <%swesterly> CUZ NOW THE GUILT IS ALL MINE
[3:49:02] <mrlastchance1> Best bowling content on the internet
[3:49:03] <%CommanderSqueaks> How long have we been on this now?
[3:49:04] <amonimis> ok how about this, lorge ball aimed at number 4 pin with right spin
[3:49:05] <zenith0111> SPIN LEFT
[3:49:06] <OtterExpress> the only way to end the suffering is throw the ball straight up and hope it lands on your head
[3:49:08] <%bigboyeggo> IT AAAAALLLL RETUUUUURNS TO NOOOOOTHIIIING
[3:49:08] <iheatthis12> go weak
[3:49:09] <Them00n> 4 pin left side max left spin light ball.
[3:49:10] <%Niney_Who> no your other left
[3:49:11] <%joylent_blue> maybe curve it into the left corner like that one time
[3:49:11] <+inopss> No right left
[3:49:12] <%PanicSwytch> Oh man this is giving me yakuza 0 bowling ptsd
[3:49:12] <%JerredTheAndal> York bankrupts himself playing bowling
[3:49:13] <+Awestonio> Aim left

[3:49:17] <RagingLeo> -several hours later-
[3:49:18] <+lazysaiyajin> 25% power
[3:49:19] <Ipsenscastle> You haven't shot enough dogs to level up your bowling skill

[3:49:29] <%swesterly> Place your bets
[3:49:32] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt Stand center aim over the center arrow arrow aim and curve the ball left while shooting the ball at the far far right pin
[3:49:32] <%CommanderSqueaks> Maybe less power?
[3:49:34] <%DetroitSentai> slight
[3:49:35] <+ATentacleMonster> lol
[3:49:35] <+zigzagreus> heavier ball
[3:49:35] <TrashbagZombie> too much
[3:49:38] <%machshop> no do it better
[3:49:38] <kiwicoffin> I assume you want to attack inwards

[3:49:38] <+2hutown> slight
[3:49:39] <%Aeoneth> Too much left
[3:49:39] <%joylent_blue> do it better tho
[3:49:40] <%CommanderSqueaks> Gotta Go Slow
[3:49:40] <%dinnydanny777> If you can get it to the right of the middle pin on the right it should bounce into the other pins
[3:49:41] <bosssbatttle> oh my god
[3:49:42] <%bigboyeggo> at least a thousand
[3:49:43] <TeethandHunger> He'll never be able to hit the front pins withe pins in the back row.

[3:49:43] <%Metballs> Do it bettererer
[3:49:44] <Pnutz409> slice the 4 pin on the left side
[3:49:47] <+xeros720> think there's a voodoo doll for bowling?
[3:49:47] <%Dakuu75> walk over to the pins and kick them down...
[3:49:48] <iheatthis12> Use way less power

[3:51:55] <%Garthunox> more testicles means more iron
[3:51:57] <Maxwell_Bronson> Damnit
[3:51:57] <%PanicSwytch> P o w e r....give me MORE POWER
[3:51:58] <noyman2000> Swish

[3:52:03] <qo_op> how can this be?
[3:52:03] <+KingOfTheGeats> I need more BOWLING POWER
[3:52:05] <Them00n> How much has been spent on this game?
[3:52:08] <%DappercatEsquire> Like even with the video showing exactly how to do it, and hitting what looked like the exact power and spin, always had the 6 pin left standing
[3:52:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt It was that or go to my sisters soccer games
[3:52:11] <%CommanderSqueaks> MORE POWER
[3:52:11] <%Dakuu75> I need more quantum power~!
[3:52:14] <+Merhabi> PArgon Pargon Pargon
[3:52:16] <Idon__> "What are you gonna do with all that power?" "YOU'RE WASTING MY MONEY."
[3:52:16] <%swesterly> Did you save before this Pat?
[3:52:17] <%Niney_Who> no
[3:52:18] <%SirGO0SE> i used to work at an alley and repair machines but i suck ass at bowling LUL
[3:52:18] <%Robot_Nixon_> moon2JIMBO I've bowled a whole 4 times, I know a thing or two

[3:52:25] <%honeyman18> Whats the guide online say for this?
[3:52:25] <%Metballs> Pat...
[3:52:25] <%swesterly> This is a lot of money

[3:52:27] <%bigboyeggo> @PatStaresAt PAT USE YOURSELF AS THE BALL
[3:52:29] <olaksi> Not again
[3:52:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> BABA
[3:52:30] <+zigzagreus> If you dont spin left the pin wont fly across I think, I used a heavier ball
[3:52:30] <bosssbatttle> he still cant get it with the cheats KEK
[3:52:30] <Maxwell_Bronson> Damnit
[3:52:31] <crankyvt> this is the most expensive bowling game
[3:52:33] <star_feline> SMOrc why not woooork
[3:52:35] <%joylent_blue> you can almost taste it
[3:52:36] <%Niney_Who> "What if... I ignore the cheating"
[3:52:38] <%Robot_Nixon_> LUL
[3:52:39] <+Merhabi> pat that's not how physics work
[3:52:40] <usurper_sos> Pat . . .
[3:52:41] <+jiggy_snipe> Kappa
[3:52:42] <+xeros720> pat isn't regulation size
[3:52:42] <%CarrowayFashonti> Congrats, you failed while also being heavier
[3:52:42] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat does not understand the idea of using LESS power to accomplish goals
[3:52:43] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeah Pat Bowling Ball could do it
[3:52:44] <%Dakuu75> got'em
[3:52:45] <%DatGuyJimbo> this diner owner is making BANK
[3:52:49] <Ipsenscastle> use your skateboard spin move
[3:52:51] <Them00n> Just throw 2 balls at the same time.
[3:52:51] <kiwicoffin> throw Patti
[3:52:51] <Idon__> Use the GUN
[3:52:52] <$spardanwarrior> Tap into your inner orb
[3:52:52] <%Niney_Who> LESS IS MORE
[3:52:53] <%SpicyVibration> orb into the pins
[3:52:57] <%Robot_Nixon_> 4Head just throw yourself
[3:52:58] <+jiggy_snipe> Pat only understands BIG NUMBERS
[3:52:59] <%Garthunox> remember blitzball?
[3:53:00] <bosssbatttle> So much money down the drain
[3:53:00] <+Merhabi> use more dakka not better?
[3:53:01] <+Electric_J> Just do a Blanka ball down the lane
[3:53:03] <%PettyFunk> I feel like Pat likes using the heavier ball because in the brain that means it's like a greatsword
[3:53:03] <%toastybites> Pat is trying to brute force the laws of physics
[3:53:04] <%CommanderSqueaks> "Pat maybe use less power" "I do not understand what you are saying."
[3:53:05] <%honeyman18> I went for a walk and He's still doing the bowling
[3:53:05] <usurper_sos> Become the ball
[3:53:06] <%Dakuu75> make the ball "Wallie"
[3:53:07] <TrashbagZombie> Slight left spin maybe?
[3:53:08] <qu3kl41n_the_impure_king> ummmm why not down the right side?
[3:53:09] <%joylent_blue> LUL
[3:53:09] <iheatthis12> I wounder how many in day games he been doing this ?
[3:53:11] <Idon__> Get Zach to do it for you
[3:53:11] <%GarbageNirvana> how much money did he start off with?
[3:53:11] <%Chester_goes_Berserk> lighter ball gurl
[3:53:12] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt stand behind the left center arrow aim towards the right most pin and put max spin on the ball left
[3:53:13] <%dinnydanny777> Try less power and the pin might actually stay on the lane?
[3:53:17] <+MegaCorpltd> Orb into the flame
[3:53:18] <star_feline> Spin sligtly left
[3:53:19] <+jiggy_snipe> @toastybites LUL
[3:53:20] <%Metballs> SHADOW PUZZLES
[3:53:22] <%bigboyeggo> just roll down the lane while screaming as loud as you can
[3:53:27] <%swesterly> I can’t believe this
[3:53:32] <+Kenzo2000> Can you make a fifteen minute twitch clip?
[3:53:37] <DrGasMax> I did this for like two hours and never got it, how are you fairing?
[3:53:38] <+Merhabi> I say listen to doc ock
[3:53:40] <%DetroitSentai> There are voodoo idols that make the spin icon move slower so it is easier
[3:53:41] <+Merhabi> he's a doctor
[3:53:44] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Use less power, Pat. Pretend you're throwing Tod Howard's tiny tiny balls
[3:53:47] <%swesterly> Pat you’ll need to save scum soon don’t spend $2k on this
[3:53:48] <+professormorrigan> but baba
[3:53:48] <%PanicSwytch> I want this to be the rest of the stream
[3:53:50] <ShinobiPhoenix> how long exactly has Pat been stuck on this?
[3:53:52] <SJK300> Half the power so the pins don't shoot instantly to the back wall
[3:53:53] <TeethandHunger> This is what happens to people who hate Blanka
[3:53:53] <%doc_ock_rokc> too far to the left
[3:53:55] <qo_op> how can this be?
[3:53:59] <Idon__> Jebaited
[3:54:00] <Ipsenscastle> from the center
[3:54:00] <%CommanderSqueaks> @ShinobiPhoenix At least 30 minutes
[3:54:04] <%DappercatEsquire> I love the Big Five stream
[3:54:05] <%SpicyVibration> only 1000 tries left
[3:54:08] <CursedNobleman> why is he doing this again? mind gobbos?
[3:54:09] <%swesterly> Almost
[3:54:15] <+Merhabi> if you hit the pin on the right it will go left, if you hit it on the left it will go right
[3:54:17] <Idon__> CURSE YOU SWERY
[3:54:18] <%joylent_blue> you gotta be reallll precise with that
[3:54:21] <%CommanderSqueaks> @CursedNobleman You get charm I thnk
[3:54:21] <+jake_rmd> this some sad shit my man
[3:54:22] <iheatthis12> LUL
[3:54:22] <%MuffledEurobeat> c'mon Pat, you gotta get count there
[3:54:23] <ShinobiPhoenix> for real? 30 minutes on bowling?
[3:54:24] <%swesterly> Once again you are at least experimenting with CURVING
[3:54:24] <%doc_ock_rokc> move to the left a bit
[3:54:25] <%CommanderSqueaks> DID IT
[3:54:25] <$HyperionXV> Anyone know how much money he had when he started this?
[3:54:26] <%honeyman18> this is fairlyinteresting
[3:54:28] <%dinnydanny777> You can probably take out the three on the right and knock the middle pin into the pins on the left
[3:54:29] <%CommanderSqueaks> YOU DID IT PAT
[3:54:32] <%joylent_blue> CursedNobleman there's a reward that's SURELY worth it
[3:54:37] <+professormorrigan> money ceases to be
[3:54:37] <Them00n> You got to move over left first.
[3:54:38] <ミュウレ4242> CursedNobleman, it's slowly becoming personal.
[3:54:38] <Shishi1205> lol
[3:54:38] <DrGasMax> It is believed that getting this is completely RNG based because there is no surefire way to get it every single time
[3:54:40] <StrawberryTofu1> Is York gonna go bankrupt?
[3:54:41] <kiwicoffin> @CursedNobleman he has to impress the old lady at the lanes
[3:54:42] <+Shoosler> dude.. just SEND IT
[3:54:44] <+HotBloodedHero> Bowling physics is a fun puzzle of trial and error.
[3:54:46] <%toastybites> omg
[3:54:46] <CursedNobleman> @joylent_blue DansGame
[3:54:46] <Ipsenscastle> too much angle
[3:54:46] <+SaltMaestroSupreme> HEY NICO WE SHOULD GO BOWLING

[3:54:48] <%PettyFunk> @ShinobiPhoenix We'll get to the other Wii sports later.
[3:54:53] <+Electric_J> Every time he's gotten close its because he did a specific thing but he keeps doing everything EXCEPT that thing
[3:54:54] <%doc_ock_rokc> too much angle
[3:54:54] <%Doruben> Doruben subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 31 months! bool
[3:54:55] <%PettyFunk> Secret move
[3:54:55] <mrlastchance1> York don't need money
[3:54:57] <shieldecho> I stepped away for ten minutes or so, has he been bowling the whole time?
[3:54:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Yeayea do it
[3:54:59] <%DappercatEsquire> @PatStaresAt Throw Patti down the lane
[3:54:59] <usurper_sos> You're getting better
[3:55:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> No, you'll fall on your ass because the lanes are waxed.
[3:55:01] <CursedNobleman> @kiwicoffin legit. woolieGIRLS
[3:55:02] <+jiggy_snipe> yep

[3:55:09] <Idon__> "Zach, remember the time we blew 2000 dollars on bowling? Good times."
[3:55:11] <%doc_ock_rokc> almost
[3:55:13] <iheatthis12> i hope at the end when he finally get it he game crashes
[3:55:13] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat, bowling lanes are waxed, you'll fall straight onto your ass and break it
[3:55:16] <Ipsenscastle> York takes his frustration out later by shooting 50 wild dogs
[3:55:17] <shieldecho> Nice
[3:55:18] <+FattimusSlime> Pat could have spent this money on a hotel room, but instead he spent it all on bowling.
[3:55:19] <+Merhabi> Thanks for the PrideLaugh @doruben
[3:55:19] <+king_of_beggars> Pat, the tip of the arrow draws a line, stop pointing the line into the gutter.
[3:55:20] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Patty would crush this in a second
[3:55:20] <ChrisM341> New Bowling puzzle for RE8? Kappa
[3:55:21] <SJK300> Let Peach so you how to curve some balls Kappa
[3:55:22] <%Robot_Nixon_> Patty's getting an early retirement
[3:55:24] <%JerredTheAndal> you cant just kick over the pins, this isnt vietnam, there are rule
[3:55:24] <tranquilturnip> Wallie time
[3:55:28] <ミュウレ4242> can always just kill dogs and squirrels for cash. might as well be yakuza.
[3:55:29] <%joylent_blue> maybe if you did your new skateboard spin attack on the pins
[3:55:33] <+HotBloodedHero> Too much spin
[3:55:39] <DrGasMax> I easily put 1000 bucks trying to beat this
[3:55:39] <%doc_ock_rokc> its closer
[3:55:39] <+Merhabi> so how's yalls week
[3:55:41] <+jake_rmd> do the left side again
[3:55:43] <%arancet> good stream pat
[3:55:43] <%dinnydanny777> Can't you move right instead of aiming down the centre like that?
[3:55:44] <%swesterly> Ok what if we were more methodical here
[3:55:47] <ammobasket> A strange game, the only winning move is not to play
[3:55:47] <ShinobiPhoenix> whose the lady who owns this Diner again?
[3:55:47] <%GarbageQueenEllie> maybe if use slow throw
[3:55:49] <%CommanderSqueaks> Is Pat sundowning?
[3:55:51] <%toastybites> im screaming
[3:55:51] <+professormorrigan> his smile and optimism: gone
[3:55:54] <+kimbosegg> Not enough meatspin
[3:55:54] <TheDewdHole> You had it close with the heaviest aimed at the left
[3:55:57] <+Shoosler> that was close
[3:55:59] <+Delenay> how much money has he spent on this?
[3:55:59] <+Yokuho> too strong every time
[3:56:00] <%joylent_blue> the MADMAN
[3:56:01] <%CommanderSqueaks> Slow down the ball!
[3:56:02] <%swesterly> Close
[3:56:03] <+jiggy_snipe> ?
[3:56:03] <%joylent_blue> damn
[3:56:04] <%Captain_Doomsday> Spin has failed you, use Hamon.
[3:56:04] <%AlfredoCavatelli> LE CARRE, LA: FBI agent arrested after shooting rampage in local diner

[3:56:11] <Idon__> F U C K
[3:56:13] <Them00n> I think it's gotta be the 4 pin.
[3:56:15] <+Merhabi> i don't know what he's thinking
[3:56:15] <%joylent_blue> a couple hundred dollars at this point
[3:56:16] <DrGasMax> Did he not already look up people doing it online?
[3:56:18] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat you don't need to go STRONG all the time.
[3:56:18] <ghostman27> how long has pat been doing this
[3:56:18] <iheatthis12> Pat just kick the pins
[3:56:19] <MrDoomtastic44> How about stand at far left, aim to the right, spin to the left
[3:56:20] <+kimbosegg> You spin me right round baby
[3:56:21] <%AngriestAngryArtist> too STRONK!
[3:56:21] <mrlastchance1> Phyics pat, physics
[3:56:22] <Ipsenscastle> why are you using strong power every single time?
[3:56:22] <%dinnydanny777> Try less power
[3:56:22] <%Metballs> No, it HAS to travel at lightspeed, it's the only way
[3:56:23] <+HotBloodedHero> CLOOOSE
[3:56:23] <+Merhabi> that's good
[3:56:23] <%doc_ock_rokc> @PatStaresAt The goal is to get the ball to curve into the right most pocket on the right side
[3:56:27] <%Captain_Doomsday> BS the pins don't bounce if you slam them into the back.
[3:56:27] <amonimis> less power
[3:56:28] <ChrisM341> That Harmonica is depressing
[3:56:29] <%toastybites> MEDIUM POWER
[3:56:29] <noyman2000> Feels like Quint
[3:56:31] <fuji_92> aim for the first two spin patty with the left pin use the heavy ball to curve
[3:56:32] <%Stonebeard> big strong do fast good
[3:56:35] <%CommanderSqueaks> LESS POWER
[3:56:35] <+Slamantha> so good! slamanPog
[3:56:36] <%MechArch> psaHoldon

[3:56:37] <%joylent_blue> almost
[3:56:39] <amonimis> like, 50% power
[3:56:42] <%swesterly> Do that again but less power
[3:56:42] <%Robot_Nixon_> Too much of a little bit
[3:56:42] <+kimbosegg> makes me feel happy i did this in 2 tries
[3:56:44] <%SpicyVibration> The bar owner is rolling in it by now
[3:56:44] <star_feline> Clearly needs MORE power Kappa
[3:56:48] <+Merhabi> i think you are under using the low end of the power bar
[3:56:48] <%swesterly> No LESS power
[3:56:48] <%SirGO0SE> hitting 4 pin on its left side, right chat?
[3:56:49] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> This is truly the Shadow Puzzle of our Friends We Made Along The Way, DELTER
[3:56:49] <lbrownthedestroyer> Meduim power give the ball some spin
[3:56:51] <JDebss> Splits are bullshit
[3:56:51] <%joylent_blue> but.... MORE POWER lytMOTIVATED

[3:56:53] <%AlfredoCavatelli> psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong psaWrong
[3:56:54] <%CommanderSqueaks> Oh god Pat cannot comprehend the idea of not going full blast the entire time
[3:56:54] <Ipsenscastle> maybe try SMALL number for once
[3:56:54] <%swesterly> LESS power
[3:56:55] <%SirGO0SE> that actually looked right
[3:56:55] <+jake_rmd> Just slam that b down the left
[3:56:56] <%AngriestAngryArtist> Oh shit!
[3:56:56] <SomeAsianDood> Nemesis upgraded from Quint to a bunch of bowling pins LUL
[3:56:58] <ZComiX> 16 Lbs, All the way Left, 85% strength, Very slight spin Left
[3:56:58] <%Garthunox> @patstaresat just hit the pins 4head
[3:56:58] <%GarbageQueenEllie> Do it with like zero power
[3:56:59] <TheDewdHole> That might be the way
[3:56:59] <tranquilturnip> @PatStaresAt try light ball, slow as possible aim left
[3:57:01] <TheDewdHole> keep trying
[3:57:03] <%toastybites> NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[3:57:04] <%PettyFunk> You may not want to do max power every time Pat, the pin will get knocked over if you're making contact
[3:57:04] <+Electric_J> do that but better
[3:57:04] <Idon__> My soul is dying a little more for every 2 dollar fifty cent spent
[3:57:05] <%dave323dave> just try every combination of power angle and spin
[3:57:08] <%joylent_blue> power is a CHOICE, Pat
[3:57:08] <%AlfredoCavatelli> 1
[3:57:09] <%CommanderSqueaks> Pat literally cannot comprehend the idea of LESS POWER
[3:57:10] <%doc_ock_rokc> gutter
[3:57:11] <ZComiX> 16 Lbs, All the way Left, 85% strength, Very slight spin Left 1
[3:57:11] <ミュウレ4242> he can keep doing this another thousand times w/o having to stop. and even then, just to load his save.
[3:57:12] <%Hegelundra> first half of the stream was story content at least
[3:57:12] <SJK300> Little less curve
[3:57:13] <+ATentacleMonster> :(
[3:57:14] <+professormorrigan> any day now pat
[3:57:15] <%Ragnvaldr_AGH> PatBowlsAt, the new amazing stream content
[3:57:16] <ppararaj> Less power means the pin won't fly back as much
[3:57:18] <fuji_92> nice
[3:57:19] <SJK300> Power was way better
[3:57:20] <%arancet> just mash button til go
[3:57:20] <+Merhabi> @SirGO0SE Exactly
[3:57:20] <%Aeoneth> Why don't you just hit all the pins?
[3:57:21] <%ArtoriasTheTrenchfighter> That but further right, i think
[3:57:21] <%BallerSwagBro9k> LUL LUL LUL
[3:57:22] <%CommanderSqueaks> I'm ascending

[3:57:23] <%AngriestAngryArtist> NEED POWER MORE POWER!
[3:57:24] <Zebroneath> "York, what was the reason for spending hundreds of dollars on bowling?"
[3:57:24] <%DappercatEsquire> @SirGO0SE Yeah, that's the common way to do it, but you need to be dead on with the power and spin, or the 6 will stay up
[3:57:25] <bosssbatttle> this is peak pat
[3:57:26] <delta0093> ResidentSleeper
[3:57:26] <@PlagueOfGripes> someone cast a shadow on the lane

[4:11:51] <%MajorCrasher> I'd take 5 for sure
[4:11:51] <%DappercatEsquire> It's worse because it seems like there's an element of RNG to it
[4:11:51] <%chiazamformerlymankeyfigh> Like will two seperate whores work the same job?
[4:11:56] <%king_wragles> @SGrim oh HOLY FUCK
