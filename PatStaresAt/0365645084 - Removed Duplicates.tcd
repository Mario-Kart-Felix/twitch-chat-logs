Especially when you find out you WERE remembering the full procedure, the whole time, but your doubt made you think you were missing something.

[0:08:35] <%Archer2150> PETROL IS JUST GAS
[0:08:35] <RichAnvils> it is an unternal COMBUSTION engine, so it does explode

[0:08:41] <$nademonkey1100> FUCK YOU MOOBOT
[0:08:41] <+ScopeResolutionOperator> I agree with pat
[0:08:41] <Inebriateddonut> Pat you should stream yourself painting art :)
[0:08:41] <mercado94> i see
[0:08:41] <ReiDuran> Art exists to create some kind of reaction and the reaction I get from Pollock's stuff is "wow this is stupid"
[0:08:42] <$SGrim> Petrol is gasoline, so same thing
[0:08:42] <+luketrapwalker> If it's normal gas, it's fine

[0:08:43] <Cranky_Construct> did he just revert invertedplane controls
[0:08:43] <Gruhunchously> Beater the meater
[0:08:43] <WaxWitch> art is subjective and ppl will pull meaning out of their ass
[0:08:44] <guardmightgetnervous> Expensive paper weight
[0:08:44] <ForgetfulUthanasiast> Put Bible's in it, works fine for me
[0:08:44] <BayowolfTerra> LUL its the fucking best!
[0:08:44] <%Wrashis> remember that time when bayo 1 forced you to do a plane game with inverted controls and it was the worst
[0:08:44] <RichAnvils> Woolie like big splatter
[0:08:45] <AirlineFood74> @usetheboost3d it's more like "Go fuck yourself"
[0:08:45] <reonome> use your guns pat
[0:08:45] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@3xgilly) (warning)

[0:08:47] <+JayEarly> I love that Southern boah
[0:08:48] <Coystick> They don't make cars small enough
[0:08:48] <Worldbrand> Diesel engines can be modified to run off of, like, fryer oil though
[0:08:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Do your distance in kiloparsecs
[0:08:48] <+zaworldo> FUCK YOU DO IT IN FEET
[0:08:48] <%Skrypto> @AngriestPat do you prefer flightstick or controller? apatLiz

[0:08:49] <%king_wragles> ... Petrol is gasoline
[0:08:49] <+CaptainJax> do it you antiweeb fuck
[0:08:49] <%lewdskeletor13> This looks good and bad at the same time
[0:08:49] <ShimmerFairy> I can't think of a situation where inverted controls make more sense than a plane game.
[0:08:50] <%HoboFlowers> Yw pat
[0:08:50] <omen_setter> It's like giving peanut butter to a car that is allergic to peanut butter
[0:08:50] <omen_setter> I enjoy it when something wholehearted believes in its premise
[0:08:50] <omen_setter> Nobunaga was a fluent speaker of modern English
[0:08:50] <%Wrashis> but the rest of the game was amazing
[0:08:50] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> hey i think someone is trying to shoot a missile at you

[0:08:52] <ScreamingMeat> Is that a goddamn railway going across the sea?

[0:08:53] <%nobunagaesq> did he say anything about me?
[0:08:55] <$D4C_Trice> Petrol is gas
[0:08:55] <+ManicManson> It causes friction which may actually cause it to explode
[0:08:55] <%topendbuzz> Gas is petrol because usa is a dumb place
[0:08:55] <%Skrypto> LUL
[0:08:55] <+JediWomprat> No you watch it

[0:08:58] <%thebonebard> ok some of these paintings are nice but they arent the paint drip ones
[0:08:58] <bearwagon> based on what foundation?
[0:08:59] <+Sonic_Hero23> Hey, art history major here. The intrigue with Jackson Pollock isn't supposed to be the final painting, but rather the movement behind the actual painting process. The painting is just a snapshot of a performance art piece. That said, I am also indifferent to Pollock.
[0:08:59] <%Archer2150> Woah there
[0:08:59] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Only cowards switch to Japanese

[0:14:45] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> cheer500 Hello Pat, one of my employees last night put regular gas into a diesel truck pretty much RIGHT as I got home, and having no memory of the full procedure the company takes right after an accident like that, when you are now the manager and SHOULD remember how that goes, is not a fun feeling. Especially when you find out you WERE remembering the full procedure, the whole time, but your doubt made you think you were missing something.

[0:22:38] <%Skeletorexplains> you also have a normie sword
[0:22:38] <%radda343> Samanosuke went to the Metal Gear School of No Mouthflaps
[0:22:38] <%BetesBoy> Magic missile
[0:22:38] <AggsMK7> They double invert?
[0:22:38] <suikudo> FUcking dip shits that elevator is fucking important

[0:22:41] <$Brother_Coduss> @pimpinahz Oni are ogres. Yokai are demons
[0:22:41] <%SpamKingRathalos> erb
[0:22:41] <privatesargent> the fuck? inverted is correct
[0:22:41] <%Freakin_Osvaldo> I just finished this game this morning

[0:22:42] <BayowolfTerra> Oooh
[0:22:42] <%Wrashis> hey pat you should pick up and read that file
[0:22:42] <callsigneagle01> I don't quite get why Japan always shows Nobunaga as super evil. He never really got very far in conquering Japan.
[0:22:43] <%king_wragles> Yo, kill that soldier who didn't do anything to you.
[0:22:43] <+Griffin1171> I've got all the power I need, Right here!

[0:22:43] <%kiiiirsten> @IminyourBase Right?
[0:22:43] <%Owkono> that's how planes work
[0:22:43] <+Flamefish345> So which version of Onimusha Warlords should I get? PS4 or Switch?
[0:22:44] <Coystick> Is this a fixed camera action game?
[0:22:44] <cherrycottontail> so why are we playing this again
[0:22:44] <%Skeletorexplains> normie sword
[0:22:44] <pimpinahz> so Demon Warrior
[0:22:44] <Notalza> look at that metal gear shift
[0:22:44] <voyagerwitch> oh so non-inverted is inverted
[0:22:44] <%LethargicRush> @kabishen no one knows what a ra-seru is
[0:22:44] <lotharrio> Pat is downplaying things. In Onimusha 2, there's relationship mechanics.
[0:22:45] <Blank9> the lockon movement is the best compromise to tank controls
[0:22:45] <Gruhunchously> Pearl Harbour?
[0:22:45] <%kamen_advent> Onimusha needs a new game. Just not with Soki. Fuck him
[0:22:45] <%jiin6> all those missed missles
[0:22:45] <mercado94> just like dororo!
[0:22:45] <%gus_hornblende> It is scenes like those that get me looking up things like "wait how DID nobunaga die"
[0:22:45] <Geno4344> what if oda nobunaga is a demon
[0:22:46] <coldnoid> there's literally nothing wrong with tank controls
[0:22:46] <%Keyd00d> MISS
[0:22:46] <+MyDarkStorm> Not The Demons
[0:22:46] <AggsMK7> Butt demons?
[0:22:46] <DarkKnightGrave> I like how he stuck out his neck for that.
[0:22:46] <%WackyGear> is that his waifu
[0:22:47] <%jiin6> NOT SUS AT ALL pat
[0:22:47] <%ThePuddingDead> main guns jack ass
[0:22:47] <sirmousehatter> It just has a few scratches on it
[0:22:48] <%kamen_advent> Analog control was in the original PS2 version if I remember right
[0:22:48] <%TheyCallMeVawn> This is my favorite Resident Evil game
[0:22:48] <+usetheboost3d> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, the controls are correct then
[0:22:48] <RogueKnightXIII> Ye spec into int
[0:22:48] <medjoe> Do a barrel roll.
[0:22:48] <AggsMK7> He's too good for you
[0:22:48] <%jiin6> but demons? not GOOD
[0:22:48] <%CubicPhantom> he was the only thing holding them back!
[0:22:49] <Kyderz3> weapon quick change triggers @AngriestPat
[0:22:49] <GyroBrando> blaze it
[0:22:49] <+Xalgar> forsenH VOICE ACTING
[0:22:49] <+Blankets_and_Tea> normal = inverted
[0:22:49] <ScreamingMeat> You can hear Jubie's english VA get over his accent throughout Oni 2
[0:22:49] <+MakotoPB> when you want to make sure to let people know the soldier is a jobber, make sure he is 1 or 2 pieces why of full samurai armor
[0:22:49] <%Skrypto> Seems Legit
[0:22:49] <alwayspronking> Do we know what we're messing with?
[0:22:50] <%Skeletorexplains> Finally, a game that appreciates the Wizard races..
[0:22:50] <%jiin6> C really STANDS FOR CRAZY TALK
[0:22:50] <+Grayhammatter> why would they double invery?
[0:22:50] <%MagickBurritoh> PROTECT THAT HARBOR
[0:22:50] <zafooru> Blue Demon JR joins the fray?
[0:22:50] <%lewdskeletor13> SHOW PEPIS COWARD
[0:22:50] <%D_day> Where's his ambition though?
[0:22:50] <inz0mbiac> Nobunaga dead but the ambition still burns
[0:22:51] <+Andrizzleton> H Jon Benjamin?
[0:22:51] <+wrinklemydinkle> he's got that missile proof armor
[0:22:51] <%goose_attack_almanac> @suikudo Which scene?
[0:22:51] <+CruciformDragon> are demons like the gobolins?
[0:22:52] <%CaptainPileDriver> so, do you recommend buying this game?
[0:22:52] <Who_lio42> lol the magic gauntlet came with instructions?
[0:22:52] <lionmanguy> Oh was that not game over
[0:22:53] <%jpf1256> Tank controls are bad imo

[0:22:53] <%Kiwami_gaim> @AngriestPat how does the remaster feel
[0:22:53] <BaronVonDickButt> SHOOOOT HEEEERR!
[0:22:53] <%lewdskeletor13> Do the Erusians want a race war?
[0:22:54] <gustavozxd> tank controls work well with this game
[0:22:54] <%Voidwyvern> ah yes the feudal arklay mountains
[0:22:54] <+Cyoctane> Onimusha is Japanese for reading the mind of your opponent
[0:22:54] <MrFoodski> maxyyHeal
[0:22:54] <energywarning> fucking normie armor
[0:22:54] <%FrostMass22> Highway to the DANGER ZONE
[0:22:54] <%Skeletorexplains> spooky
[0:22:54] <Inebriateddonut> Not the Oni D:
[0:22:55] <%Voidwyvern> R2 and L2 will be a quick weapon switch which did not exist in the original
[0:22:55] <CalderGaming> arklay is really based in japan the whole time
[0:22:55] <%salty_syd913> hmm suspicious
[0:22:55] <+Griffin1171> "BAD"
[0:22:55] <eccentricprinceofroses> I tried playing this couldn't get used to the controls after so much dark souls
[0:22:56] <omen_setter> He looks like he has an Omni-tool
[0:22:56] <DarkKnightGrave> Does this have any of the Genma shit in this?
[0:22:56] <$Chimeraelite> Ohhhhhh
[0:22:56] <callsigneagle01> Oh no it's Port St Hewlett 2.0
[0:22:56] <Polengoldur> so we're just gonna skip over from how she became a civy to a proper pilot?
[0:22:56] <+kuervojones> Brownie should be called Knockers
[0:22:56] <+Freelance_Astronaut> Nobunaga is dead but a thousands games will be made in his name
[0:22:56] <Tucker0603> BUTT DEMONS!!
[0:22:56] <sosuke5> Just like my animes
[0:22:57] <+DodrioTheSir> No inverted is correct!
[0:22:57] <buffmurffy> was dmc1 that long after this?
[0:22:57] <frank89rm> GO COCKPIT VIEW
[0:22:57] <Blank9> missiles don't often kill in one volley
[0:22:58] <AggsMK7> No brakes on the Samo train
[0:22:58] <NavigatorBR> Fuck, what I miss, we were scrambling last I checked?
[0:22:58] <omen_setter> I was shocked when I first played a demo for Ace Combat and learned later it was a Japanese series
[0:22:58] <%AncelDeLambert> decellarating is for LOSERS
[0:22:58] <+darkmithrionx> She DED

[0:23:00] <%VRNK> PogChamp
[0:23:01] <mercado94> running wasnt invented back then
[0:23:01] <ScreamingMeat> R2 cycles through swords L2 cycle through bow and gun
[0:23:01] <DarkKnightGrave> Always Run
[0:23:01] <Marco_Apollo> Its over 9000
[0:23:01] <+SebastianSB> this feels so much like the intro of The Bouncer
[0:23:02] <zafooru> o no its voldo
[0:23:02] <kaindoog> no u
[0:23:02] <CalderGaming> in onimusha 4 you could spend magic to do a weak issen with much easier timing which was nice for nublets
[0:23:02] <Firesparks> nioh is basically onimusha 4
[0:23:02] <SephirKath> Butt demons? Do they have brown eyes?

[0:23:05] <%TheStarvingGood> R1 lock on to backstep.

[0:23:05] <Dementedpenguin> My Ace Combat instincts are coming back, and I'm not even playing the game yet. o_O
[0:23:05] <%snow_bush> Is this where his wife turns into Yukionna and I have to fight her as a boss?
[0:23:05] <%HoboFlowers> If you think about it animators are just throwing drawings at paper, not art just T-R-A-S-H @AngriestPat
[0:23:06] <+HyraFukit> What are the kanji for his name? What is it supposed to mean?
[0:23:06] <katocrimson> Racoon city was feduel japan all along
[0:23:06] <%Voidwyvern> no Genma shit in this
[0:23:06] <+Xalgar> This is the most PS2 PS2 game LUL
[0:23:06] <HeadsHeldHigh> Hang on Johnson BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
[0:23:07] <%kamen_advent> Basically the composer was pulling a Millie Vanillie and had a ghost writer for his music.
[0:23:07] <%Nobrev> guys in ace combat non inverted is pull down go up
[0:23:07] <%ThatGuyfromMars> DO A BARREL ROLL

[0:23:10] <%Voidwyvern> it was not in the original
[0:23:10] <%UltraCasualBoom> With Resident Evil and DmC all over wonder why they hadn’t done a New Onimusha yet
[0:23:10] <%Voidwyvern> @Flamefish345 I personally love my switch version. ISSEN in bed
[0:23:10] <krymzen5> i just finished unlocking everything in this. i think it still holds up

[0:23:12] <%kiiiirsten> Wow, it's Voldo
[0:23:12] <+chronopaladin> onimusha is just the prequel to resident evil, demons are BOWs
[0:23:12] <a_mad_dragon> he just did
[0:23:12] <%AncelDeLambert> that is correct

[0:23:15] <Gruhunchously> He did a barrel roll
[0:23:15] <gustavozxd> they had a juggle system in this game that was removed and added to dmc

[0:23:17] <thelonechris> RIP moth
[0:23:18] <Conky89> I don't mind tank controls. A modern control scheme can break games not intended for them.
[0:23:18] <%Skrypto> Increase Leg Length
[0:23:18] <ebonifragaria> Oh yes.
[0:23:18] <%lewdskeletor13> Is this an RE prequel? PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[0:23:18] <mr_slaide> Butt demons are the worst. Much worst than penis demons.

[0:23:20] <%TheSpiritof2277> Johnson D:
[0:23:20] <+GamesWithGreg> It was a different time, back when story didn't matter. We just wanted to see cool graphics and awesome gameplay
[0:23:20] <CalderGaming> (genma are the bugs)
[0:23:21] <zafooru> oh my god its also dark souls
[0:23:21] <Valentinius_Anodyne> Use the boost to get through!
[0:23:21] <%lewdskeletor13> Does this game feature Dante from the Devil May Cry series?
[0:23:21] <yamikami13> 12
[0:23:21] <%DavidSanChan> makes me want to play ninja gaiden again
[0:23:22] <%HoboFlowers> And suddenly Cyberpunk2077
[0:23:22] <mr_ESB> Is this pc?
[0:23:22] <+HyraFukit> Thats a cool mechanic
[0:23:22] <Gruhunchously> That is indeed correct.
[0:23:22] <privatesargent> ok, i misunderstood what you mean
[0:23:22] <callsigneagle01> just below him
[0:23:22] <Fujiwara_92> yes
[0:23:22] <+zaworldo> hEY cHAT. this isn't the same girl as before
[0:23:22] <%kamen_advent> @mr_ESB Oni 1 is about as long as a classic RE game. The sequels are much longer.
[0:23:22] <%LethargicRush> BIG BIRD COMIN
[0:23:22] <sosuke5> Samanosuke likes to RUN
[0:23:22] <ScreamingMeat> They redid a lot of voice acting for the Japanese and English dub
[0:23:25] <snatchr5> pervert ninjas
[0:23:25] <gunzerkingdunce> So i put Devil breaker on R2 during the demo, anyone else?
[0:23:25] <KaliasTV> I need a new PC for this :(
[0:23:25] <%maskedriderhero> @callsigneagle01 Nobunaga was historically portrayed as a demon, despite all the good he did for Japan, it was basically propaganda

[0:24:56] <%ThePuddingDead> @AngriestPat A trick I learned is to climb straight up in the air high enough to where the enemy is clumped together, and u rain missiles down from above as you nosedive
[0:24:57] <$D4C_Trice> But I doubt Jean Reno would make a return, he was awful to work with for Onimusha 3 apparently.
[0:24:57] <Twoiis> She could probably wreck woolie in tetris.

[0:26:07] <%nictron90> The timing always seemed kind of wonky and arbitrary, like it has to be 'before' an attack, except what point counts as 'before' is kinda hard to determine for each enemy (at least for me, but I suck at timing stuff)

[0:26:20] <ShichiNoBushi> What's your first interpretation of Nobunaga? Mine is in Sengoku Basara (aka Devil Kings) where in the third game, Heroes, my friends and I had the theory that after he died in the first game, he went to Hell, fought and beat Satan, made him his stand, and uses him when you play him in Heroes.

[0:26:27] <+GamesWithGreg> Onimusha honestly feels like a PS2 tech demo given it's short length, whereas Onimusha 2 and 3 are more fully realized games
[0:26:27] <%kamen_advent> Samanosuke is a better protag but Onimusha 2 is a better game than 1
[0:26:28] <%MightyMaxT> Is that a Mega Buster?
[0:26:28] <%TheShal> Musha means Japanese Sword

[0:27:26] <+HyraFukit> What are the kanji for his name? What is it supposed to mean?
[0:27:27] <%kamen_advent> Basically the composer was pulling a Millie Vanillie and had a ghost writer for his music.
[0:27:27] <CalderGaming> oh right, the song woolie used for scrublords
[0:27:27] <ElliotRyo> This is tremendously gorgeous.

[0:27:31] <%Voidwyvern> The glove does in fact blink
[0:27:31] <callsigneagle01> Literally Belka's fault

[0:27:42] <SirBrawler18> I've never seen a person wo comfortable with cheating.

[0:27:43] <artoflec> @buffmurffy 7 months later, so these games were made at around the same time

[0:30:27] <%nictron90> The timing always seemed kind of wonky and arbitrary, like it has to be 'before' an attack, except what point counts as 'before' is kinda hard to determine for each enemy (at least for me, but I suck at timing stuff)

[0:44:55] <%MagickBurritoh> F2A reminds me of A2M
[0:44:55] <+TheEvaFreak> The color and symbol next to name
[0:44:55] <Videogamer4> purple is multi role
[0:44:55] <+StromkoPenguin> I don't think I would pick on a person who's nickname contains Murderer.

[0:45:15] <+StromkoPenguin> @guruchaz Ace Combat isn't a very realistic game, I doubt it'll punish us for dogfighting in a plane that can barely push 450 mp/h.

[0:45:15] <%TheSpiritof2277> it popped on my email as saying Onimusha

[1:02:14] <+MakotoPB> now i want takoyaki
[1:02:15] <lotharrio> @gustavozxd First of all, having five characters, active swapping and 2p mode is a lot of fun. Second of all, one of the characters is a boxer, and he's great.

[1:15:38] <%Fenrirlives> It's always interesting seeing the different interpretations of Hideyoshi in videogames. The contrast between this, Musou, and Sengoku Basara are wild as heck lol
[1:15:39] <+DesertOfSand> There's like 32 ways to do 5 turns of two knobs, so it's actually kinda impressive hos quickly he got it just guessing
[1:15:39] <Dragon_Batman> Yellow looks pretty good too
[1:15:39] <depressedpepega> It is a puzzle to ruin loners life.
[1:15:39] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> sooo good

[1:15:41] <+Andrizzleton> yeyeyeye
[1:15:41] <+Grayhammatter> he flip, then he rip
[1:15:42] <Vincent508> for a game so focused on melee combat, the bow in this game is surprisingly satisfying to use.

[1:16:00] <gustavozxd> well the interpretations in sengoku basara are always the best ones
[1:16:01] <lotharrio> The difference is the amount of holy water put on it.
[1:16:02] <Daebunz> I played this game fir the first time this past summer and I think I already forgot everything
[1:16:02] <Gruhunchously> @Hyper2faceman You're underpaid, so you just decide to half-ass if in the most blatant way possible.

[1:31:56] <ThirdStrike_Alex> Hey @angriestpat how ya doing?
[1:31:57] <subjectg> 5 and Zero are amazing
[1:31:57] <mrjohncarlton> Five is pretty good but REALLY melodramatic
[1:31:57] <%dmtph> Stream 5
[1:31:57] <artoflec> isnn't Ace Combat 3's subtitlte "ElectroSphere" or some shit
[1:31:58] <Blank9> 5 is great, 0 is the best
[1:31:58] <majindusto> FUCKING ALIENS
[1:31:58] <+KSabot> 5 is second best imo
[1:31:58] <%R0bobot> FALKEN or Wyvern X-02?
[1:31:59] <+drflashylights> Yea
[1:31:59] <mesamus> zero and 5 are amazing
[1:31:59] <UPTONOGOOD18> Shattered Skies is the best imo
[1:31:59] <a_mad_dragon> "pretty close"
[1:32:00] <%Shadowthedigger> Pat is no longer held to the finish games rule of the channel.
[1:32:01] <$QueequegTheater> 5 is widely consudered the best one
[1:32:01] <AggsMK7> Pat beat Don't Shit Your Pants
[1:32:01] <%kiiiirsten> How are you getting close to finishing that at all
[1:32:02] <Stratiotai2> dude i miss playing ace combat 6
[1:32:02] <+fps_russia> Ace Combat : Independence Day
[1:32:02] <%Owkono> yes play 5 for sure

[1:32:04] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm sold on Ace Combat now LUL
[1:32:05] <+JayEarly> Ace Combat has shockingly not cringy live-action FMV
[1:32:05] <xBolts4Lifex> You should plsy 5
[1:32:06] <+Gryphus23> 5 and Zero are the best ones
[1:32:06] <LunarDiscorded> You can still get 5 if you get the Deluxe Edition @AngriestPat
[1:32:07] <privatesargent> 6 is good too but it doesn't hold up to 0 4 and 5
[1:32:07] <%OwlLightningMage> Play the DLCs first you coward
[1:32:08] <Chewfungus> You fight the ai
[1:32:10] <tearsaurther> Rhonda rousey in this game?

[1:32:12] <kabishen> hollow knight
[1:32:13] <BigCoffee> So can you skip 1-2-3 and not miss much?

[1:32:21] <+enterprise900> 4, 5, and Zero are called the Holy Trinity of AC for a reason
[1:32:21] <%ThatGuyfromMars> It's impossible to finish New Vegas, as soon as you do the game bugs out and you start over again

[2:28:25] <VeryTricky> i feel like i played an old ace combat game but my memory is fuzzy
[2:28:25] <%nelsonq415> do you get more points in 1st person ?
[2:28:28] <%MagickBurritoh> THROUGH THE WRECKAGE
[2:28:29] <TrippDoingThings> and same i forgot the name of this series for like 10 years somehow
[2:28:30] <yangaddison> I guess you are nugget then lol
[2:28:30] <KangSameda> Ace combat is pretty visceral to play
[2:28:31] <Videogamer4> I'M CUMMING
[2:28:32] <%McSnazzyPants> @AngriestPat hold down lock on button to follow the target too
[2:28:32] <callsigneagle01> eyyyy

[2:28:37] <BayowolfTerra> I. Love. This. Shit.
[2:28:37] <arcaderabbit48> @defectivefire718 I'd never heard of Highway to Hell until now, and dang. Some of those Stands are clearly tailor-made for a fight, but I cant think of anything more blatant than giving a Pain Split stand to someone who is suicidal.
[2:28:37] <%Skrypto> Hydrate
[2:28:37] <+Taglog7> Hey, Lana
[2:28:38] <+Fyre_link> i love the flight path sumamry screens at the ending of missions
[2:28:39] <callsigneagle01> is useful
[2:28:42] <%TheOnlyStrayCat> @AngriestPat Does this justify the JPEG Dog though?
[2:28:42] <subjectg> Remember, those who survive long enough on the battlefield start to think they’re invincible
[2:28:42] <%Iwantscandy> @AngriestPat would the AC game be good with a HOTAS or no?
[2:28:43] <VeryTricky> were there other notable jet fighter games during the 360?
[2:28:43] <mayorrev> Is this Metal Gear 6?
[2:28:46] <CopperTucker> Mission Status: SICK
[2:28:46] <Gruhunchously> What war crimes will we commit today?
[2:28:48] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> its a waste of money to put cameras on missiles, how unrealistic can you get
[2:28:50] <AnimeJedi25> DANGER ZONE
[2:28:50] <OToole42> @AncelDeLambert too close to home man, haha
[2:28:50] <BigCoffee> @callsigneagle01 Not really, it still looks hella generic right now, and the gameplay looks slow, and piss easy
[2:28:51] <callsigneagle01> You can also do the munitions cam with bombs too
[2:28:51] <%MagickBurritoh> NICE SAVE

[2:28:54] <callsigneagle01> @Iwantscandy It's always been geared towards controllers
[2:28:55] <Jashter18> So you are legally required to play this game with Danger Zone on loop right?
[2:28:55] <xBolts4Lifex> This is a nice treat before RE2 comes out :)
[2:28:56] <nina9669> oof
[2:28:57] <mercado94> are you for real Pat?

[2:28:58] <%THATGUY_789> who need red tube when you have Missle Cam
[2:28:58] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> (I joke)
[2:29:00] <casual_tj> I'm probably going to pick this up on PC.... It already looks soooo damn good
[2:29:00] <+StromkoPenguin> It's like Strike Commander's game play meets World Wrestling Federation's writing department.
[2:29:01] <2DSuperiority> zoneGasm
[2:29:02] <Triplicat> @CitrousCt other than video games my actual bullshit guess is that it's like the infinite ammo in mass effect 1
[2:29:02] <+DarkSunGvvyndolin> i tried to play an older AC game but i sucked so fucking hard that i just stopped
[2:29:02] <%Laecerelius> This jet can fit so many war crimes in it!

[2:30:00] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm more invested in the dog murder than the space elevator LUL
[2:30:02] <%AncelDeLambert> This is just Gundam with jets. I approve.

[2:30:28] <%TheyCallMeVawn> Metal Gear lives on in Ace Combat
[2:30:29] <%AncelDeLambert> It's a fully bipedal jet!
[2:30:31] <+Bloodxb> probably

[2:30:43] <seth45er> its a fly death moblie!
[2:30:43] <defectivefire718> @arcaderabbit48 its not so much pain share as it is damage share. because whatever the user does to himself really happens to the enemy. they dont just feel it.
[2:30:44] <echodrone81> it's like macross missiles, dont think too hard about where they are kept
[2:30:46] <artoflec> and Pineapples
[2:30:47] <+Jickiechan> ah okay
[2:30:47] <suikudo> might wanna resupply
[2:30:47] <lionmanguy> These drones are actually run by psychic little girls. Thought I'd forget about that bit didn't you MG, but I never will
[2:30:48] <sirmousehatter> How long till we get cow airplanes?
[2:30:49] <Gruhunchously> It would actually pretty cool if we had a game like this set in the Metal Gear universe.

[2:31:16] <+VietcongSamurai> If it gets us close to the A10 tho
[2:31:16] <arcaderabbit48> @defectivefire718 I feel like that might be good as a defensive Stand? Like yeah, you could turn me into a bomb but you'd blow yourself up too.

[2:48:01] <%OwlLightningMage> Everything is going big wrong WutFace
[2:48:02] <+Samaugsch2> @polengoldur Guns are best used when you’re really close to your target

[2:48:06] <+PNPLost_1> Guns are secondary in this kind of game
[2:48:07] <Polengoldur> ok but its better than just spinning in circles doing nothing
[2:48:09] <%ThePuddingDead> this is some metal gear music
[2:48:09] <+dpython> Only Ace Pilots use the gun
[2:48:09] <waifoong98> Guns aren't for scrub LUL

[3:00:19] <waifoong98> Wait, so you meant Tekken 7 STOLE FROM THIS? LUL
[3:00:20] <Blank9> the story of the kid in the town that yellow team occupies in 4 is the best

[3:00:52] <DexteraXIII> WHAT?
[3:00:53] <%TheSpiritof2277> Excuse me

[3:01:05] <+TheEvaFreak> YESSS
[3:01:05] <+enterprise900> AND ZERO PLAY THAT TOO
[3:01:05] <xBolts4Lifex> YES
[3:01:06] <Videogamer4> ZERO IS THE SHIT
[3:01:06] <%TheyCallMeVawn> 0, 4, and 5 are the holy trinity of Ace Combat
[3:01:07] <Halospaz117> 0,4,and 5 are the best ones
[3:01:07] <+dpython> yes
[3:01:08] <DestroyerDJ8> seems like this is the sequel to 5
[3:01:08] <Triplicat> 5 is great. Zero is the best one
[3:01:08] <Chewfungus> Yellow 13
[3:01:09] <+deVaras> 5 is the best one
[3:01:09] <+PNPLost_1> Belkan War is pretty good apparently.

[3:01:12] <Yusariz> Zero is the best
[3:01:13] <callsigneagle01> do it you nerd
[3:01:14] <subjectg> 5 and Zero are amazing
[3:01:14] <mrjohncarlton> Five is pretty good but REALLY melodramatic
[3:01:14] <%dmtph> Stream 5
[3:01:14] <artoflec> isnn't Ace Combat 3's subtitlte "ElectroSphere" or some shit
[3:01:15] <Blank9> 5 is great, 0 is the best
[3:01:15] <majindusto> FUCKING ALIENS
[3:01:15] <+KSabot> 5 is second best imo
[3:01:16] <+drflashylights> Yea
[3:01:16] <mesamus> zero and 5 are amazing
[3:01:16] <UPTONOGOOD18> Shattered Skies is the best imo
[3:01:18] <$QueequegTheater> 5 is widely consudered the best one
[3:01:19] <Stratiotai2> dude i miss playing ace combat 6
[3:01:19] <+fps_russia> Ace Combat : Independence Day

[3:01:20] <%TimBroome> 5 is great. Its got Razgris
[3:01:21] <%OwlLightningMage> I'm sold on Ace Combat now LUL
[3:01:22] <+JayEarly> Ace Combat has shockingly not cringy live-action FMV
[3:01:22] <xBolts4Lifex> You should plsy 5
[3:01:23] <+Gryphus23> 5 and Zero are the best ones
[3:01:23] <LunarDiscorded> You can still get 5 if you get the Deluxe Edition @AngriestPat
[3:01:24] <privatesargent> 6 is good too but it doesn't hold up to 0 4 and 5
[3:01:25] <Chewfungus> You fight the ai
[3:01:30] <BigCoffee> So can you skip 1-2-3 and not miss much?
[3:01:31] <Chewfungus> Ac3
[3:01:33] <waifoong98> Play all of them but AH
[3:01:33] <+JayEarly> Ace Combat Zero
[3:01:36] <%VRNK> 0 is the sequel to 5, right?
[3:01:38] <artoflec> just like Yakuza, 5 and 0 are the best ones
[3:01:38] <+enterprise900> 4, 5, and Zero are called the Holy Trinity of AC for a reason
[3:01:41] <callsigneagle01> @VRNK prequel
[3:01:42] <Blank9> 0 is the prequel actually
[3:01:42] <Triplicat> prequel VRNK
[3:01:42] <Gruhunchously> Our silent protagonist must remain silent.
[3:01:43] <@Moobot> Whoa I don't even shout that much! (@griffball13) (warning)
[3:01:46] <%jiin6> USE ALL THE GUNS
[3:01:46] <Raven1121> 5 ties into this game storyline well, its the same country
[3:01:47] <+deVaras> 5 is the dumbest so the best, it has nickleback
[3:01:48] <Valentinius_Anodyne> This is a procure on site mission
[3:01:48] <lionmanguy> Is this a stealth airplane mission?
[3:01:49] <HeadsHeldHigh> no weapons
[3:01:50] <mrjohncarlton> Zero is the best no contest, those duels with other squads were amazing
[3:01:50] <suikudo> Open Fire!
[3:01:50] <%griffball13> this is a stealth mission
[3:01:50] <sodium_station> A Jet stealth mission what
[3:01:52] <+Grayhammatter> so don't screw it upu
[3:01:52] <DesuDesuDokiDoki> @AngriestPat are you gonna stream all of this?
[3:01:52] <%sshen> Oh boy a stealth mission
[3:01:53] <Triplicat> god I forgot the melody of Unsung War until just now
[3:01:54] <%Cosairen> so, just fly good?
[3:01:57] <RoachOverlord> 2 is my favorite in the series but I know that's not really a popular opinion
[3:02:00] <callsigneagle01> fly good pat
[3:02:01] <Triplicat> what a god damn stellar piece of music
[3:02:02] <%CurrySauseBandit> Timed btw.
[3:02:02] <gekizenbu> remember the basics of Plane CQC
[3:02:03] <+Grayhammatter> do the fly good
[3:02:05] <Chewfungus> #BringbackCypher
[3:02:05] <+Gryphus23> rescue him so we can end the shutdown!
[3:02:09] <CalderGaming> pull up
[3:02:11] <+zetaplus> can you try that with cockpit mode?
[3:02:12] <%ThatGuyfromMars> this fucking music
[3:02:18] <%jiin6> too low
[3:02:18] <Blank9> 0's live action stuff was great
[3:02:19] <mesamus> early levels, still some tutorials on handling like the rest
[3:02:22] <sirmousehatter> Zero has you fighting named legendary pilots in full on duels
[3:02:23] <Gruhunchously> Why is the music so good?
[3:02:25] <callsigneagle01> Yeah most people don't know this but in AC3 it turns out the whole thing was just a simulation
[3:02:25] <xBolts4Lifex> can we see what cockpit view looks like in rain?
[3:02:26] <%Afterman_> hashtag wheres mitch
[3:02:28] <JackalKing> What is this somber Terminator music?
[3:02:29] <privatesargent> Ace Combat 3 is interesting in that is has a plot with multiple paths, though those paths were removed in the english release
[3:02:29] <Stratiotai2> this game though. looks amazing
[3:02:30] <Valdorick> Zero is amazing
[3:02:31] <majindusto> STEALTHPLANE

[3:02:37] <%crimsonharvest> You know whats real scary, in Elite Dangerous when your canopy breaks and takes most of your HUD with it. Does this game have that kind of shit?
[3:02:37] <+deVaras> 5 had the whole squad with you in every mission
[3:02:38] <%Luna_Ashford> Pat is this on PC, cause I'm thinking about buying it

[3:55:19] <+drflashylights> It’s ace combat, ofc the music is top notch
[3:55:21] <callsigneagle01> Nah
[3:55:24] <CitrousCt> Hope that Ace Combat 8 either takes place after 3 or retcons it. Either or really
[3:55:26] <1stpigeon2scuba> If you can dodge a rocket you can dodge a ball

[3:55:50] <privatesargent> @lionmanguy most planes are real planes, with a few conceptual planes thrown in, an at the end usually 1 or 2 super plane that is fictional

[3:56:18] <CitrousCt> No, Danger Zone would never be associated with a Europlane
[3:56:21] <Marco_Apollo> i though he wasnt meant to kill the ground targets
[3:56:23] <VeryTricky> can you play this in first person?
[3:56:25] <R3c0n31> @Gruhunchously oh i know but seeing it from this perspective makes it seem so close to us no flying creatures
[3:56:27] <RoachOverlord> most ground targets only take 1 missile
[3:56:33] <mesamus> yeah there's cockpit mode
[3:56:35] <subjectg> There’s cockpit view yea
[3:56:49] <CitrousCt> There's also PSVR compataible missions
[3:56:50] <callsigneagle01> You want a crazy story? The reveal trailer for this game came out my freshman year in university. It's just now coming out and I graduated in August.

[3:59:54] <EMP_Ike_Turner> When’s the alien mothership
[3:59:55] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @Jickiechan he didn't play FO today
[3:59:58] <CalderGaming> hi steve blum

[4:00:04] <+Jickiechan> ah okay

[4:00:08] <%Skrypto> @Jickiechan no it was Onimusha and Ace Combat tonight
[4:00:10] <%THATGUY_789> Mi:Fall Out
[4:00:11] <+chrishnaw> Where's the tunnel?
[4:00:18] <RoachOverlord> don't really need to use 2 missiles on all these ground targets
[4:00:21] <%ThePuddingDead> Solitary seems to be the go to huh?
[4:00:26] <waifoong98> Damn Itano Circus man, what an amazing idea
[4:00:33] <VeryTricky> yea i dont think i played hawx prob was an ace combat
[4:00:42] <Valdorick> Its almost like you're expendable prisoners they send on suicide missions, and want you dead because you're a suicide squad they never plan to release from prison and thus need you to die from exhaustion.
[4:00:46] <VeryTricky> fuck that was so long ago
[4:00:50] <%Cosairen> jesus how close do you need to be
[4:00:53] <+paladinstarbuster> Okay but im actually playing danger zone now and its sick
[4:00:53] <DRAGKUDO> is this in VR too?
[4:00:54] <+kuervojones> Pat. are you an Ace?
[4:00:55] <%crimsonharvest> Those bridges are probably billions of dollars worth of infrastructure
[4:01:02] <callsigneagle01> You can use missile cam with bombs too
[4:01:03] <mesamus> oh yeah i forgot hawx was a thing
[4:01:10] <nina9669> weres pats health?
[4:01:11] <privatesargent> @ThePuddingDead they can't really do anything that can be detrimental to your health, you aren't useful if you can't fly
[4:01:12] <callsigneagle01> but there's no more
[4:01:14] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> @ThePuddingDead "We're going to put you in communal!" doesn't have the same ring to it
[4:01:17] <callsigneagle01> always a shame
[4:01:21] <CitrousCt> @Valdorick It says something though that penal pilots are allowed to fly high-end 5th gen fighters
[4:01:21] <sirmousehatter> @Cosairen you are never close enough
[4:01:24] <%ThePuddingDead> i know right?
[4:01:28] <WizzardOne> but you have 50 mssl
[4:01:29] <subjectg> Remember that your gun is useful for ground targets too

[4:10:38] <raminnoodle420> the hell
[4:10:39] <+paladinstarbuster> hes done
[4:10:40] <callsigneagle01> You might need to get a better jet
[4:10:41] <%NopeBadguy> solitary NotLikeThis
[4:10:41] <%ThatGuyfromMars> solitary if you do well, solitary if you fail
[4:10:41] <+zaworldo> AGANE
[4:10:42] <reonome> use your guns
[4:10:43] <waifoong98> Use gun man
[4:10:44] <%dmtph> Hit more ground targets
[4:10:44] <callsigneagle01> or change the loadout
[4:10:45] <nepwar> ~uptime
[4:10:45] <suikudo> So close
[4:10:45] <%IMDRanged> What console version is this? or PC?
[4:10:47] <Blank9> don't fight the drones
[4:10:47] <sirmousehatter> At this point, who's NOT in solitary
[4:10:47] <+Magnetoplasmadynamic> I think the AA guns are not worth that much.
[4:10:47] <SeventyForce> Use gunnn paaatttt
[4:10:47] <acurasgaming> :O really !!!! yeey!!!!!! since my wife claimed my ps4 for netflix
[4:10:48] <%RantingRavager> use gun?
[4:10:49] <+paladinstarbuster> night
[4:10:49] <callsigneagle01> It's more than the gun guys
[4:10:50] <%kiiiirsten> don't coward out
[4:10:50] <%dmtph> Single missles
[4:10:51] <%crimsonharvest> Stay focused on score i guess
[4:10:51] <SargeantDestroy> I believe in you, Pat.
[4:10:51] <subjectg> Or better yet focus on your objecive
[4:10:52] <nina9669> use gun
[4:10:52] <%ThePuddingDead> whats the most points? warehouses?
[4:10:52] <+Extrallent> maybe you need to use the guns more
[4:10:52] <%Laecerelius> focus on blowing up the base and not shooting down drones
[4:10:53] <%THATGUY_789> u spin me right round baby right round
[4:10:53] <RoachOverlord> you need some better anti ground weapons
[4:10:54] <privatesargent> guns work well on ground targets
[4:10:54] <echodrone81> guns for stationary targets
[4:10:54] <BeefyQueefer> "how dare you kill only nearly the amount we expected, to prison forever with you"
[4:10:54] <%ThatGuyfromMars> @IMDRanged PS4
[4:10:54] <WizzardOne> why did you resuply with 50 missles
[4:10:55] <Fujiwara_92> Change your jet
[4:10:56] <lionmanguy> Just don't shoot at drones and focus on ground targets for points
[4:10:58] <%TheSpiritof2277> Like it's not gonna be solitary either way
[4:10:58] <%MagickBurritoh> even with the better plane?
[4:10:59] <Chewfungus> Focus ground unit
[4:11:00] <+LordLicoriceThe3rd> Prepare for some hardcore tickling trigger
[4:11:02] <ScreamingMeat> Why why do they want to put you in solitary?
[4:11:02] <mesamus> single missiles and gun pat
[4:11:03] <%kiiiirsten> points points points!
[4:11:04] <%crimsonharvest> Maybe even fly slow and strafe?
[4:11:04] <LuxCapere> why ur fingernails be so fuckn grimey when u in solitary???
[4:11:05] <callsigneagle01> He needs something with a bit more ground punch I think
[4:11:07] <+VireisSymphony> @AngriestPat You spent alot of time chaseing Drones.
[4:11:07] <Nazgul240> drones were a big distraction
[4:11:07] <Dakuu75> can you gun and missile at same time?
[4:11:07] <%IMDRanged> @ThatGuyfromMars Cool. Thank you.
[4:11:08] <Rivalshotzgp> Don’t go for warehouses those give the least points
[4:11:08] <%Niney_Who> AA Guns aren't worth many points at all cause you gotta destroy stuff to help GROUND Troops later on @AngriestPat
[4:11:08] <%THATGUY_789> need more GDP
[4:11:08] <subjectg> you just need to not waste time shooting down drones basically
[4:11:10] <+guyremex> is this worth a flight stick?
[4:11:11] <KaseKaizer> gotta bust out the A-10
[4:11:12] <callsigneagle01> That's just replay mission
[4:11:13] <waifoong98> Wow.....
[4:11:14] <UPTONOGOOD18> You need to do low speed strafes with funs
